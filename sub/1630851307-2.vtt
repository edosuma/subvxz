WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:06.214
Previously, on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

00:07.424 --> 00:09.467
Being back on the
Dalmatian Coast

00:09.509 --> 00:11.803
based in Sibenik,
it's nature, country.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.804
I love that.

00:12.846 --> 00:13.805
-Hi!
-Welcome back.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.223
Thank you!

00:15.265 --> 00:16.266
-Lloyd? Malia.
-Yeah. Nice to meet you.

00:16.307 --> 00:17.475
Nice to meet you.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.060
-I'm Lexi.
-I'm Katie.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.478
-Where are you from?
-I'm from Bahamas.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.523
I was Miss Bahamas,
but I don't tell people.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.191
I did a Miss Bahamas pageant.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.443
Wow.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.111
-Hey, Z.
-Hey...

00:30.280 --> 00:32.532
I didn't realize
Z was that green.

00:32.574 --> 00:35.118
Is this your first boat?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.120
I'll have you on lates,
I'll stay on mids.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.039
I do wanna rotate.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.291
I don't consider myself
a typical chief stew.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.376
I think you get more
out of your crew

00:43.418 --> 00:44.836
if you keep a good vibe on board

00:44.878 --> 00:46.296
as opposed to if
you're just a psycho bitch

00:46.338 --> 00:47.547
telling them what to do.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.548
They're gonna be
like [bleep] you.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.175
Hi, Mathew.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.176
You've worked for some
impressive people.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.053
Yeah.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.554
I've been a private chef for
Rupert Murdoch, Hugh Jackman.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.599
I'm always nervous
when I go into a new job.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.142
I just hope people like me.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.728
Terez, her husband
Lee, co-primaries;

01:01.770 --> 01:03.396
Clint and his fiancé, Karry.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.690
They decided to
have a wedding ceremony

01:05.732 --> 01:07.275
with their closest friends.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.404
-Is that whole truck full?
-Coming down the stairs.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.405
Coming up the stairs.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.074
Corner.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.451
The walk-ins are two floors
down a windy staircase.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.412
I'm not prepped at all.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.580
I hurt my knee last night.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.248
I'm freaked out.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.250
-Okay. So, what...
-I don't know what to do.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.627
I can't do this.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.756
Our chef injured himself.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.508
-There will be no chef?
-No chef?

01:31.549 --> 01:33.259
We need to make dinner.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.721
Whoa! Savage.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.143
This is why chefs are
always so angry.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.232
You can do better.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.860
Terrible.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.363
I have failed them.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.749
Girl, this is not okay.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.209
Did you taste dinner?

02:06.251 --> 02:09.671
That was terrible.

02:09.713 --> 02:10.922
Yes, unacceptable.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.550
I agree.
We didn't have a chef.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.593
-We're on a mega yacht.
-I get it.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.262
-Sorry, I...
-We're on a mega yacht!

02:17.303 --> 02:18.930
You're better than that,
so let's get that.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.473
Let's get the respect
we deserve.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.851
Hopefully I can sort this out.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.769
You got it.
You got it, Sandy.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.813
I've never been in this position
in my entire career.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.189
And you know why?
Because of COVID.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.566
Yeah.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.609
There's a seven
days' quarantine.

02:31.651 --> 02:32.610
Otherwise, I could get
a chef here.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.696
This is their wedding.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.489
I'm scared for them, and I'm
terrified what's gonna happen.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.283
We really are so easy to please.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.284
-We really are.
-I know.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.285
Come on, girl.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.286
We are on your team.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.287
All right, thank you.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.663
I get it.

02:43.705 --> 02:46.332
I don't have a chef,
I have a new crew.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.834
It's never easy
to hear criticism.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.377
I have to shoulder it.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.712
All I can do is try
to please tem.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.677
Unacceptable.
It's bullsh--.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.512
Night.

02:59.554 --> 03:00.513
Are you going to bed?

03:00.555 --> 03:01.514
-Yeah.
-Oh!

03:01.556 --> 03:02.515
Thank you so much for your help.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.267
That's okay.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.811
I'm more than happy to help
out in any department,

03:06.853 --> 03:08.980
but imagine
the disappointment of paying

03:09.022 --> 03:11.691
this huge amount of money
to find me in the galley,

03:11.733 --> 03:13.485
having anything to do
with your food.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.698
How you going?

03:18.740 --> 03:19.699
This is all clean.

03:19.741 --> 03:20.909
I wanna knock you off,

03:20.950 --> 03:22.744
and me and Lexi
will smash out the pans.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.412
Okay, cool.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.705
For breakfast, just do starter,
knife, and cutlery.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.374
Yeah.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.542
I mean, is he gonna be back
to do, like, a platter?

03:29.584 --> 03:30.543
I need to talk to Sandy.

03:30.585 --> 03:31.544
I don't know.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.380
Losing a chef...

03:33.421 --> 03:35.256
that's like losing a limb
in yachting world, you know?

03:35.298 --> 03:38.885
I am praying that Mathew will
come back, but I swear to God,

03:38.927 --> 03:40.970
I wanna strangle
his little head.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.347
Don't stress too much.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.556
Thank you.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.438
Was this a bad dream,
or did this really happen?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.606
I don't know.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.732
-Dinner was terrible.
-Yeah.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.858
-I get it.
-Yeah.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.443
[bleep]

03:55.485 --> 03:56.528
Don't make me a bad guy.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.447
Go, goodbye, out, out, out.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.242
So, he's coming back tomorrow,
right, for breakfast?

04:02.283 --> 04:03.618
Okay.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.248
Yeah.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.791
Ah.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.043
I've never seen this
in yachting, when the crew,

04:12.085 --> 04:15.005
who are not chefs,
have cooked for the guests.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.757
This is probably the biggest
disaster I've been faced with.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.843
And, like,
we've crashed tenders.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.804
No, I don't want you to do
anything for me.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.931
It's fine.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.016
We're gonna go dance.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.434
Going up to the top.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.977
It's bullsh--!

04:29.019 --> 04:31.021
I know, babe, but you're getting
mad at me for this trip.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.439
I'm not mad at you.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.606
We're not getting
our money back,

04:33.648 --> 04:34.649
it doesn't matter at this point.

04:34.691 --> 04:35.734
I don't give a sh--.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.985
-Babe, look at me.
-What?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.486
I love you.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.656
Woo!

04:43.825 --> 04:46.453
-Woot, woot, woot.
-Yeah!

04:46.494 --> 04:47.620
[neck cracks]

04:47.662 --> 04:48.788
Ow.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.040
First day of charter ever.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.666
It's in the books.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.793
Thank you so much for your
guidance and help today.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.337
Yeah, of course.
7:00 on deck.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.963
Lovely.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.466
Actually just happy to not
get fired on my first day...

05:03.845 --> 05:05.680
When I catch myself in a mirror,

05:05.722 --> 05:08.350
I'm like, oh, my hair
is, like sh--.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.479
-You were in a beauty pageant?
-I know. Yeah.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.688
What beauty pageant was it?

05:13.730 --> 05:15.315
-Miss Bahamas.
-You were Miss Bahamas?

05:15.357 --> 05:17.359
-Yes.
-That's so cool!

05:17.400 --> 05:20.403
Yeah, I went to Russia for
the Miss Universe title.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.571
Nice!

05:25.784 --> 05:26.951
Ooh.

05:31.039 --> 05:31.998
No.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.583
-Do it!
-Katie, come on.

05:33.625 --> 05:34.834
Oh, God.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.088
-Nice!
-She's flying!

05:38.129 --> 05:39.464
You know how to ride,
you know...

05:43.176 --> 05:44.761
You gotta lean forward on...
around it.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.013
-Yay!
-Yeah!

05:47.055 --> 05:48.890
That's how you do it!

05:48.932 --> 05:50.892
Yay!

05:50.934 --> 05:52.977
Whew.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.022
I was actually really impressed
how strong she was.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.399
You are yummy.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.530
Girl, you're the... you're...
girl, you're our girl.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.864
That's great.

06:04.906 --> 06:08.702
Top gun. Take me to be
or lose me forever.

06:08.743 --> 06:09.953
I'm ready for bed.

06:09.994 --> 06:13.915
Katie, tomorrow I will
lift you higher,

06:13.957 --> 06:15.542
and your legs will...

06:15.583 --> 06:17.585
I hope you guys sleep well.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.131
-Good night!
-Good night.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.550
-Good night, guys.
-Thank you so much.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.680
Nice, doing the log book.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.723
Yeah.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.724
Did you get some sleep?

06:30.765 --> 06:31.933
-A little bit.
-Cool.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.476
-All right, good night.
-All right.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.978
I've been at anchor on
smaller boats,

06:35.020 --> 06:36.813
and then before that,
all my previous jobs,

06:36.855 --> 06:38.815
I've been around lots
and lots of people.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.066
I spent four years selling cars,

06:40.108 --> 06:42.152
which was the worst time
of my life.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.112
On my first day, they pulled me
into the office

06:44.154 --> 06:45.905
when they heard one of my
phone calls,

06:45.947 --> 06:48.992
and they made me stay late,
stand on a table, on the phone,

06:49.034 --> 06:51.202
calling people while
people threw things at me,

06:51.244 --> 06:53.455
to make me smile while
I was speaking on the phone.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.499
That really sculpted
the way that I am today.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.834
At the time, it's hateful.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.842
Let's vacuum all this.
And do sky lounge, I think.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.093
Okay.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.930
All crew, all crew, that
is Malia off the radio.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.223
Okay.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.816
[bleep] I need to go to bed.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.618
Ooh, okay.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.161
I'm basically done vacuuming.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.746
-Okay.
-I'm gonna shoot off.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.081
-Are you all good?
-Yeah.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.041
Sweep, mop, and then going down.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.085
All right, thank you so much.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.628
Get some rest.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.963
Let's try!

07:44.005 --> 07:46.508
How the [bleep] are we
gonna survive the rest

07:46.549 --> 07:48.510
of the season if
this is day one?

07:48.551 --> 07:49.969
Like, you know,
some people can

07:50.011 --> 07:51.137
handle the pressure and
all that sh--.

07:51.179 --> 07:53.598
I don't want to,
but I can do it.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.642
I went to boarding school
when I was 13.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.269
I actually chose to go.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.146
I mean, it definitely
had its hard moments,

08:00.188 --> 08:02.065
but that's why I am
so independent,

08:02.107 --> 08:04.859
because, like, you know,
I didn't go back

08:04.901 --> 08:06.736
to my parents every
day after school.

08:06.778 --> 08:11.241
I just, yeah, went to a hostel
with a really psycho matron.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.961
Why?

08:28.133 --> 08:29.634
[phone vibrates]

08:29.676 --> 08:31.761
Hey, Mom,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.138
I'm just going to bed.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.723
I'm used to working
hard on a charter,

08:34.764 --> 08:37.642
but this is, like, madness.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.978
I hate when people say
"Everything's gonna be okay."

08:40.020 --> 08:41.229
I really, really hate that.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.857
A couple months ago,
my dad died.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.693
He'd had, like,
a sudden brain aneurism,

08:46.735 --> 08:48.862
and my mom rushed him
to the hospital.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.530
Because it's a pandemic,

08:50.572 --> 08:52.699
you can't have your loved
one there with you.

08:52.741 --> 08:53.867
So, when she left and got home,

08:53.908 --> 08:55.285
that's when they called her

08:55.326 --> 08:56.286
and said, like,
"Well, he didn't make it."

08:56.327 --> 08:57.704
We were so confused.

08:57.746 --> 08:58.705
We were, like,
"What do you mean,

08:58.747 --> 08:59.706
he was just there, talking."

08:59.748 --> 09:01.207
I'm just tired.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.128
Talking about him makes me,
like, sad,

09:05.170 --> 09:08.214
because I haven't really grieved
the way I feel like I need to.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.052
I'll message you later.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.261
Love you, bye.

09:27.609 --> 09:28.902
Sh--.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.698
Hey.
Morning.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.243
Morning.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.370
What's it looking
like out there?

09:38.411 --> 09:39.621
Pretty horrendous.

09:40.789 --> 09:41.748
No.

09:41.790 --> 09:42.749
-Serious?
-Yeah.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.834
Oh [bleep].

09:44.876 --> 09:46.294
We're toast if he doesn't...

09:46.336 --> 09:47.879
well, we won't have any toast.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.339
I can do it.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.799
Get a cup of tea.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.384
We have a bachelor
party to throw.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.968
Yeah.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.392
-Morning.
-Hi.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.769
Can I get you a tea or coffee,
or anything?

10:02.811 --> 10:04.270
-Coffee would be nice.
-Coffee, yeah?

10:11.736 --> 10:13.029
No.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.283
Coffee!

10:22.330 --> 10:25.750
Who has a chef on backup
with seven days' quarantine?

10:25.792 --> 10:26.960
I have to figure this out.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.296
Please, God.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.881
Also, I need a deck stew,

10:31.923 --> 10:34.259
because I will
never be caught

10:34.300 --> 10:35.802
without a crewmember
in quarantine again.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.679
I learned my lesson.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.389
If you guys are hungry, I can
probably do some toasts, or...

10:41.182 --> 10:43.059
Some fruit? Yeah.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.437
That is the only time
I've ever been told that.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.861
I was just thinking
the same thing.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.071
Where's another knife?

10:55.113 --> 10:56.406
Up there.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.791
So, is he making breakfast,
is there a breakfast?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.960
Like, what's going on,
I'm so confused.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.004
[phone vibrates]

11:11.046 --> 11:13.089
Hey, Mathew, how are you?

11:23.475 --> 11:26.102
Hey, Mathew, how are you?

11:28.438 --> 11:29.939
and, uh...

11:39.491 --> 11:41.409
I'm glad you're okay,
first and foremost.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.410
Thank you.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.411
Will you be here for breakfast?

11:43.453 --> 11:44.954
-Yes.
-Okay, cool.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.164
-All right, thank you.
-Bye.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.832
Bye-bye.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.417
As a captain, I've had
fires on the Red Sea,

11:49.459 --> 11:52.879
I've faced pirates,
but no chef...

11:52.921 --> 11:53.922
that's, like, end game.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.423
So, the big question is,

11:55.465 --> 11:59.427
is Mathew capable of continuing
in the charter season?

11:59.469 --> 12:01.888
Yes!

12:01.930 --> 12:04.349
All crew, all crew,
our chef is returning.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.102
-Thank the Lord.
-Hallelujah.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.438
Morning, how was
your gym workout?

12:10.480 --> 12:11.564
It was good, thank you.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.531
Yeah.
I think Malia's great.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.157
Like, really, really great.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.910
Thanks for taking care of
everything this morning.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.956
I think it's gonna be
like this all day, so...

12:27.997 --> 12:29.040
Yeah.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.960
Oh, why didn't you come get me?

12:32.002 --> 12:33.003
They've all just been up.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.045
Are they okay, though, or...

12:34.087 --> 12:36.297
Yeah, they're fine.

12:36.339 --> 12:40.176
All crew, all crew,
water taxi approaching.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.344
Hopefully that is our chef.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.929
[bleep] yeah.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.514
Could you guys meet him
on the swim platform?

12:44.556 --> 12:45.515
[bleep]

12:45.557 --> 12:47.183
Hey!

12:47.225 --> 12:48.476
Chef's on board.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.477
-Good morning.
-Welcome back!

12:49.519 --> 12:51.187
Thank you!

12:51.229 --> 12:52.313
Let me go get changed,
and I'll get right to it.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.398
-Okay, awesome.
-Welcome back.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.399
-Hey, good morning!
-Hey.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.152
Morning.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.153
-Good morning, Katie.
-Good morning, Katie.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.404
How did you guys sleep?

12:59.446 --> 13:00.989
We slept good,
thank you for asking.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.032
-I slept good, yeah.
-Yeah?

13:02.073 --> 13:03.074
Yeah.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.534
All right...

13:04.576 --> 13:06.494
How are you, how's your knee,
what happened?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.913
It wasn't anything serious, but
I'm in a little bit of pain.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.373
Are the guests up?

13:10.415 --> 13:12.125
Yeah, they'll probably
want some food soon.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.460
I'll get some avo toast going.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.504
I have this deep
anxiety inside of me

13:16.546 --> 13:18.590
before that first meal
for a new guest,

13:18.631 --> 13:22.135
and instead of just getting over
that and doing it, I bailed.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.306
I'm gonna do the fruit ASAP.

13:26.348 --> 13:29.059
Two jobs in the past,
I have actually left

13:29.100 --> 13:32.145
before I started
because of anxiety.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.606
It's something I need
and want to overcome.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.900
I'm very sorry for the delay.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.444
Good morning.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.529
Is it all right if
I just plate and egg this

13:41.571 --> 13:43.031
with scrambled eggs,
sautéed spinach,

13:43.073 --> 13:44.574
and a piece of bacon on it?

13:44.616 --> 13:45.617
Yeah, normally we would do
it to order, just... yeah.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.202
Yeah, yes, starting tomorrow,

13:47.243 --> 13:48.203
I'll have pastries,
breakfast to order.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.204
Cool, cool, cool.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.330
We got the...

13:58.922 --> 14:00.256
Yeah.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.635
Not today.

14:03.677 --> 14:04.636
Not today.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.637
Hello!

14:05.679 --> 14:07.222
Good morning, big boy.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.390
-Vibin', brah!
-Vibin'.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.058
You wanna line up
a sheet of that?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.434
-Bacon!
-Bacon!

14:11.476 --> 14:13.228
Oh [bleep].

14:13.269 --> 14:14.479
Are we gonna meet the chef?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.231
Yeah, he's back on board.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.441
Thank God.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.236
Good.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.113
I have worked with
so many chefs,

14:23.154 --> 14:24.989
so I think he freaked
the [bleep] out.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.992
He owes us big time, and
I will make sure he knows it.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.620
But now he's here,
he's not leaving.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.455
Well, let's hope not.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.249
Bacon!

14:34.290 --> 14:35.500
Wow, looks like it'll pair
well with this toast.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.377
Yum!

14:39.504 --> 14:41.464
Was yesterday a disaster?

14:43.675 --> 14:45.176
Hm.

14:53.268 --> 14:54.519
Feel awful.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.026
Okay, guys. It looks like
there is gonna be a break.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.193
We're gonna put
the tender in now.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.194
Okay.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.362
Hey.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.572
These eggs are good.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.115
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, the bacon is good.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.450
Bacon, bacon, bacon.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.618
What a ----ing bad start
to the trip, though.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.120
How's it going?

15:12.162 --> 15:13.121
-Oh, here she is.
-Good, thank you.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.414
Yeah, of course.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.415
I'm about to go talk
to the guests.

15:15.457 --> 15:16.583
Oh, great.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.959
Not a great start
for the galley.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.377
So, if we could get
crew meals out,

15:19.419 --> 15:21.129
if I could get the wedding
cake ordered in...

15:21.171 --> 15:24.424
anything to give me more time
to focus on other stuff,

15:24.466 --> 15:27.135
you know, so I can have
a little redemption

15:27.177 --> 15:30.138
here for this trip, you know?

15:30.180 --> 15:31.723
-Crew food.
-Crew food.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.433
We gotta do crew food.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.684
Yeah, I'm...
I don't know the space.

15:34.726 --> 15:35.727
I'm still getting used to it.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.270
Okay.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.439
There's sh-- everywhere,
I'm in pain.

15:39.481 --> 15:42.150
The more I can outsource
the things

15:42.192 --> 15:45.362
that don't matter to the guests,
the better I can...

15:45.403 --> 15:46.654
the more I can focus on...

15:46.696 --> 15:48.156
So, is anyone helping
you right now?

15:48.198 --> 15:50.283
They are, but they're
doing their job.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.326
I'm gonna go speak
to the guests.

15:59.334 --> 15:59.751
How's it going?

16:00.877 --> 16:02.212
Not a great start
for the galley.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.838
So, if we could get
crew meals out,

16:03.880 --> 16:05.548
I could get the wedding
cake ordered in...

16:05.590 --> 16:09.719
anything to give me more time
to focus on other stuff,

16:09.761 --> 16:12.347
you know, so I can have
a little redemption

16:12.389 --> 16:15.350
here for this trip, you know?

16:15.392 --> 16:17.143
-Crew food.
-Crew food.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.812
We gotta do crew food.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.647
I don't know the space.
I'm still getting used to it.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.190
Okay.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.358
There's sh-- everywhere,
I'm in pain.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.070
The more I can outsource
the things

16:27.112 --> 16:30.407
that don't matter to the guests,
the better I can...

16:30.448 --> 16:31.741
the more I can focus on...

16:31.783 --> 16:33.326
So, is anyone helping
you right now?

16:33.368 --> 16:34.744
They are, but
they're doing their job.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.287
I'm gonna go speak
to the guests.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.708
Chefs are very finicky,
some temperamental.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.293
So, the last thing
I'm gonna do is bombard him

16:42.335 --> 16:43.837
when he's asked for help.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.715
I don't have
another chef lined up,

16:46.756 --> 16:48.425
so I have to play
my cards right

16:48.466 --> 16:50.135
and ease him back
into this role.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.302
-Good morning, everyone.
-Morning!

16:51.344 --> 16:53.138
Hey!

16:53.179 --> 16:55.306
I'm Mathew, I am so sorry
for the start of this trip.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.307
-All right!
-He's back!

16:56.349 --> 16:57.600
How you feeling, how you doing?

16:57.642 --> 16:58.601
I'm sore,
but I'm feeling better.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.353
Awesome.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.480
For lunch, I was thinking
mussels, potato roasties,

17:02.522 --> 17:03.732
a chocolate mousse dessert.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.275
-Yep.
-And for dinner, Italian style.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.110
Yes, we're so happy
to have you back!

17:07.152 --> 17:08.111
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Mathew.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.529
Thank you.

17:09.571 --> 17:10.739
He's gonna pull out
some stops for sure.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.657
Hey, crew food...
paninis again?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.200
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.201
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.244
Thank you.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.787
Will you let your team know?

17:17.829 --> 17:20.123
Yeah.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.499
-What up?
-Good morning!

17:21.541 --> 17:22.792
Excited for today!

17:22.834 --> 17:25.462
We need to get out
the unicorn island.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.671
Copy.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.214
Courtney...

17:28.256 --> 17:29.591
Will do, copy.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.259
Oh, that's the
giant, giant unicorn.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.552
-Is it?
-Yeah.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.512
Do you wanna hold this?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.264
-Yeah.
-And inflate.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.265
Hey, morning.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.475
How are you?

17:38.516 --> 17:40.518
-Did you sleep?
-Got a few hours in.

17:43.688 --> 17:44.647
Thank you for yesterday.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.149
Oh, no problem.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.817
-I hope I did everything...
-You did.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.611
Okay.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.239
-So, we'll have him for lunch.
-Yeah.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.658
After speaking to my mom,
I'm more relaxed.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.619
I'm more, like,
you had a bad night,

17:57.660 --> 17:59.412
you're exhausted,
you're overworked.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.289
Just have a few hours of sleep,

18:01.331 --> 18:03.625
cry it out, and then get back
to work, we have a boat to run.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.460
Courtney's started cabins.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.463
She's pretty much done VIP,
so smash out some laundry,

18:08.505 --> 18:10.256
there's some guest stuff
that I just want cleared.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.508
-All righty.
-Thank you so much.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.550
No prob.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.885
I love it!

18:14.928 --> 18:16.680
It is huge!
I know!

18:16.721 --> 18:18.640
Does this not scream
"bachelorette party?"

18:18.682 --> 18:20.183
-Is that new?
-Maiden voyage.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.352
We're gonna break 'er in well.

18:22.394 --> 18:23.853
-Today's gonna be fun.
-What should we name her?

18:23.895 --> 18:24.854
Maureen.

18:24.896 --> 18:25.939
Maureen the Magical Unicorn.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.399
Yeah.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.864
Feels amazing.

18:36.574 --> 18:37.534
Two girls and a hot tub.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.702
Cheers, babe.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.662
It's giving me life right now.

18:40.704 --> 18:41.663
Yo, what up, Lexi?

18:41.705 --> 18:42.747
Are you feeling much better?

18:43.748 --> 18:44.958
Oh!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.876
I'm just trying
to stay positive.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.004
I'm in a weird headspace,
I'm still in a lot of pain,

18:49.045 --> 18:51.006
so I just have to,
like, internalize,

18:51.047 --> 18:53.466
like, all right,
be calm, be calm.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.850
You guys, if you're ever
setting up the swim platform

19:01.891 --> 19:03.226
-and I'm not here...
-Yeah.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.561
Like, this is what I like.

19:04.602 --> 19:08.273
Oh sh--, unicorn down.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.401
Go!

19:11.443 --> 19:13.319
Yay!

19:13.361 --> 19:15.947
We'll do three of the Russian
vodka Bloody Marys, extra dirty.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.407
-Yeah.
-Thanks, Katie.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.575
Morning, Lloyd.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.368
-Morning.
-Paninis for lunch!

19:20.410 --> 19:21.703
Oh, sick, yeah, all good.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.329
Bloody Mary.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.748
Paninis again?

19:26.374 --> 19:27.625
Yay!

19:27.667 --> 19:29.836
And we have
a bachelor party to throw.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.629
There's three Bloody Marys.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.757
Is it possible to push lunch
back to 1:00 at the latest?

19:33.798 --> 19:35.675
-Absolutely.
-Cool.

19:35.717 --> 19:36.843
Oh, I did, sorry.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.803
No, you're...
no worries.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.513
I'll make another one and then
I've got two espresso martinis.

19:40.555 --> 19:41.765
I'll take another one.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.308
Okay, cool...
two more Bloody Marys.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.642
Bloody.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.312
Three Bloody Marys,
an espresso martini?

19:48.813 --> 19:49.773
The paninis?

19:49.814 --> 19:50.774
Just gonna get some veg.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.026
Trying to find radishes, really.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.070
Honestly, mate, I'm not entirely
sure what a radish looks like.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.696
They sent me down
earlier to get...

19:56.738 --> 19:58.281
I can't even remember.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.908
It's a green leaf of
some description.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.534
A green leaf of some...

20:01.576 --> 20:02.786
It's kale.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.330
[bleep] my life.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.539
Oop.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.546
I come from Brighton,
in the south of England.

20:13.588 --> 20:14.881
It was a wicked city
to grow up in.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.633
First gay marriage in the UK,

20:16.675 --> 20:18.468
and it was held
in the Royal Pavilion,

20:18.510 --> 20:22.681
which ironically, Hitler wanted
as his summer palace, so, ha.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.394
Bloody hell, how many
bits of ham has it got in it?

20:27.435 --> 20:28.520
"Ham" without the "H."

20:35.777 --> 20:38.655
I have an espresso martini
and three...

20:38.697 --> 20:41.116
Katie, Katie, Lexi.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.702
Lexi, you need to hold on.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.036
Ugh.

20:47.372 --> 20:48.832
-Okay, two mimosas...
-Yeah.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.959
-A shot of Café Patron...
-I want a shot as well.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.669
Two Café Patrons.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.504
Can I just get a regular
tequila?

20:54.546 --> 20:56.006
Cool.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.675
My arms, my poor arms!

20:58.717 --> 21:00.051
All I've done is this.

21:01.553 --> 21:03.096
-Really?
-I literally...

21:03.138 --> 21:06.391
I'm not a stewardess
anymore, I'm a bartender.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.893
I cannot do anything else
except for make drinks.

21:11.563 --> 21:12.522
Coming up...

21:12.564 --> 21:13.815
Can you help me deliver these?

21:13.857 --> 21:15.442
I'd do anything for you.

21:15.483 --> 21:16.860
-I just love you.
-Do you really?

21:16.901 --> 21:18.028
I do.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.529
You always lie to the chef.

21:25.660 --> 21:26.202
Hey, there you are.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.039
-This is ----ing nightmare.
-Really?

21:29.080 --> 21:31.541
I cannot do anything else
except for make drinks.

21:31.583 --> 21:32.751
That's fine, I'm pulling all
the laundry, we're gonna set up.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.210
Don't worry about wine glasses,

21:34.252 --> 21:35.587
because they're drinking
all different stuff.

21:35.628 --> 21:36.588
-Okay, only water glasses.
-Yeah.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.922
All right.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.807
Panini master.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.184
Getting there.

21:53.605 --> 21:56.024
Tequila, and two mimosas.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.153
-I would like vodka water.
-Can I do Tito's?

22:00.195 --> 22:02.697
Okay.
Can we do one order?

22:02.739 --> 22:04.657
Otherwise, you're not
gonna be eating lunch.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.785
Even better, bring a
bottle of champagne on ice,

22:06.826 --> 22:09.621
a carafe of OJ,
and we'll refill ourselves.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.663
Okay.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.624
Okay, next step is fishing trip.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.750
I'll stock the coolers.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.126
Do you wanna start rigging?

22:15.168 --> 22:16.878
Yeah, I can put something
together for them.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.005
If it was my bachelor party,
I'd, like, you know,

22:19.047 --> 22:23.510
get cigars, turn up the music,
jump off the boat.

22:23.551 --> 22:24.511
That's just me.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.221
Deck crew is doing good.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.473
I mean, I think we're still
getting everyone up to speed.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.017
I don't see any red flags yet,

22:31.059 --> 22:33.853
so we're gonna be okay
for now, hopefully.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.069
How are you?

22:41.111 --> 22:42.570
How's...

22:42.612 --> 22:43.571
Flustered.
Flustered.

22:43.613 --> 22:45.198
Why, what's wrong?

22:45.240 --> 22:47.158
I've got too much stuff,
I don't know what's where.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.827
I can go and organize.

22:48.868 --> 22:49.869
I can put your vegetables
on one side.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.663
I'll handle that for you.

22:51.705 --> 22:53.498
And I'm so sorry about
the crew food, but, like...

22:53.540 --> 22:54.582
You're not even
at the starting line yet.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.167
No, I'm not.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.252
Right, so once we're there,
you'll do the food.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.878
Yeah.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.972
All crew, all crew,

23:09.014 --> 23:12.225
paninis available in the crew
canteen when you're ready.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.560
<i>Copy, thank you.</i>

23:13.601 --> 23:15.562
<i>Z, the wind is increasing.</i>

23:17.564 --> 23:18.690
<i>Copy that.</i>

23:18.732 --> 23:19.983
Oh sh--.

23:21.943 --> 23:24.112
There's butter everywhere.

23:24.154 --> 23:26.072
Okay, what's the time?

23:26.114 --> 23:28.950
12:33.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.201
Okay, can you come back at 2:00?

23:30.243 --> 23:32.120
Yeah, of course.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.664
Straight after lunch, we've got
a bachelor/bachelorette party.

23:34.706 --> 23:36.166
No worries.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.751
All my friends are,
like, getting married

23:37.792 --> 23:39.669
and, like, engaged, and dogs,

23:39.711 --> 23:41.963
and houses, and
I'm just here, like, mm.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.923
Cool.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.884
I'm quite happy to, like,
rock up to the wedding.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.720
You know, it's, like,
hopefully the skinny,

23:48.762 --> 23:52.307
tanned traveling girl,

23:52.349 --> 23:54.059
single and alone,

23:54.100 --> 23:55.727
just getting drunk
in the corner.

23:55.769 --> 23:56.978
There's, like, no room.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.190
[bleep]

24:00.231 --> 24:01.191
Here, I have butter knives.

24:01.232 --> 24:02.776
Thank you.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.069
I asked him,
he said dessert spoon.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.237
-In future, we'll relay.
-Okay.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.614
I just don't like it,
because they always

24:07.655 --> 24:08.907
use it for something else.

24:08.948 --> 24:09.991
I can just take it now.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.118
Yeah [bleep] it, we'll do it,

24:12.160 --> 24:13.286
because then otherwise
it's just less if they...

24:13.328 --> 24:14.788
Yeah.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.831
I don't think I'm like a
chief stew

24:16.873 --> 24:18.667
that's very particular
about a lot of things,

24:18.708 --> 24:20.210
but I think the way
tables are set...

24:25.090 --> 24:26.925
Ah!

24:26.966 --> 24:28.343
Every chief stew has a thing.

24:28.385 --> 24:29.636
I guess that's mine.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.806
Oh!

24:40.146 --> 24:42.732
So, I need a bowl for salad
and something for bread?

24:42.774 --> 24:43.817
Yeah.

24:43.858 --> 24:44.984
[bleep]

24:45.026 --> 24:46.277
I have to do...

24:46.319 --> 24:47.278
Oh, yeah.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.114
So, yeah, awesome sauce.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.990
Awesome sauce.

24:52.701 --> 24:54.035
He's on his own.

25:04.254 --> 25:06.256
So, were you at home
before coming over?

25:06.297 --> 25:07.340
Mm-hmm.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.177
North Wales.

25:20.854 --> 25:24.441
But at the same time,
I'm green, so...

25:30.280 --> 25:31.823
Anything I can get you up here?

25:31.865 --> 25:32.991
-We're good.
-Good here.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.034
Are we heading up for lunch?

25:34.075 --> 25:35.827
-Yeah.
-All right!

25:35.869 --> 25:37.203
All crew, all crew, I have
guests heading to the table.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.331
-Copy that.
-Copy.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.751
I never go in being, like,
"I'm gonna wow them."

25:42.792 --> 25:44.878
I just cook my heart out
and hope they love it.

25:47.047 --> 25:48.965
Local mussels,

25:49.007 --> 25:51.843
and then that's local chorizo
in a white wine tomato broth.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.053
Do you wanna come up and say it?

25:53.094 --> 25:54.095
-Sure.
-Or...

25:54.137 --> 25:55.180
I will,
if you want me to.

25:58.016 --> 26:00.101
The six Ps of yachting.

26:00.143 --> 26:01.102
Hello, everyone.

26:01.144 --> 26:02.771
Hello!

26:02.812 --> 26:04.356
-Hi, I'm sorry again.
-There's the man.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.149
And so, to start, those are
potato and feta roasties...

26:06.191 --> 26:07.484
Oh, nice.

26:07.525 --> 26:09.819
local mussels in
a white wine tomato broth...

26:09.861 --> 26:10.862
Yum!

26:10.904 --> 26:12.197
-Thank you, Mat.
-Thank you.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.074
Let's get popping.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.868
-Yum!
-Yum!

26:16.910 --> 26:18.119
-Salad's good.
-We love you, Mat.

26:18.161 --> 26:19.454
Happy you're here, Mat.

26:19.496 --> 26:20.455
You can come stay
in our cabin tonight.

26:20.497 --> 26:21.956
Wholly redeemed himself.

26:21.998 --> 26:22.957
-Yeah.
-He did.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.501
-Yum!
-Mm!

26:27.045 --> 26:28.046
Okay.

26:28.088 --> 26:29.339
You good?

26:29.381 --> 26:30.423
Yeah.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.801
Yeah, ish.

26:32.842 --> 26:33.802
Little hesitation there.

26:33.843 --> 26:34.803
-Ish.
-Ish?

26:34.844 --> 26:37.097
-Ish.
-Why?

26:37.138 --> 26:39.391
I think obviously just
the more I practice things,

26:39.432 --> 26:41.142
obviously the more naturally
it will come.

26:41.184 --> 26:42.435
Yeah.

26:47.524 --> 26:49.401
So, always think of the loop.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.111
Ah, and then that becomes...

26:52.070 --> 26:53.780
Yeah, hold the loop,

26:53.822 --> 26:56.241
and then control it with how
much line I have here.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.078
All right, Z, I'm gonna
leave you

27:00.120 --> 27:01.079
in charge of the swim platform.

27:01.121 --> 27:02.539
Okay.

27:02.580 --> 27:03.748
Will you just radio me if
any guests come down?

27:03.790 --> 27:04.749
Sure.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.793
Yeah, come play around, tinker.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.378
That was delicious,
but I'm gonna call it.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.838
I'm good.

27:09.879 --> 27:10.839
I could eat a hundred
more mussels.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.215
We've got dessert.

27:12.257 --> 27:14.259
Z, please keep an eye
on the jet ski line.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.385
<i>Copy that.</i>

27:17.846 --> 27:19.264
-Chef?
-Yes, darling?

27:19.305 --> 27:20.348
Could you help me deliver
these to the guests?

27:20.390 --> 27:21.766
I'd do anything for you.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.018
I just love you.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.227
-Do you really?
-I do.

27:24.269 --> 27:25.437
You always lie to the chef.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.230
Tell the chef you love them,

27:27.272 --> 27:28.940
because they'll always
serve you, like, spare food.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.483
You're a sweetheart.

27:30.525 --> 27:32.110
That's bad, I guess
that's leading people on,

27:32.152 --> 27:33.570
knowing it's gonna go nowhere.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.822
But, like, I'm a born flirter.

27:35.864 --> 27:37.574
Because you're flirting
with me and I'm bored,

27:37.615 --> 27:38.867
I have nothing else to do,
I'll flirt back.

27:38.908 --> 27:40.326
I actually told a guy that.

27:40.368 --> 27:42.078
He was, like,
"I accept that, that's fine."

27:42.120 --> 27:44.581
Like, seriously, most chefs
are ----ing assholes.

27:44.622 --> 27:46.207
I'll try to keep
it positive.

27:46.249 --> 27:47.876
Yeah.

27:50.628 --> 27:51.963
Yay!

27:52.005 --> 27:53.256
Delicious chocolate mousse
for you.

27:53.298 --> 27:57.093
-Whoa!
-Thank you!

27:57.135 --> 27:59.304
You're welcome, thank you.

27:59.346 --> 28:00.472
Mm!

28:00.513 --> 28:01.890
Everything was on point.

28:01.931 --> 28:03.475
Look what
a beautiful day it is!

28:03.516 --> 28:05.060
Woo!

28:12.984 --> 28:14.194
Sh--.

28:14.235 --> 28:15.445
And then tomorrow's
the wedding.

28:15.487 --> 28:16.446
Nice lunch?

28:16.488 --> 28:19.157
-We did.
-Cool.

28:19.199 --> 28:20.533
Did they like their lunch?

28:20.575 --> 28:21.618
Yeah, no, they were really,
really happy.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.119
Oh, yay!

28:23.161 --> 28:24.162
And they said compliments
to the chef.

28:24.204 --> 28:25.330
Oh, awesome, awesome.

28:25.372 --> 28:26.581
All good vibes.

28:26.623 --> 28:28.333
-All right, thank you.
-Keep it there.

28:28.375 --> 28:29.334
All right!

28:29.376 --> 28:30.335
Just make it fun.

28:30.377 --> 28:31.920
Yeah.

28:31.961 --> 28:33.296
Bullsh-- with them,
get them drunk, happy.

28:33.338 --> 28:34.422
Bachelor party, yeah.

28:34.464 --> 28:35.423
I'll do me best.

28:35.465 --> 28:37.050
I have faith.

28:37.092 --> 28:38.426
All right, boys,
let's go catch dinner.

28:38.468 --> 28:40.095
Gentlemen, let's get
you loaded up.

28:40.136 --> 28:41.096
Get some fish!

28:41.137 --> 28:42.430
Hey...

28:42.472 --> 28:45.350
hey, is that jet ski
tied onto something?

28:45.392 --> 28:47.185
I don't think it is.

28:47.227 --> 28:48.978
-Ugh!
-I think it's floating away.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.522
Get a life jacket on,
let's go grab that jet ski.

28:50.563 --> 28:53.066
Oh [bleep].

28:55.068 --> 28:56.361
Get on with Lloyd, please.

28:58.029 --> 28:59.447
Coming up...

28:59.489 --> 29:02.158
I keep forgetting
we have a wedding, still.

29:11.751 --> 29:11.960
Ugh.

29:13.962 --> 29:16.339
Get a lifejacket on, please,
let's go grab that jet ski.

29:22.512 --> 29:25.098
Get on with Lloyd please.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.474
Just another day in paradise.

29:26.516 --> 29:27.976
I looked out there,
and I was like, dude,

29:28.018 --> 29:29.477
that looks a little far.

29:36.735 --> 29:39.946
All right, your stern's clear.

29:39.988 --> 29:41.281
Bridge, bridge,
that is tender away.

29:41.322 --> 29:43.074
-Copy.
-Woo!

29:43.116 --> 29:45.285
For the bachelorette party,
we have guests heading down

29:45.326 --> 29:47.078
to the swim platform
to use the unicorn.

29:48.538 --> 29:50.290
That's okay.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.083
I'm gonna let him off the hook
just this first time,

29:52.125 --> 29:55.086
because I've also tied
a line wrong

29:55.128 --> 29:57.172
and watched
the jet ski float away,

29:57.213 --> 30:00.258
so I think it's like
a rite of passage on deck.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.385
Oh, my God, this is so cute!

30:02.427 --> 30:04.637
We named her Maureen.

30:04.679 --> 30:06.306
It's a bachelor party!

30:06.348 --> 30:09.142
My last night!

30:09.184 --> 30:11.311
Yeah.

30:11.353 --> 30:12.437
Just down that little dirt path.

30:12.479 --> 30:13.646
Wow, dude, look
at this water.

30:13.688 --> 30:15.565
-It's beautiful.
-Yes!

30:15.607 --> 30:19.194
-That is a bachelorette...
-That's a party.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.570
You ladies like any snacks
or anything like that?

30:22.197 --> 30:24.282
That's a good snack.

30:24.324 --> 30:25.784
Clint, you excited
about tomorrow?

30:25.825 --> 30:27.160
-Hell, yeah, brother.
-Big day!

30:27.202 --> 30:28.703
My life is officially over.

30:30.538 --> 30:31.748
Bottle of vodka.

30:31.790 --> 30:34.751
-Yay, thank you.
-Pleasure.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.461
Having a hospitality background,

30:36.503 --> 30:38.672
I am very comfortable,
especially if people are drunk.

30:38.713 --> 30:40.674
You see them in
restaurants every day.

30:40.715 --> 30:42.300
So, probably the first thing

30:42.342 --> 30:43.677
that I'm feeling
super confident with.

30:43.718 --> 30:45.679
Nice job, Z.
Go take a break!

30:45.720 --> 30:46.721
Thank you.

30:48.181 --> 30:49.557
It's so beautiful here.

30:52.227 --> 30:53.395
I know, right?

31:02.654 --> 31:05.824
But seriously, they honestly say
that that would be gold-digging.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.492
So, should I just date a bum?

31:07.534 --> 31:09.703
I used to date, like,
for love and all that sh--

31:09.744 --> 31:11.705
but love don't pay
the ----ing bills.

31:11.746 --> 31:12.706
So dumb.

31:12.747 --> 31:14.290
I feel ya, bro.

31:14.332 --> 31:15.500
Have you seen any
[bleep]s swimming around?

31:15.542 --> 31:16.501
-No.
-I haven't, either.

31:16.543 --> 31:18.503
Ooh.

31:18.545 --> 31:19.796
-Let me see.
-Hey!

31:19.838 --> 31:20.797
A sea cucumber!

31:20.839 --> 31:22.549
-Oh!
-Sick.

31:22.590 --> 31:23.591
Weird.

31:29.681 --> 31:31.349
<i>Malia, Malia, Dave,</i>
<i>just a request.</i>

31:31.391 --> 31:32.726
Has the chef got a fish,

31:32.767 --> 31:34.519
so the boys can have
a picture with a fish?

31:38.773 --> 31:40.400
<i>Copy, tender returning.</i>

31:40.442 --> 31:41.401
Can I just leave this
with you guys,

31:41.443 --> 31:42.444
can you bring it back to me?

31:42.485 --> 31:44.612
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

31:44.654 --> 31:45.822
-Yes!
-Yeah!

31:45.864 --> 31:48.533
Woo!

31:48.575 --> 31:50.118
-Okay, boys.
-Great, thank you.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.619
Thank you very much!
Man, that was fun.

31:51.661 --> 31:53.163
Do you want
a photo with your fish?

31:53.204 --> 31:54.789
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-Cool.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.583
-Yeah!
-Woo!

31:56.624 --> 31:57.834
That was fun,
it was a great experience.

31:57.876 --> 31:59.419
Yeah, now that's a catch.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.212
I actually quite like
walking on these things.

32:01.254 --> 32:02.881
It's like being in a
play park when you were a kid,

32:02.922 --> 32:05.425
but even better,
when you're an adult!

32:05.467 --> 32:07.385
Oh, did they actually catch it?

32:07.427 --> 32:08.428
No.

32:08.470 --> 32:09.512
Oh, I was, like...

32:09.554 --> 32:11.723
Yeah, it came gutted and scaled.

32:11.765 --> 32:15.393
Babe, are you ready
to say your "I dos" tomorrow?

32:15.435 --> 32:17.604
I am. I am.

32:17.645 --> 32:18.813
So excited.

32:18.855 --> 32:20.106
Okay, clear to come up?

32:20.148 --> 32:21.107
Yeah.

32:21.149 --> 32:23.318
Coming up.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.611
Lloyd, wanna drive it?

32:24.652 --> 32:26.404
-Yeah, sweet.
-I'll do the cable.

32:27.906 --> 32:29.366
Looking good.

32:29.407 --> 32:31.451
All crew, all crew,
dinner's ready.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.161
-Thank you for that.
-You're welcome.

32:33.203 --> 32:34.496
Oh, I'll fix your collar.

32:34.537 --> 32:35.705
Thank you.

32:35.747 --> 32:36.790
-You like it like...
-Pop my collar?

32:36.831 --> 32:38.458
Yeah.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.459
Only when I'm trying
to impress the ladies.

32:39.501 --> 32:40.794
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:40.835 --> 32:42.837
So, yeah, so when
we're on charter,

32:42.879 --> 32:44.881
it's lunch and dinner
for the crew, okay?

32:44.923 --> 32:46.466
Copy, yeah.

32:46.508 --> 32:47.467
Because they're working
really hard, and...

32:47.509 --> 32:49.260
Yep, all right.

32:49.302 --> 32:50.512
-Thank you so much, sandy.
-Okay, you're welcome.

32:50.553 --> 32:51.513
I appreciate how
understanding you are.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.181
No worries.

32:53.223 --> 32:54.474
I knew Mathew would come
around to making crew food,

32:54.516 --> 32:56.476
and I just had
to play my cards right.

32:56.518 --> 32:58.937
I just had to take it
one step at a time,

32:58.978 --> 33:01.231
and let him settle back in.

33:01.272 --> 33:02.857
Hi, welcome back.

33:04.693 --> 33:06.361
I can't hear anything.

33:23.420 --> 33:24.421
Here, I'll sit here.

33:24.462 --> 33:26.256
Yeah, we're good.

33:26.297 --> 33:27.257
They're all main deck aft.

33:27.298 --> 33:28.258
Did you check on them just now?

33:28.299 --> 33:29.801
Yeah.

33:29.843 --> 33:31.761
-I'll keep an eye on them.
-I appreciate it a lot.

33:31.803 --> 33:33.763
Do you want a cup of tea?
Makes everything better.

33:33.805 --> 33:35.181
Is there any Earl Grey?

33:35.223 --> 33:36.349
There is Earl Grey.

33:36.391 --> 33:37.517
-Go on, darling.
-Oh!

33:37.559 --> 33:39.436
Okay, I'm gonna go get changed.

33:39.477 --> 33:41.730
Katie is lovely, but I don't
get to speak to her that much.

33:41.771 --> 33:43.898
She's also chief stew,
so she's scary.

33:50.238 --> 33:51.489
Can you get two?

33:51.531 --> 33:53.199
[bleep] you, Dave,
I'm not weak!

33:53.241 --> 33:54.242
It is quite difficult,
especially when you've got

33:54.284 --> 33:56.786
short T. Rex arms.

33:56.828 --> 33:58.663
Do you think I should
put it underneath?

33:58.705 --> 34:00.290
Yeah, I like it,
and then make sure

34:00.331 --> 34:02.292
they're always in
the middle of the chair.

34:02.334 --> 34:03.877
So, it's nice and even.

34:03.918 --> 34:06.880
My last boat, I still had,
like, seven girls under me,

34:06.921 --> 34:08.548
but you could always use more.

34:08.590 --> 34:10.717
The bigger size you get,

34:10.759 --> 34:12.969
slightly less hands-on
the chief stew is,

34:13.011 --> 34:14.804
because there's
so much more admin.

34:14.846 --> 34:16.639
But hey, I'm not afraid
to get my hands dirty.

34:16.681 --> 34:18.433
I still like it,
it's a challenge.

34:18.475 --> 34:19.976
And I've got my third stew

34:20.018 --> 34:23.021
and I've got a chef back,
so let's do this.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.775
-Not bad.
-You're vibing?

34:26.816 --> 34:28.443
The vibe is the vibe.

34:28.485 --> 34:29.778
Vibe check.

34:31.613 --> 34:33.281
Okay, see you in the morning.

34:33.323 --> 34:34.824
I'll see you in the morning.

34:34.866 --> 34:36.868
-Get you tied up.
-Tie me, baby.

34:38.328 --> 34:39.412
Beautiful, baby.

34:39.454 --> 34:40.622
Let's do it.

34:40.663 --> 34:42.457
Ooh, it's raining.

34:44.459 --> 34:45.794
There we go.

34:47.962 --> 34:49.422
[thunder]

34:50.465 --> 34:52.258
Oh!

34:52.300 --> 34:53.677
Y'all need to cover
these cushions?

34:56.638 --> 34:57.847
Mother----er.

34:57.889 --> 34:59.933
Cushions.

34:59.974 --> 35:01.434
Deck crew, deck crew,
I don't know if you know,

35:01.476 --> 35:02.686
but it's pissing down
with rain.

35:03.770 --> 35:05.355
Copy.
Z, can you gimme a hand?

35:05.397 --> 35:07.607
Is your seat wet?

35:07.649 --> 35:08.858
The other guy
should be helping.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.360
Ah, ah, ah!

35:14.656 --> 35:16.783
Oh [bleep]!

35:16.825 --> 35:18.451
Galley, galley, we're good
to go when you are.

35:18.493 --> 35:19.577
Roger dodger, 10-4.

35:19.619 --> 35:21.371
Going into the first dinner,

35:21.413 --> 35:25.083
I just wanna redeem myself
and not overcomplicate things.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.918
So, I know I can do this,

35:26.960 --> 35:28.712
but I need to prove
to the guests

35:28.753 --> 35:30.797
and the captain and the crew
that I can do this.

35:30.839 --> 35:32.632
We're gonna synchronize
the service.

35:32.674 --> 35:34.551
Me and you will both take three,
and you'll take two.

35:34.592 --> 35:35.802
Yeah.

35:35.844 --> 35:37.637
I will plate the three
on this side.

35:37.679 --> 35:39.597
By the time she gets
to her...

35:39.639 --> 35:41.725
To her end, we'll already...

35:41.766 --> 35:43.059
Okay.

35:43.101 --> 35:45.020
Synchronization is
so ----ing important.

35:45.061 --> 35:47.731
I don't know why people bring
out dishes two at a time.

35:47.772 --> 35:50.358
Like, on a superyacht, you
should have the best service.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.068
That's what guests like,
they like a show.

35:52.110 --> 35:54.612
And also, I just think
it looks good.

35:54.654 --> 35:55.697
I love truffle pasta!

35:55.739 --> 35:56.990
I'm here to impress you.

35:57.032 --> 35:58.116
The water was not cold.

35:58.158 --> 35:59.868
No, it's the air temp.

35:59.909 --> 36:01.536
It's when you get outta
the water that it's cold.

36:03.371 --> 36:04.789
Darling, you look so gorgeous.

36:04.831 --> 36:06.332
Woo-ooh!

36:06.374 --> 36:08.460
For your starter tonight,
truffle pasta.

36:08.501 --> 36:10.086
-Yeah!
-Woo!

36:10.128 --> 36:11.963
It smells so good.

36:12.005 --> 36:13.381
I will eat the rest of this.

36:13.423 --> 36:14.591
Oh, my gosh, that was amazing.

36:14.632 --> 36:16.926
-Awesome.
-Mm!

36:16.968 --> 36:18.553
This is my favorite thing
I've eaten all week.

36:22.057 --> 36:23.350
And then go into the laundry.

36:23.391 --> 36:24.601
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, cool.

36:24.642 --> 36:26.061
How's your knee feeling today?

36:26.102 --> 36:27.354
-Sore, but, like...
-Yeah.

36:27.395 --> 36:28.688
It's mostly on stairs.

36:28.730 --> 36:29.689
But you can, like,
put weight on it?

36:29.731 --> 36:31.149
Yeah, yeah.

36:31.191 --> 36:34.152
Well, I am pretty skeptical
of chefs nowadays.

36:34.194 --> 36:37.989
I think the extent
to which he's physically hurt...

36:38.031 --> 36:39.699
not so much.

36:39.741 --> 36:40.700
I thought
we were gonna lose you there.

36:40.742 --> 36:41.993
Oh, my God.

36:42.035 --> 36:43.411
We're gonna synchronize
the service.

36:43.453 --> 36:44.662
Mat throws it down.

36:44.704 --> 36:46.956
Mat's the sh--.

36:46.998 --> 36:48.083
Loving the pasta.

36:48.124 --> 36:50.543
Oh, my gosh, mission accomp...

36:50.585 --> 36:52.003
well... I don't wanna
speak too soon;

36:52.045 --> 36:53.713
we got two more courses to go.

36:58.593 --> 37:00.845
Woop!
Oh, my God.

37:00.887 --> 37:01.846
Whoa!

37:01.888 --> 37:03.098
Getting a little windy out here.

37:03.139 --> 37:04.933
There's a little blanket
right there.

37:04.974 --> 37:05.934
I'll get us a blanket,
or I'll get you something.

37:05.975 --> 37:07.060
It's ----ing chilly.

37:10.063 --> 37:11.731
-Freezing.
-I don't wanna do this.

37:11.773 --> 37:12.941
-Ah!
-Oh-oh!

37:12.982 --> 37:14.734
-Getting nasty.
-Let's go inside.

37:14.776 --> 37:17.195
Galley, you need to stand by, we
have to move everything inside.

37:17.237 --> 37:19.197
Girls, can I have
a hand up here?

37:19.239 --> 37:20.532
Let's go, babe, come on.

37:22.617 --> 37:23.910
Yo, Lex, can we bring these?

37:23.952 --> 37:25.662
No, we can't,
they're not seated yet.

37:25.704 --> 37:28.748
-Three minutes.
-Three minutes?

37:28.790 --> 37:31.668
I tried so ----ing hard to
make everything perfect today,

37:31.710 --> 37:34.004
and my whole dinner service
could be ----ed.

37:34.045 --> 37:35.755
The more obstacles, the better.

37:35.797 --> 37:38.091
I can't wait to see
how Mat cooks it up.

37:44.305 --> 37:45.098
<i>Galley, you need to stand by,</i>

37:46.683 --> 37:47.684
<i>we have to move</i>
<i>everything inside.</i>

37:49.227 --> 37:51.146
All right, this needs
to go while it's hot.

37:51.187 --> 37:53.565
Go to your spot,
babe, babe, babe...

37:53.606 --> 37:55.191
<i>Courtney, Courtney,</i>
<i>are you downstairs?</i>

37:55.233 --> 37:57.277
Just setting out the placemats.

37:57.318 --> 37:58.820
Okay, I'll help her downstairs.

37:58.862 --> 38:00.280
The universe started
----ing with us

38:00.321 --> 38:01.948
from day one on this trip.

38:01.990 --> 38:04.534
Not having a chef, these
guests are drinking like...

38:04.576 --> 38:06.786
The weather is a ----ing
sh--show,

38:06.828 --> 38:10.165
and it's like, oh, how much
more [bleep]s can I give?

38:10.206 --> 38:11.666
How much longer till the food?

38:11.708 --> 38:13.084
I don't know.

38:13.126 --> 38:14.711
It's gonna be cold.

38:14.753 --> 38:15.712
Okay, two seconds.
Can I get that way, please?

38:15.754 --> 38:17.005
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.

38:17.047 --> 38:18.006
Who doesn't have a drink
at the moment?

38:18.048 --> 38:19.549
May I have red wine?

38:19.591 --> 38:20.800
Either one of these
with the grapefruit?

38:20.842 --> 38:22.010
-Yep.
-Same thing, yeah, for her.

38:22.052 --> 38:23.011
I'll do another
red wine, please.

38:23.053 --> 38:24.220
Yep.

38:24.262 --> 38:26.723
Can I do it...
can I do the food?

38:26.765 --> 38:27.724
Do you wanna go present to them?

38:27.766 --> 38:28.767
Can we close the door?

38:28.808 --> 38:31.644
I need the red wine.

38:31.686 --> 38:33.188
-Hey, here we go!
-Yay!

38:33.229 --> 38:35.273
All right, so this is
just extra for the table.

38:35.315 --> 38:36.941
We're gonna bring
you out plates.

38:36.983 --> 38:37.942
Yeah, wow!

38:37.984 --> 38:38.943
That's a local bass.

38:38.985 --> 38:40.153
That looks amazing.

38:40.195 --> 38:41.696
-What do we do with that?
-What?

38:41.738 --> 38:42.906
What she said.

38:42.947 --> 38:45.241
All right, help me bring
in these plates.

38:45.283 --> 38:46.326
Serve from the left,
serve from the right.

38:46.368 --> 38:47.702
Okay, right.

38:47.744 --> 38:49.204
Pardon me!

38:49.245 --> 38:51.206
-Oh, oh, oh.
-Thank you.

38:51.247 --> 38:53.166
Can we get a little
explanation on this, Mat?

38:53.208 --> 38:54.959
Badass whole fish.

38:55.001 --> 38:58.046
A whole roasted local bass with
tomato, white wine, caper sauce.

38:58.088 --> 39:00.215
-Oh!
-Wonderful.

39:00.256 --> 39:01.591
Yeah, he's a G.

39:01.633 --> 39:02.592
-Mm!
-Yum!

39:02.634 --> 39:03.677
Wow.

39:03.718 --> 39:04.803
That's what's up.

39:10.642 --> 39:11.810
-Please.
-Cool.

39:11.851 --> 39:13.144
[whistling]

39:18.066 --> 39:19.025
Hey, hey.

39:19.067 --> 39:21.027
Going good?

39:21.069 --> 39:22.362
Yeah, I'm just going around to
make sure everything's cool.

39:22.404 --> 39:23.863
-Nice.
-Nice job.

39:23.905 --> 39:24.864
Yeah.

39:24.906 --> 39:26.199
Look at that...

39:26.241 --> 39:27.617
I see the second stripe
already showing up.

39:30.412 --> 39:32.622
Cheers to Karry and Clint,

39:32.664 --> 39:34.040
they're getting married
tomorrow!

39:34.082 --> 39:36.835
-Yay!
-Woo!

39:36.876 --> 39:38.753
Oh, yeah, vanilla crème brûlée.

39:38.795 --> 39:40.255
-Are we good?
-Yeah, good.

39:40.296 --> 39:41.840
What?

39:41.881 --> 39:42.924
I don't know,
I'm just looking at you.

39:42.966 --> 39:44.801
You're hot.

39:44.843 --> 39:47.095
I'm looking at this hot outfit
that you need to show off.

39:54.144 --> 39:55.603
They should be, because
I've been making drinks

39:55.645 --> 39:57.731
since they got up at
8:30 this morning.

39:57.772 --> 39:58.898
-No way.
-I'm not joking.

39:58.940 --> 40:00.650
Hello?

40:03.445 --> 40:04.654
Mm.

40:07.282 --> 40:09.868
Oh!

40:09.909 --> 40:11.286
I'm ready to dance party.

40:11.327 --> 40:13.163
Karry is not making
a dance party tonight.

40:14.831 --> 40:17.167
We're not partying late tonight.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.835
Oh, yes!

40:18.877 --> 40:20.128
-Huh.
-Woo!

40:20.170 --> 40:22.130
Crème brûlée!

40:22.172 --> 40:23.798
Yeah, that's what
we like to hear.

40:23.840 --> 40:24.841
Yes!

40:24.883 --> 40:26.051
That's been torched.

40:26.092 --> 40:28.303
Woo!

40:28.345 --> 40:30.847
Wow, Mat is on point
with his dessert.

40:30.889 --> 40:32.807
-Yum, yum.
-Oh, so good.

40:32.849 --> 40:34.309
Mat.

40:34.351 --> 40:36.686
Yeah, you're pretty efficient.

40:36.728 --> 40:38.688
I thought it was gonna be
a disaster in here.

40:38.730 --> 40:40.315
Based on yesterday,

40:40.357 --> 40:43.276
I'm sure you didn't have
too high expectations.

40:43.318 --> 40:45.403
Last night was horrible.

40:45.445 --> 40:48.865
Well, one was cooked by a chef;
the other one wasn't.

40:50.325 --> 40:51.368
They really love your food,
which is good.

40:51.409 --> 40:53.036
So good.

40:53.078 --> 40:54.829
I'm glad, I'm grateful
that he came back.

40:54.871 --> 40:57.082
I think he thinks he's a hero,

40:57.123 --> 40:59.668
and really, he isn't, because
he screwed the first day over.

40:59.709 --> 41:02.253
You're, like, signed up
to cook, you know?

41:02.295 --> 41:04.839
Why should you get a pat
on the back for cooking?

41:04.881 --> 41:06.341
Best crème brûlée I've ever had.

41:06.383 --> 41:07.425
That was amazing.

41:07.467 --> 41:08.760
Thank you so much for today.

41:08.802 --> 41:10.011
Yeah, thank you.

41:10.053 --> 41:11.680
That's you down, sir.

41:11.721 --> 41:12.722
-Thank you.
-Good job.

41:12.764 --> 41:13.723
You'll be on deck at 6:00.

41:13.765 --> 41:15.350
Good night.

41:15.392 --> 41:16.685
How's it going?

41:16.726 --> 41:18.311
Good, how are you?

41:18.353 --> 41:19.479
Oh, so good.

41:32.367 --> 41:33.910
Yeah, then come back.

41:33.952 --> 41:35.829
Maybe I'll quit when we
have, like, provisions,

41:35.870 --> 41:36.830
and then I'll come back after.

41:36.871 --> 41:38.498
Yeah, for sure.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.250
Sorry, guys, I'm not gonna
party with y'all late.

41:40.291 --> 41:41.793
Yeah, tomorrow's the wedding.

41:41.835 --> 41:43.378
Do y'all wanna get up?

41:43.420 --> 41:46.339
Excuse me from this dinner.

41:46.381 --> 41:48.174
See, this is
a perfect early night.

41:48.216 --> 41:49.884
It's raining.

41:49.926 --> 41:51.886
We can clear everything.

41:51.928 --> 41:53.346
They're all gone.

41:55.515 --> 41:57.058
Has Karry gone to bed?

41:57.100 --> 41:58.435
I don't know.

41:58.476 --> 42:00.353
I think she...
I think... yeah.

42:00.395 --> 42:01.396
Yeah.

42:01.438 --> 42:02.814
I don't really wanna go to bed.

42:02.856 --> 42:04.399
I'm sorry, but I'm exhausted.

42:04.441 --> 42:06.109
Tomorrow's my big day.

42:06.151 --> 42:07.277
I know.

42:07.318 --> 42:08.903
Tomorrow's gonna be ----ed.

42:08.945 --> 42:10.905
I keep forgetting they
have a wedding, still.

42:10.947 --> 42:12.449
How's outside?

42:12.490 --> 42:14.075
Everything's covered except
for the dining area.

42:14.117 --> 42:15.285
What are you looking for, babe?

42:15.326 --> 42:17.162
Your charger.

42:17.203 --> 42:19.122
You're gonna want your phone
charged tomorrow, trust me.

42:19.164 --> 42:20.123
Oh, I hear voices.

42:20.165 --> 42:21.916
No.

42:21.958 --> 42:23.168
Oh, my God.

42:23.209 --> 42:24.836
Well, I mean,
we need it for yourself.

42:24.878 --> 42:25.837
You haven't had a charger
the whole time.

42:25.879 --> 42:27.797
This is my phone charger.

42:27.839 --> 42:29.424
No, it's not, babe, yours is
the big block, that's mine.

42:29.466 --> 42:31.009
Who cares?
It's a ----ing charger.

42:31.051 --> 42:32.093
Don't ----ing get attitude
with me.

42:32.135 --> 42:34.346
I can't wait to marry you.

42:36.931 --> 42:38.141
Chill the [bleep] out.

42:38.183 --> 42:39.851
You are drunk as sh--.
Look at you.

42:41.186 --> 42:42.896
Good, do it.

42:45.440 --> 42:46.816
-"Just let us know."
-"let us know."

42:46.858 --> 42:48.818
Kar, you're so drunk.

42:50.403 --> 42:53.198
----ing call me a douchebag
one more time, Karry.

42:53.239 --> 42:54.532
Call me a douchebag one
more ----ing time.

42:56.159 --> 42:58.036
Yeah, I don't give a [bleep].

42:58.078 --> 43:00.413
Good, I don't wanna marry you.

43:00.455 --> 43:01.831
I'm done.
I'm not marrying you.

43:01.873 --> 43:03.333
I'm going
to tell them right now.

43:11.925 --> 43:13.385
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:17.639 --> 43:19.224
It's a weird vibe.

43:19.265 --> 43:21.309
Interior, interior,
you're gonna feel it.

43:21.351 --> 43:22.977
Holy sh--.

43:23.019 --> 43:24.062
Woo!

43:24.104 --> 43:25.438
Oh [bleep].

43:25.480 --> 43:26.481
There's some ----ing waves
right here.

43:26.523 --> 43:27.482
[bleep]

43:27.524 --> 43:29.192
Happy first day.

43:32.487 --> 43:36.199
It's definitely a new dynamic,
being attracted to my boss.

43:36.241 --> 43:37.992
We're living and working
with people

43:38.034 --> 43:40.453
who we wouldn't even speak
to in normal circumstance.

43:40.495 --> 43:42.330
You wouldn't speak to me
in normal circumstance?

43:42.372 --> 43:43.873
You wouldn't speak to me.

43:43.915 --> 43:45.375
Water glass always goes
on top of main knife.

43:45.417 --> 43:47.085
It's supposed to be
on the side at an angle.

43:47.127 --> 43:48.962
Main.

43:49.004 --> 43:51.506
Just do it how I set it, and
let's move on to the next task.

43:51.548 --> 43:52.966
This is the best meat
I've ever had.

43:53.925 --> 43:55.260
some more lamb.

43:55.301 --> 43:57.095
Yo, you're stepping right
in my piles.

43:57.137 --> 43:58.430
Don't worry about
the ----ing dirt.

43:58.471 --> 44:00.640
Now is not the time.

44:00.682 --> 44:02.934
Okay, neat freak...
I get it.

44:02.976 --> 44:04.894
Focus on putting the lamb
on the plate.

44:04.936 --> 44:08.982
You don't touch anything until
you're sure the guests are done.

44:09.024 --> 44:10.358
You can't talk to me
like you're the boss.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.401
I'm in charge of the galley,
all right?

44:11.443 --> 44:12.485
I know, but I'm saying...

44:12.527 --> 44:13.528
Never again.
Never again.

44:13.570 --> 44:14.571
Get out.
