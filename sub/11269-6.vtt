WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:04.119
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.120 --> 00:06.721
This is the third time we've
been here in two weeks, Sam.

00:06.721 --> 00:08.573
Any idea why you're having
so many fights?

00:08.574 --> 00:11.426
Yeah, yeah, ever since that
biker bar closed down,

00:11.427 --> 00:13.061
we're getting these
big apes coming in here.

00:13.062 --> 00:14.379
I mean, what are
we supposed to do?

00:14.380 --> 00:16.062
Be grateful.

00:18.667 --> 00:19.801
You know something,

00:19.802 --> 00:21.636
if you'd get over here
when I called you,

00:21.637 --> 00:24.005
none of this would've happened.

00:24.039 --> 00:25.740
Oh, oh, look at this.

00:25.741 --> 00:27.441
Woody. Oh, man,
are you all right?

00:27.442 --> 00:28.843
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:28.844 --> 00:30.980
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

00:30.981 --> 00:33.014
We're gonna have to
file an injury report.

00:33.015 --> 00:35.267
You bet you are.
Tell him, tell him what happened.

00:35.268 --> 00:37.735
Well, I was downstairs
getting a case of scotch,

00:37.736 --> 00:39.971
and there's that
one low beam...

00:40.022 --> 00:42.541

01:29.305 --> 01:33.574
Can you believe this guy winning
12 million bucks in the lottery?

01:33.609 --> 01:36.344
I... I mean, talk about
beating the odds.

01:36.345 --> 01:38.647
Oh, yeah, you want to talk about
beating the odds,

01:38.648 --> 01:41.583
my Uncle Spence fell 20,000 feet
from an airplane

01:41.617 --> 01:43.667
and hit the only pile of hay
for two miles.

01:43.686 --> 01:44.819
Jeez.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.955
He must be the luckiest
man on earth.

01:46.956 --> 01:47.989
Well, not really.

01:47.990 --> 01:50.058
He went through
the propeller first.

01:54.664 --> 01:57.715
There's the scariest human being
I've ever seen in my life.

01:57.750 --> 01:58.983
Hmph. Boy. Yeah.

01:59.017 --> 02:02.754
Remind me to congratulate
the doctor who created him.

02:02.788 --> 02:04.022
You Sam?

02:04.023 --> 02:05.140
Yeah, that's me.
Are you Tiny?

02:05.141 --> 02:06.508
I'll be right with you.

02:06.509 --> 02:08.043
Uh, Sam, you ought
to think about

02:08.044 --> 02:09.810
wearing those reading
glasses all the time.

02:09.811 --> 02:11.513
That guy's huge.

02:11.547 --> 02:13.348
(chains jingling)

02:13.382 --> 02:14.583
No, no, no, no.

02:14.617 --> 02:16.351
That's his name.
Tiny's his name.

02:16.385 --> 02:18.553
He was the bouncer
at that biker bar.

02:18.554 --> 02:20.655
I figure if we're gonna
have that crowd in here,

02:20.656 --> 02:22.658
I might as well
have him around. What do you think?

02:22.659 --> 02:23.774
Oh, please, Sam.

02:23.809 --> 02:26.411
If I promise to feed
him, can I keep him?

02:26.479 --> 02:27.978
Yeah, I'll ask him.

02:27.979 --> 02:30.247
Hey, Tiny, why don't you
fill out this application

02:30.248 --> 02:32.117
so I can start checking
your references.

02:32.118 --> 02:33.067
That's nuts.

02:33.068 --> 02:34.235
Sam's wasting his money.

02:34.236 --> 02:36.304
I could have done that job.

02:36.338 --> 02:38.773
Sure, I'm taking karate
down at the YW...

02:38.807 --> 02:40.775
The "Y."

02:40.809 --> 02:43.844
(chains jingling)

02:43.845 --> 02:45.213
So, Tiny, huh?
(chuckles)

02:45.214 --> 02:47.215
That's a pretty funny nickname
given,

02:47.216 --> 02:48.416
you know, how big you are.

02:48.417 --> 02:49.483
Why?

02:49.518 --> 02:51.252
You making fun of my name?

02:51.287 --> 02:53.288
You think I got a joke name?

02:53.290 --> 02:56.441
Do you think I'm
some kind of joke?

02:56.443 --> 02:58.560
Tell Vera I loved her.

02:58.561 --> 02:59.961
Hey, wait, ho!
Excuse me here.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.429
Tiny there, my main man.

03:01.464 --> 03:03.398
Hey, uh, step into my office.

03:03.432 --> 03:05.032
I'll take care of this, Normie.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.734
You see, Tiny, uh,

03:06.735 --> 03:09.837
you know, calling you "tiny,"
a guy of your, you know, girth,

03:09.838 --> 03:13.341
uh, is what we in
the comedy profession call a juxtaposition.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.428
Right?
Yeah. Juxtaposition.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.062
See, it's, uh,

03:18.164 --> 03:21.115
calling a... calling a...
a bald guy "Curly."

03:21.150 --> 03:22.750
Fat guy "Slim."

03:22.752 --> 03:25.386
Tall guy... "Shorty."

03:27.256 --> 03:28.823
I like that.
You're smart.

03:28.874 --> 03:30.692
Why, thank you.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.477
No, that's your new nickname.

03:32.511 --> 03:34.245
Get it?
I made a joke.

03:36.182 --> 03:38.883
And a fine joke it is, too, sir.

03:41.354 --> 03:42.620
Hey, guys.

03:42.621 --> 03:44.422
Now I know you sent me out
for snack food,

03:44.423 --> 03:46.558
but I found this place called
The Healthy Alternative.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.311
Now they have all your favourite
munchies, only organic,

03:49.312 --> 03:51.663
with tofu and soy
and that sort of thing.

03:51.781 --> 03:55.449
So I drove right past it,
went to the grocery store,

03:55.450 --> 03:57.152
and got you a big box
of Fiddle Faddle.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.802
Hey.

04:01.624 --> 04:04.859
Lilith, I'm so jealous of you.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.294
Excuse me?

04:06.329 --> 04:08.396
Yeah, I-I saw you outside.

04:08.397 --> 04:09.798
After seven years of marriage,

04:09.799 --> 04:12.100
how do you guys keep
your relationship so hot?

04:12.101 --> 04:13.685
I don't know what you mean.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.654
Outside, I saw you in the car.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.488
You were all over him.

04:18.523 --> 04:20.156
Come on, it was great.

04:20.192 --> 04:23.394
You were steaming up the windows
like a couple of teenagers.

04:23.395 --> 04:25.163
Well, I've just won
five games in a row.

04:25.164 --> 04:26.544
When you're hot, you're hot.

04:27.984 --> 04:29.667
Oh, hi, Buttercup.

04:29.735 --> 04:30.918
Now that's odd.

04:30.952 --> 04:32.822
He's here and I just
saw the two of you

04:32.905 --> 04:34.322
out in the...
Oh, my God.

04:36.242 --> 04:37.709
What's the matter?

04:37.710 --> 04:38.926
Uh, nothing.
Rebecca and I

04:38.927 --> 04:40.495
just have to have
a little talk in the office.

04:40.496 --> 04:42.163
It's private.
Oh, my God!

04:42.164 --> 04:43.598
Anything I can help you with?

04:43.599 --> 04:45.567
No, I can handle it ably
on my own.

04:45.618 --> 04:46.998
Well, I'm here if you need me.

04:48.004 --> 04:49.838
Lilith, I don't
want to hear this.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.439
Calm down, Rebecca.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.942
I've got enough to deal with
without you going berserk on me.

04:53.943 --> 04:55.509
Yes, that was me
you saw in the car,

04:55.510 --> 04:57.746
and, obviously, the man
with me was not Frasier.

04:57.747 --> 04:59.330
Lilith, you are
having an affair!

04:59.331 --> 05:00.381
It isn't an affair.

05:00.398 --> 05:01.933
It was a one-time fling.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.468
I've been working side by side
with this man for months,

05:04.469 --> 05:06.171
and I'm afraid
our latent desires

05:06.172 --> 05:07.705
just got the better of us.

05:07.773 --> 05:08.989
It's the old story.

05:08.990 --> 05:10.725
One moment we were
feeding the lab rats

05:10.726 --> 05:14.995
and the next thing we knew,
we were in a hotel room.

05:15.031 --> 05:19.150
What you saw was me saying
good-bye to him.

05:19.151 --> 05:20.701
Well, then he must be
hard of hearing.

05:20.702 --> 05:22.770
You had his ear in your mouth.

05:25.324 --> 05:27.007
We both know it was a mistake.

05:27.042 --> 05:28.859
It will never happen again.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.378
What are you gonna do now?

05:30.379 --> 05:32.247
Well, there's only
one thing I can do.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.682
I have to tell Frasier.

05:34.717 --> 05:37.985
Now, until I find the time
to tell him in my own way,

05:38.019 --> 05:39.254
you must promise me

05:39.255 --> 05:41.639
you're not going to say
anything to him about this.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.241
Well, how the hell
am I gonna do that?

05:44.310 --> 05:45.560
What?

05:45.594 --> 05:47.895
Because this is juicy stuff.

05:47.896 --> 05:48.896
The more I'm sitting
here thinking

05:48.897 --> 05:49.947
that I should keep
my mouth shut,

05:49.948 --> 05:51.065
the more I want to
just go out there

05:51.066 --> 05:53.134
and blab it all over.

05:53.168 --> 05:55.169
I know that's wrong,
but it's just me.

05:55.170 --> 05:57.271
Please, Rebecca, you'll only
have to control yourself

05:57.272 --> 05:58.372
for a little while.

05:58.373 --> 05:59.807
Frasier and I are
going to have dinner

05:59.808 --> 06:01.308
with another couple
up at Melville's,

06:01.309 --> 06:03.911
and as soon as it's over,
I'll break it to him.

06:03.946 --> 06:06.180
Lilith, you have
a big problem. Yes, I know.

06:06.198 --> 06:09.567
My entire marriage
is on extremely shaky ground.

06:09.568 --> 06:10.970
No, I mean you only have
about an hour

06:10.971 --> 06:12.186
until I blow.

06:22.931 --> 06:24.699
Hi. Welcome to Cheers.

06:24.733 --> 06:28.135
You want to feel
the plate in my head?

06:28.220 --> 06:30.071
I can make it move.

06:30.072 --> 06:31.923
No, uh, we're just
looking for friends,

06:31.924 --> 06:33.891
and, uh, they're not here.
So, bye.

06:33.892 --> 06:38.612
Sammy, that's guy's making me
a little nervous, okay?

06:38.613 --> 06:40.349
What're you talking about?
The guy's great.

06:40.350 --> 06:43.334
He's already stopped two fights,
keeping everybody in line.

06:43.335 --> 06:46.225
Best of all, he thinks minimum
wage is two dollars an hour.

06:47.873 --> 06:51.091
Wow, you're cheating him
out of 50 cents an hour?

06:52.661 --> 06:55.029
Boy, I'll tell you,
having Tiny in this bar

06:55.030 --> 06:56.330
is about the most exciting thing

06:56.331 --> 06:58.500
that's happened around here
in a long time.

06:58.501 --> 07:02.102
Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't.

07:02.103 --> 07:03.988
No, I-I think the most
exciting thing, uh,

07:03.989 --> 07:05.456
contrary to your belief, Carla,

07:05.457 --> 07:07.925
was when, uh, Sammy fiddled
around with the cable box

07:07.926 --> 07:09.527
and we were able to get
The Playboy Channel

07:09.528 --> 07:11.362
all day long, huh?

07:11.363 --> 07:13.781
Well, you know, some people
who didn't know any better

07:13.782 --> 07:17.284
might think that
that was interesting.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.853
Well, how about, uh, last week

07:18.854 --> 07:20.604
when Phil told us
that he did time?

07:21.957 --> 07:23.858
Now that was juicy.

07:23.893 --> 07:24.959
Yeah.

07:24.994 --> 07:26.544
Oh, yeah, real juicy.

07:26.578 --> 07:30.714
(scoffs) I don't think so.

07:30.715 --> 07:32.534
What are you trying
to say, Rebecca?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.203
I'm trying to say
that I have got major dish

07:35.237 --> 07:36.971
bottled up inside me.

07:37.006 --> 07:38.806
And it's just dying to get out.

07:38.874 --> 07:41.309
Oh, God, here it comes.
I can feel it.

07:41.343 --> 07:43.143
It's coming up
through my chest.

07:43.179 --> 07:45.562
I can feel it in my throat.

07:45.631 --> 07:49.834
It's...

07:49.885 --> 07:52.436
(mumbling)

07:57.776 --> 08:00.994
So, Phil, what did
you do time for?

08:01.030 --> 08:03.580
I held up a Piggly Wiggly.

08:04.984 --> 08:08.118
Can I now get on with my life,
please?

08:11.656 --> 08:14.258
Is the, uh, TV too loud
for you folks?

08:14.293 --> 08:15.793
SAM:
Tiny?

08:15.828 --> 08:18.428
The TV's not actually on.

08:18.497 --> 08:22.199
Then why do I keep hearing
the Kill 'Em, Tiny show?

08:28.891 --> 08:30.124
Sammy, you heard that.

08:30.158 --> 08:32.559
The guy is nuts.

08:32.561 --> 08:33.628
Oh, yeah, maybe you're right.

08:33.629 --> 08:34.895
Maybe I should just, you know,
talk to him.

08:34.897 --> 08:36.397
Tiny, could I talk to you
for a second?

08:36.398 --> 08:38.182
Yo!

08:38.234 --> 08:39.734
How you doing?

08:39.768 --> 08:40.934
Oh, great, Sam.

08:40.970 --> 08:42.436
Listen, and don't you worry.

08:42.437 --> 08:44.606
There won't be any trouble
in here while I'm around.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.474
I just hope somebody tries.

08:46.475 --> 08:48.209
Do you want me to tell
you what I'm gonna do

08:48.210 --> 08:49.744
if somebody starts
some trouble?

08:49.745 --> 08:51.412
Uh, no, actually,

08:51.446 --> 08:53.447
I don't think
I want to hear that, man.

08:53.532 --> 08:57.151
Okay, but I did
draw you a picture.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.272
Well, how can I...

09:01.306 --> 09:03.608
Oh, my God.

09:03.642 --> 09:05.476
Uh...

09:05.511 --> 09:07.778
So, uh, did you want
to tell me something?

09:07.812 --> 09:11.349
No, well, no, no,
uh, just, uh, carry on.

09:11.383 --> 09:13.084
Carry on.
Okay.

09:16.288 --> 09:18.423
Carla...

09:18.457 --> 09:20.158
look what this guy drew.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.859
That's nothing.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.161
I got worse than that
on my refrigerator.

09:26.198 --> 09:28.482
Here is my question.

09:28.483 --> 09:29.851
Now I had the seafood salad.

09:29.852 --> 09:32.319
You had the poached salmon.

09:32.354 --> 09:34.555
Neither of us
had any appetizers.

09:34.589 --> 09:36.590
They had appetizers and soup

09:36.625 --> 09:38.626
and the lobster special,

09:38.661 --> 09:40.594
and yet we split the
meal fifty-fifty.

09:40.629 --> 09:43.159
Now, am I wrong, or did
we just get royally ripped?

09:43.916 --> 09:45.749
Frasier, we need to talk.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.001
You're darned right we do.
I don't know

09:47.002 --> 09:48.136
if I want them
as friends anymore.

09:48.137 --> 09:49.787
No, I mean I have
to tell you something

09:49.788 --> 09:50.921
that's rather serious.

09:50.922 --> 09:52.256
What is it, Lilith?
In fact,

09:52.257 --> 09:54.692
I dare say you're gonna
find it extremely upsetting.

09:54.693 --> 09:55.743
All right.

09:55.744 --> 09:57.428
Well, I think we should
discuss it at home.

09:57.429 --> 09:59.296
No, no, no, Lilith,
you just don't tell someone

09:59.297 --> 10:01.532
that you're going to upset them
and then just let them dangle.

10:01.533 --> 10:02.967
Whatever it is,
just tell me right now.

10:02.968 --> 10:04.635
I'll be upset,
then I'll get over it.

10:04.636 --> 10:06.037
We can go on with our lives.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.905
Please, let's just go home.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.640
No, Lilith, I want to know

10:09.641 --> 10:10.541
right now.

10:10.542 --> 10:12.543
All right, if you
must know immediately,

10:12.544 --> 10:13.877
I'll tell you.

10:13.912 --> 10:15.712
Have a seat.

10:15.747 --> 10:17.081
Oh, great.

10:17.115 --> 10:19.550
It's... It's "have a seat" bad.

10:21.253 --> 10:22.920
Just-Just

10:22.955 --> 10:25.522
give me a minute to,
uh, to brace myself.

10:25.556 --> 10:29.526
Uh, I know, I'll simply
imagine the worst thing

10:29.527 --> 10:30.928
you could possibly tell me,

10:30.929 --> 10:34.999
and whatever your news is,
it will pale by comparison.

10:35.100 --> 10:38.653
In fact, whatever it is,
it... it'll be a relief.

10:38.655 --> 10:40.304
Okay, okay, uh...

10:40.306 --> 10:43.524
what is the worst thing
I can imagine?

10:43.609 --> 10:45.309
All right, I've got it.

10:45.361 --> 10:47.461
Lilith, your news, please.

10:49.964 --> 10:51.699
This afternoon,

10:51.733 --> 10:55.102
in a moment
of extreme weakness...

10:56.488 --> 10:58.456
I cheated on you.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.957
That was it!

10:59.991 --> 11:01.425
That was the worst thing!

11:01.460 --> 11:02.793
Try to remain calm.

11:02.828 --> 11:03.994
How can I remain calm

11:03.995 --> 11:05.896
when you tell me you
slept with another man?!

11:05.897 --> 11:08.131
You slut!

11:12.004 --> 11:15.139
I-I... I can't
believe that.

11:18.877 --> 11:20.978
I knew the whole time.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.731
I have known it
for over an hour.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.801
And I didn't say
a word to anybody.

11:26.835 --> 11:29.837
(singsongy):
I kept a secret. I kept...

11:29.855 --> 11:32.489
Tragic, isn't it?

11:47.672 --> 11:50.141
You're still angry, aren't you?

11:50.175 --> 11:52.043
How can you tell?

11:52.044 --> 11:54.412
The fact that this park bench
used to be chained

11:54.413 --> 11:58.649
to that cement block next to
the statue of George Washington.

11:58.683 --> 12:01.285
I wanted to be alone.

12:05.773 --> 12:08.742
This is a very serious
matter, Frasier.

12:08.776 --> 12:11.278
Yes, it is serious, Lilith.

12:11.313 --> 12:15.015
However, I will refrain from
indulging in clichéd reactions...

12:15.017 --> 12:17.818
rage, the crying,
the screaming,

12:17.836 --> 12:20.070
the hurling of epithets:

12:20.105 --> 12:23.674
Tramp, whore, slut, floozy,
bitch, ad infinitum.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.595
You did call me slut.

12:27.679 --> 12:31.231
Yes, but I didn't call you a
tramp, whore, floozy or bitch.

12:31.265 --> 12:33.333
I have too much
respect for you...

12:33.367 --> 12:35.402
even though you have
been a slut.

12:37.439 --> 12:39.840
Of course you deserve to know

12:39.874 --> 12:41.842
everything that happened
and why.

12:41.843 --> 12:43.277
Look, all I want
to know is who.

12:43.278 --> 12:44.678
Who it is doesn't matter.

12:44.713 --> 12:46.280
This is about us.

12:46.281 --> 12:48.666
The identity of the other
person is irrelevant.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.918
Fine, Lilith, I respect that.

12:50.953 --> 12:54.288
It'll be just one more
secret between us.

12:54.322 --> 12:56.356
One more brick in the wall.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.243
All right.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.979
It was my colleague,

13:02.013 --> 13:05.949
the distinguished research
scientist, Dr. Louis Pascal.

13:05.968 --> 13:07.768
The bald guy?!

13:07.802 --> 13:09.102
Frasier...

13:09.137 --> 13:11.605
I never meant to hurt you.

13:11.690 --> 13:15.426
But for so long now
I have felt so alone.

13:15.460 --> 13:18.228
It seems we can't talk without
getting into a fight.

13:18.263 --> 13:21.298
Even the smallest conversation
erupts into bickering.

13:21.299 --> 13:24.051
It just goes on every...
Oh, I can see what's going on here.

13:24.052 --> 13:26.020
I can't believe I didn't
think of this sooner.

13:26.021 --> 13:27.254
I'm such a dope.

13:27.288 --> 13:28.689
What are you talking about?

13:28.723 --> 13:30.991
You're in your
mid-30s, right? Yes.

13:30.992 --> 13:32.459
It's perfectly natural for you

13:32.460 --> 13:34.270
to be examining
your life right now.

13:34.295 --> 13:36.525
You are comparing
the expectations you had

13:36.531 --> 13:37.831
of yourself in the past

13:37.832 --> 13:39.667
with what you've actually
achieved up to now.

13:39.668 --> 13:41.435
Frasier, that...
No, no, wait.

13:41.436 --> 13:42.503
Wait, let me finish.

13:42.504 --> 13:44.171
And how many years
have we been married?

13:44.172 --> 13:45.723
Seven.

13:45.757 --> 13:47.508
The perfect time for you

13:47.593 --> 13:50.277
to be re-examining
our relationship.

13:50.312 --> 13:52.046
You're practically a cliché.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.914
Frasier, I am not a cliché.

13:53.915 --> 13:56.517
I'm talking about something... Oh, please,
you got hit with the old double whammy.

13:56.518 --> 13:59.252
Of course you had a fling.
And why wouldn't you?

13:59.253 --> 14:01.606
Thank God. For a while I thought
we had a problem.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.407
Frasier, you're not
listening to me.

14:03.408 --> 14:05.109
"You're not listening to me."
Right out of the textbook.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.695
I can't tell you
how annoying this is. Of course you can.

14:07.696 --> 14:10.331
Volumes have been written on how
annoying analysis can get.

14:10.332 --> 14:11.965
Frasier, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

14:11.966 --> 14:14.168
This is our marriage
we're talking about.

14:14.202 --> 14:15.635
Our lives.

14:15.670 --> 14:18.839
Stop being a psychiatrist
and start being my husband.

14:22.376 --> 14:25.312
All right, Lilith.

14:25.346 --> 14:27.280
I'll be your husband.

14:27.315 --> 14:29.482
(distant bell tolling)

14:34.956 --> 14:37.457
But for seven years now

14:37.491 --> 14:40.627
we've tried to build
something together,

14:40.662 --> 14:42.730
and I think we've done
a pretty good job.

14:42.764 --> 14:46.000
It's not worth throwing
it all away on something

14:46.034 --> 14:48.986
so empty, meaningless
and unfulfilling.

14:49.020 --> 14:51.121
Actually...

14:51.155 --> 14:53.023
I don't want to hear it!

14:53.057 --> 14:56.393
Frasier, don't you
see that this incident

14:56.428 --> 15:00.131
is symptomatic of
much larger problems?

15:00.165 --> 15:02.850
We can work on that.

15:02.884 --> 15:05.486
We owe it to our marriage.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.288
But you must march over
to Pascal

15:08.322 --> 15:10.240
and tell him,
in no uncertain terms,

15:10.274 --> 15:13.059
that you will never
see him again.

15:15.463 --> 15:17.431
Very well.

15:17.465 --> 15:19.733
I'll go now.

15:22.137 --> 15:24.871
Certainly you're being
very rational about this.

15:24.906 --> 15:26.357
Very civilized.

15:26.391 --> 15:30.210
Well, I'm... I'm nothing
if not civilized.

15:31.095 --> 15:32.697
By the way,

15:32.731 --> 15:36.500
this Pascal, is he married?

15:36.534 --> 15:38.052
No.

15:38.086 --> 15:39.587
Why?

15:39.621 --> 15:43.540
I thought I could bag his wife,
even the score.

15:45.243 --> 15:47.594
I'm sorry. I'm venting.

15:47.628 --> 15:49.279
Go.

15:58.656 --> 16:00.224
Oh, people. Sheesh.

16:00.258 --> 16:03.444
Think they'd never seen
a blowtorch scar before.

16:03.478 --> 16:04.829
Wow.

16:06.398 --> 16:07.848
Who took a blowtorch to you?

16:07.849 --> 16:08.849
I did.

16:08.850 --> 16:09.984
I let myself down.

16:10.018 --> 16:11.518
Nobody lets Tiny down.

16:13.438 --> 16:15.656
Sammy, you've gotta
get rid of that guy.

16:15.657 --> 16:16.807
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

16:16.808 --> 16:18.041
You're right,
you're right. Let him come.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.242
I'll fire him.

16:21.879 --> 16:24.715
Say, um... Tiny?

16:24.716 --> 16:26.517
Could you step over
here for a second?

16:26.518 --> 16:28.169
Oh.
Um...

16:28.170 --> 16:30.237
Listen, I want to talk to
you about the job for a minute.

16:30.238 --> 16:31.672
I want you to know

16:31.706 --> 16:34.108
it's not that we don't
like having you here.

16:34.142 --> 16:37.011
It-It's just
that, uh, well...

16:37.045 --> 16:38.262
Knock, knock.

16:42.353 --> 16:44.402
I'm sorry. What?

16:44.403 --> 16:45.669
Knock, knock.

16:47.205 --> 16:48.572
Who's there?

16:48.606 --> 16:49.923
The dead guy.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.777
Oh, boy.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.248
The, uh, dead guy who?

16:57.282 --> 16:58.542
The dead guy that I killed.

16:58.550 --> 16:59.816
Get it?

17:03.988 --> 17:07.124
I thought I heard 'em all, man.

17:07.157 --> 17:08.709
Oh...

17:08.742 --> 17:11.512
So, uh, what were you
saying about the job?

17:11.546 --> 17:13.997
Uh, well, it was just that, uh,

17:14.031 --> 17:16.884
we-we were all...
talking and,

17:16.917 --> 17:19.637
uh...

17:19.671 --> 17:23.272
we have decided, uh, to make
you the Employee of the Month.

17:24.843 --> 17:26.076
Thank you.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.211
Yeah, all right.

17:27.244 --> 17:28.479
All right, thanks.

17:28.512 --> 17:30.314
Sam, what gives?

17:30.315 --> 17:32.950
I've been working my butt off
for you for seven years,

17:32.951 --> 17:35.481
and you're making Tiny the
Employee of the Month?

17:35.486 --> 17:36.954
Not, not now, man.

17:36.988 --> 17:39.323
I-I'm trying to think of
a way to get rid of him.

17:39.357 --> 17:42.293
Boy, you are one fickle guy.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.261
All right, all right, please,

17:44.296 --> 17:46.029
please, help me,
help me out here.

17:46.030 --> 17:47.230
Excuse me, excuse me. Wait.

17:47.231 --> 17:49.166
Can I just be the voice
of reason here

17:49.200 --> 17:52.386
and suggest that we keep Tiny.

17:52.420 --> 17:55.155
Personally, I think he's
a welcome addition

17:55.190 --> 17:56.640
to the Cheers family.

17:56.674 --> 17:59.477
Please, we gotta
do this, Carla.

17:59.511 --> 18:02.145
I get it. This is
an ego thing, huh? Right?

18:02.180 --> 18:04.348
A handsome man comes
into this bar,

18:04.382 --> 18:07.985
and you just can't
stand it, can you?

18:08.019 --> 18:10.437
Wait, hold it.
I've got an idea.

18:10.438 --> 18:11.772
I got an idea.
Wait, whoa, whoa.

18:11.773 --> 18:13.357
Listen, come here.
What we do

18:13.358 --> 18:15.091
is we tell him
that Cheers was built

18:15.092 --> 18:17.728
on an ancient burial ground
and we scare him out of here.

18:17.729 --> 18:19.479
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
CLIFF: Wait, wait, no,

18:19.480 --> 18:20.748
I got one, I got one.

18:20.749 --> 18:22.950
No, no, listen,
this is very popular nowadays.

18:22.951 --> 18:25.035
Tell him we have radon gas,
very deadly,

18:25.036 --> 18:27.705
seeping up through the
floorboards, and we're all goners anyway.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.072
Yeah, okay, what
about a bomb threat?

18:29.073 --> 18:31.542
What about treating him like
a human being with feelings?

18:31.543 --> 18:33.276
No, that-that
would nev...

18:35.046 --> 18:36.847
Oh, man,

18:36.881 --> 18:39.049
I'm sorry.
We never, we...

18:39.083 --> 18:41.218
Uh, I'm big, not deaf.

18:41.252 --> 18:43.020
I'll go now.

18:43.054 --> 18:45.155
Nice working with you folks.

18:53.982 --> 18:55.382
(laughing) Hey!

18:55.417 --> 18:57.718
Whoo! Yeah!

18:58.736 --> 18:59.987
Greetings, all.

18:59.988 --> 19:00.771
Hey, Frasier.

19:00.772 --> 19:02.039
What can we get you?

19:02.073 --> 19:04.241
Oh, uh, just a scotch,
please, Sam.

19:04.275 --> 19:06.610
Boy, what a day I've had.

19:06.644 --> 19:08.045
I'd like to unwind.

19:08.079 --> 19:09.413
I think I've earned it.

19:09.447 --> 19:12.283
Well, coming
right up, Dr. Crane.

19:18.023 --> 19:19.823
No, I've really
earned it, Woody.

19:23.878 --> 19:26.079
I mean, this was a real bad day.

19:28.383 --> 19:30.467
I'll tell you when
to stop, Woody.

19:35.690 --> 19:37.891
(glass pounding)

19:37.925 --> 19:39.443
(slurring):
One more, Woody.

19:39.477 --> 19:41.779
One more for the...

19:41.813 --> 19:44.581
the big stooge.

19:44.616 --> 19:47.418
One more for the big loser.

19:47.452 --> 19:49.420
One more for the big boob.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.021
Hey, hear that?

19:51.055 --> 19:53.624
Frasier wants to buy
you guys a drink.

19:56.327 --> 19:59.379
Woody, Woody, come to me
for a moment here.

20:01.182 --> 20:04.367
Listen, when you go
home tonight...

20:04.401 --> 20:05.552
to your wife Kelly,

20:05.586 --> 20:08.856
(voice breaking):
You treat her right.

20:08.890 --> 20:11.407
You promise me.

20:11.442 --> 20:13.309
Treat her right.

20:13.344 --> 20:15.345
Hell of a woman.

20:15.379 --> 20:18.314
If I wasn't married, I'd be all
over her like white on rice.

20:20.184 --> 20:23.921
That perky little
caboose of hers.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.241
There you go.

20:27.275 --> 20:28.575
What's this?

20:28.609 --> 20:30.661
That's, uh,
black coffee on the house.

20:30.695 --> 20:33.363
Very generous.

20:33.397 --> 20:35.466
You guys are true friends

20:35.500 --> 20:37.751
to stand by me
in my hour of need.

20:37.752 --> 20:39.870
Fras, come on, we all know
what you're going through.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.072
Oh, oh, do you, Norm?

20:42.107 --> 20:45.009
What if you found out Vera
was sleeping with another man?

20:45.043 --> 20:46.226
Yeah, right.

20:46.261 --> 20:49.179
And what if it rained beer?

20:49.213 --> 20:53.249
I want you all to know
I'm not blaming her.

20:53.284 --> 20:56.854
It's because of me that my life
is in the arms of another man.

20:56.888 --> 20:59.690
Uh, well, you mean "wife,"
don't you, Dr. Crane?

20:59.724 --> 21:01.075
What?
You said "life."

21:01.109 --> 21:04.445
"It's because of me my life
is in the arms of another man."

21:04.479 --> 21:07.197
Oh, that's a-that's a
Freudian slip there, Woody.

21:07.231 --> 21:08.431
What's a Freudian slip?

21:08.449 --> 21:10.234
Oh, that's when you say
one thing

21:10.268 --> 21:13.737
when you're actually thinking
about a mother.

21:17.142 --> 21:18.542
Frasier?

21:21.596 --> 21:23.997
I need to speak
with you in private.

21:24.031 --> 21:26.199
Oh, no, you don't.

21:26.234 --> 21:29.053
I want everyone here to hear
what I've got to say to you.

21:29.087 --> 21:30.971
Lilith, I realize

21:31.005 --> 21:34.641
that it is I and not
you who are to blame.

21:34.675 --> 21:36.810
Whatever you've done,

21:36.844 --> 21:40.347
I'm sure I gave you
ample reason for it.

21:40.381 --> 21:44.284
I've been...
arrogant, overbearing,

21:44.319 --> 21:46.553
selfish, self-absorbed.

21:46.587 --> 21:48.721
I've spent way too much
time in this place.

21:48.722 --> 21:50.991
I really think we should go
somewhere else to discuss this.

21:50.992 --> 21:53.526
No, Lilith, so you
had a fling? So what?

21:53.561 --> 21:55.162
I've put all that behind me.

21:56.230 --> 21:58.382
I forgive you.

21:58.416 --> 22:01.635
And I-I take you back
with open arms.

22:01.669 --> 22:04.388
I'm sorry, Frasier.

22:04.422 --> 22:06.940
I wanted to break it
off with Dr. Pascal,

22:06.941 --> 22:09.092
but I'm afraid it's
more serious than I thought.

22:09.093 --> 22:11.945
I think I'm in love with him.

22:11.979 --> 22:14.330
And... I'm leaving you.

22:21.906 --> 22:25.175
Oh, this is twice today

22:25.209 --> 22:27.861
that I publicly
made a fool of myself.

22:27.895 --> 22:30.547
Oh, you get used to it, Doc.
