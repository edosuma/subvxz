WEBVTT

00:03.812 --> 00:05.895
You sure about this, Wasp?

00:05.930 --> 00:08.348
Oh, Captain Marvel's stalling.

00:08.383 --> 00:09.716
You afraid?

00:09.751 --> 00:11.493
Just giving you an out.

00:11.528 --> 00:13.212
[growls]

00:13.247 --> 00:14.713
Your funeral.

00:16.491 --> 00:19.468
[grunts]

00:19.503 --> 00:22.420
I could've gotten a snack in the time
it took you to return that serve.

00:22.455 --> 00:24.523
[grunts]

00:24.558 --> 00:28.101
That makes 11 points in a row.

00:28.136 --> 00:30.712
I'm gonna wipe that smug smirk
off your face.

00:30.748 --> 00:31.838
[laughs]

00:31.874 --> 00:33.640
[grunts]

00:33.675 --> 00:35.758
Whoa, settle down.
It's just a game.

00:35.794 --> 00:36.794
[grunts]

00:38.080 --> 00:41.056
[grunting]

00:41.091 --> 00:43.208
Sorry, Vision.
This might take a while.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.819
I can see that. I will wait.

00:45.854 --> 00:47.162
I have... next.

00:49.482 --> 00:50.940
[grunts]

00:50.976 --> 00:52.417
[laughs]

00:52.453 --> 00:54.328
Perhaps I will step back.

00:54.363 --> 00:56.254
For a better view,
and my own safety.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.158
[grunts]

01:02.888 --> 01:04.804
You really can't stand to lose.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.690
Did you rig a trick ball?

01:06.725 --> 01:09.943
No. The trick's on you.

01:09.979 --> 01:12.588
Crimson Widow.

01:12.623 --> 01:15.516
The only survivor of the
reactivated Black Widow program.

01:15.551 --> 01:19.310
The only one worthy
of surviving.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.939
You've got some nerve, Widow,
busting into our house

01:21.974 --> 01:23.254
and busting up our game. [Yells]

01:27.145 --> 01:28.245
[grunts]

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.655 --> 01:38.655
[grunts]

01:49.218 --> 01:52.361
It's over. Fair enough.

01:52.396 --> 01:53.865
Calculating your firing arc
was simple.

01:53.889 --> 01:56.565
Easy to expect.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.818
But what you don't expect
can be the most deadly.

02:01.638 --> 02:02.604
[grunts]

02:02.639 --> 02:03.947
Vision!

02:06.293 --> 02:08.877
[laughing]

02:08.912 --> 02:11.605
This is the Avengers.

02:11.640 --> 02:15.167
All new, all different,
all finished.

02:29.934 --> 02:31.941
Dasvidanya.

02:31.976 --> 02:33.476
You wish. [Grunts]

02:42.079 --> 02:43.779
Wasp, hit the alarm!

02:43.814 --> 02:44.988
A little busy.

02:46.558 --> 02:48.533
Some team player. [Grunts]

02:50.946 --> 02:52.537
[alarm blaring]

02:53.940 --> 02:55.698
[grunts]

02:55.733 --> 02:57.834
[grunts]

03:01.582 --> 03:03.498
[alarm continues blaring] Yikes.

03:03.533 --> 03:05.834
Must be some game of Ping-Pong.

03:05.869 --> 03:08.428
[grunts]

03:09.914 --> 03:11.139
[grunts]

03:11.174 --> 03:12.265
Aah!

03:15.070 --> 03:16.102
Look out! Whoa!

03:18.882 --> 03:20.065
Tag! You're it!

03:20.100 --> 03:21.750
Aah!

03:21.785 --> 03:23.610
All yours, Ms. Marvel.

03:26.773 --> 03:28.297
[grunts, gasps]

03:28.333 --> 03:30.825
This is your opportunity
to surrender.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.014
I recommend that you take it.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.266
[laughing]

03:38.301 --> 03:41.152
[beeping]

03:41.187 --> 03:44.114
Vision does not have
a normal body.

03:44.149 --> 03:46.132
It is going to take some work
to patch him up.

03:46.167 --> 03:48.635
Stay on it, Black Panther.
In the meantime,

03:48.670 --> 03:50.596
I'm gonna transport
Crimson Widow to lockup.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.248
I'll come with.

03:53.283 --> 03:55.317
Maybe take Ms. Marvel
with you too.

03:55.352 --> 03:58.570
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

03:58.647 --> 04:01.423
I just thought maybe
you could use another person.

04:01.458 --> 04:05.060
You trying to say I can't handle it?
No, of course not.

04:05.095 --> 04:07.665
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just
going to get back to fixing Vision

04:07.689 --> 04:10.599
and awkwardly eject myself
from this conversation.

04:10.634 --> 04:12.734
Wasp and I will take care
of Crimson Widow.

04:12.769 --> 04:14.703
You just make sure
Vision's okay.

04:25.865 --> 04:29.017
Welcome to the Vault, the most
secure prison in the world.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.195
And lucky you, they've got
a single room waiting.

04:32.231 --> 04:36.107
You Avengers, too arrogant
for your own good.

04:36.142 --> 04:38.960
You've no chance of holding me.

04:38.995 --> 04:40.815
That's pretty much
what every supervillain says.

04:40.839 --> 04:44.115
This place is buried hundreds
of feet into a mountain,

04:44.150 --> 04:46.417
miles from civilization.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.720
So get comfy.
You ain't going anywhere.

04:48.756 --> 04:52.365
Red Skull, Leader...

04:52.400 --> 04:54.667
It's like a Who's Who
of butts we've kicked.

04:54.702 --> 04:56.636
The worst of the worst.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.455
You'll fit right in.

04:58.490 --> 05:02.058
You.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.544
You must be the one
they call Captain Marvel.

05:04.580 --> 05:08.031
I must be.
We haven't met, have we?

05:08.066 --> 05:10.959
You and your little friend?
[chuckles]

05:10.994 --> 05:14.479
Remember my name. Remember that
in a world of ordinary mortals,

05:14.515 --> 05:16.839
I am Zarda.

05:16.875 --> 05:20.085
W-Wait. Did you just
call me "little friend"?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.704
Ooh, the Wasp
wants to take on Zarda.

05:22.739 --> 05:26.299
[laughing]

05:26.334 --> 05:29.961
[grunts]
That would be fun to watch.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.014
Typhoid Mary. You do not wanna
let her get in your head.

05:33.050 --> 05:35.208
[laughing]

05:35.243 --> 05:38.445
[singsongy] Too late.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.760
[Captain Marvel]
Home sweet home.

05:43.077 --> 05:44.709
[Wasp]
What are you so happy about?

05:46.154 --> 05:47.887
[grunts]

05:47.922 --> 05:48.922
Look out! [Grunts]

05:52.494 --> 05:55.654
Dasvidanya, Avengers. Again.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.787
[laughing]

05:56.823 --> 05:58.014
[groans]

06:00.643 --> 06:03.135
I may have been a bit impetuous,

06:03.171 --> 06:06.656
but you can help me
get my plan back on track.

06:06.691 --> 06:08.958
You said you wanted
to fight the Avengers.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.878
Today is your lucky day, Zarda.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.572
[beeping]

06:13.607 --> 06:16.799
[grunts, yells]

06:16.835 --> 06:19.402
To test their mettle
on the battlefield?

06:19.437 --> 06:21.596
It'll be glorious.

06:21.632 --> 06:24.332
Pretty sure no one
authorized any recess.

06:24.368 --> 06:26.201
[knuckles crack] Finally,

06:26.236 --> 06:28.261
after all this time
in captivity,

06:28.296 --> 06:31.080
a challenge worthy of Zarda.

06:31.115 --> 06:32.382
[yells]

06:34.252 --> 06:35.760
Then bring it!

06:38.848 --> 06:40.998
Why should I let Zarda
have all the fun?

06:41.034 --> 06:42.592
[grunts]

06:42.627 --> 06:45.804
[grunts]

06:45.839 --> 06:48.840
I've no interest
in you, mere bug!

06:48.875 --> 06:52.143
I am not a bug,
and I am not your little friend.

06:52.178 --> 06:54.279
[yells, grunts]

06:54.314 --> 06:55.572
No!

06:59.394 --> 07:01.611
[Crimson Widow]
Aw, you look exhausted, Wasp.

07:01.646 --> 07:04.146
Time to close your eyes...

07:04.182 --> 07:05.748
forever!

07:11.556 --> 07:13.706
Get away from her! [Grunts]

07:13.741 --> 07:15.916
[grunts]

07:15.952 --> 07:19.053
You should worry more
about your own skin.

07:19.088 --> 07:21.472
[beeps] Ugh! This is
the coward's way out.

07:21.508 --> 07:24.342
I want to destroy them
in combat!

07:24.378 --> 07:27.937
Have you never heard the saying,
"Patience is a virtue"?

07:27.973 --> 07:30.390
Virtue is to crush your enemies,

07:30.425 --> 07:32.659
see them driven before you,

07:32.694 --> 07:35.511
and hear the lamentations
of their men!

07:35.547 --> 07:37.414
We have work to do.

07:37.449 --> 07:40.525
Leave them here
to enjoy their agony.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.411
Somehow I think you
enjoy it more.

07:45.748 --> 07:49.684
Great. Now let's find a way out.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.990
None of this would've happened if
you hadn't tried to rescue me.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.747
Uh, Crimson Widow
was gonna blast you.

07:53.782 --> 07:56.591
I can take care of myself.

07:56.626 --> 07:59.186
Hmm.

07:59.262 --> 08:01.713
Good idea, but I'll need
a boat and some monkeys.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.015
Oh, hi, friends. [Beeping]

08:05.543 --> 08:06.543
[beeps]

08:08.279 --> 08:11.356
Typhoid Mary is loose.

08:11.391 --> 08:14.967
[singsongy] But I'm telling you
now, not much of a team player.

08:15.002 --> 08:16.427
[normal voice] I work alone.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.646
We all work alone.

08:18.682 --> 08:21.916
But help me,
and we can all get out of here.

08:21.951 --> 08:24.035
How do we know we can trust you?

08:24.071 --> 08:26.813
[chuckles] You can't.

08:26.848 --> 08:29.707
You can't trust me.
You can't trust anyone.

08:29.742 --> 08:32.659
And if things go bad,
I won't hesitate for a moment

08:32.695 --> 08:36.014
to sell you out, or worse.

08:36.091 --> 08:40.018
Wow. You are one horrible,
soulless, evil woman.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.687
I'm in. [Footsteps]

08:42.722 --> 08:44.923
Hold it right there. [Beeps]

08:44.958 --> 08:47.392
Aw. The guards
have come out to play.

08:49.287 --> 08:51.312
[guards coughing]

08:54.108 --> 08:58.370
Merciless Minerva. I like it.

08:58.446 --> 09:02.173
[vital signs monitor beeping]
This is concerning.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.518
Vision's self-repair systems
are still only in standby mode,

09:05.553 --> 09:08.946
and his life-sign readings
continue to fade.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.774
[monitor beeping rapidly,
alarm sounding]

09:11.809 --> 09:13.734
Vital signs are crashing!
We are losing him!

09:13.769 --> 09:15.444
No, we're not. [Beeping]

09:15.480 --> 09:20.566
Get clear. I'm applying a countershock
to jolt his neural processor.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.185
[electricity zaps]
[alarm continues]

09:22.220 --> 09:25.246
No impact.
Vital signs still dropping fast!

09:25.281 --> 09:29.258
We gotta do something.
Anybody here know CPR?

09:29.294 --> 09:32.362
Won't do any good.
It's his systems going down.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.581
It's not like we're trying
to restart his heart.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.902
No. Perhaps that is exactly
what we need to do.

09:38.937 --> 09:41.070
Vision, friend,

09:41.106 --> 09:43.815
we are here to help you,

09:43.850 --> 09:45.942
but this battle is yours.

09:45.977 --> 09:48.469
You must fight
and come back to us.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.689
Come on, Vision. You can do it.
We believe in you, buddy.

09:51.724 --> 09:54.492
Vision, wake up! Right now!

09:54.527 --> 09:57.587
[alarm continues]

10:00.667 --> 10:03.000
[whines, beeps]

10:03.036 --> 10:06.312
[vital signs monitor
resumes beeping normally]

10:06.347 --> 10:08.589
His self-repair systems
are back online.

10:08.624 --> 10:10.374
He could hear us.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.768
Welcome back, Viz.

10:14.998 --> 10:18.124
Sorry about earlier.
I thought you needed saving.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.434
I should've trusted
you could handle it.

10:20.470 --> 10:23.246
It's fine. Everyone's always
trying to hold me back.

10:23.281 --> 10:25.381
My own father, Dr. Pym?

10:25.416 --> 10:29.402
He thought I wasn't ready for the
Wasp armor, so he made me wait.

10:29.437 --> 10:31.353
The Avengers
never asked me to join.

10:31.389 --> 10:33.381
They made me wait.

10:33.416 --> 10:34.933
No one's keeping track.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.368
Easy for you to say.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.704
I'm the one always having
to prove myself.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.507
You're an Avenger now.
You've already proven yourself.

10:44.118 --> 10:46.369
I recognize these.

10:46.404 --> 10:48.304
They're an advanced
security configuration.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.184
This'll require a light touch.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.995
Blast these. Blast these.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.522
Blow up the rest.
That should do it.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.284
Good job. Thanks.

11:01.319 --> 11:04.153
Now, how do we know
which way they went?

11:04.188 --> 11:06.856
[guards groaning]
They left us a trail.

11:06.892 --> 11:10.952
[Crimson Widow over P.A.]
Attention fellow prisoners.

11:10.987 --> 11:15.389
I offer you freedom and immediate
release from the Vault,

11:15.425 --> 11:18.326
but it will cost you... dearly.

11:18.361 --> 11:22.747
Money wired
into my secret account.

11:22.782 --> 11:27.668
Typhoid Mary and Princess Zarda are
coming around to collect. [Beeping]

11:27.704 --> 11:32.398
Once everyone has paid up,
I will open the doors.

11:32.434 --> 11:36.176
Then we will leave this place behind.
This is a new day.

11:36.212 --> 11:39.705
Crimson Widow wanted
into the Vault all along.

11:39.741 --> 11:42.809
And we totally fell for it.

11:42.844 --> 11:45.145
Vision's condition
has stabilized.

11:45.180 --> 11:48.706
[sighs]
That's good. Now we wait.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.559
I figure Captain Marvel or Wasp
would've checked in by now.

11:51.594 --> 11:54.612
You guys have been doing the work.
Let me get this one.

11:54.648 --> 11:57.473
Captain Marvel, Wasp,
are you there? Come in.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.284
No answer.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.410
They are inside the Vault.

12:01.446 --> 12:03.166
It is probably blocking
their communication.

12:04.666 --> 12:06.615
Avengers, anyone read me?

12:06.650 --> 12:08.576
Signal's not getting through.

12:08.611 --> 12:11.036
We can take them down
on our own.

12:11.072 --> 12:13.681
There's too much at stake. Crimson
Widow and her gang have a plan.

12:13.716 --> 12:15.775
We need one too.

12:15.810 --> 12:19.745
[beep] Hey, there, angry lady.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.690
Prisoners have paid up.
It's a go. [Beeps]

12:24.535 --> 12:25.693
[whirring]

12:27.138 --> 12:28.587
[beeps]

12:28.623 --> 12:30.723
We still can't get out of here.

12:30.758 --> 12:33.526
[beeps]
But once my password device

12:33.562 --> 12:36.912
cracks central security,
the exterior doors will open.

12:36.947 --> 12:40.792
Then everyone can walk out
as they please.

12:40.827 --> 12:43.186
Go after Crimson Widow.
I'll hold the prisoners here.

12:43.221 --> 12:48.867
You want me to go so you can do
it all yourself and save the day.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.938
I want you to go because I
trust you to take care of it.

12:50.962 --> 12:54.680
Use that tech knowledge of yours and
stop her from shutting down security.

13:02.365 --> 13:06.434
Not happening. [Alarm blaring]

13:06.469 --> 13:10.488
[frustrated grunt]
What have we here?

13:12.466 --> 13:15.485
Ooh, a chance for some big,
big fun!

13:15.520 --> 13:17.611
Back off! This one's mine.

13:17.646 --> 13:19.130
[scoffs]

13:19.165 --> 13:20.456
[singsongy] All yours.

13:23.569 --> 13:24.752
[beeps]

13:26.022 --> 13:28.331
[gasps]

13:28.366 --> 13:30.716
She can't handle them both.

13:32.362 --> 13:34.095
[groans]

13:34.130 --> 13:36.455
Captain Marvel.

13:36.490 --> 13:40.209
They say you are strong,
powerful,

13:40.244 --> 13:42.978
the mightiest woman
on the planet.

13:43.014 --> 13:44.948
They do?
That's nice of 'em to say.

13:44.983 --> 13:49.152
They'll say those things
about me after I finish you!

13:49.187 --> 13:50.111
[yells, grunts]

13:50.146 --> 13:51.187
Hmph!

13:51.222 --> 13:53.281
[growls]

13:53.316 --> 13:55.524
[grunts, yells]

13:55.559 --> 13:57.509
[grunts]

13:57.545 --> 13:59.453
You draw first, I draw last!

14:00.932 --> 14:01.932
Get away from her!

14:01.958 --> 14:03.124
Aah!

14:04.561 --> 14:06.685
[grunts] Look!

14:06.721 --> 14:08.880
Someone for me to fight. Yay!

14:08.915 --> 14:11.949
[groans, grunts]

14:11.984 --> 14:16.220
Whoo! I'm having fun!
So much fun!

14:16.256 --> 14:18.247
Now come here. [Grunts]

14:18.283 --> 14:20.425
[grunts]

14:20.460 --> 14:22.401
But now it's already over.

14:22.437 --> 14:24.478
Boo! Stomp!

14:26.949 --> 14:34.338
Aah! [Thud]

14:34.374 --> 14:36.177
Appreciate you having my back,
butBut I thought you... [sighs]

14:36.201 --> 14:41.053
Of course you didn't need my help.
I tried to do too much.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.639
You said you were always
being held back by others.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.991
Now the only one
holding you back is you.

14:46.027 --> 14:48.677
Go do your thing.
I'll take care of these two.

14:48.712 --> 14:50.212
I won't let you down.

14:53.643 --> 14:57.987
Ooh, I've got a fever,
and I'm on fire!

14:58.022 --> 14:59.513
[grunting]

15:01.651 --> 15:05.136
[coughing]

15:05.171 --> 15:08.398
Ooh, goody.
I'm in your head now.

15:08.433 --> 15:11.283
[all grunting]

15:11.318 --> 15:13.427
Captain Marvel is mine!

15:13.462 --> 15:15.605
[singsongy]
Not if I get her first.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.841
Aahh! Suffering savage!

15:18.877 --> 15:22.095
Silly Zarda. You should've
stayed outta my way!

15:22.130 --> 15:24.780
My sentiments exactly!

15:24.815 --> 15:25.873
[yells]

15:27.902 --> 15:30.394
[grunts]

15:30.430 --> 15:33.330
That'll learn ya. [Grunts]

15:33.365 --> 15:35.733
[growls]

15:35.769 --> 15:38.494
You just did half my job
for me. Kudos.

15:38.529 --> 15:41.405
Now all is as it should be.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.457
You and me. To the death!

15:43.493 --> 15:44.493
[beeps]

15:49.006 --> 15:50.631
[beeps]

15:50.667 --> 15:52.817
[beeping]

15:56.489 --> 15:59.849
You didn't think I'd let my brilliant
device go unprotected, did you?

15:59.884 --> 16:03.727
You're the protection? Yeah,
I'm not too worried. [Grunts]

16:03.763 --> 16:05.871
[grunts]

16:09.235 --> 16:10.235
[grunts]

16:12.238 --> 16:14.588
Fine.

16:14.624 --> 16:16.298
You and me. [Grunts]

16:16.334 --> 16:17.614
[helmet clangs] [knuckles crack]

16:20.604 --> 16:22.880
[grunting]

16:22.915 --> 16:24.548
[grunts]

16:24.583 --> 16:25.975
[groans, chuckles]

16:28.746 --> 16:29.887
[yells]

16:29.922 --> 16:32.699
I am the product

16:32.775 --> 16:35.150
of the most deadly spy program
in human history.

16:35.185 --> 16:37.427
You don't stand a chance.
[device beeps]

16:37.463 --> 16:39.955
[beeping]

16:39.990 --> 16:42.450
Only two more characters to go.

16:42.485 --> 16:45.202
[both grunting]

16:48.966 --> 16:51.042
[grunting continues]

16:58.560 --> 17:01.452
Is that all you have?
Who taught you how to fight?

17:01.487 --> 17:03.388
[straining] Self-taught.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.972
[grunts, yells]

17:08.460 --> 17:09.468
[grunts]

17:09.502 --> 17:11.587
[grunts]

17:11.622 --> 17:13.806
I've faced warriors
stronger than you

17:13.840 --> 17:15.691
on countless battlefields.

17:15.727 --> 17:17.742
Men, women, old, young...

17:17.778 --> 17:19.520
I've bested them all!

17:19.555 --> 17:21.196
[yells]

17:22.516 --> 17:25.226
[grunts]

17:25.261 --> 17:28.220
I was hoping you would be
more of a challenge.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.756
But crushing you is no honor.

17:30.791 --> 17:32.767
It's just another chore.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.451
[yells] [yells]

17:34.486 --> 17:36.128
[grunts]

17:38.483 --> 17:39.757

17:39.792 --> 17:42.485
[yells, grunts]

17:42.520 --> 17:46.296
[chuckles]

17:46.332 --> 17:49.609
Gonna smack you right back
into your cage.

17:49.644 --> 17:53.195
[growls] I will never
be imprisoned again.

17:53.230 --> 17:56.390
[yelling] [grunts]

17:56.426 --> 17:59.476
Pathetic. You are the Avenger
weakling, aren't you?

17:59.511 --> 18:00.836
[yells]

18:00.871 --> 18:02.947
[grunting]

18:05.026 --> 18:06.275
[grunting] [groaning]

18:06.310 --> 18:08.977
[grunts]

18:09.012 --> 18:10.446
Who are you calling weakling?

18:10.481 --> 18:12.807
You. [Yells]

18:12.842 --> 18:14.483
[grunting]

18:14.519 --> 18:16.660
[beeping]

18:16.695 --> 18:18.721
[grunts]

18:18.756 --> 18:22.291

[grunts] [grunts]

18:27.198 --> 18:28.922
[yells]

18:28.957 --> 18:31.150
[groans]

18:31.185 --> 18:34.395
You are Captain Marvel.

18:34.430 --> 18:38.073
You were supposed to be
a battle worthy of Zarda.

18:38.108 --> 18:41.961
[grunting] [groans]

18:41.996 --> 18:44.588
[exhales] [yells]

18:44.623 --> 18:47.208
[groaning]

18:47.243 --> 18:50.686
But as always, victory is mine!

18:50.722 --> 18:52.738
Is that all you got?

18:52.773 --> 18:55.949
[yells]

18:55.984 --> 18:57.692
[yells]

18:57.728 --> 19:00.195
[grunts]

19:00.231 --> 19:01.255
[grunting]

19:05.661 --> 19:08.979
[groans]

19:09.014 --> 19:11.673
[exhales] You dare mock me?

19:11.708 --> 19:14.093
[yells]

19:14.128 --> 19:16.203
[grunts]

19:16.239 --> 19:18.847
I'm not mocking you.
I'm punching you!

19:18.882 --> 19:19.714
[growls, grunts]

19:19.750 --> 19:21.709
[grunts]

19:21.744 --> 19:24.111
[grunting]

19:26.916 --> 19:28.407
[grunting continues]

19:32.521 --> 19:35.405
Zarda has never fallen
in battle!

19:35.441 --> 19:37.875
I hate people who talk
in the third person.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.612
[yelling]

19:42.648 --> 19:44.398
[yelling]

19:44.433 --> 19:47.301
[yelling continues]

[grunts]

19:51.716 --> 19:54.124
[grunts, groans]

19:54.160 --> 19:55.493
[breathing heavily]

19:55.528 --> 19:57.094
You can surrender now,

19:57.129 --> 19:59.847
but I really hope you don't.

19:59.882 --> 20:03.308
By great Hera,
I will defeat you!

20:03.343 --> 20:04.610
[yells]

20:05.980 --> 20:07.279
[both grunting]

20:13.228 --> 20:14.519
[grunts]

20:14.555 --> 20:15.854
[grunts]

20:15.890 --> 20:18.432
[exhales]

20:18.468 --> 20:22.536
This proves nothing.
I'm still better than you.

20:22.571 --> 20:24.852
I don't have to prove anything
to anybody, especially you.

20:26.208 --> 20:28.526
No!

20:28.561 --> 20:32.488
[grunting]

20:32.523 --> 20:35.007
[screams]

20:35.042 --> 20:36.600
[grunts]

20:46.086 --> 20:48.537
[singsongy] Yoo-hoo! Zarda!

20:48.572 --> 20:50.322
We get to be neighbors.

20:53.836 --> 20:56.704
Dasvidanya, for good this time.

20:58.607 --> 21:02.710
Noooooo!

21:05.964 --> 21:08.165
Ready for the rematch?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.918
Why not? I've got
nothing to prove.

21:10.953 --> 21:13.145
But I'm still
gonna kick your butt.

21:13.180 --> 21:14.638
[grunts] You're on.

21:18.002 --> 21:19.726
You should take it easy, Vision.

21:19.762 --> 21:21.387
Yeah. You're
still self-repairing.

21:21.422 --> 21:23.464
But now that I am healthy again,

21:23.499 --> 21:24.898
I can finally
get in a game of...

21:30.231 --> 21:38.231
[sighs] I have next.
