We go further, so you can.
>> IT SOUNDED LIKE TEN TRAINS ON

00:12.579 --> 00:19.085
A TRACK, COMING TOWARDS YOU FULL
SPEED.
>> YOUR NEIGHBOR SHOT A VIDEO OF
THE TORNADO?

00:19.152 --> 00:27.794
>> YES, SIR.
>> A MILE WIDE, SPINNING AT 190
MILES AN HOUR, THE TORNADO
PROPELLED DEBRIS TO A HEIGHT OF

00:27.861 --> 00:38.805
30,000 FEET.
WHEN IT CLEARED?
A 15-MONTH-OLD AND A THREE-
MONTH-OLD WERE DELIVERED INTO

00:38.872 --> 00:41.508
THE WORLD AGAIN.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

00:44.844 --> 00:52.385
>> IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT, ON
THE EVE OF 2022, MANY AMERICANS
STILL LIVE WITHOUT SANITARY
SEWAGE SYSTEMS.

00:52.452 --> 01:02.395
NOT ONLY THAT, IN MANY CASES,
IMPOVERISHED RESIDENTS ARE
BREAKING STATE LAWS BY PIPING
UNTREATED WASTE DIRECTLY FROM

01:02.462 --> 01:09.803
THEIR HOMES ONTO THE GROUND.
I HAVE SEEN THINGS LIKE THIS IN
HAITI, AND PARTS OF SOUTHEAST
ASIA.

01:09.869 --> 01:15.508
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THIS IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> THAT'S WHY WE CALL IT
"AMERICA'S DIRTY SECRET."

01:15.575 --> 01:16.209
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:19.446 --> 01:25.452
>> TREVOR NOAH HAS BECOME ONE OF
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL-- AND
HIGHEST PAID-- COMEDIANS IN THE
WORLD.

01:25.518 --> 01:31.858
PRETTY GOOD, FOR A GUY WHO WAS
BORN IN SOUTH AFRICA AND WAS A
VIRTUAL UNKNOWN HERE WHEN HE
TOOK OVER "THE DAILY SHOW" FROM

01:31.925 --> 01:38.665
JON STEWART IN 2015.
WHAT'S THE SECRET TO HIS
SUCCESS?
MAYBE IT'S HIS OUTSIDER

01:38.731 --> 01:46.473
MENTALITY, OR HIS ABILITY TO
HANDLE MOST ANY TOPIC-- CANCEL
CULTURE, AND THE RECENT DAVE
CHAPPELLE CONTROVERSY.

01:46.539 --> 01:49.476
IN YOUR MIND, DID HE CROSS THE
LINE?
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:50.743 --> 01:55.682
>> I'M LESLEY STAHL.
>> I'M BILL WHITAKER.
>> I'M ANDERSON COOPER.
>> I'M SHARYN ALFONSI.

01:55.748 --> 02:01.221
>> I'M JON WERTHEIM.
>> I'M SCOTT PELLEY.
THOSE STORIES AND MORE, TONIGHT,
ON "60 MINUTES."

02:01.287 --> 02:06.726
(

02:08.528 --> 02:16.769
>> Scott Pelley: THE DEVASTATION
IS SO SEVERE, ACROSS SUCH AN
EXPANSE, THAT WE STILL DON'T
KNOW THE TOLL OF THE SOUTHERN

02:16.836 --> 02:25.078
AND MIDWESTERN TORNADOES.
STARTING THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER
10, AT LEAST 59 TWISTERS CARVED
THROUGH TEN STATES, A SWARM YOU

02:25.144 --> 02:32.418
WOULDN'T EXPECT TWO WEEKS BEFORE
WINTER.
WE SPENT THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS
IN KENTUCKY, WHERE IT WAS STILL

02:32.485 --> 02:41.728
STRANGELY WARM, AND QUESTIONS OF
CLIMATE CHANGE ARE BEING ASKED.
THE ANSWERS AREN'T CLEAR, BUT WE
DO KNOW WHAT WE SAW IS RARE.

02:41.794 --> 02:51.604
THE STORM THREW DOWN ONE TWISTER
THAT CUT A PATH OF DESTRUCTION
OF MORE THAN 165 MILES.
ONE METEOROLOGIST WE TALKED WITH

02:51.671 --> 03:01.915
CALLED THAT TORNADO "THE BEAST."
ALL THAT RISES FROM A LEVELED
LANDSCAPE ARE BONFIRES OF
MEMORIES.

03:01.981 --> 03:10.924
ON THE RICKARD FARM IN WESTERN
KENTUCKY, THEY BURN WHAT THEY
CAN'T SAVE FROM THE TWO-STORY
BRICK HOME THAT SEEMED

03:10.990 --> 03:20.433
UNSHAKABLE ON THAT FOUNDATION
DOWN THERE ON THE RIGHT AND THE
GARAGE BY ITS SIDE.
>> Shawn Rickard: IT SOUNDED

03:20.500 --> 03:26.039
LIKE TEN TRAINS ON A TRACK,
COMING TOWARDS YOU FULL SPEED.
>> Pelley: YOUR NEIGHBOR SHOT A
VIDEO OF THE TORNADO.

03:26.105 --> 03:32.679
>> Shawn Rickard: YES, SIR.
UH-HUH.
>> Pelley: THEIR NEIGHBOR TURNED
HIS PHONE TOWARD THE RICKARD

03:32.745 --> 03:38.918
CATTLE FARM AND FRAMED
LIGHTNING-CATCHING HISTORY.
>> Shawn Rickard: BEEN VIEWED
MANY TIMES ON FACEBOOK, I

03:38.985 --> 03:47.660
BELIEVE.
THAT VIDEO IS BASICALLY AS IT'S
HITTING OUR FARM.
>> Pelley: THAT'S "THE BEAST,"

03:47.727 --> 03:55.768
A MILE WIDE, SPINNING
COUNTERCLOCKWISE, AROUND 190
MILES AN HOUR.
SHAWN AND MINDY RICKARD BOLTED

03:55.835 --> 04:04.877
FOR A CHURCH.
WHY DID YOU GO TO THE CHURCH?
WHY NOT STAY IN YOUR BRICK HOME?

04:12.218 --> 04:18.491
>> Shawn Rickard: I GUESS THE
GOOD LORD TOLD US TO LEAVE, AND
WE LEFT.
HE WAS TAKING CARE OF US.

04:18.558 --> 04:24.597
I CAN'T TELL YOU OTHER THAN
THAT.
I DON'T KNOW.
>> Pelley: SEEMS LIKELY, HAD

04:24.664 --> 04:31.337
THEY STAYED, THEY WOULD HAVE
BEEN AMONG AT LEAST 90 DEAD.
NO ONE REMAINS MISSING.
>> Pat Spoden: IT WAS A BEAST OF

04:31.404 --> 04:38.011
A STORM.
IT WAS BIG, IT WAS PERSISTENT,
AND IT WASN'T GOING TO STOP.
NOTHING'S GOING TO STOP THIS

04:38.077 --> 04:44.617
THING.
>> Pelley: HOURS BEFORE THE
STORM, PAT SPODEN WAS ALREADY
WORRIED.

04:44.684 --> 04:51.591
THE 73-DEGREE DAY HIS NEIGHBORS
ENJOYED MADE HIS STOMACH CHURN.
>> Spoden: AND I'VE BEEN DOING
THIS FOR 34 YEARS.

04:51.658 --> 04:58.231
YOU HAVE THAT GUT FEELING, LIKE,
"THIS IS NOT GOOD.
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD
DAY."

04:58.297 --> 05:05.905
>> Pelley: IT WAS TOO WARM FOR
DECEMBER.
SPODEN WAS WORKING THAT NIGHT AT
THE WEATHER SERVICE IN PADUCAH,

05:05.972 --> 05:13.146
KENTUCKY, WHERE HE DREADED THESE
IMAGES OF THE STORM.
WHERE RED MEETS GREEN, THERE IS
ROTATION.

05:13.212 --> 05:22.088
BUT WHAT CAUGHT HIS EYE WAS AN
AREA OF HIGH DENSITY IN THE SKY.
IT WAS DEBRIS, TREES, AND HOMES
AND LIVES, SPIRALING TO

05:22.155 --> 05:30.363
ASTOUNDING HEIGHTS.
>> Spoden: AND IT WAS UP TO
20,000 AND 30,000 FEET.
>> Pelley: THE DEBRIS WAS

05:30.430 --> 05:37.770
REACHING 30,000 FEET, ABOUT
WHERE AIRLINERS FLY?
>> Spoden: YES, YES.
>> Pelley: ON THE SCREEN, SPODEN

05:37.837 --> 05:45.945
SAW THE TWISTER CLOSE IN.
HE KNEW THE TINY WORD "MAYFIELD"
MEANT 10,000 PEOPLE.
HE TYPED THE FIRST TORNADO

05:46.012 --> 05:53.720
EMERGENCY ALERT IN HIS CAREER.
>> Spoden: AND I REMEMBER
SAYING, "I CAN'T SPELL
MAYFIELD," BECAUSE I'M NERVOUS.

05:53.786 --> 06:01.828
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT
IS AT STAKE.
>> Pelley: TORNADO WATCHES AND
WARNINGS HAD BEEN BUZZING PHONES

06:01.894 --> 06:09.602
ALL DAY, BUT, AFTER 9:26 P.M.,
THE WEATHER SERVICE SENT ITS
FINAL WARNING, STARTLING WORDS
IN DIGITAL DEADPAN.

06:09.669 --> 06:17.210
>><i> YOU ARE IN A LIFE-THREATENING</i>
<i>SITUATION.</i>
<i>MOBILE HOMES WILL BE DESTROYED.</i>
<i>CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO HOMES,</i>

06:17.276 --> 06:24.417
<i>BUSINESSES, AND VEHICLES IS</i>
<i>LIKELY, AND COMPLETE</i>
<i>DESTRUCTION IS POSSIBLE.</i>
>> Pelley: IT WAS NEARLY

06:24.484 --> 06:29.789
COMPLETE DESTRUCTION IN HALF OF
MAYFIELD, KENTUCKY.
THIS IS WHERE THE MAYFIELD
CONSUMER PRODUCTS CANDLE FACTORY

06:29.856 --> 06:38.798
WAS DESTROYED.
THE COMPANY SAYS EIGHT DIED, BUT
MORE THAN 100 SURVIVED.
THEY HAD A 22-MINUTE WARNING,

06:38.865 --> 06:50.076
THE TIME TO TAKE COVER.
JUST 90 MILES NORTH OF MAYFIELD,
AND NEARLY 100 YEARS AGO, THE
RECORD FOR THE LONGEST TORNADO

06:50.143 --> 06:58.551
PATH EVER WAS SET IN THE SPRING
OF 1925.
BEFORE RADAR AND WARNINGS,
NEARLY 700 WERE KILLED ALONG A

06:58.618 --> 07:08.661
STRETCH OF 219 MILES.
BACK THEN, GOVERNMENT
FORECASTERS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO
USE THE WORD "TORNADO."

07:08.728 --> 07:14.734
THE TERM WAS CONSIDERED TOO
FRIGHTENING; THE PHENOMENON, TOO
POORLY UNDERSTOOD.
>> Karen Kosiba: YOU NEED TO

07:14.801 --> 07:21.574
LOOK AT OTHER DEBRIS IN THE
AREA, NEARBY DEBRIS, AND SEE IF
DAMAGE IS UNIFORM.
>> Pelley: KAREN KOSIBA IS A

07:21.641 --> 07:29.816
LEADING SCIENTIST WHO HAS
STUDIED TORNADOES FOR 16 YEARS.
HER WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
ILLINOIS USES SOPHISTICATED

07:29.882 --> 07:37.290
RADAR TRUCKS TO SCAN TORNADOES
UP CLOSE AND IN UNPRECEDENTED
DETAIL.
WHAT ARE THE BIG QUESTIONS YOU

07:37.356 --> 07:44.297
WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER ABOUT
TORNADOES?
>> Kosiba: SOME OF IT IS THE
VERY BASIC QUESTION OF WHY SOME

07:44.363 --> 07:49.468
STORMS WILL GO ON TO PRODUCE A
TORNADO AND SOME STORMS WON'T,
EVEN THOUGH THEY LOOK IDENTICAL
ON RADAR, THEY LOOK IDENTICAL TO

07:49.535 --> 07:55.174
THE EYE, THEY LOOK IDENTICAL IN
MODELS.
ALSO, WHAT INTENSITY A TORNADO'S
GOING TO BE.

07:55.241 --> 07:59.712
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY
PREDICTIVE POWER ABOUT HOW
INTENSE THAT TORNADO'S GOING TO
BE, OR HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO

07:59.779 --> 08:05.852
LAST.
>> Pelley: THE UNITED STATES HAS
BY FAR MORE TORNADOES THAN ANY
PLACE ELSE ON EARTH, AND I

08:05.918 --> 08:10.790
WONDER WHY THAT IS.
>> Kosiba: BECAUSE IT HAS
EITHER, I'LL SAY, LUCKY OR
UNLUCKY GEOGRAPHY.

08:10.857 --> 08:20.399
WE HAVE THE GULF OF MEXICO,
WHICH IS AN AMPLE SOURCE OF
MOISTURE THAT HELPS BRING IN
WARM, MOIST AIR AT LOW LEVELS.

08:20.466 --> 08:27.607
WE HAVE THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS,
WHICH ADDS A NICE, COOL LAYER UP
AT SORT OF MID-LEVELS.
AND WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT GIVES

08:27.673 --> 08:37.917
YOU AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE AS
THESE SYSTEMS MOVE THROUGH.
>> Pelley: THIS HAPPENED ON A
73-DEGREE DAY IN DECEMBER, AND I

08:37.984 --> 08:44.857
WONDER WHAT EFFECT DOES CLIMATE
CHANGE HAVE ON THIS?
>> Kosiba: CERTAINLY, WE KNOW
THAT OUR CLIMATE IS WARMING, BUT

08:44.924 --> 08:52.031
HOW THAT ACTUALLY MANIFESTS
ITSELF INTO TORNADO OUTBREAKS OR
TORNADO INTENSITY OR TORNADO
LOCATION IS DIFFICULT TO

08:52.098 --> 08:58.571
DETERMINE.
THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH GOING
ON.
THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT

08:58.638 --> 09:05.344
POTENTIALLY THE TORNADO THREAT
IS MOVING FARTHER EAST THAN IT
NORMALLY IS, OR THAT IT MIGHT BE
OCCURRING LATER IN THE YEAR,

09:05.411 --> 09:11.050
DURING THESE COOL SEASONS.
SO, THESE-- NOVEMBER, DECEMBER,
JANUARY, FEBRUARY, THAT THAT
MIGHT BE MORE PROLIFIC FOR

09:11.117 --> 09:20.826
TORNADOES THAN PREVIOUSLY.
>> Pelley: BUT THE EFFECT OF
CLIMATE CHANGE IS UNCLEAR.
TORNADO FORMATION IS FLEETING,

09:20.893 --> 09:28.100
COMPLEX, AND NOT COMPLETELY
UNDERSTOOD.
2020, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS ONE OF
THE THREE HOTTEST YEARS ON

09:28.167 --> 09:33.940
RECORD, AND IT WAS AN OFF-YEAR
FOR TORNADOES.
THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE

09:34.006 --> 09:38.044
WEATHER?
>> Kosiba: BUT THERE'S A LOT OF
RESEARCH BEING DONE, TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

09:38.110 --> 09:44.850
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE WEATHER.
AND REALLY, I MEAN, THERE'S NO
INDICATION THAT ANY OF THESE
THINGS ARE GOING TO GO AWAY.

09:44.917 --> 09:50.389
SO, I THINK IT'S REALLY WHAT
NEEDS TO BE THE FOCUS IS BEING
PREPARED FOR THESE TYPES OF
EVENTS.

09:50.456 --> 09:57.396
>> Pelley: PREPARATION AND
ADEQUATE WARNING IS NO LONGER
THE PROBLEM; THE WEATHER SERVICE
GETS IT RIGHT NEARLY 90% OF THE

09:57.463 --> 10:05.438
TIME.
ON THIS HILLSIDE OF MOSTLY
MOBILE HOMES, RESIDENTS KNEW IT
WAS COMING, BUT THERE WAS NO

10:05.504 --> 10:13.279
PLACE TO HIDE.
JAMES PENDLEY THREW HIMSELF ON
TOP OF HIS SON.
>> Pendley: I KNEW THINGS WERE

10:13.346 --> 10:22.955
GOING TO START FLYING, SO I
DECIDED THAT MY SON NEEDED TO BE
SHIELDED, BECAUSE HE'S ONLY 20
AND I'M IN MY 50s.

10:23.022 --> 10:28.294
SO, I FIGURE, TWO CHOICES HERE,
HIM OR ME.
AND I FIGURED HE'D BE ONE THAT
NEEDS TO MAKE IT THROUGH THIS.

10:28.361 --> 10:33.399
>> Pelley: YOU'D LIVED YOUR
LIFE.
>> Pendley: I'VE LIVED IT.
I'VE HAD 35 GOOD YEARS WITH HER.

10:33.466 --> 10:41.040
AND I FIGURED IF ANYBODY NEEDED
TO MAKE IT, IT WAS GOING TO BE
HIM.
>> Pelley: TIMMY VANNOY CAME TO

10:41.107 --> 10:47.546
CHECK THE HILL FOR HIS AUNT AND
UNCLE.
HE FOUND MOST EVERY HOME
DESTROYED, AMID SHOUTS OF

10:47.613 --> 10:52.318
MISSING CHILDREN.
>> OVER HERE!
OVER HERE!
>> Timmy Vannoy: OF COURSE, IT'S

10:52.385 --> 10:56.756
PITCH BLACK.
AND A FEW OF THE DEPUTIES AND
ME, WE HAD FLASHLIGHTS, BUT THAT
DIDN'T HELP MUCH.

10:56.822 --> 11:02.261
>><i> 329, CAN YOU GET DOWN HERE?</i>
<i>WE NEED HELP.</i>
<i>WE'VE GOT SOMEBODY UNDER THIS</i>
<i>DEBRIS.</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:08.134
>> Pelley: HE SEARCHED WITH TWO
SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES WHO WERE
WEARING CAMERAS.
>><i> WE'RE LOOKING FOR A 15-MONTH-</i>

11:08.200 --> 11:13.939
<i>OLD.</i>
>> Vannoy: AND SO, WE MOVED ALL
THE DEBRIS OFF THE SHOWER, AND
WE LIFTED THE SHOWER UP.

11:14.006 --> 11:17.743
AND THERE WAS THE LITTLE
15-MONTH-OLD, WAS LAYING THERE,
CRYING.
LITTLE BOY.

11:17.810 --> 11:24.550
>> HEY, BABY!
>> Pelley: DEPUTIES TRENT ARNOLD
AND TROY BLUE DELIVERED THE BOY
INTO THE WORLD AGAIN.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.953
>> HEY, BABY.
HEY.
HI.
OH, MY GOD.

11:28.020 --> 11:37.663
DON'T DROP HIM.
MOVE EASY.
MOVE EASY.
>> Vannoy: AND OVER TO THE SIDE

11:37.730 --> 11:44.403
OF IT WAS-- THEY HAD A LITTLE
THREE-MONTH-OLD THAT-- HE WAS UP
AND UNDER ALL THE DEBRIS, LAYING
ON HIS-- ON HIS BELLY.

11:44.470 --> 11:53.813
>> BOTH OF THEM ARE OKAY.
>> Pelley: THOSE CHILDREN,
EVERYONE ON THE HILL, SURVIVED.
>> JUST GET IN THE CAR WITH HIM.

11:53.879 --> 12:01.153
HERE'S THE LITTLE ONE.
>> Christine Wielgos: YOU SEE
WHERE IT JUST BROKE OFF THE
REBAR OVER HERE.

12:01.220 --> 12:08.761
IT SNAPPED IT LIKE A TOOTHPICK.
>> Pelley: THIS WEEK, THE PATH,
POWER, AND DURATION OF THE BEAST
ARE BEING MEASURED BY TEAMS

12:08.828 --> 12:17.470
INCLUDING THE WEATHER SERVICE'S
PAT SPODEN, CHRISTINE WIELGOS,
AND STEVE EDDY.
IT'S ESTIMATED 15,000 BUILDINGS

12:17.536 --> 12:27.146
WERE SHREDDED ACROSS THE REGION,
AT A COST OF $3.5 BILLION.
>> Spoden: THE INTERESTING POINT
OF THIS THING BEING LOFTED UP

12:27.213 --> 12:32.885
THE HILL AND WHAT KIND OF ENERGY
IT TOOK TO LIFT IT.
>> Pelley: WHAT IMPRESSED THEM
WERE THE SCATTERED RAIL CARS,

12:32.952 --> 12:41.794
TOSSED AND CAPSIZED.
TANK CARS WERE FLARED TO BURN
OFF THE REMAINS OF THEIR
COMBUSTIBLE CARGO.

12:41.861 --> 12:46.832
>> Steve Eddy: NORMALLY, THAT'D
BE A GREAT PLACE TO BE.
I MEAN, YOU'D HAVE GOT CRUSHED
HERE.

12:46.899 --> 12:51.904
>> Pelley: STEVE EDDY WAS AMAZED
THAT THIS UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY
BUILDING COULDN'T STAND UP TO
THE FIGHT.

12:51.971 --> 12:55.708
>> Eddy: THAT'S WHERE I WOULD'VE
TOLD PEOPLE TO GO, TO GO IN AND
SEEK SHELTER.
>> Pelley: BECAUSE IT WAS SO

12:55.774 --> 13:00.813
WELL-BUILT.
>> Wielgos: IT WAS ONLY 18
MONTHS OLD.
>> Pelley: EDDY AND CHRISTINE

13:00.880 --> 13:08.787
WIELGOS TOLD US THAT EVEN WITH
THEIR RADAR AND SUPER COMPUTERS,
THE MOST ACCURATE WAY TO MEASURE
THE POWER OF A TORNADO IS BY

13:08.854 --> 13:15.127
APPRAISING WHAT IS LEFT BEHIND.
>> Wielgos: THE DAY AFTER THE
EVENT, I WAS ABLE TO TAKE A RIDE
IN A HELICOPTER, AND WE FLEW THE

13:15.194 --> 13:21.433
ENTIRE PATH.
WHEN THE HELICOPTER KEPT GOING
AND I KEPT SEEING DAMAGE AND I
KEPT SEEING TREES DOWN, I'M

13:21.500 --> 13:29.275
LIKE, "THIS ISN'T GOING TO END."
>> Eddy: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 1%
TO 2% OF THE TORNADOES THAT
OCCUR, 98% OF THEM ARE ON THE

13:29.341 --> 13:38.517
GROUND FOR ABOUT A MINUTE, AND
ARE ABOUT 100 FEET WIDE.
VERY SHORT, BRIEF, IS A NORMAL
TORNADO.

13:38.584 --> 13:44.456
WIND SPEEDS 70, 80 MILES AN HOUR
MAXIMUM, USUALLY.
>> Pelley: HOW WAS THIS
DIFFERENT?

13:44.523 --> 13:48.928
>> Wielgos: HISTORIC.
>> Eddy: YEAH, HISTORIC.
THAT-- I LIKE THAT WORD.
>> Wielgos: HISTORIC.

13:48.994 --> 13:57.036
>> Eddy: HISTORIC EVENT.
>> Mindy Rickard: THIS IS HOT
PEPPER JELLY.
>> Pelley: HER BRICK HOME

13:57.102 --> 14:05.477
DESTROYED, MINDY RICKARD FOUND
JELLY SHE CANNED IN A GLASS BALL
JAR-- ANOTHER MEMORY FROM WHAT
IS ALREADY BEEN A LONG LIFE WITH

14:05.544 --> 14:11.717
HER HUSBAND, SHAWN.
THEY MET WHEN THEY WERE FOUR
YEARS OLD.
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND THAT HAS

14:11.784 --> 14:20.159
MEANT SOMETHING TO YOU?
>> Shawn Rickard: I'LL LET YOU
TAKE THAT.
>> Mindy Rickard: SO, AS A

14:20.226 --> 14:29.969
FAMILY, WE HAD THREE CHILDREN--
CHLOE, CHASE, AND CALEB.
AND IN 2011, OUR YOUNGEST,
CALEB, PASSED AWAY IN A TRAGIC

14:30.035 --> 14:39.111
SWIMMING POOL ACCIDENT.
>> Pelley: I'M SO SORRY.
>> Mindy Rickard: THERE WAS A
BLANKET THAT ALL THREE OF MY

14:39.178 --> 14:47.219
KIDS USED.
WE USED IT WITH ALL THREE OF
THEM.
BUT CALEB WAS THE ONE WHO JUST

14:47.286 --> 14:54.226
REALLY SEEMED TO LATCH ON TO
THAT BLANKET, AND HE PACKED IT
WITH HIM EVERYWHERE HE WENT.
>> Pelley: CALEB'S BLANKET WAS

14:54.293 --> 15:01.767
FOUND BY A FRIEND ABOUT 150
YARDS AWAY, SOMEHOW STILL
FOLDED.
THE RICKARDS PLAN TO REBUILD ON

15:01.834 --> 15:10.909
THE OLD FOUNDATION.
THE BONFIRE WILL NOT ERASE THE
HISTORY OF THE FAMILY'S THREE
GENERATIONS ON THIS HILL, ROOTS

15:10.976 --> 15:22.021
THAT NOT EVEN A STORM CALLED
"THE BEAST" COULD SEVER.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

15:24.189 --> 15:31.764
>> Bill Whitaker: LOWNDES
COUNTY, ALABAMA, WHICH SITS
BETWEEN SELMA AND MONTGOMERY,
WAS ONCE CALLED "BLOODY LOWNDES"

15:31.830 --> 15:37.169
FOR ITS CENTRAL ROLE IN THE
STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS.
TODAY, PEOPLE IN LOWNDES ARE
FIGHTING FOR ANOTHER BASIC

15:37.236 --> 15:43.409
RIGHT: ACCESS TO SEWAGE
TREATMENT.
BY SOME ESTIMATES, MORE THAN
HALF THE IMPOVERISHED, RURAL

15:43.475 --> 15:48.847
RESIDENTS HAVE RAW SEWAGE
RUNNING INTO THEIR YARDS AND
EVEN THEIR HOUSES.
CATHERINE COLEMAN FLOWERS, A

15:48.914 --> 15:56.088
WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR AND
MacARTHUR GENIUS GRANT
RECIPIENT, IS TURNING A
SPOTLIGHT ON THIS LONG-STANDING

15:56.155 --> 16:03.996
PUBLIC HEALTH FAILURE.
SHE SAYS IT'S A PROBLEM, FOUND
IN OTHER PARTS OF ALABAMA AND
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, WHICH EVEN

16:04.063 --> 16:11.603
THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NEW
INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING ARE
UNLIKELY TO FIX.
FLOWERS BROUGHT US HOME TO

16:11.670 --> 16:19.345
LOWNDES COUNTY TO SEE WHAT SHE
CALLS "AMERICA'S DIRTY SECRET."
WE WARN YOU-- IT CAN BE HARD TO
WATCH.

16:19.411 --> 16:25.617
LOWNDES COUNTY IS IN ONE OF THE
MOST NEGLECTED CORNERS OF THE
COUNTRY.
THE POVERTY RATE IN THIS

16:25.684 --> 16:32.424
MAJORITY-BLACK COUNTY IS DOUBLE
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.
CELL PHONE SERVICE IS A LUXURY,
AND SO, INCREDIBLY, IS SEWAGE

16:32.491 --> 16:40.099
TREATMENT.
LIKE MOST STATES, ALABAMA
REQUIRES SANITARY SEWAGE
DISPOSAL.

16:40.165 --> 16:49.074
BUT OUTSIDE A HANDFUL OF SMALL
TOWNS HERE, SEWAGE TREATMENT IS
NOT PROVIDED, AND FOR MANY
PEOPLE, PRIVATE SYSTEMS, USUALLY

16:49.141 --> 16:57.616
A SEPTIC TANK, ARE UNAFFORDABLE.
(<i> BIRD CHIRPING</i> )
IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS--
ONE COMMUNITY ADVOCATE CATHERINE

16:57.683 --> 17:02.921
COLEMAN FLOWERS HAS BEEN RAISING
HELL ABOUT FOR 20 YEARS.
>> Catherine Coleman Flowers: WE
DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE AN "US"

17:02.988 --> 17:07.326
PROBLEM.
>> Whitaker: IS IT JUST THE
WOODS BEHIND YOUR HOUSE?
>> Coleman Flowers: YES, SIR.

17:07.393 --> 17:15.501
>> Whitaker: SHE TOOK US TO EMMA
SCOTT'S HOME DEEP IN THE WOODS,
WHERE EVEN LIGHT RAIN CAN CREATE
POOLS OF FETID WASTE.

17:15.567 --> 17:20.773
WHEN WE ARRIVED, THE SMELL OF
RAW SEWAGE HUNG HEAVY IN THE
AIR.
THIS IS THE RUNOFF FROM YOUR

17:20.839 --> 17:27.446
HOUSE?
>> Emma Scott: YES, SIR.
>> Whitaker: AND IT JUST EMPTIES
RIGHT INTO THIS LITTLE DRAINAGE

17:27.513 --> 17:32.985
AREA IN YOUR BACKYARD?
>> Scott: YES, SIR.
>> Coleman Flowers: THIS IS
STRAIGHT PIPING.

17:33.051 --> 17:37.990
AND WHEN ONE FLUSHES THE TOILET,
AND IT GOES TO A PIPE, INSTEAD
OF GOING INTO A SEWAGE TREATMENT
PLANT, OR AN ON-SITE SEPTIC

17:38.056 --> 17:45.764
SYSTEM FOR THE SEWAGE TO BE
TREATED, IT JUST ENDS UP ON TOP
OF THE GROUND.
>> Whitaker: I HAVE SEEN THINGS

17:45.831 --> 17:53.639
LIKE THIS IN HAITI, AND PARTS OF
SOUTHEAST ASIA.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THIS IN THE UNITED STATES.

17:53.705 --> 17:58.544
>> Coleman Flowers: THAT'S WHY
WE CALL IT "AMERICA'S DIRTY
SECRET."
>> Whitaker: AND IT'S NOT

17:58.610 --> 18:06.819
SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE HERE CARE
TO TALK ABOUT, ESPECIALLY WITH
OUTSIDERS.
A LITTLE EMBARRASSED, AND A LOT

18:06.885 --> 18:13.192
NERVOUS, SCOTT EXPLAINED TO US
WHY SHE HAS NO PROPER WASTE
DISPOSAL FOR HER MOBILE HOME.
HOW MANY HOURS A WEEK DO YOU

18:13.258 --> 18:19.531
WORK AT THE CHICKEN PLANT?
>> Scott: I WORK EIGHT OR NINE
HOURS, WORK SIX DAYS A WEEK.
>> Whitaker: SO YOU WORK SIX

18:19.598 --> 18:25.838
DAYS A WEEK?
>> Scott: SIX DAYS.
>> Whitaker: AND YOU CAN'T
AFFORD TO PUT IN A SEPTIC TANK?

18:25.904 --> 18:32.411
>> Scott: NO, SIR.
>> Whitaker: SCOTT JUST TOLD US
SHE WAS LAID OFF AFTER TEN YEARS
AT THE CHICKEN PROCESSING PLANT,

18:32.478 --> 18:39.418
DUE TO AUTOMATION.
IT'S EXPENSIVE TO BE POOR IN
LOWNDES.
SEPTIC TANK SYSTEMS CAN COST AS

18:39.485 --> 18:48.627
MUCH AS $25,000.
THAT'S ONE REASON STRAIGHT
PIPING IS SO COMMON AROUND HERE.
BUT THE STATE OF ALABAMA

18:48.694 --> 18:55.534
CONSIDERS THIS A CRIME.
THE STATE SAYS IT'S YOUR
RESPONSIBLITY TO HAVE A SEWAGE
SYSTEM.

18:55.601 --> 19:02.774
>> Scott: I CAN'T AFFORD ANY.
WITH MY INCOME, I CAN'T AFFORD
NO SEPTIC TANK.
>> Whitaker: SO, WHAT, YOU HAVE

19:02.841 --> 19:07.079
NO CHOICE BUT TO BREAK THE LAW?
>> Scott: DON'T HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO BREAK THE LAW.
AND I'M SORRY, BUT I AIN'T GOT

19:07.145 --> 19:18.023
NO CHOICE.
>> Coleman Flowers: IF THIS WAS
A COMMUNITY OF MORE AFFLUENT
PEOPLE, THIS WOULD'VE MADE

19:18.090 --> 19:26.431
HEADLINES 20 YEARS AGO, WHEN I
FIRST STARTED DOING THE WORK.
THE REASON THAT THE SITUATION
HAS CONTINUED FOR SO LONG IS

19:26.498 --> 19:33.171
BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF BENIGN
NEGLECT THAT HAS HAPPENED TO
BLACK COMMUNITIES, POOR
COMMUNITIES, AND RURAL

19:33.238 --> 19:38.043
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES.
>> Whitaker: WHAT I HAVE
WITNESSED THIS WEEK-- IS NOT

19:38.110 --> 19:45.551
BENIGN.
IT'S-- IT'S-- IT'S HORRIBLE.
>> Coleman Flowers: IT<i> IS</i>
HORRIBLE.

19:45.617 --> 19:54.726
BUT THE-- BUT THE NEGLECT IS
OBVIOUS, THAT SOMEWHERE ALONG
THE WAY, THAT THERE'S BEEN A
SERIOUS DISCONNECT, IN TERMS OF

19:54.793 --> 20:01.199
WHO SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO
SANITATION AND WHO SHOULDN'T.
>> Whitaker: WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
TO FOCUS ON THIS PROBLEM?

20:01.266 --> 20:08.073
>> Coleman Flowers: BECAUSE IT'S
SO BASIC.
WE ALL GO TO THE BATHROOM, SO WE
ALL SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO

20:08.140 --> 20:13.879
SANITATION.
I'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT TELL ME,
"OH, IT'S-- IT'S NOT SEXY.
THE MEDIA'S NOT GOING TO BE

20:13.946 --> 20:19.284
INTERESTED IN THAT."
>> Whitaker: IT'S DIFFICULT.
IT'S DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS.
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO COVER.

20:19.351 --> 20:23.522
>> Coleman Flowers: BUT SOMEBODY
HAS TO DO IT.
>> Whitaker: SO THE HOUSE WAS
RIGHT HERE?

20:23.589 --> 20:28.727
>> Coleman Flowers: YES, THE
HOUSE WAS RIGHT HERE.
>> Whitaker: FLOWERS KNOWS ABOUT
THIS PROBLEM FIRSTHAND.

20:28.794 --> 20:34.733
THE 63-YEAR-OLD TOOK US TO THE
SITE OF HER CHILDHOOD HOME.
>> Coleman Flowers: WHEN WE
FIRST MOVED TO LOWNDES COUNTY,

20:34.800 --> 20:41.340
WE DIDN'T HAVE INDOOR PLUMBING,
WE HAD AN OUTHOUSE.
>> Whitaker: SHE SAYS THIS FIGHT
IS ABOUT BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS, A

20:41.406 --> 20:48.847
LONG TRADITION IN LOWNDES
COUNTY.
THE MARCH FROM SELMA TO
MONTGOMERY PASSED THROUGH HERE;

20:48.914 --> 20:54.586
FLOWERS' PARENTS REGISTERED
BLACK VOTERS; THEIR HOME WAS A
MEETING PLACE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS
ACTIVISTS.

20:54.653 --> 20:59.891
DID THEY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SPEAK
UP WHEN YOU SAW SOMETHING WRONG?
>> Coleman Flowers: YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU GROW UP IN A SITUATION

20:59.958 --> 21:03.228
WHERE YOUR PARENTS ARE
CONSTANTLY SPEAKING UP, YOU
DON'T LEARN TO BE QUIET.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

21:03.295 --> 21:08.767
SO...
>> NOW, DONTA, WHAT'S YOUR LAST
NAME?
>> Whitaker: TO MAKE SURE THE

21:08.834 --> 21:14.239
VOICES OF THE MARGINALIZED ARE
HEARD, FLOWERS FOUNDED THE
CENTER FOR RURAL ENTERPRISE AND
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.

21:14.306 --> 21:18.410
SHE HAS TESTIFIED BEFORE
CONGRESS...
>> Coleman Flowers: RURAL
COMMUNITIES SHOULD NO LONGER BE

21:18.477 --> 21:23.749
LEFT BEHIND.
>> Whitaker: ...BROUGHT IN
POLITICIANS, ANYONE SHE THINKS
CAN HELP.

21:23.815 --> 21:31.156
THE STATE DOESN'T KNOW EXACTLY
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THIS
PROBLEM, SO, FLOWERS WENT DOOR-
TO-DOOR IN LOWNDES COUNTY TO TRY

21:31.223 --> 21:39.164
TO FIND OUT.
>> Coleman Flowers: OF THE 3,000
OR SO HOMES THAT WE SURVEYED, AT
LEAST TWO-THIRDS OF THEM HAD

21:39.231 --> 21:44.369
FAILING SYSTEMS, OR NO SYSTEMS
AT ALL.
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
FAILING SYSTEMS AND THE STRAIGHT

21:44.436 --> 21:51.143
PIPE SYSTEMS IS-- ARE THAT THE
STRAIGHT PIPE SYSTEMS TAKE IT
AWAY FROM THE HOME.
WHEN THE SYSTEMS FAIL, IT BRINGS

21:51.209 --> 21:58.050
IT BACK INTO THE HOME.
>> Whitaker: SEPTIC SYSTEMS
OFTEN FAIL BECAUSE OF THE SAME
RICH SOIL THAT MADE THIS REGION

21:58.116 --> 22:05.757
PERFECT FOR GROWING COTTON.
>> Coleman Flowers: THIS IS
CLAY-LIKE.
>> Whitaker: LOOK AT THAT.

22:05.824 --> 22:10.028
SO IT'S HARD FOR WATER TO SEEP
THROUGH?
>> Coleman Flowers: YES.
I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT

22:10.095 --> 22:16.768
LOOKS LIKE PLAY-DOH.
>> Whitaker: THE DENSE SOIL
CAN'T ABSORB LIQUIDS DRAINED
FROM SEPTIC TANKS, CAUSING WASTE

22:16.835 --> 22:24.976
TO POOL IN YARDS AND BACK UP
INTO HOMES.
CHARLIE MAE AND WILLIE HOLCOMBE
SAY RAW SEWAGE HAS FLOODED THEIR

22:25.043 --> 22:32.818
PROPERTY FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS.
>> Charlie Mae Holcombe: ALL
THESE YEARS WE'VE BEEN HERE, MY
KIDS HAVE NEVER-- NAME A YEAR--

22:32.884 --> 22:38.056
BEEN ABLE TO GO OUT THERE AND
PLAY IN THE YARD.
AND EVEN WHEN IT WASN'T FLOODED,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING-- THE

22:38.123 --> 22:41.827
GROUND STAYS SO SOFT, YOU COULD
WALK OUT THERE AND, LIKE, YOU
SINKING.
>> Whitaker: IT'S MUSHY?

22:41.893 --> 22:47.933
>> Charlie Mae Holcombe: YES,
IT'S MUD AND WASTE.
>> Whitaker: THE RETIRED COUPLE
LIVE ON A FIXED INCOME IN

22:47.999 --> 22:58.210
HAYNEVILLE, THE COUNTY SEAT.
INCREDIBLY, THEY PAY MONTHLY
SEWAGE FEES TO HAVE WASTE FROM
THEIR SEPTIC TANK EMPTY INTO

22:58.276 --> 23:03.415
THIS MUNICIPAL LAGOON, ROUGHLY
EIGHT FOOTBALL FIELDS OF SEWAGE.
SO, WHERE'S THE LAGOON?
>> Willie James Holcombe: THE

23:03.482 --> 23:07.052
LAGOON'S ACROSS THE ROAD OVER
THERE.
>> Charlie Mae Holcombe: RIGHT
BEHIND THOSE HOUSES RIGHT THERE.

23:07.119 --> 23:15.594
EVERYBODY SMELLS IT.
I GOT CENTRAL AIR.
YOU CAN HAVE THE WINDOWS DOWN
AND THE CENTRAL AIR ON.

23:15.660 --> 23:19.030
AND THE SMELL WILL WAKE YOU UP.
DID YOU HEAR ME?
>> Whitaker: THE SMELL WILL WAKE
YOU UP.

23:19.097 --> 23:26.238
>> Charlie Mae Holcombe: YES.
>> Whitaker: WHEN IT RAINS, THEY
TELL US, SEWAGE FREQUENTLY BACKS
UP INTO THEIR HOUSE.

23:26.304 --> 23:33.678
CATHERINE FLOWERS ASKED A TEAM
OF DOCTORS TO CHECK OUT THE
UNSANITARY CONDITIONS.
>> Charlie Mae Holcombe: THEY

23:33.745 --> 23:40.252
TESTED MY HUSBAND AND MY
GRANDSON FOR SOME KIND OF
PARASITE.
BOTH OF THEM CAME OUT POSITIVE

23:40.318 --> 23:47.626
WITH IT.
MAN, IT'S LIKE A HORROR MOVIE.
>> Whitaker: IT'S LIKE A HORROR
MOVIE?

23:47.692 --> 23:54.833
>> Charlie Mae Holcombe: A
HORROR MOVIE.
>> Dr. Rojelio Mejia: THE
CONDITIONS WERE VERY SIMILAR TO

23:54.900 --> 24:00.272
VERY POOR COUNTRIES THAT I
TRAVEL TO, IN-- IN-- IN LATIN
AMERICA, AND EVEN AFRICA.
>> Whitaker: DR. ROJELIO MEJIA

24:00.338 --> 24:05.577
IS A TROPICAL DISEASE SPECIALIST
AT BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,
WHO'S STUDIED INFECTIOUS
DISEASES IN 34 COUNTRIES.

24:05.644 --> 24:14.653
HE AND HIS TEAM COLLECTED STOOL
AND SOIL SAMPLES FROM THE
HOLCOMBES AND OTHER RESIDENTS.
USING A P.C.R. TEST-- LIKE THOSE

24:14.719 --> 24:22.894
USED TO DETECT COVID-19-- THEY
FOUND SMALL AMOUNTS OF D.N.A.
FROM HOOKWORMS, A PARASITE THAT
CAN CAUSE STOMACH PROBLEMS,

24:22.961 --> 24:28.133
ANEMIA, AND DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS
IN CHILDREN.
>> Dr. Mejia: SO, OUR STUDY IN
ALABAMA WAS A SMALL STUDY, ABOUT

24:28.200 --> 24:38.109
55 PATIENTS.
AND THE RESULTS WERE, WE FOUND
OVER 30% OF PEOPLE IN AT-RISK
SITUATIONS WITH POOR SANITATION

24:38.176 --> 24:43.682
HAD HOOKWORM.
>> Whitaker: WERE YOU SURPRISED
BY THESE FINDINGS?
>> Dr. Mejia: WE WERE VERY

24:43.748 --> 24:49.855
SHOCKED, AND WE ACTUALLY HAD TO
RUN THE SAMPLE SEVERAL TIMES TO
PROVE TO OURSELVES THAT WE FOUND
THESE NUMBERS.

24:49.921 --> 24:58.029
>> Whitaker: DR. MEJIA'S 2017
FINDINGS ARE CONTROVERSIAL.
HOOKWORM WAS LONG THOUGHT
ERADICATED IN THE U.S.

24:58.096 --> 25:05.604
THE ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
HEALTH COULDN'T CONFIRM MEJIA'S
RESULTS.
THE C.D.C. AND THE UNIVERSITY OF

25:05.670 --> 25:13.144
ALABAMA ARE NOW FOLLOWING UP,
TESTING HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN IN
THE STATE FOR HOOKWORM.
HAVE YOU GONE TO THE COUNTY TO

25:13.211 --> 25:18.116
ASK FOR HELP?
HAVE YOU GONE TO THE STATE?
>> Charlie Mae Holcombe: SIR, I
HAVE BEEN TO THE COUNTY.

25:18.183 --> 25:23.822
I BEEN TO THE BOARD OF
EDUCATION.
I WROTE WASHINGTON, D.C.!
>> Whitaker: WHY DO YOU THINK

25:23.889 --> 25:28.326
NOTHING'S BEEN DONE?
>> Charlie Mae Holcombe: BECAUSE
WE BLACK.
THAT AIN'T NO SECRET.

25:28.393 --> 25:32.497
DO ANY OF Y'ALL REALLY THINK IF
THIS HAD'VE BEEN A WHITE
NEIGHBORHOOD, ALL OF THIS
WOULD'VE WENT ON ALL THESE YEARS

25:32.564 --> 25:40.038
WITH YOUR CHILDREN AROUND HERE?
NO.
OH, JESUS, HAVE MERCY.
MM.

25:40.105 --> 25:49.514
I GET UPSET, EVEN JUST TALKING.
IT'S-- IT'S A MESS.
>> Whitaker: WE TRIED TO FIND
WHO IN ALABAMA IS RESPONSIBLE

25:49.581 --> 25:55.520
FOR FIXING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH
MESS.
LOWNDES COUNTY OFFICIALS TOLD US
THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

25:55.587 --> 26:02.193
THE GOVERNOR AND THE HEAD OF THE
STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
HEALTH DECLINED TO SPEAK WITH
US.

26:02.260 --> 26:07.098
BUT SOMEONE ELSE AT THE
DEPARTMENT DID.
SHERRY BRADLEY'S OFFICE
REGULATES SEPTIC SYSTEMS IN

26:07.165 --> 26:14.673
RURAL AREAS, AMONG OTHER THINGS.
SHE SAID IT'S NOT THE
DEPARTMENT'S JOB TO BUILD
INFRASTRUCTURE.

26:14.739 --> 26:19.244
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?
>> Sherry Bradley: I CAN TELL
YOU WHO'S NOT RESPONSIBLE, AND
THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

26:19.311 --> 26:25.050
HEALTH.
WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE.
>> Whitaker: BUT, THE U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS SOME

26:25.116 --> 26:33.058
QUESTIONS.
LAST MONTH, JUST DAYS AFTER WE
SPOKE WITH BRADLEY, THE D.O.J.
LAUNCHED AN UNPRECEDENTED CIVIL

26:33.124 --> 26:39.731
RIGHTS INVESTIGATION INTO
WHETHER THE ALABAMA DEPARTMENT
OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST BLACK

26:39.798 --> 26:44.069
RESIDENTS IN LOWNDES, DENYING
THEM ACCESS TO PROPER
SANITATION.
>> SO, EVERY SO OFTEN, IT

26:44.135 --> 26:49.808
OVERFLOWS?
>> YES.
>> Whitaker: THE DEPARTMENT SAYS
IT'S COOPERATING.

26:49.874 --> 26:58.783
WE COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE STATE
PROGRAM DEVOTED TO REMEDYING THE
SEWAGE PROBLEM IN RURAL AREAS.
THIS YEAR, SHERRY BRADLEY

26:58.850 --> 27:06.624
STARTED A PILOT PROJECT ON HER
OWN, SEEKING OUTSIDE GRANTS AND
DONATIONS FOR SEPTIC TANK
SYSTEMS THAT CAN WORK IN THE

27:06.691 --> 27:13.431
SOIL HERE.
THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE
HEALTH DEPARTMENT COUGHED UP
ABOUT $450,000.

27:13.498 --> 27:18.636
SO, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
>> Bradley: BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE
STEPPED FORWARD.
THAT'S THE REASON I'M DOING IT.

27:18.703 --> 27:24.843
>> Whitaker: THIS IS NOT
TECHNICALLY A STATE-FUNDED
PROJECT?
>> Bradley: IT'S NOT EVEN-- IT'S

27:24.909 --> 27:31.316
NOT EVEN A STATE PROJECT.
IT'S STATE-SUPPORTED.
I HAVE-- (<i> LAUGHS</i> )
I HAVE BEGGED MONEY FROM A WHOLE

27:31.383 --> 27:37.322
LOT OF PEOPLE.
>> Whitaker: THIS IS A BIG
PROBLEM.
WHY IS THE STATE NOT TAKING THE

27:37.389 --> 27:43.595
REINS ON THIS, TO SOLVE A
STATEWIDE PROBLEM?
>> Bradley: I DON'T KNOW.
>> Whitaker: WOULD YOU LIKE THE

27:43.661 --> 27:50.001
STATE TO STEP IN AND SOLVE THIS
PROBLEM?
>> Bradley: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
LOWNDES COUNTY, THE PEOPLE

27:50.068 --> 27:54.339
THERE, THE MAJORITY, SAY, "I'M
NOT GOING TO PUT SEWAGE ON THE
GROUND.
I RATHER PUT A OUTHOUSE OUT

27:54.406 --> 27:58.476
THERE."
>> Whitaker: SO THESE PEOPLE
SHOULD PUT UP OUTHOUSES?
>> Bradley: YEAH.

27:58.543 --> 28:08.453
THEY CAN, AND IT'S APPROVED.
>> Whitaker: YOU DO KNOW THIS IS
2021?
>> Bradley: IT'S 2021, BUT, DO

28:08.520 --> 28:12.824
YOU WANT SEWAGE ON THE GROUND,
OR WOULD YOU RATHER DISPOSE OF
IT PROPERLY?
UNTIL I CAN GET TO YOU WITH A

28:12.891 --> 28:17.262
SYSTEM, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH A OUTHOUSE.
>> Whitaker: COULD YOU HANDLE
EVERYBODY IN THE STATE WHO NEEDS

28:17.328 --> 28:24.469
HELP?
>> Bradley: NO.
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT, AND NOT--
AND NOT WORK MY JOB.

28:24.536 --> 28:31.576
>> Whitaker: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO
PEOPLE WHO SAY, "JUST CLEAN IT
UP.
WHY DO YOU LIVE LIKE THIS"?

28:31.643 --> 28:39.651
>> Scott: WE JUST TRY.
DID THE BEST YOU COULD.
THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL THEM.
I DO THE BEST I COULD.

28:39.717 --> 28:49.427
>> Whitaker: YOU FEEL FORGOTTEN?
>> Scott: YES, SIR.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

28:50.628 --> 29:00.405
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> Lesley Stahl: LOOK ACROSS THE
LANDSCAPE OF LATE-NIGHT
TELEVISION, AND YOU'LL SEE THAT

29:00.472 --> 29:08.279
MOST OF THE HOSTS ARE WHITE MEN
IN THEIR 40s AND 50s.
NOT TREVOR NOAH.
HE'S BI-RACIAL, HE'S NOT

29:08.346 --> 29:16.855
AMERICAN, AND HE'S ONLY 37.
BUT HE'S A CERTIFIED CELEBRITY
WITH A GLOBAL FOLLOWING, WHO HAS
BROUGHT AN INTERNATIONAL

29:16.921 --> 29:24.262
DIMENSION TO COMEDY CENTRAL'S
"THE DAILY SHOW."
HE'S FROM SOUTH AFRICA, WHERE HE
GREW UP UNDER APARTHEID.

29:24.329 --> 29:32.670
HE CALLED HIS MEMOIR "BORN A
CRIME," BECAUSE IT WAS ILLEGAL
FOR A BLACK WOMAN, LIKE HIS
MOTHER, AND A WHITE MAN, LIKE

29:32.737 --> 29:41.112
HIS FATHER, TO MIX.
TREVOR SAYS HE ALWAYS FELT LIKE
AN OUTSIDER, BUT HIS HUMOR--
MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH-- HAS BEEN

29:41.179 --> 29:51.990
HIS TICKET TO BELONGING.
TREVOR NOAH IS BACK ON TOUR WITH
HIS COMEDY SHOW IN A DIFFERENT
CITY PRACTICALLY EVERY WEEKEND.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.759
>> Trevor Noah: YEAH, LIKE, WHEN
YOU'RE IN TEXAS, THEY'D BE,
LIKE, "YOU GOT ANY WEAPONS IN
THE VEHICLE?"

29:54.826 --> 29:59.097
YOU'RE LIKE, "NO, SIR."
THEY'RE LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, HERE'S
ONE, HERE YOU GO."
(<i> LAUGHTER</i> )

29:59.164 --> 30:08.540
"YOU ALL HAVE A GOOD NIGHT NOW."
>> Stahl: HE LOVES OWNING THE
STAGE, THE ROAR OF THE BIG
CROWD, TYPICALLY 15,000 IN GIANT

30:08.606 --> 30:18.082
ARENAS LIKE THIS ONE IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
>> Noah: OKAY, EVERYBODY, HERE
WE GO, WE'RE ABOUT TO START

30:18.149 --> 30:23.855
TAPING OUR MONOLOGUE.
>> Stahl: IT'S A FAR CRY FROM
HIS MORE-CONFINED TV STUDIO DAY
JOB ON "THE DAILY SHOW," WHERE

30:23.922 --> 30:27.892
HE HAD A SHAKY START WHEN HE
TOOK OVER SIX YEARS AGO FROM JON
STEWART.
>> Noah: AND NOW IT FEELS LIKE

30:27.959 --> 30:34.933
THE FAMILY HAS A NEW STEP DAD,
AND HE'S BLACK...
>> Stahl: WAS IT A GOOD
DECISION?

30:34.999 --> 30:41.072
>> Noah: TERRIBLE, INITIALLY.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Stahl: AWFUL.
>> Noah: DON'T TAKE "THE DAILY

30:41.139 --> 30:44.142
SHOW," LESLEY, WHEN THEY OFFER
IT TO YOU.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TAKE "THE
DAILY SHOW"!

30:44.209 --> 30:47.345
>> Stahl: WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
BEGINNING?
>> Noah: OH, I MEAN, EVERYBODY
HATED ME.

30:47.412 --> 30:50.915
PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ME, AND
THEY HATED THE IDEA OF ME.
>> Stahl: BUT YOU DID HAVE A
SAVIOR.

30:50.982 --> 30:57.589
DONALD TRUMP.
>> Noah: ONCE YOU REALIZE THAT
TRUMP IS BASICALLY THE PERFECT
AFRICAN PRESIDENT, YOU START TO

30:57.655 --> 31:02.160
NOTICE THE SIMILARITIES
EVERYWHERE.
>> Stahl: ONCE HE FOUND HIS
FOIL...

31:02.227 --> 31:11.035
>> Noah: THE SECRET DOCUMENT--
>> Stahl: ...HIS RATINGS BEGAN
TO IMPROVE, AND HE REALIZED HE
COULD CONNECT AMERICAN POLITICS

31:11.102 --> 31:17.875
TO HIS BACKGROUND IN SOUTH
AFRICA.
HE GREW UP IN JOHANNESBURG AND
ITS BLACK TOWNSHIP OF SOWETO

31:17.942 --> 31:27.685
DURING THE STRICT RACIAL
SEPARATION REGIME OF APARTHEID.
HE ALWAYS FELT LIKE AN OUTSIDER,
NOT QUITE BLACK LIKE HIS XHOSA

31:27.752 --> 31:34.525
MOTHER, NOT QUITE WHITE LIKE HIS
SWISS FATHER, WHO HE HAS SEEN
INFREQUENTLY IN HIS LIFE.
TO BE WITH YOUR FATHER, WHO WAS

31:34.592 --> 31:38.896
WHITE, THAT WAS A CRIME.
>> Noah: YEAH.
THIS WAS THE LAW THAT FORBADE
ANYBODY OF DIFFERENT RACES FROM

31:38.963 --> 31:45.803
MIXING.
>> Stahl: THERE'S SOMETHING I
HEARD-- I'M NOT SURE I BELIEVE
IT-- BUT, YOUR GRANDFATHER USED

31:45.870 --> 31:49.340
TO CALL YOU MASTER?
>> Noah: YEAH.
>> Stahl: BECAUSE OF THE COLOR
OF YOUR SKIN?

31:49.407 --> 31:53.311
>> Noah: THAT'S HOW HE REFERRED
TO ME.
"MASTER."
AND HE'D ALWAYS FORCED ME TO SIT

31:53.378 --> 31:58.182
IN THE BACK OF THE CAR.
BE LIKE, "MASTER."
"WHAT CAN THE POLICE SAY IF I
SAY THE MASTER IS SITTING WITH

31:58.249 --> 32:03.655
ME?"
>> Stahl: YOUR PARENTS, YOUR
GRANDMOTHER PARTICULARLY, WAS
ALWAYS AFRAID THE POLICE WERE

32:03.721 --> 32:08.526
GOING TO COME AND FIND YOU.
WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF THEY
FOUND YOU?
>> Noah: I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE

32:08.593 --> 32:11.996
BEEN TAKEN AWAY TO AN ORPHANAGE.
>> Stahl: NO.
>> Noah: YEAH.
>> Stahl: YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS

32:12.063 --> 32:16.100
ALWAYS HIDING YOU.
>> Noah: YES.
>> Stahl: YOU WERE IN LOCKDOWN.
>> Noah: RIGHT.

32:16.167 --> 32:24.776
I WAS IN PANDEMIC BEFORE
PANDEMIC EVEN EXISTED.
>> Stahl: BUT YOU WERE POOR.
YOU WRITE IN YOUR BOOK ABOUT

32:24.842 --> 32:33.318
EATING WORMS, AND HAVING A TOY
THAT WAS A BRICK.
>> Noah: HERE'S THE THING THAT I
ALWAYS SAY TO PEOPLE: BEING POOR

32:33.384 --> 32:42.060
IN A GROUP OR IN A COMMUNITY
THAT IS POOR, IS NOT AS BAD AS
BEING POOR WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON.

32:42.126 --> 32:48.433
SO WHEN I GREW UP, WE PLAYED
WITH BRICKS AS CARS, AND YOU'D
SMASH THEM INTO EACH OTHER, AND
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST FUN GAMES

32:48.499 --> 32:53.104
I'VE EVER PLAYED.
THE SAME THING WITH EATING
MOPANE WORMS.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE WAS WHEN WE

32:53.171 --> 32:57.342
COULDN'T EAT ANYTHING ELSE, AND
MY MOM SAID, "WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO EAT THESE MOPANE WORMS
FOR LONGER BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

32:57.408 --> 33:05.817
MONEY TO BUY CHICKEN."
>> Stahl: SPENDING TIME INDOORS,
HE BECAME A VORACIOUS READER.
HE WROTE ABOUT HIS MOTHER,

33:05.883 --> 33:12.490
PATRICIA NOAH IN HIS MEMOIR,
"BORN A CRIME," SAYING SHE
RAISED HIM ALMOST AS IF HE WAS
WHITE, WITH NO LIMITATIONS ON

33:12.557 --> 33:20.365
WHAT HE COULD ACHIEVE.
HE WROTE, IT WAS JUST THE TWO OF
THEM-- HIM AND HIS MOM-- AGAINST
THE WORLD.

33:20.431 --> 33:27.538
BUT THEN, SHE MARRIED A MAN
NAMED ABEL, WHO HE SAID BEAT UP
HIS MOTHER, THEN SHOT HER, IN
THE HEAD.

33:27.605 --> 33:35.513
>> Noah: THE HEAD BULLET DIDN'T
HIT ANYTHING VITAL-- OTHER THAN
THE HEAD, OBVIOUSLY-- BUT IT
MISSED HER SPINAL CORD, MISSED

33:35.580 --> 33:42.019
THE NERVES.
DIDN'T TOUCH THE BRAIN.
AND ALL IT DID WAS IT CUT A
PIECE OF HER NOSTRIL OFF.

33:42.086 --> 33:46.657
JUST, JUST ONE SIDE, AND THE
BULLET WENT OUT CLEAN.
AND MY MOM LOOKS AT ME AND SHE
GOES, "SHH, TREVOR, TREVOR,

33:46.724 --> 33:51.062
DON'T CRY, BABY."
I SAID, "NO MOM, I'M GOING TO
CRY.
YOU WERE SHOT IN THE HEAD."

33:51.129 --> 33:57.268
SHE SAYS, "NO, NO, NO LOOK ON
THE BRIGHT SIDE."
I SAID, "WHAT BRIGHT SIDE?"
SHE SAYS, "NO, AT LEAST NOW

33:57.335 --> 34:04.575
BECAUSE OF MY NOSE, YOU'RE
OFFICIALLY THE BEST-LOOKING
PERSON IN THE FAMILY."
>> Stahl: YOU DID SAY, YOU HAD

34:04.642 --> 34:09.680
THE BLACK WORLD AND YOU HAD THE
WHITE WORLD, AND-- THIS IS A
QUOTE FROM YOU-- "ALL I WANTED
TO DO WAS BELONG."

34:09.747 --> 34:14.318
>> Noah: EVERYBODY WANTS TO
BELONG.
HALF OF OUR FIGHTS IN LIFE ARE
BECAUSE WE WANT TO BELONG.

34:14.385 --> 34:20.224
AND SO I GREW UP IN A COUNTRY
WHERE I WAS TOLD THAT YOUR
BELONGING WAS DEFINED BY THE
SHADE OF-- THE COLOR OF YOUR

34:20.291 --> 34:25.763
SKIN.
AND THAT NEVER WORKED FOR ME.
YOU KNOW?
I FOUND, MY GREATEST JOY WAS

34:25.830 --> 34:31.769
WITH THE PEOPLE WHERE WE SHARED
INTERESTS, AND THE WAY WE SPOKE,
AND THE WAY WE LAUGHED.
ET CETERA.

34:31.836 --> 34:39.944
SO I ALWAYS WANTED TO BELONG.
AND-- AND THAT-- THAT, I THINK,
HAS BEEN A GIFT AND A CURSE IN
LIFE.

34:40.011 --> 34:45.316
>> Stahl: I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING
THAT YOU DID BELONG, BECAUSE YOU
WERE FUNNY.
>> Noah: FUNNY IS SOMETHING THAT

34:45.383 --> 34:52.457
I DEVELOPED AS A TOOL, YEAH, TO
BELONG.
>> Stahl: HE WAS FUNNY BACK IN
JOHANNESBURG, BUT BECAME A

34:52.523 --> 34:59.997
PROFESSIONAL COMEDIAN BY
ACCIDENT, WHEN HE WAS 22 AND
TOOK THE STAGE AT A COMEDY CLUB
ON A DARE FROM HIS COUSIN.

35:00.064 --> 35:03.935
>> Noah: YEAH, YOU LAUGH, BUT
IT'S TRUE BECAUSE I'M, LIKE,
MIXED, YOU KNOW?
I'VE GOT A PERCENTAGE SHARE.

35:04.001 --> 35:11.909
IT'S THAT TYPE OF THING.
>> Stahl: HE KILLED IT, GAVE UP
HIS PLAN TO GO TO COLLEGE, AND
SOON WAS TOURING ALL OVER THE

35:11.976 --> 35:20.518
WORLD AS A STAND-UP COMIC.
ACCORDING TO FORBES, HE'S ONE OF
THE HIGHEST-PAID COMEDIANS
TODAY.

35:20.585 --> 35:25.490
HE FIRST STARTED TOURING THE
UNITED STATES IN 2011.
AND A YEAR LATER?
>> Noah: FROM THE TIME I WAS A

35:25.556 --> 35:31.796
YOUNG CHILD, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
ONE THING-- AND THAT IS, I'VE
ALWAYS WANTED TO BE BLACK.
>> Stahl: HE WAS ON "THE TONIGHT

35:31.863 --> 35:37.668
SHOW" AND CAUGHT THE ATTENTION
OF JON STEWART'S PRODUCER AT
"THE DAILY SHOW," A VIACOM-CBS
PROPERTY.

35:37.735 --> 35:45.543
WHEN HE WAS EVENTUALLY OFFERED
THE HOST CHAIR, HE SAID IT WOULD
HAVE MEANT TAKING A PAY CUT AND
GIVING UP HIS LIFE ON THE ROAD.

35:45.610 --> 35:51.516
SO, STEWART HAD TO TALK HIM INTO
IT.
>> Noah: HE SAID, "I'M NOT
OFFERING YOU THE GLITZ AND GLAM

35:51.582 --> 35:56.988
OF YOUR LIFE.
I'M OFFERING YOU A HOME FOR A
WHILE, THAT I THINK YOU'LL COME
TO ENJOY."

35:57.054 --> 36:01.492
THAT INTRIGUED ME.
I WAS LIKE, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO HAVE A HOME.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BELONG.

36:01.559 --> 36:07.431
AND SO, I THOUGHT, "WELL, THIS
COULD BE THE-- THIS COULD BE THE
CHANCE."
>> Stahl: AND THE CHANCE TO

36:07.498 --> 36:16.974
WEIGH IN ON SERIOUS TOPICS.
WHEN COVID HIT AND HE WAS
BROADCASTING FROM HIS APARTMENT,
NEARLY 11 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED

36:17.041 --> 36:22.346
HIS MONOLOGUE ON RACE AND GEORGE
FLOYD.
>> Noah: THERE WAS A BLACK MAN
ON THE GROUND IN HANDCUFFS, AND

36:22.413 --> 36:28.886
YOU-- YOU COULD TAKE HIS LIFE,
SO YOU DID.
ALMOST KNOWING THAT THERE WOULD
BE NO RAMIFICATIONS.

36:28.953 --> 36:35.660
>> Stahl: AND IT WASN'T FUNNY.
AND NOW WE HAVE A NEW DIMENSION
TO TREVOR.
>> Noah: I GUESS.

36:35.726 --> 36:38.896
I GUESS YOU'VE SEEN A DIFFERENT
DIMENSION TO TREVOR.
I'VE ALWAYS HAD THE DIFFERENT
DIMENSION.

36:38.963 --> 36:43.601
>> Stahl: WELL.
YOU SHOWED IT TO THE PUBLIC.
>> Noah: THAT-- THAT'S TRUE.
>> Stahl: SOME OF THE FUNNIEST

36:43.668 --> 36:51.475
PEOPLE WE KNOW ON THE PLANET
HAVE DEPRESSION.
YOU COME TO MIND.
>> Noah: WELL, I THINK, OVER THE

36:51.542 --> 36:58.449
YEARS, WHAT I'VE COME TO LEARN,
THANKS TO SOME GREAT THERAPISTS,
IS, MY DEPRESSION IS CREATED BY
A SEVERE LEVEL OF A.D.H.D.

36:58.516 --> 37:03.988
>> Stahl: A.D.H.D. LOOKS LIKE
DEPRESSION?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> Noah: SO, IT CAN BE DIFFERENT

37:04.055 --> 37:11.529
FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
I'M NOT-- YOU KNOW?
BUT, LIKE, SO, FOR MYSELF, IT
MEANS THAT IF I'M NOT CAREFUL IN

37:11.596 --> 37:18.736
HOW I SLEEP, HOW I EAT, HOW I--
HOW I MANAGE MY ROUTINE, I CAN
BECOME OVERWHELMED, AND IT CAN
JUST FEEL LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD

37:18.803 --> 37:27.612
IS JUST TOO HEAVY TO BEAR.
>> Stahl: YOU SAID SOMETHING
THAT STICKS WITH ME.
YOU SAID IT WASN'T UNTIL YOU

37:27.678 --> 37:32.617
CAME TO THE UNITED STATES THAT
REAL HATE STARTED COMING AT YOU.
>> Noah: OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY.
>> Stahl: WHAT WAS THE HATE THAT

37:32.683 --> 37:37.755
YOU FELT?
ANY-- DID THE COPS EVER STOP
YOU?
>> Noah: I'VE BEEN PULLED OVER

37:37.822 --> 37:41.659
QUITE FREQUENTLY BY THE COPS,
YEAH.
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS, DAVID
MEYER, YOU KNOW?

37:41.726 --> 37:46.797
WE'D DRIVE ALL OVER THE WEST
COAST TO THESE COMEDY SHOWS.
IF I WAS DRIVING, WE WOULD GET
PULLED OVER.

37:46.864 --> 37:49.333
AND THEN HE WOULD DRIVE--
>> Stahl: AND IF HE WAS DRIVING?
>> Noah: WE WOULDN'T GET PULLED
OVER.

37:49.400 --> 37:53.638
>> Stahl: BUT YOU DID SAY YOU
EXPERIENCED HATE.
>> Noah: YES, BUT, I MEAN,
THAT'S-- THAT'S "WELCOME TO

37:53.704 --> 38:01.012
AMERICA," YOU KNOW.
>> Stahl: OOH... THAT'S HARSH.
>> Noah: YEAH.
THERE'S A LOT OF HATE IN

38:01.078 --> 38:04.815
AMERICA, BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT
OF ANGER IN AMERICA.
>> Stahl: HOW IS IT CHANGING
YOU?

38:04.882 --> 38:09.687
>> Noah: FOR ME, I'M ALWAYS
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, HOW DO I
SPEAK TO SOMEBODY WHO HATES ME?
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE FOR NOW.

38:09.754 --> 38:15.292
>> Stahl: BECAUSE OF HIS
CHILDHOOD, GROWING UP BETWEEN
TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS, HE TENDS
TO SEE BOTH SIDES OF AN

38:15.359 --> 38:22.667
ARGUMENT.
TAKE HIS REACTION TO THE TROUBLE
HIS FRIEND, COMEDIAN DAVE
CHAPPELLE, GOT IN OVER HIS

38:22.733 --> 38:28.572
NETFLIX SPECIAL, "THE CLOSER."
>> Dave Chappelle: WE BLACKS WE
LOOK AT THE GAY COMMUNITY...
>> Stahl: THAT WAS CRITICIZED AS

38:28.639 --> 38:32.777
HOMOPHOBIC, TRANSPHOBIC AND
MISOGYNISTIC.
IN YOUR MIND, DID HE CROSS THE
LINE?

38:32.843 --> 38:35.846
>> Noah: DID DAVE CHAPPELLE
CROSS THE LINE?
YES.
NO.

38:35.913 --> 38:41.786
IT IMMEDIATELY PUTS ME IN A
POSITION WHERE I HAVE TO CHOOSE
A SIDE, WHEN I THINK THAT THE
MATTER IS A LOT MORE COMPLEX

38:41.852 --> 38:46.524
THAN THAT.
I THINK EVERYBODY IS DEFINING
THE LINE FOR THEMSELVES.
>> Stahl: NO.

38:46.590 --> 38:52.596
SOCIETY DEFINES THE LINE.
>> Noah: YOU SEE, WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING NOW IS, YOU'RE SAYING
SOCIETY HAS DECIDED.

38:52.663 --> 38:58.035
IN THAT, HALF OF SOCIETY HASED,
GONE, LIKE, "NO, DAVE CHAPPELLE,
WE LOVE WHAT YOU SAID.
WE'RE SICK OF WOKENESS.

38:58.102 --> 39:03.140
WE'RE SICK OF PEOPLE BEING TOLD
WHAT TO SAY.
WE'RE SICK OF NOT KNOWING HOW TO
USE THE RIGHT PRONOUN.

39:03.207 --> 39:08.112
YOU'RE RIGHT, DAVE CHAPPELLE."
SO THEN, IF HALF OF SOCIETY IS
SAYING DAVE CHAPPELLE IS RIGHT,
AND HALF OF SOCIETY IS SAYING

39:08.179 --> 39:15.720
THAT HE'S WRONG, THEN THAT MEANS
THERE<i> IS</i> NO LINE.
IT MEANS SOCIETY IS SEEING THE
LINE FROM TWO DIFFERENT SIDES.

39:15.786 --> 39:19.990
AND SO, THAT'S WHY I SAY YOU
CANNOT SAY "DID HE CROSS THE
LINE," BECAUSE WHICH SIDE ARE
YOU LOOKING AT THE LINE FROM

39:20.057 --> 39:23.060
DEFINES WHETHER OR NOT HE
CROSSED IT.
>> Stahl: ARE YOU STILL LEARNING
THINGS ALL THE TIME?

39:23.127 --> 39:27.465
>> Noah: YES.
YES.
>> Stahl: WELL, HE'S HAD TO
LEARN ABOUT NEW YORK CITY, HIS

39:27.531 --> 39:35.506
NEW HOME SINCE 2015-- BUY AN
APARTMENT HERE, MAKE NEW
FRIENDS...
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR

39:35.573 --> 39:39.777
PERSONAL LIFE FOR A MINUTE.
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN?
>> Noah: I-- I GO BACK AND
FORTH.

39:39.844 --> 39:47.318
SOMETIMES I WILL MEET KIDS WHO
MAKE ME GO, "I WANT A KID."
AND THEN SOMETIMES I'LL MEET
CHILDREN WHERE I GO, "I HOPE

39:47.384 --> 39:51.655
THAT MY SPERM DOESN'T DO
ANYTHING, BECAUSE THIS PERSON IS
A TERROR."
>> Stahl: YOU'RE 37.

39:51.722 --> 39:54.692
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S THE CLOCK.
IT'S TICKING.
>> Noah: OKAY.

39:54.759 --> 39:58.062
>> Stahl: BUT YOU DON'T FEEL IT?
>> Noah: NO, I DON'T.
>> Stahl: YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
NOW?

39:58.129 --> 40:04.969
>> Noah: MAYBE.
>> Stahl: WELL, I READ "PAGE
SIX" LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS
WORLD.

40:05.035 --> 40:08.072
>> Noah: OH, LESLEY.
OH, THE TABLOIDS.
>> Stahl: THE TABLOIDS--
>> Noah: NO.

40:08.139 --> 40:12.443
>> Stahl: YOU DON'T LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIENDS?
>> Noah: NO.
>> Stahl: WHAT IS TREVOR LIKE

40:12.510 --> 40:16.647
WITH HIS GIRLFRIENDS?
>> Noah: IT'S A TRICK.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT
QUESTION.

40:16.714 --> 40:24.722
>> Stahl: TREVOR INTRODUCED US
TO COMEDY PRODUCER RYAN HARDUTH
AND COMEDIAN DAVID KIBUUKA, NOW
A SUPERVISING PRODUCER ON "THE

40:24.789 --> 40:28.759
DAILY SHOW."
THEY'RE AMONG HIS OLDEST FRIENDS
FROM SOUTH AFRICA.
>> Noah: NO.

40:28.826 --> 40:31.996
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ANY
QUESTIONS ABOUT PERSONAL--
>> David Kibuuka: REALLY?
>> Noah: --RELATIONSHIPS.

40:32.062 --> 40:34.598
>> Stahl: WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
>> Noah: OKAY, WHAT IS MITCH
McCONNELL LIKE WITH HIS
GIRLFRIENDS?

40:34.665 --> 40:37.568
DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT
QUESTION?
>> Kibuuka: I DON'T KNOW.
>> Noah: EXACTLY.

40:37.635 --> 40:40.538
>> Kibuuka: BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
ANSWER IT.
>> Noah: BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN
ASK HIM.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.741
>> Kibuuka: AND ALSO BECAUSE
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
THIS IS WHAT I'LL SAY ABOUT
TREVOR WITH HIS GIRLFRIENDS, IS

40:43.808 --> 40:46.043
THAT--
>> Noah: SO YOU'RE JUST FULLY
GOING AHEAD WITH THIS?
>> Kibuuka: YEAH.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.679
YES.
>> Stahl: OF COURSE HE IS.
>> Noah: WOW.
OKAY.

40:48.746 --> 40:54.018
>> Stahl: OF COURSE HE IS.
>> Kibuuka: --IS THAT HE IS
VERY, VERY-- LIKE, A GREAT
BOYFRIEND.

40:54.084 --> 41:03.194
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Stahl: SO WHAT ARE THE
QUALITIES THAT YOU LIKE MOST
ABOUT TREVOR?

41:03.260 --> 41:10.401
>> Ryan Harduth: HE'S A GREAT
BOYFRIEND.
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
>> Stahl: TREVOR TOLD US HE

41:10.467 --> 41:18.108
HANGS OUT WITH THESE GUYS OFTEN,
AND HE TALKS WITH HIS MOTHER
EVERY DAY-- THINGS, HE SAYS,
THAT KEEP HIM GROUNDED.

41:18.175 --> 41:21.745
IS HE A PERFECTIONIST?
>> Harduth: NO.
YEAH, I WOULDN'T SAY HE IS A
PERFECTIONIST.

41:21.812 --> 41:24.548
>> Stahl: NO?
WORKAHOLIC?
>> Kibuuka: YES.
>> Harduth: YES.

41:24.615 --> 41:29.820
I WOULD SAY SO.
>> Kibuuka: 100%.
HE SURE IS.
>> Stahl: EVEN THOUGH HE DOES

41:29.887 --> 41:35.993
"THE DAILY SHOW" DURING THE
WEEK, AND HE'LL BE HOSTING THE
GRAMMYS ON CBS AGAIN IN JANUARY,
HE REFUSES TO GIVE UP HIS COMEDY

41:36.060 --> 41:42.099
SHOWS.
>> Noah: GENUINELY, I JUST LOVE
THE FEELING OF A LAUGH.
I THINK-- I THINK WHEN WE LAUGH

41:42.166 --> 41:47.037
AS HUMAN BEINGS, THAT'S WHEN
WE'RE-- WE'RE OUR MOST AUTHENTIC
SELVES.
THAT'S WHY YOUR REAL LAUGH IS SO

41:47.104 --> 41:51.876
UGLY.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S NOT FILTERED IN ANY WAY.
IT'S-- (<i> LAUGHS</i> )

41:51.942 --> 41:59.016
I LOVE THAT.
IT'S, LIKE, PURE JOY.
FORGET WHAT PEOPLE THINK.
JUST LAUGH, YOU KNOW?

41:59.083 --> 42:03.287
WE NEED IT.
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
(<i> TICKING</i> )

42:05.990 --> 42:10.661
>><i> WATCH TREVOR NOAH AND HIS</i>
<i>TEAM WRITE A "DAILY SHOW" JOKE,</i>

42:19.403 --> 42:27.111
>> Whitaker: IN DARK DAYS, IT
CAN BE HELPFUL TO REMEMBER THAT
BRIGHTER TIMES ARE ON THE WAY.
THIS YEAR, WITH MORE THAN ITS

42:27.177 --> 42:34.818
SHARE OF NATURAL DISASTERS,
$4 GAS, EVER-EVOLVING PANDEMIC
VARIANTS, AND POLITICAL TURMOIL,
IT MAY NOT BE EASY TO SEE

42:34.885 --> 42:41.659
BRIGHTER DAYS EMERGING FROM THE
SHADOWS.
TAKE A PAUSE TUESDAY MORNING
JUST BEFORE 11:00 A.M.

42:41.725 --> 42:48.699
LOOK UP AT THE SKY, AND REST
ASSURED, EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED.
THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE HAS
STOPPED ITS TILT AWAY FROM THE

42:48.766 --> 42:55.539
SUN.
SLOWLY, NEARLY IMPERCEPTIBLY AT
FIRST, THE DAYS WILL GROW
LONGER.

42:55.606 --> 43:03.380
COLD DARKNESS WILL ONCE AGAIN
GIVE WAY TO A KINDER LIGHT.
AND-- AT LEAST UNTIL JUNE-- WE
ALL HAVE A BRIGHTER FUTURE.

43:03.447 --> 43:06.817
I'M BILL WHITAKER.
WE'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK WITH
