WEBVTT

00:00.463 --> 00:03.331
I don't think we should be together
anymore. This is over.

00:04.926 --> 00:07.185
We want you
to play football for us at TMU.

00:07.345 --> 00:09.796
Hey, y'all,
the Smash is going for the U, baby!

00:11.432 --> 00:12.716
Leave my sister alone.

00:12.976 --> 00:15.718
You got one of ours,
why shouldn't we get one of yours?

00:16.781 --> 00:18.555
They've decided to suspend you

00:18.815 --> 00:21.516
- for three games.
- That's the rest of the regular season.

00:21.776 --> 00:23.393
- Where you going?
- Guatemala.

00:23.653 --> 00:26.730
I love you, and you love me.
I know that.

00:26.990 --> 00:30.107
I don't understand why you'd be leaving.
It doesn't make any sense.

00:30.369 --> 00:33.737
She had to leave a day early.
She really wanted to tell you good-bye.

00:36.855 --> 00:38.700
Don't burn my sausages.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.785
You know I like
those Jimmy Deans tender.

00:41.045 --> 00:43.567
I'm not making sausages, grandma.
I'm making eggs.

00:44.299 --> 00:46.541
I want french toast.
Carlotta says tuesdays

00:46.801 --> 00:49.315
- are french toast tuesdays.
- Carlotta's not here,

00:49.475 --> 00:51.479
so we're not gonna
be having...

00:51.888 --> 00:53.305
Oh, my lord!

00:55.501 --> 00:58.511
You cut my toast
in those little triangles I like.

00:58.771 --> 01:01.890
- Yep. Just for you.
- That looks so good, boy.

01:02.737 --> 01:03.807
Here you go.

01:06.564 --> 01:08.950
You just wait till
she comes back, though.

01:09.980 --> 01:12.052
She's not gonna come back,
grandma.

01:12.423 --> 01:13.467
Well...

01:13.976 --> 01:16.311
- We'll see.
- Yep. We will.

01:18.475 --> 01:19.683
You do a good job.

01:19.843 --> 01:20.981
Thank you.

01:27.342 --> 01:28.740
Why did she leave?

01:34.023 --> 01:35.171
I don't know.

01:38.643 --> 01:40.441
Well...
We are just fine.

01:44.997 --> 01:47.540
- I love you.
- I love you too. Have a good day.

01:47.700 --> 01:48.812
Be good.

01:49.530 --> 01:50.543
I'll try.

01:54.713 --> 01:56.659
At what time are your hands
on the wheel?

01:56.819 --> 01:57.861
10:00 and 2:00.

01:58.021 --> 02:01.371
Don't roll your eyes at me.
You're gonna need them for the road.

02:01.531 --> 02:04.725
And when you disrespect the vehicle,
accidents happen, understood?

02:04.885 --> 02:07.183
So when I start driving,
can you not be in my car?

02:07.343 --> 02:09.711
What's the speed limit
in a residential area?

02:09.871 --> 02:11.537
It depends on how many people I hit.

02:11.697 --> 02:13.468
Really funny.
You know what else's funny?

02:13.628 --> 02:15.960
You waving from a little window
of a big yellow bus.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.688
- You've seen my volleyball shoes?
- Where you left 'em, honey.

02:18.848 --> 02:20.147
Thank you, sweetie.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.301
30 miles an hour in a residential area
unless otherwise marked.

02:23.461 --> 02:26.055
And what's this state's
legal alcohol limit?

02:26.215 --> 02:27.206
.08, dad.

02:27.366 --> 02:30.108
For those over 21.
But for you it's zero.

02:30.268 --> 02:32.856
I catch any alcohol and you
together in a vehicle,

02:33.116 --> 02:35.017
and I promise
you will never drive again.

02:35.177 --> 02:39.164
Honey, I think you need to back off her.
I'm gonna take her for her test.

02:39.580 --> 02:42.128
Fine. You wanna fire me?
Good. I'll be in the bathroom.

02:42.288 --> 02:45.035
- TMI, dad.
- Maybe my shoes are in the car.

04:51.834 --> 04:55.001
This blows.
Can't get it done without Smash.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.018
We might as well kiss playoffs good-bye.

04:57.178 --> 04:58.939
You know what's gonna help
get us to State?

04:59.099 --> 05:02.714
- To keep whining like that.
- Oh, you gonna get us there solo?

05:02.974 --> 05:04.674
Nice play, man.
Thanks.

05:04.934 --> 05:07.018
You know what?
I did what I did.

05:07.178 --> 05:08.624
I don't have to explain myself...

05:08.784 --> 05:11.420
- Shut up! It's done.
- That's what I'm sayin'.

05:11.635 --> 05:14.517
You shut up too.
You don't have to talk always.

05:14.777 --> 05:17.213
Sit down. Take your seat.
Riggs, get a seat.

05:17.373 --> 05:18.521
Listen up, guys.

05:22.201 --> 05:24.193
Smash is suspended
for three games.

05:25.506 --> 05:27.322
This... is about

05:27.582 --> 05:29.431
more than just football,
gentlemen.

05:30.521 --> 05:33.036
It's about adversity
and how we stand up to it.

05:34.424 --> 05:36.664
No one said they were gonna
hand us the playoffs.

05:36.824 --> 05:38.981
What we are gonna do
is we're gonna work,

05:39.552 --> 05:42.108
we're gonna adjust,
and we're gonna work some more.

05:42.278 --> 05:44.672
We're gonna take adversity,
turn it into an asset,

05:44.832 --> 05:47.823
and we're gonna ride that asset
all the way to the damn playoffs.

05:47.983 --> 05:49.729
That's gonna start
with the team captains.

05:49.889 --> 05:51.473
What the hell happened to you?

05:52.995 --> 05:54.394
You look like hell, son.

05:55.109 --> 05:57.690
Here we go. Coach Crowley,
you wanna take us through it?

05:57.850 --> 06:00.688
This is their red zone offense,
their motions and trips.

06:00.948 --> 06:02.998
Let's talk about
these still lifes.

06:06.288 --> 06:07.487
Why don't you start?

06:07.844 --> 06:11.832
You can talk about your own drawing
or you can critique someone else's.

06:13.501 --> 06:14.501
They're okay.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.142
Can you elaborate on that?

06:17.514 --> 06:20.625
Talk about the composition,
value, accuracy.

06:21.457 --> 06:22.680
They're all okay.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.047
Art is more than just drawing.

06:26.307 --> 06:27.808
We need to analyze the work,

06:27.968 --> 06:30.863
talk about why a drawing
is successful or not.

06:31.846 --> 06:33.137
Do you think you succeeded?

06:33.397 --> 06:35.932
In drawing a vase of flowers?
Yes, I think I did.

06:36.903 --> 06:37.903
Okay, why?

06:38.063 --> 06:40.098
Because I can tell that it's a vase,

06:40.258 --> 06:42.468
and I can tell that
there's flowers in it.

06:44.114 --> 06:47.110
I'd like you to work a little harder
at your critique in the future.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.577
Bitch.

06:53.588 --> 06:54.782
Excuse me?

06:55.778 --> 06:56.952
What did you say?

06:57.213 --> 06:59.832
My critique is that we're drawing

06:59.992 --> 07:03.418
a bunch of sad, stupid pictures
of sad and stupid flowers.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.403
And I said bitch.

07:14.406 --> 07:15.406
Where you going?

07:15.861 --> 07:18.404
Matt, we have spanish
class in diez minutos.

07:18.564 --> 07:19.564
Screw it.

07:19.765 --> 07:22.006
Do you at least want me
to tell 'em that you got sick?

07:22.166 --> 07:23.404
I don't care.

07:33.088 --> 07:34.088
Jean.

07:34.625 --> 07:37.076
Right. You and Landry
do that physics thing together, right?

07:37.336 --> 07:38.339
Right.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.979
- I don't want this to be weird.
- You don't want what to be weird?

07:42.259 --> 07:44.452
Are you a friend, or are you competion?

07:44.899 --> 07:45.958
Competition?

07:48.437 --> 07:50.840
Oh, my God.
Are you talking about Landry?

07:53.514 --> 07:55.306
'Cause I like him.
I think he's great,

07:55.466 --> 07:58.139
and I'm not blind to see
the way he looks at you.

07:58.399 --> 08:00.561
I just wanted to make sure
nothing's happening there.

08:00.721 --> 08:01.955
We're just friends.

08:03.174 --> 08:05.104
Great. 'cause I'm telling you
I like him.

08:06.535 --> 08:09.317
Good. For you.
That's great.

08:09.577 --> 08:11.027
Go for it.
He's a great guy.

08:13.241 --> 08:14.572
I gotta get to practice.

08:14.832 --> 08:15.872
See you later.

08:22.006 --> 08:24.082
Hang 'em.
One thousand.

08:24.342 --> 08:25.708
One...
One thousand.

08:25.968 --> 08:27.877
Two...
One thousand.

08:28.831 --> 08:32.173
- Where the hell's Saracen?
- I don't see him.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.568
- Well, get him down here.
- All right.

08:34.770 --> 08:36.885
- How's Lance's knee?
- He's out for a while.

08:37.179 --> 08:39.767
- How'd he do that?
- He tripped over a curb.

08:40.274 --> 08:41.778
Tripped over a curb.

08:44.904 --> 08:46.182
- Take over.
- Yes, sir

08:46.342 --> 08:49.378
Coach, I know I'm suspended,
but I really want to be out here.

08:51.085 --> 08:52.935
I appreciate you suitin' up.

08:53.095 --> 08:55.488
You're a good captain.
You are a good team leader.

08:57.106 --> 08:59.283
Right now, I need to work
this team out here

08:59.543 --> 09:01.156
today, without you.

09:02.421 --> 09:04.197
You understand
what I'm saying?

09:09.077 --> 09:11.483
- I'm gonna go do weights.
- That a boy.

09:13.559 --> 09:15.216
Let's go.
Stretch 'em out good.

09:17.311 --> 09:18.761
Saracen's not here.

09:19.442 --> 09:21.430
I know he's not here.
Where the hell is he?

09:21.590 --> 09:23.975
Landry said he's home
and he's sick.

09:26.958 --> 09:28.614
Landry, Saracen, Smash.

09:29.858 --> 09:31.204
All right, listen up!

09:32.431 --> 09:33.806
Here's what we're gonna do.

09:33.966 --> 09:36.163
First string,
I want Brooks and Westin

09:36.323 --> 09:37.964
in for Smash and Saracen.

09:38.124 --> 09:39.574
Coaches, get 'em together.

09:39.835 --> 09:41.909
Let's go.
We got a lotta work to do.

09:42.169 --> 09:45.249
Good lord, what are you
talking about, Brooks for Smash?

09:45.881 --> 09:47.068
Brooks for Smash.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.984
All right.
All right.

09:49.144 --> 09:51.127
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- G.C, get 'em together!

09:57.393 --> 10:00.353
- What are you doing?
- I have a surprise for you.

10:00.513 --> 10:02.149
- What?
- I found the mother lode.

10:02.309 --> 10:05.045
Mystery science theater
3000 short forms on youtube.

10:05.212 --> 10:07.810
- There's at least, like 50 of 'em.
- Are you serious?

10:08.070 --> 10:10.229
- Excited?
- Don't mess with me, that wouldn't

10:10.489 --> 10:12.113
- be funny.
- I wouldn't lie to you.

10:12.273 --> 10:14.650
That pretty much takes
care of the entire weekend.

10:14.910 --> 10:16.652
At least, let's try
to stretch this out.

10:16.912 --> 10:19.522
We have to watch them
in order, like alphabetical order

10:19.682 --> 10:22.480
- or some other crazy kind of order.
- We'll come up with something.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.993
We'll figure it out.

10:26.892 --> 10:30.587
- It'll be fun.
- I'm gonna have to prop my leg up.

10:31.343 --> 10:33.827
It really takes
a good technique to...

10:34.339 --> 10:35.681
sit on the bench.

10:36.429 --> 10:38.929
You think you could possibly
bring some ice?

10:39.089 --> 10:40.779
The doctor said
I'm supposed to ice it.

10:40.939 --> 10:42.660
20 minutes on,
20 minutes off.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.693
That sounds like
a great weekend.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.168
I hope I'm invited.

10:48.316 --> 10:51.077
You know, I keep telling her
to run a back slide,

10:51.237 --> 10:53.686
and every single time,
she's gonna set it up high

10:53.846 --> 10:56.033
and outside...
Every single time without fail.

10:56.193 --> 10:57.885
You didn't hear this from me,

10:58.045 --> 11:00.342
but Catherine's not
gonna set to Megan anymore,

11:00.953 --> 11:04.075
'cause Megan started
seeing her ex, Jimbo.

11:04.335 --> 11:05.857
- Good grief.
- I know.

11:06.017 --> 11:08.064
- Dinner was really good.
- Thank you, sweetie.

11:08.224 --> 11:10.775
Those mashed potatoes
were unbelievable.

11:10.935 --> 11:12.750
The butter.
I know, I know.

11:14.636 --> 11:17.109
Mrs. T.,
can if I ask you a question?

11:17.339 --> 11:19.382
Is it insane
if I feel a little jealous

11:19.642 --> 11:22.264
that some girl
likes Landry Clarke?

11:23.694 --> 11:25.680
Lance Landry clarke?

11:27.792 --> 11:30.880
I don't know.
I mean, do you like Landry Clarke?

11:31.910 --> 11:33.396
No, it's nothing like that.

11:33.656 --> 11:35.210
It's just that
this girl Jean,

11:35.370 --> 11:38.571
she asked my permission
to start seeing him and...

11:39.321 --> 11:42.231
I said yes. Not that she needs
my permission or anything.

11:42.484 --> 11:45.622
It's affecting me so much,
I feel like I'm going crazy.

11:46.293 --> 11:48.452
I had a boy like that
in high school, Scott Hunter.

11:48.712 --> 11:50.496
And he was real nerdy,
you know...

11:50.756 --> 11:52.535
- She doesn't need to...
- She asked.

11:52.695 --> 11:54.542
I thought he was so sweet.

11:54.802 --> 11:58.414
He had the biggest crush on me,
and it felt good, and I liked that.

11:58.574 --> 12:01.350
So I let it go on a little while,
but finally I realized:

12:01.510 --> 12:02.653
It's not fair.

12:02.813 --> 12:04.851
The fair thing to do,
the kind thing to do

12:05.011 --> 12:06.301
is to let him go.

12:06.461 --> 12:09.205
Good guys always finish last.
That's what she's trying to say.

12:09.365 --> 12:12.811
It's not, 'cause look at you.
You finished first, didn't you?

12:12.971 --> 12:15.586
- I don't know about that!
- Well, I do. Look deep in your soul.

12:15.746 --> 12:18.733
Tyra, do you wanna go do our precalc?
We can finish it up.

12:20.869 --> 12:23.231
You know what?
I actually have to get going.

12:23.391 --> 12:25.671
But I'll see you
at school tomorrow?

12:26.877 --> 12:30.278
- Thank you for dinner. It was amazing.
- Of course, honey, and let me tell you.

12:30.438 --> 12:32.663
You are doing a great job.
I'm so proud of you.

12:32.923 --> 12:34.957
- See you tomorrow at practice.
- Thanks, Mrs. T.

12:35.217 --> 12:37.244
- Keep it up! Bye.
- Bye, guys.

12:37.404 --> 12:39.795
- Bye, hon. Get home safely.
- Bye, coach.

12:40.055 --> 12:41.056
Okay.

12:48.785 --> 12:51.521
Honey, we should go
on vacation, just the two of us.

12:51.681 --> 12:52.947
You know what I mean?

12:53.107 --> 12:55.354
Now that Gracie girl's
getting a little older.

12:55.544 --> 12:57.189
We could leave her
with my sister.

12:57.349 --> 13:01.041
Honey, haven't we been planning
that same vacation for 16 years now?

13:01.201 --> 13:02.599
I'm just sayin'.

13:03.561 --> 13:05.194
You gonna come to
my volleyball game?

13:05.354 --> 13:07.615
I wouldn't miss it
for anything in the world.

13:08.757 --> 13:11.501
I have to say, I'm having
such a good time with this coaching.

13:11.661 --> 13:14.163
I mean,
it's so satisfying.

13:14.423 --> 13:18.412
Because it's nice to have some
teenage girls listen to me for a change.

13:18.572 --> 13:20.002
That's probably
what it is.

13:22.827 --> 13:26.634
You realize that
Julie's a bit envious, don't you?

13:27.186 --> 13:30.463
What, you mean of the volleyball thing?
Julie hates volleyball, sweetie.

13:30.623 --> 13:33.284
I understand, but you gotta understand
how sensitive she is too.

13:33.444 --> 13:37.950
Sweetheart, who knows how sensitive
our dear daughter is more than me?

13:38.614 --> 13:40.464
You're barking up the wrong tree.

13:40.624 --> 13:43.465
I may be barking up the wrong tree.
I just thought I'd say something.

13:43.625 --> 13:47.023
- Envious?
- I just wanted you to keep it in mind.

14:00.213 --> 14:02.643
If you're thinking about
grabbing the world by the berries

14:02.803 --> 14:04.945
and lighting your own fire,
that's what you need.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.250
- No, it's cool, I...
- Sit on it.

14:08.097 --> 14:11.994
- It's a little out of my price range.
- That's the old you talking. Get on it.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.556
Give it a burn.

14:16.191 --> 14:18.477
If you feed that baby right,
you'll never get off.

14:18.737 --> 14:20.627
- I know. This...
- Looks good.

14:20.787 --> 14:23.640
I'm gonna go get the key.
I'll be right back. Hang tight.

14:31.823 --> 14:32.823
QB one...

14:33.323 --> 14:34.973
Skippin' school again.

14:35.676 --> 14:36.616
Yeah, well,

14:36.776 --> 14:38.986
yesterday's kinda turned
into today, so...

14:39.418 --> 14:41.917
- What about you?
- I always skip wednesdays.

14:42.790 --> 14:45.368
Seriously, what's the deal
with the bike, though?

14:46.204 --> 14:47.214
Nothin'.

14:48.194 --> 14:51.802
- What are you gonna do?
- I was thinkin', hit the museum,

14:52.062 --> 14:54.179
yoga, library for a bit.

14:55.101 --> 14:57.153
Then again, I might just do the "ushz."

15:02.642 --> 15:03.856
Wanna go for a beer?

15:11.077 --> 15:13.971
How did you know that we weren't
gonna get carded here?

15:14.282 --> 15:17.147
Charlie? He'll never card me.
I mean, he's old school.

15:22.132 --> 15:24.838
So coach was pretty rattled
at you yesterday,

15:24.998 --> 15:26.221
not showin' up.

15:26.919 --> 15:29.895
- Gonna show up today or what?
- No. No, I'm not.

15:30.313 --> 15:31.824
I'm not done being dumped.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.898
You know what was good about
the way I got dumped though?

15:36.058 --> 15:38.352
Carlotta, she just dumped me.

15:38.512 --> 15:40.601
She just left a note on the pillow

15:40.861 --> 15:42.311
and left the country.

15:42.571 --> 15:44.522
Over.
Like the breakup fairy.

15:53.785 --> 15:56.526
- You want a funnel or... You know?
- No, I just...

15:58.092 --> 15:59.453
I wanna be more like you.

15:59.945 --> 16:01.841
It doesn't matter.
Smash is off the team.

16:02.001 --> 16:04.316
The season's done.
You're fine, that's fine.

16:04.602 --> 16:08.072
You can get any girl you want.
You get all the girls, whatever.

16:08.232 --> 16:10.756
And nothing matters.
You're just always... the same.

16:11.016 --> 16:13.602
Even-keeled.
That's what I wanna be able to do.

16:13.762 --> 16:16.161
I wanna be able to be even-keeled.
Always.

16:18.024 --> 16:19.909
Look at these two bible thumpers.

16:21.527 --> 16:24.492
They come here every day for lunch.
Isn't that sad?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.190
It's sad if you ask me.

16:26.769 --> 16:28.983
Stalkin's sad if you ask me.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.631
All right. Stay here.
I'll be right back.

16:35.751 --> 16:36.751
Burger...

16:39.572 --> 16:41.871
What's going on?
How you guys doing?

16:42.780 --> 16:45.499
- Can I help you?
- Tim Riggins.

16:46.184 --> 16:49.295
It is a pleasure. It really is.
You have great hair.

16:49.983 --> 16:52.840
The other night, you were brilliant.
That sermon you did...

16:53.100 --> 16:54.641
- Tim, please.
- I appreciate that.

16:54.801 --> 16:56.941
I'm glad you were there.
You should come back.

16:57.101 --> 16:58.948
- Anytime.
- Might just have to.

16:59.626 --> 17:01.518
- You look great.
- She does.

17:01.678 --> 17:04.083
- You both look great. Together.
- Thank you.

17:06.384 --> 17:08.606
We got a pitcher
if you guys are interested.

17:08.866 --> 17:09.876
Shalom.

17:13.787 --> 17:14.943
See ya, Garrity.

17:17.958 --> 17:20.045
- Let's go.
- Where we going?

17:20.204 --> 17:22.349
- We're going to practice.
- No, I can't go.

17:22.510 --> 17:24.079
You can. Chug some water.

17:24.339 --> 17:25.998
Corn nuts for the breath.
Let's go.

17:29.797 --> 17:31.065
- Eat it!
- Okay.

17:32.222 --> 17:33.858
Careful now.

17:34.072 --> 17:35.966
Watch both ways very clearly

17:36.226 --> 17:37.576
around that corner.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.139
You know what I been wanting
to ask you, hon?

17:42.399 --> 17:44.475
You don't wanna play
on the volleyball team

17:44.735 --> 17:47.463
- or anything, do you?
- What? No, I don't.

17:47.623 --> 17:50.731
Careful, he's pulling out right there.
You gotta... Eyes all around.

17:51.449 --> 17:54.568
I just wanted to check in with you
about that, about the volleyball.

17:54.828 --> 17:57.821
- Have you seen their uniforms?
- Well, yes, I have.

17:59.164 --> 18:01.241
Volleyball's just not my thing,
you know?

18:01.866 --> 18:04.169
You're not gonna make me
play or something, are you?

18:04.329 --> 18:07.365
Oh. No!
Of course I'm not gonna make you play.

18:07.525 --> 18:09.817
Of course I wouldn't do that.
I... There's a red light.

18:10.093 --> 18:13.483
There's a red light. Watch...
Ease into your stop. Ease into your...

18:13.643 --> 18:17.049
Well, okay, all right.
We're gonna practice that.

18:17.836 --> 18:19.286
We'll practice that.

18:20.229 --> 18:21.137
All right!

18:21.297 --> 18:24.306
- Come on, let's go out there!
- All right, we're goin'.

18:24.794 --> 18:27.478
When I run, you know,
want me to run, I'll run.

18:27.638 --> 18:28.856
Ready?

18:29.100 --> 18:31.313
You get me?
Stop smiling. Serious game.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.361
You get it?

18:33.661 --> 18:35.465
All right! Set!

18:36.413 --> 18:37.413
Blue...

18:37.573 --> 18:39.895
Whoa, man!
I'm not your sitter. Come on!

18:40.466 --> 18:42.832
- Let's go!
- We're good. We're good.

18:43.883 --> 18:45.061
On your marks!

18:45.672 --> 18:46.976
Get set!

18:49.132 --> 18:51.709
Overhaul! Do the overhaul!
Red...

18:52.100 --> 18:54.743
The red thing.
You're good... Line up, red.

18:54.903 --> 18:58.048
The red, you got that?
You got it? All right!

18:59.653 --> 19:01.562
Green 20!

19:02.317 --> 19:04.241
Green 20!
Hut!

19:05.176 --> 19:06.974
Get your ass over here right now!

19:07.234 --> 19:09.309
That's a good effort.
Good effort.

19:11.171 --> 19:12.275
What's going on?

19:13.184 --> 19:14.800
What the hell are you doing?

19:15.742 --> 19:17.567
What the hell are you smiling at?

19:20.135 --> 19:22.328
Nothin'.
It's been a really bad day,

19:22.488 --> 19:24.616
so I was trying
to have some fun out there.

19:29.791 --> 19:33.115
You get your ass out there,
and you get it together right now.

19:35.201 --> 19:36.215
Yes, sir.

19:40.751 --> 19:41.914
You smell that?

19:45.173 --> 19:46.471
No, I don't.

19:50.485 --> 19:52.363
Jean's just such a cool girl.

19:52.966 --> 19:55.068
You know,
she really appreciates

19:55.470 --> 19:56.996
all different types of films.

19:57.224 --> 19:59.314
She's really like a film scholar.

19:59.474 --> 20:00.568
I need to decide

20:00.728 --> 20:02.997
which movie is gonna be
more conducive to romance.

20:03.157 --> 20:05.991
Is it gonna be Wrath of Khan
or is it gonna be Jaws?

20:06.251 --> 20:08.532
- Does it really matter?
- It does matter.

20:08.692 --> 20:11.884
Because this is kinda big for me.
This is gonna decide whether or not

20:12.044 --> 20:14.728
Jean Binnel's gonna pass
through those velvet ropes

20:15.102 --> 20:17.336
to becoming my girl,
you know?

20:17.605 --> 20:19.880
- You look like you're gonna throw up.
- I'm okay.

20:20.608 --> 20:22.049
Are you gonna eat that?

20:23.709 --> 20:26.551
You're very dehydrated.
Which happens whenever you get drunk.

20:26.711 --> 20:28.951
- That's why I'm drinking.
- It's called a side-effect.

20:29.111 --> 20:30.809
Buddy, Landry.
What's going on?

20:31.693 --> 20:33.268
What's goin' on is
we're gonna be

20:33.528 --> 20:35.479
the first team in Texas football history

20:35.739 --> 20:38.923
to win the state championship
and not make the playoffs next year,

20:39.083 --> 20:41.527
courtesy of one
Brian "Smash" Williams.

20:41.790 --> 20:43.695
- Good to have you here.
- He's hung over,

20:43.955 --> 20:45.823
in case you were wondering.

20:46.573 --> 20:48.435
Matty, I'm not happy about this.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.981
I'm just trying to keep my head down
and move through it.

20:51.141 --> 20:54.353
It's on you and the team to get to the
playoffs so I can get back on the field.

20:54.513 --> 20:55.791
You know what he did?

20:56.408 --> 20:59.628
This guy also ditched school
with Tim Riggins.

20:59.889 --> 21:01.922
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

21:02.182 --> 21:03.971
- That's your new role model?
- No, it's...

21:04.131 --> 21:07.094
I just don't wanna see you
become at-risk youth.

21:07.354 --> 21:10.806
Why don't you discuss what's going on
in Matt Saracen's life?

21:11.066 --> 21:12.568
I'm trying to reach out to you,

21:12.728 --> 21:14.875
and you're just walking away from me
just like that.

21:15.035 --> 21:16.542
Keep walkin', Matt.
Walk away.

21:16.702 --> 21:18.212
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.

21:18.372 --> 21:19.402
Walk away.

21:20.554 --> 21:21.904
What do you think?

21:22.794 --> 21:24.743
You think The Wrath of Khan or Jaws

21:25.415 --> 21:26.488
for like a date?

21:27.969 --> 21:28.969
What?

21:31.546 --> 21:32.703
Jaws?

21:33.756 --> 21:35.956
Let's go y'all.
You can do it.

21:47.686 --> 21:50.596
Work together now! Come on now, y'all.
Call the ball!

21:59.739 --> 22:00.939
Beautiful, ya'll.

22:07.665 --> 22:11.116
Let's finish it.
Watch their center. Close the block.

22:11.376 --> 22:14.161
Let's do now, y'all. You can do it.
Teamwork! Let's go!

22:27.941 --> 22:30.267
That was a victory.
I knew y'all could do it!

22:30.427 --> 22:31.595
I'm so proud of you!

22:31.855 --> 22:34.473
- One, two, three!
- Panthers!

22:35.658 --> 22:36.994
Let's go to my house!

22:48.407 --> 22:51.316
All right,
who wants a hot fudge sundae?

22:54.218 --> 22:55.911
Mrs T?
You had a mullet.

22:57.532 --> 22:58.664
That was a good look.

22:58.965 --> 23:00.790
You didn't like the perm?

23:01.051 --> 23:02.621
Mom, I like you in a perm.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.836
I like the way that looks.

23:05.096 --> 23:07.370
And you like to dance, don't you?

23:07.530 --> 23:08.548
Thanks.

23:10.071 --> 23:11.085
What?

23:18.058 --> 23:19.058
Excuse me.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.146
What's goin' on?

23:25.283 --> 23:27.112
Is this what your dad
was talking about?

23:27.272 --> 23:29.444
- I have no idea.
- He said that you were feeling

23:29.704 --> 23:32.072
a little sensitive about me
coaching volleyball.

23:32.332 --> 23:33.346
Volleyball.

23:33.506 --> 23:35.627
It does seem to me that you
have not been a big fan

23:35.787 --> 23:38.432
of this volleyball situation,
and I know it must be

23:38.592 --> 23:40.422
eating up some time
that we have together.

23:40.582 --> 23:43.991
But we are gonna have to learn
to deal with the situation

23:44.151 --> 23:46.491
without you comin' in
and slamming around.

23:46.651 --> 23:48.171
Sorry. Maybe I'm being rude.

23:48.431 --> 23:51.205
I just believe in mom
when she says I'll see you at the DMV.

23:56.931 --> 23:58.362
Oh, hon...

23:58.914 --> 24:01.863
I waited there an hour.
I tried calling your cell phone.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.645
I tried calling the house.

24:03.905 --> 24:06.168
You're right. I should just work
on my jealousy issues.

24:06.328 --> 24:08.057
Sweetie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:08.539 --> 24:09.568
I'm so sorry.

24:21.654 --> 24:24.083
- We're closed, ma'am.
- You work here?

24:24.422 --> 24:26.060
Let me ask you something.

24:26.220 --> 24:28.511
You're not supposed to close
for another ten minutes.

24:28.671 --> 24:30.942
I shut everything down.
My last appointment left...

24:31.102 --> 24:33.050
My daughter missed
her appointment today

24:33.310 --> 24:35.510
- because of me.
- She can come back tomorrow.

24:35.770 --> 24:38.039
Let me just tell you,
this is my fault...

24:39.010 --> 24:40.214
And I just...

24:41.626 --> 24:43.139
It's just important.

24:43.299 --> 24:44.484
I can understand that.

24:44.644 --> 24:46.044
If I don't redeem myself,

24:46.204 --> 24:49.691
I may not get her to trust me
again for a while, and that's just gonna

24:50.384 --> 24:51.425
be a problem.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.058
Do you have kids?

24:54.016 --> 24:55.360
There are ten minutes...

24:55.520 --> 24:57.824
All right, she can
take the road test today.

24:58.084 --> 25:00.455
- That is so kind.
- But I can't do any of the paperwork

25:00.615 --> 25:02.089
- until tomorrow.
- Great.

25:02.589 --> 25:05.283
- Are you a Panther's fan?
- No. I hate football.

25:06.139 --> 25:07.594
Okay. Come here, sweetie.

25:08.993 --> 25:10.082
Here you go.

25:12.350 --> 25:15.068
Alright. Go get 'em.
You know what you're doing.

25:15.228 --> 25:16.832
That's my daughter Julie.

25:18.010 --> 25:21.856
- Thanks.
- We're gonna make a right over here.

25:22.016 --> 25:23.623
Good. Just take it easy.

25:26.991 --> 25:28.640
There she goes,
Gracie Bell.

25:30.346 --> 25:32.195
Taking her driver's test.

25:34.927 --> 25:36.298
Can't believe it.

25:41.002 --> 25:42.970
Oh, my God.
Honey, can you come over here?

25:43.130 --> 25:45.705
I gotta ask you a serious question.
You see these things on me?

25:45.966 --> 25:47.540
They're like whiskers.
You see them?

25:48.136 --> 25:50.001
Just pay to get a wax, it's easier.

25:50.482 --> 25:51.600
Oh, my God.

25:53.929 --> 25:55.510
Mama, did you ever...

25:56.403 --> 25:57.801
compete with a girl over a guy?

26:00.912 --> 26:02.763
Oh, honey,
well, the question is really,

26:03.494 --> 26:05.891
did I ever not compete
with a girl over a guy?

26:06.051 --> 26:08.688
- Come on, seriously.
- I am serious.

26:09.194 --> 26:11.873
I- I like the chase.
I like the challenge, poor girls.

26:12.033 --> 26:13.315
Did you like the guy?

26:14.640 --> 26:15.944
I like to win.

26:16.707 --> 26:18.144
Okay, see, that's just sick.

26:19.291 --> 26:20.847
I know but I'll tell you something.

26:21.007 --> 26:23.639
This whole family, that kinda competion,
it runs in your blood.

26:23.799 --> 26:26.371
I just think it's stupid
to compete over something like that.

26:27.114 --> 26:29.260
Well, you're right. It is stupid.

26:29.420 --> 26:32.460
But you're so much more evolved
than your poor mother, thank God.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.670
Would you like a diet coke, my daughter?

26:34.931 --> 26:36.016
That's okay.

26:44.174 --> 26:45.722
Two more lemon drops!

26:45.882 --> 26:48.559
You like those, right?
You're not gonna puke yet, are ya?

26:48.820 --> 26:50.686
I don't know
why we never do this before.

26:50.947 --> 26:52.473
- Me neither.
- I don't either.

26:52.633 --> 26:54.986
'Cause it's good times.
You know what?

26:55.146 --> 26:56.953
Keep drinkin',
I got a surprise for ya.

26:57.113 --> 26:58.652
You gettin' another round?

27:07.372 --> 27:10.040
- You see... the rookie right there?
- Yeah.

27:12.886 --> 27:13.876
Hey, Chastity!

27:17.641 --> 27:18.756
My treat, my treat.

27:19.018 --> 27:21.342
Take it easy on him.
He's still in high school.

27:22.844 --> 27:25.390
He's a cutie pie!

27:26.462 --> 27:27.907
Yeah, you like him?

27:29.738 --> 27:31.518
Why are those guys
gettin' all the action?

27:31.780 --> 27:34.396
'Cause they're younger
and don't need viagra! Don't touch me.

27:35.658 --> 27:37.250
I'm almost done with high school.

27:37.410 --> 27:38.766
- Really?
- Yes.

27:40.339 --> 27:41.821
Here, drink up!

27:42.281 --> 27:43.781
- Drink up!
- Oh, shoot.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.366
That's great.

27:47.816 --> 27:49.496
Oh, shoot, I'm vibrating, girl.

27:50.419 --> 27:51.664
You're making me buzz!

27:53.741 --> 27:55.197
You're making me...

27:57.317 --> 27:59.339
- Where you goin'?
- I'm gonna be back.

28:00.153 --> 28:01.679
You'll hurt her feelings, Mattie!

28:01.839 --> 28:02.676
7!

28:03.159 --> 28:04.969
You talk to Crowley
about the basic defense?

28:05.231 --> 28:06.749
I did. 4-3.

28:09.724 --> 28:10.725
Yeah?

28:14.414 --> 28:16.364
I need to talk to you, coach.

28:18.516 --> 28:21.026
- I'll, uh... I'll see you in a few.
- All right.

28:25.377 --> 28:26.379
Brian?

28:32.174 --> 28:33.175
TMU.

28:42.245 --> 28:44.008
They're revoking my scholarship.

28:46.078 --> 28:48.263
It's off the board's decision.
They say I've got...

28:49.132 --> 28:50.705
questionable character.

28:53.269 --> 28:54.852
That's the mark of death, coach.

29:02.177 --> 29:03.581
That's my future.

29:08.464 --> 29:10.994
No!
Her name is Lorraine...

29:11.395 --> 29:12.397
Saracen.

29:13.069 --> 29:14.497
Yes, your hospital left me

29:14.757 --> 29:17.696
many voice mails,
about Lorraine Saracen...

29:18.878 --> 29:21.218
I'm her g-grandson.

29:22.319 --> 29:23.714
Yes! I'm on my way.

29:24.751 --> 29:27.850
I guess she...
She hit her head getting out of bed.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.469
Well, I am just so sorry,

29:33.020 --> 29:35.318
pulling you away from your customers.

29:35.621 --> 29:37.671
But I do thank you...

29:38.384 --> 29:39.482
so much.

29:39.642 --> 29:42.975
No, no, no.
Don't worry about it, Matt, it's cool.

29:46.789 --> 29:50.483
Actually, I suffer from an illness
which is called selachophobia...

29:50.643 --> 29:53.953
Which is the fear of sharks.
And I would appreciate it if you would,

29:54.213 --> 29:56.895
instead of ridiculing me,
maybe support me a little bit.

29:57.055 --> 29:58.541
Right, so don't be like...

29:58.802 --> 29:59.902
One summer...

30:00.062 --> 30:02.094
- 1,100 boys in the water...
- That's not funny!

30:02.254 --> 30:04.005
Hey, Jean.
Hi.

30:04.265 --> 30:05.298
Hey, Tyra.

30:05.458 --> 30:06.867
- How are you doing?
- Good.

30:07.310 --> 30:09.427
Did you...
Did you see <i>Jaws</i> too?

30:11.386 --> 30:13.521
Yeah.
Great, great movie.

30:16.043 --> 30:18.002
Can I talk to you for a minute?

30:18.957 --> 30:20.202
- Sure.
- Yeah.

30:20.657 --> 30:22.508
- Yeah. That okay?
- Yeah.

30:26.069 --> 30:27.411
Everything okay?

30:29.274 --> 30:32.821
Yeah. This is hard to say,
so I'm just gonna say it. Look...

30:34.616 --> 30:35.803
I like you.

30:38.396 --> 30:40.682
You were right, okay?
I do like you.

30:43.538 --> 30:45.188
I wanna give us a shot.

30:50.995 --> 30:53.278
That's what you came here to say, was...

30:53.903 --> 30:54.903
Yeah.

30:58.708 --> 31:01.103
I mean, I'm on...
I'm on a date right now...

31:02.675 --> 31:05.254
Tyra, and she's not...
She's not embarrassed of me

31:05.414 --> 31:07.945
or to be seen with me.
She actually likes me.

31:08.105 --> 31:10.238
Last time I checked,
you were somewhere in-between.

31:10.498 --> 31:12.133
That's not fair, Landry.

31:12.293 --> 31:14.381
- You was...
- That's not fair!

31:15.546 --> 31:17.871
We both know how we got together,
and it wasn't exactly

31:18.131 --> 31:19.846
under normal circumstances.

31:21.311 --> 31:22.583
It was messed up

31:22.844 --> 31:25.723
and scary, and, yeah, I was...
I was confused.

31:26.464 --> 31:27.714
But I'm not now.

31:34.076 --> 31:35.076
Well...

31:37.484 --> 31:38.873
I'm on a date.

31:43.125 --> 31:44.146
Look, I'm sorry.

31:44.407 --> 31:46.994
- I don't know what else to say.
- No, no, I... I'm sorry.

31:47.154 --> 31:49.610
I'm really sorry.
You... you have a great night.

31:49.871 --> 31:51.678
I'll... I'll see you around.

31:56.627 --> 31:58.745
- Ready to get outta here?
- Yeah.

32:05.712 --> 32:06.742
Let's go.

32:17.504 --> 32:18.504
Brian?

32:18.957 --> 32:19.957
Baby?

32:20.459 --> 32:22.892
What you doing?
You been in here all night.

32:23.128 --> 32:26.636
This is all my TMU stuff.
The pamphlets, the posters, the gear...

32:26.796 --> 32:29.067
I'm gettin' rid of it,
'cause it's over, mama.

32:30.921 --> 32:31.921
It's over.

32:35.377 --> 32:37.157
You wanna tell me I told ya so?

32:39.385 --> 32:40.385
No.

32:43.578 --> 32:46.052
I just wanna let you know
I love you.

32:46.743 --> 32:48.248
Oh, I love you.

32:50.086 --> 32:51.380
And I believe in you.

32:54.256 --> 32:55.607
I believe in you.

33:17.031 --> 33:19.274
Coach.
Sorry for calling you.

33:19.434 --> 33:21.758
No, I appreciate it.
What's going on?

33:21.918 --> 33:23.787
We didn't know what else to do.

33:24.195 --> 33:25.282
I understand.

33:25.748 --> 33:26.769
All right.

33:27.671 --> 33:28.816
Hey, Ms. Saracen.

33:29.428 --> 33:30.674
Coach Taylor!

33:31.318 --> 33:33.005
- How you doing?
- How are you doing?

33:33.165 --> 33:35.591
I'm feeling much better
now that I know you're all right.

33:35.852 --> 33:38.086
It's so good to see you.
How's your wife and Gracie?

33:38.246 --> 33:40.544
They're doing just fine.
I'm here to...

33:41.014 --> 33:43.390
I'm here to take y'all home,
if that's all right.

33:43.794 --> 33:46.310
Well, yes it is.
I'm ready to go home.

33:46.571 --> 33:48.820
Gimme a hand here real quick.
Why don't we...

33:48.980 --> 33:51.148
walk with this gentlemen?
I'll be right with you.

33:52.551 --> 33:55.064
- I'm Lorraine.
- Nice to meet you.

33:55.871 --> 33:57.921
What the hell are you thinkin'?

33:58.468 --> 33:59.468
I wasn't.

34:02.632 --> 34:05.739
You know you smell like a damn drunk
right now, don't you?

34:06.731 --> 34:07.731
Yeah.

34:08.056 --> 34:08.958
I do.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.476
Thank you.
Come on, Ms. Saracen.

34:18.636 --> 34:21.527
- Bye-bye. You keep up the good work.
- Thank you again.

34:21.688 --> 34:23.764
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, ma'am.

34:24.025 --> 34:26.016
- Here's your water.
- Sure you don't want me

34:26.277 --> 34:28.560
- to fix you a sandwich?
- No, I don't need a sandwich.

34:28.821 --> 34:30.954
No, I've already eaten.
Thank you very much.

34:31.114 --> 34:33.664
- We got a game tomorrow night.
- Yes, ma'am.

34:35.068 --> 34:38.543
Sure glad you came by,
'cause I think Matthew needs your help.

34:40.301 --> 34:41.161
Okay.

34:41.321 --> 34:42.842
- All righty.
- Good night.

34:43.002 --> 34:45.152
- Thank you again.
- You're welcome.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.237
I don't need any of your dad coach talk,
so you...

34:56.609 --> 34:58.007
feel free to just go home.

35:02.326 --> 35:04.335
Don't touch...
Get away from me!

35:04.495 --> 35:05.902
Get off me!

35:06.359 --> 35:09.351
Do you know how many people
depend on you to make good decisions?

35:10.198 --> 35:11.398
Do you have any idea?

35:11.795 --> 35:13.438
Your grandmother,
your teammates!

35:13.699 --> 35:15.048
You better start making 'em!

35:15.208 --> 35:18.486
You better stop being so damn selfish
and stop feeling sorry for yourself!

35:18.746 --> 35:20.320
Shut up!
You don't care about me!

35:20.581 --> 35:22.568
You left me for a better job!

35:22.977 --> 35:24.774
Your daughter left me for a better guy!

35:24.934 --> 35:26.884
Carlotta left me for Guatemala.

35:27.044 --> 35:29.029
My dad left me for a damn war!

35:32.214 --> 35:33.866
Everybody leaves me!

35:39.036 --> 35:40.459
What's wrong with me?

35:50.874 --> 35:52.768
There's nothing wrong with you.

35:57.583 --> 35:59.443
There's nothing wrong with you at all.

36:27.248 --> 36:30.367
<i>Shouldn't you be getting ready
for a football game right now?</i>

36:31.068 --> 36:32.517
I'll head over in just a minute.

36:32.869 --> 36:36.104
That's... that's a pretty snazzy sweater
you have on there.

36:41.332 --> 36:43.643
You come all the way
over here to tell me that?

36:58.840 --> 37:01.254
I don't know how to say this, but...

37:01.742 --> 37:02.839
Then don't.

37:03.101 --> 37:05.008
Will you please just try
and listen to me?

37:05.269 --> 37:07.427
Landry, Landry,
I don't wanna listen.

37:09.649 --> 37:11.199
Please don't do this.

37:12.534 --> 37:15.372
All right...
This isn't fair to you

37:15.532 --> 37:18.064
for me to just ignore this
and pretend like it's not there.

37:19.136 --> 37:21.786
I can't just keep
doing that to you, okay?

37:27.640 --> 37:29.341
You're making a mistake.

38:21.577 --> 38:23.027
I actually gotta go.

38:24.688 --> 38:27.382
There's kind of a spot
with my name on the bench.

38:28.290 --> 38:29.735
I can't Miss that, so...

38:29.895 --> 38:31.768
Then I'll see you after the game.

39:08.550 --> 39:09.633
Come on back.

39:09.894 --> 39:11.899
Okay, good, now...
No, you're cutting too soon.

39:12.059 --> 39:13.909
Honey, honey...
Honey!

39:14.961 --> 39:17.126
Stop! Stop!
Honey, hold on, hold on!

39:17.286 --> 39:18.859
Don't cut it yet!
Wait.

39:19.236 --> 39:21.437
I got it, okay?
I only missed two on my driving test.

39:24.307 --> 39:25.607
Hey.
How are y'all?

39:59.233 --> 40:00.233
Hey, y'all.

40:03.736 --> 40:05.986
Just came by to wish my team luck.

40:06.695 --> 40:07.695
Saracen...

40:09.696 --> 40:12.196
I wanted to stop by
and tell ya to kick some ass tonight.

40:13.822 --> 40:15.905
All you boys gotta do it tonight.

40:17.356 --> 40:20.101
This might end up being
the last place I ever play.

40:27.628 --> 40:28.628
Smash.

40:33.322 --> 40:37.005
Coach, I don't care what the board says
or if we forfeit the rest of the season.

40:37.165 --> 40:39.140
Smash is a part of this team.

40:39.377 --> 40:41.309
- That's right, coach.
- Let him play.

40:42.832 --> 40:45.354
He can't play,
and y'all are very well aware of that.

40:47.223 --> 40:50.276
Look, look, I know I can't play...

40:50.806 --> 40:51.806
all right?

40:53.177 --> 40:55.156
The best thing
you can do for me is win.

40:56.051 --> 40:58.743
Get to the playoffs. I'll be right back
with y'all doin' my thing.

40:59.813 --> 41:01.494
For now, I'll be watching.

41:02.444 --> 41:04.164
But y'all could still do this.

41:04.426 --> 41:07.043
I mean, look, you got Saracen, Riggins,

41:08.311 --> 41:10.671
Bradley can barely catch a cold,
much less a football.

41:12.642 --> 41:15.026
Brooks probably
the slowest brother in Texas.

41:15.968 --> 41:18.118
But, look, everybody plays hard.

41:19.224 --> 41:22.162
And no matter what happens out there,
y'all rember this.

41:22.819 --> 41:24.293
You the Dillon Panthers, baby.

41:24.453 --> 41:25.935
- That's right.
- That's right!

41:26.196 --> 41:27.562
Y'all are state champs.

41:34.898 --> 41:36.448
Y'all ready for this?

41:37.305 --> 41:43.396
