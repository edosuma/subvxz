00:11.203 --> 00:13.795
<i>The pursuit of higher education aside,</i>

00:13.820 --> 00:16.677
<i>there are so many reasons
people go to college.</i>

00:16.702 --> 00:18.974
<i>Some go to find love...</i>

00:20.350 --> 00:22.591
<i>...others to find their purpose.</i>

00:28.165 --> 00:31.886
<i>And for Vivek Shah,
the number-one reason he went</i>

00:31.911 --> 00:35.097
<i>was to reinvent himself
and finally fit in.</i>

00:35.122 --> 00:36.357
<i>But don't get me wrong...</i>

00:36.382 --> 00:39.853
<i>there'd been some bumps along
the road to his reinvention.</i>

00:39.878 --> 00:43.814
What's up with you and being
so close to my body, bro?

00:43.839 --> 00:46.609
Bro, you make it so hard
to root for you.

00:46.634 --> 00:48.907
Bitch, I will slap you.

00:48.932 --> 00:50.829
<i>But despite the growing pains,</i>

00:50.854 --> 00:53.022
<i>Vivek had finally found his way.</i>

00:53.047 --> 00:56.144
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.
Is that a domi-yes? Hm?

00:56.169 --> 00:57.659
Or a domi-nos, bitch?!

01:00.613 --> 01:01.982
Whoo!

01:02.007 --> 01:04.108
<i>And since being kicked out
of Winthrop house</i>

01:04.134 --> 01:06.070
<i>by the rich kids
and crashing at Hawkins,</i>

01:06.095 --> 01:09.168
<i>he had really started to fit in.</i>

01:09.703 --> 01:12.953
<i>But on the road to reinventing
yourself and trying to fit in,</i>

01:12.978 --> 01:15.814
<i>is it possible to fit in too well?</i>

01:15.847 --> 01:17.984
Get at me later, my [bleep].

01:20.771 --> 01:23.187

02:00.716 --> 02:01.717
Hold up.

02:01.749 --> 02:03.752
Did anybody peep that?

02:03.785 --> 02:05.120
Why is nobody trippin'?

02:05.154 --> 02:07.256
Trippin' on what? Somebody do something?

02:07.288 --> 02:09.424
Your boy, "V-Didge."

02:09.458 --> 02:11.761
Yo, it seems like he's starting to feel

02:11.793 --> 02:13.895
a little too at home at Hawkins.

02:13.928 --> 02:15.730
Well, I mean, the dude's
been crashing here,

02:15.763 --> 02:17.132
so technically, he <i> is</i> home.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.102
No, no, I'm saying, like, homeland home,

02:19.135 --> 02:21.237
motherland home, "For Us By Us,"

02:21.269 --> 02:23.939
but he ain't... one-of-us kind of home.

02:23.972 --> 02:26.374
Yo, he's starting to get
a little too comfortable, man.

02:26.407 --> 02:29.244
Well, I can argue Vivek
has always... been comfortable.

02:29.278 --> 02:30.313
Hey, Queen.

02:30.345 --> 02:31.280
We do it for the culture!

02:31.314 --> 02:33.115
Excuse me, Queen,
you thirsty this evening?

02:34.149 --> 02:35.117
You mad.

02:39.321 --> 02:41.924
- Yeah.
- No, I'm saying my problem is,

02:41.957 --> 02:43.726
we're <i> all</i> a little too comfortable

02:43.758 --> 02:45.727
with him being that comfortable.

02:45.761 --> 02:47.463
Somebody's gonna have to check his ass.

02:47.495 --> 02:48.930
What? Whoa! Can you...

02:48.964 --> 02:50.466
Dude, this is our boy
we're talking about here, okay?

02:50.499 --> 02:52.168
Not some stranger.

02:52.201 --> 02:55.304
This is harmless, sweet-faced,
chipper-ass Vivek.

02:55.337 --> 02:57.739
The dude's like a buff little
Disney prince or something.

02:57.773 --> 02:59.841
No, no, no. Did you not hear
what Rafael just called him?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.244
That's not Vivek's fault.

03:01.276 --> 03:03.813
You cannot blame him
for Rafael's dumbass comment.

03:06.182 --> 03:09.317
Plus, everybody knows Rafael
says the N-word all the time.

03:09.351 --> 03:10.686
The dude's got a serious problem.

03:12.353 --> 03:14.957
Come on, [bleep]. Come on!

03:14.989 --> 03:16.625
Ooh!

03:16.659 --> 03:18.960
My [bleep].

03:18.994 --> 03:20.329
Talkin' bout.

03:21.829 --> 03:23.266
Come on. Unh-unh. Don't do that.

03:23.298 --> 03:25.767
But that doesn't excuse
Vivek's behavior.

03:25.801 --> 03:28.171
Bro, he's appropriating
our culture... period.

03:28.203 --> 03:30.706
How can Vivek be guilty
of cultural appropriation?

03:30.738 --> 03:32.340
By definition, it means taking

03:32.374 --> 03:33.976
the elements of someone else's culture

03:34.008 --> 03:35.178
without knowing anything about it

03:35.210 --> 03:36.845
or having any respect for it.

03:36.879 --> 03:38.947
Vivek isn't stealing anything,
and you are buggin'.

03:38.981 --> 03:41.184
Yo, when I watch old boy brush his hair

03:41.216 --> 03:43.118
with the little wooden brush like that,

03:43.151 --> 03:45.020
I feel mad disrespected.

03:45.053 --> 03:46.221
From the way he brushes his hair?

03:46.255 --> 03:48.823
Yes, and you don't find it odd
that when we text each other,

03:48.857 --> 03:50.893
he sends me the black thumbs-up emoji?

03:53.863 --> 03:55.231
Honestly, I find it more odd

03:55.263 --> 03:57.032
that two grown-ass men text with emojis.

03:57.065 --> 03:58.133
Okay.

03:58.167 --> 03:59.735
And in his defense, Vivek is brown.

03:59.768 --> 04:01.404
What the hell color
is he supposed to use?

04:01.436 --> 04:02.904
Not the Wesley Snipes thumb.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.339
Yo, and... and... Okay.

04:04.373 --> 04:05.907
How do you explain
the whole video game thing?

04:08.444 --> 04:10.412
Doug, it's a basketball game.

04:10.446 --> 04:12.048
The majority of the players are Black.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.348
Here.

04:13.382 --> 04:15.384
Yo, he had the option
to customize his player

04:15.416 --> 04:17.219
to look exactly like himself,

04:17.252 --> 04:18.887
and he went and made it
look like 2 Chainz.

04:18.921 --> 04:22.257
Yo, I just think you're
too close to dude to see it.

04:22.291 --> 04:25.861
I guarantee you if this was
anybody else besides your BFF,

04:25.894 --> 04:28.231
you would find this whole thing mad sus.

04:28.264 --> 04:30.399
Just sayin'.

04:30.431 --> 04:32.867
<i>So, after learning
that a little volunteer work</i>

04:32.901 --> 04:36.005
<i>would not only help society
but also help me boost my grade</i>

04:36.038 --> 04:38.341
<i>so I could get off
of academic probation,</i>

04:38.373 --> 04:40.243
<i>I decided to scour the Internet.</i>

04:40.276 --> 04:42.111
You know, it's too bad
that Cal U won't give you

04:42.144 --> 04:44.280
extra credit for the type
of volunteer work that I do.

04:44.313 --> 04:45.580
Which is...?

04:45.613 --> 04:47.616
Writing sizeable
tax-deductible donations

04:47.649 --> 04:49.551
to private school students in Israel.

04:49.584 --> 04:51.253
Wow. How noble of you.

04:51.286 --> 04:53.221
I'm pretty much like the Jewish Oprah.

04:53.255 --> 04:55.257
Okay, you're insane.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.593
Well, I'm big on giving back, too.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.227
Once a year, I go with my church

04:59.260 --> 05:02.731
into low-income neighborhoods
to paint poor children's faces.

05:02.764 --> 05:07.637
You guys, you should see
the smile on their faces.

05:07.670 --> 05:09.071
After we paint them on.

05:09.103 --> 05:11.774
Okay, and <i> you're</i> insane, too.

05:11.806 --> 05:13.908
Ah. Damn it!

05:13.942 --> 05:15.877
The puppy rescue is full.

05:15.911 --> 05:17.313
You know, I would have killed

05:17.346 --> 05:20.082
to rescue a poor little
discarded golden retriever

05:20.115 --> 05:21.417
named Hector.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.918
- Ohh.
- That woman looks so fulfilled.

05:23.952 --> 05:25.821
Okay, well, is there
another site you can check?

05:25.853 --> 05:27.322
Uh...

05:27.356 --> 05:28.658
Actually, you know what?

05:28.690 --> 05:30.525
There's a site my father uses.

05:32.527 --> 05:34.763
- Arts and culture...
- Yeah.

05:34.796 --> 05:36.765
And ZIP code...

05:36.798 --> 05:38.933
Oh! "Project: Ballgown."

05:38.966 --> 05:40.402
This is actually pretty perfect.

05:40.435 --> 05:42.404
Not only can I stack extra credit,

05:42.438 --> 05:44.072
but I can also stack the confidence

05:44.106 --> 05:46.442
of high school girls
who can't afford prom dresses.

05:46.474 --> 05:47.909
- That's perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

05:47.942 --> 05:50.380
I mean... it's no face paint.

05:51.380 --> 05:52.315
<i>Yo, what's poppin', my people?</i>

05:52.348 --> 05:53.516
<i>This is your boy V-Didge,</i>

05:53.548 --> 05:55.618
<i>and we outchea in these Cal U streets!</i>

05:55.651 --> 05:56.619
Mm-hmm.

05:56.651 --> 05:58.253
Ooh, God, what is that?

05:58.286 --> 05:59.654
- Who taught him that?
- I'm telling you.

05:59.688 --> 06:01.156
<i>Brrrratt!</i>

06:01.190 --> 06:02.257
<i>Brrrr, brrrr, brrrr, brrrrrr...</i>

06:02.291 --> 06:03.759
<i>Mm! Mm!</i>

06:03.791 --> 06:05.460
Oh, see? Look. Look.

06:05.493 --> 06:07.529
Right there, Vivek just built
the best defense for himself.

06:07.563 --> 06:09.699
Black people don't let dogs
kiss them on the mouth.

06:09.731 --> 06:11.433
- That's just not a thing that we do.
- All right, cool.

06:11.466 --> 06:14.370
But none of the rest of that
seemed sus to you? Come on.

06:14.402 --> 06:15.337
I mean, sure, yeah,

06:15.370 --> 06:17.940
Vivek, as a human,
makes me feel very sus,

06:17.973 --> 06:20.309
conflicted, confused,
about a lot of things,

06:20.341 --> 06:22.178
but as a Black person, no.

06:22.211 --> 06:23.612
And besides, he's a minority, dude.

06:23.644 --> 06:24.779
He can't steal from us.

06:24.813 --> 06:27.048
It still doesn't give him
an all-access pass

06:27.082 --> 06:28.617
'cause he's not White.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.519
But it does give him
a limited-access pass,

06:30.551 --> 06:31.786
because as a minority,

06:31.820 --> 06:33.456
we know what it's like
to have to assimilate.

06:33.488 --> 06:34.789
We don't trust cops,

06:34.822 --> 06:36.959
we know the difference between
a well-seasoned piece of meat

06:36.991 --> 06:38.393
and that bland-ass bullshit

06:38.426 --> 06:39.894
White people cook for Thanksgiving.

06:39.928 --> 06:42.398
What the hell is a turducken?

06:42.430 --> 06:43.798
- Okay, I'm sorry, but, bro...
- Hm?

06:43.832 --> 06:46.000
...if you're not Black, right,
it doesn't matter

06:46.034 --> 06:49.372
how similar our taste buds
or our hardships are.

06:49.404 --> 06:51.506
You stay in your lane, I stay in mine.

06:51.539 --> 06:52.707
It's simple.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.709
But how can you tell which lane is which

06:54.743 --> 06:56.478
when everyone's trying to be us?

06:56.512 --> 06:58.413
Black culture <i> is</i> pop culture.

06:58.447 --> 06:59.582
It's not Vivek's fault

06:59.615 --> 07:01.484
that the lines are so blurred, you know?

07:03.185 --> 07:04.153
What was that?

07:04.185 --> 07:05.620
Who turnt up over there?

07:11.560 --> 07:12.595
What's happening?

07:12.627 --> 07:14.262
"Wave Cap Wednesday."

07:14.296 --> 07:16.665
And these [bleep] about
to be seasick! You hear me?

07:16.697 --> 07:18.032
Ohhh!

07:18.065 --> 07:18.767
Oh!

07:18.801 --> 07:20.567
Ohh!

07:20.568 --> 07:22.604
Man, I don't know about that.

07:22.637 --> 07:25.440
Come on. Come on.

07:25.474 --> 07:29.744
Ohh!

07:29.745 --> 07:31.614
Come on. Don't let me down.

07:31.647 --> 07:33.716
Don't let Daddy down.

07:33.748 --> 07:36.751
Ohh!

07:38.286 --> 07:39.688
My man! Unh!

07:39.721 --> 07:41.055
He won. He won that one.

07:43.459 --> 07:44.560
Yes, sir, hold up!

07:44.592 --> 07:46.628
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh! Whoa! Whoa!

07:46.661 --> 07:47.729
Hold up!

07:47.762 --> 07:48.563
What?

07:48.596 --> 07:50.632
Here we go. Here we go.

07:50.666 --> 07:53.667
Ohhhhh!

08:00.942 --> 08:04.579
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Man, how you like that?

08:04.613 --> 08:06.949
But the lines aren't
so blurred now, are they?

08:08.000 --> 08:14.074

08:15.261 --> 08:16.591
Welcome.

08:16.625 --> 08:19.167
The Zoey Johnson Styling Experience

08:19.192 --> 08:21.448
has officially gone philanthropic.

08:21.473 --> 08:24.266
I'm giving back
in the best way I know how...

08:24.298 --> 08:25.573
fashion.

08:29.437 --> 08:30.472
Oh, my God!

08:30.506 --> 08:32.908
She looks... stunning!

08:32.940 --> 08:35.910
She is possibly the second
most beautiful prom princess

08:35.943 --> 08:38.381
I have... God, I've ever seen.

08:43.217 --> 08:45.654
Uh, it's just... a little big on you,

08:45.686 --> 08:47.288
but I can fix that easy-peasy.

08:47.321 --> 08:49.591
- It's fine.
- No, it's super simple.

08:49.624 --> 08:52.094
All I have to do is take in
the waist, pull up the straps.

08:52.127 --> 08:54.363
Seriously, it doesn't matter.

08:54.396 --> 08:55.498
It's fine.

08:55.531 --> 08:56.464
Oh.

08:56.498 --> 08:57.932
Thank you.

08:57.965 --> 08:59.368
Okay, um...

09:01.570 --> 09:03.839
...you're welcome?

09:14.983 --> 09:16.518
Hey, you know that we don't
have to sit with Aaron, right?

09:16.551 --> 09:18.186
We can totally get our own table.

09:18.219 --> 09:19.821
No. No. I'm... I'm good.

09:19.854 --> 09:22.524
I'm good, because I am pivoting myself

09:22.557 --> 09:24.559
back into the friend zone with him.

09:24.593 --> 09:25.661
See?

09:25.694 --> 09:27.195
Pivot. Right back.

09:27.228 --> 09:28.631
So good.

09:28.664 --> 09:30.399
Yeah. Pfft. You're so good.

09:30.431 --> 09:32.166
And, look, you dodged a bullet, okay?

09:32.200 --> 09:34.235
I mean, the dude has beads
in his rattail.

09:34.268 --> 09:35.637
Hey.

09:35.671 --> 09:37.171
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:37.204 --> 09:38.541
Yo, Vivek.

09:38.574 --> 09:41.043
I see you ditched the waves.

09:41.075 --> 09:42.677
Yeah, dudes was getting nauseous.

09:42.710 --> 09:43.845
Your boy was too wavy.

09:43.878 --> 09:45.013
Yeah.

09:45.046 --> 09:47.048
Hey, ma, can I get
a Crown and Coke, please?

09:48.083 --> 09:50.752
Out of curiosity, uh,
why'd you order that?

09:50.786 --> 09:51.921
I don't know.

09:51.954 --> 09:53.421
'Cause it's a delectable cocktail

09:53.454 --> 09:54.989
that you introduced me to.

09:55.022 --> 09:57.325
And if I haven't thanked you
before, I'm thanking you now.

09:57.358 --> 09:58.727
Good lookin' out, homey.

09:58.759 --> 10:00.361
- Mm!
- No prob, homey.

10:03.431 --> 10:05.166
Oh, snap! This is my joint!

10:05.200 --> 10:06.935
Mm! Mm, mm!

10:06.969 --> 10:08.170
Mm-hmm!

10:08.203 --> 10:09.405
Mm!

10:09.437 --> 10:10.772
Mm! Mm-hmm!

10:10.805 --> 10:12.174
Hey.

10:12.206 --> 10:13.107
Hey!

10:13.141 --> 10:14.243
You look great.

10:14.276 --> 10:16.045
Thanks.

10:16.078 --> 10:18.613
It's good to see you. I, uh, missed you.

10:18.647 --> 10:20.114
Thanks.

10:20.147 --> 10:21.749
Uh, you want to dance, maybe?

10:21.782 --> 10:23.518
I can get you a drink.

Vivek is appropriating?

11:12.166 --> 11:13.835
Think about it...
from the Gucci he rocks...

11:13.868 --> 11:15.838
- Right.
- ....to the music he listens to.

11:15.871 --> 11:16.772
Right!

All the drugs that he deals!

11:19.507 --> 11:20.343

11:23.645 --> 11:25.614

with Black culture at all.

11:25.647 --> 11:26.982
Right. Right.

11:27.015 --> 11:28.984
But neither is rocking Gucci.
We didn't create that.

11:29.017 --> 11:31.487
If anything, the guy's guilty
of flexing too hard,

11:31.520 --> 11:33.255
not robbing us of our culture.

11:33.287 --> 11:36.691
If you ask me, I say he's just
celebrating, not appropriating.

11:36.724 --> 11:38.793
O-Oh, okay, but none of y'all
find it weird

11:38.826 --> 11:42.263
that out of all the things
he celebrates, it's <i> our</i> shit?

11:42.296 --> 11:44.700
Maybe those are just his preferences.

11:44.733 --> 11:46.669
Oh, Sky, no.

11:46.701 --> 11:47.835
We have to stay woke.

11:47.868 --> 11:49.772
I mean, knowing the deep history

11:49.805 --> 11:51.507
of fetishization of Black culture,

11:51.540 --> 11:53.676
and especially Black women,

11:53.709 --> 11:55.678
as an ally of the struggle,

11:55.710 --> 11:59.514
I find it deeply problematic
to excuse Vivek's behavior.

12:00.916 --> 12:02.284
Do <i> you</i> want to take this?

12:02.316 --> 12:05.186
No! No. I'm-a sit shotgun on this one.

12:05.219 --> 12:08.290
Okay, Nomi, so,
as an ally of the struggle,

12:08.323 --> 12:10.693
would you consider
your <i> own</i> behavior problematic?

12:10.725 --> 12:11.826
Because <i> I</i> would.

12:11.859 --> 12:13.829
Some would say
you're very similar to Vivek.

12:13.862 --> 12:16.531
I mean, you hang out
with a mostly Black crew,

12:16.565 --> 12:18.300
you're rocking bamboo earrings...

12:18.333 --> 12:20.903
And apparently, now you give
lectures to Black people

12:20.935 --> 12:22.070
on how to stay woke.

12:22.103 --> 12:23.571
Mm.

12:23.604 --> 12:24.873
Oh, my God.

12:26.541 --> 12:28.710
I've failed as an ally of the diaspora.

12:28.743 --> 12:30.845
I'm sorry. I just
don't even see the big deal.

12:30.878 --> 12:33.581
Why can't people just dress
they that they want to dress

12:33.614 --> 12:35.084
or talk the way they want to talk

12:35.117 --> 12:37.086
or do their hair
the way they want to do it?

12:37.118 --> 12:39.555
I mean, I don't care
that Doug is always dressed

12:39.588 --> 12:41.557
like my 50-year-old Cuban Uncle Pepe.

12:41.589 --> 12:44.660
Imitation is the highest form
of flattery.

12:44.693 --> 12:46.361
Okay, there is nothing flattering

12:46.393 --> 12:48.429
about picking and choosing
elements of my life

12:48.463 --> 12:49.732
that you want to take.

12:49.765 --> 12:52.901
My body, my music, my hairstyles.

12:52.934 --> 12:54.937
All of a sudden,
all of these White girls

12:54.969 --> 12:57.372
are rocking cornrows and want
to call 'em boxer braids,

12:57.405 --> 12:58.774
and everyone's acting
like they're making

12:58.806 --> 13:00.041
a brand-new trend or something.

13:00.075 --> 13:01.776
Then <i> we're</i> the ones
who get penalized for it.

13:01.810 --> 13:02.811
Yeah.

13:04.613 --> 13:05.613
Okay, okay.

13:05.647 --> 13:07.849
But isn't Black culture so much bigger

13:07.882 --> 13:10.551
than cornrows and unlaced sneakers?

13:10.584 --> 13:12.387
I mean, it feels like you guys

13:12.420 --> 13:14.423
are minimizing the entire culture

13:14.455 --> 13:16.758
by focusing on something
so... so trivial.

13:16.791 --> 13:19.393
But it's not trivial to <i> us...</i> at all...

13:19.426 --> 13:20.928
because it's all we got.

13:20.961 --> 13:22.930
This is a culture
that we've been forced to create

13:22.964 --> 13:24.767
because the first one
was robbed from us,

13:24.800 --> 13:27.603
and now it feels like we're
at risk of losing it again.

13:27.636 --> 13:28.904
Wait, wait. Hol... Hold up.

13:28.936 --> 13:31.806
How is it that you can
clearly see the problem

13:31.839 --> 13:34.142
but you don't see what Vivek is doing?

13:34.176 --> 13:36.411
'Cause I don't think
he's doing anything wrong.

13:36.444 --> 13:37.913
Okay.

13:37.945 --> 13:39.981
So if you don't think <i>
he's</i> doing anything wrong,

13:40.015 --> 13:41.150
I'm-a just go check him myself.

13:41.182 --> 13:42.817
No, Doug. Whoa, whoa. Wait.

13:42.850 --> 13:44.452
What are you gonna do...
walk up to him and say,

13:44.485 --> 13:46.154
"Hey, Vivek, stop trying to be Black"?

13:46.187 --> 13:47.188
What?

13:50.791 --> 13:52.827
You guys feel like
I'm trying to act Black?

13:52.860 --> 13:54.395
Huh? No. What?

13:54.429 --> 13:55.764
We're just... It's fine.

13:55.796 --> 13:57.733
Nah, nah, nah, it's not fine.

13:57.766 --> 13:59.134
Yo, look, man.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.069
There's just a few things about you

14:01.102 --> 14:03.172
that don't sit right with me.

14:03.204 --> 14:05.840
Like the whole wave cap business

14:05.873 --> 14:09.510
and some of your language and...

14:09.544 --> 14:12.180
you use the Black
Santa Claus emoji, bro.

14:12.214 --> 14:13.815
You can't do that.

14:15.450 --> 14:16.517
Wow.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.853
I'm, uh...

14:17.886 --> 14:19.921
I'm so sorry.

14:19.954 --> 14:22.825
It was never my intention
to hurt anybody.

14:22.858 --> 14:25.828
And if I'm making anybody feel
uncomfortable, I'll fall back.

14:25.860 --> 14:27.428
Know what?

14:27.461 --> 14:29.363
I'll even move out of Hawkins.

14:29.397 --> 14:30.431
Deuces.

14:30.464 --> 14:31.867
I mean...

14:31.900 --> 14:32.868
goodbye.

14:32.901 --> 14:33.902
Vivek.

14:35.536 --> 14:36.772
Vivek, come on...

14:40.457 --> 14:43.777
<i>So, Cameo's enthusiastic
"yes to the dress"</i>

14:43.802 --> 14:46.681
<i>was more of a "meh, sure,
whatever to the dress."</i>

14:46.714 --> 14:49.283
<i>And after my styling disaster
with the twins,</i>

14:49.316 --> 14:50.852
<i>I'd promised myself</i>

14:50.886 --> 14:54.389
<i>I'd never let a client
walk away unhappy again.</i>

14:55.556 --> 14:57.458
Oh. Hey, Cameo. Good morning.

14:57.483 --> 15:01.229
Hey. I saw all your missed
calls and texts

15:01.262 --> 15:03.965
saying you... wanted to see me...

15:03.998 --> 15:05.733
at 1:30 in the morning.

15:05.767 --> 15:07.201
Yeah. Uh, no.

15:07.234 --> 15:09.570
Thanks for not reporting that
to any adults.

15:09.603 --> 15:11.806
Okay, listen, uh,
I had a couple thoughts

15:11.839 --> 15:12.907
about your prom dress,

15:12.940 --> 15:15.576
and it's just really
got me thinking that...

15:15.609 --> 15:18.180
You know, I just don't think
I quite nailed it for you yet.

15:18.213 --> 15:20.147
And because this is your prom,

15:20.180 --> 15:23.752
I really do feel like I really
gotta nail this.

15:23.785 --> 15:25.988
For <i> you,</i> o-of course.

15:26.021 --> 15:28.724
I mean... sure. I guess.

15:28.757 --> 15:31.325
O-Okay, I can work with an "I guess."

15:34.930 --> 15:36.397
Nice.

15:36.430 --> 15:37.932
Nice.

15:37.965 --> 15:40.101
"Nice."

15:40.134 --> 15:41.435
Okay.

15:41.469 --> 15:43.238
This?

15:43.271 --> 15:44.640
Great.

15:46.074 --> 15:47.776
"Great."

15:47.809 --> 15:49.177
Ooh.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.711
This one is it.

15:55.483 --> 15:56.484
It's cute.

15:57.618 --> 15:58.786
Mnh-mnh.

16:00.254 --> 16:02.390
I'm sorry... Cameo, this dress...

16:02.424 --> 16:04.358
this dress is not <i> cute.</i>

16:04.392 --> 16:06.627
This dress is <i> amazing.</i>

16:06.661 --> 16:08.930
It is a vintage beaded gown
worn by Cher.

16:08.964 --> 16:11.032
Matter of fact, I actually had to
lie to the guy at the rental house

16:11.065 --> 16:13.868
and tell him I was Sasha Obama
so he would let me take it.

16:13.901 --> 16:17.372
My point is... this dress
is friggin' beautiful!

16:17.405 --> 16:19.475
To <i> you,</i> maybe. But not to me.

16:20.809 --> 16:23.078
It's just not who I am.

16:27.815 --> 16:29.017
Um...

16:31.085 --> 16:32.720
Wow.

16:32.753 --> 16:33.988
This whole time,

16:34.022 --> 16:37.492
I've just been feeding her
options that work for <i> me,</i>

16:37.525 --> 16:40.095
but I've never once stopped to ask...

16:41.296 --> 16:43.765
Who are you?

16:57.545 --> 16:58.981
Don't worry, man.

16:59.013 --> 17:02.016
Just came to pick up
my satin pillowcase.

17:02.050 --> 17:03.518
It's good for my waves.

17:03.551 --> 17:06.186
Yeah. I know.

17:06.221 --> 17:07.790
Right.

17:09.124 --> 17:10.826
Yo, Vivek.

17:10.858 --> 17:12.461
Stop, man.

17:14.029 --> 17:16.631
Look, it was never my intention

17:16.664 --> 17:19.001
to have you bounce from Hawkins, man.

17:19.032 --> 17:21.203
I was just trying to put you
up on game. That's it.

17:21.234 --> 17:22.204
Yeah, well, I can assure you,

17:22.236 --> 17:24.005
I've never been more
"up on game" in my life.

17:24.039 --> 17:25.839
Hey, I'm killin'
the "up on game" game right now.

17:25.874 --> 17:27.509
O-Okay, I'm... I'm sorry, man.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.846
Look... maybe I <i> was</i> too harsh.

17:30.878 --> 17:33.814
You know, I'm the new dude here,
so who knows?

17:33.848 --> 17:36.118
Maybe the people in the crew
know you more than I do

17:36.150 --> 17:37.852
and you were just being yourself.

17:37.886 --> 17:40.187
Nah.

17:40.221 --> 17:41.890
Not entirely.

17:41.923 --> 17:45.359
Truth is, I've always
struggled with who I am.

17:45.393 --> 17:46.995
All this extra stuff, you know...

17:47.028 --> 17:49.664
the labels, the drug dealing, it's...

17:49.696 --> 17:51.132
it's all part of running away

17:51.166 --> 17:53.234
from the poor, nerdy kid
who never fit in.

17:54.502 --> 17:56.238
So, yeah, you know,
maybe I did borrow some things

17:56.271 --> 17:58.005
from the people here at Hawkins,

17:58.039 --> 18:01.176
but not because I was trying
to steal anything, you know?

18:01.208 --> 18:03.077
I just think you guys are...

18:03.110 --> 18:05.147
dope.

18:05.179 --> 18:07.548
I-I get it.

18:07.581 --> 18:09.583
Black people fly as [bleep], man.

18:13.187 --> 18:14.255
So, bottom line is, you know,

18:14.289 --> 18:16.157
when Aaron invited me to crash here,

18:16.191 --> 18:17.993
everybody embraced me like I was family.

18:18.025 --> 18:20.528
I felt like I belonged, so, yeah,

18:20.561 --> 18:22.531
I guess I did get
a little too comfortable,

18:22.563 --> 18:25.199
but only because I felt like
I was part of the community.

18:25.233 --> 18:27.536
No, bro, you <i> are...</i> definitely.

18:27.569 --> 18:29.070
It's just...

18:29.104 --> 18:31.206
some things are

18:31.239 --> 18:35.177
maybe more reserved for <i> my</i> community.

18:35.210 --> 18:37.046
Exclusively, you know?

18:38.413 --> 18:40.714
I get it.

18:40.747 --> 18:43.384
You should probably have this.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.052
Ohhh.

18:45.086 --> 18:47.122
No. I-I-I should not.

18:47.155 --> 18:50.291
Uh, but you could pocket the wave cap

18:50.324 --> 18:53.094
and, you know, put your little
satin lady pillow down

18:53.127 --> 18:54.229
and come over here

18:54.262 --> 18:57.166
and get molly-whopped
in some bones, man.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.401
I'd loved to get
molly-whopped by you, man.

19:00.435 --> 19:01.802
Come on.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.772
Oh. Hugs. Okay.

19:03.804 --> 19:05.974
Ay, these [bleep] in here huggin', yo!

19:06.006 --> 19:07.241
Uh-huh. I seen that.

19:07.274 --> 19:08.976
Shoulder-to-shoulder, nipple-to-nipple.

19:09.010 --> 19:11.579
Y'all are nasty.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.750
Come on.

19:25.092 --> 19:26.327
It's amazing.

19:29.364 --> 19:31.800
You heard it here first, folks.

19:31.832 --> 19:36.904
The streets love the
Zoey Johnson Styling Experience.

19:38.872 --> 19:41.342
Now, let's just pray that when
Luca gets back from New York,

19:41.376 --> 19:43.011
he does <i> not</i> notice

19:43.043 --> 19:44.845
the very expensive bespoke red tux

19:44.878 --> 19:48.349
that he wore to freshman formal
is missing from his closet.

19:48.383 --> 19:50.152
<i>Sometimes in life,</i>

19:50.185 --> 19:52.320
<i>fitting in isn't always the best,</i>

19:52.352 --> 19:55.089
<i>because it can prevent us
from standing out</i>

19:55.122 --> 19:58.459
<i>and shining
as our true, authentic selves.</i>

20:04.232 --> 20:06.368
<i>But other times,</i>

20:06.400 --> 20:08.802
<i>it's exactly what we need
to get the sense of community</i>

20:08.836 --> 20:12.207
<i>that makes us feel like
we're part of something bigger,</i>

20:12.240 --> 20:13.474
<i>something special.</i>

20:15.611 --> 20:18.254
- Take that one time.
- Set me up.

20:18.279 --> 20:19.910
Hey, hey, man, something's bothering me.

20:19.935 --> 20:21.649
Is there something in my nose?

20:21.683 --> 20:23.350
- What?
- Uh, no, I don't see anything.

20:23.384 --> 20:24.553
Me, neither.

20:24.586 --> 20:26.354
Oh, wait, sorry. I don't mean <i> that</i> nose.

20:26.387 --> 20:28.322
I mean my domi-nose, bitch! Unh!

20:28.356 --> 20:30.959
Are you kidding me?
We should've never let him stay.

20:30.992 --> 20:32.226
We shouldn't have.

20:32.260 --> 20:35.329
Hey. I've been outside
for, like, 30 minutes.

20:35.362 --> 20:36.797
What happened to Wave Cap Wednesdays?

20:36.830 --> 20:38.632
Pfft, [bleep], today is Thursday!

20:38.666 --> 20:40.368
Thursday?!

20:40.400 --> 20:42.336
Y'all made me waste a wave cap!

20:48.108 --> 20:49.310
Ay!

20:50.305 --> 20:56.426
