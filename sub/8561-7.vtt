00:07.774 --> 00:14.737
I've seen death. I've seen my friends,
my men, being killed.

00:14.948 --> 00:21.365
And this is— It doesn't take
too many days of that…

00:21.579 --> 00:24.829
and you change dramatically.

00:25.082 --> 00:28.831
We had no food, didn't have
ammunition. It was cold.

00:29.086 --> 00:34.127
We didn't have clothes. If you built
a fire, something would shoot at you.

00:34.383 --> 00:37.882
Everywhere you look,
you would see dead people.

00:38.095 --> 00:41.214
A dead soldier there, here.
Ours, theirs.

00:41.431 --> 00:46.508
Then civilians, besides…
Dead animals.

00:46.769 --> 00:49.058
So death was all over.

00:49.314 --> 00:54.604
You don't have a chance,
when your friends go down…

00:54.819 --> 00:59.445
to really take care of them
as you might.

00:59.698 --> 01:05.819
And especially if you're under attack,
moving or whatever, and…

01:07.081 --> 01:10.449
I withstood it well…

01:10.709 --> 01:16.249
but I had a lot of trouble
in later life…

01:16.464 --> 01:22.253
because those events
would come back…

01:22.470 --> 01:25.839
and you never forget them.

04:09.629 --> 04:11.207
After Bastogne…

04:11.423 --> 04:15.835
Easy Company was called
to push the Germans through the Bulge.

04:16.094 --> 04:19.344
We were here this morning.
We came this way.

04:19.596 --> 04:22.931
Here's the logging road
coming into here.

04:23.101 --> 04:25.638
–So you go right there.
–Take it easy!

04:25.895 --> 04:30.142
–Stop crying or I'll nail it to your head.
–It's made of wood.

04:30.316 --> 04:34.016
–Move them out.
–Yes, sir. 2nd Platoon, let's go.

04:34.278 --> 04:39.616
I was glad to be out of my foxhole
and moving, even if only to get warm.

04:39.867 --> 04:43.532
Spread out. Keep your interval.

04:49.751 --> 04:53.962
E Company was sent to clear
the woods near the town of Foy…

04:54.214 --> 04:58.959
in preparation for what we knew
would be the assault on Foy itself.

04:59.135 --> 05:00.250
I see it, Buck.

05:00.428 --> 05:03.132
Watch for mines.

05:04.932 --> 05:09.926
During that 1000-yard attack, we
encountered sporadic machine-gun fire…

05:10.104 --> 05:15.015
and had a couple casualties,
but overall met little resistance.

05:18.195 --> 05:22.275
Nelson! Look. Nelson!

05:23.742 --> 05:29.577
Hoobler's run-in with the German was
the most dramatic moment of the day.

05:37.755 --> 05:38.870
Halt!

05:40.966 --> 05:42.924
Halt!

06:06.616 --> 06:08.655
Oh, shit.

06:20.879 --> 06:22.504
Thank you.

06:27.886 --> 06:32.180
Hoobler had been talking
about getting a Luger since Normandy.

06:32.390 --> 06:35.724
He went from foxhole to foxhole
telling everyone.

06:35.935 --> 06:38.473
Down he goes like a sack of potatoes.

06:38.730 --> 06:42.644
Outstanding accuracy on my part,
if I do say so myself.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.308
–Which you do.
–Which I do.

06:45.570 --> 06:48.870
Shifty, I could've given you
a run for your money.

06:49.115 --> 06:53.029
No, I'm not a good shot.
Dad was an excellent shot.

06:53.285 --> 06:55.408
He'd shoot the wings off a fly.

06:55.663 --> 06:58.580
That German,
what'd you think he was doing?

06:58.832 --> 07:02.700
Recon. He must have figured
nobody'd hear a horse.

07:02.961 --> 07:05.666
He was just trying
to get out of Dodge.

07:05.922 --> 07:08.674
–What happened to the horse?
–Don't know.

07:08.884 --> 07:11.458
Probably still running.
Hope he's okay.

07:12.178 --> 07:15.013
–You dug in?
–Yeah, yeah.

07:15.265 --> 07:18.052
Just thought I'd take a walk.

07:18.309 --> 07:21.105
You're a good shot.
Glad you're on our side.

07:21.145 --> 07:22.972
Thanks, Lip.

07:23.231 --> 07:25.140
–Hey, Lip?
–Yeah.

07:25.358 --> 07:29.225
–Thanks for the help.
–You got it, Shifty.

07:29.486 --> 07:34.113
–Hey, Lip? You got a sec?
–Yes, sir.

07:36.285 --> 07:38.573
Give him a hand.

07:39.788 --> 07:42.705
–Where's Dike?
–He's around.

07:42.958 --> 07:46.825
–Could you be more specific, sergeant?
–Not really, sir.

07:47.087 --> 07:52.128
I haven't seen him all day and I have
to figure out how we ended up.

07:52.383 --> 07:54.957
–Two wounded.
–Who?

07:55.219 --> 07:59.169
–Brown and Stevenson.
–Goddamn it. Where's Dike?

07:59.432 --> 08:01.258
Where does he go?

08:01.517 --> 08:05.182
I don't know,
but I wish he'd stay there.

08:05.437 --> 08:08.687
–Shut up, boys.
–Shutting up, sarge.

08:09.066 --> 08:11.023
What the hell was that?

08:12.444 --> 08:16.524
–Patrol?
–No, we would've heard.

08:16.782 --> 08:19.818
–One man, maybe a sniper.
–That was no rifle.

08:20.076 --> 08:23.113
–What do you see, Shift?
–Nobody out there.

08:23.371 --> 08:25.198
–Are you sure?
–Uh-huh.

08:25.415 --> 08:28.119
–It's Hoob. He's shot!
–Sniper?

08:28.376 --> 08:32.788
–No, no, he, he shot himself.
–Medic!

08:33.047 --> 08:34.789
–What happened?
–Doc.

08:35.049 --> 08:36.460
It's my fucking leg.

08:36.674 --> 08:40.424
–You'll be all right.
–It just went off.

08:40.679 --> 08:46.053
What are you doing with a loaded gun
in your pants? Damn it! Goddamn it!

08:46.226 --> 08:48.266
–I wasn't touching it.
–Medic!

08:48.520 --> 08:52.185
–Where are you hit?
–In my leg.

08:52.357 --> 08:56.900
–Take it easy, buddy.
–Don't look, Hoob. It'll be fine.

08:57.112 --> 09:00.527
–Hurts like a son of a bitch.
–It's gonna be okay.

09:00.782 --> 09:03.699
–Doc!
–Don't worry about it, Hoob.

09:03.868 --> 09:07.782
–You'll be all right. You hear me?
–Warm him up!

09:08.039 --> 09:09.497
Keep him warm.

09:09.749 --> 09:13.793
–How's it looking, doc?
–Let me see it.

09:14.044 --> 09:17.994
Can we get him some blankets
or something?

09:18.257 --> 09:21.423
–Keep talking to him.
–Listen to me, it's okay.

09:21.635 --> 09:23.793
Think it was a German leg?

09:24.012 --> 09:27.381
–It's not that bad.
–You're gonna be fine.

09:27.641 --> 09:30.476
Hold on. Put this across him.

09:30.685 --> 09:35.098
–Wrap him up. Wrap him up.
–Here you go. Here you go.

09:35.356 --> 09:41.311
–Lip, you said I was a great shot?
–You are. You're a great shot.

09:41.571 --> 09:44.690
You jump out of planes.
You're tough, man.

09:44.949 --> 09:47.700
–It's not that bad.
–Stay with us, Hoob.

09:47.952 --> 09:50.953
–It's all right.
–Doc, what are we gonna do?

09:51.205 --> 09:54.656
–How we doing, doc?
–I can't see a thing.

09:54.917 --> 10:00.955
–Let's get ready to move him.
–Relax, take it easy. Take it easy.

10:01.214 --> 10:03.705
Doc. Doc!

10:15.978 --> 10:18.054
Perc, I'll need a jeep.

10:23.861 --> 10:28.938
He was wearing so many clothes we
couldn't tell how bad he was bleeding.

10:29.116 --> 10:34.358
He was already dead. The bullet
cut the main artery in his leg.

10:34.621 --> 10:39.082
It wouldn't have made a difference
if you had known.

10:39.292 --> 10:42.708
Cut that main artery
in the leg, that's it.

10:42.962 --> 10:49.581
Yes, sir. I'm gonna go back and make
sure the boys are all dug in, sir.

10:49.844 --> 10:55.431
–Lip? Where's Dike?
–You want to see him, sir?

10:55.683 --> 10:59.930
No, I just would have expected
this kind of news from him.

11:00.187 --> 11:04.979
Well, I was there, sir.
Figured it might as well be me.

11:17.245 --> 11:21.788
Where's Dike? I probably heard
that question a thousand times…

11:22.000 --> 11:24.954
and I probably asked it
a few times myself.

11:25.211 --> 11:30.252
There were long stretches where we
didn't know where Lieutenant Dike was.

11:30.424 --> 11:32.666
He'd disappear for hours.

11:32.927 --> 11:36.592
It wouldn't have been bad
if he was one of the guys…

11:36.764 --> 11:40.713
but he was supposed to be
leading the company.

11:41.101 --> 11:44.850
Captain Winters was a CO
we could all respect.

11:45.022 --> 11:48.106
Moose Heyliger would have done
a good job…

11:48.275 --> 11:51.940
but he was accidentally shot
by a sentry.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.985
Then came Norman Dike.

11:54.239 --> 11:58.023
I want security around the company CP.

11:58.284 --> 12:01.534
Dike wasn't bad
because he made bad decisions…

12:01.704 --> 12:04.788
he was bad
because he made no decisions.

12:04.999 --> 12:08.747
Battalion S3 is planning a move…

12:08.919 --> 12:12.917
so I will probably
be called away regularly.

12:13.132 --> 12:14.674
Any questions?

12:14.925 --> 12:20.264
Yeah. What's the formation
you're wanting us to go for?

12:21.014 --> 12:26.601
At present, as per usual, but I'll
clarify that with you at a later time.

12:26.853 --> 12:28.762
Yes, sir.

12:31.357 --> 12:34.192
I gotta make a call.

12:41.575 --> 12:44.612
–Let's move it out.
–Right.

12:48.123 --> 12:51.077
Dike was a favorite
of somebody at Division.

12:51.251 --> 12:54.786
He'd been sent down
to get combat experience.

12:54.963 --> 12:58.379
It seemed like E Company
was an annoyance to him.

12:58.550 --> 13:03.377
Something he had to get through
before he could continue up the ladder.

13:03.638 --> 13:07.683
–We're screwed.
–I'm glad Dike's never around.

13:07.934 --> 13:12.596
You know what? We're doing all right,
even with Foxhole Norman.

13:12.855 --> 13:16.354
We're doing all right now.
In case you ain't noticed…

13:16.609 --> 13:20.903
there's a town over there, right?
In that town are Germans.

13:21.113 --> 13:23.402
–These Germans got tanks.
–I know.

13:23.574 --> 13:26.676
And our side's gonna want
to go into that town.

13:26.910 --> 13:30.575
Guess who they're gonna want
to go knock on the door?

13:30.831 --> 13:34.365
I know, all right? It's me you're
talking to here.

13:34.626 --> 13:40.296
We gotta do all this with a CO
who's got his head so far up his ass…

13:40.507 --> 13:43.875
that lump in his throat
is his goddamn nose.

13:44.135 --> 13:46.970
–Hey, first sergeant.
–Hey, boys.

13:47.221 --> 13:50.341
–Hey, Lip.
–Hey, Muck, what's the word?

13:50.600 --> 13:56.887
Sitting around freezing our ass off,
singing Dike's praises.

13:57.147 --> 14:00.766
Oh, yeah. Lieutenant Dike.

14:01.985 --> 14:05.734
Well, I'll tell you…

14:05.948 --> 14:09.316
I wouldn't want to be
a replacement officer here.

14:09.576 --> 14:14.950
Get thrown in with guys who've
known each other for what, two years?

14:15.832 --> 14:19.082
You've been in combat together
since Normandy.

14:19.335 --> 14:25.338
He's supposed to just show up
and lead them? How does a guy do that?

14:25.591 --> 14:30.549
How could anyone really hope
to gain respect of the toughest…

14:30.763 --> 14:37.015
most professional, most dedicated
sons of bitches in the entire ETO?

14:37.227 --> 14:41.972
If you ask me, a guy'd have
to march off to Berlin…

14:42.190 --> 14:46.686
and come back
with Hitler's mustache or something.

14:49.447 --> 14:54.987
Anyway, listen. You guys don't worry
about Dike. All right?

14:55.244 --> 14:56.620
Yeah.

14:56.829 --> 15:00.578
We all do our jobs,
everything'll be fine.

15:04.795 --> 15:07.369
–See you, sarge.
–Yeah, boy.

15:08.382 --> 15:13.174
I don't know if I believed that,
but as first sergeant, it was my job.

15:13.345 --> 15:17.971
Not to protect Dike, but to protect
the integrity of the company.

15:18.225 --> 15:21.261
You know what Dike's problem is,
don't you?

15:21.436 --> 15:24.390
He's another arrogant, rich jerk
from Yale.

15:24.648 --> 15:28.312
Oh, God, not another one of those.

15:30.695 --> 15:35.357
Division wouldn't let me replace him
just because I got a bad feeling.

15:35.533 --> 15:38.949
Even if they would,
who'd I put in his place?

15:39.912 --> 15:40.943
Shames?

15:41.205 --> 15:43.119
Do not talk when I'm talking!

15:43.332 --> 15:46.167
Shames has seen too many war movies.

15:46.418 --> 15:50.463
You crapheads did not listen
to a word I said, did you?

15:51.548 --> 15:52.579
Or Peacock?

15:52.841 --> 15:57.218
He tries hard, but he's not cut out
to take men into combat.

15:57.387 --> 16:02.428
I'm not making him Company CO when
I don't want him as a platoon leader.

16:02.684 --> 16:06.977
–What about Compton?
–He's the only real choice.

16:08.106 --> 16:11.272
Buck's a real combat leader,
but you know…

16:12.693 --> 16:16.987
I want Easy to have
at least one experienced platoon leader.

16:17.156 --> 16:21.236
Not that it matters anyway,
because I can't get rid of Dike.

16:23.203 --> 16:27.331
We all know who you'd like
to have running Easy.

16:27.582 --> 16:30.749
Trouble is,
it's not your job anymore, Dick.

16:31.002 --> 16:34.288
You've gotta find somebody.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.923
We agreed Buck would've been
the best choice…

16:44.098 --> 16:47.432
if Winters had been able to
get rid of Dike.

16:49.020 --> 16:53.480
But Buck wasn't the same
as before he got shot in Holland.

16:53.649 --> 16:55.227
He was more serious.

16:55.401 --> 16:58.604
–He had a Luger in his pants.
–Jesus.

16:58.862 --> 17:03.109
Don't you two do something
stupid like that, all right?

17:03.367 --> 17:06.319
–We'll try not to, Buck.
–I mean it.

17:06.536 --> 17:09.241
And you, Wild Bill.

17:09.455 --> 17:14.994
I've invested too much goddamn time
shaping you into something useful.

17:15.252 --> 17:19.582
–You do something crazy—
–I know, you'll kill me.

17:19.840 --> 17:23.007
Even if you're dead,
I'll still kill you.

17:23.928 --> 17:27.795
I'll see you later.
I'm gonna check on the other guys.

17:32.478 --> 17:36.143
–Crazy Joe McCloskey.
–What?

17:36.356 --> 17:40.568
This guy used to hang out at Delancey's
and stare at people.

17:40.819 --> 17:46.489
I know who Crazy Joe is.
What's that got to do with anything?

17:46.741 --> 17:49.197
Buck kind of reminds me of him now.

17:50.119 --> 17:54.497
–What?
–Ever since he got shot in Holland.

17:54.665 --> 18:00.454
Wait. What are you saying, he's nuts?
Because Crazy Joe was nuts.

18:00.629 --> 18:03.666
I'm not saying he's nuts.
I'm just saying…

18:03.841 --> 18:06.047
What? What are you saying?

18:06.302 --> 18:07.879
–Forget it.
–What?

18:08.137 --> 18:11.173
Forget it.
Come on, you've seen him, Bill.

18:11.390 --> 18:16.597
–He's all wound up like a spring.
–Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's fine.

18:19.147 --> 18:23.358
It wasn't getting shot that got him,
it was that hospital.

18:23.610 --> 18:28.900
–I've been there, okay? It ain't pretty.
–Yeah.

18:29.115 --> 18:33.326
Besides, once he was up and around,
he was his old self again.

18:34.495 --> 18:37.994
I'm telling you, Buck Compton's fine.

18:40.167 --> 18:42.543
–I'm serious.
–Sure. Nothing stupid.

18:42.795 --> 18:45.795
–We got it, right?
–We got it.

18:46.048 --> 18:48.420
All right. George?

18:51.094 --> 18:53.502
Nothing stupid, Buck.

19:00.770 --> 19:02.976
Who is he talking to?

19:03.147 --> 19:08.521
Morons who volunteered to jump out of a
good airplane. Can you get more stupid?

19:08.694 --> 19:10.936
–Probably not.
–Right.

19:11.197 --> 19:14.815
–I swum across the Niagara once.
–Yeah.

19:16.744 --> 19:21.701
–I swear. On a bet.
–What, in a barrel?

19:21.957 --> 19:25.907
No. I didn't go over the falls.
I swam across the river.

19:26.169 --> 19:28.743
–I don't know.
–Ten miles up.

19:29.005 --> 19:31.461
–That current is damn strong.
–Yeah.

19:31.675 --> 19:36.502
Must have carried me two miles
downstream, but I got across.

19:36.763 --> 19:40.677
Now, personally, I didn't think
it was all that stupid…

19:40.933 --> 19:45.476
but my mom, my sister Ruth,
they gave me all kinds of hell.

19:45.730 --> 19:48.814
–Yeah, I bet, Muck.
–So did Faye.

19:49.066 --> 19:52.565
–Sweet Faye Tanner.
–Shut it, George.

19:52.820 --> 19:56.438
They had a point. You're an idiot.

20:16.342 --> 20:20.755
I heard about Hoobler. Shame.

20:21.389 --> 20:24.639
Yes, sir. It is.

20:25.851 --> 20:28.389
–Is that the Luger?
–Yes, it is.

20:28.645 --> 20:32.857
–What are you gonna do with it?
–I don't know yet.

20:34.401 --> 20:40.273
–Where you from? Where'd you grow up?
–Huntington, West Virginia.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.111
–Huntington?
–Yes, sir.

20:43.368 --> 20:46.037
I don't know it.

20:46.287 --> 20:49.537
What kind of work did you do there?

20:49.791 --> 20:53.491
My brother and I helped my mom
run a boarding house.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.911
And your father?

20:58.382 --> 21:04.752
He was killed when I was 10, sir.
Automobile accident.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.139
That's sad.

21:13.396 --> 21:16.168
Why'd you decide
to join the paratroopers?

21:16.191 --> 21:19.891
I read an article about paratroopers
in Life.

21:20.111 --> 21:23.231
Talked about the training,
how hard it was.

21:23.448 --> 21:27.825
It said if you wanted to make it,
you had to be the best.

21:28.077 --> 21:30.783
And I wanted to fight
with the best, sir.

21:31.038 --> 21:33.446
You miss it?

21:33.707 --> 21:36.494
–Miss what?
–Huntington.

21:39.588 --> 21:44.499
Honestly, sir, I try not to think
about it that much.

21:47.179 --> 21:49.088
Where are you from, s—?

22:08.741 --> 22:12.904
–Captain Nixon, sir? Captain Nixon?
–What?

22:13.704 --> 22:17.452
Sorry to disturb you.
This came from Division.

22:20.627 --> 22:22.002
All right.

22:25.882 --> 22:28.836
–Morning.
–Eviction notice?

22:29.094 --> 22:32.509
Something that'll help
your leadership problem.

22:32.764 --> 22:36.049
–Dike's transferred?
–I can't help with that.

22:36.309 --> 22:40.472
Division has decided to pluck
one officer from each regiment…

22:40.730 --> 22:45.391
that served in Bastogne, send him
to the States on a 30-day furlough…

22:45.609 --> 22:49.025
get him banging the drum
for the war bond drive.

22:49.279 --> 22:52.066
Turns out I've been plucked.

22:54.618 --> 22:58.366
–That's fantastic, Lew. Good for you.
–Thank you.

22:58.622 --> 23:01.526
–How does your leaving help?
–I'm not going.

23:01.708 --> 23:05.326
I've seen the States.
That's why I came to Europe.

23:05.587 --> 23:10.544
Wish they'd told me there was a war.
Anyway, this thing's wasted on me.

23:10.717 --> 23:15.295
But I'm sure we could find an officer
who could use a trip home.

23:16.555 --> 23:20.470
Peacock, I can't think of anybody
who deserves this more.

23:20.726 --> 23:22.304
Thanks.

23:23.646 --> 23:28.354
–Really glad that you're going home.
–Best news I've heard in weeks.

23:28.609 --> 23:30.019
Hell of a guy.

23:30.235 --> 23:33.438
Thanks, guys.
It really means a lot, you know?

23:33.697 --> 23:37.315
Get out of here.
Three cheers for Lt Peacock.

23:37.575 --> 23:41.787
Hip, hip, hooray. Hip, hip, hooray.
Hip, hip, hooray.

23:54.717 --> 23:57.357
If they come here,
smile for the camera.

23:57.595 --> 24:00.465
Got to keep morale up
for folks back home.

24:00.681 --> 24:04.429
–Why?
–Damned if I know.

24:04.643 --> 24:07.181
What's waiting for us in Foy?

24:07.437 --> 24:11.304
At least one company
from the 10th Panzer Grenadiers.

24:11.566 --> 24:15.943
They've got one 88, although
we haven't been able to spot it.

24:16.196 --> 24:19.113
–Armor?
–As of last night, three Tigers.

24:19.365 --> 24:22.152
–Would you excuse me a moment, sir?
–Yeah.

24:22.368 --> 24:25.571
How do I feel
about being rescued by Patton?

24:25.830 --> 24:29.578
Well, I'd feel peachy
if it wasn't for one thing.

24:29.792 --> 24:34.086
We didn't need to be fucking rescued
by Patton. You got that?

24:34.338 --> 24:35.500
–Joe.
–Sir.

24:35.672 --> 24:37.712
Excuse us for a moment.

24:37.966 --> 24:39.045
Sorry, sir.

24:39.259 --> 24:43.304
Sorry about what? Patton?
I couldn't agree more.

24:43.555 --> 24:46.840
–What are you doing?
–I want to head back.

24:47.100 --> 24:50.967
You don't have to.
Get back to the aid station.

24:51.146 --> 24:54.680
I'd really like to head back
with the fellas, sir.

24:56.859 --> 25:01.568
–All right, then go.
–Thank you, sir.

25:05.743 --> 25:09.076
Joe had been at the aid station
for three days…

25:09.288 --> 25:13.665
and everybody was glad
to have him back. Especially Bill.

25:13.876 --> 25:15.334
–Hey, Joe.
–Hey, Bill.

25:15.544 --> 25:20.122
–What you doing back here?
–Making sure you're on top of things.

25:20.382 --> 25:25.838
I'm on top of things. Tied me own boots
once last week. All by me-self.

25:26.012 --> 25:30.341
–Look who I found.
–Joe Toye, back for more.

25:30.516 --> 25:31.797
How are you, Joe?

25:31.976 --> 25:35.926
–Good. Escaped from the aid station.
–Where'd you get hit?

25:36.105 --> 25:38.940
–What's that?
–It's Webb. Replacement.

25:39.191 --> 25:43.520
Thought it was some guy I've known
for years and forgot.

25:43.779 --> 25:47.527
Joe got hit in the arm.
Gift from the Luftwaffe.

25:47.783 --> 25:50.986
–Lot of you been injured?
–It's called wounded.

25:51.203 --> 25:53.777
Injured is when you fall out
of a tree.

25:54.039 --> 25:58.286
There's enough crap flying around,
you're bound to get dinged.

25:58.501 --> 26:02.119
Almost every one of these guys
have been hit once.

26:02.380 --> 26:06.841
Except Alley. He's a two-timer.
He landed on broken glass…

26:07.051 --> 26:09.803
and got peppered
by a potato masher.

26:10.054 --> 26:13.505
Bull got a piece
of exploding tank in Holland.

26:13.724 --> 26:18.350
And George Luz here has never been hit.
You're one lucky bastard.

26:18.604 --> 26:22.055
–Takes one to know one.
–Consider us blessed.

26:22.274 --> 26:26.272
Liebgott got pinked
in the neck in Holland.

26:26.528 --> 26:29.149
Next to him, that's Popeye.

26:29.364 --> 26:33.231
He got shot in his scrawny
little butt in Normandy.

26:33.493 --> 26:37.111
Buck got shot in his rather large butt
in Holland.

26:37.372 --> 26:41.239
Easy Company tradition,
getting shot in the ass.

26:41.459 --> 26:46.880
Even 1st Sgt Lipton, he got
a couple pieces of tank shell burst.

26:47.131 --> 26:51.757
One chunk in the face.
Another chunk almost took out his nuts.

26:52.011 --> 26:58.891
–How are those nuts, sarge?
–Doing fine, Bill. Nice of you to ask.

27:00.894 --> 27:06.813
On January 3rd, most of E Company
headed to our old position in the woods.

27:07.067 --> 27:11.978
A few men remained attached
to D Company to hold the line.

27:12.614 --> 27:14.653
Good luck, ladies.

27:15.783 --> 27:17.610
Been nice knowing you.

27:18.619 --> 27:23.107
–Wouldn't drink if I were you.
–Be careful if he offers a cigarette.

27:23.290 --> 27:25.449
If who offers us a cigarette?

27:25.668 --> 27:27.376
–Speirs.
–Who?

27:27.628 --> 27:30.119
Lieutenant Speirs.

27:31.965 --> 27:37.256
Lieutenant Ronald Speirs was one of the
platoon leaders. He was a legend.

27:38.138 --> 27:43.345
–The stories are all bullshit anyway.
–What stories?

27:43.518 --> 27:44.846
What stories?

27:45.020 --> 27:48.684
Supposedly Speirs shot one
of his men for being drunk.

27:48.857 --> 27:52.142
You're kidding! That's unbelievable.

27:52.360 --> 27:56.856
There's another one about him
giving cigarettes to 20 POWs…

27:57.114 --> 28:00.697
before killing them.
–He shot 20 POWs?

28:00.910 --> 28:02.986
I heard it was 30.

28:03.204 --> 28:06.204
–Christenson.
–Lieutenant Speirs.

28:06.457 --> 28:09.825
–I got the name right, didn't I?
–Yes, sir.

28:11.295 --> 28:16.122
–What are you men doing out here?
–We're watching the line, sir.

28:17.801 --> 28:20.588
You might want
to reinforce your cover.

28:20.845 --> 28:23.004
Lieutenant Dike said not to.

28:23.264 --> 28:28.009
–That we're only gonna be here one day.
–Lieutenant Dike said that?

28:28.269 --> 28:31.270
Then forget what I said.

28:32.732 --> 28:34.274
Carry on.

28:37.695 --> 28:40.731
Anyone care for a smoke?

28:44.785 --> 28:46.908
You?

28:48.330 --> 28:51.165
Late in the afternoon
on January 3rd…

28:51.333 --> 28:54.748
we returned
to our old position in the woods.

28:54.919 --> 28:58.169
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

28:58.423 --> 29:01.340
Someone's gonna fucking die.

29:01.509 --> 29:06.550
Look at this shit! Those 1st Battalion
fuckers took a dump in my foxhole.

29:06.722 --> 29:10.138
Think they shit
in everyone's foxhole, Joe.

29:11.477 --> 29:15.344
I don't think they wanted
to spend much time aboveground.

29:17.232 --> 29:20.601
The Germans had been shelling
our old position.

29:20.861 --> 29:24.989
There were signs
of tree bursts everywhere.

29:25.240 --> 29:29.736
Light and noise discipline.
We're getting close.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.545
Across the field,
I could see enemy troops.

29:41.797 --> 29:46.839
I still couldn't see their artillery,
but I knew it was down there.

29:48.971 --> 29:52.719
The Krauts have been
pounding this area with 88s.

29:52.975 --> 29:58.431
–They got this whole stretch targeted.
–Maybe they've got a new target.

29:58.689 --> 30:00.895
–No, they're waiting.
–For what?

30:01.149 --> 30:05.063
–For us to reoccupy the position.
–We should fall back.

30:05.320 --> 30:10.658
It's our job to hold the line here.
We just need to fortify the covers.

30:10.909 --> 30:16.532
–If they've got us targeted, maybe—
–We hold the line here. Lipton's right.

30:16.789 --> 30:19.992
We're gonna strengthen our covers
and hang in.

30:20.209 --> 30:25.250
We're not gonna fall back.
Right, lieutenant?

30:27.299 --> 30:32.127
–Right, lieutenant?
–Fine. You all take care of it.

30:32.387 --> 30:35.092
I gotta go talk to Regiment.

30:37.392 --> 30:40.512
–We better get moving.
–Yeah.

30:43.606 --> 30:45.646
–Here you go.
–Thanks, Lip.

30:45.900 --> 30:50.028
–I'll get you more branches.
–I appreciate that.

31:12.717 --> 31:16.133
Incoming! Take cover!

31:18.807 --> 31:20.182
Take cover!

31:24.270 --> 31:25.895
They're 88s.

31:26.147 --> 31:28.186
Come on, find some cover!

31:28.399 --> 31:30.807
They've got us zeroed!

31:31.819 --> 31:35.899
Find some cover. Find a foxhole.
Come on, take cover!

31:36.156 --> 31:40.201
–Get in the holes.
–Take cover!

31:44.206 --> 31:45.997
Come on, find some cover!

31:49.502 --> 31:51.542
Take cover!

31:52.756 --> 31:54.214
Shit.

32:03.391 --> 32:07.803
Come on, find some cover.
Find some cover!

32:15.569 --> 32:18.523
For some reason,
all I could think about…

32:18.739 --> 32:21.739
was the Fourth of July
when I was a kid.

32:21.908 --> 32:26.451
I loved to make my own firecrackers,
cherry bombs, ladyfingers.

32:26.705 --> 32:32.410
I loved to blow up dirt clods and pop
bottles. Looked forward to it all year.

32:32.669 --> 32:38.789
That day, I saw the most awesome
display of firepower I'd ever seen.

32:39.050 --> 32:43.208
I wouldn't have laughed
if I'd known what happened to Joe Toye.

33:43.194 --> 33:46.942
–We should see if anybody's hit.
–That's what they want.

33:47.198 --> 33:50.401
Krauts will try to draw us
out in the open.

34:00.252 --> 34:05.626
Stay in your foxholes.
Stay in your foxholes!

34:05.841 --> 34:08.414
Can you walk? Find a foxhole.

34:08.717 --> 34:10.877
I gotta get up.

34:14.099 --> 34:16.304
I gotta get up.

34:18.393 --> 34:20.719
I gotta get up.

34:23.024 --> 34:25.431
I need my helmet.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.646
–I need help!
–You hear that?

34:29.905 --> 34:32.360
–I need help!
–Is that Joe?

34:34.284 --> 34:36.324
Yeah, I think that's Joe.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.658
Stay.

34:39.915 --> 34:44.873
–Stay down! Stay down!
–Stay down! Stay in your foxholes!

34:45.128 --> 34:49.042
–Stay in your foxholes!
–Help!

34:49.299 --> 34:54.210
–Help! Anyone there?
–Jesus.

34:54.429 --> 34:59.470
I gotta get up. I gotta get up.

35:01.394 --> 35:07.396
Shit. Come on, Joe. Come on, buddy.
Come on. Come on, pal.

35:07.566 --> 35:10.602
You said you'd get to the
States before me.

35:10.778 --> 35:13.529
You ain't going anywhere.
You're okay.

35:13.780 --> 35:17.481
–I gotta get my helmet!
–Forget it, Joe.

35:17.742 --> 35:21.526
–Anyone there? Help!
–Hang on.

35:23.915 --> 35:26.157
–Who's that?
–Heff! Babe!

35:26.417 --> 35:29.667
–Hang on.
–Come on, get me out of here, Lip!

35:31.464 --> 35:33.255
I gotta get to the hole!

35:33.424 --> 35:37.635
–I got you. Come on, Joe, I got you.
–I gotta get to the hole!

35:40.181 --> 35:41.972
Come on, Joe.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.309
Hang on.

35:45.686 --> 35:46.808
–You okay?
–Yeah.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.055
Come on. Come on!

35:49.231 --> 35:52.101
Think I overdid the
cover for my foxhole?

35:52.651 --> 35:56.565
–Incoming!
–Incoming!

35:57.697 --> 36:00.318
Take cover!

36:07.498 --> 36:10.582
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

36:10.835 --> 36:14.500
Guarno! You're gonna get bombed!
Come on! Come on!

36:14.755 --> 36:17.424
Move it, Bill! Move it.

36:18.550 --> 36:23.461
–Come on, Joe.
–Hold on, I'll be there! I'll help!

36:24.222 --> 36:26.796
No!

36:28.560 --> 36:30.552
Medic!

36:36.484 --> 36:40.351
During the second barrage,
I wasn't laughing anymore.

37:17.523 --> 37:18.554
Lip!

37:21.444 --> 37:23.732
Are you okay?

37:26.490 --> 37:28.946
Stay down!

37:29.201 --> 37:32.949
–You stay down!
–1st Sgt Lipton?

37:33.205 --> 37:37.499
You get things organized here.
I'm gonna go for help.

37:40.712 --> 37:43.333
What the fuck?

37:47.385 --> 37:49.710
–Where is he going?
–I don't know.

37:49.887 --> 37:52.639
Get Battalion on the line
to notify BAS.

37:52.807 --> 37:54.846
Battalion's up, Lip.

38:07.821 --> 38:10.277
Medic!

38:19.416 --> 38:22.831
Stay ready! They might
be trying to come through.

38:23.002 --> 38:25.048
–You okay, One Lung?
–Sergeant!

38:25.213 --> 38:26.665
How you doing, Popeye?

38:26.714 --> 38:29.834
Hundred percent ready
to kill Germans, Lip!

38:40.436 --> 38:43.389
–Doc, what can I do?
–Hold this.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.682
–You got a smoke?
–Yeah.

38:48.693 --> 38:54.032
Jesus. What's a guy gotta do
to get killed around here?

38:54.199 --> 38:57.532
–Bill, you go first.
–Whatever you say, doc.

38:57.744 --> 39:00.116
Over here. Take this man.

39:00.371 --> 39:05.496
–Hey, they got old Guarnere this time.
–We got you, soldier.

39:08.254 --> 39:10.081
Just lie back.

39:13.926 --> 39:17.591
Hey, Joe, I told you I'd beat
you back to the States.

39:18.931 --> 39:20.508
Hey, Lip.

39:23.727 --> 39:25.518
How's Buck?

39:26.771 --> 39:29.476
–Luz, how's Buck?
–He's fine.

39:29.733 --> 39:31.974
–You sure?
–Yes, he's fine.

39:32.485 --> 39:35.735
I think you should
probably go talk to him.

39:38.116 --> 39:39.907
All right.

39:49.585 --> 39:54.330
Some say Buck changed after
he was shot in Holland. Maybe.

39:54.590 --> 39:59.501
Something happened to him when he
saw Toye and Guarnere on the ground.

40:08.603 --> 40:13.561
The report said Compton was being
taken off because of bad trench foot.

40:13.733 --> 40:17.647
Didn't say anything about
him losing his friends.

40:23.784 --> 40:26.453
Buck was a great combat leader.

40:26.704 --> 40:29.907
He was wounded in Normandy
and again in Holland.

40:30.082 --> 40:34.245
He received the Silver Star
for taking out those German guns.

40:34.419 --> 40:37.586
He took everything
the Krauts could throw.

40:38.632 --> 40:40.589
Lieutenant Compton?

40:42.135 --> 40:47.093
“UCLA did not make the Rose Bowl,
probably because you weren't there.

40:47.348 --> 40:52.508
”I'm sure you're teaching your young
soldiers the joy you have of the sport.

40:52.770 --> 40:58.523
How we all know what an exciting young
man you are, how your heart and love—”

41:01.945 --> 41:06.903
I guess he just couldn't take seeing
Toye and Guarnere all torn up.

41:07.159 --> 41:11.026
No one ever thought any
less of him for it.

41:20.672 --> 41:22.296
Hey, Bull.

41:23.174 --> 41:27.337
With Buck off the line,
there was no alternative to Dike.

41:27.511 --> 41:29.504
At least none we could see.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.174
Thanks.

41:33.225 --> 41:34.850
Hey, Muck.

41:36.020 --> 41:39.270
–Muck. I'm looking for Lt Dike.
–Yes, sergeant.

41:39.439 --> 41:43.817
We were stuck with Dike.
And he was off taking a walk.

41:48.657 --> 41:51.693
Lightning Six, Kidnap.

41:51.951 --> 41:54.489
We've cleared all the green area…

41:54.662 --> 41:56.987
We'd cleared the woods
east of Foy.

41:57.165 --> 42:01.992
Later, E Company and the rest of the 506
cleared the woods west of Foy.

42:02.169 --> 42:04.458
There was little resistance.

42:04.714 --> 42:08.414
–We have KIA.
–Thirteen.

42:08.592 --> 42:12.376
You fellas know I got no reason
to bullshit you, right?

42:12.638 --> 42:14.547
Look, this is what I saw.

42:14.723 --> 42:18.056
It was so unbelievable
you might not believe me.

42:18.226 --> 42:22.058
You-know-who runs up.
No helmet, no gear, nothing.

42:22.230 --> 42:28.600
“1st Sgt Lipton, you organize
things here, and I'm gonna go for help.”

42:28.820 --> 42:31.062
“I need to polish my oak leaves.”

42:31.239 --> 42:33.153
–Hey, Luz.
–Complete asshole.

42:33.324 --> 42:36.360
–That's really good.
–Fellas.

42:36.536 --> 42:39.453
–Good night, all.
–See you, Luz.

42:39.664 --> 42:41.039
Sarge?

42:41.207 --> 42:44.161
Two things.
First, great impression of Dike.

42:44.335 --> 42:47.585
–I thought it was off.
–You got it pretty good.

42:47.755 --> 42:52.879
Second, don't do it anymore, especially
the part about what he said to me.

42:53.051 --> 42:56.467
–It doesn't do anybody any good, okay?
–I got you.

42:56.638 --> 42:58.013
All right.

43:00.809 --> 43:02.801
Wiseass.

43:08.649 --> 43:10.559
Incoming!

43:28.293 --> 43:32.207
Luz! Luz! Come on! Luz! Hurry!

43:32.464 --> 43:35.963
Move! Luz!

43:36.176 --> 43:41.846
Stay down! Stay down! Come on!
Get in here! Luz, come on!

43:42.098 --> 43:44.767
Luz! Come on, Luz! Come on!

43:45.017 --> 43:47.425
Come on! Luz!

44:16.506 --> 44:20.206
–Muck and Penkala!
–What?

44:20.468 --> 44:23.338
Muck and Penkala got hit!

44:31.270 --> 44:33.013
Medic!

44:37.150 --> 44:39.820
–Hashey!
–Shit, it's my shoulder.

44:40.070 --> 44:43.521
Come on! Get up! Move!

44:47.160 --> 44:50.825
Stay down! Incoming!

45:12.517 --> 45:16.052
–I thought you didn't smoke.
–I don't.

45:27.448 --> 45:31.446
The shell that hit the foxhole
Luz and I were in was a dud.

45:31.619 --> 45:37.123
The one that hit Muck and Penkala's
foxhole wasn't. That's the way it was.

45:37.333 --> 45:40.250
Muck and Penkala were good men.

45:42.671 --> 45:44.711
Their death hit Malarkey hard.

45:44.923 --> 45:48.292
His best friends were
Compton, Muck and Penkala.

45:48.468 --> 45:52.133
In less than a week,
he'd seen two of them die.

45:53.515 --> 45:56.350
–The word?
–The men on the line are okay.

45:56.518 --> 45:58.309
Food has been resupplied.

45:58.561 --> 46:01.764
We'll hunker down.
We might get relief soon.

46:02.023 --> 46:04.229
Okay? All right.

46:24.920 --> 46:29.000
Later that day, we were in our
old position overlooking Foy.

46:29.174 --> 46:32.210
We were all worried about Malarkey.

46:32.469 --> 46:34.461
Hey, Malark?

46:38.599 --> 46:45.480
Didn't I hear you say you wanted to
bring a Luger home to your kid brother?

46:53.322 --> 46:58.067
Well, why don't you give him that?

47:01.955 --> 47:04.742
–It's Hoob's, right?
–Yeah.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.128
Yeah, I was gonna
get rid of it, but I…

47:09.379 --> 47:11.371
I don't know.

47:12.715 --> 47:18.054
Captain Winters was wondering if
you wanted to go back to Battalion…

47:18.304 --> 47:21.174
and work as his runner
for a few days.

47:24.351 --> 47:28.396
Tell him thanks.
I'm gonna stay here.

47:29.815 --> 47:34.441
Why don't you come back for an
hour or so, say goodbye to Buck?

47:34.611 --> 47:37.232
I'm sure it'll mean a lot to him.

47:42.327 --> 47:43.489
All right.

47:46.706 --> 47:48.864
You be careful with that.

47:50.209 --> 47:52.700
Getting 50 yards back for an hour…

47:52.879 --> 47:56.923
could make a big difference
in a soldier's state of mind.

48:00.219 --> 48:02.924
The morning after the shelling…

48:03.097 --> 48:07.225
I saw a soldier try to dig a
foxhole with his bare hands.

48:07.392 --> 48:11.141
He didn't notice that he had
torn off his fingernails.

48:11.313 --> 48:15.856
I got him out of there quickly.
Not for his sake, but for ours.

48:16.109 --> 48:21.898
Fear is poison in combat. Something
we all felt but didn't show. You can't.

48:22.156 --> 48:25.821
It's destructive, and it's contagious.

48:27.578 --> 48:29.950
Told you I'd get you started.

48:36.295 --> 48:40.127
Buck was never the same after
Toye and Guarnere got hit.

48:40.299 --> 48:43.833
I guess he just needed
some time away from it all.

48:56.022 --> 48:59.557
The January 3rd barrages and
January 9th shelling…

48:59.734 --> 49:03.103
marked the low point
for the men in E Company.

49:03.279 --> 49:05.686
Even then, very few actually broke.

49:05.865 --> 49:12.152
But I knew the terror and pressure
we'd been under could take their toll.

49:12.329 --> 49:16.623
I was afraid the men would lose focus,
suffer a drop in morale.

49:16.792 --> 49:20.291
And that was dangerous,
especially in combat.

49:20.462 --> 49:23.629
More of which lay in store for us.

49:25.050 --> 49:27.422
We'd cleared east and west of Foy.

49:27.594 --> 49:32.932
It was time for the inevitable assault
on Foy itself. I was dreading it.

49:33.099 --> 49:37.262
The men who trained at Toccoa
wouldn't get through unscathed.

49:37.437 --> 49:42.063
I was beginning to wonder if any
of us would make it through at all.

49:42.233 --> 49:46.526
We would lead the attacks.
The problem was, in my estimation…

49:46.695 --> 49:49.613
E Company still did not
have a leader.

50:00.792 --> 50:06.415
Before the attack, I did something
I'd never have imagined myself doing.

50:14.096 --> 50:15.804
Lip!

50:17.475 --> 50:21.555
–Didn't figure you for a smoking man.
–Neither did I.

50:25.357 --> 50:28.856
D Company, Lieutenant Speirs,
patrol order.

50:30.237 --> 50:31.612
So?

50:31.863 --> 50:34.734
We've been watching Foy,
not much activity.

50:34.991 --> 50:38.028
–Want a coffee?
–No, thank you, sir.

50:40.163 --> 50:43.911
–How's Easy's status?
–The men are good. Prepared.

50:44.083 --> 50:46.040
I lead 2nd Platoon tomorrow.

50:46.252 --> 50:51.839
They're the weakest after losing Toye
and Guarnere and Muck and Penkala.

50:52.091 --> 50:54.498
I have every confidence in the men.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.385
Good.

51:01.058 --> 51:05.138
But on the other hand,
I have no confidence in our CO.

51:06.063 --> 51:09.182
Lieutenant Dike is an
empty uniform, captain.

51:09.441 --> 51:13.901
He's just…
He's not there, sir.

51:15.238 --> 51:19.983
–He'll be there tomorrow.
–I understand he'll be there physically.

51:20.243 --> 51:24.786
Tomorrow will be the real deal.
He'll have to lead those men.

51:25.039 --> 51:28.574
He's gonna have
to make decisions, sir, and…

51:28.834 --> 51:33.295
I think he's gonna get a lot
of Easy Company men killed.

51:37.134 --> 51:41.001
–Thank you, sergeant. That'll be all.
–Yes, sir.

51:44.307 --> 51:49.218
I said what I had to say.
There was nothing Winters could do.

51:52.357 --> 51:56.022
Couldn't remove a
well-connected company CO…

51:56.194 --> 51:59.728
because of the misgivings
of a first sergeant.

51:59.906 --> 52:04.069
You got an eighth of a mile
to cross before you get into Foy.

52:04.243 --> 52:06.070
There's very little cover.

52:06.328 --> 52:09.780
Two sections of machine guns
will give you cover.

52:09.999 --> 52:13.996
3rd Battalion will come from the east
to cause distraction.

52:14.169 --> 52:16.162
D Company will be in reserve.

52:16.338 --> 52:19.374
The point is,
you gotta move in there fast.

52:19.633 --> 52:23.844
Before they can bring their
mortars and artillery down on you.

52:24.012 --> 52:25.839
–Clear?
–Clear.

52:26.097 --> 52:30.426
I'm relying on you. Get it done.

52:43.864 --> 52:47.529
–Covering fire!
–Let's go. Keep it moving.

52:49.620 --> 52:52.111
Suppressing fire!

52:54.499 --> 52:56.373
–Go, go, go!
–Keep moving!

53:03.049 --> 53:05.042
Let's go! Let's go!

53:07.387 --> 53:10.340
–Suppressing fire!
–Feuer!

53:11.849 --> 53:13.972
Keep them tight, Shames!

53:15.394 --> 53:17.636
–Keep moving!
–Keep moving!

53:19.607 --> 53:21.184
Krauts in the open!

53:23.902 --> 53:26.144
Keep moving! Keep moving!

53:26.405 --> 53:28.113
Three inside!

53:30.742 --> 53:32.699
Wait a minute. Where's Foley?

53:33.912 --> 53:36.367
–Randleman!
–Coming through! Run!

53:36.623 --> 53:38.366
Liebgott!

53:39.292 --> 53:41.331
Where the hell is 1st Platoon?

53:44.755 --> 53:47.673
–Hold up!
–Keep moving!

53:47.925 --> 53:50.001
Easy Company! Hold up!

53:50.177 --> 53:54.341
–2nd Platoon! Hold up! Hold up!
–Will you move?

53:54.598 --> 53:57.385
–Get me Foley on the radio.
–Move!

53:57.643 --> 54:03.017
–Sir, I think we should take cover.
–Find some cover! Find some cover!

54:03.273 --> 54:04.471
What?

54:06.651 --> 54:08.691
–Easy Red, Easy—
–Six, over.

54:08.945 --> 54:11.151
Six, Easy Red. Go ahead.

54:11.865 --> 54:14.402
Easy Red,
stand by for the Six.

54:14.617 --> 54:20.572
Foley, you get back here where
I can see you, goddamn it!

54:20.832 --> 54:24.746
1st Platoon, hold up! Hold up!
Take cover! Martin!

54:25.002 --> 54:27.042
–Come with me!
–With you, sir.

54:28.589 --> 54:29.964
Feuer!

54:31.675 --> 54:34.166
Fall back! Fall back!

54:35.220 --> 54:36.595
Take cover!

54:37.222 --> 54:40.223
–Goddamn it.
–Go forward!

54:41.685 --> 54:45.054
–Herron, on me.
–Move back.

54:45.230 --> 54:46.640
Stay on my ass.

54:46.898 --> 54:50.812
–Hold fast, 2nd Platoon!
–Follow Lipton! Take cover!

54:51.069 --> 54:53.939
What are we doing?
Why are we stopped?

54:54.197 --> 54:56.652
Fall back! Fall back!

54:56.908 --> 54:59.149
Roger, Kidnap. Stand by for Six.

54:59.410 --> 55:03.110
–Lieutenant, what's the plan?
–I don't know!

55:03.789 --> 55:05.782
Get Dike on that radio now!

55:06.000 --> 55:08.751
–What's the plan?
–Captain Winters, sir.

55:08.919 --> 55:12.999
–Give us a plan!
–Okay. Foley, take your men—

55:13.382 --> 55:18.921
Take your men around the village
and attack from the rear.

55:19.596 --> 55:21.423
We cannot stay here!

55:21.639 --> 55:24.261
Want 1st Platoon to attack by itself?

55:24.434 --> 55:28.431
–We'll provide suppressing fire.
–We'll be alone out there.

55:28.604 --> 55:32.269
We will provide suppressing fire!

55:38.656 --> 55:41.229
Get going forward!

55:41.492 --> 55:45.988
You need to talk
to Captain Winters, sir.

55:47.998 --> 55:50.240
Sir! Okay, here it is.

55:50.500 --> 55:54.083
We go on a flanking run
and attack from the rear.

55:54.337 --> 55:57.540
Take them.
Find cover behind this table.

55:57.799 --> 56:00.088
Go! Go!

56:00.301 --> 56:02.460
–Shit!
–Jesus Christ.

56:03.429 --> 56:06.264
Webb, move up! Find cover!

56:15.899 --> 56:17.442
Suppressing fire now!

56:19.736 --> 56:22.310
Perconte! I got you!

56:22.531 --> 56:25.022
Give me some cover.

56:26.576 --> 56:30.277
–How you doing, Perconte?
–They shot me in my ass!

56:31.956 --> 56:35.491
–Stay down.
–We lost five men. Can you locate?

56:35.752 --> 56:41.256
–The building with the caved-in roof!
–The building with the caved-in roof!

56:47.012 --> 56:52.386
Sir, we are sitting ducks here.
We have to keep moving!

56:52.643 --> 56:57.388
–You've got to keep moving!
–Dick! Captain Winters!

56:57.648 --> 57:03.187
You do not go out there! You're the
battalion commander. Get back here!

57:03.945 --> 57:09.236
–I understand your attachment to Easy—
–Speirs! Get yourself over here!

57:09.492 --> 57:12.695
Go relieve Dike
and take that attack on in.

57:16.249 --> 57:19.700
–Go, soldier!
–Webb, fall back. You're too exposed!

57:20.544 --> 57:25.087
–Fall back! Fall back!
–Come on, Webb! Let's go, kid!

57:27.051 --> 57:30.301
–Hang on, Perco.
–Feuer!

57:32.723 --> 57:36.886
–What are we doing?
–Let's go!

57:37.686 --> 57:40.852
–I'm taking over. 1st Sgt Lipton!
–Here!

57:41.022 --> 57:44.356
–What do we got?
–The company is spread out here.

57:44.526 --> 57:46.851
1st Platoon tried an end-around.

57:47.028 --> 57:49.982
They're pinned by a sniper
in that building.

57:50.156 --> 57:54.616
I want mortars and grenade launchers.
I want 1st to go straight in.

57:54.785 --> 57:57.870
–Everybody else, follow me.
–Thank God!

57:59.123 --> 58:01.827
–Move it!
–3rd Platoon, let's go! Go!

58:03.168 --> 58:06.003
You heard the word.
2nd Platoon on the CO!

58:06.255 --> 58:09.090
–Sergeant Alley!
–Got it, sarge!

58:12.719 --> 58:16.005
Okay, 1st Platoon!
Move out! Move out!

58:16.264 --> 58:20.178
–On your feet, 2nd Platoon!
–Move out!

58:20.435 --> 58:24.764
Get on your goddamn feet!
Move it! Come on!

58:27.692 --> 58:31.855
Come on, let's get the bastards!
Right flank!

58:32.113 --> 58:33.690
Feuer!

58:35.741 --> 58:38.742
–Come on, move out!
–Fire!

58:38.994 --> 58:41.450
–Feuer!
–Take cover!

58:41.705 --> 58:43.283
Feuer!

58:44.791 --> 58:48.290
–Go, go, go!
–Come on! Come on!

58:50.255 --> 58:51.879
Radio, get over here.

58:52.132 --> 58:55.216
–Take cover!
–Fire!

58:55.885 --> 58:57.048
Sir.

58:57.345 --> 58:58.376
Lipton.

58:59.764 --> 59:02.302
Streetfight, Item. Easy Six. Over.

59:02.475 --> 59:06.223
–What do you see, Lipton?
–Armor and a lot of infantry.

59:06.479 --> 59:09.812
I Company's supposed
to be on the other side.

59:09.982 --> 59:11.476
–Radio, anything?
–No.

59:11.650 --> 59:14.817
If we don't connect with I,
they'll slip away.

59:15.070 --> 59:18.356
–That's right. Wait here.
–Item! Item! Easy Six.

59:18.615 --> 59:20.407
What the hell?

59:31.961 --> 59:35.412
At first the Germans
didn't shoot at him.

59:35.715 --> 59:38.881
They couldn't believe
what they were seeing.

59:39.135 --> 59:41.542
That wasn't the astounding thing.

59:41.721 --> 59:47.924
The astounding thing was, he hooked
up with I Company and came back.

01:00:19.507 --> 01:00:24.252
We took over 100 German prisoners.
After that, it was mostly cleanup.

01:00:24.511 --> 01:00:29.007
Let's go, move it. Move it.
Take them down to the barn.

01:00:32.811 --> 01:00:34.435
Sit down!

01:00:37.857 --> 01:00:41.937
–Sniper!
–Take cover! Take cover!

01:00:45.573 --> 01:00:47.981
Come on! Come on!

01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:50.074
Where is he?

01:00:51.203 --> 01:00:54.240
Shit. I can't see him.

01:00:57.042 --> 01:00:59.498
Second floor,
building on the right.

01:00:59.753 --> 01:01:03.204
Don't miss, Shifty. Now!

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.358
Over here. I need help.
Can you guys come here and help me?

01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:32.694
Mellet, Herron, Sowosko and
Ken Webb were killed by a sniper.

01:01:32.868 --> 01:01:35.869
There would have been more
if not for Shifty.

01:01:36.038 --> 01:01:40.166
Work your party, walk your
wounded to the aid station.

01:01:40.417 --> 01:01:43.667
Let's not just lollygag.
Keep this moving.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.048
–Get these boys to the aid station.
–Okay, sergeant.

01:01:59.602 --> 01:02:03.101
–You hit bad, Perconte?
–Beautiful wound, Lip.

01:02:03.355 --> 01:02:05.478
Shot me right through my ass.

01:02:05.733 --> 01:02:07.061
–Hey, sarge?
–Yeah.

01:02:07.318 --> 01:02:09.987
–Is it true about Dike?
–Yeah.

01:02:10.237 --> 01:02:14.946
–Thank God for small mercies!
–Yeah.

01:02:27.128 --> 01:02:32.964
We'd been looking at Foy for a month
knowing that's where we had to go.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:36.420
It was a great relief to have done it.

01:02:37.513 --> 01:02:40.051
The men thought once
we'd taken Foy…

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:44.138
they'd get us off the line,
ship us back to Mourmelon.

01:02:44.395 --> 01:02:46.055
But that wasn't to be.

01:02:46.313 --> 01:02:50.809
Two days later, we took Noville
and after that, Rachamps.

01:03:11.837 --> 01:03:14.874
We spent our night
in Rachamps in a convent.

01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:19.129
It was the first time we'd spent
a night indoors in a month.

01:03:30.939 --> 01:03:36.277
The sisters brought in their choir
to sing for us. It was heaven.

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:45.157
The mood of the men was relaxed.

01:03:45.328 --> 01:03:49.539
We were finally being relieved
and would soon be in Mourmelon.

01:03:49.707 --> 01:03:53.076
In the morning, we found out
Mourmelon would wait.

01:03:53.252 --> 01:03:55.756
Hitler had launched a counteroffensive.

01:03:55.796 --> 01:03:58.713
We were bound for Hagenau
to hold the line.

01:03:58.882 --> 01:04:05.051
But for that night, we didn't know it yet.
That night, we were okay.

01:04:22.989 --> 01:04:27.401
I tried to make a roster for
the company to see who we had left.

01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:32.404
We'd come into Belgium with 121 men
and officers plus 24 replacements.

01:04:32.664 --> 01:04:38.418
That's 145 total.
We were going out with 63.

01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:43.666
Guarnere was badly wounded,
and Hoobler died accidentally.

01:04:46.761 --> 01:04:49.466
Joe Toye had lost his leg.

01:04:55.353 --> 01:04:59.481
Among the dead were Herron,
Mellet, Sowosko, Kenneth Webb…

01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:04.268
Harold Webb, Alex Penkala
and Skip Muck.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:11.110
A month in Belgium cost us
one good officer, Buck Compton…

01:05:11.285 --> 01:05:14.903
and one bad one, Norman Dike.

01:05:18.416 --> 01:05:24.122
But we gained a good one in the end,
so I guess we came out ahead.

01:05:33.806 --> 01:05:37.506
–What is it?
–Nothing.

01:05:39.186 --> 01:05:43.480
I better get back to Battalion
before they disappear.

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:53.489
–You wanna ask me, don't you?
–Ask you what?

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:57.241
You wanna know if they're true,
the stories about me.

01:05:57.537 --> 01:06:02.199
With stories like that, everyone
heard it from someone who was there.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:07.535
When you ask that person, they say they
heard it from someone who was there.

01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:09.255
It's nothing new.

01:06:09.423 --> 01:06:13.255
If you went back 2000 years,
you'd hear centurions…

01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:18.718
yakking about how Tertius lopped off
the heads of Carthaginian prisoners.

01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:25.344
Maybe they kept talking about it because
they never heard Tertius deny it.

01:06:25.522 --> 01:06:29.733
Maybe Tertius knew
there was value to men thinking…

01:06:29.901 --> 01:06:34.230
he was the toughest son of
a bitch in the whole Roman Legion.

01:06:35.073 --> 01:06:37.065
Sir?

01:06:38.451 --> 01:06:41.654
These men aren't
concerned about the stories.

01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:44.746
They're just glad to have you
as our CO.

01:06:44.915 --> 01:06:47.786
They're happy to have
a good leader again.

01:06:48.043 --> 01:06:50.499
I've heard they've always had one.

01:06:50.671 --> 01:06:54.419
I'm told there's been
one man they could count on.

01:06:54.633 --> 01:06:59.461
Led them into Bois Jacques, held
them together as they were shelled.

01:06:59.638 --> 01:07:04.430
Kept their spirits up, kept the men
focused, gave them direction.

01:07:04.601 --> 01:07:08.349
All the things
a good combat leader does.

01:07:12.817 --> 01:07:15.818
Do you have any idea
who I'm talking about?

01:07:15.987 --> 01:07:20.031
–No, sir.
–Hell, it was you, first sergeant.

01:07:20.199 --> 01:07:25.406
Ever since Winters made Battalion,
you've been the leader of Easy Company.

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:36.167
Oh, and you're not gonna be first
sergeant much longer, first sergeant.

01:07:36.339 --> 01:07:37.917
Sir?

01:07:38.383 --> 01:07:42.677
Winters put in for a battlefield
commission. Sink approved.

01:07:42.846 --> 01:07:46.546
You should get the official nod
in a few days.

01:07:48.559 --> 01:07:52.059
Congratulations, lieutenant.

01:08:13.917 --> 01:08:16.288
Hey, look, it's 1st Battalion.

01:08:16.502 --> 01:08:18.957
–Hey! Hey!
–What do you want?

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:21.621
Thanks for crapping in our foxholes.

01:08:22.133 --> 01:08:24.706
–Hey, it's our pleasure.
–Yeah.

01:08:24.886 --> 01:08:27.756
Enjoy the walk, boys.

01:08:39.608 --> 01:08:44.151
There they go, Easy Company,
riding out again.
