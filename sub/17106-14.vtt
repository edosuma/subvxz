WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:03.799
-Previously on "Dance
Academy."

00:03.839 --> 00:04.759
TARA (OFFSCREEN):
That's enough.

00:04.799 --> 00:05.440
-Oh, I thought you
were flexible.

00:05.480 --> 00:06.080
You want to go higher.

00:06.120 --> 00:07.040
--No, no, no, stop.

00:07.080 --> 00:07.879
-Saskia.

00:07.919 --> 00:10.800
-Are you teaching this class?

00:10.839 --> 00:11.759
[pop]

00:11.800 --> 00:13.119
[grunt of pain]

00:13.160 --> 00:15.039
-You're letting me back
into the academy?

00:15.080 --> 00:16.839
-This time on your own merit.

00:16.879 --> 00:18.559
-[squealing]

00:18.600 --> 00:19.559
-Oh!

00:19.600 --> 00:21.160
That, that's really
not necessary.

00:21.199 --> 00:22.559
DOCTOR (OFFSCREEN): You've
danced on this.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.399
If you keep going, there's a
good chance that you could

00:24.440 --> 00:25.399
break the other side.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.039
And that's going to
require surgery.

00:27.079 --> 00:28.399
CHRISTIAN (THROUGH
WALKIE-TALKIE): When I kissed

00:28.440 --> 00:30.160
you, that's something I wanted
to do for a long time.

00:30.199 --> 00:31.800
-I swear I told him nothing
was ever going to happen

00:31.839 --> 00:32.799
between us.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.679
-But you want it to?

00:34.719 --> 00:36.759
-You were aware you were
breaking the rules when you

00:36.799 --> 00:39.479
went to an outside doctor,
and you did it anyway.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.200
I have no choice but to expel
you from the academy.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.520
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.480
Close your eyes.

01:04.519 --> 01:09.040
Take a leap of faith, and
lead the way to life.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.439
This is my chance.

01:14.480 --> 01:18.400
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:29.239 --> 01:30.799
[music playing]

02:00.560 --> 02:06.040
[phone vibrating]

02:09.840 --> 02:12.080
-T, I didn't know if this
was insensitive.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.800
But I thought you might like to
know you made it through to

02:13.840 --> 02:16.639
the nationals.

02:16.680 --> 02:17.800
-OK, hold on, Kat.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.199
I'll just put her on.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.719
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

02:25.759 --> 02:27.560
She's sleeping right now.

02:27.599 --> 02:29.319
Can I have her call you back?

02:29.360 --> 02:31.719
-OK, thanks Mrs. Webster.

02:31.759 --> 02:33.120
Bye.

02:37.840 --> 02:38.560
TARA (PHONE RECORDING):
Hi, it's Tara.

02:38.599 --> 02:39.319
Sorry I missed you.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.439
Leave a message.

02:40.479 --> 02:41.960
[beep]

02:42.000 --> 02:43.599
-Look, I know that we haven't
been all that close this year.

02:43.639 --> 02:47.080
But I am here for you
if you need me.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.639
Um, Abigail would
like to say hi.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.599
-Hi.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.639
I hope your back's
feeling better.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.599
I placed higher than you
in the preliminaries.

02:55.639 --> 02:56.800
Bye.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.759
TARA NARRATING: Sometimes
there's nothing left to say.

03:09.879 --> 03:11.560
All you want is to
be left alone.

03:15.159 --> 03:18.120
And the only person you want
to hear from is silent.

03:30.199 --> 03:31.599
TARA'S DAD (OFFSCREEN):
It's been six weeks.

03:31.639 --> 03:34.840
Our daughter is not going to
hide in that bed any longer.

03:34.879 --> 03:35.719
Up.

03:35.759 --> 03:36.840
You're getting dressed.

03:36.879 --> 03:38.159
And then I'm driving
you to school.

03:38.199 --> 03:38.520
TARA (OFFSCREEN): But--

03:38.560 --> 03:39.680
-Now.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.199
All right, compromise.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.319
No school today.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.479
But tomorrow we go to
that appointment.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.199
We find out what the
doctor has to say.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.560
-It doesn't matter if
it's healed or not.

03:53.599 --> 03:55.319
I'm out of the academy.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.800
TARA'S DAD (OFFSCREEN): Having
a healthy back is something

03:56.840 --> 03:59.039
that affects the rest
of your life.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.240
It matters.

04:03.439 --> 04:13.400
[clearing throat]

04:13.439 --> 04:19.480
[clearing throat]

04:19.519 --> 04:22.199
I have to check the fence
line up on the ridge.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.600
You can meet me up there,
or you can walk home.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.759
-But I can't walk that far.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.480
I'm injured!

04:27.519 --> 04:28.680
Dad!

04:32.800 --> 04:36.399
[music playing]

04:36.439 --> 04:37.600
-Hi, Lulu.

04:39.839 --> 04:42.519
Hello?

04:42.560 --> 04:44.360
I have been the new kid twice
too often this year.

04:44.399 --> 04:47.560
So if there's a problem, can
we just sort it out now?

04:47.600 --> 04:50.319
-Our problem is with
your kind.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.040
-You're a second year in
a first year's leotard.

04:52.079 --> 04:54.319
And we don't like the
second years.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.839
-You don't think that's
just a touch yearist?

04:56.879 --> 04:59.160
-We wanted to compete in
the Prix de Fonteyn.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.160
-We deserved to compete.

05:01.199 --> 05:02.680
-But the second years suck
up all the attention.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.759
-Which is infuriating.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.639
Became, with the exception
of Abigail--

05:05.680 --> 05:07.360
STUDENTS (OFFSCREEN): (IN
UNISON) We love Abigail.

05:07.399 --> 05:09.560
-She' so dedicated.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.040
You're more obsessed with
relationships than ballet.

05:12.079 --> 05:12.800
-Huh.

05:12.839 --> 05:14.759
Right.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.160
Carry on then.

05:27.319 --> 05:29.439
-Feel better?

05:29.480 --> 05:32.199
-Not really.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.680
-The doctor said it was good
for you to move around.

05:43.839 --> 05:45.720
Remember when you were little.

05:45.759 --> 05:48.480
You'd wait up here for
hours so you could

05:48.519 --> 05:49.680
see the first star?

05:52.160 --> 05:53.800
You always wanted to
make that wish.

05:53.839 --> 05:56.639
-[crying]

05:56.680 --> 05:58.040
-Oh, princess.

05:58.079 --> 06:01.360
-[sobbing]

06:01.399 --> 06:02.680
Sorry.

06:02.720 --> 06:07.279
I just, I just don't know what
to wish for anymore.

06:07.319 --> 06:15.600
[sobbing]

06:15.639 --> 06:17.839
-Do you know there's a whole
creepy dictatorship going on

06:17.879 --> 06:19.839
that we're not even aware of?

06:19.879 --> 06:21.680
-Oh, I gotta go.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.519
-Why has he got that
look on his face?

06:23.560 --> 06:24.680
-I don't have a look.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.319
-No, it's your running
to the toilet face.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.439
-No, it's not.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.120
-Oh, has he been eating
green curry again?

06:28.160 --> 06:30.079
-It's not my curry face.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.040
OK, it's--

06:32.079 --> 06:34.360
for weeks now you guys have been
using me as an excuse to

06:34.399 --> 06:36.399
hang out guilt free.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.680
-You think we don't
feel guilty.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.319
-Look, I'm not judging.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.360
Well, actually, I am judging.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.800
If you guys want to get
together, fine.

06:41.839 --> 06:42.920
Be together.

06:42.959 --> 06:44.240
I just don't want to be
around to see it.

06:48.879 --> 06:50.639
-It is curious that you're
still denying

06:50.680 --> 06:53.360
that there's chemistry.

06:53.399 --> 06:55.480
-With my last dying breath.

06:55.519 --> 06:58.160
-Yet you can't stay
away from me.

06:58.199 --> 06:59.360
-Family

06:59.399 --> 07:01.759
-You have a genetic obligation
to talk to me.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.319
-Oh, well, can we do that
while I'm writing job

07:03.360 --> 07:04.800
applications?

07:04.839 --> 07:06.720
The company decided today that
it's time I spread my wings.

07:06.759 --> 07:07.600
-Yowch.

07:07.639 --> 07:09.399
Uh, not to be selfish.

07:09.439 --> 07:12.639
But will you be seeking
local work?

07:12.680 --> 07:15.439
-Impression said they would
look at my new show reel.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.600
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Spain.

07:16.639 --> 07:17.360
-I know.

07:17.399 --> 07:17.839
Bad timing.

07:17.879 --> 07:19.240
But, uh--

07:24.439 --> 07:25.639
STUDENTS (OFFSCREEN): (IN
UNISON) Hi, Abigail.

07:31.839 --> 07:34.399
-Hey, how do you get your
hair like that?

07:34.439 --> 07:35.839
I mean, I spray and spray.

07:35.879 --> 07:37.639
And still, flyaways.

07:51.199 --> 07:53.160
TARA'S DAD (OFFSCREEN):
How was it?

07:53.199 --> 07:55.439
-We have to wait for
the specialist.

07:55.480 --> 07:59.360
-Well, he can't see
us until 5:00.

07:59.399 --> 08:01.519
Do you want to come with me, and
sweet talk the bank about

08:01.560 --> 08:02.800
canola prices?

08:02.839 --> 08:04.720
-I'd just prefer to stay here.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.560
I'm approaching now.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.160
And yes, I have the
rocket booster.

08:15.199 --> 08:18.680
You have to stop
micromanaging.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.079
Oh!

08:27.240 --> 08:30.199
Hey, Tara.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.519
What are you doing here?

08:31.560 --> 08:32.440
-Back stuff.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.840
-So it's actually broken?

08:33.879 --> 08:35.120
That's what Grace
has been saying.

08:35.159 --> 08:38.039
But there are so many rumors.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.240
-What are you doing here?

08:42.159 --> 08:43.399
-Does anyone know you're
in Sydney.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.080
-I haven't been feeling very
socially connected.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.120
-I'm diagnosing that you could
do with a destruction.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.240
Believe me, it's
going to help.

08:56.559 --> 08:59.039
Every few months, the ward
like put on a show.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.480
-I didn't know you
volunteered.

09:00.519 --> 09:02.279
-I'm quite saintly.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.519
Anyway, this time, the director
is launching "The

09:04.559 --> 09:07.320
Space Rescue Mission
Spectacular."

09:07.360 --> 09:10.600
-Laika was the first living
creature to orbit earth.

09:10.639 --> 09:14.080
Do you honestly believe that
is a fitting tribute?

09:17.600 --> 09:21.240
-A rocket for milady.

09:21.279 --> 09:23.200
-Talk to me about
the tap pups.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.080
-Still walking them down.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.480
Slight scheduling conflict.

09:26.519 --> 09:29.240
-Benjamin, they're the
shooting star.

09:29.279 --> 09:30.799
I've done you one better.

09:30.840 --> 09:34.200
Maddie, meet Tara, star of the
National Academy of Dance.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.559
-Um, former student.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.840
-Can she do a no-handed
cartwheel?

09:36.879 --> 09:38.639
TARA (OFFSCREEN): I don't
dance anymore.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.399
I'm injured.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.399
-I have leukemia.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.159
Want to know who wins?

09:41.200 --> 09:42.399
BEN (OFFSCREEN): Maddie.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.799
Tara can help you with your
solo, make it more

09:44.840 --> 09:45.759
professional.

09:45.799 --> 09:46.840
-Oh, no.

09:46.879 --> 09:47.440
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.120
-Fine.

09:48.159 --> 09:48.720
-I'm really not ready--

09:48.759 --> 09:50.039
-Cripple can stay.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.639
You get on glitter gun.

09:51.679 --> 09:52.639
Denzel doesn't know
Jupiter from--

09:52.679 --> 09:54.480
-Uranus?

09:54.519 --> 09:55.440
-You're making that joke?

09:55.480 --> 09:56.039
-What?

09:56.080 --> 09:57.240
-Seriously?

10:03.519 --> 10:08.360
[phone vibrating]

10:11.200 --> 10:12.080
Sorry I missed you.

10:12.120 --> 10:12.759
Leave a message.

10:12.799 --> 10:14.360
[beep]

10:21.440 --> 10:23.559
-Top of the morning to you.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.320
-Class doesn't start
for an hour.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.759
-Oh, endorphin overload.

10:26.799 --> 10:29.200
I've been in the Pilates
studio since 6:00.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.519
-Huh.

10:30.559 --> 10:33.240
-Did you guys know the American
Ballet Theater is in

10:33.279 --> 10:34.200
town?

10:34.240 --> 10:36.440
-We already booked,
months ago.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.480
-Oh.

10:37.519 --> 10:38.720
Drat.

10:41.279 --> 10:44.600
These are preview VIP.

10:44.639 --> 10:46.000
Shame.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.320
Lily, I couldn't interest
you at all, could I?

10:56.120 --> 10:57.799
Orchestra pit seating,
exclusive entry

10:57.840 --> 10:59.200
to the after party.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.759
Family connections.

11:11.039 --> 11:12.559
-I've opened the air lock.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.720
And I'm space walking towards
the asteroid.

11:14.759 --> 11:16.679
-That's good.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.759
-Don't patronize me.

11:19.799 --> 11:21.279
You're lost in space.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.799
Give it some emotion.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.120
KID (OFFSCREEN): [howling]

11:25.159 --> 11:26.320
-That will definitely help.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.159
But, um, you're in space.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.159
So that means weightlessness,
right?

11:31.200 --> 11:35.080
So maybe you should try and make
everything kind of slow

11:35.120 --> 11:36.600
and, and fluid.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.200
-Don't hurt yourself.

11:47.639 --> 11:49.759
-Ooh, it would be perfect
if you had wires.

11:49.799 --> 11:51.120
I've done it before.

11:51.159 --> 11:53.360
It's literally like you're
swimming through the air.

11:53.399 --> 11:54.480
-Wires?

11:54.519 --> 11:56.360
I don't think of that.

11:56.399 --> 11:58.600
Hey, Benjamin.

11:58.639 --> 12:02.159
-I'm on it.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.279
-I know it's name dropping
a little bit.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.759
But Mikhail once brought a
donkey to my 10th birthday

12:07.799 --> 12:09.600
party, which was hysterical--

12:09.639 --> 12:10.639
-We're losing them.

12:10.679 --> 12:11.840
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Living
in a penthouse.

12:11.879 --> 12:13.759
-Sorry, you mean Baryshnikov,
the most famous

12:13.799 --> 12:16.440
dancer on the planet?

12:16.480 --> 12:17.080
INSTRUCTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Why are you all

12:17.120 --> 12:18.759
just sitting there?

12:18.799 --> 12:20.240
Your influence, Katrina?

12:22.720 --> 12:24.080
MADDIE (OFFSCREEN): Everyone
else go get your

12:24.120 --> 12:25.240
planet, and put it on.

12:25.279 --> 12:27.360
And then shout out your name.

12:27.399 --> 12:29.080
-Uh, Pluto.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.279
-Uranus.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.039
-Saturn.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.120
-Jupiter.

12:32.159 --> 12:34.440
-It's to support
an 11-year-old.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.080
But she has a really
heavy ego.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.360
No, can I not go on hold?

12:42.159 --> 12:46.279
-So Maddie, how sick is she?

12:46.320 --> 12:47.600
-I think she's having
a good day.

12:47.639 --> 12:48.279
MADDIE (OFFSCREEN): Know your
place, Pluto you're

12:48.320 --> 12:49.799
hanging by a thread.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.120
-But the doctors, do they know
if she's going to get better,

12:52.159 --> 12:53.519
or--

12:53.559 --> 12:54.759
-Maddie's been in and out of
chemo since she was four.

12:54.799 --> 12:56.039
MADDIE (OFFSCREEN):
Hurry up, Venus.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.120
-You stop asking that question,
and just focus on

12:58.159 --> 12:59.399
what you can control.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.559
MADDIE (OFFSCREEN): OK, that's
pretty good, guys.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.799
Now I want you to spin
as you're doing it.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.120
It's a bit more complicated.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.279
But you can do it.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.679
-So why didn't you fight
getting expelled?

13:13.360 --> 13:14.200
-I broke the rules.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.080
I, I went to an outside
doctor.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.759
-Yeah, but that day in training
with Saskia, when she

13:18.799 --> 13:22.320
pushed you, was that how
you got injured?

13:22.360 --> 13:23.559
-I was being arrogant.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.559
I told her she could
go higher.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.679
-Yeah, but when we told her
to stop, she didn't.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.360
MADDIE (OFFSCREEN): Well done.

13:28.399 --> 13:30.720
OK, now one more time.

13:30.759 --> 13:31.720
-You do?

13:31.759 --> 13:32.840
MADDIE (OFFSCREEN):
Listen, guys.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.080
We can't move on until
we get this right.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.440
-That much?

13:35.480 --> 13:37.320
Did I mention it's
for charity?

13:37.360 --> 13:40.679
MADDIE (OFFSCREEN): That's
much better.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.240
-Oh, wow.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.279
Did you body snatch Abigail.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.679
-I'm thinking about it.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.279
-Ah, hey, if you do see her,
can you tell her that I'm

13:47.320 --> 13:48.480
looking for her.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.159
-Going out with all
your friends?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.440
-Uh huh.

13:54.480 --> 13:58.279
-So why did I get invited
to join this group?

13:58.320 --> 14:02.559
Stop Kat Karamakov from
poisoning first year.

14:02.600 --> 14:06.159
Look, 19 members already.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.799
-You all know her dance past.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.559
But this fun-loving rebel
pitches herself as the best

14:11.600 --> 14:13.159
friend that you'll ever have.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.159
LULU (OFFSCREEN): And that
is what she will

14:14.200 --> 14:17.759
use to suck you in.

14:17.799 --> 14:20.440
-This is insane.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.440
You realize they're just
trying to control you.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.600
-Now let's take a look at what
happened to BFF casualty

14:24.639 --> 14:26.600
number one--

14:26.639 --> 14:28.320
Abigail Armstrong.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.799
Oral history reports that when
Abigail decied to focus on

14:30.840 --> 14:35.759
ballet, Kat dumped her
for being boring.

14:35.799 --> 14:38.360
-It was more complicated
than that.

14:38.399 --> 14:39.440
And we were 11.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.600
-Oh, but you weren't
when you betrayed

14:40.639 --> 14:42.360
your most recent victim--

14:42.399 --> 14:43.679
Tara Webster.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.480
This so-called friend had a
secret relationship with

14:46.519 --> 14:49.559
Tara's boyfriend, causing a
talented dancer to suffer a

14:49.600 --> 14:52.120
nervous breakdown, which
led to her being

14:52.159 --> 14:53.759
expelled from the academy.

14:53.799 --> 14:56.799
Now do we really want this
negative influence to

14:56.840 --> 14:59.759
destabilize our year?

14:59.799 --> 15:01.159
Lily?

15:12.039 --> 15:12.960
-I have to get back.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.440
Can you wish Maddie
luck for me?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.399
-You're not staying?

15:16.440 --> 15:18.320
Curtain's up in T-minus
one hour.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.720
-I have my appointment.

15:19.759 --> 15:22.159
-I thought that was later.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.799
-Look, I know what I'm going
through is nothing in

15:23.840 --> 15:25.080
comparison to this.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.519
But I just don't want to watch
dancing right now.

15:27.559 --> 15:30.159
I mean, imagine if you could
never do it again.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.519
-You could.

15:31.559 --> 15:33.720
If they say your back is better,
then you can going to

15:33.759 --> 15:36.679
Ms. Raine, and ask for
your place back.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.279
Why not?

15:38.320 --> 15:41.360
Because of Kat and Christian?

15:41.399 --> 15:43.440
-Look, I don't want to hope that
I'm OK, and then find out

15:43.480 --> 15:44.759
that I'm not.

15:44.799 --> 15:46.120
You know, it probably sounds
really dramatic to you.

15:46.159 --> 15:48.759
But everything that I've counted
on has either been not

15:48.799 --> 15:52.360
what I thought it was, or
taken away from me.

15:52.399 --> 15:57.120
How are you supposed to
come back from that?

15:57.159 --> 15:58.799
-You just have to.

15:58.840 --> 16:02.759
Because if you waste too much
time blaming the world, the

16:02.799 --> 16:04.120
world wins.

16:19.159 --> 16:21.519

16:24.120 --> 16:25.080
What?

16:25.120 --> 16:25.840
What do you want to
say to me, Kat?

16:25.879 --> 16:29.519
Just please don't hang up.

16:29.559 --> 16:31.600
I think--

16:31.639 --> 16:35.639
I think I need an estimate
of how long you're

16:35.679 --> 16:37.600
going to hate me.

16:37.639 --> 16:40.559
Because if there's a goal,
then maybe I can

16:40.600 --> 16:41.759
work towards that.

16:44.720 --> 16:48.240
-I don't know.

16:48.279 --> 16:50.440
-Tara, I am so unbelievably--

16:50.480 --> 16:51.639
-I know.

16:54.519 --> 16:55.679
-Sorry.

[music playing]

17:28.640 --> 17:31.160

prove that you can resist me.

-[scoffing]

17:32.519 --> 17:35.079
I've been busy workshopping
some contemporary solos,

17:35.119 --> 17:36.359
seeing as you're not
going to be here to

17:36.400 --> 17:37.680
choreograph for the nationals.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.200
-So are you saying you're going
to miss me, Abigail?

17:40.240 --> 17:41.200
-No.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.200
[music playing]

17:58.200 --> 18:00.240
-I have it unsweetened, if
you're trying to be authentic.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.759
-I don't deserve
sugar, anyway.

18:05.799 --> 18:10.519
I am a horrible poisonous
person.

18:10.559 --> 18:15.559
-OK, enough with the
self loathing.

18:15.599 --> 18:17.640
I don't need people.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.119
You obviously do.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.000
Come on.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.799
-Abigail.

18:39.839 --> 18:42.000
We were just giving ourselves
an extra class.

18:42.039 --> 18:43.119
Would you like to sing?

18:43.160 --> 18:44.319
-I'm not staying.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.759
-It's come to my attention that
you've been portraying me

18:53.799 --> 18:56.599
as a victim.

18:56.640 --> 19:00.119
As your leader, I find that
extremely condescending.

19:00.160 --> 19:03.440
This girl may not look like your
typical academy student,

19:03.480 --> 19:05.799
but she's earned
her place here.

19:05.839 --> 19:07.559
-This isn't--

19:07.599 --> 19:08.759
we're going.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.640
-You cough in her direction,
and you'll

19:10.680 --> 19:12.200
have me to deal with.

19:16.319 --> 19:18.359
-So you train me to get
back into the academy.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.480
And now you've morphed
into my human shield.

19:21.519 --> 19:23.279
We're not becoming
friends, are we?

19:23.319 --> 19:24.559
-I really hope not.

19:29.519 --> 19:40.759
[clock ticking]

19:47.680 --> 19:51.559

like an astronaut.

19:51.599 --> 19:55.519
-My friends Sasha and Scarlet
are coming to watch.

19:55.559 --> 19:57.319
They haven't seen me since
I got sick again.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.799
-So, um, my space history
is terrible.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.680
Was Laika the first animal
to go up there?

20:09.720 --> 20:10.319
Wow.

20:10.359 --> 20:11.440
That was brave.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.480
-In real life, Laika died.

20:13.519 --> 20:14.680
This time we're bringing
her back.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.279
-Ah, the star.

20:18.319 --> 20:20.279
You ordered tap pups.

20:20.319 --> 20:21.359
So where do you want them?

20:21.400 --> 20:22.559
-I'll take them over.

20:30.559 --> 20:32.240
If you borrow my stuff,
you'll be evicted.

20:38.759 --> 20:43.119
MADDIE (OFFSCREEN): In 1957,
Laika, a stray dog, was

Seven hours later, she

TARA NARRATING: I was angry.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.400
So I ran away from home to
teach them a lesson.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.960
I stayed on top of the
hill for hours.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.759
But no one came to find me.

22:34.799 --> 22:36.599
I was so sure I was
in the right.

22:36.640 --> 22:40.519
But I'd never felt more lonely,
like the world was

22:40.559 --> 22:43.720
going on without me.

22:43.759 --> 22:46.640
Eventually, I swallowed my
pride, climbed back down, and

-Yeah.

23:41.519 --> 23:42.440
I'm going now.

something first?
