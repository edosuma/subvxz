WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:02.361
Wait minute. I want to confirm
this before we can report it.

00:02.400 --> 00:05.597
Okay, WBBM can now project
that Peter Florrick

00:05.630 --> 00:09.066
is the next State's Attorney
of Cook County.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.532
(applause and cheering)

00:12.640 --> 00:15.131
ANDREW:
It's always best
to know the truth,

00:15.180 --> 00:16.306
no matter
how much it hurts.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.442
Do you believe that?

00:17.480 --> 00:19.311
Yes.

00:19.350 --> 00:20.715
It was a rumor your husband

00:20.750 --> 00:22.741
slept with one of his coworkers
two years ago.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.384
There was no one
in the department
with that name.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.752
(gasps)

00:27.790 --> 00:31.248
Leela.

00:32.730 --> 00:34.698
But she doesn't exit.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.197
Unless you've
heard of her.

00:36.230 --> 00:37.322
Have you heard of her?

00:37.370 --> 00:39.361
Leela?
LANDAU:
Let me introduce you
to Cook County's

00:39.400 --> 00:41.265
new State's Attorney,
Peter Florrick!

00:41.300 --> 00:43.302
(applause and cheering)

00:46.840 --> 00:49.400
* For he's jolly good fellow

00:49.450 --> 00:52.817
* For he's
a jolly good fellow *

00:52.850 --> 00:56.149
* Which nobody can deny

00:56.190 --> 00:58.681
(singing fades)
* Which nobody can deny...

01:46.340 --> 01:47.591
(door opening)

01:50.510 --> 01:51.636
ALICIA:
Thanks for coming out so late.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.672
MAN:
No problem.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.217
Don't worry.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.253
Real estate
is a 24-hour a day job.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.893
Congratulations,
Mrs. State's Attorney.

02:14.930 --> 02:16.727
Thank you.

02:18.900 --> 02:21.198
So this is available now?

02:21.240 --> 02:22.901
It is. Two bedrooms,
two bath.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.363
Furnished.
$2,800 a month.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.571
But to be honest, if
you gave me some time

02:27.610 --> 02:28.907
I could probably get that down.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.601
No.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.777
That's fine. Thank you.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.742
It has a view.

02:35.780 --> 02:36.849
Most importantly,

02:36.890 --> 02:39.552
it's right around the
corner from the courthouse.

02:39.590 --> 02:40.818
Do you have the lease?

02:40.860 --> 02:44.352
Wow. When you decide,
you really decide.

02:44.390 --> 02:46.756
_ PETER: _
Ten minutes ago, I received

02:46.800 --> 02:49.394
a very gracious concession call
from Wendy Scott-Carr.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.727
(applause and cheering)

02:50.770 --> 02:52.863
That_ was Pe_ter Florrick
speaking to his supporters

02:52.900 --> 02:54.436
a few minutes ago.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.904
And now I've got his mother,
Mrs. Jackie Florrick.

02:56.940 --> 02:59.602
Well, you must be
a very proud mother tonight.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.198
Oh, Rob, you can't...
(mutes TV)

03:06.820 --> 03:08.879
(phone line ringing)

03:08.920 --> 03:11.912
(ringing continues)

03:11.950 --> 03:14.350
PETER:
Hey, babe, where are you?

03:14.390 --> 03:16.529
I found a place.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.527
What?!

03:17.560 --> 03:20.495
Like a house?
An apartment.

03:20.530 --> 03:21.656
Come look.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.498
(laughing):
What...? You there now?

03:24.530 --> 03:27.693
Yes. The kids are staying
with Jackie tonight.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.298
Okay. Well, look,

03:29.340 --> 03:30.967
can you give me about an hour?

03:31.010 --> 03:32.375
Things are starting
to wind down here.

03:32.410 --> 03:33.775
Sure.

03:33.810 --> 03:37.268
1601 North State,
Apartment 908.

03:37.310 --> 03:39.369
Okay, see you there.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.497
(doorbell rings)

04:22.390 --> 04:25.382
You are so funny.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.891
You got it already?

04:29.930 --> 04:31.067
(door closes)

04:31.100 --> 04:32.761
Is it big enough?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.038
This is your apartment, Peter.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.773
I've moved all your things here.

04:42.810 --> 04:44.471
What?
You'll have to use
your cell phone

04:44.510 --> 04:46.614
for a while until they
can get the phones connected,

04:46.650 --> 04:48.618
and I've paid
your first three months rent.

04:53.020 --> 04:55.488
I don't get this.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.987
You slept with Kalinda.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.658
Look”.
No,dontu.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.691
Peter.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.833
This makes
It eaSIer.

05:08.870 --> 05:11.009
So please just take your keys.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.007
Alicia, I need you.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.372
You slept with my best friend.

05:14.410 --> 05:16.344
It was before she was
your best friend.

05:16.380 --> 05:19.349
Oh, God.
Look, I'm not trying
to make excuses,

05:19.380 --> 05:21.075
but you know
I've changed.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.088
I love you.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.384
Look,

05:25.420 --> 05:26.978
what can I do to
make this better.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.817
(softly):
Nothing.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.851
(keys jingle)

05:32.130 --> 05:33.654
(door closes)

05:48.610 --> 05:50.749
(sobbing)

06:16.940 --> 06:18.931
(loud rock music playing)

06:22.510 --> 06:24.546
* I thought I was a victim

06:24.580 --> 06:26.844
* That people hated me

06:27.880 --> 06:29.745
* I never had a homeland

06:29.790 --> 06:31.849
* I had no safety

06:31.890 --> 06:33.482
* Huh, yah

06:33.520 --> 06:35.488
* Broke out of the harness *

06:35.520 --> 06:36.680
* Let it go, let it go

06:36.730 --> 06:37.754
* Stumbled in the darkness *

06:37.790 --> 06:39.451
* Turn on the light, y'all

06:39.500 --> 06:41.127
* Overcame the madness *
* Then take your pllls

06:41.160 --> 06:43.162
* Finally righteous *

06:43.200 --> 06:44.599
* I love the beast, y'all

06:44.630 --> 06:46.097
* Broke out of the harness *

06:46.130 --> 06:47.597
* Let it go, let it go

06:47.640 --> 06:48.766
* Stumbled in the darkness *

06:48.800 --> 06:49.539
* Turn on the light, y'all

06:49.570 --> 06:50.935
* Overcame the madness *

06:50.970 --> 06:52.164
* Then take your pills

06:52.210 --> 06:53.768
* Finally righteous *

06:53.810 --> 06:55.778
* I love the beast, y'all.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.643
Excuse me, Your Honor,
do I really have to say?

06:58.680 --> 07:00.773
You do if you want me to rule,
Miss Nyholm.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.811
Lockhart/Gardner has gotten
in the nasty little habit

07:02.850 --> 07:05.819
of pushing legal agenda
through emergency injunction.

07:05.850 --> 07:08.080
You can't decide something that
hasn't happened, Your Honor.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.782
And, as my opposing counsel
well knows,

07:10.830 --> 07:13.719
there is no liver available yet,
so there is nothing to enjoin...

07:13.760 --> 07:15.796
Yes, but as Miss Nyholm
well knows,

07:15.830 --> 07:17.889
when the donor's liver
does become available...

07:17.930 --> 07:19.534
I'm sorry,
I wasn't finished yet.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.197
...there will only be
a 12-hour window of viability

07:21.240 --> 07:23.708
and that is what
Miss Nyholm is counting on.

07:23.740 --> 07:24.729
You have no idea
what I'm counting on.

07:24.770 --> 07:26.101
She is counting
on that liver

07:26.140 --> 07:27.277
being transplanted
into another patient.

07:27.310 --> 07:29.972
And at that point,
there truly will be
nothing to enjoin.

07:30.010 --> 07:31.773
Okay. Can I have
my turn now?

07:31.810 --> 07:32.572
Yes, Your Honor.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.611
I wish Mrs. Florrick
didn't think

07:34.650 --> 07:36.789
she was arguing
before the Supreme Court.

07:36.820 --> 07:38.219
And I wish Miss Nyholm did.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.718
Miss Nyholm, this 12-hour
window of viability

07:40.760 --> 07:43.126
offers insufficient time
for an emergency Injunction,

07:43.160 --> 07:44.923
so your objection is overruled.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.120
Conﬁnue.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.048
So, Marjorie,

07:49.100 --> 07:50.863
when did your liver
start to fail?

07:50.900 --> 07:52.936
Two years ago.
And what happened

07:52.970 --> 07:53.937
a week ago?

07:53.970 --> 07:56.632
There was a match
for my liver.

07:56.670 --> 07:59.036
A young man had been
in a motorcycle accident

07:59.070 --> 08:01.106
and was brain dead.

08:01.140 --> 08:04.849
My name was at the top
of the ORSN list.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.848
I know I sound like an expert
on this stuff,

08:06.880 --> 08:11.715
but you get informed really fast
when you're this sick.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.012
So you were told

08:13.060 --> 08:15.187
that_this donor's liver
was intended for you?

08:15.220 --> 08:16.551
Yes.

08:16.590 --> 08:18.683
You can't believe
how happy we were.

08:18.730 --> 08:21.722
(voice cracking):
My 5... son... oh...

08:21.760 --> 08:23.569
(choking up):
I'm sorry.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.192
(stifling sobs,
sighing)

08:25.230 --> 08:27.232
He's five.

08:27.270 --> 08:31.058
I haven't told him that
there's a... a problem yet.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.772
ALICIA:
What is that problem?

08:33.810 --> 08:35.869
MARJORIE:
I don't know.

08:35.910 --> 08:37.172
All I know is,
my name was removed

08:37.210 --> 08:40.213
from the ORSN list.

08:41.750 --> 08:46.312
And what has the doctor told you
will happen next?

08:46.350 --> 08:49.922
Well... without this liver,

08:49.960 --> 08:52.599
they say I have...

08:52.630 --> 08:55.155
three weeks.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.725
We need to know how
long the donor has.
Got it.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.931
KALIN DA:
How's Alicia doing?

08:59.970 --> 09:02.564
She's got Patti
on her heels.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.272
(low, indistinct chatter,
phone ringing)

09:13.380 --> 09:16.713
DOCTOR:
The motorcycle accident
severed his brain stem.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.809
WOMAN: Is he in pain?
No, he's not.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.989
It's just that there are
people at this hospital

09:21.020 --> 09:24.251
who could benefit... from
this terrible tragedy.

09:24.290 --> 09:26.349
We know, Doctor?

09:26.390 --> 09:27.926
But we need to wait.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.257
NURSE:
I'm so sorry.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.768
WOMAN:
My other son-- we're
sending for him.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.937
That's okay.

09:32.970 --> 09:34.858
You know,
if you need anything...

09:34.900 --> 09:36.765
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.301
MAN:
Hey, guys, all that
stuff's coming in here.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.308
K_ALINDA:
What's g0ing on over there?

09:41.340 --> 09:42.898
NURSE:
I don't know.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.702
We're making space.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.911
KALINDA: _
They won't allow their son
to be unplugged

09:46.950 --> 09:48.042
until his brother

09:48.080 --> 09:50.742
comes from Afghanistan
to see him.

09:50.790 --> 09:54.851
I know I sound like a ghoul
even asking this, but how long?

09:54.890 --> 09:57.688
They're putting him
on a transport tomorrow.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.152
They think three days.

09:59.190 --> 10:00.691
ALICIA:
Objection!

10:00.730 --> 10:01.651
Asked and answered.

10:01.700 --> 10:02.667
PARKS:
Sustained.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.928
Well, let me see if I ask this

10:03.970 --> 10:05.926
to Mrs. Florrick's satisfaction.

10:05.970 --> 10:07.835
What did your
specialist, Dr. Lawton,

10:07.870 --> 10:09.838
tell you exactly was the reason

10:09.870 --> 10:11.906
why you were removed from
the liver contention?

10:11.940 --> 10:14.773
He said my liver failure
was so far advanced

10:14.810 --> 10:18.075
that a new liver would only
be counterproductive.

10:18.110 --> 10:20.010
And you might only live another
six months with the liver?

10:20.050 --> 10:21.142
Yes, but he wasn't sure.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.340
PATTI:
I understand that.

10:22.380 --> 10:25.383
And I'm sorry to ask you this,
Marjorie.

10:25.420 --> 10:30.255
There are only so many viable
livers available for transplant.

10:30.290 --> 10:33.691
Wouldn't it be better to see it
transplanted into someone

10:33.730 --> 10:35.857
who has a better chance
of survwal?

10:35.900 --> 10:40.997
I spent some time in a hospital
over the last two years,

10:41.040 --> 10:42.860
and I know doctors speak of

10:42.910 --> 10:46.004
objective and subjective
medical criteria.

10:46.040 --> 10:51.706
Dr. Lawton's opinion was
subjective medical criteria.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.275
PATTI:
No further questions,
Your Honor.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.244
We ask that we take a recess
for the afternoon.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.212
Objection. Again, Your Honor,
delaying tactics.

10:59.250 --> 11:00.751
One of Mrs. Florrick's
key Witnesses,

11:00.790 --> 11:02.314
Mr. Haynes
from hospital administration,

11:02.360 --> 11:03.850
has been called away
on an emergency.

11:03.890 --> 11:05.027
He's not available.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.857
Your Honor,
this is a shell game.

11:06.900 --> 11:07.992
We'll break for lunch.

11:08.030 --> 11:09.861
Miss Nyholm, you have two hours

11:09.900 --> 11:12.698
to produce this witness
or show cause.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.135
Thank you.

11:15.170 --> 11:17.035
It's my job.

11:17.070 --> 11:19.038
No. You're not like before.

11:19.070 --> 11:20.799
You're fighting for me.

11:22.980 --> 11:25.039
DIANE:
Change of plan. I want you

11:25.080 --> 11:27.139
to take the questioning
of the hospital administrator.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.717
I think you're
getting under Patti's
skin, so keep it up.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.169
Hello.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.326
Phone your boyfriend.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.736
Tell him I need to ask him
something.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.032
My boyfriend?

11:48.070 --> 11:50.038
Will Gardner.
Tell him I want to see him

11:50.070 --> 11:52.709
in 30 minutes or
I'm on to the next.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.832
What?

11:55.880 --> 11:57.177
It's good to see you.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.177
And you.

11:58.210 --> 12:00.075
You've been working out.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.940
(chuckles)
How's the kid?

12:01.980 --> 12:03.140
Good, thanks.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.942
I've been fired.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.048
You've been fired?

12:06.090 --> 12:07.819
By whom?

12:07.860 --> 12:09.282
My firm.
My law firm.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.982
The law firm
I spilled blood for.

12:12.030 --> 12:13.952
They fired me just
this afternoon.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.956
A senior partner informed me.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.060
And are you looking
for a new job?

12:19.100 --> 12:21.398
I'm looking to sue.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.964
$8.6 million.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.865
They fired me
because I'm pregnant.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.332
Really?

12:27.380 --> 12:28.472
You're pregnant?

12:28.510 --> 12:30.000
Iam.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.005
It happens.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.177
Are you thinking of populating
a small island?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.108
You have five minutes,

12:35.150 --> 12:36.469
then I go to
Quinn & Holland.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.942
I think they're still
in the building.

12:37.990 --> 12:41.153
So you go from fighting
with us in the morning

12:41.190 --> 12:42.782
to hiring us
in the afternoon?

12:42.830 --> 12:43.888
Yes.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.024
Why do you find that so
confusing, Mrs. Florrick?

12:47.060 --> 12:48.948
Will doesn't find that
confusing, do you?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.025
You're using our suit,
our donor suit

12:51.070 --> 12:52.492
to get your firm to pay up?

12:52.530 --> 12:55.966
(laughs)
That is so adorably
calculated.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.128
Maybe I just think
you're good lawyers.

12:59.170 --> 13:00.171
You have four minutes.

13:00.210 --> 13:01.507
How did it go today?

13:01.540 --> 13:03.098
Judge Parks likes us.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.345
We have three days
until the liver's available.

13:05.380 --> 13:07.245
Yes, but you don't
know what my firm has

13:07.280 --> 13:08.975
coming down the pike.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.510
Which you can't tell us
or you will get disbarred.

13:10.550 --> 13:13.110
True, but I'm human...

13:13.160 --> 13:15.116
and pregnant.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.186
And who knows what a pregnant
woman in my state might say.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.288
Give me a taste.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.195
We know you're using this

13:21.230 --> 13:23.369
donor suit as a stalking horse

13:23.400 --> 13:25.288
for a multimillion dollar
malpractice

13:25.330 --> 13:27.969
class action against
Harbor Hospital.

13:30.340 --> 13:34.470
The hospital administrator--
he's not out on an emergency.

13:34.510 --> 13:37.399
You wanted to question him,
didn't you, Mrs. Florrick?

13:40.220 --> 13:41.517
You have three minutes.

13:41.550 --> 13:42.642
Do you want my case or not?

13:45.220 --> 13:47.609
They didn't really fire you
because you were pregnant.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.356
Of course they did.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.824
But it makes
a good story aanay.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.064
Then let's sue.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.527
Hello, Alicia.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.629
Hello, Jackie.

14:25.660 --> 14:26.479
May I sit?

14:26.530 --> 14:27.428
You may.

14:27.460 --> 14:31.294
But in 15 minutes
I have to be in court.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.494
Why did you do it?

14:35.540 --> 14:37.963
You're in my office, Jackie.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.228
You've come here
for a speCIfic reason.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.373
I won't be put in
a position of guessing.

14:42.410 --> 14:44.378
You broke up with my son.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.571
I dropped your
children off,

14:46.610 --> 14:48.339
and found
Peter not there.

14:48.380 --> 14:50.382
He was in an apartment
you moved him into.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.183
Yes.
So you waited

14:52.220 --> 14:54.484
until he was elected,
then you made your move.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.978
What move do you imagine
that might be, Jackie?

14:58.030 --> 14:59.657
I have no idea.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.419
I am not in your head.

15:01.460 --> 15:04.566
Your children were looking
for their father.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.158
My children are in school,

15:06.200 --> 15:07.531
and I intend to see them
afterwards

15:07.570 --> 15:08.696
and explain this to them.

15:08.740 --> 15:10.605
And poison them with your bias?

15:10.640 --> 15:12.904
Be cordial here, Jackie,
or I will ask you to leave.

15:15.110 --> 15:17.977
You and I have had our
differences, Alicia,

15:18.010 --> 15:20.114
but I've come to respect you,

15:20.150 --> 15:22.516
and-and admire aspects of you.

15:22.550 --> 15:24.541
But my son is hurting,

15:24.590 --> 15:29.209
and I... I cannot
see him... hurt.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.626
On the day
he should be happiest,

15:31.660 --> 15:34.049
I have never seen him
so destroyed.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.250
This is a private matter,
Jackie.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.165
It is not for you
to get involved.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.634
I've watched Zach and Grace
for two years now.

15:40.670 --> 15:41.739
And I thank you,

15:41.770 --> 15:43.533
but I don't need
your help anymore.

15:43.570 --> 15:45.538
Excuse me?

15:45.570 --> 15:46.969
My children are grown.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.978
They don't need your help.
But thank you.

15:49.010 --> 15:51.001
And I'm glad you got time
to spend together.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.574
How can you talk this way?

15:52.610 --> 15:54.214
Because I am this way.

15:54.250 --> 15:57.185
Your son has made me this way.

15:58.220 --> 16:00.950
My son loves you.

16:06.390 --> 16:08.699
You will see your grandchildren,
Jackie.

16:08.730 --> 16:10.561
Don't worry,
I will make that happen.

16:10.600 --> 16:14.195
And again I thank you.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.538
You were a lifesaver
when I needed a lifesaver,

16:16.570 --> 16:18.128
but that's over now.

16:18.170 --> 16:20.604
And I have to get to court.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.674
Damn you to hell.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.718
Your Honor,
this is not about

16:29.750 --> 16:32.116
one liver. This is_about
their class action.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.050
Mr. Roda, stop. I don't care.

16:34.090 --> 16:36.650
I still have to adjudicate
the case in front of me.

16:36.690 --> 16:38.681
Ms. Lockhart.

16:38.730 --> 16:39.822
It is our understanding
the hospital administrator,

16:39.860 --> 16:42.454
Mr. Haynes, was not called away
on an emergency call.

16:42.500 --> 16:47.528
Instead, he is staying at his
vacation home in Michigan.

16:47.570 --> 16:50.403
We ask that Your Honor
compel his presence in court

16:50.440 --> 16:53.204
or censure opposing counsel
for their deception.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.468
(footsteps approach)

16:58.650 --> 16:59.776
Mr. Roda?

16:59.810 --> 17:02.643
I... Your Honor,
we have no knowledge

17:02.680 --> 17:05.046
of this alleged location.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.684
Well, then, let me get you
their phone and address.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.349
Your Honor, we ask that you
disqualify Lockhart/Gardner

17:13.400 --> 17:14.549
as counsel for the plaintiff.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.660
It's come to our attention
that our retired first chair,

17:17.700 --> 17:19.565
Miss Nyholm,
has hired Diane Lockhart

17:19.600 --> 17:21.636
_ as a counsel
in a swt against us.

17:21.670 --> 17:23.228
Really?

17:23.270 --> 17:26.068
Well, what happened there?

17:26.110 --> 17:27.179
Our firm found it
necessary

17:27.210 --> 17:28.632
to relieve Miss Nyholm
of her position,

17:28.680 --> 17:30.648
and she has since hired
their firm

17:30.680 --> 17:32.102
to sue us for damages.

17:32.150 --> 17:33.572
Miss Nyholm, is this true?

17:33.620 --> 17:36.316
Oh, yeah.
It's really quite dramatic.

17:36.350 --> 17:38.113
I'm sure you can
understand, Your Honor,

17:38.150 --> 17:39.617
Miss Nyholm know
5 our stratagems

17:39.650 --> 17:41.311
and all the specifics
of our defense.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.783
Mr. Roda, I can't tell Miss
Nyholm which firm she can hire.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.128
Yes, but you can insist on
a strict division

17:46.160 --> 17:47.650
between Miss Nyholm's case
and this one.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.190
That's correct.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.562
Miss Nyholm, you do understand
that there

17:51.600 --> 17:53.830
must be a strict division
between these two cases?

17:53.870 --> 17:55.098
I do.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.199
Your Honor,
Miss Nyholm just grinned

17:57.240 --> 17:58.537
and winked at us
when you said that.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.379
I did not.
I don't wink.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.674
Miss Nyholm, without grinning,

18:02.710 --> 18:05.474
do you promise to keep
these two cases separate?

18:05.510 --> 18:06.807
I do, Your Honor.

18:06.850 --> 18:08.408
This is so unprofessional.

18:08.450 --> 18:09.815
Please talk
to my lawyer.

18:09.850 --> 18:11.681
Mr. Andrews, hello.
I'm Will Gardner,

18:11.720 --> 18:12.812
Miss Nyholm's attorney.
It's nice to meet you.

18:12.850 --> 18:13.817
Do you have a moment?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.452
If Patti looks at her
partnership agreement,

18:15.490 --> 18:17.253
she'll see grievances
must proceed through

18:17.290 --> 18:18.359
automatic arbitration first.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.824
Yes, and we're ready;
we have an arbiter on call.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.828
Well, unfortunately, my schedule
won't clear up for a few weeks.

18:22.860 --> 18:25.363
Well, unfortunately,
that's not gonna work for us.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.867
We need you to meet now.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.162
Really? Or...?

18:28.200 --> 18:29.861
Or Patti and I are gonna have

18:29.900 --> 18:32.630
a very long conversation
about class action suits.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.672
And you know how we pregnant
women like to talk.

18:34.710 --> 18:37.201
I will not negotiate
with a gun to my head.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.205
So don't. Just negotiate.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.842
Not if you were
the last man standing, buddy.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.269
Welcome to arbitration.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.187
I am retired Judge Loni Goslin.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.642
This is an automatic process
intended to encourage

18:46.690 --> 18:48.851
the free exchange
of grievances,

18:48.890 --> 18:51.324
and a presentation
of witnesses and exhibits.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.420
And where is your plaintiff
today, Mr. Gardner?

18:54.460 --> 18:56.348
She should be here
any minute.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.662
My apologies,
Your Honor.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.292
I really must insist
on punctuality.

18:59.330 --> 19:01.560
ANDREWS:
Um, your Honor,
I would remind you

19:01.600 --> 19:04.433
of the liquidated damages
provision

19:04.470 --> 19:07.769
in Miss Nyholm's contract
specifying

19:07.810 --> 19:11.348
a $50,000 payout
in such circumstances.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.871
That is far beyond
the $8.6 million

19:13.920 --> 19:15.569
(chuckles)
she is demanding.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.884
Yes, but the provision
doesn't cover punitive.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.615
You fired her because
she was pregnant.

19:19.650 --> 19:21.550
That is such complete
and utter hogwash.

19:21.590 --> 19:23.626
We fired her
because she was

19:23.660 --> 19:25.184
alienating clients.
We were losing people.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.857
As you can see from these
grievance reports,

19:26.890 --> 19:29.927
Miss Nyholm
has extreme mood swings,

19:29.960 --> 19:31.860
moments of temper flashes.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.391
As you can see from
this America Pregnancy
Association report,

19:34.440 --> 19:36.567
those are potential side effects
of a pregnancy.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.909
Oh, come on.
You yourself complained

19:38.940 --> 19:40.669
how she uses her pregnancy.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.632
I am so sorry I'm late.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.478
I was changing diapers.
What a mess.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.910
Oh, my goodness, look at you
with your little hat!

19:47.950 --> 19:50.316
Isn't it sweet?
I knitted it myself.

19:50.350 --> 19:54.354
GOSLIN:
And what a big girl,
you are, aren't you?

19:54.390 --> 19:56.312
PATTI:
I'm so sorry, I thought
I'd have day care today.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.920
GOSLIN:
No, that's okay.
Isn't it okay?

19:58.960 --> 20:00.518
(baby jabbering happily)

20:00.560 --> 20:02.892
KALINDA:
I don't know
how you do it, Zoe.

20:02.930 --> 20:04.488
It must be hard
working here.

20:04.530 --> 20:05.963
Sometimes.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.390
Yeah, I usually look on
the bright side of things.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.431
And sometimes there
isn't a bright side,

20:11.470 --> 20:13.734
so... (sighs heavily)

20:13.780 --> 20:15.805
I have to go home,

20:15.840 --> 20:19.503
take a shower
and wash it off.

20:19.550 --> 20:22.269
Oh, I asked about the
commotion earlier.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.982
Um, we're having someone
in for an operation.

20:25.020 --> 20:27.682
I guess he's pretty big, so
we had to clear some space.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.813
Kevin Haynes.

20:29.860 --> 20:31.851
I am Harbor Hospital's
Associate Administrator.

20:31.890 --> 20:32.959
DIANE:
Thank you, Mr. Haynes.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.526
And how was your emergency?

20:34.560 --> 20:35.788
Objection.
Sustained.
Ms. Lockhart.

20:35.830 --> 20:37.627
My apologies, Your Honor.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.458
Mr. Haynes, tell me
who Jeffrey Berkoff is.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.905
HAYNES:
Who Jeffrey Berkoff is?

20:43.940 --> 20:45.965
An Internet CEO.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.637
Yes, and multimillionaire.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.739
How much has he donated
to your hospital?

20:49.780 --> 20:50.849
Objection, Your Honor.
I'm not sure

20:50.880 --> 20:52.006
what this has to do
with this case.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.415
I'm not sure either,

20:53.450 --> 20:55.668
so why don't we find out
together?

20:55.720 --> 20:58.541
Was my client, Marjorie Garnett,
removed from the donors list

20:58.590 --> 20:59.841
so that Mr. Berkoff could
receive a liver?

20:59.890 --> 21:00.857
HAYNES:
No, not at all.

21:00.890 --> 21:03.654
But Mr. Berkoff is
being flown in to receive

21:03.690 --> 21:05.021
this liver right now, isn't he?

21:05.060 --> 21:07.290
Room _in the Donors' Suite
is being made for him?

21:07.330 --> 21:10.993
Yes, but that has nothing to do
with Miss Garnett's case.

21:11.030 --> 21:13.999
The allocation of organs
is an objective matter

21:14.040 --> 21:15.894
governed by
the ORSN computers.

21:15.940 --> 21:19.808
The only relevant factors
are organ suitability, age...

21:19.840 --> 21:21.671
And the advance of the disease

21:21.710 --> 21:22.972
which is determined
by a specialist?

21:23.010 --> 21:24.978
Yes, but...
So the computers

21:25.010 --> 21:26.841
put Miss Garnett
at the top of the list,

21:26.880 --> 21:29.314
but a Harbor Hospital doctor
removed her from it?

21:29.350 --> 21:31.511
We||_... _ _ _
that's an over5implification.

21:31.550 --> 21:34.713
Did you know that
Jeffrey Berkoff donated $600,000

21:34.760 --> 21:35.988
to your hospital?

21:38.030 --> 21:39.588
You're far away from home.

21:39.630 --> 21:41.996
I need your help.
Okay.

21:42.030 --> 21:43.998
What's going on
with Lockhart/Gardner?

21:44.030 --> 21:46.021
You're worried about your job?

21:46.070 --> 21:47.731
_ Peter Florrick
isn't gonna want the guy

21:47.770 --> 21:49.328
who made an enemy of his wife.

21:49.370 --> 21:52.498
Diane was sniffing
around me for a while

21:52.540 --> 21:54.098
to have me come back, but

21:54.140 --> 21:56.677
I think Will had
some concerns.

21:56.710 --> 21:58.575
Can you talk to him?

21:58.610 --> 22:00.009
WILL:
Really?

22:00.050 --> 22:02.769
Well, I don't think that's gonna
fly with Miss Nyholm.

22:02.820 --> 22:04.082
$1 million.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.317
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

22:08.090 --> 22:09.580
Of course Miss Nyholm

22:09.620 --> 22:10.780
didn't tell us about Berkoff.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.979
We have our own

22:12.030 --> 22:13.657
investigator here.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.895
He hung up on me.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.898
(baby fussing over monitor)
I don't think
he takes you seriously.

22:17.930 --> 22:20.433
Or you.

22:22.840 --> 22:23.465
(baby jabbering over monitor)

22:23.510 --> 22:25.034
She's a piece of work, huh?

22:25.070 --> 22:26.628
And yet she has her moments.

22:26.670 --> 22:28.638
Congratulations on Peter,
by the way.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.999
I saw his speech,
it was good.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.576
Are you excited?

22:32.610 --> 22:34.771
I'm... busy.

22:35.820 --> 22:37.617
I bet he will be, too.

22:37.650 --> 22:40.619
Why don't you take a week off
after all this.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.911
(baby babbling over monitor)
Spend some time with him.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.018
PATTI (over monitor):
Hello there.

22:43.060 --> 22:44.027
You waking up?

22:44.060 --> 22:45.823
Little sleepyhead.

22:45.860 --> 22:47.953
You want to hear a story?
No.

22:48.930 --> 22:51.091
Once there was
Turn it back up.

22:51.130 --> 22:52.427
a big castle,
What?

22:52.470 --> 22:54.961
with many wonderful machines
in it.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.734
And all the machines
cost a lot of money to keep up.

23:00.780 --> 23:05.046
And so the king had to keep
using the machines

23:05.080 --> 23:07.412
and charging for their use.

23:07.450 --> 23:08.576
Good story.

23:08.620 --> 23:11.714
And so,
when all the king's horses

23:11.750 --> 23:15.015
and all the king's men
came to the castle,

23:15.060 --> 23:17.756
they were charged
exorbitant prices.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.929
(sighs)

23:29.770 --> 23:32.762
Your dad and I
have separated.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.169
You...

23:36.210 --> 23:37.609
What?

23:37.650 --> 23:39.140
Why?

23:39.180 --> 23:41.876
Because...

23:41.920 --> 23:43.888
we decided it was time.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.218
I-I don't understand.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.786
Why now?

23:51.630 --> 23:55.020
Because I wanted to now.

23:57.230 --> 24:00.666
This was all just to get
Dad elected, wasn't it?

24:00.700 --> 24:01.928
What?

24:01.970 --> 24:03.562
Staying together.

24:03.610 --> 24:06.761
The day after the election,
you get separated.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.869
Yes, but that is not
the reason why.

24:08.910 --> 24:09.808
Then why?

24:12.710 --> 24:16.919
I needed to see
if the marriage would work.

24:16.950 --> 24:19.589
And it hasn't.

24:19.620 --> 24:22.509
Y_our dad has moved
into an apartment

24:22.560 --> 24:24.926
a few miles away.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.484
My God, we're those kids.

24:26.530 --> 24:29.897
No, you're not those kids--
you're our kids.

24:29.930 --> 24:31.693
I know this is hard,

24:31.730 --> 24:33.960
but I need you to deal
with this a little while longer.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.968
So what, do we just
go back and forth?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.934
I don't know.

24:37.970 --> 24:39.904
We haven't worked out
the details.

24:43.110 --> 24:45.977
ButI need something more
from you.

24:46.010 --> 24:50.640
People are interested
in what happens to us,

24:50.690 --> 24:55.184
so I need you to keep
our current situation

24:55.220 --> 24:57.859
from anyone
outside the family.

24:57.890 --> 25:00.029
'Cause it will
hurt Dad?

25:00.060 --> 25:01.891
Yes.

25:01.930 --> 25:03.761
And it could
hurt us, too.

25:03.800 --> 25:07.224
I think that there's
a lot of attention

25:07.270 --> 25:10.933
to families like ours,
and I...

25:10.970 --> 25:12.631
I don't want to feed that.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.774
But, Mom... Mom, it's lying.

25:14.810 --> 25:16.573
That's hypocritical.

25:16.610 --> 25:20.546
Yes. And you two are old
enough to understand that.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.218
We don't lie here.

25:22.250 --> 25:25.788
We... we don't lie
to each other,

25:25.820 --> 25:28.152
but when people want to hurt us,

25:28.190 --> 25:33.856
it's sometimes all right
to not tell the full truth.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.993
You understand?

25:36.030 --> 25:37.588
Uh-huh.

25:38.630 --> 25:40.188
Grace?

25:42.170 --> 25:44.206
Mom, you need
to protect us more.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.231
(inhales sharply)

25:48.010 --> 25:49.773
(sobbing)

25:49.810 --> 25:52.278
Oh, Mom, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

25:52.310 --> 25:53.811
No.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.845
(crying)
I love you so much.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.859
You didn't ask for any of this.

26:00.890 --> 26:03.256
And I...

26:03.290 --> 26:05.121
We're good. We're gonna be good.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.889
We're gonna be good.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.168
Okay, so here's
where we stand.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.760
Patti's clearly
pointing us

26:18.810 --> 26:21.335
in a direction, but she's
not filling in the blanks.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.177
So see what you can get
on hospital over-testing.

26:23.210 --> 26:25.599
I have someone in the hospital
I can talk to.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.069
Hey...

26:30.120 --> 26:33.009
you should give Cary a chance.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.655
A chance to what?

26:35.690 --> 26:37.089
Come back here.

26:46.970 --> 26:48.335
Hey.

26:48.370 --> 26:49.894
Hello.

26:49.940 --> 26:50.929
Hello?

26:50.970 --> 26:52.130
Everything all right?

26:52.170 --> 26:54.309
Yep. Got to get to work.
Sure.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.389
When did you get billed?

27:05.420 --> 27:09.186
Uh, sorry, I must have
left them at home.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.757
I was looking at the bill
and I was surprised

27:11.790 --> 27:14.099
to see that there
were tests on there

27:14.130 --> 27:15.927
that I don't
remember approving.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.756
CT scans?

27:16.800 --> 27:19.223
That sounds right.
Was it Dr. Lawton?

27:19.270 --> 27:20.760
Yeah.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.267
He can be a bit

27:22.300 --> 27:24.359
_ overca_uti_ous
With the radiation scans.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.298
He's actually been warned
about it a few times.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.978
Same with the other doctors.

27:28.010 --> 27:29.136
Just challenge it.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.431
Okay. Thank you.

27:30.480 --> 27:31.902
No problem.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.679
Hey, do you want
to get lunch sometime?

27:36.350 --> 27:38.443
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.139
Um, uh, forget it.

27:40.190 --> 27:43.853
I just don't really meet
that many nice people.

27:43.890 --> 27:45.118
No, no, sure.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.821
Th-That sounds nice.

27:46.860 --> 27:47.997
Give me your number.

27:48.030 --> 27:49.327
Great.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.464
I don't believe it.
JACKIE:
It's true.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.967
But why?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.331
Because she's selfish.

27:54.370 --> 27:55.860
Oh, stop it.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.299
She won't swallow
her pride.

27:57.340 --> 27:58.830
She won't forgive him.

27:58.870 --> 28:00.007
It's easier
to leave him.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.871
Jackie, it
isn't the '505.

28:01.910 --> 28:03.104
What did she say?

28:03.140 --> 28:05.005
Alicia-- she said nothing.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.006
And Peter won't say
anything either.

28:07.050 --> 28:08.745
But he's devastated.

28:08.780 --> 28:10.372
I need you to talk to her.

28:10.420 --> 28:12.183
You need me?

28:12.220 --> 28:14.279
She likes you.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.413
You can
explain things.

28:16.460 --> 28:19.156
You know it's bad for Peter.

28:19.190 --> 28:22.057
It's bad for home,
it's bad for work.

28:24.870 --> 28:29.990
* The itsy-bitsy spider
went up the waterspout... *

28:30.040 --> 28:31.860
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

28:31.910 --> 28:34.231
This is the only way I can
get her to fall asleep.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.271
Oh, that's okay, really.

28:36.310 --> 28:38.039
ANDREWS:
Let me guess--
you couldn't find day care.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.047
Again.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.911
Your Honor,
we would like

28:40.950 --> 28:42.747
introduce something
into evidence we_
were hoping to av0id.

28:42.780 --> 28:44.816
Oh, I'm sure you were.
Our firm wanted

28:44.850 --> 28:46.989
to relieve Miss Nyholm
of her duties quietly,

28:47.020 --> 28:48.157
because, the truth is,

28:48.190 --> 28:50.158
we discovered she
was stealing clients.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.249
Miss Nyholm tried
to steal their business

28:52.290 --> 28:55.054
and start her own firm.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.351
(baby jabbers)

28:56.400 --> 28:57.526
Well?

28:57.560 --> 28:59.790
Of course I was trying
to start my own firm,

28:59.830 --> 29:01.991
because I knew
they were trying to fire me.
Yeah, but they weren't

29:02.040 --> 29:04.361
trying to fire you
because you were pregnant.
They were trying

29:04.410 --> 29:06.935
to fire me because
I have a working vagina.

29:06.970 --> 29:08.471
And because Jerry Maguire

29:08.510 --> 29:11.308
Roda out there
is their new golden boy.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.170
Of course it was
about my pregnancy.

29:13.210 --> 29:16.316
Is there an e-mail out
there saying that? No.

29:16.350 --> 29:18.887
Would you write
that e-mail, Will?

29:18.920 --> 29:21.889
Of course not, but
you'd still do it.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.888
Take all the cases
away from the pregnant woman

29:23.930 --> 29:26.148
and give them to the new
Harvard boy with the penis.

29:26.190 --> 29:28.351
Where are we?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.028
Cross-examination
of the hospital administrator.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.367
Hit them hard,

29:32.400 --> 29:35.130
because what happens there
is scaring them here.

29:35.170 --> 29:36.296
ALICIA:
Hello, Dr. Lawton.

29:36.340 --> 29:37.295
You're Marjorie Garnett's
specialist?

29:37.340 --> 29:38.830
Yes, I am.

29:38.870 --> 29:40.201
And you're the doctor
who decided

29:40.240 --> 29:43.209
her condition was so extreme
you removed her

29:43.240 --> 29:44.070
from transplant consideration?

29:44.110 --> 29:46.169
Well, I was the doctor
who examined her

29:46.210 --> 29:47.973
and tested her and found

29:48.020 --> 29:50.215
her live_r tumor_had
exceeded five centimeters,

29:50.250 --> 29:52.514
which is routinely the cutoff
for patient viability.

29:52.550 --> 29:54.211
You mentioned testing.
How many CT scans

29:54.260 --> 29:55.579
did you run
on Marjorie?

29:55.620 --> 29:57.508
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Objection. Relevance?

29:57.560 --> 29:59.824
I'm asking about
Marjorie's care.

29:59.860 --> 30:01.259
It seems essentially relevant.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.426
PARKS:
Overruled.
You may answer, Doctor.

30:02.460 --> 30:05.429
I believe I ran
three CT scans.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.266
Why?

30:06.300 --> 30:08.063
Why did I run three?

30:08.100 --> 30:09.829
Sometimes I like to be
more thorough.

30:09.870 --> 30:11.906
You seem to frequently
be more thorough.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.305
Didn't the hospital
warn you

30:13.340 --> 30:15.171
about your overuse
of radiation testing?

30:15.210 --> 30:16.529
RODA:
Objection,
Your Honor. Again.

30:16.580 --> 30:18.172
This is a fishing expedition.

30:18.210 --> 30:19.848
Okay. I admit
to being lost here.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.279
What fish are you afraid
Mrs. Florrick is chasing?

30:21.320 --> 30:23.515
She is attempting
to use an ongoing investigation

30:23.550 --> 30:25.017
into Harbor Hospital into...

30:25.050 --> 30:26.244
(coughs)
Excuse me.

30:26.290 --> 30:28.155
ALICIA:
I think the word
you're looking for

30:28.190 --> 30:29.316
is over-testing.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.351
Your Honor,
we request a short recess

30:32.390 --> 30:34.153
_ to talk
With the plaintiff's attorney.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.624
PARKS:
Anything that gets us
to a settlement, I am all for.

30:37.660 --> 30:40.322
We have a sworn affidavit
from the donor databank.

30:40.370 --> 30:44.602
We knew nothing about the next
potential donee on that list.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.108
It was completely blind.
It doesn't matter
what you knew.

30:47.140 --> 30:48.630
It matters
what Dr. Lawton knew.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.375
But you're not
looking closely enough.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.105
Dr. Lawton didn't know.

30:52.150 --> 30:55.278
No one knew who the computers
would assign that liver to.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.548
We still have you
on over-testing.

30:56.580 --> 30:57.945
HAYNES:
Yes, you do, ma'am.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.309
And we're vulnerable
on that front,

30:59.350 --> 31:01.352
but that still
doesn't change the fact

31:01.390 --> 31:02.379
that you're stealing a liver

31:02.420 --> 31:04.524
from one worthy candidate
to give to another.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.528
We have looked
at your worthy candidate.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.290
He's ten months
away from death.

31:09.330 --> 31:13.664
I'm fighting your suit,
Ms. Lockhart, Mrs. Florrick,

31:13.700 --> 31:16.032
and you know Why?

31:16.070 --> 31:18.334
Because we're right.

31:18.370 --> 31:20.668
_ This is not_
about saVIng the hospital money.

31:20.710 --> 31:23.634
This is about preserving
the integrity of the donor list.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.171
Marjorie Garnett is near death,

31:26.210 --> 31:30.078
and she needs
to accept that fact.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.418
You two need to, as well.

31:40.630 --> 31:42.029
(inhaling deeply)

31:42.060 --> 31:43.550
I heard.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.295
We have 12 hours.

31:45.330 --> 31:46.558
Yes.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.397
We haven't given up yet.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.135
I know.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.432
I haven't, either.

31:51.470 --> 31:55.099
As far as we can tell,
the doctors didn't know

31:55.140 --> 31:57.370
the organ would go
to Jeffrey Berkoff,

31:57.410 --> 31:59.378
so we don't have
that avenue anymore.

31:59.410 --> 32:01.469
(sighs)

32:04.250 --> 32:06.389
You know,

32:06.420 --> 32:08.411
I loved being a mom.

32:08.460 --> 32:12.021
IfI had it to do
all over again, I...

32:12.060 --> 32:14.528
I would have done it
differently.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.994
Really?

32:17.030 --> 32:18.668
It looks like it was fun.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.998
(laughs)

32:21.040 --> 32:23.497
Well, I wouldn't have done it
all differently.

32:26.210 --> 32:28.508
(voice breaking):
I don't want to die.

32:28.540 --> 32:32.044
What will he
remember of me?

32:42.260 --> 32:43.557
Has Dr. Lawton seen these?

32:43.590 --> 32:45.228
Oh, yeah.

32:45.260 --> 32:48.127
He says I was
quite the partier.

32:50.130 --> 32:52.098
CARY:
It's just odd.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.394
Last time I was here,
you were firing me.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.567
DIANE:
A lot of water
under that bridge.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.138
So, Cary, you've proven
yourself valuable

33:00.170 --> 33:01.706
in the State's
Attorney's office,

33:01.740 --> 33:04.345
and we're starting
to look to expand,

33:04.380 --> 33:07.178
but we're always wanting a...

33:09.350 --> 33:11.341
...balance of personalities.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.416
Okay.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.588
I guess I'm wondering,
will you still fit in here?

33:18.630 --> 33:21.292
Well,

33:21.330 --> 33:25.061
I have done a lot of
growmg, being away.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.523
So I want to fit in,

33:27.570 --> 33:29.458
wherever I go.
And you won't mind

33:29.500 --> 33:32.367
coming over to the dark side?

33:32.410 --> 33:33.763
(laughing)

33:33.810 --> 33:35.437
Ithink I'll find it
a challenge.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.505
So you'd be Willing to come back
as a second-year associate.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.474
That won't feel like
a step down?

33:42.280 --> 33:44.248
Uh...

33:44.290 --> 33:46.042
Thought I'd be coming back
as a third-year.

33:48.090 --> 33:49.580
Yes. But your second year

33:49.620 --> 33:52.054
was with the State's Attorney's
office, so...

33:52.090 --> 33:54.229
It's only a title, Cary.

33:54.260 --> 33:57.491
We'd still offer all of
the perks and salary bumps

33:57.530 --> 33:58.667
that I discussed.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.637
Sorry.

34:02.670 --> 34:05.559
Look, I've seen the way
third-years treat second-years.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.100
It's not just a title.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.437
DIANE:
Cary, listen.
We're growing again.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.574
And as we grow,
we're hiring people back.

34:11.610 --> 34:15.410
And we can't break precedent
by giving something to you

34:15.450 --> 34:16.474
that we don't give to others.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.771
Think about it, Cary.

34:17.820 --> 34:20.288
And Alicia will be a third-year?

34:26.390 --> 34:27.823
Eli, I have to prepare
for a cross-examination.

34:27.860 --> 34:29.259
This will only
take a minute.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.619
And it's important.

34:30.660 --> 34:32.196
I'm about to argue
for a woman's life.

34:32.230 --> 34:32.992
Is it more important than that?

34:33.030 --> 34:35.294
Okay, I thought
I could top that.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.331
No.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.830
You separated from Peter.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.341
Peter told you?

34:44.380 --> 34:46.348
Jackie.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.676
The second that phone rings,
I have to go.

34:52.720 --> 34:54.312
Is it irrevocable?

34:54.360 --> 34:55.486
My decision to leave Peter?

34:55.520 --> 34:56.817
Yes.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.420
Okay. Wait.

34:59.460 --> 35:00.654
Does that mean
it will change or...?

35:03.930 --> 35:06.797
I don't want to ask you why,
but you do know this Will look

35:06.830 --> 35:08.229
politically motivated.

35:08.270 --> 35:11.159
Not the separation,
the marriage.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.633
I've already talked
to Zach and Grace.

35:13.670 --> 35:16.173
And you should talk to Peter.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.508
It will hurt everyone
if this becomes a big thing.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.178
Yeah. Okay.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.710
Have you thought about
couple's counseling?

35:22.750 --> 35:25.480
No.
I know I'm not the best

35:25.520 --> 35:28.216
advertisement for it, but my
ex-Wife and I went through it.

35:28.260 --> 35:31.752
And it wasn't...
as bad as I thought.

35:31.790 --> 35:33.428
Thank you.

35:33.460 --> 35:34.859
And thank you for

35:34.900 --> 35:36.595
not trying to
talk me out of it.

35:36.630 --> 35:37.619
Should I try?

35:37.660 --> 35:40.493
(phone rings)

35:40.530 --> 35:42.532
Yeah.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.401
Gotta go.

35:45.440 --> 35:46.634
Go save a life.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.171
ALICIA:
Dr. Lawton,

35:48.210 --> 35:50.235
who is Marcus Orr,
Sheryl Kirk

35:50.280 --> 35:52.475
and Gabriel Elba?
They are my patients.

35:52.510 --> 35:56.446
And like Marjorie, they suffered
from liver failure?

35:56.480 --> 35:58.687
Yes.
But unlike Marjorie,

35:58.720 --> 36:00.483
they received
liver transplants.

36:00.520 --> 36:03.648
How many CT scans did you
order performed on each?

36:03.690 --> 36:04.554
I don't remember.

36:04.590 --> 36:06.558
One?

36:06.590 --> 36:07.955
That sounds about right.
And who are

36:07.990 --> 36:09.890
LeeLee Basso, Cynthia Hickey
and Linda Gould?

36:09.930 --> 36:11.659
Also my patients.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.691
And how many CT scans
did you perform on them?

36:13.730 --> 36:15.391
Again, you're going
to have to tell me.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.192
Three, four and five.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.639
Which is odd,

36:18.670 --> 36:20.706
being that the last three
patients, and my client,

36:20.740 --> 36:21.900
are almost 20 years younger.

36:21.940 --> 36:24.977
Well, as I said, age is not
always a determining factor.

36:25.010 --> 36:27.444
Yes, but

36:27.480 --> 36:29.414
appearance seems to be.

36:30.650 --> 36:31.685
PARKS:
Sustained.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.757
Dr. Lawton, of all your
liver patients, these are

36:34.790 --> 36:36.348
the only four patients

36:36.390 --> 36:38.381
with tattoos and body piercings.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.990
I-I don't remember,
I don't keep track.

36:41.030 --> 36:42.691
During your examination
of Marjorie,

36:42.730 --> 36:43.924
you asked her
how much alcohol

36:43.960 --> 36:45.461
she consumed in her youth,
is that correct?

36:45.500 --> 36:47.718
I don't know. Probably.

36:47.770 --> 36:49.397
And Why is that
important to know?

36:49.440 --> 36:50.964
Well, it's not
essential to know.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.365
It helps contribute to

36:52.410 --> 36:55.436
a fuller picture
of the patient's lifestyle.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.368
And Why is lifestyle important?

36:57.410 --> 36:59.571
Well, as a doctor...

36:59.610 --> 37:01.919
How shall I put this?

37:01.950 --> 37:04.987
Any way you want.

37:05.020 --> 37:08.353
Lifestyle matters to the future
health of a patient.

37:08.390 --> 37:09.789
Are you more likely
to downgrade the status

37:09.820 --> 37:11.981
of a woman you blame
for her liver condition?

37:12.030 --> 37:13.952
No.

37:13.990 --> 37:15.457
Then how can you explain

37:15.500 --> 37:17.297
the need for subjecting

37:17.330 --> 37:19.821
these four patients--
and only these four patients--

37:19.870 --> 37:21.462
to additional CT scans?

37:21.500 --> 37:23.934
I don't think I-I
have to explain.

37:23.970 --> 37:26.268
I am a very careful doctor.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.270
HAYNES:
This is the most

37:30.310 --> 37:31.470
I can offer.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.944
I am having another doctor
look over the first CAT scans,

37:33.980 --> 37:35.675
and if he doesn't find
anything irregular

37:35.720 --> 37:38.985
in Miss Garnett's test, we'll
hopefully have time to reassess.

37:39.020 --> 37:41.386
Not _much time.
Six hours.

37:41.420 --> 37:43.411
Then I'd better get going.

37:46.060 --> 37:47.357
There's a chance.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.618
Oh, my God.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.651
Nothing's
certain yet.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.379
DIANE:
Thank you, Mr. Haynes,
for taking a closer look

38:03.410 --> 38:05.002
at Dr. Lawton's
overuse of CAT scans.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.006
And thank you for determining
there was bias there.

38:07.050 --> 38:08.847
ANDREWS:
I would object
to that characterization.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.542
Mr. Haynes reversed
Dr. Lawton's decision

38:11.590 --> 38:13.546
in the case of Marjorie Garnett.

38:13.590 --> 38:15.512
He_did_ this for
humanitarian reasons:

38:15.560 --> 38:17.949
to save Miss Garnett's life.
And once again,
thank you.

38:17.990 --> 38:21.824
But that has no impact on this
negotiation: your class action.

38:21.860 --> 38:23.555
WILL:
Well, it sure
doesn't look good.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.022
There are four patients
we know already

38:25.070 --> 38:26.765
who suffered from
Dr. Lawton's bias.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.995
My guess is we turn up more.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.429
My guess is bias
is in the eye of the beholder.

38:31.470 --> 38:33.028
Well, it's too bad we have
a former lawyer of yours

38:33.070 --> 38:34.162
who can help us on that front.

38:34.210 --> 38:37.771
I am so sorry I'm late.
Are we all playing nice in here?

38:37.810 --> 38:39.004
Very nice.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.342
You...

38:43.380 --> 38:45.041
Yep.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.513
They fired Roda,
and asked me back.

38:47.550 --> 38:49.552
Isn't it great?

38:49.590 --> 38:51.421
With better benefits.

38:51.460 --> 38:52.779
So I dropped the lawsuit.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.752
But thank you so much, Will.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.529
Really.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.425
It probably wouldn't have
happened without you.

38:58.470 --> 39:01.439
We'll object to your using
anything you discovered from us.

39:01.470 --> 39:02.835
I couldn't have discovered
anything from you,

39:02.870 --> 39:05.361
because you stood up in court
and swore to a strict

39:05.410 --> 39:06.729
separation of these cases.

39:06.770 --> 39:08.874
(chuckling)

39:09.940 --> 39:12.773
So. Shall we get started?

39:24.160 --> 39:26.526
No.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.584
We're talking.

39:27.630 --> 39:29.097
We talked.

39:29.130 --> 39:30.597
We're talking some more.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.377
I don't want our children
hearing this.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.489
I phoned a marriage counselor.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.409
Her name is
Anne Gerbadine.

39:56.460 --> 39:59.020
She's very thorough,
she seems very smart,

39:59.060 --> 40:01.927
and I'm going to start
seeing her next week.

40:03.730 --> 40:06.198
I don't want _to
lose you, AliCia.

40:06.230 --> 40:09.461
If you ask me to give up the
State's Attorney's office today,

40:11.640 --> 40:13.858
Luclq me.

40:17.580 --> 40:20.048
I know you're hurt.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.446
I know you're angry...
No, Peter.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.448
It's a "no."

40:24.490 --> 40:26.446
What is?

40:26.490 --> 40:28.185
Everything.

40:28.220 --> 40:30.711
Counseling.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.182
An explanation.

40:32.230 --> 40:37.054
Anything you ask,
anything you say.

40:47.110 --> 40:49.601
You're sleeping with Will,
aren't you?

40:49.640 --> 40:53.201
That's what this
is about, isn't it?

40:53.250 --> 40:55.138
You and Will.

40:55.180 --> 40:58.240
There have been
three people

40:58.280 --> 41:00.089
in this marriage.

41:00.120 --> 41:02.179
Every moment of
the last two years,

41:02.220 --> 41:03.414
you've been thinking
about him.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.553
Go ahead, tell me
that's not true.
Oh, my God, the gall!

41:05.590 --> 41:09.594
I'll take the blame for What
I did. I'll take it happily.

41:09.630 --> 41:10.927
But you share that.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.099
IS that why you're here?

41:13.130 --> 41:14.734
To disperse blame?

41:14.770 --> 41:16.761
Really?

41:16.800 --> 41:17.892
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

41:17.940 --> 41:19.862
Are you divorcing me?
I haven't decided.

41:19.910 --> 41:22.674
Well, please, let me
know when you decide.

41:22.710 --> 41:24.940
Yep. You and Kalinda.
I've got her number, too.

41:25.980 --> 41:28.005
She's blameless in this.

41:29.980 --> 41:31.618
Oh, really?

41:31.650 --> 41:32.742
Did you rape her?

41:32.790 --> 41:35.054
She didn't even
know you then.

41:35.090 --> 41:37.081
She knew you were married.

41:39.290 --> 41:41.952
It's okay.
It's all right, Alicia.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.149
Have at it.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.724
You're the injured one.

41:44.770 --> 41:46.795
No one else.

41:46.830 --> 41:48.593
There's nothing
anyone can say, right?

41:48.640 --> 41:49.959
Yes, there is.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.036
So say something.
Say something, Peter.

41:52.070 --> 41:54.300
Say something
that'll make me

41:54.340 --> 41:56.638
fall in love With you again.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.601
Good-bye.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.143
Yep. You got that right.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.547
Well, you must be thinking
about the old Peter Florrick,

42:07.590 --> 42:10.150
because _I'm not in the
favor-granting mood today.

42:10.190 --> 42:11.657
(knock on door)

42:11.690 --> 42:13.055
Yeah?
Cary Agos,
Mr. Florrick.

42:13.090 --> 42:15.320
I work in the State's
Attorney's office.

42:15.360 --> 42:18.329
I'm not making any hiring
or firing decisions.

42:18.360 --> 42:20.169
I understand that.
I just want to...

42:20.200 --> 42:22.566
You understand that,
but you're still here.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.659
I don't want you to be
biased against me

42:24.710 --> 42:25.859
because of my first job.

42:25.910 --> 42:27.798
All decisions will be based on

42:27.840 --> 42:29.330
seniority
and departmental needs.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.369
Ijust...

42:30.410 --> 42:33.777
I know Alicia and I,
we've had our differences.

42:33.810 --> 42:36.347
*

42:36.380 --> 42:37.847
And at first,
Ithought

42:37.880 --> 42:39.711
the best thing
was just to let it go.

42:39.750 --> 42:41.342
But I think it's better
to explain things.

42:41.390 --> 42:44.188
And you know Alicia from...?

42:44.220 --> 42:46.188
Lockhart/Gardner.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.629
* Broke out of the harness *

42:47.660 --> 42:49.651
* Let it go, let it go

42:49.700 --> 42:51.793
* Stumbled in the_darkness *
* Turn on the light, y'all

42:51.830 --> 42:54.298
* Overcame the madness *
* Then take your pills

42:54.330 --> 42:56.867
* Finally righteous *
* I love the beast, y'all

42:56.900 --> 42:59.698
* Broke out of the harness *
* Let it go, let it go

42:59.740 --> 43:02.334
* Stumbled in the darkness *
* Turn on the light, y'all...
