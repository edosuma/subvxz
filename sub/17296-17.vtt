Uh-huh.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.113
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.116
Interesting.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.031
Yes. Follow the trail.

00:33.816 --> 00:36.036
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.733
- No.
- Well, if you must know,

00:37.776 --> 00:39.300
I am collecting evidence.

00:39.343 --> 00:40.866
Evidence? Of what?

00:40.910 --> 00:43.086
I won't know until I find it.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.174
I wants to help.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.175
Sorry, Beast Boy.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.742
This is a job for a...

00:53.488 --> 00:55.055
Master Detective!

00:55.098 --> 00:56.621
"Master Detective"?

00:56.665 --> 00:59.668
That is a very impressive
title you have given yourself.

00:59.711 --> 01:00.843
I know.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.367
And what makes you
a master detective?

01:03.411 --> 01:05.065
Three essential qualities.

01:05.108 --> 01:08.111
Number one.
A master detective can find out anything

01:08.155 --> 01:10.679
from small, seemingly
unimportant details.

01:10.722 --> 01:13.334
For instance, I can
deduce from this stain

01:13.377 --> 01:15.205
and the cool breeze
coming from the kitchen

01:15.249 --> 01:17.207
that you ate ice cream
from the carton

01:17.251 --> 01:19.209
and didn't close
the freezer door.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.168
That is all true.

01:21.211 --> 01:22.517
That's exactly what I did!

01:22.560 --> 01:25.085
Number two. A master
detective must have

01:25.128 --> 01:27.174
an extremely broad
base of knowledge

01:27.217 --> 01:28.914
on any given subject.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.916
Go ahead. Ask me anything.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.571
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
How come trees are so tall?

01:33.615 --> 01:35.573
In order to maximize
exposure to sunlight.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.358
For this reason,
forest trees in particular

01:37.401 --> 01:39.055
will grow tall due to their
proximity to one another.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.405
However, a solitary maple
growing in an open field

01:41.449 --> 01:43.103
will grow wide rather than tall

01:43.146 --> 01:45.409
due to the fact that it simply has
more room to grow and expand,

01:45.453 --> 01:47.194
thus maximizing
sunlight exposure

01:47.237 --> 01:48.760
through width
rather than height.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.589
That's a lot of info, yo.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.417
Number three,
and most important,

01:53.461 --> 01:57.117
a master detective knows to dig
deeper when he's onto something.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.770
You means, like, with a shovel?

01:58.814 --> 02:00.511
Yes! A brain shovel.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.296
Like the time you said
you couldn't come

02:02.339 --> 02:04.428
to my birthday
because you were sick.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.865
Now, an average person
would've said, "Feel better."

02:06.909 --> 02:10.173
But instead, I hid in
the bathroom for 24 hours,

02:10.217 --> 02:12.088
waiting for proof
of this sickness.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.612
It never came.

02:14.656 --> 02:17.180
Wow. I thoughts
I fooled you good.

02:17.224 --> 02:20.444
Attention to detail, extensive
knowledge, and gut instinct.

02:20.488 --> 02:23.360
These are the three qualities
that define me as a...

02:24.274 --> 02:26.624
M-m-m-master Detective!

02:26.668 --> 02:28.800
Okay, if you're such
a master detective,

02:28.844 --> 02:30.759
tell me what's up with
the animals on the rock.

02:30.802 --> 02:33.022
- Animals?
- The ones that live on the rock out there.

02:33.065 --> 02:35.981
They change once a year
or about every 52 adventures.

02:36.025 --> 02:39.637
Indeed. The rock was previously
inhabited by the pelican bird.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.944
And before the pelican was that crab.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.555
And don't forget my seagull
brother from a feathered mother.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.514
He was first up
on that rock, yo.

02:46.557 --> 02:48.168
Of course I've noticed
that there have been

02:48.211 --> 02:49.604
three other animals
living there,

02:49.647 --> 02:52.172
each for a year
and they've all gone missing.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.477
I wonder what happened
to all of 'em.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.479
Perhaps the rock
is not the rock,

02:55.523 --> 02:58.613
but the rock monster that eats
one sea creature per year.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.180
Or maybe they got
some sick inheritance

03:00.223 --> 03:02.225
and they're living it up
in style somewhere else.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.662
They was probably
picked up by some aliens

03:04.706 --> 03:07.491
and they's getting
experimented on right now!

03:07.535 --> 03:09.493
Or they just ate each other.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.234
Like what happens
all the time in nature.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.890
Good guesses all around,
except yours, Raven.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.283
That's boring.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.110
The answer is obvious.

03:18.154 --> 03:21.897
The animals are being
planted there to spy on us.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.247
Sounds like a stretch.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.293
Who is using the aquatic animals

03:26.336 --> 03:27.859
to do the spying on us?

03:27.903 --> 03:31.472
That is a question only a
master detective can answer.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.343
We'll start with what we know.

03:33.387 --> 03:36.259
Or in this case, who we know.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.873
Keep your guard up, Titans.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.006
This guy is
a slippery character.

03:45.747 --> 03:48.793
Ah, your plan is to ask
the octopus questions?

03:48.837 --> 03:50.795
Interrogation is one of
the many tools

03:50.839 --> 03:53.233
in the Master Detective's
Tool Box.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.799
Okay, but he can't talk.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.148
Oh, he'll talk.

03:56.192 --> 03:57.933
They all talk.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.022
What have you done with the
pelican, the crab and the seagull?

04:01.371 --> 04:03.243
Oh, I cannot help it.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.593
He is the adorable!

04:05.636 --> 04:08.726
Isn't that correct,
Mr. The Squishy Face?

04:08.770 --> 04:10.293
Oh, yes, you are.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.599
Oh, yes, you are.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.821
Stop tickling the suspect!

04:18.606 --> 04:21.913
Oh, beautiful.
It is changing the colors.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.088
Ah-ha!

04:23.132 --> 04:25.221
He's attempting
to camouflage himself.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.310
Now I know
you're hiding something.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.877
Who are you working for? Who?

04:28.920 --> 04:32.359
It stings! It burns!

04:32.402 --> 04:34.665
Ah, so you're a real
tough guy, huh?

04:34.709 --> 04:37.277
Well, I don't need
your confession.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.061
You've already
told me everything.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.280
Behold!

04:41.629 --> 04:43.761
Wait. Those are just
random markings.

04:43.805 --> 04:45.502
Oh, maybe you're right, Raven.

04:45.546 --> 04:48.375
These marks are small,
insignificant details

04:48.418 --> 04:51.726
until you press them together!

04:53.815 --> 04:56.687
He's found the triangle!
He has found it.

04:56.731 --> 04:59.386
You are the Master
Detective-ator, baby!

04:59.429 --> 05:01.170
What's that triangle
mean, though?

05:01.213 --> 05:03.999
The triangle tells me
everything I need to know.

05:04.042 --> 05:07.176
It is the ancient symbol
of a sinister secret society

05:07.219 --> 05:11.136
bent on controlling the world without
anyone ever knowing they even exist.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.660
The...

05:15.315 --> 05:16.446
The Illuminati.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.448
So obvious.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.276
Oh, come on.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.147
Where to next, Master Detective?

05:22.191 --> 05:23.714
To get to the bottom of this,

05:23.758 --> 05:25.890
we'll have to go
to the bottom...

05:25.934 --> 05:27.501
Of the ocean.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.035
Wow.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.950
Ooh!

05:45.519 --> 05:48.043
We're coming up
on the base of the rock now.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.485
Ah-ha! Barnacles!

05:55.529 --> 05:57.835
Barnacles?
That's your big clue?

05:57.879 --> 05:58.967
Barnacles?

05:59.010 --> 06:00.534
Yes, barnacles.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.667
If you had an extensive knowledge
of all things, like I do,

06:03.711 --> 06:07.802
you would know that barnacles live
almost exclusively in shallow waters,

06:07.845 --> 06:10.413
and yet, we are
hundreds of meters deep.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.198
What's it mean, Master Detective?
What's it mean?

06:13.242 --> 06:14.678
It means, my dear boy,

06:14.722 --> 06:16.854
that these barnacles are fakes

06:16.898 --> 06:19.553
and are mostly likely
a hidden switch.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.948
Whoa!

06:27.691 --> 06:30.215
Master Detective!

06:30.259 --> 06:31.695
How does he do it?

06:31.739 --> 06:33.697
I don't know how he does it

06:33.741 --> 06:35.482
but he just keeps on
does-ing it!

06:35.525 --> 06:38.223
Go, Robin!
Go, Master! Detective!

06:38.267 --> 06:39.268
What, what, what!

06:39.311 --> 06:40.661
He just cracked the rock open.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.402
This doesn't prove anything.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.012
Oh, ye of little faith.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.230
We shall see.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.581
We. Shall. See.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.939
Wow. A big, empty cave.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.900
We're closer than ever to
finding those animals, Titans.

07:02.944 --> 07:06.600
Now sit back and watch
the Master Detective work.

07:08.123 --> 07:11.735
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Let's see,
up here. Uh-huh. Interesting.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.607
Nope.
Come on, come on.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.086
There must be
a trick stalagmite, or...

07:15.130 --> 07:16.653
Or maybe these pebbles
are a clue!

07:16.697 --> 07:18.350
All right.
This is a waste of time.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.875
A real master detective would've
found those animals by now.

07:20.918 --> 07:24.574
All you've been doing is making absurd
leaps of logic based on nothing.

07:24.618 --> 07:27.185
We have been here
for the several hours.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.753
Yeah. Maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.713
Atatatata! Do you hear that?

07:32.756 --> 07:34.758
- No.
- Listen. Shh.

07:34.802 --> 07:37.065
- We hear the nothing.
- What is it, bro?

07:37.108 --> 07:39.763
I hear something! Shh.

07:41.156 --> 07:44.376
It's my gut and it's
telling me something.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.682
What's it telling you, bro?

07:45.726 --> 07:48.685
It's telling me that
I'm onto something.

07:48.729 --> 07:51.035
And that means it's time
to dig deeper!

07:51.079 --> 07:52.297
With your brain shovel?

07:52.341 --> 07:53.473
That's right.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.783
Robin, I think it's time to stop...

07:59.827 --> 08:02.264
I knew it! "Something."

08:03.831 --> 08:06.224
The symbol of the Illuminati.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.530
Yes!

08:09.097 --> 08:12.100
M-m-m-master Detective!

08:23.546 --> 08:27.463
The Illuminati's plan for
world domination all laid out.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.334
You were right.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.553
Of course I was!

08:30.597 --> 08:32.947
It was only a matter of time.

08:39.997 --> 08:43.827
We cannot hide from
the Master Detective forever.

08:43.871 --> 08:48.528
I am Lumino,
head of the Illuminati!

08:50.007 --> 08:52.532
Save it, triangle man.
We came here for answers.

08:52.575 --> 08:57.537
I suppose there's no harm in walking you
through our plan for world domination.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.234
We did work hard on it.

08:59.277 --> 09:02.367
It all starts here
with the banks.

09:02.411 --> 09:03.673
We don't care about the banks.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.632
- Tell us about the animals.
- "Animals"?

09:05.675 --> 09:08.243
The pelican, the crab
and the seagull, fool.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.332
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Whoa!

09:10.375 --> 09:11.638
Playing dumb, eh?

09:11.681 --> 09:13.683
Then we'll have to do this
the hard way.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.250
Titans, go!

09:16.512 --> 09:18.601
Conspiracy cover-up!

09:18.645 --> 09:20.908
Illuminati laser!

09:25.216 --> 09:27.567
Conspiracy crush!

09:30.526 --> 09:32.354
Grassy knoll gaze!

09:43.104 --> 09:45.585
Now talk.
Where are the animals?

09:45.628 --> 09:47.021
Really, I don't know!

09:47.064 --> 09:49.066
I'll stop all
the domination plans.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.242
I'll pull my lizard-men
out of Congress.

09:51.286 --> 09:54.419
We'll stop using Hollywood
to hasten the New World Order.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.204
Just let me go.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.468
It appears we may
have hit a dead end.

09:59.511 --> 10:02.906
Hold up. All of this and we still
don't know where the animals are?

10:02.950 --> 10:05.256
You, sir,
are no master detective.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.954
You let us down, fool.

10:06.997 --> 10:10.914
You are a master
of the disappointment.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.046
I...

10:12.089 --> 10:14.265
I don't know what went wrong.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.311
You were right, Raven.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.400
I'm not a master detective.

10:20.881 --> 10:24.580
I'm nothing if I can't even
find three dumb animals!
