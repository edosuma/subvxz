                    You-- Wha--

22:07.794 --> 22:09.827
             Welcome to America,
                 Mr. Millay.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.562
            Can I take your hat,
                    sir?

22:11.597 --> 22:12.729
Uh, Major Nelson, I--

22:13.966 --> 22:15.933
You still here?

22:15.968 --> 22:17.601
          Still here?

22:17.636 --> 22:19.970
      But I just got here.

22:20.005 --> 22:24.508
And there was no one to meet me
        at the airport.

22:24.543 --> 22:25.943
      Oh, that's too bad,

22:25.978 --> 22:27.778
but I'll see to it that someone
         takes you out

22:27.813 --> 22:30.948
   to the airport to catch
the next plane back to France.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.450
      Catch the next plane
        back to France?

22:33.485 --> 22:38.656
 But I flew 3000 miles in order
 to see our genuine Rembrandt.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.324
 I'm sorry we had to disappoint
           you, sir.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.993
 If you want my candid opinion,
        Monsieur Millay,

22:43.028 --> 22:45.963
       as an art critic,
    you're highly overrated.

22:47.899 --> 22:50.867
        Carl was right.

22:50.902 --> 22:53.837
    All Americans are crazy!

22:56.309 --> 22:57.507
           I go home!

22:57.543 --> 22:59.310
            Monsieur.

23:03.749 --> 23:05.182
   Uh, art expert.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.651
 Well, at-- At least he can tell
        a phony Rembrandt

23:07.686 --> 23:09.220
               when he sees one.
       Mm.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.922
  Oh, there's one thing that's
been bothering me, Major Nelson.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.424
Yes, uh, just before we went in
 to see, uh, General Peterson,

23:14.460 --> 23:16.227
uh, you were about to make
      a confession.

23:16.262 --> 23:17.728
               Oh, oh, ye-- Yes.
     Yes.

23:17.763 --> 23:22.366
    And, um, I was, um, uh--
Just wondering, uh, what it was.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.600
             Uh-- Oh! Ah, yes.

23:23.635 --> 23:25.135
       I just wanted to tell you
               that, um--

23:25.171 --> 23:27.071
     Uh, yes?
       Yes?

23:27.106 --> 23:31.208
     I-- I didn't think I'd ever
        really be a Rembrandt.

         [ALL LAUGHING]

23:47.059 --> 23:49.760
And then when I said I wanted to
dance with him, he turned white.

23:49.795 --> 23:52.596
         Oh, I don't blame him.
       You're a terrible dancer.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.432
        Oh, poor Dr. Bellows.

23:55.468 --> 23:58.268
       They are sending him away
            for a long rest.

23:58.303 --> 24:00.337
   Well, I think he deserves
            a rest.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.638
       Hey, have you decided

24:01.673 --> 24:03.540
     where you're going to hang
         my painting yet?

24:03.575 --> 24:04.674
    Yeah. Right there.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.543
          Right there?
  Right-- Right-- Right where?

24:06.578 --> 24:07.644
     Right there--
        Jeannie.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.949
                 Oh, very funny.

24:11.984 --> 24:15.619
   Well, I still don't know why
    no one bid on my picture.

24:15.654 --> 24:17.988
  Oh, perhaps they are not yet
  ready for you, Major Healey.

24:18.023 --> 24:19.256
                    Well,
             maybe you're right.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.558
        I really enjoyed
     painting that picture.

24:21.593 --> 24:23.393
 It was the most relaxing thing
          I ever did.

24:23.428 --> 24:25.329
 Then you must paint more often,
             master.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.731
             Yeah,
     but it looks so easy.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.866
         I wish I knew
     how Rembrandt did it.
