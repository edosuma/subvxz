WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:16.480 --> 00:17.320
All right!

00:37.880 --> 00:38.960
No sign of Guédira.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.560
But we have Sernine.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.360
Thank you, Captain. OK.

00:45.720 --> 00:46.720
Back to Paris.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.760
-We have to watch him closely.
-Of course.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.840
Have you found my son?

01:02.360 --> 01:03.680
Have you found my son?

01:04.840 --> 01:06.640
A theft, a break-in, a kidnapping…

01:06.720 --> 01:08.440
We have a lot to talk about!

01:10.480 --> 01:12.960
-Have you found him?
-Where's my colleague?

01:34.440 --> 01:37.320
Thomas, my dear Thomas, a few weeks ago,

01:37.400 --> 01:40.400
we fell victim to a terrible injustice.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.840
The foundation was robbed.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.840
But we refuse to be intimidated.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.880
That's why, this evening,
we're organizing a dinner

01:48.400 --> 01:50.640
which generous donors will attend.

01:50.720 --> 01:54.200
Citizens who believe in
the future of our country.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.880
A worthy initiative!

01:55.960 --> 02:00.400
Every young person, no matter
their background, deserves to be inspired.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.760
That'll be the role,
the mission of our foundation:

02:03.840 --> 02:07.000
access to the nation's
highest cultural institutions.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.880
And we will succeed.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.840
We'll end on that note.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.720
Thank you both.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.120
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.200
Your appointment's here.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.400
I don't have one.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.240
Would you excuse me?

03:11.920 --> 03:13.640
What did you find inside the car?

03:15.040 --> 03:18.520
Don't answer. He's messing with us.
It won't work.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.760
I'm not!

03:20.400 --> 03:21.680
Was there a body or not?

03:23.120 --> 03:25.560
-Answer me!
-Want to know what was inside?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.720
There was nothing!

03:28.360 --> 03:29.520
Inside the trunk…

03:30.680 --> 03:32.920
This is what was inside! A can!

03:33.000 --> 03:34.920
Now please stop pissing us off.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.120
We need to stop.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.360
-Don't even think about it.
-What?

04:19.040 --> 04:20.120
I will shoot.

04:21.960 --> 04:22.800
Don't worry.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.400
I won't escape before Paris.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
Thanks for the info.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.680
-I need the bathroom.
-Hold it in.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.400
-I can't.
-No bathrooms here.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.160
There are. Over there.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.080
-Take him to the bathroom?
-Hold this.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.640
Let's go.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.120
Stop.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.480
-You're not coming in?
-No.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.480
Don't lock the door.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.880
Hector?

05:49.400 --> 05:50.240
Relax.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.160
I'm not a serial killer.
I just stole some jewels. OK?

06:04.400 --> 06:05.680
-Hector?
-Yes?

06:05.760 --> 06:07.600
-You need to come in here.
-Why?

06:08.400 --> 06:10.120
I can't do anything
with these handcuffs.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.920
-Do you want a receipt?
-Yes.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.720
Thank you.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.920
Thank you, miss. Bye.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.240
Sir! Police.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.920
-You have a flat tire.
-Really?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.360
-Which one?
-Back right.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.680
Look.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.840
-It was the other car.
-Belkacem!

06:50.920 --> 06:53.320
-Belkacem!
-No, Hector!

06:57.280 --> 06:58.120
No!

07:05.280 --> 07:06.120
Shit!

07:11.720 --> 07:13.240
Shit! Fucking hell!

07:31.640 --> 07:33.000
I don't work with cops.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.760
Fuck.

08:21.240 --> 08:22.280
No.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.920
I'm here! Help!

08:26.360 --> 08:27.440
Raoul!

08:27.520 --> 08:30.320
Over here! Help!

08:31.560 --> 08:33.320
Raoul, I'm here. Don't worry.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.760
-I'm here!
-Help!

08:47.360 --> 08:49.080
Help me!

08:49.760 --> 08:52.200
Open up!

08:56.240 --> 08:58.800
Raoul! OK? I'm here, don't worry.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.840
-Where's my father?
-I don't know.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.120
Come on!

09:21.640 --> 09:24.440
Hurry up! Quickly!

09:24.520 --> 09:25.800
Hurry up!

09:25.880 --> 09:27.880
Come on! Quickly, get in.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.600
-How does this work?
-Who are you?

09:32.680 --> 09:35.680
A friend of your dad's. A cop.
I'll get you out of here.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.680
All good!

10:14.760 --> 10:15.840
Where's my father?

10:18.600 --> 10:20.560
Your father and I share the same passion.

10:21.640 --> 10:22.480
Arsène Lupin.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.760
He's a fan.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.640
I know he is. So am I.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.640
Your fave character?

10:31.040 --> 10:32.680
-Ganimard.
-Ganimard?

10:32.760 --> 10:35.120
Yes. He's a cop like me, of course.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.160
-What about you?
-Arsène Lupin.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.320
-Arsène Lupin in Arsène Lupin. Good job.
-Yeah.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.840
You can't choose the best character
for no reason.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.680
He reminds me of my dad.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.640
My dad…

10:55.160 --> 10:56.600
He's my favorite person.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.120
You got me there.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.040
Diop was in an abandoned farm.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.760
-We sent our guys in to arrest him…
-And?

11:12.280 --> 11:13.360
He escaped.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.200
Well, you have his son.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.800
-Oh?
-Isn't the North African one of yours?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.320
Guédira? He's not on the case.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.320
But he has the Diop kid.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.880
-His son?
-Yes. That's very good news.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.160
He figures out we have his son?
We won't have to look for him.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.760
We'll use the kid as bait.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.680
He'll come to us.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.520
Guédira will bring us the kid.
Bring you the kid.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.600
We'll let Diop know he's with us.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.440
We wait for him. You arrest him.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.520
You and my men.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.760
You're putting me in a delicate position.

11:56.520 --> 12:00.080
-We're acting outside of any procedure.
-Who gives a damn, Dumont?

12:01.400 --> 12:05.360
He's the most wanted man in France.
Your superiors will be grateful.

12:05.960 --> 12:06.800
So?

12:07.600 --> 12:08.720
Are you in or out?

12:10.760 --> 12:12.440
What if he calls the police?

12:14.760 --> 12:17.000
He's a player, Dumont.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.800
A boxing match needs two contestants.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.040
So?

12:25.360 --> 12:26.400
It's risky.

12:33.560 --> 12:34.680
But worth a shot.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.400
GREAT JOB WITH THE DIOP KID

13:01.480 --> 13:02.840
CALL ME

13:10.880 --> 13:12.200
What would Lupin do?

13:12.280 --> 13:14.400
-You a fan of Lupin?
-Yes, I love it.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.600
I CAN'T TALK, I'M DRIVING

13:45.000 --> 13:47.200
BRING THE KID TO THE PARK HYATT HOTEL

13:47.280 --> 13:48.800
I'LL EXPLAIN

13:48.880 --> 13:50.880
I'M ON MY WAY

13:59.520 --> 14:00.480
Hello.

14:00.560 --> 14:05.120
Dad, I've added a few introductory lines
to my speech. Can I read them to you?

14:05.600 --> 14:08.120
Today, the source of creativity

14:08.200 --> 14:11.160
doesn't only belong
to traditional social classes.

14:11.240 --> 14:15.040
The blending of cultures
towards which the foundation works

14:15.120 --> 14:18.760
must be the breeding ground
for innovative creativity.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.240
It's great.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.360
-Is this it?
-On the corner.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.080
-Who are these guys?
-I don't know.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.680
-Are you Raoul?
-Yes.

14:36.680 --> 14:37.840
You're Guédira?

14:37.920 --> 14:40.280
-You work with Commissioner Dumont?
-Yes.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.680
Pascal Oblet. Cop.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.560
Why aren't you at the Hyatt Hotel?
Dumont is there.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.800
-Why the Hyatt Hotel?
-It's dangerous here.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.520
Why? What's going on?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.880
-Did they catch our guy?
-Just obey.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.520
Take the kid to the hotel.
We'll chat later.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.400
It will be fine.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.840
I'll let them know you're coming. Go on.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.520
-Quit worrying.
-I'm not. I'm just asking.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.320
-They'll love you.
-Thank you.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.000
Don't forget to mention the tax benefit.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.600
-That's what people like.
-You've told me a million times.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.160
-You're annoying!
-Where are you going?

15:20.240 --> 15:22.600
-My room is on the eighth floor.
-Really?

15:23.280 --> 15:25.920
-That's new.
-You need to ascend in life.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.400
The kid's on his way.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.480
We'll order a pizza,
stick him in front of the TV.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.960
We'll call his dad,
tell him to come pick him up.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.520
Perfect. My men are in position.
Let's let Diop do the rest.

16:19.000 --> 16:19.840
Dumont.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.360
Tie.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.360
Yes, sir.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.160
A few weeks ago,
we fell victim to a terrible injustice.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.640
The foundation was robbed.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.400
We refuse to be intimidated.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.040
We're organizing a dinner

16:38.120 --> 16:40.480
which generous donors will attend.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.360
Citizens who, like myself,
believe in the future of our country.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.880
Nothing will stop us
from launching this initiative.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.480
Have a seat.
Mr. Bouchard will be here shortly.

17:55.680 --> 17:59.400
Hello, this is Lorenzo Callegari,
the owner of the violin store.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.760
I got your letter and,
to answer your question,

18:02.840 --> 18:04.160
I should think it fair

18:04.240 --> 18:07.840
if this young man were to be punished
as severely as possible.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.360
Keep me posted. Thanks. Have a nice day.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.360
So, Assane Diop.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.560
What now?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.560
I don't get you.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.480
You're attending a good school,
free of charge.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.600
You have it all.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.560
You have to ruin everything.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.280
Don't follow in your dad's footsteps.

18:43.920 --> 18:47.240
You're too young to be charged,
but we can't leave it at that.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.320
Take responsibility.

18:49.400 --> 18:53.080
I've asked Mr. Callegari
about the most appropriate punishment.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.400
As soon as he replies,
you and I will have a chat. Understood?

18:57.480 --> 18:58.920
What if he doesn't reply?

18:59.560 --> 19:00.680
I'll visit his store.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.400
Please.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.440
Hello.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.240
Guédira!

19:39.200 --> 19:41.400
I underestimated you. I was wrong.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.440
How are you? Not too hard going?

19:44.240 --> 19:46.240
-Good job!
-What are we doing here?

19:46.320 --> 19:47.280
Where's Sernine?

19:49.360 --> 19:50.440
All right, listen.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.360
The case went all the way to the top.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.840
We can't let him mock us anymore.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.480
People in high places want results.

19:58.560 --> 20:01.120
I need to take care of this case
personally.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.160
Additionally,
I've received new information.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.080
We believe the kid is in danger.

20:09.960 --> 20:10.960
What information?

20:11.560 --> 20:12.920
It's confidential.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.760
All I can tell you, anyway,
is that with me the kid is safe.

20:18.840 --> 20:19.800
Thanks, Guédira.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.160
Wait.

20:21.800 --> 20:22.920
I don't understand.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.800
Hang on now.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.000
Do I need to convince you
to obey my order?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.520
Raoul, come here please.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.520
I'm going to leave you
with Commissioner Dumont.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.280
I want to go home
and see my mother.

20:43.360 --> 20:46.040
Don't you worry, young man.
It's almost over.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.040
Hello?

21:08.640 --> 21:10.720
-Dad? I'm at the Hyatt Hotel.
-Raoul?

21:10.800 --> 21:13.560
Don't worry, I'm on my way! You OK?
Did they hurt you?

21:14.080 --> 21:14.920
Raoul?

21:24.640 --> 21:25.480
Look at me.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.920
-What's your name?
-Raoul.

21:30.000 --> 21:30.840
Raoul.

21:33.080 --> 21:33.920
I'm Hubert.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.120
Hubert Pellegrini.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.920
I'm holding a fundraising gala
for children like you.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.520
-Like me?
-Kids whose parents are criminals.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.680
-My parents aren't like that.
-Yeah?

21:46.520 --> 21:49.680
Tell me,
what does your father do for a living?

21:51.320 --> 21:52.240
You don't know?

21:54.880 --> 21:55.920
I'll tell you.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.480
What his father did before him.
He steals.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.440
-That's not true!
-He's a thief. Arrogant.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.480
-That's a lie.
-He doesn't care about you or your mom.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.560
You're lying!

22:10.200 --> 22:11.080
You're right.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.040
Your father's on his way.

22:13.840 --> 22:14.680
Don't worry.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.080
You'll soon be reunited.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.320
Guédira?

22:33.960 --> 22:36.560
I was looking for you. This is for you.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.640
-Thanks.
-See you.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.480
THANK YOU GANIMARD

22:49.600 --> 22:50.920
Thank you.

22:51.680 --> 22:54.360
Dear friends, dear peers,
join me in welcoming

22:54.440 --> 22:58.280
the president of the foundation,
Juliette Pellegrini.

22:58.360 --> 22:59.280
Bravo!

23:00.640 --> 23:02.120
-Bravo!
-Thank you.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.040
Thank you.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.320
Good evening all.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.640
Not everyone has had the opportunity
to have access to culture

23:12.720 --> 23:14.600
the way I did.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.400
I was able to visit
the most beautiful museums,

23:18.480 --> 23:20.440
attend the most wonderful operas.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.240
There were no limits with my father,
as you can imagine.

23:25.120 --> 23:29.160
Culture should be accessible to all,
with no distinctions.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.480
That's the mission of this foundation.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.840
The reason for which
we're reaching out to you today.

23:36.720 --> 23:37.560
Not hungry?

23:49.480 --> 23:50.720
Your loss. It's good.

23:53.880 --> 23:54.720
Hey.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.360
Never seen so much money in a single room.
It's crazy.

24:01.800 --> 24:02.640
Thank you.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.320
Keep it.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.880
-I'm trying to quit.
-Thanks.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.240
OK, copy that.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.560
Sir?

25:03.640 --> 25:05.400
Hey, sir!

25:56.840 --> 25:57.800
It's him.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.360
We've seen him in the basement.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.320
He doesn't stand a chance.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.560
Don't move!

26:26.600 --> 26:29.960
The suspect's in the basement.
Close the kitchens, access to the floors.

27:31.520 --> 27:32.880
I should find it fair

27:32.960 --> 27:36.560
if this young man were to be punished
as severely as possible.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.400
Keep me posted. Thanks. Have a nice day.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.920
You destroy the tape.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.560
It won't change anything.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.800
Mr. Bouchard will go to the store
if he doesn't get an answer.

27:47.560 --> 27:48.800
That'd be even worse.

27:49.920 --> 27:50.760
I know.

27:54.520 --> 27:59.360
The foundation's launch party
will take place in a few weeks.

27:59.960 --> 28:04.040
We will have the privilege
of attending a symphony orchestra.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.840
-Yes, sir?
-Dumont…

28:12.600 --> 28:15.280
-We've lost him.
-Is he still in the building?

28:15.360 --> 28:18.280
Knowing him,
he won't just give up like that.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.800
Get the kid out of here.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.640
What? Are you sure?

28:22.160 --> 28:24.880
We've lost control.
The child is our only card.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.440
We can't risk losing him.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.760
-Evacuate him from the hotel.
-Yes.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.280
A car will be waiting for you.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.040
My men will take the child
to a secured place.

28:35.880 --> 28:36.720
OK, sir.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.080
Yes, hello?

29:26.600 --> 29:27.640
The car is here.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.640
In the parking lot.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.400
Are you there?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Yes, we are, sir.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.960
-The black van?
-That's right.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.520
-Once the car has left, come find me.
-Yes.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.880
Go on.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.040
I have to take my leave.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.480
HUBERT PELLEGRINI

30:38.840 --> 30:40.200
-Yes?
-The situation's serious.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.160
We fell victim to a terrible injustice.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.000
-What?
-The foundation was robbed.

30:45.080 --> 30:46.760
We refuse to be intimidated.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.520
What's going on?

30:49.480 --> 30:51.560
-I don't understand.
-Come with me.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.880
This is awesome! The voice!

30:57.960 --> 30:58.920
This is sick.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.280
Hi, this is Lorenzo Callegari.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.720
I received your letter.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.840
To be honest, I've thought it through.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.600
Everyone makes mistakes.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.040
This young man deserves a second chance.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.200
Besides, I've got my violin back.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.200
It's in perfect condition.
Let's leave it at that.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.960
Thank you, and have a nice day.

31:24.040 --> 31:24.880
It's worked?

31:24.960 --> 31:28.400
The principal has never heard
Lorenzo's voice. I'm hoping.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.520
A few weeks ago, we fell victim

31:36.600 --> 31:38.040
to a terrible injustice.

31:38.760 --> 31:40.440
The foundation was robbed.

31:41.480 --> 31:45.800
We fell victim to a terrible injustice,
Dumont. The foundation was robbed.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.440
The foundation was robbed.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.600
The foundation was robbed.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.600
The foundation was robbed.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.640
Get the kid out of here.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.960
-What? Are you sure?
-We've lost control.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.640
The child's our only card.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.360
-We fell victim to a terrible injustice.
-What?

32:12.440 --> 32:15.760
Our foundation was robbed.
We refuse to be intimidated.

32:39.240 --> 32:42.000
Are you really a thief?
That's why they kidnapped me?

32:56.240 --> 32:58.160
You're old enough to understand now.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.240
25 years ago,
Pellegrini framed my dad as a thief.

33:07.920 --> 33:08.760
And today…

33:10.720 --> 33:11.880
he's targeting you.

33:15.680 --> 33:16.800
He'll pay for that.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.800
How far will you go, Dad?

33:27.440 --> 33:29.680
-Mom says you'll never change.
-I will.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.120
Once this has been sorted out.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.840
I promise things will change.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.040
You know what…

33:52.840 --> 33:54.600
If you want me to stop, tell me.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.040
I'll stop everything.

34:02.520 --> 34:03.480
No.

34:05.880 --> 34:06.720
Keep going.

34:17.880 --> 34:18.880
I love you, son.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.800
I love you too, Dad.

34:29.520 --> 34:30.680
Let's go home.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
24 HOURS EARLIER

35:16.160 --> 35:18.520
FORMER INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST
COMMITS SUICIDE

35:18.600 --> 35:19.600
HER FIGHT GOES ON

35:25.960 --> 35:28.160
Excuse me. May I take your newspaper?

35:28.760 --> 35:29.600
Thank you.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.560
FORMER JOURNALIST COMMITS SUICIDE
HER FIGHT GOES ON

36:14.160 --> 36:18.160
-Why would I know about that?
-You've always known about everything.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.280
Listen, Ben.

36:24.120 --> 36:25.600
Raoul has been kidnapped.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.600
I think Pellegrini did it.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.200
I need your help.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.800
He's going to find Raoul.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.800
-He always finds a way out.
-Not this time.

36:46.640 --> 36:47.480
Please.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.160
I want to find my son.

37:08.440 --> 37:11.560
-The voice was identical, I swear!
-All right, Dumont!

37:12.480 --> 37:14.720
One thing I learned in business,

37:15.400 --> 37:17.200
you always need a back-up.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.840
Have a drink on me, Dumont.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.200
You don't intimidate me.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.440
Taking my son is the worst you could do.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.960
I want my child. You want your necklace.

37:38.040 --> 37:40.000
So, I want to make you an offer.

37:41.800 --> 37:42.640
Which is?

37:55.920 --> 37:58.040
I get my son back, you get the rest.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.840
I don't want the necklace.

38:12.680 --> 38:13.880
I want Assane.

39:15.320 --> 39:18.080
Open the door,
and go inside your room. OK?

39:20.680 --> 39:21.520
OK?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.840
Just one moment with my son.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.560
Mom?

39:50.160 --> 39:51.000
Mom?

40:17.240 --> 40:18.080
Run.
