WEBVTT

00:08.220 --> 00:09.530
Okay.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.010
Ohh...

00:14.490 --> 00:17.500
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:17.700 --> 00:18.810
Oh, God.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.720
[line ringing]

00:20.920 --> 00:22.370
- [cellphone rings]
- Hello?

00:22.570 --> 00:25.680
<i>Detective?</i>
<i>It's Judge Dockery.</i>
<i>Do you have a minute?</i>

00:25.880 --> 00:28.420
I just pulled into
my driveway.
It's been a day.

00:28.620 --> 00:31.170
<i>- What's up?</i>
- I need to talk to you
in person right away.

00:31.370 --> 00:33.170
- It's about a case.
- Which case?

00:33.370 --> 00:35.040
<i>Just come to my house. </i>
<i>I'll explain when you get here.</i>

00:35.240 --> 00:37.650
Please hurry.
I'm scared.

00:37.850 --> 00:39.250
[phone clicks]

00:42.470 --> 00:44.530
Judge Dockery?

00:44.730 --> 00:46.390
Front door was open!

00:46.950 --> 00:48.440
Is every--

00:48.640 --> 00:50.260
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

00:57.050 --> 00:58.360
Alice?

01:21.690 --> 01:23.440
- [baby crying]
- Can I give you this?

01:23.630 --> 01:25.740
[crying stops]

01:25.940 --> 01:27.740
[softly] Yeah.

01:27.940 --> 01:29.620
There you go.
There you go.

01:29.810 --> 01:31.350
[knock on door]

01:34.480 --> 01:35.970
Heya, Herbie!

01:36.170 --> 01:37.710
[softly] Ah.
This is for later.

01:37.910 --> 01:39.540
Thought you were
getting in later.

01:39.740 --> 01:42.240
I caught the earlier
Northeast Regional.

01:42.440 --> 01:43.800
Oh, w-why would you
take the Regional?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.630
So much
needless stopping.

01:45.830 --> 01:48.810
There's no such thing
as a needless stop, Herbie.

01:49.010 --> 01:51.420
Time is the ultimate luxury,

01:51.620 --> 01:53.900
a thing to be savored,

01:54.100 --> 01:58.510
not hoarded, nor compressed,
nor controlled,

01:58.710 --> 02:02.520
as if any of us can control
time in the first place.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.650
Anyway, I'm sure
you didn't invite me down here

02:05.850 --> 02:08.950
to debate the merits
of public transportation...

02:09.820 --> 02:12.010
or to watch you
housekeep.

02:12.210 --> 02:13.700
No, yeah, no.
Of course.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.700
Man, I-I-I will never
get used to

02:15.900 --> 02:18.490
the crushing volume of stuff
required for someone so small.

02:18.690 --> 02:21.580
And why does all of it
have to make noise?
You know what I mean?

02:21.780 --> 02:24.930
Like, I am surrounded by pink,
plastic torture devices.

02:25.130 --> 02:26.800
It can be that way
with dogs, too.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.590
I know a miniature Dachshund,
Larry.

02:29.790 --> 02:32.030
That little guy's
got <i>tons</i>of stuff.

02:32.230 --> 02:34.250
Oh, uh, Holly made sure
you had clean sheets

02:34.440 --> 02:36.330
on the spare bed and
extra towels in the bathroom.

02:36.530 --> 02:40.290
Ah, don't worry about me.
Where <i>is</i>Holly, by the way?

02:40.490 --> 02:43.210
I was hoping
to catch her band.

02:43.410 --> 02:46.560
What are they called again?
The Vegan-somethings.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.170
The, uh-- Uh, no, the, uh--
No. Meat Vegans!

02:50.370 --> 02:52.440
- The Vitameatavegemins.
- Ah.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.740
Yeah.
Post-punk klezmer.

02:54.940 --> 02:57.400
She's got a gig
in Charlotte tonight.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.310
You married
the Jewish Debbie Harry.

03:00.510 --> 03:03.270
Oh, well, maybe Debbie Harry
is the Jewish Debbie Harry.

03:03.470 --> 03:05.670
I wouldn't know.
But good for you, Herbie.

03:05.870 --> 03:08.060
Now, tell me
why I'm here.

03:08.260 --> 03:10.110
Need your advice, Red.

03:10.310 --> 03:12.070
I'm not sure if you know
about the murder

03:12.270 --> 03:14.420
of Judge Alice Dockery
a few weeks back.

03:14.620 --> 03:17.380
She was killed
shortly after
presiding over the trial

03:17.570 --> 03:19.460
of the infamous mob boss
Paul Bruno,

03:19.660 --> 03:21.770
now spending his golden years
in federal prison.

03:21.970 --> 03:24.770
Bruno's son, Paul Jr.,
was charged
with the judge's murder.

03:24.970 --> 03:27.780
His defense lawyer
wants me to consult
on the forensics of the case.

03:27.980 --> 03:29.000
Retribution is their theory.

03:29.190 --> 03:31.820
From what I know
of Paul Sr.,

03:32.020 --> 03:35.350
retribution is a dish
he generally serves cold.

03:35.550 --> 03:38.920
This crime is...
decidedly hot.

03:39.120 --> 03:44.840
He has nothing to gain
by tasking his only son
with a revenge killing.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.530
Yeah, I mean, I agree.

03:46.730 --> 03:49.230
But the thing is,
<i>everybody</i>in law enforcement

03:49.430 --> 03:51.280
sees this
as an open-and-shut case.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.330
They're hungry to take down
the whole Bruno family,
and this is their ticket.

03:55.530 --> 03:59.240
But if I accept this job
and go against the tide,

03:59.440 --> 04:03.510
defying the entire NYPD
and defending the Brunos,

04:03.710 --> 04:05.680
I'm-- I'm just not sure
I have it in me to be

04:05.880 --> 04:09.340
the lone David going up against
that particular Goliath again.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.870
Maybe you won't have to.
Give me a second.

04:13.060 --> 04:14.950
Yeah.

04:15.150 --> 04:16.520
So you're in town?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.440
A quick in-and-out, Harold.
Just visiting a friend.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.790
Does that friend have
anything to do with our
Wujing predicament?

04:21.990 --> 04:23.010
<i>Because I've been</i>
<i>thinking we should--</i>

04:23.210 --> 04:24.830
I've got Wujing covered
for now, Harold.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.490
This has to do
with something else.

04:27.690 --> 04:30.400
The Judge Dockery murder
in New York?

04:30.600 --> 04:32.150
I know the one.

04:32.350 --> 04:34.800
Bruno's son took her out
after she sentenced
his father to life.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.850
From what I hear,
they've got him dead to rights.

04:37.050 --> 04:39.670
In my experience, things
that are <i>that</i>obvious

04:39.870 --> 04:42.680
are often obvious
for a reason.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.770
Are you saying the NYPD
got it wrong?

04:44.970 --> 04:46.250
[chuckles]

04:46.450 --> 04:49.950
Y-You remember
Herbie Hambright,
my associate,

04:50.150 --> 04:53.690
the forensics whiz
who came to your aid before?

04:53.890 --> 04:57.170
<i>He's been approached</i>
<i>by Bruno's defense team.</i>

04:57.370 --> 04:59.520
And from what
he's seen so far,

04:59.720 --> 05:03.220
he's not inclined to believe
Junior's the culprit either.

05:03.420 --> 05:05.050
And you're inclined
to believe Herbie?

05:05.250 --> 05:06.880
- I am.
<i>- We'll look into it.</i>

05:07.080 --> 05:08.920
Judge Dockery was
a venerated legal mind.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.920
All of law enforcement owes it
to her to get this right.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.930
We're wasting time
on a cut-and-dried case

05:15.130 --> 05:16.580
because of
a Reddington hunch

05:16.780 --> 05:18.410
about his pal,
a convicted mob boss?

05:18.610 --> 05:20.930
Reddington doesn't have
a dog in this fight.

05:21.130 --> 05:23.370
Herbie, the guy who helped us
run down that fingerprint from

05:23.570 --> 05:26.110
the Secret Service case,
brought it
to Reddington's attention.

05:26.310 --> 05:28.070
Herbie believes the case
isn't as cut and dried

05:28.270 --> 05:29.380
as everybody
seems to think.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.510
Look, everyone knows
that this was just payback

05:31.710 --> 05:33.640
on the one judge
who finally had the stones

05:33.840 --> 05:35.950
to put away
the legendary Paul Bruno Sr.

05:36.150 --> 05:37.910
That may be, but when
the stakes are this high

05:38.110 --> 05:40.650
is precisely when details
tend to get overlooked.

05:40.850 --> 05:42.780
Let's take a quick peek
under the hood of the case.

05:42.980 --> 05:46.350
If the facts support
Junior as the perpetrator,
no harm done.

05:46.550 --> 05:48.830
Well, the lead detective
on the Bruno case,

05:49.030 --> 05:51.960
Patrick Fleming,
also found the judge
murdered at the scene.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.360
Let's start there.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.920
Have him walk us through
the investigation.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.670
The letters B-R-U-N-O were
typed out on the keyboard.

05:59.870 --> 06:01.760
Her bloody fingerprints
on the keys.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.590
I don't know how the FBI
does it,
but where I come from,

06:04.790 --> 06:06.890
that's what we call
irrefutable evidence.

06:07.090 --> 06:08.680
Yeah, well,
we're just curious.

06:08.880 --> 06:12.060
- What? You think I'm not?
- Alice was my friend.

06:13.020 --> 06:14.600
I'm starting to wonder

06:14.800 --> 06:15.810
if I should take offense
to what you two
seem to be suggesting.

06:16.010 --> 06:17.720
Nobody's suggesting
anything here, all right?

06:19.720 --> 06:23.210
Look, Judge called me
that night,

06:23.410 --> 06:24.820
told me
to come over quick,

06:25.020 --> 06:26.610
that she just learned
something about a case.

06:26.810 --> 06:28.440
She was terrified.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.520
I never heard her
like that.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.180
Paul Bruno Jr.
had been tailing

06:32.380 --> 06:33.790
and intimidating her
for months

06:33.990 --> 06:35.790
throughout his dad's
entire trial.

06:35.990 --> 06:37.790
We have video evidence
of Junior

06:37.990 --> 06:41.450
parked outside her house,
her office, her gym.

06:41.650 --> 06:42.930
The guy's a hothead.

06:43.130 --> 06:46.240
That's obviously what
she was spooked about.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.110
Would you mind if we take
a look at your case files?

06:49.310 --> 06:50.630
Knock yourself out.

06:50.830 --> 06:53.360
You'll just come to
the same conclusion we did.

07:05.160 --> 07:10.040
Usually when somebody appears
and says they're taking me
to their boss,

07:10.240 --> 07:13.310
I assume it's someone
I screwed over.

07:13.510 --> 07:15.180
But I'm relieved to say

07:15.380 --> 07:18.660
I have absolutely no idea
who the hell <i>you</i>are.

07:18.860 --> 07:21.050
[chuckles]

07:21.250 --> 07:22.520
I am Wujing.

07:24.480 --> 07:29.240
I've long been a fan
of the legend
that is Robert Vesco.

07:29.430 --> 07:32.760
A man of great escapes
and even greater mystery.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.590
I myself recently
broke out of prison,

07:35.790 --> 07:38.030
and I imagine there's a lot
I could learn from you.

07:38.230 --> 07:40.860
Well, if you summoned me here
to give you a master class

07:41.060 --> 07:44.900
on life on the lam,
you got the wrong guy.

07:45.100 --> 07:49.730
Like they say,
those who can't do, teach.

07:49.930 --> 07:52.820
So if you don't mind, maybe
we could put the hood back on

07:53.020 --> 07:56.000
and you guys can
drop me off someplace
I can get a bite to eat.

07:56.200 --> 08:02.050
Are you aware of
Raymond Reddington's
association with the FBI?

08:02.250 --> 08:05.710
First off,
it's none of your business
what I'm aware of.

08:05.910 --> 08:08.450
And, secondly, any criminal
worth their salt

08:08.650 --> 08:13.150
cultivates relationships
with certain...
amenable authorities.

08:13.350 --> 08:16.020
Raymond Reddington
has the deepest pockets
in Christendom

08:16.220 --> 08:17.330
and the biggest reach.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.150
Of course,
he greases the wheels.

08:19.350 --> 08:21.980
[chuckles] Oh.

08:22.180 --> 08:25.120
Reddington's doing
much more than that.

08:25.320 --> 08:29.250
I would say it's less
a "friends with benefits"
arrangement

08:29.450 --> 08:32.950
than a long-term relationship
that your pal

08:33.150 --> 08:36.820
has gotten himself into
with the U.S. government.

08:37.020 --> 08:41.530
Have you heard the name
Elizabeth Keen? Hm?

08:41.720 --> 08:45.180
Of course, Reddington's
well-connected with the FBI.

08:45.380 --> 08:49.010
Hell, his former bodyman,
Dembe Zuma,
is working for them now,

08:49.210 --> 08:51.270
with a shiny gold badge
and everything!

08:51.470 --> 08:54.320
[chuckles] Mmm.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.840
Call me when you have
an actual revelation.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.200
The FBI has a top secret
Task Force

09:00.400 --> 09:02.200
sanctioned at the highest
levels of government

09:02.400 --> 09:05.680
whose sole focus is
to bring down criminals like us

09:05.880 --> 09:08.500
with the personal help
of Raymond Reddington.

09:09.410 --> 09:12.600
In fact, that very team

09:12.800 --> 09:14.980
was behind
your last arrest.

09:16.330 --> 09:18.690
And you got
this information how?

09:18.890 --> 09:20.910
From Reddington's own attorney,
Marvin Gerard,

09:21.110 --> 09:23.830
now deceased,
as you know...

09:24.030 --> 09:26.220
also thanks to
Reddington.

09:26.420 --> 09:29.830
I suppose you should
consider yourself lucky

09:30.030 --> 09:32.310
- that he only sent you
back to prison.
- Hm.

09:32.510 --> 09:34.620
Reddington <i>is</i>working
with the FBI,

09:34.820 --> 09:37.970
using all of us,
including you,

09:38.170 --> 09:40.110
as collateral he trades on,

09:40.300 --> 09:43.710
chits to play for his,
and only his, gain.

09:44.930 --> 09:47.030
Ask yourself

09:47.220 --> 09:50.280
how he's always wriggled
out of every net.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.380
And why are you
telling me this now?

09:54.580 --> 09:58.470
Because
I'm assembling a team

09:58.670 --> 10:00.600
of talented and motivated
individuals

10:00.800 --> 10:05.390
whom, like yourself,
Reddington has betrayed.

10:05.590 --> 10:09.180
A man like you would be
a true asset to the cause,

10:09.380 --> 10:14.090
one I think you will find
very rewarding.

10:21.700 --> 10:24.540
I wanted to let you know
Agent Zuma's
not coming in today,

10:24.740 --> 10:26.410
so the two of you
will be on your own.

10:26.610 --> 10:28.330
- Is he okay?
- I sent him home early
yesterday,

10:28.530 --> 10:30.370
and he's still not
feeling great this morning.

10:30.570 --> 10:32.290
Where are we on
the Dockery case?

10:32.490 --> 10:35.290
Herbie might have had
a point about the detectives
rushing to judgment,

10:35.490 --> 10:39.290
but we can't yet determine
whether any mistakes
were made in the investigation.

10:39.490 --> 10:40.910
On its face,

10:41.100 --> 10:43.730
the evidence against Bruno Jr.
looks pretty solid.

10:43.930 --> 10:47.040
Maybe someone who appeared
in her courtroom
wanted to settle a score.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.610
What about the leads
that weren't investigated?

10:50.810 --> 10:52.740
Ressler, request files
for all the cases

10:52.940 --> 10:55.090
that the Judge has presided
over the last couple of years.

10:55.290 --> 10:56.750
And, Agent Malik,
Reddington said

10:56.950 --> 10:58.880
that Herbie submitted
requests for discovery

10:59.080 --> 11:01.450
in the Judge's murder case,
but there's a backlog.

11:01.650 --> 11:03.540
That, or it's being
slow-walked to him.

11:03.740 --> 11:05.710
I'll make sure
we get everything
to Herbie ASAP.

11:05.910 --> 11:10.150
Good. Reddington seems to think
that Herbie might be able
to see things others don't.

11:10.350 --> 11:12.680
On that note,
let's play the particulars
of our relationship

11:12.880 --> 11:14.840
with Reddington
close to the vest.

11:16.890 --> 11:19.160
[horn honks]

11:19.360 --> 11:20.550
[rhythmic knocking]

11:20.750 --> 11:22.340
[Herbie] Okay, okay.

11:22.540 --> 11:23.820
[door creaks]

11:24.020 --> 11:25.460
Okay.

11:26.990 --> 11:27.990
Uh...

11:29.210 --> 11:32.040
I'm supposed to be
dropping some things

11:32.240 --> 11:36.440
for an associate
of an associate of mine.

11:36.640 --> 11:39.620
D--
Are you Herbie?

11:39.820 --> 11:41.310
Uh, yeah.

11:41.510 --> 11:43.050
Yeah, I believe
that I'm...

11:43.250 --> 11:47.480
the associate
of your associate.

11:48.310 --> 11:49.800
- But, um...
- Cute baby.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.370
Oh, thank you.
Thanks. Yeah.

11:51.570 --> 11:53.890
She's been a howler monkey
from hell this morning.

11:54.090 --> 11:55.490
Yeah, every morning.
You have kids?

11:56.800 --> 11:57.890
No.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.540
Uh, yeah. Sorry. Forgive me.
Come on in. Come in.

12:05.890 --> 12:08.430
So...how old is she?

12:08.630 --> 12:11.000
Ah, she's almost one.
Whee!

12:11.190 --> 12:14.000
[Red] Herbie,
the water pressure
in that shower

12:14.200 --> 12:15.870
could strip the hide
from an elephant.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.390
Oh, good.
You've met Siya.

12:17.590 --> 12:19.130
Siya, this is Herbie.

12:19.330 --> 12:22.180
So the F-B-freaking-I?

12:22.380 --> 12:23.920
Oh, Siya's just
a good friend.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.140
She has quite an in
with the Bureau.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.450
So, Herbie, are these materials
gonna work for you?

12:28.650 --> 12:30.060
Um. Here.

12:30.260 --> 12:31.190
I-I'm good.

12:31.390 --> 12:32.320
- Here.
- Okay.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.010
Here you go. Ah.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.580
- Yes.
- Thank you.

12:39.010 --> 12:40.590
Okay. Uh, w-what?

12:40.790 --> 12:42.770
This is literally everything
I've been asking for.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.890
How did you get your hands
on this so fast?

12:45.670 --> 12:47.950
Fast hands, I guess.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.380
Thank you
for stopping by, Siya.

12:50.580 --> 12:52.200
Tell the boss
hello for me.

12:53.460 --> 12:54.770
Will do.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.220
[door opens]

13:01.420 --> 13:03.130
Okay.
Well, have at it, Herbie.

13:03.330 --> 13:04.530
[door closes]

13:04.730 --> 13:06.660
I've got a 10 a.m. train
back to Penn Station.

13:06.860 --> 13:08.220
Okeydokey.
I'll see you later.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.880
Perhaps I could
leave this with you.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.320
Ooh. No.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.140
I was thinking you'd just
take that back to New York.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.150
Okay.

13:18.350 --> 13:22.330
No, no, no. No, no. I got her.
I got her. I got her.
I got her. Come here.

13:22.530 --> 13:23.890
[male ex-con]
I despise that judge.

13:24.090 --> 13:25.370
There wasn't a day
I didn't sit in my cell

13:25.570 --> 13:26.980
fantasizing about
all the ways

13:27.180 --> 13:28.810
I could get to her
as soon as I got out.

13:29.010 --> 13:31.680
And it just so happens
that you were released
the week she was killed.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.730
Yeah.
It's called good behavior.

13:33.930 --> 13:36.600
I went straight to Vegas
to marry my girl.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.940
Here.

13:39.990 --> 13:41.470
Ain't she pretty?

13:43.030 --> 13:44.650
[sighs]

13:44.850 --> 13:47.270
Those are time-
and date-stamped,
by the way.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.620
I got a marriage certificate,
an invoice from the Flamingo.

13:50.820 --> 13:53.010
We got up to a, uh,
lot of marital business

13:53.210 --> 13:54.790
in that hotel room,
I can promise you that.

13:54.990 --> 13:59.280
We're gonna need to see
hard copies of...all of this.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.450
Yeah, I bet you will.

14:00.650 --> 14:03.110
Judge Dockery gave me
my life back,

14:03.310 --> 14:07.150
bravely defying those
who wished to see me punished
for a crime I didn't commit.

14:07.350 --> 14:09.900
She offered me a fair trial
in what can be
a very unfair world.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.640
I was devastated
by the news of her death.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.680
- I was hoping to work with her
more in the future.
- Right.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.170
You, um, intersected
with Judge Dockery
after you were acquitted?

14:18.370 --> 14:20.210
I launched a legal
justice foundation

14:20.410 --> 14:23.000
after my acquittal
and asked Judge Dockery
to join the board.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.610
Did she accept your offer?

14:24.810 --> 14:26.700
She couldn't, for
professional ethics reasons.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.650
She was a brilliant
legal mind.

14:28.850 --> 14:31.140
It really is such
a profound tragedy.

14:31.330 --> 14:33.830
[Ressler] You lost everything
when your husband
got locked up.

14:34.030 --> 14:36.230
Houses, cars,
country-club memberships.

14:36.430 --> 14:37.840
Now, who's to blame
for that?

14:38.040 --> 14:41.930
Him. My husband's to blame,
the moron.

14:42.130 --> 14:43.280
<i>He</i>did
the insider trading.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.840
And I thought
he was watching porn

14:45.040 --> 14:46.590
all those nights
in his office.

14:46.780 --> 14:50.190
Turns out he was being naughty
in a much less interesting way.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.590
[clears throat]
Where were you on the 8th?

14:53.790 --> 14:54.990
A charity gala.

14:55.180 --> 14:57.340
It was a pity invite
from my friend Talia.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.290
She keeps saying I should
get back out there,

14:59.490 --> 15:01.820
but how can I trust a man
ever again?

15:02.020 --> 15:04.650
Call Talia.
She'll tell you I was with her.

15:04.850 --> 15:06.560
I was crying in
the Atherton Club ladies' room

15:06.760 --> 15:08.830
like it was prom night
or something.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.650
And did you blame
the judge

15:10.850 --> 15:12.390
for the loss
of your dental practice

15:12.590 --> 15:14.180
after the malpractice
conviction?

15:14.380 --> 15:15.920
[chuckles]

15:16.120 --> 15:20.490
Yeah, but, honestly,
I'm glad I got stopped.

15:20.690 --> 15:23.140
At first, it was a little
defrauding the insurers

15:23.340 --> 15:26.100
on a bill or two,
but it spun out of control.

15:26.300 --> 15:30.890
Unnecessary fillings.
Root canals.

15:31.090 --> 15:33.280
I couldn't stop myself.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.590
Getting convicted
in Judge Dockery's court

15:35.790 --> 15:37.510
changed my path
for the better.

15:37.710 --> 15:42.510
I'm on a more...
authentic journey now.

15:42.710 --> 15:44.510
And on the 8th?

15:44.710 --> 15:47.730
Oh, I-I was at
an ayahuasca ceremony

15:47.930 --> 15:49.910
led by native
Shipibo healers.

15:50.110 --> 15:52.210
An intention reset.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.690
Highly recommend.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.480
Right.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.920
- [knock on door]-Hey.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.400
That was a bust.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.580
What is that now--
11 interviews?

16:03.770 --> 16:05.490
Nobody seems to have
had it in for the Judge

16:05.690 --> 16:07.230
or even been in the area
that night.

16:07.430 --> 16:08.710
Right now
it feels like this case

16:08.910 --> 16:11.020
is exactly as it
appears to be.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.760
Occam's razor.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.890
The Judge led us directly
to her killer, Bruno Jr.

16:16.090 --> 16:17.190
[cellphone buzzes]

16:19.500 --> 16:20.590
[Malik] <i>Hello.</i>

16:20.790 --> 16:22.160
Siya.
Hey, it's Herbie.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.200
Um, you said to call
if I needed anything.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.730
Yeah, of course.
What is it?

16:25.930 --> 16:27.160
<i>I just made my way</i>
<i>through the files.</i>

16:27.360 --> 16:28.990
There is something
you gotta see.

16:29.190 --> 16:30.460
Be right there.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.990
[rhythmic knocking]

16:37.080 --> 16:38.920
[softly] Shh. I finally
got her asleep.

16:39.110 --> 16:42.220
Judge Dockery couldn't have
typed "Bruno" on her laptop.

16:42.420 --> 16:43.700
What?

16:43.900 --> 16:45.530
I said the Judge couldn't
have typed the name "Bruno"

16:45.730 --> 16:47.880
because her spinal cord
was severed.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.400
"A cold from
severe weather"?

16:50.600 --> 16:51.970
Her spinal cord
was severed.

16:52.170 --> 16:54.020
The cause of death
was strangulation,

16:54.220 --> 16:55.670
and, of course,
spinal-cord transection

16:55.870 --> 16:57.280
from a stab wound
is fairly rare,

16:57.480 --> 16:59.110
so no one would have paid
much attention to that injury.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.760
But after
getting stabbed,

17:00.960 --> 17:03.980
Dockery couldn't
have moved a finger,
much less her whole body.

17:04.180 --> 17:05.770
She would have been
paralyzed instantly.

17:05.970 --> 17:07.640
I'm still having trouble
hearing you.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.210
[loudly] So the Judge
would have been paralyzed!

17:09.410 --> 17:11.600
- [laughs]
- Oh. Ha, ha, ha.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.990
Oh, that's very funny.
Very--

17:13.190 --> 17:14.690
- [baby crying]
- Oh, God.

17:14.890 --> 17:16.650
Oh, I can't wait
till Mommy gets back

17:16.850 --> 17:18.260
to deal with
her demon spawn.

17:18.460 --> 17:20.480
Right, cutie? Yes.
Okay. Daddy's here.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.260
- All right. Okay.
- [line ringing]

17:22.460 --> 17:24.480
<i>- Cooper.</i>
- Hi. It's me.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.570
Herbie was right
to be skeptical.

17:26.770 --> 17:30.010
Turns out Judge Dockery
couldn't have typed
her killer's name.

17:30.210 --> 17:32.100
<i>It would have been</i>
<i>medically impossible.</i>

17:32.300 --> 17:35.150
So someone
intentionally put Junior
in the frame for the killing.

17:35.340 --> 17:36.580
10-4, Siya.

17:36.780 --> 17:38.890
Let's arrange a prison visit
with Bruno Sr.,

17:39.090 --> 17:40.970
see if he has any idea
who that somebody might be.

17:52.020 --> 17:54.900
Ohh. Look.
It's the Feds.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.340
This must be my birthday.

17:57.540 --> 17:58.810
Easy.
I come in peace.

18:00.070 --> 18:01.560
Here to talk
about your son.

18:01.760 --> 18:02.690
Oh, my son?

18:04.080 --> 18:06.220
The son you got locked up
for no good reason.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.090
Oh, like killing the judge
who finally put you away
for good?

18:09.290 --> 18:11.270
Junior didn't kill nobody.

18:11.470 --> 18:13.490
Not that you <i>stronzi</i>care
about the truth.

18:13.690 --> 18:15.530
Hmm, well,
that's where you're wrong.

18:15.730 --> 18:17.270
We think your son
might have been framed.

18:17.470 --> 18:20.540
Oh, you don't say.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.840
Gonna try to convince me
the Pope's Catholic next?

18:23.040 --> 18:25.020
This is what I've been
telling these people

18:25.220 --> 18:26.940
since they picked up my boy.
He's innocent!

18:27.140 --> 18:28.330
Then tell me.

18:28.530 --> 18:29.940
Who would have wanted to
set him up for this murder?

18:30.140 --> 18:31.810
I've been trying
to figure it out myself.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.110
Because once I do...

18:35.810 --> 18:37.420
What about your rivals?

18:37.620 --> 18:40.600
I made peace with
the Decanios and Tortorellas
before I went in.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.650
So nobody but your son
had motive?

18:42.850 --> 18:44.170
Look, if we were gonna
whack the Judge,

18:44.370 --> 18:45.520
don't you'd think
we would have done it

18:45.720 --> 18:47.390
before she sent us
up the river?

18:47.590 --> 18:49.000
Sure,
we kept eyes on her,

18:49.200 --> 18:50.740
but only because
people make mistakes.

18:50.940 --> 18:53.180
A lady like her
makes a mistake--

18:53.380 --> 18:56.010
scores some blow,
kicks a puppy in the belly...

18:56.210 --> 18:59.060
[chuckles]
Whatever.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.310
And maybe we got ourselves
grounds for a mistrial.

19:02.440 --> 19:03.710
Did she make a mistake?

19:03.910 --> 19:05.890
I don't know about that.

19:06.090 --> 19:07.540
She definitely
had secrets.

19:07.740 --> 19:08.840
Such as?

19:12.100 --> 19:13.980
Look, if your son
didn't do this,

19:14.180 --> 19:16.110
I need to be able
to prove it.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.510
The Judge had a lover.

19:19.710 --> 19:21.950
She was real wrapped up
when she died.

19:22.150 --> 19:23.990
My son and his crew
said they saw her

19:24.190 --> 19:27.390
go into the Sussex Hotel
a couple of times a week.

19:27.590 --> 19:30.220
Come out later
with a smile on her face.

19:30.420 --> 19:34.170
Wasn't because
of the lunch special,
if you catch my drift.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.270
[indistinct conversations]

19:41.470 --> 19:43.360
[radio chatter]

19:43.560 --> 19:46.060
We processed this scene
already-- thoroughly!

19:46.260 --> 19:48.970
Don't you guys have anything
better to do with your time
than undermine me and my team?

19:49.170 --> 19:50.320
Catch some criminals
maybe?

19:50.520 --> 19:51.890
Look, we're on
the same side here, buddy.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.020
Right, "buddy"--
the side that has Bruno Jr.

19:54.220 --> 19:55.940
in jail awaiting trial
for the murder he committed.

19:56.140 --> 19:57.850
[Malik] We believe
Judge Dockery

19:58.050 --> 20:00.420
may have been in a relationship
at the time of her death.

20:00.620 --> 20:03.210
Nope. We worked that angle.
There was no relationship.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.340
- Did you actually find
any evidence?
- Not yet.

20:05.540 --> 20:07.250
That's because
if there was anything,
we'd have found it.

20:07.450 --> 20:09.690
[Agent] Agent Ressler,
I think you should see this.

20:09.890 --> 20:11.480
I guess
you didn't find <i>that.</i>

20:11.670 --> 20:14.300
- Tell me those are
personal letters.
- Unfortunately, no.

20:14.500 --> 20:18.050
Seems like standard
work-related correspondence
and financial documents.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.600
Except for this.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.100
"You're going to pay
for what you allowed

20:28.300 --> 20:30.280
to happen
in your courtroom,

20:30.480 --> 20:33.710
letting a murderer walk free
while our Emma,

20:33.910 --> 20:36.670
with all that promise,
is all but forgotten.

20:36.870 --> 20:40.460
Her disappearance
will not go unanswered,
nor will your part in it.

20:40.660 --> 20:43.550
I will not rest until
you get what you deserve.

20:43.750 --> 20:44.990
Watch yourself."

20:45.190 --> 20:46.810
So, not a love letter,
then?

20:47.010 --> 20:49.300
He sounds like an angry guy.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.300
Signed by a Frederick Moody.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.780
Just a couple weeks
before the Judge was killed.

20:53.980 --> 20:57.390
Emma Moody.
That was one of the Judge's
cases we looked at.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.220
I spoke to the accused myself,
Anton Johnston.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.400
He was exonerated
and started a legal fund.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.570
Maybe Moody was
overwhelmed with grief

21:05.770 --> 21:07.840
and decided it was time
to punish somebody.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.840
I worked with
Judge Dockery a lot.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.410
She got threats all the time.
Par for the course.

21:12.610 --> 21:13.930
I doubt that means anything.

21:14.130 --> 21:17.280
Either way, we're gonna
pay Mr. Moody a visit.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.630
[Red] Like I said,
I don't care what it costs.

21:19.830 --> 21:21.070
[Vesco] Raymond!
Where are you?

21:21.270 --> 21:22.810
I'm in here!

21:23.010 --> 21:27.070
We need that equipment
to finish construction
on schedule.

21:27.270 --> 21:30.030
No more delays.
Am I making myself clear?

21:30.230 --> 21:31.720
Good. Thank you.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.780
I was just headed out.

21:34.980 --> 21:37.160
Uh, we need to talk.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.080
Okay.

21:42.860 --> 21:43.950
I had a meeting

21:45.040 --> 21:47.300
with a man
who calls himself Wujing.

21:49.130 --> 21:50.880
And?

21:51.080 --> 21:54.320
And he had some curious things
to say about you.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.960
Most people do.

21:57.490 --> 22:01.150
He said you were
working with the Feds.

22:01.350 --> 22:03.280
No. Wait.
It sounded more like...

22:03.480 --> 22:06.290
you were working
<i>for</i>the Feds,

22:06.490 --> 22:08.370
that you were hand-delivering
our colleagues to them

22:08.570 --> 22:12.290
like cheese puffs
on a silver platter...

22:12.490 --> 22:13.990
and that I was
one of those puffs

22:14.190 --> 22:18.300
and that you had had me
hand-delivered to prison.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.080
And what did you
have to say to that?

22:20.280 --> 22:23.000
Well, I told him
I didn't buy it.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.130
But he seemed
pretty convinced.

22:26.330 --> 22:29.000
So convinced, in fact,
that he's spending
every waking moment

22:29.200 --> 22:31.750
searching for evidence
of your supposed arrangement

22:31.950 --> 22:33.180
with the government.

22:33.380 --> 22:37.450
And when he has it,
he will come for you

22:37.650 --> 22:40.450
with the gleeful assistance
of all the criminals

22:40.650 --> 22:43.620
you've served up to the FBI
over the years.

22:45.620 --> 22:47.450
That's crazy, right?

22:50.930 --> 22:52.410
Hm. Please.

23:02.550 --> 23:05.390
Yep. I sent that letter.
So what?

23:05.590 --> 23:08.170
You wrote that Judge Dockery
was going to pay
for what she did.

23:08.370 --> 23:11.180
He didn't mean it like that.
He was just blowing off steam.

23:11.380 --> 23:12.600
You ever lose someone,
Agent?

23:13.600 --> 23:15.530
You threatened a judge.

23:15.730 --> 23:18.140
Judge Dockery didn't care
about justice.

23:18.340 --> 23:20.620
She let that spoiled
rich monster

23:20.820 --> 23:23.230
who took our daughter walk.

23:23.430 --> 23:24.710
You're referring
to Anton Johnston?

23:24.910 --> 23:27.850
Emma's hair and DNA
were found in his car.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.150
He claimed he just
gave her a ride

23:30.350 --> 23:32.760
to meet a friend at a bar,
but we know he was lying.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.240
Because Emma never
showed up at that bar.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.420
Because he did
something to her.

23:37.620 --> 23:40.290
In his testimony,
Mr. Johnston didn't deny

23:40.490 --> 23:41.640
that your daughter
was in his car.

23:41.840 --> 23:44.170
They had offices
in the same building,

23:44.370 --> 23:47.520
and he offered Emma a ride
so she didn't have to
walk in a downpour.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.480
All of which can be confirmed
by a text
she sent to her friend.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.910
So where is she then?

23:53.110 --> 23:54.700
[scoffs]

23:54.900 --> 23:58.010
You're just like every other
tool of the injustice system.

23:58.210 --> 23:59.880
"Reasonable doubt." Ha!

24:00.080 --> 24:01.400
What about common sense?

24:01.600 --> 24:04.180
She was in his car
and now she's gone!

24:05.480 --> 24:07.840
It's no wonder people
feel they're better off

24:08.040 --> 24:10.580
taking things
into their own hands.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.920
Is that what <i>you</i>did,
Mr. Moody?

24:14.880 --> 24:17.240
Where were you the night
the Judge Dockery
was murdered?

24:17.440 --> 24:18.500
He was with me.

24:18.700 --> 24:21.060
Can anyone else
verify that?

24:23.810 --> 24:25.420
[sighs]

24:25.620 --> 24:28.470
I wore this necklace
throughout the trial.

24:28.670 --> 24:30.520
Emma had an identical one.

24:30.720 --> 24:34.040
It was our thing.
A little joke between us.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.960
We bought them
at a street fair.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.700
Emma always said I should
have gotten my own name,

24:38.900 --> 24:40.700
but there wasn't a "Janice"
necklace on the rack,

24:40.900 --> 24:43.650
so I picked her name.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.830
Just like I did
when she was a baby.

24:49.220 --> 24:52.490
[crying]
Oh, God. My baby.

25:00.190 --> 25:02.030
[Frederick]
You both happy now?

25:02.230 --> 25:04.850
I'm sorry. Where did you
get that flower from?

25:06.720 --> 25:09.690
It's from a bouquet I found
on the nightstand

25:09.890 --> 25:12.300
in Emma's apartment
after she disappeared.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.300
It reminds me of when
she wasn't missing.

25:15.500 --> 25:19.780
When she was full of life,
had a huge career
ahead of her.

25:19.980 --> 25:23.050
She wanted to be
a public defender.

25:23.250 --> 25:25.620
It's ironic, isn't it?

25:25.810 --> 25:29.650
She believed in
the power of the law
to change people's lives.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.800
Weren't flowers
similar to this

25:34.000 --> 25:36.050
found at the Judge's
murder scene?

25:38.580 --> 25:40.890
Mr. Moody,
don't leave town.

25:41.090 --> 25:43.840
In the meantime, though,
we're gonna need
to borrow this.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.640
These are definitely
calla lilies.

25:48.840 --> 25:52.560
This one looks the same,
but I'm not absolutely sure.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.640
Why don't we ask Herbie
to examine it?

25:54.840 --> 25:57.250
He seems to have a wide range
of forensic expertise.

25:58.510 --> 26:00.300
Give him a call.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.000
[Malik] <i>Hello, Herbie.</i>
<i>This is Siya.</i>

26:02.200 --> 26:04.700
Hey! Siya.
This is Herbie.

26:04.900 --> 26:08.090
I know.
I just said, "Hello, Herbie."

26:08.290 --> 26:11.400
Hold on. I'm putting you
on speaker so the rest
of the team can join.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.270
Team? What team?

26:13.470 --> 26:17.620
Hello, Herbie. This is Harold.
I'm an associate of Siya's.

26:17.820 --> 26:19.930
We're here with another member
of our team, Donald.

26:20.130 --> 26:21.930
Wow. You guys are all
working the Dockery case?

26:22.130 --> 26:24.850
- We are.
- Cool. Wow.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.500
<i>Thank you for that analysis</i>
<i>of Judge Dockery's injuries.</i>

26:27.700 --> 26:28.980
There have been some other
developments in the case

26:29.180 --> 26:30.460
we'd like your expertise on
if possible.

26:30.660 --> 26:31.720
Yeah, sure thing.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.160
Um, I'm headed out
to practice right now.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.080
Finally getting a little break
from the kid.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.510
A little foosball.

26:37.710 --> 26:40.120
I'm-- [chuckles]
I'm sorry. Uh, foosball?

26:40.320 --> 26:41.650
It's something
you need to practice?

26:41.850 --> 26:43.340
<i>When you're preparing</i>
<i>for a tournament, you do.</i>

26:43.540 --> 26:45.830
So there's foosball
tournaments, huh?

26:46.030 --> 26:48.610
Yes, it's not just fraternity
parties and sports bars.

26:48.810 --> 26:50.000
You know what?
I'm getting a little tired

26:50.200 --> 26:52.140
of the constant dismissal
of the sport, quite frankly.

26:52.340 --> 26:53.700
I'd imagine you are.

26:53.900 --> 26:57.010
Anyway, Herbie, we've zeroed in
on a case Judge Dockery

26:57.210 --> 26:59.400
was presiding over a few months
before she was killed--

26:59.600 --> 27:02.670
the disappearance
and presumed murder
of Emma Moody.

27:02.870 --> 27:04.890
Emma's father,
Frederick Moody,
threatened the Judge

27:05.090 --> 27:06.980
for letting the defendant,
Anton Johnston, go free.

27:07.180 --> 27:10.110
<i>Moody's alibi</i>
<i>isn't rock-solid,</i>

27:10.310 --> 27:12.200
but, more importantly,
we found a flower

27:12.400 --> 27:15.290
in his daughter's possession
that she had
right before she disappeared.

27:15.490 --> 27:17.900
And this flower looks
very much like those

27:18.100 --> 27:19.950
that we found
at the Dockery murder scene.

27:20.150 --> 27:21.950
<i>Do you think you can confirm</i>
<i>that they're the same?</i>

27:22.150 --> 27:24.070
Can you send me a photo
of the new flower?

27:25.990 --> 27:27.650
[Malik] Okay.
Photo on the way.

27:27.850 --> 27:29.390
When we spoke
with Anton Johnston,

27:29.590 --> 27:31.570
did he mention any threats
after the acquittal?

27:31.770 --> 27:33.830
Maybe Moody also tried
to intimidate <i>him.</i>

27:34.030 --> 27:35.530
He didn't mention it.

27:35.730 --> 27:38.400
Johnston credited the Judge
with giving him his life back

27:38.600 --> 27:40.400
after being
wrongly accused.

27:40.600 --> 27:44.410
They crossed paths
at a charity event
after the trial.

27:44.610 --> 27:47.150
He seemed genuinely dismayed
by her murder,

27:47.350 --> 27:48.980
offered to help
in any way he could.

27:49.180 --> 27:50.720
Let's take him up
on that offer.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.630
[Herbie] <i>Hey, these are</i>
<i>definitely the same species</i>
<i>of lily</i>

27:52.830 --> 27:54.110
<i>as the ones</i>
<i>from the crime scene.</i>

27:54.310 --> 27:57.510
But there's more than that.
They're...weird.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.600
Siya, did you take that
photograph using a filter?

27:59.790 --> 28:02.290
- No. Why?
<i>- I mean, obviously,</i>
<i>you can get calla lilies</i>

28:02.490 --> 28:04.380
<i>from most grocery stores</i>
<i>or florists,</i>

28:04.580 --> 28:06.380
but these have, like,
a unique shimmer.

28:06.580 --> 28:08.080
It's like they were
sprayed with something

28:08.280 --> 28:10.340
or some chemical process
interfered
with their development,

28:10.540 --> 28:12.560
<i>which that would be</i>
<i>super unusual.</i>

28:12.760 --> 28:14.740
And I-- I need to run
some tests to be sure,

28:14.940 --> 28:17.130
but they definitely seem
to come from the same source.

28:17.330 --> 28:19.350
Can I physically examine
the lily from the Moodys?

28:19.550 --> 28:20.750
Not right now, of course.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.230
Oh. Because of foosball.

28:22.430 --> 28:24.180
Victory never sleeps.

28:24.380 --> 28:27.450
We'll have the specimen ready
for you after your return.

28:27.650 --> 28:30.670
[sighs] A forensics nerd
who plays competitive foosball.

28:30.870 --> 28:32.450
Who also happens to
be happily married

28:32.650 --> 28:34.630
to a super-hot
punk-rock singer.

28:34.830 --> 28:36.110
[chuckles]
Well, that confirms it.

28:36.310 --> 28:37.980
I'm definitely
doing it wrong.

28:38.180 --> 28:41.290
How about you two
drop that flower sample off
at Herbie's

28:41.490 --> 28:42.860
on your way to
Anton Johnston's residence?

28:43.060 --> 28:46.240
Maybe Moody also sent him
some poison-pen letters.

28:47.420 --> 28:49.860
[Paige] Wow! [chuckles]

28:50.060 --> 28:53.950
What a gorgeous piece
of property you have here!

28:54.150 --> 28:55.960
Again, I'm so sorry
my meeting went long

28:56.160 --> 28:58.480
and we had to
sit in traffic,

28:58.680 --> 29:02.180
but I am certain
I will find a way

29:02.380 --> 29:04.220
to make it up to you
later.

29:04.420 --> 29:06.880
[chuckles]

29:07.080 --> 29:10.350
I don't care
how we spend the time
as long as it's together.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.750
[gasps]
Oh, this is gorgeous.

29:19.140 --> 29:21.330
[gasps] Ohh.

29:21.530 --> 29:25.070
This place
really is magnificent.

29:25.270 --> 29:27.330
[Anton] Thank you.
It was my father's.

29:27.530 --> 29:30.160
I spent my formative years
at a boarding school
in New Hampshire,

29:30.360 --> 29:32.560
so I've only recently
become reacquainted

29:32.760 --> 29:34.910
with the property
since my inheritance of it.

29:35.110 --> 29:37.260
Is it strange to be
back here as an adult?

29:37.460 --> 29:38.780
It's what my father
would have wanted.

29:38.980 --> 29:40.430
And what about
your mother?

29:41.340 --> 29:42.340
Passed away, as well.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.090
Oh. I'm sorry.

29:45.290 --> 29:46.570
Don't be.

29:46.770 --> 29:48.970
She was rarely in the picture.
Very much a career type.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.660
[both chuckle nervously]

29:51.860 --> 29:54.670
Uh, what I mean is
she put her job first.

29:54.870 --> 29:57.450
My mother was
a true workaholic.

29:57.650 --> 30:00.280
It's what led
to her untimely death,
I'm certain of it.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.400
[sniffs]

30:02.800 --> 30:05.020
I'm just grateful
you managed

30:05.220 --> 30:07.800
to get some time off
to be with me now.

30:09.060 --> 30:10.240
Mm...

30:11.670 --> 30:13.550
- A toast.
- [chuckles]

30:14.290 --> 30:15.990
To...

30:16.190 --> 30:17.900
stolen moments.

30:19.770 --> 30:20.950
Mm...

30:21.150 --> 30:22.340
Mmm...

30:23.640 --> 30:25.780
[both chuckle]

30:29.080 --> 30:30.740
Mmm.

30:32.610 --> 30:34.310
Waxed leather.

30:34.510 --> 30:36.100
- Musk.
- Hm?

30:36.300 --> 30:38.090
Mushrooms.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.320
Perhaps a note
of blue cheese?

30:45.400 --> 30:46.890
I like a woman
who doesn't mind

30:47.090 --> 30:49.450
a little decay
in her single malt.

30:50.450 --> 30:53.030
This is old.
<i>Very</i>old.

30:53.230 --> 30:54.590
Seventy-five years.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.770
It's Macdonell.

30:56.970 --> 30:59.210
Ohh! [laughs]

30:59.410 --> 31:02.560
I never thought I would have
the opportunity to try some.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.130
What, at a paltry
$30,000 a bottle?

31:05.330 --> 31:08.870
Mm. To thrill you,
so it's worth <i>every</i>penny.

31:09.070 --> 31:13.790
[sighs]
What a <i>beautiful</i>garden.

31:13.990 --> 31:16.490
Do you have help with...

31:16.690 --> 31:17.960
Do you have...

31:39.540 --> 31:41.630
[doorbell rings]

31:45.160 --> 31:47.000
Oh. What a surprise.
Nice to see you again.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.780
Agent...Malik.
I believe it was?

31:48.980 --> 31:51.870
- And, uh?
- Agent Ressler.
You mind if we come in?

31:52.070 --> 31:53.960
Now's not a great time,
to be honest.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.040
We only need
a few minutes.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.150
[doors close]

32:07.350 --> 32:09.670
Somebody here with you?

32:09.870 --> 32:11.720
N-No, no.
Those are from last night.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.230
I've neglected to tidy up.
Forgive me.

32:16.060 --> 32:18.850
So...
how can I be of service?

32:19.050 --> 32:22.640
Some new evidence
has come to light regarding
the murder of Judge Dockery.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.340
About the Bruno son?

32:24.540 --> 32:26.730
We'd actually like to ask you
about the father of Emma Moody.

32:26.930 --> 32:28.780
Ah. Frederick Moody.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.340
Terrifying individual.

32:30.540 --> 32:32.040
I-I feel for him,
of course, but--

32:32.240 --> 32:34.910
- You two crossed paths?
- More than cross.

32:35.110 --> 32:37.130
It may not be noted
in trial coverage,

32:37.330 --> 32:40.480
but Moody savagely attacked me
after the not-guilty verdict.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.360
Took three bailiffs
to pull him off.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.400
He seemed to have
a serious problem
controlling his rage.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.320
Has he threatened you
since the trial?

32:47.520 --> 32:50.100
[Anton] I think there were
one or two angry letters.
I just ignored them.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.670
Wait.

32:51.870 --> 32:54.020
Do we think
he killed Ali?

32:54.220 --> 32:59.460
I didn't realize you were
on such intimate terms
with Judge Dockery.

32:59.660 --> 33:01.850
- [Anton]
Uh, w-what do you mean?
- "Ali"?

33:02.050 --> 33:05.070
Nicknames are
usually reserved for people
in one's inner circle.

33:05.270 --> 33:06.950
How close exactly
were the two of you?

33:07.150 --> 33:08.640
Hey, hey! Where's--
Where are you going?

33:08.840 --> 33:12.030
How close were you
and Judge Dockery?

33:16.030 --> 33:18.170
Okay. Fine.

33:18.370 --> 33:20.220
[sighs]

33:20.420 --> 33:21.870
For a brief time,

33:22.070 --> 33:24.960
Ali and I were...
romantically involved.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.090
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

33:29.440 --> 33:33.280
I kept quiet about it
after her death because she--

33:33.480 --> 33:35.410
She would have hated
anyone finding out.

33:35.610 --> 33:37.580
It would cast
a salacious pall

33:37.780 --> 33:39.370
over what was
a storied judgeship.

33:39.570 --> 33:41.410
A judge and
a former defendant?

33:41.610 --> 33:44.940
Protecting her reputation
was the least I could do
after all she had done for me.

33:45.140 --> 33:46.900
- [woman groans]
- [thud]

33:47.100 --> 33:49.470
- I thought you said
you were alone.
- [chuckles nervously]

33:49.670 --> 33:51.110
Go.

33:55.420 --> 33:56.520
Let's go.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.130
- [line ringing]
- [Ressler] <i>Agent Ressler.</i>

33:58.330 --> 33:59.780
Hey. It's Herbie.
Siya wasn't picking up,

33:59.980 --> 34:01.480
so I asked Red
if I could get your number.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.000
Not a good time, Herbie.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.570
Wait. I-I have information
on your flowers. The shimmer.

34:05.770 --> 34:09.090
It's unique
because the nitrogen
content is off the charts.

34:09.290 --> 34:11.440
Nitrogen alters
leaf reflectance and color,

34:11.640 --> 34:14.060
so much so that
you could spot it from
above a tree canopy

34:14.260 --> 34:16.280
<i>- if you had a drone</i>
<i>or if you had--</i>
- Still not a good ti--

34:16.480 --> 34:18.930
The really important part
is that nitrogen content

34:19.130 --> 34:21.280
that high can <i>only</i>come
from one source.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.020
One probable source
anyway.

34:23.220 --> 34:25.500
If the field tests
in the Amazon are correct--

34:25.700 --> 34:27.770
<i>- and I have no reason</i>
<i>to believe they aren't--</i>
- Cut to the chase!

34:27.960 --> 34:30.160
Decomposing bodies.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.900
W-What?

34:32.100 --> 34:33.770
<i>Vegetation with</i>
<i>this unique iridescence</i>

34:33.970 --> 34:36.950
<i>is grown on</i>
<i>or near remains--</i>

34:37.150 --> 34:38.550
<i>human remains.</i>

34:46.510 --> 34:48.610
[Anton] This, uh--
It's not what it looks like.

34:48.810 --> 34:50.790
- [Paige breathing sharply]
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Are you okay?

34:50.990 --> 34:52.440
Back against the wall!

34:52.640 --> 34:54.170
Hey...
You're okay.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.270
[Malik grunting]

35:04.270 --> 35:05.360
Ressler!

35:08.320 --> 35:10.020
Not another step.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.770
[Malik] We're digging up
the plot under that
flower garden of yours.

35:18.970 --> 35:21.430
Three women's bodies
so far.

35:21.630 --> 35:23.040
Emma Moody...

35:23.240 --> 35:25.870
a television executive
who went missing
eight months ago...

35:26.070 --> 35:29.910
and another body that appears
to be that of your mother.

35:30.110 --> 35:33.140
She was overseas frequently,
and my father wasn't exactly

35:33.330 --> 35:36.660
the "throw the ball
around the yard" type,

35:36.860 --> 35:40.750
so she decided to send me
away to boarding school,

35:40.950 --> 35:44.060
which left him alone,
abandoned,
spiraling into depression

35:44.260 --> 35:46.930
until he eventually
took his own life.

35:47.130 --> 35:48.920
And you blamed your mother
for that, didn't you?

35:50.100 --> 35:51.270
"Mother"?

35:52.710 --> 35:54.980
She doesn't merit
the honorific.

35:55.180 --> 35:56.510
She only ever cared
about herself.

35:56.710 --> 35:59.940
She didn't even come home
when my father passed.

36:00.140 --> 36:03.640
She had...
"business" in England.

36:03.840 --> 36:09.000
Business that was tall
and dark and handsome.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.130
Is that why
you killed her?

36:11.330 --> 36:14.220
Buried her body
on the property?

36:14.420 --> 36:16.610
Decomposing in that garden
was the only time

36:16.810 --> 36:19.530
that woman ever nurtured
anything.

36:19.730 --> 36:23.230
But killing your mother,
it didn't stop your pain
or your anger.

36:23.430 --> 36:27.670
So you began to target
other women
who reminded you of her,

36:27.870 --> 36:30.020
women you courted
with the very flowers

36:30.220 --> 36:32.980
you grew in your morbid
little death plot.

36:33.180 --> 36:34.720
Women like Emma Moody.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.150
And Judge Dockery.

36:36.350 --> 36:38.930
No! No.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.250
Ali was different.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.950
Different how?

36:45.150 --> 36:48.820
Ali was the first woman
who ever saw me for who I am
and loved me unconditionally,

36:49.020 --> 36:50.990
the polar opposite
of my mother.

36:53.160 --> 36:57.040
She-- She was my c-cure,
my salvation.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.250
She...

37:00.600 --> 37:02.130
She was my person.

37:04.130 --> 37:07.220
And yet...
you murdered her.

37:10.220 --> 37:12.700
I had no choice.

37:14.440 --> 37:18.240
I'm gonna rinse off and
then I'm going to make you

37:18.440 --> 37:21.980
the best shrimp scampi
you have ever had.

37:22.180 --> 37:23.500
[laughs]

37:28.070 --> 37:29.160
I love you.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.070
Mm. I love <i>you.</i>

37:32.940 --> 37:34.070
Hm.

37:35.550 --> 37:37.780
[chuckles]

37:37.980 --> 37:39.470
Ahh...

37:41.990 --> 37:43.520
[chuckles]

37:45.870 --> 37:47.260
[cellphone buzzes]

37:50.960 --> 37:52.620
This better be important.
I'm--

37:52.820 --> 37:53.970
[shower running]

37:54.170 --> 37:57.190
Oh.
It got moved up to tomorrow?

37:57.390 --> 37:59.890
Okay. Yeah. Hold on.
I just want to
write this down.

38:00.090 --> 38:02.100
Yeah, okay. I'm just--
I'm looking for a pen.

38:14.110 --> 38:17.910
I was thinking we could open
the Montrachet Grand Cru.

38:18.110 --> 38:19.470
Ali?

38:20.820 --> 38:22.030
Where'd you go?

38:40.880 --> 38:43.580
[Judge Dockery] Oh, no.
[gasps] Oh, no.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.100
At that point,
there was nothing I could say.

38:51.980 --> 38:55.950
[gasps]
Stay away from me!
Don't come any closer!

38:56.150 --> 38:58.600
You <i>were</i>in a relationship
with Emma Moody!

38:58.800 --> 39:00.860
What did you do
to that poor girl?

39:20.220 --> 39:21.620
[Anton]
Even at the end...

39:23.570 --> 39:25.240
I could see it in her eyes.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.920
She still loved me.

39:30.010 --> 39:33.100
But once you lose trust
in a relationship...

39:35.720 --> 39:37.070
...you can never get it back.

40:02.830 --> 40:04.280
[knock on door]

40:04.480 --> 40:06.580
Agent Malik is transferring
Johnston to be arraigned now.

40:06.780 --> 40:08.890
- Good work on this one.
- Herbie, too.

40:09.090 --> 40:11.670
Without his help,
we may never have found
all those bodies

40:11.870 --> 40:13.630
that Johnston creep
buried in his garden.

40:13.830 --> 40:15.940
Reddington was right about
Herbie's forensic know-how.

40:16.140 --> 40:18.640
He's a weird guy,
but he's good
at what he does.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.470
Now, speaking of Reddington,
we still don't know

40:21.670 --> 40:23.640
why the Freelancer
was broken out of prison.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.730
And Wujing--
what's up with him?

40:25.930 --> 40:28.950
He's a seriously bad guy,
and he's still out there,
by the way.

40:29.150 --> 40:30.740
Reddington says
he's got something brewing.

40:30.940 --> 40:33.350
So, for now,
we take him at his word.

40:33.550 --> 40:35.650
It's not his word
I'm worried about.

40:37.390 --> 40:39.440
[Vesco] All right.
I confronted Reddington

40:39.640 --> 40:42.530
with the information
you shared with me.

40:42.730 --> 40:46.620
And do you know what that
snake weasel reprobate did?

40:46.820 --> 40:49.150
Instead of denying it,
he actually confessed.

40:49.350 --> 40:51.930
He <i>has</i>been working
with the Feds for years.

40:52.130 --> 40:53.930
Just like you said.

40:54.130 --> 40:57.240
A secret task force
just for him.

40:57.440 --> 41:00.590
Hm. It's even named after him,
that preening egomaniac.

41:00.790 --> 41:02.200
Ahh...

41:02.400 --> 41:06.290
When I pressed him
for the truth,
the floodgates flew open.

41:06.490 --> 41:09.860
He's sitting there,
calm as Kool-Aid, saying,

41:10.060 --> 41:14.430
"Robert, my dear friend,
certainly you understand."

41:14.630 --> 41:16.870
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

41:17.070 --> 41:19.000
I said, "No, I don't."
Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.350
"No, I don't understand
at all."

41:21.550 --> 41:22.960
[sighs]

41:23.160 --> 41:24.570
And to think...

41:24.770 --> 41:27.480
I trusted that man
with my life.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.060
Well, fool me once...

41:31.260 --> 41:34.190
Betrayal is a sin
that shouldn't go unpunished.

41:34.390 --> 41:35.890
Don't you agree?

41:36.090 --> 41:38.880
As much as it pains me
to say it, yes.

41:40.620 --> 41:44.500
But it <i>doesn't</i>pain me.
It doesn't pain me at all!

41:45.280 --> 41:46.540
When do we start?

41:50.200 --> 41:52.420
[electronic music playing]
