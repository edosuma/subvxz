00:15.320 --> 00:18.640
Today, Sarah and Duck have come
to the park

00:18.640 --> 00:21.400
for a rather special surprise.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.600
You can look...now!

00:23.600 --> 00:25.760
THEY GASP

00:25.760 --> 00:28.240
Circus! Circus! Circus! Circus!

00:28.240 --> 00:31.640
# Da-da-da-la-da, da-da-da-daaa! #

00:31.640 --> 00:33.760
That's quite a moustache!

00:33.760 --> 00:35.640
Uh-huh. Oh! Whoa!

00:35.640 --> 00:37.840
Oh, oh, I know!

00:37.840 --> 00:39.880
Ha! Heh! Huh!

00:41.040 --> 00:44.640
Hey! Hey! You'll fit right in!

00:44.640 --> 00:47.080
Oh, the Ribbon Sisters!

00:47.080 --> 00:51.040
Rather exciting to see
your neighbours perform, hey?

00:51.040 --> 00:54.800
And they must be their brothers,
the Hoop Twins.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.720
Oh, yeah!
CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYS

00:56.720 --> 00:59.240
Sounds like
the show's about to start.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.160
We'd better head in.
QUACK!

01:08.720 --> 01:10.560
SARAH GASPS

01:10.560 --> 01:13.360
Ooh! Big top.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.280
Oh!

01:15.280 --> 01:17.040
Aah! Whoa! Ugh!

AUDIENCE GASP
MUSIC STOPS

01:21.000 --> 01:23.160
Oops.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.800
welcome to the circus!

01:48.040 --> 01:50.480
CHEERING

01:50.480 --> 01:53.200
APPLAUSE

01:54.320 --> 01:55.960
ALL: Hey!

01:55.960 --> 01:58.280
THEY CHEER
Woohoo!

01:58.280 --> 02:00.200
QUACK!
Woohoo!

02:02.760 --> 02:04.680
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

02:04.680 --> 02:06.720
So bendy!

02:06.720 --> 02:09.800
They're contortionists. Ooh!

02:14.600 --> 02:17.920
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

02:23.640 --> 02:25.160
CHEERING

02:55.480 --> 02:58.600
Woohoo! Bravo.
QUACK!

02:58.600 --> 03:03.320
Well, that was quite a performance.
Yeah.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.640
SARAH GASPS
Let's see it again!

03:05.640 --> 03:09.640
I don't see why not.
Yes! Yes! Again!

03:11.280 --> 03:14.600
Oh. It seems
that was their last show.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.280
ALL: Oh.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.160
And they're off
on a year-long tour.

03:19.160 --> 03:23.560
But we won't see
the Ribbon Sisters for ages!

03:23.560 --> 03:27.920
It's OK.
We can say goodbye to them tomorrow.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.240
OK. Come on, Duck.

03:31.240 --> 03:35.680
Home. Home. Home. Bedtime.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.480
BIRDS TWEET

03:37.480 --> 03:39.600
Morning, Sarah. Morning!

03:39.600 --> 03:41.120
What are you up to?

03:41.120 --> 03:44.360
Making a goodbye picture
for the Ribbon Sisters.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.880
Great idea!
QUACK!

03:45.880 --> 03:48.560
I'm sure they'll love it.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.280
Hmm, needs more colour.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.920
QUACK!

03:52.920 --> 03:54.360
Duck!

03:54.360 --> 03:59.160
Maybe you should take it easy, chap.
Those tricks take years of practice.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.320
QUACK

04:02.320 --> 04:05.600
Finished. Very good!

04:05.600 --> 04:10.960
Though we'd better hurry,
time has rather gotten away from us.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.600
Come on, Duck.
QUACK

04:12.600 --> 04:15.200
QUACK!

04:15.200 --> 04:19.040
QUACK!
DOORBELL RINGS

04:20.720 --> 04:22.240
QUACK!

04:22.240 --> 04:26.520
Hmm, perhaps they're still
at the park packing for the tour.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.320
Oh, yes!
QUACK

04:29.320 --> 04:31.680
QUACK, QUACK, QUACK!

04:34.560 --> 04:38.800
SARAH GASPS
Oh, no!

04:38.800 --> 04:42.920
It seems they've packed up
and left already. Hmm.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.600
QUACK

04:46.600 --> 04:49.280
This must be where the entrance was.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.480
Mm-hm. And we sat here.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.840
SARAH SIGHS

05:00.160 --> 05:04.840
You know, you don't always get
to say goodbye. Hmm.

05:04.840 --> 05:08.680
But that doesn't mean
they don't know they'll be missed,

05:08.680 --> 05:11.400
nor that they won't miss you.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.840
SARAH SNIFFS

05:12.840 --> 05:14.800
QUACK!

05:14.800 --> 05:16.320
QUACK, QUACK

05:16.320 --> 05:17.920
QUACK!

05:17.920 --> 05:20.160
Ha!

05:20.160 --> 05:22.000
QUACK!

05:30.440 --> 05:34.640
QUACK!
Bravo! Bravo!

05:34.640 --> 05:36.560
SARAH CLAPS

05:36.560 --> 05:39.800
How about we head home
for some lemon water?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.840
Yes. Come on, Duck.
QUACK

05:45.560 --> 05:47.920

Thank you. Alvida.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.600
Thank you! Alvida!

06:27.000 --> 06:30.800
Now, that's how you say goodbye.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.400
Yep.
QUACK

06:36.720 --> 06:40.920
Come on, Duck. Let's go home.
