WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:05.738
Good morning, Brian.

00:05.740 --> 00:08.340
- What's that?
- ALF's breakfast.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.409
I think not.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.348
What happened to you?

00:16.350 --> 00:18.484
I've got static cling.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.787
Ah, there's my other sock.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.489
Ow!

00:23.491 --> 00:26.725
Yank out all my fur,
why don't you?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.360
Sorry.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.697
What were you doing
in the laundry?

00:32.333 --> 00:33.932
The question is

00:33.934 --> 00:37.436
what is the laundry
doing in my room.

00:37.438 --> 00:40.572
However, if I had
a room of my own..

00:40.574 --> 00:42.841
Sorry, ALF, a room addition

00:42.843 --> 00:45.177
is out of the question.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.179
Fine, just remember this

00:47.181 --> 00:50.783
the next time you complain
about fur in your shorts.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.820
[theme music]

01:24.351 --> 01:27.553
[music continues]

01:53.380 --> 01:55.814
[instrumental music]

01:58.619 --> 02:00.919
Gee, these things
can do a lot more

02:00.921 --> 02:03.088
than just measure tape.

02:03.757 --> 02:04.923
Whoa!

02:04.925 --> 02:07.626
[clattering]

02:07.628 --> 02:10.095
'I just hate when this happens.'

02:11.265 --> 02:14.566
(Kate)
'ALF?'

02:14.568 --> 02:17.469
ALF? Is that, is that you?

02:17.471 --> 02:19.371
(ALF)
'Well, that depends.'

02:19.373 --> 02:21.907
'Will this involve
yelling at an alien?'

02:22.409 --> 02:23.942
Probably.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.948
- Are you alright?
- No.

02:29.950 --> 02:33.218
You guys should really
look into public storage.

02:33.220 --> 02:36.722
We already have.
They won't take you.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.691
Very nice.
Kick me while I'm hemorrhaging.

02:40.728 --> 02:43.562
ALF, what are you doing here?

02:43.564 --> 02:46.365
You remember, Kate.
My planet exploded.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.167
I crashed into your garage.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.969
- You said I could stay.
- ALF.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.839
I was measuring
for my bedroom set.

02:53.841 --> 02:58.544
Now, I'm thinking
of a Southwestern motif.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.279
Willie, pick up
a few cattle skulls

03:00.281 --> 03:01.847
on your way home tomorrow.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.649
There's a dear.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.285
ALF, we need the attic.

03:06.287 --> 03:09.087
Kate, look at this.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.455
Oh.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.690
Oh, Willie.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.625
Do these ever
bring back memories?

03:13.627 --> 03:15.861
Wait. Wait. There's more.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.597
Look.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.332
Oh!

03:20.334 --> 03:23.435
Hey! I'm impressed.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.471
When did you guys
have a Mercedes?

03:26.473 --> 03:29.474
No, ALF. This is a peace sign.

03:29.476 --> 03:30.742
What's it for?

03:30.744 --> 03:33.212
It symbolized
the goals and ideals

03:33.214 --> 03:35.314
of our country's youth.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.816
So it is from a Mercedes.

03:38.819 --> 03:42.988
Oh, I'd forgotten
all about this stuff.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.724
Why don't you just
trash all this garbage?

03:45.726 --> 03:48.227
We can't throw
these things away, this..

03:48.229 --> 03:50.696
These are a part of who we are.

03:50.698 --> 03:54.466
Or...more accurately,
who we were.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.069
Based on those pants

03:57.071 --> 03:59.605
you were some type
of outpatient.

04:01.141 --> 04:03.075
Wonder what these are.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.476
Oh, Willie!

04:04.478 --> 04:07.813
Willie, "Summer of Love."

04:07.815 --> 04:12.117
I saw that on cable!
I'm ashamed of you two.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.486
No, ALF,
it was nothing like that.

04:14.488 --> 04:17.189
These are the movies I took
at Woodstock.

04:17.191 --> 04:18.991
- Huh?
- Woodstock.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.259
It was a music festival.

04:20.261 --> 04:24.096
Three days of peace
and love and rock 'n' roll.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.098
Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin

04:26.100 --> 04:28.200
Country Joe and the Fish.

04:28.202 --> 04:30.535
You made that one up.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.371
No way, man.

04:32.373 --> 04:35.474
I think these films
are happenin'.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.076
[chuckles]
Well, uh, if it's your bag

04:38.078 --> 04:40.679
uh, let's go groove on it.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.681
What do you say, ALF?

04:42.683 --> 04:45.684
That depends.
What did you say?

04:48.022 --> 04:51.023
[instrumental music]

04:54.094 --> 04:56.161
Down in front!

04:56.163 --> 04:57.663
ALF!

04:57.665 --> 04:58.964
Come on, Kate.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.566
You won't let me go
to a real theater.

05:01.568 --> 05:04.636
At least let me create
a reasonable facsimile.

05:05.572 --> 05:08.707
Focus! Focus!

05:08.709 --> 05:13.278
Let me turn it on
before you pelt me.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.549
I'd appreciate your not using
the word pelt around me.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.585
Hi, everyone.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.322
Oh, no. Is the cable down again?

05:23.324 --> 05:26.458
Lynn, we found our movies
from Woodstock.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.493
Oh, how nice for you.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.529
I'll be in my room.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.930
You can't miss this.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.099
This is a monumental piece
of history.

05:34.101 --> 05:37.703
It's the turning point
for a whole generation.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.872
It's a bunch of naked people
dancing in the mud.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.977
Who am I to miss the turning
point for a whole generation?

05:47.948 --> 05:50.315
No talking during the film!

05:51.051 --> 05:52.584
ALF.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.356
Usher, this woman
is annoying me.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.191
[knocking on door]

05:59.193 --> 06:01.526
That would be your cue.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.962
Did you ever think
that just once

06:03.964 --> 06:06.832
I'd like to maybe
meet your friends?

06:06.834 --> 06:10.135
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanners, it's me, Trevor!'

06:10.137 --> 06:12.237
Don't ever think that.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.777
- Hi, Trevor.
- Hi, Willie.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.847
- Hi, Kate. I'm done with this.
- That you are.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.982
Oh, I always say,
"Never send a Weedwhacker

06:23.984 --> 06:26.351
to do a garden weasel's job."

06:27.221 --> 06:28.854
Isn't that the truth?

06:28.856 --> 06:31.223
Oh, your cable went down?

06:31.225 --> 06:33.959
Mom and dad are gonna show us
woodchuck movies.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.695
No, Woodstock.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.096
Woodstock?

06:38.098 --> 06:40.031
Oh, you mean that hippie thing?

06:40.033 --> 06:42.968
- I hate that.
- Hello, Willie, Kate.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.636
Come on, Trevor.
The Litwacks are waiting.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.238
Get the bridge mix,
and let's go.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.140
Oh, yeah, can we borrow
some bridge mix?

06:48.142 --> 06:51.276
We're playing cards
with somebody else besides you.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.677
Sorry, we're all out.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.680
Oh, I guess
we can't play bridge.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.617
- Got any gin?
- Oh, come on, Trevor!

06:58.619 --> 07:00.318
Alright, alright.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.991
Well, so much for the cartoon.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.727
Now could we see
our feature presentation?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.730
Brian..

07:11.732 --> 07:14.633
...the projector, please.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.835
[projector whirring]

07:21.241 --> 07:23.241
[instrumental music]

07:25.546 --> 07:29.347
(ALF)
'Hey, Brian this gives me
an idea for the wading pool.'

07:29.349 --> 07:30.882
(Kate)
'Forget it.'

07:31.985 --> 07:34.319
(Lynn)
Great camerawork, dad.

07:34.321 --> 07:37.556
- Look! That's Mama Cass.
- Mm-hmm.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.925
Short for casserole I wager.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.196
(Willie)
'There she is, kids.'

07:44.198 --> 07:46.631
(ALF)
'Who, Stevie Nicks?'

07:46.633 --> 07:49.167
(Lynn)
'Mom, tell me that isn't you.'

07:49.169 --> 07:50.802
Guilty.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.439
Wow, you were cute back then.

07:54.441 --> 07:57.275
Oh, thanks, Bri...I think.

07:58.745 --> 08:01.246
Now I see
why you married Willie.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.014
You were dizzy.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.450
No. That's why I married him.

08:05.452 --> 08:06.618
[Kate laughing]

08:06.620 --> 08:09.287
(ALF)
'Yikes! It's that girl.'

08:10.858 --> 08:12.457
'Hey, where'd you
get that shirt?'

08:12.459 --> 08:14.793
'Fredericks of Sri Lanka?'

08:15.562 --> 08:16.995
It was the '60s, ALF.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.598
Those clothes made a statement.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.834
Yeah. "I dress in the dark."

08:27.708 --> 08:30.909
[instrumental music]

08:40.621 --> 08:42.988
(Willie)
'You wanna explain this?'

08:42.990 --> 08:46.191
Shoot bullets through me.
I felt like a snack.

08:48.262 --> 08:50.195
Pass the mustard.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.770
May I help you with something?

08:58.772 --> 09:00.105
Now I know..

09:00.107 --> 09:04.276
Now I know
who you remind me of.

09:04.278 --> 09:07.479
You remind me of my
college roommate...Snout.

09:09.316 --> 09:13.184
And I thought
Melmackian parents were cruel.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.221
That was only his nickname.
His real name was Dexter.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.023
Dexter Lurch IV.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.494
Then again, Snout is nice.

09:22.496 --> 09:25.730
Snout used to go on these
marathon eating binges

09:25.732 --> 09:27.999
late at night, Oreos, Cheez Whiz

09:28.001 --> 09:30.435
anything he could
get his hands on.

09:31.438 --> 09:34.005
How does that remind you of me?

09:35.809 --> 09:37.208
Anyway..

09:37.210 --> 09:39.945
Ol' Snout is quite a character.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.647
He was, uh,
a-a kind of folk hero

09:42.649 --> 09:44.082
to a lot of the kids on campus

09:44.084 --> 09:47.152
myself included for a time.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.354
I remember he-he was
the first guy in the dorm

09:49.356 --> 09:51.156
to pierce his ear.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.892
We had a word for guys
like that on Melmac.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.065
Pirates.
What'd you think I meant?

10:01.902 --> 10:04.736
And, uh, I remember
another time he..

10:04.738 --> 10:08.039
...he took off all his clothes
and set 'em on fire.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.675
Sounds like a real party animal.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.243
No, you don't understand, ALF.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.347
We, we-we were trying
to end the war.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.616
Did it work?

10:17.618 --> 10:21.653
Well, I like to think that
maybe in a small way it did.

10:21.655 --> 10:26.257
So why doesn't anybody do any
of that peace stuff anymore?

10:26.259 --> 10:30.462
Well, for one thing
we're not at war now.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.863
Oh, right.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.299
And there's a Club Med
in Central America

10:34.301 --> 10:37.469
and the Persian Gulf
is a water theme park.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.939
Well, it's different.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.141
What happened to you?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.910
Well, when a person gets older

10:45.912 --> 10:47.912
he sees things
a little differently.

10:47.914 --> 10:51.449
He chooses his battles
a little more carefully.

10:52.386 --> 10:53.752
I get it.

10:53.754 --> 10:57.088
Turn on, tune in, sell out.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.592
I did not sell out.

11:00.594 --> 11:02.127
I have a family to support.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.997
I have an extended family,
I might add.

11:06.733 --> 11:09.367
Ooh. Good one, Willie.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.871
Oh, you don't understand.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.539
What's to understand?

11:14.541 --> 11:16.508
You cut your hair, got a job

11:16.510 --> 11:18.043
and you won't let me live
in the attic.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.711
Forget the attic.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.313
The attic is out.

11:22.315 --> 11:26.651
Why? You need the storage space
for your abandoned idealism?

11:29.723 --> 11:32.090
Goodnight, ALF.

11:33.760 --> 11:37.996
Boy, point out one major flaw
in someone's belief system

11:37.998 --> 11:40.198
they take it personally.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.007
[instrumental music]

11:55.949 --> 11:58.049
I can't sleep.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.985
Maybe all the pacing
is keeping you up.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.321
I can't help thinking
maybe ALF is right.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.990
Willie, check your temperature.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.325
I mean it, Kate.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.828
I used to organize peace marches

12:09.830 --> 12:11.863
now I organize coupons.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.298
It's a big help, honey.

12:13.300 --> 12:17.068
Oh, thank you, but..
What am I saying?

12:17.070 --> 12:20.171
Willie, you can't let ALF
get to you like this.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.474
Oh, it's not just ALF.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.379
Although he does
figure prominently.

12:28.381 --> 12:32.083
I come with a peace offering.
You want a flower?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.552
- No.
- Good.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.792
[burps]

12:40.794 --> 12:43.328
I came to say I'm sorry.

12:43.330 --> 12:46.731
Apology accepted. Goodnight.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.934
I realized you had no choice
but to sell out.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.437
The system is bigger
than you are.

12:53.774 --> 12:57.842
Well, we're both
bigger than you, so leave.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.611
Whoa, man!

12:59.613 --> 13:02.313
Bad vibrations!

13:02.315 --> 13:03.648
Whew!

13:07.287 --> 13:10.421
- So now can you sleep?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Uh-huh.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.928
[breathing heavily]

13:16.930 --> 13:20.131
[instrumental music]

13:28.208 --> 13:31.042
Ah, come on, Willie.
I want you to meet my friends.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.511
Oh, gosh, I'd love to, Kate,
but I don't have time.

13:33.513 --> 13:37.081
I got to finish registering and
I-I got to get my campus map.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.451
[laughing]
You're a trip.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.821
- Well, thank you.
- Listen, you get us a table.

13:42.823 --> 13:46.224
- I'll be right back, okay?
- A table? Sure. Sure thing.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.128
Hey, peace!
Welcome to Big Daddy's.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.797
I'm Big Daddy.
All you need is love.

13:52.799 --> 13:55.166
There's a two-drink minimum.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.634
I'm Willie Tanner.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.103
Uh, I'm delighted
to make your scene.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.706
This is my old lady
Judy Blue Eyes.

14:02.776 --> 14:06.110
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Eyes.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.313
To everything,
there is a season.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.714
Did you mention
the two-drink minimum?

14:09.716 --> 14:10.982
- It's handled.
- Ah!

14:10.984 --> 14:12.483
Our hangout is your hangout.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.252
We just want you
to feel welcome.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.688
- Please make yourself at home.
- Well, thank you, uh..

14:16.690 --> 14:19.757
[sneezing]
Thank you very much. I think
I'll-I'll just sit over here.

14:19.759 --> 14:22.961
- Get out of that booth!
- Get out of that booth!

14:22.963 --> 14:24.629
Oh, no, no, no.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.799
- Not Snout's booth, Willie.
- Who's Snout?

14:27.801 --> 14:30.435
[laughing]
He's new here.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.371
- No.
- No.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.340
Say, Kate, this Snout person..

14:35.342 --> 14:37.909
Oh, yeah, yeah, like, um..

14:37.911 --> 14:41.179
Snout's like...our guru.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.181
- I beg your pardon?
- Our guru, you know.

14:43.183 --> 14:46.184
Like, um...oh,
like the<i> maharishi</i>

14:46.186 --> 14:48.653
like...a man of peace.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.588
Well, then why can't I
sit in his booth?

14:50.590 --> 14:53.124
Because he'll punch
your lights out.

14:55.262 --> 15:00.164
Peace! Love!
Right on! Your mother!

15:00.166 --> 15:02.100
Hey, Snout!

15:02.102 --> 15:04.836
Kate, my child, my flower.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.804
My flower child.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.842
Who's the nerd?

15:10.844 --> 15:15.013
Oh, Snout, that's Willie.
He's new here.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.081
There's a bulletin.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.516
So, bro, where you from?

15:18.518 --> 15:21.085
Oh, you know, I've been around.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.887
Here, there.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.690
Decatur, Illinois.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.293
And, you know, it shows.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.361
Kate, we missed you
at the sit-in.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.930
You don't actually do that.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.532
- Do you?
- Do what?

15:34.534 --> 15:37.602
Sit in someone's office
until they make you leave.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.137
And interfere with
other people's right

15:39.139 --> 15:41.139
to get an education.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.541
Hey, man, for your information

15:43.543 --> 15:47.045
we're trying to educate people
to the way that the system

15:47.047 --> 15:49.547
exploits those
who aren't in power.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.716
- Alright!
- Yeah!

15:51.718 --> 15:53.351
People who really
wanna change history

15:53.353 --> 15:54.919
don't do it by sitting around.

15:54.921 --> 15:57.889
They go out and work
for what they believe.

16:02.896 --> 16:06.965
You can't rebuild
without tearing down first.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.601
That's ridiculous, you have
to work within the system.

16:10.603 --> 16:13.938
Don't you have an Up With People
rehearsal to go to?

16:15.141 --> 16:16.841
No, but I do have to go.

16:16.843 --> 16:19.777
- Oh, Willie, be cool.
- No, it's alright, Kate.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.779
I have to meet
my roommate anyway.

16:21.781 --> 16:25.683
Does anyone know where
I can find Dexter Lurch IV?

16:29.889 --> 16:32.190
Hey, right here, roomie.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.859
Oh, by the way, I shed.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.431
Roommate...shedding..

16:40.433 --> 16:42.600
...up with people..

16:42.602 --> 16:46.204
Turn off the lava lamp,
I can't sleep.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.010
So what're the specials today?

16:52.012 --> 16:54.379
Egg salad,
tuna salad, brisket.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.447
Heavenly<i> ambrosia, </i>
celestial<i> ambrosia</i>

16:56.449 --> 16:59.217
and beef<i> ambrosia. </i>
What's for dessert?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.285
Chicago seven-layer cake.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.058
- Hey, Big Daddy.
- Hey, Moon Shadow.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.260
[chuckles]

17:10.196 --> 17:12.563
So how'd you do
on your finals, kid?

17:12.565 --> 17:15.033
I like to think that grades
aren't all that important

17:15.035 --> 17:17.301
in the grand scheme of things.

17:17.303 --> 17:20.438
- You graduated.
- With honors.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.340
Don't tell Snout.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.109
You know, I agree with you
on this grades business.

17:25.111 --> 17:28.513
I never got better than a D
on anything and look at me now.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.885
We've both come a long way.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.521
But you know,
I realized something today.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.489
I didn't come to college
for the diploma.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.091
I thought I did, but now I know

17:40.093 --> 17:41.993
it's really much,
much more than that.

17:41.995 --> 17:43.728
I know, chicks.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.230
Yeah, chicks are nice,
but I'm talking about

17:46.232 --> 17:48.699
a whole new perspective.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.636
I-I realized something,
that these past four years

17:51.638 --> 17:54.939
have really opened my eyes.

17:54.941 --> 17:57.375
I know now my life's work
is to make this place

17:57.377 --> 17:59.777
called Earth a better planet.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.547
- You sound like Snout.
- I know.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.048
I owe him a lot, Daddy.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.317
He's taught me
there's much more to life

18:06.319 --> 18:08.553
than turning a fast buck.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.856
Peace. Don't get up.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.827
What's with the hat?
You graduating?

18:15.829 --> 18:18.796
Yeah, this place
is like the White House.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.666
After eight years,
they make you leave.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.838
I'm gonna miss you, roomie.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.573
Where you gonna go?

18:28.575 --> 18:30.441
To work, where else?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.710
Oh, you got a job? That's great.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.113
Where's it gonna be? ACLU?

18:35.115 --> 18:37.315
Uh, peace corps?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.485
You're looking
at the new partner

18:40.487 --> 18:44.088
in the brokerage house
of Heinz, Heinz, and my dad.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.058
Guess which one hired me.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.827
I can't believe it.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.130
What about your plans
to help the poor?

18:52.132 --> 18:54.065
The-the disenfranchised?

18:54.067 --> 18:56.734
W-w-what about your ideals?

18:56.736 --> 19:00.838
This isn't college.
This is life.

19:00.840 --> 19:05.076
How can you just walk away
from everything you believe in?

19:05.078 --> 19:06.544
Who's walking?

19:06.546 --> 19:08.980
I'll be driving my new Mercedes.

19:08.982 --> 19:12.383
Oh, what do you think,
burgundy with a tan interior?

19:13.286 --> 19:16.554
Snout! You're selling out!

19:16.556 --> 19:19.423
Hey, lighten up, man.

19:19.425 --> 19:22.326
In a year,
you'll be calling me for a job.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.128
Here's my card.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.130
See you later, agitator.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.601
Not in a year.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.737
Not in a hundred years.

19:32.739 --> 19:35.573
I'm not gonna be a slave
to the almighty dollar.

19:35.575 --> 19:39.076
I'm keeping my ideals.
I'm not selling out!

19:39.946 --> 19:41.546
I'm not selling out.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.549
I'm not. Yoko, tell them!

19:46.286 --> 19:47.652
Did not sell out.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.654
Of course, you didn't, dear.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.856
Now go back to sleep.

19:54.494 --> 19:57.395
There's something I have
to take care of first.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.536
Yoko?

20:08.041 --> 20:11.676
¶ I'm gonna lay down
my fork and spoon ¶

20:11.678 --> 20:14.545
¶ Down by the dinner plate ¶

20:14.547 --> 20:16.948
¶ Down by the dinner plate ¶

20:16.950 --> 20:18.583
¶ Down by the dinner plate ¶

20:18.585 --> 20:21.852
¶ I'm gonna lay down
my fork and spoon ¶

20:21.854 --> 20:23.688
¶ Down by the dinner plate ¶

20:23.690 --> 20:27.625
¶ And eat this with my hands ¶¶

20:30.530 --> 20:32.730
[ALF chomping]

20:34.400 --> 20:36.400
- Are you eating again?
- No.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.469
[burps]
Still.

20:41.808 --> 20:44.442
I wanna talk to you
about something.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.378
You were just
in a dream of mine.

20:47.380 --> 20:50.648
In this dream,
did I have my own room?

20:50.650 --> 20:54.385
No, actually,
you shared a room with me.

20:54.387 --> 20:57.088
Fine! We'll give Kate the attic.

20:58.591 --> 21:02.460
No, ALF,
we'll give you the attic.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.863
- Really?
- Really.

21:05.865 --> 21:09.533
I think I can get rid of some
of that stuff I got up there.

21:09.535 --> 21:12.536
You said that stuff
was part of you.

21:12.538 --> 21:16.974
Well, I thought I needed it,
but as it turns out...I don't.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.976
I still have..

21:18.978 --> 21:22.146
...all the important things
I got from the '60s.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.749
You do?

21:25.752 --> 21:29.320
I may not be out
marching on Washington..

21:29.322 --> 21:33.224
...but I'm a social worker.
I still help people.

21:33.226 --> 21:34.992
One at a time.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.862
I realized that's the way
I can do the most good.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.565
And you get a sack lunch.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.969
It's a good life.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.671
Cookie?

21:46.673 --> 21:48.606
I can dig it.

21:54.047 --> 21:56.514
[instrumental music]

21:58.017 --> 22:00.985
Where's ALF? It's not like him
to miss a meal.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.521
He's up in his new room
listening to an album.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.523
I think it's The Doors again.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.559
He said he'd be down
in a minute.

22:08.561 --> 22:11.295
Don't you guys miss
the good old days?

22:11.297 --> 22:13.831
Mm-mm. Not for a minute.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.802
I think I do...a little.

22:17.804 --> 22:20.004
But as much as I loved the '60s

22:20.006 --> 22:22.673
that's probably
the last decade

22:22.675 --> 22:24.742
I'd ever want to return to.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.577
[peppy music]

22:26.579 --> 22:30.214
Alright, Tanners.
Get down and boogie.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.154
I'd like to qualify
my last remark.

22:42.495 --> 22:45.696
[theme music]

23:09.455 --> 23:11.655
[ALF laughing]
