18:04.049 --> 18:07.289
I've been like a nervous

18:04.049 --> 18:07.289
wreck since 7:00 this morning.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.140
I was going to leave

18:08.000 --> 18:10.140
this morning.

18:10.150 --> 18:12.000
Seriously.

18:13.119 --> 18:14.200
This helps me.

18:14.210 --> 18:17.119
[light music]

18:17.130 --> 18:19.210
Because I feel

18:17.130 --> 18:19.210
so uncomfortable.

18:21.009 --> 18:24.109
And I'm leaving

18:21.009 --> 18:24.109
my forever house,

18:24.119 --> 18:26.170
which I complete--see--

18:30.049 --> 18:31.210
Until I got to Tahoe,

18:31.220 --> 18:34.000
I don't think I understood

18:31.220 --> 18:34.000
the emotional ties

18:34.009 --> 18:36.039
that I had selling my house.

18:36.049 --> 18:40.039
Roll...and tuck.

18:40.049 --> 18:41.190
- You're putting our movers

18:40.049 --> 18:41.190
to shame.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.059
- You can't say that

18:41.200 --> 18:44.059
I didn't pack anything.

18:44.069 --> 18:45.109
All right. Let's go.

18:44.069 --> 18:45.109
- Ready?

18:45.119 --> 18:47.180
- Ah. Take good care.

18:47.190 --> 18:49.029
Don't break anything.

18:49.039 --> 18:50.210
[laughter]

18:49.039 --> 18:50.210
This is gonna be fun.

19:00.150 --> 19:03.150
Sorry. I don't know

19:00.150 --> 19:03.150
if that's--

19:03.160 --> 19:06.019
if I've actually

19:03.160 --> 19:06.019
really, really--

19:06.029 --> 19:08.099
I did, at first,

19:06.029 --> 19:08.099
I thought I was okay,

19:08.109 --> 19:09.200
and I guess I'm just

19:08.109 --> 19:09.200
not still.

19:09.210 --> 19:12.160
I think leaving the house

19:12.170 --> 19:15.059
was harder

19:12.170 --> 19:15.059
than I was pretending it to be.

19:15.069 --> 19:18.150
So, I do apologize

19:18.160 --> 19:21.000
if--if I projected that.

19:24.049 --> 19:28.150
- Moving out of your home

19:24.049 --> 19:28.150
is not an excuse

19:28.160 --> 19:33.099
to attack

19:28.160 --> 19:33.099
and act like a crazy person.

19:33.109 --> 19:36.049
- And so I do apologize

19:33.109 --> 19:36.049
that you got thrown

19:36.059 --> 19:39.069
in the mix of my craziness,

19:36.059 --> 19:39.069
we'll call it.

19:41.059 --> 19:43.069
- I'm happy to move forward.

19:43.079 --> 19:44.180
Um...

19:43.079 --> 19:44.180
- I mean, look,

19:44.190 --> 19:46.160
we can take baby steps.

19:46.170 --> 19:49.140
- Yeah. I might have to.

19:49.150 --> 19:52.160
Let me go down and just enjoy

19:49.150 --> 19:52.160
the rest of the day.

19:52.170 --> 19:54.000
- Yeah, I mean--

19:52.170 --> 19:54.000
- We have a beautiful,

19:54.009 --> 19:55.170
I think, dinner ahead of us.

19:55.180 --> 19:57.089
It'll be good.

19:55.180 --> 19:57.089
- Yeah.

19:57.099 --> 19:59.230
Maybe Tahoe's not our place.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.009
- [small laugh]

19:59.240 --> 20:02.009
All right. Let's go down.

20:03.049 --> 20:05.190
- And I like your coat.

20:03.049 --> 20:05.190
- Thank you so much.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.240
- My God, you guys.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.240
- This is stunning.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.099
- This is so beautiful.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.099
- Wow.

20:08.109 --> 20:09.170
- So peaceful.

20:09.180 --> 20:11.130
- I can't believe

20:09.180 --> 20:11.130
we're, like, here.

20:11.140 --> 20:12.240
- Oh wow.

20:11.140 --> 20:12.240
- Look at this house.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.170
- Is this the "Godfather"

20:12.250 --> 20:14.170
house?

20:14.180 --> 20:15.170
- No.

20:15.180 --> 20:16.180
- Is it?

20:15.180 --> 20:16.180
- What is it?

20:16.190 --> 20:19.079
- They do tours in there right?

20:16.190 --> 20:19.079
- What is it?

20:23.180 --> 20:24.220
- No, she bought...

20:23.180 --> 20:24.220
- Wow.

20:24.230 --> 20:26.099
- The whole bay?

20:28.170 --> 20:30.190
- No!

20:28.170 --> 20:30.190
- Why didn't we stay here?

20:30.200 --> 20:32.099
- I think with that history

20:30.200 --> 20:32.099
that's really great.

20:32.109 --> 20:33.170
It makes it

20:32.109 --> 20:33.170
even more special.

20:33.180 --> 20:37.029
- In 1929,

20:33.180 --> 20:37.029
a woman owned this bay.

20:37.039 --> 20:39.029
- How about that?

20:39.039 --> 20:40.200
- Hi, guys.

20:39.039 --> 20:40.200
- How are you doing, honey?

20:40.210 --> 20:42.069
- Hey.

20:40.210 --> 20:42.069
- Hi.

20:42.079 --> 20:44.039
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.200
- We're parking.

20:48.210 --> 20:51.079
- Parking, and momma

20:48.210 --> 20:51.079
needs to get home.

20:51.089 --> 20:54.059
- This was really beautiful.

20:51.089 --> 20:54.059
That was refreshing.

20:54.069 --> 20:56.160
- Have a great afternoon.

20:54.069 --> 20:56.160
- Refreshing.

21:02.079 --> 21:04.039
- Thank you, honey.

21:02.079 --> 21:04.039
Beautiful day.

21:04.049 --> 21:05.160
- Oh, you're so welcome.

21:05.170 --> 21:08.029
- It was relaxing.

21:05.170 --> 21:08.029
- I'm so glad you liked it.

21:08.039 --> 21:09.220
- Oh my God,

21:08.039 --> 21:09.220
that smells so good.

21:09.230 --> 21:11.079
- I smell cookies.

21:11.089 --> 21:14.130
- Okay. Oh my God.

21:11.089 --> 21:14.130
- Donuts? Did she make donuts?

21:14.140 --> 21:16.190
- Holy macaroni.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.259
- Uh-uh.

21:17.269 --> 21:19.180
- Wow.

21:17.269 --> 21:19.180
- These are divine.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.039
- Uh-huh.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.039
- Not just good.

21:21.049 --> 21:22.089
- Uh-uh.

21:21.049 --> 21:22.089
- No, she's amazing.

21:22.099 --> 21:24.089
- Divine.

21:22.099 --> 21:24.089
- God bless the chef.

21:24.099 --> 21:25.250
- Okay, I'm gonna go

21:24.099 --> 21:25.250
take a little break.

21:25.259 --> 21:27.109
- Murdered that.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.190
- we're gonna meet back around

21:27.119 --> 21:29.190
7:00 for dinner.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.250
- Erika, I expect you up

21:29.200 --> 21:31.250
a little later tonight.

21:31.259 --> 21:33.130
- We'll be up

21:31.259 --> 21:33.130
a little later tonight.

21:33.140 --> 21:35.150
Not too late,

21:33.140 --> 21:35.150
but a little later.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.180
- It's our last night.

21:36.190 --> 21:38.119
- Okay, bye.

21:36.190 --> 21:38.119
- See you at 7:00.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.230
- See you soon.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.190
- Look how pretty this is.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.269
Can't believe we haven't

21:42.200 --> 21:44.269
come out here yet.

21:44.279 --> 21:48.109
What's that?

21:44.279 --> 21:48.109
Oh, I've seen this in movies.

21:48.119 --> 21:50.259
Oh. We throw this.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.259
- Okay. You've very good

21:52.160 --> 21:54.259
with small balls.

21:55.230 --> 21:58.059
We have to see

21:55.230 --> 21:58.059
who gets closest to that ball.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.170
- Sh--.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.170
- Okay.

22:01.180 --> 22:02.259
Come on, baby.

22:05.279 --> 22:07.069
Pretty good.

22:14.109 --> 22:15.259
- Oh, sh--.

22:15.269 --> 22:17.160
I gotta put my scarf down.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.059
This is not working.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.059
- Okay, last one.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.059
Oh, look.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.059
- Oh my God.

22:23.069 --> 22:24.259
- I mean, come on.

22:23.069 --> 22:24.259
- Jesus.

22:24.269 --> 22:26.160
- I've got a competitive

22:24.269 --> 22:26.160
nature,

22:26.170 --> 22:28.210
and it feels good to win.

22:28.220 --> 22:31.180
I mean, it's not like it

22:28.220 --> 22:31.180
happens all the time.

22:31.190 --> 22:36.099
- Dorit's, like, moving.

22:31.190 --> 22:36.099
- You did it! Whoo!

22:42.000 --> 22:43.269
- Hey!

22:43.279 --> 22:45.200
- Go! Go! Go, go!

22:43.279 --> 22:45.200
- Come on!

22:45.210 --> 22:47.180
- Pedal to the metal.

22:47.190 --> 22:48.250
- How the heck does Dorit,

22:48.259 --> 22:49.289
who doesn't work out,

22:48.259 --> 22:49.289
get ahead of us?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.250
- Winner!

22:51.259 --> 22:53.160
First time

22:51.259 --> 22:53.160
ever playing bocce ball.

22:53.170 --> 22:55.250
- Sh--.

22:53.170 --> 22:55.250
You know what, whatever.

22:55.259 --> 22:57.170
[groans]

23:09.230 --> 23:12.220
- Hi, darling. It's only me.

23:12.230 --> 23:14.210
Hi. Welcome.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.259
- Thank you.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.259
What are you drinking?

23:16.269 --> 23:19.250
- I just poured myself a vodka.

23:19.259 --> 23:22.180
- Oh. Okay.

23:19.259 --> 23:22.180
- Cheers.

23:22.190 --> 23:25.109
- Our last night here.

23:22.190 --> 23:25.109
- Oh, thank--yes.

23:25.119 --> 23:27.170
I almost said "thank God."

23:27.180 --> 23:31.180
- You're wearing those shoes?

23:27.180 --> 23:31.180
This is amazing. Oh my God.

23:31.190 --> 23:33.000
- Well, it's a little bit much.

23:33.009 --> 23:34.099
But I'm good.

23:33.009 --> 23:34.099
- It's amazing. I love them.

23:34.109 --> 23:35.119
- You look great.

23:34.109 --> 23:35.119
- I do?

23:35.130 --> 23:37.240
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

23:35.130 --> 23:37.240
You got to zip me.

23:37.250 --> 23:40.130
- Okay. Okay.

23:37.250 --> 23:40.130
- You gotta zipper.

23:40.140 --> 23:41.230
Now, it might be

23:40.140 --> 23:41.230
a little tricky.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.109
- No, I'm gonna take--

23:41.240 --> 23:43.109
- Hang on.

23:43.119 --> 23:45.000
I feel like I need to put

23:43.119 --> 23:45.000
the boobs right.

23:45.009 --> 23:46.289
Now go.

23:45.009 --> 23:46.289
Oh no.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.250
Oh, ugh!

23:48.259 --> 23:50.099
Praise Jesus, it zipped.

23:50.109 --> 23:52.170
- Where is everybody?

23:52.180 --> 23:53.269
Dorit.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.009
- There she is.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.009
- Hello.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.119
- Oh, pretty.

23:59.130 --> 24:00.230
- She thought she'd butter

23:59.130 --> 24:00.230
us up

24:00.240 --> 24:02.170
with the teddy bear slippers.

24:02.180 --> 24:04.109
- Oh, look!

24:02.180 --> 24:04.109
[chatter]

24:04.119 --> 24:05.130
- That is so cute.

24:05.140 --> 24:07.140
- This is how I like you

24:05.140 --> 24:07.140
to look--you look amazing.

24:07.150 --> 24:08.200
- You like me to look

24:07.150 --> 24:08.200
like this?

24:08.210 --> 24:10.190
- Yeah.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.240
- Hey, Kyle.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.240
- Oh, hi, Kyle Richards.

24:13.250 --> 24:16.009
- Hi, guys.

24:13.250 --> 24:16.009
- ♪ I love your leather pants ♪

24:16.019 --> 24:17.289
- Hi.

24:16.019 --> 24:17.289
- ♪ I love your leather pants ♪

24:18.000 --> 24:19.289
- I don't know why you

24:18.000 --> 24:19.289
brought your purse.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.009
- I feel like it kind of--

24:20.000 --> 24:22.009
the thing is,

24:22.019 --> 24:23.170
it's, like, part of my outfit.

24:23.180 --> 24:24.230
- Yes.

24:23.180 --> 24:24.230
- You know?

24:24.240 --> 24:26.109
And I've got my little

24:24.240 --> 24:26.109
lipstick in it.

24:26.119 --> 24:27.170

- Oh.

24:27.180 --> 24:30.150
- Welcome to our party.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.269
- Those boots are great.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.269
This whole outfit's great.

24:32.279 --> 24:34.000
- Honey, I just want

24:32.279 --> 24:34.000
to let you know,

24:34.009 --> 24:35.150
did you know that

24:34.009 --> 24:35.150
they're not--are

24:35.160 --> 24:36.150
they supposed to be unbuttoned

24:35.160 --> 24:36.150

24:36.160 --> 24:37.210
- Yes.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.210
- Uh-huh.

24:37.220 --> 24:39.019
- Oh.

24:37.220 --> 24:39.019
- Uh-huh.

24:39.029 --> 24:41.210
- Easy access.

24:39.029 --> 24:41.210
- Oh, pull it over a little.

24:41.220 --> 24:43.250
- Work it, girl.

24:41.220 --> 24:43.250
- Style it, Kathy.

24:43.259 --> 24:45.109
- Take them off. Take them off.

honest, and then some.

31:24.029 --> 31:25.079
- All right. I get it.

31:25.089 --> 31:28.109
But Garcelle,

31:25.089 --> 31:28.109
I was trying to reach her,

31:28.119 --> 31:31.269
and I did not do it

31:28.119 --> 31:31.269
the right way.

31:31.279 --> 31:34.279
I was trying to reach her.

31:31.279 --> 31:34.279
- We can agree on that.

31:34.289 --> 31:37.150
[tense music]

31:37.160 --> 31:41.019
- I'm always willing to take

31:37.160 --> 31:41.019
a look when I (BLEEP) up.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.000
I did the wrong thing.

31:43.009 --> 31:44.240
I just wanted her to be

31:43.009 --> 31:44.240
transparent and vulnerable.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.049
And guess what?

31:46.059 --> 31:48.019
- She didn't want to.

31:46.059 --> 31:48.019
- She didn't want to,

31:48.029 --> 31:50.029
or was she ready?

31:48.029 --> 31:50.029
- Right.

31:50.039 --> 31:52.119
- It's much more valuable

31:50.039 --> 31:52.119
if I can say,

31:52.130 --> 31:53.160
"I don't like

31:52.130 --> 31:53.160
how I behaved there.

31:53.170 --> 31:56.089
I'm not proud of that.

31:53.170 --> 31:56.089
Let's see if I can be better."

31:56.099 --> 31:58.170
But I think that's where

31:56.099 --> 31:58.170
it went south for me.

31:58.180 --> 32:00.150
- Pushing it and pushing it

31:58.180 --> 32:00.150
and pushing

32:00.160 --> 32:02.029
when you could have

32:00.160 --> 32:02.029
been like,

32:02.039 --> 32:03.049
"You know what..."

32:02.039 --> 32:03.049
- You know what?

32:03.059 --> 32:05.079
- "If you don't want to say it,

32:03.059 --> 32:05.079
that's your bad.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.230
That's whatever."

32:05.089 --> 32:06.230
- And guess what.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.039
That's what

32:06.240 --> 32:08.039
I should have done.

32:08.049 --> 32:09.140
- Right. Yeah.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.009
- Coming up:

32:15.019 --> 32:18.019
- Guys, come in!

all: No!

- Come on, you pussies.

32:19.269 --> 32:22.250
- This is when you go, "Okay."

32:29.019 --> 32:29.230
- Let's go get a drink

32:29.140 --> 32:29.230
and go downstairs.

32:32.069 --> 32:34.009
- Come on.

32:32.069 --> 32:34.009
- Okay.

32:34.019 --> 32:35.029
- I am just thrilled

32:34.019 --> 32:35.029
with this get-up.

32:35.039 --> 32:36.119
- I love this.

32:35.039 --> 32:36.119
- I know.

32:36.130 --> 32:39.140
- Okay. Let's follow

- She rallied.

32:42.049 --> 32:44.240
- Hello.

32:52.009 --> 32:54.039
- Thin.

32:52.009 --> 32:54.039
- I'm working on it.

32:54.049 --> 32:56.069
Smoke and mirrors, girl.

32:56.079 --> 32:58.259
- The whole ----ing life

32:56.079 --> 32:58.259
is smoke and mirrors.

32:58.269 --> 33:02.039
Nothing is what

32:58.269 --> 33:02.039
it seems in life.

33:02.049 --> 33:05.170
Nothing. And you don't know

33:02.049 --> 33:05.170
everything about anyone.

33:05.180 --> 33:08.039
That's really the truth.

- Aah!

33:37.079 --> 33:40.140
- As well, (BLEEP).

33:37.079 --> 33:40.140
- I'm going to the pool now.

33:40.150 --> 33:43.099
And it's sad that I have to go

33:40.150 --> 33:43.099
by myself, but I'm gonna do it.

33:43.109 --> 33:48.029
- Whoo! Yes! Yes!

Come in!

- What?

34:01.089 --> 34:02.130
all: No.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.170
- Girl, I'm wearing

34:02.140 --> 34:04.170
a velvet jumpsuit.

my bathing suit on,

34:13.110 --> 34:15.070
But it sounds so daunting.

34:15.079 --> 34:16.119
- Girl, you said you bought

34:15.079 --> 34:16.119
four of them.

34:16.130 --> 34:17.269
- I mean, you brought

34:16.130 --> 34:17.269
your bathing suit.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.150
- She brought four of them.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.150
- Sutton's coming!

- Sutton, come!

- Can I make a point.

- Yes.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.119

34:48.130 --> 34:51.170
push people and push people.

Sometimes you gotta go,

Wow.

That's harder than I thought.

- That's very impressive.

35:59.090 --> 36:03.230
as difficult as it actually is.

36:03.239 --> 36:06.139
All hail Esther Williams.

I bow down.

36:08.139 --> 36:09.230
- Great job. Great job.

- Why?

36:20.150 --> 36:21.219
- Last night.

36:21.230 --> 36:24.090
- My sister.

- She was completely naked,

36:24.099 --> 36:26.179
like a centerfold.

- And I'm in bed--

36:34.239 --> 36:35.280
- She has.

- I did one once.

36:35.289 --> 36:38.119
No, but I was covered.

36:35.289 --> 36:38.119
- No, but you're gonna do one--

- Your hair was

36:38.130 --> 36:39.199
covering everything.

36:39.210 --> 36:41.110
- But it's your man.

Sit on down.

- Thought? Okay.

37:06.150 --> 37:08.070
Are you okay?

- Where's she been

37:08.079 --> 37:10.059
the whole damn time?

37:10.070 --> 37:12.019
I mean, you know.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.050
- I just wanted

37:12.030 --> 37:14.050
to say good night.

37:14.059 --> 37:17.110
- Girl, where you been?

37:14.059 --> 37:17.110
[laughs]

37:17.119 --> 37:19.219
- Good night, everybody.

37:17.119 --> 37:19.219
- Good night.

37:19.230 --> 37:22.230
- How was tonight?

37:19.230 --> 37:22.230
- It was really, really nice.

37:22.239 --> 37:24.199
- Oh, good. I'm glad.

37:22.239 --> 37:24.199
- Really nice.

37:24.210 --> 37:27.150
- I'm sad I missed it.

37:24.210 --> 37:27.150
- What happened?

37:27.159 --> 37:31.090
- Um...last night,

37:27.159 --> 37:31.090
like, I was--

37:31.099 --> 37:33.059
I went to bed

37:31.099 --> 37:33.059
at like 11:30.

37:33.070 --> 37:36.130
I was in my bathroom,

37:33.070 --> 37:36.130
and showered, getting ready,

37:36.139 --> 37:39.110
and was naked,

37:36.139 --> 37:39.110
and Sutton walked in.

37:39.119 --> 37:40.219
Like, she was

returning a jacket.

37:40.230 --> 37:42.059
- Yeah.

37:40.230 --> 37:42.059
- This is Crystal's coat.

37:42.070 --> 37:43.150
- Oh, that's Crystal's coat.

37:43.159 --> 37:45.039
- And you know

37:43.159 --> 37:45.039
what I'm gonna go do?

37:45.050 --> 37:46.219
- Bring it up?

37:45.050 --> 37:46.219
- Yes.

37:46.230 --> 37:49.090
Because that's what

37:46.230 --> 37:49.090
girlfriends do for girlfriends.

37:49.099 --> 37:52.079
Crystal, are you up?

44:11.070 --> 44:13.019

to all of a sudden be done.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.059
- It's sad.

44:16.070 --> 44:18.219
- It is.

44:16.070 --> 44:18.219
- What the hell?
