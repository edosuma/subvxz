Hey, I’m doing what I can
to save my marriage.

00:08.049 --> 00:11.469
He is a risk to his wife, to himself.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.304
You thinking
about calling early intervention?

00:13.430 --> 00:15.265
He came home drunk
and started yelling at me.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.809
He went and got a bat
and then he came at me.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.145
If he had his gun on him,
he would have shot me.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.646

Yeah, the bullet grazed me.
Hurts like a son of a bitch though.

-What happened?
-I’m driving to the gym,

01:27.962 --> 01:30.090
I see this Black dude sprint
across the street.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.926
He’s got a gun in his hand,
so I give chase.

01:33.426 --> 01:37.388
I’m looking around, I hear some movement
from over the fence, I look over.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.475
I see a light come on behind me,
I turn around

01:40.600 --> 01:44.521
and there’s a guy inside this apartment,
he’s got his gun trained on me.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.357
I didn't have a chance to do nothing.
He shot me right in the arm.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.068
So I returned fire.
I guess, I got him in the shoulder.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.153
Uh... the Black guy you were chasing?

01:52.529 --> 01:54.739
He hopped over the fence
to ask if everything was all right.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.324
He boogied.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.121

Stan, you might wanna rethink
your attitude here.

02:09.921 --> 02:13.341

I’m sorry, if I’m a little fired up.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.114

on a trash can looking over the fence.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.828

02:42.287 --> 02:43.580
and I guess he saw my gun,

02:43.663 --> 02:46.708
because he reaches like he’s going
into his pocket for a gun.

02:47.417 --> 02:52.839
So, I fire a warning shot over his head,
step back into the room, I wait a second,

02:52.964 --> 02:56.050
And then the glass shatters
and he’s firing at me.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.761
So I fire back.

-You got a permit for the gun?
-Yeah, target permit.

-And you say he reached for his gun?
-Yeah.

03:04.809 --> 03:08.771

-No, his hands were empty, like I said.

Uh... it might have factored in a little.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.429
So you're saying you keep the gun
in the apartment for protection?

09:15.596 --> 09:18.099
No, 'cause that’d be illegal now,
wouldn’t it?

09:18.641 --> 09:21.477
So you're saying that you grabbed the gun
as a last resort?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.730
-Absolutely.
-You told us at the scene that the...

in his hand, I would’ve blown his ass away

that’s when I fired the warning shot.

this part differently.

then backed up and waited.

We’re looking into that.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.417
-Any word on Hatcher?
-He’s on his way over here.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.585
How’d it go with the perp?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.754
You mean, the guy in the apartment?
We’re getting there.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.715
-What’s that mean?
-You’re not familiar with the expression?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.425
EDDIE: I prefer specifics.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.844
We’ve just got a couple inconsistencies,
nothing too major though.

11:19.136 --> 11:21.430
-Like what, specifically?
-ANDY: You see, if we tell you, Gibson,

11:21.514 --> 11:23.474
then you’re in the loop
and you can be held accountable.

11:23.599 --> 11:24.600
God forbid, right?

11:24.892 --> 11:26.769
JOHN: If we run up
against something significant, Sarge,

11:26.894 --> 11:28.604
we’ll bring you up to speed, right away.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.731
Old dog or not,
you could learn a lot from him.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.567
Yeah, that’s why I carry around a pad
and pen.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.698
What a week I’m having,
can you believe this?

11:39.073 --> 11:40.116
I’m so sorry.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.034
-Hey, partner.
-Hey, how you feeling?

11:42.201 --> 11:43.244
Arm’s fine.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.162
Hour and a half
with the Duty Captain was the real pain.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.207
-STAN: How’s it going, Boss?
-Hey, Buddy.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.251
You had me scared sick there,
when I got the call.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.002
No, worries. It all worked out.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.839
So what’s going on
with the guy that shot me?

11:55.005 --> 11:57.299
Yeah, that’s what we need
to talk to you about, real quick.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.802
Good, ’cause I gotta talk
to you guys about something too.

(TELEPHONE RINGING)

12:06.726 --> 12:09.353
(SIGHS) What I told you at the scene,
I was wrong about something.

12:09.854 --> 12:10.855
Namely?

12:11.272 --> 12:14.066
I had my gun out
when I was chasing that Black dude,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.527
but when I had to pull myself up
on the fence, to look over,

12:16.652 --> 12:18.696
I holstered my gun
So I could use both hands.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.241
So, I want to clear that up.
My adrenaline was pumping at the scene,

12:22.575 --> 12:25.578
So I wasn’t exactly thinking straight.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.663
-Okay, well that helps us.
-STAN: Good.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.790
And, uh... this whole thing
with going to the gym

12:29.874 --> 12:33.377
at 5:00 A.M, that you were worried about.
I could see how that would look unusual.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.837
But I bought a three-year membership

12:34.920 --> 12:37.047
as a new-year’s resolution
and I haven’t been using it.

12:38.674 --> 12:40.926
I couldn’t sleep,
so I decided to go work out.

12:41.635 --> 12:42.928
-Yeah.
-STAN: Yeah.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.890
So, you said you had some questions?

12:48.976 --> 12:50.686
Uh... I think you answered most of them.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.688
ANDY: How long were you standing
on that garbage can,

12:52.813 --> 12:53.856
looking over the fence?

12:54.899 --> 12:56.484
(SIGHS) Half a minute, a minute.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.611
I was letting my eyes adjust to the dark

12:58.736 --> 13:00.738
to see if I could spot
that Black dude moving around.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.157
Guy in the apartment’s still saying
he fired a warning shot.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.660
You didn’t get him off that?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.746
-Obviously not.
-STAN: Well, he’s lying.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.207
And at this point,
whatever sympathy I had for him is gone,

13:11.415 --> 13:12.792
So a... are you gonna arrest him?

13:13.626 --> 13:16.462
We’re, uh... you know,
moving forward, Stan.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.006
Cool.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.009
Anything else?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.929
-No, we’re good, thanks.
-STAN: Okay.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.187
-Well, he sure got his story straight.
-Wasn’t he supposed to?

13:33.395 --> 13:34.814
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

13:48.244 --> 13:51.872
I talked to a co-worker of Larry Edmunds.
He said, after Larry got robbed,

13:51.997 --> 13:54.124
he was telling people that he’d like
to see someone try and rob him again.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.418
Meaning he was itching
to use his gun, right?

13:56.544 --> 13:58.003
That was my inference, yeah.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.130
This guy was a time bomb, ready to go off.

14:00.422 --> 14:03.342

to see Detectives Medavoy or Jones?

14:03.425 --> 14:04.677

-GREG: Yeah.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.428
Right this way, Mr. Dooling.

14:06.762 --> 14:07.763
Is my brother in trouble?

14:07.930 --> 14:09.849
Uh... just a little misunderstanding
we need to clear up.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.350
All right, thanks.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.939
That was ballistics, they pulled a slug
from the fence where Hatcher was standing.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.441
-Nine millimeter.
-Translation?

14:19.608 --> 14:22.111
Guy in the apartment’s target permit is
for a 22.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.154
So he had an illegal gun, in other words.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.866
-Can we arrest this guy already, or what?
-I would hope so.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.492
We’ll head down there and talk to him.

14:28.617 --> 14:31.161

about where his bail’s gonna be set at?

What’s got the hotel so pissed off
is not so much the damage,

14:57.104 --> 14:59.481
but that Ryan booked
without explaining or apologizing.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.109

have him do both those things,

Just tell us what’s going on here, Eric.

He got into the club scene.
You know, those all-night things.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.843
I tried to let him get it out
of his system, but he never did.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.678
So I... I had to give him the boot.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.765
Well, uh... friends
or places he hung out you know of?

15:32.848 --> 15:34.683
He was hanging out with this poser.

are doing something, right?

he had said that he got this good job,

I mean, whose name was
the hotel room registered under?

15:54.161 --> 15:55.871
Well, Ryan’s. He was living there.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.707

in a loft out in Tribeca

How did the shooting go down this morning?

21:44.428 --> 21:48.015
Stan was driving to the gym real early,
saw a perp, gave chase.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.310
Some neighbor mistook Stan as a burglar,
fired off a round.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.855
-This is over on Broome and Elizabeth.
-Neighbor’s looking negligent.

21:54.938 --> 21:57.399
Since him having an illegal gun,
provoked the whole thing.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.447
-You didn’t hear this from me, right?
-Right.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.993
Stan’s ex-girlfriend Lucy,
she lives on Broome and Elizabeth.

22:08.952 --> 22:11.204
When me and Scott were married,
we went there for dinner one time.

22:12.831 --> 22:13.957
Lucy Timmons.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.753
And that doesn’t count as a favor,
that’s on the house...

22:18.545 --> 22:19.963
’cause Stan’s a complete asshole.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.508
I gotta head back.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.361
Hi.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.740
-Ms. Timmons?
-May I help you?

22:46.948 --> 22:48.950
Detectives Sipowicz and Clark, 15th Squad.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.703
Yeah, I got your message.
I’ve just been really swamped.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.789
Well, we were in the neighborhood, anyway.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.916
-Do you have a few minutes?
-Sure.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.419
You and Stan Hatcher dated
for a couple years?

23:01.421 --> 23:02.589
That’s right. (SIGHS)

23:02.881 --> 23:05.467
Are you aware he was involved
in a shooting this morning

23:05.550 --> 23:06.718
at the building next to yours?

23:06.927 --> 23:10.138
Yeah, I, uh... looked out my window when,
you know, after it all happened,

23:10.222 --> 23:13.183
And... (INHALES DEEPLY)
...I saw Stan there and, uh... yeah.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.394
-That’s all.
-Was he with you last night?

23:15.727 --> 23:17.562
No, we broke up months ago.

23:18.146 --> 23:20.774
He was shot while looking over the fence
that borders your building.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.319
-I didn’t know that.
-You see our dilemma here, Ms. Timmons?

23:25.445 --> 23:28.115
-Sure, but Stan wasn’t with me.
-Have you had problems with Stan

23:28.198 --> 23:29.699
making unannounced visits
since the breakup?

23:30.033 --> 23:31.952
You’re getting
into personal aspects of my life

23:32.035 --> 23:33.829
that I’m not comfortable sharing with you.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.998
Your neighbor got shot as well,
people could have been killed.

23:37.082 --> 23:40.544
So unfortunately, we’re gonna have
to delve into your personal aspects.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.504
The alternative is a court order.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.674
-So, what’s it gonna be?
-Do you really wanna know?

23:45.841 --> 23:47.342
Would you really do anything about it?

23:47.926 --> 23:49.636
I don’t know what Hatcher’s been filling
your head with

23:49.719 --> 23:51.430
in terms of cops protecting cops,

23:51.555 --> 23:53.515
but we came here
to find out what’s going on.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.979
What would you like to know, Detective?

23:59.104 --> 24:01.481
Has Hatcher been coming
by your apartment uninvited?

24:01.982 --> 24:05.235
-Yes.
-So, your relationship with him ended bad?

24:05.569 --> 24:08.155
-Quite.
-So if we were to make the assumption

24:08.363 --> 24:10.907
that, uh... he was looking
over that fence to spy on you,

24:11.199 --> 24:13.869
-Oh, you’d probably be right.
-Was he ever abusive?

24:14.536 --> 24:16.371
Not physically.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.248
Have you ever looked
into getting an order of protection?

24:18.415 --> 24:20.709
I don’t want to piss Stan off
more than he already is.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.252
I just wanna be left alone.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.171
All right,
we appreciate you leveling with us.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.716
Don’t tell him we talked.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.802
-Please?
-Sure.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.351
-Have a seat, Eva.
-EVA: Thanks.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.271
GREG: You know a Ryan Dooling?

24:42.063 --> 24:43.398
-Yeah.
-When did you see him last?

24:43.648 --> 24:47.235
Uh... a couple days ago
at this club, The Light Factory.

24:47.360 --> 24:50.280
So, you didn’t just stop
by his hotel last night?

24:50.363 --> 24:52.365
-The Hotel Fauntleroy?
-No.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.034
BALDWIN: Oh, the night clerk said,

24:54.117 --> 24:56.369
an attractive brunette asked him
which room Ryan was in.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.706
-Now, that wasn’t you?
-(SCOFFS)

25:01.291 --> 25:02.751
-Let’s start over.
-Thanks.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.546
BALDWIN: Did you see Ryan
at the Hotel Fauntleroy last night?

25:06.630 --> 25:08.256
-Yes.
-Why did you lie about it?

25:08.548 --> 25:11.593
I promised my dad
that I’d stop hanging around Ryan.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.887
-Sorry.
-Did you and Ryan argue?

25:13.970 --> 25:15.430
No, just hung out.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.266
'Cause there was some damage
to Ryan’s hotel room.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.228
Damage that would indicate
that an argument transpired.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.188
Not even close.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.399
I went over there,
tried to talk him into going out,

25:26.900 --> 25:29.402
He said he needed to stay in, so I split.

25:29.569 --> 25:30.820
Did he say what he was gonna be doing

25:30.904 --> 25:32.197
-after you left?
-No.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.448
Did he say if anybody was coming

25:33.573 --> 25:35.075
-to meet him?
-No. (SCOFFS)

25:35.200 --> 25:37.953
You know where Ryan is now?
’Cause we gotta get this worked out.

25:38.495 --> 25:42.082
-Isn’t he at that hotel?
-BALDWIN: No, he cleared out this morning.

25:42.832 --> 25:43.917
Then, I don’t know where he is.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.877
Well, who are his friends
that he maybe crashed with?

25:46.336 --> 25:47.879
No, we weren’t really that close.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.090
Well, close enough
for your father to have met him

25:50.173 --> 25:51.341
and formed an opinion.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.135
Believe me, it took my father
all of ten seconds

25:54.636 --> 25:56.555
to think that Ryan was a con artist.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.057
Eva, you seem like a nice girl.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.686
We’d prefer this to be the last time
we’d have to inconvenience you.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.271
I wouldn’t mind that either.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.356
Good.

26:07.315 --> 26:09.943
Well, just so you know,
we need to locate Ryan.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.445
and we need to find out
what happened in that hotel room,

26:12.654 --> 26:15.490
and if we discover later
that you withheld information on us,

26:16.032 --> 26:17.450
we’re really gonna inconvenience you.

26:20.912 --> 26:24.207
There’s a bar on third, the Powerhouse.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.043
-Ryan hangs out there a lot.
-All right, good.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.963
He must have done a hell
of a lot of damage to this hotel room.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.716
-(DOOR THUDS)
-Thanks for coming in.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.635
-(STAN CLEARS THROAT)
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)

26:39.180 --> 26:40.348
Such serious looks.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.018
There’s something we need
to talk about, Stan.

26:43.935 --> 26:47.689
-Apparently.
-We got an anonymous phone call, a tip.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.149
Now we gotta deal with it.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.318
Let’s deal with it.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.321
Your ex-girlfriend lives in the building
next to where the shooting was?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.240
-That’s right, she does.
-Why didn’t you tell us?

26:57.657 --> 26:59.868
’Cause that had nothing to do
with me chasing that perp.

27:00.243 --> 27:03.580
You were standing on a trash can looking
up into your ex-girlfriend’s window.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.498
That’s what some people
could interpret it as.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.751
And that’s another reason
why I didn’t wanna tell you.

27:07.917 --> 27:10.587
I didn’t wanna put you in the position
where you had to lie for me.

27:10.712 --> 27:13.298
We got a civilian shot, and he’s arrested.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.717
For good reason, I was chasing a perp.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.510
I was doing my job.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.304
And whether or not you believe me,

27:19.429 --> 27:21.598
that son of a bitch in the apartment
is at fault.

27:21.806 --> 27:25.810
He’s walking around with an illegal gun
wanting to kill an intruder.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.937
And I was outside his apartment.

27:28.188 --> 27:32.442
And he did not fire a warning shot,
he was shooting to kill me.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.527
You were spying on your ex.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.864
-That’s what got the whole ball started.
-I was chasing a perp!

27:37.947 --> 27:39.449
Hey, bring it down a peg, Stan.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.409
He needs to bring it down a peg.

27:41.576 --> 27:45.163
You’ve had it out for me since day one.
And to hell, if I’m gonna take it anymore.

27:45.246 --> 27:47.165
Let me know when you’re done
so we can get back to the shooting.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.085
Oh, we’re not getting back to nothing.
We’re done talking.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.048
-(DOOR SLAMS)
-All right,

27:55.173 --> 27:56.549
I... I know you don’t like this guy,

27:56.675 --> 27:58.426
and he is a hotheaded prick.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.637
But if it was any other cop,
we’d let the ex-girlfriend

28:00.720 --> 28:01.971
aspect stay a secret.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.099
So Hatcher wasn’t doing anything wrong?

28:04.224 --> 28:07.268
Absolutely, he was.
But not enough to pull the plug on him.

28:07.477 --> 28:10.146
See, this is what people keep doing
with this dickhead.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.649
They cover for him,
he goes onto the next squad,

28:12.774 --> 28:15.276
He screws up all over again.
This guy should not be a cop.

28:15.443 --> 28:18.029
I know, he didn’t bust down her door,
he didn’t make any threats,

28:18.113 --> 28:19.823
and she said he wasn’t physically abusive.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.241
Do you believe that?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.493
I’ve dropped a dime
on a cop I thought was a threat,

28:23.618 --> 28:26.162
but we don’t have enough
to pull the plug on Hatcher right now.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.915
And if we did, we’d be buying
ourselves a world of problems.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.834
Meaning you’re afraid of Hatcher’s uncle?

28:31.501 --> 28:33.420
Whether I am or not, we don’t have enough.

28:35.171 --> 28:37.173
Great, wonderful.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.848
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

28:45.014 --> 28:46.766
-Everything all right?
-Sure.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.686
’Cause I thought,
I heard a door being slammed shut.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.355
We get a cross-breeze going
through here sometimes.

28:52.522 --> 28:55.400
-Well, take care of it.
-You got it, Sarge.

28:56.025 --> 28:58.486
Hey, Ryan Dooling was grabbed up
by Anti-Crime getting on a bus.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.113
Yeah, we’ll, uh... bring him in.

29:03.366 --> 29:04.451
What?

29:08.705 --> 29:10.081
(SIGHS) I’m a little in the dark here.

29:10.206 --> 29:12.375
It’s gonna go down as a good shoot, right?

29:12.667 --> 29:14.335
That's right.
There were a couple questions

29:14.419 --> 29:16.212
that were answered. Done deal.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.923
-That’s all I need to know?
-JOHN: Yep.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.143
(DOOR SLAMS)

29:33.354 --> 29:34.606
You got a second?

29:42.363 --> 29:47.160
Listen, sometimes I get worked up,
and my temper flares. I apologize.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.663
-Okay.
-But I’m just trying to figure out

29:50.789 --> 29:52.874
what it is you got against me.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.918
And forget about what happened today.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.378
This started when I set foot
in this squad.

29:57.712 --> 29:59.839
Is it because I smacked
that suspect around?

30:00.507 --> 30:02.509
Or, you know, gave a little payback

30:02.592 --> 30:05.762
to the freak who kidnapped those women
and kept them as sex-slaves?

30:06.346 --> 30:08.306
I mean, you’re an active cop, right?

30:08.473 --> 30:10.475
You’re not afraid
to put your hands on a guy.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.936
We got more in common
than you think, Sipowicz.

30:14.312 --> 30:17.857
Is... is that it? Are you, like,
threatened by me or something?

30:18.191 --> 30:21.736
In terms of this job, Stan,
we got nothing in common.

30:22.278 --> 30:25.323
And if it was up to me, there’s no way
you’d be carrying a badge and a gun.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.700
Well, I thought we could work this out.

30:28.451 --> 30:29.452
I guess not.

30:29.577 --> 30:31.830
Everybody’s entitled
to a screw-up here and there.

30:32.080 --> 30:36.501
But you’ve made a career out of it.
Do yourself a favor, find a new home.

30:36.584 --> 30:38.795
’Cause I’m not gonna let you
put a stink on this squad.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.088
I’m not going anywhere.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.549
If anybody’s due
for a change of venue, it’s you.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.218
-You think?
-Damn straight.

30:45.301 --> 30:48.179
What? Are you gonna run to your uncle
and go sit on his lap and beg him

30:48.304 --> 30:50.598
-to do something about me?
-I don’t know about the run part,

30:50.682 --> 30:52.809
but sounds like you got
a pretty good idea how things work.

30:53.726 --> 30:54.894
Well, let me tell you something,

30:54.978 --> 30:58.648
you, your uncle,
and anybody who bears a resemblance

30:58.773 --> 31:00.733
can shove it clean up their ass!

31:02.986 --> 31:05.154
Better start thinking
about finding a new command, Pal.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.576
(DOOR THUDS)

31:20.503 --> 31:21.629
So Ryan, uh...

31:22.255 --> 31:24.299
Why you leaving town in such a hurry?

31:24.841 --> 31:26.259
RYAN: Just kinda done with New York.

31:26.467 --> 31:27.927
Ready for that next adventure.

31:28.011 --> 31:31.306
Yeah, you got some unfinished business
back at the Fauntleroy.

31:31.639 --> 31:32.724
Don’t laugh...

31:33.099 --> 31:36.394
I’m serious, I was gonna mail them
the three days’ I owed once I got a job.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.021
We’re talking
about the bullet hole in your wall.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.023
-Say what?
-You heard me.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.109
-I don’t know anything about that.
-We’re figuring the gun went off

31:43.192 --> 31:45.111
either when Eva was there
or sometime after.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.363
I'm telling you,
I don’t know about a bullet hole.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.617
You know, your, uh...
your current approach here, Ryan?

31:50.825 --> 31:52.243
The head in the sand thing?

31:52.577 --> 31:54.704
That’s just gonna
get you stuck here in New York.

31:55.121 --> 31:59.667
But, uh... tell us what happened,
apologize to the hotel for the hassle,

31:59.751 --> 32:01.669
and you can go on your merry way.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.504
Have you guys seen that hotel?

32:03.630 --> 32:07.175
There’s more bullet holes
in that place than, you know, beds.

32:07.425 --> 32:10.178
-You gotta level with us.
-What makes you so sure it was me?

32:11.012 --> 32:13.473
George Schiffer, the old man living
in the room next to you.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.642
-Remember him?
-Yeah, I know George.

32:16.184 --> 32:19.604
He’s dead...from a bullet
that came from your room.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.191
Now this guy was just living his life,
minding his own business.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.818
He deserved better than to go out
with a bullet in his chest,

32:26.277 --> 32:28.655
but you and your stupid-ass
club friends caused his death.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.531
-I didn’t do it.
-Hell yeah, you did.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.617
Unless you convince us different.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.371
-It was Eva.
-GREG: Eva?

32:36.955 --> 32:39.874
-What happened?
-She came by ’cause I owed her money,

32:41.250 --> 32:43.169
But I’d blown it all.
So, she pulls out a gun

32:43.294 --> 32:44.587
to threaten me, and it just went off.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.091
So we agreed to deny it ever happened.

32:48.299 --> 32:50.051
GREG: You know, from what I’ve heard
about you, Ryan.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.095
It wouldn’t be a stretch you pinning
this on a girl.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.764
Eva fired the gun! That’s what happened.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.183
-You’re sticking around.
-George is really dead?

32:58.768 --> 33:00.478
You don’t need to put on the fake grief.

33:01.104 --> 33:03.648
-Actually, it’s kind of an insult.
-I’m not faking nothing.

33:04.023 --> 33:06.401
I moved into that place,
’cause my brother kicked me out.

33:06.734 --> 33:09.112
I was completely alone,
and I guess, I was crying.

33:09.237 --> 33:11.197
There’s a knock on my door,
and it’s George.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.282
He asked me if I was okay.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.703
He’s the only person to ask me that in,
I don’t even know, how long.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.039
If this comes back to you...

33:23.751 --> 33:25.503
All right, so then the guy
in the apartment

33:25.628 --> 33:28.589
gets charged with criminal possession
of an unregistered weapon,

33:28.756 --> 33:31.259
reckless endangerment,
and second-degree assault.

33:31.592 --> 33:34.012
No priors,
so figure he’ll do less than a year.

33:34.595 --> 33:35.972
Even if he just got probation,

33:36.514 --> 33:38.057
as long as he gets the message
he was in the wrong.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.436
-Sure.
-You all right with that, Stan?

33:42.186 --> 33:43.980
No problem.
I’m not looking to hurt the guy.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.274
We’ll get the case folder
over to you after we’re done.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.735
-VALERIE: Have a good night.
-RITA: Thanks Val, you too.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.199
-Thanks, man.
-You got it.

34:04.667 --> 34:07.336
-I didn’t fire a gun.
-GREG: Eva...

34:07.587 --> 34:10.256
You’re dug in, obviously,
and I know, at a certain point

34:10.339 --> 34:13.384
people feel they’ve committed to a lie,
and they won’t undo it,

34:13.468 --> 34:14.886
because more than anything,
they’re embarrassed.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.889
But we’re not your parents.
We’re not gonna hold it against you.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.224
We got Ryan saying, you fired the gun.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.143
We got witnesses,
we can parade in front of a judge.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.895
You gotta start thinking clearly now, Eva.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.481
Ryan’s got a lot of nerve
blaming this on me.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.524
-Did he fire the gun?
-(SCOFFS)

34:29.942 --> 34:33.154
I am so done with this bullshit.

34:33.613 --> 34:36.115
And I swear, and you can tell the people
at the hotel this,

34:36.199 --> 34:39.202
-I am absolutely going to change my life.
-Okay, we’ll tell them.

34:39.327 --> 34:41.162
’Cause this was just the capper.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.498
This was the wake-up call
that I need it, I'm done.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.917
I am enrolling
at Nassau Community College today.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.002
What happened last night?

34:48.336 --> 34:51.297
I met Ryan
at the Light Factory, this club.

34:51.506 --> 34:53.549
and he finds out that I want to be a DJ.

34:53.883 --> 34:54.926
(SCOFFS)

34:55.134 --> 34:58.137
And he tells me that he works
for a record label

34:58.805 --> 35:00.932
and a bunch of sweet-talk later,

35:01.099 --> 35:04.852
he gets me to give him 500 bucks
to cover production costs,

35:05.269 --> 35:07.480
But then each time I see him,
I start getting the brush-off.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.690
So I have my cousin follow him one night,

35:10.358 --> 35:13.194
And I find out that he’s staying
at that dump, the Fauntleroy.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.113
Couple days go by,
I don’t see him at the club,

35:15.404 --> 35:17.281
I went to his hotel to get my money.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.159
-Did you take the gun with you?
-Yes, I did.

35:20.451 --> 35:23.746
And I can’t tell you why,
other than I was so frustrated

35:23.830 --> 35:28.626
and so tired of being lied to.
And 500 is a lot to me.

35:29.085 --> 35:32.672
And I was just pissed
for letting myself get conned.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.174
-Where’d you get the gun?
-My cousin.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.593
He was gonna come with me,
but he had to pull a double-shift.

35:37.718 --> 35:38.845
I know where he keeps it,

35:38.928 --> 35:40.805
so I just rolled over
to his place and I took it.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.683
So, what happened when you got
to Ryan’s room?

35:43.808 --> 35:46.519
He finally admits that he doesn’t work
for a record label

35:46.602 --> 35:48.020
and that he blew all my money on drugs.

35:48.521 --> 35:51.107
So I pulled out the gun
to show him that I was serious,

35:51.649 --> 35:54.527
-and I pulled back the...
-Hammer.

35:54.735 --> 35:57.864
Right, I cocked the hammer back,
just to scare him.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.992
There was no way I was going to shoot him.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.828
But when I pulled my finger back
on the trigger, the gun went off.

36:03.911 --> 36:06.080
And it scared the hell out
of the both of us.

36:06.247 --> 36:09.000
So there I am in this skanky hotel room

36:09.125 --> 36:12.003
with a gun in my hand,
trying to get 500 bucks back

36:12.128 --> 36:16.132
from a lying drug addict that was supposed
to make me a superstar DJ.

36:16.799 --> 36:20.761
I’m so done with all that, I swear to God.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.096
You need to write that up.

36:23.556 --> 36:24.557
Okay.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.311
EVA: "I accidentally...

36:29.145 --> 36:31.647
"fired... the gun...

36:32.773 --> 36:34.066
"in Ryan Dooling’s room.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.402
"I am very sorry."

36:42.909 --> 36:46.204
There’s, uh... there’s something else
we need to talk about now, Eva.

36:46.871 --> 36:47.914
What?

36:48.789 --> 36:52.710
The bullet you fired went through a wall
and a man was killed.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.631
-No.
-Yes.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.052
-No.
-You’re looking at

37:01.177 --> 37:02.929
criminally negligent homicide.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.974
-I’m going to jail?
-Well, it’s up to a jury,

37:07.516 --> 37:10.019
but someone died as a result
of your behavior.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.021
We’re sorry.

37:20.279 --> 37:21.447
Heading out, Stan?

37:21.530 --> 37:23.741
Yeah. Going down to Bellevue
to get the bandage changed.

37:23.824 --> 37:25.743
Most guys would have taken a day off.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.703
-Says a lot about you.
-Thanks, Sarge.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.040
-All right, Partner.
-Night, Stan. Heal up.

37:32.541 --> 37:35.419
Hey, a buddy of mine
has his monthly poker game tonight.

37:35.544 --> 37:38.714
Low stakes, good guys, always fun.
I can get you a seat, if you want.

37:38.839 --> 37:40.174
I already got plans. Thanks, though.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.301
I’m out.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.520
-Everything all right?
-Yeah, thanks.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.565
There’s nothing I need to know about?
I mean, I am partnered with the guy.

38:00.736 --> 38:03.698
Just keep an eye on him.
Don’t let him drag you into something bad.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.616
-Okay.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.500
Hey.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.168
JOHN: Yeah?

38:16.877 --> 38:18.170
I’ll come down right now.

38:28.472 --> 38:29.515
What’s up?

38:29.724 --> 38:31.726
So if there’s one thing we learned
about Hatcher today,

38:31.851 --> 38:33.811
it’s that he’s got a jealous streak
and a problem with women.

38:34.061 --> 38:35.271
-Agreed?
-Okay.

38:35.354 --> 38:36.981
You know his wife was murdered, right?

38:37.606 --> 38:39.859
Yeah, the gang he was looking
into to bring down,

38:39.984 --> 38:41.819
tried to kill him with a car bomb,
and got his wife instead.

38:41.944 --> 38:43.571
No one was ever collared for it.

38:44.613 --> 38:45.865
You know what?
You’re starting to worry me.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.533
So I go look at the case folder.

38:47.950 --> 38:51.537
The whole investigation centered
on this gang-retaliation theory.

38:51.871 --> 38:55.249
Go home, be with Connie,
play with your kids, chill out.

38:55.374 --> 38:58.336
So in the fives, I see
that Hatcher’s partner in the gang unit

38:58.586 --> 39:01.130
asked to be re-assigned
right after this whole thing went down.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.424
The guy’s name is Carl Garrety.

39:03.632 --> 39:06.427
I call to find him,
he’s no longer on the job.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.263
He three-quartered out
off a knee injury three years back.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.265
He’s now an insurance investigator.

39:12.224 --> 39:13.476
So I’m going to see him...

39:14.226 --> 39:16.395
-in an hour.
-Andy, take a step back

39:16.604 --> 39:17.605
and look at what you’re doing.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.106
I’m going to meet this guy,
you coming or not?

39:26.655 --> 39:27.740
-Hold up.

39:42.254 --> 39:43.881
...if this gang was trying
to kill your partner,

39:43.964 --> 39:45.883
didn’t you think they’d try
and take you out, too?

39:46.467 --> 39:48.761
I guess. Maybe a little, yeah.

39:50.137 --> 39:51.472
It was a crazy time.

39:54.558 --> 39:55.559
(SIGHS)

39:57.686 --> 39:58.938
You close to Hatcher’s wife?

40:01.023 --> 40:03.401
-Why would you say that?
-You’re throwing shots back.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.319
Seems like it’s difficult to talk about.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.363
Well, she was a great lady.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.657
ANDY: We just talked
to his ex-girlfriend today

40:09.740 --> 40:11.242
over the shooting that happened?

40:11.784 --> 40:14.286
-She said Hatcher was abusive.
-Huh.

40:15.704 --> 40:17.748
Were you aware of any abuse
between hatcher and his wife?

40:19.500 --> 40:20.876
They had their share of problems.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.586
Along the lines of what?

40:23.379 --> 40:24.505
She wasn’t happy.

40:25.714 --> 40:27.550
-She was afraid of him.
-How do you know this?

40:29.009 --> 40:30.219
She confided in me.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.431
Why didn’t you come forward
with that information?

40:33.556 --> 40:36.475
I mean, it’s not like you and Hatcher
were the best of buddies.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.352
All you had to do was drop a dime.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.439
I was married, too.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.567
You were having an affair with her.

40:46.652 --> 40:50.531
I couldn’t say anything then,
’cause I was scared of losing my wife.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.575
I was scared of what Stan would do.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.328
’Cause if he did kill Marcy,
he was capable of doing the same to me.

40:57.705 --> 40:58.747
I’m divorced now.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.459
So there’s no one
to hurt by talking about it.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.211
And as far as my fears
of what Stan would do?

41:06.464 --> 41:08.007
To hell with it. I don’t care anymore.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.595
What did Hatcher’s wife
tell you about him?

41:13.304 --> 41:15.806
She was ready to leave, she told him that.

41:16.682 --> 41:18.559
He accused her of having an affair...

41:20.478 --> 41:21.979
(INHALES) ...and she admitted to it.

41:22.104 --> 41:25.524
How soon, after she told you,
did she turn up dead?

41:27.318 --> 41:28.319
Three days.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.864
I kept hoping
they’d find a diary entry or...

41:31.947 --> 41:34.825
(INHALES) ...maybe she told a girlfriend
and they’d come forward.

41:35.367 --> 41:38.496
So I wouldn’t have to get involved.
Plus, who knows?

41:40.498 --> 41:41.749
It could have been a coincidence.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.210
It could have been a retaliation hit.

(SIGHS) Oh, man.

42:01.435 --> 42:02.811
Hatcher killed his wife.

42:04.104 --> 42:06.440

or he did it himself,

42:06.565 --> 42:09.818
but I guarantee you,
Hatcher killed his wife.
