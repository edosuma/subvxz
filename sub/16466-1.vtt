<i>Oh, my God.</i>

00:47.216 --> 00:50.951
<i>You, like, threw up back here
with your preparation.
I swear to God.</i>

00:50.953 --> 00:52.886
<i>That's like a Sarah tornado.</i>

00:52.888 --> 00:55.921
<i>You got your...
your mom's tent, I see.</i>

00:55.923 --> 00:58.090
<i>- Which is a classic. Oldie, but goodie.
- Yes.</i>

00:58.092 --> 01:03.763
<i>- Of course.
- We got "people,"
"ok!," "star."</i>

01:03.765 --> 01:06.132
<i>We are going to an empty island.</i>

01:06.134 --> 01:08.067
<i>Oh, my God!
There's like 10 of them!</i>

01:08.069 --> 01:11.737
<i>- This is horrible news.
- We need entertainment.</i>

01:11.739 --> 01:14.206
<i>- There's nothing else there.
-  I'm there.</i>

01:14.208 --> 01:16.941
<i>- Yeah, you're very pretty.
- I have so many stories.</i>

01:16.943 --> 01:20.378
There's only so long
I can look at you and just
be like, "you're so pretty."

01:20.380 --> 01:22.914
And then I need
to look at trash.
You know what I mean?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.983
- Right.
- I'm fucking happy, man.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.951
You know, I'm happy.
I'm happy we're here.

01:26.953 --> 01:28.687
I'm happy, too.
I'm excited.

<i>- "We got crabs."
-  I can't even...</i>

01:48.941 --> 01:52.776
- like, that's crazy...
- I feel like we should
go in there

01:52.778 --> 01:55.112
and just tell them that
they need to take that down.

01:55.114 --> 01:56.846
At least they're being up front
and honest about it

01:56.848 --> 01:58.281
<i>- 'cause usually, you know,
- That's true.</i>

01:58.283 --> 02:00.416
Guys don't tell you, and then,
you know what, you end up

02:00.418 --> 02:03.886
<i>- with a pantyful of lice.

02:26.443 --> 02:28.076
<i>Eight years, are you serious?</i>

02:33.216 --> 02:36.318
<i>That's weird. Is that...
are you serious?</i>

02:36.320 --> 02:38.986
<i>- Sarah...
- Is that...</i>

02:38.988 --> 02:42.456
- ...why is Abby
sitting right there?
- Oh.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.091
Why would you not tell me this?

02:48.930 --> 02:51.265
This is such a bad idea.

02:51.267 --> 02:54.368
Let's look at this
like an opportunity.

02:54.370 --> 02:56.103
- She...
- Come on.
It's gonna be good.

02:56.105 --> 02:58.105
- This is, like, unreasonable.
- Come on.

03:01.008 --> 03:03.109
- Hey, abs.
- What are you doing?

03:03.111 --> 03:04.444
- Give me a hug.
- What are you doing? No, no.

03:04.446 --> 03:06.379
- Love me, love me.
- What is this?

03:06.381 --> 03:09.415
You were like,
"oh, let's go on this
great weekend. You and me."

03:09.417 --> 03:11.251
<i>- I know.
- "We're gonna go out
to the island.</i>

03:11.253 --> 03:13.453
We'll reconnect.
It'll be so awesome.
You and me."

03:13.455 --> 03:15.522
<i>- I know.
- Yeah, that's kinda...
kinda what you said to me.</i>

03:15.524 --> 03:17.891
<i>- I'm sorry. I know.
- You and me.</i>

03:17.893 --> 03:19.858
<i>- I'm sorry.
- You know what,
I'm just, like...</i>

03:19.860 --> 03:23.061
- I took time off
to come up here.
- Do you wanna punch me?

03:23.063 --> 03:25.230
I have a really
crazy life right now, okay?

03:25.232 --> 03:28.467
<i>I don't have the time,
energy, interest...</i>

03:28.469 --> 03:30.235
<i>- Give me just
a slap in the face.
- In, like, dealing with</i>

03:30.237 --> 03:32.871
- all of this shit, okay?
- But it's gonna be so good.

03:32.873 --> 03:35.307
You can say my name, Abby.
You're not gonna fucking
get leprosy.

03:35.309 --> 03:37.509
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys, guys.
- Thanks, Lou. Thank you.

03:37.511 --> 03:41.512
Hello? Guys, this is
gonna be so great.

03:41.514 --> 03:44.448
- We're here.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

03:44.450 --> 03:46.117
So you guys have
a really great weekend,
though.

03:46.119 --> 03:47.985
It was great to see you both,
honestly.

03:50.088 --> 03:52.223
I'm sorry.
I'm with Abby
on this one.

03:52.225 --> 03:54.826
Seriously, like, I hear
where you're coming from
and you're sweet,

03:54.828 --> 03:56.294
but it's, like,
it's not a good call, man.

03:56.296 --> 03:58.529
It's like...

03:58.531 --> 04:01.264
Great.
Let's just...

04:03.434 --> 04:04.968
We'll do it another time.

04:07.338 --> 04:09.005
I have cancer.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.947
What?

04:16.949 --> 04:19.182
I didn't wanna say anything.
I didn't wanna ruin the trip.

04:19.184 --> 04:21.184
I didn't want it to be
about that. I wanted it
to be about us.

04:24.187 --> 04:27.256
- They say four to six months.
- What?!

04:27.258 --> 04:30.192
They say four to six months,
but seriously, I've come
to terms with it.

04:30.194 --> 04:31.994
<i>It's okay.</i>

04:31.996 --> 04:34.630
It's okay.
The thing that I want most,

04:34.632 --> 04:37.299
more than anything
in the world,

04:37.301 --> 04:40.336
<i>is to have this final hurrah,</i>

04:40.338 --> 04:42.904
just the three of us together.

04:47.209 --> 04:49.377
Can we do that?

04:51.046 --> 04:52.647
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
-  Can we do that?</i>

04:52.649 --> 04:53.615
<i>- Of course.
- Yes, yeah.</i>

04:53.617 --> 04:56.317
Can we do that?
Yes, we can?

04:56.319 --> 04:58.519
- Yes, yes.
- Seriously, can we do that?

05:02.057 --> 05:03.357
'Cause I'm just
riddled with it,
you know?

05:05.460 --> 05:07.928
Just... it's everywhere.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.965
What?

05:11.967 --> 05:14.635
- Are you fucking
with me right now?

05:14.637 --> 05:18.372
<i>- I know...
- You don't have
fucking cancer?</i>

05:18.374 --> 05:22.142
No... I do not
have cancer,

05:22.144 --> 05:25.645
- oh, my God.
- But I do have a very good...

05:25.647 --> 05:27.280
- oh, my God.
You're such an asshole.
- Did you just say that you

05:27.282 --> 05:29.215
- have cancer so that we...
- That you guys... you...

05:29.217 --> 05:30.616
<i>- I don't have cancer.
- Are you serious?</i>

05:30.618 --> 05:32.018
<i>- Oh...
- But the thing is...</i>

05:32.020 --> 05:34.020
look it, you guys.
That was bad.

05:34.022 --> 05:36.222
That was a bad,
bad thing to say and do.

05:36.224 --> 05:38.057
That was a horrible thing
to say!

05:38.059 --> 05:40.426
<i>That was a horrible thing
to do, but here's the thing:</i>

05:40.428 --> 05:43.596
<i>We are all dying.
That's the truth.</i>

05:43.598 --> 05:47.432
<i>We have no idea
what's gonna happen.
We don't know.</i>

05:47.434 --> 05:50.602
We could be hit by a bus
tomorrow, you know?

05:50.604 --> 05:53.004
- We could... we have no idea
what's gonna happen.
- Oh, my God.

05:53.006 --> 05:56.174
And I'll tell you one thing
for certain... there are no
buses on that island.

05:56.176 --> 05:59.311
- Okay.
- You know, so we can go out
there and be safe from buses,

05:59.313 --> 06:01.613
- which is great.
- I still, like... I can't...

06:01.615 --> 06:03.381
- shit is great.
- You're such a...

06:03.383 --> 06:05.249
<i>- i want us back.
-  This is so bad.</i>

06:05.251 --> 06:07.518
- Say yes.
- Oh, God.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.087
- You were looking at me like,
"yeah, you're so in."
- You're an asshole.

06:10.089 --> 06:12.222
Say yes, abs.
Is it a yes?

06:12.224 --> 06:14.491
- I'm going, but I'm not happy.
- Yay!

06:17.429 --> 06:19.330
- I love you.
- I hate you.

06:19.332 --> 06:23.167
Yay, let's go camping!
It's gonna be so good, guys.

06:24.536 --> 06:27.370
Fresh air, you know?

06:27.372 --> 06:29.172
New beginnings.

06:29.174 --> 06:30.206
Fresh start.

06:48.758 --> 06:52.394
There she is, guys.
What a beauty.

06:54.630 --> 06:56.198
- Wow.
- First-class travel.

07:00.436 --> 07:03.038
Pass me some stuff.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.374
<i>Do you even know
how to start this motor?</i>

07:05.376 --> 07:07.109
I mean, I think so.

07:07.111 --> 07:09.043
That's got sunglasses.

07:09.045 --> 07:11.612
Oh, sorry.

07:15.717 --> 07:17.685
I have got this.

07:20.689 --> 07:23.657
Hi.
It's a really big knot.

07:25.193 --> 07:27.261
- Let me give you a hand.
- Thank you.

07:27.263 --> 07:30.163
- You're welcome.
- And that's how it's done,
ladies.

07:31.565 --> 07:33.366
- You got it?
- Ta-da.

07:33.368 --> 07:35.135
- Here we go.
- Let's do this.

07:38.139 --> 07:40.106
Here we go, guys.

08:56.847 --> 08:59.415
- More to the left?
- To the right.

08:59.417 --> 09:01.283
- To the right?
- There's a rock right here.

09:01.285 --> 09:03.219
Yeah.

09:03.221 --> 09:05.588
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

09:05.590 --> 09:07.556
Oh, my God.
I don't wanna.

09:07.558 --> 09:10.726
- Oh, my God! Abby!
- Oh, my God.

09:10.728 --> 09:12.360
It was too soon.

09:12.362 --> 09:14.596
- I'm soaked.
- Wow.

09:14.598 --> 09:17.465
- Well done, woman.
- Yeah.

09:17.467 --> 09:20.335
Oh, my God.

09:20.337 --> 09:22.837
- Oh, my God.
- Maybe you need to
just dry off a little bit?

09:22.839 --> 09:26.141
Yeah, you think?
Oh, my God.

09:28.777 --> 09:33.247
- I have my smiley face on,
I have my smiley face on.
- You're good.

09:33.249 --> 09:34.781
You guys did a really good job.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.850
It was a really good job.
Look at that.

09:36.852 --> 09:39.353
Oh, you're one
of the greats,
Sarah.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.758
Did I mention that the water

09:44.760 --> 09:47.761
was actually really,
really, really cold?

09:47.763 --> 09:49.630
- Yup.
- Oh.

09:53.268 --> 09:56.202
- Oh, my God.
- How nice is it, though, guys?

09:56.204 --> 09:57.637
Look at... I mean,
look at the view,
though.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.739
- I know.
- It's so beautiful.

09:59.741 --> 10:02.375
It smells exactly the same.

10:02.377 --> 10:04.544
It smells like childhood to me.

10:04.546 --> 10:08.514
<i>Does anyone mind if I,
like, check my phone
really quick?</i>

10:08.516 --> 10:10.816
Is that, like,
gonna kill the mood?

10:10.818 --> 10:13.719
- No, do it.
Do what you gotta do.
- 'Kay.

10:13.721 --> 10:16.488
Urgent text situation.

10:16.490 --> 10:19.391
No, just addicted to my phone.

10:19.393 --> 10:22.961
Lol.
Omg.

10:22.963 --> 10:24.296
I don't even think
people say that anymore.

10:26.199 --> 10:28.500
Aw.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.535
Whatever.

10:30.537 --> 10:33.638
I don't care.
There's no reception.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.406
I'm totally fine with it.

10:37.475 --> 10:39.276
What are we gonna do
while we're here?

10:39.278 --> 10:42.680
Is this it?

10:42.682 --> 10:44.982
It's not it, is it?

10:44.984 --> 10:49.353
<i>- No?
- I have a plan.</i>

10:49.355 --> 10:51.722
<i>- Like... like a Sarah plan?
- Wow, wait a second. Hold up.</i>

10:51.724 --> 10:55.359
- Sarah has a plan?
- Of course Sarah has a plan.

10:55.361 --> 10:57.794
Okay.

10:57.796 --> 11:00.863
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
Okay.

11:00.865 --> 11:02.632
- Okay, guys.
Close your eyes.
- Okay.

11:05.402 --> 11:07.537
Keep 'em closed.

11:07.539 --> 11:09.772
We are

11:09.774 --> 11:11.774
walking down the stairs...

11:11.776 --> 11:13.977
- very dark, dark,
dark stairs...
- I'm scared.

11:13.979 --> 11:16.512
Into a basement.

11:16.514 --> 11:18.380
And there's Greg sr.

11:18.382 --> 11:20.515
And he's there
with all his friends.

11:20.517 --> 11:22.918
- We take... come on.
- I'm sorry.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.586
We take him out, we sit down,

11:24.588 --> 11:27.256
- and we watch a hundred times...
- "Goonies."

11:27.258 --> 11:30.459
- "Goonies"!
- Oh, my God.
You're such a dork.

11:30.461 --> 11:32.861
- You brought the map
to the time capsule.
- Yes!

11:32.863 --> 11:35.264
- Oh, boy. Here we go.
- Just hold on.

11:35.266 --> 11:37.032
You did it.

11:37.034 --> 11:39.834
- One for you, madam.
- Oh, we each get our own.

11:39.836 --> 11:41.936
- One for you, missy.
- I'm excited.

11:41.938 --> 11:43.771
- This is gonna help us.
- So guys, look.

11:43.773 --> 11:47.408
- Was this it?
- This is it.

11:47.410 --> 11:48.609
- Seriously?
- This is so awesome, dude.

11:48.611 --> 11:50.411
This is our map.

11:50.413 --> 11:53.314
- Look it. We are here.
- No, I get that we are here,

11:53.316 --> 11:56.584
but, like, this isn't
gonna take us anywhere.

11:56.586 --> 11:58.985
- Yeah, it is.
- Do you see what this
is showing us?

11:58.987 --> 12:00.620
- Yes. No, it's pretty
self-explanatory.
- No.

12:00.622 --> 12:02.589
- This is us.
- Oh, obviously.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.924
- This is
Sheila Beal's tits. Remember?
- And you take four dashes

12:04.926 --> 12:08.061
- to the left and then you're at
the fort and the time capsule.
- Right.

12:08.063 --> 12:11.064
I've checked it out.
I mean, the coordinates
are right.

12:11.066 --> 12:13.700
I mean, generally.

12:13.702 --> 12:16.469
- We were 10.
- I know, but it's
gonna be great.

12:16.471 --> 12:19.438
- Abby, dude. Don't poo-poo it.
- Seriously, think of it like
an adventure, you guys.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.940
Lou, dude. I'm good.
I'm just questioning
the, uh...

12:21.942 --> 12:25.744
I hear that,
but it's great,
Sarah.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.047
Sarah, this is great.
Let's do it.

12:28.049 --> 12:29.982
- Yeah?
- Yes.

12:29.984 --> 12:32.017
- Yeah?
- Hey, I am down.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.819
- I am so pumped.
- Let's do it, you guys.
Let's find it.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.487
- Serious.
- So...

12:35.489 --> 12:37.923
- Let's go.
- But I am still so wet.

12:37.925 --> 12:41.693
- I think it's northeast
and then that means...
- No, it's definitely northeast.

13:01.045 --> 13:02.679
- She was really beautiful.
- Remember her?

13:02.681 --> 13:04.748
I can't hear you, Sarah.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.084
Sasha. The girl that was
really pretty in school.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.685
- The exchange student.
She's gay.
- Yeah.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.921
- What?
- She's gay now.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.989
- I know.
- But then I was thinking
maybe, like...

13:12.991 --> 13:15.926
- I don't know.
I'd make out with her.
- I know.

13:15.928 --> 13:17.627
I was, like,
if I had to
go gay, like,

13:17.629 --> 13:20.464
Sasha Warren would be
the girl, right?

13:20.466 --> 13:24.033
- Where is she from?
- It was like Ukraine
or something.

13:24.035 --> 13:29.438
<i> Yeah, I mean, I think it's just, like...
northeast is straight up into...</i>

13:29.440 --> 13:32.842
<i>- just gonna go up into this..
-  No, it was Denmark.</i>

13:32.844 --> 13:35.044
<i>- Oh, fuck. Denmark.
-  Yeah.</i>

13:35.046 --> 13:37.880
- I just... I just remembered.
- I just feel like all Danish
are just, like...

13:37.882 --> 13:39.882
but the truth is,
like, you just...

13:39.884 --> 13:41.884
like, I would be fine
with, like, smooching,

13:41.886 --> 13:44.719
but, like,
I don't know
if I could, like,

13:44.721 --> 13:47.922
- you know, go the whole hog.
- There's the tree.

13:47.924 --> 13:50.658
Oh, the tree
that looks like
Abby taking a dump.

13:50.660 --> 13:54.429
You guys,
it doesn't even
look like that at all.

13:54.431 --> 13:56.664
It's just,
like, it's a tree...
it's a stump.

13:56.666 --> 13:59.100
No, but it's definitely
like a... um...

13:59.102 --> 14:01.603
- It's like a bent-over shape.
- Silhouette.

14:20.455 --> 14:22.790
Guys, I think we should
just throw it in.

14:22.792 --> 14:24.891
We're not gonna find
this fucking fort.

14:24.893 --> 14:28.461
- No, I think it's...
- It's just... yeah, that's part
of the adventure, Abby.

14:28.463 --> 14:30.963
- Just go with it.
- Well, it was really fun
when we were 10,

14:30.965 --> 14:32.999
<i>but now I'm just getting
eaten alive by mosquitos.</i>

14:33.001 --> 14:34.567
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

14:34.569 --> 14:36.569
- Huh?
- Not you. You.

14:36.571 --> 14:37.937
You're rolling
your eyes at me,
what?

14:37.939 --> 14:41.641
- Um...
- What is your problem?

14:41.643 --> 14:44.609
<i>- I don't have a problem, Abby
- I'm sensing a serious
attitude here.</i>

14:44.611 --> 14:46.878
- What is going... what?
- You are honestly
sensing attitude

14:46.880 --> 14:49.481
<i>- from me at this point?
- Mm-hmm. I am.</i>

14:49.483 --> 14:51.550
- I...
- You know, you don't need
Sarah's permission

14:51.552 --> 14:53.718
to just tell me
what's on your mind.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.755
Abby, please.
Like, let's just...

14:56.757 --> 14:58.557
we're out here, you know,

14:58.559 --> 15:00.892
it's so fucking beautiful,
right?

15:00.894 --> 15:02.861
<i>I mean, we haven't
been here in so long.</i>

15:02.863 --> 15:05.729
Look, Sarah doesn't have cancer.
That's good. That's...

15:05.731 --> 15:08.065
<i>- Like, let's go
have some fun.
- I agree.</i>

15:08.067 --> 15:10.000
I think we should
just keep going.

15:10.002 --> 15:11.869
I wanna know
what the fuck
your problem is, Lou.

15:11.871 --> 15:14.004
Oh, my God.
Are we really
gonna do this?

15:14.006 --> 15:15.206
Do what?

15:17.876 --> 15:20.511
Abigail, come on.
It was fucking ages ago
and I apologized.

15:20.513 --> 15:22.813
Oh, no, no, no.
I wasn't even talking
about that.

15:22.815 --> 15:25.216
<i>- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I'm totally over it.
I'm great.</i>

15:25.218 --> 15:27.717
You're clearly not over it.
Can we just call that out?

15:27.719 --> 15:29.686
<i>- You are the one
that brought it up.
- I brought it up</i>

15:29.688 --> 15:31.788
because you are making it
very difficult for us to just,

15:31.790 --> 15:33.756
like, have a nice time
right now.

15:33.758 --> 15:36.493
Because of some stupid
indiscretion that happened,
like, six years ago.

15:36.495 --> 15:38.194
- Oh, is that how
you see that?
- Yes.

15:38.196 --> 15:40.697
You really see
fucking my boyfriend
of two years...

15:40.699 --> 15:43.132
the guy who I was pretty sure
I was probably gonna marry
maybe someday...

15:43.134 --> 15:45.902
<i>you thought that was just
a small, stupid indiscretion?</i>

15:45.904 --> 15:48.871
We were children at that point
and we were both fucking drunk
and the guy was,

15:48.873 --> 15:51.907
honestly, like
a class-a douchebag.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.076
Like, you should be thanking me
that you didn't walk down
the aisle with that guy.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.777
All right, well, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

15:55.779 --> 15:58.080
Thank you so much, Lou,
for fucking my boyfriend.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.048
- I don't mean it like...
- I appreciate it with all of...

16:00.050 --> 16:01.950
- I feel really badly about it.
- You were my best friend

16:01.952 --> 16:03.285
and if you're calling him
a douchebag,

16:03.287 --> 16:05.787
I would love to know
what the fuck that makes you.

16:05.789 --> 16:08.823
<i>I don't even know
why we're talking about it
still at this point</i>

16:08.825 --> 16:11.192
because you have
this amazing life.

16:11.194 --> 16:13.127
You're fucking married.
You're married.

16:13.129 --> 16:16.130
Don't... don't talk like
you know anything about
my life right now.

16:16.132 --> 16:18.299
- You are not a part
of my life, Lou.
- Why even...

16:18.301 --> 16:20.568
- you have not been a part of my
life for a really long time.
- That is your doing.

16:20.570 --> 16:22.136
- And do you wanna know why?
- That's your doing.

16:22.138 --> 16:25.039
Because you never,
ever apologized.

16:25.041 --> 16:29.042
- I have apologized
to you thousands of times...
- You said you were sorry

16:29.044 --> 16:31.745
<i>- and you never meant it!
Never!
- What?!</i>

16:31.747 --> 16:34.314
<i>- You would look at me like
I was stupid and overreacting
- Just can't win.</i>

16:34.316 --> 16:36.783
- And taking it too far.
- You took a fucking
sledgehammer...

16:36.785 --> 16:38.285
<i>- yeah, I wanted to take it
to your goddamn fucking face!
- You fucking threw it...</i>

16:38.287 --> 16:40.587
- okay, guys!
- You wanna go in...

16:40.589 --> 16:42.055
- yes! I would love to fucking
smash your face in!
- Guys, guys, guys!

16:42.057 --> 16:45.325
- No, if there's a time
to do it, do it now.
-  No.

16:45.327 --> 16:47.127
- Guys, stop it.
- I would love to, Lou.

16:47.129 --> 16:48.695
- All right, well,
then, bring it.
- Please.

16:48.697 --> 16:50.329
- Great.
- Stop it, guys.
This is crazy.

16:50.331 --> 16:54.667
- Just take a fucking time-out.
- I agree that it's crazy.

16:54.669 --> 16:56.802
- Great, I'm the crazy one.
- Guys, please, please, please,

16:56.804 --> 16:58.804
- just stop.
- I'm a crazy fucking bitch.

16:58.806 --> 17:01.006
Dude... I know.
I mean, this is
just, like...

17:01.008 --> 17:04.042
- this is just... cannot.
- She started it.

17:04.045 --> 17:07.846
Can I say that?
Let's go, let's go
chase Abby

17:07.848 --> 17:09.814
'cause she's got a problem.

17:18.357 --> 17:21.192
<i>I feel like
all three of us in this tent
is not gonna be good.</i>

17:21.194 --> 17:23.127
All things considered.

17:23.128 --> 17:23.929
I know.

17:28.099 --> 17:31.168
<i>I mean, obviously this went
a lot different in my head.</i>

17:31.170 --> 17:33.870
- You know, we were
having fun and...
- I know.

17:33.872 --> 17:36.039
- I'm sorry.
- This is so crazy

17:36.041 --> 17:37.941
because when I think about
the three of us,

17:37.943 --> 17:39.743
like, back in the day...

17:39.745 --> 17:43.380
I feel like
we were the crazy ones
and she was, like, sweet.

17:43.382 --> 17:45.983
- She was sweet Abby
and now she's crazy Abby.
- She has been acting

17:45.985 --> 17:48.185
really... I don't know.
She's just been off.

17:48.187 --> 17:50.787
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

17:50.789 --> 17:54.256
She just doesn't wanna talk
about it, which, as you know,
for Abby, is really weird.

17:54.258 --> 17:56.258
Yeah.
Jesus.

18:00.631 --> 18:03.199
I mean, the truth is,
though, what happened
was pretty fucked up.

18:03.201 --> 18:05.835
- Yeah, I know, Sarah. I know.
- Yeah, I know you know.

18:05.837 --> 18:07.770
I know you know
and I'm not trying
to take sides,

18:07.772 --> 18:10.139
- but I'm just... Lou,
I'm trying to put a certain
- Oh, my God.

18:10.141 --> 18:12.641
Perspective on it
where I'm looking at
someone over there

18:12.643 --> 18:14.709
who's really,
really, really hurt.

18:14.711 --> 18:17.412
And I know for you,
you were young and whatever
and you're...

18:17.414 --> 18:20.949
- yeah.
- I know and you've moved
past it and I can look at it

18:20.951 --> 18:23.852
and I can be past it,
but it didn't happen to me.

18:23.854 --> 18:26.021
Like, I think for her,
it was a game changer.

18:37.166 --> 18:38.932
Okay, um...

18:41.202 --> 18:43.170
Excuse me.

19:17.904 --> 19:20.839
So...

19:20.841 --> 19:23.775
I'm just gonna...

19:23.777 --> 19:25.744
I'm just gonna sit here...

19:28.715 --> 19:30.482
And...

19:32.985 --> 19:34.985
You can say
whatever you
wanna say to me.

19:37.222 --> 19:38.989
You wanna call me names or...

19:41.426 --> 19:43.861
Get up in my face.

19:43.863 --> 19:45.196
- I'm just gonna sit here.

19:45.198 --> 19:46.831
<i>What?!  What?!</i>

19:46.833 --> 19:48.399
- Whoa, whoa.
- What the fuck is that? Fuck!

19:48.401 --> 19:50.201
<i>- What is that?
-  What is it, what is it?</i>

19:50.203 --> 19:52.303
- Nothing, it's nothing.
- Three hunters up there.

19:52.305 --> 19:54.438
<i>-  Are you guys all right?
- Sorry, it was really scary.</i>

19:54.440 --> 19:56.206
- Jesus Christ. Hey.
-  Hey.

19:56.208 --> 19:59.509
<i>- Hi.
- Hey.</i>

19:59.511 --> 20:01.478
Um...

20:05.483 --> 20:07.817
<i>Is that Henry? Is that...
i think I know that guy.</i>

20:07.819 --> 20:10.386
- Shut up.
- Is that Henry Wallace?

20:10.388 --> 20:13.790
- Yeah.
- That is crazy.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.925
You scared
the living shit
out of us.

20:15.927 --> 20:18.427
I, um... I'm Lou.

20:18.429 --> 20:21.096
Louise.
I'm Louise foster.

20:21.098 --> 20:23.799
<i>I went to Milbridge elementary
school together.</i>

20:23.801 --> 20:26.068
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Okay.</i>

20:26.070 --> 20:28.170
- You... you do. Yes, you do.
- I don't know...

20:28.172 --> 20:31.140
Sorry. This is
Abby Turner...
oh, my God.

20:31.142 --> 20:34.009
- And Sarah Whitfield.
- Hi.

20:34.011 --> 20:37.845
We... we went to...
we went to grammar school
with your older brother Jimmy.

20:37.847 --> 20:40.915
We're, like, a couple years
ahead of you. You guys know
it's Jimmy Wallace.

20:40.917 --> 20:42.950
- Jimmy... Jimmy Wallace's
little brother.
- Oh.

20:42.952 --> 20:44.886
- Oh, okay.
Yeah, yeah, Lou... Lou.
- And that's Henry.

20:44.888 --> 20:48.055
- Yeah.
- I think Jim had a crush
on you back then.

20:48.057 --> 20:50.558
- You used to have
the pigtails, right?
- Yeah. I always had the...

20:50.560 --> 20:53.027
wow. Why do you
remember that?
That's bizarre.

20:53.029 --> 20:54.996
Uh, these are my buddies.
This is Derek and Alex.

20:54.998 --> 20:56.898
-  Hey.
-  Hello.

20:56.900 --> 20:59.266
- Hey.
- So... so what are you girls
doing out here anyways?

20:59.268 --> 21:01.101
I mean, nobody
comes out here anymore.

21:01.103 --> 21:03.570
<i>You're lucky you didn't
get shot, you know?</i>

21:03.572 --> 21:06.072
We were shooting deer
not, what, like, 200 yards
from here yesterday?

21:06.074 --> 21:08.208
Is it hunting season?

21:08.210 --> 21:09.843
What?

21:13.381 --> 21:17.250
Well, we are just camping here.

21:17.252 --> 21:20.152
- Yeah.
- Just for a couple
of days and...

21:20.154 --> 21:21.453
what?

21:21.455 --> 21:23.556
How is the hunting going?
Is it good?

21:23.558 --> 21:26.492
It's not too good.

21:26.494 --> 21:28.460
Well, we were,
uh... we were gonna
eat what we killed,

21:28.462 --> 21:31.597
and, uh, well, so far
we ain't ate a thing.

21:31.599 --> 21:33.966
- Oh. Sucks.

21:33.968 --> 21:35.534
<i>-  Yeah.
- All right.</i>

21:35.536 --> 21:37.903
I killed a lot of spaghettios

21:37.905 --> 21:41.472
and we've got a shit ton
of liquor, so...

21:41.474 --> 21:44.242
<i>You guys wanna join us maybe?</i>

21:44.244 --> 21:46.010
Oh, um...

21:48.514 --> 21:51.482
So how is your brother?

21:51.484 --> 21:54.285
Uh, my brother's
good. He's good.

21:54.287 --> 21:57.055
- He's got three kids.
- Oh, man.

21:57.057 --> 22:00.490
- Yeah, and he's still fishing.
- Of course.

22:00.492 --> 22:03.193
- Yeah, we actually took
his boat out here.
- Cool.

22:05.330 --> 22:07.297
Is he still cute?

22:09.033 --> 22:11.535
Um...
Is he still cute?

22:11.537 --> 22:14.104
Well, I mean, he's weighing in
at three bills now, so I...

22:14.106 --> 22:16.473
- what? Are you serious?
- If you're into that
kind of thing.

22:16.475 --> 22:17.574
- Yeah.
- Like where?

22:17.576 --> 22:20.277
That's, like, so fat.

22:20.279 --> 22:22.912
- Didn't you give
him a blowjob?
- Oh, my God.

22:22.914 --> 22:25.381
You totally gave
Jimmy Wallace
a blowjob.

22:25.383 --> 22:28.517
I totally remember that
and was I not supposed
to say it out loud?

22:28.519 --> 22:30.419
- I...
- But she did.

22:30.421 --> 22:32.388
- She did.
- If we're counting.

22:32.390 --> 22:35.224
- It was
a hand job, but, um...
- Hey, so I don't even want

22:35.226 --> 22:37.927
- to interrupt
or anything, but...
- My lips are sealed.

22:37.929 --> 22:39.996
I like your beard.
- Wow.

22:39.998 --> 22:43.031
- I do. I like this whole thing.
- Thank you.

22:43.033 --> 22:45.200
- It's very sexy.
- Thank you very much.

22:45.202 --> 22:48.970
<i>- Very, very très chic.
- Thank you.</i>

22:48.972 --> 22:51.606
You have this
whole look going on

22:51.608 --> 22:53.508
and I gotta tell you,
it works...

22:53.510 --> 22:55.510
- Thanks.
- ...For you.

22:55.512 --> 22:57.512
<i>- Well, it's just kind of...
-  It's very cute.</i>

22:57.514 --> 23:00.115
- I haven't shaved
in a while, you know?
- Yeah, though, it's, like,

23:00.117 --> 23:01.917
effortless.

23:01.919 --> 23:04.618
I mean, seriously.
You should get
one of these

23:04.620 --> 23:07.388
<i>'cause you have a baby face.</i>

23:07.390 --> 23:09.623
- He looks good with a beard.
- But it's, you know...

23:09.625 --> 23:12.059
can you grow a beard?

23:12.061 --> 23:14.328
Well...

23:14.330 --> 23:16.997
- Anyways, your beard is cute
and I like it.
- Thank you.

23:16.999 --> 23:18.599
I like it a lot.

23:18.601 --> 23:22.002
So, listen.
How's your family doing?

23:22.004 --> 23:24.370
They're good, they're good.

23:24.372 --> 23:27.440
My mom and dad actually
moved to Florida recently.

23:27.442 --> 23:30.276
<i>- Oh, right on.
- Which I'm sort of
so-so about, but...</i>

23:30.278 --> 23:32.412
<i>- yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

23:32.414 --> 23:35.148
- No, no, no. That's totally
cool. I mean, you can't...
- Yeah.

23:35.150 --> 23:37.183
You can't blame them for getting
out of these winters and...

23:37.185 --> 23:38.518
<i>- Yeah.
-  I went to Florida one time</i>

23:38.520 --> 23:41.554
and it was really hot.

23:43.357 --> 23:45.357
<i>- It was really hot in Florida
- It's warm, right?</i>

23:45.359 --> 23:46.692
<i>- You go?
- Yeah.</i>

23:46.694 --> 23:51.363
It makes me wanna take
my clothes off.

23:51.365 --> 23:53.966
<i>- Abby.
- It does.</i>

23:53.968 --> 23:58.103
- Abby. Abby.
- You take your clothes off
all the time when it's hot.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.638
<i>- Seriously, I wanna talk
to you for a second.
- Am I wrong?</i>

23:59.640 --> 24:01.540
- Come have a chat
with me in the tent.
- No, I'm so good.

24:01.542 --> 24:03.208
I need to put on
some warming clothes
and I want you to talk to me.

24:03.210 --> 24:05.209
You should put on
some warming clothes.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.211
I'm going to put on some
warming clothes, but I wanna
tell you a secret as well.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.146
- So come here for a second.
- Shh.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.548
- Secrets.
- Secrets.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.117
- I'm coming back.
- Right on.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.157
- What?
- What's going on?

24:20.159 --> 24:22.693
What do you mean
what is going on?
Nothing.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.695
- What do you mean nothing?
- I'm talking to Lou.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.630
what are you doing with Henry?
'Cause that's...

24:27.632 --> 24:29.632
<i>- he's so cute.
- Dude, come on.</i>

24:29.634 --> 24:33.036
I mean, he's so young.
Like, don't you miss that...
being, like...

24:33.038 --> 24:35.038
Abby, you're married.
You know what I mean?

24:35.040 --> 24:36.573
- You know what?
Don't even.
- I'm just...

24:36.575 --> 24:38.475
- I'm just trying
to protect you
- No, no, no, no.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.210
As a friend
because it's, like...

24:40.212 --> 24:43.179
Mike... nonissue, okay?

24:43.181 --> 24:45.115
- I don't want you
to worry about it.
- What does that even mean?

24:45.117 --> 24:46.715
- I am so good.
- Dude, what is...

24:46.717 --> 24:48.684
<i>dude, what does that even mean,
it's a nonissue?</i>

24:48.686 --> 24:50.686
I just mean,
don't worry about it.

24:50.688 --> 24:53.122
- It's all good. This is so fun.
Thank you so much.
- Abby, Abby, Abby.

24:53.124 --> 24:54.456
<i>- Thank you so much.
- Fuck.</i>

24:54.458 --> 24:57.593
I don't know.
Where... whereabouts did...

24:57.595 --> 24:59.495
- uh, Ver... Vero beach.
- Guess who?

24:59.497 --> 25:02.331
- Um, I'm gonna go
with Abby on this one.
- Guess who?

25:02.333 --> 25:05.100
Guess who?
It's so Abby.

25:05.102 --> 25:07.035
- Hi.
- It was totally me.

25:07.037 --> 25:08.269
- Yeah, I know.
- It was totally me.

25:08.271 --> 25:10.138
- I'm good at that.
- So me.

25:10.140 --> 25:12.573
<i>- I'm having so much fun.
- I'm glad.</i>

25:12.575 --> 25:14.475
<i>- I don't have... this is fun.
- What's going on?</i>

25:14.477 --> 25:15.777
<i>I just... I love this.</i>

25:15.779 --> 25:18.146
- God, Lou.
- Cheers.

25:18.148 --> 25:20.448
- Yeah?
- You look older, but, like...
you look... you're still you,

25:20.450 --> 25:22.450
- and I love that.
- Thanks.

25:22.452 --> 25:24.819
- So happy.
- Abby.

25:24.821 --> 25:27.821
- I'm so happy.
- So the wood situation is low.

25:27.823 --> 25:30.390
Maybe we should beef it up.

25:30.392 --> 25:32.426
- You guys need
some wood? I can go...
- Yeah, I can go.

25:32.428 --> 25:33.693
- No, no, no.
I have no problem.
- No, no.

25:33.695 --> 25:35.395
- Do you wanna go...
- No.

25:35.397 --> 25:37.831
- Use me. I can go get wood.
- No, I am... here's the deal.

25:37.833 --> 25:40.634
- I got wood before.
- Okay.

25:40.636 --> 25:43.070
'Kay, 'cause I'm,
like, a wood expert

25:43.072 --> 25:45.539
and I know there's
all these secret spots.

25:45.541 --> 25:47.707
I have a flashlight

25:47.709 --> 25:49.742
- and I know the secret spots.
- Honestly, I don't mind
going by myself.

25:49.744 --> 25:52.278
- I know. It's fine.
- Hi.

25:52.280 --> 25:55.848
- Gonna go, gonna go, gonna go.
- Awesome. Be careful out there.

25:55.850 --> 25:57.783
- I'm gonna be so careful.
- You'll be good.

25:57.785 --> 26:00.186
- I'm gonna be so careful,
it's gonna be crazy.
- Take a walk...

26:00.188 --> 26:02.788
just walk it off.

26:02.790 --> 26:04.090
- I'll be back, though.
- She knows her stuff.

26:04.092 --> 26:05.424
Okay.

26:05.426 --> 26:08.794
- Wow, she's friendly.
- She is friendly.

26:08.796 --> 26:10.695
That is something that she is.

26:10.697 --> 26:13.098
It's fine. You know,
she seems harmless

26:13.100 --> 26:15.200
and, you know, just having fun.

26:15.202 --> 26:17.802
- Do you need another drink?
I feel like that might...
- No, yeah.

26:17.804 --> 26:20.271
I'm getting a little low.
That'd be great.

26:20.273 --> 26:21.639
A little Sandy.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.151
Um... a little Sandy,
but there you go.

26:34.153 --> 26:36.120
Oh, no worries.
It's perfect.
Thank you.

26:36.122 --> 26:39.356
So where do you guys...
where do you guys all know
each other from?

26:39.358 --> 26:41.358
Uh...

26:41.360 --> 26:45.362
<i>I mean, we were all...
we all served together.</i>

26:45.364 --> 26:49.233
- Like, you...
- We all served in
the military together in,

26:49.235 --> 26:51.701
<i>- uh, the army.
- Oh, I didn't realize that.</i>

26:51.703 --> 26:56.539
Where'd you...
like, where'd you...
how would I say that?

26:56.541 --> 26:58.808
You know, I'm sorry.
Excuse me. I'm gonna go
take a leak.

26:58.810 --> 27:00.843
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, right on.

27:00.845 --> 27:02.612
- Yeah.
- Do whatever
you gotta do.

27:13.456 --> 27:15.657
So you guys were...
you guys served together?

27:15.659 --> 27:18.460
- Yup.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:18.462 --> 27:21.296
Two deployments Iraq,
one in Afghanistan.

27:21.298 --> 27:24.332
Right on.

27:24.334 --> 27:26.635
Um, how long ago?

27:26.637 --> 27:30.172
How long have you guys...
how long ago were
you guys there?

27:30.174 --> 27:33.507
- We've been back,
what, three weeks now?
- 18 days.

27:33.509 --> 27:36.677
<i>- 18 days?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

27:36.679 --> 27:38.812
- That's crazy.
- I didn't think
you were gonna say that.

27:38.814 --> 27:40.848
<i>-  That is...
-  Not long at all.</i>

27:40.850 --> 27:43.450
<i>No, that's... wow.</i>

27:47.722 --> 27:49.757
That's crazy.

27:53.661 --> 27:55.628
Hey, where are you?

27:57.331 --> 27:59.465
Hey, psst.

27:59.467 --> 28:01.401
Where'd you go?

28:01.403 --> 28:03.670
Hey. Where did you go?

28:03.672 --> 28:06.272
- I got you.
- You got me.

28:06.274 --> 28:07.740
- Shh.
- What?

28:07.742 --> 28:09.642
- Why?
- 'Cause I have a secret.

28:09.644 --> 28:11.411
- What's your secret?
- Come here.

28:26.593 --> 28:28.927
Oh, wow.
You really taste good.

28:28.929 --> 28:31.763
Oh.

28:31.765 --> 28:33.465
- See, man.
- It's been awhile.

28:33.467 --> 28:35.333
- I still got it.
- Yeah.

28:35.335 --> 28:37.568
- I got this, man.
- Yeah, you got this.

28:37.570 --> 28:39.971
- I am not an uptight bitch.
- No, no, no.

28:39.973 --> 28:42.673
- I'm fun, right?
- Yeah, you're a lot of fun.

28:42.675 --> 28:44.275
- Fun.
- Hey.

28:44.277 --> 28:46.277
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna have fun?

28:46.279 --> 28:48.546
Kind of.

28:52.751 --> 28:54.719
Mm.

28:55.987 --> 28:58.822
- You know, I, um...
- What?

28:58.824 --> 29:01.992
- I don't feel great...
- Wait, wait, wait.

29:01.994 --> 29:04.394
And I think maybe
I should go down
to the beach

29:04.396 --> 29:05.629
- and get...
- What happened
to having fun, Abby?

29:05.631 --> 29:07.831
Oh, no.
That was so fun.
So fun.

29:10.735 --> 29:13.470
I feel like...
I wanna know
what I am, you know?

29:14.905 --> 29:16.772
- Fuck.

29:16.774 --> 29:18.540
- Ow. God, Henry.
- Are you all right?

29:18.542 --> 29:20.309
- It hurt.
- Sorry, I slipped.

29:26.383 --> 29:29.051
Henry wouldn't
tell you this,
but he...

29:29.053 --> 29:30.953
I mean, he'd deny it.

29:30.955 --> 29:33.422
Just flat out, but he
saved both our lives.

29:35.058 --> 29:37.825
Hell, he saved
the whole squad
in Helmand province.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.331
Wow.

29:45.734 --> 29:47.702
<i>What happened?</i>

29:51.540 --> 29:54.309
We got, uh...

29:54.311 --> 29:56.477
we came up on a bunker
that we thought
was abandoned

29:56.479 --> 29:58.879
and it was just a bad report.

29:58.881 --> 30:00.814
<i>Before we knew it,
we were just...</i>

30:03.418 --> 30:05.485
Getting shot at.

30:05.487 --> 30:07.587
- Shit.
- Henry Wallace.

30:07.589 --> 30:08.989
- Yeah.
- You know, like,
little Henry Wallace.

30:08.991 --> 30:10.857
I... I...

30:10.859 --> 30:14.661
usually when you hear
about a local hero,

30:14.663 --> 30:17.531
you see it in the headlines,
and I just had no idea.

30:17.533 --> 30:20.366
<i>- I didn't hear
anything about that.
- Yeah, well.</i>

30:20.368 --> 30:23.969
<i>- I would have heard about him.
- Our superiors didn't really
approve of our tactics.</i>

30:25.972 --> 30:29.575
Sometimes you can't
go by the book,
you know?

30:29.577 --> 30:32.812
I mean, you can't
follow every single rule.

30:32.814 --> 30:34.880
Shit gets outta hand.

30:34.882 --> 30:37.049
You gotta do
what you gotta do
to get the job done.

30:44.090 --> 30:46.091
They sent us back home...

30:46.093 --> 30:47.992
Dishonorable discharge.

30:49.729 --> 30:51.796
<i>No fucking medals.</i>

30:51.798 --> 30:53.465
No shit.

30:53.467 --> 30:56.601
But I'll tell you what.

30:56.603 --> 31:00.070
The fucking government...
they may not say it,

31:00.072 --> 31:02.139
but, Henry, boy,

31:02.141 --> 31:03.741
he's still a fucking hero.

31:03.743 --> 31:05.008
Fuck, yeah, he is.

31:10.115 --> 31:12.649
I...

31:12.651 --> 31:15.018
oh, Henry, stop.
Can you get off?

31:15.020 --> 31:17.688
Can you just get off me
for a second?

31:17.690 --> 31:20.424
- Just get off me.
- Oh, no.

31:20.426 --> 31:21.624
Get off me, Henry.

31:27.131 --> 31:29.899
- You wanna have some
fucking fun, baby?

31:29.901 --> 31:31.768
All right,
let's have some
fucking fun.

31:31.770 --> 31:33.069
What do you think
about this, huh?

31:33.071 --> 31:35.037
You wanna get fucked tonight?

31:35.039 --> 31:38.074
Are you ready to get fucked?
Do you wanna have some
fucking fun?

31:38.076 --> 31:40.843
Let's have some fucking fun,
you little bitch.

31:42.979 --> 31:45.414
<i>Help, you guys!</i>

31:45.416 --> 31:46.748
<i>- What the fuck?
-  Abby.</i>

31:46.750 --> 31:48.817
What the hell was that?

31:48.819 --> 31:51.486
Guys!

31:51.488 --> 31:53.522
- Help me! Help me...
- What the fuck?

31:53.524 --> 31:55.190
- Abby?
- Henry?

31:55.192 --> 31:56.892
- What's going on?
What happened?
- Jesus fucking...

31:56.894 --> 31:58.593
roll him.
Get him over gentle.

31:58.595 --> 32:00.429
- What happened?
- Henry, Henry.

32:00.431 --> 32:02.130
- What is it?
- Henry, what's
the matter with you?

32:02.132 --> 32:05.966
- Get the fuck away from him.
- You fucking...

32:05.968 --> 32:08.769
what'd you fucking do?!
What'd you do to him?!

32:08.771 --> 32:10.538
- Can you hear me, Henry?
- What happened, what happened?

32:10.540 --> 32:12.573
- Is he hurt?
- Henry, it's Derek.

32:12.575 --> 32:15.042
- Keep your fucking
eyes open, okay?
- Listen, listen. Hey, hey.

32:15.044 --> 32:17.478
- Keep your eyes open.
That's good. That's good.
- Hey, man.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.146
- Hey, man. We're gonna
get you some help.
- Don't close them.

32:19.148 --> 32:21.449
<i>- Henry, don't fucking
close your eyes!
- What?</i>

32:21.451 --> 32:23.983
Don't do that,
don't do that, man.
We'll get help for you, man.

32:23.985 --> 32:26.453
- Henry, Henry!
- Don't fucking die on me, man!

32:26.455 --> 32:29.155
<i>- Open your fucking eyes, man.
Open your eyes.
- Oh, shit.</i>

32:29.157 --> 32:31.724
Oh! Oh!

32:31.726 --> 32:33.593
Henry?

32:34.795 --> 32:36.930
Oh, no.

32:36.932 --> 32:38.898
Fuck, fuck.

32:43.103 --> 32:44.870
- Oh, my God.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.676
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

32:50.678 --> 32:52.044
<i>Derek, man.
What are we gonna do, man?</i>

32:54.147 --> 32:56.114
Derek?

33:01.788 --> 33:05.089
- Get your fucking gun.
- Oh, God.

33:05.091 --> 33:07.625
- What?
- Get your fucking gun.

33:07.627 --> 33:09.160
<i>- What? No.
-  No.</i>

33:09.162 --> 33:11.229
<i>- No, no, no, no.
-  What?</i>

33:11.231 --> 33:13.865
<i>- No, no, no. No, wait.
-  It was an accident.</i>

33:13.867 --> 33:16.601
<i>- Wait, wait, wait.
-  Please, just stop.</i>

33:16.603 --> 33:18.569
<i>- Just...
-  Wait a minute.</i>

33:18.571 --> 33:21.973
Wait. Hang on.

33:21.975 --> 33:25.542
- Please, stop.
- You fucking cunt!

33:25.544 --> 33:27.210
You fucking killed him!

33:29.046 --> 33:31.648
- Fucking run!

33:31.650 --> 33:33.283
This bitch!
I swear to God!

33:35.587 --> 33:37.521
No, no, no!

33:38.890 --> 33:40.891
Wait, wait, wait!
No, no! Stop it!

33:40.893 --> 33:42.959
- Stop! Stop it!

33:52.869 --> 33:55.237
Can you use your head?

33:55.239 --> 33:56.872
Use your fucking head.

34:16.025 --> 34:18.726
Sarah, Sarah.

34:18.728 --> 34:20.695
- Wake up.
- Oh, my God.

34:24.333 --> 34:26.167
<i>Shit.</i>

34:26.168 --> 34:28.869
<i>Lou, Lou.</i>

34:35.710 --> 34:37.143
Part of me wants to
do this shit...

34:37.146 --> 34:38.978
just fucking haji style, bro.

34:38.981 --> 34:41.715
Just saw their
fucking heads off.

34:41.717 --> 34:42.916
Calm the fuck down,
Derek, okay?

34:42.918 --> 34:44.585
Let's just think about this.
Just for a second.

34:44.587 --> 34:46.719
What is there
to fucking think about?

34:46.722 --> 34:48.788
You think I didn't...
you think I didn't want to beat
them to a fucking bloody pulp?

34:48.790 --> 34:50.856
I did!
We both did.

34:50.858 --> 34:52.925
Now all I'm saying

34:52.927 --> 34:55.094
is let's just think
about this, all right?

34:55.096 --> 34:58.831
They're just... they're just
fucking girls, okay?

34:58.833 --> 35:00.700
They're girls.
They're somebody's daughter.

35:00.702 --> 35:02.001
They're somebody's sister.

35:02.003 --> 35:03.936
They're not fucking haji.

35:03.938 --> 35:06.839
That bitch killed Henry.

35:06.841 --> 35:09.941
- Fuck, man.
- He's fucking dead, Alex.

35:11.644 --> 35:13.078
What the fuck do you wanna do?

35:13.080 --> 35:15.981
Never...

35:15.983 --> 35:20.051
We gotta get outta here.
Can you get your hands free?

35:20.053 --> 35:23.355
No.
I'm totally stuck.

35:23.357 --> 35:27.058
- Are you?
- These fucking...

35:27.060 --> 35:28.927
are you ready to die, bitch?

35:31.162 --> 35:33.631
Okay, guys.
I'm gonna talk to him.

35:33.633 --> 35:36.767
<i>- I'm going.
-  What are you gonna say?</i>

35:36.769 --> 35:38.769
<i>I'm just gonna talk to them.</i>

35:38.771 --> 35:41.271
I'm gonna look at 'em
and I'm gonna talk to 'em.

35:46.344 --> 35:49.279
Okay, okay, guys, okay.

35:49.281 --> 35:53.116
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

35:53.118 --> 35:55.084
<i>- Derek, listen.
- Shut up. Shut up.</i>

35:55.086 --> 35:58.221
- What happened to Henry was
a terrible, terrible...
- Shut up.

35:58.223 --> 36:00.256
Fucking mistake, okay?

36:00.258 --> 36:02.659
<i>It was an accident.
Abby is sorry.</i>

36:02.661 --> 36:06.062
She is sorry, but please,

36:06.064 --> 36:10.333
understand that what she did
was protecting herself.

36:10.335 --> 36:13.101
<i>Can you get that?
She thought that he
was going to rape her.</i>

36:13.103 --> 36:15.971
Can you understand that?
Can you get that?

36:15.973 --> 36:17.906
Here's what I get.
Your fucking slut friend

36:17.908 --> 36:19.975
<i>lures my buddy up into
the woods...</i>

36:19.977 --> 36:21.743
<i>flirting with him all night.</i>

36:21.745 --> 36:24.680
<i>Smashes his fucking head in
with a rock.</i>

36:24.682 --> 36:27.916
That's what I understand.

36:27.918 --> 36:30.452
-  Okay, okay. You're right.
-  That's what I understand.

36:30.454 --> 36:32.887
<i>- You're right.
- Okay?</i>

36:32.889 --> 36:35.089
Let's go to the police.
Let's tell them everything...

36:35.091 --> 36:38.726
We'll just...
you can fucking tell them
whatever you want.

36:38.728 --> 36:40.695
<i>Listen to me!
Listen!</i>

36:43.365 --> 36:46.767
Don't cry.
Don't fucking cry.

36:49.072 --> 36:50.905
You fucking pussy.

36:55.276 --> 36:57.043
What did you say?

36:57.045 --> 37:01.114
You gotta tie up three girls
to a tree to kill them?

37:01.116 --> 37:03.850
- I think you're
a fucking pussy!

37:03.852 --> 37:05.985
- If we're gonna do this, man,
let's just fucking do it.
- Hold on a second.

37:05.987 --> 37:07.320
- Let's just fucking do it, man.
- Hold on a second.

37:07.322 --> 37:09.389
Wait, wait.

37:12.993 --> 37:15.060
Do you think I'm scared of you?

37:16.496 --> 37:18.030
Whoa, fuck.

37:26.973 --> 37:28.941
She's got some spunk.

37:30.410 --> 37:32.745
How 'bout you fucking untie me

37:32.747 --> 37:34.479
like a real man?

37:34.481 --> 37:37.415
<i>How 'bout you fucking untie me
and let me show you?!</i>

37:37.417 --> 37:40.451
- I will show you what I can do!
- Shut the fuck up!

37:40.453 --> 37:42.019
- I will show you!
- Shut up!

37:50.362 --> 37:53.131
<i>- This is fucking crazy.
You fucking kidding me?
- Watch this, watch this.</i>

37:53.133 --> 37:55.332
<i>- You're fucking kidding me.
- Watch this.</i>

37:55.334 --> 37:57.100
- You got a move?
- Huh?

37:59.403 --> 38:00.971
- Go!

38:00.973 --> 38:02.539
- Ah!

38:02.541 --> 38:04.374
-  Go! Run!
-  Up the hill!

38:04.376 --> 38:06.843
<i>- Get her up the fucking hill!
-  Go, go!</i>

39:35.963 --> 39:39.331
<i>We been hunting shoddy jihad
for three fucking years.</i>

39:41.367 --> 39:44.903
<i>What the fuck makes you think
this comes out good for you?</i>

40:10.896 --> 40:12.529
- Derek.
- Yeah.

40:12.531 --> 40:14.265
- What the fuck you doing?
- What?

40:14.267 --> 40:15.966
What the fuck is...
why'd you do that?

40:15.968 --> 40:17.935
Why'd you let 'em go, huh?

40:17.937 --> 40:20.070
You said you were
gonna kill 'em and now
we're gonna have to.

40:20.072 --> 40:22.538
- Huh, you fucking moron?
- Jesus, don't worry.

40:22.540 --> 40:25.008
We'll find 'em.

40:25.010 --> 40:27.410
We came out here to hunt.
We'll just hunt 'em down.

40:29.313 --> 40:30.647
Do you hear that?

40:32.483 --> 40:35.218
<i>We're gonna find you!</i>

40:39.590 --> 40:42.190
And I'm gonna kill you!

40:47.063 --> 40:49.031
It's on.

41:43.516 --> 41:46.051
I'm gonna kill
all three of you!

41:46.053 --> 41:49.388
<i>One by one!</i>

41:49.390 --> 41:53.125
<i>With my bare fucking hands
if I have to!</i>

44:53.464 --> 44:56.599
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, God, you guys.

44:59.570 --> 45:01.471
I didn't think
I was gonna see
you guys again.

45:01.473 --> 45:03.573
- We're alive.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

45:03.575 --> 45:04.741
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

45:04.743 --> 45:07.510
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

45:07.512 --> 45:09.245
- Are you okay?
- Are you?

45:09.247 --> 45:11.747
<i>Oh, my God, you guys.
I am so scared.</i>

45:11.749 --> 45:14.550
I am so sorry.
I don't know what happened
last night.

45:14.552 --> 45:16.652
- I just...
- No, no, no.

45:16.654 --> 45:18.420
- It went so far
and I messed up.
- Abby...

45:18.422 --> 45:21.190
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- This is not your fault.

45:21.192 --> 45:23.892
- Abby, it's not your fault.
- This is crazy.

45:23.894 --> 45:25.827
This is not your fault.

45:25.829 --> 45:29.765
- No, no, no, no.

45:31.934 --> 45:34.202
Okay, you did what
you thought you had to do

45:34.204 --> 45:36.938
in order to survive, okay?

45:36.940 --> 45:39.907
<i>Listen, listen, guys, listen.</i>

45:39.909 --> 45:43.878
We are on a small island
and we need to get off.

45:43.880 --> 45:45.646
We need to figure out
what to do.

45:47.449 --> 45:50.351
Maybe...

45:50.353 --> 45:52.852
<i>We can stay here</i>

45:52.854 --> 45:54.888
'cause they don't know
where we are here.

45:56.857 --> 45:58.658
The woods are dense and...

45:58.660 --> 46:01.695
and maybe they'll
go away, you know?

46:01.697 --> 46:03.930
No.

46:03.932 --> 46:05.599
<i>- No.
- They're not going away.</i>

46:05.601 --> 46:07.701
Lou, they're not going away.
Did you see them?

46:09.804 --> 46:12.372
- Yeah.
- They're not gonna stop.

46:12.374 --> 46:14.406
No.

46:14.408 --> 46:15.975
We have to get to our boat.

46:19.279 --> 46:22.648
They'll wait
for us at the campsite.
They know exactly where it is.

46:22.650 --> 46:24.516
They have a boat.
Let's get their boat.

46:24.518 --> 46:26.852
- It's Jimmy's boat.
- But where is it, Lou?

46:26.854 --> 46:29.488
- We can't just
walk around the island.
- We're not gonna go traipsing

46:29.490 --> 46:33.459
- around the island
'cause they'll find us.
- Okay, okay, okay.

46:35.628 --> 46:38.630
Okay.

46:38.632 --> 46:40.798
<i>We need to think
of something.</i>

46:40.800 --> 46:42.400
We wait until it's dark.

46:45.671 --> 46:48.740
We wait until it's dark
and we go to our boat.

46:50.843 --> 46:52.910
<i>- Let's do that.
-  Okay.</i>

46:55.046 --> 46:56.813
So we just wait.

47:03.489 --> 47:05.455
Did you hear that?

48:06.047 --> 48:07.815
<i>There it is.</i>

48:09.551 --> 48:11.518
Okay.

48:17.459 --> 48:20.026
- They cut the rope.
- Damn it.

48:20.028 --> 48:21.694
- How far do you think it's out there?
-  I don't know.

48:21.696 --> 48:24.497
<i>It's far, you know?
It's far.</i>

48:24.499 --> 48:27.400
Tide's going out.
If anything, it's probably
going further away.

48:27.402 --> 48:29.969
<i>-  We can swim that.
We can swim that.
- No.</i>

48:29.971 --> 48:31.704
No, we cannot
fucking swim that.

48:31.706 --> 48:33.506
Are you fucking crazy?
It's freezing.

48:33.508 --> 48:36.843
We get hypothermia
in less than 15 minutes
in fucking August.

48:36.845 --> 48:40.512
It's not that far.
We can do this.
We have to.

48:42.115 --> 48:43.982
<i>What else are we gonna
fucking do?</i>

48:43.984 --> 48:46.518
No, guys. We'll fucking
die in that water.

48:49.922 --> 48:52.424
<i>I'm a good swimmer.
I can do this.</i>

48:54.527 --> 48:55.927
You guys go back to the fort.

48:55.929 --> 48:57.963
You stay safe.
You stay covered.

48:57.965 --> 48:59.630
I'll get to the boat,
get to the mainland,

48:59.632 --> 49:01.499
and come back with the cops.

49:01.501 --> 49:03.701
<i>There is no sense
with the three of us</i>

49:03.703 --> 49:06.103
<i>risking our lives out here.</i>

49:06.105 --> 49:08.105
<i>We can't do that.
We can't.</i>

49:08.107 --> 49:10.841
Worst case...

49:10.843 --> 49:14.879
They get me and you guys
use the distraction...

49:14.881 --> 49:16.414
you just head for the boat.
Go for the boat.

49:16.416 --> 49:17.615
<i>- You just...
- No.</i>

49:17.617 --> 49:20.150
- Yes. Yes.
- No. We are in this together.

49:20.152 --> 49:22.986
She's right.
It's the three
of us now.

49:29.493 --> 49:32.195
- Okay.
- Thank you for offering that.

49:35.766 --> 49:37.967
All right.

49:37.969 --> 49:40.203
I'm gonna go first.

49:40.205 --> 49:42.638
<i>If I get to the boat
before you do,</i>

49:42.640 --> 49:44.773
<i>I will row back
for your fat asses.</i>

49:46.576 --> 49:48.644
Because you're probably
going to be drowning
behind me.

49:50.013 --> 49:51.480
Let's go.

50:04.059 --> 50:06.861
Okay, we can do this.
Just stay low and quiet.

50:18.006 --> 50:19.874
Guys...

50:19.876 --> 50:22.210
This doesn't feel right.

50:22.212 --> 50:24.678
Guys?

50:25.913 --> 50:28.849
- I don't know.
- Shh, Sarah.

50:28.851 --> 50:30.817
Guys.

50:31.919 --> 50:34.855
Guys!

50:34.857 --> 50:38.258
- We're not gonna make that out
there. It's too fucking far.
- It's not far.

50:38.260 --> 50:40.093
- We got this, Sarah.
- It's too far.

50:40.095 --> 50:42.062
- Shh.
- We're not gonna make it, Abby!

50:42.064 --> 50:44.563
- Shh!
- It's too far out there!

50:44.565 --> 50:46.131
- It's too far!
- We've got this, Sarah!

50:46.133 --> 50:48.100
- It's too far!
We've gotta go back.
- Shh.

50:48.102 --> 50:49.768
- Sarah, Sarah!
- I'm gonna go back.
I'm gonna go back.

50:49.770 --> 50:51.837
<i>- Sarah, there is no...</i>

50:51.839 --> 50:53.739
- Sarah!

50:56.544 --> 50:58.244
<i>- Go! Lou!</i>

50:58.246 --> 51:00.946
We gotta go!
Lou, go!

51:02.582 --> 51:04.682
<i>- Go!</i>

51:06.919 --> 51:08.887
Swim!

51:12.258 --> 51:14.559
<i> I can't feel...</i>

51:14.561 --> 51:16.661
<i>Alex, fucking go!</i>

51:16.663 --> 51:18.930
- Oh, shit! Oh, my God,
it's too far!
- Come on!

51:18.932 --> 51:20.798
Come on!
You can do this! Go!

51:24.003 --> 51:26.270
- Derek.
- Alex, get down on
the fucking beach.

51:26.272 --> 51:28.238
I can't!

51:29.941 --> 51:33.243
- Go!
- Holy shit...
I can't do it, Abby!

51:33.245 --> 51:36.013
- Yes, you can!
- Look how far that
fucking boat...

51:37.582 --> 51:40.584
look! I'm fucking numb.

51:40.586 --> 51:42.920
Okay, okay.
Can you make
that point?

51:42.922 --> 51:45.088
<i>- Where?
-  There.</i>

51:45.090 --> 51:47.023
Go!

51:54.932 --> 51:56.699
- They're coming!
-  They're right there!

51:56.701 --> 52:00.169
- Lou, swim!
-  Go down there!

52:00.171 --> 52:03.272
- Swim, Lou, swim! Do it!
-  Get on the beach!

52:03.274 --> 52:06.608
- I can't.
- You can.

52:06.610 --> 52:08.944
<i>Get the fuck
down there, Alex!</i>

52:18.588 --> 52:21.990
- Go back! Give me your hand!
- I hear ya, I hear ya.
I'm coming.

52:21.992 --> 52:24.192
<i>-  Derek!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

52:24.194 --> 52:26.661
Where the fuck did they go?
Did you see 'em?

52:26.663 --> 52:28.696
- Fuck.
- My fucking leg, man.

52:35.304 --> 52:37.771
<i>- Fuck!
- Fucking help me, man!</i>

52:37.773 --> 52:39.707
<i>- All right, all right.
- Shit, man.</i>

52:39.709 --> 52:40.908
- Oh, fuck.
- What does it look like?!

52:40.910 --> 52:42.943
- Don't move it. Don't move.

52:42.945 --> 52:44.678
<i>It's bad.
It's not that bad,
it's not that bad.</i>

52:44.680 --> 52:46.747
- All right, all right.
- Oh, God darn it.

52:46.749 --> 52:48.681
<i>- I'm here with ya. All right,
we'll take care of it.
- It hurts, man.</i>

52:53.053 --> 52:54.821
You'll be fine.

52:59.927 --> 53:01.894
Come on.
Come on.

53:03.831 --> 53:05.798
Get up.

53:10.670 --> 53:12.638
- I can't... I can't...
- Get up.

53:46.972 --> 53:51.041
<i>We have to...
we have to get warm, okay?</i>

53:51.043 --> 53:53.343
Take all the wet stuff off.

53:55.346 --> 53:56.913
Okay? Take it off.

53:56.915 --> 53:59.749
<i>- What?
- Take the wet clothes off.</i>

54:06.424 --> 54:09.159
Oh, I can't.
I can't.

54:09.161 --> 54:11.927
Yes, you can.

54:11.929 --> 54:14.263
Yes, you can.
It's too cold.

54:38.320 --> 54:41.856
Body... for body heat.

54:41.858 --> 54:43.825
Huddle, huddle.

54:55.236 --> 54:57.204
- Shh.
- Yeah.

55:01.909 --> 55:03.944
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

55:06.013 --> 55:08.315
I know.

55:08.317 --> 55:11.084
- I know.
- Sarah...

55:12.987 --> 55:14.954
I know.

55:20.460 --> 55:23.095
Oh, God.

55:23.097 --> 55:26.465
I can't believe
this is happening.

55:26.467 --> 55:28.467
No.

55:28.469 --> 55:31.504
I can't believe
this is fucking
happening right now.

55:31.506 --> 55:35.006
This is actually
happening to us.

55:35.008 --> 55:37.308
These are soldiers.

55:37.310 --> 55:39.410
Trained soldiers, Abby.

55:39.412 --> 55:41.980
They're trained to kill people.

55:41.982 --> 55:43.348
They have guns.
They're...

55:46.486 --> 55:48.253
What do we have?
What do we...

55:48.255 --> 55:52.157
we have nothing.

55:52.159 --> 55:55.159
- They're gonna kill us,
they're gonna kill us...
- Shut up.

55:58.129 --> 56:00.097
Okay?

56:01.332 --> 56:03.500
If they hear you,

56:03.502 --> 56:06.370
they're gonna kill us
really fucking fast,

56:06.372 --> 56:09.540
so shut up.

56:12.443 --> 56:14.344
- Look at me.
- I can't.

56:14.346 --> 56:17.914
- Abby, I can't.
- Lou, Lou.

56:17.916 --> 56:20.249
We are getting off
this island, okay?

56:20.251 --> 56:22.084
You and me.
You and me.

56:22.086 --> 56:24.120
We are the only two people
in the world right now.

56:24.122 --> 56:26.455
The whole wide world.
You and me.

56:26.457 --> 56:29.926
We are not gonna fucking die
on this island.

56:29.928 --> 56:31.894
Okay?

56:34.231 --> 56:36.198
Lou.

56:40.069 --> 56:41.536
Lou.

56:47.243 --> 56:49.945
You fucking hit me one more
time, I'll fucking rip your
throat out.

56:51.113 --> 56:52.881
Fucking...

56:54.383 --> 56:57.117
okay, okay, okay.

56:57.119 --> 56:58.452
- Look at me.
- Yeah.

56:58.454 --> 57:00.054
- There you are.
- Hi.

57:00.056 --> 57:02.323
- There you are.
- Yeah.

57:02.325 --> 57:04.458
Okay.

57:04.460 --> 57:05.993
- See?
- Yeah.

57:05.995 --> 57:09.096
We're gonna get off
this island.

57:09.098 --> 57:11.098
- Okay?
- Yeah.

57:11.100 --> 57:13.234
We're gonna get off
this island.

57:13.236 --> 57:15.202
Breathe.

57:16.938 --> 57:18.438
Okay.

57:18.440 --> 57:21.374
Now we just need
to make a plan.

57:21.376 --> 57:23.209
Okay, we just need a plan.

57:27.147 --> 57:29.282
I've wanted to hit you
for so long.

57:29.284 --> 57:31.251
Just so you know.

57:40.960 --> 57:42.928
Hi.

57:44.430 --> 57:46.398
I love you, abs.

57:52.139 --> 57:54.640
- Now let's fucking
get back to it.
- Okay, okay.

58:00.045 --> 58:03.581
They're gonna find us here.
This is...

58:03.583 --> 58:05.349
- I mean, they're
looking for us right now.
- They're looking for us

58:05.351 --> 58:08.152
and they'll find us right here.

58:08.154 --> 58:09.921
- Okay...
- So...

58:13.325 --> 58:15.693
I say we fucking go for it.

58:15.695 --> 58:18.562
- Yeah.
- We stop being stalked

58:18.564 --> 58:21.298
- and we start stalking, okay?
- Yup.

58:21.300 --> 58:23.333
Okay?

58:26.304 --> 58:28.405
And we kill them
before they kill us.

58:28.407 --> 58:31.341
I will fucking kill them.

58:31.343 --> 58:33.109
I will kill them.

58:35.012 --> 58:36.079
Okay.

58:39.016 --> 58:40.983
We need a weapon.

58:43.653 --> 58:45.621
We need something to fight.

58:47.457 --> 58:49.425
Okay.

58:51.061 --> 58:53.028
Okay.

58:55.165 --> 58:56.732
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

58:59.269 --> 59:01.236
Lou.

59:10.279 --> 59:13.181
- Yeah.
- Okay?

59:13.183 --> 59:15.149
Okay?

59:16.418 --> 59:17.719
'Kay.

59:50.751 --> 59:53.519
- Listen...
- Which way?

59:53.521 --> 59:55.421
Okay, it's gotta be here.
It's gotta be.

59:55.423 --> 59:57.123
- Yeah.
- Right? Dig.

59:57.125 --> 59:59.191
Okay.

59:59.193 --> 01:00:00.726
Fuck.

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:07.165
This is it, right?

01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:09.134
<i>Okay. This is it.
It's gotta be here.</i>

01:00:10.369 --> 01:00:12.337
- Oh, God.
- I don't know.

01:00:16.108 --> 01:00:18.510
- Fuck.

01:00:18.512 --> 01:00:20.478
- Hey. That's it.
- Yeah.

01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:28.385
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:00:31.489 --> 01:00:33.457
Shh.

01:00:45.269 --> 01:00:46.836
Oh, my God.

01:00:50.474 --> 01:00:51.841
Okay.

01:00:56.647 --> 01:00:58.414
<i>- Shh.</i>

01:01:12.261 --> 01:01:14.396
Wait, wait.

01:01:14.398 --> 01:01:15.630
What is that?

01:01:18.734 --> 01:01:20.102
Spears.

01:01:53.801 --> 01:01:55.768
<i>Abby...</i>

01:02:00.174 --> 01:02:03.543
I feel so ashamed
for what I did to you.

01:02:05.779 --> 01:02:08.313
I'm so angry that
I sabotaged that.

01:02:12.485 --> 01:02:15.554
I can't believe
I'm 30 years old
and I just...

01:02:15.556 --> 01:02:19.258
Feel so unhinged, you know?

01:02:25.431 --> 01:02:27.399
I left Mike.

01:02:30.669 --> 01:02:33.404
I hadn't even told Sarah yet.

01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:41.913
And... the stuff

01:02:41.915 --> 01:02:44.549
with you and me...

01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:47.785
You know, I know that...

01:02:47.787 --> 01:02:51.454
I've held onto that
for a really long time.

01:02:54.926 --> 01:02:57.360
I just...

01:02:57.362 --> 01:02:59.829
I always felt
like it was so much...

01:02:59.831 --> 01:03:02.832
Easier to blame you for...

01:03:03.968 --> 01:03:06.636
Things not working out...

01:03:06.638 --> 01:03:09.639
Than it was to just...

01:03:09.641 --> 01:03:13.509
Admit that maybe
I had messed it up.

01:03:13.511 --> 01:03:15.277
It's easier to put it on you.

01:03:18.815 --> 01:03:20.783
I'm really sorry.

01:03:25.222 --> 01:03:26.855
- Good.

01:04:30.651 --> 01:04:32.418
<i>That must be their boat.</i>

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.855
Down there.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.927
I don't see the other one.

01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:46.031
Neither do I.

01:04:47.566 --> 01:04:50.435
- Are we gonna do this?
- Yup.

01:04:52.905 --> 01:04:54.872
If we're gonna do it,
we've gotta do it right now.

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:00.878
- Yup.
- I'll fucking do it.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.479
- I'll do it.
- No, no.

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:05.516
I wanna do it.
I wanna do it.

01:05:05.518 --> 01:05:07.985
Oh, God.
You cover my back, okay?

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:09.753
You keep your fucking eyes out
for that other guy,

01:05:09.755 --> 01:05:11.989
and if he comes,
you cover my back.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.757
I got your back.

01:05:16.527 --> 01:05:18.594
Okay. Okay.

01:05:20.631 --> 01:05:22.665
Okay.

01:05:24.768 --> 01:05:27.570
Is there... do I...
do I hit a vein?

01:05:27.572 --> 01:05:30.073
- Is there a vein
in there that I need...
- You're gonna take this

01:05:30.075 --> 01:05:33.876
and you're gonna puncture
his fucking vein here

01:05:33.878 --> 01:05:36.011
and you're gonna
pull it across.

01:05:36.013 --> 01:05:37.979
Hard.

01:05:39.882 --> 01:05:41.883
Okay. Okay.

01:05:51.427 --> 01:05:53.628
Listen to me, Abigail.

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:55.864
Look at me.
You're gonna
fucking do this.

01:05:55.866 --> 01:05:57.832
I got to.
I'm gonna do it.

01:05:57.834 --> 01:05:59.667
You're gonna
fucking slit
his throat.

01:05:59.669 --> 01:06:01.402
I'm gonna
fucking slit
his throat.

01:06:01.404 --> 01:06:03.504
- I'm gonna
fucking slit his throat.
- I got your back.

01:06:03.506 --> 01:06:06.006
- You cover me.
- I got you.

01:06:06.008 --> 01:06:08.609
- Slit his...
- You crazy fucking bitch.

01:06:08.611 --> 01:06:10.378
You fucking...

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.114
- ready?
- Okay.

01:06:13.116 --> 01:06:14.882
- Go.
- Okay.

01:07:43.133 --> 01:07:45.734
Derek!

01:07:45.736 --> 01:07:47.236
- Derek, they're here!

01:07:47.238 --> 01:07:49.472
Bitch!
Derek, they're here!

01:07:49.474 --> 01:07:52.107
- Derek!
- I'm coming!

01:08:19.234 --> 01:08:23.170
- Motherfucker!
- Oh, God! No!

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.038
No, no!

01:08:26.041 --> 01:08:28.108
No, no, don't.

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:30.077
- Please.

01:08:41.622 --> 01:08:43.589
Fuck! Fuck!

01:09:14.252 --> 01:09:15.819
I got you.

01:09:17.857 --> 01:09:20.759
Where can you go?
Where you gonna go?

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:30.167
<i>Stay still.</i>

01:09:30.169 --> 01:09:32.236
Still.
If you don't...

01:09:32.238 --> 01:09:34.805
you want...
you want me to just use one.
You don't want this twice.

01:09:34.807 --> 01:09:36.573
<i>- Then fucking do it!
- Okay.</i>

01:09:36.576 --> 01:09:38.042
- Just fucking do it.
- No!

01:09:42.314 --> 01:09:45.081
No! No!

01:09:49.219 --> 01:09:51.187
Fuck!

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:58.795
Fuck!

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:15.277
<i>-  Please.
- Stop. Please, stop.</i>

01:10:15.279 --> 01:10:17.245
<i>- Stop?
- Yeah.</i>

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.719
And just all walk away?

01:10:23.721 --> 01:10:25.754
Maybe we have a nice picnic
or something?

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:30.858
No!

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:34.795
<i>You killed my two best friends!</i>

01:10:36.798 --> 01:10:39.000
This ends with you two dead.

01:11:14.901 --> 01:11:16.869
Die, you fucker!

01:11:53.204 --> 01:11:55.972
Fuck... you!
