00:34.134 --> 00:37.194
-Mama!
-All right.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.964
-This one.
-Here you go.

00:40.507 --> 00:41.701
Thank you.

00:41.908 --> 00:42.897
And that one.

00:44.944 --> 00:47.742
There. That's about it.

00:50.817 --> 00:52.648
-Bye, honey.
-Bye.

00:57.824 --> 01:00.019
See you at 6:00 at the station.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.194
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye, Daddy.

01:04.197 --> 01:05.664
Bye, Dad.

01:06.900 --> 01:12.099
To speak properly, it is necessary
to enunciate every syllable.

01:12.338 --> 01:17.401
Example: Twenty dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

01:17.610 --> 01:21.546
Twenty dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

01:21.748 --> 01:27.243
Example: Twenty dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

01:27.454 --> 01:31.857
Twenty dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

01:32.058 --> 01:36.085
To speak properly, it is necessary
to enunciate every syllable.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.767
-You call that an amber?
-Yes.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.769
-And this is...?
-This is like a lavender purple.

01:47.974 --> 01:51.171
lt goes well with the white.
You can wear any of these with white.

01:51.377 --> 01:52.935
Exquisite combination, Mr. Siegel.

01:55.215 --> 01:56.910
That's Bugsy Siegel.

01:58.618 --> 02:02.418
By the way, that yachtsman's blazer
came in that you were asking for...

02:02.622 --> 02:04.453
...and l have it in the back for you....

02:06.993 --> 02:09.426
May l have a word with you, please?

02:19.405 --> 02:21.430
Look, the name is Benjamin Siegel.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.576
Benjamin. Benjamin.
lt's in the Bible.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.574
lt's also on my birth certificate.

02:26.779 --> 02:29.771
Now, ''bug'' is a name
for something that crawls in dirt.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.774
l couldn't agree with you more.
You're absolutely right.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.214
No question, Mr. Siegel.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.481
-Ben.
-Ben.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.783
l know you're here with your family.
l don't wanna embarrass you.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.120
l appreciate that deeply.

02:44.464 --> 02:47.228
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye to you, Mr. Siegel.

02:47.433 --> 02:49.401
And thank you again.

03:15.562 --> 03:21.899
-Mr. Siegel. Floor please, madam?
-Penthouse.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.611
lf we make love,
it'll be the only time.

03:33.846 --> 03:36.906
-What if you like it?
-l know l'll like it.

03:38.218 --> 03:42.450
-l think l got off on the wrong floor.
-You'd better get back on.

03:58.438 --> 04:02.340
-Don't stop.
-ls that hurting?

04:06.946 --> 04:08.277
Meyer, take it easy.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.575
l'm gonna be a half an hour.
l got 1 0 minutes of sunlamp....

04:11.784 --> 04:15.117
All right,
l'll do the sunlamp on the train.

04:15.321 --> 04:20.156
Of course l'm alone.
She was an hour ago.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.794
l have thought about it.
l gotta do it.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.591
Call Charlie. He likes to take a nap
when there's gonna be trouble.

04:34.741 --> 04:36.174
Ben, l gotta tell you again...

04:36.376 --> 04:39.937
...that it really does affect my opinion
of your ability to administrate...

04:40.146 --> 04:42.444
...when you get involved
in this type of detail.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.776
Charlie, tell him what you said
when l told you.

04:44.984 --> 04:48.681
-What do you think l said to you?
-See what l'm talking about?

04:48.888 --> 04:52.790
-Then you just shook your head.
-Of course. What else was l gonna do?

04:57.930 --> 05:00.262
All right. Count to 53.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.902
-Good evening, Mr. Siegel.
-Hi.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.180
-Give that a brush for me, will you?
-Sure.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.380
Hiya, Marty. Same to you, Ted.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.117
Hiya, Jerry.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.488
Ben. What are you doing here?
l thought you were going to California.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.822
l am. l just came
to give you a goodbye present.

05:32.365 --> 05:34.663
-Present?
-Yeah, open it.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.064
-l don't get it.
-You know...

05:43.276 --> 05:45.642
...Meyer, Charlie and l,
we hire you to do a job...

05:45.845 --> 05:48.746
...we pay you a nice salary,
we throw in a piece of the action...

05:48.948 --> 05:51.746
...and you pay us back by
stealing from us for the second time.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.283
-Stealing?
-Yeah. The shirt off my back.

05:54.487 --> 05:58.685
Do you want the shirt off my back?
l'd be happy to give it to you. Here.

05:58.891 --> 06:02.190
-From Sulka's. The ones l wear.
-Could l say something here?

06:02.395 --> 06:04.420
lf l had taken longer,
l would've bought you...

06:04.630 --> 06:07.497
...some pants and suits and jackets
and shoes. But you know what?

06:07.700 --> 06:10.601
-But l can give you a couple of tips.
-Tips?

06:10.803 --> 06:14.000
-Let me see your shoes.
-My shoes?

06:14.207 --> 06:17.233
l don't wanna be rude to you,
but they don't go with anything.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.111
-Another couple tips....
-l'm a little confused here.

06:22.281 --> 06:25.944
Thirty-nine hundred dollars we pay
to hire three guys to take care of this.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.483
What are we doing here?

06:27.687 --> 06:31.088
What am l gonna tell you, Charlie,
his thinking process?

06:31.491 --> 06:34.426
The way l see it,
Ben has only one problem...

06:34.627 --> 06:38.927
...the same problem he's had since
we were kids together on the street:

06:39.132 --> 06:40.622
He doesn't respect money.

06:47.707 --> 06:53.009
But that's for summer, and, Jerry,
you don't have to worry about summer.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.736
Ben, no, don't.

06:54.947 --> 06:58.815
lf it was just business, l'd be selling
insurance or importing dresses.

07:19.071 --> 07:20.732
Remember this, Ben:

07:20.940 --> 07:24.671
The key to taking over Jack Dragna's
Southern California rackets...

07:24.877 --> 07:26.708
...is to come in smooth.

07:26.913 --> 07:30.508
Approach him like all we want
is to come in as a partner.

07:30.716 --> 07:35.244
The guy's been running the rackets
for 20 years with no competition.

07:35.488 --> 07:37.888
Except for Mickey Cohen,
who don't even count.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.355
So the only way to move in
on Dragna is amiably.

07:41.561 --> 07:43.324
What about the gambling joints
and clubs?

07:43.529 --> 07:45.793
-Vito, l just said it's fifty-fifty.
-Fifty-fifty.

07:45.998 --> 07:49.593
We move in, but we don't
ruin anything by being too crazy.

07:49.802 --> 07:53.499
Joey A. knows Jack Dragna
personally. What do you think, Joey?

07:54.006 --> 07:58.067
Jack's a cold-blooded killer,
so you gotta be careful with him.

07:58.277 --> 08:01.212
Just don't say nothing
that he'd take offense at.

08:01.848 --> 08:05.079
-What are you smiling at?
-Nothing.

08:07.186 --> 08:11.589
-Why can't we go to California?
-Maybe next time.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.557
What is it?

08:14.760 --> 08:18.025
Ben, when you get to Los Angeles,
don't call George.

08:18.231 --> 08:21.530
l know he's a good friend of yours,
but he's such a movie star now...

08:21.734 --> 08:24.464
...he attracts more attention
than Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

08:24.704 --> 08:28.640
-The trip's gotta be quick and quiet.
-And amiable.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.173
Very funny. Twelve days.

08:31.377 --> 08:34.938
Four days out. Four days
of diplomacy. Four days back.

08:35.147 --> 08:37.910
-No one even knows you were there.
-All right.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.315
Ben, could l talk to you
for a minute, alone?

08:44.524 --> 08:47.425
After l say goodbye to the family,
all right?

08:52.732 --> 08:54.996
-l'll miss you.
-l'll miss you.

08:55.201 --> 09:00.002
When l get you on the phone,
tell me what presents you want.

09:00.239 --> 09:04.471
-l already know what l want.
-Don't tell me now. Think about it.

09:06.412 --> 09:08.107
<i>I need money, Ben.</i>

09:08.681 --> 09:10.979
-How much?
-Fifty thousand dollars.

09:11.183 --> 09:12.377
For what?

09:12.585 --> 09:17.852
The cops, the DA, the FBl.
They're threatening to lock me up.

09:18.057 --> 09:22.551
They're no good, these people,
except Assistant DA Allen Stein.

09:22.762 --> 09:25.822
Jewish kid. Nice fella.
His family's from Bedford Street.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.932
What happened to the 50,000
l just gave you?

09:28.134 --> 09:30.659
-What 50,000?
-For the armored-truck heist.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.839
That 50,000?
That 50,000's gone, Ben.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.100
You know me with money,
l blew it at the track.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.645
Harry, what are you saying?

09:40.846 --> 09:44.543
That if l don't give you $50,000,
you'll rat on everyone, including me?

09:44.750 --> 09:50.347
You? Never. l love you, Ben.
l would never rat on you. Never.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.589
You ain't gonna kill me, Ben,
are you?

10:02.768 --> 10:06.898
l'm gonna try very hard
to forget that this ever happened.

10:07.173 --> 10:10.404
-l owe you my life, Ben.
-l'd say that's a fair assessment.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.475
God bless you, Ben.

10:12.678 --> 10:16.114
-Bend your knees, Harry.
-Bend my knees?

10:16.315 --> 10:20.081
When you jump from the train,
bend your knees to soften the impact.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.015
Bend my knees.

10:22.221 --> 10:25.554
Okay, Ben. Sure thing.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.107
-Are you who l think you are?
-Yes, l am.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.076
-Your autograph, please?
-All right.

10:50.449 --> 10:53.247
Ray? Okay. ''To Ray.''
Here you go, Ray.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.181
Okay, we'll get everybody here.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.391
This has been four of the most
wonderful days l've ever spent.

11:00.593 --> 11:05.690
l gotta tell you, a lot of it
was in the motion of the train.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.060
-Ben.
-Hey.

11:09.035 --> 11:10.366
Oh, my gosh.

11:10.569 --> 11:14.369
Mister, he knows you.
Are you somebody too?

11:14.907 --> 11:16.636
l love you, George.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.174
You're looking great,
like a million bucks.

11:19.378 --> 11:23.144
You're looking good yourself, Georgie.
Very dapper, very dapper.

11:23.349 --> 11:27.911
Well, that's what they pay me for.
Okay, we're moving on here.

11:28.254 --> 11:32.520
l've got you registered at the
Beverly Hills Hotel, bungalow five.

11:32.725 --> 11:36.388
l know you said four days,
but l reserved six.

11:39.999 --> 11:43.696
But Jack Dragna's the kingpin here?
What do you hear about him?

11:43.903 --> 11:46.599
From what l hear,
he runs a nice little operation.

11:47.106 --> 11:51.167
You've got a city with 3 million people
and his operation is nice and little?

11:51.377 --> 11:55.711
l don't know. Less to worry about.
l'll drop you off, then go to the studio.

11:55.915 --> 11:59.578
-Why don't l go over with you?
-All right. lf you like.

12:10.529 --> 12:13.657
-Georgie, who are they?
-Bit players.

12:13.866 --> 12:16.835
l'm gonna run to Makeup.
Meet me on stage 2 1 .

12:42.361 --> 12:46.229
Enjoying yourself?
Now take a walk. Out.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.667
When l call for the extras,
then they come in.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.564
Do not come in before l call for you,
understand?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.932
Now, you wanna get outside
with them?

12:54.406 --> 12:56.340
You having a hard time
understanding me?

12:56.542 --> 13:01.104
When l need extras, l'll call for them.
Until then, wait outside.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.078
l'm not getting through, am l?

13:04.250 --> 13:08.380
Want me to send you to Wardrobe?
They take the suit, you're out of here.

13:09.021 --> 13:10.818
You want me to get tough with you?

13:11.157 --> 13:13.853
lf l have to, l will.
l will throw you out if l have to.

13:14.059 --> 13:17.119
You want me to pick you up
and throw you out? You think l can't?

13:17.329 --> 13:19.456
l don't need this aggravation
this time of day--

13:19.665 --> 13:21.360
Tim.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.535
This is my friend from New York,
Benny Siegel.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.296
He'll be spending the day with me.

13:34.713 --> 13:38.376
Yeah. Didn't-- Didn't--

13:38.584 --> 13:41.212
Yeah, l didn't connect....

13:41.687 --> 13:43.154
Confusion.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.558
-l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.

13:49.295 --> 13:52.822
lf you get tough with a guy,
stick to it.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.701
That's great advice. Thank you.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.297
Hank ain't very bright,
but he's my friend.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.839
lf he's hooked with a dame like you,
he'll get a lot of headaches.

14:04.043 --> 14:08.002
-l'm on to your racket.
-You've got the blueprints all drawn.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.876
-Cigarette. New cigarette.
-She's eaten a whole cigarette.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.573
Scene 36, take two. Marker.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.185
l'm telling you straight,
forget you ever seen him.

14:15.387 --> 14:17.787
lf you don't get what l mean,
this'll give you an idea.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.585
Take that money
and buy yourself some manners.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.761
For what? To waste on you?

14:24.163 --> 14:25.687
Marker.

14:25.898 --> 14:29.231
Two bucks? For what? One beer
and some phony champagne?

14:29.435 --> 14:31.426
-That's right, friend.
-Here's half a buck.

14:31.637 --> 14:34.435
-Split it between you.
-Take five. Marker.

14:35.107 --> 14:38.270
Two bucks? For what? One beer
and some phony champagne?

14:38.477 --> 14:41.002
Here's half a buck.
Split it between you.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.738
You're so cheap you're wholesale.

14:44.984 --> 14:48.385
Don't forget, mister,
l asked you nice.

14:48.587 --> 14:50.555
-Marker.
-Here we go. Rolling. Quiet, please.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.318
Reset. Reset. Let's go.

14:54.526 --> 14:56.619
Benny, you wanna hit somebody
with a chair?

14:59.999 --> 15:02.092
<i>Manpower</i>.
Scene 38, take eight. Marker.

15:03.202 --> 15:06.069
Boy, with this,
l can hit home runs all night.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.298
Here. Take this,
in case l wanna come back.

15:11.343 --> 15:14.039
l feel like l should say something.
Can't l have a line?

15:14.246 --> 15:17.079
Honey, he's the star. Let's go.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.414
That was pretty impressive,
Georgie boy.

15:25.057 --> 15:28.322
-Well, Benny, l'm a pro.
-Sure.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.589
May l?

15:34.733 --> 15:38.362
lf you want a simple yes or no,
you'll have to finish the question.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.937
-Light your cigarette?
-Sure.

15:50.149 --> 15:54.108
The way you were staring, l thought
you'd ask for something more exciting.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.255
-Like what?
-Use your imagination.

15:58.090 --> 16:02.754
-l'm using it.
-Let me know when you're finished.

16:12.137 --> 16:15.004
Now you're gonna tell me
she's a bit player?

16:15.207 --> 16:18.108
Flamingo? Not for Joey Adonis.
That's Virginia Hill.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.105
Yeah? That's Flamingo, huh?

16:21.580 --> 16:24.515
Now, don't get no ideas, Ben.
You know how crazy Joey is.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.447
No woman's worth a bullet
between the eyes. Am l right?

16:27.653 --> 16:30.144
lt depends on whose eyes
and which woman.

16:35.127 --> 16:38.460
Look, you're Ben Siegel
and l'm Virginia Hill, okay?

16:38.664 --> 16:41.656
Why are you so interested in a gal
who's going with your friend?

16:41.867 --> 16:43.664
What friend? Joey A.?
He's not my friend.

16:43.869 --> 16:46.770
He's an associate of an associate.
Are you still going with him?

16:46.972 --> 16:49.304
lf it were New Year's Eve,
he would be my date.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.476
Who would your date be?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.304
-Wife.
-Wife?

16:53.512 --> 16:55.104
-Esta.
-Esther?

16:55.314 --> 16:56.906
Esta. E-S-T-A.

16:57.116 --> 17:02.452
Good. l'll bet Esta lives her life
faithful to her one and only Ben...

17:02.688 --> 17:06.714
...who plays around like a jackrabbit
and lies about it through his teeth.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.449
l don't lie to Esta.

17:08.660 --> 17:12.528
That's noble. What do you do,
confess your sins three times a day?

17:15.601 --> 17:19.162
Now, what exactly does Mr. Esta
want from Miss Virginia?

17:20.138 --> 17:23.939
Right now? Mr. Esta is having
a tremendous amount of difficulty...

17:24.143 --> 17:26.667
...imagining anything
he doesn't want from Miss Virginia.

17:27.146 --> 17:30.582
-Are you ready for a divorce?
-Never.

17:30.783 --> 17:35.220
My, oh, my. You're pretty ferocious
where Mom's concerned, aren't you?

17:35.921 --> 17:40.255
The rest of the time, you're another
sweet-talking, fuck-happy fellow...

17:40.459 --> 17:44.395
...with nothing to offer but dialogue.
Dialogue's cheap in Hollywood.

17:45.030 --> 17:48.830
Why don't you run outside
and jerk yourself a soda?

18:02.748 --> 18:08.345
Let me ask you, how would someone
go about getting a screen test done?

18:08.554 --> 18:11.921
-You know someone who wants one?
-No, no, no. l just....

18:12.124 --> 18:15.252
l just thought if it came up
in a conversation....

18:15.461 --> 18:18.225
What about Virginia Hill?
Does she have a future in movies?

18:18.430 --> 18:21.888
ln movies? l don't know
if l've got a future in movies.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.295
Lana Turner lives there.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.467
Cesar Romero lives there.

18:28.707 --> 18:31.175
And Gary Cooper is in
that house on the right.

18:31.376 --> 18:33.071
He paid 45 grand.

18:33.278 --> 18:37.009
-Houses bring in that kind of money?
-Sure, and more.

18:37.216 --> 18:40.583
-Whose is that?
-Lawrence.... The opera singer.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.845
-Melchoir?
-No, no, no. The other guy.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.285
-What other guy?
-What's-his-name.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.984
-Tibbett? Lawrence Tibbett? Stop.
-That's it.

18:49.394 --> 18:52.659
-What are you doing?
-Paying my respects.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.304
-Yes?
-l'm looking for Mr. Lawrence Tibbett.

19:04.610 --> 19:05.941
Mr. Tibbett's in the study.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.276
-May l tell him who's calling?
-Ben Siegel.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.778
-ls he expecting you?
-Not unless he's psychic.

19:12.651 --> 19:17.486
Well, would you excuse me
for a moment, please.

19:23.061 --> 19:28.727
-How far is your house from here?
-Half a mile. What are you doing?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.864
Mr. Siegel.

19:36.775 --> 19:41.007
Lawrence Tibbett. You have no idea
what an honor it is to meet you.

19:41.213 --> 19:46.344
l took my family to hear you sing
<i>Rigoletto</i> at the Met last year.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.645
lt was one of the great evenings
of our lives.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.754
Well, you overwhelm me,
Mr. Siegel.

19:50.956 --> 19:52.651
-Ben.
-Ben?

19:52.858 --> 19:55.656
-That's beautiful.
-Ben Siegel?

19:55.861 --> 19:59.388
You wouldn't be related
to Bugsy Siegel, would you?

19:59.598 --> 20:02.726
-''Bugsy''? What do you mean?
-l beg your pardon.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.870
A bug is nothing. A bug doesn't exist.
The word has no meaning.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.539
lt's used out of ignorance.
Do you know what a bug is?

20:08.740 --> 20:11.072
A bug is a colloquialism.
lt has no basis in reality.

20:11.276 --> 20:13.608
lnsects include a wide variety
of living creatures.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.609
They fly, they crawl,
they do many things.

20:15.814 --> 20:18.180
None of them can be called a bug!
You following me?

20:18.383 --> 20:22.217
Yes. Yes, l am. l certainly didn't
mean any offense, Mr. Siegel.

20:22.421 --> 20:23.683
-Ben.
-Ben.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.983
-Mind if l look around, Larry?
-Of course. Be my guest.

20:27.192 --> 20:32.858
-Do you mind if l call you Larry?
-Not a bit. All my friends call me Larry.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.034
What brings you
to Los Angeles, Ben?

20:36.235 --> 20:37.930
Curiosity.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.934
-This is a wonderful house.
-Thank you.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.198
What do you think
of the Beverly Hills Hotel?

20:43.408 --> 20:48.072
-lt's the best hotel in town.
-Do you prefer a bungalow or a suite?

20:48.280 --> 20:50.407
The bungalows.
Which one do you have?

20:50.616 --> 20:54.143
l don't. You do. Bungalow five.

20:54.353 --> 20:57.789
-l don't understand.
-l'm buying this house from you.

20:57.990 --> 21:02.984
-This house isn't for sale.
-Sure it is. Everything's for sale.

21:03.195 --> 21:06.494
-How much do you want?
-Mr. Siegel....

21:08.133 --> 21:10.363
-Ben.
-Ben.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.594
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Like what?

21:13.805 --> 21:15.238
Are you gonna hurt me?

21:16.575 --> 21:20.477
Hurt you? l would protect you
from anyone who tried to hurt you.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.477
l revere you.
Your voice makes life justifiable.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.172
l'm just trying to give you money.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.716
-For the house?
-What did you buy it for?

21:27.919 --> 21:30.513
Thirty-five thousand dollars
But that was a few years ago.

21:30.722 --> 21:34.351
l could probably get 40,000 now,
maybe more. But even if l....

21:34.559 --> 21:37.357
lt's not really a financial issue,
Mr. Siegel.

21:37.562 --> 21:40.087
-Ben. Ben. Ben.
-Ben. Ben. Ben.

21:41.533 --> 21:45.902
One, two, three, four.

21:46.104 --> 21:49.301
-That's $50,000. ls that enough?
-lt's more than enough.

21:49.508 --> 21:53.205
l wanna be careful. l wanna know this
is a pleasurable day for the both of us.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.910
How about that?
Another 1 0, that's 60,000.

21:56.114 --> 22:00.813
lt makes me sick inside when l don't
bring pleasure to someone l admire.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.487
-Does this bring you pleasure, Larry?
-My goodness, yes.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.156
Then why don't l see you smiling?

22:05.624 --> 22:08.491
The way you spend money,
you never have anything left.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.628
So? l'll make more.
lt's only dirty paper.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.593
What are you gonna do with a house?
You're only here four days.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.664
Who knows,
maybe l'll stay a little longer.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.301
l've gotta get to Jack Dragna's.
Where can l get a taxi?

22:18.503 --> 22:19.993
l'll drive you.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.703
This is business.
You don't wanna be there.

22:33.452 --> 22:37.320
-Nice car.
-Thank you.

22:47.265 --> 22:50.393
-Louie.
-What the hell is this?

22:58.343 --> 22:59.970
l'm looking for Jack Dragna.

23:00.178 --> 23:02.738
-Who the fuck are you?
-Ben Siegel.

23:04.282 --> 23:08.013
l'm Lou, Jack's brother.
l'll tell Jack you're here.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.986
He'll just be a few seconds.
Jack's finishing eating.

23:14.326 --> 23:17.022
-Look, Mr. Siegel--
-Ben. Call me Ben, Jack.

23:17.229 --> 23:21.188
We run a smooth little operation.
With all due respect to you, Lansky...

23:21.400 --> 23:25.734
...Luciano, Joey A., and whoever
the fuck else you represent...

23:25.937 --> 23:29.703
...l suggest you spend your time
in California looking for broads...

23:29.908 --> 23:32.570
...which we got plenty of.
Some of the finest in the world.

23:32.778 --> 23:35.372
And which, l understand,
is right up your alley.

23:35.781 --> 23:39.877
There's a subject l can help you on.
Phone numbers, whatnot.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.781
But if you're coming to me
looking to do business...

23:42.988 --> 23:46.321
...l'm afraid
l'm completely disinterested.

23:46.525 --> 23:49.119
''Uninterested.''
Disinterested means ''impartial.''

23:49.327 --> 23:51.386
''Uninterested'' means
''not interested.''

23:51.630 --> 23:54.929
Look, you got two alternatives, Jack.

23:55.133 --> 23:57.328
You can take your 64 guys
and work for us.

23:57.536 --> 24:01.028
That means your little operation
will then be a big operation.

24:01.239 --> 24:03.104
Twenty betting parlors, not three.

24:03.308 --> 24:07.108
Owning a wire service,
not subscribing to a wire service.

24:07.312 --> 24:08.472
lt means taking risks.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.649
Meyer, Charlie and l, we put up
the money, we take 75 percent.

24:11.850 --> 24:13.340
You keep 25 percent...

24:13.552 --> 24:16.783
...which has gotta be worth three times
more than your 1 00 percent now.

24:16.988 --> 24:18.888
So what's the second alternative?

24:19.925 --> 24:21.916
The second alternative?

24:22.127 --> 24:25.153
The second alternative. Here.

24:26.097 --> 24:28.224
-Keep it. You take it.
-l got plenty of guns.

24:28.433 --> 24:33.132
-Squeeze the trigger, kill me.
-Kill you, that's the alternative?

24:45.851 --> 24:47.648
You guys have an unusual
sense of humor.

24:47.853 --> 24:51.186
You know what l think?
What they say about you is true.

24:51.389 --> 24:53.949
l think you're
out of your fucking mind.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.026
Take another five seconds
to make your selection.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.225
l guess that means
you're working for us.

25:03.435 --> 25:06.893
lt's a ball to have you onboard.
May l have my gun back? Thank you.

25:07.105 --> 25:10.666
Let's get started. Time is vicious
when you take it for granted.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.309
Bugsy, let me ask you a question.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.877
lf we break off this thing
with Transcontinental...

25:15.080 --> 25:17.310
-Transcontinental.
-...what are we gonna do--?

25:20.752 --> 25:23.915
All right, l'll give you
the benefit of the doubt...

25:24.122 --> 25:27.717
...and l will assume that you didn't
know that no one calls me that.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.417
Very nice meeting you, Jack.

25:31.162 --> 25:33.221
The fucking guy's crazy.

25:33.765 --> 25:35.733
Want me to run out
and shoot him in the back?

25:35.934 --> 25:39.995
Yeah, sure. Then we got Lansky and
Luciano blowing bullets up our ass.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.105
-So, what do we do?
-We wait, play along.

25:42.307 --> 25:45.936
Sooner or later he'll blow his lid.
Then, when we get him...

25:47.145 --> 25:49.238
...nobody will give a fuck.

26:24.449 --> 26:26.542
-Hello?
-Virginia, this is Ben.

26:32.691 --> 26:38.095
Meyer, l know we said 1 2 days.
Things got a little complicated.

27:44.529 --> 27:48.158
How was that? Was that good?
You're from <i>The Herald</i>, right?

27:48.400 --> 27:50.994
Do me a favor, will you?
Will you see that they run that...

27:51.202 --> 27:53.500
...and not one of those
sinister mug shots.

27:53.705 --> 27:57.106
-l'll try my best.
-l would really appreciate it.

27:57.308 --> 28:00.869
-May l have the next dance?
-Charmed. Have you met Mr. Siegel?

28:01.079 --> 28:03.843
Not formally, but l've been
admiring his movements.

28:04.049 --> 28:05.880
This is my husband,
Count Di Frasso.

28:06.084 --> 28:08.848
l'm surrounded by titles.
How can l pick one up?

28:09.054 --> 28:11.352
-A title?
-Yeah. l'm beginning to feel left out.

28:11.589 --> 28:15.218
Darling, get him a title.
Let's make him a duke.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.491
-A duke?
-A duke.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.425
Why not.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.826
Are you ready to come to ltaly,
Mr. Siegel?

28:22.033 --> 28:24.467
ltaly! l'll get my parachute.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.865
That's wonderful.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.977
You know who one of
the laughing count's best friends is?

28:42.187 --> 28:45.179
-No.
-Mussolini.

28:48.626 --> 28:50.651
-No.
-Yeah.

28:50.862 --> 28:53.296
That clown knows Mussolini?

28:54.966 --> 28:57.867
What do you think they do
when they're together? Play golf?

28:58.303 --> 29:01.466
Trade jokes about carting people
to the gas chambers?

29:01.673 --> 29:03.800
You know me. l stay out of politics.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.234
Politics? This is war.

29:07.545 --> 29:10.241
He's Hitler's partner,
he's our mortal enemy...

29:10.448 --> 29:12.575
...and this effete count
pals around with him?

29:12.784 --> 29:17.687
Don't get worked up over something
you can't do anything about.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.288
This is Hollywood.

29:24.295 --> 29:27.526
Mr. Siegel? There is a telephone call
for you, a Mr. Dragna.

29:27.732 --> 29:30.565
-l have placed a phone at your table.
-Thank you.

29:34.606 --> 29:38.872
Ben, have you met our number-one
crime fighter, James McWilde?

29:39.077 --> 29:40.977
-Haven't had the pleasure.
-How do you do?

29:41.179 --> 29:45.775
-He's up for re-election as DA.
-l know. l wish l could contribute.

29:45.984 --> 29:50.944
You can contact Donald Mitchell.
He handles all the money.

29:51.156 --> 29:53.784
Donald Mitchell.
Have him call me in the morning.

29:53.992 --> 29:57.655
lf you'll excuse me, l see about
six women that need to talk to me.

29:59.430 --> 30:03.423
Mr. McWilde, as a man of the world,
what do you make...

30:03.635 --> 30:07.696
...of all these friends Mussolini
has flitting around America?

30:08.339 --> 30:11.035
l had no idea that was the ca--
Are you talking about spies?

30:11.242 --> 30:15.508
Come, Jim, the senator's leaving
and he would like a word with you.

30:15.713 --> 30:17.442
Keep me posted
on this Mussolini thing.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.709
l will. We've gotta do something
about that.

30:24.455 --> 30:26.320
See the redhead?

30:29.861 --> 30:31.795
Put it in her hand.

30:34.465 --> 30:35.830
What is it, Jack?

30:36.034 --> 30:38.400
<i>This cocksucker Mickey Cohen...</i>

30:38.603 --> 30:43.540
<i>...just robbed our gambling joint</i>
<i>out of $56,000 cash.</i>

30:44.008 --> 30:45.441
<i>Fifty-six.</i>

30:45.643 --> 30:48.339
<i>I tell you, this time</i>
<i>I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna....</i>

31:26.084 --> 31:27.949
l'll see you in a few minutes.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.198
How do you know it was Cohen?

31:51.409 --> 31:55.505
He had a mask on, but it was him.
You could tell by the body, the voice.

31:56.648 --> 31:59.640
So one guy came in, robbed five guys
in their place of business...

31:59.851 --> 32:01.978
...of $56,000
and got away scot-free?

32:02.186 --> 32:06.122
-He took us by surprise.
-lt certainly seems like it.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.894
Don't worry about it.
He'll be dead within 2 4 hours.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.619
-l don't want him dead.
-Why not?

32:12.830 --> 32:14.297
l wanna talk to him.

32:15.667 --> 32:20.604
-You say 56,000?
-The exact figure was 56,1 43.

32:22.607 --> 32:26.236
<i>Dig into your pockets.</i>
<i>It's a matter of life and death.</i>

32:26.444 --> 32:30.437
<i>Mussolini and Hitler</i>
<i>must be stopped.</i>

32:44.329 --> 32:46.661
Hello. Hi, honey.

32:46.864 --> 32:48.729
--<i>go and buy yourself some manners.</i>

32:48.933 --> 32:51.424
<i>For what? To waste on you?</i>

32:51.636 --> 32:52.796
<i>Now, listen, mister</i>--

32:53.004 --> 32:55.939
Well, look, Esta.
Maybe the thing to do...

32:56.140 --> 32:59.473
...is for us to stop thinking about
when l'm coming back to Scarsdale...

32:59.677 --> 33:03.841
...and start thinking about when you
and the girls will come out here.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.514
No, as soon as possible.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.490
<i>Is there anything else?</i>

33:15.226 --> 33:17.660
<i>No. Check.</i>

33:17.862 --> 33:19.124
<i>What's the trouble, folks?</i>

33:19.330 --> 33:23.460
<i>Oh, this muzzler's trying to</i>
<i>buy out my spare time.</i>

33:24.469 --> 33:28.030
On the other hand, is this the right
time to take the kids out of school?

33:28.439 --> 33:32.808
Maybe we should just play it by ear
and see what happens.

33:41.386 --> 33:42.717
Yeah?

33:49.627 --> 33:52.653
We don't have to settle everything
in one conversation, do we?

33:52.864 --> 33:57.961
All right. The thing is, we'll see
each other before you know it.

33:58.169 --> 34:02.469
All right? l love you too, Esta.
Good night.

34:02.673 --> 34:04.334
Ronald, turn off the projector!

34:04.542 --> 34:08.444
-<i>Don't forget, mister</i>--
-Ronald, turn the projector off!

34:10.214 --> 34:14.708
Ronald! Ronald? Where are you?

34:14.918 --> 34:19.117
<i>Boy, with this,</i>
<i>I could hit home runs all night.</i>

34:23.226 --> 34:27.219
-Am l coming at a bad time?
-Not at all. Come on in.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.833
l don't want to interrupt
your pantomime.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.904
What are you watching?

34:42.112 --> 34:47.983
A newsreel, but it's over.
Why don't you come on in.

34:57.328 --> 34:59.353
Too fast to put a ring
on your finger?

34:59.564 --> 35:02.328
Nothing's too fast that fits.

35:03.334 --> 35:06.565
You always carry around
a spare ring?

35:06.771 --> 35:11.265
l figured l'd run into you.
Would you ever have called me?

35:11.476 --> 35:14.877
-l was planning to wait a while.
-When?

35:16.647 --> 35:19.275
-Ten years.
-Ten years?

35:19.517 --> 35:21.382
Why?

35:22.520 --> 35:27.116
Since all we're gonna do is bring
each other misery and torment....

35:27.325 --> 35:30.783
Why would we have to
bring each other misery and torment?

35:31.028 --> 35:34.088
We both want whatever we want
whenever we want it...

35:34.298 --> 35:36.823
...and we both want everything.

35:37.268 --> 35:40.066
That doesn't sound too promising,
does it?

35:40.271 --> 35:42.364
That's what l'm saying.

35:44.442 --> 35:50.039
-Then why did you come?
-Well, it wasn't caution.

35:51.048 --> 35:55.985
-What about Joey A.?
-We're in touch. Does that bother you?

35:56.254 --> 36:00.247
Because of your conscience or
you're worried about your business?

36:00.458 --> 36:02.688
l haven't thought it through
that clearly.

36:04.195 --> 36:06.095
Well, if he knew l were
here with you...

36:06.297 --> 36:10.256
...the only thing he'd be thinking about
is which of us to kill first.

36:10.468 --> 36:13.767
Do you wanna kiss me
as much as l wanna kiss you?

36:13.971 --> 36:17.065
How do you know
l wanna kiss you at all?

36:19.544 --> 36:23.002
l really don't think we should
go through with this, do you?

36:24.649 --> 36:26.981
ls that yes or no?

36:30.588 --> 36:32.146
Both.

36:33.691 --> 36:37.422
-You pack quite a punch.
-That wasn't a punch, it was a slap.

36:37.628 --> 36:40.256
lf l'd punched you, you'd be
stretched out across the floor.

36:40.464 --> 36:41.829
l'm sure you're right.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.365
l'm sure you're right
about everything.

36:44.569 --> 36:47.094
l'm sure you're right
about the misery and torment.

36:47.305 --> 36:50.570
And l'm sure you're right
about what you want.

36:50.808 --> 36:54.676
Do you always talk this much
before you do it?

36:56.013 --> 37:00.382
l only talk this much
before l'm gonna kill someone.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.424
Hello.

38:21.799 --> 38:27.066
Hey, Georgie boy.
Did you find Mickey Cohen yet?

38:29.507 --> 38:35.309
Tell him Biltmore Health Club at 1 :00.
We meet him there.

38:36.047 --> 38:40.074
Pick me up at noon? Good.

38:42.420 --> 38:47.153
You still think we'll bring each other
nothing but misery and torment?

38:47.425 --> 38:50.588
With a few distractions in between.

38:51.295 --> 38:54.389
You call what we've been doing
distractions?

38:55.032 --> 38:59.765
-Thank you, the feeling's mutual.
-Good, that's the way l like it.

39:02.073 --> 39:05.873
Twenty dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

39:06.077 --> 39:10.173
Twenty dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

39:10.381 --> 39:13.817
-Twenty-- What time is it?
-One thirty.

39:14.018 --> 39:17.317
That's a half an hour late.
Where is this thieving little schmuck?

39:17.521 --> 39:21.082
Who's a little schmuck?
Who are you referring to, fruitcake?

39:21.292 --> 39:23.522
-Hi, Mickey.
-You better show me some respect.

39:23.728 --> 39:28.529
Respect? l think you got it backward,
Mr. Cohen, if may correct you...

39:28.733 --> 39:32.328
...unless your idea of showing
a man respect is to rob his business.

39:32.636 --> 39:34.263
Who said l robbed?

39:34.472 --> 39:38.067
Robbed what, you would-be smoothie?
Everything l got is mine.

39:39.143 --> 39:41.737
lt's yours because
you stole it from me.

39:41.946 --> 39:43.641
Watch your words.

39:43.848 --> 39:46.282
What's mine is mine.
Everything l got, l'm keeping.

39:46.484 --> 39:49.942
l understand from Jack Dragna
you stole 56,000 and change.

39:52.223 --> 39:56.250
The lying fat fuck.
lt was 42, not 56.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.018
l thought you didn't steal it.

39:58.229 --> 40:01.460
l didn't. But if l had,
it would have been 42.

40:01.665 --> 40:05.863
lf l were you, l'd give
that money back by 7:00 tonight.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.836
Fuck you!
Look at me. Fuck you!

40:10.040 --> 40:14.807
And if l was you, l'd shut
my fucking mouth and watch my step.

40:15.012 --> 40:17.640
Or should l blow your Adam's apple
down your spine?

40:18.048 --> 40:20.676
Excuse me,
but aren't we in a public place?

40:20.885 --> 40:25.288
We'd both be better off
if you'd tone down your rhetoric.

40:25.489 --> 40:31.428
Maybe we'd both be better off if l left
and never saw your fucking face again.

40:34.665 --> 40:36.599
Why are you laughing?
This guy's deranged.

40:36.867 --> 40:41.133
Go get him. Bring him back.
Hurry up.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.368
Hey, Mickey. Mickey!

40:47.344 --> 40:49.938
Jack, it's Ben.

40:50.181 --> 40:52.206
l think l got the Cohen thing
under control.

40:52.416 --> 40:56.614
l want you to be at my house
at 7:30 tonight, all right? Good.

41:02.860 --> 41:07.058
George, how do you remember
all the fucking lines from a movie?

41:07.264 --> 41:09.289
l know you're big,
but make it quick, will you?

41:09.500 --> 41:12.628
l've got a hot date waiting for me.
l don't have time to schmooze.

41:12.837 --> 41:16.238
l bet you do have
a hot date waiting for you.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.032
-You making fun of me?
-Not at all.

41:18.576 --> 41:21.306
Guy with your balls must have
women lined up.

41:21.745 --> 41:23.940
Whatever the fuck that's
supposed to mean.

41:24.148 --> 41:27.208
When l go out with a broad,
you can bet she'll be a star.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.648
Like Betty Grable or Ava Gardner.

41:29.854 --> 41:33.551
l don't go for them tarty broads
like you and your pals back East do.

41:33.757 --> 41:35.281
What tarty broads?

41:35.493 --> 41:39.930
Shirley what's-her-name
that Charlie Luciano drags around.

41:40.130 --> 41:43.122
That nutty broad Joey A.
goes out with, Victoria Hill.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.303
That 6-foot blonde bimbo
that Moe--

41:46.504 --> 41:49.803
That's Virginia Hill.
Why would you call her a tart?

41:50.007 --> 41:55.707
That's what she is. Joe Epstein,
the drummer Gene Krupa...

41:55.913 --> 41:59.371
...the bullfighter from Mexico,
the Frenchman--

41:59.583 --> 42:02.518
-This conversation is beneath me.
-All right.

42:02.720 --> 42:07.680
Look, l'm expanding,
and if l'm gonna expand...

42:07.892 --> 42:11.885
...should l expand with guys who got
taken, or the one who took them?

42:12.496 --> 42:14.293
-What's in it for me?
-Money.

42:14.498 --> 42:18.195
-How much?
-Five thousand dollars a week.

42:19.770 --> 42:22.534
-Does that include a blowjob?
-Watch your mouth, Mickey.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.174
That's Ben Siegel.
You're lucky he don't plug you.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.743
He can't. He needs me.
Ain't you been listening?

42:28.946 --> 42:31.744
Or are you too busy learning lines
from those fairy acting jobs?

42:31.949 --> 42:33.678
-Six.
-Ten.

42:33.884 --> 42:37.718
All right, but l want the $42,000
you stole back by 7:00 tonight.

42:37.955 --> 42:42.153
l put up my life and my liberty
on that fucking score.

42:42.359 --> 42:43.849
l'll give back 20.

42:44.061 --> 42:46.621
The whole 42, l wouldn't kick it back
if you was my mother.

42:46.830 --> 42:49.128
A penny less, we got no deal.

42:59.977 --> 43:02.775
How would he know she fucked
Gene Krupa and a bullfighter?

43:03.147 --> 43:06.344
Well, it ain't exactly confidential info,
baby blue-eyes.

43:06.550 --> 43:10.919
Krupa l know about,
and a couple of bullfighters.

43:14.325 --> 43:17.692
-A couple of bullfighters?
-That's what l heard.

43:19.663 --> 43:21.460
-Did you ever fuck her?
-What?

43:22.032 --> 43:24.796
Did you ever fuck Virginia?

43:25.002 --> 43:26.435
-Of course not.
-Why not?

43:27.438 --> 43:29.429
-What kind of question is that?
-A direct one.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.938
Why did you not fuck Virginia?
ls she not attractive?

43:32.142 --> 43:34.303
-Of course she is.
-Then why didn't you fuck her?

43:35.012 --> 43:37.742
This is ridiculous.
There's a million attractive broads.

43:37.948 --> 43:39.347
l don't have to ball them all.

43:39.550 --> 43:43.008
l don't care why you didn't ball them.
Why didn't you fuck Virginia?

43:43.220 --> 43:44.915
-She's your girl.
-You knew her before.

43:45.122 --> 43:46.885
She was Joey A.'s girl.
Satisfied now?

43:53.998 --> 43:55.590
You think you could've fucked her?

43:55.799 --> 43:58.324
How do l know, Ben?
You never know unless you try.

43:58.535 --> 44:01.698
Oh, yes, you do. You know.
Could you have fucked her or not?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.740
-My hunch?
-Yeah.

44:04.942 --> 44:06.739
-Possibly.
-Possibly or probably?

44:06.944 --> 44:09.037
-Probably, l'm guessing.
-Probably or definitely?

44:09.246 --> 44:11.942
Probably. Definitely not definitely,
that l'm sure of.

44:14.585 --> 44:18.282
She is who she is.
What man ever changed a woman?

44:18.489 --> 44:23.324
l don't go by what other men have
done. l believe in fresh starts.

44:23.594 --> 44:29.157
Without them, you and me would have
been history before we were 1 9.

44:31.168 --> 44:35.537
l hope you like scampi
served on a bed of soft brown rice.

44:36.573 --> 44:39.804
Rimmed by carrots and peas.

44:40.611 --> 44:42.909
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

44:44.615 --> 44:48.483
Come on, eat.
lt'll make you big and strong.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.581
What do you think of bullfighting?

44:55.759 --> 45:00.162
-lt's been a while since l tried it.
-What are your memories?

45:00.364 --> 45:05.267
-Dangerous, and fun.
-What about drums?

45:07.438 --> 45:12.068
-What about drums? l'm a singer.
-You ever sing with a drummer?

45:14.278 --> 45:18.374
l've sung with all kinds of musicians.
Your dinner's getting cold.

45:18.582 --> 45:20.209
lt's already cold.

45:32.162 --> 45:34.255
Were you under the impression
l was a virgin?

45:34.765 --> 45:37.598
No, l just thought maybe there
was somebody you hadn't fucked.

46:03.694 --> 46:05.685
That's not pleasant.

46:05.896 --> 46:07.261
You listen to me, mister.

46:07.831 --> 46:12.791
We've both fucked around.
You want to trade stories, fine.

46:13.003 --> 46:15.369
You wanna bury the past,
we can do that too.

46:15.572 --> 46:18.336
But don't try playing
these sulky little games.

46:18.542 --> 46:23.912
lf what we share isn't good enough,
then we should call it quits now.

46:24.114 --> 46:27.641
-What'll it be?
-How about iodine?

46:29.153 --> 46:30.711
You need some soap and water.

46:30.921 --> 46:33.856
And wash out your fucking mouth too.
l'm going home.

46:36.160 --> 46:40.153
Wait. Wait a minute.
Where are you going? Come here.

46:40.364 --> 46:43.697
Damn it, let go of me!
l'm not staying here.

46:51.875 --> 46:54.503
Get your hands off me, goddamn it!

46:54.745 --> 46:59.739
Goddamn it, let go of me!
l'm never coming back.

47:01.752 --> 47:03.686
Hey, Benny.

47:11.495 --> 47:14.362
-Hey, Ben. You okay?
-l'm fine.

47:16.166 --> 47:19.499
-42,000 on the nose.
-Thank you very much.

47:19.703 --> 47:23.002
This is Virginia Hill.
Mickey Cohen.

47:23.207 --> 47:27.473
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
l've heard a lot about you.

47:27.678 --> 47:31.478
-Want me to come in?
-Mind if l took a rain check?

47:32.316 --> 47:35.683
Not under the circumstances.
What happened to your head?

47:35.919 --> 47:38.854
A vicious insect.
l'll see you in the morning.

47:56.740 --> 48:00.699
Hey, goombah, kiss my tukus!

48:07.618 --> 48:09.609
Fucking Jew prick.

48:17.694 --> 48:20.527
-Did you ever meet Jack Dragna?
-No.

48:20.898 --> 48:24.891
Good. l've gotta speak to him alone.
Will you wait for me?

48:25.769 --> 48:28.203
-What for?
-Will you wait for me, please?

48:33.977 --> 48:35.842
ln there.

48:44.154 --> 48:47.123
That cocksucking thief
dished it back.

48:47.324 --> 48:49.792
-Every cent.
-No kidding?

48:49.993 --> 48:54.453
l'll be a son of a bitch.
How did you get him to go along?

48:54.665 --> 48:57.896
He brought me the money,
l gave him a job.

48:58.168 --> 48:59.362
What job?

49:00.137 --> 49:02.662
Running the day-to-day mechanics
of my operation.

49:03.507 --> 49:07.307
-That's my job.
-No, you work for him now.

49:08.078 --> 49:10.740
-Am l missing something?
-You certainly are.

49:10.948 --> 49:13.849
About $ 1 4,000 and change.

49:14.051 --> 49:18.886
The 1 4,000 you stole from us,
after the 42 that Mickey took.

49:19.089 --> 49:21.319
-Wait a minute--
-Do you wanna fuck me?

49:21.525 --> 49:24.255
-What?
-That's a simple question, isn't it?

49:24.461 --> 49:26.986
-Of course not.
-No?

49:27.197 --> 49:29.165
-You're sure?
-Of course l'm sure.

49:29.366 --> 49:32.358
Well, let me ask you this:
Do you wanna rape me?

49:32.569 --> 49:36.665
-This is crazy.
-Answer me. Do not lie to me.

49:36.873 --> 49:41.173
You stole from me. You stole,
and stealing is a form of rape.

49:41.378 --> 49:45.838
Did you think you could get away
with stealing from me?

49:46.049 --> 49:50.179
From Meyer Lansky, Charlie Luciano
and me, and get away with it?

49:50.387 --> 49:54.517
That you could rape us and humiliate
us and get away with that?

49:54.725 --> 49:58.923
Did you think you could
get away with it or not? Do not lie!

49:59.129 --> 50:00.858
-Do not lie to me!
-l'm not lying.

50:02.065 --> 50:06.434
That means you raped us even though
you thought we would catch you?

50:06.636 --> 50:12.700
-lt wasn't like that.
-What was it like? Answer me!

50:12.943 --> 50:16.538
Did you think you could
get away with it or not? Did you?

50:16.747 --> 50:18.908
-Did you or not?
-l won't. l won't.

50:19.116 --> 50:21.016
-You won't what?
-l won't ever do it again!

50:21.218 --> 50:26.349
''Again.'' You won't do it again.
How do you know l won't kill you?

50:27.324 --> 50:30.350
l'm begging you, Ben. Don't.
Don't do it.

50:30.560 --> 50:34.394
What do you want? Wanna kill me?
You want another chance?

50:34.798 --> 50:37.528
Let me tell you something.
You can't.

50:37.734 --> 50:41.465
No one can. l can't kill me.

50:42.472 --> 50:45.873
See? Now, try it.
Come on, give it to me.

50:46.076 --> 50:47.475
-l can't.
-Come on, do it.

50:47.677 --> 50:50.612
Why? What is it?
Are you afraid to die?

50:51.214 --> 50:54.479
Crawl. Crawl. Come on.

50:54.684 --> 51:00.054
Now bark like the dog that you wish
that you were decent enough to be.

51:00.257 --> 51:05.024
Bark! Bark! Bark! Come on.
Crawl and bark.

51:05.228 --> 51:07.093
More. Let me hear that bark.

51:08.965 --> 51:13.299
Come on, give me more. Louder!

51:13.503 --> 51:18.873
Yes, yes, yes, that's good. More!

51:19.776 --> 51:23.906
Now oink like the treacherous,
devious pig that you are.

51:24.114 --> 51:27.606
Come on. Come on,
get around there. Oink.

51:27.818 --> 51:31.083
Now! Oink! Oink! Oink!

51:31.855 --> 51:33.755
Yes, yes, yes.

51:38.595 --> 51:41.723
Get up! Get up!

51:44.167 --> 51:46.328
Now look me in the eye.

51:47.537 --> 51:51.439
Go home, get the money you stole
and you bring it to me.

51:53.577 --> 51:55.977
This goes back in the safe
at the betting parlor.

51:56.880 --> 52:00.646
Thanks, Ben.
You can count on me for anything.

52:00.851 --> 52:04.309
We'll see. Everybody needs
a fresh start once in a while.

52:07.324 --> 52:08.951
Get out.

52:43.527 --> 52:45.495
Are we gonna eat?

54:35.572 --> 54:38.939
Who was the Countess Di Frasso?

54:40.176 --> 54:41.905
Who was the Countess Di Frasso?

54:42.212 --> 54:44.077
-You're asking me--?
-Yeah. Who is she?

54:44.281 --> 54:47.011
She's the wife of that count,
the Count Di Frasso.

54:47.217 --> 54:51.620
-l danced with her at Ciro's.
-l know you danced with her.

54:51.821 --> 54:58.283
The countess's husband, the count,
is a very good friend of Mussolini.

54:58.495 --> 55:00.156
So?

55:00.363 --> 55:02.456
The countess's husband...

55:02.666 --> 55:06.295
-...is Mussolini's friend.
-l got it the first time. So what?

55:06.503 --> 55:12.135
Hitler and Mussolini are destroying
the world. l can stop Mussolini.

55:12.375 --> 55:14.536
-What do you mean?
-What do you think l mean?

55:14.744 --> 55:19.306
-Kill him? Kill Mussolini?
-l'm using the count to get to him.

55:19.516 --> 55:23.953
You are going to kill Mussolini
personally in the middle of a war?

55:24.154 --> 55:27.783
That is the most pathetic, asinine,
ludicrous excuse l've ever heard.

55:27.991 --> 55:30.425
You wanna fuck some countess,
have the guts to say it...

55:30.627 --> 55:33.027
...then go and do it.
Fuck yourself while you're at it.

55:33.229 --> 55:35.197
You don't get it.
l'm hatching a secret plan.

55:35.398 --> 55:38.731
-You're full of secrets, aren't you?
-What do you mean, ''secrets''?

55:38.935 --> 55:41.927
-Things not out in the open.
-What's not out in the open?

55:42.138 --> 55:43.332
-Me.
-You?

55:43.540 --> 55:46.134
You're afraid to be seen with me.
l'm a fucking secret.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.402
-From who?
-''From who.'' You know who.

55:48.611 --> 55:51.273
You told me you don't
keep any secrets from Esta.

55:51.481 --> 55:54.143
-Esta? That's different.
-Because l'm a secret from her.

55:54.351 --> 55:57.548
That's not what l want.
l don't wanna be anybody's secret!

55:57.754 --> 55:59.745
You're nobody's secret.
Give me a chance.

55:59.956 --> 56:01.685
You had your chance.

56:01.891 --> 56:04.655
-We never go anywhere.
-All right, we'll go everywhere.

56:04.861 --> 56:06.351
-Everywhere?
-Everywhere.

56:07.063 --> 56:11.796
Give me a chance. Everybody
deserves a fresh start once in a while.

56:23.079 --> 56:27.709
-Come on, sugar. Let's go.
-l can't. You don't understand.

56:27.917 --> 56:33.514
l'm sorry, l can't, Ben.
l'm really much too nervous.

56:33.723 --> 56:37.056
-Come on. Let's go.
-l thought l could, but l can't.

56:37.260 --> 56:39.785
-You can't what?
-Do it. l can't do it.

56:39.996 --> 56:42.430
Now l see the plane, l can't.
You have to understand.

56:43.099 --> 56:44.589
-l never have.
-Never what?

56:44.801 --> 56:46.132
Been on a plane.

56:46.336 --> 56:49.100
You've never been on a plane?
One second.

56:49.305 --> 56:51.933
l can't control you.
You're gonna do what you do.

56:52.142 --> 56:55.202
l can't be with you every second.
l can't be a watchdog.

56:55.412 --> 56:56.743
-Ben!
-Go without me.

56:56.946 --> 56:59.574
We're gonna run out of gas
before we get off the ground.

56:59.783 --> 57:02.684
l just wanna explain to you
the basic rules of aerodynamics.

57:02.886 --> 57:07.482
No. lt would make no difference.
l'm not going on the plane.

57:11.261 --> 57:15.027
Ben, let's go.

57:16.933 --> 57:19.231
Come on. Time is money.

57:36.019 --> 57:39.580
This is the most boring drive
l've been on, and l have to pee.

57:39.789 --> 57:42.121
lf we'd flown, we'd have been there
three hours ago.

57:42.325 --> 57:45.783
Sorry. l should've let you two go.
l don't even know why l came.

57:45.995 --> 57:48.361
l don't even know why l came.
Why did l come?

57:48.565 --> 57:52.763
You had to. You can't run an operation
in Nevada and never go to Nevada.

58:19.295 --> 58:24.927
We drove five and a half hours
for this canker sore?

58:26.636 --> 58:30.800
lt may not look it, but there's
a steady profit coming out of this joint.

58:31.007 --> 58:34.204
lt's got steady customers with
nowhere else to spend their money.

58:34.444 --> 58:37.538
You wanna have this kind of dump?
l think you should get rid of it.

58:38.781 --> 58:41.113
We got nothing to lose.
The upkeep is almost zero.

58:41.317 --> 58:44.252
Who would have thought,
it looks like a fortune is spent here.

58:44.454 --> 58:47.082
That's not the point.
Looks don't matter if there's money.

58:47.524 --> 58:51.620
Looks matter if it matters how you look.
l think it should be burned.

58:51.828 --> 58:53.557
l wouldn't go that far, Victoria.

58:54.631 --> 58:59.068
Vic-what? Do me a favor,
call Virginia Virginia. Not Victoria.

58:59.269 --> 59:02.170
l called her Virginia.
What did l call you?

59:02.372 --> 59:04.704
-You called me Victoria.
-l called you Victoria?

59:04.908 --> 59:06.273
-Call her Virginia.
-Excuse me.

59:06.476 --> 59:09.934
-Find the guy l gotta talk to.
-All right.

59:12.315 --> 59:15.648
l have no need
to hear what you have to say.

59:15.852 --> 59:18.446
Fine. Excuse me,
who took whose advice?

59:18.655 --> 59:20.850
Don't embarrass me that way
in front of people.

59:21.057 --> 59:24.754
-l was right.
-No, the place should've stayed open.

59:24.994 --> 59:27.485
-Then why did you close it?
-Because you were right too.

59:27.697 --> 59:31.463
lt is a canker sore.
But it made me look like your puppet.

59:31.668 --> 59:35.195
Maybe you need someone
to tell you what to do.

59:35.405 --> 59:40.069
Or maybe you want to continue
dodging your way through two lives.

59:40.276 --> 59:44.576
Checking at home in Scarsdale
whenever you get too lonely.

59:44.781 --> 59:46.976
-Or maybe you're just getting old.
-All right.

59:47.183 --> 59:52.678
That's it. l've taken enough shit
off of you, and it's gonna stop now.

59:52.889 --> 59:56.848
-Hot air in a hot desert.
-lt's gonna stop right now.

59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.723
Don't talk to me about Scarsdale,
it's none of your business.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.921
l don't need this shit
about Scarsdale.

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:09.665
Talking to me about Scarsdale.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:35.087
-What is he doing?
-Looking for a place to take a leak.

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:56.178
l got it!

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:59.012
l got it! lt came to me like a vision!

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:01.053
Like a religious epiphany.

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.884
Are you talking about God?

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:06.728
l am talking about
the single best idea l ever had.

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:09.727
Yeah, well l just had
the greatest single idea l ever had.

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:22.310
-lsn't she magnificent?
-Just what l've been looking for.

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:27.438
A broad to leave me in the desert,
to die and be eaten by vultures.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.175
Mickey, you're gonna
remember this day.

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:04.379
Benjy, what would we do in ltaly
with all those bullets flying around?

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:09.047
What we would do in ltaly?
We would meet Mussolini.

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:12.728
You are outrageous.
That's what l love about you.

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:23.468
Why do you want to meet the duce?

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:26.699
l got some friends in Naples,
they could use his help.

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:28.604
Now, all l wanna know is...

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:33.646
...could your husband arrange that,
or are his connections exaggerated?

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:43.121
My husband could get you this close
to Mussolini any time he wishes.

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:46.227
And he will wish to do
whatever l say.

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:53.262
l'm very intuitive. You know
what my intuition tells me about you?

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:57.269
That you always get
whatever you want.

01:02:57.473 --> 01:03:01.102
Don't deny it.
l find your confidence irresistible.

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:04.507
l find myself sucked in by it.

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:06.545
Helpless, if you must
know the truth.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.047
Excuse me.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:27.635
We got a few wrinkles to iron out,
but my secret plan is going through.

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:31.596
l'm going to New York tomorrow,
thought l'd say hello and goodbye.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.173
Hello and goodbye.

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:36.438
You know, l got some
real problems in New York.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:41.674
Charlie's been arrested.
Harry Greenberg, my old friend...

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:46.014
-...l think he testified against him.
-Am l supposed to be interested?

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:51.383
What does your friend do,
he sticks knives into animals?

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:56.327
He's the guitarist.
Flamenco-Flamingo.

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:59.023
You're not actually spending the night
with this creep?

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:00.395
l demand a retraction.

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:03.936
What l do with my time and my body
is my business. Sit down, Alejandro.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.041
-l demand satisfaction.
-Would this satisfy you, sweetie?

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:11.145
Take a hike, will you?
Go back to your countess, hypocrite.

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:14.145
l hope she gives you syphilis.
Let's get out of here, Alejandro.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:17.012
-l'm asking Esta for a divorce.
-Better get to a phone.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.383
-But l'm doing it in New York.
-Good luck.

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.948
Virginia....

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:29.726
l was wearing a blue silk shirt?
l don't even own a blue silk shirt.

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:34.798
l was ''brandishing a .45 menacingly.''

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:39.566
What an outrageous fabrication.
lt wasn't a .45, it was a .38.

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:44.803
l was not brandishing it.
l was concealing it, to make a point.

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:48.040
What kind of vile,
despicable people write this?

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:53.186
l agree with you 1 00 percent.
They've got no morals, those people.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.255
Benny, everything we heard is true.

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:02.898
Charlie's in jail because of
this rat bastard stool-pigeon.

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:10.695
You know this Harry Greenberg?
You don't know him?

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.273
l know him, all right?

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:16.445
Mickey, l'm getting a divorce.
That's why l'm making this trip.

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:19.137
l'm definitely getting a divorce.

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:23.819
-Definitely?
-Definitely.

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:27.886
What?

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.418
-l'm sorry to hear that.
-Why? Why?

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:37.827
To see a family break up like that,
l'm sorry.

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:40.366
What gotta be, gotta be.

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:56.614
-l know what you're doing.
-Don't come one step closer.

01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:00.322
You're writing ''Happy Birthday,
Millicent'' on my birthday cake.

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:04.459
Will you get out of here?
Set the table.

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:07.595
-Where did you put the presents?
-With the potatoes.

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:09.961
Presents are with the potatoes.

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:23.944
-Honey, move the thing in the middle.
-Okay.

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:32.881
-l hope we're not disturbing you.
-lt's Millicent's birthday party.

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:37.287
-There's a matter we must discuss.
-l've gotta talk to you too. Come on in.

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:40.418
Come on in. Come on.

01:06:40.629 --> 01:06:46.625
Make yourselves at home.
l'll be right with you.

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:52.906
Guess who that is. Meyer, Joey A.,
Frank, Gus, Vito and Moe.

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:54.906
l thought this night was
for ourselves.

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:58.239
l'm sorry, Esta.
l planned to meet tomorrow, but....

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:00.381
Does Meyer know
it's Millicent's birthday?

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:05.350
Well, l told him, but l think they got
problem with a business thing l did.

01:07:05.554 --> 01:07:10.014
Finish the cake, put the candles on,
l'll be right back.

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:15.157
Before we get to what's important,
l gotta tell you guys...

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:17.855
...l got rid of that seedy canker sore
in Las Vegas.

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:21.901
That's why we came. You had
no right to give that casino up.

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:26.234
-Casino? lt was an outhouse.
-You should have consulted us.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:30.008
-That's the arrangement we got.
-l got no arrangement with you, Vito.

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:32.180
l have an arrangement
with Meyer and Charlie.

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:36.181
But don't worry. When l tell you
what l'm gonna build in its place...

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:39.548
...you'll understand for the first time
the meaning of ''transcendent.''

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:41.313
Tell us now.

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:49.125
Meyer, l have found the answer
to the dreams of America.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:52.858
You wanna be a little more specific?

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:55.537
-The Flamingo.
-A bird?

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:59.299
What do people fantasize about?
Sex, romance, money, adventure.

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:02.568
-l'm building a monument to them.
-Are you talking about a whorehouse?

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:05.713
l'm talking about a hotel.
l'm talking about Las Vegas, Nevada.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.713
A place where gambling is allowed.
Where everything is allowed.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:12.854
The whole territory is wide open.
A palace, an oasis, a city.

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:15.421
When the Hoover Dam is finished...

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:19.116
...electrical power will be available
on a massive scale in Las Vegas.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:23.457
The Hoover Dam and fucking
are connected how?

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:26.635
By air-conditioning.
lt's the wave of the future.

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:31.136
Everything will be air-cooled.
Every room 72 degrees at all times.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.934
The casino?
We'll put Monte Carlo to shame.

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:37.703
Wall-to-wall carpeting, ltalian marble,
badminton courts, stables.

01:08:37.912 --> 01:08:41.212
We'll have a lightning-fast train
from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:45.113
Planes back and forth.
Meyer, we'll have our own airport!

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:49.758
What Ben's saying is, it's a good place
to trap people in to take their money.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:53.986
-ls that what you're getting at here?
-Much more. Much more.

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:57.595
l gotta get that.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.292
l got it! l got it! Hello.

01:09:02.203 --> 01:09:06.140
Mickey, have you got someone
across the street from her house?

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:10.310
Call Warner Bros., call Ciro's.
Find out if anybody's seen her.

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:14.040
Then call me back.
No, not five minutes. One minute.

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:23.715
Sit tight. Sit tight, honey.
Let me just see how they're doing.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:28.990
How's it--? Oh, that looks great.
Your mother's a real artist.

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:32.166
l'm gonna run back,
l got these guys going on this thing--

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:36.828
The children don't have the patience
that some adults do.

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:41.406
You finish the candles in here,
l'll finish out there. We'll be ready.

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:46.544
Don't you move,
my little birthday girl.

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:50.845
l don't understand this desert thing.
What are we, Bedouins?

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:52.850
Let's concentrate on Cuba.

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:57.355
You got legalized gambling
next to Florida. lt's like another state.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:02.793
But it's not another state. A foreign
country can always throw you out.

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:06.126
Nevada is another state
and it's open.

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:09.566
lf we do this thing right,
if we follow the hotel with schools...

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:13.731
...and churches and synagogues,
the things that give a city backbone...

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.706
...we'll be in charge
before you know it.

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:18.572
-ln charge of what?
-The state!

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:21.511
And if you got a state,
the country is within your reach.

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.207
You planning to run for president?

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:26.752
We can help to choose the president
if we control a state.

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:30.585
Why be bogged down by limitations?
Open your eyes to the horizons.

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:34.752
Where do you think the money
for this is gonna come from?

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:37.865
Since l'm doing the work
and the partners share the success...

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.762
...the money should come
from them.

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:41.766
-''Them'' meaning who?
-''Them'' meaning you.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.371
-How much are we talking about?
-One million dollars.

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:49.237
What about the publicity?
A place like this will cause a lot of talk.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:51.606
Ben's getting very famous
out in California.

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:56.945
Famous is good for Clark Gable,
but for you it's not good.

01:10:57.186 --> 01:11:00.053
The Flamingo will make
our gambling interests legitimate.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:04.158
Meyer, we've known each other
since we were too young to fuck.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:10.321
When did l ever ask you to leap
ahead with something on faith?

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:14.662
Never, but l'm asking you now.
Do this.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:23.207
Mickey, you mean to tell me l've got
you and 65 guys on my payroll...

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:25.903
...and nobody can find Virginia?

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:32.778
Listen. l cannot function effectively
when l'm in a state of ignorance.

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:34.546
Find her.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:43.656
Hold the fort. l'm nearly finished.
What's the matter?

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.962
l thought you came home
to be with me on my birthday.

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:50.366
l did. l am spending time with you
on your birthday.

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:52.096
l just gotta finish this meeting--

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:57.177
-l don't want to hear you!
-Millicent! Come on, honey.

01:11:58.614 --> 01:12:02.516
We're just gonna be a minute--
Come on, honey.

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:06.950
Millicent, open the door.
l just wanna say one thing, okay?

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:09.482
Barbara, are you in there too?

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:14.256
Just come on down
and l'll light the candles.

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:17.796
l'm gonna light the candles.
l'm lighting the candles.

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:22.731
Come on down,
l'm lighting the candles.

01:12:23.572 --> 01:12:27.838
Sorry the party got a little
out of control, but l fixed it.

01:12:28.043 --> 01:12:33.208
With Charlie in jail, l'll have to
confer with him on money decisions.

01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:38.717
But pending his approval, l'm happy
to say you've got yourself a deal.

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:42.379
-Good. Great.
-When will you get started?

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:45.151
When l get back from ltaly.
l'm going over in a week.

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:47.386
That, plus however long that takes.

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:52.397
-However long what takes?
-The assassination of Mussolini.

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:55.866
Who's gonna
assassinate Mussolini?

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:05.307
Come here. Look, don't fuck this up
by trying to be funny.

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:08.711
Mussolini and Hitler are trying
to knock off every Jew on earth.

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:11.385
lf l don't do something, who will?
A bunch of ltalians?

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:15.751
-l can stop Mussolini.
-Leave it to the Allied Forces.

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:19.121
You're missing the point.
The Allied Forces don't have access.

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:21.853
-l have the access.
-You have the access?

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.828
One of Mussolini's best friends
is the Count Di Frasso.

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:28.230
The Count Di Frasso's wife
has the hots for me.

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:33.670
She'll get me close to Mussolini,
l'll blow him halfway to Siberia.

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:35.776
Listen to me very carefully.

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:39.142
Don't ever repeat what you just said
to me to anybody else.

01:13:39.815 --> 01:13:43.216
-That's right, it's a secret.
-l'm saying it for a different reason.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.579
Why are you saying it?

01:13:44.787 --> 01:13:49.019
Because, at best,
any normal person you say it to...

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:53.388
...will never take anything you say
seriously again. So nothing more.

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:58.225
Sure, but Mussolini is a dead man.
l'll be with you in a minute.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:03.235
l'm gonna light the candles.
l'm lighting the candles.

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:09.402
-Let's see what Meyer wants.
-What do you want to eat?

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:12.944
We didn't come here to eat.
We came here to do business.

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:25.591
Millicent? l lit the candles.

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:32.328
-Have we finished our business?
-Sure, we shouldn't have barged in.

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:37.028
Enjoy the party for Millicent.
We'll talk tomorrow. lt sounds good.

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:40.106
-Take care, Ben.
-Thanks for coming by.

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:49.177
Joey. Listen,
l'm sorry about Virginia.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:53.979
lf you wanna take a punch at me,
take a punch at me.

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:03.789
We're even now. l'm sorry,
l know you were in love with her.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:09.130
Are you kidding? l'd never let myself
fall in love with a slut like her.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:50.235
Your mouth is bleeding.

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:55.016
l tripped, l whacked it on the table.
lt's nothing.

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:59.448
l don't think
we can go on like this, Ben.

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:05.150
-Like what?
-Should we get a divorce?

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:12.398
Some friends just dropped by at the
wrong time. Everything's fine now.

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.468
Sit down.

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:24.671
l'm gonna go say good night
to the girls.

01:16:25.305 --> 01:16:31.314
