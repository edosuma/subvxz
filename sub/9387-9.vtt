WEBVTT

00:35.035 --> 00:36.870
Oh, Peter, you're selling your anvil?

00:36.954 --> 00:39.331
Yeah, I've had a lot of good times
with this thing.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.001
(CHUCKLING)

00:43.085 --> 00:44.920
Oh, a dollar!

00:45.212 --> 00:47.840
-Hey, there, Chris.
-Hi, Mr. Herbert.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.425
-Selling your old hand-me-downs?
-Yep.

00:50.509 --> 00:53.345
You got anything
you used to wear in the summertime?

00:53.428 --> 00:56.890
-Just these old shorts.
-Sweet Jesus.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.018
-Give you $1 for this.
-Sold.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.233
Brian, where's Rupert?
I just left him here to watch my things.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.317
Uh-oh.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.236
-What?
-Nothing, I haven't seen him.

01:09.319 --> 01:13.657
It's not like him to wander off.
Rupert? Rupert! Oh, no.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.909
-What if he's been kidnapped?
-Well, let's just calm down.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.078
I've got to save him, Brian.
What if he's dead?

01:18.161 --> 01:19.955
I don't think I can handle a funeral.

01:21.582 --> 01:25.711
Of all the souls I have encountered
in my travels, his was the most

01:27.421 --> 01:28.589
human.

01:28.672 --> 01:29.965
MAN: Orders.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.884
(BAGPIPE PLAYING
AMAZING GRACE)

01:59.536 --> 02:01.955
Holy crap. Evel Knievel gloves.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.540
I bet I could do a wheelie with these.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.375
-How much for the gloves?
-Peter, those are yours.

02:05.459 --> 02:09.171
$10, $2, $7, $4, $5.50, $10. Sold.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.633
Sucker. I would've gone to $15, easy.
I am so stupid.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.468
Awesome.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.138
Peter, you can't drive a car over that.
You're gonna get hurt.

02:18.222 --> 02:21.350
Lois, I don't come down to Burger King
and tell you how to do your job.

02:21.433 --> 02:22.559
Peter, I don't work at Burger...

02:22.643 --> 02:25.395
"I don't work at Burger..." I'm busy.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.732
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some death to defy.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.913
Wow. This is just like what happened with
Matthew Broderick, except no one's dead.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.543
(DOORBELL RINGING)

02:48.126 --> 02:49.837
-Hey, Joe.
-Good morning, Peter.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.756
-I'm here to revoke your driver's license.
-What? Why?

02:52.840 --> 02:55.425
We got reckless driving,
disturbing the peace,

02:55.509 --> 02:58.178
plus the driver of one of those other cars
was a virgin

02:58.262 --> 03:00.931
whose hymen was busted by the airbag,
so rape.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.559
Okay, well, I guess
you can take my license.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.978
-'Course, it's all the way up here.
-Peter, knock it off. Give it to me.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.855
-Right here. Here you go, Officer.
-Give me the damn license.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.022
Don't you want it? Here.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.774
-This is in poor taste, Peter.
-Having some trouble there?

03:10.858 --> 03:11.984
-You're starting to piss me off.
-All you gotta do is take it.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.819
-You're starting to piss me off!
-It's right here.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.909
Oh, man, this sucks. I got no license.
I can't go anywhere.

03:20.993 --> 03:24.037
Well, this is your own fault, Peter,
and if you want my opinion,

03:24.121 --> 03:27.124
a little time away from the bar
will do you some good.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.710
I'll show her.
I'll just go to another bar.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.670
MAN ON TV: We now return to Cheers.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.088
-Norm.
-Norm.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.798
And Peter. Yeah.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.509
-How's life in the fast lane,
Mr. Peterson? -Griffin.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.219
I can't find the on-ramp, Woody.

03:39.303 --> 03:43.515
He was talking to me, Norm. Quit stealing
my punch lines, you fat drunk.

03:43.599 --> 03:47.227
That show stopped being funny
after Kirstie Alley ate Shelley Long.

03:47.311 --> 03:51.190
Oh, man, now I can't even watch TV.
What the hell am I gonna do all day?

03:51.273 --> 03:53.567
That's all right, that's okay.
I don't need TV.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.694
I'll just make my own sitcom in my head.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.655
And I'll give it
an upbeat '80s sitcom theme.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.494
This time around I'm staying at home

04:04.578 --> 04:07.706
And things are gonna get better

04:07.789 --> 04:10.751
Settling in, loving my wife

04:10.834 --> 04:14.004
But then I got that letter

04:14.129 --> 04:16.757
My black son, my black son

04:17.049 --> 04:20.302
Now each day my heart is getting bigger

04:20.385 --> 04:24.848
Don't even remember
sleeping with that lady, but I did

04:24.932 --> 04:27.935
My black son, he's coming to stay

04:28.101 --> 04:33.273
My black son, he's making each day

04:33.398 --> 04:34.983
The best that he can

04:35.067 --> 04:36.735
Also, he's a ninja

04:42.115 --> 04:44.076
Why have you brought me
to the toy store, Brian?

04:44.159 --> 04:45.827
I'm buying you another Rupert.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.246
Hey, this one's cute, huh?

04:47.329 --> 04:50.249
And if we buy it,
they save a real gorilla in the wild.

04:50.332 --> 04:53.460
And if we don't, they kill one.
Wow, these guys are playing hardball.

04:53.544 --> 04:57.339
You can't just take some Korean-made
velveteen primate and call it Rupert.

04:57.422 --> 05:01.051
Now, come on, this is all time we could
be using to find Rupert's kidnappers.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.221
Look, I may as well come clean with you.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.931
Rupert wasn't kidnapped.

05:06.014 --> 05:09.184
I accidentally sold him at the yard sale.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.270
You son of a bitch!

05:11.436 --> 05:12.938
(WAILING)

05:18.277 --> 05:20.612
Come on, Stewie,
I'm really sorry. It was an accident.

05:20.696 --> 05:23.365
Damn you, Brian.
How could you sell Rupert?

05:23.448 --> 05:26.577
What you've done is more horrible
than sex with Sharon Stone.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.370
Wow, that was great.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.372
One minute I'm filling up at Chevron,

05:30.455 --> 05:32.499
and the next
I'm having sex with Sharon Stone.

05:32.583 --> 05:35.085
Yeah. Now comes the best part.

05:43.135 --> 05:47.014
-Get out of the fridge, Peter.
-There is no Peter, only Zuul.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.933
-I said get out of the fridge.
-All right, all right.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.977
Jeez, Lois,
I'm just trying to amuse myself,

05:52.060 --> 05:53.770
since I don't have
a damn driver's license.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.772
Look, Peter,
it's getting a little annoying

05:55.856 --> 05:57.399
having you around the house all the time.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.652
So you'll be happy to know
I got you your own personal driver.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.405
My own driver?
Holy crap, that's awesome.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.991
-Where is he?
-She's right here, Peter.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.451
-Meg?
-Yeah, Dad.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.661
I don't mind driving you around
till you get your license back.

06:09.745 --> 06:12.164
What? Lois, this is the best you could do?

06:12.247 --> 06:15.125
Well, it was either Meg
or a talking monkey smoking a cigar,

06:15.209 --> 06:16.960
but I didn't think you'd like that.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.463
I've already accepted another job.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.591
Lois, you picked the opposite thing
that I would like.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.385
It's all right.
I would've driven you bananas.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.347
Oh, and he makes jokes. Nice going, Lois.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.432
Dad, are you ready?

06:33.602 --> 06:36.355
-What exactly are you trying to do?
-It's very simple, Brian.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.608
I've taken DNA from the dollar bill
you were paid for Rupert.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.736
Now to check that DNA
against the federal database.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.071
We have a match.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.157
"Stanford Cordray, 89 Spooner Street."

06:47.241 --> 06:49.451
Well, that's only a few blocks away.
Let's go!

06:53.956 --> 06:55.040
(DOORBELL RINGING)

06:55.123 --> 06:56.625
Hello? Hello?

06:58.627 --> 07:00.629
It can't be. This house is deserted.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.841
He moved. He's gone.

07:03.966 --> 07:09.221
-Rupert's gone.
-Wait a minute. Look! The moving truck.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.015
-We're not too late.
-Hey! Hey!

07:13.934 --> 07:15.727
Can I help you, gentlemen?

07:15.811 --> 07:17.479
Follow that truck.

07:17.855 --> 07:19.565
Didn't you hear me?
I said, "Follow that truck."

07:19.648 --> 07:23.569
Oh, I heard you.
What I didn't hear was "please."

07:23.652 --> 07:25.654
-Please follow the truck.
-Please follow the truck.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.784
I always enjoy traveling companions.

07:30.868 --> 07:34.913
Let's play 20 questions. Am I Bo Bice?
Yes, I am.

07:34.997 --> 07:37.833
Well played, worthy adversary.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.049
We're gaining on him. I'm coming, Rupert.

07:49.386 --> 07:52.764
-I'm sorry, but I can go no further.
-What? Why not?

07:52.848 --> 07:53.932
If I enter Connecticut,

07:54.016 --> 07:57.811
I'm entering every state
that Connecticut's ever been with.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.897
Good luck, brave travelers.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.027
No! We were so close.

08:09.698 --> 08:13.285
I say, what a bit of serendipity.
Now we've got that fellow's address.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.621
Let's see. "Aspen, Colorado."

08:15.704 --> 08:18.290
Well, you can forget that.
We're not going all the way to Aspen.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.626
What? But I can't leave Rupert to perish.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.170
For the rest of my life,
I'll be as lonely as Pat Robertson

08:23.253 --> 08:25.422
and Jerry Falwell, after the rapture.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.133
Damn it, Jerry,
why are we the only ones still here?

08:28.217 --> 08:30.135
I don't know.
We hated all the right things.

08:30.219 --> 08:31.553
Now there's nothing left to hate.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.889
-I'm gonna hate that rock.
-No, I'm gonna hate that rock.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.140
Let's both hate that rock.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.309
-I hate you.
-I hate you, too.

08:40.896 --> 08:41.939
Look, Stewie.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.733
Don't you think at some point
you're going to have to let Rupert go?

08:44.816 --> 08:46.735
I mean, you are getting a little old
to have a teddy bear.

08:46.818 --> 08:47.819
Brian, I'm one.

08:47.903 --> 08:48.946
-Still?
-What?

08:49.029 --> 08:51.823
Look, I'm not going to Colorado.
I'm turning around and going home.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.492
Fine, then. I'll go by myself.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.327
See you from the back of my milk carton.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.539
Want that on your conscience, Brian?
Try explaining this to Lois.

08:58.622 --> 08:59.998
You'll wind up in a dumpster

09:00.082 --> 09:02.459
with a bunch of slow,
unadoptable greyhounds.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.878
Don't joke about that.
That's like the holocaust to us.

09:04.962 --> 09:07.297
Yeah, well, when greyhounds
start running the New York Times,

09:07.381 --> 09:09.341
and the World Bank,
I'll be more inclined to believe you.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.969
-Now, are you coming or not?
-Fine.

09:15.430 --> 09:19.893
Take to the highway
Won't you lend me your name

09:19.977 --> 09:21.770
-Who sings that song?
-James Taylor.

09:21.854 --> 09:22.980
Yeah, let's keep it that way.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.399
This sucks.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.985
Can you believe I'm stuck with Meg
driving me around?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.070
Dad, it's just you and me in the car.

09:30.153 --> 09:33.323
Yeah, don't remind me.
It's bad enough I got a suspended license.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.868
I gotta ride around town
with Stinky McPoop-Pants.

09:35.951 --> 09:39.162
-I want apple juice.
-Dad, you left your apple juice at home.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.540
I want apple juice!

09:41.623 --> 09:44.626
-You wanna watch SpongeBob?
-Yes.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.378
With apple juice.

09:46.461 --> 09:51.425
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song

09:52.593 --> 09:53.927
SpongeBob.

09:54.595 --> 09:55.721
(CHUCKLING)

09:59.349 --> 10:00.684
Thanks for the ride, Bandit.

10:00.767 --> 10:06.273
Good luck tapping some of that
hot, hot Sally Field tail.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.234
Knock it off.
I don't like it any more than you do.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.361
Where the hell are we?

10:14.198 --> 10:17.910
Oh, this is history right here, Brian.
Gettysburg. Billy Yanks.

10:17.993 --> 10:22.206
The 20th Maine. So many lives lost.
All in pursuit of the ideal that

10:22.289 --> 10:25.584
no man should be subjugated
because of the color of his skin.

10:25.667 --> 10:29.922
These boys paid the ultimate price here.
For equality. For humanity.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.716
-You're welcome.
-I'm sorry?

10:32.799 --> 10:35.135
I'm just saying,
make it worth our while, you know?

10:35.219 --> 10:38.597
We wrote a pretty big check
for you folks here, so...

10:38.680 --> 10:41.892
You know, whatever. It's fine. It's fine.
Doesn't matter. Just...

10:41.975 --> 10:44.144
I just hope you're making the best
of what we gave you here.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.980
I would say that
given the events that preceded it,

10:47.064 --> 10:49.816
the couple hundred years or so,
maybe we're about even.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.485
Yeah, no, no. We gave more.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.282
Hey, Cleveland, who would you rather do?

10:57.366 --> 11:01.245
Queen Latifah or Halle Berry,
but she's been dead for six hours?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.747
Oh, man, that's a tough one.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.667
God, will you guys
just shut up back there?

11:06.750 --> 11:08.544
(ALL SNICKERING)

11:09.586 --> 11:12.005
Gross! Would you stop it? Stop it!

11:12.339 --> 11:14.299
Hey, guys, check this out.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.722
-Hey, Meg, don't be such a hothead.
-What?

11:20.806 --> 11:24.476
-Hey, Meg, you sure look hot today.
-What?

11:24.560 --> 11:27.062
Hey, Meg, I lit your scalp on fire.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.313
(SCREAMING)

11:28.397 --> 11:30.274
Don't worry, I'll put it out.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.819
(GROANING ANGRILY)

11:36.488 --> 11:39.283
What the hell is your problem,
you dumb bimbo?

11:39.575 --> 11:40.784
(GROWLING)

11:41.159 --> 11:42.828
Oh! Oh, God, stop!

11:43.203 --> 11:45.122
(SCREAMING)

11:50.002 --> 11:53.172
Meg, that was awesome.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.302
If we wanna get to Aspen,

11:58.385 --> 12:00.429
we're gonna have to get over
those mountains somehow.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.350
Excuse me, how much is it
to rent a helicopter?

12:05.434 --> 12:08.187
It's $10 an hour.
But there's a $100,000 deposit.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.314
Oh, God. Looks like we're walking.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.942
Wait a minute, it says here
you accept cash, check or a jaunty tune.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.361
Well, this rental agreement
was drafted back when

12:16.445 --> 12:18.530
musicals were culturally relevant.

12:18.614 --> 12:20.866
Unfortunately, that's no longer the case.

12:20.949 --> 12:24.119
Well, I can prove to you
that's a whole lot of nonsense.

12:25.913 --> 12:30.334
You may think that song and dance
is dated, boring and dry

12:30.417 --> 12:34.755
But you might just learn to like it
if you give it a try

12:34.838 --> 12:38.717
You could laugh and sing and dance
as gaily as an elf

12:38.800 --> 12:43.138
But just in case you don't believe me
Ask the man himself

12:43.222 --> 12:45.516
Mr. Kelly? Will you show us?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.392
-I'll show you.
-Let's do it.

12:47.476 --> 12:48.977
Good
One, two, three, four

12:49.061 --> 12:50.062
One, two, three, four

12:50.145 --> 12:52.189
-One, two, three
-One, two, three

12:52.314 --> 12:53.941
(BOTH SINGING)

12:54.024 --> 12:56.401
-You see?
-It's easy.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.663
Look at me. I'm dancing.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.889
Okay, you can have the helicopter.

14:53.060 --> 14:57.314
Brian, be careful 'cause the mountains
are the same color as the sky.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.398
-What?
-I said,

14:58.482 --> 15:01.860
"Be careful 'cause the mountains
are the same color as the..."

15:01.944 --> 15:03.570
(SCREAMING)

15:04.905 --> 15:07.908
-What the hell was that?
-I'm practicing my comedy crash.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.827
Well, keep it down 'cause I'm trying to...

15:10.911 --> 15:12.287
(BOTH SCREAMING)

15:27.928 --> 15:29.555
(LAUGHING)

15:30.889 --> 15:32.808
(BOTH SCREAMING)

15:36.103 --> 15:37.855
STEWIE: Imagine the dance
I'm gonna have to do

15:37.938 --> 15:40.148
to get our security deposit back.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.531
(PANTING)

15:48.031 --> 15:50.409
Oh, my God. Brian, look.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.786
It's Aspen. We made it.

15:52.870 --> 15:55.539
Well, it looks like you're gonna
be reunited with Rupert after all.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.625
And just in time, too.
I can't keep my teeth from chattering.

15:58.709 --> 15:59.710
(CHATTERING)

15:59.835 --> 16:00.836
Isn't that fun?

16:00.919 --> 16:03.839
I got these at Jack's Joke Shop
in South Attleboro, Massachusetts.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.717
Remember, if it ain't funny,
it ain't worth jack.

16:07.176 --> 16:08.177
Bitch.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.932
Why, you should have seen
what our amazing freaking daughter did

16:14.016 --> 16:15.976
to that guy, Lois. She kicked his ass.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.978
It was like what life did to Dana Plato.

16:18.061 --> 16:21.899
Meg, how could you do that?
You should call that man and apologize.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.484
Hey, hey, hey,
don't you talk to her like that.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.820
Meg's as cool as the other side
of the pillow.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.867
-Billy Dee Williams.
-Hello, Peter.

16:31.950 --> 16:36.496
Welcome to the cool side of the pillow.
You've had a hard day.

16:36.580 --> 16:40.876
Rest that weary head of yours
and drift on off to dreamland.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.755
Works every time.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.675
Well, this is the place.
Looks pretty fancy.

16:49.760 --> 16:50.844
(DOORBELL RINGING)

16:50.928 --> 16:54.306
-Can I help you?
-Yes, my name's Brian.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.891
Look, to make a long story short,

16:55.974 --> 16:59.311
I accidentally sold you a teddy bear
back in Rhode Island,

16:59.394 --> 17:02.356
and I kind of need it back.

17:04.149 --> 17:07.194
-Rupert! It's Rupert.
-Stanford, who is it?

17:07.277 --> 17:09.238
It's nothing, dear. I'll handle it.

17:09.321 --> 17:12.783
I'm sorry, but that bear belongs to Timmy.
Now, please leave.

17:14.743 --> 17:18.205
-Wait, wait, how about a ski-off?
-What?

17:18.288 --> 17:20.749
You heard me.
First one down the mountain wins.

17:20.832 --> 17:24.753
-If I win, I get Rupert.
-Interesting. What do I get if I win?

17:24.837 --> 17:27.506
-My dog.
-What can he do?

17:29.383 --> 17:32.970
If you put peanut butter anywhere
on your body, he'll lick it off.

17:33.846 --> 17:35.722
Anywhere.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.726
Well, I did go to Choate.
All right, it's a deal.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.336
You know, Dad, it's been really great
hanging out with you.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.298
I know there's probably a million things
you'd rather be doing.

18:09.381 --> 18:12.134
Are you kidding, Meg?
I've had more fun with you than I did

18:12.217 --> 18:15.304
going to see Lost in Translation
with Cleveland and Quagmire.

18:16.555 --> 18:20.267
-What do you think he whispered to her?
-I'll bet it was just right.

18:20.601 --> 18:24.688
Look, I know sometimes I give you
a hard time. You know, calling you names,

18:24.771 --> 18:28.358
reading your diary, farting in your cereal
when you go to get milk

18:28.442 --> 18:31.820
and then laughing,
"She doesn't know she's eating my fart".

18:31.904 --> 18:34.656
But, you know, Meg,
I'm starting to realize

18:34.740 --> 18:37.075
I got a really wonderful daughter.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.410
Thanks, Dad.

18:38.493 --> 18:42.456
Peter, good news. Your suspension is up.
You can have your license back.

18:43.123 --> 18:47.294
You mean it? I'm free?
No more getting driven around? Sweet.

18:47.878 --> 18:50.422
So, I guess this means
you don't need me anymore.

18:50.506 --> 18:53.050
You'll probably go back
to treating me like crap, huh?

18:53.133 --> 18:56.094
Well, maybe just to keep up appearances
in front of the family.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.554
You know, peer pressure and all that.

18:57.638 --> 19:01.475
But from now on, Meg,
you and me are secret best friends.

19:01.934 --> 19:04.978
-Who wants a glass of fresh lemonade?
-Not me.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.773
What I want is a fresh glass
of better daughter.

19:07.856 --> 19:08.857
(GLASS SHATTERING)

19:09.024 --> 19:10.067
Hey.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.330
Stewie, do you really think
you can beat this guy?

19:23.413 --> 19:26.333
Trust me, Brian, I've got
a few tricks up my sleeve.

19:35.676 --> 19:38.929
Oh, no, if only I had rockets in my skis.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.723
Oh, wait, I totally have rockets
in my skis.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.774
And now I just sit back,
relax and watch my progress.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.366
-Tea, sir?
-Oh, thank you, Crone.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.201
You're so pleasant.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.746
-Would you like to check on the race, sir?
-Yes, why not?

20:06.415 --> 20:08.083
(SCREAMING)

20:11.962 --> 20:13.422
(LAUGHING)

20:17.217 --> 20:19.136
Well, that's it, I suppose.

20:19.219 --> 20:23.348
Listen, I'm really sorry, Stewie.
I know how much Rupert meant to you.

20:23.432 --> 20:26.518
I don't know, Brian.
Maybe this is a sign that you were right.

20:26.602 --> 20:29.354
Maybe I am getting too old for Rupert.

20:29.938 --> 20:32.858
I guess I've just got to let him go.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.694
Wow, that's very grown-up of you, Stewie.

20:35.777 --> 20:39.907
Hey, dog, let's go.
My dad won you fair and square.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.867
You're not really gonna live with them,
are you?

20:41.950 --> 20:42.951
No.

20:43.035 --> 20:45.120
-You are not really over Rupert, are you?
-No.

20:45.204 --> 20:47.915
-That's what I thought.
-Oh, Crone.

20:49.625 --> 20:51.460
(SCREAMING)

20:52.753 --> 20:54.963
-How are we gonna get out of here?
-You still got the starting gun?

20:55.047 --> 20:56.048
-Yeah.
-Give it to me.

20:58.175 --> 21:01.386
Get out of the fucking car!
Get out of the fucking car right now, man!

21:01.470 --> 21:03.805
-Get out of the fucking car! Do it, do it!
-Oh, my God.

21:03.889 --> 21:05.265
-I'll do whatever you want!
-I'll fucking kill you!

21:05.349 --> 21:06.600
Get out of the fucking car!

21:08.185 --> 21:12.940
BRIAN: Did we just carjack someone?
STEWIE: We sure did, Brian. We sure did.
