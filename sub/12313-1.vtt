My, uh, motility and
sperm count are low.

00:08.682 --> 00:10.216
Low isn't no.

Hank, I want to apply to medical school.

00:12.652 --> 00:14.554
Jeremiah came to see me a few days ago.

00:14.588 --> 00:16.290
He was quite distraught.

00:16.323 --> 00:20.861
I'm... experiencing regression.

00:20.894 --> 00:22.363
I know.

00:22.396 --> 00:23.763
I've either dated the wrong women

00:23.797 --> 00:25.733
or screwed up the right ones.

00:25.766 --> 00:27.400
Maybe the reason I can't
find the right person

00:27.434 --> 00:28.769
is because of me.

00:28.802 --> 00:31.338
It's not you. I'm just not
doing coffee these days.

00:31.370 --> 00:34.807
I just got out of a not-so-good
relationship, so...

00:34.840 --> 00:35.808
Right.

00:35.842 --> 00:37.378

She's at the hospital, which
we need to discuss later.

came here to the Hamptons,

so much more important.

03:27.747 --> 03:28.715

What... To Ms. Newberg, right?

03:44.130 --> 03:45.532
Yeah, I popped the question last night.

- That's great.

to take your morning patient?

04:37.443 --> 04:38.778

04:39.811 --> 04:40.946
with your father before the wedding...

04:40.979 --> 04:42.549
Yeah, no, Evan's already
got that covered.

04:42.581 --> 04:43.882
Yeah, I'm throwing him a
little bachelor party

04:43.915 --> 04:45.050
here tomorrow night.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.653

04:48.220 --> 04:49.955
Trust me, I'm not worried about it.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.124
You could be a little worried about it.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.193
So it's business as usual
until then, right?

04:53.225 --> 04:55.028
Okay, so then I have
time to find a dress.

04:55.061 --> 04:56.529
Oh, you know what, don't
go overboard on wardrobe.

04:56.561 --> 04:58.497
It's just gonna be a small,
intimate ceremony on the beach

04:58.530 --> 04:59.765
with a nice little reception afterwards,

04:59.799 --> 05:01.034

finding something fancy.

05:03.035 --> 05:05.972
I am worried about finding
something that I can fit into.

05:06.004 --> 05:07.339
Oh, I actually have

05:07.373 --> 05:09.476
an old camping tent you
can borrow if you'd like.

saying things like that

Divya, I'm happy to help
you shop for something.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.387
Aren't you visiting your parents?

05:20.419 --> 05:22.521
No, I postponed my trip a couple days.

05:22.554 --> 05:26.258
I would never miss a wedding, and
definitely not this wedding.

05:28.794 --> 05:31.730
Jeremiah, it's great to have you back.

05:31.763 --> 05:33.966

05:33.999 --> 05:36.802

after your time at the lab,

05:41.706 --> 05:43.842
(CLEARS THROAT) Have you
heard from Johns Hopkins?

05:43.876 --> 05:46.479
Not yet, but I did get into Stony Brook,

05:46.511 --> 05:49.381
and, you know, it wouldn't be
so bad to stay on Long Island

05:49.415 --> 05:51.684
for medical school, especially
since it doesn't start

05:51.717 --> 05:53.052
until a month after my due date.

05:53.085 --> 05:55.121
It wouldn't bad to have
you here on Long Island,

get in, as you should.

You saw how excited he is, right?

06:29.722 --> 06:32.091
Yeah, I also saw how, when
I asked why the rush,

06:32.124 --> 06:33.426
he never explained it.

06:33.458 --> 06:36.027
Maybe because there is
no explanation, Henry.

06:36.061 --> 06:37.396
(SCOFFS) It's Dad.

investigate his motive,

be ready to give him

07:28.948 --> 07:30.883
Ah. He seems very bright.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.087
No, he's a smartass. CPU
still needs some tinkering,

07:34.119 --> 07:36.489
but the original model
is in 1 million homes.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.058
He paid for this house and a
good chunk of my campaign.

07:39.090 --> 07:40.626
Yeah, I read that profile of
you in the "Sunday Times,"

07:40.660 --> 07:42.996
how you're hoping to trade
your seat in the boardroom

07:44.027 --> 07:44.129
for a seat in the Senate.

07:44.162 --> 07:45.831
Yup, I want to reinvent
the state of New York,

07:45.864 --> 07:47.366
the way my company's
reinventing the home.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.568
Well, I assume you didn't call

07:48.600 --> 07:50.102
because you're suffering
from a lack of ambition.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.970
No, I called because I have been

07:52.003 --> 07:54.073
in around-the-clock fundraising mode

07:54.105 --> 07:55.741
since the election season began,

07:55.775 --> 07:57.911
and my left shoulder
is in a lot of pain,

07:57.943 --> 07:59.878
I think from maybe
shaking too many hands.

07:59.912 --> 08:01.948
You shake with your left hand?

08:01.980 --> 08:02.948
No, I shake with both.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.249
A woman needs a firm grip

08:04.282 --> 08:06.451
to make people believe
that she can lead.

08:06.484 --> 08:08.922
No, studies show that
anything less than 15 PSI,

08:08.955 --> 08:10.857
and swing voters won't take
a handshake seriously.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.458
Hmm, I haven't read that study.

08:12.491 --> 08:14.661
I will trade you my copy
for a cortisone shot.

08:14.693 --> 08:16.461
(CHUCKLES) Let's start
with an exam, okay?

08:16.494 --> 08:19.631
(LAUGHS) All right.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.669
So where's your campaign entourage?

08:22.701 --> 08:23.903
They will be out here tomorrow.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.738
Today I needed a break.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.273
A break from running for office?

08:27.306 --> 08:30.076
A break from staffers,
reporters, pundits.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.344
I'm still running,

08:31.377 --> 08:33.580
but from the peace and
privacy of the Hamptons,

08:33.613 --> 08:35.881
so it was the perfect
day to call a doctor.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.683
And why is that?

08:37.716 --> 08:40.919
I can't let anyone see me
dealing with a medical problem.

08:40.952 --> 08:42.922
Running for office as a
woman is hard enough

08:42.955 --> 08:44.857
without people questioning my health.

08:44.889 --> 08:45.857
Deep breath in.

08:45.891 --> 08:48.895
- (INHALES DEEPLY)

08:48.927 --> 08:49.995
Again.

08:51.027 --> 08:52.764
(INHALES DEEPLY)

08:52.797 --> 08:55.000
Okay. Any shortness of breath?

08:55.033 --> 08:56.335
Yeah, maybe a little.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.370
Although my opponent would say
that I'm full of hot air.

08:58.403 --> 09:00.405
(CHUCKLES) Well, I can't
really speak to that,

09:00.438 --> 09:02.741
but medically, I'm not too
concerned at the moment,

09:02.774 --> 09:05.510
though I'd like an MRI to rule
out a rotator cuff injury

09:05.543 --> 09:07.145
and a full cardiac workup,

09:07.178 --> 09:09.281
including a stress
test, just to be safe.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.850
If they found out that I hurt
myself just working the crowds...

09:11.883 --> 09:13.052
I assure you,

09:13.085 --> 09:16.089
Hamptons Heritage will
respect your privacy.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.928
I ordered champagne, lobsters,

09:21.960 --> 09:24.464
and the florist is doing classic
but beachy arrangements.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.766
They'll match the linens
I found perfectly.

09:26.798 --> 09:30.535
Okay, but first, I need
your expert tasting advice.

09:30.569 --> 09:32.005
Red velvet with cotton candy roses...

09:32.037 --> 09:33.005
Yes.

09:33.038 --> 09:34.072
Or vanilla maple

09:34.105 --> 09:36.241
with "love" written in
strawberry frosting.

09:36.274 --> 09:38.110
You're asking me to pick one of those?

09:38.143 --> 09:39.479
Now you see my dilemma.

09:39.512 --> 09:40.880
It's a big dilemma.
I'll help you with it.

09:40.912 --> 09:42.514
I will take this taste test ASAP.

09:42.547 --> 09:45.150
Okay, just try not to
eat the box itself.

09:45.183 --> 09:46.985
I'm really impressed by how fast

09:47.018 --> 09:49.254
you pulled all this together.

09:49.287 --> 09:50.556
Just because a wedding is last minute

09:50.589 --> 09:53.258
doesn't mean it can't be perfect.

09:53.292 --> 09:57.062
I'm also guessing it's... it's
a good distraction for you,

09:57.095 --> 09:59.231
right, like something you can focus on,

09:59.264 --> 10:02.968
something you can control.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.270
Two lattes.

10:04.302 --> 10:07.306
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

10:09.774 --> 10:10.842
$7.85, please.

10:10.875 --> 10:14.846
(BEEPS)

10:14.879 --> 10:17.984
I think this tech glitch
is getting worse.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.586
- I gotta get back down to IT.
- (KISS)

10:21.619 --> 10:23.321
Hey, since when do you drink lattes?

10:23.354 --> 10:25.858
Oh, it's not for me.
It's actually for a...

10:25.891 --> 10:28.027
VIP patient Hank just admitted.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.897
Who?

10:30.930 --> 10:32.131
(WHISPERING) Diana Underhill.

10:32.163 --> 10:33.999
- Diana Underhanded?
- Shh!

10:34.032 --> 10:35.667
The woman running against my father?

10:35.701 --> 10:37.670
We promised her we'd protect
her privacy, and yes,

10:37.702 --> 10:40.505
and you know what, she... she's
actually quite reasonable.

10:40.538 --> 10:42.841
She called my dad anti-gun.

10:42.874 --> 10:45.744
My dad, the general. The hunter.

10:45.778 --> 10:47.345
This hospital is nonpartisan, Paige.

10:47.378 --> 10:49.181
We kiss all VIP asses equally.

10:49.215 --> 10:52.384
She's a politician, Evan. Do
not be fooled by her charms.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.086
I'm-I'm... but...

10:54.119 --> 10:56.354
I'm not... I'm-I'm...

10:56.388 --> 10:58.725
(MUTTERS) No cupcakes?

10:58.758 --> 11:01.728
It feels like ten minutes
ago that I was single

11:01.760 --> 11:04.896
and motherhood was just a fantasy.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.431
(CHUCKLES)

11:06.465 --> 11:09.368
How's Raj handling it all?

11:09.401 --> 11:13.005
He's excited about having his
third child and our first.

11:13.037 --> 11:14.139
Uh-huh.

11:14.172 --> 11:15.441
He's much less stressed than I am

11:15.474 --> 11:16.776
about me starting medical school

11:16.808 --> 11:19.678
while I'll still be nursing our newborn.

11:19.711 --> 11:22.280
Life just keeps throwing us
curve balls, doesn't it?

11:22.313 --> 11:25.917
Curve balls filled with anxiety.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.754
Hank, why are you so wound up
about your father's wedding?

11:28.787 --> 11:30.590
(SIGHS)

11:30.623 --> 11:32.825
It's the old Eddie all over again,

11:32.858 --> 11:36.128
forcing me to question even
the most joyous occasion.

11:36.162 --> 11:37.596
I can't accept that it's as simple

11:37.629 --> 11:39.631
as he's making it sound, that suddenly,

11:39.664 --> 11:42.467
he has life all figured out
and is ready to settle down.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.269
Is it possible that
it's not about Eddie,

11:44.302 --> 11:46.304
that it's about you?

11:46.337 --> 11:49.441
Maybe you're measuring yourself
up against your father.

11:49.475 --> 11:53.912
Maybe I am. Him and everyone else too.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.715
Evan's married and trying to
start a family, so are you,

11:56.749 --> 11:58.651
and I couldn't be happier for you guys.

11:58.683 --> 12:00.352
- You know that.
- I do.

12:00.385 --> 12:04.624
But now, even my dad, the
reformed hustler and flake,

12:04.657 --> 12:07.259
has beaten me to the altar.

12:07.292 --> 12:08.794
It's gotta be tough to swallow.

12:08.827 --> 12:10.962
I always prided myself
in having it together,

12:10.995 --> 12:13.932
unlike him, and now he's lapping me too.

12:13.965 --> 12:16.635
You have got it plenty
together, I promise.

12:16.668 --> 12:20.038
And when the time is right,
when the person is right,

12:20.071 --> 12:21.840
you'll un-lap everyone.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.276
You mean catch up to everyone.

12:23.308 --> 12:26.545
See, you're already
one step ahead of me.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.915
Happy running. I hope it helps.

12:28.947 --> 12:31.951
Thank you. Later, Sash.

12:43.844 --> 12:46.390
Help! Someone please help my brother!

12:46.415 --> 12:48.117
- I'm a doctor. What's going on?
- Thank God.

12:48.150 --> 12:49.418
Hey, there, bud.

12:49.450 --> 12:51.820
Hey, Ian, this man's a doctor, okay?

12:51.853 --> 12:53.421
Please get it out!

12:53.454 --> 12:54.891
All right. Hang in there, Ian.

12:54.924 --> 12:57.894
I promise you'll get
your foot back in a sec.

12:57.926 --> 13:00.162
Okay.

13:00.266 --> 13:02.169
- I'm Lena. What can I do?
- All right.

13:02.202 --> 13:04.837
Lena, I need your help
to lift this bike.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.073
- Yeah?
- Okay.

13:06.106 --> 13:07.707
I was too terrified to try that.

13:07.741 --> 13:10.376
Just grab hold of it. One, two, three.

13:10.409 --> 13:13.613
- That's it, that's it. Good.
- Oh.

13:13.646 --> 13:15.581
Oh.

13:15.615 --> 13:18.351
Okay. Any of this feel tender?

13:18.385 --> 13:19.919
- A little.
- Yeah?

13:19.952 --> 13:21.922
Can you wiggle your toes?

13:21.954 --> 13:24.490
Okay, that's good.

13:24.524 --> 13:25.759
I need those paper towels.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.494
Wes.

13:29.929 --> 13:31.298
Thank you.

13:31.331 --> 13:33.166
How the hell did you get your
foot caught in there, Ian?

13:33.198 --> 13:34.767
We weren't even going that fast.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.869
You were steering like a drunk person!

13:36.903 --> 13:37.904
And you were going way too fast.

13:37.938 --> 13:39.505
I had to race to keep up with you.

13:39.539 --> 13:41.540
You rear-ended us, tailgater.

13:41.573 --> 13:42.575
Okay, enough.

13:42.608 --> 13:45.245
Just go clean the
groceries off the path.

13:46.612 --> 13:50.383
Okay, um, you guys don't
happen to have any...

13:52.552 --> 13:55.789
That's perfect.

13:55.822 --> 13:58.592
Oh, my God. We are so
lucky we ran into you.

13:58.625 --> 13:59.893
I never would have come up with that.

13:59.925 --> 14:02.628
It's a good thing you
guys came prepared.

14:02.662 --> 14:04.064
So you think he's gonna be okay?

14:04.097 --> 14:06.967
We'll need to follow up,
but he should be okay.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.869
That'll keep it comfortable.

14:08.901 --> 14:10.569
That's it.

14:10.602 --> 14:12.673
All right, let's get you up.

14:12.706 --> 14:14.274
Now, listen, Ian shouldn't put pressure

14:14.307 --> 14:15.709
or have any weight on that foot.

14:15.741 --> 14:18.077
- How you feeling, I-guy?
- Okay.

14:18.111 --> 14:20.981
Yeah, I'm s... I knew
that they were too young

14:21.014 --> 14:23.750
to be riding my parents' tandem bike.

14:23.783 --> 14:25.217
You guys need help getting home?

14:25.250 --> 14:28.154
Uh, thanks, but we don't live too far.

14:28.188 --> 14:30.256
Okay, well, I'd like to
speak to your folks anyway.

14:30.289 --> 14:32.092
Ian will need an X-ray, just to be safe.

14:32.125 --> 14:34.494
Uh, they're not around, but do you have,

14:34.526 --> 14:35.594
like, a card or something?

14:35.627 --> 14:38.631
- Um...
- Oh.

14:38.664 --> 14:39.632
There you go.

14:39.665 --> 14:41.200
Oh.

14:41.233 --> 14:43.269
All right, let's get
you up there, I-guy.

14:43.303 --> 14:45.739
(GRUNTS)

14:45.771 --> 14:47.140
I'll be sure to get this to them.

14:47.173 --> 14:49.409
Okay, please do.

14:49.442 --> 14:50.510
Thank you, Hank.

14:50.543 --> 14:51.577
Of course.

14:51.611 --> 14:52.578
Boys.

14:52.611 --> 14:53.579
BOTH: Thank you, Hank.

14:53.612 --> 14:54.914
(CHUCKLES) You got it, fellas.

14:54.948 --> 14:57.951
Ready? Keep your foot up, okay?

14:57.983 --> 14:59.986
All right, bud.

15:08.627 --> 15:10.262
He said no so many times,

15:10.295 --> 15:12.299
I thought this wedding
would never happen.

15:12.332 --> 15:14.067
Honey, it's only because I wanted to be

15:14.100 --> 15:15.135
the one that asked.

15:15.168 --> 15:17.037
Well, you certainly surprised me.

15:17.069 --> 15:19.238
The reception is gonna be so great.

15:19.271 --> 15:20.940
We'll set up a bar here,

15:20.973 --> 15:24.477
and I guess the food will go right here.

15:24.510 --> 15:26.712
And... that pretty much covers it.

15:26.746 --> 15:28.148
And I'm creating a playlist that's gonna

15:28.180 --> 15:29.648
make everyone's feet hurt.
It's gonna be awesome.

15:29.682 --> 15:33.120
Oh, thanks so much, guys,
for taking charge of this.

15:33.153 --> 15:34.755
I don't know anything
about planning a wedding

15:34.788 --> 15:35.755
for under 500.

15:35.789 --> 15:37.157
(ALL CHUCKLE)

15:37.189 --> 15:39.159
But could I look at the vendors
list, just out of curiosity?

15:39.192 --> 15:42.029
Sure, yeah, I'll go get it.

15:42.062 --> 15:43.764
- Hey, Paige.
- So?

15:43.797 --> 15:45.565
Am I late for the
reception walk-through?

15:45.597 --> 15:47.601
It just ended. We didn't
think you were coming.

15:47.634 --> 15:49.970
Uh, well, as co-best man, I
wanna be part of this wedding,

15:50.002 --> 15:51.871
every step of the way.

15:51.904 --> 15:53.273
I'm just curious, why did you guys

15:53.305 --> 15:55.107
decide to do it all in 48 hours?

15:55.140 --> 15:57.443
Look, the lecture circuit is thrilling,

15:57.476 --> 16:01.247
but then I finally realized, my
book is called "L.I.F.E."...

16:01.280 --> 16:04.818
L-I-F-E... "Life Is for Enjoying,"
and I was not enjoying myself

16:04.851 --> 16:08.188
as much as I should with the gal I love.

16:08.221 --> 16:10.057
(WHISPERING) And I'm not
getting any younger.

16:10.090 --> 16:11.992
He said I had to marry
him as soon as possible,

16:12.024 --> 16:13.760
if not sooner.

16:13.793 --> 16:17.130
What woman would slow down
a man who talks like that?

16:17.163 --> 16:18.932
Eddie's wild impulses are

16:18.965 --> 16:21.969
one of his most attractive qualities.

16:24.069 --> 16:27.006
Well, I'm glad you two
make each other so happy.

16:27.039 --> 16:29.543
Dad, you never cease to amaze me,

16:29.576 --> 16:31.510
and, Ms. Newberg, congratulations.

16:31.544 --> 16:33.914
We can't wait to officially
have you in the family.

16:33.947 --> 16:37.317
Well, I can't wait to officially be had.

16:37.350 --> 16:40.354
(LAUGHTER) Okay.

16:45.924 --> 16:48.428
Washington insiders call
it "Summer Recess."

16:48.461 --> 16:50.897
I call it a whole month wasted.

16:50.929 --> 16:53.632
I didn't build a public
company by taking August off.

16:53.665 --> 16:56.268
If elected, I won't be on recess,

16:56.302 --> 16:58.305
not when there are over
a million New Yorkers

16:58.337 --> 17:01.907
who are looking for jobs.

17:01.941 --> 17:02.976
Okay, that's it for today.

17:03.009 --> 17:04.611
Make sure that Jim gets that ASAP.

17:04.644 --> 17:05.912
Right away.

17:05.944 --> 17:08.012
And why don't we trust politicians?

17:08.047 --> 17:10.983
Mm, my impossibly young
and know-it-all staff

17:11.017 --> 17:13.720
says that I have to constantly
put fresh content up on my site

17:13.752 --> 17:16.722
so that the voters can always feel me...
I don't know.

17:16.756 --> 17:19.259
Speaking of, I have 15
fundraisers in five days,

17:19.290 --> 17:21.127
so please tell me that
you have good news.

17:21.161 --> 17:23.262
Cardiac tests and MRI were negative.

17:23.296 --> 17:25.932
If your shoulder still hurts,
it's likely an inflamed muscle.

17:25.964 --> 17:27.465
Great. What can we do about it?

17:27.500 --> 17:29.236
I'm happy to administer
that shot of cortisone.

17:29.269 --> 17:30.804
And I am happy to take you up on that.

17:30.837 --> 17:32.939
Fantastic. Come right over to my bag.

17:32.972 --> 17:34.840
I can usually block out pain,

17:34.874 --> 17:37.777
but this has just been too distracting.

17:37.809 --> 17:39.111
(GROANS)

17:39.145 --> 17:40.981
Well, it's never healthy
to live in pain.

17:41.013 --> 17:42.815
I absolutely agree.

17:42.848 --> 17:45.117
You're a concierge doctor.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.987
Can you and your cortisone injections

17:47.020 --> 17:49.889
join me on my campaign trail,
just until the pain subsides?

17:49.923 --> 17:51.290
I'll put you on staff.

17:51.324 --> 17:54.394
As much fun as all those
rubber chicken dinners sound,

17:54.426 --> 17:55.895
I have my father's wedding tomorrow.

17:55.929 --> 17:58.565
Oh, congratulations. You
must be very happy for him.

17:58.597 --> 18:00.032
Well, I'm trying to be.

18:00.066 --> 18:01.433
Hmm.

18:01.466 --> 18:05.237
Yes, family obligations and all
the drama that comes with them.

18:05.270 --> 18:07.941
It's a distraction that
I now avoid in my life.

18:07.973 --> 18:13.547
Or, if anyone asks, a
sacrifice that I made

18:13.579 --> 18:15.549
in order to better serve the people

18:15.581 --> 18:17.249
of this great state of New York.

18:17.282 --> 18:19.318
(BOTH LAUGHING)

18:20.452 --> 18:22.923
Uh...

18:22.955 --> 18:26.058
Diana, you smoke?

18:26.091 --> 18:29.361
Well, that's quite an accusation, Hank.

18:29.395 --> 18:30.529
(CHUCKLES)

18:30.562 --> 18:33.465
I made a spectacle of
publicly quitting last year,

18:33.499 --> 18:35.068
but the press conference proved to be

18:35.100 --> 18:36.902
far more impressive than my willpower,

18:36.935 --> 18:39.805
so yes, I steal a few every
day when no one is looking.

18:39.838 --> 18:42.943
I can't be seen as a
smoking flip-flopper.

18:42.975 --> 18:45.377
I can't speak to the political
ramifications of it,

18:45.411 --> 18:48.381
but I can tell you that it may
cause dangerous vascular issues,

18:48.414 --> 18:50.317
and I could've used that information

18:50.349 --> 18:51.984
during your cardiac workup.

18:52.018 --> 18:54.688
I'm not a staffer, a
constituent, or the press,

18:54.721 --> 18:57.390
so going forward, Diana,
just give it to me straight.

18:57.423 --> 19:00.426
And please, stop smoking now.

19:06.098 --> 19:08.068
The eight-year-old boy
Hank treated at the beach

19:08.100 --> 19:11.036
will be a perfect first
patient for you after...

19:11.069 --> 19:12.705
After recovering from my regression.

19:12.739 --> 19:14.708
Returning from your sabbatical.

19:14.741 --> 19:16.443
We all need one from time to time.

19:16.475 --> 19:18.444
We don't all have the same challenges

19:18.478 --> 19:20.747
navigating social interactions,
and after months in the lab,

19:20.779 --> 19:22.781
I'm a little out of practice.

19:22.815 --> 19:24.084
I'm used to mice.

19:24.116 --> 19:28.053
It was your idea to
return, now, wasn't it?

19:28.087 --> 19:30.155
All right, so why?

19:30.189 --> 19:31.157
It was necessary.

19:31.190 --> 19:32.392
I was hiding,

19:32.424 --> 19:34.760
and I thought I might be ready.

19:34.793 --> 19:37.963
And I know that you are. This
will be an easy follow-up.

19:37.997 --> 19:39.065
Remember the three steps.

19:39.097 --> 19:40.567
Introduce myself, explain myself,

19:40.599 --> 19:41.667
put the patient at ease.

20:33.385 --> 20:34.687
That is a syringe.

20:34.721 --> 20:36.756
You need to put a needle on
it to perform an injection.

20:36.789 --> 20:38.258
Don't worry, it's not for your foot.

Uh, hi. Who are you?

Hmm.

24:59.842 --> 25:02.712

of a long, flat gland

You must have.

Will I be okay?

25:09.186 --> 25:11.455
Yeah, should resolve with enough rest.

25:11.487 --> 25:12.789
So I don't have to go to the hospital?

25:12.822 --> 25:14.958
Well, luckily, I don't see
any injury to the liver,

25:14.992 --> 25:17.762
spleen, or duodenum, but
the initial ultrasound

25:17.794 --> 25:19.930
can be misleading with
these kinds of injuries,

you at some point.

This.

26:20.791 --> 26:22.726
What is that?

26:22.759 --> 26:25.762
It could be endometriosis, a
disorder in which the tissue

26:25.795 --> 26:27.097
that normally lines the uterus

26:27.130 --> 26:28.865
starts growing outside the uterus.

26:28.899 --> 26:30.967

going on in my shoulder?

26:31.001 --> 26:32.603
Well, not necessarily.

26:32.636 --> 26:33.638
If it's spread to your diaphragm,

26:33.670 --> 26:34.938
it could be irritating a nerve,

26:34.972 --> 26:37.108
making the pain radiate up to that area.

26:37.140 --> 26:39.043
Okay, well, if this
isn't life-threatening,

26:39.075 --> 26:40.944

tissue, so you can call

Okay.

29:33.216 --> 29:35.518
Okay.

And now, Diana, I have to
make an incision, okay?

29:37.821 --> 29:40.457
You're gonna feel some pressure.

Maybe I can go wash it off real quick.

30:37.747 --> 30:38.782
Yeah, don't worry about the stain.

30:38.814 --> 30:40.817
We have a bigger problem.

30:40.851 --> 30:42.352
What?

30:42.386 --> 30:45.556
Dad. He's not coming.

30:45.589 --> 30:47.191
What do you mean, he's not coming?

have doubted him after all.

convinced me that,
wedding or no wedding,

31:42.713 --> 31:44.481
there's nothing like being surrounded

31:44.514 --> 31:47.251

just not that into it,

36:35.301 --> 36:37.738
my dad canceled his last-minute wedding,

36:37.770 --> 36:41.575
and it raised some issues for me.

into big decisions

36:43.377 --> 36:46.814
without considering who will
be the collateral damage.

36:46.846 --> 36:49.883
Sam seems like such a great, happy kid,

36:49.917 --> 36:54.055
and I don't wanna cause
collateral damage.

36:54.087 --> 36:57.390
I don't wanna be my dad.

36:57.424 --> 36:58.392
Well, thank you, Hank.

36:58.424 --> 37:00.995
That's incredibly sensitive of you.

37:01.027 --> 37:03.663
But Sam's actually leaving next week

37:03.696 --> 37:06.299
to spend the summer in
Idaho with his dad,

37:06.332 --> 37:09.536
so, you know, if you wanna
call it off with me

37:09.569 --> 37:12.038
before it's even begun, then
maybe you and your legal team

37:12.071 --> 37:16.477
could come up with something
better than... inevitabilities.

37:16.509 --> 37:17.544
All set?

37:17.578 --> 37:19.581
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:26.819 --> 37:28.421
You came through yesterday's procedures

37:28.455 --> 37:30.123
like the type-A champ that you are.

37:30.156 --> 37:32.959
Your lungs are now clear of
blood and endometrial tissue.

37:32.993 --> 37:34.395
Mm.

37:34.428 --> 37:38.031
I hadn't really noticed how
compromised my lungs were.

37:38.064 --> 37:40.166
Feel like I have brand-new
lungs now, thank you.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.768
Yeah, well, stay away
from the cigarettes,

37:41.801 --> 37:43.536
and they'll start to feel even better.

37:43.569 --> 37:46.039
So can I go home now, please?

37:46.073 --> 37:48.609
You'll need a laparoscopy
to clear the endometriosis

37:48.642 --> 37:50.243
from your diaphragm and pelvis.

37:50.276 --> 37:52.279

That's... yay.

37:53.346 --> 37:54.748
(BOTH LAUGHING)

37:54.781 --> 37:55.950

37:55.982 --> 37:57.751
a minimally invasive laser, but...

37:57.785 --> 37:58.953
Okay.

37:58.986 --> 38:01.721
Depending on what they
find during the procedure,

38:01.754 --> 38:03.123
Diana, I'm sorry to tell you,

38:03.156 --> 38:05.992
you may have to consider a hysterectomy

38:06.026 --> 38:09.297
to prevent the problem from recurring.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.433
What's the recovery time?

38:12.466 --> 38:14.000
Depending on the type of hysterectomy,

38:14.033 --> 38:15.602
you could be back at work in a few days,

38:15.636 --> 38:17.238
as long as you don't
do any heavy lifting.

38:17.270 --> 38:19.839
Well, if I'm stuck here
for more than a few days,

38:19.872 --> 38:21.207
the only thing that'll
need heavy lifting

38:21.241 --> 38:24.344
will be my polling
numbers, so thank you.

38:24.377 --> 38:26.747
Um...

38:26.779 --> 38:30.051
can I... can I get it all done at once?

38:30.084 --> 38:32.520
You mean do the
hysterectomy on the spot?

38:32.553 --> 38:33.921
Mm-hmm.

38:33.953 --> 38:37.024
Well, there are factors to consider,

38:37.056 --> 38:40.328
but you could discuss them
either with me or an ob-gyn,

38:40.361 --> 38:43.163
or I could have the social
worker on staff come down...

38:43.196 --> 38:45.865
I considered all those
factors long ago, Hank,

38:45.899 --> 38:48.835
and I've made my choice.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.137
I think... I think just wanna

38:51.171 --> 38:53.873
get it over with and get back to work.

38:53.906 --> 38:56.209
I have a senate seat to win.

38:56.243 --> 38:58.479
That's the future of my dreams.

39:00.346 --> 39:02.549
Okay.

39:02.582 --> 39:04.584
I reassured Diana you'd
protect her privacy.

39:04.618 --> 39:06.286
Yeah, and I have been, since
the second you admitted her.

39:06.319 --> 39:08.154
She's really worried
about political enemies.

39:08.187 --> 39:12.292
Well, she's a really polarizing figure.

39:12.326 --> 39:14.128
Especially in my house.

Oh, that's all right. We'll just...

39:28.741 --> 39:31.111
we'll just sit over here
and just be patient.

39:31.145 --> 39:32.546
I could have him paged if it's urgent.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.748
No, that's all right. No,
we don't mind waiting.

39:34.781 --> 39:36.316
Right, honey?

39:36.350 --> 39:39.354
Who doesn't love to wait?

39:42.556 --> 39:45.192
Hank hasn't heard from him either?

39:45.225 --> 39:46.927
Are you gonna reach out?

39:46.960 --> 39:50.431
No, not this time. The
ball is in Eddie's court.

39:50.464 --> 39:52.166
Babe, I'm happy to postpone again.

39:52.198 --> 39:54.467
No. No, go to Houston.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.102
Give your parents a big hug for me,

39:56.136 --> 39:59.140

Okay?

40:04.511 --> 40:07.214

Mr. Lawson, can I have a word?

40:40.881 --> 40:43.518
Yeah, of course.

40:45.118 --> 40:46.921
Okay, great.

40:46.953 --> 40:51.691
Jeremiah, those patients over
there are waiting for you.

40:51.725 --> 40:53.761
Those aren't patients.
Those are my parents.

40:53.794 --> 40:56.797
I don't know why they're here,
but I'll ask them to leave.

41:02.636 --> 41:04.338
Okay, thank you.

41:06.707 --> 41:09.910
Hey, what's going on?
Did you hear from Dad?

41:09.942 --> 41:11.511
No, I heard from IT.

41:11.544 --> 41:13.646
You know that glitch? It's
not a technical problem.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.448
So then what's the issue?

41:15.482 --> 41:18.352
It's an attack, like, a big one.

41:18.384 --> 41:20.520
- So you're saying...
- We've been hacked.
