WEBVTT

00:02.828 --> 00:03.873
Lady Luck
is on your side
fromLA to Vegas.

00:03.916 --> 00:07.181
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?Don't cockpit-block me.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.443
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.271
And check out our other Fox programs,

00:10.314 --> 00:12.055
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:12.099 --> 00:13.317
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.753
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.797 --> 00:15.972
Only on Fox.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.111
All right,
let the heathens board.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.113
Maybe you should check
that compartment first.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.728
Happy birthday...

00:32.771 --> 00:34.556
You know I can't eat
your supermarket trash.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.123
I need to keep it tight
for my party tonight.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.081
This is a milestone birthday
for me.

00:38.125 --> 00:41.737
Right, because you're
turning thi... or... xty.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.695
People much smarter than you
have tried to figure out

00:43.739 --> 00:46.176
how old I am,
and they have all failed.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.656
Relax. Your parties are
always incredible.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.092
They get better and better
every year.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.181
You think that's by accident?
It takes work.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.791
You just don't throw together
an avant-garde

00:52.835 --> 00:55.359
Bible-themed "Fashion
of the Christ" costume party.

00:55.403 --> 00:57.144
Speaking of which,
what's the costume?

00:57.187 --> 01:00.234
Well, I was thinking of being
a sexy Rachel from Laban,

01:00.277 --> 01:03.237
Genesis 29:16.
It's a deep cut.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.326
No deep cuts!
Stick to the hits.

01:05.369 --> 01:07.110
Hey there, team.
Enough chitchat, Bernie,

01:07.154 --> 01:08.590
let's get to work--
two choices.

01:08.633 --> 01:11.810
I've got sexy Nebuchadnezzar,
or sexy Goliath.

01:11.854 --> 01:14.248
I'm leaning towards Goliath
because it shows off my thighs,

01:14.291 --> 01:16.250
and they're my
second-best feature.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.687
Meaty but lean,
like a fine turkey chili.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.385
-Goliath will be fine.
-Yes!

01:23.518 --> 01:25.824
There was no trash
in there.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.348
It was a clean bag.

01:29.219 --> 01:30.351
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.135
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:32.179 --> 01:35.138
â™ª

01:40.187 --> 01:42.711
Marcia Gimble is arguing
that the commons

01:42.754 --> 01:44.756
doesn't need
a car-charging station.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.194
Honey, sit up straight.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.935
-Good afternoon.
-Hi. I'm Nichole.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.286
We've never met before.
I'm on my way to Las Vegas

01:52.329 --> 01:54.505
for the very first time
because my mother

01:54.549 --> 01:57.378
surprised me with backstage
passes to Celine Dion.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.423
She's very well-connected
because she's the deputy mayor

01:59.467 --> 02:01.991
of Calabasas, and frowns upon
almost everything.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.384
It's nice to meet you.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.516
You as well.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.431
She was the normal one.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.737
DAVE :
Are you tired

02:08.780 --> 02:11.087
of the same old
restaurant experience?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.785
Then do what I do
and head down to Broth,

02:13.829 --> 02:17.180
Vegas' finest new eatery,
where everything's soup,

02:17.224 --> 02:20.401
including you,
because the dining room's

02:20.444 --> 02:22.751
a Jacuzzi.

02:22.794 --> 02:26.058
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Is Bernard all right?

02:26.102 --> 02:27.408
I just wished him
a happy birthday,

02:27.451 --> 02:29.105
and he said,
"Why can't people just say

02:29.149 --> 02:30.672
'Merry Christmas' anymore?"

02:30.715 --> 02:33.196
Yeah, he's distracted today.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.198
He's just a little wound up
about his party.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.460
Bernard can get wound?

02:36.504 --> 02:38.549
Ah, I've only ever seen him
be like...

02:38.593 --> 02:40.116
You know what, that's probably
not an impression

02:40.160 --> 02:41.248
I should be trying.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.336
He just gets so worked up

02:42.379 --> 02:44.425
trying to top himself
every year.

02:44.468 --> 02:47.297
Honestly, he probably shouldn't
even be working today.

02:47.341 --> 02:50.431
Oh, excuse me, I'm
a very nervous flier.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.346
Congratulations.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.477
So, you're coming
tonight, right?

02:53.521 --> 02:54.870
No, no, I'm still
going through

02:54.913 --> 02:56.350
this divorce nonsense.

02:56.393 --> 02:57.568
Meghan is determined make
the whole thing

02:57.612 --> 02:59.135
as ugly as possible.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.658
I mean, I married
a magician's assistant,

03:00.702 --> 03:02.573
and now she's making all
my possessions disappear.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.053
Well, that's exactly why
you should come.

03:04.096 --> 03:05.402
It'll take your mind
off of it.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.012
We'll drink,
we'll take pictures.

03:07.056 --> 03:09.014
I will help you pretend
you're happy.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.234
The best revenge is
an act of social media.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.584
Right now, I am just using it
to follow majestic boats

03:13.628 --> 03:15.891
and this adorable Corgi.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.893
Oh, my God, he died?

03:17.936 --> 03:19.590
Piper.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.505
So, party then?

03:21.549 --> 03:24.900
Yes. It's what Piper
would have wanted.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.945
He loved parties.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.168
So, how are classes going
this semester?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.343
They're good.
Actually, I have a friend

03:33.387 --> 03:34.866
who got me interested in econ.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.085
-so I'm thinking about...

03:36.128 --> 03:37.695
Oh, sorry.
Hold that thought.

03:37.739 --> 03:41.525
Gotta go use the little
deputy mayor's room.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.484
So, let me guess.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.486
Your mother surprised you
with the trip,

03:45.529 --> 03:47.139
but she doesn't know
you're a stripper,

03:47.183 --> 03:48.445
always take this flight.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.708
What a big pickle
you have become.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.407
-Well, I have seven senses.

03:53.450 --> 03:56.192
I can detect lies
and ghosts.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.498
I want to tell my mom
the truth,

03:57.541 --> 03:58.934
but she just wouldn't
understand.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.283
She's an old-school feminist.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.198
I wasn't allowed
to wear dresses growing up

04:02.242 --> 04:04.331
because, quote,
"Mary Tyler Moore fought hard

04:04.374 --> 04:06.289
for our right to wear pants,
and we have to honor that."

04:06.333 --> 04:07.638
I understand your hesitance.

04:07.682 --> 04:10.075
Now, if there's anything
I can do

04:10.119 --> 04:13.514
to make your first visit
to Las Vegas

04:13.557 --> 04:15.951
more enjoyable,
just let me know.

04:15.994 --> 04:17.344
Hello, I'm her mother.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.693
Oh, I thought you were
younger sister.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.349
Cute. We're good. Thank you.

04:22.392 --> 04:25.221
I tell you, Alan, I cannot wait
for Bernard's party.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.224
This is the tush event
of the season.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.008
Ooh, think you'll do
another late night

04:30.052 --> 04:31.662
pawn shop
engagement

04:31.706 --> 04:33.708
No, I'm out of the
relationship game for good.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.318
I already have
my one true love,

04:35.362 --> 04:36.754
and that's the sky.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.322
That's right, this bee ain't
looking for a queen.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.585
Tonight, he's all about
the honey.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.674
T... The party's tonight?

04:43.718 --> 04:45.763
But it's my bowling
championship.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.549
You promised that if I advanced,
you would come.

04:48.592 --> 04:52.379
Well, you advanced...
and hopefully I will.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.771
No, I'm not gonna report it.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.034
I'm just saying
it was a gross joke.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.559
I'm sorry, Alan.

04:58.602 --> 05:01.388
Excuse me, I need to speak
to somebody about this flight.

05:01.431 --> 05:02.998
Hi. Captain Dave.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.043
Go ahead and mainline
that praise right to me.

05:05.087 --> 05:08.786
Oh, the praise,for the lack
of storage space,

05:08.830 --> 05:10.222
or the uncomfortable seats,

05:10.266 --> 05:12.137
or the white

05:12.181 --> 05:14.836
I mean, the autopilot could have
done a batter job.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.577
Maybe, but let's see
the autopilot

05:16.620 --> 05:18.796
take break dancing classes
at the "Y."

05:18.840 --> 05:20.276
This is a terrible airline.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.147
I'll have you know that
Jackpot is ranked number one

05:22.191 --> 05:23.410
in completed customer surveys.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.586
We're first-class
all the way.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.588
Just ask Nichole.

05:27.631 --> 05:28.980
How do you know Nichole?

05:29.024 --> 05:30.765
-She's one of my regulars.
-One of your...

05:30.808 --> 05:33.071
What is he talking about?

05:33.115 --> 05:34.943
Um...

05:34.986 --> 05:37.249
Okay, Mom,

05:37.293 --> 05:38.990
I haven't been totally
honest with you.

05:39.034 --> 05:42.037
The truth is,

05:42.080 --> 05:45.083
Captain Dave
knows me because...

05:48.130 --> 05:50.306
...he's my boyfriend.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.964
If I look surprised,
it's because I didn't think

05:56.007 --> 05:57.444
we were using labels yet.

06:02.144 --> 06:05.060
-Yep.

06:05.103 --> 06:06.540
It's only been
a few weeks.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.064
We were nervous to tell you,
for obvious reasons

06:09.107 --> 06:10.413
-because he's so, so old.
-It's still very early.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.241
Very early.

06:12.284 --> 06:15.200
It's just, I'm...
It's so unexpected.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.202
I just don't--
I don't know what to say.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.291
Well, why don't you think about
it while you get your bag?

06:21.859 --> 06:23.426
I don't like to be squeezed.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.080
Look, she doesn't know
I'm a stripper.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.864
Jut pretend to be my boyfriend
for five minutes.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.344
It'll be the fastest
relationship of your life.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.650
No, it won't.

06:29.693 --> 06:32.000
Hey, Mom, well, I'm glad
you two got to meet.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.089
-We should probably get going.
-Oh, no, hold on a second.

06:34.132 --> 06:36.570
I just met your boyfriend, I'd
like to get to know him better.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.006
Would you like to join us
for dinner, Dave?

06:38.049 --> 06:40.225
Oh, he can't, he has
a coworker's birthday party.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.488
Oh, sounds fun.
We'll tag along.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.707
It's a Bible thing--
we'd have to have a costume.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.143
Nichole, I'm your mother.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.667
If I want to get to know
your boyfriend better

06:46.710 --> 06:47.929
and dress up like
Jesus of Nazareth,

06:47.972 --> 06:49.800
that's what we're doing.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.455
Your mother is terrifying.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.718
Yeah. Well, you don't get
to the top of the middle

06:54.762 --> 06:57.112
-of local politics without
busting a few balls. -Mm.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.855
[indistinct chatter,
music playing]

07:06.556 --> 07:08.471
Wow.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.734
For my birthday, I usually
just get a hotel room

07:10.778 --> 07:12.693
so I can read
in a different bed.

07:12.736 --> 07:17.175
Hey, Bernard,
this party's incredible.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.568
Halt!

07:18.612 --> 07:19.613
Don't mock me.

07:19.656 --> 07:20.831
If it were truly incredible,

07:20.875 --> 07:22.398
you would be speechless.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.401
This party is still
severely lacking. Just look.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.881
The magician is turning
the water into merlot

07:26.924 --> 07:28.317
instead of rosÃ©.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.666
We need one more big spectacle

07:29.710 --> 07:31.102
to put this birthday
over the top.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.408
And I'm going to find it.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.540
Storm me off.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.281
I said storm!

07:36.325 --> 07:38.849
I'm not sure how I feel
about Birthday Bernard.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.764
ARTEM:
Hey, look.

07:40.808 --> 07:43.071
Ronnie came dressed like Mary.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.725
Joseph and Mary, right?

07:44.768 --> 07:46.553
You were meant to be.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.685
I think that Ronnie-Colin ship
has sailed.

07:48.729 --> 07:50.600
I have good news:
the Earth is round,

07:50.644 --> 07:53.342
so a sailed ship is coming back.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.562
She asked you to come.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.433
That is good sign.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.869
Okay, okay, I'll go say hi.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.392
Although, I'm not gonna lie,
half the reason

08:00.436 --> 08:01.872
is to end this conversation.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.005
-Yeah, it has run its course.
-Have fun, friend.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.877
Hey, the Virgin Mary?

08:06.921 --> 08:08.792
-It's me, Joseph.
-Hey, that's crazy.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.185
Well, it was the simplest
of the costumes

08:10.228 --> 08:12.187
on Bernard's preapproved list.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.971
Oh, yeah,
that's why Bryan chose it, too.

08:14.015 --> 08:16.147
-Hey, babe.
-Hey. You remember Bryan.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.367
'Cause I feel like we've met

08:18.410 --> 08:22.110
a bunch of times before;
the plane, the restaurant.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.677
Well, I go
on a lot of planes, Ryan.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.939
It's Bryan.

08:24.982 --> 08:27.681
Ah. It's a beautiful name.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.818
So I was looking
to hook up tonight.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.820
How does our fake dating
affect my chances?

08:36.864 --> 08:38.039
Negatively.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.823
Damn it. You owe me for this.

08:39.867 --> 08:40.955
Not sexually.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.044
Just... get me a gift card.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.654
Okay.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.700
-Oh, hi, Mom.
-Hi, honey.

08:46.743 --> 08:50.007
So, Patricia, or should
I call you Madam Deputy Mayor?

08:50.051 --> 08:51.922
-Patricia is fine.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.794
I'm not just a politician.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.839
I'm also co-owner of Calabasics,

08:55.883 --> 08:57.841
Southern California's
number one retailer

08:57.885 --> 08:59.974
of tasteful ponchos
for women who work.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.192
I love that store.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.716
Those ponchos are not
just for women who work,

09:02.759 --> 09:05.283
-they're also for men
who want to be comfortable. -Mm.

09:05.327 --> 09:08.069
So, Dave, tell me, what made you
decide to become a pilot?

09:08.112 --> 09:10.071
Well, Patricia, it all started
when I first read

09:10.114 --> 09:11.986
the story of Icarus,

09:12.029 --> 09:14.989
who flew so close to the sun
with no repercussions.

09:15.032 --> 09:17.252
Okay, Bernard,
what are you doing with that?

09:17.295 --> 09:18.645
Damage control.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.037
Not one person has yet said,

09:20.081 --> 09:21.822
"Bernard,
you've outdone yourself."

09:21.865 --> 09:23.693
Not my brunch club,
not my champagne club.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.652
Not even anyone from my gossip
and cheese group,

09:25.695 --> 09:27.392
The Crass Fromagerie.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.394
What I need
is a big biblical set piece,

09:29.438 --> 09:32.267
which is why I'm setting up
a burning bush s'mores station.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.269
S'mores seems
a little off theme.

09:34.312 --> 09:36.619
I'm sorry.
Who the hell invited her?

09:38.012 --> 09:39.883
Ooh, the foot-washing station
is open.

09:39.927 --> 09:42.233
Bryan, do you want to go get
your feet washed in public?

09:42.277 --> 09:43.452
No, I'm good.

09:43.495 --> 09:44.845
Okay, your loss.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.412
So...

09:47.456 --> 09:48.762
So you're a chef.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.459
Um, how did you get into that?

09:50.502 --> 09:52.809
It started in the Marines.
I'd cook for my unit sometimes.

09:52.853 --> 09:53.984
-Yeah.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.072
Like Rob Riggle?

09:55.116 --> 09:56.813
Yeah. I joined after college.

09:56.857 --> 09:59.903
Uh, I had a professor
who changed my life.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.819
No way. A professor had
a profound effect on you?

10:02.863 --> 10:04.473
-Yeah.
-Huh.

10:04.516 --> 10:06.562
He sat me down one day,
and he said,

10:06.606 --> 10:08.738
-"Whatever you do...
-Hmm.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.132
"...do not be a professor.

10:11.175 --> 10:15.092
Do something
that actually matters."

10:15.136 --> 10:16.528
So, what do you do?

10:16.572 --> 10:18.705
-I'm a professor.
-Professor.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.797
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.886
What

10:25.929 --> 10:28.279
I was thinking about it,
Dave, yes.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.716
Look, if there's anything
I've learned from being trapped

10:29.759 --> 10:31.500
in a long-term
fictional relationship

10:31.543 --> 10:33.328
over the past
two and a half hours,

10:33.371 --> 10:35.939
is that you got to enjoy
your freedom while it lasts.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.811
Dude, look around,
there are chicks everywhere,

10:37.854 --> 10:39.813
and, like,
five other straight dudes.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.337
I don't know if it's the helmet,

10:42.380 --> 10:44.687
but you're kind of
making sense to me.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.950
There are several Eves
looking for their Adam.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.473
It's too bad Alan's not here.

10:48.517 --> 10:49.692
He's a great wingman.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.302
-I'm here! And I won.
-Uh...

10:51.346 --> 10:52.477
He is here.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.565
Let's go bag some strange.

10:53.609 --> 10:54.958
Stand back.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.874
I'm going to go enjoy myself.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.615
Hello, Dave.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.617
I thought we could have a word.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.836
Without Nichole.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.968
Ah. I knew this was coming.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.709
Patricia, I know,
as a politician,

11:06.753 --> 11:09.712
a pilot's endorsement
is very valuable...

11:09.756 --> 11:12.193
I want to be really clear
about something.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.935
My daughter is not
just some plaything, okay?

11:14.978 --> 11:16.501
I know what you are.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.808
You've been divorced,
what, three times?

11:18.852 --> 11:21.768
You're lonely, you're not
man enough to admit it,

11:21.811 --> 11:23.944
so you hide behind
these empty declarations

11:23.987 --> 11:26.598
like "The sky is my mistress,"
and similar nonsense,

11:26.642 --> 11:29.079
and you seek out relationships

11:29.123 --> 11:31.125
with women 30 years younger
who can't hurt you

11:31.168 --> 11:32.909
as much as you've been
hurt before.

11:32.953 --> 11:36.783
So I see what you're doing,
and I don't like it.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.662
â™ª

11:46.706 --> 11:47.924
Hey, do you want to borrow this?

11:47.968 --> 11:49.534
-It's a total chick magnet.
-Uh,

11:49.578 --> 11:51.406
that actually won't
be necessary, Alan.

11:51.449 --> 11:52.886
I'm a Brit in America.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.626
All I have to do
is up the accent,

11:54.670 --> 11:56.324
do a bit of Hugh Grant
phumphering...

11:56.367 --> 11:57.978
:
and, uh, everything, um,

11:58.021 --> 12:01.024
rather falls into place.

12:01.068 --> 12:05.028
Um, u-uh, hello, old chap,
a pint of, uh,

12:05.072 --> 12:06.247
whatever you're pouring.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.988
And I'll have one of those, too.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.990
Pardon me for saying so,
but it's as if I'm looking

12:10.033 --> 12:13.863
at an angel, uh, in, uh,
is it, what, devil's clothing?

12:13.907 --> 12:16.474
You sound like Love Actually.

12:16.518 --> 12:17.780
-Ah.
-I'm Rose.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.914
And that, Alan,
is how you... oh.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.959
Oh, dear God. Oh.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.918
Hey. Where'd Colin go?

12:24.961 --> 12:26.833
He's over there,
talking to the Devil.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.878
RONNIE:
Who is she?

12:28.922 --> 12:30.967
I think she's actually
the magician's assistant.

12:31.011 --> 12:33.491
He's flirting
with a magician's assistant?

12:33.535 --> 12:34.666
Uh, seriously?

12:34.710 --> 12:35.929
I finally figured out

12:35.972 --> 12:37.669
how to take this party
to the next level.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.584
I'm going to walk on water.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.630
Ronnie, I just need you
to come out to the pool,

12:41.673 --> 12:44.372
squeeze me into my harness
and set up my wires and pulleys.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.374
Yeah, okay, uh,
can you help him with that?

12:46.417 --> 12:47.941
I don't think anyone can.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.681
Thanks. I just, I ha--
I have to talk to Colin

12:49.725 --> 12:51.466
before he does something
he'll regret. I...

12:51.509 --> 12:54.904
Have you ever operated a lift
line in a theatrical production?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.688
No, so I probably shouldn't.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.690
Your hair is one strike.
Don't make it two.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.215
And then I was like,
"Is it really credit card fraud

13:01.258 --> 13:02.433
if it's your sister?"

13:02.477 --> 13:04.261
-No. No. No.
-No.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.089
Oh.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.090
I'll be right back.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.962
I've got to do one quick thing.

13:12.748 --> 13:13.836
Hey.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.838
Hi.
-Hi. Uh, I just thought

13:15.882 --> 13:19.886
I'd come over and stop you
from making a huge mistake.

13:19.929 --> 13:20.930
Uh, what are you talking about?

13:20.974 --> 13:22.497
Talking about that girl.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.412
-Colin, she's exactly
like your ex

13:24.455 --> 13:26.893
That whole look and that vibe

13:26.936 --> 13:29.112
and that, like, that wide-eyed
head tilt thing that she does.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.331
:
I mean,

13:30.374 --> 13:31.636
I mean, for God's sake,

13:31.680 --> 13:33.334
she's even
a magician's assistant.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.295
Okay. Did not know that.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.732
But, so what? I have a type.

13:40.776 --> 13:43.474
And all I'm doing is having
some fun and some drinks.

13:43.518 --> 13:44.649
Okay. Yeah, well, the last time

13:44.693 --> 13:45.868
you got drunk
with a woman like that,

13:45.912 --> 13:47.087
it led to a nasty divorce

13:47.130 --> 13:49.219
and you following dead dogs
on Instagram.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.655
Oh, Piper.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.744
I'd forgotten about that.
Thanks a lot, Ronnie.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.268
Sorry, I'm just trying
to look out for you.

13:54.311 --> 13:55.356
I don't need your help.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.879
Honestly, I can make
my own decisions.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.926
So why don't you go back
to the Joseph you rode in on?

14:02.711 --> 14:04.800
Ugh! I can't believe
you messed that up.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.584
Really? Because I was
nonstop screaming

14:06.628 --> 14:08.935
"I don't know what I'm doing."

14:12.199 --> 14:13.722
Your mom just came up to me
and broke me down

14:13.765 --> 14:15.724
like a cardboard box
on trash day.

14:15.767 --> 14:16.943
I'm so sorry.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.031
She can be intense.

14:18.074 --> 14:20.598
No, I'm hard into it.
She gets me.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.774
I'd like to take her
to a steak dinner.

14:22.818 --> 14:23.906
Is that all right with you?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.038
Are you serious?

14:25.081 --> 14:26.909
No. No, that's not all right.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.345
Oh, come on. Please.

14:28.389 --> 14:31.000
Your mom is strong,
smart and sexy.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.784
And not just physically,
but emotionally.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.308
And also physically.

14:34.351 --> 14:35.831
She got the body
of a stripper's mom.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.528
Why can't you just tell her
who you really are?

14:37.572 --> 14:38.965
I wish we had
the kind of relationship

14:39.008 --> 14:41.750
where I could tell her
the truth, but we just don't.

14:41.793 --> 14:42.925
But I have to be honest,

14:42.969 --> 14:44.144
I think I'm in love with her.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.189
Oh, my God. You fall in love
with every woman you meet.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.974
Not you. You're really annoying.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.327
Can you believe Colin?
I mean, what is he doing?

14:53.370 --> 14:55.198
Ronnie, I have my own crisis.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.547
I don't have time to deal
with your jealousy.

14:56.591 --> 14:59.333
I'm...
Oh, no, I'm not... jealous?

14:59.376 --> 15:00.551
No, that's ridiculous.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.511
I have my own boyfriend
who's here... somewhere.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.166
Good, because I don't remember
Mary having two Josephs.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.341
Although that is a Bible
I'd read.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.212
Oh, my God, you're right.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.736
What am I doing?
I should be focusing on Bryan,

15:11.780 --> 15:13.216
-not worrying about...
-Shh.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.392
Okay. Can you read my order
back to me?

15:15.436 --> 15:18.352
No, not one. It's two llamas,
two giraffes.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.136
Do you not know
how to fill an ark?

15:20.180 --> 15:21.572
Put your supervisor
on the phone.

15:21.616 --> 15:24.314
Oh, Go... I am gonna tell you
what you told me

15:24.358 --> 15:26.795
when I tried singing Dreamgirls
in the shower:

15:26.838 --> 15:28.928
you have to stop.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.844
Ah, hey.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.846
Oh, so you are
Ronald's boyfriend.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.023
And let me guess, Artem?

15:37.066 --> 15:39.373
No. Baby Jesus.

15:39.416 --> 15:40.809
Just kidding.

15:40.852 --> 15:43.681
Now I'm Artem.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.814
Yeah, Ronnie told me
all about you guys.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.120
You, Bernard.

15:47.163 --> 15:50.210
Only one she hasn't
really talked about is Colin.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.255
Is there history there?

15:52.299 --> 15:55.084
Oh, yeah. I have much history
with Colin.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.172
No, no, I meant Ronnie.

15:56.216 --> 15:59.001
Well, I have more history
with Ronnie.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.047
I'm sorry.
I meant Colin and Ronnie.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.049
Yes. I know both of them.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.094
-All right.
-Yeah.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.836
-This feels like I got the full
Artem experience. -Yeah.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.794
COLIN:
Hey, hey, Dave.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.883
My, uh, my lady asked me
to take her home.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.146
So, thanks for the pep talk.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.886
That was the old Dave.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.888
The new Dave sees
the emptiness of cheap sex

16:16.932 --> 16:18.064
and meaningless flings.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.109
-You know, Colin...
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.155
I was just really swinging by
for a high five,

16:22.198 --> 16:24.679
but we'll discuss whatever
this is on Sunday.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.942
I want to.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.163
Hey, boo.
We just finished

16:30.206 --> 16:32.034
our New Testa-Mint Chip
ice cream sundae,

16:32.078 --> 16:33.470
so I'm gonna take Mom home.

16:33.514 --> 16:34.732
PATRICIA:
Good-bye, Dave.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.734
Nice to meet you.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.174
Look, I...

16:41.217 --> 16:42.871
I was out of line before.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.960
I mean, as a single woman,
it's just hard to see

16:45.004 --> 16:47.049
a handsome man my age
dating a woman

16:47.093 --> 16:48.398
young enough to be his daughter.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.966
Who, in this case,
is my daughter.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.708
But it was wrong of me to take
my frustrations out on you,

16:53.751 --> 16:55.449
and I'm sorry.

16:55.492 --> 16:58.191
Wait. Don't be sorry.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.236
You were right about everything.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.672
I'm vapid. I'm scared.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.196
I'm a shell of a man
inside an empty uniform

17:03.239 --> 17:07.113
who came here tonight
for one reason only: tush.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.289
But you made me realize
that's just a distraction.

17:09.332 --> 17:10.290
I need a connection.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.945
And it's you.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.991
Would you like to have a steak
and share a wedge salad with me?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.471
Dave!

17:17.514 --> 17:20.213
You're in a relationship
with my daughter.

17:20.256 --> 17:22.911
That's the good news. I've been
lying to you. Nichole, tell her.

17:24.130 --> 17:27.089
Oh, hey. What are you doing?

17:27.133 --> 17:28.569
Well, the magician asked me
to hold it for him

17:28.612 --> 17:30.092
and now no one
will take it from me.

17:30.136 --> 17:33.269
Oh. Gross.
Anyway, uh,

17:33.313 --> 17:35.097
I'm sorry that I disappeared,

17:35.141 --> 17:37.665
but now I am back
and for the rest of the night,

17:37.708 --> 17:39.275
you have my full at...

17:39.319 --> 17:41.190
Are they leaving together?

17:42.757 --> 17:46.630
Uh, I'm sorry,
I-I have to go stop this.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.332
Nichole Hayes,
I want the truth right now.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.247
Okay, Mom.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.814
The truth is
I'm not dating Dave.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.251
He was just covering for me.

17:58.294 --> 18:03.343
The real reason I know everyone
on that flight is...

18:04.518 --> 18:05.780
...I'm dating Ronnie.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.216
Who's Ronnie?

18:07.260 --> 18:08.391
Hi.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.132
Wait, you're dating?

18:13.222 --> 18:15.833
-Uh-huh.

18:15.877 --> 18:19.272
Yeah. Big time.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.838
:
We...

18:20.882 --> 18:24.277
Yeah, I... we-we are.

18:24.320 --> 18:28.194
So, just so glad that
it's out in the open now.

18:28.237 --> 18:31.284
We-we were nervous about telling
you for obvious reasons.

18:31.327 --> 18:34.374
-Because she's so, so old.
-Because we're gay.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.419
DAVE:
Just to be clear,

18:36.463 --> 18:38.291
I'm not gay.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.166
â™ª

18:44.210 --> 18:45.211
Oh, honey. I always felt like

18:45.254 --> 18:46.951
you were keeping something
from me.

18:46.995 --> 18:50.172
And I'm-I'm just so sorry
that I made you feel

18:50.216 --> 18:52.392
like you couldn't tell me
that you were gay.

18:52.435 --> 18:56.396
No, I'm sorry that I put a rift
between us by not telling you.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.093
Well, you don't have
to keep that a secret.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.444
I'm just so glad to be honest
with you, Mom.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.880
I love you.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.274
Oh.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.885
Geez, I thought my relationship
with my mom was messed up.

19:07.929 --> 19:10.236
-God, one time she asked me...
-Shh.

19:10.279 --> 19:13.674
This is a beautiful moment
for me and my future new family.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.807
Hey, Bernard.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.462
What are you doing?

19:19.506 --> 19:21.899
I don't even know.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.336
I'm trying so hard
to wow everybody,

19:23.379 --> 19:24.598
and I can't do it anymore.

19:24.641 --> 19:25.903
But what choice do I have?

19:25.947 --> 19:28.906
If these parties don't
get bigger every year,

19:28.950 --> 19:33.346
that means I've already reached
peak Bernard.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.217
It's all downhill from here.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.567
Listen. I think
you're trying too hard

19:37.611 --> 19:40.440
to please everybody,
including yourself.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.834
Why not celebrate your birthday
with just the people

19:43.878 --> 19:47.229
who make you feel good
about being Bernard?

19:47.273 --> 19:50.319
And who would those losers be?

19:51.494 --> 19:54.367
Thank you to my friends
and Nichole's mom

19:54.410 --> 19:56.847
and to the chef and Alan's
improbably attractive companions

19:56.891 --> 19:58.501
for being so boring

19:58.545 --> 20:02.505
that I will seem fabulous in
comparison no matter what I do.

20:02.549 --> 20:03.289
Aw.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.942
And since it's just you people,

20:04.986 --> 20:08.294
I can finally get
into my comfy clothes.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.299
Hey. Um, I'm sorry
about tonight.

20:13.342 --> 20:16.345
-I should've been spending time
with you... -It's okay.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.391
You know, honestly,
I did for a minute

20:18.434 --> 20:20.175
think there was something
going on with you and Colin.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.873
-There's not. -I know, 'cause
I saw what you did with Nichole,

20:22.917 --> 20:24.397
and I realized you're
just always looking out

20:24.440 --> 20:25.398
for your friends.

20:25.441 --> 20:28.401
Right.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.490
So I know lying
about dating someone's daughter

20:30.533 --> 20:32.274
isn't the best way
to start a relationship.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.972
Well, Dave, anyone who's willing
to help my daughter

20:35.016 --> 20:38.498
and forgo what I hear is
the "tush event of the season"

20:38.541 --> 20:39.673
must be a decent man.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.979
So, here's my number

20:42.023 --> 20:43.851
if that dinner
is still on the table.

20:43.894 --> 20:48.421
Well, no, we'd have to go
and order it first.

20:51.598 --> 20:55.079
Is it...?

20:55.123 --> 20:57.560
So I guess you and my mom
are going on that date, huh?

20:57.604 --> 21:02.086
Yup. Just so you know, I don't
expect for you to call me Dad.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.480
But I look forward to your
wedding day when you finally do.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.136
Where is everyone?

21:08.179 --> 21:09.703
Bernard kicked everyone out.

21:09.746 --> 21:11.095
What are you doing back here?

21:11.139 --> 21:12.183
I thought you left
with New Megan.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.534
I did. But then
we got into the Lyft,

21:14.577 --> 21:16.579
and I saw that her rating
was a 3.6

21:16.623 --> 21:18.668
and I realized
she was a bloody monster.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.671
You were right. I was about
to make a huge mistake.

21:21.715 --> 21:25.806
Well, lucky for you, I'm good
at spotting huge mistakes.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.503
Not avoiding them,
but spotting them.

21:27.547 --> 21:28.809
Yeah.

21:29.723 --> 21:32.465
Everyone! Dinner is served.

21:32.508 --> 21:35.555
Admit it, best birthday ever.

21:35.598 --> 21:39.341
I suppose. I still wish I had
come up with that one last

21:39.385 --> 21:42.692
biblical finale,
but this will have to do.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.999
Alan, who sets a table
like this?

21:45.042 --> 21:47.610
I mean, there aren't
even enough chairs.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.749

21:58.099 --> 22:00.231
You've hit the jackpot withLA to Vegas.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.321
Now here are a few more shows to check out from Fox.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.585
911. What's your emergency?

22:05.628 --> 22:08.065
MAN : I'm on Flight 46, and we're going down.

22:08.109 --> 22:10.807
Just tell my wife I'm so sorry that I cannot come home to you.

22:10.851 --> 22:11.895
Hello?

22:14.071 --> 22:17.031
This is your family.
We got you, okay?

22:18.598 --> 22:19.773
Rapid response now!

22:19.816 --> 22:22.732
-We can't save everyone.

22:22.776 --> 22:25.039
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.
