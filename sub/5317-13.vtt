WEBVTT

00:03.793 --> 00:05.561
So you kissed,
and then what happened?

00:05.595 --> 00:07.697
Then she showed me
her bronze medal.

00:07.730 --> 00:09.832
She did? Why?

00:09.865 --> 00:12.868
Because she was
understandably proud of it.

00:12.902 --> 00:16.206
She... she was proud
of her bronze medal?

00:16.239 --> 00:17.873
It's quite beautiful, close up.

00:18.541 --> 00:19.509
What?

00:19.542 --> 00:20.710
Why would a person

00:20.743 --> 00:22.412
just show someone
their butthole?

00:22.445 --> 00:24.280
What? No!

00:24.314 --> 00:25.448
A real bronze medal.

00:25.481 --> 00:26.716
Oh! Why would you think

00:26.749 --> 00:28.351
I meant a butthole?

00:28.384 --> 00:30.786
Well, you said "bronze medal."

00:30.820 --> 00:32.622
I mean,
it is the third best hole.

00:33.156 --> 00:34.557
Brownish.

00:35.258 --> 00:36.359
So, you're feeling, um...

00:36.392 --> 00:38.128
Human.

00:38.161 --> 00:40.029
A little human. Huh.

00:40.062 --> 00:40.963
So, next time you feel,

00:40.996 --> 00:43.466
you know, "it" coming on,
maybe you

00:43.499 --> 00:45.768
should try switching your meds?
Meds?

00:45.801 --> 00:47.637
You're not on anti-depressants?

00:47.670 --> 00:49.239
Shit, no. I don't want
to lose my edge.

00:49.272 --> 00:50.773
What?

00:50.806 --> 00:52.308
So you're-you're telling me

00:52.342 --> 00:53.809
you could have just taken a pill

00:53.843 --> 00:55.378
this whole time and you didn't?

00:55.411 --> 00:56.412
Nope.

00:56.446 --> 00:58.114
Wow!

00:58.148 --> 00:59.315
Well...

01:00.483 --> 01:01.551
Wow!

01:01.584 --> 01:03.953
We just proved
I don't need medication.

01:03.986 --> 01:06.489
You actually can fix me!

01:06.522 --> 01:08.558
My bad.

01:09.825 --> 01:10.926
You're upright!

01:10.960 --> 01:12.395
Why do you have two burgers?

01:12.428 --> 01:13.829
One's for my baby.

01:13.863 --> 01:15.298
New Tinder rando?

01:15.331 --> 01:16.766
No, the baby in my pussy.

01:16.799 --> 01:19.302
Bye. Jesus Christ, Lindser!

01:19.335 --> 01:20.470
Are you serious?

01:21.371 --> 01:23.173
That microwave thing
actually worked?

01:23.206 --> 01:25.475
Guess so. I just heated it up
like a baked potato.

01:25.508 --> 01:28.678
So, you and me, abobo
and then Marie Callender's?

01:28.711 --> 01:30.413
Sure. You know what's funny?

01:30.446 --> 01:32.415
Two weeks ago,

01:32.448 --> 01:33.783
I would have trapped Paul

01:33.816 --> 01:35.851
and torpedoed
his gross relationship

01:35.885 --> 01:37.487
with Crunchy Princess Limp Hair.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.954
But I think I've matured.

01:38.988 --> 01:39.989
Amy was right.

01:40.022 --> 01:42.592
I had a perfect man
and I let him go.

01:42.625 --> 01:45.261
Linds, you never liked Paul.

01:45.295 --> 01:47.297
You only referred to him
as dork,

01:47.330 --> 01:50.032
Lumpy Hubby, Paul Nye
the Science Homo...

01:50.065 --> 01:51.710
Do you think he's going to be
at Becca's baby shower later?

01:51.734 --> 01:53.002
You going to tell him?

01:53.035 --> 01:53.969
No.

01:54.003 --> 01:55.205
I'm moving on.

01:56.306 --> 01:59.008
So, who's this basic ho

01:59.041 --> 02:00.343
Jimmy hooked up with?

02:00.376 --> 02:01.477
Oh, it doesn't matter.

02:01.511 --> 02:02.945
Huh. If I were you,

02:02.978 --> 02:04.022
I would totally want to see

02:04.046 --> 02:05.648
what brand of slizz
I was up against.

02:37.713 --> 02:38.914
Oh!

02:54.364 --> 02:55.531
Uh-uh-uh.

02:55.565 --> 02:57.900
You are not serving your
stale, mail-order popcorn.

02:57.933 --> 03:00.936
Babe, people love fancy popcorn,
it's a proven fact.

03:00.970 --> 03:03.873
All right. As long as there's
no trash juice this time.

03:03.906 --> 03:04.674
'Course not. I promised.

03:04.707 --> 03:07.109
All right.

03:11.381 --> 03:13.048
Becca, you dummy.

03:15.585 --> 03:16.852
There's Jimmy's car.

03:16.886 --> 03:18.388
You'll feel better

03:18.421 --> 03:19.689
after you tell him.

03:19.722 --> 03:21.791
You know, maybe-maybe
I'll still drive over

03:21.824 --> 03:23.359
every morning
to cook him breakfast

03:23.393 --> 03:25.595
until he eventually
discovers I've moved out,

03:25.628 --> 03:27.263
and by then, he'll see

03:27.297 --> 03:28.907
it won't have to change
anything between us.

03:28.931 --> 03:30.800
Things need to change
between you, Edgar.

03:30.833 --> 03:32.134
You're always saying that.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.246
Well, I always say I didn't
know it was a school, too.

03:34.270 --> 03:35.805
Look, I want you to feel proud

03:35.838 --> 03:37.148
that you're going to be
living with me.

03:37.172 --> 03:38.308
You're right.

03:38.341 --> 03:39.375
I'll tell him.

03:39.409 --> 03:41.611
Thank you.

03:41.644 --> 03:42.612
Wait, about that school...

03:42.645 --> 03:43.546
Oh, kidding.

03:43.579 --> 03:45.981
I totally didn't know.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.151
You're goddamn pregnant?

03:49.184 --> 03:50.753
I'm not keeping it.

03:50.786 --> 03:53.088
Well, I should hope not.

03:53.122 --> 03:54.333
And I'm gonna be a good sister.

03:54.357 --> 03:55.458
I'm not drinking.

03:55.491 --> 03:56.735
I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows

03:56.759 --> 03:58.561
this is your day.

03:58.594 --> 04:01.864
I even brought lemons this time,
like you asked.

04:02.865 --> 04:03.833
Uh...

04:03.866 --> 04:05.601
Please don't tell Paul.

04:05.635 --> 04:07.169
Of course not.

04:07.202 --> 04:10.172
What a disaster.

04:14.477 --> 04:15.778
I can have one.

04:20.616 --> 04:22.652
The popcorn is trash juice.

04:22.685 --> 04:25.555
Pass it on.

04:26.989 --> 04:28.758
I need to tell you something.

04:28.791 --> 04:30.460
Gretchen has never taken meds!

04:30.493 --> 04:32.294
Really? After all that?

04:32.328 --> 04:33.796
Exactly.

04:33.829 --> 04:36.098
And then she said
she doesn't ever need to now,

04:36.131 --> 04:37.600
because she has me to fix her.

04:37.633 --> 04:40.436
Between her, you, Killian,

04:40.470 --> 04:42.705
I have to be the
emotional bedrock for everyone.

04:42.738 --> 04:44.774
When's it my turn
to be taken care of?

04:44.807 --> 04:45.808
You know what?

04:45.841 --> 04:46.842
Today.

04:46.876 --> 04:48.678
Today's my turn.

04:48.711 --> 04:51.814
I'm going to get
absolutely snozzelled.

04:51.847 --> 04:53.625
Well, this is
leading towards something

04:53.649 --> 04:55.050
dangerously misguided.

04:55.084 --> 04:56.828
We'll see how she likes
taking care of me for a change.

04:56.852 --> 05:00.990
You probably don't want to get
to "Level Two Jimmy drunk"

05:01.023 --> 05:02.958
around all these people.

05:02.992 --> 05:05.595
Or maybe I do.

05:35.925 --> 05:37.727
It's on the house...

05:37.760 --> 05:39.361
Gretchen.

05:43.098 --> 05:44.910
For what it's worth, Jimmy
and I aren't talking right now.

05:44.934 --> 05:46.569
You know nothing
really happened.

05:46.602 --> 05:48.438
Eh, we had problems already.

05:48.471 --> 05:50.172
I'm sorry anyway.

05:50.205 --> 05:51.507
Relationships are tough.

05:51.541 --> 05:53.676
He's just such a child!

05:53.709 --> 05:55.044
The other day,

05:55.077 --> 05:56.879
he bought an $80 toy helicopter

05:56.912 --> 05:58.280
which he broke immediately.

05:58.313 --> 06:00.225
Do you know what he talked to me
about for an hour straight?

06:00.249 --> 06:01.851
Tree houses? Yes!

06:01.884 --> 06:02.952
A full hour!

06:02.985 --> 06:04.454
Yeah, you got off easy.

06:07.490 --> 06:08.724
Let's grab a table.

06:10.626 --> 06:12.962
You're articulate,
brilliant, courageous,

06:12.995 --> 06:17.032
dexterous, enthralling, foxy...

06:17.066 --> 06:18.701
G... galvanizing.

06:18.734 --> 06:20.402
Oh, I love it!

06:20.436 --> 06:22.472
You're articulate,
brilliant, courageous,

06:22.505 --> 06:26.075
dexterous, enthralling,
foxy, galvanizing...

06:26.108 --> 06:28.077
and... horny.

06:28.110 --> 06:29.779
Amy!

06:29.812 --> 06:31.413
I have to go
to the little girls' room.

06:31.447 --> 06:32.414
Save my seat?

06:32.448 --> 06:33.649
Always.

06:36.819 --> 06:37.920
Whew!

06:37.953 --> 06:40.656
Mm.

06:40.690 --> 06:43.826
Just know I'm not really mad
at you for ditching Lindsay.

06:43.859 --> 06:45.895
I mean, you...

06:45.928 --> 06:47.229
you dodged a bullet with that.

06:47.262 --> 06:48.731
And by bullet,

06:48.764 --> 06:51.734
I mean... it's way smaller
than a bullet right now,

06:51.767 --> 06:54.804
but probably just as dumb.

06:54.837 --> 06:56.338
Unless it got your genes.

06:56.371 --> 06:58.240
What?

06:58.273 --> 06:59.341
Oh, dang it.

06:59.374 --> 07:00.510
I guess you figured it out.

07:00.543 --> 07:02.244
My sister impregnated herself

07:02.277 --> 07:03.513
by heating a condom

07:03.546 --> 07:05.147
full of your sperm
in a microwave.

07:05.180 --> 07:08.317
You know, that's
scientifically impossible

07:08.350 --> 07:10.185
in ten different ways.

07:10.219 --> 07:11.186
Of course.

07:11.220 --> 07:13.088
That's my point.

07:13.122 --> 07:14.624
Knowing her,
she probably seduced

07:14.657 --> 07:15.858
the drive-thru guy at Del Taco

07:15.891 --> 07:17.159
and is just saying it's yours.

07:17.192 --> 07:19.194
Well, yes.

07:19.228 --> 07:23.465
There's literally no way we...

07:23.499 --> 07:24.634
Wait.

07:28.838 --> 07:30.005
Oh...

07:33.643 --> 07:35.711
Oh, my God.

07:39.715 --> 07:40.716
Mm!

07:40.750 --> 07:42.451
I can have one.

08:00.502 --> 08:01.837
Mmm.

08:01.871 --> 08:03.539
Fruity.

08:09.579 --> 08:11.213
I seriously thought
I was going crazy,

08:11.246 --> 08:12.414
I was texting and texting,

08:12.447 --> 08:14.316
and then I saw him
lying in the bushes.

08:14.349 --> 08:16.719
One time, Jimmy spilled
a bowl of cereal

08:16.752 --> 08:18.688
when Edgar wasn't home,
so he hid under his bed

08:18.721 --> 08:20.556
for two hours,
until I finally cleaned it up.

08:20.590 --> 08:22.357
And you date him.

08:22.391 --> 08:23.926
Willingly.

08:23.959 --> 08:26.696
The heart is a dumb dumb.

08:26.729 --> 08:28.430
The dumbest dumb of them all.

08:30.065 --> 08:32.001
You're so pretty.

08:32.034 --> 08:35.370
I can see why Jimmy almost
went to the cabin with you.

08:35.404 --> 08:38.874
There's something
so captivating about you.

08:38.908 --> 08:40.075
What is it?

08:40.109 --> 08:42.077
Uh... I don't know.

08:43.477 --> 08:46.882
How can you be
athletic and funny?

08:46.916 --> 08:48.217
Gotta find out.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.961
What are you doing? What?
What are you doing?

08:49.985 --> 08:52.121
What is wrong with you?

08:52.154 --> 08:54.389
I'm not scared, if that's
what you're worried about.

08:54.423 --> 08:55.290
Get out of my bar!

08:55.324 --> 08:56.959
Come on, just kiss me.

08:56.992 --> 08:58.260
You kissed my boyfriend.

08:59.061 --> 09:00.095
Kiss me!

09:00.129 --> 09:01.864
Kiss me!

09:01.897 --> 09:02.765
You kiss me, girl!

09:02.798 --> 09:04.133
Kiss me! Stop!

09:04.166 --> 09:05.567
What is wrong with you guys?

09:05.601 --> 09:07.737
I am a real person! Are you?

09:07.770 --> 09:10.139
You're a skier who owns a bar.

09:10.172 --> 09:11.473
You don't think that sounds

09:11.506 --> 09:13.051
just a little bit
like some male fantasy?

09:13.075 --> 09:14.119
Come on, just kiss my mouth.

09:14.143 --> 09:15.778
Kiss it! This
might be a mistake,

09:15.811 --> 09:17.288
'cause you could have
crazy-person strength, Ow.

09:17.312 --> 09:19.157
But if you don't get the
hell out of my bar, Ow.

09:19.181 --> 09:21.250
I'm going to have
to kick your ass.

09:21.283 --> 09:23.118
God, that was so hot.

09:23.152 --> 09:24.987
Can you believe
the sexual tension between us?

09:40.535 --> 09:42.672
It's occupied.

09:42.705 --> 09:43.605
Occupied!

09:43.639 --> 09:45.641
Vernon, what the heck?

09:45.675 --> 09:46.742
I'm using the toilet!

09:46.776 --> 09:48.610
I need cash. My cards are maxed.

09:48.644 --> 09:49.679
I wrote a bum check

09:49.712 --> 09:51.446
for my latest
malpractice insurance.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.115
Man, I better not mess up
any surgeries!

09:53.148 --> 09:56.018
I just gave you $15,000.

09:56.051 --> 09:57.495
You're the one who gave money
to a money pig.

09:57.519 --> 09:58.520
That's on you.

09:58.553 --> 10:00.422
This isn't a good time.

10:00.455 --> 10:02.424
I just received
some highly enervating news

10:02.457 --> 10:03.959
that has my bowels in a state.

10:03.993 --> 10:05.761
You don't know enervating, Paul!

10:05.795 --> 10:07.005
Come talk to me about enervating

10:07.029 --> 10:08.831
when you got
a goddamn baby on the way

10:08.864 --> 10:10.666
that's gonna cost
at least a half millie

10:10.700 --> 10:11.767
in its stupid life.

10:11.801 --> 10:13.268
Just give me that money,
turkey-dick!

10:13.302 --> 10:14.704
You shut the hell up,

10:14.737 --> 10:15.971
Vernon! Goddamn it.

10:16.005 --> 10:19.174
Get the hell out of this
bathroom Where is it?!

10:19.208 --> 10:22.211
Or I will destroy you and
everything that you love!

10:22.244 --> 10:25.280
I will smother you in your
sleep, so help me God! Ow.

10:25.314 --> 10:27.516
I hate you!
Give me that money, nerd!

10:27.549 --> 10:30.119
Get out, get out, get out!

10:30.152 --> 10:31.653
Ah! Stop it!

10:31.687 --> 10:33.188
Get out! God!

10:33.222 --> 10:35.791
You are such an asshole.
Get out!

10:35.825 --> 10:38.493
I wish you were dead!

10:44.566 --> 10:45.534
Where's Gretchen?

10:45.567 --> 10:47.236
Jimmy, I'm moving out.

10:47.269 --> 10:50.039
I'm so sorry,
but the time has come

10:50.072 --> 10:51.974
for me to strike out
on my own, and I...

10:52.007 --> 10:54.043
Ooh, you have to get a place
with a pool. Or a gym.

10:54.076 --> 10:56.245
Ac-Actually,
we already have a place.

10:56.278 --> 10:56.879
We?

10:56.912 --> 10:58.513
Me and Dorothy. What?

10:58.547 --> 11:00.382
You've only known her
for about an hour, man.

11:00.415 --> 11:03.919
Who else do you know who moved
in with someone way too soon?

11:03.953 --> 11:05.287
Hmm?

11:06.956 --> 11:08.157
Me!

11:08.190 --> 11:10.159
I got saddled with a lemon.

11:10.192 --> 11:11.193
Guess what I spent

11:11.226 --> 11:13.395
all afternoon doing Wednesday?

11:13.428 --> 11:15.765
I sat in a pillow fort

11:15.798 --> 11:16.999
while she wept.

11:17.032 --> 11:18.267
So boring.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.735
Wait, Wednesday?

11:19.769 --> 11:22.004
That's why you missed my show?

11:22.037 --> 11:23.538
And no one can see
you have a lemon.

11:23.572 --> 11:25.040
You pull up to the valet

11:25.074 --> 11:27.276
and people are like,
"Ooh, nice car,"

11:27.309 --> 11:29.549
but they can't see all the work
it needs on the interior.

11:30.279 --> 11:31.380
And then...

11:31.413 --> 11:33.015
you find out there was
a factory recall

11:33.048 --> 11:35.250
and that they could've
fixed it themselves?

11:37.252 --> 11:38.587
Oh, no.

11:38.620 --> 11:40.089
Level Two Jimmy drunk:

11:40.122 --> 11:41.791
Angry Jimmy.

11:41.824 --> 11:43.525
Okay, just slow down

11:43.558 --> 11:46.061
before you get yourself
to Level Three.

11:46.095 --> 11:48.097
Whose idea was this?

11:48.130 --> 11:49.431
Mine.

11:49.464 --> 11:51.266
And when did you have it?

11:51.300 --> 11:55.370
When she took me to go see an
apartment that she couldn't...

11:55.404 --> 11:57.907
quite afford on her own.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.768
You're scaring me.

12:33.675 --> 12:35.744
Have you seen the
rest of the house?

12:35.777 --> 12:37.312
Yikes.

12:37.346 --> 12:39.581
It is literally
the exact opposite

12:39.614 --> 12:41.150
of how we should
decorate our place.

12:41.183 --> 12:43.252
There's a framed poster
of G. Love & Special Sauce.

12:43.285 --> 12:44.519
I shit you not.

12:44.553 --> 12:45.754
I can't move in with you.

12:45.787 --> 12:47.389
What? Why?

12:49.724 --> 12:54.363
Turns out, Jimmy missed the show
for a really good reason,

12:54.396 --> 12:56.031
and-and-and I...
I just got angry,

12:56.065 --> 12:57.632
and I made this rash
decision, and...

12:57.666 --> 12:59.935
Okay, honey, listen to me.

12:59.969 --> 13:03.672
This is your chance to
start your life over.

13:03.705 --> 13:05.807
With me.

13:05.841 --> 13:07.509
You're ready.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.544
No, but I'm not ready
for what you want from me.

13:11.213 --> 13:12.915
You tell me that I am,
but I'm not.

13:14.850 --> 13:15.784
Maybe in a few years.

13:17.152 --> 13:18.453
I don't have a few years.

13:18.487 --> 13:22.124
I spent four years too goddamn
long in that comedy house

13:22.157 --> 13:24.226
'cause I thought we
were going somewhere.

13:24.259 --> 13:26.962
I don't have any
more time to waste.

13:26.996 --> 13:28.197
I'm sorry.

13:32.935 --> 13:35.905
I can't believe this.

13:35.938 --> 13:38.173
Goddamn you, Edgar.

13:52.587 --> 13:54.656
Okay, uh, everyone, hello.

13:54.689 --> 13:57.426
Hi, everybody,
gather round, please.

13:58.693 --> 14:01.330
Well, the moment
of truth has arrived.

14:01.363 --> 14:03.832
In just a minute, we are gonna
be cutting into that cake,

14:03.865 --> 14:05.534
and depending on its color,

14:05.567 --> 14:07.202
finding out
if we're gonna raising

14:07.236 --> 14:10.205
a-a precious little baby girl
or a macho boy.

14:10.239 --> 14:12.041
Isn't that fun?

14:12.074 --> 14:14.209
We want to... Hello.

14:14.243 --> 14:15.444
Sorry.

14:15.477 --> 14:18.080
I'd just like
to say a few words.

14:18.113 --> 14:19.748
Okay, now is not
really the time.

14:19.781 --> 14:21.583
It's cool, Bec... It's all love.

14:21.616 --> 14:22.884
Oh, my God, Level Three.

14:22.918 --> 14:24.219
No, it's not, Becca.

14:24.253 --> 14:25.720
Happy Jimmy.

14:25.754 --> 14:28.523
Becca, y-you... are so special.

14:28.557 --> 14:29.591
No, I'm serious.

14:29.624 --> 14:31.360
You take in my words.

14:31.393 --> 14:33.762
You accept how special you are.

14:33.795 --> 14:35.797
You are a treasure.

14:35.830 --> 14:37.542
Okay. JIMMY: Come here.

14:37.566 --> 14:38.944
Come here, I'm gonna hug on you.
Okay.

14:40.569 --> 14:42.204
Look at this woman...

14:42.237 --> 14:45.474
She's like a lioness on
the savannah,

14:45.507 --> 14:48.944
just preparing to expel her...

14:48.978 --> 14:50.879
It must have been
my pre-ejaculate.

14:50.912 --> 14:53.282
Goddamn, Becca.

14:53.315 --> 14:56.051
Since we broke up, I
started life-logging.

14:56.085 --> 14:57.719
I record everything.

14:57.752 --> 15:01.656
My conversations, bowel
movements, fitness.

15:01.690 --> 15:04.759
My life in searchable data.

15:04.793 --> 15:06.295
And according to my records,

15:06.328 --> 15:10.399
we did have unprotected vaginal
intercourse for 37 seconds

15:10.432 --> 15:12.001
before I donned a sheath.

15:12.034 --> 15:16.471
Though the odds of conception
from pre-ejaculate are narrow,

15:16.505 --> 15:20.175
as you know, I do have
a heavy seminal load

15:20.209 --> 15:22.911
of high viscosity and opacity.

15:22.944 --> 15:25.747
Oh, what happened to your face?

15:25.780 --> 15:28.450
Amy was signing so fast
with her left hand,

15:28.483 --> 15:30.119
I didn't see the
right hook coming.

15:30.152 --> 15:31.953
She hit you? And more.

15:31.987 --> 15:34.456
Why? 'Cause I broke up with her.

15:35.724 --> 15:38.027
Do you remember when I told
you the definition of love

15:38.060 --> 15:41.130
was putting someone else's
needs above your own,

15:41.163 --> 15:42.964
and you said, "Ew"?

15:42.998 --> 15:44.199
Ew.

15:44.233 --> 15:45.367
I mean, yes.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.002
Tonight, you put me first

15:47.036 --> 15:49.771
when you decided not to
trap me with your pregnancy.

15:49.804 --> 15:51.306
I quit on you.

15:51.340 --> 15:53.308
I was a hypocrite.

15:53.342 --> 15:55.844
So, Lindsay...

15:55.877 --> 15:57.446
let's have baby.

15:57.479 --> 16:00.282
I don't know, Paul.

16:00.315 --> 16:03.652
I was really unhappy.

16:05.687 --> 16:07.522
Think about it, okay?

16:11.193 --> 16:13.728
It's just so sad, you know?

16:13.762 --> 16:16.731
Level Four.

16:16.765 --> 16:18.667
I've only heard about this.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.669
Edgar.

16:20.702 --> 16:23.672
My confidant.

16:23.705 --> 16:27.676
A Grumio to my Petruchio.

16:27.709 --> 16:30.912
The sweetest man
I've ever known.

16:32.681 --> 16:36.718
It's so beautiful that you
and Dorothy found each other.

16:36.751 --> 16:39.154
But I just... I just
broke up with her.

16:39.188 --> 16:40.889
Why'd you do that?

16:40.922 --> 16:42.824
You told me to.

16:42.857 --> 16:45.094
But Dorothy's amazing.

16:45.127 --> 16:47.028
You said she manipulated me.

16:47.062 --> 16:49.164
So what?

16:49.198 --> 16:51.233
Go!

16:52.601 --> 16:55.537
Hey, I know it's cliché,

16:55.570 --> 16:58.873
but, really, what-what
if there were no possessions?

16:58.907 --> 17:00.342
Can you imagine that?

17:00.375 --> 17:03.512
Uh, do you guys know
my girlfriend, Gretchen?

17:03.545 --> 17:05.847
She's supposed to be here.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.550
She got sad for a long time.

17:08.583 --> 17:10.185
That was hard.

17:10.219 --> 17:12.454
I'm used to being
the complicated one.

17:12.487 --> 17:14.123
Like, with-with Becca.

17:14.156 --> 17:17.559
Becca's, uh, like
a Monday crossword.

17:17.592 --> 17:18.926
Gretchen...

17:18.960 --> 17:21.695
Sunday.

17:21.730 --> 17:24.299
Takes-takes all day,

17:24.333 --> 17:27.269
but it's rewarding as hell.

17:28.303 --> 17:30.539
Gretchen!

17:30.572 --> 17:33.942
You had a little too much
to drink, didn't you, buddy?

17:35.277 --> 17:37.579
Gretchen, what the hell
am I doing up here?

17:37.612 --> 17:39.781
Aw, I know.

17:41.116 --> 17:45.086
Y-You... have to help me,

17:45.120 --> 17:46.621
'cause my turn.

17:46.655 --> 17:48.823
It is, Jimmy.

17:50.125 --> 17:53.828
Okay, oh,
I'm so sorry, everybody.

17:53.862 --> 17:55.664
Vernon.

17:55.697 --> 17:57.599
My father was a petty man.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.469
Demeaning.

18:00.502 --> 18:01.936
Stingy.

18:01.970 --> 18:04.273
I think that's why I'm
so scared to be a father.

18:04.306 --> 18:06.608
Vernon, put down
that mic right now.

18:06.641 --> 18:09.678
No, I have been silent too long!

18:09.711 --> 18:11.079
I became a doctor...

18:11.112 --> 18:12.981
because I was born dead,

18:13.014 --> 18:15.016
but do you guys have any idea...

18:15.049 --> 18:16.685
You never came.

18:16.718 --> 18:18.663
I tried to kiss Nina, and
she kicked me out of her bar.

18:18.687 --> 18:20.322
What?

18:20.355 --> 18:22.157
But you're so hot.

18:22.191 --> 18:23.825
I'm so hot.

18:23.858 --> 18:25.827
Did you wear your booby shirt?

18:25.860 --> 18:27.196
Of course I wore my booby shirt.

18:27.229 --> 18:29.631
Anyway, I can see what
you like about her.

18:29.664 --> 18:30.799
She's hella foxy.

18:30.832 --> 18:32.767
She a'ight.

18:32.801 --> 18:35.337
Ooh.

18:35.370 --> 18:36.871
I have a
problem, you guys.

18:36.905 --> 18:40.209
I gave control of my finances
to a woman I don't know.

18:40.242 --> 18:41.976
There's nothing sexual about it.

18:42.010 --> 18:43.645
Fine, I jack off
to it sometimes,

18:43.678 --> 18:44.946
but that's not what it's about.

18:46.248 --> 18:49.284
I regret being born dead,

18:49.318 --> 18:52.321
and I regret not being ready
to be a father,

18:52.354 --> 18:55.156
and I regret going
to see The Babadook.

18:55.190 --> 18:57.492
It was so scary, you guys.

18:57.526 --> 19:00.729
But mostly I regret
hurting my wife.

19:00.762 --> 19:03.732
I regret, but I am not
ashamed anymore.

19:03.765 --> 19:06.067
I am not ashamed.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.302
But I reiterate...

19:07.336 --> 19:10.305
Do not see The Babadook.

19:10.339 --> 19:11.206
Whatever you do!

21:03.552 --> 21:05.620
Listen, no, I'm not
ready to live with you,

21:05.654 --> 21:07.589
but does that mean
we have to break up?

21:07.622 --> 21:10.592
Because when two people
connect like I think we do,

21:10.625 --> 21:13.862
I refuse to believe
that things have to just end.

21:13.895 --> 21:15.630
That's madness.

21:15.664 --> 21:18.099
I-I refuse to believe
that life has to be like that.

21:18.132 --> 21:19.668
I simply refuse.

21:19.701 --> 21:22.837
Life has to make
more sense than that.

21:22.871 --> 21:24.873
Dude, we just got
in a little fight.

21:24.906 --> 21:28.142
And now I'm taking the bus home
to show you how mad I am.

21:28.176 --> 21:30.345
You're supposed to come after me.
Oh.

21:30.379 --> 21:32.180
You thought we broke up?

21:33.482 --> 21:35.216
People don't behave
like that, dummy.

21:38.887 --> 21:40.455
Want to go get some food,

21:40.489 --> 21:42.557
help me figure out how
to get my deposit back?

21:42.591 --> 21:44.926
Yes. Yes, I do.

22:23.432 --> 22:25.400
How much money?

22:25.434 --> 22:27.902
So much.

22:27.936 --> 22:30.104
Mmm.

22:58.833 --> 22:59.801
Good?

22:59.834 --> 23:01.570
Yeah.

23:17.018 --> 23:18.653
I got a new hobby.

23:18.687 --> 23:19.888
What is it?

23:57.726 --> 23:59.861
I'm gonna talk
to someone about it.

23:59.894 --> 24:03.665
A doctor someone.

24:03.698 --> 24:06.300
Maybe see about some medication.

24:08.202 --> 24:10.805
It's always been
just me, you know?

24:10.839 --> 24:12.340
Now it's not anymore.

24:14.509 --> 24:16.010
Thank you.

24:21.482 --> 24:23.017
You know,

24:23.051 --> 24:25.162
after I cleaned the fries off
your face and put you to bed,

24:25.186 --> 24:29.190
you said something to me
that was pretty dark.

24:29.223 --> 24:31.392
Don't tell me.

24:33.227 --> 24:35.396
Okay, I won't.

24:37.666 --> 24:39.433
I love you, too.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.216
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

25:41.630 --> 25:43.598
Well, back on the clock.

25:45.767 --> 25:47.301
Yeah, okay.

25:56.510 --> 26:00.081
Fargo. All-new,
Mondays at 10:00 on FX.

26:01.515 --> 26:03.484
Hey, you must be
the new neighbors.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.757
- Okay.
- This January...

26:08.790 --> 26:10.625
Top of the mornin',
you filthy lads.

26:10.659 --> 26:12.560
- The all new season...
- Oh!

26:12.593 --> 26:15.339
This whole thing's gonna be a fiasco,
and I'm gonna enjoy every second of it.

26:15.363 --> 26:17.231
No, it's gonna go fine.
No, it isn't.

26:17.265 --> 26:19.433
Sunny. Premieres
Wednesday, January 6.

26:19.467 --> 26:21.269

26:24.338 --> 26:26.474
- Hey, lock up your daughters.
- Ugh.

26:29.944 --> 26:32.814
And that was the last time
I ate Indian food before a date.

26:35.349 --> 26:38.352
What do I do-do?
Currently I am...

26:39.387 --> 26:42.156
a temp.

26:42.190 --> 26:44.258
And you must be from Tennessee

26:44.292 --> 26:46.460
because you're the only
"10 I see." -

26:46.494 --> 26:48.096
Man Seeking Woman.

26:48.129 --> 26:49.964

26:53.634 --> 26:56.805
I'll have the number 57.

26:56.838 --> 26:59.373
- That's the price.
- In that case, I'll have the number four.

26:59.407 --> 27:00.975
A carrot.

27:01.910 --> 27:03.411
Yes, the carrot, please.

27:10.819 --> 27:12.821
Don't feel sorry for me.

27:12.854 --> 27:15.356
I've had a great life.

27:15.389 --> 27:18.960
Thanks

27:18.993 --> 27:20.494
Peace and love.
