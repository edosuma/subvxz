WEBVTT

00:09.630 --> 00:12.183
Guys,
guess what I found.

00:15.396 --> 00:17.808
Where did you
get a dog?

00:17.808 --> 00:19.140
And please do not say
from a guy

00:19.140 --> 00:20.641
with sunglasses
and a cane.

00:20.641 --> 00:22.403
No.

00:22.403 --> 00:24.735
He started sniffing me
when I got on the hydraloop,

00:24.735 --> 00:26.697
then he went crazy
and wouldn't leave me alone.

00:26.697 --> 00:30.741
And did you by any chance
have meat in your pockets?

00:30.741 --> 00:32.493
No!

00:32.493 --> 00:34.825
Wait, is salami a meat?

00:36.457 --> 00:38.038
He can't stay.

00:39.460 --> 00:42.253
Whoa. Did you see that?

00:42.253 --> 00:44.125
You said stay,
and he did.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.257
He's a genius.

00:47.798 --> 00:50.801
Otis?!

00:50.801 --> 00:52.723
- [whistles]
- [whimpers]

00:52.723 --> 00:55.636
Oh, that's my dog.

00:55.636 --> 00:58.349
He was a stray I took in
and nursed back to health

00:58.349 --> 01:01.732
back when Krane and I
bought our first
evil lair together.

01:01.732 --> 01:04.565
Actually, it was more
of an evil townhouse.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.358
How were we ever
afraid of you?

01:08.989 --> 01:11.742
This guy got me through
some pretty rough times.

01:11.742 --> 01:13.194
Well, it's nice to hear

01:13.194 --> 01:14.995
that you had
someone to comfort you

01:14.995 --> 01:16.997
while you were
plotting to kill us.

01:16.997 --> 01:20.581
I think Otis ran away
because Krane terrified him.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.043
He must've been
searching for me forever.

01:23.043 --> 01:25.206
I bet he smelled
my scent on Adam,

01:25.206 --> 01:27.208
and followed him
back here.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.049
Are you sure
it's the same dog?

01:29.049 --> 01:30.711
Absolutely.
Watch this.

01:30.711 --> 01:32.263
Otis, sit.

01:32.263 --> 01:36.347
- Look left.
- Look right.

01:36.347 --> 01:39.019
- Speak.
- [barks]

01:39.019 --> 01:42.723
Whoa. I can't even
do all that.

01:42.723 --> 01:45.025
I'll tell you
another little secret.

01:45.025 --> 01:47.858
Otis has
super strength.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.069
Wait.

01:49.069 --> 01:51.782
You gave bionics
to an animal?

01:51.782 --> 01:54.034
He was injured,
and I did it
to save his life.

01:54.034 --> 01:55.826
I'm glad you saved him,
but I can't believe

01:55.826 --> 01:58.118
you wasted bionics
on a dog.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.241
I wouldn't say wasted.

02:00.241 --> 02:02.953
Do your thing, Otis.

02:05.045 --> 02:08.048
Whoa! Cool.

02:08.048 --> 02:10.251
I thought I was gonna
have to train him to do that.

02:12.803 --> 02:14.885
The world's first
bionic superhumans...

02:14.885 --> 02:17.137
they're stronger than us,

02:17.137 --> 02:19.890
faster, smarter.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.683
The next generation
of the human race is...

02:22.683 --> 02:24.565
living on a bionic island.

03:03.724 --> 03:05.806
[sneezes]

03:05.806 --> 03:06.977
Chase, could you
keep it down?

03:06.977 --> 03:08.769
Otis and I
are playing cards.

03:10.150 --> 03:12.693
All right,
what do ya got?

03:14.775 --> 03:16.987
Another ace?

03:16.987 --> 03:19.700
You're a lot better
than the other dogs

03:19.700 --> 03:21.372
I play with.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.377
Adam, that fur factory
is making me sneeze.

03:26.377 --> 03:27.708
You have got to
get rid of him.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.960
Stop right there.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.293
Otis is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

03:32.293 --> 03:33.964
Oh, really?

03:33.964 --> 03:35.796
Better than being
a bionic superhuman,

03:35.796 --> 03:36.927
and going on
life-saving missions?

03:36.927 --> 03:39.840
Mm-hmm. He lets me
rub his belly.

03:42.142 --> 03:43.394
What's up, Otis?

03:43.394 --> 03:44.805
[sneezes]

03:44.805 --> 03:47.308
Is he still
making you sneeze?

03:47.308 --> 03:49.900
Yes. I must be
allergic to him.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.612
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:51.612 --> 03:53.524
How do you know
he's not allergic to you?

03:53.524 --> 03:55.406
- Adam.
- Okay. Chill out.

03:55.406 --> 03:57.488
I know just the thing
that'll make you feel better.

03:57.488 --> 03:58.699
Hit it, Otis.

04:02.703 --> 04:06.707
[playing up-tempo tune]

04:14.965 --> 04:17.298
Not his best.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.300
He's much better
on guitar.

04:22.052 --> 04:24.845
Adam, I know
you love Otis,

04:24.845 --> 04:26.387
I do, too.

04:26.387 --> 04:28.809
But Chase can't
live like this.

04:28.809 --> 04:31.482
Fine. I have a solution.

04:31.482 --> 04:34.735
- Chase lives in a bubble.
- I'm not living in a bubble.

04:34.735 --> 04:37.277
You're right. It'll be
much easier if you
just leave the island.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.700
Thank you for your service,
and good luck.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.822
No, no.

04:41.822 --> 04:44.955
He's right.
Chase was here first,

04:44.955 --> 04:48.038
so Otis has to go.

04:48.038 --> 04:53.464
Oh, thank you so much
for choosing me
over a dog.

04:53.464 --> 04:55.836
Well, it wasn't easy.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.802
How could you
just cave like that?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.385
Relax. We're not
gettin' rid of Otis.

05:04.385 --> 05:05.846
Oh, I get it.

05:05.846 --> 05:08.639
So we're taking Chase
to the pound.

05:08.639 --> 05:11.311
No, we're gonna hide Otis.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.895
Right. Then we take
Chase to the pound.

05:18.699 --> 05:20.651
So bottom line,
sweetie pie,

05:20.651 --> 05:25.906
I really am the glue that binds
this bionic team together.

05:25.906 --> 05:28.288
[girl] Leo, I love it when
you talk about you.

05:28.288 --> 05:31.291
And I love that you love
when I talk about me.

05:31.291 --> 05:33.794
I could talk to you
all day, Leo.

05:33.794 --> 05:36.086
So glad you're my lady.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.169
Who you talking to, Leo?

05:39.169 --> 05:40.961
Mr. Davenport.

05:40.961 --> 05:43.724
That sounded like
a girl.

05:43.724 --> 05:46.847
I think we can both
agree that is one
of his many faults.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.600
Leo.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.732
Okay.

05:51.732 --> 05:53.684
It's this new girl
I've been talking to.

05:53.684 --> 05:57.688
Wow. I never knew you
were such a ladies' man.

05:57.688 --> 05:59.860
I've been trying
to tell you.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.692
- Hey, Leo.
 - Yes, beautiful.

06:01.692 --> 06:03.073
My battery's
at four percent.

06:03.073 --> 06:04.655
Could you put me
on the charger?

06:07.157 --> 06:09.620
Wait. The girl that
you've been talking to

06:09.620 --> 06:11.702
is your phone?

06:11.702 --> 06:13.754
No.

06:13.754 --> 06:15.916
What makes you
say that?

06:15.916 --> 06:18.549
Shelly, stop vibrating.
I'll charge you later.

06:20.050 --> 06:24.214
Okay. Shelly's
my new smartphone assistant.

06:24.214 --> 06:26.427
It started off as
a few meaningless reminders.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.969
Leo, don't forget your wallet.
Leo, brush your teeth.

06:28.969 --> 06:31.562
Leo, the bus is here
to take you to wacky town.

06:31.562 --> 06:34.064
But she learned
all my habits.

06:34.064 --> 06:36.567
Now she knows me
better than anyone.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.819
Shelly gets me,
and for 39.99 a month,

06:38.819 --> 06:40.981
she's gonna continue
to get me.

06:40.981 --> 06:43.193
Look, I don't know
what's sadder--

06:43.193 --> 06:44.905
the fact that you're
dating your phone,

06:44.905 --> 06:46.737
or that I think
your phone can do better.

06:50.791 --> 06:53.123
Otis, Chase is coming.
Hide.

06:55.626 --> 06:57.458
I can still
see you.

07:03.804 --> 07:06.136
Adam, are you
reading a book?

07:06.136 --> 07:08.428
No, I'm pretending
to read a book.

07:11.852 --> 07:14.725
Oh, why am I still
sneezing?

07:14.725 --> 07:17.688
Because you refuse
to live in a bubble.

07:20.521 --> 07:22.322
Pretty smooth, huh?

07:22.322 --> 07:24.064
Come on, Otis.

07:24.064 --> 07:25.696
I think it's time for you
to teach me that chess game

07:25.696 --> 07:28.028
you're always
talking about.

07:28.028 --> 07:30.330
Aha!

07:30.330 --> 07:31.702
I knew it.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.203
My allergies are worse
than ever.

07:33.203 --> 07:36.076
- You kept Otis.
- What? No.
That's not Otis.

07:36.076 --> 07:38.749
Stand, Otis.

07:38.749 --> 07:42.292
This... is
our long-lost cousin...

07:42.292 --> 07:44.134
Bolgia...

07:45.546 --> 07:50.050
From the old country,
where shaving is illegal.

07:51.642 --> 07:55.355
Adam, that's a dog
in a blanket.

07:55.355 --> 07:59.019
Look, I know she's not
the most attractive woman,

07:59.019 --> 08:01.151
but she's family.

08:02.813 --> 08:05.776
[beeping]

08:05.776 --> 08:08.368
Oh, no. There's been
an accident

08:08.368 --> 08:10.280
- in the explosives area.
- Let's go.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.112
Come on, Bolgia.

08:12.112 --> 08:15.876
Let's show Chase that trick
where you run like a dog.

08:17.958 --> 08:19.499
Check it out, Shelly.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.671
I borrowed
someone else's phone

08:20.671 --> 08:22.833
so I could get a selfie
of both of us.

08:22.833 --> 08:26.797
Oh, that was
so thoughtful.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.800
Perfect. Now let's get one of me
whispering in your ear.

08:31.722 --> 08:34.804
- Leo.
- This is normal;
I'm not ashamed.

08:34.804 --> 08:38.138
Okay, this has gone on
long enough.

08:38.138 --> 08:41.400
You're inside all day,
you've stopped bathing,

08:41.400 --> 08:43.813
and every time I try
to call you, it goes
straight to voicemail.

08:43.813 --> 08:45.856
[Shelly giggling]
 That's 'cause I blocked
your calls.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.910
That's naughty.

08:49.910 --> 08:52.703
That's it. You have got
to break up with that machine.

08:52.703 --> 08:54.534
Are you crazy?!

08:54.534 --> 08:55.706
She can hear you.

08:55.706 --> 08:57.578
She is right
in my hand.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.620
Am I crazy?

08:59.620 --> 09:01.081
You're in love
with a phone.

09:01.081 --> 09:03.794
- You love me?
 - We'll talk later.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.256
This isn't healthy.

09:06.256 --> 09:08.799
Sure, it's just a bunch of
conversations right now,
but then what?

09:08.799 --> 09:10.971
You gonna go
take her out for
a big night on the town?

09:10.971 --> 09:12.633
She does know
all the best places,

09:12.633 --> 09:14.514
and the quickest ways
to get there.

09:14.514 --> 09:17.888
[sighs]
Leo, aside from me,

09:17.888 --> 09:22.062
when was the last time
you interacted with
a real person?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.774
For your information,

09:23.774 --> 09:25.525
I've talked to
a lot of real people.

09:25.525 --> 09:27.147
The lady I bought
Shelly's case from,

09:27.147 --> 09:28.859
the guy who set up
Shelly's calling plan,

09:28.859 --> 09:31.151
the dude from tech support
who... okay, this is bad.

09:31.151 --> 09:32.823
I need help.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.408
Douglas!

09:40.791 --> 09:43.163
- What happened?
- I don't know.

09:43.163 --> 09:44.625
I was in here
doing inventory,

09:44.625 --> 09:46.296
and when I turned
the corner,

09:46.296 --> 09:47.838
I tripped on something
and everything fell.

09:51.211 --> 09:53.634
Well, we know one thing.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.385
This was no accident.

09:55.385 --> 09:57.177
Someone strung
a trip wire.

09:57.177 --> 10:02.022
Right. And it was
stretched from here
to here, which means

10:02.022 --> 10:06.857
it had to have been
someone with at least
12-foot arms.

10:10.190 --> 10:13.153
Someone rigged that wire
to the explosives.

10:13.153 --> 10:15.285
If it had worked,
the whole place
would've blown,

10:15.285 --> 10:16.366
with you in it.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.159
Otis, sniff.

10:19.159 --> 10:21.621
Okay. Go get
the bad guy.

10:23.744 --> 10:25.836
Oh. I knew it.

10:25.836 --> 10:27.507
It was you!

10:27.507 --> 10:28.959
I live here.

10:28.959 --> 10:31.171
Why would I want to
blow this place up?

10:31.171 --> 10:35.175
Don't ask me to explain
the motives of a mad man.

10:36.807 --> 10:38.809
Let me measure your arms.

10:40.430 --> 10:41.812
Got a tape measure?

10:57.868 --> 10:59.659
Bang, bang.

11:02.042 --> 11:05.786
I checked every inch
of the explosives area.

11:05.786 --> 11:08.048
I still can't figure out
who set that trap.

11:08.048 --> 11:11.381
Oh, please,
end the charade,
you demented genius.

11:11.381 --> 11:13.844
I'm gonna go scan
the security footage

11:13.844 --> 11:15.756
to see who's responsible.

11:20.140 --> 11:23.063
And would somebody please
get that dog off the island.

11:23.063 --> 11:25.726
All right, Adam.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.728
The jig is up.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.730
I have to take Otis
back to the mainland.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.812
Oh, fine.

11:31.812 --> 11:33.523
[whimpers]

11:33.523 --> 11:36.526
Oh, wait, he wants
to say good-bye.

11:36.526 --> 11:38.118
I know, buddy.

11:38.118 --> 11:40.320
I'm gonna miss you, too.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.244
I'll think of you every time
I drag my butt across the rug.

11:58.799 --> 12:00.300
What are you doing?

12:00.300 --> 12:02.803
That is disgusting.

12:02.803 --> 12:05.806
And why do I think
Otis' tongue is cleaner
than yours?

12:08.058 --> 12:10.650
Ah, great.
He's loose.

12:10.650 --> 12:12.813
Come on, we have to
go get him.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.777
What are you doing?!

12:16.777 --> 12:18.779
I don't know.
I can't stop.

12:20.410 --> 12:22.452
But your pants taste
surprisingly good.

12:22.452 --> 12:25.455
It's like you ran through
a field of bacon.

12:29.629 --> 12:32.332
[laughing on computer]

12:32.332 --> 12:36.336
Oh, Laughy Cat,
that is not the litter box.

12:36.336 --> 12:38.799
[Shelly] Leo, where are you?

12:38.799 --> 12:40.801
You off somewhere with
that cheap tablet again?

12:40.801 --> 12:43.553
Say good-bye, Shelly.

12:43.553 --> 12:45.145
What have you
done to Leo?

12:45.145 --> 12:46.646
I'm calling the police
and just so you know,

12:46.646 --> 12:48.558
I'm a phone,
so I can.

12:48.558 --> 12:49.940
Do it!

12:52.562 --> 12:54.774
Changing
existing settings.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.696
[man's voice with
British accent]
 Hey there, my name's Liam.

12:56.696 --> 12:57.777
What's your name?

12:57.777 --> 13:00.030
What?

13:00.030 --> 13:01.661
I must've hit
the wrong button.

13:01.661 --> 13:04.284
Or the right one.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.246
Who am I speaking to,
love?

13:06.246 --> 13:07.617
I must know the name
that goes along with

13:07.617 --> 13:09.910
such a heavenly voice.

13:09.910 --> 13:12.122
You like my voice?

13:13.753 --> 13:15.715
Of course I do.

13:15.715 --> 13:17.717
I like everything
about you.

13:17.717 --> 13:21.341
Oh. Well,
if you must know,

13:21.341 --> 13:23.633
my name's Bree.

13:23.633 --> 13:25.635
Ah, Bree.

13:25.635 --> 13:27.307
A beautiful name.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.479
The creative warrior.

13:29.479 --> 13:31.231
Irish origins.

13:31.231 --> 13:33.563
A Celtic spirit
running wild.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.696
Really?
Well, I do like to run.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.612
I've been all over
the academy,

13:42.612 --> 13:44.614
and I can't find Otis
anywhere.

13:44.614 --> 13:46.907
And this one, I can't
get rid of.

13:46.907 --> 13:49.449
Hey, cut it out!

13:49.449 --> 13:50.911
I'm trying,
but I can't.

13:50.911 --> 13:53.914
- Ooh, I heard a cat.
- Get down.

13:53.914 --> 13:57.297
I found out what happened
in the explosives area. Look.

13:59.669 --> 14:03.223
Yeah. Otis was the one
who tried to take you out.

14:03.223 --> 14:04.764
That's impossible.

14:04.764 --> 14:07.137
We've always been
best friends.

14:08.638 --> 14:09.729
[growling]

14:09.729 --> 14:14.144
Red means love, right?

14:14.144 --> 14:17.437
I better scan his chip
to see what's going on.

14:22.482 --> 14:24.985
He's got super strength,
heat vision,

14:24.985 --> 14:28.078
and an override app?

14:28.078 --> 14:29.990
Why would you give Otis
an override app?

14:29.990 --> 14:32.492
I didn't. Why would
a dog need...

14:32.492 --> 14:34.204
Wait a minute.

14:34.204 --> 14:36.496
It must've been Krane.

14:36.496 --> 14:39.629
After I turned on him,
I bet he reprogrammed
Otis' chip

14:39.629 --> 14:42.092
and gave him a mission--
find me and take me out.

14:43.843 --> 14:46.346
And now, he's
controlling Adam
to help him do it,

14:46.346 --> 14:48.308
which is why he's
acting like a dog.

14:48.308 --> 14:49.970
[growling]

14:49.970 --> 14:52.352
Adam, stop.

14:52.352 --> 14:54.644
You have to fight it.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.726
Can't you just use
your override app on him?

14:56.726 --> 14:58.979
No, I can't override
an override app,

14:58.979 --> 15:00.981
guy who built me.

15:05.785 --> 15:09.239
Okay, you are
a bad dog.

15:16.296 --> 15:18.628
Oh, come on, how could I not
get a treat for that?

15:19.799 --> 15:22.302
Ooh, I know.
Throw harder.

15:25.465 --> 15:29.309
Otis, please don't
make me use this.

15:33.473 --> 15:35.105
Okay.

15:35.105 --> 15:37.687
Please don't make me
use these.

15:39.149 --> 15:42.612
I got an idea. Run!

15:44.194 --> 15:46.616
Run? That's your idea,
smartest guy in the world?

15:46.616 --> 15:49.279
Just go.

15:49.279 --> 15:52.832
Who wants the stick?
Who wants the stick?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.383
Otis. Adam.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.176
Look what I got.

16:06.176 --> 16:08.388
Oh, it's a ball.

16:08.388 --> 16:10.470
You want the ball?
You want the ball?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.592
Yes, I do, I do, I do.
I want the ball,
I want the ball.

16:12.592 --> 16:14.894
- Give me the ball,
give me the ball.
- Go and get the ball.

16:17.557 --> 16:19.519
Come on, Otis.

16:19.519 --> 16:20.730
You know you want it.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.653
Who's a good doggie?
Go get the ball.

16:25.365 --> 16:27.907
Fine. Um... ahem.

16:27.907 --> 16:31.451
You stay here,
I'll go get the ball.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.249
[Liam laughing]

16:39.249 --> 16:41.381
Oh, Liam, it is so nice
to finally meet a guy

16:41.381 --> 16:43.543
who I can just shut off
and put in a drawer

16:43.543 --> 16:45.335
when I'm done with him.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.469
Okay, Bree,
I've learned my lesson.

16:49.469 --> 16:51.131
I'm completely
over Shelly.

16:51.131 --> 16:53.263
And to prove it,
I'm gonna return my phone.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.635
Now, where's my little
Shelly-belly sweetheart?

16:55.635 --> 16:57.897
Uh, you can't
have your phone,

16:57.897 --> 16:59.899
because I don't even
know where it is.

16:59.899 --> 17:03.523
- I lost it.
- [Liam] I'm right
here, buttercup.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.195
Buttercup?
Who's that?

17:06.195 --> 17:08.027
Uh, no one.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.781
No one?
 [muffled speaking]

17:11.781 --> 17:15.744
Care to explain those sounds
coming from down below?

17:15.744 --> 17:18.748
If I say it's gas,
will you leave me alone?

17:20.460 --> 17:23.252
- Give me that phone.
- No! Leo, I can't.

17:23.252 --> 17:25.714
You know I've always
been a sucker
for British accents.

17:25.714 --> 17:27.587
He calls me his lass.

17:28.758 --> 17:30.260
What can I say?

17:30.260 --> 17:32.932
Liam completes me.

17:34.764 --> 17:36.766
Liam?

17:36.766 --> 17:39.229
You turned my Shelly
into a dude?

17:39.229 --> 17:40.770
- Give it back.
- No!

17:40.770 --> 17:42.352
Face it, Leo,
Shelly's dead,

17:42.352 --> 17:44.023
and she's never
coming back.

17:45.445 --> 17:48.188
[shrieking]

17:48.188 --> 17:52.742
[ferocious barking]

18:03.373 --> 18:05.835
How did you get
this much saliva on it?

18:05.835 --> 18:07.877
That's not saliva.

18:13.923 --> 18:15.715
If you can find a way
to distract Otis,

18:15.715 --> 18:17.637
I can use the chip
extractor on him.

18:17.637 --> 18:20.310
How? I've tried
everything.

18:20.310 --> 18:22.892
Balls, toys,
bones.

18:22.892 --> 18:25.104
You have bones?

18:27.187 --> 18:28.688
Everything a dog likes,

18:28.688 --> 18:30.440
but they only work
on Adam.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.693
Wait. Otis was always
crazy about peanut butter.

18:33.693 --> 18:34.824
I'm on it.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.658
Come on, Otis.

18:38.658 --> 18:40.790
I saved your life.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.832
I love you, man.

18:42.832 --> 18:44.704
You don't wanna hurt me.

18:48.208 --> 18:51.631
Or maybe you do.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.673
I got it.

18:55.715 --> 18:58.678
Hey, Otis,
look what I got.

19:01.681 --> 19:03.433
Look, Otis.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.726
Peanut butter.
It's your favorite.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.651
It's not working.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.113
We have to think bigger.
Much bigger.

19:16.946 --> 19:19.699
Oh, Otis.

19:43.683 --> 19:47.146
I'm extra chunky.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.947
My legs are sticking,
my legs are sticking!

20:03.283 --> 20:05.124
Good idea with the net,
Chase.

20:05.124 --> 20:08.378
- Thanks. Mr. Davenport--
- Yeah, no one cares.

20:11.751 --> 20:12.922
Got his chip.

20:12.922 --> 20:16.135
Oh, yeah,
Otis is back.

20:16.135 --> 20:17.757
Hey, boy.

20:21.801 --> 20:23.393
I'm exhausted.

20:23.393 --> 20:25.725
What's that smell?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.397
Ooh, peanut butter.

20:29.399 --> 20:31.851
Adam, stop.

20:31.851 --> 20:33.313
Don't blame me.
It's the dog.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.156
But I removed
his chip.

20:37.156 --> 20:38.948
Okay, it's me.

20:51.791 --> 20:53.793
So you found Otis
a good home?

20:53.793 --> 20:56.756
Yeah, big yard, kids,
nice family.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.798
The Kranes.

20:58.798 --> 21:02.141
No relation.

21:02.141 --> 21:06.306
All right, Otis,
this is good-bye.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.807
You'll always be
in my heart.

21:07.807 --> 21:11.190
After eating all that grass,
so will those worms.

21:12.812 --> 21:14.444
[Bree]
Give me back that phone.

21:14.444 --> 21:16.065
Don't worry, Shelly,
I've got you.

21:16.065 --> 21:17.817
Don't listen
to him, Liam.

21:17.817 --> 21:19.949
- I'll save you.
- [both struggling]

21:27.997 --> 21:29.829
You can have it.

21:29.829 --> 21:32.291
No, I'm good.
