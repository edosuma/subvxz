00:02.569 --> 00:04.805
KYLE, WHEN I LOG OFF
FROM THE HANDYMAN WEBSITE

00:04.871 --> 00:07.440
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO FILL IN
THAT GROOVE YOU MAKING.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.242
OVERTON, MAN, IN A FEW MINUTES

00:09.309 --> 00:12.813
I'M GOING TO BE FACE‐TO‐FACE
WITH AN AUDITOR FROM THE I. R. S.

00:12.879 --> 00:15.516
LET ME WALK A FEW MORE
MOMENTS AS A FREE MAN.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.183
COME ON, MAN.
STOP TRIPPIN'.

00:17.250 --> 00:20.253
I MEAN, YOU GOT NOTHING
TO BE GUILTY OF...

00:20.320 --> 00:22.322
DO YOU?

00:22.388 --> 00:23.657
OF COURSE NOT, MAN

00:23.724 --> 00:26.760
BUT THE JAILS, THEY ARE
FULL OF INNOCENT MEN

00:26.827 --> 00:28.929
AND THE BIG, STRONG GUILTY MEN

00:28.995 --> 00:33.199
WHO TRADE THEM FOR CIGARETTES.

00:33.266 --> 00:34.568
HONESTLY, KYLE

00:34.635 --> 00:36.537
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY GOT ON YOU?

00:36.603 --> 00:38.605
OVERTON, LAST YEAR

00:38.672 --> 00:41.942
I DEDUCTED 596
BUSINESS LUNCHES, MAN.

00:42.008 --> 00:43.677
FIVE HUNDRED NINETY‐SIX?

00:43.744 --> 00:45.411
THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM

00:45.478 --> 00:49.015
UNLESS, OF COURSE, THE GUY KNOWS
ANYTHING ABOUT A <i>CALENDAR.</i>

00:49.082 --> 00:50.150
IT'S ALL LEGIT.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.785
I SET UP THREE
BUSINESS LUNCHES

00:51.852 --> 00:54.154
AT ONE RESTAURANT AND BY
THE TIME THEY'RE OVER

00:54.220 --> 00:56.289
I HAVE A FULL BELLY
AND A FAT COMMISSION.

00:56.356 --> 00:58.091
AW, MAN, JUST QUIT TRIPPIN'.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.400
I MEAN, HOW'S
SOME GOVERNMENT DRONE

01:00.466 --> 01:01.768
GOING TO COMPETE

01:01.835 --> 01:04.671
WITH A FINANCIAL WIZARD
LIKE YOURSELF?

01:04.738 --> 01:07.974
THAT'D BE LIKE ALFRED
KICKING BATMAN'S ASS.

01:08.041 --> 01:09.242
YOU KNOW, OVERTON

01:09.308 --> 01:11.077
THE IMAGE OF
THE I. R. S. AGENT

01:11.144 --> 01:13.647
AS A FEDERAL NERD IN
GLASSES IS A MYTH, MAN.

01:13.714 --> 01:15.415
YOU KNOW, THEY
NAILED CAPONE.

01:15.481 --> 01:16.583
( knocking )

01:16.650 --> 01:18.785
LOOK, THEY ARE HIT MEN
WITH CALCULATORS.

01:18.852 --> 01:19.920
I'M TELLING YOU.

01:22.288 --> 01:23.757

NOT TO TIP US OFF

02:12.012 --> 02:13.847
ABOUT THE KIND

02:13.914 --> 02:15.048
OKAY.

JUST CALL ME "POKER FACE."

MARY MARIE PLAZA.

02:35.368 --> 02:36.503
HEY!

02:36.570 --> 02:38.639
REGINE, MAX

02:38.705 --> 02:40.674
THIS IS MARY MARIE.

02:40.741 --> 02:42.342
( snotty tone ):
PLAZA.

02:42.408 --> 02:44.945
SHE DIRECTED THAT
"HOOCHIE HOEDOWN" VIDEO

02:45.011 --> 02:46.246
WE SAW LAST WEEK.

02:48.381 --> 02:52.553
CATCHY TUNE, BUT EVEN I WOULDN'T
MILK A COW IN A THONG, YOU KNOW.

02:52.619 --> 02:54.555
KHADIJAH, I'M HERE
TO THANK YOU.

02:54.621 --> 02:56.657
YOUR THOUGHT‐PROVOKING
INTERVIEW

02:56.723 --> 02:59.726
MADE ME REALIZE I COULDN'T
BRING MYSELF TO DIRECT

02:59.793 --> 03:01.768
ONE MORE FLESH‐PEDDLING VIDEO.

03:01.835 --> 03:03.704
OH, WHAT, YOU FOUND A NEW WAY

03:03.770 --> 03:07.641
TO SET BACK THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT
ANOTHER CENTURY?

03:07.708 --> 03:08.809
NO!

03:08.875 --> 03:10.343
I HAVE A NOBLER ASPIRATION.

03:10.410 --> 03:12.212
YOU'RE ALL INVITED
TO THE OPENING

03:12.278 --> 03:14.815
OF MY OFF‐OFF BROADWAY
DIRECTING DEBUT‐‐

03:14.881 --> 03:18.118
A REVIVAL
OF "THE CALLING HOURS."

03:18.184 --> 03:20.086
AN AMERICAN CLASSIC.

03:20.153 --> 03:22.122
ISN'T THAT PLAY
ABOUT A FUNERAL?

03:22.188 --> 03:24.290
IF I WANTED TO SPEND
AN HOUR AND A HALF

03:24.357 --> 03:27.427
WITH A DECAYING CORPSE,
I'D INVITE KYLE TO DINNER.

03:28.729 --> 03:30.296
YOU KNOW, I SAW
"THE CALLING HOURS"

03:30.363 --> 03:31.397
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

03:31.464 --> 03:33.399
MAN, THAT PLAY CHANGED MY LIFE.

03:33.466 --> 03:34.601
REALLY?

03:34.668 --> 03:35.836
MM‐HMM.

03:35.902 --> 03:38.371
I MEAN, FOR HOURS,
THOSE ACTRESSES WEPT

03:38.438 --> 03:40.507
WITHOUT ONE CASE
OF RACCOON EYES?

03:40.574 --> 03:44.711
HONEY, ON THAT DAY,
I DISCOVERED WATERPROOF MASCARA.

03:44.778 --> 03:46.112
( beeper beeping )

03:46.179 --> 03:47.714
MAY I USE YOUR PHONE?

03:47.781 --> 03:48.815
YEAH. KITCHEN.

03:48.882 --> 03:50.116
Synclaire:
WOW. "THE CALLING HOURS."

03:50.183 --> 03:53.119
I MUST HAVE DONE THAT PLAY
A HUNDRED TIMES.

03:53.186 --> 03:54.187
WHEN?

03:54.254 --> 03:56.389
AS AN USHER
AT THE YOUTH THEATER.

03:56.456 --> 03:59.926
YOU KNOW, TO THIS DAY, WHEN
I WALK ACROSS A STICKY FLOOR

03:59.993 --> 04:02.102
I GET MISTY.

04:02.168 --> 04:03.870
STAY OUT OF PUBLIC
REST ROOMS

04:03.937 --> 04:05.772
AND MAX'S KITCHEN

04:05.839 --> 04:07.641
AND YOU BE ALL RIGHT.

04:09.209 --> 04:12.145
MAYBE MARY MARIE
NEEDS AN UNDERSTUDY.

04:12.212 --> 04:14.948
OKAY, I GOT TO GET
MY HEADSHOT, MY RESUME

04:15.015 --> 04:16.216
MY DEMO TAPE...

04:16.281 --> 04:17.784
YOU DON'T HAVE
A DEMO TAPE.

04:17.851 --> 04:19.084
GOOD POINT.

04:19.152 --> 04:20.587
MAX, YOU GET THE CAMCORDER.

04:20.654 --> 04:23.423
KHADIJAH, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY "ANNIE" WIG?

04:23.489 --> 04:25.258
UH... NOW, HOLD UP, HOLD UP.

04:25.325 --> 04:27.528
LOOK, YOU NOT GOING
TO SCORE POINTS

04:27.594 --> 04:29.863
BY BEING YOUR USUAL,
OVEREAGER SELF.

04:29.930 --> 04:32.132
NAME ONE TIME
WHEN I WAS OVEREAGER.

04:32.198 --> 04:34.100
WHEN YOU TACKLED
JAMES EARL JONES

04:34.167 --> 04:35.669
OUTSIDE LINCOLN CENTER.

04:35.735 --> 04:38.872
HE WAS RUNNING
A LITTLE TOO FAST.

04:38.938 --> 04:41.074
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

04:41.141 --> 04:43.309
THE ACTRESS I CAST
AS SHIRLEEN JUST UP AND QUIT.

04:43.376 --> 04:46.613
SHE GOT A ROLE IN <i>SHOWGIRLS:</i>
<i>PART II, SHOW MORE.</i>

04:48.114 --> 04:49.683
SO YOU NEED
ANOTHER ACTRESS

04:49.750 --> 04:51.484
WHO KNOWS ALL THE LINES

04:51.552 --> 04:53.720
AND COULD GET
OUT OF HER JOB

04:53.787 --> 04:56.022
AS A RECEPTIONIST
LIKE THAT.

04:57.390 --> 05:00.493
( muttering ):
SYNCLAIRE, YOU TELL HER
YOU WANT THAT PART

05:00.561 --> 05:03.269
BEFORE I SLAP
THE HELL OUT OF YOU.

05:03.336 --> 05:05.171
MARY, MARY,
I'M AN ACTRESS

05:05.238 --> 05:08.041
AND I KNOW THAT PART.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.176
MARY <i>MARIE!</i>

05:10.243 --> 05:13.580
( <i>mimics snotty voice</i> ):
<i>PLAZA.</i>

05:13.647 --> 05:15.916
THANK YOU.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.384
DO YOU REALLY KNOW
THE ROLE OF SHIRLEEN?

05:18.451 --> 05:20.086
OH! OH! OH!
I KNOW EVERY LINE!

05:20.153 --> 05:21.888
PLUS, I COULD
HAND OUT PROGRAMS

05:21.955 --> 05:23.056
PARK THE CARS

05:23.123 --> 05:24.758
AND SCRAPE THE GUM
OFF A SEAT

05:24.825 --> 05:26.226
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

05:26.292 --> 05:28.394
THIS IS <i>KISMET!</i>

05:28.461 --> 05:31.532
KHADIJAH'S ARTICLE FREES ME
FROM MY SELF‐IMPOSED MISERY

05:31.598 --> 05:34.735
AND KHADIJAH'S COUSIN
DRIVES ME TOWARD MY GOAL!

05:34.801 --> 05:37.003
COME, COME WITH MARY
MARIE PLAZA RIGHT NOW.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.539
WE HAVE TO START
REHEARSAL.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.706
YES, OF COURSE.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.107
OH, THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.909
I'M FULFILLING
A DREAM I'VE HAD

05:42.976 --> 05:44.110
SINCE I WAS 16.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.579
SIXTEEN, HUH?

05:45.646 --> 05:50.016
UNTIL THEN, SHE WANTED TO BE
ONE OF SANTA'S HELPERS.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.086
UH‐HUH.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.088
OH!

05:55.155 --> 05:57.023
UH‐HUH.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.158
<i>UH‐HUH.</i>

05:58.224 --> 06:00.493
WHAT? WHAT?

06:00.561 --> 06:02.102
MR. BARKER, IN MY SEVEN
YEARS AT THE I. R. S.

06:02.168 --> 06:04.104
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

06:04.170 --> 06:05.205
WAIT, I ASSURE YOU

06:05.271 --> 06:07.173
I DIDN'T DEDUCT
ANY OF THOSE ITEMS.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.408
OH, NO, NO.

06:08.474 --> 06:09.576
( snorting laugh )

06:09.643 --> 06:11.244
NO, I WAS ADMIRING.

06:11.311 --> 06:13.914
IN A SINGLE DAY,
YOU PURCHASED

06:13.980 --> 06:16.650
AN ARABIAN SILK CAMISOLE,
DINNER AT JEZEBEL'S

06:16.717 --> 06:18.719
AND A NIGHTCAP
AT THE FOUR SEASONS

06:18.785 --> 06:21.354
WHERE YOU RESERVED
THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE?

06:21.421 --> 06:23.389
AH, YES, TRINITY NIGHT.

06:23.456 --> 06:25.391
IT INVOLVED
THREE DIFFERENT WOMEN

06:25.458 --> 06:28.094
AND THE EXPERIENCE
WAS <i>DEFINITELY RELIGIOUS.</i>

06:28.161 --> 06:30.196
( chuckling )

06:30.263 --> 06:31.798
THREE WOMEN
IN ONE DAY.

06:31.865 --> 06:32.899
YEAH.

06:32.966 --> 06:34.735
IF I HAD ONE‐THIRD
OF YOUR SUCCESS...

06:34.801 --> 06:36.603
STOP TORTURING
YOURSELF, DIPPLE.

06:36.670 --> 06:38.739
OKAY.

06:40.774 --> 06:42.075
( dry chuckle )

06:42.142 --> 06:44.177
I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING

06:44.244 --> 06:46.012
YOU'RE NOT A MAGNET
FOR THE LADIES.

06:46.079 --> 06:47.113
CAN I CONFIDE

06:47.180 --> 06:49.315
IN YOU?

06:49.382 --> 06:50.216
ONLY IF I CAN LEAF
THROUGH A MAGAZINE

06:50.283 --> 06:51.217
WHILE YOU DO IT.

06:51.284 --> 06:53.086
THERE IS A WAITRESS
NAMED MONA

06:53.153 --> 06:54.555
AT THE FEDERAL BUILDING

06:54.621 --> 06:57.357
AND EVERY TIME I GO IN
FOR COFFEE, I ASK HER OUT

06:57.423 --> 07:00.326
AND SHE PLOPS DOWN A BEARCLAW
AND TURNS HER BACK ON ME

07:00.393 --> 07:03.504
AND WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BACK IT IS.

07:03.570 --> 07:07.273
OKAY, WELL, EXACTLY WHAT AMOROUS
OVERTURES HAVE YOU EMPLOYED?

07:07.340 --> 07:08.441
OH.

07:08.509 --> 07:11.211
WELL, I‐I‐I USUALLY SAY
SOMETHING LIKE

07:11.277 --> 07:13.279
"I BET YOU'RE A SHORT‐FORM USER.

07:13.346 --> 07:16.583
WANT TO KNOW HOW I CAN TELL?"

07:17.618 --> 07:19.653
AND SHE DIDN'T RESPOND TO THAT?

07:21.187 --> 07:23.456
ALL RIGHT, THEN, CHECK IT OUT.

07:23.524 --> 07:25.626
LOOK, NEXT TIME,
JUST ORDER A DANISH INSTEAD.

07:25.692 --> 07:28.461
SHE'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE
"WHAT, NO BEARCLAW TODAY?"

07:28.529 --> 07:30.997
YOU COUNTER WITH,
"YOU GET PRETTIER EVERY DAY.

07:31.064 --> 07:34.100
DON'T I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO CHANGE?"

07:34.167 --> 07:36.537
OH, GOOD LORD,
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

07:36.603 --> 07:38.071
YEAH, THANK YOU.

07:40.306 --> 07:41.842
IF YOU WERE MY CYRANO

07:41.908 --> 07:45.111
I WOULD HAVE MONA EATING
BEARCLAW OUT OF MY HAND.

07:45.178 --> 07:47.614
GET YOUR COAT!
IT'S PASTRY TIME.

07:47.681 --> 07:51.518
AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME
TO SAY THIS, DIPPLE

07:51.585 --> 07:52.786
<i>NO.</i>

07:53.754 --> 07:56.322
MR. BARKER, THERE ARE
TWO KINDS OF AUDITS.

07:56.389 --> 07:58.659
ONE IS THE STANDARD LOOK‐SEE

07:58.725 --> 08:02.836
AND THE OTHER IS
THE DEEP‐TISSUE MASSAGE.

08:02.903 --> 08:06.039
YOU WANT ME IN YOUR LIFE
FOR A FEW DAYS OR A FEW MONTHS?

08:08.041 --> 08:10.611
THIS IS UNADULTERATED EXTORTION.

08:10.677 --> 08:12.913
I FEEL MORE VIRILE ALREADY.

08:16.583 --> 08:20.386
BEHOLD MY NEW CREATION.

08:20.453 --> 08:21.788
Regine:
WOW!

08:21.855 --> 08:23.824
OBIE, THE BASEBALL CAP.

08:23.890 --> 08:26.159
YOU BETTER RUN DOWN
TO THE PATENT OFFICE

08:26.226 --> 08:29.696
BEFORE 1896.

08:29.763 --> 08:32.866
EXCUSE ME,
LITTLE CHIEF RUNNING MOUTH.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.937
THIS HERE IS THE OBIE‐CAM

08:37.003 --> 08:41.875
A MINIATURE CAMERA DISGUISED
AS AN ATHLETIC CHAPEAU.

08:43.710 --> 08:45.311
I'M GOING TO USE IT TO TAPE

08:45.378 --> 08:47.648
MY BABY'S
FIRST STAGE PERFORMANCE...

08:47.714 --> 08:50.183
WITH HER CLOTHES ON, OF COURSE.

08:50.250 --> 08:53.353
OVERTON, THAT THING
IS RIDICULOUS.

08:53.419 --> 08:54.821
RIDICULOUS, YOU SAY?

08:54.888 --> 08:55.756
I SAY.

08:55.822 --> 08:57.891
I LAUGH IN YOUR FACE‐‐ HA HA!

08:59.459 --> 09:00.734
LET'S TRY IT OUT, THEN.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.435
COME ON.

09:04.470 --> 09:05.939
HOW'S THIS?

09:06.006 --> 09:09.075
MMM, UH, BACK UP
A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

09:10.944 --> 09:12.112
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.849
NAH. JUST‐JUST KEEP IT GOING.

09:17.951 --> 09:19.920
( Khadijah and Overton laugh )

09:19.986 --> 09:21.321
( sighing )

09:21.387 --> 09:24.457
HEY, MARY MARIE PLAZA,
SYNCLAIRE.

09:24.525 --> 09:26.459
HEY, BABY, HOW'S
MY DAMSEL OF DRAMA?

09:26.527 --> 09:28.494
OH, I FEEL,
I FEEL JAZZED, YOU KNOW?

09:28.562 --> 09:31.331
I FEEL SO CONNECTED
TO THAT CHARACTER OF SHIRLEEN

09:31.397 --> 09:33.366
LIKE RIGHT NOW,
SHE'S VERY TIRED.

09:33.433 --> 09:35.135
GOOD NIGHT.

09:36.937 --> 09:39.540
WELL, I GUESS WHEN MY BABY
ACCEPTS HER TONY AWARD

09:39.606 --> 09:41.508
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST
ONE SHE THANKS

09:41.575 --> 09:43.176
I MEAN, AFTER ME,
OF COURSE.

09:43.243 --> 09:45.846
WHERE IS YOUR LIQUOR CABINET?

09:45.912 --> 09:49.049
OKAY, YOU CAN BE THE FIRST!

09:49.115 --> 09:54.120
THAT WOMAN IS QUITE POSSIBLY
THE WORST ACTRESS ON THE PLANET.

09:54.187 --> 09:56.322
HEY, COME ON, NOW.

09:56.389 --> 09:57.524
SHE'S ONLY HAD
ONE DAY OF REHEARSAL.

09:57.591 --> 09:59.626
LOOK, I'M SURE AFTER
SHE AND HER CHARACTER

09:59.693 --> 10:01.568
GET A LITTLE NAP,
THEY'LL COME AROUND.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.670
I HAVE WORKED
WITH VIDEO DANCERS

10:03.737 --> 10:05.739
WHO SAT IN VATS
OF GREEN JELL‐O

10:05.806 --> 10:09.910
SQUEALING "OH, THE GREEN.
IT CHILLS ME."

10:09.976 --> 10:14.480
THEY WERE OLIVIER
COMPARED TO HER.

10:14.548 --> 10:16.650
OH, NO, NO, NO.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.784
SEE, MY BABY'S
A TOP‐NOTCH ACTRESS

10:17.851 --> 10:19.986
AND IF YOU CAN'T
BRING THAT OUT IN HER

10:20.053 --> 10:23.557
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO GET ONE
OF THEM LITTLE JELL‐O JIGGLERS.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.691
I CAN'T.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.392
THE PLAY OPENS TOMORROW NIGHT

10:26.459 --> 10:27.928
AND BY THE END OF THE SHOW

10:27.994 --> 10:29.930
THERE'LL BE
TWO MORE COFFINS ON STAGE‐‐

10:29.996 --> 10:32.398
ONE
FOR MARY MARIE PLAZA'S CAREER

10:32.465 --> 10:35.802
AND ONE OF THE CAREER
OF SYNCLAIRE JAMES.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.672
( slams door )

10:38.739 --> 10:40.040
NOW, SEE THERE.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.709
THAT LADY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT SHE TALKING 'BOUT.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.445
SYNCLAIRE AND I
ARE GOING TO GET CREMATED.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.154
TWO QUESTIONS:
WHO IS GOING TO LOWER

10:54.220 --> 10:56.723
THE BOOM ON SYNCLAIRE,
AND WHERE'S THE JELLY?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.525
WHY DO WE HAVE
TO TELL SYNCLAIRE

10:58.592 --> 11:00.527
THAT HER DIRECTOR
THINKS SHE STINKS?

11:00.594 --> 11:02.468
MAYBE SHE'LL GO
OUT THERE TONIGHT

11:02.536 --> 11:03.770
AND SURPRISE EVERYBODY.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.239
SHE'S ALWAYS HAD A ANGEL
ON HER SHOULDER.

11:06.306 --> 11:09.009
YEAH, THAT ANGEL'S GOING
TO TAKE OFF FOR THE RAFTERS

11:09.075 --> 11:10.777
ONCE THE TOMATOES
START FLYING.

11:11.044 --> 11:14.648
NO, KHADIJAH, I CAN'T LET GIRLIE
GO OUT THERE UNPROTECTED.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.282
THAT'D BE LIKE A MECHANIC

11:16.349 --> 11:18.484
SENDING YOU OFF
WITH FAULTY BRAKES.

11:18.552 --> 11:21.254
SURE, YOU MIGHT MAKE IT HOME,
BUT THEN AGAIN

11:21.321 --> 11:24.525
THEY MIGHT HAVE TO SCRAPE
YOUR ASS OFF A BILLBOARD.

11:24.591 --> 11:25.892
WHAT YOU THINK, MAX?

11:25.959 --> 11:28.328
UH, NO,
I CAN'T ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

11:28.394 --> 11:30.263
I... WHERE'S THE JELLY, MAN?

11:31.297 --> 11:34.434
WELL, OVERTON, IF YOU INSIST
ON TELLING SYNCLAIRE

11:34.500 --> 11:36.336
AT LEAST SWEETEN
IT A LITTLE.

11:36.402 --> 11:38.705
YOU KNOW HOW SENSITIVE
SYNCLAIRE IS.

11:38.772 --> 11:41.107
INSTEAD OF
KILLING FLIES

11:41.174 --> 11:43.544
SHE TRIES TO TALK THEM
INTO LIVING SOMEPLACE ELSE.

11:43.610 --> 11:44.811
MORNING, EVERYBODY.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.446
GOOD MORNING,
SYNCLAIRE.

11:46.513 --> 11:47.814
OR IS IT SHIRLEEN?

11:47.881 --> 11:51.117
YOU'RE SO GOOD, GIRL, I
CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

11:51.184 --> 11:53.620
MARY MARIE PLAZA
THINKS YOU STINK.

11:53.687 --> 11:57.023
( laughing )

11:57.090 --> 11:58.892
WOULD SOMEBODY
PLEASE TELL ME

11:58.959 --> 12:01.134
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:01.201 --> 12:04.470
WELL, HONEY,
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND...

12:04.538 --> 12:06.707
SHE THINKS YOU STINK.

12:06.773 --> 12:08.341
IMPOSSIBLE.

12:08.408 --> 12:10.611
SHE WAS THRILLED
WITH ME YESTERDAY.

12:10.677 --> 12:12.378
SHE WAS JUMPING UP AND DOWN

12:12.445 --> 12:14.748
SAYING, "MY GOD,
HOW CAN THIS BE?!"

12:16.482 --> 12:17.951
OH. OH.

12:19.686 --> 12:22.055
OH, WAIT, NOW.

12:22.122 --> 12:26.092
I GUESS, UH, THERE'S ANOTHER WAY
YOU COULD TAKE THAT.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.428
SORRY, BABY.

12:28.494 --> 12:30.363
SHE HATES ME.

12:30.430 --> 12:32.699
SHE REALLY HATES ME.

12:32.766 --> 12:34.300
OH, OKAY,
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK

12:34.367 --> 12:37.538
I‐I‐I CAN TELL HER THERE'S
AN EMERGENCY AT THE OFFICE

12:37.604 --> 12:40.206
AND YOU CAN'T
DO THE PLAY.

12:40.273 --> 12:43.009
YEAH, AND I COULD RIG THE WIRING
TO SHORT OUT A WHOLE CITY BLOCK.

12:43.076 --> 12:45.245
THAT WAY,
PEOPLE'D BE TOO BUSY LOOTING

12:45.311 --> 12:47.047
TO GIVE A DAMN ABOUT A PLAY.

12:48.949 --> 12:53.554
OH... I APPRECIATE
EVERYONE'S CONCERN

12:53.620 --> 12:56.122
BUT THE FIRST RULE
OF THE THEATER

12:56.189 --> 12:57.891
IS THE SHOW MUST GO ON.

12:57.958 --> 12:59.626
TONIGHT, I WILL PROVE

12:59.693 --> 13:02.669
THAT SYNCLAIRE JAMES
HAS GOT THE GOODS.

13:02.736 --> 13:04.370
I SHALL... PERSEVERE.

13:05.739 --> 13:07.508
WORK THE CROWD.

13:07.574 --> 13:09.543
YOU WORK
THE CROWD, BABY.

13:10.744 --> 13:12.445
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME

13:12.513 --> 13:16.182
SHIRLEEN AND I ARE GOING
TO GO AND TAKE A SHOWER.

13:18.752 --> 13:20.954
IS IT JUST ME

13:21.021 --> 13:23.356
OR DOES THAT THOUGHT
TURN ANYBODY ELSE ON?

13:29.596 --> 13:31.865
( knock at door )

13:36.169 --> 13:38.839
HI‐DEE‐HO,
MACK MAESTRO.

13:41.041 --> 13:44.210
IT'S THE CAB CALLOWAY
OF THE GEEKS.

13:44.277 --> 13:47.714
THANKS TO YOU, MONA AND I
HAD A GRAND OLD TIME‐‐

13:47.781 --> 13:50.450
DINNER, DANCING,
AND JUST BEFORE DAWN

13:50.517 --> 13:52.052
WE WENT ALL THE WAY.

13:52.118 --> 13:53.219
AH...

13:53.286 --> 13:54.921
SHE KISSED ME
SQUARE ON THE CHEEK

13:54.988 --> 13:57.490
AND IT WASN'T JUST A
LITTLE FRIENDLY PECK EITHER.

13:57.558 --> 13:59.893
SHE LINGERED THERE FOR
AT LEAST HALF A SECOND.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.234
CONGRATULATIONS.

14:01.301 --> 14:03.737
WITH A LITTLE PERSEVERANCE,
A NEW HAIRCUT, AND...

14:03.804 --> 14:05.071
( sniffing )

14:05.138 --> 14:07.674
A LITTLE LESS COLOGNE,
I SEE A HUG IN YOUR FUTURE.

14:07.741 --> 14:08.742
NOW, CAN YOU LEAVE?

14:08.809 --> 14:10.677
BUT DON'T YOU
WANT TO TAKE A PEEK

14:10.744 --> 14:12.412
AT THE RESULTS
OF YOUR AUDIT?

14:12.478 --> 14:13.880
YO, I'M GETTING A REFUND?

14:13.947 --> 14:16.082
CHECK COULD BE IN
THE MAIL ON MONDAY.

14:16.149 --> 14:17.651
( laughing )

14:17.718 --> 14:18.819
( laughing )

14:18.885 --> 14:20.386
( both laughing )

14:20.453 --> 14:23.223
SO, WE BOTH BENEFITTED
FROM OUR BRIEF ASSOCIATION.

14:23.289 --> 14:25.859
NOW, YOU CAN LEAVE
WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO FEEL

14:25.926 --> 14:28.629
THAT WE EVER HAVE TO TALK
TO ONE ANOTHER AGAIN.

14:28.695 --> 14:30.063
OKAY? BYE‐BYE.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.533
LAST NIGHT,
WHEN I WAS OUT ON THE TOWN

14:32.599 --> 14:33.934
I REALIZED SOMETHING.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.903
THERE IS A BEVY
OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN OUT THERE.

14:36.970 --> 14:39.773
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
SHORT‐ORDER GODDESS, MONA?

14:39.840 --> 14:42.876
MONA? ONE NIGHT IN YOUR WORLD
MADE ME REALIZE I CAN DO BETTER

14:42.943 --> 14:44.945
THAN A WOMAN
THAT SMELLS LIKE KETCHUP.

14:46.312 --> 14:47.948
COME ON, KYLE.

14:48.014 --> 14:51.852
SHOW ME THE HIVE
WHERE THE HONEYBEES HANG.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.722
CLEARLY YOU ARE
UNDER THE DELUSION

14:55.789 --> 14:57.524
THAT I WOULD GO
ANYWHERE WITH YOU

14:57.591 --> 14:59.092
WITHOUT THREAT
OF EXTORTION.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.193
OH, NO, NO, NO.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.568
I'M NOT THAT
CONFIDENT YET.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.003
I'VE TAKEN CARE
OF LAST YEAR

15:03.069 --> 15:04.538
BUT EVERY TAX YEAR
BEFORE THAT

15:04.605 --> 15:06.306
MIGHT NEED A LITTLE
MORE SCRUTINY.

15:06.372 --> 15:09.309
DIPPLE, YOU CANNOT USE YOUR
POSITION TO THREATEN ME, MAN.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.811
KYLE, I'M WITH THE I. R. S.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.979
I'LL GET MY COAT.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.548
MMM.

15:14.615 --> 15:16.382
WELL, CUZ

15:16.449 --> 15:17.984
BREAK A LEG.

15:18.051 --> 15:21.154
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO DO THAT ALL DAY.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.289
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
I'M GOING OUT THERE

15:23.356 --> 15:24.925
AND MAKE A FOOL
OUT OF MYSELF.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.660
WHAT ABOUT
"THE SHOW MUST GO ON"?

15:26.727 --> 15:28.562
WHAT ABOUT
THE TRADITION OF THEATER?

15:28.629 --> 15:30.330
WHAT ABOUT
THE BACK DOOR?

15:30.396 --> 15:31.698
I'M GETTING UP OUT.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.567
NO, NO, NOW.

15:33.634 --> 15:36.002
SYNCLAIRE, AS CORNY
AS YOUR LITTLE SPEECH

15:36.069 --> 15:38.171
IN THE KITCHEN WAS,
WE ALL BOUGHT IT.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.006
NOW, IF YOU
CAN ACT WELL ENOUGH

15:40.073 --> 15:41.808
TO FOOL
THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU

15:41.875 --> 15:43.276
YOU SHOULD HAVE
NO PROBLEM

15:43.343 --> 15:45.278
FOOLING A CROWD
FULL OF STRANGERS.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.813
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?

15:46.880 --> 15:48.081
I GOT TO GO.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.851
GOOD LUCK.

15:57.758 --> 15:58.825
I DIDN'T SEE

15:58.892 --> 16:00.460
A CONCESSION
STAND OUT THERE.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.669
YEAH, THAT'S WHY I WENT
TO THE 7‐ELEVEN.

16:02.736 --> 16:03.737
BIT‐O‐HONEY?

16:03.804 --> 16:04.905
MMM, COME ON WITH IT.

16:07.708 --> 16:10.310
( slow music
in a minor key playing )

16:13.614 --> 16:16.049
I CRIED WIDOW'S TEARS, BRIAN.

16:16.116 --> 16:19.185
I HAD ALL THE MOURNERS
BELIEVING ME.

16:19.252 --> 16:20.721
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD

16:20.787 --> 16:23.423
BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE
THESE FEW MOMENTS ALONE

16:23.489 --> 16:25.726
I CAN TELL YOU
JUST HOW GLAD I AM...

16:25.792 --> 16:28.361
YOU'RE DEAD.

16:39.506 --> 16:41.074
( audience laughing )

16:43.243 --> 16:44.778
HELLO, MOTHER.

16:44.845 --> 16:46.312
COME IN, SHIRLEEN.

16:46.379 --> 16:48.348
CLOSE THE DOOR.

17:00.967 --> 17:02.335
( laughing )

17:02.402 --> 17:05.438
OH, I'M... UH,
WOO‐WOO‐WOO.

17:05.506 --> 17:07.007
( laughing )

17:08.675 --> 17:09.976
WOO‐WOO‐WOO?

17:10.042 --> 17:11.176
( laughing )

17:11.243 --> 17:14.446
WOO... WOO‐WOO?

17:14.515 --> 17:15.915
( laughing )

17:15.982 --> 17:18.919
ALL THE LADIES IN THE HOUSE
GO ♪ WHOO! ♪

17:22.522 --> 17:26.126
LET'S SEE IF HE'S REALLY DEAD
BEFORE HE TAKES HIS DIRT NAP.

17:30.664 --> 17:32.265
I KNOW
YOU'RE GRIEVING, DEAR

17:32.332 --> 17:34.801
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE
HE'S IN A BETTER PLACE.

17:34.868 --> 17:36.937
WHAT, OFF‐OFF BROADWAY
AT HIS AGE?

17:37.003 --> 17:39.039
PLAYING THE UKELELE
IN THE SUBWAY

17:39.105 --> 17:40.574
WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE.

17:40.641 --> 17:41.808
( laughing )

17:41.875 --> 17:43.309
OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH!

17:43.376 --> 17:45.211
( laughing )

17:45.278 --> 17:47.514
HEY, I CAN'T
BREATHE IN HERE!

17:47.581 --> 17:50.016
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BREATHE.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.151
YOU'RE DEAD.

17:51.217 --> 17:52.719
DECOMPOSE YOURSELF.

17:52.786 --> 17:54.454
( laughing )

18:00.160 --> 18:02.202
SO, HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW?

18:02.268 --> 18:03.937
S'ALL RIGHT!

18:06.573 --> 18:09.042
STOP IT! YOU'RE KILLING ME!

18:09.109 --> 18:10.376
WELL, THEN, HOP ON IN.

18:10.443 --> 18:11.778
THERE'S ROOM FOR TWO.

18:13.146 --> 18:14.681
FREAKY.

18:17.217 --> 18:18.685
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW

18:18.752 --> 18:22.055
I COULD BORE ALL OF YOU PEOPLE
WITH A LONG SOLILOQUY

18:22.122 --> 18:24.958
ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH
AND MISERY AND SUFFERING

18:25.025 --> 18:26.860
BUT, HEY, YOU'VE GOT TO WALK

18:26.927 --> 18:29.162
THE STREETS
OF NEW YORK SOON, SO...

18:30.864 --> 18:32.432
GOOD‐BYE, PAPA.

18:32.498 --> 18:35.268
GIVE ST. PETER A NOOGIE FOR ME.

18:35.335 --> 18:36.570
NOOGIES!

18:36.637 --> 18:38.038
YOU'VE BEEN GREAT.

18:38.104 --> 18:40.106
GOOD NIGHT.
DEAD MAN ROLLING.

18:40.173 --> 18:42.809
( cheering )

18:42.876 --> 18:43.977
GOOD NIGHT.

18:44.044 --> 18:45.278
OH, I LOVE YOU.

18:49.015 --> 18:50.717
BABY, YOU REALLY
WOWED THEM.

18:50.784 --> 18:54.354
I LAUGHED, I CRIED, AND WHEN
YOU LIMBOED UNDER THE COFFIN

18:54.420 --> 18:56.657
I DAMN NEAR DIED.

18:56.723 --> 19:00.493
OH, OVERTON, I HAD A REVELATION
ON THAT STAGE TONIGHT.

19:00.561 --> 19:02.235
I CAN'T MAKE PEOPLE SAD.

19:02.302 --> 19:05.806
LAUGHTER IS THE GIFT
I'M GOING TO GIVE THE WORLD.

19:05.872 --> 19:07.708
WELL, ON BEHALF
OF THE WORLD

19:07.774 --> 19:10.043
I'D LIKE TO THANK
YOU WITH A KISS.

19:10.110 --> 19:11.878
THANK YOU.

19:11.945 --> 19:14.648
AND, UH, I GOT ANOTHER
KIND OF THANK YOU

19:14.715 --> 19:18.118
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
GIVE YOU THAT PERSONALLY.

19:18.184 --> 19:20.186
( doorbell rings )

19:27.628 --> 19:28.695
LOOK HERE, WOMAN

19:28.762 --> 19:31.031
DON'T START NONE,
WON'T BE NONE.

19:32.265 --> 19:34.234
I ADMIT
I WAS IN QUITE A STATE

19:34.300 --> 19:36.637
WHEN I GOT HOME,
BUT AS I WAS ABOUT

19:36.703 --> 19:39.105
TO DIVE OFF THE LEDGE,
THE PHONE RANG

19:39.172 --> 19:42.709
AND IT DIDN'T STOP RINGING
UNTIL MY ANSWERING MACHINE

19:42.776 --> 19:45.612
WAS FILLED WITH KUDOS
AND TICKET REQUESTS.

19:45.679 --> 19:47.247
TO SEE ME?

19:47.313 --> 19:49.082
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

19:49.149 --> 19:51.151
EVEN SHIRLEEN
IS SPEECHLESS.

19:51.217 --> 19:53.820
CHECK OUT WHAT I DID
AT THE 24‐HOUR PRINTERS.

19:53.887 --> 19:56.857
"A FUNNY THING HAPPENED
ON THE WAY TO THE FUNERAL"

19:56.923 --> 19:59.392
DIRECTED BY
MARY MARIE PLAZA

19:59.459 --> 20:01.635
STARRING SYNCLAIRE JAMES.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.203
I WANT YOU
TO STAY IN THE SHOW

20:03.269 --> 20:05.672
AND CONTINUE TO MAKE
A MOCKERY OF THE SCRIPT.

20:05.739 --> 20:07.140
I DON'T KNOW.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.308
I‐I, I'D LOVE TO

20:08.374 --> 20:10.911
BUT EVERYTHING I
DID WAS AD‐LIBBED.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.913
I DON'T REMEMBER
ANY OF IT.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.915
NEVER FEAR,
MY VIDEO VIXEN.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.416
IT'S ALL IN THE HAT.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.018
OH..!

20:18.084 --> 20:19.753
THIS IS
POSITIVELY KARMIC.

20:19.820 --> 20:22.188
SYNCLAIRE JAMES
IS GOING TO BE A STAR

20:22.255 --> 20:23.757
AND MARY MARIE PLAZA'S

20:23.824 --> 20:26.660
FINALLY GOING
TO GET OFF ANTI‐DEPRESSANTS.

20:28.862 --> 20:33.299
SO, OBIE, HOW MUCH MORE TIME
DO WE HAVE LEFT ON THE TAPE?

20:33.366 --> 20:35.869
I GUESS WE GOT
ABOUT 58 MINUTES.

20:35.936 --> 20:37.671
WHY DO YOU ASK?

20:37.738 --> 20:42.008
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
THAT YOU AUDITIONED FOR ME.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.478
OH, MY.

20:45.546 --> 20:46.913
GET ON UP THE
STAIRS, DADDY.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.048
GET ON UP THE STAIRS.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.182
( laughing )

20:49.249 --> 20:52.152
<i>WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.</i>

20:59.560 --> 21:00.534
OH, UH, UH, UH...

21:00.601 --> 21:01.668
NO, KYLE, WAIT.

21:01.735 --> 21:03.504
I JUST WANTED TO
RETURN YOUR RECEIPTS.

21:03.570 --> 21:05.271
WELL, JUST DROP THEM
ON THE FLOOR

21:05.338 --> 21:06.472
AND BACK AWAY SLOWLY.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.074
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.710
I FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY

21:09.776 --> 21:12.412
THAT MY NEW‐FOUND POWER
HAS A DOWN SIDE.

21:12.478 --> 21:14.247
I RAN INTO THE WRONG WOMAN.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.816
AN EVIL WOMAN.

21:15.882 --> 21:17.250
A HARPY.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.384
A HELLION.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.521
EVIL? HARPY? HELLION?

21:20.587 --> 21:22.656
IS THIS A LOCAL GIRL?

21:22.723 --> 21:24.424
SHE LIVES RIGHT
ACROSS THE STREET.

21:24.490 --> 21:26.059
IN FACT, I BETTER GET GOING.

21:26.126 --> 21:29.362
I JUST LEFT HER A NOTE ON
HER DOOR BREAKING OUR DATE.

21:29.429 --> 21:32.633
Max:
DIPPLE, I KNOW YOU'RE
STILL AROUND HERE!

21:32.699 --> 21:34.835
I SEE YOUR
GOVERNMENT PLATES!

21:34.901 --> 21:36.937
RUN, MAN,
RUN LIKE THE WIND.
