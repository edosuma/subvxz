01:23.761 --> 01:25.200
'It's a comic?'

01:25.201 --> 01:27.480
No, it's a graphic novel.

01:27.481 --> 01:29.800
It's called Utopia Experiments.

01:29.801 --> 01:33.240
You had this. Where is it?

01:33.241 --> 01:35.720
It's just one of those conspiracy
theories.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.660
- What about Utopia, then?
- Tell him, Becky.

01:37.746 --> 01:41.745
Utopia Part Two, there must be
something in it that they want.

01:42.386 --> 01:43.745
I also live with my mum.

01:43.746 --> 01:47.065
Jesus Christ! You're going
to make me cry now, Ian.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.265
I'm mission?

01:48.266 --> 01:50.225
You should persuade him to take it.

01:50.226 --> 01:54.225
What about the vaccine? Russian flu.
I think we could reconsider.

01:54.786 --> 01:56.025
He signed.

01:56.026 --> 01:57.505
He's fucking resigning, Michael.

01:57.506 --> 02:01.305
My mate's going to ask you
a question.

02:01.306 --> 02:05.305
Where is Jessica Hyde?

02:22.186 --> 02:23.945
My name is Jessica Hyde.

02:23.946 --> 02:26.265
Come with me now or you'll all die.

02:26.266 --> 02:28.505
Who are you and what's going on?

02:28.506 --> 02:30.105
Ian, don't point that gun at me.

02:30.106 --> 02:33.705
How... how do you know my name?

02:33.706 --> 02:35.305
Jessica Hyde?

02:35.306 --> 02:39.305
Wilson? They did this.

02:40.746 --> 02:42.985
We all have to go now.

02:42.986 --> 02:45.305
We're not going anywhere until
you tell us who you are,

02:45.306 --> 02:47.505
how you know my name
and what the fuck is going on.

02:47.506 --> 02:49.025
Ian, you won't be able to shoot me.

02:49.026 --> 02:50.585
Yeah? Don't imagine I won't, "Jess".

02:50.586 --> 02:52.505
No, really, you won't
be able to shoot me.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.505
You've got the safety catch on.

02:56.506 --> 03:00.505
They don't generally have
safety catches, except on telly.

03:05.666 --> 03:08.785
Every second we stay here is a
second they are getting closer

03:08.786 --> 03:12.785
and they'll kill us all.
Please, come with me.

03:13.986 --> 03:15.985
What about my dad? He's going home.

03:15.986 --> 03:19.065
I've arranged for someone to pick
up your dad from where he works.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.025
You don't know where he works.

03:21.026 --> 03:23.025
Davingdon's on Vesta Road.

03:23.026 --> 03:27.025
They're picking him up now.
I promise.

03:31.386 --> 03:35.385
I'm not sure about this.

03:35.626 --> 03:37.865
You two ready?

03:37.866 --> 03:40.305
Yeah, we're ready.

03:40.306 --> 03:44.305
There's CCTV at both ends of your
street. We'll go through the back.

04:04.906 --> 04:08.905
Stay there.

04:14.826 --> 04:18.825
What if someone's in?

04:57.346 --> 05:00.425
Social uprest
if prices continue to rise.

05:00.426 --> 05:04.185
The Shadow Home Secretary has
suggested the Government's apparent

05:04.186 --> 05:08.185
lack of planning
could lead to outbreak of...

05:16.386 --> 05:19.665
Is this your car?

05:19.666 --> 05:23.665
You're so cute.

05:25.786 --> 05:29.785
Are you going to tell us what's
going on? Who's after us?

05:34.306 --> 05:38.305
In the 1970s, the Soviets set up
a germ warfare programme called

05:38.346 --> 05:42.265
Biopreparat. It was huge.

05:42.266 --> 05:46.265
They were weaponising anthrax,
Ebola, smallpox, on a massive scale.

05:47.266 --> 05:51.265
The West panicked and created an
organisation to combat the threat.

05:51.386 --> 05:53.785
It was known as The Network.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.785
It was based in no country,
reported to no-one

05:55.786 --> 05:58.225
and was utterly deniable.

05:58.226 --> 06:02.225
It did things democratic
governments couldn't.

06:02.346 --> 06:06.025
They were insane,
totally out of control.

06:06.026 --> 06:09.145
What's that got to do with us?

06:09.146 --> 06:13.145
Basically, that's who's after you.

06:13.986 --> 06:17.985
You're fucking joking, right?

06:52.026 --> 06:54.745
Right.

06:54.746 --> 06:58.745
Do you know where that is yet?

06:59.386 --> 07:01.705
No.

07:01.706 --> 07:05.705
I'll come later, anyway.

07:27.906 --> 07:31.905
Gimmme the gun.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.945
We need clothes and money.
Your accounts are useless now.

07:35.946 --> 07:38.905
You're going to rob them?

07:38.906 --> 07:42.905
Let me make this very clear. Your
lives as you knew them are over.

07:43.666 --> 07:47.265
What the next 48 hours are about
is abandoning everything you knew

07:47.266 --> 07:50.625
or thought you could rely on
and adjusting to the new reality.

07:50.626 --> 07:54.625
If you can adjust you will live.
If you can't you will die.

07:55.706 --> 07:57.985
Now we need to change
the way you look.

07:57.986 --> 08:01.985
We need to get very far away
and we need drugs for Wilson.

08:04.706 --> 08:08.705
Give me the gun.

08:09.986 --> 08:12.705
Ian, hang on,
can we talk about this?

08:12.706 --> 08:16.585
I mean, it's an armed robbery.

08:16.586 --> 08:20.585
It's adjust or die, Ian.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.545
I don't know what to think of her.

09:02.546 --> 09:06.545
You could've fooled me.

09:08.546 --> 09:12.545
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

09:19.466 --> 09:23.465
What, you just going
to watch, are you?

09:25.066 --> 09:28.145
Here. Diamorphine.

09:28.146 --> 09:29.345
What, heroin?

09:29.346 --> 09:32.185
It's a painkiller. Do for now.

09:32.186 --> 09:34.145
You look good.

09:34.146 --> 09:37.145
Should wear that colour more often.

09:37.146 --> 09:41.145
You look shit. But in a good way.

09:42.146 --> 09:44.865
We need to get out of the city.

09:44.866 --> 09:47.185
We'll transfer to a van to
keep Wilson out of sight,

09:47.186 --> 09:51.185
then burn this out.

10:05.666 --> 10:09.665
Do you have the manuscript, Ian?

10:10.506 --> 10:14.505
Utopia Part Two.

10:15.786 --> 10:17.865
You need to tell me if you have it.

10:17.866 --> 10:20.665
We don't.

10:20.666 --> 10:24.145
Bejan never turned up.

10:24.146 --> 10:27.545
I haven't got Wilson's father.

10:27.546 --> 10:30.025
I need to do things
to keep us alive.

10:30.026 --> 10:32.465
Some of those things you
wouldn't normally approve of.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.305
This is insane.

10:34.306 --> 10:36.985
Yesterday I was arrested for a
sex crime, today I'm on the run

10:36.986 --> 10:39.565
from ex-government nutters
who want to pull out my eyes.

10:39.646 --> 10:41.711
I'm a fucking IT consultant.

10:45.027 --> 10:47.946
Geoff?
Hmmm?

10:47.947 --> 10:51.186
Have you seen this?

10:51.187 --> 10:52.786
Oh yes.

10:52.787 --> 10:56.146
Those bastards have got real
a bee in their bonnet about
the bloody vaccine.

10:56.147 --> 10:59.186
But they've named me.

10:59.187 --> 11:03.186
Well, you did buy it, Michael.

11:03.667 --> 11:07.626
In any case, there's nothing we can
do about it. We're tied into the
contract.

11:07.627 --> 11:11.626
Well... we're not, actually.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.426
I've found a cancellation clause.

11:13.427 --> 11:16.346
It can be enacted
if the department's total spend with

11:16.365 --> 11:19.204
the supplier is over 240 million.

11:19.205 --> 11:22.324
It's to ensure diversity of supply.

11:22.325 --> 11:24.764
Yeah, but this is only 83 million,
Michael, I mean...

11:24.765 --> 11:28.764
No, but it's total spend. We get
two other vaccines from Corvadt.

11:31.245 --> 11:35.244
Plus a wide range of antibiotics,
cytotoxics, hypoglycaemics...

11:37.645 --> 11:41.644
I mean, this puts us
well over 240 mil.

11:44.205 --> 11:48.204
Have the contracts sent to me
immediately. No-one to see them.

11:48.325 --> 11:51.004
Look, whatever Corvadt
are paying you,

11:51.005 --> 11:54.924
we are not going to
get away with it.

11:54.925 --> 11:57.364
We can stop all this.

11:57.365 --> 12:01.364
We can stop it all now.

12:03.245 --> 12:07.244
It's horrendous trying
to conceive, isn't it?

12:07.645 --> 12:11.644
The medical nature of it all,
the IVF, all that science.

12:13.125 --> 12:16.004
A man needs warmth.

12:16.005 --> 12:18.164
So I understand you fucking
a prostitute, I do.

12:18.165 --> 12:22.164
What I don't understand
is you getting her pregnant.

12:24.885 --> 12:28.884
Do you think
your wife will understand?

12:30.605 --> 12:34.604
Get the contract
straight over to me now.

12:34.805 --> 12:38.804
It's for the best.

12:56.485 --> 12:57.964
Ian and I are going up ahead to...

12:57.965 --> 13:01.964
Great. Have fun.

13:08.045 --> 13:09.444
Where are we going?

13:09.445 --> 13:13.404
I hack airline companies,
look for people going on holiday,

13:13.405 --> 13:17.404
stay at their houses.
They never know.

13:18.005 --> 13:21.444
This is connected to
a trip wire in the drive.

13:21.445 --> 13:24.164
Have everything by the back door,
always be ready to leave

13:24.165 --> 13:27.924
within 60 seconds.

13:27.925 --> 13:29.484
What if you're in the bath?

13:29.485 --> 13:32.564
No baths, no showers.

13:32.565 --> 13:35.124
It's time to stop worrying
about looking pretty, Becky.

13:35.125 --> 13:39.124
Are you trying to wind me up?

13:39.125 --> 13:43.124
There'd be no value
to that that I can see.

13:43.285 --> 13:46.404
You got a thing for
tough women, is it?

13:46.405 --> 13:48.404
Don't worry, Ian. I get it.

13:48.405 --> 13:52.324
Imagine her big,
strong arms around you.What?

13:52.325 --> 13:54.284
You let us walk into this.

13:54.285 --> 13:56.244
I mean, how much did you know?

13:56.245 --> 13:58.644
Because we had no idea.
Look at Wilson's face.

13:58.645 --> 14:00.164
And that is not my fault!

14:00.165 --> 14:01.924
Tell that to his dad.

14:01.925 --> 14:05.924
Because she doesn't have him,
by the way.

14:07.285 --> 14:11.284
Tell us the truth. All of it,
not bits, not pieces, all.

14:11.485 --> 14:15.044
Or I leave.

14:15.045 --> 14:17.204
Would you at least like
to sit down first, Becky?

14:17.205 --> 14:21.204
No, Jessica. I fucking wouldn't.

14:24.765 --> 14:28.284
The Network was created by two men.

14:28.285 --> 14:32.244
A geneticist called Philip Carvel,
and someone called Mr Rabbit...

14:32.245 --> 14:34.004
Mr Rabbit?

14:34.005 --> 14:37.844
It's a codename, no-one knows
the real identity.

14:37.845 --> 14:40.004
When the cold war began to wind down,

14:40.005 --> 14:43.164
the various governments involved
decided to back away.

14:43.165 --> 14:47.164
Only thing was, Mr Rabbit and
Carvel had no intention of stopping.

14:49.685 --> 14:53.684
At some point, Carvel wanted out.

14:54.005 --> 14:56.204
So they tortured him
to keep him working

14:56.205 --> 15:00.204
and held his daughter hostage.

15:00.285 --> 15:04.284
Eventually, his mind snapped
and he went mad.

15:06.965 --> 15:10.324
He was going be got rid of
but somehow he was smuggled out,

15:10.325 --> 15:14.324
given a new name and hidden
in a psychiatric hospital.

15:15.805 --> 15:18.404
The hospital was Shenley.

15:18.405 --> 15:20.844
And the new name was Mark Dane.

15:20.845 --> 15:22.684
What, you...

15:22.685 --> 15:26.684
you mean Carvel wrote Utopia?

15:27.525 --> 15:30.684
A therapist got him drawing.

15:30.685 --> 15:33.604
What he drew was...

15:33.605 --> 15:34.804
incredible.

15:34.805 --> 15:38.044
So all the things
in Utopia are real?

15:38.045 --> 15:42.044
What, like BSE, they created that?

15:42.045 --> 15:44.524
It's hard to say
what's real and what's not.

15:44.525 --> 15:48.524
But, yeah. BSE was theirs.

15:49.205 --> 15:52.564
How do you know all this?

15:52.565 --> 15:56.404
I'm Philip Carvel's daughter.

15:56.405 --> 16:00.404
I was smuggled out
with him when I was four.

16:00.885 --> 16:04.884
I've been on the run ever since.

16:40.405 --> 16:42.084
Did you pricks give me heroin?

16:42.085 --> 16:46.084
We had to, for the pain. Oh.

16:47.445 --> 16:49.844
Hope it wasn't Afghan.

16:49.845 --> 16:52.924
Taliban have been altering it
for years to make us infertile.

16:52.925 --> 16:56.924
Everyone knows that.

17:16.484 --> 17:19.124
We need to find Utopia.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.124
We start with where it came from.

17:21.125 --> 17:23.324
What? What about the others?

17:23.325 --> 17:27.324
It's fine. I left a note.

17:27.605 --> 17:30.084
"Back soon, don't have a bath."

17:30.085 --> 17:31.964
Look, Wilson needs someone to...

17:31.965 --> 17:33.324
That is not the reason!

17:33.325 --> 17:37.044
Don't you see what she's doing?
She's trying to divide us!

17:37.045 --> 17:39.364
- Becky, that makes no sense.
- Then why take you and not me?

17:39.365 --> 17:41.284
Because you're not strong enough.

17:41.285 --> 17:44.084
I can't risk taking you.

17:44.085 --> 17:47.284
I know stuff.
I know more than he does.

17:47.285 --> 17:48.924
What about Corvadt?

17:48.925 --> 17:51.004
They're involved,
they gave people disease.

17:51.005 --> 17:55.004
What about Corvadt?
They're involved, so what?

17:55.085 --> 17:59.084
They're a bit player.

17:59.245 --> 18:03.244
You're not ready, Becky.

18:05.805 --> 18:08.564
- Look, you just need time to...
- Right, go on then.

18:08.565 --> 18:12.564
Fuck off!

18:31.325 --> 18:35.324
What's that?

18:36.565 --> 18:38.484
It's nothing.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.084
It's work.

18:40.085 --> 18:44.084
Don't worry.

18:45.005 --> 18:47.244
'I very scared.'

18:47.245 --> 18:50.044
I know, I mean...

18:50.045 --> 18:54.044
They find out I pregnant,
they angry.

18:54.285 --> 18:57.364
You just have to get me some time.

18:57.365 --> 18:59.484
Michael, I think I watched.

18:59.485 --> 19:01.684
Watched? By who?

19:01.685 --> 19:04.444
Don't know. I scared.

19:04.445 --> 19:07.244
They come now.
Michael, you help, yes?

19:07.245 --> 19:11.244
You good man, yes...?

19:16.525 --> 19:18.244
Michael Dugdale?

19:18.245 --> 19:21.324
My name's William Kaye,
I'm a journalist,

19:21.325 --> 19:25.124
I want to talk
about the flu vaccine.

19:25.125 --> 19:29.844
- No, no, I'm sorry...
- Listen to me! Your life is in danger.

19:30.245 --> 19:32.684
This isn't about a fucking story!

19:32.685 --> 19:34.084
If I just wanted a story,

19:34.085 --> 19:38.084
I'd report the fact that you've got
a Russian prostitute pregnant.

19:39.565 --> 19:43.564
There's my card.

19:44.005 --> 19:47.484
Things are going to get mad.

19:47.485 --> 19:51.484
You'll need me when they do.

19:55.885 --> 19:59.884
Bejan got Utopia
from the comic shop.

20:01.925 --> 20:05.924
They got it from
a dealer in Scotland...

20:06.605 --> 20:10.044
who is now dead.

20:10.045 --> 20:12.804
And he got it from this guy,
Jack Tate.

20:12.805 --> 20:14.364
And who's Jack Tate?

20:14.365 --> 20:18.364
The man who published Utopia.

20:22.965 --> 20:24.404
Mrs Tate?

20:24.405 --> 20:25.444
Yes.

20:25.445 --> 20:27.084
We need to speak to your husband.

20:27.085 --> 20:29.204
Right.

20:29.205 --> 20:33.204
My... husband's dead.

20:33.285 --> 20:36.324
Do you want to come in?

20:36.325 --> 20:40.324
This was his study.

20:41.925 --> 20:45.484
Can you tell us where he died?

20:46.605 --> 20:50.484
The A22 under the Hailsham Bridge.

20:50.485 --> 20:52.964
He walked out in front of a lorry.

20:52.965 --> 20:55.804
I'm sorry. Do you miss him?

20:55.805 --> 20:59.804
Of course I miss him.

21:00.845 --> 21:04.684
Actually, I have something
you might be interested in.

21:04.685 --> 21:08.684
Yes, it's a... thing, I can't
describe it, papers and drawings.

21:09.605 --> 21:13.604
That sounds like exactly
the sort of thing we're looking for.

21:22.685 --> 21:24.524
We have to get out of here, now.

21:24.525 --> 21:28.524
What? Why?

21:29.365 --> 21:33.364
You might want these papers...

21:34.605 --> 21:36.684
What the fuck have you done?!

21:36.685 --> 21:37.524
She's with them.

21:37.525 --> 21:39.284
What? What are you talking about?

21:39.285 --> 21:43.284
Police turn up asking to see your
dead husband and you don't ask why?

21:45.885 --> 21:47.444
Ah, shit.

21:47.445 --> 21:49.804
Glock 22.

21:49.805 --> 21:50.924
She's CIA.

21:50.925 --> 21:53.644
It means she knows
next to fucking nothing.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.684
That's how they work.

21:55.685 --> 21:57.004
They have people high up

21:57.005 --> 22:01.004
who get their drones
to do their work for them.

22:21.285 --> 22:24.644
You're going to answer my questions.

22:24.645 --> 22:28.644
And if I think
you've told me even one lie...

22:28.725 --> 22:31.724
I'll put this wire
in the water...

22:31.725 --> 22:33.564
plug this in,

22:33.565 --> 22:36.364
flip the switch.

22:36.365 --> 22:40.364
Understand?

22:49.165 --> 22:53.164
Why are you here?

22:53.365 --> 22:55.924
We got a tip-off.

22:55.925 --> 22:58.404
The man who lived here

22:58.405 --> 23:02.404
has been wanted on terrorism
charges for over 25 years.

23:03.485 --> 23:06.324
We were too late,
he'd killed already himself,

23:06.325 --> 23:10.324
so... so we took his wife in.

23:10.485 --> 23:14.084
Has the wife given
you any information?

23:14.085 --> 23:18.084
I don't know.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.524
What did she say when you got here?

23:20.525 --> 23:24.524
On the day he died he was talking
crazy, he wasn't making sense,

23:25.645 --> 23:27.444
he said he'd been
visited by a tramp...

23:27.445 --> 23:30.964
"A tramp"?

23:30.965 --> 23:34.964
"A tramp" or "THE tramp"?

23:35.525 --> 23:38.364
I don't know, "the" maybe, or...?

23:38.365 --> 23:39.644
Look, hang on...

23:39.645 --> 23:43.164
I asked you a question.

23:43.165 --> 23:45.884
Was it "a tramp",

23:45.885 --> 23:47.844
or "the tramp"?

23:47.845 --> 23:51.844
"The". It was "the",
definitely "the".

23:55.525 --> 23:57.393
She said "the".

24:02.019 --> 24:04.298
- A select committee?
- Yes.

24:04.368 --> 24:08.367
With powers to look into all
aspects of the acquisition process.

24:08.648 --> 24:12.647
This is not going away, Geoff.
They're announcing it tomorrow.

24:14.448 --> 24:18.247
Do nothing. Keep quiet.

24:18.248 --> 24:21.647
The morning will bring something new.
It always does.

24:21.648 --> 24:24.047
Geoff, we can't do nothing!

24:24.261 --> 24:27.420
Well, it's sort of an order,
actually.

24:27.421 --> 24:30.660
Worry less.

24:30.661 --> 24:33.620
Look, I know it's scary now.

24:33.621 --> 24:37.620
But tomorrow you'll be a hero,
I promise.

25:29.941 --> 25:32.700
You didn't call in.

25:32.701 --> 25:36.420
We were worried.

25:36.421 --> 25:38.780
You're not agency. Who are you?

25:38.781 --> 25:42.060
No.

25:42.061 --> 25:46.060
I'm not agency.
I'm a specialist.

25:47.981 --> 25:51.980
What did you tell them?

25:52.221 --> 25:54.060
What did I tell them?

25:54.061 --> 25:58.060
They were going to fucking fry me,
what do you think I told them?
I told them everything I knew.

26:00.381 --> 26:03.580
Was it her?

26:03.581 --> 26:05.820
Yeah.

26:05.821 --> 26:08.100
Yeah, it was her.

26:08.101 --> 26:12.100
She was with
a young black male, 25, 28.

26:16.421 --> 26:20.420
Was a young man there?

26:21.461 --> 26:25.460
Messed-up face, missing an eye?

26:30.221 --> 26:32.580
Er...

26:32.581 --> 26:35.860
no.

26:35.861 --> 26:39.860
No, just them.

26:51.501 --> 26:55.500
Look, are you going to untie me?

27:03.701 --> 27:06.820
Wow. That looks great.

27:06.821 --> 27:10.820
It's like, um, pirate chic.

27:11.701 --> 27:13.020
How's your sight?

27:13.021 --> 27:17.020
Er... I can see shapes and colours.

27:19.941 --> 27:23.940
Thanks for looking after me, Becky.

27:27.821 --> 27:31.820
Where's my dad?

27:33.181 --> 27:36.260
She lied.

27:36.261 --> 27:39.060
She had to get us out, Wilson.

27:39.061 --> 27:41.060
I mean, he's probably fine.

27:41.061 --> 27:42.100
I need to find out.

27:42.101 --> 27:43.700
We can't.

27:43.701 --> 27:46.460
They'll be monitoring our families,
we'll put them in danger...

27:46.461 --> 27:49.020
Look online, I'll show you how to
disguise the search.

27:49.021 --> 27:50.900
I swear they won't know it
came from here.

27:50.901 --> 27:52.020
Wilson, we can't.

27:52.021 --> 27:56.020
I need to know.

27:56.461 --> 28:00.420
Please.

28:00.421 --> 28:02.580
His name's Milton.

28:02.581 --> 28:05.660
Milton? Milton Wilson?

28:05.661 --> 28:09.660
What is it
with your family and names?

28:10.261 --> 28:12.500
Right, you're sure they can't trace
this?

28:12.501 --> 28:14.980
Positive. He's a cricket nut,
he logs in every day.

28:14.981 --> 28:17.260
You'll see whether or not
he's logged in.

28:17.261 --> 28:18.460
Is he there?

28:18.461 --> 28:22.460
Hang on, I'm not in yet.

28:29.341 --> 28:33.340
Is he there?

28:36.101 --> 28:40.100
Er... Yeah.

28:43.221 --> 28:47.220
Yeah, yeah, he's there, he's fine.

28:52.621 --> 28:56.620
Grant has the manuscript.

28:56.861 --> 29:00.860
I heard them talking about it,
they mentioned him.

29:01.741 --> 29:05.740
I weren't going to fucking tell her.

29:24.461 --> 29:28.460
Who are you, then?

29:30.261 --> 29:33.100
I'm Alice.

29:33.101 --> 29:35.580
What are you doing?

29:35.581 --> 29:37.100
You're not from this school.

29:37.101 --> 29:38.580
Just fuck off before you get hurt!

29:38.581 --> 29:41.060
I'm not scared of you!

29:41.061 --> 29:44.780
What's that?

29:44.781 --> 29:46.180
Comic.

29:46.181 --> 29:50.180
Well? Are you going to show me or
are you going to be a twat all day?

29:55.661 --> 29:59.660
Are you going to tell me your name,
then, twat?

29:59.981 --> 30:01.340
Grant.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.940
Pleased to meet you, Grant.

30:02.941 --> 30:06.940
Alice.

30:08.821 --> 30:10.940
Shit!

30:10.941 --> 30:12.620
Don't go.

30:12.621 --> 30:16.620
Same time tomorrow, twat.

30:26.381 --> 30:28.300
Are you sure this'll work?

30:28.301 --> 30:30.340
Fanaticomix?
Grant's addicted to it.

30:30.341 --> 30:31.620
It's nerd heaven.

30:31.621 --> 30:35.020
And you have to read the personals
or you miss the good stuff.

30:35.021 --> 30:39.020
I don't, but other people do.

30:40.861 --> 30:43.340
But what if they're monitoring it?

30:43.341 --> 30:45.500
Say to meet at the Embassy.

30:45.501 --> 30:48.100
Dane based the Embassy
on the Taunton building

30:48.101 --> 30:49.940
on the Kame Hill Estate.

30:49.941 --> 30:53.940
Only a real twat would know that.

30:54.221 --> 30:56.460
And me.

30:56.461 --> 30:59.140
Never deny your inner twat, Wilson.

30:59.141 --> 31:01.300
It's part of your charm.

31:01.301 --> 31:05.300
Oh.

31:19.741 --> 31:23.060
20...

31:23.061 --> 31:27.060
and then six plus something
equals 20...

31:42.261 --> 31:44.260
Don't forget to brush.

31:44.261 --> 31:45.620
I won't.

31:45.621 --> 31:47.260
Good night, Mummy.

31:47.261 --> 31:48.780
Sleep tight, darling.

31:48.781 --> 31:52.780
Love you.

31:54.381 --> 31:57.780

31:57.781 --> 32:01.020

What are you doing?

32:14.301 --> 32:17.940
Can I sleep on your floor?

32:17.941 --> 32:21.940
I won't do nothing, I promise.

32:28.181 --> 32:32.180
Have you got that comic?

32:32.221 --> 32:34.180
This is so beautiful.

32:34.181 --> 32:36.460
Yeah. And that's part two.

32:36.461 --> 32:40.460
No-one's ever seen that,
just you and me.

32:42.901 --> 32:45.460
You're quite surprising, you know.

32:45.461 --> 32:49.460
You strike me more as a
Spider-Man type.

32:50.701 --> 32:53.180
Oh, we should sleep.

32:53.181 --> 32:55.047
If my mum sees a light,
she'll come in.

33:50.196 --> 33:53.715
Twat.

33:53.716 --> 33:57.715
Thanks for letting me read Utopia.

34:10.076 --> 34:13.355
Just to look after, like.

34:13.356 --> 34:16.475
Keep it under your bed.

34:16.476 --> 34:19.755
I-I-I'll come back...

34:19.755 --> 34:23.755
for that.

34:34.076 --> 34:36.114
Did they come back last night?

34:36.116 --> 34:40.114
Nope. Wankers.

34:40.516 --> 34:43.835
What we going to do?

34:43.835 --> 34:45.995
I know what I'm going to do.

34:45.996 --> 34:49.795
I'm going to have a fucking bath.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.815
'We're getting more information

34:51.860 --> 34:53.339
'on our breaking news story -

34:53.340 --> 34:55.779
'the outbreak of flu
in the Shetland Islands.

34:55.780 --> 34:58.219
'We can confirm
two more people have now died

34:58.220 --> 35:00.859
'bringing the death toll to 11.

35:00.860 --> 35:03.939
'That's 11 now dead
on the Shetland Island of Fetlar

35:03.940 --> 35:06.819
'from the suspected
outbreak of Russian flu.'

35:08.060 --> 35:12.059
Shit!

35:13.140 --> 35:17.139
18 dead, 33 infected.
There's only 86 on the island.

35:17.580 --> 35:20.619
Geoff's ordered a quarantine.
No-one gets in or out.

35:20.620 --> 35:23.299
Right.

35:23.300 --> 35:27.299
If it's a new strain, it's got
infection rates already of 58%.

35:28.660 --> 35:32.659
Michael, thank god
you got the vaccine.

35:33.020 --> 35:37.019
You're a fucking hero.

35:48.140 --> 35:51.899
You tell them my name?
Did you tell them my fucking name?

35:51.900 --> 35:54.539
No, no, I didn't say anything.

35:54.540 --> 35:56.859
I think they're on to me.

35:56.860 --> 35:59.939
I think I'm being followed.
I saw two men.

36:00.028 --> 36:01.507
Jesus Christ!

36:01.508 --> 36:03.387
Have you seen the news?

36:03.388 --> 36:06.427
It's happening. I told you.

36:06.428 --> 36:09.307
What do I do?

36:09.308 --> 36:13.307
I mean, people are dying!

36:14.948 --> 36:17.467
We need a sample of the vaccine.

36:17.468 --> 36:19.667
You can request one
direct from Corvadt.

36:19.668 --> 36:22.787
It's within your remit as advisor.
There's a man in Sheffield.

36:22.788 --> 36:26.787
A scientist called Donaldson.
Get it to him.

36:26.948 --> 36:30.947
What about you?

36:32.068 --> 36:36.067
What about you?

37:10.548 --> 37:14.547
Do exactly as I fucking say!

37:18.188 --> 37:22.067
The Tramp used to be a scientist
with the Network. He got out.

37:22.068 --> 37:24.587
Now he monitors their activities.

37:24.588 --> 37:27.987
He has to keep under the radar
to stay alive.

37:27.988 --> 37:29.747
I reckon that's his office.

37:29.748 --> 37:33.307
A public phone?

37:33.308 --> 37:36.227
Here we go.

37:36.228 --> 37:38.627
Him? But...

37:38.628 --> 37:40.827
He really is a tramp?

37:40.828 --> 37:44.827
Yeah, he's called 'The Tramp', Ian.

37:52.388 --> 37:56.027
Hello, Danny.

37:56.028 --> 37:59.467
Oh, shit! Oh!

37:59.468 --> 38:03.467
Fucking hell!

38:03.988 --> 38:07.707
You nearly broke my nose. You
nearly broke my fucking nose!

38:07.708 --> 38:09.187
Jessica, how lovely.

38:09.188 --> 38:12.987
How did you know Utopia
had a part two?

38:12.988 --> 38:15.667
He's on our side, isn't he?

38:15.668 --> 38:18.787
There's no sides.

38:18.788 --> 38:22.747
Just people who help you
and people who don't.

38:22.748 --> 38:25.827
Now, now, Jess, you know
a gentleman never reveals his...

38:25.828 --> 38:29.827
Don't make me ask you again, Danny.

38:31.268 --> 38:34.187
Jack told me years ago.

38:34.188 --> 38:38.107
I went to see him now
because I wanted part two.

38:38.108 --> 38:39.987
I knew Jack from
the old days, you see.

38:39.988 --> 38:41.627
Why?

38:41.628 --> 38:43.347
What's in it?

38:43.348 --> 38:44.587
He never told me,

38:44.588 --> 38:48.307
and when your father died
it didn't matter any more

38:48.308 --> 38:52.307
but now they have something.

38:54.188 --> 38:58.187
Your father was working on a project
called Janus before he died.

39:00.148 --> 39:03.147
They've replicated his research.

39:03.148 --> 39:07.147
They have it.
They're going to test it.

39:07.908 --> 39:11.587
And what does Janus do?

39:11.588 --> 39:14.267
I swear I don't know.

39:14.268 --> 39:16.307
The last thing
your father was working on

39:16.308 --> 39:20.307
were viral delivery vectors
that attack the human genome.

39:23.068 --> 39:25.747
And Tate? What did he say?

39:25.748 --> 39:28.547
He said that this is the end.

39:28.548 --> 39:32.147
He said we are all finished.

39:32.148 --> 39:36.147
And he took his own life.

39:37.668 --> 39:40.587
We need to work together, Jess,
you and I...

39:40.588 --> 39:44.587
What I still don't get is
what you were going to do with it.

39:46.748 --> 39:50.747
I mean, what use would it be to a
decrepit old sack of filth like you?

39:54.348 --> 39:58.347
What do you think your last breath
will feel like, Danny?

40:05.588 --> 40:07.827
There's a woman. MI5.

40:07.828 --> 40:09.287
They already have MI5.

40:09.315 --> 40:13.314
Not this one. She's like us.
Works in secret, trusts no-one.

40:14.722 --> 40:16.121
She can help.

40:16.122 --> 40:20.121
Now, Jess, if you get me
the manuscript I can get it to her.

40:20.562 --> 40:24.561
What's her name?

40:25.042 --> 40:29.041
Please don't make me
tell you that, Jessica.

40:35.682 --> 40:39.681
Milner. Her name's Milner.

40:40.322 --> 40:44.321
She's a good woman, Jessica.

40:44.722 --> 40:48.201
Ian, we need a vehicle.
You've seen me enough times.

40:48.202 --> 40:52.201
It's time for you to do it.

41:01.402 --> 41:04.441
Why didn't he give it to you?

41:04.442 --> 41:08.441
Bit odd?

41:08.962 --> 41:12.921
I'm on your side, Jessica,
you know that.

41:12.922 --> 41:16.921
I'm one of the...

41:55.762 --> 41:57.921
If we found him, they would.

41:57.922 --> 42:01.201
He gave up Milner's name like that.
You saw what they did to Wilson.

42:01.202 --> 42:03.121
So you just killed him?

42:03.122 --> 42:06.081
- I pulled up the ladder.
- What?

42:06.082 --> 42:09.521
You fucking killed him!
You took his life!

42:09.522 --> 42:13.521
You just kill people if they're
not convenient, is that it?

42:15.762 --> 42:19.761
Why are you being so odd?

42:32.162 --> 42:36.161
What the fuck are you doing?

42:41.602 --> 42:44.201
They... They just came in.

42:44.202 --> 42:46.241
So you tied them up?

42:46.242 --> 42:49.881
Children? You tied up children?

42:49.882 --> 42:52.481
We're making it
look like a burglary!

42:52.482 --> 42:55.441
You did the right thing.

42:55.442 --> 42:58.001
We meet here tomorrow, 10pm.

42:58.002 --> 43:02.001
Keep Wilson out of sight.
Stay on country roads, avoid CCTV.

43:02.042 --> 43:06.041
You did exactly the right thing.

43:10.242 --> 43:14.241
So, I-I-I want
a sample of the vaccine.

43:16.682 --> 43:20.681
I-I-I'm sure you understand,
with the events of last night.

43:20.802 --> 43:24.801
So, this is an R680 request...

43:25.682 --> 43:28.841
Excellent, yes. You want a sample.

43:28.842 --> 43:32.841
Yes, it's all filled. It's all
in order. The paperwork is...

43:33.242 --> 43:37.241
What do you want it for?

43:40.122 --> 43:44.121
You are contractually obliged
to supply a sample within 48 hours.

43:44.402 --> 43:47.401
Yes, of course. Something wrong?

43:47.402 --> 43:50.881
No, no, nothing's wrong.
I just need... I want a sample.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.201
I can do that.

43:52.202 --> 43:55.721
'Freelance journalist,
William Kaye has been murdered

43:55.722 --> 43:58.241
'in a car park in Wapping
in East London,

43:58.242 --> 44:02.201
'in what is being described by police
as a gangland-style execution.

44:02.202 --> 44:06.201
'Mr Kaye was shot three times
in the chest and once in the head.

44:06.202 --> 44:08.161
'Police have a suspect in custody,

44:08.162 --> 44:11.441
'a Russian National
named as Anya Lutchenko.'

44:11.442 --> 44:12.841
Anya?!

44:12.842 --> 44:16.081
'Police have described her
as a sex worker. The detective...'

44:24.762 --> 44:28.561
How's your wife, Dugdale?

44:28.562 --> 44:32.561
Still trying to conceive, are you?

44:32.962 --> 44:36.961
Still trying for a little baby?

44:39.162 --> 44:43.161
Forget the vaccine, Mr Dugdale.
You're not a spy.

44:46.362 --> 44:49.281
Becky, they'll be in
the Taunton Building.

44:49.282 --> 44:52.361
It's a huge water tower

44:52.362 --> 44:53.721
and, Becky, be careful.

44:53.722 --> 44:57.721
Grant's a city trader.
He's bound to be a cock.

45:36.962 --> 45:40.481
Are you Becky?

45:40.482 --> 45:44.481
Grant?

45:49.042 --> 45:53.041
I thought you were a city trader?

45:59.682 --> 46:01.201
Fuck me.

46:01.202 --> 46:05.201
Don't worry. It's just Wilson.
He's been hurt.

46:05.242 --> 46:09.241
You better get in the back with him.

46:09.322 --> 46:11.681
Wilson Wilson?

46:11.682 --> 46:13.561
You look a mess, man.

46:13.562 --> 46:15.321
Bloody hell, you sound about ten.

46:15.322 --> 46:17.001
Close. He's 11.

46:17.002 --> 46:19.401
What? Really?

46:19.402 --> 46:22.921
You said you owned a Porsche and that
your girlfriend was a supermodel.

46:22.922 --> 46:24.761
Yeah, I've got ambitions.

46:26.562 --> 46:30.561
Stay here and be nice, both of you.

46:34.362 --> 46:38.361
She got a boyfriend?

46:38.922 --> 46:42.921
I'm just going to get some water
for us from the shop, OK?

46:54.162 --> 46:58.161
It's me. The manuscript exists.

46:58.922 --> 47:00.601
The boy.

47:00.602 --> 47:04.601
The boy knows where it is.

47:22.202 --> 47:26.201
Where is Jessica Hyde?
