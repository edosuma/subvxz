00:13.012 --> 00:16.183
[man and woman speaking Turkish]

00:49.174 --> 00:51.301
[in Turkish] Thank you, Kadir.

01:03.896 --> 01:04.897
[in English] Excellent.

01:06.023 --> 01:08.025
Please tell your wife
she makes it even better

01:08.110 --> 01:09.861
than they did in Constantinople.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.989
I think you mean Istanbul, ma'am.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.993
Constantinople, this is its ancient name.

01:17.660 --> 01:18.786
Of course.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.350
[tires screech]

01:44.020 --> 01:45.147
[door opens]

01:55.240 --> 01:56.574
The Black Sky.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.910
We have it.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.165
[sighs heavily]

02:28.481 --> 02:29.732
[elevator thuds]

02:36.781 --> 02:38.991
[Sowande] How long
have you waited for this?

02:40.034 --> 02:41.161
Too long.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.610
[Sowande] This will use
the last of our resources.

03:15.027 --> 03:17.239
Are you sure it is a risk worth taking?

03:18.740 --> 03:21.368
I have never been more sure of anything.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.529
[inaudible]

05:25.282 --> 05:26.993
[gasps and screams]

05:34.834 --> 05:36.544
[breathing heavily]

05:38.087 --> 05:39.088
[groans]

05:45.845 --> 05:47.472
[grunting softly]

05:54.771 --> 05:58.107
I know you're afraid, but that will pass.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.735
So will the pain.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.159
-[whimpering]
-[shushing] It's all right.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.120
It's all right.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.750
[grunts]

06:17.001 --> 06:19.336
-Stand down.
-[breathing heavily]

06:29.639 --> 06:31.057
This is your home now.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.686
We are your family.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.315
I have waited so long to meet you.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.360
[grunting]

06:44.028 --> 06:45.404
[groaning]

06:47.114 --> 06:48.908
[grunting]

06:53.079 --> 06:55.164
[screaming]

06:55.247 --> 06:56.290
[shushing]

06:56.373 --> 06:58.084
[Elektra straining]

07:00.545 --> 07:01.921
Easy.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.716
Easy, my child. Easy.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.343
Easy. [shushing]

07:13.224 --> 07:14.266
Go ahead.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.019
You'll need your strength.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.736
Language will come back to you.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.321
So will your instincts.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.949
But everything else...

07:31.951 --> 07:34.203
I'm afraid it wasn't worth keeping anyway.

07:43.295 --> 07:44.296
[Elektra] You...

07:49.010 --> 07:51.387
[sighing] You...

07:52.847 --> 07:55.808
My name is Alexandra.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.188
You were born.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.858
You lived and died.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.488
And what you saw on the other side...

08:09.906 --> 08:14.201
the darkness, the absence of everything...

08:16.538 --> 08:18.080
it's horrifying, isn't it?

08:20.374 --> 08:21.751
I have seen it, too.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.420
More than once.

08:25.129 --> 08:28.925
And all I want in this life
is never to see it again.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.598
But now that we've been
brought together...

08:36.724 --> 08:38.810
that's not something
we need to worry about.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.151
Who?

08:49.779 --> 08:51.155
[stammers] Who?

08:55.117 --> 08:56.243
My child...

09:01.498 --> 09:04.961
you... are everything.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.508
You are everything.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.398
It doesn't matter what you choose.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.526
You are the Black Sky.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.782
In the end, you are the weapon.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.667
Wakizashi.

09:47.294 --> 09:48.504
Good choice.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.841
They won't know what's coming
till it's too late.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.279
[grunting]

10:14.363 --> 10:15.782
[man grunting]

10:16.699 --> 10:18.409

10:19.410 --> 10:20.745

10:40.890 --> 10:42.141

[bone cracks]

11:55.214 --> 11:56.715
[man groaning]

12:07.143 --> 12:08.185
She's ready.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.495
-[all grunting]
-[blades clashing]

12:42.011 --> 12:43.262
Bring it to her.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.439
You asked me a question.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.275
This is the answer.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.239
This is who you are.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.168
[theme music playing]

14:30.202 --> 14:31.370
[door opens]

14:35.749 --> 14:36.918
[Sowande] She's ready for you.

14:45.467 --> 14:50.514
The war that you've been fighting
your entire life, Stick, it's over.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.560
Long as Iron Fist lives, nothing's over.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.478
Where is he?

14:57.229 --> 14:58.439
Damned if I know.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.650
We're not doing
the torture song and dance.

15:01.733 --> 15:02.859
Not anymore.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.570
Shame.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.156
I grew to like that part.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.910
Danny Rand has been running around
off the grid for months.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.038
He thinks he's a one-man army.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.665
He's a real handful.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.542
I've seen better.

15:18.625 --> 15:23.380
Still, you'll spend the rest of your days
looking over your shoulder.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.258
And from what I hear...

15:27.009 --> 15:29.553
[chuckles] those days are numbered.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.390
[Stick grunts]

15:34.516 --> 15:35.642
[chuckles] Now...

15:36.893 --> 15:40.147
-that's the Alexandra I know.
-Pay attention.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.487
You make a new friend?

15:46.570 --> 15:49.406
[Alexandra] No, Stick.
I took one of yours.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.119
[sniffs]

15:53.995 --> 15:55.371
[breathing heavily]

15:55.454 --> 15:58.249
-Elektra.
-The vessel you knew is gone.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.834
Only the Black Sky lives.

16:01.668 --> 16:03.504
[Stick] Listen to me, kid.
She's full of shit.

16:03.587 --> 16:07.716
-We gotta get you out--
-Where is the Iron Fist?

16:07.799 --> 16:10.927
I'll die before I let him join your army.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.515
You think I want him to fight for me?

16:15.099 --> 16:18.019
He's a weapon. You're a monster.
What else?

16:18.102 --> 16:20.896
After a lifetime of serving K'un-Lun...

16:21.772 --> 16:23.315
you don't even know what he is.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.734
No.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.321
But I know what I am.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.576
You asked for it... Elektra.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.413
[all grunting]

16:43.169 --> 16:45.129
You'll die here tonight, old man.

16:45.212 --> 16:48.090
-Finally.
-Don't you bet on it.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.093
[groans]

16:51.177 --> 16:52.969
[all grunting]

17:02.021 --> 17:03.314
[panting]

17:08.569 --> 17:10.071
[Alexandra] Son of a bitch.

17:14.866 --> 17:17.286
-Are you a public defender?
-Uh, no.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.081
-Then what are you doing here?
-A friend referred me. He works for--

17:20.164 --> 17:22.374
-Let me guess, Jeri Hogarth.
-Right.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.044
I didn't know she did diversity hires.

17:25.711 --> 17:29.048
[chuckles] Uh, I'm independent.
I don't work for her firm.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.633
-Well, I'm not paying you.
-You don't have to.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.885
-Oh, 'cause she'll foot the bill?
-Yeah.

17:34.761 --> 17:37.806
And I'm a Catholic.
I have a soft spot for hopeless causes.

17:37.889 --> 17:38.974
[chuckles]

17:39.891 --> 17:42.686
-That was a bad joke. Sorry.
-Barely.

17:42.769 --> 17:44.980
Uh, Ms. Jones, may I ask
how long you've been a PI?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.315
No.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.860
Are you always this rude
to people trying to help you?

17:51.320 --> 17:53.905
You know what?
I'm gonna find my own lawyer, thanks.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.576
Okay. Uh, well, in reality,
you don't need one.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.246
After talking
to the lead detective outside,

18:00.329 --> 18:02.456
it appears that despite the mess
you got yourself into,

18:02.539 --> 18:05.792
the NYPD doesn't actually have anything
to hold you on, so...

18:05.876 --> 18:07.669
-So I can walk?
-Mm-hmm.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.464
Though your apartment and office are
still considered an active crime scene.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.799
You'll need to make yourself available
for follow-up questions,

18:12.883 --> 18:14.176
-so in the meantime--
-Don't leave town.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.427
Yeah, I know the drill.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.308
Ms. Jones, can... May... Uh...

18:23.477 --> 18:25.396
Look, there's no easy way to say this.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.440
I read your file. I know who you are.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.526
What you can do.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.447
I know what happened
with Kilgrave, so if--

18:35.531 --> 18:38.242
-This has nothing to do with that.
-Okay, great. Then...

18:38.325 --> 18:40.119
Look, I'm... I'm just saying, legally,

18:40.202 --> 18:43.330
if there's anything,
this will stay between us if...

18:43.414 --> 18:48.544
this was... There's anything not, uh,
ordinary about this case.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.756
What part of "I know the drill"
did you not understand?

18:53.924 --> 18:54.925
Nothing happened.

18:55.634 --> 18:56.635
I'm good.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.807
Great. Then I guess you're free to go.

19:13.610 --> 19:16.863
Malcolm? Yeah, I just gave my statement.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.451
Are you okay?
What exactly did you tell them?

19:32.671 --> 19:33.755
[Claire] Hey.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.259
-What happened?
-Hey.

19:38.635 --> 19:42.306
The kids are being recruited by some guy
known on the streets as White Hat.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.225
I don't know what he's up to,

19:44.308 --> 19:46.810
but they're doing
some kind of clean-up work.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.063
-Cleaning up what?
-I didn't get a look, but...

19:52.691 --> 19:53.817
What's wrong?

19:56.487 --> 19:58.989
[sighs] That kid, Cole...

20:00.366 --> 20:01.742
cops just picked him up.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.078
-He's probably in jail by now.
-Hmm.

20:05.161 --> 20:08.039
-I left him behind, Claire.
-It's okay.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.500
No, it's not.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.462
You're better off not in prison.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.592
I like you here.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.099
-[grunts]
-What happened?

20:26.182 --> 20:27.183
I got clocked.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.232
-By White Hat?
-No. I don't know who he was.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.734
But when he hit me,
it felt like a sledgehammer.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.404
He had this... this hand.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.031
I think it glowed.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.575
Glowed how?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.952
I don't know. Just some skinny white kid.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.415
-He had this fist and...
-[sighs]

20:50.707 --> 20:53.502
-Who you calling?
-There's someone that you need to meet.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.049
-He punched me.
-You punched first.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.677
Seriously?

21:01.760 --> 21:04.596
-How come he can't be hurt?
-What's the deal with that fist?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.222
-I earned it.
-You what?

21:06.307 --> 21:07.474
[stammers] He earned it.

21:08.224 --> 21:10.769
There's this mystical place
called K'un-Lun, and it's--

21:10.852 --> 21:12.354
I can answer myself.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.983
-There's a mystical place called K'un-Lun.
-Oh, this is a joke. Come on.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.569
My parents died in a plane crash.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.947
I was adopted by a group of monks.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.740
There, I learned how to summon my chi.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.909
I'm the Immortal Iron Fist.

21:27.744 --> 21:28.829
Is this why you went to China?

21:29.871 --> 21:32.791
Whatever it is that you saw last night,
this White Hat guy...

21:33.542 --> 21:36.462
could be connected to the people
Danny and Colleen have been fighting.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.298
The same people who attacked the hospital
that Claire was working at.

21:39.381 --> 21:42.301
You're saying you know
who this White Hat guy is?

21:43.009 --> 21:45.304
No. But I think he's with the Hand.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.764
It's a criminal organization.

21:47.848 --> 21:48.974
No telling how old they are.

21:49.057 --> 21:51.810
[Colleen] Nor how much influence
they have. They are everywhere.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.395
In everything.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.859
All of their power stems
from their ability to bring back the dead.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.653
Okay, I don't know
how much of this I can take.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.448
-This sounds insane.
-And so does being bulletproof.

22:05.281 --> 22:09.411
The two of you trust me,
so please listen when I say...

22:10.537 --> 22:12.748
you're on the same side.

22:15.041 --> 22:18.962
Now, we're gonna leave you two alone,
and you're gonna talk.

22:20.839 --> 22:21.840
Talk.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.261
[Danny clears throat]

22:30.682 --> 22:33.268
[Michelle] Couple months ago,
we were planning a vacation.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.311
He wanted to get away.

22:36.647 --> 22:37.898
Doesn't make sense.

22:40.066 --> 22:41.151
I came to you...

22:42.528 --> 22:44.863
for answers. And now...

22:47.115 --> 22:49.826
Well, the NYPD is on the case, but...

22:49.910 --> 22:51.244
[Michelle sniffles]

22:51.327 --> 22:54.080
...between us,
I would like to keep investigating.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.125
-You mean without the police?
-Yeah.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.627
[Michelle sighs]

22:59.252 --> 23:02.213
-I don't know how much I can afford.
-Don't worry about that right now.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.591
Okay. Okay.

23:06.885 --> 23:09.971
Now, is there anything
you haven't told me?

23:10.055 --> 23:11.056
[Michelle sighs]

23:11.139 --> 23:14.142
Drugs? You know, gambling,
weird fetish shit? Was there any world

23:14.225 --> 23:16.019
-that he was a part of?
-No. No.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.148
Why? What did you see?

23:24.736 --> 23:26.738
I think someone was targeting him.

23:27.739 --> 23:28.865
What do you mean?

23:31.910 --> 23:32.911
I'm not sure.

23:33.704 --> 23:36.957
[sighs and sniffles]
None of this sounds like John.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.667
He wasn't this kind of person.

23:40.461 --> 23:44.840
And there's nothing I'm not telling you.
[crying] There's nothing I don't know.

23:45.966 --> 23:50.136
He loved two things.
He loved us and his job.

23:50.846 --> 23:54.390
And that's it. That was his whole life.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.353
[knocking on door]

23:58.436 --> 24:01.397
[sniffles and sighs] I'll be right back.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.944
[sighs]

24:12.033 --> 24:13.076
[door opens]

24:13.159 --> 24:16.747
-[woman] Hi, sweetie. How are you?
-[Michelle] Hi, Mom. I'm okay.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.582
[indistinct chatter]

24:21.084 --> 24:22.628
[woman] I'm sure we'll find out soon.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.463
Why don't we lay you down,
and you can let me fix you supper.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.021
Hey.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.778
I'm sorry about what happened.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.036
Um... tell your mom I let myself out.

24:57.663 --> 24:58.872
[door opens]

25:00.165 --> 25:01.166
[door closes]

25:04.252 --> 25:06.004
[indistinct chatter]

26:14.114 --> 26:16.407
[footsteps echoing in distance]

26:27.794 --> 26:29.545
[indistinct chatter]

27:27.896 --> 27:29.230
[Matt grunting]

27:41.617 --> 27:43.328
[cell phone vibrating]

27:46.164 --> 27:47.165
Hello?

27:47.248 --> 27:49.375
[woman] Hi, I'm returning
a call from Ms. Anna Asher.

27:49.459 --> 27:52.128
-What?
-This is Duncan and Dotter Design.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.547
Oh, right, this is her. Sorry.

27:54.630 --> 27:57.175
-Um, can you come in this afternoon?
-Sure.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.427
211 10th Avenue, suite 305.

27:59.510 --> 28:01.429
-305. Got it.
-Thank you, Ms. Asher.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.858
-You can fight.
-[scoffs]

28:14.067 --> 28:16.611
-You can take a punch.
-[chuckles softly]

28:18.363 --> 28:20.115
Claire said they did experiments on you.

28:22.325 --> 28:24.244
Long story. [sighs]

28:25.036 --> 28:26.037
What kind?

28:27.372 --> 28:28.539
Was it voluntary?

28:29.624 --> 28:30.876
They made me this way.

28:31.918 --> 28:33.169
That's all you need to know.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.886
What did you mean, "chi"?

28:40.969 --> 28:42.178
[chuckles]

28:43.054 --> 28:45.431
It's a... It's an energy force.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.476
-Okay.
-We all have it.

28:50.436 --> 28:52.313
-Not like that.
-[chuckles softly]

28:53.106 --> 28:54.440
I trained for years.

28:55.776 --> 28:57.152
There was a test.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.031
There was a dragon.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.699
[laughing]

29:06.161 --> 29:07.578
No, there wasn't.

29:07.662 --> 29:10.498
[Colleen chuckles] It's going better
than I thought it would.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.250
[Danny] I know how it sounds,
but it's true.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.961
You gotta admit,
that dragon shit, from the outside...

29:15.754 --> 29:17.422
-does sound pretty crazy.
-Mm-hmm.

29:17.505 --> 29:18.799
[both chuckle]

29:20.633 --> 29:22.635
You really think
they can help each other out?

29:23.303 --> 29:25.096
[clicks tongue] I don't know.

29:26.597 --> 29:28.349
Once they're done
with the pissing contest...

29:28.433 --> 29:30.351
-[chuckles]
-...who knows?

29:31.352 --> 29:33.479
-[sighs]
-[Luke] Claire says you're a good guy.

29:34.522 --> 29:35.565
I'm trying.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.526
She says you've done a lot for Harlem.

29:39.569 --> 29:42.238
Yeah, I just... just wanna help.

29:42.948 --> 29:43.949
Me, too.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.742
That's what led me to that warehouse.

29:49.704 --> 29:53.499
You call that helping? You were gonna
beat that kid within an inch of his life.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.086
[scoffs] Come on.
I wasn't gonna kill him.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.503
It sure looked like it.

29:58.754 --> 30:00.298
The Hand is dangerous.

30:00.381 --> 30:04.219
They murdered my parents.
Invaded the city I was sworn to protect.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.636
That kid's got nothing
to do with all that.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.389
Of course he does. He works for them.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.851
-He needed a job.
-That's not an excuse.

30:11.767 --> 30:13.854
You never fought someone
to protect someone else?

30:13.937 --> 30:16.231
-Of course I have.
-Okay, so what's the difference?

30:16.314 --> 30:18.649
The difference is I live on their block.

30:19.442 --> 30:22.237
The difference is
I'm not some billionaire white boy

30:22.320 --> 30:23.613
who takes justice into his own hands

30:23.696 --> 30:26.616
and slams a black kid against the wall
because of his personal vendetta.

30:26.699 --> 30:28.659
Claire told me about you
on the way over here.

30:29.452 --> 30:32.705
Not all the mystical parts,
but everything else.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.249
The money?

30:35.291 --> 30:36.626
That doesn't define me.

30:37.335 --> 30:40.546
Maybe not, but that kid is sitting
in a jail cell tonight and you're not.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.841
-Neither are you.
-Not this time.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.886
But I've seen my share of injustice.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.596
The guy in the white hat,
he's just the beginning.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.932
You're not thinking
about the bigger picture.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.808
You're not thinking
about anything but yourself.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.810
Hey! You know nothing about me.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.105
I know enough.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.066
And I know privilege when I see it.

31:01.902 --> 31:06.447
You may think you earned your strength,
but you had power the day you were born.

31:07.740 --> 31:10.952
Before the dragons. Before the chi.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.497
You have the ability to change the world
without getting anybody hurt.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.959
These people won't be stopped that way.

31:18.751 --> 31:21.129
You're taking the war
to the ones at the bottom, is that it?

31:22.213 --> 31:25.758
If I were in your shoes, I'd think twice
about using that thing on people

31:25.841 --> 31:27.427
who are trying to feed their families.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.058
This isn't gonna work out, it's obvious.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.060
Good luck, man.

31:35.810 --> 31:36.895
I'm sorry.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.528
[Danny sighs]

31:53.786 --> 31:55.580
I know you're having a rough time in here.

31:58.749 --> 32:00.043
Yeah.

32:02.378 --> 32:04.797
Misty says you'll be arraigned
within 24 hours...

32:06.424 --> 32:07.883
but we can figure this out.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.470
Has anyone approached you
about making a deal?

32:12.097 --> 32:13.264
I know a lawyer.

32:13.348 --> 32:16.392
There ain't no deal.
There were dead bodies in there.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.729
Looks like you were doing grunt work.

32:20.521 --> 32:21.814
Like you were helping to clean up.

32:21.897 --> 32:24.150
-Look, it doesn't matter.
-Of course it does.

32:25.986 --> 32:29.239
[scoffs] You don't take the blame
for something that's not yours.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.866
-Whoever hired you--
-Man, would you wake up?

32:33.034 --> 32:34.910
They're watching everything.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.330
They got eyes and ears all over.

32:37.413 --> 32:40.416
And the longer you talk to me,
the worse it looks.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.585
For the both of us.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.799
-Who's the guy in the white hat?
-Man, would you stay away?

32:49.592 --> 32:51.427
He is next-level dangerous.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.431
-So am I.
-[scoffs]

32:58.309 --> 32:59.310
Is this the Hand?

33:05.316 --> 33:06.359
You wanna help me?

33:09.279 --> 33:12.073
My mom, she lives at 555 Edgecombe.

33:13.741 --> 33:15.243
Take her some lotto tickets.

33:16.619 --> 33:17.745
Tell her they're from me.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.998
Cole, just tell me what you know.

33:21.499 --> 33:24.960
Scratch-off. Those are her favorite,
all right? Just do it.

33:25.045 --> 33:28.214
Tell her that they're from me.
Tell her that I'm thinking about her.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.841
-You can trust me.
-I do.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.719
Tell her I'm sorry.

33:41.352 --> 33:42.728
[Colleen sighs]

33:43.854 --> 33:46.524
Looks like that big guy
made quite an impression, huh?

33:49.402 --> 33:52.488
I am glad that you two
didn't end up in a fist fight.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.076
'Cause I'm not sure
that this place would survive it.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.703
[chuckles softly]

34:02.665 --> 34:03.916
What if he's right?

34:05.168 --> 34:06.252
About what?

34:07.045 --> 34:11.006
The Fist is one way to win this war,
but I do have others.

34:12.383 --> 34:15.511
Yeah... and you've tried 'em.

34:17.012 --> 34:19.390
They're the Hand, you can't just buy 'em.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.850
I'm not talking about money.

34:21.809 --> 34:24.895
I have connections, access.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.066
He doesn't understand
what we're really up against.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.526
He doesn't get how dangerous they are.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.944
I know, but...

34:33.488 --> 34:35.198
why am I fighting street-level operatives

34:35.281 --> 34:37.617
when I have the power
to go right to the top?

34:39.452 --> 34:41.871
Because, Danny, you...

34:44.207 --> 34:45.458
You're not a businessman.

34:46.584 --> 34:47.585
I know.

34:49.044 --> 34:50.338
But my father was.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.717
I know, but you are a fighter.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.469
A warrior.

34:56.552 --> 34:59.347
That's what you know.
That's... that's what's in your heart.

34:59.930 --> 35:02.350
And a good warrior uses
every tool at his disposal.

35:03.934 --> 35:06.896
I own 51% of a major corporation.

35:10.358 --> 35:11.942
I've got to try this another way.

35:20.075 --> 35:22.662
Hello? This is Danny Rand.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.080
[indistinct chatter]

35:29.084 --> 35:30.753
[woman] Welcome back, Mr. Rand.

35:30.836 --> 35:33.381
Mr. Meachum mentioned you had
business to take care of abroad.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.592
Uh, yeah. That's what brings me here.
Where is Ward?

35:36.676 --> 35:37.927
On a business trip himself.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.680
Perhaps we could schedule
something for next month?

35:40.763 --> 35:42.640
I, uh, don't have time for that.

35:42.723 --> 35:45.143
Well, unfortunately,
that's the earliest he'll be available.

35:45.226 --> 35:48.521
There was an organization
that did business with us last year.

35:48.604 --> 35:51.941
-We did lots of business. [chuckles]
-Yeah, they call themselves the Hand.

35:53.984 --> 35:58.864
-You need help spelling that?
-Look, whatever you heard, it's true.

35:58.948 --> 36:02.285
I know you're scared,
but we can't leave until you help us.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.705
-Help you how?
-[Colleen] We tailed 'em.

36:05.788 --> 36:09.250
We tracked 'em to São Paulo.
Berlin. Moscow.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.961
They set up shell companies, worldwide.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.464
We think they're doing
something here in New York.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.048
[Danny] We need you to help us find it.

36:20.511 --> 36:24.349
-São Paulo, Berlin and Moscow?
-Uh-huh.

36:25.015 --> 36:26.100
Anywhere else?

36:26.851 --> 36:30.355
-Uh, Paris, Miami...
-Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

36:31.063 --> 36:34.567
I'm cross-referencing short-term holdings
through those cities.

36:36.736 --> 36:40.906
Two hundred exist in the overlap.
Three of them shut down last year.

36:41.824 --> 36:42.908
What does that mean?

36:42.992 --> 36:45.745
Not much, except that they
were shut down on the same day.

36:45.828 --> 36:50.291
Before they closed, they all made deposits
into one place here in New York.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.252
I just need a name.

36:52.335 --> 36:55.463
Um... Midland Circle Financial.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.965
I remember that name.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.886
Ward gave us a list of places
to cease doing business with.

37:01.969 --> 37:03.304
[Colleen] It must be the Hand.

37:04.555 --> 37:06.891
I'll get you the address
from the directory.

37:06.974 --> 37:07.975
Thank you.

37:14.106 --> 37:17.277
-[sighs]
-We hit tonight. After hours.

37:18.278 --> 37:19.279
No.

37:20.530 --> 37:21.989
There's another way to attack.

37:24.284 --> 37:25.743
And I gotta do this alone.

37:29.079 --> 37:30.706
-Gorgeous, isn't it?
-[Jessica] Mmm.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.626
Like all of our projects,
it was built with sustainability in mind.

37:33.709 --> 37:37.046
-Yeah, I am super into that.
-I'm glad, Ms. Asher.

37:37.129 --> 37:40.675
Now, why don't you tell me
what you envisioned for your company's--

37:40.758 --> 37:42.468
-Communal workspace.
-Ah.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.305
Um, I mean, we're gonna need a juice bar.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.097
-Of course.
-Uh, standing desks.

37:47.181 --> 37:50.851
You know those bouncy balls that people
sit on that some people find annoying?

37:50.935 --> 37:55.105
I think it should be modern
and high-tech, but also so simple.

37:55.189 --> 37:57.567
A pragmatic utopia.

37:57.650 --> 38:00.945
Yes. Oh, my God. Can I quote that?

38:01.028 --> 38:02.488
Don't answer. I'm gonna quote that.

38:02.572 --> 38:06.200
[chuckles] Here is a property
I worked on last year in Midtown.

38:07.785 --> 38:08.786
Huh.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.996
Is there anything more recent?

38:11.080 --> 38:14.375
-I'm sorry?
-Anything from this year?

38:14.459 --> 38:17.962
-Not that I've done.
-Mmm. [smacks lips]

38:18.045 --> 38:20.965
How about any other architect
in your firm?

38:21.716 --> 38:23.843
Just because it's really important
for our brand

38:23.926 --> 38:26.596
that we're not only on the cutting edge,
but we are the cutting edge.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.432
Yes, but...

38:30.850 --> 38:32.602
can you keep a secret?

38:33.644 --> 38:35.688
I am the face of discretion.

38:35.771 --> 38:39.274
[takes deep breath]
I can show you our most recent work.

38:40.275 --> 38:44.238
A building in Hell's Kitchen,
designed by my colleague John Raymond.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.157
-Wow.
-Midland Circle.

38:49.910 --> 38:54.206
And is that architect on the premises?
I would love to speak with him.

38:54.289 --> 38:57.877
No, he's... not. Not at the moment.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.463
And who were the clients?

39:00.546 --> 39:03.383
That's privileged information.
I'm sure you understand.

39:03.466 --> 39:07.345
Uh, but I do have another structure
that you might be interested in.

39:07.428 --> 39:09.430
One that we unveiled in Soho last winter.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.306
-If you just give me a minute?
-Great.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.449
[knocking on door]

39:30.368 --> 39:31.369
Hi.

39:33.328 --> 39:34.830
We met the other night.

39:35.956 --> 39:37.625
Oh, we didn't meet, son.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.587
God himself sent you.

39:42.254 --> 39:44.882
You don't have to hide anything from me.

39:46.341 --> 39:48.260
I know where Cole is.

39:49.219 --> 39:51.556
He's following in his brother's footsteps.

39:56.143 --> 39:57.520
[Dolores sighs]

39:57.603 --> 39:59.021
You know what kind of trouble
they were into?

39:59.104 --> 40:00.189
No.

40:01.106 --> 40:02.900
But I hear there are bodies.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.780
Don't sound like my son,
but I've been wrong before.

40:08.864 --> 40:11.742
I can't help but feel some shame,
to be honest.

40:12.702 --> 40:14.537
But ain't nothing I can do now.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.289
Except to pray.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.418
I believe in the power of prayer.

40:21.168 --> 40:22.462
My father made sure of it.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.630
But it might not be too late.

40:27.132 --> 40:29.009
Cole was working for some bad people.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.762
I'm going to stop 'em.

40:34.890 --> 40:38.102
May the Lord bless and keep you
for doing his work.

40:38.811 --> 40:40.980
-Only doing what's needed.
-Oh.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.025
You know, you're the opposite from my son.

40:45.735 --> 40:48.403
He can't admit
when he's done something wrong.

40:48.488 --> 40:51.198
You can't admit
when you done something right.

40:54.368 --> 40:57.497
Uh, Cole wanted me to bring these to you.

40:58.831 --> 41:00.290
They're lotto tickets.

41:01.584 --> 41:04.504
He said he wanted you to know
he was thinking about you.

41:04.587 --> 41:07.757
[chuckles] There is goodness in that boy.

41:07.840 --> 41:11.093
You know, he'd been bringin' me these
since he was eight years old?

41:11.176 --> 41:14.096
At first, I didn't know
how he was paying for them.

41:14.179 --> 41:17.517
And then I realized
he was using his lunch money.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.893
[both chuckle]

41:20.645 --> 41:24.482
He said it was worth it...
to keep the dream alive.

41:25.733 --> 41:28.277
How 'bout some cookies? Chocolate chip.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.740
Did he tell you I keep them?

41:33.991 --> 41:37.411
There's a... a box in there,
but it's too high up for me.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.373
Cole's always the one who does it.

42:05.022 --> 42:06.941
[phone ringing]

42:10.653 --> 42:11.654
Hello?

42:13.197 --> 42:14.323
Yes, this is she.

42:17.993 --> 42:20.370
What do you mean, some kind of accident?

42:22.915 --> 42:24.166
Oh.

42:33.425 --> 42:36.220
They say he was in his cell
when it happened.

42:38.305 --> 42:41.100
My... my baby. My baby...

42:41.892 --> 42:45.896
[crying] Oh, God, my baby!

42:45.980 --> 42:48.816
Oh, God, my baby!

42:48.899 --> 42:51.569
Oh, my babies!

42:51.652 --> 42:54.947
All my... All my babies is gone!

42:55.698 --> 42:59.619
All my babies is gone!

43:06.626 --> 43:07.752
[thudding]

43:28.731 --> 43:30.024
[man grunting]

43:36.739 --> 43:40.159
[panting] Where's the Fist?

43:41.076 --> 43:42.077
[grunts]

44:03.348 --> 44:05.643
-[man] Name, please.
-Daniel Rand, of Rand Enterprises.

44:05.726 --> 44:09.438
-Here to see?
-The CEOs of Midland Circle Financial.

44:09.521 --> 44:12.733
-Are they expecting you?
-[chuckles softly] Not like this.

44:17.237 --> 44:18.280
Right this way.

44:38.968 --> 44:40.469
My name is Danny Rand.

44:41.470 --> 44:43.263
Last year, you illegally transferred

44:43.347 --> 44:47.685
$243 million worth of assets
through my family's company.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.270
And you thought you got away with it.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.107
But I know who you are.

44:54.608 --> 44:58.112
You killed my parents, attacked my home.

44:59.363 --> 45:02.532
You're the Hand.
And I'm gonna make sure...

45:03.617 --> 45:04.701
[Alexandra] Mr. Rand.

45:05.786 --> 45:09.456
I appreciate your candor.
And your passion.

45:09.539 --> 45:12.542
And I must say,
considering what I've heard about you,

45:12.626 --> 45:15.963
you seem much more disciplined
than I anticipated.

45:16.964 --> 45:20.384
-[Danny] And who are you?
-I'm in charge.

45:20.467 --> 45:22.970
But, please, go on.

45:23.053 --> 45:25.305
You were telling us
what you were going to do.

45:35.315 --> 45:36.316
[sighs]

45:37.317 --> 45:38.903
-Murdock!
-We need to leave now.

45:38.986 --> 45:41.696
If you grab me like that again,
I'll punch you so hard, you'll see.

45:41.781 --> 45:43.365
-I've been here before.
-Why are following me?

45:43.448 --> 45:46.243
-And you're in serious danger.
-[scoffs] What kind of lawyer are you?

45:46.326 --> 45:48.745
This case you took, it's leading you
toward something truly sinister.

45:48.829 --> 45:51.331
Okay, you are the most full of shit lawyer
I've ever met,

45:51.415 --> 45:53.667
and I think we should appreciate
the magnitude of that statement.

45:53.750 --> 45:55.920
-Let's talk about this somewhere else.
-Let's talk about it never.

45:57.671 --> 46:00.257
Unless you wanna tell me
how a blind man moves the way you do.

46:01.633 --> 46:03.928
-Excuse me?
-I have pictures, asshole.

46:06.263 --> 46:07.347
[Jessica grunts]

46:09.016 --> 46:12.561
Rand Enterprises has put together
a case to take you down.

46:13.938 --> 46:18.692
Extortion, narcotics, human trafficking...

46:18.775 --> 46:20.610
There's no end to what we'll uncover.

46:22.154 --> 46:23.155
And?

46:24.281 --> 46:27.742
[scoffs] And you can't hide anymore.

46:30.287 --> 46:34.458
-Does it look like we're hiding?
-[Danny] Behind Midland Circle Financial.

46:34.541 --> 46:36.293
Behind corporate shells,

46:36.376 --> 46:39.922
or street-level criminals who don't know
who they're working for. Yes.

46:40.005 --> 46:41.381
It's what you do.

46:42.842 --> 46:44.343
But I'm here to expose you.

46:47.221 --> 46:50.891
I am the Immortal Iron Fist,
weapon of K'un-Lun.

46:52.642 --> 46:55.270
-And I'm fulfilling my destiny.
-K'un-Lun.

46:57.272 --> 46:58.565
How is it these days?

47:01.986 --> 47:05.822
You're gonna lose everything.
Just like I did.

47:07.032 --> 47:09.451
You haven't lost everything, Mr. Rand.

47:10.494 --> 47:11.620
Not yet.

47:12.329 --> 47:13.747
-[gun cocks]
-[inhales sharply]

47:15.415 --> 47:17.001
[breathing heavily]

47:21.130 --> 47:22.965
[both grunting]

47:24.299 --> 47:25.592
[silenced gunshot]

47:26.218 --> 47:27.887
-What are you doing?
-Gunshot.

47:28.803 --> 47:29.889
-Where?
-In the penthouse.

47:29.972 --> 47:31.265
-How do you know that?
-I just do.

47:31.348 --> 47:33.183
This is exactly what I was trying
to avoid. I need that.

47:39.231 --> 47:41.984
I've crossed paths with Iron Fists before,

47:42.067 --> 47:45.612
but this is different,
because this time...

47:48.615 --> 47:49.741
I won't kill you.

47:54.329 --> 47:56.665
No use using her for protection.

47:56.748 --> 47:59.126
They will rip right through her
to get to you.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.302
[all grunting]

48:56.516 --> 48:57.559
Come on!

48:59.686 --> 49:01.438
-[Danny] You?
-Me.

49:02.939 --> 49:04.149
[grunting]

49:07.361 --> 49:10.322
-So punching's okay now?
-[grunting]

49:10.405 --> 49:11.448
It's complicated.

49:12.366 --> 49:13.825
[grunting]

49:33.137 --> 49:34.471
[grunting]

49:38.433 --> 49:39.976
[elevator bell chimes]

49:41.603 --> 49:43.063
You look like an asshole.

49:43.147 --> 49:44.273
It's your scarf.

49:46.358 --> 49:47.609
[grunts]

49:50.945 --> 49:52.156
[both grunting]

49:54.033 --> 49:55.909
-[Luke] Jessica?
-Luke.

49:55.992 --> 49:57.744
-[Luke] How you been?
-Long story.

49:57.828 --> 49:59.538
[Danny] We have to get out of here.

49:59.621 --> 50:02.624
-Who's he?
-Longer story. Who's he?

50:02.708 --> 50:04.710
[Matt] Wait. There's someone else coming.

50:04.793 --> 50:05.877
Something else.

50:15.345 --> 50:17.139
[sighs] You know what to do.

50:31.653 --> 50:34.030
-[Matt] What is it?
-[Jessica] Oh, shit.

50:35.532 --> 50:37.909
-[Luke] Who's that?
-Bad news. We gotta go.

50:38.827 --> 50:39.828
Uh-oh!

50:41.330 --> 50:43.248
[all grunting]

50:46.668 --> 50:47.794
[man yells]

51:11.109 --> 51:12.194
Ah!

51:17.199 --> 51:18.200
[grunting]

51:57.364 --> 51:58.365
Ah!

52:01.243 --> 52:03.328
[Matt grunting and panting]

52:09.834 --> 52:10.835
Elektra?

52:24.224 --> 52:26.059
-[Danny grunts]
-[Elektra groans]

52:32.566 --> 52:34.067
[Matt panting]

52:39.198 --> 52:40.199
Come on.

52:48.122 --> 52:49.291
Who are you people?

52:51.167 --> 52:52.586
[elevator bell chimes]
