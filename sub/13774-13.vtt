WEBVTT

00:01.244 --> 00:06.015
No matter who you end up
with, I will still love you.

00:06.083 --> 00:09.618
Oh, Dre, Dre.

00:09.686 --> 00:11.120
Dre, Dre, Dre.

00:11.188 --> 00:12.121
Okay, that's enough.

00:12.189 --> 00:12.955
That's enough.

00:13.023 --> 00:14.523
Just don't want to let him go.

00:14.591 --> 00:15.458
Let it go. Let it go.

00:15.525 --> 00:17.126
I don't like
calling this "The Dre."

00:17.194 --> 00:18.227
This is "The Shiva," okay?

00:18.295 --> 00:19.935
It is "The Dre."

00:20.055 --> 00:24.537
Whatever you call it, just know that
in one week's time, it will not be yours.

00:24.657 --> 00:29.156
It will be mine, and I will tear
it down like a statue of Saddam Hussein..

00:29.276 --> 00:32.656
- Destroy it... - Hold on, buddy,
because you haven't won it yet.

00:32.776 --> 00:34.610
And yes, it is a total teardown,

00:34.730 --> 00:37.892
- but I have amazing plans to build it back up.
- A total tear down?

00:38.012 --> 00:41.244
- N... no, this is a work of art.
- Ok, enough, it's time for

00:41.364 --> 00:44.022
- our offerings to "The Shi-Dre".
- Ok, good.

00:44.142 --> 00:46.905
And I think we should start with
the Shivable contestants

00:47.025 --> 00:50.497
and I think, ladies before dickheads.

00:50.617 --> 00:52.184
- What if they're both?
- What you gonna do.

00:52.304 --> 00:54.795
That's nice, ladies before
dickheads. Go ahead.

00:54.915 --> 00:56.487
Shi-Dre, your hemorrhoid donut...

00:56.607 --> 00:59.512
- Ohhh!
- that you earned in Vegas

00:59.632 --> 01:01.687
when you made that hard drive

01:01.807 --> 01:04.170
- up Andre's back fields,
- Hm-hm, huh-huh-huh.

01:04.959 --> 01:08.535
May you sit comfortable for all
the rest of your years...

01:08.655 --> 01:13.620
Next, as an ode to your terrible
fashion sense Dre and Andre,

01:13.740 --> 01:15.297
I offer you the hat...

01:15.737 --> 01:20.143
- that you gave to me for Christmas.
- I wanted that.

01:20.517 --> 01:22.699
Ok, well, you know what? Forgive me
but I think that hat is pretty pimpin'.

01:22.819 --> 01:25.558
- Need I say more..
- Alright guys, I gotta admit

01:26.070 --> 01:28.876
I don't have an offering for The Dre,

01:28.996 --> 01:30.469
What I do have is a little gift

01:30.589 --> 01:32.273
for the previous owner of The Dre.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.595
Very thoughtful, Pete.

01:33.715 --> 01:36.186
So here's something to
commemorate the fact that you're

01:36.248 --> 01:38.023
probably gonna be in
last place and you suck.

01:38.091 --> 01:39.925
No, no, no, I don't want that.

01:39.993 --> 01:41.694
Why did you bring the
Sacko in my house?

01:41.761 --> 01:44.029
Because I wanted to introduce
him to his new home where he's

01:44.097 --> 01:47.208
gonna be spending the year next year
after you lose in the Sacko Bowl.

01:47.328 --> 01:48.982
I'm not gonna lose in the Sacko Bowl.

01:49.102 --> 01:50.187
I'm playing Taco.

01:50.307 --> 01:52.204
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:52.272 --> 01:53.753
You're going down, Dr. No Dick.

01:53.873 --> 01:55.776
I'm gonna be sitting
on that waiver wire.

01:55.896 --> 01:58.744
I'm gonna be studying the match-ups
and picking up free agents.

01:58.812 --> 02:00.679
I'm gonna burn your nipples, bitch.

02:00.747 --> 02:01.580
Well done, Taco. Nicely done!

02:01.648 --> 02:02.414
Who are you? Who are you?

02:02.482 --> 02:04.350
Since when do you care
about fantasy football?

02:04.417 --> 02:05.951
I just feel like caring right now.

02:06.019 --> 02:06.952
You are doing so good.

02:07.020 --> 02:07.686
Good job.

02:07.754 --> 02:08.721
But you know what?

02:08.788 --> 02:11.523
It is my last week with The Dre,
and I'm gonna cherish every

02:11.591 --> 02:12.591
single moment with it.

02:12.659 --> 02:16.519
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I will be in my bedroom.

02:16.639 --> 02:17.836
Oh...

02:18.182 --> 02:22.616
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:22.736 --> 02:23.902
This sucks.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.105
Look, at least you got Jenny
this year, all right?

02:26.172 --> 02:27.740
I mean, the girl is incredible.

02:27.807 --> 02:28.774
What is this?

02:28.842 --> 02:29.942
You're not happy for your wife?

02:30.010 --> 02:32.378
She's in the league for the
first year and she brings the

02:32.445 --> 02:33.746
team to the Shiva Bowl?

02:33.813 --> 02:36.682
I've been doing this thing for six years;
I've never been to the Shiva Bowl.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.217
And what if she wins this thing?

02:38.285 --> 02:41.720
I gotta stare at a trophy that
I've never won for an entire year.

02:41.788 --> 02:42.688
Holy shit.

02:42.756 --> 02:44.757
It's gonna say "Lady McArthurs"
at the bottom of it.

02:44.824 --> 02:45.691
I hate fantasy football.

02:45.759 --> 02:48.127
And it's the only thing
I ever really loved.

02:48.194 --> 02:49.295
Wow, you're out to sea, man.

02:49.362 --> 02:50.362
Oh, I love fantasy football.

02:50.430 --> 02:52.531
And I love being a future champion.

02:52.599 --> 02:53.465
Jesus.

02:53.533 --> 02:57.303
Only question I have, at the flex, do I
play Donald Brown or Stevie Breaston?

02:57.370 --> 02:58.404
No. No, no, no.

02:58.471 --> 03:00.205
Enough.
Enough with the questions.

03:00.273 --> 03:01.240
We're not giving you advice.

03:01.308 --> 03:02.241
No!

03:02.309 --> 03:03.742
You know what? You're right.

03:03.810 --> 03:06.111
Hey, barkeep, do I play Donald
Brown or Stevie Breaston?

03:06.179 --> 03:07.579
Look, look, he's the census taker.

03:07.647 --> 03:10.282
He's polling around everyone on the
planet asking 'em the same question.

03:10.350 --> 03:12.217
Are we talking about taking a census?

03:12.285 --> 03:13.452
I'll do one right now.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.553
Male? Check.

03:14.621 --> 03:16.588
Champion? Check.

03:16.656 --> 03:19.291
Anyone else residing in your home?

03:19.359 --> 03:20.626
Uh, yes, an amazing wife.

03:20.694 --> 03:23.595
We had sex this morning, then
she cooked me breakfast.

03:23.663 --> 03:26.899
And now she's gonna take care
of my kid all day. How's Jenny?

03:26.966 --> 03:29.168
What's she focused on these days?
Bye!

03:30.470 --> 03:31.687
Smartass Kermit.

03:31.807 --> 03:34.930
- So miserable.
- Look at him over there, look at that guy.

03:35.050 --> 03:36.634
What is he doing over there,
by the way?

03:36.951 --> 03:39.944
He's asking these guys about
Breaston versus Brown.

03:40.064 --> 03:41.523
He still wants to know,
he's polling them.

03:41.985 --> 03:44.410
Now he's saying that he is the
commissioner of this leak.

03:44.652 --> 03:47.174
- What an asshole.
- How can you hear this, you have dog ears?

03:47.294 --> 03:48.635
I'm reading his lips.

03:48.755 --> 03:51.757
Oh, oh, you're reading lips now.

03:51.825 --> 03:53.359
I'm sorry, when did I miss this?

03:53.426 --> 03:56.128
Look, it's been a very rough
fall for me, all right?

03:56.196 --> 03:58.430
Jenny's been spending most of
her time on the computer trying

03:58.498 --> 04:00.933
to win the Shiva, so we haven't
exactly heated it up in the

04:01.000 --> 04:04.169
boudoir, so I've been having to
take care of myself in the shower.

04:04.237 --> 04:06.171
You're not the first man to
masturbate in the shower.

04:06.239 --> 04:07.005
I understand.

04:07.073 --> 04:08.207
Why are you reading lips?

04:08.274 --> 04:12.144
Well, I have this phone that I
just downloaded all this filth

04:12.212 --> 04:15.447
on, and I bring it into the
shower and I turn the sound off,

04:15.515 --> 04:16.515
so I don't get caught.

04:16.583 --> 04:18.450
Still don't understand why
you have to read lips.

04:18.517 --> 04:21.220
'Cause if I don't know the
story, I can't keep it up.

04:21.286 --> 04:23.856
I'm a very verbally-stimulated person.

04:23.923 --> 04:25.691
I need to know, like how
good she needs it, why he's

04:25.759 --> 04:26.525
delivering that pizza there.

04:26.593 --> 04:27.359
Plot points.

04:27.427 --> 04:29.328
Wow. That's all I'm
gonna say for now.

04:29.396 --> 04:30.996
I want to show you something outside.

04:31.064 --> 04:31.864
You're going to like this.

04:31.931 --> 04:32.698
Come on, get your coat.

04:32.766 --> 04:34.400
Is the nature of our
relationship about to change?

04:34.467 --> 04:35.634
No. Come on. Get your coat.

04:35.702 --> 04:36.735
All right, check it out.

04:36.803 --> 04:37.636
New car.

04:37.704 --> 04:39.371
Don't touch the cop car, all right?

04:39.439 --> 04:40.205
You get in trouble for that.

04:40.273 --> 04:41.039
It's not a cop car.

04:41.107 --> 04:42.241
It's my car. I bought it.

04:42.308 --> 04:43.542
This is not your car.

04:43.610 --> 04:44.543
This is a police officer's car.

04:44.611 --> 04:45.477
No, it's not.

04:45.545 --> 04:46.412
It's a Crown Vic.

04:46.479 --> 04:47.246
It's a normal car.

04:47.313 --> 04:48.080
A what?

04:48.148 --> 04:48.914
A Crown Vic.

04:48.982 --> 04:49.748
Crown Vic?

04:49.816 --> 04:51.517
I thought they were
just called cop cars.

04:51.584 --> 04:53.218
I didn't even know it had a name.

04:53.286 --> 04:54.546
Yes, sometimes they're
used as cop cars.

04:54.666 --> 04:56.356
- You bought this car?
- Yeah, I got a great deal on it.

04:56.476 --> 04:58.371
Well, did it come with a
mustache and a bad attitude?

04:58.491 --> 04:59.094
Very funny.

04:59.214 --> 05:01.519
Well, did you at least get two
divorces and a softball team?

05:01.639 --> 05:03.283
Not a cop car. Normal car.

05:03.403 --> 05:06.166
Oh, hey, Cagney and Lacey.

05:06.286 --> 05:07.690
How you guys doing?

05:08.000 --> 05:12.905
You guys off to solve crimes in
pleated slacks and lady Rockports?

05:13.517 --> 05:17.943
I think that starting Lee Evans against
Darrelle Revis is a huge, huge mistake.

05:18.011 --> 05:19.199
I disagree.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.206
No, I'm just telling you.

05:20.326 --> 05:22.409
This team did well for me last week.

05:22.529 --> 05:23.905
It's going to do well
for me this week.

05:24.025 --> 05:25.295
You have to consider the match-ups.

05:25.415 --> 05:28.587
I understand your argument,
except I am in the Shiva Bowl,

05:28.655 --> 05:32.364
and you are not, so maybe there
is something to my theory of

05:32.724 --> 05:34.831
not tinkering with your team.

05:34.951 --> 05:36.462
Oh, God.

05:36.529 --> 05:37.696
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

05:37.764 --> 05:40.766
This is going to be the team that
I go into the Shiva Bowl with.

05:40.834 --> 05:42.758
Fine, I'm going to take a shower.

05:47.709 --> 05:48.809
Why-Why are you slowing down?

05:48.876 --> 05:51.284
You're driving under the speed limit.

05:51.404 --> 05:53.598
- What is your problem?
- Come on.

05:53.718 --> 05:56.231
- Go!
- All right, this is ridiculous.

05:57.215 --> 05:58.348
Oh, you, too?

05:58.416 --> 06:00.061
Really? I'm not a cop!

06:00.185 --> 06:01.418
Okay, it's a Crown Victoria!

06:01.486 --> 06:02.886
Jesus Christ, people.

06:02.954 --> 06:05.723
No, don't pull...
I'm not a cop, all right?

06:05.790 --> 06:06.590
I don't have a mustache.

06:06.658 --> 06:09.827
I don't wear polyester pants, and
I've only been divorced once.

06:09.894 --> 06:10.728
35 miles an hour.

06:10.795 --> 06:11.962
35 miles an hour.

06:12.030 --> 06:15.466
Do you have any idea how infuriating it
is to actually drive the speed limit?

06:15.533 --> 06:16.467
Have you done this before?

06:16.534 --> 06:17.334
No. Never.

06:17.402 --> 06:19.236
It took me 30 extra minutes
to get home from work.

06:19.304 --> 06:21.238
I'm thinking about
going the other way.

06:21.306 --> 06:22.339
Why not just embrace it?

06:22.407 --> 06:23.440
I'll get a siren.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.274
I'll get a uniform..

06:24.342 --> 06:26.977
Good idea, impersonating
a cop, I like that.

06:27.045 --> 06:28.746
That would actually be a step
up for you professionally.

06:28.813 --> 06:30.981
By the way, guys, hide all your weed.

06:31.049 --> 06:31.982
There's a cop car out back.

06:32.050 --> 06:33.917
Not...

06:33.985 --> 06:35.619
Can I have a Bud Lite, please?

06:35.687 --> 06:36.453
Oh, there he is.

06:36.521 --> 06:37.521
What's up, meat?

06:37.589 --> 06:39.523
You ready for this weekend, huh?

06:39.591 --> 06:40.824
You're going down.

06:40.892 --> 06:44.094
I'm going to win the Sacko and
I'm going to win your apartment.

06:44.162 --> 06:45.929
My apartment is not part of the deal.

06:45.997 --> 06:46.764
That's what I was told.

06:46.831 --> 06:47.598
It is.

06:47.665 --> 06:48.432
Yeah, it is.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.266
No, it's not.

06:49.334 --> 06:50.100
That was part of the bet.

06:50.168 --> 06:51.869
Did any of you guys get food
poisoning from that food at my

06:51.936 --> 06:52.703
house the other day?

06:52.771 --> 06:53.537
No.

06:53.605 --> 06:54.438
No. Why?

06:54.506 --> 06:56.673
I've been puking my guts
up the last two days.

06:56.741 --> 06:58.776
I brought a bunch of leftovers
home; I've been eating

06:58.843 --> 07:00.010
nothing but that, and I'm fine.

07:00.078 --> 07:00.778
Sucks.

07:00.845 --> 07:02.446
I just can't catch a break.

07:02.514 --> 07:05.382
I mean this entire fall has
been total shit for me.

07:05.450 --> 07:06.383
Started in Vegas. Right?

07:06.451 --> 07:08.385
Then I started losing all those games.

07:08.453 --> 07:10.854
My trade with Taco, which
was a total disaster.

07:10.922 --> 07:14.103
- Yeah! - And now, I'm out of the Shiva
and in the Sacko.

07:14.223 --> 07:15.946
Andre, you got a flat tire.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.814
Great, great.

07:17.934 --> 07:20.336
You see what's happening here?
Shiva is punishing you.

07:20.456 --> 07:23.661
- Shiva is not punishing me.
- No no no no.

07:23.781 --> 07:26.169
The trophy formerly known
as Shiva.

07:26.289 --> 07:28.522
- You mean The Dre.
- That's the problem.

07:28.642 --> 07:32.492
- You've been worshiping false idols, Andre.
- And nothing is falser than you.

07:32.612 --> 07:34.612
- You're cursed.
- I'm not cursed.

07:34.732 --> 07:36.901
- No, I am not.
- I think you have the DRAIDS.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.966
- You've got DRAIDS.
- I don't have DRAIDS.

07:39.086 --> 07:41.226
- Ooh, you've got DRAIDS.
- I think you might.

07:41.346 --> 07:43.776
- I don't have DRAIDS.
- You know what? Full blown DRAIDS.

07:43.896 --> 07:46.062
I got the championships coming up, I do not
want to anger Shiva any more. I'm outta here.

07:46.379 --> 07:49.870
- But wait... - Yeah, you know what?
I got the game on the line, too. Kevin, let's get out of here.

07:49.990 --> 07:52.309
I'm not contagious.

07:53.283 --> 07:55.680
Oh, Jenny, may the best man
win this week.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.473
Ruxin, you know you're only here because
I drafted your team for you.

07:58.736 --> 08:00.343
I don't remember it that way.

08:00.463 --> 08:03.751
- Really?
- Really.

08:03.871 --> 08:06.070
- Hmm. - All I know is that I got a killer
lineup and I'm gonna get an amazing performance

08:06.411 --> 08:08.891
out of either Donald Brown
or Steve Breaston.

08:09.011 --> 08:11.884
Are you trying to get me to help you
with your lineup right now?

08:12.212 --> 08:15.842
You are unbelievably horrible, Ruxin.

08:15.962 --> 08:18.555
I cannot wait to obliterate you.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.858
And you are going to lose,
you're going to go home, and you

08:20.925 --> 08:22.559
are just going to savage your pud.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.560
Very classy.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.561
Ah, thank you.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.017
You know, I am so glad
Sofia's not in this league

08:27.137 --> 08:29.552
because you are just
a brute of a wife.

08:29.623 --> 08:30.760
I am a great wife.

08:30.804 --> 08:34.678
Oh, yeah, because every great wife
completely emasculates her husband.

08:34.721 --> 08:35.717
For shame, Jenny.

08:35.784 --> 08:36.717
Babe, you ready to go?

08:36.785 --> 08:38.038
- Get back in the car, Kevin.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:38.158 --> 08:38.772
Okay.

08:38.892 --> 08:40.851
You guys aren't seriously
leaving, are you?

08:40.971 --> 08:41.986
- Ugh! DRAIDS!
- What?

08:42.094 --> 08:43.027
Stay away.

08:43.095 --> 08:44.403
You know, he just
tried to kiss my ass.

08:44.523 --> 08:48.432
Oh, you just wait till this weekend; I'm
gonna get all up in that ass.

08:48.552 --> 08:49.300
Oh, come on.

08:50.126 --> 08:51.739
Ruxin, it is Andre.

08:51.859 --> 08:54.696
This is my 14th message
I'm leaving for you.

08:54.764 --> 08:56.540
Call me back!

08:56.660 --> 08:58.008
It's not a real curse.

08:58.128 --> 08:59.616
I don't have DRAIDS.

08:59.736 --> 09:02.280
All right, and if I did, this
is not the way you should treat

09:02.400 --> 09:04.150
someone with DRAIDS.

09:04.270 --> 09:07.560
By the way, if you're the one who sent
me that quilt, you're an asshole.

09:07.796 --> 09:09.778
Boom! Murder!

09:13.383 --> 09:14.616
Can I get the knife now?

09:14.684 --> 09:15.617
Is that cool?

09:15.685 --> 09:18.053
When are we gonna
fight with the knife?

09:18.121 --> 09:20.165
Ugh! Bam! Bam!

09:20.285 --> 09:22.562
Oh! Shit!

09:22.742 --> 09:23.842
Get out of here.

09:23.910 --> 09:25.043
What are you doing here, man?

09:25.111 --> 09:26.044
Look at you!

09:26.112 --> 09:27.279
Hey. Oh, you're so gross.

09:27.347 --> 09:28.158
Look at you. You look great.

09:28.278 --> 09:29.142
How are you, buddy?

09:29.262 --> 09:30.758
I'm good.
How are you doing, Raffi?

09:30.878 --> 09:31.825
Fighting girls, man.

09:31.945 --> 09:32.739
Okay.

09:32.859 --> 09:35.197
Most of the people I get in fights
with, to be honest with you, are women.

09:35.317 --> 09:35.987
Really?

09:36.107 --> 09:38.791
So, uh, I'm kind of learning
the defenses, uh, weak spots.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.052
- I bet.
- It's erotic.

09:40.172 --> 09:42.391
- Yeah. Oh.
- How are the guys?

09:42.511 --> 09:43.332
How's Brian?

09:43.452 --> 09:44.787
Kevin's good. Kevin's good.

09:44.907 --> 09:45.457
Yeah. Tall guy?

09:45.577 --> 09:48.585
Pete's, uh, actually, uh,
currently pretending to be a cop.

09:48.705 --> 09:50.705
Oh, man, I did that for a while.
Ooh.

09:50.825 --> 09:52.971
- Really? What...?
- Yeah. After September 11.

09:53.039 --> 09:55.225
- Should have known.
- Put a cop's uniform on.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.597
Got crazy pussy.

09:56.717 --> 09:58.043
- Really?
- Yeah. I never forget.

09:58.111 --> 10:01.768
Uh, now I'm just, like, learning to
fight girls, crushing in my league.

10:01.888 --> 10:03.722
Yeah, I heard you were doing
really well in your league.

10:03.842 --> 10:05.909
Are you kidding, dude?
I'm in the championships right now.

10:06.029 --> 10:07.452
I heard that. Yeah.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.990
It's amazing.
I'm gonna win, and it's gonna be sweet.

10:09.110 --> 10:10.181
What's the trophy for you guys?

10:10.301 --> 10:11.234
Oh, we don't have a trophy.

10:11.354 --> 10:12.163
What do you guys win?

10:12.283 --> 10:15.276
Uh, the winner gets to punch the
loser in the face as hard as he can.

10:15.396 --> 10:16.717
Is everybody playing by that rule?

10:16.837 --> 10:18.571
Yeah.
It's a dominance league.

10:18.691 --> 10:22.615
All right, look, I actually came 'cause
I bizarrely want your advice on something.

10:22.735 --> 10:23.988
I can tell something's bothering you.

10:24.108 --> 10:25.759
Yeah, well, I got a quantry.

10:25.879 --> 10:27.034
- Don't know what that means.
- Okay.

10:27.154 --> 10:28.904
The problem is I don't know who to play.

10:28.947 --> 10:31.088
I got Donald Brown, Stevie
Breaston for the flex, you know?

10:31.208 --> 10:34.636
And I ask one guy...he tells me one thing;
I talk to another guy... he tells me another thing.

10:34.756 --> 10:36.617
It's, like, Donald Brown
or Stevie Breaston.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.156
I just feel like I'm getting
more and more confused.

10:38.276 --> 10:40.414
Whoa, dude.
You're way overthinking this.

10:40.534 --> 10:43.848
You got to stop using this, start using
what's in here and what's in here.

10:43.968 --> 10:45.614
You got to just jerk it out.

10:46.625 --> 10:49.405
Okay, I'm not doing that, all right?
Dude, if you don't jerk the answer out...

10:49.525 --> 10:51.691
I just need to think
about it and figure it out.

10:52.134 --> 10:54.634
Hey! Thinking is pointless,
like motorcycle helmets.

10:54.754 --> 10:55.826
Motorcycle helmets are pointless?

10:55.946 --> 10:58.723
There is no medical proof that
motorcycle helmets save lives.

10:58.843 --> 11:00.843
How many friends have you
lost in motorcycle accidents?

11:00.963 --> 11:02.395
- Nine..
- Okay.

11:02.515 --> 11:04.575
But not one of them was
to a massive head trauma.

11:04.695 --> 11:06.853
All of them died from
massive spine trauma.

11:06.973 --> 11:09.015
- The answer... - Mm-hmm.
- ...is inside your body.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.294
You got to get it out.

11:10.414 --> 11:12.521
I'm gonna take you to the brink, bro.
You ready?

11:12.641 --> 11:13.297
No.

11:14.370 --> 11:17.470
Oh, God! Oh! Aah! Aah!

11:17.590 --> 11:18.462
Come on.

11:18.582 --> 11:19.267
What are you doing?

11:19.387 --> 11:22.117
I don't know what the technical term is,
but Dirty Randy calls it the stuffed pepper.

11:22.237 --> 11:22.981
Do you feel it?

11:23.101 --> 11:25.574
All I feel is your sack
against my shoulder.

11:25.694 --> 11:26.877
You're welcome, bro.

11:26.997 --> 11:28.235
You got to stop thinking now, bro.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.272
I'm gonna stop breathing in a second.

11:30.392 --> 11:31.256
Good. That's the point.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.301
Donald Brown.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.723
Nice work, buddy.
Good workout.

11:41.357 --> 11:42.742
Were you hard?

11:42.862 --> 11:43.962
Yeah.

11:44.294 --> 11:47.773
The concept of extinguishing a human
life really gets me aroused.

11:47.893 --> 11:48.965
Jesus, Raffi.

11:49.085 --> 11:50.059
It's called a murder boner.

11:50.179 --> 11:51.041
Oh, God.

11:54.925 --> 11:56.510
These sandwiches are awesome.

11:56.630 --> 11:58.361
Mm. I know.
They're great, right?

11:58.429 --> 11:59.595
Mm.

11:59.663 --> 12:02.207
Best part is, I got 'em for free
from the sub shop down the street.

12:02.327 --> 12:04.682
Huge supporters of
the Chicago P.D.

12:05.061 --> 12:06.360
You're a cop?

12:06.837 --> 12:08.911
Taco, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not a cop.

12:09.213 --> 12:10.573
They just think I'm a cop.

12:10.641 --> 12:11.819
Okay, 'cause you can't arrest me.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.343
You gave me a sandwich.
This is entrapment.

12:13.463 --> 12:15.108
I'm not going to arrest you.

12:15.228 --> 12:16.559
Check this out. Watch this.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.397
Miss?

12:22.302 --> 12:24.086
Can you come here for
a second, please?

12:26.023 --> 12:29.480
So, I'm not sure you're aware, but jaywalking
is illegal in the city of Chicago.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.042
Oh, I'm so sorry, Officer.

12:32.162 --> 12:35.865
I-I didn't even know... Okay.
Let me see your license, please.

12:35.933 --> 12:37.100
I just moved here.

12:37.167 --> 12:38.267
Okay.

12:38.335 --> 12:40.670
- Oh. Calleigh. From Texas.
- Yeah.

12:40.738 --> 12:41.576
All right.

12:41.696 --> 12:44.374
I assume this is not your
current address, then.

12:44.441 --> 12:45.608
Actually, no.

12:45.676 --> 12:47.059
I'm staying at one of my friend's.

12:47.179 --> 12:49.651
Well, is there a good place that,
uh, that I could contact you?

12:49.771 --> 12:51.418
I work at the coffee
shop down the street.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.178
You-You could find me there.

12:53.298 --> 12:54.245
Okay, good.

12:54.365 --> 12:55.700
Am I gonna get a ticket, Officer?

12:55.820 --> 12:57.684
I'm gonna go ahead and let you
off this time, all right?

12:57.804 --> 12:59.174
- Oh, thank you so much.
- No problem.

12:59.294 --> 13:01.017
But I got my eye on you, alright?

13:01.137 --> 13:03.376
- Okay.
- And maybe I'll stop by the coffee shop.

13:03.496 --> 13:05.718
- Okay, awesome. - Alright.
- Bye. - Take care.

13:06.741 --> 13:08.584
I gotta get one of these cars.

13:08.826 --> 13:11.098
You know, I don't really think
you're force material, Taco.

13:16.019 --> 13:17.128
Hey, Jenny, what's going on?

13:17.248 --> 13:18.333
I have a quick question for you:

13:18.453 --> 13:20.745
where is that sausage place
that Kevin loves?

13:20.865 --> 13:23.375
I'm on Sazin and First and I swear
it was right here.

13:23.495 --> 13:25.911
Why are you looking for a sausage
place on Sunday morning?

13:26.031 --> 13:27.519
You should be setting your lineup.

13:28.147 --> 13:30.592
Pete, my lineup is fine. It's set,

13:30.712 --> 13:32.588
locked, I am ready to go.

13:32.708 --> 13:34.047
Don't get cocky.

13:34.167 --> 13:35.985
Look, I know I haven't been
the best wife lately,

13:36.105 --> 13:37.620
and I feel really bad for Kevin.

13:37.740 --> 13:39.342
So I thought I would do something

13:39.462 --> 13:42.419
- very nice and very wifey today.
- Really?

13:42.769 --> 13:45.430
Like... let Kevin help you with your lineup?

13:45.550 --> 13:47.272
I said I was gonna do something nice,

13:47.392 --> 13:49.472
not something stupid.
My lineup is set.

13:49.592 --> 13:52.105
Alright, look, that place you're
looking for, just go two blocks east.

13:52.225 --> 13:53.061
You're almost there.

13:53.181 --> 13:56.300
And by the way, please destroy
Ruxin for us this weekend.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.991
I got it in the bag.

13:58.111 --> 14:00.403
I hope you're right.
Get it done, lady.

14:03.386 --> 14:05.247
Well, would you look at you?

14:05.367 --> 14:06.620
Hello.

14:10.084 --> 14:11.359
Can I help you find anything?

14:11.920 --> 14:14.163
Oh, uh, no, thanks.
I'm just browsing.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.646
Okay.

14:16.173 --> 14:19.802
Actually, what is the largest
trophy that you make?

14:19.870 --> 14:21.804
- Jenny.
- Aah!

14:21.872 --> 14:23.086
- Hey.
- Andre.

14:23.206 --> 14:24.142
What are you doing here?

14:24.262 --> 14:25.583
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

14:25.703 --> 14:29.087
Oh, I just... I was in the neighbor...
Dr. Nowzik, I, uh,

14:29.207 --> 14:30.556
have your replica here.

14:30.676 --> 14:33.811
It's made to the exact same
specifications as your last trophy.

14:33.931 --> 14:35.318
- It's a complete match.
- I got, I got it.

14:35.927 --> 14:37.756
You made another Dre?

14:38.254 --> 14:41.150
I'm, I'm gonna miss it.

14:41.483 --> 14:42.605
You're cursed.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.060
I'm not cursed.

14:44.180 --> 14:45.637
And now I am cursed.

14:45.757 --> 14:46.828
Oh!

14:46.948 --> 14:48.754
You gave me DRAIDS.

14:48.990 --> 14:51.415
Yeah, probably.

14:52.773 --> 14:53.826
Want to get some lunch?

14:53.946 --> 14:54.976
No.

14:56.314 --> 14:59.187
I shouldn't, I really...
No, I have to, that's it.

14:59.307 --> 15:00.213
It's about the match-ups.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.280
It's, it's practical.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.534
Babe, you cannot start Steve Johnson
against Darrelle Revis and the Jets.

15:04.654 --> 15:05.601
He's going to get blanketed.

15:05.721 --> 15:09.684
That's why I'm moving Steve Johnson
to the bench

15:09.919 --> 15:15.095
and moving to starting wide receiver
Percy Hoven.

15:15.622 --> 15:18.197
You're welcome, baby.
I just won you the Shiva Bowl.

15:19.473 --> 15:21.832
Now, off to the showers.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.328
Everybody needs to get a report.

15:28.117 --> 15:30.764
♪ Rock and roll
with my Johnson. ♪

15:30.884 --> 15:31.817
Whoa, hey!

15:31.937 --> 15:33.050
I have DRAIDS.

15:33.170 --> 15:36.242
- What?
- Oh, ugh, Kevin.

15:36.362 --> 15:37.547
- What?
- You have betrayed my trust.

15:37.614 --> 15:39.382
Babe, it's just a little bit of porn.

15:39.449 --> 15:43.797
- No one ever... - I don't care that
you are yanking it in a shower.

15:43.917 --> 15:47.814
Savage yourself all you want;
do not touch my lineup.

15:48.092 --> 15:51.975
Babe, I-I was doing what I
felt was right for the entire team,

15:52.095 --> 15:54.063
for the whole McArthur team.
I mean...

15:54.131 --> 15:55.411
this is the Shiva Bowl, babe.

15:55.531 --> 15:56.811
Are those our sandwich bags?

15:57.296 --> 15:58.584
Yeah.

15:58.704 --> 16:00.289
They work so good.

16:00.409 --> 16:02.088
My whole life is cursed.

16:03.419 --> 16:04.986
Is it weird if I finish?

16:09.670 --> 16:12.230
Maybe it's just
a bad dream, you know?

16:12.466 --> 16:13.754
It's not fair.

16:16.220 --> 16:19.977
♪ Shivakamini Somakandarkram Shiva...♪
Suck it!

16:20.476 --> 16:24.364
Babe, I am so sorry that I
tinkered with your lineup.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.186
- I should never have done that.
- You know what?

16:26.574 --> 16:28.362
No, it was my fault.

16:28.611 --> 16:32.535
I am the one who walked into
that DRAIDS-infected trophy shop,

16:32.603 --> 16:33.797
and I got the curse.

16:33.917 --> 16:38.671
I let my fantasy hubris get the
best of me, and now it's over.

16:38.791 --> 16:41.696
And I'm sorry you caught me
cranking one out in the shower.

16:41.816 --> 16:42.970
What... hold on.

16:43.090 --> 16:44.093
You don't apologize for that.

16:44.213 --> 16:46.102
I'm also sorry for jerking
off in your shower.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.455
Oh, my...
In our shower?

16:47.575 --> 16:48.494
You should apologize.

16:49.714 --> 16:52.338
There are so many people
that I need to thank.

16:52.643 --> 16:57.378
All of them happen to be named Ruxin,
but I didn't just appear here.

16:57.614 --> 17:02.014
The beautiful flower that you
see before you needed sunlight,

17:02.134 --> 17:06.762
needed soil, but most of all it
needed manure, and that's where

17:06.883 --> 17:11.698
you shit people came in, and as
your leader I love you as I will

17:11.818 --> 17:13.166
love all of my subjects.

17:13.512 --> 17:14.960
'Cause you're shit people.

17:15.805 --> 17:17.204
But you're my shit people.

17:18.021 --> 17:19.444
Beat you!

17:20.205 --> 17:21.467
Ah.

17:22.185 --> 17:24.247
Well...
I really hate him.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.771
Guys, guys, what about me?
Did I win?

17:26.891 --> 17:27.657
- No.
- No.

17:27.778 --> 17:29.131
So I didn't get the Sacko trophy?

17:29.251 --> 17:30.392
No, you're going to get The Sacko.

17:30.512 --> 17:31.167
So I won?

17:31.287 --> 17:32.941
No, you... can you...
oh, God.

17:33.061 --> 17:36.443
You lost, Andre won, but
that means you got it.

17:36.563 --> 17:37.607
You got the trophy.

17:37.727 --> 17:39.020
Why is Andre giving me the trophy?

17:39.140 --> 17:40.856
No, Andre's not giving you the trophy.

17:40.976 --> 17:41.785
So no one won?

17:41.905 --> 17:44.112
You get The Sacko.

17:44.232 --> 17:45.720
You, you will receive it.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.340
Yeah, but I don't want him
to just give it to me.

17:53.571 --> 17:54.505
Hello.

17:54.572 --> 17:57.608
Welcome to the home
that is curse-free.

17:57.675 --> 17:58.542
Oh, this is gonna be good.

17:58.610 --> 17:59.476
Ah, smell it, it's good.

17:59.544 --> 18:00.310
Smells great in here.

18:00.378 --> 18:01.144
So nice.

18:01.212 --> 18:02.446
Things are great.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.649
Oh, n-no, get that out of the house.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.951
That has an owner, and the
owner's name is Taco.

18:08.019 --> 18:08.952
It's not.

18:09.020 --> 18:09.953
No.

18:10.021 --> 18:11.788
Have you checked the scores recently?

18:11.856 --> 18:13.023
No, they were final.

18:13.091 --> 18:16.059
No, there was a recalc,
a recalculation.

18:16.127 --> 18:16.894
What do you mean?

18:16.961 --> 18:19.496
You have Joe Flac, and he had that
touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin.

18:19.564 --> 18:20.497
Uh-huh.

18:20.565 --> 18:22.866
Well, they went back and looked
at it, and they saw that

18:22.934 --> 18:26.203
Anquan Boldin was actually
behind Joe Flac.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.204
What does that mean?

18:27.272 --> 18:29.039
Well, that means it
wasn't a pass at all.

18:29.207 --> 18:32.676
It was technically a handoff,
therefore you don't get the six

18:32.744 --> 18:36.647
points for the touchdown, which
by my calculations puts you two

18:36.714 --> 18:40.417
points down to Taco, and
that score is final.

18:40.485 --> 18:42.319
I don't understand
anything he just said.

18:42.387 --> 18:46.545
All I know is that six points from Flacco
means you get The Sacko.

18:46.665 --> 18:47.834
From Taco.

18:47.954 --> 18:49.344
Funny. It's a joke.

18:49.464 --> 18:51.919
- I'm gonna check the scores.
- Check away, my friend.

18:52.155 --> 18:53.388
Oh, no.

18:53.727 --> 18:56.422
- Oh, yeah.
- It was final.

18:56.658 --> 18:58.126
First to worst.

18:58.246 --> 19:00.025
First to worst.

19:00.271 --> 19:02.156
First to worst.

19:02.276 --> 19:05.368
Let's get ready to Shivaaaa!

19:05.604 --> 19:08.679
Yay!

19:08.799 --> 19:10.217
I am the winner, of the chick pop.

19:10.337 --> 19:11.850
Hello my little lady,

19:11.970 --> 19:14.441
you ready to have a threesome
with me and my hand?

19:14.729 --> 19:16.891
No! No, I am keeping it.

19:17.011 --> 19:20.162
- Andre just give it up.
- Let me just review the stats

19:20.282 --> 19:23.350
- for a couple of days...
- Ok, every African dictator ever,

19:23.470 --> 19:26.430
- you lost the elections, now give up power.
- No.

19:27.054 --> 19:29.215
- It's mine.
- Andre, give it up.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.698
There's stuff one needs to do.

19:30.818 --> 19:33.328
What do you want, to go to Six Flags
with it? Jesus Christ! Gimme that.

19:33.448 --> 19:35.383
- Fifteen more minutes.
- Andre, come on.

19:35.503 --> 19:37.448
I'm gonna tear your goddamn head off.

19:37.910 --> 19:41.394
- Go go go. - Let's watch this shit.
- Coming.

19:41.983 --> 19:43.116
Give me the trophy.

19:43.739 --> 19:45.194
My name's already on it.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.007
No, it's mine.

19:47.127 --> 19:48.462
Give it to me.

19:48.582 --> 19:51.638
Andre, you've got another Dre.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.562
It's not the same.

19:59.864 --> 20:01.031
Holy shit.

20:01.099 --> 20:02.502
That was awesome.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.270
It's mine.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:10.390 --> 20:11.762
Excuse me, it's mine.

20:12.316 --> 20:13.231
How did it go right in?

20:13.351 --> 20:15.847
Wow, it pierced this like
it did Andre's asshole.

20:15.967 --> 20:17.566
Douche bag, this is yours?

20:17.686 --> 20:18.979
Yeah, it's mine. I won it.

20:19.099 --> 20:20.654
Look what you did to my car!

20:20.774 --> 20:22.594
Okay, we are so sorry.

20:22.714 --> 20:24.321
Let me just take this
trophy out of here.

20:24.441 --> 20:25.375
No, no, no, no, no.

20:25.495 --> 20:27.231
This is a crime scene.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.948
Look, here come the cops.

20:29.068 --> 20:31.011
- Seriously?
- All right.

20:32.412 --> 20:35.000
- What's the situation here?
- Look what they did to my car.

20:35.116 --> 20:35.949
They did this to your car?

20:36.017 --> 20:36.784
I want to press charges.

20:36.851 --> 20:38.452
You want to press charges
against these people?

20:38.520 --> 20:39.453
Everyone.

20:39.521 --> 20:40.287
You got it.

20:40.355 --> 20:42.222
Hey, you, you, you, you,
you, in the squad car.

20:42.290 --> 20:43.057
We're going downtown.

20:43.124 --> 20:43.891
Yes, Officer.

20:43.958 --> 20:44.725
Yes, sir.

20:44.793 --> 20:45.726
Okay.

20:45.794 --> 20:46.560
Stat, in the car.

20:46.628 --> 20:49.296
You, sir, hey, in the purple Barney
sweater, you're going to stay here.

20:49.364 --> 20:51.065
You wait for the next police
officer to come, okay?

20:51.132 --> 20:52.066
Really?

20:52.133 --> 20:53.067
Yeah.

20:53.134 --> 20:54.802
Really, is that how it's going to be?

20:54.869 --> 20:55.803
Yeah, yeah.

20:55.870 --> 20:56.637
All right.

20:56.705 --> 20:58.837
I'll go to jail, but I'm going
to jail as the league champion!

20:58.957 --> 21:00.729
Congratulations, Ruxin.

21:00.849 --> 21:03.083
Hey, asshole, second car's
coming for you, buddy.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.492
Well, there'd better be room
in there for two 'cause me and

21:05.612 --> 21:07.982
my girlfriend got a date tonight.

21:10.685 --> 21:13.387
I got to say, being saved by
Pete is the first good thing to

21:13.455 --> 21:17.539
happen to me in months, and now
with The Dre destroyed, maybe

21:17.659 --> 21:18.592
the curse of the DRAIDS is over.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.762
What about the curse of The
Sacko, my friend, huh?

21:21.830 --> 21:23.184
Damn it, I really wanted that trophy.

21:23.590 --> 21:25.674
Free at last, free at last.

21:25.794 --> 21:28.769
Oh, Shiva, I am free at last!

21:28.837 --> 21:29.770
Wow.

21:29.838 --> 21:32.062
Uh, did you just compare
yourself to Martin Luther King?

21:32.182 --> 21:33.361
Did he win his league?

21:33.481 --> 21:35.066
Wow, you're feeling good, aren't you?

21:35.186 --> 21:40.289
I feel great 'cause I'm a champion and I'm
here with my beautiful lady, my Shiva.

21:40.608 --> 21:42.257
But Shiva's a little naked today.

21:42.377 --> 21:43.926
That's why I got her this.

21:44.827 --> 21:46.757
It's already got your name on it.

21:46.877 --> 21:47.876
That's right, it does.

21:47.996 --> 21:49.493
Ruxin.

21:49.804 --> 21:51.131
Suck it!

21:51.504 --> 21:56.562
Let the unrelenting rein of Ruxin begin!

21:57.910 --> 21:59.672
Ha-ha-ha!

21:59.792 --> 22:03.613
Shivaaaakamini Somakandarkram Shiva!

22:05.180 --> 22:07.148
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

22:07.537 --> 22:09.075
I won the Shiva.

22:09.195 --> 22:10.516
The Dre is dead.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.396
Oh, my God!

22:13.516 --> 22:14.504
Is that a solar eclipse?

22:14.624 --> 22:16.749
Guys, was there supposed to
be a solar eclipse today?

22:16.869 --> 22:18.038
Not for months.

22:18.158 --> 22:19.548
This league is doomed.

22:19.668 --> 22:22.762
Ruxin has won.
It is the end of days!

22:22.882 --> 22:26.440
This is exactly how I picture
it when I'm masturbating,

22:26.560 --> 22:29.101
down to the fact you're all watching!

22:29.221 --> 22:32.668
The only difference is Andre's
wearing a stupid hat!

22:33.901 --> 22:35.120
That's the one.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.304
Put it on, so I can finish.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.884
Don't put it on, don't!

22:39.004 --> 22:40.339
Look, it's not stupid.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.057
Will Smith has the same one.

22:43.822 --> 22:53.864
