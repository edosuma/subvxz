WEBVTT

00:08.130 --> 00:10.000
DAD:
It's a great day, huh?GIRL: I know.

00:10.043 --> 00:11.000
DAD:
Yeah.

00:11.043 --> 00:12.086
Oh, hey, sweetie, look.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.000
It's the presidential
helicopter.

00:14.043 --> 00:16.043
Oh, cool.Yeah.

00:16.086 --> 00:18.521
Do you think Sasha and Malia
are in there?

00:18.565 --> 00:19.521
I bet they are.

00:19.565 --> 00:20.521
Hmm?
Sure.

00:20.565 --> 00:22.043
Here, let's
get a picture.

00:22.086 --> 00:23.217
Right there.

00:24.608 --> 00:27.217
I got the Washington Monument
in the background.

00:31.695 --> 00:34.086
I cannot believe we got
a picture of the helicopter.I know!

00:35.086 --> 00:36.347
Hold on. Wait.What...?

00:36.391 --> 00:38.217
Let me get a
picture of you.Okay.

00:38.260 --> 00:41.000
Okay, so let's see...

00:41.043 --> 00:42.217
How's that?

00:42.260 --> 00:44.043
Go down a little bit.

00:44.086 --> 00:44.956
We got 20 minutes till
the White House tour.

00:45.000 --> 00:45.956
I don't want
to be late.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.173
Okay, okay.

00:49.260 --> 00:51.043
Got it? Perfect.

00:51.086 --> 00:53.521
Okay, come on.Huh? Looks good.

00:54.521 --> 00:57.652
Hey, what's that?Huh?

00:57.695 --> 00:59.434
Let's see.

00:59.478 --> 01:01.521
It's a hat.
Yeah.

01:01.565 --> 01:04.782
It's a naval officer's hat.

01:04.826 --> 01:06.173
GIRL:
Cool.

01:09.217 --> 01:11.086
Sweetheart, why don't you stand
over there, okay?

01:11.130 --> 01:13.608
Oh, wait, you want
another picture? Here.No, no, no. No, it's okay.

01:13.652 --> 01:14.608
Just stand over there, sweetie.

01:14.652 --> 01:15.913
Okay.

02:02.130 --> 02:04.173
TONY: You gonna keep
it as a souvenir?

02:04.217 --> 02:05.347
Oh, yeah.

02:05.391 --> 02:08.086
I've got the perfect
place for it.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.043
Nice.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.173
Mm-hmm.

02:11.217 --> 02:13.086
Hey. We didn't want
to wait for you.

02:13.130 --> 02:16.130
I put your boy Sergei
Mishnev up on the wall.

02:16.173 --> 02:17.260
Oh.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.782
You okay, Tim?

02:18.826 --> 02:20.521
Yeah, I'm just tired.

02:20.565 --> 02:23.260
Didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.Oh?

02:23.304 --> 02:25.086
I'll tell you, maintaining
a long-distance relationship

02:25.130 --> 02:28.130
is really tough.
With Delilah in Dubai,

02:28.173 --> 02:30.434
her daytime is my nighttime
and vice versa.

02:30.478 --> 02:32.217
We had a one-hour video chat
this morning.

02:32.260 --> 02:34.347
3:00 a.m., my time.

02:34.391 --> 02:35.304
I'm exhausted.

02:35.347 --> 02:36.565
Exhausted, huh?

02:37.521 --> 02:39.347
So how intimate are your calls?

02:39.391 --> 02:42.130
More than just faces on-screen?

02:42.173 --> 02:44.043
Whose mind goes there?
Seriously.

02:44.086 --> 02:45.695
I'll tell you who,

02:45.739 --> 02:47.652
a guy who's single at the moment
and would appreciate

02:47.695 --> 02:49.434
any kind of face time.

02:50.739 --> 02:52.217
Let's go, single guy.

02:52.260 --> 02:54.782
Dead Navy officer
on the Ellipse.

03:00.217 --> 03:02.347
There have been five muggings in
the area in the past two weeks.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.043
Yeah, I heard it
on the news.

03:04.086 --> 03:07.130
Up until now, no one's been
hurt, let alone killed.

03:07.173 --> 03:09.695
We've been calling the perp
"the Polite Mugger."

03:09.739 --> 03:12.173
Even though
he held a knife on them,

03:12.217 --> 03:16.608
all the victims commented on how
courteous and apologetic he was.

03:16.652 --> 03:17.826
They describe him?

03:17.869 --> 03:19.565
Young, male, Caucasian.

03:19.608 --> 03:21.695
Wearing a backpack.
Nothing more than that.

03:21.739 --> 03:24.434
Think they were staring
at the knife and not his face.

03:25.652 --> 03:27.130
We do have a photograph

03:27.173 --> 03:29.173
of him fleeing one
of the thefts, but...

03:29.217 --> 03:30.695
it is useless.Why?

03:30.739 --> 03:33.086
It was taken by a tourist
near the Vietnam Memorial.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.391
Unfortunately, it only
shows the back of his head.

03:35.434 --> 03:37.086
I'd get it to NCIS.

03:37.130 --> 03:39.521
We got a forensic scientist
there that works miracles.

03:39.565 --> 03:41.000
Doubt there's much
he can do with it.

03:41.043 --> 03:43.782
She.

03:43.826 --> 03:45.695
Okay.

03:45.739 --> 03:47.130
I'll get it to her.

03:47.173 --> 03:49.260
McGEE:
Boss...

03:49.304 --> 03:51.913
fingerprint scan
matches the I.D.

03:51.956 --> 03:54.347
Lieutenant Commander
Edward "Ned" Wallace.

03:54.391 --> 03:56.173
He's assigned to the Pentagon.

03:56.217 --> 03:57.521
His wallet's missing,
and there's a tan line

03:57.565 --> 04:00.086
on his wrist
suggesting a missing watch.

04:00.130 --> 04:01.217
What do you got, Duck?

04:01.260 --> 04:03.000
He's been dead about two hours.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.347
A little after 8:00.

04:04.391 --> 04:07.217
These stab wounds suggest
a large knife.

04:07.260 --> 04:10.043
Oh, and, uh, defensive wounds
on both his hands

04:10.086 --> 04:13.086
show me that he put up
quite a fight.

04:13.130 --> 04:15.173
Looks like a mugging gone bad.

04:15.217 --> 04:18.347
I asked National Park Service
and Metro

04:18.391 --> 04:20.652
for any video surveillance
they have of the area.

04:20.695 --> 04:21.913
Unfortunately, trees

04:21.956 --> 04:24.391
block the view
in the immediate vicinity.

04:26.608 --> 04:28.043
[phone ringing]

04:33.913 --> 04:36.217
It's coming
from the evidence box.

04:38.086 --> 04:40.260
It's the victim's.

04:40.304 --> 04:41.217
Answer it.

04:44.869 --> 04:46.739
Blocked.

04:46.782 --> 04:48.086
Secured.

04:48.130 --> 04:49.304
Answer it!

04:49.347 --> 04:51.130
Hello.

04:52.913 --> 04:54.043
You first. Who's this?

04:54.086 --> 04:55.347
Come on.

04:55.391 --> 04:57.086
Stop being a wiseass.
Who is this?

04:59.608 --> 05:00.565
Uh, yes, sir.

05:00.608 --> 05:02.521
Hold on a second.

05:02.565 --> 05:06.043
Uh, you better take this, boss.
It's the president.

05:06.086 --> 05:08.043
Of the United States.

05:08.086 --> 05:09.565
Of America.

05:24.695 --> 05:27.130
You see
the president?Oh, yeah.

05:27.173 --> 05:28.695
Was the commander
a friend of his?

05:28.739 --> 05:30.695
He shadowed POTUS
for four years.

05:30.739 --> 05:31.826
He was a presidential aide

05:31.869 --> 05:33.434
during the first term--
they hit it off.

05:33.478 --> 05:35.043
Commander Wallace still played
in a pickup basketball game

05:35.086 --> 05:37.217
at the White House
every Saturday morning.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.652
VANCE: He called the
president last night.

05:38.695 --> 05:40.652
Wanted to know if he could have
a couple of minutes

05:40.695 --> 05:42.478
to talk to him about something.

05:42.521 --> 05:44.434
I can't believe
I called POTUS a wiseass.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.782
[phone rings]

05:45.826 --> 05:47.826
Excuse me.
I have to take this.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.391
This is Vance.

05:49.434 --> 05:51.652
The president was free for
breakfast, told him to stop by.

05:51.695 --> 05:54.000
When Wallace didn't show, the
president called his cell phone.

05:54.043 --> 05:55.782
Did he know what Wallace wanted
to talk about?

05:55.826 --> 05:57.739
No.Something's
come up.

05:57.782 --> 05:59.608
I'm gonna have to leave.
Keep me posted.

05:59.652 --> 06:02.434
What do we know about Wallace?

06:02.478 --> 06:04.521
BISHOP: Lieutenant Commander
Ned Wallace was born

06:04.565 --> 06:07.043
in Greenwich,
Connecticut.Pricey.

06:07.086 --> 06:09.434
Graduated from Annapolis.
Married, no children.

06:09.478 --> 06:12.304
He left the White House
last year and was

06:12.347 --> 06:14.304
Assistant Director of Policy
and Plans for the Navy

06:14.347 --> 06:16.434
at the Pentagon.McGEE:
He's from a Navy family.

06:16.478 --> 06:19.739
Third generation. Grandfather
was an admiral in WWII.

06:19.782 --> 06:22.565
You tell the president
we suspect it was a mugging?

06:22.608 --> 06:25.043
He still wants
to be kept in the loop.

06:28.608 --> 06:30.565
BISHOP:
Hey, Abbs.

06:30.608 --> 06:32.782
Hey, Bishop. What do you
think about these shoes?

06:32.826 --> 06:34.739
Uh...

06:34.782 --> 06:36.608
I could never
pull those off,

06:36.652 --> 06:39.043
but you could
totally rock them.

06:39.086 --> 06:40.913
Hi.

06:40.956 --> 06:42.608
Oh, Abby,
this is Sergeant Moore.

06:45.913 --> 06:47.217
Is there something wrong?

06:47.260 --> 06:50.391
No, just admiring
your, uh, tattoo.

06:50.434 --> 06:52.739
Oh. Yeah.

06:57.826 --> 07:00.695
Wow. Nice ink.

07:00.739 --> 07:01.652
Is that a Dutch Shore?

07:01.695 --> 07:03.956
Yep. Did this, too.

07:06.086 --> 07:07.739
It's beautiful.

07:07.782 --> 07:09.869
He's the best-- his design...

07:09.913 --> 07:10.782
and his detail.

07:10.826 --> 07:12.478
Sorry, Bishop.

07:12.521 --> 07:14.260
I'm sure this doesn't
interest you at all.

07:14.304 --> 07:15.782
Why would you say that?

07:15.826 --> 07:17.739
How do you know
I don't have a tat?

07:17.782 --> 07:20.043
Okay. Show us.

07:20.086 --> 07:22.695
Oh, uh, show Abby
the photograph.

07:22.739 --> 07:24.913
Mm-hmm.

07:24.956 --> 07:28.043
Tourist took this shot of
the suspect here in the red hat

07:28.086 --> 07:30.913
running away from
the Mall last week.

07:30.956 --> 07:33.913
We use FBI forensics.
But so far, with no one injured,

07:33.956 --> 07:35.565
the thefts haven't been
a high priority,

07:35.608 --> 07:36.869
so they haven't
gotten around to, uh,

07:36.913 --> 07:38.217
analyzing it yet.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.782
ABBY: There's a distorted
reflection of the guy

07:42.826 --> 07:43.956
on the granite wall.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.565
Could you get me
the original digital file?

07:46.608 --> 07:47.652
I think so.

07:47.695 --> 07:51.130
I think I can
do something with it.

07:51.173 --> 07:53.260
Where's my husband's body?Here.

07:53.304 --> 07:54.608
With our medical examiner.

07:54.652 --> 07:56.565
When can I see him?

07:56.608 --> 07:58.913
I'll have Dr. Mallard
contact you when he's through.

08:00.739 --> 08:04.043
Your husband was on his way to
see the president this morning.

08:04.086 --> 08:05.565
Do you know why?No.

08:05.608 --> 08:06.956
He didn't
say anything to you

08:07.000 --> 08:08.173
before he left the house?

08:10.652 --> 08:14.652
I... haven't seen Ned
in a couple of weeks.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.130
We were living apart.
Uh, just a trial separation.

08:20.173 --> 08:22.869
I'm staying in the house,
and he was on his yacht.

08:22.913 --> 08:23.956
TONY:
His yacht?

08:24.000 --> 08:27.043
Uh, where would that be?

08:27.086 --> 08:28.347
The Washington Channel.

08:28.391 --> 08:30.391
Just south of the Mall.

08:30.434 --> 08:32.739
It's an easy walk
to the White House.

08:32.782 --> 08:34.434
Your husband's wallet
was missing

08:34.478 --> 08:36.217
and, apparently, a watch.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.565
Do you know what kind he wore?

08:37.608 --> 08:41.565
Um... he has several.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.434
If he was wearing his
grandfather's Patek Philippe,

08:44.478 --> 08:47.043
it's worth a fortune.

08:47.086 --> 08:48.565
TONY: Has a yacht
in the marina

08:48.608 --> 08:50.043
and wears a priceless watch.

08:50.086 --> 08:53.043
You don't get those things
on a Navy salary.

08:53.086 --> 08:54.869
He was raised
in Greenwich, Connecticut.

08:54.913 --> 08:57.652
So is there family money?

08:57.695 --> 09:00.739
Trust fund?His maternal grandmother
was an heiress.

09:02.347 --> 09:03.956
Silver mines.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.695
You and the commander
ever go for counseling?

09:06.739 --> 09:08.260
No.

09:10.260 --> 09:12.217
W-We both agreed
that we needed more space,

09:12.260 --> 09:14.739
but, no, we were working things
out on our own.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.695
[sighs]

09:18.739 --> 09:21.000
Then this happens.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.739
The murder weapon appears
to be a tactical knife

09:28.782 --> 09:31.739
with a six- or seven-inch
serrated blade.

09:31.782 --> 09:35.565
The angle of the thrusts
indicate that the mugger

09:35.608 --> 09:37.869
was about the same height
as our victim.

09:37.913 --> 09:40.869
And as the wounds are
on the right side,

09:40.913 --> 09:43.347
most likely,
he was left-handed.

09:43.391 --> 09:46.347
Anything else?No, unfortunately,

09:46.391 --> 09:50.826
my patient is not
telling us any more.

09:52.304 --> 09:54.956
Jethro, when you got up
this morning,

09:55.000 --> 09:56.695
did you ever imagine
you'd be meeting

09:56.739 --> 09:58.956
with the President
of the United States?

10:01.086 --> 10:03.478
Hey, Leon. Don't have
anything for you yet.

10:03.521 --> 10:05.043
Oh, I didn't expect
you would.

10:05.086 --> 10:06.608
I came down
to see Dr. Mallard

10:06.652 --> 10:08.652
about another matter.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.652
Okay. Fill you in
when we got something.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.739
VANCE: Dr. Mallard...DUCKY: Hmm?

10:14.782 --> 10:16.695
VANCE: I'd like to ask you...
[continues indistinctly]

10:16.739 --> 10:19.608
Would you mind taking
a look at this for me?

10:21.173 --> 10:23.521
She said they need a little
space to work things out.

10:23.565 --> 10:25.086
I believe her.Oh, come on.

10:25.130 --> 10:26.739
Her husband was
brutally attacked

10:26.782 --> 10:28.304
and she didn't even
seem that upset.

10:28.347 --> 10:30.739
She was in shock. People react
differently to tragic news.

10:30.782 --> 10:33.739
This was a mugging.You're the one that always
suspects the spouse.

10:33.782 --> 10:35.086
Especially when big
money's involved.

10:35.130 --> 10:38.086
I studied her eyes.
The eyes don't lie.

10:38.130 --> 10:40.478
What if I told you
there was another woman?

10:40.521 --> 10:43.478
I checked Commander
Wallace's cell phone records.

10:43.521 --> 10:45.173
His call to the White House
followed several calls

10:45.217 --> 10:47.478
he received from
a Courtney Reed.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.739
The first was from
an office extension

10:49.782 --> 10:52.043
at the management consulting
firm where she works,

10:52.086 --> 10:53.739
Colford-Webb.

10:53.782 --> 10:55.347
Two others were from
her cell phone.

10:55.391 --> 10:57.652
I'll see if I can
locate her cell.

10:57.695 --> 10:58.739
You background her?

10:58.782 --> 11:00.956
Not yet.What about Colford-Webb?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.739
I know them.
I dealt with them at NSA.

11:02.782 --> 11:04.434
It's a DC-based company.

11:04.478 --> 11:06.043
Provides technology and
security services,

11:06.086 --> 11:08.130
primarily to
government agencies.

11:08.173 --> 11:11.043
It was founded by...
Richard Colford,

11:11.086 --> 11:12.478
former CIA.

11:12.521 --> 11:14.043
Interesting.

11:14.086 --> 11:16.086
Well, Courtney Reed's
phone is turned off.

11:16.130 --> 11:17.478
I'll bet they were
having an affair,

11:17.521 --> 11:19.608
and Mrs. Wallace
found out about it.

11:19.652 --> 11:21.608
Whoa. Slow down, McGee.

11:21.652 --> 11:23.521
Find out a little bit more
about Ms. Reed

11:23.565 --> 11:24.652
before we jump to conclusions.

11:24.695 --> 11:26.695
[phone rings]

11:26.739 --> 11:28.695
McGee.

11:28.739 --> 11:31.434
McGee. I need you to run down
a local address for me.

11:31.478 --> 11:33.000
Sure, let me grab a pen.

11:33.043 --> 11:34.347
Abby is incredible.

11:34.391 --> 11:35.913
Yeah.I thought the tourist's

11:35.956 --> 11:37.347
photo was useless, but

11:37.391 --> 11:39.260
she's a magician.
Now you can

11:39.304 --> 11:41.260
clearly see the face
in the reflection.

11:41.304 --> 11:43.260
She ran the image
against facial recognition,

11:43.304 --> 11:45.652
got a hit from
his New Mexico I.D.--

11:45.695 --> 11:47.086
Nicholas Dunne.

11:47.130 --> 11:49.782
I mean, she's just...
acts so cool,

11:49.826 --> 11:52.608
like she does this every day.She does.

11:52.652 --> 11:54.434
MOORE: Never met
anyone like her.

11:54.478 --> 11:55.608
Who's she talking to?

11:55.652 --> 11:57.608
One of your agents upstairs.

11:57.652 --> 11:59.521
Gotta ask you something.

11:59.565 --> 12:00.695
No, she's not married.

12:00.739 --> 12:03.347
She's not dating anybody.

12:03.391 --> 12:04.739
How'd you know I was...

12:04.782 --> 12:06.434
Wild guess.

12:06.478 --> 12:08.826
Our suspect is a student
at John Hamilton University,

12:08.869 --> 12:11.043
he lives in the dorm,

12:11.086 --> 12:12.782
and McGee has
an address for you.

12:19.782 --> 12:20.782
[whistle blows]

12:22.869 --> 12:24.695
Nicholas Dunne?

12:24.739 --> 12:26.826
Yes, sir.

12:26.869 --> 12:29.043
Special Agent Gibbs,
Special Agent McGee.

12:29.086 --> 12:31.000
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.173
Sure. About what?

12:32.217 --> 12:34.130
Muggings on the National Mall.

12:34.173 --> 12:36.565
Doubt I can help you.

12:36.608 --> 12:38.652
I got to get back
to practice.Yeah, well...

12:38.695 --> 12:40.695
practice is gonna
have to wait.

12:40.739 --> 12:43.043
Why do you want
to talk to me?

12:43.086 --> 12:45.173
We've got a photograph of you
fleeing a mugging

12:45.217 --> 12:46.521
near the Vietnam Memorial
last Friday,

12:46.565 --> 12:48.782
wearing this backpack.

12:48.826 --> 12:50.695
You mind if we search it?

12:52.217 --> 12:54.217
Yeah... yeah, I do.

12:54.260 --> 12:55.608
You need probable cause.

12:55.652 --> 12:58.000
I don't think
you meet that threshold.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.565
You a law student?

12:59.608 --> 13:01.695
Criminology major.Ah, good. Well, today,

13:01.739 --> 13:03.608
you're gonna get
a practical education,

13:03.652 --> 13:05.521
see how the system really
works, firsthand-- come on.

13:05.565 --> 13:06.652
Where?

13:06.695 --> 13:07.869
Washington Navy Yard.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.173
I don't know anything.

13:09.217 --> 13:10.913
And why are Navy cops
investigating?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.695
A lieutenant commander
was killed this morning.

13:12.739 --> 13:15.695
With a knife
like the one used

13:15.739 --> 13:17.043
in all the other
robberies.

13:17.086 --> 13:18.869
Whoa. Killed?

13:18.913 --> 13:20.173
You've got
the wrong guy.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.043
We'll talk about it.No, wait...

13:22.086 --> 13:24.608
Look, I may have taken
some money and stuff off people,

13:24.652 --> 13:26.782
but I wouldn't hurt a soul,
a-and I can prove it.

13:26.826 --> 13:29.913
You want to look in my backpack?
Go ahead.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.130
You confessing
to the robberies?

13:38.826 --> 13:40.086
Boss.

13:40.130 --> 13:42.217
He might be
telling the truth.

13:45.347 --> 13:46.652
It's a rubber training knife.

13:58.217 --> 14:00.173
VANCE:
Gibbs.Yeah.

14:00.217 --> 14:02.217
Downstairs.

14:11.608 --> 14:13.565
Got a call from
the White House.

14:13.608 --> 14:15.173
The president
wanted an update.

14:15.217 --> 14:17.478
I had to tell him we don't
have anything yet.

14:17.521 --> 14:19.304
Yeah, well...

14:19.347 --> 14:21.260
we're holding a suspect
for the muggings,

14:21.304 --> 14:23.521
says he's got an alibi...

14:23.565 --> 14:25.869
for Commander Wallace's
stabbing.

14:25.913 --> 14:28.173
We're checking it out.
You want some?

14:28.217 --> 14:29.608
No, not for me.

14:36.956 --> 14:38.173
Everything okay?

14:41.173 --> 14:44.130
Said you wanted to talk.

14:44.173 --> 14:46.260
Not about the...

14:46.304 --> 14:48.000
the president's call, is it?

14:48.043 --> 14:49.086
Mm.

14:51.478 --> 14:54.826
A week ago, I go in for a
routine physical, feeling fine.

14:54.869 --> 14:56.869
Now they want to
run more tests.

14:58.260 --> 15:01.000
Yeah? What's wrong?

15:01.043 --> 15:04.565
A chest X-ray showed that...

15:04.608 --> 15:06.782
there are spots on my lungs.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.434
What's your doctor
say about that?

15:10.478 --> 15:13.000
He's waiting for the results

15:13.043 --> 15:15.956
of a CAT scan
that I'm taking tomorrow.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I'll know more then.

15:19.478 --> 15:21.000
He give a guess?

15:21.043 --> 15:22.521
Lymphoma.

15:22.565 --> 15:24.565
An advanced stage.

15:28.043 --> 15:30.260
I'm scared, Gibbs.

15:31.434 --> 15:34.043
Yeah.

15:34.086 --> 15:35.565
Anybody would be.

15:35.608 --> 15:38.000
I, um...

15:38.043 --> 15:40.347
I showed the X-rays
to Dr. Mallard.

15:40.391 --> 15:43.000
He tried to downplay it,
but when I pressed him,

15:43.043 --> 15:45.000
he admitted it
didn't look good.

15:50.391 --> 15:53.739
It's Kayla and Jared that I'm
really worried about, Gibbs.

15:53.782 --> 15:56.304
They've been through
so much already and I...

15:58.521 --> 16:00.478
I miss my wife.
I miss Jackie.

16:00.521 --> 16:02.869
She was so strong.Leon...

16:02.913 --> 16:04.217
She...Leon...?

16:05.434 --> 16:07.130
You gotta stay positive.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.173
It's crazy, Gibbs.

16:16.391 --> 16:18.086
I always knew that
there was a chance

16:18.130 --> 16:20.739
that I might die
a violent death.

16:20.782 --> 16:24.217
Hell, I've come close.

16:24.260 --> 16:26.130
I never thought that...

16:26.173 --> 16:27.304
frigging spots on my lungs

16:27.347 --> 16:29.043
would be the things
that would get me.

16:39.913 --> 16:41.173
TONY:
Nicholas Dunne's alibi

16:41.217 --> 16:42.913
for yesterday morning's
murder was solid.

16:42.956 --> 16:45.260
However, he confessed
to the other muggings.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.217
He sign a statement?

16:46.260 --> 16:47.826
TONY:
Hey.

16:47.869 --> 16:49.347
We're not gonna do
all your work for you.

16:49.391 --> 16:51.391
Where is he?

16:51.434 --> 16:53.173
Holding cell.
I'll take you.

16:55.304 --> 16:57.043
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:58.086 --> 16:59.043
Hi.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.043
Hey.
Abby.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.826
I-I heard you were
in the building, so...

17:02.869 --> 17:05.130
uh, so...

17:05.173 --> 17:07.260
I could totally take him.

17:07.304 --> 17:09.086
Yeah, uh, yeah,
go for it.

17:11.043 --> 17:12.739
Come on, Burt.

17:15.434 --> 17:16.739
So where are we?

17:16.782 --> 17:19.000
Well, either there's
another mugger out there,

17:19.043 --> 17:20.782
or Wallace was murdered

17:20.826 --> 17:22.565
and it was made to look
like the previous crimes.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.086
Why? Give me a motive.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.608
McGEE:
Ah...

17:25.652 --> 17:27.217
just as I suspected.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.652
Wallace and his wife have
a pre-nuptial agreement.

17:29.695 --> 17:31.260
What do you expect?
The guy's got a lot of money.

17:31.304 --> 17:32.826
With the commander's death,

17:32.869 --> 17:34.782
his wife is going to be
an extremely rich woman.

17:34.826 --> 17:36.826
If divorced,
Mrs. Wallace would receive

17:36.869 --> 17:38.869
a fraction of what
she's gonna get now.
TONY:
Tim.

17:38.913 --> 17:40.434
She said they were
working things out.

17:41.608 --> 17:43.260
GIBBS:
Hey...

17:44.826 --> 17:46.869
Who is that?

17:46.913 --> 17:50.000
Former Navy Lieutenant
Courtney Reed.

17:50.043 --> 17:51.434
The woman who called
Commander Wallace.

17:51.478 --> 17:53.043
BISHOP: Mm-hmm.
They go way back.

17:53.086 --> 17:54.434
Uh, they were midshipmen
together at Annapolis.

17:54.478 --> 17:55.652
Talk to her.
BISHOP:
I tried.

17:55.695 --> 17:56.652
She's not at her apartment,

17:56.695 --> 17:58.043
her cell's off.

17:58.086 --> 17:59.434
I phoned her office,
but she called in sick.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.260
Find her.
Put out a BOLO.

18:01.304 --> 18:03.304
Already did, boss.

18:03.347 --> 18:05.391
Got the warrant to search
Commander Wallace's yacht.

18:05.434 --> 18:06.565
Why are you still here, then?

18:06.608 --> 18:08.347
Well, we were
waiting for you.

18:08.391 --> 18:09.347
Take her.

18:09.391 --> 18:10.391
Excellent.

18:10.434 --> 18:11.782
Let's do it.

18:14.217 --> 18:16.000
Go to the Pentagon.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.652
Talk to Wallace's C.O.

18:27.043 --> 18:29.173
TONY: If you think about it,
science is amazing.

18:29.217 --> 18:31.043
I mean, video phone sex.

18:31.086 --> 18:32.347
You and Jake ever...Wow!

18:32.391 --> 18:33.652
You have no boundaries.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.260
Come on,
I'm messing with you.

18:35.304 --> 18:37.130
Did you miss the sexual
harassment seminar?

18:37.173 --> 18:39.000
Every year.
Yeah.

18:40.391 --> 18:41.608
TONY:
This is it.

18:41.652 --> 18:43.782
[whistles]

18:43.826 --> 18:46.217
I've thought about
living on a boat before.

18:46.260 --> 18:47.608
It's kind of romantic.

18:47.652 --> 18:50.217
BISHOP: Mmm, not for me,
but Jake would love it.

18:50.260 --> 18:54.086
Well, maybe it's a guy thing.

18:54.130 --> 18:55.956
I need a bigger bathroom.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.217
And a yard.

18:57.260 --> 18:58.826
TONY:
What do you want
with a yard?

18:58.869 --> 19:00.130
That's a lot of work.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.869
You sound like Jake.

19:01.913 --> 19:03.391
I sound like Jake?

19:03.434 --> 19:05.695
We got into more
arguments this summer

19:05.739 --> 19:07.260
while we were
looking at houses.

19:07.304 --> 19:09.652
It's like we were
totally out of sync.

19:09.695 --> 19:11.826
I think that's just called
"being married."

19:11.869 --> 19:14.217
Out of sync, huh?

19:14.260 --> 19:16.043
How 'bout the big question?

19:16.086 --> 19:18.304
Rug rats. Kids.

19:18.347 --> 19:21.956
I hope that's another question
you don't expect me to answer.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.391
I think he was entertaining
other women on this boat.

19:25.434 --> 19:28.043
He hid pictures
of his wife.

19:28.086 --> 19:29.217
This her?

19:29.260 --> 19:31.956
Yes, ma'am.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.391
Well, there's definitely been
another lady aboard.

19:36.434 --> 19:37.521
What makes you say that?

19:37.565 --> 19:39.043
Come here.

19:42.521 --> 19:43.826
Hair tie.

19:43.869 --> 19:45.086
Women with long
hair use them.

19:45.130 --> 19:46.217
I keep them everywhere.

19:46.260 --> 19:48.869
My house, car,
desk drawer at the office.

19:48.913 --> 19:50.695
I mean, I'm constantly
losing them.

19:52.304 --> 19:54.304
Wallace's wife has short hair.

19:54.347 --> 19:55.173
She wouldn't need one.

19:55.217 --> 19:57.608
And this...

19:57.652 --> 19:59.434
shampoo...

19:59.478 --> 20:02.260
brings out
blonde highlights.

20:02.304 --> 20:05.217
Clearly not Mrs. Wallace's.

20:05.260 --> 20:07.086
Hmm.
Long hair, blonde.

20:07.130 --> 20:08.434
You just described yourself.

20:08.478 --> 20:10.826
Or Courtney Reed.Mm!

20:10.869 --> 20:12.826
You're getting good
at this, probie.

20:12.869 --> 20:14.391
Hmm. An affair?

20:14.434 --> 20:16.521
I'm thinking
the missing woman

20:16.565 --> 20:18.347
was the cause for the
Wallaces' separation.

20:18.391 --> 20:22.043
Ah. You're beginning
to sound like McGee.

20:31.347 --> 20:33.173
Hey, boss.

20:33.217 --> 20:35.043
Hey.

20:35.086 --> 20:36.869
How'd it go with
Commander Wallace's C.O.?

20:36.913 --> 20:39.347
Well, he can't think
of a reason why anyone
would kill him.

20:39.391 --> 20:41.391
Wallace wasn't read into
any top-secret documents

20:41.434 --> 20:43.304
or working on
anything sensitive.

20:43.347 --> 20:45.913
In the C.O.'s experience,
Wallace was a good officer

20:45.956 --> 20:47.260
who was a well-liked guy.

20:47.304 --> 20:49.304
He know Wallace and
his wife had separated?

20:49.347 --> 20:52.000
No, and he never heard the name
"Courtney Reed".

20:52.043 --> 20:54.521
[phone ringing]

21:03.782 --> 21:05.130
You gonna get that?

21:05.173 --> 21:08.130
I'll deal with it later.

21:10.217 --> 21:13.086
[ringing continues]

21:13.130 --> 21:15.347
ABBY:
Ah! Food!

21:15.391 --> 21:16.782
Thank you.
I'm starving.

21:16.826 --> 21:19.000
Oh, thank you
for working through lunch, Abby.

21:19.043 --> 21:21.304
You find anything interesting
on Commander Wallace's computer?

21:21.347 --> 21:24.086
An e-mail from his lawyer.What did the e-mail say?

21:24.130 --> 21:26.347
It's a draft
of divorce papers.

21:26.391 --> 21:29.304
Really? The missus said they
were working things out.

21:29.347 --> 21:30.304
Where's my garden burger?

21:30.347 --> 21:32.956
Oh, it is right here

21:33.000 --> 21:35.086
on...

21:35.130 --> 21:37.304
a gluten-free bun.
[wry laugh]

21:37.347 --> 21:38.521
TONY:
Damn!

21:38.565 --> 21:40.478
Was I fooled by
those gorgeous lying eyes?

21:40.521 --> 21:42.043
Hey, you think McGee was right?

21:42.086 --> 21:43.173
Trish Wallace
is after the money?

21:43.217 --> 21:45.347
Hey, uh, did any of
the prints we lifted

21:45.391 --> 21:46.826
from the boat
match Courtney Reed?

21:46.869 --> 21:49.173
Yeah, a bunch of
them were hers.

21:49.217 --> 21:50.434
She spent a lot of time there.

21:50.478 --> 21:52.565
[phone ringing]Eat up, Bishop. We're going

21:52.608 --> 21:54.826
to Courtney Reed's apartment.
Yeah, McGee?

21:54.869 --> 21:57.304
Okay, so, Sergeant Moore...Mm-hmm.

21:57.347 --> 21:59.565
the park police officer--
oh, my God, so cute, right?

21:59.608 --> 22:01.217
Uh, yeah. Duh.

22:01.260 --> 22:02.608
Oh.
TONY:
Change of plans.

22:02.652 --> 22:04.391
We're going
to MTAC.
Uh, why? What's up?

22:04.434 --> 22:05.434
Got a hit on our BOLO.

22:06.913 --> 22:10.043
One of our units found Courtney
Reed's vehicle submerged

22:10.086 --> 22:11.826
in the river early this morning.

22:11.869 --> 22:14.869
Went through a barrier
and down an embankment.

22:14.913 --> 22:16.739
Evidence suggests
the driver lost control.

22:16.782 --> 22:18.521
Her body wasn't in the car?

22:18.565 --> 22:21.043
Nope.
Side window was smashed.

22:21.086 --> 22:22.869
Divers found her purse
and cell phone.

22:22.913 --> 22:24.608
So, she got out,

22:24.652 --> 22:26.826
but the current probably
took her body downstream.

22:26.869 --> 22:29.260
That would explain why
she didn't answer her phone

22:29.304 --> 22:30.956
or use a credit card.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.434
We're dragging the river
and searching the banks.

22:32.478 --> 22:34.173
Could take days to find her.

22:34.217 --> 22:35.521
Did you search
her apartment?

22:35.565 --> 22:37.304
Have a unit there right now.
Nothing.

22:37.347 --> 22:40.000
What's NCIS's interest
in Miss Reed?

22:40.043 --> 22:41.826
We're investigating the death
of a Navy officer.

22:41.869 --> 22:44.434
We believe she was
the last person to talk to him.

22:44.478 --> 22:46.043
How'd your Navy guy die?

22:46.086 --> 22:47.869
Stabbed to death
near the White House.

22:47.913 --> 22:49.173
What's the connection?

22:55.347 --> 22:59.869
A thoracic surgeon reviewed
the CAT scan I had today,

22:59.913 --> 23:03.608
and consulted with colleagues.

23:03.652 --> 23:06.478
And they all agree.

23:06.521 --> 23:08.782
"It looks like lymphoma."

23:11.304 --> 23:13.608
But they can't be 100% sure.

23:13.652 --> 23:16.304
No.

23:16.347 --> 23:22.043
So, I go to the hospital
tomorrow for surgery.

23:23.086 --> 23:26.086
They have to
go into my lungs

23:26.130 --> 23:29.043
to obtain tissue
for a biopsy.

23:29.086 --> 23:31.608
Yes. They'll-they'll do
a bronchoscopy

23:31.652 --> 23:34.478
and a... thoracotomy.

23:34.521 --> 23:37.347
It's the only way
to be definitive.
Hmm.

23:38.956 --> 23:41.217
Surgeon didn't
pull any punches.

23:42.869 --> 23:45.565
He asked me if I had
my life in order.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.956
And do you?

23:54.782 --> 23:57.217
No.

23:59.217 --> 24:01.478
Since Jackie's death,
I haven't been able to

24:01.521 --> 24:04.000
focus.

24:05.217 --> 24:07.739
I haven't redone my will.

24:07.782 --> 24:11.260
Nor have I made any provision
for the care of the children.

24:30.826 --> 24:33.260
MAN:
Courtney called in sick
yesterday.

24:33.304 --> 24:35.347
It didn't sound that serious.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.913
When she didn't come in
this morning or call,

24:36.956 --> 24:38.826
I phoned, but got no answer.

24:38.869 --> 24:41.869
It's strange because Courtney 's
a very conscientious employee.

24:41.913 --> 24:43.913
It's not like her
to be irresponsible.

24:43.956 --> 24:45.739
How long has she worked
for you, Mr. Tolson?

24:45.782 --> 24:47.217
About six years.

24:47.260 --> 24:49.782
She joined us just after
she got out of the Navy.

24:49.826 --> 24:52.043
Courtney's a systems analyst.

24:52.086 --> 24:54.826
With her military background,
our clients love her.

24:54.869 --> 24:57.695
You do a lot of
government work.Almost exclusively.

24:57.739 --> 25:01.130
DoD, NSA, CIA-- basically,
all the intelligence agencies.

25:01.173 --> 25:02.826
MAN 2:
Excuse me, gentlemen.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.782
I heard NCIS was
in the building.

25:04.826 --> 25:06.478
What's up?

25:06.521 --> 25:08.608
Richard Colford,
our founder and CEO.

25:08.652 --> 25:10.652
Special Agents Gibbs
and McGee.

25:10.695 --> 25:12.043
COLFORD:
Pleasure.

25:12.086 --> 25:13.652
Welcome.
Hello.

25:13.695 --> 25:15.826
They're concerned
about Courtney Reed.

25:15.869 --> 25:16.739
She seems to be missing.

25:16.782 --> 25:18.260
Missing?!

25:18.304 --> 25:20.434
Yeah, her car was found
by local authorities

25:20.478 --> 25:22.391
submerged in a
Harford County river.

25:22.434 --> 25:25.043
They haven't found her body,
but they're still searching.

25:25.086 --> 25:26.565
Courtney ever mention

25:26.608 --> 25:28.130
a Lieutenant
Commander Ned Wallace?

25:28.173 --> 25:30.826
Not that I can remember.

25:30.869 --> 25:32.043
We need access
to Miss Reed's office

25:32.086 --> 25:33.565
and whatever else
she was working on.

25:33.608 --> 25:34.826
How does her work here relate

25:34.869 --> 25:36.434
to a car accident?

25:36.478 --> 25:38.347
We're not sure it
was an accident.

25:38.391 --> 25:40.173
Really?

25:41.347 --> 25:42.782
I assure you, Agent Gibbs,

25:42.826 --> 25:44.913
we'll cooperate with NCIS.

25:44.956 --> 25:47.086
But we have to get the proper
clearances, permissions.

25:47.130 --> 25:49.478
We don't want to violate
any federal secrecy laws.

25:49.521 --> 25:51.608
Understood.

25:54.695 --> 25:55.913
VANCE:
Is this the Vance residence?

25:55.956 --> 25:57.782
[children laughing]

25:57.826 --> 25:59.521
[laughing,
chatting playfully]

25:59.565 --> 26:01.826
I missed you, Dad.Hey, Jared.

26:01.869 --> 26:05.130
What did you bring us?Oh, that's it,
huh, Kayla?

26:05.173 --> 26:06.260
You just get right to it, huh?

26:06.304 --> 26:07.478
Why don't you give me
a hug first?

26:07.521 --> 26:09.695
Oh, I missed you.Hey, you.
Me, too.

26:09.739 --> 26:12.217
Now, you know your father
wouldn't have gone to Chicago
without bringing back some--

26:12.260 --> 26:14.956
Frango mints.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.043
What about me?What about you?

26:17.086 --> 26:18.913
You didn't think I'd forget
about you, did you?

26:18.956 --> 26:20.434
These... are very old...

26:20.478 --> 26:23.217
Ah!
and they're very
special to me.

26:23.260 --> 26:25.043
Wow! Cool!

26:25.086 --> 26:26.521
[sniffing]

26:26.565 --> 26:27.826
Ew, they smell!

26:27.869 --> 26:29.347
That's from hard work.

26:29.391 --> 26:30.739
Hard work stinks.

26:30.782 --> 26:32.304
Yes, it does.

26:32.347 --> 26:33.826
Mmm! Mine smell good.

26:33.869 --> 26:35.043
No, no, no,
not till after we eat.

26:35.086 --> 26:36.913
Now, you two go wash up.
Give me the mints.

26:36.956 --> 26:38.565
Thanks, Daddy.Come on!

26:38.608 --> 26:40.173
KAYLA:
Let's wash our hands, Jared.

26:40.217 --> 26:42.086
[kids chatting in distance]Come on, move out of the way...

26:42.130 --> 26:43.695
Mmm.

26:46.478 --> 26:48.739
So, I did good?

26:48.782 --> 26:51.000
You did.

26:52.347 --> 26:54.565
[intercom beeping]

26:54.608 --> 26:56.826
Yes?

26:56.869 --> 27:00.043
Send her in, Pamela.
Thank you.

27:02.869 --> 27:05.130
Lara, thank you
for coming.

27:05.173 --> 27:08.130
No problem, Mister V.

27:08.173 --> 27:10.521
When you asked me
to come to your office

27:10.565 --> 27:11.826
and didn't tell my why...

27:11.869 --> 27:14.826
I have to confess,
it's got me worried.

27:14.869 --> 27:16.913
Did I do something wrong
with the children?

27:16.956 --> 27:19.130
No, no, no, just the opposite.

27:19.173 --> 27:21.086
You've-you've been
wonderful with them.

27:21.130 --> 27:22.782
Uh, please.

27:24.869 --> 27:27.086
Actually, I haven't
told you enough

27:27.130 --> 27:33.739
just how much I truly appreciate
all you've done for my family.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.869
Then, uh... why am I here?

27:37.913 --> 27:41.695
I have to go into
the hospital tomorrow,

27:41.739 --> 27:43.956
for a couple days,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.260
and I need you
to take care of the kids.

27:46.304 --> 27:50.304
Sure.

27:50.347 --> 27:52.826
I'm having exploratory surgery.

27:52.869 --> 27:55.043
It's a lung biopsy.

27:55.086 --> 27:57.043
That sounds serious.

27:57.086 --> 27:59.260
It could be.

28:02.695 --> 28:05.086
What are you going to
tell Kayla and Jared?

28:05.130 --> 28:06.913
Nothing at this time.

28:11.869 --> 28:15.478
I-I hate lying to 'em,

28:15.521 --> 28:17.782
but I can't put 'em
through anything more.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.608
I understand.

28:19.652 --> 28:23.739
So... tonight, I will tell them

28:23.782 --> 28:26.391
that I have been called away,
out of town,

28:26.434 --> 28:28.521
on business, for a day or two.

28:32.652 --> 28:34.913
Don't worry.

28:34.956 --> 28:38.130
You know, the kids
will be all right.

28:38.173 --> 28:40.826
And so will you.

28:52.956 --> 28:55.347
Morning, Mrs. Wallace.

28:55.391 --> 28:57.739
This room looks
a lot less friendly

28:57.782 --> 29:00.173
than the one we met
in last time.
Well...

29:00.217 --> 29:01.304
don't read anything into it.

29:01.347 --> 29:02.347
Have a seat.

29:09.739 --> 29:13.478
Is our conversation
going to be recorded?

29:13.521 --> 29:15.000
Yes.

29:20.130 --> 29:21.782
TONY: You told us you and your
husband were separated,

29:21.826 --> 29:24.826
but working things out.

29:24.869 --> 29:26.304
Then you are not aware

29:26.347 --> 29:28.913
that he hired a lawyer
to draft divorce papers.

29:28.956 --> 29:30.478
[gasps]

29:30.521 --> 29:32.956
Where'd you get this?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.260
McGEE:
Your marital problems seem

29:34.304 --> 29:35.695
to have been
a little more serious

29:35.739 --> 29:36.956
than you led us to believe.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.478
What does this have to do

29:38.521 --> 29:39.956
with my husband being attacked?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.130
Do you know
who Courtney Reed is?

29:42.173 --> 29:44.347
[sighs]

29:44.391 --> 29:46.043
I know the name.

29:46.086 --> 29:47.826
She's an old girlfriend
of Ned's.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.086
They met at Annapolis.

29:50.130 --> 29:52.130
Why are you asking?

29:52.173 --> 29:54.347
They were seeing each other.

29:54.391 --> 29:57.304
McGEE: Your husband was a very
wealthy man, Mrs. Wallace.

29:57.347 --> 29:59.565
And we know that you signed
a pre-nuptial agreement.

29:59.608 --> 30:01.391
Yeah.

30:01.434 --> 30:03.826
If you were divorced
before your husband's death,

30:03.869 --> 30:05.956
you'd receive a fraction
of what you're gonna get now.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.347
Tell me, the morning of
your husband's murder,

30:09.391 --> 30:10.739
where were you?

30:10.782 --> 30:12.521
[laughs]

30:12.565 --> 30:14.782
You think I had something
to do with Ned's death?

30:20.000 --> 30:23.217
I am not saying any more
without a lawyer present.

30:25.956 --> 30:27.956
I'm leaving.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.347
I'll show you out.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.391
Hey, Francis.

30:47.434 --> 30:49.869
Hey. How's it going?
Fine.

30:49.913 --> 30:52.478
Can I ask you
a question, Bishop?

30:52.521 --> 30:54.478
Sure.

30:54.521 --> 30:55.956
You enjoy working for Gibbs?

30:56.000 --> 30:59.521
I mean, I heard he's tough,
real hard-ass.

31:01.695 --> 31:04.173
He's standing right behind me,
isn't he?

31:04.217 --> 31:05.913
Yeah.

31:10.826 --> 31:13.826
Don't you have someplace
else to be, Francis?

31:13.869 --> 31:15.608
Yes, sir.

31:18.521 --> 31:19.826
Bishop...

31:19.869 --> 31:21.000
Hmm?

31:21.043 --> 31:21.956
You called me.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.043
Yeah. Uh...

31:24.086 --> 31:25.347
So we knew Courtney Reed

31:25.391 --> 31:26.956
wasn't using her
credit cards.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.130
On a hunch , I checked
Commander Wallace's usage

31:29.173 --> 31:30.565
over the last few days.

31:30.608 --> 31:32.565
Now, on the night
before his murder,

31:32.608 --> 31:34.347
he booked an Annapolis
motel room

31:34.391 --> 31:35.869
for a "Regina Lampert."

31:35.913 --> 31:36.956
Regina Lampert?

31:37.000 --> 31:38.956
You know her?
Yeah.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.043
Well, it's an alias, boss.

31:40.086 --> 31:41.347
How do you know that?

31:41.391 --> 31:43.652
The 1963 film classic Charade,

31:43.695 --> 31:44.913
directed by Stanley Donen,

31:44.956 --> 31:46.826
starring Cary Grant
and Audrey Hepburn.

31:46.869 --> 31:48.739
Audrey Hepburn's character's
name was "Regina Lampert."

31:48.782 --> 31:50.217
Hmm.

31:50.260 --> 31:51.869
Uh, I called the motel,

31:51.913 --> 31:53.565
and a woman using that name

31:53.608 --> 31:54.869
and fitting Courtney
Reed's description,

31:54.913 --> 31:57.130
checked into her
hotel room two nights ago.

31:57.173 --> 31:59.695
Hmm.
TONY: So she
faked her own death?

31:59.739 --> 32:01.913
You think she and the wife
could be in on it together?

32:01.956 --> 32:03.086
The wife say something?

32:03.130 --> 32:05.304
No, no, she's lawyering up.

32:05.347 --> 32:07.086
[phone ringing]

32:07.130 --> 32:09.391
Uh, McGee's escorting her
downstairs.

32:10.739 --> 32:12.434
[ringing continues][Tony chuckles]

32:12.478 --> 32:13.913
Delilah, on the video chat.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.782
Oh, my God!

32:17.826 --> 32:18.869
You're very naked![Delilah screaming]

32:18.913 --> 32:20.347
Uh, sorry.

32:20.391 --> 32:21.695
Teach you not to answer

32:21.739 --> 32:22.782
other people's phones, DiNozzo.

32:24.086 --> 32:25.782
Get McGee.

32:25.826 --> 32:27.043
Go to the motel.

32:34.478 --> 32:36.086
Get over it, McGee.

32:36.130 --> 32:37.608
It was just a flash.

32:37.652 --> 32:38.956
Exactly what was
she flashing?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.521
What did you see?

32:40.565 --> 32:42.565
Enough to know you're
a very lucky dude, McGee.

32:42.608 --> 32:43.956
Let's leave it at that.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
I'll talk to the manager
and get a key.

32:47.913 --> 32:49.913
Tony.
McGee, can you just
leave it alone?

32:49.956 --> 32:51.739
No, Tony, that's her.

32:51.782 --> 32:54.260
Oh. Miss Reed, NCIS!

32:55.478 --> 32:57.826
NCIS!
Stop!

32:58.869 --> 32:59.869
TONY:
Go wide!

33:04.043 --> 33:06.478
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Look out!

33:13.217 --> 33:14.043
[tires screech]

33:14.086 --> 33:15.478
Hey! Fool!

33:19.695 --> 33:20.956
TONY:
Get her, McGee!

33:23.652 --> 33:25.782
No! Don't! Stop!

33:31.260 --> 33:33.130
TONY: Come on... come here...No! No! Let me go!

33:33.173 --> 33:34.913
No! No!

33:34.956 --> 33:36.304
Wow.
No! Please!

33:36.347 --> 33:37.782
Call the police!

33:37.826 --> 33:38.869
We are the police.

33:38.913 --> 33:39.913
Help!

33:45.956 --> 33:47.434
If you calm down,
we can take the cuffs off.

33:47.478 --> 33:49.043
But you have
to behave.

33:49.086 --> 33:51.043
Look, I don't believe
you are who you say you are.

33:51.086 --> 33:53.043
Badges and I.D.'s can be faked.

33:53.086 --> 33:54.478
I know who's after me.

33:54.521 --> 33:55.739
Who's after you,
Miss Reed?

33:55.782 --> 33:57.739
I'm not going anywhere
with you, okay?

33:57.782 --> 33:59.304
I'm not leaving a public area.

33:59.347 --> 34:00.521
[Tony sighs]

34:00.565 --> 34:02.304
We found your car
submerged in a river

34:02.347 --> 34:03.782
in Harford County, Maryland.

34:03.826 --> 34:05.304
How'd you get to the motel room?

34:05.347 --> 34:06.652
Your partner doesn't
get it, does he?

34:06.695 --> 34:08.347
I'm not telling
you guys anything.

34:08.391 --> 34:11.304
We know you called
Lieutenant Commander Wallace

34:11.347 --> 34:13.869
and we know he booked
your motel room for you.

34:13.913 --> 34:16.260
You know about Ned?

34:16.304 --> 34:18.043
No. No, no, no.

34:18.086 --> 34:19.739
He told me not
to talk to anyone,

34:19.782 --> 34:21.956
or tell anyone about anything,
and I'm not going to.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.304
He's dead.

34:27.391 --> 34:28.782
I don't believe you.

34:37.347 --> 34:39.347
Would you like a moment?

34:39.391 --> 34:40.739
[trembling]:
Mm-hmm.

34:46.434 --> 34:48.043
He never got to see
the president.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.521
No.

34:50.565 --> 34:52.000
[sighs]

34:53.565 --> 34:55.608
You and the commander
were close.

34:55.652 --> 34:58.652
He was getting divorced.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.000
We were going to get married.

35:08.608 --> 35:11.478
COURTNEY:
Colford-Webb has access
to tens of thousands

35:11.521 --> 35:13.565
of highly classified
government documents.

35:13.608 --> 35:17.217
I discovered their computer
system had a critical flaw

35:17.260 --> 35:19.000
which potentially
could expose

35:19.043 --> 35:20.347
those documents
to the public.

35:20.391 --> 35:22.434
Their firewall has a false door

35:22.478 --> 35:24.304
that any hacker
worth his salt could get into.

35:24.347 --> 35:26.956
I went to my immediate
superior, Bryce Tolson.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Mr. Tolson just wanted to

35:29.043 --> 35:30.608
make the fix and cover it up.

35:30.652 --> 35:32.391
If data was compromised,

35:32.434 --> 35:34.000
the scope of what Colford-Webb
had access to could make

35:34.043 --> 35:35.913
WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden
pale in comparison.

35:35.956 --> 35:38.043
COURTNEY:
She's right.

35:38.086 --> 35:40.478
Which is why I went above Tolson

35:40.521 --> 35:42.260
to the CEO, Richard Colford.

35:42.304 --> 35:44.043
He seemed concerned

35:44.086 --> 35:46.521
and he assured me that
he would get on it,

35:46.565 --> 35:47.782
but nothing was done.

35:47.826 --> 35:49.608
If it ever became
public knowledge,

35:49.652 --> 35:51.913
it would cost the company
billions of dollars

35:51.956 --> 35:55.086
in government contracts
and destroy its reputation.

35:55.130 --> 35:57.347
I started
getting paranoid.

35:57.391 --> 35:59.869
Tolson was excluding me
from meetings.

35:59.913 --> 36:02.260
He took away my access
to internal files.

36:02.304 --> 36:05.130
I... I thought
I was being followed.

36:07.478 --> 36:09.478
I think that's when
I made a tragic mistake.

36:10.739 --> 36:12.043
What was that?

36:12.086 --> 36:14.652
I called Ned
from my office phone.

36:14.695 --> 36:16.434
It must have
been bugged.

36:16.478 --> 36:17.478
That's what
got him killed.

36:17.521 --> 36:19.173
What did Commander Wallace say?

36:19.217 --> 36:21.652
He suggested that I hide
at my parents' cabin

36:21.695 --> 36:24.478
and not talk to
anyone until he phoned.

36:24.521 --> 36:27.173
I was on my way there
when a car ran me off the road.

36:27.217 --> 36:28.478
You get a look at it?

36:30.086 --> 36:31.347
No.

36:31.391 --> 36:33.391
It was pitch dark, I...

36:33.434 --> 36:35.652
I almost drowned.

36:35.695 --> 36:38.913
I don't even remember getting
out of the car, I was just...

36:38.956 --> 36:42.521
The... the current
dragged me downstream and I...

36:42.565 --> 36:46.086
I struggled to
get on the bank.

36:46.130 --> 36:48.478
Exhausted,
I got to the farmhouse

36:48.521 --> 36:50.782
and I called Ned
and he set me up

36:50.826 --> 36:52.521
at the motel room and...

36:52.565 --> 36:54.347
he told me that
he would call me there,

36:54.391 --> 36:55.695
after he spoke
to the president.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.869
[whispering]:
Told you it wasn't the wife.

37:00.913 --> 37:03.086
Haven't lost my touch.

37:14.521 --> 37:16.304
Tolson.

37:16.347 --> 37:17.956
You're
left-handed.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.565
[chuckles]
Special Agent Gibbs.

37:20.695 --> 37:22.652
Any luck finding Courtney?

37:22.695 --> 37:23.608
Oh, yeah.

37:44.304 --> 37:46.521
TONY: I... I'm so,
I'm so sorry.

37:46.565 --> 37:47.695
I'm so, so sorry.

37:47.739 --> 37:49.391
It was a terrible mistake.

37:51.565 --> 37:53.173
No, you're right, you're right.

37:53.217 --> 37:54.521
It never should've happened.

37:54.565 --> 37:56.043
Who's he talking to?

37:56.086 --> 37:57.521
Delilah.

37:57.565 --> 37:59.478
You're kidding.

37:59.521 --> 38:00.304
No.

38:00.347 --> 38:01.304
She was devastated.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.739
He called to apologize.

38:02.782 --> 38:04.347
Hm. You put him up to it?

38:04.391 --> 38:06.434
Nope.

38:06.478 --> 38:07.478
I understand how you must feel.

38:07.521 --> 38:09.130
But I...

38:09.173 --> 38:10.521
Delilah's one of those people

38:10.565 --> 38:12.347
you don't want to get
on her bad side.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.260
Ooh.

38:13.304 --> 38:14.478
Sounds like you've been there.

38:14.521 --> 38:16.086
Oh, yeah.

38:16.130 --> 38:17.043
TONY:
I understand.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.130
Loud and clear.

38:18.173 --> 38:20.782
I have
learned my lesson, Delilah.

38:20.826 --> 38:22.000
Yeah.

38:22.043 --> 38:23.000
Hey, Tim's right here.

38:23.043 --> 38:24.000
You want to talk to him?

38:24.043 --> 38:27.043
Okay. I'll...

38:27.086 --> 38:28.521
I'll tell him.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.913
Whew!

38:31.956 --> 38:33.217
Glad that's over.

38:33.260 --> 38:34.478
She said she'll...

38:34.521 --> 38:36.695
call you later.

38:36.739 --> 38:38.478
We know what that means.

38:38.521 --> 38:41.217
See, you didn't learn
your lesson at all.BISHOP: No.

38:41.260 --> 38:42.434
He'll never change.

38:42.478 --> 38:44.217
Hey, guys.

38:44.260 --> 38:45.347
Hey.Hi.

38:46.304 --> 38:48.521
Anybody seen Gibbs?Uh... no.

38:48.565 --> 38:50.086
Hey, you go out with
the park ranger yet?

38:50.130 --> 38:51.521
No.Why not?

38:51.565 --> 38:53.478
I can't put my finger on it.

38:53.521 --> 38:55.173
Something just...

38:56.434 --> 38:58.434
Maybe he's too good-looking.

38:58.478 --> 39:00.347
Maybe that's my problem.

39:00.391 --> 39:04.086
But you are gonna
go out with him, aren't you?

39:04.130 --> 39:06.304
Yeah.

39:06.347 --> 39:08.043
Is something going on here
that I don't know about,

39:08.086 --> 39:09.826
because Gibbs and Ducky
are usually here by now,

39:09.869 --> 39:11.434
and I can't find
either one of them.

39:17.304 --> 39:18.739
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Dr. Olson, Dialysis.

39:18.782 --> 39:20.260
Dr. Olson, Dialysis.

39:20.304 --> 39:21.608
[muffled conversation]

39:24.478 --> 39:26.521
Hi, Kayla.Where's my father?

39:26.565 --> 39:29.347
They just moved him from
recovery to a private room.

39:29.391 --> 39:30.521
Do you know anything yet?

39:30.565 --> 39:32.478
Nah.

39:32.521 --> 39:35.217
Dr. Mallard's talking
to the surgeon right now.

39:37.521 --> 39:39.304
Please be good news.

39:47.391 --> 39:48.739
[chuckles]

39:50.478 --> 39:52.043
He's going to be fine.

39:52.086 --> 39:53.478
Really?

39:53.521 --> 39:55.086
There's... there's nothing
wrong with him?

39:55.130 --> 39:57.260
No, Kayla, nothing serious.

39:57.304 --> 39:59.304
What is it?

39:59.347 --> 40:01.347
Well, the biopsy revealed

40:01.391 --> 40:03.043
the spots on your father's lungs

40:03.086 --> 40:06.434
are not lymphoma,
but rather sarcoidosis.

40:06.478 --> 40:09.130
It's a viral condition

40:09.173 --> 40:12.869
that mimics cancer
on CAT scans and X-rays.

40:12.913 --> 40:14.130
So it's not cancer.

40:14.173 --> 40:15.478
No.

40:15.521 --> 40:17.652
Thank God.

40:17.695 --> 40:18.695
It require treatment?

40:18.739 --> 40:20.478
In most cases, no.

40:20.521 --> 40:22.782
So... can I see him?

40:29.086 --> 40:30.434
Daddy?

40:33.695 --> 40:35.695
Kayla, why aren't
you in school?

40:37.000 --> 40:38.652
She overheard me

40:38.695 --> 40:40.956
talking to Dr. Mallard
on the phone last night.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.043
I thought she
was asleep.

40:45.478 --> 40:46.956
You should have told me.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.173
I'm the woman of the house now.

40:49.217 --> 40:50.478
I'm strong,

40:50.521 --> 40:51.608
like Mom was.

40:53.086 --> 40:54.521
Did you tell your brother?

40:54.565 --> 40:56.521
No, he's too young.

40:56.565 --> 40:58.217
I didn't think
he could handle it.

40:58.260 --> 41:00.260
You are your mother.

41:05.565 --> 41:07.478
Hey.

41:07.521 --> 41:08.521
Hey, you.

41:08.565 --> 41:10.608
How you feeling?

41:10.652 --> 41:13.608
Mmm... a little sore from...

41:13.652 --> 41:15.130
from where they cut into me.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.956
But I'm... I'm relieved.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.391
You are gonna have
to take it easy for a while.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.043
Yeah, you better, Daddy.

41:22.086 --> 41:24.869
I'll check in on him.
Make sure he does.

41:24.913 --> 41:26.608
He gives me any trouble,
I'll let you know.

41:26.652 --> 41:28.478
Okay.
