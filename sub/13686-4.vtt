"Ex on the Beach."

00:03.703 --> 00:05.338
As if having his ex,
Chelsko, in the house

00:05.405 --> 00:08.007
wasn't bad enough,
his second ex, Haley,

00:08.074 --> 00:10.110
just hit the beach
like a tsunami.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.778
I'm happy you're here.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.546

Cory's ex, Alicia,
blindsided him

00:16.349 --> 00:19.085
and his current boo, Taylor,
in the Shack of Secrets.

00:19.152 --> 00:20.820
{\an1}I feel like
a (bleep) idiot!

00:20.887 --> 00:25.024
Chase grew tired of filling
Skyler's bottomless red cup.

00:25.091 --> 00:26.693
Skyler, you are
hammered.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.096
Tor'i stepped out on Angela
and took a shot on Faith.

00:30.163 --> 00:32.598
Oh, it's right
there, ahh!

00:32.665 --> 00:34.667
Chris tried to manipulate
the vote

00:34.734 --> 00:37.137
to eliminate
his first ex, Chelsko,

00:37.203 --> 00:40.173
so he could get closer
to his second ex, Haley.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.441
(Chris)
I have two exes in here,

00:41.508 --> 00:43.476
and I want Chels to get
the (bleep) out.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.945
{\an5}(announcer)
And before elimination
could even start,

00:46.012 --> 00:49.315
Angela found out what happened
on Tor'i's date with Faith.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.785
{\an5}What about--

00:49.382 --> 00:51.785
Body shots, but not here.

00:51.851 --> 00:53.186
{\an3}Body shots.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.889
Throwing everything
into chaos.

Oh, yeah,
I swear, I swear!

00:58.258 --> 01:00.226
{\an8}And tonight, we conclude

01:00.293 --> 01:02.228
{\an8}the most dramatic
elimination yet.

01:02.295 --> 01:04.431
{\an7}Come up at me tough,
I swear!

01:06.399 --> 01:09.302
And later, Victoria
and Skyler find themselves

01:09.369 --> 01:12.205
fighting over the same man
yet again.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.406
This is why I want
to talk sober

01:13.473 --> 01:15.208
'cause you're saying
the wrong (bleep)!

{\an8}But their exes
had other plans.

01:29.088 --> 01:32.792
{\an8}Now they have the power
to vote them out of the house

08:30.543 --> 08:32.178
You had enough time
to tell Cory

08:32.245 --> 08:33.880
but you didn't have
enough time to tell me?

08:33.946 --> 08:35.313
You're a (bleep).
You're a (bleep) fake.

08:35.381 --> 08:38.083
{\an4}Yeah!

Yeah, yeah, you're
a (bleep) fake.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.852
That's you, that's you.
Why you acting like that?

08:39.919 --> 08:41.587
{\an5}Why are you always...

08:39.919 --> 08:41.587
You're a joke.

{\an5}No, no.

08:41.654 --> 08:42.788
You're a joke, bro.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.524

with my (bleep) ex.

08:44.590 --> 08:45.925
Yeah, you gonna keep
saying that,

08:45.992 --> 08:48.494
because you're trying
to hurt me

08:48.561 --> 08:50.029

throwing shots my way.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.999

with other people
in this house.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.502
{\an4}Why? Why?

08:54.901 --> 08:56.502
And I'm gonna get you back.

08:56.569 --> 08:57.570
And I'm gonna get you
back for that.

08:57.637 --> 08:58.738
{\an4}Why, yo?

08:57.637 --> 08:58.738
{\an3}You bet.

08:58.804 --> 09:00.373
From here on,
I'm gonna go

09:00.439 --> 09:01.741
out of my way
to hurt you.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.709
(bleep) lying-ass
piece of (bleep).

09:06.379 --> 09:10.116
{\an8}The whole Faith
and Tor'i date.

09:10.182 --> 09:12.785
And, no, no, Angela knew.
Pfft! Like...

09:12.852 --> 09:14.120
If you're
gonna be real,

09:14.186 --> 09:15.788

Let me in!

09:19.191 --> 09:22.995
{\an5}Oh, wow.

09:19.191 --> 09:22.995
You're supposed
to wait for me.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.998
You're talking
to the-- the devil.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.768
You're supposed to wait.
Move over, (bleep).

09:28.834 --> 09:31.671
{\an6}So selfish.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.671

{\an5}(announcer)
Welcome back
to "Ex on the Beach."

10:08.207 --> 10:11.210
Angela called it quits on
her and Tor'i's relationship

10:11.277 --> 10:14.613
and ended up in the arms
of her ex, Derrick.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.282
But it looks like Chris

10:16.349 --> 10:18.617
is taking
this breakup the hardest.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.286
{\an5}This ain't cool, bro.

10:33.165 --> 10:36.769
{\an8}I've never seen this many people
cry on a dating show.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.904
I'm just glad
I'm not with Angela.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.441
I (bleep) with T
so hard, bro.

10:42.508 --> 10:43.976
I (bleep) with T so hard,

10:44.043 --> 10:45.778
and it's not cool
she's doing this (bleep).

10:45.845 --> 10:47.079
I know, but this is
the thing, though--

10:47.146 --> 10:49.415
{\an5}It's not cool, bro!

10:47.146 --> 10:49.415
No, but it's reasonable.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.550
{\an5}It's reasonable.

11:12.872 --> 11:15.241
{\an1}I'm literally
single now.

11:15.307 --> 11:16.575
{\an6}Okay.

11:15.307 --> 11:16.575
{\an1}Okay.

11:16.642 --> 11:17.743
{\an1}So I can do
whatever I want.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.145
{\an6}True, true.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.145
I can kiss you.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.746
{\an5}I can kiss whoever
the (bleep) I want.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.746
{\an3}You can.

11:20.813 --> 11:23.015
But don't do (bleep)
to lead me on

11:23.082 --> 11:25.418
{\an5}'cause you're feeling
some type of way
about him.

11:25.484 --> 11:26.719
{\an1}So, okay,
then I won't...

11:26.786 --> 11:29.055
Us kissing brings back
those feelings.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.057
{\an1}Okay, then it won't
happen again.

11:31.123 --> 11:32.792
{\an4}I already got caught up
in your bull(bleep)
once before,

11:32.858 --> 11:34.260
and that didn't
do me any good.

11:34.326 --> 11:36.128
{\an8}(Derrick)
After this make-out,

11:36.195 --> 11:37.797
{\an8}I can kind of get the vibe
that the kiss might have been

11:37.863 --> 11:39.231
{\an8}out of her trying to
be spiteful,

11:39.298 --> 11:42.301
{\an8}so I'm gonna keep
my distance.

11:44.603 --> 11:46.539
Let's chat.

11:46.605 --> 11:49.275
{\an8}I... am disappointed

11:49.341 --> 11:51.710
{\an8}that I didn't get a crush
from Chase,

11:51.777 --> 11:53.145
{\an8}and that really hurt me.

11:56.015 --> 11:59.718
I mean, it's embarrassing
every time you party.

11:59.785 --> 12:02.154
{\an5}I'm embarrassing you?

11:59.785 --> 12:02.154
I was embarrassed.

12:02.221 --> 12:06.392
{\an8}Skyler seems like the conductor

12:06.459 --> 12:08.160
{\an8}All aboard!

and the kind of girl
that I'm looking for,

12:11.163 --> 12:14.600
that's not her sole focus
is to drink, party, eat.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.769
I am still like
a (bleep) woman

12:16.836 --> 12:18.304
{\an1}and I can make
my own decisions...

12:18.370 --> 12:20.773
{\an5}I'm not saying
you can't make
that decision,

12:20.840 --> 12:24.677
{\an5}but I'm saying
that that is not
attractive to me.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.378
Then it's done.

12:26.445 --> 12:29.315
You and I are done.

Hey, money!

16:21.780 --> 16:23.582
{\an4}(bleep)!

16:21.780 --> 16:23.582
What up, dude?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.584
{\an4}Hi, I'm Cam.
Nice to meet you.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.584
Nice to meet you.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.319
{\an5}Hi, Cameron.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.319
Hi, Skyler.
Nice to meet you.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.855
{\an5}Hi, I'm Jasmine.
How are you?

16:27.386 --> 16:29.855
{\an1}Hi, good.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.290
{\an8}(Skyler)
Cameron walks in,

16:31.357 --> 16:33.459
{\an8}and immediately
I'm attracted to him.

16:33.525 --> 16:36.862
{\an8}He literally looks like
both of my ex-boyfriends.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.964
{\an8}He is fine!

16:39.031 --> 16:41.767
{\an8}(announcer)
Looks like you girls
are about to find yourself

16:41.834 --> 16:43.736
{\an8}in another love triangle.

16:43.802 --> 16:47.439
{\an8}Coming up, Victoria
claps back at Skyler.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.509
{\an1}If anything, you've done
more wrong to me than I have.

16:50.576 --> 16:51.677
What is that to you?

16:51.744 --> 16:53.412
I didn't know you
existed on planet Earth.

16:53.479 --> 16:57.282
And DJ Chris can't find
the right song for Haley.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.519
I wanna call you babe,
and you don't let me.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.395
{\an5}(announcer)
Taylor's second ex, Cameron,
arrived in the villa,

17:09.461 --> 17:11.130
and the women are
sizing him up,

17:11.195 --> 17:15.000
but he has unfinished
business with Taylor.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.835
{\an1}Hey, can I talk to you
real quick?

17:16.902 --> 17:18.704
{\an3}Yeah.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.606
Oh, he's-- he's weak.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.441
{\an5}(Chris)
He's got
nothing on you.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.441
{\an1}Yeah.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.710
{\an5}He came in like this.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.710
{\an1}Yeah, no.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.412
Like a damn snake!

17:26.478 --> 17:28.380
He don't got
nothing on me.

17:28.446 --> 17:30.616
He seems pretty basic.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.919
How fast
did that happen?

17:33.986 --> 17:35.654
{\an4}Day one.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.654
{\an3}Day one!

17:35.721 --> 17:36.889
{\an1}Day one.

17:36.955 --> 17:38.190
I don't even know
how it happened.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.559
{\an1}Like, it just did.
I'm with Cory.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.862
{\an5}Like, I want to see
that through, um...

17:40.626 --> 17:43.862
{\an3}Right.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.130
{\an3}I'm happy.

17:45.197 --> 17:47.332
I'm happy we're both
(bleep) mature enough...

17:47.399 --> 17:48.867
{\an1}To deal with this
like adults?

17:48.934 --> 17:50.035
Yeah, yeah.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.035
{\an3}Yeah.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.703
Like, hey, we had
a good time.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.338
I'm gonna go this way.

17:55.073 --> 17:57.576
{\an1}I'm not gonna lie.
Like, I...

17:57.643 --> 18:00.646
{\an1}I'm actually, like,
intrigued by Cameron.

18:00.712 --> 18:04.249
I think that the only
two people in this house

18:04.316 --> 18:06.051
{\an5}that actually, like,
want him are you
and Victoria.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.654
{\an5}So it's like that's
what you kind of
have to worry about.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.456
I don't care.

18:10.522 --> 18:12.357
{\an8}(Angela)
I'm like, girl, back off.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.526
{\an8}Let Victoria have some love.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.728
{\an1}I do wanna build
a connection with somebody.

18:16.795 --> 18:19.231
Skyler does not stand
a chance against Victoria.

18:19.298 --> 18:21.166
Victoria is
a little firecracker.

18:21.233 --> 18:22.634
That's my girl.

18:22.701 --> 18:24.269
I wanted to see
where her head was at,

18:24.336 --> 18:26.438
about, like, if she
likes him or not.

18:26.505 --> 18:29.308
{\an5}She's gonna go for it.

18:26.505 --> 18:29.308
{\an1}Oh, Lord.

18:29.374 --> 18:30.375
I mean, it's-- She--

18:30.442 --> 18:33.178
She already knew
that you guys

18:33.245 --> 18:36.114
{\an5}were both going
for the same guy
as a thing.

18:36.181 --> 18:37.282
So you gotta get
to know him.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.051
She's gotta get
to know him.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.652
{\an5}(Victoria)
Chase is no longer giving her
the attention

18:40.719 --> 18:42.554
that he was giving her
in the beginning.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.456
{\an8}Just because you're not
getting any attention

18:44.523 --> 18:45.991
{\an8}from the guys in the house
does not mean

18:46.058 --> 18:48.460
{\an8}you should start
going after Cameron.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.295
{\an7}(Haley)
So we out here
doing our thing.

18:50.362 --> 18:52.698
{\an8}I'm really feeling it.

18:50.362 --> 18:52.698
{\an7}Yeah.

18:52.764 --> 18:54.333
{\an8}(Derrick)
Angela and I kissed
last night,

18:54.399 --> 18:55.901
{\an8}but Haley's
definitely my type

18:55.968 --> 18:57.970
{\an8}with the blonde hairs,
the eyes, and that booty.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.738
{\an8}(whistles)

18:59.805 --> 19:01.340
{\an1}Like, I'm willing
to see where it goes

19:01.406 --> 19:02.541
{\an1}and start, like--
If we have a conversation,

19:02.608 --> 19:03.976
{\an1}I think it could
go somewhere.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.777
{\an5}Let's play it out.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.777
{\an1}All right,
let's play it out.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.246
{\an5}Yeah, let's play it out.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.246
We'll get there.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.714
Continue to get
to know each other.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.282
{\an5}That's what I'm saying.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.282
See where things at.

19:10.349 --> 19:11.617
(indistinct chatter)

19:11.683 --> 19:13.619
(Chris)
Haley and Derrick...

19:13.685 --> 19:15.320
they're hugging
and (bleep).

19:15.387 --> 19:17.356
I'm like, okay, like, y'all
(bleep) know each other.

19:17.422 --> 19:20.359
{\an8}You know, like, excuse me?

19:20.425 --> 19:22.628
{\an5}I'm feeling good.

19:20.425 --> 19:22.628
{\an1}We're doing
this whole side hug.

19:22.694 --> 19:25.430
{\an8}Yeah. No, it ain't side,
no, it ain't side.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.301
{\an8}I'm definitely
attracted to Derrick.

19:29.368 --> 19:30.702
{\an8}He's the usual type
that I go for.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.504
He's funny,
he's outgoing.

19:32.571 --> 19:33.872
He has a free spirit,

19:33.939 --> 19:35.841
and I think Chris
is threatened by him.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.079
{\an8}I told you
why I was here.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.848
{\an8}I was here to
fix things with you.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.784
{\an8}I told you originally
I came in the situation
not knowing what it was.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.286
{\an8}I didn't come here--

19:50.455 --> 19:52.858
{\an8}I told him where I was at.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.858
{\an8}Chelsea, look.

19:52.925 --> 19:56.795
{\an5}(announcer)
Uh, Chris, Chelsko's the ex
you got rid of last night.

19:56.862 --> 19:57.930
That's Haley.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.398
{\an8}(bleep)!

19:59.464 --> 20:02.501
{\an1}I told you,
I'm not for the games.

20:02.568 --> 20:05.404
{\an4}And if you want to respect me
and not laugh in my face,
that'd be appreciated.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.072
I'm not laughing
in your (bleep) face.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.840
Do you not see me
sitting here crying?

20:08.907 --> 20:10.409
{\an5}I'm being serious.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.409
I'm not laughing
in your (bleep) face.

20:10.475 --> 20:11.910
{\an5}I'm being serious.

20:10.475 --> 20:11.910
I'm over it.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.478
When you want to calm down,
we can have a conversation.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.248
{\an1}And I know you want--
No-- What the (bleep)?!

20:16.315 --> 20:18.951
{\an7}I mean, why you
walking away, Haley?

20:19.017 --> 20:20.152
{\an7}Haley!

20:19.017 --> 20:20.152
{\an9}I'm done.

20:20.218 --> 20:22.220
{\an5}Why you walking away?

20:20.218 --> 20:22.220
'Cause I'm done.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.755
{\an6}I'm done!

20:22.287 --> 20:23.755
{\an1}Haley!

20:23.822 --> 20:24.756
What the (bleep)?!

20:24.823 --> 20:25.824
Damn.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.259
Chris is very sensitive,

20:27.326 --> 20:30.462
and watching them fight
over Derrick is so ridiculous.

20:30.529 --> 20:32.197
It's so hard not to
just sit back

20:32.264 --> 20:33.999
and just eat your popcorn.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.267
{\an8}I'm over it!

20:34.066 --> 20:35.267
{\an9}I'm here--

20:35.334 --> 20:36.702
{\an8}I don't want to have
this (bleep) conver--

20:36.768 --> 20:38.537
{\an4}Stop trying
to call me Chelsea!

20:36.768 --> 20:38.537
{\an3}I didn't.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.405
{\an1}You've called me Chelsea
four (bleep) times!

20:40.472 --> 20:41.974
I didn't just
call you Chelsea.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.810
{\an8}(announcer)
All right, roll the tape
back, please.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.712
{\an8}And from another angle.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.013
{\an8}I don't want to have
this (bleep) conver--

20:48.080 --> 20:49.514
{\an1}Stop trying
to call me Chelsea!

20:49.581 --> 20:51.883
{\an1}I was about to say "shorty"
instead of Chelsea.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.285
{\an5}No, you weren't,
no, you were not!

20:51.950 --> 20:53.285
I was gonna say it, too.

20:53.352 --> 20:54.953
{\an5}No, you were not!

20:53.352 --> 20:54.953
Are you listening?

20:55.020 --> 20:56.421
{\an1}No, I'm not (bleep)
listening,

20:56.488 --> 20:57.789
'cause I don't want
to do this with you!

20:57.856 --> 20:59.858
{\an1}Okay, so that's the problem,
that's the problem.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.994
{\an8}Haley and I didn't even
make out or anything,

21:02.060 --> 21:03.462
{\an8}and, like, calm down, bro.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.230
Like, it's not
that big of a deal.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.966
{\an5}Y'all know everybody
love some chocolate.
Like come on, now.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.701
You just said you don't
want to talk about it.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.638
{\an4}'Cause leave me alone
and don't talk
about it with me!

21:12.704 --> 21:14.773
{\an5}But look at you!

21:12.704 --> 21:14.773
Send me home!

21:14.840 --> 21:16.274
{\an5}Send me home.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.274
I'm not going to.

21:16.341 --> 21:18.677
{\an1}Send me the (bleep) home.
I'm (bleep) over it.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.412
{\an5}Like, leave, leave.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.412
You just hit me, bro.

21:26.284 --> 21:27.419
{\an5}What happened?

21:26.284 --> 21:27.419
{\an1}You okay?

21:27.486 --> 21:29.054
(crying)
There's a reason he's my ex.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.288
He cheated on me
multiple times!

21:30.355 --> 21:31.823
{\an4}(Chris)
She's playing
with people!

21:31.890 --> 21:34.626
{\an1}I'm about to that (bleep)
straight, for everyone to know.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.999
{\an8}Well, (bleep)
just not serious.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.834
I ain't playin'!

21:44.369 --> 21:45.837
{\an8}(Haley)
My name is Haley, not Chelsea.

21:45.904 --> 21:47.706
I do that
'cause you hate it.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.174
I do it 'cause
you hate it.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.077
{\an4}(Haley)
He has called me Chelsea
four times tonight!

21:52.144 --> 21:54.813
{\an8}Whoo! Child!

21:54.880 --> 21:57.549
{\an8}This is good (bleep)!
Good, it's so good!

21:57.616 --> 22:01.153
I don't know when it's
gonna be clear enough to you

22:01.219 --> 22:03.121
{\an5}that I (bleep) want you.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.121
{\an1}I get it.

22:03.188 --> 22:04.556
(crying)
I don't know when...

22:04.623 --> 22:07.926
I wanna call you babe,
and you don't let me.

22:07.993 --> 22:08.927
{\an1}Come here.
It's fine.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.562
You don't let me.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.565
{\an5}(announcer)
Are you sure ya don't
wanna call her Chelsea?

22:13.632 --> 22:15.600
{\an5}You don't let me.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.600
I'm trying to.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.069
{\an7}I'm trying to get there
with you, Chris.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.143
{\an1}You want me to comfort you
every time,

22:25.210 --> 22:27.446
{\an1}and then when I try to,
you (bleep) walk away from me.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.481
I'm trying to comfort you
and I'm trying to be here.

22:29.548 --> 22:31.483
I'm trying to hug you.

22:33.485 --> 22:35.854
(crying softly)

22:35.921 --> 22:37.756
(announcer)
Aw, how sweet.

22:37.823 --> 22:39.691
Meanwhile, things
are turning sour

22:39.758 --> 22:41.960
for Victoria and Skyler
in the house.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.066
{\an8}Get out of the way, bitch.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.769
{\an8}For once, please,
just get out of the way.

22:50.836 --> 22:53.271
{\an1}I don't feel like
even having a conversation,

22:53.338 --> 22:55.474
but if you insist...

23:05.884 --> 23:07.119
{\an8}I just don't wanna
feel disrespected

23:07.185 --> 23:08.520
{\an8}when I made it
clear to you.

23:08.587 --> 23:10.422
{\an8}(Cameron)
I just feel like
a piece of meat.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.224
{\an8}It is hard to make
Cameron uncomfortable.

23:12.290 --> 23:15.994
{\an8}You made me uncomfortable
in, like, .5 seconds.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.129
I'm not feeling it.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.730
{\an1}You could see
who you wanna see

23:18.797 --> 23:20.766
{\an4}or you could be
attracted to who you
wanna be attracted to.

23:20.832 --> 23:22.334
{\an1}But when it comes
down to it, if you said,

23:22.400 --> 23:25.270
"I'm aware she's interested,
but I'm going for it anyway."

23:25.337 --> 23:26.972
{\an1}That-- that annoys me.
It really does.

23:27.038 --> 23:29.775
{\an8}I gave Skyler a chance,
but once you let it known

23:29.841 --> 23:31.176
{\an8}than you don't care
about my feelings

23:31.243 --> 23:32.944
{\an8}and you're just gonna
overstep them anyway,

23:33.011 --> 23:34.546

23:34.613 --> 23:36.014

(bleep)-talking

23:36.081 --> 23:39.451

quarter inch of this place.

23:39.518 --> 23:40.986

23:43.688 --> 23:45.023

23:45.090 --> 23:46.625
{\an8}You probably have a chance,

23:46.691 --> 23:48.994

for yourselves.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.229

look me in the eye.

23:51.296 --> 23:52.597

23:52.664 --> 23:53.765

intimidating.

23:53.832 --> 23:55.267
{\an5}Well, like--

{\an1}If I have something to say,
I'm gonna tell you straight up.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.743
{\an4}Okay.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.743
And I've been straight up
with you since day one.

24:04.810 --> 24:05.844
{\an3}Okay.

Skyler and I are headed.

24:10.415 --> 24:12.417

24:25.931 --> 24:27.499

I feel betrayed.

39:46.283 --> 39:48.085
I feel hurt.

39:52.623 --> 39:54.425

{\an5}It's tough.

40:30.561 --> 40:32.630
It's just horrible.

40:32.696 --> 40:34.265
{\an8}When I see Chase crying,

40:34.331 --> 40:35.499
{\an8}it makes me wanna cry.

40:35.566 --> 40:36.901
{\an8}It's sad.

I'm really taken aback

40:49.947 --> 40:51.849
{\an8}by the fact that Chase
voted me out tonight.

40:51.916 --> 40:54.351
{\an8}The opportunity
was there, and...

40:54.418 --> 40:56.821
{\an8}he didn't wanna take it, so...

40:56.887 --> 40:58.789
{\an8}Chase, by you
doing that tonight,

40:58.856 --> 41:00.791
{\an8}you said everything that
you needed to say.

41:00.858 --> 41:02.493
{\an8}As far as right now, Chase,

41:02.560 --> 41:04.929
{\an8}I really don't have
any words for you.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.132
{\an8}That's a wrap for me.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.500
{\an8}And...

41:09.567 --> 41:12.903
