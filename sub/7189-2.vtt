17:28.714 --> 17:30.340
So...

17:30.424 --> 17:34.136
you think I'm going to be
so moved by this

17:34.219 --> 17:38.265
sad, sad show of solidarity
that, uh,

17:38.348 --> 17:41.143
I won't punish anyone?

17:43.520 --> 17:46.774
- And this, this is
your great Aunt Magdalene,

17:46.857 --> 17:48.650
famous for starting the first
witch coven in America.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.153
- Boring.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.155
- Maddie, you have to know this.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.323
- What for?

17:54.406 --> 17:56.575
I just want to cast some spells,
you know?

17:56.658 --> 17:57.284
Get my evil on.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.246
- You will.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.081
But first, there are many things
you have to learn.

18:03.165 --> 18:07.669
To do,
you must first understand.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.964
Oh, I've wanted
to say that for years.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.508
- Yeah, yeah.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.134
There's this book
called <i> The Hexerin,</i>

18:14.218 --> 18:14.968
and if you have it
during the eclipse,

18:15.052 --> 18:16.762
you can become the Chosen One.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.013
- Mm-hmm.
- Whatevs.

18:18.096 --> 18:21.016
How do you know
I'm not the Chosen One?

18:21.099 --> 18:22.518
- Well, for one thing,

18:22.601 --> 18:26.021
you don't have the telltale
star-shaped birthmark.

18:26.105 --> 18:26.522
Trust me, I looked.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.398
- [gasps]

18:30.275 --> 18:32.027
- Just be careful,
all right?

18:32.110 --> 18:34.196
Okay, so, um, no crazy hair,

18:34.279 --> 18:40.118
no giant facial feature,
and no sequined pants.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.412
- Okay.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.748
Don't...move.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.208
- Okay, wait, wait.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.712
Okay, go.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.131
- Andi, I'll lose
my concentration.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.134
Stand back.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.598
- Okay, Maddie, let's recap.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.810
In 1600,
your great great great

19:04.893 --> 19:08.355
great great great great
grandmother Alita

19:08.438 --> 19:12.734
discovered <i> The Hexerin,</i>
which is...

19:12.818 --> 19:13.735
- A book?

19:13.819 --> 19:14.778
- Oh, Maddie Winky!

19:14.862 --> 19:17.239
You know what,
fine.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.282
Apparently, you don't want
to find <i> The Hexerin</i>

19:18.365 --> 19:20.409
and steal
the Chosen One's powers

19:20.492 --> 19:20.909
during the upcoming eclipse.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.703
Whatever.

19:22.786 --> 19:23.996
- I'm busy that night.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.582
Besides, I already have powers.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.458
- Changing your friend's
hair color?

19:29.877 --> 19:31.211
[whispering]
That is nothing compared with

19:31.295 --> 19:34.631
what you could do if you stole
the Chosen One's powers.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.340
- [whispering] Fine.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.301
What do I have to do?

19:37.384 --> 19:40.762
- The first thing we have to do
is find <i> The Hexerin.</i>

19:40.846 --> 19:42.764
But we're in luck,
because it's rumored to be

19:42.848 --> 19:45.642
with another witch
right here in Miami.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.185
- There are other witches
in Miami?

19:47.269 --> 19:48.604
- Shh.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.105
Not too many, no.

19:50.188 --> 19:52.357
Which is why
there's a good chance

19:52.441 --> 19:55.152
it's with that new girl, Emma.

19:55.235 --> 19:55.319
[both gasp]

19:57.738 --> 19:58.780
[both squeal]

19:59.531 --> 20:01.116
- Andi has red highlights.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.371
Andi has purple sneakers.

20:09.082 --> 20:12.002
- Uh, come on, you just have
to really mean it.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.172
- Andi has sequined pants.

20:16.340 --> 20:16.798
- Ha-ha.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.635
Concentrate.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.474
- I would like
a brand-new phone,

20:25.557 --> 20:30.187
a jewel-encrusted
golden phone.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.356
- Okay.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.359
Um, using the same word twice

20:35.442 --> 20:36.652
isn't rhyming.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.363
Try harder.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.405
Concentrate.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.992
- Pink sweater,
laptop, jet ski.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.452
- Oh, I like
where this is going.

20:47.996 --> 20:52.000
- North, south, east, west,
Iridium Panthers are the best.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.003
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

20:56.505 --> 20:59.466
- Girls, dinner's ready.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.430
- This isn't working.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.557
What are we missing?

21:07.641 --> 21:08.684
- [sighs]

21:09.893 --> 21:11.645
In the bathroom,
Maddie said something

21:11.728 --> 21:14.189
about spells having a rhyme.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.360
Maybe I should try that.

21:18.443 --> 21:21.780
- Well, as rule, I wouldn't
try anything Maddie does,

21:21.863 --> 21:23.490
but go for it.

21:25.617 --> 21:29.413
- Seems a little obvious,
but...

21:29.496 --> 21:33.208
cherry sprinkles,
ice cream float,

21:33.291 --> 21:36.670
turn Andi into a goat.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.801
Oh, she was right.
It worked.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.386
It's a...
[gasps]

21:44.469 --> 21:45.762
Oh, she was right.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.140
It worked.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.184
- Emma?

21:51.268 --> 21:52.144
[knocking on door]

21:52.227 --> 21:52.894
<i>Emma, you girls okay?</i>

21:52.978 --> 21:55.439
- Uh, we're fine.
