WEBVTT

00:11.433 --> 00:14.200
- Ah! Ha ha!

00:15.433 --> 00:16.700
- Hey hey, turn!
Turn!

00:16.800 --> 00:18.200
- Your otter's gonna
hit the moon!

00:18.300 --> 00:19.900
- Uh, my otter is not
gonna hit the moon.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.609
- Dude, your otter is
going straight for it!

00:21.633 --> 00:23.443
- I'm a professional gamer.
I know what I'm doing.

00:23.467 --> 00:24.943
- Trip I'm telling you.
It's about to hit the moon.

00:24.967 --> 00:26.367
- My otter is not
going to hit th...

00:30.833 --> 00:33.200
My otter hit the moon.

00:35.433 --> 00:37.667
- It's okay,
just tap the space hose

00:37.767 --> 00:38.800
and rinse him off.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.600
- Space hose?!?

00:42.267 --> 00:43.627
- Yeah, uh, there,
just tap there.

00:43.667 --> 00:46.067
- Oh.

00:46.167 --> 00:48.933
- Yeah baby.
- Oh oh oh, hose that moon.

00:50.433 --> 00:51.900
- Okay, let's email
the Pear people

00:52.000 --> 00:53.600
and see if "Space Hose"
is available.

00:53.700 --> 00:56.233
- 'Kay, I'll email everyone
on the marketing team.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.333
- Hey...

01:00.433 --> 01:02.767
your fingernails
look really nice.

01:02.867 --> 01:04.900
- Uh, no they dont.

01:05.067 --> 01:06.367
- Do you get manicures?

01:06.467 --> 01:09.067
- No! No.

01:09.167 --> 01:11.567
- Trip gets manicures!

01:11.667 --> 01:13.167
- Okay, okay.
So?!? So?!?

01:13.267 --> 01:14.933
There's nothing wrong
with a young man

01:15.067 --> 01:16.967
gettin' his nails done.

01:17.067 --> 01:20.067
Please don't tell the guys!

01:21.267 --> 01:22.867
- Aw man.

01:22.967 --> 01:24.309
- What's wrong?
Did you send the emails?

01:24.333 --> 01:26.067
- Yeah, but the whole
marketing department

01:26.167 --> 01:28.667
is out of the office
for an off-site.

01:28.767 --> 01:29.967
- What's an off-site?

01:30.067 --> 01:31.533
- Ah, it's just a dumb excuse

01:31.633 --> 01:33.133
that grown-ups with boring jobs

01:33.233 --> 01:35.400
use to take pointless vacations.

01:37.067 --> 01:38.400
- Nooo, that's not true.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.309
Off-sites are a chance
for people that work together

01:40.333 --> 01:41.800
to get away from their office,

01:41.900 --> 01:43.043
so they can get to know
each other better.

01:43.067 --> 01:44.667
- And why do they
need to do that?

01:44.767 --> 01:45.967
- Because, research...

01:46.067 --> 01:49.367
- Do not say "research
has shown."

01:49.467 --> 01:52.667
- I wasn't gonna say
"research has shown."

01:52.767 --> 01:53.843
- Then what were you gonna say?

01:53.867 --> 01:55.933
- That...

01:56.067 --> 01:57.433
that "studies have indicated"...

01:57.533 --> 01:59.167
- Oh God.

02:00.667 --> 02:02.467
- Research has shown...

02:02.567 --> 02:04.167
when coworkers know
each other better,

02:04.267 --> 02:05.600
they work better together,

02:05.700 --> 02:08.400
and it reduces the number
of employee arguments,

02:08.500 --> 02:11.233
fistfights,
and office homicides.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.933
- That's so dumb.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.507
- Yeah, we've never
had an "off-site"

02:17.567 --> 02:18.943
and we know all we need
to know about each other.

02:18.967 --> 02:20.133
- Yeah, we do.

02:20.233 --> 02:22.700
- Hey there,
fellow Game Shakers!

02:22.800 --> 02:24.133
- Hey!
- Sup Huds.

02:24.233 --> 02:25.433
- Why do you look all happy?

02:25.533 --> 02:28.700
- 'Cuz I am all happy.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.880
- What-up with the new hat?

02:29.967 --> 02:33.133
- I got it for my birthday!

02:33.233 --> 02:34.600
- Wait, when was your birthday?

02:34.700 --> 02:36.433
- Yesterday!

02:36.533 --> 02:40.367
- Aww, buddy,
we're sorry we missed it.

02:40.467 --> 02:41.500
- We didn't know.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.467
- Aww man, we woulda
got ya somethin'.

02:43.567 --> 02:45.067
- Ah, it's cool.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.067
I got great stuff from
people who care about me!

02:51.200 --> 02:53.100
Like this awesome hat...

02:53.200 --> 02:56.133
and this fancy belt buckle

02:56.233 --> 03:00.500
that's connected to Pear TV...

03:00.600 --> 03:03.267
- Cock-a-doodle doo!
The cow says moo!

03:03.367 --> 03:05.800
Cock-a-doodle doo!
The cow says...

03:07.467 --> 03:09.700
- Ya see? None of us knew
when Hudson's birthday was.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.533
This is exactly why we
need to have an off-site,

03:12.633 --> 03:14.700
so we can all get to know
each other better.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.900
- Look, we don't wanna lock
ourselves in some room

03:17.067 --> 03:18.100
for a whole weekend.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.367
- It doesn't have
to be "a room."

03:20.467 --> 03:22.833
Some companies have
off-sites in Hawaii,

03:22.933 --> 03:27.067
or Vegas, or Fresno...

03:27.100 --> 03:28.900
- Hey, y'know where
I've always wanted to go?

03:29.067 --> 03:32.400
- Is it a place?

03:32.500 --> 03:33.633
- Where?

03:33.733 --> 03:36.767
- Yosemite,
it's a cool place in California

03:36.867 --> 03:39.367
where you can go camping,
like, on top of a mountain.

03:39.467 --> 03:43.367
- Ooo, I love
the tops of places!

03:43.467 --> 03:45.109
- And hey, I bet my dad
could take us there

03:45.133 --> 03:46.567
on his private jet!

03:46.667 --> 03:49.267
- Really, you think so?
- Really, we're all into this?

03:49.367 --> 03:51.247
We're gonna have a real
Game Shakers off-site?!?

03:51.333 --> 03:54.167
- Totally!
- Hex yeah!

03:54.267 --> 03:55.900
- And to celebrate,

03:56.067 --> 03:58.967
I say we watch some TV
on my belt buckle.

03:59.067 --> 04:03.233
- Es un nuevo día
en Fred Langosta...

04:03.333 --> 04:05.767
- Ah, it's a commercial.

04:12.267 --> 04:14.367
- Hi. Welcome, campers!

04:14.467 --> 04:15.833
Who's ready for
the Game Shakers'

04:15.933 --> 04:17.367
first annual off-site?

04:17.467 --> 04:19.133
I am!

04:23.733 --> 04:26.467
Now, when I say off
you say site... Off!

04:26.567 --> 04:29.967
- Nope. Not happening.
- We're not doin' that.

04:30.067 --> 04:33.067
- Oh fine, whatever.

04:33.167 --> 04:35.700
- And uh...
what's all this junk?

04:35.800 --> 04:37.067
- Camping supplies.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.833
So we'll be prepared
for anything.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.967
- Bear urine?

04:43.067 --> 04:46.067
- I'm not drinkin' that.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.367
- You don't drink it,

04:47.467 --> 04:49.333
we sprinkle it all
around our campsite,

04:49.433 --> 04:51.167
to keep other wild animals away.

04:51.267 --> 04:53.333
- Well, what about bears?

04:53.433 --> 04:55.867
- Huh?

04:55.967 --> 04:59.067
- Does bear urine
keep bears away?

04:59.133 --> 05:01.367
- Seems like a flaw
in your system.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.800
- What's up, guys?

05:06.900 --> 05:08.800
- Hey, Hudson.
- What's up?

05:08.900 --> 05:11.533
- Everyone, this is my
great grandmother, Gammy.

05:11.633 --> 05:13.733
Say hi Gammy.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.800
- HAAA!

05:15.900 --> 05:18.100
- Gammy...
- Hi...

05:18.200 --> 05:20.533
- And, uh, why did you
bring your Gammy here?

05:20.633 --> 05:24.600
- Cuz. It's her dream
to meet Channing Tatum.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.500
- CHANNING TATUM!

05:28.600 --> 05:31.400
- Okay...

05:31.500 --> 05:33.267
You need to send her home.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.333
- Why?
- 'Cuz there's bear urine here

05:36.433 --> 05:39.167
and it's no place
for the elderly.

05:39.267 --> 05:41.367
- Gotchu.

05:41.467 --> 05:45.067
Alright, sorry Gammy,
you can't come.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.800
- BYYYYEEEEE.

05:49.533 --> 05:51.867
- Wanna give her a little...
- Push...

05:51.967 --> 05:53.127
- Some help out.
- She's good.

05:53.167 --> 05:56.433
- There ya go!
Scoot along.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.067
- Hey hey hey!

06:00.100 --> 06:03.333
Who all's ready for Yo-semite?

06:05.300 --> 06:07.467
- It's pronounced Yosemite.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.967
- Oh, are ya sure it's
not pronounced "Yo a nerd?"

06:12.300 --> 06:13.933
- That was a good one dad!

06:14.067 --> 06:16.867
- No no no, don't laugh!
It only encourages him.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.433
- Ay Bunny, Ruthless!
Bring my stuff in here.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.433
- Okay Dub!
- Coming!

06:22.533 --> 06:25.067
- Whoa whoa...
- What's all this stuff?!?

06:25.100 --> 06:29.067
- Well that's all my luggage,
for the off-site trip.

06:29.133 --> 06:30.867
- Dad, you don't need
that much stuff

06:30.967 --> 06:32.109
for a three-day camping trip.

06:32.133 --> 06:33.700
- Maybe you don't.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.867
But I plan to maintain
the lifestyle

06:35.967 --> 06:38.600
to which I've grown accustomed.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.500
- Dude, our off-site
is a camping trip, okay?

06:40.600 --> 06:41.900
That means we rough it.

06:42.067 --> 06:44.300
- Yeah. Like when you
have to use the bathroom,

06:44.400 --> 06:47.267
you dig a hole with this.

06:47.367 --> 06:49.467
- You can dig a hole.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.733
I'm gonna use this.
Show 'em.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.900
Look at that.

07:04.067 --> 07:06.300
- What a commode!

07:08.200 --> 07:09.500
- How does it work?

07:09.600 --> 07:11.933
- Oh. See, you just
sit on this part...

07:12.067 --> 07:14.500
- No, no.
I think she means...

07:14.600 --> 07:18.200
when you flush,
where does the... "stuff" go?

07:18.300 --> 07:21.800
- Ohhh. I'll show ya!
Observe.

07:21.900 --> 07:25.267
I take the stuff,
drop it in here...

07:25.367 --> 07:27.767
- And then I flush thusly...

07:30.800 --> 07:35.067
- Hudson!
Your great-grandmother.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.700

someone else have the jet.

- Unbelievable.
- Come on, dad!

08:23.100 --> 08:26.367
- You ruined our off-site!

08:26.467 --> 08:29.167
- You had one thing to do...
One thing!

08:29.267 --> 08:32.267
- Have your private jet
ready to fly us to Yosemite.

08:32.367 --> 08:34.267
- Hey, don't sass me!

08:34.367 --> 08:36.333
If you're mad,
call Kim and Kanye,

08:36.433 --> 08:37.900
'cuz this is their fault!

08:38.067 --> 08:39.400
- No it's not!

08:39.500 --> 08:40.776
You're the one who said
they could borrow

08:40.800 --> 08:41.843
your private jet this weekend!

08:41.867 --> 08:43.600
- Well I had to let him use it!

08:43.700 --> 08:45.300
It's part of the celebrity code.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.867
- What celebrity code?

08:46.967 --> 08:49.300
- When one superstar
needs to borrow

08:49.400 --> 08:50.509
another superstar's private jet,

08:50.533 --> 08:53.767
you gotta let 'em borrow it!

08:53.867 --> 08:55.967
- But you said you'd never let
Kanye borrow it again

08:56.067 --> 09:00.567
'cuz last time he left it
on the runway without any gas!

09:00.667 --> 09:02.367
- Yeah!
They trashed it, too.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.133
Remember all those stains?

09:05.867 --> 09:08.500
- Look...
let's just go online

09:08.600 --> 09:10.043
and see if we can book
a flight to Yosemite.

09:10.067 --> 09:11.067
- On it.

09:11.167 --> 09:12.433
- Nope! No no no no no.

09:12.533 --> 09:13.400
I'm not doing it.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.867
- Why not?
- What?

09:14.967 --> 09:18.400
- 'Cuz I'm a major
celebrity, alright.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.500
I'm not gonna ride
on some public airplane

09:21.600 --> 09:24.233
with a bunch of regular people!

09:24.333 --> 09:26.067
- Okay, it doesn't even matter

09:26.100 --> 09:28.409
'cuz there are no more flights
from New York to Yosemite today.

09:28.433 --> 09:30.600
- Aw.
- Oh man!

09:30.700 --> 09:32.533
- Let's just all go home.

09:32.633 --> 09:34.109
- Yeah, I'm gonna lie down.
- Yeah, go home.

09:34.133 --> 09:35.233
- Come on guys!

09:35.333 --> 09:37.300
We can still have our off-site.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.500
- Have it where?

09:38.600 --> 09:40.567
- Here... at Game Shakers.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.800
- This is a work place.
- Sounds whack!

09:43.900 --> 09:45.867
- This place is so fun and big,

09:45.967 --> 09:48.400
and we can still do all the same
kinda off-site bonding stuff

09:48.500 --> 09:50.233
that we were gonna
do in Yosemite!

09:50.333 --> 09:53.300
- I really wanted to go camping!

09:53.400 --> 09:55.900
- Yeah, and I wanted to use
my special new portable toilet!

09:57.600 --> 10:00.133
- Okay, well, you know,
we can kinda camp here,

10:00.233 --> 10:03.900
and no one's sayin' you can't
use your new special toilet.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.600
- Yeah, just nobody
stand behind it.

10:09.267 --> 10:10.800
- So it's a deal?

10:10.900 --> 10:12.576
We'll have our Game Shakers
off-site here, this weekend?

10:12.600 --> 10:14.667
- Ah, yeah.
- Sure, whatever.

10:14.767 --> 10:18.233
- C'mon, you guys could murmur
with more enthusiasm than that!

10:18.333 --> 10:21.100
- Yeah!
- Ooh yeah!

10:29.500 --> 10:30.633
- Oh...

10:30.733 --> 10:33.233
Yeah, that is a nice tent.
Mmmmm!

10:33.333 --> 10:36.033
I'm gonna enjoy
sleepin' in there.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.400
- Hudson, let's go.
We're starting.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.900
- Hang on!
I'm making salsa!

10:46.333 --> 10:48.200
- You're making salsa?

10:48.300 --> 10:49.967
- Yeah. See...

10:50.067 --> 10:52.567
I got the tomatoes
and the onions right here...

10:52.667 --> 10:56.800
and I set a bowl on that stool
over there by the door.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.667
- And why...

10:59.767 --> 11:03.233
are you putting that stuff
in Dub's toilet?

11:03.333 --> 11:04.867
- Watch...

11:08.200 --> 11:10.200
- Oh!
- Whoah!

11:12.833 --> 11:14.700
- SALSA!

11:19.833 --> 11:20.833
- All right people...

11:20.867 --> 11:22.367
the goal of our weekend here

11:22.467 --> 11:23.743
is to get to know
each other better

11:23.767 --> 11:25.200
and become a stronger team.

11:25.300 --> 11:28.067
So, our first bonding
experience will be...

11:28.167 --> 11:31.200
- Please say hot yoga...
please say hot yoga...

11:35.333 --> 11:36.443
- Revealing Personal Secrets.

11:36.467 --> 11:37.933
- Dang it!

11:38.067 --> 11:40.967
- And, uh, how is
this supposed to work?

11:41.067 --> 11:42.600
- See, we just go
around the room,

11:42.700 --> 11:44.176
and everyone tells
a secret about themselves.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.633
- Or it can be like
a hidden talent that you have.

11:47.733 --> 11:50.833
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

11:50.933 --> 11:52.767
- Okay let's see, uh, Hudson,

11:52.867 --> 11:54.500
why don't you
get the ball rolling?

11:54.600 --> 11:57.900
- Yeah.
- Get up there, Hubbins.

11:58.067 --> 12:02.200
- I was born with only
five toes on each foot.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.100
- Hudson...

12:08.200 --> 12:09.233
- No, don't tell him,

12:09.333 --> 12:10.700
let's just move on.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.900
- Uh... Babe?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.767
- 'Kay.
- Yeah, go Babe.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.900
- I don't think I've ever
told any of you this, but...

12:21.067 --> 12:23.233
I can talk, sing, or scream...

12:23.333 --> 12:25.833
with my mouth completely closed.

12:25.933 --> 12:27.967
- No way!
- Oh come on.

12:28.067 --> 12:31.200
- Nobody can do that.
- Liar!

12:31.300 --> 12:32.700
- Okay okay, you wanna see?

12:32.800 --> 12:34.200
- Yep.

12:37.233 --> 12:40.100

12:50.533 --> 12:51.833
- DROP THAT!

12:51.933 --> 12:54.200
- 'CUZ I CAN'T GET
ENOUGH WHEN YOU...

12:54.300 --> 12:55.200
DROP THAT WHAT!

12:55.300 --> 12:58.200
- YOU BETTER PICK IT UP.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.733

13:04.833 --> 13:06.067
- All right, Trip,

13:06.133 --> 13:07.709

we don't know about you.

13:07.733 --> 13:10.700
- Okay, all right
uhhh... ah!

13:10.800 --> 13:13.267
When I was little my dad
taught me how to fish

13:13.367 --> 13:15.900
in a very unusual way.

13:16.067 --> 13:17.100
- How?
- I gotta know!

13:17.200 --> 13:18.440
- Tell us!
- Is it using a pole?

13:18.533 --> 13:19.633
- Nah, nah, hey.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.167
Don't tell 'em my fish trick!

13:21.267 --> 13:23.700
- Oh come on now,
we really wanna know.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.500
- Yeah, come on.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.943
- Alright, tell 'em
tell 'em tell 'em.

13:26.967 --> 13:29.600
- Okay. When I was
about six years old,

13:29.700 --> 13:31.967
and my dad took me
up to Lake Hondo.

13:32.067 --> 13:35.133
There I was,
standin' on the dock.

13:35.233 --> 13:37.433
It was a warm sunny day.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.133
- Hey!
Whatcha doin' there Trip?

13:39.233 --> 13:42.067
- I'm fishing.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.967
- With a pole?

13:45.067 --> 13:46.833
- Yeah.

13:46.933 --> 13:49.867
- Well, you want me to show you
my secret fishin' technique?

13:49.967 --> 13:52.833
- Okay!
- Heheheha!

13:52.933 --> 13:55.133
What's that?

13:55.233 --> 13:57.100
- This is a bang ball.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.267
Hey fish!

14:02.133 --> 14:06.200
Haha! Oh, whoah!
Oh, ow! Haha!

14:06.300 --> 14:09.200
Now this is how
rich people fish!

14:12.300 --> 14:14.933
- Oh, that was so much fun.
- Yeah.

14:15.067 --> 14:18.467
- Aw, bang balls.
Bang balls...

14:19.567 --> 14:21.767
- Okayyy...

14:21.867 --> 14:25.233
Ruthless, tell us somethin'
we don't know about you.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.667
- Okay!

14:27.767 --> 14:30.933
So... Until last year...

14:31.067 --> 14:34.767
I didn't know
that to make a pickle...

14:34.867 --> 14:37.067
you gotta start with a cucumber.

14:39.967 --> 14:43.567
- Where did you think
pickles came from?

14:43.667 --> 14:45.367
- Pickle trees!

14:48.533 --> 14:50.933
Bunny's scared of rabbits!

14:52.767 --> 14:54.767
- Kenz, your turn.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.667
- Oh. Well...

14:56.767 --> 14:58.733
- C'mon, tell us somethin' good.

14:58.833 --> 15:01.133
- Yeah, somethin' juicy.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.767
Lotta juice.

15:03.867 --> 15:05.967
- Okay. Back in third grade

15:06.067 --> 15:08.433
I made this really cool project
for the Junior Science Fair.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.300
I called it a Fruit Flinger.

15:12.767 --> 15:14.267
- Wait, a Fruit Flinger?

15:14.367 --> 15:17.333
- Yeah, you could put any piece
of fruit in the launch pod,

15:17.433 --> 15:19.073
and then it would
fling it across the room

15:19.100 --> 15:20.900
at like 90 miles an hour.

15:21.067 --> 15:25.433
- That's fast.
- Wow, 90 miles per hour...

15:25.533 --> 15:28.067
- And during lunch...
- Ooo!

15:28.100 --> 15:30.067
- Yes Bunny?
- Was it hot dog day?

15:32.333 --> 15:34.500
- Bunny will you let that girl
tell the story?!?

15:36.567 --> 15:39.067
- Anyway, some kids wanted me
to show 'em how it worked...

15:39.167 --> 15:40.933
So, I put a peach
in the launch pod,

15:41.067 --> 15:42.909
and it accidentally went off
and flung the peach

15:42.933 --> 15:44.433
across the room and hit a girl.

15:44.533 --> 15:46.633
- Whaaat!?
- Oh!

15:46.733 --> 15:47.809
- Well wait wait,
what girl did it hit?

15:47.833 --> 15:49.567
- I dunno, it was chaos...

15:49.667 --> 15:51.333
and then the cafeteria lady

15:51.433 --> 15:53.353
grabbed me and took me
to the principal's office.

15:54.367 --> 15:56.800
- So you never found out
who got whacked by your peach?

15:56.900 --> 15:58.800
- Unh-uh, I just know

15:58.900 --> 16:00.800
it slammed right into
some poor girl's face.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.233
- Man, I wonder
what she looks like.

16:03.333 --> 16:06.567
- Well, that poor girl's face...

16:06.667 --> 16:09.767
was ME!

16:09.867 --> 16:11.067
- Whaaaat?!?

16:11.133 --> 16:14.067
- Ha!
I gotta get this on video!

16:14.100 --> 16:19.067
- It took five doctors to pull
your peach outta my EYE!

16:19.133 --> 16:21.300
- Oh my God Babe I'm so sorry!!!

16:21.400 --> 16:23.533
- So was my eye!!!

16:23.633 --> 16:26.067
- Well come on Babe,
you can't be mad at me now

16:26.133 --> 16:28.043
after all these y...
- Yes! Yes I can be mad at you!

16:28.067 --> 16:30.067
- Talk trash about her mom!

16:32.433 --> 16:35.100
- You... you're
an attempted peach murderer!

16:35.200 --> 16:37.267
- That's not f...

16:37.367 --> 16:40.867
- No! Come on, Babe I...
- I'LL BE IN THE TENT!

16:46.133 --> 16:49.333
- Hey, that's my tent!

16:49.433 --> 16:52.233
Hey, it's cool,
you can hang in there.

16:56.767 --> 17:00.067
- You guys wanna

17:31.300 --> 17:32.733

17:32.833 --> 17:34.100
Babe is still in my tent!

17:34.200 --> 17:37.900
And I wanna go in there
and take a bubble bath!

17:38.067 --> 17:39.307
- Well we told her to come out.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.267
- She's still upset
about the peach.

17:41.367 --> 17:43.767
- Anybody want a cucumber?!?

17:43.867 --> 17:45.043
- Nooo, we don't!

17:49.567 --> 17:52.867
Babe! Come outta

17:52.967 --> 17:54.133

17:55.733 --> 17:57.967

17:58.067 --> 18:00.667
Ow! Ow!

18:06.067 --> 18:08.500
- I'm gonna let her stay in
there for a little while longer.

18:11.667 --> 18:12.667
- Kenzie's back.

18:12.767 --> 18:13.867
- Hey, where ya been?

18:13.967 --> 18:16.467
- At the little market
down the street.

18:18.167 --> 18:21.700
- Babe...
Babe...

18:21.800 --> 18:22.967
Is she still in there?

18:23.067 --> 18:24.367
- Yeah, she's in there.

18:24.467 --> 18:27.567
- I think the problem is
that she hates you now.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.700
- All right, look...
I know you're mad at me,

18:31.800 --> 18:33.500
so let me fix this, right now.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.067
- Fix it how?

18:35.100 --> 18:38.233
- Well...

18:38.333 --> 18:40.433
Since I hit you
in the face with a peach...

18:40.533 --> 18:42.700
I want you to come out here
and throw a peach at me.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.167
- Oooooo.

18:45.267 --> 18:47.700
- Gettin' good.

- Move the furniture!

19:06.567 --> 19:07.967

19:08.067 --> 19:10.267
The moment of revenge
is upon us!

19:10.367 --> 19:12.133
- Yeah!!
- Woo!

19:12.233 --> 19:15.133
- Kenzie, are you
ready for payback?

19:15.233 --> 19:17.133
- Yeah, just do it already.

19:17.233 --> 19:19.167
- Babe... are you ready

19:19.267 --> 19:21.067
to whip Kenzie in the face
with a hard peach?

19:21.167 --> 19:24.300
- I've been ready
since the third grade.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.100
- Oohh! Ooohhh!
- Yeah! Yeah!

19:27.200 --> 19:29.133
- Okay then.

19:29.233 --> 19:31.267
On your marks!

19:31.367 --> 19:34.467
- Wait! Babe! Wait!

19:34.567 --> 19:37.067
Before you throw
that peach at my face

19:37.100 --> 19:39.233
I just want you to know
that I love y...

19:39.333 --> 19:41.600

19:45.167 --> 19:47.467
- Babe brought some heat!

19:50.733 --> 19:52.400
- You missed.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.500
- I missed you on purpose.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.667
- Oh... but why?

20:00.067 --> 20:03.233
- Cuz, back in third grade,

20:03.333 --> 20:08.033
you didn't mean to impale
my eye with a peach...

20:08.133 --> 20:09.267
Right?

20:09.367 --> 20:11.733
- Oh no! God no. Not at all!

20:11.833 --> 20:15.433
- Okay...
Then we're cool.

20:16.733 --> 20:19.000
- Really...?

20:19.100 --> 20:21.467
- Yes!

20:21.567 --> 20:23.300
Alright, come on.
You know you want this.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.900
- Hey! That's cute!

20:29.000 --> 20:30.800
- So... now what?

20:30.900 --> 20:32.900
- Now...

20:33.000 --> 20:35.400
Fruit fight!!!

20:36.733 --> 20:39.000
- Guys! Stop throwing
the peaches!

20:39.100 --> 20:41.600
Put the peaches away!

20:41.700 --> 20:44.133
Come on, guys!
Hey!

20:44.233 --> 20:47.133
Guys! Put the peaches away!

20:47.233 --> 20:49.600
- Hey Bunny!!!

20:49.700 --> 20:50.900
- Look out Bunny!

21:00.367 --> 21:04.300
- Kenzie!
- You all right, Kenzie?

21:08.633 --> 21:11.067
- Hey Kenz...
does this hurt?

21:11.100 --> 21:13.133
- Ahhhhhhhhh!!!

21:13.233 --> 21:15.900
- Please don't do that.

21:16.067 --> 21:19.567
- So... how is she?

21:19.667 --> 21:22.067
- Well, this girl has
a peach wedged in her eye.

21:22.100 --> 21:24.433
That's not good.
Let's take her.

21:27.300 --> 21:28.509
- Well, see you soon Kenz.
- We love you Kenzie!

21:28.533 --> 21:30.013
- Take care of your eye!
- Later Kenz.

21:32.300 --> 21:33.733
- Oh, uh...

21:33.833 --> 21:35.243
do any of you wanna
come to the hospital,

21:35.267 --> 21:36.667
to be with Kenzie?

21:36.767 --> 21:39.267
