WEBVTT

02:49.212 --> 02:51.562
I really think
you're gonna like this one.

02:51.606 --> 02:54.304
It's a lot different than
the other properties we've seen.

02:54.348 --> 02:58.003
What I'm about to show
is pretty special.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.881
Don't you get your boat craving
satisfied at work every day?

03:05.924 --> 03:08.971
You know, you'd think I would,
but, uh, it's a tease.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.973
It's everyone else's boat
I'm dealing with.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.975
Peter owns a marina
down the street.

03:13.018 --> 03:16.196
Oh, cool. This way.
After you.

03:19.068 --> 03:22.289
Peter, Amanda,
welcome to Penthouse One.

03:33.213 --> 03:37.434
Wow, this viewgives a whole new perspective on
the island.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.480
Gosh, it's gorgeous.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.832
Indisputably,
the best view of the island.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.616
Not only do you get the ocean,

03:45.660 --> 03:48.228
you get the boats,
you get the town, all of it.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.839
When they built the Sky House,

03:50.882 --> 03:54.364
they angled it to maximize
the view of the sunrise.

03:54.408 --> 03:57.149
It's amazing from every floor.

03:57.193 --> 03:59.195
But nothing like from the top.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.938
And, well, what you see
is what you get.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.374
What do you mean?

04:04.418 --> 04:07.508
The condo comes completely
furnished as is.

04:07.551 --> 04:10.511
What, the antiques
and the artwork?

04:10.554 --> 04:13.775
It's not uncommon
for a beach condo
to be sold furnished.

04:13.818 --> 04:17.431
It doesn't usually come with
antiques and art.

04:17.474 --> 04:20.695
Well, I've always wanted
my own suit of armor.

04:20.738 --> 04:24.133
Well, Sir Peter,
make sure you don't
cut yourself with the sword.

04:24.176 --> 04:26.701
Oh, thank you, dear.

04:33.229 --> 04:36.188
The owners were
a bit eclectic.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.321
One was the heir
to a tobacco fortune,

04:38.365 --> 04:41.106
the other, a museum curator,
from what I understand.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.195
This is all
just excess to them.

04:43.239 --> 04:44.632
They didn't want to
have to move it,

04:44.675 --> 04:46.634
and they thought it
would expedite a sale.

04:46.677 --> 04:49.854
See that big marble vase
over there?

04:49.898 --> 04:51.334
That belonged
to Bernie Madoff

04:51.378 --> 04:53.641
when the feds sold off
all of his possessions.

04:53.684 --> 04:56.948
It came from an estate auction
in Palm Beach.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.342
They needed a crane
to get it up here.

04:59.386 --> 05:03.433
Wow, see, babe?
We can actually own something

05:03.477 --> 05:06.741
that was once owned
by the world's biggest
Ponzi schemer.

05:06.784 --> 05:10.614
That's not really
a selling point.

05:10.658 --> 05:14.270
Uh, can you give us
a minute?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.663
Uh, sure, sure.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.583
I love it. I mean,
it's absolutely perfect,

05:22.626 --> 05:24.933
and we don't have to worry
about nosy neighbors.

05:24.976 --> 05:27.588
I mean, I guess
the boaters are our neighbors.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.070
Yeah, but Amanda,we don't even know
how much this place costs,

05:32.114 --> 05:35.073
and we lose 100 square feet
of living space.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.685
Yeah, but look
at what we gain.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.645
Hey, Mike,
what's the asking price?

05:41.689 --> 05:44.692
Completely furnished?
579,000.

05:44.735 --> 05:48.217
Whew! Amanda,that's a lot of money.
We can't afford that.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.697
Well, let's talk about it.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.002
You know, we can
list the lake condo

05:51.046 --> 05:52.700
as a vacation property.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.092
I mean, that's positive income.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.138
Both our businesses
are doing well.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.836
We have at least
a 30% down payment.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.143
I really think
we can swing this.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.232
Peter, this is what
we've always wanted.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.017
It is pretty amazing.

06:07.584 --> 06:10.457
Well--
So, movin' on up?

06:10.500 --> 06:12.633
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky.

06:13.851 --> 06:17.115
Hey, Mike, we'll take it.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.918
Hey, how often do the boats
get changed out?

06:36.961 --> 06:40.182
Ah, it depends.
Some stay a night,
some stay a week.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.010
They're not supposed to stay
much longer than that.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.794
That boat was here
when we first started

06:43.838 --> 06:45.622
looking at the place,
wasn't it?

06:46.623 --> 06:47.668
Huh.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.626
That's good memory.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.455
How do you remember that?
It was over a week ago.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.849
Why do you remember
that particular boat?

06:54.892 --> 06:57.199
Well, I was walking
Humphrey the other day,

06:57.242 --> 06:59.288
and I caught a glimpse
of this woman on the boat.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.464
I waved to her,
I don't think she saw me.

07:01.508 --> 07:05.555
But she was with some guy,
maybe her husband?

07:05.599 --> 07:08.428
Well, whoever they were,
they're fighting now.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.778
- Typical married couple.
- Hey.

07:12.519 --> 07:16.740
So, what do you thinkabout changing out
some of this stuff?

07:17.741 --> 07:19.656
Like what?

07:19.700 --> 07:26.054
Oh, I don't know,
maybe some of the artwork,

07:26.097 --> 07:29.318
pieces of furniture,
and this thing?

07:30.319 --> 07:32.147
The African mask?

07:32.190 --> 07:35.150
I mean, come on,
who doesn't love
the African mask?

07:35.193 --> 07:37.761
That is just a little creepy.

07:37.805 --> 07:38.849
Okay.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.287
Well, let's just get out
from under all this stuff,

07:42.331 --> 07:46.509
and in a couple of weeks
we'll make this more
Peter and Amanda.

07:46.553 --> 07:47.815
Sounds great.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.216
Well, have a good day, babe.
I'll call you at lunch.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.262
I have even a better idea.

08:00.305 --> 08:01.611
After you get all
this unpacking done,

08:01.655 --> 08:03.439
why don't you
just take me to lunch?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.573
- That is an exceptional idea.
- I know, right?

08:06.616 --> 08:10.707
- Okay, I love you.
- Hey, I love you more.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.492
See you later.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.624
Hungry, buddy?

08:42.260 --> 08:45.916
Oh, Charles,don't forget the beer.

08:47.614 --> 08:50.051
When have I
forgotten the beer?

08:50.094 --> 08:52.444
Make sure you're back here
at five o'clock, huh?

08:58.450 --> 09:00.931
There's another check here,
somewhere.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.109
Where is it?

09:05.153 --> 09:07.503
I can't--
Just-just let me.
-

09:09.418 --> 09:11.899
CB Marina, this is Peter.
Can I help you?

09:11.942 --> 09:13.727
You need
a better system, Peter.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.598
The system works for me.

09:16.643 --> 09:17.905
Yes, sir.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.823
- Thank you, Kate.
- Mm.

09:22.866 --> 09:25.608
Yeah, we can get
your boat in the water
this afternoon, certainly.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.436
What do I wear?

09:29.656 --> 09:31.527
This is so old.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.097
I wore this in high school.

10:18.879 --> 10:21.316
Tony, how many times
have I told you

10:21.359 --> 10:23.187
to make sure that you
picked up the trash

10:23.231 --> 10:25.059
before you open the store?

10:25.102 --> 10:28.062
I'm sorry, Ms. Wright.I was ten minutes late
opening this morning,

10:28.105 --> 10:29.672
and I was just,like, in a hurry
to get the store ready.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.153
Um, did you
just admit to your boss

10:32.196 --> 10:34.982
that you were late for work?
Again, I might add?

10:35.025 --> 10:37.506
Oh, yeah, not a smart move
on my part.

10:37.549 --> 10:40.161
No. But you know what?
You've been with me
the longest,

10:40.204 --> 10:42.163
you helped me
open the store, so...

10:42.206 --> 10:43.425
You're not gonna
fire me, are you?

10:43.468 --> 10:45.688
Not today,
as long as you go out

10:45.732 --> 10:47.168
and pick up the trash
and clean the window.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.997
Right away, Ms. Wright,
I'll get on that right now.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.563
Okay, thank you, Tony.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.970
Hi, welcome to the CB Surf Shop.

11:09.059 --> 11:12.410
We just got a shipment
of the cutest little sundresses.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.804
Let me know if I can help you
with anything, okay?

11:16.371 --> 11:17.894
Can I try this one?

11:18.895 --> 11:20.418
Of course.

11:20.462 --> 11:23.857
And, actually,
I think you have to try this.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.163
This would look
fabulous on you.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.338
Bring in a few,
you never know.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.600
You might go home
with all of them.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.734
Okay, I'll try it.

11:31.778 --> 11:32.996
Let me bring
you to the fitting room.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.046
Thank you.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.221
All right,
let me know if you need

11:40.264 --> 11:41.570
another size
or color, okay?

11:41.613 --> 11:43.354
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

11:48.272 --> 11:51.623
Hey, does she look
familiar to you at all?

11:53.234 --> 11:55.932
Uh, no, ma'am.
I don't think so.

11:55.976 --> 11:59.022
She looks familiar,
I just-- I can't place it.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.590
Well, we get
a lot of people in here.

12:01.633 --> 12:04.724
Yeah, but I usually know
all my customers by now.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.726
- Yeah.
- I know.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.034
I really like these two.

12:11.078 --> 12:14.037
Oh, that's great.
These are great choices.

12:14.081 --> 12:17.562
And I know the red
had to look amazing on you.

12:17.606 --> 12:20.217
- Shall we wrap it up?
- Sure, why not?

12:20.261 --> 12:24.047
So I have to ask,
you just look so familiar to me.

12:24.091 --> 12:27.834
- Have we ever met before?
- I don't think so.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.966
Yeah, I just--
Maybe in the shop?

12:30.010 --> 12:31.968
Have you ever been
here before?

12:32.012 --> 12:34.275
No, I really
don't get out much.

12:34.318 --> 12:37.365
Do you live on the island,
or you're just visiting?

12:37.408 --> 12:41.151
- We kind of live here.
- Kind of?

12:41.195 --> 12:43.197
We live on a sailboat
in the waterway.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.809
Oh! Oh, that's where
I've seen you.

12:46.853 --> 12:50.770
I can see your boatfrom our apartment
up on the balcony.

12:50.813 --> 12:54.599
Uh, we live in frontof the mooring field,
the big white building?

12:54.643 --> 12:56.819
That's what it is.
Oh, gosh, it was just--

12:56.863 --> 12:59.169
It was killing me,I couldn't--
I couldn't place you.

12:59.213 --> 13:02.651
Oh. We've only been there
like two months.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.609
Same with us.

13:04.653 --> 13:07.090
You know what? You should
come over one night.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.745
We'll have a glass of wine,
just have some girl time.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.443
You can see your boat
from a whole different
perspective.

13:12.487 --> 13:15.055
- Um, I don't know.
- Yeah.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.884
- Maybe sometime.
- Yeah, how about tonight?

13:17.927 --> 13:21.235
My husband works late.
It'll be fun,
it's gonna be a pretty night.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.366
It's a great idea.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.153
I don't know, I mean...

13:26.196 --> 13:29.069
Charles doesn't really like it
when I go out alone.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.332
Well, let me tell you something,when Charles sees you
in those dresses,

13:31.375 --> 13:33.247
you'll have him wrapped around
your finger, trust me.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.858
Here, I'm gonnagive you my address.
I'm not taking no for an answer.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.555
And here's my number.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.299
- I'll see. Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.276
Hey there, neighbor.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.452
I'm Charles,
I'm with the Beach Billy's.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.280
We've been in the neighborhood
trying to help people

14:06.323 --> 14:08.282
get back on their feet
after the big storm.

14:08.325 --> 14:11.154
I notice you could use
some work on your house.

14:11.198 --> 14:15.419
I'm wondering if anybody'sbeen by to give you an estimate
on getting that fixed yet?

14:15.463 --> 14:19.162
I've had three
carpetbaggers come by.

14:19.206 --> 14:22.557
They're overpriced,
typical after a storm.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.037
Typical, yeah.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.255
I'll tell you what,

14:25.299 --> 14:27.127
you quote me
on their lowest estimate,

14:27.170 --> 14:29.738
and we'll beat it by 40%.

14:29.781 --> 14:33.176
Well, I'm kinda busy
right now.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.483
Okay,
I'll tell you what.

14:35.526 --> 14:38.355
We'll get all this work
done for $2,000.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.836
You give us 50% down,
and the rest on completion,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.230
and we'll get it done
this week.

14:43.273 --> 14:46.886
You'll be finished this week?
You'd get here that quick?

14:46.929 --> 14:49.105
- Nobody else can.
- Guaranteed.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.587
Looks like
we've got a deal.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.679
Deal. let me get
my checkbook.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.572
Now, that's the way
you do it.

15:21.616 --> 15:24.053
- We're talkin' easy money.
- So when are we gonna start?

15:25.359 --> 15:28.405
Now listen, son,
I said easy money.

15:28.449 --> 15:34.194
Wait, you meanwe're not gonna do the work
that you just got paid for?

15:34.237 --> 15:36.674
Now you're learnin'.
Easy money.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.546
Look, man,

15:38.589 --> 15:41.679
I'm not trying to go to jail
over a couple of bucks.

15:41.723 --> 15:44.944
Only the owner goes to jail.
You can just take it easy, son.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.077
Whatever
you say, boss.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.557
Attaboy.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.613
Hey, Jerry.
- Morning, boss.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.139
That guy come back
about the Bayliner yet?

16:06.182 --> 16:07.575
Yes, he just left.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.011
He's coming back
with a deposit check,

16:09.055 --> 16:10.491
and wants it in the water
by the weekend.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.623
Awesome.
It's a great boat.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.929
It just needed
the right owner.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.887
- Yeah.
- Well, good work, Jerry.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.846
Keep it up,
and you'll make your month.

16:17.889 --> 16:20.849
- The month's not over yet.
- And I love the attitude.

16:24.853 --> 16:27.421
Hey, did you take care
of that DUI?

16:29.075 --> 16:31.555
I kinda missed
my first court appearance.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.731
You dumb fuck.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.820
That means there's a warrant
out for your arrest.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.213
They could pick you up
at any time.

16:37.257 --> 16:39.041
Look, give me a break.
I-I overslept,

16:39.085 --> 16:40.608
I didn't want to go
into court late.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.218
So you don't
show up at all?

16:43.654 --> 16:46.135
Good God!
When they come for you,

16:46.179 --> 16:48.485
and they will, it better not
be on the work site.

16:48.529 --> 16:51.445
I don't need
any more heat on me.
You take care of that DUI.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.187
I don't want the cops
around the job site
asking any questions.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.276
Okay, I'll get it taken care of.

16:56.319 --> 16:59.018
No, you take care
of it right now.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.827
Hey, girl.

17:25.870 --> 17:28.438
Hey!
I didn't hear you knock.

17:28.482 --> 17:31.224
Well, no wonder with all that
going on down there.

17:31.267 --> 17:34.053
- Gosh--
- Surprised you heard anything.

17:34.096 --> 17:37.969
Is that the girl that'ssupposed to come up here
for girls' night?

17:38.013 --> 17:41.060
That was the girl
I was hoping would come
for our happy hour.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.453
- Hmm.
- But it looks like
girls' night is out for her.

17:43.497 --> 17:46.152
Yeah, I think she's
a little bit occupied.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.415
But that just means
more wine for us, right?

17:48.458 --> 17:50.895
- That's right.
-  Cheers.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.810
I never get tired
of this view.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.911
I brought some wine.
Surprise!

18:06.955 --> 18:10.132
But it looks like, uh,
you got a head start on me.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.786
Mm.

18:11.829 --> 18:14.919
So what's the deal
with all the glasses?

18:14.963 --> 18:19.185
Well, Julie came over tonight,
and we were expecting Tess,

18:19.228 --> 18:21.274
but she was a no-show.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.319
Tess?

18:23.363 --> 18:25.626
Yes, the girl
from the sailboat.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.497
Ah, sailboat girl.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.369
Yes, her name is Tess,

18:29.412 --> 18:31.197
and she came into
the store today,

18:31.240 --> 18:32.763
and she's a very,
very lovely person.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.505
That's random.
What's she like?

18:35.549 --> 18:40.597
Mm. She's cute
and sweet and super shy,

18:40.641 --> 18:43.905
and I think she'll be great
once she just comes out
of her shell.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.560
So why didn't she
show up?

18:46.603 --> 18:50.738
Apparently, Charles is a very,
very controlling man.

18:50.781 --> 18:53.349
- Sailboat guy.
- Mm-hmm.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.830
A-ha. Control freak, huh?

18:55.873 --> 18:57.962
Well, if I lived
with someone like that,

18:58.006 --> 18:59.660
I wouldn't want to be
around them anyway.

18:59.703 --> 19:02.402
She seems
so scared of him.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.012
Can you blame her?

19:04.055 --> 19:05.796
We watch them
from 11 flights up,

19:05.840 --> 19:08.582
and you can see
what a mess it is.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.975
Yeah, I know,
but I just wanted her
to have a girls' night out,

19:11.019 --> 19:13.413
and fun, and just forget
her life for a little bit, you
know?

19:13.456 --> 19:15.197
Yeah.

19:15.241 --> 19:18.069
Well, maybe next time.

19:19.375 --> 19:22.683
Oh, gosh,
they're at it again.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.250
Why do people like that

19:24.293 --> 19:26.817
even bother
staying together?

19:26.861 --> 19:28.210
I don't know,
but they sounded like

19:28.254 --> 19:29.864
they were having
a good time earlier.

19:29.907 --> 19:32.736
Hm, changes
like the wind.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.697
Where the hell
did these dresses come from?

19:36.740 --> 19:38.394
I bought them.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.831
You bought 'em?
What, you're wasting
my money on clothes?

19:40.875 --> 19:42.355
What, are you
a fashion model now?

19:42.398 --> 19:45.401
You don't let me work,
so I don't have my own money.

19:45.445 --> 19:46.837
What do you want me to do?

19:48.622 --> 19:51.233
I told you, I don't want you
leaving the boat by yourself.

19:51.277 --> 19:54.193
What am I supposed to do?
I get bored.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.934
I'm locked on this boat
all day alone.

19:56.978 --> 19:58.632
I just needed to get out.

19:58.675 --> 20:02.157
Oh, you had to get out?
What, to go see someone?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.289
Who were you going to see?

20:03.332 --> 20:06.596
No, there's nobody
I go see!

20:06.640 --> 20:08.381
I just need to
get out sometimes--

20:08.424 --> 20:10.774
walk around, shop,
see other people.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.559
I don't want you
leaving the boat,

20:12.602 --> 20:15.518
not by yourself,
it's not safe.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.303
Do you understand?

20:17.346 --> 20:18.956
Do you hear me?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.611
Yeah, I understand.

20:21.655 --> 20:24.527
I just wanted to surprise you
with something nice.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.488
I tell you what,
keep the red one.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.317
You look good in red.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.104
Come here.
Come here.

20:40.674 --> 20:41.631
Okay?

20:43.546 --> 20:44.721
All right?

20:45.983 --> 20:47.202
Tell you what...

20:49.117 --> 20:51.641
Go put on the red dress,
and I'll be right down.

20:52.642 --> 20:53.817
- Okay.
- Okay?

21:09.529 --> 21:12.880
Do you really have to leaveyour loving husband today
and go to work?

21:12.923 --> 21:14.577
You know it's the last thing
I want to do,

21:14.621 --> 21:16.884
but the Chamber of Commerce
is hosting this mixer,

21:16.927 --> 21:18.581
and, you know,
I said I'd be there.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.105
- Tony can't handle
the preparations.
- Mm.

21:21.149 --> 21:25.240
But, you know,
I think it'll be a good way
to bring in some new faces.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.199
Well, maybe you can do
a one-night sale or something.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.550
That's a good idea.

21:30.593 --> 21:33.335
You know, I forgot
we had these boards.

21:33.379 --> 21:36.512
Well, we picked a great day
for it, perfect.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.906
The water's as smooth as glass,
and I have a feeling

21:38.949 --> 21:40.908
my abs are gonna feel it
in the morning.

21:40.951 --> 21:44.738
- Yeah, what abs?
- Oh, you're a funny girl.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.957
- Yeah.

21:48.611 --> 21:50.439
You got it?

21:50.483 --> 21:52.311
Oh, yeah,
I remember how to do this.

21:53.486 --> 21:54.791
Oh, yeah? Let's see.

22:00.057 --> 22:03.365
- Uh-huh. Wise guy.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.723
All right, let's see
how you work those abs.

22:22.123 --> 22:23.211
No coffee for me?

22:23.254 --> 22:25.822
Yeah, I'll get it.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.580
Oh, you stupid bitch.

22:44.624 --> 22:45.973
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

22:46.016 --> 22:48.149
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

22:48.192 --> 22:51.326
- I'll bet you
did that on purpose!

22:52.893 --> 22:57.027
No, I didn't,
it was an accident.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.987
Well,
get a towel, clean it up.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.468
- What's the matter with you?
- Okay, okay.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.166
God almighty.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.257
Don't be mad at me.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.999
Why do you do this?
Why do you do this?

23:13.653 --> 23:15.132
- I'm sorry.
- Tess--

23:15.176 --> 23:16.525
Why do you gotta
get me so mad?

23:17.526 --> 23:18.788
I don't.

23:20.964 --> 23:25.882
Tess, you know I love you.
You know that.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.318
And you always say
I'm the best thing

23:27.362 --> 23:28.798
that ever happened
to you, right?

23:30.191 --> 23:33.629
- Right? Don't you say that?
- Yeah...

23:35.675 --> 23:40.157
Okay, come on, finish up,
and get yourself a coffee.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.727
- We'll start all over again.
- Okay.

24:13.713 --> 24:14.931
Hey, Tony.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.585
Mr. Wright,
what's tight with you, man?

24:16.629 --> 24:17.804
What's tight with me?

24:17.847 --> 24:20.589
I... apparently need
a language update.

24:20.633 --> 24:23.200
- Ah.
- So where's the proprietor

24:23.244 --> 24:25.551
of this fine establishment?

24:25.594 --> 24:27.161
Uh...

24:36.083 --> 24:38.607
Hey. How are you?

24:38.651 --> 24:40.130
I'm good.
How's your day going?

24:40.174 --> 24:42.524
It's great. So where are
you takin' me to lunch?

24:42.568 --> 24:44.439
Well, I thought we'd have
a picnic in the park.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.136
That sounds great.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.921
- Hey, Tony.
- Yeah?

24:47.964 --> 24:49.662
I'm heading out
for about an hour, okay?

24:49.705 --> 24:52.316
- Okay.
- Please keep
unpacking the shipment.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.754
- You got it, boss.
- All right, thank you.

25:11.597 --> 25:15.905
Well, I'm glad that wefinally had some time
to make for lunch,

25:15.949 --> 25:17.820
since all that unpacking
you've been doing.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.082
Yeah, I know.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.824
Look across the street.

25:21.868 --> 25:24.000
That's our old place.

25:24.044 --> 25:25.741
I miss living there.

25:25.785 --> 25:28.570
Yeah, but you likeour new place better,
don't you?

25:28.614 --> 25:30.093
Oh, yeah,
of course.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.921
Well, good,
because I listed it,

25:31.965 --> 25:33.967
and we have
some inquiries,

25:34.010 --> 25:38.145
and our realtortold me that can get
$1,500 a week for it.

25:38.188 --> 25:39.886
Fifteen hundred a week?

25:39.929 --> 25:41.452
- Yep.
- Wow.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.063
So now all
we have to think about

25:43.106 --> 25:44.499
is whether we want to
manage it ourself

25:44.543 --> 25:46.240
or get a company to do it.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.590
Well, you've got the business,
I've got a business.

25:48.634 --> 25:49.939
Quite frankly,
I don't want to be

25:49.983 --> 25:52.202
changing people's sheets
and towels every day.

25:54.204 --> 25:55.423
You have a point.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.686
I'm gonna take that.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.383
- There you go.
-

25:59.427 --> 26:01.081
What's that? Yum.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.651
Yes. Yes, sir.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.218
I understand.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.742
Yeah, I know,
I gave you my word,

26:09.785 --> 26:12.005
and I stand by my word.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.703
Well, you see,

26:14.747 --> 26:18.011
we can't start work
until we get 50% up front.

26:18.054 --> 26:19.621
It's the way it works.

26:20.753 --> 26:23.930
Oh. Okay, I understand.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.585
I understand.
Screw you too, buddy.

26:29.022 --> 26:31.285
We lost that job.

26:31.328 --> 26:34.157
That guy might've
caught on to us, actually.

26:37.291 --> 26:40.076
Maybe we should
do this the right way.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.602
I mean, I-I needto make money, too.
I've got bills to pay.

26:43.645 --> 26:46.648
No, this is a great scam.
I've been working it for years,

26:46.692 --> 26:49.608
all up and down
the inter-coastal waterway.
It works.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.261
We lost a job,
we'll get another one.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.263
Shit happens, man,
that's the way it is with this.

26:53.307 --> 26:55.222
And what about last week?

26:55.265 --> 26:57.093
'Cause I still haven't been
paid for that.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.400
You'll get paid
when you get paid.

27:00.401 --> 27:03.273
Look, man,
all I'm saying is,

27:03.317 --> 27:05.101
I'm not gonna
be around forever.

27:05.145 --> 27:08.235
Okay? Eventually,
I'm gonna just roll.

27:08.278 --> 27:11.238
Don't you even
think about leaving.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.761
You short on money?

27:12.805 --> 27:15.242
Cash in one of your
diamond earrings, kid.

27:15.285 --> 27:17.853
- Get back in the van.

27:17.897 --> 27:20.900
- Get back in the van!

27:24.425 --> 27:26.601
Look what I got,
Humphrey.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.910
When did we get a telescope?

27:30.953 --> 27:33.956
I bought it used
on the Internet, $15.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.393
It's gonna be great
to look at the night sky.

27:36.437 --> 27:39.658
Well, it's neither night
or the sky you're looking at.

27:39.701 --> 27:42.791
I haven't seen
the neighbors yet today.

27:42.835 --> 27:44.924
Romeo and Juliet
are on the boat,

27:44.967 --> 27:48.014
their dinghy's still there,
but haven't caught them.

27:48.057 --> 27:51.365
Well, don't you think
maybe you're just
minding their business

27:51.408 --> 27:53.672
- a little too much?
- You kidding?

27:53.715 --> 27:56.457
It's great
being a nosy neighbor.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.112
You see all this stuff,
and you can't replicate

27:59.155 --> 28:01.723
the stuff you see on that boat
on any television show.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.727
Well, once you get
your television show fix,

28:05.771 --> 28:07.555
I think it's time
to head to work.

28:07.598 --> 28:11.167
I just have
to walk our friend,
and go for my run.

28:18.348 --> 28:20.611
The parts for the Grady
came in this morning.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.918
Terrific, let's get
'em installed ASAP,

28:22.962 --> 28:26.313
and, uh, get up with that guywho was interested in the boat
last week.

28:27.967 --> 28:30.360
So, uh,
how's the new place?

28:30.404 --> 28:31.840
Man, we love it.

28:31.884 --> 28:34.930
It's like we're actually
on top of the marina.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.715
You can see it perfectly,
like we're right there.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.326
Oh, great,
now we got the boss

28:39.369 --> 28:41.284
peering down
from his ivory tower.

28:41.328 --> 28:42.677
Oh, it's not like that,

28:42.721 --> 28:44.374
it's just we
love watching the boats

28:44.418 --> 28:46.072
come and go
in the mooring field.

28:46.115 --> 28:50.946
And the sunrise, the sunset,
it's amazing, it's therapeutic.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.687
It's gotta be nice,

28:52.731 --> 28:55.908
all kinds of interesting boats
and people like that.

28:55.951 --> 28:58.780
I tell you,
the islanders here
come from all walks of life.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.261
You know, it's funny
you should say that.

29:01.304 --> 29:05.482
There's this one sailboat
that's been there
since before we moved in.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.441
There's a couple
living on board and--

29:07.484 --> 29:10.966
I don't know,
there's something about 'em,
something odd.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.663
Have you met 'em?

29:12.707 --> 29:15.144
No, we just watch them
from the penthouse.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.407
Nothin' creepy about that.

29:17.451 --> 29:19.148
That's not what I mean.
It's nothing different

29:19.192 --> 29:21.977
than you getting to know
the routine of
your-your neighbors,

29:22.021 --> 29:23.892
seeing them come and go.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.981
Anyway, I've got
some invoices to do.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.766
Let me know about that guy
and that Grady.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.202
- Will do.
- Thanks.

29:34.294 --> 29:36.035
Oh, hey.

29:36.078 --> 29:37.688
I was wondering if you were
gonna pop back in here again.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.212
Hi.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.692
Hey, I'm sorry
you couldn't make it
the other night.

29:41.736 --> 29:45.087
Oh, I'm sorry,
I just couldn't.

29:45.131 --> 29:47.176
Hey, are you okay?

29:47.220 --> 29:49.831
Uh, yeah, of course.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.441
What happened
to your face?

29:52.442 --> 29:53.835
It's nothing.

29:53.879 --> 29:56.533
I just hit my face
on a cabinet on the boat.

29:56.577 --> 29:59.754
Small spaces
lead to busted faces.

30:01.538 --> 30:04.019
You know, I know
you don't know me
and everything,

30:04.063 --> 30:07.806
but, um, did somebody
do this to you?

30:10.634 --> 30:13.681
Look, um,
my sister went through
a similar situation,

30:13.724 --> 30:16.423
and, um, she found
a fantastic group

30:16.466 --> 30:18.729
that helped her get through
a really rough time.

30:18.773 --> 30:23.256
I'd be happy to share
with you that information,
if you want it.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.521
Really,
I'm completely fine.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.436
It's not
what you think at all.

30:29.479 --> 30:32.526
Okay.
Okay, um...

30:34.093 --> 30:36.356
You know what? I was ready
to break for lunch,

30:36.399 --> 30:38.053
and I would love
some company.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.403
I get these
tremendous sandwiches

30:40.447 --> 30:43.015
that I can never finish myself,
so my treat.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.496
I can't,
I really need to get going.

30:46.540 --> 30:47.933
- Thank you.
- Um, you know what?

30:47.976 --> 30:49.891
I'm not gonna take
no for an answer twice,

30:49.935 --> 30:53.895
so just let's go out.
We'll just sit for a while.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.941
I won't take
too much of your time.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.768
- Well, maybe.
- Okay.

30:57.812 --> 31:00.119
- Just for a bit, though.
- Okay, that's it, perfect.

31:00.162 --> 31:04.340
So, I met Charles in Florida
while I was bartending.

31:04.384 --> 31:06.821
It was just a small pub
in Tampa.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.606
He was in towndoing restoration work
after a hurricane.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.565
He was nice.

31:12.696 --> 31:16.309
There was just
something about him.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.485
- It's hard to explain,
you know.
- Mm.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.401
He had this strength.

31:22.576 --> 31:25.884
But... I just
could not resist him.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.059
You know?

31:27.102 --> 31:28.799
He swept me off my feet.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.585
What made you
move to Carolina Beach?

31:31.628 --> 31:33.413
Storm-chasing.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.023
Well, that'swhat he calls it
anyway.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.677
He would just
follow the storms,

31:36.720 --> 31:39.941
and settle in wherever towns
needed help rebuilding.

31:39.985 --> 31:42.465
Every single time we'd try
to plant roots somewhere,

31:42.509 --> 31:44.598
something would
always happen with his job,

31:44.641 --> 31:47.122
and we just
had to keep movin' on.

31:47.166 --> 31:51.518
Honestly? I never
wanted to leave Florida.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.302
All my family
and friends are there.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.655
So something always came up,
like what?

31:58.699 --> 32:00.962
Oh, God, just--
it's always something.

32:01.006 --> 32:03.269
There's a problemwith the boat slip,
or the mooring ball.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.402
I don't know,
the job would go bad,

32:06.446 --> 32:08.143
and we'd just have
to keep movin' on.

32:08.187 --> 32:11.059
That, or just
chase the next cash job.

32:11.103 --> 32:14.367
Do you ever get to go back
and see your family
and friends in Florida?

32:14.410 --> 32:17.500
No, we haven't
been able to.

32:18.849 --> 32:23.767
Besides, my place
is with him now, right?

32:25.334 --> 32:27.554
Isn't that the wayit's supposed to be
for us ladies?

32:28.598 --> 32:30.949
Older man, kept woman.

32:33.473 --> 32:35.388
You want to know
what I'm thinking?

32:35.431 --> 32:39.087
Controlling man,
much younger woman,
kept on a tight leash.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.310
Well, I guess
to an extent I am.

32:45.441 --> 32:46.965
But he provides for me.

32:48.140 --> 32:49.141
I love him.

32:50.142 --> 32:52.231
And what about the bruise?

32:53.449 --> 32:57.149
Like I said,
tight spaces.

33:00.456 --> 33:03.546
Look, dude, I need to try
to find a way out of this.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.635
This guy is
absolutely insane,

33:05.679 --> 33:07.333
and he's gonna get
our asses thrown in jail.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.685
No. I don't think
you understand.

33:11.728 --> 33:13.643
This guy is literally crazy,

33:13.687 --> 33:15.297
and I don't know
what I've got myself into,

33:15.341 --> 33:19.475
but this a very dangerous man
that I am working for.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.913
- Brought you lunch.
- Thank you. Thanks.

33:22.957 --> 33:25.220
Thought we'd get a fresh start,
get things back on track.

33:29.833 --> 33:30.965
What's this?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.010
Payday.

33:35.143 --> 33:36.536
That's a lot of cash.

33:36.579 --> 33:38.625
There's a lot more
where that came from.

33:38.668 --> 33:41.019
You gotta be patient
and trust me, okay?

33:42.281 --> 33:43.195
You with me?

33:44.196 --> 33:45.284
Partner?

33:47.808 --> 33:48.939
Yeah.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.332
Get in the van.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.566
That was a funny story.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.568
- The first time.
- The first time, right, yeah.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.353
Oh, I meant to tell you

34:11.397 --> 34:13.834
that Tess came in
the store today.

34:13.877 --> 34:15.749
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:15.792 --> 34:18.230
You know, she's really
a sweet girl,

34:18.273 --> 34:19.927
but I'm a little
worried about her.

34:19.970 --> 34:22.147
I think she's being abused.

34:22.190 --> 34:25.150
Why am I not surprised?

34:25.193 --> 34:27.804
No, I mean-- She had
this bruise on her face,

34:27.848 --> 34:29.719
and when I asked her about it,
she just brushed it off

34:29.763 --> 34:30.938
and said she walked
into something,

34:30.981 --> 34:33.462
but I know that she was lying.

34:33.506 --> 34:36.683
Just be careful, okay?
You don't know these people.

34:36.726 --> 34:40.121
Just... don't get
involved in anything

34:40.165 --> 34:41.601
you don't want to
get involved in.

34:41.644 --> 34:43.690
Well, how can I not?
I mean, the poor girl

34:43.733 --> 34:45.779
doesn't have any
family or friends.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.476
I just want to help if I can.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.999
But I'll-I'll be careful.

34:49.043 --> 34:52.090
I'll just--
I'll just see how it goes.

34:52.133 --> 34:55.093
Just be careful,
you know nothing about them.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.616
Tread lightly.

34:57.965 --> 35:00.141
I'll clean up,
I'll get the wine out there.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.752
Why don't you gorelax on the balcony,
enjoy the sunset?

35:02.796 --> 35:04.928
Sounds good,
but how come I think

35:04.972 --> 35:06.887
that this is just
an excuse for you
to have a cigar?

35:06.930 --> 35:09.542
- Because it absolutely is.
- Yeah, it is.

35:22.685 --> 35:25.819
Peter, I am beat.
I've got to get to bed.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.864
But the fireworks
aren't over yet.

35:27.908 --> 35:30.693
I know, but, you know,
every Thursday, it's beautiful.

35:30.737 --> 35:33.218
I just--I gotta get to sleep.
I have a big day tomorrow, okay?

35:33.261 --> 35:35.307
- I'll be in in a minute.
- All right, I love you.

35:35.350 --> 35:36.960
- Love you, too.
- Mm.

36:10.994 --> 36:13.171
Sixty-five-footer, huh?

36:13.214 --> 36:17.566
I'm not sure we can
accommodate one that big.

36:17.610 --> 36:20.743
Well, yeah, sure,
I'd love to have him
as a-- as a tenant,

36:20.787 --> 36:25.313
but, uh, we'd have to get rid
of three smaller ones
to-to accommodate.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.405
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
That could work.

36:30.449 --> 36:33.147
Yeah. All right, let's talk
about it more later.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.322
Thanks, Jerry.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.160
Sailboat guy took the dinghy
to the shore today,

36:46.204 --> 36:48.554
but I haven't seen his wife
in a couple of days.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.338
You know,
come to think of it,

36:50.382 --> 36:52.993
I haven't seen her in the shop
or around town either.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.908
Peter,
I'm getting worried.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.172
What's weird is that...

36:58.216 --> 37:00.479
he was taking a bunch
of boxes to shore.

37:00.522 --> 37:04.396
I don't know what was in 'em,but maybe they were her things
and they broke up?

37:04.439 --> 37:06.485
You know what?
I hope they did break up.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.356
Honestly,
she deserves better,

37:08.400 --> 37:10.967
and I hope that she went back
to her family in Florida.

37:11.011 --> 37:12.534
You know, it's strange,
though, isn't it,

37:12.578 --> 37:16.103
that she didn't bring her things
with her when she left?

37:25.330 --> 37:26.809
Three dollars.

37:26.853 --> 37:29.595
Give me another one
of those dark beers.

37:31.814 --> 37:35.862
So you were saying you spent
some time in the sandbox, huh?

37:35.905 --> 37:40.040
Yet, it always felt likesuch a lonely place,
didn't it?

37:40.083 --> 37:42.869
So damn far from home.

37:42.912 --> 37:44.871
You'd hear men
crying at night,

37:44.914 --> 37:46.742
thinking about
everything they missed.

37:46.786 --> 37:50.224
The guys,they could never figure out
even why we were there.

37:51.878 --> 37:53.836
I knew exactly
why I was there.

37:55.098 --> 37:56.535
The money.

37:56.578 --> 37:59.320
Where I come from,
military pays good money.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.974
Good benefits, too.

38:02.497 --> 38:04.499
You didn't feel likeyou were serving
your country?

38:06.806 --> 38:09.330
I was supply sergeant, man.

38:09.374 --> 38:15.162
I had a great scam going--
cigarettes, booze, gasoline.

38:15.205 --> 38:16.598
It was great.

38:16.642 --> 38:19.384
Then the goddamn lieutenant
ratted me out.

38:19.427 --> 38:22.212
Dishonorable discharge.

38:22.256 --> 38:26.347
Lost my benefits,
I can't even go
to the goddamn VA.

38:26.391 --> 38:30.612
I don't feel like you deserve
to call yourself a soldier.

38:30.656 --> 38:34.268
Well, I don't feel like
you deserve to sit at this bar

38:34.312 --> 38:37.532
unless you're willin'
to go leave on a stretcher.

38:37.576 --> 38:41.188
Hey, guys,
cut it out or get out.

38:41.231 --> 38:43.146
I don't need
any of this crap in here.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.019
I'm done anyway.

39:24.057 --> 39:25.754
"Crush & Grind."

39:25.798 --> 39:27.147
Crush or grind?

39:27.190 --> 39:29.845
- Oh, crush, of course.
-

39:33.849 --> 39:36.635
Ah, this place looks great
since the renovations, huh?

39:36.678 --> 39:38.724
It does. Dominic
did most of the work.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.813
- Gosh, how did you know?
-  Always.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.336
Thanks.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.424
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it, Dom.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.736
It's nice to go
where everyone
knows your name.

39:52.259 --> 39:56.655
Hey, take a look at who's
sitting at the bar, alone.

39:58.134 --> 40:01.224
Is that sailboat neighbor?

40:01.268 --> 40:03.749
In the flesh?
He looks creepier in person.

40:04.924 --> 40:07.361
You should go over
and say hello.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.668
And what exactly
am I supposed to say?

40:09.711 --> 40:11.931
"Hey, neighbor, uh,
we've been watching you,

40:11.974 --> 40:13.585
and uh--
for weeks now,

40:13.628 --> 40:16.501
and we're wondering
what happened to your wife."

40:16.544 --> 40:20.809
That's not what I'm saying.
Just-just go make small talk.

40:20.853 --> 40:22.637
Just-just go talk to him.

40:22.681 --> 40:26.511
Okay, okay, I'll go,
but if I'm not back
in ten minutes...

40:27.512 --> 40:29.035
wait a little longer.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.430
Hey, neighbor.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.215
I know you?

40:35.258 --> 40:37.304
You live on the, uh--

40:37.347 --> 40:39.698
that little black sailboat
on the canal,

40:39.741 --> 40:42.483
in the waterway, right?
The little mini-pirate ship.

40:42.527 --> 40:45.225
Why you askin'
about where I live?

40:45.268 --> 40:47.662
I'm sorry, that was
an awkward conversation starter.

40:47.706 --> 40:51.492
My name is Peter Wright.I, uh, live with my wife,
Amanda,

40:51.536 --> 40:54.060
in the high rise right--
right above your boat there.

40:54.103 --> 40:57.019
It kind of makes us neighbors.

40:58.151 --> 40:59.239
Neighbors?

41:00.370 --> 41:03.025
So, um, what is it,
a 32-foot?

41:03.069 --> 41:04.766
It's 38, actually.

41:04.810 --> 41:07.116
It's a nice boat.
Have you had her long?

41:08.814 --> 41:12.165
Who do you live there with, uh,
your wife or your girlfriend?

41:12.208 --> 41:15.516
I always wonder what it'd
be like to live off the grid.

41:17.039 --> 41:19.781
Off the grid.
Yeah, you could say that.

41:19.825 --> 41:22.784
You could also say
I like my privacy.

41:22.828 --> 41:24.177
Understand?

41:27.485 --> 41:30.705
Well, I didn't mean
to come across as a creeper.

41:30.749 --> 41:34.013
My apologies. I'll let you
get back to your evening.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.624
Nice to meet you.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.805
How'd it go?

41:45.938 --> 41:50.159
I don't think we're gonna be
invited on the boat for drinks.

41:50.203 --> 41:52.901
Uh, did he say
anything about Tess?

41:52.945 --> 41:56.688
Um, he got really weird
when I mentioned her.

41:57.689 --> 41:58.733
Weird, how?

42:00.169 --> 42:03.477
Almost like he thought
I knew something.

42:06.698 --> 42:09.701
I don't know, I'm not
real comfortable
with this guy.

42:10.702 --> 42:11.833
Wanna head out?

42:12.834 --> 42:14.444
Okay, yeah.

42:31.636 --> 42:33.289
I don't knowif this rain's
gonna calm down.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.465
Maybe we should
just call it a day.

42:35.509 --> 42:37.163
No, I think
it's gonna clear up.

42:39.078 --> 42:43.386
Did you everget that check cashed
from that siding job we did?

42:43.430 --> 42:46.607
Damn, boy. What'd you do
with all that money
I gave you the other day?

42:46.651 --> 42:48.566
I got bills to pay, too.

42:51.264 --> 42:55.790
And, uh, did you ever
take care of that DUI?

42:55.834 --> 42:58.184
He told me he was
gonna get it continued.

43:10.370 --> 43:12.807
It's a little something
to nibble on.

43:12.851 --> 43:13.678
Mm, nice.

43:15.462 --> 43:17.377
I love it here, Peter.

43:17.420 --> 43:19.074
Yeah, me too.

43:19.118 --> 43:23.426
You know, just the whole
vibe of it, the people.

43:24.427 --> 43:26.038
You know what I really love?

43:26.081 --> 43:30.259
Sitting up here,seeing all this,
next to you.

43:30.303 --> 43:32.218
- A little corny, isn't it?

43:32.261 --> 43:34.002
Yeah, but it's nice.

43:34.046 --> 43:35.613
Oh, hey,
before I forget.

43:35.656 --> 43:37.266
Tomorrow night
I have that chamber event,

43:37.310 --> 43:39.225
so I'm just gonna be
back home late, okay?

43:39.268 --> 43:40.487
I did forget about that.

43:40.530 --> 43:42.750
Okay, I'll find
something else to do.

43:51.672 --> 43:53.674
Hey, neighbor.

43:53.718 --> 43:55.720
I figured this was
the right place.

43:55.763 --> 43:58.113
You must havea hell of a view
from up there.

43:58.157 --> 43:59.549
Can I help you
with something?

44:00.550 --> 44:02.335
You know...

44:02.378 --> 44:04.772
I felt kind of bad about
how I behaved the other night.

44:04.816 --> 44:06.687
I wanted to apologize.

44:06.731 --> 44:09.908
Sometimes I can be
a real asshole when I drink.

44:09.951 --> 44:12.475
So I'd like to invite you
over to my boat for a beer.

44:12.519 --> 44:14.042
What do you say?

44:14.086 --> 44:17.089
Maybe it's nota penthouse view,
but I call it home.

44:17.132 --> 44:18.307
How's four o'clock for you?

44:19.613 --> 44:21.006
Sure, why not?

44:21.049 --> 44:23.269
All right, I'll see you
at four o'clock, neighbor.

44:25.837 --> 44:27.447
I know, it's
the craziest thing.

44:27.490 --> 44:30.668
He shows up
to apologize.

44:30.711 --> 44:34.584
I think
I was so shocked,
I just said yes.

44:36.456 --> 44:38.763
You know,
I don't know.

44:39.764 --> 44:41.896
Ye-yeah, yes.

44:44.420 --> 44:47.728
Honestly, I don't know.

44:47.772 --> 44:49.687
But it's--
I'm gonna go anyway.

44:51.253 --> 44:53.778
I will. I love you.

45:11.012 --> 45:13.101
Permission to come aboard.

45:13.145 --> 45:14.320
Granted.

45:33.121 --> 45:34.514
So what's it like, uh,

45:34.557 --> 45:37.691
you and the lady,
living here all off the grid?

45:37.735 --> 45:39.127
Two of us?

45:40.128 --> 45:41.608
I'm a bachelor, man.

45:41.651 --> 45:44.393
I live on this lady
all by myself.

45:44.437 --> 45:47.266
Like you said,
peace and quiet,
off the grid.

45:47.309 --> 45:50.138
I'm sorry, I could swear
I've seen you here

45:50.182 --> 45:53.272
with a-a blonde woman,
your wife or girlfriend.

45:53.315 --> 45:54.447
That was my sister.

45:54.490 --> 45:55.970
Family, you know.

45:56.014 --> 45:57.842
It's great
until they come to stay.

45:57.885 --> 45:59.844
Hm. Hm.

45:59.887 --> 46:03.761
So how long you been watching me
from up there, penthouse man?

46:03.804 --> 46:06.981
Uh, a couple of months,
since we moved in.

46:10.202 --> 46:12.770
Where's the head?I want to use
the head real quick.

46:12.813 --> 46:14.772
Down below, forward, starboard
side.

46:16.425 --> 46:18.819
Grab another beer
if you want.
Get me one.

46:20.255 --> 46:22.127
And don't mind the mess.

46:22.170 --> 46:24.172
I'm a bachelor, you know?

47:15.136 --> 47:17.617
Saw your military stuff
down there.

47:18.923 --> 47:20.359
How long were you in?

47:20.402 --> 47:21.926
Eight years.

47:21.969 --> 47:23.014
Wow.

47:24.450 --> 47:26.844
Four deployments in Iraq.

47:26.887 --> 47:28.628
Thank you for your service.

47:29.803 --> 47:32.284
You know,
I hate that shit.

47:33.851 --> 47:36.027
"Thank you
for your service," right?

47:36.070 --> 47:39.117
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

47:39.160 --> 47:41.728
Thank you for your service
to your country.

47:43.425 --> 47:46.689
I joined the army
because I needed a job.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.649
That's all.

47:49.692 --> 47:51.825
That's all, the money.

47:52.957 --> 47:55.394
And I never fit in either.

47:55.437 --> 47:57.657
I guess
I just didn't understand.

48:00.094 --> 48:02.923
What, are you
gonna patronize me now?

48:02.967 --> 48:05.186
What are you gonna do next,
say, "Happy Memorial Day"?

48:06.187 --> 48:07.797
Happy Memorial Day!

48:07.841 --> 48:11.366
Go ahead, say it.
"Happy fuckin' Memorial Day."

48:11.410 --> 48:14.935
What does Memorial Day
mean to you, huh? Nothin'!

48:14.979 --> 48:17.982
Memorial Day
is remembering
the men and women

48:18.025 --> 48:20.462
that were left behind
on the battlefield

48:20.506 --> 48:22.725
for this flag,
for this country,

48:22.769 --> 48:26.251
so you can be playing around
in wonderland here.

48:26.294 --> 48:29.254
You and your-your
bullshit friends.

48:29.297 --> 48:32.866
You don't know anything
about Memorial Day.

48:32.910 --> 48:35.738
I think you'd better
get the fuck off my boat, pal.

48:35.782 --> 48:36.870
"Neighbor."

48:40.482 --> 48:41.483
I'm sorry.

48:42.484 --> 48:43.529
Sorry!

48:49.839 --> 48:51.798
Amanda, I'm home.

48:53.234 --> 48:54.540
Amanda?

48:57.935 --> 48:59.023
Amanda?

49:03.375 --> 49:04.811
Amanda?

49:09.555 --> 49:11.165
Amanda, where the hell are you?

49:12.993 --> 49:15.778
Are you okay?
Why aren't you home?

49:20.087 --> 49:22.916
Oh, Jesus,
I'm sorry, that's right.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.439
Look, I--

49:27.703 --> 49:29.705
I'll tell you
what happened later.

49:50.944 --> 49:53.120
He swears he lives alone
on that boat,

49:53.164 --> 49:55.862
that the womanwe saw him with
was his sister,

49:55.905 --> 49:57.777
and that she was
just down for a visit.

49:57.820 --> 50:00.693
Well, that's definitely not
the story that she told me,

50:00.736 --> 50:03.043
if we're talking about
the same woman
I met at the shop.

50:03.087 --> 50:04.131
It's weird.

50:04.175 --> 50:06.307
But why would he
lie about her?

50:06.351 --> 50:08.527
When I wason board the boat,
below deck,

50:08.570 --> 50:11.573
I didn't see anythingthat indicated anyone else
was living there,

50:11.617 --> 50:14.576
not as much
as a second toothbrush.

50:14.620 --> 50:19.712
Oh, don't mention his time
in the military to him, okay?

50:19.755 --> 50:23.759
I found this little shrine
to his days in the army.

50:23.803 --> 50:25.500
He flipped his shit
when I mentioned

50:25.544 --> 50:27.067
"thank you for your service."

50:27.111 --> 50:31.202
Somethingabout him
that's very odd.

50:31.245 --> 50:33.334
I'm gonna find out
what it is.

50:33.378 --> 50:37.077
Peter, aren't you just getting
a little obsessed with this guy?

50:37.121 --> 50:39.166
I mean, first you
bought those binoculars,

50:39.210 --> 50:40.950
and then the telescope.

50:40.994 --> 50:44.041
I mean, yeah he sounds
totally weird, and dangerous,

50:44.084 --> 50:46.739
but I think we just need
to mind our business,
and drop it.

50:46.782 --> 50:51.178
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.
- Yeah, I am right.

50:51.222 --> 50:52.527
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

50:52.571 --> 50:54.007
- Good night.
- Good night.

51:25.995 --> 51:27.345
Peter Cain Wright?

51:27.388 --> 51:29.129
Can I help you?

51:29.173 --> 51:30.913
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

51:30.957 --> 51:32.567
You want
to step out, please?

51:32.611 --> 51:34.221
What's this all about?

51:34.265 --> 51:36.267
Turn around, sir.

51:36.310 --> 51:39.618
Uh, you'll get the details
down at the station.

51:40.793 --> 51:43.839
What did I do?
What did I do?

51:44.840 --> 51:46.015
You'll find out.

51:59.681 --> 52:01.161
- Peter!
- Stay back, ma'am.

52:01.205 --> 52:02.728
Wh-what happened?

52:02.771 --> 52:04.773
I don't know, call our lawyer.
It's a misunderstanding.

52:04.817 --> 52:07.124
- Wh-what's going on?
- I don't know. Call--

52:41.375 --> 52:43.856
So...

52:43.899 --> 52:47.338
what was your relationship
like with Mr. Charles Owens?

52:47.381 --> 52:52.343
There's no relationship.
We can see him
from our balcony.

52:53.692 --> 52:55.520
- So you watch him?
- Well, yeah.

52:55.563 --> 52:57.870
We-we watch
all the boaters, it's fun.

52:57.913 --> 52:59.524
It's-- They're
our neighbors.

53:00.873 --> 53:02.396
Were you on the sailboat
the other night?

53:02.440 --> 53:05.225
Yeah, he invited me over
for some drinks.

53:05.269 --> 53:07.923
He drank,
I didn't finish a beer.

53:09.751 --> 53:11.536
I want to show you this.
Take a look at this.

53:12.928 --> 53:14.452
That was the other night
on the boat.

53:14.495 --> 53:16.454
I told you,
he invited me on
board.

53:16.497 --> 53:19.021
Yeah,
security camera footage.

53:19.065 --> 53:24.244
Mr. Owens called us concerned
when his camera recorded this.

53:25.376 --> 53:26.942
So-so what?

53:26.986 --> 53:29.423
That-that's me on the boat.

53:29.467 --> 53:30.946
Yeah, that would be fine,

53:30.990 --> 53:34.602
except Mr. Owens says
you weren't invited on board.

53:35.603 --> 53:37.257
- What?
- Yeah.

53:37.301 --> 53:39.651
He-he invited me
on the boat.

53:40.652 --> 53:42.044
Let me ask you something.

53:42.088 --> 53:43.785
Does this look like
a guest invited on board,

53:43.829 --> 53:46.223
or does it look like someone
that doesn't belong there?

53:49.138 --> 53:50.052
Huh?

53:52.925 --> 53:54.187
I think you got a problem.

53:55.884 --> 53:58.539
You're being charged
with one count
of criminal trespassing,

53:58.583 --> 54:00.628
and one count
of criminal stalking.

54:02.848 --> 54:04.284
Here you go, Mrs. Wright.

54:04.328 --> 54:07.461
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

54:07.505 --> 54:09.376
I mean, like I was telling you,
you know, Peter and I,

54:09.420 --> 54:11.291
we just, you know,
we watch the boats

54:11.335 --> 54:14.033
coming in and out of the canal,
normal, like everyone else does.

54:14.076 --> 54:15.469
You know and...

54:15.513 --> 54:17.384
I mean, there was
this-this couple there.

54:17.428 --> 54:19.952
- This-this guy and this--
- A-a woman?

54:19.995 --> 54:21.519
- Yes.
- Okay.

54:21.562 --> 54:24.348
- Her name is Tess, and, um--
- Do you know her?

54:24.391 --> 54:28.352
No, no, I don't--
I don't know her,
I was getting to know her.

54:28.395 --> 54:30.441
I mean, you know,
it's a small town, we--

54:30.484 --> 54:32.356
You know,
when someone new comes in,

54:32.399 --> 54:34.140
you know, you just--
you know. They stand out.

54:34.183 --> 54:35.663
- And...
- Okay.

54:35.707 --> 54:38.057
We just got to talking,
and, um, I don't know,

54:38.100 --> 54:40.320
she just--
she seemed sad or lonely.

54:40.364 --> 54:43.410
But, um, I mean,
I don't really know
anything about her.

54:43.454 --> 54:45.586
- Just something
was wrong with her.
- Did she tell you that?

54:45.630 --> 54:49.373
No, I mean,
I'm just-just saying,
you know, women's instinct.

54:49.416 --> 54:50.809
There's just
something off there.

54:51.810 --> 54:52.985
Is-- Can I see him?

54:53.028 --> 54:55.509
Is he here somewhere?

54:55.553 --> 54:58.425
Well, you know what?
It's gonna be a while

54:58.469 --> 55:00.253
before your husband
will be free to go.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.603
So, you know,
we really appreciate

55:02.647 --> 55:04.866
all the information
you've given us.

55:04.910 --> 55:07.608
Uh, why don't you go home
for a while?

55:07.652 --> 55:09.871
There's really no reason
for you to wait around.

55:09.915 --> 55:12.570
We'll call youwhen he's ready
to be released.

55:12.613 --> 55:15.399
And, uh,
don't go anywhere.

55:15.442 --> 55:16.791
Women's intuition.

56:00.879 --> 56:02.576
Are you okay?

56:03.577 --> 56:05.623
Yeah, I'm...

56:05.666 --> 56:08.843
I just wantto get inside
and take a shower.

56:10.802 --> 56:14.196
The detective
said that you were
sneaking around on his boat.

56:14.240 --> 56:16.242
Sneaking around?

56:16.285 --> 56:19.593
That crazy bastard
invited me on board his boat.

56:19.637 --> 56:21.421
Peter, I saw the video!

56:21.465 --> 56:23.858
Amanda, listen to me.

56:23.902 --> 56:26.078
The morning after
we met him in the bar,

56:26.121 --> 56:29.821
he was waiting for me
in our parking lot, right here.

56:29.864 --> 56:33.041
He said he wanted to apologizefor being a jerk
the night before,

56:33.085 --> 56:38.133
and-and invite meon board his boat as a--
to make things right.

56:38.177 --> 56:40.875
Peter, what's going on?

56:40.919 --> 56:43.574
I don't know.

56:43.617 --> 56:45.924
I'm damn well
gonna find out.

56:45.967 --> 56:49.493
Well, just don't do
anything else stupid.

57:03.202 --> 57:04.986
Slow start
to your day, Pete?

57:06.118 --> 57:08.250
Long end to yesterday.

57:09.382 --> 57:10.775
Something happen?

57:10.818 --> 57:13.560
Uh, nothing that won't
work itself out.

57:13.604 --> 57:15.606
Legal problems
usually do.

57:17.259 --> 57:19.261
It's a small island.

57:19.305 --> 57:22.090
Gee, news travels fast.

57:22.134 --> 57:23.744
It's a complete shitshow.

57:23.788 --> 57:25.746
This guy who lives
on this sailboat,

57:25.790 --> 57:27.922
he-he sets me up!

57:27.966 --> 57:29.881
Don't worry,
we've all got your back.

57:32.231 --> 57:34.451
Thank you, Kate,
I appreciate it.

57:41.545 --> 57:42.850
Look, I met her in a bar.

57:42.894 --> 57:44.330
She came home with me
to my boat,

57:44.373 --> 57:45.810
and I thought
she'd spend the night,

57:45.853 --> 57:47.638
but she ended up staying
three or four days.

57:47.681 --> 57:49.640
Then I came home
one day from work,

57:49.683 --> 57:52.469
and all her stuff was gone,
and I never saw her again.

57:52.512 --> 57:55.428
Well, do you know who she was?
Do you have a name for me?

57:56.951 --> 57:59.084
Look, I never
got her name.

57:59.127 --> 58:00.433
I just
called her "baby."

58:01.434 --> 58:02.522
You know how it is.

58:02.566 --> 58:04.481
No, I don't.

58:48.350 --> 58:50.178
Maybe it was a dream.

58:51.440 --> 58:53.530
Yeah, sure,
and maybe it was a dream

58:53.573 --> 58:57.577
that I had drinks
with crazy sailboat guy
out there last night.

58:57.621 --> 59:01.102
I'm not saying all that,I'm just saying the whole thing
sounds just a little strange.

59:01.146 --> 59:03.975
I know what I saw,
Amanda, okay?

59:04.018 --> 59:06.978
Someone was trying
to get in this house.

59:07.021 --> 59:09.763
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it was the wind.

59:09.807 --> 59:11.939
It wasn't the wind, Amanda!

59:36.877 --> 59:39.314
You know...

59:39.358 --> 59:41.534
it's better
to mind your own business

59:41.578 --> 59:44.276
than to risk
opening Pandora's Box.

59:44.319 --> 59:46.539
What's your problem, man?

59:46.583 --> 59:49.629
Do you have any idea
the trouble you're causing us?

59:49.673 --> 59:53.764
Just making sure thingsthat are squared away
stay that way.

59:53.807 --> 59:55.766
What are you talking about?

59:55.809 --> 59:58.638
You told the police
I'm stalking you?

59:59.900 --> 1:00:01.772
What did you actually see?

1:00:01.815 --> 1:00:06.298
A guy doing spring cleaning,getting rid of some
excess baggage.

1:00:06.341 --> 1:00:08.300
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

1:00:08.343 --> 1:00:11.869
Things that arebelow the surface
are better left that way.

1:00:27.449 --> 1:00:29.364
- Baby, get up.
- What?

1:00:29.408 --> 1:00:30.931
Get in the bathroom,
and lock the door.

1:00:30.975 --> 1:00:32.541
- What-what? What's going on?
- I don't know.

1:00:32.585 --> 1:00:34.239
Get in the bathroom,
lock the door.

1:00:46.164 --> 1:00:47.252
Damn it.

1:01:29.076 --> 1:01:31.035
-

1:01:36.344 --> 1:01:37.519
What was it?

1:01:37.563 --> 1:01:39.478
Nothing. False alarm.

1:01:40.522 --> 1:01:42.263
Then what would've set it off?

1:01:42.307 --> 1:01:43.656
Who knows?

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:46.050
The door is locked,
the chain is on.

1:01:47.355 --> 1:01:48.487
We're okay.

1:01:50.445 --> 1:01:52.404
Please, call the alarm
company today.

1:01:52.447 --> 1:01:53.971
See if they cansend someone out
to fix that,

1:01:54.014 --> 1:01:56.451
because I can't haveanother episode
like last night.

1:01:56.495 --> 1:01:58.149
It's on my list.

1:01:59.411 --> 1:02:01.892
Oh, and I have
an island woman's meeting

1:02:01.935 --> 1:02:03.807
at the shop today,
it's catered.

1:02:03.850 --> 1:02:05.460
Can I bring something back?

1:02:05.504 --> 1:02:07.245
I'll just eat leftovers.

1:02:09.377 --> 1:02:11.205
Well, take it easy,
all right?

1:02:11.249 --> 1:02:13.251
We got a lot of food.
I don't want it
to go to waste.

1:02:13.294 --> 1:02:15.557
Okay.
See you later.

1:02:15.601 --> 1:02:16.515
Okay.

1:02:17.516 --> 1:02:18.865
Love you!

1:02:22.086 --> 1:02:24.218
You have no idea, buddy.

1:02:31.530 --> 1:02:32.966
All right, buddy.

1:02:33.010 --> 1:02:35.142
Gotta go to work.
You have a good day, okay?

1:02:35.186 --> 1:02:36.709
Be good. Be good boy.

1:02:40.060 --> 1:02:44.935
Yeah, hi, I need a service call
on my alarm system.

1:02:44.978 --> 1:02:47.111
Well, it's randomly going off.

1:02:49.026 --> 1:02:51.550
Yeah, the doors
and windows are all locked.

1:02:53.117 --> 1:02:55.162
Yeah, tomorrow
would be great.

1:02:55.206 --> 1:02:58.862
Yeah, I appreciate that.
All right, thank you.

1:06:06.614 --> 1:06:08.399
Wow.

1:06:08.442 --> 1:06:11.924
This sounds like the script
for a movie or something.

1:06:11.968 --> 1:06:13.752
It's just unbelievable.

1:06:15.058 --> 1:06:16.581
When I saw Peter
on the news the other night,

1:06:16.624 --> 1:06:17.799
I just didn't know
what to think.

1:06:17.843 --> 1:06:19.279
That's just not
in his character.

1:06:20.411 --> 1:06:22.369
Well, welcome
to my world.

1:06:22.413 --> 1:06:24.763
This whole thing
is just so bizarre.

1:06:24.806 --> 1:06:27.592
You know? I mean,
he's not talking to me.

1:06:27.635 --> 1:06:30.638
And his obsession
with this couple,
it's just strange.

1:06:30.682 --> 1:06:32.466
- Mm.
- I don't know, honestly,

1:06:32.510 --> 1:06:36.035
I... I'm just--
I'm just a little scared.

1:06:36.079 --> 1:06:38.385
Well, you have
every right to be scared.

1:06:38.429 --> 1:06:42.346
I mean, you have police,
and crazy accusations.

1:06:42.389 --> 1:06:45.001
It's like your whole world
is being torn apart.

1:06:46.524 --> 1:06:47.568
But...

1:06:49.266 --> 1:06:55.794
have you considered that maybe
he did see something?

1:06:55.837 --> 1:06:58.797
Remember, you saidthere was something weird
with that girl on the boat.

1:07:00.277 --> 1:07:02.627
I mean, what if he
did witness something happen?

1:07:02.670 --> 1:07:05.847
I mean, that'sthe whole thing, right?
I mean, why wouldn't he tell me?

1:07:05.891 --> 1:07:07.936
The whole thing
just doesn't make any sense.

1:07:07.980 --> 1:07:10.591
Yeah. Hmm.

1:07:10.635 --> 1:07:12.724
Well, what are you
gonna do next?

1:07:12.767 --> 1:07:14.987
Just wait for the police
to do their job

1:07:15.031 --> 1:07:16.641
and straighten
this whole thing out.

1:07:18.338 --> 1:07:21.472
Well, I wishthere was more I could do
to help you, Amanda.

1:07:21.515 --> 1:07:24.257
Honestly, I just-- I'm so glad
to just get out of the house

1:07:24.301 --> 1:07:25.867
and just clear my head,

1:07:25.911 --> 1:07:28.783
and I really appreciate you
listening to me,

1:07:28.827 --> 1:07:30.481
just so I know
that I'm not crazy.

1:07:30.524 --> 1:07:31.960
You are not crazy.

1:07:32.004 --> 1:07:34.702
And any time you
want to talk, okay?

1:07:37.792 --> 1:07:39.142
It'll all work out.

1:08:19.921 --> 1:08:21.401
Where are you going?

1:08:21.445 --> 1:08:24.317
I gotta take care of something.
I'll be back in a bit.

1:08:24.361 --> 1:08:26.667
But you have that appointment
about the Bayliner
in 20 minutes.

1:08:26.711 --> 1:08:28.365
Have Jerry
take care of it.

1:09:17.109 --> 1:09:19.329
I need to speak with
Detective Martinez.

1:09:19.372 --> 1:09:20.591
What's this about?

1:09:20.634 --> 1:09:22.201
It's about my case.

1:09:22.245 --> 1:09:23.985
Do you have a case number?

1:09:24.029 --> 1:09:26.074
No, I don't have
a damn case number!

1:09:26.118 --> 1:09:29.469
Hey, is there
a problem out here?

1:09:30.470 --> 1:09:32.342
Wait a minute.

1:09:32.385 --> 1:09:35.693
And you need to take that minute
to roll back your attitude.

1:09:40.001 --> 1:09:43.135
The detective will be
out to see you in a minute.

1:09:49.228 --> 1:09:50.577
For the second time
this week,

1:09:50.621 --> 1:09:52.188
somebody tried to
break into our condo.

1:09:52.231 --> 1:09:55.103
This time, they set
the security alarm off.

1:09:55.147 --> 1:09:57.018
But you didn't make
any contact.

1:09:57.062 --> 1:09:59.499
No, but I'm sure
it was Charles Owens.

1:10:00.979 --> 1:10:04.548
But you didn't see Mr. Owens?
You see anybody?

1:10:04.591 --> 1:10:07.594
- No, not actually.
- Did you see anybody?

1:10:07.638 --> 1:10:11.859
Look, I heard the knob wiggle.
Who-who is it gonna be?
I mean...

1:10:14.079 --> 1:10:15.907
How about your wife?
She hear anything?

1:10:16.951 --> 1:10:18.736
She didn't even wake up.

1:10:19.954 --> 1:10:21.869
And why do you
think it was Owens? Huh?

1:10:21.913 --> 1:10:24.394
Look, I've got
nothing to prove it, okay?

1:10:24.437 --> 1:10:26.265
But put
the pieces together.

1:10:26.309 --> 1:10:29.442
Okay, let's do that,
let's put the pieces together.

1:10:29.486 --> 1:10:32.097
All right? We have a complaint
from Charles Owens,

1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:34.752
that you broke in
and stole his property.

1:10:34.795 --> 1:10:36.536
The difference between his story
and yours?

1:10:36.580 --> 1:10:39.235
He's got proof,
and you got nothing.

1:10:39.278 --> 1:10:41.802
Well, what about
the security alarm, then?

1:10:41.846 --> 1:10:45.284
What about it?
It happens a hundred times.

1:10:45.328 --> 1:10:47.417
All right?
Nothing criminal about that.

1:10:49.070 --> 1:10:50.420
Well, there's-there's
something else.

1:10:51.421 --> 1:10:52.770
What is it?

1:10:52.813 --> 1:10:55.251
I was out
for my morning jog this morning.

1:10:56.817 --> 1:10:59.429
Owens is in my parking lot,
he confronts me.

1:10:59.472 --> 1:11:04.869
He's talking about some thing
about spring cleaning.

1:11:04.912 --> 1:11:06.566
He was mocking me.

1:11:06.610 --> 1:11:08.220
That it?

1:11:08.264 --> 1:11:11.179
Look, I think he killed
the woman he was with.

1:11:12.180 --> 1:11:14.226
Listen...

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:17.664
I'd like to believe your story,
I really would.

1:11:17.708 --> 1:11:21.581
But, the fact of the matter is,
you got no video,

1:11:21.625 --> 1:11:24.323
you got no proof,
you got nothing.

1:11:24.367 --> 1:11:28.501
All right?When you got something
that I can use, let me know.

1:11:29.807 --> 1:11:32.070
Yeah, that's-that's
great, great.

1:11:32.113 --> 1:11:33.637
Great.

1:11:40.426 --> 1:11:41.993
So the numbers
look right?

1:11:42.036 --> 1:11:43.777
Want to go inside
and so some paperwork?

1:11:43.821 --> 1:11:46.345
Uh, I don't know.
I think I'm gonna
wait a bit.

1:11:46.389 --> 1:11:47.868
But I thought
we had a deal?

1:11:47.912 --> 1:11:50.001
I've got your number.
I'll give you a call.

1:11:50.044 --> 1:11:51.829
Well, if you change
your mind, please.

1:11:51.872 --> 1:11:52.917
Okay.

1:11:56.616 --> 1:11:58.618
Peter, can you
come to the office?

1:11:58.662 --> 1:11:59.793
Coming.

1:12:03.841 --> 1:12:05.712
What the hell just happened?

1:12:05.756 --> 1:12:06.974
That was a sure thing.

1:12:07.975 --> 1:12:09.499
Uh, and by the way,

1:12:09.542 --> 1:12:11.370
Bill Browning just extended
his lease for another year,

1:12:11.414 --> 1:12:12.545
but now he's pulling out.

1:12:13.546 --> 1:12:14.852
Great!

1:12:14.895 --> 1:12:16.984
Also, Bayliner guy
canceled his payment.

1:12:17.985 --> 1:12:19.335
What the hell is going on?

1:12:23.817 --> 1:12:25.645
Humphrey?

1:12:25.689 --> 1:12:27.473
Ready to go for a walk, boy?

1:12:44.447 --> 1:12:46.536
Humphrey?

1:12:46.579 --> 1:12:49.147
Where are you, boy?

1:12:53.369 --> 1:12:54.457
Humphrey?

1:13:08.819 --> 1:13:10.081
Peter?

1:13:10.124 --> 1:13:12.388
Do you have Humphrey?

1:13:12.431 --> 1:13:15.652
Um, I'm home,
and Humphrey's not here,

1:13:15.695 --> 1:13:19.569
and... something
is really wrong.

1:13:27.968 --> 1:13:30.275
He's usually homeduring the day
while we're at work.

1:13:30.318 --> 1:13:31.755
Usually?

1:13:31.798 --> 1:13:33.191
Well, I mean,
sometimes I take him

1:13:33.234 --> 1:13:34.627
to the marina, but not today.

1:13:34.671 --> 1:13:35.933
Are you sure?

1:13:35.976 --> 1:13:37.587
Maybe you forgot
to take him home?

1:13:37.630 --> 1:13:39.545
Seriously?

1:13:39.589 --> 1:13:40.851
What about the condo?

1:13:40.894 --> 1:13:42.374
Could he have
gotten out of here?

1:13:42.418 --> 1:13:44.507
We live on the 11th floor.

1:13:44.550 --> 1:13:47.031
You know,
there's something else.

1:13:47.074 --> 1:13:50.077
There-there was a brokenpicture frame on the wall
and glass everywhere.

1:13:51.644 --> 1:13:53.777
Well, couldn't it have just
fallen off the wall?

1:13:53.820 --> 1:13:55.474
No, that's not it.

1:13:55.518 --> 1:13:57.607
I mean, the pictures
were all moved around.

1:13:57.650 --> 1:13:59.173
The stuff was moved around.

1:13:59.217 --> 1:14:00.871
I mean, clearly, there was
someone in this place.

1:14:00.914 --> 1:14:03.047
It just--
it just didn't feel right.

1:14:03.090 --> 1:14:05.005
Was the locks on
when you came home?

1:14:05.049 --> 1:14:05.876
Yes.

1:14:06.877 --> 1:14:07.878
The sword's gone.

1:14:07.921 --> 1:14:09.357
Sword? What sword?

1:14:09.401 --> 1:14:11.055
There's a sword
that's-that's on the wall

1:14:11.098 --> 1:14:12.796
right next to this
suit of armor. It's gone.

1:14:12.839 --> 1:14:14.493
So you're saying
you're missing property?

1:14:14.537 --> 1:14:17.496
Yeah, yeah,
it never leaves this wall!

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:20.325
Well, now you're gonnaneed to file a separate
missing property report.

1:14:20.368 --> 1:14:21.587
What about our dog?

1:14:21.631 --> 1:14:23.328
Can you see
if Owens has our dog?

1:14:23.371 --> 1:14:25.025
Are you--
are you kiddin' me?

1:14:25.069 --> 1:14:27.637
For that I'm gonna need
a warrant and a probable cause.

1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:30.291
I mean, if I bring that
into the judge's chambers,

1:14:30.335 --> 1:14:32.293
you know what
he's gonna do? Huh?

1:14:32.337 --> 1:14:34.513
He's gonna laugh me
right out of there.

1:14:34.557 --> 1:14:35.993
That's what he's gonna do.

1:14:40.824 --> 1:14:44.392
Apparently, my arrest
is all over the island.

1:14:44.436 --> 1:14:47.134
I know, Tony told me
he saw it in the Gazette.

1:14:48.353 --> 1:14:49.659
Great.

1:14:52.139 --> 1:14:56.100
That, uh, guy who put
the deposit down
on the Bayliner,

1:14:56.143 --> 1:14:58.276
he canceled today.

1:14:58.319 --> 1:15:00.234
What? Why?

1:15:00.278 --> 1:15:02.236
He says he doesn't want to do
business with me

1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:04.238
until he sees
what happens with my case.

1:15:04.282 --> 1:15:06.327
Well,
that's just great.

1:15:06.371 --> 1:15:09.374
I told you that we should just
mind our own business and drop
it.

1:15:09.417 --> 1:15:11.289
And-and now we
have to deal with this.

1:15:11.332 --> 1:15:13.987
I mean, just-- Our lives
were normal two weeks ago,
Peter.

1:15:14.031 --> 1:15:18.122
You know, I could really usesome support from my wife
right now.

1:16:55.915 --> 1:16:57.438
Hey, boy.

1:16:57.482 --> 1:16:58.831
Hey, Humphrey.

1:16:58.875 --> 1:17:00.877
What'd he do to you?
What'd he do?
You okay?

1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:02.052
You all right?

1:17:15.979 --> 1:17:17.458
Oh, shit.
Humphrey, let's go.

1:17:17.502 --> 1:17:18.982
Let's hide. Come on, let's go.

1:17:21.637 --> 1:17:23.682
Bastard.

1:17:23.726 --> 1:17:24.988
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.

1:17:29.732 --> 1:17:33.779
Well, look who returned
to the scene of the crime,
huh, neighbor?

1:17:35.563 --> 1:17:37.348
Let's go.
Come on, come on. Let's go.

1:17:44.834 --> 1:17:46.313
Where you at, dopey?

1:17:57.629 --> 1:17:58.935
All right, Humphrey.

1:17:58.978 --> 1:18:01.067
This is where you
get to be brave.

1:18:01.111 --> 1:18:02.242
All right.

1:18:03.591 --> 1:18:05.898
Come on. Come on.

1:18:08.161 --> 1:18:09.380
Be right there.

1:18:14.907 --> 1:18:17.954
Yeah. It was easier
to get you out, Humphrey.

1:18:40.193 --> 1:18:41.847
Want to play games?

1:18:43.022 --> 1:18:45.633
All right,
I can play games.

1:18:45.677 --> 1:18:47.723
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1:19:10.702 --> 1:19:12.443
Come on out of there.

1:19:12.486 --> 1:19:14.619
Don't make me break
this door, you idiot.

1:19:22.105 --> 1:19:24.237
How long you want to play
this game, neighbor?

1:19:25.238 --> 1:19:26.152
Huh?

1:19:26.196 --> 1:19:28.372
I knew the night

1:19:28.415 --> 1:19:31.375
that you overstayed
your mooring ball

1:19:31.418 --> 1:19:33.116
that there was
something wrong.

1:19:34.421 --> 1:19:35.814
You know, you're starting to
sound

1:19:35.858 --> 1:19:37.773
more and more
like a stalker.

1:19:41.211 --> 1:19:43.561
Those boxes you offloaded,
what was in those, huh?

1:19:43.604 --> 1:19:45.824
You kill her? Huh?

1:19:45.868 --> 1:19:49.567
You really want--
You really want me to get
into the gory details, huh?

1:19:51.047 --> 1:19:54.137
Do you have any idea what you've
done to me?

1:19:54.180 --> 1:19:56.922
My wife? Our lives?

1:19:56.966 --> 1:20:00.012
Now you're getting
too sentimental.

1:20:00.056 --> 1:20:01.361
And I've had enough of you.

1:20:22.426 --> 1:20:24.123
What are you gonna
do with that, huh?

1:20:25.429 --> 1:20:26.865
You want to know
how I killed her?

1:20:27.910 --> 1:20:30.086
I choked her out,

1:20:30.129 --> 1:20:32.915
and then I weighted her body
down with weights,

1:20:32.958 --> 1:20:34.830
and I dropped her
in the canal.

1:20:36.614 --> 1:20:38.616
What are you gonna do
with that, Lancelot, huh?

1:20:39.747 --> 1:20:41.053
What are you gonna do?

1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:45.797
Fuck!

1:20:45.841 --> 1:20:47.320
-

1:20:54.850 --> 1:20:56.242
You fuckin'...

1:21:27.099 --> 1:21:30.233
Yes, that-that's her,
that's Tess.

1:21:30.276 --> 1:21:34.715
She came into the store,
and-and she looked so scared.

1:21:34.759 --> 1:21:36.152
I tried to talk to her.

1:21:36.195 --> 1:21:37.544
I just wanted
to help her, but...

1:21:37.588 --> 1:21:39.285
This poor girl.

1:21:41.287 --> 1:21:43.202
Detective?

1:21:43.246 --> 1:21:47.250
Oh, gosh!
That's the dress I sold her.

1:21:48.729 --> 1:21:51.036
Who was she, Detective?

1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:53.734
She and Charles
were common law
husband and wife.

1:21:53.778 --> 1:21:56.346
They would dock
in different ports
for weeks and months

1:21:56.389 --> 1:21:59.610
until they pissed someone off,
or he felt like he
needed to move on.

1:22:01.351 --> 1:22:05.311
When I was on the boat,
I saw something odd.

1:22:05.355 --> 1:22:08.358
It was a registration number
from a Florida boat,

1:22:08.401 --> 1:22:10.882
and it didn't match
the one on the-- on the hull.

1:22:10.926 --> 1:22:12.797
I took a picture of it.

1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:15.191
I guess we missed this
in our search.

1:22:15.234 --> 1:22:16.583
No wonder
we didn't find anything.

1:22:16.627 --> 1:22:18.716
- Hey, Officer Swenson?
- Yes, sir?

1:22:18.759 --> 1:22:20.326
Can you run this for me?

1:22:27.072 --> 1:22:28.204
So, um...

1:22:30.032 --> 1:22:32.904
Detective, what...
what happened to our dog?

1:22:33.905 --> 1:22:35.515
Uh, we found him.

1:22:35.559 --> 1:22:37.691
A couple of boaters found him
floating in your boat.

1:22:37.735 --> 1:22:39.084
Oh, thank God.
- Back at the station,

1:22:39.128 --> 1:22:41.260
entertaining some of
our officers.

1:22:41.304 --> 1:22:42.870
Good dog.

1:22:42.914 --> 1:22:45.699
You know, I was trying
to get him onto the boat.

1:22:45.743 --> 1:22:47.397
I was gonna go with him.

1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:49.703
When Owens came back,
I didn't have time to get away.

1:22:49.747 --> 1:22:52.315
Thank God there wasn't
more bullets in that gun.

1:22:52.358 --> 1:22:55.187
And thank God
for shaky hands.

1:22:56.449 --> 1:22:58.756
Detective?
That boat comes back

1:22:58.799 --> 1:23:00.323
stolen out of Florida
five years ago.

1:23:00.366 --> 1:23:02.368
- Thank you, Officer.
- There's more.

1:23:02.412 --> 1:23:06.285
It belonged to a woman
listed as deceased
by homicide.

1:23:08.070 --> 1:23:10.550
This is gonna open
Pandora's Box.

1:23:10.594 --> 1:23:14.859
Who knows how many
unsolved murders
this Owens is involved in.

1:23:14.902 --> 1:23:19.907
Well, hopefully,this will give closure
to one family's grief.

1:23:19.951 --> 1:23:24.173
So what happens now?
Do you notify Tess' family?

1:23:25.478 --> 1:23:27.393
What family? What friends?

1:23:27.437 --> 1:23:30.657
We don't even know Tess
was her real name.

1:23:30.701 --> 1:23:33.399
I mean, uh,
how about you two?

1:23:33.443 --> 1:23:35.662
Where do you guys
go from here?

1:23:35.706 --> 1:23:37.838
Well, I mean,
Carolina Beach is our home.

1:23:37.882 --> 1:23:39.362
We have family,
we have businesses here.

1:23:39.405 --> 1:23:41.364
We-- We're not
going anywhere.

1:23:41.407 --> 1:23:44.149
No, but we're not going back
to the penthouse either.

1:23:44.193 --> 1:23:45.672
We're gonna
have to list that.

1:23:45.716 --> 1:23:47.761
Maybe move back
to the lake condo?

1:23:47.805 --> 1:23:50.938
I mean, it doesn't have
such an exciting view, but...

1:23:50.982 --> 1:23:52.766
Well, you know what?

1:23:52.810 --> 1:23:54.333
Maybe that's a good thing.

1:24:18.401 --> 1:24:19.967
Kathy and Steve...

1:24:20.011 --> 1:24:22.057
welcome to Penthouse One.
