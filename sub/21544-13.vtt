00:12.161 --> 00:14.377
Ach, Webby, a crossbow?

00:14.417 --> 00:17.156
Uh! Sorry, Granny.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.470
That's better.

00:19.613 --> 00:21.723
- What's all this?
- Hey, guys!

00:21.800 --> 00:26.377
Every year I brush up on my
survivor skills on a secret island!

00:26.620 --> 00:29.085
I-I mean, a regular island

00:29.162 --> 00:31.236
where young warriors
definitely don't combat

00:31.313 --> 00:32.918
the forces of nature
and each other.

00:32.995 --> 00:34.845
You know, it's girl stuff.

00:36.476 --> 00:38.327
I gotta go!

00:38.404 --> 00:39.687
I gotta...

00:42.289 --> 00:43.606
Why is everyone running off?

00:43.683 --> 00:44.741
Ugh.

00:44.818 --> 00:46.822
You would figure it out
sooner or later.

00:46.899 --> 00:49.502
Today is
Mr. McDuck's birthday.

00:49.579 --> 00:50.850
His birthday?!

00:50.927 --> 00:53.647
Okay, people, we are in crisis
party-planning mode.

00:53.724 --> 00:56.056
- Louie, start a guest list. Dewey...
- Absolutely not.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.450
Mr. McDuck has a strict
no-birthday-party rule.

00:58.527 --> 01:00.072
He hates the reminder
that he's...

01:00.149 --> 01:02.181
Literally the oldest
person he knows?

01:02.653 --> 01:04.051
But our most epic relative

01:04.128 --> 01:06.694
<i>deserves</i> the most
epic party ever!

01:06.771 --> 01:08.838
Oh, I don't know.
He hasn't had a good one

01:08.915 --> 01:11.119
since before his old butler
Duckworth died.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.704
Like this stuffy old guy
could beat the party

01:13.781 --> 01:16.090
I threw for the Junior Woodchuck
Party Planning Committee.

01:16.167 --> 01:18.280
It was both work and play.

01:18.357 --> 01:20.525
Fine. Don't say
I didn't warn you.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.632
If I don't come back,
tell my story!

01:22.709 --> 01:24.400
Nah, he's gonna love it!

01:24.477 --> 01:27.189
Huey's time to shine!

01:28.156 --> 01:30.681
Another year older,
another year richer.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.480
I have the house to myself.

01:32.557 --> 01:35.736
Time to celebrate
with peace and quiet.

01:37.061 --> 01:38.580
Aah! A home invasion!

01:38.657 --> 01:41.283
Take that, you bionic bandit!

01:41.712 --> 01:43.359
Surprise!

01:43.781 --> 01:46.527
Happy B-b-birthday!

01:46.604 --> 01:48.252

02:52.932 --> 02:56.161
So, next is mingling
from 6:00 to 6:05.

02:56.238 --> 02:58.581
Bathroom break at 6:06,
but keep it under a minute,

02:58.658 --> 03:02.040
'cause at 6:07
we're scheduled to have fun!

03:02.117 --> 03:04.709
<i>A fun time!</i>

03:07.674 --> 03:10.131
What the blazes was that?

03:12.381 --> 03:15.420
Oh, just the one
and only DJ Daft Duck.

03:15.497 --> 03:18.622
<i>Yeah! What up, yo?</i>

03:18.699 --> 03:20.979
Dewey's only answering to his DJ
name tonight. Just go with it.

03:21.056 --> 03:23.495
Why are there a bunch
of masked weirdoes in my house?

03:23.572 --> 03:24.852
Louie put together a guest list

03:24.929 --> 03:27.826
of Duckburg's most powerful
and elite.

03:30.330 --> 03:32.154
It's about quality,
not quantity.

03:32.325 --> 03:34.604
Everyone here
is kind of a big deal.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.233
You know, we had to make it
a costume party

03:36.310 --> 03:37.706
to throw off the paparazzi.

03:37.783 --> 03:39.412
Get in the spirit!

03:41.207 --> 03:43.001
Or not. That's cool.

03:43.078 --> 03:45.912
Come on, hop aboard
the Happy Birthday Express!

03:46.090 --> 03:50.791
Toot toot! All aboard for a
jumbo word search about you!

03:50.868 --> 03:52.160
Pass.

03:52.421 --> 03:54.474
Next up, musical chairs!

03:54.551 --> 03:57.123
Or we could sit in silence.

03:57.284 --> 04:00.279
Balloon Pop Relay
coming into the station!

04:00.824 --> 04:02.709
Station's closed.

04:03.098 --> 04:04.724
Staff meeting!

04:07.786 --> 04:09.729
I don't think Scrooge
wants a party.

04:09.806 --> 04:11.808
That's crazy!
There've been a few bumps,

04:11.885 --> 04:13.039
but he'll come around.

04:13.116 --> 04:15.174
Louie, no schmoozing.
Just serve punch.

04:15.251 --> 04:17.200
Dewey. Dewey.

04:18.481 --> 04:20.363
DJ Daft Duck?

04:21.164 --> 04:22.617
Here's a list
of pre-approved songs

04:22.694 --> 04:24.638
with a 90% enjoyment
rating. Play these.

04:24.777 --> 04:26.293
Listen, I know
planning is your thing,

04:26.370 --> 04:27.952
but you're cramping our style.

04:28.029 --> 04:31.075
You gotta relax
and just ride the party wave.

04:34.296 --> 04:36.348
A party is
a celebration of a life,

04:36.425 --> 04:38.255
bringing people together
to let the guest the honor

04:38.323 --> 04:39.641
know how much they're loved.

04:39.718 --> 04:41.795
Uncle Scrooge has done
so much for us!

04:41.872 --> 04:44.083
This is our chance
to do something for him!

04:44.160 --> 04:47.195
By forcing him to have fun at a
party he doesn't want to be at?

04:47.272 --> 04:48.551
I knew you'd understand.

04:49.738 --> 04:51.027
Oh, boy.

04:51.995 --> 04:54.406
Oh-ho, there's the birthday boy!

04:54.483 --> 04:58.033
I've got just the thing to help
get you into the party mood!

04:58.110 --> 04:59.521
Cue lights.

05:01.527 --> 05:03.424
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:03.501 --> 05:04.703
grand illusionist,

05:04.780 --> 05:09.052
Master of the Arcane
Nik Nokturne!

05:09.855 --> 05:11.523
Spelled with two K's,

05:11.600 --> 05:14.552
'cause I made the C's...
<i>disappear!</i>

05:14.831 --> 05:18.501
Oh, if there's one thing I hate
more than birthday parties,

05:18.578 --> 05:21.325
it's birthday party
magicians. Ugh!

05:21.455 --> 05:24.638
Well, good thing
he's an illusionist, then!

05:27.034 --> 05:29.880
Choose your destiny.

05:38.146 --> 05:41.499
The card's in his pocket
next to a dove.

05:43.206 --> 05:44.465
You're not helping!

05:44.542 --> 05:46.022
You, nonbeliever,

05:46.099 --> 05:49.288
come forth to experience
<i>real</i> magic!

05:50.857 --> 05:54.726
Behold, the Abyss Box!

05:55.520 --> 05:56.540
Nope.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.403
But, Uncle Scrooge, you have to!

05:58.480 --> 05:59.835
For the party.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.398
Oh, fine.

06:02.498 --> 06:06.178
Who knows what mysteries
wait inside?

06:06.255 --> 06:07.517
To be clear,
you want me

06:07.594 --> 06:10.031
to hide inside this
trap door in here?

06:11.482 --> 06:14.765
Embrace the pull
of the darkness!

06:14.927 --> 06:18.937
I call upon the spirits...

06:21.304 --> 06:24.218
The party has just begun!

06:25.436 --> 06:28.645
Aah! My beautiful,
beautiful box!

06:28.722 --> 06:31.217
<i>Say whaaat?</i>

06:31.294 --> 06:32.606
What a trick!

06:32.683 --> 06:35.679
Oh, no, no, no!
Maybe I can fix it!

06:36.036 --> 06:38.093
I don't think
that was the trick.

06:40.318 --> 06:42.510
Hang on. Our dear
old Uncle Scrooge

06:42.587 --> 06:45.023
would never go anywhere
without...

06:45.100 --> 06:46.866
his precious wallet!

06:47.724 --> 06:49.398
Scrooge isn't just gone,

06:49.475 --> 06:51.351
he's gone missing!

06:55.193 --> 06:58.046
Take that thing off!
Our uncle has been captured!

07:00.982 --> 07:04.538
Aha!
Just as I suspected!

07:05.021 --> 07:06.483
We're locked in!

07:06.560 --> 07:10.069
That means the kidnapper
is still in this very room.

07:10.146 --> 07:13.382
Clear the party schedule.
Things just got interesting!

07:13.494 --> 07:17.113
- Ahem. Hubert, a word.
- What are you doing?

07:17.190 --> 07:19.254
This isn't the time
for some dumb party game.

07:19.331 --> 07:23.145
You're right. It's time
for the <i> ultimate</i> party game,

07:23.222 --> 07:25.406
a locked room mystery party!

07:25.483 --> 07:27.343
And the stakes
couldn't be higher.

07:27.466 --> 07:29.252
- Uncle Scrooge's love of parties...
- Uncle Scrooge's life...

07:29.329 --> 07:30.413
Wait, what did you say?

07:30.490 --> 07:32.275
We gotta solve the mystery
and find Scrooge

07:32.352 --> 07:34.199
so he can experience
the true joy

07:34.276 --> 07:35.908
of a flawless birthday party.

07:35.985 --> 07:38.881
And, you know,
not possibly die?

07:38.958 --> 07:40.739
Yes, of course, and that,

07:40.816 --> 07:43.756
but if we succeed
and have a good time doing it,

07:43.833 --> 07:45.168
Scrooge may have experienced

07:45.245 --> 07:47.492
the most amazing party
of all time!

07:47.615 --> 07:49.496
Shouldn't we call somebody?

07:49.573 --> 07:53.593
But who can you call
when everyone is a suspect?

07:53.693 --> 07:56.137
Come on, boys,
the party game is afoot!

07:56.214 --> 07:58.244
Oh, I hate this already.

07:58.357 --> 08:00.059
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

08:00.136 --> 08:01.736
You can't get
that helmet off, can you?

08:02.052 --> 08:04.014
<i>Oh, no.</i>

08:04.091 --> 08:07.356
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are no longer guests.

08:07.433 --> 08:09.499
You are now suspects

08:09.576 --> 08:11.525
in the disappearance
of Scrooge McDuck.

08:11.602 --> 08:13.973
How fitting,
since our prime suspect

08:14.050 --> 08:16.937
is a master
of making things disappear.

08:17.016 --> 08:19.085
Nik Nokturne?

08:19.654 --> 08:21.302
Hmm?

08:21.740 --> 08:23.351
You accuse me?

08:23.779 --> 08:28.116
I'm merely a messenger
of the Dark Arts.

08:28.193 --> 08:29.387
Who had the motive?

08:29.464 --> 08:30.887
Scrooge was making fun of you.

08:30.964 --> 08:32.030
And the means.

08:32.107 --> 08:33.509
That dumb box thingy?

08:33.586 --> 08:35.643
Nik Nokturne is a professional.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.557
I can handle a little heckling.

08:37.719 --> 08:39.196
Is that so?

08:39.436 --> 08:41.549
Couldn't hack it
as a birthday clown, huh?

08:41.626 --> 08:43.458
Ooh, nice hood, hood guy!

08:43.535 --> 08:45.216
Hey, why don't you make
like anyone's interested

08:45.293 --> 08:47.130
- in you and disappear?
- Is this your card?

08:47.207 --> 08:49.357
- Is this your card?
- Is this your card?

08:49.434 --> 08:51.508
Whoa! Aah! Ohh...

08:52.248 --> 08:53.849
Beagle Boy!

08:53.926 --> 08:56.693
And where there's a Beagle Boy,
there must be...

08:56.770 --> 08:58.250
Ma!!!

08:58.327 --> 09:00.391
Oh, for crying out loud!

09:01.320 --> 09:02.985
Ma Beagle!

09:03.062 --> 09:04.052
<i>Gasp!</i>

09:04.129 --> 09:06.794
I always gotta do
everything myself!

09:06.871 --> 09:08.483
Rwarrr!

09:09.405 --> 09:11.919
- Rwarrr!
- I can't believe

09:11.996 --> 09:14.094
I'm stuck in here
with you morons!

09:15.295 --> 09:17.117
That's right, fools.

09:17.194 --> 09:19.657
Nik Nokturne was really me,

09:19.734 --> 09:22.430
Black Arts Beagle!

09:22.910 --> 09:25.334
This was all part
of our sinister plan.

09:25.411 --> 09:29.838
Together, we would pull off
the greatest illusion of all!

09:29.915 --> 09:31.321
Shut it, Black Arts.

09:31.546 --> 09:33.284
I would bewilder
you mere mortals

09:33.361 --> 09:35.243
with my mystical powers.

09:35.936 --> 09:37.480
Shut it, Black Arts.

09:37.557 --> 09:40.224
But it would all be
a distraction.

09:40.301 --> 09:41.342
Pow!

09:41.410 --> 09:43.566
Stop explaining
the plan, Black Arts!

09:43.643 --> 09:46.870
Of course! While he
made our uncle disappear,

09:46.947 --> 09:49.640
Ma would sneak away
to rob Scrooge!

09:49.717 --> 09:51.498
But rob him of what, you ask?

09:51.575 --> 09:52.642
He didn't ask!

09:52.719 --> 09:55.055
The deed to Duckburg!

09:56.124 --> 09:58.282
Uncle Scrooge owns the town?!

09:58.359 --> 09:59.855
Technically, he owns
the land and leases it

09:59.932 --> 10:01.216
to the town for a tidy profit.

10:01.293 --> 10:02.654
Oh, he's the best!

10:02.731 --> 10:03.803
He's a thief!

10:03.871 --> 10:05.475
Scrooge conned the deed away

10:05.552 --> 10:08.025
from my poor, defenseless
Grandpappy Beagle,

10:08.102 --> 10:09.858
who had the good sense
to steal it away

10:09.935 --> 10:11.835
from the dumb people
of Duckburg first!

10:11.912 --> 10:16.244
Ma Beagle, I accuse you
of abducting Scrooge McDuck,

10:16.321 --> 10:18.252
and breaking and entering!

10:18.351 --> 10:19.856
Breaking and entering?

10:19.933 --> 10:22.148
Why, I was invited
to this party!

10:22.225 --> 10:23.565
You invited Ma Beagle?

10:23.642 --> 10:26.184
What? She's a powerful,
totally legit businesswoman!

10:26.261 --> 10:27.943
She held us hostage
two months ago!

10:28.020 --> 10:30.827
You gave me one hour to put
together a guest list!

10:30.904 --> 10:32.639
Why would I abduct Scrooge?

10:32.716 --> 10:34.298
He's more trouble
than he's worth.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.895
I was counting
on Black Arts for a distraction,

10:36.972 --> 10:38.803
<i>but, of course,
he messed that up.</i>

10:39.067 --> 10:40.353
<i>So when the lights when out,</i>

10:40.430 --> 10:41.636
<i>I went to grab the deed</i>

10:41.713 --> 10:43.530
<i>while you dingbats
weren't looking.</i>

10:43.607 --> 10:46.526
<i>Unfortunately, someone
locked the stinkin' doors.</i>

10:46.603 --> 10:47.667
I didn't think this dummy

10:47.744 --> 10:49.364
would actually make
Scrooge disappear.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.503
I'm not a dummy.

10:50.580 --> 10:52.530
I'm the Master of the Arcane!

10:52.618 --> 10:54.605
Ah, yes, the blackout!

10:54.682 --> 10:56.415
The chandelier
mysteriously went out.

10:56.492 --> 11:00.405
But if we follow the power
supply for the chandelier to...

11:00.708 --> 11:01.833
Ha!

11:02.784 --> 11:05.501
A stupid painting.
Can I go now?

11:05.578 --> 11:10.714
Stupid painting
or elaborate security system?

11:10.791 --> 11:13.021
Top that, former
Best Party Planner.

11:13.110 --> 11:16.225
Boy, howdy, that's a DT-87,

11:16.302 --> 11:18.637
toughest security system
out there.

11:18.714 --> 11:20.433
It would take
some kind of tech genius

11:20.510 --> 11:22.436
to hack it
and turn out the lights.

11:23.903 --> 11:26.243
Someone has been live-posting
about the party!

11:26.606 --> 11:28.819
From inside the room?!

11:32.239 --> 11:33.472
Mark Beaks!

11:33.549 --> 11:35.576
What up, playa?!

11:36.563 --> 11:38.538
Yo, Mama, up top!

11:39.630 --> 11:40.826
Who is this?

11:40.903 --> 11:43.715
You were dying
to take Scrooge down!

11:43.792 --> 11:46.232
Okay, listen... Hat.

11:46.309 --> 11:48.074
I'm not threatened
by Scrooge's money.

11:48.151 --> 11:51.771
Please, cash is dead!
The new currency is buzz.

11:51.848 --> 11:53.676
So when I got
the invitation to this party...

11:53.753 --> 11:54.847
You invited him, too?

11:54.924 --> 11:57.123
One hour to prepare!
One!

11:57.200 --> 11:58.893
I saw my shot!

11:58.970 --> 12:01.151
I wasn't trying
to hack the lights, dummy!

12:01.228 --> 12:03.896
I wanted to hack
the security cameras!

12:03.973 --> 12:07.042
To erase all evidence
of Scrooge's disappearance!

12:07.119 --> 12:08.567
Erase? Uh, no, no.

12:08.644 --> 12:11.279
I was looking for footage
like, huh-this.

12:18.918 --> 12:21.950
He thought the door was open!
But it was closed!

12:22.027 --> 12:25.628
Oh, man! I am gonna post
this jam all over the interwebs!

12:25.705 --> 12:27.205
Oh, Scrooge'll look dumb

12:27.282 --> 12:29.886
while my account gets
a dumb amount of views!

12:29.963 --> 12:32.217
Kaboom! Beaks out.

12:34.909 --> 12:36.686
Heh, forgot that was locked.

12:36.763 --> 12:38.700
Hey, nobody filmed that,
did they?

12:38.777 --> 12:41.794
Now, seriously, how is this guy
one of Scrooge's nemeses?

12:41.871 --> 12:43.592
Well, that explains
the blackout,

12:43.669 --> 12:45.628
and the flash
was from Beaks's selfie!

12:45.705 --> 12:47.276
Let me see that picture again.

12:47.353 --> 12:50.951
Enhance. Enhance.

12:51.902 --> 12:53.232
There we go!

12:53.355 --> 12:58.646
Behold, my Abyss Box,
may it rest in pieces.

12:58.910 --> 13:02.201
Someone opened it the moment
before Scrooge disappeared!

13:02.278 --> 13:05.489
Someone who hates Scrooge
more than anyone.

13:05.613 --> 13:07.628
Flintheart Glomgold!

13:07.705 --> 13:10.058
Hey, my rich brother
from another mother!

13:10.135 --> 13:12.294
Well, how did you
know it was me?

13:12.371 --> 13:13.504
It's always you.

13:13.581 --> 13:15.748
And it always will be!

13:19.841 --> 13:22.010
So <i> you</i> took Scrooge!

13:22.087 --> 13:25.331
Took Scrooge? No, I was trying
to <i> kill</i> Scrooge!

13:25.408 --> 13:26.641
That's like my whole thing.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.487
FYI, you're terrible
at your thing.

13:28.564 --> 13:29.870
If he were ever gonna do it,

13:29.947 --> 13:31.583
he'd have to do it
while Beakley's gone.

13:31.660 --> 13:32.983
Ugh, I hate that woman!

13:33.060 --> 13:35.055
Me, too.
She's the absolute worst.

13:35.132 --> 13:36.690
You know who I miss?

13:36.767 --> 13:37.901
Duckworth!

13:37.978 --> 13:39.993
Aw, he threw the best parties!

13:40.070 --> 13:41.948
Ooh, that man was an artist.

13:42.025 --> 13:43.869
He <i> never</i> would've
let us in here!

13:43.946 --> 13:45.992
Nemeses memories!

13:46.069 --> 13:48.064
Stop bonding!
This is a crime scene!

13:48.141 --> 13:52.762
Anyway, when I received a literal
invitation to kill Scrooge...

13:53.870 --> 13:56.329
You know what? Next time,
you make the guest list.

13:56.406 --> 14:00.801
The real question was how
to dispose of dear old McDuck.

14:03.963 --> 14:05.345
Aah!

14:06.431 --> 14:08.916
Hah! Aah!

14:13.064 --> 14:15.422
Aah! Aah! Aah!

14:15.499 --> 14:17.310
And eventually
I ran out of time,

14:17.387 --> 14:19.257
shoved a spare bomb
in a gift box,

14:19.334 --> 14:20.990
and ran over. Ha!

14:21.092 --> 14:23.501
Oh, classic Glomgold.

14:23.842 --> 14:25.066
So when the lights went out,

14:25.143 --> 14:26.628
you rushed to give
Scrooge the gift

14:26.705 --> 14:28.402
so you wouldn't miss
your chance,

14:28.479 --> 14:30.476
but he had already disappeared.

14:30.553 --> 14:33.368
Cool, cool, cool, but so then
where's the exploding present?

14:36.202 --> 14:37.766
Not my best work.

14:37.967 --> 14:40.047
Yes, of course!

14:40.124 --> 14:42.110
It's all coming together.

14:42.225 --> 14:44.040
Staff meeting!

14:44.741 --> 14:46.839
- You got nothing, do ya?
- I got nothing.

14:46.916 --> 14:48.662
Okay, it pains me to say this,

14:48.739 --> 14:51.331
but... maybe we should call
Beakley for help.

14:51.408 --> 14:53.784
Oh, ow! Ugh.
Doing the right thing stings.

14:53.861 --> 14:56.446
No! The plan is I solve the
mystery and rescue Scrooge.

14:56.523 --> 14:58.227
He'll love the party
and he'll be forced to admit

14:58.304 --> 14:59.953
<i>I</i> did a better job
than Duckworth,

15:00.030 --> 15:02.041
and then he'll let us throw
him parties all the time!

15:02.118 --> 15:04.308
You wanna do <i> this</i> all the time?!

15:04.385 --> 15:06.183
I totally know who did it.

15:06.463 --> 15:08.917
- Ugh...
- Yes!

15:08.994 --> 15:11.870
Invited guests,
assorted archenemies,

15:11.947 --> 15:15.769
who is guilty of Scrooge
McDuck's birthday disappearance?

15:15.846 --> 15:19.368
Ironically, it was the one
with no plan whatsoever,

15:19.445 --> 15:21.298
the one who took
advantage of the chaos

15:21.375 --> 15:22.585
to take Scrooge now,

15:22.662 --> 15:25.462
then decide
how to kill him later!

15:25.539 --> 15:29.063
That's right,
it was Flintheart Glomgold!

15:29.140 --> 15:31.565
Ha ha! Wait, what?

15:31.642 --> 15:33.204
You thought
you got away with it,

15:33.281 --> 15:35.163
but you didn't count on
the World's Greatest

15:35.240 --> 15:38.894
Party Planner/Detective!
Take that, Duckworth!

15:41.557 --> 15:43.184
Try Again.

15:43.261 --> 15:45.542
<i>Bless b-bless,
bless me bagpipes.</i>

15:45.619 --> 15:47.378
Okay, so it wasn't Glomgold.

15:47.455 --> 15:50.308
That means it was... Mark Beaks!

15:50.385 --> 15:51.603
- What's up?
- Zip!

15:53.080 --> 15:55.068
Try again? Ma Beagle?

15:55.145 --> 15:58.252
Aah... Oh, come on!

15:58.329 --> 15:59.526
That's weird!

15:59.603 --> 16:01.974
There's literally
no one else it could be!

16:04.357 --> 16:06.646
If it wasn't them, then who?

16:11.391 --> 16:13.465
Cool, cool, so time to give up

16:13.542 --> 16:16.401
on this disaster of a party
and call Beakley.

16:17.021 --> 16:18.541
<i>Chip-chip-cheerio.</i>

16:18.618 --> 16:19.900
Runnin' out of sound effects?

16:19.977 --> 16:21.885
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

16:21.962 --> 16:23.958
Of course you two
want to give up!

16:24.035 --> 16:27.748
You've been conspiring against
my amazing party from the start!

16:27.825 --> 16:30.617
Inviting villains,
being bad at DJ'ing...

16:30.694 --> 16:32.565
Yeah, I said it!

16:33.407 --> 16:36.492
I wouldn't be surprised
if you took Uncle Scrooge

16:36.569 --> 16:38.417
to make me look bad!

16:38.501 --> 16:41.078
We worked our butts off
to help you plan this party,

16:41.155 --> 16:42.289
and you complained!

16:42.366 --> 16:43.834
Then we went along
with this weird

16:43.911 --> 16:46.639
mystery party idea,
which went nowhere!

16:46.716 --> 16:49.540
And worse of all,
you made me the responsible one!

16:49.617 --> 16:52.136
- Well, you can just...
- Black Arts!

16:53.821 --> 16:54.976
Black Arts!

16:55.053 --> 16:57.464
It was Black Arts Beagle
and a demon!

16:57.541 --> 16:59.144
Knew it the whole time!

16:59.229 --> 17:00.930
Great! Mystery solved. Now what?

17:01.007 --> 17:02.678
I don't know.
Once you solve the mystery,

17:02.755 --> 17:04.377
the party should be over.

17:05.315 --> 17:08.151
This party's just
getting started.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.300
I plotted this whole thing
to prove to Ma

17:10.377 --> 17:13.990
that all those magic classes were
not a waste of time. You hear me?!

17:14.067 --> 17:16.787
I summoned a demon
to get rid of her enemies,

17:16.864 --> 17:20.031
and then her,
and now I'll finally

17:20.108 --> 17:21.848
get rid of you!

17:21.925 --> 17:25.955
Spirit, I command thee
to get them!

17:28.185 --> 17:30.506
I said get them!

17:32.267 --> 17:33.532
Please?

17:33.988 --> 17:37.347
Oh, no! I'm not as good
as I thought I was!

17:39.227 --> 17:40.712
Aah!

17:40.833 --> 17:42.452
Now I'll never be able
to throw a party

17:42.529 --> 17:43.599
better than Duckworth!

17:43.676 --> 17:45.222
Also, you'll be dead.

18:02.543 --> 18:04.180
I should've listened
to Uncle Scrooge

18:04.257 --> 18:08.138
when he said, "Spit on me spats,
I hate parties,"

18:08.215 --> 18:10.021
but I just had to do it.

18:10.098 --> 18:12.981
And right now
you have to stop talking.

18:13.058 --> 18:14.618
I was trying to throw
the best party,

18:14.695 --> 18:16.873
but wound up
with the worst party!

18:17.026 --> 18:21.823
Or... was it the best party
for someone who hates parties?

18:21.900 --> 18:23.105
That's it!

18:23.548 --> 18:25.276
- Wha-oh.
- I know where Scrooge is!

18:25.353 --> 18:26.927
Stop yelling!

18:34.058 --> 18:38.020
Ah! Oh, man. I never want
to see that helmet again.

18:38.097 --> 18:40.583
Aah! I wish
I had the helmet! Duck!

18:40.824 --> 18:41.977
Turn right.

18:42.551 --> 18:44.329
I said right. Louie, right!

18:44.406 --> 18:48.529
I'm not controlling the armor.
The ghost thing is!

18:48.606 --> 18:50.066
Whoa!

18:55.433 --> 18:58.193
Come on! I know exactly
who's behind this.

18:59.433 --> 19:03.084
Boys, I give you the man
who kidnapped our Uncle Scrooge.

19:04.121 --> 19:05.638
Uncle Scrooge?!

19:07.608 --> 19:09.533
There you lads are!

19:09.610 --> 19:11.888
You're just in time
for the best part!

19:15.097 --> 19:16.545
<i>Aah!</i>

19:17.449 --> 19:19.427
<i>- Whoo-ooh-ooh-hoo!
- Ughh!</i>

19:19.997 --> 19:21.393
<i>Don't kill me! I barely lived!</i>

19:21.470 --> 19:24.302
<i>♪ YOLO ♪FOMO ♪Aaah!</i>

19:25.355 --> 19:26.886
The person with the best reason

19:26.963 --> 19:30.208
for getting Scrooge out of
the party was Scrooge himself!

19:30.441 --> 19:32.779
S-S-S-Say whaaat?

19:33.215 --> 19:35.026
Sorry, I'm not used to talking.

19:35.103 --> 19:37.744
Sound effect.
Beep-beep-boop-mep!

19:37.821 --> 19:39.783
Wait, what about
Black Art's ghost?

19:39.860 --> 19:43.474
Not his ghost, my ghost!

19:47.847 --> 19:50.209
Boys, meet Duckworth.

19:51.043 --> 19:53.193
Good evening, young sirs.

19:53.542 --> 19:55.489
A ghost butler?!

19:55.566 --> 19:57.349
So, do I ring a bell
when I need you,

19:57.426 --> 19:58.737
or you just... you just show up?

19:58.814 --> 20:02.881
It all started with that
monstrosity of a magic show.

20:02.958 --> 20:06.333
I call upon the spirits!

20:06.410 --> 20:10.581
<i>That preposterous prestidigitator
conjured up a spirit, all right.</i>

20:10.658 --> 20:12.534
<i>Unfortunately for him,</i>

20:12.611 --> 20:16.177
<i>it was the ghost
of my most loyal servant.</i>

20:20.643 --> 20:22.354
I return to the corporeal world

20:22.431 --> 20:25.276
to find the mansion full
of Mr. McDuck's enemies,

20:25.353 --> 20:27.247
and even worse, hosting them

20:27.324 --> 20:29.479
at a subpar party.

20:29.556 --> 20:30.510
Hey!

20:30.587 --> 20:33.755
So I did what any butler
worth his coattails would.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.166
Alleviate the situation.

20:36.243 --> 20:38.194
So the creepy whispering
was you?

20:38.271 --> 20:41.380
I do have a flair
for the dramatic.

20:41.462 --> 20:43.742
When the lights went out,
you took Scrooge

20:43.819 --> 20:46.880
to protect him from them...
and me.

20:46.948 --> 20:48.112
I'm sorry, Uncle Scrooge.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.633
This was supposed to be
a party for you,

20:49.701 --> 20:50.984
but I made it about me.

20:51.110 --> 20:52.465
Please accept my resignation

20:52.542 --> 20:55.476
as World's Greatest
Party Planner/Detective.

20:55.553 --> 20:56.767
Ach, rubbish!

20:56.844 --> 20:58.392
This has been
my best birthday ever!

20:58.469 --> 20:59.619
Those villains will think twice

20:59.696 --> 21:02.140
about trying to set foot
in McDuck Manor again!

21:02.217 --> 21:05.344
And you brought back
my favorite butler

21:05.421 --> 21:08.185
from beyond the grave, no less!

21:08.412 --> 21:11.252
The two of you really threw
a corker of a party!

21:11.329 --> 21:12.892
Hang on! If you liked the party,

21:12.969 --> 21:15.015
why did Duckworth scare
us all half to death?

21:15.092 --> 21:17.937
Ah, you were never
in any real danger.

21:18.014 --> 21:20.841
That was clearly
a fake ghost axe.

21:21.150 --> 21:23.158
Ahem. Of course.

21:23.235 --> 21:24.640
May this be a lesson.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.945
I never want another party.

21:28.041 --> 21:29.726
But what about parties
for holidays,

21:29.803 --> 21:31.205
like Christmas, Hanukkah,

21:31.282 --> 21:33.098
or the often-overlooked
Arbor Day?

21:33.175 --> 21:37.802
Mr. McDuck just said...
No parties!

21:39.056 --> 21:40.894
I'll just buy a card.

21:43.651 --> 21:45.396
Hey, Duckworth.

21:45.776 --> 21:47.314
Mrs. Beagley.

21:47.391 --> 21:49.156
How nice of you
to finally return

21:49.233 --> 21:51.057
after abandoning your post.

21:51.134 --> 21:54.024
Thankfully, I was here
to pick up your slack.

21:54.224 --> 21:57.819
Tell me, do you typically keep
the house this shabby?

21:57.896 --> 22:00.234
I preferred it
when you were dead.
