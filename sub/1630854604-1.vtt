00:02.698 --> 00:05.483
<i>Norway is just magical.</i>

00:05.483 --> 00:08.704
<i>This is the closest place
to heaven I've ever been.</i>

00:08.704 --> 00:12.490
<i>It's just so hard to
explain it unless you're here.</i>

00:12.490 --> 00:14.753
<i>It's the land of adventure.</i>

00:14.753 --> 00:16.755
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

00:16.755 --> 00:18.366
Oh my god.

00:19.584 --> 00:20.542
Ahh!

00:22.544 --> 00:24.241
Oh!

00:24.241 --> 00:25.764
Everyone nice and warm?

00:25.764 --> 00:28.028
What in the damn world a
Caribbean man like me doing?

00:33.642 --> 00:35.905
Casey, are you
living your best life?

00:35.905 --> 00:38.168
Best life fishing for pubes.

00:38.168 --> 00:40.214
Captain! Captain! Yeah!

00:40.214 --> 00:41.171
<i>My calling card's
rock and roll.</i>

00:41.171 --> 00:42.694
<i>Let's have fun.</i>

00:42.694 --> 00:44.522
<i>I want my crew to know
they have my support,</i>

00:44.522 --> 00:46.611
but I'm not
a helicopter dad.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.570
Do some breathing. You only
piss with the dick you've got.

00:51.616 --> 00:54.271
<i>We are stewardesses
on a five-star boat.</i>

00:54.271 --> 00:56.839
All I care about is being
a great chief stew.

00:56.839 --> 01:00.364
Make sure everything
is perfect.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.149
Ah!

01:03.585 --> 01:06.109
This is A game,
so everyone needs to activate,

01:06.109 --> 01:07.719
to elevate, and to focus.

01:07.719 --> 01:10.157
It's like
an orgasm in my mouth.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.941
It's Viking, bitches.

01:11.941 --> 01:14.117
<i>I hope to be the kind
of leader that people like</i>

01:14.117 --> 01:16.859
<i>and keep everyone happy.</i>

01:16.859 --> 01:18.861
<i>I'm not going to
kiss and tell about Oriana.</i>

01:18.861 --> 01:21.037
Let's just say there's things
going on under the bubbles

01:21.037 --> 01:22.125
that people can't see.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.300
Oh my gosh.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.694
This is where we
hot tub and have sex?

01:27.304 --> 01:28.610
<i>I love tall guys.</i>

01:28.610 --> 01:30.264
You scared me.

01:30.264 --> 01:34.355
The bigger the boat, the more
staff you have, shall we say.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.008
You two are smoking hot.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.575
<i>I do have to say, when
you're more flexible,</i>

01:37.575 --> 01:39.751
it's way easier having
sex in bunk beds.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.884
Any opportunity I can get,
I want

01:41.884 --> 01:43.277
to have my legs in the air.

01:43.277 --> 01:44.582
Nice one.

01:44.582 --> 01:45.714
Boom. Boom. Oh!

01:45.714 --> 01:47.063
Oh, wow.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.325
What is your diet?

01:48.325 --> 01:49.761
Glazed donuts and Oreos.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.241
There's vomit
all over these sheets.

01:51.241 --> 01:52.329
Oh, it smells like pizza.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.330
I'm going to be sick.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.723
We better get a good tip.

01:54.723 --> 01:55.898
I wonder else
what could go wrong.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.508
You're stressing
me the out.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.554
She went behind
my back to Lewis.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.556
I just can't stand it,
your arrogance.

02:01.556 --> 02:04.036
<i>If we told the
captain what you did,</i>

02:04.036 --> 02:05.299
you wouldn't get a reference.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.996
She walked into
there with an attitude.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.215
Only one of us
has an attitude.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.433
- Who's that?
- You.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.869
The girl's got
brass balls.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.612
It's like amateur hour.

02:14.612 --> 02:15.918
For a straight hour
there was no deck crew.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.267
Or hit somebody,
who's in the ?

02:17.267 --> 02:18.355
I am.
- You need to focus.

02:18.355 --> 02:19.791
Use your words.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.097
<i>People are scared
of you on the galley.</i>

02:21.097 --> 02:22.533
It's borderline intimidation.

02:22.533 --> 02:23.752
OK.

02:23.752 --> 02:24.796
I won't allow
intimidation on the boat.

02:24.796 --> 02:27.016
This is not
where I need to be.

02:56.828 --> 02:59.091
All crew, all crew,
meeting on the fly bridge.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.311
It might be a bit chilly
upstairs, so bring a jumper.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.312
Booyah.

03:07.317 --> 03:09.406
It's cold.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.019
Howdy. Howdy.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.720
Good day, team.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.592
Welcome aboard the "Mercury,"
and welcome to Norway.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.638
The big thing for us,
guys, is to remember,

03:23.638 --> 03:25.074
right, we are on cold water.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.555
We're not in the Bahamas
or somewhere nice and balmy.

03:27.555 --> 03:30.166
For me, I love the
adventure of being

03:30.166 --> 03:34.562
in cold water, where the
weather can turn very quickly.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.955
So when we're doing transfers
from the back of the boat

03:36.955 --> 03:39.741
onto tenders and so forth,
just take our time with it.

03:39.741 --> 03:43.048
Passengers are going to be
wearing a lot of clothing.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.050
OK. They go into the water,
they're going to sink.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.530
I know we're all going
to have some long nights

03:46.530 --> 03:48.097
and early mornings.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.708
Heads of department, you need
to take care of your crew.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.580
<i>I've been a captain
for over 20 years.</i>

03:52.580 --> 03:55.583
I grew up in a very macho world
in the outback in Australia.

03:55.583 --> 03:59.587
Here in Norway, cold water
provides more excitement,

03:59.587 --> 04:01.893
<i>and in our vicinity
is a lot more adventure.</i>

04:01.893 --> 04:03.460
You know, guys, there's
plenty of different things

04:03.460 --> 04:05.201
we can do here.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.463
<i>The yachting level of service
doesn't stop once the guests</i>

04:06.463 --> 04:07.812
<i>leave the vessel.</i>

04:07.812 --> 04:10.119
Our job is to give the
guests the adventure

04:10.119 --> 04:11.425
of their lifetime.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.905
The way I run a vessel is,
I'm firm but fair.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.907
I know people tend
to push boundaries,

04:15.907 --> 04:17.866
but if you push them too
far, you'll know about it.

04:17.866 --> 04:20.390
I usually set my own
rules, because I'm a cowboy.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.957
I mean, I've got it right here.

04:21.957 --> 04:25.787
Cowboy, so I'm just a roughneck
that gets it out the mud.

04:25.787 --> 04:29.007
<i>And I've done this for
4 and 1/2 years now,</i>

04:29.007 --> 04:32.576
and I've learned how to
not take no for an answer.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.143
You guys can
back to your duties,

04:34.143 --> 04:35.100
get the boat ready.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.101
Thank you, guys.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.277
Let's go to work.

04:42.238 --> 04:45.067
Oh my gosh.

04:45.067 --> 04:47.156
I love the
smell of cocoa butter.

04:47.156 --> 04:49.332
Oh, man, I love cocoa butter.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.464
You stay on
that cocoa butter.

04:50.464 --> 04:51.508
Yes.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.162
Let her rip, tater chip.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.468
I would split up.

04:54.468 --> 04:55.773
One go in one room,
one go in another.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.122
Got it.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.863
Vacuum and start getting
rooms looking good.

04:58.863 --> 04:59.995
For sure.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.779
I just don't know
anyone that would

05:01.779 --> 05:04.260
leave a boat in this state.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.349
This is a show.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.350
Have you been doing yachts
for a while?

05:07.350 --> 05:08.482
Yeah, five years.

05:08.482 --> 05:09.439
This is my first
yacht actually.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.397
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.615
Damn.

05:11.615 --> 05:12.877
This is going to
be a crazy journey.

05:12.877 --> 05:13.965
Yeah, I know.

05:17.055 --> 05:17.969
A white boat?

05:17.969 --> 05:19.493
Is that a fancy term for yacht?

05:19.493 --> 05:21.799
I don't know any of that
frilly terminology.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.018
- You worked on yachts before?
- No.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.149
OK.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.325
I worked on commercial ships.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.891
So you're a yacht greeny.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.893
<i>I went to school at the
New York Maritime Academy,</i>

05:28.893 --> 05:31.722
so when I graduated, I started
sailing on commercial vessels.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.245
<i>So I do have some
decent experience.</i>

05:33.245 --> 05:34.246
<i>I can do big ships.</i>

05:34.246 --> 05:35.857
Why can't I do little ones?

05:35.857 --> 05:37.772
I'll tell you what,
let's use the dirty chamois

05:37.772 --> 05:39.556
for all the scuppers,
all the drains,

05:39.556 --> 05:41.123
every drain needs wiping over.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.167
All right.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.995
I cannot function like this.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.170
There's food in the sink.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.607
This is gross.

05:46.607 --> 05:49.479
What the hell does
this even mean?

05:49.479 --> 05:50.654
My grandmother was
Spanish-Italian,

05:50.654 --> 05:52.917
so I grew up with
food around me.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.226
Just hanging out
in the kitchen.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.923
It was my happy place.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.103
I often get teased,
especially on Instagram,

06:05.103 --> 06:06.844
<i>because I'm
the Wanderlust chick.</i>

06:06.844 --> 06:08.846
<i>And people are like, ooh,
wanderlust, blah blah blah.</i>

06:08.846 --> 06:10.718
<i>But this describes
me perfectly.</i>

06:10.718 --> 06:12.372
<i>Well-suited to yachting and
to being a chef,</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:13.808
<i>because no day is the same.</i>

06:13.808 --> 06:15.462
Being exposed to
different places,

06:15.462 --> 06:17.464
that brings me inspiration.

06:17.464 --> 06:20.031
Oh my god,
I could actually cry.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.076
Hey.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.077
Howdy. Howdy.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.040
Oriana, Kasie, can you
meet me in the main salon?

06:29.040 --> 06:30.694
Copy. Thanks.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.783
<i>I've been a chief stew
for nearly two years now.</i>

06:32.783 --> 06:34.655
I grew up in Southeast London.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.613
<i>I went to an all-girls school.</i>

06:36.613 --> 06:39.224
Southeast London girls
do our hair and makeup.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.704
We like our nails done.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.402
<i>You don't mess with us.</i>

06:42.402 --> 06:44.186
We can have a fight.

06:44.186 --> 06:48.451
I can't wait to just crack on
and get this boat going.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.714
So I think the first
day of charter,

06:50.714 --> 06:57.025
we do 150% makeup,
hair, uniform, everything.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.853
We're just going
to be the best.

06:58.853 --> 06:59.854
Yeah?

06:59.854 --> 07:01.377
Got it.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.732
Mike, which way
did you curl the hose?

07:08.732 --> 07:09.864
I don't know, you
kind of just whatever

07:09.864 --> 07:11.213
the hose wants to do
is what you do.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.475
Oh, yeah, dude, that's
a hell of a rule, dude.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.129
Tell him that.
- Anti-clockwise.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.130
No way.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.436
I've never done
that in my life.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.481
I always go this way,
right over.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.482
Like that.
That's clockwise.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.918
That is clockwise.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.267
I don't know why I
said anticlockwise.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.268
Which way is it?

07:23.268 --> 07:24.400
Clockwise or counterclockwise?

07:24.400 --> 07:25.488
I'm wrong.
It's clockwise.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.403
It's clockwise. Yeah.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.666
It's always exciting meeting
a complete new boat full

07:29.666 --> 07:31.059
of people, new characters.

07:31.059 --> 07:33.583
I did do clockwise
but said anticlockwise.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.237
I grew up on a farm
in northern England.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.195
<i>It was mainly a horse
farm, but we used to rescue</i>

07:37.195 --> 07:38.675
<i>animals all the time.</i>

07:38.675 --> 07:40.111
<i>We used to have them
running around the kitchen.</i>

07:40.111 --> 07:43.201
<i>Like my parents, I'm also
a bit of a workaholic.</i>

07:43.201 --> 07:45.073
<i>You know, I've been
in yachting five years.</i>

07:45.073 --> 07:47.467
<i>I worked on the same vessel,
moved my way up from deckhand</i>

07:47.467 --> 07:48.816
<i>to first officer.</i>

07:48.816 --> 07:50.513
The boat I was on, I would
have stayed on longer,

07:50.513 --> 07:51.949
<i>but the owner sold the boat.</i>

07:51.949 --> 07:54.212
It felt like a break up with
the only woman currently

07:54.212 --> 07:56.040
in my life, the boat.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.912
I was just going to
throw you guys off.

07:57.912 --> 07:58.913
Clockwise?

07:58.913 --> 08:01.045
Yeah.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.525
Obviously,
I've seen your CVs,

08:02.525 --> 08:04.527
so if you want to tell me
what you like,

08:04.527 --> 08:06.050
what you're confident in.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.923
Experience wise, I'm very
confident in housekeeping...

08:08.923 --> 08:10.011
- OK.
- And service.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.708
I haven't done
a lot of mixology,

08:11.708 --> 08:13.101
but I'd be happy to learn.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.537
- OK.
- So...

08:14.537 --> 08:16.234
I started in the industry
about 3 and 1/2 years ago.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.497
That was my first boat.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.628
I worked with Oriana.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.282
She was my chief stew.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.936
Oh my god.

08:21.936 --> 08:24.591
How's it going.

08:24.591 --> 08:25.983
That's so crazy.

08:25.983 --> 08:28.116
I was like, I definitely
recognize this girl.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.119
Yeah.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.555
- Small world.
- Small world.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.514
When Oriana and
I worked together,

08:34.514 --> 08:39.040
I was totally green, so I was
just ready for some direction.

08:39.040 --> 08:43.087
Kasie is not someone who
likes to be told what to do.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.786
Oriana was a
controlling chief stew.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.352
I wouldn't say I'm
a controlling person.

08:47.352 --> 08:50.573
She just is, like,
high-strung and very stressed.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.575
I think I'm the
chilliest worker there is.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.012
I don't think--there's nothing
wrong with being chill.

08:55.012 --> 08:57.145
I don't really respect her.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.712
So I already know I'm
really excited to work

08:58.712 --> 09:00.583
with you again.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.063
- OK,
- Other things I'd like

09:02.063 --> 09:04.500
to talk about.
I have a list.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.067
One thing that
gets me frazzled is

09:06.067 --> 09:07.634
when I don't know, like,
the full plan for something.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.331
Yep, absolutely.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.724
Great.

09:10.724 --> 09:11.942
Another thing is, like,
just clear communication.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.030
Sorry.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.336
I'm not as strong in laundry.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.380
I'd love to learn about that.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.687
Next, da da da.

09:17.687 --> 09:20.037
I see us as equals.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.473
- That's how I like to--
- I'd just love to, you know...

09:21.473 --> 09:24.172
- Yep.
- Figure that out.

09:24.172 --> 09:27.305
<i>I mean, I can tell instantly
that Oriana is looking forward</i>

09:27.305 --> 09:28.829
to being that second stew.

09:28.829 --> 09:31.396
But it's up to me to put
them in the positions

09:31.396 --> 09:32.920
I feel they belong in.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.748
I rarely have
conflicts on boats,

09:34.748 --> 09:36.924
but I know that charter
is high-stress,

09:36.924 --> 09:38.055
and that might happen.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.143
So I'd love to talk about that.

09:39.143 --> 09:40.449
Yeah.

09:40.449 --> 09:41.668
I have no problem with
addressing other people.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.191
Absolutely not.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.367
Until then, no one's going
to be a second or a third.

09:45.367 --> 09:48.413
But I think we all know
who the chief stew is.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.244
<i>Coming up...</i>

09:53.244 --> 09:55.246
I'll leave it up to Lewis to
choose which deckhand to come

09:55.246 --> 09:58.032
with you to the pickup.

09:58.032 --> 10:00.121
What?

10:09.565 --> 10:11.611
All right, so the plan is
let's go down deck by deck

10:11.611 --> 10:13.482
and get all the
cushions out, and then

10:13.482 --> 10:15.658
hopefully we'll be a bit
more prepared for tomorrow.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.225
Ladies, how are we?

10:17.225 --> 10:18.530
We've been trying
to pull everything out.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.184
We're just doing
like mirror checks.

10:20.184 --> 10:23.710
Sorry, I hate it when
you can see dust down here.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.494
I think we should look
at it from the perspective

10:25.494 --> 10:28.976
of whatever a guest will
bitch about, we clean.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.238
<i>I grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts,</i>

10:30.238 --> 10:31.543
and I felt a lot of
pressure growing up

10:31.543 --> 10:33.241
being the child of two
people who were very

10:33.241 --> 10:34.764
accomplished in their fields.

10:34.764 --> 10:38.681
My mom was a photojournalist,
and my dad is a scientist.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.640
I'm going to set that
for the engineers.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.337
Since I was in middle school,
I've struggled,

10:42.337 --> 10:43.730
because I've been dyslexic.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.296
<i>My parents were always
really supportive of me,</i>

10:45.296 --> 10:47.168
<i>but I was kind of just like
mad at myself,</i>

10:47.168 --> 10:50.475
because I want to do well
in life.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.739
<i>And I've always felt like
I've had something to prove.</i>

10:52.739 --> 10:53.957
Let's triple check--

10:53.957 --> 10:55.524
- Everything.
- Yeah.

10:55.524 --> 10:58.440
So I have to overcompensate,
which I guess comes out

10:58.440 --> 11:00.007
being more detail-oriented.
- OK.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.051
I didn't vacuum under.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.226
OK.
No worries.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.143
See if it fits.

11:11.714 --> 11:14.978
All crew, we have provisions.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.545
Roger that.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.589
It is so dirty.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.639
Where do you want
me to put the wine?

11:23.639 --> 11:24.858
That's a really good point.
What's in here?

11:24.858 --> 11:26.120
Deck stuff.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.251
It's all covers
and foul-weather gear.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.253
- OK.
- What's under here?

11:29.253 --> 11:31.255
- That's the escape hatch.
- Oh, yeah.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.735
We're getting a workout, huh?

11:32.735 --> 11:34.911
Did we find the key for
the lockers on the sun deck?

11:34.911 --> 11:36.130
Looks like a regular
just hex.

11:36.130 --> 11:40.090
The storage on
this boat is awful.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.309
Oh, we got space.

11:41.309 --> 11:42.702
Yes.

11:48.272 --> 11:51.362
Never in my life have
I ever seen storage

11:51.362 --> 11:53.974
<i>up on the stairs that
is in the crew area</i>

11:53.974 --> 11:56.541
all the way to the
bow of the boat.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.021
I mean, how am I going
to get out of here?

11:58.021 --> 11:59.675
- She's in there?
- Yeah.

11:59.675 --> 12:05.115
So going into this trip like
this is an absolute nightmare.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.464
Oh my god.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.553
Guys, this is not normal.
Whoo!

12:08.553 --> 12:10.730
Day one, acrobatics.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.517
Oh my god,
why'd I choose two?

12:15.517 --> 12:17.780
To the forward.

12:17.780 --> 12:18.999
Check us out.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.961
What are you talking about?

12:24.961 --> 12:26.528
I like them all, man.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.486
I've got a lot of sisters,
so I know how to treat them.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.662
I'm not like the
normal typical yachty,

12:30.662 --> 12:33.056
<i>because I have to provide
for my seven sisters</i>

12:33.056 --> 12:34.492
<i>and also my mom.</i>

12:34.492 --> 12:36.625
<i>I grew up in the
Bahamas most of my life.</i>

12:36.625 --> 12:38.888
We didn't have a lot.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.237
You know where I'm from, man?

12:40.237 --> 12:41.804
From the
island of the Bahamas.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.153
Caribbean, man.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.241
Where do you think you're
coming through trying

12:44.241 --> 12:46.113
to control big Caribbean man.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.897
<i>I didn't grow up
with a silver spoon.</i>

12:47.897 --> 12:49.638
I was given a plastic spoon.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.682
Can you imagine?

12:50.682 --> 12:51.814
So, you know, plastic.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.250
It's bent.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.557
I got to try to make this
sh-- work, you know?

12:55.557 --> 12:57.254
I just feel like growing
up in the Caribbean, man,

12:57.254 --> 12:58.429
must have been a blast.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.953
Yeah, it's a happy life,
you know?

13:02.259 --> 13:05.001
Jess, Faye, and
Lewis, could you please

13:05.001 --> 13:06.568
come up to the wheelhouse?

13:09.963 --> 13:12.704
All right, so this is our
first charter of the season.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.358
Looks like we got a
fine group of people.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.577
We have Rick,
his wife Sarah,

13:15.577 --> 13:18.188
celebrating their
40th birthdays.

13:18.188 --> 13:19.799
They are all best friends

13:19.799 --> 13:22.018
and love to play drinking games
and get loud.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.977
I think the most
important thing for me

13:23.977 --> 13:26.631
off the bat,
adventure requests.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.199
They want to be as
adventurous as possible.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.201
They want cave tours,
rock climbing.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.855
So, Faye,
will take care of that.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.204
OK.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.685
Norway is just the
absolute perfect location

13:36.685 --> 13:38.252
<i>for those that like
to be adventurous</i>

13:38.252 --> 13:41.429
<i>and experience things that
they've never done before,</i>

13:41.429 --> 13:46.564
<i>cold-water diving, waterfalls,
zip lining, caving.</i>

13:46.564 --> 13:49.654
It has endless adventures
and opportunity to be had.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.874
And, Lewis,
as far as transport, mate,

13:51.874 --> 13:53.180
take care of that.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.529
We need to bring the
highest level of service

13:54.529 --> 13:57.184
to everything,
including the adventures.

13:57.184 --> 13:58.228
Yeah, let's bring it.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.795
Kick it off well.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.884
<i>The guests are going to
go on this beautiful hike</i>

14:01.884 --> 14:04.365
<i>through the mountains
to the Valldal caves.</i>

14:04.365 --> 14:06.584
All along the
Norwegian fjords are

14:06.584 --> 14:08.891
caves that have been
formed from falling

14:08.891 --> 14:11.024
<i>rocks over many, many years.</i>

14:11.024 --> 14:15.593
This is an iconic experience,
and I mean, you know,

14:15.593 --> 14:18.248
we could find a dead Viking
or a sword or something

14:18.248 --> 14:19.467
down there.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.861
Jess, what's your
big stand outs?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.994
They're into their food
quite a lot, steak and seafood.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.604
Think about theme parties.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.085
<i>Looks like they
want a Viking theme.</i>

14:29.085 --> 14:30.870
So we'll kick off
with a Viking night,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.089
welcome them to
Norway the right way.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.178
I don't know about this one,
but I want to dance on tables

14:35.178 --> 14:37.311
and party 18 hours a day.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.878
18 hours a day?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.054
Cool, 'cause it only gets
dark at 10:00 at night.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.620
So we're gonna have
some long nights.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.058
This looks like an awesome
group to kick off with.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.798
Let's go.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.633
Deck crew, deck crew, deck
briefing on main deck aft.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.116
Ooh, disgusting.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.644
The way the day is
going to work tomorrow is,

15:06.644 --> 15:09.473
we're just going to wash
down all the main deck aft,

15:09.473 --> 15:10.910
spruce her up a bit.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.346
So in the morning,
we'll launch the tenders,

15:12.346 --> 15:14.478
because this gangway,
this is not really safe

15:14.478 --> 15:16.002
for guests to be coming
and going from.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.481
I'll leave it up to Lewis
to choose

15:17.481 --> 15:19.657
which deckhand to come with you
to the pickup.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.224
And then on this side,
the other two deckhands

15:21.224 --> 15:22.834
can receive the boat.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.532
<i>My father was in the
military, he was in the army,</i>

15:24.532 --> 15:27.796
so he was very much a
drill sergeant to us kids,

15:27.796 --> 15:29.537
<i>so I brought that
into yachting.</i>

15:29.537 --> 15:31.408
<i>I run an efficient,
tight ship.</i>

15:31.408 --> 15:32.844
You know,
there's a chain of command.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.672
It's the first time us
guys are working together.

15:34.672 --> 15:37.414
I like very clear
and precise and a calm

15:37.414 --> 15:38.850
manner on the radio.

15:38.850 --> 15:41.331
I am happy with being
questioned after the task

15:41.331 --> 15:42.724
<i>has been fulfilled.</i>

15:42.724 --> 15:44.334
There's always a better
way of doing something.

15:44.334 --> 15:47.598
I can't say I've thought
of every good way,

15:47.598 --> 15:49.557
but there's a good chance
I thought of most of them.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.169
All right. Any questions, guys?

15:53.169 --> 15:54.431
- No, I'm good.
- Crystal clear.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.477
Crystal clear?
All right.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.307
Eww. Oh, OK. OK. OK.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.352
I thought that that was used.

16:02.352 --> 16:03.571
I just feel really
bad for the girls.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.920
They haven't even
made the beds yet.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.400
I can help them.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.444
It's up to you.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.793
Let's make the stewards beds.

16:08.793 --> 16:09.707
Yeah.

16:09.707 --> 16:11.492
Let's do their beds for them.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.015
- You need any hands?
- Yeah.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.016
I'll help you.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.191
Amazing.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.193
Don't put me on
some though.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.499
Boy, you asked.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.675
I'm definitely
a lovable cowboy.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.938
I'm a hopeless romantic,
but I'm very single.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.461
Thank you.

16:24.461 --> 16:25.810
I just haven't got the
patience to do that right now.

16:25.810 --> 16:26.724
No problem.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.900
Faye has got a rocking body.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.598
I would like an older woman
just because they probably

16:30.598 --> 16:32.774
could teach me a few things.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.863
And buy me stuff.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.908
- Oh.
- Oh.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.171
It was there too.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.781
Oh, no.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.044
Dude, I don't even
know how this works.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.698
You've got to drop this on.

16:43.698 --> 16:44.786
Is it all the
same on all yachts?

16:44.786 --> 16:46.135
The same kind of
setup for the beds?

16:46.135 --> 16:47.441
Most of the time.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.399
I mean, look for that
thing right quickly.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.922
I just need to grab my book.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.272
I'm sorry.

16:52.272 --> 16:53.925
I really appreciate
you doing this.

16:53.925 --> 16:54.926
Yeah, you guys--

16:54.926 --> 16:55.927
No problem.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.147
Kasie, I think she's hot.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.757
She has beautiful eyes.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.107
Are you guys going to be done
with what you're doing soon?

17:01.107 --> 17:02.151
I don't think so.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.500
No?

17:03.500 --> 17:05.067
In commercial shipping,
the women being on board

17:05.067 --> 17:06.677
is pretty rare.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.853
Usually, it's like you're on
there with a bunch of guys,

17:08.853 --> 17:12.422
and you just can't wait
to get off.

17:12.422 --> 17:13.423
So sweet.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.511
Thank you, guys.

17:14.511 --> 17:15.991
That's really nice of you.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.603
- Hi.
- How's it going?

17:19.603 --> 17:20.648
Yeah.
Good.

17:20.648 --> 17:21.779
It's getting there, girls.

17:21.779 --> 17:22.954
- So you're feeling OK?
- Yeah.

17:22.954 --> 17:23.912
- Good.
- Yeah.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.044
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.437
So tomorrow,
towels are in the wash,

17:27.437 --> 17:28.612
so first thing in the morning...

17:28.612 --> 17:30.397
- Yeah.
- Just smash it out.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.312
Thank you all
for a fantastic day.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.965
- Thank you.
- Cool. Cool. Cool.

17:35.445 --> 17:36.968
How have you been?
- Good.

17:36.968 --> 17:37.969
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:37.969 --> 17:38.883
Have you been on boats?

17:38.883 --> 17:40.798
Yeah, like 3 and 1/2 years.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.452
So it's Oriana,
and what's the next one?

17:42.452 --> 17:43.975
- Kasie.
- Which one is Oriana?

17:43.975 --> 17:45.499
- Faye is the chief stew.
- So hold up.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.066
Which one is Kasie?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.023
The British-sounding one.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.068
No, she's not British.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.112
Yeah, she has an accent.

17:50.112 --> 17:53.420
When I knew you,
you had a guy.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.465
I probably had many guys.

17:55.465 --> 17:56.466
Am I making it up?

17:56.466 --> 17:57.511
That Kasie's British?

17:57.511 --> 17:58.512
Yes, you are.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.556
She's not British.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.819
Right now I'm single, yeah.

18:01.819 --> 18:02.820
Got it.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.257
How about you?

18:04.257 --> 18:05.649
- Yeah, single.
- Single.

18:05.649 --> 18:06.868
Single, Faye?
- Yeah.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.174
It's weird.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.176
I'm so single,
but I've still got man issues,

18:10.176 --> 18:11.699
and I'm like, how?

18:11.699 --> 18:12.917
Faye has a British accent.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.615
OK, yes.
But Kasie has got an accent.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.573
She has a British accent--
Australian accent.

18:16.573 --> 18:20.229
You're crazy.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.275
I forgot my makeup wipes.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.364
How annoying.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.498
- Good night.
- Good night.

18:32.502 --> 18:33.503
Oh, did I?

18:33.503 --> 18:34.504
I'm sorry about that.

18:34.504 --> 18:35.679
I won't do it again.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.420
Man, that's funny, man.

19:10.366 --> 19:11.324
Oh, yeah, dude.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.413
That's refreshing.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.591
- You all right?
- Oh, my God.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.159
Let the captain know and
maybe go lay down for a while.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.596
Last night,
we got the chicken salad,

19:22.596 --> 19:24.554
and after that,
I just kind of felt off.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.469
Well, these guys
like margaritas--

19:26.469 --> 19:27.818
Oh, perfect.

19:27.818 --> 19:29.820
So we can definitely
do a batch of margaritas.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.213
Oh.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.345
I just yacked twice.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.215
- Like throwing up?
- Yeah.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.521
Bugger.

19:34.521 --> 19:35.478
Do you want to lay down
for a little bit?

19:35.478 --> 19:36.436
- OK.
- OK, I'll check on you.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.089
- OK.
- Thank you.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.091
It's getting real.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.310
This is not good.

19:41.310 --> 19:44.226
All crew, all crew,
Oriana is not well.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.968
<i>With a stew down,
prepare for the worst.</i>

19:46.968 --> 19:48.143
<i>Coming up...</i>

19:48.143 --> 19:49.971
"Mercury" departing
Alesund harbor.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.539
Hold all fenders until
we've cleared the port.

19:52.539 --> 19:53.888
I can't see ahead of me.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.237
<i>While I'm going
through the narrowest</i>

19:55.237 --> 19:56.195
part of the channel...

20:07.380 --> 20:12.385
All crew, all crew, Oriana
is not felling very well.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.909
So I assume I'm a stew down.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.476
Kasie?

20:16.476 --> 20:17.912
Where is she now?

20:17.912 --> 20:18.739
Sick.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.219
Is Oriana upset?

20:20.219 --> 20:21.307
She's sick.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.265
She said she had something bad.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.266
<i>So the boat's not ready.</i>

20:24.266 --> 20:25.746
I've got a new crew.

20:25.746 --> 20:28.096
I've got guests coming, and
I've got members of staff

20:28.096 --> 20:29.271
<i>sick already.</i>

20:29.271 --> 20:31.317
What could go wrong?

20:31.317 --> 20:32.535
We're a stew down.

20:32.535 --> 20:35.146
I think prepare for the worst.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.062
Oh, .

20:38.062 --> 20:41.196
Mike, Nathan, I really
need you guys to power on now,

20:41.196 --> 20:43.459
because we found
ourselves in a situation

20:43.459 --> 20:46.288
where we need to start
covering for the interior,

20:46.288 --> 20:47.507
because they're a man down.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.596
Yeah, roger that.

20:51.685 --> 20:52.642
Yeah.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.688
Hey, buddy.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.211
- What?
- You better.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.387
If you don't, you better sleep
with your eyes open then.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.997
Oh, you just had to ask.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.260
Early bird gets
the worm, 'cuz.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.000
Yep.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.220
I'm going to process this as a
joke instead of a genuine act

21:05.220 --> 21:06.526
of aggression.

21:06.526 --> 21:07.875
<i>Where I come from
people just ask nicely</i>

21:07.875 --> 21:10.747
and talk about their feelings.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.360
Instead of two.
- You got a promotion already.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.885
I want to know what
the deal is for on time.

21:17.885 --> 21:19.060
What do you guys usually do?

21:19.060 --> 21:21.280
So that back
stern line is going

21:21.280 --> 21:22.933
to automatically come
off because, one, it's

21:22.933 --> 21:23.934
not really doing anything.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.327
Go from bow to stern.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.329
But you guys pull the
lines in my hand, right?

21:27.329 --> 21:28.809
- Yeah.
- You stow them?

21:28.809 --> 21:30.245
Yeah.
I think we might stow them.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.073
Yeah, like we got
like a three hour trip

21:32.073 --> 21:33.683
so we're definitely
going to stow them away,

21:33.683 --> 21:36.730
but it's the fenders that if
we're going to deflate or not.

21:36.730 --> 21:37.948
That makes no sense.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.167
We'll have to
deflate all of them.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.212
<i>I've been in the
industry for four years.</i>

21:42.953 --> 21:44.346
Do we take the fenders off
after the launch

21:44.346 --> 21:45.956
come off or before?

21:45.956 --> 21:48.089
Oh, unless, because what we
do on other boat sometimes--

21:48.089 --> 21:49.351
You got to wait
until you get away

21:49.351 --> 21:51.266
from the docks and .
- Never mind.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.877
But, Kyle, he might have
more experience than me,

21:53.877 --> 21:56.750
but you know, someone who
knows everything knows nothing.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.060
All crew, it's game time.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.279
Let's get into our whites.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.367
OK.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.195
Guests inbound 20 minutes.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.805
Have champagne
and towels ready.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.202
What is this?
Ay-yi-yi.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.730
Looking good, mate.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.123
You're done.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.168
- This is like the worst news.
- Yeah, it is.

22:24.168 --> 22:25.779
It definitely the worst thing
that could have happened.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.084
- Yeah.
- Kyle, should we go?

22:27.084 --> 22:27.868
Yeah.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.304
We'll go now.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.914
OK, so you guys are
going straight to the dock?

22:30.914 --> 22:32.089
- Yes.
- OK, great.

22:32.089 --> 22:33.961
So picking them up
from a hotel,

22:33.961 --> 22:35.397
and then we're going back
to get their bags.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.443
You're in the best hands
you can be in right now.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.314
Yeah.

22:39.314 --> 22:40.881
<i>I love hard work just
because it makes you</i>

22:40.881 --> 22:42.622
stronger and a better person.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.319
Whoever rolled
these towels sucks.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.843
<i>When I was younger, my mom
was in and out of jail.</i>

22:46.843 --> 22:48.628
We were practically
always poor,

22:48.628 --> 22:51.021
<i>and as soon as I was able
to get a job at like ten</i>

22:51.021 --> 22:53.589
<i>years old, I would be
working in hay fields</i>

22:53.589 --> 22:57.027
<i>and throwing hay bales and try
to make any dollar I could.</i>

22:57.027 --> 22:58.420
<i>Whatever cards
you're dealt,</i>

22:58.420 --> 22:59.987
you have to learn how
to play them, and that's

22:59.987 --> 23:01.597
what Texans are about.

23:01.597 --> 23:02.990
Oh, sh--.
They're there already.

23:02.990 --> 23:04.818
- They got their luggage.
- Howdy. Howdy. Howdy.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.776
- Yo. Yo.
- Ready to party?

23:06.776 --> 23:07.777
You know it.

23:07.777 --> 23:08.778
I'm Lewis.

23:08.778 --> 23:09.997
Perfect.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.434
- Hop on board.
- Let's go.

23:12.434 --> 23:15.263
All crew, all crew, guests
on board, five minutes

23:15.263 --> 23:16.743
until arrival.

23:16.743 --> 23:19.398
It's fine. It's fine.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.314
Just breathe.

23:23.314 --> 23:24.838
There she is.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.754
All crew, all crew, that's
two minutes until arrival.

23:27.754 --> 23:28.711
Two minutes.

23:28.711 --> 23:31.497
OK. OK.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.933
Coming ahead, starboard line.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.674
Be prepared to
welcome the guests.

23:34.674 --> 23:35.675
Sh--.

23:35.675 --> 23:37.720
Yeah.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.852
I'll tie them off.

23:38.852 --> 23:39.809
Thank you so much.

23:39.809 --> 23:40.897
Sure.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.334
All righty.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.902
- Hello.
- Good day.

23:45.902 --> 23:46.947
How are we doing?

23:46.947 --> 23:48.427
- Hi.
- Finishing these?

23:48.427 --> 23:49.384
Come on, guys.

23:49.384 --> 23:50.559
Dude.

23:50.559 --> 23:51.778
Come on, man.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.127
Start making some cocktails.

23:53.127 --> 23:53.997
Yeah.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.521
What do you want me to make?

23:55.521 --> 23:56.565
Anything.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.524
Hi, Dan. Nice to meet you.

23:58.524 --> 23:59.655
- Hey.
- G'day. I'm Kerry.

23:59.655 --> 24:00.700
Welcome aboard.
- Nice to meet you.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.092
G'day. Welcome aboard.
I'm Kerry.

24:02.092 --> 24:03.703
- Which one's the big one?
- Uh...

24:03.703 --> 24:05.487
there's plenty coming.
Don't worry.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.489
I'm a little nervous
to deal with guests.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.012
<i>I've never even worked
in the service industry.</i>

24:09.012 --> 24:10.536
<i>But I mean, I'm here to learn.</i>

24:10.536 --> 24:12.102
Welcome aboard.

24:12.102 --> 24:14.104
And, yeah, I mean, I do look
good in uniform, you know.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.280
I kind of look good
in coveralls too though.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.935
On behalf of the crew of
"Mercury," happy 40th birthday.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.937
I want to welcome you
to your Norway adventure.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.330
This is the chief stew, Faye.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.332
Right now, Faye is going
to take you on a tour.

24:24.332 --> 24:25.942
Would you like me
to show you around?

24:25.942 --> 24:27.291
- Yes.
- Wait.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.336
We got to do--

24:28.336 --> 24:29.468
I mean-- We have to.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.512
Yes.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.557
I can't with you guys.

24:31.557 --> 24:32.601
Now it's started.

24:32.601 --> 24:36.518
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.738
So we're going to start
all the way to the top.

24:38.738 --> 24:39.739
But we need a refill.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.567
OK.

24:41.567 --> 24:42.785
OK, so this is the sun deck.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.395
- Oh my gosh.
- Look at this.

24:44.395 --> 24:47.790
Look at this bed.
- Yeah, I sleep there.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.575
So hopefully,
the sun comes out.

24:49.575 --> 24:50.967
I mean, nap time.

24:50.967 --> 24:52.447
So beautiful.

24:52.447 --> 24:55.276
OK, do you want to follow
me down to the sky deck?

24:55.276 --> 24:58.148
So this is probably going
to be a more social area for

24:58.148 --> 25:00.281
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

25:00.281 --> 25:03.414
So there's two doors, just
pop your finger on there,

25:03.414 --> 25:04.677
and it comes open.

25:04.677 --> 25:05.765
Magic.

25:05.765 --> 25:06.896
Welcome to the sky lounge.

25:06.896 --> 25:07.941
Oh.

25:07.941 --> 25:09.377
It's so comfy.

25:09.377 --> 25:11.292
So good.

25:11.292 --> 25:12.772
So cozy.

25:12.772 --> 25:14.556
So this is the main salon.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.427
This is beautiful.

25:16.427 --> 25:17.994
Can we play drinking
games on the table?

25:17.994 --> 25:19.561
Absolutely.

25:19.561 --> 25:23.434
We're going to make our way
down now to your guest cabins.

25:23.434 --> 25:26.002
Sarah, you are definitely
going to fall down this.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.830
Yeah, I'm definitely
falling down.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.876
This is actually
the primary suite.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.834
I think you guys
should be in this room.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.314
- We'll take it.
- We'll take it.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.533
Beautiful.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.577
- This is so pretty.
- It's awesome, man.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.578
There's two doubles.

25:36.578 --> 25:37.579
I love this room.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.798
And two twins.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.147
We get twins, buddy boy.

25:40.147 --> 25:42.192
We'll bring your
luggage down as well.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.238
Kasie is making some
nice drinks for you.

25:44.238 --> 25:45.718
Shots.

25:48.634 --> 25:52.942
What's that?

25:52.942 --> 25:54.814
It's so strong.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.511
- Let's go.
- Yes.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.644
Let's go.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.124
Don't fall off.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.605
Let's do the wheels, because
they'll ruin the carpets.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.911
Lovely.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.695
Would you like a
refreshing spritzer?

26:06.695 --> 26:07.740
- Yeah.
- I do. I do want one.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.437
Look at those party straws.

26:09.437 --> 26:11.657
Thank you.

26:11.657 --> 26:12.832
And the champagne is coming.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.485
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

26:14.485 --> 26:16.009
I can't wait for
dirty martinis later.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.663
Lewis,
departure in ten minutes.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.143
Copy that.

26:20.143 --> 26:21.362
How's this look?

26:21.362 --> 26:22.406
Dorky, man.

26:22.406 --> 26:23.843
Yeah, OK.

26:23.843 --> 26:25.061
What's your game plan, Lewis?

26:25.061 --> 26:26.323
What position do you--

26:26.323 --> 26:27.498
Two of you are going
to be over there.

26:27.498 --> 26:28.891
One of you is going
to be on the side.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.371
And the captain wants
me on the bow.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.199
It's going to be a
super easy departure.

26:32.199 --> 26:34.941
OK, gentlemen,
are we ready to go?

26:34.941 --> 26:35.942
Ready on the bow.

26:35.942 --> 26:36.986
OK, bow to stern.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.031
We are leaving the dock.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.467
Start from the
eye of it, bro.

26:39.467 --> 26:40.424
- Does it work?
- It's not, but it will be.

26:40.424 --> 26:42.035
There you go.

26:42.035 --> 26:44.167
I need another drink.

26:44.167 --> 26:45.516
Counterclock--
or clockwise?

26:45.516 --> 26:46.343
Clockwise.

26:46.343 --> 26:48.041
Hold the fender, please.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.740
Please hold the fender
till I leave the port.

26:51.740 --> 26:52.872
Hold all fenders?

26:52.872 --> 26:54.221
You want to put
this one back out?

26:54.221 --> 26:56.310
"Mercury" departing
Alesund harbor.

26:56.310 --> 26:59.095
Hold all fenders until
we've cleared the port.

26:59.095 --> 27:00.531
Too late.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.359
I see this ferry
coming in now.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.887
<i>Kyle walks up on the bow,</i>

27:07.887 --> 27:09.845
picks up a fender
this frickin' big,

27:09.845 --> 27:11.673
<i>and puts it right in front
of my face while I'm</i>

27:11.673 --> 27:13.719
going through the narrowest
part of the channel.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.507
20 meters from the bow.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.117
15 meters.
- Your need move, mate.

27:21.117 --> 27:22.205
You've got to move. Move.

27:22.205 --> 27:23.990
Oh my god.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.302
You've got to move, mate.
You've got to move.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.218
I see this ferry coming in now.

27:39.745 --> 27:40.702
Yep, I'm doing that now.

27:43.096 --> 27:44.619
Oh, my God.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.273
15 meters.

27:47.753 --> 27:48.841
Holy moly, we're doing it.

27:48.841 --> 27:49.885
We out?

27:49.885 --> 27:51.713
Oh, we got a wave.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.019
OK, fenders up.

27:55.978 --> 27:59.112
We've cleared the port.
We've cleared the port.

28:02.942 --> 28:04.421
Oh my god. Look at this.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.727
Both of you guys
look up front.

28:05.727 --> 28:06.946
These damn fjords are--

28:06.946 --> 28:09.252
- They're spectacular.
- Whoo.

28:09.252 --> 28:11.254
I mean, Norway is gorgeous.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.169
It's amazing.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.910
Oh, fudge.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.216
Spray down that corner.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.827
Give it a scrub with a mitt.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.046
Is there soap in this?

28:20.046 --> 28:21.351
Is there soap?

28:21.351 --> 28:23.484
I mean, it says "OSC" on it.

28:23.484 --> 28:25.007
Oh, yeah, that's not soap.

28:25.007 --> 28:25.965
Oh, .

28:25.965 --> 28:27.662
It's acid.

28:27.662 --> 28:29.664
This does smell
kind of harsh.

28:29.664 --> 28:32.580
I know Mike's joined without
ever being on a yacht before.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.408
<i>On my first boat,
my first first officer</i>

28:34.408 --> 28:35.496
<i>wasn't a nice guy.</i>

28:35.496 --> 28:37.498
He threatened me
with violence once.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.500
<i>He was a bit of a bastard
to work for, to be honest.</i>

28:39.500 --> 28:41.807
I made the decision that I
don't want to be like him.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.374
I don't want to make anyone
feel like I did then.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.028
I'll put the hose away.

28:46.028 --> 28:47.682
What are you
doing for dinner?

28:47.682 --> 28:50.772
I think I'm going to do steak
with a nice pasta to start.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.079
For dessert, I'm going to do
a deconstructed cheesecake.

28:53.079 --> 28:55.255
That sounds perfect.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.431
Oh, we're rocking.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.694
This is nice.
I'm not going to lie.

28:59.694 --> 29:00.695
Look at that V.

29:00.695 --> 29:01.914
We're getting
closer to the V.

29:01.914 --> 29:03.611
That's what she said.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.265
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

29:05.265 --> 29:06.614
Did y'all do the windows?

29:06.614 --> 29:09.660
Yeah, we did the
windows and everything.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.662
Oh, god.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.577
Leave me alone.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.623
- Children.
- Everyone good?

29:15.623 --> 29:16.667
Fantastic.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.278
Could we do a
specialty cocktail

29:18.278 --> 29:19.366
that we could do shots of?

29:19.366 --> 29:21.672
Let me get creative.

29:21.672 --> 29:22.804
Dude.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.807
Going with the vodka, pineapple.

29:29.158 --> 29:30.943
Oh, yes.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.596
Nice head on those.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.076
It's all about
the shake, baby.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.077
Oh, yeah.

29:35.077 --> 29:36.296
What are those?

29:36.296 --> 29:40.082
- Uh-oh.
- OK, these are blue marines.

29:40.082 --> 29:41.736
I'm going to
chug it right away.

29:41.736 --> 29:44.913
It's got apple and
pineapple and vodka.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.219
Cheers, guys.
- Wow.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.655
That's strong.

29:47.655 --> 29:48.830
The view with the water
coming up, so peaceful,

29:48.830 --> 29:49.918
so nice.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.137
And we are hauling ass.

29:51.137 --> 29:52.442
It's freezing on this level.

29:52.442 --> 29:54.053
I'm going to go downstairs.
I can't.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.402
Cosmos.

29:55.402 --> 29:57.621
I don't even know what
the is, but--

29:57.621 --> 29:59.145
I can barely walk down
the stairs normally.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.146
This is nice.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.538
There's no wind.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.149
Your hair's looking
beautiful today.

30:03.149 --> 30:04.280
Is it?
Because it was a mess earlier.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.978
It's like shining.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.328
Nice, because I had to put so
much gel in it to control it.

30:08.328 --> 30:09.503
It's shining hard.

30:09.503 --> 30:10.896
How's everyone doing?

30:10.896 --> 30:11.984
Amazing.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.376
So how long are you here for?

30:13.376 --> 30:15.030
We'll be in Norway
for six weeks.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.379
- OK.
- Where are you from?

30:16.379 --> 30:17.380
Costa Rica.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.512
You're kidding?

30:18.512 --> 30:19.905
<i>I am a jungle girl.</i>

30:19.905 --> 30:22.037
Though I never really felt
like I fit in

30:22.037 --> 30:24.910
growing up in Seattle,
and I grew up Mormon,

30:24.910 --> 30:29.175
so I think moving to Costa Rica
was like a fresh start for me.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.872
So who's cute to you so far?

30:30.872 --> 30:32.004
Yeah.

30:32.004 --> 30:33.396
It was a bit of
a culture shock,

30:33.396 --> 30:35.659
<i>because I was 15
years old and I just</i>

30:35.659 --> 30:37.487
wanted to get
everything that I wasn't

30:37.487 --> 30:38.880
able to do out of my system.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.013
Like, in the Mormon
religion, there's

30:41.013 --> 30:42.710
no drinking, no smoking.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.538
They would always stress
the importance of never

30:44.538 --> 30:47.367
like laying horizontal
next to a guy or whatever.

30:47.367 --> 30:50.196
So I went a little crazy.

30:50.196 --> 30:51.414
Someone caught my eye?
- Yeah.

30:51.414 --> 30:52.633
You think?

30:52.633 --> 30:53.852
Yeah.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.550
I don't know if I
can claim that yet.

30:56.550 --> 30:57.812
Can I get you guys
anything else?

30:57.812 --> 30:59.292
- Jell-O shots.
- You got it.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.293
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.337
I love her.

31:01.337 --> 31:03.252
100% going to bang somebody.

31:03.252 --> 31:04.775
I love her.

31:09.737 --> 31:12.000
- Tequila.
- Here we go.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.393
- Jell-O shots.
- Yeah.

31:13.393 --> 31:14.742
- Whoo!
- Oh, no way.

31:14.742 --> 31:16.352
Whoo!

31:16.352 --> 31:17.353
Cheers to Norway.

31:17.353 --> 31:18.615
Love you, guys.

31:18.615 --> 31:21.705
Beer, champagne,
and blue Jell-O shots.

31:21.705 --> 31:24.491
We are going to do the martinis
with the stuffed olives.

31:24.491 --> 31:25.884
We don't have blue
cheese stuffed olives.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.407
You want me to make you some?
- Yes, please.

31:27.407 --> 31:28.799
So I need the martini glasses.

31:28.799 --> 31:30.279
I'll grab them.

31:30.279 --> 31:32.760
They're drinking stamina is
just to another level,

31:32.760 --> 31:34.936
a level that I haven't
actually seen before.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.982
We haven't even got
hardly any beers left.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.592
Do you think they
want to mix it up?

31:38.592 --> 31:40.289
- I think they probably do.
- Yeah.

31:40.289 --> 31:42.335
All right,
all right, all right.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.946
Being down a stew
is not bloody ideal.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.252
Do you want to put
them straight on?

31:46.252 --> 31:47.427
Yeah.

31:47.427 --> 31:48.950
Thank you so much
for doing that.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.431
So we did the dirty
martinis with olives

31:51.431 --> 31:53.607
stuffed with blue cheese.

31:53.607 --> 31:56.305
Oh, my God.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.960
- Lewis, Lewis.
- I'm on my way, Kerry.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.920
Nathan, go to bed.

32:02.833 --> 32:03.747
All is well.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.404
All decks are secured.

32:08.404 --> 32:09.797
Our guests are happy.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.016
Is there anything else we
can be getting on with?

32:15.455 --> 32:17.109
Over the top
and right in front of me.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.632
I couldn't see sh--.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.155
A lot of people
struggle to see

32:20.155 --> 32:22.984
the difference between
fault and responsibility.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.377
<i>The fender was an
honest mistake.</i>

32:24.377 --> 32:25.465
<i>Is that my fault?</i>

32:25.465 --> 32:27.119
Maybe not, but,
you know, I still

32:27.119 --> 32:28.468
got to take responsibility.

32:28.468 --> 32:30.600
I want Kerry to know that
it won't happen again.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.647
You're the bosun.
I want you to take care of it.

32:33.647 --> 32:35.388
- Yep.
<i>- Coming up...</i>

32:35.388 --> 32:36.476
Make sure to
watch me when I do this,

32:36.476 --> 32:37.433
because this
is what you want me

32:37.433 --> 32:38.826
to do all right, buddy?

32:38.826 --> 32:40.219
Mate, this is like my
thousandth time doing it.

32:40.219 --> 32:42.003
I know, man. I know.
And I'm just doing my job.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.787
That's cool. Bro, you're just
saying a bunch of sh--.

32:43.787 --> 32:45.485
No, I ain't saying
a bunch of sh--.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.878
Don't just rush me, you know.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.406
Please stand
by for anchoring.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.147
Both anchors ready to drop.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.539
Drop three shackles portside.

32:56.539 --> 32:57.540
Go ahead.

32:57.540 --> 32:59.586
Just go for it.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.895
Three shackles
to the waterline.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.897
Let's drop another
three shackles, please?

33:10.075 --> 33:11.206
What is the angle?

33:11.206 --> 33:12.120
Yeah, it's starting
to come up now.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.469
Short stay.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.254
OK, let's drop our
last shackle, please?

33:15.254 --> 33:16.385
Never seen this before.

33:16.385 --> 33:17.604
We're in some deep water.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.693
We're almost at
our limit at chain,

33:19.693 --> 33:22.522
so we're lowering it slowly
to get all the chain out.

33:22.522 --> 33:25.046
Many of these areas
are 50 meters deep.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.396
There's only a few areas we
can actually anchor safely.

33:27.396 --> 33:29.746
So we want every bit of
chain out because it's so deep.

33:29.746 --> 33:31.009
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.185
But we also don't
want to lose the anchor.

33:33.185 --> 33:36.101
You ought to come up to a
plateau of about 50 meters,

33:36.101 --> 33:38.929
and we've got an anchor right
in the middle of that plateau.

33:38.929 --> 33:40.801
<i>If the winds kick up,
the anchor slips,</i>

33:40.801 --> 33:42.150
the vessel's in danger.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.196
I need confirmation
that we're secured.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.893
Can someone give
me the angle, please?

33:45.893 --> 33:47.242
Straight up and down, bro.

33:47.242 --> 33:48.374
It's still up and down.

33:48.374 --> 33:49.505
We are secured.

33:49.505 --> 33:51.246
Beautiful.

33:51.246 --> 33:54.075
Spectacular.

33:56.599 --> 33:57.687
Knocky-knockies.

33:57.687 --> 33:58.732
How are you feeling?

33:58.732 --> 33:59.907
Does your stomach feel better?

33:59.907 --> 34:04.651
A little bit,
but I'd rather just try.

34:04.651 --> 34:05.608
- OK.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.219
Stand by, thank you.

34:07.219 --> 34:08.785
this stupid oven.

34:08.785 --> 34:10.570
How effing deep is this?

34:10.570 --> 34:12.311
Look at those houses.

34:12.311 --> 34:13.573
Look at those little things.

34:13.573 --> 34:15.662
- Hi.
- Oh, why, hello.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.098
Hello.
Thank you for coming back.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.578
Can you stick
some beers in there?

34:18.578 --> 34:19.753
They want another.

34:19.753 --> 34:21.276
You look a lot better.
- Thank you.

34:21.276 --> 34:22.625
I'm good for now.

34:22.625 --> 34:23.974
I don't know what's
going to happen next,

34:23.974 --> 34:26.107
but let's just rally for now.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.456
For dinner-- ouch.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.632
Oh.

34:29.632 --> 34:32.200
For dinner, we're going
to do the big theme.

34:32.200 --> 34:36.422
So I will do the table
setup and everything,

34:36.422 --> 34:38.293
and why don't you
go down to laundry

34:38.293 --> 34:39.425
and give it a little bit of
love and care down there?

34:39.425 --> 34:40.643
Got it.

34:40.643 --> 34:41.818
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.646
I woke up with food
poisoning thinking

34:43.646 --> 34:45.039
<i>can this day get any worse?</i>

34:45.039 --> 34:49.696
And, yes, it can,
because now I'm in laundry.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.003
What's up?

34:53.003 --> 34:54.004
You want me to do
something with that?

34:54.004 --> 34:55.136
Can we leave it in
the sink?

34:55.136 --> 34:56.181
because we can't get
in the lazaret.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.573
Temporarily.

34:57.573 --> 35:00.010
What about-- what
about a flower?

35:00.010 --> 35:01.142
I'd like to try and clean it.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.317
Thank you very much.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.014
Oriana is hot.

35:04.014 --> 35:04.841
I'm single.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.800
I'm a single pringle.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.019
Got find more flowers, boys.

35:09.019 --> 35:12.022
Let's try and tidy up
and then go on a break,

35:12.022 --> 35:13.720
because you don't know how
late you're going to be up.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.895
- That's true.
- Thank you.

35:14.895 --> 35:17.637
Water temperature here
it's like 58.3.

35:17.637 --> 35:20.074
I'll swan dive off this.

35:20.074 --> 35:21.858
If they're anything
more than tipsy,

35:21.858 --> 35:23.121
they're not jumping
in the water.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.861
- They're pretty sauced.
- Where are we?

35:24.861 --> 35:26.254
Are we still in Norway?

35:26.254 --> 35:27.647
You got to give them
the alphabet test, though.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.170
That sh--'s hard in general.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.432
Alphabet?

35:30.432 --> 35:31.999
You have to say the
alphabet backwards.

35:31.999 --> 35:36.830
Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O M
N L K J I H G F E D C B A.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.659
Oh my god, she
says it just as fast.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.574
When I brush my teeth,
I have to say it twice

35:41.574 --> 35:43.315
forward and twice backwards.

35:43.315 --> 35:44.359
I just really like oral health.

35:44.359 --> 35:45.360
Same.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.883
I just like oral.

35:48.320 --> 35:52.628
All crew, all crew,
let's be in blacks by 9:00.

35:52.628 --> 35:54.239
Should we set a time
for them?

35:54.239 --> 35:56.241
Maybe they want to get ready
for dinner, maybe they don't.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.633
Let me know.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.200
The dynamic between the
chef and the chief stew

35:59.200 --> 36:02.072
is so important that it
can make or break a trip.

36:02.072 --> 36:04.162
If they're hungry,
then we can move quicker.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.034
I will do.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.949
She lets me take a lot
of control, which I like.

36:08.949 --> 36:11.038
She's not micromanaging me in
any way so I can respect that.

36:11.038 --> 36:11.865
I will do.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.040
I'll let you know.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.650
Thank you.

36:14.650 --> 36:16.217
All righty, let's see what
we've got going on here, huh?

36:16.217 --> 36:18.219
I generally find with
like the Aussie captains

36:18.219 --> 36:20.700
that I've worked with, they
do like to get involved

36:20.700 --> 36:22.919
and be seen, and I love that.

36:22.919 --> 36:24.704
That's a professional captain.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.358
Shot glasses.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.534
I know they're going to try
pouring drink in these horns.

36:28.534 --> 36:29.926
Why not?

36:29.926 --> 36:31.580
I was coming in
here, but I was

36:31.580 --> 36:33.408
going to see how angry you were
before I entered the galley.

36:33.408 --> 36:34.540
Am I angry?

36:34.540 --> 36:35.758
I don't know.

36:35.758 --> 36:37.586
I'm just careful
before I go in galleys.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.414
Wah!

36:39.414 --> 36:41.199
- What time do you like dinner?
- Dinner at 10:00?

36:41.199 --> 36:42.025
Perfect.

36:42.025 --> 36:43.505
We got to go freshen up.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.551
They want dinner at 10:00.

36:45.551 --> 36:46.639
OK, no problem.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.118
<i>We are very far north.</i>

36:48.118 --> 36:49.598
Getting a lot of things
that we're used to getting

36:49.598 --> 36:50.817
in the Mediterranean
or in America

36:50.817 --> 36:52.427
<i>is not
going to be happening,</i>

36:52.427 --> 36:53.602
<i>but that doesn't matter.</i>

36:53.602 --> 36:56.170
The first meal
has to be perfect.

36:57.563 --> 36:58.825
Where are my slippers?

36:58.825 --> 37:01.915
Check me out.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.221
I'm keen for everyone
to get their rest.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.396
Kyle, you're off.

37:04.396 --> 37:05.745
These steps I'm
definitely falling down.

37:05.745 --> 37:06.920
Concentrate.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.487
It's outside-in, right?

37:08.487 --> 37:09.705
I've never peed outside.

37:09.705 --> 37:10.750
No way.

37:10.750 --> 37:11.968
I'll pee on you inside.

37:11.968 --> 37:14.144
Wait, what?

37:14.144 --> 37:14.971
In the ocean.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.321
Ocean doesn't count.

37:16.321 --> 37:17.409
That doesn't count.

37:17.409 --> 37:19.324
- Drunk outside of a bar--
- Nope.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.413
- Super long ladies' line...
- Never done it.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.328
You go next to a car,
and you hide.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.546
- No.
- Oh, .

37:24.546 --> 37:25.765
I will never do it,
never, ever, ever.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.462
I've done that I don't
know how many times.

37:27.462 --> 37:28.637
- Are we ready?
- Hi.

37:28.637 --> 37:29.682
- We're ready.
- Are you ready?

37:29.682 --> 37:30.726
Are we allowed up?

37:30.726 --> 37:31.858
Absolutely.

37:31.858 --> 37:32.859
It's 10:00.

37:32.859 --> 37:33.816
Come on up.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.340
Awesome.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.516
Oh my God, look at the
Viking helmet with the horns.

37:37.516 --> 37:38.517
- Yes.
- Yes.

37:38.517 --> 37:39.648
This is amazing.

37:39.648 --> 37:42.042
Does anyone
want Viking shots?

37:42.042 --> 37:43.957
- Yes. Whatever it is, yes.
- Yes. Yes.

37:43.957 --> 37:45.132
- Cheers.
- Cheers, guys.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.046
Cheers.

37:46.046 --> 37:48.744
Chocolate milk?
Yoohoo!

37:48.744 --> 37:50.006
Just grabbing a
little tea time, boss.

37:50.006 --> 37:51.617
Sorry, boss.
- It's OK.

37:51.617 --> 37:52.835
One thing though.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.359
Not me,
the captain said you blocked

37:54.359 --> 37:58.014
his view with the
fender during departure.

37:58.014 --> 38:00.321
Hold all fenders until
we've cleared the port.

38:00.321 --> 38:01.714
Huh? Too late.

38:01.714 --> 38:03.324
This is hardest working
with the complaints, huh?

38:03.324 --> 38:04.978
You know, we're learning how
he runs a boat, that's all.

38:04.978 --> 38:07.328
Yeah. This is the face
of a guy who gives a .

38:07.328 --> 38:08.938
Ugh.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.332
<i>Coming up...</i>

38:11.332 --> 38:13.334
I've been calling you
for service for a while.

38:13.334 --> 38:16.119
Timing is a sh-- show.

38:16.119 --> 38:18.774
Whatever Jess is doing, just
tell her to keep doing it.

38:18.774 --> 38:21.864
Oh my god.

38:26.086 --> 38:27.522
I'm starving.

38:27.522 --> 38:28.697
What should I say?
Two minutes?

38:28.697 --> 38:30.090
Yeah.

38:30.090 --> 38:31.221
Are you going to get
all the girls in here?

38:31.221 --> 38:32.658
Yeah.

38:32.658 --> 38:35.835
We're going to be ready with
starters in two minutes.

38:35.835 --> 38:36.966
Hey, [inaudible],
how are doing?

38:36.966 --> 38:38.316
- I'm good, man.
- Good. Good.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.578
So have you ever done
an anchor watch before?

38:39.578 --> 38:40.927
- Yeah, I've done [inaudible].
- Excellent.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.277
So here in Norway,
because of the fjords,

38:43.277 --> 38:45.410
we don't get a good
angle of the sky

38:45.410 --> 38:48.848
all the time,
so we can't rely on GPS.

38:48.848 --> 38:51.241
I would have preferred to
explain to all deck crew

38:51.241 --> 38:53.026
<i>at the same time,
but everybody's</i>

38:53.026 --> 38:54.767
<i>on different breaks,
and I have to trust</i>

38:54.767 --> 38:56.682
on each guy
to pass on my orders

38:56.682 --> 38:58.118
to the next person on shift.

38:58.118 --> 39:00.120
For me, one of the
biggest concerns

39:00.120 --> 39:02.165
is people can get
complacent, all right.

39:02.165 --> 39:04.864
So, Kyle, regardless if he
says he knows it already,

39:04.864 --> 39:06.605
you tell him it all.

39:06.605 --> 39:08.302
OK then, perfect.

39:08.302 --> 39:10.348
Are you going to put like
a list out tonight, bro?

39:10.348 --> 39:11.610
Like hand over list--
- Do you know what?

39:11.610 --> 39:13.568
Where you can mark
off what you've done,

39:13.568 --> 39:15.440
what you haven't done,
we sign off on it,

39:15.440 --> 39:16.615
and then be able to--

39:16.615 --> 39:17.616
Right here, mate.

39:17.616 --> 39:18.660
Everyone can write on it.

39:18.660 --> 39:19.966
Right, but you
should have like

39:19.966 --> 39:23.709
a borderline template
like so you can follow

39:23.709 --> 39:24.753
in somebody's footsteps.
- Yeah.

39:24.753 --> 39:25.711
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

39:25.711 --> 39:26.886
I did one.

39:26.886 --> 39:27.974
I know.

39:27.974 --> 39:30.106
I'm like so like
drunk and sleepy.

39:31.717 --> 39:32.631
OK, this is getting cold.

39:32.631 --> 39:33.980
This needs to go out.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.721
The first meal sets
the tone for the trip.

39:35.721 --> 39:38.201
Can you guys bring tongs?

39:38.201 --> 39:40.203
<i>Usually, the stew pantry
is attached to the galley.</i>

39:40.203 --> 39:42.292
Now we're completely separated.

39:42.292 --> 39:44.164
So I don't know
what's going on.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.687
<i>I have no communication.</i>

39:45.687 --> 39:48.124
I need to know where people
are, what's happening.

39:48.124 --> 39:49.561
I love our team, by the way.

39:49.561 --> 39:50.649
Oh my god, yeah.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.172
It's like actually the best.

39:52.172 --> 39:54.043
Why don't they come?

39:54.043 --> 39:55.175
I said two minutes.

39:55.175 --> 39:56.742
We are ready for service.

39:56.742 --> 39:57.830
Yeah.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.484
This is perfect.
I'm so happy.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.487
OK.

40:02.487 --> 40:05.446
Timing is a sh-- show.

40:05.446 --> 40:07.100
We've been calling you
for service for a while.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.057
I can't hear.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.407
Why can't I hear?

40:12.235 --> 40:13.715
He's the guy who like
your lobster.

40:13.715 --> 40:15.325
Can you come down and
get the rest of the plates?

40:15.325 --> 40:16.805
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- I don't even know what

40:16.805 --> 40:18.677
this is, a lobster--

40:18.677 --> 40:20.548
Lobster, uh--

40:20.548 --> 40:22.463
<i>I just don't get
on with radios,</i>

40:22.463 --> 40:26.119
and I've got an earpiece just
popping out the whole time,

40:26.119 --> 40:28.556
and it's absolutely not
how I needed to start

40:28.556 --> 40:29.862
this first dinner service.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.690
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- Katy, here's yours.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.605
- Pasta with--
- Jess.

40:33.605 --> 40:34.649
Pasta--

40:34.649 --> 40:36.303
- Jess.
- Jess.

40:36.303 --> 40:39.654
Tonight to start, we had a
homemade linguine with lobster

40:39.654 --> 40:40.873
and lobster bisque.

40:40.873 --> 40:41.961
- Thank you.
- Wow.

40:41.961 --> 40:43.310
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you.

40:43.310 --> 40:45.051
- You're welcome, guys.
- Awesome.

40:45.051 --> 40:46.705
- This is ridiculous.
- So good.

40:46.705 --> 40:48.271
This might be
the best meal I've ever had.

40:48.271 --> 40:49.925
This is our lives right now?

40:49.925 --> 40:51.884
It feels so good up here.

40:51.884 --> 40:53.973
What up, buddy?

40:53.973 --> 40:55.061
What's up, man?

40:55.061 --> 40:56.715
How you doing?
You good?

40:56.715 --> 41:00.327
I'm going up to the bridge now
so I can show you everything.

41:00.327 --> 41:01.676
Girls, how are they
doing on first course?

41:01.676 --> 41:03.504
I just want to see if
I can put the steaks on.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.114
Hey got sunburned.
Look at his--

41:05.114 --> 41:06.899
- Look at his face.
- Because I got so much sun.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.030
Do you guys have
suntan lotion?

41:08.030 --> 41:09.597
- From today?
- Yeah.

41:09.597 --> 41:10.990
The sun's up for 20 hours.

41:10.990 --> 41:13.471
I'd say halfway
through their starter.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.385
This is the logbook,
all right?

41:15.385 --> 41:17.170
You know how to read the
radars and everything.

41:17.170 --> 41:19.389
Yeah.
So we're just doing the lat

41:19.389 --> 41:20.521
and long
of the anchor every hour

41:20.521 --> 41:21.609
or every two hours?

41:21.609 --> 41:22.958
Yeah, every hour.

41:22.958 --> 41:26.092
I'm going to show you
exactly what he wanted.

41:26.092 --> 41:28.486
I'll show you now where
we are right here.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.574
I know all this.

41:29.574 --> 41:31.010
Cut straight to what
you want to say.

41:31.010 --> 41:32.751
Get through as fast
as possible, bro.

41:32.751 --> 41:35.101
All right, man, take it easy.
I'm going to get there.

41:35.101 --> 41:36.363
Bro, you're just saying
a bunch of sh--.

41:36.363 --> 41:37.799
No, I ain't saying
a bunch of sh--.

41:37.799 --> 41:39.105
Don't just rush me, you know.

41:39.105 --> 41:40.672
I got to take my time
so I can make sure--

41:40.672 --> 41:42.064
Yeah, but other people
don't learn that way.

41:42.064 --> 41:43.588
Make sure you
watch me when I do this,

41:43.588 --> 41:45.067
because this is what you want
me to do all right, buddy?

41:45.067 --> 41:46.155
Mate, this is like my
thousandth time--

41:46.155 --> 41:47.548
I know, man.

41:47.548 --> 41:48.767
I know, and I'm just
doing my job, you know?

41:48.767 --> 41:50.464
That's cool.

41:56.209 --> 41:57.732
It might have been
the best thing I've

41:57.732 --> 41:58.907
ever eaten in my entire life.

41:58.907 --> 42:00.039
- That was a delicious pasta.
- Good.

42:00.039 --> 42:01.954
I'll tell her.
- Really good.

42:01.954 --> 42:04.652
Whatever Jess is doing, just
tell her to keep doing it.

42:06.175 --> 42:07.307
You know how to
read that, right?

42:07.307 --> 42:08.917
Yes or no?
You know how to read that?

42:08.917 --> 42:12.355
I heard you.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.926
<i>This season
on "Below Deck Adventure..."</i>

42:22.670 --> 42:25.543
My favorite drink is
an espresso martini.

42:26.935 --> 42:29.024
This is the wildest
charter season of my life.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.419
- Jesus Christ.
- You guys all right?

42:32.419 --> 42:33.507
Get off the radio.

42:33.507 --> 42:34.682
We're not having
a conversation here.

42:34.682 --> 42:35.814
We're trying to do
something important.

42:35.814 --> 42:37.032
- I have a hair.
- Oh my god.

42:37.032 --> 42:38.381
Oh, god, don't do that.

42:38.381 --> 42:40.122
It's not five-star,
I'll tell you that much.

42:40.122 --> 42:41.254
You girls need to get
your sh-- together.

42:41.254 --> 42:42.647
Our sh-- is together.

42:42.647 --> 42:44.126
Maybe you need to get
your sh-- together.

42:44.126 --> 42:46.433
I had a complaint about
some of your behavior.

42:46.433 --> 42:48.087
It's not acceptable
on the boat.

42:48.087 --> 42:49.436
There's a problem
with the controls.

42:49.436 --> 42:51.177
I have no eyes at
the back of the boat.

42:51.177 --> 42:52.265
Engineering.
Engineering.

42:52.265 --> 42:53.396
Lost starboard engine.
- Throw it.

42:53.396 --> 42:55.181
- Whoa.
- Just fell down the steps.

42:55.181 --> 42:56.617
- Augh!
- You all right, mate?

42:56.617 --> 42:57.749
Augh!

42:59.620 --> 43:00.490
Look at me.

43:00.490 --> 43:02.231
I look like a blow up doll.

43:02.231 --> 43:03.581
You do look like a cute doll.

43:03.581 --> 43:06.061
- Nice outfit.
- Thank you.
