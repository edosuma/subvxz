11:20.449 --> 11:22.818
They told me
that it was gonna
be a full flight.

11:22.852 --> 11:24.654
So?

11:24.687 --> 11:27.456
So, I hate strangers
sitting next to me
when I fly.

11:27.490 --> 11:29.091
So, if someone
approaches my aisle

11:29.125 --> 11:30.726
and looks like
they're gonna sit down,

11:30.760 --> 11:34.263
I just flash them
my Jesus hat

11:34.297 --> 11:38.134

and say, "Hello, friend."

11:39.068 --> 11:40.202
That's genius.

11:40.236 --> 11:42.305
Some people will sit
in the toilet

11:42.338 --> 11:44.340
the whole flight
rather than
park it next to me.

11:44.373 --> 11:47.109
What if
an actual believer comes

11:47.143 --> 11:48.611
and sits
in the middle seat

11:48.644 --> 11:52.148
and actually wants
to talk scripture
with you the entire flight?

11:52.181 --> 11:54.517

on my laptop.

Sure.

14:22.064 --> 14:23.766
Excuse me, sir.

14:23.799 --> 14:27.703
I think you might've
picked up my ticket

No, I don't think so.

I'm so sorry.
No, no, it's my fault.

It was my fault.
I set it down

Could've happened
to anybody who's
also from Iceland.

she was late for dinner.

15:22.158 --> 15:23.259
Late for dinner?

15:23.292 --> 15:24.694
Yeah, we used
to have dinner.

15:26.162 --> 15:28.364
Of course
there was no cooking
at her house.

15:29.632 --> 15:31.367
Then again,
there was no cooking
in my house.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.336

her Lean Cuisines.
She loved that.

How old was she?

15:38.574 --> 15:39.475
Fifteen.

15:41.811 --> 15:42.878
Fourteen.

15:42.912 --> 15:44.313
And how old were you?

15:44.347 --> 15:46.616
Let's just say that
I was old enough
to know better

15:46.649 --> 15:48.417
and young enough
not to care.

15:48.751 --> 15:49.819
Ew.

15:49.852 --> 15:52.822
I loved her.
And then she outgrew me.

15:54.890 --> 15:57.693
And then she left.

15:57.727 --> 15:59.362
But she came back.

16:00.563 --> 16:01.964
It's so <i>Lolita.</i>

16:13.242 --> 16:14.944
Yeah. But...
Where's the baby?

16:14.977 --> 16:17.346

you just let him.

16:34.730 --> 16:36.132
He isn't safe.

16:36.165 --> 16:38.935

16:38.968 --> 16:41.037
Where is he?
He's with Lars.

to my brother

23:54.799 --> 23:56.968
And I'm leaving you
my sleep wedge,

23:57.001 --> 23:59.103
because you look
like a fine, young man.

23:59.137 --> 24:01.172
Take good care of it.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.175
It's very expensive.

24:06.177 --> 24:07.512
(SIGHS)

24:07.545 --> 24:08.980
One second.

24:11.349 --> 24:13.017
I'm good.

24:16.521 --> 24:17.588
Sorry about that,
ladies and gentlemen.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.390
<i>We will now be</i>
<i>on our way.</i>

24:19.423 --> 24:21.192
Please make sure
that your seat belts
are securely fastened

24:21.225 --> 24:22.994
and kindly
turn your attention
to the screens.

24:23.027 --> 24:25.830
We'd like to play
a short safety video
for you.

24:25.863 --> 24:27.832
(REPEATING INSTRUCTIONS
IN FRENCH)

24:45.183 --> 24:47.718
Now, if this
was a confession,
which it isn't,

24:47.752 --> 24:49.887
because I'm innocent,

24:49.921 --> 24:52.824
but theoretically speaking,
if I were to do something,

24:52.857 --> 24:55.293
like rob
the post office,

24:55.326 --> 24:59.997
it would be because
I loved someone
very, very much,

25:00.031 --> 25:02.767
and I always will.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.436
POLICE OFFICER:
Theoretical love
is not dead.

25:05.470 --> 25:07.138
Hurray for us all.

25:08.739 --> 25:09.941
Come on. Let's go.

25:09.974 --> 25:11.042
I wanna see
the plane take off.

25:11.075 --> 25:12.944
It'll take off.

25:12.977 --> 25:15.847
I have what I want
in your arms.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.014
Let's go.

25:22.186 --> 25:24.989
NANCY: So,
what do we do now?

25:25.022 --> 25:28.292
We had quite
the road trip,
lots of adventures.

25:31.229 --> 25:32.497
How's Cesar?

25:32.530 --> 25:34.298
He's retired.

25:34.332 --> 25:35.967
NANCY: Retired, retired,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.202
like golf and
early bird dinner
retired,

25:38.236 --> 25:39.203
or your version
of retired?

25:39.237 --> 25:40.705
Like no longer
living retired?

25:40.738 --> 25:42.774
No, he's home
with his family.

25:42.807 --> 25:44.976
He's thinking
about buying a boat.

25:45.009 --> 25:48.146
NANCY:
I never figured him
for the nautical type.

25:48.179 --> 25:51.382
You could've come to me.
We would've worked it out.

25:51.415 --> 25:53.317
I panicked.

25:53.351 --> 25:57.021
A thousand chances you had.
And you took my child away.

25:58.689 --> 26:00.591
You kidnapped Shane.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.293
As a last measure.

26:02.326 --> 26:03.895
And he's a killer.

26:03.928 --> 26:04.962
So are you.

26:06.063 --> 26:08.499
So is Guillermo.

26:08.533 --> 26:10.435
Except when you're
supposed to be, fucker.

26:10.468 --> 26:12.136
Deal‐breaker fucker.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.572
Are you surprised I wasn't
your little errand boy
no more, Blanca?

26:15.273 --> 26:16.507
Don't you get it?

26:16.541 --> 26:18.009
I fucking hate you.

26:18.042 --> 26:21.612
You love me,
you sociopathic
piece of shit.

26:21.646 --> 26:23.748
We're homies.

26:23.781 --> 26:25.716
I'm gonna kill you,
homie.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.286
Gangland style. Ugly.

26:29.153 --> 26:30.755
Like your shoes?

26:30.788 --> 26:32.190
My shoes are awesome.

26:34.125 --> 26:37.962
So, the police
won't know anything
about Shane?

26:37.995 --> 26:40.498
You are a devoted mother,
aren't you?

26:40.531 --> 26:42.967
You'll say nice things
about me to Stevie?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.069
(CHUCKLES)

26:45.103 --> 26:48.539
I'll tell him
his mother loved him
very much.

26:48.573 --> 26:50.808
She was willing to
sacrifice everything
for him.

26:52.176 --> 26:53.778
Even her life.

26:55.313 --> 26:57.115
How about
a farewell fuck?

26:58.516 --> 27:02.186
That's crass.
And it won't save you.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.921
What will?

27:03.955 --> 27:04.956
Nothing.

27:06.991 --> 27:08.092
Except plan C.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.360
What's that?

27:09.393 --> 27:11.696
Hands up!
Hands up! FBI!

27:13.030 --> 27:14.699
Nancy Botwin.

27:14.732 --> 27:18.002
I killed Pilar Zuazo.
Please arrest me.
