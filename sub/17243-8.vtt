WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:04.237
Mom, can you come here, please?

00:04.272 --> 00:05.939
What?!

00:05.973 --> 00:07.774
- I said, come here, please!
- You come here!

00:07.808 --> 00:09.909
We got a big box sent to us!

00:09.943 --> 00:11.244
- We did?
- It's a package!

00:11.279 --> 00:12.746
- Who's it from?
- I don't know.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.715
Oh! It's for me!

00:15.750 --> 00:19.019
Thinking of you!

00:19.053 --> 00:21.588
"Dear M., hope this helps,

00:21.622 --> 00:25.158
I only wish I could do more, xoxo, J.S.P."

00:25.192 --> 00:27.927
Justine St. Pierre!

00:27.962 --> 00:31.298
David, one of my dear friends
is finally reaching out,

00:31.332 --> 00:34.100
and you know what, I
knew it would be Justine.

00:34.135 --> 00:38.638
She can be an angry drunk,
but we were always close.

00:38.673 --> 00:41.174
"Congratulations on your
Allez Vous Starter Kit."

00:41.208 --> 00:42.409
That frigid whore!

00:42.443 --> 00:44.110
What's Allez Vous?

00:44.145 --> 00:47.614
It's a scam, it's her
stupid cosmetics company!

00:47.648 --> 00:49.783
It's a pyramid scheme
for desperate housewives,

00:49.817 --> 00:51.551
and struggling actors!

00:51.585 --> 00:53.186
Well, how much can we make from this?

00:53.220 --> 00:55.455
David, it's an insult,
we're sending it back!

00:55.489 --> 00:57.057
Well, apparently you can win an Audi.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.458
What colour?

00:58.492 --> 01:00.860
A Champagne Audi, look at that!

01:00.895 --> 01:04.664
As if you could ever sell
enough of this crap to get a car.

01:04.699 --> 01:06.833
Well, Kristi Stubbs and
her team out of Montreal

01:06.867 --> 01:08.968
have sold enough to get the car, so...

01:09.003 --> 01:11.304
don't believe everything
you read, dear, please.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.806
(Gasps)

01:12.840 --> 01:14.507
- Burn it!
- Except this mascara.

01:14.542 --> 01:19.679
- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:22.450 --> 01:24.718
So Ray can't lend me his car today,

01:24.752 --> 01:28.455
because he has to drive his
92-year-old mother somewhere.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.257
Where does a 92-year-old
woman need to go?!

01:31.292 --> 01:33.660
I don't know, John, perhaps the hospital?

01:33.694 --> 01:35.795
Yeah, well, it's just I needed that car

01:35.830 --> 01:37.630
to get to my appointment today.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.265
What appointment?

01:39.300 --> 01:41.735
Well, you know, the uh...

01:41.769 --> 01:43.903
Thing that I had, I had a thing that I...

01:43.938 --> 01:46.573
What thing?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.975
An unemployment thing, okay?

01:49.009 --> 01:50.677
To get unemployment insurance,

01:50.711 --> 01:52.245
I have the meeting this afternoon,

01:52.279 --> 01:55.281
and now I have to grovel to Roland,

01:55.316 --> 01:58.318
to get his truck, in
order to get to Elmdale,

01:58.352 --> 01:59.786
to get this money...

01:59.820 --> 02:02.288
Well, I think you're brave,

02:02.323 --> 02:05.358
and while I didn't see us
living off of food stamps,

02:05.393 --> 02:08.961
I think there is something
very masculine about the way

02:08.996 --> 02:11.131
you're taking control of this situation.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.533
Sweetheart, I'm about to beg for a truck,

02:13.567 --> 02:15.869
in order to beg for money,

02:15.903 --> 02:17.404
I think you've gotta
raise that masculinity bar

02:17.438 --> 02:20.473
just... just a little.

02:20.508 --> 02:23.376
(Lawnmower buzzes loudly)

02:26.881 --> 02:28.615
- Roland!
- Hey, Johnny.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.617
- Hi!
- What?

02:30.651 --> 02:32.385
- Hi!
- Can't hear you.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.287
Hey, turn the motor off!

02:34.321 --> 02:35.855
I can't hear you, the motor's on!

02:35.890 --> 02:38.758
Turn the motor off!

02:38.793 --> 02:42.328
Turn the motor off, you dumb son of a...

02:42.363 --> 02:46.032
well, what can I do for you,
you "dumb son of a... "?

02:46.066 --> 02:48.401
(Both laugh)

02:48.436 --> 02:51.838
Hey Roland, I need...
I need to borrow your truck,

02:51.872 --> 02:54.040
I've got a very important
appointment today,

02:54.074 --> 02:57.210
and I sure could use it.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.646
Well of course, Johnny, you
know my truck is your truck,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.548
any time you wanna borrow it,
it's fine with me, no problem-

03:01.582 --> 03:03.342
well, that's very, very
nice, that's so nice.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.252
Listen, as the owner of the truck,

03:06.287 --> 03:07.787
would you do me one favour, though?

03:07.822 --> 03:09.823
When you return it, can
you bring the seats back up,

03:09.857 --> 03:11.191
the way I had 'em, I'd appreciate that.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.358
- I do.
- Well, you don't.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.493
But if could, I'd appreciate
it, that'd be great.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.228
Well, I think I do!

03:15.262 --> 03:17.096
- Here's the keys,
- Thank you.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.731
... and also, when you return it,

03:18.766 --> 03:20.700
if you don't mind just backing it in,

03:20.734 --> 03:21.968
because in the morning,
I have to kinda crick...

03:22.002 --> 03:24.337
Yeah, I'll back it in, I'll back it in!

03:24.371 --> 03:25.605
My neck like that, if you could
back it in that would be terrific.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.340
Sure, I'll back it in.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.542
The wiper fluid, um...

03:29.577 --> 03:32.679
I had to replace sooner than usual,

03:32.713 --> 03:34.914
- Now, I'm not asking...
- I don't touch the wiper fluid!

03:34.949 --> 03:36.649
- Well, okay, somebody did.
- I never use it.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.152
Yeah well, I guess your "imaginary
friend" uses wiper fluid, right?

03:39.186 --> 03:40.987
I don't know! I'm not
asking for payback here,

03:41.021 --> 03:42.355
but whatever you think
is fair would be terrific.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.990
Okay, I never use it, though.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.959
The radio was at a four.
I like it at a ten, so...

03:45.993 --> 03:48.261
Okay, you know what, I'm gonna walk!

03:48.295 --> 03:49.729
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna walk, Roland!

03:49.763 --> 03:50.897
- What do you mean you're walking?
- I don't want your truck!

03:50.931 --> 03:51.498
No, no, the truck's right
there, what are you talking...

03:51.532 --> 03:52.398
I don't need your truck!

03:52.433 --> 03:54.567
It's gonna be there all day!

03:54.602 --> 03:55.502
I'm just asking, maybe
you could put a little air

03:55.536 --> 03:57.170
in the tires, from time to time.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.405
Bonjour!

03:59.440 --> 04:01.741
Now that you've opened
your Allez Vous starter kit,

04:01.775 --> 04:04.244
let's begin with those
essential tips and tricks

04:04.278 --> 04:07.647
you'll need to make up
to 600,000 dollars a year.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.682
That's 50,000 a month,

04:09.717 --> 04:12.619
that's 7,000 dollars a week.

04:12.653 --> 04:16.055
No, it isn't! She didn't
finish high school.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.190
Now, you've heard of other
get rich quick schemes,

04:18.225 --> 04:21.094
but this isn't a scheme, it's a system.

04:21.128 --> 04:25.865
Look at the work she's
had done, it's grotesque.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.133
Justine St. Pierre: (On
video) Go grab a pen and paper,

04:27.167 --> 04:29.002
because I'm about to share
with you some essential

04:29.036 --> 04:32.639
tips and tricks to maximize
your sales productivity.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.574
If this seems like a dream come true,

04:34.608 --> 04:38.745
you need to pay attention
to my tips and tricks.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.413
But the best part is, the
products sell themselves!

04:40.447 --> 04:41.915
Okay, where are the tips and tricks?

04:41.949 --> 04:42.649
We've been watching this for five minutes,

04:42.683 --> 04:44.017
she's talking in circles!

04:44.051 --> 04:46.553
Because it's a scam!

04:46.587 --> 04:47.554
But if your father's
willing to go out there

04:47.588 --> 04:49.289
and sell his soul, dear,

04:49.323 --> 04:52.892
the least we can do is
try to sell this garbage.

04:52.927 --> 04:54.427
What's this? Huh?

04:54.461 --> 04:57.397
Oh, it's a sunless bronzing.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.399
Okay, let's sell it, how hard could it be?

04:59.433 --> 05:00.800
You sell you.

05:00.834 --> 05:04.304
You sell you using Allez Vous.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.039
Okay, we're going to have a luncheon.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.774
A luncheon?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.643
Mm-hmm, a luncheon for
our little townie friends.

05:10.678 --> 05:14.647
It's the least we could do. Hmm!

05:14.682 --> 05:16.916
System, support, tips, tricks,
community, opportunity, tips...

05:16.951 --> 05:19.018
Twyla?

05:19.053 --> 05:20.853
- Hey, what's up?
- Nothing.

05:20.888 --> 05:24.624
So um, Ted ordered toast, not home fries,

05:24.658 --> 05:26.359
and he got home fries, so would
you just be a peach, and...

05:26.393 --> 05:28.027
Oh, sorry.

05:28.062 --> 05:29.929
No, you know what? It's
okay. I'm good with it.

05:29.964 --> 05:33.232
I like home fries, I'm gonna eat 'em, so.

05:33.267 --> 05:37.303
First day of a cleanse,
so she's a little whoo!

05:37.338 --> 05:39.606
Okay, so I can take it back.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.040
- That would actually be great, if you wouldn't...
- No, no thank you.

05:41.075 --> 05:43.610
Lex, if you'll just let
me eat my breakfast here,

05:43.644 --> 05:44.510
it's not like there's broken glass in it.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.045
There's broken glass?

05:46.080 --> 05:48.114
No, there is not broken glass in it,

05:48.148 --> 05:50.984
just a lot of great flavours
that I can't wait to taste.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.352
(Sighs happily) Great!

05:54.221 --> 05:57.023
Thank you.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.858
I'm just trying to help you.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.895
Well, if you wanna help, eat something.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.198
I do not like what this
cleanse is doing to your brain.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.867
You're being very rude!

06:07.901 --> 06:09.202
I'm sorry for yelling.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.074

06:18.979 --> 06:20.513
(Claps)

06:20.547 --> 06:22.215
Ain't she a beaut?

06:22.249 --> 06:23.383
Boy, is she ever, Bob.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.685
You know, I uh...

06:25.719 --> 06:27.387
I woke up this morning, I said to myself,

06:27.421 --> 06:29.589
Johnny, you've gotta buy yourself a car.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.858
You may have a business
meeting in Elmdale one day,

06:31.892 --> 06:33.793
and you're gonna be in trouble.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.762
Yeah, I wouldn't have thought
this was your cup of tea.

06:35.796 --> 06:39.565
Oh, this is exactly what I was looking for!

06:39.600 --> 06:43.236
Yeah, I'd love to take this
baby out for a test drive.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.105
Yeah? I've got the keys,
let's take 'er for a spin.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.141
Not with you, Bob, I
don't wanna bother you.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.943
It's no bother.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.413
I would just love to
take this out myself, Bob,

06:53.447 --> 06:55.682
you know, a little peccadillo
of mine when I'm buying a car,

06:55.716 --> 06:58.217
I like to experience the car one on one,

06:58.252 --> 06:59.819
just me and the machine,

06:59.853 --> 07:01.020
you know what I mean?

07:01.055 --> 07:03.656
No, I don't.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.058
I just wanna take it out
for a test drive, Bob,

07:05.092 --> 07:06.759
just for a spin.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.728
So... Once around the block?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.263
Oh yeah, once around the block,

07:10.297 --> 07:11.397
you know, maybe around the corner,

07:11.432 --> 07:12.565
up the road a bit.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.233
What road?

07:14.268 --> 07:16.235
Well, this road, I'll take it up this road.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.204
Okay, but no lefts, okay?

07:18.238 --> 07:20.106
Because they lead to the highway,

07:20.140 --> 07:24.377
and I really don't want her on the highway.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.880
Why would I take it on the highway?

07:27.915 --> 07:31.551
♪ driving down that highway of life ♪

07:31.585 --> 07:34.620
♪ feelin' fine and feelin' sunny ♪

07:34.655 --> 07:37.190
♪ going to pick me up some money ♪

07:37.224 --> 07:40.426
(Hammering)

07:40.461 --> 07:41.894
You do know that just staring at the fence

07:41.929 --> 07:43.563
isn't gonna help me fix it, right?

07:43.597 --> 07:46.399
Yeah, I am.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.601
I'm just thinking about
Ted, and how nice he is,

07:48.635 --> 07:50.603
and... generous,

07:50.637 --> 07:52.672
like, almost too generous.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.108
And I just wanna grab him
by the sweater sometime,

07:55.142 --> 07:58.144
and be like, "stop being
so generous and nice!"

07:58.178 --> 08:00.146
He always has been.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.247
I feel bad thinking about all those times

08:01.281 --> 08:03.583
I pinned him against a locker.

08:03.617 --> 08:07.120
You pinned somebody against a locker?!

08:07.154 --> 08:09.756
Well, I was a different person then,

08:09.790 --> 08:12.592
a lot changed since after high school.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.495
So what did he do to make
you such a teenage cliché?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.296
He always said hi when
he passed me in the halls,

08:17.331 --> 08:19.332
and for some reason, it bugged me.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.334
Yeah, I can see that.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.402
So he's bugging you.

08:23.437 --> 08:24.871
What? No! Oh my God, no!

08:24.905 --> 08:26.773
Oh yes.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.375
No, I'm just saying, generally speaking,

08:29.409 --> 08:31.978
when you order breakfast and
they give you the wrong order,

08:32.011 --> 08:34.647
send it back and get the right order.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.216
I never return food,
I think that's so rude.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.618
(Alexis groans)

08:38.652 --> 08:42.188
(Johnny scats along with radio)

08:42.222 --> 08:44.557
(Clattering and hissing noise)

08:44.591 --> 08:46.692
Oh no!

08:46.727 --> 08:49.595
Oh, son of a bum!

08:49.630 --> 08:52.031
Son of a bitch!

08:52.065 --> 08:53.533
(Engine hisses and groans)

08:55.969 --> 08:59.505
Argh! What the hell?!

08:59.540 --> 09:01.407
Ugh!

09:01.441 --> 09:03.142
(Door shuts)

09:03.177 --> 09:05.278
Oh!

09:05.312 --> 09:08.114
Oh!

09:08.148 --> 09:09.148
(Breathing heavily)

09:12.753 --> 09:14.287
(Car hisses)

09:19.293 --> 09:21.627
Well, the good news is all
you need is a new fan belt,

09:21.662 --> 09:22.628
and then you'll be right back on the road.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.564
Good, good.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.866
Well, it was important I
get to Elmdale today, Roland,

09:26.900 --> 09:29.035
I appreciate you helping me out.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.837
Ah, it's no problem, Johnny.

09:30.871 --> 09:34.574
So, where in Elmdale am I taking you?

09:34.608 --> 09:38.811
Oh, just the general
downtown area will be fine.

09:38.846 --> 09:42.215
Okay, don't wanna tell me
where we're going, interesting.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.417
It's uh, just... just a business meeting,

09:44.451 --> 09:45.651
just I've gotta meet a guy.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.553
Uh huh, what guy?

09:47.588 --> 09:49.922
A financial guy, it's a financial matter.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.424
Well Johnny, it's gonna
be awfully hard for me

09:51.458 --> 09:53.259
to get you to this meeting if
I don't know where we're going!

09:53.293 --> 09:55.695
I mean, why is this such a big secret?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.864
It's not a big secret, it's
not a big secret, Roland,

09:57.898 --> 09:59.799
and you're only doing 25, if
we could pick it up a little...

09:59.833 --> 10:01.400
Oh my God, now you're in such a hurry.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.202
What's the big rush here?
I don't get that, either!

10:03.237 --> 10:04.704
The office closes at
four o'clock, that's all.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.339
What office are you talking about?

10:06.373 --> 10:07.206
The financial guy that
I'm seeing, his office...

10:07.241 --> 10:08.741
What financial guy?

10:08.775 --> 10:10.977
The guy I'm doing business
with, I told you...

10:11.011 --> 10:12.545
- Where are we going?!
- The unemployment office!

10:12.579 --> 10:14.714
Okay?

10:14.748 --> 10:18.985
I'm applying for unemployment.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.887
Jeez pal, your business is your business.

10:20.921 --> 10:21.954
I don't know why you're telling me!

10:26.881 --> 10:29.381
Well, good afternoon!

10:29.520 --> 10:31.855
Everyone have a full glass, I hope?

10:31.889 --> 10:33.757
We've wanted to have you all here for ages,

10:33.791 --> 10:35.492
you've all so graciously welcomed us

10:35.526 --> 10:38.695
into your heavenly hamlet!

10:38.729 --> 10:42.098
Now, if you'll be so good as to follow me,

10:42.133 --> 10:43.533
David is setting out some hors d'oeuvres

10:43.567 --> 10:46.036
in our adjoining suite.

10:46.070 --> 10:49.339
- David! We have guests!
- (Fake gasp)

10:49.373 --> 10:51.307
You were supposed to have cleaned
up all these quality products!

10:51.342 --> 10:54.010
I must've lost track of time.

10:54.045 --> 10:57.147
Now the seating areas are
covered in Allez Vous cosmetics!

10:57.181 --> 10:59.682
I know, I just didn't want
to put such high quality

10:59.717 --> 11:03.053
paraben and paba free product on the floor!

11:03.087 --> 11:07.357
Come on in.

11:07.391 --> 11:09.893
Okay, well everything's going
super well, I can see, so...

11:09.927 --> 11:11.694
well no, come on, we've
gotta stay for a bit.

11:11.729 --> 11:13.730
No, we've made our
appearance, and now we can go.

11:13.764 --> 11:16.132
Your mom asked me to come.

11:16.167 --> 11:18.168
Well, she asked everybody to come.

11:18.202 --> 11:19.969
Can you not just say no for one time, Ted?!

11:22.640 --> 11:26.009
Jocelyn, you can hold this lip plumper.

11:26.043 --> 11:28.078
Ronnie, this is a mineral moisturizer,

11:28.112 --> 11:30.413
you could keep it on
your lap, or sample it.

11:30.448 --> 11:32.916
David, now is not the
time to discuss Allez Vous'

11:32.950 --> 11:34.818
preferred customer discounts.

11:34.852 --> 11:37.520
Oh!

11:37.555 --> 11:39.255
Actually, I think I'm going
to be getting lunch elsewhere.

11:39.290 --> 11:40.657
Can I come with you?

11:40.691 --> 11:42.258
I don't think so.

11:42.293 --> 11:45.895
Now you get all decisive-y?

11:45.930 --> 11:48.331
I was just so excited
about Allez Vous' exclusive

11:48.365 --> 11:51.935
anti-aging formula,
and rejuvenation serums.

11:51.969 --> 11:53.837
Alexis, you'd like this product.

11:53.871 --> 11:56.039
It's all about aging, and dry skin.

11:56.073 --> 11:58.541
Oh my God, ew, David!

11:58.576 --> 12:00.677
David, I know you're excited to be part

12:00.711 --> 12:03.012
of the fastest growing
multilevel marketing community

12:03.047 --> 12:06.950
on the continent, but honestly!

12:06.984 --> 12:08.384
There's something wrong with your face.

12:08.419 --> 12:10.987
With my face?

12:11.021 --> 12:12.956
Well, if any of you do
happen to have questions

12:12.990 --> 12:15.191
about the products,

12:15.226 --> 12:18.995
or how to make up to
600,000 dollars a year,

12:19.029 --> 12:22.398
I suppose I'd be willing to
share with you what I know.

12:28.472 --> 12:31.641
In the meantime, please, eat, drink,

12:31.675 --> 12:34.511
to your possible beauty!

12:34.545 --> 12:36.312
(Phone rings)

12:36.347 --> 12:38.314
How can I help you today, sir?

12:38.349 --> 12:40.083
Uh, yes, Johnny Rose, I have an
appointment to get some money.

12:40.117 --> 12:42.252
Get some money?

12:42.286 --> 12:45.088
I need a cheque, preferably today.

12:45.122 --> 12:46.723
Ideally in the next few minutes,

12:46.757 --> 12:48.858
'cause I have somebody waiting in the car.

12:48.893 --> 12:52.228
(Chuckles) Well, we
don't just give out money.

12:52.263 --> 12:53.997
First we need some information.

12:54.031 --> 12:55.999
Oh yeah, sure, yeah. Hm-hm.

12:56.033 --> 12:58.902
- Your name?
- Johnny Rose.

12:58.936 --> 13:01.304
- Last employer?
- Johnny Rose.

13:01.338 --> 13:02.639
And how long did you work for yourself?

13:02.673 --> 13:06.075
All my life.

13:06.110 --> 13:08.945
And your reason for being out of work?

13:08.979 --> 13:12.749
I sold my business, and I got
screwed by my business manager.

13:12.783 --> 13:15.218
Did you pay into unemployment insurance?

13:15.252 --> 13:17.954
I don't know, maybe I did, maybe I didn't,

13:17.988 --> 13:21.958
it never came across my desk, I uh...

13:21.992 --> 13:26.930
We can't give you money unless
you contributed to the program.

13:26.964 --> 13:28.565
I don't think you're understanding,

13:28.599 --> 13:32.001
I employed people, hundreds of people.

13:32.036 --> 13:34.470
You see, and now I'm unemployed.

13:34.505 --> 13:37.040
But that doesn't mean you
qualify for unemployment.

13:37.074 --> 13:38.508
I lost my job!

13:38.542 --> 13:40.243
You lost your business.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.779
Okay, let me walk you through this.

13:42.813 --> 13:45.949
You see, I need money
to get back on my feet

13:45.983 --> 13:48.651
so I can employ more people,

13:48.686 --> 13:50.787
that might actually end up
saving you money in the long run

13:50.821 --> 13:52.322
now, am I the only one who understands

13:52.356 --> 13:53.990
how an economy works around here?!

13:54.024 --> 13:56.659
Let me walk you through this, Mr. Rose.

13:56.694 --> 13:59.495
Unless you can prove that you
contributed, you don't qualify.

13:59.530 --> 14:01.197
If you were laid off, or fired,

14:01.232 --> 14:02.465
or could show that you
were out looking for work,

14:02.499 --> 14:04.100
that would be a different story.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.568
I'd like to talk to
your supervisor, please.

14:05.603 --> 14:08.471
I am the supervisor.

14:08.505 --> 14:12.008
And, may I say, doing a fantastic job.

14:14.678 --> 14:19.148
And who's interested?

14:19.183 --> 14:21.684
Well, it doesn't look like
anybody's really interested.

14:21.719 --> 14:23.686
Get out!

14:23.721 --> 14:29.325
I know someone here wants in
on this exclusive opportunity!

14:29.360 --> 14:31.227
Moira, honey, that Champagne
Audi is really hard to get.

14:31.262 --> 14:33.930
Excuse me?

14:33.964 --> 14:36.132
Take it from me, Roland and
I have been Allez Vous reps

14:36.166 --> 14:39.969
for two years, and we're
still driving that old truck.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.606
Sorry, you're... you're
an Allez Vous consultant?

14:43.641 --> 14:46.276
I'm actually an executive area manager.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.645
I'm a district manager.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.546
I'm an executive district manager.

14:50.581 --> 14:51.781
I gave up.

14:51.815 --> 14:54.150
What?!

14:54.184 --> 14:55.685
The Allez Vous craze hit
the town a couple years ago,

14:55.719 --> 14:57.754
and you should've seen us!

14:57.788 --> 14:59.522
In two weeks we had sold everything

14:59.556 --> 15:01.424
to the other half of town, and vice versa.

15:01.458 --> 15:04.193
That's... that's funny.

15:04.228 --> 15:07.530
It became a bit incestuous,
yeah, very small sales pool.

15:07.564 --> 15:10.833
It became literally
impossible to climb the ladder.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.836
Anywho, good luck!

15:18.809 --> 15:21.144
Somehow, we got off on the wrong foot.

15:21.178 --> 15:24.580
Okay? So if I in any way
gave you the impression that-

15:24.615 --> 15:26.616
I am locking up now, Mr. Rose.

15:26.650 --> 15:27.250
Johnny, how long is this gonna take,

15:27.284 --> 15:29.819
'cause I got a couple-

15:29.853 --> 15:31.954
Roland?

15:31.989 --> 15:35.792
Well Marnie, hello. How are you?

15:35.826 --> 15:37.927
Haven't seen you in a while.

15:37.961 --> 15:41.731
Yeah, it has been a while, hasn't it?

15:41.765 --> 15:44.667
Marnie and I were, um, how shall I say it?

15:44.702 --> 15:47.603
"Close friends" in high school.

15:47.638 --> 15:49.038
Isn't that right, Marnie?

15:49.073 --> 15:51.074
Okay, that's enough of that.

15:51.108 --> 15:52.828
(Chuckles) Marnie likes the bad boys.

15:52.843 --> 15:55.111
Roland!

15:55.145 --> 15:56.679
Are you taking care of
my bad boy over there?

15:56.714 --> 15:58.281
No, she's being quite obstinate
about this whole situation.

15:58.315 --> 16:00.817
I'm getting nothing!

16:00.851 --> 16:02.985
Well, unfortunately,
Mr. Rose doesn't qualify

16:03.020 --> 16:05.922
for unemployment because
he's never had a job.

16:05.956 --> 16:07.357
Oh well, didn't he tell you about the job

16:07.391 --> 16:09.826
- he was doing for me?
- No, what job?

16:09.860 --> 16:12.395
You didn't tell her?

16:12.429 --> 16:15.832
No-no, not
specifically, I-I-uh...

16:15.866 --> 16:17.500
Well, that's important
information, Mr. Rose.

16:17.534 --> 16:19.569
You working for Roland
makes you an employee.

16:19.603 --> 16:22.405
- Yes!
- Oh! I forgot.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.041
Well, what were your duties?

16:25.075 --> 16:27.477
Well, I was in more of
a consulting position.

16:27.511 --> 16:30.346
Oh! (Laughs) No, no, no, no, no.

16:30.381 --> 16:32.615
It was not a consulting
position, he was my assistant,

16:32.649 --> 16:34.083
he was like my little guy Friday.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.685
He would fetch things for me,

16:35.719 --> 16:37.487
I'd tell him where to go
and he'd go running off,

16:37.521 --> 16:39.188
and fetching things for me.

16:39.223 --> 16:40.890
What were some of the things you fetched?

16:40.924 --> 16:43.359
- You fetched like uh...
- Coffee.

16:43.394 --> 16:45.294
- Coffee, you'd get that, and um...
- I get his coffee...

16:45.329 --> 16:47.797
- Sometimes you'd have to...
- Get a hankie.

16:47.831 --> 16:50.299
- No, you'd pick up, you know...
- Cleaning, his dry cleaning.

16:50.334 --> 16:51.534
- Yeah, you'd have to do that, and then...
- Just when he didn't have time.

16:51.568 --> 16:53.302
How about these guys down
there, those are boots.

16:53.337 --> 16:54.437
Nothing with the boots,
I don't think there was-

16:54.471 --> 16:55.805
Oh, there was something with the boots.

16:55.839 --> 16:57.573
Polish them every once in a while.

16:57.608 --> 16:59.208
Every now and then, he had to do that, too.

16:59.243 --> 17:02.211
He was a hell of a worker and
I really, really needed him,

17:02.246 --> 17:06.315
because you know how busy I can get.

17:06.349 --> 17:07.983
(Sly chuckle) Yes I do.

17:08.018 --> 17:11.186
(Chuckles)

17:11.221 --> 17:14.089
Yeah, unfortunately I
had to can his ass though,

17:14.124 --> 17:16.792
because of that whole
"cut the gravy" thing, so.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.929
Oh. Well...

17:19.963 --> 17:22.598
I think we can make this work.

17:22.633 --> 17:24.000
(Bell on door jingles)

17:26.904 --> 17:29.138
(Sighs)

17:29.173 --> 17:32.008
Hey... I come in peace.

17:32.042 --> 17:34.243
What's this?

17:34.278 --> 17:37.880
I don't know, it's a pre shave
follicle mask or something,

17:37.915 --> 17:42.351
I took it from the pile of
product that nobody bought.

17:42.386 --> 17:44.120
Sweet gesture.

17:47.891 --> 17:50.092
I'm sorry for being rude.

17:50.127 --> 17:51.561
You have to understand
that you're the first

17:51.595 --> 17:53.262
nice guy that I've dated.

17:53.297 --> 17:56.332
Lex, I am not always nice.

17:56.366 --> 17:57.966
I just really want my family to like you.

17:57.968 --> 18:00.136
They don't like me?

18:00.170 --> 18:02.538
No, they do! They do, they've just
always seen nice as a sign of weakness,

18:02.573 --> 18:04.307
they take advantage of nice.

18:04.341 --> 18:07.844
No, nice does not always mean weak, it's...

18:07.878 --> 18:11.914
Okay, so get mad, then.

18:11.949 --> 18:14.417
Say something super mean.

18:14.451 --> 18:18.421
What, I can't just turn it on
in an instant, like you can.

18:18.455 --> 18:22.825
Okay well, consider it
a kind of role play then,

18:22.860 --> 18:25.528
and just let it out.

18:25.562 --> 18:29.799
I-I don't know...

18:29.833 --> 18:32.835
I find your brother can be a
little pretentious sometimes.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.670
Yes, yes!

18:34.705 --> 18:37.039
He is so pretentious, and it is so gross.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.374
This is good, keep going.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.910
Well, and your mother...

18:40.944 --> 18:43.513
Seems to be a little uninformed at times.

18:43.547 --> 18:46.382
She's uninformed most of the time.

18:46.416 --> 18:47.776
This is great, this is really good.

18:47.784 --> 18:49.352
Keep going!

18:49.386 --> 18:51.053
Well, and you, what about you?

18:51.088 --> 18:52.188
Are you just going to sit around all day,

18:52.222 --> 18:53.523
while I work and buy you dinners?

18:53.557 --> 18:55.491
You've gotta go out there and get a job...

18:55.526 --> 18:56.926
- Too far.
- Mm-hmm.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.462
- It's too far, okay.
- That's too far.

18:59.496 --> 19:01.931
All right, and there we go.

19:01.965 --> 19:04.400
- Boy, thank you!
- Oh, stop it.

19:04.434 --> 19:08.838
No, no, Roland, I-I owe you big.

19:08.872 --> 19:12.508
Well um, one day, and
that day may never come,

19:12.543 --> 19:15.311
I may call upon you to perform a function.

19:15.345 --> 19:16.779
Marlon Brando!

19:16.813 --> 19:19.248
Yes, but from what movie?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.684
The Godfather.

19:21.718 --> 19:23.553
No, it's the one where
he's the big mafia guy.

19:23.587 --> 19:25.855
The Godfather!

19:25.889 --> 19:28.224
Hold on a second, I'll think of it.

19:28.258 --> 19:31.961
Anyway, I appreciate what you've
done, Roland, I really do, I'm-

19:31.995 --> 19:34.263
Don't you worry about it,
Johnny, I'm happy to do it.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.566
Why don't you just get
me a little wiper fluid,

19:36.600 --> 19:38.234
and we'll call it even, okay?

19:38.268 --> 19:39.802
Okay, wiper fluid, you got it.

19:39.836 --> 19:41.270
And also maybe a Kleenex caddy?

19:41.305 --> 19:42.905
I've always wanted one of those.

19:42.940 --> 19:44.373
That's funny!

19:44.408 --> 19:46.542
It is, but I'm not joking.

19:46.577 --> 19:49.879
All right, one Kleenex
caddy, and wiper fluid.

19:49.913 --> 19:52.315
(Truck engine rumbles)

19:52.349 --> 19:53.683
(Engine revs, tires screech)

19:55.752 --> 19:57.119
(Engine clatters, hisses)

20:00.290 --> 20:01.757
Roland, you screwed it up!

20:03.927 --> 20:05.127
Roland!

20:06.630 --> 20:08.030
Roland!

20:10.200 --> 20:13.134
Son of a bitch!

20:16.497 --> 20:19.265
Oh Johnny, I told you not
to take 'er on the highway.

20:19.898 --> 20:21.866
Yeah, I'm sorry, Bob,

20:21.900 --> 20:25.069
I guess I took one of those
left turns, and uh, yeah.

20:25.104 --> 20:27.305
Okay, well, let's get 'er hooked up,

20:27.339 --> 20:29.674
get you back to the garage,

20:29.708 --> 20:30.875
and we'll start on the paperwork.

20:30.909 --> 20:33.711
What paperwork?

20:33.745 --> 20:36.681
It's all filled in, you just
have to sign it, and uh...

20:36.715 --> 20:38.649
She's all yours!

20:38.684 --> 20:40.251
I'm not buying this car!

20:40.285 --> 20:42.019
You change your mind?

20:42.054 --> 20:45.223
It broke, twice! It's a broken car!

20:45.257 --> 20:46.991
We'll play a little hardball, okay.

20:47.025 --> 20:49.627
I'll knock twenty bucks off.

20:49.661 --> 20:51.221
You couldn't get twenty bucks for scrap!

20:51.230 --> 20:53.097
Oh! (Laughs)

20:53.132 --> 20:54.966
All right, thirty bucks!

20:55.000 --> 20:56.801
How about zero bucks?!

20:56.835 --> 20:58.369
I wouldn't give you a dime for this!

20:58.403 --> 20:59.971
Johnny, you're killing me here!

21:00.005 --> 21:01.839
Fifty bucks!

21:01.874 --> 21:06.043
Oh, you know what, Bob,
I'm walking. I'm walking!

21:06.078 --> 21:07.879
I'll throw in a couple of floor mats,

21:07.913 --> 21:09.080
but that's my final offer!

21:09.114 --> 21:09.780
Walking!

21:09.782 --> 21:16.621
Hey!

21:16.623 --> 21:17.889
I said bring

21:17.891 --> 21:18.990
the goddamn diaper bag!

21:18.992 --> 21:20.124
Have you seen that couple

21:20.126 --> 21:20.958
that checked in?

21:20.960 --> 21:21.993
They're my cousins.

21:21.995 --> 21:22.827
Oh.

21:22.829 --> 21:23.794
John, you're speaking

21:23.796 --> 21:24.896
at the funeral?

21:24.898 --> 21:26.264
Nothing says we'll miss you

21:26.266 --> 21:27.266
like an excerpt

21:27.267 --> 21:28.399
from Breaking Dawn.
