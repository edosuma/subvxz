THE ELEMENT
OF SURPRISE.

20:01.958 --> 20:04.125
I DON'T LIKE THIS,
EDDY.

20:04.208 --> 20:06.792
AREN'T THEY CUTE?

20:13.167 --> 20:15.208
SHOULD'VE THOUGHT
OF THIS BEFORE.

20:15.292 --> 20:16.750
HUH-HUH!

20:17.792 --> 20:20.250
I THINK THEY'RE TRYING

I THINK THAT WAS
THE LAST BALLOON, EDDY.

20:44.708 --> 20:47.708
YOU'RE FINISHED
NOW, KANKERS!

20:47.792 --> 20:48.417
UH-OH!

20:48.500 --> 20:50.458
I THINK
I MISCOUNTED.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.917
UH-OH.

20:54.292 --> 20:55.542

SORRY ABOUT THAT,
EDDY.

21:18.667 --> 21:20.833

21:34.667 --> 21:35.375
Ed: EDDY!

21:35.458 --> 21:37.083
HE FELL IN THIS
DIRECTION.

21:37.167 --> 21:39.250
EDDY,
WHERE ARE YOU?

21:40.167 --> 21:42.000
HE LOOKS
UNCONSCIOUS.

21:44.083 --> 21:47.583
HE DON'T LOOK
TOO GOOD, DOUBLE-D.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.583
WAKE UP, EDDY!

21:49.667 --> 21:52.125
STOP BEING
UNCONSCIOUS NOW!

21:54.458 --> 21:56.208
I'M AWAKE!

21:57.167 --> 21:59.500
YOU KNOW, IT WAS PRETTY COOL
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.

21:59.583 --> 22:00.667
IF WE COULD
BUILD A CATAPULT,

22:00.750 --> 22:03.292
WE COULD SHOOT PEOPLE
OUT OF IT FOR MONEY.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.125
