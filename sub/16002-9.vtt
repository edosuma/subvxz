[Bridget] I thought if you knew
about me and your father

00:04.500 --> 00:07.500
that you would never see
me in a romantic way again.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.166
You're right, I won't.

- Deena.

it's just that my husband...

There are things you can do
to bring the labor on.

Oh, yeah. I heard about
a salad dressing at a restaurant
by the ocean

02:08.333 --> 02:11.458
- that can start
your contractions.
- Oh, right.

it's a little soon.

- Yeah.

put my sandwiches out.

04:31.959 --> 04:36.291
Yeah. I mean, I figured you're

- Well, I'm not
sure I can do that.
- Why not?

05:16.959 --> 05:20.000
He never does the right thing.
He's supposed to be the dad.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.208
He's not supposed to
date the girl I date.

05:22.208 --> 05:23.875

have a lot in common and
I need to sit. Come on.

05:41.458 --> 05:45.500
They're awful. They have labels.

"tofurella?"

- Yummy goodness is what it is.

There's this sweet sandwich lady
at work who sells them.

What is your problem?

a new one. A BLG.

salty/sweet thing.

Waffles and syrup.

I wanted to ask you and...

06:50.000 --> 06:52.208
You have any plain
ham and cheese?

06:52.208 --> 06:55.417
The damage was minimal, the
injuries to all parties minor,

06:55.417 --> 06:58.709
and due to the emotional duress
both defendants were under,

06:58.709 --> 07:01.458
- I ask the court's leniency.
- Thank you. [snorts]

07:01.458 --> 07:03.000
After reviewing the facts,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.333
I think it's appropriate for
your clients to perform 50 hours

07:06.333 --> 07:09.500
of community service
in the next four weeks.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.083
- Fifty hours?
- Shh!

07:11.083 --> 07:14.208
What was that, Mr... Davis?

07:14.208 --> 07:18.375
Nothing. Nothing, Your Honor.
He does that sometimes.
Blurts things out.

07:18.375 --> 07:21.583
- I'd like to hear
from Mr. Davis.
- Oh, this is gonna be bad.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.417
Uh... [clears throat]

07:24.458 --> 07:26.583
We paid for the damages,
Your Honor.

07:26.583 --> 07:29.083
No one was hurt.
It was just a dumb bar fight.

07:29.083 --> 07:32.834
Fifty does seem... excessive.

07:34.625 --> 07:38.208
And what do you feel would be
more appropriate? [snorts]

07:38.208 --> 07:42.625
What do your years of legal
expertise suggest, Mr. Davis?

07:44.125 --> 07:45.208
Uh...

07:46.959 --> 07:49.417
Fifty. Fifty sounds great.

Really. I'm interested to hear
your thoughts. [snorts]

Well, with all due respect,
Your Honor, I'd say around...

08:00.959 --> 08:03.417
...thirty?
That seems fair to me.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.834
Well, then, thirty it is.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.583
OK then, we have a deal on the
table.

08:11.583 --> 08:14.583
- Four weeks to do 30 hours.
- Nice try, counselor.

08:14.583 --> 08:17.792
I'm gonna grant your request
for 30 hours of service.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.166
- To be completed in four days.
- What?

08:20.166 --> 08:24.542
- Well, that's impossible.
- You fail to do that,
I'll double it.

Now get out of here.

08:27.208 --> 08:30.166
- [Jimmy] I told you
not to talk.
- He kept asking questions.

08:30.166 --> 08:32.875
He was making sounds with his
nose. He threw me off my game.

08:32.875 --> 08:35.750
I can't do 30 hours.
I have the Jensen case.

I can't screw this up.
- You can do an overnight.

it's just dinner.

Worst case scenario,
you have no connection.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.375

and you're home in two hours.

11:38.375 --> 11:42.000
- Yeah.
- OK. Thanks.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.375
So what do you think
they have in this stuff?

11:44.375 --> 11:47.875
A lot of oil,
some mustard and anchovy bits.

11:47.875 --> 11:51.834
- OK, well, here goes.
- No!

11:51.834 --> 11:54.709
Honey, you're not
supposed to drink it!

11:54.709 --> 11:57.542
Oh! Maybe it'll work faster.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.875
The firm wants you to
settle this out of court.
Quietly. No PR.

12:02.542 --> 12:05.291

Gentlemen, thank you for coming.
I'm Adam Hillman.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.500

- Hi.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.750
I am sorry about your father.
I can't imagine what you must
be experiencing.

12:16.750 --> 12:19.375
Yes, well, Mr. Miller's ordeal

12:19.375 --> 12:23.375
has been, and continues to be,
uh, quite formidable.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.583
Well, after a careful review
of the files here, it seems...

12:26.583 --> 12:28.458
My dad was a pretty healthy guy.

12:28.458 --> 12:31.875
But after the accident
at the factory...

12:33.417 --> 12:35.417
He hasn't walked in over a year.

12:36.750 --> 12:40.250
Workers comp won't pay
because the company is saying

12:40.250 --> 12:43.250
that it was operator error.

12:43.250 --> 12:47.583
Bills are huge.
I just need a little help.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.250
Well, moving right along...

and future costs,

13:24.291 --> 13:26.458

staring at me right now?

13:26.458 --> 13:28.792

13:28.792 --> 13:31.458

- Oh, I will.

- Girl. We call her
"Sandwich Girl."
- You gonna ask her out?

13:48.625 --> 13:51.125
- Why? Should I?
- Dave, she waved. She smiled.

13:51.125 --> 13:54.500
It's called flirting, look into
it. What are you waiting for?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.333

a little out of my league?

13:57.333 --> 13:59.792
- Maybe. But so's Deena.
- You're hilarious.

confidence. Go.

the other Tuesday and I have
a date, too.

OK, so, uh, what can we do?

swinging on our swing set?

She's trying to force labor.

if we just got a sitter?

14:59.500 --> 15:02.458

and we were going out,

15:02.458 --> 15:06.000

get Maria anyway.

what people do.

me asking you for advice.

- I figured, you're a woman,

15:27.083 --> 15:29.750
and nobody knows me better
than you, right?

15:29.750 --> 15:33.709
- So I thought
maybe you could...
- I don't know. Um...

15:35.417 --> 15:38.750
Just be yourself.
Keep it simple.

a date, and I'm still not
in labor.

that always got me to go
into labor.

and on part of the trip
I went to Chicago to see my mom.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.917
Except... she wasn't there.

24:50.750 --> 24:55.792
I drove out to surprise her
and... there were strangers
in the house.

24:55.792 --> 24:57.625
The house I grew up in.

24:57.625 --> 25:01.709
And she never even told you she
was leaving? Your own mother?

25:01.709 --> 25:03.875
I'm sure she was
gonna tell me, but...

25:03.875 --> 25:08.291
These people in the house,
they had a forwarding address
in Mexico.

25:08.291 --> 25:10.000
Mom?

25:12.542 --> 25:17.166
Oh, Brian. Oh, thank God.
I thought you'd never...

25:17.166 --> 25:20.000
Come? What are you doing here?
I went home and...

25:20.000 --> 25:22.500
I am so sorry,
that must've been weird for you.

25:22.500 --> 25:27.041
You must've felt like you were
in the Twilight Zone. I just had
to sell it.

25:27.041 --> 25:30.458
It was way too big for just me,
and the upkeep...

25:30.458 --> 25:33.375
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, you have your own life,

25:33.375 --> 25:38.000
and I was going to tell you,
but I just wanted to feel free
for a while.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.667
- Free?
- Yeah.

25:40.667 --> 25:44.208
- You can understand
that, can't you?
- Mom, I've been worried.

25:44.208 --> 25:47.208
I... drove for days, Mom.

25:47.208 --> 25:51.000
You are so handsome.
My handsome boy.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.250
But you know what? You need a
haircut. You've got to see Gita.

25:54.250 --> 25:58.709
She doesn't speak English,
but she's fabulous and she
won't accept tips.

25:58.709 --> 26:00.834
Mom, are you OK? Really.

26:01.792 --> 26:03.458
How do I look?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.375
- Beautiful.
- Of course I do.

26:12.917 --> 26:15.709
Brian, dude, uh,
I need you to cover for me.

26:15.709 --> 26:19.709
- What are you talking about?
- Well, there's something
I gotta do.

26:19.709 --> 26:21.834
But if Hal asks,
just tell him that I...

26:21.834 --> 26:24.041
- Make something up.
- You cannot leave.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.750
- Gonna get us in trouble.
- I've been doing the work.

26:26.750 --> 26:29.250
- You've been sitting
talking to...
- Bridget.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.333
Bridget? Bridget Bridget?

26:32.417 --> 26:35.417
We've got a lot
to talk about. But later.

26:35.417 --> 26:37.125
Adam! Adam!

26:39.250 --> 26:40.583
That's Adam.

26:44.417 --> 26:48.917
Wow. This is San Francisco.

26:51.625 --> 26:53.875
- Just so you know...
- So what did they...

26:53.875 --> 26:55.458
I'm sorry. You go.

26:55.458 --> 26:59.750
I was gonna say...
that I don't do this very often.

26:59.750 --> 27:02.458
Really? Gosh. Me neither.

27:02.458 --> 27:05.291
I know. That's why I like you.

27:05.291 --> 27:08.166
Why? Because going out
to dinner for me

27:08.166 --> 27:10.959
is sitting on the porch
with my girls eating pizza?

27:10.959 --> 27:13.959
- No. Because you're so real.
- Hmm.

27:15.083 --> 27:17.166
So when does the plane leave?

27:17.166 --> 27:22.083
I mean, do you have it back
at a certain time, or how does
that even work?

27:22.083 --> 27:24.166
After dessert, after coffee...

27:25.083 --> 27:27.500
After breakfast.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.333
[music plays]

27:30.333 --> 27:32.792
I'll take that.

27:32.792 --> 27:34.542
Oh, man! That's good.

27:34.542 --> 27:36.834
So what should we do next,
besides puke?

27:36.834 --> 27:39.417
I can win you another
one of those.

27:39.417 --> 27:41.792
You win me two more,
I can give 'em to my...

27:41.792 --> 27:44.083
- Your what?
- My... My roommate.

27:44.083 --> 27:47.000
- He's got a thing for zebras.
- What?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.458
I mean giraffes.

27:50.125 --> 27:55.083
You know what? Actually,
I need to take care of
something real quick.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.333
- You OK?
- Mm-hmm.

27:58.208 --> 28:00.500
Hey, Maria, it's me.
How they doing?

28:02.041 --> 28:06.709
Really? How come
they're not that easy for me?

28:06.709 --> 28:10.083
Wait, listen. I'm gonna
be a little late tonight.
Is that OK?

28:10.083 --> 28:14.834
Yeah. Ah, thanks.
All right, bye.

28:14.834 --> 28:18.000
Hey, there you guys are.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
I was thinking
maybe we could take a picture.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Here, come on. Jump in.

28:25.375 --> 28:27.458
You are pretty cute,
you know that?

28:27.458 --> 28:30.709
Oh, I've been told I have
a Connery-esque quality.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.834
Get that money in here.

28:34.792 --> 28:36.125
OK.

28:43.250 --> 28:44.834
Wow.

28:49.792 --> 28:51.750
No, we went all over the city.

28:51.750 --> 28:54.542
She seemed like she knew
every little shopkeeper

28:54.542 --> 28:56.750
and every perfect place
to get carnitas.

28:56.750 --> 28:59.625
I mean, being with my mom
is such an adventure

28:59.625 --> 29:04.792
and so... much fun,
you let yourself forget.

29:06.750 --> 29:08.583
Forget what?

29:08.583 --> 29:10.458
Why don't we go back
to that stand

29:10.458 --> 29:13.458
and get you those socks
with the little white stripes?

29:13.458 --> 29:16.875
- Mom, I can't. Really.
- Oh, fine. Have it your way.

29:21.083 --> 29:24.125
Oh, come on, Brian.
It's not that bad.

29:27.458 --> 29:29.625
Mom, look at this place.

29:29.625 --> 29:33.792
Well, I just don't like people
coming through my room when
I'm not here.

29:33.792 --> 29:37.250
I have valuables, things that
are important to me, Brian.

29:37.250 --> 29:40.417
And I won't have strangers
touching them. I just won't.

29:41.834 --> 29:44.583
You're manic, Mom.
You're having a manic episode.

29:44.583 --> 29:48.875
- Oh, Brian, please.
Don't ruin a nice day.
- I need to take you home

29:48.875 --> 29:52.875
- and get you
back on medication.
- No. I don't need the medicine.

29:52.875 --> 29:56.792
I don't. I feel fine.
I feel great, actually.

30:01.709 --> 30:03.667
It's OK, Mom.

30:03.667 --> 30:05.291
We'll be fine, OK?

30:05.291 --> 30:08.291
[Brian] I drove her home,
checked her into the hospital

30:08.291 --> 30:10.458
and got her back
on her medicine.

30:12.792 --> 30:14.875
What's happening now?

30:14.875 --> 30:17.625
No, she's better, I think.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.834
She has her own apartment and...

30:19.834 --> 30:23.291
I talked to her this weekend
and now she's coming out
to visit.

30:25.125 --> 30:29.500
So... you get any clues about
my taste in women from that?

30:30.834 --> 30:33.625
- Actually, yes.
- Oh, why does that
not surprise me?

30:33.625 --> 30:35.333
All right, let me have it.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.625
Well, you probably pick women
who are trouble because

30:38.625 --> 30:42.083
deep inside you wanna save them.
It's the only pattern you know.

30:42.083 --> 30:45.959
Until you deal with your mom,
you're gonna keep repeating it
over and over.

30:48.250 --> 30:49.750
I was a psych major.

30:56.166 --> 31:01.083
Hi. Could I get 15
cheeseburgers, 15 fries,
and 15 large drinks.

31:01.083 --> 31:03.083
No cheese on mine.

31:03.834 --> 31:05.625
I'm lactose intolerant.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.667
Fourteen cheeseburgers
and one plain.

31:19.375 --> 31:21.917
That's a little better
than turkey, right?

31:21.917 --> 31:24.667
- Chicken.
- Whatever.

31:24.667 --> 31:28.041
Yeah... it's a pretty nice
thing you did for us.

31:28.041 --> 31:31.583
- Oh, well, no problem.
- What about tomorrow?

31:31.583 --> 31:34.208
Don't know if I can
take you guys out every night.

31:34.208 --> 31:38.375
Don't have to. But you don't
have to go back to your life
and forget everything

31:38.375 --> 31:41.542
- that happened tonight, either.
- I won't. I'll come back.

31:41.542 --> 31:44.583
No, you won't.
And that's normal.

31:46.166 --> 31:48.542
Why don't you cut me
a little slack, OK?

31:48.542 --> 31:51.542
As nice as all this is,
it's about as helpful

31:51.542 --> 31:55.667
as throwing a suitcase
off the Titanic. We're
still gonna sink eventually.

31:55.667 --> 31:59.542
Unless people start helping
without the judge telling them
they have to.

32:05.875 --> 32:09.250
Hi, you said this dinner
would take two hours.

32:09.250 --> 32:11.458
- Guess where I am?
- Home?

32:11.458 --> 32:13.709
San Francisco.

32:13.709 --> 32:16.125
As in San Francisco.

32:16.125 --> 32:19.375
He picked me up in a limo,
he took me to the airport,

32:19.375 --> 32:21.333
he flew me here
in a private plane.

32:21.333 --> 32:24.792
- Now we're having
dinner on the roof.
- Wow. That sounds amazing.

32:24.792 --> 32:28.250
- That's like a dream date.
- No, it's really uncomfortable.

32:28.250 --> 32:32.583
There's... There's no chemistry.
And now he is talking about
breakfast.

32:32.583 --> 32:36.375
I mean, am I supposed to have
sex with him because he did
all this for me?

32:36.375 --> 32:38.750
- Am I obligated?
- How big was the plane?

32:38.750 --> 32:41.500
OK, I hope your labor
lasts 30 hours.

32:41.500 --> 32:44.792
Relax. You don't have to sleep
with him if you don't want to.

32:44.792 --> 32:48.333
- Really?
- Well, it would
be polite, but no.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.500
- What are you doing?
- Not giving birth.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.583
It's come down to this.

32:53.583 --> 32:57.000
Castor oil, some herb you mix
with Yak testicles and...

32:57.000 --> 33:00.125
Wow, something to do
with my nipples.

33:00.125 --> 33:03.250
Yeah, OK, good luck with that.
I have to go, all right?

33:03.250 --> 33:05.125
I'll see you soon. I hope.

33:05.125 --> 33:08.750
- Oh, hey, hey.
Is everything OK?
- Yeah. No, everything's fine.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.458
I just think I better pass
on breakfast. OK?

33:12.458 --> 33:13.917
You don't have to stay.

33:13.917 --> 33:17.291
I don't think you're a terrible
person, so you're free to go.

33:17.291 --> 33:20.542
Yeah, maybe I should.
Those guys were looking at me

33:20.542 --> 33:22.709
like I was the only
woman for 100 miles.

33:24.375 --> 33:26.792
You thought about
what I said the other night?

33:26.792 --> 33:28.792
I have.

33:28.792 --> 33:32.333
And I think you're great,

33:32.333 --> 33:36.291
and smart, and really,
really beautiful.

33:38.125 --> 33:41.333
I get it. I do.

33:41.333 --> 33:44.667
- But we're friends, right?
- Yeah.

34:13.041 --> 34:15.166
OK, maybe a little bit.

34:24.667 --> 34:27.208
[Dave] Just don't think
that the Berlin Wall is

34:27.208 --> 34:29.667
the most important event
of the 20th century.

34:29.667 --> 34:33.041
It was a major shift in people's
perceptions of the world.

34:33.041 --> 34:36.166
Really? More than a man
walking on the moon?

34:36.166 --> 34:37.875
What?! That doesn't affect us.

34:37.875 --> 34:41.875
That wall coming down was
so much bigger than just a wall.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.458

- God, I don't wanna
say good night.
- I don't either.

Well, I just wanted to
thank you for the advice.
You know, I kept it simple.

38:00.834 --> 38:03.291
It was fun.
We went to an arcade.

38:04.375 --> 38:05.709
That sounds like fun.

38:05.709 --> 38:08.291
Yeah, it was. We played
video games all night.

38:08.291 --> 38:11.417
- Ate funnel cake.
- Sounds like the
perfect date for you.

38:11.417 --> 38:13.750
Know what? It kinda was.
It was a good time.

38:13.750 --> 38:17.125
I don't know, there...
There was this connection
between us.

38:17.125 --> 38:19.417
- OK, you know what?
Dave, I get it.
- What?

38:19.417 --> 38:23.458
Look, Dave, I know
what we talked about,

38:23.458 --> 38:25.625
and I know that
when some people break up,

38:25.625 --> 38:28.166
they try really hard
to be friends,

38:28.166 --> 38:31.458
you know, to be together,
like nothing's changed.

38:31.458 --> 38:35.500
But things have changed.
And, uh...

38:35.500 --> 38:38.458
I don't wanna give you
advice about dating. You know?

38:38.458 --> 38:40.959
- It's hard for me.
- OK.

38:40.959 --> 38:43.875
So I think that, maybe,
just for now, I think...

38:45.250 --> 38:47.250
I think we shouldn't
talk for a while.

38:48.417 --> 38:50.458
Not talk? It's a little...

38:50.458 --> 38:52.625
I mean, we gotta
talk about the kids.

38:52.625 --> 38:55.166
Yes, of course, we
will, obviously.

38:55.166 --> 38:59.000
But I just don't think
we should do this kind of thing.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.083
I just... I can't.

39:00.083 --> 39:03.166
Here you go.
Is that what you want?

39:03.166 --> 39:05.166
OK?

39:05.166 --> 39:07.125
Hi.

39:07.125 --> 39:12.250
I tried everything.
[sighs] Two hours
on a swing set, hiking,

39:12.250 --> 39:16.000
castor oil,
this awful salad dressing.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.166
- At the restaurant
at the ocean?
- Yeah!

39:18.166 --> 39:20.709
I can still feel it on my teeth.
It was horrible.

39:20.709 --> 39:24.542
If you don't go into labor
by next week, I'll induce.

39:24.542 --> 39:29.333
Next week? Oh, no. I don't...
I don't think I can take it.

39:29.333 --> 39:32.166
- Why won't she come out?
- You better get used to it.

39:32.166 --> 39:35.333
You'll be fighting
plenty as soon as
she's out of the womb.

39:35.333 --> 39:38.625
I have two girls.
A three-year old and a teenager.

39:38.625 --> 39:42.291
It doesn't change,
unfortunately.
Neither one listens to me.

39:42.291 --> 39:47.083
- My mother says it's karma.
- Karma?

39:47.083 --> 39:49.834
I hope you were nicer to
your mom than I was to mine.
