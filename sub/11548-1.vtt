00:16.140 --> 00:22.730
THE WIND RISES

00:23.273 --> 00:30.738
The wind is rising!
We must try to live.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.632
Here it is.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.848
May I borrow it?

05:08.182 --> 05:10.684
- It's in English.
- I have a dictionary.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.353
- Very good. Give it a go.
- Thank you.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.041
- Knock it off.
- Butt out!

05:34.333 --> 05:35.709
Better get going.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.544
Jiro...

05:38.463 --> 05:40.172
No more bullying, okay?

05:57.648 --> 06:00.358
You look quite the hero.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.736
I slipped and fell.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.239
- Fighting is never justified.
- I know.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.493
Go have your snack.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.244
Thank you.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.415
Big brother, you're back!

06:17.001 --> 06:20.879
I was waiting for you.
Let's pick bamboo grass.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.882
Big brother!

06:26.969 --> 06:29.429
I want to pick bamboo grass.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.603
You promised to go with me.

06:36.771 --> 06:37.979
I've got homework.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.196
That's not homework.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.739
It's an English magazine.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.744
What a stupid moustache.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.789
He's a famous Italian aircraft designer.

06:56.082 --> 07:00.627
His name is Caproni.
It says he's a count.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.922
- Your face is scratched.
- Leave it alone.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.758
I better put some iodine on it.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.802
Would you be quiet?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.982
Big brother, what are you doing?

07:22.191 --> 07:23.817
You're not allowed up here.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.485
You're not wearing glasses.

07:25.611 --> 07:29.990
Focusing on the stars
should improve my eyesight.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.661
- Mother will scold you.
- A shooting star!

07:36.038 --> 07:37.747
There's another one.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.335
They're pretty.
See? Like that.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.839
There's so many of them.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.045
I'm a Japanese boy.

08:30.092 --> 08:33.345
I think this is my dream.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.405
This is my dream, you know.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.324
It's mine too.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.909
Your dream?

08:56.077 --> 09:00.580
Listen, Japanese boy.
You think we are sharing this dream?

09:00.957 --> 09:01.915
It's strange.

09:02.083 --> 09:06.419
You're Count Caproni, aren't you?
I'm very glad to meet you.

09:07.755 --> 09:12.092
Interesting. Yes, this is a dream.
This world is a dream.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.094
Welcome to my kingdom.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.762
I'm honored.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.765
Look at them.

09:24.021 --> 09:28.024
They will bomb the enemy city.
Most of them won't return.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.284
But the war will soon be over.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.128
Climb up, Japanese boy.

09:50.089 --> 09:54.843
This is my dream.
When the war is over, I will build this.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.763
Magnificent, isn't she?

09:59.765 --> 10:00.807
Let's fly.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.564
Instead of bombs,
she'll carry passengers.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.492
Of course we can't climb up here...

10:19.702 --> 10:22.662
but dreams are convenient.
One can go anywhere.

10:30.254 --> 10:33.882
Come, join me.
You can walk along the spar.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.180
Take a look.

11:15.383 --> 11:19.219
- She's beautiful, no?
- Yes, incredible.

11:23.724 --> 11:27.477
She'll carry a hundred people
across the Atlantic.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.731
Mr. Caproni?
I have a question.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.236
Do you think I could
design airplanes?

11:38.656 --> 11:41.741
I'll never be a pilot.
I'm too nearsighted.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.412
Listen, Japanese boy.

11:45.621 --> 11:48.915
I'm not a pilot.
I don't even know how to fly.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.919
To fly airplanes is simple.

11:53.337 --> 11:57.674
But I am a creator of airplanes.
An aeronautical engineer!

11:58.217 --> 11:59.217
Yes!

11:59.468 --> 12:01.594
Listen to me, Japanese boy.

12:01.804 --> 12:06.099
Airplanes are not tools for war.
They are not for making money.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.768
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.

12:08.936 --> 12:12.063
Engineers turn dreams into reality.

12:12.606 --> 12:13.565
Yes!

12:13.858 --> 12:16.693
Arrivederci. We'll meet again.

12:30.749 --> 12:33.960
Jiro, you should go to bed.

12:35.129 --> 12:39.799
You startled me.
I heard you talking to someone.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.303
Mother, I'm going to be
an aeronautical engineer.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.306
Really? That's a wonderful dream.

12:46.765 --> 12:50.059
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
That's what he told me.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.604
I want to design beautiful airplanes.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.968
You, there.
Come, take my seat.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.178
Pardon me.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.429
Please.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.717
The wind feels wonderful.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.637
Miss, you'll lose your hat.

14:07.805 --> 14:08.888
Don't worry, Kinu.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.898
Watch out!

14:22.236 --> 14:23.236
Are you all right?

14:23.487 --> 14:25.029
Safe!

14:25.531 --> 14:26.864
Nice play.

14:27.908 --> 14:28.950
Thank you.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.244
"Le vent se lève."

14:33.247 --> 14:35.081
"Il faut tenter de vivre."

14:59.481 --> 15:03.234
"Le vent se lève.
Il faut tenter de vivre."

15:04.028 --> 15:07.614
"The wind is rising.
We must try to live."

16:01.085 --> 16:02.126
Earthquake.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.389
The boiler's going to blow!

17:06.483 --> 17:08.358
- What's wrong?
- Her leg.

17:08.609 --> 17:09.694
Show me.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.030
It hurts.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.490
Kinu, be brave.

17:14.657 --> 17:17.285
It's broken.
She can't walk like this.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.538
Miss, the boiler.
Please save yourself.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.205
That's nonsense.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.877
Nothing's going to explode.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.380
My suitcase.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.097
Now, try to relax.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.897
She can't walk.
Where do you live?

17:46.023 --> 17:48.566
- In Ueno.
- I'll get you there.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.247
- Fire.
- Let's go.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.349
- What about your luggage?
- It's not important.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.290
I'm so sorry.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.792
Hang on!

18:58.095 --> 18:59.345
We'd better hurry.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.517
One of my shirts.
It's brand new.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.185
You must be thirsty.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.151
The well's almost dry.
What about you?

19:55.319 --> 19:56.402
Thank you.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.535
The fire hasn't reached Ueno.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.246
I'm heading for the university.
What about you?

20:07.414 --> 20:09.415
I'll bring someone from home.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.751
I'll go with you.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.712
- Look after this, Kinu.
- I will.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.131
We'll be back soon.
Don't worry.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.508
Watch my suitcase.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.676
- Thank you.
- I'll leave her to you.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.678
But what's your name?

21:50.434 --> 21:53.019
That was some guy.
Don't you think, Kinu?

22:11.246 --> 22:13.664
Jiro! You picked a great day
to come back.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.374
How bad is it, Honjo?

22:15.584 --> 22:18.044
The whole east side is burning.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.465
That's everything we could carry.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.008
Got a smoke?

22:29.556 --> 22:33.517
A flying door? That's just great.
They'll never stop the fire now.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.352
Tokyo's finished.

22:49.785 --> 22:53.871
He really built it.
Caproni has giant dreams.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.475
Stop the camera!

24:04.901 --> 24:07.278
The wind's shifting.
It's coming this way.

24:10.574 --> 24:14.243
Is the wind still rising,
Japanese boy?

24:14.703 --> 24:17.288
Yes, it's a gale.

24:18.081 --> 24:21.417
Then you must live.
"Le vent se lève."

24:21.585 --> 24:23.961
"II faut tenter de vivre."

25:23.563 --> 25:25.356
Hey Jiro. Ready?

25:28.068 --> 25:31.111
All the new buildings
are old-fashioned.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.364
The streets are wider.

25:33.573 --> 25:35.741
Even the airplanes haven't changed.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.370
Welcome!

25:44.251 --> 25:45.918
Mackerel again?

25:46.127 --> 25:47.544
It's great.

25:47.671 --> 25:50.547
Every day's the same.
Same lunch, same lectures.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.716
Can I get an egg?

25:53.426 --> 25:56.053
The Western powers
are building all-metal aircraft.

25:57.013 --> 25:58.681
Try the pork sometime.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.684
We're more than ten years behind.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.061
What?

26:04.354 --> 26:05.604
Beautiful, isn't it?

26:06.481 --> 26:08.565
Look at that wonderful curve.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.610
You eat mackerel
to look at the bones?

26:12.195 --> 26:15.239
Come on, finish up.
We're going for coffee.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.420
Jiro sure is working hard.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.255
Fish bones.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.966
Is Mr. Horikoshi back from lunch?

26:34.175 --> 26:35.134
Jiro!

26:35.468 --> 26:37.553
Honjo, listen to this.

26:37.887 --> 26:41.932
The NACA has a standard
curve just like this bone.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.767
Do Americans eat mackerel too?

26:43.893 --> 26:46.061
Jiro, package for you.

26:47.063 --> 26:50.899
A lady brought this for you, sir.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.319
You were out,
so she left it with me.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.946
I see. Thank you.

26:57.574 --> 27:00.117
Present from your sweetheart?

27:00.327 --> 27:03.120
Got a smoke? Gimme one.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.555
- Jiro!
- Let him go.

27:46.122 --> 27:48.374
- Hello, Mr. Horikoshi.
- Back from school.

27:48.625 --> 27:52.669
Your guest is waiting.
A young lady.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.505
Oh, right.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.557
Honestly, where were you?

28:06.309 --> 28:08.060
Kayo, I'm sorry.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.312
I completely forgot.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.688
Really!

28:12.107 --> 28:14.400
- Where's Mother?
- At Uncle's.

28:14.609 --> 28:17.069
- Is she staying there?
- Just for one night.

28:17.987 --> 28:21.824
You've grown, Kayo.
And gotten very pretty, too.

28:21.991 --> 28:26.328
You're so mean.
You never ever come home.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.668
Oh, it's almost sunset already.

28:32.836 --> 28:37.214
I'll tell them I kept you.
Let's take the penny steamer.

28:39.467 --> 28:41.927
She must really like you.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.721
Come on, it's been two years.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.558
Didn't you try to see her again?

28:47.684 --> 28:50.269
Of course.
I went back once.

29:02.282 --> 29:05.075
The fire stopped at her street.

29:05.368 --> 29:06.660
See? There's the dock.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.091
Are you cold?

29:21.217 --> 29:25.304
I'm fine. I never dreamed
Tokyo would recover so quickly.

29:29.726 --> 29:32.269
Can I stay with you, Jiro?

29:32.812 --> 29:35.647
Father won't let me
live here by myself.

29:35.857 --> 29:39.651
I'll probably be in Nagoya
by the time you come.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.820
- With an airplane company?
- Yes.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.822
Men have it so good.

29:44.157 --> 29:47.576
I want to study medicine in Tokyo.

29:48.036 --> 29:51.079
A doctor? I think
you might be a good one.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.081
I think so too.

29:53.249 --> 29:55.959
I'll talk to Father
next time I'm home.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.462
Thanks. I'm counting on you.

31:04.737 --> 31:05.862
Jiro!

31:08.324 --> 31:09.533
There you are.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.076
- You made it.
- Finally.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.745
- We're on our way.
- Yes, we are.

31:32.181 --> 31:35.392
They must've been
heading for the city.

31:35.518 --> 31:37.060
There were hundreds of them.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.187
There's no work in the countryside.

31:43.693 --> 31:46.945
Another bank failure.
Which one is it this time?

31:52.285 --> 31:54.578
- Are those the customers?
- Looks like it.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.080
There were rumors.

31:57.832 --> 32:02.085
The economy's in the tank.
So is our new employer.

32:15.058 --> 32:18.894
MITSUBISHI INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINE CO.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.566
We've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?

32:25.026 --> 32:27.402
I was told to come
anytime in April.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.280
Then you should've come in March!

32:30.740 --> 32:33.241
I've got an assignment for you.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.287
It's the design for the wing strut fitting.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.791
I need it right away.
We're behind schedule already.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.963
In here.

32:48.591 --> 32:51.635
The data's ready.
This way.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.311
This is your desk.

33:01.437 --> 33:04.815
It's imported,
but no one likes it.

33:04.941 --> 33:07.192
Data here, hat goes there.

33:07.443 --> 33:10.779
Listen up! The Falcon Project
has a new engineer.

33:11.447 --> 33:14.783
He's the genius we've all
been hearing about.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.118
Introduce yourself.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.161
Jiro Horikoshi.

33:18.287 --> 33:20.330
Now get to work.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.387
Jiro, come on.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.265
It's lunchtime. Let's go.

35:04.352 --> 35:08.021
- The assembly plant?
- Yes, I'd like to take a look.

35:08.648 --> 35:13.777
Asking a green engineer to design
that fitting is practically hazing.

35:13.986 --> 35:15.153
Two.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.949
Excuse me.
Could we ask a favor?

35:19.200 --> 35:21.618
Look, it's really coming along.

35:21.744 --> 35:24.830
Sorry to bother you on your break.

35:25.081 --> 35:28.959
Not at all. You young engineers
should visit us more often.

35:29.418 --> 35:32.587
Honjo, the strut's already installed.

35:32.755 --> 35:34.089
I knew it.

35:34.257 --> 35:38.134
Kurokawa's just hazing you.
Is his fitting better than yours?

35:38.261 --> 35:40.846
Mr. Kurokawa's always hard
on new employees.

35:41.514 --> 35:44.182
Honjo, get up here
and take a look.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.309
I need your opinion.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.609
- What do you think?
- Looks strong enough.

35:54.777 --> 35:57.988
This is no good.
It's just like my design.

35:58.114 --> 35:59.865
Then it must be bad.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.200
Foreman, lunch break's over.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.827
Quiet.

36:04.203 --> 36:07.163
Fascinating! Aircraft are fascinating!

36:07.373 --> 36:09.374
Maybe they are, but we're late.

36:18.634 --> 36:19.885
I'm Hattori.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.057
Mr. Hattori is our chief engineer.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.893
Is this his first assignment?

36:28.060 --> 36:30.395
The strut fitting for the Falcon.

36:30.563 --> 36:33.565
That's no fitting.
Explain yourself, young man.

36:33.733 --> 36:37.819
Yes sir. This leaf spring
will absorb stress from the wing.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.906
The wire expands
and contracts automatically.

36:41.073 --> 36:45.243
It runs through the strut
to an anchor on the fuselage.

36:45.578 --> 36:49.080
But we'd have to
redesign the wing!

36:49.206 --> 36:52.083
You're right.
I haven't done the calculations yet.

36:52.251 --> 36:56.254
You're wasting your time.
Where's the assignment I gave you?

36:56.380 --> 36:57.589
It's finished.

37:02.637 --> 37:06.097
That looks like
a very clean design to me.

37:07.725 --> 37:08.683
It's perfect.

37:09.769 --> 37:12.062
Submit your work
as soon as you finish!

37:14.941 --> 37:18.109
- I'm heading out.
- Me too.

37:18.277 --> 37:20.946
What about Kurokawa's homework?

37:21.113 --> 37:22.280
Just finishing up.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.453
Oxen!

37:28.621 --> 37:30.872
They haul prototypes
to the airfield.

37:31.415 --> 37:35.460
The latest aircraft, hauled by oxen.
That's how backward we are.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.295
But they're wonderful creatures.

38:42.695 --> 38:43.903
Here she comes.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.031
Get ready!

38:48.993 --> 38:50.702
Approaching the mark.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.211
Damn it!

39:09.972 --> 39:13.558
- Did you get it?
- 13.3 seconds. 145 knots.

39:13.726 --> 39:16.227
Too slow.
We need ten more knots.

39:16.395 --> 39:19.564
She's too low.
The engine's not performing.

39:21.525 --> 39:22.567
Kurokawa!

39:23.069 --> 39:25.403
Representatives from the Army.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.113
An audacious design.

39:27.239 --> 39:31.076
- Another coup for Mitsubishi.
- Your Falcon is quite impressive.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.930
Power dive.
She's trying to break 200.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.956
- Parachute's open.
- Go get him!

40:33.472 --> 40:38.143
Mr. Kurokawa, we'll investigate
the cause when the weather clears.

40:38.477 --> 40:40.311
- What about the pilot?
- He's okay.

40:40.479 --> 40:41.646
That's good.

40:42.648 --> 40:46.234
Mr. Kurokawa, let's go.
We'll build Falcon Two.

40:46.986 --> 40:50.363
Do you think the strut fitting failed?

40:50.656 --> 40:55.660
No. I think the problem
is deeper and more complicated.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.663
I'll never forget what I saw today.

40:59.206 --> 41:02.167
It's like an endless road is
opening up before my eyes.

41:03.836 --> 41:05.670
There won't be a Falcon Two.

41:06.005 --> 41:09.382
The Army has decided
to go with a competing design.

41:11.010 --> 41:14.387
Today was our last chance
to change their minds.

41:15.014 --> 41:19.017
We're going to build a bomber
with help from Junkers.

41:19.476 --> 41:21.352
No more fighters for now.

41:23.689 --> 41:27.358
This is your chance to see Germany.
I've already approved it.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.438
- Still open?
- Ah, welcome back.

42:05.731 --> 42:07.899
You're later than usual.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.902
- Two slices of the usual.
- Coming up.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.744
There you are.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.913
Isn't anyone looking after them?

42:22.248 --> 42:26.918
Their parents work late.
They wait there every night.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.754
I feel bad closing the place up.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.589
I see. Well, thanks.

42:31.757 --> 42:33.091
Come again.

42:40.099 --> 42:43.601
You must be hungry.
Here's something to eat.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.604
It's sponge cake.
I just bought it.

42:58.951 --> 43:00.618
Go ahead, take it.

43:01.287 --> 43:02.453
Come on!

43:18.929 --> 43:19.971
You here, Jiro?

43:22.474 --> 43:25.977
Too bad about the Falcon.
I heard they axed it.

43:27.771 --> 43:30.982
Sponge cake? You have
some strange eating habits.

43:41.827 --> 43:43.328
What did you expect?

43:43.996 --> 43:47.749
Did you think she was going to
smile and say thank you?

43:48.167 --> 43:49.334
Of course not.

43:50.169 --> 43:53.004
Well, maybe I did.

43:53.839 --> 43:58.676
There are dozens of hungry kids
right here in this neighborhood.

43:59.636 --> 44:04.891
The cost of one fitting would feed
that kid's family for a month.

44:05.517 --> 44:08.019
Why is Japan so poor?

44:08.645 --> 44:13.691
Jiro, do you know what we're paying
the Germans for their technology?

44:13.859 --> 44:18.738
Enough to feed every kid in Japan,
with sponge cake for dessert.

44:19.156 --> 44:22.867
Still, I plan to make the most
of this opportunity.

44:23.369 --> 44:24.702
They're sending you too?

44:24.870 --> 44:26.037
They told me today.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.039
Really? That's great news.

44:28.540 --> 44:31.167
Poor countries want airplanes.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.712
So they pay us a lot
to design them. It's ironic.

44:36.048 --> 44:39.217
I'm leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
Getting married.

44:39.551 --> 44:40.676
Married?

44:40.844 --> 44:45.223
To work hard at the office,
you need a family at home.

44:45.891 --> 44:47.058
More irony.

45:22.428 --> 45:27.598
Tight-fisted Germans.
They're hardly showing us anything.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.600
I don't see any oxen.

45:29.935 --> 45:31.936
The airstrip's
next to the plant.

45:32.104 --> 45:33.938
Everything's so big.

45:56.462 --> 45:59.380
It's the G-38.
Is this what we're buying?

45:59.506 --> 46:02.800
For conversion to a bomber.
It's top secret.

46:03.260 --> 46:06.137
Who's the Army planning
to bomb with this thing?

46:06.305 --> 46:08.806
America, probably.
Not that they could.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.478
Still, it's quite something.

46:13.812 --> 46:14.854
Amazing.

46:15.772 --> 46:19.358
Passengers can sit in the wings.
This would be wasted as a bomber.

46:19.985 --> 46:24.489
Who cares? We need
their all-metal airframe technology.

46:28.660 --> 46:31.162
You're kidding.
We can't go inside?

46:59.816 --> 47:01.192
Beautiful.

47:07.699 --> 47:10.243
Stop it.
Take your hands off him.

47:10.536 --> 47:12.870
Is this how Germans
treat their guests?

47:13.038 --> 47:17.208
You Japanese copy everything.
This technology belongs to Germany.

47:17.376 --> 47:21.045
Oh, come on. Japan has
lots of planes like this.

47:21.213 --> 47:22.672
Honjo, let it go.

47:23.715 --> 47:27.051
We have a license
to your technology.

47:27.719 --> 47:32.431
We signed an agreement.
We have the right to be here.

47:32.599 --> 47:37.395
Your bosses never said
we couldn't inspect this airplane.

47:38.230 --> 47:41.232
I'm sure you're only
trying to do your job...

47:41.400 --> 47:46.571
but we won't tolerate this treatment.
The agreement is between equals.

47:47.406 --> 47:50.908
Our orders were not to let
you Japanese wander around.

48:09.386 --> 48:10.928
That's Dr. Junkers.

48:11.096 --> 48:12.930
What an engineer.

48:15.601 --> 48:18.269
You can go inside.
Dr. Junkers has agreed.

48:31.450 --> 48:33.451
I'm surprised we got a demonstration.

48:33.744 --> 48:35.620
There's more vibration
than I expected.

48:36.788 --> 48:38.873
Our bosses are getting giddy.

48:39.291 --> 48:42.293
Let the Army officers sit here.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.299
Just a moment.

48:48.467 --> 48:51.302
This is truly a stupendous aircraft.

48:52.804 --> 48:55.640
Look, a corridor through the wing.

48:57.643 --> 48:59.143
This is amazing.

49:01.146 --> 49:03.147
It's like being inside a power plant.

49:07.653 --> 49:11.322
Guten tag.
Dr. Junkers gave us permission.

49:11.490 --> 49:13.616
Please show us your work station.

49:13.784 --> 49:15.618
This is the flight engineer's station.

49:16.161 --> 49:17.662
This aircraft is marvelous.

49:19.998 --> 49:22.500
Japanese, do not go further.

49:24.628 --> 49:26.337
Of course, my friend.

49:26.797 --> 49:29.507
- This is incredible.
- Yes, it's fantastic.

49:30.342 --> 49:32.843
A triumph of
German industrial technology.

50:04.376 --> 50:08.379
Dr. Junkers is my hero,
but his company is sneaky.

50:10.549 --> 50:12.216
Got a cigarette, Jiro?

50:13.552 --> 50:14.719
Jiro!

50:16.847 --> 50:18.055
A cigarette.

50:18.348 --> 50:20.391
No. We're out.

50:37.242 --> 50:40.411
It looks cold outside,
but this room is cozy.

50:41.913 --> 50:44.081
I thought Germans used fireplaces.

50:44.916 --> 50:49.253
Junkers makes radiators too.
This almost looks like that plane.

50:49.421 --> 50:50.421
It's beautiful.

50:50.589 --> 50:54.759
And our technology is primitive.
That's what you mean, right?

50:55.427 --> 51:00.264
You think we'll never figure out
all-metal construction on our own?

51:01.433 --> 51:04.602
We can't learn anything from this.

51:04.895 --> 51:07.938
These are just pretty equations.

51:08.774 --> 51:11.609
"This technology belongs to Germany."

51:12.277 --> 51:15.613
Maybe we don't even
need their technology.

51:15.906 --> 51:18.449
Wood and canvas
could be as good as metal.

51:18.617 --> 51:22.953
Then we'll never make it.
We're already 20 years behind.

51:28.084 --> 51:29.293
Let's take a walk.

51:30.462 --> 51:32.463
My brain is boiling.

51:41.389 --> 51:44.934
We're Achilles, chasing a tortoise
with a twenty-year lead.

51:46.561 --> 51:50.272
If we close the gap
in five years...

51:50.398 --> 51:52.942
he'll be five more years
down the road.

51:53.902 --> 51:56.278
We'll always be chasing him.

51:56.404 --> 52:01.242
Someday we'll overtake him
and move ahead.

52:02.077 --> 52:05.120
I wonder if we
can be the tortoise.

52:11.920 --> 52:12.962
What?

52:16.800 --> 52:18.217
Listen to that.

52:23.431 --> 52:27.142
Schubert's "Winter Journey".
It's perfect for us.

52:50.458 --> 52:53.836
- What was that about?
- We saw him in the hangar.

53:53.355 --> 53:54.396
Jiro?

53:55.523 --> 53:58.400
I'm done. Go have a bath.

54:03.031 --> 54:04.573
Dead to the world...

54:04.866 --> 54:09.078
with a face like he's carrying
the future of Japanese aviation.

54:12.707 --> 54:14.583
There's a telegram from headquarters.

54:14.876 --> 54:16.460
- Come in.
- Not necessary.

54:16.628 --> 54:20.756
Some of us are returning immediately.
You're staying behind.

54:21.883 --> 54:24.259
Jiro will continue west
and return to Japan.

54:24.469 --> 54:27.262
- West?
- They want him to see the world.

54:27.389 --> 54:28.931
All by himself?

54:55.583 --> 54:56.792
Mr. Caproni.

54:56.918 --> 54:59.086
Is the wind still rising?

54:59.921 --> 55:01.672
Yes, it is.

55:02.090 --> 55:06.468
Then I invite you to join me
on my final flight. Come.

55:06.761 --> 55:08.470
You're retiring?

55:10.098 --> 55:11.807
It's a big jump.

55:16.104 --> 55:17.312
Jump!

55:26.906 --> 55:29.408
Hurry. We're taking off.

55:29.951 --> 55:33.412
There's a hatch under the fuselage.

55:33.621 --> 55:35.330
Hurry!

55:35.457 --> 55:36.707
Let me through.

55:36.875 --> 55:38.000
Up here!

55:46.301 --> 55:49.011
- Full power!
- Fly! Fly!

55:56.311 --> 56:01.065
My workmen's families and relatives.
Practically the whole village.

56:01.816 --> 56:03.692
We're taking a private jaunt...

56:03.818 --> 56:07.529
before we deliver this bomber
to the Air Force.

56:13.328 --> 56:16.038
- What do you think?
- It's incredible.

56:17.165 --> 56:19.541
It's like a building
out of ancient Rome.

56:20.001 --> 56:23.212
This plane is too large
to be used for war...

56:23.338 --> 56:25.756
but the Air Force
likes everything big.

56:26.508 --> 56:28.717
Japan is poor and backward.

56:29.010 --> 56:32.721
We could never build
something like this.

56:33.181 --> 56:35.849
The important thing
for an engineer is inspiration.

56:36.184 --> 56:40.604
Inspiration unlocks the future.
Technology will catch up.

56:43.525 --> 56:45.067
My wife and family.

56:45.693 --> 56:50.072
We Italians are also poor.
Too many mouths to feed.

56:55.537 --> 56:59.414
Hey, settle down.
The bottom will fall out.

57:00.375 --> 57:01.416
Come.

57:05.046 --> 57:10.259
Be careful. This may be a dream,
but you can still lose your head.

57:19.185 --> 57:24.606
Which would you choose, a world with
pyramids or one without them?

57:24.732 --> 57:26.150
Pyramids?

57:26.401 --> 57:31.113
Humanity dreams of flight,
but the dream is cursed.

57:31.239 --> 57:35.951
Aircraft are destined to become
tools for slaughter and destruction.

57:36.077 --> 57:37.119
I know.

57:37.412 --> 57:41.623
But still, I chose a world
with pyramids in it.

57:42.584 --> 57:44.626
Which world will you choose?

57:44.919 --> 57:48.130
I want to create beautiful airplanes.

57:48.256 --> 57:49.631
Like that?

58:04.939 --> 58:07.316
Very graceful.

58:07.442 --> 58:11.778
I have a long way to go.
I don't even have the engine yet.

58:20.788 --> 58:25.167
Bravo! A beautiful dream.

58:32.634 --> 58:36.011
I'm retiring.
This is my last design.

58:36.471 --> 58:39.514
Artists are only creative
for ten years.

58:39.974 --> 58:42.684
We engineers are no different.

58:43.645 --> 58:48.023
Live your ten years to the full.

59:04.666 --> 59:06.708
Jiro, we need to talk.

59:06.834 --> 59:08.877
- I've got a meeting.
- Cancel it.

59:25.520 --> 59:28.730
- This is a tall order.
- They're always tall.

59:28.856 --> 59:31.400
How long have you
been with us, Jiro?

59:32.527 --> 59:33.902
Jiro?

59:34.195 --> 59:36.405
- How long?
- Five years.

59:36.698 --> 59:40.242
You should be ready, then.
We want you to lead the project.

59:40.368 --> 59:43.912
It's the Navy's design competition
for 1932. A carrier-based fighter.

59:44.205 --> 59:45.414
A plum assignment.

59:48.543 --> 59:49.960
Well, Jiro?

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:02.764
What do you think?

01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:04.474
Leave it to me.

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:05.934
Good.

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.103
I'd like Honjo on the team.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:09.479
Bad idea.

01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:13.275
You'd end up competing.
Friendship's more important.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.777
Relax and finish your coffee.

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:18.280
Check, please.

01:00:18.906 --> 01:00:21.450
We've got other plans for Honjo.

01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:09.998
Damn these Japanese engines!

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:22.844
And damn this short flight deck.

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:29.184
Fresh uniforms!

01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:31.228
Oh, thanks.

01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:44.866
Thanks for your help.

01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:46.201
Those jerseys suit you.

01:02:13.187 --> 01:02:15.063
Close the flight deck!

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:09.284
Stop!

01:04:11.472 --> 01:04:12.847
We did it!

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.683
She's airborne!

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:21.916
Father!

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:11.341
Bravo! Nice catch.

01:06:15.429 --> 01:06:18.139
That was kind of you.
Are you all right?

01:06:18.265 --> 01:06:19.808
I'm fine. Here you are.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:22.977
Thank you.
It belongs to the hotel.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:24.479
Well, goodbye.

01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:40.995
Father, I'm afraid
I was rude to that man.

01:06:41.288 --> 01:06:43.331
Don't worry.
He's staying at our hotel.

01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:46.543
You'll have a chance
to say thank you.

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:32.834
What is it?

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:36.837
Nothing. Just that man
who caught the parasol.

01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:40.008
He seems to be here by himself.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.289
I'm sorry. I'd better go.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:59.087
No, please stay.
I was giving thanks to the spring.

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:03.424
I asked it
to bring you here, to me.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:11.474
You haven't changed at all.
You're just like you were then.

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:15.979
We were so grateful
for your help after the earthquake.

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:19.315
I wanted to see you
again and thank you.

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:21.484
Oh, now I remember.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.487
My name is Nahoko Satomi.

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.323
Jiro Horikoshi.

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:50.847
Are you all right?

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.348
I'm fine.

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:58.688
Kinu got married two days after
she dropped off your shirt.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.442
She cried for joy
when we found you.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:06.029
You were our knight
in shining armor.

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.196
Your knight?

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:10.700
You were like a knight on a
white horse that day.

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:13.536
This umbrella sure does leak.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.204
It's all right.

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:17.206
I've got to tell Kinu.

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:20.710
She just had her second child.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.837
It's such a cute baby.

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:28.551
Your painting is all wet.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:31.721
Yes. I'll keep it this way
in honor of today.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:34.057
Look, it's clearing up.

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:42.732
The rain stopped here.

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:46.569
Oh, look at that.

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.080
I'd almost forgotten
what rainbows look like.

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:59.582
Life is wonderful, isn't it?

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:04.253
We'd better go.
Father's probably worried sick.

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.093
There's my father.

01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:12.595
Father!

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:16.099
Come, I'll introduce you.

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.269
You're soaking wet.

01:13:20.395 --> 01:13:25.441
Don't worry, Father. I'm fine.
Mr. Horikoshi saved me again.

01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:26.943
Jiro Horikoshi.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:31.572
Satomi. I'm afraid my daughter has
caused you trouble again.

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:18.828
May I sit here?

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:21.831
Certainly.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.935
German tobacco. Last one. Too bad.

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:48.191
I know how you feel.
The same thing happened to me.

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:52.945
You visit Germany, yes? To Dessau.

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:56.449
You must be Sherlock Holmes.

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.868
You are an engineer.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:03.206
You read German magazines.
Magazines about airplanes.

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:07.210
All Japanese engineers visit Dessau.

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:11.214
You're exactly right.

01:15:12.507 --> 01:15:16.510
- Dr. Junkers is in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.225
He fights the government.
He will blow up.

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.727
Mr. Hitler's government?

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:28.231
The Nazis are a gang of hoodlums.

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:31.067
This is a good place.

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:35.738
No mosquitoes.
Not hot. Good watercress.

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:38.699
A good place to forget bad things.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:41.244
Cigarette? I'm afraid they're Japanese.

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.578
Thank you.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:52.255
It is a nice night.
Hier ist der Zauberberg.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:54.465
"The Magic Mountain"
by Thomas Mann?

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:57.260
A good place for forgetting.

01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:00.596
Make a war in China. Forget it.

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:03.849
Make a puppet state
in Manchuria. Forget it.

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:07.270
Quit the League of Nations. Forget it.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:10.106
Make the world your enemy. Forget it.

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:12.775
Japan will blow up.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.778
Germany will blow up too.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:20.449
- Will Germany go to war again?
- Yes. They must be stopped.

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:24.662
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting so long.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.290
Nahoko has a fever.

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:30.459
I'm afraid we'll have to
cancel our dinner plans.

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:34.463
I'm sorry. Please tell her
I hope she feels better.

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.800
I must go.
The doctor will be here soon.

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:36.419
"Who has seen the wind?"

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.588
"Neither I nor you."

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:44.760
"But when the leaves hang trembling,
the wind is passing through."

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:52.601
Let the wind carry...

01:18:53.728 --> 01:18:55.813
these wings to you.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.350
Jiro?

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:34.810
Nahoko!

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:56.665
Be careful!

01:21:56.453 --> 01:21:57.703
Nice catch.

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:14.530
Bravo!

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:17.366
Is the young lady feeling better?

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:19.868
Yes, she's much better.

01:23:19.994 --> 01:23:21.370
Congratulations.

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:25.207
This is the magic mountain.
It cures everyone.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.376
I think you're right.

01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:32.214
At first, this young man
was very gloomy.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:34.383
Now he is very happy.

01:23:35.009 --> 01:23:36.593
He has fallen in love.

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:38.554
That's true.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.558
Summer love is soon forgotten.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:46.395
You will go down the mountain.
You will forget what happened here.

01:23:47.021 --> 01:23:48.564
Not me.

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:53.402
This person you're talking about
wouldn't be my daughter, would it?

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:55.738
Yes, it's Nahoko.

01:23:57.532 --> 01:24:00.117
Please give us your permission.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:02.745
But...

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.079
Father!

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.167
I would like to accept.

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:10.419
What a beauty.

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:16.759
But first, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:17.885
Yes?

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:22.097
Two years ago,
my mother died of tuberculosis.

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:25.100
I contracted it too.

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:29.855
I've loved you since
that day you rescued my hat.

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:34.276
I've loved you since the wind
brought you to me.

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:36.779
Please marry me.

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:37.905
I will.

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:42.117
But I want to get well first.
Can you wait for me?

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:45.120
Even if it takes
a hundred years.

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.289
Congratulations.

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:52.044
He is a nice young man.
Your daughter is wonderful.

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:56.006
This is a good summer.

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:21.323
- Jiro, over here!
- Honjo!

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:23.659
- When did you get back?
- Two days ago.

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.327
Hot, isn't it?

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:29.998
Come take a look.

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:36.171
She's beautiful.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.340
Good clean lines.

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:45.848
It's a radical design.
They gave me free rein.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:49.184
But we won't know
until she flies.

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:53.188
She'll fly.
I feel the wind rising.

01:26:14.168 --> 01:26:18.213
You're the Japanese Achilles.
You've closed the gap.

01:26:19.173 --> 01:26:21.049
My plane was just a tin duckling.

01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:22.885
I have an idea for you.

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.554
I haven't tried it yet.

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:30.893
Use flathead screws
on the access hatches.

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.728
They'll reduce drag.

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:37.399
Maintenance will be easy
with a hinge on one side.

01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:45.407
A spring about this stiff
should be fine.

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:49.328
That's a great idea,
like Columbus and his egg.

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:50.579
You should use it.

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.248
Thanks, but not this time.

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:56.710
I'll keep the plans.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:27:00.088
After you use it,
I'll use it too.

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:02.257
Okay.

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:04.885
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:07.763
Jiro! Are you here?

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:10.766
Jiro, it's Mr. Kurokawa.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:12.100
It's an emergency.

01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:13.435
See you.

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.437
Visit the house next time.

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.272
Jiro, you pedal.

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:24.947
The Special Police
are looking for you.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:28.283
The thought crime boys.

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:30.118
Why me?

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:32.454
I told them you were
away on business.

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:46.635
Pretending to leave?
We won't fall for that.

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:49.471
You'd better work here.
We'll bring your things.

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:52.474
What's going on?
Why are they after me?

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:57.980
They arrested some of my friends.
None of them understood why.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.482
Come in.

01:28:00.608 --> 01:28:01.984
Here's your stuff.

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.821
Sorry for the bother.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:07.489
Need anything else?

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:10.492
- Just leave it and go.
- Jiro, it's here!

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:12.494
The prototype flange.

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:24.339
It looks great.

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:26.341
Wish we'd had it last year.

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:28.135
Jiro, what do you think?

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:32.514
Our next plane will be
a full-grown duck, not a duckling.

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:35.851
A full metal duck.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.602
How about it, Mr. Kurokawa?

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:42.190
Extruded aluminum alloy.
Very light. What a luxury.

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:43.942
All right, back to work.

01:28:55.872 --> 01:28:58.540
- The coast looks clear.
- Okay, Jiro.

01:29:00.376 --> 01:29:03.045
Better lie low for a few days.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.213
We'll smooth things over.

01:29:05.381 --> 01:29:07.049
I'll put you up.

01:29:07.216 --> 01:29:10.177
Let me stop by my apartment.
I'm expecting a letter.

01:29:11.054 --> 01:29:12.554
Is it something sensitive?

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.222
Yes, very sensitive.

01:29:14.557 --> 01:29:16.558
The police will be opening your mail.

01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:18.143
It's from my fiancée.

01:29:18.394 --> 01:29:21.897
Such things shouldn't happen
in a modern country.

01:29:23.733 --> 01:29:25.400
You're engaged?

01:29:26.235 --> 01:29:28.403
- Jiro's human after all.
- Splendid.

01:29:28.571 --> 01:29:30.739
You think Japan's a modern country?

01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:32.282
It's not funny.

01:29:32.575 --> 01:29:35.911
Of course it's not funny.
The police are waiting for you.

01:29:36.079 --> 01:29:38.288
Let them read your love letters.

01:29:38.748 --> 01:29:41.917
The Navy's next design
competition is in your hands.

01:29:42.251 --> 01:29:46.922
The company will protect you.
That is, as long as you're useful.

01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:49.424
Just keep your mind on work.

01:29:50.593 --> 01:29:54.096
I miss you terribly.
And "Mr. Castorp" left so suddenly.

01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:57.599
Why are they looking for him?

01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:15.033
I pray that he managed to
leave Japan safely.

01:30:32.468 --> 01:30:34.136
Jiro, telephone for you.

01:30:34.804 --> 01:30:35.804
Coming.

01:30:36.639 --> 01:30:38.640
- The telephone is there.
- Thank you.

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:44.479
- Hello?
- Jiro? You have a telegram.

01:30:44.647 --> 01:30:45.605
What?

01:30:45.731 --> 01:30:50.152
Your landlord brought it.
It came two days ago.

01:30:50.653 --> 01:30:51.820
Please read it.

01:30:52.155 --> 01:30:53.155
Are you sure?

01:30:55.324 --> 01:30:59.911
"Nahoko... has had
a lung... hemorrhage."

01:31:00.037 --> 01:31:02.497
"Please come at once.
Satomi"

01:31:09.672 --> 01:31:11.339
Hello? Are you there?

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:14.176
I understand. Thank you.

01:31:14.343 --> 01:31:15.844
Wait, hold on!

01:31:18.681 --> 01:31:19.681
What is it?

01:31:21.184 --> 01:31:23.935
What's the fastest way
to get to Tokyo?

01:31:24.187 --> 01:31:25.520
To Tokyo?

01:31:25.688 --> 01:31:28.190
I have to be there
as soon as possible.

01:31:28.357 --> 01:31:30.025
Let me see.

01:31:30.359 --> 01:31:34.362
If you take the noon bus,
you can catch the express.

01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:37.532
I'll send someone
to hold the bus for you.

01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:39.201
Jiya!

01:33:26.809 --> 01:33:27.809
Darling!

01:33:37.987 --> 01:33:39.988
I wish I could've
come sooner.

01:33:45.661 --> 01:33:47.162
You'll catch it.

01:33:47.496 --> 01:33:48.830
You're beautiful.

01:33:49.665 --> 01:33:50.999
I love you.

01:33:53.336 --> 01:33:55.170
Jiro? Through the garden?

01:34:04.847 --> 01:34:06.181
Come in.

01:34:08.017 --> 01:34:10.852
Father, Jiro came to see me.

01:34:11.187 --> 01:34:13.521
But he has to leave right away.

01:34:14.023 --> 01:34:18.193
- Next time I'll use the front door.
- Use the garden, it's more fun.

01:34:18.694 --> 01:34:20.195
All right, I will.

01:34:20.529 --> 01:34:22.530
Take care, darling.

01:34:23.032 --> 01:34:24.199
You too.

01:34:25.701 --> 01:34:27.202
Goodbye.

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:28.536
I'll see you out.

01:34:33.876 --> 01:34:36.878
The last train?
You'd better hurry.

01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:42.550
Is it that serious?
I wish I could look after her.

01:34:42.885 --> 01:34:46.054
The way to do that is
to focus on your work.

01:34:46.389 --> 01:34:47.889
Now you'd better go.

01:34:55.398 --> 01:34:56.898
He's gone.

01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.901
Are you crying, dear?

01:35:02.405 --> 01:35:07.242
I'm going to the sanatorium
the doctor recommended.

01:35:07.576 --> 01:35:10.912
But it's so lonely.
You'll be all by yourself.

01:35:11.747 --> 01:35:13.415
I want to get better.

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:15.750
I want a life with Jiro.

01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:24.426
You're just in time.
The board is waiting.

01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:33.184
So, are you ready?

01:35:34.103 --> 01:35:35.687
I'll do my best.

01:35:35.938 --> 01:35:38.606
Now the Navy.
They're the client.

01:35:49.618 --> 01:35:51.202
I'll do my best.

01:35:51.328 --> 01:35:53.955
- You weren't even listening.
- Right.

01:35:56.459 --> 01:35:58.626
So I gave up on that idea.

01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:04.799
- Everyone's here rather late.
- Jiro's holding a design seminar.

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:10.305
The next design uses
all the latest technology.

01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:13.475
- Take a look.
- Retractable undercarriage!

01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:16.144
We'll need it for 270 knots.

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:19.606
270 knots?
That's 500 kilometers an hour!

01:36:19.982 --> 01:36:22.358
I thought the Navy
requested 220 knots.

01:36:22.985 --> 01:36:25.320
We're designing for the future.

01:36:25.988 --> 01:36:28.490
Wing loading is 120 kilos
per square meter.

01:36:28.991 --> 01:36:33.161
We'll minimize drag
and push the limits of technology.

01:36:33.829 --> 01:36:36.664
She'll have split flaps
and leading edge slats.

01:36:53.349 --> 01:36:55.016
We can do it!

01:36:55.434 --> 01:36:57.393
When do we start?

01:36:58.187 --> 01:37:00.396
But then weight becomes a problem.

01:37:03.526 --> 01:37:06.528
If we leave out the guns,
we should be okay.

01:37:12.868 --> 01:37:16.037
I decided to set
this idea aside for now.

01:37:17.206 --> 01:37:19.207
This is delightful.
Lucid and logical.

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:20.792
Almost had it.

01:37:21.377 --> 01:37:23.336
Our engines are underpowered.

01:37:23.462 --> 01:37:26.548
To compensate, we need
a light, strong structure.

01:37:26.715 --> 01:37:30.885
We'll cut excess weight
and minimize drag with a smooth skin.

01:37:31.053 --> 01:37:33.721
We're going to build
an all-metal fighter...

01:37:33.889 --> 01:37:36.057
like nothing the world's ever seen.

01:37:36.559 --> 01:37:38.226
I have a question!

01:37:38.561 --> 01:37:40.061
Mr. Hirayama, please.

01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:44.232
Mr. Hirayama is our production engineer.

01:37:44.733 --> 01:37:45.525
Thank you.

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:50.738
He's going to tell us
about the new rivets.

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:57.036
It's technically possible to build
strong structures with flush rivets.

01:37:57.246 --> 01:37:58.580
What's he talking about?

01:37:59.081 --> 01:38:00.540
A way to cut drag.

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:06.129
We're going to skin
the whole aircraft with flush rivets.

01:38:06.255 --> 01:38:08.590
- Question!
- I have a question!

01:38:11.093 --> 01:38:13.428
I must say, that was interesting.

01:38:13.596 --> 01:38:15.096
It was inspiring.

01:38:35.451 --> 01:38:37.452
Today's letter, Miss Satomi.

01:38:37.786 --> 01:38:39.454
Thank you.

01:39:59.034 --> 01:40:00.535
Phone call, Chief.

01:40:00.869 --> 01:40:03.830
- I'll call back.
- I think it's an emergency.

01:40:04.039 --> 01:40:07.208
Hello? Mr. Satomi?

01:40:07.876 --> 01:40:09.377
What?!

01:41:22.284 --> 01:41:24.285
Jiro! Jiro!

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:28.122
Thank goodness.
I worried I wouldn't find you.

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:32.627
I'm here now. Can you walk?

01:41:33.796 --> 01:41:34.962
Let's go.

01:41:42.179 --> 01:41:45.306
I just had to see you.
I should go right back.

01:41:45.474 --> 01:41:46.307
Don't go.

01:41:50.145 --> 01:41:51.813
We should be together.

01:42:04.493 --> 01:42:07.161
- What a charming companion.
- My name is Nahoko.

01:42:07.329 --> 01:42:09.997
- So you're Nahoko.
- Jiro, is that you?

01:42:10.165 --> 01:42:12.333
We've come to you
with a request.

01:42:13.335 --> 01:42:15.336
Why not, dear? It'll be fine.

01:42:15.504 --> 01:42:17.171
We've got plenty of room...

01:42:17.339 --> 01:42:22.510
but I can hardly approve of
an unmarried couple living together.

01:42:23.178 --> 01:42:24.679
We'll get married right away.

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:27.765
Mr. Kurokawa, Mrs. Kurokawa,
please be our witnesses.

01:42:28.016 --> 01:42:29.350
Here? Tonight?

01:42:29.518 --> 01:42:31.519
It sounds lovely, dear.

01:42:31.687 --> 01:42:35.022
Nahoko was very brave
to leave the sanatorium.

01:42:35.524 --> 01:42:39.527
My father's given his permission.
I've already told the doctor.

01:42:39.862 --> 01:42:41.028
Please help us.

01:42:43.824 --> 01:42:46.701
The bride and I have
preparations to make.

01:42:47.202 --> 01:42:48.703
Come with me, Nahoko.

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:57.378
Don't worry, he's always like that.

01:43:01.383 --> 01:43:06.220
If you care about her,
you'll send her back immediately.

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:11.559
I can't do that.
I'd have to give up my work.

01:43:11.894 --> 01:43:15.062
Is that your heart
or your ego talking?

01:43:16.064 --> 01:43:19.317
We don't have much time.
We've made our decision.

01:43:20.569 --> 01:43:21.736
I see.

01:43:22.571 --> 01:43:25.072
All right.
We'll have a real ceremony!

01:43:49.848 --> 01:43:51.098
Here they come.

01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:53.601
She's coming!

01:44:12.955 --> 01:44:18.125
Hear me! This lovely maiden
has traveled far to join her beloved.

01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:23.798
She's given up everything
in the world for him. What say you?

01:44:24.299 --> 01:44:27.301
Hear me! This man is
an insensitive simpleton...

01:44:27.469 --> 01:44:29.637
without a home
of his own.

01:44:29.805 --> 01:44:33.140
If that's... uh, okay with you,
please come in.

01:44:33.308 --> 01:44:36.811
Then they shall exchange
the marriage vows.

01:44:59.501 --> 01:45:00.835
You look beautiful.

01:45:37.539 --> 01:45:39.540
Mr. and Mrs. Kurokawa.

01:45:40.042 --> 01:45:44.879
No words can express
our gratitude for your kindness.

01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:47.548
We will never forget our debt to you.

01:45:50.385 --> 01:45:55.389
Come now, we're delighted that
Jiro's found such a wonderful partner.

01:45:55.724 --> 01:45:56.557
Aren't we, dear?

01:45:56.725 --> 01:46:00.895
Of course. This is wonderful.
You're both very courageous.

01:46:16.912 --> 01:46:18.079
You must be tired.

01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:22.583
I feel like I'm dreaming.
The room is spinning.

01:46:22.918 --> 01:46:25.044
Better get some rest.

01:46:26.254 --> 01:46:27.171
Come here.

01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:28.923
But your condition...

01:46:31.093 --> 01:46:32.259
Come.

01:47:14.052 --> 01:47:16.637
Do you always
get home this late?

01:47:16.763 --> 01:47:18.347
Kayo, I completely forgot.

01:47:18.723 --> 01:47:20.599
You're so insensitive.

01:47:22.394 --> 01:47:24.937
Congratulations on becoming a doctor.

01:47:25.063 --> 01:47:27.940
Congratulations on your marriage.

01:47:28.233 --> 01:47:31.777
I came on behalf of the family
to thank the Kurokawas.

01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:33.279
Are they still up?

01:47:33.488 --> 01:47:34.947
They've gone to bed.

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:37.283
- Did you meet Nahoko?
- Yes.

01:47:41.246 --> 01:47:46.125
What are you going to do?
She's alone in that room all day.

01:47:46.585 --> 01:47:50.087
Her condition is
much worse than you think.

01:47:50.255 --> 01:47:53.132
I'm an intern.
I know something about this.

01:47:53.758 --> 01:47:58.971
Did you notice she uses rouge
every morning so you won't worry?

01:48:00.432 --> 01:48:03.976
I really like Nahoko.
She's such a good person.

01:48:04.102 --> 01:48:06.270
How can you do this to her?

01:48:10.817 --> 01:48:13.152
Does she really have to stay here?

01:48:13.278 --> 01:48:14.320
Yes.

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:19.658
Each day is very precious to us now.

01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:25.164
Get some rest.
I'm glad you came to visit.

01:48:40.472 --> 01:48:41.680
I'm home.

01:48:41.806 --> 01:48:44.016
- I was waiting.
- You should sleep.

01:48:50.315 --> 01:48:53.525
- Should you be up?
- Kayo came today.

01:48:54.319 --> 01:48:56.528
We're already best friends.

01:48:57.656 --> 01:49:01.533
She's like the sun,
with such a bright future.

01:49:01.993 --> 01:49:06.038
She said next time,
she'll come as my doctor.

01:49:07.499 --> 01:49:12.211
And your mother made me
a chemise and a nightgown.

01:49:12.671 --> 01:49:14.588
Look, they're so warm.

01:49:15.674 --> 01:49:16.799
Too bright?

01:49:17.676 --> 01:49:18.801
It's all right.

01:49:21.012 --> 01:49:23.389
I have to finish
the design by tomorrow.

01:49:23.682 --> 01:49:24.890
For your mackerel bones?

01:49:25.517 --> 01:49:26.725
You remembered.

01:49:27.644 --> 01:49:30.396
I think it could
be a little lighter.

01:49:32.691 --> 01:49:34.441
Come a little closer.

01:49:43.868 --> 01:49:45.411
Give me your hand.

01:49:48.707 --> 01:49:52.918
I like to look at you
while you work.

01:49:53.545 --> 01:49:58.257
In a one-handed slide rule contest,
I'd win first prize for sure.

01:49:59.384 --> 01:50:02.428
I think I can make each rib
half an ounce lighter.

01:50:02.721 --> 01:50:04.430
Really? That's good.

01:50:04.723 --> 01:50:06.765
Thirty ribs makes about a pound.

01:50:07.058 --> 01:50:08.392
That's too much.

01:50:08.893 --> 01:50:11.395
Half a pound is enough for two.

01:50:11.896 --> 01:50:16.108
I could eat a pound
of mackerel by myself.

01:50:21.906 --> 01:50:24.283
I'll keep holding your hand.
You should sleep.

01:50:24.409 --> 01:50:27.619
- You won't let go?
- No, I won't.

01:50:30.081 --> 01:50:33.459
I need a cigarette.
Can I let go for a minute?

01:50:33.752 --> 01:50:36.128
No. Smoke it here.

01:50:36.421 --> 01:50:38.630
- It's not good for you.
- I don't care.

01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:59.651
Hey, Honjo.

01:50:59.944 --> 01:51:01.320
Can I take a look?

01:51:01.613 --> 01:51:04.531
- Sure. How's your bomber?
- Coming along fine.

01:51:04.783 --> 01:51:08.827
This is avant garde.
You went all the way.

01:51:12.123 --> 01:51:14.333
So this is flush riveting.

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.169
Feels pretty rough.

01:51:18.296 --> 01:51:20.005
We're still learning the technique.

01:51:20.298 --> 01:51:25.177
You've left the Germans behind.
I'm still stuck with them.

01:51:27.722 --> 01:51:31.975
This design is you,
right down to the mackerel bones.

01:51:34.312 --> 01:51:39.525
Jiro, let me use flush rivets too.
And your spring-loaded hatches.

01:51:39.651 --> 01:51:41.360
Sure. Why not?

01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:42.694
A redesign?

01:51:42.821 --> 01:51:47.032
Yeah, but they're only letting me
modify the fuselage.

01:51:47.492 --> 01:51:48.867
And leave the wings alone?

01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:52.246
That's where the fuel tanks are.
One hit, and boom.

01:51:52.831 --> 01:51:56.542
To save weight, we're not even
shielding the fuel tanks.

01:51:56.668 --> 01:52:00.671
It's Japan's first advanced bomber.
The Navy's over the moon.

01:52:02.674 --> 01:52:06.552
She's got to fly 3,000 kilometers
with a big payload.

01:52:07.011 --> 01:52:09.555
More horsepower alone won't be enough.

01:52:22.777 --> 01:52:24.570
Who are they going to fight?

01:52:24.696 --> 01:52:28.740
China. Russia. Britain.
The Netherlands. America.

01:52:28.867 --> 01:52:30.242
Japan will blow up.

01:52:31.202 --> 01:52:35.080
We're not arms merchants.
We just want to build good aircraft.

01:52:35.206 --> 01:52:36.081
You're right.

01:52:36.207 --> 01:52:38.083
See you. Get some sleep.

01:52:38.209 --> 01:52:40.127
Sure. You too.

01:52:41.379 --> 01:52:42.754
I'm leaving now.

01:52:43.047 --> 01:52:44.256
Good night.

01:52:44.883 --> 01:52:45.799
Night.

01:53:11.075 --> 01:53:12.618
Welcome home.

01:53:13.077 --> 01:53:16.121
It's finished.
Now we'll see how she flies.

01:53:16.414 --> 01:53:19.458
Congratulations.
You worked so hard.

01:53:20.335 --> 01:53:23.003
She's on her way to the field.

01:53:23.254 --> 01:53:25.797
I'll probably spend
a few nights there.

01:53:26.758 --> 01:53:28.467
You must be tired.

01:53:30.762 --> 01:53:32.262
A little.

01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:34.473
I'm sure it will fly beautifully.

01:53:34.933 --> 01:53:37.267
Yes, she'll fly.

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:40.854
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:53:41.272 --> 01:53:43.315
I love you, Jiro.

01:53:44.108 --> 01:53:45.484
Nahoko...

01:54:38.663 --> 01:54:39.871
I'm off.

01:54:39.998 --> 01:54:41.373
Good luck.

01:55:07.859 --> 01:55:09.610
Why, Nahoko. You're up.

01:55:10.153 --> 01:55:14.906
I'm feeling much better today.
I'm going for a walk.

01:55:15.033 --> 01:55:17.909
Just be careful
not to tire yourself.

01:55:19.037 --> 01:55:23.248
The room's still a mess.
I'll straighten up when I get back.

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:25.917
All right. Enjoy yourself.

01:55:26.044 --> 01:55:28.754
Kayo's coming today.
That will be nice.

01:55:29.047 --> 01:55:30.922
Yes. I'll be back soon.

01:56:12.423 --> 01:56:14.466
Please come in.

01:56:20.598 --> 01:56:22.474
Oh, no.

01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:34.403
Look, she left letters!
One of them's for me.

01:56:40.284 --> 01:56:44.496
She's going to the sanatorium!
I'll bring her back.

01:56:44.789 --> 01:56:46.164
No! Let her go.

01:56:49.127 --> 01:56:52.671
We shouldn't do anything
until her train leaves.

01:56:54.298 --> 01:56:58.009
She wants him
to remember her as she was.

01:57:44.932 --> 01:57:48.685
This is wonderful.
Just think, that's one of ours.

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:50.896
How's her speed?

01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:54.483
Sorry, the numbers are too high.
We're checking them again.

01:57:54.692 --> 01:57:55.901
How fast?

01:57:56.027 --> 01:57:59.237
- 240 knots.
- Two forty!

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:37.442
- Fantastic!
- What a fighter.

01:58:38.736 --> 01:58:40.111
Hey, Jiro.

01:58:40.571 --> 01:58:41.780
Jiro!

01:58:49.747 --> 01:58:52.624
She flies like a dream.
Thank you.

02:00:05.364 --> 02:00:08.742
We meet again, Japanese boy.

02:00:09.994 --> 02:00:11.202
Mr. Caproni...

02:00:14.916 --> 02:00:18.043
This is where we first met.

02:00:18.169 --> 02:00:20.545
Our kingdom of dreams.

02:00:21.088 --> 02:00:22.714
Or the land of the dead.

02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:25.717
Not quite. In some ways, yes.

02:00:26.177 --> 02:00:30.138
Those ten years in the sun,
did you live them to the full?

02:00:30.264 --> 02:00:33.058
Yes. Things fell apart
toward the end, though.

02:00:33.351 --> 02:00:35.852
That's what it means to lose a war.

02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:38.563
There's your Zero fighter.

02:01:16.018 --> 02:01:18.770
Beautiful. A masterful design.

02:01:19.230 --> 02:01:21.439
Not a single plane returned.

02:01:21.691 --> 02:01:24.109
There was nothing
to come back to.

02:01:24.402 --> 02:01:27.404
Airplanes are beautiful dreams.
Cursed dreams...

02:01:27.655 --> 02:01:29.990
waiting for the sky
to swallow them up.

02:01:31.659 --> 02:01:33.451
Someone is waiting for you.

02:01:48.634 --> 02:01:49.634
Nahoko...

02:01:49.927 --> 02:01:53.096
She's been waiting here
for a long time.

02:01:53.597 --> 02:01:55.974
Darling, you must live.

02:02:00.312 --> 02:02:01.479
You must live...

02:02:23.794 --> 02:02:25.670
She is gone.

02:02:27.131 --> 02:02:29.507
She was beautiful, like the wind.

02:02:30.968 --> 02:02:34.679
Thank you.

02:02:36.223 --> 02:02:38.349
You must live.

02:02:38.642 --> 02:02:43.229
First, shall we drop by my house?
I have some excellent wine.

02:02:57.078 --> 02:03:01.289
A Tribute to Jiro Horikoshi
and Tatsuo Hori

Voices
Hideaki Anno Miori Takimoto

02:03:14.011 --> 02:03:18.890
A white sloping path

02:03:20.017 --> 02:03:25.396
Runs up into the sky

02:03:25.689 --> 02:03:30.068
A gently swaying, misy haze

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:35.406
Surrounding and holding

02:03:35.699 --> 02:03:41.412
Unnoticed by anyone, all alone

02:03:42.206 --> 02:03:47.418
Soaring upwards

02:03:47.878 --> 02:03:52.590
Not afraid of anything

02:03:52.883 --> 02:03:58.221
Dancing up

02:03:58.556 --> 02:04:03.768
Longing to be in the sky

02:04:04.061 --> 02:04:09.607
Speeding through the sky

02:04:10.067 --> 02:04:20.118
A whole life, a vapor trail

02:04:21.078 --> 02:04:25.790
Even before dying

02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:32.297
From that window, up high

02:04:32.590 --> 02:04:37.135
Watching the sky

02:04:37.928 --> 02:04:42.307
Now no one understands

02:04:42.933 --> 02:04:48.313
No one would understand

02:04:49.607 --> 02:04:59.824
All they could think was...
"Too young"

02:05:00.451 --> 02:05:05.371
Yet... happy

02:05:05.789 --> 02:05:11.169
Longing to be in the sky

02:05:11.295 --> 02:05:17.175
Speeding through the sky

02:05:17.468 --> 02:05:27.352
A whole life, a vapor trail

02:05:28.145 --> 02:05:33.358
Longing to be in the sky

02:05:33.651 --> 02:05:39.030
Speeding through the sky

02:05:39.657 --> 02:05:51.376
A whole life, a vapor trail

02:05:53.170 --> 02:05:55.880
