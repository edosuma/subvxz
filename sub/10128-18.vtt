CORY, ARE WE GOING
TO DO THIS?

00:29.133 --> 00:30.500
WE'RE GOING TO
DO THIS.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.834
IF WE'RE GOING TO DO
THIS WE HAVE TO DO IT.

00:31.834 --> 00:32.934
IT DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN.

00:32.934 --> 00:34.300
LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.467
WE HAVE TO PICK OUT
INVITATIONS.

00:35.467 --> 00:36.967
I HAVE TO START
LOOKING FOR DRESSES.

00:36.967 --> 00:38.133
WE NEED TO PICK OUT RINGS,
A CATERER, A FLORIST,

00:38.133 --> 00:39.200
A BAND, A PHOTOGRAPHER,
A CAKE.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.834
BUT.
BUT-BUT-BUT WHAT?

00:40.834 --> 00:43.000
BUT WE HAVEN'T EVEN
SET A DATE YET.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.033
WE DON'T SET THE DATE.

00:44.033 --> 00:45.667
ANY BANQUET HALL WORTH
HAVING YOUR WEDDING IN

00:45.667 --> 00:47.000
BOOKS UP 2 YEARS IN ADVANCE.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.400
WE PICK THE HALL,
THE HALL PICKS THE DATE.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.567
I'M SO TIRED.

00:50.567 --> 00:52.500
HALL. WE HAVE TO
PICK OUT A HALL.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.600
ARE YOU HELPING OR NOT?

00:53.600 --> 00:55.600
JUST LET ME SLEEP
FOR HALF AN HOUR.

00:55.600 --> 00:56.600
I-I PROMISE.

00:58.967 --> 01:02.000
WE'VE BEEN HANGING OUT
WITH EACH OTHER FOR
A LONG TIME NOW.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.500
YEAH. SO,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

01:03.500 --> 01:06.834
THE PROBLEM IS, I'M NOT
GETTING ANY YOUNGER, OK?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.467
WHAT?

01:08.467 --> 01:10.467
I'M THE OLDEST KID
AT ST. MARY'S.

01:10.467 --> 01:12.934
I DON'T EVEN FIT
IN MY BED ANYMORE.

01:12.934 --> 01:15.100
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO, TOMMY?

01:15.100 --> 01:18.000
ARE YOU GOING TO
ADOPT ME OR NOT?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.400
WHAT?

01:20.400 --> 01:24.233
YOU SAID WE WERE
THE BEST TEAM SINCE
SCOOBY-DOO AND SHAGGY.

01:24.233 --> 01:28.400
OH, WELL, WE ARE, BUDDY.
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO LET ME ADOPT YOU.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.100
I MEAN, THEY'RE JUST
NOT. THEY'RE GOING TO
TELL ME IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

01:32.100 --> 01:36.600
SCOOBY DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE WHEN
SHAGGY FELL INTO THE WELL.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.867
YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID?

01:37.867 --> 01:39.967
TOMMY, THIS ISN'T
A CARTOON.

01:39.967 --> 01:43.867
HE SAVED HIM. HE SAVED HIM
BECAUSE HE LOVED HIM.

01:43.867 --> 01:46.200
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU,
TOMMY.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.300
THEN WHY WON'T YOU SAVE ME?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.900
TOPANGA, LISTEN.
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

02:04.900 --> 02:08.000
I FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
BEING AT A WEDDING THAT
WE WEREN'T INVITED TO.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.300
CORY, IT GOES ON
ALL THE TIME.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.800
MR. BECKMAN,
THE WEDDING PLANNER,

02:10.800 --> 02:13.233
SAID THAT AS LONG AS
WE KEEP A LOW PROFILE,
EVERYTHING WILL BE OK.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.967
THESE THINGS
ARE DELICIOUS.

02:15.967 --> 02:19.667
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
SHOULD GET MARRIED HERE.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.100
OUR WEDDING WILL
NEVER BE THIS BEAUTIFUL.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.500
AND WHY NOT?

02:22.500 --> 02:25.000
BECAUSE WE'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO AFFORD
A WEDDING LIKE THIS.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.467
HA HA HA. WAIT A MINUTE,
YOUR DAD'S NOT RICH?

02:28.467 --> 02:30.100
NO.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.133
UH, BYE.

02:32.967 --> 02:35.500
LET ME MAKE YOU
UNDERSTAND THIS FROM
A PERSONAL STANDPOINT.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.900
MY DAUGHTER LIKES
NICE THINGS.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.133
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO GIVE HER NICE THINGS

02:38.133 --> 02:39.567
WITH THAT THING
YOU CALL A SALARY?

02:39.567 --> 02:42.200
WELL, THAT DEPENDS
ON HOW YOU DEFINE
"NICE THINGS," STAN.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.500
I LOVE JESSIE,
THAT'S A NICE THING.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.100
WE'RE GOING TO BE TOGETHER
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.400
THAT'S A NICE THING, TOO.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.867
YOU'RE UPSETTING ME.

02:49.867 --> 02:51.667
JESSIE DRIVES
A JAG CONVERTIBLE.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.934
HOW YOU PLAN
TO KEEP HER IN
A JAG CONVERTIBLE

02:53.934 --> 02:55.367
IF YOU DON'T COME
INTO MY COMPANY?

02:55.367 --> 02:57.700
I KEEP TELLING YOU, STAN,
I'M NOT COMING
INTO YOUR COMPANY.

02:57.700 --> 02:58.934
WHEN I TELL YOU
WHAT'S RIGHT
FOR YOUR LIFE,

02:58.934 --> 03:00.100
WHY DON'T YOU
LISTEN TO ME?

03:00.100 --> 03:01.233
I'M HAPPY WHERE I AM.

03:01.233 --> 03:02.767
TEACHING KINDYGARTEN?

03:02.767 --> 03:06.200
OOH, YOU KNOW, LISTEN,
I WOULD LIKE TO STAY
AND TALK TO YOU, STAN,

03:06.200 --> 03:08.000
BUT I'VE GOT TO GO MARRY
YOUR DAUGHTER NOW.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.867
DON'T YOU WALK
AWAY FROM ME.

03:09.867 --> 03:13.967
NO RESPECT. THIS GUY
WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

03:13.967 --> 03:17.400
HOW COULD MY DAUGHTER
FALL FOR SOMEBODY
WHO WON'T LISTEN TO ME?

03:28.300 --> 03:31.667
MR. BECKMAN SAID
I COULD STAND HERE.

03:31.667 --> 03:35.500
IN ONE HOUR, MY DAUGHTER'S
GONNA BE MARRIED TO
A TEACHER OF KINDYGARTEN.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.767
YOU KNOW, MY KINDERGARTEN
TEACHER WAS MR. FEENY.

03:38.767 --> 03:44.900
AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE HAS
BEEN MY TEACHER EVERY
YEAR OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

03:44.900 --> 03:47.400
ISN'T THAT CURIOUS?

03:47.400 --> 03:49.934
YOU A FRIEND OF MY
DAUGHTER OR THE LOSER?

03:49.934 --> 03:51.100
UH, NEITHER ONE, SIR.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.500
SIR, YOU CALLED ME SIR.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.033
THAT'S A TERM OF RESPECT.
I LIKE THAT.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.667
YOU KNOW WHAT
HE CALLS ME?

03:55.667 --> 03:58.000
STAN, LIKE IT SAYS
ON THE SIDE
OF MY TRUCKS.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.600
AH...YOU'RE STAN, STAN,
THE PLUMBER MAN?

04:03.600 --> 04:06.200
IF I CAN'T FLUSH IT--

04:06.200 --> 04:08.000
NO ONE CAN!

04:09.800 --> 04:11.300
I LIKE YOU, KID.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.133
I LIKE YOU, TOO,
STAN STAN.

04:13.133 --> 04:14.767
YOU WOULD LISTEN TO ME
WHEN I'D TALK TO YOU,
WOULDN'T YOU, KID?

04:14.767 --> 04:17.967
OH, YEAH. I BELIEVE
A LOT OF MY GENERATION
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF

04:17.967 --> 04:19.200
LISTENING TO THEIR ELDERS,

04:19.200 --> 04:22.400
INSTEAD OF WEARING THOSE
FANCY-SCHMANCY BACKWARD HATS

04:22.400 --> 04:25.200
AND HAVING THOSE BOLTS
THROUGH THEIR HEADS.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.033
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL
SENTIMENT, KID. LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.500
ANYTHING, SIR.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.834
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING AT MY WEDDING?

04:30.834 --> 04:32.100
MY NAME'S CORY MATTHEWS.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.033
I'M HERE WITH
MY LOVELY FIANCÉE TOPANGA.

04:34.033 --> 04:35.200
ISN'T SHE LOVELY?

04:35.200 --> 04:37.600
THEY'RE ALL LOVELY
WITH THE LIGHTS OFF.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.700
I WOULDN'T KNOW, SIR.

04:39.700 --> 04:40.867
YOU'RE A VIRGIN?

04:40.867 --> 04:41.867
I'M CURSED, SIR.

04:41.867 --> 04:43.600
YOU'RE IT, KID.
I'M IT FOR WHAT?

04:43.600 --> 04:45.133
I CHOOSE YOU.
CHOOSE ME FOR WHAT?

04:45.133 --> 04:47.200
YOU'RE THE TYPE
OF NICE KID I ALWAYS
SAW WITH MY JESSIE.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.200
BUT ISN'T SHE MARRYING
THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER?

04:49.200 --> 04:50.300
NO.
NO?

04:50.300 --> 04:51.300
BUT DOESN'T SHE LOVE HIM?

04:51.300 --> 04:53.300
I DON'T LOVE HIM.
I LOVE YOU.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.867
AND SO WILL SHE
IF I TELL HER TO.

04:54.867 --> 04:56.700
ME? BUT WHY ME?

04:56.700 --> 05:00.700
BECAUSE YOU'RE A NICE,
POLITE KID WHO LISTENS
TO ME AND RESPECTS ME

05:00.700 --> 05:02.233
LIKE THE SON I DESERVE.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.567
I'LL GIVE YOU
A MILLION DOLLARS
TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER.

05:04.567 --> 05:07.600
A MILLION?
THAT'S JUST CRAZY!

05:07.600 --> 05:13.233
NEGOTIATION?
WE'RE IN NEGOTIATION?!

05:13.233 --> 05:15.400
HA HA, WHAT A KID!

05:15.400 --> 05:19.800
YOU JUST KEEP GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.400
A MILLION 2.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.867
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU,
STAN,

05:22.867 --> 05:24.767
BUT I HAVE A GIRL
OVER THERE ON THE SIDE.

05:24.767 --> 05:27.200
HEY, WHO DOESN'T?
COME ON...

05:27.200 --> 05:29.000
YOU'VE GOT 20 MINUTES
TO BREAK THIS UP.

05:30.734 --> 05:31.734
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?

05:31.734 --> 05:32.734
HONEY.

05:32.734 --> 05:34.734
NO, EVEN FOR HIM
THIS IS NUTS.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.400
HE CAN'T EVEN TAKE
CARE OF HIMSELF.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.500
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
I RESENT THAT. I RESENT
THE HECK OUT OF THAT.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.000
I'M A GROWN MAN.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.467
I AM FULLY CAPABLE
OF TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ANOTHER HUMAN LIFE.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.367
YOUR FLY IS OPEN.

05:44.367 --> 05:45.600
I KNOW!

05:47.300 --> 05:49.834
NOW, LOOK,
I DEMAND YOU TAKE ME
SERIOUSLY, ALL RIGHT?

05:49.834 --> 05:52.400
I LOVE TOMMY
AND HE LOVES ME.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.600
NOW WHAT?!

05:53.600 --> 05:55.600
AH, J--

05:55.600 --> 05:56.600
PUTAI!

05:58.834 --> 06:00.767
LISTEN TO ME, OK?

06:00.767 --> 06:02.133
TOMMY WANTS ME TO ADOPT HIM.

06:02.133 --> 06:04.000
I DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR YOUR PERMISSION.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.800
I CAME HERE
FOR ENCOURAGEMENT.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.600
I GUESS I CAME TO
THE WRONG PLACE.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.734
ERIC, YOU WOULD MAKE
A GREAT PARENT
TO TOMMY SOMEDAY,

06:11.734 --> 06:12.767
BUT NOT NOW.

06:12.767 --> 06:14.200
WHY NOT NOW?!

06:14.200 --> 06:15.400
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE A JOB,

06:15.400 --> 06:16.900
BECAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE A HOME.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.500
YOU SLEEP ON OUR COUCH.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.500
YOU THINK I LIKE
SLEEPING ON YOUR COUCH?

06:20.500 --> 06:22.867
YOU KNOW WHY I SLEEP HERE?
IT'S 'CAUSE I'VE GOT
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

06:22.867 --> 06:25.100
I LOST MY BEST FRIEND
TO THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS,

06:25.100 --> 06:27.100
I LOST MY BROTHER TO
THE GIRL OF HIS DREAMS,

06:27.100 --> 06:29.300
I LOST FEENY TO THE DEAN,

06:29.300 --> 06:32.200
AND I LOST YOU GUYS
TO THE NEW BABY.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.900
OH, THAT IS JUST SO SILLY.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.667
LOOK AT THIS, IT'S TRUE.

06:37.667 --> 06:41.200
EVERYBODY I KNOW HAS
SOMEBODY THAT THEY WANT
TO DEDICATE THEIR LIFE TO.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.100
NOW THAT I FINALLY
HAVE THAT, YOU'RE
TRYING TO DISCOURAGE ME.

06:44.100 --> 06:47.767
ERIC, EVEN IF WE AGREED
TO THIS, THEY WON'T
LET YOU ADOPT HIM.

06:47.767 --> 06:49.467
YOU CAN'T SUPPORT HIM,
YOU CAN'T GIVE
HIM A HOME.

06:49.467 --> 06:51.734
YOU ARE A GREAT
BIG BROTHER. BE THAT.

06:51.734 --> 06:53.400
THAT'S WHAT HE
NEEDS FROM YOU.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.400
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT TOMMY
NEEDS? TOMMY NEEDS ME.
THAT'S WHAT HE NEEDS,

06:56.400 --> 06:59.100
AND I'M GOING TO DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO
MAKE SURE THAT HE'S GOT ME.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.300
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM,
THAT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.967
NOW I'M GOING TO
GO CALL ST. MARY'S

07:02.967 --> 07:05.600
AND HAVE THEM PUT TOMMY
ON HOLD OR, YOU KNOW,
LAYAWAY OR WHATEVER.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.100
WHY ARE OUR
CHILDREN SO CRAZY?

07:11.100 --> 07:14.600
PLEASE DON'T BE CRAZY,
PLEASE BE NORMAL.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.467
THEY MAY BE CRAZY,
BUT THEY HAVE
GOOD HEARTS.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.500
HAVE A GOOD HEART,
LIKE YOUR BROTHER.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.600
OH, ALAN, YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'RE GOING ALONG WITH THIS?

07:20.600 --> 07:23.600
THE KID JUST PULLED
HIS SHIRT OUT OF HIS FLY.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.934
NO ONE ELSE
COULD DO THAT.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.367
SOME OTHER PEOPLE
WANT TO ADOPT TOMMY.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.100
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

07:48.100 --> 07:49.500
'CAUSE I'M NOT
GOING WITH THEM.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.567
I DON'T THINK YOU
HAVE THAT CHOICE, TOM.
I, UM...

07:54.734 --> 07:55.500
DOES HE?

07:55.500 --> 07:58.100
ACTUALLY, HE DOES.
WE WOULD NEVER
PLACE A CHILD

07:58.100 --> 07:59.734
WITH A FAMILY
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE WITH,

07:59.734 --> 08:01.467
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S
AN EMOTIONAL CONFLICT.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.934
WHAT'S THE EMOTIONAL
CONFLICT?

08:02.934 --> 08:04.200
YOU ARE.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.867
OH, BOY.

08:07.867 --> 08:11.100
I TOLD THEM I WOULDN'T
GO WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

08:11.100 --> 08:16.867
OH. LOOK, TOM, IF
THESE PEOPLE ARE GOOD
ENOUGH TO ADOPT YOU,

08:16.867 --> 08:18.567
THEN I'M SURE THEY'RE
GOING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH

08:18.567 --> 08:20.133
TO LET ME KEEP BEING
YOUR BIG BROTHER.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.200
WE'LL JUST TELL THEM
THAT I COME ALONG
AS PART OF THE DEAL.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.000
THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.200
WHY? OH, I KNOW WHY.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.600
'CAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
AFTER THEY MEET ME,

08:26.600 --> 08:27.967
THEY'RE GOING TO LIKE
ME BETTER THAN YOU.

08:27.967 --> 08:29.233
THAT'S PRETTY
SELFISH, THOMAS.

08:29.233 --> 08:31.300
THEY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.400
THEY LIVE IN
CALIFORNIA?

08:36.400 --> 08:37.900
YEAH, THEY DO.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.200
I DON'T WANT THEM
TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.300
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.934
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING I CAN DO.

08:48.934 --> 08:51.300
I WOULD LIKE
TO ADOPT TOMMY, PLEASE.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.000
ERIC, MAYBE WE
SHOULD DISCUSS
THIS IN MY OFFICE.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I WANT ERIC! I PICK ERIC!

08:56.000 --> 08:58.800
HEY, KIDS,
I'M GETTING ADOPTED!

08:58.800 --> 09:00.967
I'M GETTING ADOPTED. YES!

09:02.500 --> 09:04.667
THIS IS, LIKE,
THE HAPPIEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.100
TAKE THE MONEY.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.500
BUT I LOVE TOPANGA.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.400
WE ALL DO.
TAKE THE MONEY.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.467
SHAWN, MONEY
CAN'T BUY ME--

09:13.467 --> 09:14.834
WELL, LET'S SEE
IF IT CAN.

09:14.834 --> 09:16.133
TAKE THE MONEY.

09:16.133 --> 09:17.867
NO, I'M NOT
TAKING THE MONEY, OK?

09:17.867 --> 09:19.867
I LOVE TOPANGA
MORE THAN THE MONEY.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.500
TOPANGA IS MY LIFE.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.767
CORY, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE JUST STANDING AROUND.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.233
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE DOING RESEARCH.

09:25.233 --> 09:26.600
I KNOW,
I WAS GONNA--

09:26.600 --> 09:28.367
"I WAS GONNA."
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, ANGELA?

09:28.367 --> 09:30.467
YEP. YOU'RE GOING
TO DO EVERYTHING
BY YOURSELF.

09:30.467 --> 09:33.200
AUUGH. CORY, I DON'T
ASK MUCH OF YOU.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.967
AND YOU. YOU'RE HIS BEST
FRIEND. YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO HELP HIM. HELP HIM.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.834
CORY, I CAN'T DO THIS
ALL BY MYSELF.

09:38.834 --> 09:41.200
NOW, I WANT YOU GUYS
TO BE TAKING NOTES
DURING THE WEDDING

09:41.200 --> 09:43.300
SO WE CAN DECIDE WHAT
WE WANT AND DO NOT WANT
FOR OUR OWN WEDDING.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.233
ARE YOU GUYS
LISTENING TO ME?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.233
AUUGH!

09:50.233 --> 09:53.767
WELL, FINE. IF YOU'RE NOT
TAKING THE MONEY, I AM.

09:53.767 --> 09:54.800
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

09:54.800 --> 09:57.133
MONEY. WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT MONEY.

09:57.133 --> 09:58.600
WE DON'T HAVE ANY.
I KNOW.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.800
CORY, I WISH OUR WEDDING
COULD BE THIS BEAUTIFUL.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.467
DON'T YOU EVER WONDER
WHAT IT'D BE LIKE

10:02.467 --> 10:04.834
TO HAVE ALL THE MONEY
IN THE WORLD AND YOU COULD
JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANTED?

10:04.834 --> 10:09.667
NO! NEVER.
WHERE DO YOU GET
THESE MESHUGA IDEAS?

10:10.967 --> 10:12.000
HOW YA DOING?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.133
DO I KNOW YOU?

10:13.133 --> 10:15.467
NO, BUT YOU WANT TO
KNOW ME. YOU KNOW WHY?

10:15.467 --> 10:18.300
'CAUSE RUMOR HAS IT
YOU'RE UNHAPPY WITH YOUR
DAUGHTER'S CHOICE OF LIFE MATE.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.667
CUT TO THE CHASE, SPANKY.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.600
FROM THE MOMENT
THAT I LAID MY EYES

10:21.600 --> 10:23.300
UPON YOUR BEAUTIFUL
DAUGHTER'S FACE,

10:23.300 --> 10:25.567
I KNEW THAT SHE
WAS MAKING THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE OF HER LIFE,

10:25.567 --> 10:27.500
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T
MARRYING ME.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.867
REALLY? YOU WANT
TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER?

10:28.867 --> 10:30.600
NO, NO.
NOT WANT TO, MUST.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.033
MUST MARRY HER,
MUST WORK FOR YOU.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.200
YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE
YOU'RE A WINNER,
AND I'M A WINNER.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.967
AND WE WINNERS NEED TO
STICK TOGETHER AND MARRY
EACH OTHER'S DAUGHTERS.

10:38.967 --> 10:40.600
I'LL GO FIRST.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.734
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.

10:41.734 --> 10:43.400
I WAS JUST TALKING
TO THAT CURLY-HEADED KID

10:43.400 --> 10:44.700
WHO'S HAPPY
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND--

10:44.700 --> 10:46.200
UGH, MUSTARD.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.367
STOP!

10:48.767 --> 10:51.400
AND I LOOKED AT THAT KID
AND I LISTENED TO THAT KID,

10:51.400 --> 10:53.900
AND I KNEW HE WAS WORTH
A MILLION DOLLARS.

10:53.900 --> 10:57.300
IRONY OF IRONIES,
YOU COME ALONG,

10:57.300 --> 11:00.500
AND I'M PREPARED TO MAKE
YOU THE FOLLOWING OFFER.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.600
WELL, I'LL BE
HONEST WITH YOU,

11:01.600 --> 11:03.000
'CAUSE I GOT
A NUMBER IN MY HEAD,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.233
AND I KNOW
WHAT I'M WORTH--

11:04.233 --> 11:06.967
I'LL GIVE YOU 20 BUCKS
TO GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.300
OK.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.500
BOY, YOU SURE LIKE
TO GET A LOT OF INFORMATION

11:14.500 --> 11:16.033
BEFORE YOU LET SOMEBODY
TAKE A KID, HUH?

11:16.033 --> 11:19.133
WELL, NORMALLY
WE JUST PULL NAMES
OUT OF A HAT,

11:19.133 --> 11:22.100
BUT WE REALLY
LIKE TOMMY.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.100
THIS IS THE BACKGROUND
ON THE OTHER COUPLE
INTERESTED IN HIM.

11:25.100 --> 11:27.500
YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO SHOW ME THAT?

11:27.500 --> 11:31.400
NO, I'M NOT.
BUT IN THIS CASE,

11:31.400 --> 11:34.800
YOU BEING THE BIG
BROTHER AND WANTING
WHAT'S BEST FOR TOMMY,

11:34.800 --> 11:36.800
I THINK IT'LL BE OK.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.900
TOMMY'S BEEN HERE
A LONG TIME, AND...

11:39.900 --> 11:41.900
WE REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.800
WE WOULDN'T PLACE HIM
WITH JUST ANYBODY.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.734
I KNOW, BUT, I MEAN,
COME ON, WHY DO THEY HAVE
TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA?

11:46.734 --> 11:48.567
THEY USED
TO LIVE HERE
IN PHILADELPHIA.

11:48.567 --> 11:50.300
THAT'S WHEN THEY
ADOPTED THEIR FIRST
CHILD FROM US.

11:50.300 --> 11:53.200
A LITTLE GIRL
3 YEARS AGO, SARA.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.734
WELL, I MEAN, THEY CAN
KEEP SARA. I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

11:56.734 --> 11:59.300
WE USED TO GET
LOTS OF LETTERS
FROM SARA,

11:59.300 --> 12:01.133
TELLING US HOW
HAPPY SHE WAS.

12:01.133 --> 12:06.100
THEN WE GOT FEWER
LETTERS, AND THEN
THEY STOPPED COMING.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.100
'CAUSE SHE WASN'T
HAPPY ANYMORE.

12:08.100 --> 12:10.400
'CAUSE WE WEREN'T
HER FAMILY ANYMORE.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.934
THEY ARE.

12:11.934 --> 12:16.200
AS MUCH AS IT HURTS,
WE LOVE IT WHEN
THE LETTERS STOP.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.900
HERE'S A NOTE
FROM HER MOTHER:

12:19.900 --> 12:22.900
"DEAR MRS. GALLAGHER,
HERE IS SARA'S
THIRD GRADE PICTURE.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.233
"AS YOU CAN SEE,
SHE'S GROWING INTO
A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY,

12:25.233 --> 12:27.900
"AND WE NEVER REALIZED
IT WAS POSSIBLE TO LOVE
SOMEONE SO MUCH.

12:27.900 --> 12:30.100
"THE ONE THING THAT
COULD MAKE OUR FAMILY
MORE COMPLETE

12:30.100 --> 12:33.233
"WOULD BE A BROTHER
FOR SARA AND A SON FOR US.

12:33.233 --> 12:37.000
"WE CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT TOMMY AND HOW HAPPY
WE WOULD ALL BE TOGETHER.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.834
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR CONSIDERING US."

12:41.567 --> 12:44.133
I LOVE TOMMY, TOO.

12:44.133 --> 12:48.900
I KNOW. NOW YOU JUST
HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH.

13:11.033 --> 13:13.600
LOOK, DAD,
I PACKED ALL MY STUFF.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.300
I'M ALL READY TO GO.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.200
ISN'T IT COOL THE WAY
I CALL YOU "DAD"?

13:18.200 --> 13:21.100
YEAH, TOMMY.
IT'S WAY COOL.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.100
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.100
LET'S GO.
COME ON.

13:33.133 --> 13:34.200
WHAT?

13:36.033 --> 13:38.300
I CAN'T BE YOUR DAD, TOMMY.

13:38.300 --> 13:39.233
WHY NOT?

13:39.233 --> 13:41.000
COME HERE.

13:50.100 --> 13:54.900
THESE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA,
THEY SOUND REALLY...NICE.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.767
BUT I WANT TO BE
HERE WITH YOU.

13:57.767 --> 14:01.500
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
A MOM AND A DAD

14:01.500 --> 14:04.900
AND...A HOUSE WITH
A BIG POOL AND A BIG SISTER

14:04.900 --> 14:08.600
AND...A DOG NAMED WALDO.

14:08.600 --> 14:11.567
I DON'T NEED A DOG.
I HAVE YOU.

14:11.567 --> 14:15.400
ERIC, I'M NEVER
GOING WITH ANYBODY
EXCEPT YOU.

14:21.033 --> 14:23.400
I'M NOT GOING
TO ADOPT YOU, TOMMY.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.667
WHY NOT?

14:24.667 --> 14:27.800
BECAUSE...I'M NOT.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.567
YES, YOU ARE.

14:34.500 --> 14:41.300
TOMMY...I'M NOT
GOING TO ADOPT YOU.

14:41.300 --> 14:44.967
I DON'T LIKE YOU ANYMORE.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.700
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, TOM.

14:47.700 --> 14:52.500
AND NOW I'M GOING
TO CALIFORNIA TO BE WITH
PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT ME.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.734
GOOD FOR YOU, TOMMY.

14:56.734 --> 14:58.600
GOOD FOR YOU, MAN.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.300
GOOD FOR YOU.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.300
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT
YOU COULD DO WITH
A MILLION DOLLARS?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.767
WHY DOES THAT MAN
KEEP TALKING TO CORY?

15:35.767 --> 15:38.133
IT MAKES YOU MAD,
DOESN'T IT?

15:38.133 --> 15:41.200
YOU SHOULD
BREAK UP WITH HIM.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.400
I THINK THE FIRST
THING I WOULD DO

15:43.400 --> 15:45.734
WOULD BE TO BUY A VOLVO.

15:45.734 --> 15:47.867
HE'S BUYING A VOLVO.

15:47.867 --> 15:50.100
HE'S KEEPING
MY LITTLE GIRL SAFE

15:50.100 --> 15:52.734
WITH THE STEEL CAGE
AND THE SIDE AIR BAGS.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.734
GIVE YOUR OLD MAN A HUG.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.100
OK, BUT I GOT
TO TELL YOU, STAN.

15:58.100 --> 16:01.300
I AM NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR MONEY
OR YOUR DAUGHTER.

16:03.300 --> 16:06.100
HOY!

16:06.100 --> 16:09.100
DADDY, AREN'T YOU GOING
TO WALK ME DOWN THE AISLE?

16:09.100 --> 16:12.233
I WAS JUST FINISHING UP
A BUSINESS DISCUSSION
WITH MY FRIEND CORY.

16:12.233 --> 16:14.600
HI, CORY. THANK YOU FOR
COMING TO MY WEDDING.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.500
<i>[WEDDING MARCH </i>PLAYS]

16:18.867 --> 16:22.200
COME ON, DAD.
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.300
THINK CAREFULLY, KID.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.467
YOU'LL NEVER GET
THIS KIND OF CHANCE
AS LONG AS YOU LIVE.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.500
DEARLY BELOVED,
WE ARE GATHERED HERE

16:46.500 --> 16:50.500
TO JOIN JESSICA AND EDWARD
IN HOLY MATRIMONY.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.967
THIS WHOLE THING IS
SO OUT OF OUR LEAGUE.

16:52.967 --> 16:56.500
THEY'LL PROBABLY GET
IN SOME PRIVATE JET
AND HONEYMOON IN TAHITI.

16:56.500 --> 17:01.200
IN SOME PRIVATE
ROMANTIC VILLA
ON SOME NUDE BEACH.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.400
HOY!

17:02.400 --> 17:04.200
YOU JUST SAW THE BRIDE?

17:04.200 --> 17:06.867
OOH, YEAH.

17:06.867 --> 17:09.567
CAN YOU IMAGINE
THE KIND OF HONEYMOON
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE?

17:09.567 --> 17:12.800
YEAH. COULD YOU
JUST IMAGINE?

17:12.800 --> 17:13.900
NO.

17:21.967 --> 17:23.967
Pastor: IF THERE IS
ANYONE HERE PRESENT

17:23.967 --> 17:26.100
WHO MIGHT GIVE JUST CAUSE
AS TO WHY THESE TWO

17:26.100 --> 17:28.300
SHOULD NOT BE JOINED
IN HOLY MATRIMONY,

17:28.300 --> 17:32.100
SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER
HOLD YOUR PEACE.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:33.367 --> 17:34.300
SPASM.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.967
YOUNG MAN, DO YOU
HAVE SOMETHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?

17:48.967 --> 17:50.300
YES, YES, YOU DO.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.600
SAY SOMETHING, KID.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:53.800 --> 17:56.500
DO YOU MIND? I'M TALKING
TO MY SON-IN-LAW.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.367
GO AHEAD.
OK, WE'RE GOING TO DO
THIS NOW, ALL RIGHT?

17:59.367 --> 18:00.500
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.
OK.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.000
WE'RE GOING TO GET UP.
WE'RE GETTING UP.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.500
ATTA BOY. GOOD BOY.
GOOD, YOU'RE UP. YOU'RE UP.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.500
GO TO IT.
ALL RIGHT.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.767
HI. I DON'T KNOW
ANY OF YOU,

18:10.767 --> 18:15.600
BUT, UM, I GUESS
I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT HERE.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.667
ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY
LISTEN TO THIS.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.967
LISTEN UP, HONEY.

18:20.967 --> 18:24.867
UM, THIS IS THE GREATEST
PLACE TO GET MARRIED
THAT I'VE EVER SEEN,

18:24.867 --> 18:29.233
AND I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
TO BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.767
BUT, I CAN'T, SO
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.467
CORY, WILL YOU PLEASE
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:36.467 --> 18:39.700
WHAT'S GOING ON IS THAT
WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEBODY,
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

18:39.700 --> 18:45.967
NOT THE MONEY, NOT
WHERE YOU GET MARRIED,
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

18:45.967 --> 18:47.700
ALL THAT MATTERS IS
WHO YOU'RE STANDING NEXT TO.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.133
AND THE ONLY PERSON I WANT
TO STAND NEXT TO IS YOU.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.600
SO JESSIE, EDDIE...

18:57.567 --> 18:59.300
I WISH YOU TWO
WHAT WE HAVE--

18:59.300 --> 19:02.200
TRUE LOVE THAT YOU CAN
ALWAYS COUNT ON.

19:04.667 --> 19:07.367
LET'S GO. THIS IS THEIR DAY.

19:07.367 --> 19:09.000
WE'LL HAVE OUR DAY.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.133
2 MILLION!

19:21.000 --> 19:22.467
ERIC, YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

19:22.467 --> 19:24.033
THERE'S NOTHING
TO THINK ABOUT.

19:24.033 --> 19:26.367
YEAH, HE'S IN
THE BEST POSSIBLE
PLACE THAT HE CAN BE.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.667
WHEN HE GETS OLDER,
HE'LL REALIZE WHAT
YOU'VE DONE FOR HIM.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.100
HE HATES ME.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.233
HE'S A KID. KIDS
ARE RESILIENT.

19:34.233 --> 19:37.100
YOU MUST HAVE HATED
ME A BILLION TIMES
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.300
YEAH, YOU NEVER TRIED
TO GET RID OF ME.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.600
SHH.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.233
HA HA, VERY FUNNY.

19:43.233 --> 19:46.033
THANKS FOR TRYING
TO CHEER ME UP,
GUYS, BUT...

19:46.033 --> 19:47.800
I THINK I NEED
TO BE ALONE.

19:55.367 --> 19:57.600
I'M VERY MAD AT YOU.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.200
I KNOW.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.867
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

20:23.033 --> 20:24.200
HEY.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.033
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

20:26.033 --> 20:28.100
YOU. HER. THIS.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.800
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.200
YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.000
CAN I AT LEAST
HAVE THE GRAPES?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.734
KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.000
THEY'RE ALREADY OFF.
