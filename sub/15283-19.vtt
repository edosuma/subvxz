WEBVTT

00:07.630 --> 00:09.260
I'm telling you, you're gonna love it.

00:09.820 --> 00:10.700
Do you think so?

00:10.735 --> 00:11.455
Yeah.

00:11.490 --> 00:12.235
Look, it's great.

00:12.270 --> 00:14.020
I saw it forever ago on vhs.

00:14.055 --> 00:14.730
Campy.

00:15.070 --> 00:15.570
Fun.

00:23.770 --> 00:24.380
2.

00:25.090 --> 00:25.610
Thank you.

00:26.050 --> 00:27.025
Enjoy the show, you guys.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.110
Enjoy the show.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.160
Ah, don't worry, it's not that scary.

00:35.195 --> 00:36.150
That's lame.

00:36.590 --> 00:39.030
I... I mean it's...
It's kind of scary,

00:39.065 --> 00:40.670
But, uh, mostly funny, you know?

00:41.050 --> 00:41.745
How funny?

00:41.780 --> 00:43.580
Well, it's... heh.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.900
Just don't spill it, Jesse.

00:51.770 --> 00:52.940
Jesse...

00:57.750 --> 00:58.625
Where do you want?

00:58.660 --> 00:59.970
It doesn't matter to me.

01:00.360 --> 01:00.835
There?

01:00.870 --> 01:02.040
No, that's too close.

01:02.075 --> 01:03.262
Thought it didn't matter.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.415
Well, just not too close.

01:04.450 --> 01:06.340
You know you're gonna fall asleep anyhow.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.090
What? Ok, stop.

02:16.610 --> 02:17.160
Air.

02:18.710 --> 02:20.240
And I'm getting razor burn.

02:27.980 --> 02:29.100
What? Oh, my god!

02:32.980 --> 02:34.570
Fire! Fire!

02:34.970 --> 02:36.070
Come on, let's go. Get up.

02:51.470 --> 02:52.280
Move, man!

02:53.100 --> 02:54.190
There's the fire exit!

03:01.000 --> 03:01.890
Cathy, run!

03:12.340 --> 03:13.890
Help! Somebody help us!

03:26.900 --> 03:27.750
Jesse! Mom!

03:28.500 --> 03:29.690
Jesse, where are you?!

03:40.220 --> 03:41.900
This is news footage from a movie theater

03:41.935 --> 03:44.332
In Royal, Indiana, population 2,000.

03:44.367 --> 03:46.730
Earlier tonight 19 people were killed.

03:46.765 --> 03:47.715
And they're sure it's arson?

03:47.750 --> 03:51.030
Yeah. 2 days ago the same thing
happened at the local recreation center.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.015
12 victims, no survivors.

03:53.050 --> 03:55.515
I heard about that. Yeah,
it was all over the news.

03:55.550 --> 03:57.945
There were some details
that didn't make the news.

03:57.980 --> 04:01.445
A week and a half earlier there were
some fires at a convenience store,

04:01.480 --> 04:04.910
A local restaurant. Luckily, it was
after hours and no one was hurt.

04:04.945 --> 04:09.160
So whoever set these went from
no victims to 31 in 2 weeks.

04:09.195 --> 04:10.532
That's a hell of an escalation.

04:10.567 --> 04:11.968
Why didn't they call us in sooner?

04:12.003 --> 04:13.491
The local police and fire department

04:13.526 --> 04:15.318
Knew they were dealing with an arsonist,

04:15.353 --> 04:17.110
But they had no idea he'd become a killer.

04:17.144 --> 04:18.365
Most arsonists don't.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.555
They just like setting fires.

04:19.589 --> 04:22.150
Any deaths that occur are
almost always accidental.

04:22.540 --> 04:24.415
31 victims is not an accident.

04:24.450 --> 04:26.080
The police chief knows he made a mistake.

04:27.100 --> 04:27.905
And he learned the hard way

04:27.940 --> 04:30.000
That even though not all
arsonists are killers,

04:30.035 --> 04:31.450
They do have one thing in common...

04:31.850 --> 04:34.650
Once they start, they can't stop.

05:13.550 --> 05:14.795
Tennessee Williams said,

05:14.830 --> 05:16.760
"We all live in a house on fire.

05:17.190 --> 05:20.540
No fire department to call, no way out. "

05:20.860 --> 05:23.480
Based on the limited population of royal,

05:23.515 --> 05:26.100
The unsub is most likely a local male

05:26.135 --> 05:27.912
Between the ages of 17 and 30.

05:27.947 --> 05:29.690
What, arson is a sexist industry?

05:29.725 --> 05:30.825
For the most part, yeah.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.975
Only 12% of arsonists are female.

05:33.010 --> 05:35.440
Apparently women just aren't
inclined to burn things.

05:35.475 --> 05:37.085
Let's go with the numbers. Focus on males.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.910
Well, we can scratch hero complex
off the list.

05:38.945 --> 05:40.635
He hasn't left anyone to save.

05:40.670 --> 05:43.670
Yeah, but we can't rule out firefighters
and other first responders.

05:43.705 --> 05:46.670
How's about I do a background check
on all local firefighters and emts?

05:46.705 --> 05:47.817
And flag anyone with a history

05:47.852 --> 05:49.096
Of being first on the scene.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.305
Or anyone with a juvenile record

05:50.340 --> 05:53.375
That includes vandalism or
small nuisance fires.

05:53.410 --> 05:56.360
I will look at everything from
firebug to flamethrower.

05:56.395 --> 05:57.815
Did you check out the news footage?

05:57.850 --> 05:59.750
I want the word out that we'd like to see

05:59.785 --> 06:01.615
Any personal videos or photos of the fire.

06:01.650 --> 06:04.280
Arsonists like to watch,
and if our unsub stuck around,

06:04.350 --> 06:05.510
maybe somebody will recognize him.
I'm on it.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.930
Locals find anything in their call logs

06:07.965 --> 06:09.375
That resemble the unsub's m. o.?

06:09.410 --> 06:10.990
I mean, he may have staged practice runs.

06:11.025 --> 06:12.305
According to the fire chief's report

06:12.340 --> 06:14.160
There was nothing similar in the past year.

06:14.195 --> 06:15.942
Garcia, extend your search statewide.

06:15.977 --> 06:17.655
The unsub may have done his practicing

06:17.690 --> 06:19.930
Far enough away so as
not to arouse suspicion.

06:19.965 --> 06:21.985
Thank you. I will cast a wide net, sir.

06:22.020 --> 06:24.150
I grew up in a small town.
People are gonna assume

06:24.185 --> 06:25.705
anyone we question is guilty.

06:25.740 --> 06:28.810
The last thing we want is for this
to turn into a witch hunt.

06:28.845 --> 06:30.310
It's exactly what this is.
We're just gonna have to

06:30.345 --> 06:31.940
keep the locals from realizing it.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.545
Garcia, I want you to find out
everything that you can

06:34.580 --> 06:37.410
about the 31 victims, and I don't
mean just their paper trail.

06:37.445 --> 06:39.980
I need to know everyone related to them,

06:40.015 --> 06:41.105
Everybody they owed money to,

06:41.140 --> 06:42.505
Everybody they had an argument with.

06:42.540 --> 06:43.835
Sir, if I'm hearing you right,

06:43.870 --> 06:45.325
you're saying I'm the witch hunter.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.780
That's exactly what I'm saying.

06:58.510 --> 06:59.485
Chief Carlson,

06:59.520 --> 07:01.310
Agent Jareau, this is Agent Hotchner.

07:01.710 --> 07:02.590
Thank you for coming.

07:03.330 --> 07:04.905
I know I should have called you in earlier.

07:04.940 --> 07:08.670
So... anything you need,
anything at all, you got it.

07:08.705 --> 07:10.657
What we're going to need most is your help.

07:10.692 --> 07:12.575
It's a horrible tragedy, and it's gonna take

07:12.610 --> 07:14.300
Everyone working together to
prevent another one.

07:16.090 --> 07:17.630
You think he's gonna try to do it again?

07:17.665 --> 07:18.365
We know he will.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.570
And with his escalating timeline,

07:19.605 --> 07:20.870
It's gonna be soon.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.420
We, uh...

07:31.310 --> 07:33.030
We didn't have enough room in the hospital

07:33.065 --> 07:34.070
For everyone.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.690
This... This way, please.

07:47.650 --> 07:48.710
Doc Rawlings.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.105
You're the FBI agents.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.030
Well, thank god Carlson called you.

07:55.730 --> 07:57.560
I'm Agent Hotchner, this is Agent Jareau.

07:58.780 --> 08:01.395
That's Mary Elise. She lost her husband.

08:01.430 --> 08:03.735
That's Alice Starrett with Chief Carlson.

08:03.770 --> 08:06.040
Her parents were both at the movie theater.

08:06.540 --> 08:09.650
Mike... His oldest son and
his girlfriend were there.

08:09.685 --> 08:10.895
So was my nephew.

08:10.930 --> 08:13.160
Everybody in the room lost somebody.

08:13.340 --> 08:15.790
When I first heard about it,
I just came right here.

08:15.825 --> 08:18.170
I had my nurses bring equipment,
set up triage.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.530
Nobody needed it. They were...

08:22.200 --> 08:23.235
They were all dead.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.480
Every single one of them.

08:24.870 --> 08:27.205
I wish I could tell you this is
the worst of it, but I can't.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.330
When he strikes again, he's gonna be
aiming for even more victims.

08:30.660 --> 08:31.425
My god.

08:31.460 --> 08:32.755
You need to send everybody home.

08:32.789 --> 08:34.600
Large gatherings like this are a bad idea.

08:34.635 --> 08:36.365
All right. Dr. Rawlings.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.765
When I spoke to the police chief,

08:37.799 --> 08:39.760
He said that you know everyone in royal.

08:39.980 --> 08:41.995
Well, pretty much. I grew up here.

08:42.030 --> 08:44.010
I inherited my father's practice.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.310
I delivered 11 of those people
lying in there.

08:48.020 --> 08:50.730
There is a strong probability that
the killer is local.

08:51.210 --> 08:53.400
You think somebody from royal did this?

08:53.435 --> 08:54.885
It's usually the case.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.020
We want to handle this investigation
as gently as possible,

08:58.055 --> 08:59.495
without pointing fingers.

08:59.530 --> 09:02.820
What we're asking you to decide
is what's more important,

09:02.855 --> 09:04.580
people's privacy or their safety?

09:35.080 --> 09:38.150
Most of the victims died of
smoke inhalation, thank god.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.240
A few of them were trampled.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.840
My cousin Gary and his wife Linda.

09:44.770 --> 09:45.870
If you need some time...

09:46.870 --> 09:48.990
We're talking gasoline and matches.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.555
And this was the point of origin.

09:51.590 --> 09:53.090
The second one was in the lobby?

09:53.910 --> 09:55.530
This one burned the longest.

09:55.565 --> 09:56.470
Slower, too.

09:57.020 --> 09:59.050
Less oxygen, less fuel.

10:00.370 --> 10:01.790
He used a lot more gas in the lobby.

10:01.825 --> 10:03.497
Place went up like a haystack.

10:03.532 --> 10:05.170
What about the sprinklers?

10:06.490 --> 10:08.630
Bastard turned off the main water line.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.290
You know, the unsub could have
set this fire first.

10:19.810 --> 10:21.155
Lobby burned harder and faster,

10:21.190 --> 10:22.500
Forcing the victims out this way,

10:23.230 --> 10:24.475
Where he'd already blocked the exit.

10:24.510 --> 10:27.620
And where the smoke from the
slower-burning fire had already built up.

10:28.390 --> 10:30.900
And whoever did do this knew that
even if the fire department

10:30.935 --> 10:33.170
got here in time to stop the fires...

10:34.810 --> 10:36.265
Cathy!

10:36.300 --> 10:38.240
They still wouldn't have been
able to save them.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.930
Me and Daniel are both volunteers.

10:48.965 --> 10:50.180
The whole company is.

10:51.210 --> 10:52.720
Got about 20 firefighters,

10:53.040 --> 10:55.225
Plus our own ladder truck and pumper.

10:55.260 --> 10:57.410
An EMT runs a 2-Person crew 24/7.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.850
We managed to get it out pretty fast.

11:01.190 --> 11:02.380
Not fast enough.

11:02.710 --> 11:03.730
All those people.

11:05.070 --> 11:06.525
Who would have so much hate?

11:06.560 --> 11:09.280
Someone whose rage has been
building for years.

11:09.315 --> 11:10.825
But what he did, I...

11:10.860 --> 11:13.565
The unsub knew exactly what he was doing.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.270
He's been practicing for a long time.

11:16.305 --> 11:18.375
Nuisance fires, vandalism.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.405
He may have even burned himself.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.420
Well, that sounds like every teenage boy
who's ever grown up in Royal.

11:23.455 --> 11:24.515
I don't know if you noticed,

11:24.550 --> 11:27.250
But there's really not a lot to do here.

11:27.710 --> 11:30.040
You have our reports.
All the records are in there.

11:30.075 --> 11:31.525
Maybe so,

11:31.560 --> 11:33.780
But we all know there are times
when things...

11:34.560 --> 11:35.970
Don't get reported.

11:36.860 --> 11:38.290
Times when you're...

11:38.920 --> 11:40.660
Just trying to protect someone,

11:41.730 --> 11:43.150
Just trying to, um,

11:43.640 --> 11:45.500
Make the situation go away.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.295
We're just trying to help people out.

11:49.330 --> 11:51.500
Sometimes the best way
to do that is to forget

11:51.535 --> 11:52.800
that it ever happened.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.630
We're gonna need to know about those times.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.800
I have been through every piece
of footage I could find.

12:03.835 --> 12:05.345
No one sticks out at the fires.

12:05.380 --> 12:07.720
No one appears to be
inappropriately voyeuristic.

12:07.755 --> 12:09.170
No one with bandages.

12:09.205 --> 12:10.395
Yeah. Garcia?

12:10.430 --> 12:14.090
No firebug firefighter,
no flammable juvie records,

12:14.125 --> 12:17.175
However, of the 128 reported instances

12:17.210 --> 12:19.320
of petty larceny and vandalism
in the last year,

12:19.355 --> 12:21.430
there are a few names
that sort of stick out,

12:21.465 --> 12:23.505
So I'm emailing you those photos.

12:23.540 --> 12:27.510
I also have a pattern of small gasoline fires
about 300 miles away.

12:27.545 --> 12:28.875
A town called Franklin.

12:28.910 --> 12:31.485
Got a, uh, trash can fire, a Christmas tree,

12:31.520 --> 12:34.060
And an abandoned shed.
And I sent you that file.

12:34.095 --> 12:35.925
Given the 500-Mile search radius,

12:35.960 --> 12:38.660
There's bound to be a certain percentage
of nuisance fires.

12:38.695 --> 12:40.860
We can't necessarily attribute
that to our unsub.

12:40.895 --> 12:44.835
With a gasoline accelerant...

12:44.870 --> 12:46.650
Our unsub and this guy. Nice work, Garcia.

12:46.685 --> 12:47.635
What about the victims?

12:47.670 --> 12:50.660
Well... given that I've had less than
8 hours, I can't really...

12:50.695 --> 12:52.640
I appreciate the time constraint.
What have you found?

12:52.675 --> 12:55.730
Uh, a mixture of ages and genders.

12:55.765 --> 12:56.765
Mostly local.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.595
A cousin visiting from a nearby town.

12:58.630 --> 13:00.960
Is there any crossover between the victims
and the 2 towns, Garcia?

13:00.995 --> 13:02.807
Hey, it's a little teeny tiny town.

13:02.842 --> 13:04.620
There's nothing but crossover. Um...

13:05.320 --> 13:07.985
Alex Nagel... He was killed
in the rec center.

13:08.020 --> 13:11.640
Now, not only was Nagel an upstanding member
of the local church,

13:11.675 --> 13:14.430
he also owned quite a bit of
real estate in Royal,

13:14.465 --> 13:15.665
including the movie theater.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.805
Windy Kennedy was killed
at the movie theater.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.020
She was a single mom. She worked
a double shift at the local discount store.

13:21.055 --> 13:24.250
And she still managed to find time
to volunteer at the rec center.

13:24.285 --> 13:26.830
I also have a third-Grade teacher,
third cousins,

13:26.865 --> 13:28.405
and at least 3 potential affairs.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.680
You're gonna have to start weeding out
some of these, Garcia.

13:30.715 --> 13:32.630
Third cousins and religious affiliations

13:32.665 --> 13:34.072
are probably not gonna help us.

13:34.107 --> 13:35.533
I need to know who had enemies,

13:35.568 --> 13:37.009
who had secrets, who was a target.

13:37.044 --> 13:38.415
Oh, with all due respect, sir,

13:38.450 --> 13:41.870
my brain muscles are comfortable
with being intuitive with information,

13:41.905 --> 13:44.100
Not people. Looking at people like that

13:44.135 --> 13:45.630
is not part of my job description.

13:46.060 --> 13:46.895
I'm not a profiler.

13:46.930 --> 13:49.000
Well, you're gonna have to be.
We don't have much time.

13:49.780 --> 13:51.050
You two look into the nuisance fires.

13:51.085 --> 13:52.250
Garcia, stay on the radio.

13:53.870 --> 13:57.180
"Though I walk through the valley

13:57.215 --> 13:58.600
"Of the shadow of death,

13:59.620 --> 14:02.020
I will fear no evil,

14:02.055 --> 14:04.385
For thou art with me. "

14:04.420 --> 14:06.650
You said large gatherings
aren't a good idea,

14:06.970 --> 14:08.710
but this service... Is not a target.

14:08.745 --> 14:10.450
The unsub wouldn't want to interrupt

14:10.485 --> 14:12.320
The grief he created.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.200
But he may want to watch it.

14:14.890 --> 14:17.500
We're looking for inappropriate behavior
for the situation.

14:17.535 --> 14:19.570
Too much emotion, too little emotion.

14:19.605 --> 14:21.332
Someone who keeps to himself.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.060
Watching others' reactions.

14:23.350 --> 14:25.410
Someone who insinuates himself too closely

14:25.445 --> 14:26.985
Into someone else's grief.

14:27.020 --> 14:28.380
We're focusing on known offenders

14:28.415 --> 14:29.960
With a propensity for arson.

14:30.650 --> 14:32.235
Brian miller, 18 years old,

14:32.270 --> 14:34.720
And he's been vandalizing property
for almost all 18 of them.

14:35.620 --> 14:38.330
"... Staff, they comfort me... "

14:38.365 --> 14:39.855
John Clayton, 27.

14:39.890 --> 14:41.465
He set fire to his neighbor's garage,

14:41.500 --> 14:44.150
Claimed it was an accident, but he filed
a complaint the previous month

14:44.185 --> 14:45.772
that the neighbor killed his dog.

14:45.807 --> 14:47.360
"Thou anointest my head with oil... "

14:49.670 --> 14:52.080
"My cup runneth over.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.055
"Surely goodness and mercy

14:56.090 --> 14:59.830
"Shall follow me all the days of my life...

15:01.550 --> 15:05.470
And I will dwell in the house
of the lord forever. "

15:05.770 --> 15:06.730
Yeah, JJ.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.000
People, please.

15:12.035 --> 15:13.010
Calm down.

15:13.340 --> 15:14.480
I'm sure it's nothing.

15:16.930 --> 15:17.570
Thanks.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.590
He's not here.

15:46.650 --> 15:48.665
This doesn't make sense.
He should have been at the memorial.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.240
He shouldn't have been able to
resist seeing the damage he'd done.

16:01.220 --> 16:02.060
Captain.

16:02.610 --> 16:03.460
Hey, Captain.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.370
Can I get a word?

16:06.610 --> 16:07.850
It started in the kitchen.

16:08.730 --> 16:10.320
Looks like he came around to the back

16:10.355 --> 16:11.910
And tossed a cocktail through the window.

16:11.945 --> 16:13.165
Different delivery system.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.250
That's a big deviance from his m. o.

16:16.020 --> 16:17.400
But perfect for this location.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.365
I don't know, though.
With a space this small

16:19.400 --> 16:21.900
he shouldn't have been able to
pour the gasoline without being noticed.

16:21.935 --> 16:23.390
Nobody saw a thing?

16:24.170 --> 16:26.270
Witnesses say they heard an explosion.

16:26.690 --> 16:28.510
Well, I guarantee he stuck around to watch.

16:32.630 --> 16:33.530
Boom.

16:33.850 --> 16:35.720
The bar matches his previous locations.

16:35.755 --> 16:37.177
It's another local hot spot.

16:37.212 --> 16:38.696
Only 5 victims this time.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.180
Why lower the body count?

16:40.570 --> 16:41.400
Rossi.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.110
There's something else that's different.

16:46.070 --> 16:47.100
The front and back?

16:47.580 --> 16:49.870
He really wanted to make sure
nobody got out this time.

16:49.905 --> 16:51.932
But why bother? No one made it
out of the other ones.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.960
Maybe he knew the fire department
would show up sooner.

16:53.995 --> 16:55.337
Yeah, we're faster now.

16:55.372 --> 16:56.645
Practice makes perfect.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.500
What the hell difference does it make?

16:58.535 --> 17:00.285
And what good are you guys doing us?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.680
You see chains, figure he didn't
want anyone to get out.

17:03.420 --> 17:04.819
I could have told you that.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.900
We're not criticizing anyone.

17:07.230 --> 17:09.025
Our job is to look at the same things you do

17:09.060 --> 17:11.930
But to try to see them from
a different perspective.

17:11.964 --> 17:12.724
Sure.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.075
Look, all due respect, captain,

17:14.109 --> 17:15.730
but you look at that chain
and you say the killer

17:15.765 --> 17:17.569
wanted to make sure
nobody got out, right?

17:17.910 --> 17:19.900
We look at that chain and
we see a little more.

17:20.329 --> 17:22.690
That chain is different than
the first two fires.

17:22.990 --> 17:25.505
Now, either we're looking at
an entirely new arsonist

17:25.540 --> 17:28.520
or this unsub wanted to make
absolutely certain nobody got out.

17:28.555 --> 17:30.590
Now, if this is true, that means
something changed.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.530
Maybe his emotions changed.
Maybe his agenda.

17:32.565 --> 17:33.450
But something.

17:33.990 --> 17:35.125
See, this chain tells us

17:35.160 --> 17:37.130
this is the fire that matters.

17:37.530 --> 17:39.710
This fire is gonna help us catch this guy.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.420
My father was chief here for over 30 years.

17:48.260 --> 17:51.110
Last 2 weeks I lost more folks
that he did in his whole career.

17:51.145 --> 17:52.260
Agent Prentiss?

17:53.200 --> 17:54.165
Sorry.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.255
Chief, what do we know?

17:55.290 --> 17:58.370
4 dead. The bartender Nancy
is still hanging on.

17:58.405 --> 17:59.265
How bad is she?

17:59.300 --> 18:00.770
Pretty bad. She was unconscious

18:00.805 --> 18:01.655
when they took her.

18:01.690 --> 18:03.355
If we get a chance, we need to talk to her.

18:03.390 --> 18:05.020
I was off duty. I heard it on the radio!

18:05.055 --> 18:06.720
God, I'm sorry, Tina.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.170
I just talked to him on the phone.

18:09.205 --> 18:11.085
He said he was coming home.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.620
Tina's fiance Jason owned the bar.

18:13.655 --> 18:16.120
He was inside when it all happened.

18:17.870 --> 18:19.490
When's it gonna stop?

18:20.150 --> 18:21.135
Anything?

18:21.170 --> 18:22.780
We got a completely different m. o.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.605
Assuming it's not a copycat,

18:25.640 --> 18:27.985
We know why the unsub wasn't at the funeral.

18:28.020 --> 18:31.180
Someone in that bar was more important
to him than anything else.

18:31.215 --> 18:32.850
Morgan, call Garcia.
Tell her we need to know

18:32.885 --> 18:34.505
absolutely everything there is to know

18:34.540 --> 18:36.465
about these 5 victims and
we need to know it now.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.200
I'll go tell Chief Carlson we want to
talk to his officers.

18:45.790 --> 18:46.605
Hello?

18:46.640 --> 18:48.745
Hey, how's miss smart and sexy doing today?

18:48.780 --> 18:50.815
Fair warning, cupcake.
As much as I love you

18:50.850 --> 18:54.500
and our witty banter,
I am all out of witty and banter

18:54.535 --> 18:56.690
and am struggling with love.

18:56.725 --> 18:57.485
What's wrong, baby?

18:57.520 --> 18:59.700
I am standing at the crossroads of 31 lives

18:59.735 --> 19:01.260
and what I see is a train wreck.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.440
You want a little tour? This is
what I mean. Here we go.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.725
Flip Phillips...

19:04.760 --> 19:06.905
He beat his wife. It went on for years.

19:06.940 --> 19:08.940
Although you wouldn't know it
if you looked at the police reports,

19:08.975 --> 19:11.270
because that's one of the perks
of being the Mayor.

19:11.520 --> 19:15.170
David Alexander... He sued
his boss for $5 million

19:15.205 --> 19:17.035
over something totally lame,

19:17.070 --> 19:18.705
And what makes it even more erotic

19:18.740 --> 19:20.540
is he was sleeping with the boss' daughter.

19:20.575 --> 19:22.337
And then there is... Where is she?

19:22.372 --> 19:24.296
Oh! One of the town councilwomen,

19:24.331 --> 19:26.185
now, she had a terminally ill husband

19:26.220 --> 19:28.860
and also 3 boyfriends
under the age of 20.

19:29.870 --> 19:31.470
I want to believe that the world

19:31.505 --> 19:33.035
is just teeming with awesome people,

19:33.070 --> 19:35.570
but all of this is giving me great pause.

19:36.370 --> 19:37.725
I want to go back to cyberspace.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.075
I'm sorry, sweetheart, not yet.

19:39.110 --> 19:40.390
I got a few more names for you.

19:41.880 --> 19:42.930
Ok.

19:44.070 --> 19:45.250
Just, um...

19:45.830 --> 19:47.425
Please tell me they're still alive.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.020
I wish I could do that, Garcia.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.980
All of the first 4 fires...
The convenience store,

20:02.015 --> 20:04.200
the restaurant, the rec center,
and the movie theater,

20:04.235 --> 20:06.392
are indicative of a revenge arsonist.

20:06.427 --> 20:08.733
That's someone who's seeking retaliation

20:08.768 --> 20:11.040
for an injustice, whether
real or imagined.

20:11.470 --> 20:14.520
Revenge arsonists often target
group headquarters,

20:14.555 --> 20:16.812
such as churches or government buildings.

20:16.847 --> 20:19.233
This unsub has chosen local gathering places

20:19.268 --> 20:21.585
with large numbers of
potential victims inside.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.220
It's clear to us that he's chosen to
target this community as a whole.

20:24.255 --> 20:26.412
That tells us that the unsub is a local,

20:26.447 --> 20:28.570
someone who lives or grew up in Royal.

20:28.605 --> 20:30.630
But he feels like an outsider.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.090
As if this community has wronged him
in some type of way.

20:33.125 --> 20:34.840
These fires are just his way of striking back,

20:34.875 --> 20:36.365
trying to draw attention to himself.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.565
These fires not only killed innocent people,

20:38.600 --> 20:42.350
they also gave the unsub a sense of
power over the community.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.115
But somehow those fires were lacking.

20:48.150 --> 20:50.920
They didn't exact the correct measure
of punishment

20:50.955 --> 20:52.145
or attract enough attention.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.450
Or they didn't attract the attention
of the right person.

20:54.485 --> 20:55.775
So with the bar fire,

20:55.810 --> 20:58.060
he didn't increase the number of victims.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.500
He reduced them.

21:08.490 --> 21:10.235
That's why the third fire is key.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.830
He's not striking out at the community
as a whole anymore.

21:12.865 --> 21:15.640
He's now striking out at
one or more individuals.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.495
You're sure it's the same guy?

21:23.530 --> 21:25.950
The odds of another arsonist
in a town this small

21:25.985 --> 21:27.295
are almost negligible.

21:27.330 --> 21:29.020
That's why we need to concentrate
on these victims.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.505
These 5 will hold the key.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.020
So all we gotta do is just figure out

21:32.055 --> 21:33.500
who would have wanted to hurt them.

21:33.535 --> 21:34.795
It may not be that simple.

21:34.830 --> 21:37.880
This type of rage tends to stem from
things that people keep buried.

21:38.060 --> 21:39.925
Things they just don't talk about.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.550
Which is why we're gonna have to dig deeply.

21:41.840 --> 21:42.760
Understood.

21:54.780 --> 21:55.480
Excuse me.

21:56.680 --> 21:57.490
How is she?

21:57.780 --> 21:59.950
We couldn't even send her
to the burn unit in Gary.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.090
It wouldn't have mattered.

22:01.125 --> 22:01.970
We'll be brief.

22:10.130 --> 22:11.170
Nancy.

22:12.110 --> 22:13.090
It's me.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.225
The FBI is here.

22:15.260 --> 22:17.910
Nancy, can you tell us what happened?

22:18.760 --> 22:20.940
There was a crash...

22:21.240 --> 22:23.100
Then everything exploded.

22:23.135 --> 22:24.020
Cocktail.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.280
What happened before that?

22:27.730 --> 22:31.140
Was there anything unusual
or out of the ordinary?

22:31.175 --> 22:34.140
Did anyone come in or leave?

22:35.610 --> 22:37.610
Just Jason.

22:38.270 --> 22:39.440
Jason, the owner?

22:40.530 --> 22:43.000
He came for the money.

22:43.890 --> 22:45.440
Like always.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.510
He's dead, isn't he?

22:48.980 --> 22:50.670
Nancy, what about customers?

22:50.990 --> 22:54.140
Was there anyone there
who seemed anxious or upset?

22:55.570 --> 22:57.055
He would have kept to himself,

22:57.090 --> 22:59.455
taken a seat away from the other customers.

22:59.490 --> 23:02.090
Maybe he was checking his watch
or his cell phone.

23:02.125 --> 23:03.930
There was a guy...

23:04.390 --> 23:05.945
He seemed angry.

23:05.980 --> 23:07.940
He kept changing seats.

23:07.975 --> 23:09.865
Ok. We have to stop.

23:09.900 --> 23:11.970
Who was that, Nancy?
You know his name?

23:12.005 --> 23:13.250
Now.

23:34.430 --> 23:36.455
So tell us about the bar victims.

23:36.490 --> 23:38.505
All right. Hilda and Roger Drake.

23:38.540 --> 23:40.520
She was a teacher, he sold insurance.

23:40.820 --> 23:41.755
Friends, enemies?

23:41.790 --> 23:43.845
Oh, no, nothing like that.
They seemed sweet.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.530
Their biggest problem was finding
baby names. Hilda was pregnant.

23:46.565 --> 23:47.695
Are you sure?

23:47.730 --> 23:49.530
The M.E. hasn't even started yet.

23:49.565 --> 23:51.307
No, people in Royal take out ads.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.015
"Lordy, lordy, looks who's 40."

23:53.050 --> 23:56.010
"Ask Jane what she was doing at the
American Legion on Friday night. "

23:56.045 --> 23:57.265
That's just wrong.

23:57.300 --> 23:58.885
That's small-Town life for you.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.660
Your business is everybody's business.

24:00.695 --> 24:02.100
There was a belly watch on Hilda.

24:03.770 --> 24:05.520
Uh, what about Eric Gall?

24:05.555 --> 24:07.235
Oh, Eric. He was a boozer.

24:07.270 --> 24:09.595
He spent most of his time at pop's place.

24:09.630 --> 24:12.270
I've got a few drunk and disorderlies,
but he seems harmless.

24:12.305 --> 24:13.947
And given the amount of rounds he bought,

24:13.982 --> 24:15.590
it's safe to say
the whole town love him.

24:15.830 --> 24:16.560
It's Hotch.

24:17.790 --> 24:18.850
Yeah, what's up?

24:22.260 --> 24:22.845
Ok.

24:22.880 --> 24:23.740
I got it.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.915
Ok, well, they managed to speak
to the bartender.

24:25.950 --> 24:28.125
According to her, there was a guy
there before the fire.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.300
He didn't speak to anybody
and he kept switching seats.

24:30.335 --> 24:33.217
She didn't seem to recognize him.

24:33.252 --> 24:36.100
Ok. Wait. So she knew the owner

24:36.510 --> 24:37.475
and the boozer,

24:37.510 --> 24:39.840
And the husband wouldn't have
gotten up and changed seats.

24:39.875 --> 24:41.450
If the bartender didn't recognize him,

24:41.485 --> 24:42.882
maybe he's just not from royal.

24:42.917 --> 24:44.245
That's not necessarily true.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.590
What if she knew him and
she just didn't realize it?

24:46.625 --> 24:47.535
What, like a disguise?

24:47.570 --> 24:49.615
The fire captain said the unsub
knew the layout

24:49.650 --> 24:51.780
of the movie theater. He used that
knowledge to light the fire.

24:51.815 --> 24:54.380
But at the bar, the unsub kept
changing his seats.

24:54.415 --> 24:55.870
Which would give him a better view

24:55.905 --> 24:57.707
of the entrances and exits.

24:57.742 --> 24:59.376
So he was studying the layout.

24:59.411 --> 25:01.010
He wasn't familiar with the area.

25:03.530 --> 25:05.310
What if he grew up in Royal
and he moved away?

25:05.345 --> 25:08.867
Garcia, what year was that bar built?

25:08.902 --> 25:12.390
Uh, the bar was built 5... 6 years ago.

25:12.425 --> 25:13.805
And what about the movie theater?

25:13.840 --> 25:15.315
The movie theater was built in the forties.

25:15.350 --> 25:17.820
It was a single screen, they divided it 2 years ago.

25:18.370 --> 25:20.090
Rec center was built in the late seventies.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.090
I'm gonna call Hotch.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.330
Jason Elliot opened pop's place 6 years ago

25:37.365 --> 25:39.087
when he moved to Royal from Indianapolis.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.810
Why? Does he have friends or family here?

25:40.845 --> 25:41.905
None that I could find.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.285
What about the bar? Did Jason buy it

25:43.320 --> 25:44.630
From someone, take over their business?

25:44.665 --> 25:46.240
No. Jason started the bar himself.

25:46.275 --> 25:47.695
He named it after his father,

25:47.730 --> 25:49.380
who, by the way, was his sole beneficiary.

25:49.415 --> 25:50.605
Makes sense. He was single.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.620
Well, he was single, up until
a couple days ago,

25:52.655 --> 25:55.180
because 2 days ago, Jason married...

25:55.860 --> 25:56.900
Tina Wheeler.

25:56.935 --> 25:58.185
The EMT.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.695
Yeah. I had checked her out originally

25:59.730 --> 26:02.530
as one of the first responders, but her work
records looked squeaky clean,

26:02.565 --> 26:05.080
and so I let it go until I realized
she'd married Jason,

26:05.115 --> 26:06.862
and then I did some more
aggressive digging,

26:06.897 --> 26:08.575
which I should remind you
you asked me to do,

26:08.610 --> 26:12.560
and it turns out that Tina's parents died
in a fire when she was 5.

26:12.595 --> 26:15.355
After they died, her and her brother Tommy

26:15.390 --> 26:17.650
were sent to live with their
grandparents in Royal.

26:17.685 --> 26:19.227
Send us everything you have on them.

26:19.262 --> 26:20.770
Well, that's just it. I got...

26:21.690 --> 26:23.515
I got plenty on Tina,

26:23.550 --> 26:26.080
but I can't really find anything
on her brother.

26:26.115 --> 26:28.665
Tina, she, uh, she lived in Royal,

26:28.700 --> 26:31.020
she went to a community college
a few towns over,

26:31.055 --> 26:32.527
got a degree, took a job,

26:32.562 --> 26:34.000
worked hard, married Jason...

26:34.035 --> 26:35.570
Uh... wait...

26:35.770 --> 26:37.145
Tommy, it's like...

26:37.180 --> 26:38.515
He just disappeared.

26:38.550 --> 26:39.850
Find him, Garcia.

27:35.230 --> 27:36.410
Lana Perry, please.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.450
Hi. This is Penelope Garcia of the FBI.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.910
I wanted to ask you some questions.

27:43.945 --> 27:45.110
You have a second?

27:45.700 --> 27:48.680
Yes. I... I wanted to ask you some questions

27:48.715 --> 27:51.660
about a student, uh,
named Tommy Wheeler.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.325
Thank you.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.750
Thank you very much.

28:05.000 --> 28:05.880
Oh, my god.

28:10.110 --> 28:12.160
Sir, I think I have something.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.760
We believe Jason Elliot may
have been the target.

28:15.795 --> 28:16.425
Jason.

28:16.460 --> 28:18.235
The bartender said that Jason
stopped by the bar

28:18.270 --> 28:21.210
at the same time each day to pick up
the cash and take it to the bank.

28:21.245 --> 28:24.150
Which would have made him an easy target
for anyone who knew his schedule.

28:24.990 --> 28:26.315
I don't get all this.

28:26.350 --> 28:27.640
Jason was a good man.

28:28.190 --> 28:29.720
It may sound corny to you,

28:29.755 --> 28:31.215
but everybody loved him.

28:31.250 --> 28:34.280
2 days ago, Jason Elliot
married Tina Wheeler.

28:34.650 --> 28:36.140
She told me about it yesterday. Uh...

28:36.850 --> 28:39.470
All the tragedies made them
not want to wait.

28:39.505 --> 28:40.825
It's a damn shame.

28:40.860 --> 28:42.990
What can you tell us about
Tina's brother Tommy?

28:45.360 --> 28:46.650
Tommy?

28:48.190 --> 28:51.350
Uh, nobody's seen him around here
in more than 10 years.

28:51.385 --> 28:53.117
Uh, we actually think they may have.

28:53.152 --> 28:54.850
They just might not recognize him.

28:54.885 --> 28:55.985
How is that possible?

28:56.020 --> 28:57.145
Well, he's aged 10 years,

28:57.180 --> 28:58.990
and he'd make sure to go unnoticed.

28:59.025 --> 28:59.775
Garcia?

28:59.810 --> 29:01.090
Tommy wheeler.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.315
Little Tommy wheeler.
You remember him?

29:04.350 --> 29:07.110
He and his sister Tina
moved to Royal when he was 5.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.055
Doc Rawlings was his pediatrician.

29:09.090 --> 29:10.930
Apparently early medical records indicated

29:10.965 --> 29:12.770
Tommy may have been emotionally unbalanced.

29:12.805 --> 29:14.290
Tommy was a little unstable.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.310
His parents dying brought that out.

29:16.345 --> 29:18.035
Granted, I don't have a medical degree,

29:18.070 --> 29:21.430
but my guess is, watching
his parents die in a fire

29:21.465 --> 29:23.617
didn't help Tommy's emotional well-being.

29:23.652 --> 29:27.286
What about Tina? How did
the fires affect her?

29:27.321 --> 29:30.920
Uh... Tina wasn't as damaged
by it as he was.

29:30.955 --> 29:32.172
Uh, she adjusted more quickly.

29:32.207 --> 29:33.355
She was Tommy's lifeline.

29:33.390 --> 29:35.700
She was more than that.
In a situation like this...

29:35.735 --> 29:37.235
No parents, new environment,

29:37.270 --> 29:40.120
and grandparents probably
too old to take care of them,

29:40.155 --> 29:42.140
Tina became Tommy's whole world.

29:42.175 --> 29:43.807
Sister, mother, family.

29:43.842 --> 29:45.405
They were very close.

29:45.440 --> 29:48.360
Close enough that Tina distorted
Tommy's love map.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.980
The way an individual gives
or receives love...

29:51.015 --> 29:52.135
Their love map...

29:52.170 --> 29:54.810
Is established by the age of 6.

29:55.190 --> 29:56.335
With the death of the parents,

29:56.370 --> 29:59.130
Tommy's love map revolved
exclusively around Tina.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.507
Yeah, it was like they were
in their own little world.

30:01.542 --> 30:03.850
By the time they were 8,
they even had their own language.

30:04.690 --> 30:05.755
It was a bit disturbing.

30:05.790 --> 30:08.150
But understandable.
Perfectly understandable.

30:08.870 --> 30:09.725
Maybe.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.615
So what happened?

30:10.650 --> 30:12.140
What do you think happened?
People talked.

30:12.175 --> 30:13.630
It's the only real occupation in Royal.

30:13.665 --> 30:14.840
There were rumors.

30:15.190 --> 30:17.690
It was that Tommy and Tina
were too close.

30:17.725 --> 30:18.685
Tommy Wheeler!

30:18.720 --> 30:20.750
My god, that's your sister!

30:21.960 --> 30:23.215
Nothing was ever confirmed, though.

30:23.250 --> 30:26.300
No, it wasn't. But, then,
the truth didn't matter.

30:26.970 --> 30:28.720
After the rumors started,

30:28.940 --> 30:30.190
things got ugly.

30:30.650 --> 30:31.655
People pointed fingers,

30:31.690 --> 30:33.215
Tommy got expelled from school.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.850
Based on nothing but hearsay.

30:34.885 --> 30:36.450
Not true. The school had cause.

30:36.485 --> 30:37.445
Garcia... No, they didn't.

30:37.480 --> 30:40.900
I spoke to his teacher. She told me how
the whole school and the whole town

30:40.935 --> 30:42.780
turned against him, based on
nothing but a rumor.

30:42.815 --> 30:44.405
She also told me another rumor. Garcia...

30:44.440 --> 30:47.450
In this one, 14-Year-Old Tommy was
beaten within an inch of his life

30:47.485 --> 30:49.450
by adults. Grown men.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.560
I didn't hear about it until after the fact.

30:52.910 --> 30:53.985
There was nothing I could do.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.985
Broken bones, punctured lung.
All because of a rumor.

30:57.020 --> 30:59.950
I couldn't go after anyone
based on only my suspicions.

31:00.430 --> 31:02.390
Nobody was talking about it,

31:02.425 --> 31:03.790
not even Tommy.

31:04.470 --> 31:05.515
I spoke to his grandparents

31:05.550 --> 31:06.995
and told them what to do.

31:07.030 --> 31:08.405
Yeah. So they moved Tommy

31:08.440 --> 31:09.695
to a Colorado boarding school,

31:09.730 --> 31:11.850
and they cut off all ties
between him and his sister.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.090
It was as if Tommy never even existed.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.270
It was for the best.

31:16.940 --> 31:17.990
They would have killed him.

31:19.350 --> 31:21.540
If what Garcia said is true,
then this town's actions

31:21.575 --> 31:24.290
went a long way towards
making Tommy who he is.

31:27.770 --> 31:29.450
We need to talk to Tina.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.350
Go on around, take the back.

31:44.385 --> 31:45.170
Yes, sir.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.200
Tina!

31:52.570 --> 31:53.720
It's me, Brad!

31:55.800 --> 31:56.800
Tina?

31:58.760 --> 32:01.040
Morgan, find out if Tina
showed up for work today.

32:07.440 --> 32:08.550
Tina?

32:11.140 --> 32:12.010
Tina?

32:13.200 --> 32:14.220
Tina?

32:16.870 --> 32:17.930
Clear!

32:21.810 --> 32:22.950
Nobody's here.

32:26.250 --> 32:27.380
Yeah, Morgan.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.600
Tina didn't show up for her shift. Thanks.

32:30.635 --> 32:32.070
She left her cell phone.

32:33.010 --> 32:34.430
You think it was Tommy?

32:35.600 --> 32:36.780
Yes?

32:39.070 --> 32:40.430
Tommy?

32:42.160 --> 32:43.850
Put out an APB for Tommy and Tina.

32:43.885 --> 32:45.540
Close all roads in and out of royal.

32:46.170 --> 32:48.020
No, no, he loves her.

32:48.380 --> 32:49.110
He wouldn't hurt her.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.035
According to his former teacher,

32:57.070 --> 32:59.780
Tommy Wheeler enrolled in a
Colorado boarding school

32:59.815 --> 33:01.145
under the name Thomas Boren.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.610
That's his dead mother's maiden name.

33:02.645 --> 33:04.585
I tracked down his records.

33:04.620 --> 33:08.400
He was at that school for half a year
before he landed in juvie,

33:08.435 --> 33:09.875
where he resided for the next 3.

33:09.910 --> 33:12.480
His psych evals during his stay
were less than stellar.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.245
So how mad do you think he is?

33:15.280 --> 33:17.030
Well, if I was him I'd be pretty mad.

33:17.065 --> 33:17.755
Oh, god.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.980
Garcia, the town did turn against him.

33:20.015 --> 33:21.370
I mean, that's not an excuse.

33:21.405 --> 33:23.510
No, not Tommy. Hotch.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.375
I mean, he did tell me
to dig, right? So I dug.

33:26.410 --> 33:29.400
And, granted, I'm not supposed to have
direct contact with the public

33:29.435 --> 33:31.600
or purport myself as an FBI agent.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.755
And... Ok, I'm definitely

33:33.790 --> 33:35.370
not supposed to accuse
someone of a felony

33:35.405 --> 33:36.475
or even a misdemeanor,

33:36.510 --> 33:38.590
Especially when I don't have
any actual evidence.

33:39.270 --> 33:40.420
Oh, god.

33:40.850 --> 33:42.265
I did just what they did.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.215
I... I based everything on a rumor.

33:44.250 --> 33:46.210
I got sucked right in.
I didn't mean to. I...

33:46.245 --> 33:48.580
Garcia, come on, baby. Stick to Tommy.

33:49.320 --> 33:49.920
Right.

33:50.230 --> 33:51.000
Sorry.

33:51.650 --> 33:52.590
Ok, uh...

33:53.030 --> 33:54.825
He was released from juvie when he was 16.

33:54.860 --> 33:56.765
You couldn't find him?
That's when the trail goes cold.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.070
No, I said the trail went cold,
I didn't say it disappeared.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.760
This is the part I'm actually good at.

34:01.030 --> 34:02.760
Whatever he did in the
interim remains a mystery,

34:02.795 --> 34:05.292
much to my chagrin,
but at the age of 21,

34:05.327 --> 34:07.790
Thomas Boren re-emerged
in Franklin, Indiana.

34:07.825 --> 34:09.485
That's 300 miles away from Royal.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.949
Said Mr. Boren purchased copious
amounts of gasoline

34:11.985 --> 34:14.657
2 months ago. It's not unusual
to do in Indiana,

34:14.692 --> 34:17.330
but Mr. Tommy Wheeler/Boren
didn't own a farm.

34:17.364 --> 34:18.355
The nuisance fires.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.840
Roger that. And then after his
little spending spree,

34:20.875 --> 34:23.290
that's when the trail goes cold
and I can't find him.

34:24.500 --> 34:25.699
Yeah, Hotch.

34:27.370 --> 34:28.360
All right.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.480
There's still no sign of Tina.

34:31.389 --> 34:32.770
He wants you to bring Rawlings.

34:37.699 --> 34:38.989
We've locked down the town

34:39.025 --> 34:40.280
and put out a statewide alert.

34:40.315 --> 34:41.685
So far, nothing.

34:41.719 --> 34:43.719
Where in Royal would Tommy take his sister?

34:44.179 --> 34:44.989
It's hard to say.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.449
It's likely to be a place that's important
to the both of them.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.400
Maybe a place that they went
to together as kids.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.130
I don't know. The only place I can think of

34:51.165 --> 34:53.047
is their grandparents' old house,

34:53.081 --> 34:54.929
but that was torn down years ago.

34:54.965 --> 34:56.045
That's not gonna help us.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.670
I've got pictures of her with the
grandparents and friends.

34:58.705 --> 34:59.707
Nothing with Tommy.

34:59.742 --> 35:00.710
Garcia was right.

35:00.970 --> 35:04.120
After he was sent away,
Tommy no longer existed,

35:04.430 --> 35:05.925
not even as a memory.

35:05.960 --> 35:09.220
Tommy, please, what are we doing here?

35:30.270 --> 35:31.730
I found Tommy.

35:32.250 --> 35:33.800
Or what she had left of him.

35:37.950 --> 35:39.460
You mean everything to me.

35:39.900 --> 35:40.885
Everything.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.590
You and I, we're... We're soul mates.

35:43.625 --> 35:44.515
Tommy.

35:44.550 --> 35:45.940
They can't keep us apart anymore.

35:45.975 --> 35:47.030
That's your sister!

35:47.510 --> 35:48.300
They?

35:51.860 --> 35:53.390
Get off of her right now.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.200
My god, Tommy.

35:58.130 --> 35:59.990
All those... people...

36:00.025 --> 36:01.000
You killed them?

36:02.845 --> 36:02.845
For you. For us.
So we can be together.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.080
Don't you see that...
That's how it was meant to be.

36:05.420 --> 36:06.760
Just the two of us.

36:07.140 --> 36:08.045
You killed Jason?

36:08.080 --> 36:09.810
Don't say his name! Don't!

36:16.850 --> 36:18.460
Hotch, I think we have something here.

36:18.495 --> 36:19.790
What dance is this?

36:21.260 --> 36:22.855
The, uh, spring formal.

36:22.890 --> 36:24.980
They hold it every year
at the community center.

36:25.015 --> 36:27.070
May of '98. This was just before
Tommy was beaten

36:27.105 --> 36:28.500
and forced out of town.

36:29.990 --> 36:32.860
Is this dance something Tommy
and Tina would have gone to?

36:32.895 --> 36:34.245
It's a big event.

36:34.280 --> 36:36.790
All the kids go even if they don't
have formal dates.

36:36.825 --> 36:37.960
So they could have gone together?

36:37.995 --> 36:39.240
Absolutely.

36:46.250 --> 36:47.780
I need you to remember.

36:54.470 --> 36:56.620
Tommy, don't. Don't do this.

36:57.430 --> 36:58.740
We were together.

36:59.440 --> 36:59.945
We were happy.

36:59.980 --> 37:02.650
Tommy, stop it! Please stop it!

37:03.280 --> 37:04.660
You have to turn yourself in.

37:04.695 --> 37:05.800
Remember!

37:09.180 --> 37:10.800
I remember.

37:12.610 --> 37:14.010
It can be like this again.

37:14.590 --> 37:16.510
We can be together, ok? Just like this.

37:16.545 --> 37:18.635
No. We can't, Tommy.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.500
We can't! It isn't right!

37:20.535 --> 37:21.440
It is!

37:25.660 --> 37:27.920
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right. I promise.

37:27.955 --> 37:28.755
You belong with me.

37:28.790 --> 37:31.010
No, I don't! No, I don't!

37:31.045 --> 37:32.137
Please! Let me go!

37:32.172 --> 37:33.230
Tommy, let her go!

37:33.740 --> 37:35.800
Let her go, son!

37:36.030 --> 37:37.070
Let her go!

37:37.530 --> 37:38.280
No.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.845
I'll burn the whole town down.

37:49.880 --> 37:52.590
No, you won't. Not if you love her.

37:57.990 --> 37:59.710
Look at her, Tommy. Look at her.

38:05.460 --> 38:07.770
If you really love her, then let her go.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.145
Please, Tommy.

38:13.180 --> 38:14.610
You don't want to hurt her, son.

38:31.310 --> 38:32.450
I... love you.

38:32.485 --> 38:33.720
I know.

38:50.360 --> 38:53.030
"I have loved to the point of madness.

38:53.065 --> 38:54.960
"That which is called madness.

38:55.440 --> 38:58.370
That which to me is the
only sensible way to love. "

38:59.020 --> 39:00.550
Francoise Sagan.

39:11.690 --> 39:13.310
You guys choose this...

39:14.020 --> 39:15.465
Turning people over like rocks

39:15.500 --> 39:18.070
And looking at all their creepy
crawly things underneath.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.085
And I get it. I do.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.520
It's the only way to catch them. But...

39:21.920 --> 39:23.840
I want to see the good in people.

39:24.270 --> 39:26.370
I choose to see the good in people.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.435
And... getting into someone's mind

39:28.470 --> 39:29.940
and trying to find the god-awful thing
that happened to them

39:29.975 --> 39:32.480
that made them do the god-awful thing
to somebody else

39:32.515 --> 39:35.725
has seriously impaired
my ability to giggle,

39:35.760 --> 39:38.240
And it makes my brain all wonky,
and I don't like it.

39:40.760 --> 39:41.645
Garcia.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.530
Yes, sir.

39:45.510 --> 39:47.075
I just wanted to thank you

39:47.110 --> 39:48.775
for your excellent work on this case.

39:48.810 --> 39:50.440
And I understand that what you did

39:50.475 --> 39:52.490
was for you very difficult.

39:52.900 --> 39:55.570
But your contributions are essential

39:55.605 --> 39:57.060
to the success of this team.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.195
Thank you, sir.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.340
I know you see the good in people, Penelope.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.640
Always.

40:03.990 --> 40:06.390
And I would never want you to change that.
