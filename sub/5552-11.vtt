00:04.993 --> 00:06.431

00:06.432 --> 00:08.383
Gotham will be redeemed
in blood.

00:08.896 --> 00:10.335
By killing nine random people?

00:10.432 --> 00:11.871
You're insane.

00:11.873 --> 00:14.527
And not all the victims
are random.

00:14.528 --> 00:16.030
The Son of Gotham.

00:16.032 --> 00:19.134
I'm going to make sure
that you are telling the truth.

00:19.137 --> 00:21.823
Touch me and my uncle
will have you gutted.

00:21.825 --> 00:23.231
Are we good?!

00:23.233 --> 00:24.927
Yes.

00:24.928 --> 00:26.206
Bruce.

00:26.209 --> 00:27.455
I never bought your stupid act.

00:27.456 --> 00:28.830
You pretended to be my friend.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.367
Good-bye, Silver.

00:32.256 --> 00:33.534
(grunts)

00:34.593 --> 00:35.519
Kill him.

00:36.448 --> 00:38.143
(gunshots)

00:39.008 --> 00:40.511
Where's Galavan?!

00:40.513 --> 00:41.886
What do you want?

00:42.689 --> 00:45.726
Why, your life,

00:45.728 --> 00:47.391
of course.

00:53.472 --> 00:55.582
(machine engines humming)

00:58.593 --> 01:00.511
(grunts)

01:10.336 --> 01:12.447
(machine engines humming)

01:27.553 --> 01:28.767
(door closes)
Hey, guys.

01:28.769 --> 01:30.623
I fixed the hard drive.

01:31.456 --> 01:32.990
(calling out):
Bruce?

01:32.992 --> 01:35.070
Alfred?

01:46.208 --> 01:48.286
(Bruce crying out, panting)

01:56.001 --> 01:57.630
You okay?

01:58.433 --> 01:59.967
Glass of water?

01:59.968 --> 02:01.950
I won't sign those papers,
no matter what you do.

02:01.952 --> 02:03.774
I'm resigned to that.

02:03.777 --> 02:05.759
You're a very brave boy.

02:05.761 --> 02:08.702
I'll just have to acquire
your company by other means.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.799
My true name is Dumas.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.326
And a long time ago,

02:15.328 --> 02:19.006
my family were dishonored
and degraded

02:19.008 --> 02:20.863
by yours.

02:20.865 --> 02:23.487
I'm sorry about that, but...

02:23.489 --> 02:24.862
For centuries our noble clan

02:24.864 --> 02:28.158
lived in vile, squalid
obscurity.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.014
But we lived in hope.

02:30.016 --> 02:32.319
Because our patron saint

02:32.320 --> 02:34.750
spoke of a glorious day
to come.

02:34.753 --> 02:36.479
But that day would only come

02:36.481 --> 02:38.271
when nine men of Gotham

02:38.272 --> 02:40.574
and the last son
of our mortal enemy

02:40.576 --> 02:43.870
are slain by righteous hands.

02:45.696 --> 02:48.158
That's you, Bruce.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.327
You're the last son.

03:04.513 --> 03:06.463
Stop that.

03:06.464 --> 03:09.278
Be glad, boy.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.294
You're the anointed redeemer

03:11.296 --> 03:12.766
of your family.

03:12.768 --> 03:13.694
For seven generations,

03:13.696 --> 03:16.830
the Wayne family
has wallowed in vice

03:16.832 --> 03:18.622
and corruption.

03:18.624 --> 03:23.230
So tonight, at the forewarned
hour of midnight,

03:23.232 --> 03:26.334
the Dumas will be avenged,

03:26.336 --> 03:29.342
and the sins
of the Wayne family

03:29.344 --> 03:33.342
shall wash away in your blood.

04:52.928 --> 04:54.398
He's a friend.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.806
A friend?

04:55.808 --> 04:57.406
You're welcome, by the way.

No thanks needed,

05:14.881 --> 05:17.054
Yeah, he is.

05:17.056 --> 05:19.550
Oh, you're free to go,

05:19.552 --> 05:21.502
of course, Jim.

05:21.504 --> 05:23.934
Desperate fugitive
from the law, though you be.

05:23.936 --> 05:25.375
But I beg of you,

05:25.376 --> 05:27.358
sit and consider.

05:29.088 --> 05:32.447
You and I share a bond
in Theo Galavan.

05:32.448 --> 05:35.358
A passion, if you will.

05:36.896 --> 05:39.774
If there was ever a time
for us to work together,

05:39.776 --> 05:42.334
now is that time.

05:48.512 --> 05:50.430
(footfalls approaching)

05:52.673 --> 05:55.487
Yes, brother,
it's all yours.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.246
For God's sakes,
smile.

05:57.248 --> 05:59.614
Did you find the manservant?

05:59.616 --> 06:01.278
Nope.
(liquid pouring)

06:02.080 --> 06:03.935
You lost him?

06:03.936 --> 06:06.142
What can one old butler do?

06:06.144 --> 06:07.518
That's not the point.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.109
The point is your
lackadaisical attitude.

06:10.112 --> 06:12.030
We're building
an empire here.

06:12.032 --> 06:15.134
Getting nervous, are we?

06:15.136 --> 06:17.662
Your childishness
is no longer funny.

06:17.664 --> 06:19.710
You need to grow up.
Oh, please.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.015
Pull the stick out, big shot.

06:22.016 --> 06:24.830
Like I don't know you
from<i> way</i> back.

06:24.832 --> 06:26.590
Don't.

06:26.592 --> 06:29.118
Without all of this wealth
and power, what are you?

06:29.120 --> 06:32.798
A sad little...

06:32.800 --> 06:34.430
(quietly):
I said don't.

06:35.392 --> 06:37.886
Uncle Theo?

06:40.064 --> 06:41.566
Yes, my dear.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.774
What is it?

06:43.776 --> 06:45.823
I'm fighting off a cold.

06:46.816 --> 06:48.286
I was thinking

06:48.288 --> 06:51.710
I'd go to bed early tonight,
if it's okay to miss out on...

06:51.712 --> 06:54.111
the ceremony?

06:54.880 --> 06:56.510
A cold?

06:56.512 --> 06:59.198
Really?

06:59.200 --> 07:01.534
I'm beginning
to wonder,

07:01.536 --> 07:04.990
Silver, if you're cut out
for the task ahead of us.

07:06.944 --> 07:08.254
I am.

07:08.256 --> 07:10.046
Bruce Wayne bested you,

07:10.048 --> 07:11.710
and yet you still feel for him.

07:11.712 --> 07:13.151
He should be nothing to you.

07:13.152 --> 07:14.429
He is.

07:14.432 --> 07:15.902
He's nothing to me.

07:15.904 --> 07:17.790
But you can't watch him die,

07:17.792 --> 07:19.230
can you?

07:19.232 --> 07:20.639
You're soft, Silver.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.175
You have compassion.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.094
No.

07:25.152 --> 07:27.422
No?

07:27.424 --> 07:29.279
Let's see, shall we?

07:31.072 --> 07:32.798
Hmm.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.926
I'm going to give you a test.

07:37.921 --> 07:39.775
Anything.

07:39.776 --> 07:42.846
Make Bruce Wayne fall
in love with you

07:42.848 --> 07:44.222
all over again.

07:44.224 --> 07:46.558
I want to see him kiss you
before he dies.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.933
But he knows.

07:47.936 --> 07:49.694
He knows what
I am now.

07:49.696 --> 07:51.230
He hates me.

07:51.232 --> 07:54.206
(laughs):
Well, that's what
makes it a test.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.630
If you're guileful enough
to win back his heart

07:57.632 --> 08:00.830
and cruel enough to smile
at his killing,

08:00.832 --> 08:03.198
then I'll know you're worthy
of the family name.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.406
Brother, seriously?

08:06.208 --> 08:07.806
Cut the poor kid some slack.

08:07.808 --> 08:09.342
More from you?

08:09.344 --> 08:10.238
Really?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.902
Isn't there some other way?

08:11.904 --> 08:14.046
Oh, my dear,

08:14.048 --> 08:15.903
I like you very much,

08:15.904 --> 08:17.694
but family interests
come first,

08:17.696 --> 08:20.062
and there are other girls
of the Dumas blood

08:20.064 --> 08:21.438
I could turn to,

08:21.440 --> 08:24.095
should you fail
to prove your mettle.

08:24.096 --> 08:25.694
Understand?

08:26.688 --> 08:28.991
Do you?

08:28.992 --> 08:30.430
My charming brother here

08:30.432 --> 08:32.542
will throw you
out on the street,

08:32.544 --> 08:35.070
if he's kind enough
not to kill you.

08:35.072 --> 08:37.535
Well, let's not dwell
on the negative, hmm?

08:37.536 --> 08:39.102
You can do it.

08:39.104 --> 08:40.350
I know you can.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.102
Be resourceful,
be ruthless.

08:44.864 --> 08:47.870
Why don't you get yourself
something pretty to put on.

09:08.704 --> 09:10.814
(clattering, latch clicks)

09:19.168 --> 09:21.598
(door closes, latch clicks)

09:27.488 --> 09:30.558
(softly):
Hey.

09:31.328 --> 09:33.598
Why are you here?

09:34.400 --> 09:38.142
I wanted to say...

09:38.144 --> 09:40.543
I'm really,

09:40.544 --> 09:43.550
really sorry
for what's happened.

09:47.072 --> 09:49.342
And I'm sorry
that I had to lie to you.

09:50.144 --> 09:53.630
I had to do
what my uncle said.

09:55.200 --> 10:00.157
But I think
you're a good person,

10:00.160 --> 10:04.350
and if I could help you,
I would.

10:04.352 --> 10:08.766
But I can't,
and I'm sorry.

10:08.768 --> 10:11.262
And I thought maybe
you would like some company.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.542
But if you don't, that's fine,

10:16.544 --> 10:19.006
I'll go.

10:19.008 --> 10:21.342
Yes.

10:21.344 --> 10:23.006
Please go.

10:25.152 --> 10:26.814
(sighs softly)

10:26.816 --> 10:29.566
You really hate me?

10:29.568 --> 10:32.862
I have no feelings for you
whatsoever.

10:32.864 --> 10:34.942
Well, I like you.

10:34.944 --> 10:37.694
And I'm sorry.

10:37.695 --> 10:39.933
That's all.

10:43.648 --> 10:45.918
You can stay if you like.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.822
(gasps, groans)

11:05.824 --> 11:07.070
(car horn honking)
Excuse me.

11:07.072 --> 11:08.766
Stop, stop, stop!

11:10.720 --> 11:12.894
Stop, sir! Stop, sir!
Stop, stop, stop!

11:12.896 --> 11:14.206
Excuse me, sir.

11:14.208 --> 11:15.518
Oh, what, are you crazy
or something?

11:15.520 --> 11:16.286
Stop!

11:16.288 --> 11:17.246
Hey, come on!

11:17.248 --> 11:19.390
Come on, I got to get to work!

11:19.392 --> 11:20.894
I am most terribly sorry, sir.

11:20.895 --> 11:22.781
I'm in the most frightful hurry.

11:22.784 --> 11:23.902
OFFICER:
Freeze!

11:23.904 --> 11:24.990
Oh, Officers...

11:24.991 --> 11:26.398
(electrical crackling)

11:29.312 --> 11:31.326
Captain, what the hell?

11:31.328 --> 11:32.670
You put out a warrant on Jim?

11:32.671 --> 11:34.397
"Armed and
dangerous"?

11:34.400 --> 11:35.358
That's right.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.438
He's not a criminal.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.134
He was obviously
abducted

11:39.135 --> 11:40.509
or-or-or something.

11:40.512 --> 11:41.662
Look, I hope you're right,

11:41.663 --> 11:43.837
but the facts on the ground
don't look that way.

11:43.839 --> 11:44.893
He assaulted the mayor

11:44.895 --> 11:45.982
and escaped
GCPD custody

11:45.984 --> 11:47.486
with Penguin.

11:47.488 --> 11:49.630
Two good cops died
and now he's a fugitive.

11:49.632 --> 11:51.806
What would you call that,
if not criminal?
Well...

11:51.808 --> 11:53.118
Galavan was obviously...

11:53.120 --> 11:54.686
Galavan is innocent
until proven otherwise.

11:54.688 --> 11:56.573
If Jim isn't dirty,

11:56.576 --> 11:57.854
I need to hear that from him.

11:57.856 --> 11:59.902
Where is he?
Do you know where he is?

11:59.903 --> 12:01.213
No.

12:01.215 --> 12:03.293
Do you know how long
he's been working with Penguin?

12:03.296 --> 12:04.926
He's not working with Penguin.

12:04.928 --> 12:06.270
And he's not dirty,

12:06.271 --> 12:07.933
and I resent
being questioned like this.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.853
Oh, stop it.
You're his girlfriend.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.485
You know I have to ask you
these questions.

12:11.488 --> 12:13.150
I'm gonna ask you again
if you know where he is,

12:13.152 --> 12:15.998
because if you do,
and you don't tell me,

12:16.000 --> 12:17.950
that makes you an accomplice
after the fact.

12:17.952 --> 12:19.870
I don't know where he is.

12:19.872 --> 12:22.079
I don't like this
any more than you do.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.549
Jim is like a son to me.

12:23.551 --> 12:27.133
A father would have
shown more faith.

12:27.135 --> 12:28.798
Are you sure you know Jim

12:28.800 --> 12:30.590
as well as
you think you do?

12:35.935 --> 12:37.597
Is your lover-man alive?

12:37.599 --> 12:40.062
Go to Grundy. 805.

12:43.455 --> 12:45.597
(ticking)

12:46.912 --> 12:48.862
SILVER:
Will you please
talk to me?

12:48.863 --> 12:50.749
Silence makes me sad.

12:53.088 --> 12:54.590
Talk about what?

12:56.640 --> 12:59.262
It doesn't matter.

12:59.264 --> 13:00.926
Anything.

13:02.655 --> 13:03.613
Top ten lists...

13:03.615 --> 13:06.749
best vacations.

13:06.751 --> 13:08.765
What's your favorite animal?

13:08.767 --> 13:10.685
Owls.

13:10.687 --> 13:11.805
Owls.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.294
Owls, okay.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.077
Owls are cool.

13:20.224 --> 13:21.918
Did you ever swim
with a dolphin?

13:22.719 --> 13:24.381
No.

13:24.383 --> 13:26.301
I did, once.

13:26.303 --> 13:28.606
Oh, my gosh.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.046
It was magical.

13:30.047 --> 13:33.245
It was...
like we were friends, like...

13:33.248 --> 13:35.550
They have
this power.

13:35.551 --> 13:38.206
They can, like,
read your mind.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.870
No, they can't.

13:39.872 --> 13:42.814
No, they<i> can.</i>

13:42.816 --> 13:44.958
They can see your brain waves.

13:47.104 --> 13:48.926
They have a form of sonar,

13:48.928 --> 13:52.062
so they can see inside you
and detect tumors,

13:52.064 --> 13:54.045
that sort
of thing.

13:54.047 --> 13:56.029
But they can't read minds.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.478
Well, the one I met
could read my mind.

14:04.128 --> 14:07.550
(boat horn blows)

14:17.056 --> 14:18.974
(guns cocking)

14:26.720 --> 14:27.966
Lee.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.470
What the hell
are you doing?

14:29.471 --> 14:30.781
I need to get you
out of town.

14:30.783 --> 14:33.182
Penguin has a reliable man
who can take you upstate.

14:34.432 --> 14:35.934
Things are gonna be
unsettled here for a while.

14:35.935 --> 14:36.926
Unsettled?

14:36.928 --> 14:39.070
We're gonna take
down Galavan.

14:39.071 --> 14:40.637
Are you out of your mind?

14:40.639 --> 14:43.229
Ms. Thompkins,
I can assure you...

14:43.232 --> 14:44.862
He has to be stopped, Lee.

14:44.864 --> 14:45.918
By you?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.358
And... these people?

14:47.359 --> 14:48.381
He has to be stopped.

14:48.384 --> 14:51.230
You keep trying
to kill yourself.

14:51.232 --> 14:52.542
Have I got you all wrong?

14:52.544 --> 14:54.013
Are you just crazy?
Of course not.

14:54.015 --> 14:55.422
You're on the run from the law.

14:55.424 --> 14:57.086
You want to attack the mayor

14:57.088 --> 14:59.069
with the help
of a depraved sociopath.

14:59.071 --> 15:00.253
That's not crazy?

15:00.256 --> 15:01.022
I can hear you.

15:01.024 --> 15:02.078
Shh! Don't speak.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.510
Jim, don't do this.

15:04.512 --> 15:05.950
Let's get out of town together.

15:05.951 --> 15:07.773
I don't care
what you've done already

15:07.775 --> 15:09.533
or what you have
to leave undone. Let's just go.

15:09.535 --> 15:11.038
I can't.
Jim, please.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.662
I can't. I can't let Galavan
win this way.

15:14.431 --> 15:16.126
I'm pregnant.

15:16.928 --> 15:18.942
(Oswald gasps)

15:18.943 --> 15:20.701
(sighs)

15:24.608 --> 15:27.038
There were
silver-white roses

15:27.040 --> 15:29.662
and red lilies
all over the house.

15:29.664 --> 15:31.774
All of my friends
were there.

15:33.087 --> 15:35.486
There was music
and dancing.

15:37.088 --> 15:38.558
And my mom
made me a cake

15:38.560 --> 15:40.094
with my name
spelled out in chocolate.

15:40.095 --> 15:43.037
That was the year
before she died.

15:45.823 --> 15:47.933
She looked so beautiful.

15:47.935 --> 15:49.374
And happy.

15:49.376 --> 15:51.294
So, yeah...

15:52.608 --> 15:55.710
...that's my favorite memory.

15:55.711 --> 15:57.566
My ninth birthday.

16:02.847 --> 16:04.286
How about you?

16:08.736 --> 16:09.853
I don't know.

16:09.855 --> 16:11.454
Come on.

16:11.456 --> 16:13.022
You must have one.

16:14.688 --> 16:16.606
So your parents
really are dead, are they?

16:20.960 --> 16:22.110
Yeah.

16:25.183 --> 16:27.838
I wasn't lying about that.

16:30.079 --> 16:31.549
I'm sorry.

16:31.551 --> 16:34.237
Hey...

16:34.240 --> 16:36.350
that's show business.

16:47.871 --> 16:49.981
We went camping once,
in a forest.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.046
My father and I

16:54.048 --> 16:56.222
climbed an oak tree
and ate oranges.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.502
We could hear my mom
singing to herself

17:01.503 --> 17:03.069
as she built the fire.

17:07.296 --> 17:09.533
That was a good day.

17:14.016 --> 17:16.478
Damn it...

17:16.480 --> 17:19.166
Damn it. I can't do this.

17:21.024 --> 17:22.302
I can't let you die.

17:22.304 --> 17:25.118
That's good of you to say so,
but is it up to you?

17:25.120 --> 17:27.422
If we can get out of the cell
and past the guard,

17:27.423 --> 17:30.141
I know a back stairwell
that isn't watched.

17:30.143 --> 17:31.421
That's a big if.

17:31.423 --> 17:32.829
What are you going to do?

17:34.464 --> 17:36.254
I<i> am</i> a Dumas.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.366
I have some pull around here.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.694
Open up.

17:41.696 --> 17:44.158
(lock clicks)

17:45.600 --> 17:46.846
Come in.

17:48.607 --> 17:50.269
Give me your gun.

17:52.479 --> 17:53.726
(screams)

17:55.519 --> 17:56.765
(guard groaning)

18:02.335 --> 18:04.317
(panting)

18:05.760 --> 18:06.718
Come on!

18:15.487 --> 18:17.757
(Silver screams)

18:21.535 --> 18:23.773
Oh, you silly girl.

18:24.544 --> 18:26.590
What were you thinking?

18:35.775 --> 18:37.790
(crying quietly)

18:39.967 --> 18:41.918
LUCIUS:
<i> Bruce and Alfred</i>

18:41.920 --> 18:43.262
have been gone
for at least 12 hours.

18:43.263 --> 18:44.413
I'm afraid
they've been abducted.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.589
We're very busy now, Mr. Fox.

18:46.591 --> 18:48.509
12 hours
isn't very long.

18:48.511 --> 18:50.462
I am sure that
something has happened.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.382
We usually don't post
missing persons

18:52.384 --> 18:54.238
until they've been
missing for 24 hours,

18:54.239 --> 18:57.917
but out of respect
for Wayne Enterprises...

18:57.919 --> 18:59.741
(line ringing)

18:59.743 --> 19:01.534
Bruce Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth.

19:01.536 --> 19:03.421
Run them through the system.

19:03.423 --> 19:04.829
Thank you.

19:04.831 --> 19:06.493
Was there any evidence
of an abduction?

19:06.495 --> 19:08.254
There was a lamp stand
knocked over

19:08.256 --> 19:09.438
and there was a window opened.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.069
Uh-huh.

19:11.071 --> 19:12.637
Who do you think abducted them?

19:12.639 --> 19:15.005
Well, Theo Galavan
is the obvious suspect.

19:15.007 --> 19:16.189
Do you have any proof of that?

19:16.192 --> 19:18.206
Uh... threats made,

19:18.208 --> 19:19.646
physical
evidence?
No.

19:19.647 --> 19:20.925
But it's obvious.

19:20.928 --> 19:22.366
He's trying to take
over the company.

19:22.367 --> 19:23.901
Captain, we know
the man's dirty.

19:23.903 --> 19:25.053
Of course we know he's dirty.

19:25.055 --> 19:26.973
We know the names
of every dirty crook in Gotham.

19:26.975 --> 19:28.766
So what?

19:28.768 --> 19:30.814
Proof, Bullock!
Proof!

19:30.815 --> 19:32.189
To get a warrant
against Galavan,

19:32.191 --> 19:33.245
we need proof of a crime

19:33.247 --> 19:34.333
and proof that he's involved.

19:34.335 --> 19:35.742
(phone ringing)

19:35.744 --> 19:37.534
Speak.

19:40.703 --> 19:41.661
Huh.

19:43.872 --> 19:45.982
(sputtering)

19:48.735 --> 19:50.942
Where's Master Bruce?

19:50.944 --> 19:53.342
We were hoping you knew.

19:53.343 --> 19:56.125
I was in the process of
commandeering a vehicle

19:56.127 --> 19:58.717
when two of your...
idiotic cozzers shot me

19:58.719 --> 20:00.733
straight in the bloody
face with a stun gun.

20:00.735 --> 20:01.645
Here I am.

20:01.646 --> 20:02.556
And there's your
warrant, Captain.

20:02.559 --> 20:04.477
Where?
He was assaulted

20:04.479 --> 20:05.565
on Galavan's
property

20:05.567 --> 20:06.814
by known associates
of Galavan.

20:06.816 --> 20:09.053
While trespassing
in Galavan's Tower.

20:09.055 --> 20:11.773
He was lawfully pursued
off the property

20:11.775 --> 20:12.862
by the rightful
occupants.

20:12.863 --> 20:13.885
You got nothing there.

20:13.888 --> 20:15.613
Galavan's got Bruce Wayne, boss,

20:15.615 --> 20:16.829
sure as eggs.

20:16.831 --> 20:18.942
Give me real proof.

20:18.944 --> 20:20.702
We already jumped the gun once
with Galavan

20:20.704 --> 20:22.366
and we got screwed.

20:22.367 --> 20:24.285
Without solid proof,
no judge is gonna sign

20:24.287 --> 20:26.237
a warrant... eggs or no eggs.

20:26.239 --> 20:28.030
So what do you propose we do?

20:28.032 --> 20:28.990
You hang tight.

20:28.992 --> 20:30.718
We'll dig up some...

20:30.720 --> 20:31.614
health and safety issue.

20:31.615 --> 20:34.109
Get a backdoor warrant
for Galavan Tower.

20:34.111 --> 20:35.454
ALFRED:
Right, how long's
that gonna take, then?

20:35.455 --> 20:36.861
BARNES:
Probably till
tomorrow morning.

20:36.863 --> 20:38.973
But...
That's the best
we can do.

20:40.064 --> 20:40.829
Oh, uh...

20:40.831 --> 20:42.301
you're free to go.

20:42.303 --> 20:43.709
We'll drop your charges.

20:43.711 --> 20:45.662
Right, well, you know, thank you

20:45.663 --> 20:47.805
very much indeed.

20:47.807 --> 20:49.341
Look, Bullock,
I'm gonna need some

20:49.343 --> 20:51.165
clean bandages, I'm gonna need

20:51.167 --> 20:52.349
a car...

20:52.351 --> 20:54.462
and a couple of guns.

20:54.464 --> 20:55.262
You got it.

20:55.263 --> 20:56.445
What are you going to do?

20:56.447 --> 20:58.813
I've got no choice. No time.

20:58.815 --> 21:00.445
I've got to go visit him.

21:00.447 --> 21:02.205
I'll come with you.
LUCIUS:
Are two men enough?

21:02.207 --> 21:04.766
It wouldn't seem so, but
violence is not my métier.

21:04.768 --> 21:06.814
No. Two men are not enough.

21:06.815 --> 21:09.789
I would gladly join you, but I
imagine an amateur is no asset.

21:09.791 --> 21:12.253
A hindrance, perhaps.
That's very true.

21:12.255 --> 21:13.662
We need Jim Gordon.

21:13.664 --> 21:15.198
He's perfect
for this kind of thing.

21:15.199 --> 21:17.117
Where is he?
Yeah, where is Jim Gordon?

21:17.119 --> 21:19.133
It's a long story,
but nobody knows.

21:19.135 --> 21:20.765
(chuckles)

21:20.767 --> 21:22.237
Something funny, Ed?

21:22.239 --> 21:23.709
Do you know
where Gordon is?

21:23.711 --> 21:25.948
Do you?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.294
Start speaking,
Windows.

21:27.295 --> 21:30.109
Um, uh... A diamond plate,

21:30.111 --> 21:32.477
a glowing grate, a place
you never leave. Where am I?

21:32.479 --> 21:34.782
What?

21:34.784 --> 21:35.422
Home.

21:35.423 --> 21:37.245
Whose home? Your home?

21:37.247 --> 21:38.749
Gordon's at your home?

21:38.751 --> 21:41.405
N... No. Yes.

21:42.783 --> 21:45.309
Who are you?

21:48.031 --> 21:50.430
Good luck, old friend.

21:50.431 --> 21:51.549
See you around.

21:51.551 --> 21:53.117
I hope not.

21:53.119 --> 21:54.429
Good-bye, Penguin.

21:54.431 --> 21:57.628
Good-bye, Ms. Thompkins.

21:57.631 --> 21:59.549
Please don't think too badly
of me.

21:59.551 --> 22:01.662
We are what we are.

22:01.664 --> 22:03.582
(chuckles)

22:03.584 --> 22:05.022
That's true.

22:05.023 --> 22:07.070
Good-bye,
Mr. Cobblepot.

22:09.727 --> 22:11.837
(siren wailing in distance)

22:20.383 --> 22:22.589
(tires screeching)

22:24.287 --> 22:26.877
GORDON:
Huh.

22:26.880 --> 22:29.213
Let's go.
Yeah.

22:33.983 --> 22:36.349
Wait here.

22:54.015 --> 22:56.126
Galavan has Bruce.

22:56.127 --> 22:57.981
I understand.

22:57.983 --> 23:01.437
Just promise
me...

23:01.440 --> 23:03.613
What?

23:03.615 --> 23:05.470
Never mind.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.517
Do what you think is best.

23:08.671 --> 23:10.653
Call me when it's over.

23:25.823 --> 23:27.741
(crying)

23:32.160 --> 23:35.230
I must look terrible.

23:36.767 --> 23:40.061
No. You don't.

23:42.399 --> 23:44.317
Thank you.

23:47.071 --> 23:49.757
You're so calm.

23:49.759 --> 23:52.125
It's like you're not scared.

23:52.127 --> 23:54.590
I guess I'm not.

23:54.591 --> 23:56.861
It's weird.

23:56.863 --> 24:00.573
You... are weird.

24:00.575 --> 24:02.557
But I love you.

24:04.479 --> 24:06.173
Do you?

24:06.175 --> 24:08.093
I do.

24:09.663 --> 24:11.773
Do you love me?

24:13.119 --> 24:15.037
No.

24:19.007 --> 24:21.373
No?

24:21.375 --> 24:23.293
Silver, I don't know
why you're doing it,

24:23.295 --> 24:26.493
but I know
you're playing with me.

24:26.495 --> 24:28.925
I know that whole escape
was a ghoulish charade.

24:28.927 --> 24:30.653
That's a horrible lie.

24:30.655 --> 24:33.725
I'm only telling you this
because, when I'm dead,

24:33.727 --> 24:35.197
you may feel bad,

24:35.199 --> 24:37.437
and I don't want you to think
you tricked me.

24:39.711 --> 24:41.917
Silver, I don't love you.

24:43.903 --> 24:45.884
I pity you.

24:45.887 --> 24:47.998
(exhales)

24:53.023 --> 24:56.093
Why do you do this?

24:56.863 --> 24:59.165
What's the point?

25:01.087 --> 25:04.350
Uncle Theo made me.

25:05.631 --> 25:08.509
He said if I can't make you
love me again,

25:08.511 --> 25:10.684
if you don't kiss
me good-bye,

25:10.687 --> 25:14.046
then I'm not good
enough for the family.

25:14.847 --> 25:18.429
He's going to kick me out.

25:18.431 --> 25:21.309
Or kill me.

25:21.311 --> 25:25.117
Same thing, really.

25:28.959 --> 25:30.333
I see.

25:30.335 --> 25:32.412
God, I'm such a loser.

25:32.415 --> 25:34.845
An evil, pathetic loser.

25:34.847 --> 25:36.253
You're not.

25:37.727 --> 25:39.197
You're young and scared

25:39.199 --> 25:41.758
and under the control
of bad people.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.853
You can change.

25:46.623 --> 25:48.414
There's hope.

25:48.415 --> 25:50.589
You can't even imagine

25:50.591 --> 25:53.277
the things I've done.

25:54.047 --> 25:56.669
There's no hope.

25:56.671 --> 26:00.125
There's no going back
to normal life.

26:00.127 --> 26:03.645
My family is
all I have.

26:03.647 --> 26:07.678
Now I've lost them, too.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.501
All right.

26:13.503 --> 26:14.653
Everybody set? Let's go.

26:14.654 --> 26:16.380
Whoa, whoa.
What's the plan?

26:16.383 --> 26:18.430
We get into that building,
find Galavan,

26:18.431 --> 26:20.029
put a gun in his mouth
until he gives up Bruce.

26:20.031 --> 26:22.269
Then I kill
him slowly.

26:22.271 --> 26:23.613
No. Then we arrest him.

26:23.615 --> 26:26.461
Yeah, no.

26:26.463 --> 26:27.933
Are you nuts?

26:27.935 --> 26:28.893
After all that he has done?

26:28.895 --> 26:30.205
He's going to stand trial.

26:30.207 --> 26:31.901
Gotham needs to know
who he really is.

26:31.903 --> 26:34.173
Gotham needs him dead!
ALFRED:
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.

26:34.175 --> 26:36.989
Can we just stop the bunny and
just first get in there, please,

26:36.991 --> 26:38.398
chaps?
Yes.

26:38.399 --> 26:41.373
Let's go.
LUCIUS: Seriously, that's
it? You have no plan?

26:41.375 --> 26:43.293
How are you even going to get
into the building?

26:43.295 --> 26:46.077
I know a way.

26:48.511 --> 26:49.854
Who is she?

26:49.855 --> 26:50.845
Fox, that's Cat.

26:50.847 --> 26:52.509
Cat,
Fox.

26:52.511 --> 26:53.437
You know a way in?

26:53.439 --> 26:54.397
Yeah.

26:54.399 --> 26:55.581
I know a way in, Gordon.

26:55.582 --> 26:57.533
ALFRED:
How do we know
you haven't stitched us up?

26:57.535 --> 26:58.685
I mean,
you've switched

26:58.687 --> 27:00.221
sides often enough.
How do we know

27:00.223 --> 27:02.013
that you're not
working with Galavan now?

27:02.015 --> 27:03.997
How do I know you're not
a Martian in a rubber suit?

27:03.999 --> 27:06.077
I trust her.

27:06.079 --> 27:07.452
You're in, Cat.

27:07.454 --> 27:09.245
Thanks
for your help.

27:09.247 --> 27:10.078
Grab a vest and let's go.

27:10.079 --> 27:11.548
People,

27:11.550 --> 27:12.252
surely
we should have

27:12.254 --> 27:13.788
a backup
strategy, given

27:13.791 --> 27:15.133
the strong possibilities
of failure.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.477
Au contraire, Mr. Fox.

27:17.567 --> 27:19.101
Failure is not an option!

27:20.190 --> 27:22.012
What he said.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.733
As you like.

27:26.879 --> 27:30.877
Stop acting like
you're not scared.

27:31.839 --> 27:33.533
I know you are.

27:33.535 --> 27:35.965
Sure.

27:35.967 --> 27:40.765
Maybe a little but...

27:40.767 --> 27:44.093
mostly, I feel very alive.

27:46.015 --> 27:47.933
Happy, even.

27:49.663 --> 27:52.509
I'm going to see my parents.

27:52.511 --> 27:55.005
(footfalls approaching)

27:55.007 --> 27:57.501
Hold that thought.

One moment, please.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.758
Good-bye, Silver.

28:29.759 --> 28:32.381

Theo, leave her be.

33:27.838 --> 33:28.828

34:35.038 --> 34:38.012
You want to make a bet?

34:39.103 --> 34:40.605
Whoa.

34:40.607 --> 34:42.653
Maybe you're right.

34:42.654 --> 34:45.340
Steady now, Jim.
I was just talking big,

34:45.342 --> 34:47.644
as they say.

34:47.646 --> 34:48.637
You caught me fair and square.

34:48.639 --> 34:50.333
Had you that way the last time.

34:50.334 --> 34:51.868
You turned it around.

34:51.871 --> 34:54.429
Jim.

34:54.430 --> 34:56.348
Back up.

34:56.350 --> 34:57.820
I got him.

34:57.822 --> 34:59.068
Back up, I said.

35:00.479 --> 35:03.068
And you--
on your knees.

35:03.070 --> 35:05.052
I have a warrant
to search these premises.

35:05.054 --> 35:07.132
Jim,

35:07.135 --> 35:09.853
now, you put your gun on
the ground and put your hands

35:09.854 --> 35:11.068
on top of your head.
What?

35:11.070 --> 35:12.604
You heard me.
You're still a fugitive.

35:12.606 --> 35:14.205
Captain, I've done
nothing wrong.

35:14.207 --> 35:15.613
I want to believe you, Jim.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.276
So we're gonna do this
by the book.

35:17.278 --> 35:19.324
Put your gun on the ground

35:19.326 --> 35:21.533
and let's handle this
the right way.

35:23.007 --> 35:25.117

we are all friends here.

35:36.222 --> 35:37.180

35:37.182 --> 35:38.524
I apologize for that.

35:38.526 --> 35:40.733
But there we are.
Done now.

35:40.735 --> 35:42.364
They're still alive.
That's something.

35:42.366 --> 35:45.373
Look forward now, Jim.
What now?

35:45.374 --> 35:48.348
I will kill you
to get to him if I have to.

35:50.847 --> 35:54.013
Forget that this man
sicced Barbara Kean on you.

35:54.014 --> 35:55.676
Forget that he nearly killed

35:55.678 --> 35:57.980
the mother of your child.

35:57.982 --> 36:01.468
Forget revenge.
Think of the greater good.

36:01.470 --> 36:03.356

36:07.902 --> 36:09.500
Are you 100% sure that

36:09.502 --> 36:11.740
he won't beat this
and walk free again?

36:11.742 --> 36:13.308

Master Bruce,

36:23.294 --> 36:25.020
this falls
very firmly

36:25.022 --> 36:27.069
into the category
of "I told you so".

36:27.071 --> 36:28.829
I told him so, too, Alfred.

36:28.830 --> 36:30.364
Yes, well,
thank you both for your help,

36:30.366 --> 36:32.477

feasible escape plan.
