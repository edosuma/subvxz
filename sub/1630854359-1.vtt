00:35.875 --> 00:37.125
Are you kidding me?

00:37.208 --> 00:39.833
Rust Bank Brewery
is the heart of this town.

00:39.916 --> 00:41.500
No deal, Mr. and Mrs. Klaxon.

00:41.583 --> 00:45.875
-<i> Do you realize who I am?</i>
We are <i>not </i>selling the brewery.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.416
Not to you or anyone else.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.166
<i>Wait, wait!</i>
Got it?

00:49.791 --> 00:51.416
You shut that down, Delroy?

00:51.916 --> 00:53.083
It's over, Wilma.

00:53.166 --> 00:55.625
I told him more beer, less prisons.

00:55.708 --> 00:57.041
Whoo!

00:57.125 --> 00:59.250
-Did real good here too!

00:59.333 --> 01:00.708
I love that!

01:00.791 --> 01:02.875
My library is set for the year.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.958
-Time to go, Kat.
-Okay.

01:08.041 --> 01:10.958
-Before you put Mr. Fawzi out of business.
-Daddy!

01:11.041 --> 01:13.208
-Bye-bye, Kat!

01:20.375 --> 01:21.583
What's that, Kat?

01:22.375 --> 01:24.625
Uh… Uh, dessert!

01:24.708 --> 01:26.166
No, honey, you'll pop.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.833
Delroy, honey, pull over.
I don't like this.

01:38.916 --> 01:40.375
W-We'll be fine, Wilma.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.083
Look, almost home.

01:51.583 --> 01:52.958
-What, baby?

01:53.458 --> 01:54.333
Watch out!

01:56.250 --> 01:57.375
No!

01:58.833 --> 01:59.666
Delroy!

02:00.666 --> 02:01.500
Daddy!

02:02.208 --> 02:04.916
-Kat, you need to swim like we taught you.
-No!

02:05.000 --> 02:07.708
-Mama! Aren't you coming?
-Right behind you, baby!

02:07.791 --> 02:08.958
Mama, I'm scared!

02:09.041 --> 02:10.666
Now, listen to me, baby.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.000
-You need to take a deep breath.

02:15.375 --> 02:16.208
Now, go!

02:32.000 --> 02:35.541
<i>One scream,</i>
<i>and my parents were gone.</i>

02:36.875 --> 02:40.791
<i>Figured I'd just hate myself</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

02:42.625 --> 02:45.500
<i>But… fate had other ideas.</i>

02:48.166 --> 02:50.375
<i>They say everyone's got demons, right?</i>

02:51.875 --> 02:53.875
<i>My demons have names.</i>

02:56.666 --> 02:59.541
Soul Jockeys!
On the double!

03:03.333 --> 03:08.291
Welcome to the scariest place
in the Underworld.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.666
I'm your host, Buffalo Belzer,

03:11.750 --> 03:16.625
and this is the Scream Faire!

03:52.125 --> 03:53.458
Yes!

04:01.083 --> 04:02.208
Shocking!

04:14.166 --> 04:15.375
Ooh, ouch.

04:19.208 --> 04:21.916
Look at you go!

04:38.875 --> 04:40.333
Ah!

04:48.291 --> 04:49.166
Ah!

04:56.875 --> 04:57.875
Okay.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.833
Okay, that's it!
W-W-Wild, you're doin' it again!

05:00.916 --> 05:03.625
-Doing what, Wendell?
-Stealin' the hair cream!

05:03.708 --> 05:05.958
That's just a bad plug right there.
That's what that is.

05:06.041 --> 05:07.791
-Why'd you plant it?
-It's not a bad plug.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.000
You're depriving that plug
of its rightful nutrients.

05:13.958 --> 05:15.083
Need I remind you?

05:15.166 --> 05:19.625
It's your fault
Belzer put us in jail for treason!

05:20.125 --> 05:22.000
And if he goes bald,

05:22.083 --> 05:24.000
he'll skin us both alive!

05:24.083 --> 05:25.125
Both?

05:25.208 --> 05:27.958
I'm not worried, Wendell.
You're the one shootin' blanks.

05:28.041 --> 05:30.625
-Get-- Get-- Hey!
-Oh!

05:30.708 --> 05:34.000
As your older brother,
I demand you regurgitate that cream!

05:34.083 --> 05:37.291
Now, why would I do that? Wendell…

05:38.375 --> 05:41.625
fresh cream ain't gonna
revivify a bad plug.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.458
Did you just admit
you've been stealing it?

05:43.541 --> 05:44.958
-Uh-huh.
-Why?!

05:45.041 --> 05:46.666
'Cause it tickles my tummy.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.458
That's the dumbest thing I've…
What?

05:51.333 --> 05:55.791
I'm gonna kill you!
I'mma throttle you from here to next Tue--

05:57.625 --> 06:00.166
Oh, hey, you right!
That does feel kinda good.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.416
-Yeah, and the best part…
-Oh?

06:02.500 --> 06:05.000
Three, two, one,

06:05.083 --> 06:06.791
and…

06:07.708 --> 06:09.375
Ooh, yeah!

06:09.458 --> 06:11.625
Yeah.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.583
-Whoa.

06:18.916 --> 06:21.208
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

06:21.291 --> 06:24.875
I'm having a-- a vision, Wild!

06:24.958 --> 06:26.833
A green-headed girl.

06:26.916 --> 06:28.291
You see her too?

06:28.375 --> 06:29.208
I do.

06:29.291 --> 06:33.250
She seems so real!

06:33.333 --> 06:34.750
Freaky!

06:34.833 --> 06:35.791
Deaky!

06:36.291 --> 06:38.708
Get up!

06:39.208 --> 06:42.166
-My mutinous sons!

06:42.250 --> 06:44.916
-And back to work!
-Whoa! Uh, whoa!

06:47.000 --> 06:49.583
I felt her hand.

06:49.666 --> 06:50.500
Me too!

06:57.000 --> 07:01.083
<i>With my folks dead,</i>
<i>the next five years were hell.</i>

07:02.583 --> 07:04.708
<i>Yeah, I got into a little trouble.</i>

07:05.541 --> 07:07.375
<i>Okay, a lot of trouble.</i>

07:08.625 --> 07:09.833
<i>But at 13,</i>

07:10.625 --> 07:14.208
<i>I got a do-over</i>
<i>at this fancy girls' school, RBC.</i>

07:15.416 --> 07:16.916
<i>Only problem…</i>

07:18.416 --> 07:20.208
<i>…it was back in Rust Bank.</i>

07:50.208 --> 07:51.375
You okay, Kat?

07:52.041 --> 07:52.875
What?

07:52.958 --> 07:55.125
The bridge. You had a panic attack.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.750
I'm fine, Ms. Hunter.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.708
Dad's brewery.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.166
When did it burn down?

08:17.208 --> 08:18.875
It was at your parents' memorial.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.666
What?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.458
You were already
in the group home upstate.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.125
You didn't need more bad news.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.208
Was anyone hurt?

08:28.875 --> 08:29.708
It was bad.

08:37.250 --> 08:41.000
<i>Home definitely wasn't</i>
<i>what it used to be.</i>

08:41.708 --> 08:44.541
<i>Seems that brewery fire</i>
<i>had a domino effect,</i>

08:45.125 --> 08:46.916
<i>and the whole town had died.</i>

08:51.791 --> 08:53.458
What's this Klax Korp?

09:04.875 --> 09:07.083
My old house!

09:09.041 --> 09:10.208
<i>Good memories…</i>

09:12.541 --> 09:14.125
<i>they can hurt the most.</i>

09:17.375 --> 09:19.208
<i>But it wasn't just a do-over.</i>

09:19.708 --> 09:22.916
<i>Something else up at that school</i>
<i>was pulling me back.</i>

09:23.583 --> 09:25.750
<i>Something that knew what I was</i>

09:25.833 --> 09:27.083
<i>before I did.</i>

10:18.541 --> 10:20.375
Rust Bank Catholic.

10:21.875 --> 10:22.958
Fancy!

10:24.083 --> 10:26.625
Townies call it "Crust Stank."

10:27.208 --> 10:28.291
Okay, townie.

10:30.458 --> 10:32.083
What sort of girls go here?

10:32.916 --> 10:36.333
Prize poodles. All Best in Show.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.791
Whoa! It's Dad's Cyclops!

10:40.875 --> 10:42.583
Some other stuff too.

10:43.375 --> 10:47.583
Rust Bank Catholic was the first school
to sign up for "Break the Cycle."

10:47.666 --> 10:49.750
I promised you would behave.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.416
Yeah, well, I didn't.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.000
Can you at least try?

10:55.416 --> 10:57.916
I bet my grandma's
fry bread recipe on you.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.333
What the… What?

10:59.416 --> 11:00.916
So, you make this work!

11:07.083 --> 11:08.166
-Huh?

11:08.250 --> 11:09.333
-Pinch!
-Punch!

11:09.416 --> 11:10.583
First of the month!

11:10.666 --> 11:12.250
-Now you say…

11:12.333 --> 11:14.583
-"A slap and a kick for being so quick."
-What?

11:14.666 --> 11:16.083
Too slow!

11:16.166 --> 11:17.125
No returns!

11:19.541 --> 11:21.250
We are… Siobhan!

11:21.333 --> 11:22.333
Sweetie!

11:22.416 --> 11:23.250
Sloane!

11:23.333 --> 11:25.666
-And this is Gabby Goat.

11:25.750 --> 11:26.875
Welcome to…

11:26.958 --> 11:29.291
RBC Girls!

11:29.375 --> 11:30.291
Ugh.

11:30.375 --> 11:33.333
-Don't be shy, Katherine Koniqua Elliot.
-It's Kat!

11:33.833 --> 11:35.875
We've noodled up another idea.

11:35.958 --> 11:36.958
It's the cutest!

11:37.500 --> 11:38.833
Kay-Kay!

11:38.916 --> 11:40.666
Ugh! No, thanks!

11:40.750 --> 11:42.375
New name, new beginning!

11:42.458 --> 11:43.833
It's your do-over, Kay-Kay.

11:43.916 --> 11:46.500
-And we're going to help you heal.

11:46.583 --> 11:49.166
There's holistic goat yoga each noon.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.625
Feed your soul, not your waistline.

11:52.708 --> 11:55.333
Evenings, we meditate for the environment.

11:55.416 --> 11:57.750
The earth resonates beneath our bums.

11:57.833 --> 11:59.125
And best of all…

11:59.208 --> 12:02.333
Our "Fashion for World Peace" event!

12:02.416 --> 12:05.833
Who knows?
"Prison Chic" could be the next big thing.

12:05.916 --> 12:07.666
Now, let's get you moved in.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.208
Hey, don't touch!

12:09.791 --> 12:11.583
-What is it?
-It's vintage.

12:12.083 --> 12:12.916
Touched it!

12:22.708 --> 12:24.708
-What the--

12:25.500 --> 12:26.750
Hey, you!

12:28.333 --> 12:30.250
Did you see what she did?

12:30.333 --> 12:32.708
Kay-Kay just saved my life!

12:33.208 --> 12:34.208
Ah!

12:34.708 --> 12:36.083
Let go of me!

12:36.166 --> 12:40.125
-This way, Miss Elliot.
-Headmaster's waiting.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.833
What's going on, Siobhan?

12:45.916 --> 12:47.500
How did she see it coming?

12:48.041 --> 12:49.083
I don't know.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.875
But I have a feeling Kay-Kay's
the best thing to happen here

12:51.958 --> 12:53.166
in a long time.

12:57.375 --> 13:00.375
My door is always open!

13:02.333 --> 13:05.333
Ah! Welcome home, Miss Elliot,

13:05.416 --> 13:07.000
to Rust Bank.

13:10.916 --> 13:11.791
Ah?

13:13.458 --> 13:15.208
-Whoa!

13:19.583 --> 13:20.916
Oh, ow.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.416
-Ooh!

13:22.500 --> 13:27.500
And welcome to RBC Girls!

13:27.583 --> 13:30.208
I am Father Level Bests.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.750
And now, you're gonna kick me out.

13:32.833 --> 13:34.166
Oh, no!

13:34.250 --> 13:36.166
You just arrived, Miss Elliot.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.291
But you shoulda broke your back.

13:38.375 --> 13:40.375
I--

13:40.458 --> 13:43.791
Uh, God willing,
we're going to break the cycle.

13:44.291 --> 13:47.583
A second chance for girls like you. Yeah.

13:48.166 --> 13:52.583
This school's in trouble, isn't it?
You need that "Break the Cycle" money.

13:52.666 --> 13:56.375
Ah, and you… You need a fresh start.

13:56.458 --> 13:59.625
I told them,
bring this damaged child home.

13:59.708 --> 14:04.000
Surround her with the best and brightest,
and Katherine Koniqua Elliot--

14:04.083 --> 14:05.000
It's Kat!

14:05.083 --> 14:06.250
…will flourish.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.500
Ugh.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.666
You're an RBC Girl now.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.125
-Huh?

14:15.208 --> 14:17.791
A-ha. The Klaxons.

14:33.541 --> 14:35.833
Do not dawdle.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.083
Whoa.

15:34.583 --> 15:35.541
Kay-Kay?

15:47.708 --> 15:49.416
-Huh.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.708
You're the assassin!

15:50.791 --> 15:53.208
No, that brick was loose.

15:53.291 --> 15:56.375
Eyes ahead. You're drawing attention.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.916
-Thank God you saved her.
-I didn't.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.583
-She got lucky.
-She, uh…

16:02.708 --> 16:04.083
We used to be friends.

16:04.166 --> 16:05.791
You liked that prize poodle?

16:06.375 --> 16:07.208
Yeah.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.000
Why were you up that tower?

16:10.083 --> 16:12.750
It's an art project
for when the snow melts.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.541
I'm Raúl.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.708
I don't do friends, Raúl.

16:17.791 --> 16:20.708
Bad things happen to people I'm close to.

16:20.791 --> 16:22.083
Like what?

16:23.833 --> 16:25.041
They die.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.541
Whoa.

16:36.583 --> 16:37.833
Traitor.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.166
Sorry I'm late.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.125
Adaptable nature.

16:51.666 --> 16:52.500
Ha!

16:52.583 --> 16:57.416
Now, this spectacular creature
is called <i>Thaumoctopus mimicus,</i>

16:58.250 --> 17:00.083
the mimic octopus.

17:01.291 --> 17:06.750
It's the only creature that can change
its body shape to fool predators and prey.

17:08.250 --> 17:09.666
Holy biscuits!

17:09.750 --> 17:11.750
Ooh!

17:15.791 --> 17:16.625
Wow!

17:16.708 --> 17:18.291
Oh, my!

17:21.041 --> 17:22.166
That's amazing.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.416
Now, you look like an adaptable girl.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.541
It's Kat.

17:26.625 --> 17:30.958
Well, come on up, Kat.
Get a close-up of this marvelous mollusk!

17:33.875 --> 17:35.041
Kay-Kay!

17:46.791 --> 17:49.291
-Oh, no!
-What's happening?

17:49.375 --> 17:50.916
-Gabby!

17:53.375 --> 17:55.000
-Ahh!

18:01.041 --> 18:02.041
Okay.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.958
Slow, deep breaths, Kat.

18:07.791 --> 18:10.166
Um, let's take a look.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.500
-Oh!

18:15.583 --> 18:17.333
What's-- What's on my hand?

18:18.166 --> 18:22.208
Ah, okay.
You've never seen this before, right?

18:22.291 --> 18:23.291
Never.

18:23.958 --> 18:28.291
Uh, well, the mark proves
that you're special, Kat.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.458
But it has to be our secret.

18:31.541 --> 18:32.583
Huh?

18:32.666 --> 18:35.875
-That's how I can protect you.
-Protect me from what?

18:36.375 --> 18:38.958
That stupid octopus. It bit me, right?

18:39.041 --> 18:42.000
-It wasn't the octopus.
-You're just protecting your job!

18:44.333 --> 18:45.916
Tell no one, Kat!

18:48.083 --> 18:51.750
So, what do we believe
just happened? Sweetie?

18:51.833 --> 18:54.000
Kay-Kay is a sorceress!

18:54.083 --> 18:58.458
No, she's clearly telekinetic.
Her mind can move matter.

18:58.541 --> 19:02.208
Well, I would posit
that Kay-Kay is an interrupter.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.500
A disturber of the status quo.

19:04.583 --> 19:07.583
Oh, come on, Siobhan, leave her alone.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.041
It's none of your business, Ramona.

19:11.125 --> 19:14.416
-I'm sorry, Raúl. I keep forgetting.

19:18.708 --> 19:19.708
Look at it.

19:19.791 --> 19:23.583
Our faire is so much better
than Belzer's dump!

19:23.666 --> 19:26.916
But you couldn't keep your mouth shut.

19:27.625 --> 19:28.625
I know.

19:29.541 --> 19:31.583
I was braggin' to the wrong demon.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.291
Duh! When Belzer found out,

19:34.375 --> 19:37.250
he called this an insurrection,
a rebellion!

19:37.833 --> 19:39.541
Now, we're stuck here for life!

19:39.625 --> 19:41.625
Guess we got what we deserve.

19:41.708 --> 19:45.875
"We"?! You have not begun
to get what you deserve.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.708
-Whoa.
-It's a bearzabubble!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.666
From the Land of the Living!

20:10.500 --> 20:12.666
<i>Good news, cousins!</i>

20:12.750 --> 20:14.666
<i>You've got a Hell Maiden!</i>

20:15.875 --> 20:17.666
That's the girl in our vision!

20:17.750 --> 20:18.958
Same one!

20:19.041 --> 20:21.916
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>I've marked her hand so you'll know.</i>

20:22.000 --> 20:23.041
Marked her hand?

20:23.125 --> 20:24.500
<i>Rejoice!</i>

20:24.583 --> 20:27.708
<i>It's a new day in your miserable lives.</i>

20:31.500 --> 20:34.458
Hell Maidens are real, Wild.

20:34.541 --> 20:37.958
Imagine! She could summon us
to the Land of the Living!

20:38.041 --> 20:41.708
But-- But demons aren't allowed up there.
I mean, Belzer claims it's dangerous.

20:41.791 --> 20:45.166
Dangerous? Wild, he never even been there.

20:45.750 --> 20:49.333
Then that's where we'll build our faire!

20:50.458 --> 20:52.416
What?!

20:52.500 --> 20:55.750
That's amazing, Wild. You're right!
He would never know.

20:55.833 --> 20:58.208
-Stick it to the man!

20:58.291 --> 21:00.916
Shh! Not so loud.
We're right under his nose!

21:02.250 --> 21:03.500
So what do we do now?

21:03.583 --> 21:06.500
Think it's time to see our Hell Maiden.
Got any spare hair cream?

21:06.583 --> 21:10.666
Let the re-visioning begin.

21:14.583 --> 21:15.666
Look at them.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.958
Bloody council members
in their tiny houses.

21:20.833 --> 21:23.041
<i>They blocked our prison before, Lane…</i>

21:23.875 --> 21:27.291
and I'll blow beets
if they block us again!

21:28.541 --> 21:30.375
I'm not optimistic, Irmgard.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.833
Can't bribe them,
and they're-- they're too clever to be…

21:33.916 --> 21:35.666
"…retired."

21:38.291 --> 21:40.500
Well, I have good news.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.333
We have a new girl at RBC.

21:45.791 --> 21:47.500
Full tuition!

21:48.083 --> 21:51.375
Sweet Siobhan told Mummy all about her.

21:51.458 --> 21:54.875
Now the state's paying <i>him</i>
to take in criminals.

21:55.458 --> 22:00.583
That's our business model, Bests.
How dare you compete with Klax Korp!

22:00.666 --> 22:06.041
Well, technically,
it's not competing if you have no prison.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.250
-He's right, Lane.

22:08.333 --> 22:11.583
We need our own council members
to win the vote.

22:11.666 --> 22:15.916
Oh, yes, uh, the old-guard members.
They would vote for you!

22:16.000 --> 22:18.916
Ooh! Where do we find them, Father?

22:19.500 --> 22:23.500
In the finest mausoleums in the cemetery.

22:24.666 --> 22:26.125
They're dead?!

22:26.625 --> 22:28.583
It's over, Bests.

22:28.666 --> 22:32.333
We are no longer going to
prop you and your precious RBC up.

22:32.416 --> 22:36.083
Irmgard, Lane, I vouched for you
the night of the brewery fire.

22:37.416 --> 22:38.458
Indeed.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.250
Pop his clogs.

22:41.541 --> 22:42.625
What's that, then?

22:53.875 --> 22:56.750
Drowning is so peaceful.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.458
Indeed, sweet Irmgard.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.750
Really, Raúl, your art project, now?

23:12.833 --> 23:15.041
It's the final part of the mural, Mami.

23:17.458 --> 23:20.000
-Hi, Irwin. <i>¿Que pasa?</i>

23:20.083 --> 23:22.333
What do you mean,
"alleviate the situation?"

23:22.416 --> 23:25.666
-But I am your top-earning paralegal.

23:25.750 --> 23:28.375
My success rate is higher
than anyone on staff.

23:32.291 --> 23:35.125
But you know that I'm fighting
to keep my house, right?

23:35.916 --> 23:38.916
What am I supposed to do now?
I have a son to feed.

23:39.416 --> 23:41.583
No! A son, remember?

23:43.208 --> 23:44.041
Yes.

23:44.625 --> 23:46.541
I'm still investigating the fire.

23:46.625 --> 23:49.541
Look, Win, those workers were my friends,

23:49.625 --> 23:50.500
my neighbors.

23:51.666 --> 23:54.000
I-- I know the Klaxons are dangerous.

23:54.541 --> 23:58.333
But if I can link them to the fire,
we can stop the prison for good.

23:58.416 --> 24:00.625
-All I need is an eye wit--

24:00.708 --> 24:02.666
Oh, so that's it? We're done?

24:03.166 --> 24:05.541
Don't you dare hang up on me!

24:06.916 --> 24:07.916
Coward!

26:11.000 --> 26:14.416
I really, really need to talk to you.

26:35.125 --> 26:36.708
Look, almost home.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.500
-What, baby?

26:42.583 --> 26:43.416
Watch out!

26:43.500 --> 26:44.916
-No!

26:45.000 --> 26:46.250
-Delroy!

26:46.333 --> 26:48.500
Listen, listen to me, Kat.

26:48.583 --> 26:51.583
You need to swim like we taught you.
All the way up.

26:51.666 --> 26:53.791
-Aren't you coming?
-Right behind you, baby!

26:53.875 --> 26:55.000
Mama, I'm scared!

26:55.083 --> 26:58.875
Now, listen to me, baby.
You need to take a deep breath.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Now, go!

27:33.125 --> 27:35.875
Who are you?
What are you doing in my dream?

27:35.958 --> 27:37.666
Greetings, Hell Maiden!

27:37.750 --> 27:38.750
Me?

27:38.833 --> 27:40.916
Uh…
You-- You've got the mark, right?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.833
<i>Tell no one, Kat!</i>

27:43.333 --> 27:45.625
What mark? I don't have a mark.

27:45.708 --> 27:46.791
Sure, you do.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.583
It's right there.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.208
Hey!

27:50.291 --> 27:52.208
-What do you want?

27:52.291 --> 27:54.750
We are Wendell and Wild.

27:54.833 --> 27:57.500
-Your personal demons.
-Who?

27:57.583 --> 27:59.583
Well, you can summon us
to the Land of the Living.

27:59.666 --> 28:02.416
-Why would I do that?
-'Cause we'll give you whatever you want.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.958
Huh. Only thing I want is my parents.

28:06.875 --> 28:08.166
And they're dead.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.166
Uh-huh. Conference.

28:10.666 --> 28:13.916
-We can't raise the dead.
-Well, we do know how to lie.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.750
Oh! I like that plan.

28:16.333 --> 28:19.250
-No problemo!
-That's right! You do your bit…

28:19.333 --> 28:21.333
And we'll bring 'em back alive.

28:21.958 --> 28:23.125
That's ridiculous.

28:23.208 --> 28:25.333
-Well, I mean--
-What do you got to lose?

28:28.625 --> 28:30.958
Fine. So what do I do?

28:31.041 --> 28:35.083
-Okay, now, first, find Bearz-a-bub.
-What's a Bearz-a-bub?

28:35.166 --> 28:38.041
Finds Hell Maidens for demons.
Found you for us.

28:38.125 --> 28:40.375
-Well, it marked your hand so we'd know.
-Then what?

28:40.458 --> 28:44.000
Then, you take it
to the grave site next full moon.

28:44.083 --> 28:47.083
-It'll tell you what to do.
-Oh, yeah, one more thing!

28:47.166 --> 28:49.333
You gotta have a witness!

29:01.041 --> 29:02.041
Bearz-a-bub.

30:24.291 --> 30:25.458
Bearz-a-bub?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.083
<i>Thief!</i>

30:53.750 --> 30:55.416
Sister…

30:57.000 --> 31:01.125
Helley is a…

31:03.833 --> 31:04.916
thief!

31:05.000 --> 31:06.208
-Huh?
-Eh?

31:06.750 --> 31:10.208
Come back here, spy!

31:12.833 --> 31:14.208
-Hmm?

31:20.125 --> 31:21.791
Oh, Helley.

31:22.375 --> 31:24.416
You should have returned it.

31:25.875 --> 31:28.333
Now, we'll both be in the dark.

31:32.916 --> 31:37.250
Wakey-wakey, souls of the danged!

31:37.333 --> 31:42.000
It's your Scream Faire Daddy! Say my name!

31:42.083 --> 31:44.291
Belzer!

31:44.375 --> 31:45.416
Say my name!

31:46.000 --> 31:47.791
Belzer!

31:48.541 --> 31:49.791
Say my name!

31:49.875 --> 31:51.708
Belzer!

31:54.458 --> 31:58.250
Jeez! Can-- Can you believe
that vainglorious blowhard?

31:58.333 --> 32:00.500
It's love him, can't leave him.

32:00.583 --> 32:03.125
Danged souls <i>have</i> to praise him!

32:03.208 --> 32:06.666
At our faire, folks'll be lined up
wantin' to get in!

32:06.750 --> 32:07.583
Indeed!

32:08.083 --> 32:10.041
Only, how are we gonna pay for it?

32:10.125 --> 32:11.458
I know how.

32:11.541 --> 32:12.666
Yes, Wild?

32:12.750 --> 32:15.208
Remember that rich soul
of the danged?

32:15.291 --> 32:17.000
What, the-- the Nigerian Prince?

32:17.083 --> 32:20.333
Yeah. He said
if we helped him escape, he'd--

32:20.416 --> 32:23.250
That's nothing but a scam, Wild!

32:23.333 --> 32:25.250
That's sound financial planning!

32:25.333 --> 32:28.541
How 'bout I snap your horns off,
rub 'em together, and make a fire?

32:30.416 --> 32:32.291
Ugh! Disgusting!

32:39.666 --> 32:40.500
Huh?

32:43.833 --> 32:46.208
Stop the cart. Stop the cart!

32:46.791 --> 32:49.250
-All right, okay!

32:49.333 --> 32:51.791
That tick was dead.

32:52.291 --> 32:55.666
Why you messin' with me, Wild?
We got a serious problem to solve,

32:55.750 --> 32:57.166
and-- and you up here talkin'--

33:09.375 --> 33:10.208
Do it again!

33:15.625 --> 33:16.458
Whoa!

33:16.958 --> 33:18.458
See, Wendell?

33:18.541 --> 33:22.416
I bet folks would pay a lot
to come back from the dead, right?

33:23.291 --> 33:25.916
Yeah, sure, only that was just a tick.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
We need to test the cream
on something bigger.

33:32.416 --> 33:34.375
Hey, Spark Plug…

33:41.833 --> 33:45.500
Uh, what if we can't
bring him back to life?

33:45.583 --> 33:47.250
I couldn't live with myself.

33:48.333 --> 33:49.541
Me neither.

33:52.583 --> 33:55.375
Look, a full moon'll be rising soon!

33:55.458 --> 33:58.625
Got our very own Hell Maiden
to summon us up!

33:58.708 --> 34:01.166
We'll dig up her parents
and test the cream!

34:01.250 --> 34:02.166
And if it works?

34:02.250 --> 34:06.291
There'll be plenty of dough
to build our faire!

34:06.791 --> 34:09.416
Oh! Gonna need transportation funds.

34:21.125 --> 34:24.125
…we commend our brother…

34:37.041 --> 34:38.250
A full moon.

35:22.625 --> 35:26.500
Kay-Kay, sometimes it's harder
to let go when you've just met.

35:26.583 --> 35:27.791
No, it's not.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.750
Father Bests saved your life.

35:29.833 --> 35:32.500
Maybe he was just trying
to save the school.

35:32.583 --> 35:37.041
Kay-Kay, it's customary to cast
one's carnation on the lowering coffin.

35:37.125 --> 35:39.833
Not Kay-Kay! Not my custom.

35:40.416 --> 35:42.208
Time to say goodbye, Kay-Kay.

35:42.291 --> 35:43.750
Fine!

35:45.333 --> 35:46.541
Goodbye!

35:46.625 --> 35:47.666
-Oh!
-Aw!

35:50.166 --> 35:52.333
-You're comin' with me.
-What for?

35:52.416 --> 35:54.375
I need a witness, and you're it.

36:00.583 --> 36:04.291
Why do those poodles
keep bothering me?

36:04.375 --> 36:06.250
They want you to be like them.

36:06.750 --> 36:07.791
Heh.

36:08.791 --> 36:09.625
Uh…

36:10.166 --> 36:12.833
Wow, you were a poodle too.

36:13.333 --> 36:16.041
I… I tried to be but…

36:17.208 --> 36:19.041
You're not nearly as annoying.

36:20.166 --> 36:23.333
Siobhan's okay, considering her parents.

36:23.416 --> 36:24.458
Her parents?

36:24.541 --> 36:26.750
The Klaxons. Klax Korp?

36:27.458 --> 36:28.750
She's a Klaxon?

36:34.500 --> 36:36.083
There we go.

36:39.333 --> 36:41.625
And… boom, done, okay.

36:41.708 --> 36:43.708
Oh, gosh! Did I make
a sculpture or a mirror?

36:43.791 --> 36:45.750
You know what I'm sayin'?

36:46.666 --> 36:49.583
Oh. Nope. That's not gonna work.

36:50.916 --> 36:52.041
Well, there we go.

36:54.416 --> 36:57.000
I'm doin' somethin'--
I'm doin' somethin' important.

37:00.541 --> 37:03.625
Come on, Hell Maiden, summon us up!

37:12.625 --> 37:14.750
Ms. Hunter said it was bad.

37:23.833 --> 37:24.666
Come on.

37:26.958 --> 37:29.125
My mother thinks the fire was on purpose.

37:30.041 --> 37:31.458
Needs a witness to prove it.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.333
Hmm.

37:44.083 --> 37:47.333
Your parents?

37:48.125 --> 37:49.166
Mm-hmm.

37:56.833 --> 37:59.625
You're, uh, gonna make a shrine?

37:59.708 --> 38:00.541
Nope.

38:01.166 --> 38:03.791
Okay, now, tell me what to do.

38:04.333 --> 38:05.166
About what?

38:05.250 --> 38:06.708
Not you, Raúl, the bear.

38:11.041 --> 38:11.875
Ah!

38:19.416 --> 38:21.666
<i>Hand me to the Hell Maiden.</i>

38:21.750 --> 38:22.750
Hell Maiden?

38:24.750 --> 38:25.666
Kat.

38:25.750 --> 38:28.166
<i>Good. Now, repeat after me.</i>

38:28.250 --> 38:29.541
What's going on, Kat?

38:29.625 --> 38:32.208
Look, I made a deal.
I'm bringing my parents back.

38:32.708 --> 38:33.583
What?

38:33.666 --> 38:34.500
Shush!

38:35.458 --> 38:39.041
<i>Per Virginem</i>
<i>facultates, infernum…</i>

38:39.833 --> 38:43.583
Per Virginem facultates, infernum…

38:44.708 --> 38:46.541
<i>…aperire portas…</i>

38:47.041 --> 38:49.291
…aperire portas…

38:50.041 --> 38:54.166
<i>…ut redeat</i>
<i>daemones parentibus.</i>

38:54.250 --> 38:58.791
…ut redeat daemones parentibus.

39:11.041 --> 39:13.625
I've got the cream here.
I'm gonna put this…

39:23.041 --> 39:25.041
It's the summoning!

39:25.666 --> 39:27.958
-The summoning!
-The summoning spell!

39:28.041 --> 39:29.791
-The summoning spell!

39:32.708 --> 39:33.625
Let's go!

39:33.708 --> 39:36.083
Flap it! Flap it! Flap it! Flap it!

39:36.166 --> 39:38.083
-Flap it! Flap it!
-Here we go!

39:38.166 --> 39:39.875
Attaboy, Sparky.
Attaboy, Sparky.

39:39.958 --> 39:41.666
-Shhh…

39:41.750 --> 39:44.333
Easy, Sparky, easy. Here we go…

39:44.416 --> 39:46.125
Way to go, Soul Jockeys!

39:46.875 --> 39:49.166
-Whoa!

39:56.500 --> 39:57.875
Oh!

39:59.791 --> 40:01.625
Go back to sleep,
go back to sleep!

40:03.833 --> 40:05.000
Ooh, that was close!

40:19.083 --> 40:20.166
What?

40:20.750 --> 40:22.125
Yes!

40:36.000 --> 40:39.083
-Hi-ho, Hell Maiden!

40:39.166 --> 40:40.916
We're here!

40:41.000 --> 40:42.541
-Whoo!

40:47.250 --> 40:49.083
Um… Yoo-hoo?

40:49.166 --> 40:52.083
Don't be shy, now!

40:55.041 --> 40:56.291
No, no, please!

40:57.375 --> 40:58.458
Come on!

40:58.541 --> 41:01.666
Say something! Tell me what to do! Please!

41:06.791 --> 41:07.875
They lied to me!

41:29.083 --> 41:30.250
Well…

41:30.333 --> 41:32.750
Hi, Sister Helley.

41:32.833 --> 41:34.500
Why weren't you two on the bus?

41:34.583 --> 41:38.291
-Uh, Kat needed me to be a witness?
-It's my fault.

41:39.083 --> 41:41.333
Didn't want to see
my parents' grave alone.

41:41.833 --> 41:42.958
I see.

41:43.541 --> 41:48.291
Well, we have a long, cold walk back.

41:51.125 --> 41:52.833
Eh, she'll show up at some point.

41:53.583 --> 41:54.750
Meanwhile…

41:54.833 --> 41:56.833
I say it's time to test the cream!

41:59.000 --> 42:01.625
Look, a fresh-dug grave!

42:02.583 --> 42:05.416
-Time to eat dirt, Sparky!

42:14.208 --> 42:16.291
-Here we go.

42:20.125 --> 42:23.708
Ooh, that is one
messed-up man of the cloth.

42:23.791 --> 42:28.041
Sure, but if we can raise him up,
we can raise up anyone in the cemetery.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.500
-Wendell?
-Mm-hmm?

42:40.583 --> 42:41.791
It's not working.

42:45.375 --> 42:46.416
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

42:46.500 --> 42:48.208
-It worked!
-Whoo!

42:53.000 --> 42:54.875
-Who did it?
-We did it!

42:54.958 --> 42:57.875
Dear God! I'm in Hell!

42:57.958 --> 42:59.375
No way, Padre!

42:59.458 --> 43:02.208
You're back
in good ol' Rust Bank, fully alive!

43:03.458 --> 43:06.000
Thank you, Lord, for this miracle!

43:06.083 --> 43:08.000
Not Him! We brought you back!

43:08.083 --> 43:09.500
-What?
-Wendell and Wild!

43:09.583 --> 43:11.958
You? But you're demons.

43:12.041 --> 43:15.916
Don't worry, Padre.
We are the Magician Morticians.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.208
The <i>artistes</i> of the afterlife.

43:23.583 --> 43:25.166
-Okay.

43:28.791 --> 43:29.625
And…

43:30.208 --> 43:31.625
Ta-da!

43:32.916 --> 43:35.875
Y-Y-Your work is remarkable!

43:37.041 --> 43:39.958
Now, as far as payment goes…

43:40.500 --> 43:42.125
Um, uh, I have to pay you?

43:42.625 --> 43:43.541
How much?

43:43.625 --> 43:45.000
Everything you've got.

43:45.083 --> 43:48.000
Yeah, we're gonna build
the best bemusement park ever!

43:48.083 --> 43:51.250
-We're gonna call it the Dream Faire!
-Huh?

43:51.333 --> 43:54.625
And you, and all your neighbors
around here, gonna pay for it.

43:55.958 --> 43:59.375
I-- I-- I need to show you something.

43:59.458 --> 44:01.083
-Huh?
-Come.

44:04.583 --> 44:08.125
This… is Rust Bank.

44:08.916 --> 44:09.875
Take a look.

44:12.875 --> 44:13.750
No jobs.

44:14.958 --> 44:15.958
No banks.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.916
No people.

44:19.958 --> 44:20.958
Go ahead,

44:21.583 --> 44:23.541
raise all the dead you want,

44:23.625 --> 44:26.916
but there's no one here
to pay for this faire.

44:36.083 --> 44:40.000
What's to stop us from puttin'
your janky ass back in the ground?

44:40.583 --> 44:43.916
Yeah, your janky, stanky ass.

44:45.916 --> 44:47.041
He's right, Lane.

44:47.125 --> 44:50.416
We need our own council members
to win the vote.

44:50.500 --> 44:53.208
Oh, yes, uh, the old-guard members.

44:53.291 --> 44:55.000
They would vote for you!

44:56.041 --> 44:57.500
W-W-Wait! Wait.

44:57.583 --> 44:59.083
I just had a vision.

44:59.166 --> 45:03.791
Uh, uh, the Klaxons, uh, would
gladly pay for your services.

45:03.875 --> 45:06.916
-Enough to build our Dream Faire?
-With all the trimmings?

45:07.000 --> 45:11.791
Uh-huh. All that,
and enough to save my school.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.458
Well, here we are, Kat.

45:21.375 --> 45:23.583
Just tell me one thing before you go.

45:24.208 --> 45:25.958
Is our secret safe?

45:29.791 --> 45:32.375
I know what you are, Kat.
You're a Hell Maiden.

45:32.958 --> 45:34.416
But how could you know that?

45:34.500 --> 45:37.166
I'm… kind of an expert.

45:38.125 --> 45:41.916
And you do not want
certain parties finding out about you.

45:42.791 --> 45:44.333
Why do you care about me?

45:44.833 --> 45:47.875
I care because I was just like you.

45:47.958 --> 45:50.166
Oh, so you were stupid too!

45:50.250 --> 45:54.041
-You aren't stupid, Kat.
-Stupid enough to get my parents killed!

45:54.125 --> 45:56.125
Stupid enough to just watch 'em drown,

45:56.208 --> 45:59.333
not even try to help!
Stupid enough to believe they could ever--

45:59.416 --> 46:02.291
Stop! It couldn't have
all been your fault, Kat.

46:02.375 --> 46:04.416
You're nothing like me!

46:15.458 --> 46:18.833
We were so worried, Kay-Kay,
when you didn't get on the bus.

46:18.916 --> 46:21.541
-Where were you?
-You gonna arrest me, Klax Korp?

46:21.625 --> 46:24.541
-Arrest you?
-You <i>are</i> the prison people.

46:24.625 --> 46:26.958
Why, yes, private prisons.

46:27.041 --> 46:30.375
With trauma therapy,
full detox, and whole-being cleanses.

46:30.458 --> 46:32.500
You ever been inside a private prison?

46:33.000 --> 46:33.958
Well, no.

46:40.041 --> 46:41.125
I didn't think so.

46:48.250 --> 46:49.250
It's the cutest.

46:49.333 --> 46:50.750
That dream you had…

46:53.625 --> 46:57.041
Maybe it was just some students
messing with you.

46:57.125 --> 46:59.791
I said they were demons, Raúl!

46:59.875 --> 47:02.750
My personal demons. And they lied!

47:04.000 --> 47:06.250
Hmm. Maybe demons aren't
the most trustworthy creatures

47:06.333 --> 47:07.375
to make a deal with.

47:09.916 --> 47:12.083
-<i>Good morning, RBC!</i>

47:12.166 --> 47:14.833
<i>It's your very own Father Bests.</i>

47:14.916 --> 47:19.416
<i>Reports of my death</i>
<i>were greatly exaggerated.</i>

47:19.500 --> 47:20.750
What?!

47:20.833 --> 47:22.833
<i>So, I am back on the job,</i>

47:22.916 --> 47:27.458
<i>guiding this glorious institution</i>
<i>into the future.</i>

47:28.708 --> 47:30.708
It's dear Father Bests!

47:30.791 --> 47:31.916
-Alive!
-Oh, my God!

47:32.000 --> 47:33.500
All right, everyone!

47:33.583 --> 47:36.958
-Everyone, okay. Please, stay calm!

47:37.041 --> 47:39.750
-Just--
-It's got to be a miracle, right?

47:41.666 --> 47:43.833
-Whoo!

47:50.666 --> 47:51.958
-Come on!

47:53.541 --> 47:54.375
Kay-Kay?

47:59.833 --> 48:04.291
They were supposed
to bring my parents back, not you!

48:05.875 --> 48:08.166
Oh, uh, my-my… Oh, my!

48:08.250 --> 48:10.083
Really, Miss Elliot?

48:10.166 --> 48:11.083
Ugh!

48:11.166 --> 48:14.250
Perhaps, I'm just more important

48:15.291 --> 48:17.000
than your parents.

48:17.083 --> 48:20.666
Oh, you creepy old dude!

48:20.750 --> 48:24.083
Forgive me, Father,
but you wouldn't even be here without Kat.

48:24.791 --> 48:27.041
How is that, exactly?

48:27.125 --> 48:28.833
She's the one who summoned those demons--

48:28.916 --> 48:30.333
-Shh!
-Ow!

48:30.416 --> 48:33.708
Well, if you can't explain yourselves,

48:33.791 --> 48:35.875
I have better things to do.

48:37.791 --> 48:40.250
Code seven, code seven!

48:40.333 --> 48:42.333
Hostage situation in the headmaster's--

48:42.416 --> 48:44.500
-What?!
-Penguins deploy!

48:44.583 --> 48:47.000
We're not holding you hostage.

48:47.083 --> 48:50.000
Uh, children, life is precious.

48:50.583 --> 48:53.208
Right now, you're wasting mine.

48:53.291 --> 48:55.208
-Girlie, move it!

49:06.583 --> 49:08.500
What the bloody hell?

49:09.166 --> 49:10.333
Bests' phone!

49:17.666 --> 49:20.375
Father Bests, undead.

49:20.458 --> 49:22.833
-Hmm.
-How's it possible, Manberg?

49:24.666 --> 49:26.916
Remember your first demon, Helley?

49:27.416 --> 49:30.250
You were just 12 when we captured it.

49:30.333 --> 49:32.791
Yes, made me summon demons,

49:32.875 --> 49:35.916
just so you could add them
to your stupid collection.

49:36.458 --> 49:41.416
I made you my right foot of justice,
and you quit on me!

49:41.500 --> 49:43.500
It had nothing to do with justice!

49:43.583 --> 49:45.041
It was entrapment.

49:45.916 --> 49:46.791
It was wrong.

49:56.583 --> 50:00.041
There's a new Hell Maiden
at RBC, isn't there?

50:00.125 --> 50:03.208
She's… She's safe!

50:03.291 --> 50:06.166
My bear would've told me she'd arrived,

50:06.250 --> 50:09.041
given me time to train and protect her.

50:09.125 --> 50:11.500
But you stole it from me.

50:11.583 --> 50:15.625
And the new Hell Maiden
has stolen it from you.

50:24.041 --> 50:25.916
I'll be waiting, Helley.

50:59.750 --> 51:00.708
Uh…

51:02.583 --> 51:03.458
Hmm.

51:17.041 --> 51:18.916
-No laughing.
-Back to work!

51:41.958 --> 51:43.458
Manberg was right.

51:51.166 --> 51:52.000
Finally.

51:56.166 --> 51:58.666
Sister Daley!
Sister Chinstrap!

52:03.083 --> 52:04.541
Come on, wake up!

52:07.791 --> 52:08.916
You're going alone?

52:09.708 --> 52:10.875
They're demons!

52:10.958 --> 52:13.166
My demons, Raúl, my problem.

52:15.541 --> 52:16.750
Open the door.

52:16.833 --> 52:18.291
-It's an emergency!
-Oh!

52:19.375 --> 52:21.125
-Chinstrap!
-Oh!

52:21.208 --> 52:22.166
-Wake up!
-Ooh!

52:25.041 --> 52:27.375
Now, where are Kat and Raúl?

52:39.250 --> 52:40.500
Kat!

52:41.916 --> 52:43.416
Raúl!

52:45.500 --> 52:47.750
It sounded just like him on the phone.

52:48.875 --> 52:50.250
It couldn't have been.

52:50.333 --> 52:52.000
We drowned him right here.

52:57.458 --> 53:00.416
-You're supposed to be dead!
-You look bloody hideous!

53:00.500 --> 53:02.000
I like my new look.

53:03.375 --> 53:05.041
-Get him, Lane!

53:05.125 --> 53:07.583
-Come here, you little…

53:07.666 --> 53:08.500
-Oh!

53:08.583 --> 53:10.791
Gonna pop your clogs permanently!

53:11.750 --> 53:14.458
Wait! I-I-I can get you the votes!

53:15.041 --> 53:16.791
-Ah!
-For our new prison?

53:17.375 --> 53:18.708
-How?

53:18.791 --> 53:20.416
The council votes tomorrow!

53:21.166 --> 53:23.500
These are my partners,

53:24.000 --> 53:25.375
Wendell and Wild.

53:27.041 --> 53:29.208
Um, we raised Padre, here.

53:29.291 --> 53:30.166
From the dead.

53:30.750 --> 53:35.083
Now, they can raise
the old-guard members you need.

53:35.750 --> 53:37.708
The ones rotting in the cemetery?

53:37.791 --> 53:40.333
Sure! Have 'em all cleaned up,
ready to vote by morning.

53:40.916 --> 53:43.541
-Yes!

53:43.625 --> 53:45.166
Get those prison votes,

53:45.250 --> 53:47.833
and we'll make you rich.

53:47.916 --> 53:50.708
Rich enough to build our Dream Faire?

53:50.791 --> 53:51.708
Certainly!

53:51.791 --> 53:54.250
We'll pull the permits,
fast-track construction--

53:54.333 --> 53:55.500
And Bob's your uncle!

53:56.333 --> 53:59.000
What about my school?

53:59.083 --> 54:00.500
Of course, Father.

54:00.583 --> 54:04.250
RBC shall have
our full financial support now!

54:06.416 --> 54:07.625
Mmm.

54:08.583 --> 54:12.333
Those brewery workers are
in the same cemetery.

54:13.166 --> 54:14.291
Gah!

54:14.875 --> 54:18.375
By the way, do you plan to raise
anyone else from the dead?

54:18.458 --> 54:21.083
Well, uh, our Hell Maiden's parents--

54:21.166 --> 54:23.833
No, no! No, no, no, no, no!

54:23.916 --> 54:26.666
If you raise anyone else in the cemetery--

54:26.750 --> 54:30.750
It's no funfair, no RBC money!

54:30.833 --> 54:33.250
-What? Hey, wait a minute--
-I promise!

54:33.333 --> 54:36.458
Just your voters
will be raised.

54:37.750 --> 54:39.875
Fine. Toodle-pip!

54:46.250 --> 54:48.500
Well, there they are, Wild.

54:48.583 --> 54:50.291
The old-guard graves?

54:50.791 --> 54:53.583
Exactly. All parked in a row.

54:53.666 --> 54:54.916
How convenient!

54:56.083 --> 54:57.416
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

54:57.500 --> 55:00.291
-What's wrong, boy?

55:02.041 --> 55:03.083
Ow!

55:03.166 --> 55:04.583
Where were you?

55:04.666 --> 55:06.500
Hell Maiden!

55:06.583 --> 55:07.625
Stop! Stop it!

55:07.708 --> 55:09.666
You promised my parents!

55:09.750 --> 55:11.208
Ch-- Wha-- You weren't here!

55:11.291 --> 55:15.500
Yeah, you weren't up in here.
So, we-- we made Bests our guinea pig.

55:15.583 --> 55:16.958
-Uh-huh.
-Check this out.

55:18.250 --> 55:20.125
Ooh! What's that?

55:20.208 --> 55:21.708
Oh, that's our secret sauce.

55:21.791 --> 55:23.458
That stuff'll bring my parents back?

55:23.541 --> 55:25.125
-Yep.
-Um…

55:25.208 --> 55:27.041
Great! Let's go!

55:27.875 --> 55:30.750
Klaxon said game over
if we raise anyone else!

55:30.833 --> 55:33.291
-Ho-Ho-Ho-Hold on, now! Hold on.
-Not just yet! See…

55:33.375 --> 55:35.916
That-- That-- That's not
how it works… anymore.

55:36.416 --> 55:39.458
-Mmm.
-Well, first, you got to… to…

55:39.541 --> 55:41.333
-To swear allegiance.

55:41.416 --> 55:43.625
-That's right!
-That wasn't the deal!

55:43.708 --> 55:47.875
Hell Maiden,
do you promise to serve us…

55:49.666 --> 55:53.125
For all eternity!

55:53.208 --> 55:55.583
-You've gotta be kidding me.
-Stop, Kat!

55:55.666 --> 55:56.916
-Stop!

55:57.000 --> 55:59.791
-Leave it, Raúl!

55:59.875 --> 56:02.041
-The heck is he doin' up there?

56:02.958 --> 56:03.791
Fine.

56:04.875 --> 56:05.916
I…

56:06.000 --> 56:08.416
swear it.

56:14.250 --> 56:15.375
What'd you do, Wild?

56:15.458 --> 56:17.625
Wasn't me, Wendell. Skull mouth did it.

56:18.375 --> 56:19.208
Huh.

56:19.750 --> 56:20.583
Uh…

56:21.083 --> 56:23.708
Uh, for your first task…

56:23.791 --> 56:26.958
I know! Get us some take-out.
We're starving!

56:27.041 --> 56:30.333
Only place left
is… Fawzi's Falafel.

56:30.416 --> 56:31.333
I'll help.

56:31.416 --> 56:32.541
Oh, no.

56:32.625 --> 56:35.000
You and Sparky got graves to dig.

56:35.083 --> 56:38.625
Warned you, Raúl,
bad things happen to people I'm close to.

56:44.541 --> 56:46.625
Come on, we haven't got all night.

56:58.250 --> 56:59.083
One…

57:01.291 --> 57:04.458
…two, three, four, five…

57:06.125 --> 57:09.041
-Six.

57:10.875 --> 57:13.333
-Ahh!

57:13.416 --> 57:16.291
-Here we go!

57:24.708 --> 57:26.666
-Welcome back!

57:26.750 --> 57:28.333
-Good to see you!

57:41.125 --> 57:42.916
Makeover time, let's go!

57:43.000 --> 57:45.291
Makeover time!

57:49.166 --> 57:50.000
Hello!

57:54.375 --> 57:55.458
Come on out.

57:59.625 --> 58:02.250
-Remember, vote pro-prison!

58:09.291 --> 58:10.250
Woo-hoo!

58:10.333 --> 58:14.083
-Whoa, that group was challenging!
-Little dab to celebrate?

58:15.791 --> 58:17.541
-What are you doing?

58:17.625 --> 58:19.000
Ticklin' our tummies.

58:19.083 --> 58:21.625
Hey, we earned it.

58:21.708 --> 58:22.541
Stop!

58:23.333 --> 58:25.833
There won't be any left for Kat's parents!

58:25.916 --> 58:29.875
I love
that little Hell Maiden, but…

58:29.958 --> 58:32.208
If we raise her parents,

58:32.291 --> 58:34.833
the Klaxons won't build our Dream Faire.

58:34.916 --> 58:35.750
Mm-hmm.

59:04.625 --> 59:06.750
I am so happy you're back, Kat!

59:07.875 --> 59:10.208
Rust Bank needs some bright colors.

59:10.791 --> 59:13.000
Smells so good, Mr. Fawzi.

59:13.083 --> 59:15.333
You want the hot sauce, right?

59:15.916 --> 59:18.125
-Yeah.
-Take the whole bottle.

59:19.666 --> 59:22.250
-And hey, don't be a stranger, hmm?
-Thanks.

59:28.625 --> 59:29.500
Okay.

59:58.666 --> 59:59.750
Delroy.

59:59.833 --> 1:00:00.666
Wilma?

1:00:00.750 --> 1:00:02.916
What… h-happened?

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:07.625
Uh, hey. You two need to head to town.

1:00:07.708 --> 1:00:08.541
Find Kat.

1:00:09.250 --> 1:00:10.416
Kat's here?

1:00:11.208 --> 1:00:12.083
Yes.

1:00:14.125 --> 1:00:15.458
What's your name, son?

1:00:16.666 --> 1:00:18.791
Raúl. Now, please, hurry!

1:00:32.333 --> 1:00:35.166
-You stole our cream, Raúl.

1:00:35.250 --> 1:00:37.791
Raised up our Hell Maiden's parents!

1:00:42.250 --> 1:00:45.375
Something ain't right up there.

1:00:50.541 --> 1:00:52.416
Wake up, you bums.

1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:54.375
Got a hair emergency.

1:00:54.958 --> 1:00:56.666
Wake up, c'mon, wake up!

1:00:57.166 --> 1:00:58.000
Fine.

1:01:00.250 --> 1:01:03.875
Ugh. You boys look terrible.

1:01:05.958 --> 1:01:06.791
What?

1:01:06.875 --> 1:01:07.750
Hmm!

1:01:08.375 --> 1:01:09.875
Soul Jockeys!

1:01:10.375 --> 1:01:12.000
On the double!

1:01:19.750 --> 1:01:21.041
What the…

1:01:30.875 --> 1:01:32.166
Yeah!

1:01:41.833 --> 1:01:42.666
Hey!

1:01:56.125 --> 1:01:58.416
How many dead folks have they raised?

1:02:08.791 --> 1:02:09.791
What?

1:02:21.833 --> 1:02:23.291
-Ah!

1:03:08.250 --> 1:03:09.541
Is that you, Kat?

1:03:10.083 --> 1:03:12.458
You've grown so much!

1:03:12.541 --> 1:03:14.458
Mom! Dad!

1:03:20.875 --> 1:03:22.500
-It's-- It's okay.

1:03:23.250 --> 1:03:24.500
I got you back.

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:27.375
-Aw!

1:03:29.708 --> 1:03:30.833
Mmm.

1:03:30.916 --> 1:03:35.541
It's so wonderful to see you, Kat,
but how is this possible?

1:03:35.625 --> 1:03:37.625
Why are we alive now?

1:03:39.041 --> 1:03:40.458
Doesn't matter, does it?

1:03:42.083 --> 1:03:45.166
Hey! I still have the Cyclops, Dad.

1:03:45.666 --> 1:03:48.750
That boom box could shake
a room.

1:03:48.833 --> 1:03:50.083
And this too, Mom.

1:03:50.166 --> 1:03:52.833
Was wondering where that went. Hmm.

1:03:53.416 --> 1:03:57.000
I swear
I told these people no deal.

1:03:57.958 --> 1:04:01.083
Damn Klax Korp signs are everywhere!

1:04:01.166 --> 1:04:04.250
You're a lot tougher, aren't you?

1:04:04.333 --> 1:04:05.333
Had to be,

1:04:06.166 --> 1:04:07.166
since I…

1:04:08.708 --> 1:04:09.625
I killed you.

1:04:09.708 --> 1:04:11.250
You-- You didn't kill us, Kat.

1:04:11.333 --> 1:04:13.958
Only reason you crashed
is 'cause I screamed.

1:04:14.041 --> 1:04:16.083
It was an accident, Kat.

1:04:16.166 --> 1:04:17.625
You were only eight, Kat.

1:04:17.708 --> 1:04:20.083
-Your-- Your hand!

1:04:20.166 --> 1:04:21.458
-Whoa!

1:04:21.541 --> 1:04:22.916
Wha-- Wha-- What?

1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:24.333
Kat!

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.791
Wh-Whoa!

1:04:32.166 --> 1:04:35.833
Look, I made this deal
with some demon brothers.

1:04:36.416 --> 1:04:38.500
-Demons?
-Demons? Why?

1:04:38.583 --> 1:04:40.958
Because they promised
to bring you back to life.

1:04:41.041 --> 1:04:42.541
And they did!

1:04:42.625 --> 1:04:46.083
It wasn't demons. It was--
It was this kid, Raúl.

1:04:46.166 --> 1:04:47.458
Raúl?

1:04:47.541 --> 1:04:48.958
Said he was your friend.

1:04:49.625 --> 1:04:51.625
I-- I don't have friends.

1:04:52.250 --> 1:04:54.875
-He's in danger, isn't he?
-Maybe.

1:04:54.958 --> 1:04:57.583
If he's in danger,
then we gotta go help him.

1:04:58.166 --> 1:04:59.708
But I just got you back!

1:04:59.791 --> 1:05:02.041
Friends are like family, Kat.

1:05:02.125 --> 1:05:04.375
We do whatever we can for them.

1:05:05.041 --> 1:05:08.458
Fine, fine! I'll take care of Raúl.

1:05:08.541 --> 1:05:11.500
You two just stay in the house
where I can find you again.

1:05:14.083 --> 1:05:15.458
Save him, baby.

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:17.000
But be careful.

1:05:17.625 --> 1:05:21.000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
What are we gonna do, Wendell?

1:05:21.083 --> 1:05:23.583
If the Klaxons find out,
our faire is toast!

1:05:23.666 --> 1:05:26.583
-You gotta tell the Padre.
-No, <i>you </i>have to tell him.

1:05:26.666 --> 1:05:29.541
You're older, Wendell.
You have to do it.

1:05:30.833 --> 1:05:34.083
Pipe down, Spark Plug!
Can't hear ourselves think!

1:06:00.500 --> 1:06:01.708
-Kat!
-Shh!

1:06:17.583 --> 1:06:20.125
I swear--

1:06:23.708 --> 1:06:25.250
-You hear somethin'?

1:06:25.333 --> 1:06:28.041
I smell somethin'. Our falafel dinner?

1:06:32.916 --> 1:06:35.583
You greedy bug's turd!

1:06:35.666 --> 1:06:37.750
You ate our Hell Maiden!

1:06:39.541 --> 1:06:41.333
Oh, and you ate
little Raúl as well.

1:06:44.541 --> 1:06:48.000
I am literally traumatized!

1:06:50.291 --> 1:06:52.333
I'mma miss this cream when it's gone.

1:06:52.416 --> 1:06:54.375
Yeah, well, not as much as old Belzer.

1:06:57.375 --> 1:06:59.958
Where are they?

1:07:03.166 --> 1:07:08.666
So, you took my last two sons
to the Land of the Living?

1:07:11.291 --> 1:07:13.458
With my magic hair cream?

1:07:13.541 --> 1:07:14.833
Mm-hmm.

1:07:15.416 --> 1:07:18.250
See? That wasn't so hard, right?

1:07:18.333 --> 1:07:19.166
No.

1:07:26.250 --> 1:07:27.708
Thanks for saving me.

1:07:28.791 --> 1:07:30.625
We're still not friends, Raúl.

1:07:34.291 --> 1:07:35.750
You stole Bearz-a-bub.

1:07:38.458 --> 1:07:40.583
And you summoned your demons.

1:07:40.666 --> 1:07:42.916
Let go! My parents are waiting.

1:07:43.500 --> 1:07:45.916
Your… dead parents?

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:47.666
It was my fault they died.

1:07:47.750 --> 1:07:50.375
I had to get them back. Let go of me!

1:07:50.458 --> 1:07:53.000
Demons can't bring back the dead.

1:07:53.083 --> 1:07:55.791
Well, they had this magic hair cream.

1:07:56.833 --> 1:07:57.833
Uh…

1:08:02.125 --> 1:08:05.708
Raúl, tell Kat's parents
I'll need her for a while.

1:08:05.791 --> 1:08:09.083
Why should I do
anything you tell me?

1:08:12.833 --> 1:08:15.125
You too?

1:08:15.208 --> 1:08:16.833
That's right.

1:08:31.666 --> 1:08:34.625
-Manberg, we need your help.

1:08:35.208 --> 1:08:36.208
Really?

1:08:37.625 --> 1:08:38.791
My bear!

1:08:39.416 --> 1:08:42.166
Oh, have you missed me, evil thing?

1:08:42.250 --> 1:08:44.083
Now, Manberg.

1:08:44.583 --> 1:08:45.625
Fine, fine.

1:08:48.166 --> 1:08:50.000
-Wow.

1:08:50.083 --> 1:08:53.916
-She has sworn allegiance to her demons.

1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:57.500
-And the fever is spreading.

1:08:58.083 --> 1:08:59.083
My fault.

1:08:59.583 --> 1:09:02.833
-Well, only one thing to do…

1:09:03.666 --> 1:09:05.583
Full quarantine!

1:09:07.750 --> 1:09:11.041
You--
You don't understand, Manberg.

1:09:11.125 --> 1:09:14.208
Kat's demons are raising
an army of the dead!

1:09:14.291 --> 1:09:16.250
A whole army, you say?

1:09:16.333 --> 1:09:20.666
Yes! And we'll need
two Hell Maidens to stop them!

1:09:23.375 --> 1:09:25.041
So, now what?

1:09:25.625 --> 1:09:28.916
-Blood-bind us, Manberg.

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.916
Blood-bind could kill you.

1:09:31.416 --> 1:09:32.958
Just do it!

1:09:35.916 --> 1:09:37.083
Ah!

1:09:45.333 --> 1:09:48.000
Now, open the Redemption Chamber, Manberg.

1:10:00.625 --> 1:10:03.500
-Worst bunions ever!

1:10:03.583 --> 1:10:05.708
There's nothin' to be happy about anymore.

1:10:05.791 --> 1:10:08.583
Don't need this kind of aggravation.

1:10:09.250 --> 1:10:13.458
Some say Rust Bank is already lost,
a ghost town.

1:10:13.541 --> 1:10:16.583
-Oy!
-So, why block Klax Korp again?

1:10:17.291 --> 1:10:21.125
Because I know they caused
the fire that killed our friends

1:10:21.208 --> 1:10:22.541
and destroyed this town.

1:10:22.625 --> 1:10:26.625
-You're preaching to the choir, honey.
-Let's get to voting!

1:10:26.708 --> 1:10:28.000
Of course, ladies.

1:10:28.666 --> 1:10:32.833
All here in favor of Klax Korp Prison,
raise your right hand.

1:10:32.916 --> 1:10:35.000
-Boo!
-Over my dead body!

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:37.916
Now, all opposed.

1:10:41.875 --> 1:10:43.791
-Ooh! Zombies?

1:10:43.875 --> 1:10:46.208
-Corpses!
-We're being invaded!

1:10:46.291 --> 1:10:51.291
Uh,<i> perdóname</i>, but this is--
is council members only!

1:10:53.833 --> 1:10:56.291
Colonel Bumstrop, is that you?

1:10:59.125 --> 1:11:02.750
My Lord, Cassandra,
it's the old-guard members!

1:11:02.833 --> 1:11:05.333
But they died! Years ago!

1:11:05.416 --> 1:11:08.875
In my professional opinion,
these men are alive.

1:11:08.958 --> 1:11:11.583
Come on, Doc, you're just a foot guy.

1:11:11.666 --> 1:11:14.208
-Podiatrists are real doctors--

1:11:14.291 --> 1:11:15.125
Shh!

1:11:18.708 --> 1:11:23.041
It seems they do have a right to be here
and the right to vote.

1:11:23.125 --> 1:11:25.458
Mariana, have you lost your mind?

1:11:25.541 --> 1:11:29.416
I have to, Fawzi.
All living council members get to vote.

1:11:32.125 --> 1:11:35.166
All those in favor
of Klax Korp Prison,

1:11:35.250 --> 1:11:36.791
raise your right hand.

1:11:42.041 --> 1:11:44.291
The yays have it, six to five.

1:11:46.875 --> 1:11:50.708
Holy moly! Can that really be correct?

1:11:50.791 --> 1:11:53.250
-Their votes actually count?

1:11:54.333 --> 1:11:55.166
<i>Sí.</i>

1:11:56.250 --> 1:11:58.083
They won.

1:11:58.166 --> 1:11:59.583
-No!

1:12:00.791 --> 1:12:02.666
Finally!

1:12:02.750 --> 1:12:06.375
Oh, excellent work, Father!

1:12:06.458 --> 1:12:08.083
-Hear, hear!

1:12:08.166 --> 1:12:10.583
This'll keep you in wafers and wine.

1:12:10.666 --> 1:12:13.916
Eh, my school and my partners thank you.

1:12:16.125 --> 1:12:19.000
Ah, and bless you, my child.

1:12:19.083 --> 1:12:21.250
F-Father Bests!

1:12:21.333 --> 1:12:22.500
Toodle-oo!

1:12:22.583 --> 1:12:23.916
Siobhan!

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.750
Come join the celebration!

1:12:25.833 --> 1:12:27.791
We've finally won the vote!

1:12:28.541 --> 1:12:29.500
Uh…

1:12:29.583 --> 1:12:33.250
Mummy, Daddy,
I know the truth about your prisons.

1:12:33.333 --> 1:12:35.041
And what is that, Siobhan?

1:12:35.125 --> 1:12:38.875
Well, you make a pile of money
for every prisoner you take.

1:12:38.958 --> 1:12:42.750
So you pack them in like sardines,
provide crap food, crap medical,

1:12:42.833 --> 1:12:45.541
dangerous conditions,
and zero rehabilitation.

1:12:47.375 --> 1:12:49.708
I am proud of you, dear.

1:12:49.791 --> 1:12:52.916
That's our business model, exactly.

1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.125
Don't some people deserve
a second chance? Like Kay-Kay?

1:12:56.208 --> 1:12:59.916
Oh, we love those Break the Cycle kids.

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.625
Going to bus them in
by the hundreds to your school.

1:13:02.708 --> 1:13:06.541
Then, we make it impossible
for them to succeed there.

1:13:06.625 --> 1:13:07.958
And when they fail…

1:13:08.041 --> 1:13:12.541
Our new prison will be waiting
with open arms.

1:13:16.333 --> 1:13:19.958
You're really going to do it, aren't you?
Demolish Rust Bank?

1:13:20.041 --> 1:13:21.500
First thing tomorrow!

1:13:21.583 --> 1:13:24.916
The governor's coming, the press.
Everybody will be there.

1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.875
-Promise you'll be there, Siobhan.

1:13:26.958 --> 1:13:27.958
All smiles?

1:13:28.041 --> 1:13:30.166
Uh, I have to go now.

1:13:30.250 --> 1:13:32.125
I-- I have to feed Gabby.

1:13:32.208 --> 1:13:34.583
I want my promise!

1:13:34.666 --> 1:13:38.625
Oh,
I'll be there, Mummy. I promise.

1:13:38.708 --> 1:13:40.375
That's my girl!

1:13:43.916 --> 1:13:47.833
Kat, your memories
are what fuels the fever.

1:13:48.333 --> 1:13:50.208
My memories?

1:13:50.708 --> 1:13:51.541
Yes.

1:13:52.375 --> 1:13:54.333
Time to face your past.

1:13:55.291 --> 1:13:56.125
Ready?

1:13:56.625 --> 1:13:57.458
Mm-hmm.

1:14:58.291 --> 1:14:59.291
No!

1:15:18.875 --> 1:15:22.000
<i>I swear it…</i>

1:15:26.125 --> 1:15:28.666
Your memories made this monster!

1:15:35.416 --> 1:15:37.083
Ow!

1:15:43.083 --> 1:15:45.583
Make it stop, Sister Helley, please!

1:15:46.791 --> 1:15:48.708
Only you can do that, Kat.

1:15:50.416 --> 1:15:52.000
It's too strong…

1:15:52.083 --> 1:15:53.791
You are stronger!

1:15:54.291 --> 1:15:57.750
Go on now, own your memories!

1:16:04.791 --> 1:16:08.250
You've tortured me for years.

1:16:09.625 --> 1:16:12.375
But you made me a survivor!

1:16:13.875 --> 1:16:15.583
And crazy powerful!

1:16:32.708 --> 1:16:34.916
I'm in control of my life now!

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:39.375
Not you!

1:16:41.875 --> 1:16:43.500
Kat!

1:16:45.250 --> 1:16:47.000
Partners! Look!

1:16:48.041 --> 1:16:49.041
We're rich!

1:16:50.541 --> 1:16:53.208
Come on, what's wrong, huh?

1:16:53.291 --> 1:16:56.750
We saved RBC and the faire!

1:16:56.833 --> 1:17:00.166
Can't keep that money.

1:17:00.250 --> 1:17:02.291
-Why not?
-Um…

1:17:02.375 --> 1:17:05.458
Raisin' the dead didn't stop
with the old guard.

1:17:05.541 --> 1:17:08.291
You-- You raised Kat's parents?

1:17:08.375 --> 1:17:09.708
Wasn't us.

1:17:09.791 --> 1:17:11.791
Was our ungrateful gravedigger!

1:17:11.875 --> 1:17:14.541
Him?! Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1:17:16.458 --> 1:17:19.250
Yes! Hitch up the wagon!

1:17:19.333 --> 1:17:22.291
-So what's the game plan, Padre?

1:17:22.375 --> 1:17:25.916
Ding-Dong Ditch… with a twist!

1:17:27.541 --> 1:17:31.541
Kat! Kat!

1:17:58.458 --> 1:17:59.583
You did it.

1:18:00.958 --> 1:18:01.958
And now…

1:18:03.875 --> 1:18:04.916
…your power.

1:18:08.041 --> 1:18:09.125
<i>Touched it.</i>

1:18:16.708 --> 1:18:18.916
I-- I can see the future.

1:18:23.291 --> 1:18:24.250
Oh, no.

1:18:26.208 --> 1:18:29.375
-Helley's in trouble! Open up!

1:18:31.208 --> 1:18:34.541
I'm coming for you, boys.

1:18:44.333 --> 1:18:46.375
-Soul Jockeys!

1:18:47.875 --> 1:18:49.708
Yah!

1:19:01.833 --> 1:19:04.083
-It's Kat!

1:19:07.625 --> 1:19:09.000
Almost there, Kat.

1:19:10.833 --> 1:19:11.875
Hey, baby!

1:19:13.375 --> 1:19:15.250
-Hey! You!

1:19:16.041 --> 1:19:18.416
-What's goin' on?
-Oh, no, oh, my!

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:20.125
I can see your hat.

1:19:20.208 --> 1:19:21.458
-Ding-dong!
-Gotcha!

1:19:21.541 --> 1:19:22.500
Who are you?

1:19:43.791 --> 1:19:44.958
Sister Helley.

1:19:49.291 --> 1:19:52.083
She passed out, cracked her head.

1:19:52.166 --> 1:19:53.000
Oh!

1:19:56.250 --> 1:19:57.416
Talk to me, Helley.

1:19:59.666 --> 1:20:01.583
You don't get to smack me.

1:20:01.666 --> 1:20:04.333
You're alive!

1:20:04.416 --> 1:20:05.291
Barely.

1:20:05.791 --> 1:20:06.750
What about Kat?

1:20:11.625 --> 1:20:13.083
Hmm.

1:20:13.916 --> 1:20:16.958
Good. You broke the fever, Helley.

1:20:17.041 --> 1:20:18.458
She is clear.

1:20:18.541 --> 1:20:22.291
Thank you so much, Sister Helley!

1:20:22.375 --> 1:20:23.333
We made it.

1:20:25.041 --> 1:20:27.375
This-- This new power…

1:20:28.041 --> 1:20:31.125
It'll be unpredictable
at first, but then--

1:20:31.208 --> 1:20:34.375
-Thank God, Kat! I've been looking all--

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:37.416
More demons?

1:20:37.500 --> 1:20:40.000
I collect them.

1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:43.125
-Why are you here, Raúl?
-Your parents, Kat.

1:20:43.208 --> 1:20:45.875
They're gonna put them back
in the ground. I just know it!

1:20:45.958 --> 1:20:48.500
I'm going to kill Wendell and Wild!

1:20:48.583 --> 1:20:52.208
With two Hell Maidens, we cannot fail!

1:20:52.291 --> 1:20:56.250
Go ahead, Manberg.
This Maiden needs a moment.

1:20:56.333 --> 1:20:59.750
Fine, but don't be long.

1:21:06.250 --> 1:21:09.416
-Kay-Kay? It's me, Siobhan.

1:21:10.041 --> 1:21:11.375
And your biggest fan!

1:21:15.291 --> 1:21:18.125
Fine. I-- I deserve the silent treatment.

1:21:18.708 --> 1:21:20.208
But there's an emergency.

1:21:27.125 --> 1:21:27.958
Kat?

1:21:30.541 --> 1:21:32.708
-Bad goat, Gabby! Put that down!

1:21:33.291 --> 1:21:35.375
Gabby, stop! Where are you going?

1:21:37.958 --> 1:21:40.125
-Gabby!

1:21:43.625 --> 1:21:46.500
Hey, aren't you forgetting something?

1:21:46.583 --> 1:21:48.208
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1:21:48.875 --> 1:21:51.291
-Huh?

1:21:51.375 --> 1:21:53.791
So, any last words?

1:21:54.416 --> 1:21:56.958
Huh. I thought you'd be taller.

1:21:57.458 --> 1:21:59.458
I am taller.

1:21:59.541 --> 1:22:02.416
Are those cartoon mallets?

1:22:02.500 --> 1:22:05.250
What? Cartoon mallets?!

1:22:05.333 --> 1:22:06.375
Padre!

1:22:06.458 --> 1:22:10.125
Ah, yes. May the Lord look kindly on you

1:22:10.208 --> 1:22:13.875
and give you everlasting peace.

1:22:17.291 --> 1:22:18.333
-Ow!

1:22:18.416 --> 1:22:21.083
-All right, here it comes!
-One, two…

1:22:21.166 --> 1:22:22.541
-Boom!
-Ow!

1:22:22.625 --> 1:22:25.833
-Kat was scarier when she was three.

1:22:25.916 --> 1:22:28.166
And I'm way scarier now!

1:22:28.250 --> 1:22:30.083
-Hell Maiden!
-You're alive!

1:22:30.166 --> 1:22:32.000
Let my parents go!

1:22:32.083 --> 1:22:34.666
It's, um--
N-No can do, Hell Maiden. You see…

1:22:34.750 --> 1:22:37.750
Uh, you s-- What--
You still got 800 tasks to complete.

1:22:37.833 --> 1:22:39.875
That is right. So, as your masters,

1:22:39.958 --> 1:22:42.875
we order you to turn around and, uh…

1:22:44.750 --> 1:22:47.000
Pfft! You're trippin'!

1:22:47.875 --> 1:22:50.083
I'm not your puppet anymore.

1:22:50.166 --> 1:22:51.166
Dang right!

1:22:55.458 --> 1:22:58.666
-Spark Plug!
-Help, Sparky!

1:22:58.750 --> 1:23:00.125
You disappoint me, Father.

1:23:00.208 --> 1:23:01.958
Oh. Oh, no.

1:23:02.875 --> 1:23:03.916
Kat.

1:23:08.708 --> 1:23:10.041
Why'd you do it?

1:23:10.125 --> 1:23:12.708
Uh, they-- they--
they were just my size, and I--

1:23:12.791 --> 1:23:14.916
Not the boots, my parents!

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.166
Why were you putting them in their graves?

1:23:17.250 --> 1:23:19.333
P-Padre here said it was the only way.

1:23:19.416 --> 1:23:21.791
To save our Dream Faire.

1:23:21.875 --> 1:23:25.250
And it was the only way to save my school.

1:23:25.333 --> 1:23:26.208
What?

1:23:28.166 --> 1:23:29.208
Gabby Goat?

1:23:29.291 --> 1:23:30.666
-Hello?

1:23:31.208 --> 1:23:32.833
-What?
-Who's she?

1:23:37.708 --> 1:23:40.166
What's going on here, Kay-Kay?

1:23:40.250 --> 1:23:45.500
Well, for starters,
Sister Helley and I are Hell Maidens.

1:23:45.583 --> 1:23:48.000
And if you call me Kay-Kay one more time--

1:23:48.083 --> 1:23:51.750
O-Of course, you are a Hell Maiden, Kat.

1:23:52.500 --> 1:23:57.875
Father Bests,
my parents don't want to save your school.

1:23:57.958 --> 1:24:00.166
-Huh?
-Or build some funfair.

1:24:00.250 --> 1:24:03.041
-But they already paid us.

1:24:03.125 --> 1:24:04.375
-Ahhh!

1:24:06.750 --> 1:24:08.833
Wh-Wh-What is this?

1:24:08.916 --> 1:24:13.333
It's how they pay all Klax Korp personnel.
Worthless in the real world.

1:24:15.583 --> 1:24:17.500
I need to show you something.

1:24:22.291 --> 1:24:25.125
You were right, Kat, about my parents.

1:24:25.875 --> 1:24:27.416
Private prisons.

1:24:28.125 --> 1:24:29.375
We have to stop them.

1:24:51.250 --> 1:24:53.000
It's too late.

1:24:53.083 --> 1:24:54.416
What-- What do you mean?

1:24:54.916 --> 1:24:57.083
There's not gonna be a Rust Bank anymore!

1:24:57.166 --> 1:24:59.416
You saw the future.

1:25:04.291 --> 1:25:05.500
What's going on?

1:25:06.833 --> 1:25:07.666
Delroy?

1:25:11.208 --> 1:25:12.333
It's him!

1:25:15.458 --> 1:25:20.750
-Fee-fi-fo-fum.

1:25:20.833 --> 1:25:24.958
I smell the blood of two thieving bums!

1:25:26.916 --> 1:25:30.750
Oh, this is better than the undead army!

1:25:30.833 --> 1:25:34.833
Where's my hair cream?

1:25:35.458 --> 1:25:36.750
You stole it!

1:25:36.833 --> 1:25:38.625
Now he's gonna kill us!

1:25:38.708 --> 1:25:42.083
Everyone, down to the hearse,
and don't draw attention!

1:25:42.166 --> 1:25:43.708
-Wendell?

1:25:44.291 --> 1:25:45.333
-Wild?

1:25:45.416 --> 1:25:48.375
-I know you're up here!

1:25:49.750 --> 1:25:52.083
Now, come on, boys,

1:25:52.583 --> 1:25:54.250
I'm not going to hurt you.

1:25:59.375 --> 1:26:02.125
My greatest prize ever!

1:26:02.208 --> 1:26:04.750
-What the?!

1:26:06.583 --> 1:26:08.708
Who's messing…

1:26:11.208 --> 1:26:12.416
-Come on!
-Let's go!

1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:15.708
There you are, my thieving mutts!

1:26:15.791 --> 1:26:19.000
Scream Faire Daddy's gonna strum…

1:26:20.416 --> 1:26:21.250
your…

1:26:22.666 --> 1:26:25.333
…guts!

1:26:27.625 --> 1:26:29.416
Uh, no, you don't!

1:26:33.958 --> 1:26:35.916
-Yeah, all right, man!
-Yeah!

1:26:37.583 --> 1:26:38.541
All right!

1:26:46.166 --> 1:26:48.958
Got you!

1:27:01.500 --> 1:27:04.250
Why did you do it?

1:27:04.333 --> 1:27:07.583
Wh-Wh-Wh-What, steal your cream?

1:27:07.666 --> 1:27:09.916
Come to the Land of the Living?

1:27:10.750 --> 1:27:12.833
Well, why wouldn't we?

1:27:13.333 --> 1:27:14.458
Dad!

1:27:14.541 --> 1:27:18.750
My Scream Faire did not need
some radical new design!

1:27:20.375 --> 1:27:21.541
Does now.

1:27:24.708 --> 1:27:25.541
Oh!

1:27:26.166 --> 1:27:30.500
My cream… It's all gone!

1:27:39.416 --> 1:27:41.541
Raúl's art project.

1:27:42.875 --> 1:27:47.083
A parent… protecting their child.

1:27:47.166 --> 1:27:48.541
What we all try to do.

1:27:48.625 --> 1:27:49.750
Every parent.

1:27:50.791 --> 1:27:51.833
Not me.

1:27:52.500 --> 1:27:55.708
There were others before you
that ran away.

1:27:56.333 --> 1:27:57.666
We had siblings?

1:27:57.750 --> 1:27:59.250
"Hell with them," I said.

1:27:59.333 --> 1:28:02.166
"They'll be back,
tails between their legs."

1:28:02.250 --> 1:28:04.250
But they never came home.

1:28:04.791 --> 1:28:06.250
Hello, up there!

1:28:06.333 --> 1:28:08.666
Demon Lord!

1:28:09.666 --> 1:28:11.333
It's Buffalo Belzer.

1:28:11.416 --> 1:28:15.625
Fine, Mr. Belzer.
I, Manberg the Merciless,

1:28:15.708 --> 1:28:18.583
am a sworn enemy of demons,

1:28:18.666 --> 1:28:20.666
but not of families.

1:28:22.250 --> 1:28:24.250
Is that you, Belissa?

1:28:24.333 --> 1:28:27.500
I have all your missing children.

1:28:27.583 --> 1:28:28.750
Go on.

1:28:28.833 --> 1:28:31.750
Let my friends go, and they're yours.

1:28:32.500 --> 1:28:35.958
I accept, Manberg the Merciful.

1:28:36.041 --> 1:28:37.375
"Merci-less"!

1:28:41.625 --> 1:28:45.458
Gnasher, Wincer, Heddie.

1:28:45.541 --> 1:28:47.541
Look at you, Zostril!

1:28:49.541 --> 1:28:51.333
Let me tell you,

1:28:51.416 --> 1:28:56.500
uh, reports of my death
were greatly exaggerated…

1:28:57.666 --> 1:28:58.625
He dead again?

1:28:59.166 --> 1:29:00.791
Gave him plenty of cream.

1:29:00.875 --> 1:29:04.666
Dang, you raised him
from the dead with hair cream?

1:29:04.750 --> 1:29:07.083
Well… yes.

1:29:07.166 --> 1:29:10.875
Come on, boys, that stuff just don't last.

1:29:11.708 --> 1:29:13.458
"Stuff don't last"?

1:29:13.541 --> 1:29:15.666
-Don't be long, sons.

1:29:15.750 --> 1:29:19.041
Can't build a new faire
without the designers.

1:29:19.125 --> 1:29:21.375
-You mean us?
-We'll make you proud, Pop!

1:29:21.958 --> 1:29:23.000
That's right!

1:29:27.583 --> 1:29:31.083
"Stuff don't last"?
What about my parents?!

1:29:31.166 --> 1:29:34.541
No, a-a-all that's required
is a-- a fresh dose of cream.

1:29:34.625 --> 1:29:35.625
Worked for Padre.

1:29:35.708 --> 1:29:36.916
It's empty!

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.666
-Squeeze it right, be enough for days.
-Weeks!

1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:44.500
Hmm. Now we have loved
every single second with you, baby,

1:29:44.583 --> 1:29:45.958
but Rust Bank's in trouble.

1:29:46.041 --> 1:29:51.041
What if that last bit
of magic could help save our town?

1:29:51.125 --> 1:29:53.791
I already told you it's too late!

1:29:53.875 --> 1:29:57.166
No, Kat, you <i>can </i>change that future.

1:29:58.000 --> 1:29:58.958
Really?

1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:04.416
My mother thinks the fire was on purpose.

1:30:05.333 --> 1:30:06.875
Needs a witness to prove it.

1:30:08.291 --> 1:30:11.166
Raúl, raise a dead brew worker.

1:30:11.250 --> 1:30:13.416
Oh, a witness.

1:30:14.291 --> 1:30:16.791
If you squeeze it right,
be enough for two.

1:30:16.875 --> 1:30:18.000
Three witnesses!

1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:22.458
Meanwhile, we're gonna protect
Rust Bank 'til he gets back.

1:30:22.541 --> 1:30:23.916
That's it, Kat!

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.083
Everyone, ready to hold that line?

1:30:26.166 --> 1:30:27.291
-Let's do this!

1:30:27.375 --> 1:30:28.458
Oh, yeah!

1:30:29.833 --> 1:30:33.916
Down with Klax Korp!
Down with Klax Korp!

1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:35.958
Down with Klax Korp!

1:30:36.041 --> 1:30:38.083
Down with Klax Korp!

1:30:38.166 --> 1:30:42.250
But Lane,
Siobhan promised Mummy she'd come!

1:30:42.333 --> 1:30:46.375
We have to start, Irmgard.
Governor Bribes.

1:30:46.458 --> 1:30:48.458
No more Klax Korp!

1:30:48.541 --> 1:30:50.333
No more Klax Korp!

1:30:50.416 --> 1:30:52.541
-No more Klax Korp!

1:30:52.625 --> 1:30:54.166
Good morning, voters!

1:30:54.250 --> 1:30:55.791
Today, it's out with the old

1:30:55.875 --> 1:30:59.833
and in with the newest,
biggest construction project

1:30:59.916 --> 1:31:01.625
in our state's history!

1:31:03.500 --> 1:31:08.833
Now, my partners in crime,
Lane and Irmgard Klaxon!

1:31:08.916 --> 1:31:11.000
-Thank you. Thank you.

1:31:11.083 --> 1:31:12.458
No need, thank you.

1:31:12.541 --> 1:31:16.958
When your governor offered us
millions to build our prison here,

1:31:17.041 --> 1:31:19.291
we fell in love with Rust Bank.

1:31:19.375 --> 1:31:23.166
A love sorely tested by that lot!

1:31:23.250 --> 1:31:25.666
-We blocked you every year!

1:31:25.750 --> 1:31:27.833
Should I do the honors, Irmgard?

1:31:27.916 --> 1:31:30.250
-Don't mind if I do.

1:31:30.333 --> 1:31:33.750
Gentlemen, start your engines!

1:31:39.750 --> 1:31:43.250
And it's ready, steady--

1:31:43.333 --> 1:31:45.083
Wait! Look!

1:31:56.333 --> 1:31:59.541
Dear God, Siobhan's been brainwashed!

1:32:02.166 --> 1:32:05.625
Go! Go! Go! Crush them all!

1:32:09.291 --> 1:32:10.375
Let's go!

1:32:10.458 --> 1:32:12.208
That future ain't gonna happen!

1:32:54.958 --> 1:32:56.041
My bear!

1:33:35.750 --> 1:33:36.791
Your parents!

1:33:54.791 --> 1:33:56.500
-Wendell, look!

1:34:00.083 --> 1:34:02.583
Good old Soul Jockeys.

1:34:02.666 --> 1:34:04.416
Dad must've sent them.

1:34:15.666 --> 1:34:17.583
Lane and Irmgard Klaxon,

1:34:17.666 --> 1:34:19.625
you're under arrest
for arson and homicide.

1:34:19.708 --> 1:34:21.666
What?! That's preposterous!

1:34:21.750 --> 1:34:24.958
Can't prove a bloody thing
without witnesses!

1:34:28.166 --> 1:34:30.875
Officers, your witnesses.

1:34:30.958 --> 1:34:33.083
Wait, wait! It was all <i>her</i> doing!

1:34:33.166 --> 1:34:36.791
-My wife's the murderer, not me!
-How dare you, Lane?!

1:34:45.166 --> 1:34:48.875
Good news, everyone!
Klax Korp is finished!

1:34:48.958 --> 1:34:50.375
-You did it!

1:34:50.458 --> 1:34:52.416
We did it!

1:34:53.583 --> 1:34:54.916
Victory!

1:35:03.500 --> 1:35:05.916
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

1:35:07.375 --> 1:35:08.625
Poor Hell Maiden.

1:35:08.708 --> 1:35:10.708
Cream lost its magic.

1:35:11.708 --> 1:35:13.208
Mom, Dad…

1:35:14.875 --> 1:35:15.875
Tell us…

1:35:16.458 --> 1:35:19.625
Tell us about Rust Bank, Kat,
in the future.

1:35:19.708 --> 1:35:20.916
What-- What do you see?

1:35:23.375 --> 1:35:26.166
Hold tight, and close your eyes.

1:35:33.041 --> 1:35:35.041
<i>Rust Bank's comin' back to life.</i>

1:35:44.708 --> 1:35:45.875
<i>Folks comin' home.</i>

1:35:54.041 --> 1:35:56.250
<i>I'm doin' stuff with Sister Helley</i>

1:35:57.500 --> 1:35:58.541
<i>and Ms. Hunter.</i>

1:36:09.583 --> 1:36:12.833
So proud of you, baby.

1:36:12.916 --> 1:36:17.458
-How much do we love her, Delroy?
-So, so, so much.

1:36:23.250 --> 1:36:24.500
I love you too.

1:36:28.125 --> 1:36:31.083
You know, once our Dream Faire gets built…

1:36:31.166 --> 1:36:35.791
It's gonna be about the best afterlife,
upstairs or down.

1:36:36.458 --> 1:36:37.500
What do you mean?

1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:39.458
Your parents!

1:36:39.541 --> 1:36:42.791
Yeah, get them an all-inclusive VIP pass!

1:36:42.875 --> 1:36:44.333
That's ridiculous.

1:36:44.416 --> 1:36:46.666
Well, now, hold on.
J-J-Just-- Just check it out.

1:36:46.750 --> 1:36:49.083
Wow!

1:37:00.083 --> 1:37:00.958
Wow!

1:37:11.458 --> 1:37:13.000
Holy moly!

1:37:13.083 --> 1:37:15.500
Oh, my gosh!

1:37:19.666 --> 1:37:22.791
<i>I was supposed to hate myself</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

1:37:22.875 --> 1:37:26.791
Mom, Dad, I… What do you think?

1:37:27.333 --> 1:37:29.125
<i>But now, I don't have to.</i>

1:37:29.625 --> 1:37:32.625
<i>I'm a Hell Maiden with amazing friends.</i>

1:37:33.750 --> 1:37:36.083
<i>Even you, Wendell and Wild.</i>

1:43:53.958 --> 1:43:55.166
Hi, guys.

1:43:55.250 --> 1:43:58.166
It's pretty late.
It's 3:30 in the morning.

1:43:59.083 --> 1:44:03.541
And I just woke up
because I heard some noises next door,

1:44:03.625 --> 1:44:07.000
in the room next door,
and you won't believe what-- what I found.

1:44:07.708 --> 1:44:08.750
Come with me.

1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:13.041
So…

1:44:16.541 --> 1:44:18.458
I'm going to open the door now.

1:44:18.541 --> 1:44:19.458
Shh.

1:44:28.541 --> 1:44:29.500
Hello.

1:44:30.083 --> 1:44:31.625
Hey, where are you hiding?

1:44:34.250 --> 1:44:35.291
Come on.

1:44:35.375 --> 1:44:37.208
Ah, here you are.

1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:39.458
Hi, Kat. How are you?

1:44:40.416 --> 1:44:41.833
What are you doing here?

1:44:43.750 --> 1:44:46.625
Maybe she was getting bored
at the studio, alone.
