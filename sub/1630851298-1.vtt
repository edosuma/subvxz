00:39.560 --> 00:41.350
Stand still. Eyes to the floor.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.480
Walk on.

00:47.690 --> 00:52.350
TEMPORARY DETENTION CENTER
MINISTRY FOR STATE SECURITY

00:52.520 --> 00:54.400
Address him as Captain!

00:56.810 --> 00:58.350
Enter.

01:00.350 --> 01:01.810
Sit down.

01:04.940 --> 01:07.690
Hands under your thighs, palms down.

01:13.810 --> 01:15.690
What do you have to tell us?

01:16.520 --> 01:18.480
I've done nothing.

01:20.190 --> 01:21.230
I know nothing.

01:21.770 --> 01:24.270
You've done nothing, know nothing...

01:25.440 --> 01:29.480
You think we imprison people on a whim?

01:29.600 --> 01:31.440
No...

01:31.690 --> 01:34.020
If you think our humanistic system
capable of such a thing,

01:34.150 --> 01:37.310
that alone would justify your arrest.

01:39.690 --> 01:43.730
We'd like to jog your memory, prisoner no. 227.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.400
On September 28th, Dieter Pirmasens,

01:46.400 --> 01:50.100
your friend and neighbor, fled to the West.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.020
We believe that he had help.

01:53.190 --> 01:54.600
I know nothing.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.730
He didn't even tell me he wanted to leave.

01:57.850 --> 01:59.770
I first heard about it at work.

02:00.310 --> 02:04.480
Please recount what you did on September 28th.

02:05.020 --> 02:08.770
- It's in my statement.
- Tell me again.

02:09.850 --> 02:13.270
I was at Treptow Park memorial with my children.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.270
Where I met my old friend Max Kirchner.

02:16.440 --> 02:20.310
We went to his place
and listened to music until late.

02:21.060 --> 02:24.270
He has a telephone,
you can call him to confirm this.

02:24.690 --> 02:26.690
I can give you the number.

02:28.230 --> 02:30.600
The enemies of our state are arrogant.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.600
Remember that.

02:32.690 --> 02:36.400
It takes patience. About 40 hours worth.

02:33.220 --> 02:37.140
STASI COLLEGE, POTSDAM-EICHE

02:36.940 --> 02:38.980
Fast forward...

02:40.730 --> 02:42.480
I want to sleep.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.940
Please, let me sleep!

02:47.730 --> 02:49.520
Hands under your thighs.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.770
Tell me again
what you did on September 28th.

02:57.520 --> 03:03.000
Please, just one hour,

03:03.000 --> 03:03.000
Just a little... a little sleep.

03:03.150 --> 03:06.310
Tell me again what you did on that day.

03:12.270 --> 03:14.520
Why keep him awake for so long?

03:14.600 --> 03:17.520
It's... inhuman.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.690
An innocent prisoner
will become more angry by the hour,

03:27.940 --> 03:29.810
due to the injustice suffered.

03:30.020 --> 03:32.560
He will shout and rage.

03:33.150 --> 03:37.350
A guilty prisoner
becomes more calm and quiet...

03:37.480 --> 03:39.230
Or he cries.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.770
He knows he's there for a reason.

03:41.900 --> 03:45.150
The best way to establish guilt or innocence

03:45.230 --> 03:48.020
is non-stop interrogation.

03:48.150 --> 03:50.600
...school friend Max Kirchner.

03:51.730 --> 03:54.020
We went to his place...

03:55.730 --> 03:59.350
and listened to music until late.

04:01.270 --> 04:06.350
He has a telephone,
you can call him to confirm this.

04:08.650 --> 04:11.400
Do you notice anything about his statement?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.480
It's the same as at the beginning.

04:14.980 --> 04:18.560
Exactly the same. Word for word.

04:18.940 --> 04:21.940
People who tell the truth
can re-formulate things,

04:22.060 --> 04:23.100
and they do.

04:24.060 --> 04:27.150
A liar has prepared sentences,
which he falls back on

04:27.150 --> 04:29.690
when under pressure.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.060
227 is lying.

04:33.190 --> 04:38.230
We have two important indicators,
and can increase the intensity.

04:38.850 --> 04:41.600
If you don't give names,

04:41.650 --> 04:43.850
We'll have to arrest your wife.

04:45.770 --> 04:48.810
Jan and Nadja
will be put into state care.

04:49.060 --> 04:50.600
Is that what you want?

04:56.480 --> 04:58.900
Who was the person who helped him flee?

05:00.560 --> 05:02.730
- Glaske...
- Again! Speak clearly!

05:04.850 --> 05:08.020
Glaske... Werner Glaske.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.190
Werner... Glaske.

05:14.310 --> 05:16.350
Quiet!

05:17.690 --> 05:18.980
Quiet!

05:19.400 --> 05:20.770
Listen!

05:25.940 --> 05:27.650
Does anyone know what that is?

05:34.310 --> 05:37.230
It's the odor sample for the dogs.

05:37.350 --> 05:42.190
It must be collected at every
interrogation. Never forget it!

05:47.230 --> 05:50.980
Your subjects are enemies of Socialism.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.850
Never forget that! Goodbye.

05:59.770 --> 06:01.730
That was good, really good.

06:05.310 --> 06:06.390
You remember

06:06.690 --> 06:10.850
how we sat there 20 years ago?

06:13.390 --> 06:15.890
They've offered me a professorship.

06:18.190 --> 06:23.020
Life's not about good grades, though
mine weren't that bad, thanks to you.

06:23.640 --> 06:24.980
So what's up?

06:25.350 --> 06:28.100
Why do you always think I'm scheming?

06:28.440 --> 06:31.480
- I wanted to invite you to the theater.
- The theater?

06:32.270 --> 06:35.230
I heard that Minister Hempf is going.

06:35.850 --> 06:39.270
As head of the Culture Department,
I should show my face.

06:39.890 --> 06:43.230
It starts at 7 p.m. We should get going.

06:43.640 --> 06:49.270
THE LIVES OF OTHERS

06:56.480 --> 06:59.600
Minister Hempf at one o'clock.

07:00.440 --> 07:04.560
He used to be in State Security, you know.

07:04.940 --> 07:07.730
He really cleaned up the theater scene.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.060
Georg Dreyman, the writer.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.980
An arrogant type, the kind I warn my students about.

07:23.100 --> 07:24.640
But he's loyal.

07:25.480 --> 07:28.140
If they were all like him, I'd be out of a job.

07:28.230 --> 07:32.310
He's our only non-subversive writer
who is also read in the West.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.310
He thinks the GDR is the greatest country on earth.

07:39.730 --> 07:41.350
It starts.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.770
What's wrong, my child? A new vision?

07:57.810 --> 07:59.560
Speak, Marta! Speak!

07:59.850 --> 08:00.890
Your Arthur...

08:03.140 --> 08:04.350
is dead.

08:04.850 --> 08:08.810
Arthur? Can't you be wrong, just this once?

08:08.980 --> 08:10.890
No, sister. Believe me.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.600
He fell to his death.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.730
Crushed by the mighty wheel.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.850
I see it,

08:26.560 --> 08:28.560
though I'd rather see any other horror.

08:32.059 --> 08:34.890
Why am I not spared these visions?

08:38.190 --> 08:41.480
Elena! Go home... and mourn.
I'll finish your shift.

09:23.390 --> 09:27.480
Did you like it? Dreyman's good, eh?

09:27.640 --> 09:29.440
I'd have him monitored.

09:29.560 --> 09:33.730
Monitored? All that teaching
is ruining your instincts.

09:33.810 --> 09:36.020
I could oversee it myself.

09:36.060 --> 09:39.020
He's clean, I tell you. Even Hempf likes him.

09:39.140 --> 09:41.730
We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot.

09:42.390 --> 09:44.060
I'm going down.

09:47.890 --> 09:49.560
"Faces of Love"

10:14.480 --> 10:16.600
I hear a lot about your work.

10:16.690 --> 10:18.810
They say culture's in good hands.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.690
Your name is mentioned in Party circles.

10:21.770 --> 10:24.230
We're the Party's "shield and sword".

10:24.350 --> 10:26.390
I'm aware of that at all times.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.230
What do you make of him?

10:36.270 --> 10:37.640
Of Georg Dreyman?

10:42.140 --> 10:43.940
Maybe...

10:44.810 --> 10:46.390
Maybe what?

10:49.440 --> 10:53.560
Maybe he's not as clean as he seems.

10:55.270 --> 10:59.390
Grubitz! That's why you and I are on top.

11:00.310 --> 11:02.310
Your average Stasi chump would have said,

11:02.390 --> 11:05.520
"One of our best! So loyal!" etc.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.640
But we can see more.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.520
You're heading to the very top, Grubitz.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.140
There's something fishy about him.

11:15.310 --> 11:18.480
I can feel it in my gut.

11:22.730 --> 11:25.100
Dreyman's having a party next week.

11:25.140 --> 11:28.350
Some dubious types are going, Hauser and that rabble.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.390
Try to wire the place discreetly by then.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.770
Measures A and B.

11:34.140 --> 11:36.140
Only in his rooms. Nothing conspicuous.

11:36.230 --> 11:38.690
He has powerful friends.

11:38.810 --> 11:40.520
No one is to know about this

11:40.600 --> 11:43.810
until we've found something.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.770
But if you get something on him,

11:49.850 --> 11:52.730
you'll have a good friend in the Central Committee.

11:52.850 --> 11:54.730
You understand what I'm saying?

11:57.730 --> 12:00.480
Have a nice evening, Comrade Minister.

12:21.730 --> 12:23.850
Why is he staring at us?

12:27.890 --> 12:30.060
What's he doing here, anyway?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.190
I think he's got a crush on you.

12:48.440 --> 12:54.310
I can't let the evening pass
without raising a toast to our artists.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.520
A great Socialist,
I can't recall who it was, once said:

12:58.600 --> 13:02.440
"Writers are engineers of the soul."

13:02.560 --> 13:03.940
So Georg Dreyman is

13:03.980 --> 13:06.520
one of our country's greatest engineers.

13:10.060 --> 13:13.770
- What charming bed-fellows you have.
- Paul!

13:15.560 --> 13:17.600
And to Christa-Maria Sieland,

13:17.600 --> 13:20.480
the loveliest pearl of the GDR.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.810
I believe that
nobody will contradict my opinion.

13:22.980 --> 13:25.520
Let's raise our glasses

13:25.560 --> 13:29.690
to Christa-Maria Sieland:
Three cheers to her.

13:34.060 --> 13:36.350
Someone like him doesn't even deserve
to address you.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.980
Stay with me!

13:41.100 --> 13:42.940
And now something for the soul...

13:44.640 --> 13:46.440
May I?

13:51.690 --> 13:55.350
- How did you like my speech?
- Many thanks.

13:55.850 --> 13:57.890
I liked your play too.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.560
Really, it was good.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.560
"Engineers of the soul."
That was a Stalin quote.

14:03.640 --> 14:04.850
Really?

14:06.140 --> 14:09.310
I, too, like to provoke, Mr. Hauser.

14:09.890 --> 14:13.060
But unlike you, I know how far I can go.

14:14.190 --> 14:17.060
I'm more like our dear Dreyman.

14:17.140 --> 14:19.390
He knows that the Party needs artists,

14:19.520 --> 14:21.440
but that artists need the Party even more.

14:22.020 --> 14:24.940
If you're going to talk politics,
I'll find another dance partner.

14:25.020 --> 14:27.850
- I'm willing.
- Too late!

14:32.640 --> 14:35.980
I follow our theater with interest.

14:36.020 --> 14:38.060
It used to be theater people...

14:38.140 --> 14:40.100
- Paul!
- It's okay,

14:40.140 --> 14:42.060
I've known Mr. Hauser for years.

14:42.190 --> 14:43.310
Comrade Schwalber!

14:43.940 --> 14:46.440
You did a good job tonight too.

14:46.850 --> 14:49.560
Dreyman, I'm glad you're working
with such directors.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.480
It wasn't always so.

14:54.270 --> 14:56.020
You're referring to Jerska?

14:58.390 --> 15:01.310
I think you judged him too harshly.

15:02.440 --> 15:06.190
Sure, he went too far in what he said.
Without a doubt.

15:07.270 --> 15:08.140
But

15:08.810 --> 15:13.310
put yourself in his shoes for a moment.
You, as a man of honor.

15:14.190 --> 15:17.270
He can't remove his name
from that statement.

15:19.770 --> 15:23.770
He could work for any theater in the West.

15:23.850 --> 15:25.600
But he wants to stay here.

15:25.690 --> 15:29.940
Because he believes in Socialism
and in this country.

15:30.230 --> 15:33.730
- His black-listing is...
- Black-listing?

15:34.270 --> 15:39.940
We don't do that here!
You should choose your words more carefully.

15:45.270 --> 15:47.980
Comrade Hempf, just between us:

15:49.440 --> 15:51.390
My plays are not strong enough

15:51.480 --> 15:53.020
to survive Schwalber's direction.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.850
I need Jerska,

15:55.810 --> 15:57.890
and I think you judged him too harshly.

15:57.940 --> 15:59.690
Well, I don't.

15:59.770 --> 16:02.190
But that's what we all love about your plays.

16:02.270 --> 16:04.440
Your love for mankind...

16:04.560 --> 16:06.350
your belief that people can change.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.310
Dreyman,

16:09.690 --> 16:12.480
no matter how often you say it in your plays,

16:13.390 --> 16:15.350
people do not change!

16:18.890 --> 16:20.600
How is he, by the way?

16:21.810 --> 16:24.060
He hopes that his black- ...

16:24.940 --> 16:26.940
that he can work again soon.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.270
Is he right in hoping?

16:35.310 --> 16:39.520
Of course he is.
As long as he lives, and even longer.

16:39.640 --> 16:43.390
Because as you know, Dreyman,
hope always dies last.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.560
The team will be ready
to wire the place as of tomorrow.

17:02.690 --> 17:05.099
It needs to be finished by Thursday.

17:05.230 --> 17:06.560
You should plan everything carefully.

17:06.690 --> 17:07.810
Think you can do it?

17:11.810 --> 17:12.810
Good night.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.290
...and land for chicken farmers,

18:16.900 --> 18:19.040
but used in an efficient way...

18:21.080 --> 18:24.870
The 10th Party Conference
economic policy is solid.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.200
Now more then ever, the...

18:47.210 --> 18:49.580
-I'll get in trouble if I don't go.
-With who?

18:49.620 --> 18:50.870
- My girlfriend.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.580
Girlfriend?

18:53.080 --> 18:55.460
-All right, then.
-Come on, let's play!

20:48.350 --> 20:49.890
Twenty minutes.

22:47.350 --> 22:47.980
Yes?

22:48.100 --> 22:51.230
Frau Meineke... One word of this to anyone,

22:51.350 --> 22:54.350
and Masha loses her spot at the university.

22:57.850 --> 22:59.770
Is that understood?

23:00.680 --> 23:01.770
Yes.

23:04.770 --> 23:08.640
Send Mrs. Meineke a gift for her cooperation.

23:20.810 --> 23:22.810
It must be Thursday again.

23:23.730 --> 23:27.680
Time passes so quickly...
Perhaps that's a good thing.

23:45.890 --> 23:48.520
- How are you?
- Not bad.

23:50.060 --> 23:52.180
It's not always this noisy.

23:52.850 --> 23:54.560
Only on Thursdays, I know.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.180
Yes.

24:01.230 --> 24:02.850
We missed you at the premiere.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.600
Did Schwalber do a good job?

24:08.270 --> 24:10.390
His good bits were stolen from you.

24:10.890 --> 24:12.890
That keeps my ideas alive.

24:21.390 --> 24:22.600
Don't bear it.

24:22.730 --> 24:25.100
I can't bear those fat, dressed-up people

24:25.180 --> 24:27.140
at premieres anymore.

24:29.980 --> 24:33.270
Doesn't sound like me, does it?

24:33.850 --> 24:36.680
But maybe this is the real me,

24:36.730 --> 24:38.850
not the old Jerska.

24:39.060 --> 24:42.890
He was friendly and caring, nourished by success...

24:44.850 --> 24:48.140
all thanks to the grace of the bigwigs.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.480
But I won't complain much longer.

24:55.310 --> 24:59.020
In my next life, I'll simply be an author.

24:59.060 --> 25:02.980
A happy author
who can write whenever he wants.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.560
Like you.

25:07.180 --> 25:10.270
What is a director if he can't direct?

25:11.100 --> 25:14.480
He's a projectionist without a film,

25:14.560 --> 25:16.390
a miller without corn. He is nothing.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.730
Nothing at all.

25:27.100 --> 25:32.310
Albert, the Minister was at the premiere.
Minister Hempf.

25:33.810 --> 25:36.770
I spoke to him about your blacklisting.

25:41.230 --> 25:43.060
It looks promising.

25:43.480 --> 25:48.770
He gave me hope, concrete hope. Literally.

25:50.850 --> 25:51.730
Really?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.680
That's great.

26:40.890 --> 26:43.930
Cheap Georgian wine. Chateau Jerska.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.890
So is our holy drinker coming?

26:50.060 --> 26:52.310
I forgot to ask him.

26:58.480 --> 27:01.980
You're strong and forceful.
That's how I need you.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.810
Don't let this blackness into your life.

27:04.890 --> 27:08.060
- Albert is my friend.
- And you're my boyfriend.

27:08.230 --> 27:10.350
Looks like a 50th.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.180
But I'm going to be 40, right?

27:13.310 --> 27:17.770
Don't forget, you promised
to wear a tie for your birthday.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.430
I would, but I don't have one.

27:24.770 --> 27:26.310
Bon anniversaire!

27:29.810 --> 27:31.350
A tie?

27:31.480 --> 27:33.180
You said you didn't want any books.

27:35.930 --> 27:37.980
Or can't you tie a tie,

27:38.020 --> 27:39.230
you old working-class poet?

27:39.640 --> 27:40.730
What?

27:42.230 --> 27:44.100
I was born wearing a tie!

27:44.930 --> 27:46.480
I had to "fight my way out

27:46.560 --> 27:49.230
of my middle-class fetters".

27:49.600 --> 27:53.310
Then put those fetters on again, just for me.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.270
Alright... It's no

28:05.310 --> 28:07.350
big deal to tie a tie.

28:22.600 --> 28:26.730
Frau Meineke, would you come in for a moment!

28:34.060 --> 28:37.100
Can you tie a tie?

28:41.850 --> 28:44.180
You've no idea how thankful I am.

28:49.730 --> 28:54.770
- Are you feeling unwell?
- No... I'm feeling fine.

28:55.350 --> 28:56.560
Finished?

29:01.060 --> 29:05.100
Wonderful. It's perfect.
It couldn't be better.

29:06.350 --> 29:10.140
It'll be our secret.
You can keep a secret, right?

29:10.680 --> 29:12.060
Of course.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.390
I'll be damned! And I thought you couldn't do it.

29:26.770 --> 29:29.390
You don't normally hide your talents.

29:29.600 --> 29:32.270
You've no idea of the things I can do!

29:37.140 --> 29:38.680
The first guest.

29:44.350 --> 29:47.230
Our dear neighbors locked the main door again.

29:47.310 --> 29:49.270
- Can you go?
- Yes, I'm going.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.850
Maestro! Our humble offerings.

30:18.980 --> 30:22.770
- I expressly said no books!
- But thanks.

30:25.480 --> 30:26.600
Would you like a drink?

30:26.680 --> 30:28.680
- A soda.
- Vodka for me.

30:28.770 --> 30:29.600
I'll get it.

30:40.730 --> 30:43.480
Why the hell's Albert sitting all alone?

30:43.680 --> 30:46.810
He won't talk to us.
He sent us all away.

31:01.180 --> 31:02.890
I brought you something too.

31:06.980 --> 31:11.890
- Did you really come here to read?
- It is Brecht!

31:20.560 --> 31:23.640
I feel like a fraud among these people.

31:24.100 --> 31:25.640
A fraud?

31:25.930 --> 31:29.810
Come off it, Albert!
You're losing your grip on reality.

31:31.270 --> 31:33.560
You know how we admire you,

31:33.640 --> 31:35.430
how everybody admires you.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.560
For something I did 10 years ago...

31:40.930 --> 31:43.930
and could probably never do again.

31:47.850 --> 31:50.560
My favorite director! Wait!

31:50.600 --> 31:52.140
I need to talk to you a moment.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.270
Tell me again how you got into this position.

31:54.310 --> 31:56.890
Pure talent.

31:57.730 --> 32:00.770
Of course!

32:01.310 --> 32:03.890
But what else did you have to do?

32:04.730 --> 32:07.270
Everyone knows you're with the Stasi!

32:07.350 --> 32:09.810
- What an outrageous insinuation!
- Don't forget it!

32:09.810 --> 32:11.640
- Paul!
- What?

32:12.270 --> 32:15.230
Excuse my friend, he's had too much to drink.

32:18.230 --> 32:21.310
But you know he's with the Stasi!

32:21.350 --> 32:24.020
No, Paul. I don't know that.

32:43.350 --> 32:46.770
You're such an idealist
that you're almost a bigwig.

32:46.930 --> 32:49.980
It was informers and conformists
like that who ruined Albert.

32:50.060 --> 32:52.140
Spy, betrayer!

32:52.430 --> 32:55.890
If you don't take a stand, you're not human!

32:56.060 --> 32:59.230
If you ever want to take action, call.

32:59.390 --> 33:02.140
If not, we don't have to meet again.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.890
Your friends don't have much taste.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.020
That's really unfair.

33:36.270 --> 33:40.230
Here! Look at this beautiful backscratcher.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.930
That's a salad fork!

33:43.730 --> 33:46.430
Still, it's beautiful... And look at this.

33:48.020 --> 33:51.810
I'll write my new play with this.

33:52.930 --> 33:54.980
You have no taste either!

33:56.270 --> 33:58.310
I do in some things.

34:13.480 --> 34:18.310
- It's from Jerska.
- So he did give you a book!

34:21.980 --> 34:25.310
"Sonata for a good man"

34:49.060 --> 34:53.230
11:04 p.m.
"Lazlo" and CMS unwrap presents,

34:53.350 --> 34:57.139
then presumably have intercourse.

35:00.430 --> 35:02.310
You're late.

35:02.810 --> 35:04.600
Sorry, Captain.

35:04.680 --> 35:07.730
Those red lights made me
lose all of four minutes.

35:08.230 --> 35:09.930
You know how it is.

35:18.640 --> 35:25.140
They're already at it! Unbelievable! These artists!

35:25.640 --> 35:27.230
They're always at it!

35:27.310 --> 35:30.520
That's why I prefer monitoring artists
to priests or peace activists.

35:33.810 --> 35:35.810
See you tomorrow at 11 a.m.

35:43.520 --> 35:47.640
Albert Jerska, operation "Engerling".
Systematic as usual, Wiesler.

35:47.730 --> 35:50.600
The files will be sent. Let's have lunch.

36:01.640 --> 36:05.980
The BSG Volleyball team will meet at 7:00 p.m.

36:07.140 --> 36:09.350
Did you forget? Bosses sit over there.

36:10.060 --> 36:13.100
Socialism must start somewhere.

36:18.850 --> 36:20.730
About the license plate of the car

36:20.810 --> 36:24.560
that brought Ms. Sieland home...

36:26.350 --> 36:29.270
It's Minister Hempf's car.

36:32.270 --> 36:33.310
Wiesler,

36:34.100 --> 36:38.520
we can't monitor top officials.
I removed the entry in your report.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.640
Nothing written from now on,

36:41.680 --> 36:43.890
just oral!

36:45.850 --> 36:50.390
So we're helping a Committee member
get a rival out of the way.

36:52.350 --> 36:54.390
You know what this could mean

36:54.480 --> 36:58.100
for my career. And for yours.

36:59.180 --> 37:01.770
If we find something...

37:06.770 --> 37:08.560
Is that why we joined?

37:09.890 --> 37:11.810
You remember the oath we took?

37:11.930 --> 37:14.390
"We are the Party's shield and sword."

37:14.480 --> 37:16.930
What is the Party, if not its members?

37:17.430 --> 37:20.480
And if those members
are highly influential, all the better!

37:21.480 --> 37:23.060
I've got a new one.

37:23.770 --> 37:27.270
Honecker comes into his office,

37:27.520 --> 37:30.390
opens the window, sees the sun, and says...

37:31.770 --> 37:33.560
What's wrong?

37:37.600 --> 37:40.890
Oh, excuse me... I just...

37:40.980 --> 37:43.100
No, carry on, colleague!

37:43.520 --> 37:47.730
No harm in laughing about
the Party Chairman, is there.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.230
I probably know the joke anyway.

37:53.520 --> 37:54.930
Come on, tell us!

37:56.210 --> 37:57.200
Well...

37:57.960 --> 38:01.370
Honecker...
l mean, the Comrade General Secretary

38:02.500 --> 38:05.660
sees the sun and says,
- "Good morning, dear sun!"

38:05.920 --> 38:08.370
-More like, "Good morning, dear sun!"

38:12.430 --> 38:16.520
The sun replies, "Good morning, dear Erich!"

38:16.600 --> 38:20.060
And at noon, Erich goes to the window and says,

38:20.140 --> 38:21.680
"Good day, dear sun!"

38:21.730 --> 38:24.100
The sun replies, "Good day, dear Erich!"

38:24.140 --> 38:27.560
In the evening, Erich says again,

38:27.600 --> 38:28.890
"Good evening, dear sun!"

38:28.980 --> 38:30.640
and the sun doesn't reply.

38:31.270 --> 38:32.180
"Good evening, dear sun..."

38:32.270 --> 38:35.180
"What's wrong?" he asks.

38:35.310 --> 38:36.480
And the sun replies,

38:36.560 --> 38:38.770
"Screw you, I'm in the West now!"

38:45.390 --> 38:46.640
Name?

38:47.390 --> 38:49.020
Rank? Department?

38:50.730 --> 38:52.140
Me?

38:54.350 --> 38:55.850
Stigler.

38:56.390 --> 38:59.520
2nd Lieutenant Axel Stigler. Dept. M.

38:59.980 --> 39:02.230
I don't have to tell you

39:02.310 --> 39:04.560
what this means for your career.

39:06.890 --> 39:11.480
Please, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,
I was just...

39:11.600 --> 39:15.680
You were just deriding the Party!
That's incitement,

39:16.100 --> 39:18.180
and likely just the tip of the iceberg!

39:18.930 --> 39:21.680
I will report this to the Minister's office.

39:33.560 --> 39:36.680
Just kidding! Good one, huh?

39:36.980 --> 39:40.480
But yours was good too.
I know a better one though.

39:40.930 --> 39:44.230
What's the difference between Honecker and a phone?

39:45.180 --> 39:46.350
None at all.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.850
Hang up, try again!

40:31.720 --> 40:34.810
- No, I have to get home.
- Bye.

40:43.140 --> 40:43.970
Cold?

40:47.180 --> 40:50.770
Christa, you forgot our meeting on Thursday.

40:51.930 --> 40:54.930
Or did your poet have two birthdays in a row?

40:57.720 --> 40:58.720
Come on, get in.

40:59.970 --> 41:00.810
Get in!

41:13.600 --> 41:15.890
You don't know what's good for you.

41:30.890 --> 41:32.310
Don't worry.

41:34.020 --> 41:36.100
I'm looking after you.

41:50.970 --> 41:53.390
Tell me you don't need it too.

41:54.470 --> 41:56.520
Just say so, and I'll let you go.

42:07.640 --> 42:09.270
I'm meeting someone.

42:12.140 --> 42:13.890
Where do you think we're going?

42:15.850 --> 42:20.770
I'm taking you to him!
You'll be there even quicker.

43:16.140 --> 43:18.140
Time for some bitter truths.

43:35.180 --> 43:36.020
Yes?

43:45.890 --> 43:47.350
Those idiots!

44:10.060 --> 44:12.720
Next Thursday at the Metropol.

44:14.390 --> 44:15.520
Drive!

46:35.560 --> 46:36.810
Christa?

46:38.930 --> 46:40.810
Just hold me.

47:11.810 --> 47:13.520
Good evening, comrade!

47:15.390 --> 47:18.100
You're 5 minutes late again.

48:01.640 --> 48:04.680
Evening. 11th floor, right corridor.

48:04.890 --> 48:07.020
I'm already up here.

48:11.640 --> 48:14.140
How did you get into the building?

48:14.560 --> 48:16.890
A bunch of you guys live here.

48:18.930 --> 48:21.140
I don't think I've been here before.

48:21.680 --> 48:23.270
No, I don't think you have.

48:36.640 --> 48:39.560
Well? Was that nice?

48:48.060 --> 48:51.350
- Stay awhile.
- I can't,

48:51.850 --> 48:53.890
my next customer is at half-past.

48:55.850 --> 48:57.720
I work on a schedule.

49:04.020 --> 49:07.640
At one-thirty?
You won't make it.

49:07.930 --> 49:11.310
Sure I will. Don't you worry.

49:13.100 --> 49:15.430
Book me for longer next time.

49:16.520 --> 49:17.140
Bye.

50:23.560 --> 50:27.470
Georg? Did you hear about Hauser?

50:28.390 --> 50:29.520
No, what happened?

50:29.810 --> 50:31.810
He can't get a travel permit

50:31.850 --> 50:33.390
for his lectures in the West.

50:35.890 --> 50:37.350
Are you surprised?

50:38.020 --> 50:40.890
If he acts so arrogantly,
he should expect it.

50:42.520 --> 50:45.430
Would you let him go,
if you were in their position?

50:50.020 --> 51:00.270
"CMS comes home. 'Lazlo' approves of
Hauser's foreign travel ban."

51:07.310 --> 51:09.680
Have you seen my Brecht book?

51:09.770 --> 51:11.430
- What?
- My Brecht book.

51:13.140 --> 51:14.310
I don't know where it is.

51:16.310 --> 51:18.850
Strange. I could've sworn...

51:19.930 --> 51:25.270
One day in blue-moon September,
silent under a plum tree,

51:25.680 --> 51:29.020
I held her, my silent pale love,
in my arms like a fair

51:29.100 --> 51:31.560
and lovely dream.

51:32.390 --> 51:34.770
Above us in the summer skies

51:34.890 --> 51:37.430
was a cloud that caught my eye.

51:37.770 --> 51:41.520
It was white and so high up.

51:41.640 --> 51:45.180
And when I looked up,
it was no longer there.

52:05.850 --> 52:08.390
- Yes?
- Georg? Wallner here.

52:08.810 --> 52:09.680
What's up?

52:11.470 --> 52:13.220
Georg, it's about Jerska.

52:14.020 --> 52:16.810
He hanged himself last night.

52:24.600 --> 52:26.060
Georg?

52:28.390 --> 52:30.270
I'm going to hang up, okay?

53:01.470 --> 53:04.310
"Sonata for a Good Man"

54:18.520 --> 54:22.600
You know what Lenin said
about Beethoven's 'Appassionata'.

54:25.180 --> 54:26.520
"If I keep listening to it,

54:26.560 --> 54:29.060
I won't finish the revolution."

54:33.600 --> 54:36.390
Can anyone who has heard this music,

54:37.310 --> 54:38.810
I mean truly heard it,

54:39.970 --> 54:42.600
really be a bad person?

55:16.220 --> 55:18.270
Are you really with the Stasi?

55:23.930 --> 55:26.970
Do you even know what the Stasi is?

55:27.060 --> 55:32.600
Yes. They're bad men
who put people in prison, says my dad.

55:33.720 --> 55:34.720
I see.

55:35.390 --> 55:37.350
What's the name of your...

55:41.060 --> 55:42.430
My what?

55:44.310 --> 55:46.600
Ball! What's the name of your ball?

55:46.850 --> 55:50.270
You're funny! Balls don't have names.

55:56.890 --> 55:58.890
It's all in place, Minister.

55:59.220 --> 56:01.060
The latest technology.

56:01.890 --> 56:04.350
Behind every light switch, even in the toilet.

56:04.470 --> 56:07.770
- Measure C in the hall...
- You said you'd find something!

56:07.930 --> 56:08.930
Find something!

56:10.520 --> 56:13.680
I'd advise even my worst enemy
not to disappoint me.

56:17.470 --> 56:18.810
Now get out of here!

56:27.930 --> 56:29.850
Nowack, you're to watch Christa-Maria.

56:30.020 --> 56:33.600
You'll report on every minute
that she's not with me.

56:35.680 --> 56:39.600
We revoked Hauser's travel permit
for the culture conference.

56:39.680 --> 56:43.970
Maybe that'll lead to something.
The two of them are very close.

56:45.600 --> 56:48.430
How's it going between CMS and the Minister?

56:48.600 --> 56:52.020
They're meeting tomorrow night, I think.

56:52.220 --> 56:56.270
That's good! Very good!
We have a lot to gain from this love story.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.310
Or a lot to lose.

57:00.140 --> 57:01.140
Don't forget that.

57:14.140 --> 57:16.810
I used to be afraid of just two things:

57:17.810 --> 57:20.430
Being alone, and not being able to write.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.720
Since Albert's death,
I don't care about writing

57:25.520 --> 57:27.020
or about other people.

57:28.930 --> 57:31.270
All I'm afraid of now is losing you.

57:32.930 --> 57:35.390
You needn't be afraid tonight.

57:37.220 --> 57:39.180
I'm just going out for a few hours.

57:39.350 --> 57:40.770
Where to?

57:41.470 --> 57:44.270
An old classmate's in town.

57:45.180 --> 57:46.430
Really, Christa?

57:49.100 --> 57:52.640
- Really?
- How dare you!

57:55.970 --> 57:57.430
I know.

57:59.720 --> 58:01.720
I know where you're going.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.640
And I'm asking you not to go.

58:08.140 --> 58:09.970
You don't need him.

58:10.930 --> 58:12.060
You don't need him.

58:21.560 --> 58:23.180
I know about your medication too.

58:25.640 --> 58:28.390
And how little faith you have in your talent.

58:29.850 --> 58:31.510
Have faith in me, at least.

58:34.220 --> 58:35.890
Christa-Maria.

58:36.970 --> 58:39.010
You are a great artist.

58:41.470 --> 58:45.390
I know that.
And your audience knows it too.

58:46.970 --> 58:48.640
You don't need him.

58:51.010 --> 58:52.600
You don't need him.

58:53.350 --> 58:54.680
Stay here.

58:56.100 --> 58:57.560
Don't go to him.

59:01.350 --> 59:08.600
No? Don't I need him?
Don't I need this whole system?

59:12.350 --> 59:13.930
What about you?

59:15.180 --> 59:18.220
Then you don't need it either.
Or need it even less.

59:19.760 --> 59:22.100
But you get in bed with them too.

59:22.180 --> 59:24.060
Why do you do it?

59:24.390 --> 59:26.510
Because they can destroy you too,

59:26.640 --> 59:29.640
despite your talent and your faith.

59:32.390 --> 59:36.260
Because they decide what we play,
who is to act,

59:36.310 --> 59:38.560
and who can direct.

59:41.930 --> 59:44.180
You don't want to end up like Jerska.

59:44.970 --> 59:46.720
And neither do I.

59:47.720 --> 59:49.760
That's why I'm going now.

59:50.930 --> 59:56.310
You're right about so many things,
and I want to change so much.

59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.350
But I ask you,

01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:03.930
I implore you: Don't go!

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:06.930
Well, boss, am I on time?

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:10.470
Let me guess what those two are doing...

01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:14.890
Come on, I'll take over.

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:17.890
I don't want you
to do overtime because of me.

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:30.010
"Don't go through that door."

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.100
Where's she going?

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.060
To meet an old classmate.

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.220
You'll have my detailed report tomorrow.

01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:45.930
I can manage.

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:51.510
Good night.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.430
What are you staring at?

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:57.720
Soda water.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:03.390
No, uh... Vodka.

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:05.640
Double.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.260
Another one.

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:31.510
Can I have a cognac, please?

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:25.140
Madam?

01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:28.510
Go away, I want to be alone.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.720
Ms. Sieland.

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:34.760
Do we know each other?

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.930
You don't know me, but I know you.

01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:41.720
Many people love you

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.060
for who you are.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:52.220
- Actors are never 'who they are.'
- You are.

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.220
I've seen you on stage.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:07.260
You were more who you are...

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:12.260
than you are now.

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.850
So you know what I'm like.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.060
I'm your audience.

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:29.890
- I have to go.
- Where to?

01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:34.720
I'm meeting an old classmate. I...

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:38.680
You see?
Just now you weren't being yourself.

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:41.890
No?

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:43.310
No.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.310
So you know her well,
this Christa-Maria Sieland.

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:04.600
What do you think...

01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:08.970
Would she hurt someone
who loves her above all else?

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:16.010
Would she sell herself for art?

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:18.140
For art?

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:22.060
You already have art.
That'd be a bad deal.

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.350
You are a great artist.

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.180
Don't you know that?

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:35.430
And you are a good man.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.640
"When I begin my shift, 'Lazlo' and CMS

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:19.720
are arguing about whether CMS
should meet her classmate.

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:23.890
Eventually, she leaves.
'Lazlo' seems unhappy about this.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:30.100
But after about 20 minutes, CMS returns,

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.470
to 'Lazlo's' surprise, and mine.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:38.140
He seems very happy about this.
Vigorous acts of intimacy follow.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.510
She says she'll never leave again.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:50.060
He says repeatedly: 'Now I'll have the strength,
now I'll do something.'

01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:54.510
This likely refers to writing a new stage play.

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:59.930
In recent weeks, 'Lazlo's' playwriting
had been plagued by difficulties.

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:02.850
What she means by her statement is unclear.

01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:07.390
Perhaps she intends to
take better care of his household.

01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:10.310
The rest of the night was peaceful."

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:18.010
Oh, comrade... uh... It's just because...
He's sleeping too...

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:20.100
Good report.

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:24.890
Really?

01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:45.430
I didn't know he was in such a bad way.

01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:50.850
Neither did I.

01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.510
"On One Who Made it to the Other Side:

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.720
The statistics office on Hans Beimler Street

01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:06.430
counts everything, knows everything.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.970
How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.560
How many books I read a year: 3.2.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:19.310
And how many pupils graduate
with straight A's every year: 6347.

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:22.560
But there is one thing they don't count,

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:26.430
maybe because even bureaucrats find it painful,

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.310
and that's suicides.

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:31.680
If you call Beimler Street to ask

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.510
how many people between the Elbe and the Oder,

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:37.600
between the Baltic Sea and the Ore
Mountains despair drove to their death,

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.970
our numbers oracle is silent.

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.470
But it may just note your name
for State Security...

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.560
Those grey men

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:50.430
who ensure safety in our land... and happiness.

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:55.060
In 1977, our country
stopped counting suicides.

01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:59.140
They called them 'self-murderers'.

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:03.010
But it has nothing to do with murder.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:08.100
It knows no bloodlust,
or heated passion,

01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:13.310
it knows only death, the death of all hope.

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:16.140
When we stopped counting,

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:19.680
only one country in Europe
drove more people to their death:

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.220
Hungary.

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:26.100
We came next, the land of
'Real Existing Socialism'.

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:29.260
One of the uncounted
is Albert Jerska,

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:31.100
the great director.

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:33.350
It's him I want to talk about today..."

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.810
I tried to get statistics that show...

01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:43.310
...that State Security operates more
effectively than we think!

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:44.760
I foolishly rehearsed

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:56.640
my speech for the West in here.

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:02.140
Since then, I've become very musical.

01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:06.010
We can meet at my place.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.560
"3 p.m., Pankow Memorial"

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:24.350
Well? Is this safe enough?

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:31.260
My own 'bodyguard'.

01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:34.100
I call him Rolf.
That's probably his name, too.

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:38.220
Fire away.

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:40.310
Here.

01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:52.640
You want to publish this?

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.470
In the West, with your help.

01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:04.760
Will you help? Have you told Christa?

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.060
No.

01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:08.510
I'll help you,

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:12.180
as long as you don't tell her anything.

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:13.390
What?

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:15.680
Georg, it's for her own protection.

01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:18.850
This could be right for the 'Spiegel'.

01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:20.890
I'm friends with an editor there.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.810
Gregor Hessenstein. Know him?

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:23.970
Not personally.

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:25.600
You have to meet him.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.720
But you can't publish using your real name.

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:34.930
Unless your idea of fun
is a 48-hour interrogation.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:38.060
I'm cold!

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.600
We could go to my place?

01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:44.470
There's no State Security at my place!

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.140
A friend of Margot Honecker,

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:48.760
winner of the National Award...

01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:50.510
Second class!

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:52.640
My apartment is clean, I tell you!

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.760
If only we could be sure...

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.430
I have an idea
how we can check your apartment.

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.100
You know my uncle Frank,

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.850
who visits from West Berlin every Saturday,

01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:10.390
with his big gold Mercedes.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.930
It seems a bit risky to me, Mr. Hauser.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.310
Yes, I agree with Georg.

01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:20.260
Hiding your nephew under the back seat?

01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:22.310
I'm really not sure.

01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:25.760
Come on, they won't search under the seats.

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.610
They'll look under the axles, tap the exhaust,

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:31.400
then I'll be across. Paul too.

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:36.820
The border guards aren't very bright.
You've got the wrong idea there.

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:42.950
- Which border will you cross?
- Heinrich-Heine Street.

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:44.740
Good old Henrich Heine.

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:48.110
They know me and my gold Mercedes.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.150
I'm friends with the guards.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.820
Trust me, I'll call you in 2 hours,

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.990
a Schultheiss beer in my hand,

01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:58.900
and report the news:

01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:00.650
Paul's across.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.320
No! What about Paul's Stasi man?

01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:09.610
Rolf! Rolfy, Rolfy...
He'll think that Paul's at home.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.280
Okay, I have to go.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:17.610
We wouldn't want him to suffocate, would we?

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.530
Another beer?

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.990
Border control, Heinrich-Heine Street.

01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:46.150
Who is this?

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.450
Who is this?

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:51.280
No reply.

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:58.320
Just this once, my friend.

01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:24.150
- Dreyman.
- Okay,

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.530
Paul's plan worked!

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.740
No border control at all?

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.820
No, no special checks.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.780
Those boys aren't so bad.

01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:35.860
It worked as planned.

01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:38.530
Thanks for doing this, Mr. Hauser.

01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:43.360
Forget it, it wasn't all that dangerous.

01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:45.450
- Yeah, true.
- Yeah.

01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:48.030
See you soon, and thanks a lot.

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:49.070
Bye.

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:02.030
What do we do if they ask
what we're doing together?

01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:09.860
Then... we'll say

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:15.780
We'll say we're writing a stage play together.

01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:19.400
For the GDR's 40th anniversary.

01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:21.450
Yes!

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:23.450
And it's kind of true.

01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:29.030
Who'd have thought our State Security

01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:32.150
was so incompetent?

01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:39.700
Who'd have thought they were such idiots?

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:45.320
Just you wait...

01:15:55.070 --> 01:16:08.780
"7.32 p.m. No further noteworthy incidents."

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:23.240
Hello, comrade. Listen to this here!

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:30.150
Sure, in 1967 there were many suicides.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.700
But why in 1977? You must explain.

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:35.530
You must describe
the social conditions more clearly.

01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:38.990
It should remain literature,

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:40.740
not political agitation.

01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:42.490
The text is great.

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:46.110
I just want to be sure people
understand it in the West.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.320
It'll cause a sensation either way.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.950
- That's Hauser!
- Of course it's Hauser.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.610
He's not in the West!

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.990
They're writing a play together.

01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:08.200
For the 40th anniversary.

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:11.820
It doesn't sound like a play to me.

01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:16.280
No? Then what?

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.070
I don't know... but not a play.

01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:24.240
You think a lot, Sergeant Leye.

01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:26.700
You're not an intellectual, are you?

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:29.610
Me? No... I'm not one of those.

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.110
Then don't behave like one.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.950
I chose you because you know
the equipment

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:38.650
and don't ask questions.

01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:41.610
Leave the thinking to your superiors.

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:45.070
Yes, Captain. I'll be off, then.

01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:48.490
Have a nice day...

01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:51.860
of work... I mean, I hope you enjoy your work.

01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.490
Maybe I can re-write this part.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.440
I'll send you

01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:03.240
all the material we have.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.570
Can you do it in two weeks?

01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:08.860
Then I could run it as a cover story

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.150
for the first week in March.

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:14.820
It's Christa.

01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:17.650
Georg?

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:22.780
Christa, this is Gregor Hessenstein.

01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:26.820
- Christa Sieland.
- Of course, I know that!

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.280
So, what conspiracy are you cooking up?

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.690
Hauser and I are writing a play
for the GDR's 40th anniversary.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:35.820
Together?

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:39.240
The 'Spiegel' may do an article on it.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.280
- And who'll play the lead role?
- We planned to ask you.

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.400
Christa, who would you rather play:

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.530
Lenin or his dear old mother?

01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:48.400
You can choose.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.360
I see I'm not welcome here.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.320
I'll go for a nap.

01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:03.360
Your caution is praiseworthy.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.780
The fewer people know, the better.

01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.490
The Stasi is not to be toyed with.

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.150
On that note, I brought something for you.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.940
I'd have preferred the whole pie.
I already have a typewriter.

01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:29.070
The Stasi can identify its typeface.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:30.900
If they intercepted the text at the border,

01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:32.690
for your typewriter using,

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:34.610
you'd end up in Hohenschonhausen.

01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:36.990
And that's no fun,

01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.860
as Paul can confirm, right?

01:19:40.570 --> 01:19:43.440
I'm afraid I could only get
a red ink ribbon for this model.

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:47.820
Do you mind writing it in red?

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.610
That won't be a problem.

01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:53.570
Is there somewhere you can hide it?

01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:57.900
- Yes, I'll find a place.
- Don't take it lightly.

01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:00.610
I don't want my next article to be about

01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:03.070
your disappearance!

01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:06.110
Nobody may know that this typewriter exists!

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.650
Is this apartment really safe?

01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:12.190
Yes.

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:15.860
It's the only place left in the GDR

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.940
where I can say what I want.

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:21.190
Fine, then let's drink to that!

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.610
This is the real stuff.

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:32.940
To you! To letting all of Germany
see the true face of the GDR!

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.530
Cheers. It's better than the Russian stuff!

01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:45.820
To your success!

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.280
I must see Comrade Grubitz.

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:12.280
Tomorrow at 2.30 p.m...

01:21:13.190 --> 01:21:18.360
Tell him that if he blows the cover,
we'll shut down the entire parish!

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.740
It's easy!

01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:22.860
He can call the Pope and complain!

01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:25.940
Okay, I've spent enough time on this nonsense.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.940
Wiesler, I'm glad you're here.

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:31.400
I have to show you something.

01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:38.690
"Prison Conditions for Subversive Artists
Based on Character Profile."

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:40.030
Pretty scientific, eh?

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:43.150
And look at this:

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:49.860
"Dissertation supervisor: A. Grubitz."
That's great, isn't it?

01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:54.280
I only gave him a B...

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:58.320
They shouldn't think
getting a doctorate with me is easy.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.440
But this is first-class.

01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:04.990
Did you know that there are just 5 types of artists?

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:07.570
Your guy, Dreyman,

01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:11.320
is a type 4. A "hysterical anthropocentrist."

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.320
Can't bear being alone,

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.240
always talking, needing friends.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.690
That type should never be brought to trial.

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:19.440
They thrive on that.

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.940
Temporary detention is the best way

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:24.780
to deal with them.

01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.650
Complete isolation and no set release date.

01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:29.610
No human contact the whole time,

01:22:29.690 --> 01:22:31.320
not even with the guards.

01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:33.530
Good treatment,

01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:36.110
no harassment, no abuse, no scandals...

01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:38.570
nothing they could write about later.

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:42.690
After 10 months, we release.

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.650
Suddenly.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.030
That guy won't cause us any more trouble.

01:22:47.150 --> 01:22:48.690
Know what the best part is?

01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:52.360
Most type 4s we've processed in this way

01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:56.110
never write anything again! Or paint anything,

01:22:56.150 --> 01:22:58.780
or whatever artists do...

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.610
And that without any use of force...

01:23:03.190 --> 01:23:04.610
Just like that! Kind of...

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.740
like a present.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.440
What brings you here?
Developments with Dreyman?

01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:14.740
That's why I'm here.

01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:17.940
I think the time has come...

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.820
For what?

01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:23.860
For us to slim down the operation.

01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:27.030
I don't want to run day and night shifts

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:30.190
for such an uncertain case.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.740
Uncertain, eh?

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:35.400
You don't think we'll find anything

01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:36.610
for the Minister?

01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:39.400
Maybe if we're more flexible...

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:43.490
If we watch 'Lazlo' outside his own four walls.

01:23:47.150 --> 01:23:49.240
Shall I give the case to Udo?

01:23:49.530 --> 01:23:52.240
I'd like to continue it myself.

01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:54.570
Why?

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.320
It could produce results.

01:23:58.610 --> 01:24:01.110
I just need to plan more flexibly,

01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:06.400
when I come and go, days and nights...

01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:09.400
Maybe he's up to something outside.

01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:16.360
Something doesn't feel right here.

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.570
There's something you're hiding.

01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:32.610
Alright, I'll take Udo off the case.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:36.320
I can use him for this church case.

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:38.990
Give me a request in writing.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.780
Write as a reason: "Lack of suspicious acts."

01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:48.900
And, Wiesler!

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:52.740
A piece of advice for you:

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.190
We're not at school anymore.

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:57.530
Projects aren't about grades,

01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:59.690
but success.

01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:18.860
"The state statistics office

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:21.150
counts everything, knows everything.

01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:24.190
How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.

01:25:24.690 --> 01:25:26.900
How many books I read a year: 3.2.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:35.070
And how many pupils graduate
with straight A's every year: 6347."

01:25:43.900 --> 01:26:01.150
"5 p.m. Lazlo reads the first act of
his anniversary play to Hauser and Wallner."

01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:40.820
DENTAL PRACTICE

01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:47.940
We're not writing a play, Christa.

01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:49.320
You don't have to tell me.

01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:52.690
But I want to. It's a text...

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.690
Don't tell me.

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.860
Maybe I am as unreliable as your friends say.

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:03.070
But I... I'm with you now...

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.110
No matter what.

01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:45.240
Minister Riesenhuber, author of the report,

01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:49.780
said there is no quick fix
for saving damaged forests.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.690
East-West German relations under strain.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.190
'Spiegel' magazine today published

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.740
a text by an unnamed East German author

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:03.150
about suicide in the German Democratic Republic.

01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:07.570
This follows a series of suicides by prominent

01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:10.610
East-Berlin artists, the latest being Albert Jerska.

01:29:11.150 --> 01:29:14.280
After being blacklisted for 7 years,

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:17.280
Jerska committed suicide on January 5th.

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:22.320
In 1977, the GDR ceased publishing
any data relating to suicides.

01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:26.320
That year, Hungary was the only country
in Europe with a higher suicide rate.

01:29:27.650 --> 01:29:29.280
Yes, Sir...

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.490
But we...

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:36.400
General, our man at the 'Spiegel'

01:29:36.490 --> 01:29:38.990
got us a photostat of the original.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.940
Congratulations! So who wrote it?

01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:45.030
He doesn't know, but using the typeface, we'll...

01:29:45.150 --> 01:29:47.570
You're hopeless! Get me names!

01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:50.530
I will, as soon as we get the results.

01:29:50.530 --> 01:29:52.820
If not, you'll be put against the wall.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.320
Andrea, where's the graphologist?

01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:06.780
Thus I conclude that it is a domestic
typewriter produced for export,

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:09.490
most likely a 'Kolibri' travel model,

01:30:09.610 --> 01:30:13.780
made by the VEB Groma.

01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:16.440
If the ink were black, I could be more precise.

01:30:18.570 --> 01:30:19.780
Who owns such a typewriter?

01:30:20.110 --> 01:30:22.320
There are none registered in the GDR.

01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:25.320
What does that mean?
What does Hauser use?

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.690
Paul Hauser uses a 'Valentino' typewriter,
made by Olivetti.

01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:34.280
- That model has a more horizontal...
- Yes, yes! And Wallner?

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.740
He writes on an Optima 'Elite'.

01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.070
Georg Dreyman?

01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:44.740
He writes his first drafts by hand,

01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:47.820
then types them up
on a Wanderer 'Torpedo'.

01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:49.530
He's never used anything else.

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:56.070
How big is this 'Kolibri' typewriter?

01:30:56.110 --> 01:30:59.240
It's one of the smallest available:

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.320
19.5cm x 99cm x 19.55cm.

01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:06.860
So it's as easy to smuggle as a book.

01:31:10.150 --> 01:31:11.940
Thank you. You may go.

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.440
Goodbye, comrade.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.190
"The Secret Suicide Statistics"

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:32.400
Andrea, put me through to Wiesler.

01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:44.320
"4 p.m. The group is exhausted
from so much writing."

01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:58.940
- Yes?
- Have you heard about this article?

01:31:59.570 --> 01:32:02.440
- In the 'Spiegel'? Yes.
- How so?

01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:06.940
Hauser called Dreyman
and told him about it.

01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:12.320
Wiesler, this is very important.
Both for my career and for yours.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:17.860
Did he mention who may be behind it?
Or do you have any ideas?

01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:22.860
I don't think he mentioned anything.
No... nothing at all.

01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:31.360
A 'Spiegel' editor crossed the border
using a false name on the 27th,

01:32:31.530 --> 01:32:34.440
and spent four hours here.

01:32:34.530 --> 01:32:38.190
Dept. VI followed him to Prenzlauer Berg,
then lost his trail.

01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:41.320
Did he have contact with Dreyman?

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.740
- Wouldn't I have noted it in the report?
- Yes, of course.

01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:49.320
But I smell a writer behind this text.

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.490
I'd be astonished if I'm wrong.

01:32:52.190 --> 01:32:54.110
So keep your ears open!

01:33:01.190 --> 01:33:02.490
Shit!

01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:20.440
Get in.

01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:39.110
If one of your staff deceives you,
you punish him, right?

01:33:39.190 --> 01:33:40.900
Sure, sure!

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.650
Even a woman? Right?

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:46.030
But of course!

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:52.360
Isn't everyone who serves a great man
part of his staff?

01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:54.240
You could see it like that...

01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:57.570
Indeed, you'd have to see it like that.

01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:05.110
This is where she gets her illegal medication.
Christa-Maria Sieland.

01:34:06.610 --> 01:34:09.570
You should know this, it's your department.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:14.280
It's up to you whether you ruin her or not,

01:34:15.690 --> 01:34:19.150
but I never want to see her
on a German stage again.

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.740
Now get out.

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.690
Shut the door!

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:38.150
Ms. Sieland? Please follow us.
We have some questions.

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.740
Come along.

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:03.360
So...

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:08.480
Comrade Sieland, a beautiful career you had, hm?

01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:12.650
A pity really. You were good.

01:35:13.570 --> 01:35:14.940
You were very good indeed.

01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:18.650
Just too short-lived.

01:35:19.570 --> 01:35:21.110
Do have a seat.

01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:32.610
What do actors do when they can't act anymore?

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:39.070
Please...

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.860
Isn't there anything I can do for you?

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:50.900
- For... State Security?
- It's a little late for that.

01:35:52.530 --> 01:35:54.730
I know nearly all our artists.

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:56.610
I could find out a lot.

01:35:56.690 --> 01:36:00.110
I believe you.
But it won't help you now.

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:13.780
Maybe there's something else I could do?

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.980
Something we might both find agreeable.

01:36:21.570 --> 01:36:25.690
Unfortunately,

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.070
you've made an enemy
of a very powerful man.

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.610
Therefore, I have less freedom
than would normally be the case.

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:38.110
Is there no way I can save myself?

01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:42.400
I'm sorry, madam.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.940
There is one possibility.

01:36:55.690 --> 01:37:00.780
Since you spend so much time
with writers and artists...

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.480
You don't know anything about an article
from this week's 'Spiegel', do you?

01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:09.360
An article about suicide.

01:38:03.230 --> 01:38:04.860
State Security! Open the door!

01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:14.110
Open up!

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:21.900
He's turned on the light in his study.

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.610
Go in before he destroys any evidence.

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.360
Crowbar!

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.530
I don't think that'll be necessary.

01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:36.320
- What's the matter, comrades?
- We have a warrant to search the premises.

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:37.780
Warrant is here.

01:38:39.150 --> 01:38:41.190
- What are you looking for?
- It's confidential.

01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.650
Boysen, Muller: bedroom.

01:38:44.730 --> 01:38:46.610
Greska: kitchen, bathroom, hall.

01:38:46.690 --> 01:38:49.780
Heise and Thomas: living room, study.

01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:50.690
Go!

01:39:41.150 --> 01:39:42.820
What do you burn in here?

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.480
Substandard texts.

01:39:51.730 --> 01:39:54.190
A lot of Western literature, eh?

01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:58.030
That book was a gift from Margot Honecker.

01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:04.230
- Status?
- All according to plan.

01:40:08.730 --> 01:40:13.320
We found nothing,
except Western books and newspapers.

01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:18.440
- No trace to be found!
- Did you search thoroughly?

01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:22.320
Yes, Comrade! What's our next move?

01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:31.280
- Comrade?
- Pull out your men!

01:40:33.730 --> 01:40:38.730
In the unlikely event that damage has
occurred, you may claim compensation.

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:42.070
I'm sure everything's in perfect order.

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:06.320
Yes?

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:09.730
Wiesler, I'll be expecting you
in Hohenschonhausen at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:16.570
Okay, I'll say what we're all thinking:

01:41:16.650 --> 01:41:18.440
It was Christa-Maria.

01:41:18.610 --> 01:41:20.860
The Stasi got her, and she ratted on you.

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:24.820
It wasn't her.

01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:26.820
How can you be so sure?

01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:30.610
You yourself said she wasn't home last night.

01:41:34.610 --> 01:41:36.730
She knows the hiding place.

01:41:38.150 --> 01:41:39.280
Yes, she knows.

01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:47.280
So if you're right,

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.690
and the search was due to her,

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.940
then she's our guardian angel.

01:41:57.980 --> 01:41:59.690
I'm here to see Lt. Col. Grubitz.

01:42:01.110 --> 01:42:02.480
Captain Wiesler.

01:42:03.570 --> 01:42:05.110
Interrogation room 76.

01:42:22.230 --> 01:42:24.110
Yes! Come in.

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:29.730
Sit down.

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.280
So?

01:42:41.610 --> 01:42:42.650
What was that about?

01:42:43.610 --> 01:42:45.570
You're asking me what that was about?

01:42:48.230 --> 01:42:50.190
What do you suspect Dreyman of?

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.980
He wrote the 'Spiegel' article.

01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:00.280
Who alleges that?

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.900
Come with me!

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.780
Here.

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:22.860
I don't know how you could be
so sloppy as to miss all of this!

01:43:24.690 --> 01:43:27.360
But I know you differently,
especially as an interrogator.

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.360
So I'm giving you one last chance.

01:43:31.650 --> 01:43:33.860
Bring in prisoner 662, now!

01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:40.440
Are you still on the right side?

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.860
Yes.

01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:47.730
Then don't screw it up again.

01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:14.230
Shall I restrain the prisoner?

01:44:15.150 --> 01:44:18.480
No, she's an informant now. You may go.

01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:26.610
So you're my commanding officer?

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:28.780
Write.

01:44:29.650 --> 01:44:30.730
Then command me.

01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:48.900
In another 10 hours...

01:44:50.610 --> 01:44:52.780
No, in 9 and a half,

01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:55.320
Mr. Roessing will tell the audience that

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:58.980
you, for health reasons, cannot appear.

01:45:00.610 --> 01:45:04.190
And that will be your last mention
in the acting world.

01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:07.030
Is that what you want?

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:13.070
Tell us where the evidence is hidden.

01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:16.070
There is no evidence,

01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:19.980
and no typewriter. I made it all up.

01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:22.570
I hope not.

01:45:24.190 --> 01:45:26.440
If so, we'll have to keep you here.

01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:31.690
A false statement is perjury,
which carries around 2 years in prison.

01:45:34.730 --> 01:45:36.780
Dreyman will go to prison anyway,

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.110
on account of your statement...

01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:45.150
and the material
we've already found in the apartment.

01:45:48.730 --> 01:45:51.190
Save yourself, at least.

01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:55.070
You have no idea how many people

01:45:55.110 --> 01:45:57.530
are in jail here for senseless heroics.

01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:02.820
Don't forget your audience.

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.570
"Don't forget your audience!"
He has some funny ideas!

01:46:12.110 --> 01:46:14.690
Don't forget what the state has done for you...

01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:19.110
Your whole life long.

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.780
Now you can do something for the state.

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:23.780
And it will thank you.

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.610
Tell me where the typewriter's hidden.

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:33.400
Dreyman will never find out.

01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:35.860
I'll let you go immediately,

01:46:36.650 --> 01:46:38.820
and we'll strike only after you're back with him.

01:46:40.570 --> 01:46:43.570
You'll manage to feign surprise, I'm sure.

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:47.940
And tonight you'll be back on stage.

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.980
In your element.

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:55.730
In front of your audience.

01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:07.860
Tell me where the documents are.

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.690
Where are they?

01:47:24.110 --> 01:47:26.480
They're in the apartment...

01:47:29.610 --> 01:47:31.860
Under the doorsill,

01:47:32.230 --> 01:47:37.320
between the living room and the hallway.

01:47:40.610 --> 01:47:43.150
You can remove it.

01:47:57.150 --> 01:48:00.610
Is this where you mean?
Mark the exact place with a cross.

01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:34.900
You look worn out.
Remember, you're an informant now.

01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:38.110
That means responsibilities,
like conspiracy and confidentiality,

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.940
but also privileges...

01:49:05.690 --> 01:49:07.070
Guard!

01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:09.110
Call Wiesler for me!

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:12.110
Col. Wiesler has left the premises, comrade.

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:13.980
I see!

01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:17.530
Alright. Stand down.

01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:36.320
What does a rider do when he's thrown?

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:37.980
He gets back on again.

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.280
Go inside. Sleep it off.

01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:43.610
What happened has nothing to do with the house.

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:45.980
No, but with the whole country.

01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:52.820
Christa!

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:57.650
Stop, I was at Kerschner's and they had no water.
I need a shower.

01:51:15.570 --> 01:51:18.150
You were in a hurry to get here!

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:20.480
- Operation 'Lazlo' is still in progress!
- Are they both inside?

01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:21.730
Yes.

01:51:23.190 --> 01:51:24.650
Here's today's report.

01:51:25.690 --> 01:51:29.150
The last report for Operation 'Lazlo'.

01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:52.150
Why didn't you call me?

01:51:53.150 --> 01:51:54.230
What?

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:57.030
Why didn't you call me?

01:51:58.230 --> 01:51:59.480
I was out in the country.

01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:04.030
Can you hand me the nail brush?

01:52:09.230 --> 01:52:11.980
The Stasi was here.
They searched the apartment.

01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:14.320
Who was here?

01:52:16.530 --> 01:52:18.690
State Security! Open up!

01:52:19.610 --> 01:52:20.650
Stay here.

01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:32.820
Hello, Comrade Dreyman.
I'm Lt. Col. Grubitz from State Security.

01:52:33.190 --> 01:52:36.980
I just wanted to make sure
they did a thorough job last night.

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.820
Your study? We'll start there.

01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:50.900
Men, search carefully
for notes hidden in the books.

01:53:11.110 --> 01:53:13.150
Oh, what do we have here?

01:53:16.150 --> 01:53:18.270
This doorsill doesn't look kosher to me.

01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:27.440
Could it be... a secret compartment?

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:43.480
Let her go. She's not a suspect.

01:53:59.650 --> 01:54:01.270
The actress...

01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:35.270
I was too weak.

01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:37.980
I can never put right what I've done wrong.

01:54:38.110 --> 01:54:40.520
There's nothing to put right!
You understand? Nothing.

01:54:40.610 --> 01:54:43.020
I moved the ty...

01:54:53.520 --> 01:55:01.860
Forgive me, forgive me... Forgive me, forgive me...

01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:32.570
Take your men back to headquarters.
This mission is over.

01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:52.570
I've concluded the mission, Comrade Dreyman.
We must have received an erroneous tip-off.

01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:55.070
Sorry.

01:55:57.610 --> 01:55:59.110
Come on.

01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:01.150
There's one thing you should understand, Wiesler.

01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:03.820
Your career is over.

01:57:05.190 --> 01:57:08.110
Even if you were too smart to leave any traces.

01:57:09.610 --> 01:57:13.900
You'll end up in some cellar,
steam-opening letters until you retire.

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:16.770
That means the next 20 years.

01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:19.110
20 years!

01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:21.900
That's a long time.

01:57:32.110 --> 01:57:35.520
"Mikhail Gorbachev elected as leader
of the Soviet Union's Communist Party."

01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:41.690
4 YEARS AND 7 MONTHS LATER

01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:01.440
The Wall has come down!

01:58:06.570 --> 01:58:07.820
Yes, the Wall has come down!

01:58:13.730 --> 01:58:18.270
The border guards have opened the gates.
The excitement is enormous!

01:58:18.270 --> 01:58:21.650
People are streaming out in thousands!
It's unbelievable!

01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:25.520
Dear listeners, November 9th, 1989,

01:58:25.650 --> 01:58:29.860
will go down in history!

01:58:52.150 --> 01:58:56.940
TWO YEARS LATER

01:58:59.110 --> 01:59:01.770
What's wrong, my child?

01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:04.270
Your Arthur is dead.

01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:11.520
Arthur... Can't you be wrong, just this once?

01:59:11.610 --> 01:59:14.020
I saw him this morning!

01:59:14.150 --> 01:59:17.320
No, sister. Believe me.
He fell to his death.

01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:21.770
The loyal men surround him, as you do me,

01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.110
and despite the high sun, cast

01:59:24.230 --> 01:59:28.480
seven shadows on his noble dead body.

01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:33.520
Crushed by the mighty wheel. I see it,

01:59:34.190 --> 01:59:36.610
though I'd rather see any other horror.

01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:42.110
Why am I not spared these visions?

01:59:43.650 --> 01:59:47.900
Elena! Go home and mourn.

01:59:48.650 --> 01:59:50.980
I will finish your shift.

01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:02.570
Too many memories, eh?

02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:09.690
I couldn't stay in there either.

02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:14.190
But what's this I hear?

02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:17.900
You've not written since the Wall fell?

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:20.070
That's not good.

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:24.190
After all our country invested in you.

02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:28.320
Although I understand you, Dreyman.

02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.610
What is there to write about in this new Germany?

02:00:31.570 --> 02:00:35.270
Nothing to believe in, nothing to rebel against...

02:00:39.230 --> 02:00:41.770
Life was good in our little Republic.

02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:44.940
Many people only realize that now.

02:00:45.230 --> 02:00:49.690
- There is one thing I do need to ask you.
- Whatever you want.

02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:51.650
Why was I never under surveillance?

02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:56.190
Everyone else was. Why not me?

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.270
You were under full surveillance!

02:01:05.650 --> 02:01:07.360
We knew everything about you.

02:01:08.730 --> 02:01:10.110
Full surveillance?

02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:14.940
Every inch was bugged. The full program.

02:01:16.190 --> 02:01:17.190
Impossible!

02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:22.650
Take a look behind your light switches.

02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:24.730
We knew everything.

02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:32.320
We knew that you couldn't give
our little Christa what she needed.

02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:41.270
To think that people like you
once ruled a country...

02:03:06.230 --> 02:03:09.150
RESEARCH SITE AND MEMORIAL

02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:23.070
It'll be a moment, there should be
more than one file in your case.

02:04:07.570 --> 02:04:09.940
I ordered them chronologically.

02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:12.980
Old ones at the top,
and the newer ones underneath.

02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:16.270
My respects!

02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:43.770
Operation 'Lazlo'. Operation 'Lazlo', subject:
Georg Dreyman, code-name 'Lazlo', is launched.

02:04:44.110 --> 02:04:47.650
The lead came from Minister Bruno Hempf.

02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:56.610
'Lazlo' takes delivery of a daily Western newspaper
without official permission.

02:04:56.860 --> 02:04:59.900
I suggest not taking any action

02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:03.070
so as not to arouse suspicion of surveillance.

02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:07.520
'Lazlo' and CMS unwrap presents,

02:05:07.610 --> 02:05:10.400
then presumably have intercourse.

02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:23.690
The visitor was Paul Hauser's uncle from West Berlin.

02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:27.860
They tell him about a play
that Hauser

02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:31.150
and 'Lazlo' will write
for the GDR's 40th anniversary.

02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:37.940
We expect further information on the play,

02:05:37.980 --> 02:05:40.230
a plot summary etc.

02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:43.900
Contents of act 1:

02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:46.820
Lenin is in constant danger.

02:05:47.610 --> 02:05:51.980
Despite increasing external pressure,
he sticks to his revolutionary plans.

02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:56.150
Lenin is exhausted.

02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:03.730
HGW...

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:08.900
HGW XX-7...

02:06:22.070 --> 02:06:24.360
I, Christa-Maria Sieland,

02:06:24.690 --> 02:06:29.570
freely commit myself to work unofficially
for State Security.

02:06:30.650 --> 02:06:35.070
This decision is the result of my conviction that...

02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:41.190
Georg Dreyman

02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:44.520
wrote the 'Spiegel' article
"One Who Made it to the Other Side."

02:06:45.110 --> 02:06:48.360
His accomplices were the journalist Paul Hauser...

02:06:57.190 --> 02:07:00.860
Christa Sieland was arrested on March 10th

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:04.230
for drug abuse, on Minister Hempf's indication.

02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:07.860
She was released at 1.50 p.m. on March 11th,

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:11.190
having revealed 'Lazlo's hiding place

02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:15.190
and signing up as informant 'Marta'.

02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:22.320
1.50 p.m...

02:07:24.070 --> 02:07:25.480
So when did she...

02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:28.610
After the unsuccessful house
search of March 11, 1985,

02:07:28.690 --> 02:07:33.110
and 'Marta's' fatal accident,

02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:35.360
Operation 'Lazlo' was terminated.

02:07:39.650 --> 02:07:43.820
Note: HGW's promotion ban
takes effect immediately.

02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:46.480
Transfer to Dept. M,

02:07:46.610 --> 02:07:50.770
with the recommendation not to entrust him
with missions under his sole responsibility.

02:07:53.150 --> 02:07:58.110
10:50 a.m.: Resume surveillance
outside 'Lazlo's' house.

02:08:00.650 --> 02:08:04.820
At 3.10 p.m., 'Marta' comes directly from
Hohenschonhausen to his apartment.

02:08:06.150 --> 02:08:08.900
House search and report to follow.

02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:14.360
End of Operation 'Lazlo'. HGW, 3.15 p.m.

02:08:32.730 --> 02:08:34.570
Who is HGW XX-7?

02:09:19.690 --> 02:09:21.190
Stop.

02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:14.230
Back to Hufeland Street.

02:10:39.230 --> 02:10:42.020
TWO YEARS LATER

02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:24.020
"Georg Dreyman"
"Sonata for a Good Man"

02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:39.810
"A Novel" "Dedicated to HGW XX-7, in gratitude."

02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:00.230
29,80.

02:12:01.150 --> 02:12:02.020
Shall I gift-wrap it?

02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:06.480
No, it's for me.
