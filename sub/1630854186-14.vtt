WEBVTT

00:00.453 --> 00:02.280
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:02.280 --> 00:03.640
So, once this is up and running,

00:03.640 --> 00:05.266
anyone with a computer
and a modem

00:05.266 --> 00:07.644
can have access to every grant
offered worldwide.

00:07.644 --> 00:10.146
As the kids like to say,
ka-ching!

00:10.146 --> 00:11.815
That's the sound of
a cash register,

00:11.815 --> 00:13.733
in case the onomatopoeia
was unclear.

00:13.733 --> 00:16.069
Brenda has a secret man

00:16.069 --> 00:18.697
that she is hiding
from everybody.
Really?

00:18.697 --> 00:20.365
And he might be married.

00:20.365 --> 00:21.950
Really?

00:21.950 --> 00:24.577
Look, it's not easy
seeing you talk to guys.

00:24.577 --> 00:26.162
You want to know
what's not easy?

00:26.162 --> 00:27.831
Hearing from Billy Sparks
about you and his mother

00:27.831 --> 00:30.189
hanging out
in their chicken coop.

00:30.189 --> 00:31.454
What?

00:31.454 --> 00:33.712
So you know, me and
Brenda are just friends.

00:33.712 --> 00:35.171
Okay.

00:35.171 --> 00:37.549
I'm glad we can talk
about these things.

00:37.549 --> 00:41.636
Me, too. Someday we'll talk
about Mom and Pastor Rob.

00:46.516 --> 00:49.309
Oh, remember today is
Sheldon's big

00:49.309 --> 00:52.375
database launch party,
so we're all very excited.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.152
Yeah, how excited
we talking,

00:54.152 --> 00:55.236
on a scale of one to ten?

00:55.236 --> 00:57.485
Uh, I don't know. Six?

00:57.634 --> 00:58.677
Do we have
any understanding

00:58.677 --> 01:02.097
of what
this data thing is?

01:02.097 --> 01:04.183
Not a clue.
Morning, Shelly.

01:04.183 --> 01:06.560
Hey, there's the big guy.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.353
That was about a nine.

01:08.716 --> 01:10.134
Can I get you breakfast?

01:10.134 --> 01:11.553
I don't know if I can eat.
I'm too excited.

01:11.553 --> 01:14.597
I know. We all are.
What's going on?

01:14.597 --> 01:16.266
It's your brother's big day.

01:16.266 --> 01:17.725
When isn't it?

01:17.725 --> 01:19.894
Meemaw, are you coming
to my party?

01:19.894 --> 01:21.229
I wouldn't miss it.

01:21.229 --> 01:22.355
Oh, we're gonna
leave at 4:00

01:22.355 --> 01:23.398
if you want to ride with us.

01:23.398 --> 01:24.857
No, I have
to meet you there.

01:24.857 --> 01:26.609
I got a little business
I have to take care of.

01:26.609 --> 01:28.736
Oh, if you're getting me a gift,
it's not that kind of party.

01:28.736 --> 01:31.906
Although I wouldn't say no
to a TI-81 graphing calculator.

01:31.906 --> 01:34.117
So what all's gonna happen
at this party?

01:34.117 --> 01:36.828
Well, we're gonna post to UseNet
that the database is live

01:36.828 --> 01:39.372
and then watch the monitor
as the subscribers roll in.

01:40.832 --> 01:44.085
And you're calling
that a party? Bold.

01:44.085 --> 01:46.963
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:46.963 --> 01:49.632
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

01:49.632 --> 01:52.093
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:52.093 --> 01:55.179
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:55.179 --> 01:59.475
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

02:03.396 --> 02:05.982
We still haven't settled
on a name.

02:05.982 --> 02:08.318
Well, I was thinking
maybe Alice.

02:08.318 --> 02:12.280
Alice Cooper.
That is badass. Sold.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.365
Wait, who said her last name's
gonna be Cooper?

02:14.365 --> 02:16.409
Well, that's my last name.

02:16.409 --> 02:18.119
Yeah, and mine's McAllister.

02:18.119 --> 02:20.288
Yeah, but I'm the dad.
So?

02:20.288 --> 02:22.457
I think that's just the rule.

02:22.457 --> 02:23.791
Not my rule.

02:23.791 --> 02:25.627
Well, all right.
Let's not fight about it.

02:25.627 --> 02:27.128
I'm pretty sure
she can hear us.

02:27.128 --> 02:29.964
Yeah, you're probably right.

02:29.964 --> 02:31.841
Please don't have a giant head!

02:33.176 --> 02:35.637
Thanks for doing this.

02:35.637 --> 02:38.222
Hey, you make a whole
human being in your belly,

02:38.222 --> 02:40.516
I get the crib and car seat,
we'll call it even.

02:40.516 --> 02:42.977
That is not even close to even.

02:42.977 --> 02:45.188
Well, I'm just saying,
my list is pretty long,

02:45.188 --> 02:46.522
and you only got
the one thing.

02:51.110 --> 02:55.073
Hey. I didn't know
you were working today.

02:55.073 --> 02:57.367
No, I'm not. Just stopped by
to pick up my check.

02:57.367 --> 03:00.370
Got it right here.

03:00.370 --> 03:02.205
Any plans for your day off?

03:02.205 --> 03:03.164
Nothing special.

03:03.164 --> 03:06.209
Not seeing your mystery man?

03:06.209 --> 03:07.460
Just give me my check.

03:07.460 --> 03:09.253
I don't mean to pry.

03:09.253 --> 03:12.799
It's just, your friends think
you're keeping him a secret

03:12.799 --> 03:14.133
'cause he's married.

03:14.133 --> 03:18.221
There's no mystery man.
And you're prying.

03:18.221 --> 03:19.555
Sorry.

03:22.767 --> 03:27.105
Hello? Oh, Rob! Uh...

03:27.105 --> 03:29.148
Pastor Rob.
It's Pastor Rob.

03:29.148 --> 03:30.108
I gathered.

03:30.108 --> 03:32.777
Uh, lunch would be...

03:33.611 --> 03:36.030
...fine. Yes.

03:36.030 --> 03:37.824
See you soon. Mm-hmm.

03:38.908 --> 03:40.284
Shall I pry?

03:40.284 --> 03:42.578
Uh, it's nothing.
He probably just wants

03:42.578 --> 03:44.539
to gossip
about some church drama.

03:44.539 --> 03:46.791
So here's your check.
Okay, bye.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.793
Buh-bye.

03:56.509 --> 03:59.679
Excuse me, which one of
these car seats is the best?

03:59.679 --> 04:03.433
That'd be the Evenflo
Discovery right here.

04:03.433 --> 04:04.475
Top of the line.

04:04.475 --> 04:06.269
Great.

04:06.269 --> 04:08.479
Which one's your second best?

04:08.479 --> 04:10.314
Is it a gift for someone?

04:10.314 --> 04:12.567
No, it's for me.
I'm having a kid.

04:12.567 --> 04:16.195
Mm. I tell you,
that first ride home

04:16.195 --> 04:18.573
from the hospital
with the baby in the back,

04:18.573 --> 04:20.992
scariest drive of your life.

04:20.992 --> 04:22.577
Well, I got a station wagon.

04:22.577 --> 04:24.120
It's like a tank
with a cassette player.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.080
That's good, good.
'Cause you can't believe

04:26.080 --> 04:29.751
how fragile and tiny
newborn babies are.

04:29.751 --> 04:32.420
No, I can, I can believe it.

04:32.420 --> 04:34.088
So you know about
that spot on their head

04:34.088 --> 04:35.840
that ain't even solid yet.

04:36.883 --> 04:38.718
Sure.

04:38.718 --> 04:42.555
Anyway, uh, you were interested
in the basic model.

04:42.555 --> 04:46.058
Okay, pal, I'm in sales.
I know what you're doing.

04:46.058 --> 04:49.187
So...

04:49.187 --> 04:50.646
Just give me the expensive one.

04:50.646 --> 04:52.148
Good choice.

04:55.485 --> 04:57.487
Hello?

04:57.487 --> 04:58.654
Sheldon, is Georgie there?

04:58.654 --> 05:00.490
No.
Is your mom there?

05:00.490 --> 05:02.366
No.
Are there any adults there?

05:02.366 --> 05:04.535
No. But I have an IQ of 187.

05:04.535 --> 05:06.496
I'm sure I can figure out
whatever's troubling you.

05:06.496 --> 05:08.889
My water broke.
I'm in labor.

05:09.519 --> 05:10.603
Oh, dear.

05:15.336 --> 05:17.922
Come in.

05:17.922 --> 05:20.425
All right, let's do this.

05:20.425 --> 05:21.801
Why are you wearing dish gloves?

05:21.801 --> 05:23.052
To deliver the baby.

05:23.052 --> 05:25.087
That is not happening.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.223
Good.

05:27.223 --> 05:29.767
Whew. Can I get
a glass of water?

05:29.767 --> 05:31.602
Sheldon, I need to go
to the hospital.

05:31.602 --> 05:33.187
Well, I can't drive.

05:33.187 --> 05:35.231
I do have a bike, but you'll
never fit in the wagon.

05:35.231 --> 05:37.066
I don't know how much longer
I can wait.

05:37.066 --> 05:38.443
I can call an ambulance.

05:38.443 --> 05:39.902
It's okay, I'll drive.

05:39.902 --> 05:41.112
Just come with me, okay?

05:41.112 --> 05:43.740
Okay.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.241
Oh...

05:45.241 --> 05:48.286
Does it hurt bad?
Yes!

05:48.286 --> 05:49.912
That's unfortunate.

05:49.912 --> 05:51.581
It's my understanding
it's only gonna get worse.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.293
I'll be right back.

05:56.919 --> 05:58.629
Mrs. Sparks, I need your help.

05:58.629 --> 06:00.006
What's with the gloves?

06:00.006 --> 06:02.216
So I don't get placenta
on my hands.

06:02.216 --> 06:04.594
What?

06:04.594 --> 06:06.053
Thank you.

06:06.053 --> 06:08.514
Thanks.

06:08.514 --> 06:12.101
So, I haven't seen you
around in a while.

06:12.101 --> 06:14.729
Yeah, I've been pretty busy
trying to help Pastor Jeff

06:14.729 --> 06:16.481
hold things together
at the church.

06:16.481 --> 06:18.274
Oh. Things okay?

06:18.274 --> 06:20.401
You know.

06:20.401 --> 06:22.111
Not as good as they were
when you were there.

06:22.111 --> 06:24.113
Well, that's nice
of you to say.

06:24.113 --> 06:25.823
No, I mean that it's chaos.

06:25.823 --> 06:29.118
I'm sure you'll
pull through.

06:29.118 --> 06:32.789
Yeah, actually, I got
another job offer.

06:32.789 --> 06:35.291
Oh.

06:35.291 --> 06:39.212
First Baptist in Little Rock
is looking for a youth pastor.

06:40.505 --> 06:42.965
Arkansas.

06:42.965 --> 06:44.300
That's a big move.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.968
Well, I'm not sure
I'm gonna take it yet,

06:45.968 --> 06:49.639
but, um, kind of wanted
to get your advice.

06:49.639 --> 06:53.309
So you might stay?

06:53.309 --> 06:55.478
Well, it's a good opportunity,
bigger congregation,

06:55.478 --> 06:57.396
but I'd miss the kids... Mm.

06:57.396 --> 07:01.359
and, you know,
the friends I've made.

07:01.359 --> 07:05.822
Sure. Are you still
seeing that girl?

07:05.822 --> 07:07.073
The one you babysat?

07:07.073 --> 07:09.992
Yeah, that one.

07:09.992 --> 07:12.662
Uh, no, no.

07:12.662 --> 07:14.831
We, um, we broke up.

07:14.831 --> 07:16.457
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:18.167 --> 07:22.672
So, what do you think?

07:22.672 --> 07:27.844
Well, um...

07:27.844 --> 07:30.221
I would miss

07:30.221 --> 07:33.432
having you around,

07:33.432 --> 07:38.688
but I think you need
to follow your heart.

07:41.691 --> 07:44.068
What if my heart doesn't
know what it wants?

07:44.068 --> 07:46.779
I don't know.
Pick a different organ.

07:46.779 --> 07:48.489
Mary Cooper.

07:48.489 --> 07:51.200
Oh, grow up.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.786
That's not what I meant.

07:57.373 --> 07:58.708
Shouldn't you be laying down?

07:58.708 --> 08:00.209
No, it's good to be
on my feet.

08:00.209 --> 08:01.711
The doctor said
this could take a while.

08:01.711 --> 08:03.921
Could you be more specific?

08:03.921 --> 08:05.464
I have a thing at 5:00.

08:06.966 --> 08:09.385
Is there anyone else
I can call for you?

08:09.385 --> 08:11.220
Maybe your mom?
No, I can't deal
with her right now.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.055
Maybe after they
give me drugs.

08:13.055 --> 08:14.640
Okay, I'll just keep
trying the Coopers.

08:17.727 --> 08:19.228
You know, in a way,
you and I are having

08:19.228 --> 08:20.479
a very similar day.

08:20.479 --> 08:23.399
Really? How might that be?

08:23.399 --> 08:26.027
I'm also bringing something
new into the world.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.695
Although mine does not
involve my privates

08:27.695 --> 08:29.238
being inspected my strangers.

08:45.087 --> 08:48.424
Okay. "Tighten strap
until car seat moves

08:48.424 --> 08:50.176
no more than
half an inch."

08:50.176 --> 08:52.011
Okay.

08:56.557 --> 08:58.351
Well, that's more
than half an inch.

09:05.858 --> 09:07.526
Aw, come on.

09:16.035 --> 09:18.079
♪ Come on, now, drummer ♪

09:18.079 --> 09:20.957
♪ I want you to tighten it up

09:45.648 --> 09:49.485
You've been through this before.
How long does it take?

09:49.485 --> 09:52.822
Depends. With Billy,
it was days.

09:53.906 --> 09:56.158
Well, he always has
been a tad slow.

09:57.994 --> 10:00.079
I just got your message.

10:00.079 --> 10:01.497
Am I late?
Did I miss it?

10:01.497 --> 10:02.790
Actually, you're
the first one here.

10:02.790 --> 10:04.333
Actually, I was
the first one here

10:04.333 --> 10:05.668
and I'd like to be
the first one to leave.

10:05.668 --> 10:07.336
So who's back there
with Mandy?

10:07.336 --> 10:09.714
She's with the doctor.
We gave her some privacy.

10:09.714 --> 10:11.966
Where the hell's Georgie?
We can't find him.

10:11.966 --> 10:13.551
What about Mary?
Ain't she at the bowling alley?

10:13.551 --> 10:15.720
No. Sh-She went out to lunch.

10:15.720 --> 10:18.848
And speaking of lunch,
we should get to my launch.

10:18.848 --> 10:20.516
Sheldon, my granddaughter's
about to be born.

10:20.516 --> 10:22.059
I-I'm not going anywhere.

10:22.059 --> 10:23.894
Oh, I'm sure Georgie will
get more women pregnant.

10:23.894 --> 10:24.895
You'll have another chance.

10:24.895 --> 10:26.313
Walk away.

10:31.193 --> 10:33.237
Well, I, I guess I'm gonna go.

10:33.237 --> 10:36.198
Come on, stay.
Keep me company.

10:36.198 --> 10:37.825
Fine.

10:43.456 --> 10:46.542
Remember the last time
we were here?

10:46.542 --> 10:49.670
You mean the night
you gave me a heart attack?

10:49.670 --> 10:51.338
Stop it.

10:51.338 --> 10:53.758
I did not give you
a heart attack.

10:53.758 --> 10:57.470
You gave me something. Well...

10:59.263 --> 11:00.890
Oh, hey, Mary.

11:00.890 --> 11:02.183
What's going on?

11:02.183 --> 11:03.642
Nothing. What's going on
with you?

11:03.642 --> 11:05.728
Who's with Mandy?
The doctor.

11:05.728 --> 11:08.397
What are you two
doing out here?

11:08.397 --> 11:11.609
Waiting on you.
Where have you been?

11:11.609 --> 11:13.611
I was at lunch.

11:13.611 --> 11:15.404
Hey.

11:15.404 --> 11:17.323
I hear we're having a baby.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.681
What? Did I miss it?

11:25.868 --> 11:27.704
Where is my dad?

11:27.704 --> 11:29.664
I ask that question a lot.

11:29.664 --> 11:31.082
He's not usually late.

11:31.082 --> 11:33.710
My mom's picking me up,
but she's always late.

11:35.003 --> 11:36.879
Hey. Maybe they're together.

11:36.879 --> 11:38.172
Why would they be together?

11:38.172 --> 11:39.632
They could be having
another secret meeting

11:39.632 --> 11:41.092
in the chicken coop.

11:41.092 --> 11:43.511
He's probably running
late at practice.

11:43.511 --> 11:44.846
Okay.

11:44.846 --> 11:48.349
I'm sure they're not together. Okay.

11:48.349 --> 11:50.476
I mean it. Okay.

11:50.476 --> 11:51.603
Shut up, Billy.

11:51.603 --> 11:53.563
Okay.

11:53.563 --> 11:56.107
What is he doing here?
He's a pastor,

11:56.107 --> 11:57.650
and he wanted to be here.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.694
I mean what is he
doing here with you?

11:59.694 --> 12:02.530
He asked me for some advice,
so we had lunch.

12:02.530 --> 12:04.699
So that's why no one
could find you for hours.

12:04.699 --> 12:06.200
Are you accusing me
of something?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.368
Is there something
to accuse you of?

12:07.368 --> 12:10.038
Hey, today's the
day of miracles.

12:10.038 --> 12:11.331
Do you really want
to be fighting?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.041
Stay out of this.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.709
We didn't do anything wrong.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.127
I think I'm gonna
head out.

12:16.127 --> 12:17.879
No, he's staying,
you're staying.

12:17.879 --> 12:18.880
What does that mean?

12:18.880 --> 12:20.131
Nothing, just...

12:20.548 --> 12:21.758
Nothing.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.303
What's going on
with you two?

12:25.303 --> 12:27.764
What's going
on with you two?

12:27.764 --> 12:30.975
Last chance. Who wants
to witness science history?

12:33.144 --> 12:35.063
Don't be shy, folks.

12:41.527 --> 12:44.280
You have nine new messages.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.634
Connie?
What are you doing here?

13:04.634 --> 13:06.928
I'm having a baby.

13:06.928 --> 13:08.471
Oh. It's happening?

13:08.471 --> 13:11.349
Kinda. Why are you here?

13:11.349 --> 13:15.728
Uh, I-I had a medical thing.
It-It's been handled.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.230
Here, let me help you
to your room.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.148
What kind of thing?
Just a thing.

13:19.148 --> 13:20.400
It's been tended to.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.485
How-how far apart are
your contractions?

13:22.485 --> 13:24.570
Connie, what's going on?

13:24.570 --> 13:25.822
It's hemorrhoids, okay?

13:25.822 --> 13:27.657
It's embarrassing,
but here we are.

13:27.657 --> 13:30.785
Hemorrhoids, hemorrhoids,
hemorrhoids!

13:30.785 --> 13:32.203
Happy?

13:34.872 --> 13:37.041
Well, I'm about four
centimeters dilated,

13:37.041 --> 13:38.251
and the doctors
think it could be

13:38.251 --> 13:39.252
another few hours.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.837
Well...

13:42.964 --> 13:44.882
Good.

13:44.882 --> 13:47.301
Walk slow.
Oh, okay.

13:47.301 --> 13:49.929
So, how often are you taking
my wife out to lunch?

13:49.929 --> 13:53.224
It was just lunch.
He didn't take me out.

13:53.224 --> 13:55.768
So, who's going to drive me?
'Cause time's a-tickin'.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.271
Sheldon, not now.
G-Go check on Mandy.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.274
But...
Sheldon, go!

14:01.274 --> 14:03.151
You are being ridiculous.

14:03.151 --> 14:05.194
Am I? I got eyes, Mary.

14:05.194 --> 14:07.572
So do I.
And when I walked in,

14:07.572 --> 14:09.449
you and Brenda were
acting weird.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.658
What is that about?

14:10.658 --> 14:11.909
Nothing. It's about nothing.

14:11.909 --> 14:13.703
Yeah, it's nothing.

14:13.703 --> 14:16.998
Is my husband your mystery man?

14:16.998 --> 14:20.126
No.
She's dating someone else.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.044
How do you know that?
She told me.

14:22.044 --> 14:24.964
Why are you talking
to my husband

14:24.964 --> 14:26.382
about your love life?

14:26.382 --> 14:28.259
You know, Mary, you
might want to be careful

14:28.259 --> 14:29.969
about throwing stones,

14:29.969 --> 14:31.846
'cause I've seen
your glass house.

14:31.846 --> 14:33.347
What does that mean?

14:33.347 --> 14:35.683
I saw how upset you were
when this one was on a date.

14:36.517 --> 14:39.562
Really?
What the hell
do you mean, "really"?

14:39.562 --> 14:41.481
What's going on?
Where's Mandy?

14:41.481 --> 14:43.816
Uh, she's fine.
She's in her room.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.360
So she's having
a baby by herself

14:46.360 --> 14:47.487
while you're all out here?

14:47.487 --> 14:49.697
No, Sheldon's with her.

14:49.697 --> 14:51.782
Unbelievable.

14:54.494 --> 14:55.912
George, Mary.

14:55.912 --> 14:57.663
Jim.
It's nice to see you.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.081
Hey, how are you? My name's...

14:59.081 --> 15:00.625
Jim!
Gotta go.

15:08.299 --> 15:10.301
Can't believe this.

15:11.802 --> 15:13.304
Where you going?
Home.

15:13.304 --> 15:16.057
They clearly forgot
about us.

15:16.057 --> 15:18.601
This sucks.

15:18.601 --> 15:20.019
Do you think my mom
and your dad

15:20.019 --> 15:21.938
are going to be
boyfriend and girlfriend?

15:21.938 --> 15:23.523
No.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.025
If they got married, would
that make us brother and sister?

15:26.025 --> 15:27.610
It's not gonna happen.

15:27.610 --> 15:30.363
Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia
were brother and sister,

15:30.363 --> 15:31.614
and they still kissed.

15:33.074 --> 15:34.951
I didn't write it.

15:36.410 --> 15:39.038
Excuse me, does that computer
have a modem?

15:39.038 --> 15:42.542
A what?
A modem. It's how you access
the World Wide Web.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.543
The what?

15:43.543 --> 15:45.378
It's when your computer wants

15:45.378 --> 15:46.671
to talk to another computer,

15:46.671 --> 15:49.632
and it goes...

15:55.096 --> 15:57.056
You mean a fax machine.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.267
It's like I'm from
the future.

16:06.274 --> 16:08.150
What are you doing out here?

16:08.150 --> 16:10.278
I heard Mandy was
having the baby.

16:10.278 --> 16:13.281
Yes, but that happens inside.

16:13.281 --> 16:15.449
I know.

16:16.492 --> 16:17.785
Aren't you going in?

16:17.785 --> 16:19.954
I can't.

16:19.954 --> 16:22.081
Oh, these doors are automated.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.499
You just walk towards them
and they open.

16:23.499 --> 16:25.418
I can't be a dad.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.461
I couldn't even install
a car seat.

16:27.461 --> 16:30.965
Great. You can drive me
to my launch party.

16:34.010 --> 16:35.386
you're doing great, sweetie.

16:35.386 --> 16:37.555
Didn't work 30 years ago,
doesn't work now.

16:37.555 --> 16:39.473
I think I'll just let y'all
have a little family time.

16:39.473 --> 16:40.808
Please stay.

16:40.808 --> 16:42.852
Hey.

16:42.852 --> 16:45.438
Oh, how we doing?
I'm all right.

16:46.856 --> 16:47.857
Are you all right?

16:47.857 --> 16:50.192
I'm fine. Just fine.

16:50.192 --> 16:51.944
Fine? Looked like
your husband was gonna

16:51.944 --> 16:54.655
punch out that guy
in the waiting room.
What happened?

16:54.655 --> 16:56.490
When did you get here?

16:56.490 --> 16:57.700
Earlier.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.620
So, who did George almost punch?

17:00.620 --> 17:02.955
Some little fella
with a mustache.

17:04.415 --> 17:06.959
Okay, hang in there,
baby, you're doing great.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.210
What did I just tell you?

17:08.210 --> 17:10.004
I don't know what else to say.

17:10.004 --> 17:12.006
Thank you for doing this.

17:13.007 --> 17:14.592
Mm-hmm.

17:14.592 --> 17:16.594
You know, you wait and you wait
and you wait,

17:16.594 --> 17:18.012
and you think the day's
never gonna come,

17:18.012 --> 17:20.681
and then pow, it's here.
I know.

17:20.681 --> 17:22.391
Everyone thought
I was too young,

17:22.391 --> 17:25.937
that I wouldn't see it through,
but here I am.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.607
To think I almost missed it.

17:29.607 --> 17:32.735
I would have regretted that
for the rest of my life.

17:38.282 --> 17:39.283
Why are we turning around?

17:42.119 --> 17:45.331
Hey.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.874
What's going on with you two?

17:46.874 --> 17:48.250
Nothing.
We're fine.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.669
You know what,
if you're gonna fight,

17:49.669 --> 17:51.003
can you do it out loud?

17:51.003 --> 17:52.213
'Cause I could really use
the distraction.

17:52.213 --> 17:54.090
No one's fighting.

17:55.341 --> 17:58.010
Where is that big needle?
I was promised a big needle.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.680
I think we're getting close.
Since the father's not here,

18:00.680 --> 18:02.390
I'll go in the delivery room
with you.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.352
Or I'm happy to go,
if you want.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.479
I'm not gonna be sitting down
anytime soon.

18:08.479 --> 18:09.897
Georgie will be here.

18:09.897 --> 18:12.441
If he were gonna be here,
he'd be here.

18:12.441 --> 18:14.110
But honestly,
who's surprised?

18:14.110 --> 18:16.070
Well, I'm a little surprised.

18:16.070 --> 18:17.446
Jim, not now.

18:17.446 --> 18:20.241
All right, well,
I can have my own opinion.

18:20.241 --> 18:21.575
I think he's a good kid.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.953
You never take my side.

18:23.953 --> 18:25.538
Are you kidding me?!

18:25.538 --> 18:28.416
I missed her whole pregnancy
'cause I took your side.

18:28.416 --> 18:30.876
So you're just, you're just
okay with all of this?

18:30.876 --> 18:34.088
My daughter is having a baby.
I'm thrilled.

18:34.088 --> 18:36.257
Aw, Dad.

18:37.883 --> 18:40.094
Sorry I'm late.

18:40.094 --> 18:41.595
Oh, no, no, no.
You're right on time.

18:41.595 --> 18:42.555
Told you.

18:43.431 --> 18:45.391
You are completely late, but
I'm really glad you're here.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.560
Do you want all
these people around?

18:47.560 --> 18:48.561
No!

18:48.561 --> 18:49.895
All right, everybody out.

18:49.895 --> 18:51.355
But...
Out.

18:51.355 --> 18:53.566
Uh, we'll be in the
waiting room if you need us.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.568
My advice, take all
the drugs they offer.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.652
I plan to.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.157
How you doing?
Where were you?

19:01.157 --> 19:03.576
I'm sorry. I was trying
to install the car seat,

19:03.576 --> 19:04.952
and I didn't hear the phone.

19:04.952 --> 19:06.912
It's okay, you made it.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.874
Did you get it installed?
Sheldon did.

19:09.874 --> 19:11.959
Turns out, it takes a genius.

19:20.651 --> 19:21.736
Mom, sit.

19:21.736 --> 19:24.739
No, no, I'm, I'm good.

19:25.656 --> 19:26.908
She's here.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.912
She's tiny and perfect,
and Mandy's doing great.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.751
Oh, what's her name?

19:38.169 --> 19:39.212
Constance.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.214
Oh...

19:41.214 --> 19:45.510
Yes. Thank you.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.094
Is there a middle name?

19:47.094 --> 19:49.055
We're still working on it.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.515
Can we see her?

19:50.515 --> 19:51.891
Well, they're sleeping
right now,

19:51.891 --> 19:53.100
but I'll let y'all know
when they're up.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.853
Well, we're gonna be
right here.

19:55.853 --> 19:58.731
So you're a grandma.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.025
I know.

20:01.025 --> 20:04.612
Let's get you some tissue.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.332
I'm gonna stay
at my mom's house tonight.

20:09.332 --> 20:11.751
Fine by me.

20:11.751 --> 20:13.503
I just talked to Dr. Sturgis.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.713
We didn't get
a single subscriber.

20:15.713 --> 20:19.550
My database is
a complete failure.

20:21.052 --> 20:23.096
I know, I'm upset, too.

20:23.955 --> 20:24.955
Where's Missy?
