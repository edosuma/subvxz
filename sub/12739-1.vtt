05:37.585 --> 05:39.629
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

05:39.713 --> 05:41.589
Hello?

05:41.673 --> 05:45.510
<i>(shouts) Ming!
Turn that stinking music down!</i>

05:45.593 --> 05:47.220
Oh, it's you!

05:47.304 --> 05:50.473
Where's my painting? I want my painting.

05:51.099 --> 05:54.978
In the mail? Well, that's original!

05:55.520 --> 05:59.566
I have to say, I'm astonished
that you could do it!

05:59.649 --> 06:03.570
The climb! All that schlepping
at your tender age!

06:03.653 --> 06:07.282
Anyway, bad news.
The price for the goggles went up.

06:07.365 --> 06:11.077
The Rembrandt's
not gonna cover my expenses.

06:12.370 --> 06:16.541
Under the circumstances,
40 million would be a bargain.

06:16.624 --> 06:22.881
I don't care how you get it.
Just make sure that you get it fast.

06:22.964 --> 06:26.301
Tick-tock... tick-tock.

06:39.439 --> 06:41.566
- Morning, Mr Cruz.
- Morning.

06:53.411 --> 06:59.834
First you insure the art, only to watch it
get clipped a month after the client buys it.

06:59.918 --> 07:02.962
Well, it could become
part of our ad campaign.

07:03.046 --> 07:08.843
I'll remember that when I go upstairs to hear
about my new position in the Toledo office.

07:09.219 --> 07:11.971
I called you at 4.30 this morning.

07:12.972 --> 07:15.016
I was home in bed.

07:15.099 --> 07:17.519
- You didn't pick up.
- I didn't wanna pick up.

07:17.602 --> 07:19.687
You had company.

07:20.438 --> 07:23.441
- He came in the window.
- How romantic.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.985
I think that's how he got in.

07:26.069 --> 07:30.573
This was 70 storeys up with smart-glass
windows at 400 pounds a pop.

07:30.657 --> 07:32.909
He rigged something.

07:35.036 --> 07:37.121
And I think it was...

07:38.498 --> 07:42.126
...telescoping bolts.
- And you know this how?

07:42.752 --> 07:44.837
Excuse me.

07:45.672 --> 07:48.633
<i>(woman speaks Chinese)</i>

07:48.716 --> 07:52.720
- You're showing off again.
- Let a thousand flowers bloom.

07:52.804 --> 07:55.223
- Chairman Mao.
- You got it.

07:56.641 --> 07:59.352
He left the window open when he came in.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.646
The draught blew over the flowers.

08:01.729 --> 08:05.191
I'll bet the bolts on that window
have fresh scratches.

08:05.275 --> 08:07.610
- And who do we like for this?
- Guess.

08:07.694 --> 08:09.320
Oh, gee. I wonder.

08:10.863 --> 08:12.949
Indulge me.

08:13.575 --> 08:15.577
Indulge you?

08:16.452 --> 08:19.789
- Bob, may I?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.

08:22.333 --> 08:26.045
Four weeks ago, when our client
bought the Rembrandt.

08:26.129 --> 08:28.548
- See anyone we know?
- No.

08:28.715 --> 08:31.426
No, and neither did anyone else.

08:36.597 --> 08:38.641
Now look again.

08:38.725 --> 08:42.228
You think he marked the buyer
at the auction house.

08:42.312 --> 08:44.939
- Right.
- Good work, Bob.

08:45.064 --> 08:50.862
- And let's not forget the calling card.
- Elvis has not left the building.

08:52.071 --> 08:54.032
This is classic Mac, Hector.

08:54.115 --> 08:59.329
In the five years I've known you, you've liked
MacDougal for half the cases we've worked.

08:59.412 --> 09:02.582
- He's the best.
- He's also 60 years old.

09:02.665 --> 09:07.545
He ain't Spiderman any more. He's a rich guy.
He doesn't have to steal a Rembrandt.

09:07.628 --> 09:09.922
You think he steals because he has to?

09:10.923 --> 09:13.009
Keep working.

09:33.905 --> 09:35.865
So you get in here at 7am...

09:35.948 --> 09:40.995
...you work until 10, eat lunch alone,
you have no friends at the office...

09:41.079 --> 09:45.249
- Wow, you've been paying attention.
- I'm worried about you.

09:46.209 --> 09:50.588
Maybe I like being alone.
Maybe I'm getting over someone.

09:50.671 --> 09:55.802
Well, they say nothing gets you over
the last one like the next one.

09:55.885 --> 09:59.639
Is this your way of asking me out,
Hector? Huh?

09:59.722 --> 10:02.809
Well, um... not if you're gonna say no.

10:05.895 --> 10:07.730
You may be right.

10:10.274 --> 10:14.403
- He was here this week.
- He flew back to London this morning?

10:14.487 --> 10:18.825
It might be worth sending someone
over there, see what he's up to.

10:20.993 --> 10:22.912
- I know this guy.
- Do you?

10:22.995 --> 10:23.663
Sure!

10:23.746 --> 10:28.251
Some years back, when I was at the Bureau,
we sent two guys after him.

10:28.334 --> 10:31.462
I know, I know. They disappeared.
I know the story.

10:31.546 --> 10:34.966
- And these were both good agents.
- They were both men.

10:35.049 --> 10:37.593
What do you have in mind for bait?

10:42.265 --> 10:45.726
- The one thing I know he wants.
- Why not the Mona Lisa?

10:45.810 --> 10:47.895
Our guy likes a challenge.

10:49.063 --> 10:50.690
Come on.

10:51.566 --> 10:53.526
I want this back.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.721
Thank you, sir.

12:32.583 --> 12:35.044
<i>(alarm)</i>

12:56.816 --> 12:58.651
<i>(sirens)</i>

13:20.589 --> 13:22.133

13:51.453 --> 13:52.705
Rule number one:

13:52.788 --> 13:56.458
Never carry a gun, or you
might be tempted to use it.

13:56.542 --> 13:59.128
- Why are you here?
- To ask some questions.

13:59.211 --> 14:02.798
If I don't like your answers,
you're going out the window.

14:02.882 --> 14:07.136
- Why are you following me?
- I've got a proposition for you.

14:07.219 --> 14:11.640
- How do I know that you're not a cop?
- You'll just have to trust me.

14:11.724 --> 14:14.476
Rule number two:
Never trust a naked woman.

14:14.560 --> 14:18.480
I had nothing to sleep in.
Somebody stole my luggage.

14:18.564 --> 14:20.608
Really? I'm shocked.

14:20.691 --> 14:23.986
It's amazing what gets stolen
these days. Your bags...

14:24.069 --> 14:25.404
That Rembrandt.

14:25.487 --> 14:26.697
Mm.

14:26.780 --> 14:28.741
Indeed. That Rembrandt.

14:30.117 --> 14:33.454
- And this is your proposition?
- Yep.

14:33.537 --> 14:37.291
- I don't think it's for sale.
- It's not. I'm gonna steal it.

14:37.374 --> 14:41.170
From Bedford Palace?
It's rather well guarded.

14:41.253 --> 14:46.425
By its own random-access security code,
changed daily, to which I have the key.

14:46.508 --> 14:49.428
- Well, good for you.
- But I need your help.

14:49.511 --> 14:51.388
I can't get in and out.

14:51.472 --> 14:55.017
I've already got a buyer
who'll give me 40 million for it.

14:55.100 --> 14:58.228
I have no reason to believe
a word you've told me.

14:58.312 --> 15:02.149
- But you want to.
- Why is that?

15:03.651 --> 15:05.819
Because you want the mask.

15:07.780 --> 15:09.406
Mm.

15:09.490 --> 15:12.034
First we try, then we trust.

15:12.117 --> 15:13.619
Meaning what?

15:13.702 --> 15:16.955
Meet me outside the hotel, 9am.
Preferably dressed.

15:17.039 --> 15:21.668
- How do I know you'll be there?
- Oh, I'll be there. And I'm never late.

15:21.752 --> 15:24.004
- Not ever?
- Never.

15:24.088 --> 15:27.508
If I'm late... it's because I'm dead.

15:27.591 --> 15:29.468
Whose hotel? Yours or mine?

15:31.553 --> 15:34.014
Mac?

15:34.932 --> 15:36.975
Mac?

15:44.400 --> 15:47.528
<i>(market trader shouting)</i>

15:51.448 --> 15:53.492
<i>(Mac) Ah, here we are.</i>

15:53.575 --> 15:56.286
You go straight in there and ask for Haas.

15:56.370 --> 15:57.913
- Haas?
- Lovely fella.

15:57.996 --> 15:59.164
Very low-key.

15:59.248 --> 16:03.919
You tell him you want to buy a Qing vase.
The price is Â£200,000...

16:04.002 --> 16:06.922
...which, of course, you won't pay.
- Why not?

16:07.005 --> 16:10.759
Because you're going to steal it.
You are a thief, aren't you?

16:12.010 --> 16:18.058
Take this card, which is fake.
As he turns to swipe it, you swipe the vase.

16:18.851 --> 16:20.435
OK.

16:20.686 --> 16:22.729
Enjoy. I'll be waiting.

16:22.813 --> 16:24.898
- Ooh!
- Sorry!

16:31.029 --> 16:33.115
<i>(shop bell rings)</i>

16:33.532 --> 16:35.617
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

16:42.124 --> 16:45.085
- Hello!
- Hi.

16:46.378 --> 16:50.090
- I'm here for the Qing vase.
- I don't know you.

16:50.174 --> 16:52.676
We've never met before. Mac sent me.

16:54.344 --> 16:57.639
- Where's the money?
- Where's the vase?

17:10.360 --> 17:14.865
- OK, show me the real one.
- No, trust me, babe.

17:14.948 --> 17:18.869
This is better than a real one. 200,000.

17:21.121 --> 17:23.790
- What's that?
- It's a credit card.

17:23.874 --> 17:25.959
Yeah. And?

17:26.043 --> 17:27.794
I need the miles.

17:29.171 --> 17:32.966
What exactly... do you think this is?

17:33.050 --> 17:37.346
- Harrods?
- No, I've never seen rats at Harrods.

17:37.429 --> 17:40.390
You like ajoke, don't you?

17:40.515 --> 17:41.558
Sure.

17:42.392 --> 17:43.894
How funny is this?

17:48.023 --> 17:51.485
I'm sorry.
I made a terrible mistake about the vase.

17:51.568 --> 17:52.694
Too right.

17:59.076 --> 18:01.161
Uh, yeah, I did.

18:21.848 --> 18:26.561
Time's running out.
You can still escape if you're quick.

18:26.645 --> 18:28.689
Now listen.

18:28.772 --> 18:30.399
- Where's the vase?
- I broke it.

18:30.482 --> 18:32.317
- What!
- I'm sorry...

18:46.331 --> 18:47.791
Oh, God!

18:48.500 --> 18:50.168
God bless!

18:51.169 --> 18:53.839
The man had a knife.
What was I supposed to do?

18:53.922 --> 18:58.718
- You were supposed to get the damn vase!
- It was a cheap Victorian knockoff!

19:03.890 --> 19:06.643
You missed the point of the entire exercise.

19:07.561 --> 19:09.646
No, I didn't.

19:10.605 --> 19:12.274
Oh. Good.

19:12.357 --> 19:14.276
Good girl!

19:14.359 --> 19:16.236
- Give it to me.
- What is it?

19:16.319 --> 19:18.196
Give it to me!

19:18.280 --> 19:19.614
What is it?!

19:19.698 --> 19:21.491
Bedford Palace.

19:21.575 --> 19:25.412
The complete plans,
security system, soup to nuts.

19:41.595 --> 19:44.639
Man, look what you've done
to this beautiful car!

19:44.723 --> 19:47.976
Yeah, thank God it's not mine.
Here, some clothes.

19:48.059 --> 19:52.981
- Where are we going? These are my clothes!
- Yes, you have some nice things.

19:53.064 --> 19:57.611
- It was you? You stole my luggage?
- I'm a thief. So sue me.

19:58.153 --> 20:01.156
- And where are we going?
- Up.

20:03.241 --> 20:08.371
- Mac, where is my suitcase?
- It's with hotel security.

20:08.788 --> 20:10.874
With what?!

20:12.417 --> 20:13.919
Why?

20:14.002 --> 20:17.464
Well, there was a robbery yesterday
at Cryptonic.

20:17.547 --> 20:23.053
And someone stole five prototype superchips
worth $4 million each.

20:23.136 --> 20:27.015
And one of these chips
is inside your suitcase.

20:27.098 --> 20:29.476
- With hotel security.
- Yes.

20:29.559 --> 20:34.981
And one anonymous phone call,
from me, plus the photos...

20:35.065 --> 20:37.692
- What photos?
- Oh, yes.

20:38.568 --> 20:39.986
These.

20:41.988 --> 20:44.074
Who took?

20:48.328 --> 20:50.038
Hey!

20:50.121 --> 20:52.958
- This is entrapment!
- What?

20:53.041 --> 20:57.545
- This is called entrapment!
- Actually, it's called blackmail.

20:58.254 --> 20:59.756
Entrapment...

20:59.839 --> 21:03.385
...is what cops do to thieves.

21:04.469 --> 21:06.179
You coming?

21:25.657 --> 21:27.617
Almost there.

22:00.567 --> 22:03.153
No lock? No security?

22:03.236 --> 22:06.030
You're not casing the joint already, are you?

22:06.114 --> 22:08.199
This way.

22:09.742 --> 22:11.828
Oh, wow!

22:12.954 --> 22:15.081
Shall we?

22:23.298 --> 22:25.133
Oh, my God.

22:32.432 --> 22:35.643
- This is quite a collection.
- Thank you.

22:36.352 --> 22:38.605
Only contemporary art?

22:38.688 --> 22:42.734
- You sound surprised.
- No, it's just not what I expected.

22:42.817 --> 22:45.695
Where are the suits of armour
and crossed swords?

22:45.778 --> 22:48.448
Up in the attic. Whiskey?

22:48.531 --> 22:50.617
Sure. I'd love one.

22:52.076 --> 22:53.578
Wow!

22:55.622 --> 22:58.041
Is all this paid for?

22:58.124 --> 23:01.461
- With blood. Cheers.
- To the mask.

23:05.548 --> 23:09.761
- I'll show you to your room.
- Who else do you bring here?

23:10.678 --> 23:11.888
No-one.

23:12.847 --> 23:14.891
- That's sad.
- Why?

23:14.974 --> 23:18.895
Well, to have something like this
and not share it with anyone.

23:18.978 --> 23:23.483
I don't need to share it with anyone.
Most people buy art to show it off.

23:23.566 --> 23:25.777
I collect art for me.

23:25.860 --> 23:27.946
Your room's this way.

23:33.284 --> 23:35.370
Good night, then.

23:35.703 --> 23:39.123
- But it's still early.
- Yes, we have an early start.

23:39.207 --> 23:41.292
But I'm not tired!

23:41.709 --> 23:44.003
<i>Where do you sleep?</i>

23:47.340 --> 23:48.675
Why?

23:49.759 --> 23:51.886
Just in case I need anything.

23:54.973 --> 23:57.934
<i>- May I ask you something?
- Sure.</i>

23:58.059 --> 24:03.856
Has there ever been anyone you couldn't
manipulate, beguile, or seduce?

24:05.149 --> 24:06.192
No.

24:08.444 --> 24:10.947
Why, do I make you uneasy, Mac?

24:12.115 --> 24:14.575
No. No, not at all.

24:15.368 --> 24:22.166
In fact, I think now might be a good time
for you and I to, uh... discuss something.

24:22.542 --> 24:25.670
- Well, what do you have in mind?
- Uh...

24:26.295 --> 24:28.089
The rules.

24:28.172 --> 24:30.049
Oh! OK.

24:30.591 --> 24:34.887
In order for there to be
complete trust between thieves...

24:34.971 --> 24:37.807
...there can be nothing personal.

24:41.894 --> 24:45.189
A job is ajob. You do your part, I do mine.

24:45.857 --> 24:49.861
<i>If one of us thinks about something
other than the task at hand...</i>

24:49.944 --> 24:53.990
...we'll either both get caught,
or both get dead.

24:56.784 --> 24:58.995
Good night again.

25:15.011 --> 25:16.721
<i>(Mac) No...</i>

25:16.804 --> 25:19.474
Nope. No...

25:20.433 --> 25:23.060
No. No.

25:23.519 --> 25:24.729
Nope.

25:25.021 --> 25:27.773
- That's the way in.
- That's the lake.

25:27.857 --> 25:33.613
Yes, I know it's the lake, dear. The first duke
dug a tunnel as a back door for his mistress.

25:33.696 --> 25:36.532
100 years later, they flooded the place.

25:36.616 --> 25:38.701
OK, so we go underwater.

25:39.118 --> 25:44.457
I go underwater. I steal the mask.
You get a finder's fee of 10Âº/...

25:44.540 --> 25:48.044
<i>But I have the code to the mask case, dear.</i>

25:48.127 --> 25:50.796
Which you're now going to give to me.

25:52.381 --> 25:53.841
No!

25:56.636 --> 26:00.556
- Have you been wasting my time?
- Have you been wasting mine?

26:06.646 --> 26:09.315
I'll arrange your return to London.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.654
I'm not who you think I am, Mac.

26:14.737 --> 26:17.031
I hope not, for your sake.

26:18.491 --> 26:20.534
I'm a thief.

26:20.618 --> 26:23.496
So you keep telling me.

26:25.122 --> 26:27.458
I stole the Rembrandt.

26:28.751 --> 26:33.839
- Mac, I stole the Rembrandt!
- And I painted the Sistine Chapel!

26:34.507 --> 26:36.759
Come on! Ask me how I did it!

26:36.842 --> 26:39.553
- How did you do it?
- I came in from the roof.

26:39.637 --> 26:44.183
I dropped 20 floors down
on a McNeal Descender.

26:44.809 --> 26:47.728
- You must be a hell of a climber.
- I am.

26:50.648 --> 26:52.316
Mm?

26:54.568 --> 26:57.029
<i>I am a hell of a climber!</i>

26:58.656 --> 27:04.370
I am... one... hell of a climber.

27:04.453 --> 27:06.914
But how did you get it out of there?

27:07.957 --> 27:09.625
Now that...

27:10.751 --> 27:12.586
...is the most...

27:12.670 --> 27:14.505
...beautiful part!

27:19.093 --> 27:20.553
- I mailed it.
- No!

27:21.178 --> 27:24.515
I put it down their own mail chute.

27:25.683 --> 27:28.436
Simple...

27:29.603 --> 27:32.189
...effective... safe.

27:32.273 --> 27:33.983
That's very clever.

27:34.066 --> 27:37.528
Nope. Not clever.

27:42.450 --> 27:44.785
It was perfect!

27:45.578 --> 27:48.205
Absolutely unbelievable!

27:51.333 --> 27:54.837
<i>You're right. It is beautiful. Mm?</i>

27:55.921 --> 28:00.885
Did you know that Rembrandt lived
with his parents well into his forties?

28:01.635 --> 28:05.055
But of course you'd know that.
You're perfect.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.143
How did you get that?

28:09.226 --> 28:13.105
Why rob the penthouse... when
the mailroom's on the ground floor?

28:15.149 --> 28:17.193
How did you know I took it?

28:17.276 --> 28:22.490
There's only a handful of people
who can make the equipment you used.

28:22.573 --> 28:24.241
And I know all of them.

28:24.325 --> 28:27.703
- Someone was expecting that.
- Obviously.

28:27.787 --> 28:31.332
- Mr Conrad Greene of Kuala Lumpur.
- Oh, God!

28:31.415 --> 28:37.546
What was it? A down payment?
A service this Mr Greene is providing?

28:37.630 --> 28:39.924
Yeah, something like that.

28:41.967 --> 28:47.223
What could you possibly
want to steal in Malaysia?

28:47.306 --> 28:49.808
- Hm?
- A hundred million dollars.

28:52.269 --> 28:54.313
What's the job?

28:54.396 --> 28:57.316
Like the wise man said:

29:00.778 --> 29:03.906
First we try, then we trust.

29:19.338 --> 29:20.798
Ah, good morning.

29:20.881 --> 29:25.302
Wanna tell me why my Jaguar looks like
you drove it off a fuckin' cliff?

29:25.386 --> 29:27.972
Thibadeaux, I'm awfully sorry.

29:28.055 --> 29:33.185
- You owe me 140 G's.
- How about a $40 million Chinese mask?

29:33.269 --> 29:36.981
Is it turbocharged with a six-CD changer?

29:38.399 --> 29:40.484
Did you get everything I need?

29:40.651 --> 29:45.739
- When we done, you buyin' me a new car.
- Agreed. Did you get the small pneumatics?

29:45.823 --> 29:50.202
Yeah, I got the small pneumatics.
You gotta be a damn elf to use 'em.

29:50.286 --> 29:52.162
- The det cord?
- It's in the van.

29:52.246 --> 29:58.168
That's some nasty shit. Don't mix it with
nothing else or you'll be all over the floor.

30:01.046 --> 30:05.342
- What the hell's this?
- IR thermo-camera, what you asked for.

30:05.426 --> 30:11.432
- I specifically said no liquid-plasma screen.
- That was specifically all I could get.

30:11.515 --> 30:14.393
How can I do this without the right tools?

30:14.476 --> 30:19.398
Gimme a break, man.
You think I go to K-Mart and get this shit?

30:19.481 --> 30:22.609
Figure out something. You always do.

30:22.860 --> 30:27.281
- Where's the honey?
- In the loch, training.

30:28.073 --> 30:31.869
I told her I swim for an hour every day,
so she'll do it for two.

30:36.081 --> 30:39.334
So, when is it we do the dirty?

30:39.418 --> 30:42.463
Maybe we should wait a bit.

30:44.423 --> 30:46.842
She's got a biggerjob after this one.

30:46.925 --> 30:49.303
This is big enough, man.

30:50.137 --> 30:52.514
It's never big enough.

30:53.640 --> 30:58.395
- You are keepin' this strictly business, right?
- Strictly.

31:00.939 --> 31:03.817
Have you ever bought a woman's dress?

31:05.360 --> 31:07.946
It's for the job. For her.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.365
I don't know her size.

31:10.657 --> 31:14.411
Well, I'd say she's probably a six, but...

31:14.495 --> 31:16.830
...she'd look real fine in a four.

31:16.914 --> 31:23.253
I had this girl, Tina. She said the dress made
the woman. I say the woman makes the dress.

31:23.337 --> 31:25.422
That's a lovely story.

31:25.714 --> 31:27.925
But could you get the dress?

31:28.008 --> 31:30.511
Mac, you're too old for this shit.

31:33.555 --> 31:36.475
This mask thing better be worth it.

31:36.558 --> 31:38.685
Oh, it is.

31:38.769 --> 31:41.230
<i>It better be worth it for me.</i>

32:32.656 --> 32:35.325
Our gear has arrived.

32:36.577 --> 32:37.911
Who brought it?

32:39.329 --> 32:40.872
Delivery man.

32:40.956 --> 32:47.546
- You order this stuff from a catalogue?
- No, I order it from someone I trust implicitly.

32:47.629 --> 32:50.674
There's lots more, if you're not too tired.

33:07.441 --> 33:10.610
Left a bit. Left a bit. What is it?

33:10.694 --> 33:13.405
- It's 15.
- Good. Now...

33:15.198 --> 33:18.869
Straight back, straight back.
Go on, take it out. Back.

33:18.952 --> 33:24.041
There you go. There.
Yeah, straight back now. Keep it taut. Taut!

33:24.124 --> 33:26.793
There. That's it. Ah, finally!

33:26.877 --> 33:28.295
Good. Well done.

33:33.842 --> 33:34.885
<i>(beep)</i>

33:41.683 --> 33:43.018

...one.

33:49.232 --> 33:52.194
- Five decibels.
- Still too loud.

33:55.947 --> 33:57.324
Set?

33:58.200 --> 34:00.285
- One and...
- Bang.

34:00.368 --> 34:02.496
- Two and...
- Bang.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.664
- Three and...
- Bang.

34:04.748 --> 34:06.917
Four and...

34:07.000 --> 34:09.002
Oh, yeah. Bang.

34:09.294 --> 34:14.132
- The bangs must be with the clock's chimes!
- OK, I forgot, I forgot!

34:14.216 --> 34:15.592
Again.

34:15.675 --> 34:20.013
Knees together. Down, down, tuck.

34:20.097 --> 34:23.642
I'll watch the mask.
You keep your mind on your movement.

34:23.725 --> 34:24.893
Reach!

34:24.976 --> 34:28.563
No, no, no! These are the lasers! Hm?

34:28.647 --> 34:33.401
I am your eyes. So you keep yours closed,
because you can't see. Mm?

34:33.485 --> 34:37.364
But I'll be watching
every move on our screen.

34:37.906 --> 34:41.868
Come on, move! You have three minutes
till the guard gets here!

34:43.203 --> 34:44.955
Up... Good!

34:45.872 --> 34:47.958
Better. Left leg. Left!

34:48.375 --> 34:50.460
<i>- There you...
- (bells ring)</i>

34:51.753 --> 34:52.963
I need a break!

34:53.046 --> 34:56.216
You'll get a break... when you get it right!

34:56.758 --> 34:57.884
Number one!

34:59.469 --> 35:00.804
Two and...

35:00.887 --> 35:02.097
- Bang.
- Three and...

35:02.180 --> 35:03.640
- Bang.
- Four and...

35:03.723 --> 35:06.768
- Bang.
- Five and... inflate!

35:10.939 --> 35:14.192
Well, what's this?
It's supposed to be one second!

35:14.276 --> 35:18.655
- You're supposed to open the valve full!
- I did open it full! Look, it's open!

35:18.738 --> 35:22.033
All right, very well! I'll rectify it later. Hm?

35:22.117 --> 35:23.451
Six.

35:24.077 --> 35:26.997
Lever. Seven. Drop.

35:27.330 --> 35:29.499
- Eight.
- Deflate.

35:30.083 --> 35:31.585
Well done!

35:32.127 --> 35:36.798
I did open it full, OK?
You can go over there and check.

35:42.220 --> 35:44.097
Come on!

35:49.227 --> 35:51.563
Here...

35:51.646 --> 35:54.357
This is where I'm gonna enter into them.

35:54.441 --> 35:58.278
Then I'll come up through the first beam.
The hardest part.

35:58.361 --> 36:01.406
I'm just gonna... You see? Right here.

36:02.657 --> 36:07.329
Once I get under the first beam, I'll be fine.
So don't worry about me, OK?

36:07.412 --> 36:12.834
Once I have this on the computer, I can
visualise it. I can do this blindfolded now.

36:12.917 --> 36:13.960
Really?

36:20.508 --> 36:24.012
- Is this absolutely necessary?
- Yes.

36:24.596 --> 36:29.392
- Because you won't be able to see them...
- And you will. Right.

36:29.476 --> 36:31.561
Trust me.

38:45.528 --> 38:47.280
We're ready!

38:47.363 --> 38:49.741
I'll tell you when we're ready.

38:49.824 --> 38:53.661
You forgot the damn pressure switch,
didn't you?

38:54.912 --> 38:57.790
Jesus! You just can't help it, can you?

38:57.874 --> 39:02.629
- Help what?
- Being such a nasty son of a bitch.

39:02.712 --> 39:05.673
This is how it has to be.

39:06.132 --> 39:09.969
- But if you can't deal with it...
- Hey, Mac? Bullshit!

39:11.346 --> 39:15.099
You know what?
I think you're just afraid to be nice to me!

39:39.248 --> 39:42.794
- For me?
- Well, it's certainly not for me.

39:43.169 --> 39:45.254
Open it.

39:49.967 --> 39:55.390
I thought you were probably a six,
but would look very nice as a four.

40:01.854 --> 40:03.439
It's beautiful.

40:03.523 --> 40:05.191
But?

40:07.276 --> 40:11.239
Believe it or not,
no-one's ever bought me a dress before.

40:11.322 --> 40:13.741
Well, it comes out of your share.

40:18.788 --> 40:20.873
I didn't get you anything.

40:22.417 --> 40:25.461
- Not necessary.
- No, no. I want to.

40:26.838 --> 40:28.673
I won't be long.

40:28.756 --> 40:30.716

- Here he is!

56:43.062 --> 56:45.982
Now this is where we play Truth or Dare.

56:46.065 --> 56:47.191
What?

56:54.323 --> 56:57.034
First we start with truth, huh?

56:57.451 --> 57:01.247
You work for Hector Cruz
at Waverly Insurance, hm?

57:04.458 --> 57:05.710
Now...

57:06.627 --> 57:08.754
...I dare you to lie to me.

57:08.838 --> 57:12.049
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What!

57:15.595 --> 57:19.056
The job was a cover!
That's how I got the code.

57:19.140 --> 57:21.851
No, no, no, you're playing both sides.

57:22.184 --> 57:25.896
You're gonna sell the mask
to Conrad Greene, then turn me in.

57:25.980 --> 57:28.899
- No, I need you for the job.
- There is no otherjob!

57:28.983 --> 57:31.027
There is! It's worth over...

57:33.571 --> 57:36.449
And don't tell me it's worth a hundred million.

57:36.532 --> 57:41.495
It's not. It's, it's... You're right, it's not.
It's worth over a billion.

57:51.380 --> 57:53.591
<i>(Gin gasps)</i>

57:56.135 --> 57:58.763
And that's just your share!

57:59.555 --> 58:01.640
I'm not lying!

58:06.937 --> 58:09.774
I can't do this job without you, Mac.

58:09.857 --> 58:13.027
Please come with me to Kuala Lumpur.

58:23.579 --> 58:26.123
Can you just decide soon, please?

58:31.712 --> 58:33.672
Four, three...

58:33.756 --> 58:35.883
...two, one.

58:36.592 --> 58:42.348
Your time's up. You said you would tell me
what the nextjob is in 24 hours.

58:42.932 --> 58:45.017
It's a bank.

58:47.144 --> 58:49.230
And?

58:49.605 --> 58:52.316
And I didn't say I'd tell you any more.

58:53.609 --> 58:55.778
Isn't it beautiful here?

59:06.372 --> 59:08.457
<i>(car horn)</i>

59:16.465 --> 59:19.468
Banks have never really been my thing.

59:19.760 --> 59:23.138
Think a billion dollars and change your mind.

59:23.430 --> 59:27.810
- I just don't like surprises.
- Trust me, there won't be any.

59:28.310 --> 59:31.647
<i>Trust me. There always are surprises.</i>

59:49.373 --> 59:53.294
I must say, it's, uh... very homey.

59:53.377 --> 59:55.504
Why, thank you!

1:00:03.220 --> 1:00:05.764
Of course, when I said bank...

1:00:06.682 --> 1:00:09.310
...I didn't mean just any bank.

1:00:10.769 --> 1:00:12.605
A room with a view!

1:00:12.688 --> 1:00:17.359
- I give you the world's tallest building.
- And we're going to steal it?

1:00:17.443 --> 1:00:21.113
Home of the International Clearance Bank...

1:00:21.196 --> 1:00:27.453
...which I'm sure you know controls all big
money transactions in Southeast Asia.

1:00:28.412 --> 1:00:31.624
- Do I have your attention now?
- Undivided.

1:00:31.707 --> 1:00:37.296
Here, the headquarters of the International
Clearance Bank in New York.

1:00:37.379 --> 1:00:41.634
Running from there are hackproof,
firewalled, dedicated lines...

1:00:41.717 --> 1:00:45.220
...to computers in its branch offices
around the world.

1:00:45.304 --> 1:00:48.474
The only access is from
central control in New York...

1:00:48.557 --> 1:00:52.603
...or from the totally secure computers
in the branch offices.

1:00:52.686 --> 1:00:57.316
In Kuala Lumpur,
only one man has unlimited access.

1:00:57.399 --> 1:01:02.863
<i>Lee Kuan Hong, Chairman of the International
Clearance Bank of Kuala Lumpur.</i>

1:01:02.946 --> 1:01:08.619
Vaults are accessed by two things: a key code
and a completely unfakeable retinal scan.

1:01:09.453 --> 1:01:12.164
- Morning, everyone. Nice day, uh?
- Hi.

1:01:12.247 --> 1:01:14.416
Arghhh!

1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:16.543
Which we're gonna fake.

1:01:17.086 --> 1:01:20.547
<i>Right now, our Chairman,
with a face full of Mace...</i>

1:01:20.631 --> 1:01:22.925
<i>... is getting his eyes checked...</i>

1:01:23.008 --> 1:01:26.261
<i>... with a little help from
Conrad Greene's guys...</i>

1:01:26.345 --> 1:01:28.013
<i>... hopefully.</i>

1:01:28.972 --> 1:01:31.600
- With me so far?
- All the way.

1:01:31.683 --> 1:01:36.688
Now, because of the millennium bug,
our friends at International Clearance...

1:01:36.772 --> 1:01:41.819
...will be running integrity tests,
which they're rehearsing as we speak.

1:01:41.902 --> 1:01:46.824
<i>- Prepare test shutdown for Sydney in...
- Just before midnight, local time...</i>

1:01:46.907 --> 1:01:50.661
<i>... they'll shut down the mainframe
in each zone for 30 seconds.</i>

1:01:50.744 --> 1:01:53.831
- Sydney is shut down.
- Run test program.

1:01:53.914 --> 1:01:57.709
Now we need those 30 seconds
to patch into the mainframe.

1:01:57.793 --> 1:02:03.966
We then need ten seconds of one-on-one time
with the computer, to download...

1:02:04.049 --> 1:02:07.553
..."the stuff".
- How do we acquire those ten seconds?

1:02:07.636 --> 1:02:08.929
We steal 'em.

1:02:09.012 --> 1:02:14.935
<i>The transmitter I left behind simply overrides
the signal of the atomic clock. So...</i>

1:02:15.018 --> 1:02:20.357
...from 11pm tomorrow night their clocks gain
a fraction of a second every minute...

1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:23.026
...and we gain our ten seconds.

1:02:23.110 --> 1:02:26.530
And what is this "stuff" we are downloading?

1:02:38.125 --> 1:02:40.043
Enya?

1:02:40.127 --> 1:02:44.590
Cunningly disguised in there is a disk
that took me five years to make...

1:02:44.673 --> 1:02:48.176
...cooped up in my broom closet
at Waverly Insurance.

1:02:48.260 --> 1:02:53.056
It tells the ICB computer to transfer
relatively small amounts of money...

1:02:53.140 --> 1:02:57.686
...from hundreds of corporations all over
Southeast Asia into my account.

1:02:57.769 --> 1:03:00.647
<i>- Our account.
- Yeah, our account.</i>

1:03:01.273 --> 1:03:04.067
Eight billion dollars in total.

1:03:04.902 --> 1:03:07.237
<i>You said one billion.</i>

1:03:07.321 --> 1:03:10.532
<i>Mm-mm. I said that was your share.</i>

1:03:10.616 --> 1:03:14.703
What can you do with seven billion
that you can't do with four?

1:03:16.163 --> 1:03:18.248
Hold the record.

1:03:18.916 --> 1:03:21.001
Alone.

1:03:21.585 --> 1:03:23.545
Sounds rather Ionely.

1:03:23.629 --> 1:03:25.589
Alone?

1:03:25.672 --> 1:03:27.633
No. Alone is good.

1:03:28.884 --> 1:03:31.386
- You want a beer?
- Thank you.

1:03:32.638 --> 1:03:36.016
- We'll need three weeks to prepare.
- What?

1:03:36.099 --> 1:03:40.145
- Minimum.
- No. It has to be tomorrow night.

1:03:40.562 --> 1:03:42.189
No way.

1:03:42.272 --> 1:03:46.652
You don't understand. It has to be
millennium midnight or it's never.

1:03:46.735 --> 1:03:49.321
Then it's never. It's impossible.

1:03:55.744 --> 1:03:57.871
You...

1:04:01.249 --> 1:04:03.960
OK. Fifty-fifty.

1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:05.962
What?

1:04:07.631 --> 1:04:09.716
You heard.

1:04:12.260 --> 1:04:14.346
It's impossible.

1:04:16.932 --> 1:04:19.017
But doable.

1:04:47.003 --> 1:04:52.426
<i>(tour guide) Ladies and gentlemen, we are
now standing over 700ft above sea level.</i>

1:04:52.509 --> 1:04:56.138
Our skybridge is the longest
and highest in the world.

1:04:56.221 --> 1:04:59.933
It stretches over 300ft to the opposite tower.

1:05:00.016 --> 1:05:04.479
It is supported, as you can see,
by four flexible steel pillars.

1:05:04.563 --> 1:05:08.483
The lights are being hung
for our millennium party tomorrow.

1:05:08.567 --> 1:05:14.281
Over 40,000 light bulbs
will make this truly a sight to remember.

1:07:19.989 --> 1:07:25.537
So, what have we here? We have the goggles
with the chairman's retinal scan.

1:07:25.620 --> 1:07:29.999
And we have the chairman's
access card to the 86th floor...

1:07:31.876 --> 1:07:33.086
...in the bag.

1:07:33.169 --> 1:07:35.088
Anything else I need to know?

1:07:35.171 --> 1:07:39.634
Confucius, he say:
Don't use cannon to kill mosquito.

1:07:41.302 --> 1:07:43.263
Right!

1:07:43.346 --> 1:07:48.184
Well, now that I've shown you mine,
it's your turn to show me yours.

1:07:48.268 --> 1:07:52.939
- Well, here she is.
- Oh, goody, goody, goody!

1:07:53.022 --> 1:07:54.899
Bring it to Papa.

1:07:54.983 --> 1:07:59.404
Oh! A thing of beauty, huh? Ajoy forever!

1:08:00.780 --> 1:08:04.242
And where's the mask?
I want my mask. Come on!

1:08:04.951 --> 1:08:08.913
Oh! So you're working
with MacDougal on this, huh?

1:08:08.997 --> 1:08:10.123
Yeah.

1:08:10.206 --> 1:08:12.125
Uh-huh.

1:08:13.918 --> 1:08:15.295
Uh-huh.

1:08:15.628 --> 1:08:19.966
I would suggest that you have
a little tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with your partner.

1:08:20.049 --> 1:08:22.302
If he's still in the country.

1:08:22.385 --> 1:08:26.347
In the meantime,
I'll hold on to the access card and goggles.

1:08:28.183 --> 1:08:32.604
Conrad, you've gotta believe me.
I had no idea.

1:08:32.687 --> 1:08:37.692
- I swear to God, I'd never do this to you!
- Don't! Don't pout at me, you little bitch!

1:08:37.775 --> 1:08:41.029
- Come on, Conrad.
- Get out of here! Get out!

1:08:41.112 --> 1:08:44.574
Get out! Just get out! Get outta here!

1:08:51.247 --> 1:08:53.583
<i>Baby, I'm glad to see you!</i>

1:08:54.375 --> 1:08:56.377
I'm calling it off.

1:08:56.461 --> 1:09:00.340
You take this.
I'll get the Rembrandt for you later.

1:09:00.423 --> 1:09:04.719
- What you sayin'
- She's over her head. It's not happening.

1:09:04.802 --> 1:09:08.806
What about the big, giant, huge job
you were all cute about in Scotland?

1:09:08.890 --> 1:09:12.727
Now you wouldn't be tryin'
to cut a brother out of anything?

1:09:12.810 --> 1:09:16.105
- There's nothing to cut you out of.
- Sit down, Mac.

1:09:16.189 --> 1:09:18.024
Sit down.

1:09:18.107 --> 1:09:21.486
I said, sit the fuck down.

1:09:30.370 --> 1:09:35.833
You know, Mac, I think it's time
to take your girlfriend out of the equation...

1:09:35.917 --> 1:09:40.713
...and get down to the you-and-me of it all.
- She's not my girlfriend.

1:09:40.797 --> 1:09:47.303
See, I'm gettin' this little Yoko vibe, like all of
a sudden your girlfriend's the one in control.

1:09:59.816 --> 1:10:04.862
Now, you change partners,
you change the rules.

1:10:04.946 --> 1:10:09.325
And the rules are... Mac does the job.

1:10:09.409 --> 1:10:11.494
I watch Mac's back.

1:10:11.577 --> 1:10:14.622
You don't call off nothin' unless I say so.

1:10:29.804 --> 1:10:32.306
Gin?

1:10:39.188 --> 1:10:41.274
Gin?

1:10:44.026 --> 1:10:47.530
Where is it, you bastard?! I trusted you!

1:10:49.031 --> 1:10:52.493
- You bastard! I trusted you! I trusted you!
- Gin! Hey! Gin!

1:10:52.577 --> 1:10:54.746
Where is it?!

1:11:01.836 --> 1:11:03.671
Why'd you take it?

1:11:04.630 --> 1:11:07.717
Get up! I know you're faking!

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:08.718
Ohh!

1:11:13.764 --> 1:11:16.267
<i>(Gin sobs)</i>

1:11:38.581 --> 1:11:40.791
Where'd you go?

1:11:40.875 --> 1:11:44.837
- Why'd you take it?
- I was going to sell it.

1:11:45.087 --> 1:11:47.381
Then why didn't you?

1:11:48.507 --> 1:11:52.303
Because... I... couldn't do it.

1:11:53.012 --> 1:11:55.097
Why not?

1:11:56.432 --> 1:12:00.436
I knew that if I told you to forget this job...

1:12:00.519 --> 1:12:02.855
...get the hell outta here...

1:12:03.481 --> 1:12:06.609
...you wouldn't do it, would you?

1:12:06.692 --> 1:12:08.319
- Hm?
- No.

1:12:08.402 --> 1:12:10.321
Mm. Right.

1:12:16.327 --> 1:12:19.956

- Well, yes.

1:12:20.039 --> 1:12:23.417
- Were you?
- I was worried about both of us.

1:12:28.631 --> 1:12:31.092
- Don't be.
- Hm.

1:12:32.009 --> 1:12:35.763
Whoops, sorry. Forgot about the rules.

1:12:37.682 --> 1:12:39.642
Mm.

1:12:41.060 --> 1:12:43.604
Have you ever broken 'em, Mac?

1:12:44.063 --> 1:12:46.148
No.

1:12:46.399 --> 1:12:49.694
- Not once?
- No.

1:12:52.196 --> 1:12:54.115
Never?

1:12:54.365 --> 1:12:56.450
Never.

1:13:00.371 --> 1:13:03.082
Alone is... good, eh?

1:13:03.499 --> 1:13:05.584
No. Bullshit.

1:13:05.668 --> 1:13:08.462
I hate alone. Alone sucks.

1:13:42.496 --> 1:13:44.874
My situation is...

What are you doing here?

Oh, I read in the newspapers
that the mask thing's gone down.

1:15:49.581 --> 1:15:53.168
I don't hear from my trusty agent,
so naturally I worry.

1:15:54.503 --> 1:15:58.507
I call the hospitals, I call the morgue...

1:15:59.049 --> 1:16:02.011
...and, finally, I call the airlines.

1:16:03.554 --> 1:16:08.308
I'm a man badly in need of news here,
Miss Baker. Help me out.

1:16:08.392 --> 1:16:13.814
You want news, Hector? The news is, I don't
appreciate you blowing my cover like this.

1:16:13.897 --> 1:16:18.736
He's planning ajob that's
gonna make the mask look like...

1:16:19.820 --> 1:16:25.367
You don't believe me? Fine.
Then pull me in and pick him up.

1:16:25.451 --> 1:16:30.164

seem to be getting so close to Mac?

Are you sure there's nothing else
you wanna tell me?

1:16:43.594 --> 1:16:48.891
Look, give me until tomorrow.
I promise you, you'll have it all.

1:16:51.518 --> 1:16:53.604

1:17:00.110 --> 1:17:02.196
Don't lose her.

Guess she didn't appreciate my pictures.
Did I tell you, or did I tell you?

1:17:12.122 --> 1:17:16.376
- She's screwin' you both, man.
- She says it's business. I believe her.

1:17:16.460 --> 1:17:20.923
Yeah, she's probably on her way to Mr Mac
right now to do a little "business".

1:17:21.006 --> 1:17:25.385
Don't do that. You do not do that!
You do not speak like that! You do not!

1:17:25.469 --> 1:17:29.932
Hector, baby! There ain't no need
to get all up and hard, my man!

1:17:30.057 --> 1:17:33.644
Now I said I'd make this trip
worth your while.

1:17:33.769 --> 1:17:36.063
You better be right.

He doesn't look very dangerous, does he?

1:21:37.220 --> 1:21:38.513
Not yet.

- 70th floor, sir.

1:22:11.921 --> 1:22:16.092
- Watching the fireworks, probably.
- Do you have cameras up there?

1:22:16.176 --> 1:22:18.303
- Of course.
- Would you mind?

1:22:26.436 --> 1:22:27.896
Mmm.

- I can't find them, sir.

Find them!

Listen, I don't mean to intrude,
but these people are very, very smart.

1:22:48.083 --> 1:22:52.712
If they've disappeared, it's because they
mean to. Is there any art in this building?

Some.

1:22:54.130 --> 1:22:59.094
- And the Bank Clearance House?
- Nothing but a big computer.

1:35:18.165 --> 1:35:20.459
Next stop, vent shaft.

1:36:04.294 --> 1:36:08.340
<i>(megaphone) Armed police!
Put your hands above your head!</i>

1:36:08.423 --> 1:36:13.678
<i>- Do not move. Remain where you are.
- SWATteam to the roof.</i>

1:36:13.762 --> 1:36:15.597
<i>SWAT team to the roof.</i>

1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:17.766
Let's go, let's go!

1:36:18.016 --> 1:36:19.809
Move, move, move!

1:36:20.185 --> 1:36:24.272
If you can't feel alive now, you never will.

1:36:26.149 --> 1:36:27.025
Go!

1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:31.071
<i>Control, we have a clean shot. Do we take it?</i>

1:36:31.154 --> 1:36:34.741
<i>- I repeat, do we take it?
- Negative, Team Leader. Negative.</i>

1:36:34.824 --> 1:36:38.286
Do you copy?
I want these people alive and kicking.

1:36:40.413 --> 1:36:42.916
Go! Get up into the shaft!

1:36:53.176 --> 1:36:54.803
<i>(Gin) Come on!</i>

1:36:58.431 --> 1:36:59.933
Now...

1:37:00.809 --> 1:37:03.061
- Plan B. Turn around.
- What?

1:37:03.144 --> 1:37:04.771
Turn around.

1:37:07.524 --> 1:37:11.152
This is a mini-chute.
But it only works for the updraft.

1:37:12.487 --> 1:37:18.118
- I'm not going without you. We go together.
- No, no, no, too heavy. We'd drop like stones.

1:37:18.660 --> 1:37:20.787
So when will I see you again?

1:37:20.870 --> 1:37:23.581
Meet me at 6.30am, Pudu train station.

1:37:23.665 --> 1:37:26.918
You'd better be there, OK?
Promise me you'll be there.

1:37:27.002 --> 1:37:31.589
I will be there. I'm never late.
If I'm late, it's because I'm dead.

1:37:31.673 --> 1:37:33.008
Now...

1:37:33.299 --> 1:37:34.718
...rip cord.

1:37:39.931 --> 1:37:40.974
Ho!

1:37:48.398 --> 1:37:50.817
<i>(SWAT team yelling)</i>

1:37:54.154 --> 1:37:56.239
<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

1:39:47.558 --> 1:39:49.602
My God! Mac!

1:39:49.686 --> 1:39:53.856
- Agh!
- Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Are you all right?

1:39:55.233 --> 1:39:56.651
So what's wrong?

1:39:56.734 --> 1:40:02.282
Wrong? Nothing's wrong.
Everything is the... way it has to be.

1:40:02.365 --> 1:40:04.200
- What?
- Virginia Baker?

1:40:04.284 --> 1:40:07.328
- Special Agent Aaron Thibadeaux, FBI.
- Come on!

1:40:07.412 --> 1:40:11.541
You're under arrest for grand larceny.
You have the right to remain silent...

1:40:11.624 --> 1:40:12.917
Mac?

1:40:13.668 --> 1:40:14.711
Mac!

1:40:14.794 --> 1:40:17.630
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

1:40:17.714 --> 1:40:21.175
Thanks, Mac. You got your one minute.

1:40:32.812 --> 1:40:34.689
You're a cop.

1:40:35.231 --> 1:40:37.942
No. Well, not exactly.

1:40:38.026 --> 1:40:42.113
Thibadeaux, believe it or not,
is FBI. And two years ago...

1:40:42.196 --> 1:40:47.326
...he caught me and, uh, cut a deal.
The deal was that... I had to deliver you.

1:40:49.328 --> 1:40:52.248
They've been onto you for quite a while.

1:40:53.833 --> 1:40:56.794
- And Cruz knew, too?
- No, he's just found out.

1:40:57.754 --> 1:41:03.801
I don't get it. Why didn't you pick me up
before? What were you waiting for?

1:41:04.510 --> 1:41:08.931
Well, at first I, uh... well,
I wanted to see if you could do it.

1:41:09.015 --> 1:41:10.767
Bullshit! Come on!

1:41:11.809 --> 1:41:14.562
And I wanted to see if I could do it.

1:41:15.897 --> 1:41:17.982
Weren't we partners?

1:41:18.524 --> 1:41:21.027
I can't believe you'd do this to me.

1:41:21.110 --> 1:41:24.781
Well, you'd better believe it! Hm? It's all over.

1:41:24.864 --> 1:41:29.118
I gave them Greene,
the Rembrandt, the mask...

1:41:29.202 --> 1:41:32.079
...and the full seven billion.

1:41:33.372 --> 1:41:35.625
What do you mean, seven?

1:41:35.958 --> 1:41:39.587
So you'll just have to make do with one, hm?

1:41:41.214 --> 1:41:46.219
- I thought you said one minute.
- Relax, Hector. He knows what he's doin'

1:41:46.302 --> 1:41:48.554
Now, plan C.

1:41:48.971 --> 1:41:53.559
In your pocket, you'll find an envelope.
A passport, visa, money.

1:41:54.101 --> 1:42:00.608
Where you go from here is up to you.
And you'll still hold the record... alone.

1:42:00.691 --> 1:42:03.236
<i>(Thibadeaux) Mac!</i>

1:42:03.694 --> 1:42:08.783
- I don't understand. Why are you doing this?
- Well, believe me...

1:42:09.325 --> 1:42:12.745
...I was prepared for everything, except you.

1:42:17.833 --> 1:42:20.836
Mac! Time's up!

1:42:21.504 --> 1:42:23.506
Come with me.

1:42:23.589 --> 1:42:25.508
Gin...

1:42:26.717 --> 1:42:29.011
...your life, it's all ahead of you.

1:42:29.095 --> 1:42:32.014
Mine... this is all I've got.

1:42:32.098 --> 1:42:33.891
No. You've got me.

1:42:36.269 --> 1:42:39.272
<i>(whispers) You got me.</i>

1:42:43.359 --> 1:42:47.280
Listen carefully. In your other pocket...

1:42:48.364 --> 1:42:50.449
Let's do it.

1:42:56.122 --> 1:43:00.293
- Move and I blow his head off!
- Everybody, just be cool.

1:43:00.376 --> 1:43:04.255
- Nobody move! No-one moves, OK?
- Fellas, put your weapons down.

1:43:04.338 --> 1:43:08.926
- You, too, Hector! I'll kill him if you move!
- We'll get her at the next stop.

1:43:09.885 --> 1:43:11.971
Bye, Mac.

1:43:12.972 --> 1:43:16.225
She's headed toward the next station.
Move! Move it!

1:43:16.309 --> 1:43:19.228
- No guns! Get out of here!
- Move it! Move it!

1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:50.217
<i>You know, I don't know
what just went down here...</i>

1:43:50.301 --> 1:43:55.056
...but I'm gonna see that you're busted
outta the Bureau for it.

1:43:55.181 --> 1:43:59.060
- It ain't over, Mac.
- I believe you.

1:44:12.531 --> 1:44:17.244
Well, Mac, this looks like
the end of a terrible friendship.

1:44:17.328 --> 1:44:19.914
But you still owe me for today.

1:44:21.832 --> 1:44:24.085
I always pay my debts.

1:44:25.419 --> 1:44:30.716
Four prototype superchips.
Value: five million dollars each.

1:44:39.725 --> 1:44:42.019
Hope she was worth it.

1:44:42.686 --> 1:44:44.772
Oh, she was.

1:44:45.272 --> 1:44:47.691
I'll be seein' you, Mac.

1:44:48.984 --> 1:44:51.070
I don't think so.

1:44:55.825 --> 1:44:58.994
OK, Bob, let the people back on the platform.

1:44:59.078 --> 1:45:01.163
Bring me a damn car.

1:46:12.693 --> 1:46:14.778
How did you do it?

1:46:14.862 --> 1:46:19.533
I jumped trains mid-station.
When the train slowed down, I just...

1:46:19.617 --> 1:46:22.786
- It was perfect.
- Was it now?

1:46:24.538 --> 1:46:28.625
You know what, Mac?
I don't wanna hold the record alone.

1:46:28.709 --> 1:46:31.670
- No?
- I need your help on anotherjob.

1:46:31.754 --> 1:46:36.717
- The Crown Jewels or something?
- No! Come on, too easy!

1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:40.888
I was thinking of... Well...
I know this guy in South Africa.

1:46:40.971 --> 1:46:45.517
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds! The biggest
diamonds you'll ever see in your life!

1:46:45.601 --> 1:46:48.103
Have I told you how much I love diamonds?

1:46:49.688 --> 1:46:51.857
Mac?

1:46:54.443 --> 1:46:56.528
Mac?

1:46:57.946 --> 1:47:00.532
- Mac!
- What!

1:47:04.328 --> 1:47:06.580
So, what do you think?

1:47:06.955 --> 1:47:09.917
- About what?
- About my idea.

1:47:12.503 --> 1:47:14.588
It's doable.

1:47:18.258 --> 1:47:20.969
- Ohh!
- Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
