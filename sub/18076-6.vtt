00:00.317 --> 00:04.488
In 1972, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:04.571 --> 00:05.989
for a crime they didn't commit.

00:06.115 --> 00:09.034
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum security stockade...

00:09.118 --> 00:10.702
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:10.828 --> 00:14.289
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:14.373 --> 00:16.917
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:17.000 --> 00:21.046
and if you can find them,
maybe you can hire the A-Team.

01:37.247 --> 01:39.458
All right, head them up over there.

01:46.465 --> 01:50.469
- Carter.
- This is Stryker. Herd got away.

01:50.552 --> 01:52.095
It was that Indian again.

01:52.221 --> 01:56.808
- You let him get away again, too?
- No, sir. Not this time.

01:56.850 --> 02:00.646
You send him back to his reservation
in a basket, you hear?

02:00.771 --> 02:02.147
You say he ships them by rail?

02:02.272 --> 02:05.984
Those railroad tracks that we passed
coming out of town? That's his line.

02:06.109 --> 02:09.863
He's got locomotives and boxcars
which he uses to move out his cattle.

02:09.947 --> 02:13.492
I'm sure he takes the horses
down to a slaughter-house in Mexico...

02:13.659 --> 02:15.035
which is only a short run from here.

02:15.118 --> 02:17.454
I want you to bring the A-Team in.

02:17.579 --> 02:19.873
You were the best troubleshooter
the past two wars.

02:19.998 --> 02:23.418
Until extreme political pressures
knocked the hat off my career...

02:24.002 --> 02:26.964
What I'm interested in, Colonel, is results.

02:27.089 --> 02:31.426
You erase the blot
from our records and I'll be very pleased.

02:31.510 --> 02:33.804
Which means that others
will be very pleased.

02:33.971 --> 02:35.472
Do what you have to do.

02:36.306 --> 02:37.975
Get me the A-Team.

02:38.308 --> 02:40.978
My niece is a good girl.

02:41.311 --> 02:43.230
Young, idealistic.

02:43.355 --> 02:47.276
It bothers me a lot that she even might have
the slightest inkling of what we're doing.

02:47.401 --> 02:50.028
Uncle Bus, I'm through.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.824
I kept Sentinel ready all year long
waiting for you to visit.

02:53.949 --> 02:55.742
You only been riding about an hour.

02:55.951 --> 02:57.953
I think I'm a little saddle sore.

02:58.161 --> 03:02.499
Somehow, riding the horse trails
in San Francisco just isn't quite the same.

03:02.666 --> 03:04.376
And just who the heck are you?

03:04.543 --> 03:08.255
I'm the mysterious rider of the plains,
the Range Rider...

03:08.380 --> 03:10.674
and these are my trusty companions.

03:11.383 --> 03:15.012
Boys, looks like we found ourselves
some goofballs.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.727
And don't worry,
we'll find out who these crackerboxes are.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.645
I figure it's that Indian.

03:23.895 --> 03:26.315
And he's rounded himself up some help.

03:26.481 --> 03:29.234
Only help I'm worried about him getting
is legal help.

03:29.776 --> 03:33.822
On the other hand, if he's just hired himself
a couple of gunslingers...

03:34.031 --> 03:37.075
we know how to handle that, don't we?

03:48.795 --> 03:52.591
Face, this stuff really stinks.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.428
What is in this grease anyway?

03:56.511 --> 03:59.931
- It's not grease.
- <i>What is it?</i>

04:00.599 --> 04:01.808
Face?

04:04.644 --> 04:05.771
Face?

04:05.979 --> 04:08.690
You know,
this worked great in a movie I did.

04:08.815 --> 04:11.985
The Giant Gila Monster
Versus Billy the Kid, right?

04:12.110 --> 04:14.279
- You remember that one.
- Who could forget it?

05:23.432 --> 05:25.434
I think you know what to do.

05:53.003 --> 05:54.671
Go on, you devils!

06:27.871 --> 06:30.790
Once again,
the mysterious Rider of the Range...

06:30.874 --> 06:34.503
deals another triumphant blow
for the rights of the oppressed.

06:34.669 --> 06:37.714
- Don't ask.
- I wasn't going to.

06:38.507 --> 06:41.343
♪ I'm just a lonesome cowboy ♪

06:41.426 --> 06:43.261
♪ I'm just a lonesome cowboy ♪

06:43.345 --> 06:46.890
♪ And I got no summer home ♪

06:47.182 --> 06:50.519
Whoever heard of bandits on horseback
in the 1980s?

06:50.644 --> 06:53.855
According to Wesley,
they came riding down on the train...

06:53.980 --> 06:55.815
like they was the James gang or something.

06:55.941 --> 06:59.319
I want you and the boys to get out there
and round up them mustangs...

06:59.402 --> 07:01.988
before they get to the grassland
and wipe out my herd.

07:02.072 --> 07:04.115
First thing tomorrow morning,
I want you to you ship them...

07:04.199 --> 07:06.451
and every other horse we got out of here.

07:06.868 --> 07:08.912
And find them yahoos.

07:11.581 --> 07:14.167
Well, Bus,
we've checked every hotel there is in Lodi...

07:14.251 --> 07:16.503
and I got a man watching the reservation.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.838
But If they're just camping out someplace...

07:18.922 --> 07:21.132
we're talking
about hundreds of thousands of acres.

07:21.216 --> 07:24.844
Then use the chopper.
Do whatever you gotta do, but find them.

07:29.641 --> 07:31.059
Morning, Miss Lane.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.311
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be up this early.

07:33.562 --> 07:37.482
- I heard you talking.
- Just some business problems.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.496
I don't mind if I do.

07:51.830 --> 07:54.666
Who the devil are you?
What are you doing here?

07:54.874 --> 07:56.376
You'll find out.

08:01.256 --> 08:04.634
This is a stupid move.
You yahoos are crazy to come back here.

08:04.801 --> 08:08.722
I agree. I told you it was crazy.
He never listens.

08:08.805 --> 08:11.725
We're here to file a grievance
against the Carter Railway Line...

08:11.850 --> 08:14.352
for the Wild Horses of America,
Western Divisions.

08:14.436 --> 08:16.688
Not to be confused
with the Horses' Butts of America...

08:16.813 --> 08:19.065
of which we hear you are a member
of long standing.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.276
And we would deeply appreciate it...

08:21.443 --> 08:24.779
if you would stop harassing
our dues-paying loyal membership...

08:24.988 --> 08:28.908
which includes all the wild mustangs
that run in this free land.

08:29.034 --> 08:30.243
Both of you are dead.

08:30.327 --> 08:32.871
No, wait,
you don't seem to get the point here.

08:33.038 --> 08:35.832
We're the ones making the threats
and you better believe us.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.293
We hear so much as a neigh
from one of those mustangs out there...

08:38.376 --> 08:40.378
we'll be back to hogtie
and brand you for good.

08:41.337 --> 08:43.506
Now you get all of your papers
out of your safe...

08:43.881 --> 08:47.552
that have to do with the slaughter-house
you do business with in Mexico.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.970
Now.

09:09.741 --> 09:13.119
Bingo. Puppy Love Dog Food Company
in Ensenada.

09:14.704 --> 09:16.915
- Great shot.
- Yeah.

09:35.266 --> 09:36.685
Get out of here!

09:40.730 --> 09:42.524
Hold your fire! Don't shoot!

09:42.607 --> 09:46.277
It's awfully kind of Miss Carter
to escort us out.

09:46.361 --> 09:47.237
Tell them.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.240
All right,
I want all you high school dropouts...

09:50.323 --> 09:53.827
to count to 125 before you even twitch.

09:56.496 --> 09:57.747
Get them.

10:09.050 --> 10:10.845
Move it!

10:23.106 --> 10:25.275
Not exactly coming naturally, is it?

10:25.483 --> 10:29.279
It's like anything else, Amy.
It takes some practise and a little technique.

10:29.404 --> 10:31.948
A lot like driving a golf ball
or shooting skeet.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.491
Come on.

10:35.452 --> 10:36.578
Okay, bring it up.

10:36.745 --> 10:39.289
Straighten this arm and crook your elbow.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.542
Very nice.

10:46.755 --> 10:49.966
Boy, the well is never dry with you,
is it, Face?

10:50.925 --> 10:53.970
If I had pulled that "let me show you
how to aim that thing" routine...

10:54.053 --> 10:55.305
you'd never let me hear the end of it.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.432
I caught the act as I rode up.

10:57.557 --> 11:00.059
So, how's the arm, Danny?
Feeling better, is it?

11:00.185 --> 11:03.188
I'd like to introduce our guest.
This is Miss Carter.

11:03.271 --> 11:05.398
- Bus Carter's niece?
- That's right.

11:05.815 --> 11:08.026
Just how long do you think
you can get away with this?

11:08.109 --> 11:10.653
- With what?
- Holding me against my will.

11:10.737 --> 11:13.490
We're not holding you against your will.
We just borrowed you.

11:13.615 --> 11:16.493
- You're free to go anytime.
- You kidnapped me.

11:16.618 --> 11:19.537
That was just to keep
from being dropped in a deep hole...

11:19.621 --> 11:21.164
on Bus Carter's north 40.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.291
We're not the criminals around here.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.835
We will let the law decide that.

11:26.127 --> 11:28.880
I don't think your Uncle would want
to bring the law in on this.

11:29.005 --> 11:31.007
They might investigate too deeply
and find out...

11:31.174 --> 11:34.260
that he's been rounding up wild mustangs
and selling them illegally.

11:34.385 --> 11:37.055
- My uncle?
- That's right, your uncle.

11:37.180 --> 11:40.141
They round up the horses,
then ship them by train...

11:40.225 --> 11:41.935
to a dog food company in Mexico.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.854
It'd make real interesting reading
for Amy's subscribers.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.232
I see you got yourself
some new arrows there.

11:47.357 --> 11:50.151
Kid, listen, I just brought one jacket, so...

11:51.736 --> 11:56.574
I tried to convince myself it was Stryker.
I even went to Uncle Bus.

11:57.075 --> 11:59.661
I guess I believed he was involved all along.

12:01.204 --> 12:04.916
You just walk up that way north, you should
come across your uncle's men by dawn.

12:05.041 --> 12:08.253
We'd give you a horse to ride,
but then one of us would be on foot.

12:08.336 --> 12:11.130
So, happy trails.

12:11.881 --> 12:15.176
Aren't you afraid I'll tell him where
your camp is, or what you look like?

12:15.260 --> 12:18.513
By that time,
we'll have struck camp and be long gone.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.056
As for what we look like...

12:20.223 --> 12:23.518
I don't plan on sticking around long enough
to get picked out of a line-up.

12:27.730 --> 12:28.857
Wait.

12:30.859 --> 12:33.653
I think I heard my uncle saying...

12:33.736 --> 12:35.613
that there's still more horses
to be shipped out...

12:35.697 --> 12:38.074
and that Stryker should get that done
first thing.

12:38.616 --> 12:40.118
Adiós.

12:54.924 --> 12:59.262
♪ I'm an old cowhand From the Rio Grande ♪

12:59.387 --> 13:03.725
♪ And I learned to ride ♪
♪ before I learned to stand ♪

13:03.850 --> 13:05.935
If you don't shut up,
I'll knock you off that horse!

13:06.269 --> 13:08.438
Yippy-I-O-Ki-Ay.

13:09.230 --> 13:11.024
Murdock, why don't you take rearguard...

13:11.107 --> 13:13.568
in case one of Carter's men
picks up our trail?

13:19.490 --> 13:23.411
Carter knows we have all the proof we need
to shut him down right here.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.955
Has to figure we're gonna head for the hills.

13:26.789 --> 13:28.833
We are heading for the hills,
aren't we, Hannibal?

13:28.917 --> 13:30.168
I don't know.

13:30.627 --> 13:32.962
It's gonna take a couple of days
for Amy to file that story...

13:33.087 --> 13:34.547
and get an investigation started.

13:34.672 --> 13:37.216
Carter's niece did say
there's another shipment of mustangs...

13:37.300 --> 13:40.970
- going out tomorrow morning.
- Hannibal, come on.

13:41.054 --> 13:44.599
Hitting this guy's train twice in a row.
That's kind of pushing it, isn't it?

13:44.682 --> 13:47.435
A lot. That's why we gotta get
some stuff together...

13:47.560 --> 13:48.895
to keep him from pushing back too hard.

13:48.978 --> 13:53.274
Carter's no idiot. He has to figure that us
making another run on his train so soon...

13:53.441 --> 13:55.610
it's insane. He'll never be ready for us.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.863
No, I don't think he'll ever be ready for us.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.616
You think he'll be ready for us?

14:02.241 --> 14:04.452
- Yeah, I do.
- So do I.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.539
Better sharpen your pencil
and your spurs, Face.

14:09.707 --> 14:12.043
You know, we're only one step
ahead of Decker, too.

14:12.126 --> 14:15.338
- Don't worry, I've considered that.
- Of course you have.

14:17.340 --> 14:20.051
I think he's going
to be a big problem.

14:35.274 --> 14:36.609
Colonel, they're here.

14:36.901 --> 14:38.069
They sure are.

14:38.236 --> 14:41.990
Apparently they mixed it up
with a couple of locals right here yesterday.

14:42.156 --> 14:45.535
No one seems to know what it's about,
but knowing Hannibal Smith and his men...

14:45.618 --> 14:48.913
they've probably took on
some bleeding-heart cause or other.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.708
No doubt requested by Daniel Running Bear.

14:51.874 --> 14:54.711
The shop-keeper said they picked up
some camping gear and other supplies...

14:54.836 --> 14:56.295
so they're out there somewhere.

14:56.879 --> 15:00.049
It could take forever to find three people
camping on the open range.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.719
We'll track them down
through Daniel Running Bear.

15:02.927 --> 15:04.554
Let's go see the sheriff...

15:04.929 --> 15:07.765
and find out exactly
where we can find Running Bear.

15:07.890 --> 15:12.478
Once we've found him,
I'm sure the A-Team won't be far away.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.232
Come on, Amy, I could use the help.

15:16.399 --> 15:20.153
I'm sure you could,
but I'm through being suckered by you.

15:20.236 --> 15:22.238
It's just a straight little scam.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.949
It'll go down easy,
and it'll get us everything Hannibal wants.

15:25.199 --> 15:28.453
Come on. Pretty please? Pretty?

15:28.703 --> 15:30.705
See, the brother-sister act will work great
for this.

15:30.872 --> 15:33.541
Face, what was in the grease?

15:33.916 --> 15:36.461
- I told you.
- No, you didn't tell me.

15:36.961 --> 15:38.421
I can still smell it.

15:38.755 --> 15:40.089
Well, it had a little of this...

15:40.214 --> 15:44.302
And a little of that. I know, you told me that.
But that's not enough, Face.

15:55.063 --> 15:57.607
- Come on, Amy. What do you say?
- Sorry, Face.

15:57.732 --> 16:00.777
If I told you what was in that stuff,
I'm sure you wouldn't help.

16:00.902 --> 16:01.944
What?

16:02.111 --> 16:04.906
Never mind. I'll do it on my own.

16:05.448 --> 16:08.451
Go and check with the office.
I'll meet you back here in a bit.

16:16.834 --> 16:18.920
Colonel, it's Peck!

17:14.099 --> 17:17.561
Can I try one of these on? Thanks.

17:23.025 --> 17:24.402
Where did he go?

17:48.509 --> 17:49.760
Sorry, ma'am.

17:57.101 --> 17:59.896
That's the second time he's done that to me.

18:10.406 --> 18:11.507
Thanks.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.869
I really appreciate your trusting me like that.

18:15.286 --> 18:17.413
Let's just say I liked your face.

18:18.581 --> 18:20.333
Do I have an honest face?

18:20.499 --> 18:23.169
No. But I like it.

18:29.967 --> 18:34.055
Get on the horn, Crane,
and get me the 10 best men available.

18:34.222 --> 18:35.431
Best men, sir?

18:35.556 --> 18:38.768
I'm talking about the best
marksmen that can be rounded up...

18:38.851 --> 18:40.853
and flown in here before the day is out.

18:40.978 --> 18:43.189
Yes, sir. At least we got them located.

18:43.314 --> 18:45.024
We know they're still here.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.693
They're still here.

18:47.985 --> 18:51.322
And this is gonna be the A-Team's Waterloo.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.380
You gotta be kidding.

19:08.631 --> 19:11.384
Carter's gonna be ready for us.
We need a real hole card.

19:11.467 --> 19:14.387
Considering Decker's presence
puts a damper...

19:14.470 --> 19:17.515
on most possible sources of supplies,
I think I did rather well.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.892
Look at it as a challenge, B.A.

19:20.226 --> 19:23.020
Face, I wanted an all-terrain vehicle.

19:23.145 --> 19:25.564
The important thing to remember is
we need something...

19:25.648 --> 19:27.942
that can cover the same ground as a train.

19:28.067 --> 19:31.028
The only thing this thing gonna cover
is the corner of a junkyard.

19:31.153 --> 19:33.322
Mr. Ed could teach you how to fix it, B.A.

19:34.365 --> 19:36.055
Only he's not gonna.

19:38.369 --> 19:40.371
Well, B.A., what do you think?

19:41.831 --> 19:43.499
Oh, Hannibal.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.210
How did I know
you were gonna say that?

22:52.229 --> 22:54.607
It was right around here somewhere,
wasn't it, Wesley?

22:54.690 --> 22:58.152
Just up past that bend.
You don't think they'd hit us twice, do you?

22:58.235 --> 22:59.945
I mean, two days in a row?

23:00.487 --> 23:02.323
Yeah? What's that?

23:04.283 --> 23:07.244
Here they come. Right on schedule.

23:09.371 --> 23:11.415
Don't look like they're slowing down, man.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.500
They'll slow down. They have to.

23:14.043 --> 23:15.920
You keep a full head of steam.

23:16.086 --> 23:18.422
- Are you crazy?
- I said just keep going.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.930
Son of a gun. They're not slowing down.

24:03.509 --> 24:06.011
All right, back this thing up, hurry!

24:06.804 --> 24:11.141
All right, turn those mustangs loose
or start singing Empty Saddles.

24:18.816 --> 24:20.484
B.A., bring her back!

24:36.750 --> 24:38.210
Forward, B.A.!

25:22.212 --> 25:25.507
All right, last chance. Drop your guns.

25:27.634 --> 25:31.347
Don't be shy. Come on!

25:33.182 --> 25:34.767
Go, B.A.

25:45.861 --> 25:49.198
No sneaking up from behind. Drop it.

25:56.663 --> 25:58.707
All right, open them up.

25:58.874 --> 26:00.334
You heard the man. Open it up.

26:08.217 --> 26:11.512
Let's go, B.A. Come on, Face!
Let's get out of here!

26:24.066 --> 26:25.567
Thanks for waiting.

26:29.154 --> 26:30.906
You better step on it.

26:31.073 --> 26:34.493
- I'm going as fast as I can!
- Right.

27:07.901 --> 27:10.446
I love it when a plan comes together.

27:11.530 --> 27:14.992
We're gonna have to replace
these pieces of rail, it's the only way.

27:19.746 --> 27:23.167
You guys sure do know how to make
a nuisance of yourselves, don't you?

27:23.333 --> 27:24.543
We do our best.

27:25.043 --> 27:28.589
All right, let's get to work.
Grab a length of that track...

27:28.714 --> 27:31.008
and move it over here
so we can back this train off the spur.

27:31.133 --> 27:33.927
- That's gonna take some time.
- Let's get moving, then!

27:34.094 --> 27:36.972
Last thing we need
is this train full of horses just sitting.

27:37.097 --> 27:39.558
Mr. Carter wants them out of here.
Let's do it!

27:39.683 --> 27:42.311
We'd offer to help, but...

27:43.604 --> 27:45.397
Skipper, you take a ride with me.

27:45.564 --> 27:47.774
I'm sure Mr. Carter wants
to have a few words with you.

27:47.941 --> 27:50.736
That's fine. I got a few words for him.

27:50.861 --> 27:54.318
Throw these other two in the caboose.
We'll take care of them on down the line.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.200
- Hang in there.
- Yeah, right.

27:56.450 --> 28:00.579
Don't hold your breath.
There ain't no cavalry in this picture.

28:00.662 --> 28:02.247
You keep thinking that.

28:26.355 --> 28:29.983
I'm gonna stick with Hannibal.
You guys go get some help.

28:36.031 --> 28:37.783
Where did he learn how to do that?

28:37.866 --> 28:40.244
Just like the real Range Rider.

29:03.559 --> 29:06.144
If it ain't old Buffalo Bill himself.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.689
It wouldn't do me any good
to call you names...

29:08.855 --> 29:12.109
'cause I can't imagine any name
you haven't been called before.

29:12.776 --> 29:15.696
You're a lucky man
you didn't harm my niece.

29:15.821 --> 29:19.074
Because of that,
I'm not gonna make you die slow.

29:19.616 --> 29:21.910
How long will it be
before that train's ready to roll?

29:22.035 --> 29:23.829
I told them to just keep on humping.

29:23.954 --> 29:27.791
Absolutely. I mean the last thing you need
is to get caught...

29:27.916 --> 29:32.129
with a boxcar full of stolen mustangs
attached to your own train.

29:36.049 --> 29:37.801
You tell Jesse to fire up the bird.

29:37.926 --> 29:40.804
I'm gonna shoot out there with you,
see those guys don't mess up.

29:41.179 --> 29:44.057
No telling
who else these yahoos called in.

29:44.516 --> 29:47.144
I want that train over the border into Mexico.

29:47.227 --> 29:48.770
What about him?

29:50.147 --> 29:52.441
Fertilise the south 40 with him.

29:52.608 --> 29:54.151
Have a nice day.

30:08.999 --> 30:11.376
I need a distraction.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.128
I want you to count to three.

30:13.211 --> 30:16.632
No. Count to five real slow...

30:16.757 --> 30:19.753
and then scream for all you're worth.

30:32.356 --> 30:35.901
Fire!
Help, the stable's on fire!

30:47.871 --> 30:51.124
Lane, give me my knife and my gun.

30:56.546 --> 30:58.131
Were they really going to kill you?

30:58.215 --> 31:00.634
I think that was the general idea.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.598
- What about the others?
- Right where we left them.

31:06.640 --> 31:09.685
I figured they weren't going anywhere.
Besides, I had to come for you.

31:09.976 --> 31:11.770
Good idea. Let's go.

31:11.895 --> 31:13.230
Take care of Whacko for me.

31:13.313 --> 31:15.899
- That's Waco, Murdock.
- Waco.

31:35.335 --> 31:38.422
<i>After you get those horses
to Mexico, go find that Indian.</i>

31:38.547 --> 31:40.799
<i>Make sure he don't hire any more help.</i>

31:47.305 --> 31:49.933
The sheriff?
I thought those guys were wanted.

31:50.225 --> 31:52.436
I think we should try to swing
by the reservation.

31:52.519 --> 31:55.397
Maybe we can pick up
a bunch of the guys who'll help.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.401
And if not, then we'd be wasting time.
I wanna head straight for the sheriff's.

31:59.568 --> 32:01.903
My worry is keeping those guys
from being killed.

32:02.070 --> 32:04.030
Hannibal can always find a way to escape.

32:04.239 --> 32:07.200
That sounds like the way
Hannibal would think.

32:08.702 --> 32:10.245
Holy...

32:25.427 --> 32:28.180
How lucky for me,
running into you like this.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.056
I don't understand.

32:30.474 --> 32:32.642
You are Daniel Running Bear,
aren't you?

32:33.310 --> 32:34.352
Why do you ask?

32:34.519 --> 32:38.356
Your license plate.
And I have a description of this vehicle.

32:39.608 --> 32:41.818
I'm Col. Decker of the U.S. Army.

32:41.943 --> 32:43.904
I've been trying to reach you
at home all day.

32:43.987 --> 32:46.448
I finally decided to drive up
to speak with you.

32:46.531 --> 32:49.367
Good thing, too,
or we might have missed each other again.

32:49.493 --> 32:51.328
I have a lot of important things
to take care of...

32:51.453 --> 32:52.746
So do I.

32:53.330 --> 32:56.166
I want to know where the A-Team is.

32:56.792 --> 33:00.128
- The A-Team?
- Yes. I'm sure you can tell me.

33:00.253 --> 33:02.923
If not, I feel certain Miss Allen can.

33:03.048 --> 33:05.842
And I'm prepared to stand here all week.

33:13.016 --> 33:18.104
I hope you yahoos enjoy
your little trip, courtesy Carter Railways.

33:18.313 --> 33:22.192
Unfortunately, though,
there ain't no return tickets.

33:22.359 --> 33:24.945
I've always wanted
to see the country by rail.

33:31.535 --> 33:35.330
Get rid of them guys. We don't want
any outlaw witnesses on board.

33:35.872 --> 33:39.501
All right, the rest of you
head on back. Let's get some work done.

33:39.626 --> 33:42.003
We've still got some steers
need branding.

33:42.462 --> 33:46.758
And when you get across the border,
adiós, yahoos.

34:37.016 --> 34:38.393
Go!

35:07.714 --> 35:10.800
Will you hold still? You're gonna rub me raw
with these little ropes.

35:11.009 --> 35:12.677
I ain't moving, it's the train moving.

35:12.802 --> 35:16.556
Boy, that's great. That's just what we need,
an Abbott and Costello routine.

35:58.431 --> 35:59.641
Where are you going?

35:59.766 --> 36:02.143
You don't stop, no matter what.
You got that?

37:25.602 --> 37:29.647
Boy, you must be getting real weak.
You can't break these puny little ropes.

37:36.321 --> 37:38.198
I was just kidding.

37:39.157 --> 37:42.077
B.A., grab that brake wheel.
We gotta stop this train.

37:46.706 --> 37:48.083
Coming to the border.

37:48.291 --> 37:50.877
If those mustangs get into Mexico,
we got no evidence.

38:02.597 --> 38:04.349
Good job, B.A.

38:10.271 --> 38:11.815
There's Murdock.

38:14.442 --> 38:17.195
- B.A.?
- Nighty-night.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.546
- Face, take my hat for a minute.
- Sure.

38:34.629 --> 38:36.047
B.A., give me your hand.

38:43.972 --> 38:47.517
Hannibal, we got a bogey at 11:00.

38:51.187 --> 38:52.480
Come on.

38:54.149 --> 38:56.526
Adiós, bonanza.

39:16.723 --> 39:18.683
Hannibal, come on, let's go!

39:18.703 --> 39:21.634
- He's not close enough!
- What? Are you crazy?

39:22.468 --> 39:26.598
I wouldn't sleep at all tonight
if he didn't see the expression on my face.

39:26.750 --> 39:29.434
- Hannibal!
- Hannibal!

39:38.067 --> 39:40.278
Time's a-wasting, partner.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.490
So long, pal.

40:13.144 --> 40:16.105
- Told you he'd do it.
- That's right.

40:17.857 --> 40:21.194
I think there's something real interesting
you'd like to know about that train.

40:21.277 --> 40:24.822
It's used to move out wild mustangs
off the reservation illegally.

40:25.198 --> 40:28.076
And I think
this gentleman has a lot to answer for.

40:28.493 --> 40:31.037
I do believe that's a federal offense,
isn't it, Colonel?

40:31.204 --> 40:32.872
Yes, ma'am, it is.

40:36.918 --> 40:40.922
Next time, Hannibal Smith. Next time.

41:05.154 --> 41:08.491
Look at them. It's like they know
they aren't being hunted anymore.

41:08.783 --> 41:10.410
How great to be free.

41:10.535 --> 41:14.038
We gotta get going before Decker finds out
we never left the county.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.791
You know, even though he doesn't have
anything positive on me...

41:16.958 --> 41:20.795
you can bet he'll probably have me under
constant surveillance when I get home.

41:21.004 --> 41:23.089
So I thought maybe I'd stay here a while.

41:23.256 --> 41:25.758
- Gather a little background material?
- Something like that.

41:25.883 --> 41:30.096
Then if Amy'll loan us her car, I guess
we can give you a ride to Phoenix Airport.

41:30.221 --> 41:31.306
Great.

41:37.228 --> 41:38.479
Here, B.A.

41:38.563 --> 41:42.608
That's so you can show them
to the kids in your class.

41:42.775 --> 41:45.028
Help them understand better...

41:45.903 --> 41:47.363
so they can make one.

41:47.488 --> 41:51.492
Thanks, little brother. I'm sure the kids
at my daycare centre will love the gift.

41:51.701 --> 41:53.578
- Okay.
- So long.

41:59.625 --> 42:04.756
Daniel, will you say goodbye to Ed for me?

42:04.881 --> 42:08.009
And will you tell him
that if he ever needs me...

42:08.134 --> 42:12.138
if he ever feels the need to talk to anyone...

42:12.680 --> 42:14.390
that I'll always lend an ear?

42:14.557 --> 42:17.518
Good. 'Cause you ain't got no brains.

42:17.935 --> 42:19.270
Sure, Murdock.

42:31.616 --> 42:33.034
They really did it.

42:33.284 --> 42:35.161
They always do.

42:36.537 --> 42:37.872
Here, buckaroo.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.880
Hey, he forgot his mask.

42:46.047 --> 42:48.132
No, he didn't forget his mask.

42:48.925 --> 42:53.596
He just left it behind
because his job here is done.
