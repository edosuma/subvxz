00:00.080 --> 00:02.200
We're supposed to sit here
pissing in our pants

00:02.320 --> 00:04.215
while you decide our future, is that it?

00:04.376 --> 00:08.010
Why should the American taxpayers
support a lab that's in Toronto, Canada?

00:08.172 --> 00:10.722
Science is on the verge
of unlocking the secrets of life,

00:10.883 --> 00:13.660
and you're thinking about amputating
the only organization

00:13.780 --> 00:16.018
that's actually minding the store!
You're insane!

00:16.180 --> 00:18.480
How did you get this appointment?

00:18.641 --> 00:22.358
I slept with you for 25 years.
I suppose something rubbed off.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.378
Rachel.

00:24.544 --> 00:27.100
What we're doing...
I'm a little concerned.

00:27.220 --> 00:31.242
This thing that Carl is working on,
the magnetobacteria? It is insanity.

00:31.403 --> 00:34.579
You're worried about this...
magnetobacteria?

00:35.372 --> 00:38.541
I'm worried about somebody getting
a bullet in the back of the head.

00:38.873 --> 00:40.692
So bacteria forms a biofilm?

00:40.812 --> 00:42.879
Yes, but take a look at them
when we zoom in.

00:44.264 --> 00:46.508
- Like they're marching in formation.
- Precisely.

00:46.669 --> 00:48.510
Working together
to gum up the circuit board.

00:48.671 --> 00:49.844
As if programmed.

00:50.005 --> 00:53.297
I have high inter-ocular pressure
and an increased cup-to-disk ratio.

00:53.417 --> 00:55.934
The optic nerve in both eyes
is degenerating.

00:56.095 --> 00:58.311
I'm going blind, David. I'm sorry.

00:58.472 --> 01:01.606
We've been studying ways to repair
optic nerve damage for several years.

01:02.701 --> 01:05.860
However, when the procedure fails,
our test subjects

01:06.156 --> 01:08.279
are left totally blind.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.990
I don't want to do it, David.

01:11.722 --> 01:12.826
But I have to.

01:14.810 --> 01:17.288
All right, Bob, you can open them.

01:24.473 --> 01:25.547
I can see.

01:26.227 --> 01:28.199
Dr. Melnikov, Dr. Tran.

01:29.721 --> 01:32.715
- He was terrified.
- I didn't get that impression.

01:33.721 --> 01:34.982
It was obvious to me.

01:35.102 --> 01:38.146
People are talking.
They think you're acting differently,

01:38.471 --> 01:40.124
like you're, you know...

01:40.485 --> 01:42.638
more sensitive to their emotions.

01:42.974 --> 01:45.082
I don't know what's going on, David.

01:45.202 --> 01:47.318
All I do know
is that I don't want it to stop.

01:47.438 --> 01:50.499
I think some of the virus
traveled in the wrong direction,

01:50.735 --> 01:53.546
up the repaired optic nerve,
into Bob's brain

01:53.666 --> 01:55.660
and in particular
into his Jacobson's Organ.

01:56.583 --> 02:00.846
- He's smelling emotions.
- That would mean that Dr. Melnikov has

02:00.966 --> 02:04.777
genetically evolved
into a higher state of being.

02:04.897 --> 02:08.006
- Why would he just up and leave?
- Maybe somebody took him.

02:08.167 --> 02:10.604
- Do you know Olivier Roth?
- Of course I do.

02:10.725 --> 02:14.206
I never met him, but in the financial
circles he was with Buffet and Gates.

02:14.326 --> 02:16.975
Yeah, well, I think he's responsible
for magnetobacteria

02:17.095 --> 02:19.893
and I think he's kidnapped Bob,
so tell us where we can find him.

02:20.204 --> 02:22.607
We will change humanity,

02:22.727 --> 02:24.606
evolve the species.

02:24.767 --> 02:28.443
Listen to me, Roth, you son of a bitch.
You do anything to Bob, I'll find you.

02:28.604 --> 02:31.105
- See you in the future, David.
- Roth!

02:31.225 --> 02:35.283
You, Dr. Melnikov,
encompass the only hope we have left.

02:35.869 --> 02:38.578
A man
who truly understands the compassion,

02:39.135 --> 02:41.873
the hopes, the fears of his fellow man.

02:42.034 --> 02:44.292
Within you, in a stem cell

02:44.593 --> 02:46.002
in your brain,

02:46.163 --> 02:48.087
lies the future of mankind.

Please...

04:28.937 --> 04:30.229
don't hurt me.

04:34.220 --> 04:35.900
My head hurts.

04:38.386 --> 04:40.483
I want to talk to David.

- I need another 24 hours.
- What you said 24 hours ago.

06:36.968 --> 06:38.910
The Mexican authorities
have not given us...

06:39.030 --> 06:41.086
I don't give a shit
about the Mexican authorities!

06:41.206 --> 06:43.405
This is a TB outbreak.
It has nothing to do with...

06:43.525 --> 06:46.711
- Doctors Without Borders said it was...
- They've been kicked out.

06:46.831 --> 06:49.662
- The same thing will happen to you.
- No, we have a contact.

06:49.823 --> 06:52.872
A medic who can get us across
the Zapatista lines and keep us safe.

06:52.992 --> 06:54.260
- Are we going?
- Yes.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.060
Call Rico, tell him we're on our way.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.963
They have been delivering
ultimatums to the Mexican government.

06:59.123 --> 07:01.874
For medical aid! People are dying
because they're not getting supplies.

07:01.994 --> 07:03.926
They're turning Chiapas
into a state of war.

07:04.087 --> 07:06.432
The Zapatistas say the same thing
about the Mexican army

07:06.552 --> 07:08.438
Fuck the politics. We're going, Wes.

07:08.558 --> 07:11.225
Riddlemeyer
has a new priority for us in Illinois.

07:11.345 --> 07:14.887
I want you to remind Riddlemeyer
that his only priority is to find Bob.

07:15.007 --> 07:18.149
That's the deal we made.
That's why his ass isn't in jail.

07:18.310 --> 07:19.400
Tell him yourself.

07:19.561 --> 07:20.574
David?

07:23.379 --> 07:25.629
Division of Health.
They're worried about hepatitis.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.014
Give it to Rachel.

07:27.134 --> 07:28.970
- OK.
- Not that I'm asking,

07:29.090 --> 07:32.228
but could you find out what
Riddlemeyer's priority in Illinois is?

07:36.868 --> 07:39.670
- What?
- I think you just got a new priority.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.226
He's in a coma?

07:53.947 --> 07:56.229
- His doctor induced it.
- Why?

07:56.985 --> 07:59.982
They're concerned about swelling
on his brain. Maybe an infection.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.320
David, he was operated on.

08:05.358 --> 08:06.989
On his brain? Why?

08:07.150 --> 08:08.908
They're not sure.

08:10.785 --> 08:12.185
What can we do?

08:12.305 --> 08:14.872
Nothing. He's in the best possible care.

08:16.701 --> 08:19.293
- I want to be here when he wakes up.
- Of course.

08:20.472 --> 08:23.131
But that's not going to happen
for about 5 days.

08:24.836 --> 08:26.030
We should go.

08:28.474 --> 08:29.345
David?

08:30.594 --> 08:33.390
Just gimme a minute, OK?
I'll meet you down in the lobby.

08:33.552 --> 08:34.725
I'll get a taxi.

08:45.099 --> 08:46.070
Hey, Bob.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.786
Did you have a good three months off?

08:56.782 --> 09:00.275
If you're gonna disappear like that,
the least you could do is send me a...

09:16.761 --> 09:18.155
I'll be right back.

09:27.479 --> 09:28.279
David,

09:29.053 --> 09:31.949
I'd like to introduce you
to Olivier Roth.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.827
- Dr. Sandström.
- Son of a bitch! What did you do?

09:34.988 --> 09:36.787
Just listen to what he has to say.

09:39.075 --> 09:41.807
- What are you doing here?
- I've enormous respect for Dr. Melnikov

09:41.927 --> 09:44.647
- and his accomplishments.
- You mean his Jacobson's Organ.

09:44.767 --> 09:47.423
- You harvested his stem cells.
- At his insistence.

09:47.584 --> 09:49.300
You took advantage of him.

09:49.799 --> 09:52.094
Bob is a brilliant scientist.
And a friend.

09:53.005 --> 09:56.630
Unfortunately, his work to awaken
the Jacobson's Organ in others

09:56.750 --> 09:58.684
- was unsuccessful.
- No shit.

09:58.845 --> 10:01.187
- When I heard he was injured...
- You cut a hole in his head.

10:01.348 --> 10:03.564
I wanted to make sure
he had everything he needed.

10:04.512 --> 10:05.983
I'm telling you the truth.

10:06.984 --> 10:10.339
I'm sorry if you feel I'm some kind
of diabolical menace to humanity,

10:10.459 --> 10:13.101
Excuse me. You tried
to send the world back to the stone age

10:13.221 --> 10:14.533
with your magnetobacteria.

10:16.487 --> 10:19.997
Everything you need to know.
How to make it. How to kill it.

10:20.598 --> 10:24.168
And I assure you,
all other samples have been destroyed.

10:24.329 --> 10:26.246
Where was this file three months ago?

10:26.366 --> 10:28.965
Three months ago, Homeland Security
received the same package

10:29.690 --> 10:30.925
from Mr. Roth.

10:36.228 --> 10:37.423
What are you doing?

10:37.543 --> 10:40.434
You're working on a Zombie army
to take over the world?

10:42.521 --> 10:45.831
I am not the enemy here, Dr. Sandström.

10:47.143 --> 10:49.131
Thank you, Carl.
If there's anything I can do.

10:49.251 --> 10:52.788
I'll make sure you get any updates
on Bob's condition when we have them.

10:53.260 --> 10:54.627
Dr. Sandström.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.666
That's it? He just walks away?

11:04.789 --> 11:05.876
That's it.

11:08.094 --> 11:09.577
- Where are you going?
- Mexico.

11:09.697 --> 11:12.853
People are dying there from
an antibiotic resistant strain of TB.

11:12.973 --> 11:16.750
- I want you in Hudson Point, Illinois.
- And I want Oliver Roth in prison.

11:16.870 --> 11:20.007
I guess sometimes
you just can't get what you want.

11:20.913 --> 11:23.984
I've been receiving calls
from a Congressman Kirchner.

11:24.104 --> 11:26.925
The people in his district,
that's Hudson Point,

11:27.045 --> 11:30.574
have temporarily lost
the ability to feel any pain.

11:30.694 --> 11:31.512
Lucky them.

11:31.632 --> 11:34.144
They inflict horrific injuries
on themselves without realizing it...

11:34.264 --> 11:36.699
In Chiapas,
there are over a million people at risk.

11:36.859 --> 11:38.326
We need to figure out a way

11:38.487 --> 11:40.870
to contain and kill it
before it's knocking on our back door.

11:41.031 --> 11:43.165
This community is near panic.
We have to do something.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.911
- Rachel and Mayko can manage it.
- I want you to manage it!

11:46.031 --> 11:48.181
Fine. When I'm back from Mexico.

11:59.575 --> 12:00.395
Fuck.

12:04.606 --> 12:06.692
- Hello, David.
- We're on our way to Chiapas.

12:06.812 --> 12:08.606
I need Rachel. Where the hell is she?

12:09.763 --> 12:11.649
I don't know. What's going on?

12:12.108 --> 12:14.548
Get her on a flight
with Mayko to Hudson Point, Illinois.

12:14.668 --> 12:15.634
Alright.

12:15.833 --> 12:19.582
I've got my Sat Phone. Any change in
Bob's condition, good or bad... call me.

12:19.702 --> 12:21.560
- Got it.
- Tell Rachel from now on

12:21.680 --> 12:25.627
she's to have her cell phone
on and in her pocket at all times.

12:25.878 --> 12:27.266
Good night, David.

13:11.560 --> 13:14.754
- Chiapas no possible.
- We're from NorBAC... Chiapas possible.

13:24.675 --> 13:27.643
Here's some very complicated
English for ya: Go fuck yourself.

13:28.131 --> 13:29.603
You go fuck yourself.

13:32.933 --> 13:35.609
You were right.
He's not going to let us through.

13:35.939 --> 13:37.436
It's always the same.

13:37.556 --> 13:40.114
The bigger the hat,
the smaller the brain.

13:41.223 --> 13:42.079
So...

13:43.831 --> 13:45.286
What do we do now?

13:45.643 --> 13:48.956
Like I said at the airport,
I'll get you to where you want to go.

13:49.416 --> 13:52.835
There are just so many army checkpoints
and many more miles of Chiapas border.

14:25.690 --> 14:26.493
Mayko!

14:26.765 --> 14:28.269
Cab's here. We gotta go.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.651
Found an interesting case in Pakistan.

14:31.184 --> 14:33.109
Three related families with a mutation

14:33.229 --> 14:37.398
in the SCN9A nerve cell channel that
gives them an insensitivity to pain.

14:37.518 --> 14:41.117
- They worked as circus freaks.
- I doubt this is a genetic mutation.

14:41.237 --> 14:43.620
From what I've read,
this thing in Illinois

14:43.740 --> 14:45.846
seems to be a transitory condition.

14:46.006 --> 14:48.373
Maybe something temporarily
blocking the nerve channel?

14:48.493 --> 14:51.199
I'm thinking it may even be
a virus in the nerve fibre.

14:51.319 --> 14:53.346
But have you ever seen
anything like that?

14:53.466 --> 14:55.182
Around here, no, but...

14:55.909 --> 14:57.191
What's WTF?

14:57.933 --> 14:58.917
WTF?

14:59.520 --> 15:01.487
The initials on your bag. WTF.

15:04.315 --> 15:06.415
- Wes loaned it to me.
- Oh, yeah?

15:06.535 --> 15:09.125
Yeah. It was there.
He said I could use it.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.186
- There?
- Yeah, there.

15:13.659 --> 15:15.310
Anything we need to do?

15:15.573 --> 15:16.396
No.

15:37.412 --> 15:39.638
- What'd you give him?
- Cocaine.

16:00.662 --> 16:02.863
There's a white flag in the back.

16:02.983 --> 16:03.979
Tie it up.

16:18.304 --> 16:20.788
This is so the Chiapas know who we are.

17:13.721 --> 17:15.737
I gotta fucking learn Spanish.

17:42.046 --> 17:43.733
What's that? Corn Days?

17:44.764 --> 17:46.443
It's the American way.

17:47.565 --> 17:50.120
- You celebrate what you've got.
- Corn?

17:52.416 --> 17:55.097
There is a town in Colorado
that celebrates a chicken

17:55.217 --> 17:57.136
who lived for three months
without a head.

17:57.256 --> 17:59.266
- What?
- I swear to God.

17:59.892 --> 18:01.524
- A headless chicken.
- Oh, God.

18:01.644 --> 18:02.527
Imagine.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.276
Painful stimuli are produced

18:05.396 --> 18:07.736
by electrical impulses
in your nerve cells.

18:07.916 --> 18:11.859
These impulses travel from nociceptive
dorsal root ganglion neurons

18:11.979 --> 18:13.867
originating in the body's periphery,

18:13.987 --> 18:16.181
through ascending spinal pathways
to the brain.

18:16.865 --> 18:19.582
- You can sit wherever you like.
- We're actually from...

18:19.702 --> 18:22.229
Doctor,
my family grows corn and soybeans.

18:22.389 --> 18:23.680
We're not scientists.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.965
All we want to know
is why this thing here is happening.

18:27.302 --> 18:29.022
Ion channels in the nerve cells,

18:29.142 --> 18:32.197
including many types of sodium channels,
produce these nerve impulses.

18:32.357 --> 18:33.282
Hold on.

18:34.318 --> 18:36.373
Ion channels? What are they?

18:37.492 --> 18:40.061
Stimulation of the nerve cells
produces small changes.

18:40.181 --> 18:43.152
The ion channel amplify small changes,
and at a certain threshold,

18:43.272 --> 18:45.519
the neuron fires
and a signal is sent back to the brain.

18:45.639 --> 18:48.213
- And that's how you know...
- The signal is transmitted by

18:48.373 --> 18:50.240
A-delta fibres to the spinal cord

18:50.360 --> 18:52.385
and then to a sorting station
in the thalamus.

18:52.505 --> 18:55.474
When the signal is relayed
to the somatosensory cortex...

18:56.427 --> 18:59.015
Why'd Mitchell Hayes's daughter
nearly take her eye out?

18:59.177 --> 19:02.249
I'd like to know why Washington
sent a fella like you here.

19:02.429 --> 19:04.980
Are you trying to cover up
for some kind of government screw-up?

19:05.291 --> 19:07.416
That's ridiculous.
Can we get back to the basics here?

19:07.536 --> 19:11.737
The basics are that we don't know
what the hell is happening around here!

19:11.857 --> 19:13.280
The "ouch"...

19:13.440 --> 19:15.157
is nature's way of protecting us.

19:15.317 --> 19:17.284
I'm so sorry to interrupt here, Doctor.

19:17.444 --> 19:20.116
Hi, I'm Rachel Woods
and this is Mayko Tran.

19:20.236 --> 19:23.755
We're here from the North American
Biotechnology Advisory Commission.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.630
- How are you doing?
- Good, thanks.

19:25.750 --> 19:29.337
Hopefully we can simplify
this a little for you folks.

19:29.498 --> 19:31.672
- Be my guests.
- Okay.

19:31.983 --> 19:33.160
Wanna do the work?

19:33.280 --> 19:37.517
So, the thing about pain is
it produces this, like, electrical zap.

19:38.016 --> 19:39.640
When you poke yourself with a pin,

19:39.800 --> 19:41.581
you react within a tenth of a second.

19:41.701 --> 19:44.698
You pull your hand away from
that pin before your brain even has time

19:44.818 --> 19:47.568
to figure out what's going on.
That's the "ouch."

19:47.957 --> 19:50.947
It's basically ancient hard wiring
for self-preservation.

19:51.067 --> 19:52.633
That's the fast pain signals.

19:52.813 --> 19:55.124
And they call it that
because they're really fast.

19:55.244 --> 19:57.991
So that's what's not working
in these people?

19:58.151 --> 19:59.888
That's what we're gonna try to find out.

20:00.008 --> 20:03.205
So you're coming in here thinking that
this has to do with the ion channels?

20:03.715 --> 20:05.113
All right, you know what?

20:05.233 --> 20:07.330
That's a possibility.
Let me tell you what those are.

20:07.450 --> 20:09.837
There are these structures,
on nerve cells,

20:09.997 --> 20:13.175
that sense pain. They're like
these little gates that open and close.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.324
So if these gates aren't
opening and closing properly,

20:16.640 --> 20:20.382
then that can screw up that pain zap
before it even gets to the brain.

20:20.502 --> 20:24.793
So, amplify it, turn it down
or block it completely.

20:25.037 --> 20:27.597
So why are these gates closing on us?

20:27.717 --> 20:30.231
Why aren't these people
feeling anything?

20:30.392 --> 20:34.639
We just got here 15 minutes ago.
Maybe if we can have another 24 hours,

20:35.844 --> 20:38.031
- we might have some answers.
- Okay, but...

20:38.191 --> 20:41.092
- we gotta have answers pretty quick.
- I know.

20:54.915 --> 20:56.800
How do I know you're not spies?

21:00.111 --> 21:02.561
Your accent... you're from Mexico City.

21:03.018 --> 21:05.191
Surely Rico told you we were coming.

21:05.311 --> 21:07.769
He has, but I didn't expect
a <i>chilango</i> from up north.

21:09.318 --> 21:10.865
We're here to help.

21:11.450 --> 21:13.768
- Why should I believe you?
- Check our gear...

21:13.888 --> 21:17.279
TB is caused
by a bacterial microorganism,

21:17.634 --> 21:20.989
the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>,
and it's spread by droplet infection.

21:21.109 --> 21:23.118
If a patient exhales, coughs or sneezes,

21:23.278 --> 21:25.304
tubercle bacilli are released
into the air.

21:25.424 --> 21:27.351
There is a gene, N-RAMP1,

21:27.471 --> 21:30.292
which is involved in a person
having a susceptibility to leprosy,

21:30.452 --> 21:33.497
and it's also caused
by a bacterium related to TB.

21:34.118 --> 21:37.289
What do you think,
are we spies or scientists?

21:39.378 --> 21:40.219
Go on.

21:41.870 --> 21:43.538
We understand from the reports we got

21:43.658 --> 21:46.058
that there's a high mortality rate
with this outbreak.

21:46.218 --> 21:49.019
32 have died from this.
Hundreds are sick.

21:49.568 --> 21:51.980
There's been some question
as to the diagnosis,

21:52.140 --> 21:55.445
because this disease isn't responding
to any of the first line TB treatments.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.588
First line?

21:56.708 --> 21:58.487
The latest and greatest in antibiotics.

21:58.647 --> 22:00.614
But it is TB. Doctors confirmed that

22:00.774 --> 22:02.837
before Mexico City
ordered them out of Chiapas.

22:02.957 --> 22:06.075
We've brought diagnostic gear,
a portable x-ray machine and...

22:06.195 --> 22:07.746
the latest in tiered treatments.

22:07.906 --> 22:10.207
We'll ID this strain,
contain it and kill it.

22:15.129 --> 22:16.630
If there is anything you need...

22:17.856 --> 22:19.716
I'll have my men provide it to you.

22:22.822 --> 22:26.621
It's not an easy problem to communicate.
I'm glad they sent in reinforcements.

22:26.741 --> 22:29.893
We're actually gonna be doing
specimen collection, fieldwork.

22:30.053 --> 22:32.761
You should be visiting people
in the hospital. It's pretty rough.

22:32.881 --> 22:34.741
- You've seen pictures?
- No.

22:34.861 --> 22:35.991
Oh, well...

22:48.850 --> 22:49.675
Jesus.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.583
- Oh, dear.
- Yeah.

22:55.121 --> 22:56.378
They get worse.

22:56.538 --> 22:57.954
Oh, my God.

23:04.026 --> 23:05.820
Lola, how're you doing?

23:05.980 --> 23:07.088
I'm fine.

23:09.660 --> 23:11.983
- Doesn't hurt much?
- Not at all.

23:12.379 --> 23:16.148
It was like a switch being thrown.
She felt fine, no problems.

23:16.710 --> 23:18.501
Two hours later
I get a call from the school

23:18.621 --> 23:20.851
saying she'd done this to her eye.

23:21.062 --> 23:21.945
Okay.

23:22.337 --> 23:24.990
- How about that?
- I can feel you touching my foot.

23:25.541 --> 23:27.930
Okay, let's try the other foot.
Let's see.

23:29.833 --> 23:31.413
There. Any sensation?

23:31.573 --> 23:32.998
It kind of tickles.

23:34.028 --> 23:36.918
Hey. I've got cerebro-spinals
from all the active patients,

23:37.078 --> 23:38.599
- so I'll be in the lab.
- OK.

23:38.719 --> 23:41.499
Okay. I think we're done here.
Thank you, Lola.

23:41.619 --> 23:44.223
Could you hang tight for a second? Okay.

23:46.994 --> 23:49.431
They say with most people
this passes in a few days.

23:49.884 --> 23:51.415
What if it doesn't?

23:51.927 --> 23:55.145
Let's not go there.
Give us some time to look into it.

23:57.334 --> 23:59.327
- How's it going?
- Hey.

23:59.487 --> 24:02.652
Spinal fluids slightly elevated,
white blood cells levels

24:02.812 --> 24:05.909
- and slightly decreased glucose levels.
- Some kind of inflammation?

24:06.029 --> 24:08.742
I don't know. I need to get
these samples back to NorBAC.

24:08.902 --> 24:11.056
I got
a lot of environmental sampling to do,

24:11.176 --> 24:13.672
so I will be out with the corn and pigs.

24:21.949 --> 24:23.896
Where did the outbreak begin?

24:24.703 --> 24:27.249
At first the sick ones
were all Zapatista militia,

24:27.369 --> 24:29.262
then it jumped
to the women and children.

24:29.422 --> 24:32.265
- I need all your data on the scatter.
- What's that?

24:32.425 --> 24:33.681
Who got sick when.

24:33.801 --> 24:36.189
The ones who were treated
by the doctors before they left

24:36.309 --> 24:38.157
have files, the others, no.

24:38.476 --> 24:40.348
Okay. "Importito".

24:40.558 --> 24:42.760
First things first.
We need an exclusion zone.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.194
All right? Right here.

24:44.894 --> 24:47.697
- Why aren't these people wearing masks?
- We ran out.

24:47.857 --> 24:50.784
Well, I've seen no shortage of bandanas.

24:51.489 --> 24:53.637
David, their breathing's moist,
restricted.

24:53.757 --> 24:56.998
Get some hoark samples to look at
under a microscope. I'll run a PCR.

24:58.526 --> 25:01.169
I'm going to need to do chest X-rays.
Do you have electricity?

25:01.330 --> 25:03.959
The <i>Federales</i> cut our power a month ago,
but I can get a generator.

25:04.079 --> 25:06.383
We should start inoculating
all the children in the village.

25:06.543 --> 25:07.926
What about my soldiers?

25:08.320 --> 25:11.430
It's not as effective in adults,
but yeah, it's worth a try.

25:11.590 --> 25:15.016
- Your people know how to vaccinate?
- If you show them, they will learn.

25:21.433 --> 25:23.400
Your shawl, over your mouth.

25:41.228 --> 25:44.629
These white spots indicate
concentrations of infection.

25:44.789 --> 25:48.063
We're going to need to culture
the bacteria at NorBAC

25:48.183 --> 25:50.136
and try to positive
the ID of the strain.

25:50.256 --> 25:51.866
How long will that take?

25:51.986 --> 25:53.305
Two to three weeks.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.016
TB grows very slowly in the lab.

25:56.176 --> 25:59.093
- What do we do in the meantime?
- Make sure the sick stay quarantined.

25:59.213 --> 26:01.315
We need to contain the outbreak.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.793
We need to check all of your men,
their wives, children.

26:03.913 --> 26:06.443
Any symptoms of TB
and they need to be brought here.

26:06.603 --> 26:08.306
They won't leave their land.

26:08.426 --> 26:11.031
- Especially if a <i>chilango</i> tells them.
- They're gonna have to.

26:11.191 --> 26:13.355
They have been oppressed
for generations,

26:13.475 --> 26:16.077
forced off their land
by corporations and corrupt governments.

26:16.237 --> 26:17.545
Let me put it this way.

26:17.665 --> 26:20.081
This TB we're dealing with,
it's a hell of a lot worse

26:20.241 --> 26:21.833
than any corrupt government.

26:22.989 --> 26:25.295
It won't be easy to convince
the people of Chiapas.

26:43.138 --> 26:44.514
Can I help you, ma'am?

26:44.724 --> 26:46.266
No, I'm okay, thanks.

26:46.386 --> 26:48.794
Well, you know,
that's our field you're in.

26:48.914 --> 26:50.070
Oh, sorry!

26:50.399 --> 26:53.517
I'm investigating
a public health problem.

26:53.637 --> 26:55.742
All these people hurting themselves?

26:55.902 --> 26:57.634
I guess you know all about it, yeah.

26:57.754 --> 27:00.322
One of our farmhands actually got
third degree burns.

27:00.442 --> 27:02.707
He leaned his butt up against
a red-hot tractor manifold.

27:02.867 --> 27:06.047
- Ed Koskey!
- So, you do know what's going on.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.369
Well, sort of.

27:07.655 --> 27:09.642
- Tom Gleason.
- Hi. Mayko Tran.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.596
Hey. So, what are you hoping to find?

27:13.485 --> 27:15.220
Well, right now we don't

27:15.380 --> 27:19.014
really know, we're looking for toxins
in the soil, water.

27:19.134 --> 27:21.977
We've got a lot of grunt work to do
before we're gonna have any answers.

27:22.137 --> 27:25.188
I don't know if it's any help,
but we've been organic for 5 years now.

27:25.348 --> 27:28.066
- No chemicals whatsoever?
- Just botanical insecticides.

27:28.226 --> 27:30.527
Advantageous bacteria
like <i>B. thuringiensis</i>,

27:30.687 --> 27:32.517
<i>S. spinosa</i>, that sort of thing.

27:32.637 --> 27:33.911
So you're...

27:34.615 --> 27:35.907
you're all-natural?

27:36.067 --> 27:37.075
Absolutely.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.952
We got this really cool new one.

27:40.072 --> 27:41.705
It's completely non-toxic.

27:41.865 --> 27:43.832
It's called Rowinall. See that there?

27:44.326 --> 27:46.459
- That stuff?
- It actually repels pests.

27:46.579 --> 27:48.086
Except guys like me, of course.

27:49.596 --> 27:51.673
Though it doesn't last so long, so

27:51.833 --> 27:54.250
it got me thinking we should go back
to using <i>Gliocladium</i>,

27:54.370 --> 27:57.971
that does a hell of a number on pythium
and fusarium rot, that sort of thing.

27:58.547 --> 28:02.498
- Sorry. Am I going too fast for you?
- Kind of. Could you... just...

28:04.556 --> 28:06.479
Oh yeah, sure. Not a problem.

28:07.593 --> 28:08.699
Thanks.

28:09.275 --> 28:11.818
<i>S. spinosa</i>, which is <i>Saccharo-</i>

28:12.028 --> 28:14.595
<i>-poly-spora spinosa</i>.

28:16.065 --> 28:18.785
Takes care of your caterpillars,

28:19.981 --> 28:21.536
sawfly larvae,

28:21.696 --> 28:24.914
thrips, Colorado potato beetle,

28:25.865 --> 28:27.215
your fire ant...

28:27.880 --> 28:30.161
God, those are nasty little buggers.

28:31.689 --> 28:32.809
All righty?

28:34.539 --> 28:36.509
- Cool, thank you.
- Okay.

28:36.992 --> 28:38.011
So I'll see ya.

28:38.171 --> 28:40.519
- Yeah. Thanks so much.
- Good luck.

28:41.953 --> 28:44.934
Take all the samples you want.
My field is your field.

28:45.094 --> 28:46.742
That's awesome, thanks.

28:47.724 --> 28:48.533
Bye.

28:50.016 --> 28:51.933
Organize the cases chronologically.

28:52.143 --> 28:54.464
Put them on a map.
We need to find Patient Zero.

28:54.584 --> 28:56.755
- Patient Zero?
- The person who brought it here

28:56.875 --> 28:58.716
and may be spreading it somewhere else.

28:58.836 --> 29:01.280
- We need to contain it.
- I'll check in with the lab.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.246
Okay.

29:05.462 --> 29:06.438
Carlos.

29:07.084 --> 29:07.902
Hey.

29:08.022 --> 29:10.608
I never got a chance to thank you
for coming down here.

29:11.222 --> 29:14.172
It's really not necessary.
The situation down here is intolerable.

29:14.630 --> 29:17.509
We'll keep you safe and protected
from the <i>Federales</i>.

29:21.755 --> 29:24.049
Cell phones don't really work down here.

29:24.814 --> 29:26.397
This is a Sat phone.

29:27.312 --> 29:31.014
I can communicate with anyone
anywhere in the world via Globalvox.

29:31.380 --> 29:33.818
And I just hope to find
a pen that works.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.854
We come from very different worlds,
you and I.

29:40.469 --> 29:41.815
Maybe not so different.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.946
I'd better get back to work.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.830
Organize these cases.

30:01.990 --> 30:04.088
Put them on a map.
We need to find Patient Zero.

30:04.349 --> 30:06.607
- Patient Zero?
- The person who brought this here

30:06.727 --> 30:09.689
and may be spreading it someplace else.
We need to make sure it's contained.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.782
- I'll check in with the lab.
- Okay.

30:22.447 --> 30:23.206
So,

30:24.247 --> 30:25.860
how goes the revolution?

30:27.192 --> 30:31.037
For 500 years the indigenous people
of Mexico have been crushed,

30:31.197 --> 30:32.617
treated like animals.

30:33.176 --> 30:35.093
We're starting to make our voices heard,

30:35.213 --> 30:37.922
10 million of us...
a million here in Chiapas alone.

30:38.401 --> 30:42.043
We fight for a roof over our heads,
for food on the table,

30:42.534 --> 30:44.593
for dignity and respect.

30:44.753 --> 30:48.134
But many, they do not like Indians.
They want us dead.

30:48.294 --> 30:50.218
You're not fucking around, are you?

30:51.406 --> 30:53.638
We're willing to die for our autonomy.

30:55.316 --> 30:57.142
Well, I would hate to see that.

30:58.631 --> 31:01.354
You're used to a certain kind of woman,
aren't you, Dr. Sandström?

31:01.614 --> 31:04.190
- I'm not that kind of woman.
- Meaning?

31:05.145 --> 31:06.813
I don't fuck for sport.

31:24.127 --> 31:27.551
So, other than some mild headaches,
you're certain Dr. Melnikov'll be fine?

31:27.711 --> 31:31.093
Physically, yes, but maybe confused
and anxious about his condition.

31:31.253 --> 31:34.262
- To be expected.
- Giving us a window of 2 or 3 months.

31:34.622 --> 31:36.667
- That's all the time I need.
- Good, then

31:36.827 --> 31:40.155
I think we can bring him
out of the coma in, say, 48 hours?

31:40.315 --> 31:42.694
Excellent. Keep my office
up-to-date on his progress.

31:42.854 --> 31:45.377
- And what about the girl?
- Tucked away.

31:45.563 --> 31:46.775
Not to worry.

31:47.813 --> 31:49.506
I'll say my goodbyes now.

32:00.582 --> 32:02.180
Thank you for everything.

32:03.420 --> 32:05.869
I'm sorry you won't be along
for the ride.

32:07.866 --> 32:09.325
Take care, my friend.

32:21.627 --> 32:23.278
We have a very serious problem.

32:29.824 --> 32:31.366
I don't understand.

32:32.288 --> 32:34.948
We made a mistake. We can't keep going.

32:35.533 --> 32:38.027
Bob, there's nothing wrong
with these animals.

32:41.247 --> 32:42.505
They're distressed.

32:44.167 --> 32:47.980
- We moved past animal trials weeks ago.
- We have to go back, Mr. Roth.

32:52.327 --> 32:53.933
Wait! Where are you going?

32:54.094 --> 32:56.909
I don't know. I have to double-check
the data, the stem cell cultures.

32:57.029 --> 32:59.764
Maybe we missed something
that affects another part of the brain.

33:00.213 --> 33:01.400
We need to...

33:02.401 --> 33:05.228
We can't go on
until we're sure that we...

33:05.438 --> 33:06.779
We've been over this.

33:07.910 --> 33:09.838
David will know what to do.

33:11.494 --> 33:12.675
You're shaking.

33:13.463 --> 33:14.463
Come on.

33:15.175 --> 33:16.289
Let's sit down.

33:17.572 --> 33:19.391
We'll talk this through.

33:19.551 --> 33:21.077
Help me understand.

33:30.497 --> 33:33.466
Hey. Where the hell is Rachel?
What is with her and her cell phone?

33:33.626 --> 33:35.564
- Maybe her battery's dead.
- Christ.

33:35.724 --> 33:38.251
- Any change in Bob?
- He's stable. No real change.

33:38.411 --> 33:39.762
How's Mexico?

33:40.252 --> 33:42.713
Hot. Buggy.
In the middle of a revolution.

33:43.243 --> 33:44.734
I need everybody on this.

33:45.126 --> 33:48.062
I'm sorry. You want us to drop Hudson?

33:48.330 --> 33:49.405
How bad is it?

33:49.615 --> 33:52.903
46 cases, 5 people actively suffering
from the disorder.

33:53.063 --> 33:56.152
It's a hit-and-run thing,
it lasts 3 or 4 days and then it's gone.

33:56.312 --> 33:59.172
- You got a take on it?
- Maybe. There's a Dr. Horner

33:59.332 --> 34:02.585
at Oxford who's doing interesting work
on calcitonin gene related peptide.

34:02.745 --> 34:04.103
No, I know Billy Horner.

34:04.223 --> 34:06.756
He's got a long ways to go
to understand the role of peptides.

34:06.876 --> 34:09.926
- Any other commonalities?
<i>- Well, it's a little farm town,</i>

34:10.085 --> 34:11.904
so everybody's drinking the same water,

34:12.024 --> 34:13.888
breathing the same air,
eating local food.

34:14.047 --> 34:16.042
What's your best guess, Mayko?

34:16.723 --> 34:18.521
Maybe a trigger of some kind.

34:18.681 --> 34:22.188
Corn is really huge down here right now,
everybody's eating it. I've got samples

34:22.348 --> 34:24.402
<i>of everything they put on their crops.</i>

34:24.563 --> 34:27.985
Park those samples with some techs.
We're getting our butts kicked.

34:28.145 --> 34:31.312
<i>Some kind of killer TB. I need
to get back up to NorBAC and...</i>

34:31.431 --> 34:33.491
- You're breaking up.
<i>- ... thousands at risk.</i>

34:33.650 --> 34:36.811
Get me on the next flight ASAP.
I'll try to get across the border today.

34:36.971 --> 34:37.812
Hello?

34:40.605 --> 34:43.242
Look, if you can hear me,
call me back. Bye.

34:47.559 --> 34:48.289
Shit.

34:50.726 --> 34:52.219
Kill me fucking now.

34:58.926 --> 35:00.059
What have we got?

35:00.220 --> 35:02.562
The first ones to be sick
were all Zapatista soldiers.

35:02.722 --> 35:04.439
There was no TB up here before.

35:04.724 --> 35:06.983
Maybe somebody from the outside
brought it in.

35:07.886 --> 35:10.393
It would not be so easy
for a stranger to go up this valley.

35:10.563 --> 35:13.155
- The government has patrols everywhere.
- What are you thinking?

35:14.380 --> 35:15.901
Okay. What about this?

35:16.021 --> 35:18.382
The Mexican government
has not invited anyone into Chiapas.

35:18.502 --> 35:21.121
- They're fully aware of this outbreak.
- It would not be the first time

35:21.292 --> 35:23.374
they'd ignore
the needs of the indigenous people.

35:23.494 --> 35:25.585
But what if this time,
they're ignoring the people

35:25.745 --> 35:27.993
because they want the TB to spread?

35:28.539 --> 35:31.841
- What if they brought it here?
- You think this could be an attack?

35:32.553 --> 35:35.193
I think if we find Patient Zero,
he might have a lot to tell us.

35:35.313 --> 35:36.901
You're suggesting the government

35:37.021 --> 35:39.098
is committing genocide
using germ warfare.

35:39.258 --> 35:41.128
Why is it so hard to believe?

35:41.248 --> 35:44.437
These are the most recent cases.
I need to speak to these men right away.

35:47.217 --> 35:48.780
Munoz, wait a minute.

35:50.253 --> 35:53.460
I'm going to go back to my lab tomorrow,
try to characterize this bacterium.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.826
Carlos will stay on,
see if he can locate Patient Zero,

35:55.946 --> 35:57.686
but let's get some concrete answers

35:57.806 --> 36:00.453
before we start throwing around words
like "biological weapons".

36:14.966 --> 36:16.089
It's time to go.

36:16.249 --> 36:18.091
Yes. Yes. All set. Ready.

36:18.251 --> 36:20.272
- Need some time?
- No. All...

36:20.432 --> 36:21.432
All set.

36:22.757 --> 36:24.904
Did we lose any more in the night?

36:25.064 --> 36:26.766
An old man and a child.

36:40.439 --> 36:41.827
I won't be long.

37:01.671 --> 37:02.515
See?

37:03.374 --> 37:04.374
All set.

37:04.872 --> 37:06.296
Lean toward me.

37:08.545 --> 37:11.340
- Is this really necessary?
- How else can I control you?

37:11.500 --> 37:14.462
You know, I've always wanted to have sex
with a bag on my head.

37:14.622 --> 37:17.506
Go right ahead. But keep it down.
I've got some driving to do.

37:43.664 --> 37:44.706
Hey, Bob.

37:50.866 --> 37:53.628
Sorry it's taken me so long
to come and visit you.

37:55.129 --> 37:57.439
Been pretty busy since they put you out.

37:59.231 --> 38:00.754
Actually thinking of...

38:01.054 --> 38:03.034
getting the same procedure
done to myself.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.873
I could use a good long sleep.

38:07.849 --> 38:10.558
True, a bottle of scotch
is more my style, but...

38:16.849 --> 38:18.841
Why didn't you call me, Bob?

38:22.004 --> 38:23.221
<i>We made a mistake!</i>

38:24.958 --> 38:26.015
Three months.

38:27.063 --> 38:28.601
Where the hell have you been?

38:30.096 --> 38:32.998
<i>David? We have to go back!
We made a mistake.</i>

38:33.118 --> 38:35.811
<i>We can't keep going.
You have to find Roth.</i>

38:37.913 --> 38:39.774
You just get better, okay?

38:54.425 --> 38:56.707
One of those techs you hired
screwed up the PCR

38:56.827 --> 38:59.946
- and ruined the samples from Mexico.
- What are you looking at me for?

39:00.066 --> 39:03.344
I came back to work with my team and
they're off dicking around in Illinois.

39:03.504 --> 39:06.535
That was a directive from Kirchner
and you told me to send them there.

39:06.655 --> 39:08.774
I redirected them.
They landed at Pearson an hour ago.

39:08.894 --> 39:11.727
Riddlemeyer cut me into a conversation
with the State Department.

39:11.847 --> 39:14.560
You have no idea how much
they do not want us in Chiapas.

39:16.139 --> 39:17.928
- Did you get the call yet?
- What call?

39:18.048 --> 39:20.992
Kirchner wasn't happy about seeing us
turning around and coming back home.

39:21.112 --> 39:22.880
- We got a lot of work.
- Is that...?

39:23.000 --> 39:26.080
Looks like Kirchner just got
to Riddlemeyer. Wes Field.

39:26.921 --> 39:28.925
- Yes, Sir, I understand.
- Wes.

39:29.814 --> 39:31.676
I understand your concern, but...

39:31.796 --> 39:35.355
this is a very virulent multi-drug
resistant strain of TB.

39:35.475 --> 39:37.618
Thousands of...
millions of people could die.

39:37.738 --> 39:41.027
And it's knocking on our back door.
We need to make this a priority.

39:41.147 --> 39:43.741
- We've got a load of samples to test.
- Park them with a tech.

39:43.861 --> 39:45.891
We've gotta ID this TB
and find a way to kill it.

39:46.011 --> 39:48.502
This thing in Illinois is ramping up.
We've got 7 new cases...

39:48.622 --> 39:50.891
I don't care. Pass it off to the CDC.

39:51.687 --> 39:54.749
There's nobody who can deal
with this thing in Chiapas but us.

39:54.869 --> 39:57.354
- This is what we're gonna do.
- It's 11 o'clock.

39:57.474 --> 39:59.525
- We haven't slept for...
- Sleep when you're dead.

39:59.685 --> 40:03.008
We're going to culture this thing
and find out what the hell it is...

40:03.128 --> 40:04.088
tonight!

41:07.447 --> 41:11.400
This strain of TB has the genetic makeup

41:11.520 --> 41:13.896
of a multi-drug resistant monster.

41:14.966 --> 41:15.918
All right.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.756
We know from the studies in Mexico

41:17.930 --> 41:20.896
that it's resistant
to all of the first line therapies

41:21.330 --> 41:23.442
and we know that it kills people fast.

41:23.602 --> 41:26.285
Could it be completely drug resistant?

41:26.405 --> 41:28.447
We don't know that for sure,
because remember,

41:28.607 --> 41:31.680
Flouroquinolone, Capreomycin, Kanamycin,

41:31.800 --> 41:34.935
Amikacin... those drugs
haven't been used down in Chiapas.

41:35.055 --> 41:38.620
Wait, hold on.
Part of the MDR protein structure

41:38.780 --> 41:41.260
is very similar
to a South African XDR strain

41:41.380 --> 41:43.129
that a team at Yale has been studying.

41:43.249 --> 41:44.713
And that South African

41:44.873 --> 41:47.800
has been bombarded with every drug
therapy known to man with no success.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.698
Except, how can this Chiapas strain
be resistant to drugs it's never seen?

41:52.059 --> 41:53.280
Carlos on two.

41:55.393 --> 41:56.632
How's it going?

41:56.752 --> 41:58.375
Six more dead this morning.

41:58.495 --> 42:00.667
Any progress
with the distribution scatter?

42:00.787 --> 42:03.107
Nothing concrete.
Right now I'm on vaccinations.

42:03.267 --> 42:06.525
When <i>Sub-Commandante</i> Munoz
realized the extent of the outbreak,

42:06.645 --> 42:08.821
<i>she scattered her men
in the countryside.</i>

42:08.981 --> 42:11.991
I'm trying to convince her
to gather them so that I can vaccinate

42:12.151 --> 42:14.052
<i>and hopefully delay
the onset of the disease.</i>

42:14.172 --> 42:15.779
Why does she need convincing?

42:15.899 --> 42:18.850
With the Mexican army in the area,
she feels they're safer where they are.

42:18.970 --> 42:21.033
That is just complete bullshit.

42:21.341 --> 42:23.252
Thank you for your opinion,
Dr. Sandström.

42:24.111 --> 42:25.880
Let Carlos do his work.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.840
It is my job to protect my soldiers.

42:28.009 --> 42:30.176
If they all get sick and die,
what good will it do you?

42:30.336 --> 42:32.049
Let him vaccinate your men.

42:32.743 --> 42:34.430
Any more clues about the strain?

42:34.590 --> 42:37.415
- We think it might be MDR TB.
- What does that mean?

42:37.535 --> 42:40.525
It means Multi Drug Resistant.
This is very hard to kill.

42:40.645 --> 42:42.938
Look, the vaccinations finally arrived.

42:43.098 --> 42:45.801
<i>I've trained a dozen teams of men
to help administer them.</i>

42:45.921 --> 42:49.578
- It's your best line of defence.
- And for those who are already sick?

42:49.698 --> 42:51.850
We're culturing
for other treatment cocktails

42:51.970 --> 42:53.991
to find the parameters
of the drug resistance.

42:54.151 --> 42:56.733
You're saying
there are no drugs that will fight this?

42:56.853 --> 42:58.829
Nothing in our current medicine chest.

42:59.084 --> 43:02.617
- This is bullshit.
- So is not getting your men vaccinated.

43:03.471 --> 43:05.349
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

43:06.812 --> 43:09.101
- Carlos, you know what to do.
- I do.

43:55.461 --> 43:56.820
Where you going?

44:10.030 --> 44:10.734
Okay.

44:12.896 --> 44:15.496
Look, I have money.
Maybe we can buy them off.

44:19.263 --> 44:20.341
Oh, shit.

44:23.323 --> 44:26.000
- Come on, we have to move.
- If they catch us they will kill us.

44:26.966 --> 44:28.469
- We have to go!
- You go.

44:29.989 --> 44:31.184
What will you do?

44:31.606 --> 44:32.715
Distract them.

44:33.492 --> 44:35.344
- I'm good at distracting.
- No!

45:07.576 --> 45:09.664
I'm not comfortable
with the shortcuts we're taking.

45:09.784 --> 45:11.929
We're rushing the process
and we're gonna come up

45:12.049 --> 45:14.618
- with results that are inconclusive.
- 20 people died last night.

45:14.738 --> 45:16.300
We'll live with "inconclusive".

45:18.105 --> 45:19.261
I got bad news.

45:19.589 --> 45:21.430
The sequence analysis is complete.

45:21.590 --> 45:25.278
Our TB strain is identical to
the Kwazulu-Natal slum in South Africa.

45:25.485 --> 45:27.608
So it's not just multi-drug resistant.

45:27.728 --> 45:30.522
It's one level up.
We don't have a clue what can kill it.

45:30.682 --> 45:34.109
What the fuck is a South African
TB strain doing in Chiapas?

45:34.661 --> 45:36.278
David, Riddlemeyer's on line 3.

45:36.438 --> 45:39.073
- We'll get to Illinois when we can.
- It's not about Illinois.

45:43.939 --> 45:46.497
Hello, Carl. Isn't it past your bedtime?

45:48.225 --> 45:50.178
I just got a call from Homeland.

45:51.257 --> 45:52.919
There was a firefight in Chiapas.

45:53.080 --> 45:55.339
<i>It appears
that Carlos was caught in the middle.</i>

45:56.270 --> 45:57.395
He's missing.

45:58.109 --> 45:59.844
And, we are to presume, dead.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.437
- You hear from David?
- No, you?

46:10.597 --> 46:12.071
He went back to Mexico?

46:12.191 --> 46:14.149
- Of course he did.
- Damn it!

46:14.309 --> 46:16.539
- I'm still using those!
- <i>Es un hijo de puta!</i>

46:16.659 --> 46:18.862
You don't want me here, I'll leave.
Just give me Carlos.

46:19.022 --> 46:21.198
- Tell him what you told me.
- The <i>Federales</i> attacked us.

46:21.358 --> 46:24.284
I ran one way, Carlos ran the other.
Then I heard shots.

46:24.444 --> 46:26.550
He's been missing for 2 days
and you have nothing!

46:26.670 --> 46:30.375
- I just came to see how he was doing.
- He'll be back sooner than you think.

46:30.742 --> 46:33.413
- But he is improving?
- You sound beat, David.

46:33.533 --> 46:36.338
It's improving.
Five minutes ago I thought I was dead.

46:36.498 --> 46:38.828
Nine-year-old who heated
hot chocolate in the microwave...

46:38.948 --> 46:42.302
scalded his mouth, tongue, lips, not
to mention his oesophagus and stomach.

46:42.462 --> 46:45.806
All we know is that it produces
a compound that blocks pain receptors.

46:45.966 --> 46:48.132
<i>The plant-like fungus
that I found in all the victims?</i>

46:48.252 --> 46:49.853
It's not just growing in the victims.

46:49.973 --> 46:52.387
It's growing
in the noses of everybody in Hudson.

46:52.507 --> 46:53.939
Great. What are they snorting?

46:54.099 --> 46:56.661
- David, how safe are you?
- I don't know, Mayko.
