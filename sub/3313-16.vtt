WEBVTT

00:07.638 --> 00:10.380
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.381 --> 00:12.782
SIS, TELL YOUR DRIVER NOT
TO GO DOWN THIRD STREET

00:12.783 --> 00:15.045
BECAUSE THE SNOW PLOWS
NEVER GO THAT WAY.

00:15.046 --> 00:16.446
YES, I AM A CITY COUNCILPERSON,

00:16.447 --> 00:18.448
BUT I HAVE NO PULL
WITH BIG PLOW.

00:18.449 --> 00:19.789
OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU IN A MINUTE.

00:19.790 --> 00:21.721
IT'S PRETTY SLICK GETTING
JOE OFF TO THE AIRPORT

00:21.722 --> 00:23.423
AN HOUR BEFORE OUR MOM SHOWS UP.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.655
BY NOW, JOE IS ON A PLANE
ON HIS WAY TO JERSEY

00:25.656 --> 00:28.358
WITH NO IDEA THAT THE WOMAN
WHO HELPED DESTROY HIS CAREER

00:28.359 --> 00:29.699
IS ON HER WAY HERE.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.501
I HATE LYING TO A FRIEND.

00:31.502 --> 00:33.763
BUT I AM SO GOOD AT IT.

00:33.764 --> 00:36.236
AH AH AH! NO HANGING ORNAMENTS

00:36.237 --> 00:38.037
UNTIL MEREDITH GETS HERE.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.339
CHECK THE LIST.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.810
WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING
ON YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST

00:40.811 --> 00:42.272
IN EXACT ORDER?

00:42.273 --> 00:45.175
YES, BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE ALL
THE CHRISTMAS FUN GO SMOOTHER.

00:45.176 --> 00:47.777
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM ONLY GETS
TWO DAYS AWAY FROM PRISON.

00:47.778 --> 00:48.749
I WANT HER TO RELAX.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.452
YEAH, 'CAUSE NOTHING WILL
TAKE HER MIND OFF PRISON

00:52.453 --> 00:55.425
LIKE STRICTLY SCHEDULED
MEALS AND RECREATION TIMES.

00:55.426 --> 00:58.188
WAIT, YOU PUT "MEREDITH"
ON HER STOCKING?

00:58.189 --> 00:59.289
DID I SPELL IT RIGHT?

00:59.290 --> 01:01.191
IT SHOULD BE SPELLED "MOM."

01:01.192 --> 01:03.663
AS IN MOM.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.664
HEY, HER CAB'S HERE.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.296
BACK UP BACK UP BACK UP BACK UP.

01:06.297 --> 01:08.268
OKAY. WE CAN ALL YELL
OUT WHEN SHE COMES IN.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.799
All: MERRY CHRI...

01:09.800 --> 01:12.672
JOE, WHAT THE HELL?!

01:12.673 --> 01:15.576
YEAH, "MERRY CHRI..."
BACK AT YOU.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.808
AIRPORT'S SNOWED IN. ALL
THE FLIGHTS ARE GROUNDED.

01:18.809 --> 01:20.650
WELL, THAT JUST
SPOILS EVERYTHING.

01:20.651 --> 01:22.112
FOR YOU, NOT FOR US.

01:22.113 --> 01:23.313
WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE.

01:23.314 --> 01:24.714
UNLESS YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE HERE.

01:24.715 --> 01:26.316
JUST KIDDING. MERRY CHRISTMAS.

01:26.317 --> 01:27.658
BUT REALLY, YOU CAN GO.

- BECAUSE AS MUCH AS WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU HERE,

01:54.185 --> 01:57.547
I JUST HAVE A FEELING THOSE AIRPORTS
ARE GONNA OPEN ANY MINUTE NOW.

01:57.548 --> 01:59.389
BURKE, THE ONLY THING FLYING
OUT OF HERE TONIGHT'S

01:59.390 --> 02:01.651
- GONNA BE REINDEER. TRUST ME.
- ( brakes squeak )

02:01.652 --> 02:03.793
HEY, A CAB JUST PULLED UP. ARE
YOU GUYS EXPECTING SOMEONE?

02:03.794 --> 02:05.725
- SANTA.
- PIZZA.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.727
SANTA WITH PIZZA. SANTA PIZZA.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.129
THEY MAKE THE CRUST OUT OF FRUITCAKE.
IT'S TERRIBLE.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.732
WHY DON'T YOU JUST WAIT UPSTAIRS
IN YOUR ROOM FOR TWO DAYS.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.803
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

02:13.804 --> 02:15.435
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?

02:15.436 --> 02:17.537
AUNT MEL, JUST GIVE IT UP.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.808
ALL RIGHT? IT'S OVER.

02:18.809 --> 02:21.271
UH, JOE? HERE.

02:21.272 --> 02:22.672
YOU GUYS MADE ME A STOCKING?

02:22.673 --> 02:24.674
AWW.

02:24.675 --> 02:26.677
THAT SAYS "MEREDITH"?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.719
WAIT A MINUTE, THE MEREDITH?

02:29.720 --> 02:31.521
JAILBIRD MEREDITH?

02:31.522 --> 02:34.284
HALF THE TEAM THAT
RUINED MY LIFE MEREDITH?

02:34.285 --> 02:37.187
I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH
GLITTER FOR ALL THAT.

02:37.188 --> 02:38.628
HOW DID SHE GET OUT OF PRISON?

02:38.629 --> 02:40.330
IT'S JUST A TWO DAY
CHRISTMAS FURLOUGH.

02:40.331 --> 02:41.561
I MENTIONED THAT, DIDN'T I?

02:41.562 --> 02:43.663
NO, I WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED THAT.
KIND OF THE WAY

02:43.664 --> 02:46.336
YOU REMEMBER A REPEATED
STABBING IN YOUR BACK.

02:46.337 --> 02:47.797
HOW COULD YOU KEEP THIS FROM ME?

02:47.798 --> 02:51.471
OH, IT WASN'T EASY, BUT I THINK
I DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.942
I WAS JUST TRYING TO
PROTECT YOUR FEELINGS.

02:52.943 --> 02:54.904
UH, SHE'S PAYING THE DRIVER.

02:54.905 --> 02:57.307
IS SHE? PROBABLY WITH
SOME OF MY MONEY.

02:57.308 --> 02:58.678
OKAY, LOOK. YOU'VE GOT
TO CONTROL YOURSELF.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.350
THIS VISIT IS VERY
IMPORTANT TO MY SISTER.

03:00.351 --> 03:02.212
I KNOW. AND SHE HAS SUCH A
DIFFICULT LIFE, YOU KNOW?

03:02.213 --> 03:04.414
GETTING THOSE WONDERFUL VISITS
FROM HER CHILDREN ONCE A MONTH

03:04.415 --> 03:05.685
AT THE COUNTRY CLUB WHERE THEY

03:05.686 --> 03:07.687
FORCE HER TO DO PILATES
AND WATCH PREMIUM CABLE.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.589
YOU KNOW, THERE IS A WAITING
LIST TO GET INTO THAT PRISON.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.890
GOOD, JOE. GOOD.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.762
JUST GET IT ALL OUT NOW BEFORE
SHE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.

03:12.763 --> 03:15.325
- ( knocking on door )
- OKAY, YOU'RE DONE.

03:15.326 --> 03:16.797
GET IN THE CHRISTMAS
SPIRIT OR I'LL CUT YOU.

03:19.470 --> 03:20.670
HELLO, KIDS!

03:20.671 --> 03:22.332
- HEY, MOM!
- MOM!

03:22.333 --> 03:24.203
COME HERE. OHH!

03:24.204 --> 03:25.635
GET IN HERE SMELLY MELLY.

03:25.636 --> 03:27.477
OKAY. AND DON'T CALL ME THAT.

03:27.478 --> 03:28.608
( chuckles )

03:28.609 --> 03:30.641
OH, THIS IS GONNA BE THE
BEST CHRISTMAS EVER.

03:31.982 --> 03:34.344
WHAT THE HELL IS
LONGO DOING HERE?

03:34.345 --> 03:35.885
SURPRISE.

03:35.886 --> 03:37.747
YOU SAID HE WAS GONNA
BE IN NEW JERSEY

03:37.748 --> 03:39.719
WITH THE REST OF THE HOUSEWIVES.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.691
NOW THAT YOU'RE
OUT OF THE JOINT,

03:41.692 --> 03:43.293
DOES THAT MEAN A SAD BANK ROBBER

03:43.294 --> 03:44.994
WON'T BE GETTING HIS
SECRET SANTA THIS YEAR?

03:44.995 --> 03:46.756
OKAY, YOU TWO.

03:46.757 --> 03:47.957
HEY, WHEN LIFE GIVES
YOU LEMONS...

03:47.958 --> 03:49.559
YEAH, WELL SPEAKING
AS THE LEMON,

03:49.560 --> 03:50.830
WHO'S BEEN SQUEEZED DRY,

03:50.831 --> 03:52.702
I'LL BE UPSTAIRS IN MY ROOM.

03:52.703 --> 03:53.834
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

03:55.005 --> 03:56.367
OH, THAT'S A NICE
ANKLET BY THE WAY.

03:58.469 --> 04:00.271
WHAT IS THAT, A 24-KARAT G.P.S.?

04:02.012 --> 04:03.814
( knocks on door )

04:05.245 --> 04:08.548
LOOK, JOE, I KNOW IT'S
TOUGH SEEING MEREDITH.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.280
IT BRINGS UP A LOT
OF BAD MEMORIES...

04:10.281 --> 04:13.283
( grunting )

04:13.284 --> 04:15.385
THAT'S GOOD, JOE.
GRUNT IT ALL OUT.

04:15.386 --> 04:17.557
BUT JUST SO YOU'RE AWARE,
IT IS CHRISTMAS EVE,

04:17.558 --> 04:20.290
AND KNOWING THAT THE GRINCH IS
UP HERE DOING HIS ANGRY CURLS

04:20.291 --> 04:21.891
IS KIND OF KILLING THE
MOOD DOWN IN WHOVILLE.

04:21.892 --> 04:23.694
HA HA. THAT'S SO
FUNNY, I'M STILL POOR.

04:25.296 --> 04:27.567
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
ONE WITH MEREDITH ISSUES.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.838
ALL OF OUR LIVES SHE ALWAYS
GOT WHAT SHE WANTED,

04:28.839 --> 04:30.500
AND SHE ALWAYS GOT IT FIRST.

04:30.501 --> 04:31.971
THE BOOBS, THE RACHEL HAIRCUT,

04:31.972 --> 04:33.272
AND THEN THE HUSBAND.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.744
SHE ALWAYS RUBBED MY NOSE IN IT.

04:34.745 --> 04:36.906
WELL, NOT THE BOOBS,
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE.

04:36.907 --> 04:39.008
YEAH, BUT YOUR SISTER IS NOT
ONE-UPPING YOU ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

04:39.009 --> 04:40.610
MY LIFE IS RUINED RIGHT NOW.

04:40.611 --> 04:41.751
SO IS HERS.

04:41.752 --> 04:42.752
SHE'S DIVORCED,

04:42.753 --> 04:44.013
SHE HARDLY GETS TO SEE HER KIDS

04:44.014 --> 04:45.815
AND SHE ALMOST NEVER
GETS TO GO SHOPPING.

04:45.816 --> 04:46.956
I MEAN, DOESN'T ANY OF HER PAIN

04:46.957 --> 04:49.059
MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE
MORE CHRISTMASY?

04:50.561 --> 04:52.021
A LITTLE.

04:52.022 --> 04:53.863
IT WOULD HELP ME IF SHE WAS
MISSING A COUPLE OF TEETH.

04:53.864 --> 04:56.796
( scoffs ) OKAY, SO YOU'LL
COME DOWNSTAIRS AND JOIN US

04:56.797 --> 04:58.668
AND PUT YOUR RESENTMENT
AWAY FOR TWO DAYS?

04:58.669 --> 05:00.800
OH NO, I COULDN'T COME DOWNSTAIRS
NOW EVEN IF I WANTED TO.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.603
- WHAT?
- I GOTTA DO MY LEFT SIDE.

05:03.604 --> 05:04.875
I DON'T WANT TO GET ALL UNEVEN.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.779
HEY, REMEMBER WHEN WE
WERE LITTLE, MELLY,

05:09.780 --> 05:11.741
YOU USED TO LOVE TO
WATCH ME MAKE THESE?

05:11.742 --> 05:12.882
I DO.

05:12.883 --> 05:15.385
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY MADE
THIS GINGERBREAD MYSELF.

05:15.386 --> 05:17.647
'CAUSE I CAN USE THE OVEN NOW.

05:17.648 --> 05:18.948
IT'S NOT BAD FOR A FIRST TRY.

05:18.949 --> 05:20.690
IT JUST TAKES PRACTICE...

05:20.691 --> 05:22.552
OR SKILL.

05:22.553 --> 05:25.625
RIGHT. BUT IT'S NOT
A COMPETITION.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.626
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T I JUST GET

05:26.627 --> 05:27.697
YOU GUYS SOME MORE GINGERBREAD

05:27.698 --> 05:29.929
WITH THIS RANDOM OVEN MITT.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.562
OH, WHAT DOES THAT SAY?
COUNCILWOMAN MEL BURKE.

05:32.563 --> 05:33.803
( silly voice ) THAT'S ME.

05:33.804 --> 05:36.335
OKAY, WHO NEEDS ANOTHER
GINGERBREAD WALL?

05:36.336 --> 05:37.407
WE'RE GOOD.

05:37.408 --> 05:38.708
OKAY.

05:38.709 --> 05:42.572
LET'S SEE, MAYBE I
CAN PIPE THE DOORS?

05:42.573 --> 05:43.573
ALREADY ICED.

05:43.574 --> 05:44.644
OKAY.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.815
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO AT ALL?

05:45.816 --> 05:47.577
OH YES.

05:47.578 --> 05:48.878
WE NEED YOU OVER HERE
FOR A FAMILY PHOTO...

05:48.879 --> 05:49.879
OH GREAT.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.851
...OF ME AND MY
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.853
OH. SURE.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.725
A PICTURE WITH ME NOT IN IT.

05:55.726 --> 05:57.987
- SAY "JOLLY."
- ( camera clicks )

05:57.988 --> 05:59.689
ALL RIGHT. HERE I AM...

05:59.690 --> 06:01.691
DOWNSTAIRS AS REQUESTED.

06:01.692 --> 06:03.362
WE'RE MAKING GINGERBREAD HOUSES.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.394
YEAH, MY MOM'S THE MASTER.

06:04.395 --> 06:06.035
OH, IT'S SO TRUE.

06:06.036 --> 06:08.367
YEAH. SHE'LL SHOW YOU
HOW IT'S DONE, JOE.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.769
I MEAN CHECK OUT
THIS ONE SHE MADE.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.401
YEAH. ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL, LONGO?

06:11.402 --> 06:13.443
YEAH, IT IS. MAYBE THERE'S
A ROOM ABOVE THE GARAGE

06:13.444 --> 06:15.044
THAT I COULD AFFORD.
( chuckles )

06:15.045 --> 06:17.908
'CAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF
GINGER, BUT NO BREAD.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.050
REMEMBER, WE'RE DROPPING
THESE HOUSES OFF

06:21.051 --> 06:22.412
AT THE CHILDREN'S
HOSPITAL LATER,

06:22.413 --> 06:23.753
SO LET'S TRY TO
FILL THEM WITH LOVE

06:23.754 --> 06:26.015
AND NOT BITTERNESS, BECAUSE
BITTERNESS ISN'T YUMMY.

06:26.016 --> 06:28.589
AND MY KID SISTER IS AN
EXPERT ON BITTERNESS.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.720
WHAT?

06:30.721 --> 06:32.062
I SAID YOU WERE AN EXPERT.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.724
WHILE I LET YOU TWO
HASH THAT OUT,

06:34.725 --> 06:35.725
I THINK I'LL BUILD A
HOUSE OVER HERE IN THIS

06:35.726 --> 06:36.866
SKETCHY NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:36.867 --> 06:38.027
WHERE ALL THE GINGERBREAD
MEN HAD TO GO

06:38.028 --> 06:39.769
WHO HAD TO START OVER.

06:39.770 --> 06:41.701
WAIT, JOE, THAT'S
NOT HOW IT'S DONE.

06:41.702 --> 06:42.772
YOU CAN'T USE THOSE WALLS.

06:42.773 --> 06:44.574
OH, I THINK I CAN. ( chuckles )

06:44.575 --> 06:46.035
FINE. BUT THEY'RE WAY TOO HOT.

06:46.036 --> 06:47.707
THEY'RE JUST GONNA
MELT THE ICING.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.439
IF I WERE YOU, I'D
JUST BE PATIENT

06:49.440 --> 06:50.710
AND WAIT TILL THEY COOL DOWN.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.713
I DON'T KNOW IF THESE WALLS
ARE EVER GONNA COOL DOWN.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.414
OH, THEY WILL IF THEY WANT TO.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.847
THIS WALL HAS HAD A LOT
TAKEN AWAY FROM IT...

06:57.848 --> 07:00.049
ITS MONEY, ITS HOUSE,

07:00.050 --> 07:02.051
ITS PORSCHE.

07:02.052 --> 07:04.724
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE ONLY
THING THIS WALL HAS LEFT IS...

07:04.725 --> 07:07.126
ITS AMAZING GOOD LOOKS.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.899
MAN, EVEN I GET THIS.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.531
OKAY, HERE'S A THOUGHT.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.863
HOW ABOUT WE SKIP TO THE NEXT
FUN ACTIVITY ON THE LIST.

07:13.864 --> 07:15.204
LET'S SEE... OOH.

07:15.205 --> 07:17.737
"DECORATING THE TREE."

07:17.738 --> 07:19.438
( silly voice ) GREAT IDEA.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.711
HOW DOES SHE DO IT?

07:25.616 --> 07:26.716
YOU KNOW, JOE, CAN WE JUST...

07:26.717 --> 07:27.718
CAN WE CLEAR THE AIR?

07:29.149 --> 07:30.880
YOU SOMEHOW THINK
THAT I AM RESPONSIBLE

07:30.881 --> 07:31.981
FOR RUINING YOUR LIFE.

07:31.982 --> 07:33.723
YOU KNOW, THIS GINGERBREAD
WAS ABOUT TO COOL DOWN,

07:33.724 --> 07:35.525
AND YOU HAD TO GO CRANKING
UP THE OVEN AGAIN.

07:35.526 --> 07:37.056
YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE COMPANY?

07:37.057 --> 07:38.728
NOBODY WAS TOTALLY INNOCENT.

07:38.729 --> 07:41.060
THERE WERE THOSE THAT
WERE ACTIVELY INVOLVED

07:41.061 --> 07:42.161
AND THOSE THAT LOOKED
THE OTHER WAY.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.794
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I'M TO BLAME?

07:44.795 --> 07:47.196
I'M SAYING THAT WE
ALL PLAYED A PART.

07:47.197 --> 07:49.068
REALLY? 'CAUSE I DON'T
REMEMBER AUDITIONING

07:49.069 --> 07:50.870
FOR THE PART OF THE
WORLD'S BIGGEST SUCKER.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.102
WELL, YOU NAILED IT.

07:53.644 --> 07:55.074
LOOK, WORD OF ADVICE?

07:55.075 --> 07:57.747
ALL THIS ANGER THAT
YOU'RE FILLED WITH,

07:57.748 --> 07:58.979
LET IT GO.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.981
MAYBE YOU COULD JUST
STEAL IT FROM ME.

08:01.982 --> 08:02.982
( chuckles )

08:02.983 --> 08:04.854
I'M KIDDING. I'M KIDDING.

08:04.855 --> 08:06.716
I'M FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:06.717 --> 08:08.988
I AM FILLED WITH NOTHING
BUT CHRISTMAS SPIRIT,

08:08.989 --> 08:10.860
HO.

08:10.861 --> 08:11.892
HO HO.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.226
REALLY. I'M FINE.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.598
TOTALLY FINE.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.030
( chuckles )

08:21.031 --> 08:23.002
YOU KNOW, SHE ACTUALLY
DOES DO A REALLY NICE JOB

08:23.003 --> 08:24.874
ON THESE THINGS. WOW.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.006
( chuckles )

08:29.209 --> 08:30.810
( grunts )

08:30.811 --> 08:32.142
IF ONLY SHE WAS INSIDE.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.089
AREN'T RYDER AND LENNOX AMAZING?

08:40.090 --> 08:41.751
I MEAN, THEY ARE
TURNING OUT SO GREAT.

08:41.752 --> 08:42.892
YEAH.

08:42.893 --> 08:44.123
THEY REALLY ARE.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.756
AND I THINK I KNOW WHY.

08:46.757 --> 08:48.027
YOU CAN SAY IT.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.128
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T
JUST HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.961
NO, IT DOESN'T.

08:51.962 --> 08:54.034
IT'S THE PHONE CALLS
WITH ME EVERY MONTH.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.567
I CAN GIVE SO MUCH
QUALITY MOTHERING

08:57.568 --> 08:59.269
IN THOSE 10 SUPERVISED MINUTES.

09:00.841 --> 09:01.911
THAT MUST BE IT.

09:01.912 --> 09:03.643
YEAH, THEY ARE LUCKY TO HAVE

09:03.644 --> 09:04.844
SUCH AN INVOLVED PARENT.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.676
YEAH, I WOULD DO
ANYTHING FOR THOSE KIDS.

09:06.677 --> 09:08.547
MOM, CAN YOU HOLD THE
OTHER END OF THIS?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.579
- ( phone buzzing )
- OH, NO. SORRY.

09:09.580 --> 09:11.221
GOT A PHONE CALL.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.785
WE KNOW THIS IS A
LITTLE AWKWARD FOR YOU,

09:15.786 --> 09:17.727
BUT WE'RE GLAD YOU
DECIDED TO JOIN US.

09:17.728 --> 09:18.988
LOOK, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.

09:18.989 --> 09:20.590
I GUESS IT IS KIND OF COOL

09:20.591 --> 09:22.762

SURPRISE YOU FOR CHRISTMAS.

09:22.763 --> 09:23.833
YEAH.

09:23.834 --> 09:27.066
IT WAS SO TOTALLY
OUT OF THE BLUE.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.968
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE KNEW FOR WEEKS.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.640
AAH!

09:30.641 --> 09:32.142
THAT CHRISTMAS WAS COMING.

09:34.104 --> 09:35.645
WAIT A MINUTE.

09:35.646 --> 09:37.306

DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

09:37.307 --> 09:39.649

SPECIAL TIME OF YEAR

10:26.326 --> 10:27.857
AND I HAVE BEEN RAISING
HER KIDS FOR THREE YEARS

10:27.858 --> 10:29.199
WITH NO HELP FROM ANYBODY.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.132
( stammers )

10:33.133 --> 10:34.764
ANYBODY?

10:34.765 --> 10:35.805

10:42.773 --> 10:44.674
WAIT, I'LL GET IT.

10:44.675 --> 10:46.375
IT'S MY LITTLE SURPRISE
FOR THE FAMILY.

10:46.376 --> 10:48.247
SEE? MEREDITH'S TRYING.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.318
SHE GOT US ALL A GIFT.

10:49.319 --> 10:51.220
MAYBE IT'S A BOX OF STEAKS.

10:51.221 --> 10:52.782
MEL, JOE,

10:52.783 --> 10:54.223
THIS IS ELIOT McDUNNOUGH.

10:54.224 --> 10:55.224
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

10:55.225 --> 10:56.926
YOU LOOK VERY FAMILIAR.

10:56.927 --> 10:59.288
OH, I WAS THE JUDGE AT MEREDITH'S
SECURITIES FRAUD TRIAL.

10:59.289 --> 11:00.289
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:00.290 --> 11:03.162
ELIOT IS MY BOYFRIEND.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.134
WHAT?!

11:05.135 --> 11:07.136
SHE SAID THAT ELIOT
IS HER BOYFRIEND.

11:07.137 --> 11:08.138
I HEARD.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.901
DATING YOUR JUDGE. THAT IS SO...

11:11.902 --> 11:15.074
SOMETHING SISTERS USUALLY SHARE.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.675
WELL, YEAH.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.278
WE STARTED DATING RIGHT AFTER
LEWIS AND I GOT DIVORCED.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.280
BEFORE THAT, IT WAS
TOTALLY PLATONIC

11:21.281 --> 11:23.312
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SKYPE SEX.

11:23.313 --> 11:24.754
GOOD TO KNOW.

11:24.755 --> 11:27.957
SO BANGING MORE THAN
GAVELS, ARE WE?

11:27.958 --> 11:29.789
WELL, THE JURY MAY
HAVE CONVICTED HER,

11:29.790 --> 11:31.791
BUT AS THE PRESIDING JUDGE,

11:31.792 --> 11:34.124
I BELIEVE THE ONLY THING
MEREDITH STOLE WAS MY HEART.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.128
HOW'S THAT SERENITY COMING?

11:39.129 --> 11:41.230
IT JUST CAME BACK UP.

11:41.231 --> 11:43.773
- FOUND 'EM.
- OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

11:43.774 --> 11:46.806
MEREDITH, AREN'T YOU GONNA INTRODUCE
YOUR BOYFRIEND TO YOUR KIDS?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.277
- HEY, ELIOT.
- MERRY CHRISTMAS.

11:48.278 --> 11:49.278
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

11:49.279 --> 11:50.280
Both: SUP, DOG?

11:52.282 --> 11:53.913
THEY APPEAR TO BE ACQUAINTED.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.786
SO YOU GUYS KNEW ABOUT
YOUR MOM'S BOYFRIEND

11:56.787 --> 11:58.217
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.319
WELL, SHE SAID SHE WANTED
TO TELL YOU HERSELF.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.121
SHE SAID YOU LIKE SURPRISES.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.824
OH. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
THAT ISN'T A SURPRISE...

12:04.825 --> 12:06.255
THE FACT THAT AFTER
ALL THESE YEARS,

12:06.256 --> 12:08.998
- MY SISTER'S STILL...
- ♪ SNOWMAN IN THE YARD ♪

12:08.999 --> 12:11.000
- ♪ SANTA FLIES ABOVE.. ♪
- SHUT UP!

12:11.001 --> 12:12.061
IT'S NOT A REAL SONG.

12:12.062 --> 12:15.065
UH, EXCUSE ME. I AM LATE
FOR MY EGGNOG COMA.

12:19.009 --> 12:20.069
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:20.070 --> 12:21.140
OH, NEVER BETTER.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.471
YOU KNOW, MY SISTER'S
IN PRISON AND YET

12:22.472 --> 12:25.244
SHE STILL FOUND A HANDSOME
GUY WITH A GREAT JOB

12:25.245 --> 12:26.976
AND I'M NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO HAVING A BOY...

12:26.977 --> 12:29.979
HEY. I HOPE IT'S OKAY
THAT ELIOT DROPPED BY.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.350
HE JUST WANTED TO MEET YOU.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.082
AND I REALLY WANTED
YOU TO MEET HIM TOO.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.384
OH, IT'S GREAT. IT'S ALL GREAT.
( chuckles )

12:35.385 --> 12:38.227
OKAY, WELL... BECAUSE IF
THERE'S SOMEONE IN YOUR LIFE

12:38.228 --> 12:39.889
I'D LIKE TO MEET HIM TOO.

12:39.890 --> 12:41.530
IS THERE A MAN IN YOUR LIFE?

12:41.531 --> 12:43.232
NO. NO.

12:43.233 --> 12:45.034
YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN MEETING
THE RIGHT KIND OF GUYS.

12:45.035 --> 12:47.196
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
IF I GOT INDICTED.

12:47.197 --> 12:49.038
( both laugh )

12:49.039 --> 12:50.199
OHH.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.271
I'M SO GLAD YOU CAN
STILL JOKE YOUR WAY

12:52.272 --> 12:53.502
OUT OF YOUR REAL FEELINGS, MEL.

12:53.503 --> 12:56.146
( chuckles )

12:57.177 --> 12:59.508
DO YOU SEE WHAT SHE DOES?!

12:59.509 --> 13:01.210
DON'T LET HER PUSH YOUR BUTTONS.

13:01.211 --> 13:02.281
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.512
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
GONNA RISE ABOVE.

13:03.513 --> 13:05.154
WAY ABOVE.

13:05.155 --> 13:07.486
WATCH ME RISE ALL THE
WAY TO THE NORTH POLE.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.018
ON DASHER, ON DANCER

13:09.019 --> 13:11.191
AND ALL... THE OTHER GUYS.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.495
( stilted ) WHAT
HAPPENED TO AUNT MEL?

13:16.496 --> 13:18.267
WHERE OH WHERE COULD
SHE HAVE GONE

13:18.268 --> 13:20.029
WHEN CHRISTMAS IS NIGH?

13:20.030 --> 13:23.032
HARK, DO I HEAR SLEIGH
BELLS ON THE ROOF?

13:23.033 --> 13:24.174
WHO COULD THAT BE?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.306
HO HO HO!

13:27.307 --> 13:29.378
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY!

13:29.379 --> 13:31.340
Both: MERRY CHRISTMAS.

13:31.341 --> 13:34.343
OH, WELL, LOOKS LIKE
MOST EVERYBODY'S HERE.

13:34.344 --> 13:37.016
BUT WHERE'S THAT
ADORABLE MEL BURKE?

13:37.017 --> 13:39.889
SHE ALWAYS DISAPPEARS
WHEN SANTA SHOWS UP.

13:39.890 --> 13:42.291
HO HO HO.

13:42.292 --> 13:43.322
SHE DOES THIS EVERY YEAR?

13:43.323 --> 13:44.493
EVERY YEAR, MAN.

13:44.494 --> 13:46.495
ALL RIGHT. THIS YEAR,
SANTA'S GONNA NEED

13:46.496 --> 13:49.328
- HIS LITTLE ELF HELPER.
- HEY, WHAT THE...?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.100
BUP BUP BUP. YOUR
POINTY-EARED ASS

13:51.101 --> 13:52.201
IS SANTA'S PROPERTY NOW.

13:52.202 --> 13:54.003
SANTA BETTER WATCH HIS MOUTH

13:54.004 --> 13:55.464
OR ELSE SANTA'S GONNA BE GETTING
SHOVED BACK UP THE CHIMNEY.

13:55.465 --> 13:56.906
HO HO HO!

13:56.907 --> 13:58.267
WHAT A GRUMPY LITTLE ELF.

13:58.268 --> 14:00.039
- YOU...
- ALL RIGHT.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.041
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR SOME GIFTS.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.513
SO, HAVE YOU KIDS
BEEN GOOD THIS YEAR?

14:04.514 --> 14:07.616
HAVE YOU BEEN ESPECIALLY
NICE TO YOUR SWEET AUNT MEL?

14:07.617 --> 14:09.048
WE HAVE, SANTA.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.449
WE DO EVERYTHING SHE TELLS US.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.152
EVEN PRETENDING IT'S NOT
LAME WHEN SHE DRESSES UP.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.483
HO HO HO!

14:14.484 --> 14:16.485
SANTA LIKES YOU GUYS.

14:16.486 --> 14:17.626
OKAY.

14:17.627 --> 14:19.158
ONE GIFT TONIGHT, AND
THE REST WILL BE

14:19.159 --> 14:20.289
UNDER THE TREE TOMORROW.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.231
BUT, MEREDITH,

14:22.232 --> 14:23.893
I CHECKED MY NICE LIST TWICE,

14:23.894 --> 14:25.434
AND I DIDN'T SEE YOUR NAME.

14:25.435 --> 14:29.038
HMM. CHECK THE NAUGHTY LIST.

14:29.039 --> 14:31.170
OKAY. YOU'RE GROSSING SANTA OUT,

14:31.171 --> 14:34.103
BUT SANTA GOT YOU A GIFT ANYWAY,

14:34.104 --> 14:36.245
BECAUSE SANTA IS SO FORGIVING.

14:36.246 --> 14:37.506
WAIT A MINUTE, SANTA.

14:37.507 --> 14:39.378
THIS MUST HAVE FALLEN
OUT OF YOUR BAG.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.051
IT'S GOT MEREDITH'S NAME ON IT.

14:42.252 --> 14:44.183
( gasps )

14:44.184 --> 14:46.185
ARE YOU ELFING KIDDING ME?

14:46.186 --> 14:48.617
MY DEAR SWEET,
INNOCENT MEREDITH,

14:48.618 --> 14:49.619
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

14:50.620 --> 14:52.291
OF COURSE I WILL!

14:52.292 --> 14:53.963
WAIT, GUYS, AREN'T YOU
RUSHING IT A LITTLE?

14:53.964 --> 14:55.464
SHOULDN'T YOU RUN IT
BY THE KIDS FIRST?

14:55.465 --> 14:56.966
ELIOT ALREADY TOOK CARE OF THAT.

14:56.967 --> 14:58.167
YEAH, HE CALLED US LAST WEEK

14:58.168 --> 14:59.228
AND ASKED FOR OUR BLESSING.

14:59.229 --> 15:00.599
IT WAS SO SWEET.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.172
AND NO ONE TOLD SANTA?

15:03.173 --> 15:06.176
IT'S LIKE SANTA
DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.

15:10.981 --> 15:12.041
Mel: LENNOX, RYDER!

15:12.042 --> 15:14.984
CHRISTMAS MORNING.
THE SHOW GOES ON.

15:14.985 --> 15:17.216
LOTS MORE CHRISTMAS FUN

15:17.217 --> 15:18.988
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

15:18.989 --> 15:20.449
Both: MERRY CHRISTMAS.

15:20.450 --> 15:22.051
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:22.052 --> 15:24.923
OH, ELIOT'S JUST DISARMING
MY ANKLE BRACELET.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.655
A LITTLE TIN FOIL
DOES THE TRICK.

15:26.656 --> 15:28.227
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?

15:28.228 --> 15:30.961
OH, I'VE GOT PULL
WITH THE JUDGE.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.202
( chuckles ) OKAY.

15:33.203 --> 15:34.333
ALL RIGHT, ADORABLE.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.364
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH.

15:35.365 --> 15:37.166
RECESS!

15:37.167 --> 15:38.437
GOOD THING YOU GUYS

15:38.438 --> 15:40.609
BECAUSE IT IS TIME TO

15:40.610 --> 15:43.542
ACTUALLY, WE ARE GONNA DO

15:43.543 --> 15:45.114
THE OFFICIAL GIFT EXCHANGE
AT ELIOT'S HOUSE.

15:45.115 --> 15:46.445
CAN'T WAIT TO SHARE
THE EXCITING NEWS OF

16:01.291 --> 16:03.732

16:17.977 --> 16:19.448
"ABANDON AUNT MEL."

16:19.449 --> 16:20.980
THAT'S NOT ON THE LIST.

16:25.215 --> 16:27.086
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.118
YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK THE PLANES
WOULD BE TAKING OFF TODAY.

16:29.119 --> 16:31.460
NOON FLIGHT. NO,
THAT IS TERRIFIC.

16:31.461 --> 16:33.262
YEAH. I'LL TAKE A MIDDLE SEAT.

16:33.263 --> 16:34.593
WHATEVER. I DON'T CARE.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.465
PUT ME BETWEEN A CRYING BABY

16:36.466 --> 16:38.427
AND FAT GUY WITH A COUGH.

16:38.428 --> 16:39.469
THANKS.

16:42.432 --> 16:44.303
HEY, JOE.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.175
HEY, GOOD MORNING, BURKE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

16:46.176 --> 16:48.207
GOOD OLD JOE. I'M SO
GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.140
ACTUALLY, I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE AND...

16:51.141 --> 16:53.083
I HEARD PEOPLE UP.
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

16:54.414 --> 16:56.245
THEY LEFT.

16:56.246 --> 16:57.217
ALL OF THEM?

16:57.218 --> 16:58.218
YEP.

16:58.219 --> 17:00.049
YEAH, YOU MISSED ALL THE FUN.

17:00.050 --> 17:01.720
LAST NIGHT, ELIOT AND MEREDITH

17:01.721 --> 17:05.124
HAD A LOVELY CONJUGAL VISIT IN
THE GUEST ROOM NEXT TO MINE.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.656
IT WAS LIKE 10th GRADE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

17:07.757 --> 17:09.458
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN
THE BEST PART.

17:09.459 --> 17:10.659
MY SISTER

17:10.660 --> 17:13.262
JUST TOOK MY NIECE AND
NEPHEW AWAY FROM ME

17:13.263 --> 17:16.465
ON CHRISTMAS DAY.

17:16.466 --> 17:18.267
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT
ABOUT THE ANKLE THING?

17:18.268 --> 17:19.338
I MEAN, IF SHE
LEAVES THE HOUSE...

17:19.339 --> 17:21.140
FOIL, JOE. FOIL.

17:21.141 --> 17:24.213
THE ENTIRE JUSTICE SYSTEM
IS TAKEN DOWN BY TIN FOIL.

17:24.214 --> 17:26.215
BUT IT'S OKAY. I'M NOT
COMPLETELY ALONE.

17:26.216 --> 17:27.347
I STILL GOT YOU.

17:28.818 --> 17:31.350
UH... YEAH.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.482
YEP.

17:33.483 --> 17:35.285
YOU SURE DO.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.786
WAIT, WHY DID YOU BRING
YOUR SUITCASE DOWN?

17:37.787 --> 17:39.288
DID YOU GET A
FLIGHT OUT OF HERE?

17:39.289 --> 17:41.160
NO. NO, I DIDN'T GET A FLIGHT.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.161
NOPE. I WAS...

17:42.162 --> 17:43.632
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
THAT'S WISHFUL THINKING.

17:43.633 --> 17:45.634
I WANTED TO GET A FLIGHT, BUT
I COULDN'T GET A FLIGHT.

17:45.635 --> 17:47.796
SO... YEAH.

17:47.797 --> 17:50.600
SO IT'S JUST... IT'S
JUST YOU AND ME HERE.

17:52.302 --> 17:54.203
YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S NOT
WASTE THE TIME THOUGH.

17:54.204 --> 17:55.274
LET'S LOOK AT THIS
CHRISTMAS LIST OF YOURS

17:55.275 --> 17:57.146
AND SEE WHAT'S LEFT ON HERE

17:57.147 --> 17:58.477
THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.808
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? OKAY.

17:59.809 --> 18:02.611
"BIG CHRISTMAS KARAOKE
SING-ALONG WITH EVERYBODY."

18:02.612 --> 18:05.814
WE'LL JUST PUT A
PIN IN THAT ONE.

18:05.815 --> 18:07.616
OKAY, "MAKE A PEAR
TRIFLE WITH BOURBON."

18:07.617 --> 18:09.158
MIGHT BE A LITTLE EARLY
FOR BOURBON THOUGH.

18:09.159 --> 18:10.559
AH, NOT WITH THE
NIGHT SANTA HAD.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.562
WE MIGHT NOT EVEN
NEED THOSE PEARS.

18:15.225 --> 18:17.166
SHE'S GOT THE DIAMONDS.
SHE'S GOT THE FIANCE.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.767
SHE'S GOT THE KIDS.
WHAT HAVE I GOT?

18:18.768 --> 18:21.230
A BOURBON AND YOU.

18:21.231 --> 18:22.331
THANKS A LOT.

18:22.332 --> 18:24.203
HEY, I PUT YOU UP
THERE WITH BOURBON,

18:24.204 --> 18:26.535
AND THIS IS THE GOOD STUFF.

18:26.536 --> 18:28.137
THINK ABOUT IT THIS
WAY: ALL RIGHT, YES,

18:28.138 --> 18:29.478
SHE HAS THE KIDS TODAY,

18:29.479 --> 18:31.140
BUT YOU GET THE KIDS
THE REST OF THE YEAR.

18:31.141 --> 18:32.381
I MEAN, COME ON. THAT'S
NOT A BAD RATIO.

18:32.382 --> 18:33.842
YEAH, MAYBE.

18:33.843 --> 18:35.414
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST FEEL BAD

18:35.415 --> 18:37.146
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TO SEE
YOUR FAMILY THIS YEAR.

18:37.147 --> 18:38.487
OH WELL.

18:38.488 --> 18:39.618
YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.151
I MEAN LOOK, I GET
TO BE HERE WITH YOU.

18:42.152 --> 18:45.155
AND YOU KNOW, I GOT
TO SEE SANTA CLAUS.

18:46.156 --> 18:47.526
ALTHOUGH I GOTTA TELL YOU,

18:47.527 --> 18:49.758
- HE SEEMED A LITTLE UNHINGED.
- WHAT?!

18:49.759 --> 18:51.360
SANTA IS PERFECTLY HINGED.

18:51.361 --> 18:54.203
- HEY, MORE BOURBON.
- YES. OKAY.

18:54.204 --> 18:55.504
ALL RIGHT, NOW DON'T BE STINGY.
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

18:55.505 --> 18:56.835
- AH! ATTABOY. ATTABOY.
- HEY, WHOA.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.167
- LET'S MAKE IT A BLACKOUT CAKE.
- WHAT ARE YOU...?

18:58.168 --> 18:59.269
THERE YOU GO.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.141
YOU KNOW, I SAW ON THE NEWS

19:03.142 --> 19:05.314
THAT THE AIRPORT WAS
OPEN THIS MORNING.

19:05.315 --> 19:06.475
OH.

19:06.476 --> 19:09.218
WELL, YEAH. THE TOLEDO
AIRPORT WAS OPEN,

19:09.219 --> 19:10.349
BUT IF YOU HAD CHECKED
NEWARK YOU WOULD'VE SEEN...

19:10.350 --> 19:11.620
NEWARK WAS OPEN, TOO.

19:11.621 --> 19:13.482

- YOU LIED TO ME WHEN YOU SAID

19:13.483 --> 19:14.784

19:27.767 --> 19:28.768
ONE TIME A YEAR.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.371
YOU KNOW, I AM A LITTLE
CURIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.442
YEAH, WHAT?

19:42.412 --> 19:43.482
OH, COME ON.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.613
SOMEBODY TRYING TO DO SOMETHING?

19:44.614 --> 19:46.415
COME ON. GO AHEAD. I
DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

19:46.416 --> 19:47.516
I DON'T FEEL... OKAY OKAY.

19:47.517 --> 19:49.259
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S ENOUGH.

19:51.621 --> 19:54.723
HEY, ARE WE BACK IN TIME
FOR KARAOKE CAROLING?

19:54.724 --> 19:57.326

19:59.369 --> 20:00.769
WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS

20:00.770 --> 20:03.272
WE DID, BUT THEN WE WANTED
