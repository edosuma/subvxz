WEBVTT

00:05.600 --> 00:07.465
Oh, my God. She is
so cheating on him.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.104
They've only been
married six months.

00:09.140 --> 00:10.107
They seem fine.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.437
They're not.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.109
Couldn't you see, she didn't
look at him all night.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.607
I guess I wasn't
paying attention.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.346
Yeah, I guess not.

00:17.380 --> 00:18.472
Why would I
pay attention?

00:18.510 --> 00:19.477
It's their life.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.441
No, it's not!

00:20.480 --> 00:21.777
They're our
best friends.

00:21.820 --> 00:24.345
Which means whatever
happens in their life...

00:27.160 --> 00:29.151
Wayne?

00:30.330 --> 00:31.354
MAN:
And cut!

00:33.200 --> 00:35.191
MAN _:
Okay, movrng on.

00:35.230 --> 00:38.222
Quickly, people. Quickly.

00:38.270 --> 00:41.239
Is Number 1 traveling?

00:41.270 --> 00:42.305
Okay.

00:42.340 --> 00:43.762
I know, it's okay.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.209
No.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.276
We're gonna let Larry
deal with this.

00:49.550 --> 00:54.214
Mr. Weinstock, um,
he's still in there.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.389
Even after you gave him
that extra hour.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.547
Damn it.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.580
Fletcher.

01:05.630 --> 01:06.597
Fletch?

01:06.630 --> 01:09.599
Fletch? It's me-- coming in.

01:09.630 --> 01:10.619
Come on, buddy.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.331
Everybody's waiting.

01:12.370 --> 01:13.439
Fletch?

01:13.470 --> 01:15.631
Give saving the world
a break, okay...

01:32.560 --> 01:33.788
Hey. Those aren't yours.

01:33.820 --> 01:35.151
Are you sure?

01:35.190 --> 01:37.226
I just took them
out of the dryer.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.227
Uh, yeah. I'm sure.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.625
Okay, but you don't...

01:39.660 --> 01:41.196
Okay, great. They're yours.

01:41.230 --> 01:43.164
You okay?

01:43.200 --> 01:44.690
Um, not really.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.198
I'm a manny for this family
on Park Avenue,

01:47.240 --> 01:49.765
and it's my first day,
and I'm already screwing up.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.801
I have no idea which
of these clothes are theirs.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.809
What, you're a manny, but
you're, um, doing the laundry?

01:54.840 --> 01:56.705
The washing machine broke,

01:56.750 --> 01:58.604
and the maid told me to.

01:58.650 --> 02:00.572
Oh. Mine, too. Well, the
washing machine-- that part.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.769
I don't have a maid.

02:01.820 --> 02:05.711
This is Cindy's. Why are you
trying to take my kids' clothes?

02:05.750 --> 02:07.513
I'm sorry, I wasn't looking.
They got all mixed up.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.257
Oh, no. I bought these for
my Christopher's fifth birthday.

02:11.290 --> 02:12.655
$300. Get your hands off them.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.452
I just washed those.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.649
Whoa. You. Granny.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.669
Those aren't yours, and you know
it. I'm a cop, so listen up.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.463
I saw what you put into
your washing machine.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.559
You had two sets of sheets,
a terrycloth robe,

02:22.610 --> 02:23.429
three sets of pajamas,
five sheets.

02:23.470 --> 02:25.529
No kids clothes.
Give them back. And you.

02:25.570 --> 02:28.175
You did three loads--
all boys clothes.

02:28.210 --> 02:30.405
And now you suddenly need
a $100 Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt

02:30.450 --> 02:32.418
for your daughter Cindy?
Give it back.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.946
You should not be, uh, putting
that in the wash, by the way.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.582
That-that's more of
a dry clean only.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.884
Well, what are you
all staring at?

02:40.920 --> 02:42.729
Grown man doing his laundry
for the first time.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.227
Big thing to see.

02:44.260 --> 02:46.353
Whatever.
Go.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.494
Wow. It's brutal in here.

02:49.530 --> 02:50.667
Thank you.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.793
Yeah, sure.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.207
So, hey. Um,
can I take you out tonight?

02:56.240 --> 02:58.299
Just to thank you
more thoroughly.

02:58.340 --> 03:00.479
Aw, that's...

03:00.510 --> 03:02.273
Can I be honest?

03:02.310 --> 03:03.402
You're not really my type.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.542
How do you know that?

03:04.580 --> 03:06.719
Are these yours?

03:08.280 --> 03:10.441
This kind of says it all.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.653
You take those.
Have a nice day, okay?

03:13.690 --> 03:14.987
Oh.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.453
Hello?

03:16.490 --> 03:17.457
Oh, hey, Al.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.569
Even as the news sinks in,
it's hard to accept.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.364
Fletcher Sayers, whose
self-proclaimed transformation

03:26.400 --> 03:27.697
from party-hard bad boy

03:27.740 --> 03:29.867
to dedicated _ _
actor-slash-polltlcal actIVIst

03:29.910 --> 03:33.698
has been hotly debated,
is dead at 37.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.708
MAN: All right,
we're moving to Stage 22.

03:35.740 --> 03:36.946
Fletcher Sayers.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.743
Perhaps you've
heard of him?

03:38.780 --> 03:40.270
Yeah.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.584
We went to one of his movies
on our second-ever date.

03:42.620 --> 03:43.587
Oh, yeah.

03:43.620 --> 03:44.917
The time-travel one.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.316
Yep, April 17, 1999.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.588
I thought you were
gonna try to...

03:48.620 --> 03:50.884
kiss me in the
end credits.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.795
Instead, you went to,
uh, check your meter.

03:52.830 --> 03:53.797
What can I say?

03:53.830 --> 03:55.650
I'm a romantic.

04:05.970 --> 04:09.576
They said this was supposed
to be his big comeback.

04:09.610 --> 04:11.544
Guess it won't be.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.467
No obvious defensive wounds
or any other kind of struggle.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.297
I'd say the cause of death

04:32.340 --> 04:33.568
was the bullet wound

04:33.600 --> 04:34.999
that perforated
his heart.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.837
AL:
Any idea
what caliber?

04:36.870 --> 04:39.407
WEBSTER: Well, from the size of
the wounds, I'm gonna say a .38.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.408
Apparently, nobody
heard anything,

04:41.440 --> 04:43.977
so he must have
used a srlencer.

04:44.010 --> 04:46.478
AL: Phone, wallet still here,
so obviously not a robbery.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.909
WEBSTER:
This is weird. I have seen him
die a couple of times in movies.

04:48.950 --> 04:50.087
This is hard to believe.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.087
AL:
I know.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.519
Anything?

04:52.560 --> 04:53.913
His wife.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.588
WEBSTER:
AmIra Buery.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.927
Uh, they met in France.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.554
She's some kind
of human rights activist.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.023
Uh, she's the only one
he could share his soul with.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.529
Barbara Walters interview.

05:06.570 --> 05:09.437
Huh. Though he did have
quite the reputation

05:09.470 --> 05:11.529
for sharing in other ways.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.499
The Star.

05:14.540 --> 05:15.802
My dentist's waiting room.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.479
That's just gossip.
He'd changed.

05:18.510 --> 05:19.249
You're very cynical, Al.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.044
Okay. He's a movie star.
We'll see.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.012
The thing is--

05:23.050 --> 05:25.416
we tried to get Fletch
down to the set earlier,

05:25.450 --> 05:26.382
at, uh, 10:15.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.650
But he_ wouldn't come
out of hIS dressmg room.

05:28.690 --> 05:31.989
So Mr. Weinstock went
and talked...
Larry Weinstock,
the producer?

05:32.030 --> 05:33.895
Right. So Weinstock
worked it out

05:33.930 --> 05:35.454
that he'd be back out

05:35.500 --> 05:37.388
in time for the next setup.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.091
We were set up for that
around 11:30.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.438
He still wouldn't come out.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.404
That's when we went back...

05:42.440 --> 05:44.408
We found him.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.135
So who had access
to these dressrng rooms?

05:46.170 --> 05:47.637
Oh, lots of people.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.136
There's security checks
at all the gates,

05:49.180 --> 05:50.807
and cameras
on a few other external doors,

05:50.850 --> 05:52.442
but once you get
onto the stages,

05:52.480 --> 05:53.515
you can go wherever you want.

05:53.550 --> 05:55.438
MAN:
Here you go.
Thanks.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.414
Do the stages have
security cameras?

05:57.450 --> 05:59.918
They do, but we were dealing
with a brownout today.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.848
Knocked out _the
air-conditioning

06:01.890 --> 06:03.380
and a bunch
of the security cameras

06:03.430 --> 06:04.556
around 9:30 this morning.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.725
Only got 'em back online
half hour ago.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.899
You see anybody,
anything suspicious?

06:09.930 --> 06:11.124
Well, actually...

06:11.170 --> 06:13.058
I thought you might want
to take a look at this.

06:17.470 --> 06:18.903
They found this in the pocket

06:18.940 --> 06:21.033
of Sayers' folding chair
on the set.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.548
It's a Wonderful Death.
Cheery.

06:23.580 --> 06:26.447
Take a look at the note
that was attached to it.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.539
"You promised to read.
How about it?"

06:28.580 --> 06:29.911
MURRAY:
The assistant director says

06:29.950 --> 06:31.588
there were tons of people

06:31.620 --> 06:32.951
who tried to pass scripts
to Sayers.

06:32.990 --> 06:36.118
Anywhere-- the bathroom,
the elevator, the set.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.718
Some could get
pretty scary persistent.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.625
Oh, it's true.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.093
I had a medical
assrstant once,

06:41.130 --> 06:42.995
he wrote a spec
script for CSI.

06:43.030 --> 06:44.099
I told him

06:44.130 --> 06:45.563
that DNA evidence couldn't

06:45.600 --> 06:47.192
be gotten
in 15 minutes.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.504
He came at me
With a scalpel.

06:49.540 --> 06:52.737
"Written by Sam Wainwright."
We should talk to this guy.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.841
You know, that's gonna
be difficult.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.485
Sam Wainwright is a character
in It's a Wonderful Life.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.681
The writer's using a pseudonym.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.211
Wainwright was played
by Frank Albertson,

07:09.260 --> 07:10.852
who was also in Psycho,
by the way.

07:10.890 --> 07:13.222
All right, seems like
an obsessive film fan.

07:13.260 --> 07:15.728
So Jay should be searching
for someone named Albertson

07:15.760 --> 07:17.796
who has the initials F.A.

07:17.830 --> 07:20.196
And you're gonna want to talk
to a Larry Weinstock.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.128
He was the producer
of the movie,

07:22.170 --> 07:23.865
and the last one to actually
speak with Sayers.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.036
Great. Is he out there?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.970
Yeah, he gave a statement
and took off.

07:27.010 --> 07:29.843
Apparently, he's with his editor
at a post-production house.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.142
It's on 73rd.

07:31.180 --> 07:33.978
Pretty quick to get
back to work.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.544
That's all for now.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.186
We will, of course,
keep you informed. Thank you.

07:39.220 --> 07:41.518
Oh. Actually,
let her through.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.551
Tina Forbish,

07:43.590 --> 07:45.558
Cherie Rollins-Murray is
one of my lead detectives

07:45.590 --> 07:46.625
on this case.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.548
She will be interfacing
with the press

07:48.600 --> 07:50.090
as soon as we find
anything relevant.

07:50.130 --> 07:51.267
Thank you, Eliot.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.836
Absolutely.

07:52.870 --> 07:54.167
Yeah.
Thanks, Eliot.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.633
Yeah, we got to manage
these people.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.137
They're not going away
on this one.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.702
Detective Rollins-Murray.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.674
Uh, can you give us anything
on the condition of the body?

08:03.710 --> 08:05.075
We have no comment
at this time.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.714
How many times was he shot?

08:06.750 --> 08:07.842
No comment.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.144
Uh, was anyone
with Sayers at the time?

08:10.190 --> 08:12.988
I would say that,
yes, there was.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.248
Who was with him?

08:14.290 --> 08:18.556
Based on my experience, I would
say at the time he was killed,

08:18.590 --> 08:20.649
his killer was also present.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.622
That's it for now.

08:25.300 --> 08:28.133
Weinstock's assistant says
he's still not available.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.831
I'll get Jay
on a subpoena.

08:29.870 --> 08:31.098
You know what?
Forget the subpoena.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.937
I got an idea.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.834
Don't even talk
to me about gross,

08:34.880 --> 08:36.302
because my international
is down 15%.

08:36.340 --> 08:38.604
Marcus says there's plenty
of gross to be found there.

08:38.650 --> 08:39.844
Marcus has his head
up his ass.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.313
CARRIE: Hey, we're
here to see Larry.

08:41.350 --> 08:42.783
He's expecting us.
Um...

08:42.820 --> 08:43.912
Where is he?
Editing two.

08:43.950 --> 08:44.939
That way?
Mm-hmm.

08:44.990 --> 08:46.753
Awesome. Thank you!

08:46.790 --> 08:48.109
"Plenty of gross
to be had"?

08:48.160 --> 08:49.559
I'm sure it means something.

08:49.590 --> 08:50.750
SAYERS:
I tried to get away,

08:50.790 --> 08:55.022
but how far away was enough?

08:55.060 --> 08:57.722
Paris? I-I'm sorry.

08:57.770 --> 08:58.759
VVhat

08:58.800 --> 08:59.767
Mr. Weinstock.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.097
Al Burns.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.289
Carrie Wells.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.160
With Major Crimes.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.802
Andy, hold it.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.673
I told the cops at the studio
everything I knew, okay?

09:08.710 --> 09:11.042
I opened the door,
I saw he was dead, the end.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.640
Well, we just have
a few more questions for you.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.113
Like, what are you
doing back at work

09:15.150 --> 09:16.617
only four hours after
your star was murdered?

09:16.650 --> 09:19.778
This is a $140 million film,
Detectives.

09:19.820 --> 09:22.721
I got the insurance people
crawling up the studio's ass.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.284
And by "the studio's ass,"
I mean my ass.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.798
They want to see if we can
still release this thing.

09:26.830 --> 09:29.196
What happened
to Fletch is awful,

09:29.230 --> 09:30.595
but I didn't
kill him.

09:30.630 --> 09:31.858
We're gonna need
a list of people

09:31.900 --> 09:33.697
who had access to
Sayers' dressmg room.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.037
Fine. Talk to my assistant.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.731
All right, Andy.

09:36.770 --> 09:37.805
MAN:
And cut.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.205
AL:
Mr. Weinstock,
was it odd

09:39.240 --> 09:41.777
that he wouldn't come out
of hIS dressrng room?

09:41.810 --> 09:43.300
WEINSTOCK:
What? N-No.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.204
It wasn't like he was
a diva or anything.

09:45.250 --> 09:47.718
It was all this human rights
stuff he got involved in.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.014
He's on the phone to freaking
Myanmar half the day,

09:50.050 --> 09:51.711
wherever the hell that is.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.615
Did Sayers have issues
with anybody on the set?

09:53.660 --> 09:55.252
Difficult relationships?

09:55.290 --> 09:56.689
WEINSTOCK:
No. The crew liked him.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.152
So did the other actors.

09:58.190 --> 09:59.828
He was only a pain in my ass.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.225
CARRIE:
In what way?

10:01.260 --> 10:02.898
He was a young superstar
who liked to party.

10:02.930 --> 10:05.364
Couple years ago, we were
shooting in Bangkok,

10:05.400 --> 10:07.038
he got his hands on
a controlled substance,

10:07.070 --> 10:08.697
so I had to come down on him.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.664
But that was Fletcher Sayers
a long time ago.

10:11.710 --> 10:12.836
He grew up.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.769
I'm sorry. My bad.
Uh, let me go again.

10:15.810 --> 10:18.005
God, who the hell would do this?

10:18.050 --> 10:19.347
It looks like, um...

10:19.380 --> 10:21.416
he-he's having trouble
remembering his lines.

10:21.450 --> 10:22.417
Is that normal?

10:22.450 --> 10:25.783
I don't know,
maybe he was a bit distracted.

10:25.820 --> 10:27.253
This was a big picture for him.

10:27.290 --> 10:28.951
It was gonna put him
back on top.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.050
it was a new girl
who was keeping him up.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.295
But ever since he married Amira,
all that stopped.

10:37.330 --> 10:40.959
I don't know what was on his
mind, or who'd want to kill him.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.900
So, are we done?

10:42.940 --> 10:43.964
For now.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.204
We'll be in touch.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.730
Great. Hey.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.805
Let me know ifI need a lavwer,

10:48.840 --> 10:50.068
'cause I got like 50 of them.

10:51.950 --> 10:53.269
All right, Andy.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.888
He was just a good human being,
you know?

10:59.920 --> 11:01.285
People never
believed me.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.981
Why?

11:03.030 --> 11:05.021
Because of
his history.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.351
But he was different with me,

11:08.400 --> 11:09.958
here in the City.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.834
He'd left all that other
nonsense behind in LA.

11:13.870 --> 11:16.293
The five assistants, the cars

11:16.340 --> 11:18.137
and all the other trappings
of the life he'd led.

11:18.170 --> 11:20.035
Was your husband bothered
by anything recently?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.308
More than usual?

11:21.340 --> 11:23.479
No.

11:23.510 --> 11:25.171
He always had
a lot on his mind.

11:25.210 --> 11:26.814
We were moving
forward with

11:26.850 --> 11:28.340
a world hunger initiative,

11:28.380 --> 11:30.848
and he'd agreed to appear
at a number of rallies in Europe

11:30.890 --> 11:32.380
in the next
few months.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.354
But Fletch could handle it.

11:34.390 --> 11:36.881
I'm sorry, but...

11:36.930 --> 11:38.488
there was nothing more recent

11:38.530 --> 11:39.827
that might have been
distracting him?

11:39.860 --> 11:41.794
Detective,
if you're gonna tell me

11:41.830 --> 11:43.923
that you heard
he was cheating on me, please.

11:45.270 --> 11:46.931
I've heard that
from the day we got engaged.

11:46.970 --> 11:48.858
Well, there was
one particular woman.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.231
Ah.

11:50.270 --> 11:51.862
You mean the
Hungarian actress

11:51.910 --> 11:53.935
the papers can't seem
to get enough of.

11:53.980 --> 11:57.802
Yes, she's a very
beautiful woman.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.410
And would I have preferred it
if he had not gone off

12:00.450 --> 12:02.816
to shoot that silly little
art film in Budapest?

12:02.850 --> 12:04.784
Sure.

12:04.820 --> 12:07.186
But Fletch wasn't
cheating on me.

12:07.220 --> 12:08.778
I can assure you.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.856
All right.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.289
But if you think
of anything else,

12:12.330 --> 12:14.525
something he might have
mentioned, even in passing...

12:14.560 --> 12:16.790
Uh, the only thing
I can think of

12:16.830 --> 12:18.821
was when we were
haVIng a problem

12:18.870 --> 12:19.996
with this one particular fan.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.860
_ He'd been
drIVIng us crazy,

12:21.900 --> 12:24.368
going through our trash.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.878
We were going to file
a restraining order.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.434
Did you get a photo?

12:28.480 --> 12:29.902
Yes.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.444
Okay, so I tracked
down the name

12:36.480 --> 12:38.880
on the script left
on Sayers' chair.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.956
Started with all the people
who had access to the stages,

12:40.990 --> 12:42.855
and our guy--
thank you, Carrie--

12:42.890 --> 12:44.050
is named

12:44.090 --> 12:45.887
Freddy Albertson.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.022
Was this guy also

12:47.060 --> 12:48.493
the fan outside
of Sayers' house?

12:51.900 --> 12:52.935
Not the same guy.

12:52.970 --> 12:53.937
No, but I still think

12:53.970 --> 12:55.039
he looks good for it.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.162
Not only does Albertson have

12:56.200 --> 12:57.428
a collar for battery last year--

12:57.470 --> 12:59.233
beat up some guy
in the Village--

12:59.270 --> 13:01.238
but he also works for
Borough Quality Cleaning.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.874
They do all the custodial
at Downtown Media Stages.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.901
Talk about an all-access pass.

13:05.950 --> 13:07.269
Right?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.969
ALBERTSON:
Fletch was a great actor.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.988
I was a big fan.
I got to know him

13:11.020 --> 13:12.339
while I cleaned
the place, you know?

13:12.390 --> 13:13.914
Seemed like a cool guy.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.984
Said he wanted to read my stuff.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.829
Really?
'Cause a guy like Sayers

13:16.860 --> 13:18.384
has trouble finding
good material?

13:18.430 --> 13:20.352
You see that thing he did with
the alligator in the lake?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.493
Right. So...

13:22.530 --> 13:24.225
...you gave him
your screenplay to read?

13:24.270 --> 13:25.396
Except he didn't read it.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.364
We found a copy
on his chair today

13:27.400 --> 13:29.038
with your pissy little note.

13:29.070 --> 13:31.402
Yeah, I thought maybe he
just needed another copy.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.374
No, it's a bigger job.
We're moving 56 units.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.002
Wait, you thinkI killed him

13:35.040 --> 13:36.473
because he didn't
read my script?

13:36.510 --> 13:37.909
We know you got a temper,
Freddy.

13:37.950 --> 13:40.168
Sounds like you can hold
your own in a bar fight.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.347
Yeah, well, that moron was
making fun of Quentin Tarantino.

13:42.380 --> 13:44.883
The judge agreed with me
and dropped the charges.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.218
Look, ifI killed every person
that didn't read my script,

13:47.260 --> 13:49.387
I'd be, like, the biggest
mass murderer in history.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.388
_ _ MAN: _
He gIVIng you a hard tIme?

13:51.430 --> 13:53.125
Just answer their damn
questions, Albertson.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.889
Actually, just one question.

13:54.930 --> 13:55.919
Where were you this morning?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.222
Filling out

13:57.270 --> 13:58.897
insurance stuff,
like, 50 pages of it.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.932
You can ask
my supervnsor.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.200
Look, I'm not some sort
of obsessive nut, okay?

14:03.240 --> 14:05.060
I'm just a writer
trying to get ahead.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.134
Sort of the same thing.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.330
You want to talk
to somebody

14:07.380 --> 14:09.075
who's obsessed
with the guy,

14:09.110 --> 14:10.839
I found some weirdo
going through his trash.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.208
He collected things.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.014
This the guy?
Sure is.

14:17.050 --> 14:19.109
You get a name?
No, but I did
follow him home once.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.459
I was afraid he might try
to mess with Fletch.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.355
We're going to need
that address.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.028
Yeah, sure. Hey, listen,
I'm... writing this script,

14:25.060 --> 14:27.290
it's kind of
a cop drama thing.

14:27.330 --> 14:28.991
I would love
your Input.
The address, Freddy.

14:29.030 --> 14:30.167
Yeah, sure. Sorry.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.328
Albertson's supervisor
got back to me.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.008
His alibi's solid.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.474
You know, I couldn't
tell if he felt bad

14:40.510 --> 14:42.375
that Sayers was dead,
or that someone else

14:42.410 --> 14:44.139
wasn't going to read
his script now.
You know,

14:44.180 --> 14:45.477
you should
do that.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.649
Read scripts for TV
and movies and stuff.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.147
Jimmy Bodnar,
over in Brooklyn North,

14:49.180 --> 14:50.943
he consults on all
these TV shows,

14:50.990 --> 14:52.014
all these movies,
and he's making

14:52.050 --> 14:53.312
a ton of money.
Yeah, actually,

14:53.360 --> 14:55.419
I think I'd like to be
in front of the camera.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.348
Really?
Yeah, like
Gary Cooper.

14:57.390 --> 14:58.652
Always
liked him.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.123
You don't strike me
as the extrovert,

15:00.160 --> 15:01.991
actor-y type.
Well, neither
was he.

15:02.030 --> 15:03.691
Okay, I have a little
exercise for you. You ready?

15:03.730 --> 15:05.266
There's this thing
called "improv,"

15:05.300 --> 15:07.063
improvisation.
Is that what
it's called?

15:07.100 --> 15:08.294
I'm gonna give you
a scenario,

15:08.340 --> 15:10.103
you're gonna
build on it.

15:10.140 --> 15:11.368
You're gonna say,
"Yes, and..."
Yes, and...

15:11.410 --> 15:12.638
...and you can't
say no,

15:12.670 --> 15:14.137
so you can't
contradict your partner.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.078
I learned that
when we dated.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.475
All right.

15:16.510 --> 15:18.148
I'm gonna make it
easy on you.
Okay.

15:18.180 --> 15:20.114
Two cops on
a stakeout

15:20.150 --> 15:22.710
waiting for
a crazed fan.
Well, that's
what we're doing.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.547
Why don't we come up
with something...
All right,
you're contradicting me.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.081
Okay.
You're starting off
on the wrong foot.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.111
Stop directing me.
Let's do it.
Just build on
the information

15:29.160 --> 15:31.583
that I give you...
Al, that's our guy.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.495
Yes, and... we'd better
go get him, then.

15:33.530 --> 15:35.452
No, no, Al,
that is our guy.
Yes, and

15:35.500 --> 15:37.024
helooks
really guilty.
Al!

15:37.070 --> 15:38.992
That's our guy!
Hey!

15:39.030 --> 15:40.190
Lester!

15:54.320 --> 15:58.279
What you call "obsessive,"
I call theology.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.153
We all have _certain
Images or Ideas

16:01.190 --> 16:03.021
that give our lives meaning.

16:03.060 --> 16:04.288
CARRIE:
And something tells me

16:04.330 --> 16:06.753
that image, for you,
was Fletcher Sayers.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.223
And still is.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.125
If you check the infographic

16:10.170 --> 16:12.092
I created, you'll see
how all of his roles

16:12.130 --> 16:13.768
corresponded
to a moment

16:13.800 --> 16:15.461
of personal
transformation in his life.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.139
It's like a... a series

16:18.170 --> 16:19.762
of rebirths, if you will.

16:19.810 --> 16:21.573
Mr. Weberman...
Lester.

16:21.610 --> 16:23.077
Lester, you don't
really think

16:23.110 --> 16:24.998
Sayers is coming back
from the dead, do you?

16:25.050 --> 16:27.746
No, Christians already
cornered the market on that.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.145
It'll be something better.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.512
And the infographic tells...
tells you that?

16:31.550 --> 16:33.450
LESTER:
Well, I did accurately
predict his breakup

16:33.490 --> 16:34.286
from that witch,
Sheila Evans,

16:34.320 --> 16:35.787
and that he would
find the soul mate,

16:35.820 --> 16:37.082
Amira Buery.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.688
It's just underneath

16:38.730 --> 16:40.493
the butterfly sticker right...

16:40.530 --> 16:43.124
Amira told us they were about
to file a restraining order

16:43.170 --> 16:44.296
against you.

16:44.330 --> 16:46.127
That's why I ran
when you showed up.

16:46.170 --> 16:48.195
But nobody loved him
like I loved him.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.061
I understand it might be hard
for her to share him,

16:51.110 --> 16:53.032
but I thought we could
work through it.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.479
Now we'll never get the chance.

16:54.510 --> 16:55.807
CARRIE:
Lester, you are clearly

16:55.840 --> 16:57.671
the greatest living expert

16:57.710 --> 16:59.268
on Fletcher
Sayers.
That's true.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.811
Look at this.
CARRIE: Oh.

17:00.850 --> 17:02.738
Easy.
LESTER:
No, no, no.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.681
It's a prop from his reboot
of Red Badge of Courage.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.119
He actually held this.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.354
I got it off eBay.

17:08.390 --> 17:10.779
Maybe you could get some
DNA off it or something?

17:10.830 --> 17:12.752
We've got enough
of his DNA, Lester.

17:12.790 --> 17:13.791
CARRIE:
Did you notice anything

17:13.830 --> 17:16.094
out of the ordinary
while you were, you know,

17:16.130 --> 17:17.461
digging through
his trash?

17:17.500 --> 17:19.195
I'm not ashamed.
No, nor
should you be.

17:19.230 --> 17:20.731
I am not ashamed to admit

17:20.770 --> 17:22.692
that I had an entire collage

17:22.740 --> 17:24.105
dedicated to

17:24.140 --> 17:26.404
Corey Feldman
on my wall.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.132
Aanay, like I was saying,
did you notice

17:29.180 --> 17:30.147
anything out of the ordinary?

17:30.180 --> 17:32.478
Well...

17:32.510 --> 17:34.546
not exactly out of the ordinary,
because he often got

17:34.580 --> 17:37.549
threatening mail tied to his
humanitarian work, but...

17:37.590 --> 17:41.117
lately there seemed to be a lot

17:41.160 --> 17:43.082
about this coal initiative.

17:44.890 --> 17:46.323
What if you just

17:46.360 --> 17:48.157
give us the file?

17:48.200 --> 17:50.327
Oh, yeah. Sure.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.792
I can get this back, right?

17:51.830 --> 17:53.195
Yeah, sure, of course you can.

17:54.170 --> 17:55.262
You have any cards on you?

17:55.300 --> 17:56.733
Yeah.

17:56.770 --> 17:58.237
Lester, you
give us a call

17:58.270 --> 17:59.532
if you think of anything else.

17:59.570 --> 18:00.798
The card of the detectives

18:00.840 --> 18:02.239
who are solving

18:02.280 --> 18:03.872
Fletcher's
murder.

18:03.910 --> 18:05.707
This is going in a frame.

18:08.550 --> 18:10.745
So the file's full of
cease-and-desist orders,

18:10.790 --> 18:12.815
defamation threats,
all from Musgrove Power,

18:12.850 --> 18:15.159
a coal company based
in Kentucky.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.681
Now, it looks like Fletcher was
at the forefront of a movement

18:17.730 --> 18:20.119
to not only have all
the plants shut down,

18:20.160 --> 18:21.889
but to have criminal
negligence charges filed

18:21.930 --> 18:25.263
against the owner...
Lamar Musgrove.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.892
I know Musgrove
from my FBI days.

18:26.930 --> 18:28.864
We went after him
for union busting.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.060
A lot of people got hurt.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.762
We could never
tie him to anything.
Well, now might be

18:32.810 --> 18:34.232
your best chance to get him,

18:34.280 --> 18:35.907
because him and his entourage
are in town.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.249
And Fletcher

18:38.280 --> 18:39.372
ends up dead.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.616
Isn't that convenient?

18:40.650 --> 18:42.641
I'd say
a little too convenient.

18:47.490 --> 18:49.219
If you think
I'm crying any tears

18:49.260 --> 18:52.787
over some mamby-pamby actor
who got killed,

18:52.830 --> 18:54.252
you are sadly
mistaken.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.790
That boy
was a pain.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.764
Already cost me
one of my plants,

18:57.800 --> 18:59.199
was going after the others,

18:59.230 --> 19:00.663
all for no reason, I might add.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.292
No reason?

19:02.340 --> 19:05.309
Half of your employees are dying
of lung disease.

19:05.340 --> 19:06.637
Sayers gave them a voice.

19:06.670 --> 19:09.309
Ah, here we go.

19:09.340 --> 19:11.274
Big bad coal.

19:11.310 --> 19:14.768
Listen, my daddy worked
the mines for 40 years,

19:14.820 --> 19:16.845
was never si_ck
a day In hIs lIfe.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.484
What Mr. Sayers
failed to understand

19:18.520 --> 19:19.817
is we are

19:19.850 --> 19:21.556
the number one employer

19:21.590 --> 19:23.182
in southeastern Kentucky.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.323
Shutting down our plant
did nothing

19:25.360 --> 19:27.658
but take food
off of people's tables.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.952
So you're saying half of
Kentuclq might have motive?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.491
I'm saying these Hollywood types

19:32.530 --> 19:34.361
always need a new villain
to chase.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.197
Somebody like me.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.629
But what they don't see is,
where I'm from...

19:38.670 --> 19:40.228
people see me as the hero.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.702
The wages they earn
in my plants

19:41.740 --> 19:42.968
pay their mortgages.

19:43.010 --> 19:44.204
Somebody like Sayers
comes along,

19:44.250 --> 19:45.547
knocks the table over,

19:45.580 --> 19:47.343
then goes
back to his

19:47.380 --> 19:50.383
compound in Malibu or wherever,

19:50.420 --> 19:52.411
leaves us to pick up the pieces.

19:52.450 --> 19:56.250
And as the, uh... hero,

19:56.290 --> 19:57.985
you took care of the problem.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.224
Sayers. Right?

19:59.260 --> 20:01.990
I carry a grudge,

20:02.030 --> 20:03.759
but I don't kill people.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.324
I negotiate.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.395
That's why I was here
in the first place.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.930
To negotiate
with Fletcher Sayers.

20:08.970 --> 20:11.268
Indeed.
We had an appointment

20:11.310 --> 20:12.607
to meet and
dIscuss terms

20:12.640 --> 20:13.937
on the fifth.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.777
He canceled on me.
TypIcal.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.270
The infographic I created...

20:19.310 --> 20:20.516
you'll see how
all of his roles

20:20.550 --> 20:22.745
correspond to
a moment of

20:22.780 --> 20:24.782
personal transformation
in his life...

20:24.820 --> 20:26.378
Were you meeting at
a place named Joe's?

20:26.420 --> 20:28.251
No, we were gonna meet here.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.757
Fact is,
I'd had enough.

20:29.790 --> 20:31.382
I was gonna
offer to finance

20:31.430 --> 20:32.681
one of his other causes

20:32.730 --> 20:35.290
if he'd just lay off
of Musgrove Power.

20:35.330 --> 20:37.525
Well, guess you don't have
to worry about that now, do you?

20:39.070 --> 20:40.958
Sometimes I catch a break.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.467
We'll be in touch.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.408
Listen. At Lester's apartment,

20:48.440 --> 20:51.341
he had a work schedule
of Sayers',

20:51.380 --> 20:53.268
a-a call sheet.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.345
It said "August 5th, Joe's."

20:55.380 --> 20:57.940
There's gotta be 1,000
places called Joe's.

20:57.990 --> 21:01.414
Yeah, well...
Jay loves a challenge.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.484
Thanks, Jay.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.953
Well, you were right.

21:03.990 --> 21:07.027
Jay found a gas station charge
from Sayers on the same day

21:07.060 --> 21:08.755
out near the
Bruckner Expressway.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.688
Three blocks away,
there's a place called

21:10.730 --> 21:12.789
Joe's Uptown Lounge.
There you go.

21:12.830 --> 21:15.367
Sounds about as remote
as you can get.

21:23.110 --> 21:26.375
Nothing says cop
like that suit and haircut.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.809
Are you the ones
that called?

21:27.850 --> 21:29.340
Yeah. You Joe?

21:29.380 --> 21:31.416
Joe's dead 20-odd years.

21:31.450 --> 21:33.384
Cirrhosis of the liver.

21:33.420 --> 21:34.887
I have the
securIty tapes

21:34.920 --> 21:36.387
you asked for back here.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.320
What do you say, beautiful?
You want a shot?

21:38.360 --> 21:40.419
You look like
a tequila drinker.

21:40.460 --> 21:42.394
And you look like you still
live at home with your mother.

21:46.570 --> 21:49.368
I don't mean no disrespect,
but you might've noticed

21:49.400 --> 21:51.664
this ain't the kind of place
movie stars hang out in.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.007
That's the point.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.099
Your bar was the last place
anyone would expect.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.937
Technically,
we're a lounge.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.777
We have banquettes.

21:58.810 --> 22:01.370
Oh, that brings
them in, does it?
You'd be surprised.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.843
There. It's Fletcher Sayers.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.347
No! The guy from
.357 Magnum?

22:06.390 --> 22:07.857
Are you sure?

22:07.890 --> 22:09.482
Keep it going.
Let's see who he meets.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.456
Ah... right there.
Six minutes later.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.468
Hey, that's, uh...

22:17.500 --> 22:19.422
That's Sheila Evans,
his former girlfriend.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.131
He left Sheila Evans?

22:21.170 --> 22:23.559
I saw her naked
in three different movies.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.908
Man, I'll never
understand Hollywood!

22:25.940 --> 22:27.805
Yeah, maybe he was
having regrets, too, huh?

22:33.180 --> 22:36.741
JAY:
Listen, given that Sheila Evans
is dating Devon Wilson,

22:36.780 --> 22:38.987
the NBA record holder
on assault charges,

22:39.020 --> 22:41.113
I'd want to meet
on the down low, too.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.651
That sounds like you know
a lot about Sheila Evans.

22:43.690 --> 22:45.123
Well, I'm not saying we have

22:45.160 --> 22:46.889
a personal relationship
or anything, but, uh,

22:46.930 --> 22:48.818
she did happen to retweet
one of my comments

22:48.860 --> 22:50.464
on her Twitter feed.
Oh!

22:50.500 --> 22:52.525
Jay's a fan.
Nah, I'm just saying

22:52.570 --> 22:54.891
the juice cleanse that she
promotes on her Web site

22:54.940 --> 22:56.498
kind of works.

22:56.540 --> 22:57.905
Uh, guys, we got a problem.

22:57.940 --> 22:59.601
TINA: Undercover Hollywood
can now confirm

22:59.640 --> 23:01.574
that Fletcher Sayers
was meeting secretly

23:01.610 --> 23:04.977
with his ex, Sheila Evans,
in the days before his death.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.841
How the hell'd they get that?

23:06.880 --> 23:08.711
She must've followed you guys.
TINA: Amira! Amira!

23:08.750 --> 23:10.445
Is there any truth to the rumor
Just go away, please.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.946
that Fletcher was back
Please!

23:11.990 --> 23:13.116
to his old womanizing ways?

23:13.150 --> 23:16.483
Please, please,
leave me alone.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.782
Unbelievable.

23:22.700 --> 23:26.522
I'm surrendering myself
to the authorities!

23:30.540 --> 23:31.802
Hey, Al?

23:31.840 --> 23:34.001
If you need a hand...

23:34.040 --> 23:36.099
I don't understand
why my publicist

23:36.140 --> 23:37.676
and photographer
couldn't be in here.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.507
I mean, I pay them.

23:39.550 --> 23:42.815
This is part of a formal
investigation, Ms. Evans.

23:42.850 --> 23:45.546
Fine.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.455
Nice tie.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.525
I'm interested in hearing
why you met Fletcher Sayers

23:51.560 --> 23:54.449
at Joe's Lounge
on the fifth of August.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.526
And now, apparently, so is
everybody else in the world.

23:57.570 --> 24:00.562
Well, you can all...
chillax on that.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.136
He wanted the name

24:02.170 --> 24:03.569
of my immigration lavwer.

24:03.610 --> 24:04.702
Bonng.

24:04.740 --> 24:06.469
Immigration lavwer?
Yeah.

24:06.510 --> 24:09.479
I mean, he didn't say
or whatever,

24:09.510 --> 24:11.478
but since everyone's
talking about

24:11.510 --> 24:14.217
that little sweetie he met
In Hungary last month,

24:14.250 --> 24:16.138
I figured he wanted
to keep her around.

24:16.180 --> 24:19.513
I mean, that's how I got my
dual citizenship so quickly.

24:19.550 --> 24:21.256
Uh, you might want to keep that
to yourself, Sheila.

24:21.290 --> 24:23.554
Why

24:25.230 --> 24:29.758
Sayers' wife seems convinced
he'd changed his ways.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.597
Yeah, well,

24:31.630 --> 24:34.098
he didn't tell her he was
meeting with me, did he?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.937
No. And do you know why?

24:35.970 --> 24:39.201
Because a tiger doesn't
change his spots.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.038
I know Fletcher
better than anybody.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.640
He could never be true
to one woman.

24:44.680 --> 24:45.977
Where were you

24:46.010 --> 24:47.671
yesterday morning, Ms. Evans?

24:48.550 --> 24:50.541
I thought you'd never ask.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.911
Four hours getting
my extensions and color done

24:52.950 --> 24:55.214
by Francis Duchamp
at the salon.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.784
LAWYER: Feels like
we're done here.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.879
Thank you, Detectives.

25:04.330 --> 25:05.729
I don't believe that.

25:05.770 --> 25:07.169
You think she's lying?

25:07.200 --> 25:08.861
No, I'm talking about
her hair extensions.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.231
You really can't tell.

25:15.610 --> 25:17.202
Detective, can I ask you
a few questions?

25:17.240 --> 25:19.572
Ms. Forbish, we're right in the
middle of solving a murder.

25:19.610 --> 25:21.578
You need to stay
out of our way.

25:21.620 --> 25:22.973
I'm sorry.
There's this thing called

25:23.020 --> 25:24.715
freedom of the press.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.889
You are not the press.
But...

25:26.920 --> 25:29.753
I have a van. And a camera.

25:29.790 --> 25:30.984
What you just did to
Fletcher Sayers' wife,

25:31.030 --> 25:32.327
I think it was disgusting.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.123
Don't you dare
point that at me.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.593
It's okay, Sandy.

25:35.630 --> 25:38.326
Please. You bought that act?

25:38.370 --> 25:39.325
She knew
who she marrying.

25:39.370 --> 25:42.931
Fletcher Sayers was only
interested in one thing.

25:42.970 --> 25:44.562
Himself.

25:44.610 --> 25:46.009
Mr. Humanitarian? Please.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.678
We went along
on that trip he took

25:47.710 --> 25:49.575
to Haiti after the earthquake.

25:49.610 --> 25:51.646
He barely left his hotel room.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.704
We're not that different.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.570
You don't like
that we talked to Amira,

25:54.620 --> 25:56.815
but the fact is you should be
asking her the same questions.

25:56.850 --> 26:00.047
If we feel we have
to talk to her again,

26:00.090 --> 26:02.058
it'll be for one reason only.

26:02.090 --> 26:03.887
To catch the person
who killed her husband.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.727
What you're doing
is for ratings.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.159
That's the difference.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.624
And don't tell me
how to do my job.

26:14.970 --> 26:16.130
Carrie Wells.

26:16.170 --> 26:19.662
Detective? Help me.
Someone's broken in.

26:19.710 --> 26:21.132
Lester?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.136
You know where I live, right?
Can you come?

26:23.180 --> 26:24.169
Lester, listen to me.

26:24.210 --> 26:25.746
I want you to hang up the phone.

26:25.780 --> 26:27.338
I want you to call dial 911 now.

26:27.380 --> 26:30.611
I think it's too late.

26:30.650 --> 26:31.810
No!
Lester!

26:40.960 --> 26:43.667
What do you got, Jo?
Well...

26:43.700 --> 26:46.294
Fletcher was killed by a .38.

26:46.330 --> 26:47.888
I know it's early,
but I'm guessing

26:47.940 --> 26:49.760
we're looking
at identical wounds.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.064
Someone must've been looking
for something.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.702
Maybe Lester met his match.

26:53.740 --> 26:55.071
After Marilyn Monroe died,

26:55.110 --> 26:57.704
fans fought over
her used toothpicks.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.308
But they didn't
kill over them.

26:59.350 --> 27:02.717
No. They were looking
for something

27:02.750 --> 27:04.342
in particular.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.681
What you call "obsessive,"

27:07.720 --> 27:09.210
I call theology.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.091
Al?

27:14.130 --> 27:16.155
On that wall there,
there was

27:16.200 --> 27:17.792
a-a sleeve--
it had a hotel key in it.

27:17.830 --> 27:19.388
Room 1715,

27:19.430 --> 27:22.263
Seaver House. It's missing.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.359
We should head
over there, yeah?

27:24.410 --> 27:27.834
Room 1715 is currently occupied

27:27.880 --> 27:29.370
by Maureen Kajava.
Hmm.

27:29.410 --> 27:30.707
Has been for two weeks.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.775
Not Fletcher Sayers?
Definitely not.

27:32.810 --> 27:34.277
Can I see the registry?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.412
The signature
where they signed in?

27:35.450 --> 27:36.769
Uh, booked on the Internet.

27:36.820 --> 27:37.787
No signature required.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.811
Oh.
So, who's Maureen Kajava?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.809
AL:
Any idea what caliber?

27:42.860 --> 27:43.724
WEBSTER:
Well, from the size
of the wounds,

27:43.760 --> 27:45.057
I'm gonna say a .38.

27:45.090 --> 27:47.752
Mo Kajava.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.825
Mo Kajava!

27:49.860 --> 27:51.464
When celebrities, they want
to protect their privacy, right,

27:51.500 --> 27:52.922
they often check in
under a different name,

27:52.970 --> 27:55.359
an alias if you will.
That's Fletcher's room!

27:55.400 --> 27:56.765
How did you...?

27:56.800 --> 27:58.836
I'm not even gonna ask.
No, no, no, no!

27:58.870 --> 28:01.179
Maureen, Mo. Kajava, ka java.

28:01.210 --> 28:04.373
In his dressing room, he had
mocha java coffee everywhere.

28:04.410 --> 28:05.445
It's really quite simple.

28:05.480 --> 28:06.902
Simple.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.378
I want to see that room.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.308
A_L:
No suItcase.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.783
Nothing in the drawers.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.254
Soap in the bathroom
is still wrapped.

28:19.290 --> 28:21.451
It's like he barely
used this room.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.298
It appears Mr. Sayers
went in and out.

28:24.330 --> 28:26.321
But no one ever joined him.
Just housekeeping

28:26.370 --> 28:28.167
and room service. Routine.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.930
Well, he wasn't having an
affair, that's for sure.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.803
Is it just me or is it
very cold in here?

28:33.840 --> 28:35.808
Uh, it's in the
special request section

28:35.840 --> 28:37.307
on the room. Miss Kajav...

28:37.340 --> 28:39.900
Uh, Mr. Sayers required
that the room

28:39.950 --> 28:43.272
be kept at 65 degrees
at all times.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.880
WEBSTER: Well, from the size of
the wounds, I'm gonna say a .38.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.148
Apparently, nobody
heard anything,

28:47.190 --> 28:48.953
so he must have used a silencer.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.925
Wait a second.

28:51.960 --> 28:54.520
Al, there was a brownout
at the studio that kicked

28:54.560 --> 28:56.858
the air-conditioning off in
Fletcher's dressing room, right?

28:56.900 --> 28:59.323
It had been off for over
two hours when we got there.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.928
It was over 80 in there.

29:00.970 --> 29:03.188
But Weinstock said Sayers
was in his dressing room

29:03.240 --> 29:04.867
working for almost an hour.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.832
Unless he wasn't working.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.906
Unless he was already dead.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.371
And why would he lie
about that?

29:12.410 --> 29:14.014
Listen, I'm a regular guy.

29:14.050 --> 29:15.813
I see a dead body, I panic.

29:15.850 --> 29:17.044
Especially somebody
like Fletcher.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.809
I didn't know what to do.

29:18.850 --> 29:20.488
I think most regular guys
would've called 911.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.317
What were you covering for?
Nothing!

29:22.360 --> 29:23.554
I swear.
I needed a minute

29:23.590 --> 29:25.285
to collect my thoughts,
you know.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.854
No, I don't know.
You don't think

29:26.890 --> 29:28.096
I had anything to do
with his murder?

29:28.130 --> 29:29.859
Because if that's the
case, I'm gonna have

29:29.900 --> 29:31.197
to call some
of those lavwers

29:31.230 --> 29:32.959
I spoke about earlier.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.264
This is a $140 million film.

29:35.300 --> 29:37.188
MAN:
Let's tail-slate it!

29:37.240 --> 29:38.969
Mark!

29:43.440 --> 29:46.238
You should call those lavwers
you've been talking about.

29:46.280 --> 29:48.419
Because while your star was
lying dead in his dressing room,

29:48.450 --> 29:50.145
you were talking to that guy
right there.

29:50.180 --> 29:52.910
You knew exactly what to do.

29:55.990 --> 29:57.480
JAY:
Okay, so Colin Keyes.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.828
Found him through
facial recognition

29:58.860 --> 30:00.487
since Weinstock was
afraId to roll on hIm.

30:00.530 --> 30:02.589
I can see why.

30:02.630 --> 30:04.495
This guy's a notorious fixer.

30:04.530 --> 30:06.862
Gets most of his work
out of Hollywood and DC.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.162
And he's got
some serious weaponry

30:08.200 --> 30:09.531
licensed to him,

30:09.570 --> 30:11.561
including a .38-caliber handgun.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.874
Now, this guy's done a lot
of bad stuff in his day,

30:13.910 --> 30:15.309
so my guess is,
if Weinstock wanted

30:15.340 --> 30:18.207
to get rid of his star,
Keyes would be the one to do it.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.899
Doesn't make sense, though.

30:19.950 --> 30:21.577
Weinstock's all about
the bottom line.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.247
He may hate Sayers,
but the guy's

30:23.280 --> 30:25.089
starring in his movie.
He's not gonna kill him.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.987
At least not until he sees
the box office.

30:28.020 --> 30:30.887
No, Keyes was there
to clean something up.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.352
But what?

30:34.230 --> 30:35.299
You're kidding me, right?

30:35.330 --> 30:36.558
I don't ask those kinds
of questions.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.397
I come in, I do a job,
I move on.

30:38.430 --> 30:39.966
Covering up for clients

30:40.000 --> 30:42.332
caught with hookers
or drugs is one thing.

30:42.370 --> 30:44.429
You tampered with
a homicide crime scene.

30:44.470 --> 30:46.529
Prove I was in that room,
Lieutenant.

30:46.570 --> 30:48.970
The video you mentioned
only proves I was on set.

30:49.010 --> 30:52.138
Just like 200 other people.

30:52.180 --> 30:54.045
You got nothing on me.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.310
So, if we toss this very
pristine office of yours,

30:56.350 --> 30:58.545
we're not gonna find anything
from Fletcher's dressing room

30:58.590 --> 31:01.479
or Lester Weberman's
apartment, rIght?

31:01.520 --> 31:02.987
Weber-whatever,
I don't know.

31:03.020 --> 31:04.624
But listen...
I don't need this hassle.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.128
This is Weinstock's problem,
not mine.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.889
His movies suck aanay.

31:08.930 --> 31:10.898
He called me when
he found the body.

31:10.930 --> 31:13.069
Wanted me to do a generic sweep.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.636
Didn't want anything
in that room that might

31:14.670 --> 31:17.059
cause a negative blowback
to Fletcher and the movie.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.068
What did you find?
Almost nothing.

31:19.110 --> 31:22.329
A bottle of melatonin, a picture
of Fletcher and some girl.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.008
Weinstock was mostly
interested in that.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.608
He was trying to protect
Fletcher's marriage

31:26.650 --> 31:28.117
for some reason.

31:32.490 --> 31:33.957
This card was under it.

31:33.990 --> 31:36.982
Her name's Eva.

31:37.020 --> 31:40.057
What can I say?
I'm a romantic.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.078
Wait a second, this girl was

31:54.110 --> 31:55.998
on the cleaning crew
at the stages.

31:56.040 --> 31:59.168
Maybe this is who he needed
the immigration attorney for.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.417
Maybe it wasn't
the Hungarian actress.

32:01.450 --> 32:03.918
Maybe this Eva
was the new love of his life.

32:06.990 --> 32:10.050
I am telling you,
she charged my cameraman.

32:10.090 --> 32:12.024
It was very intimidating.

32:12.060 --> 32:14.051
Well, I'm very sorry.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.453
I mean, Detective Rollins-Murray

32:15.500 --> 32:18.526
can_ sometimes be a little
paSSIonate about her work.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.060
Freedom of the press

32:20.100 --> 32:23.194
is a right guaranteed
by the Constitution, Eliot.

32:23.240 --> 32:26.129
And you will find
no stronger defender

32:26.170 --> 32:27.467
of that treasured document
than me.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.478
Listen...
I want to make things right.

32:29.510 --> 32:31.398
So, how about
I propose this:

32:31.450 --> 32:34.977
When Major Crimes takes down
Fletcher Sayers' killer,

32:35.020 --> 32:38.649
I guarantee you and your crew
will be there, live.

32:38.690 --> 32:39.748
You can do that?

32:39.790 --> 32:42.179
It's my task force--
what I say goes.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.723
Eliot,
I think I speak for everyone

32:44.760 --> 32:47.752
in the press corps--
you are a man of the people.

32:47.790 --> 32:50.054
I like to think so.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.136
This is the
cleaning place?

32:54.170 --> 32:55.432
A little quiet.

32:55.470 --> 32:57.392
It's open.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.774
_Carrie and I
were just here yesterday.

33:04.810 --> 33:07.176
Cleaned out. They're gone.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.212
Hey, guys, so I've
been digging into

33:14.260 --> 33:16.148
Borough Quality Cleaning.
There's not much.

33:16.190 --> 33:18.329
Looks like they showed up about
three years ago in the city,

33:18.360 --> 33:20.487
started getting a bunch of
large cleaning contracts

33:20.530 --> 33:22.191
by underbidding
everyone else in town.

33:22.230 --> 33:23.322
How many employees?

33:23.360 --> 33:24.668
That's just the thing.

33:24.700 --> 33:27.396
As far as the IRS is concerned,
there's only six.

33:27.430 --> 33:28.761
They got to have
more than that

33:28.800 --> 33:30.495
at Downtown Media
Stages alone.

33:30.540 --> 33:32.167
Not to mention
the housekeepIng staff

33:32.210 --> 33:34.678
at Seaver House
and all the other hotels.

33:34.710 --> 33:35.802
What about Eva?

33:35.840 --> 33:37.535
Not listed as an employee.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.672
But our eager screenwriter

33:38.710 --> 33:40.405
Freddy Albertson
shows up. In fact...

33:40.450 --> 33:43.112
about a week ago,
they gave management notice

33:43.150 --> 33:45.414
at the Media Stages
and at a bunch of hotels

33:45.450 --> 33:46.610
they were canceling
their contracts.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.550
And get this:

33:48.590 --> 33:50.410
I found a
Mountain Quality Cleaning

33:50.460 --> 33:52.758
operated out of Kansas City
eight years ago.

33:52.790 --> 33:56.294
Same deal:
lots of jobs, no employees.

33:56.330 --> 33:57.695
Oh, they have employees.

33:57.730 --> 33:59.322
They're just not
paying most of them.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.463
When I was at the Bureau,
we looked into groups

34:01.500 --> 34:03.388
who were bringing young women
into the country illegally,

34:03.440 --> 34:04.532
mostly through
Eastern Europe.

34:04.570 --> 34:05.662
They get them here,

34:05.710 --> 34:07.462
take their papers
and force them

34:07.510 --> 34:08.374
to work for nothing.

34:08.410 --> 34:09.707
Now, the real employees,
like Albertson,

34:09.740 --> 34:11.401
they don't know anything.

34:11.450 --> 34:12.803
But if any of
the others complain,

34:12.850 --> 34:15.410
they threaten to turn them
over to I.C.E. or worse.

34:15.450 --> 34:16.474
Well, that's slave labor.
Right?

34:16.520 --> 34:18.818
And if Fletcher had found out
what was going on,

34:18.850 --> 34:20.511
he never would have
let that go.

34:20.550 --> 34:21.585
JAY:
Hold on, guys.

34:21.620 --> 34:24.180
I just got an e-mail from
the immigration lawyer

34:24.230 --> 34:26.448
that Sayers contacted through
his ex-girlfriend, Sheila Evans.

34:26.490 --> 34:28.151
Now, the lawyer says

34:28.200 --> 34:29.553
Sayers didn't tell him much.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.625
Just he's bringing
a group of women

34:31.670 --> 34:34.195
over the next couple of days
who need his help.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.731
So he wasn't_
haVIng an affaIr.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.863
He was trying to help
this woman

34:38.910 --> 34:41.504
He was getting ready
to blow the whole thing up.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.531
That's probably
what got him killed.

34:43.580 --> 34:45.741
When groups like this get
spooked, they just take off.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.543
They'll move their employees
all around the country

34:47.580 --> 34:49.741
until they find another
city to set up shop.

34:49.780 --> 34:51.714
Which explains
why the offices were empty.

34:51.750 --> 34:54.787
And if they get out of New York,
we may never find 'em.

34:54.820 --> 34:57.459
Seemed like a cool guy. Said
he wanted to read my stuff.

34:57.490 --> 35:00.755
AL: Really?
No, it's a bigger job.
We're moving 56 units.

35:00.790 --> 35:03.190
That guy at the cleaning office,
Malone,

35:03.230 --> 35:06.165
he was talking about
moving 56 units.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.839
He was talking
about moving people.

35:08.870 --> 35:10.462
Murray, how do they move
these girls around

35:10.500 --> 35:12.468
from place to place?
We never found out.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.808
By the time the Bureau got
there, they were gone.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.171
JAY:
A big truck, maybe?

35:16.210 --> 35:17.199
18

35:17.240 --> 35:18.548
I don't think so.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.639
Weigh stations,
inspections.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.443
I'd go smaller. Vans.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.278
I'm on it. Come on.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.788
Okay, so these are the rental
companies large enough to handle

35:27.820 --> 35:28.855
that many vans.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.209
Any way
to narrow it down?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.259
This card was under it.
Her name's Eva.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.449
Wait a second, Jay.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.559
Right there--
Emerald Van Associated.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.496
Emerald Van Associated.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.462
E-V-A.

35:45.510 --> 35:48.900
It's not her name. It's the
van company they were usmg.

35:48.940 --> 35:50.908
It's over by the East River.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.271
All right.
Let's go.

35:52.310 --> 35:54.175
Let's go.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.705
TINA:
Hold on! Wait!

36:23.810 --> 36:25.209
What's going on?

36:26.250 --> 36:27.569
We, uh... we're gonna have to...

36:27.610 --> 36:30.408
cite you for fishing
without a license.

36:30.450 --> 36:31.678
A ticket?

36:31.720 --> 36:34.780
Yeah.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.252
Did you get that?

36:49.770 --> 36:52.500
MAN:
Van and a Cadillac
coming up on your right.

37:12.490 --> 37:14.253
We got to get inside.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.256
Unit One, my men are in place.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.666
No. We start shooting, we could
have a hostage situation.

37:18.700 --> 37:20.668
Hold for now, guys.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.964
On my signal.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.536
Copy that.

37:35.850 --> 37:37.818
You know what?

37:37.850 --> 37:40.580
I got an idea.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.679
I told you this wasn't right.
You should've listened to Abby.

37:42.720 --> 37:43.880
She said 575.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.979
You told me 475.
No.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.453
Maybe it's on Tenth.
No, nothing's
on Tenth.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.298
Hey. Hi. We're looking for this
little place called J'adore,

37:51.330 --> 37:53.867
a French restaurant._
Do you know where It Is?
Yes, and a big chandelier,

37:53.900 --> 37:55.891
great bread?
Uh-huh.
Not here.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.931
Aw, I could've sworn
it was right here.
He's got no 5...

37:57.970 --> 37:59.437
You've got no sense
of direction.

37:59.470 --> 38:00.960
I mean, like, zero.
We went to Venice.

38:01.010 --> 38:02.739
We_wa_lked around and around
In CIrcles. Then we went

38:02.780 --> 38:04.372
on one of those little can...
I mean, It was just...

38:04.410 --> 38:05.547
Do you know...?

38:05.580 --> 38:06.808
He doesn't.
Now, get out of here.

38:06.850 --> 38:09.512
NYPD. You move,
you're dead.

38:09.550 --> 38:10.972
Told you this was
the right place.

38:14.390 --> 38:15.687
MAN:
Off the truck! Come on!

38:15.720 --> 38:16.880
MAN 2: All right, ladies,
off the truck. Let's go.

38:18.860 --> 38:21.693
MAN 2:
Off the truck!

38:21.730 --> 38:22.924
Move!

38:22.960 --> 38:24.359
MAN 1:
Move It.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.867
MAN 2:
You heard him! Move!

38:25.900 --> 38:26.889
All right, let's go.
Let's move.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.659
Come on, come on, come on.

38:28.700 --> 38:29.928
Move.
Little faster.

38:29.970 --> 38:32.006
Huh? Come on.
Over there.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.771
MAN:
Get down on the ground!

38:37.810 --> 38:38.970
Go, go, go!

38:57.400 --> 38:58.992
*

39:23.620 --> 39:25.759
Give me the gun.

39:26.790 --> 39:28.451
I got him. Go.

39:30.630 --> 39:32.598
Okay, this way, ladies.

39:32.630 --> 39:33.995
All right,
let's keep moving.

39:34.030 --> 39:35.531
Come on. _
Come here, ladIes.

39:35.570 --> 39:36.992
Gonna be okay.
Right over here.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.132
All right.

39:53.990 --> 39:55.958
Hi.

39:55.990 --> 39:59.050
I'm Carrie Wells.
I'm with the NYPD. It's okay.

39:59.090 --> 40:00.648
What's your name?

40:00.690 --> 40:02.658
Monika.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.895
My name is Monika.
Monika,

40:04.930 --> 40:07.125
I want you to know
that you're okay.

40:07.170 --> 40:09.559
You're gonna be safe now
because of Fletcher.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.001
He didn't die for nothing, okay?

40:14.540 --> 40:16.132
It's okay.

40:24.150 --> 40:26.687
Turns out that .38 you
took off that guy Malone

40:26.720 --> 40:28.950
matched the ballistics
for bullets that killed Fletcher

40:28.990 --> 40:30.457
and Weberman.

40:30.490 --> 40:31.923
Good work, people.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.087
Thanks for getting us some space
from that reporter.

40:34.130 --> 40:35.927
Oh, speaking of which,
they are all downstairs

40:35.960 --> 40:37.518
howling for a statement.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.959
Murray?
This one's all yours, Eliot.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.469
Al.

40:47.970 --> 40:49.528
Thank you both.

40:49.580 --> 40:52.572
And thank you from... Fletcher.

40:52.610 --> 40:53.975
We're so sorry.

40:54.010 --> 40:57.548
Maybe I could have helped
if I'd known,

40:57.580 --> 40:59.480
but I'm still in the middle
of things

40:59.520 --> 41:01.147
with immigration,
and we're under such scrutiny,

41:01.190 --> 41:03.954
he must have been afraid
any publicity

41:03.990 --> 41:05.981
would've endangered Monika.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.827
How's she doing?
I've offered her

41:07.860 --> 41:10.249
a job in our home
and, if she wants,

41:10.300 --> 41:12.268
some help
to stay in the country.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.961
The other women

41:14.000 --> 41:16.798
will all have representation
as well.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.035
Thank you again.

41:20.910 --> 41:22.730
I'll walk you out.

41:29.250 --> 41:32.014
You were right. People change.

41:32.050 --> 41:33.915
Fletcher Sayers did.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.089
Well, I guess he realized
if you find the right person,

41:36.120 --> 41:37.985
you stick with 'em, right?

41:38.020 --> 41:40.284
Yeah, but where are you gonna
find the right one?

41:40.330 --> 41:41.752
Beats me.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.756
Fact is...

41:43.800 --> 41:46.997
I'm nothing
like Fletcher Sayers.

41:47.030 --> 41:49.965
Much better actor, for one.
Um, he won an Academy Award.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.730
Come on. You saw my work
outside that van place.

41:52.770 --> 41:54.704
"Big chandelier, great bread."

41:54.740 --> 41:56.799
I definitely deserve
a nomination for that one.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.638
You know what,
forget Gary Cooper because you,

41:59.680 --> 42:02.672
you were so good, we
got to do it again.
What are you doing?

42:02.720 --> 42:05.689
Here's the deal. You're a doctor
and I am a hypochondriac.

42:05.720 --> 42:08.848
Ready? Oh, Doctor, my foot,

42:08.890 --> 42:12.053
it hurts. I can't walk on it.
Something's wrong. Am I dying?

42:12.090 --> 42:14.752
Your foot's fine.
Oh, what about my eyes?

42:14.800 --> 42:16.028
My eyes have really been
bothering me.

42:16.060 --> 42:17.823
They're all blurry.
Now that you mention it,

42:17.860 --> 42:19.066
I do see an issue.

42:19.100 --> 42:20.226
You do?
I prescrIbe
at least

42:20.270 --> 42:22.238
one drink at Gaffigan's.
Ah.

42:22.270 --> 42:25.000
Can you follow
your doctor's orders?

42:25.040 --> 42:27.031
Yeah, I can do that.
But I'm buying.

42:27.070 --> 42:28.833
Notgonna
contradict you there.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.199
All right. Fine.

42:30.240 --> 42:34.074
You know, they should do a movie
about us in Syracuse.

42:34.110 --> 42:36.772
Good beginning,
not such a great ending.

42:36.820 --> 42:39.209
Yeah

42:39.250 --> 42:41.218
How's that end?
No.

42:41.250 --> 42:43.252
No, you're gonna have to wait
to find out. No spoilers.
