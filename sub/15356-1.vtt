WEBVTT

00:46.912 --> 00:50.412
Keep breathing.

00:50.482 --> 00:53.702
Yes, you're doing well.

01:03.412 --> 01:05.510
The baby's heart rate is falling.

01:05.512 --> 01:08.531
Let's give it one final push, and if
it doesn't work, we'll prepare for surgery.

01:08.532 --> 01:10.961
Where's the guarantor?

01:10.962 --> 01:15.302
N... not here right now.

01:15.602 --> 01:19.232
October 9, 1983
Aung San Mausoleum, Burma

01:29.042 --> 01:31.841
Isn't it past 10?
The president is late.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.671
The Burmese foreign minister
was late in picking him up.

01:33.672 --> 01:36.311
He's on his way with the ambassador.

01:36.312 --> 01:38.031
I understand.

01:38.032 --> 01:41.832
Field team, report on the current situation.

03:13.792 --> 03:16.292
Get this car out of here!

03:59.842 --> 04:02.972
Congratulations, it's a little prince.

04:49.612 --> 04:52.171
Ay, those crazy bastards!

04:52.172 --> 04:55.071
It hasn't even been a few days
since the Soviets shot down the KAL plane!

04:55.072 --> 04:59.081
The nation is still in mourning
and they're basically saying, "Die! Die!"

04:59.082 --> 05:01.141
The guy already in custody...

05:01.142 --> 05:05.191
and the guy who threw the gas
grenade confessed to everything.

05:05.192 --> 05:09.431
They are from the reconnaissance team
for the North Korean Commando Unit...

05:09.432 --> 05:12.701
and the mission was to kill the president.
That's what they said.

05:12.702 --> 05:15.161
This is a declaration of war.

05:15.162 --> 05:16.851
How dare they target
a nation's head of state!

05:16.852 --> 05:18.495
Even socialist Burma

05:18.496 --> 05:20.591
immediately announced a severance
of diplomatic relations with them.

05:20.592 --> 05:22.591
And, we're doing nothing!

05:22.592 --> 05:24.591
This is a disgrace to our nation

05:24.592 --> 05:28.311
And yet, the cabinet is just tiptoeing
around, judging reactions.

05:28.312 --> 05:32.811
What the he** are they thinking?
This really...

05:32.812 --> 05:34.682
Then...

05:34.792 --> 05:38.052
Let's strike back.

05:39.942 --> 05:42.702
Do you all agree?

05:44.182 --> 05:46.711
- Yes, let's strike.
- Yes, let's do it.

05:46.712 --> 05:48.421
Why worry about how others will react?

05:48.422 --> 05:50.422
Fine.

05:52.032 --> 05:55.092
Let's hit those guys.

06:05.752 --> 06:10.782
We've decided to retaliate for the terrorist
attack at Aung San in the motherland's name.

06:10.852 --> 06:14.681
Even the president doesn't know
about Operation Clean Sweep.

06:14.682 --> 06:18.001
Only 5 people in Korea know.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.221
What's the plan?

06:20.222 --> 06:25.031
<i>Infiltrate Pyeongyang, and slit the throats
of 30 generals from the North Korean Army.</i>

06:25.032 --> 06:26.371
Are you going to do it?

06:26.372 --> 06:27.931
We can't just sit back and take this.

06:27.932 --> 06:31.572
If anyone goes, it will be me.
You stay out of it.

06:34.492 --> 06:37.802
You no longer have just yourself
to worry about.

06:48.152 --> 06:49.372
Kyung Hee.

06:49.382 --> 06:50.852
Moo Yul.

06:53.222 --> 06:55.161
It was hard on your own, wasn't it?

06:55.162 --> 06:56.672
I'm sorry.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.252
Here.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.721
Is this our son?

07:00.722 --> 07:04.172
Let's see.
He's good looking.

07:08.282 --> 07:10.161
I'm your dad.

07:10.162 --> 07:14.852
You sure took your time coming out
and put Mom through a tough time.

07:15.842 --> 07:19.052
Little Sister-in-law, you did good.

07:21.772 --> 07:24.401
Watch how you address your hyung's wife.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.201
Thank you for coming back safely.

07:27.202 --> 07:29.231
I worried so much after watching the news.

07:29.232 --> 07:32.211
- You didn't worry about me at all, did you?
- Crazy guy.

07:32.212 --> 07:34.251
Why would my wife worry about you?

07:34.252 --> 07:36.191
Jin Pyo, are you the same
as my dear husband?

07:36.192 --> 07:39.181
Aigoo, my wounded heart...

07:39.182 --> 07:42.181
I'm going to go and get myself married.
This year!

07:42.182 --> 07:43.812
Aigoo!

07:45.492 --> 07:48.981
Okay. Take good care of sister-in-law.

07:48.982 --> 07:50.452
I'm going.

07:50.462 --> 07:53.221
No, I'm going with you.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.892
Hey.

07:55.952 --> 07:59.481
I'm sorry to leave so soon after coming
back, but I have somewhere I have to go.

07:59.482 --> 08:01.601
- W... where?
- Park Moo Yul.

08:01.602 --> 08:03.467
No, that's enough.

08:03.468 --> 08:07.861
But, I won't be able to return for a while.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.421
Then, when will you be coming back?

08:09.422 --> 08:13.081
Uh, let's name the baby when I get back.

08:13.082 --> 08:18.812
We'll use my family's generational name
symbol "Sung" and come up with a nice name.

08:19.642 --> 08:23.632
- It's not a dangerous place, is it?
- Don't worry.

08:23.742 --> 08:27.332
I will absolutely come back to you.

08:31.082 --> 08:34.072
Back to our son...

08:59.992 --> 09:01.442
Attention!

09:01.452 --> 09:05.602
Explosives expert, Sergeant Lee Min Gu.

09:06.252 --> 09:11.082
Quick draw sharp shooter,
Sergeant Sung Ho Yeol.

09:13.192 --> 09:17.062
Top-ranked swordsman,
Staff Sergeant Park Ji Kwon.

09:17.102 --> 09:21.741
Kwon Sam Su, head of National Security,
currently lives in central Pyeongyang,

09:21.742 --> 09:24.981
Gyeongsang Dong District, in the
Cheollim Apartments, 2nd floor, Unit 3.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.421
- Lee Min Gu.
- Yes, Sir... Lee Min Gu!

09:26.422 --> 09:28.101
- Song Ho Yeol.
- Yes, Sir... Song Ho Yeol!

09:28.102 --> 09:29.711
You two will take this one.

09:29.712 --> 09:34.071
Finally, Commander Oh Jeong Man of the
People's Ministry Goodwill Headquarters,

09:34.072 --> 09:38.142
Lee Jin Pyo and I will take him.

09:40.232 --> 09:41.912
Attention!

09:42.102 --> 09:43.802
Salute!

09:48.492 --> 09:51.051
Indeed, you appear to be veterans.

09:51.052 --> 09:52.269
In a short amount of time,

09:52.270 --> 09:54.781
you've recaptured your forms
from the anti-North secret agent days.

09:54.782 --> 09:56.981
Please send us in, even tomorrow.

09:56.982 --> 09:59.601
Pyeongyang is as clear as
a frozen pollack belly.

09:59.602 --> 10:01.931
We don't need any additional training.

10:01.932 --> 10:04.531
All 21 of you who have answered
the motherland's call,

10:04.532 --> 10:06.091
I'm proud of you.

10:06.092 --> 10:07.741
I, Choi Yong Chan,

10:07.742 --> 10:11.351
no matter what happens,
even if I must stake my own life,

10:11.352 --> 10:16.372
stand here and promise
that I will arrange for your safe return.

10:19.802 --> 10:25.111
This, as a man, as a fellow citizen,

10:25.112 --> 10:26.921
as your senior,

10:26.922 --> 10:28.982
this is my promise to you.

10:31.682 --> 10:35.072
We promise as well.

10:43.332 --> 10:45.061
627158, Byun Jae Yoon

10:45.062 --> 10:46.961
The North Korean dog tags
haven't changed at all.

10:46.962 --> 10:49.251
If we dress in North Korean
military uniforms there,

10:49.252 --> 10:51.141
we'll look just like the
North Korean People's Army!

10:51.142 --> 10:55.012
Sergeant Lee, you look like a
People's Army soldier already.

11:00.362 --> 11:02.251
<i>You set out tomorrow at dawn.</i>

11:02.252 --> 11:04.971
<i>You'll successfully infiltrate Pyeongyang
and carry out your mission.</i>

11:04.972 --> 11:07.721
<i>Then at dawn the next day,
you'll gather at a point in Nampo Port,</i>

11:07.722 --> 11:10.861
<i>and return on the submarine we send.</i>

11:10.862 --> 11:15.471
<i>I pray you all return safely.</i>

11:15.472 --> 11:18.292
[Pyeongyang]

12:03.512 --> 12:06.341
What the he** is going on?

12:06.342 --> 12:11.042
The president does not want
to take any military action at all.

12:11.382 --> 12:16.062
Then, what about the boys we sent?

12:19.122 --> 12:21.381
This is blueberry liqueur...

12:21.382 --> 12:24.521
The country I visited only gives it
to their most honored guests.

12:24.522 --> 12:27.402
To get some for you, I...

12:38.342 --> 12:40.792
What is this?

13:06.822 --> 13:08.881
What do you mean abort the mission now?!

13:08.882 --> 13:12.191
We already sent a submarine to Nampo Port!

13:12.192 --> 13:14.071
I will talk to the president!

13:14.072 --> 13:16.191
Just a moment!

13:16.192 --> 13:18.091
In the case that we take military action,

13:18.092 --> 13:19.871
the US will dissolve...

13:19.872 --> 13:24.051
the US-Korea-Japan Security Triangle
that includes the Korean Peninsula.

13:24.052 --> 13:25.751
The US is resolute in its stance.

13:25.752 --> 13:29.601
The president too feels
that because public opinion

13:29.602 --> 13:32.391
is at its height of anti-communism fervor,

13:32.392 --> 13:35.281
there is no need to resort
to military tactics.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.541
Then what about the men we sent?

13:37.542 --> 13:40.471
What do we do about the men
who risked their lives and went in?!

13:40.472 --> 13:45.441
Well, let's think toward
the greater victory.

13:45.442 --> 13:48.612
For our nation and its people,

13:48.922 --> 13:51.241
- let them be removed without a trace...
- Unbelievable!

13:51.242 --> 13:55.121
Have you forgotten the anguish and anger we
felt while planning Operation Clean Sweep?!

13:55.122 --> 13:58.331
We have a responsibility to
bring our troops back safely!

13:58.332 --> 14:01.131
Are the troops the problem right now?

14:01.132 --> 14:02.692
Frankly,

14:02.772 --> 14:07.111
for the President, who started his career
as an appointed sports official,

14:07.112 --> 14:10.142
this is too big of a burden.

14:12.602 --> 14:16.081
Let's be honest, now.

14:16.082 --> 14:18.991
Ambassador to the US,
NIS Chief,

14:18.992 --> 14:21.351
National Defense Minister,
Finance Minister,

14:21.352 --> 14:24.431
you're all worried you will lose
your positions over this large case.

14:24.432 --> 14:27.531
- Isn't that what you're really afraid of?!
- What?!

14:27.532 --> 14:28.851
That is such...

14:28.852 --> 14:30.951
Don't you think your words
are a little harsh?

14:30.952 --> 14:32.361
So are you saying...

14:32.362 --> 14:34.921
we need to sacrifice another 21 lives?

14:34.922 --> 14:40.042
If this plan is exposed to the world,

14:40.172 --> 14:43.722
we may end up paying an even greater price.

14:44.102 --> 14:47.422
You've heard the opinions of all four of us.

14:47.932 --> 14:52.072
Now, Chief Choi, only you
are left to make a decision.

15:20.822 --> 15:22.422
Moo Yul.

15:22.612 --> 15:25.211
Wake up, you can't fall asleep.

15:25.212 --> 15:26.881
Moo Yul. Moo Yul!

15:26.882 --> 15:28.682
I'm cold.

15:29.052 --> 15:31.752
Just leave me behind...

15:42.432 --> 15:45.091
Moo Yul, the sub is here.
The sub is here.

15:45.092 --> 15:47.622
Be strong, Moo Yul!

16:15.962 --> 16:18.612
What is this?

16:26.132 --> 16:27.362
Song Su!

16:27.472 --> 16:28.862
Sung Su!

16:36.332 --> 16:37.971
We're on the same side!

16:37.972 --> 16:41.982
Why?!
We're on the same side!

18:13.032 --> 18:14.692
Moo Yul.

18:35.982 --> 18:39.652
Moo Yul! Moo Yul!

18:42.052 --> 18:44.971
Ever since I was stabbed,

18:44.972 --> 18:48.622
I was already destined to die.

18:50.762 --> 18:53.962
You must live.

18:54.252 --> 18:57.901
Please take care of Kyung Hee and my child.

18:57.902 --> 19:01.221
I don't want to.
You live and take care of them, Man!

19:01.222 --> 19:03.451
Moo Yul. Moo Yul.

19:03.452 --> 19:04.822
Moo Yul.

19:04.832 --> 19:08.552
I love you, My Friend.

19:12.532 --> 19:14.222
Moo Yul.

21:41.632 --> 21:45.902
All of them are dead?

21:47.642 --> 21:50.532
I understand.

22:14.052 --> 22:19.131
Documents pertaining to Operation
Clean Sweep have all been destroyed.

22:19.132 --> 22:22.811
And the troops sent to North Korea
will all be reported as missing persons...

22:22.812 --> 22:25.932
and their identities wiped
from the registry.

22:29.972 --> 22:31.592
Now,

22:32.172 --> 22:36.832
all that remains...
is for the 5 of us to forget.

22:40.642 --> 22:44.572
Ah, y... yes.

22:46.672 --> 22:52.382
Well, there's a party at the
American Embassy, so... well...

23:18.412 --> 23:21.541
At Hanghae, and Guwol Mountains,
chrysanthemums*. (*white: symbolic of grief)

23:21.542 --> 23:24.531
And on Seoul's Nam Mountain, too,
chrysanthemums.

23:24.532 --> 23:28.631
I've smelled them so much,
my nose is stuffed.

23:28.632 --> 23:31.191
But it seems,
you do have some conscience after all.

23:31.192 --> 23:34.962
I see you've gathered up
the dead on your desk.

23:35.572 --> 23:37.981
Your life that you promised,

23:37.982 --> 23:41.052
I've come to collect.

23:41.082 --> 23:43.012
I'm sorry.

23:43.482 --> 23:46.602
- I had no choice.
- I'm sorry?

23:46.912 --> 23:48.921
It's twenty lives.

23:48.922 --> 23:51.741
The lives of compatriots I saw shot
with my own eyes, not by the enemy,

23:51.742 --> 23:53.221
but our own side!

23:53.222 --> 23:56.841
We... weighed the lives of those 21 men,

23:56.842 --> 24:01.101
but had to choose the American promise
to protect our harbors...

24:01.102 --> 24:04.211
for the security and peace
of the Republic of Korea.

24:04.212 --> 24:07.841
Right now, that promise is the greatest
source of support for the president.

24:07.842 --> 24:10.661
It was for political power?

24:10.662 --> 24:12.921
Do you know?

24:12.922 --> 24:16.061
We can sacrifice our lives
for our motherland,

24:16.062 --> 24:19.161
but we absolutely won't sacrifice our lives
for political power.

24:19.162 --> 24:23.912
Especially for those who treat
our troops' lives like that of flies!

24:24.312 --> 24:29.022
You at least, Hyungnim, can't do this.

24:29.182 --> 24:33.972
You swore we would live or die together!

24:36.002 --> 24:37.792
Kill me.

24:42.602 --> 24:44.451
<i>Director Choi?</i>

24:44.452 --> 24:46.852
<i>Are you in there?</i>

24:48.822 --> 24:53.211
These are satellite photos
of air force bases along the Pacific Coast.

24:53.212 --> 24:55.301
Reports show that the fighter plane...

24:55.302 --> 24:58.692
that shot down the KAL plane
was launched from this base.

25:00.072 --> 25:04.922
Director Choi... Why did you leave
your window open when it's so windy?

25:08.832 --> 25:10.562
Oh...

25:10.682 --> 25:12.341
Because it felt stuffy.

25:12.342 --> 25:15.052
- All right.
- I'll go, then.

25:40.862 --> 25:44.341
<i>The debt of 20 lives
betrayed by the motherland,</i>

25:44.342 --> 25:47.462
<i>I will absolutely come to collect.</i>

25:53.272 --> 25:55.842
Here you go.

26:31.802 --> 26:33.202
My baby.

26:41.522 --> 26:45.761
No! No! Not my baby!
You can't!

26:45.762 --> 26:48.451
Baby!
Baby!

26:48.552 --> 26:50.602
Baby!

26:50.802 --> 26:52.252
You can't.

26:53.282 --> 26:57.062
Baby... Baby!

27:01.242 --> 27:03.232
No.

27:03.572 --> 27:06.481
Baby.
Baby.

27:06.482 --> 27:08.352
Baby!

27:20.942 --> 27:23.411
<i>Moo Yul is dead.</i>

27:23.412 --> 27:26.941
<i>I will take and raise the baby well.</i>

27:26.942 --> 27:30.691
<i>You can only find happiness
without this baby.</i>

27:30.692 --> 27:33.402
<i>Begin a new life.</i>

27:33.432 --> 27:36.912
<i>You must be happy.</i>

27:49.102 --> 27:52.832
Shut up!
You want to die?!

28:03.622 --> 28:07.532
Give me the baby.

28:44.122 --> 28:45.771
<i>Moo Yul...</i>

28:45.772 --> 28:49.111
<i>I named the baby Yoon Sung.</i>

28:49.112 --> 28:53.522
<i>I suppose he'll live as Lee Yoon Sung
rather than Park Yoon Sung.</i>

28:54.812 --> 29:00.722
<i>I will take the cruelest
revenge in the world.</i>

29:01.402 --> 29:05.222
<i>Because this will be my reason
for living on.</i>

29:23.902 --> 29:28.162
[10 years later
Golden Triangle area in Southeast Asia]

30:02.302 --> 30:05.391
Boss, this guy has taken out
and sold our merchandise.

30:05.392 --> 30:06.861
What should we do with him?

30:06.862 --> 30:10.861
I told you, you can sell drugs
in other places, but not in Korea.

30:10.862 --> 30:12.242
Wait!

30:21.162 --> 30:24.541
Concentrate.
Aim down the side line.

30:24.542 --> 30:26.272
One knee.

30:33.552 --> 30:35.112
Dad!

30:35.882 --> 30:40.162
Dad, I did well, didn't I?
I hit all the targets.

30:47.692 --> 30:51.022
Head, neck, chest!

30:51.302 --> 30:54.112
Otherwise, you die.

30:54.162 --> 30:57.431
Most of the kids
miss the target completely, Boss.

30:57.432 --> 30:59.892
He did really well.

31:01.112 --> 31:03.191
Take him and train him in martial arts.

31:03.192 --> 31:06.402
- Go.
- As you wish, Boss.

31:36.282 --> 31:40.092
Is that all you can do?!
Do it right!

32:23.402 --> 32:25.092
Mom?

32:30.432 --> 32:32.001
What is it?

32:32.002 --> 32:33.851
No... nothing.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.211
Hand it over.

32:35.212 --> 32:39.022
I don't have anything...

32:46.402 --> 32:49.652
Is that my mom?

32:50.602 --> 32:52.222
My mom?

32:53.472 --> 32:59.432
I wish I had a mom like Muangsuri.

33:00.862 --> 33:03.441
Why don't I have a mom?

33:03.442 --> 33:07.291
Please at least show me a picture.
Please.

33:07.292 --> 33:10.062
I told you she died.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.712
Forget her.

33:29.112 --> 33:32.042
But, it's my mom.

33:32.872 --> 33:35.792
It's my mom.

34:53.552 --> 34:57.112
Poo Chai...
Come here.

36:23.162 --> 36:25.101
- What's the problem?
- Boss...

36:25.102 --> 36:27.911
<i>A monkey stepped on a landmine.</i>

36:27.912 --> 36:30.472
Be on guard.

36:30.612 --> 36:32.122
Poo Chai!

36:32.272 --> 36:35.222
Poo Chai... Poo Chai!

37:00.902 --> 37:03.812
<i>I didn't con you!</i>

37:08.432 --> 37:10.671
I didn't do anything!

37:10.672 --> 37:12.312
Ow.

37:12.452 --> 37:14.122
Ow!

37:15.642 --> 37:19.032
Really, I... I...

37:19.712 --> 37:22.042
Just a second.

37:22.572 --> 37:26.542
Do you know how much money I lost, Punk?

37:28.852 --> 37:31.741
No! Let go!
A... Ahjussi...

37:31.742 --> 37:34.432
<i>Let me go!</i>

37:35.152 --> 37:37.602
Let me go!

37:51.502 --> 37:52.942
Yes!

37:59.472 --> 38:00.992
Hey!

38:02.352 --> 38:03.732
Hey!

38:03.742 --> 38:05.772
Hey, hey!

38:09.672 --> 38:11.222
Hey!

38:28.122 --> 38:30.251
Ahjussi...
You're Korean, right?

38:30.252 --> 38:31.672
Yes, yes.

38:31.902 --> 38:34.391
Totally wild.
This is the first time I've seen a Korean.

38:34.392 --> 38:37.561
You're Korean, too?

38:37.562 --> 38:39.341
There's quite a lot of them.

38:39.342 --> 38:41.601
- Let's go.
- Wh... where are we going?

38:41.602 --> 38:43.451
- We have to run away for starters.
- Wait.

38:43.452 --> 38:45.732
Hurry!

38:47.052 --> 38:48.491
Hurry, hurry.

38:48.492 --> 38:52.252
- Hurry, hurry.
- Hurry, hurry.

39:01.702 --> 39:03.721
Snake snake snake snake snake!
Snake snake!

39:03.722 --> 39:06.941
- Are you okay? All right, all right.
- No, no, I can't move! Hurry!

39:06.942 --> 39:08.941
- Let's hurry!
- Just a second, just a second!

39:08.942 --> 39:11.802
Oh, my gosh!

39:29.982 --> 39:32.662
Sorry, sorry!

39:36.192 --> 39:37.621
- Ahjussi. Let's go.
- Just a second!

39:37.622 --> 39:41.102
- Hurry go! Go, go, go!
- Just a second, wait!

39:49.022 --> 39:50.831
Hey, hey! Uh uh uh...

39:50.832 --> 39:54.622
Ahjussi, I swear I didn't con you!

39:55.752 --> 39:57.292
Get away.

40:00.052 --> 40:03.271
- Oh, my! Yeah?
- Ahjussi. Jump, jump.

40:03.272 --> 40:05.061
- Where do I jump to?
- Ahjussi, just jump!

40:05.062 --> 40:06.571
- Hurry up and jump!
- Just a second. Oh, my.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.841
Mommy! Mommy!

40:08.842 --> 40:11.282
Get up. Quickly!

40:13.222 --> 40:15.952
Hey! Hey, hey!

40:22.012 --> 40:24.351
- Whoa!
- What's this?

40:24.352 --> 40:27.932
Ahjussi! This way, this way.

40:30.652 --> 40:32.621
Don't move. Don't move.

40:32.622 --> 40:34.271
Oh, my gosh!

40:34.272 --> 40:36.121
- Just be still.
- Sn... snake.

40:36.122 --> 40:38.251
- Be still.
- When I'm near a snake...

40:38.252 --> 40:39.752
Oh, my God!

40:42.702 --> 40:44.642
Hey!

40:48.522 --> 40:50.462
Ah, dang...

40:51.892 --> 40:56.451
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Hey! Hey! Stop!

40:56.452 --> 40:59.072
Hey! Hey!

41:00.732 --> 41:04.351
Ay, stupid punks. They're the fools
for getting conned gambling. Punks.

41:04.352 --> 41:07.952
Stupid punks trying to settle it with force.

41:10.022 --> 41:13.042
<i>Where are we going?</i>

41:14.472 --> 41:18.261
What if you step on a landmine
while roaming around out there?

41:18.262 --> 41:19.272
And another thing.

41:19.273 --> 41:22.973
As a safety measure, didn't I tell you
to never bring in an outsider?

41:23.072 --> 41:25.071
That the moment we're discovered,
we're dead!

41:25.072 --> 41:27.601
How can I ignore someone
who was about to be killed?

41:27.602 --> 41:29.361
And a Korean at that!

41:29.362 --> 41:33.402
Whether he dies here or there,
the guy is going to die anyway.

41:33.862 --> 41:35.441
- You!
- Yes?!

41:35.442 --> 41:37.271
M... me, yes.

41:37.272 --> 41:39.922
What do you know how to do?

41:40.542 --> 41:43.291
Food...
I can cook food.

41:43.292 --> 41:47.152
I used to be a ch... chef on a ship.

41:47.362 --> 41:48.787
Shall I cook for you?

41:56.932 --> 42:00.051
It's the best, the best!

42:00.052 --> 42:04.062
Dad... It's so good.

42:04.812 --> 42:08.201
That stew, doesn't it taste like jjambbong?
[Korean Chinese seafood noodle soup]

42:08.202 --> 42:11.461
If you sauté tom yum goong ingredients
before you boil, you get that flavor.

42:11.462 --> 42:14.632
And, since you had cabbage...

42:17.692 --> 42:20.841
- What's your name?
- I'm Bae Shik Joong.

42:20.842 --> 42:22.711
Not Shik Chung, but Shik Joong.

42:22.712 --> 42:24.471
Shik for taste and Joong for heavy.

42:24.472 --> 42:27.042
My grandfather named me.

42:30.022 --> 42:31.771
- Bae Shik Joong.
- Yes, Sir?

42:31.772 --> 42:33.771
The moment you try to run away,
you die.

42:33.772 --> 42:36.492
Just rot here, cooking.

42:36.562 --> 42:38.002
Yes, Sir.

42:38.542 --> 42:42.102
Thank you.
Thank you.

42:42.692 --> 42:45.561
- Who's that?
- My dad.

42:48.312 --> 42:51.151
Is your name Poo Chai?

42:51.152 --> 42:53.151
My Korean name is Lee Yoon Sung.

42:53.152 --> 42:55.952
My name here, Poo Chai.

42:57.642 --> 42:59.892
What is this?

43:00.372 --> 43:02.641
She's really white and pretty.

43:02.642 --> 43:04.711
Who is this? Your daughter?

43:04.712 --> 43:06.221
She's pretty, isn't she?

43:06.222 --> 43:07.751
It seems you have good taste in women.

43:07.752 --> 43:10.332
Let me see.

43:10.402 --> 43:12.702
What's her name?

43:13.702 --> 43:15.052
Kim Na Na.

43:15.162 --> 43:16.902
Kim Na Na?

43:18.612 --> 43:22.472
Your last names are different.
She's not your daughter.

43:23.672 --> 43:25.381
Just a second.

43:25.382 --> 43:28.502
- Give it to me.
- Just a second.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.781
This is Dad's room.
This is mine.

43:30.782 --> 43:32.452
Come here.

43:35.912 --> 43:38.092
What is he doing?

43:38.262 --> 43:40.032
Sleeping?

43:44.952 --> 43:46.902
Boss.

43:47.252 --> 43:50.151
Lie down comfortably and...

43:50.152 --> 43:52.281
- What is it?
- Excuse me?

43:52.282 --> 43:55.541
I just wanted to tell you
to lie down comfortably and sleep...

43:55.542 --> 43:58.892
- Butt out.
- Sleep well.

44:05.202 --> 44:06.611
He just sleeps like that.

44:06.612 --> 44:09.411
He sleeps like that?
Doesn't it hurt his back?

44:09.412 --> 44:13.111
I don't know.
I've never seen him sleep lying down.

44:13.112 --> 44:14.811
How strange.

44:14.812 --> 44:16.202
Strange.

44:16.212 --> 44:18.211
Ahjussi, you can sleep here.

44:18.212 --> 44:19.871
Ah, thank you.

44:19.872 --> 44:23.252
How can he sleep like that?
It's not like he's Buddha.

44:34.362 --> 44:36.692
You want me to shoot?

44:37.522 --> 44:40.852
No way, my dad will have a fit.

44:47.402 --> 44:51.222
Hey! Please, let me go!

44:52.952 --> 44:57.062
Let go of me! Hey! Let me go!

44:58.322 --> 45:01.452
Please set me free! Release me!

45:04.132 --> 45:08.092
You know that Muangsuri's husband
ran off with drugs, right?

45:08.552 --> 45:11.051
Sir... Sir please, spare my life.

45:11.052 --> 45:12.452
Dad.

45:12.462 --> 45:13.891
Shoot right.

45:13.892 --> 45:15.931
Otherwise, Muangsuri will get hit.

45:15.932 --> 45:18.741
But Muangsuri didn't do anything wrong!

45:18.742 --> 45:20.641
The commander in the Triangle is me!

45:20.642 --> 45:23.011
And it's my law that traitors
and their families all die!

45:23.012 --> 45:26.461
Stop commanding and try being magnanimous.

45:26.462 --> 45:28.711
Try some forgiveness, Dad.

45:28.712 --> 45:32.572
Watch carefully how I enforce my law.

45:32.962 --> 45:36.472
- Sir please, spare my life.
- Dad.

45:36.612 --> 45:39.231
Please... Please.

45:39.232 --> 45:40.872
Poo Chai.

45:42.262 --> 45:45.991
Fine. I'll shoot.
I'll shoot.

45:45.992 --> 45:47.412
But,

45:47.422 --> 45:49.631
if I hit all those targets,

45:49.632 --> 45:52.212
you forgive her.

45:54.212 --> 45:55.662
All right.

45:55.822 --> 45:58.912
I'll give forgiveness a try.

47:20.992 --> 47:26.012
Really, does it make any sense
to shoot someone precious to you?

47:29.312 --> 47:32.472
This is screwed up.

47:44.202 --> 47:47.342
I suppose in that place called Seoul,

47:48.362 --> 47:51.542
you're living happily?

49:00.552 --> 49:02.492
Poo Chai.

50:17.732 --> 50:19.272
Poo Chai.

50:20.462 --> 50:21.991
Poo Chai, watch out!

50:21.992 --> 50:24.792
Don't come!

51:05.542 --> 51:07.272
Muangsuri.

51:07.362 --> 51:09.832
Muangsuri, let's go inside.

51:14.402 --> 51:16.871
Muangsuri, open your eyes!

51:16.872 --> 51:20.282
Open your eyes, please!

51:33.962 --> 51:37.532
I'm going to kill all those bastards.

51:42.732 --> 51:45.992
Yoon Sung!
You can't go alone!

52:38.522 --> 52:39.992
Poo Chai.

53:06.382 --> 53:08.221
The second you lose your rationality,

53:08.222 --> 53:12.171
you'll find yourself stepping on landmines
buried in your own backyard.

53:12.172 --> 53:14.532
D... dad.

53:14.542 --> 53:19.111
When you saved Shik Joong, you should
have eliminated all of them at the root.

53:19.112 --> 53:21.291
If you leave a sprout,

53:21.292 --> 53:23.032
you die.

54:04.202 --> 54:06.061
Dad. Dad, don't die.

54:06.062 --> 54:07.581
Dad, please!

54:07.582 --> 54:08.972
Dad!

54:08.982 --> 54:10.921
Dad, don't die!

54:10.922 --> 54:14.462
Dad!
Dad, please!

54:18.112 --> 54:22.332
Dad! I'm sorry.

54:24.582 --> 54:26.972
Don't cry.

54:26.982 --> 54:31.002
A leg in exchange for your life...
it's worth it.

54:31.722 --> 54:33.361
Take this drug.

54:33.362 --> 54:35.781
I will remove the shrapnel
and stitch it fast.

54:35.782 --> 54:38.281
You're losing too much blood.

54:38.282 --> 54:40.711
- Knife.
- Knife?

54:40.712 --> 54:43.672
Knife, knife...

54:46.092 --> 54:50.961
My left shoulder, there's a bullet wound.

54:50.962 --> 54:52.942
Cut there.

54:53.022 --> 54:54.991
- Dad...
- Just cut.

54:54.992 --> 54:56.851
Immediately!

54:56.852 --> 55:01.572
If you dig in there, there's a bullet.

55:26.812 --> 55:28.602
Yoon Sung.

55:28.862 --> 55:34.652
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

55:37.662 --> 55:42.062
It's about your birth father.

55:43.512 --> 55:45.032
Dad.

55:46.192 --> 55:48.861
What do you mean my birth father?

55:48.862 --> 55:52.212
17 years ago,

55:54.212 --> 55:59.382
there were 20 lives betrayed
by the motherland.

56:01.402 --> 56:05.711
Your father who was wounded
during the operation,

56:05.712 --> 56:12.457
took a bullet for me to save my life.

56:16.532 --> 56:19.462
That bullet...

56:20.622 --> 56:24.151
pierced through your father's heart,

56:24.152 --> 56:27.922
and became embedded in my shoulder.

56:31.232 --> 56:35.012
The reason I lived with such ferocity...

56:35.862 --> 56:39.912
was for your father who died in my stead,

56:42.522 --> 56:46.172
to take revenge for him.

56:49.502 --> 56:51.122
Yoon Sung.

56:52.392 --> 56:55.082
You stay alive.

56:57.202 --> 57:05.042
And nail a bullet into the heart
of your father's and my enemy.

57:05.112 --> 57:07.542
That's why...

57:10.452 --> 57:16.132
That's why you trained me so severely?

57:17.472 --> 57:20.092
To take revenge?

57:22.412 --> 57:23.692
Dad.

57:23.702 --> 57:26.411
We have to operate quickly.
It becomes life-threatening.

57:26.412 --> 57:29.671
- Come on, we have to operate.
- Dad, save my dad. Dad.

57:29.672 --> 57:32.331
Hurry, save my dad.

57:32.332 --> 57:34.042
Dad.

57:50.312 --> 57:54.252
Poo Chai, come here.

58:16.552 --> 58:19.322
Moo Yul, don't die.

58:22.592 --> 58:24.222
Kyung Hee...

58:25.752 --> 58:27.312
I'm sorry.

58:28.352 --> 58:31.242
I had no choice.

58:58.202 --> 59:01.732
Who's the bastard
who killed my birth father?

59:05.132 --> 59:08.032
There are 5 men.

59:08.782 --> 59:11.772
If I kill all 5 of them,

59:12.812 --> 59:15.622
can you and I...

59:16.402 --> 59:19.942
go somewhere no one knows and start over...

59:20.742 --> 59:23.722
and live happily?

59:26.792 --> 59:29.952
Let me ask you one last thing.

59:32.932 --> 59:34.642
My mom...

59:38.682 --> 59:41.342
Is she alive?

59:45.782 --> 59:48.112
She is alive.

01:00:10.602 --> 01:00:13.332
I'm going to change now.

01:00:17.472 --> 01:00:20.092
That is my destiny.

01:00:30.622 --> 01:00:34.012
[7 Years Later
Republic of Korea]

01:01:12.772 --> 01:01:14.212
Hello?

01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:16.311
<i>So, you've arrived.</i>

01:01:16.312 --> 01:01:17.871
Yes... Just a little bit ago.

01:01:17.872 --> 01:01:19.751
<i>The first guy you need to find...</i>

01:01:19.752 --> 01:01:22.071
<i>of the 5 man committee is Lee Kyung Wan.</i>

01:01:22.072 --> 01:01:24.211
<i>You can now forget about the
years you lived in the US.</i>

01:01:24.212 --> 01:01:28.511
<i>But, you cannot forget
about your father's death.</i>

01:01:28.512 --> 01:01:29.912
Yes.

01:01:36.212 --> 01:01:39.122
Please stop the car for a moment.

01:02:15.882 --> 01:02:18.211
<i>Don't love anyone.</i>

01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:20.591
<i>If you're true identity gets exposed,</i>

01:02:20.592 --> 01:02:24.872
<i>you and those around you
will be awash with blood.</i>

01:03:25.232 --> 01:03:28.161
<i>Ahjussi! Do you really have no clue
who you should and shouldn't go up against?!</i>

01:03:28.162 --> 01:03:30.591
<i>You... you are a Blue House bodyguard?</i>

01:03:30.592 --> 01:03:33.971
<i>The president's youngest daughter, Miss Choi
Da Hye, has a temper that's quite unique.</i>

01:03:33.972 --> 01:03:36.891
Professor Lee Yoon Sang,
please give me private lessons.

01:03:36.892 --> 01:03:38.951
<i>Please save my father!</i>

01:03:38.952 --> 01:03:41.711
Let's have that surgery.
I paid the bill, so operate.

01:03:41.712 --> 01:03:45.151
The tax revenue that you can't even use,
just give it to me.

01:03:45.152 --> 01:03:47.101
<i>Issue a warrant for those three people,
including Lee Kyung Hwan.</i>

01:03:47.102 --> 01:03:48.901
<i>What's your reason
for sending me to the Blue House.</i>

01:03:48.902 --> 01:03:51.471
<i>Those guys are different
to the very marrow of their bones.</i>

01:03:51.472 --> 01:03:56.401
I, Lee Kyung Wan, am telling you
I have never accepted a single won!
