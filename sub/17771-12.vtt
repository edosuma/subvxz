WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.667
(Ryan)
Previously on Mech-X4...

00:04.750 --> 00:07.000
I'm in hiding...
or probably dead.

00:07.083 --> 00:08.792
Dead would be a bummer.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.583
Bam, y'all! We got a match.

00:10.667 --> 00:13.125
Leo Mendel, finally a name!

00:13.208 --> 00:14.834
The Harper Grant
for Young Futurists.

00:14.917 --> 00:16.583
-Got a nice ring to it, right?
-Hm.

00:16.667 --> 00:20.458
Once I get to Harper's, I know I can
get us everything we need to find Leo.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.959
You have to keep
your identity a secret.

00:22.041 --> 00:24.667
If they know you're in there,
these people will strike directly at you

00:24.750 --> 00:26.792
and everyone you know.

00:26.875 --> 00:29.458
(Mastermind) You're the only one now
who can tell me who the pilots are.

00:29.542 --> 00:31.875
I will figure out a way
to make you talk.

00:31.959 --> 00:34.250
(Ryan) I want to believe
that Leo is still out there.

00:34.333 --> 00:37.417
(Harris) I mapped the coordinates
based on the data we got from Leo OS.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.792
So that could be a problem.

00:45.083 --> 00:47.166
(Mastermind Waveform)
New manacles too tight?

00:47.250 --> 00:49.458
That's what happens
when you try to escape.

00:49.542 --> 00:51.709
What did you expect?

00:51.792 --> 00:56.583
Room service here stinks. I ordered
a grilled cheese like, three years ago.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.417
Just tell me who the technopath is.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.125
Once Mech-X4 is destroyed

01:02.208 --> 01:04.667
and I have the gel I need,
I'll let you go.

01:04.750 --> 01:08.917
Okay, so you want me to let you know
the name of the only person

01:09.000 --> 01:13.083
who stands between you and total,
utter oblivion for the entire world?

01:13.166 --> 01:14.834
I...

01:14.917 --> 01:17.333
Hard pass. No.

01:17.417 --> 01:19.750
You know you're on
the ocean floor now.

01:19.834 --> 01:23.417
No one is coming to save you.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.542
No one even knows you're here.

01:27.458 --> 01:28.792
Think it over, Leo.

01:34.625 --> 01:36.709
(beeping)

01:36.792 --> 01:38.125
Since I won the Harper Grant...

01:38.208 --> 01:39.959
-(groans)
-...I've been using their satellites

01:40.041 --> 01:41.792
to do a little recon
on Leo's location.

01:42.917 --> 01:44.625
An underwater base?

01:44.709 --> 01:46.333
That's where Leo has to be.

01:46.417 --> 01:49.125
(Harris) And with a few mods,
we can take Mech-X4 underwater.

01:49.208 --> 01:53.041
So, the tech from Mech-X3
can give the 'bot a submarine mode?

01:53.125 --> 01:56.792
Yeah, but...
Tell him, Harris.

01:56.875 --> 01:59.375
(sighs) It won't protect the robot
from the intense pressure there.

01:59.458 --> 02:00.959
It can't go below crush depth.

02:01.041 --> 02:03.250
"Crush Depth!"
Awesome band name. Calling it.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.917
If you go below it,
you'll get squished and die.

02:06.041 --> 02:10.583
"Squished and Die!"
First song we drop, calling it! Yes!

02:10.667 --> 02:13.917
Which is why I perfected
and miniaturized these Mech-Links.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.458
Think of it like a little bit
of Mech-X4, on your wrist.

02:18.083 --> 02:20.375
They're fashionable
and technological.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.667
(wristbands chime)

02:26.750 --> 02:29.917
The Mech-Link has
a few key functions already built in.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.667
Whoa!

02:32.750 --> 02:34.917
Force field, very cool.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.750
To swim from Mech-X4
to the prison,

02:36.834 --> 02:39.875
it'll provide limited air, protection,
and propel us through the water,

02:39.959 --> 02:41.875
like a private
underwater hamster ball.

02:41.959 --> 02:43.333
-(beeps)
-Whoa.

02:43.417 --> 02:45.458
And we can call each other
on a secure channel.

02:48.542 --> 02:50.166
Just wondering...

02:50.250 --> 02:53.208
How would I block three freshman
from calling me on this?

02:55.750 --> 02:59.583
Best of all, I never would have perfected
it if I didn't win the Harper Grant.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.709
(groans)

03:01.792 --> 03:04.750
Ever since you got that Harper Grant,
you never hang out with us anymore.

03:04.834 --> 03:06.792
-That's not true.
-It's kind of true.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.375
I like it when you're not around.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.083
(Ryan)
Guys, can we focus? Okay?

03:11.166 --> 03:12.667
Leo knows everything about me.

03:12.750 --> 03:15.917
He knows about the adoption, how I
became a technopath, I want answers.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.125
Slow down, Ryan.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.834
We could be facing
a number of underwater threats.

03:19.917 --> 03:22.333
I'll commandeer a satellite
and scan the area.

03:22.417 --> 03:23.500
It may take a few days.

03:23.583 --> 03:24.834
Leo might not have
a few days.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.166
(Mark)
You don't know that.

03:26.250 --> 03:29.166
Let nerdo do his nerdstuff,
and then we'll go.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.917
Leo might be hurt,
or much worse.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.667
We have this cool new tech
and this cool new robot mod.

03:33.750 --> 03:34.792
We're going.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.917
Let's get Leo.

03:38.166 --> 03:39.709
(theme music playing)

04:02.750 --> 04:04.333
(indistinct chattering)

04:12.583 --> 04:13.917
Whoa.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.750
Harris, you work
in a fun house.

04:17.834 --> 04:22.041
Um... I mean, it's no big robot
where you can hang out with friends.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.667
So what's the emergency?

04:25.709 --> 04:27.542
I've been using
the Harper satellites

04:27.625 --> 04:30.041
to scan the route to Leo's location,
and I got this.

04:30.125 --> 04:33.083
You'll have to navigate through some
pretty dangerous underwater terrain

04:33.166 --> 04:34.625
to get to the base.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.625
Since Ryan wants to leave
right away,

04:36.709 --> 04:39.667
I have no time to upgrade Mech-X4
with deep-water scanning.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.208
You'll be blind down there,

04:41.291 --> 04:43.625
so I'll have to stay up here
and guide you remotely.

04:43.709 --> 04:45.875
Which means you'll be
staying at Harper's.

04:45.959 --> 04:46.959
Shocking!

04:47.959 --> 04:49.333
Just admit it,
you like it here better.

04:49.417 --> 04:50.625
Okay, that's not true.

04:50.709 --> 04:52.333
-Salutations.
-Whoa!

04:52.417 --> 04:53.417
(Spyder)
What'd he call me?

04:53.583 --> 04:56.166
Spyder,
this is my lab partner, Augie.

04:56.375 --> 04:57.792
"Lab partner"?

04:57.875 --> 05:00.250
I prefer the term "R&DBs."

05:00.333 --> 05:02.125
Research and development buds.

05:02.208 --> 05:03.625
-"Buds"?
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.125
-As in buddies?
-That's right.

05:06.208 --> 05:09.208
We've already applied
for three patents together.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.375
And invented a video game
even moms like.

05:11.458 --> 05:12.875
What's the point of that?

05:13.959 --> 05:15.458
Aug, can you give us a minute?

05:15.542 --> 05:18.125
My friend has an embarrassing mole
he needs me to see.

05:18.208 --> 05:20.291
Oh, I know how that is.

05:20.375 --> 05:23.166
Okay, ees ouy retal.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.417
I said "See you later."

05:25.500 --> 05:27.750
Sometimes we speak
in backwards phonetics.

05:28.792 --> 05:31.166
(Both)
Za-za-zooey!

05:33.041 --> 05:34.458
Isn't he great?

05:34.542 --> 05:37.500
Now I know why you haven't been
hanging out with us anymore.

05:37.583 --> 05:40.083
You've been friend-cheating
with fa-fa-freaky.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.458
Okay, that's ridiculous.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.792
Are Augie's quirky habits
amusing?

05:44.875 --> 05:47.625
Yes. Is he like the brain brother
I never had?

05:48.834 --> 05:50.125
Maybe.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.375
Is this you trying to be reassuring?

05:53.458 --> 05:54.583
'Cause you stink at it!

05:54.667 --> 05:56.542
You like Augie better than me.

05:56.625 --> 05:57.709
He's your best friend...

05:57.792 --> 05:59.375
What the...?

05:59.458 --> 06:01.625
(Harris) The Mech-Link also has
a limited stealth mode

06:01.709 --> 06:03.000
in case you run into trouble.

06:03.083 --> 06:04.792
Nope, not even close.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.458
I will not be cheated on!

06:06.542 --> 06:07.542
-(slap)
-Ah!

06:07.625 --> 06:09.083
(Harris)
Get ahold of yourself, son!

06:09.166 --> 06:11.709
Ow.

06:11.792 --> 06:13.667
(Mark) Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.917
It's so dark and dangerous
where we're going

06:16.041 --> 06:17.959
that we need Harris to be our GPS?

06:18.041 --> 06:19.917
-Yes.
-Because...

06:20.000 --> 06:23.458
you're in so much of a hurry that you
won't let him install an actual GPS?

06:23.542 --> 06:26.166
Technically, since we're under
the sea, it would be a Sea-PS.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.542
Shut it. Okay?
It's too dangerous.

06:28.625 --> 06:29.792
We can't do this.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.375
Mark, I...

06:33.458 --> 06:35.834
I've waited long enough for answers.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.333
It's time I got them.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.250
Okay.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.500
But if anything goes wrong...

06:42.583 --> 06:44.166
We bounce. I got it.

06:45.667 --> 06:46.917
All right.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.000
This is awesome!

07:26.166 --> 07:28.542
Sub mode, engage!

07:30.041 --> 07:32.291
Don't... Don't do catchphrases.

07:32.375 --> 07:35.125
Yeah. Catchphrases
aren't my thing.

07:35.208 --> 07:36.458
Yeah, mm-mm.

07:46.875 --> 07:50.583
(whale bellowing)

07:51.792 --> 07:54.750
Aw! So noble.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.041
-(whale squeals)
-Ah! My ears, that hurts!

08:00.208 --> 08:01.625
So loud.

08:01.709 --> 08:03.917
Oh, it's talking.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.500
(sighs) So majestic.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.875
And we dive.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.250
Okay, we're at 5,000 feet.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.875
The pressure is building.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.375
All right, have you
got us on your monitors?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.083
I can't see anything.

08:27.166 --> 08:30.166
Harris, you're gonna have to
guide us through this mess.

08:30.250 --> 08:31.709
(Spyder) Oh, hi, Harris.

08:31.792 --> 08:36.333
So glad you could rip yourself away
from Augie and help us not die.

08:36.417 --> 08:38.291
(sighs) Ignoring that.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.542
Ryan, lower Mech-X4
about five feet

08:40.625 --> 08:42.083
and shift left 50 degrees.

08:52.542 --> 08:55.166
Careful, Ryan,
we're almost at crush depth.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.583
(Harris)
This next part is tricky.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.083
Just keep going straight until...

08:58.166 --> 09:00.000
Wait.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.709
-Hey, Ryan! Watch out!
-Whoa!

09:03.792 --> 09:06.959
No, stop! That's a mine.
That is totally a mine.

09:07.959 --> 09:10.333
Actually, that's a lot of mines.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.542
Mines?

09:23.625 --> 09:26.208
We're surrounded by explosives.

09:28.959 --> 09:29.959
What do we do now?

09:30.041 --> 09:31.542
How about we go back in time

09:31.625 --> 09:33.083
so I can upgrade the scanners

09:33.166 --> 09:35.417
and then we can go on this crazy
underwater mission.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.834
Wait, um, can we
actually do that?

09:37.917 --> 09:39.166
What?

09:39.250 --> 09:40.875
This is the part where we go home.

09:40.959 --> 09:42.667
No. Don't you get it?

09:42.750 --> 09:44.667
If they're using mines
to keep us out,

09:44.750 --> 09:46.875
that means Leo's in there
and we have to get in.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.667
(sighs) Harris, can we do anything?

09:50.750 --> 09:53.500
Maybe try sending
a few sonar pings.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.792
I can probably make the map of
where the mines are.

09:55.875 --> 09:57.041
Probably?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.709
(pinging)

10:02.208 --> 10:03.625
Go about...

10:03.709 --> 10:05.333
100 feet to your left.

10:08.583 --> 10:11.500
(pinging)

10:13.250 --> 10:15.750
See? We can totally do this.

10:17.125 --> 10:19.709
Good. Now, just keep
moving forward...

10:19.792 --> 10:21.709
(static crackles)

10:21.792 --> 10:22.709
(power whirs)

10:22.792 --> 10:24.583
-What the...
-Salutations.

10:24.667 --> 10:25.667
(shrieks)

10:26.709 --> 10:28.375
What?
Everything just shut down.

10:28.458 --> 10:30.291
Why did everything
just shut down?

10:30.375 --> 10:32.041
It's "Tech-free Tuesday."

10:32.125 --> 10:35.792
Every Tuesday, Harper turns off
all of our tech so that we can compute

10:35.875 --> 10:37.750
with our minds.

10:37.834 --> 10:40.166
Now, come on.
Harper's calling for one of his big

10:40.250 --> 10:42.500
Idea-rama Team-Building Brain-a-rangs.

10:42.583 --> 10:44.375
But I was working
on something important.

10:44.458 --> 10:47.375
Well, if it's really important, I could
turn the power back on to help you.

10:47.458 --> 10:50.417
We all can, we'll make it
like a team-building exercise.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.875
Uh, no, no.

10:51.959 --> 10:53.583
It's okay. Let's go.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.917
Cool. Za-za-zooey.

10:59.375 --> 11:00.625
(sighs)

11:01.834 --> 11:03.667
Guys, I'll be right back.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.375
Don't do anything stupid.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.000
(static crackles)

11:09.041 --> 11:11.542
Harris? Harris?

11:12.875 --> 11:15.291
(sighs) I'm going through.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.208
What? That's stupid!

11:17.291 --> 11:18.875
You could hit a mine,
drown us all.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.583
Harris is MIA.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.875
You said if anything goes wrong,
we go home.

11:23.959 --> 11:25.375
Let's go home.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.583
But I'm already
halfway through the minefield.

11:27.667 --> 11:28.917
What?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.959
Well, I have been moving forward since you
said, "Dude, you could hit a mine!"

11:34.458 --> 11:35.917
And have we hit a mine?

11:38.709 --> 11:39.875
Yet?

11:41.792 --> 11:44.291
(Harper) All right, people,
let's work those brains!

11:44.375 --> 11:46.250
Don't think, just jump!

11:46.333 --> 11:48.083
Just jump, just jump. Guys!

11:48.166 --> 11:50.834
I need you
to bounce those ideas free.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.417
Okay, uh... cold fusion.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.208
-Yes!
-Nano-bot hot tubs!

11:54.291 --> 11:56.291
-Love it!
-Quantum ear cleaners!

11:56.375 --> 11:58.709
-Keep it coming.
-(gasps) This really works.

11:59.709 --> 12:02.875
Harris! I need you
to commit, son.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.417
Come on!

12:04.500 --> 12:06.291
Not the time, not the time.

12:06.375 --> 12:09.083
Friends in trouble.
I have an idea. Whoa!

12:10.083 --> 12:11.709
Ooh!

12:11.792 --> 12:12.792
-(Harris) Ah!
-Whoa!

12:12.875 --> 12:14.458
Um... ow!

12:14.542 --> 12:15.709
You okay?

12:15.792 --> 12:18.375
No. I just fell
on it funny.

12:18.458 --> 12:19.667
I'm fine.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.667
But I'm gonna go get it checked out
by the nurse.

12:21.750 --> 12:22.875
All right, you do that.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.583
Everybody else,
off the tramps.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.250
Those things
are a liability.

12:28.750 --> 12:31.291
Guys, hold tight.
I'm headed to my computer.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.041
(metal screeching)

12:42.834 --> 12:45.542
Ah! Haha! See?
Told you, nothing to worry...

12:45.625 --> 12:46.917
Are you nuts?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.417
Head for the surface, now.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.500
No, but... the station
is right there.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.083
A few more mines,
and we're there.

12:52.166 --> 12:54.834
I'm not playing, turn the robot around
and let's go home.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.625
And calibrate the backup
generator I just made.

13:05.709 --> 13:07.667
(generator whirring)

13:08.792 --> 13:10.750
Yes! That's good,
the power's back on.

13:11.875 --> 13:12.917
(beeping)

13:13.041 --> 13:15.291
That's not good.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.875
(Harris) What's going on down there?
You guys are drifting into the mines.

13:19.834 --> 13:21.166
(Both)
Your fault!

13:22.750 --> 13:25.834
(screaming)

13:35.709 --> 13:36.959
(power whirring)

13:50.542 --> 13:52.333
Ugh! Is everyone okay?

13:54.291 --> 13:56.667
Well, uh, some water

13:56.750 --> 13:58.625
may have gotten inside

13:58.709 --> 14:00.834
and gotten into my pants.

14:01.792 --> 14:03.458
I'll get the emergency power back on.

14:07.375 --> 14:09.667
(power whirs)

14:09.750 --> 14:12.625
(Harris) That blast took out most
of your power and your right propeller.

14:12.709 --> 14:14.083
What's the good news?

14:14.166 --> 14:16.667
Who said there was good news?
You're below crush depth.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.709
You have ten minutes
to get out of there.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.041
Or we get squished
into meat paste.

14:21.125 --> 14:24.750
(metallic creaking)

14:24.834 --> 14:27.709
Okay, I'm gonna use the Mech-Link
and go get Leo. It's now or never.

14:27.792 --> 14:29.000
Still with this?

14:29.083 --> 14:30.834
This is what we came here to do.

14:30.917 --> 14:34.208
You just get Mech-X4 working again
before the pressure destroys it.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.625
Mark, please?

14:39.500 --> 14:41.834
Hey, good luck.

14:49.875 --> 14:51.375
Spyder, give me your Mech-Link.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.083
My Mech-Link? Why?

14:53.166 --> 14:55.250
Because Leo's gonna need
a force field to get back.

14:56.959 --> 14:58.834
And also, if...

14:58.917 --> 15:01.166
if I don't make it back, can you just...

15:01.250 --> 15:05.083
(sighs) can you tell Mark
that this was important to me?

15:05.166 --> 15:06.500
And, um...

15:06.583 --> 15:08.125
-You're sorry for being a jerk.
-Yeah.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.125
Wait. I was a jerk?

15:11.208 --> 15:12.750
Dude, we're sinking.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.959
You brought us
to our watery grave.

15:15.750 --> 15:18.458
Hey, at least
I'm doing it with friends.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.917
Cameras? I don't think so.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.083
Lights out.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.834
(Harris) The robot can't move
until you restore full power.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.834
Ooh, not there!

16:07.542 --> 16:09.417
-(electricity buzzes)
-Not there!

16:09.500 --> 16:11.875
Come on, the outer armor's
getting crushed. Focus!

16:11.959 --> 16:16.458
I am focused... on keeping Ryan safe,
on keeping us from drowning.

16:16.542 --> 16:17.792
Why doesn't he understand that?

16:19.041 --> 16:20.917
-Here?
-Yes.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.959
Now he's out there all by himself.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.458
Wait! To your left.

16:28.375 --> 16:30.083
(alarm blaring)

16:47.583 --> 16:49.041
(groans)

16:49.125 --> 16:50.959
What did you do that for?

16:52.083 --> 16:53.333
(groans)

16:56.291 --> 16:57.834
(groans)

16:57.917 --> 17:00.083
-Sir, we are under attack.
-(beeps)

17:01.709 --> 17:03.000
(buzzing)

17:04.375 --> 17:05.959
(grunting)

17:06.041 --> 17:07.458
(groans)

17:07.542 --> 17:08.792
Ah!

17:12.917 --> 17:14.375
(screams)

17:20.625 --> 17:22.333
Oh, hurry up, Ryan.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.792
-I'm too young to lose my best friend.
-(metallic creaking)

17:25.417 --> 17:26.834
Hurry up, Mark!

17:26.917 --> 17:29.417
Ryan's too young
to lose his best friend!

17:33.125 --> 17:35.458
(sighs) Look, I get
what you're going through.

17:35.542 --> 17:39.041
I mean, Spyder's been
kind of a jerk to me all day

17:39.125 --> 17:40.208
for no reason.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.500
Well, he sort of has a reason.

17:42.583 --> 17:43.500
Go on.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.000
I mean, dude,

17:45.083 --> 17:48.375
it's been Harper, Harper, Harper
since you got that grant.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.583
Oh, I guess that's true.

17:50.667 --> 17:54.083
It's been Leo, Leo, Leo for you,
and he hasn't even met this Leo guy.

17:54.166 --> 17:56.291
Right?

17:56.375 --> 17:59.083
But Ryan, he has all these questions
about his powers...

18:00.166 --> 18:02.959
the adoption, himself.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.458
Things that Leo knows
and I never really had to think about.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.375
(scoffs)

18:10.458 --> 18:12.792
Did you just trick me
into seeing Ryan's point of view?

18:12.875 --> 18:14.000
Did I?

18:17.709 --> 18:20.125
-(power whirs)
-All right!

18:20.208 --> 18:21.792
We got full power.

18:21.875 --> 18:25.709
And... thank you,
for helping me clear my head.

18:25.792 --> 18:27.542
Hey, that's what friends are for.

18:27.625 --> 18:29.125
-Ah, don't push it.
-Right.

18:32.709 --> 18:33.875
Hey, Leo.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.917
(groans)

18:39.583 --> 18:41.792
(Mastermind Waveform)
You knocked out my cameras,

18:41.875 --> 18:44.125
but I can tell someone's there.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.458
Who are you?

18:47.542 --> 18:49.875
(alarm blaring)

18:51.125 --> 18:54.291
The boss is flooding the station.
Evac! Now! Let's go!

19:03.750 --> 19:04.959
No!

19:07.291 --> 19:10.333
Leo! We got to go!

19:17.625 --> 19:19.625
(explosions)

19:25.250 --> 19:26.834
(Mark) No!

19:29.208 --> 19:30.458
(groans)

19:31.458 --> 19:32.375
(Mark) Ryan!

19:36.125 --> 19:39.792
Get Leo to Med Bay
and let's get Harris on the line.

19:39.875 --> 19:41.417
I got this.
You just take it easy.

19:42.875 --> 19:44.291
Are you okay?

19:44.375 --> 19:46.542
Yeah, I'm... I'm good.

19:46.625 --> 19:48.750
Mark, I'm really sorry about...

19:48.834 --> 19:51.041
about dragging us into this mess.

19:51.125 --> 19:52.834
(Mark)
Nah, bro, it... I get it.

19:52.917 --> 19:54.834
This is important to you.

19:54.917 --> 19:56.500
You need answers.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.875
And I got one.

19:58.959 --> 20:00.917
I know who the Mastermind is.

20:03.291 --> 20:04.875
Just got Leo
settled in the Medical Bay.

20:04.959 --> 20:06.417
That dude is seriously
messed up.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.083
And he keeps asking
for a grilled cheese.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.125
So, are you gonna tell us?

20:10.208 --> 20:13.291
-Spill, man. Come on!
-Who is the Mastermind?

20:14.375 --> 20:15.709
Okay.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.917
While I was in Leo's cell,
I figured something out.

20:22.166 --> 20:24.291
(Mastermind Waveform)
Who are you?

20:24.375 --> 20:27.083
(Ryan) I took out his camera,
but I could still tap into the feed.

20:27.166 --> 20:30.333
(Mastermind Waveform)
You must be a technopath.

20:30.417 --> 20:34.000
(Ryan) And I used my power
and I followed it back to the source.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.750
(sighs) I can't believe
what I'm saying.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.750
I can't believe that it's true.

20:38.834 --> 20:41.667
(Mastermind Waveform)
I guess I'll never know who you are.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.542
But it doesn't matter.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.458
'Cause you'll never
get out of here alive.

20:49.834 --> 20:52.000
(Ryan) I know who the guy
behind all of this is.

20:56.375 --> 20:57.834
It's Seth Harper.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.834
(beeping)

21:04.625 --> 21:06.500
Hey, guys.
Just finished up at Harper's.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.083
Geez, what's with the faces?

21:10.959 --> 21:13.125
What? Did something happen?

21:19.500 --> 21:20.917
(theme music playing)

21:43.834 --> 21:45.208
(barking)
