WEBVTT

00:03.984 --> 00:05.839
Previously on Heels...

00:05.839 --> 00:08.188
My dad built a coliseum
that was so goddamn expensive,

00:08.308 --> 00:09.209
that he buckled.

00:10.944 --> 00:12.812
The locker room's
for wrestlers, not valets.

00:12.912 --> 00:15.015
I'm not just a valet.
I can wrestle.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.585
Tale as old as time.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.587
Brothers sparring.
Cain and Abel.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.555
You beat Ace on his big night.

00:22.655 --> 00:24.024
You bought the props
to provoke him

00:24.124 --> 00:25.725
when he was trying
to win back the crowd.

00:25.825 --> 00:27.060
You humiliated me
in front of an entire town.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.595
Did you really plant
the Kleenex

00:28.695 --> 00:29.796
in the crowd that night?

00:29.896 --> 00:31.297
How dare you ask me
that question?

00:31.398 --> 00:32.532
Who do you know
who's been asked

00:32.632 --> 00:33.933
to sing the National Anthem

00:34.034 --> 00:35.468
at the Georgia State
Rodeo Championships?

00:35.568 --> 00:36.536
Hey!

00:36.636 --> 00:37.837
I'm so proud of you.

00:37.937 --> 00:39.472
Never thought
we'd be the kinda couple

00:39.572 --> 00:41.875
where someone had to leave home
in order to make a point.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.643
I'm not in our home right now

00:43.743 --> 00:44.911
because I am worried.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.246
If you don't fix
who you're becoming,

00:46.346 --> 00:47.247
you're gonna lose me.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.615
Talk to Ace.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.016
Make it worthy
of all this struggle.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.518
And then let's you and me
have a talk

00:51.618 --> 00:52.752
about what the future
looks like.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.295
Let's go! Throw 'em!

01:04.330 --> 01:05.532
Did you do this?

01:05.632 --> 01:06.966
Not this time.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.619
- They're fighting for real.
- No, I can see that.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.907
I can't break kayfabe.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.375
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:15.475 --> 01:16.743
Please don't do this.
I'm sorry.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.078
- Swear. Please.
- Hey, Ace!

01:25.018 --> 01:27.053
Fuck these guys.
I'm gonna go get that belt.

Hey.

03:41.354 --> 03:42.622
Move it!

03:42.722 --> 03:43.957
There's no room.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.226
Move your car now!

03:46.326 --> 03:48.161
Ace!

03:48.261 --> 03:49.529
Move your car!

03:49.629 --> 03:51.598
Buddy, you're runnin' hot.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.299
Good luck with this shit.

04:08.948 --> 04:11.517
DWL for life! Whoo!

04:11.618 --> 04:13.453
You saved the day, Crystal!

04:13.553 --> 04:15.655
Yeah! She saved the DWL!

04:15.755 --> 04:17.423
Oh, put her up!
Put her up! Come on!

04:17.523 --> 04:21.160
Crystal! Crystal!
Crystal! Crystal!

04:21.261 --> 04:25.098
Crystal! Crystal!
Crystal! Crystal!

04:25.198 --> 04:26.766
Hey, this is Staci.
Leave a message.

04:26.866 --> 04:28.334
I hope the rodeo went great.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.336
I'm so sorry
that I wasn't there.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.806
Um, send me
some video when you can.

04:33.906 --> 04:36.209
Love you. Bye.

04:36.309 --> 04:39.912
You have built
one hell of a family here.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.714
It ain't like the other places.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.683
Tonight was a triumph,
a real triumph.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.452
That was a time capsule event.

04:46.552 --> 04:47.820
Hey, Jackie boy.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.522
Your dad would have been
so proud of you.

04:49.622 --> 04:50.957
Thank you, Eddie.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.925
Thank you for being
there for us, always.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.227
Absolutely.

04:54.327 --> 04:56.129
Jack, my, oh, my,
did you deliver.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.997
That's the loudest
this arena's ever been.

04:58.097 --> 04:59.666
I'm ready to close the deal
on next year's fair

04:59.666 --> 05:00.933
and the next one,

05:01.034 --> 05:02.101
and let's throw
in a third year too.

05:02.201 --> 05:03.469
You just tell me
when and where.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.371
Now's as good a time as any.
Hey, Willie?

05:05.471 --> 05:07.173
Oh, you must introduce me
to Wild Bill.

05:07.273 --> 05:09.042
Ah, it'd be my pleasure.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.176
Just give me a minute.

05:10.276 --> 05:11.658
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

05:11.758 --> 05:13.913
Let's camp out,
wait for Wild Bill,

05:13.913 --> 05:15.581
jump that fake-ass cowboy.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.116
Oh, I'll curb-stomp that dude.

05:17.216 --> 05:19.018
All right, check your
TRT levels, boys.

05:19.118 --> 05:21.968
After that finish,
we can't fuck the DWL

05:22.088 --> 05:23.489
worse than they just fucked themselves.

05:23.589 --> 05:26.726
That was the dumbest finish
I ever saw, okay?

05:26.826 --> 05:29.062
And Jack Spade,
rasslin' purist,

05:29.162 --> 05:31.864
he is now deeply,
irredeemably fuckin' fucked

05:31.964 --> 05:33.733
in a way he can't unfuck
his way out of.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.768
He can shoot a vignette
justifying it.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.537
Not if I cut a promo
ragging on it first.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.238
Get a phone out.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.574
Kevin, fuck your Android with
your green text bubbles, okay?

05:41.674 --> 05:44.610
Paul, say when.

05:44.711 --> 05:45.712
Action.

05:45.812 --> 05:47.180
Attention, Dystopian Disciples!

05:47.280 --> 05:48.648
Charlie Gully out here

05:48.748 --> 05:50.516
at the South Georgia
State Fair.

05:50.616 --> 05:52.018
In case you missed it,

05:52.118 --> 05:55.788
your new DWL Champion is...

05:55.888 --> 05:57.337
the valet!

05:57.457 --> 05:59.892
That's right,
the fucking valet!

05:59.992 --> 06:03.029
Bunny Bombshell,
who hip-hoppity-hopped

06:03.129 --> 06:06.999
around the ring
twitching her cottontail ass

06:07.100 --> 06:08.267
till she got the belt.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.136
According
to Jack Spade's logic,

06:10.236 --> 06:13.005
I guess anybody can just grab
the belt.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.608
The match is apparently
wide open

06:15.708 --> 06:17.944
to anybody or any animal

06:18.044 --> 06:19.245
in the free world.

06:19.345 --> 06:22.215
So if you desire the DWL belt,

06:22.315 --> 06:25.151
get yourself some bunny ears
or a pig snout

06:25.251 --> 06:27.066
or a braid of horse-ass hair,

06:27.186 --> 06:29.155
and abra-fucking-cadabra!

06:29.255 --> 06:31.524
The DWL belt can be yours.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.342
- Cut.
- Post that!

06:36.462 --> 06:39.499
That fuckin' conceited fuck
Jack Spade

06:39.599 --> 06:43.536
is gonna wish
he never fucked with me.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.905
Hope the ink
don't stain your bra.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.907
Thank you.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.642
Well, Shakespeare,

06:49.742 --> 06:52.078
wasn't the way you scripted,
but it popped.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.980
I saw you two idiots
hammering away,

06:54.080 --> 06:55.314
and I thought it was over,

06:55.415 --> 06:56.883
but we pulled a rabbit
out of a hat.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.151
Bunny Bombshell.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.786
You see her rip off the ears?

06:59.886 --> 07:01.854
Hell of a piece of business.
So good.

07:01.954 --> 07:02.889
I called that.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.424
She called that.

07:04.524 --> 07:06.292
Look, I'm the one who stood up
and saved her ass

07:06.392 --> 07:09.028
so she could save your ass
while my ass was leaking.

07:09.128 --> 07:10.730
I'm sure that video of my shame

07:10.830 --> 07:11.931
will soon be trending
on Reddit.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.132
Mm-hmm.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.400
Have you seen Ace?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.968
Nah, I was showering,
which required

07:16.068 --> 07:18.671
my full concentration
and a lotta soap.

07:20.072 --> 07:22.642
You and Ace tore
the house down.

07:22.742 --> 07:25.211
You're top guys.

07:25.311 --> 07:26.746
This Cain-Abel thing
will take you

07:26.846 --> 07:27.980
to the promised land,

07:28.080 --> 07:30.216
if you both can
keep it together.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.151
I know a thing when I see it.

07:32.251 --> 07:33.820
Oh, Jack, there you are.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.054
Hey, Constance.

07:35.154 --> 07:36.956
Bill, this is Constance.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.858
She booked us for the fair.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.927
You are a wise woman, Constance.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.995
Well, we just loved it.

07:43.095 --> 07:44.697
My favorite part was
the special effects

07:44.797 --> 07:45.765
with the pants.

07:45.865 --> 07:47.133
I was concerned at first.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.001
Connie, there's not
a single part of my body

07:49.101 --> 07:50.603
I can't control.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.239
- Hey, Debbie?
- Yeah?

07:53.339 --> 07:55.942
- Have you seen Ace?
- Uh, nope.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.711
Uh, excuse me.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.179
Mm.

08:09.021 --> 08:10.823
Yeah!

08:21.601 --> 08:23.102
Ace!

08:35.014 --> 08:36.649
Ace.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.519
Ace!

08:52.465 --> 08:53.699
Hey.

11:13.973 --> 11:17.543
Staci, please tell Jack
to make this all go faster.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.427
Thank you.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.563
Thank you for coming.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.432
Thank you so much...

11:40.533 --> 11:43.235
Thank you.

11:43.335 --> 11:44.637
Thank you.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.112
Maybe Tom had that, uh,
concussion syndrome, CTE.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.380
Saw the end.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.215
He still seemed
pretty sharp to me.

11:56.315 --> 11:57.783
Plus, if he knew he had CTE,

11:57.883 --> 11:59.285
he would have shot himself
in the chest

11:59.385 --> 12:01.120
so science could study
his brain.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.555
Not everybody
that kills himself

12:02.655 --> 12:04.123
is thinking ahead like that.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.491
Especially if they got CTE.

12:05.591 --> 12:06.759
It's gotta be money.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.260
It's always money.

12:08.360 --> 12:12.364
Tom thought Ace was
a first-round NFL pick.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.300
That right there is proof
he had CTE.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.569
Nah, I-I was an all-state
tight end because of Ace.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.271
Ace was good, really good.

12:19.371 --> 12:20.840
Football dream fell short,
but that don't mean

12:20.940 --> 12:23.042
Tom's belief in Ace
going all the way was unearned.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.577
Amen.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.645
Some people just get hit
with anguish out of nowhere,

12:26.746 --> 12:29.615
and they don't know
how to hit back at it.

12:29.715 --> 12:31.817
Also seemed like the kinda
wrestling he had us doing

12:31.917 --> 12:34.253
just no longer brought in
the fans.

12:34.353 --> 12:35.888
He still had a lot
to live for, man.

12:35.988 --> 12:37.323
Or not.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.525
Your reality inside
and outside your head

12:39.625 --> 12:41.827
doesn't always line up.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.329
Look, I'm just sayin'.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.697
It's not our place to judge.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.232
That's never stopped us before.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.747
Not at all, baby.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.402
So just make the rounds.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.971
Pick up trash,
check the Sterno cans

12:52.071 --> 12:53.639
for the heating trays,
and keep the coolers stocked.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.307
- Thank you.
- Uh, oh, no, no, no.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.076
We, uh--we just wanna help
the family.

12:57.176 --> 12:58.310
We can't take any money.

12:58.410 --> 12:59.745
Why?

12:59.845 --> 13:01.747
You some fancy new order
of nuns or something?

13:01.847 --> 13:03.616
You think
first responders work for free?

13:03.716 --> 13:05.251
I'm not sure
how first responders--

13:05.351 --> 13:07.286
First responders get paid.
So do soldiers.

13:07.386 --> 13:08.487
Cancer doctors have
ocean-view mansions.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.156
Why? They got paid.

13:10.256 --> 13:11.290
Someone offers you money
for your work,

13:11.390 --> 13:12.725
stick your hand out.

13:17.563 --> 13:20.366
Tom just had that thing,
didn't he?

13:20.466 --> 13:23.302
That-that man thing,
that handsome twinkle

13:23.402 --> 13:24.537
that makes a woman quiver.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.906
The kinda thing
that makes a woman

13:27.006 --> 13:30.442
sit up and say, "That is
a handsome, handsome man.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.778
Tall drink of water."

13:36.749 --> 13:39.051
- Uh--
- Thank you.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.453
Uh--thanks. Oh.

13:46.025 --> 13:48.027
Oh, I am so sorry.

13:48.127 --> 13:51.664
No, that's, uh--that's on me.

13:51.764 --> 13:52.698
Thanks.

13:52.798 --> 13:53.999
Yeah.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.960
Carol.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.484
I'm sorry to miss the funeral.

14:12.585 --> 14:16.455
I was--don't matter.

14:21.627 --> 14:24.763
Bill, your old friend is buried
in Duffy Cemetery.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.166
Go top off the gravesite
with a couple shovelfuls

14:27.266 --> 14:31.370
if you're feeling mournful,
but I do not want you here,

14:31.470 --> 14:33.873
walking around,
sucking up the spotlight.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.457
Can I help pay for anything?

14:38.577 --> 14:40.145
Nothing left to pay for.

14:40.246 --> 14:42.548
This place is shuttin' down.

14:42.648 --> 14:43.983
It's a shame

14:44.083 --> 14:46.819
you and Tom
never really repaired things.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.921
Not surprising
considering your success

14:49.021 --> 14:50.356
and his lack of it.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.792
Your achievements cast
quite the shadow.

14:57.162 --> 14:59.698
It's how things go,

14:59.798 --> 15:01.166
or went.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.572
How much cash you got on you?

15:09.341 --> 15:13.212
I think I got, uh, well...

15:13.312 --> 15:14.280
Thank you.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.215
I'll put it to good use.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.790
Forgot.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.664
Got these too.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.466
It's a bit wet, but...

15:34.566 --> 15:36.568
sweat don't make 'em
counterfeit.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.006
Yes. Thank you.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.775
- I'll see you.
- See you.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.524
Staci, Barbara Holt.
We haven't been introduced.

15:45.644 --> 15:46.845
I work at Town Hall.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.681
So sorry about King Spade.

15:48.781 --> 15:49.982
We sure appreciate

15:50.082 --> 15:51.784
everyone coming out here
today, Barbara.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.786
Duffy comes together
when Duffy people need it.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.889
It's what makes Duffy Duffy.
Duffy Strong, you know?

15:56.989 --> 15:58.757
Even though
you're not from here,

15:58.857 --> 16:02.194
Duffy's adopted you,
Jack's wife, as one of us.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.664
My friend Mimi Brainard
works over at Sanctity Health.

16:05.764 --> 16:10.135
She intimated you recently had
your D over there.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.470
Miscarriages stink.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.305
I've been there twice.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.707
If you ever need to talk or--

16:14.807 --> 16:16.141
Barbara, please tell
Mimi Branner,

16:16.241 --> 16:17.242
who I do not know--

16:17.343 --> 16:18.844
Brainard, with a D on the end.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.479
Tell Mimi with a D on the end

16:20.579 --> 16:22.081
if something unthinkable
happens to her

16:22.181 --> 16:23.682
and I hear about it,
I'll still keep it to myself.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.050
- I just--she--
- What I actually want you

16:25.150 --> 16:26.318
to tell her
is to shut her fat mouth

16:26.418 --> 16:27.619
before I shut it for her,

16:27.720 --> 16:29.555
but that's not very ladylike,
is it?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.023
Thanks again
for being here today.

16:31.123 --> 16:32.758
Duffy really showed up
for the Spade family.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.193
We so appreciate it.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.231
Fuckin' Duffy Strong fake-ass--

16:39.331 --> 16:42.067
mind your own fuckin' business
before I D your fuckin' ass

16:42.167 --> 16:43.248
right through
the fuckin' floor.

16:43.369 --> 16:44.770
Stace?

16:44.870 --> 16:46.171
Everything all right?

16:46.271 --> 16:48.207
Oh, my God, Ace, I'm sorry.

16:48.307 --> 16:49.675
You didn't do nothin' to me.

16:49.775 --> 16:50.609
Sounds like someone's
'bout to have somethin'

16:50.709 --> 16:52.077
done to them, though.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.580
- I was just gonna--
- D someone's fuckin' ass

16:54.680 --> 16:55.681
right through
the fuckin' floor,

16:55.781 --> 16:56.715
which no idea what that means,

16:56.815 --> 16:59.451
but sounds painful.

16:59.551 --> 17:02.321
Took a walk
so I didn't... do that.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.256
Need me to do it?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.091
Don't tell me it's Jack.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.227
No, tell me it's Jack.

17:08.327 --> 17:09.395
No.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.030
Jack and I don't fight.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.831
Yeah, I know,

17:12.931 --> 17:14.366
which I don't understand
how that's possible.

17:14.466 --> 17:16.335
He's so... Jack.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.638
We want the same things.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.540
Not one fight?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.543
He never got drunk
at a college frat party?

17:24.643 --> 17:26.378
We both got drunk in college.

17:26.478 --> 17:30.449
But fought-fought,

17:30.549 --> 17:31.617
no.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.018
I'll say it again.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.487
None of us know how Jack
landed a saint like you.

17:35.587 --> 17:37.790
I'm not a saint.
We both got lucky.

17:41.493 --> 17:43.762
How are you?

17:43.862 --> 17:45.230
You doing all right?

17:47.666 --> 17:49.935
Your dad loved you very much.

17:51.336 --> 17:53.072
Broke his damn heart.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.340
I don't think that's true.

17:55.441 --> 17:56.775
Facts.

17:59.044 --> 18:00.979
He coached me my whole life.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.817
Every sport.
Every single sport.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.786
Worked with me. Encouraged me.

18:07.886 --> 18:10.722
He invested so much in me.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.825
Got me a college
football scholarship.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.426
You got your scholarship.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.695
Not without his devotion.

18:16.795 --> 18:18.730
He taught me how to work hard.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.566
Made me work hard.

18:20.666 --> 18:23.435
Set goals, achieve 'em.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.704
And I fucked that up.

18:25.804 --> 18:28.841
Couldn't carry it through.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.778
And that was, uh...

18:32.878 --> 18:34.813
I was an investment
that didn't pay off.

18:34.913 --> 18:36.915
He adored you.

18:38.650 --> 18:41.453
I think he felt this duty

18:41.553 --> 18:44.323
to be Tom Spade, King of Duffy.

18:44.423 --> 18:47.359
And he didn't feel like
he was that anymore.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.696
Duffy loved my dad.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.664
Jack only moved y'all here
a couple of years ago,

18:52.764 --> 18:56.768
so you never saw
what the DWL meant here, but...

18:56.869 --> 19:00.205
when I was little,
when it was good...

19:00.305 --> 19:04.209
ugh, unreal.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.811
So loud.

19:05.911 --> 19:08.113
So devoted.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.315
When we'd go downtown,
my dad was a celebrity.

19:10.415 --> 19:11.817
Get free ice cream.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.052
The firemen would let me
slide down the fire pole.

19:16.188 --> 19:19.391
You'd think that would've
been enough for him.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.226
Everyone just glad to see you.

19:23.929 --> 19:26.665
Think he thought
I was better than I was.

19:26.765 --> 19:29.701
Made me think
I was better than I was.

19:29.801 --> 19:32.004
And I was good,
but wasn't going pro.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.239
Shit, I couldn't even go D1.

19:37.109 --> 19:40.078
Wish he let me wrestle.

19:40.078 --> 19:42.414
Think he was afraid
I'd like it.

19:42.514 --> 19:46.418
Didn't want me to think
it'd be a... path.

19:48.487 --> 19:52.357
Maybe you could think of it
as an act of love,

19:52.457 --> 19:54.626
steering you away from it.

19:54.726 --> 19:57.029
It hurt him.
He didn't want you hurt.

19:58.664 --> 20:01.533
If that's the case, he probably
shouldn't have killed himself.

20:14.993 --> 20:17.716
Now, don't overdo it, dear.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.885
Rubbin' this floor
just makes it dirtier.

20:19.985 --> 20:23.622
This place is about to get
knocked down or repurposed.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.823
What?

20:24.923 --> 20:26.792
The--the DWL can't close down.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.093
There's so much more
to be done--

20:28.193 --> 20:31.697
One-horse town
just lost its horse.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.399
King Spade made sure of that.

20:45.444 --> 20:46.678
Huh.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.013
Why don't you hand 'em
to me one by one?

20:48.113 --> 20:49.414
If I aim right,
I can hit the dumpster.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.417
Tom thought
when we hit the big time,

20:52.517 --> 20:54.653
that those old title belts
would be collector's items.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.088
Yeah, he thought
a lotta things.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.756
Just want one of these
for Thomas' bedroom.

20:57.856 --> 20:59.658
Right, well, I'm sure
whoever turns this place

20:59.758 --> 21:01.373
into a microbrewery
won't want 'em.

21:01.493 --> 21:03.829
Hey, maybe we should turn
this place into a microbrewery.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.898
Should get as far away
from this place as we can.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.077
What?

21:26.718 --> 21:28.120
Did you read this?

21:28.220 --> 21:30.389
I just fuckin'
found it two seconds ago.

21:39.097 --> 21:41.600
Well, none of these say
Willie on 'em, do they?

21:44.736 --> 21:46.438
You all right?

21:46.538 --> 21:48.307
Yeah, I'm good.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.495
Thank you for helping to keep
this dream alive with him.

22:10.595 --> 22:12.264
Kept it alive
till it killed him.

22:12.364 --> 22:13.632
He killed him.

22:13.732 --> 22:14.700
No, I could've--

22:14.800 --> 22:16.935
I could've told him to get out,

22:17.035 --> 22:19.671
drop it, end it.

22:19.771 --> 22:21.773
I didn't.

22:21.873 --> 22:25.243
He spent decades of his life
investing everything he had,

22:25.243 --> 22:28.080
so much that the idea
of folding it down

22:28.180 --> 22:31.783
was some declaration of failure

22:31.883 --> 22:33.318
that he couldn't bear.

22:33.318 --> 22:35.821
He bought a house.
Fed his family.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.556
Didn't do much
other than wrestle

22:37.656 --> 22:39.391
for most of his adult life.

22:39.491 --> 22:43.462
That not being
enough of a life for him,

22:43.562 --> 22:45.464
that's his declaration.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.302
He's a pussy. He's a coward.

22:50.402 --> 22:51.870
And he took
the coward's way out.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.405
Fuck you.

22:53.505 --> 22:54.973
Fine. Fuck me.

22:55.073 --> 22:57.175
Fuck him too.

22:57.275 --> 22:58.777
He hid so much from y'all,

22:58.877 --> 23:00.445
all the pressure,
the weight he carried.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.647
He threw his weight around
every chance he got.

23:02.748 --> 23:05.450
Open the letter.

23:05.550 --> 23:06.718
Please.

23:06.818 --> 23:08.720
I don't care what he wrote.

23:20.345 --> 23:22.401
I'm sorry I said fuck you.

23:22.501 --> 23:24.369
I shouldn't have said fuck you.

23:27.272 --> 23:29.274
Jacket's yours if you want it.

23:29.374 --> 23:31.022
Well, it's a stupid jacket.

23:32.978 --> 23:36.214
Jack, Willie, we headin' out.

23:37.516 --> 23:39.217
Gentlemen, thank you
for all that y'all did

23:39.317 --> 23:41.286
to make this place this place

23:41.386 --> 23:43.288
and, uh, for-for being here today

23:43.388 --> 23:46.158
to--to help with the grieving.

23:47.292 --> 23:49.327
I don't know how to say this,
man, but, uh,

23:49.428 --> 23:52.063
there's no Duffy
without the DWL.

23:52.164 --> 23:55.667
I understand it,
but it sucks that it's over.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.169
It's a blessing.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.970
More people were here
for this funeral feast

23:59.070 --> 24:00.839
than the last three shows combined.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.241
True. Free food is undefeated.

24:03.341 --> 24:05.110
We should have had free food
at the matches.

24:06.878 --> 24:10.715
Hey, Jack,
we were sayin' that, uh,

24:10.816 --> 24:13.251
Tom deserved a ten-bell salute.

24:13.351 --> 24:16.121
I mean, it's--
it's the honorable thing to do.

24:17.389 --> 24:20.125
Man, Tom Spade was all about
hittin' his finisher.

24:20.225 --> 24:22.294
He already went out
with a bang.

24:25.096 --> 24:27.399
Here, you want a keepsake?

24:28.867 --> 24:30.235
Help yourself.

24:34.072 --> 24:35.574
We could've been
on the comeback trail

24:35.674 --> 24:36.808
with the DWL.

24:36.908 --> 24:39.177
So many ideas to build it back,

24:39.277 --> 24:42.647
and I had great angles
for booking

24:42.747 --> 24:45.951
and matches and characters.

24:46.051 --> 24:47.466
You did. I know you did.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.921
All he had to do was take
a little bit of my input.

24:50.021 --> 24:52.123
But no thank you.

24:52.224 --> 24:55.393
He'd rather kill himself.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.095
I'm having a difficult time

24:57.195 --> 24:59.631
not takin' that personally.

24:59.731 --> 25:01.500
I'm sorry, Jack.

25:05.136 --> 25:06.404
Couple of the boys
thought we should do

25:06.505 --> 25:08.707
a ten-bell salute for him.

25:10.675 --> 25:14.312
In my head, I'm like,
"Salutin' what?"

25:16.381 --> 25:18.517
Salutin' him tappin' out
when things got rough?

25:18.617 --> 25:19.851
Fuck no.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.389
Today was his no-bell salute.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.761
Funeral for a man

25:29.861 --> 25:32.163
and an entire business.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.802
Maybe what the guys--

25:42.274 --> 25:44.342
Say whatever you gonna say.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.711
No, I don't wanna
complicate it.

25:46.811 --> 25:49.414
Staci, I'm real foggy.

25:49.514 --> 25:51.783
Just say
what you were gonna say.

25:55.020 --> 25:58.189
Well, maybe you can...

25:58.290 --> 26:01.693
I don't know,
host one final event,

26:01.793 --> 26:05.997
in the spirit
of, like, a memorial match.

26:06.097 --> 26:09.434
The ten-bell salute would be
just part of it for his memory,

26:09.534 --> 26:13.872
but then the event is for you,

26:13.972 --> 26:17.342
Willie, the guys,

26:17.442 --> 26:19.277
so y'all can close down the DWL

26:19.377 --> 26:23.014
with a celebration
of what you all built

26:23.114 --> 26:26.217
and what he built

26:26.318 --> 26:29.487
and what you all loved, wrestling.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.096
No, that'd be too sad.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.564
You know, people...

26:39.664 --> 26:42.047
...they come to our show
to escape their own lives,

26:42.167 --> 26:43.848
not to get weighed down
by ours.

26:43.969 --> 26:47.973
People cared about your family
and this promotion.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.107
And the joy it brought 'em.

26:49.207 --> 26:50.342
Even if interest waned,

26:50.442 --> 26:52.477
it still means something deep.

26:53.912 --> 26:57.549
Write something
for the DWL extended family.

26:57.649 --> 27:01.786
One final show for everyone.

27:01.886 --> 27:04.222
For you most of all.

27:08.393 --> 27:10.428
I don't know.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.634
I'm gonna miss it.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.886
Take some of this when you go.

27:34.886 --> 27:38.156
Every hour, more food arrives.

27:38.256 --> 27:39.858
Folks seem to think
a suicide calls

27:39.958 --> 27:41.459
for me inhaling a carrot cake.

27:41.559 --> 27:43.528
Folks are just trying to help.

27:43.628 --> 27:46.131
I'm not feeding
a damn firehouse.

27:46.231 --> 27:47.766
Ace can eat pretty good.

27:47.866 --> 27:49.234
Ace isn't eating at all.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.603
Ace is--

27:51.703 --> 27:53.571
I'm worried about Ace
most of all.

27:58.109 --> 27:59.344
Mom, I'm thinking of hosting

27:59.444 --> 28:02.614
kind of a celebration of life
for Dad.

28:02.714 --> 28:05.517
One last event at the Dome
before we shut it all down.

28:05.617 --> 28:09.888
Something honorable,
but also... festive.

28:09.988 --> 28:13.058
I don't consider his suicide
festive or celebratory.

28:13.158 --> 28:14.459
Ah, I shouldn't
have said festive.

28:14.559 --> 28:15.994
No, you shouldn't have.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.731
Yesterday was awful.

28:19.831 --> 28:23.735
All that pity.
All of Duffy staring at me.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.437
Pity gives off
a distinctive stench.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.205
I don't like being the one
giving off that stench.

28:27.305 --> 28:29.207
So feel free
to festively tie a bow

28:29.307 --> 28:30.842
around this lousy present
your dad left us,

28:30.942 --> 28:32.043
but count me out.

28:32.143 --> 28:33.545
You don't mean all that.

28:33.645 --> 28:36.448
Your dad was a grown man
who loved playing pretend.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.029
It was fun when it was fun,

28:38.149 --> 28:39.651
but when he got it in his head

28:39.751 --> 28:42.454
that playing pretend could
make us rich and it didn't,

28:42.554 --> 28:45.223
well, you see
where that left us.

28:45.323 --> 28:47.859
And it's a stupid thing...

28:47.959 --> 28:50.462
a stupid, stupid thing
to give your life to,

28:50.562 --> 28:53.331
and then to take
your life beca--

28:55.066 --> 28:57.502
I don't wanna talk about it.

28:57.602 --> 28:59.904
When they turn the lights off
at that dump,

29:00.004 --> 29:02.841
all I'll say is,
"Bring on the wrecking ball."

29:07.112 --> 29:08.446
Hey.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.050
Hey.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.896
Hey, everybody.

29:24.996 --> 29:28.366
So, uh, I know that I'm
just the son of the boss,

29:28.466 --> 29:31.035
or I-I was, or is.

29:31.136 --> 29:34.339
Eh--

29:34.439 --> 29:35.740
I've been thinkin'
about how this is

29:35.840 --> 29:37.742
the end of the road
for this promotion.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.744
And I heard what y'all said
the other day, and I agree.

29:39.844 --> 29:42.347
This occasion
deserves to be marked.

29:42.447 --> 29:45.150
I wanna do my dad right
with a ten-bell salute,

29:45.250 --> 29:48.586
then do us right
with one last card.

29:48.686 --> 29:51.689
I wanna walk outta this place
with our heads held high.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.159
We'll give away tickets.
Free beer.

29:54.259 --> 29:56.394
People can take home
the folding chair

29:56.494 --> 29:57.996
and smash each other
over the head with 'em

29:58.096 --> 29:59.864
for all I care.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.299
Who's in?

30:01.399 --> 30:02.734
- Shit, I'm in.
- Rooster's in, baby.

30:04.435 --> 30:05.670
Okay, boys.

30:05.770 --> 30:07.238
Jack has written a script.

30:07.338 --> 30:08.840
Script--what the hell you mean,
a script?

30:08.940 --> 30:10.542
Y'all don't forget
we're recyclin',

30:10.642 --> 30:11.910
so I need these back.

30:12.010 --> 30:15.346
Rooster, when I was
weighing doing this,

30:15.446 --> 30:16.881
I wrote a few things down.

30:16.981 --> 30:19.884
Just have ideas
how things could go.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.085
This is awesome.

30:21.186 --> 30:23.321
Tom used to just
let us wing it.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.490
"Hey, hey, hey, Rooster,
with a clothesline,

30:25.590 --> 30:26.858
"and then-then something else,

30:26.958 --> 30:28.693
and then move so--
to something else."

30:28.793 --> 30:30.361
"Something else.
Something else."

30:30.461 --> 30:31.729
"Yeah, yeah,
then you go over--

30:31.830 --> 30:33.331
then you go--figure it out.
Figure--"

30:33.431 --> 30:34.933
Wait, wait.

30:35.033 --> 30:36.267
Dumpsters and tables?

30:36.367 --> 30:38.002
Let's go, baby!

30:38.102 --> 30:39.204
Hey, Jack.

30:39.304 --> 30:41.472
Um, can we talk for a sec?

30:43.007 --> 30:44.509
I'm lovin' all of this.

30:45.810 --> 30:47.212
This is not
what Dad would have wanted--

30:47.312 --> 30:48.913
Wanted, I know.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.415
But you did, Jack.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.284
You did want me
to be a part of the DWL.

30:53.384 --> 30:56.287
And you know what?
Deep down, I did too.

30:56.387 --> 30:58.523
And if you're gonna have one
last go-around with this place,

30:58.623 --> 31:00.758
I want my first go-around.

31:00.859 --> 31:01.759
I want in.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.361
It's not as easy as it looks.

31:03.461 --> 31:04.896
Oh, come on, you do it.

31:04.996 --> 31:06.431
I mean, you're a good athlete,
but come on,

31:06.431 --> 31:08.333
I'm a phenomenal athlete.

31:08.433 --> 31:09.701
Plus, I found him first.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.035
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

31:11.135 --> 31:12.737
It means I need
a different final memory

31:12.837 --> 31:14.873
than being woken up
by a gunshot!

31:17.041 --> 31:18.643
I need this, Jack.

31:18.743 --> 31:20.645
I can't let y'all
shut this place down

31:20.745 --> 31:22.146
doin' the one thing
Dad wouldn't let me do

31:22.247 --> 31:25.216
because he thought
I was gonna be this big star

31:25.316 --> 31:27.619
that I didn't turn out to be.

31:30.488 --> 31:32.357
You know what, so what?

31:32.457 --> 31:34.726
But then again, not "So what?"

31:34.826 --> 31:37.195
It's, like, fucking--

31:37.295 --> 31:40.164
I cannot
sit on the bench watching.

31:40.265 --> 31:41.733
Let me play.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.501
Write me three or four moves.
I'll pick it up.

31:43.601 --> 31:46.437
It's in my blood,
just like yours.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.406
And come on, taking a bump?

31:48.506 --> 31:49.774
I played football for years.

31:49.874 --> 31:52.110
Quarterbacks get to slide.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.245
I can handle it.

32:00.051 --> 32:02.020
- Okay, nice and easy.
- Yeah.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.955
It's like a walkthrough
before a football game.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.723
Yeah, except football
is man against man.

32:05.723 --> 32:09.427
This is all about cooperation,
workin' together.

32:09.527 --> 32:11.696
Ace used to be a kid,
and then boom,

32:11.796 --> 32:13.431
there he is now, a man.

32:13.531 --> 32:15.099
Very fit, don't you think?

32:15.199 --> 32:17.568
Handsome guy. Fit.

32:19.237 --> 32:20.872
Well, fit don't mean shit.

32:20.972 --> 32:23.541
Girls always want guys to admit
other guys are handsome.

32:23.641 --> 32:24.776
What's that about?

32:24.876 --> 32:26.544
I'm just saying
he's fit, is all.

32:26.644 --> 32:28.313
He greener
than Kermit the Frog.

32:28.413 --> 32:29.881
He can't pick up this shit
in a week.

32:29.981 --> 32:31.683
- There it is!
- Look, I'll tell you what.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.264
We gon' go out with our heads
hanging low in shame.

32:33.384 --> 32:34.953
- Watch.
- Roo, it's Tom's son.

32:35.053 --> 32:36.487
Wha--don't mean he can wrestle.

32:36.587 --> 32:37.855
Ace is the best athlete I know.

32:37.956 --> 32:38.990
Mm-hmm.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.491
You--you actin' like
you don't know me.

32:40.591 --> 32:41.526
Ace was Jim's best man
at his wedding.

32:41.526 --> 32:43.227
That's why he's saying it.

32:43.328 --> 32:45.363
Ace never wrestled 'cause Tom
didn't want him distracted,

32:45.463 --> 32:47.432
not because he wouldn't have
been as good as any of us.

32:47.532 --> 32:48.733
He would have been.

32:48.833 --> 32:50.335
I'm not saying should've been, but...

32:50.435 --> 32:51.616
- Do it again!
- ...would've.

32:51.736 --> 32:53.738
Okay, well, I'ma go see
if you a liar.

32:53.838 --> 32:56.207
- Uh--oh.
- Go, go, go!

32:56.307 --> 32:57.642
Your right side,
not on your left side.

32:57.742 --> 33:00.578
Hey, Jack,
let me stand in for you.

33:00.678 --> 33:01.980
Hey, have at it.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.147
All right.

33:04.449 --> 33:06.584
We gon' walk through
the match here.

33:06.684 --> 33:08.453
Little bit of this,
little bit of that, all right?

33:08.553 --> 33:09.787
Lock up.

33:09.887 --> 33:11.089
Sitting in the ring, baby.

33:11.189 --> 33:13.057
Come on. Here we go.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.926
- Oh, oka--no, no. Put your--
- Sorry.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.561
Put your--good.
Put your hand behind my head.

33:16.561 --> 33:18.663
- A'ight, now, use your legs.
- Yeah.

33:18.763 --> 33:20.698
- That's leverage.
- Rooster, well done.

33:20.798 --> 33:23.534
Ace, then I'm gonna
overpower you into a headlock.

33:25.503 --> 33:26.938
Make sure you sell it.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.573
Any time the hold tightens,
that's your signal.

33:28.673 --> 33:29.974
The more you make it
look like it hurts,

33:30.074 --> 33:31.409
the better you look
when you go over.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.643
Actually,
that's a little tight.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.846
Good!
Now, Ace,

33:34.946 --> 33:37.115
you gon' clear some space
with your right elbow.

33:37.215 --> 33:38.683
You're gonna whip Rooster
into the ropes,

33:38.783 --> 33:40.351
go for the clothesline,
but he's gon' duck it.

33:41.919 --> 33:43.287
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:43.388 --> 33:45.790
I'm talking very, very,
very, very, very slow motion

33:45.890 --> 33:47.191
on the clothesline.

33:48.826 --> 33:49.727
- Okay?
- Yeah.

33:49.827 --> 33:51.362
- Slow.
- Yeah.

33:51.462 --> 33:54.565
On the day, I'm gon' take
a back body drop, all right?

33:54.665 --> 33:56.801
Then we gon' square off,
center of the ring,

33:56.901 --> 33:58.069
brother versus brother.

33:58.169 --> 33:59.771
- Gotta let 'em feel it!
- All right.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.272
- Again!
- Come on. Ready?

34:01.372 --> 34:02.340
Okay, here we go.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.408
Go!

34:06.210 --> 34:07.779
There it is.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.047
- Clear with your elbow!
- Your elbow. Your elbow.

34:10.314 --> 34:11.516
- Slow down!
- There it is.

34:11.616 --> 34:13.851
Ah, slow--

34:13.951 --> 34:15.586
- Oh!
- There we go, little brother!

34:15.686 --> 34:17.422
That's some creatine
working right there, baby!

34:17.522 --> 34:19.023
- All right, Ace.
- Okay.

34:19.123 --> 34:21.826
- That's it.
- Let me at him.

34:21.926 --> 34:25.229
♪ Well, it's spilling
Out red gutter pipes ♪

34:25.329 --> 34:28.966
♪ To cooling brothers

34:28.966 --> 34:33.237

34:54.926 --> 34:56.727
Enough with the 101.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.409
Let me leap off
the top turnbuckle.

34:58.529 --> 35:00.765
No. No. Not necessary.

35:00.865 --> 35:02.533
Come on, man.
Rooster, help me out, dude.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.035
Do not help him out!

35:04.135 --> 35:06.237
Ace, look, you gotta know
what you're doin' there

35:06.337 --> 35:09.874
because if you get up there,
it can go real bad real quick.

35:09.974 --> 35:11.876
You're gon' fall.
You're gon' kill yourself.

35:11.976 --> 35:14.145
Mom's gonna find out.
She's gonna kill me.

35:14.245 --> 35:15.780
We're gonna have
dead Spade men everywhere.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.381
It'll be an incredible finish.

35:17.482 --> 35:18.816
It's bad enough
that I'm putting you over.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.351
High spots are risky.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.687
If you miss the mark,
you knee me in the nuts,

35:22.787 --> 35:24.155
I'm done having kids.

35:24.255 --> 35:25.857
- I can do it!
- Let me get in there.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.225
Don't worry about me.

35:27.325 --> 35:28.926
Sometimes a kid's
gotta touch the fire.

35:29.026 --> 35:31.729
- Okay.
- Come on.

35:31.829 --> 35:33.044
On three.

35:33.164 --> 35:35.299
One, two, three.

35:39.604 --> 35:40.671
It ain't that easy, baby.

35:40.671 --> 35:42.306
Didn't quite nail the distance.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.480
- Hey, Roo.
- What's up?

35:49.580 --> 35:50.581
Where you heading after this?

35:50.681 --> 35:52.383
Oh, probably Chick-fil-A.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.751
To wrestle, man, not eat.

35:53.851 --> 35:55.019
Oh, no clue.

35:55.119 --> 35:56.454
But I'ma land on my feet
like a cat.

35:56.454 --> 35:58.122
- Man.
- You?

35:58.222 --> 36:00.525
Not sure.
I'm bad at transitions.

36:00.625 --> 36:01.739
Oh, man.
You'll be good, my man.

36:01.859 --> 36:03.661
Have faith.

36:03.761 --> 36:06.664
So, just like Jack
scripted it, all right?

36:06.764 --> 36:08.266
I get my shine up front.

36:08.366 --> 36:10.081
You go for your comeback.
I'll shut it down.

36:10.201 --> 36:11.802
All right, now,
you take me outside,

36:11.903 --> 36:12.937
and you motherfuck me
with that chair.

36:13.037 --> 36:14.519
Ga-ging! Ga-ging! Ga-ging!

36:14.639 --> 36:15.940
And you throw in the heat, baby.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.408
All right, I'll get
too big for my britches,

36:17.508 --> 36:19.377
giving you the opening
to blow your comeback.

36:19.477 --> 36:20.845
The house is on fire.
The crowd is going crazy.

36:20.945 --> 36:22.413
Then you pick me up
over your head.

36:22.413 --> 36:25.183
Then it's bombs away
in that dirty-ass dumpster.

36:25.283 --> 36:27.852
Aye, don't you dare come
short of that damn dumpster.

36:27.952 --> 36:29.253
Oh, I'm throwing you
past the dumpster.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.622
Oh, don't do that, baby.

36:31.622 --> 36:33.624
That riff was cool.

36:33.724 --> 36:35.406
Just going over the match
one more time.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.595
What, you never saw
a preshow walkthrough before?

36:37.695 --> 36:39.163
Dad didn't let me
backstage much.

36:39.263 --> 36:42.567
Well, he should have.
We would have crushed it.

36:42.667 --> 36:43.734
Thanks for saying that.

36:43.834 --> 36:44.835
I mean it.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.103
You worked hard this week, Ace.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.139
Sack up.
You're the king's son, dude.

36:48.239 --> 36:50.308
Yeah, that means
you the prince,

36:50.408 --> 36:51.576
or at least one of 'em.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.178
All right, men.

36:58.115 --> 36:59.717
Closures are the endings
that we need

36:59.817 --> 37:01.986
to finish things appropriately.

37:02.086 --> 37:04.422
This is not a goodbye.

37:04.522 --> 37:05.856
This is a sendoff.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.592
Hear, hear.
Bring it in.

37:08.839 --> 37:10.194
Hey, come on.

37:10.294 --> 37:12.129
- Let's do it.
- Right.

37:13.631 --> 37:14.765
King Spade on three.

37:14.865 --> 37:15.733
One, two, three!

37:15.833 --> 37:17.048
King Spade!

37:18.536 --> 37:19.770
Hi, everybody.

37:19.870 --> 37:22.506
My name is Willie.

37:22.607 --> 37:25.743
Think I know most of y'all.

37:25.843 --> 37:27.578
Some of you been
coming here for years,

37:27.678 --> 37:30.047
and I wanna thank you for that.

37:30.147 --> 37:33.017
Tonight, we close the curtain

37:33.117 --> 37:35.486
on our time here at the DWL.

37:35.586 --> 37:36.854
This'll be our final show.

37:36.954 --> 37:40.091
So thank you for all the years

37:40.191 --> 37:42.193
that you've been
a part of this.

37:42.293 --> 37:44.562
Fortunately, we haven't had
a lotta ten-bell salutes

37:44.662 --> 37:47.231
here at the Dome.

37:47.331 --> 37:50.301
Tonight, we do.

37:50.401 --> 37:53.137
We honor a man
who dreamt of bringing

37:53.237 --> 37:55.539
professional wrestling
to this part of Georgia.

37:55.640 --> 37:56.707
And he did.

37:56.807 --> 37:58.876
Tom Spade.

37:58.976 --> 38:03.848
So please stand,
remove your hats,

38:03.948 --> 38:08.452
and hold the Spade family,
especially Tom Spade,

38:08.452 --> 38:10.221
in your thoughts.

38:44.588 --> 38:46.691
King Spade!

38:46.791 --> 38:49.493
King Spade! King Spade!

38:49.593 --> 38:51.962
King Spade! King Spade!

38:52.063 --> 38:56.967
King Spade! King Spade!

38:57.068 --> 39:00.971
King Spade! King Spade!
King Spade!

39:01.072 --> 39:03.387
That's right!
That's right!

39:03.507 --> 39:06.744
The last thing the king would
want is a quiet crowd!

39:06.844 --> 39:09.013
So how about we get
to some rasslin'?

39:26.364 --> 39:29.934
♪ She slipped away ♪

39:31.435 --> 39:33.718
Whoo!

39:54.658 --> 39:56.093
♪ It's more than a feeling ♪

39:58.062 --> 40:01.165
♪ When I hear that
Old song they used to play ♪

40:01.265 --> 40:02.867
♪ More than a feeling ♪

40:05.903 --> 40:07.304
♪ More than a feeling ♪

40:07.405 --> 40:10.975
♪ Till I see Marianne
Walk away ♪

40:25.556 --> 40:27.958
I'm nervous, man.
I never get nervous.

40:28.058 --> 40:29.260
Not in the huddle,
not on the pitcher's mound,

40:29.360 --> 40:31.529
not playing cards,
not with a girl.

40:31.529 --> 40:33.464
First time I took you
cliff jumping at the quarry,

40:33.564 --> 40:34.632
you were nervous.

40:34.732 --> 40:36.867
I was eight.

40:36.967 --> 40:39.703
You leapt, splashed, lived.

40:39.804 --> 40:41.872
You were so happy,
you almost drowned laughing.

40:41.972 --> 40:43.707
You'll survive this.

40:44.909 --> 40:46.844
Nah. Nah, man. Dad was right.

40:46.944 --> 40:47.878
I ain't--I ain't
meant for this.

40:47.978 --> 40:49.280
Hey.

40:49.380 --> 40:52.516
Dad's judgment's
now forever in question.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.984
All right,
you're a quarterback, Ace.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.019
You're a player.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.687
Players play.

40:59.490 --> 41:00.891
Just don't let me look stupid.

41:00.991 --> 41:02.339
I-I won't.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.961
Run the plays that I called.

41:04.061 --> 41:05.696
You'll be good.

41:09.099 --> 41:12.069
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jack Spade.

41:24.248 --> 41:27.017
Thank you.
Duffy, Georgia.

41:27.117 --> 41:29.153
Thank you very much
for being here tonight

41:29.253 --> 41:32.790
and celebrating my dad,
honoring him.

41:35.226 --> 41:38.162
You know,
he wasn't just my dad.

41:38.262 --> 41:41.098
He was a father to everyone
in the DWL family.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.704
We will miss him dearly.

41:46.804 --> 41:49.173
Let's play his entrance music
one last time.

41:56.614 --> 42:00.050
Well, well, well, Duffy,
it's my younger brother,

42:00.150 --> 42:04.088
Ace Spade, Duffy High
state football champ!

42:11.929 --> 42:13.364
Hey, Duffy.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.366
Look, I know I ain't wrestled
in the Dome before,

42:15.466 --> 42:17.635
But, uh, I am a Spade,
so I wanna honor

42:17.735 --> 42:20.070
my father's legacy
a-along with all of you,

42:20.170 --> 42:21.272
if you'll have me.

42:30.180 --> 42:33.183
You know, life wasn't easy
growing up a Spade.

42:33.284 --> 42:35.252
You know, son to a-a king,

42:35.352 --> 42:39.423
brother to the so-called
rightful heir,

42:39.523 --> 42:42.426
Jack, the eldest,
the true prince.

42:44.094 --> 42:46.730
Anyone with a big brother
knows the drill.

42:46.830 --> 42:49.567
Not always fun.

42:49.667 --> 42:51.335
You got some stones
showing up here tonight

42:51.435 --> 42:53.103
wearing Dad's robe!

42:53.203 --> 42:56.640
But I'll tell you what,
baby brother.

42:56.740 --> 42:59.557
You think I'm
the so-called rightful heir.

42:59.677 --> 43:02.780
Oh, he's gon' say,
"We settle things in the ring."

43:02.780 --> 43:05.249
In this family,

43:05.349 --> 43:07.051
we settle things in the ring.

43:16.293 --> 43:17.875
That's real good shit
right there.

43:17.995 --> 43:19.129
You sell the pain,
you let me lead.

43:19.229 --> 43:20.464
Get away from me!

43:20.464 --> 43:22.179
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

43:22.299 --> 43:23.434
Hey, back off! Back off.

43:23.534 --> 43:25.135
You ready? You ready?

43:25.235 --> 43:26.670
Are we? You ready?

44:14.952 --> 44:16.353
Yeah!

44:32.202 --> 44:33.804
Oh, gosh!

44:35.239 --> 44:36.240
Jack, you all right?

44:36.340 --> 44:37.841
- Yeah.
- Jack!

44:37.941 --> 44:39.009
Jack, you good, man?

44:39.109 --> 44:40.244
Can you continue?

44:46.016 --> 44:48.419
- Come on, Jack!
- Oh!

44:55.359 --> 44:57.127
Come on, Jack,
get him out of the corner.

44:59.363 --> 45:00.964
How about that, huh?

45:01.065 --> 45:01.999
Oh, sh--

45:12.523 --> 45:14.244
Jack, what do you say?

45:22.119 --> 45:23.454
Oh, my goodness!

45:25.122 --> 45:27.491
One! Two!

45:27.591 --> 45:28.926
Two! Only two!

45:29.026 --> 45:31.528
That was only two! Two.

45:51.395 --> 45:52.796
One, two--

45:52.916 --> 45:54.685
Bam!

45:54.785 --> 45:56.420
Jack, let me go for top rope.

45:56.520 --> 45:57.821
We're about to get outta here
with the roll-up.

45:57.921 --> 45:59.590
Let's go home
with the crowd still hot.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.158
It's the last time, dude.

46:01.258 --> 46:02.593
If I get hurt,
it won't even matter.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.128
Come on.

46:04.128 --> 46:05.963
Okay.

46:06.063 --> 46:07.064
All right, let's go. Come on!

46:19.209 --> 46:20.944
Come on, Ace,
what are you doing?

46:49.072 --> 46:50.674
One, two, three!

46:50.774 --> 46:52.376
And there we go!

47:17.301 --> 47:21.572
King Spade! King Spade!
King Spade! King Spade!

47:21.672 --> 47:25.509
King Spade! King Spade!
King Spade! King Spade!

47:25.609 --> 47:29.079
King Spade! King Spade!
King Spade! King Spade!

47:29.179 --> 47:32.950
King Spade! King Spade!
King Spade! King Spade!

47:33.050 --> 47:36.820
King Spade! King Spade!
King Spade! King Spade!

47:36.920 --> 47:40.190
King Spade! King Spade!
King Spade! King Spade!

47:50.300 --> 47:51.902
Here comes the man!

47:59.009 --> 48:00.944
- Amazing, Jack.
- Impressive.

48:01.044 --> 48:04.047
- Yeah!
- You did it!

48:04.147 --> 48:05.515
Hey, you were incredible.

48:05.616 --> 48:06.950
No, you were, man!

48:07.050 --> 48:08.652
The crowd is so loud!
They're still going.

48:08.752 --> 48:10.467
It was a good way to go out.

48:10.567 --> 48:11.989
Mmm, best feeling ever.

48:12.089 --> 48:13.657
Better than when I won
the state championship.

48:13.757 --> 48:15.259
You won that state championship

48:15.259 --> 48:16.894
on a bullshit pass
interference call.

48:16.994 --> 48:18.962
Hey, I don't ref the games.
I just play 'em.

48:19.062 --> 48:21.064
Fate wanted me winning
the state championship.

48:21.965 --> 48:26.270
I don't know how you picked
all that up in a week,

48:26.370 --> 48:28.672
but there are wrestlers
that work their entire careers,

48:28.772 --> 48:31.174
don't tap
into what you just did.

48:34.011 --> 48:35.779
You got it.

48:35.879 --> 48:38.148
Thanks for saying that, Jack.

48:40.217 --> 48:42.986
It's not stupid.

48:43.086 --> 48:45.088
Say again?

48:45.188 --> 48:48.659
This is not a stupid thing,
this thing.

48:48.759 --> 48:51.495
It's an amazing thing.

48:51.595 --> 48:55.732
The fraternity
and the camaraderie,

48:55.832 --> 48:58.769
it's so far
from a stupid thing.

48:58.869 --> 49:00.170
I agree.

49:01.638 --> 49:02.873
We should keep doin' it.

49:07.311 --> 49:08.245
You serious?

49:08.345 --> 49:09.313
We should make this

49:09.313 --> 49:10.647
into what it could have been,

49:10.747 --> 49:12.382
what we just proved
that it can be

49:12.482 --> 49:13.917
if we work together.

49:16.286 --> 49:19.489
We can pull this off.

49:19.589 --> 49:24.061
We just have to--
we're gonna have to work hard,

49:24.161 --> 49:29.199
trust, grind,
have each other's backs.

49:30.647 --> 49:32.035
Remember when we'd fight
as kids,

49:32.135 --> 49:34.972
and Dad would make us
shake hands and say that?

49:35.072 --> 49:36.873
Yeah, maybe we should have
said it before we fought.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.976
Stop the fighting upfront.

49:41.979 --> 49:44.147
I got your back, brother.

49:45.749 --> 49:47.230
- You crushed it.
- Aww, thank you.

49:47.351 --> 49:48.819
- Hey.
- Hi.

49:53.023 --> 49:54.624
- Hey, come on.
- All right, get a room.

49:54.725 --> 49:55.792
- Shut up.
- Get a room.

49:55.892 --> 49:57.027
Shut up.

50:14.811 --> 50:16.113
This is Ace.

50:16.213 --> 50:17.681
Leave a message,
and I'll hit you back.

50:23.787 --> 50:26.089
Ricky, you're a part
of the DWL family now,

50:26.189 --> 50:27.457
like it or not.

50:27.457 --> 50:29.493
Oh, I like it more
than you know, Bobby.

50:29.493 --> 50:31.194
I'm Diego.

50:33.430 --> 50:34.731
Congrats again, superstar.

50:34.831 --> 50:36.433
Thanks, Ref.

50:36.533 --> 50:38.235
- Yeah.
- See you back in Duffy.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.719
Please tell me
that y'all saw that.

50:55.819 --> 50:56.987
You got a pretty face, bro,

50:57.087 --> 50:58.722
but I ain't looking at you
24/7.

50:58.822 --> 51:00.424
All right, guys,
I'm the only one

51:00.524 --> 51:02.092
who's gotta wake up
with a baby.

51:27.317 --> 51:29.086
Attaboy, Ace.

51:29.186 --> 51:30.420
Attaboy.

51:52.342 --> 51:53.510
Hey.

51:53.610 --> 51:55.846
Got your message. Congratulations.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.881
It's been
a crazy busy night here.

51:57.981 --> 51:59.983
Everyone's finally in bed.

52:00.083 --> 52:01.885
How'd the singing go?

52:01.985 --> 52:04.321
Not gonna lie, I nailed it.

52:04.421 --> 52:05.489
Course you did.

52:05.589 --> 52:06.556
Stayed on key.

52:06.656 --> 52:08.058
Didn't muff lyrics.

52:08.158 --> 52:10.460
Didn't sing
"gallivantly steamy."

52:10.560 --> 52:12.596
I got video.

52:12.696 --> 52:14.965
I should have been there.

52:15.065 --> 52:17.400
Tell me about the fair.

52:17.501 --> 52:19.736
I told Ace about the Kleenex.

52:22.339 --> 52:26.576
I bet that was hard to do.
Hard to admit.

52:26.676 --> 52:28.645
Takes guts, Jack.

52:29.412 --> 52:32.582
Well, I waited
till the end of the match.

52:32.682 --> 52:34.217
It was not ideal.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.852
There was probably
never an ideal time.

52:35.952 --> 52:38.054
- What'd he say?
- Uh, he said, "Fuck you.

52:38.155 --> 52:40.657
I'm gon' fuckin' kill you."
Then a lotta fuck-yous.

52:40.757 --> 52:43.760
I don't know, the whole thing
was a little bit of a blur.

52:43.860 --> 52:45.562
I mean, he reacted
the way I thought he would,

52:45.662 --> 52:47.430
maybe worse.

52:49.399 --> 52:52.135
Now I'm tryin' to figure why
I thought it'd be a good thing.

52:54.271 --> 52:55.438
Which part?

52:55.539 --> 52:57.741
Throwin' the Kleenex part
or the apology part?

52:57.841 --> 52:59.543
Both.

52:59.643 --> 53:02.579
The truth is
a good thing, Jack,

53:02.679 --> 53:05.815
even though it may not seem
that way.

53:05.916 --> 53:07.617
I'm sorry it went badly.

53:10.453 --> 53:12.622
The fair went well.

53:12.722 --> 53:13.690
We delivered.

53:13.790 --> 53:15.525
Proved that we belong.

53:18.061 --> 53:20.063
Folks kept coming up to me
after the show,

53:20.163 --> 53:22.499
telling me how proud
my dad would have been.

53:22.599 --> 53:25.001
They're right. He would be.

53:25.101 --> 53:27.304
And then
the entire drive home,

53:27.404 --> 53:30.473
I thought about
how I don't miss him.

53:32.008 --> 53:36.313
I have not missed my dad
one day since he shot himself.

53:36.413 --> 53:41.084
Not one... day.

53:41.885 --> 53:43.486
And I know
it probably doesn't make me

53:43.587 --> 53:46.489
the face that you married,
but I am admittin'...

53:48.892 --> 53:50.894
...to being that guy.

53:54.798 --> 53:57.300
I'm the guy who named
his own son

53:57.400 --> 54:00.270
after his dead dad
that he don't miss.

54:05.008 --> 54:06.676
And I'm sorry
if that scares you.

54:06.776 --> 54:09.279
It scares me.

54:09.379 --> 54:11.181
No, it'd scare me

54:11.281 --> 54:13.984
if you couldn't talk
about how you feel

54:14.084 --> 54:15.785
and, rather than
not think about it,

54:15.885 --> 54:18.888
pretend you think
something else.

54:18.989 --> 54:20.724
And we gave Thomas that name

54:20.824 --> 54:22.859
before your dad did
what he did.

54:22.959 --> 54:25.428
We could change his name,
start calling him Keith.

54:28.632 --> 54:30.133
I didn't marry a face, Jack.

54:30.233 --> 54:33.737
I married a guy
named Jack Spade,

54:33.837 --> 54:36.573
a good guy
named after a face card.

54:38.074 --> 54:41.144
A good guy
who's had a hard year.

54:41.244 --> 54:46.316
We all have, but you and Ace
and your mom most of all.

54:47.183 --> 54:49.586
And, Jack, the reason I said
how you act is who you are

54:49.686 --> 54:52.055
is because I didn't fall
in love with Tom Spade's son.

54:52.155 --> 54:54.758
I fell in love
with the nice guy

54:54.858 --> 54:57.861
at a great party.

54:57.961 --> 55:00.497
It was good you told Ace.

55:00.597 --> 55:03.733
In theory, yeah.

55:03.833 --> 55:05.168
He was so pissed.

55:05.268 --> 55:06.970
Tomorrow's a new day.

55:07.070 --> 55:08.405
You could talk to him more.

55:08.505 --> 55:09.572
Give him time.

55:11.808 --> 55:13.977
He loves you.

55:14.077 --> 55:16.513
Get some rest.

55:16.613 --> 55:18.615
I will rest when you're home.

55:21.651 --> 55:22.952
I need you here, Staci.

55:23.053 --> 55:24.554
I need you in our home.

55:26.790 --> 55:28.491
I'm not half as good
without you here.

55:28.591 --> 55:31.528
I'm less than half as good.

55:31.628 --> 55:33.263
Let's talk tomorrow.

55:34.364 --> 55:35.932
I love you.

55:36.032 --> 55:38.635
I love you too.

55:38.735 --> 55:40.236
How's Thomas do--

56:43.266 --> 56:44.601
This is Ace.

56:44.701 --> 56:46.603
