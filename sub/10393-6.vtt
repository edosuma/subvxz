13:20.400 --> 13:21.567
As I understand a lot of them

13:21.568 --> 13:23.369
are pretty pissed off about

13:23.370 --> 13:26.205
we're just getting our [ Muted ]

13:26.206 --> 13:29.008
Together and all these Congolese

13:29.009 --> 13:33.013
and Nigerians are coming here.

13:42.122 --> 13:47.393
Sanza has no formal
culinary training.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.929
He's completely self-taught.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.731
Picking up bits and
pieces when we can.

13:52.732 --> 13:53.900
Often from the women
in the neighborhood.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.202
You're plucking the best of
everybody in the culture.

13:56.203 --> 13:56.769
Every day.

13:56.770 --> 14:00.406
Every day I learn.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.241
What are you eating?

14:02.242 --> 14:03.876
From you from?

14:03.877 --> 14:06.478
I've been taught by some men.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.981
That's not how it's
cooked at home, you know?

14:08.982 --> 14:10.416
Go to that auntie.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.584
To the back of some dingy cab.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.720
There's a small kitchen.

14:14.721 --> 14:19.158
Look, there, it'll be nice.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.427
Hey, auntie, you know, I'm

14:21.428 --> 14:23.495
really keen on knowing how you

14:23.496 --> 14:24.663
make your particular sauce.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.798
They'll show you?

14:26.799 --> 14:27.767
I pick up.

14:27.768 --> 14:30.469
Then I rush back to the
shop and I try it out.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.604
At his cook shop he mixes

14:32.605 --> 14:34.406
recipes, ingredients, techniques

14:34.407 --> 14:35.807
and traditions as he sees fit.

14:35.808 --> 14:39.611
One reviewer described his style

14:39.612 --> 14:41.981
as gastronomic smuggling.

14:41.982 --> 14:45.084
Moving people across borders
with dishes that slightly

14:45.085 --> 14:46.919
partake of elsewhere.

14:46.920 --> 14:54.920
On today's menu it sha...
I made this for you.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.528
This is egusi and beef.

14:56.529 --> 15:00.666
Beef stewed with melon
and pumpkin SIDS.

15:00.667 --> 15:01.634
There's futu.

15:01.635 --> 15:09.308
The you biktous
cornmeal porridge.

15:09.309 --> 15:17.309
Made from a texture more
crumbley than pap.

15:18.685 --> 15:19.652
Good taste.

15:19.652 --> 15:20.387
Oh, yeah.

15:20.388 --> 15:21.653
Awesome.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.489
Good food here.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.991
Menu change every day?

15:24.992 --> 15:28.327
You do a lot of great
food in a small space.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.328
There were no seats.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.863
His customers remain part of the

15:31.864 --> 15:34.633
constantly unfolding
street theater of Yoville.

15:34.634 --> 15:38.038
They mingle, talk, observe.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.512
With food, I knew food
is a way to engage.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.847
Got to put something in your

15:48.848 --> 15:53.353
mouth to get your
ears open, you know.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.656
♪

15:59.526 --> 16:01.860
Across town, another
pioneer of sorts.

16:01.861 --> 16:05.431
An urban settler in a very
different neighborhood.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.533
This is Hillbrow.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.601
A notoriously
dangerous district.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.204
And this is DeeJay Lez.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.507
When I came here, I always
dreamed of being a musician.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.510
I see myself singing in front of

16:18.511 --> 16:21.113
huge crowds, you know,
making money in the process.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.082
That's what I dreamt about.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.050
He spins records and promotes

16:24.051 --> 16:25.884
acts and events in nightclubs.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.553
We meet in his favorite spot.

16:27.554 --> 16:32.358
Sympathy's restaurant.

16:32.359 --> 16:32.892
What's good?

16:32.893 --> 16:34.526
What do you like?

16:34.527 --> 16:35.527
That looks good.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.862
Is that fried chicken?

16:36.863 --> 16:38.764
That's the fried chicken.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.299
The place is heavy with the

16:40.300 --> 16:43.269
smell of frying chicken,
stewing Greens.

16:43.270 --> 16:44.037
Walk right up.

16:44.038 --> 16:45.038
Place your order.

16:45.039 --> 16:48.707
And be sure to get
some mill pap.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.610
Heaped on a plate with beats and

16:51.611 --> 16:53.479
coleslaw that's a
nice, heavy base.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.746
Tell me about the neighborhood.

16:54.747 --> 16:59.985
When I first came, it
was rough, my friend.

16:59.986 --> 17:02.821
Before '92, it was like
white business district?

17:02.822 --> 17:03.456
Residential district?

17:03.457 --> 17:06.392
Back then, it used to be clean.

17:06.393 --> 17:11.762
Used to be respected.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.933
Once Hillbrow was an elite
whites only center of town.

17:14.934 --> 17:19.105
But when things started to
change, so did Hillbrow.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.339
Becoming one of the first gray

17:20.339 --> 17:23.275
areas where whites
and blacks mixed.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.576
Hillbrow became aspirational.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.578
A symbol of everything black

17:26.579 --> 17:28.446
Africans had long been denied.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.782
But was now accessible.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.518
People poured in
in large numbers.

17:32.519 --> 17:37.289
Many of them squatters from
all over the continent.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.759
People come here, they come
here with one intention.

17:40.760 --> 17:45.131
Making a living.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.799
Making money.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.135
Started coming here.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.137
White landlords and tenants

17:51.138 --> 17:53.672
simply walked away
from their property.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.807
The disenfranchised who moved in

17:55.808 --> 17:57.443
legally, semilegally, illegally

17:57.444 --> 18:01.012
or just squatting, an influx
of gangs and criminal

18:01.013 --> 18:04.383
organizations, the area
soon slipped into anarchy.

18:04.384 --> 18:09.321
There's a saying around here.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.157
Okay?

18:11.158 --> 18:14.826
This building's been hijacked.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.995
Everything that could
go wrong, did.

18:16.996 --> 18:20.466
People make a living
from different things.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.234
Some hurt people
to make a living.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.002
Some they sell their bodies.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.504
Sometimes things aren't always

18:25.505 --> 18:28.474
according to what you plan.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.808
This is where I live.

18:29.809 --> 18:36.215
This is where my life is.

18:36.216 --> 18:42.388
I'll show you.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.691
We talk down the street and
one of the many enterprises

18:45.692 --> 18:47.259
doing business on corners and in

18:47.260 --> 18:51.197
doorways around us becomes
alarmed at the sight of our

18:51.198 --> 18:51.431
cameras.

18:51.432 --> 18:55.834
Soon there's a mob of very
angry people coming our way.

18:55.835 --> 19:00.439
We do not turn around our
cameras for obvious reasons.

19:00.440 --> 19:06.345
These days things are
slowly, slowly improving.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.914
But before, we wouldn't
walk this freely.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.216
Now we are free.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.884
There's actual law enforcement
going on in fits and

19:12.885 --> 19:13.119
starts.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.222
And that's making a difference.

19:16.223 --> 19:19.958
Black owned legitimate
businesses have gained a real

19:19.959 --> 19:20.727
foothold.

19:20.728 --> 19:22.794
There are new revitalization

19:22.795 --> 19:26.031
projects like farmer's
markets springing up.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.466
Buildings are being reclaimed.

19:27.467 --> 19:32.571
And people here hope that
Hillbrow is past the bad old

19:32.572 --> 19:32.772
days.

19:32.773 --> 19:34.273
There's no fear now.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.807
You have to relax.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.211
Nothing will happen to you.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.935
>What's in a name?

20:36.936 --> 20:39.271
If the name is Soweto, you best

20:39.272 --> 20:45.711
believe it means plenty.

20:45.712 --> 20:46.945
This is Madu.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.714
For over a decade he's been in

20:48.715 --> 20:50.316
what has at times been the very

20:50.317 --> 20:52.851
difficult business
of driving a taxi.

20:52.852 --> 20:53.786
You should probably know that

20:53.787 --> 20:56.221
the word taxi in Soweto means

20:56.222 --> 21:02.661
something a little different
than, say, New York.

21:02.662 --> 21:07.399
How many taxis do
you have in Soweto?

21:07.400 --> 21:10.636
This coming from a particular
passenger means Soweto.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.237
Also this and this.

21:12.238 --> 21:15.341
Johannesburg has an elaborate
system of hand signals

21:15.342 --> 21:17.676
indicating desired
routes of travel.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.346
You're looking at the hand

21:20.347 --> 21:21.347
signals and say I'm not going

21:21.348 --> 21:22.248
there, I'm not going there.

21:22.249 --> 21:24.282
I'm looking at hand sayingals.

21:24.283 --> 21:31.990
In 1994 Soweto came into
being as workers lodging.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.992
A place to put black laborers

21:33.993 --> 21:35.527
comfortably removed
from white society.

21:35.528 --> 21:36.095
A ghetto.

21:36.096 --> 21:37.863
By the 1950s it had become the

21:37.864 --> 21:40.599
center of resistance
to white rule.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.767
Synonymous with the struggle

21:41.768 --> 21:48.207
against the whole
rotten racist system.

22:28.214 --> 22:34.586
Now there is a definite carhe

22:34.587 --> 22:36.287
to having lived in Soweto.

22:36.288 --> 22:37.789
A very real pride back at being

22:37.790 --> 22:38.990
in the center of things when it

22:38.991 --> 22:40.592
was hard and dangerous
to have an opinion.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.228
Nelson Mandela lived here.

22:43.229 --> 22:44.496
Desmond tutu.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.764
When you're of certain age and

22:45.765 --> 22:47.599
you say you were born and bred

22:47.600 --> 22:49.401
in Soweto, it means something.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.603
Do mostly people own
their homes or rent?

22:51.604 --> 22:53.739
Mostly people own their homes.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.240
Things start to get
a little better.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.341
Can you build up?

22:56.342 --> 22:57.342
You can build up.

22:57.343 --> 22:58.444
Look at the streets here and

22:58.445 --> 22:59.845
you see what that
kind of pride does.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.748
It may not be a rich area,
but it's immaculate.

23:02.749 --> 23:03.416
Squared away.

23:03.417 --> 23:05.150
An emerging middle class coming

23:05.151 --> 23:13.151
up, rather than
fleeing to elsewhere.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.635
You know where
you're going, right?

23:23.636 --> 23:24.136
Yeah.

23:24.137 --> 23:29.475
I know where I'm going.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.376
Next exit?

23:31.377 --> 23:33.311
Smoky delicious meat over flame.

Under the overpass, all sorts of

23:37.517 --> 23:39.518
The taxi man's lunch.

23:39.519 --> 23:44.490

some sausage, some heart.

Beautiful thing.

of Bible thumping Dutch settlers

24:32.539 --> 24:35.907
about them, they
were a tough bunch.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.176
In the 1800s the British came.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.878
Diamonds were discovered.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.379
Greed heads jockeyed for power.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.715
There was war, and an ugly one.

In the end there was an
uneasy shares of power.

as Afrikaners.

Afrikaners ideology grew.

Yeah.

liberal guilt sensibility.

It just wouldn't be accepted.

She's known for her playful
menus but loathes culinary

26:22.715 --> 26:22.949
fashion.

26:22.950 --> 26:26.384
She strives for a locally
grounded cuisine.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.686
Today, she's my guide
through this twilight zone.

♪

26:31.023 --> 26:32.023
It's weird here.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.825
And though I'm told the place

26:33.826 --> 26:35.226
usually reflects the changing

26:35.227 --> 26:43.227
demographic of modern south
Africa, today, not so much.

26:45.337 --> 26:53.337
The customers may or may not
have feelings about the

26:53.412 --> 26:55.180
Afrikaner memorabilia.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.915
Really they just come for meat.

26:56.916 --> 27:00.351
Choose t-bone, rum steak.

27:00.352 --> 27:06.224
Spicy sausage made
from beef and pork.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.994
Our secret ingredient
is monkey gland sauce.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.196
Every steak house has
monkey gland sauce.

27:11.197 --> 27:12.197
It's barbecue sauce.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.665
They cook it up along with

27:13.666 --> 27:15.500
some pap and fries and presto.

27:15.501 --> 27:19.437
A colon clogging pile of
meat in the ruins of empire.

27:19.438 --> 27:19.872
Yeah.

27:19.873 --> 27:23.875
I mean, meat is a
very big thing.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.076
There's enough of it, I think.

27:25.077 --> 27:25.577
Good lord.

27:25.578 --> 27:28.213
I can swim in it.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.881
Tastes like oppression.

After this show airs, I'm
going to get a huge amount of

27:33.185 --> 27:36.221
mail says why didn't
you go to Capetown?

27:36.222 --> 27:37.723
Great modern restaurants.

27:37.724 --> 27:38.457
Cutting edge chefs.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.425
Is it all right I
missed all that?

27:40.426 --> 27:42.861
I feel like those particular

27:42.862 --> 27:45.764
restaurants in Capetown are not

27:45.765 --> 27:46.598
really representative of what

27:46.599 --> 27:48.633
most people in this
country are eating.

27:48.634 --> 27:50.902
I think a lot of our most basic

27:50.903 --> 27:52.938
stuff is really what we do best.

27:52.939 --> 27:57.042
This food is absolutely got
no interest in fashion.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.810
It's never going to change.

27:58.811 --> 28:02.748
There'll still be the
monkey gland sauce.

28:02.749 --> 28:04.783
You think the white chefs
here understand the greatest

28:04.784 --> 28:07.218
advantage they have is that this

28:07.219 --> 28:13.091
enormous pan African larder of

28:13.092 --> 28:14.793
ingredients and flavors?

28:14.794 --> 28:15.061
No.

28:15.062 --> 28:16.294
If you're a whitey in the city

28:16.295 --> 28:17.428
you're probably going to eat the

28:17.429 --> 28:19.831
worst food of anyone in
the city, quite honestly.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.933
In every country, obviously
food is political.

28:21.934 --> 28:25.570
It always feels like it's a
bit more political here.

28:25.571 --> 28:26.938
That there are these layers of

28:26.939 --> 28:29.407
things that you couldn't have.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.242
Like restaurants.

28:30.243 --> 28:31.642
I go to restaurants.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.611
I think to myself, wow, this

28:33.612 --> 28:34.913
many years ago, I couldn't have

28:34.914 --> 28:36.281
come here with this person.

28:36.282 --> 28:39.017
They were not allowed
to sit in here.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.819
And I remember very
clearly being around 8.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.789
The cafe owner would regularly

28:43.790 --> 28:47.793
not pay the customer who
was black with change.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.761
He would pay him
with bubble gum.

28:49.762 --> 28:54.032
And the guy somehow,
he couldn't argue.

28:54.033 --> 28:57.468
If you were a black guy, you got

28:57.469 --> 29:00.171
your change in bubble gum.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.774
I was 8 years old feeling like,

29:02.775 --> 29:04.442
oh, my god, it was so terrible.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.844
But you couldn't say anything.

29:05.845 --> 29:10.949
Because that would
have been worse.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.451
It represented such badness.

29:13.452 --> 29:16.755
It just seems mad.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.519
>This is an elan.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.656
The largest antelope

30:19.685 --> 30:21.953
It's a little sad.

30:21.954 --> 30:23.188
You know what?

30:23.189 --> 30:24.722
That is such good meat.

30:24.723 --> 30:29.260
That's really what we do.

30:29.261 --> 30:35.133
Though this one weighs in
around a ton, rest assured,

30:35.134 --> 30:40.238
every bite, every
scrap, will be eaten.

publisher of the slyly

31:00.726 --> 31:01.427

miles from Johannesburg.

31:28.487 --> 31:36.487
we, the human animal, came from.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.030
It's a classic little sink hole.

There are loads of these.

It's called a cradle.

31:43.602 --> 31:46.037
Now a world heritage site.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.205
Because 60% of all the evidence

for human evolution comes
out of the valley.

39:09.581 --> 39:12.717
I like the idea of a burger for

39:12.718 --> 39:15.453
breakfast or is there something
perverse about that.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.988
Throw in a crowd of much more

39:17.989 --> 39:19.757
diverse and hungry people, and

39:19.758 --> 39:21.726
you might think
you're in Brooklyn.

39:21.727 --> 39:25.630
Surely, this is not a bad thing.

39:25.631 --> 39:30.000
This is neighbor goods
market in Johannesburg.

39:30.001 --> 39:33.270
My dining companion features

39:33.271 --> 39:40.144
writer Percy Mumbando says
we should hold out for this.

39:40.145 --> 39:44.248
One with lots of cheese.

39:44.249 --> 39:50.254
Flattened ground beef
sered over flames.

39:50.255 --> 39:52.790
Cook the food right.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.792
Add mozzarella cheese, fold

39:54.793 --> 39:59.096
it up, pick your condiments.

39:59.097 --> 40:03.367
Ka badge, tomato, onion,
lettuce, hot peppers.

40:03.368 --> 40:09.440
Up to the roof with
a view and eat.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.141
Spicy.

40:10.141 --> 40:10.509
Good.

40:10.510 --> 40:12.610
I guess I want to talk
about Nelson Mandela.

40:12.611 --> 40:14.945
Because what I was not aware of

40:14.946 --> 40:18.949
at all was the degree to which

40:18.950 --> 40:19.551
he was personally responsible

40:19.552 --> 40:23.353
for really the nuts and bolts of

40:23.354 --> 40:30.461
the transition from white
rule to majority rule.

40:30.462 --> 40:31.662
Now he's very ill.

40:31.663 --> 40:31.997
Reporter:

40:31.998 --> 40:33.030
Yeah, yeah.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.364
What happens after Mandela?

40:34.365 --> 40:38.235
We go on.

40:38.236 --> 40:42.139
And I think through god
we have him as a symbol.

40:42.140 --> 40:45.375
I think Mandela
represents our nation.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.177
The test we use to
check the way forth.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.813
All the things that could

40:48.814 --> 40:51.248
have gone terribly wrong, it's a

40:51.249 --> 40:54.585
remarkable thing
how well it went.

40:54.586 --> 40:58.489
Between 1990 and 1994, tough

40:58.490 --> 41:02.827
times, you know, into
the city fighting.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.496
Black-on-black violence.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.431
Black-on-white violence.

41:06.432 --> 41:10.568
But we transcended that coming

41:10.569 --> 41:14.271
together regardless of
the unresolved issues.

41:14.272 --> 41:17.341
What extent are
things getting mixed?

41:17.342 --> 41:19.343
We like to think we live in a

41:19.344 --> 41:21.378
rainbow nation, but in fact, in

41:21.379 --> 41:25.783
the states like to a great
extent in different

41:25.784 --> 41:26.117
neighborhoods.

41:26.118 --> 41:29.787
In some ways it looks to me

41:29.788 --> 41:31.455
outside looking in a little more

41:31.456 --> 41:35.025
gracefully mixed up than
we've managed in the states.

41:35.026 --> 41:38.462
Here you've got black, white,

41:38.463 --> 41:41.398
colored, all sorts
of people here.

41:41.399 --> 41:43.233
Also once you have the knowledge

41:43.234 --> 41:45.903
that the economic disparities

41:45.904 --> 41:49.707
are managing to keep
us divided as well.

41:49.708 --> 41:52.209
I think what we need to do is

41:52.210 --> 41:56.547
unpack what we mean by rainbow.

41:56.548 --> 41:58.716
I think being diverse also means

41:58.717 --> 42:00.551
that there'll be
moments of discord.

42:00.552 --> 42:04.154
And you think things will
continue to improve?

42:04.155 --> 42:05.056
Yeah.

42:05.057 --> 42:06.090
I think we've seen our worst.

42:06.091 --> 42:07.491
And that's not to say that we're

42:07.492 --> 42:10.260
getting it right all the time.

42:10.261 --> 42:12.897
But it's an experiment you need

42:12.898 --> 42:14.899
to find as you go along.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.567
That's really the
south African story.

42:16.568 --> 42:18.803
The dream is there.

42:18.804 --> 42:21.238
We all agree that the
visions are there.

42:21.239 --> 42:24.341
But these are not
bigger than our hopes.

42:24.342 --> 42:27.477
What did I know about south
Africa before I game here?

42:27.478 --> 42:29.246
Exactly nothing,
as it turns out.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.682
But I think based on what I've

42:31.683 --> 42:33.818
seen, that if the world
can get it right here.

42:33.819 --> 42:36.520
A country with a past like south

42:36.521 --> 42:38.188
Africa's, if they can figure out

42:38.189 --> 42:40.424
how to make it work
here for everybody.

42:40.425 --> 42:43.661
Absorb all the people flooding
in from all over Africa,

42:43.662 --> 42:45.095
continue to make Mandela's dream

42:45.096 --> 42:48.433
a reality, maybe there's
hope for the rest of us.
