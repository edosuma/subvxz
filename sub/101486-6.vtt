How many of these
have you listened to?

02:01.330 --> 02:03.847
I don't know.
Just two or three a day.

02:03.866 --> 02:05.773
And then maybe a couple more
to take the edge off.

02:05.835 --> 02:09.186
And then one in the morning
just to get normal.

02:09.246 --> 02:11.779

02:28.858 --> 02:31.541
(grunts, scoffs) Oh.

02:31.643 --> 02:35.136

We need to talk about

02:55.792 --> 02:59.085
Why did he allow her

02:59.180 --> 03:01.405
What did Sergei know?

03:01.465 --> 03:04.165

We have much to discuss.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.926
Okay, pause.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.928
It's like
the police intentionally

03:08.022 --> 03:10.096
screwed up the investigation.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.416
Right? Drops of blood
you can explain,

03:12.434 --> 03:15.510
-but drops of brain?
-I know.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.362
Okay, play.

03:17.514 --> 03:20.590
Okay, pause. They totally
ignored the text messages

03:20.651 --> 03:24.185
-from the coroner's mistress.
-Okay, play. Play.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.371
-Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Oh. Oh.

03:26.564 --> 03:29.041
-Mm-mm. Oh, yeah.
-Hmm. Hmm.

03:30.360 --> 03:34.713
How could a woman
with four PhDs be so dumb?

03:34.864 --> 03:36.381
BOTH:
So dumb.

03:36.574 --> 03:39.125
I've never seen two people
agree with each other so much.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.961
I disagree. Come on, you two.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.704
We're supposed to visit
Grampa today.

03:42.765 --> 03:45.131
-Homie, we can't go.
-Our favorite podcast

03:45.226 --> 03:48.227
is recording a live episode,
and we have tickets.

03:48.420 --> 03:51.063
If we gasp loud enough,
we might hear ourselves.

03:51.256 --> 03:53.065
-(gasps loudly)
-(laughs)

03:53.258 --> 03:55.567
Save it for the show, Mom.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.295
Now, remember, Bart,

03:58.313 --> 04:00.964
Grampa's life is
very lonely and boring.

04:01.024 --> 04:04.301
So make sure to look at
your watch every few seconds

04:04.361 --> 04:06.060
so he knows you want to leave.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.729
Here, take some of these.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.960
Why is my dad's weird old tie
hanging on his doorknob?

If the bolo's a-hanging,
the dentures be clanging.

04:26.934 --> 04:30.084
This is my new girlfriend,
Vivienne Saint Charmaine.

04:30.145 --> 04:34.681
Abe-y, you didn't tell me your
brothers were coming to visit.

04:34.833 --> 04:37.834
-(laughs): Oh, well. Oh, my.
-Aw, shucks.

04:37.894 --> 04:41.262
Say, you look familiar.
Did you used to be younger?

04:41.323 --> 04:44.174
Vivienne was a big-time TV star.

04:44.192 --> 04:47.786
She was on all the hit shows,
and I was a huge fan.

04:47.937 --> 04:49.621
HOMER:
A little magazine.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.624
But you probably know me best
as the scheming yet conniving

04:52.817 --> 04:57.187
Olympic diver Darcy Covington
on<i> Falcon Landing.</i>

04:57.247 --> 04:59.113
Ma'am, if you're
a big shot has-been,

04:59.174 --> 05:01.541
why are you dating
a small-town never-was?

05:01.635 --> 05:04.027
All my life,
I dated unwrinkled men

05:04.087 --> 05:05.787
who told short, concise stories.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.882
But Abe here showed me
what I've been missing.

05:09.034 --> 05:11.343
-He's so sweet he should
come with an insulin pump.
-(chuckles)

05:11.537 --> 05:14.888
Well, thanks for stopping by,
but we've got two bingo games,

05:14.982 --> 05:17.649
a couple's colonoscopy...

05:19.878 --> 05:23.488
...and then we're off
to a romantic dinner cruise.

05:25.016 --> 05:26.974
-Dude.
-Bro.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.886
-Seriously.
-I know.

05:29.946 --> 05:32.664
(melancholy music playing)

05:34.710 --> 05:39.062

it's<i> Interminable,</i>

05:41.533 --> 05:46.419

05:46.513 --> 05:48.088

05:48.182 --> 05:50.907
Hello. I'm Tabitha Shingle.

05:50.967 --> 05:52.300
(cheering)

05:52.353 --> 05:54.853
She's even more dry in person.

05:55.046 --> 05:56.671
Some people look
at a neck and think,

05:56.690 --> 05:58.598
"What a great place
for a scarf,"

05:58.692 --> 06:01.843
and others think,
"I'd like to choke that."

06:01.862 --> 06:05.530
For Jackson Reeb of Lansing,
Michigan, it was the latter.

06:05.723 --> 06:07.657

06:11.246 --> 06:12.537

06:14.399 --> 06:16.600

Easy on the hurricane hold.

06:16.660 --> 06:19.619

on the podcast craze.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.271

06:21.289 --> 06:23.030
Flash-in-the-pan
wannabe journalism.

06:23.092 --> 06:25.158
Mark my words, Jerry,
nobody cares.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.460
Now to open this door.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.371
(crowd cheering)

06:30.391 --> 06:34.375
Our podcast has gotten
over 20 million downloads

06:34.395 --> 06:37.787
and is being adapted
into a streaming series

06:37.806 --> 06:42.884

on Amazon Prime.

This is Kent Brockman,
yesterday's news.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.096
And in the end, the donkey
turned out to be a horse.

07:11.247 --> 07:12.914
(sighs)
You're only watching this

07:12.933 --> 07:15.434
because somebody left the TV on
in a doctor's waiting room.

07:15.585 --> 07:17.769
W-Wait, w-wait a second.
We have breaking news!

07:17.962 --> 07:19.771
<i> There's been a murder</i>
<i> on the high seas.</i>

07:19.923 --> 07:21.422
<i> A local woman is presumed dead</i>

07:21.483 --> 07:23.442
<i> after going overboard</i>
<i> on a cruise ship.</i>

07:23.635 --> 07:26.093
A woman disappears
from a cruise.

07:26.155 --> 07:27.762
I wonder who did it.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.673
Could it be...

07:29.733 --> 07:32.617
BOTH:
The husband or boyfriend?
Mm-hmm.

07:32.810 --> 07:34.995
That's the lady
Grampa was kissing.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.048
Grampa's the husband
or boyfriend?

07:39.050 --> 07:41.367

woman is retired starlet

07:41.462 --> 07:43.353

<i> has been detained</i>
<i> for questioning.</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:48.967
Grampa? A killer?

07:49.160 --> 07:50.694
He doesn't have
that kind of follow-through.

07:50.754 --> 07:54.288
Did Abe Simpson do it?
No one can say for sure.

07:54.349 --> 07:58.477
But this story has the makings
of a hit crime podcast.

unbiased look on<i> Guilty Grampa.</i>

08:09.323 --> 08:11.548
This is horrible.
What are we gonna do?

08:11.650 --> 08:14.701
-I've already subscribed.
-(gasps)

08:19.500 --> 08:22.334
A romantic sunset cruise,
the perfect setting

08:22.485 --> 08:24.336
for new love between
a fading Hollywood actress

08:24.529 --> 08:26.654
and a fully faded old man.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.750
But only one of them
would return to port alive.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.994
-(theme music playing)
-I'm Kent Brockman,

09:05.570 --> 09:07.453
I have with me a woman
who was on that fatal cruise,

09:07.589 --> 09:09.773
disgraced docent Agnes Skinner.

09:09.833 --> 09:11.775
Uh, tell me about that night.

09:11.793 --> 09:15.870
I was at the buffet when I heard
a woman scream, "Abe, don't!"

09:15.931 --> 09:17.781
Then a splash.

09:17.841 --> 09:19.373
What did you do next?

09:19.393 --> 09:20.950
I saw they were refilling
the shrimp tower,

09:20.969 --> 09:23.061
so I had to get over there
and touch them all.

09:23.254 --> 09:24.563
"Abe, don't."

09:24.756 --> 09:27.957
Whatever could
Vivienne have meant by that?

09:27.976 --> 09:30.068
Naturally, the police
questioned Abe Simpson.

09:30.261 --> 09:33.646
His only defense?
"I don't remember."

09:33.740 --> 09:37.300
The old man would not confess.
Rude.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.802
So we swabbed his hands

09:38.862 --> 09:41.487
to see if they tested positive
for pushing.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.899
It came back as "no such test."

09:44.960 --> 09:47.586

Vivienne and I went on
the cruise, had dinner,

10:14.230 --> 10:17.173
drinks, dancing, drinks.

10:17.233 --> 10:19.359
The rest is kind of a blur.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.678
And the next thing I know,
the cops are telling me

10:21.738 --> 10:25.014
-I'm a person of interest.
-That's ridiculous.

10:25.033 --> 10:28.868

interest-- not for one second.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.111

and now she's gone forever.

10:45.370 --> 10:46.552
Now, on the count of three,

10:46.705 --> 10:48.980

he's guilty or not.

10:49.132 --> 10:50.890
One, two, three.

10:51.042 --> 10:52.800
-Not guilty!
-If I'm being honest,
I think he's capable

10:52.819 --> 10:55.211
of anything,
up to and including murder.

"Finely-tuned machine."

and waited for you
to meet me in Mexico

20:03.394 --> 20:04.851
with the insurance money.

20:04.913 --> 20:08.264
That's why I yelled,
"Abe, don't... forget the plan,"

20:08.282 --> 20:11.024
-as I was diving off the boat.
-What boat?

20:11.085 --> 20:14.286
I love you,
you senile old sex machine.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.956
Oh, what do we do now
that we're on the run?

20:17.050 --> 20:19.032
We live out the rest of our days

20:19.093 --> 20:21.868
in a place where no one
will ever notice us.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.180
-(snoring)
-(gentle music playing)

20:31.514 --> 20:34.807
GRAMPA: I'm putting
the space heater on ten.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.734
VIVIENNE:
Ooh, Abe.

20:36.885 --> 20:38.986
Oh, you naughty boy.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.716
