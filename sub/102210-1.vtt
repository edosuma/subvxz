03:21.978 --> 03:23.511
Darnell, what?

I moved out of town,

03:42.265 --> 03:43.431
Tracey had the chance to go,

03:43.465 --> 03:45.101
but my mum insisted
on her staying,

03:45.134 --> 03:49.038

day to do what I had to do,

03:49.071 --> 03:52.275
'cause I cannot stand
that punk ass Darnell.

03:52.308 --> 03:54.509
The thing he did to my sister,

03:55.510 --> 03:58.647
so that pretty much
explains why I'm back.

03:58.681 --> 03:59.916
Okay, that makes two of us.

But I heard he got a
court date coming up,

17:27.857 --> 17:31.027
Now and what the fuck you mean

17:34.997 --> 17:36.099

17:40.803 --> 17:42.972

18:06.696 --> 18:07.797
I hope Charles

18:07.830 --> 18:09.564

hands on me, Darnell.

18:09.598 --> 18:13.136
Charles

18:24.881 --> 18:26.448

18:28.583 --> 18:29.786
this is why I didn't tell you.

18:29.819 --> 18:31.353

18:31.386 --> 18:33.990
But it's crazy, I just saw

18:34.023 --> 18:36.159

18:41.831 --> 18:43.966

18:44.000 --> 18:45.134
Not just open.

18:45.168 --> 18:49.138
Damn, the street was

Niggas, they move on,

18:51.040 --> 18:52.175

18:52.208 --> 18:54.710
Look we're gonna have
to stay out of his way.

18:54.744 --> 18:57.013
'Cause I know he gonna
try some revenge shit

18:57.046 --> 18:58.047
after what happened.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.347
Come on wait, wait,

18:59.381 --> 19:00.082

19:00.116 --> 19:01.217

19:01.250 --> 19:02.785
I mean don't they
mean something to him?

19:02.819 --> 19:05.453
Zak, that shit don't
mean a damn thing.

19:05.487 --> 19:07.223
You see what he
did to my sister.

19:07.256 --> 19:08.991
- He's own damn daughter.
- Yeah.

19:09.025 --> 19:11.227
And look when I saw him

19:13.095 --> 19:14.462
and he was looking for y'all,

19:14.496 --> 19:17.332
and how he gonna start taking
over and all that shit so.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.533
Taking over?

19:18.567 --> 19:19.969
Whatever, he gonna have
to deal with Charles

19:20.002 --> 19:23.272
about that 'cause Charles
took over the streets.

19:23.306 --> 19:25.908
Man, we gonna need some
fighting ass niggas, man.

19:25.942 --> 19:28.510
They can handle
their own damn battle,

19:28.543 --> 19:30.980

nothing to do with me.

19:31.013 --> 19:33.548
But look I got somebody to do,

20:08.050 --> 20:10.385
but he did ask about you though.

20:12.288 --> 20:15.091

24:55.137 --> 24:56.772

30:32.976 --> 30:34.042
Just a little
business that's all.

30:34.076 --> 30:35.644
A few secret things.

30:35.678 --> 30:37.914
Look, y'all can get that

30:42.484 --> 30:43.953
What am I suppose,

30:43.987 --> 30:45.722
Hm, you think so?

30:47.523 --> 30:48.825
I don't know what

30:55.531 --> 30:58.333
Come on, let's

31:12.916 --> 31:14.416
Babe, open up.

31:24.027 --> 31:25.327
Where have you been?

31:26.194 --> 31:28.196
What's in the case?

31:28.230 --> 31:31.166
Why are you asking me
so many goddamn questions?

31:31.199 --> 31:32.601
And plus I need the key.

31:33.302 --> 31:34.202
Don't worry about it,

31:34.236 --> 31:36.071
I got a key made for you today.

31:36.104 --> 31:37.472
Very cool, cool.

31:37.506 --> 31:39.842
I need to get my shit together,

31:39.876 --> 31:41.711
so shit about to go down.

31:41.744 --> 31:43.111
What have you done now?

31:44.047 --> 31:45.782
Noting, it aint your concern.

31:45.815 --> 31:48.150
I just got a little mixed up
with something that's all.

31:48.183 --> 31:50.920
Look baby, I don't
want you in jail again.

31:50.954 --> 31:52.822
You're already on probation.

31:52.855 --> 31:55.223
Don't you think I know that?

31:56.425 --> 31:59.361
Look baby, I'm not
going back to jail.

31:59.394 --> 32:01.731
I'm gonna be here with you,

32:02.664 --> 32:04.266
with your fine ass.

32:05.267 --> 32:06.903
How am I supposed
to know that's true?

32:18.047 --> 32:19.214
I gotta do a little something,

32:19.247 --> 32:22.317
but I gotta tell
you something first.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.188
What is it?

32:26.221 --> 32:28.825
I have a daughter.

32:28.858 --> 32:30.125
A daughter.

32:31.027 --> 32:33.228
Yeah, a long time ago.

32:35.163 --> 32:37.432
I hooked up with Debra.

32:37.466 --> 32:41.904
So
you were together?

32:43.171 --> 32:47.609
Anyway she got pregnant
then she kicked me out,

32:48.610 --> 32:50.947
but she didn't tell
me she was pregnant,

32:50.980 --> 32:52.147
and I never knew
I had a daughter

32:52.180 --> 32:54.282
till the girl was
like seven years old.

32:55.752 --> 32:59.756
So I'm try to tear
her out of her father.

33:00.622 --> 33:02.257
I became her friend.

33:04.794 --> 33:09.164
Her friend, the neighborhood
drug dealer, Darnell.

33:10.666 --> 33:12.902
But I did something I
shouldn't have done.

33:14.236 --> 33:18.841
Sold her drugs and
got her addicted.

33:18.875 --> 33:22.310
And anyway her and her
friends came after me,

33:23.311 --> 33:25.347
and I was trying to
be the big man on top.

33:25.380 --> 33:30.585
So came up with a plan,
kill the pimp, framed them,

33:32.121 --> 33:35.390
and it was all going
good until it backfire.

33:37.492 --> 33:40.328
I got shot, went to jail.

33:42.999 --> 33:47.870
So then her mom, they left town.

33:50.439 --> 33:54.177
Me, I tried to make
amends with her sister,

33:54.209 --> 33:55.078
but she wasn't happy,

33:55.111 --> 33:57.412
so it is what it is.

33:58.447 --> 34:01.483
As long as they gone
they'll be all right.

34:01.516 --> 34:02.350
Yeah.

34:06.756 --> 34:09.992
I'm telling you all this
because I care about you.

34:10.026 --> 34:11.961
You mean a lot to me.

34:13.863 --> 34:16.231
Well, I'm glad you
told me all of this.

34:16.264 --> 34:17.967
I mean it's a lot.

35:05.782 --> 35:06.581
Damn!

35:06.615 --> 35:07.449
Man!

35:10.452 --> 35:12.722
Man, get off her pussy.

35:14.157 --> 35:15.390
Tracey.

35:15.423 --> 35:17.226
What the fuck are you
doing in my goddamn house?

35:17.260 --> 35:18.493
Shut up!

35:18.527 --> 35:19.695
You son of bitch who
would have forced you.

35:19.729 --> 35:20.963
You shut up, who's
talking to you?

35:22.098 --> 35:24.566
This aint got nothing
to do with you.

35:24.599 --> 35:26.169
You got five
motherfucking seconds

35:26.202 --> 35:28.204
to get the fuck out
of my goddamn house?

35:35.343 --> 35:38.380
Darnell.

35:47.389 --> 35:48.691
Are you okay?

35:50.693 --> 35:52.195
What's wrong?

35:52.228 --> 35:55.430
I'm fine.

35:56.866 --> 35:58.167
Go to sleep.

36:18.154 --> 36:20.422

38:18.274 --> 38:20.076

38:54.377 --> 38:55.811
That's none of your business.

38:55.845 --> 38:58.047
This is not your
property no more.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.482
What you mean this

You're lucky I don't tell Darnell
where your punk ass is at.

39:14.930 --> 39:16.966

39:16.999 --> 39:19.068

1:04:41.056 --> 1:04:42.992
Oh, you mean you and Zak?

1:04:43.026 --> 1:04:44.861

1:05:25.034 --> 1:05:26.268

Holy shit, just

1:05:31.173 --> 1:05:33.442

"I'm on my way home."

1:05:35.078 --> 1:05:36.178

Detectives, how y'all doing?

1:09:33.950 --> 1:09:35.617

1:09:52.768 --> 1:09:54.804
Personally, why
are you so defensive.

1:09:54.837 --> 1:09:56.272
I'm not defensive.

1:09:56.305 --> 1:09:57.940
I'm just saying that we're

1:10:06.182 --> 1:10:07.649
Okay, I mean, were you

1:10:10.418 --> 1:10:11.854

1:10:11.888 --> 1:10:14.223
I mean, okay, yeah,

1:10:14.257 --> 1:10:16.259
but I was getting
some money from him.

1:10:16.292 --> 1:10:17.994
I've let him borrow some
money for the prison,

1:10:18.027 --> 1:10:20.329
so he was paying me
back that's was it.

1:10:20.363 --> 1:10:21.396
Nope, that's all.

1:10:21.429 --> 1:10:22.732
And you let this
man borrow money.

1:10:22.765 --> 1:10:24.166
I'll admit it, if
you wanted some money

1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:25.234
I'll let you borrow some money.

1:10:25.268 --> 1:10:26.568
You need some money to borrow?

1:10:42.118 --> 1:10:45.321

you for a second.

1:37:21.149 --> 1:37:23.853
Hey, I saw you hanging

1:37:23.887 --> 1:37:25.354

1:37:32.896 --> 1:37:33.796

1:37:33.830 --> 1:37:35.631
Now you know.

1:37:49.979 --> 1:37:51.814
So long Darnell, so long.
