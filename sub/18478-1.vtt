00:50.948 --> 00:54.876
- Stay wide. Stay wide.
- Audio. Wherefore art thou, audio?

00:54.976 --> 00:56.795
New York, sending bars and tone.

00:57.486 --> 01:00.548
- Dave, when is she gonna be here?
- When?

01:00.648 --> 01:04.260
- Don't look at me. I don't know.
- In our lifetime would be nice.

01:04.361 --> 01:08.556
This is Houston Control. I'd like an ETA
on the royal personage Dixie.

01:08.656 --> 01:12.727
- And what about Eddie?
- Eddie's been here since last Wednesday.

01:12.827 --> 01:14.938
Yeah, in make-up.

01:15.038 --> 01:17.107
- They're calling the kid.
- What kid?

01:17.207 --> 01:20.794
- Jeff, Stan's assistant. He's picking her up.
- Terrific.

01:36.810 --> 01:40.433
- Y'ello.
- Jeff, how you doing? How's she look?

01:41.981 --> 01:44.884
- I'll tell you in two minutes.
- You're not there yet?

01:44.984 --> 01:48.054
- Just pulling up.
- We have camera warm-up at six.

01:48.154 --> 01:51.433
I want her here at 4.30 sharp
and that doesn't mean 4.31.

01:51.533 --> 01:55.353
- No problem.
- This lady eats kids like you for breakfast.

01:55.453 --> 01:58.815
Stanley, relax. I got it covered.

01:58.915 --> 02:01.860
4,30 in make-up or it's your ass,

02:01.960 --> 02:05.049
All right. Mazel ciao, babe.

02:06.923 --> 02:10.344
Jesus Christ! Get that light off me!
You're gonna blind me!

02:16.850 --> 02:20.545
Excuse me. Miss Leonard's apartment?

02:20.645 --> 02:23.437
- Number 10 over there.
- Thanks.

02:32.490 --> 02:34.571
Miss Leonard.

02:42.542 --> 02:44.623
Miss Leonard.

02:55.221 --> 02:57.302
Hello?

03:19.663 --> 03:21.494
Miss Leonard?

03:32.217 --> 03:34.298
Miss Leonard.

04:14.175 --> 04:16.255
Who the hell are you?

04:17.470 --> 04:19.551
- Miss Leonard.
- Uh-uh.

04:21.766 --> 04:25.472
I'm Miss Leonard. You care to try again?

04:26.980 --> 04:29.090
Jeff Brooks.

04:29.190 --> 04:31.568
The awards dinner.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.931
You and Eddie Sparks.

04:36.031 --> 04:39.142
- I ain't going.
- Excuse me?

04:39.242 --> 04:42.145
- I ain't getting on a stage with Eddie Sparks.
- Why not?

04:42.245 --> 04:45.523
Because Eddie Sparks is
a goddamn son of a bitch, that's why.

04:45.623 --> 04:50.153
Miss Leonard, you're the guests of honour.
It's you and Eddie.

04:50.253 --> 04:52.796
You accepted six months ago.

04:53.798 --> 04:57.202
It's the President's Medal,
the president of the United States.

04:57.302 --> 05:01.831
- I never voted for him.
- They've got a live satellite feed.

05:01.931 --> 05:05.168
It's 50 million people.
I don't understand.

05:05.268 --> 05:09.130
Then let me explain it. Fuck
the 50 million people and fuck Eddie Sparks.

05:09.230 --> 05:12.735
- You wanna hear it in French?
- No.

05:13.651 --> 05:15.303
What's so funny?

05:15.403 --> 05:19.599
I was just thinking I can't wait to be old
so I can talk to people like that.

05:19.699 --> 05:22.978
- A clever one.
- Clever enough to fix this record player.

05:23.078 --> 05:24.312
Oh, yeah?

05:24.412 --> 05:30.752
My mother always said these hands
could mend anything but a broken heart.

05:31.461 --> 05:34.072
OK, genius. You got two minutes.

05:34.172 --> 05:38.410
But don't get too comfy, all right?
You're in on a pass.

05:38.510 --> 05:40.591
Yes, ma'am.

05:56.111 --> 06:00.694
It's none of my business,
but you think you oughta be smoking?

06:01.908 --> 06:04.784
Honey, I shouldn't even be breathing.

06:10.917 --> 06:12.297
Oh.

06:12.711 --> 06:14.792
That's the problem.

06:16.798 --> 06:19.424
There we go.

06:21.302 --> 06:24.998
- May I hear the record?
- I ain't going to that cockamamie dinner.

06:25.098 --> 06:27.511
So you can drop the charming act.

06:28.268 --> 06:30.349
Yes, ma'am.

06:32.355 --> 06:36.144
1942. The big one.
It was the war, right?

06:37.402 --> 06:41.618
Yeah, the war. Everybody's big break.

07:47.305 --> 07:51.376
Dixie, there's a shortage of acetate.
We're running out of blanks.

07:51.476 --> 07:56.172
I'm sorry. I just... I was just wondering
what was going on in there.

07:56.272 --> 07:59.611
There's a message for you, Dixie.

08:07.409 --> 08:09.769
- Dixie Leonard.
- Mrs Michael Leonard?

08:09.869 --> 08:11.646
Yes, sir.

08:11.746 --> 08:16.330
- War Department cable. Sign here, please.
- No, I can't. Milt, you...

08:23.299 --> 08:25.493
- Danny, come here.
- What's wrong, Mommy?

08:25.593 --> 08:28.538
- Please, honey, just come here.
- Come on, Dix, relax.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.749
- Let's not have a...
- What?

08:30.849 --> 08:32.929
You know.

08:35.562 --> 08:39.591
"To Dixie Leonard." Blah, blah, blah.
"From Headquarters Special Services,

08:39.691 --> 08:43.470
US Army, Windsor Court Hotel, London."

08:43.570 --> 08:49.726
"You're a poopsie. Have gone out on
enormous limb to convince Eddie Sparks

08:49.826 --> 08:54.356
you are ideal replacement for sick
June Davis for big Christmas tour."

08:54.456 --> 09:00.111
"Drop everything. Bring one sweater,
two pastrami sandwiches, all your charts."

09:00.211 --> 09:02.126
"Love, Uncle Art."

09:03.423 --> 09:06.284
- You're fooling?
- I'm jealous!

09:06.384 --> 09:10.622
- Is it from Daddy?
- No, it's from Uncle Art. Daddy's fine.

09:10.722 --> 09:13.667
- He's fine. Go play.
- Is Uncle Art your fairy godfather?

09:13.767 --> 09:19.381
No. Art Silver, Eddie Sparks' head writer.
I knew they were over there but...

09:19.481 --> 09:23.176
Eddie Sparks, he's so cute.
I got such a thing for him.

09:23.276 --> 09:26.179
- Get in line, honey.
- From what I hear, you have to.

09:26.279 --> 09:32.519
So I leave everything and run over to London
just because Eddie crooks his little finger?

09:34.329 --> 09:37.274
You gonna turn down
a USO tour with Eddie Sparks?

09:37.374 --> 09:39.442
That's a career maker.

09:39.542 --> 09:44.781
Danny, how'd you like to come and spend
a few weeks with your Aunt Corrine?

09:44.881 --> 09:48.827
Do you know how much I love you?
How much?

09:48.927 --> 09:51.849
- How big?
- Bigger than the sky.

09:53.973 --> 09:57.410
You're a guest here,
so you have to pick up after yourself

09:57.510 --> 10:02.007
and you have to eat all your vegetables or
Santa Claus isn't going to give you one thing.

10:02.107 --> 10:04.188
Do you understand?

10:05.235 --> 10:07.945
Are you gonna bring Daddy back?

10:08.947 --> 10:13.184
Well, Daddy's doing such a great job
fighting the bad guys over there,

10:13.284 --> 10:15.395
they need him for a little longer.

10:15.495 --> 10:20.150
You mean when he kills all the Germans,
then he can come home?

10:20.250 --> 10:23.143
Absolutely the same day.

10:24.671 --> 10:26.489
- Sing me.
- Which one?

10:26.589 --> 10:28.670
You know.

10:31.469 --> 10:34.226
<i>There's a place</i>

10:38.893 --> 10:41.588
<i>Way up high</i>

10:41.688 --> 10:46.734
<i>Starry bright there
through the night there</i>

10:47.235 --> 10:50.055
<i>Close your eyes</i>

10:50.155 --> 10:52.974
<i>Let your wishes fly</i>

10:53.074 --> 10:59.356
<i>You'll be in dreamland by and by</i>

11:02.834 --> 11:04.915
They're here.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.119
Eddie! Eddie!

12:04.646 --> 12:06.298
- Let's go.
- Now, Mr Sparks?

12:06.398 --> 12:09.593
No, next Tuesday.
There's gonna be a major riot here.

12:09.693 --> 12:14.556
- We're going in one minute.
- She's late. I told you we shouldn't wait.

12:14.656 --> 12:17.726
Eddie, I didn't make the fog.

12:17.826 --> 12:21.104
Girl singers. God save me
from girl singers.

12:21.204 --> 12:24.232
- Art says she's dynamite.
- Art says?

12:24.332 --> 12:28.361
Art's her goddamn uncle.
What do you expect?

12:28.461 --> 12:31.301
- Where is Art?
- I'll find him.

13:01.828 --> 13:04.834
Dixie! Dixie!

13:07.500 --> 13:09.903
I made it! Hi!

13:10.003 --> 13:13.531
- Oh, God!
- I'm so glad to see you.

13:13.631 --> 13:19.746
- Let me look at you. You look beautiful.
- I didn't think I'd ever get over. Here, here.

13:19.846 --> 13:23.220
- You remembered. Pastrami, you angel.
- I'm beat.

13:24.059 --> 13:26.962
Eddie, I almost forgot.
Art says to open with this.

13:27.062 --> 13:30.882
- Does he?
- The entire bomb group got back. No losses.

13:30.982 --> 13:33.885
- Who do you wanna see?
- Eddie!

13:33.985 --> 13:36.695
- What's his name?
- Eddie!

13:37.489 --> 13:40.475
- Speak up. I can't hear you. Who?
- Eddie!

13:40.575 --> 13:42.822
Oh, him. The cute one.

13:47.123 --> 13:51.043
You requested him.
Now here he is. Eddie Sparks!

14:17.737 --> 14:22.309
The band play on, Eddie does his monologue,
ha-ha-ha-ha, then he intros Vicki.

14:22.409 --> 14:25.687
- Who's Vicki?
- Dancer, friend of Eddie's, hubba hubba.

14:25.787 --> 14:30.199
Got the picture?
Then Eddie out, intro Dixie.

14:30.215 --> 14:33.403
- Wow. What the heck's that?
- They must have started.

14:33.503 --> 14:37.532
I just got a couple of scores
for you guys here.

14:37.632 --> 14:39.926
Chicago 14, Philadelphia 3.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.686
898th Bomb Group 21...

14:52.313 --> 14:54.276
Germans nothing.

15:01.531 --> 15:05.852
- It sounds like the Army-Navy game.
- You'll get used to it. Try and learn this.

15:05.952 --> 15:08.730
- It's a comedy spot. You and Eddie.
- What?

15:08.830 --> 15:12.150
- Nothing to it.
- I can't do a comedy spot.

15:12.250 --> 15:15.320
It's OK. It'll all be on cards.

15:15.420 --> 15:19.366
Funnies with the girl singer.
It's Eddie's trademark. They expect it.

15:19.466 --> 15:22.494
- What are you gonna sing?
- "Stuff Like That There."

15:22.594 --> 15:26.122
- Is it up?
- It's up. It's bouncy.

15:26.222 --> 15:33.088
Comedy spot, you and Eddie, ha-ha-ha-ha,
then "Stuff Like That There", then applause,

15:33.188 --> 15:37.801
Wally and the band,
then wrap up Eddie, bye-bye.

15:37.901 --> 15:43.765
- So when do we rehearse all this?
- Rehearse? Dixie, this is it.

15:51.331 --> 15:55.110
- Hello, Dixie. Sam Schiff, Eddie's producer.
- Hi.

15:55.210 --> 16:00.240
- He's really excited about your being here.
- That's wonderful. Anything for Eddie.

16:00.340 --> 16:03.785
- Sounds good.
- He could run for prime minister. I'm serious.

16:03.885 --> 16:06.621
- Why not king?
- I was thinking Führer,

16:06.721 --> 16:08.415
I'll see you later.

16:08.515 --> 16:10.792
This bundle of joy is Loretta,

16:10.892 --> 16:14.170
Eddie's other writer,
our wardrobe mistress and my love slave.

16:14.270 --> 16:20.010
Dream on. Hi, Dixie. I'm Loretta.
Nice to meet you. Easy. How you feeling?

16:20.110 --> 16:22.846
Like the Ringling Brothers
were camping in my mouth.

16:22.946 --> 16:27.058
Thank God... a live one. You go on after Little
Bo Peep. Why don't we get you dressed?

16:27.158 --> 16:29.701
Song! Song! Song!

16:30.412 --> 16:35.025
- "Stuff Like That There." Go, go, go.
- Corporal. Band person.

16:35.125 --> 16:38.570
D flat, not E flat. He didn't hear me.

16:38.670 --> 16:40.947
I've been up two days.
How do I sing an E flat?

16:41.047 --> 16:44.659
You could sing in L, they'll love it.
What's the matter? You OK?

16:44.759 --> 16:47.884
I'm fine, I'm fine. England, right?

16:54.144 --> 16:56.504
All right, enough of this.

16:56.604 --> 17:00.773
Now, guys, a little girl
who can make grown men cry...

17:05.655 --> 17:08.349
Our own little bit of lend-lease,

17:08.450 --> 17:10.862
the amazing Miss Victoria Lee.

17:20.420 --> 17:21.884
Hi, boys.

17:47.197 --> 17:49.266
Great.

17:49.366 --> 17:53.700
Sensational. Sensational.
She's here. She's getting dressed.

18:14.307 --> 18:17.502
- Loretta, my hair.
- You look great.

18:17.602 --> 18:20.394
Let's go over these lines again.

18:22.524 --> 18:24.593
- That's him.
- That's him.

18:24.693 --> 18:26.774
He's coming over here.

18:28.780 --> 18:30.223
- Hello. Dixie?
- Yes.

18:30.323 --> 18:35.270
- Hi, I'm Eddie Sparks.
- I can't believe I'm seeing you in person.

18:35.370 --> 18:38.231
They love you so much.
Gosh, you're amazing.

18:38.331 --> 18:40.525
- Just a kid from the Bronx.
- Imagine.

18:40.625 --> 18:43.236
So what are you gonna sing, sweetheart?

18:43.336 --> 18:46.489
- "Stuff Like That There."
- Like...

18:46.589 --> 18:50.243
- I don't know that.
- It's an up song. It's bouncy.

18:50.343 --> 18:54.456
Bouncy's good. So did you ever sing
in front of a real band?

18:54.556 --> 18:57.417
- Did you ever hear of Tommy Dorsey?
- Dorsey? Of course.

18:57.517 --> 19:00.013
Me too. Great band, huh?

19:01.479 --> 19:04.966
That's a joke. Actually,
he did ask me to tour with him once,

19:05.066 --> 19:09.930
but I have a little boy and my husband
is a combat photographer in North Africa...

19:10.030 --> 19:13.558
Are we really gonna do a comedy routine?

19:13.658 --> 19:18.021
Piece of cake. Just read the cue cards and
when in trouble you throw it back to papa.

19:18.121 --> 19:20.000
Yes, sir.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.123
Boy.

19:28.173 --> 19:30.700
That is quite a dress.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.925
Well, this is me in my dress.

19:34.637 --> 19:37.707
- You're gonna be sensational.
- Thank you.

19:37.807 --> 19:40.220
Sam.

19:41.811 --> 19:44.506
- Get me a backup.
- What's up? She looked nervous.

19:44.606 --> 19:47.926
- Nervous? She was like a horse on fire.
- Well?

19:48.026 --> 19:50.107
She's no Greta Garbo.

19:51.363 --> 19:55.141
Sam, could you give us a minute, please?

19:55.241 --> 19:58.687
- Eddie, Steel Pier, Atlantic City, 1931.
- Don't start.

19:58.787 --> 20:01.481
You were wearing the check suit.
I said lose it.

20:01.581 --> 20:07.237
You were doing I don't know what. I said
"We're gonna write you..." Look at me.

20:07.337 --> 20:09.864
Who am I? Come on, Eddie.

20:09.964 --> 20:15.537
The writer. Why do they call them writers?
Cos they're right, right?

20:15.637 --> 20:18.832
You're a smug bastard.
I should have dumped you years ago.

20:18.932 --> 20:22.419
- You still got the check suit?
- Fuck you and your cousin.

20:22.519 --> 20:27.399
Niece. And she's gonna go all the way,
with or without us.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.896
- Damn. Look at this.
- What?

20:53.550 --> 20:58.217
- I think I'm gonna puke.
- No. A couple of deep breaths.

20:59.556 --> 21:01.875
- What is it, butterflies?
- Elephants.

21:01.975 --> 21:04.056
Here, take the edge off.

21:06.104 --> 21:08.185
Better?

21:09.983 --> 21:11.968
- What is that?
- Nazi tank fuel.

21:12.068 --> 21:15.805
Grows hair all over your pinamunda.
I know, I need some rest.

21:15.905 --> 21:19.601
- OK, take a look.
- Oh, Loretta.

21:19.701 --> 21:23.271
- I look human. Thank you. You're a genius.
- You're on next.

21:23.371 --> 21:27.567
- What, now? Oh, God.
- Honey, it's a bunch of horny guys.

21:27.667 --> 21:30.695
- How you gonna lose?
- In that case, let me at 'em.

22:43.952 --> 22:46.313
- Maybe we can pin it.
- It's too far gone.

22:46.413 --> 22:49.274
You're on next. Holy Moses!
What happened?

22:49.374 --> 22:52.444
They're gonna take me outside
and shoot me like a deserter.

22:52.544 --> 22:54.988
Larry! Stretch.

22:55.088 --> 22:59.034
Someone who just flew
over from the States to be with us.

22:59.134 --> 23:03.413
Let's give her a big welcome.
A great, great singer.

23:03.513 --> 23:05.427
Miss Dixie Leonard!

23:17.610 --> 23:19.262
- Guess what.
- What?

23:19.362 --> 23:21.681
She's not ready.

23:21.781 --> 23:23.862
Isn't that like a dame?

23:25.744 --> 23:32.484
If you guys took this long getting dressed,
we'd all be speaking German by now.

23:32.584 --> 23:36.571
- Don't you have another dress?
- Don't you wanna try and help?

23:36.671 --> 23:38.365
- Captain?
- Who, me?

23:38.465 --> 23:41.839
- Yeah, you. Hi.
- Hello.

23:43.970 --> 23:45.767
Hello.

23:46.473 --> 23:51.461
You know, there is one piece of
women's apparel I don't quite understand.

23:51.561 --> 23:54.256
The one with the straps,
the buttons, the hooks.

23:54.356 --> 23:58.358
- It's a brassiere!
- It's harder to get off than a parachute.

23:59.694 --> 24:01.443
That's why I always offer to help.

24:18.672 --> 24:20.420
Well, hi.

24:22.676 --> 24:24.757
Hello.

24:25.512 --> 24:28.540
Thought you'd never get here.

24:28.640 --> 24:33.420
So sorry. Little trouble over
the Channel, you know, old pip.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.360
Really?

24:40.360 --> 24:47.079
Righto. We were halfway to Belgium when
we ran out of "gas", I believe you call it.

24:51.371 --> 24:56.453
That's funny. You don't look like
you'd ever run out of gas.

24:59.796 --> 25:04.200
Are you trying to get
into my flak suit, honey?

25:04.300 --> 25:07.223
I'm just trying to debrief you.

25:18.356 --> 25:22.940
So, a plane without any gas.
What did you do?

25:26.489 --> 25:28.475
Do?

25:28.575 --> 25:32.957
Yeah, do.
To keep up morale and all that.

25:40.837 --> 25:44.908
Well, my copilot, lovely young boy

25:45.008 --> 25:48.828
but terrified half out of his wits,
you know, nervous, terrified.

25:48.928 --> 25:51.498
I said to him

25:51.598 --> 25:58.088
"This one's going to take
a long, hard, pull."

26:12.202 --> 26:14.283
So I did!

26:17.582 --> 26:19.995
For two hours.

26:31.888 --> 26:36.668
Two hours alone with you...
that boy deserves a Purple Heart.

26:36.768 --> 26:41.768
It was purple all right,
but I don't think it was his heart.

26:51.491 --> 26:57.898
I think I've gotta take a cold shower now.
How about a song before we all get arrested?

26:57.998 --> 26:59.858
I'd love to.

26:59.958 --> 27:03.987
Here she is, direct from the convent,

27:04.087 --> 27:07.093
the wonderful Miss Dixie Leonard.

27:11.594 --> 27:16.060
I want her and her mouth
on the next plane outta here.

29:05.959 --> 29:08.486
All right, OK, all right, all right.

29:08.586 --> 29:11.865
So are we being attacked?
I always like to know these things.

29:13.091 --> 29:17.537
- We lost power. Give us a minute or two.
- Why you gotta yell?

29:17.637 --> 29:22.042
Well, alone in the dark
with thousands of men.

29:27.147 --> 29:30.271
There is a god after all.

29:31.109 --> 29:34.483
- Come on, sweetheart. Sing!
- Yeah!

29:37.866 --> 29:43.494
There's only one thing I like to do
in the dark, honey, and it ain't sing.

29:50.962 --> 29:52.960
Oh, my.

30:02.349 --> 30:05.354
Well, if you feel that way about it.

30:06.978 --> 30:09.059
"PS I Love You" in A.

32:56.022 --> 33:00.155
- Is that for me or the guy on the generator?
- You!

33:03.571 --> 33:07.111
I love you. I had the best time.
Thank you.

34:12.181 --> 34:14.042
It was... It was...

34:14.141 --> 34:16.223
Mr Sparks.

34:16.853 --> 34:21.675
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah, honey. You. You're wrong.

34:21.775 --> 34:24.344
You got a toilet for a mouth.
I don't appreciate it.

34:24.444 --> 34:27.472
A lot of these boys are gonna die
and you wanna send them off

34:27.572 --> 34:30.183
with a bunch of cheap-ass
dick jokes, is that it?

34:30.283 --> 34:32.978
- No, sir. I just thought...
- You thought?

34:33.078 --> 34:36.147
If you haven't got the class,
you oughta have the brains.

34:36.246 --> 34:38.149
- OK, Eddie, enough.
- What?

34:38.248 --> 34:42.571
- You made your point.
- There are a lot of writers without nieces.

34:42.670 --> 34:44.752
Eddie.

35:06.820 --> 35:10.599
How about that?
The fabulous Dixie Leonard.

35:10.699 --> 35:12.862
Really nice work, Dixie.

35:14.953 --> 35:18.908
How about a hand
for the very lovely Vicki Lee?

35:20.709 --> 35:26.966
Not to mention my number one man,
Wally Fields and the boys.

35:29.426 --> 35:33.724
Well, that's our show.
I hope you liked it.

36:06.212 --> 36:08.293
You.

36:26.232 --> 36:30.401
- No autographs, fellas.
- Sam, it's all right.

36:31.279 --> 36:33.360
Just a few.

36:35.408 --> 36:39.396
Eddie, that new stuff I put in tonight,
did you like it?

36:39.496 --> 36:41.992
Not now, honey. That's it.

36:43.833 --> 36:46.903
I don't need this.
I've been working in clubs since I'm 16.

36:47.003 --> 36:50.907
Dixie, when I first started with Eddie,
he fired me every day for a week.

36:51.007 --> 36:55.870
- It's a squall. It passes over.
- He's a racehorse. It's a different set of rules.

36:55.970 --> 36:58.707
He knows what happened out there.
He's no fool.

36:58.807 --> 37:03.086
- He's an evil, sadistic son of a bitch.
- He happens to be right about the dick jokes.

37:03.186 --> 37:06.089
He kept setting me up.
What did he expect?

37:06.189 --> 37:10.135
Come on, Dixie.
You panicked and went for the crotch.

37:10.235 --> 37:12.304
We get to the hotel and you apologise.

37:12.404 --> 37:16.308
What did I do? I got a few laughs,
I brought down the house, I topped him.

37:16.408 --> 37:19.811
- You're supposed to.
- We're gonna build the act around that.

37:19.911 --> 37:23.607
- What are you talking about? There's no act.
- No act, huh?

37:23.707 --> 37:26.416
You two are gonna be an industry.

37:46.563 --> 37:49.591
- She sings pretty good. She does funny.
- Yeah.

37:49.691 --> 37:51.772
- Funny is money.
- Yeah.

37:52.861 --> 37:57.807
- Welcome to jolly old life as usual.
- Come on, Wally, let's go get stupid.

37:57.907 --> 38:02.896
- Dixie, honey, I wanna buy you a drink.
- Go with them. I'll be with you in a minute.

38:02.996 --> 38:07.248
We'll be under the bar.
Wake us for the armistice.

38:10.587 --> 38:15.882
Hello, Reg. That's the Dixie Leonard
I was telling you about.

38:36.029 --> 38:38.110
Listen, Eddie.

38:39.866 --> 38:45.105
Me and Dixie just had a long talk.
She feels terrible about what happened.

38:45.205 --> 38:49.457
I think we should just
clean the slate and start over.

38:51.086 --> 38:53.167
Why?

38:55.799 --> 38:57.909
Did you tell him?

38:58.009 --> 39:00.505
- You tell him.
- Tell me what?

39:01.930 --> 39:04.916
The two of you are gonna be bigger
than Burns and Allen.

39:05.016 --> 39:09.600
Bigger than Hope and Crosby.
Bigger than all of 'em.

39:16.152 --> 39:21.391
I got all these advisors. Who's the guy that
goes out and gets the laughs every night?

39:21.491 --> 39:24.060
It's you, Eddie. You are the one.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.980
And that's why
I'm gonna go bring her over.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.941
I wish you wouldn't do that.

39:30.041 --> 39:32.122
Want some aspirin?

39:38.299 --> 39:41.202
- Come on.
- No, I don't think so.

39:41.302 --> 39:45.832
He feels terrible about what happened.
He just needs you to break the ice.

39:45.932 --> 39:48.084
- Go on, Dixie.
- Go ahead.

39:48.184 --> 39:50.680
He's disconsolate. Come on.

39:54.524 --> 39:57.844
What would I have to give you
for one little kiss?

39:57.944 --> 40:00.025
Chloroform.

40:03.700 --> 40:06.955
Eddie, you remember Dixie Leonard.

40:07.787 --> 40:10.330
Yeah, I remember. So...

40:10.832 --> 40:12.913
So...

40:13.835 --> 40:16.129
You have something to say?

40:17.589 --> 40:21.757
Yeah. I don't like
the way you talk to my uncle.

40:22.886 --> 40:24.955
What is your problem, lady?

40:25.055 --> 40:29.209
My problem, Eddie,
is you can't walk all over people.

40:29.309 --> 40:31.670
It makes a bad impression.

40:31.770 --> 40:36.383
- I guess that's what's held me back.
- That's what's held you back as a person.

40:36.483 --> 40:39.427
Oh, God. Right through the heart.

40:39.527 --> 40:41.608
I mean, if I had one.

40:42.489 --> 40:46.184
That's enough. Sit down,
have a drink, for Christ's sakes.

40:46.284 --> 40:49.646
No, I'm gonna get some sleep.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

40:49.746 --> 40:51.827
Dixie.

40:55.669 --> 40:59.339
I give up. What do I have to do?

41:01.341 --> 41:04.347
You could try saying you're sorry.

41:14.354 --> 41:17.276
Apologise. Go fix it.

41:24.155 --> 41:25.820
Let us pray.

41:26.616 --> 41:31.563
- Two-bit Napoleon. I bet you he wears lifts.
- You can't take him personally.

41:31.663 --> 41:35.831
- Him and Hitler have the same agent.
- Good line.

41:37.794 --> 41:41.133
- He's just like all the rest of them.
- Give us a song, Eddie.

42:41.066 --> 42:43.147
I apologise.

42:45.445 --> 42:50.326
- Just relax and follow my lead.
- Yeah, right off a cliff.

43:00.085 --> 43:02.571
You just let me teach you
and nothing'll stop us.

43:02.671 --> 43:08.243
We'll be bigger than Burns and Allen,
bigger than Hope and Crosby.

43:08.343 --> 43:11.265
We'll be bigger than all of them.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.684
OK.

43:21.147 --> 43:24.134
- Oh, my God. What's that?
- It's an air raid.

43:24.234 --> 43:28.555
- What do we do?
- Do? Nothing can happen to you.

43:28.655 --> 43:30.949
You're with Eddie Sparks.

43:43.420 --> 43:45.989
And he was right,

43:46.089 --> 43:50.388
You could feel it, He was invincible,

43:51.720 --> 43:55.999
Nothing could happen to you
if you were with Eddie Sparks.

43:56.099 --> 43:58.180
He just had magic.

44:00.311 --> 44:03.899
And how they loved him, those boys.

44:05.900 --> 44:08.511
Airfields,

44:08.611 --> 44:10.692
camps,

44:11.823 --> 44:13.287
hospitals.

44:14.242 --> 44:16.121
He was something.

44:17.620 --> 44:19.701
Generous...

44:20.332 --> 44:22.413
stingy...

44:24.002 --> 44:25.631
infuriating...

44:27.130 --> 44:29.211
brilliant.

44:31.384 --> 44:35.932
A world-class,
solid-gold son of a bitch.

44:44.314 --> 44:46.758
Liked the ladies, did he?

44:46.858 --> 44:51.471
He screwed everything that moved,
between Portsmouth and Yokohama.

44:51.571 --> 44:52.607
Really?

44:54.616 --> 44:57.310
No, honey, not me.

44:57.410 --> 44:59.396
I was married.

44:59.496 --> 45:04.234
Back then you... you didn't do it
with someone else if you were married.

45:04.334 --> 45:07.423
Yeah, I think I read
something about that.

45:12.217 --> 45:15.258
Who was he? Your husband.

45:21.434 --> 45:22.898
Michael.

45:29.025 --> 45:32.325
Five, six, seven, eight...

45:34.781 --> 45:36.862
- And duck.
- Oh, gosh.

45:39.577 --> 45:43.148
- Am I too far?
- Algeria's better than Palm Beach.

45:43.248 --> 45:45.942
You get a better class
of scorpion in your tent.

45:46.042 --> 45:48.538
I was nowhere near your tent.

45:50.213 --> 45:53.491
- How about that desert sun, Dix?
- What's the line?

45:53.591 --> 45:55.827
- My sunburn got a sunburn.
- I hate that.

45:55.927 --> 45:58.496
Would you mind awfully
if I worked on it with Art?

45:58.596 --> 46:02.267
- Not awfully.
- Eddie. Eddie.

46:02.851 --> 46:04.932
Why don't we take five?

46:07.063 --> 46:13.720
The sun was so hot that I saw a Nazi pilot
putting nose cream on his Messerschmitt.

46:13.820 --> 46:15.430
- They found him.
- Great.

46:15.530 --> 46:19.726
Sergeant Michael Leonard,
combat photographer, attached to 3rd Army.

46:19.826 --> 46:21.937
- That's him.
- Had to pull some strings.

46:22.037 --> 46:26.066
- He'll be here at 1630 hours.
- What does he know?

46:26.166 --> 46:30.612
- Just to show up.
- I tell you what, I owe you one, pal.

46:30.712 --> 46:32.572
Wait, wait, wait.

46:32.672 --> 46:34.991
Here you go.

46:35.091 --> 46:36.493
Thank you.

46:36.593 --> 46:40.497
I'd like to introduce you to the only
two-star bachelor in North Africa.

46:40.597 --> 46:43.333
- And a very big fan of yours.
- Hi.

46:43.433 --> 46:45.585
Indeed, ma'am. Indeed.

46:45.685 --> 46:49.422
Did you ever see the inside
of a general's command tent?

46:49.522 --> 46:53.821
- No. Am I gonna?
- She's such a kidder. Go on.

46:55.028 --> 46:58.598
So tell me, General,
how did you get all those stars?

46:58.698 --> 47:01.490
Well, you gotta earn 'em, honey.

47:04.663 --> 47:07.482
Wait. You only got two cameras?

47:07.582 --> 47:11.486
I got two cameras on the platform.
I got a handheld over here.

47:11.586 --> 47:14.114
- Listen...
- What's the matter with you?

47:14.214 --> 47:16.908
Why don't we tell her?

47:17.008 --> 47:19.661
Are you nuts?
I want those first reactions on film.

47:19.761 --> 47:21.871
The real thing, no acting.

47:21.971 --> 47:26.042
She sees him, he sees her,
they run, they embrace, they kiss.

47:26.142 --> 47:28.336
You gotta be kidding me.
That's dynamite.

47:28.436 --> 47:33.649
It's a million dollars' worth
of publicity, Sam. A million. Please.

47:38.613 --> 47:40.098
Code three.

47:40.198 --> 47:42.350
Algeria's a better place
than Palm Beach.

47:42.450 --> 47:46.156
You get a much better class
of scorpion in your shorts.

48:02.595 --> 48:06.207
- How about that desert sun, Dix?
- It's just terrible,

48:06.307 --> 48:12.565
The other day I saw a Nazi pilot
putting nose cream on his Messerschmitt,

48:13.606 --> 48:15.687
Dixie?

48:16.735 --> 48:18.178
He's on his way down.

48:18.278 --> 48:23.558
It's a pleasure working with someone
who can make General Patton blush.

48:23.658 --> 48:27.187
- Sergeant Leonard, Sam Schiff.
- That's my wife.

48:27.287 --> 48:30.315
Eddie Sparks'... producer.

48:30.415 --> 48:34.797
- Code three, code three.
- OK, fellas. Code three.

48:58.818 --> 49:02.572
Dixie, it's me! Michael!

49:03.239 --> 49:05.617
Dixie, it's Michael!

49:06.242 --> 49:10.021
It's me! It's me, Michael!

49:10.121 --> 49:15.251
- Oh, my God. My God, it's Michael.
- Merry Christmas.

49:17.921 --> 49:21.533
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a little surprise.

49:21.633 --> 49:27.163
A certain sergeant
who hasn't seen his wife in a year.

49:30.016 --> 49:31.978
Come and get her, Mike!

50:08.221 --> 50:11.975
Hey, sarge.
Hey, sarge, break it up here.

50:16.229 --> 50:21.311
Sarge, for some reason
I get the feeling she might like you.

50:22.569 --> 50:25.279
I'm a pretty great guy.

50:34.998 --> 50:39.486
People ask me "Eddie, why do you do it?"

50:39.586 --> 50:41.667
Why?

50:44.049 --> 50:46.952
They say "You could be back
in the States

50:47.052 --> 50:51.998
with your lovely wife,
beautiful three daughters."

50:52.098 --> 50:57.228
They too understand
that we're here for moments like this.

51:00.857 --> 51:06.781
That's why we're here.
Whenever freedom's at stake, we'll be there.

51:14.704 --> 51:18.209
Sing him a song, honey. He's earned it.

54:17.887 --> 54:23.293
This is presented on behalf of the president
of the United States and a grateful nation.

54:23.393 --> 54:25.474
Thank you.

55:18.948 --> 55:22.018
Do you wanna come with me?
What do you say?

55:22.118 --> 55:24.199
Come on.

55:37.676 --> 55:40.579
- That son of ours is really something.
- What happened?

55:40.679 --> 55:44.207
Last night I'm tucking him in bed.
He says "Is kissing dirty?"

55:44.307 --> 55:47.168
- What'd you tell him?
- Only if you do it right.

55:47.268 --> 55:51.715
Hold it. Dixie, the line is
"Only if you don't brush your teeth."

55:51.815 --> 55:55.844
- Yeah, but my line's funny.
- Here we go again. What do you wanna do?

55:55.944 --> 55:58.972
She can't say that. She can't say it.

55:59.072 --> 56:01.433
You wrote the line. You tell her.

56:01.533 --> 56:05.687
- Censor says no, Dixie.
- Screw the censor. Maybe that's the answer.

56:05.787 --> 56:11.026
What do you say, Jack?
Four o'clock, Hotel Edison, Room 809?

56:11.126 --> 56:14.416
Let's everybody take five, OK?

56:15.171 --> 56:17.991
Dixie, it's me, for Christ's sakes.

56:18.091 --> 56:21.036
Leave me alone, Eddie.
I don't wanna talk about it.

56:21.136 --> 56:24.456
- What are you gonna do? The way he says?
- Yeah.

56:24.556 --> 56:28.393
- Harold, take a hike, will you?
- It's Danny.

56:31.021 --> 56:34.299
He's cutting school,
he doesn't come home at night.

56:34.399 --> 56:38.762
- He's 12 years old. He's growing up.
- Eddie, stop. Just stop.

56:38.862 --> 56:41.571
Dixie, Eddie, look who's here,

56:42.657 --> 56:48.521
Oh, my God. Eddie, look. In the fish tank.
It's... the sponsors!

56:48.621 --> 56:51.117
Gentlemen, may I say...

56:53.084 --> 56:57.072
your coffee, I can't live without it,
because it's not just coffee.

56:57.172 --> 57:01.243
It's nectar, it's ambrosia,
it's really like a drug, isn't it?

57:01.343 --> 57:07.600
You probably do put a little narcotic in it,
I've gotta have that coffee!

57:08.975 --> 57:12.295
Sorry, Dixie. We're out of time.
Everybody be back in 30 for air.

57:12.395 --> 57:15.235
Eddie, your wife and daughters
are in the greenroom.

57:24.074 --> 57:26.996
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:31.039 --> 57:36.278
- Mummy, may I have a pretzel, please?
- No, darling. You'll spoil your appetite.

57:36.378 --> 57:39.917
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, my angel.

57:40.590 --> 57:43.300
- Hi, Daddy.
- Sweetheart.

57:44.386 --> 57:47.497
So, how was traffic?

57:47.597 --> 57:49.808
None to speak of.

57:50.975 --> 57:55.088
Well, I guess I gotta get dressed,
so I'll see you after the show. Girls.

57:55.188 --> 57:56.901
- Good luck.
- Bye, Daddy.

57:58.274 --> 58:01.428
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Eddie. Hi, girls. Want a pretzel?

58:01.528 --> 58:04.639
What is this? Danny Leonard in a tie?
Somebody died?

58:04.739 --> 58:11.079
- My mom wants me to dress up for the show.
- Let's go find her. See you later.

58:16.751 --> 58:19.154
Sh. Oh.

58:19.254 --> 58:21.615
Wait, wait, wait.

58:21.715 --> 58:24.211
How about that?

58:24.884 --> 58:29.468
Which one would you want,
the blonde or the brunette?

58:32.308 --> 58:34.390
- The blonde.
- No.

58:35.812 --> 58:38.298
The brunette? How come?

58:38.398 --> 58:41.320
How come, my boy? Brunettes...

58:42.152 --> 58:44.233
are wilder.

58:45.864 --> 58:47.432
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Eddie.

58:47.532 --> 58:50.060
- Hi.
- Hi, cutie.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.241
We gotta go. See you.

58:53.538 --> 58:57.078
Contortionists. Never mind.

58:58.668 --> 59:01.821
Absolutely perfect.

59:01.921 --> 59:04.532
- Merrill, who am I supposed to be?
- Scheherazade.

59:04.632 --> 59:07.683
I look like Sabu on a bad night.

59:09.095 --> 59:12.999
- Hey, Ma. Neat costume.
- Merrill, do something with this.

59:13.099 --> 59:15.180
I wanna talk to you.

59:20.732 --> 59:22.813
Come here.

59:23.568 --> 59:26.278
I'd like you to read something.

59:29.657 --> 59:31.739
Go ahead. Read it.

59:34.412 --> 59:37.732
"Dear Dr Rich. Please excuse
Danny from school tomorrow

59:37.832 --> 59:41.736
as he has to visit
his aunt in Connecticut."

59:41.836 --> 59:46.157
Signed Dixie Leonard.
Very good, the Connecticut detail.

59:46.257 --> 59:49.911
Gives it real authenticity,
only Connecticut is spelled with two Ns.

59:50.011 --> 59:55.166
How about this one? "To visit his father's
grave in Washington DC." How could you?

59:55.266 --> 59:57.294
- And this one!
- Miss Leonard...

59:57.394 --> 59:59.462
- Get out!
- You're needed on the floor.

59:59.562 --> 01:00:01.643
Listen to me.

01:00:07.195 --> 01:00:11.992
So you cut school. All right.
What do you do all day?

01:00:13.618 --> 01:00:16.229
I'm asking you a question.
What do you do?

01:00:16.329 --> 01:00:22.068
Do you walk the streets? Do you go
to the movies? Is this with other kids?

01:00:22.168 --> 01:00:25.488
Please. You talk to me.
I'm asking you a question.

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:28.366
I don't know, all right?

01:00:28.466 --> 01:00:32.746
It's like you said, OK? Me and some guys,
we go to the movies or hang out.

01:00:32.846 --> 01:00:36.082
You sound like a bunch of guys
in an old-age home.

01:00:36.182 --> 01:00:39.307
Do you really hate school that much?

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:42.672
- But you gotta go.
- Why?

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:47.302
Because it's the law. Because I say so.
Because your father wanted you to.

01:00:47.402 --> 01:00:49.679
What the hell kind of question is that?

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:54.476
- Uncle Eddie never went past the fifth grade.
- Uncle Eddie isn't an example of anything.

01:00:54.576 --> 01:00:56.408
Dixie, for God's sake... places!

01:00:57.203 --> 01:01:04.374
And now it's time for The Bailey's Comedy
Hour with Eddie Sparks and Dixie Leonard.

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:10.659
Brought to you by Bailey's Foods,

01:01:10.759 --> 01:01:14.663
makers of Bailey's coffee
and other fine products for your table.

01:01:14.763 --> 01:01:17.249
Hold four. Here we go. Take one.

01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:20.293
Watch it. Stay with it,
stay with it. Take it.

01:01:20.393 --> 01:01:25.819
Loretta DeChecko, Jesse Sparks
and Wally Fields and the band!

01:01:27.942 --> 01:01:33.487
And now here they are,
the Whirling Jepper Clayton Dancers!

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:51.091
We're on two. Three, go to 90.
Take three.

01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:02.168
Move in, two. I can't hear the rhythm.
Get the rhythm up.

01:02:02.268 --> 01:02:04.349
Go, four.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:16.454
Dolly around, three. Right... take four.

01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:28.904
Listen, I really want you
to lay off Danny. I'm serious.

01:02:29.004 --> 01:02:32.532
- What do you mean?
- All this fake man-to-man bullshit.

01:02:32.632 --> 01:02:34.951
- It's not bullshit.
- Yes, it is.

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:37.621
He's 13 years old,
not one of your poker buddies.

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:40.749
- You're smothering him.
- You fill his head full of crap.

01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:44.127
- Such as what?
- Don't study, life's a big party...

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:46.805
- Sounds good to me.
- Oh, yeah?

01:02:47.814 --> 01:02:50.842
You got three daughters.
Give them your wisdom.

01:02:50.942 --> 01:02:55.138
- My wisdom is for a son.
- Don't break my heart.

01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:57.766
How long's it been?
Eight years Michael's dead?

01:02:57.866 --> 01:03:02.331
- You shut up.
- No. You let me talk. Enough is enough.

01:03:03.538 --> 01:03:06.983
The boy needs a father, a man in his life,
someone he can talk to.

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:10.320
- Somebody who can teach him.
- How to screw the chorus girls?

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.198
Why not, if he wants to? Get off me!

01:03:13.298 --> 01:03:18.119
Why not? That's life. I wish somebody was
there to teach me how to kiss 'em, talk to 'em.

01:03:18.219 --> 01:03:20.747
- How to jack off.
- What did you say?

01:03:20.847 --> 01:03:24.292
Who's gonna tell him
his thing won't fall off? His mother?

01:03:24.392 --> 01:03:29.736
- Why don't you put a dress on him?
- You'd probably make a pass at him!

01:03:35.236 --> 01:03:37.946
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:42.030
the stars of our show...

01:03:43.036 --> 01:03:45.105
everybody's lovebirds...

01:03:45.205 --> 01:03:47.857
Stay with it, stay with it. Cue 'em on.

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:53.502
..chic-est couple,
Eddie Sparks and Dixie Leonard!

01:04:21.199 --> 01:04:23.825
Take it. Why don't you write
funny stuff like that?

01:04:25.412 --> 01:04:29.816
You know, medical research has shown
that a rich, hot cup of Bailey's

01:04:29.916 --> 01:04:32.193
gets you off to a great start
in the morning,

01:04:32.293 --> 01:04:35.739
- Coffee, Miss Leonard?
- Never touch the stuff. Gives me the runs.

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:38.533
- How about some tea?
- You bet.

01:04:38.633 --> 01:04:42.470
Mm, Bailey's, That royal,
roasted flavour,

01:04:44.431 --> 01:04:47.792
- What do you want?
- It's not important what I want.

01:04:47.892 --> 01:04:52.464
Eddie wants you to pull yourself together.
It's renewal time, Dixie.

01:04:52.564 --> 01:04:58.678
Come on. You're gonna go out there
and you're gonna do the sketch like a pro.

01:04:58.778 --> 01:05:01.986
And strictly from the script, right?

01:05:08.288 --> 01:05:10.899
- That son of ours is something.
- What happened?

01:05:10.999 --> 01:05:14.569
I'm tucking him in bed last night.
He says "Is kissing dirty?"

01:05:14.669 --> 01:05:16.905
- What'd you tell him?
- I said to him:

01:05:17.005 --> 01:05:20.617
"Sex between two people
can be a beautiful thing."

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:23.343
"But between four people, fantastic!"

01:05:24.804 --> 01:05:26.517
Oh, come on.

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:32.726
Everybody clear.
Get the music started. Here we go.

01:05:34.314 --> 01:05:37.092
Well, that's our show.
We hope you liked it.

01:05:37.192 --> 01:05:41.096
We sure liked doing it for you.
And until next week, remember...

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:21.950
We're two minutes short.
Give them a fill.

01:06:46.886 --> 01:06:48.967
Too short?

01:06:49.973 --> 01:06:54.169
Time, we're short time.
Two minutes time.

01:06:54.269 --> 01:06:57.005
Do you have any ideas
what we can do in two minutes?

01:06:57.105 --> 01:06:59.316
Not unless you're part-rabbit.

01:07:06.573 --> 01:07:09.935
The truth is I have been
thinking of something.

01:07:10.035 --> 01:07:12.395
This'll be a surprise to you too, Dix.

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:16.858
There's a war happening
halfway across the world

01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:20.415
in a lonely place called Korea,

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:28.954
So, I was thinking maybe you, me, Wally and
the boys, we give 'em a little Christmas cheer

01:07:29.054 --> 01:07:31.831
and do our Christmas show
in the Yokohama harbour.

01:07:31.931 --> 01:07:34.427
Applause. Push the button.

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:42.438
What do you say?

01:07:47.072 --> 01:07:50.976
Well, Eddie, as long as
we're talking about helping the boys,

01:07:51.076 --> 01:07:54.771
now would be a good time to share
with everyone the magnificent gesture

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:56.940
that this man made today.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.818
There's a time for speaking out
and a time to be modest.

01:07:59.918 --> 01:08:04.281
I know that all your fans will be delighted
to know that earlier today

01:08:04.381 --> 01:08:11.580
Eddie made a personal contribution
to the International Red Cross of $100,000.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.935
What a guy!

01:08:17.268 --> 01:08:19.349
That's my bonus.

01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:24.395
We're out of time, folks.

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:40.955
Me! Me!

01:08:45.212 --> 01:08:47.294
You.

01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:11.096
Tune in next week
and join our special guests:

01:09:11.197 --> 01:09:16.102
Bobo, the wonder chimp, Vicky LaRue
and Chester, and the Flying Feldmans.

01:09:16.202 --> 01:09:19.956
For Bailey's coffee,
I'm Niles LaGuardia.

01:09:26.171 --> 01:09:29.991
- You couldn't say $50,000?
- You're lucky I didn't say a million.

01:09:30.091 --> 01:09:35.455
All right, so... maybe I shouldn't have
sprung it on you like that.

01:09:35.555 --> 01:09:39.042
- I just thought it'd be more dramatic.
- It was dramatic all right.

01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:43.096
- Only trouble is I ain't going.
- Yes, you are.

01:09:45.273 --> 01:09:47.567
- Korea.
- And Japan.

01:09:48.609 --> 01:09:51.345
- Get outta here. I gotta get dressed.
- Mom?

01:09:51.446 --> 01:09:54.265
- Yes, son?
- I'm with Mrs Sparks and the girls.

01:09:54.366 --> 01:09:56.659
We'll be right there. Dix.

01:09:57.827 --> 01:09:59.908
Look...

01:10:02.082 --> 01:10:06.987
- You know what they got in Japan?
- Yeah, radiation.

01:10:07.087 --> 01:10:10.240
That's funny. That's not all.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:14.327
It's... I can't tell you.
It's a fabulous, fabulous country.

01:10:14.427 --> 01:10:19.937
There's mountains and hotels...
Come on outta there, will you?

01:10:20.392 --> 01:10:24.254
They got all these rituals.
They got these special tubs.

01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:29.259
You get in... two people...
and they rub the soap round you.

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:33.430
- What's Margaret gonna do? Hold the towel?
- What is the matter with you?

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:38.852
Soon it's gonna be too late. You'll say "Me
and Eddie could've been beautiful together."

01:10:38.952 --> 01:10:41.730
It really works
when you talk to people like this?

01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:45.859
- You tell me you don't want it.
- I don't want it.

01:10:45.959 --> 01:10:48.904
- You're lying.
- It's not a sex problem with you.

01:10:49.004 --> 01:10:51.085
It's a hearing problem.

01:10:53.425 --> 01:10:58.163
- Hi, Mom. You were great.
- The show was wonderful. I loved it.

01:10:58.263 --> 01:11:00.344
Hi, Uncle Eddie.

01:11:02.809 --> 01:11:04.878
- You guys really going to Korea?
- Yeah.

01:11:04.978 --> 01:11:10.425
But you're all going to join us in Japan for
Christmas. Won't that be wonderful, Eddie?

01:11:10.525 --> 01:11:15.263
- Oh, Eddie. What a lovely idea.
- Keep the families together.

01:11:15.363 --> 01:11:19.059
That's so important
in these uncertain times, don't you think?

01:11:19.159 --> 01:11:23.355
So tell me about this Korea place.
What's it like?

01:11:23.455 --> 01:11:26.579
You're gonna love it.
It's a tropical paradise.

01:11:43.099 --> 01:11:46.294
Just like the Polo Lounge.
Give you something to write about.

01:11:46.394 --> 01:11:49.422
I've never endured
such discomfort before in my life.

01:11:49.522 --> 01:11:54.302
- War is hell. You can quote me on that.
- Go away, go away.

01:11:54.402 --> 01:11:56.483
Get outta the way!

01:11:57.405 --> 01:12:00.826
Get outta here! Get outta here! Come on!

01:12:02.327 --> 01:12:04.646
Goddammit. Lousy gooks.

01:12:04.746 --> 01:12:08.191
What do you expect?
These people have no character.

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:10.527
They got no shoes, lady.

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:13.863
That's irrelevant.
It's a matter of national character.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:16.950
Excellent point, Luanna.
Include it in your next column.

01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:20.245
- They're freezing. Can't we do anything?
- We are.

01:12:20.345 --> 01:12:24.124
We're saving them from Communism.
See their happy faces?

01:12:24.224 --> 01:12:28.044
Cos they don't have to sleep
under some oppressive Communist blanket.

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:34.009
What would you suggest, Mr Silver? We stand
aside and let the Communists take over?

01:12:34.109 --> 01:12:37.637
No. I think we should teach
the Communists our military strategy,

01:12:37.737 --> 01:12:39.931
then they'll be sure to lose.

01:12:40.031 --> 01:12:43.393
- Is that a joke?
- Lady, this whole war's a joke.

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:46.618
- And you can quote me on that.
- Come here.

01:12:51.876 --> 01:12:57.032
- Are you nuts? Are you nuts?
- Eddie, she's a gossip columnist.

01:12:57.132 --> 01:13:02.078
In 200 newspaper outlets, a friend of J Edgar
Hoover's, every network head in her pocket,

01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:04.706
and you wanna trade quips with her?

01:13:04.806 --> 01:13:08.293
She'll bury you!
And I don't want you taking me with you.

01:13:08.393 --> 01:13:10.337
Forget it.

01:13:10.437 --> 01:13:13.423
She is doing a major story on me. Major.

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:16.426
I don't care what you think about
on your own time,

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:21.193
but when you're on salary,
you button it up, all right?

01:13:24.242 --> 01:13:29.272
- Fucking war. Gets everybody crazy.
- Let's load up the trucks right now!

01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:31.441
- We're getting outta here.
- What's up?

01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:35.153
Chinks just jumped in with both feet.
They overran the base an hour ago.

01:13:35.253 --> 01:13:36.752
- Our base?
- Not any more.

01:13:46.139 --> 01:13:49.167
- What the hell's this?
- Do you believe this?

01:13:49.267 --> 01:13:50.627
- Damn.
- Stop!

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:53.046
- We got trouble, Eddie.
- What's going on?

01:13:53.146 --> 01:13:55.590
- Stop!
- Hold it. What's that?

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:58.260
- Stop the truck!
- It's a trap.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:02.138
- It's a marine.
- We got wounded.

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:05.392
- We got VIPs here, man.
- I got fucking wounded!

01:14:05.492 --> 01:14:07.894
- What's the problem?
- There's been an ambush.

01:14:07.994 --> 01:14:12.732
There's men all over the place.
I gotta get these trucks down there.

01:14:12.832 --> 01:14:15.328
- Move!
- Let's go. Hold on.

01:14:34.187 --> 01:14:38.439
You're gonna be fine.
You're on your way home now.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.575
You OK, kid? You're going home.

01:14:55.166 --> 01:14:58.820
I need another pair of hands here!
I need some help, goddammit!

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:03.116
Hang in there, fella. Hold this.
Over here.

01:15:03.216 --> 01:15:05.297
Here. Hold it steady.

01:15:07.095 --> 01:15:12.542
Put pressure here. Let it loose every 15
minutes for 30 seconds or he'll lose a leg.

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:18.006
I need stretcher bearers!
Hold this tight. Who the hell are you?

01:15:18.106 --> 01:15:20.816
- Dixie Leonard.
- The singer?

01:15:22.902 --> 01:15:25.221
Crazy goddamn war.

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:28.099
Hang in there, fella. Hang in there.

01:15:28.199 --> 01:15:31.061
30 seconds every 15 minutes,
Dixie Leonard.

01:15:31.161 --> 01:15:33.039
Let's go! Let's move it out!

01:15:43.089 --> 01:15:47.702
- It's bad, isn't it?
- They're gonna fix you right up.

01:15:47.802 --> 01:15:49.883
- Swear to God.
- Sure.

01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:53.854
Me and Humpty Dumpty.

01:16:00.899 --> 01:16:03.385
Holy shit.

01:16:03.485 --> 01:16:05.387
Eddie Sparks.

01:16:05.487 --> 01:16:09.406
- It's OK. You don't gotta get up.
- Yeah. Right.

01:16:21.211 --> 01:16:23.292
Where you from?

01:16:24.255 --> 01:16:25.838
Wilkes-Barre.

01:16:28.301 --> 01:16:30.180
I played Wilkes-Barre.

01:16:51.574 --> 01:16:54.728
You're gonna be fine.
You're on your way home now.

01:16:54.828 --> 01:16:56.909
Careful, careful.

01:16:57.664 --> 01:16:59.745
I gotta go with him.

01:17:01.459 --> 01:17:03.540
His leg.

01:17:04.671 --> 01:17:07.532
- Hold it. Down.
- The tourniquet. He told me...

01:17:07.632 --> 01:17:10.660
- I know, ma'am. I got it.
- Careful!

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.164
The medic said his leg would be OK.

01:17:14.264 --> 01:17:17.186
Pupils fixed and dilated. He's dead.

01:17:18.476 --> 01:17:21.087
- Belly wound. He never had a chance.
- He can't be.

01:17:21.187 --> 01:17:24.049
- Miss, please.
- No, but he said...

01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:28.317
No, but... But he can't be!
He can't be dead!

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.244
Excuse me, Miss Leonard.

01:17:43.001 --> 01:17:45.070
Follow me, please.

01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:47.251
Please, Miss Leonard.

01:17:49.049 --> 01:17:51.130
Let's go, Mr Sparks.

01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:11.221
This is yours, Mr Sparks. Miss Leonard,
you're the last one on the left, OK?

01:18:11.321 --> 01:18:13.402
Thank you.

01:18:16.868 --> 01:18:18.949
Just kids.

01:18:19.829 --> 01:18:22.207
That's some fucking thing.

01:18:23.291 --> 01:18:26.214
Just a kid. About 19 or 20.

01:18:30.382 --> 01:18:32.463
Sh.

01:18:34.886 --> 01:18:37.872
- Stay with me, Dix.
- Oh, Eddie.

01:18:37.972 --> 01:18:40.765
No, not like that. I...

01:18:42.686 --> 01:18:44.767
I just...

01:18:45.397 --> 01:18:47.924
I don't know.

01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:50.947
I don't wanna be alone, OK?

01:19:12.757 --> 01:19:15.051
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:16.845 --> 01:19:18.926
You're up early.

01:19:19.973 --> 01:19:22.054
Always.

01:19:24.728 --> 01:19:26.809
So what do you think?

01:19:32.152 --> 01:19:34.220
You know what I think?

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:41.289
What I think is this Luanna is gonna get up
any minute, sticking her nose around.

01:19:44.414 --> 01:19:48.251
She'd like this one, too, Luanna.
You and me.

01:19:50.398 --> 01:19:52.443
She'd print it too.

01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:56.191
Jesus.

01:19:57.071 --> 01:19:59.152
Margaret'd kill me.

01:20:12.503 --> 01:20:15.213
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:20:17.592 --> 01:20:22.306
A bunch of guys got killed and we got laid.
Am I missing something?

01:20:26.434 --> 01:20:29.191
- Sorry you feel like that.
- You'll get over it.

01:20:36.277 --> 01:20:42.350
Dixie, last night
was really very, very special.

01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:45.812
Yeah. And we'll always have Paris.

01:20:45.912 --> 01:20:48.606
I swear, I don't know
how to talk to you sometimes.

01:20:48.706 --> 01:20:54.216
Eddie, it's really OK.
But you oughta quit while you're behind.

01:21:15.692 --> 01:21:17.773
Tamaki Kawakubo!

01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:22.577
Domo arigato,

01:21:28.538 --> 01:21:30.619
I'd like to make a toast.

01:21:35.169 --> 01:21:40.700
Eddie, Dixie, on behalf of our fighting
men and women everywhere,

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.343
you're doing a magnificent job.

01:21:44.095 --> 01:21:49.770
To you, to your troupe,
we love you and God bless you.

01:21:50.226 --> 01:21:52.003
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

01:21:52.103 --> 01:21:53.129
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

01:21:53.229 --> 01:21:55.026
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

01:21:57.025 --> 01:22:00.031
- Nice party.
- Yeah, I've had worse.

01:22:04.073 --> 01:22:10.146
Eddie, the sponsors are getting
a lot of heat about this writer of yours.

01:22:10.246 --> 01:22:14.109
- Art Silver.
- Art Silver? What kind of heat?

01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:18.460
Well, they... they say he's a Red.

01:22:19.505 --> 01:22:23.159
He signed some things.
I don't know what.

01:22:23.259 --> 01:22:26.371
He's not gonna overthrow anything.
He's a comedy writer.

01:22:26.471 --> 01:22:32.877
I know that, but these guys have got a bug
up their ass about this whole commie thing.

01:22:32.977 --> 01:22:36.631
Yeah, well, I'll talk to him.

01:22:36.731 --> 01:22:40.271
Yeah, well, it's past that.

01:22:41.236 --> 01:22:43.732
They want him off the show.

01:22:44.405 --> 01:22:48.184
- That's ridiculous.
- Eddie, they're ready to walk.

01:22:48.284 --> 01:22:51.855
I mean it. They're not signing
unless he's off the payroll.

01:22:51.955 --> 01:22:55.442
- They want you to handle it now.
- What do you mean, now?

01:22:55.542 --> 01:22:57.986
- Tonight.
- It's Christmas.

01:22:58.086 --> 01:23:02.407
Eddie, we are talking
about a five-year renewal.

01:23:02.507 --> 01:23:05.003
Now, please, think about it.

01:23:08.596 --> 01:23:12.041
I'll tell you what, fuck doing the work.
Go to another network.

01:23:12.141 --> 01:23:16.546
They're all the same. They're all
cleaning house. Actors, directors, writers.

01:23:16.646 --> 01:23:18.965
It's a bloodbath.

01:23:19.065 --> 01:23:23.649
Eddie, my friend,
that's just the way things are now.

01:23:26.781 --> 01:23:30.727
Me and Art...
18 years we've been together.

01:23:30.827 --> 01:23:34.773
You gotta stop thinking about just yourself.
You got a lot of responsibility.

01:23:34.873 --> 01:23:41.295
You got a lot of people on the payroll.
You can't afford to be controversial.

01:23:58.563 --> 01:24:02.400
Is this a private party
or can anybody get in?

01:24:23.379 --> 01:24:26.385
And have you been a good little boy?

01:24:27.008 --> 01:24:29.077
Listen, you got a minute?

01:24:29.177 --> 01:24:31.720
All right, smile!

01:24:32.263 --> 01:24:34.344
Good, that's terrific.

01:24:37.602 --> 01:24:42.269
- Nice to have you aboard.
- Thank you. Nice being here.

01:24:44.234 --> 01:24:46.315
It's done.

01:24:48.655 --> 01:24:52.527
Merry Christmas!

01:24:59.958 --> 01:25:04.654
Oh, my heavens.
Is that Miss Luanna Trott?

01:25:04.754 --> 01:25:08.045
What do we have for little Luanna today?

01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:12.787
Something to get around on.

01:25:12.887 --> 01:25:14.581
Ho-ho-ho!

01:25:14.681 --> 01:25:17.889
- I'll save it for Halloween.
- Good sport, Luanna.

01:25:19.269 --> 01:25:20.795
Ho-ho-ho!

01:25:22.313 --> 01:25:24.757
And who have we here?
What's your name, son?

01:25:24.857 --> 01:25:29.512
- Come on, Uncle Art. It's me, Danny.
- Danny, you rotten little kid.

01:25:29.612 --> 01:25:34.017
What you got on your hat there, Danny?
I see some writing on your hat.

01:25:34.117 --> 01:25:36.269
USS Missouri.

01:25:36.369 --> 01:25:42.662
And here it is. A perfect replica
of the USS Missouri for you.

01:25:46.754 --> 01:25:50.543
Oh, and Mr Admiral.
We haven't forgotten you.

01:25:51.509 --> 01:25:56.915
Mr Admiral has big responsibilities
during the Christmas period.

01:25:57.015 --> 01:26:00.001
What could we give to Mr Admiral?

01:26:00.101 --> 01:26:02.003
Oh, my goodness.

01:26:02.103 --> 01:26:08.718
Another replica of his ship,
the USS Missouri.

01:26:08.818 --> 01:26:12.806
- She never looked better.
- And no shelling the civilians, promise?

01:26:12.906 --> 01:26:14.987
I promise.

01:26:16.326 --> 01:26:21.231
And who's this lovely lady?
I'll bet you we have something really nice.

01:26:21.331 --> 01:26:26.027
Well, let's see here. It's an autographed
picture of her husband,

01:26:26.127 --> 01:26:31.968
personally inscribed: "To Margaret.
Best wishes. Eddie Sparks."

01:26:34.761 --> 01:26:37.257
I'll cherish this for ever.

01:26:39.807 --> 01:26:42.377
God, it isn't. Is it?

01:26:42.477 --> 01:26:45.672
I don't have my glasses.
It is. It's Eddie Sparks.

01:26:45.772 --> 01:26:50.176
- Have you been a good boy, Eddie?
- Don't do this.

01:26:50.276 --> 01:26:53.199
Don't do this? This is what I do.

01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:59.185
Don't be a schmuck.
We'll work it out under the table, all right?

01:26:59.285 --> 01:27:06.752
Under the table? I can't work under
the table. That's where all the rats are.

01:27:07.544 --> 01:27:12.839
And now, boys and girls,
it's time for Uncle Eddie's present!

01:27:14.008 --> 01:27:16.255
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

01:27:29.023 --> 01:27:32.528
Oh, look, Eddie. There's a note.

01:27:33.861 --> 01:27:37.816
- Why don't you read it?
- Why don't you read it?

01:27:39.951 --> 01:27:42.032
OK, I will.

01:27:51.629 --> 01:27:53.710
"Dear Eddie."

01:27:57.176 --> 01:28:00.266
"I wrote my first joke
for you on this, June 1932."

01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:08.254
"I thought you should have it...
for your trophy case."

01:28:08.354 --> 01:28:11.111
Signed: "Your pal."

01:28:14.861 --> 01:28:16.942
"Art."

01:28:22.243 --> 01:28:27.607
Well, boys and girls,
it's time to go back to the North Pole.

01:28:27.707 --> 01:28:29.788
Ho-ho-ho!

01:28:31.628 --> 01:28:34.966
Happy Hanukkah and to all, sayonara!

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.859
- You fired him?
- You stay out of this.

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.138
Wally, play some music. This is a party.
Dance, everybody dance.

01:28:58.238 --> 01:29:00.557
- Some high drama here.
- I'll fix it.

01:29:00.657 --> 01:29:04.362
- May I have this dance?
- You can go fuck yourself.

01:29:05.537 --> 01:29:08.481
Come here.
You know where you're going here?

01:29:08.581 --> 01:29:11.568
You wanna give it away
because he wants to live in Russia?

01:29:11.668 --> 01:29:16.239
- What the hell did he do? Sign a petition.
- These guys control the network.

01:29:16.339 --> 01:29:18.950
He's your friend.
Tell 'em to go to hell.

01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:21.578
I'm not committing suicide
for Art or anyone.

01:29:21.678 --> 01:29:25.790
You are so full of shit.
You're worse than they are.

01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:29.794
Who did this? Who did this?
Was it you, Luanna?

01:29:29.894 --> 01:29:33.756
You smug bitch.
Did you put my uncle's name on a list?

01:29:33.856 --> 01:29:39.554
Did you? What are you smiling at? You did.
Or you, Sam, was it you?

01:29:39.654 --> 01:29:43.028
Or you? Or you, or you?

01:29:44.284 --> 01:29:49.314
Who's next, fellas? Rudolph? He's got
a red nose too. We can't be too careful.

01:29:49.414 --> 01:29:53.276
Hey! I got a great idea!
Let's form a club.

01:29:53.376 --> 01:29:58.782
Everybody who joins gets a button...
"I got screwed by Eddie Sparks."

01:29:58.882 --> 01:30:03.620
- Don't worry, Eddie. She doesn't mean it.
- Come on, we're going home.

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:08.249
- It's OK, son. She's just tired.
- Look at him. See who he really is.

01:30:08.349 --> 01:30:11.711
This man threw your Uncle Art out
like a piece of garbage.

01:30:11.811 --> 01:30:16.508
You wanna grow up to be like him?
Sure, turn your wife into a drunk.

01:30:16.608 --> 01:30:19.344
- Use people up and throw 'em away!
- It's OK, Eddie.

01:30:19.444 --> 01:30:23.696
- And he's gonna throw you away too!
- It's OK, son.

01:30:25.491 --> 01:30:27.572
Come on.

01:30:29.621 --> 01:30:34.169
He's a monster! Come to me! Come to Mom.

01:30:34.834 --> 01:30:36.319
Mom...

01:30:36.419 --> 01:30:40.671
You can't have him!
You keep your hands off my son!

01:30:52.852 --> 01:30:54.933
It's OK, son. It's OK.

01:31:02.195 --> 01:31:06.266
I believe that our generation
will change the world.

01:31:06.366 --> 01:31:09.490
I believe in freedom and honour,

01:31:10.995 --> 01:31:15.247
hard work and the genius
of the American system.

01:31:17.001 --> 01:31:23.825
I believe in the need to protect that system
with strength and justice and compassion

01:31:23.925 --> 01:31:26.619
wherever it is threatened.

01:31:26.719 --> 01:31:32.644
I believe in respect for rank
and the wisdom of our founding fathers.

01:31:34.352 --> 01:31:36.433
I believe in America.

01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:44.315
To love it and defend it as my father did
with the ultimate sacrifice.

01:31:47.365 --> 01:31:50.977
I believe in the importance of family,

01:31:51.077 --> 01:31:54.914
in my mother and her spirit.

01:32:02.672 --> 01:32:07.422
What the hell could I do?
There was Eddie every time I turned around.

01:32:09.762 --> 01:32:14.061
And you know what? Danny loved him.

01:32:15.977 --> 01:32:19.005
I never had a chance.

01:32:19.105 --> 01:32:22.444
- And you and Eddie?
- We hardly spoke.

01:32:24.986 --> 01:32:29.599
Network dropped me like a hot potato.
They said I was...

01:32:29.699 --> 01:32:32.644
- Controversial?
- Bingo.

01:32:32.744 --> 01:32:35.688
That was me. Isn't that a hoot?

01:32:35.788 --> 01:32:42.792
Me, who always thought Karl Marx
was the sixth Marx brother after Zeppo.

01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:48.201
Eddie stayed with the show but...
it never really worked.

01:32:48.301 --> 01:32:50.411
Cancelled him after a season.

01:32:50.511 --> 01:32:54.514
- So what did you do?
- What did I do? What didn't I do?

01:32:55.892 --> 01:33:01.256
Dinner theatre, stock, club dates.

01:33:01.356 --> 01:33:06.678
Saved up a little money, bought myself
a little bistro in Hollywood.

01:33:06.778 --> 01:33:09.472
A jazz club.

01:33:09.572 --> 01:33:12.475
I liked it. Friends would come by.

01:33:12.575 --> 01:33:14.656
And Danny?

01:33:19.916 --> 01:33:21.568
Danny.

01:33:24.254 --> 01:33:28.636
- Bring him back here,
- Remember to stop the bleeding!

01:33:31.553 --> 01:33:37.181
These frantic efforts were to no avail,
The wounded man was dead,

01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:49.115
Purple smoke marks the landing zone as
the medevac helicopter arrives minutes later,

01:34:11.718 --> 01:34:15.205
- Twice in one week?
- I'm a fan.

01:34:21.519 --> 01:34:23.600
Thank you.

01:34:26.024 --> 01:34:30.136
Eddie called. Couple of weeks ago.

01:34:30.236 --> 01:34:35.448
He called a lot, actually.
I went over, we got to talking.

01:34:36.409 --> 01:34:40.522
He gave an interview about me
in the LA Times,

01:34:40.622 --> 01:34:44.776
The whole blacklisting thing
is coming out this Sunday.

01:34:44.876 --> 01:34:47.362
You know what he said?

01:34:47.462 --> 01:34:51.533
"I don't much about Art,
but I know what I like."

01:34:51.633 --> 01:34:55.220
Very clever line.
Did you write it for him?

01:34:58.056 --> 01:35:03.055
15 years, Dixie.
I can't drag it around any more.

01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:07.799
I don't wanna end up
writing for Beat the Clock,

01:35:07.899 --> 01:35:13.596
Art, you're my uncle and I love you.
Do what you gotta do, all right?

01:35:13.696 --> 01:35:17.642
There's a kicker.
The network wants a special.

01:35:17.742 --> 01:35:20.812
Eddie Sparks' 25th anniversary
of the first tour.

01:35:20.912 --> 01:35:25.108
- They're throwing money at him.
- America, the land of the fee.

01:35:25.208 --> 01:35:27.704
Two weeks in Vietnam.

01:35:28.795 --> 01:35:33.592
We got Loretta, Wally,
everybody from the old group.

01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:37.579
- Not everybody.
- At least hear him out.

01:35:37.679 --> 01:35:40.248
Would you do that? For me?

01:35:40.348 --> 01:35:43.960
For old times. We owe him, Dixie.

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.141
I owe him, all right.

01:35:47.272 --> 01:35:49.353
He's outside.

01:35:51.776 --> 01:35:55.763
He was afraid to come in. He's out there
sitting in the goddamn limousine.

01:35:55.863 --> 01:35:58.786
Can I tell him it's OK to come in?

01:36:00.285 --> 01:36:02.562
He sent you in here for this?

01:36:02.662 --> 01:36:05.064
Who's he gonna send?

01:36:05.164 --> 01:36:08.087
Sam's dead. The girls are gone.

01:36:09.210 --> 01:36:11.967
Margaret's left him. We're all he's got.

01:36:15.466 --> 01:36:17.577
Come here.

01:36:17.677 --> 01:36:22.207
- Look, it's Eddie Sparks, right there.
- Oh, yeah. Look, Eddie Sparks.

01:36:22.307 --> 01:36:25.919
- Hi, Mr Sparks. How you doing?
- Hi. I'm looking for Dixie.

01:36:26.019 --> 01:36:30.401
- She's waiting for you right over there.
- Thanks.

01:36:34.777 --> 01:36:36.858
Excuse me, sir.

01:36:39.324 --> 01:36:41.701
It's Eddie Sparks!

01:36:51.127 --> 01:36:53.988
- Mind if I sit down?
- It's a free country.

01:36:54.088 --> 01:36:56.169
So far, anyway.

01:37:05.099 --> 01:37:07.180
So...

01:37:09.854 --> 01:37:12.549
Art, you spoke to him, yeah?

01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:14.611
Oh, yeah.

01:37:16.152 --> 01:37:19.264
- So what do you think?
- I think your hairpiece is too tight.

01:37:19.364 --> 01:37:23.184
It's starting to affect your brain.

01:37:23.284 --> 01:37:25.365
Always with the quips.

01:37:28.498 --> 01:37:30.994
You know, you and me.

01:37:32.502 --> 01:37:34.167
You and me.

01:37:35.588 --> 01:37:39.009
Back together again. We could show 'em.

01:37:41.177 --> 01:37:44.634
Dixie, I wanna do it again.

01:37:46.641 --> 01:37:48.501
Big show, big audience.

01:37:48.601 --> 01:37:52.213
Not this television shit,
300 people in the bedroom.

01:37:52.313 --> 01:37:54.394
I mean 10,000.

01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:58.231
That sound, remember?

01:38:03.533 --> 01:38:05.780
Oh, my.

01:38:11.666 --> 01:38:15.987
I wanna do it again.
What do you say? One more time.

01:38:16.087 --> 01:38:19.115
- I'm not in the business.
- Look...

01:38:19.215 --> 01:38:21.296
We could see Danny.

01:38:22.594 --> 01:38:26.706
Look. He writes to me all the time.
He writes to me all the time.

01:38:26.806 --> 01:38:28.583
Here, look, look.

01:38:28.683 --> 01:38:33.213
Saigon... Now, look...

01:38:33.313 --> 01:38:36.022
Look, Danny. Danny, Danny...

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.481
Look, I got friends.

01:38:40.528 --> 01:38:45.058
State Department, four-star generals,
the president, they owe me.

01:38:45.158 --> 01:38:47.811
Don't do this.

01:38:47.911 --> 01:38:53.233
I could get us in. Don't you wanna
see your boy? Don't you wanna see him?

01:38:53.333 --> 01:38:57.715
I do. Come on. You wanna see him, right?

01:39:00.673 --> 01:39:03.169
You son of a bitch.

01:39:19.567 --> 01:39:23.513
Hey, why is he following the road?

01:39:23.613 --> 01:39:28.852
- Cos he's afraid to fly over the jungle.
- Afraid? Of being seen?

01:39:28.952 --> 01:39:31.033
A lot of VC, right?

01:39:32.163 --> 01:39:35.024
I'll be straight with you, Eddie.
I don't like this.

01:39:35.124 --> 01:39:39.070
You got no business being here.
I can't guarantee your safety.

01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:41.906
Don't worry about it.

01:39:42.006 --> 01:39:45.630
- There it is.
- Where? Over there?

01:39:49.347 --> 01:39:51.428
Oh, my God.

01:40:16.124 --> 01:40:21.503
You got one hour to do what you gotta do
and then we're outta here. Got it?

01:40:46.446 --> 01:40:48.640
Where is he?

01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:51.893
He's out checking perimeter guards.
He'll be back in a while.

01:40:51.993 --> 01:40:56.481
Get your choppers back here by 1430 hours.
I can't guarantee air cover after that.

01:40:56.581 --> 01:40:59.901
Don't worry. We got a big show
in Bien Hoa tonight.

01:41:00.001 --> 01:41:02.082
10,000 guys.

01:41:03.796 --> 01:41:06.672
That's certainly a lot of guys.

01:41:07.926 --> 01:41:12.094
I'd like to get a look
at the stage area if I could.

01:41:14.349 --> 01:41:17.919
I know the men
are gonna really enjoy the show.

01:41:18.019 --> 01:41:20.380
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.561
Thank you, Major.

01:41:27.278 --> 01:41:29.359
Pretty exciting, huh?

01:41:30.031 --> 01:41:32.361
Yeah, I guess so.

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.576
Yeah? Help you, son?

01:41:42.794 --> 01:41:46.168
So I finally got you two
in the same room.

01:41:48.841 --> 01:41:50.785
Danny.

01:41:50.885 --> 01:41:54.164
- Danny, Danny, Danny.
- Ma.

01:41:54.264 --> 01:41:57.223
It's OK. It's OK, Ma.

01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:03.350
Hello, son.

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:07.067
Good to see you again.

01:42:20.582 --> 01:42:24.068
You're mixing it up pretty good,
I hear, huh? Huh?

01:42:24.168 --> 01:42:26.250
Sir?

01:42:29.549 --> 01:42:32.887
Charlie action, firefights, like that.

01:42:35.221 --> 01:42:37.302
Yeah.

01:42:39.434 --> 01:42:41.312
They're out there.

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:45.089
You look like hell.

01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:48.593
I'm fine. I'm fine, Ma.

01:42:48.693 --> 01:42:54.736
I can't tell you how damn proud we are
of what you're doing here.

01:42:57.076 --> 01:43:00.647
We're gonna beat
those little bastards, you know.

01:43:00.747 --> 01:43:03.525
Yes, sir.

01:43:03.625 --> 01:43:06.121
As soon as we find 'em.

01:43:13.468 --> 01:43:15.964
- Williams.
- Captain Danny.

01:43:17.931 --> 01:43:19.513
- O'Connor.
- Hi, Captain.

01:43:46.543 --> 01:43:48.194
Come on.

01:43:48.294 --> 01:43:50.447
What? What is it, Danny?

01:43:50.547 --> 01:43:53.469
Honey, talk to me, for God's sake.

01:43:54.384 --> 01:43:58.552
It's a shame, really.
Such a beautiful country.

01:44:00.181 --> 01:44:04.978
I don't know how it's ever gonna
come back from all this.

01:44:19.117 --> 01:44:22.020
- He doesn't get it, does he?
- Honey, don't say that.

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.440
He moved heaven and earth
to bring us here.

01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:28.036
With the cameras.

01:44:30.587 --> 01:44:34.240
- He's gonna get it all on film, right?
- Why are you surprised?

01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:37.577
What have you been writing him
all this time?

01:44:37.677 --> 01:44:39.758
What he wanted to hear.

01:44:40.847 --> 01:44:43.936
- What'd you want me to write?
- The truth.

01:44:45.685 --> 01:44:47.766
The truth?

01:44:54.235 --> 01:44:57.158
See that kid up there?

01:44:58.281 --> 01:45:00.029
The corporal?

01:45:01.451 --> 01:45:03.019
Yeah.

01:45:03.119 --> 01:45:05.563
He's a sweet kid.

01:45:05.663 --> 01:45:07.732
He's from Chicago.

01:45:07.832 --> 01:45:10.542
His father's a schoolteacher.

01:45:14.464 --> 01:45:16.960
He collects ears.

01:45:22.513 --> 01:45:25.638
He cuts the ears off of dead bodies.

01:45:27.894 --> 01:45:31.714
He's got a hell
of a little collection of 'em.

01:45:31.814 --> 01:45:33.895
In 20, 25 years...

01:45:37.487 --> 01:45:41.027
he's gonna sell them stateside, he says.

01:45:53.127 --> 01:45:55.208
I gotta send him home.

01:45:57.799 --> 01:46:00.924
He's only 19 years old and he's gone.

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:04.801
It's a nightmare.

01:46:05.890 --> 01:46:07.971
Please.

01:46:14.065 --> 01:46:20.680
You know, Eddie, he's got a lot of friends.
He could get you out of here.

01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:24.830
I'm a captain, Mom.
I got men under me here.

01:46:28.329 --> 01:46:30.732
And anyway....

01:46:30.832 --> 01:46:33.542
it'd break Eddie's heart.

01:46:36.588 --> 01:46:40.617
I went to the doctor.
He said my sex life was all in my head.

01:46:40.717 --> 01:46:44.245
I said "Yeah, I know,
I want it lowered."

01:46:45.471 --> 01:46:51.669
You gotta laugh or else they're gonna sell me
to the VC for target practice.

01:46:51.769 --> 01:46:54.506
- Where are the girls?
- Girls!

01:46:54.606 --> 01:46:58.443
- Girls!
- Hold it. Did I hear girls?

01:47:01.529 --> 01:47:03.491
We got girls!

01:47:04.908 --> 01:47:08.246
We got girls!

01:47:09.746 --> 01:47:11.856
Hey, Janie, come here!

01:48:34.414 --> 01:48:36.495
Hey, hey, hey!

01:48:38.877 --> 01:48:40.945
Hold it, hold it.

01:48:41.045 --> 01:48:43.624
Hold it, hold it. Guys, guys, guys.

01:48:46.551 --> 01:48:48.453
Come here, come here.

01:48:48.553 --> 01:48:51.206
Let's have a hand
for little Janie Perkins.

01:48:53.933 --> 01:48:58.316
She'll be back later.
She's gonna do more later. Lighten up.

01:48:59.105 --> 01:49:01.683
Now back off here a little bit.

01:49:02.567 --> 01:49:05.489
I got a special treat for you guys.

01:49:06.446 --> 01:49:08.527
I'm gonna tell you now.

01:49:09.490 --> 01:49:13.561
You know your captain Danny Leonard?

01:49:13.661 --> 01:49:15.955
Hell of a man, hell of a man.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.713
His mother...

01:49:21.711 --> 01:49:27.470
His mother flew 12,000 miles
to be with him and to be with you.

01:49:32.388 --> 01:49:35.750
Best singer I've ever heard.

01:49:35.850 --> 01:49:39.087
She's here for you guys.
Let me bring her out.

01:49:39.187 --> 01:49:42.193
The wonderful Miss Dixie Leonard.

01:49:49.239 --> 01:49:51.735
Dixie! Dixie!

01:49:52.867 --> 01:49:54.948
All right, shut up.

01:49:55.995 --> 01:49:58.076
Shut up!

01:49:59.332 --> 01:50:04.904
You guys are the sorriest bunch of grunts
I ever saw in my life.

01:50:05.004 --> 01:50:07.198
Where the hell did you learn
your manners?

01:50:07.298 --> 01:50:11.828
Don't you know you're supposed to say
"excuse me" before you attack a lady?

01:50:11.928 --> 01:50:14.768
Show us your tits, Mama!

01:50:22.313 --> 01:50:27.111
I would, sonny,
but you'd probably have a heart attack.

01:50:30.196 --> 01:50:33.404
All right, shut the fuck up.

01:50:36.327 --> 01:50:41.125
It's Christmas time.
Gonna sing a little song for you.

01:51:18.661 --> 01:51:22.232
I need stuff like Danny listening.

01:51:22.332 --> 01:51:25.955
He's not in the audience.
I can't find him.

01:51:28.379 --> 01:51:30.792
Keep looking, will you?

01:53:49.979 --> 01:53:51.728
Incoming!

01:53:53.483 --> 01:53:54.592
Drop! Drop!

01:53:54.692 --> 01:53:56.773
Move it! Move it! Move it!

01:53:58.404 --> 01:54:01.944
Get down in there, you hear me?
Don't come out!

01:57:24.319 --> 01:57:29.780
We flew back with him
on the plane, Eddie and me,

01:57:30.575 --> 01:57:33.415
And... we buried him,

01:57:34.204 --> 01:57:36.700
and we never spoke again,

01:57:38.875 --> 01:57:41.335
25 years,

01:57:53.306 --> 01:57:57.178
Listen, why don't you just relax?

01:57:58.394 --> 01:58:02.382
Just close your eyes
for a couple of minutes, OK?

01:58:02.482 --> 01:58:04.563
Do that for me?

01:58:05.985 --> 01:58:08.066
I'll be right back.

01:58:12.825 --> 01:58:18.536
The thing you wanna avoid
is outlasting everybody.

01:58:20.583 --> 01:58:23.319
Can you remember that?

01:58:23.419 --> 01:58:25.500
Sure.

01:58:26.047 --> 01:58:28.128
Good.

01:58:29.676 --> 01:58:31.757
Just close your eyes.

01:58:33.513 --> 01:58:35.594
I've gotta...

01:58:36.182 --> 01:58:40.434
I'm gonna be right back, OK?
Just two minutes, OK?

01:58:50.238 --> 01:58:53.600
Where the hell are you? We go in 20 minutes.
Eddie's asking for her.

01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:58.605
Forget it. You don't want her
on the stage with him. Not on live TV.

01:58:58.705 --> 01:59:01.191
- What happened?
- Her life.

01:59:01.291 --> 01:59:03.985
Jesus, don't get poetic with me,
you little putz!

01:59:04.085 --> 01:59:09.199
- Listen, it won't work, Stan.
- OK, dump her and get your ass down here.

01:59:09.299 --> 01:59:13.882
I don't think so, Stan.
She needs to be with somebody.

01:59:16.639 --> 01:59:18.803
Is everything all right?

01:59:19.893 --> 01:59:22.685
Go see if Joan Collins
is out in the audience.

01:59:25.565 --> 01:59:27.646
Miss Leonard?

01:59:29.903 --> 01:59:35.827
Jesus. Miss Leonard, are you all right?
Miss Leonard! Miss Leonard!

01:59:37.911 --> 01:59:40.438
Miss Leonard.

01:59:40.538 --> 01:59:43.358
Open this door, goddammit! Dixie!

01:59:43.458 --> 01:59:45.539
It opens out, genius.

01:59:50.548 --> 01:59:53.076
You're dressed.

01:59:53.176 --> 01:59:55.423
Balenciaga. What do you think?

01:59:57.972 --> 02:00:00.291
You look beautiful.

02:00:00.391 --> 02:00:03.294
You thought I was taking
a bunch of sleeping pills.

02:00:03.394 --> 02:00:04.212
No, I...

02:00:04.312 --> 02:00:07.173
This dress cost me.
I ain't gonna waste it. Let's go.

02:00:07.273 --> 02:00:09.759
You're gonna do it?

02:00:09.859 --> 02:00:14.264
50 million people.
He can't handle that by himself.

02:00:14.364 --> 02:00:17.475
And that better be a stretch limo
or you're in deep shit.

02:00:17.575 --> 02:00:19.602
Yes, ma'am.

02:00:39.556 --> 02:00:44.057
Stand by with the girls, please.
Ready to cue the girls in and cue 'em in.

02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:06.372
And ready, boys.
And dissolve... Send them in.

02:01:20.346 --> 02:01:23.833
- She's coming!
- Here she is!

02:01:23.933 --> 02:01:27.045
Miss Leonard! Can we have a picture?

02:01:27.145 --> 02:01:29.522
Come on, back off. Back off!

02:01:32.567 --> 02:01:34.636
Let her through!

02:01:34.736 --> 02:01:37.806
Come on, Miss Leonard.

02:01:37.906 --> 02:01:39.987
Please!

02:01:41.075 --> 02:01:43.520
- Keep the hands in.
- What?

02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:48.316
- She's here.
- Great. Get her into make-up quick.

02:01:48.416 --> 02:01:50.627
Standby on two. And take it.

02:01:59.761 --> 02:02:01.329
Get outta the way.

02:02:01.429 --> 02:02:04.415
Miss Leonard, I'm Stan.
I'm the producer.

02:02:04.515 --> 02:02:07.669
This is such an honour.
We're thrilled you decided to come.

02:02:07.769 --> 02:02:10.046
- Where's Eddie?
- No time for that.

02:02:10.146 --> 02:02:14.300
After this number we go to commercial,
then the tape of the president's greeting,

02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:18.805
then the film clips, then we intro
Senator Ramsey for the presentation,

02:02:18.905 --> 02:02:24.352
then you and Eddie, "Glad to be here",
couple of shticks, then you do your thing.

02:02:24.452 --> 02:02:26.938
- Sounds lovely.
- Five minutes,

02:02:27.038 --> 02:02:28.523
- Where?
- Make-up.

02:02:28.623 --> 02:02:30.525
- This way.
- Right over there.

02:02:30.625 --> 02:02:34.378
Where are you going?
Hey, kid, I am talking to you.

02:02:51.646 --> 02:02:55.186
Son of a bitch still makes me nervous.

02:02:56.568 --> 02:03:00.388
You go easy on him.
Remember, he's an endangered species.

02:03:00.488 --> 02:03:02.569
Ain't we all?

02:03:04.409 --> 02:03:07.604
- Thank you.
- For what?

02:03:07.704 --> 02:03:12.484
You know, showing up,
being a pushy assistant.

02:03:12.584 --> 02:03:14.903
Ex pushy assistant.

02:03:15.003 --> 02:03:18.323
You got a bigger talent,
like your mother says.

02:03:18.423 --> 02:03:20.504
You can fix things.

02:03:23.344 --> 02:03:26.469
- Goodbye, Miss Leonard.
- Goodbye.

02:03:27.515 --> 02:03:29.596
Ooh!

02:03:47.493 --> 02:03:51.523
Miss Leonard! I can't believe it.
I'm Lou Presti, Eddie's manager.

02:03:51.623 --> 02:03:55.921
Eddie, look who's here.
You won't believe it.

02:03:59.714 --> 02:04:02.992
Well, the "late" Dixie Leonard.

02:04:03.092 --> 02:04:06.746
- Hello, Eddie.
- Lou, that's five dollars you owe me.

02:04:06.846 --> 02:04:08.957
- You got it.
- We had a little side bet.

02:04:09.057 --> 02:04:13.419
He said "She's not coming. Forget about it.
She can't take the pressure."

02:04:13.519 --> 02:04:16.005
I said "This one, you don't know."

02:04:16.105 --> 02:04:20.009
Couldn't stay away, huh?
50 million people.

02:04:20.109 --> 02:04:22.345
That's a Leica, isn't it?

02:04:22.445 --> 02:04:26.057
Right. That's very good.
Are you a photographer, Miss Leonard?

02:04:26.157 --> 02:04:29.269
No, but my husband was. May I see that?

02:04:29.369 --> 02:04:31.521
Sure, sure.

02:04:31.621 --> 02:04:36.526
- It's kinda heavy. Be careful.
- Yes, I see. Oh, my. Yes.

02:04:36.626 --> 02:04:39.487
Don't touch that.
What the hell are you doin'?

02:04:39.587 --> 02:04:44.325
- Those are all my shots!
- You want pictures of me, you ask me.

02:04:44.425 --> 02:04:46.506
Lou, Lou.

02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:51.624
- Clear the room.
- Please, would you mind, everybody?

02:04:51.724 --> 02:04:55.394
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

02:04:56.437 --> 02:04:58.173
Eddie...

02:04:58.273 --> 02:05:00.354
Please, please.

02:05:05.822 --> 02:05:08.892
So I see the years
have not mellowed you.

02:05:08.992 --> 02:05:12.103
You want mellow,
buy yourself a Rudy Vallee record.

02:05:12.203 --> 02:05:14.497
Funny.

02:05:15.957 --> 02:05:19.235
Listen up. You cleared the room.
Now what?

02:05:19.335 --> 02:05:25.241
- I don't know. I thought we could talk.
- I don't wanna talk. I wanna get ready.

02:05:25.341 --> 02:05:27.869
Yeah, but I wanna talk.

02:05:27.969 --> 02:05:30.050
About what?

02:05:32.307 --> 02:05:36.878
How about sleep? Old people
are always talking about sleep.

02:05:36.978 --> 02:05:42.091
- How you been sleeping lately, Eddie?
- Me? Like a baby. How about yourself?

02:05:42.191 --> 02:05:44.273
Not so good.

02:05:45.153 --> 02:05:48.640
I dream a lot. Then I wake up.

02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:53.770
- You should try some warm milk.
- No. I like the dreams.

02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:56.815
They're very enlightening.

02:05:56.915 --> 02:05:59.901
Do you believe
in the unconscious, Eddie?

02:06:00.001 --> 02:06:03.947
Personally, I prefer the conscious.
They pay more attention.

02:06:04.047 --> 02:06:08.284
You still got your touch, Eddie. Even though
you do look like a goddamn turtle.

02:06:08.384 --> 02:06:11.871
- Thank you. You look good yourself.
- Thanks. Mind if I smoke?

02:06:11.971 --> 02:06:15.416
- I don't care if you burn.
- What a prince.

02:06:15.516 --> 02:06:19.754
I had a doosey of a dream last night.
You were in it. You wanna hear it?

02:06:19.854 --> 02:06:21.935
- No.
- It was fantastic.

02:06:24.525 --> 02:06:28.388
I dreamed I died and went to heaven.

02:06:28.488 --> 02:06:33.783
And the angels... the angels told me
I could ask God one question.

02:06:35.078 --> 02:06:40.900
So I said... I was very excited...
I said "God, first you took Michael."

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.257
"I sort of understand that. He was wild.
He was reckless. Fantastic in bed."

02:06:48.258 --> 02:06:50.339
"OK, so Michael."

02:06:51.427 --> 02:06:56.082
"But then Danny too.
Why'd you take 'em both? I gotta know."

02:06:56.182 --> 02:06:58.960
And you know what God said?

02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:03.756
He said "It's the price."
I said "What for?"

02:07:03.856 --> 02:07:09.387
He said "It's the price for the good times,
for the fun, for the laughs,

02:07:09.487 --> 02:07:13.099
for the applause, for the career,
for you and Eddie."

02:07:13.199 --> 02:07:15.268
"Think there's a free lunch, girlie?"

02:07:15.368 --> 02:07:20.231
He talked like he was from the William Morris
office. In fact, that's who I think he is.

02:07:20.331 --> 02:07:23.109
Yeah. So now you're through?

02:07:23.209 --> 02:07:25.290
No.

02:07:26.212 --> 02:07:28.625
We did it.

02:07:29.716 --> 02:07:32.212
We put a uniform on him.

02:07:34.012 --> 02:07:38.082
- Don't do this.
- He loved us and we put him in the ground.

02:07:38.182 --> 02:07:39.250
All right.

02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:43.338
It's 25 years. I can't go on like this.

02:07:43.438 --> 02:07:45.924
I need you. I can't do it alone.

02:07:46.024 --> 02:07:49.010
You listen to me, you crazy bitch!

02:07:49.110 --> 02:07:51.221
I never killed nobody!

02:07:51.321 --> 02:07:55.240
I never started the wars.
I'm not a fucking general!

02:07:57.869 --> 02:08:00.365
I'm a song-and-dance man.

02:08:03.416 --> 02:08:07.529
We went out there and we made 'em forget
for a couple of hours.

02:08:07.629 --> 02:08:11.616
- It's not that simple.
- I'm proud of what we done, Dixie.

02:08:11.716 --> 02:08:18.164
I'm proud of every minute.
I'm proud of every show. It was an honour.

02:08:18.264 --> 02:08:20.792
- A sacred honour.
- Dixie and Eddie, places,

02:08:20.892 --> 02:08:22.973
Dixie...

02:08:24.270 --> 02:08:26.766
I know he died.

02:08:28.191 --> 02:08:31.511
Him and a million others.
Why don't you mourn for them?

02:08:31.611 --> 02:08:33.972
- I do.
- Well, so do I.

02:08:34.072 --> 02:08:38.977
So do I! But you pick yourself up. You don't
waste your life and chew on this thing!

02:08:39.077 --> 02:08:43.064
I didn't waste my life.
I made something of my life.

02:08:43.164 --> 02:08:47.444
I gave birth to him.
I nursed him. I sang him to sleep.

02:08:47.544 --> 02:08:51.677
And they massacred him.
For what? For honour!

02:08:53.591 --> 02:08:56.550
Fuck honour! I want my son back!

02:09:15.405 --> 02:09:17.486
I don't need this.

02:09:22.996 --> 02:09:25.077
I don't need you.

02:09:27.667 --> 02:09:29.903
I don't need anybody.

02:09:30.003 --> 02:09:32.084
Go on, you old fraud.

02:09:33.590 --> 02:09:36.409
Get your medal.

02:09:36.509 --> 02:09:38.970
I hope it was worth it.

02:09:44.559 --> 02:09:48.713
..and, certainly,
none more distinctly American

02:09:48.813 --> 02:09:52.759
than the two people
we honour here tonight.

02:09:52.859 --> 02:09:58.598
On behalf of the president,
it is my great pleasure

02:09:58.698 --> 02:10:04.854
to present the National Medal of the Arts
to Eddie Sparks and Dixie Leonard.

02:10:08.208 --> 02:10:11.569
Where is she?
Anybody have any idea where she is?

02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:15.031
Take one and cover it. We're on one.

02:10:15.131 --> 02:10:17.461
Three, swing round
and get some audience.

02:10:59.659 --> 02:11:00.827
Bravo!

02:11:06.808 --> 02:11:09.814
I should do this well at my funeral!

02:11:14.023 --> 02:11:16.104
Seriously...

02:11:18.528 --> 02:11:20.609
This is a great honour.

02:11:22.407 --> 02:11:25.143
A great, great honour.

02:11:25.243 --> 02:11:28.563
And Dixie, she couldn't be
with us tonight.

02:11:28.663 --> 02:11:31.733
She's a little under the weather.

02:11:31.833 --> 02:11:36.749
But I know she's watching.
So hang in there, honey. We love you.

02:11:41.926 --> 02:11:46.456
We both want you to know
that we share this honour

02:11:46.556 --> 02:11:52.212
with all the young Americans
who laid down their lives

02:11:52.312 --> 02:11:55.899
for the greatest country
in all the world.

02:12:06.117 --> 02:12:08.613
On the beaches of Normandy...

02:12:09.996 --> 02:12:12.077
the Philippines...

02:12:13.458 --> 02:12:15.539
Korea...

02:12:16.169 --> 02:12:18.250
Vietnam...

02:12:29.515 --> 02:12:33.304
Come on. Eddie, what? Let's go.
Stand by with a commercial.

02:12:35.355 --> 02:12:37.436
Vietnam...

02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:42.441
Vietnam...

02:12:46.532 --> 02:12:50.203
A small... A small fire base on...

02:12:56.459 --> 02:12:59.963
Christmas Day, 1969.

02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:06.381
They...

02:13:11.808 --> 02:13:14.933
They just came at us out of the sun.

02:13:21.192 --> 02:13:24.696
And we lost our boy.

02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:34.616
To tell you the truth, I...

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.496
I haven't been sleeping so good,

02:13:42.338 --> 02:13:44.799
Not so good,

02:13:47.343 --> 02:13:51.891
Because I loved him
like he was my own son.

02:13:56.144 --> 02:13:59.767
I loved him very, very much,

02:14:02.901 --> 02:14:04.982
Danny... I...

02:14:24.422 --> 02:14:27.298
Here she is. I need the spots on her.

02:14:43.358 --> 02:14:45.439
Oh, how great!

02:14:53.826 --> 02:14:56.521
Pipe down, pipe down, will you?

02:15:04.546 --> 02:15:06.627
You know, when I...

02:15:07.507 --> 02:15:10.869
When I first met him, he was nothing.

02:15:11.469 --> 02:15:13.246
Doing it single.

02:15:13.346 --> 02:15:15.427
Bad suit.

02:15:16.599 --> 02:15:19.878
Impersonations, song parodies.

02:15:19.978 --> 02:15:22.297
Terrible.

02:15:22.397 --> 02:15:28.136
But I saw some potential there
and I took him under my wing,

02:15:28.236 --> 02:15:31.181
and I taught him the business.

02:15:31.281 --> 02:15:36.363
I taught him the moves,
the songs, the timing.

02:15:37.537 --> 02:15:41.789
I even taught him
how to impersonate a human being.

02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:51.493
Thank you.

02:15:51.593 --> 02:15:53.674
You're very welcome.

02:15:57.807 --> 02:15:59.888
You know...

02:16:01.227 --> 02:16:04.589
for an old broad,
you're still pretty sexy.

02:16:13.197 --> 02:16:15.279
How would you know?

02:16:16.242 --> 02:16:19.367
Well, I think I'm getting excited.

02:16:22.749 --> 02:16:25.459
Let me know when you're sure.

02:16:27.921 --> 02:16:32.575
Hey, Dixie, they gave me
a big suite upstairs.

02:16:32.674 --> 02:16:33.868
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:16:33.968 --> 02:16:36.725
And I got a big king-size bed.

02:16:39.641 --> 02:16:43.128
- You wanna lie down, Eddie?
- Is that an offer?

02:16:43.227 --> 02:16:45.355
It's a recommendation.

02:16:51.318 --> 02:16:56.349
Look at this. I'm 91 years old.
50 years I've been waiting for this chance.

02:16:56.449 --> 02:16:59.769
- Dixie, please let's go upstairs.
- What, to your room?

02:16:59.869 --> 02:17:02.689
- Yeah.
- Ohh!

02:17:02.789 --> 02:17:05.795
- And then we get undressed?
- Yeah.

02:17:06.668 --> 02:17:09.590
- And then we get into bed?
- Yeah.

02:17:10.547 --> 02:17:12.628
And then what?

02:17:23.268 --> 02:17:25.396
Maybe we'd better dance.

02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:30.091
Thank goodness she showed up.
There is a Santa Claus!

02:17:30.191 --> 02:17:32.603
Wonderful. Stand by, music.

02:17:33.653 --> 02:17:36.556
I'm coming, sweetheart. Are you ready?

02:17:36.656 --> 02:17:40.058
- Wait. I gotta find my feet.
- They're there. Trust me.

02:17:40.159 --> 02:17:42.896
- You ready now?
- Don't hurt yourself.

02:17:42.995 --> 02:17:45.356
Don't worry. And five, six...
