00:03.322 --> 00:05.603
Your husband has a genetic marker

00:05.638 --> 00:07.900
which could indicate
early onset dementia.

00:07.902 --> 00:10.603
I find it hard to believe
we could keep it secret.

00:10.605 --> 00:12.171
Do you have an
alternative proposal?

00:12.173 --> 00:14.139
I believe I could
take a blood sample,

00:14.141 --> 00:17.775
but I would need help getting it out
of the hospital into a private lab.

00:19.378 --> 00:21.080
DUNCAN: About Sandrine,
I've been thinking...

00:21.082 --> 00:23.148
Either she's gonna clip us
in person, or set us up.

00:23.150 --> 00:26.218
I'm worried our partners might try
to take us out when this is over.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.286
What made you think that
they want to get rid of us?

00:28.288 --> 00:29.387
Intuition.

00:32.859 --> 00:34.058
I had a surprise meeting today.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.360
With the Vice-President.
Really?

00:36.362 --> 00:38.696
He wanted to know if I thought
you were trustworthy.

00:38.698 --> 00:39.897
I hope you said yes.

00:39.899 --> 00:41.699
I'm a good liar.

00:41.701 --> 00:43.034
The game isn't over.

00:45.738 --> 00:48.005
WILSON: You asked me to let you
know if there was anything unusual

00:48.007 --> 00:50.307
about Duncan Carlisle's
personal or professional life.

00:50.309 --> 00:52.243
- What is it?
- His wife.

00:52.245 --> 00:55.246
Apparently she checked herself out of
the hospital last night, suddenly.

00:55.248 --> 00:58.616
Sawyer and I are leaving.
Please don't try and follow us.

00:58.618 --> 00:59.750
DUNCAN:
She's running.

00:59.752 --> 01:00.851
I'll call a friend at the Bureau.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.787
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Carlisle.

01:03.789 --> 01:05.221

01:12.030 --> 01:13.529

01:15.900 --> 01:17.333
Walk straight ahead.

01:24.441 --> 01:26.008
Walk straight.

01:29.012 --> 01:30.246
All right stop.

01:38.657 --> 01:40.790
I apologize for
the inconvenience, ma'am.

We're only doing all of this,
to make sure you're safe.

01:47.665 --> 01:49.131
There's nothing to worry about.

01:49.133 --> 01:50.499
I promise.

01:51.634 --> 01:53.502
Did my husband tell you to do this?

01:53.504 --> 01:55.070
I'm afraid I can't
comment on that, ma'am.

01:55.072 --> 01:56.471
This is a confidential matter.

01:56.473 --> 01:57.872
Confidential?

01:57.874 --> 02:00.776
Even though you work
with my husband.

02:00.778 --> 02:04.780
I need a phone.
I want to call him. Now.

02:04.782 --> 02:06.715
I can't allow that.

I got driver's license, passports,
keys to the house in Florida.

02:31.341 --> 02:32.606
I can't believe it.

02:32.608 --> 02:35.543
Duncan actually lived
up to his promise.

02:35.545 --> 02:38.011
That's good, so...

02:38.013 --> 02:40.381
I guess the second
the surgery is over,

02:40.383 --> 02:42.282
I'll just head down and meet
you guys at the new house.

02:43.885 --> 02:45.085
Great.

02:49.224 --> 02:51.725
Maybe we should think about
splitting up for a while.

02:51.727 --> 02:53.994
I mean, I could
take Jake to California.

02:53.996 --> 02:56.629
And you and Morgan
would stay in Florida.

02:56.631 --> 02:58.165
It would make it harder
for them to find us.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.267
All right.
Until things calm down.

03:01.502 --> 03:03.470
Hmm.
Who knows how long that'll take?

03:05.840 --> 03:08.641
Yeah, but, at some point, we're
going to have to accept the risk.

03:08.643 --> 03:11.143
I mean, we can't live apart forever.

03:11.145 --> 03:14.013
I know it's not ideal, but we
have to do whatever it takes

03:14.015 --> 03:15.782
to make sure the kids
are safe, right?

03:15.784 --> 03:18.017
Well, I understand that
it's complicated

03:18.019 --> 03:19.952
and the people involved
are very powerful, but...

03:19.954 --> 03:21.487
I want us to be together.

03:21.489 --> 03:23.589
Yeah. I understand.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.565

with our relationship.

to you and to herself.

- You screwed up.

She's getting as
much rest as possible.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.482
What about the first lady?

14:44.484 --> 14:46.751
I... I don't know.

14:46.753 --> 14:50.021
But I'm meeting with her later today,
so I'll discuss it with her again then.

14:50.023 --> 14:53.057
You need to do more
than discuss, Ellen.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.793
You need to convince.

14:55.795 --> 14:58.162
Getting the President's bone
marrow doesn't mean a damn thing

14:58.164 --> 15:00.198
if we can't get it
out of the hospital.

15:09.574 --> 15:10.774
You back?

15:10.776 --> 15:13.043
Yeah, traffic was light.

15:13.045 --> 15:14.811
- How'd it go with Collins?
- Good.

15:14.813 --> 15:16.580
He's something else though.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.717
Hates the government more
than anyone I ever met.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.418
I guess that's why
he's an anarchist.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.086
You answer all his questions?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.955
Yeah. Gave him the intel, too.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.523
Hospital specs,
security information.

15:28.993 --> 15:31.194
He has no clue
he's being set up, either.

15:32.797 --> 15:34.564
He really thinks he's about to

15:34.566 --> 15:35.866
change the world.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.101
- Make history.
- Good.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.003
So...

15:40.005 --> 15:41.838
What happened with Sandrine?
Why'd you call it off.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.973
Things changed.

15:43.975 --> 15:45.308
What does that mean?

15:45.310 --> 15:47.810
I needed her help.
Simple as that.

15:47.812 --> 15:49.612
I don't really want to get into it.

15:51.248 --> 15:54.250
I know we're friends and all,
but you're pushing it, man.

15:54.252 --> 15:56.352
I'm sorry, but...

15:56.354 --> 15:58.254
This thing has gotten
out of control.

15:58.256 --> 16:00.289
It was supposed
to be easy, 24 hours,

16:00.291 --> 16:01.924
in and out, nobody gets hurt.

16:03.559 --> 16:06.228
Obviously that didn't work out.

16:06.230 --> 16:09.331
Things happen.
Nothing we can do about that.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.200
Yeah, but the truth is

16:11.202 --> 16:14.069
I don't know what Dr. Sanders
is going to do tomorrow.

16:14.071 --> 16:16.205
I can't guarantee she's
going to come through,

16:16.207 --> 16:18.607
which means I can't
guarantee you'll get paid.

16:18.609 --> 16:20.842
I thought you said she was all in.

16:22.412 --> 16:24.946
She said she was, but...

16:24.948 --> 16:26.682
Who the hell knows?

16:26.684 --> 16:28.483
We don't have any control over her.

16:30.019 --> 16:32.387
Or this.

16:32.389 --> 16:35.056
That is not what I was
hoping to hear right now.

16:35.058 --> 16:37.525
If we don't succeed,
I'll make this right.

16:37.527 --> 16:38.927
I'll pay you out of my own pocket.

16:38.929 --> 16:40.929
I could probably get my hands on

16:40.931 --> 16:42.430
50 grand or so.

16:43.899 --> 16:45.366
I appreciate that.

16:45.368 --> 16:47.168
But I didn't come this far

16:47.170 --> 16:48.236
for 50 grand.

16:50.539 --> 16:51.639
So...

16:53.007 --> 16:54.875
We need to make sure

16:54.877 --> 16:56.344
Ellen does her thing.

16:57.879 --> 17:01.315
I say we dial up the pressure,
she's got one kid left, Morgan.

17:01.317 --> 17:06.252
She has to know we will put her down,
too, if she doesn't deliver.

17:06.255 --> 17:08.922
- I'll talk to her again.
- Hell with talking to her.

17:08.924 --> 17:11.023
I say we grab Morgan
and Brian right now.

17:11.026 --> 17:13.359
Cuff them to the basement wall.
Blindfold them...

17:13.362 --> 17:16.063
We can't.
They're in the hospital.

17:16.065 --> 17:18.098
- What?
- They left early this morning.

17:18.099 --> 17:20.500
Morgan had some kind of
problem with her pregnancy.

17:20.502 --> 17:22.769
She's staying overnight.

17:22.771 --> 17:24.537
You want me to go down
there, keep an eye on 'em?

17:24.539 --> 17:28.140
No, Kramer's already there.

17:28.142 --> 17:31.010
Like I said, man, I don't know
if this thing is gonna work.

17:31.012 --> 17:34.347
But the President's gonna die,
so if you want to take off now,

17:34.349 --> 17:36.616
before things go sideways,
I totally get it.

17:40.153 --> 17:41.653
Hell no.

17:41.655 --> 17:43.322
We're friends, right?

17:44.657 --> 17:45.892
For life.

17:47.327 --> 17:48.794
Then I'm not going anywhere.

17:50.964 --> 17:52.131
Good.

18:10.717 --> 18:11.983
What the hell is this?

18:11.985 --> 18:14.619
Pills. For Duncan's wife.

18:14.621 --> 18:16.021
Duncan knows what happened.

18:16.023 --> 18:18.723
Your boss took his wife and kid.

18:18.725 --> 18:20.525
So...

18:20.527 --> 18:22.360
The woman is sick.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.628
Real sick.

18:23.630 --> 18:25.630
Leukemia.
If she's off her meds,

18:25.632 --> 18:27.698
there's a good chance
she could die.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.667
I'm not a nurse.

18:29.669 --> 18:31.502
The wife dies, it's over.

18:31.504 --> 18:33.337
Duncan's going to call it off.

18:33.339 --> 18:35.139
I heard him talking.

18:35.141 --> 18:36.340
He said he's going to
demand to speak to her

18:36.342 --> 18:37.775
an hour before the surgery.

18:37.777 --> 18:39.410
And if she's not doing well,

18:39.412 --> 18:42.112
he's going to get Dr. Sanders
to forget the whole damn thing.

18:45.016 --> 18:46.283
Okay.

18:46.285 --> 18:47.818
I'll give her the pills.

18:54.826 --> 18:56.493
Logan took the pill bottles.

18:56.495 --> 18:59.163
Now we just need to follow
them, see where they end up.

19:25.489 --> 19:27.256
That's okay, Sawyer.

19:27.258 --> 19:29.959
These men are just
trying to keep us safe.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.294
From what?

19:35.098 --> 19:36.398
Your medication.

19:38.334 --> 19:40.469
- Who gave you this?
- Doesn't matter.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.307
What the hell is going on?

19:45.309 --> 19:48.143
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm not at
liberty to discuss the situation.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.612
I want a lawyer.

19:49.614 --> 19:51.446
- I have rights.
- You do.

19:51.448 --> 19:53.315
But not here. Not now.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.694
KRAMER: The tracker stopped.
That must be where they are.

20:09.865 --> 20:12.934
35 Saratoga Drive.

20:12.936 --> 20:15.136
KRAMER:
Single family residence in Reston.

20:15.138 --> 20:17.605
Out of the way. Rural.

20:17.607 --> 20:18.773
Sounds right to me.

20:20.475 --> 20:22.844
She came through.
You got to give her that.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.112
I don't have to give her anything.

20:25.114 --> 20:26.980
She's a sellout.

20:26.982 --> 20:29.116
Lucky she's not lying face
down in a ditch right now.

20:39.061 --> 20:40.561
I didn't have a choice.

20:51.873 --> 20:53.540
How long are we going to be gone?

20:53.542 --> 20:54.841
I'm not sure.

20:56.277 --> 20:58.044
Well, as long as we're together.

20:58.046 --> 20:59.546
We're gonna make it work.

20:59.548 --> 21:01.181
It's gonna be okay.

21:01.183 --> 21:03.149
I agree.

21:03.151 --> 21:05.185
But we may have
to split up for a while,

21:05.187 --> 21:07.920
just to make it harder
for them to find us.

21:07.922 --> 21:11.857
You and I will stay together and
Jake and Mom will be together.

21:11.859 --> 21:13.126
In a different city.

21:15.428 --> 21:20.739
Sounds like Mom found out
about the affair, then.

21:22.535 --> 21:24.604
What are you talking about?

21:24.606 --> 21:26.772
Dad, I've known for a long time.

21:29.175 --> 21:30.942
I just didn't say anything.

21:53.532 --> 21:56.434
The man next to us
is staring at me.

21:56.436 --> 22:00.171
I think I might have seen his car earlier,
when we were at the gas station,

22:00.173 --> 22:02.306
do you think
that he's following us?

22:05.076 --> 22:07.111
Well. He seems harmless to me.

22:11.783 --> 22:13.283
Yeah, you're probably right.

22:14.452 --> 22:15.686
Sorry, I just...

22:15.688 --> 22:18.588
He was, like, staring right at me.

22:18.590 --> 22:20.024
I'm sure it's nothing.

22:34.472 --> 22:35.905
ARCHER:
Where are you guys goin'?

22:38.909 --> 22:43.379
Uh, I need to discuss a few things
with my contact at the Secret Service.

22:43.381 --> 22:45.414
I thought he was at the hospital.

22:45.416 --> 22:47.616
- Covering Brian and Morgan.
- He was.

22:47.618 --> 22:51.688
But I need him. When we're done
with Logan, he'll head back.

22:51.690 --> 22:53.690
ARCHER:
Yeah, okay. Good.

22:53.692 --> 22:54.891
How can I help?

22:54.893 --> 22:57.025
Keep an eye on
Collins and his men,

22:57.027 --> 22:59.562
make sure they don't do anything stupid
between now and the time of the surgery.

22:59.564 --> 23:01.664
Collins?

23:01.666 --> 23:04.300
I just left him an hour ago.
He's all set.

23:04.302 --> 23:06.134
He says he is, but he's a punk.

23:06.136 --> 23:08.637
- I don't believe a word out of his mouth.
- Right.

23:09.839 --> 23:11.674
Tough to know who
to believe these days.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.611
(CHUCKLING)

All right, uh, water, some
protein bars, anything else?

23:39.969 --> 23:41.001
Sounds good.

23:45.573 --> 23:48.776

- Hey, it's Brian.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.331
Is someone following us?

24:11.333 --> 24:12.633
Following you? No, why?

24:14.369 --> 24:16.970
I don't know, it seems like
somebody's trailing us.

24:16.972 --> 24:19.438
I'm at a rest stop off I-95.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.540

the way to the highway?

24:21.542 --> 24:22.809
Yeah, just like you said.

I gotta talk to you.

I can't believe you shot him!

26:51.827 --> 26:53.094
All right, get in.

26:57.265 --> 27:00.401
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

Someone from the

27:51.419 --> 27:53.553
They want to push up
your pre-op with the President.

- Let's do it.

Stay alert.

28:12.373 --> 28:14.505
Don't hesitate, these guys are pros.

Surgery is like a vacation.

29:35.953 --> 29:39.354
No meetings. No compromises.
No reporters.

- Don't say it.

29:40.991 --> 29:43.057
Um, never crossed
my mind, sweetheart.

29:43.059 --> 29:45.126
So, I just have a few
more questions for you.

29:45.128 --> 29:47.462
Have you taken any
medication in the past week?

29:47.464 --> 29:50.431
Uh, just the usual, I take a pill
every day for my cholesterol.

29:50.433 --> 29:53.234
And no problems breathing,
no dizziness, nausea?

29:53.236 --> 29:54.569
No, I feel terrific.

29:54.571 --> 29:56.871
Good. Well, see you tomorrow.

29:56.873 --> 29:59.740
And remember, no food
or drink after midnight.

29:59.742 --> 30:00.941
Except water.

30:03.344 --> 30:05.079
You know, Ellen,

30:05.081 --> 30:06.380
I'll be honest.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.284
I hired you for political reasons.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.753
It was a shameless publicity stunt.

30:12.755 --> 30:14.321
I wanted a woman.

30:14.323 --> 30:16.423
Someone at a public hospital.

30:16.425 --> 30:18.425
But it turns out to have
been a good decision,

30:18.427 --> 30:20.527
so I want to say thank you
for being so understanding.

30:20.529 --> 30:22.729

Thank you, sir.

(DOOR CLOSING)

30:33.842 --> 30:35.922
My husband might
have been a bit glib

30:36.000 --> 30:38.459
with respect to your question
about medications.

30:38.494 --> 30:39.579
Excuse me?

30:39.581 --> 30:43.449
In addition to taking pills for
cholesterol, he also takes pills

30:43.451 --> 30:45.719
for his libido.

30:45.721 --> 30:48.821
Right. Very common.

30:48.823 --> 30:51.557
I presume if he took one last night,

30:51.559 --> 30:53.158
or the night before,

30:53.160 --> 30:55.160
it wouldn't cause any complications.

30:55.162 --> 30:59.932
No, but, uh, you would wanna make sure
he doesn't take one this evening.

30:59.934 --> 31:01.033
Right.

31:02.202 --> 31:04.803
I'll notify his mistress.

Please, his infidelity is

to the conversation we had yesterday?

31:14.681 --> 31:16.615
About the genetic
marker for dementia?

31:16.617 --> 31:19.417
Yeah, because I feel very
uncomfortable about it all.

Because, as I said, I imagined it something
you would wanna keep off the record.

31:27.728 --> 31:30.562
So I came to you first, but I
realize that was a mistake.

31:30.564 --> 31:32.530
And I apologize.

31:33.766 --> 31:35.166
Would you like some tea?

Drop your weapons. Now.

34:12.553 --> 34:14.788
All right, look, let's just relax.

34:14.790 --> 34:19.058
I don't know if you guys know this,
but, uh, we're all on the same side.

34:19.060 --> 34:20.627
I'm not gonna ask you again.

34:20.629 --> 34:22.094
Drop your weapon.

34:22.096 --> 34:24.362
I'm workin' for your boss,
Colonel Blair.

34:24.364 --> 34:26.966
- You got three seconds.
- DUNCAN: You might wanna call him.

34:28.402 --> 34:31.603
- One, two...
- Okay. Okay.

34:31.605 --> 34:35.074
Weapons are goin' down.
No need to get excited.

35:10.922 --> 35:12.789
DUNCAN: The house is empty.
They're gone.

35:12.791 --> 35:15.625
I saw the pill bottles
in the bedroom, but that's it.

35:15.627 --> 35:17.919
They must have found the chip.
They knew we were tracking them,

35:17.953 --> 35:20.067
so they got your wife and kid
the hell out of here.

35:20.068 --> 35:21.514
Now, what?

35:21.555 --> 35:23.805
Any idea where your friends
might have taken them?

35:23.840 --> 35:25.834
No. They're not my friends.

35:25.836 --> 35:27.970
Your employer?

35:27.972 --> 35:29.671
Is that more accurate?

35:29.673 --> 35:32.873
In case you hadn't noticed,
I just saved your ass.

35:32.875 --> 35:34.175
That's right.

35:35.611 --> 35:38.045
Look, I could go back
and talk to Logan again,

35:38.047 --> 35:40.982
but my guess is that he'll
put a bullet in my head.

35:40.984 --> 35:42.617
Someone found the chip.

35:42.619 --> 35:44.185
He already knows I set him up.

35:46.021 --> 35:48.388
- How do you wanna do this?
- What do you mean?

35:48.390 --> 35:50.825
I can't change what happened.

35:50.827 --> 35:54.996
So we can either keep doing this
dance, or we can call it even.

35:54.998 --> 35:56.530
And go our separate ways.

35:56.532 --> 35:57.598
I think that's a good idea.

36:03.638 --> 36:05.005
Thanks for helping out.

36:06.608 --> 36:08.142
I didn't do it for you.

36:27.094 --> 36:29.195
My inclination is to do more testing.

36:29.197 --> 36:33.366
But at the same time, I don't
want to alarm the President.

36:33.368 --> 36:35.334
Unless I actually know
there's something wrong.

36:35.336 --> 36:39.172
Or, I know of an effective treatment
to stave off the disease.

36:39.174 --> 36:41.774
Well, I'm not an expert,

36:41.776 --> 36:45.144
but I do believe there are real
benefits to early detection.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.381
Right.

36:48.383 --> 36:52.885
Good, so the only issue is, really,
whether to alert the President.

36:52.887 --> 36:55.954
Which means alerting the
White House physician.

36:57.957 --> 36:59.191
We keep this private.

36:59.193 --> 37:00.559
For now. Just you and me.

37:00.561 --> 37:02.027
Okay.

37:02.029 --> 37:03.829
How do I get the blood sample?

37:03.831 --> 37:07.800
Well, when the surgery is over, I'll have
someone bring you into the operating room,

37:07.802 --> 37:09.334
and I'll hand it to you.

- Married to the President.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.964
She's involved in this, too?

37:39.966 --> 37:41.532
It sure looks that way.

37:56.748 --> 37:59.916
I know we've never
officially met, but...

37:59.918 --> 38:01.084
I'm late for a meeting.

38:01.086 --> 38:02.219
With who, Colonel Blair?

38:03.921 --> 38:05.122
Excuse me?

38:05.124 --> 38:07.090
I'm Special Agent Duncan Carlisle.

38:11.195 --> 38:12.328
Well.

38:14.098 --> 38:16.266
How can I help you,
Agent Carlisle?

38:16.268 --> 38:18.067
I want my wife and daughter back.

38:18.069 --> 38:19.736
What are you talking about?

38:19.738 --> 38:22.572
(GASPING) I want my wife and
daughter back, tonight.

38:22.574 --> 38:25.375
Calm down, okay?
I'm willing to help you...

38:25.377 --> 38:27.310
Then stop pretending
you're innocent.

38:27.312 --> 38:30.079
I don't know anything about
your wife and daughter, okay?

38:30.081 --> 38:33.348
I swear. Blair just said that he
needed my house for a few days.

38:33.350 --> 38:35.450
That's it, that's all he said.

38:35.452 --> 38:39.321
You need to call Blair right now and tell
him to release my wife and daughter.

38:39.323 --> 38:41.791
He won't do it.
He's too nervous.

38:41.793 --> 38:43.625
About the President...

38:43.627 --> 38:45.627
You.

38:45.629 --> 38:46.829
Me.

38:46.831 --> 38:48.230
What the hell are
you talking about?

38:49.499 --> 38:51.966
Blair doesn't trust me anymore.

It means...

Your enemy is my enemy.

39:10.752 --> 39:12.553

plays out tomorrow,

He's gonna kill you,
and extort me.

Unless...

39:23.933 --> 39:25.199
Unless what?

39:30.972 --> 39:32.973
- Are you suggesting that we...
- Yes.

39:35.377 --> 39:37.277
(TIRES SCREECHING)

39:41.249 --> 39:43.050

40:11.178 --> 40:13.445
I know I can't
justify what happened.

40:16.884 --> 40:19.352
And I know you'll never
believe another word I say.

40:20.587 --> 40:24.123
But I just want to tell you,
that I'm sorry.

40:26.026 --> 40:28.894

And that I care about you.

He said if I played ball,
he would help us escape.

40:49.383 --> 40:51.950
And I never wanted to get involved.

40:51.952 --> 40:53.285
But I felt trapped.

40:58.157 --> 40:59.391
I believe you.

41:02.861 --> 41:05.095
But you need to get
the hell out of here.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.633

41:10.268 --> 41:11.969
they'll be gunning for you.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.405
(DOOR OPENING)
I know.

41:19.877 --> 41:22.646
Don't worry. I was just leaving.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.581
Hold up.

41:24.583 --> 41:28.919
I know we said we were even,
but, I still need your help.

With what?

41:32.591 --> 41:34.123
Killing Blair.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.792
Who's that?

41:35.794 --> 41:37.393
The man in charge.

42:00.217 --> 42:01.284
This is it.

said anything about

42:17.434 --> 42:18.501
Of course.

42:20.370 --> 42:21.804

42:23.373 --> 42:25.940
I mean, I love Mom...

but I also know that...

42:29.046 --> 42:31.346
things happen and people grow apart.

42:34.817 --> 42:36.751
It's... It's not her fault.

42:36.753 --> 42:38.720
What I did was wrong.

42:38.722 --> 42:41.623
I feel horrible about it
every day.

42:41.625 --> 42:44.025
I let you guys down.

42:44.027 --> 42:46.060
You made a mistake.

42:46.062 --> 42:47.929
That doesn't mean you let us down.
