WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:08.666
It's quite
a piece of land you got.

00:08.750 --> 00:09.666
There's something kind of

00:09.791 --> 00:11.666
special out here, you know?

00:12.750 --> 00:14.166
Fuck!

00:16.375 --> 00:17.875
Your west pasture's
gonna be mine.

00:17.958 --> 00:20.625
And the goddamn
State of Wyoming says so.

00:20.708 --> 00:22.750
- Why west?
- You tell me.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.708
- What would you sell
this ranch for?
- I wouldn't.

00:28.375 --> 00:29.750
- About my dad

00:29.833 --> 00:31.583
going after your land?

00:31.666 --> 00:33.916
We'll take everything you got.

00:35.791 --> 00:37.166
Dear God,

00:37.250 --> 00:39.750
we ask that
You show us the way here.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.916
'Cause we're in trouble.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.541
- Where's the body?
- The body's gone.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.333
That's all there is to know.

00:46.416 --> 00:48.250
Something's
happening here.

00:48.333 --> 00:49.583
Something bigger
than you and me.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.833
You died two years ago.

01:04.708 --> 01:07.708
First there was a storm
of carbon and molten rock.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.833
And that begat granite and soil.

01:12.916 --> 01:15.583
Then land shook
and cracked and rose

01:15.666 --> 01:18.125
till it spiked the sky.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.458
And forests grew and died.

01:20.541 --> 01:23.041
And grew a hundred times again.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.541
And people grew and died.

01:25.625 --> 01:28.000
And grew a hundred times again.

01:28.083 --> 01:31.791
There were storms and seasons,
and fences and blood.

01:31.875 --> 01:35.000
Wonder and vengeance and regret.

01:35.083 --> 01:38.166
And the land and the sky
didn't give two shits.

02:09.041 --> 02:12.541
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:14.125 --> 02:15.541
I can't sleep.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.125
Come on.

02:25.208 --> 02:26.958
You know...

02:28.958 --> 02:31.500
- ...I didn't have
ice cream until I was...
- Ten years old.

02:31.583 --> 02:34.791
Yeah, you've mentioned it
a couple hundred times.

02:34.875 --> 02:36.666
Sorry.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.708
That's what old people do,
isn't it?

02:38.791 --> 02:40.333
Repeat themselves.

02:40.416 --> 02:42.583
You're not that old.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.125
Right.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.125
Hmm.

02:50.083 --> 02:54.166
The other morning, at breakfast,

02:54.250 --> 02:56.083
why was your leg bleeding?

02:59.583 --> 03:01.708
Well...

03:01.791 --> 03:04.000
Cut it on a fence.

03:07.708 --> 03:09.916
I don't believe that.

03:15.625 --> 03:18.500
D-Money back
with you on Drive Time.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.500
And I am so sick
of talking about this,

03:20.583 --> 03:22.833
but we got to talk about it.
The quarterback situation...

03:22.916 --> 03:24.500
Come on.

03:24.583 --> 03:28.291
...for the Denver Broncos
once again looks abysmal.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.041
And I got news for you:

03:30.125 --> 03:31.541
I don't think they're
gonna figure it out

03:31.625 --> 03:33.333
in the draft, either.
I mean, let's be honest...

03:50.708 --> 03:52.583
Morning, Gladys.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.083
The other day you said
bring one of these by, so...

03:55.166 --> 03:56.375
here it is.

03:57.416 --> 03:58.833
Thanks.

04:00.916 --> 04:02.458
Everything all right, Gladys?

04:08.208 --> 04:10.916
Good. That's good.

04:12.916 --> 04:14.750
Hey, you ever listen
to this yahoo D-Money

04:14.833 --> 04:17.750
go on about the Broncos
on the radio?

04:17.875 --> 04:20.250
The guy talks like
he can see the future.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.083
You sure everything's all right?

04:27.166 --> 04:28.583
Hey!

04:28.666 --> 04:30.250
Okay, settle down.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.208
- He's got a gun!
- I know.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.791
- Drop it.

04:36.208 --> 04:38.125
It's okay, I got it!

04:38.208 --> 04:39.708
Get the hell off me!

04:39.791 --> 04:40.916
I will break your arm
if I have to.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.208
The fuck you will!

04:44.458 --> 04:47.666
- I will break your arm!
- Fuck you!

04:51.666 --> 04:55.375
Well, I told you, didn't I?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.125
This is bullshit.

05:02.208 --> 05:04.041
It's not like
I robbed the place.

05:04.125 --> 05:07.125
For the record, that's why
they call it attempted robbery.

05:07.208 --> 05:08.916
Y'all need to be
concerning yourselves

05:09.000 --> 05:11.208
about the real trouble
around here.

05:11.291 --> 05:12.583
And what's that?

05:12.666 --> 05:16.625
People just-- poof--
disappearing.

05:16.708 --> 05:20.458
Like, about six months ago,
my cousin,

05:20.541 --> 05:25.208
he just disappeared
for six seconds.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.666
He was here,

05:27.750 --> 05:31.166
and then gone.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.916
By any chance was he a fan of
methamphetamine like yourself?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.333
No.

05:37.416 --> 05:41.875
And I heard some guy
on the Tillerson ranch,

05:41.958 --> 05:44.666
he disappeared too,
just last week.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.916
Trevor something.

05:47.958 --> 05:49.875
Thanks for the tip.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.541
Morning.

05:52.625 --> 05:53.875
Think you could process
my friend here?

05:53.958 --> 05:55.291
Be careful with his arm.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.125
And don't let him disappear.

05:57.208 --> 05:59.250
Morning.
Heard about your heroics

05:59.333 --> 06:00.875
at the gas station this morning.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.791
- Nice work.
- Morning. Thanks.

06:02.875 --> 06:04.625
- Hey, so you know...
- Do me a favor
and call Luke Tillerson,

06:04.708 --> 06:06.083
see if there's any news
about Trevor.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.291
- Will do. So, also...
- Please call over to the lab

06:08.375 --> 06:09.833
and see if they got anything yet
off that buckle he gave us.

06:09.916 --> 06:11.958
Copy that.
Anyway, so Trudy Cole...

06:12.041 --> 06:14.041
...they turn
and see a dozen cruisers

06:14.125 --> 06:16.875
pursuing their canine,
who's sprinting toward them

06:16.958 --> 06:18.250
with the chief's umbrella
in his mouth.

06:19.791 --> 06:23.166
My K9 plan is a little
different, but necessary.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.333
If it isn't the Lander chief
of police, right here in Wabang.

06:26.416 --> 06:28.750
Joy, good to see you.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.000
So, what do you think, guys?

06:30.083 --> 06:32.208
How's Trudy's K9 plan
compared to mine?

06:34.666 --> 06:36.625
Come on, now, you can answer.

06:36.708 --> 06:39.541
It's a free country,
still, barely.

06:39.625 --> 06:43.041
Uh, both are pretty good.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.250
Hear that, Trudy?

06:44.333 --> 06:46.291
Mark likes my plan better.
Thanks, Mark.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.291
Got a second to talk, Joy?

06:48.375 --> 06:50.458
Come on, Trudy,
this isn't the first time

06:50.541 --> 06:54.041
Trevor's whereabouts
have been, you know, unknown.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.083
Sure, but apparently
Luke and Billy

06:56.166 --> 06:59.625
went over to the Abbotts'
after they were at the Pit Bar.

06:59.708 --> 07:02.000
I'm up to date on Luke's theory
of the case.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.916
Now, if you want
to go look for Trevor

07:04.000 --> 07:06.208
down in Lander, then please do.

07:06.291 --> 07:09.291
Keep me informed.
I'll do likewise.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.875
And no hard feelings, okay?

07:10.958 --> 07:15.708
I really do look forward to us
working together when I win.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.750
Have it your way.

07:21.833 --> 07:24.375
Only makes things easier for me.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.416
You take care now, Joy.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.125
Trudy's a damn girl's name.

07:38.208 --> 07:41.000
- [

07:41.083 --> 07:44.333
Four days, Dad.
It's been four days.

07:44.416 --> 07:46.166
The phone company said
there's been no calls

07:46.250 --> 07:48.041
from his phone since that night.

07:48.125 --> 07:49.041
I called the credit card
company,

07:49.125 --> 07:50.125
they won't let me get...

07:50.208 --> 07:52.125
Trevor ain't
a child, Luke.

07:52.208 --> 07:55.875
So untwist your panties
for a heartbeat, all right?

07:58.250 --> 08:00.291
Luke's right to be worried, Dad.

08:02.291 --> 08:03.625
Just doesn't feel right.

08:07.375 --> 08:10.791
Make Royal an offer
for his west pasture.

08:10.875 --> 08:12.708
An offer?

08:12.791 --> 08:14.541
The assessor's gonna rule
in our favor.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.333
He's already bought and paid
for, why would we make him

08:16.416 --> 08:18.541
- an offer?
- Offer him a million for it.

08:18.625 --> 08:20.333
A million dollars?

08:20.416 --> 08:22.208
- The hearing's next month.
- Hearings!

08:22.291 --> 08:25.500
Hearings. You know what animals
got the best hearings?

08:25.583 --> 08:28.416
Bats. Bats and moths.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.458
They bounce sound off of walls
and each other.

08:30.541 --> 08:32.916
Echolocation.
That's also how they mate.

08:33.041 --> 08:35.375
Ultrasonic sexual communication.

08:38.625 --> 08:41.166
They are
remarkable creatures.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.541
Remarkable.

08:47.666 --> 08:50.750
Nothing.
You couldn't hear it with a...

08:55.000 --> 08:58.750
Oh, shit!
Billy, what are those things?

09:03.208 --> 09:04.750
A megaphone?

09:04.833 --> 09:06.458
Yeah.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.125
Make him the offer.

09:21.541 --> 09:23.541
I want that land.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.500
Why?

09:30.500 --> 09:31.541
Oh, Jesus.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.041
You sound just like your mother.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.750
Billy, go tell Carol
to fix me a Clamato.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.500
Take your brother with you.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.916
That son of a bitch
cares more about

09:59.000 --> 10:01.666
some worthless fucking pasture
than his own son.

10:01.750 --> 10:04.791
- He must feel something.

10:06.791 --> 10:08.208
I'm sorry, Luke.

10:10.166 --> 10:12.541
I'm not offering him shit.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.416
- [

12:13.166 --> 12:14.916
Sorry. Hi.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.500
I'm here to pick up a
prescription for Autumn Rivers.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.250
It's for lamotrigine.
It should've been called in...

12:19.333 --> 12:20.541
Yep. Got it right here.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.041
Have you taken this before?
Because if not,

12:24.125 --> 12:25.916
- I need to...
- Not my first lamotrigine
rodeo.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.625
Got to stay stable.

12:48.291 --> 12:51.291
Hey, uh, is Royal Abbott in here
by any chance?

12:51.375 --> 12:53.625
I saw his truck parked outside.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.625
I'm Perry Abbott.

12:56.708 --> 12:57.833
Royal's my dad.

12:57.916 --> 13:00.750
Hi. I'm Autumn.

13:00.833 --> 13:03.416
I'm camping on your land.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.250
Right.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.500
Yeah, yeah.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.333
My dad mentioned you.

13:09.416 --> 13:11.416
This is what I call
a great place to have a beer

13:11.500 --> 13:12.958
in the middle of the day.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.500
Hell yes to that.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.166
- I'll have what he's having.
- Coming right up.

13:19.250 --> 13:22.250
So, uh...

13:24.166 --> 13:26.291
...how long are you planning
on staying around here,

13:26.375 --> 13:28.000
on our land?

13:29.083 --> 13:30.833
Hmm, I'm not really sure.

13:30.916 --> 13:33.333
- Not yet, at least.
- Why's that?

13:34.333 --> 13:37.083
I'm still waiting for my sign.

13:39.791 --> 13:42.500
Well, um, the thing is, uh,

13:42.583 --> 13:43.958
- Autumn...
- Mm.

13:44.041 --> 13:47.791
...thing is, um... well...

13:47.875 --> 13:51.208
- My family's...
- How long you been married?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.458
I just saw the ring
on your finger.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.708
A little over ten years.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.958
Oh, that's amazing.

14:07.916 --> 14:10.750
She's missing.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.250
My wife.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.333
Nine months now.

14:17.666 --> 14:19.875
No one knows anything.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.208
Perry, I want to tell you
something.

14:33.625 --> 14:34.958
For the longest time,

14:35.041 --> 14:37.875
I felt like I was
in a dark room.

14:37.958 --> 14:41.208
I'd be feeling along the wall,
searching for a light switch.

14:41.291 --> 14:44.541
And, y-you know,
you-you start to think

14:44.625 --> 14:48.125
that maybe
there's not one there.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.250
But then...

14:53.625 --> 14:54.833
...there it is.

14:59.083 --> 15:01.750
It was really nice
talking to you, Perry.

15:01.833 --> 15:03.791
Um...

15:03.875 --> 15:06.166
You tell your dad I say hi.

15:35.125 --> 15:38.541
Hey, Amy. You want a ride?

15:59.083 --> 16:01.000
You want?

16:01.083 --> 16:03.708
No. Thanks.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.916
Maybe Trevor's
with your mom somewhere?

16:21.208 --> 16:23.208
What do you mean?

17:07.708 --> 17:09.833
Mrs. Abbott?
Mrs. Abbott!

17:09.916 --> 17:11.041
Wait, wait.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.250
- You forgot this.
- Oh, thanks.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.125
- Yeah, you're welcome.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.333
Rebecca?

17:43.416 --> 17:45.708
Ow. Shit.

17:45.791 --> 17:48.833
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

17:49.916 --> 17:51.125
Fuck.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.833
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

17:55.916 --> 17:59.333
Worry about yourself,
about riding tonight.

17:59.416 --> 18:01.541
It's your last shot, pal.
Keep your head on straight.

18:01.625 --> 18:03.791
- My head?
- What's that?

18:03.875 --> 18:05.375
What about you?

18:05.458 --> 18:07.166
Moving the cattle
for no good reason and...

18:07.250 --> 18:09.166
Sorry, you-you making
the decisions around here now?

18:09.250 --> 18:11.333
- And what about Perry?
- What about him?

18:12.416 --> 18:14.333
No, go on.
Get it out now, Rhett,

18:14.416 --> 18:15.375
'cause if I hear you
talking this way

18:15.458 --> 18:16.833
around him or your mother...

18:16.916 --> 18:18.250
Oh, right,
can't hurt Perry's feelings.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.875
Fragile as he is.

18:20.875 --> 18:22.791
You done?

18:25.416 --> 18:27.875
Your brother's not fragile.

18:27.958 --> 18:30.000
You and him are just different.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.833
You're more like me.

18:50.666 --> 18:53.208
- Hey.

18:53.291 --> 18:54.708
You ready?

18:56.291 --> 18:57.833
I was, uh...

18:57.916 --> 19:02.083
I was praying for Rhett,
for tonight.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.500
Couldn't do it.

19:04.583 --> 19:06.583
I-I never felt that before.

19:11.666 --> 19:13.083
Okay.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.375
Did you, did you hear
what I just said?

19:17.416 --> 19:20.083
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

19:22.125 --> 19:24.125
Y-You may have made up your mind
about God a long time ago,

19:24.208 --> 19:26.458
but is it really possible
that you still don't understand

19:26.541 --> 19:29.291
that for me...

19:29.375 --> 19:31.958
I-I was at the market today,

19:32.041 --> 19:35.333
and I thought I saw Rebecca.

19:35.416 --> 19:39.083
It wasn't her, of course,
but this-this everything,

19:39.166 --> 19:42.791
it's all... I feel like...

19:45.708 --> 19:47.916
What do you,
what do you want me to say?

20:14.750 --> 20:16.541
You know,
walking over here, I saw

20:16.625 --> 20:19.833
Ricardo Olivares's daughter
Maria.

20:19.916 --> 20:22.125
She's back in town, huh?

20:22.208 --> 20:24.250
Yeah. Guess so.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.708
You guess so?

20:26.791 --> 20:31.291
I always rode better
when your mother was watching.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.333
- Figured if I won, you know...
- No, oh, my God.

20:33.416 --> 20:35.583
- Stop it. Stop, stop.
- What?

20:38.083 --> 20:39.625
Well, that's a sight.

20:39.708 --> 20:43.625
Two generations
of Amelia County rodeo greats.

20:43.708 --> 20:47.000
Sorry, Royal, can I get
a minute alone with Rhett?

20:47.083 --> 20:49.083
Can it wait
until after he rides?

20:49.166 --> 20:50.708
- Yeah, it'd be better if...
- It's about Trevor.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.333
He finally turn up?

20:53.416 --> 20:55.375
- Where, Vegas?
- Actually it's just Rhett

20:55.458 --> 20:57.500
I need to talk to,
if you don't mind.

20:59.791 --> 21:02.666
- He's just about to ride.
- And he's gonna do great.

21:02.750 --> 21:05.666
You know, the bull you got
last time was just bad luck.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.375
I'll-I'll be quick, I promise.

21:10.916 --> 21:12.750
All right, then.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.000
You feel good?

21:18.083 --> 21:19.875
Yeah.

21:19.958 --> 21:21.791
Good.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
- All right.
- Okay.

21:41.041 --> 21:42.583
What's going on?

21:42.666 --> 21:44.916
Trevor's belt buckle
was found in the parking lot

21:45.000 --> 21:46.333
over at The Pit Bar.

21:46.416 --> 21:48.208
It had some blood on it.

21:48.291 --> 21:50.916
We had it tested and it came
back that it was your blood.

21:51.958 --> 21:53.166
What?

21:53.250 --> 21:55.041
That's... I mean,
how does that even...

21:55.125 --> 21:59.000
Your DNA is in the state system
from a DUI you had last year.

21:59.083 --> 22:01.791
Any idea why your blood
was on that buckle?

22:04.500 --> 22:06.875
I don't know what to tell you.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.583
I really don't.
I mean, I was there that night,

22:09.666 --> 22:13.000
but... that's it.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.166
Okay.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.291
Thanks.

22:17.375 --> 22:20.166
Good luck out there.

22:32.291 --> 22:36.083
They found Trevor's belt buckle.
Has my blood on it.

22:45.291 --> 22:47.291
All right, folks,
let's hear it for Wabang's own,

22:47.375 --> 22:49.041
Rhett Abbott,
now in fourth place

22:49.125 --> 22:51.625
before his third
and final ride,

22:51.708 --> 22:53.958
- looking to jump to the top...
- Go Uncle Rhett!

22:54.041 --> 22:55.625
...of the leaderboard tonight.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.750
And I think this hometown
cowboy can do it, folks.

22:57.833 --> 22:59.250
Come on, Rhett.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.166
He's something special.

23:05.916 --> 23:08.041
Everything okay?

23:08.125 --> 23:09.458
Yeah.

23:14.291 --> 23:15.708
You good?

23:54.458 --> 23:55.916
- Hold on!

23:58.791 --> 24:00.041
You got it! Hold on!

24:13.333 --> 24:16.375
- Yeah! Yeah!

24:30.750 --> 24:32.375
Yeah, Rhett!

24:35.125 --> 24:37.708
- Why'd you leave grad school?
- I just wasn't
as focused

24:37.791 --> 24:41.166
as I should have been,
or at least as I was in college.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.791
My mom isn't cutting me
any slack, that's for sure.

24:43.875 --> 24:45.958
It's like she thinks if she's
enough of a constant bitch,

24:46.041 --> 24:47.875
I'll reenroll just
to get away from her.

24:47.958 --> 24:51.458
Far as I'm concerned, you
should stay right where you are.

24:51.541 --> 24:52.583
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

24:52.666 --> 24:54.875
I'm not sure I agree
with you on that.

24:54.958 --> 24:57.250
Well, it'll grow on you.

24:57.333 --> 24:59.333
Can we get two more, please?

25:00.708 --> 25:02.833
What you got there?

25:02.916 --> 25:04.833
Oh, painkillers.

25:04.916 --> 25:06.750
Bull rider's best friend.

25:06.833 --> 25:08.166
I bet.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.625
- Got to be careful with those.
- Oh, yeah.

25:10.708 --> 25:13.166
I know it. I know it.

25:22.208 --> 25:24.458
Why didn't you ever
ask me out in high school?

25:24.541 --> 25:28.041
Or, you know, ever?

25:28.125 --> 25:30.750
Didn't think you'd say yes.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.666
Oh, I wouldn't have.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.250
You want to dance with me?

25:43.333 --> 25:45.375
Can you really dance?

25:45.458 --> 25:48.250
Well, I'm not drunk.

25:48.333 --> 25:50.541
No, I mean, can you
dance at all? Even sober?

25:50.625 --> 25:53.083
Well, definitely not sober.

25:55.041 --> 25:56.458
Ooh.

25:56.541 --> 25:57.833
- Sorry.
- Whoa, hey.

25:57.916 --> 25:59.958
Hey, hey. Where you going, pal?

26:00.041 --> 26:01.000
I think you owe
somebody an apology.

26:01.083 --> 26:02.541
It's all right, Rhett. I'm fine.

26:02.625 --> 26:04.833
Do yourself a favor, son,
and sit back down.

26:04.916 --> 26:06.041
I told her I was sorry.

26:06.125 --> 26:07.500
Well, tell her again.

26:07.583 --> 26:10.166
I'm not much
for repeating myself.

26:10.250 --> 26:11.916
Well, let's change that.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.708
Just give me a second,
hold on a second here.

26:16.791 --> 26:18.500
- Wait, wait. Hey.

26:19.916 --> 26:22.833
- You okay, there?
- You impressed yet?

26:25.500 --> 26:26.833
Let's get you home.

26:26.916 --> 26:28.500
All right.

26:28.583 --> 26:30.916
- Come on.
- Let's get me home.

26:33.791 --> 26:36.416
For what it's worth,
I would've still taken that guy.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.125
Oh, yeah, anyone could see that.

26:39.916 --> 26:42.333
I'll call you tomorrow?

26:45.750 --> 26:48.333
Mm-hmm.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.625
Mm.

27:10.416 --> 27:12.541
Okay. Mm.

27:15.916 --> 27:18.541
Good night, Rhett.

27:27.750 --> 27:29.000
Bye.

27:53.125 --> 27:54.875
What the hell?

27:57.375 --> 27:59.458
You're pissing on my car, Rhett.

27:59.541 --> 28:02.208
Oh, shit, I'm sorry. I didn't...

28:02.291 --> 28:03.416
I didn't realize.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.375
Well, stop pissing then.

28:05.458 --> 28:07.916
Uh...

28:09.416 --> 28:12.333
Not so easy to turn off
the faucet after riding bulls.

28:12.416 --> 28:14.291
You think that's funny?

28:14.375 --> 28:16.166
Oh, come on,
it's a little funny.

28:19.250 --> 28:22.041
I have to go out and see
Frank Harlan tomorrow morning.

28:22.125 --> 28:24.291
Oh, boy. About what?

28:24.375 --> 28:26.041
Got to kiss the ring
of the Chamber of Commerce

28:26.125 --> 28:29.541
if you want to be sheriff
in Amelia County.

28:29.625 --> 28:32.458
You think if I'm sheriff
they'll give me a new desk?

28:41.083 --> 28:42.875
Hey, there.

28:42.958 --> 28:44.958
Did some celebrating
tonight, huh?

28:47.625 --> 28:49.833
The kind that required taking
a leak on Mark's cruiser?

28:50.875 --> 28:52.000
It was an accident.

28:52.083 --> 28:53.708
It's pretty dumb is what it was.

28:56.333 --> 28:57.791
But seeing as you rode
so well tonight,

28:57.875 --> 29:00.750
I'm gonna let this one slide.

29:00.833 --> 29:02.666
You call someone yet
to come for you?

29:05.791 --> 29:07.208
Yeah.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.583
So here's the deal, Rhett.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.333
Starting tomorrow,
we're gonna be talking

29:30.416 --> 29:32.583
to everyone who was
at The Pit Bar that night.

29:33.625 --> 29:35.333
And please believe me
when I tell you

29:35.416 --> 29:38.208
that if your memory is gonna
get any better about things,

29:38.291 --> 29:40.500
it'd be way, way better for you

29:40.583 --> 29:43.666
if that happened,
like, right away.

29:43.750 --> 29:46.666
Because, trust me,

29:46.750 --> 29:51.208
whatever happened,
it's gonna come out.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.083
Always does.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.041
Always.

29:59.958 --> 30:01.625
Okay.

30:03.416 --> 30:04.833
Okay, Rhett.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.458
Okay, look.

30:11.750 --> 30:17.291
Trevor and I got into a scuffle
out in the parking lot.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.291
He was drunk, popping off.

30:19.375 --> 30:21.166
I gave him a bloody nose,
that was it.

30:21.250 --> 30:24.208
He was on his feet yelling at me

30:24.291 --> 30:26.166
as I walked back in the bar.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.375
And that was all of it.

30:32.500 --> 30:35.125
Why not tell me that
straight away?

30:35.208 --> 30:38.416
Because Luke's been crazy
about this from the get.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.791
I mean, he tell you
about coming to our house,

30:40.875 --> 30:42.416
driving through our fence.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.250
I should have told you.

30:52.875 --> 30:55.208
Royal's here.

30:55.291 --> 30:57.291
Have him wait outside.

31:03.666 --> 31:07.875
Anyone else see this scuffle?

31:07.958 --> 31:10.583
Was anyone in the lot
with you two?

31:14.500 --> 31:15.708
No.

31:17.708 --> 31:19.708
No, it was just me and Trev.

31:26.666 --> 31:27.958
Wait here.

31:28.041 --> 31:29.458
- Joy's getting Rhett.
- Okay.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.500
Hiya, Royal.

32:13.583 --> 32:16.500
- Joy.
- He's all yours.

32:16.583 --> 32:18.500
Lucky me.

32:18.583 --> 32:20.000
Come on.

32:32.625 --> 32:36.166
I'm gonna tell you something,

32:36.250 --> 32:39.500
but you got to keep it
to yourself.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.583
Okay.

32:44.916 --> 32:49.250
I've always told you,
and everybody else,

32:49.333 --> 32:53.583
that my parents died
when I was a kid.

32:53.666 --> 32:56.375
That's only part true.

32:56.458 --> 33:00.000
My dad died, but not my mom.

33:01.083 --> 33:03.750
After my dad, I was...

33:03.833 --> 33:06.666
I was real upset.

33:08.833 --> 33:10.750
And I left.

33:10.833 --> 33:13.166
I ran away.

33:13.250 --> 33:15.250
I never went back.

33:18.166 --> 33:20.166
Never saw my mother.

33:22.375 --> 33:25.291
Or my sister.

33:25.375 --> 33:27.125
Mm-mm.

33:27.208 --> 33:29.208
Yeah, I had a sister.

33:31.875 --> 33:33.875
A younger sister.

33:39.416 --> 33:41.625
I never saw
either of them again.

35:06.583 --> 35:09.458
Okay, well, that's my spiel.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.500
- Your what?

35:11.583 --> 35:13.166
Why I'm running for sheriff.

35:13.250 --> 35:16.291
I know you always
supported Burt.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.000
I'm hoping
you'll support me, too.

35:24.333 --> 35:25.666
Hmm.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.875
Last week, one of the fellas
that works for me

35:30.958 --> 35:34.375
was down near the south end
of my property,

35:34.458 --> 35:38.083
about a quarter mile
up the mountain.

35:38.166 --> 35:43.208
There are these caves
around there.

35:43.291 --> 35:50.041
Anyway, he's down there
and he hears a weird noise.

35:51.541 --> 35:54.541
Like, from an animal.

35:54.625 --> 35:56.625
So he goes to check it out...

35:58.625 --> 36:01.708
...and he hears this rumble.

36:05.958 --> 36:09.875
It's coming from the mouth
of one of these caves.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.750
So he gets his torch out,
heads in.

36:16.916 --> 36:22.458
He shines his light
deeper still,

36:22.541 --> 36:24.375
and he sees.

36:25.416 --> 36:26.666
What?

36:26.750 --> 36:29.541
Mastodon.

36:29.625 --> 36:35.583
Prehistoric elephant, basically.

36:35.666 --> 36:39.125
Inhabited this area
during the late Pliocene

36:39.208 --> 36:43.041
up to their extinction
at the end of the Pleistocene.

36:43.125 --> 36:45.333
Those are eras.

36:45.416 --> 36:47.750
And it isn't the first time

36:47.833 --> 36:49.541
that one's been spotted
around here, either.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.208
Fur trappers used to spot them
all the time.

36:52.291 --> 36:54.208
And hunters.

36:54.291 --> 36:57.916
Of course, the Indians
got tons of stories.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.833
Sightings.

37:02.458 --> 37:07.291
So, if you're going
to be sheriff...

37:09.291 --> 37:12.875
...what are you going to do
about that?

37:39.166 --> 37:40.375
Whoa.

37:42.375 --> 37:46.583
So, uh, I was wondering,

37:46.666 --> 37:49.500
if we could sort of start over?

37:50.958 --> 37:53.250
Absolutely.

37:53.333 --> 37:55.083
I'd like that.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.083
Yeah, the other night,
in the barn,

38:00.166 --> 38:01.958
you said that you don't
remember anything

38:02.041 --> 38:04.583
from before you were
nine years old.

38:04.666 --> 38:06.291
Why?

38:06.375 --> 38:10.166
I was in some kind of accident
when I was a kid.

38:10.250 --> 38:12.541
I woke up in the hospital
in Jackson.

38:12.625 --> 38:15.250
Only thing I could remember
was my name.

38:19.208 --> 38:21.416
Why'd you push me in that hole?

38:23.916 --> 38:25.791
Maybe I just...

38:27.791 --> 38:32.208
...needed to see
what would happen.

38:37.791 --> 38:38.875
Hmm.

38:42.833 --> 38:44.833
I'm sorry, Royal.

38:47.208 --> 38:49.833
I'm happy that you came back.

38:49.916 --> 38:51.750
Truly.

38:55.958 --> 38:59.458
I need you to promise me
something,

38:59.541 --> 39:01.875
that you're not gonna
say anything,

39:01.958 --> 39:03.708
to anyone about this.

39:03.791 --> 39:06.250
You know, the hole, all of it.

39:08.250 --> 39:10.166
And that you'll stay away
from my family.

39:10.250 --> 39:13.416
'Cause they don't know
anything about this.

39:13.500 --> 39:17.291
If you can do that,
you... you can stay.

39:19.916 --> 39:24.250
I appreciate that, I do.

39:24.333 --> 39:25.958
But I'm gonna need
more than that.

39:28.250 --> 39:29.791
I need to know what happened
to you in there.

39:29.875 --> 39:31.416
All right, listen to me, okay?

39:31.500 --> 39:33.458
'Cause this is the truth.

39:33.541 --> 39:35.333
This isn't something
to be poked at,

39:35.416 --> 39:38.208
- or-or tested...
- Why the hell not?

39:40.416 --> 39:42.458
Where did you go?

39:43.541 --> 39:44.458
What did you see?

39:44.541 --> 39:47.041
- I saw this place.
- And?

39:47.125 --> 39:49.041
- It was different.
- How?

39:54.083 --> 39:56.291
Another time.

39:58.333 --> 40:00.166
What do you mean?

40:05.958 --> 40:07.750
The past?

40:11.750 --> 40:13.583
Or the future?

40:14.666 --> 40:17.250
Holy fucking shit.

40:18.291 --> 40:21.708
Oh, my God, Royal.

40:21.791 --> 40:25.416
You traveled
through fucking time?

40:26.791 --> 40:29.208
Did you see me?

40:37.916 --> 40:40.458
Stay quiet about
what you've seen,

40:40.541 --> 40:42.958
and you can stay,

40:43.041 --> 40:47.791
and we'll keep talking,
about all of it.

40:47.875 --> 40:50.208
You have my word.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.541
Okay, Royal.

40:54.625 --> 40:56.250
Okay.

41:06.708 --> 41:08.875
Mastodon.

41:19.958 --> 41:21.583
Something wrong?

41:25.916 --> 41:27.166
No.

41:28.583 --> 41:31.083
"The Man"]

41:32.458 --> 41:33.583
What...?

41:42.041 --> 41:43.958
Going for a hike, Grandma!

41:48.958 --> 41:50.916
Hey,
how'd it go with Frank?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Fine. Weird.

41:53.083 --> 41:54.458
Yeah, here, too.

41:54.541 --> 41:55.875
You're not gonna believe this,

41:55.958 --> 41:57.458
but we've got all kinds
of calls coming in

41:57.541 --> 41:59.166
about people seeing
a mountain disappear.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.208
Hmm?

42:00.291 --> 42:01.541
- A what?
- Joy!

42:02.791 --> 42:04.791
We need to talk.

42:11.541 --> 42:12.958
Whose blood's on that buckle?

42:13.041 --> 42:15.166
- Well, we're still
waiting for...
- Bullshit!

42:15.250 --> 42:18.291
I know it's Rhett Abbott's.
And so do you.

42:50.166 --> 42:53.791
I saw Trevor
on the mountain.

42:53.875 --> 42:55.833
On the trail. I think he's dead.

43:01.166 --> 43:03.125
Arrest him for what?

43:03.208 --> 43:06.458
We are investigating,
and this buckle...

43:11.041 --> 43:13.333
Goddamn it, it's Rhett's blood.

43:16.208 --> 43:19.333
Joy, it's Royal.

43:19.416 --> 43:22.625
Amy was out hiking.
She found Trevor.

43:22.708 --> 43:23.916
He's dead.

43:25.666 --> 43:26.791
What?

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
"Death Don't Have No Mercy]
