00:00.027 --> 00:01.426
Previously on Cardinal.

00:01.460 --> 00:02.596
I found a note in her bag.

00:02.630 --> 00:03.707
It's Catherine's handwriting.

00:03.731 --> 00:06.199
So this Catherine killed herself?

00:06.234 --> 00:07.234
But you're not convinced.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.568
No I am not.

00:08.603 --> 00:09.568
Anyone see you?

00:09.604 --> 00:10.871
No one's around anymore.

00:10.905 --> 00:11.938
Can we maybe hang out for

00:11.973 --> 00:13.874
more than an hour together sometime?

00:13.908 --> 00:15.342
I'm-I'm working on that.

00:15.376 --> 00:16.587
Something happened at the house.

00:16.611 --> 00:18.678
People came in and I heard gunshots.

00:19.714 --> 00:20.714
Did someone see you?

00:22.750 --> 00:24.551
Randall, we need to go to the police.

00:24.585 --> 00:25.785
Don't do anything yet.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.187
I'll figure something out.

00:27.221 --> 00:28.622
We have a situation on Island Road.

00:28.656 --> 00:29.956
I want you to take the lead.

00:29.991 --> 00:31.591
At least two people died in this house.

00:31.626 --> 00:32.926
So where are the bodies?

00:32.960 --> 00:34.127
How's your sister?

00:34.161 --> 00:35.228
She's not good.

00:35.263 --> 00:37.230
She's got a couple of
weeks left, maybe days.

00:37.265 --> 00:38.765
We need to concentrate the search

00:38.799 --> 00:39.966
for the bodies on the lake.

00:40.001 --> 00:41.612
So you think he dumped them in the water?

00:41.636 --> 00:43.470
I think they're down there.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:10.998 --> 01:15.335
Fish got to the eyes,
nose, lips and fingertips.

01:15.369 --> 01:18.471
But there should be
enough flesh on the fingers

01:18.506 --> 01:20.574
to get a workable print,

01:20.608 --> 01:22.442
if they're in the system.

01:33.454 --> 01:36.856
Okay, Victim 1, Zone
1 gunshot wound to the neck,

01:36.891 --> 01:38.525
clipping the jugular.

01:38.559 --> 01:40.627
Second shot, point blank,

01:40.661 --> 01:42.596
through the frontal bone,

01:42.630 --> 01:44.965
and exiting the parietal.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.199
Fatal.

01:59.914 --> 02:01.915
Offensive wounds on both
the victim's hands.

02:04.485 --> 02:05.719
He fought the killer.

02:05.753 --> 02:07.444
So she could escape.

02:14.428 --> 02:16.062
Victim 2. Shot in the spine,

02:16.097 --> 02:18.865
T-7, second shot,

02:18.899 --> 02:20.567
also fatal,

02:20.601 --> 02:22.793
also in the frontal bone.

02:23.838 --> 02:25.038
Any ID?

02:26.007 --> 02:27.207
No.

02:30.878 --> 02:33.213
Her wedding band matches his.

02:33.247 --> 02:34.347
They're married.

02:34.382 --> 02:35.582
And rich.

02:37.551 --> 02:39.185
Starting the Y incision.

02:40.454 --> 02:41.588
No wallets,

02:41.622 --> 02:43.256
no keys,

02:43.290 --> 02:45.125
no leads from the clothing labels.

02:47.094 --> 02:48.928
Somebody must know who they are.

03:48.355 --> 03:50.190
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

03:51.325 --> 03:52.792
Five hundred dollars?

03:52.827 --> 03:55.177
That's more than the whole car is worth.

03:56.163 --> 03:59.399
Okay, I'm-I'm gonna
have to call you back.

03:59.433 --> 04:01.267
Sam, are you out here?

04:10.177 --> 04:11.377
What on earth?

04:12.346 --> 04:14.447
Must've been a hit and run at school.

04:14.482 --> 04:16.740
It's gonna cost me a whole
week's pay to fix it.

04:18.185 --> 04:19.385
Here's your phone.

04:20.954 --> 04:22.689
You know what, keep it

04:22.723 --> 04:24.157
until you find yours.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.292
Bad week you're having.

04:26.327 --> 04:27.961
Yeah.

04:27.995 --> 04:29.195
Thanks mom.

04:29.864 --> 04:31.698
Hurry up before you miss the bus.

04:35.202 --> 04:36.676
Everything okay?

04:37.838 --> 04:39.038
Fine.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.751
I'll get them to pack it up for me.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.122
You want to have some dessert Janey?

04:56.157 --> 04:57.157
Yeah.

04:57.191 --> 04:58.502
Looks like there's some pie over there,

04:58.526 --> 05:00.075
why don't you have a look.

05:01.228 --> 05:02.428
Okay.

05:05.065 --> 05:06.032
She's sleeping better.

05:06.066 --> 05:07.901
No nightmares for a week.

05:08.922 --> 05:10.122
What about you?

05:13.113 --> 05:14.947
I can't take a leave right now.

05:15.409 --> 05:16.609
I can't do it.

05:19.118 --> 05:21.019
You lost your sister

05:21.044 --> 05:22.878
and now we're raising her daughter.

05:27.054 --> 05:28.421
Your life got turned upside down.

05:28.455 --> 05:30.290
They should understand that.

05:38.566 --> 05:39.990
There's a man

05:40.568 --> 05:42.202
with a gun

05:42.236 --> 05:44.537
in the laundromat next door.

05:44.572 --> 05:45.972
I'm a police officer,

05:46.874 --> 05:48.274
tell me what happened.

05:48.909 --> 05:50.109
He came in,

05:50.144 --> 05:51.878
didn't say anything.

05:51.912 --> 05:53.256
Walked right past me with the gun.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.781
I think he was crying.

05:54.815 --> 05:56.049
Was it a rifle?

05:56.750 --> 05:57.951
A handgun?

06:00.087 --> 06:01.754
How many people are over there right now?

06:01.789 --> 06:04.457
Um, 4 or 5.

06:04.491 --> 06:05.558
I-I'm not sure.

06:05.593 --> 06:06.993
I want you to stay put.

06:08.062 --> 06:09.778
Close the blinds. Lock the door.

06:09.813 --> 06:11.297
Everybody get on the floor.

06:11.332 --> 06:13.733
I don't want you answering
the door for anyone

06:13.767 --> 06:15.168
unless it's the police.

06:19.573 --> 06:20.807
This is Dyson.

06:20.841 --> 06:23.409
I'm at the Sunshine Laundromat on Main.

06:23.444 --> 06:25.945
There's an armed man. I need backup.

07:32.513 --> 07:34.280
Police. Don't move!

07:34.315 --> 07:35.915
Drop your weapon!

07:39.586 --> 07:41.420
You shouldn't be here.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.157
You really should go.

07:45.259 --> 07:47.093
I'm not here to hurt you,

07:48.329 --> 07:49.729
I am here to help.

07:50.998 --> 07:52.398
My name is Noelle.

07:54.368 --> 07:55.568
Okay.

07:58.005 --> 07:59.839
What's the gun for, sir?

08:02.009 --> 08:03.209
I...

08:06.213 --> 08:08.214
I have to do something.

08:08.248 --> 08:10.849
Okay, well, it is making me nervous.

08:11.452 --> 08:13.453
Maybe you could put it
down on the ground.

08:14.413 --> 08:15.614
What's your name?

08:18.859 --> 08:20.059
It's Perry.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.595
You been having a hard time, Perry?

08:25.933 --> 08:27.699
Everything was fine.

08:28.302 --> 08:31.170
I was managing fine.

08:31.205 --> 08:33.506
You know, this is where we first met.

08:33.539 --> 08:35.375
Right here. Three years ago.

08:37.311 --> 08:38.611
Who did you meet?

08:38.645 --> 08:41.129
She was the only one who saw me.

08:42.216 --> 08:43.383
You know what that's like?

08:43.417 --> 08:44.784
Yeah, yeah.

08:44.818 --> 08:46.052
I do.

08:47.921 --> 08:49.756
I lost my sister last month.

08:52.226 --> 08:54.060
She was my best friend.

08:56.830 --> 08:58.064
What happened?

09:04.938 --> 09:06.139
Cancer.

09:15.149 --> 09:16.349
I'm sorry.

09:18.252 --> 09:20.086
But it's not the same.

09:22.122 --> 09:23.790
There's still a hole

09:23.824 --> 09:25.382
where she used to be.

09:26.126 --> 09:29.262
I don't think I'll ever
stop feeling it there.

09:29.296 --> 09:30.496
A hole.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.101
Yeah I feel that too.

09:37.538 --> 09:38.738
You can tell me what happened.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.274
Perry!

10:21.465 --> 10:22.664
Go.

10:24.467 --> 10:25.667
Thank you.

10:34.477 --> 10:36.311
Noelle, you okay there?

10:46.890 --> 10:48.323
I knew the kid.

10:49.159 --> 10:50.993
He lived in my division.

10:54.097 --> 10:56.222
I want to do the notification.

10:58.201 --> 11:00.035
You sure about that?

11:01.838 --> 11:03.038
Yeah.

11:13.516 --> 11:14.483
Hey.

11:14.517 --> 11:15.851
Hey.

11:15.885 --> 11:17.286
We heard about Dyson.

11:18.288 --> 11:19.988
Think it was pretty ugly over there.

11:20.023 --> 11:21.343
Do you know if she's coming back?

11:24.294 --> 11:26.528
Has anything come back from Ident?

11:26.563 --> 11:27.930
Lab called a minute ago,

11:27.964 --> 11:30.381
neither victims' prints
were in the system.

11:31.034 --> 11:32.734
Victims, killer, witness-

11:32.769 --> 11:34.937
not a single hit.

11:34.971 --> 11:36.205
No.

11:36.606 --> 11:37.806
Okay.

11:41.611 --> 11:42.611
Okay, thanks.

11:42.645 --> 11:44.947
Guys! We might just
have something for ya.

11:51.821 --> 11:53.255
Irena and Roman Barstow.

11:56.326 --> 11:58.393
Yeah it looks like the same rings.

11:58.428 --> 11:59.605
Organizer over at the Sportsman's Show

11:59.629 --> 12:01.096
called in a missing persons on them.

12:01.130 --> 12:03.098
Said they set up their booth

12:03.132 --> 12:05.200
but they never came back.

12:05.235 --> 12:07.236
Did you find out where they were staying?

12:17.981 --> 12:19.481
The manager confirms

12:19.515 --> 12:21.750
the Barstows rented the
big boat down there

12:21.784 --> 12:24.920
to entertain clients
from the Sportsman's Show.

12:24.954 --> 12:27.489
They rented it the last two years.

12:27.523 --> 12:28.991
He says they're nice people,

12:29.025 --> 12:30.259
no problems.

12:31.961 --> 12:34.396
Anyone on board since they disappeared?

12:34.430 --> 12:37.266
No. No one else should have a key.

12:43.106 --> 12:44.306
Okay.

12:46.276 --> 12:48.120
So after the murders
the killer takes the boat key

12:48.144 --> 12:49.978
and comes here looking for something.

12:50.013 --> 12:51.813
Looking for what?

12:51.848 --> 12:53.048
Money?

12:53.483 --> 12:55.417
The show was just getting started,

12:55.451 --> 12:57.286
they wouldn't have made anything yet.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.655
I have the override code.

13:03.726 --> 13:04.793
Let's see.

13:04.827 --> 13:06.161
4791.

13:06.195 --> 13:09.798
4-7-9-1.

13:15.805 --> 13:18.640
So either they never used the safe

13:18.675 --> 13:20.008
or he found out their code.

13:20.043 --> 13:21.677
I'll get Ident here

13:21.711 --> 13:24.546
to see if we can match the
prints from Island Road.

13:29.252 --> 13:30.485
Cardinal.

13:32.822 --> 13:34.222
Looks like sawdust.

13:35.325 --> 13:37.392
That might tell us where they've been.

14:35.885 --> 14:37.185
I'm so sorry.

14:37.220 --> 14:38.620
Are you okay?

16:50.186 --> 16:51.553
I saw him.

16:51.587 --> 16:52.554
At school today.

16:52.588 --> 16:53.555
What are you talking about?

16:53.589 --> 16:54.623
Saw who?

16:54.657 --> 16:56.925
The man who-who chased me at the house.

16:56.959 --> 16:58.793
The one who shot at me.

16:59.795 --> 17:01.530
Randall, I need to see you.

17:01.564 --> 17:03.698
Okay, Sam, that can't happen.

17:03.733 --> 17:05.042
Look baby, I know that you're freaked out

17:05.067 --> 17:06.244
but whatever went down at that house,

17:06.269 --> 17:07.702
it has nothing to do with you.

17:07.737 --> 17:09.905
You're just worked up
and you're seeing things.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.276
I gotta call you back.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.651
Hey.

17:23.286 --> 17:24.252
What's going on?

17:24.287 --> 17:25.252
Thank you.

17:25.288 --> 17:27.289
I just had lunch with the Hannetts.

17:27.323 --> 17:29.858
And they want me to run
in the by-election.

17:29.892 --> 17:31.726
You're going to run for office?

17:32.295 --> 17:34.262
You don't think that I should?

17:34.297 --> 17:35.697
No, no no no, it's not that

17:35.731 --> 17:38.266
I just I didn't realize you
wanted to get into politics.

17:38.301 --> 17:39.634
This is gonna be good for us.

17:39.669 --> 17:41.046
Maybe you can take more on around here.

17:41.070 --> 17:42.404
I'll could get you a raise?

17:42.438 --> 17:44.205
Sure, whatever works.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.707
It's awesome, Laura.

17:45.741 --> 17:47.208
Just tell me which hands to shake

17:47.243 --> 17:48.843
and which babies to kiss.

17:49.912 --> 17:51.290
Go pour us a drink. I'll be right there.

17:51.314 --> 17:52.514
Of course.

18:08.698 --> 18:09.664
Hey.

18:09.699 --> 18:11.132
Sorry I took so long.

18:13.436 --> 18:15.236
Are you okay with this move?

18:15.271 --> 18:17.105
It's asking a lot of you, I know.

18:17.607 --> 18:18.907
I'm happy for you.

18:18.941 --> 18:20.141
I really am.

18:21.010 --> 18:23.111
I know this isn't your dream job,

18:23.145 --> 18:24.356
but you'll be running the place now.

18:24.380 --> 18:25.512
With some help.

18:25.546 --> 18:28.316
Soon you'll get to be the star
around here instead of me.

18:28.351 --> 18:30.018
I love you.

18:30.052 --> 18:31.286
I love our life.

18:35.024 --> 18:37.092
Somebody wants you pretty
bad, Randall Wishart.

18:37.126 --> 18:38.660
Yeah, it's probably just Troy.

18:38.694 --> 18:40.295
Troy.

18:40.329 --> 18:42.797
You need some new friends, babe.

18:53.212 --> 18:55.213
You know you can wait in the car.

19:12.432 --> 19:13.665
Margaret?

19:13.700 --> 19:15.033
Yeah?

19:15.068 --> 19:16.401
I'm Detective Jerry Commanda

19:16.436 --> 19:18.070
with the OPD.

19:18.104 --> 19:20.906
And this is Detective Sergeant Dyson.

19:20.940 --> 19:23.362
We need to talk with you. Inside.

19:23.397 --> 19:24.509
Did Perry call you?

19:24.544 --> 19:27.079
Because whatever he said,
this is my stuff.

19:27.113 --> 19:29.124
He's delusional if he thinks
I'd take anything of his.

19:29.148 --> 19:30.415
It's not like that.

19:30.450 --> 19:32.617
Breaking up with
someone isn't against the law.

19:32.652 --> 19:33.885
Even if he wants it to be.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.120
Margaret.

19:36.089 --> 19:37.289
Perry's dead.

19:37.957 --> 19:39.858
He shot himself two hours ago.

19:39.892 --> 19:41.727
Inside the laundromat, on Main.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.000
Okay.

19:50.069 --> 19:51.903
Thanks for letting me know.

20:02.482 --> 20:03.682
Margaret.

20:05.685 --> 20:07.452
Did you hear me?

20:07.487 --> 20:08.687
Yeah.

20:09.288 --> 20:11.256
Perry got what he's
been wanting for years.

20:11.290 --> 20:14.126
I'm just glad I'm not the
one who has to clean it up.

20:17.930 --> 20:19.331
You can go now.

20:28.941 --> 20:30.519
And they never came back to their booth.

20:30.543 --> 20:31.743
I wanted to make sure

20:31.778 --> 20:33.745
they weren't stranded on
the side of the highway.

20:33.780 --> 20:34.980
I didn't think they were...

20:35.515 --> 20:37.349
I mean, anyone would hurt them.

20:38.317 --> 20:39.818
And they were friends of yours?

20:39.852 --> 20:41.052
Irena was.

20:41.387 --> 20:43.017
I've known her ten years.

20:44.059 --> 20:45.791
If you wanted your family crest,

20:45.825 --> 20:48.627
or pink camo, Irena
would make it for you.

20:48.661 --> 20:50.829
And it would be a work of art.

20:50.863 --> 20:53.865
She made one like this for me as a gift.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.357
We got really close over the years and...

21:00.422 --> 21:02.990
I-I can't do this right now.

21:03.024 --> 21:05.492
What can you tell us about Roman?

21:05.527 --> 21:06.842
Pretty good guy.

21:06.877 --> 21:08.228
I mean, even tempered,

21:08.263 --> 21:10.364
he wasn't a drunk,
he didn't sleep around.

21:10.398 --> 21:11.999
Had a lot of money to throw around, too.

21:12.033 --> 21:13.867
He helped Irena build her business.

21:15.036 --> 21:17.905
It wasn't just about
the money, though.

21:17.939 --> 21:19.373
Roman made Irena happy.

21:21.609 --> 21:22.687
He made a lot of people happy.

21:22.711 --> 21:26.113
He was kind and generous
with his friends.

21:26.147 --> 21:28.015
And nobody felt differently about him?

21:28.049 --> 21:29.516
Or her?

21:29.551 --> 21:32.786
Well, there was
Irena's ex-husband, Monty.

21:32.821 --> 21:35.756
They started coming here
together to sell Irena's bows,

21:35.790 --> 21:38.225
and Monty drank away
all the money she'd make.

21:38.259 --> 21:40.794
And where's Monty now?

22:42.123 --> 22:43.554
Monty Logan?

22:57.672 --> 22:59.673
Any chance I could grab
a beer to wash these down?

23:12.353 --> 23:15.189
My wife's dead and I
can't even get a beer.

23:16.324 --> 23:18.380
Your ex-wife, no?

23:23.698 --> 23:24.898
Get it.

23:40.014 --> 23:42.850
I knew if she stayed with Roman
something bad would happen.

23:43.084 --> 23:44.918
What makes you say that?

23:45.887 --> 23:48.188
'Cuz that guy was shady as hell.

23:48.223 --> 23:49.423
Shady how?

23:50.458 --> 23:52.623
Irena and me started
the custom bow thing.

23:55.296 --> 23:57.064
Soon as it took off,

23:57.098 --> 24:00.434
Roman drove up with a truckload of cash

24:00.468 --> 24:02.569
to buy us out.

24:02.604 --> 24:04.605
Guess he thought Irena
was part of the deal.

24:05.773 --> 24:08.609
What kind of a man takes
another man's wife?

24:09.210 --> 24:10.410
Lots of them.

24:12.213 --> 24:13.814
You know what's sad?

24:15.617 --> 24:18.185
The only reason I come to
this town is to see her,

24:18.219 --> 24:19.419
once a year.

24:21.623 --> 24:23.857
When did you see her this year?

24:23.892 --> 24:25.225
I didn't.

24:25.260 --> 24:29.096
They were no-shows at the welcome party,

24:29.130 --> 24:30.964
didn't see them at the booth.

24:33.401 --> 24:35.235
Thought she was avoiding me.

24:38.473 --> 24:40.129
Alibi checks out.

24:41.476 --> 24:43.644
Quite a few people remember
your karaoke performance

24:43.678 --> 24:44.912
from Saturday night.

24:48.082 --> 24:49.283
Hey.

24:51.619 --> 24:52.819
Hey.

24:55.089 --> 24:56.657
You said Roman was shady.

24:56.691 --> 24:57.925
Well.

24:58.993 --> 25:00.193
I mean,

25:00.862 --> 25:03.068
he used to be an exec at a gun company.

25:04.866 --> 25:06.733
Those guys are all criminals.

25:06.768 --> 25:09.825
You think he retired at
50 on stock options alone?

25:11.372 --> 25:13.240
What are you suggesting, Mr. Logan?

25:13.274 --> 25:16.910
That Irena isn't dead over bad luck,

25:16.945 --> 25:20.085
some random thing.

25:21.783 --> 25:24.451
She's dead because of Roman Barstow.

25:24.485 --> 25:26.286
I guarantee it.

25:33.461 --> 25:37.019
And I let him take her from me.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.133
Twice.

25:52.714 --> 25:55.616
Marina security cameras
caught a man in a hoodie

25:55.650 --> 25:59.353
entering the Barstow's yacht
two hours after the murders.

25:59.387 --> 26:01.021
Didn't get a shot of his face.

26:01.055 --> 26:03.890
Well, we know it wasn't Monty Logan.

26:03.925 --> 26:05.158
No.

26:05.860 --> 26:07.294
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:07.328 --> 26:08.295
Dyson's back.

26:08.329 --> 26:09.296
How is she?

26:09.330 --> 26:10.574
Well, I went to get her signature

26:10.598 --> 26:11.898
but she was in the bathroom.

26:11.933 --> 26:14.768
That was an hour ago and
she still hasn't come out.

26:17.071 --> 26:18.271
Yeah?

26:22.377 --> 26:23.577
Hey.

26:24.245 --> 26:25.445
I've still got

26:26.581 --> 26:29.583
some blood here, maybe
it's ketchup from lunch.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.321
You know that kid who shot himself,

26:34.355 --> 26:35.389
I did the notification.

26:35.423 --> 26:38.358
His girlfriend didn't even
care that he was dead.

26:40.762 --> 26:42.596
But you don't know that.

26:44.399 --> 26:46.233
People grieve in different ways.

26:47.368 --> 26:48.568
Yeah.

26:51.105 --> 26:52.939
Any progress on Island Road?

26:53.775 --> 26:55.776
Yes. We've ID'd the victims.

26:56.711 --> 26:57.911
No suspects.

27:01.935 --> 27:03.335
With all due respect,

27:04.752 --> 27:06.153
you shouldn't be here.

27:08.188 --> 27:09.388
Go home,

27:10.124 --> 27:11.958
go be with your family.

27:17.765 --> 27:19.166
It's easier here.

27:52.667 --> 27:55.032
John.

27:57.972 --> 28:01.371
John, stop it.

28:04.278 --> 28:05.479
John.

28:06.481 --> 28:07.681
Don't.

28:11.552 --> 28:12.786
John.

28:22.497 --> 28:23.697
Hello.

28:26.467 --> 28:29.107
No, Catherine's not here.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.274
Catherine-Catherine Cardinal

28:34.308 --> 28:35.709
is dead.

28:37.311 --> 28:41.745
So, take her off your call list, please.

28:51.170 --> 28:53.039
How she must be hated you.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.898
You failed her so completely.

28:55.867 --> 28:57.134
Is that how you feel?

28:57.168 --> 28:58.502
That you failed Catherine?

28:58.536 --> 28:59.970
I didn't write the card.

29:04.814 --> 29:06.015
But yes.

29:07.645 --> 29:10.440
But that's not why I'm here.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.816
I need you to tell me,

29:12.850 --> 29:16.119
what kind of person writes and sends

29:16.154 --> 29:17.220
that kind of card?

29:17.255 --> 29:19.790
Profiling is not my specialty.

29:19.824 --> 29:21.168
I'm sure you have someone at the station-

29:21.192 --> 29:23.326
I am asking you.

29:23.361 --> 29:25.495
As a favour to me.

29:25.530 --> 29:28.709
Just, give me your best guess.

29:31.869 --> 29:33.069
Very well.

29:40.078 --> 29:41.845
The writer is sneering at you

29:41.879 --> 29:44.214
because they know you can't retaliate.

29:44.248 --> 29:45.982
There was no return address you said,

29:46.017 --> 29:47.061
the postmarks are all different?

29:47.085 --> 29:48.285
That's right.

29:50.722 --> 29:53.156
It's likely someone who
feels insignificant,

29:53.191 --> 29:54.391
a failure.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.494
Someone whose suffered-

29:57.528 --> 29:59.663
and they decided to blame you for it.

29:59.697 --> 30:01.331
I mean, you're a police officer

30:01.365 --> 30:04.334
you must have your share of enemies?

30:04.368 --> 30:05.669
Yeah.

30:05.703 --> 30:07.838
But, this isn't just
someone you imprisoned...

30:07.872 --> 30:12.876
This is someone who lost
something as a result.

30:12.910 --> 30:14.544
A job, a wife, a home,

30:14.579 --> 30:16.012
,maybe all three.

30:16.047 --> 30:19.176
It strike you as someone
capable of violence?

30:19.751 --> 30:22.679
What, are you concerned for your safety?

30:25.123 --> 30:26.556
I see.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.470
You think this person had something to do

30:29.494 --> 30:30.694
with Catherine's death.

30:30.728 --> 30:32.129
It's just a question.

30:33.231 --> 30:34.431
John,

30:35.133 --> 30:37.968
do you doubt that Catherine
took her own life?

30:39.112 --> 30:40.771
I know what the evidence says.

30:40.805 --> 30:44.785
I asked what you believe.

30:48.813 --> 30:50.647
I believe I knew my wife.

31:03.461 --> 31:04.728
Muffins.

31:04.971 --> 31:07.397
You look like your not eating.

31:07.431 --> 31:10.734
No, I'm-I'm-I'm fine. I-

31:16.274 --> 31:19.810
Helen, when-when Catherine came here-

31:19.844 --> 31:21.645
Thank you, thank you-

31:21.679 --> 31:24.324
Um, were there ever any-

31:26.250 --> 31:28.618
Any other patients who seemed
overly interested in her?

31:28.653 --> 31:30.854
Were there any, um,

31:30.888 --> 31:33.256
disagreements of any kind?

31:33.291 --> 31:34.491
No, never.

31:35.126 --> 31:38.328
I try not to have any
overlap between patients.

31:38.362 --> 31:41.131
It's so personal,
what gets said in there.

31:41.165 --> 31:43.133
I want them to feel safe.

31:43.167 --> 31:47.097
Did you and, and Catherine talk much?

31:49.507 --> 31:52.602
It can be lonely sitting at that desk.

31:53.211 --> 31:56.379
But not when Catherine
had an appointment.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.733
She always made me smile.

32:06.490 --> 32:08.859
Everyone you've put behind
bars going back to 2010,

32:08.893 --> 32:11.695
narrowed down by who was
married when they went away.

32:11.729 --> 32:14.040
I appreciate your help.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.918
And your discretion.

32:19.003 --> 32:20.203
What's in there?

32:21.631 --> 32:23.006
Muffins.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.875
You baking now? What kind?

32:26.944 --> 32:30.098
Just take the box.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.984
Yo, Kular, what's in the box?

32:34.018 --> 32:35.752
- No.
- Muffins, yeah?

32:35.786 --> 32:37.020
No, Ash...

32:39.023 --> 32:40.857
The Barstows had a rental car.

32:42.026 --> 32:43.493
Have we found it?

32:43.527 --> 32:45.262
No, but we have the model and plates.

32:45.296 --> 32:46.897
So we're going to issue a joint BOLO

32:46.931 --> 32:49.366
with the RCMP and OPD.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.612
We should get in touch with
transit and security companies.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.003
Anybody that drives for a living.

32:53.037 --> 32:54.704
That ought to cover more ground.

32:54.739 --> 32:55.939
Yeah.

32:57.541 --> 32:58.942
You've pulled suspects?

33:00.077 --> 33:01.945
No. This is

33:01.979 --> 33:03.213
it's another thing.

33:04.988 --> 33:06.188
I'll tell you later.

33:08.252 --> 33:10.086
Why don't you tell me now?

33:15.559 --> 33:17.394
Those cards I've been getting.

33:18.296 --> 33:19.496
I got another one.

33:19.997 --> 33:21.564
Okay.

33:21.599 --> 33:23.433
That's gone on long enough.

33:23.467 --> 33:25.235
I'm gonna put someone on it.

33:25.269 --> 33:26.469
No.

33:27.071 --> 33:28.271
No.

33:28.572 --> 33:30.492
I need to do this myself.

33:34.578 --> 33:35.779
Okay.

33:50.594 --> 33:51.995
Your father called.

33:52.029 --> 33:53.263
He misses you.

33:53.597 --> 33:55.684
Thinks he'll be home in a week.

33:56.801 --> 33:59.336
And that boy Braden called again.

33:59.854 --> 34:01.738
You know the bonus to
you losing your phone

34:01.772 --> 34:04.109
is I can keep tabs on your love life.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.520
But I hope you're saving
up for a new one.

34:06.544 --> 34:07.978
I need mine for work.

34:08.612 --> 34:10.146
Irena Barstow, 36,

34:10.181 --> 34:12.782
and Roman Barstow, 57,

34:12.817 --> 34:13.850
visitors from New York,

34:13.884 --> 34:16.319
were killed in a house on Island Road.

34:16.353 --> 34:19.322
The reason for their presence
in that house is unknown.

34:19.357 --> 34:22.692
Their bodies were recovered from
Trout Lake yesterday morning.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.757
We urge anyone

34:24.792 --> 34:27.364
who saw or spoke to the Barstows

34:27.799 --> 34:29.498
to please come forward.

34:29.533 --> 34:32.302
If anyone has any information

34:32.335 --> 34:34.170
please call the ABPD tip-line.

34:36.239 --> 34:37.540
You've reached Randall Wishart.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.609
Leave a message and I
will get back to you.

34:40.643 --> 34:43.188
He killed two people.

34:45.349 --> 34:47.350
I saw him on the bus.

34:47.385 --> 34:48.585
He followed me.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.521
Randall, he has my phone.

34:56.092 --> 34:58.288
Hello?

35:03.067 --> 35:04.267
Hello?

35:08.773 --> 35:10.206
Sam Duchene.

35:12.009 --> 35:13.209
Who is this?

35:15.946 --> 35:17.682
I like your drawings.

35:20.226 --> 35:21.978
I promise I-

35:23.587 --> 35:25.021
I didn't see anything.

35:27.591 --> 35:28.792
Please.

35:29.393 --> 35:32.896
Please just leave me alone.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.269
Leave me alone.

36:58.766 --> 36:59.999
Cardinal.

37:02.116 --> 37:03.871
Hi Sylvie.

37:08.776 --> 37:10.310
Okay. Well,

37:10.344 --> 37:12.345
I think I might know where to look.

37:17.184 --> 37:18.384
He was right there

37:19.720 --> 37:20.920
in front of me,

37:24.298 --> 37:25.498
this kid.

37:30.110 --> 37:31.310
And I thought...

37:34.042 --> 37:36.877
I was so sure I was
getting through to him.

37:40.648 --> 37:41.849
I was so close.

37:45.987 --> 37:47.498
I keep thinking,

37:49.524 --> 37:51.892
what did I do wrong? What-

37:52.393 --> 37:54.228
could I have done differently?

38:00.401 --> 38:02.555
Is that how you feel about Catherine?

38:11.012 --> 38:12.212
Sometimes.

38:17.619 --> 38:18.852
I'm sorry, John.

38:21.589 --> 38:22.790
It's fine.

38:30.799 --> 38:32.633
I don't want to go home.

38:35.537 --> 38:36.737
Me neither.

39:04.065 --> 39:06.900
This is a message for Detective Delorme.

39:41.482 --> 39:44.317
Place still standing as far as I can see.

39:44.351 --> 39:45.552
More or less.

39:46.153 --> 39:47.987
How was the Big Smoke?

39:48.022 --> 39:52.559
It's got nothing over this place.

39:52.593 --> 39:55.862
Well, you missed the news around here.

39:55.896 --> 39:58.898
Fancy couple got murdered
up on Island Road

39:58.933 --> 40:00.700
and dumped in the lake.

40:00.734 --> 40:02.068
This lake?

40:02.103 --> 40:04.104
No, Trout.

40:05.673 --> 40:07.972
Well, small mercies.

40:10.544 --> 40:11.878
My daughter call?

40:11.912 --> 40:13.895
No, no calls.

40:23.057 --> 40:24.591
The dry food

40:24.625 --> 40:26.559
and the meat should last us for a while.

40:26.594 --> 40:30.263
But we'll have to go into town
to get some fresh vegetables.

40:30.297 --> 40:32.065
Yeah I'll-I'll go tomorrow.

40:32.099 --> 40:33.500
We'll get you set up for the week.

40:33.534 --> 40:34.734
Henry.

40:35.136 --> 40:36.569
It's okay, it's late.

40:36.770 --> 40:39.506
I can start the fire myself.

40:39.540 --> 40:41.040
- You sure?
- Yeah.

40:41.075 --> 40:45.078
Unless you want a-a game of chess first?

40:45.112 --> 40:46.756
Actually, there's a book
I was in the middle of,

40:46.780 --> 40:48.615
I was hoping I could get back to it.

40:48.649 --> 40:50.723
Alright, alright.

40:51.986 --> 40:53.419
How about tomorrow?

40:56.143 --> 40:57.343
Tomorrow it is.

40:58.799 --> 40:59.999
Good night, Henry.

41:01.455 --> 41:02.655
Alright, good night.

41:39.133 --> 41:40.667
Mama wants you to know

41:40.701 --> 41:42.068
this isn't personal.

42:03.691 --> 42:05.089
You forget something?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.432
Who are you?

42:18.672 --> 42:19.872
Shoes.

42:20.641 --> 42:22.976
I asked you people what
you're doing in my house.

42:23.010 --> 42:24.410
Now, now, now.

42:26.213 --> 42:28.237
Let's not start that way.

42:31.051 --> 42:32.485
What do you want.

42:32.820 --> 42:35.119
Lets all just settle in.

42:36.037 --> 42:38.224
Got plenty of time to
get to know each other.
