- GEE, AMY, IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE HERE

00:07.067 --> 00:08.500
FOR A BRIDAL SHOWER.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.167
- WHY WOULD THEY BE HERE
FOR A BRIDAL SHOWER?

00:10.167 --> 00:12.767
- I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE IT'S
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING--

00:12.767 --> 00:13.967

YOU ARE THE BEST
MATRON OF HONOR EVER.

00:22.867 --> 00:26.200

00:26.200 --> 00:28.900
OKAY, EVERYBODY,

I'M THE MATRON--

01:06.800 --> 01:09.733
I'M THE SHOWER-THROWER.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.267
TO HAVE THE FINEST
ITALIAN APPETIZERS.

01:17.267 --> 01:20.100
- I'VE GOT IT COVERED, OKAY?

01:20.100 --> 01:22.367
- OHH.

01:22.367 --> 01:26.700
OHH, I KNOW
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.567

A LULL AFTER THAT.

OH, I KNOW.

02:37.900 --> 02:39.100
BRIDAL BINGO.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.400

02:54.267 --> 02:55.500
AND I'LL TAKE CARE

02:57.133 --> 02:58.867
- WHAT?
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

02:58.867 --> 03:00.433

03:00.433 --> 03:02.800
I KNOW YOU THINK I CAN'T
SURVIVE WITHOUT YOU,

03:02.800 --> 03:04.000
BUT I CAN.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.267

06:11.000 --> 06:12.500
WAIT, WAIT, DEB.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.267
I COULDN'T FIND
MY BROWN BELT TODAY.

06:14.267 --> 06:15.467
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

06:15.467 --> 06:17.167
- RAY, JUST GET DOWN HERE!

06:19.467 --> 06:21.100
- ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING.

06:25.267 --> 06:26.767
- MY HUSBAND IS COMING
TO PICK ME UP,

06:26.767 --> 06:27.967
SO I CAN JUST WAIT OUT FRONT.

06:27.967 --> 06:29.167
- GET IN.

06:29.167 --> 06:31.233
- BUT I WASN'T DRIVING THE CAR.

06:31.233 --> 06:34.100
HOW COULD IT BE A D.U.I.
IF THERE'S NO "D"?

06:34.100 --> 06:36.867
- IN.

06:36.867 --> 06:38.600
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.233
FINE, BUT WHEN
THE TRUTH COMES OUT,

06:40.233 --> 06:42.500
THIS IS GOING TO BE
SO EMBARRASSING...

06:42.500 --> 06:45.000
FOR YOU.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.600
OH, FINE.
FINE.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.367
I'VE GOT THREE KIDS AT HOME.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.033
I'M JUST HAPPY TO BE
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.433
HELLO.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.800

07:02.800 --> 07:04.967
THIS IS JAIL, HUH?

07:04.967 --> 07:07.700
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
NOT TOO BAD.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.967
NICE FOLKS.

07:09.967 --> 07:12.600
A PLACE TO LIE DOWN.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.733
TOILET RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM.

07:20.833 --> 07:23.367
IS MY HUSBAND HERE YET?

07:26.733 --> 07:29.867
HELLO, CAN I HAVE A TISSUE?

07:29.867 --> 07:33.400
COME ON, I JUST WANT A TISSUE!

07:33.400 --> 07:37.667
WHAT KIND OF A PLACE IS THIS?!

07:37.667 --> 07:39.167
FINE!

07:39.167 --> 07:40.567
I'M AN ANIMAL NOW!

07:40.567 --> 07:43.333
ARE YOU HAPPY?

07:43.333 --> 07:44.667
- I DON'T WANT
TO GO IN THERE.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.067
- OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE!

07:57.067 --> 07:58.267
- ARE YOU OKAY?

07:58.267 --> 08:00.933
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

08:00.933 --> 08:03.000
- SO...

08:03.000 --> 08:04.533
HOW WAS AMY'S SHOWER?

08:04.533 --> 08:06.767
- JUST--

08:06.767 --> 08:08.300
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.333
- WERE YOU REALLY
DRIVING DRUNK?

08:10.333 --> 08:11.600
- I WAS NOT DRIVING DRUNK.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.467
I HAD A FEW DRINKS
AND I FELL ASLEEP,

08:13.467 --> 08:15.533
AND THERE'S SOME LAW SAYS
IF THE KEY IS IN THE IGNITION

08:15.533 --> 08:17.167
AND YOU'RE BEHIND THE WHEEL,

08:17.167 --> 08:18.867
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU'RE GOING OR NOT.

08:18.867 --> 08:20.400
THEY JUST TAKE YOU TO JAIL.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.100
AND WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.467
I CALLED YOU FROM THE CAR.

08:23.467 --> 08:25.300
- I TOOK THE KIDS TO GET PIZZA,

08:25.300 --> 08:27.133
AND THEN WE STARTED
PLAYING PAC-MAN,

08:27.133 --> 08:29.600
AND THEY WOULDN'T LET ME LEAVE
UNTIL I GOT THE HIGHEST SCORE,

08:29.600 --> 08:33.133
AND I DID--
I BEAT IT BY A LOT.

08:33.133 --> 08:34.567
- I LEFT YOU A MESSAGE.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.333
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHECK
THE MESSAGES?

08:36.333 --> 08:39.300
- BECAUSE THEY'RE
ALWAYS FOR YOU.

08:39.300 --> 08:41.967
- FROM NOW ON,
CHECK THE MESSAGES!

08:41.967 --> 08:43.733
- OKAY, OKAY.

08:43.733 --> 08:46.367
NOW THAT I KNOW YOU
COULD BE IN JAIL, I WILL.

08:51.100 --> 08:53.167
- YOU KNOW WHOSE FAULT
THIS REALLY IS?

08:53.167 --> 08:55.100
YOUR MOTHER'S.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.567
SHE MADE ME SO MAD
AT THAT SHOWER,

08:56.567 --> 08:59.033
I STARTED DRINKING,
AND HERE I AM!

08:59.033 --> 09:00.733
OH, MY GOD, SHE IS SO--

09:00.733 --> 09:03.467
LISTEN, SHE CAN
NEVER KNOW ABOUT THIS.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.033
OH, MY GOD!

09:10.033 --> 09:12.633
YOU TOLD HER I WAS IN JAIL?

09:12.633 --> 09:13.767
- A LITTLE.

09:15.267 --> 09:18.767
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

09:18.767 --> 09:20.167
- GUARD!

09:25.867 --> 09:27.067
- JUST GET ME OUT OF HERE.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.267
- ALL RIGHT.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.667
RELAX, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

09:30.667 --> 09:31.800
OH, AND, DEBRA,

09:31.800 --> 09:34.267
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
WHILE YOU WERE IN HERE,

09:34.267 --> 09:37.100
I NEVER THOUGHT
OF ANYONE ELSE.

09:38.833 --> 09:41.033
- WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL PUT IN
A COUPLE MORE HOURS,

09:41.033 --> 09:42.767
AND THEN I'LL PUNCH OUT.

09:42.767 --> 09:44.200
HEY, RAY.
HEY, DEB.

09:53.700 --> 09:54.933
DEBRA?

09:54.933 --> 09:57.200
- HI, ROBERT.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.800
- OH, MY GOD.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.533
SHE FINALLY KILLED MOM.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.300
- OH, THANK GOD!

10:15.300 --> 10:16.700
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

10:16.700 --> 10:17.900
- YEAH, I'M FINE, MARIE.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.100
I'M JUST A LITTLE TIRED.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.300
- OH, WELL, I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW

10:21.300 --> 10:22.700
THAT IN THIS FAMILY,

10:22.700 --> 10:27.567
WHATEVER OUR DIFFERENCES,
WE STAND TOGETHER.

10:27.567 --> 10:29.433
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

10:29.433 --> 10:34.167
NO MATTER HOW MUCH SHAME
YOU'VE BROUGHT UPON US.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.733
WHAT DID YOU DO?

10:36.733 --> 10:38.167
-YOU KNOW, NOTHING.

10:38.167 --> 10:42.133
IT WAS JUST A MINOR
TRAFFIC MISUNDERSTANDING.

10:42.133 --> 10:44.900
- THANK GOD.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.733
WHAT DID SHE DO?

10:46.733 --> 10:48.100
- NOTHING.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.167
SHE TOOK A NAP IN THE CAR,
THAT'S ALL.

10:50.167 --> 10:51.400
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.300
WHY WOULD THEY
ARREST HER FOR THAT?

10:53.300 --> 10:54.700
- WERE YOU NAKED?

11:05.233 --> 11:08.367
- NO, I WAS NOT NAKED.

11:08.367 --> 11:12.867
I JUST TOOK A LITTLE NAP
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO DRIVE.

11:12.867 --> 11:15.567
- WHY NOT?

11:15.567 --> 11:19.067
- BECAUSE I HAD A LITTLE
TOO MUCH CHAMPAGNE.

11:19.067 --> 11:21.033
- DRUNKEN DRIVING!

11:21.033 --> 11:22.667
OH, MY GOD!

11:22.667 --> 11:24.033
DRUNKEN DRIVING!

11:24.033 --> 11:27.800
OH, IT IS SO AWFUL!

11:27.800 --> 11:31.767
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

11:31.767 --> 11:33.467
THE MESSY HOUSE,

11:33.467 --> 11:35.467
THE KIDS
RUNNING AROUND FILTHY,

11:35.467 --> 11:37.933
THE WAY SHE TALKS TO ME--

11:37.933 --> 11:40.667
IT'S ALL CLEAR NOW.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.867
- DEB--

11:41.867 --> 11:44.167
OH!

11:44.167 --> 11:48.400
HELLO, EVERYBODY.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.967
I WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

11:51.967 --> 11:54.133
SAW THE LIGHTS ON.

11:54.133 --> 11:58.300
THOUGHT I'D COME BY
AND SAY HI-DEE-HO.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.367
HI-DEE-HO, EVERYBODY.

12:03.633 --> 12:06.600
BY THE WAY, DEBRA,
EVERYTHING IS COPACETIC

12:06.600 --> 12:09.433
VIS-A-VIS THE SITUATION
WE DISCUSSED EARLIER.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.367
- YEAH, YOU'RE REAL SMOOTH.

12:13.367 --> 12:16.567
WE ALL KNOW SHE WAS
IN THE SLAMMER.

12:16.567 --> 12:17.767
- MA KNOWS?

12:17.767 --> 12:20.567
- YEAH, BUT SHE TOOK IT WELL.

12:20.567 --> 12:22.000
- HEY, LOOK,
DON'T WORRY, DEB.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.333
I SPOKE WITH
THE ARRESTING OFFICER.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.933
BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

12:24.933 --> 12:27.233
HE SAID HE'S NOT GOING
TO PURSUE THE CRIMINAL CHARGES.

12:27.233 --> 12:29.667
- OH, ROBERT, THAT'S GREAT.

12:29.667 --> 12:30.867
THANK YOU.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.467
- WAIT A MINUTE, ROBERT.

12:32.467 --> 12:35.767
THEY'RE DROPPING THE CHARGES?

12:35.767 --> 12:39.133
IS THAT WISE?

12:39.133 --> 12:42.833
I MEAN, HOW ELSE
IS SHE GONNA LEARN?

12:42.833 --> 12:44.467
- WELL, WE'RE NOT
OUT OF THE WOODS YET.

12:44.467 --> 12:46.233
SHE STILL HAS TO GO
TO THE HEARING AT THE DMV.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.667
- WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

12:47.667 --> 12:49.800
- TO DETERMINE WHEN
SHE GETS HER LICENSE BACK.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.000
- BACK?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.300
YOU MEAN I DON'T HAVE A LICENSE?

12:52.300 --> 12:54.700
- OF COURSE NOT!
- MA!

12:54.700 --> 12:57.633
- YOU MEAN I CAN'T DRIVE
UNTIL THE HEARING?

12:57.633 --> 12:58.833
WHEN IS THAT?

12:58.833 --> 13:01.033
- NEXT MONTH.
- OH, NO.

13:01.033 --> 13:02.533
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.833
WHAT ABOUT THE ERRANDS
AND THE KIDS AND ALL THEIR CRAP?

13:05.833 --> 13:07.033
OH, NO!

13:07.033 --> 13:08.500
WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN TO ME?

13:10.067 --> 13:11.533
- I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, RAY.

13:11.533 --> 13:12.867
- HOW?

13:12.867 --> 13:14.767
BY THE WAY, I'M GOING
ON THE ROAD WITH THE METS.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.133
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY'S GOT TO
DRIVE YOU AND THE KIDS AROUND.

13:17.133 --> 13:18.333
- I'LL DO IT.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.767
SHE CAN TELL ME
ABOUT THE BIG HOUSE.

13:22.433 --> 13:25.467
- WE DON'T LIKE YOU
DRIVING THE CHILDREN, DAD.

13:25.467 --> 13:26.467
- WHY?

13:26.467 --> 13:28.000
BECAUSE I TELL IT LIKE IT IS?

13:31.167 --> 13:33.000
- WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU, MA?

13:33.000 --> 13:36.567
- OF COURSE
I'LL DRIVE DEBRA,

13:36.567 --> 13:40.400
IF SHE NEEDS ME.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.600
WILL DEBRA SAY
SHE NEEDS ME?

13:52.267 --> 13:53.467
- THANK YOU, MARIE.

13:53.467 --> 13:56.700
IT'S A VERY GENEROUS OFFER.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.033
- AND?

14:02.900 --> 14:05.633
- AND I ACCEPT

14:05.633 --> 14:07.433
BECAUSE I...

14:07.433 --> 14:10.567
NEED YOU.

14:10.567 --> 14:16.767
- HAPPY TO DO IT.

14:16.767 --> 14:18.800
- GOOD NIGHT.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.933
- OH, THAT'S IT, DEAR.

14:20.933 --> 14:25.000
GO SLEEP IT OFF.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.800
BOYS, YOU GOT TO HELP ME.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.500
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS A DRY HOUSE.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.400
NOW, WE DON'T NEED THIS IN HERE.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.400
- MA!

14:31.400 --> 14:33.100
PLEASE, MA, WILL YOU RELAX?

14:33.100 --> 14:34.600
SHE'S NOT AN ALCOHOLIC.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.967
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE
FOR HER ANYMORE, RAYMOND.

14:37.967 --> 14:39.167
ROBBIE, GO UPSTAIRS

14:39.167 --> 14:40.733
BEFORE SHE GETS
TO THE COUGH SYRUP.

14:49.633 --> 14:51.767
- OKAY, HOW DO I LOOK?

14:51.767 --> 14:52.967
IS MY HAIR OKAY?

14:52.967 --> 14:54.600
- YOU LOOK FINE.
RELAX.

14:54.600 --> 14:59.000
ALTHOUGH MAYBE YOU
COULD'VE SEXED IT UP A BIT.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.300
- YOU'RE A BIG HELP.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.800
I HAVE GOT TO GET
MY LICENSE BACK.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.767
IF I SPEND ONE MORE DAY
IN THE CAR WITH YOUR MOTHER,

15:03.767 --> 15:09.667
IT'S GONNA BE IN THE GARAGE
WITH THE DOOR CLOSED.

15:09.667 --> 15:10.733
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

15:10.733 --> 15:12.300
I'M MR. RODELL,
THE HEARING OFFICER.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.600
THIS IS MS. ALVAREZ.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.367
I BELIEVE YOU'VE MET
OFFICER KEON.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.267
- YES, HELLO,
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

15:17.267 --> 15:18.933
- YOU, SIT THERE.

15:18.933 --> 15:22.233
YOU, BACK THERE.

15:22.233 --> 15:23.800
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

15:23.800 --> 15:27.033
- YEAH, HE SEEMS NICE.

15:27.033 --> 15:28.500
- UNDO A COUPLE BUTTONS.

15:30.967 --> 15:32.867
- WE'RE HERE.
WE'RE HERE.

15:32.867 --> 15:34.467
DID IT START YET?

15:34.467 --> 15:35.833
- MARIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:35.833 --> 15:39.300
- I WOULDN'T MISS THIS
FOR THE WORLD.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.500
- MA, DAD,
SIT IN THE BACK ROW.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.033
- BUT I'M THE MOTHER-IN-LAW.

15:43.033 --> 15:44.467
- IT'S NOT A WEDDING, MA.

15:44.467 --> 15:47.033
BACK HERE.

15:47.033 --> 15:50.567
- YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN MAY, AREN'T YOU, BARONE?

15:50.567 --> 15:51.700
- YEAH, I KNOW.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.800
I KNOW, KEON, AND, SEE,
I WAS GONNA INVITE YOU,

15:53.800 --> 15:55.267
BUT IF I INVITE YOU,

15:55.267 --> 15:58.800
THEN I HAVE TO INVITE
EVERYONE IN THE K-9 UNIT,

15:58.800 --> 16:02.900
AND THEN WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITH THE BOMB SQUAD?

16:02.900 --> 16:04.100
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, MAN.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.500
I'M JUST BUSTING YOUR CHOPS.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.700
[laughing]

16:06.700 --> 16:08.033
- THAT WAS A GOOD ONE!

16:12.800 --> 16:14.033
- ALL RIGHT, I'VE READ--

16:14.033 --> 16:19.667
- YOU WILL SPEAK UP,
WON'T YOU?

16:19.667 --> 16:21.400
- I'VE READ THE REPORT.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.600
OPERATING A VEHICLE
UNDER THE INFLUENCE.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.000
- EXCUSE ME, SIR.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.667
IS THAT WHAT IT SAYS?

16:27.667 --> 16:29.267
"OPERATING A VEHICLE"?

16:29.267 --> 16:31.067
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT TRUE.

16:31.067 --> 16:33.367
I WASN'T OPERATING A VEHICLE.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.733
I OPERATED PARTS
OF THE VEHICLE--

16:35.733 --> 16:38.100
THE RADIO AND THE SEAT--

16:38.100 --> 16:39.300
BUT THEN I FELL ASLEEP.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.600
- YOU PASSED OUT.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.667
- OH, NO, NO,
I DIDN'T PASS OUT.

16:42.667 --> 16:43.933
I TOOK A NAP.

16:43.933 --> 16:45.733
IN FACT, I CAN PROVE IT

16:45.733 --> 16:48.467
BECAUSE MY HANDS WERE LIKE THIS,

16:48.467 --> 16:50.567
AND YOU DON'T DO THAT
WHEN YOU PASS OUT.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.367
WHEN YOU PASS OUT,
YOU'RE MORE LIKE--

16:52.367 --> 16:53.500
[groans]

16:56.800 --> 16:58.800
I EVEN RECLINED THE SEAT.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.167
THAT SHOULD BE IN THE REPORT

17:00.167 --> 17:02.133
BECAUSE THAT CLEARLY SHOWS...

17:02.133 --> 17:03.567
INTENT TO NAP.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.100
SIR, WEREN'T MY HANDS
LIKE THIS?

17:09.500 --> 17:11.367
- SHE SHOULD'VE
LAWYERED UP.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.667
- YOU DIDN'T BRUSH
YOUR TEETH TODAY, DID YOU?

17:24.200 --> 17:27.400
- DO YOU MAKE A HABIT
OF DRINKING,

17:27.400 --> 17:29.367
GETTING BEHIND
THE WHEEL OF A CAR,

17:29.367 --> 17:31.067
PUTTING THE KEY
IN THE IGNITION,

17:31.067 --> 17:32.700
AND THEN TAKING A NAP?

17:32.700 --> 17:34.000
- OH, NO, NO.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.533
NO, THAT'S NOT A HABIT OF MINE.

17:35.533 --> 17:37.433
THERE WAS JUST NO ONE
I COULD CALL FOR A RIDE HOME.

17:37.433 --> 17:39.333
- THERE ARE CABS, MRS. BARONE.

17:39.333 --> 17:42.733
- YES, AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A GOOD IDEA,

17:42.733 --> 17:45.600
BUT, YOU SEE,
I COULDN'T CALL ONE

17:45.600 --> 17:48.300
BECAUSE, WELL,

17:48.300 --> 17:51.067
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW LIVES
ACROSS THE STREET,

17:51.067 --> 17:52.633
AND SHE WOULD HAVE
SEEN THE CAB,

17:52.633 --> 17:56.433
AND THEN I NEVER WOULD HAVE
HEARD THE END OF IT.

17:56.433 --> 17:59.467
- MRS. BARONE, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW.

17:59.467 --> 18:01.100
- YES, BUT I'M JUST TRYING
TO SHOW YOU--

18:01.100 --> 18:03.500
- THIS IS ABOUT YOUR LICENSE.

18:05.567 --> 18:06.767
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:06.767 --> 18:08.800
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.333
IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY,
AND I SCREWED UP.

18:16.367 --> 18:18.567
- DEBRA.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.100
DEBRA.
- WHAT?

18:20.100 --> 18:21.500
- DO YOU NEED MY HELP?

18:21.500 --> 18:24.100
- GOD, NO!

18:24.100 --> 18:28.100
- SIR, WE HAVE HER DRINKING
COMPLETELY UNDER CONTROL NOW.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.833
- RAY!

18:29.833 --> 18:31.500
- OPEN YOUR SHIRT.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.633
- THIS--

18:36.600 --> 18:38.433
- MRS. BARONE--

18:38.433 --> 18:40.867
- THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT SHE DID AT THE SHOWER!

18:40.867 --> 18:43.067
THIS IS WHAT
SHE ALWAYS DOES!

18:43.067 --> 18:44.667
SHE JUST HAS TO
RUN MY LIFE.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.500
THAT'S WHY I YELLED AT HER
AT THE SHOWER,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.367
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T
CALL HER FOR A RIDE HOME,

18:48.367 --> 18:50.167
AND THAT'S WHY
I AM HERE, SIR.

18:50.167 --> 18:51.767
YES, I HAD A FEW DRINKS.

18:51.767 --> 18:54.733
I SHOULD BE DRUNK EVERY DAY!

18:56.733 --> 18:58.100
BUT I'M NOT

18:58.100 --> 19:00.633
BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE
A DRINKING PROBLEM, SIR.

19:00.633 --> 19:01.833
WHAT I HAVE

19:01.833 --> 19:03.733
IS A MOTHER-IN-LAW PROBLEM!

19:09.800 --> 19:11.867
- SIR, SHE'S RIGHT.

19:11.867 --> 19:13.067
I WAS WRONG.

19:13.067 --> 19:14.300
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MA'AM.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.167
- NO, NO, NO.
IT'S MY FAULT,

19:16.167 --> 19:20.133
AND I WANT TO ACCEPT
COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY.

19:20.133 --> 19:22.067
- WELL, YOU CAN'T, BUT THANKS.

19:23.767 --> 19:26.433
- I JUST WANTED AMY'S SHOWER
TO BE SPECIAL.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.033
THAT'S WHY I MADE
ALL THOSE APPETIZERS,

19:29.033 --> 19:32.000
LIKE THE CAPRESE
AND THE STUFFED MUSHROOMS.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.567
DID YOU GET ANY OF THOSE?

19:34.567 --> 19:36.833
- EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A FULL SCHEDULE.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.133
- THIS IS IMPORTANT.

19:39.133 --> 19:42.300
I KNOW I TOOK OVER
A LITTLE TOO MUCH,

19:42.300 --> 19:44.233
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT MY PLACE WAS

19:44.233 --> 19:45.433
AT THAT BRIDAL SHOWER.

19:45.433 --> 19:46.967
- IT'S OKAY, MARIE.

19:46.967 --> 19:49.200
- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.267
IT WAS YOUR PARTY.

19:51.267 --> 19:53.300
I SHOULD HAVE
JUST STEPPED ASIDE

19:53.300 --> 19:56.233
AND LET YOU SERVE
YOUR FROZEN WHATEVERS.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.133
I'M SORRY.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.833
- THANKS, MARIE.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.167
- YOU GETTING ALL THIS?

20:11.133 --> 20:12.467
- I'M SORRY, SIR.

20:12.467 --> 20:14.533
- NO, NO, I THINK
SHE MIGHT HAVE HELPED.

20:14.533 --> 20:19.167
I NOW FULLY UNDERSTAND YOUR
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES--

20:20.233 --> 20:22.433
WHICH HAS NO BEARING
ON THE CASE,

20:22.433 --> 20:25.900
BUT I DO BELIEVE
THAT YOU DID HAVE

20:25.900 --> 20:28.500
INTENT TO NAP.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.967
I'M RETURNING YOUR LICENSE,

20:29.967 --> 20:31.167
SUBJECT TO
A YEAR'S PROBATION.

20:31.167 --> 20:34.300
[cheering and laughter]

20:34.300 --> 20:35.967
GOOD-BYE, EVERYBODY,

20:35.967 --> 20:39.633
AND GOOD LUCK TO WHOEVER'S
MARRYING INTO THIS.

20:39.633 --> 20:40.833
- THANK YOU.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.233
THANK YOU!

20:42.233 --> 20:44.100
OH, WASN'T THAT SOMETHING?

20:44.100 --> 20:46.033
- YES, IT WAS.

20:46.033 --> 20:48.100
YOU REALLY DONEED ME.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.167
DEBRA, I MUST SAY,
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD MEAL.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.533
- MY PLEASURE, MARIE.

20:57.533 --> 21:00.367
AND YOUR MOUSSE IS FANTASTIC.

21:00.367 --> 21:05.400
- YOU KNOW, THE MOOSE IS
ACTUALLY A VERY VICIOUS ANIMAL,

21:05.400 --> 21:08.000
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR ANTLERS
YOU GOT TO WATCH OUT FOR.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.033
THEY USE THEIR GAS.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.700
- YOU AND A MOOSE
WOULD BE A GOOD FIGHT.

21:27.633 --> 21:29.933
- REALLY, MA,
THIS IS SCRUMPTIOUS.

21:29.933 --> 21:31.800
RICH.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.000
- THAT'S BECAUSE I USE
REAL VALRHONA CHOCOLATE,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.967
AND I EVEN ADDED SOME BRANDY.

21:37.967 --> 21:39.300
NO!
