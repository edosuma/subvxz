WEBVTT

00:10.445 --> 00:11.881
Oh, hell, no.

00:11.924 --> 00:14.927
- When I was back there.
- Right.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.364
What are you doing in my house?

00:16.407 --> 00:17.974
Archie, don't be rude.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.584
I was just talking
to your uncle about the, uh,

00:19.628 --> 00:21.282
the town-wide census
I'm conducting.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.111
Census?

00:24.154 --> 00:25.721
Under what authority?

00:25.764 --> 00:26.896
With council approval.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.767
Well, Alice and Frank.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.944
I can assure you,
the questions are standard.

00:31.988 --> 00:34.077
How long have you
lived in Riverdale?

00:34.121 --> 00:37.080
What problems are
you most concerned with
in your neighborhood?

00:37.124 --> 00:40.301
And people's answers
will help guide the council.

00:40.344 --> 00:42.433
And of course, I'll get
to meet my neighbors.

00:42.477 --> 00:46.568
Door by door. Face by face.

00:46.611 --> 00:49.832
Tell me, Archie.
Would you like to
answer some questions?

00:51.007 --> 00:52.139
No.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.488
I would not.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.317
And I'd like you to leave.

00:58.319 --> 00:59.276
Now.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.412
I gotta say
I'm shocked, Archie.

01:05.282 --> 01:06.762
He is not a good guy.

01:06.805 --> 01:09.895
Oh, good grief, Archie!

01:09.939 --> 01:12.376
You've clearly made up
your mind against Percival.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.161
It's a shame.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.076
He has a lot of great ideas
about how to make Riverdale

01:16.119 --> 01:17.251
a better place to live.

01:25.607 --> 01:28.392
It's damp and chilly,
Mistress Abigail.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.046
Why don't we
go back to Thornhill?

01:30.090 --> 01:32.701
I'll brew you some of that
yummy tea that you like,

01:32.744 --> 01:34.094
and we'll get you
warm and cozy.

01:34.137 --> 01:37.923
No, as restorative
as your tea is,

01:37.967 --> 01:39.360
it's time to vanquish
my enemies

01:39.403 --> 01:41.536
and be reunited
with my Thomasina.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.062
How?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.020
I shall reincarnate
Thomasina's soul

01:48.064 --> 01:50.022
into Toni Topaz's body.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.285
The blood moon
will be rising soon.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.765
Perfect time
for reincarnation spell.

01:53.809 --> 01:56.072
And once my beloved
has returned to me,

01:56.116 --> 01:58.379
together, we will slay
Fangs Fogarty.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.991
And seal our love
for all eternity.

02:02.034 --> 02:05.168
And is Mr. Fogarty
the only, um,

02:05.212 --> 02:07.301
enemy you wish to vanquish?

02:07.344 --> 02:10.434
No. There are still the three
descendants of my assassins.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.089
Come along, Brittania.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.090
Ah!

02:26.058 --> 02:27.886
You're in a good mood today.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.801
I am.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.195
I just spoke to my dad
and he wants
to visit the casino.

02:32.239 --> 02:35.024
Really? How's his health?

02:35.067 --> 02:39.028
He's on the mend,
but it's like he lost his mojo.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.812
The truth is,

02:40.856 --> 02:43.989
my dad's always
wanted to feel
like the big shot.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.948
That's what's most important.

02:45.991 --> 02:48.255
To make him feel like one.

02:48.298 --> 02:52.172
Well, in that case,
leave it to me.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.478
The Sheriff's Department
is pleased to announce

02:54.522 --> 02:56.350
that the town-wide census
is complete,

02:56.393 --> 02:58.787
and the people
of Riverdale have spoken.

02:58.830 --> 03:03.400
And since the unhoused problem
has been dealt with,

03:03.444 --> 03:07.012
their main source of anxiety
is the ongoing gang warfare

03:07.056 --> 03:08.536
between the Serpents
and the Ghoulies.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.843
Miss Topaz,

03:11.887 --> 03:14.629
since you're a member
of the Council of Four
and Serpent Queen,

03:14.672 --> 03:16.152
what have you got
to say about that?

03:17.675 --> 03:19.111
Well, to begin with,
there is no war

03:19.155 --> 03:21.810
between the Serpents
and the Ghoulies.

03:21.853 --> 03:24.421
Actually, I've been
in constant contact
with the Ghoulies' leader,

03:24.465 --> 03:28.251
Twyla Twyst, in efforts
to de-escalate tension.

03:28.295 --> 03:31.428
And I believe we're very close
to declaring a ceasefire.

03:31.472 --> 03:34.779
Well, I wonder,
have you considered
disbanding the Serpents?

03:36.259 --> 03:39.262
Okay, if I could just
interject here,

03:39.306 --> 03:41.830
Miss Topaz is not on trial.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.266
Your point has been noted,

03:43.310 --> 03:45.529
Mr. Pickens.

03:45.573 --> 03:48.402
Now let's please move on
to the next item on our agenda.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.495
What the hell was that?

03:54.538 --> 03:56.018
An ambush.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.889
Percival went after
the folks in Sketch Alley

03:57.933 --> 03:59.021
and now he's coming after us.

03:59.064 --> 04:00.805
Hey, Toni. Fangs.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.982
Oh, hey, Prince!

04:04.026 --> 04:06.985
How is my baby boy doing?

04:07.029 --> 04:09.031
Yeah, he's great. He's great.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.033
I'm bummed to let him go.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.383
Nervous, given
everything going on.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.298
Oh, don't be.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.909
I gotta be honest.
I'm having second thoughts

04:17.953 --> 04:22.218
about Baby Anthony being raised
around gang culture.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.524
You mean as a Serpent?

04:23.567 --> 04:26.309
Kevin, I was raised
as a Serpent.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.006
So was Fangs.

04:28.050 --> 04:30.182
I know. I know. I'm just...
concerned for his safety.

04:30.226 --> 04:31.140
That's all.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.884
Welcome to
Babylonium, Mr. Mantle.

04:35.927 --> 04:38.974
And here we are,
our best table,

04:39.017 --> 04:40.410
and our best dealer,

04:40.454 --> 04:43.544
Ryan. He's one of my favorites.

04:43.587 --> 04:46.068
Is there anything else
we can get for you, Mr. Mantle?

04:46.111 --> 04:48.331
No. This is all
very impressive.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.854
We aim to please.

04:49.898 --> 04:51.116
I'll come by
to check on you later.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.727
But in the meantime, have fun.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.514
<i>Thanks for</i> <i>
hanging back, you guys.</i>

04:57.558 --> 05:00.822
Something very, very weird
is happening in Riverdale.

05:00.865 --> 05:04.260
You mean, besides us suddenly
developing mutant abilities?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.828
I'm talking
about Percival Pickens.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.830
You heard him. He's been
going around door to door

05:08.873 --> 05:12.268
meeting with everyone in town,
trying to recruit them.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.965
Your mom, my Uncle Frank,

05:14.009 --> 05:16.098
Sheriff Keller.
God knows who else.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.969
Ever since Percival
sensed me in his mind,

05:18.013 --> 05:19.406
I've been doing some...

05:19.449 --> 05:21.669
research on heightened
psychic abilities.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.280
You know, some people think
that mind control
is a real thing,

05:24.324 --> 05:26.587
like a skill,
the power of persuasion.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.937
But persuading people
to do what?

05:28.980 --> 05:31.853
What does Percival want
with Riverdale?

05:31.896 --> 05:34.116
His family was
one of the original
settlers of the town.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.335
Maybe he feels like
he has a claim to it?

05:35.378 --> 05:38.903
Whatever it is, it's not good.

05:38.947 --> 05:42.690
Jug, if he really made
your friend Doc attack Kev,

05:42.733 --> 05:44.518
what's to say
he didn't compel the people

05:44.561 --> 05:46.650
of Sketch Alley to up
and leave the same way?

05:46.694 --> 05:49.697
I mean, if he really
can control people's thoughts,
and actions--

05:49.740 --> 05:51.089
Yeah, he needs to be stopped.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.831
Classic superhero narrative.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.094
Okay, Betty, can we
throw this guy in jail?

05:56.138 --> 05:57.661
- You're the FBI.
- Yeah,

05:57.705 --> 05:59.271
but not if we can't prove
he's breaking any laws.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.535
All right, then.
Archie, you are invulnerable.

06:01.578 --> 06:02.884
Let's beat this guy up.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.015
Break every bone in his body.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.060
I can't do that, Jug.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.018
I'd be just as bad as he is.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.977
Besides, we tried
both of those things
with Hiram repeatedly.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.196
They're temporary solutions
at best.

06:11.240 --> 06:14.069
Percival is going around
recruiting people for whatever
big play he's got.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.723
What if we do the same thing?

06:15.766 --> 06:17.420
We go to our friends,

06:17.464 --> 06:18.987
the people we trust,

06:19.030 --> 06:20.815
make sure that he's not
turning them to his side.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.512
In the short term,
it would stop Percival

06:22.556 --> 06:24.427
from amassing
too much power too quickly.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.735
We'd be concerned citizens
talking to our neighbors.

06:27.778 --> 06:31.042
Guys, what if this is why
we were given our powers?

06:31.086 --> 06:32.653
To protect the town
from Percival.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.091
Okay, relax, Professor Xavier.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.139
Who do we start with?

06:41.183 --> 06:43.403
<i>Well,</i> <i>
isn't this fortuitous?</i>

06:43.446 --> 06:46.231
Cheryl, have you had any
private contact

06:46.275 --> 06:49.147
with Percival Pickens?

06:49.191 --> 06:50.758
Did he stop by
to interview you?

06:50.801 --> 06:52.237
For his census?

06:52.281 --> 06:53.935
Yes, but I was taking
a buttermilk bath,

06:53.978 --> 06:54.979
so I couldn't receive him.

06:55.023 --> 06:57.242
Why for?

06:57.286 --> 07:01.595
We're worried that
his intentions for Riverdale
may not be above board.

07:01.638 --> 07:04.728
We think he is recruiting
people to his side.

07:05.860 --> 07:09.211
For some nefarious agenda?

07:09.254 --> 07:11.474
Honestly, I'd be more worried
about an angry mob dragging me

07:11.518 --> 07:14.259
into the forest
in the middle of the night
and burning me at the stake.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.913
As Archibald Andrews,
Jedediah Jones

07:15.957 --> 07:19.439
and Beatrice Cooper
did to my ancestor.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.744
Not this again.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.616
Yes, again.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.748
That transgression
hasn't been settled
or forgotten.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.490
Okay, will you just
let us know if Percival

07:27.534 --> 07:29.840
tries to influence you
in any way?

07:29.884 --> 07:31.146
And for what?

07:31.189 --> 07:33.148
Regarding Mr. Pickens,

07:33.191 --> 07:36.107
I'll keep my own counsel
as I always have.

07:36.151 --> 07:40.329
And as for you three,
my patience, and this audience
is at an end.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.200
Come on, Cheryl.
We're the good guys.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.116
Spoken like a true villain.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.251
Let me show you the door.

07:54.386 --> 07:57.389
Stoke the fires
and heat the ovens, Brittania.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.522
We're preparing
arsenic-laced scones.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.829
For who?

08:01.872 --> 08:05.006
For that unholy trinity
of self-obsessed malefactors.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.399
The timing couldn't be
more perfect.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.489
I need a corpse
for my reincarnation ritual.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.102
Hurry now. Lest we bake
a scone for you, too.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.834
Toni, where are you right now?

08:50.878 --> 08:53.358
At school. Why? What's up?

08:53.402 --> 08:55.186
Don't tell me more trouble
with the Ghoulies.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.536
Not the Ghoulies.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.886
But I just got
a call from Alice.

08:58.929 --> 09:02.367
She and Frank are convening
an emergency meeting
of the council.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.152
Why wasn't I told about this?

09:04.195 --> 09:07.895
It's because the meeting
is to remove you
from the council.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.288
What? Why?

09:10.332 --> 09:12.900
It's Percival's idea,
says Alice.

09:12.943 --> 09:16.556
He's using the drive-by
last night as an excuse.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.427
What's his grudge with me?

09:18.470 --> 09:21.386
I don't know. I mean,
you're a pillar
of the community,

09:21.430 --> 09:24.085
and maybe he sees you
as a threat.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.478
<i>At any rate, it is</i> <i>
classic fear mongering,</i>

09:26.522 --> 09:29.220
<i>and that is why you need to</i> <i>
come with me to this meeting.</i>

09:29.264 --> 09:30.308
I'm on my way.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.442
What's going on?

09:33.485 --> 09:35.618
We want to talk
about Percival Pickens.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.228
We don't think he's a good guy.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.579
Did he come by here
for his census

09:39.622 --> 09:41.798
to put ideas into your head

09:41.842 --> 09:43.931
or try to shift
your point of view?

09:43.974 --> 09:45.802
Or to recruit you for anything?

09:46.542 --> 09:49.110
No and no.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.286
But...

09:51.329 --> 09:55.159
the male Mary Poppins
is definitely up to
some serious shadiness.

09:55.203 --> 09:56.770
Why do you say that?

09:56.813 --> 10:01.035
I had one of my associates
look into him for me.

10:01.078 --> 10:02.776
And Percival...

10:03.603 --> 10:05.561
doesn't exist.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.607
There's literally
no trace of him

10:07.650 --> 10:09.086
before he showed up
in Riverdale.

10:09.130 --> 10:13.134
And this sounds crazy, but...

10:13.177 --> 10:15.745
he said something
to one of our clients.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.268
I don't know what.

10:17.312 --> 10:20.141
And then that client...

10:23.187 --> 10:24.275
killed himself.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.629
Okay. Now, can we
beat this guy up?

10:29.672 --> 10:30.673
Get him thrown in jail?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.675
How does he even have powers?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.329
We were in that explosion.

10:34.372 --> 10:35.852
Not that that makes sense.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.593
None of this makes sense.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.204
But how can Percival
control people's minds?

10:47.081 --> 10:49.300
It's Tabitha. She says we need
to go to the El Royale.

10:54.088 --> 10:56.351
Thank you for assembling.

10:56.394 --> 10:59.615
We've all heard about
the act of gang violence
that happened

10:59.659 --> 11:02.009
at Pop's just last night.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.967
And in response
to that incident,

11:04.011 --> 11:06.535
Percival Pickens would like
to submit a motion.

11:08.668 --> 11:13.063
My motion is for the immediate
removal of Antoinette Topaz

11:13.107 --> 11:14.543
from the Council of Four.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.199
How can Riverdale feel safe

11:18.242 --> 11:20.549
with a known gang member
shaping town policy?

11:20.592 --> 11:24.771
I think Toni can
and should speak for herself.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.337
Thank you, Tabitha.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.953
Mr. Pickens,
I know you're new here.

11:32.996 --> 11:36.478
But I have spent my entire life
in service to Riverdale.

11:36.521 --> 11:40.612
After high school,
I graduated college
with a degree in social work.

11:40.656 --> 11:44.312
I then became
guidance counselor
at Riverdale High.

11:44.355 --> 11:48.316
I kept its doors open
as Hiram Lodge fought
to shut us down.

11:48.359 --> 11:50.753
I then used my position
as a small business owner

11:50.797 --> 11:54.757
and proud member
of the LGBTQIA+ community.

11:54.801 --> 11:58.282
to help with various
charities and organizations.

11:58.326 --> 12:01.764
And if there's any doubt
about my integrity,

12:01.808 --> 12:05.246
just know that
I'm raising my son here,

12:05.289 --> 12:07.901
and I'm invested in Riverdale
because of him.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.600
And I hope you all let me
continue to advocate

12:11.643 --> 12:14.342
for you and this town.

12:15.604 --> 12:16.518
Thank you.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.611
Well, let's put it to a vote.

12:22.654 --> 12:23.743
See what happens.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.753
Miss Lodge,

12:33.796 --> 12:36.843
sorry to interrupt,
but Mister Mantle is back

12:36.886 --> 12:39.584
at table 12
and he's in pretty deep.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.630
to the tune of $7,000.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.504
All right. I will deal with it.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.549
Thank you.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.815
Mom.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.557
- Oh, hey, honey.
- Hey, uh, what's going on?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.559
We heard from Tabitha
that there was a meeting.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.126
Uh, yeah, there was.

12:59.169 --> 13:01.650
Unfortunately, Toni
was voted off the council.

13:03.478 --> 13:06.611
And let me guess, Alice.
This was Percival's idea?

13:06.655 --> 13:09.397
Except for Tabitha, it was
a unanimous vote, Archie.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.659
Unanimous?

13:12.182 --> 13:13.836
Against Toni?
How is that possible?

13:16.143 --> 13:18.188
Ah!

13:21.583 --> 13:23.411
How are you boys doing
over here?

13:23.454 --> 13:24.978
The House is calling
for a break.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.815
How are you feeling,
Mr. Mantle?
Are you doing okay?

13:37.599 --> 13:39.035
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

13:39.079 --> 13:40.689
Um...

13:40.732 --> 13:43.126
I'm a little bit down,
but my luck is turning.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.302
I can... I can feel it.

13:45.346 --> 13:48.175
As a matter of fact,
I was wondering
whether or not

13:48.218 --> 13:51.265
you guys could float me,
maybe $5,000?

13:53.354 --> 13:58.838
Oh, uh, we don't really
do that here.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.144
But maybe you should
step away from the table

14:01.188 --> 14:03.451
and slow down a bit,
you know, cut your losses.

14:03.494 --> 14:08.412
So, you're throwing me
out of my own son's casino?

14:08.456 --> 14:10.458
You're going to embarrass me
in front of these guys.

14:13.156 --> 14:25.821
<i>♪ Baby did a bad bad thing</i>

14:25.865 --> 14:27.475
<i>♪ You ever love</i> <i>
Someone so much ♪</i>

14:27.518 --> 14:28.606
<i>♪ You thought</i> <i>
Your little heart... ♪</i>

14:28.650 --> 14:31.174
Archie Andrews.

14:31.218 --> 14:35.004
Just the he-man
I was looking for.

14:35.048 --> 14:38.660
I'm sorry I was so cold to you
at Thornhill yesterday.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.923
May I interest you
in an apology treat?

14:43.056 --> 14:44.187
- <i>Dearest Jug-
- Jug,</i>

14:46.581 --> 14:49.149
may I offer you
a sugary sweet mea culpa

14:49.192 --> 14:51.107
for my foul mood yesterday?

14:53.980 --> 14:55.329
Sweet cousin.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.724
I come bearing gifts
to mend hurt feelings.

15:06.644 --> 15:09.038
What are you doing, Cheryl?

15:09.082 --> 15:11.649
Offering you an olive branch.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.477
Why won't you take one
like your cohorts did?

15:15.479 --> 15:16.828
What did you put
in those scones?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.659
Are you trying to poison me?

15:27.883 --> 15:29.058
"Cohorts."

15:31.191 --> 15:32.453
Jug. Archie.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.892
Don't eat that scone.

15:39.677 --> 15:40.809
I already did.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.029
What's the problem?

15:43.072 --> 15:44.204
I think she poisoned them.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.383
Okay. Well,
I'm invulnerable, remember?

15:49.426 --> 15:50.950
Okay, well, Jughead isn't.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.908
So get a glass of water
and a salt shaker

15:52.952 --> 15:54.301
and meet me
by the bathrooms, okay?

15:55.737 --> 15:57.086
Don't take another bite!

15:58.392 --> 15:59.871
Bathroom. Now.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.615
Cheryl gave us poisoned scones?

16:04.659 --> 16:06.748
- Yeah, we think so.
- Well, yes, I saw her aura, okay?

16:06.791 --> 16:08.750
So drink this
and then throw up.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.366
Just go.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.503
- I have been thinking, Fangs.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.984
What if the Serpents
shed their skin

16:25.027 --> 16:28.639
and rebranded a little bit?

16:28.683 --> 16:34.558
So we no longer be a gang,
which is triggering,

16:34.602 --> 16:36.778
but a political activist group,

16:36.821 --> 16:39.999
like the Black Panthers.

16:40.042 --> 16:44.003
We'd focus more
on community-driven programs

16:44.046 --> 16:46.831
helping the town's youth
and seniors.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.529
Wouldn't we be handing the town

16:48.572 --> 16:50.748
over to the Ghoulies
at that point?

16:50.792 --> 16:53.664
Well, we could ask Betty
for help from the FBI.

16:53.708 --> 16:57.538
You want the FBI
to fight our battles for us?

16:57.581 --> 16:58.887
Where's all this coming from?

16:58.930 --> 17:00.845
Becoming
a political activist group?

17:02.760 --> 17:05.241
It would take the wind
out of the witch hunter sails.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.419
I gotta be honest.

17:09.463 --> 17:10.681
I don't think the Serpents
are gonna go for it, Toni.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.772
They will if we stay
united on this.

17:15.947 --> 17:17.036
Fangs.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.168
Are we?

17:20.778 --> 17:21.736
United?

17:25.914 --> 17:27.176
Oh, my God!

17:31.267 --> 17:32.747
Kevin?

17:32.790 --> 17:34.749
What the hell?
You can't just come in here.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.838
We got a warrant, Fangs.
We received reports

17:36.881 --> 17:38.840
there's illegal weapons
being stored in this apartment.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.190
Weapons?

17:41.234 --> 17:43.410
Absolutely not.
And reports from whom?

17:51.331 --> 17:53.681
- I'll check the baby's room.
- The hell you will!

17:53.724 --> 17:55.204
That's it. He's done.

17:55.248 --> 17:56.075
Come on.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.774
What the hell? Let him go.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.692
Kevin, why are you doing this?

18:20.534 --> 18:22.318
Fangs,
I'm going to get you
out of here no matter what.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.493
But I need to know.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.540
Where did the weapons
come from?

18:29.934 --> 18:31.022
They were mine.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.375
Fangs, why?

18:37.028 --> 18:40.728
In our house?
With Baby Anthony?

18:40.771 --> 18:43.209
I was storing them.

18:43.252 --> 18:45.950
For a battle royale
with the Ghoulies.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.648
You stopped talking
to Twyla Twyst,

18:47.691 --> 18:51.391
but she reached out to me,
challenged me to a rumble.

18:51.434 --> 18:54.307
The other Serpents?
They want to fight.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.181
I'm sorry, Toni.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.020
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.630
How's the scene
at the casino?

19:13.674 --> 19:15.458
Dad said he had a blast again.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.853
To be honest...

19:19.810 --> 19:21.160
We kind of had a moment.

19:22.683 --> 19:25.033
He was losing a lot of money.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.992
And I asked him
if he wanted to step away.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.995
He didn't
and it's not a big deal, but...

19:32.258 --> 19:33.607
it kind of got me wondering,

19:33.650 --> 19:36.175
how did your dad
get into debt with my dad?

19:37.132 --> 19:39.178
Was it gambling?

19:39.221 --> 19:41.441
He was making
capital improvements
to the car lot

19:41.484 --> 19:43.182
and the bank didn't want
to give him a loan.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.750
Damn, Ronnie.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.578
The guy's finally
having a good time,
and you want to squash that?

19:50.232 --> 19:51.320
Not at all.

19:52.669 --> 19:55.411
I only wanted to make sure
he was okay.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.500
Trust me, he's fine.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.859
Horrid news about Archie,
Betty and Jughead.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.731
Oh, no. Are they?

20:10.774 --> 20:12.689
Very much alive, I'm afraid.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.474
How, I have no clue.

20:14.517 --> 20:15.649
No matter.

20:15.692 --> 20:18.260
Tomorrow I shall
pay Toni a visit.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.784
I need some of her blood
for my rituals.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.657
Does that mean that you're done
trying to kill the others?

20:23.700 --> 20:25.180
Of course not.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.444
I still hate them,
and I still need a body.

20:28.488 --> 20:32.100
It's just a matter of devising
how I might go about
vanquishing them.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.890
How are you feeling, Jug?

20:39.934 --> 20:41.283
Like I swam in the ocean

20:41.327 --> 20:43.503
and swallowed
a bunch of sea water.

20:43.546 --> 20:44.808
It was the best way
to flush Cheryl's

20:44.852 --> 20:46.419
poison out of your system.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.596
Why is Cheryl trying
to kill us all of a sudden?

20:49.639 --> 20:53.774
Because of something
that happened to Abigail
centuries ago?

20:53.817 --> 20:55.645
- Really?
- Or it was Percival.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.909
I mean, maybe he got to her,
suggested that she take us out.

20:58.953 --> 21:00.259
And what better way
to get rid of us

21:00.302 --> 21:01.564
without leaving
any fingerprints?

21:01.608 --> 21:03.566
Well, there's one way
to find out.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.438
Jug, you can't
read Percival's mind
because he'll sense it.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.657
But maybe try reading Cheryl's?

21:07.701 --> 21:09.659
Maybe you'll pick up
some trace of Percival?

21:09.703 --> 21:11.182
Yeah, I'll do it.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.663
Just let me get
my sea legs back first.

21:17.014 --> 21:19.669
Behold. A bouquet of roses
so beautiful,

21:19.713 --> 21:22.411
they needed your presence
to keep them company.

21:22.455 --> 21:25.109
Cheryl,
what's the occasion?

21:25.153 --> 21:28.374
Oh, I just had a sixth sense
that you need a pick-me-up.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.331
Was I wrong?

21:30.289 --> 21:33.161
No, on the contrary, I...

21:33.204 --> 21:34.293
Ow!

21:34.336 --> 21:35.816
Oh, no.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.992
Do those roses
still have thorns?

21:38.035 --> 21:39.559
Poor hand. Let me see.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.738
Pray, tell, what ails you?

21:46.957 --> 21:49.133
I got voted off the council.

21:49.177 --> 21:52.180
Fangs is in jail,
and the Ghoulies

21:52.223 --> 21:53.790
are determined to start a war
with the Serpents.

21:55.139 --> 21:56.880
Remind me again,
what is the origin

21:56.924 --> 21:59.622
of your troubles
with, um, the Ghoulies?

21:59.666 --> 22:01.276
Most recently?

22:01.320 --> 22:02.669
Well, Archie
went ballistic on them

22:02.712 --> 22:05.280
after they blew up his house.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.674
For all I know, they're still
trying to kill him.

22:07.717 --> 22:10.067
Probably planning
another drive by

22:10.111 --> 22:11.330
even as we speak.

22:11.373 --> 22:14.115
The Ghoulies wish
to kill Archie?

22:15.986 --> 22:17.292
Tell me more about that.

22:18.598 --> 22:19.599
<i>You called, Dad?</i>

22:25.996 --> 22:27.476
I'm in trouble, Reg.

22:29.173 --> 22:30.740
I lost the car lot.

22:31.524 --> 22:32.742
The dealership?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.661
How? When?

22:38.705 --> 22:40.359
Last night.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.537
After we left the casino,

22:44.580 --> 22:47.278
these wise guys invited me
to a private poker game

22:47.322 --> 22:48.410
at Cucina's Casa.

22:48.454 --> 22:49.846
You went with them?

22:49.890 --> 22:51.413
We were having a great time.

22:52.545 --> 22:53.807
Okay.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.809
And one thing led to another,

22:55.852 --> 22:58.551
and... and it was like
that time at the race track.

22:58.594 --> 22:59.856
Remember?

22:59.900 --> 23:02.511
You know, I... I...
I couldn't stop.

23:04.470 --> 23:08.212
The more I lost,
the more I had
to keep on playing.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.262
I was wondering, um...

23:16.090 --> 23:18.092
Maybe you could
talk to Veronica

23:18.135 --> 23:22.488
and she could talk
to the wise guys.

23:22.531 --> 23:25.534
They're sort of her crowd,
aren't they?

23:28.537 --> 23:30.539
Let me see, Dad.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.715
Janet. What can I
help you with?

23:32.759 --> 23:34.238
I hate having to do this, Toni,

23:34.282 --> 23:36.458
but I'm here conducting
a wellness check.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.026
I've been informed this may be

23:39.069 --> 23:41.463
an unsafe environment
for Baby Anthony.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.422
<i>I received</i> <i>
an anonymous complaint.</i>

23:43.465 --> 23:45.162
I'm here on
a wellness check, Toni.

23:45.859 --> 23:46.729
For Baby Anthony.

23:50.341 --> 23:51.604
Toni?

23:51.647 --> 23:52.474
Is everything all right?

23:52.518 --> 23:53.780
Yeah.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.696
Yeah. I was
just having deja vu.

23:56.739 --> 23:59.176
Janet, I don't know
what you've heard,

23:59.220 --> 24:00.613
but I would never do anything

24:00.656 --> 24:03.659
to put Baby Anthony
in harm's way. Ever.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.661
Of course.

24:05.705 --> 24:08.185
But as a social worker,
I have to investigate
every claim.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.188
Where is he now? Can I see him?

24:11.928 --> 24:14.583
Sure, follow me.

24:14.627 --> 24:15.845
He's asleep in his bedroom.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.460
Wait. Where is he?

24:23.374 --> 24:24.593
Toni, the window.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.163
Oh, my God.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.255
Oh, Archibald.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.972
All right, everybody,
listen up.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.626
The Sheriff's department
and the FBI

24:57.670 --> 24:59.933
are leading their own search
for Baby Anthony.

24:59.976 --> 25:03.545
But here in Riverdale,
we take care of our own.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.547
We've divided the town
into a grid,

25:05.591 --> 25:08.376
so we'll hit every house
on every block

25:08.419 --> 25:10.378
until we find Baby Anthony.

25:10.421 --> 25:13.947
This is a 24/7 operation
and we'll be working in shifts.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.818
Let's bring Baby Anthony home.

25:26.046 --> 25:28.918
<i>Poor kid.</i> <i>I hope he's okay.</i>

25:28.962 --> 25:31.791
<i>She's not fit</i> <i>
to be a mother.</i>

25:31.834 --> 25:33.575
<i>She's the leader</i> <i>
of a gang.</i>

25:33.619 --> 25:35.272
<i>Put her child in harm's way.</i>

25:37.361 --> 25:39.581
<i>No one's safe</i> <i>
in this town anymore.</i>

25:45.587 --> 25:47.023
Picking up on anything?

25:47.067 --> 25:48.764
Nothing.

25:48.808 --> 25:50.026
I mean, if the kidnappers
are keeping tabs on the search,

25:50.070 --> 25:51.375
they're not doing it nearby.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.334
But I'll keep looking.

25:53.377 --> 25:57.294
Okay. I'll take a break.
Archie just texted me.
He's outside.

25:57.338 --> 26:00.994
Cheryl, dressed as a Ghoulie,
threw a Molotov cocktail
at you?

26:01.037 --> 26:02.865
It's hard to mistake
Cheryl, Betty.

26:02.909 --> 26:05.346
No matter what she's wearing.

26:05.389 --> 26:07.957
We'll stay here and join
the search for Baby Anthony,

26:08.001 --> 26:09.480
will you please
go read Cheryl's mind now?

26:09.524 --> 26:12.266
Yeah, definitely.
And hope I don't get killed.

26:14.616 --> 26:15.704
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

26:19.490 --> 26:21.797
My dad lost Mantle Motors
to one of Heraldo's

26:21.841 --> 26:23.364
wise guys in a game of poker.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.585
What can we do?

26:29.065 --> 26:32.068
I'll talk to Heraldo's pals.

26:32.112 --> 26:35.855
But now can you admit
that your dad has a problem?

26:35.898 --> 26:37.291
And needs to be cut off?

26:37.334 --> 26:39.728
What?

26:39.772 --> 26:42.383
Your dad killed people
and blew up the entire town

26:42.426 --> 26:43.863
and you hung up his portrait.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.952
But my dad has

26:45.995 --> 26:48.476
a streak of bad luck,
and you want to bar him
from my casino?

26:49.695 --> 26:51.087
You know what?

26:51.131 --> 26:53.394
This is my dad's mess.
I'll handle it.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.669
Hello.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.236
<i>Toni Topaz,</i> <i>
it's your old friend,</i>

27:09.279 --> 27:11.281
<i>Twyla Twyst.</i>

27:11.325 --> 27:13.936
You'll never guess
what cutie patootie
I'm looking at right now.

27:18.245 --> 27:20.726
You have Anthony?
Where are you?

27:20.769 --> 27:24.381
It's time to end this, Topaz.
The Serpents versus
the Ghoulies.

27:24.425 --> 27:25.818
The winner gets Riverdale.

27:27.297 --> 27:30.126
And this little heartbreaker
right here.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.389
Name the place
and I'll be there.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.261
<i>Under one condition.</i>

27:34.304 --> 27:36.916
You deliver Anthony to Pops.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.440
And I'm not going to fight
until I get word
from my friend Tabitha

27:39.483 --> 27:40.615
that Anthony's safe.

27:40.659 --> 27:44.097
- <i>-
- Deal?</i>
- Deal.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.665
See you at 10:00 in front of
the tuna fish warehouse
in the docks.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.363
And come armed.
Because we will be.

27:54.281 --> 27:56.544
I'm not comfortable
with this, Toni.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.198
Can't we at least
loop in Betty?

27:58.241 --> 28:00.940
No. This is how it works.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.724
And this is how it has to be.

28:02.768 --> 28:05.074
And Twyla doesn't want
to hurt Baby Anthony.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.337
She wants bragging rights
that she took me down.

28:07.381 --> 28:09.339
Or the Serpents. Or both.

28:11.428 --> 28:14.475
Okay. Okay, then I will
wait for Baby Anthony,

28:14.518 --> 28:16.477
and then I will call you.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.916
What year
do you think it is? 1922?

28:24.311 --> 28:25.529
Having a good time, fellas?

28:30.796 --> 28:32.014
What's it look like, pal?

28:33.799 --> 28:36.236
Can I ask you about a game
you played yesterday

28:36.279 --> 28:38.368
with my father, Marty Mantle?

28:38.412 --> 28:39.282
Yeah.

28:40.414 --> 28:41.502
How's he doing?

28:41.545 --> 28:43.156
To be honest,

28:43.199 --> 28:46.637
he's heartbroken
that our family business
is gone.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.117
I was wondering
if I could buy it back.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.381
Yeah, that may not work for us,

28:51.425 --> 28:53.862
as it's already gone up
in value.

28:53.906 --> 28:56.647
See, we're expanding
some of our operations,

28:56.691 --> 28:59.955
and we've been looking
for a business like
your dad's car lot.

28:59.999 --> 29:02.175
So if you were to
buy it off us,

29:02.218 --> 29:06.614
the price would now include
the projected income
for the next five years,

29:06.657 --> 29:09.138
not just the $100,000.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.314
What sort of operation
are you planning for?

29:12.663 --> 29:14.709
I don't think it'd be
your cup of tea.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.668
Are we talking a chop shop?

29:17.712 --> 29:22.456
Running contraband,
money laundering,
counterfeit play, what?

29:22.499 --> 29:24.850
- Get a load of this guy, will you?
- Please.

29:24.893 --> 29:28.244
I was boot licking him
when I was in high school.

29:28.288 --> 29:31.987
And you might want someone
to interface with the public.

29:32.031 --> 29:36.035
Someone trustworthy
and familiar with
how car lots work,

29:36.078 --> 29:40.169
to keep the trains running,
so no one gets suspicious.

29:40.213 --> 29:42.606
What I'm saying is,

29:42.650 --> 29:45.479
maybe we can help each other.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.054
Oh. Hi.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.752
Britta, right?
Can I see Cheryl?

29:57.796 --> 30:00.494
Uh, no. Um...

30:00.537 --> 30:03.671
Mistress Cheryl is getting
ready for something.

30:04.411 --> 30:05.499
For what?

30:05.542 --> 30:06.587
<i>A ritual.</i>

30:07.631 --> 30:08.589
I...

30:08.632 --> 30:10.460
I... I can't say.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.854
She made me promise,
and she knows...

30:14.813 --> 30:16.379
She knows when I'm lying.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.470
Okay. Listen to me.

30:20.514 --> 30:24.039
If you think it really loudly,
I might be able to hear it.

30:24.083 --> 30:24.997
You understand?

30:27.477 --> 30:29.523
<i>I'm living</i> <i>
a captive existence here.</i>

30:29.566 --> 30:32.004
<i>I'm sure you won't believe me,
but Mistress Cheryl is asleep,</i>

30:32.047 --> 30:34.354
<i>and her ancestor</i> <i>
Abigail Blossom</i> <i>
has possessed her body.</i>

30:34.397 --> 30:36.225
<i>and she's been trying</i> <i>
to kill people.</i>

30:36.269 --> 30:37.879
<i>Including you and your friends</i> <i>
on the eve of the blood moon,</i>

30:37.923 --> 30:40.099
<i>so Ms. Topaz's soul</i> <i>
will go into the corpse</i>

30:40.142 --> 30:42.710
<i>and Thomasina can be</i> <i>
reincarnated into</i> <i>
Ms. Topaz's empty body.</i>

30:44.016 --> 30:45.539
Are you going to be okay?

30:45.582 --> 30:46.627
Until the blood moon?

30:52.763 --> 30:54.896
I can't believe
Keller put us on patrol duty tonight

30:54.940 --> 30:56.898
When everyone else gets be
part of the turkey shoot.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.421
I want to see some action, man.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.336
Exterminate those Serpents
once and for all.

31:00.380 --> 31:01.642
Would you shut
your damn mouth, Walker?

31:03.252 --> 31:05.646
What are you talking about?

31:05.689 --> 31:07.474
What turkey shoot?

31:07.517 --> 31:08.605
With the Serpents?

31:10.999 --> 31:12.740
Kevin, whatever else
is happening,

31:12.783 --> 31:14.655
Toni is still
the mother of your child.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.136
Tell me.

31:17.179 --> 31:18.833
What is going on?

31:25.100 --> 31:27.059
Hey, Tabitha, what's up?

31:27.102 --> 31:28.364
The Ghoulies haven't
shown up yet.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.192
Do you have Baby Anthony?

31:30.236 --> 31:31.585
<i>No, and Toni,</i> <i>
you have to get out there.</i>

31:31.628 --> 31:33.195
<i>I think you walked into a trap.</i>

31:35.284 --> 31:37.591
What?

31:37.634 --> 31:39.071
<i>It's the Sheriff</i> <i>
and his deputies.</i> <i>
They're out for blood.</i>

31:39.114 --> 31:40.811
<i>Kevin told me it's going to be</i> <i>
a turkey shoot.</i>

31:40.855 --> 31:41.856
<i>Don't let it become one.</i>

31:42.813 --> 31:44.946
I'll call you right back.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.731
Everyone, we gotta go.
We gotta get out of here
right now.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.743
Hands in the air,
guns to the ground!

32:03.530 --> 32:05.358
Serpents,

32:05.401 --> 32:06.968
put your weapons on the ground
and put your hands in the air.

32:09.710 --> 32:10.972
Don't give them
a reason to shoot,

32:11.016 --> 32:12.669
that's exactly what they want.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.628
You heard her. The Serpents
are resisting arrest.

32:16.456 --> 32:18.110
The hell we are.

32:18.153 --> 32:21.940
And I'm live streaming this
right now, you scumbag!

32:21.983 --> 32:25.117
So be careful what you do,
because the whole world
is watching.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.823
Reggie.

32:35.866 --> 32:37.825
How are things going?

32:37.868 --> 32:42.134
I cleaned up my dad's mess
and I got the dealership back.

32:42.177 --> 32:45.659
Oh, and also you don't have to
worry about my dad
coming back.

32:45.702 --> 32:48.749
I told him he has a problem
and barred him
from the Babylonium.

32:50.751 --> 32:53.275
That's not
what I wanted, but...

32:54.668 --> 32:55.712
okay.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.977
Is he gonna get help?

32:59.978 --> 33:01.675
He's fine.

33:01.718 --> 33:02.893
That's all you need to know.

33:10.423 --> 33:11.467
Hey.

33:11.511 --> 33:12.860
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.557
Your mom
isn't here, right?

33:14.601 --> 33:16.168
No, she's at another one
of her secret Council meetings,

33:16.211 --> 33:17.865
Yeah, which we have to go.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.736
I actually think that
Cheryl needs our help more.

33:24.437 --> 33:25.307
Cousin?

33:26.352 --> 33:27.831
Why for this crying?

33:27.875 --> 33:29.659
Have you
heard about Archie?

33:30.965 --> 33:33.402
He's dead.

33:33.446 --> 33:36.623
He was burned alive
by a Ghoulie.

33:36.666 --> 33:37.667
Oh, dear.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.409
Can I come in?

33:40.453 --> 33:42.455
Of course.
Follow me into the parlor

33:42.498 --> 33:43.412
and I'll put on the kettle.

33:53.379 --> 33:56.556
Cheryl, if you can hear me,
help is on the way.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.096
Ms. Topaz,

34:16.141 --> 34:17.055
are you comfortable?

34:17.794 --> 34:19.883
I'm fine.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.885
Are you sorry your turkey shoot
didn't happen?

34:23.104 --> 34:24.453
I can't think what you mean.

34:25.585 --> 34:26.934
I've got good news for you.

34:26.977 --> 34:29.676
Your bail's been posted
by Tabitha Tate.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.807
You're being released.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.072
In the morning.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.988
I don't suppose
I can appeal to you

34:38.032 --> 34:40.469
as a mother who's looking
for her child.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.123
Oh, you mustn't worry
about Anthony.

34:43.777 --> 34:46.475
We raided a Ghoulie lair
earlier this evening

34:46.519 --> 34:48.564
and we found your son.

34:48.608 --> 34:52.046
Luckily, we got him out safely.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.918
Alas, the same can't be said
about the Ghoulies.

34:54.962 --> 34:57.356
It was an absolute bloodbath.

34:59.053 --> 35:01.490
Unfortunately, only
one of them survived.

35:01.534 --> 35:02.796
Twyla Twyst.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.972
She escaped.

35:05.015 --> 35:07.844
Like the roach that she is.

35:07.888 --> 35:09.542
And where the hell
is my son now?

35:10.369 --> 35:11.761
Safe and sound...

35:13.198 --> 35:14.286
with his father.

35:27.690 --> 35:30.867
You... Villains.

35:30.911 --> 35:33.827
You'll never get me
out of this body.
It's mine now.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.568
Mine!

35:35.611 --> 35:37.613
We'll see how long you last
once this fire gets going.

35:42.966 --> 35:45.621
You dare burn me again?

35:45.665 --> 35:47.754
As many times
as it takes, bitch.

36:00.201 --> 36:01.637
By the power of fire,

36:01.681 --> 36:03.944
the element of your
original destruction.

36:03.987 --> 36:06.338
- So too are you banished...
- I'll kill you all!

36:06.381 --> 36:08.166
...from this fleshy vessel.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.994
Spirit, we compel you.
Leave her.

36:15.651 --> 36:18.132
Friends,
as you've no doubt heard,

36:18.176 --> 36:22.484
Percival Pickens
has been nominated
for emergency election

36:22.528 --> 36:24.399
to the Town Council,

36:24.443 --> 36:26.358
filling the vacancy left

36:26.401 --> 36:29.404
by the currently incarcerated
Antoinette Topaz.

36:30.927 --> 36:32.625
All those in favor.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.846
And with that,

36:36.890 --> 36:39.240
a huge congratulations

36:39.284 --> 36:42.896
to the newest member
of the Riverdale Town Council,

36:42.939 --> 36:44.289
Percival Pickens.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.381
<i>You're all</i> <i>
gonna die for this!</i>

36:55.648 --> 36:56.692
Whoo!

36:58.303 --> 36:59.304
It twitched...

37:00.479 --> 37:02.045
in my hands.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.358
Mistress Cheryl?

37:12.099 --> 37:14.667
Cheryl, is that you?

37:16.930 --> 37:17.844
Yeah.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.021
But where's Abigail?

37:35.340 --> 37:37.342
- Oh!
- Oh, thank God.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.996
Oh, honey.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.129
I'm so, so sorry.

37:43.304 --> 37:45.524
He's... he's okay.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.700
Yeah, we got lucky this time.

37:47.743 --> 37:49.179
But now he is safe.

37:49.223 --> 37:51.269
And exactly where he should be.

37:53.836 --> 37:56.970
I should tell you, Toni,

37:57.013 --> 37:58.711
it's not easy for me
to say this,

37:58.754 --> 38:02.018
but I'm filing
for primary custody
of Baby Anthony.

38:02.062 --> 38:04.978
No, Kevin,
please don't do this.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.807
I've been talking
with Ms. Weiss.

38:07.850 --> 38:09.635
Given Fangs
and your recent behavior,

38:09.678 --> 38:11.245
it shouldn't be hard for me
to win guardianship.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.250
Kevin, why the hell
are you doing this?

38:16.294 --> 38:18.078
I don't understand.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.950
My only concern
is for Anthony's safety.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.359
How's it going, Dad?

38:38.403 --> 38:40.100
Oh, it's great.

38:40.143 --> 38:41.319
Everything's great.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.671
Glad to hear.
You look happy, Dad.

38:45.714 --> 38:48.848
Oh, yeah. Having the time
of my life, son.

38:48.891 --> 38:51.285
Time of my life.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.679
<i>It's not looking good,</i> <i>
I'm afraid.</i>

38:53.722 --> 38:56.116
Your father is
on the donor list,

38:56.159 --> 38:57.857
but at this point,
it is highly unlikely

38:57.900 --> 38:59.728
he'll get a transplant in time.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.731
Barring that,

39:02.775 --> 39:04.429
what do you think, Doc?

39:06.256 --> 39:07.649
He's looking at a year.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.522
Maybe two, if he's lucky,

39:17.877 --> 39:19.139
Is there anything I can do?

39:20.053 --> 39:21.271
Not at this point.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.231
Except maybe just make sure

39:24.274 --> 39:27.103
your dad enjoys
what little time he's got left.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.175
This is Agent Cooper.

39:55.218 --> 39:57.046
<i>Miss Cooper,</i> <i>
so sorry to bother you.</i>

39:57.090 --> 39:59.309
Have you heard
about the Ghoulies' slaughter?

40:00.441 --> 40:01.747
Yeah, I did.

40:01.790 --> 40:04.576
Twenty-two Ghoulies dead.
It's horrible.

40:04.619 --> 40:06.752
I'm sure you've got
your hands full.

40:06.795 --> 40:08.449
<i>I do.</i>

40:08.493 --> 40:10.103
<i>But there is something...</i>

40:10.146 --> 40:11.670
<i>off about the bodies.</i>

40:13.062 --> 40:14.716
Off in what way?

40:14.760 --> 40:16.805
According to
the Sheriff report,

40:16.849 --> 40:21.419
the Ghoulies were killed
in a gun fight with deputies
on the scene.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.943
<i>But I would say</i> <i>
the Ghoulies wounds</i>

40:23.986 --> 40:26.032
<i>were self-inflicted.</i>

40:26.075 --> 40:30.428
Hang on. They...
They shot themselves?

40:30.471 --> 40:33.213
Yes, I believe the Ghoulies

40:33.256 --> 40:36.129
turned their guns
on themselves.

40:45.225 --> 40:46.226
There.

40:46.922 --> 40:48.750
Sealed away.

40:49.359 --> 40:51.144
Forever.

40:51.187 --> 40:52.624
One more thing, Nana.

41:04.810 --> 41:08.509
It falls to us three women
to keep the eternal flames burning

41:08.553 --> 41:10.946
so that Abigail
will never escape

41:10.990 --> 41:12.818
or lay claim to my body again.

41:18.171 --> 41:20.521
Well, at least we saved Cheryl
from being possessed.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.262
So that's a win, right?

41:22.305 --> 41:23.872
Yeah. But while
we were doing that,

41:23.916 --> 41:26.440
Percival got himself
elected on the town council.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.181
The council that we formed.

41:28.224 --> 41:30.662
After killing 22 Ghoulies,

41:30.705 --> 41:33.229
and almost killing
the Serpents, maybe.

41:33.273 --> 41:36.058
So... what? He wants
to take over the town?

41:36.102 --> 41:39.584
Like Hiram Lodge?
We stopped Hiram.
We can stop Percival.

41:39.627 --> 41:43.588
I don't think Percival
wants to take over Riverdale.

41:43.631 --> 41:45.415
Something tells me
he wants to destroy it.
