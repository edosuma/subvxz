Thanks, Corey.

What's wrong?
You don't seem too excited.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.600
I'd be careful if I were you.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.233
Yeah, Brooke.
Tina's your understudy.

01:53.233 --> 01:55.200
She might poison you
so she can play the lead.

01:55.667 --> 01:59.167
She'd never do that. Throw me
down a flight of stairs, maybe.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.600
Real funny.
I wouldn't want the lead.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.767

This play is cursed.

[ Laughs ]

02:06.133 --> 02:08.067
- What are you talking about, Tina?
- I'm serious.

02:08.567 --> 02:10.067
My grandfather told me about it.

02:10.067 --> 02:12.067
He went to this school
72 years ago.

02:12.067 --> 02:15.100

Come on, Tina, tell us.

02:21.933 --> 02:25.433
It all started
the year the school was built.

02:25.933 --> 02:28.800
The drama club was putting on
the same play we are.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.300
The night of the play,

02:30.300 --> 02:33.000
the boy who was supposed to
play the Phantom disappeared.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.067
They searched everywhere.
His parents were freaking out.

02:37.067 --> 02:41.133
They called the police,
but they never found the body.

02:42.633 --> 02:45.000
A year later when they tried
to put on the play again...

02:45.467 --> 02:47.600

Can I borrow some lunch money?

03:08.800 --> 03:11.800
Oh, Phantom, you already owe me $10.
I hope you starve.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.900
What's all the noise?

03:15.767 --> 03:19.167
Zeke Mathews,
take off that mask, please.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.167
I was just getting into the character.

03:22.667 --> 03:26.200
There will be no more visits from
the Phantom, unless it's in the play.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.000
- I mean it.
- We shouldn't be doing this play, Ms. Walker.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.833
- My grandfather says--
- I don't want to hear that old story, Tina.

03:32.833 --> 03:34.833
The only haunting
we need to be concerned

03:34.833 --> 03:37.233
about right now is the one
that's in this play.

03:37.233 --> 03:40.600
Let's go through the show.
Corey, you are Carlo.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.800
- You are Esmeralda's father.
- Hi, Dad.

03:44.300 --> 03:47.200
You own a theater
and you think it's haunted. Zeke.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.633
I am the Phantom
who lives in the basement.

03:49.133 --> 03:51.133
Right.
And you are secretly in love

03:51.133 --> 03:53.233
with the theater
owner's daughter, Esmeralda.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.600
Do I have to be?

03:54.600 --> 03:56.367
Now, Esmeralda,
the Phantom kidnaps you.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.800
Then how come I stay in love with him?

03:59.267 --> 04:00.700
Because you're attracted
to his mystery.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.867
But your boyfriend finds out about it,
he kills him, and that breaks your heart.

04:05.300 --> 04:08.867
And the Phantom returns as a ghost,
haunting the theater forever.

04:08.867 --> 04:11.067
Which is what's gonna
happen if we do this play.

04:11.067 --> 04:13.467
- Tina.
- Uh, Ms. Walker.

04:13.467 --> 04:14.467
Not now, Corey.

04:14.467 --> 04:17.100
Maybe the Phantom will kidnap
Esmeralda again, huh, Brookie?

04:17.100 --> 04:19.533
Uh, Ms. Walker.

04:19.533 --> 04:22.400
- Uh, Ms-- Ms. Walker!

pressed the switch.

not been used in years

What's it doing here?

04:47.900 --> 04:50.100
The school had it built for the
first production of The Phantom.

- Let me try it.
- No! Not until I know it's entirely safe.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.733
I've never seen it before.

come all the way down here?

there's a big mess in the auditorium.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.167
- Can you help us clean it up?
- It's gotta wait till morning.

14:32.167 --> 14:34.100
Can't the night guy do it later?

14:34.100 --> 14:36.133
Night guy?
What night guy?

14:36.567 --> 14:37.967
Emile.
The night janitor.

14:37.967 --> 14:40.167
Night janitor?
There's no night janitor.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.333
[ Brian ]
I knew that weirdo wasn't a janitor.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.833
I don't know about this.
Maybe we should call the cops.

14:51.833 --> 14:52.833
No, we can't.

14:53.333 --> 14:56.333
If the cops come around here,
Ms. Walker will cancel the play for sure.

14:56.333 --> 14:57.833
You can't go, Brooke.
The note.

14:57.833 --> 14:59.833
The backdrop.
The Phantom wants Esmeralda.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.833
That's you.
Maybe your dream was a warning.

15:02.833 --> 15:05.533
If the situation was reversed,
would you go?

15:05.533 --> 15:08.400
I don't think
they'd let me play Esmeralda.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.833
I'm going.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.833
[ Trap Door Clanks ]

15:13.833 --> 15:15.333
Boo.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.700
He's down here, you guys.
I know it.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.700
- But what if he's a--
- If what?

15:38.200 --> 15:41.200
- What if Emile's a ghost?
- I don't believe in ghosts.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.200
- [ Elevator Motor Running ]
- It's going back up.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.200
- What do we do?
- Now what?

15:46.700 --> 15:48.700
We've got no choice.
Come on.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.100
[ Brooke ]
This place is too creepy.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.433
[ Brian ]
I don't like this.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.567
It's just too weird.

16:01.567 --> 16:05.067
- Nobody can live down here.
- It's disgusting.

16:05.067 --> 16:07.167
Look.
Something's there.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.167
Let's go.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.600
[ Zeke ]
Somebody lives here.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.900
Why didn't you listen to me?

16:38.900 --> 16:41.867
- The Phantom!
- I told you to stay away!

16:42.600 --> 16:45.133
- You should have listened to me.
- [ Zeke ] Run for it!

16:52.033 --> 16:54.833
- [ Brian ] Run! Hurry back!
- [ Zeke ] Run, Brooke, run!

16:56.200 --> 17:00.567
- Let go!
- You should have listened to me!

17:01.900 --> 17:03.933
- Emile!
- Come on!

17:03.933 --> 17:06.867
- [ Stomps ]
- [ Yells ]

17:08.967 --> 17:12.433
- [ Man ] Who's there?
- Mr. Levy?

17:24.433 --> 17:26.433
Thank you, Officer.

17:27.933 --> 17:31.933
Well, it looks like that
Emile character got away.

17:31.933 --> 17:35.433
But we found a hat and
this old mask down there.

17:35.933 --> 17:37.433
And the officer thinks that
he was a homeless man

17:37.433 --> 17:39.233
who was living underneath the stage.

17:39.233 --> 17:42.733
That's why he gave us those warnings--
to keep us from finding his home.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.233
You kids didn't use
the best judgment.

17:45.233 --> 17:46.733
If we didn't have a
staff meeting tonight,

17:46.733 --> 17:48.167
you might have been
stuck down there.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.200
We're sorry.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.833
Well, I'm sorry too, Zeke,
because I was wrong about you.

17:51.833 --> 17:54.633
- Does this mean Zeke's back in the play?
- I suppose it does.

17:54.633 --> 17:57.600
- The Phantom lives!
- Whoo!

17:57.600 --> 18:00.600
[ Organ ]

18:02.100 --> 18:04.633
[ Brooke ] Phantom!
Are you there, Phantom?

18:05.633 --> 18:07.933
Relax.
Don't be nervous.

18:07.933 --> 18:10.200
Phantom!
Are you there, Phantom?

18:11.200 --> 18:13.333
Okay, here we go.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.200
Please, Phantom, come to me.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.400
Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Hit the switch!

18:18.400 --> 18:20.400
Phantom?
Where are you?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.933
What's wrong with this--

18:22.433 --> 18:24.333
Phantom.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.700
Where are you?

18:26.700 --> 18:28.700
[ Motor Running ]

18:32.700 --> 18:35.700
[ Audience Applauding ]

18:38.700 --> 18:40.200
We are together at last.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.700
I've dreamt of this moment
for so long.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.700
So have I, Esmeralda.
So have I.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.733
Not so rough, Zeke.

18:49.367 --> 18:51.900
- [ Screams ]
- Fair Esmeralda.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.900
I have lived under this theater
for more than 70 years.

18:55.900 --> 18:59.300
I was to play the Phantom
on this very stage.

18:59.300 --> 19:03.167
It was to be the
greatest night of my life.

19:03.167 --> 19:05.067
But it was not to be.

19:05.067 --> 19:08.133
For one hour before
the curtain was to rise,

19:08.133 --> 19:11.400
I fell into the abyss,

19:11.400 --> 19:15.333
where I became a real phantom,

19:16.833 --> 19:21.400
hoping, waiting for this night,

19:21.400 --> 19:24.633
where I would finally
play my ultimate role!

19:26.133 --> 19:28.500
And you, Esmeralda,

19:28.500 --> 19:33.033
come with me to eternal darkness.

19:33.033 --> 19:34.867
Never!

19:34.867 --> 19:38.267
No! No!

[ Screaming ]

19:42.300 --> 19:45.400
[ Audience Applauding, Cheering ]

19:47.533 --> 19:51.033
Come on, everybody, on stage!
On stage, everyone!

19:51.533 --> 19:53.533
Brooke, that was marvelous!

19:54.033 --> 19:56.033
- Just marvelous!
- What about the scenery?

19:56.533 --> 20:00.067
Oh, and, Corey,
oh, weren't you sensational?

20:00.567 --> 20:03.267
- Where's Zeke?
- Oh, of course!

20:06.267 --> 20:09.267
I don't know where those lines came
from, mister, but they were brilliant.

20:09.767 --> 20:11.767
- [ Applause Continues ]
- [ Laughing ] Oh! Curtain call!

20:11.767 --> 20:13.267
Come on, everybody!
Curtain call!

20:13.267 --> 20:15.767
- Are you okay?
- Something hit me.

20:15.767 --> 20:16.767
[ Groans ]

20:17.267 --> 20:19.267
Where did this come from?

20:19.267 --> 20:21.367
I don't know.
What's going on here?

20:25.033 --> 20:27.033
Come on. Let's go.

Brooke? Brooke.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.800
Ready and--

Come on, everybody!
Your parents will want autographs!

20:47.500 --> 20:50.000
He was here, Zeke.
The Phantom-- He was here!

20:50.000 --> 20:51.500
What do you mean,
he was here?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
He got what he wanted-- to play
Phantom on stage after 72 years.

20:55.500 --> 20:58.000
Then he died all over again.
Tina was right.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.033
- Who died? What are you talking about?
- Look.

21:01.033 --> 21:03.533
"The Phantom to be
performed this spring."

21:04.033 --> 21:06.467
We know it never was until now.

21:06.467 --> 21:10.000
And there's the boy who was
supposed to play the Phantom in 1923.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
That's the boy who disappeared.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.500
[ Zeke ]
Oh, man. I don't believe it.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.000
It's Brian.
