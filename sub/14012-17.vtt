<i> In the criminal justice system</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:06.022
<i> the people are represented</i>

00:06.023 --> 00:08.007
<i> by two separate</i>

00:08.009 --> 00:09.775
<i> The police,</i>

00:09.777 --> 00:12.611
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:12.613 --> 00:15.014
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:17.218 --> 00:18.617
See you later, Louie.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.618
Yeah.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.086
Catch you
tomorrow.

00:21.088 --> 00:24.423
You don't even give a damn,
do you?

00:26.494 --> 00:28.027
Do you?

00:29.497 --> 00:32.064
What do you want me to do
about it, huh  Maggie?

00:32.066 --> 00:34.500
Like I got a lot of control
over your life.

00:34.502 --> 00:38.070
I'm not going back there.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.205
Where you going
to go, huh?

00:40.207 --> 00:41.573
Oh...

00:41.575 --> 00:44.109
thanks for the invitation.

00:44.111 --> 00:47.046
You just can't start flopping
all over the place.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.181
That's not
what I'm talking about.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.083
All right, look, let's get out
of here

00:51.085 --> 00:52.518
and we'll figure something out,
all right?

00:52.520 --> 00:56.488
Oh... so you can just dump me
on the street?

00:57.491 --> 00:59.091
Maggie...

00:59.093 --> 01:01.177
you just...

01:01.178 --> 01:03.262
Or maybe I'll just go away
and die, huh?

01:03.264 --> 01:04.329
Maggie!

01:05.566 --> 01:08.367
How about I do
everybody else a favor

01:08.369 --> 01:10.502
and blow it off right here!

01:10.504 --> 01:13.639
Or maybe I'll just
do everybody else!

01:13.641 --> 01:15.674
Maggie...

01:20.247 --> 01:22.581
Give me the gun.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.086
Why?

01:28.122 --> 01:30.222
Fine.

01:30.224 --> 01:33.659
Do whatever the hell you want.

01:33.661 --> 01:36.195
Now, don't you go!

01:36.197 --> 01:37.296
MAN:
Look out!

01:44.238 --> 01:47.372
Why did your girlfriend
try to kill you, Danny?

01:47.374 --> 01:49.174
She wasn't trying
to kill me, man.

01:49.176 --> 01:51.110
The gun just went off.
It was an accident.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.311
You were
arguing.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.179
Nine people saw
her shoot at you.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.447
She was drunk, man.
She didn't...

01:55.449 --> 01:58.584
Hey, her eyeballs are going
through the ceiling.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.651
That ain't drunk.

01:59.653 --> 02:00.652
Danny...

02:00.654 --> 02:02.187
unlicensed gun.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.890
Criminal possession three
or four.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.592
Felony or misdemeanor.

02:06.594 --> 02:09.128
Maybe she took
a little meth.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.529
What's
a little?

02:10.531 --> 02:11.530
I don't know.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.265
Five or six hits.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.267
Your treat?

02:15.269 --> 02:18.637
I don't know where
she could have got it.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.340
This better
be the truth.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.349
Boyfriend said
she did six hits of meth.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.751
Only I.D. we found.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.355
LOGAN:
Corson, Maggie.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.257
Issued at Haven House.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.592
Catholic drug rehab center.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.595
Maggie?

02:43.597 --> 02:44.696
Maggie?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.735
I've got nowhere to go.

02:53.674 --> 02:57.776
  Captioning sponsored by
  NBC/UNIVERSAL

04:13.020 --> 04:15.621
Look, this is ridiculous.
She's 16. She was stoned.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.357
If you want to arrest somebody,
arrest the creep she was with.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.592
That's already been done.
Now listen, as for Maggie

04:20.594 --> 04:23.629
accident or not,
she still has to be arraigned.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.365
And after that I can I take her
back to Haven House?

04:26.367 --> 04:27.666
That's up to
the judge.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.701
Oh, look, it was a relapse.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.737
It happens.
I mean, she is an addict.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.505
She's making
a difficult transition.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.674
No one is doubting you.
You're just telling

04:35.676 --> 04:38.010
the wrong people.
She's got to be arraigned.

04:38.012 --> 04:39.278
Great.

04:41.548 --> 04:42.948
Are you really a...?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.283
A nun?

04:44.285 --> 04:45.651
Yes, Detective, I am.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.720
So, I guess I would
call you "sister."

04:48.722 --> 04:50.722
Call me
whatever you want.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.174
Sister?

04:52.175 --> 04:53.625
Has somebody called
Maggie's parents?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.794
She ran away from home
three years ago.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.729
I doubt she's homesick.
Anyway, she's been

04:57.731 --> 04:59.665
in our custody for a year.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.768
She's our
responsibility.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.440
I thought nuns had curfews.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.710
That went out
with the penguin suit.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.445
Maggie, when you're arraigned

05:13.447 --> 05:15.814
you'll either be placed
in a juvenile ward

05:15.816 --> 05:17.683
or back at Haven House.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.686
Chances are, you'll get
a compassionate judge

05:20.688 --> 05:22.688
and you can go back
to the house.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.689
Maggie?

05:23.691 --> 05:26.325
Get her out of here!

05:26.327 --> 05:27.826
I don't want
her near me.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.094
Maggie...

05:29.096 --> 05:32.798
<i> Please</i> get her<i> out!</i>

05:35.703 --> 05:37.769
Let's go have a talk.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.377
Maggie,
what's the problem?

05:46.847 --> 05:49.848
It doesn't have to leave
this room.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.393
Maggie?

06:06.734 --> 06:10.669
Last night we were
in the shower.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.405
You and who?

06:14.608 --> 06:15.774
Sister Bettina.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.080
All right,
why were you in the shower?

06:25.853 --> 06:28.153
I was sick.

06:28.155 --> 06:31.690
She said I'd feel better
if I had a hot shower.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.660
Mm-hmm. Okay.

06:35.662 --> 06:38.096
And what happened then?

06:43.170 --> 06:46.171
She, uh...

06:46.173 --> 06:48.840
she had her hands on me.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.846
She put her hands
all over me.

07:01.789 --> 07:08.193
Okay, okay.
All right.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.762
CERRETA:
but she gave meeasy,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.197
the whole play-by-play--
the what, where how--

07:12.199 --> 07:13.799
everything Sister Bettina
did to her.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.667
You ask the nun about it?

07:15.669 --> 07:18.670
We didn't give her the
specifics, but as far as Maggie

07:18.672 --> 07:20.806
being flipped out, she says
she doesn't know why.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.941
You think this girl
was credible?

07:22.943 --> 07:25.811
She seemed really frightened
about going back.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.512
Hey, man, she's a meth head.

07:27.514 --> 07:28.947
You know, this could be a
fabrication.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.483
Could be she wanted
to be kicked out.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.818
But if she wants out,
there are better

07:32.820 --> 07:35.187
ways to go than a molest charge.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.555
She's young, she's speeding.
Who says she needs easy choices?

07:37.558 --> 07:38.790
Meaning?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.625
Come on, this is the first time

07:40.627 --> 07:43.762
we seen a false accusation
on a molest and a rape charge?

07:43.764 --> 07:45.931
But there's also
the other side, Mike.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.732
Where is the girl now?

07:47.734 --> 07:49.234
Manhattan Psychiatric.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.702
The D.A. dropped her down to

07:50.704 --> 07:52.471
criminal possession four
and a gun charge.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.606
Has she talked to anyone else
about the molest?

07:54.608 --> 07:56.775
Only her roommate.
We have a call in

07:56.777 --> 07:58.710
to the executive director of
Haven House.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.812
Let's see if we can't dodge

08:00.814 --> 08:03.648
the inevitable uproar
on this one, okay?

08:04.985 --> 08:08.720
MAN:
<i> the first I heard about this.</i>

08:08.722 --> 08:12.858
Maggie's roommate,
Maria Barragan,

08:12.860 --> 08:14.860
brought it to my attention.

08:14.862 --> 08:18.930
I sent for Maggie,
but she had already disappeared.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.633
Did you have a chance to speak
to Sister Bettina?

08:21.635 --> 08:24.169
This morning, after she got
back from the hospital.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.737
She's pretty stunned.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.739
What's your take on this?

08:27.741 --> 08:31.643
I wish I had one.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.879
Maggie Corson can be quite...

08:33.881 --> 08:36.748
Lacking
in the credibility department?

08:36.750 --> 08:39.885
Look, all of these kids
have been on the street.

08:39.887 --> 08:43.788
Survival became a lot
more important than honesty

08:43.790 --> 08:45.824
some time ago for most of them.

08:45.826 --> 08:49.761
So your first instinct on this
would be that Maggie's lying.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.764
If Maria hadn't seen them,
I would have to say

08:52.766 --> 08:55.967
it sounds incredible, given
Sister Bettina's reputation.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.903
Wait a minute.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.772
Maria is the roommate.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.909
She saw Sister Bettina
and Maggie together?

09:05.913 --> 09:08.947
She said she saw them
in the shower.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.919
I guess it was around 1:00.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.921
Maggie puked
all over herself.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.924
Sister B. showed up
and took her to the can.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.926
Mm-hmm.
Did you follow them?

09:20.928 --> 09:22.661
No, I just waited

09:22.663 --> 09:24.930
but, like, Maggie
wasn't coming back.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.065
I got worried,
so I went looking.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.935
I heard the water running
in the shower

09:29.937 --> 09:33.672
and I saw Sister B.
touching and kissing Maggie.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.341
Now, where, uh...?

09:36.343 --> 09:38.810
Where, exactly,
did she kiss her?

09:38.812 --> 09:41.680
On her face
and on her shoulder.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.815
Was Maggie dressed
or undressed?

09:43.817 --> 09:44.816
Undressed.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.351
And Sister Bettina?

09:46.353 --> 09:48.687
She had on
this blue bathrobe.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.821
Did you see
anything else?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.690
No. I went back
to my room

09:51.692 --> 09:53.091
and pretended
I was asleep

09:53.093 --> 09:55.360
and Maggie came back
by herself.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.761
She was crying.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.863
She said Sister B.
messed with her.

09:58.865 --> 10:01.066
What exactly did she say?

10:01.068 --> 10:05.704
She said Sister B.
put her fingers... you know.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.938
She was wigged out.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.708
She didn't want me
to tell anybody.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.076
But you told Mr. Powell.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.711
Sister B. is a freak.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.813
She shouldn't be
pulling that crap.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.615
All right, Maria,
let's get specific.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.882
You said you got worried

10:17.884 --> 10:20.785
when Sister Bettina took Maggie
to the bathroom.

10:20.787 --> 10:21.853
Why was that?

10:23.824 --> 10:26.324
She'd come on to me before.

10:26.326 --> 10:29.327
She put her hand
on my leg, you know,

10:29.329 --> 10:31.096
and she said she loved me.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.698
She was always saying
she loves me.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.870
That's what I mean--
she's a freak.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.946
Obviously, Maria's mixed up.

10:47.948 --> 10:51.383
She says she's pretty sure
of what she saw.

10:51.385 --> 10:54.019
Maria practically grew up
on Times Square.

10:54.021 --> 10:57.856
I mean there, somebody touches
you, it only means one thing.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.659
She's been with us
for only three months.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.895
She hasn't had time
to rearrange her thinking.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.866
This "hugs, not drugs"--
do you take that literally?

11:07.868 --> 11:10.402
I mean, do you have
any physical interaction

11:10.404 --> 11:11.770
with these girls?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.772
It's just a figure of speech.

11:13.774 --> 11:17.742
And you'd be surprised how far
the proper amount of affection

11:17.744 --> 11:19.411
will go with these kids.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.446
Maria nay have
her signals crossed,

11:21.448 --> 11:23.948
but that still leaves Maggie.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.117
That one I can't figure out.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.987
I always got along well
with Maggie.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.989
I don't know what happened.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.892
Maybe she's working
something out.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.094
Maybe she thinks I let her down.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.464
But you don't deny being in the
shower with her that night?

11:39.466 --> 11:40.799
She had stomach flu

11:40.801 --> 11:43.068
and she'd thrown up
all over herself.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.903
I helped her wash up.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.172
With a shower
at 1:00 in the morning?

11:47.174 --> 11:51.476
A sponge bath
would be less suspicious?

11:51.478 --> 11:53.912
LOGAN:
I may be wrong. I just
don't think she did it.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.881
You think clergy
can't trip over
their vows?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.150
It happens. I read the same
news reports you do.

11:59.152 --> 12:02.087
I just don't think
this is one of those cases.

12:02.089 --> 12:05.824
You got to admit, Phil,
it's not the usual profile.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.959
Just because it's
female on female
and it's rare

12:07.961 --> 12:09.961
doesn't mean
it doesn't happen.

12:09.963 --> 12:13.098
Yeah, I know--
anybody's capable of anything.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.833
That's rule number one.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.234
Look, I'm just saying this:

12:16.236 --> 12:18.970
If I was to take
odds on this...

12:18.972 --> 12:21.106
An ex-altar boy
wagering?

12:21.108 --> 12:22.407
I confess.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.510
We used to lift the wine
once in a while.

12:25.512 --> 12:29.914
Not us--
wafers, unblessed.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.855
OLIVET:
<i> Have you ever been afraid</i>

12:36.857 --> 12:38.123
of Sister Bettina?

12:38.125 --> 12:39.257
Afraid? No.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.127
Before the night
in the shower

12:42.129 --> 12:45.830
did you ever feel she
was interested in you
in a sexual way?

12:45.832 --> 12:47.532
No.

12:47.534 --> 12:51.102
I thought she was
just being nice to me.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.170
But...?

12:52.172 --> 12:54.906
I guess I didn't
pick up on it.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.108
I thought
she was different.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.877
Different than...?

12:58.879 --> 13:01.146
Everybody.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.848
Everybody who uses you.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.455
The night that Sister Bettina
touched you

13:10.457 --> 13:12.791
you were very sick,
weren't you?

13:12.793 --> 13:13.892
You had the flu?

13:13.894 --> 13:15.160
Mm-hmm.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.896
Did you have any bad dreams?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.015
Are you saying

13:20.016 --> 13:22.133
maybe I hallucinated
the whole thing?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.135
I know what she did to me.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.137
I know how she made me feel.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.908
And how is that?

13:29.910 --> 13:32.577
When things happen
to you on the street

13:32.579 --> 13:34.429
you expect it, you know?

13:34.430 --> 13:36.280
But if it happens to you
at Haven House...

13:36.283 --> 13:38.983
I was supposed
to be safe there.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.088
I really trusted her, you know?

13:46.026 --> 13:48.593
I know she did it.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.862
I know how it feels.

13:50.864 --> 13:54.032
Why? Has it happened
to you before?

14:04.144 --> 14:06.911
For three and a half years.

14:06.913 --> 14:10.615
Sometimes
twice a week.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.220
I was eight when it started.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.596
My mother never believed me.

14:24.598 --> 14:29.033
"No husband of mine
would ever do that," she said.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.002
"He loves you.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.240
He's your stepfather."

14:41.948 --> 14:44.015
OLIVET:
It's not about sex.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.984
It's about trust and betrayal.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.386
She was betrayed by her
stepfather, and then she was

14:48.388 --> 14:51.389
betrayed one step further by a
mother who refused to hear her.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.926
So Sister Bettina is what--
a kind of surrogate mother?

14:54.928 --> 14:57.328
Maggie was trying to rebuild.
Sister Bettina had become

14:57.330 --> 14:59.264
a figure
she was starting to trust.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.399
This thing blew apart
her whole world.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.402
You don't think her story
could have been rehearsed?

15:04.404 --> 15:07.005
I think this girl
was blindsided

15:07.007 --> 15:10.141
by someone she never even
perceived as a threat,

15:10.143 --> 15:12.677
either emotionally
or genderwise.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.013
There's a lot
of pain there.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.015
I don't think
it's an act.

15:17.017 --> 15:17.982
Great.

15:17.984 --> 15:20.418
So we move on a nun.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.353
I'll get a warrant.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.493
Does Sister Bettina

15:28.495 --> 15:32.130
have anything else in storage
in the building?

15:32.132 --> 15:34.365
Aside from
her office, no.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.267
I keep thinking

15:36.269 --> 15:39.270
I'll get struck by lightning
doing this.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.206
SISTER:
She should be
allowed to be here.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.309
I don't know why
she's being treated
like a criminal.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.711
I'm sure she understands these
men are just doing their job.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.179
Sister Bettina

15:48.181 --> 15:51.182
has always been
above reproach.

15:51.184 --> 15:54.452
What exactly are you guys
looking for?

15:54.454 --> 15:57.322
A lot of people
in molestation cases

15:57.324 --> 16:00.325
they keep diaries,
might have photographs

16:00.327 --> 16:01.292
you never know.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.527
Sometimes they save something

16:02.529 --> 16:05.129
from the encounter
as a sort of a souvenir.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.270
Phil.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.210
"M. Corson."

16:21.247 --> 16:22.447
Vomit?

16:22.449 --> 16:24.682
CERRETA:
She said she was
sick that night.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.520
Matching set.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.491
We showed Maggie these garments.
She identified them

16:33.493 --> 16:37.195
as the ones she was wearing
last Monday night.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.298
Sister Bettina may have kept
them as an encounter trophy.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.234
Or she simply intended
to get them washed.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.503
There's a laundry hamper
in the shower room.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.638
She could just as well
have left them there.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.241
Whatever you want to read into
it, it's subjective evidence.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.311
It's still a nun's word against
the say-so of two street kids.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.214
What, too bad they're not
seniors at Riverdale?

16:57.450 --> 17:00.518
Well, what about
this Sister Bettina?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.220
Anything there?

17:02.222 --> 17:05.323
She grew up in... Hollis.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.725
Joined a convent at age 20.

17:07.727 --> 17:11.262
She's been at Haven House
for eight years.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.798
Eight years
supervising teenage girls?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.434
If she does have a predilection

17:16.436 --> 17:18.736
this might not be
her first time.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.273
POWELL:
I never heard a complaint
about her.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.741
Never heard a rumor, either.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.244
You worked with her
for how long?

17:26.246 --> 17:27.762
I've been here six
years.

17:27.763 --> 17:29.279
Anybody ever complain
to the archdiocese?

17:29.282 --> 17:30.281
Had that happened

17:30.283 --> 17:32.216
I would have heard
about it.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.318
You're not the clergy.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.287
No, but 70% of our funds
come from the church.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.423
Wait a minute.
That should give them

17:38.425 --> 17:40.291
more incentive
to bury a thing like this.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.793
Not for Bettina.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.294
Why not?

17:43.296 --> 17:44.796
Sister Bettina aligns herself

17:44.798 --> 17:47.799
with what the church calls
non-traditional nuns--

17:47.801 --> 17:50.268
outfits like the women's
ordination movement

17:50.270 --> 17:52.537
women as priests, birth control.

17:52.539 --> 17:56.374
If the church had a reason
to get rid of her

17:56.376 --> 17:57.575
I'm sure they would have.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.577
How about on the outside?

17:59.579 --> 18:02.246
You know anything
about her private life?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.384
No, I have no idea.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.253
You ever meet
any of her friends?

18:09.255 --> 18:12.390
Well, at fund-raisers.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.392
There was a woman--

18:14.394 --> 18:17.395
um... Anne Houston.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.730
She worked at the Queens
Family Shelter.

18:19.732 --> 18:23.401
I think they still talk,
like, every other day.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.504
You ever read
<i> Catcher in the Rye?</i>

18:26.506 --> 18:28.773
Save the children--
that's Tina.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.409
Have you ever
heard any gossip

18:31.411 --> 18:32.777
or complaints about her?

18:32.779 --> 18:35.279
You mean, why would
a normal woman

18:35.281 --> 18:37.482
choose to live
in a community of nuns?

18:37.484 --> 18:39.450
We've talked about her vows,

18:39.452 --> 18:41.285
we've talked about sex.

18:41.287 --> 18:45.456
Tina always said she redirects
her energy into her work.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.458
Did she get along
with the kids?

18:47.460 --> 18:50.728
Did you ever see
any misunderstandings?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.430
Maybe an incident
of some kind?

18:52.432 --> 18:53.865
Look, she ran day care
for three years.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.333
Everybody loved her.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.868
You want testimonials?

18:56.870 --> 18:59.337
There will be a line
around this block.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.873
Everybody knows
these charges are crap.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.092
Why did she leave?

19:04.093 --> 19:06.310
She was on loan from the
church, and they found out

19:06.312 --> 19:08.646
the shelter was providing
birth control counseling

19:08.648 --> 19:10.414
so they yanked her.

19:10.416 --> 19:13.584
Do you have any idea why this
girl would accuse her?

19:13.586 --> 19:15.853
What difference does it make?

19:15.855 --> 19:18.322
She's been accused, labeled.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.325
How is she going to shake that?

19:21.327 --> 19:22.527
Olivet's report

19:22.529 --> 19:24.662
the clothes,
the eyewitness--

19:24.664 --> 19:27.532
most of it seems
to support Maggie's story.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.500
Except for the fact
that Sister Bettina

19:29.502 --> 19:33.604
practically walks on water
according to<i> all</i> her friends.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.608
I'm waiting for ideas.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.413
We've got to get off the dime
one way or the other.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.548
The archdiocese
wants it dropped.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.516
They both seem to be telling
the truth.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.319
Fellas, there are
no tie breakers.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.354
If we're not sure she did it,
we kick her.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.690
ROBINETTE:
Sister Bettina offered
to take a polygraph.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.825
It's not admissible, but at
least we'll know

19:54.827 --> 19:56.694
if we're
on the right track.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.666
MAN:
Are you 34 years old?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.734
BETTINA:
Yes.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.572
Is your father's name Michael?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.440
Yes.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.976
Were you
in Maggie Corson's room

20:11.978 --> 20:13.978
the night of February 9?

20:13.980 --> 20:16.581
Yes.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.983
Did she have
a stomach flu?

20:18.985 --> 20:21.586
Yes.

20:21.588 --> 20:25.590
Did you sexually molest
Maggie Corson on that night?

20:25.592 --> 20:26.791
No.

20:26.793 --> 20:31.462
Did you kiss Maggie Corson
on that night?

20:31.464 --> 20:33.464
No.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.967
Did you tell the police
the truth

20:35.969 --> 20:39.470
about the events
on the night of February 9?

20:39.472 --> 20:40.504
Yes.

20:40.506 --> 20:43.841
Are you telling the truth now?

20:43.843 --> 20:45.576
Yes.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.651
She passed on direct questions
about the molestation

20:53.653 --> 20:57.388
but her answers on the details
registered as false--

20:57.390 --> 21:01.492
questions like whether or not
the girl had stomach flu.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.027
She could have been nervous.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.496
She also failed the question

21:05.498 --> 21:08.499
of whether or not
she was telling the truth.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.501
On the whole, the results
classify as deceptive.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.037
Or inconclusive,
depending on your mind-set.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.439
Either way,
she's hiding something.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.807
Reason enough to charge her.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.776
Polygraph tests are
inadmissible. You gonna sell

21:18.778 --> 21:21.012
this to the grand jury
and then not use it?

21:21.014 --> 21:24.415
We have a victim's complaint,
eyewitness, opportunity.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.051
I don't foresee a problem.
I would like to see

21:27.053 --> 21:29.053
that she has a chance to
surrender.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.554
We'll call her.

21:30.556 --> 21:32.523
I want her R.O.R.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.793
Are we sure we want to be
perceived as giving her
preferential treatment?

21:35.795 --> 21:39.797
To all intents and purposes,
Sister Bettina is indigent.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.733
You see her as a flight risk?
I don't.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.946
Um... this is my lawyer,
Francine Hughes.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.882
From the archdiocese?

21:57.884 --> 21:59.817
No, she's just
an old friend.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.652
May I see the warrant?

22:03.489 --> 22:07.658
My client declines
to answer any questions.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.493
Fine.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.029
It's a beautiful morning,
isn't it?

22:12.031 --> 22:14.632
Yeah.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.775
Francine explained the results
of the lie detector test.

22:24.777 --> 22:29.980
I'm sure she also told you
that polygraph results are
nonadmissible as evidence.

22:29.982 --> 22:33.084
Yes, and if it were up to me,
I wouldn't be here today,

22:33.086 --> 22:35.419
but Francine
insisted

22:35.421 --> 22:37.588
that I tell you what happened.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.891
That night, Monday,
Maggie didn't have the flu.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.244
She was drunk.

22:43.245 --> 22:45.596
When I found her, she
could hardly stand up.
She was covered in vomit.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.499
I helped her wash up,
and then put her to bed.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.901
Then I hid her clothes
in my room.

22:50.903 --> 22:54.572
I didn't want anyone to know
she'd been drinking.

22:54.574 --> 22:58.509
That's not the first time
she was drunk at the house.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.611
She'd been caught
twice before.

23:00.613 --> 23:04.815
She came to us by a special
dispensation of the court.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.551
A third report of drinking
and they'd pull her out.

23:07.553 --> 23:11.489
You'd protect her
even at the risk
of going to jail?

23:11.491 --> 23:13.424
If Maggie
were thrown out,
she'd be lost.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.826
Sooner or later, she'd end up
back on the streets.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.529
Do you have any idea what
her life expectancy would be?

23:18.531 --> 23:20.931
Do you know
how many street kids die

23:20.933 --> 23:22.533
from AIDS or drugs?

23:22.535 --> 23:24.569
How many are beaten,
raped?

23:24.570 --> 23:26.604
We can't take it on faith
that Maggie was drunk.
We need corroboration.

23:26.606 --> 23:30.007
My client is ready
to take another polygraph.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.877
We need more than that.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.413
She's lying.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.482
I can't believe
you're buying into it.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.687
We ran tests on the clothes
you threw up on.

23:43.689 --> 23:46.490
We know how much
you drank that night.

23:49.429 --> 23:51.162
Now listen to me.

23:52.098 --> 23:55.933
You lie in court,
that's perjury.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.703
So I was drunk.

23:59.705 --> 24:00.971
Big deal.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.673
She still messed with me.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.975
You had a lot
to drink, Maggie.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.445
How much do you
really remember?

24:07.447 --> 24:12.616
I know she took me
into the shower.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.718
I<i> know</i> that.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.088
What else are you sure of?

24:23.963 --> 24:26.697
I don't know.

24:26.699 --> 24:30.167
I... was in the shower...

24:35.675 --> 24:37.608
I can't remember.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.944
What do you mean
you can't remember?

24:43.983 --> 24:46.984
I guess I passed out.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.154
What you told the police--
did you make that up?

24:50.156 --> 24:52.256
It happened.

24:52.258 --> 24:55.693
Maria saw it

24:55.695 --> 24:57.261
and she told me.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.263
She told me everything.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.532
She saw it.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.205
Maybe it was the morning after
when she told me

25:08.207 --> 25:10.174
what Sister B. did to her.
But she blacked out.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.242
She doesn't remember
what happened.

25:11.244 --> 25:12.643
You told police

25:12.645 --> 25:14.745
that Maggie described
in graphic detail

25:14.747 --> 25:16.280
what Sister Bettina did.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.616
I saw them in the shower, okay?

25:18.618 --> 25:20.184
I saw what was going on.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.586
But you lied.
Maggie didn't tell you anything.

25:22.588 --> 25:25.055
And now ita's only your word
that anything happened at all.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.223
Isn't that right?

25:27.693 --> 25:30.995
Maria, are you happy
at Haven House?

25:30.997 --> 25:32.062
Do you want

25:32.064 --> 25:34.064
to go back on the street?

25:34.066 --> 25:38.002
Then I don't understand
why you would make up
a story like this.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.570
What do you mean?

25:39.572 --> 25:43.140
If they believe this story--

25:43.142 --> 25:46.777
if people think girls are
being molested at Haven House

25:46.779 --> 25:49.713
what do you think that does
to the reputation of the house?

25:49.715 --> 25:52.249
But it was only Sister B.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.618
In the public mind,
they're the same.

25:54.620 --> 25:55.719
They'll withdraw their support.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.022
Without funds,
Haven House closes,

25:58.024 --> 26:00.157
and where do you think
you'll be?

26:00.159 --> 26:02.693
That's not true.
You're just trying to scare me.

26:02.695 --> 26:05.663
Maria, did you see

26:05.665 --> 26:09.133
Sister Bettina
molest Maggie?

26:14.840 --> 26:18.075
I don't want to hurt
anybody else.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.210
I just wanted them
to get rid of her.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.780
Why? What did she do to you?

26:22.782 --> 26:26.083
She knew.
She asked me about it.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.085
He'd think I told.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.254
Told what?

26:33.159 --> 26:35.593
Mr. Powell.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.795
Me and him.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.771
Powell initiated
the relationship

26:47.773 --> 26:49.773
one month after Maria
arrived at Haven House.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.810
He put her in a position
where she would do his errands

26:52.812 --> 26:55.145
and get excused
from the scrub work.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.114
She still could have said no.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.783
He said he'd put her on the
street if she didn't go along.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.720
Sister Bettina uncovered this?

27:02.722 --> 27:05.055
She had no idea.
She asked her about the errands.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.124
She was concerned the other
girls might get envious.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.727
It was a perfectly innocent
question, but Maria thought

27:09.729 --> 27:13.631
the worst-- that her secret was
out and she'd be the one to go.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.866
So when she saw
Sister Bettina in the
shower with the girl

27:15.868 --> 27:17.701
she jumped at the chance to
discredit her.

27:17.703 --> 27:19.770
Any way to corroborate
her story?

27:19.772 --> 27:21.805
I talked to Powell's secretary.
She confirmed that

27:21.807 --> 27:25.309
Maria spent a lot of time alone
with Powell in his office.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.711
Did you file
a motion to dismiss?

27:27.713 --> 27:29.279
Yes, on the way over,
but I think

27:29.281 --> 27:30.681
we ought to go after Powell.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.217
For what? Rape?

27:33.218 --> 27:35.752
She said that Powell
didn't physically force her

27:35.755 --> 27:37.688
to have relations
with him.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.790
The girl was 17 at the time.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.259
You got no statutory charge.

27:42.261 --> 27:45.729
He's in a position of authority
over teenage girls.

27:45.731 --> 27:46.864
He's abusing it.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.365
A civil case, maybe.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.834
Criminal court?
I don't see it.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.102
Suppose it's not the first
incident?

27:52.104 --> 27:53.888
He's been on the job
six years.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.673
You think it's the first time
he's succumbed to temptation?

27:55.675 --> 27:58.876
I'd sure like to know the answer
to that question

27:58.878 --> 28:01.178
before we make up
our minds.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.880
Go.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.849
This whole thing sucks.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.886
I can't believe she
would do that to me.

28:08.888 --> 28:12.356
You didn't know she was
involved with Powell?

28:12.358 --> 28:13.824
No.

28:13.826 --> 28:16.460
If he hit on her,
she could have told me.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.363
He ever try anything with you?

28:19.365 --> 28:21.365
Maybe when I first got there.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.933
He'd come into your room

28:22.935 --> 28:26.336
at the wrong time...

28:26.338 --> 28:28.372
call you into his office,

28:28.374 --> 28:30.340
ask you stupid questions.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.876
But I just stayed away from him.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.712
A lot of girls fall for it?

28:34.714 --> 28:37.815
Everyone thought
he was pretty much of a joke.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.253
Except this
one girl.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.822
What about her?

28:44.824 --> 28:47.191
I don't know
for sure

28:47.193 --> 28:51.195
but I heard talk
about her and Powell.

28:51.197 --> 28:55.733
We have the cancelled checks
he sent you, Ms. Morrill.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.968
He's not giving you
that money

28:57.970 --> 29:00.437
out of the goodness
of his heart.

29:00.439 --> 29:04.174
What...? Do I have
to give the money back?

29:04.176 --> 29:05.909
As far as we can tell

29:05.911 --> 29:09.480
it legitimately belonged
to Jack Powell.

29:09.482 --> 29:13.016
If he gave it to you,
it's yours to keep.

29:13.018 --> 29:18.422
When I was at the house,
we had this thing going.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.757
A sexual relationship?

29:19.759 --> 29:22.025
Couple of times a week.
That's all.

29:22.027 --> 29:24.428
How old were you?

29:24.430 --> 29:25.963
15 when it started.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.965
What was in it for you?

29:27.967 --> 29:30.868
I didn't have to work
in the kitchen.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.770
He'd have me do errands

29:32.772 --> 29:34.872
let me go to the movies...

29:34.874 --> 29:36.874
Seems hardly worth it now.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.543
Did he ever threaten
to hurt you if you didn't
go along with it?

29:39.545 --> 29:47.017
He said if I told anyone,
I'd have to leave the house.

29:47.019 --> 29:52.923
At the time,
I didn't have anywhere to go.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.926
How long has it been
since you left?

29:55.928 --> 29:57.427
Three years ago.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.797
Since then, Powell's been
giving you $200 a month

29:59.799 --> 30:01.932
for what, just to
keep your mouth shut?

30:12.478 --> 30:15.546
He would have preferred
I lose it.

30:18.083 --> 30:21.485
Ms. Morrill, would you
be willing to repeat

30:21.487 --> 30:24.488
what you just told me
to the grand jury?

30:24.490 --> 30:26.890
You mean, go to court?

30:28.360 --> 30:32.095
Look, nobody knows about this--

30:32.097 --> 30:34.364
nobody...

30:34.366 --> 30:37.601
and I'm not going
to change that.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.442
ROBINETTE:
She was 15.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.945
Statute of limitations
hasn't run out.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.880
We could force her
to testify

30:49.882 --> 30:52.516
but her husband
thinks the kid is his.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.618
That leaves
only Maria Barragan.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.954
With a possible charge
of rape one.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.356
Rape one? But Powell never
threatened Maria.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.325
With no forcible
compulsion...

31:01.327 --> 31:03.293
An adult male
with the power

31:03.295 --> 31:05.529
to send a girl
back to the streets

31:05.531 --> 31:07.865
demands that she
have sex with him.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.933
That's not forcible
compulsion?

31:09.935 --> 31:12.903
There's no physical threat, no
threat death or physical injury.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.938
I'm willing
to take the chance
to make the case.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.374
Get me a slot
in the grand jury.

31:17.376 --> 31:20.377
We're going for an
indictment for rape
in the first degree.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.880
ATTORNEY:
You're way off base
on this, Ben.

31:22.882 --> 31:25.549
Jack Powell has spent
his entire life

31:25.551 --> 31:27.885
working selflessly
for the public good.

31:27.887 --> 31:30.888
He's raised hundreds
of thousands of dollars

31:30.890 --> 31:32.890
for charities.
For crying out loud!

31:32.892 --> 31:34.892
Did he tell his contributors
about the afternoons

31:34.894 --> 31:36.026
he spent with Maria Barragan?

31:36.028 --> 31:38.896
It was an indiscretion,
not a crime.

31:38.898 --> 31:41.164
Maria's 17. She's an adult.
She consented.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.567
We're not charging you
with statutory rape, Mr. Powell.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.569
We're charging you
with rape in the first degree.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.142
I didn't force her.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.944
I didn't have to.

31:53.946 --> 31:55.445
She said
you threatened

31:55.447 --> 31:57.514
to expel her from Haven House.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.617
Twice, for curfew and drugs.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.586
Then you do admit you threatened
to expel her?

32:02.588 --> 32:04.421
Yes, with good reason.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.440
Legitimate reason in whose mind?

32:06.441 --> 32:08.458
Look, Ben, didn't the episode
with Sister Bettina

32:08.460 --> 32:09.359
tell you anything?

32:09.361 --> 32:10.694
Maria Barragan's a liar.

32:10.696 --> 32:13.630
She'll say anything
to get what she wants.

32:13.632 --> 32:16.133
And what she wants
is to stay alive

32:16.135 --> 32:18.969
and in her mind, that means
staying at Haven House.

32:18.971 --> 32:21.138
A lie like this
does not serve
her best interests.

32:21.140 --> 32:24.474
Maybe we can work something out.

32:24.476 --> 32:28.478
Sexual abuse three, pleads nolo,
one year community service.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.614
A "b" misdemeanor?
This is more than

32:30.616 --> 32:32.683
a traffic violation.

32:32.685 --> 32:35.686
Without proof
of forcible compulsion

32:35.688 --> 32:37.154
you have no case.

32:38.958 --> 32:39.990
Motion to dismiss.

32:39.992 --> 32:42.526
See you tomorrow, 2:30

32:42.528 --> 32:45.662
Judge Reisman's chambers.

32:50.035 --> 32:53.470
ATTORNEY:
<i> Maria Barragan</i>

32:53.472 --> 32:55.706
was blowing kisses
for nickel bags

32:55.708 --> 32:58.141
long before she ever heard
of Jack Powell.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.644
Which is hardly relevant.
It sure as hell affects
her credibility.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.113
That's a matter for the jury.
Not for me.

33:03.115 --> 33:06.516
Even if you look at the facts
in a light most favorable

33:06.518 --> 33:08.685
to the prosecution
the indictment has still failed

33:08.687 --> 33:12.122
to make a<i> prima facie</i> case
for rape one.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.524
The statute is
clear-- it requires

33:14.526 --> 33:16.693
threat of death
or physical injury.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.629
Your Honor, we intend to prove
in court that it was reasonable,

33:19.631 --> 33:21.531
under those circumstances,

33:21.533 --> 33:23.500
for Maria Barragan to fear for
her life.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.735
She wasn't seduced.

33:24.737 --> 33:26.136
She submitted.

33:26.138 --> 33:28.505
She consented, for God's sake.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.007
My instinct tells me

33:30.009 --> 33:32.109
you're asking me
to stretch the law

33:32.111 --> 33:34.011
to places it shouldn't go.

33:34.013 --> 33:35.712
However, I'm going

33:35.714 --> 33:37.681
to reserve my decision

33:37.683 --> 33:40.751
on defendant's motion
to dismiss until

33:40.753 --> 33:42.652
after trial.
Your Honor...

33:42.654 --> 33:44.654
Charge stays for now.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.190
We go to trial right away.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.362
Reisman reserved decision.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.231
It's a minor miracle.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.599
So we're halfway there.

33:55.601 --> 33:58.068
We present a compelling case...

33:58.070 --> 34:00.103
Don't fool yourself.
Reisman's no ground-breaker.

34:00.105 --> 34:02.172
Read his decisions.

34:02.173 --> 34:04.240
If there's no precedent,
it doesn't fly in his court.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.309
So why didn't he dismiss?

34:06.311 --> 34:07.344
Who knows?
Could be waiting

34:07.346 --> 34:09.112
for the jury to acquit.

34:09.114 --> 34:11.515
Then he doesn't have
to make a decision.

34:11.517 --> 34:14.117
Could be he's ready
to make new law.

34:14.119 --> 34:15.519
I wouldn't bet on it.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.320
You talked to McCarter?

34:17.322 --> 34:19.322
He wants a slap on the wrist.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.291
Well, maybe you ought to start
slapping.

34:21.292 --> 34:23.259
What do you suppose a trial like
this is gonna cost the state?

34:23.262 --> 34:25.395
Even if you
convince a jury

34:25.397 --> 34:28.432
Reisman snaps his fingers,
sets aside the verdict.

34:28.434 --> 34:32.402
Adam, since when does cost
have anything to do with it?

34:32.404 --> 34:36.339
Since the state
is on the verge of bankruptcy.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.509
It's a no-win, my boy.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.511
Reisman goes your way

34:41.513 --> 34:44.147
we got the appeal
to worry about.

34:44.149 --> 34:46.550
A trial of any sort puts Haven
House out of business.

34:46.552 --> 34:49.286
Adam, he raped
a 17-year-old girl.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.287
Did he?

34:50.289 --> 34:52.289
Statute says physical harm.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.558
It doesn't say
put her in a situation

34:54.560 --> 34:56.293
where she could get hurt.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.261
But it's all in the victim's
state of mind.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.297
Maria's fears were real.
If he had threatened

35:00.299 --> 35:03.300
to throw her out
on the expressway...

35:03.302 --> 35:05.402
He didn't threaten anything.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.436
She's a kid, Adam.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.571
To her

35:07.573 --> 35:10.407
Times Square is
just as dangerous.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.309
The law doesn't
read that way.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.643
Maybe it should.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.181
BARRAGAN:
<i> When I was 12</i>

35:18.183 --> 35:19.449
my mother ran away.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.351
STONE:
And your father?

35:21.353 --> 35:22.652
I never knew him.

35:22.654 --> 35:25.388
A complete bio, Your Honor,
is hardly relevant.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.491
It's relevant
to the victim's state of mind.

35:27.493 --> 35:30.360
It's the<i> defendant's</i>
state of mind that's at issue.

35:30.362 --> 35:33.363
The defendant took advantage
of the victim's fear.

35:33.365 --> 35:36.433
I think it's necessary to show
the derivation of that fear.

35:36.435 --> 35:38.268
I'll allow it.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.504
STONE:
After you were abandoned,
where did you live?

35:40.506 --> 35:42.139
In Port Authority

35:42.141 --> 35:44.341
until Sister Bettina
found me.

35:44.343 --> 35:47.377
Did you prefer Haven House
to the streets?

35:47.379 --> 35:49.346
They didn't beat me,
or anything.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.348
The sisters--
they cared about me.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.383
And Mr. Powell?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.920
He liked me fine.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.488
McCARTER:
Your Honor, we've
established already

35:58.490 --> 36:01.224
that the defendant
and this witness

36:01.226 --> 36:02.626
had sexual relations.

36:02.628 --> 36:05.428
We don't need a play-by-play,
Mr. Stone.

36:05.430 --> 36:09.366
Maria, please describe
for the court

36:09.368 --> 36:11.301
the circumstances

36:11.303 --> 36:14.504
leading up to your
first sexual encounter

36:14.506 --> 36:15.672
with Mr. Powell.

36:15.674 --> 36:19.509
I was in his office.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.379
He started
touching me.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.781
He said
he could make me feel good

36:24.783 --> 36:27.384
and he could make my life easy.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.319
I told him I wasn't interested.

36:29.321 --> 36:31.254
But you<i> did</i> sleep with him.

36:31.256 --> 36:34.724
He said he would have me thrown
out of the house if I didn't.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.359
You believed him?

36:36.361 --> 36:38.228
He showed me a form.

36:44.369 --> 36:47.370
Please describe the paper
I just handed you.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.373
It's the form they use when they
throw you out of Haven House.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.409
Was that the form
Mr. Powell handed you?

36:52.411 --> 36:55.412
No, the one he showed me
had my name on it.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.613
So you willingly

36:56.615 --> 36:58.381
slept with him?

36:58.383 --> 37:01.284
I was scared.

37:01.286 --> 37:01.985
Of the streets?

37:01.987 --> 37:03.320
I've been there.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.689
It's better than going back.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.290
Anything is.

37:07.292 --> 37:10.393
That's why I lied
about Sister Bettina.

37:10.395 --> 37:13.530
I thought if anyone found out...

37:14.800 --> 37:16.666
Thank you.

37:16.668 --> 37:19.236
REISMAN:
Your witness.

37:26.445 --> 37:29.312
Have you ever been arrested,
Miss Barragan?

37:29.314 --> 37:30.347
Objection.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.382
If we're giving bios

37:32.384 --> 37:34.451
let's give
the unabridged version.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.019
Overruled.

37:36.021 --> 37:39.322
Miss Barragan?

37:39.324 --> 37:41.324
Three times.

37:41.326 --> 37:42.692
What were the charges?

37:42.694 --> 37:44.694
Prostitution.

37:44.696 --> 37:47.464
So you were a whore?

37:47.466 --> 37:48.632
Your Honor!

37:48.634 --> 37:51.334
All right.
Enough of that,
Mr. McCarter.

37:54.473 --> 37:57.440
The Haven House
isn't all fun and games.

37:57.442 --> 38:00.343
You have to earn your keep.

38:00.345 --> 38:04.381
There's cooking,
washing clothes, cleaning.

38:04.383 --> 38:05.782
Isn't that right?

38:05.784 --> 38:08.418
It's part of the rehab.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.421
Isn't it true, Miss Barragan,
that when you first started
working for Mr. Powell

38:11.423 --> 38:14.391
most of your chores
were eliminated?

38:14.393 --> 38:15.625
Yes.

38:15.627 --> 38:19.296
What kind of work
did you do for Mr. Powell?

38:19.298 --> 38:22.666
I filed papers,
answered phones.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.869
Hell of a lot easier
than scrubbing toilets.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.404
Your Honor...

38:27.406 --> 38:28.838
Uh, withdrawn.

38:28.840 --> 38:33.310
When you were out on the street,
Miss Barragan,

38:33.312 --> 38:36.913
you sold your body for money,
isn't that true?

38:36.915 --> 38:38.782
I had to eat.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.417
Oh, I understand.

38:40.419 --> 38:43.420
You were trying
to make your life easier.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.422
That's what a whore does.
Your Honor...

38:45.424 --> 38:48.358
Weren't you trying to do that
with Mr. Powell--

38:48.360 --> 38:49.793
trying to make your life easier?

38:49.795 --> 38:50.794
Objection!

38:50.796 --> 38:52.329
Miss Barragan?

38:52.331 --> 38:53.663
REISMAN:
Sustained.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.399
That's enough,
Mr. McCarter.

38:56.401 --> 38:58.702
POWELL:
I've worked for non-profits
all my life.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.870
I don't know, maybe
there are some people

39:00.872 --> 39:03.540
who think I'm too caring.
If I minded my own business

39:03.542 --> 39:05.742
I wouldn't leave myself
open to...

39:05.744 --> 39:07.444
all kinds of problems.

39:07.446 --> 39:10.347
When did you first come in
contact with Miss Barragan?

39:10.349 --> 39:11.881
She was a new girl.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.451
There's a routine
first interview.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.486
I liked her attitude.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.488
She was very bright, eager.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.690
I needed someone to run errands.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.426
It began
as a non-sexual relationship.

39:23.428 --> 39:24.961
Yes.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.831
But then she began
to put out signals

39:27.833 --> 39:30.433
as if she were interested
in me.

39:30.435 --> 39:33.470
What kind of signals?

39:33.472 --> 39:35.155
I don't know.

39:35.156 --> 39:36.839
Like... the way
she'd look at me.

39:36.842 --> 39:40.443
MCCARTER:
To what did you
attribute her interest?

39:40.445 --> 39:42.579
POWELL:
I'm not really sure.

39:42.581 --> 39:48.451
Certainly not because I have
some magnetic effect on women.

39:48.453 --> 39:50.887
Maybe it was because
I was nice to her,

39:50.889 --> 39:53.456
or maybe she thought

39:53.458 --> 39:55.725
she could get something
out of me.

39:55.727 --> 39:59.963
What did you do
about these advances?

39:59.965 --> 40:01.564
I put her off,

40:01.566 --> 40:04.434
but she was
very persistent.

40:04.436 --> 40:07.804
I'm not proud I slept with her.

40:07.806 --> 40:10.440
Maybe this was bound to happen.

40:10.442 --> 40:13.676
I spend a lot of time
with these girls, and...

40:13.678 --> 40:17.747
in a way, they're trained
to deal with men sexually--

40:17.749 --> 40:20.417
to use sex to get
what they want.

40:20.419 --> 40:23.553
It was stupid of me to give in
to that.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.722
Did you ever
threaten Maria?

40:25.724 --> 40:29.492
Overtly
or implicitly?

40:29.494 --> 40:30.427
No, never.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.629
She'd been victimized enough.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.431
Did you intimidate her?

40:34.433 --> 40:36.800
That's what I don't understand.

40:36.802 --> 40:40.003
I'm probably the only guy
she was ever with

40:40.005 --> 40:42.739
who actually cared for her.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.808
I felt I was
very kind with her.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.643
I can't understand

40:46.645 --> 40:49.212
why Maria would say
she was afraid of me.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.481
No further questions.

40:52.551 --> 40:56.486
Mr. Powell, do you recognize
the name Marjorie White?

40:56.488 --> 40:57.921
She was with us for a while.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.657
We caught her dealing
to the other girls.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.892
Did you throw her
out of the house?

41:02.894 --> 41:05.562
She was dealing drugs.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.629
All right.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.764
Alberta Gaines?

41:07.766 --> 41:10.967
She was expelled for violence.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.937
STONE:
Rosa Valdez,
was she expelled?

41:13.939 --> 41:15.905
Yes.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.842
Do you know what happens
to these girls

41:18.844 --> 41:20.477
that are expelled?

41:20.479 --> 41:23.079
Sister Bettina tries
to keep track of them.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.615
Do you know what happened
to Rosa Valdez?

41:26.585 --> 41:28.751
I believe she died of AIDS.

41:28.753 --> 41:30.086
Alberta Gaines?

41:30.088 --> 41:31.488
Um... an overdose.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.823
Marjorie White died, too?

41:33.825 --> 41:34.824
Yes.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.559
Raped and stabbed 12 times

41:36.561 --> 41:38.695
by six members of a gang.

41:38.697 --> 41:42.098
Of all 18 girls expelled
in the past six years

41:42.100 --> 41:44.968
three have died of AIDS,
five of drug overdose

41:44.970 --> 41:46.703
one of exposure,
two murdered

41:46.705 --> 41:48.505
and the rest
just disappeared.

41:48.507 --> 41:49.572
Isn't that true?

41:49.574 --> 41:50.707
Yes.

41:50.709 --> 41:53.643
So, isn't it reasonable

41:53.645 --> 41:56.913
under these circumstances
for Maria Barragan

41:56.915 --> 41:59.849
to fear for her life when you
threw her out on the street?

41:59.851 --> 42:00.984
Objection.

42:00.986 --> 42:03.253
Sustained.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.521
Did she ever say she was afraid
of leaving Haven House?

42:05.524 --> 42:08.558
I ne... Listen, when these girls
have been on the street

42:08.560 --> 42:09.792
long enough they become
hardened, tough.

42:09.794 --> 42:11.127
They're not afraid of anything.

42:11.129 --> 42:13.563
So if you're beaten up enough,
you lose your fear?

42:13.565 --> 42:14.864
You learn how to survive.

42:14.866 --> 42:17.667
Until someone kills you.

42:28.613 --> 42:33.149
STONE:
The law says that if Jack Powell
never placed Maria Barragan

42:33.151 --> 42:36.719
in fear of death
or physical injury

42:36.721 --> 42:42.625
he cannot be convicted
of rape in the first degree.

42:42.627 --> 42:44.894
He didn't wrestle her
to the ground.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.163
He didn't put a gun to her head.

42:47.165 --> 42:48.164
He simply said:

42:48.166 --> 42:50.333
Have sex with me

42:50.335 --> 42:53.903
or I'm throwing you
back out on the street.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.573
Case dismissed?

42:59.177 --> 43:01.010
Maybe.

43:01.012 --> 43:08.084
But what did that threat
mean to Maria?

43:08.086 --> 43:10.653
Another broken arm?

43:10.655 --> 43:14.624
AIDS instead of hepatitis?

43:14.626 --> 43:17.760
A bullet
instead of a razor blade?

43:17.762 --> 43:19.062
More rapes?

43:19.064 --> 43:20.163
More beatings?

43:20.165 --> 43:22.599
And more than anyone,

43:22.601 --> 43:25.202
Jack Powell knew

43:25.203 --> 43:27.804
that his threat contained
the weight of all those things.

43:27.806 --> 43:31.641
When he threatened to remove her
from the one safe harbor

43:31.643 --> 43:33.142
in her sad, young life

43:33.144 --> 43:37.914
he put her in fear for her life
and her physical well-being.

43:37.916 --> 43:40.917
And he didn't put a gun
to her head.

43:40.919 --> 43:44.621
No, he showed her another way
he could hurt her.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.963
WOMAN:
<i> Were you expecting</i>
<i> a guilty verdict this quickly?</i>

43:53.965 --> 43:56.666
I can't anticipate
the mind of a jury,

43:56.668 --> 43:58.167
but I'm very grateful.

43:58.169 --> 44:00.403
MAN:
What about the mind
of Judge Reisman?

44:00.405 --> 44:02.672
Do you think
he'll dismiss It?

44:02.674 --> 44:05.208
I think we met
the burden of proof.

44:05.210 --> 44:07.677
If he dismisses,
do you have a plan
how to proceed?

44:07.679 --> 44:09.412
Yes, we do.
Mr. Stone.
Mr. Stone!

44:09.414 --> 44:11.714
Okay, you convinced a jury

44:11.716 --> 44:13.883
but it doesn't
mean a thing

44:13.885 --> 44:17.153
till Reisman rules
on the motion to dismiss.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.956
With his history,
I wouldn't hold my breath.

44:19.958 --> 44:21.858
Our knowledge of rape and power
has grown.

44:21.860 --> 44:23.760
The law should reflect that.

44:23.761 --> 44:25.661
Right now you got leverage.
Use it or lose it.

44:25.664 --> 44:28.865
Now, I say call McCarter,
work out sentence.

44:28.867 --> 44:31.801
You think my case was that weak?

44:31.803 --> 44:33.736
No, I just think that the
judiciary

44:33.738 --> 44:35.805
isn't as open-minded as you.

44:35.807 --> 44:37.140
(<i> phone buzzes</i> )

44:39.944 --> 44:41.678
Robinette.

44:43.214 --> 44:44.213
Hold on.

44:44.215 --> 44:46.215
McCarter's looking for you.

44:46.217 --> 44:48.284
He wants to talk
about sentencing.

44:48.286 --> 44:51.054
You can still lose it.

44:51.056 --> 44:53.823
No deal.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.727
(<i> sighs</i> )

45:00.832 --> 45:02.231
Be seated.

45:05.303 --> 45:07.770
After listening to the evidence
and reading Counsel's briefs

45:07.772 --> 45:10.973
I find that the prosecution
has met its burden

45:10.975 --> 45:15.178
with respect to the charge
of rape in the first degree.

45:15.180 --> 45:19.315
Defense motion to dismiss
denied.

45:19.317 --> 45:22.285
The jury verdict
of guilty stays.

45:22.287 --> 45:24.721
(<i> gavel pounds</i> )

45:26.257 --> 45:29.225
Get out your sound bite, Ben.

45:29.227 --> 45:31.194
Yeah, nothing sells
like sex.

45:31.196 --> 45:33.296
Don't sell yourself short.

45:33.298 --> 45:35.231
Everybody loves a winner.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.217
Yeah.

45:37.218 --> 45:39.202
There will probably
be a reversal on appeal.

45:39.204 --> 45:41.204
Probably. But maybe
the legislature

45:41.206 --> 45:44.507
takes a look,
rewrites the law.
