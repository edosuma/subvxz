10:08.874 --> 10:11.477
- That's right.
That's right.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.380
Follow me.
Follow me.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.248
- Take him out.

10:16.315 --> 10:17.717
- Heading your way, boys.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.485
You've got one shot.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.187
- Oh, yeah.

10:22.488 --> 10:24.724
- Come on.
Come on.

10:25.424 --> 10:26.959
- [yells]

10:27.026 --> 10:28.127
- Got him.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.829
- Now we--

10:29.895 --> 10:31.097
oh, no.

10:32.932 --> 10:36.769
{\an8}- And boom goes the dynamite.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.210
- [hisses]

10:44.276 --> 10:47.480
[audience cheers]

10:47.546 --> 10:50.216
<i>- The tank wins!</i>
<i>The tank wins!</i>

10:50.282 --> 10:52.485
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

10:52.551 --> 10:54.987
- Yes, we did it!
- Whoo-hoo!

10:56.889 --> 10:57.923
- Hm?

11:01.527 --> 11:02.561
Mm.

11:02.628 --> 11:03.796
- [yelps]

11:03.863 --> 11:04.897
[chokes]

11:07.199 --> 11:08.234
- Hm.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.635
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.270
- [exhales]

11:11.337 --> 11:14.240
My boys.
I am so proud.

11:14.306 --> 11:15.608
- Did you just hear that?

11:17.777 --> 11:19.512
- Yes.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.747
all: Whoa.

11:21.814 --> 11:24.150
{\an3}- Okay, rock-paper-scissors
for the first slice.

11:24.216 --> 11:25.484
Me and Mikey are up.

11:25.551 --> 11:27.219
{\an3}- It's funny how Raph
always starts

11:27.286 --> 11:29.588
{\an3}against
Mr. "Only Chooses Scissors."

11:29.655 --> 11:31.991
{\an8}Both: One, two, three...

11:32.058 --> 11:32.992
{\an8}- Scissors.
- Rock.

11:33.059 --> 11:35.094
{\an8}- Oh, not again.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.362
{\an8}How do you do it?

11:36.429 --> 11:37.830
{\an8}- [laughs]

11:37.897 --> 11:38.931
{\an8}Huh?

11:41.200 --> 11:44.670
{\an8}Pizza slice gone.
Which of you creepoids took it?

11:44.737 --> 11:46.205
{\an8}- [laughs]
all: Huh?

11:46.272 --> 11:49.208
{\an8}[all screaming]
- The table's eating our pizza!

11:49.275 --> 11:51.310
{\an8}[chewing]

11:51.377 --> 11:52.478
{\an8}- It's the chair!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.747
{\an8}[all grunt]

11:54.814 --> 11:55.948
{\an8}- Wait, pops?

11:56.015 --> 11:57.616
{\an8}- Mm. yes.

11:57.683 --> 12:00.052
{\an8}And so begins your next lesson.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.387
- Let me guess.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.222
How to starve your enemies
to death?

12:03.289 --> 12:05.825
{\an3}- No.
Today, you learn the art

12:05.891 --> 12:08.894
of ninja stealth
and invisibility,

12:08.961 --> 12:12.098
{\an3}the foundation
of every great ninja.

12:12.164 --> 12:13.099
Lights-off-jutsu.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.433
- What?
Ugh.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.302
You couldn't have done this
last week

12:16.368 --> 12:18.771
when Mikey cooked
Brussels sprouts?

12:18.838 --> 12:21.640
- You must remain sleek
and nimble,

12:21.707 --> 12:23.642
so no weapons today.

12:23.709 --> 12:26.545
After my lessons,
you will be ready for a mission

12:26.612 --> 12:29.348
inside Big Mama's Yokai Hotel.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.083
- You know about Big Mama?

12:31.150 --> 12:33.319
- I have heard stories.

12:33.385 --> 12:37.423
Ninja invisibility lesson
number one.

12:42.394 --> 12:43.896
{\an8}- Use your enemy's blind spots

12:43.963 --> 12:46.799
{\an8}to advance across
the battlefield.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.902
Be as light as a feather...

12:49.969 --> 12:52.004
as quick as a really
fast feather.

12:52.071 --> 12:54.406
Move quickly and softly.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.848
- Please, like you could
possibly sneak up on--

13:02.915 --> 13:05.684
hey, give me back my Tech-Bo...

13:06.652 --> 13:08.387
And wallet.
- [laughs]

13:08.454 --> 13:13.125
Now, using your new skills,
sneak up on me and attack.

13:13.192 --> 13:14.460
- Here I come.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.395
- Ninja tip.
Do not announce attack.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.730
- Roger that.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.366
Watch me stick
to the shadows, baby.

13:20.432 --> 13:23.102
Lights-off-jutsu.

13:23.169 --> 13:24.303
- Really?

13:24.370 --> 13:26.572
You think you can
turn off the sun?

13:26.639 --> 13:27.873
No more fooling around.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.042
- I'll show you fooling around.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.845
"Light as a feather"-jutsu
active.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.847
[grunts]

13:34.914 --> 13:37.983
[all yelling]

13:39.985 --> 13:41.420
Uh-oh.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.157
[all moaning]

13:45.891 --> 13:47.026
Ugh.

13:47.092 --> 13:50.362
- Boys,
you are not kindergarteners.

13:50.429 --> 13:52.598
Focus.
Lesson five.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.367
Blending into your environment.

13:55.434 --> 13:56.602
[grunts]

13:56.669 --> 13:58.437
{\an3}- What?
Where'd he go?

13:58.504 --> 13:59.605
- We'll never find him.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.507
- Yeah, he's way too smart

14:01.574 --> 14:04.009
for all of us teenage turtles,

14:04.076 --> 14:05.411
Right, my dudes?

14:05.477 --> 14:07.346
- Tiniest brother is right.

14:07.413 --> 14:08.581
He could be that pigeon,

14:08.647 --> 14:10.082
or that moped,

14:10.149 --> 14:12.218
or that trash pile.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.286
all: Yeah!

14:14.353 --> 14:16.055
- Well done, my sons.

14:16.121 --> 14:18.224
You just
beat up a big pile of garbage.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.725
[all groaning]

14:19.792 --> 14:21.927
It was me all along.

14:21.994 --> 14:22.995
all: Whoa.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.663
- Amazing.
- What a disguise.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.165
- Tricked by the master.
- But you're not a turtle.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.067
Oh, wow.
- [sighs]

14:28.133 --> 14:32.204
Maybe the only way
to get through to you is fear.

14:32.271 --> 14:35.474
I am sending you rodeo clowns
on a mission right now.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.109
You must sneak into Big Mama's

14:37.176 --> 14:39.645
and grab the tags
off her demon dog Gus.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.348
If that vicious beast
cannot get you to focus,

14:42.414 --> 14:43.415
then nothing will.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.417
Now go!
- Yeah!

14:45.484 --> 14:48.787
[all muttering]

14:50.956 --> 14:54.026
- Ah, they will do very well.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.162
Maybe they stopped for sundaes.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.597
Oh, that's it.

14:58.664 --> 15:00.532
A little fear never anyone.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.001
[grunts]

15:02.067 --> 15:04.670
A giant demon dog
never hurt anyone, either.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.173
I have sent my sons
to their doom!

15:08.240 --> 15:10.142
Don't worry, boys.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.244
Help is on the way.

15:21.186 --> 15:22.221
[grunts]

15:23.255 --> 15:24.290
[laughs]

15:26.025 --> 15:28.661
- High alert.
Chip-chop, lads.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.629
Everyone to their stations.

15:30.696 --> 15:31.864
- High alert?

15:31.930 --> 15:34.033
My boys.
They have been discovered.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.469
- Hey, you.
Hold the elevator.

15:37.536 --> 15:39.405
- Faster, stupid elevator.
Faster.

15:39.471 --> 15:42.808
- Let's go, let's go.
High alert, high alert.

15:48.981 --> 15:52.284
- Let's go, let's go.
High alert, high alert.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.385
- Oh.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.321
I have failed my sons.

15:55.387 --> 15:59.024
I do not deserve
my "Greatest Dad" coffee mug.

15:59.992 --> 16:03.495
- Okay, we made it
to an elevator.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.164
{\an1}- [gasps]
They are not all caught.

16:05.230 --> 16:08.100
I am as pleased
as I am totally shocked.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.235
- Is that Gus?
Grab his tags.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.971
- I cannot because
it is the bellboy.

16:13.038 --> 16:15.541
{\an1}- They are still trying
to get the dog tags.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.343
{\an3}- We gotta get
to another floor,

16:17.409 --> 16:20.679
{\an3}and I know just how to do it.
Lesson number four.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.148
Slow...

16:23.215 --> 16:25.451
motion...

16:25.517 --> 16:28.320
jutsu.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.860
[laughs]
- [groans]

16:37.262 --> 16:38.397
No.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.698
Gus.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.167
He's even more ferocious
than I remember.

16:42.234 --> 16:45.304
May my sons proceed
with caution just this--

16:45.371 --> 16:47.005
what?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.174
{\an3}- Whoa.

16:49.241 --> 16:50.409
{\an1}- [growls]

16:50.476 --> 16:52.077
[sniffs]

16:52.144 --> 16:55.013
Something doesn't smell right.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.249
- Oh, no.
He sniffed them out.

16:57.316 --> 16:58.817
[grunts]

17:02.721 --> 17:04.390
- What?

17:06.959 --> 17:09.027
Thanks for the snack,
food cart.

17:09.094 --> 17:12.064
You're no longer
on my to-pounce-on list.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.602
- We blended.

17:16.667 --> 17:20.038
- I must make sure
the others are safe.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.340
- High alert!
Everyone to your stations.

17:22.407 --> 17:23.809
Go, go, go!

17:23.876 --> 17:26.444
Big Mama must be massaged
and manicured A.S.A.P.

17:26.512 --> 17:27.846
- Yes.

17:32.584 --> 17:33.519
- [grumbles]

17:33.585 --> 17:35.254
[gasps]
Raphael.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.588
Remember your training.

17:36.655 --> 17:38.323
Stick to the shadows.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.893
- Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom.

17:42.027 --> 17:43.228
- Ah.

17:43.295 --> 17:44.630
[laughs]

17:44.696 --> 17:48.133
That is not what I meant
by sticking to the shadows.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.474
[sniffs]

17:55.541 --> 17:57.176
What is that awful smell?

17:57.242 --> 18:01.947
- Oh, no, Raph's
"sneaking up on people" stink.

18:02.681 --> 18:04.917
- [growls]

18:06.118 --> 18:07.553
- Ahh.

18:07.619 --> 18:09.855
- Oh, sweet.
A ball.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.825
- [grunts]

18:13.926 --> 18:15.961
- Wait, who threw this ball?

18:16.028 --> 18:17.396
[growls]

18:17.463 --> 18:20.365
It's like I'm being followed,
but no one's there.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.402
Total bummer day.

18:25.003 --> 18:27.739
- Now to find blue one.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.277
Too many Yokai.

18:32.344 --> 18:36.114
Surely my sons would not
risk moving on Gus in here.

18:36.181 --> 18:38.851
[gasps]

18:38.917 --> 18:41.019
- Blind spot.

18:41.086 --> 18:43.722
And a blind spot over here.
And blind spot over here.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.157
Another blind spot.

Hm?

19:41.313 --> 19:42.881

19:42.948 --> 19:45.150
- You can't hide from me.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.254

19:49.321 --> 19:52.291

"hey, how you been sesh," or--
