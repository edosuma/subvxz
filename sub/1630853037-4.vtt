OFFICER:
All right, ma'am,
walk this way.

00:09.884 --> 00:12.262
We're taking you in
for booking.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.808
(door slides shut)

00:16.850 --> 00:18.685
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Eyes to me, please.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.647
JAILER:
You're up.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.066
JUDGE:
Battery. Released on
your own recognizance.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.651

00:26.693 --> 00:29.279
BAILIFF:
You got someone you can call?

00:29.320 --> 00:31.406
(brakes creaking)

00:33.283 --> 00:34.909
(bus door opens)

00:36.327 --> 00:38.288
Thanks for picking me up.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.123
Of course.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.042
You ready to go home?

00:42.083 --> 00:44.544
Come on.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.965
(ticking)

00:58.892 --> 01:00.268
Why won't you stop?

01:00.310 --> 01:01.978
(sighs)

01:02.020 --> 01:04.189
Come on.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.199
(exhales)

01:14.240 --> 01:16.117
Damn it.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.994
(door creaks open)

01:18.995 --> 01:20.914
Maggie, I'm sorry,
I think I

01:20.955 --> 01:23.124
incinerated...

01:25.168 --> 01:27.170
(sighs) What's wrong?

01:31.132 --> 01:33.051
I screwed up.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.513

worry, cry.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.456
No need for action,

02:03.498 --> 02:05.959
just stand by.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.794

02:07.836 --> 02:10.046
when they die.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.173
♪ ♪

02:14.425 --> 02:16.594
I can't believe
she didn't call me first.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.513
No offense.
None-none taken.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.598
Or Harry, or Jordan.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.643
Look, I don't... want to get
involved in couple stuff, but

02:23.685 --> 02:26.437
she made it sound like her and
Jordan had some kind of fight.

02:26.479 --> 02:27.605
And, um,

02:27.647 --> 02:28.982
Harry... (exhales)

02:29.023 --> 02:30.233
I don't know
what's going on with him,

02:30.275 --> 02:32.152
but I think he's burned out.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.571
He told me last night
he was gonna go live a little,

02:34.612 --> 02:35.905
whatever that means.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.408
Great time for a midlife crisis.
(chuckles)

02:38.449 --> 02:41.744
Did Maggie say anything
about the arrest?

02:41.786 --> 02:42.871
No.

02:42.912 --> 02:46.332
And... I didn't want
to push her.

02:46.374 --> 02:49.002
I had no idea
she was this out of control.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.295
I should've known.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.504
No.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.882
(sighs) I know
I can fix this

02:53.923 --> 02:55.967
if I can just get
Maggie to open up.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.552
I think Maggie
just needs time.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.262
No, we don't have time.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.306
Not with the Tallyman out there
planning God knows what.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.976
I just wish I could
take her away.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.187
Okay, well, what if you could?

03:07.228 --> 03:09.105
I know I'm not an expert witch,
but I did

03:09.147 --> 03:11.608
survive being swallowed
by a Snake Lady yesterday,

03:11.649 --> 03:14.569
so I'm sure I can hold down
the fort for a few hours.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.115
(chimes)

03:19.157 --> 03:20.533
GemCast.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.202
I picked one up
at the Blue Camellia.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.536
It's mostly just crowdsourced

03:23.578 --> 03:25.163
complaints for
the magical world,

03:25.205 --> 03:26.831
like, "Kyons are getting
into my trash,"

03:26.873 --> 03:29.083
but it's a good way to keep
tabs on the non-witch

03:29.125 --> 03:31.502
and demon action
out there.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.755
Next is the witchboard...
Oh, yeah, right. (chuckles)

03:33.796 --> 03:35.715
How do I use that thing?

03:35.757 --> 03:37.675
All you need to know is that
if you see a red light,

03:37.717 --> 03:39.969
that's bad, and you call me.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.222
Okay. I've got you
on favorites.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.308
No cell reception
where I'm taking Maggie, so...

03:48.311 --> 03:50.897
...you need to call me on this.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.651
Call you on this?
Blow into it.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.402
All right.

03:56.444 --> 03:59.530
(tone sounds)

03:59.572 --> 04:01.157
I hear this,
and I will

04:01.199 --> 04:03.409
get back to you
in less than a minute.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.622
Is this all too much?
No. I used to be

04:07.664 --> 04:09.916
a temp night watchperson
back in high school, so

04:09.958 --> 04:11.251
I know how to sit on my ass

04:11.292 --> 04:12.585
and stare at some screens
for a few hours.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.337
Go. Get out of here.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.047
Okay.
(chuckles)

04:16.089 --> 04:18.549
Wait, uh, where exactly
are you going?

04:21.636 --> 04:22.887
MAGGIE:
What the hell is Ripples?

04:22.929 --> 04:25.014
Ripples is
the number one

04:25.056 --> 04:27.350
magical spa
in the Midwest.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.227
Josefina tried
to get us to go there,

04:29.269 --> 04:30.979
remember?
Mel, I...

04:31.020 --> 04:32.981
I'm really tired.
Maybe another time.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.816
Well, listen to this,

04:34.857 --> 04:37.902
"Powered by an ancient,
crystalline spring

04:37.944 --> 04:40.113

04:40.154 --> 04:42.240
Sounds like a bath,
which we have here.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.325
I just...

04:44.367 --> 04:46.411
I really want to be alone, okay?

04:46.452 --> 04:48.079
What you want
and what you need

04:48.121 --> 04:50.415
are two
different things.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.333
You've been through
a lot, Maggie.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.169
You need this.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.755
I need this.
We need this.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.091
Okay, fine, I'll go,

05:00.133 --> 05:01.759
on one condition.

05:02.969 --> 05:06.389
Please don't interrogate me
about last night.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.100
Okay.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.852
Okay.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.270
This is gonna be great
for all of us.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.063
You and I are gonna get
a little R&R,

05:14.105 --> 05:16.065
and Kaela is going
to get an easy

Welcome to Ripples,

05:57.023 --> 05:59.108
the spa at Merrow's Spring.

06:05.865 --> 06:06.949
I think he's a merman.

Please don't pander to me, Mel.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.870
Hey, Arnold?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.163
You have a reservation?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.624
Yes, for Mel
and Maggie.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.709
Vera.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.504
Vera! The Charmed Ones.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.547
Yeah.
Yeah, I put that in the book,

06:21.589 --> 06:23.257
and I thought
it might be a joke.

06:23.299 --> 06:24.801
You wouldn't believe
how many reservations we get

Robert!

06:29.389 --> 06:31.140
Rob!
(bell rings)

06:31.182 --> 06:32.558
Thank you, Robert.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.810
Uh, please take
the Charmed Ones' bags

06:33.851 --> 06:35.728

Sorry about Robert. He's new.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.826
And this is our lounge

06:49.867 --> 06:52.245
and gift shop
with unique items

06:52.286 --> 06:54.122
you will not find
anywhere else.

All bath bombs

06:56.249 --> 06:58.835
Hm.
Well, maybe
tomorrow as well.

06:58.876 --> 07:02.046
And as you can see, our majestic
water lily has just bloomed.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.340
I think
it's an omen that

07:04.382 --> 07:06.759
you are about to have
the most soothing day.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.345
We'll start with
the Phoenix Facial.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.763
Then the Kraken Callous Nibble--

07:10.805 --> 07:11.889
don't worry,
they're just babies,

07:11.931 --> 07:13.182
don't have their
adult teeth yet.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.103
And then, my favorite,
the scalp massage.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.273
Do you have a treatment
for sore muscles?

07:20.314 --> 07:23.818
From, like...
fighting too much?

07:23.860 --> 07:25.903
Unbelievable.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.906
We've been here ten seconds, and
you're already fishing for info.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.867
We agreed, Mel.
That is not

07:30.908 --> 07:33.411
what I meant, Maggie.
No, no, no. Uh...

07:33.453 --> 07:35.913
We eschew tension
here at Ripples,

07:35.955 --> 07:37.415
so, for you two,
the, uh,

07:37.457 --> 07:41.210
the Premium Treatment
will be gratis.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.546
Can we just try to have fun?

07:43.588 --> 07:45.339
I don't know, can we?

07:46.632 --> 07:49.886
No talking,
no questions, just...

07:49.927 --> 07:52.889
Kraken nibbles, okay?
Deal.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.558

Oh, no, no.

Everything has to be perfect

09:00.414 --> 09:03.459
for the Charmed Ones,
so when you are finished here,

09:03.501 --> 09:05.920
I want you to polish
the lily pads.
Of course.

Hey, this isn't funny.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.842

09:57.096 --> 09:59.473
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.143
Donnie, I'm gonna
break down the door!

10:02.184 --> 10:03.686

breathe.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.578
You good?
Mm-hmm.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.705
This is so great.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.458
After everything,
you know?

10:31.505 --> 10:33.924
It was really hard

10:33.966 --> 10:36.761
to talk to Ruby. Hard, but good.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.931
I-I have so much work
to do on myself.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.434
But, I mean,
we all do, right?

10:43.476 --> 10:45.227
We're not supposed to talk
with the masks on.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.854
Right, but I was
wondering, since

10:46.896 --> 10:49.357
you're the expert,
if there was a healthier way

10:49.398 --> 10:51.233
for me to redirect my anger.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.194
Respect the mask, Mel.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.278
Sure, but...
And also

10:54.320 --> 10:56.155
respect my intelligence.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.324
We're talking about me,
we're not talking about you.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.785
We had a deal.
No, I wasn't...

11:00.826 --> 11:02.328
Mask.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.500
But...
Shh!

11:07.541 --> 11:09.752
KAELA:
Hey, Mel,

11:09.794 --> 11:12.463
so there's been
a slight issue, um...

11:12.505 --> 11:15.132
One of my doodles came to life,
and then there was a ruckus,

11:15.174 --> 11:17.468
and then your lights went red
for a second,

11:17.510 --> 11:19.303
and I'm pretty sure
no one is in danger,

11:19.345 --> 11:20.930
but now... the conch

11:20.971 --> 11:23.015
is... (sighs)

11:23.057 --> 11:24.809
The conch is in pieces,

11:24.850 --> 11:28.479
and I just, I just need
to make sure you're okay, so...

11:28.521 --> 11:29.939
(sighs) What's the point?

11:29.980 --> 11:32.191
You're not gonna get
this message anyway.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.402
(sighs)

11:34.443 --> 11:36.570
Hey, don't worry, I'm...

11:36.612 --> 11:39.115
I'm gonna fix this, okay?
I promise.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.326
Hm...

11:52.128 --> 11:53.629
Hi, there.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.257
Excuse me. Sorry. Hi.
I'm looking for Roxie.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.509
I'm hoping
she can help me fix this.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.928
She expecting you?
Uh, no, but I...

12:00.970 --> 12:03.097
Then she's not in.
Okay.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.266
Meow.

12:05.307 --> 12:08.269
Been to friendlier
bars in South Philly

12:08.310 --> 12:09.645
on days when
the Eagles lost.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.021
(clears throat)
Maybe I could help.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.273
Hmm?

12:12.940 --> 12:15.192
I've seen you around.
Was hoping we'd meet again.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.362
Oh, right, I didn't recognize
you with your pants on.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.157
(chuckles) Seriously,
I can help you.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.075
That's a Summoning
Conch, right?

12:23.117 --> 12:24.910
Or at least... was.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.746
Mm. Yeah, uh,
here's the thing,

12:26.787 --> 12:28.122
I'm kind of
on a tight time line,

12:28.164 --> 12:29.498
and I don't know you,

12:29.540 --> 12:30.875
and I don't put
my personal business

12:30.916 --> 12:31.917
on the street
with strangers, so...

12:31.959 --> 12:33.669
Fair enough.
Name's Dev.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.838
And you are...?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.256
Very hard to impress.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.092
(vocalizing)

12:40.134 --> 12:42.178
(rumbling)

12:46.766 --> 12:48.684
What was that?

12:48.726 --> 12:50.102
It's like I was saying,
I can help you.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.605
I'm what's known
as a Ghandarva.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.857
The intersection
of music and magic

12:54.899 --> 12:57.735
happens to be my sweet spot,
so you might as well let me try,

12:57.777 --> 13:01.113
unless...
you got a better option.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.616
(sighs)

13:08.996 --> 13:11.457
Okay.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.167
I give.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.503
We did not come
all the way

13:15.544 --> 13:17.213
to a magical
freaking spa

13:17.254 --> 13:20.841
to sit side by side
like bitchy statues.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.301
I told you

13:22.343 --> 13:24.428
how I proposed
to a wonderful woman,

13:24.470 --> 13:27.723
and she ran away screaming.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.391
So, please, just let me in.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.812
All right, third strike.
I'm out.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.940
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry. I just,
I want to make things right.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.566
Right?

13:37.608 --> 13:39.527
You want to fix broken Maggie.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.196
Just like Jordan.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.157
Cross me off
your to-do list, Mel.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.451
I am a person.
I'm not a project.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.371
That is not fair.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.748
You attacked a human.

13:52.790 --> 13:53.958
That is so bad.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.253
He was harassing me.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.421
And I was...

13:59.463 --> 14:02.174
(sighs)
It's okay.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.385
I am not here to judge you.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.137
I don't want

14:07.179 --> 14:09.265
to talk about it, Mel.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.600
If you want
to help me, just...

14:11.642 --> 14:14.144
leave me alone.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.980
Okay.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.940
Fine.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.110
I'm going home.
Good.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.279
I'm staying right here,

14:23.320 --> 14:25.489
where you're not.

14:25.531 --> 14:26.740
(exhales)

14:26.782 --> 14:30.035
Finally, some peace and quiet.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.204
(vocalizing)

14:38.460 --> 14:41.547
No, no. All right. Mm.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.549
(resumes vocalizing)

14:43.591 --> 14:45.384
Okay. (laughs)

14:45.426 --> 14:47.428
Okay, can we just
speed this up, please?
You know, um,

14:47.469 --> 14:49.054
magic like this
is more of an art

14:49.096 --> 14:51.140
than a science.
You should know all about that.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.558
What do you mean?

14:52.600 --> 14:53.809
That searching look in your eye,

14:53.851 --> 14:55.144
trying to pry beauty and meaning

14:55.185 --> 14:56.729
out of everything
around you.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.480
Every artist has it.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.609
Uh, no. (clears throat) No.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.820
(chuckles) No.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.157
Okay, you get what art
means to me,

15:08.198 --> 15:09.992
and then...

15:10.034 --> 15:12.202
you get me.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.830
And, um... (clears throat)
then I'm in trouble.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.583
So, can we... can we just...

15:17.625 --> 15:21.211
Professionally speaking,

15:21.253 --> 15:23.797
what is your power?
Oh, um...

15:23.839 --> 15:26.258
I'm a manifester.
What?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.719
You're a manifester? Then what
are we messing with this for?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.304
You can just draw a new one.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.474
Uh, you could draw anything.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.392
Yeah, okay, well, clearly,
you don't know squat

15:35.434 --> 15:37.019
about manifestationing,

15:37.061 --> 15:38.437
and I don't really
have time to explain it

15:38.479 --> 15:40.397
to you, so can you just...
get to it.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.441
Oh...

15:42.483 --> 15:44.526
you're a newbie.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.448
(clicks tongue) You're
very lucky you ran into me.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.991
I can help you
with your real problem.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.036
The conch doesn't need fixing,
you do.

15:54.078 --> 15:57.581
(chuckles) And what
do you mean by that?

15:57.623 --> 16:00.125
What I mean is,
if you want this done fast,

16:00.167 --> 16:01.877
pick up your pen.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.094
MASSEUR:
Hi.

16:10.135 --> 16:13.806
Hi.
I'm here for the neck
and shoulder massage.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.358
Okay to proceed?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.235
Yeah, of course.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.035
Don't worry.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.204
You're in good hands.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.795
(alarm beeping)

16:52.761 --> 16:54.388
♪ Close your eyes
if you want to feel like ♪

16:54.430 --> 16:56.265
♪ You're the only one in here ♪

16:56.306 --> 16:58.100
♪ Singing... ♪

16:58.142 --> 16:59.643
Like Harry said...

17:01.478 --> 17:03.772
"Embrace the magic."

17:06.066 --> 17:08.944
I'm embracing the magic.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.779
(grunts)

17:10.821 --> 17:14.241
This... barely works
when I need it to, and

17:14.283 --> 17:16.160
it never works the same.
I mean,

17:16.201 --> 17:18.787
it basically only works
when I don't want it to.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.039
'Cause you're thinking too much.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.332
(scoffs) Okay, well,

17:22.374 --> 17:23.876
you're doing too little.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.713
Give me your hand.
Why?

17:27.755 --> 17:30.841
Can you trust me
for, like, one second?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.802
Please.
Okay.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.095
Now...

17:35.137 --> 17:37.723
what do you feel?

17:39.266 --> 17:40.809
A martini glass.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.771
I know it's a martini glass,
but what do you...

17:43.812 --> 17:45.314
feel?

17:45.355 --> 17:46.690
In your heart?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.194
Artists like us,
we don't just create

17:50.235 --> 17:52.571
from what we see and think,
but from our experiences.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.364
So, yes,
you're right,

17:54.406 --> 17:55.866
this is just a martini glass,

17:55.908 --> 17:57.785
but that's only half of it.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.830
I want you to draw a martini,

18:01.872 --> 18:05.000
but this time,
don't just think...

18:06.543 --> 18:08.337
...feel.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.259
(bell ringing)

18:14.301 --> 18:16.970
Hello? Anybody?

18:18.639 --> 18:21.767
I just want to get my things.

18:21.809 --> 18:25.062
Good to know customer service
sucks everywhere.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.272
(Arnold grunting)

18:29.274 --> 18:31.026
ARNOLD:
So much heavier
than you look...

18:31.068 --> 18:32.444
DEV:
Okay.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.363
Concentrate.

18:34.404 --> 18:37.407
Remember the anticipation
of the drink.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.661
The first taste
on your lips.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.788
The sensation
of the vermouth

18:42.830 --> 18:44.581
as it hits the back
of your throat.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.557
(chuckling)

19:01.598 --> 19:03.433
I, um...

19:03.475 --> 19:06.019
I've never manifested anything
without the drawing coming off

19:06.061 --> 19:07.229
the page before.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.691
And now, the final test.

19:10.732 --> 19:14.111
What? Oh, no, no, no.
Please don't do that. Last time

19:14.153 --> 19:17.197
someone tried one of my
creations, it-it turned badly.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.116
Like, they turned
two-dimensional...

19:19.158 --> 19:22.578
bad.
Yeah, because you
hadn't met me yet.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.746
(stammers)

19:24.788 --> 19:26.373
(inhales)

19:27.541 --> 19:28.750
Is it...?

19:28.792 --> 19:30.335
(gags)

19:30.377 --> 19:32.212
(coughing)

19:32.254 --> 19:33.630
What... what's happening?

19:33.672 --> 19:35.924
Oh, no. Help.
Dev!

19:35.966 --> 19:37.718
Help!

19:37.759 --> 19:41.096
No, no, no. This has way too
much vermouth in it. (laughing)

19:41.138 --> 19:43.473
Dude. (laughs)

19:43.515 --> 19:45.559
What the hell?

19:45.601 --> 19:48.520
See? I told you
nothing bad would happen.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.564
(winces)

19:55.485 --> 19:57.446
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.365
Oh...
Um...

20:00.407 --> 20:01.783
I jinxed it, didn't I?

20:01.825 --> 20:04.411
I think so.
Should we get out of here?

20:04.453 --> 20:07.456
E-Even for me, that was probably
one martini too many.
(glass shattering)

20:07.497 --> 20:09.166
Dude, I finally got
my power working,

20:09.208 --> 20:10.209
and now I can't
switch it off.
(glass shattering)

20:10.250 --> 20:11.752
Well, maybe
deep down inside

20:11.793 --> 20:13.170
you don't want
this moment to end.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.963
Oh, no, I really do.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.965
Especially since I'm no closer
to having a working conch.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.218
All right,
but you got to admit,

20:19.259 --> 20:20.844
things are trending
in the right direction.

20:20.886 --> 20:24.348
(chuckles)
You're beginning
to master your power,

20:24.389 --> 20:26.433
and you made
a new friend.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.645
(clears throat)

20:29.686 --> 20:31.313
(exhales)

20:31.355 --> 20:34.733
(groans)
That-that was a mistake.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.152
I'm really sorry.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.448
Oh. (chuckles)
That's how you stop it.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.284
Yup. (blows)

20:55.545 --> 20:57.381
(groans)

21:01.385 --> 21:03.595
Who are you?

21:03.637 --> 21:05.764
(sighs)

21:10.060 --> 21:13.021
It says your sister
was supposed to be here.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.648
Will she be joining?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.233
Oh...

21:16.275 --> 21:18.151
No, I-I don't...
I don't think so.

21:18.193 --> 21:19.152
Oh.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.154
Siblings, right?

21:21.196 --> 21:23.532
They never do what they say
they're going to.

21:23.573 --> 21:25.492
(groans) Tell me about it.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.328
You know, she said we were
coming here for some relaxation.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.540
Do you know what's
not relaxing? (sighs)

21:31.581 --> 21:34.376
Discussing and dissecting
how you went off the deep end.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.128
Aw.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.297
Well, you don't seem nuts to me.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.673
Thanks, uh...

21:41.049 --> 21:42.301
...Robert.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.636
You're the second Robert
I've met today.

21:44.678 --> 21:45.721
Oh.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.724
Okay, moving on
to your scalp.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.851
Okay.

21:52.936 --> 21:55.314
You know, I know she's just
trying to help, but...

21:55.355 --> 21:57.524
we're kind of out of practice
with the whole...

21:57.566 --> 22:00.861
sharing and talking thing,
and...

22:00.902 --> 22:02.904
This isn't like,
"I, you know,

22:02.946 --> 22:05.365
borrowed your sweater
and got salsa on it."

22:05.407 --> 22:07.284
This...

22:07.326 --> 22:10.162
this is serious.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.872
I abused my power.

22:11.913 --> 22:15.417
I've just been angry all the...

22:15.459 --> 22:18.754
Yeah, I've been angry
all the time, since...

22:20.255 --> 22:23.008
Anyways... Now we're dealing
with a real psycho,

22:23.050 --> 22:25.052
and I'm acting like him,
which is just

22:25.093 --> 22:26.762
disgusting-- Ow!

22:26.803 --> 22:27.929
Oh.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.931
I'm so sorry about that.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.683
Butterfingers.

22:34.269 --> 22:36.355
(grunting)

22:39.733 --> 22:41.651
Come on.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.736
What are you doing?

22:42.778 --> 22:44.196
Oh, Ms. Vera.

22:44.237 --> 22:45.489
Uh, how can I help you?

22:45.530 --> 22:46.865
Have you been enjoying yourself?

22:46.907 --> 22:48.408
What is in the bag?

22:48.450 --> 22:50.869
What bag? This bag? (chuckles)

22:50.911 --> 22:52.454
There's nothing in this bag.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.081
Oh, no, no, no.

22:54.122 --> 22:55.624
Ah...

22:57.751 --> 22:59.419
This isn't what it looks like.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.966
Okay, fine, this is exactly
what it looks like.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.511
I just want you to have
a five starfish experience.

23:07.552 --> 23:10.722
You need to tell me
what is going on right now.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.352
You're gonna stay
right here.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.645
Great. I'm gonna
get some matches

23:16.686 --> 23:18.146
and then
you're gone, okay?

23:18.188 --> 23:19.439
(sighs)

23:21.316 --> 23:24.027
Where are
the extra ones?
(alarm beeping)

23:26.822 --> 23:29.699
Merrow's Spring.
That's where Mel and Maggie are.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.702
What? Who-who did you say?

23:32.744 --> 23:36.039
So the rumors are true.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.666
You're the new Charmed One?

23:37.707 --> 23:39.709
Uh, I can't
do this right now, dude.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.753
You know, there are, like,
theories out there about you.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.047
Like you're some sort
of Charmed One puppet meant

23:44.089 --> 23:45.424
to keep them in power.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.092
Some people say
you're not even related.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.052
I-I don't think that.
You don't seem like one of them.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.345
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

23:50.387 --> 23:51.930
Uh...
You know what?
Never mind.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.473
That red light means that
Mel or Maggie are in danger.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.808
And I'm the only one who can
help if I can figure out

23:54.850 --> 23:56.184
how to get
this damn thing working!

23:56.226 --> 23:57.686
Okay. Let me.
No! Don't!

23:57.727 --> 23:59.271
(high-pitched whirring)

24:01.606 --> 24:03.024
What the hell did you do?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.158
(whooshing)

24:11.199 --> 24:13.618
There's got to be
a circuit box here somewhere.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.036
DEV:
Anything I can do?

24:15.078 --> 24:16.746
Obviously not.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.874
Only witches are supposed
to touch the board,

24:18.915 --> 24:21.793
not randos
who can't take a hint.

24:23.211 --> 24:27.007
Damn it. I had one job
to do, and I blew it.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.135
You need three pinches
of henbane,

24:30.177 --> 24:32.179
six teaspoons of red salt
and a dash of mugwort.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.097
It's a reconfiguration potion.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.808
It fixes objects back
to their original state.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.101
It should help with the board.

24:38.143 --> 24:41.438
And the conch, too.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.859
You could have fixed the conch
this whole time?

24:45.901 --> 24:49.613
I was... kind of hoping
to get to know you first.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.823
To get to know me?

24:51.865 --> 24:53.825
Okay, dude, I like
having a good time,

24:53.867 --> 24:56.161
but not at the expense
of people who trust me.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.079
Yeah, honestly...
People who count on me!

24:58.121 --> 24:59.873
I honestly didn't realize
how dire the situation was.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.958
What's wrong with you?
You're so cool,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.294
and the more we talked, the
more things snowballed, and...

25:05.837 --> 25:08.048
I'm sorry.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.342
You said henbane?

25:10.383 --> 25:12.302
Yeah.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.264
(sighs)

25:17.265 --> 25:19.226
Okay.

25:19.267 --> 25:22.854
Listen, I'm still pissed at you,
but I need your help,

25:22.896 --> 25:25.649
so you're gonna come
and help me.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.651
I am so sorry. It's just,
there's never been a death

25:27.692 --> 25:29.778
at the spa before, so of course
it happens on the day

25:29.819 --> 25:31.530
the actual Charmed Ones are
here. I guess I panicked, and...

25:31.571 --> 25:32.864
Please shut up!

25:33.823 --> 25:35.617
(sighs)

25:35.659 --> 25:37.744
Maggie?

25:40.038 --> 25:41.122
Please don't vanquish me!

25:41.164 --> 25:43.124
What? No.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.834
(exhales)
We'll figure out
what happened here.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.587
But first, I need to make sure
that my sister's okay.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.507
Oh, yes, of course.
And I can help with that.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.760
According to

25:53.802 --> 25:56.555
the schedule, Maggie should be
in the aromatherapy room.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.557
And where is that?
It's just down the breezeway,

25:58.598 --> 26:01.560
third door to the left,
but, uh, fair warning.

26:01.601 --> 26:04.521
Our aromatherapy room
is a little different.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.606
It uses scents to bring people
back to a needed happy memory.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.066
So when you do enter,

26:08.108 --> 26:09.818
you will be in
Maggie's session, and

26:09.859 --> 26:12.571
it may be... personal.

26:12.612 --> 26:13.738
(scoffs)

26:22.497 --> 26:24.165
Hello there.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.845
(water gurgling)

26:44.519 --> 26:46.605
(liquid gurgling)

26:51.109 --> 26:52.527
Maggie?

26:52.569 --> 26:54.863
(inhales)

26:59.743 --> 27:01.369
What the hell?

27:01.411 --> 27:05.081
Mel, where the hell are you?

27:05.123 --> 27:06.750
I'm right here.

27:07.667 --> 27:11.129
I think they're ready.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.983
Wait. Are you the real you?

27:32.025 --> 27:33.485
Or was the you
that passed through me...?

27:33.526 --> 27:35.153
I'm me.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.738
Oh, thank God you're okay.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.574
Wait.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.160
Are you okay?

27:44.120 --> 27:47.832
I was just watching us
from four years ago,

27:47.874 --> 27:49.959
you know,
before all the witch stuff.

27:51.795 --> 27:54.381
We were so busy, and we thought
our problems were so big,

27:54.422 --> 27:57.133
but we always found time
to raid the fridge.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.011
And make the most monstrous
garbage nachos imaginable.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.472
I'm pretty sure that's why
I decided to go vegan.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.432
Yeah.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.730
I-I'm sorry
for what I said earlier.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.734
I don't want you
to leave me alone.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.862
But last night,

28:17.904 --> 28:19.864
I lost control.

28:19.906 --> 28:23.326
I hurt a man.
I felt his nose break.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.455
I mean, the sound
he made was...

28:29.416 --> 28:31.751
Now I have a court date
in a week.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.505
And I knew that telling you
would mean I'd have to face it,

28:35.547 --> 28:37.257
and I wasn't ready.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.970
But I guess now
I'm glad I'm telling you

28:42.011 --> 28:43.638
because you can help me
through it.

28:45.515 --> 28:49.394
And I'm here to help
with the whole Ruby situation.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.732
But just promise me
we'll share all the stuff,

28:53.773 --> 28:55.984
not just the trauma.

28:57.777 --> 29:01.239
I want to, like,
do your hair and gossip

29:01.281 --> 29:03.742
about stupid
reality shows.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.748
I just really want
to be with my sister.

29:09.789 --> 29:11.916
Yeah.

29:14.711 --> 29:19.466
You know, I know it can't be
exactly how it was, but...

29:20.717 --> 29:22.719
...maybe it could be close.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.597
Deal.

29:25.638 --> 29:26.598
(chuckles)

29:26.639 --> 29:28.641
(sniffles)

29:28.683 --> 29:30.935
Hey, why'd you come back here?

29:30.977 --> 29:35.356
Well, there's no easy way
to say this, but...

29:35.398 --> 29:36.608
there's been a murder.

29:36.649 --> 29:38.443
What? Someone died,

29:38.485 --> 29:40.111
and you didn't
immediately say something?

29:40.153 --> 29:41.780
Well, you were having a moment.

29:41.821 --> 29:45.200
ARNOLD (distance): Step away
from the fountain, and...

29:45.241 --> 29:46.701
(indistinct shouting)
What was that?

29:46.743 --> 29:49.454
ARNOLD:
Stay back!
For your safety, please.

29:52.373 --> 29:53.666
Donnie, get these people
out of here.

29:53.708 --> 29:54.876
Something's
definitely not right.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.669
Sure doesn't
smell right.
Oh!

29:56.711 --> 29:58.755
What the hell...
Phew!

29:58.797 --> 30:00.924
...is going on?
I don't know.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.300
Someone must
have tainted the spring

30:02.342 --> 30:04.511
because the bloom,
our pride and joy,

30:04.552 --> 30:06.554
looks and smells
like a nightmare.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.348
Oh, just when I thought
things couldn't get any worse.

30:08.389 --> 30:09.808
First Robert dies,

30:09.849 --> 30:11.309
and now...
Did you say "Robert"?

30:12.811 --> 30:16.189
He just gave me a massage.

30:16.231 --> 30:20.151
♪ Uh-hmm-hmm,
uh-hmm-hmm, hmm ♪

30:20.193 --> 30:22.779
♪ Hmm, hmm, uh-hmm-hmm. ♪

30:29.494 --> 30:31.246
Okay, if this doesn't work, and
you're messing with me again,

30:31.287 --> 30:33.081
I'm gonna manifest
an anvil over your head.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.752
(whooshing)

30:43.675 --> 30:45.802
Hey.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.638
(whirring, beeping)

30:48.680 --> 30:51.391
So, we gonna save
the day now or what?

30:51.432 --> 30:54.060
No. There's no more "we."

30:54.102 --> 30:56.771
I got to go.
Okay.

30:56.813 --> 31:00.149
Now.
Right, well, then,
till next time...

31:00.191 --> 31:01.150
Oh, I didn't
get your name.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.735
It's Kaela.
Well,

31:02.777 --> 31:04.153
if you need me, Kaela,

31:04.195 --> 31:06.155
(singsongy):
you know where to find me.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.408
(laughs)

31:10.285 --> 31:12.495
Okay, y'all, I'm coming.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.539
DONNIE:
Right this way.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.707
Thank you. Please remain calm.
MAGGIE:
I'm gonna have to take

31:15.748 --> 31:17.125
at least four showers.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.668
I can't believe

31:18.710 --> 31:20.086
this Tally-weirdo had
his hands all over me.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.588
The lamia, the leprechaun,
and now here?

31:21.629 --> 31:23.423
How does he know where
to keep finding us?

31:23.464 --> 31:24.757
I don't know. But I know
that when I do find him...

31:24.799 --> 31:27.302
I don't...
I don't feel so good.

31:27.343 --> 31:28.636
Hey, it's okay.
We got you.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.263
Oh, my God.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.514
What the hell is that?

31:31.556 --> 31:34.142
(whimpers)
What is going on?

31:34.183 --> 31:35.810
ARNOLD:
Someone poisoned the water lily.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.062
It's shooting thorns.

31:38.104 --> 31:39.939
(woman yelling)
I'll stay here

31:39.981 --> 31:41.357
and help him. You
go get the Tallyman.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.984
Are you sure?

31:43.026 --> 31:44.903
Positive. I think I've beaten up
enough people this week.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.280
(groans)

31:47.322 --> 31:48.698
(thorns whooshing)

31:48.740 --> 31:50.241
(woman gasps, thuds)

31:50.283 --> 31:51.659
What in
The Little Shop of Horrors?

31:51.701 --> 31:54.078
(thorns whooshing, smacking)

31:54.120 --> 31:55.997
(Arnold groans)

31:56.039 --> 31:58.207
(Maggie gasps)

32:00.168 --> 32:03.004
(gasps)
Hey, you!

32:08.801 --> 32:10.511
(thorns whooshing)

32:10.553 --> 32:12.847
What the hell?

32:12.889 --> 32:14.557
Mel? Maggie!

32:14.599 --> 32:17.977
Kaela? What are you doing here?

32:18.019 --> 32:19.520
I saw your light,
and-and it went red,

32:19.562 --> 32:21.522
and... I broke the conch.

32:21.564 --> 32:24.150
We'll talk about that later.
Just get over here, stay down.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.818
Okay.
(whooshing continues)

32:25.860 --> 32:26.945
(whimpers)

32:27.904 --> 32:30.865
(panting)

32:31.824 --> 32:33.743
What's going on?

32:33.785 --> 32:36.037
Oh, you know,
you try to relax for a day,

32:36.079 --> 32:38.331
have a mai tai,
get a foot massage, and then,

32:38.373 --> 32:41.167
the Tallyman poisons a magical
spring, and you're under attack

32:41.209 --> 32:42.627
from a killer plant.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.587
Tuesdays. Am I right?
(chuckles)

32:44.629 --> 32:47.256
(man groans, Kaela gasps)

32:47.298 --> 32:49.092
MAGGIE:
I got to get
to those bath bombs.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.094
If I can do a purification
incantation over them,

32:51.135 --> 32:52.637
lob them into the spring,

32:52.679 --> 32:54.389
it might counteract
the Tallyman's poison.

32:54.430 --> 32:56.099
Though I might die
in the process.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.351
I have an idea.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.814
Ugh.

33:07.276 --> 33:09.570
I'm in the Tallyman's memory.

33:13.574 --> 33:15.618
Come on.
You can do it.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.371
I... I can't.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.748
Listen, this
is our power.

33:20.790 --> 33:25.628
We can stop any mechanical
object, and it can't hurt us.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.463
It defines you as a gremlin,

33:27.505 --> 33:29.799
and there's no way

33:29.841 --> 33:32.385
that my little brother
doesn't have it.

33:32.427 --> 33:35.179
Here. Watch me.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.141
(mechanical rumbling)

33:45.773 --> 33:48.359
What the hell
is this?

33:50.987 --> 33:52.947
Your turn.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.615
KAELA:
I know what I have to do.

33:55.742 --> 33:58.161
Great use of color and space,
but how is this helping us?

33:58.202 --> 33:59.954
Just wait for it.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.622
You need a lot
of bath bombs,

34:01.664 --> 34:03.708
I'll get you a lot
of bath bombs.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.877
(whooshing, thudding and
overlapping shouting continue)

34:08.129 --> 34:10.840
Yes! Yes!

34:13.134 --> 34:15.428
(rapid whooshing and thudding)

34:18.389 --> 34:20.183
That's enough.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.185
(whooshing
and thudding continues)

34:22.226 --> 34:24.520
Let's do this.
You know
the Purification Incantation?

34:26.731 --> 34:28.649
I did a little light reading
in the command center.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.611
Okay.

34:32.779 --> 34:37.116
BOTH:
Hoc expurga
ad omnia mala pugnanda.

34:37.158 --> 34:40.620
(whirring)

34:40.661 --> 34:43.372
Ready?
Yeah. (grunts)

34:44.332 --> 34:46.125
(whooshing continues)

34:47.251 --> 34:50.004
(grunting)

34:50.046 --> 34:52.381
(both panting)

34:52.423 --> 34:54.383
Oh, my God.
(grunts)

34:56.052 --> 34:59.305
MAGGIE:
If this works, it should
reverse whatever he did.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.642
(overlapping shouting
and chatter continue)

35:02.683 --> 35:05.186
It's-it's never worked for me
before, and-and Mom says...

35:05.228 --> 35:07.396
Don't listen to her.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.315
You were a baby, right?

35:10.608 --> 35:12.151
Now you're 18. You're a man.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.322
You just have
to believe in yourself.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.952
I-I believe.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.832
(engine rumbling
and clattering)

35:27.792 --> 35:30.128
I believe!

35:30.169 --> 35:32.255
I-I believe!

35:33.506 --> 35:35.049
I believe.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.718
(yelling, bone crunching)

35:40.555 --> 35:43.599
What a disappointment.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.102
This is a happy memory?

35:46.144 --> 35:48.020
(yelling)

35:48.062 --> 35:49.730
(distant screaming
and whimpering)

35:49.772 --> 35:51.691
Oh, God, what is he up to now?

35:51.732 --> 35:54.569
(both grunting)

36:10.585 --> 36:12.170
Hey. You good?

36:13.379 --> 36:16.340
Hey. Huh.
Hey.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.179
(sighs)

36:23.389 --> 36:25.600
Most soothing day ever.

36:25.641 --> 36:28.269
(laughter)

36:34.817 --> 36:36.736
Oh. (laughs)

36:36.777 --> 36:40.573
Hey, look, I love
being a part of this,

36:40.615 --> 36:43.284
but I'm thinking
maybe I should

36:43.326 --> 36:44.994
tap out
of serious witch business.

36:45.036 --> 36:48.623
Today, you guys left me alone
for four hours,

36:48.664 --> 36:50.708
and I broke Mel's conch,
shut down the witchboard,

36:50.750 --> 36:54.795
and accidentally let some guy
into the command center.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.964
(laughs)
I think maybe I'm not ready.

36:57.006 --> 37:00.176
Screwing up is part
of the process, trust me.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.095
We need you.

37:03.137 --> 37:07.266
♪ It can't be that easy... ♪

37:07.308 --> 37:09.101
Okay, well,
there is another issue.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.146
People are talking.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.024
About?

37:15.066 --> 37:18.069
About where I came from,
about who I am really,

37:18.110 --> 37:19.862
if I'm legit or not.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.405
I know

37:21.447 --> 37:22.949
that I've been saying
I don't want

37:22.990 --> 37:24.575
to look
into my biological parents.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.827
Which... we respect that choice.

37:26.869 --> 37:29.705
Mm.
I think maybe now I have to.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.540
We'll figure out a way...

37:31.582 --> 37:33.584
together.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.586
Are you sure?

37:35.628 --> 37:39.173
I mean, like, it could bring up

37:39.215 --> 37:41.217
some messy family secrets.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.718
Please.

37:43.886 --> 37:47.265
Everything about us is messy.
Exhibit A.

37:47.306 --> 37:49.517
Yes.
(giggling)
It's a lot of chili.

37:49.558 --> 37:50.768
More cheese.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.979
Chili peppers,
more cheese.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.480
Oh! (laughs)
Oh!

37:55.439 --> 37:57.400
♪ It's fine... ♪

37:57.441 --> 38:01.112
Oh, Brynn's got our backs.
What's up?

38:01.153 --> 38:02.989
I told her
about our non-relaxing spa day,

38:03.030 --> 38:04.740
and she used
the Marriott Bonvoy App

38:04.782 --> 38:08.035
to book us a vacation
away from our vacation.

38:08.077 --> 38:11.580
Ooh. No magical spring?
I am in.

38:11.622 --> 38:13.416
(laughs)
MAGGIE:
Speaking of our

38:13.457 --> 38:15.167
zero-starfish-rated experience--

38:15.209 --> 38:18.546
I can't stop thinking
about the Tallyman.

38:18.587 --> 38:22.133
Hmm.
I mean, he literally had
his cold hands around me,

38:22.174 --> 38:24.427
and didn't do anything.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.054
Maybe he was too afraid
to take a shot.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.223
He's not the boogeyman.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.600
Seems like he doesn't
have any power at all.

38:31.642 --> 38:36.647
He's just a really angry
gremlin with a grudge.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.399
I saw that little gremlin's
happiest memory,

38:38.441 --> 38:40.109
which was seriously messed up.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.361
Total psychopath fuel.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.155
So, what's his endgame?

38:44.196 --> 38:46.615
We'll figure it out... tomorrow.

38:46.657 --> 38:49.785
Okay? Tonight,
we're gonna have fun!
MAGGIE: Mm-hmm.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.371
(gasps)

38:53.748 --> 38:55.791
Did you do that?

38:55.833 --> 38:58.044
D-Don't look at me.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.129
MEL:
7:08.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.506
That's the time it disappeared.

39:04.592 --> 39:07.762
Earlier today,
I was trying to stop time,

39:07.803 --> 39:11.182
and I thought
I destroyed the clock, but...

39:11.223 --> 39:13.392
Oh, my God.

39:13.434 --> 39:17.021
I think I sent it through time.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.525
♪ Every time
they call your name ♪
Whoa.

39:21.567 --> 39:26.781

MAN:
Hey, did you see this?

39:31.535 --> 39:33.871
WOMAN:
Is this real?
(chiming)

39:33.913 --> 39:36.832
DEV:
I know. I know.

39:36.874 --> 39:38.751
You'd think
I'd had enough of these,

39:38.793 --> 39:41.962
but I had a close encounter of
the very confusing kind today.

39:42.004 --> 39:44.006
Dunc, my man,
question for you.

39:44.048 --> 39:47.259
Have you ever met someone
who is more and less...

39:47.301 --> 39:49.762
and more
than they appear to be?

39:49.804 --> 39:51.597
(chiming, whooshing)
FEMALE:
You can't be serious.

39:51.639 --> 39:55.267
MALE: The Charmed
Ones are disgusting.

39:55.309 --> 39:57.770
FEMALE:
It's so callous.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.189
MALE: They just let
that poor lamia die.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.690
MALE 2:
That's awful.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.692
She tried to kill Kaela.
That's enough for me.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.279
FEMALE:
Oh!

40:07.321 --> 40:08.572
MALE 3:
Hey, did you see that?

40:08.614 --> 40:10.157
And did you see what
happened at the spa?

40:10.199 --> 40:11.909
FEMALE 3: They just
sat there and laughed.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.161
MALE:
Maybe someone
doctored those videos.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.579
They could be fakes.

40:15.621 --> 40:17.331
FEMALE 4::
I never trusted them.

40:17.373 --> 40:20.167
(indistinct chatter)

40:20.209 --> 40:22.169
This can't be true.

40:22.211 --> 40:24.046
Please.
You're so gullible.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.965
The Charmed Ones
are no heroes.

40:26.006 --> 40:28.342
If you're not a witch,
you're on your own.

40:28.384 --> 40:31.846
Can we just have one nice night
out without a tirade, please?

40:31.887 --> 40:34.932
Fine. If you don't want to hear
the truth, then that's on you.

40:36.350 --> 40:40.104
It's shocking,
but you know what they say.

40:40.146 --> 40:43.023
Never meet your heroes.
