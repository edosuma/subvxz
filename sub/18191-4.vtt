WEBVTT

00:01.768 --> 00:04.605
PREVIOUSLY
ON "CHASING LIFE"...

00:04.637 --> 00:06.206
YOU'RE LIKE THE FIRST
PERSON I'VE EVER DATED

00:06.240 --> 00:09.176
THAT I CAN ACTUALLY
SEE A FUTURE WITH.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.010
HOW LONG SINCE
YOU'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED?

00:11.044 --> 00:13.480
- ABOUT A WEEK.
- HOW DID YOUR FAMILY REACT
TO THE NEWS?

00:13.513 --> 00:15.648
- I HAVEN'T TOLD THEM YET.
- HEY, STAN?

00:15.682 --> 00:17.585
I QUIT.

00:17.617 --> 00:21.254
THIS WAS JUST
A LOT ALL AT ONCE.

00:21.288 --> 00:24.557
- THOMAS CARVER.
ANY RELATION?
- MY DAD.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.495
THIS IS REALLY GONNA HELP
THE CAMPAIGN, MR. HENDRIE.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.663
- Danny: HENDRIE WAS HERE?
- April: YEAH, I SAW HIM
IN THE ELEVATOR

00:29.696 --> 00:31.532
WITH HIS OBNOXIOUS SON LEO.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.366
I HAVE A PITCH
FOR MY FIRST PIECE--

00:33.401 --> 00:35.569
- BRUCE'S SON LEO.
- Lawrence: WE CAN'T GO THERE.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.570
- WHY?
- LEO HENDRIE IS OFF-LIMITS.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.573
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
GOING TO A SUPPORT GROUP?

00:39.606 --> 00:42.143
April:
I'M NOT REALLY
THE SUPPORT-GROUP TYPE.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.688
I KNOW I HAVEN'T
STOPPED BY IN A WHILE.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.191
YOU ALL PROBABLY
THOUGHT I DIED,
WHICH IS FUNNY,

00:57.223 --> 00:59.159
'CAUSE IT COULD BE TRUE.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.561
FOR THOSE OF YOU
I HAVEN'T MET, I'M LEO.

01:01.594 --> 01:05.733
UM, THE TUMOR
ON MY BRAINSTEM IS LEO JR.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.734
- ( people chuckle )
- HE'S A LITTLE TOO SHY

01:07.768 --> 01:09.670
TO COME OUT
AND SAY HELLO RIGHT NOW.

01:09.703 --> 01:13.706
BUT DON'T WORRY,
HE'S GETTING MORE AND MORE
CONFIDENT EVERY DAY OR--

01:13.740 --> 01:16.644
WHAT'S THE WORD
MY DOCTOR USED?
--AGGRESSIVE.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.313
GRADE II ASTROCYTOMA,

01:19.346 --> 01:21.081
WHICH AS IT TURNS OUT
IS A GOOD GRADE,

01:21.114 --> 01:22.750
SO I'M PROUD
OF THE LITTLE GUY.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.518
( people chuckle )

01:24.551 --> 01:25.786
FOR ANYONE
WHO KNOWS MY FAMILY...

01:26.820 --> 01:28.688
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY MY DAD

01:28.722 --> 01:31.692
RECENTLY DECIDED
TO DROP OUR...

01:31.724 --> 01:34.694
SMALL BROOD
INTO THE PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT.

01:34.728 --> 01:39.299
AND WHILE I'M USED
TO MICROSCOPES AT THIS POINT,

01:39.332 --> 01:43.370
HAVING SPENT SO MUCH TIME
LOOKING AT MY OWN BRAIN
THROUGH ONE,

01:43.403 --> 01:45.772
THE SCRUTINY
OF MY DAD'S DECISION

01:45.805 --> 01:50.710
HAS MADE DEALING
WITH LEO JR. EVEN...

01:51.745 --> 01:53.414
WORSE THAN THE LAST TIME.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.850
ANYHOW,
MORAL OF THE STORY:

01:56.884 --> 01:59.686
DON'T GET
A BRAIN TUMOR, KIDS.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.789
- THEY SUCK.
- ( murmuring )

02:01.822 --> 02:03.224
Man: RIGHT.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.427
( woman sighs )
I HAVE A QUESTION.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.631
MY FIANCé HAS DECIDED
TO SHAVE HIS HEAD

02:10.663 --> 02:13.199
- IN SOLIDARITY WITH ME...
- Man #2: NICE.

02:13.234 --> 02:16.736
...BUT HE DOES NOT
HAVE THE FACE FOR IT.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.840
- ( laughter )
- HOW AM I GONNA BREAK
THAT NEWS TO HIM?

02:19.873 --> 02:21.408
YOU KNOW?

02:25.312 --> 02:27.313
( chattering )

02:32.353 --> 02:34.788
SO YOU'RE NOT THE CLERK
FROM BLOOMIES.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.191
- ( clears throat ) EXCUSE ME?
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
AT FIRST.

02:37.223 --> 02:38.626
I MEAN,
YOU LOOK SO FAMILIAR

02:38.658 --> 02:40.493
AND JUST CHECK OUT
WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

02:40.527 --> 02:43.764
THEN IT HIT ME--
PARKING GARAGE OUTSIDE
MY DAD'S OFFICE.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.733
YOU'RE THE REASON I DROPPED
A GRAND FIXING MY BIKE.

02:45.765 --> 02:48.235
- I THINK YOU'VE
GOT THE WRONG PERSON.
- THEN I SAW YOU AGAIN

02:48.269 --> 02:50.670
AT "THE BOSTON POST."
IN THE ELEVATOR?

02:50.704 --> 02:53.774
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE HERE
TO GET THE BIG SCOOP

02:53.807 --> 02:55.843
ON BRUCE HENDRIE'S
CANCER KID, AREN'T YOU?

02:55.876 --> 02:58.211
- I--
- NO, UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU...

02:58.245 --> 02:59.712
( whispers )
I NEVER FORGET A FACE,

02:59.747 --> 03:02.383
( normal voice )
WHICH IS SURPRISING,
I KNOW, CONSIDERING...

03:02.415 --> 03:05.218
- ( chuckles ) NOW I'M NOT
A RELIGIOUS MAN...
- I DIDN'T--

03:05.252 --> 03:06.719
...BUT I DO THINK

03:06.753 --> 03:10.557
THAT STALKING SOMEONE
AT AN ANONYMOUS CANCER
SUPPORT GROUP

03:10.591 --> 03:12.225
WILL DEFINITELY EARN YOU
A SPOT IN HELL.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.760
I'D HAVE TO CHECK
THE BIBLE FIRST AND GET
BACK TO YOU, THOUGH.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.329
- LEO, JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.
- ARE WE ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS?

03:16.362 --> 03:17.931
OH, I DIDN'T CATCH YOURS.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.533
- I'M JUST--
- ONE LETTER,
I'M A REALLY GOOD GUESSER.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.937
- YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.
- REALLY?

03:24.737 --> 03:26.907
- ( scoffs )
- OR "RHYMES WITH"
COULD WORK. ANYTHING.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.877
I'LL FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE,

03:29.909 --> 03:31.611
AND SO WILL MY DAD.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.348
ONLY THE GUILTY RUN!

- ( alarm stops )
- APRIL.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.848
WAKE UP!

04:08.882 --> 04:11.685
- APRIL.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:11.718 --> 04:14.555
YOUR ALARM'S BEEN GOING OFF
FOR LIKE THE PAST 20 MINUTES.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.589
- WHAT, ARE YOU DRUNK
OR SOMETHING?
- ( sighs )

04:16.624 --> 04:19.425
YEAH, I'M STEALING
A MOVE FROM YOUR PLAYBOOK.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.793
WAIT, REALLY?

04:20.827 --> 04:24.331
NO, I JUST FEEL TIRED...

04:25.832 --> 04:28.369
AND LATE.
GOD, I'M SO LATE.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.937
- ( door opens, closes )
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.706
Sara:
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
WORRYING ABOUT IT.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.709
- ( Beth chuckles )
- THE POINT IS YOU HAVE
ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.812
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

04:38.846 --> 04:41.615
- HEY, DUDE.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:41.649 --> 04:45.418
- IT'S 7:00 IN THE MORNING.
- I'M USED TO OPENING A COFFEE
SHOP AT 5:00 A.M. EVERY DAY,

04:45.451 --> 04:47.788
SO THIS IS LIKE...
LUNCHTIME FOR ME.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.590
BETH IS TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT SHE WANTS

04:49.622 --> 04:51.824
TO DO WITH HER LIFE,
AND I WAS REMINDING HER--

04:51.858 --> 04:54.394
USE THIS TIME FOR SOME
POSITIVE IDENTITY BUILDING.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.295
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM'S
NOT BAD WITH THE ADVICE.

04:56.329 --> 04:57.930
I CAN SEE WHY
SHE CHARGES SO MUCH FOR IT.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.733
- THIS IS CAFFEINATED, RIGHT?
- Sara: YEAH.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.069
WERE YOU UP LATE, HONEY?

05:03.302 --> 05:06.005
OH YEAH, JUST WORKING
ON THIS LAST-MINUTE REWRITE.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.841
UH, I'M-- I'M OKAY.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.942
BETH, PROMISE ME
YOU'LL GET MY DAUGHTER OUT

05:09.976 --> 05:11.577
AND MAKE SURE
SHE HAS SOME FUN.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.514
AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE ME
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE

05:13.547 --> 05:14.882
THAT TANGO CLASS
TOMORROW NIGHT.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.315
WHAT TANGO CLASS?

05:16.350 --> 05:17.850
OH, YOUR MOM BOOKED A CLASS
AT THIS DANCE STUDIO,

05:17.884 --> 05:19.586
BUT SHE WAS THINKING
OF NOT GOING.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.021
WHY? YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT LEARNING
TANGO FOR YEARS.

05:22.055 --> 05:25.024
- WHY WOULDN'T YOU GO?
- 'CAUSE I SIGNED UP
WITH BEN AS MY PARTNER.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.860
NOW HE'S NOT
IN THE PICTURE ANYMORE,

05:26.894 --> 05:28.327
I CAN'T GO ALONE.
YOU KNOW...

05:28.362 --> 05:29.997
- Both: TWO TO TANGO.
- RIGHT.

05:30.029 --> 05:33.500
- WHAT ABOUT GRANDMA?
- SHE'S AT HER BRIDGE TOURNAMENT
IN BALTIMORE.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.334
- IT'S FINE.
- THEN I'LL DO IT.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.471
- REALLY?
- YOU WERE JUST SAYING

05:38.504 --> 05:40.340
I NEED TO TAKE
A NIGHT OFF. WHY NOT?

05:40.374 --> 05:43.043
WELL, YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND
YOUR FREE TIME WITH YOUR MOTHER.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.012
I'M SURE YOU'D RATHER
GO OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS

05:45.045 --> 05:46.913
- OR GO ON A DATE WITH--
- STOP. THE ONLY PERSON

05:46.947 --> 05:48.781
I WANT TO HAVE A DATE WITH
TOMORROW NIGHT IS YOU.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.050
- JUST ONE THING, THOUGH.
- WHAT?

05:51.084 --> 05:53.586
DO WE HAVE TO
CLENCH ROSES IN OUR TEETH
AND STARE AT EACH OTHER?

05:53.620 --> 05:54.588
'CAUSE THAT MIGHT GET
A LITTLE WEIRD.

05:54.620 --> 05:55.889
( laughs )

05:55.923 --> 05:58.591
I REALLY LUCKED OUT
IN THE DAUGHTER DEPARTMENT.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.860
MMM. BYE.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.028
Beth: BYE.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.600
ARE YOU REALLY OKAY?
IT'S NOT THE C-WORD IS IT?

06:06.632 --> 06:08.569
NO, I'M JUST--
I'M TIRED,

06:08.601 --> 06:10.937
AND I'M LATE
FOR MY BIOPSY THING.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.040
YOU MEAN THE THING WHERE
THEY SCREW A NEEDLE

06:13.072 --> 06:14.975
INTO YOUR HIP BONE
AND SUCK OUT THE BONE MARROW?

06:15.007 --> 06:18.011
- I'M COMING WITH YOU.
- NO, YOU ARE STAYING

06:18.045 --> 06:20.012
AND YOU ARE
GONNA FIGURE OUT WHAT
YOU WANNA DO WITH YOUR LIFE.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.915
I CAN TOTALLY
HANDLE THIS ON MY OWN.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.016
THE ONLY C-WORDS
I AM WORRIED ABOUT TODAY

06:24.050 --> 06:27.920
ARE CAFFEINE AND CONCEALER.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.062
( George speaking softly )

06:35.095 --> 06:36.396
UNCLE GEORGE?

06:37.898 --> 06:39.566
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.870
YEAH, OKAY.
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT, OKAY?

06:42.903 --> 06:43.903
I'LL BE BACK.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.942
UH, APRIL,
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CONSULT.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.512
I SHOWED UP AT MASS MEDICAL
AND THEY SAID YOU LEFT.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.880
WELL, I ASSUMED
YOU WERE BLOWING IT OFF,
AS PER USUAL.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.682
I WASN'T, I PROMISE.
I SLEPT THROUGH MY ALARM,

06:56.716 --> 06:58.485
AND THEN BECAUSE I OVERSLEPT
I MISSED THE TRAIN.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.821
RIGHT. WELL, SORRY.
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO RESCHEDULE.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.689
BUT I GOT MYSELF
ALL PSYCHED UP.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.757
AND TODAY'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A SLOW DAY AT WORK.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.661
ALL RIGHT-- NO, WAIT.
WHY'D YOU OVERSLEEP?

07:07.694 --> 07:10.430
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I WORK HARD, I PLAY HARD.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.499
- I GET TIRED.
- OR IT'S A SYMPTOM.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.834
YOU HAD ANY NOSEBLEEDS,
BLEEDING GUMS,

07:14.867 --> 07:16.870
- FAINTING SPELLS?
- NO.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.038
THE SEVERITY
OF THE SYMPTOMS
LETS ME KNOW

07:19.072 --> 07:21.141
JUST HOW RAPIDLY
THE CANCER IS PROGRESSING,

07:21.175 --> 07:24.177
WHICH WOULD DEFINITELY
CHANGE SOME THINGS.

07:24.211 --> 07:27.514
- LIKE WHAT?
- LIKE YOU WORKING AT ALL.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.216
THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
I FEEL FINE.

07:30.449 --> 07:32.151
( scoffs )
I...

07:32.185 --> 07:34.086
GOTTA GET BACK
TO MY CONSULT.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.088
DO ME A FAVOR:
GO SEE THE NURSE

07:36.122 --> 07:38.524
AND RESCHEDULE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.894
- OKAY. THANKS.
- OKAY. YEAH, AND APRIL?

07:41.928 --> 07:43.730
NEXT TIME DON'T BE LATE.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.865
( sighs )

07:59.079 --> 08:01.514
( knocks )
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

08:02.682 --> 08:03.884
YOU'RE A STAFF WRITER, RIGHT?

08:03.916 --> 08:06.954
- UH, YEAH.
- OH, OKAY.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.088
I WAS CONFUSED SINCE
WE HAD A STAFF MEETING

08:09.122 --> 08:10.223
THIS MORNING
AND YOU WEREN'T HERE.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.559
SORRY, I HAD
A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

08:12.593 --> 08:16.495
IT'S FUNNY.
I THINK THE ONLY TIME
I'VE TAKEN OFF WORK

08:16.529 --> 08:18.831
FOR HEALTH REASONS
WAS WHEN I HAD TO HAVE
MY APPENDIX TAKEN OUT.

08:18.865 --> 08:22.134
ACTUALLY, NO.
WAIT, I DID THAT ON A SUNDAY.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.172
- DID YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE?
- YEAH.

08:25.204 --> 08:29.141
I NEED YOU TO LOOK OVER
MY NOTES FROM THE WATERFRONT
UNION PIECE.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.144
DOUBLE-CHECK MY SOURCES
AND CROSS-REFERENCE THE FACTS

08:31.177 --> 08:34.014
- IN CASE I MISSED ANYTHING.
- SHOULDN'T LEGAL DEPARTMENT
DO THAT?

08:34.047 --> 08:35.649
BUT YOU'RE SO GREAT AT IT.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.618
AND GET IT DONE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.886
I WANT YOU FREE TO PROOF
MY PIECE ON BRUCE HENDRIE.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.889
WE ALREADY RAN
YOUR HENDRIE PIECE.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.591
NOT THAT ONE, A NEW ONE.
THE ONE I'M GONNA WRITE

08:44.625 --> 08:46.626
TOMORROW NIGHT AFTER
HIS CAMPAIGN KICKOFF PARTY.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.562
JUST GOT MY...
♪ PRESS PASS. ♪

08:49.596 --> 08:51.298
I'M SURE THERE ARE
GONNA BE SOME STORIES.

08:51.530 --> 08:54.668
THESE KICKOFF EVENTS
CAN GET PRETTY WILD.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.770
( laughs )
I STILL REMEMBER OBAMA'S.

08:57.803 --> 09:00.774
( whistles, laughs )

09:07.080 --> 09:10.549
IT WAS AMAZING.
EVERY SENTENCE,
EVERY WORD.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.985
AND THE STUFF THAT
HE'S SAYING ABOUT THE EFFECT

09:12.019 --> 09:14.053
OF CAPITALISM
ON MODERN ROMANCE--

09:14.086 --> 09:17.658
WOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU READ MY DAD'S BOOK
IN TWO DAYS.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.126
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVEN'T READ
THOMAS CARVER BEFORE NOW.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.028
I GUESS IT'S
MY OWN FAULT FOR...

09:22.062 --> 09:25.032
AVOIDING ANYTHING OTHER
PEOPLE TELL ME IS GOOD.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.868
ONE OF THESE DAYS I'LL LEARN
TO EMBRACE POP CULTURE.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.570
( sighs )
SPEAKING OF POP CULTURE.

09:34.006 --> 09:37.009
- FRIENDS OF YOURS?
- DO THEY LOOK LIKE
FRIENDS OF MINE?

09:37.043 --> 09:39.980
- THEY GO TO MY SCHOOL.
- BRENNA! ( chuckles )

09:40.013 --> 09:42.215
HEY, I'M GREER.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,

09:42.249 --> 09:43.951
BUT I'VE SENT YOU
LIKE A DOZEN EMAILS

09:43.984 --> 09:45.686
ON THAT HISTORY ASSIGNMENT
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO TOGETHER.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.989
YEAH, SORRY.
I HAVE A REALLY NARROW
SPAM FILTER.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.356
( laughs ) UH-HUH.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.926
WELL, SINCE YOU'RE HERE NOW,

09:52.960 --> 09:57.331
HOW ABOUT WE SET A TIME
SO WE DON'T ENCOUNTER ANY
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES?

09:57.364 --> 09:59.231
UMM, WANNA SAY...

09:59.265 --> 10:01.868
4:30-ISH TOMORROW?

10:01.902 --> 10:04.705
ALSO, LET'S MEET HERE.
OUR KITCHEN'S BEING RENOVATED,

10:04.738 --> 10:06.239
SO IT'S REALLY LOUD
AT MY PLACE.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.009
- FINE.
- GREAT.

10:10.876 --> 10:14.047
( mockingly )
OH MY GOD, DON'T YOU JUST
HATE KITCHEN RENOVATIONS?

10:14.081 --> 10:16.182

WELCOME TO PRIVATE SCHOOL.

10:16.216 --> 10:21.187
- AT LEAST SHE'S CUTE.
- DON'T GET ANY IDEAS.
SHE'S GAY.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.024
OH, NOW I'M GETTING A LOT
OF REALLY AWESOME IDEAS.

10:24.057 --> 10:27.226

- TAKING THE STAIRS.

10:46.245 --> 10:48.682
I DON'T NEED TO SPEND
THE NEXT 60 SECONDS
OF MY LIFE

10:48.715 --> 10:52.251

- NO, MY EDITOR WANTED ME TO.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.975
HE ASKED IF I WANTED TO WRITE
A PIECE ON THE FASHIONS

I MIGHT HAVE ONE,

13:24.904 --> 13:26.940
I KNOW

SO WHY ARE YOU HERE NOW?

13:30.943 --> 13:33.212
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:33.245 --> 13:35.248
I FELL ASLEEP

13:35.282 --> 13:36.982
AND ENDED UP
AT BRAINTREE STATION

13:37.017 --> 13:39.251
AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.988
I'VE BEEN SLEEPING
EIGHT HOURS A NIGHT.
I'M EATING NORMAL.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.456
AND YEAH, I'VE BEEN
WORKING REALLY HARD,

13:44.490 --> 13:46.493
BUT IT'S NOTHING
I HAVEN'T DEALT WITH BEFORE.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.261
STILL,
IT'S JUST LIKE-- LIKE--

13:49.296 --> 13:51.865
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE... SICK?

13:57.903 --> 14:01.307
YEAH, WELL,
SO HOW'D YOU GET HOME?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.043
SOMEBODY PICK YOU UP OR...

14:05.044 --> 14:07.047
FINALLY TELL YOUR MOM?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.982
OH NO, I DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL HER LIKE THAT.

14:10.015 --> 14:13.052
- WELL, I WISH
YOU'D CALLED ME.
- I TOOK A CAB.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.520
- I WAS FINE.
- ( chuckles )

14:14.553 --> 14:17.157
YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE TO LET
PEOPLE HELP YOU, DO YOU?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.359
I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

14:19.392 --> 14:21.927
SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD KNOW?

14:24.096 --> 14:26.131
( sighs )
MY GUMS STARTED BLEEDING.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.269
APRIL, YOU CAN'T LIE TO ME
ABOUT THIS STUFF ANYMORE.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.438
I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT WE'LL DO THE BIOPSY...

14:32.471 --> 14:36.375
TOMORROW, AND THAT'S
GONNA CHANGE EVERYTHING.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.077
WE'LL KNOW WHAT KIND
OF LEUKEMIA I HAVE

14:38.110 --> 14:40.080
AND JUST HOW BAD IT IS,
AND THEN...

14:40.113 --> 14:43.182
I CAN START TREATMENT,
RIGHT?

14:43.216 --> 14:44.951
RIGHT.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.889
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'M GOING TO WRITE YOU
A PRESCRIPTION

14:49.923 --> 14:52.024
FOR THREE DIFFERENT KINDS
OF ANTIBIOTICS

14:52.057 --> 14:53.493
TO PREVENT INFECTION.

14:53.525 --> 14:56.596
THE FATIGUE YOU'RE FEELING
IS THE RESULT OF ANEMIA,

14:56.629 --> 14:58.597
SO I'M GONNA ORDER
A C.B.C. FOR YOU,

14:58.631 --> 15:00.899
AND RIGHT NOW I WANT YOU
TO GET A BLOOD TRANSFUSION.

15:00.933 --> 15:03.937
- BLOOD TRANSFUSION?
- DON'T WORRY. IT'S NOT
AS SCARY AS IT SOUNDS,

15:03.970 --> 15:06.072
AND IT WILL HELP YOU
SIGNIFICANTLY.

15:07.039 --> 15:09.174
- OKAY.
- I'M GLAD YOU SEEM TO BE

15:09.208 --> 15:11.110
TAKING THESE THINGS
MORE SERIOUSLY.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.446
YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT WHAT YOU MAKE

15:13.480 --> 15:15.014
YOUR PRIORITIES,
YOU KNOW?

15:15.048 --> 15:17.484
YOU PUT THE WRONG THING
FIRST FOR TOO LONG,

15:17.517 --> 15:20.186
YOU WON'T JUST BE WAKING UP
AT THE WRONG TRAIN STOP.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.254
YOU'LL BE WAKING UP
IN THE WRONG LIFE.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.124
( chuckles )

15:24.157 --> 15:26.058
I FEEL
LIKE I ALREADY HAVE.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.697
( chattering )

15:33.198 --> 15:35.201
( people chattering )

15:40.407 --> 15:44.177
SERIOUSLY? I THOUGHT
I SCARED YOU OFF LAST TIME...

15:44.210 --> 15:46.679
BUT MAYBE I OVERESTIMATED
HOW INTIMIDATING I AM.

15:46.712 --> 15:49.048
- MAYBE I SHOULD
START HITTING THE GYM.
- IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.950
- PLEASE JUST LET ME
EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY I'M HERE.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:50.984 --> 15:53.219
HANG ON ONE SECOND.
EVERYONE! HI.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.221
QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT
BEFORE WE GET STARTED:

15:55.254 --> 15:58.625
THIS CHICK'S A REPORTER
AND SHE'S COVERING
MY DAD'S CAMPAIGN,

15:58.658 --> 16:00.994
SO DON'T SAY ANYTHING
YOU DON'T WANT BLASTED

16:01.027 --> 16:03.296
ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF "THE BOSTON POST."

16:03.330 --> 16:05.230
- ( murmuring )
- ( sighs )

16:05.264 --> 16:07.232
JUST--
JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.

16:10.102 --> 16:13.405
HI, MY NAME IS APRIL
AND HE'S RIGHT.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.142
I AM A REPORTER
AND I AM COVERING

16:16.176 --> 16:18.010
HIS DAD'S RUN
FOR OFFICE, BUT...

16:19.144 --> 16:22.081
I WAS ALSO DIAGNOSED
WITH LEUKEMIA.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.183
( murmuring continues )

16:24.216 --> 16:25.217
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.556
I FOUND OUT
ABOUT THIS PLACE
FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

16:29.588 --> 16:31.457
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE SICK.

16:33.259 --> 16:37.197
- BUT YOU ARE?
- I JUST HAD MY FIRST
BLOOD TRANSFUSION.

16:38.597 --> 16:40.600
( people chattering )

16:42.469 --> 16:46.105
WELL, THEN...
GRAB A SEAT.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.441
LOOKS LIKE
YOU JUST STARTED
THE MEETING.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.052
ME TOO.
YEAH YEAH YEAH.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.526
SO THAT WAS
PRETTY INTENSE.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.560
( sighs )
LEUKEMIA.

17:08.595 --> 17:11.297
UCK! I HEAR
IT'S PRETTY TOUGH TO TREAT.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.133
THANKS.
THAT'S HELPFUL.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.434
WELL, HEY, AT LEAST
YOU DON'T HAVE
A BRAIN TUMOR.

17:15.468 --> 17:19.138
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
COMPETING WITH ME ABOUT
WHOSE DIAGNOSIS IS WORSE?

17:19.172 --> 17:22.040
OH, GEAR IT DOWN.
I THOUGHT WE WERE
CANCER FRIENDS NOW...

17:22.075 --> 17:24.243
OR AT LEAST
UNTIL ONE OF US KICKS IT.

17:27.313 --> 17:30.250
OKAY, YOU KNOW HOW I PROMISED
TO TAKE OFF MY REPORTER CAP

17:30.282 --> 17:32.085
AS SOON AS I WALKED THROUGH
THE DOORS OF THIS PLACE?

17:32.117 --> 17:36.623
- YES.
- WELL, I TOTALLY INTEND
TO HONOR THAT PROMISE 100%.

17:36.655 --> 17:38.625
- BUT...
- YOUR DAD HAS

17:38.657 --> 17:40.826
A CAMPAIGN KICKOFF PARTY
TONIGHT AND I NEED A FAVOR

17:41.059 --> 17:42.729
FROM SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE
IN ORDER TO GET ON THE LIST.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.632
WELL, THAT IS DIRECT.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.101
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.134
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.369
YOU DO REALIZE THIS PARTY

17:50.403 --> 17:53.138
IS GONNA BE FULL
OF TOOLS IN MONKEY SUITS

17:53.173 --> 17:56.476
WHOSE HEADS ARE STUCK UP THEIR
SELF-IMPORTANT ASSES, RIGHT?

17:56.509 --> 18:00.346
YEAH, TOOLS IN MONKEY SUITS
WITH STORIES THAT COULD
GIVE ME A SCOOP.

18:01.815 --> 18:04.349

I'LL GET YOU IN.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.619
SERIOUSLY?
( laughs ) THANK YOU.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.087
- WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA.
- THANK YOU.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.423
YOU MADE ME FEEL
I JUST GRANTED

18:10.457 --> 18:12.258
YOUR MAKE-A-WISH WISH
OR SOMETHING.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.259
YOU TOTALLY DID.
YOU DID.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.729
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME

18:16.762 --> 18:18.664
AND MY CAREER.
I JUST-- I'M SO--

18:18.698 --> 18:21.401
I'M-- I HAVE TO
GO GET READY.
( laughs )

18:22.501 --> 18:24.237
HEY, CANCER FRIEND.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.239
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE...

18:27.240 --> 18:28.540
REALLY GREAT THOUGH?

18:30.876 --> 18:32.711
A BIG SCOOP.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.214
WHAT BIG SCOOP?

18:35.248 --> 18:37.517
THE STORY
OF A CANDIDATE'S SON

18:37.549 --> 18:40.220
WITH AN IMPENDING
EXPIRATION DATE--

18:40.252 --> 18:42.555
THAT IS IF YOU WANTED IT.

18:42.588 --> 18:44.691
YOU WOULD GIVE ME
YOUR STORY EXCLUSIVELY?

18:44.723 --> 18:46.291
FIND ME
AT THE PARTY.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.295
I ALREADY GRANTED
ONE WISH.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.597
I BELIEVE IT'S CUSTOMARY
TO GRANT THREE.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.304
( cellphone
plays tune, beeps )

18:58.337 --> 19:01.540
- WHAT'S UP?
- BRENNA, I NEED YOU
TO DO ME A HUGE FAVOR.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.643
I NEED YOU TO TAKE MOM
TO TANGO CLASS TONIGHT.

19:03.675 --> 19:06.778
( laughs )
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.382
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS.
SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO GO WITH BEN,

19:09.414 --> 19:11.750
AND SHE'S
REALLY SAD ABOUT IT.
SHE NEEDS A DATE,

19:11.784 --> 19:14.319
BUT I HAVE THE MOST INCREDIBLE
WORK THING THAT JUST CAME UP.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.556
- YOU ALWAYS HAVE
A WORK THING.
- I know,

19:16.588 --> 19:19.392
BUT THIS TIME
I'M BREAKING A HUGE STORY,

19:19.424 --> 19:21.361
AND REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT GIRL RAQUEL?

19:21.394 --> 19:22.761
I'M TOTALLY GONNA BE
KICKING HER ASS.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.763
COME ON,
HELP A SISTER OUT.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.366
I HAVE TO FINISH A PROJECT
WITH THIS GIRL FROM SCHOOL.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.269
MOM'S CLASS
DOESN'T START UNTIL 8:00.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.805
WHAT, YOU NEED MORE TIME
TO THINK OF OTHER EXCUSES?

19:32.838 --> 19:34.673
YEAH, JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND.

19:34.707 --> 19:38.877
- Brenn!
- OKAY, FINE.
I'LL DO IT.

19:38.912 --> 19:40.846
YOU'RE AWESOME.
THANK YOU.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.516
- MOM'S GONNA BE SO HAPPY.
- That makes one of us.

19:46.251 --> 19:48.253
- ( chattering )
- ( phones ringing )

19:51.190 --> 19:52.525
HERE ARE YOUR NOTES--

19:52.558 --> 19:54.826
CROSS-REFERENCED
AND ALPHABETIZED.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.630
WOW, YOU ARE...
AWFUL HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.632
SORRY,
I'M JUST EXCITED.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.300
I LOVE PARTIES.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.502
- PARTIES?
- OH YEAH, I SCORED AN INVITE

20:03.536 --> 20:05.438
TO HENDRIE'S CAMPAIGN
KICKOFF PARTY.

20:05.471 --> 20:08.307
- YOU MEAN A PRESS PASS.
- NO, AN ACTUAL INVITE.

20:08.340 --> 20:11.344
WELL! AND HOW EXACTLY
DID YOU MANAGE THAT?

20:11.376 --> 20:14.247
A GOOD REPORTER
NEVER REVEALS HER SOURCES.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.383
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING TONIGHT,
BY THE WAY?

20:18.951 --> 20:21.287
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T--
I WOULDN'T WANT US TO CLASH.

20:35.969 --> 20:37.002
SURPRISE!

20:37.236 --> 20:39.305
- ( bag rustles )
- ( drawer shuts )

20:39.338 --> 20:41.406
WHAT HAPPENED TO KNOCKING?

20:41.441 --> 20:43.308
SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO STARTLE YOU.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.509
I JUST WANTED
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.311
YOUR FAVORITE DRESS.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.780
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
BE FUN IF WE DRESSED UP
FOR TANGO TONIGHT.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.284
( sighs )
BRENNA DIDN'T TELL YOU.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.318
BRENNA DIDN'T
TELL ME WHAT?

20:54.319 --> 20:55.788
SHE'S TAKING YOU.
I CAN'T GO.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.523
- ( laughs ) YEAH.
- I'M SERIOUS.

20:58.557 --> 21:01.326
SHE HAS ALL THE DETAILS
AND SHE'S REALLY EXCITED.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.997
I'M SURE SHE'S NOT EXCITED,
BUT SHE'S SWEET TO DO IT.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.632
I'M SORRY
FOR THE LAST-MINUTE SWITCH,

21:05.664 --> 21:07.333
BUT I HAVE A HUGE
WORK THING TONIGHT,

21:07.366 --> 21:09.669
ACTUALLY, I TOTALLY NEED
THIS DRESS FOR.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.304
HOW'S IT LOOK?

21:14.406 --> 21:16.275
WOW.
HAVE YOU LOST WEIGHT?

21:16.308 --> 21:17.542
YOU'RE SWIMMING
IN THAT THING.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.311
IT IS A LITTLE BIG, HUH?

21:19.345 --> 21:20.779
YEAH, MAYBE I'LL
TAKE IT TO STELLA,

21:20.813 --> 21:22.048
SEE IF SHE CAN DO
A RUSH JOB.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.416
DO YOU HAVE
ANY SAFETY PINS?
OH, APRIL!

21:24.450 --> 21:26.986
- WHAT?
- WHAT HAPPENED?

21:27.019 --> 21:28.788
OH, UH, I, UM--

21:28.820 --> 21:31.391
I BUMPED INTO A SHELF
AT WORK THE OTHER DAY.

21:31.423 --> 21:33.792
I WAS WALKING WITH LAWRENCE,
AND HE WALKS SO FAST.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.595
I WASN'T LOOKING WHERE
I WAS GOING AND I JUST...

21:35.627 --> 21:37.296
- HONEY, THAT LOOKS PAINFUL.
- ...HIT THIS METAL THING.

21:37.329 --> 21:38.564
- DO YOU NEED SOME ICE?
- I'M FINE. NO, I'M FINE.

21:38.597 --> 21:40.298
I-- I REALLY SHOULD
START GETTING READY NOW.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.535
I'LL CALL BETH
AND SEE IF SHE CAN BRING ME
SOMETHING ELSE TO WEAR,

21:42.567 --> 21:45.471
BUT THANK YOU.
HAVE SO MUCH FUN AT TANGO.

21:45.505 --> 21:46.739
( chuckles nervously )

21:52.612 --> 21:54.747
( rock music playing )

21:54.780 --> 21:57.849
SO I THINK WE SHOULD
START OUR CALENDAR
ON THE YEAR 1347--

21:57.884 --> 21:59.519
THAT'S WHEN
THE OUTBREAKS STARTED--

21:59.551 --> 22:02.821
AND I THINK WE SHOULD
LEAD WITH THE TERM
"BLACK DEATH."

22:02.855 --> 22:04.957
- IT'S SO FREAKY, YOU KNOW?
- ( cellphone chimes )

22:05.958 --> 22:08.627
BRENNA? YOU WITH ME?

22:08.661 --> 22:10.596
YUP, "BLACK DEATH."

22:10.630 --> 22:12.898
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

22:12.932 --> 22:14.866
- YEAH, IT'S--
- ( cellphone chimes )

22:14.901 --> 22:17.703
- HANG ON.
- THIS IS TAKING TWICE AS LONG

22:17.737 --> 22:19.105
AS ME DOING
THE WHOLE PROJECT MYSELF.

22:19.337 --> 22:22.075
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN ME.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.876
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
YOU'RE JUST NOT EVEN
TRYING HERE.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.446
KINDA DEFEATS THE POINT
OF HAVING A PARTNER
FOR AN ASSIGNMENT.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.083
CHILL.
I'M READING IT NOW.

22:30.115 --> 22:31.116
( cellphone chimes )

22:32.384 --> 22:34.086
SERIOUSLY?

22:37.856 --> 22:39.692
SO, YOU PLAY TENNIS?

22:39.726 --> 22:42.461
- YEAH. WHY?
- I WAS JUST THINKING

22:42.494 --> 22:44.529
IF WORKING WITH ME
WAS SO DIFFICULT,

22:44.564 --> 22:47.432
HOW ABOUT WE BATTLE
THIS OUT ON THE COURT?

22:47.467 --> 22:50.702
LOSER HAS TO DO
THE PROJECT ALL BY HERSELF.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.872
DO YOU EVEN PLAY?

22:52.904 --> 22:55.474
I'VE HIT A BALL AROUND
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

22:55.508 --> 22:58.111
- HOW HARD COULD IT BE?
- I THINK WE SHOULD

22:58.144 --> 23:00.445
JUST DO OUR ASSIGNMENT
LIKE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.915
- ( cellphone chimes )
- FINE.

23:03.950 --> 23:07.452
( sighs )
OKAY, SCREW THAT.
YOU'RE ON.

23:09.454 --> 23:10.455
( knocks on door )

23:10.490 --> 23:12.090
( giggles )

23:12.125 --> 23:14.794
- OH. YES.
- SO WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT A BRUISE?

23:14.826 --> 23:17.630
- OH.
- OH, THAT LOOKS NASTY.

23:17.663 --> 23:20.398
IT DOESN'T HURT,
AND I'LL HAVE UNCLE GEORGE
TAKE A LOOK AT IT TOMORROW.

23:20.432 --> 23:22.501
RIGHT NOW I JUST NEED YOU
TO HELP ME HIDE IT.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.003
( pop music playing )

23:25.037 --> 23:26.506
( sighs )
THANK YOU.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.525
( chuckles )

24:21.861 --> 24:24.196
- THAT'S THE ONE.
- RIGHT?

24:24.230 --> 24:25.897
DOMINIC IS GOING
TO LOSE HIS MIND.

24:25.932 --> 24:28.099
ACTUALLY,
THAT'S THE GREAT THING--
HE'S NOT GONNA BE THERE.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.936
HOW IS DOMINIC NOT SEEING YOU
IN THIS GET-UP A GOOD THING?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.839
DOMINIC DOESN'T KNOW
I HAVE CANCER. LEO DOES.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.974
THE LAST THING I NEED
IS THEM MEETING

24:36.008 --> 24:38.778
- AND SHARING STORIES.
- YEAH, A GOOD CALL.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.212
STILL, THOUGH,
YOU'D BETTER WATCH IT.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.181
IN THAT DRESS,
EVEN I WANT TO JUMP YOU.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.482
( both laugh )

24:44.517 --> 24:46.586
( jazz music playing )

24:46.618 --> 24:49.221
- ( people chattering )
- ( cameras clicking )

25:10.076 --> 25:11.509
I GUESS
YOU FOUND YOUR IN.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.913
DOMINIC, YOU CAME.

25:14.946 --> 25:16.715
MY EDITOR INSISTED.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.718
APPARENTLY,
IT'S BREAKING NEWS THAT...

25:18.750 --> 25:20.252
HERRINGBONE IS
MAKING A COMEBACK.

25:21.519 --> 25:24.022
NOW THAT I SEE YOU'RE HERE,
I'M GLAD THAT IT IS.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.557
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.742
- I'M GONNA GET A DRINK.
- SURE. THERE'S A BAR
RIGHT HERE.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.177
- THIS ONE HAS A SHORTER LINE.
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
- FROM WHO?

25:46.211 --> 25:49.315
WELL WELL WELL,
WE MEET AGAIN.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.785
LEO. HI.
THIS IS DOMINIC.

25:53.952 --> 25:57.155
- BOYFRIEND?
- UM, NO. NO, CO-WORKER.

25:57.189 --> 26:00.992
- NICE TO MEET YOU, MAN.
- NICE TO MEET YOU TOO, DOM.

26:01.027 --> 26:03.729
SORRY.
CAN I CALL YOU "DOM"?

26:03.762 --> 26:05.964
JUST-- THOSE DIMPLES
MADE ME FEEL

26:05.998 --> 26:08.300
JUST SO IMMEDIATELY
COMFORTABLE WITH YOU.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.868
BAM!
THERE THEY ARE AGAIN.

26:10.936 --> 26:12.203
HOW DO YOU GUYS
KNOW EACH OTHER?

26:12.238 --> 26:15.907
WELL, LET'S SEE.
BRUCE HENDRIE'S MY FATHER,

26:15.942 --> 26:17.175
SO THAT'S HOW WE MET.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.944
AND THEN WE RAN
INTO EACH OTHER AGAIN--

26:18.978 --> 26:20.712
MAYBE SHE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT?

26:20.746 --> 26:22.748
NO. DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

26:22.781 --> 26:25.284
WELL, LET ME SAY

26:25.317 --> 26:28.220
IT WAS
AT THE WEIRDEST PLACE.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.691
THE HARDWARE STORE.

26:31.723 --> 26:34.660
YEAH, SHE WAS--
YEAH, SHE WAS BUYING A...

26:34.693 --> 26:36.628
CHAINSAW.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.163
DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.900
BUT IF I WERE YOU,
I'D START SLEEPING
WITH YOUR EYES OPEN.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.336
BUT IF YOU'RE
JUST "CO-WORKERS,"

26:43.368 --> 26:45.938
I GUESS YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT HOW
YOU'RE SLEEPING.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.606
LEO, WHEN DID YOU WANT
TO SIT DOWN AND DO THAT
INTERVIEW WE TALKED ABOUT?

26:49.240 --> 26:51.076
AFTER.
I PROMISE.

26:52.077 --> 26:53.813
NICE TO MEET YOU, DOM.

26:57.148 --> 26:59.184
YOU'RE INTERVIEWING
LEO HENDRIE.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.854
- IT WAS HIS IDEA.
- WOW.

27:01.886 --> 27:03.756
( mimicking )
"I'M APRIL CARVER.
I'M ADORABLE

27:03.788 --> 27:05.357
AND PEOPLE JUST THROW
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEWS AT ME.

27:05.391 --> 27:08.126
- I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TRY."
- SPOT ON IMPERSONATION.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.962
- WATER, PLEASE.
- SO WHAT'S YOUR ANGLE
GOING TO BE?

27:10.997 --> 27:12.131
YOU ARE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO WAIT

27:12.163 --> 27:14.133
FOR THE FRONT PAGE
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

27:14.165 --> 27:16.335
- Woman: AND FOR YOU, SIR?
- SCOTCH.

27:18.703 --> 27:20.705
( pop music playing )

27:25.277 --> 27:28.047
- I THOUGHT YOU PLAYED?
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

27:28.079 --> 27:30.682
HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T SUCK
THIS MUCH AT WRITING PAPERS,

27:30.715 --> 27:32.917
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING OURS.

27:32.951 --> 27:35.253
♪ HEY HEY,
HEY NA NA, HEY NA NA ♪

27:35.287 --> 27:37.189

27:40.226 --> 27:42.260
OKAY, NOW I'M JUST
FEELING BAD FOR YOU.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.230
YOU'RE NOT EVEN HOLDING
THE RACKET RIGHT.

27:44.262 --> 27:46.065
YOU WANT TO GRIP IT
UP AND DOWN LIKE THIS.

27:46.097 --> 27:47.932
WHATEVER.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT

27:47.967 --> 27:50.336
AND DON'T FEEL BAD FOR ME.
I'M JUST WARMING UP.

27:50.368 --> 27:55.007
OKAY. NO OFFENSE,
BUT I DO NOT SEE THIS
ENDING WELL FOR YOU.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.876
YEAH? WELL, THEN LET'S
RAISE THE STAKES.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.278
WHOEVER LOSES
HAS TO DO THE PAPER

28:00.311 --> 28:01.946
AND THE OTHER PERSON'S
HISTORY ASSIGNMENTS

28:01.980 --> 28:04.416
- FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

I REALLY HATE HISTORY.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.940
- ( jazz music playing )
- ( chattering )

28:27.972 --> 28:31.343
AND SO I SAID,
"WHO DO YOU THINK
I AM, THE BOSS?"

28:31.376 --> 28:34.380
- ( men laugh )
- GOOD, SIR.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.817
OH MAN, THAT GUY MUST
HAVE SUCH A WARPED SENSE
OF WHAT'S FUNNY.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.785
- THEY LAUGHED AT EVERY
SINGLE THING HE'S SAID.
- ( sighs )

28:39.818 --> 28:42.221
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO DO WHEN I FINALLY
GET TO TALK TO HIM.

28:42.253 --> 28:43.721
( cameras clicking )

28:46.357 --> 28:49.295
AND THAT'S WHAT
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO
RIGHT NOW WITH RAQUEL.

28:49.327 --> 28:51.297
- LET'S HEAR
YOUR FAKE LAUGH FIRST.
- ( mock laughs )

28:51.329 --> 28:54.165
- THAT'S HOW
YOU LAUGH AT MY JOKES.
- GOTTA GO.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.734
RAQUEL, HI.

28:56.769 --> 29:00.205
- I LOVE YOUR DRESS.
- LOVE YOURS TOO.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.508
I THINK I ALMOST
BOUGHT IT, ACTUALLY.

29:02.740 --> 29:05.111
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
IT WAS A REALLY LONG TIME AGO.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.746
APRIL, I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE MET SANYA BADAL,

29:07.779 --> 29:09.214
BRUCE HENDRIE'S
CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.282
HI, IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

29:11.317 --> 29:14.819
APRIL IS THE WRITER
WITH THE INVITATION
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.123
OH YES,
WHO INVITED YOU AGAIN?

29:17.155 --> 29:21.126
IT WAS LEO. HE'S GIVING ME
AN EXCLUSIVE, ACTUALLY.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.760
AN EXCLUSIVE?

29:23.796 --> 29:25.163
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

29:25.196 --> 29:27.066
I JUST SPOKE WITH HIM
FIVE MINUTES AGO

29:27.098 --> 29:28.433
AND HE DIDN'T
MENTION A THING.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.935
SEEMS LIKE
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
A MISCOMMUNICATION.

29:30.970 --> 29:34.306
- ( humphs )
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

29:34.339 --> 29:37.542
- ( microphone feedback )
- Leo: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

29:37.776 --> 29:40.179
CAN I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

29:40.211 --> 29:41.980
NOW IS THE POINT
IN THE EVENING

29:42.013 --> 29:43.449
WHERE WE BUM YOU OUT.

29:43.481 --> 29:46.451
NO, WE'RE NOT GONNA ASK
FOR DONATIONS...

29:46.484 --> 29:48.354
- YET.
- ( laughter )

29:48.386 --> 29:50.388
BUT SERIOUSLY,
I'D LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING

29:50.422 --> 29:53.893
THAT'S COME UP
SINCE MY DAD DECIDED
TO RUN FOR OFFICE

29:53.925 --> 29:55.493
A FEW WEEKS AGO--

29:55.528 --> 29:59.365
A LITTLE SOMETHING
ABOUT THE SIZE OF A WALNUT

29:59.397 --> 30:01.166
LODGED IN THE BACK
OF MY BRAIN.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.502
THAT LITTLE GUY
I'M TALKING ABOUT
MADE HIS DEBUT

30:04.537 --> 30:07.338
SIX YEARS AGO
AS A BENIGN TUMOR,

30:07.373 --> 30:10.375
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
HE'S DECIDED TO...

30:11.544 --> 30:13.345
MAKE A COMEBACK.

30:13.378 --> 30:15.480
I KNOW, I KNOW.
LIKE I SAID, BUMMER.

30:15.513 --> 30:18.349
BUT I TOTALLY SURVIVED IT
THE FIRST TIME.

30:18.384 --> 30:21.019
AND THE REAL REASON
I'M TELLING YOU ABOUT THIS NOW

30:21.053 --> 30:22.387
IS TO POINT OUT
THAT THE FIRST THING

30:22.421 --> 30:24.990
THAT MY DAD DID
WHEN HE LEARNED
ABOUT MY RELAPSE

30:25.023 --> 30:28.126
WAS ASK IF I WANTED HIM
TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE.

30:29.994 --> 30:33.832
AND MY DAD IS
ONE OF THOSE RARE MEN

30:33.865 --> 30:36.434
WHO HAVE
THEIR PRIORITIES IN ORDER.

30:36.468 --> 30:39.438
THAT'S WHY I TOLD HIM
THAT HE COULDN'T DROP OUT
OF THIS RACE.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.508
MASSACHUSETTS NEEDS
A GOVERNOR LIKE HIM.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.844
THE HONESTY...
AND CARE

30:45.877 --> 30:48.513
THAT MY FATHER,
BRUCE HENDRIE,

30:48.547 --> 30:50.348
HAS SHOWN ME

30:50.382 --> 30:52.884
IS THE SAME
CARE AND ATTENTION

30:52.917 --> 30:54.953
THAT THIS GREAT STATE NEEDS.

30:55.954 --> 30:58.190
( applause )

31:04.563 --> 31:08.433
OH NO. THAT WASN'T
YOUR BIG EXCLUSIVE, WAS IT?

31:17.442 --> 31:19.644
( angrily )
WHY DID YOU DO THAT TO ME?

31:19.877 --> 31:21.313
( humphs )
A LITTLE NARCISSISTIC,
ARE WE?

31:21.346 --> 31:23.582
- WHAT?
- WELL, LET'S SEE--

31:23.615 --> 31:25.517
I JUST TOLD A ROOM
FULL OF REPORTERS

31:25.550 --> 31:28.186
THAT I HAD
A BRAIN TUMOR AND YOU'RE
MAKING THIS ABOUT YOU.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.256
NO, I'M NOT. I JUST--
WHY WOULD YOU TELL ME

31:30.288 --> 31:32.657
I COULD BREAK THAT STORY
IF YOU WERE NEVER PLANNING
TO GIVE IT TO ME?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.893
YOU SHOWED UP
TO A CANCER SUPPORT MEETING

31:34.926 --> 31:36.628
LOOKING FOR AN INVITE
TO A PARTY.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.463
I WAS HOPING
THAT MY DOUBLE-CROSS

31:38.497 --> 31:39.999
MIGHT MAKE YOU RETHINK
YOUR PRIORITIES.

31:40.031 --> 31:42.500
BUT WHY GO OUT OF YOUR WAY
TO MANIPULATE ME LIKE THAT?

31:42.534 --> 31:44.670
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU KNOW THAT...

31:44.903 --> 31:47.905
- I'M SICK TOO.
- OH YEAH, KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.308
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING ABOUT YOU!

31:50.342 --> 31:52.443
IT'S NOT
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.546
WELL, IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT,
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN SICK
FOR VERY LONG.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.315
YOU'LL SEE.
LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S HARD TO HEAR,

31:56.347 --> 31:58.483
BUT THAT'S
THE BEAUTY OF BEING SICK--

31:58.517 --> 32:00.385
THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR ANYTHING BUT THE TRUTH.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.688
HERE'S SOME TRUTH:
YOU'RE AN ASS.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.589
WELL, I'M AN ASS
WITH A NEW BIKE

32:04.623 --> 32:08.394
THAT GOES ZERO
TO 60 IN 2.7 SECONDS,
SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.297
YEAH, YOU'VE REALLY GOT
YOUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT,

32:11.329 --> 32:13.265
LIVING IT UP
ON DADDY'S DIME!

32:13.298 --> 32:15.200
WHAT? YOU THINK
HE JUST GAVE IT TO ME?

32:15.233 --> 32:18.304
BRUCE HENDRIE
IS A BUSINESSMAN.
I HAD TO EARN IT.

32:18.336 --> 32:20.439
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:20.471 --> 32:23.241
"THE SAME HONESTY AND CARE

32:23.275 --> 32:27.145
THAT MY FATHER,
BRUCE HENDRIE, SHOWED ME

32:27.179 --> 32:29.515
IS THE EXACT SAME
CARE AND ATTENTION"--

32:29.548 --> 32:33.184
YOU GAVE THAT SPEECH
IN RETURN FOR A MOTORCYCLE?

32:33.218 --> 32:35.421
OOH...!

32:35.453 --> 32:37.155
NO COMMENT.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.427
( engine starts, revving )

32:50.602 --> 32:52.136
( groans )

32:52.171 --> 32:55.973
- ( tango music playing )
- ( chattering )

32:56.008 --> 32:59.177
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
PLEASE FIND YOUR PARTNER.

32:59.211 --> 33:00.645
WE'RE ABOUT TO BEGIN.

33:03.348 --> 33:05.351
( chattering )

33:08.987 --> 33:12.290
( beeps, rings )

33:12.324 --> 33:13.991
- ( beeps )
- Hey, it's Brenna.

33:14.026 --> 33:15.426
Leave a message.

33:16.662 --> 33:17.663
( chirps )

33:25.304 --> 33:27.405
MATCH POINT.
ONE POINT AWAY

33:27.439 --> 33:29.107
FROM NOT HAVING TO DO
HISTORY HOMEWORK

33:29.141 --> 33:31.477
- FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.
- ( laughs )

33:31.509 --> 33:33.578
WHY ARE
YOU LAUGHING, LOSER?

33:33.612 --> 33:35.247
DO YOU MIND
IF I CALL YOU "LOSER"?

33:35.279 --> 33:37.648
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE.
- I JUST GOT HUSTLED,

33:37.682 --> 33:40.318
DIDN'T I? ADMIT IT,
YOU'RE A HUSTLER.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.787
SORRY, NOT SORRY.

33:42.019 --> 33:44.757
HEY, THE GAME'S NOT OVER
TILL IT'S OVER.

33:44.789 --> 33:47.092
( chuckles )
IT'S OVER.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.064
- ( grunts ) OW.
- ( laughs )

33:52.096 --> 33:53.565
THAT WASN'T EVEN ON PURPOSE.

33:53.598 --> 33:58.470
JUST LUCK. AMAZING.

33:58.503 --> 34:00.506
WAIT, ARE YOU OKAY?

34:00.538 --> 34:02.473
( chuckles )
I DON'T KNOW.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.076
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE GONE FOR THAT SHOT.
I'M WAY TOO COMPETITIVE

34:05.109 --> 34:06.811
AND YOU'RE STILL SMILING.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.313
WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY
ALL THE TIME?

34:09.347 --> 34:10.782
WHAT?
BECAUSE I'M A LESBIAN,

34:10.815 --> 34:12.451
I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE ALL ANGRY LIKE YOU?

34:12.483 --> 34:15.153
- I DON'T KNOW.
- OH MY GOSH!

34:15.186 --> 34:18.123
- ARE YOU SMILING?
- YEAH.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.192
I'M IMITATING YOU.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.760
- ( laughs )
- HERE.

34:26.331 --> 34:27.733
( both laugh )

34:27.766 --> 34:31.269
- ( jazz music playing )
- ( people chattering )

34:31.302 --> 34:33.105
I DON'T GET
WHY HE LIED TO YOU.

34:33.137 --> 34:35.407
I DON'T GET
HOW I MESSED UP

34:35.440 --> 34:37.108
SUCH A HUGE BREAK...

34:37.141 --> 34:39.110
- AGAIN.
- IT WASN'T YOU.

34:39.143 --> 34:42.079
THE GUY SUCKS.
I DON'T CARE IF HE HAS CANCER.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.750
IT DOESN'T GIVE HIM THE RIGHT
TO JERK PEOPLE AROUND.

34:44.782 --> 34:47.686
MAYBE HE JUST DOESN'T CARE

34:47.719 --> 34:50.121
- ABOUT HURTING
PEOPLE ANYMORE.
- YOU THINK?

34:50.155 --> 34:53.125
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU GET SICK LIKE THAT?

34:53.157 --> 34:55.393
YOU JUST STOP CARING
ABOUT BEING A GOOD PERSON?

34:57.228 --> 35:00.431
- I HOPE NOT.
- WELL, I FEEL BAD
FOR HIS FAMILY.

35:00.465 --> 35:02.134
IF THIS IS WHAT HE'S LIKE
TO A COMPLETE STRANGER,

35:02.166 --> 35:03.668
IMAGINE WHAT
HE MUST BE LIKE AT HOME.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.838
I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD DEAL WITH THAT.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.610
- WITH-- WITH WHAT?
- ( sighs )

35:11.643 --> 35:13.177
JUST SOMEONE THAT SICK.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.483
MAYBE YOU'D FEEL DIFFERENTLY
IF YOU WERE CLOSE TO THEM.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.221
( sighs )
OKAY, THIS IS
JUST GETTING DEPRESSING.

35:25.190 --> 35:27.893
WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT
DECISION TO MAKE.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.695
WHAT STUPID '90s SITCOM
ARE WE GONNA PRETEND TO WATCH

35:30.728 --> 35:32.231
WHILE MAKING OUT
AT MY PLACE?

35:34.233 --> 35:35.766
ACTUALLY,
I'M JUST GONNA GO HOME.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.768
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE COMING OVER.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.137
I DIDN'T BRING
A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.173
WE'LL RAID GRAHAM'S CLOSET.
HE'S A VEGAN HIPSTER.

35:42.206 --> 35:43.876
I'M SURE HE WEARS
THE SAME SIZE PANTS AS YOU,

35:43.909 --> 35:46.911
- IF NOT SMALLER.
- NO, I HAVE TO BE
SOMEWHERE EARLY.

35:47.144 --> 35:48.213
OKAY.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.391
( cellphone chimes )

36:01.760 --> 36:03.427
( beeps )

36:08.300 --> 36:10.469
( sighs )
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

36:13.739 --> 36:14.873
( sighs )

36:17.208 --> 36:19.244
( April knocks )
BRENNA?

36:19.277 --> 36:20.545
BRENNA, OPEN UP!

36:22.280 --> 36:24.815
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I WAS SHOWERING.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.684
I JUST PLAYED TENNIS
FOR LIKE TWO HOURS.

36:26.717 --> 36:29.688
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
WITH MOM AT TANGO!

36:29.721 --> 36:32.490
- OH MY GOD.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME, BRENNA?!

36:32.523 --> 36:34.626
I'M SO SORRY.
I FORGOT.

36:34.659 --> 36:36.460
- DIDN'T SHE CALL YOU?
- I DON'T KNOW.

36:36.494 --> 36:38.230
- MY PHONE'S CHARGING.
YOU CAN GO LOOK.
- ( sighs )

36:38.262 --> 36:39.731
I CAN'T COUNT
ON YOU FOR ANYTHING.

36:39.764 --> 36:41.833
LOOK, THIS GIRL
AND I WERE WORKING
ON A HISTORY PROJECT,

36:41.867 --> 36:43.467
- AND WE HAD THIS BET--
- JUST STOP, OKAY?

36:43.501 --> 36:46.505
I CAN'T DEAL WITH ANY MORE
OF YOUR LAME EXCUSES.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.773
CHILL. I'LL GO TO THE STUPID
TANGO CLASS RIGHT NOW.

36:48.806 --> 36:51.643
JUST FORGET IT!
I'LL GO. I HANDLE
EVERYTHING ELSE ON MY OWN,

36:51.677 --> 36:54.278
- WHY NOT THIS TOO?
- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
A REAL BITCH LATELY.

36:54.313 --> 36:56.581
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A JOB
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOUR LIFE

36:56.614 --> 36:58.650
IS THAT MUCH HARDER
THAN ANYBODY ELSE'S.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.786
SORRY TO SAY IT,
BRENNA, BUT IT IS.

37:00.818 --> 37:03.322
OKAY, I'M WRONG.
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

37:03.355 --> 37:05.657
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT'S NEW?
I HAVE CANCER!

37:05.690 --> 37:08.260
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

37:08.293 --> 37:10.762
IT'S REALLY NOT.
BUT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,

37:10.795 --> 37:12.831
YOU CAN CALL UNCLE GEORGE
AND HE'LL TELL YOU!

37:12.864 --> 37:15.701
IN FACT, I'M GONNA GO
SEE HIM TOMORROW MORNING
FOR MY FIRST BIOPSY,

37:15.733 --> 37:18.737
SO HE CAN TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT
MY CHANCES ARE OF NOT DYING!

37:18.769 --> 37:20.338
( crying )

37:25.010 --> 37:27.478
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GONNA GO MAKE SURE

37:27.512 --> 37:29.981
MOM'S OKAY
AT HER STUPID TANGO CLASS.

FROM YOUR MOM.

38:47.059 --> 38:49.027
SHE LEFT ALREADY.

38:49.061 --> 38:50.762
BABY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

38:52.329 --> 38:53.764
IS THIS
ABOUT THE BIOPSY?

38:54.932 --> 38:56.367
I'LL CANCEL MY INTERVIEW.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.335
- I'LL COME WITH YOU.
- NO NO,

38:58.369 --> 39:00.771
YOU NEED A JOB,
AND I'LL BE FINE.

39:01.873 --> 39:03.340

39:04.775 --> 39:06.378
BRENNA KNOWS.

39:06.411 --> 39:07.612
OH.

39:07.646 --> 39:08.847
WE WERE IN A FIGHT

39:08.880 --> 39:10.882
AND IT JUST CAME OUT.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.717
( sighs )

39:12.751 --> 39:15.387
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I HAD
EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL,

39:15.420 --> 39:16.887
AND NOW I JUST FEEL LIKE

39:16.922 --> 39:19.056
I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING RIGHT.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.525
WE'RE BARELY INTO
THIS NEW CHAPTER
OF YOUR LIFE.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.427
IT'S BOUND TO BE
A BIT CONFUSING.

39:23.461 --> 39:26.530
- HOW ABOUT DEBILITATING?
- OF COURSE IT IS,

39:26.565 --> 39:27.898
BUT THERE IS
NO ONE MORE CAPABLE

39:27.932 --> 39:30.068
OF RISING
TO THE OCCASION THAN YOU.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.036
TRUST ME.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.940
I REALLY HOPE
YOU'RE RIGHT,

39:34.972 --> 39:37.641
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT...

39:37.675 --> 39:39.543
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT.

40:02.701 --> 40:05.704
HEY. GOOD MORNING, KIDDO.
HOW YOU DOING THIS MORNING?

40:06.737 --> 40:08.739
JUST READY
FOR THIS TO BE OVER.

40:08.773 --> 40:10.909
SO ARE WE WAITING
FOR ANYBODY?

40:10.942 --> 40:13.778
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I DIDN'T THINK

40:13.811 --> 40:15.914
YOU'D WANT TO GO
THROUGH THIS BY YOURSELF.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.615
I'LL BE FINE.

40:17.648 --> 40:20.719
OKAY.
LAY ON YOUR SIDE.

40:22.686 --> 40:24.088
AND PULL YOUR LEGS UP.

40:24.121 --> 40:25.757
( soft rock music playing )

40:27.125 --> 40:28.893
JUST GONNA NUMB THIS AREA

40:28.927 --> 40:31.829
WITH SOME LIDOCAINE FIRST.

40:32.963 --> 40:37.635
YOU MIGHT FEEL
A SLIGHT STING
AND BURN, OKAY?

40:42.474 --> 40:43.574
OKAY.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.010
OKAY.

40:47.913 --> 40:48.914

40:51.048 --> 40:52.617
AM I TOO LATE?

40:52.650 --> 40:53.918

YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME.

41:05.963 --> 41:08.032
YOU'RE GONNA
FEEL THIS NOW, OKAY?

41:10.902 --> 41:12.903
( breathing shakily )

41:15.539 --> 41:17.074
HERE WE GO.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.577
