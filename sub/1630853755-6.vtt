08:51.005 --> 08:53.176
Not a healer.

08:53.209 --> 08:55.647
I'm a worshipper.

08:56.683 --> 08:58.754
I worship the human form

08:58.787 --> 09:00.925

09:09.374 --> 09:12.147
If you want my help,

09:12.180 --> 09:13.918

09:13.951 --> 09:15.988

of being worshipped.

09:16.021 --> 09:18.025

09:19.629 --> 09:21.666
I'll be honest with you.

09:22.935 --> 09:24.806

09:33.155 --> 09:35.727
That is an honest answer.

09:42.808 --> 09:44.846
Follow me.

09:55.366 --> 09:57.972
The first thing you should do

09:58.005 --> 10:00.678
is toss all preconceived notion

10:00.711 --> 10:02.882

even look like the same people.

10:41.927 --> 10:43.797
PERLE:
In a way, they aren't.

10:43.830 --> 10:46.135
After visiting me,
these individuals experienced

10:46.168 --> 10:48.039
a profound change

10:48.072 --> 10:50.878
in their lives,
in their careers,

10:50.911 --> 10:53.216
in their relationships,

10:53.249 --> 10:55.286
their happiness.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.829
So what-what happens next?

decided what you look like.

11:08.045 --> 11:10.350
I'm just removing the graffiti.

11:10.383 --> 11:11.753
Remember?

11:16.095 --> 11:18.132
My compensation.

11:19.535 --> 11:21.740
Oh.

11:21.773 --> 11:23.142
You're getting a service
you can't get

11:23.175 --> 11:25.013
anywhere else in the world.

11:25.046 --> 11:27.250
That's worth something.

11:27.283 --> 11:29.321
Think it over.

11:36.368 --> 11:38.874
I really want this, Grady.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.178
We-we have to try
to make this work.

11:41.211 --> 11:43.316
GRADY: I've already run
the numbers twice, Virginia.

11:43.349 --> 11:46.255
I can't advise you to take on
this additional debt.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.459
I drive a Bentley.

11:48.493 --> 11:50.965
I have a mansion
in Beverly Hills.

11:50.998 --> 11:52.902
I can't be this broke.

11:52.935 --> 11:55.040
Yeah, if you want to keep
the Bentley and the mansion,

11:55.073 --> 11:57.010
then you'll continue
taking my advice.

11:57.043 --> 11:59.381
(sighs) Look, Virginia,
the simple fact is

11:59.414 --> 12:01.452
Bill left behind a lot of debt

12:01.485 --> 12:03.156
when he passed,
and a big chunk of that debt

12:03.189 --> 12:04.960
is in both of your names.

12:04.993 --> 12:06.997
And these creditors,
they-they have to be paid.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.534
Okay.

12:08.567 --> 12:10.805
What the hell?
I can cut back.

12:10.838 --> 12:13.176
Sell the Bentley.
I can drive a Mercedes.

12:13.209 --> 12:15.548
It's not that simple, Virginia.

12:15.581 --> 12:17.785
Well.
(chuckles)

12:17.818 --> 12:20.256
Maybe I just need...

12:20.289 --> 12:22.829
another business manager.

12:22.862 --> 12:25.568
Any other business manager

12:25.601 --> 12:28.507
would've already
made you sell everything

12:28.540 --> 12:30.276
and move to Sylmar.

12:30.309 --> 12:32.114
Will you be smart
and stop with the threats?

12:32.147 --> 12:34.151
Okay? You can't
afford this, Virginia.

called and he...

in debt you are.

-No. No, no.

to pay tuition.
-No, no, no, no.

can we please not overreact.

18:20.476 --> 18:22.213

20:44.097 --> 20:45.066
In high school.

20:45.099 --> 20:47.538
I wanted one of those...

20:47.571 --> 20:50.476
side shaves to be oh-so-cool
and feminist.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.915
And Daddy and my bio mom...

20:52.948 --> 20:54.017
(chuckles softly)

20:54.050 --> 20:55.521
Mm.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.525
...said no way,
but I did it anyway.

20:57.558 --> 21:00.062
They freaked out. They took away
my phone and my computer

21:00.095 --> 21:01.599
until it grew back.

21:01.632 --> 21:02.868
It was a long time.

21:02.901 --> 21:04.739
-Ah.
-I was so mad. I just

21:04.772 --> 21:06.341
trashed my bedroom.

21:06.374 --> 21:08.012
Even this heirloom necklace

21:08.045 --> 21:09.682
my mom had given me, passed on

21:09.715 --> 21:10.951
from my grandmother.

21:10.984 --> 21:12.353
VIRGINIA:
I-I didn't know

21:12.386 --> 21:13.924
that happened.

21:13.957 --> 21:15.426
We all have things we want,

21:15.459 --> 21:16.663
and sometimes
they seem so important

21:16.696 --> 21:19.434
that we do things we shouldn't.

21:19.467 --> 21:20.938
Well, I gue...

21:20.971 --> 21:22.908
I guess that's true.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.383
What I'm trying to say is
I-I don't...

21:27.416 --> 21:28.953
I don't know
what you're going through.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.326
But I shouldn't--
I shouldn't judge.

21:33.061 --> 21:35.366
I meant what I said.

21:35.399 --> 21:38.038
You've never made me feel
like a stepdaughter.

21:38.071 --> 21:39.675
Good.

21:39.708 --> 21:42.413
So, I want to help.

21:42.446 --> 21:43.650
Okay.

21:43.683 --> 21:45.085
Good.

21:46.121 --> 21:47.557
Mm.

21:49.762 --> 21:51.932
I do have one question though.

21:52.901 --> 21:54.437
Wh-What's that?

21:54.470 --> 21:56.108
This, this procedure
that you got...

21:56.141 --> 21:57.376
Mm.

21:58.178 --> 22:00.082
...what exactly is it?

22:01.051 --> 22:04.090
That's a weird question to ask.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.629
It-It's a facelift.

22:07.598 --> 22:09.936
Okay. Just...

22:09.969 --> 22:11.839
These bandages,
they seem a little,

22:11.872 --> 22:13.877
like... (stammers)
They just seem

22:13.910 --> 22:15.446
-a little thick.
-Well, she said

22:15.479 --> 22:17.083
there'd be swelling.

22:17.116 --> 22:18.954
Okay, well, okay,
I'm not a nurse

22:18.987 --> 22:20.824
and I promised myself
I'd just be supportive.

22:20.857 --> 22:22.595
-(sighs)
-So as long as you're talking
to your doctor

22:22.628 --> 22:24.096
-and she says everything's okay,
what do I know?
-(sighs)

22:27.871 --> 22:28.840
PERLE:
Let me know

22:28.873 --> 22:30.911
if you feel any pressure.

22:30.944 --> 22:32.781
VIRGINIA:
Why can't doctors
use the word "pain"?

22:32.814 --> 22:35.988
Oh! I felt some... pressure
right there.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.056
Sorry.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.495
-Um...
-(grunts softly)

22:39.528 --> 22:41.899
-What about what my daughter
was saying?
-Uh, well,

22:41.932 --> 22:43.135
you already know
the answer to that.

22:43.168 --> 22:44.437
-You said it yourself.
-(grunts)

22:44.470 --> 22:45.507
A procedure like this

22:45.540 --> 22:47.778
causes trauma to the tissues.

22:47.811 --> 22:49.649
There's always going to be
some swelling.

22:49.682 --> 22:51.786
But good news--

22:51.819 --> 22:53.623
it's already coming down.

22:53.656 --> 22:56.461
How long
do I have to wear these?

22:56.495 --> 22:58.600
It's very hard
not to be able to use my hands.

22:58.633 --> 23:01.739
I think the bandages
will come off in a...

23:01.772 --> 23:04.477
-day or so.
-(grunts)

23:04.511 --> 23:07.818
You know, it feels like you did
more than work on the skin.

23:07.851 --> 23:10.557
The-the bones
actually feel different.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.128
I don't just work on the skin.

23:13.161 --> 23:15.032
I work on the whole you.

23:15.065 --> 23:17.805
These sensations you're feeling
are just the healing process.

23:17.838 --> 23:20.744
Your nerves are interpreting
signals in the wrong way.

23:20.777 --> 23:22.681
There's nothing to worry about.

23:22.714 --> 23:24.017
All right, all done.

23:24.050 --> 23:25.520
(grunts)

23:26.922 --> 23:28.927
(groaning softly)

23:28.960 --> 23:32.100
Your recovery is
a tad slower than I'd hoped,

23:32.133 --> 23:33.503
but it's on track.

23:33.536 --> 23:35.907
So, I'm very pleased.

23:38.746 --> 23:40.851
Can I be frank with you,
Virginia?

23:40.884 --> 23:42.053
Please.

23:42.086 --> 23:44.057
I don't think your daughter

23:44.090 --> 23:47.498
is a very positive force
in this recovery process.

23:47.531 --> 23:49.167
I know she's being very helpful
to you,

23:49.200 --> 23:51.506
but any experienced physician
will tell you

23:51.539 --> 23:53.042
that, for the healing process,

23:53.075 --> 23:55.814
state of mind is as important
as anything else.

23:55.847 --> 23:57.183
And she's affecting yours.

23:57.216 --> 23:59.655
Fay has her problems with this,

23:59.688 --> 24:01.190
but I need her help.

24:03.563 --> 24:05.534
What if I were to tell you

24:05.567 --> 24:07.538
that there is a place
where you can go

24:07.571 --> 24:09.842
where all your needs
will be taken care of

24:09.875 --> 24:12.280
and you'll be surrounded
by supportive people

24:12.313 --> 24:14.819
who want nothing
but the best for you?

24:14.852 --> 24:17.123
This exists?

24:17.156 --> 24:18.860
(chuckles softly)

24:18.893 --> 24:21.264
I have a small retreat
in the Santa Monica Mountains.

24:21.297 --> 24:22.935
This weekend, I'm having

24:22.968 --> 24:25.072
a small gathering
of patients and colleagues.

24:25.105 --> 24:26.876
And I'd like you to join us.

24:26.909 --> 24:30.015
My staff is medically trained
and will tend to all your needs.

24:30.048 --> 24:32.721
And this will coincide with
the removal of your bandages,

24:32.754 --> 24:34.224
which I can do up there.

24:34.257 --> 24:36.896
Uh, sounds like heaven.

24:36.929 --> 24:38.165
But I can't

24:38.198 --> 24:40.236
-be doing...
-This is complimentary

24:40.269 --> 24:41.773
for all my patients.

24:41.806 --> 24:42.841
Oh.

24:44.945 --> 24:46.716
(sighs)

24:46.749 --> 24:48.185
I don't like
not knowing where you are.

24:48.218 --> 24:50.724
Well, she likes to keep
the location a secret.

24:50.757 --> 24:53.295
I would think you'd be happy
having me out of your hair.

24:53.328 --> 24:55.166

-(bag zipping)

24:55.199 --> 24:56.668

25:02.012 --> 25:03.583
I don't trust this doctor, Mom.

25:03.616 --> 25:05.186
I did some searches
in the legal database at school,

25:05.219 --> 25:07.591

of her having a medical degree,

25:07.624 --> 25:08.993
at least
not in the United States.

25:09.026 --> 25:10.664
She has a certificate
of medical science--

25:10.697 --> 25:12.601
whatever that is--
and it's from some school

25:12.634 --> 25:14.805
that I've never heard of in
some country I can't pronounce.

25:14.838 --> 25:16.742
What happened
to you being supportive?

25:16.775 --> 25:18.613
This is me being supportive,
Mom.

25:18.646 --> 25:20.316
She has three malpractice suits
from Oregon and Washington,

25:20.349 --> 25:22.320
all of which vanished before
she moved to Beverly Hills

25:22.353 --> 25:24.190
and set up her firm.
This woman is shady, Mom.
