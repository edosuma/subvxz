09:55.564 --> 09:58.697
I'm gonna train you so you don't

that ADD of yours

for me, huh?

10:13.419 --> 10:14.851
About what?

10:14.953 --> 10:16.289
Well, he's got access
to town and I need

10:16.391 --> 10:17.620
to get my hands on a phone.

10:17.722 --> 10:18.986
So you go talk to him.

10:19.088 --> 10:21.591
Hey, I need you
to vouch for me.

10:21.693 --> 10:22.990
What's your deal, dude?

10:23.092 --> 10:24.557
This place is
like a summer camp,

to hustle your way out of it.

a couple guys

26:30.356 --> 26:31.626

were out taking

26:31.728 --> 26:32.759
a little walk last night.

26:32.862 --> 26:34.359
And that road?
That road is

26:34.461 --> 26:36.659
a common drop-off place
for contraband.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.365
So we decided to check
your lockers this morning.

Didn't find anything, but
then we searched the kitchen.

26:42.210 --> 26:43.767

people like to store things
in the dry rice and the beans.

26:46.206 --> 26:47.704
It's not mine.
You sure?

26:47.806 --> 26:50.273
'Cause I saw you talking to MVP,
who does their deliveries.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.580
I was conversing.
I talk a lot.

26:52.682 --> 26:53.850
You can't have a phone.

is personal, though,

Okay, talk.

I robbed a man at gunpoint.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.467
The owner of a liquor store.

27:16.569 --> 27:18.402
He got up at my parole hearing
and he read a letter

27:18.504 --> 27:20.003

and he hoped I could

27:20.105 --> 27:21.606

27:24.846 --> 27:26.647
I don't deserve that.

27:27.449 --> 27:30.151
But I have to believe that
he knows something that I don't.

And that if I work this program,
that I can succeed.

27:32.793 --> 27:34.721

(cheering continues)

41:37.498 --> 41:38.431
Ugh.

41:38.533 --> 41:39.828
How are you?

41:39.930 --> 41:40.930
Uh, I'm fine.

41:41.032 --> 41:42.132
I heard
one of the guys

41:42.234 --> 41:43.475
from the con crew
helped you out,

41:43.577 --> 41:45.102
so I wanted to thank him.
Do you know...

41:45.205 --> 41:46.969
Where's Vince?
Is he here with you?

41:47.071 --> 41:48.812
He's on his way. Why?

41:48.914 --> 41:51.080

41:51.182 --> 41:52.782
(sighs)

41:54.011 --> 41:56.049
Sharon, he's back.

41:58.519 --> 42:01.150
There's a bus outside waiting
to take you back to Lompoc.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.254
Let's go.
Manny, give us the room.

42:03.356 --> 42:05.329
MANNY:
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can't do that.

42:05.431 --> 42:06.859
This is my inmate. I technically

42:06.961 --> 42:08.891
can't leave him...
Give us the room.

42:08.993 --> 42:10.667
Is everything okay?

42:10.769 --> 42:12.829
I'll take full
responsibility for him,

42:12.931 --> 42:15.233
just... please?

42:16.901 --> 42:18.368
