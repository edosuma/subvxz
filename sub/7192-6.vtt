00:07.924 --> 00:09.968
- Hey yourself.

00:10.051 --> 00:11.928
- Who are you and what are you
doing in my kitchen?

00:12.011 --> 00:14.180
- You like cake?
We made a bunch--

00:14.264 --> 00:16.933
chocolate, double chocolate,
triple chocolate, vanilla.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.393

00:24.983 --> 00:26.651
- Quintuplets?
Don't you mean clones?

00:26.735 --> 00:28.278
- You told her?

00:28.361 --> 00:30.613
- Well, yes,
because she's your...

00:30.697 --> 00:33.450
- I'm Jessie.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.201
Jessie, your sister.

00:35.285 --> 00:38.496
- [scoffs]
Okay, sure.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.289
You guys bought that?

00:39.372 --> 00:41.207
- She was really convincing.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.377
I mean, she already knew
about magic and everything.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.503
She really could be our--

00:45.587 --> 00:47.505
- Yeah!

00:47.589 --> 00:48.173
That's what I'm talking about!

00:48.256 --> 00:49.924
Teach me to do that.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.968
- Was pretty impressive,
wasn't it?

00:52.051 --> 00:54.971
No! No, I'm not
going to teach you

00:55.054 --> 00:56.598
because you're not
my sister.

00:56.681 --> 00:57.640
- Yes, I am.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.476
Is this some kind
of practical joke?

00:59.559 --> 01:02.020
Are there cameras
around here

01:02.103 --> 01:03.146
because--

01:03.229 --> 01:04.230
because I'm not
falling for it!

01:04.313 --> 01:06.983
- Why can't you just
believe this?

01:07.066 --> 01:09.360
I believed it when
I found out about you.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.069
- [sighs]

01:13.406 --> 01:14.240
- Whoa, cool!

01:14.324 --> 01:14.657
Can you teach me
this, too?

01:14.741 --> 01:16.284
- No.

01:17.827 --> 01:18.703
- Do it again.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.371
This time make me fly.

And don't come back,

01:25.251 --> 01:27.837
or I'll turn you
into a caterpillar.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.130
Not a cute one either.

proving anything,

03:00.305 --> 03:01.306
so you better have
something else.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.688

how I missed you.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.732

03:30.668 --> 03:32.295
- Gigi, you didn't see
what you think you saw.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.465
- I'm pretty sure I did.
How did you--

03:35.548 --> 03:36.966

so now I have--

03:37.050 --> 03:37.967
- No!

03:38.051 --> 03:39.802
- Proxy,
she'll be fine.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.888
- No, but you already wiped
her memory once today.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.057
Can't twice in one day
do permanent damage?

03:44.140 --> 03:45.308
- We can't just
let it go, though.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.517
She'll tell everyone.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.686
- I'd love to have
my memory wiped.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.272
It would be like
being brand-new again.

03:51.356 --> 03:51.981

to wipe her mind.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.577
otherwise she'll post this
to Miss Information.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.663
- But it's not worth
frying her brain over.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.039
- You guys...

04:08.122 --> 04:09.165
- Emma said
it wasn't dangerous

04:09.248 --> 04:10.792
unless two witches
do it at the same time.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.418
- Okay, but she doesn't
know that for sure.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.920
Yes, Emma's
a powerful witch,

04:14.003 --> 04:15.213
but she doesn't
know everything.

to find her first.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.848
- No!
Where'd she go?

04:25.932 --> 04:27.141
- She couldn't
have gone far.

04:27.225 --> 04:27.392
- Quick!
Find her.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.695
- Take a good look.

- Jeans!

of jeans is missing.

I, um, I saw them last
in--in here.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.222
- You lost your jeans?
- Mm-hmm.

05:06.305 --> 05:07.724
- Inside a restaurant?
- Mm-hmm.

05:07.807 --> 05:08.683
- You don't even wear jeans.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.727
Ever.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.687
- Well, I would,
if I could find them.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.358
What was that for?

05:17.442 --> 05:18.609
- I don't want Emma
to know

05:18.693 --> 05:20.570
I let Gigi
see me do magic.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.572
What if she tells
the Council?

05:22.655 --> 05:24.866
They'll take away my Liberator
of the Council title.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.328
- Whoa, dude, I said that you
could stay over, not him.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.414
- But where's he
gonna stay?

05:31.497 --> 05:32.874
- He can stay with me.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.876
I'm not a Fraidy
McScaredy-Cat.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.669
I'm not afraid, okay?

05:36.753 --> 05:39.172
It's... Gigi.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.506
She has snake-aphobia.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.632
- We should go.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.592
I wanna check Hex again.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.219
Plus, they seem
really preoccupied

05:45.303 --> 05:48.014
looking for those...
jeans.

05:48.097 --> 05:49.057
- Hand Billy over.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.516
I'll take really
good care of him.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.603
- All right, he's super
easy to take care of.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.730
He likes to sleep
in a warm place,

05:55.813 --> 05:57.273
but don't worry
about it too much.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.442
If he gets cold he'll just
crawl in bed with you.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.069
But don't let him
wrap around you.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.904
He's just playing
but sometimes

06:02.987 --> 06:05.865
he doesn't know
his own strength and...

06:07.658 --> 06:09.160
- I got it.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.496
You're cute, but
no funny business.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.631
- Gigi, wait!

06:21.714 --> 06:23.341
- No! No!

06:25.718 --> 06:26.761
- I can't!

06:26.844 --> 06:29.305
- Maddie's a witch,
and so is Emma?!

06:29.388 --> 06:31.307
Miss Information is gonna
get so many hits.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.308
- No!

06:32.391 --> 06:33.184
No, why don't we
talk about this,

06:33.267 --> 06:35.144
you know,
girl to girl?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.187
- No way!

06:36.270 --> 06:38.773
You said you wanted to
wipe my memory,

06:38.856 --> 06:41.317
but I need my memory
so I can blog about this.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.027
This won't take
all my power,

06:43.111 --> 06:44.445
just forget
the last half-hour.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.954
- Daniel...

06:53.037 --> 06:54.205
Hi.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.291
When did you get here?

06:57.375 --> 06:58.543
- I don't know.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.961
- There.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.087
Everything's back to normal.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.171
- No, it's not.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.840
You wiped Daniel's
memory, too.

07:03.923 --> 07:04.924
- And we're supposed to be
helping him remember stuff,

07:05.007 --> 07:07.009
not forget.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.303
- Oh, yeah.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.013
I'll just reverse it.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.349
Looks like I really
blew it... [chuckles]

07:13.432 --> 07:14.809
but that's okay,
I'll just undo it.

07:16.435 --> 07:19.522

and I'm telling everybody!

07:19.605 --> 07:20.857
- Oh, no!

07:22.942 --> 07:24.193
- Oh.

07:24.277 --> 07:24.485
Hi, Daniel.

07:27.446 --> 07:30.867
- [groaning]
I'm hungry.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.326
Where's Junior?

07:32.410 --> 07:33.619
- No food until I hear
the whole story.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.455
- But I explain better
on a full stomach.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.833
- Fine.
What would you like?

07:40.835 --> 07:42.211
Mac and cheese?

07:42.295 --> 07:45.089
Pizza?
Or waffles?

07:45.173 --> 07:46.674
- How did you do that?

07:46.757 --> 07:49.802
Is it like a switch
that turns on the magic,

07:49.886 --> 07:52.013
or a magic word
or something?

07:52.096 --> 07:53.806
- It's not like that,
it's a...

07:53.890 --> 07:55.308
Wait, why am I
telling you?

07:55.391 --> 07:56.309
You're not a witch.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.059
- I am too a witch.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.312
I'm your sister,

07:59.395 --> 08:02.064
so I'm a witch
if you're a witch.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.900
- Wizard, okay?

08:03.983 --> 08:05.943
And even if you
<i>are</i> my sister,

08:06.027 --> 08:07.278
it doesn't mean
you're a witch.

08:07.361 --> 08:08.571
Mom was a human,
so that only means

08:08.654 --> 08:11.532
you have a 50% chance
of being a witch.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.742
- Wait, what?

08:12.825 --> 08:14.285
- I'll ask the questions here.

08:14.368 --> 08:17.830
You've got your dinner.

08:17.914 --> 08:18.789
Now talk up.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.127

is your father--

and Mom died
ten years ago.

There's only been one other
break in recorded history,

I mean,
nice to meet you!

20:17.049 --> 20:18.383

in a foster home when Mom died

with Dad and I

20:22.221 --> 20:24.973
