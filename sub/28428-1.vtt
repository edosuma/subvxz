WEBVTT

00:54.859 --> 00:57.425
I love you, Mary.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.358
All of you.

01:43.458 --> 01:45.026
- Ms. Darcy.
- Where is my mother?

01:45.159 --> 01:47.458
I have to warn you this
can be rather shocking.

01:47.592 --> 01:49.026
I found my father
hanging from a meat hook

01:49.159 --> 01:50.559
when I was 12 years old.

01:50.692 --> 01:52.392
I think, I can handle this.

03:19.325 --> 03:21.159
Bloody hell, are you
sure he's even home?

03:21.293 --> 03:22.959
He said he'd be here.

03:28.492 --> 03:29.659
Hello?

04:02.425 --> 04:05.392
Christopher, this is Jane Darcy.

04:06.293 --> 04:08.059
So this is where my mother died.

04:08.992 --> 04:11.059
Christopher found
your mother out back.

04:12.725 --> 04:13.559
Show me.

04:42.059 --> 04:43.859
I was woken by her,

04:45.293 --> 04:47.792
her screams and babbling.

04:50.559 --> 04:53.725
By the time I got
down here, Emma was...

05:05.592 --> 05:08.759
It's getting cold,
can we go inside?

05:10.759 --> 05:11.625
Yeah.

05:13.358 --> 05:15.293
I gotta get back to the station.

05:15.425 --> 05:17.092
Night, Ms. Darcy.

05:53.392 --> 05:55.725
It's remarkable...

05:57.492 --> 06:00.625
how daughters resemble
their mothers.

06:02.592 --> 06:04.792
Show me where my
mother's things are.

06:11.759 --> 06:13.159
Are you sure there isn't a hotel

06:13.293 --> 06:14.892
in Greenvale I could stay in?

06:15.126 --> 06:16.792
No, you'll be fine here.

06:21.325 --> 06:23.659
This actually was her room...

06:24.759 --> 06:26.458
when she was a little girl.

07:29.392 --> 07:30.725
Fuck's sake.

07:43.259 --> 07:44.625
Ow!

07:44.759 --> 07:46.126
Fuck!

07:46.259 --> 07:47.193
Are you all right?

07:47.325 --> 07:48.892
What the fuck is wrong with you?

07:56.092 --> 07:58.026
You're just leaving
me like this?

08:07.059 --> 08:09.392
She's
a bit of a bitch.

08:12.226 --> 08:13.092
What?

08:14.226 --> 08:17.392
That's what your
loving mom said about you.

08:18.625 --> 08:20.092
And how right she was.

08:20.226 --> 08:21.959
Why would you say that?

08:24.559 --> 08:25.659
Piss off.

08:27.092 --> 08:27.959
Piss off!

09:43.659 --> 09:44.859
- Jane?
- Go!

09:46.193 --> 09:48.325
Please open the door.

09:48.458 --> 09:49.992
I'm sorry.

09:50.126 --> 09:51.259
Go away.

09:51.392 --> 09:54.525
It's just the blood, and...

09:55.559 --> 09:57.392
And what?

09:58.992 --> 10:00.293
Here look.

10:00.425 --> 10:01.559
Look, look.

10:06.159 --> 10:07.826
Suit yourself then.

10:16.059 --> 10:18.059
Thank you.

10:21.559 --> 10:22.659
Thank you.

10:34.126 --> 10:34.959
Okay.

10:44.026 --> 10:48.692
I just wish I
could've been there with her.

10:53.458 --> 10:54.959
Just rest it there.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.026
It's okay.

11:10.325 --> 11:11.559
What's this?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.525
Found it in Mom's suitcase.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.926
Suppose she was planning
one last painting.

11:29.193 --> 11:30.059
Caliban.

11:41.692 --> 11:43.625
So this is my homework.

11:43.759 --> 11:44.659
Yep.

11:47.559 --> 11:50.759
While my mother rots,
I'm filing out forms.

11:54.092 --> 11:56.592
Better get this
over and done this.

11:56.725 --> 11:59.559
The sooner I get out of
Greenvale the better.

11:59.692 --> 12:01.725
You'll be out of
here soon enough,

12:02.659 --> 12:03.826
what about the fee?

12:05.992 --> 12:07.059
How much is it?

12:07.193 --> 12:08.959
About $3,000.

12:12.159 --> 12:12.992
Fuck.

12:18.325 --> 12:20.525
Thanks, Mom, for bankrupting me.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.826
I'm going to bury her here.

12:33.959 --> 12:34.959
In Greenvale?

12:35.725 --> 12:36.959
This was her home.

12:37.092 --> 12:38.659
This should be
her resting place.

12:38.992 --> 12:42.792
Well, Christopher takes care
of all of those arrangements.

12:44.325 --> 12:46.392
Christopher's a
bit off, isn't he?

12:47.492 --> 12:50.559
You know, with the
dark house, no mirrors.

12:50.692 --> 12:52.226
Although if I looked like that,

12:52.358 --> 12:54.892
I certainly wouldn't want to
see my reflection everyday.

12:55.026 --> 12:57.325
And the weird little,
sort of, doll things.

12:57.458 --> 12:58.226
Figurines.

12:58.358 --> 12:59.392
Figurines.

13:00.358 --> 13:02.325
We all have our
quirks, Ms. Darcy.

13:03.358 --> 13:05.392
Christopher and I
practically grew up together.

13:05.525 --> 13:06.625
He's like my brother.

13:07.092 --> 13:08.859
Somehow that
doesn't surprise me.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.659
So do you wanna go
see him or what?

13:12.892 --> 13:15.193
It seems I don't have much
of a choice, doesn't it?

13:15.826 --> 13:17.625
So check it out, Christopher.

13:17.759 --> 13:19.592
The parade is gonna be at noon.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.659
And guess who the
turkey's gonna be?

13:23.725 --> 13:27.293
M.C., he's gonna
make all those girls

13:27.425 --> 13:28.959
gobble, gobble, gobble.

13:32.026 --> 13:35.159
At 2:00 we got the
pumpkin pie eating contest,

13:35.293 --> 13:36.592
the one you like a lot.

13:41.026 --> 13:41.926
What's wrong?

13:43.193 --> 13:44.892
No, it sounds great, yeah.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.026
Thanks.

13:47.592 --> 13:49.059
Okay, so check this one out.

13:49.193 --> 13:52.425
Marge was pretending to
be Pocahontas this year,

13:52.559 --> 13:53.959
and when I told her
that she wasn't,

13:54.092 --> 13:57.392
dude, she was pissed
to the bone, bro.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.325
Hold up.

14:06.159 --> 14:07.492
Hello there.

14:08.193 --> 14:09.926
Is Christopher here?

14:10.092 --> 14:14.892
Oh, is this
official business?

14:16.026 --> 14:17.392
Cut the crap.

14:21.159 --> 14:22.059
Fuck.

14:29.092 --> 14:30.392
Never mind me.

14:31.293 --> 14:35.659
How's the repatriation coming?

14:36.293 --> 14:38.126
Not too well actually.

14:38.259 --> 14:39.892
That's why I'm here to see you.

14:41.759 --> 14:43.826
I don't see how I can help.

14:45.959 --> 14:48.126
I'm going to bury my
mother in Greenvale.

14:51.293 --> 14:52.492
I don't think so.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.193
Well, why not?

14:56.325 --> 14:59.525
This was her home it should
be her resting place.

14:59.659 --> 15:05.092
The town policy is that
only residents of Greenvale

15:05.226 --> 15:07.092
can be buried in Greenvale.

15:08.059 --> 15:10.826
It's not like she
left here by choice.

15:10.959 --> 15:12.759
Her cow of a mother
abandoned her.

15:12.892 --> 15:14.392
She might have stayed
here her whole life

15:14.525 --> 15:15.792
if she'd have had the
chance with you lot.

15:15.926 --> 15:18.159
I seriously doubt that.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.425
And besides, it's irrelevant.

15:20.559 --> 15:25.059
Rules... rules, are
rules, are rules!

15:25.193 --> 15:26.859
You're so fucked up!

15:26.992 --> 15:28.892
I don't understand what's
wrong with you people.

15:29.026 --> 15:29.759
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:29.892 --> 15:30.926
I'm sorry who the fuck are you?

15:31.059 --> 15:31.725
Cut it, Sam!

15:31.859 --> 15:32.659
Cut it, Sam!

15:32.792 --> 15:34.959
Jane, can you give us a minute?

15:35.159 --> 15:37.392
Thanks for your help... not.

15:39.425 --> 15:40.659
I'll be in the diner.

15:41.392 --> 15:42.358
Hey, wait up.

15:42.492 --> 15:43.926
Don't you dare, motherfucker.

15:45.259 --> 15:46.458
Why you trippin'?

15:48.092 --> 15:49.392
Her mother's just died.

15:50.226 --> 15:51.259
I'm out of here.

15:54.092 --> 15:54.959
Christopher?

15:56.926 --> 15:58.126
Christopher?

15:58.259 --> 15:59.358
Look at me.

16:00.425 --> 16:01.625
Christopher!

16:03.325 --> 16:04.392
Focus!

16:12.425 --> 16:13.659
Hey, um...

16:15.092 --> 16:17.559
Why don't we grab a
few at the Bone Yard?

16:19.792 --> 16:23.392
Mom always loved
a drink. Why not?

16:25.193 --> 16:26.059
I can't.

16:27.725 --> 16:28.592
I can't.

16:34.725 --> 16:37.525
Hey, all right, all
right, all right.

16:37.659 --> 16:39.725
Let's give it up once again for

16:39.859 --> 16:43.792
Sandy Bells and her
famous One Man Band!

16:43.926 --> 16:45.759
All right, Sandy.

16:45.892 --> 16:47.625
Whoo, Sandy!

16:47.759 --> 16:49.625
Whoo!

16:49.926 --> 16:50.792
Yeah!

16:53.325 --> 16:54.559
Let me get that.

16:54.692 --> 16:57.692
Okay, well, now next we
have coming up for you

16:57.826 --> 17:00.159
here in the Bone Yard,
thank you, Sandy.

17:01.059 --> 17:05.425
We have the moment you
have all been waiting for.

17:05.559 --> 17:10.059
The one, the only Heart Slayer!

17:14.492 --> 17:15.392
Thanks for
the intro, dude.

17:15.525 --> 17:16.724
Hell, yeah, man.

17:17.692 --> 17:19.392
Here let me get the
mic for you here.

17:19.525 --> 17:20.759
I like that.

17:20.892 --> 17:22.826
- Thank you, Parta.
- Man, you rock it.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.826
Whew!

17:26.259 --> 17:27.925
Actually, I wrote it today.

17:28.059 --> 17:29.725
And this song is
called Situations.

Sure was.

18:52.026 --> 18:52.959
You were awesome.

18:54.959 --> 18:58.059
I've never met anyone
like you before.

18:59.026 --> 19:01.792
You know you never will
again if you stay here.

19:03.293 --> 19:05.659
You just need to go somewhere
where stuff happens,

19:05.792 --> 19:07.293
you know, like London.

19:07.425 --> 19:08.525
London?

19:08.759 --> 19:10.659
I could
get you some gigs.

19:13.026 --> 19:13.759
I don't know.

19:13.892 --> 19:15.492
Why not you're really talented.

19:23.692 --> 19:25.959
Be not afraid of greatness.

19:27.026 --> 19:28.059
Give me that.

19:28.193 --> 19:31.358
That's what father
always quoted to me.

19:33.525 --> 19:35.759
My mom used to try
and encourage me too...

19:37.092 --> 19:39.525
when we weren't at
each other's throats.

19:42.826 --> 19:44.859
You didn't
get along with her.

21:28.159 --> 21:29.159
Don't touch that!

21:29.293 --> 21:30.826
Don't... don't touch that!

21:33.092 --> 21:34.926
What the fuck are you doing
with my mom's suitcase?

21:35.059 --> 21:37.692
Weave, reset,
weave, concentrate.

21:37.826 --> 21:40.425
- Weave, concentrate.
- What the fuck is that thing?

21:40.559 --> 21:42.293
Weave, concentrate.

21:42.425 --> 21:43.725
Weave, weave.

21:44.126 --> 21:45.293
Look at me and speak to me!

21:45.425 --> 21:46.926
What the fuck is that?

21:47.159 --> 21:49.425
Oh, Jane.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.193
Jane, oh, oh.

21:51.325 --> 21:53.126
My soul, it broke.

21:53.259 --> 21:56.592
It broke when Emma was
taken away from me.

21:56.725 --> 21:58.325
What the fuck
are you talking about?

21:58.458 --> 21:59.592
- Your Emma?
- My Emma.

21:59.725 --> 22:00.959
You don't fucking
know my mother.

22:01.092 --> 22:03.625
- My Emma!
- You don't talk about her!

22:03.759 --> 22:05.926
You have to
understand that night.

22:06.059 --> 22:07.926
That night Emma, Emma.

22:09.559 --> 22:12.259
I had to, I had to
do it I'm sorry.

22:12.425 --> 22:13.826
I had defend myself!

22:13.959 --> 22:15.159
I had to do it!

22:15.859 --> 22:17.625
What the fuck are you saying?

22:18.826 --> 22:21.458
She came at
me I had to defend myself.

22:21.592 --> 22:22.458
I had to do it!

22:22.592 --> 22:24.092
You fucking freak!

22:24.592 --> 22:25.892
Get the fuck out of here!

22:26.026 --> 22:27.159
Freak!

22:50.226 --> 22:52.092
- He's out of his fucking mind.
- What the hell is going on?

22:52.226 --> 22:54.525
- He killed my mother.
- What are you talking about?

22:54.659 --> 22:55.792
- He killed my mother.
- What?

22:55.926 --> 22:57.259
- He tried to attack me.
- You know what,

22:57.392 --> 22:59.592
stay here, stay here.

23:05.992 --> 23:06.826
Christopher?

23:08.659 --> 23:10.792
Christopher, what
the hell happened?

23:12.425 --> 23:14.092
I deserved it.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.425
I deserved it.

23:16.559 --> 23:17.759
I deserved it.

23:23.293 --> 23:24.592
I deserved it.

23:25.692 --> 23:28.892
Christopher, you are
completely out of control.

23:30.226 --> 23:32.358
Just go to your room now,
and let me handle it.

23:32.492 --> 23:34.159
I don't need your protection!

23:34.293 --> 23:35.425
Oh, no?

23:37.592 --> 23:39.592
No, no, no.

23:39.725 --> 23:40.792
Oh, no!?

23:40.926 --> 23:43.026
You're so capable of
taking care of yourself

23:43.159 --> 23:46.392
that you just let that
bitch walk out of here?

25:17.259 --> 25:19.059
What are you doing?

25:22.525 --> 25:24.992
Give me this!

25:29.026 --> 25:29.992
Get off me!

25:39.725 --> 25:42.059
What are you doing?
Don't!

25:46.492 --> 25:47.559
Don't.

25:48.592 --> 25:49.759
Why, don't.

25:53.559 --> 25:57.425
All I ever wanted
was for me and Emma

25:57.559 --> 26:00.425
to find our way
back to each other.

26:05.092 --> 26:09.625
Have you ever wandered
what people would look like

26:09.759 --> 26:12.826
if they were the
reflections of their soul?

26:15.159 --> 26:17.692
I had to do it, Jane.

26:22.959 --> 26:23.859
I had to!

26:24.159 --> 26:26.026
You really gotta be more
sensitive, princess.

26:26.159 --> 26:28.725
You fucking, bitch.

26:35.425 --> 26:36.525
Christopher?

26:38.026 --> 26:39.425
Christopher.

26:44.759 --> 26:46.959
Look at me, Christopher!

26:53.692 --> 26:55.525
Clean this mess up.

27:39.425 --> 27:42.625
We could have made
her understand.

27:46.525 --> 27:52.692
I need my family, my blood.

27:53.325 --> 27:55.059
I am your family!

27:55.293 --> 27:56.126
No, no.

27:57.226 --> 28:00.259
More than those two bitches
ever were or could be.

28:00.392 --> 28:02.059
No, no.

28:03.159 --> 28:04.026
No.

28:04.959 --> 28:08.425
I swore to Father that
I would protect you

28:08.559 --> 28:10.358
whether you want me to or not.

28:10.492 --> 28:13.259
I never wanted it.

28:13.392 --> 28:16.458
- I'll have no more arguments.
- I never wanted you.

28:16.592 --> 28:19.525
I'll have no more
arguments, Christopher.

28:45.425 --> 28:46.826
Hey, what's going on?

28:48.259 --> 28:52.425
Damn, that trash, oh, it's rank.

28:52.559 --> 28:53.892
What a stench.

28:57.159 --> 28:58.059
Anyways.

29:00.759 --> 29:02.325
Either of you seen Jane?

29:08.059 --> 29:10.126
Yeah, she's on the
red-eye back to London.

29:10.259 --> 29:11.525
The red-eye?

29:11.659 --> 29:13.926
Yeah, she's probably
on the train right now.

29:15.293 --> 29:16.392
Okay.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.226
And you're sure?

29:21.358 --> 29:22.692
Yeah, I'm positive.

29:22.826 --> 29:24.559
She was running out of
here when I drove up.

29:32.425 --> 29:33.659
There goes London.

29:34.759 --> 29:35.659
Whoa.

29:36.759 --> 29:38.525
What's going on with you?

29:39.392 --> 29:40.926
Nothing, he's fine.

29:43.425 --> 29:44.992
Leave it, Sam!

29:45.126 --> 29:45.992
He's fine.

29:47.126 --> 29:47.926
Okay, Sheriff.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.959
I was finally gonna
get out of here.

29:58.092 --> 29:58.959
Finally.

30:00.458 --> 30:01.859
What are you talking about?

30:02.425 --> 30:03.625
Leaving Greenvale.

30:07.826 --> 30:10.759
You think she was gonna
take you to London?

30:10.892 --> 30:11.892
Yeah.

30:12.026 --> 30:14.492
You don't even have
a passport, Sam.

30:16.126 --> 30:16.992
Oh, well.

30:18.259 --> 30:19.325
That's right.

30:21.692 --> 30:23.325
Better work on that, dude.

30:29.992 --> 30:32.792
Christopher,
now that she's gone...

30:35.159 --> 30:36.792
can I have my room back?

30:36.926 --> 30:39.959
It was really harsh the
way you kicked me out.

30:40.092 --> 30:40.926
Of course.

30:41.892 --> 30:43.792
You'll sleep like
a baby tonight.

30:44.425 --> 30:45.559
Yeah, right.

30:50.059 --> 30:51.425
Here you go.

30:55.692 --> 30:59.059
Don't let that soup
get cold, all right.

30:59.193 --> 31:00.059
Thank you.

31:10.492 --> 31:11.659
How is it?

31:13.692 --> 31:15.525
It's delicious, Christopher.

31:19.358 --> 31:20.425
Drink it up.

31:26.525 --> 31:29.059
I'm never gonna get
out of this hell hole.

31:31.625 --> 31:32.792
None of us are.

31:51.458 --> 31:53.392
Gotta run after tea, mom.

31:53.525 --> 31:54.959
I'm going to a
concert with Mark.

31:55.159 --> 31:56.026
Oh.

31:57.159 --> 31:58.092
What's on?

31:58.226 --> 32:00.126
The Bugger Offs. They're wicked.

32:00.259 --> 32:01.425
Oh, god.

32:01.559 --> 32:02.592
I'm sorry.

32:03.492 --> 32:04.926
Mom, what's wrong?

32:05.059 --> 32:05.926
What's so funny?

32:07.792 --> 32:09.659
I'm about to bugger off, myself.

32:10.926 --> 32:11.826
Where to?

32:14.026 --> 32:15.592
Oh, fuck.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.293
Oh, fuck.

32:17.425 --> 32:19.525
- Mom, what's the matter?
- Oh, fuck.

32:22.026 --> 32:22.926
Jane.

32:24.293 --> 32:29.692
Darling, I've just returned
from seeing my physician.

32:29.859 --> 32:30.792
What for?

32:31.059 --> 32:34.392
It seems that I have an
inoperable brain tumor.

32:37.859 --> 32:40.826
I didn't want to involve you
until I knew for certain.

32:44.692 --> 32:47.425
I won't let you deal
with this on your own.

32:47.559 --> 32:48.792
Of course not.

32:50.092 --> 32:53.126
But there is something
I must do on my own.

32:53.259 --> 32:54.259
What?

32:54.392 --> 32:55.992
Go back to Greenvale.

32:56.926 --> 32:57.625
Where?

32:57.759 --> 32:59.559
The town where I was born.

33:01.226 --> 33:02.559
Where my mother left me.

33:03.692 --> 33:05.826
Mom, you've just told me
that you're terminally ill,

33:05.959 --> 33:07.725
and now you're buggering
off to some town

33:07.859 --> 33:10.792
in the middle of nowhere that
I've never heard of before.

33:10.926 --> 33:12.559
You can't do that to
me, Mom, it's not fair.

33:12.692 --> 33:15.059
This is not all about you, okay!

33:18.293 --> 33:21.892
Mom, you cannot
go off like this.

33:22.026 --> 33:23.126
You cannot leave me...

33:23.259 --> 33:24.792
I shall do as I wish!

33:29.126 --> 33:30.559
As you always have done,
Lady Macbeth.

33:30.692 --> 33:31.959
Just don't badger me!

33:32.092 --> 33:34.492
Okay, you don't know
anything about it.

33:54.392 --> 33:55.826
I'm sorry.

33:55.959 --> 33:57.059
Can I help you
find your seat, Miss?

33:59.126 --> 34:00.092
Help what?

34:00.226 --> 34:01.193
Can I help you find your seat?

34:01.325 --> 34:02.525
Um, yeah, I think it...

34:02.659 --> 34:03.926
It's
over by the window.

34:04.892 --> 34:05.759
There.

34:12.492 --> 34:14.092
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

34:15.926 --> 34:16.926
Thank you.

34:21.159 --> 34:21.992
Sorry.

34:23.159 --> 34:23.992
Is everything okay, Miss?

34:24.126 --> 34:25.259
Can I get you anything?

34:25.692 --> 34:27.592
How about a lobotomy?

34:28.193 --> 34:29.492
How about a Bloody Mary?

34:30.025 --> 34:30.859
Make it triple.

34:31.259 --> 34:32.725
I'll get you some water.

35:02.826 --> 35:04.458
All right, that
just about does it.

35:04.592 --> 35:05.992
Handsome as always.

35:06.692 --> 35:08.092
Your have the magic touch.

35:08.226 --> 35:10.892
Hey, the pumpkin festival's
happening this weekend.

35:11.026 --> 35:11.725
Do you wanna go?

35:11.859 --> 35:14.293
Yeah, it sounds like fun.

35:14.425 --> 35:17.392
The hot apple cider's
always so yummy.

35:17.525 --> 35:19.392
Father loved that festival.

35:22.892 --> 35:25.525
Sorry to interrupt
the coffee klatch,

35:25.659 --> 35:26.859
but there's this lady here

35:26.992 --> 35:28.592
that wants to see
you, Christopher.

35:28.725 --> 35:29.892
She sounds like the
Queen of England.

35:30.026 --> 35:31.325
Well, don't keep
her waiting, Sam.

35:31.458 --> 35:32.892
- Send her in.
- Okay, cool.

35:33.026 --> 35:33.892
You can come in, ma'am.

35:34.026 --> 35:34.959
Thank you.

35:37.092 --> 35:38.059
Good morning.

35:39.559 --> 35:40.358
May I help you?

35:40.492 --> 35:41.826
I do hope so.

35:43.293 --> 35:46.659
Christopher Dodd, yes?

35:46.792 --> 35:49.059
Yes, please sit down.

35:51.425 --> 35:52.525
Emma Grey.

35:55.193 --> 36:01.059
Mrs. Stanley over at the B&B
suggested that I come see you.

36:08.425 --> 36:10.859
Well, I do hope I'm
not interfering.

36:10.992 --> 36:12.592
So, Mrs. Grey, exactly
why are you in Greenvale?

36:12.725 --> 36:14.692
Thank you for
stopping by, Sheriff.

36:14.826 --> 36:16.959
See you after while,
have a good day.

36:28.026 --> 36:31.026
Mrs. Grey, at the
Stanley a guest?

36:32.226 --> 36:33.959
Oh, yes, yes.

36:37.293 --> 36:38.992
I'm a guest.

36:39.126 --> 36:40.525
Hmm, yes, yes.

36:41.392 --> 36:42.193
The muffins they're like stones.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.659
I nearly broke my tooth.

36:45.425 --> 36:46.492
I'm sorry.

36:48.625 --> 36:52.159
I was a little girl
here in Greenvale,

36:53.193 --> 36:54.992
and I've come to learn
that the diocese occupies

36:55.126 --> 36:58.859
my girlhood home and that
you actually live there.

36:58.992 --> 36:59.926
Really?

37:00.059 --> 37:00.926
Hmm.

37:01.892 --> 37:02.759
Mm-hmm.

37:05.926 --> 37:09.392
The lady who owned
the house was named...

37:09.559 --> 37:10.959
Mary Gerard?

37:11.892 --> 37:12.692
Right.

37:13.592 --> 37:14.926
She's been called
Mother Mary around here

37:15.059 --> 37:17.159
ever since she gave the
house to the diocese.

37:17.293 --> 37:20.392
Sam, please find
the Gerard file.

37:20.525 --> 37:21.592
Sure.

37:32.392 --> 37:33.425
Stop, stop please.

37:33.559 --> 37:35.926
I'm sorry.

37:43.358 --> 37:44.392
Here we go.

37:44.625 --> 37:46.792
Thank you, thank you.

37:50.959 --> 37:54.859
Here's the letter that your
mother left when she went away.

37:56.492 --> 37:59.293
Can somebody read
this for me, please?

37:59.425 --> 38:01.059
- Sure, ma'am.
- Thank you.

38:03.059 --> 38:05.325
"Dear Father Pedro.

38:05.458 --> 38:06.959
"I am unable to cope
with the reality

38:07.092 --> 38:09.992
"that Bobby won't be coming
home to me and Emma."

38:10.959 --> 38:13.926
"I am so ill with grief
that I'm no longer able

38:14.059 --> 38:18.159
"to care for myself or
my beloved angel, Emma."

38:18.293 --> 38:20.126
My angel.

38:20.592 --> 38:21.992
"I'm leaving Greenvale,

38:22.126 --> 38:24.959
"and I want the diocese
to have the house.

38:25.092 --> 38:27.792
"Please find a good home
for my precious angel.

38:29.625 --> 38:30.792
"Yours in faith,

38:32.992 --> 38:34.358
"Mary Gerard."

38:37.458 --> 38:41.126
Father Pedro, didn't
find the letter

38:41.259 --> 38:42.992
until about a week later,

38:43.926 --> 38:46.059
and then when he went
to the house, he...

38:46.992 --> 38:47.859
He, um.

38:48.759 --> 38:50.126
Go on.

38:50.259 --> 38:55.092
Found you in a fetal position
in the corner of your room.

38:56.126 --> 38:57.325
Oh, yes.

38:57.458 --> 38:59.492
Yes, that is where
my mother left me.

39:01.358 --> 39:02.425
Sorry.

39:05.892 --> 39:08.525
I need to go back to that house.

39:09.725 --> 39:11.458
Are you sure you
really wanna do that?

39:11.592 --> 39:12.525
It's the only thing I can do!

39:12.659 --> 39:14.458
Okay, okay, okay.

39:14.592 --> 39:16.892
Alright, I'll take
you over there now.

39:17.026 --> 39:18.392
It's okay.

39:18.525 --> 39:19.725
Thank you.

39:53.826 --> 39:57.226
It's funny how things
seem so different

39:57.358 --> 39:58.892
when you remember them.

40:00.926 --> 40:03.358
Please, make
yourself comfortable.

40:03.492 --> 40:05.325
Take a seat on the sofa.

40:17.358 --> 40:18.293
God!

40:18.425 --> 40:21.059
Nasty little bugger, aren't you?

40:21.193 --> 40:22.358
Friend of yours, is he?

40:22.492 --> 40:23.725
It's just a hobby.

40:23.859 --> 40:27.425
Making them is
very, very soothing.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.425
Perhaps I should try it then.

40:41.959 --> 40:43.425
<i>Please eat
your food, darling.</i>

40:43.559 --> 40:44.959
<i>It would mean so much to me.</i>

40:45.092 --> 40:47.226
<i>Why won't you play
with us, mama?</i>

40:47.358 --> 40:48.358
<i>We're hungry.</i>

40:48.492 --> 40:49.926
<i>You're not busy.</i>

40:50.059 --> 40:51.026
<i>Why can't I go?</i>

40:51.159 --> 40:52.458
<i>You're there every day.</i>

40:52.592 --> 40:54.725
<i>What's in there I
just wanna know.</i>

40:54.859 --> 40:57.392
<i>Please let me go
to the silo, mama.</i>

40:58.892 --> 41:00.859
<i>What was that man doing here?</i>

41:00.992 --> 41:02.092
<i>Did he hurt you?</i>

41:02.226 --> 41:03.525
<i>Why are you so upset?</i>

41:03.659 --> 41:05.126
<i>He's scary.</i>

41:09.293 --> 41:10.559
<i>Mama?</i>

41:10.692 --> 41:12.559
<i>Mama, where are you?</i>

41:14.525 --> 41:17.725
<i>♪ Ring around the rosy ♪</i>

41:17.859 --> 41:21.859
<i>♪ Pocket full of posies ♪</i>

41:33.759 --> 41:35.826
<i>You're hurting me, no!</i>

41:49.859 --> 41:51.659
Are you alright?

41:53.293 --> 41:54.226
Can I get you anything?

41:54.358 --> 41:56.859
No, I don't like to make a fuss.

41:56.992 --> 41:57.826
All right.

41:59.792 --> 42:03.725
I'll just be upstairs
if you do need anything.

43:24.159 --> 43:25.026
Mary.

43:26.325 --> 43:27.392
Here.

43:40.026 --> 43:41.826
How was your journey?

43:42.759 --> 43:43.625
Long.

43:47.092 --> 43:51.026
But I was excited about
getting back to Greenvale

43:52.592 --> 43:54.392
that I hardly noticed.

43:56.325 --> 43:57.425
Excited.

43:58.826 --> 44:00.325
- Greenvale?
- Yes.

44:03.692 --> 44:05.792
This will always be my home.

44:09.293 --> 44:10.725
Don't you know that, Mary?

44:14.959 --> 44:17.725
Can I get you something
to drink, father?

44:19.425 --> 44:20.525
How thoughtful.

44:22.525 --> 44:23.659
Cold water.

44:43.059 --> 44:46.759
I can't tell you how much
I missed your cooking.

44:48.992 --> 44:50.559
I'm pleased you like it.

44:50.692 --> 44:52.826
You have a true gift, Mary,

44:53.892 --> 44:55.226
one of many.

44:55.358 --> 44:56.492
Would you join me?

44:58.026 --> 44:58.959
Oh, no.

44:59.092 --> 45:00.592
Please, Mary.

45:01.592 --> 45:02.759
I want to tell you all about

45:02.892 --> 45:04.926
the amazing things
I've experienced.

45:09.692 --> 45:13.392
I miss our visits,

45:14.525 --> 45:18.559
how we would sit
for hours talking...

45:18.692 --> 45:20.293
Excuse me, father.

45:20.425 --> 45:22.159
I really must go.

45:22.293 --> 45:23.525
I'm late for Emma.

45:26.325 --> 45:27.525
Of course.

45:43.193 --> 45:47.592
I do love nothing in the
world so much as you.

45:49.193 --> 45:50.059
My angel.

47:13.559 --> 47:15.926
Nothing like a good breakfast.

47:17.159 --> 47:19.692
And this looks better than good.

47:20.826 --> 47:23.259
I'm sure Father Hammond
loved all of your attention.

47:23.392 --> 47:25.525
Father Hammond
was a goddamn pig.

47:28.226 --> 47:30.692
Oh, forgive me, Father.

47:30.826 --> 47:32.926
I shouldn't have said that.

47:33.059 --> 47:34.092
It's alright, Mary.

47:36.792 --> 47:38.358
Enjoy your breakfast.

47:39.259 --> 47:40.325
Mary.

47:41.458 --> 47:44.026
Sit down for a moment, please.

47:54.525 --> 47:57.692
I know it will take
sometime for us

47:57.826 --> 47:59.725
to get used to each other again.

48:00.725 --> 48:03.926
But you shouldn't be
anxious or nervous.

48:07.859 --> 48:10.193
I need to see to the house now.

48:10.325 --> 48:11.492
Excuse me.

48:20.826 --> 48:23.425
There will be a new cassock
in the sacristy for you.

48:23.559 --> 48:25.392
I made sure of it, Father.

48:28.092 --> 48:29.392
Take a look at this.

48:31.559 --> 48:33.126
I learned how to weave
these in a community

48:33.259 --> 48:36.059
that lives up high in
the lush mountains.

48:36.992 --> 48:38.458
It holds much power.

48:40.259 --> 48:41.226
And this, Mary,

48:42.059 --> 48:44.026
this is the most
exciting treasure of all.

48:46.159 --> 48:47.026
I'm sorry.

48:48.892 --> 48:50.026
Here.

48:50.159 --> 48:51.525
I brought this for Emma.

48:52.325 --> 48:53.425
How is she?

48:54.159 --> 48:56.159
She's wonderful.

48:56.293 --> 48:57.792
I'm glad to hear.

49:01.392 --> 49:03.026
I also have a gift for you.

49:06.892 --> 49:09.092
I cannot, I'm sorry, Father.

49:11.259 --> 49:12.325
Why not?

49:14.026 --> 49:16.792
Well, that's too beautiful
for the likes of me.

49:18.226 --> 49:19.092
Nonsense.

49:21.992 --> 49:22.926
It was made

49:25.559 --> 49:28.559
by women just like you

49:31.592 --> 49:34.392
for women just like you.

49:35.293 --> 49:36.759
Let me take a look at you.

50:03.492 --> 50:05.525
Well, Charles, come
on out with it.

50:06.559 --> 50:08.959
Well, I don't suppose
it really matters much.

50:09.092 --> 50:10.525
It's just that the
fellas around here,

50:10.659 --> 50:12.325
they don't seem too friendly.

50:12.458 --> 50:14.026
Not friendly?

50:14.159 --> 50:15.425
Are you sure they are the ones

50:15.559 --> 50:17.592
who are standoffish and not you?

50:17.725 --> 50:19.625
After all, you're the new one.

50:19.759 --> 50:22.259
Yes, Mary, but
maybe he's right.

50:22.392 --> 50:26.059
You know, kids can be pretty
rough on a newcomer sometimes.

51:09.759 --> 51:11.492
Good morning, Emma.

51:11.625 --> 51:12.725
Sleep well?

51:13.826 --> 51:14.659
Hmm, what?

51:16.159 --> 51:17.926
No, not really, never do.

51:18.126 --> 51:19.293
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

51:19.425 --> 51:20.659
Well, have a seat.

51:22.259 --> 51:23.325
Oh.

51:25.325 --> 51:29.592
You know, I was thinking
about my mother.

51:29.759 --> 51:30.826
Mm-hmm.

51:32.293 --> 51:34.159
She really was
quite loving to me.

51:34.293 --> 51:36.492
Oh, that's comforting, right?

51:37.392 --> 51:38.725
Oh.

51:38.859 --> 51:41.425
Oh, are these pumpkin pancakes?

51:42.892 --> 51:43.826
My mother...

51:47.392 --> 51:48.926
Sorry.

51:49.059 --> 51:50.959
By the way, thank you for
having my things brought over.

51:51.126 --> 51:52.725
Well, it is your home.

51:54.392 --> 51:56.525
Oh, goodness me look at this.

51:56.659 --> 52:00.559
Oh, this berry jam
looks wonderful.

52:00.692 --> 52:02.559
- I make it myself.
- Oh, tasty.

52:02.692 --> 52:05.226
And I went with blackberry
and strawberry.

52:05.358 --> 52:07.625
Sometimes I use
blueberries, you know.

52:07.759 --> 52:10.425
I also grow my own
herbs and dry them out.

52:10.559 --> 52:11.492
I cook with them.

52:11.625 --> 52:13.358
Do you wanna see my collection?

52:13.492 --> 52:14.525
I can show you.

52:14.659 --> 52:16.792
- What, hmm?
- The herbs.

52:16.926 --> 52:17.892
Herbs.

52:18.026 --> 52:20.458
Yeah, I have a
collection of herbs.

52:20.592 --> 52:21.859
Oh, all right.

52:23.293 --> 52:24.892
Mm.

52:25.026 --> 52:25.926
Mm.

52:27.259 --> 52:28.325
Mm.

52:29.392 --> 52:30.492
Wanna see?

52:30.625 --> 52:32.092
- Hmm?
- The herbs?

52:33.193 --> 52:34.425
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

52:35.392 --> 52:37.358
So we've got, um, well,
more jam.

52:37.492 --> 52:39.692
Please take as much as you want.

52:39.826 --> 52:41.193
Whatever you need,
whatever you want

52:41.325 --> 52:42.392
let me know and
I'll get it for you.

52:42.525 --> 52:43.992
I'll make it for you.

52:44.126 --> 52:47.226
So there's more of that,
and then there's some thyme

52:47.358 --> 52:50.792
and rosemary and
sage and hemlock.

52:52.325 --> 52:54.059
Hemlock. Whatever for?

52:54.193 --> 52:55.559
Well, it helps me to sleep

52:55.692 --> 52:57.092
and, you know, with
pain and stuff.

52:57.226 --> 52:59.293
Right, you better be careful
or you'll sleep forever.

53:01.525 --> 53:03.525
- Like I'm about to.
- Yeah.

53:04.692 --> 53:06.425
And do you know what I'll
have a nip of this cannabis

53:06.559 --> 53:07.692
if that's alright?

53:07.826 --> 53:09.059
- Of course.
- It's for the pain.

53:09.193 --> 53:10.293
Of course,
and there's a pipe

53:10.425 --> 53:11.193
right in here too for you.

53:11.325 --> 53:12.926
- Okay?
- Lovely.

53:13.059 --> 53:14.425
Enjoy your breakfast.

53:14.559 --> 53:17.293
Say, I'm gonna be leaving
for the office soon.

53:17.425 --> 53:19.092
Can I get you
anything before I go?

53:21.458 --> 53:22.525
What's that?

53:25.026 --> 53:27.259
What is that noise?

53:27.392 --> 53:28.859
What noise?

53:30.625 --> 53:32.792
Do you know what, I'll
go into town with you.

53:55.425 --> 53:56.525
Hey, dude.

53:57.226 --> 53:58.826
Not whacking off again, right?

54:06.926 --> 54:08.059
Christopher.

54:08.325 --> 54:09.193
Hmm?

54:09.325 --> 54:11.193
That lady's back again.

54:11.325 --> 54:13.092
She's waiting for you outside.

54:13.226 --> 54:15.059
Tell her I'll be there
in a minute, okay?

54:16.126 --> 54:17.325
Okay, bro.

54:54.059 --> 54:55.059
You cozy?

54:55.193 --> 54:56.059
Mm.

54:58.126 --> 55:01.059
Greenvale is a real
shit hole, isn't it?

55:01.193 --> 55:03.792
Yeah, but it's home.

55:03.926 --> 55:04.792
Hmm.

55:12.425 --> 55:13.792
What did you do today?

55:16.692 --> 55:20.926
I went for a lovely walk
actually by the lake

55:21.059 --> 55:23.959
and some lovely nature there,
would make for a nice picture.

55:24.092 --> 55:25.358
Oh, you're a painter?

55:25.559 --> 55:27.592
Yes, yeah.

55:27.725 --> 55:32.293
Landscapes, animals, people.

55:32.425 --> 55:33.525
Hmm-mm.

55:33.659 --> 55:35.992
There's this little monster

55:36.926 --> 55:39.325
that pops up in all
of my paintings.

55:39.458 --> 55:40.625
Oh?

55:40.759 --> 55:42.959
My collectors go crazy for him.

55:44.293 --> 55:45.358
They call him Caliban.

55:46.159 --> 55:49.692
Hmm, Caliban
that's interesting.

55:50.425 --> 55:51.525
Yeah.

56:16.592 --> 56:17.692
Hello, Father.

56:18.458 --> 56:19.792
Good afternoon, Mary.

56:20.525 --> 56:21.559
How are you?

56:22.826 --> 56:23.659
I'm fine.

56:24.759 --> 56:27.692
You haven't been back
to the rectory for days.

56:30.259 --> 56:31.425
Oh.

56:31.559 --> 56:34.026
Emma, has been so sick.

56:34.159 --> 56:35.259
It's a cold.

56:35.392 --> 56:36.792
Why didn't you phone?

56:39.358 --> 56:40.525
I'm sorry.

56:43.259 --> 56:44.358
How is she now?

56:45.492 --> 56:47.026
Much better, thank you.

56:47.159 --> 56:48.659
Back at school.

56:49.525 --> 56:50.692
I'm glad to hear.

56:55.293 --> 56:56.392
May I come in?

57:01.358 --> 57:02.392
Of course.

57:03.458 --> 57:04.525
Please.

57:18.559 --> 57:20.792
Oh, Lord, is that
the time already?

57:28.826 --> 57:31.026
Did you want something
to drink, Father?

57:32.159 --> 57:33.826
No, thank you.

57:39.792 --> 57:41.325
The house looks nice.

57:43.792 --> 57:44.659
Oh.

57:45.826 --> 57:48.759
Bobby's family didn't want
me living in the main house.

57:49.525 --> 57:51.358
So they put us up in the barn.

57:53.559 --> 57:57.859
Well, you've made a
nice home, despite them.

58:00.559 --> 58:02.358
Yeah, we did what we could.

58:04.692 --> 58:08.859
They were wheat farmers, right?

58:08.992 --> 58:09.792
Yeah.

58:10.759 --> 58:13.926
Bobby's granddaddy
and daddy were.

58:15.159 --> 58:17.992
But Bobby said he had
better things to do

58:18.126 --> 58:19.725
than to watch grass grow.

58:20.559 --> 58:23.926
Then the Korean War happened,

58:24.059 --> 58:27.926
and Bobby could never
stay away from a fight.

58:30.692 --> 58:34.126
I wonder if he married me
just to spite everybody.

58:35.226 --> 58:39.293
You know, the town's golden
boy taking its beast.

58:39.425 --> 58:40.325
Mary.

58:41.226 --> 58:44.725
You shouldn't think
of yourself like that.

58:44.859 --> 58:47.026
You are a wonderful woman.

58:47.159 --> 58:50.959
I wrote Bobby as
soon as I found out

58:51.092 --> 58:52.725
I was carrying Emma.

58:55.159 --> 58:56.592
But he didn't write back.

58:59.659 --> 59:01.525
I know how that feels.

59:02.725 --> 59:06.792
Then Emma came along
about five months later,

59:08.759 --> 59:11.092
and times got hard.

59:22.892 --> 59:23.792
Mary.

59:25.592 --> 59:28.959
I may have been
gone seven years,

59:29.092 --> 59:32.926
but I can still tell when
something is troubling you.

59:34.293 --> 59:35.592
What is it?

59:40.159 --> 59:42.458
It's in the silo.

59:43.425 --> 59:44.492
What?

59:47.959 --> 59:48.826
Just go.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:56.092
It's the devil's spawn.

01:00:57.525 --> 01:00:59.625
It's the devil's
spawn.

01:01:00.325 --> 01:01:01.926
The devil's spawn.

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:05.059
It's the devil's spawn.

01:01:13.358 --> 01:01:15.492
It's the devil's spawn.

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:20.625
What is that thing?

01:01:25.026 --> 01:01:26.259
Answer me!

01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:27.759
The devil!

01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:29.826
It was the devil that
marked me, father...

01:01:30.592 --> 01:01:33.293
when I was just a little girl

01:01:33.425 --> 01:01:35.293
no older than Emma is now.

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:39.992
And God gave me an angel,
and the devil gave me that.

01:01:42.159 --> 01:01:43.926
No, Mary.

01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:46.358
You are wrong.

01:01:49.159 --> 01:01:50.392
Hello, Emma.

01:01:53.259 --> 01:01:54.325
Look at you.

01:01:55.126 --> 01:01:55.992
I'm Father Pedro.

01:01:58.059 --> 01:01:59.026
It's okay, baby.

01:01:59.159 --> 01:02:01.159
It's okay now that you're here.

01:02:30.259 --> 01:02:32.458
What a rust bucket.

01:02:33.092 --> 01:02:35.358
There were plans to convert
it into something else

01:02:35.492 --> 01:02:37.859
over the years, like
a puppet theater.

01:02:39.692 --> 01:02:40.759
- That's funny.
- Never any money!

01:02:40.892 --> 01:02:41.959
Never any money.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:45.325
No, no, so they just
let it rot, yeah.

01:02:46.159 --> 01:02:49.293
You know what? It looks like
a petrified cock to me.

01:02:52.392 --> 01:02:54.392
Is that the appeal, darling?

01:02:55.092 --> 01:02:57.692
Doesn't have any appeal to me.

01:02:58.059 --> 01:03:00.392
You know what? You
should burn it down.

01:03:08.859 --> 01:03:11.859
Well, haven't you gone to
a bit of trouble, love?

01:03:11.992 --> 01:03:14.992
Well, yes, I wanted to make
it kind of special for you.

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.826
Oh.

01:03:20.259 --> 01:03:21.992
What was that?

01:03:22.126 --> 01:03:22.959
Yes, I got the fucker.

01:03:23.126 --> 01:03:24.392
What?

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:26.692
Check the corner,
love, over there.

01:03:26.826 --> 01:03:28.926
Yes, I've been
cleaning up the place.

01:03:36.059 --> 01:03:37.259
Oh, no.

01:03:37.392 --> 01:03:39.325
Oh, my Ben.

01:03:40.325 --> 01:03:41.592
My Ben.

01:03:58.892 --> 01:03:59.759
Right.

01:04:00.525 --> 01:04:05.325
Come, let us drink
down unkindness.

01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:06.926
Oh, yes, let's do that.

01:04:13.492 --> 01:04:15.926
Ah, nice.

01:04:17.092 --> 01:04:20.759
I can't remember the last
time someone actually...

01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:25.559
Jane, that's my daughter,
would never, ever...

01:04:25.692 --> 01:04:27.325
Jane that's a nice name.

01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:29.792
It's strong and
reliable, isn't it?

01:04:29.926 --> 01:04:30.492
Is it?

01:04:30.625 --> 01:04:31.692
I think so.

01:04:32.059 --> 01:04:34.392
Jane well she's a bit
of a bitch, that one is.

01:04:35.926 --> 01:04:38.293
Very much a child of
the "Me" generation.

01:04:38.425 --> 01:04:40.193
- Hmm-mm.
- Hmm.

01:04:40.692 --> 01:04:45.792
Yes, it was, um, lovely.

01:04:49.859 --> 01:04:50.592
Painter too.

01:04:50.725 --> 01:04:52.559
Oh, really what does she paint?

01:04:52.692 --> 01:04:54.859
Well, what does
she call it? Destructivism!

01:04:57.492 --> 01:05:00.325
Just like we were
part of the 70's,

01:05:00.458 --> 01:05:04.425
you know with the
flower power and LSD,

01:05:04.559 --> 01:05:07.092
peace and love and
all that rubbish.

01:05:07.226 --> 01:05:08.092
No?

01:05:10.425 --> 01:05:11.826
Love, what's wrong, love?

01:05:11.959 --> 01:05:14.193
Really, weren't you
into the groove?

01:05:14.325 --> 01:05:15.259
No, no.

01:05:15.392 --> 01:05:17.126
Punk, punk is more my thing.

01:05:18.259 --> 01:05:19.659
Yeah, people wouldn't
know it to look at me,

01:05:19.792 --> 01:05:21.892
but I love a good
punk, you know.

01:05:22.525 --> 01:05:24.059
People are always
surprised to hear it,

01:05:24.193 --> 01:05:26.992
but I love it when, grahh!
I like to get loose like that.

01:05:27.126 --> 01:05:30.592
And I've never been into
like group anything really.

01:05:30.959 --> 01:05:33.592
Sorry, I really
don't mean to be insensitive.

01:05:33.725 --> 01:05:36.425
No, no, me, I just like to
stay here, like at home,

01:05:36.559 --> 01:05:38.325
and listen to my music alone.

01:05:39.126 --> 01:05:41.126
As long as, you know,

01:05:41.259 --> 01:05:43.193
as long as you know your place,

01:05:43.325 --> 01:05:45.059
you will always be home.

01:05:45.959 --> 01:05:49.026
Well, you, you are lucky to
have been brought to England.

01:05:49.826 --> 01:05:54.392
Yeah, well, my aunt
and uncle took me in.

01:05:54.525 --> 01:05:56.293
Uh-huh, were they kind to you?

01:05:56.492 --> 01:06:01.126
Yes, she was very
proper... on the surface.

01:06:01.259 --> 01:06:03.226
What about your mommy and daddy?

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:08.458
Well, Mother died
when I was very young,

01:06:08.592 --> 01:06:12.592
and Father, he did do
the best he could.

01:06:14.193 --> 01:06:15.959
Oh, was that him in the picture?

01:06:17.159 --> 01:06:18.559
- Hmm?
- The picture?

01:06:18.692 --> 01:06:20.293
- Hmm?
- In your office?

01:06:20.425 --> 01:06:21.325
Worried looking fucker?

01:06:21.659 --> 01:06:23.059
Excuse me?

01:06:23.625 --> 01:06:25.659
I'm sorry, love, it's the tumor.

01:06:26.293 --> 01:06:27.392
Well, you know what...

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.392
He reminds me of someone.

01:06:30.392 --> 01:06:32.959
He was knowledgeable
and worldly.

01:06:33.092 --> 01:06:36.859
He instilled me in a love
of literature and chess

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:40.525
and music and going outside
into nature, going outdoors.

01:06:41.425 --> 01:06:43.392
How lovely, where is he now?

01:06:44.026 --> 01:06:46.959
Well, he's dead.

01:06:50.425 --> 01:06:51.492
Emma.

01:06:53.725 --> 01:06:55.458
Emma, please sit back.

01:06:55.592 --> 01:06:56.859
Sit back.

01:06:58.092 --> 01:06:59.592
Easy, easy.

01:06:59.725 --> 01:07:01.659
Careful, careful, careful.

01:07:01.792 --> 01:07:03.759
Sit back, straighten
up your head.

01:07:04.592 --> 01:07:05.892
Put your head.

01:07:06.026 --> 01:07:07.026
Hmm.

01:07:07.159 --> 01:07:08.425
Oh, here.

01:07:08.559 --> 01:07:10.525
Here, let's get you
to your room, okay.

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.193
Come on, come on hold onto me.

01:07:12.325 --> 01:07:13.659
You can hold onto me!

01:07:14.425 --> 01:07:15.525
Hold onto me.

01:08:10.959 --> 01:08:12.692
Our Father in heaven.

01:08:12.826 --> 01:08:14.126
Hallowed be thy name.

01:08:14.259 --> 01:08:16.292
Thy kingdom come.

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:17.492
-Thy will be done.

01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:19.091
-On earth as it is in Heaven.

01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:20.625
- Give us the day...
- Our daily bread.

01:08:20.759 --> 01:08:23.325
And forgive
us our trespasses

01:08:23.457 --> 01:08:26.358
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

01:08:26.492 --> 01:08:29.759
- And lead us not...
- Into temptation.

01:08:30.559 --> 01:08:33.292
And deliver us from evil.

01:09:38.892 --> 01:09:40.524
Oh.

01:09:40.658 --> 01:09:41.692
Hello, Father.

01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:45.392
That was a wonderful
sermon today.

01:09:45.524 --> 01:09:46.591
Thank you.

01:09:48.026 --> 01:09:48.892
Where is Emma?

01:09:50.524 --> 01:09:52.059
At a friends house.

01:09:52.193 --> 01:09:53.059
Good.

01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:58.659
Mary...

01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:04.592
What you are doing is wrong?

01:10:04.725 --> 01:10:08.792
And I'm certain that the
heavenly bodies do not approve.

01:10:11.293 --> 01:10:13.992
They abandoned me.

01:10:18.926 --> 01:10:23.926
That creature it just
came out of me one night.

01:10:26.126 --> 01:10:27.692
It ripped me apart!

01:10:32.725 --> 01:10:33.926
I wanted to burn it.

01:10:36.059 --> 01:10:39.059
But the Lord wouldn't approve
of that, would he, Father?

01:10:40.592 --> 01:10:43.392
What else could I do
but what I have done?

01:10:44.425 --> 01:10:45.492
Mary.

01:10:47.425 --> 01:10:51.759
Do you know what
that actually is?

01:10:53.392 --> 01:10:56.492
Not only have you locked away

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:59.659
and tortured an innocent child,

01:10:59.792 --> 01:11:02.926
you also have damaged Emma.

01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:05.226
Surely, she must know.

01:11:06.293 --> 01:11:10.959
Emma knows not to go near that
silo, and she is obedient.

01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:15.425
If you want any
chance at salvation,

01:11:15.559 --> 01:11:18.092
you will come with me now.

01:11:18.226 --> 01:11:19.392
No.

01:11:21.692 --> 01:11:25.826
Mary, you are going
to cleanse that child

01:11:25.959 --> 01:11:28.559
just like Jesus
cleaned the beggars

01:11:28.692 --> 01:11:30.492
and the whores and the lepers.

01:11:32.826 --> 01:11:37.559
Jesus did not cleanse Satan
in the Garden of Gethsemane.

01:11:37.692 --> 01:11:39.592
He vanquished him.

01:11:39.759 --> 01:11:40.592
Mary...

01:11:42.659 --> 01:11:47.059
You are that child's mother.

01:11:47.193 --> 01:11:49.759
Its protector not its captor.

01:11:49.892 --> 01:11:50.959
Not its judge!

01:11:51.092 --> 01:11:51.959
I cannot!

01:11:53.625 --> 01:11:55.458
I will not.

01:11:56.159 --> 01:11:57.826
No, I won't do it.

01:12:31.759 --> 01:12:32.659
Hello.

01:12:35.026 --> 01:12:35.926
Hello, child.

01:12:39.092 --> 01:12:40.059
It's all right.

01:12:41.625 --> 01:12:42.992
Do not be afraid.

01:12:54.859 --> 01:12:55.725
Dear God.

01:12:57.692 --> 01:12:59.926
What has she done to you?

01:13:42.392 --> 01:13:43.458
Light.

01:13:46.193 --> 01:13:47.559
Light and air.

01:14:18.293 --> 01:14:20.926
She will never hurt you again.

01:14:30.293 --> 01:14:31.692
Oh, it got you, didn't it?

01:14:31.826 --> 01:14:35.358
Mary, that child is
frightened out of his mind.

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:41.625
You need to take him outside,

01:14:41.759 --> 01:14:45.725
and clean him of all that filth.

01:14:45.859 --> 01:14:46.859
That creature was born of filth!

01:14:46.992 --> 01:14:48.126
-No more lies, Mary.

01:14:49.226 --> 01:14:53.992
I swear to God I will
bring the sheriff here.

01:14:54.126 --> 01:14:58.358
Emma will be taken from you,
and you will be locked away.

01:14:58.492 --> 01:14:59.725
You wouldn't!

01:15:00.425 --> 01:15:01.525
Mary.

01:15:02.659 --> 01:15:05.259
You made a terrible mistake.

01:15:05.392 --> 01:15:08.692
But <i>we</i> can make it right.

01:15:10.325 --> 01:15:11.926
I am with <i>you.</i>

01:15:51.026 --> 01:15:52.892
<i>♪ I'm going on a picnic ♪</i>

01:15:53.026 --> 01:15:55.193
<i>♪ And I bring spice cake ♪</i>

01:16:02.425 --> 01:16:05.392
I wanna stay with you, Mama.

01:16:06.159 --> 01:16:07.126
I wanna stay.

01:16:56.092 --> 01:16:56.959
It's you.

01:17:07.959 --> 01:17:10.193
<i>I'm going on a picnic,</i>

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:11.892
and I'm bringing ants.

01:17:12.026 --> 01:17:15.559
You can't bring ants to
a picnic, silly angel.

01:17:15.692 --> 01:17:17.092
What are you bringing?

01:17:17.226 --> 01:17:20.126
I'm going on a picnic, and
I'm bringing spice cake.

01:17:20.259 --> 01:17:22.126
Oh, ants love spice cake.

01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:23.425
So do monsters.

01:17:29.492 --> 01:17:30.692
I know what you've been doing.

01:17:30.826 --> 01:17:33.358
You snuck into that silo.

01:17:33.492 --> 01:17:36.159
You let that demon touch you.

01:17:36.293 --> 01:17:38.325
I can smell it on you.

01:17:38.525 --> 01:17:40.892
I can smell it on you!

01:17:41.026 --> 01:17:42.159
No, Mama!

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:43.659
Emma.

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.293
Mama, I love you.

01:17:45.425 --> 01:17:47.293
Shut up, just shut up!

01:17:47.425 --> 01:17:49.625
Stay in there with it!

01:17:49.759 --> 01:17:51.692
I love you, Mama.

01:17:54.226 --> 01:17:57.826
Hell is empty and all
the devils are here.

01:17:57.959 --> 01:17:59.092
You'll burn!

01:18:07.926 --> 01:18:09.392
Oh, Emma.

01:18:13.592 --> 01:18:15.625
No, Emma.

01:18:15.759 --> 01:18:16.892
Please.

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:19.859
Please, I need you.

01:18:20.559 --> 01:18:22.826
Please, I love you, Emma.

01:18:35.059 --> 01:18:36.792
Good morning, my angel.

01:18:39.959 --> 01:18:44.358
Now, you're going to Teresa's
after school today, right?

01:18:46.926 --> 01:18:52.325
Now, I need you to stay
there until I call over.

01:18:55.026 --> 01:18:55.926
Understand?

01:19:00.992 --> 01:19:05.692
Oh, hurry now before your
breakfast gets cold, okay?

01:19:05.826 --> 01:19:08.792
Better three hours too soon
than a minute late, honey.

01:19:11.892 --> 01:19:12.792
There.

01:19:15.425 --> 01:19:16.892
Goodbye, my angel.

01:19:18.592 --> 01:19:19.659
Come here.

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:26.358
Oh, I love you.

01:19:26.492 --> 01:19:29.092
I love you forever and ever.

01:19:29.992 --> 01:19:31.458
Go, girl, go on.

01:19:31.592 --> 01:19:34.559
Oh, thank you, that's beautiful.

01:20:53.692 --> 01:20:55.525
Did you do as I said?

01:21:02.692 --> 01:21:03.992
Did you bathe him?

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:07.059
I'd sooner fuck a pig.

01:21:09.826 --> 01:21:10.659
Mary...

01:21:12.525 --> 01:21:14.026
Where is he now?

01:21:15.092 --> 01:21:19.492
It's outside, in the
sun like you wanted!

01:21:20.892 --> 01:21:21.792
Alone?

01:21:22.892 --> 01:21:26.826
I pray the Lord burns
that demon to hell.

01:21:30.092 --> 01:21:34.425
God has given you one face,
and you made yourself another.

01:21:34.559 --> 01:21:35.692
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:21:35.826 --> 01:21:37.525
You are that child's mother.

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:40.625
That thing is not my child!

01:21:40.759 --> 01:21:41.659
Mary!

01:21:45.159 --> 01:21:46.226
He...

01:21:46.659 --> 01:21:50.358
He is our son.

01:21:53.859 --> 01:21:56.592
My son.

01:22:01.559 --> 01:22:07.759
We made love the
night before I left.

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:11.826
No, the demons.

01:22:12.792 --> 01:22:16.692
The demons they must
have possessed us.

01:22:16.826 --> 01:22:19.193
'Cause Bobby is
coming home soon.

01:22:19.425 --> 01:22:21.059
Bobby was killed in Korea, Mary.

01:22:22.159 --> 01:22:23.992
Bobby is not dead!

01:22:24.126 --> 01:22:25.159
He is not dead!

01:22:25.293 --> 01:22:26.592
He's not gonna abandon me.

01:22:26.725 --> 01:22:29.792
God, you lie up to
the hearing of the gods!

01:24:53.226 --> 01:24:55.193
You filthy girl!

01:25:13.159 --> 01:25:14.293
Forgive me, Father.

01:25:14.425 --> 01:25:15.559
Forgive me.

01:25:39.425 --> 01:25:40.492
God.

01:25:41.193 --> 01:25:42.059
Mary?

01:25:45.159 --> 01:25:46.059
Mary.

01:25:47.659 --> 01:25:49.725
God, please, Mary.

01:25:50.425 --> 01:25:51.425
Please.

01:25:51.559 --> 01:25:52.826
Mary, please.

01:25:58.392 --> 01:25:59.458
No, no.

01:26:03.259 --> 01:26:04.159
Stay.

01:26:04.293 --> 01:26:05.358
Stay.

01:26:30.458 --> 01:26:31.525
God.
