00:52.086 --> 00:54.433
- Mayday, mayday,
mayday, I can't control it!

00:54.433 --> 00:56.021
I'm rolling, I'm rolling!

00:56.021 --> 00:57.264
- Oh, my God!
- Hold on!

00:57.264 --> 00:58.575
- Help, help!

01:06.238 --> 01:07.619
- Well, see if
you can see the tops

01:07.619 --> 01:08.896
of the ridge there or not?

01:08.896 --> 01:10.380
Just let me know if you
see anything down there

01:10.380 --> 01:13.418
that doesn't look right.
- Nah, not seeing anything

01:13.418 --> 01:14.557
else around that area.

01:15.765 --> 01:17.146
- What is it, Mitch?

01:18.561 --> 01:21.598
- Mr. Hawes we,

01:24.084 --> 01:25.257
we lost one.

01:25.257 --> 01:26.327
- Search
and rescue teams

01:26.327 --> 01:28.260
don't know who was onboard

01:28.260 --> 01:30.159
or whether anyone survived.

01:30.159 --> 01:32.402
- It was Darren's plane?
- Yes, sir.

01:32.402 --> 01:33.783
- Was there anyone with him?
- This is such

01:33.783 --> 01:35.267
a tragic situation.

01:35.267 --> 01:38.201
- Yeah, we lost contact
with them 23 minutes ago.

01:38.201 --> 01:39.375
Based on the flight plan,

01:39.375 --> 01:40.686
that's a search area of,

01:40.686 --> 01:42.343
- Yeah, lot's
of remote places.

01:42.343 --> 01:44.621
- 1168 square miles.

01:44.621 --> 01:45.588
- That's
a pretty good area.

01:45.588 --> 01:46.692
Possibly one of the

01:46.692 --> 01:48.142
most remote.
- Yeah, a pilot

01:48.142 --> 01:49.764
and two passengers.

01:49.764 --> 01:51.180
- We know that
there were three occupants

01:51.180 --> 01:53.389
in the plane, two
males and a female.

01:53.389 --> 01:55.045
- Don't tell me you
don't know where they are.

01:55.045 --> 01:56.806
- Sir, I'm just telling
you what they told me.

01:56.806 --> 01:58.325
- At this
point we're hoping

01:58.325 --> 01:59.498
that daylight helps us

01:59.498 --> 02:00.534
and that we can
actually see something,

02:00.534 --> 02:02.052
but we have not found anything

02:02.052 --> 02:03.916
that we can correlate to the
missing persons or the plane.

02:39.366 --> 02:40.505
- We rejoice in our sufferings.

02:40.505 --> 02:41.747
We rejoice in our sufferings.

02:41.747 --> 02:43.749
Knowing that suffering
produces endurance.

02:43.749 --> 02:46.373
Suffering produces endurance.

03:05.702 --> 03:10.466
Rachel?

03:22.029 --> 03:25.343
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.

03:49.194 --> 03:50.091
Rachel?

04:18.810 --> 04:20.087
Okay.

04:23.746 --> 04:25.334
Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:26.887 --> 04:28.475
No, no, no, nobody.

04:30.649 --> 04:34.032
No, no, no, nobody.

04:34.032 --> 04:37.104
Stop bleeding, stop
bleeding, stop.

05:08.135 --> 05:08.963
Rachel?

05:10.827 --> 05:11.656
Rachel?

05:21.424 --> 05:22.287
Rachel?

05:35.127 --> 05:35.956
Rachel?

05:36.888 --> 05:37.716
Rachel?

05:56.286 --> 05:57.115
Rachel?

05:58.461 --> 05:59.324
Rachel?

06:04.087 --> 06:04.916
Rachel?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.228
Rachel?

06:09.196 --> 06:10.335
Rachel?

06:10.335 --> 06:11.681
Rachel?

06:17.825 --> 06:19.275
Oh, God, oh, God.

06:20.241 --> 06:21.311
Where is she?

06:22.658 --> 06:24.314
No, no, no, no, no.

06:24.314 --> 06:25.143
No, no.

06:32.633 --> 06:33.841
God.

08:51.151 --> 08:52.635
Another bad night?

08:57.606 --> 08:59.124
Another bad night.

09:01.886 --> 09:02.887
Murray called.

09:04.820 --> 09:06.960
The partner's in Dubai
accepted that offer.

09:08.893 --> 09:10.446
I've gotta go close the deal.

09:20.767 --> 09:24.046
Rachel, I know this
is difficult for you,

09:25.772 --> 09:27.981
but I've tried everything
I can to try to help you,

09:27.981 --> 09:29.569
and nothing is working.

09:33.089 --> 09:35.264
Maybe you do need to
go talk to somebody.

09:40.856 --> 09:45.861
God knows
you're not talking to me.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.175
We've gotta move on.

09:50.175 --> 09:53.213
Baby, we can't keep
going like this.

09:57.217 --> 09:59.599
I can't keep going like this.

10:01.842 --> 10:02.843
It happened.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.536
There's nothing we
can do about it.

10:09.574 --> 10:10.402
- Just go.

10:12.163 --> 10:14.061
- Rachel, please.

10:14.061 --> 10:14.890
- Just go.

10:55.206 --> 10:57.484
- I'll call you when I land.

11:36.316 --> 11:39.215
What is the point
in staring at it?

11:40.838 --> 11:42.563
This is not unusual Rachel.

11:43.461 --> 11:44.945
You heard what Dr. Norris said.

11:46.015 --> 11:48.259
This happens to a lot of people.

11:50.675 --> 11:52.297
And listening to crap like
what your sister said,

11:52.297 --> 11:53.609
that God needs another angel,

11:53.609 --> 11:55.645
that's just making it worse.

11:55.645 --> 11:56.716
You gotta let it go.

11:58.821 --> 12:00.374
- You said you would call.

12:03.170 --> 12:03.999
- What?

12:05.172 --> 12:06.795
- Last week when
you went to Dubai.

12:08.451 --> 12:10.246
You said you'd call
when you landed,

12:11.316 --> 12:12.662
but you didn't call.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.081
- We got called right into the
meeting as soon as I landed.

12:17.081 --> 12:18.634
I couldn't help that.

12:18.634 --> 12:22.327
Ah, look, okay, we're not
talking about that Rachel.

12:22.327 --> 12:23.604
We're talking about this.

12:23.604 --> 12:24.744
It has been four months.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.331
You have got to start healing.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.162
For us.

12:29.162 --> 12:29.990
For me.

12:31.509 --> 12:33.028
- You promised you'd call.

12:43.176 --> 12:47.628
My baby.

12:55.705 --> 12:58.432
More, more than that,

13:00.262 --> 13:04.162
we rejoice in our
sufferings,

13:05.612 --> 13:08.339
knowing that sufferings
produce endurance,

13:09.581 --> 13:12.515
and endurance
produces character,

13:16.036 --> 13:18.383
and character produces hope.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.806
Rachel?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.690
You need more angels?

15:06.698 --> 15:07.527
Hello?

15:13.153 --> 15:13.982
Hello?

15:15.190 --> 15:16.191
I need help.

15:20.850 --> 15:21.679
Great.

15:29.514 --> 15:31.102
- Richard.

15:35.451 --> 15:36.280
- Rachel?

15:38.799 --> 15:39.628
Rachel?

15:40.560 --> 15:41.388
Rachel?

15:48.844 --> 15:49.810
- Richard.

15:51.571 --> 15:53.297
- Rachel.

15:53.297 --> 15:55.092
Rachel, keep talking,
where are you?

15:56.748 --> 15:57.577
Rachel?

16:00.062 --> 16:03.307
Rachel?

16:03.307 --> 16:04.135
Rachel?

16:05.585 --> 16:06.413
Rachel?

16:17.528 --> 16:18.598
Rachel.

16:18.598 --> 16:19.633
Baby.

16:19.633 --> 16:21.394
- Richard.
- Oh, baby.

16:25.156 --> 16:27.469
I, um, I gotta go out.

16:28.884 --> 16:30.092
- Okay.

16:30.092 --> 16:31.542
- Yeah,
the finance team

16:31.542 --> 16:33.337
is coming back from
Mexico City early.

16:33.337 --> 16:34.683
You know, that deal's
been hanging by a thread,

16:34.683 --> 16:36.857
so we've gotta strategize.

16:39.170 --> 16:40.137
- On a Sunday?

16:41.138 --> 16:43.209
- Yes, on a Sunday.

16:43.209 --> 16:44.486
We've gotta get ready.

16:44.486 --> 16:46.177
You know this is a
huge deal Rachel.

16:46.177 --> 16:47.006
- Okay.

16:50.181 --> 16:52.839
Richard, can we just talk?

16:52.839 --> 16:54.944
Can we just talk for a minute?

16:54.944 --> 16:56.429
- Right now?

16:56.429 --> 17:00.467
- Well, yeah, I wanted to
talk about what's been--

17:00.467 --> 17:02.366
- You wanna talk about that now?

17:03.677 --> 17:05.023
Huh.
- Richard,

17:05.023 --> 17:07.060
I just thought--
- For six months, Rachel,

17:07.060 --> 17:09.476
six months I have been
begging you to talk to me

17:09.476 --> 17:11.237
and you won't open
your mouth at all,

17:11.237 --> 17:12.790
and now I've gotta go prepare

17:12.790 --> 17:14.964
for the biggest deal of the
year and you wanna open up?

17:14.964 --> 17:17.036
No, I'm not gonna talk.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.313
I've gotta make a living.

17:22.938 --> 17:25.699
Besides, you've got
your church people

17:25.699 --> 17:26.976
and your sister to talk to

17:26.976 --> 17:29.600
and that book to talk to.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.946
What do you need me for?

17:41.405 --> 17:42.233
Look.

17:47.583 --> 17:48.515
I gotta go.

18:08.708 --> 18:10.261
Oh, baby.
- When I step

18:10.261 --> 18:11.987
it really hurts,

18:11.987 --> 18:14.403
and I can't move my leg.

18:18.131 --> 18:22.101
Okay, okay, um,

18:22.101 --> 18:23.757
you're gonna be okay, baby.

18:23.757 --> 18:26.346
Alright?
- And my stomach.

18:31.765 --> 18:33.215
Am I bleeding on the inside?

18:33.215 --> 18:36.908
- No, no, it's just a
bruise from the seatbelt.

18:39.014 --> 18:39.877
I'm gonna pick you up,

18:39.877 --> 18:41.603
and keep it comfortable.

18:41.603 --> 18:43.260
Don't, I'll do it, I'll do it.

18:43.260 --> 18:44.192
I'll do it, I'll
do it, I'll do it.

18:44.192 --> 18:45.503
Okay, okay, okay.

18:45.503 --> 18:49.058
Okay, you okay?
- No.

18:49.058 --> 18:50.612
- Don't move your legs,
I'm gonna save you, baby.

18:50.612 --> 18:53.891
Just, just, be still.

18:55.030 --> 18:56.514
It's okay, it's okay.

18:56.514 --> 18:58.137
It's okay, it's okay,

18:58.137 --> 19:03.072
it's okay.

19:04.177 --> 19:07.836
It's okay, it's okay.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.045
Oh, baby.

19:12.220 --> 19:13.082
- Richard?

19:13.082 --> 19:14.291
- It's okay.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.776
We're gonna get out
of here, alright?

19:16.776 --> 19:18.053
- What happened?

19:18.053 --> 19:19.019
What happened?

19:19.019 --> 19:20.331
- I don't know.

19:20.331 --> 19:21.815
The plane, it just,

19:21.815 --> 19:23.058
the plane starting shaking

19:23.058 --> 19:25.854
and then we started
spinning and falling,

19:25.854 --> 19:28.443
and I don't remember
anything after that.

19:28.443 --> 19:31.170
I don't know.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.723
- The pilot, Darren,
what happened?

19:32.723 --> 19:33.551
Is he alright?

19:36.658 --> 19:39.419
Oh, God.

19:39.419 --> 19:41.352
- It's okay, baby, I'm
gonna get you outta here.

19:41.352 --> 19:44.044
- Well, where, where is here?

19:44.044 --> 19:46.254
- One thing at a time.

19:46.254 --> 19:48.739
I've gotta get you back.

19:48.739 --> 19:50.568
- Back where?

19:51.776 --> 19:53.537
- Okay, to the plane.

19:55.263 --> 19:56.195
We'll find shelter there.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.782
I can keep you warm,

19:57.782 --> 20:00.026
and, and if somebody
comes looking for us,

20:00.026 --> 20:02.822
that's gonna be the first place
they're gonna look, alright?

20:03.754 --> 20:04.789
- I can't walk.

20:06.412 --> 20:07.965
- Baby, I know that.

20:07.965 --> 20:09.208
I know you can't walk,

20:09.208 --> 20:10.623
I'm gonna figure this out.

20:10.623 --> 20:12.452
I promise you, I
will figure this out,

20:12.452 --> 20:14.489
but I've gotta go, I'll be back.

20:14.489 --> 20:15.904
I promise, I'll be back.

20:15.904 --> 20:16.870
- No, you're leaving?

20:16.870 --> 20:18.355
Richard, no, no, no.

20:18.355 --> 20:19.735
- Rachel please, it's alright.
- No, please, don't do this.

20:19.735 --> 20:20.943
I'll be back.

20:20.943 --> 20:23.152
- Rich, please don't leave me.

20:24.430 --> 20:25.258
Please.

20:57.601 --> 20:59.603
I didn't know where you were.

20:59.603 --> 21:01.501
Oh, God, your arm.

21:01.501 --> 21:03.503
Oh.
- It's okay.

21:03.503 --> 21:05.471
I'll stop the bleeding later.

21:05.471 --> 21:06.299
It slowed down.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.373
I thought you were dead.

21:11.373 --> 21:12.236
- Uh-huh.

21:20.002 --> 21:21.003
You know what I
was thinking about

21:21.003 --> 21:22.591
before we got here?

21:25.042 --> 21:26.181
- What?

21:26.181 --> 21:28.908
- Our honeymoon.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.393
Do, do you remember?

21:33.568 --> 21:34.741
- Of course I remember.

21:36.225 --> 21:38.504
Bermuda.

21:38.504 --> 21:40.609
The cocktails, the beach.
- Mm.

21:44.337 --> 21:47.685
I remember sitting and
watching the sunset.

21:49.894 --> 21:51.310
We talked all night long,

21:53.242 --> 21:54.934
waited for the sun
to come back up.

21:57.039 --> 21:58.317
Do you remember?

21:59.732 --> 22:01.009
- We really did that, didn't we?

22:01.009 --> 22:01.837
- Mm-hmm.

22:03.494 --> 22:04.633
Do you remember what it cost?

22:04.633 --> 22:07.636
- Huh, yes, I
remember what it cost.

22:07.636 --> 22:08.637
I didn't think we'd
have enough money

22:08.637 --> 22:10.398
to pay the rent, but we got by.

22:10.398 --> 22:11.364
I didn't think we'd
have enough money

22:11.364 --> 22:12.503
to pay any of the bills.

22:12.503 --> 22:14.022
- No, do you
remember you saying,

22:14.022 --> 22:15.299
we were afraid we were gonna

22:15.299 --> 22:16.093
not have gas?
- We would not have enough gas

22:16.093 --> 22:20.822
to get home.

22:21.926 --> 22:22.824
I'm glad those
days are behind us.

22:24.446 --> 22:25.309
- Really?

22:26.552 --> 22:27.380
- Absolutely.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.658
- I don't know.

22:30.797 --> 22:33.179
I remember how simple
those times were.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.007
- Simple?

22:34.007 --> 22:34.836
- Yeah.

22:35.837 --> 22:37.528
- That was a struggle.

22:37.528 --> 22:38.943
It wasn't simple.

22:38.943 --> 22:40.945
Everyday was a struggle.

22:40.945 --> 22:42.568
- Look, that's not what I mean.

22:42.568 --> 22:45.709
Simple like we didn't have much

22:45.709 --> 22:48.436
but we didn't need much.

22:50.438 --> 22:52.371
- I remember it more like

22:52.371 --> 22:53.717
we didn't want much
because we didn't

22:53.717 --> 22:55.408
have anyway to get
anything anyway.

22:57.686 --> 22:59.619
- I don't know, there's
something really simple

22:59.619 --> 23:00.551
about that time.

23:02.001 --> 23:04.175
That time in our lives when

23:04.175 --> 23:07.800
we didn't have the
big house or the cars.

23:07.800 --> 23:08.732
The wine cellar.

23:10.734 --> 23:13.875
Just, just us.

23:13.875 --> 23:15.255
It was nice.

23:15.255 --> 23:18.880
- Yeah, just us in a
750 square foot home

23:18.880 --> 23:21.089
with no hot water.

23:21.089 --> 23:22.055
Do you remember that?

23:22.055 --> 23:22.884
- I remember.

23:26.681 --> 23:28.407
You know sometimes I think about

23:29.649 --> 23:30.478
how things would be if I--

23:30.478 --> 23:31.375
- Rachel, stop.

23:33.032 --> 23:34.240
I've gotta take care of you.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.173
I've gotta get you back
to the plane, okay?

23:37.933 --> 23:38.727
Trust me.

23:43.145 --> 23:43.974
Trust me.

23:44.940 --> 23:45.872
I promise.

25:00.119 --> 25:01.120
Rachel?

25:01.120 --> 25:02.224
Rachel, I'm back.

25:03.674 --> 25:04.917
I'm back.

25:04.917 --> 25:08.507
Okay, I've got this
figured out, okay?

25:08.507 --> 25:09.818
Alright.

25:09.818 --> 25:11.199
You've gotta trust me, alright?

25:11.199 --> 25:12.683
I've got to get you out.

25:12.683 --> 25:13.960
- Richard, this is--

25:13.960 --> 25:15.514
- I've gotta get you
back, just trust me.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.515
Alright.
- I can't do it,

25:16.515 --> 25:17.688
- I've gotta,
- I can't do it.

25:17.688 --> 25:19.172
- We're gonna,
we're gonna do this.

25:19.172 --> 25:20.898
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You've got to trust me.

25:20.898 --> 25:22.244
Here, c'mon.
- I, no.

25:22.244 --> 25:23.383
- Be careful with your.
- No, no.

25:23.383 --> 25:24.868
- C'mon, oh, it's okay.
- No!

25:24.868 --> 25:26.697
Oh, no.
- It's okay.

25:26.697 --> 25:27.629
It's okay.

25:31.426 --> 25:33.048
I'm sorry.

25:33.048 --> 25:35.879
I'm sorry, okay, okay,
okay, sit down, it's okay.

25:37.087 --> 25:40.331
I've gotta get you back.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.437
Lay back, lay down, lay down.

25:42.437 --> 25:43.438
Lay down.
- Okay.

25:43.438 --> 25:44.335
- It's okay.
- Okay.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.130
Okay.
- Okay.

25:46.130 --> 25:48.167
Lean back this way.

25:48.167 --> 25:50.100
Lean back this way.

25:50.100 --> 25:51.032
Okay, okay.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.244
Here, lean back,
no, no, no, c'mon.

25:56.244 --> 25:57.590
Come this way, that's it.

25:57.590 --> 25:58.798
- Okay.

25:58.798 --> 26:00.766
I can't.
- Okay, alright.

26:02.112 --> 26:03.216
You're gonna be okay.

26:03.216 --> 26:04.390
- Richard.
- We're gonna be okay.

26:04.390 --> 26:05.322
- Listen to me.

26:05.322 --> 26:07.220
Oh, please, no, no, no.

26:09.395 --> 26:12.191
Rachel crying.
- Gotta get you back.

26:14.124 --> 26:16.540
Gotta get you back.

26:23.961 --> 26:26.861
I'm sorry, baby.
- No, stop, please!

26:26.861 --> 26:28.621
- I'm sorry.
- No, please!

26:28.621 --> 26:31.037
Stop, please stop!

26:31.037 --> 26:33.315
- I'm so sorry.
- Please!

26:33.315 --> 26:36.525
- I'm sorry, alright?

26:36.525 --> 26:38.735
I'm sorry I don't find comfort
in the things that you do.

26:38.735 --> 26:42.048
I'm sorry that I don't
find comfort in that.

26:42.048 --> 26:44.706
- Well exactly what do you
find comfort in, Richard?

26:44.706 --> 26:46.950
Or should I say where
do you find comfort?

26:46.950 --> 26:48.227
'Cause you're never home.

26:48.227 --> 26:50.850
- I am working, Rachel.

26:50.850 --> 26:53.473
I'm trying to make a
living for us, okay?

26:53.473 --> 26:55.821
I'm trying to
support your habit.

26:55.821 --> 26:58.237
- I haven't taken
those in months.

26:58.237 --> 26:59.687
I haven't needed them.

26:59.687 --> 27:00.964
- Oh, right, you
haven't needed them

27:00.964 --> 27:03.000
because of your
new little friend.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.005
Let me show you what I think
of your new little friend.

27:09.179 --> 27:10.111
- You know, maybe you
should start reading it

27:10.111 --> 27:11.353
instead of throwing it around.

27:11.353 --> 27:12.458
You know, before
things get worse.

27:12.458 --> 27:13.597
- How are things supposed to get

27:13.597 --> 27:15.185
any worse that this Rachel, huh?

27:26.610 --> 27:28.750
- It's changing
my life, Richard.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.338
- Stop it.

27:30.338 --> 27:31.511
Just stop it.

27:33.134 --> 27:35.999
If that voodoo crap is
working for you, so be it,

27:35.999 --> 27:39.209
but don't try to get
me onboard with it.

27:39.209 --> 27:40.728
- With what?

27:40.728 --> 27:43.972
With maybe the idea that
there's a plan for everything?

27:43.972 --> 27:45.249
- A plan?
- And a reason, yeah.

27:45.249 --> 27:46.906
- A plan, what is
the plan, Rachel?

27:46.906 --> 27:49.426
Was the great plan for
you to have a miscarriage?

27:49.426 --> 27:51.014
For us to lose our baby?

27:51.014 --> 27:54.017
Was part of his magic plan for
you to get hooked on drugs?

27:54.017 --> 27:56.226
To go into a coma
for six months?

27:57.399 --> 28:00.092
Was part of the plan
to ruin our marriage?

28:02.957 --> 28:04.096
- Is that where we are?

28:06.926 --> 28:10.550
- I don't know where
we are anymore, Rachel.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.455
- Well maybe now we need
that more than ever.

28:27.188 --> 28:28.016
- Look at me.

28:29.984 --> 28:32.572
You do whatever you
feel you have to do,

28:32.572 --> 28:34.367
but you leave me out of it.

28:43.825 --> 28:45.620
Just a little bit further.

28:50.383 --> 28:52.731
- No.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.940
No.
- Just a little further.

28:55.975 --> 29:00.911
- Rich, no.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.714
Oh, God, no, Rich, please.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.373
Please, stop,
please, stop, please,

29:14.373 --> 29:17.031
just for a minute, please stop.

29:56.035 --> 29:57.865
- You need some water.

30:02.007 --> 30:02.835
Here.

30:04.423 --> 30:05.596
Here.

30:31.415 --> 30:34.315
Not exactly what you
had planned, huh?

30:34.315 --> 30:35.143
- What?

30:38.319 --> 30:39.285
- This trip.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.843
Not exactly what
you had in mind.

30:52.609 --> 30:56.820
Hey, hey, hey.

30:57.856 --> 30:58.649
Hey, hey.

31:08.349 --> 31:10.040
Sorry I made you laugh.

31:12.974 --> 31:14.803
- I love it when
you make me laugh.

31:20.637 --> 31:22.294
- You used to
laugh all the time.

31:30.474 --> 31:31.751
- I'm so sorry.

31:34.030 --> 31:35.479
We shouldn't even be out here.

31:35.479 --> 31:36.446
- No, stop.

31:39.380 --> 31:41.071
You have nothing
to apologize for.

31:42.659 --> 31:43.763
I'm the one who should.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.974
- We both have things
we're sorry for.

31:55.741 --> 31:58.640
- We can talk about
all this later.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.539
I've gotta take you a little
deeper into the woods.

32:00.539 --> 32:03.162
- I think we need to
talk about his right now.

32:05.475 --> 32:09.479
- No, we said we'd talk
about it after the trip.

32:10.652 --> 32:14.070
I've gotta get you
deeper into the woods.

32:17.832 --> 32:19.972
Just a little bit further.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.147
You know what?

32:23.907 --> 32:25.633
Here, trust me, okay?

32:28.049 --> 32:29.050
Okay?
- Okay.

32:30.327 --> 32:31.915
Okay.

32:31.915 --> 32:33.365
- It's okay.

32:37.679 --> 32:39.405
I gotta get you back.

32:50.451 --> 32:53.592
Okay, okay, okay, be careful.

32:53.592 --> 32:54.903
Be careful.

32:54.903 --> 32:57.976
Be careful with your leg.
- Hang on.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.287
- Alright, okay.

32:59.287 --> 33:00.081
Okay.

33:03.119 --> 33:04.154
Okay.

33:07.295 --> 33:08.745
We'll be safer here.

33:11.506 --> 33:13.853
This fire's gonna burn out soon.

33:13.853 --> 33:15.165
I gotta get some more wood.

33:17.340 --> 33:19.894
You keep your eyes
open while I'm gone.

33:19.894 --> 33:20.826
Okay?

33:30.939 --> 33:31.906
- More than that,

33:33.080 --> 33:35.496
we rejoice in our sufferings

33:35.496 --> 33:40.501
because we know sufferings
produce endurance,

33:41.605 --> 33:45.782
and endurance
produces character,

33:45.782 --> 33:49.820
and character produces hope.

34:35.728 --> 34:36.556
- Hello?

34:43.219 --> 34:44.081
Hello?

34:46.636 --> 34:47.982
Is anybody here?

34:52.607 --> 34:53.677
We need help.

35:27.815 --> 35:29.196
I got us some more firewood.

35:31.301 --> 35:33.338
It's not much, I'm gonna
have to get more soon,

35:33.338 --> 35:37.997
but, ah, this will last
for a little while.

35:41.311 --> 35:42.209
- I'm so tired.

35:46.351 --> 35:47.559
- I know you are, honey.

35:54.048 --> 35:56.844
Why don't you close your eyes
and rest now that I'm back.

36:05.508 --> 36:06.578
Everything's alright.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.167
We're gonna be okay.

36:11.790 --> 36:12.584
- Are we?

36:14.413 --> 36:17.968
- Yes, somebody had to have
seen the plane go down.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.695
The airport knows
we didn't land.

36:20.695 --> 36:24.043
They've probably already sent
a search party out, okay?

36:24.043 --> 36:26.529
That's why I had to get us
back close to the crash site.

36:27.426 --> 36:28.703
- That's not what I mean.

36:35.883 --> 36:37.540
- Just one thing
at a time, okay?

36:39.058 --> 36:39.887
- And then what?

36:41.268 --> 36:43.235
We just move forward
with the old plan?

36:44.512 --> 36:46.238
Just pretend that
nothing happened?

36:49.517 --> 36:51.209
- We promised we weren't
gonna talk about this

36:51.209 --> 36:52.727
until after we get back.

36:52.727 --> 36:56.904
- After we get back from our
big save our marriage retreat.

37:00.701 --> 37:02.081
Take a look around, Richard.

37:03.635 --> 37:08.018
There's not gonna be some big
private retreat to save us.

37:12.471 --> 37:13.921
There may not be a tomorrow.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.790
- Don't talk like that.

37:20.790 --> 37:23.068
We're not gonna die out
here, not like that.

37:28.349 --> 37:31.249
- We were never guaranteed
growing old and gray together.

37:39.395 --> 37:41.259
- We just gotta get
outta here, okay?

37:42.812 --> 37:46.125
Please, let's just
focus on that.

37:49.405 --> 37:51.614
- We need to talk
about this right now.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.134
- Now?

37:56.550 --> 37:57.930
- This is the perfect time.

38:00.485 --> 38:01.279
Richard,

38:05.213 --> 38:08.286
if I die out here
tonight like this,

38:11.047 --> 38:12.220
I know where I'm going,

38:15.120 --> 38:16.190
but what scares me is

38:17.709 --> 38:18.951
if you die out here,

38:20.988 --> 38:22.300
I know where you're going.

38:23.646 --> 38:27.753
- The whole Heaven and
Hell thing, Rachel, really?

38:27.753 --> 38:29.134
Just no, stop it.

38:31.481 --> 38:33.587
- We've got to talk
about this Rich.

38:35.796 --> 38:37.591
- I'm gonna go get us
some more firewood.

39:24.776 --> 39:27.951
You can have the
house if you want it.

39:29.159 --> 39:30.885
I don't wanna make a
big deal out of this

39:30.885 --> 39:32.611
with lawyers and everything.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.273
Let's just get this
done and over with.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.014
Great timing again, Rachel.

40:04.712 --> 40:06.127
Some mountain retreat.

40:23.904 --> 40:27.459
Richard, I will sign these
if it's what you want.

40:29.081 --> 40:30.635
I don't want the house

40:30.635 --> 40:33.396
or the cars or any of it.

40:33.396 --> 40:35.156
- All I
ask for is a weekend

40:35.156 --> 40:38.263
for both of us to
think this over,

40:38.263 --> 40:41.369
but not a weekend
at home, Rachel.

40:57.593 --> 40:59.180
- We've been praying
that you and your spouse

40:59.180 --> 41:00.837
will be rejuvenated
and re-energized

41:00.837 --> 41:02.252
during this special retreat.

41:03.978 --> 41:06.671
A beautiful mountain getaway
to rekindle your romance.

41:09.052 --> 41:11.779
Great.

41:22.583 --> 41:23.791
This is what you wanted?

41:25.172 --> 41:27.174
This is supposed to
save our marriage?

41:28.486 --> 41:30.488
Is it even worth saving?

41:35.803 --> 41:37.149
What am I doing?

41:39.704 --> 41:41.533
I'm talking to nobody.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.666
- You know I know, right?

42:52.604 --> 42:53.432
- I know.

43:59.913 --> 44:00.672
Oh, yes.

44:01.569 --> 44:03.641
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

44:03.641 --> 44:05.125
Come on.

44:05.125 --> 44:05.953
Come on.

44:08.162 --> 44:09.716
Come on, work for me.

44:12.546 --> 44:13.374
Come on.

44:16.723 --> 44:18.276
God.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.832
Give me something.

44:22.832 --> 44:24.213
- Just give me something to say.

44:26.491 --> 44:28.286
Something I can
do to get through.

44:28.286 --> 44:30.806
God, I don't know what else
I can do at this point.

44:36.915 --> 44:38.676
God, help him say
yes to this trip.

44:41.886 --> 44:43.819
Help me save my
marriage, please, God.

44:46.994 --> 44:48.616
Help me save my marriage.

46:31.858 --> 46:33.445
Are you kidding me?

47:40.443 --> 47:42.169
Baby, I know you're cold.

47:43.170 --> 47:44.068
I found this.

47:46.346 --> 47:48.072
Here, is that better?

48:09.196 --> 48:10.888
- I found it in
your sock drawer.

48:21.105 --> 48:23.279
- Rachel--
- It's, it's alright.

48:25.903 --> 48:27.663
You had already filed.

48:27.663 --> 48:28.940
It was just the next step.

48:31.184 --> 48:32.254
- It's not like that.

48:36.706 --> 48:38.191
Rachel, before we fell asleep,

48:40.469 --> 48:42.160
you said that you--
- I knew.

48:49.202 --> 48:50.755
- I need you to know that, um--

48:50.755 --> 48:52.930
- It's Kristen, right?

48:54.966 --> 48:57.417
- How did you know?

48:59.384 --> 49:02.008
- I don't sleep as
soundly as you think I do.

49:06.944 --> 49:07.806
- Rachel.

49:09.532 --> 49:10.913
- Just, why?

49:13.951 --> 49:15.021
Why would you do it?

49:20.164 --> 49:23.374
We stood in front of
all our family, friends,

49:25.548 --> 49:29.276
we stood in front of
God and, and we promised

49:31.589 --> 49:33.177
to honor each other

49:36.352 --> 49:38.182
in sickness and in health,

49:39.217 --> 49:40.908
in good times and bad.

49:40.908 --> 49:41.909
Do you remember?

49:46.845 --> 49:47.674
- I remember.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.263
- Then why?

49:52.058 --> 49:53.783
- Rachel, I tried to help you.

49:56.131 --> 49:57.649
I did.

49:57.649 --> 49:59.962
And nothing I tried was working.

50:04.656 --> 50:05.692
I got confused, and

50:14.563 --> 50:17.221
I felt like I lost you
the same day we lost Evan.

50:23.951 --> 50:26.126
And when you finally
started getting better,

50:28.404 --> 50:29.854
it had nothing to do with me.

50:32.926 --> 50:34.445
I couldn't even be a part of it

50:36.447 --> 50:41.107
because, because
you had shut me out,

50:41.107 --> 50:46.077
and, ah, it was like all
you had room for was God,

50:49.287 --> 50:51.703
and all that stuff that your
sister was talking about.

50:55.224 --> 50:59.228
- So you were jealous of
my relationship with God?

50:59.228 --> 51:00.057
- No.

51:07.409 --> 51:09.066
I felt like you
had abandoned me.

51:10.101 --> 51:11.309
- I abandoned you?

51:13.932 --> 51:18.005
All those times I was
home hurting and crying,

51:19.317 --> 51:22.079
you were off on business trips.

51:22.079 --> 51:22.907
- I tried.

51:24.840 --> 51:26.635
Rachel, I tried, I did.

51:28.326 --> 51:29.776
I didn't just give up on you.

51:33.780 --> 51:35.644
- So you decided
to hurt me instead?

51:37.059 --> 51:38.750
- Oh, I never meant to hurt you.

51:44.031 --> 51:45.654
I just, I felt numb.

51:51.004 --> 51:53.282
I needed to feel something
more than just pain,

51:55.526 --> 51:57.148
and I needed someone
who could make me feel--

51:57.148 --> 51:58.460
- Do you love her?

52:00.289 --> 52:01.394
- No, I don't.

52:06.985 --> 52:07.814
I don't love her.

52:10.713 --> 52:11.783
- I'm sorry.

52:18.963 --> 52:20.378
- What?

52:20.378 --> 52:23.381
- I'm so
sorry, Richard.

52:26.833 --> 52:28.731
I was hurting so much.

52:34.151 --> 52:35.324
I just shut you out.

52:36.670 --> 52:37.844
I shut everybody out.

52:42.780 --> 52:45.231
By the time I was ready
to open that door again,

52:47.854 --> 52:49.166
you weren't waiting for me.

52:59.210 --> 53:00.832
But do you know who was?

53:00.832 --> 53:03.145
- Don't, don't go there.

53:04.595 --> 53:05.423
- God was.

53:09.358 --> 53:11.705
He was waiting for me like

53:11.705 --> 53:14.674
he's been waiting
for me my whole life.

53:18.988 --> 53:22.302
Rich, when I finally
let him in it was like,

53:25.236 --> 53:29.447
it was like this warm
blanket just covered me,

53:31.035 --> 53:32.726
and I had such a peace

53:38.594 --> 53:40.941
and I want that for you too.

53:42.874 --> 53:46.809
- You're not the one who
should be apologizing.

53:49.156 --> 53:49.985
I...

53:54.507 --> 53:58.718
Rachel, I was confused, I
didn't know what to do, and

54:02.480 --> 54:03.550
I got stupid.

54:08.797 --> 54:10.005
And I got selfish.

54:14.906 --> 54:19.911
My whole life people would
come to me for answers.

54:20.636 --> 54:21.188
Our whole marriage.

54:22.638 --> 54:24.399
You did and you
stopped doing that.

54:35.133 --> 54:37.619
So I just hid from everything.

54:43.832 --> 54:48.802
Rachel, I'm sorry for
the man that I became.

54:58.087 --> 54:59.330
I need you to forgive me.

55:03.265 --> 55:04.853
I know I don't deserve it,

55:06.682 --> 55:10.755
but I need
you to forgive me.

55:18.936 --> 55:20.213
- I forgive you.

55:24.804 --> 55:26.461
I do, I forgive you.

55:29.015 --> 55:29.947
- Oh, baby.

55:44.202 --> 55:45.031
Sorry.

55:46.550 --> 55:47.896
I'm sorry, baby.

55:51.589 --> 55:53.626
- I forgive you for all of it.

55:59.666 --> 56:03.532
There's something I've
gotta have you do first.

56:08.019 --> 56:11.091
I need you to ask
God to forgive you.

56:12.299 --> 56:13.611
- Rachel, don't.

56:15.061 --> 56:17.995
- It took me a long time
to be able to forgive you.

56:21.067 --> 56:22.655
Well, we're running out of time.

56:24.829 --> 56:27.936
I need you to ask
him to forgive you.

56:30.663 --> 56:31.491
Please.

56:36.116 --> 56:38.533
- The fire's dying, I
gotta keep you warm.

56:38.533 --> 56:40.189
I'm gonna take care of you.

56:41.018 --> 56:41.846
I'll be back.

57:42.217 --> 57:43.252
Really Rachel?

57:46.670 --> 57:49.673
- We're going to a marriage
camp run by a church.

57:49.673 --> 57:51.813
- And that book is to blame.

57:51.813 --> 57:53.470
- Something like that.

57:54.816 --> 57:57.197
Richard, I'm just
looking for answers.

57:58.475 --> 57:59.752
- Fire and brimstone?

57:59.752 --> 58:01.650
Demons, devils?

58:01.650 --> 58:03.203
What does that have to
do with our marriage?

58:04.895 --> 58:06.172
- I guess we'll find out.

58:12.419 --> 58:14.560
- Can you at least have
got a later flight?

59:19.417 --> 59:20.418
I got you a present.

59:22.351 --> 59:24.768
I figured it might
help past the time

59:24.768 --> 59:25.907
till we get outta here.

59:43.787 --> 59:47.135
Rachel, there's
something I need to say.

59:51.588 --> 59:52.450
I lied.

59:57.179 --> 59:58.146
I was jealous.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.531
I still am.

01:00:11.711 --> 01:00:14.680
Help me understand how
I'm supposed to believe

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.613
in a God that can let
stuff like this happen

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.579
to people like us?

01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:22.722
We don't even have
water anymore.

01:00:22.722 --> 01:00:24.344
There's fuel leaking
from the plane

01:00:24.344 --> 01:00:26.001
into our only water supply.

01:00:29.315 --> 01:00:31.110
- I don't have
many answers, Rich.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.875
I only know when I
started surrounding

01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:39.256
to the idea that God's,

01:00:41.327 --> 01:00:42.811
was in control of everything,

01:00:44.088 --> 01:00:46.125
the good and the bad,

01:00:48.748 --> 01:00:51.130
I started feeling such a peace.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.827
There's something so
beautiful in that.

01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:02.659
- How?

01:01:03.832 --> 01:01:06.214
Rachel that makes
no sense to me.

01:01:06.214 --> 01:01:09.079
- I just, I kept reading,

01:01:12.772 --> 01:01:14.256
and it started to make sense.

01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:17.225
How much God loves us.

01:01:18.502 --> 01:01:22.886
He really does.

01:01:22.886 --> 01:01:24.163
I just had to let go.

01:01:27.994 --> 01:01:29.409
- Something made you better,

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.380
and even if I
wasn't a part of it,

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.318
I'm glad that it worked, baby.

01:01:41.318 --> 01:01:44.493
- Rich, I don't know how
much longer I can hold on.

01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:47.704
- Rachel, I'm begging you,
stop talking like that.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:48.981
We're gonna get outta here.

01:01:51.328 --> 01:01:53.399
- Richard, you've
got stop running.

01:01:58.404 --> 01:01:59.439
I'm getting worse,

01:02:01.372 --> 01:02:02.201
but it's okay.

01:02:07.793 --> 01:02:10.796
Everything changed
for me two months ago.

01:02:10.796 --> 01:02:15.801
I tried to tell you.

01:02:18.631 --> 01:02:20.081
I messed it all up.

01:02:22.359 --> 01:02:25.742
You got angry and told me to
leave you out of it, and...

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.646
What if I die?

01:02:33.646 --> 01:02:38.202
Baby if I die out
here, it's okay.

01:02:39.928 --> 01:02:41.136
- It's not okay with me.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:45.969
Rachel, I actually feel like

01:02:45.969 --> 01:02:50.767
we, we can make this work.

01:02:54.011 --> 01:02:56.220
If you do die out here,

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.291
I will never forgive your God.

01:03:05.505 --> 01:03:07.024
I need to find us some shelter.

01:03:11.201 --> 01:03:13.306
- You need to find
something else.

01:03:20.969 --> 01:03:23.420
- Rachel, I've always
believed in what I can see.

01:03:26.975 --> 01:03:27.804
Look around us.

01:03:31.117 --> 01:03:32.429
All this is just pain.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.849
What's left to believe in?

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:40.264
- Something more.

01:03:42.508 --> 01:03:43.854
Something better.

01:03:47.064 --> 01:03:47.893
- I can't.

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:51.586
- Can't or won't?

01:04:31.488 --> 01:04:33.559
- I have no room.

01:04:34.767 --> 01:04:36.631
- I know, it's a
little tight in here.

01:04:36.631 --> 01:04:39.220
He said it's only going to
be for a couple of hours.

01:04:40.152 --> 01:04:41.670
Don't worry, it's gonna be fun.

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.776
- Huh, yeah.

01:04:43.776 --> 01:04:45.226
Fun, if you consider
getting beat

01:04:45.226 --> 01:04:46.434
over the head by a Bible fun.

01:04:46.434 --> 01:04:47.849
- Yeah, it's not
gonna be like that.

01:04:47.849 --> 01:04:49.333
- How do you know that Rachel?

01:04:49.333 --> 01:04:50.887
How do you know this is not
gonna be some kind of a cult?

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:51.957
- It's not a cult.

01:04:51.957 --> 01:04:53.337
- How do you know?

01:04:53.337 --> 01:04:55.167
There's gonna be
some old, white guy

01:04:55.167 --> 01:04:58.722
with a beard singing Kumbaya
and smoking a peace pipe,

01:04:58.722 --> 01:05:00.413
talking about peace and love.

01:05:00.413 --> 01:05:03.106
- It's not 1965 Richard.

01:05:03.106 --> 01:05:04.831
Give it a chance.

01:05:04.831 --> 01:05:05.971
- I'll give it a chance.

01:05:05.971 --> 01:05:06.833
- Yeah.

01:05:09.595 --> 01:05:12.701
Richard, honestly, it's
gonna be good for us.

01:05:12.701 --> 01:05:14.151
It'll give us some time away.

01:05:15.532 --> 01:05:18.397
You know, without the
distractions of home, work.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.469
It might really do us some good.

01:05:24.058 --> 01:05:26.025
- What his name?

01:05:26.025 --> 01:05:28.821
- Hey, Darren, how
much longer before.

01:05:28.821 --> 01:05:30.374
- What was that?

01:05:33.136 --> 01:05:35.414
- It's just some rough air.

01:05:35.414 --> 01:05:36.933
- Darren, hey.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:37.864
How much longer before we.

01:05:37.864 --> 01:05:39.521
- Oh, Richard.
- Hold on!

01:05:49.255 --> 01:05:50.601
She asked you to help her.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.433
She called out to you for help,

01:05:55.848 --> 01:05:57.677
and you let this happen?

01:06:13.279 --> 01:06:18.008
- Oh, God.

01:06:18.008 --> 01:06:20.873
I'm so ready for
the pain to be over.

01:06:29.123 --> 01:06:30.883
I just wanna go home.

01:06:31.918 --> 01:06:36.923
I just wanna go home.

01:06:44.586 --> 01:06:45.794
Please help Rich.

01:06:48.383 --> 01:06:50.040
Please help Rich.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.456
- Rachel this is not gonna work.

01:06:52.456 --> 01:06:54.044
Too many fumes in the plane,

01:06:55.252 --> 01:06:56.702
and the storm's gonna be big.

01:06:58.152 --> 01:06:59.946
I found a cave earlier.

01:06:59.946 --> 01:07:01.741
It's further away,
but we're gonna have

01:07:01.741 --> 01:07:03.433
to get you there instead.

01:07:10.474 --> 01:07:11.820
- Rich, I can't.

01:07:37.156 --> 01:07:38.019
- What can I do?

01:07:42.506 --> 01:07:44.267
Can I make you more comfortable?

01:07:46.165 --> 01:07:47.442
- Can you hold me?

01:07:47.442 --> 01:07:48.616
Just hold me.

01:08:16.402 --> 01:08:18.508
Will you read this to me?

01:08:18.508 --> 01:08:19.404
Read to me?

01:08:21.683 --> 01:08:22.581
Read to me?

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.620
- Let not your
heart be troubled.

01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:33.694
Believe in God,
believe also in me.

01:08:37.665 --> 01:08:39.908
In my father's house
there are many mansions.

01:08:41.772 --> 01:08:43.877
If it were not so, I
would have told you.

01:08:46.812 --> 01:08:48.537
I go to prepare a place for you.

01:08:51.541 --> 01:08:53.542
And if I go and prepare
a place for you,

01:08:55.441 --> 01:08:59.203
I will come again and
receive you unto myself.

01:09:03.932 --> 01:09:08.937
The way I am ye may be also.

01:09:23.124 --> 01:09:24.435
It worked, baby.

01:09:27.818 --> 01:09:28.888
Your trip worked.

01:09:32.237 --> 01:09:34.687
I know now I cannot
live without you.

01:09:44.421 --> 01:09:48.252
I didn't know how to
say goodbye to Evan.

01:09:48.252 --> 01:09:51.428
Now how am I gonna
say goodbye to you?

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.195
I've loved you since
I was 14 years old.

01:10:06.063 --> 01:10:09.239
So many things I'm gonna
miss about you, baby.

01:10:13.623 --> 01:10:17.868
The way you smile when you
catch me looking at you.

01:10:19.767 --> 01:10:21.872
The way you sing and
dance with the radio.

01:10:26.152 --> 01:10:29.570
I'm gonna miss talking about
building a family together.

01:10:36.577 --> 01:10:37.750
- I miss Evan.

01:11:06.434 --> 01:11:07.953
- I wanted a little boy.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:15.167
I wanted to coach
him in baseball.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.448
I'm sorry I didn't
talk more about it

01:11:20.448 --> 01:11:22.001
after we lost him, baby.

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:26.696
I just, I just didn't
think it would help.

01:11:30.424 --> 01:11:34.462
Please, please, don't think I
didn't love him because I did.

01:11:34.462 --> 01:11:35.291
I do.

01:11:38.949 --> 01:11:40.054
- I love you.

01:11:45.059 --> 01:11:46.129
- I love you.

01:11:51.997 --> 01:11:53.067
- I see Evan.

01:12:01.075 --> 01:12:02.179
- Rachel, no.

01:12:03.215 --> 01:12:04.665
Don't you leave me.

01:12:07.046 --> 01:12:08.289
Don't you leave me.

01:12:10.705 --> 01:12:11.706
Baby, don't.

01:12:12.845 --> 01:12:15.676
I don't wanna live without you.

01:12:15.676 --> 01:12:16.504
Baby, please.

01:12:20.957 --> 01:12:21.785
Baby.

01:12:35.834 --> 01:12:38.388
I'm gonna make you comfortable.

01:12:48.467 --> 01:12:49.330
No.

01:12:51.436 --> 01:12:52.264
No, baby.

01:12:53.472 --> 01:12:54.300
I'm sorry.

01:12:57.683 --> 01:12:58.477
Why?

01:13:05.898 --> 01:13:07.762
What kind of a God are you?

01:13:11.214 --> 01:13:12.353
I hate you!

01:13:14.182 --> 01:13:15.287

01:13:17.634 --> 01:13:18.532
You hear me?

01:13:21.707 --> 01:13:23.640
She said she loved you,

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.367
and this is what you do?

01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:29.335
And this is how you treat her?

01:14:03.369 --> 01:14:04.543
Damn you!

01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:33.839
I'll come back for you.

therefore, or die,

we are the Lord's.

I got you a present.

01:22:47.307 --> 01:22:49.033
I thought it might
help past the time

01:22:50.344 --> 01:22:52.001
till we get out of here.

01:23:00.078 --> 01:23:01.321

01:23:12.228 --> 01:23:15.680
Please, just in my heart.

01:23:30.108 --> 01:23:32.455
I don't know how to do this.

01:23:35.527 --> 01:23:40.532
I don't know how to do
anything anymore,

01:23:41.395 --> 01:23:43.777
but I ask you to forgive me.

01:23:46.159 --> 01:23:47.022
I'm sorry.

01:23:47.988 --> 01:23:49.541
Dear God, I'm sorry.

01:23:54.443 --> 01:23:56.548
I need you to forgive me.

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.416
I, I need you in my live.

01:24:14.601 --> 01:24:16.672
I wanna see Rachel again.

01:24:18.674 --> 01:24:23.679
And I wanna see Evan.

01:24:29.098 --> 01:24:31.169
And, and I wanna see you.

01:26:00.293 --> 01:26:02.018
- We found the plane.

01:26:10.095 --> 01:26:12.167
- God has a
way of waking us up.

01:26:13.375 --> 01:26:14.479
Of opening our eyes.

01:26:16.619 --> 01:26:18.034
Sometimes he does it subtly,

01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.555
sometimes it's more dramatic.

01:26:24.455 --> 01:26:26.871
What happened out there
changed my life forever.

01:26:29.218 --> 01:26:30.668
Rachel dying on impact,

01:26:31.979 --> 01:26:34.189
but coming to me when
I needed her the most.

01:26:37.744 --> 01:26:39.953
I don't have her anymore,

01:26:39.953 --> 01:26:41.713
and I never got to hold my son,

01:26:43.543 --> 01:26:46.822
but now thanks to Rachel,

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:49.756
I know I'm gonna see her again.

01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:52.966
I know that I'm
finally gonna be able

01:26:52.966 --> 01:26:55.589
to hold Evan and
to see his face.

01:26:58.558 --> 01:27:01.423
It's not because I was
able to survive the crash

01:27:01.423 --> 01:27:05.116
or the storm or my
own anger and hatred,

01:27:06.876 --> 01:27:08.361
it's because Jesus saved me,

01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:12.399
and he didn't just save
me from the situation,

01:27:14.056 --> 01:27:16.748
he saved me from me.

01:27:19.682 --> 01:27:20.856
Life can get turbulent,

01:27:22.478 --> 01:27:24.239
but you can make it through.

01:27:26.137 --> 01:27:27.587
That's what Rachel taught me,

01:27:28.553 --> 01:27:29.968
and that's what God gave me,

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:33.524
and I owe them both my life.
