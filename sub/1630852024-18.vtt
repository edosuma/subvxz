WEBVTT

00:02.698 --> 00:05.831
[Jughead]
The signs when they began
were easily explained.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.268
[croaking]

00:07.311 --> 00:10.184
Frogs escaping
from the biology lab.

00:10.227 --> 00:13.056
[croaking]

00:13.100 --> 00:15.798
-[buzzing]
-And swarming flies.

00:15.841 --> 00:18.105
[buzzing]

00:18.148 --> 00:21.673
And children sent home
from school for having lice
in their hair.

00:23.893 --> 00:28.028
So despite these omens
and portents,
daily life continued.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.640
What can I do for you, Toni?

00:31.683 --> 00:35.078
Okay, I know
it's super short notice,

00:35.122 --> 00:37.515
but Fangs and I set a date
for the wedding.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.256
Really?

00:39.300 --> 00:41.215
-Congratulations!
-Thanks!

00:41.258 --> 00:43.173
We're really excited.

00:43.217 --> 00:44.392
And let me guess,
you wanna book
one of our champagne suites,

00:44.435 --> 00:45.436
for the big night?

00:46.698 --> 00:49.179
Actually, we were
kind of hoping

00:49.223 --> 00:55.794
that you could help organize
and facilitate the wedding.

00:55.838 --> 00:59.668
Oh. Like in a party planner
kind of way?

00:59.711 --> 01:03.672
I know it's super last minute,
but we need a miracle worker.

01:03.715 --> 01:06.109
And you're literally
the only person I know
that could pull this off.

01:07.676 --> 01:09.069
Absolutely.

01:09.112 --> 01:11.941
I'd be honored
to plan your party.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.900
[Archie] Fangs asked me to be
a groomsman at his wedding.

01:14.944 --> 01:17.338
I said, "I'm in,
as long as I don't have
to give a speech

01:17.381 --> 01:19.688
-or plan a bachelor party."
-[chuckles]

01:19.731 --> 01:22.952
I can't believe it.

01:22.995 --> 01:25.694
I'd understand it
if you wanted to take a pass.

01:25.737 --> 01:28.697
No, Archie, I'm really happy
for Toni and Fangs.

01:30.307 --> 01:32.048
And I would love
to get dressed up

01:32.092 --> 01:35.834
and do something fun
after SlaughterCon.

01:35.878 --> 01:38.010
Yeah. A wedding
would be a good thing

01:38.054 --> 01:40.926
for everyone in the town.

01:40.970 --> 01:43.668
We need something good
to talk about, to celebrate.

01:43.712 --> 01:44.626
Mm.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.152
[typing]

01:51.502 --> 01:53.765
Jughead, this is really cool.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.898
But also really creepy.

01:55.941 --> 01:58.944
I feel
like I'm gonna have nightmares
about La Llorona now.

01:58.988 --> 01:59.989
Sorry.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.686
No. No, no, no, I love it.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.558
But, um,

02:03.601 --> 02:06.648
where is this sudden
burst of creativity
coming from?

02:06.691 --> 02:09.172
You know those voices
that I've been hearing
in my head?

02:09.216 --> 02:11.043
I just started riffing
off them.

02:11.087 --> 02:14.308
And get this, the more I write,
the more the voices subside.

02:14.351 --> 02:17.311
Well, that's a relief.

02:17.354 --> 02:22.577
Does that mean you can
come out of the bunker?

02:22.620 --> 02:25.362
Maybe go to Toni
and Fangs' wedding?

02:26.015 --> 02:26.842
Uh...

02:28.496 --> 02:29.584
I just--

02:29.627 --> 02:31.368
I don't know if I'm ready yet.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.370
When I go back up there,
the voices come back

02:33.414 --> 02:36.895
and it's that same cacophony
again.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.984
But I don't want you to go
dateless to the wedding.

02:39.028 --> 02:41.726
No, no, no, no.
Don't worry about that.

02:41.770 --> 02:42.684
I just...

02:43.859 --> 02:45.034
want you to get better.

02:47.297 --> 02:50.518
I want you to be okay.

02:50.561 --> 02:54.435
I am. I think I'm finally
recovering.

02:54.478 --> 02:58.047
[sighs in relief]
Then that's all that matters.

03:05.228 --> 03:09.189
[Jughead]
Little did any of us know
that frogs, flies and lice

03:09.232 --> 03:13.280
were mere preludes
to Percival's symphony
of Biblical horrors.

03:18.546 --> 03:21.810
[chanting in other language]

03:22.811 --> 03:25.988
[repeating chant]

03:26.031 --> 03:27.859
[repeating chant]

03:31.907 --> 03:34.257
[Veronica] I'm glad
Jughead's doing better.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.737
Me, too. [sighs]

03:35.780 --> 03:37.739
Not enough to rejoin society,

03:37.782 --> 03:40.263
but baby steps.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.351
[Veronica] Hmm.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.312
How are you doing?

03:46.313 --> 03:48.228
Am I getting the sense

03:48.271 --> 03:50.969
that you are
slightly less enthused
about Toni's wedding

03:51.013 --> 03:53.102
than you were
about SlaughterCon?

03:53.145 --> 03:54.973
[chuckles]

03:55.017 --> 03:57.193
It's... It's not the wedding.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.064
I'm thrilled
for Toni and Fangs.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.153
But...

04:02.764 --> 04:04.244
[exhales sharply]

04:04.287 --> 04:07.377
I used to be the she-wolf
of Wall Street, Tabitha,

04:07.421 --> 04:11.599
and now somehow
I'm a glorified party planner.

04:11.642 --> 04:15.167
And instead of living
in New York,
I'm here in Riverdale

04:15.211 --> 04:16.734
with no social life,

04:16.778 --> 04:17.996
no lover...

04:19.433 --> 04:20.434
Nothing.

04:23.654 --> 04:24.786
How did this happen?

04:24.829 --> 04:26.701
Listen... [scoffs]

04:26.744 --> 04:28.877
According to my five-year plan,
I should have franchised Pop's

04:28.920 --> 04:31.227
and taken it national by now.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.709
But you are a lot more
than a party planner.

04:34.752 --> 04:38.408
And we all know that when you
set your mind to something,

04:38.452 --> 04:41.019
there's nothing you can't do.

04:41.063 --> 04:43.413
Except find a day
for this wedding.

04:44.632 --> 04:45.720
[both chuckle]

04:48.157 --> 04:51.987
God, I just miss sharing
my heart with someone.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.946
My love.

04:54.990 --> 04:55.904
-[intercom buzzes]
-[manover intercom]
Uh, Ms. Lodge,

04:55.947 --> 04:57.471
we've got a problem.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.211
There's something wrong
with the plumbing.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.694
[Jughead] And it wasn't
just at the casino.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.174
[eerie music playing]

05:09.221 --> 05:11.354
It was happening all over town.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.401
[Toni] What is that, rust?

05:14.444 --> 05:15.967
I don't know.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.360
Something must be messed up
with the pipes.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.970
[knocking at door]

05:19.014 --> 05:20.537
[Toni] Well, Kevin,

05:20.581 --> 05:23.714
what's so important
you couldn't call or text?

05:23.758 --> 05:26.413
I just wanted to come
and tell you in person

05:26.456 --> 05:29.111
that I'm not gonna fight
for custody of Baby Anthony
anymore.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.896
I'm dropping the case.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.158
What made you change your mind?

05:35.335 --> 05:38.338
You're his mother, Toni.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.688
And you're his father,
his real father, Fangs.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.429
Not me.

05:42.472 --> 05:45.693
I just don't wanna cause
your Baby Anthony
anymore distress

05:45.736 --> 05:48.957
than I already have.
So just please forgive me.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.567
[cell phone ringing]

05:50.611 --> 05:52.264
What do you want, Percival?

05:52.308 --> 05:55.746
I want you to call off
this ill-advised strike.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.401
Your crew must be feeling
the pinch by now.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.185
End their torment, Archie.

06:00.229 --> 06:02.274
Let them get back
to work on my railroad.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.407
It's not up to me.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.104
The crew's holding firm,
it's their choice.

06:06.148 --> 06:10.979
See, Archie, even now,
you refuse to see the signs.

06:11.022 --> 06:13.373
Reptiles and insects
are swarming.

06:13.416 --> 06:16.332
It always starts with God's
lowliest creatures.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.160
What are you
even talking about?

06:18.203 --> 06:20.945
You have no idea
what forces are at play here,
do you?

06:20.989 --> 06:23.252
Oh, well, you will, soon.

06:23.295 --> 06:26.298
And then, your crew
will be begging
to get back to work for me.

06:26.342 --> 06:31.216
In the meantime,
might I suggest
you tune in to the news?

06:31.260 --> 06:33.131
[reporter] We repeat,
somehow, overnight,

06:33.175 --> 06:35.830
Sweetwater River
has turned blood red.

06:35.873 --> 06:40.661
Scientists are at a loss
to explain this stunning,
dare I say, apocalyptic event.

06:40.704 --> 06:43.054
[Archie] It's weird.
Percival basically insinuated

06:43.098 --> 06:45.709
that he was responsible
for what happened
at Sweetwater River.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.972
How could that be possible?

06:48.016 --> 06:49.844
He's got the power
of persuasion, yes.

06:49.887 --> 06:53.456
And other parlor tricks,
but turning an entire river red

06:53.500 --> 06:56.590
would mean he's a sorcerer
of tremendous ability
and skill.

06:56.633 --> 07:01.464
Well, he also said
there are other signs
and forces at play.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.857
-What signs?
-[Archie] I don't know.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.729
Something about insects
and snakes.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.252
But the call was a threat.

07:07.296 --> 07:10.168
Playing devil's advocate,
which is what I do best,

07:10.212 --> 07:13.258
I suggest we deal
with our personal situation

07:13.302 --> 07:15.043
immediately and decisively.

07:15.086 --> 07:16.131
How?

07:16.174 --> 07:17.698
Simple, we kill him.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.136
I'll do the deed myself
with my pyrokinesis.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.662
[exhales] Oh, my God. Guys,
we've all thought about it.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.490
And if we kill Percival,

07:27.534 --> 07:29.927
the battle between good
and evil will already be lost.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.451
[scoffs]

07:31.494 --> 07:33.061
Look, Percival wants to break
the strike.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.324
Only, instead of bringing in
gun thugs,

07:35.367 --> 07:37.935
he's using scare tactics
and intimidation.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.502
So, then,
we need to stay strong.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.286
We have a meeting
with the workers tomorrow.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.897
We'll make sure
that they feel supported.

07:42.940 --> 07:45.247
That said,
until we know more,

07:45.290 --> 07:47.815
should we maybe tell Toni
to wait a beat on her wedding?

07:47.858 --> 07:51.079
No. A wedding will remind
everyone in Riverdale
what they're fighting for.

07:51.122 --> 07:53.168
A better tomorrow
for our families.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.083
Percival's trying to
divide the town.

07:55.126 --> 07:57.346
Toni and Fangs
will help bring it together.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.004
-[water splashing]
-[footsteps approaching]

08:08.575 --> 08:10.533
[eerie music playing]

08:26.767 --> 08:28.203
[music intensifies]

08:36.733 --> 08:39.780
[Jughead] I didn't sleep
well last night,
vivid nightmares.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.564
And now something's missing.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.914
The ghost story I wrote
about La Llorona.

08:43.958 --> 08:46.613
Could someone have snuck
into the bunker and stolen it?

08:46.656 --> 08:48.658
[eerie whispers]

08:50.051 --> 08:51.531
The strike is breaking us.

08:51.574 --> 08:54.359
Some of us heard
that Percival might be open

08:54.403 --> 08:56.318
to renegotiating our contracts
and salary.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.929
No, guys, look,
under no circumstances

08:58.973 --> 09:01.149
can we go back
to work for Percival now.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.368
We've gotta keep thinking
long term.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.414
We're gaining momentum.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.808
And, Percival, he's a snake.

09:07.851 --> 09:11.768
We are fighting for the future.

09:11.812 --> 09:14.249
You guys just need to hang on
a little bit longer.

09:15.642 --> 09:16.556
Can you do that?

09:23.911 --> 09:25.565
Agent Lin, would you do me
a favor

09:25.608 --> 09:27.218
and get me a few Bibles?

09:27.262 --> 09:30.134
And any other religious books
you can track down.

09:30.178 --> 09:33.137
Basically holy texts
that mention...

09:33.181 --> 09:35.879
plagues, curses, revelations.

09:35.923 --> 09:39.361
Sure... I didn't realize
you are a religious person.

09:39.404 --> 09:42.712
I'm not, uh, but it's research
for a possible case.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.409
Hopefully, I'm wrong,
and it's nothing.

09:46.411 --> 09:49.414
Do you think it's crazy,
that we're planning a wedding

09:49.458 --> 09:51.982
while the sword of Damocles
hangs over all of us?

09:52.026 --> 09:55.638
We are fighting a battle
on multiple fronts,

09:55.682 --> 09:57.074
but it's just as important

09:57.118 --> 09:59.555
for life to continue
during wartime.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.297
Because otherwise,
what are we fighting for?

10:04.081 --> 10:05.648
Good question.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.084
You're fighting for Jughead

10:07.128 --> 10:09.609
-and your family business.
-Mm-hmm.

10:09.652 --> 10:12.133
Betty and Archie
are fighting for each other.

10:12.176 --> 10:15.310
Toni and Fangs are fighting
for Anthony.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.747
What exactly am I fighting for?

10:18.835 --> 10:21.359
Trust me, there's something.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.667
There's a reason
you stayed in Riverdale.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.888
[Cheryl] That was Toni.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.194
Something wrong?

10:32.370 --> 10:34.677
She...

10:34.721 --> 10:36.984
asked me to officiate her
and Fangs' wedding.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.030
And what did you say?

10:40.857 --> 10:41.858
I said yes.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.470
That was a really nice thing
to do.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.086
You know what, Heather?

10:54.088 --> 10:56.568
It is nice.

10:56.612 --> 11:00.007
And I am going to give Toni
the best wedding gift ever.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.314
Which is what?

11:03.358 --> 11:05.186
I'm going to kill Percival
for her.

11:06.883 --> 11:09.320
[chanting in other language]

11:12.584 --> 11:13.977
[repeating chant]

11:16.371 --> 11:17.764
[repeating chant]

11:20.201 --> 11:21.245
[woman] Oh, my God!

11:21.289 --> 11:23.291
[buzzing]

11:23.334 --> 11:24.945
What the hell happened
to the food?

11:26.163 --> 11:27.382
I don't understand.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.427
Me neither.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.778
Ten minutes ago,
the spread was to die for.

I guess.

24:34.298 --> 24:36.605

with Toni and Fangs
getting married

24:36.649 --> 24:38.085

24:38.912 --> 24:40.653
lonely, unwanted...

24:40.696 --> 24:41.915

24:44.613 --> 24:46.049

24:48.443 --> 24:51.490
Well, I've got something that
will distract you,
if not cheer you up.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.927

unpack some of
the glorious new treasures

24:53.970 --> 24:55.406

a scarlet-colored beast,

25:10.596 --> 25:12.162
full of blasphemy.

25:12.206 --> 25:15.209
And that woman
was Babylon the Great,

25:15.252 --> 25:18.734
mother of all destruction
and abomination.

25:18.778 --> 25:21.781
You are that woman, Betty.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.793
[Jughead] And lo,
it came to pass

25:33.836 --> 25:36.796
on the third day,
while Archie Andrews
worked the railway

25:36.839 --> 25:39.973
-to spare his crew
anymore suffering...
-[grunting]

25:40.016 --> 25:42.584

worked the phones,

25:42.628 --> 25:46.066

for Toni's wedding...

25:46.109 --> 25:49.199
and Toni and Fangs worked
on their wedding vows...

25:51.637 --> 25:56.293
a terrible darkness
fell over the town
of Riverdale...

25:57.338 --> 25:58.774
in the middle of the day.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.820
[suspenseful music playing]

26:04.040 --> 26:05.868
[panting]

26:11.352 --> 26:15.965
And now, surprise eclipses
are happening in Riverdale.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.401
Archie's working the railway,

26:17.445 --> 26:18.838
and the plagues
are still coming.

26:18.881 --> 26:20.753
So clearly, Percival
has another agenda.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.755
Percival is getting
ready for war,

26:22.798 --> 26:24.800
-Betty.
-What does that mean?

26:24.844 --> 26:27.629
He just received
a shipment of weaponry.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.326
Crossbows from the Crusades,

26:29.370 --> 26:31.328
uh, sabers from the Civil War,

26:31.372 --> 26:33.504
torture racks from
the Spanish Inquisition,

26:33.548 --> 26:35.637

the Harlot of Babylon,

26:35.681 --> 26:37.465

from ancient Saxony.

26:37.508 --> 26:40.990
Hold on. Go, go back to the...
The stockade part?

26:41.034 --> 26:43.166
Yeah, it's a torture device.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.907
Kept rambling about
how he wants

26:44.951 --> 26:47.780
to put the Harlot of Babylon
exactly where she belongs.

26:47.823 --> 26:51.479
On display for when the walls
come tumbling down.

26:51.522 --> 26:52.698
[bell dinging]

26:54.351 --> 26:55.788

26:55.831 --> 26:57.616
Always a pleasure
to have visitors in my shop.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.226
You want to imprison me, right?

26:59.269 --> 27:01.228
[door closes]

27:01.271 --> 27:04.710
Do you want to put me
in that stockade?
Will that satisfy you?

27:04.753 --> 27:06.102
And why on Earth
would I want that?

27:10.759 --> 27:13.196
I had a-- a flash.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.809
A memory, a dream.
I don't know what it was.

27:16.852 --> 27:20.247
A man calling me
the Harlot of Babylon,

27:20.290 --> 27:24.686
and asking me to join his side
in a coming war.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.862
I didn't understand it.
I still don't understand it.

27:26.906 --> 27:30.605
But yours is the only war
that I'm aware of, currently.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.086
So if you want
Riverdale's harlot on display,

27:33.129 --> 27:35.436
I guess that would be me.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.917
So put me in
your stockade, Percival,

27:37.960 --> 27:40.441
if that will finally stop
the plagues.

27:40.484 --> 27:45.402
[chuckling] Now I understand.

27:45.446 --> 27:48.144
Mr. Keller has betrayed me.

27:48.188 --> 27:50.581
But no, Ms. Cooper,
it's not you that I want.

27:50.625 --> 27:53.454
At least, not only you.

27:53.497 --> 27:54.673
Then what?

27:56.326 --> 27:58.720
Well, I would have thought
that was rather obvious.

28:00.461 --> 28:02.245
[Toni] He wants
Baby Anthony?

28:02.289 --> 28:03.986
Over my dead body.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.771
Well, of course we're not going
to give him Baby Anthony.

28:05.814 --> 28:08.991
What? Does he want Anthony
for some crazy occult ritual?

28:09.035 --> 28:11.124
Hmm, probably.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.603
If that man comes near
my child, I'm going to rip
his larynx out.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.780
Time is not on our side.

28:14.823 --> 28:17.347
Percival's threatened
to call down more plagues

28:17.391 --> 28:20.002
if we don't hand over
Baby Anthony by sundown.

28:20.046 --> 28:21.787
I'm almost afraid to ask,

28:21.830 --> 28:24.354
but which plagues are left?

28:24.398 --> 28:28.228
Earthquakes, fire from the sky,
pestilence,

28:28.271 --> 28:30.099
hail, and...

28:30.143 --> 28:31.535
death of the firstborn.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.276
Oh, my, God.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.974
And Baby Anthony is not
the only thing that he wants.

28:35.017 --> 28:38.499
He wants to put me in the
Harlot of Babylon's stockade.

28:39.413 --> 28:40.631
Stockade?

28:43.765 --> 28:44.984
What?

28:45.027 --> 28:46.594
Check the Maleficarum,
page 352.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.427
Is this what
you're talking about?

28:53.470 --> 28:54.820
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that's it.

28:54.863 --> 28:57.083
Okay, that's good news.

28:57.126 --> 28:59.476
This is the
Stockade of Legarius.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.217
According to the Maleficarum,

29:01.261 --> 29:04.003
the Stockade of Legarius
is practically inescapable.

29:04.046 --> 29:05.744
It renders its prisoners
powerless.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.180
Would that include Percival?

29:07.223 --> 29:08.616
Sure, if we can get him
into it.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.574
Turning his torture device
against him.

29:10.618 --> 29:11.575

my father favored.

out in his shop, happily
polishing his antiques,

29:20.323 --> 29:22.021
waiting for me to deliver
Baby Anthony.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.849
Well, if we move fast enough,

29:23.892 --> 29:27.026

able to catch him by surprise.
