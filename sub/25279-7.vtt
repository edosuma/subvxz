WEBVTT

00:07.424 --> 00:09.801
[sighs] Morning, Mr. Bennett.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.137
Good morning, Mrs. Bennett.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.139
[chuckles]

00:15.056 --> 00:16.891
Good morning, other Mr. Bennett.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.560
Good morning.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.103
[chuckles]

00:21.855 --> 00:22.981
[exhales]

00:24.315 --> 00:27.569
I always knew you'd wake up next to me
after your wedding night.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.447
Well, the morning sickness is back.

00:32.323 --> 00:35.285
You wouldn't be the first person
to wake up next to Rooster and throw up.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.536
[chuckles]

00:37.662 --> 00:39.039
How'd the newlyweds sleep?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.207
I always dreamed, on my wedding night,

00:41.291 --> 00:44.836
I'd be lulled to sleep by crashing waves
on an exotic island.

00:44.919 --> 00:49.215
But Dale's sleep apnea machine
was surprisingly soothing.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.971
-I can't believe we're married.
-[chuckles]

00:55.472 --> 00:58.099
If you divorce me, I get half your stuff.

00:58.808 --> 01:01.853
It is all there in that duffel bag,
so have at it.

01:03.313 --> 01:07.567
Can I get everyone's attention?
Highway 145 is open.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.861
The fire's been contained there.

01:09.944 --> 01:12.238
If you live north of there,
it's safe to go home.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.490
Thank God.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.201
-About time.
-Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.622
First time I've been in school
for three consecutive days.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.417
Please go through your spaces.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.003
Make sure you don't leave anything behind.

01:27.629 --> 01:32.801
And if anybody sees a car key that says
"Garrison Police," please let me know.

01:36.095 --> 01:39.265
All right.
Let's go see if the house burned down.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.436
Now I know how you guys felt every time
you left us home alone.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.438
It's gonna be fine.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.940
And if it did burn down,

01:47.649 --> 01:50.860
then Dad won't be able to say,
"My roof, my rules."

01:52.570 --> 01:54.697
-My rubble, my rules.
-[Abby chuckles]

01:56.241 --> 01:58.284
Pull the truck around. We can load it.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.369
Yep. You got it.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.495
[imitates whip]

02:01.162 --> 02:02.247
So it starts.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.500
-Punch him, Colt.
-You got it.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.460
[chuckles]

02:08.128 --> 02:10.964
I'd hit you in the balls,
but those are gone.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.590
All right. Take this.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.225
Part of me doesn't wanna leave.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.019
As long as we're here,
there's a chance the ranch is okay.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.315
Either there's no house
or we go back to the way things were.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.734
I'm not sure which is scarier.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.030
You got a second?

02:36.948 --> 02:41.202
Oh. Shit. You know what?
I actually almost forgot.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.496
Christ.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.418
I didn't bring it up before
because of the fire and all,

02:48.501 --> 02:51.880
but someone stole a generator
from Neumann's Hill.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.842
Damn. Well, hope they catch them bastards.

02:55.925 --> 02:59.554
There's security footage
of your Bronco there that night.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.680
[exhales]

03:00.763 --> 03:03.641
Wasn't us.
Must've been somebody else's Bronco.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.059
I sold it to you.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.104
The bumper's bent
from when I took you wheelchair skiing.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.233
We didn't steal a generator.

03:13.192 --> 03:14.819
I know it was one of you.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.362
Y'all are my best friends.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.741
I'll do what I can to cover for you,
but I'm not losing my job.

03:20.783 --> 03:24.746
-We didn't take it, Pong.
-[sighs] Nope. But we did take these.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.539
Shit.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.170
Damn! Thanks for coverin'.

03:34.380 --> 03:38.676
No, fuck you. I knew this was gonna
come back and haunt us.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.638
Hey, hey, you heard Billy,
dude, we're fine.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.140
The only reason you're not in jail now

03:44.224 --> 03:46.768
is 'cause Billy's a good friend
and a dishonest cop.

03:47.352 --> 03:51.356
That generator might be the difference
between our ranch burnin' down and not.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.359
I knew the risks. I made the choice.
It was the right one.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.778
What if somebody else saw the Bronco?

03:56.861 --> 03:58.905
They didn't. I'm a fuckin' ninja.

03:59.614 --> 04:03.618
If I'm goin' down because of you,
it better be for something awesome.

04:03.701 --> 04:07.288
Like kidnapping John Elway
and making him tell us stories.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.710
[theme song playing]

05:14.856 --> 05:15.857
[Colt] Damn.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.985
Yeah. We're pretty fortunate.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.904
Beau, this house is like you.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.615
It's old, it's creaky,
but it just won't die.

05:26.784 --> 05:30.288
Yeah, it probably yelled at the fire,
"Get off my property!"

05:31.664 --> 05:36.002
It's hard to believe it's still here after
the devastation we saw on the way over.

05:36.085 --> 05:39.505
-Yeah. Those firefighters saved our asses.
-Yep.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.174
They're amazing. So brave.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.302
We should find a way
to show our gratitude.

05:44.385 --> 05:47.305
I wonder if they have any burns
I can rub aloe on.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.142
I've been thinking about becoming
a reserve firefighter.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.185
No.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.606
You boys worked hard too.

05:57.148 --> 06:00.276
Hadn't been for that generator
running those Rain Birds,

06:00.359 --> 06:02.945
we might've had
a whole different scenario.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.326
Yeah. Hear that?
The generator saved our asses.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.788
And Daddy loves me more than you.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.708
Yeah. Well, I can't believe
you got her up and running.

06:16.459 --> 06:20.088
I wish I had a camera,
so I had some video of you fixin' it.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.632
Well, you wouldn't want cameras out here.

06:22.715 --> 06:26.469
There'd be a lot of footage of Abby
sneaking over to my cabin.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.306
I wanna get out and see how we fared.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.600
We're in better shape
than I thought we'd be.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.938
Probably get it up and running
just in time for me to die.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.650
-We should check on the Petersons.
-Good call.

06:40.733 --> 06:44.695
-I'm gonna head to the bar.
-We should all head over to the bar.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.573
What the fuck is wrong with you?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.326
Dad, look at you.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.371
Look at me.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.414
Look at this Muppet.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.474
[Abby sighs]

07:16.060 --> 07:16.894
Jesus.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.274
There's nothing left.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.026
I mean, I guess the fireplace, but...

07:26.112 --> 07:29.407
I don't think anybody's gonna
want a fire anytime soon.

07:34.328 --> 07:37.039
-I don't know where to start.
-[sighs]

07:37.832 --> 07:39.750
This was gonna be our home.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.880
Yeah. What about Peterson?

07:44.714 --> 07:46.716
We told him he could live here
till he died.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.678
He's halfway around the world.
All his stuff's...

07:52.638 --> 07:53.639
gone.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.976
We have insurance, right?

07:57.935 --> 07:59.479
-Yeah.
-Okay.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.315
The assholes at the bank
forced us to get it.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.486
I know this is a setback.

08:06.569 --> 08:10.907
But we've had a million of 'em,
and we always overcome 'em, okay?

08:10.990 --> 08:12.241
We are gonna be fine.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.452
Yeah.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.788
At least we can rebuild.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.250
A lot of people were wiped out.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.045
Exactly. I'm gonna be in Denver, teaching.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.088
So we just need you to

08:26.172 --> 08:30.176
build an entire home by the time
I get back here on maternity leave.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.596
You got three months.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.514
[chuckles]

08:38.893 --> 08:39.894
Damn.

08:40.603 --> 08:44.857
Well, I guess we can rebuild
exactly what we want, right?

08:45.441 --> 08:46.317
Which means--

08:46.400 --> 08:49.445
We are not building a living room
floor out of bouncy house material.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.030
No.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.785
I don't know how long it will take
to get the insurance money.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.579
We don't even know
how much damage there is.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.916
-What about the money my dad offered?
-I don't want his money.

09:01.999 --> 09:06.295
Why not? It could get the ranch back
on its feet and help us rebuild.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.674
Mama needs a Jacuzzi
with her five o'clock wine.

09:12.343 --> 09:16.681
Your dad and I are finally getting along.
Money's just gonna fuck that up.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.724
He wouldn't have offered
if he didn't want to.

09:18.808 --> 09:19.976
We're not taking his money.

09:20.059 --> 09:23.145
-You're being unreasonable.
-We don't need him.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.939
For example, the Jacuzzi.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.066
All we need is a horse trough
and an outboard motor.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.067
You're welcome.

09:45.042 --> 09:48.879
-How's everything look?
-Well, pretty good for the most part.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.341
The only spot that don't
is where you're standing.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.015
Peterson's house and pasture's torched.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.225
-[sighs] Christ.
-Fuck.

10:02.184 --> 10:05.104
Peterson gets cancer
and his house burns down.

10:05.646 --> 10:08.107
I think God hates him more than I do.

10:10.568 --> 10:14.572
At least his herd got away from the fire
when that wind shifted.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.074
Thanks to you for pulling that fence.

10:18.117 --> 10:21.412
-Which means I owe you an apology for--
-I accept.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.541
Sorry, you weren't done? Keep going.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.751
I'm done.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.882
Nicest thing you've ever said to me.
"I want to apologize for..."

10:37.053 --> 10:38.888
Is that a Neumann's Hill truck?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.974
What the hell are they doing here?

10:45.895 --> 10:49.190
Probably here for that generator.
You put it in the shed?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.193
No, but you're about to help me do it.

10:52.276 --> 10:55.863
Daddy, I was talking to Colt
about all the work he did today,

10:55.946 --> 10:58.532
and it's all wrong,
so I'm gonna go fix it.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.285
Makes sense.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.340
Can I help you?

11:14.423 --> 11:16.717
I hope so. Are you Beau Bennett?

11:16.801 --> 11:20.346
Probably should start with who you are
and why you're on my property.

11:20.429 --> 11:23.224
Yep, you're Beau Bennett.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.518
I'm Lisa Neumann.

11:25.601 --> 11:29.355
I know who you are.
You're the owner of Neumann's Hill.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.274
I've taken your name in vain quite a bit.

11:34.276 --> 11:35.486
How can I help you?

11:35.569 --> 11:38.155
[clicks tongue] Well, I need a favor.

11:39.490 --> 11:43.911
Three of my ranches got hit by the fire.
I've got nowhere to run the cattle.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.205
If they don't eat, they die.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.875
I wanna kill 'em,
but not until they're nice and fat.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.086
[groans]

11:53.337 --> 11:56.674
Neumann's Hill wants to graze
their cattle on my land?

11:56.757 --> 12:00.052
[scoffs] You look like I just asked you
to vote Democrat.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.014
I know you're not a fan of ours.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.100
I like you just fine,

12:06.183 --> 12:08.894
for someone who's
taken advantage of a lot of my friends.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.147
Have you talked to your friends?

12:11.230 --> 12:14.024
Of course not.
That's why they're still friends.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.488
Everyone I've done business with is happy.

12:19.572 --> 12:24.827
And yes, we're a big corporation, but we
make fair deals and everyone benefits.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.203
Especially you.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.124
I don't think your argument is with me.

12:30.207 --> 12:33.252
Your argument
is with the way the world works.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.087
I can't argue with that.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.258
We'll pay you a better-than-fair price.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.470
And we'll provide feed
and labor to take care of them.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.973
I just need a place to put 'em
until we can get them to market.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.267
How many cows are we talking about?

12:48.350 --> 12:49.935
As many as you can handle.

12:50.019 --> 12:56.192
[chuckles] Look, we had to cut fences,
I got my own cows to gather.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.820
We can help you with that.
Now your herd comes first.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.364
I'll tell you what.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.784
Stop by tomorrow
and I'll give you my answer.

13:05.868 --> 13:09.663
If you're holding a shotgun,
I'll assume it's a no.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.708
-I'll see you then.
-Bye.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.839
I know you think
you're dealing with the devil,

13:18.923 --> 13:22.259
but I grew up on my family ranch
just like you did.

13:23.093 --> 13:26.013
And I saw an opportunity
to buy the land next door

13:26.096 --> 13:29.350
and then the ranch next to that,
and it took off from there.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.603
We're a lot alike.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.605
The only difference is

13:34.688 --> 13:38.067
when I get mad at the Broncos,
I don't yell at the TV.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.277
I call the owner and yell at him.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.074
-Tell him to get a fucking quarterback.
-[Lisa laughs]

13:52.998 --> 13:54.542
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

13:55.584 --> 13:59.380
What did that Neumann's Hill lady want?

14:00.047 --> 14:02.174
They got hit hard by the fire.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.387
They wanna pay us
to put some of their cattle on our land.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.139
That's it? Well, fuck that.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.770
On to more important business,
like what are we drinking?

14:17.773 --> 14:19.567
I told her I'd think about it.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.860
-What?
-What?

14:21.485 --> 14:24.154
Why would you tell her that? Was she hot?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.951
The truth is we got room.

14:30.327 --> 14:34.164
I think we can help them out
before their grass comes back.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.084
Yeah.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.962
[chuckles] I like it.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.048
Whatever they're offerin',
tell 'em it's double.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.633
They can afford it. You saw her truck.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.469
She's got windshield wipers on both sides.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.014
No.

14:50.097 --> 14:53.559
Ain't no amount of money
worth bailing out Neumann's Hill.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.437
They're trying to take advantage
'cause we got a pasture and they don't.

14:57.479 --> 15:01.358
That's exactly why we should gouge 'em
for every penny we can get.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.652
It's our chance to fuck them.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.031
Their cows don't eat,
they don't get to market.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.950
And you didn't say
whether or not she was hot.

15:11.076 --> 15:14.747
We can't pass up this money.
It could help us get to market.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.834
We'll get to market. There's no reason
to throw Neumann's Hill a lifeline.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.296
All right, that's enough.
You both make good points.

15:22.838 --> 15:26.800
I'll consider your opinions
and I'll do whatever the fuck I want.

15:35.225 --> 15:39.313
Hey, Mom.
One of your boxes was in the Bronco.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.775
I put two boxes out there.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.778
Well, a lot of people
suffered losses in the fire.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.615
Let's focus on what we do have.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.909
Which is a box of shit that I don't drink.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.913
Finish this up. I'm gonna get some more.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.500
I have to do inventory,
so don't drink anything.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.085
[chuckles] Yeah, okay.

16:04.588 --> 16:08.342
Excuse me. Hey, is Maggie Bennett here?

16:08.425 --> 16:10.719
Mmm. Yeah, she's in the back.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.764
It's my turn to ask a question.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.810
I got a Van Halen and
a Waylon Jennings shirt.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.062
Which do you want to sleep in tonight?

16:24.483 --> 16:27.820
Well, it does look like you wear
a women's medium.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.281
Sizing me up already.

16:32.032 --> 16:35.619
Yeah, medium-sized shirt,
extra-large jeans.

16:38.205 --> 16:42.793
-Guessin' you could figure out why.
-Because Goodwill didn't have extra small?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.048
So the dance begins.

16:51.802 --> 16:54.722
What the fuck are you doing here?

16:55.264 --> 16:56.932
Hey, Maggie. [chuckles]

16:57.016 --> 17:00.019
That's a better greeting
than I got from this creep.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.689
This creep is your nephew.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.027
Wait.

17:08.944 --> 17:09.945
"Nephew"?

17:10.779 --> 17:13.115
Holy shit. Are you Aunt Karen?

17:13.198 --> 17:15.284
And that's Jameson? Oh, my God. [chuckles]

17:15.367 --> 17:18.162
I haven't seen you
since you were a little baby.

17:18.245 --> 17:20.539
Yeah. Grew up to be pretty hot, huh?

17:25.085 --> 17:26.879
Why am I still hitting on you?

17:28.589 --> 17:29.590
What do you want?

17:29.673 --> 17:34.011
You haven't returned any of my messages
and we need to talk.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.847
-It's important.
-Yeah, it's always important.

17:36.930 --> 17:40.684
And it usually ends with me giving you
a bottle of clean urine.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.895
This time is different.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.272
I only need to talk to you for a bit.

17:45.355 --> 17:48.317
Although, if you do
have a bottle of clean urine...

17:49.318 --> 17:51.528
Well, it's always good to have one.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.115
I got a guy.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.828
Whatever brought you here,
I can't help you.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.415
-Maggie, come on.
-No, I'm done. Sorry.

18:04.083 --> 18:08.337
I have cancer
and the doctors say it doesn't look good.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.338
[Maggie sighs]

18:11.131 --> 18:13.467
[cell phone chiming]

18:14.176 --> 18:16.178
Shit. Sorry, I get updates.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.348
Oh. Rockies just won on a walk off.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.142
You know what? Not important.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.773
Okay, so you got cancer.
It don't look good. Go ahead.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.360
[exhales] So, can we talk?

18:32.319 --> 18:35.739
I'm sorry for what you're going through,
but the answer's still no.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.786
All right. Well, if you change your mind,

18:40.869 --> 18:44.623
I'll be over at the Marriott
in Grand Junction for a few days.

18:44.706 --> 18:48.919
So you have my number.
Just don't give it to him.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.928
Jesus, Mom. That was harsh.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.681
She really that bad?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.809
When my dad was dying,

19:04.393 --> 19:07.688
she went to the bank,
cleaned out his account

19:07.771 --> 19:09.815
and ran off to Pensacola with a drummer.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.485
We couldn't even pay
for my dad's hospice care.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.031
So, is that it?
You're just gonna tell her to fuck off?

19:18.115 --> 19:21.451
I don't owe her anything.
And she's a shitty sister.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.371
Right. Well... [inhales]

19:25.289 --> 19:29.168
Thank God I don't got a shitty brother
who disappears whenever he wants,

19:29.251 --> 19:31.003
only comes back when he needs something.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.214
'Cause I would say,
"I don't owe him nothing."

19:34.756 --> 19:37.593
But my mom would say,
"You're being an asshole.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.847
He's your brother. Work it out."

19:41.930 --> 19:43.640
What the fuck do I know?

19:50.272 --> 19:53.650
<i>-Animal Farm.</i>
-[Abby] Mmm.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.360
What's that about?

19:55.944 --> 19:59.364
Well, it's an allegorical critique
of Stalinism using farm animals.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.284
All right.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.579
Well, there's a pig named Snowball.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.873
It's kinda like <i>Babe Goes to Russia.</i>

20:09.166 --> 20:10.417
[both chuckle]

20:10.500 --> 20:15.631
Yeah, I could just see him with one
of them big furry hats on, sipping vodka.

20:15.714 --> 20:16.965
[both chuckle]

20:17.591 --> 20:19.259
"That will do, pig."

20:22.137 --> 20:23.096
[Abby] Oh.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.640
-That's your pops.
-[Abby] Yeah.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.017
-[Chuck] Hey!
-[groans]

20:27.100 --> 20:29.019
Hey. What are you doing here?

20:29.102 --> 20:31.855
Did you take money from my wife
without telling me?

20:32.439 --> 20:35.817
Did I take money from your wife
without telling you?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.069
Did you?

20:37.152 --> 20:39.154
Holy shit, Colt. Did you?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.364
Did I?

20:41.198 --> 20:45.285
He did, Abby. Right after I told him
I wouldn't give him money.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.370
[stammering] Okay.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.040
She invested in the ranch
and told me to keep it a secret.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.460
I'll pay her back
as soon as the cattle go to market.

20:53.543 --> 20:56.004
Why did you try to get
more money out of me?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.924
Why did I try to get
more money out of you?

21:01.009 --> 21:03.637
For real. I don't know what's going on.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.391
Abby showed up this morning,
said you wanted a loan.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.936
-I told you I didn't want his money.
-Colt didn't know.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.062
I didn't know.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.064
Stop repeating everything.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.069
I was against this from the beginning,

21:19.152 --> 21:22.364
but I gave you another chance
because Abby asked me to.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.199
I am done giving you chances.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.410
[stammering] Wait. Come on. Dad.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.162
Don't defend him. He'll never change.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.623
But... Jesus.

21:37.796 --> 21:43.135
Why did you ask your dad for money
when I told you I didn't want it?

21:43.218 --> 21:46.388
'Cause I didn't know
you'd been lying for four months.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.765
I either lie to you or lie to your mom.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.726
Lie to my mom! I do it all the time.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.355
She thinks we didn't have sex
until we got married.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.274
You're five months pregnant.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.944
Yeah, I'm a good liar.

22:01.903 --> 22:04.364
[stammering] She told me
not to tell anyone.

22:04.448 --> 22:08.869
I'm not anyone, I'm your wife.
You don't lie to me, I don't lie to you.

22:08.952 --> 22:11.455
You lied to me about
asking your dad for money.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.833
That wasn't a lie.
That was me going behind your back.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.376
Okay, okay.

22:16.460 --> 22:21.006
I'm no Alfred E. Einstein or nothing,
but that seems like the same thing.

22:22.632 --> 22:25.052
We've been married for 24 hours
and we're already keeping secrets.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.179
-You think I like it?
-Then don't lie to me!

22:27.262 --> 22:28.138
Don't lie to me!

22:28.221 --> 22:29.222
-I won't!
-Okay!

22:29.306 --> 22:30.348
-Okay!
-All right!

22:30.432 --> 22:31.349
-All right!
-I'm sorry!

22:31.433 --> 22:34.102
-Me too! Why are we still yelling?
-I don't know!

22:37.773 --> 22:39.524
I wasn't trying to hurt anyone.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.693
I know.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.030
We just gotta be honest with each other.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.114
You're right.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.367
From now on, it's total honesty.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.957
-All right, now, with that in mind...
-Hmm.

22:58.710 --> 23:02.005
Did you hook up with Rooster
all them years I was gone?

23:05.175 --> 23:08.720
Did I hook up with Rooster
all them years you were gone?

23:10.597 --> 23:12.265
-Did you?
-Did I?

23:16.186 --> 23:18.688
All right. You're fucking with me, right?

23:18.772 --> 23:22.150
[chuckles] I'm fucking with you. Right?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.695
[laughs]

23:32.285 --> 23:33.286
Hey.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.706
Thanks for calling me.

23:38.416 --> 23:40.418
Wow. This is pretty sweet.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.631
If you get stopped for a DUI,
you could pull over and say you live here.

23:46.591 --> 23:51.096
Come on. Let's cut to the chase.
How much will it take to make you leave?

23:52.472 --> 23:53.765
I don't want money.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.642
Really?

23:55.725 --> 23:58.061
Because the last time you had "cancer,"

23:58.145 --> 24:01.148
the whole family
gave you every penny we had.

24:01.231 --> 24:04.818
Turns out the cure for breast cancer
is on a beach in Ibiza.

24:06.653 --> 24:10.949
[chuckles] To be fair, in Ibiza,
you get your breasts examined a lot.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.580
Yeah, fake cancer is very funny.

24:17.747 --> 24:21.209
[clicks tongue] Not as funny
as real cancer.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.880
Do you know how mad it makes me
that you actually might be sick

24:24.963 --> 24:27.841
and I can't feel bad
because I don't trust you?

24:27.924 --> 24:29.634
All I can say is I'm sorry

24:29.718 --> 24:32.804
and that I am not lying
about having cancer this time.

24:34.306 --> 24:39.895
Look, I know our relationship is fucked.
But don't you wanna fix it?

24:40.520 --> 24:44.566
Honestly, no. Until you showed up,
I hadn't thought about you at all.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.027
'Cause I have no regrets.

24:47.110 --> 24:50.447
If you have some,
that's your responsibility to fix it.

24:50.530 --> 24:53.533
All right.
Then I guess I'm asking for a favor.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.828
Don't you wanna do crazy stuff
like we used to?

24:56.912 --> 24:58.538
We'll <i>Thelma and Louise</i> it.

24:58.622 --> 25:03.293
We'll blow up some redneck trucker's rig
and I'll have sex with Brad Pitt.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.128
Of course you get Brad Pitt.

25:06.296 --> 25:09.174
What do you want me to say?
That I forgive you?

25:09.257 --> 25:12.886
Fine. I forgive you.
But that's all you're getting.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.555
Not every relationship should be fixed.

25:15.639 --> 25:19.392
I mean,
it's like Taylor Swift and anybody.

25:20.685 --> 25:21.728
Maggie...

25:24.731 --> 25:27.776
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life...

25:28.360 --> 25:29.611
but you're my sister.

25:30.153 --> 25:32.697
You are the only family that I have left.

25:32.781 --> 25:33.782
Come on, Karen.

25:33.865 --> 25:37.160
If our relationship mattered to you,
you'd have shown up long ago.

25:39.871 --> 25:43.541
All right, all right.
Well, um, thanks for hearing me out.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.169
I won't bother you again.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.300
Oh, Karen, wait.

25:55.595 --> 25:59.182
Mom's chicken soup.
She'd be pissed if I didn't feed you.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.309
Thank you.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.647
You're not getting a hug
if that's what you're waiting for.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.275
Actually, I was waiting for a spoon.

26:14.864 --> 26:17.200
Hey, what's all this?

26:17.784 --> 26:22.247
Salvaged some wood from Peterson's barn.
We can use it to rebuild the shed.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.164
Huh.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.000
Good idea.

26:26.042 --> 26:29.838
Well, what can I say?
I saw a problem and I solved it.

26:29.921 --> 26:33.425
Good. You got the wood
from Peterson's I asked you to get.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.513
He's old. I'll let him have it.

26:41.349 --> 26:44.894
Lookee there.
The Neumann's Hill lady's back.

26:45.687 --> 26:49.232
How you wanna play this, Daddy?
Good rancher, bad rancher?

26:49.316 --> 26:52.569
Yeah, you be bad rancher.
Think you can manage that?

27:04.831 --> 27:05.832
Hey, Beau.

27:05.915 --> 27:09.878
Hey. Lisa Neumann, my sons,
Colt and Rooster.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.796
Nice to meet you, Colt.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.008
Rooster, you used to run
one of my ranches for a bit.

27:15.550 --> 27:20.096
It's nice to finally put a face to the ass
that used to moon our security cameras.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.434
Well, I was told when I was hired,

27:24.517 --> 27:26.770
I could do whatever I want
during my lunch break.

27:27.354 --> 27:31.024
So, Beau, you had a chance
to consider my proposal?

27:31.107 --> 27:33.651
I have. We'll take your cattle.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.445
-What?
-Yeah.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.322
That is great news. Thank you.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.992
Why don't we work out the finances
over a glass of whiskey?

27:41.076 --> 27:43.995
I negotiate better
when the other person is drunk.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.873
That's how I got Rooster so cheap.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.126
There's no need to negotiate.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.962
All I need is enough
to cover our expenses.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.965
Uh... Dad?

27:57.467 --> 27:58.468
He's old.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.889
So, our expenses are gonna be, roughly...

28:03.723 --> 28:05.600
double whatever you think they are.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.979
Look, I'm not looking
to profit off this wildfire.

28:11.481 --> 28:14.109
Big corporate outfit or no,
you're a rancher.

28:14.692 --> 28:16.820
At the end of the day,
we take care of our own.

28:17.737 --> 28:18.571
Well...

28:19.531 --> 28:20.532
Well, thank you.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.868
I hope someday I can return the favor.

28:24.577 --> 28:25.620
Thank you.

28:26.996 --> 28:30.375
Any chance you can send me
that footage of me mooning you?

28:32.043 --> 28:34.921
Some of the dating apps
let you post video now.

28:36.005 --> 28:38.758
Hey, Beau, thanks again.
You're a good man.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.220
And your two sons are... [sighs]

28:43.179 --> 28:44.389
You're a good man.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.857
-All right. What's the real plan?
-You just heard it.

28:55.859 --> 28:59.195
Dad, I get you're trying to be honorable,
okay?

28:59.279 --> 29:01.448
But these are not honorable people.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.409
Neumann's Hill is out to screw you
any way they can.

29:05.076 --> 29:08.747
I know these kind of people.
Because I am these kind of people.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.959
-We need this money, Dad.
-Stop.

29:14.461 --> 29:17.297
Hard times aren't gonna change
the way we run this ranch.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.722
Dude, what the hell was that?

29:27.640 --> 29:28.683
I don't know.

29:31.227 --> 29:34.272
Instead of fucking Neumann's Hill,
we're fucking ourselves.

29:34.355 --> 29:37.484
No kidding. Neumann's Hill should
not be on our property.

29:37.567 --> 29:40.028
They're gonna be.
So we gotta get rid of this generator.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.405
She did not come here for that.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.699
-We are in the clear.
-"In the clear"?

29:44.783 --> 29:46.451
Billy said they got video of the Bronco.

29:47.035 --> 29:50.914
The only video she's got is of my ass.
It's clear she liked it.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.501
It served its purpose.
It got us through the fire.

29:54.584 --> 29:57.086
Kept the sprinklers going.
Now it's time to ditch it.

29:57.170 --> 30:00.590
Like you ditched that Red Lobster waitress
after all-you-can-eat-shrimp month.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.427
Dude, chill out. It's over. Okay?

30:04.511 --> 30:07.263
And I didn't ditch Sarah.
I'm not a monster.

30:08.097 --> 30:10.058
We broke up after her husband
came out of that coma.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.857
Want some company?

30:21.152 --> 30:24.280
Sorry, stupid question.
I'm coming in anyway.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.075
The boys fuck something up?

30:27.867 --> 30:30.912
Sorry, stupid question.
What did the boys fuck up?

30:33.790 --> 30:36.334
No, I've been with my sister.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.295
Rooster said she was in town.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.339
Did he say she has cancer?

30:41.422 --> 30:44.342
They didn't get all the fake cancer
the first time?

30:46.052 --> 30:47.929
She wants me to come with her to Florida.

30:48.012 --> 30:51.266
Every time I open myself up to her,
I get burned.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.767
You believe her this time?

30:53.685 --> 30:55.144
'Cause the last time this happened,

30:55.228 --> 30:58.356
we emptied out Rooster's college fund
to help her.

30:59.816 --> 31:03.027
Though I'm not sure why we had
that fund to begin with.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.238
Not a lot of Roosters at Stanford.

31:06.948 --> 31:11.369
Thing is, I kinda do believe her.
I mean, she didn't ask for anything.

31:12.328 --> 31:15.456
Of course, she didn't return
that fucking spoon either.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.877
If it's true, I hope she beats it.

31:19.752 --> 31:23.381
But your sister doesn't ask for things,
she just takes.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.218
Don't feel guilty for not going with her.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.095
Yeah.

31:29.762 --> 31:32.015
You're right, Beau. Thanks.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.146
You feel guilty, don't you?

31:39.355 --> 31:40.481
Not yet.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.233
But worst case scenario,

31:42.317 --> 31:44.861
if she's dead in six months
and I don't go on this trip,

31:44.944 --> 31:46.571
I'm gonna feel guilty then.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.408
[sighs] I think I'm gonna go.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.118
You're a good sister.

31:53.119 --> 31:55.830
It's like I was telling the boys
earlier today,

31:56.623 --> 31:59.918
"In times of need,
you gotta help out your own."

32:00.543 --> 32:03.212
Hey, Mom.
Dad, can you help me with this wood?

32:03.296 --> 32:06.799
I'm talking to your mother.
Do it the fuck yourself.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.200
[police siren wailing]

32:38.122 --> 32:39.332
Hey, Bennett.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.501
What are you doing?

32:44.879 --> 32:46.881
[country music playing]
