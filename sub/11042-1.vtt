WEBVTT

01:14.706 --> 01:16.230
We're cleaning
the house, baby.

01:17.108 --> 01:19.042
Pick him up.
I got him. I got him.

01:20.278 --> 01:21.336
Yeah!

01:21.413 --> 01:22.641
Nice shot.
He got lucky.

01:22.714 --> 01:24.648
Nice pass. Here we go. Ball.

01:25.016 --> 01:26.347
I got him.

01:26.885 --> 01:28.182
Don't let him shoot it!

01:29.454 --> 01:31.422
Come on, come on!
Put it up, Chuck!

01:31.489 --> 01:34.356
Oh, yeah. Chuck, my man.
All day, all day!

01:35.427 --> 01:36.587
Yeah, Tony!

01:36.661 --> 01:37.992
Tony, tag him.

01:38.530 --> 01:39.656
Good steal.

01:39.731 --> 01:40.959
Take the ball. Take the ball.

01:41.032 --> 01:42.032
Come on!

01:42.367 --> 01:43.493
Yeah!

01:44.269 --> 01:45.930
Come on, come on. Come on.

01:46.972 --> 01:48.269
Feel the power!

01:48.340 --> 01:49.398
Foul! Foul!

01:49.474 --> 01:50.566
That wasn't a foul.

01:50.642 --> 01:52.041
Chuck!
Shoot. That's it!

01:52.110 --> 01:53.805
Chuck!
Shoot it, man!

01:54.446 --> 01:57.176
Chuck! Chuck!
I need to talk to you!

01:57.682 --> 02:00.810
Hey, Darla, what's the matter with you?
You sound so upset.

02:00.885 --> 02:04.252
You slept with my twin sister on Saturday.
That's why I'm so upset!

02:04.322 --> 02:05.687
How do you know
for sure it wasn't you?

02:05.757 --> 02:07.554
'Cause I wasn't there.

02:07.626 --> 02:09.321
It sure looked like
you were there to me.

02:09.394 --> 02:10.725
Oh, he's dead.

02:10.794 --> 02:13.889
Come on, let's figure this out together.
This is a tricky situation.

02:13.965 --> 02:16.433
Do me a favor. Say, "Oh, Chuck,
keep buttering my biscuit."

02:16.501 --> 02:17.525
Get out of here.

02:17.602 --> 02:20.435
No, I'm trying to do detective work here,
so we can both be happy.

02:20.505 --> 02:22.996
I'm confused, too.
I feel violated!

02:23.341 --> 02:27.471
Chuck, keep buttering
my biscuit.

02:27.979 --> 02:29.879
You're right, that wasn't you.

02:29.948 --> 02:31.643
You are such a loser, Chuck!

02:31.716 --> 02:33.047
Let it go, Darla.

02:33.118 --> 02:34.380
Hey, look who's here.

02:34.452 --> 02:37.046
He has moved up
from Marshalls to Bloomingdale's.

02:37.122 --> 02:39.682
He didn't even know
it was you that night, Donna!

02:39.758 --> 02:41.158
That's a joke!
He thought it was me!

02:41.192 --> 02:42.284
He knew it wasn't you

02:42.360 --> 02:44.521
because you would never do
half the freaky stuff that we did!

02:44.596 --> 02:45.893
Don't tell me I don't know
how to satisfy a man!

02:45.964 --> 02:47.124
You show up here in your...

02:47.198 --> 02:48.563
You shut your mouth,
you fat-ass!

02:49.267 --> 02:50.894
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, girls, look, come on.

02:50.969 --> 02:53.028
Now, don't fight, you two.
You're sisters.

02:53.104 --> 02:54.465
Give each other a kiss
and make up.

02:54.506 --> 02:57.669
You're the only sisters you got.
Use your tongues.

02:57.742 --> 02:59.073
You dare us to?

02:59.144 --> 03:01.510
Unless that's too freaky
for Darla over here.

03:01.846 --> 03:06.408
You'd be surprised
just how freaky I can get.

03:06.718 --> 03:09.812
I'm sorry,
right now you gotta prove it to me.

03:09.888 --> 03:12.015
Come forward. That's right.

03:17.696 --> 03:18.924
Saved by the bell, girls.
Yeah.

03:20.098 --> 03:22.498
Hear the bell, gentlemen?
Let's go! Time to make a living!

03:22.567 --> 03:24.933
Somewhere something is burning!

03:30.575 --> 03:31.667
What we got?

03:31.743 --> 03:34.507
<i>Both companies, first due,
phone alarm. Prospect Place...</i>

03:34.579 --> 03:38.174
Larry, Larry, let's go.
All right, somebody call Larry a cab.

03:38.249 --> 03:39.546
Shut up.

03:39.651 --> 03:40.879
Fat-ass!

03:44.556 --> 03:47.719
Chuck, you said you were gonna
sign Mr. February for me!

03:47.792 --> 03:50.317
I will. I just gotta go
save the city first.

03:50.395 --> 03:51.516
I'll call you!
I'll call you!

03:51.529 --> 03:52.757
No, I'm gonna call him!

03:52.831 --> 03:54.264
No, I'm gonna call him!

03:58.837 --> 04:00.429
Hey, who's this guy?

04:00.505 --> 04:03.906
He's a transfer from Engine
Company 12. Name's Duncan.

04:03.975 --> 04:06.034
They say he put his captain
through a wall.

04:06.111 --> 04:07.339
For what?

04:07.412 --> 04:09.277
Don't know.
Don't want to know.

04:09.347 --> 04:11.611
And my advice,
don't ask him.

04:12.083 --> 04:13.380
Hey, you.

04:14.219 --> 04:18.120
My friend Karl here says
you're an ax murderer. Is that true?

04:18.555 --> 04:21.389
See, you're wrong, Karl.
This is Karl, by the way.

04:21.459 --> 04:25.225
He lives at 845 Rutland Road,
Apartment 4C. Right?

04:40.311 --> 04:41.869
Four floors fully involved.

04:41.946 --> 04:43.586
Be nice to have
some more ladders up here.

04:43.648 --> 04:44.672
Going in alive.

04:44.749 --> 04:46.740
Coming out the same way.
Let's go.

04:47.051 --> 04:48.643
Help me!

04:48.720 --> 04:51.484
Please! My son is up there!

04:51.556 --> 04:52.580
- My baby!
- All right.

04:52.657 --> 04:53.749
All right, all right,
we'll get your baby.

04:53.825 --> 04:54.814
Bernie!
We'll get your baby.

04:54.893 --> 04:56.690
- My baby Bernie! Please!
- Calm down, calm down.

04:56.761 --> 04:57.801
- Please!
- It's all right.

04:59.097 --> 05:01.177
Chuck, you got the keys. Use them.
You got it, Chief.

05:01.199 --> 05:02.530
All right.

05:04.369 --> 05:06.064
Thing's a pain in my ass.

05:08.239 --> 05:09.536
It's open.

05:09.607 --> 05:10.904
Show off.

05:13.545 --> 05:16.013
Bernie! Bernie!

05:16.080 --> 05:17.513
I'm up here!

05:17.582 --> 05:18.708
Hang in there, little man!

05:18.783 --> 05:20.250
Hurry!

05:20.318 --> 05:21.478
Up the stairs.

05:21.553 --> 05:22.577
Let me hear that voice!

05:22.654 --> 05:23.854
I'm up here in my room!

05:23.855 --> 05:25.482
All right, try and stay calm.
Come on.

05:32.096 --> 05:33.927
Where you at, buddy?
Hey!

05:33.998 --> 05:35.329
Let's hear that voice!

05:35.400 --> 05:37.129
I'm over here!

05:41.639 --> 05:44.164
All right, let's find a new way in.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.106
Help me.

05:51.249 --> 05:52.443
Yes!

05:52.684 --> 05:54.345
All right, all right.

05:54.419 --> 05:56.353
Oh, thank God!

05:56.421 --> 05:58.446
Holy Shamu.

05:58.523 --> 06:01.083
I'm sorry.
I can't get out of bed.

06:01.159 --> 06:02.683
There's a bed under there?

06:02.760 --> 06:04.455
Can you walk at all?

06:04.529 --> 06:06.360
I haven't walked
in five years!

06:06.431 --> 06:09.423
All right, maybe if we strap a rocket ship
on this guy, we'll get him out of here.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.333
No, no, we can do this. People lift cars.
It's adrenaline, you know?

06:12.403 --> 06:14.530
Well, cars.
This guy's more like a freaking minivan.

06:14.606 --> 06:16.574
Hey, buddy, we're gonna help you
out of here. Come on.

06:16.641 --> 06:17.972
- How's my mom?
- Your ma?

06:18.042 --> 06:20.875
If she survived the birthing process,
nothing's gonna take her down.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.435
So, what, just grab a side,
Chuck, come on.

06:22.513 --> 06:23.639
Get a side there.
What do you mean, get him?

06:23.715 --> 06:24.739
What are we gonna do here?
Come on, just...

06:24.816 --> 06:26.613
Come on. Come on!
We can't budge this fatso.

06:26.684 --> 06:28.675
I know, let me chop him up.
We'll take him down in pieces.

06:28.753 --> 06:29.753
What?
I'm kidding you.

06:29.821 --> 06:31.584
We gotta hurry up here. Let's go.
All right, all right.

06:31.656 --> 06:32.680
Just grab the back of our coats.

06:32.757 --> 06:34.520
Turn around, Chuck. Grab the back.
Okay. All right.

06:34.592 --> 06:37.220
Hey, hey, did you start this fire
by lighting one of your farts?

06:37.295 --> 06:38.319
That's funny.

06:38.396 --> 06:39.988
Hold on to our coats.
Hold on. Start running!

06:40.064 --> 06:41.088
Go!

06:47.338 --> 06:48.566
Go!

06:53.711 --> 06:55.474
I'm running, Mama!

06:55.546 --> 06:57.138
I'm running like the wind!

06:57.215 --> 06:59.240
Slow down! Slow down!

07:05.657 --> 07:06.885
Mama!

07:19.337 --> 07:21.862
Chuck! Chuck,
are you all right?

07:25.777 --> 07:26.903
Thank God.

07:35.653 --> 07:40.056
Oh, my God! Oh, sweet Lord.
Broccoli. Oh, my God!

07:42.393 --> 07:45.328
They saved me, those two.
Yeah, they're my heroes.

07:45.396 --> 07:46.829
I like you. I love you!

07:46.898 --> 07:49.594
Oh, get me a hero!
I'm starving!

07:49.667 --> 07:51.726
Oh, get me out of here!
Bring me to a deli!

07:51.803 --> 07:53.168
So, how are the kids doing?

07:53.237 --> 07:55.228
Oh, Tori, she's great, man.

07:55.306 --> 07:57.866
She's playing soccer,
scoring goals.

07:57.976 --> 07:59.568
- It's awesome.
- My man Eric?

07:59.811 --> 08:01.335
Is he starting
Little League yet?

08:01.412 --> 08:04.973
Yeah. I don't think
that's happening.

08:05.283 --> 08:06.443
Why not?

08:06.584 --> 08:11.521
<i>♪ May, me, my, mo, mo ♪
♪ Mo, me, my, mo, may. ♪</i>

08:11.589 --> 08:13.580
Okay, Eric? That's enough.

08:13.658 --> 08:15.148
Sit down
and get ready for dinner.

08:15.226 --> 08:16.420
Okay.

08:16.494 --> 08:19.895
Dad, you smell like smoke.
Did you put out a fire?

08:20.398 --> 08:22.161
I wasn't roasting
marshmallows.

08:22.233 --> 08:24.793
- That's so cool.
- You're so cool.

08:26.704 --> 08:27.904
Could you help me out, Teresa,

08:27.939 --> 08:29.839
and just grab that spaghetti sauce
out of the microwave?

08:29.907 --> 08:31.431
No. I have sub-train.

08:31.509 --> 08:32.601
Would you please?

08:32.677 --> 08:35.168
I just need a hand.
I don't really know what I'm doing here.

08:35.246 --> 08:37.806
Is last train for 15 minutes.

08:38.982 --> 08:41.780
All right, you can go.
Oh, God.

08:44.121 --> 08:45.453
Oh, God.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.597
There we are, Bolognese.

08:55.666 --> 08:57.896
Looks more like bowl of shit.

08:57.969 --> 09:00.437
Yeah, thanks for all
your help, Teresa.

09:00.505 --> 09:04.908
Okay, guys, so what is new?

09:04.976 --> 09:08.070
<i>I'm auditioning
for the school musical, Pippin.</i>

09:08.613 --> 09:13.243
You... You like that, huh?
The musical thing.

09:13.317 --> 09:16.047
Yeah, I love it.
I think it's my calling.

09:16.254 --> 09:18.119
That's what you said
about hopscotch.

09:18.189 --> 09:21.249
You're just jealous
'cause I can do the splits.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.023
Isn't that supposed
to hurt his testicles?

09:28.099 --> 09:29.191
Yes.

09:29.267 --> 09:30.307
You, don't talk like that.

09:30.334 --> 09:32.894
You, get back in your chair
and finish your hot dog salad.

09:33.137 --> 09:35.367
<i>...guy really
wants to take the ball every day,</i>

09:35.440 --> 09:37.101
<i>and going right back
out there.</i>

09:37.175 --> 09:38.870
<i>And hits one
to deep left field!</i>

09:38.943 --> 09:41.434
<i>Dunn back,
and it's out of here!</i>

09:41.512 --> 09:44.310
<i>And the Mets now have
a six to two lead.</i>

09:44.816 --> 09:45.816
Oh, boy.

09:47.985 --> 09:49.043
Brownies are ready.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.747
Would you stop using
my Easy-Bake Oven?

09:50.822 --> 09:52.483
But I like to bake.

09:52.557 --> 09:53.581
Guys, would you settle?

09:53.658 --> 09:55.378
Eric, why don't you watch
the Met game, huh?

09:55.393 --> 09:57.418
<i>Welcome to the Municipal
Employee and Planning Department.</i>

09:57.495 --> 09:58.655
<i>Please tell me your name.</i>

09:58.729 --> 10:01.027
Larry Valentine.

10:01.099 --> 10:03.567
<i>I'm sorry,
I didn't quite get that.</i>

10:03.634 --> 10:06.228
Larry Valentine.

10:06.838 --> 10:09.932
<i>You said, "Barry Schmalenpime."
Is that right?</i>

10:10.007 --> 10:11.565
Schmalenpime?

10:11.642 --> 10:13.667
<i>You said, "Schmalenpime."
Is that right?</i>

10:13.744 --> 10:15.769
I was enunciating.

10:15.847 --> 10:18.213
<i>You said, "I was enunciating."
Is that right?</i>

10:18.282 --> 10:19.306
Whoo!

10:19.383 --> 10:22.045
<i>You said, "Whoo!"
Is that right?</i>

10:22.120 --> 10:25.385
Dad, you have to try my brownies.
They're fabulous!

10:26.724 --> 10:29.659
Enough with the splits!
Watch baseball!

10:33.331 --> 10:37.199
Then it took 45 minutes
for this robot to stop calling me "Dairy."

10:37.268 --> 10:39.702
And then it starts asking me
if I'm calling from "Gooklyn."

10:39.770 --> 10:43.331
Look, all I'm trying to do is change
my beneficiary from my wife to my kids.

10:43.407 --> 10:46.774
Okay, you would have to file
a request to do that.

10:47.411 --> 10:49.140
Great. Let's do it.

10:49.747 --> 10:50.839
That's gonna take a while.

10:51.482 --> 10:53.202
Look, lady, I don't have a while,
all right?

10:53.217 --> 10:55.276
I'm a fireman.
I could die tomorrow.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.846
I guess if that happened,
you would be burned.

10:59.557 --> 11:00.757
Are you trying
to make a funny?

11:00.758 --> 11:02.692
Sort of.

11:03.528 --> 11:06.929
Anyhooser, beneficiaries can only be
changed for three events.

11:06.998 --> 11:08.625
Births, deaths and marriages.

11:08.699 --> 11:12.135
According to our records, we did
contact you when your wife passed away.

11:12.203 --> 11:15.263
You had a year.
You should have responded.

11:15.773 --> 11:18.674
Like a crazy person,
I was busy mourning the death of my wife.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.439
Off the record.

11:21.512 --> 11:23.639
I could suggest something
that's a little more simple

11:23.714 --> 11:26.774
and perhaps more fulfilling
to speed things up.

11:26.851 --> 11:29.012
That would be great.
What do... What do you got?

11:29.086 --> 11:30.485
Should you remarry,

11:30.555 --> 11:34.616
your new wife at that time
could be named your primary beneficiary.

11:34.692 --> 11:37.320
So if there's somebody special
in your life,

11:37.395 --> 11:41.024
I mean, who knows,
maybe even someone you just met,

11:41.098 --> 11:43.828
and you are ready
to make a commitment,

11:45.136 --> 11:46.296
maybe now's the time.

11:50.841 --> 11:52.365
Let's go crazy.

12:10.194 --> 12:12.025
Look how pretty she is.

12:12.096 --> 12:13.723
- Going in alive.
- Coming out the same way.

12:13.798 --> 12:14.856
All right, baby.

12:14.932 --> 12:16.024
Come on, bud.

12:20.104 --> 12:22.698
Levine, Valentine,
can we finish this secondary search

12:22.773 --> 12:24.741
so I can get home to my wife
and be denied sex?

12:24.809 --> 12:26.970
Yeah. Absolutely.

12:30.514 --> 12:32.505
So he's auditioning for a musical?

12:32.583 --> 12:34.175
<i>Yeah, Pippin.</i>

12:34.252 --> 12:36.720
<i>Pippen? That ain't so bad.
Is it about Scottie Pippen?</i>

12:36.787 --> 12:39.483
I don't know.
He practices singing a lot.

12:39.557 --> 12:41.149
Hey, Sinatra sang a lot.

12:41.225 --> 12:42.817
Yeah, that's true.

12:42.893 --> 12:43.917
Better than dancing.

12:43.995 --> 12:47.055
Yeah, it's just when I was his age,
all I did was sports, you know?

12:47.131 --> 12:50.294
Maybe they'll make skipping
an Olympic event. There's still hope.

12:50.368 --> 12:51.801
Come on, man,
I don't have enough problems?

12:51.869 --> 12:53.734
Baton swallowing.
I bet he'd be great at that.

12:53.804 --> 12:55.362
Yeah. You're an idiot.

12:55.439 --> 12:57.031
I'm just busting your balls.
Come on.

12:57.108 --> 13:00.134
Ladder 223, roof.
Secondary search negative.

13:00.211 --> 13:01.735
Going upstairs.

13:01.812 --> 13:04.042
At least the whole pension thing's
working out for you, buddy.

13:04.115 --> 13:06.174
Yeah. Hey, you know what?
Why don't you come back down here?

13:06.250 --> 13:08.582
I'll stick this pole up your ass,
turn you into a lollipop.

13:08.653 --> 13:10.314
You talking to me or your son?

13:10.388 --> 13:12.879
Get down here now!
I'll give you an ass-beating!

13:12.957 --> 13:14.686
I will destroy you!

13:18.596 --> 13:21.895
Hey, Larry, good news.
I found you something to eat.

13:22.466 --> 13:23.990
Cool, man.
I will devour that.

13:24.068 --> 13:25.092
You what?

13:25.169 --> 13:27.433
All right, I'll give you 1,000 bucks
you eat this thing's head.

13:27.505 --> 13:30.668
For 1,000 bucks, I'll start at the ass
and work my way to the head.

13:30.741 --> 13:31.935
This I gotta see, baby.

13:32.009 --> 13:33.101
Come on.

13:33.177 --> 13:34.508
Nothing but net.

13:34.578 --> 13:35.636
Here you go, buddy.

13:37.048 --> 13:38.276
Chuck!

13:39.050 --> 13:41.018
Larry!
Chuck!

13:41.085 --> 13:44.543
Mayday! Mayday!
Ladder 223, firefighter down.

13:44.622 --> 13:47.284
Holy shit!
I dropped the rat, dude.

13:47.358 --> 13:49.417
We'll have to do that
another time.

13:49.493 --> 13:52.223
That's all right, buddy.
Just relax. Stay calm.

13:53.964 --> 13:56.592
This thing's gonna break, man.
Get the hell out of here!

13:56.667 --> 14:00.535
No! Hey, man, we came in alive,
we're going out the same way. Come on!

14:00.604 --> 14:02.231
No! No!

14:02.673 --> 14:03.935
I got you!

14:06.277 --> 14:08.074
We got them over here!

14:09.180 --> 14:10.613
Chuck! Come on, man.

14:10.681 --> 14:12.046
Heads up!
Chuck.

14:15.252 --> 14:18.244
Urgent! Urgent!
Two members down!

14:23.794 --> 14:25.159
Mr. Levine?

14:26.831 --> 14:28.298
Mr. Levine?

14:29.633 --> 14:31.658
Do you know where you are?

14:32.136 --> 14:35.196
Am I in a Mötley Crüe video?
'Cause you're hot.

14:36.841 --> 14:38.399
Honey, how's my buddy doing?

14:38.776 --> 14:40.038
Honey?

14:42.480 --> 14:44.471
We're expecting
a full recovery.

14:44.548 --> 14:47.642
And, Mr. Levine,
please address me as "Doctor."

14:48.285 --> 14:50.810
Dr. Honey.
Yeah, okay, you got it.

14:52.890 --> 14:55.882
Chuck. What's going on, man?

14:56.660 --> 14:58.560
Brace yourself, Larry.

14:59.029 --> 15:01.759
What I'm gonna tell you
is pretty rough.

15:02.299 --> 15:05.928
They removed your entire body.

15:06.804 --> 15:09.034
You're nothing but a head now.

15:09.840 --> 15:10.840
What?

15:10.908 --> 15:14.537
They said that there was enough fat
in your head to rebuild you a new body,

15:14.612 --> 15:17.206
so they got scientists in the other room
working on it.

15:17.281 --> 15:18.976
God willing,
you're gonna be all right.

15:19.049 --> 15:20.641
You know, you're such a dick.

15:20.718 --> 15:23.710
What's going on is
you saved my life, man.

15:23.788 --> 15:25.949
I would've died
if you didn't do what you did.

15:26.023 --> 15:27.957
Would you stop being
so melodramatic?

15:28.025 --> 15:30.425
No. I owe you.
That's the code.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.428
Whatever you want,
whenever you want it.

15:32.496 --> 15:33.986
Whatever, whenever.

15:34.632 --> 15:36.327
- Whatever?
- Yes.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.424
I'll take that rat.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.628
You want to find that rat for me?
'Cause I'm hungry as hell.

15:39.703 --> 15:41.534
Hi, Dad.
Eric.

15:41.605 --> 15:43.596
Tori. Hey, guys, come on in.

15:43.674 --> 15:44.902
They called me out of class,

15:44.975 --> 15:48.809
and nobody would tell me for, like,
a really long time what was wrong.

15:48.879 --> 15:50.039
Did you die?

15:50.114 --> 15:51.741
Oh, no, Daddy's fine, buddy.

15:51.816 --> 15:53.417
I could go home right now
if I wanted to.

15:53.451 --> 15:57.751
I'm only staying here because your
Uncle Chuck, he's afraid to sleep alone.

15:57.822 --> 16:00.950
It's true, Eric. If he don't sleep with me,
then I gotta sleep with Dr. Honey.

16:01.025 --> 16:04.517
And you never know with Dr. Honey
what kind of mood she's gonna be in.

16:04.595 --> 16:06.028
What are you, six years old?

16:06.096 --> 16:08.826
Hey, where you going? Come here.
Lay down next to me.

16:08.899 --> 16:11.333
I'll split a Vicodin with you.
We'll have some fun.

16:11.402 --> 16:13.131
Come on.
You little tease.

16:13.204 --> 16:15.138
Dr. Honey.
Dr. Honey.

16:15.206 --> 16:18.073
Sweetie, what's the matter?
Come here. It's okay.

16:18.142 --> 16:21.578
This is the same hospital.
You know. Mom.

16:27.952 --> 16:30.420
I'm not gonna leave you.
You hear me?

16:31.188 --> 16:32.450
I'm never gonna leave you.

16:36.794 --> 16:37.915
I'm quitting the department.

16:37.962 --> 16:39.429
Get out of here, man.

16:39.497 --> 16:42.955
No, Renaldo's cousin's got
an Acura dealership down in Trenton.

16:43.033 --> 16:45.160
You want to sell cars?
Acuras?

16:45.236 --> 16:46.430
I don't want to.

16:46.504 --> 16:49.234
Every time I run into a fire,
where's my head gonna be?

16:49.306 --> 16:52.207
I'm all my kids got left.
If I die...

16:53.978 --> 16:55.639
Just don't wanna
leave them with nothing.

16:55.713 --> 16:58.079
Your father was a fireman.
His father was a fireman.

16:58.148 --> 17:00.173
You are a fireman, man.

17:00.251 --> 17:04.311
One of the best Brooklyn's ever seen.
That's it. You can't do nothing else.

17:04.387 --> 17:06.049
I don't think I have
any other choice.

17:06.123 --> 17:07.988
We'll come up with something,
all right?

17:08.157 --> 17:09.454
Come on, I promise you.

17:09.527 --> 17:10.824
Oh, poor Charlie.

17:10.895 --> 17:12.226
Hey, there are my girls.

17:12.296 --> 17:14.230
- How are you? How you doing?
- Oh, my leg hurts.

17:14.298 --> 17:15.356
How are you feeling?

17:15.432 --> 17:16.558
My leg.

17:16.634 --> 17:18.192
Oh, God.
We got different lives.

17:18.269 --> 17:20.829
I need some help out of here.
All right, Chuck's doing all right.

17:20.871 --> 17:21.871
Let's get in here.

17:21.939 --> 17:23.667
Hey, who wants to massage
my ass muscles?

17:23.741 --> 17:24.862
- Me!
- Me!

17:53.671 --> 17:54.831
Larry.

17:55.072 --> 17:57.040
- What time is it?
- 4:00.

17:57.107 --> 17:59.632
I saved your life, and you said
you owed me. You remember that?

17:59.710 --> 18:00.710
Yeah, you saved my life.

18:00.778 --> 18:02.439
Then you got me out of bed
at 4:00 in the morning.

18:02.513 --> 18:03.571
We're even. That's great.
Look.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.137
Hey, look, I'm just gonna
throw something out here,

18:05.215 --> 18:06.776
and it's gonna sound
a little bit crazy.

18:06.817 --> 18:08.658
- You're getting a breast reduction.
- No, shut up.

18:08.719 --> 18:10.653
No, look, I figured out
how to solve this pension problem,

18:10.721 --> 18:12.282
and I don't have to
quit the Department.

18:12.356 --> 18:13.380
Great. How?

18:13.457 --> 18:14.685
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna set things up

18:14.758 --> 18:16.749
so that you inherit
my benefits if I die.

18:16.827 --> 18:19.091
That way you'll be the one
responsible for Eric and Tori.

18:19.163 --> 18:21.495
Absolutely. That's a great idea.
How do we do that?

18:21.565 --> 18:24.500
Yeah. Domestic partnership.

18:25.703 --> 18:27.398
Domestic partnership.

18:27.871 --> 18:29.600
- You mean like faggots?
- No.

18:29.673 --> 18:31.402
I mean, yeah,
but, no, not us, obviously.

18:31.475 --> 18:34.638
No, no, not, you know...
It's just on paper, really.

18:34.712 --> 18:36.043
Paper faggots?

18:36.113 --> 18:39.514
Okay, look, the accepted
vernacular is "gay," but, yeah.

18:39.583 --> 18:41.517
I'm gonna get
something to drink.

18:41.585 --> 18:42.677
All right.

18:48.592 --> 18:49.592
Right.

18:55.399 --> 18:56.457
I'm gonna have to pass.

18:56.533 --> 18:57.557
You can't!

18:57.635 --> 19:00.433
Why don't you pay some chick to marry you
if you need this set-up?

19:00.504 --> 19:02.597
- Some chick? Like who?
- Give me the phone.

19:02.673 --> 19:04.514
I know plenty of chicks
who could use the cash.

19:04.575 --> 19:06.099
What do you want? A blonde?
A Puerto Rican?

19:06.176 --> 19:08.610
I'll get you a heavy girl.
She'll make you feel better about yourself.

19:08.679 --> 19:11.307
Hey, it doesn't matter.
I don't have any extra cash.

19:11.382 --> 19:13.577
Look, man,
you're the only person I can trust.

19:13.651 --> 19:16.051
Hey, you know who you could trust?
Your maid, Teresa.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.451
She steals!

19:17.521 --> 19:19.421
She steals?
Why don't you fire her?

19:19.490 --> 19:21.617
I'm afraid. I think she's into voodoo.
I don't know.

19:21.692 --> 19:23.319
- Oh, God.
- Look, this is the only way

19:23.394 --> 19:26.454
I can keep doing what I do
and make sure my kids are protected.

19:26.530 --> 19:29.328
Larry, look at us.
We're not gay.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.761
But if we were gay,
don't you think

19:30.768 --> 19:32.929
I'd be with someone
a little hotter-looking than you?

19:33.003 --> 19:35.130
I'm Mr. February,
for God's sake.

19:35.205 --> 19:39.335
It would be like the prom king
fooling around with a tuba player.

19:39.410 --> 19:40.707
Oh, great, I play tuba.

19:40.778 --> 19:42.336
Larry, I love you,

19:42.413 --> 19:44.938
but I'm not in love with you,
if that makes any sense.

19:45.015 --> 19:46.710
I still wanna be friends.

19:46.784 --> 19:49.309
All right, do me a favor.
Just picture this, please. All right?

19:49.386 --> 19:51.013
You're at my funeral

19:51.088 --> 19:53.283
and you're looking for my kids,
but they're not there.

19:53.357 --> 19:55.154
'Cause they're in some factory
in Bangladesh

19:55.225 --> 19:57.853
making sneakers
for six cents an hour.

19:58.462 --> 20:02.228
And you go home to nail some chick
you met at my gravesite.

20:02.299 --> 20:05.462
And you look up,
and right there in your window

20:06.003 --> 20:07.527
are my kids.

20:07.604 --> 20:09.970
They're just tapping
on the glass.

20:10.040 --> 20:13.532
And they have tears
just streaming down their faces.

20:13.610 --> 20:18.240
You think of that
and now you give me your answer.

20:20.050 --> 20:22.382
How are they tapping on my window
if they're in Bangladesh?

20:22.453 --> 20:25.217
Oh, my God. You're...
You're not following me here.

20:25.289 --> 20:27.086
- Yeah, I'm serious.
- Chuck?

20:27.157 --> 20:29.421
Thirsty. Do you have
anything to drink?

20:29.493 --> 20:32.087
Yeah, there's Gatorade
in the fridge.

20:32.362 --> 20:35.854
The girls are here.
The girls, they want the Gatorade.

20:35.933 --> 20:37.560
Oh, they're thirsty.

20:37.634 --> 20:38.999
Larry, Larry, watch this.

20:39.069 --> 20:42.232
Hey, girls,
actually it's down low, the Gatorade.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.365
I can't be gay, Larry.

20:45.442 --> 20:48.070
I could be a lesbian for you,
but that's about it.

20:48.145 --> 20:52.343
I am so lonely in here.
Hurry up, Chuck.

20:52.416 --> 20:54.680
Dr. Honey! Dr. Honey.
You know Dr. Honey.

20:55.085 --> 20:56.450
Yeah, I do.

20:57.054 --> 20:59.249
How are you feeling,
Mr. Valentine?

20:59.323 --> 21:01.018
It's still stiff
when I go to the right.

21:01.091 --> 21:02.115
That's normal.

21:02.192 --> 21:03.989
Hey, who untied you?

21:05.429 --> 21:07.693
What? What?
We have rules around here, girls.

21:08.866 --> 21:10.857
Specific orders, girls.

21:10.934 --> 21:13.664
Now I'm gonna go
Charlie Chaplin on your ass!

21:13.737 --> 21:16.399
Here, use the cane.
Use it! Use it!

21:16.473 --> 21:18.168
Whap them, whap them!

21:18.408 --> 21:20.205
You... You're just
an animal, man.

21:20.277 --> 21:22.541
I'm not an animal.
I am a whore.

21:22.946 --> 21:25.972
You don't want to marry the town whore.
Believe me, you're better than that.

21:26.049 --> 21:30.145
What I'm talking about is no more involved
than co-signing a loan or joining a gym.

21:30.220 --> 21:31.847
How do we know no one's
gonna find out about this?

21:31.922 --> 21:34.550
Because privacy laws
are super strict nowadays.

21:34.625 --> 21:37.617
Look, all we gotta do is just forward
your mail to my house for a while.

21:37.694 --> 21:38.820
That's it.

21:38.896 --> 21:40.659
Oh, I don't know.

21:40.731 --> 21:42.790
I saved your life, bitch.

21:45.169 --> 21:46.431
Partners?

21:47.538 --> 21:48.766
Partners.

21:48.839 --> 21:49.839
Shake on it?

21:50.741 --> 21:53.175
You should've
let me die, asshole.

22:10.894 --> 22:13.124
You're partners now, fellas.

22:20.737 --> 22:22.398
Teresa brought in the mail.

22:22.539 --> 22:24.564
That's a first. Me.

22:24.942 --> 22:27.240
Chuck. That's me.

22:29.713 --> 22:30.873
Chuck.

22:32.549 --> 22:33.573
Chuck.

22:34.718 --> 22:35.912
Chuck.

22:36.253 --> 22:37.777
What the hell?

22:38.422 --> 22:39.821
Chuck.

22:40.490 --> 22:41.490
Chuck.

22:42.426 --> 22:45.918
You gotta be kidding me.
They send these things blown up now?

22:45.996 --> 22:47.930
Is that doll for me?

22:48.699 --> 22:50.326
No, no, no, sweetheart.
No, it's for me.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.028
It's a... It's a training doll.
You know, for CPR.

22:53.103 --> 22:55.901
They're testing us again,
you know, to make sure.

22:55.973 --> 22:57.099
You remember Daddy
did the testing?

22:57.174 --> 22:59.608
You make sure the passageway
is clear, and you...

23:00.110 --> 23:01.600
To see if they're breathing.

23:01.678 --> 23:03.578
Sweetheart, go to your room, please.
Go to your room, okay?

23:03.647 --> 23:06.844
It's for me. She's fine.
She's fine. We're dancing.

23:07.117 --> 23:08.117
Whoa.

23:11.021 --> 23:13.683
Fire under control.
All units ten-eight, ten-eight.

23:14.224 --> 23:15.555
Great to have you back, Larry.

23:15.626 --> 23:17.389
Great to be back, Captain.

23:17.461 --> 23:22.524
Captain! Found out what started the fire,
an old-fashioned doobie.

23:22.599 --> 23:25.864
Hey, brother, that's my weed.
Can I get that back?

23:25.936 --> 23:27.426
You want this back?

23:27.504 --> 23:31.065
I can't give you it back. But you know
what? I got something better for you.

23:35.279 --> 23:36.712
Whoa, man!

23:38.315 --> 23:39.315
Do that again.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.444
He likes it.

23:42.886 --> 23:44.478
All right, enjoy it.

23:44.554 --> 23:46.784
Hey, man. Looks like
a powdered donut.

23:57.501 --> 23:58.501
Mr. Valentine?

23:58.568 --> 23:59.694
Yeah.

23:59.770 --> 24:03.137
Hi. I'm Glen Aldrich
from the Pension Department.

24:03.206 --> 24:06.232
I'd like to talk to you about
your recently filed domestic partnership.

24:12.115 --> 24:13.207
Hey.

24:13.550 --> 24:15.279
- Are you okay?
- No, yeah, no, I'm fine.

24:15.352 --> 24:19.482
That's how I always get down,
'cause it's just faster. You know. Steps.

24:19.556 --> 24:22.457
Is your partner home?
A Mr. Charles Levine?

24:22.526 --> 24:23.925
No, he...

24:24.528 --> 24:27.156
How did you...
How did you find out that that we were...

24:27.230 --> 24:28.424
It's standard procedure.

24:28.498 --> 24:31.194
You see, when a previously
registered portfolio shifts over

24:31.268 --> 24:33.964
to a domestic partnership filing
in the insurance log,

24:34.037 --> 24:36.877
there's an information sharing system
that notifies us of the adjustment

24:36.940 --> 24:38.271
to make sure
it's not a mistake.

24:38.342 --> 24:40.810
Why do you ask?
Were you keeping your partnership secret?

24:40.877 --> 24:42.674
Secret? What, are you kidding me?
Hell, no.

24:42.746 --> 24:44.407
No, we're telling everybody.
It's a party.

24:44.481 --> 24:45.812
Telling everybody what?

24:45.882 --> 24:47.577
Hey, butt out, Ron.

24:47.651 --> 24:48.948
Come over here.

24:51.054 --> 24:54.080
I hope you don't think we have any reason
to doubt your situation, Mr. Valentine,

24:54.157 --> 24:57.024
but the sad truth is some people
have used homosexual lifestyles

24:57.094 --> 24:59.426
as a cover to reap
illegal benefits.

24:59.496 --> 25:00.496
Wow.

25:01.965 --> 25:03.057
Who's that?

25:03.166 --> 25:05.134
That's Paula.
She's my late wife.

25:06.136 --> 25:07.831
So you haven't
always been gay.

25:07.904 --> 25:11.772
No. I'm newly gay.

25:12.509 --> 25:15.706
When... When she died,
I knew I'd never find another woman

25:15.779 --> 25:17.770
who'd make me as happy,

25:18.882 --> 25:21.146
and that's when I boarded
the dude train.

25:22.285 --> 25:23.377
Will you excuse me one second?

25:23.453 --> 25:24.511
Sure.

25:25.689 --> 25:28.317
Hey, homo, you see the moon balloons
on that chick?

25:28.392 --> 25:30.690
They're a jiggle away
from falling out.

25:30.761 --> 25:33.491
Oh, Chuck, don't tell me
you lost your key again, sweetheart.

25:33.563 --> 25:34.621
What key?

25:34.698 --> 25:38.964
Baby! How about a free show?
Why don't you shake them for me?

25:39.036 --> 25:42.267
Oh, you mean Ron, the mailman.
Yeah, Ron, you look great, man!

25:42.339 --> 25:44.569
Love the moon balloons.
Shake them! Shake them!

25:44.641 --> 25:46.905
Hey, Chuck,
come on in here a minute.

25:47.677 --> 25:51.670
This is Glen Aldrich from the Penis...
The Pension Department.

25:51.748 --> 25:53.648
Our Pension Department.

25:54.751 --> 25:55.751
Hi.

25:56.286 --> 25:58.584
- Oh, hey.
- Yeah.

25:58.655 --> 26:02.386
He... He knows about our partnership,
and he's just here checking up on us,

26:02.459 --> 26:06.520
making sure we're not running
a scam to collect illegal benefits.

26:06.997 --> 26:10.091
People do that?
What is with the world?

26:10.167 --> 26:11.293
Yeah.

26:11.368 --> 26:12.801
It just makes me so sad

26:12.869 --> 26:15.838
and gay to think
of that kind of...

26:15.906 --> 26:17.203
Yeah.
...behavior.

26:17.274 --> 26:18.400
Yeah.

26:18.475 --> 26:22.468
I just want to go to my room right now
and listen to Boy George records.

26:22.546 --> 26:23.604
Calm down.

26:23.680 --> 26:27.343
So you've moved your relationship
to the next level. How's it been going?

26:27.417 --> 26:32.787
Oh, great. We've just been having sex
with each other all the time.

26:32.889 --> 26:34.288
Loads of sex.

26:34.357 --> 26:35.585
Gay crazy sex.

26:35.659 --> 26:38.059
Man on man.
Loving every minute of it.

26:38.128 --> 26:41.097
Yeah, balls and wieners all the way.
Right here.

26:41.164 --> 26:42.188
Oh, yeah.

26:42.265 --> 26:44.563
Well, I won't take up
any more of your time.

26:44.634 --> 26:45.828
Bring the funk.

26:47.204 --> 26:48.796
Okay, thank you.

26:49.005 --> 26:50.097
So that's it?

26:50.173 --> 26:53.108
You don't... You don't have
any other questions for us or...

26:53.176 --> 26:56.009
Oh, no. No, that's not really
how we do it.

26:56.079 --> 26:59.310
You see, if my report says I thought
something was out of the ordinary,

26:59.382 --> 27:01.714
then the department assigns
a special investigator,

27:01.785 --> 27:03.685
and he or she'll just drop in
from time to time

27:03.753 --> 27:05.914
unannounced over the next three
or four months.

27:06.156 --> 27:07.156
No big deal.

27:07.724 --> 27:10.249
Let me... Just asking
was there anything that you saw

27:10.327 --> 27:12.591
that was out of the ordinary or...

27:13.163 --> 27:15.461
Oh, I can't tell you that.
All right, have a great day.

27:15.532 --> 27:16.931
Oh, we will.

27:19.903 --> 27:21.336
Nice seeing you.
Take care.

27:21.404 --> 27:22.530
Nice seeing you.

27:22.606 --> 27:23.971
We love your pants,
by the way. Very nice.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.803
We do.
Are those wrinkle-free?

27:25.876 --> 27:27.002
I think they are.
They look great!

27:27.077 --> 27:28.339
Snazzy!

27:28.411 --> 27:30.402
Yeah, no one's gonna
find out about us, I thought.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.812
Well... Yes!

27:32.883 --> 27:34.510
He likes it rough.
Yeah.

27:34.584 --> 27:35.642
- Bye-bye.
- Take care.

27:35.719 --> 27:36.743
Bye-bye now. Take care. Okay.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.082
You made a promise to me.

27:38.155 --> 27:39.179
All right, we're gonna
have sex now.

27:39.256 --> 27:40.382
Okay. We are.

27:40.457 --> 27:41.457
Sex now.
Here we go!

27:41.525 --> 27:42.525
Whoo!

27:45.128 --> 27:47.096
Why are we even seeing
this lawyer guy?

27:47.164 --> 27:49.325
I just want to find out
how much trouble we're in here.

27:49.399 --> 27:51.264
Maybe it's, you know,
no big deal.

27:51.334 --> 27:52.926
This guy'll be able
to tell us.

27:53.470 --> 27:55.961
Here, just give me your hand.

27:56.039 --> 27:57.939
Maybe we should
just be snuggling a little bit.

27:58.008 --> 27:59.100
You mean to look...

27:59.176 --> 28:00.541
Yeah, just a little bit like, you know.

28:00.610 --> 28:01.668
Yeah, that's good.

28:01.745 --> 28:03.645
Does this work, too?
Get away from me.

28:40.784 --> 28:43.810
Alex McDonough.

28:44.020 --> 28:46.454
Nice to meet you.

28:51.628 --> 28:52.788
Nice to meet you.

28:52.862 --> 28:54.523
Yeah, meet to nice you.

28:55.131 --> 28:56.496
What was that, Japanese?

28:56.566 --> 28:58.124
What? What are you
talking about?

28:58.201 --> 28:59.498
Meet to nice you.

28:59.569 --> 29:01.298
No, no, no, I didn't do that.

29:01.371 --> 29:02.929
You did. He did say it.

29:03.006 --> 29:04.234
You did.

29:04.307 --> 29:05.365
Okay.

29:05.442 --> 29:06.739
Okay, just come on in.

29:06.810 --> 29:08.607
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

29:10.714 --> 29:13.877
So my assistant says
that your domestic partnership

29:13.950 --> 29:15.611
is being challenged
by the city.

29:15.685 --> 29:19.553
Well, not exactly challenged yet,
but they're definitely sniffing around.

29:19.623 --> 29:21.420
- Home visit?
- Yeah.

29:21.491 --> 29:22.719
You're being targeted.

29:22.792 --> 29:24.020
Targeted?

29:24.094 --> 29:26.654
It's like an audit.
Who did they send?

29:26.730 --> 29:29.198
It was a Glen somebody.

29:29.266 --> 29:30.824
Probably the initial interviewer.

29:30.900 --> 29:34.358
But if you get a follow-up from
a funny little guy named Clint Fitzer,

29:34.437 --> 29:36.234
then we've got real trouble.

29:36.306 --> 29:39.400
Yeah, the city's really been cracking down
ever since the Bensley case.

29:39.476 --> 29:40.534
What's that?

29:40.610 --> 29:46.207
Well, in Colorado, a heterosexual
government employee married his gay friend

29:46.283 --> 29:49.980
so the friend could be covered
under Bensley's health insurance.

29:50.053 --> 29:51.350
The state found out about it,

29:51.421 --> 29:54.254
fired Bensley and prosecuted them both
for fraud.

29:54.324 --> 29:56.121
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

29:56.192 --> 29:58.922
I mean, these people needed
to be made an example of.

29:58.995 --> 30:02.294
I mean, gays and lesbians have not
been fighting for these rights for 40 years

30:02.365 --> 30:03.923
to be made a mockery of.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.228
But you guys have
nothing to worry about

30:05.302 --> 30:07.770
because you're
a legitimate gay couple, right?

30:07.837 --> 30:10.829
Oh, yeah, we're...
No, we're big-time fruits.

30:12.175 --> 30:15.406
I used to wrestle in high school,
and I loved it.

30:16.012 --> 30:17.172
Okay.

30:18.114 --> 30:20.207
Curiosity kicking up again.

30:21.017 --> 30:24.077
What exactly did they get,
the hetero bastards?

30:25.188 --> 30:28.851
Well, Bensley got five years
and his gay friend got three.

30:29.626 --> 30:32.459
And a coworker of Bensley's
got 18 months.

30:32.996 --> 30:34.327
Why? What did he do?

30:34.397 --> 30:37.764
Well, Bensley told him what was going on and
he never reported it to the authorities,

30:37.834 --> 30:42.567
so he was convicted of obstructing justice
and conspiracy to commit fraud.

30:43.606 --> 30:45.267
Pretty rough, huh?

30:45.608 --> 30:50.204
When I used to climb the rope in gym class,
I wished it was a guy.

30:52.916 --> 30:54.884
Well, there is a secret weapon

30:54.951 --> 30:57.511
that really might help get these guys
off your back.

30:57.587 --> 30:59.227
Oh, good. Oh, great.
Well, we love secrets.

30:59.255 --> 31:00.655
Yeah, we do them
all the time. Yeah.

31:01.758 --> 31:03.953
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I won't tell anyone.

31:04.027 --> 31:05.027
Nobody tells.

31:05.095 --> 31:07.825
That was a key he was throwing away,
that's what that was.

31:07.897 --> 31:09.228
Leave a trail.

31:09.299 --> 31:10.630
You know,
the strongest evidence

31:10.700 --> 31:13.134
for genuinely demonstrating
a domestic partnership

31:13.203 --> 31:15.865
is to take a quick drive
on up to Canada

31:15.939 --> 31:17.702
and legitimize
your relationship.

31:17.974 --> 31:19.100
Legitimize?

31:19.175 --> 31:20.403
Get married.

31:21.077 --> 31:22.476
Marry Larry?

31:33.957 --> 31:35.390
All right,
where do two guys get married?

31:35.458 --> 31:37.824
What do we got here?
Wedding Balls.

31:38.595 --> 31:40.790
I Do, I Do Love Clay Aiken.

31:40.864 --> 31:42.354
Great Rear Endings.

31:43.566 --> 31:45.261
Till Dicks Do Us Part.

31:45.635 --> 31:48.160
Where are we gonna do this,
sweetheart?

31:48.238 --> 31:49.705
What's the matter?
You getting cold nuts?

31:49.773 --> 31:53.573
No, no. It's just Paula always
wanted to go to Niagara Falls,

31:54.244 --> 31:56.269
and I never got the chance to take her,
you know?

31:56.346 --> 31:59.338
You were great to her.
It's been three years already, man.

31:59.416 --> 32:01.884
Just, just...
She would want you to be happy.

32:01.951 --> 32:03.711
She would want you to move on
with your life,

32:03.720 --> 32:05.688
find somebody new,
I'm telling you.

32:05.755 --> 32:08.349
You know what?
I did find somebody new.

32:08.525 --> 32:09.787
And I'm marrying him today.

32:09.859 --> 32:12.123
Oh, yeah. What a lucky girl.

32:12.796 --> 32:14.093
Queers.

32:14.164 --> 32:15.859
What was that?
What was that?

32:15.932 --> 32:18.196
I said tears.

32:18.268 --> 32:20.327
Your love for each other
brings tears to my eyes.

32:20.403 --> 32:21.768
That's what I thought you said, buddy.
Yeah. Yeah.

32:21.838 --> 32:23.135
Better watch what you say,
my friend.

32:23.206 --> 32:24.173
Why don't you
just drive the car?

32:24.240 --> 32:25.901
Doug Henning.
What the hell you think you're doing?

32:25.975 --> 32:27.408
You want a Brooklyn beating, moron?
Magic shoes. Yeah?

32:27.477 --> 32:29.138
- You want to get him nuts?
- Yeah? Smacked around?

32:29.212 --> 32:31.806
- Then shut your mouth.
- Don't, please.

32:33.983 --> 32:35.007
Faggots.

32:35.084 --> 32:37.075
All right, that's it, my man.
What's that, you son of a bitch?

32:37.153 --> 32:38.279
Grab the wheel. Grab the wheel.
Hold him down!

32:38.354 --> 32:39.354
Hey, I'm sorry!

32:39.422 --> 32:40.650
Hold him down, and I will...

32:40.723 --> 32:42.843
Come and drive now, moron!
Hey, the wheel, man!

32:42.859 --> 32:43.917
I'm sorry!
Chuck, hold him.

32:43.993 --> 32:45.153
Yeah! Yeah!

32:47.564 --> 32:49.156
Get him! Hold him down!

33:02.278 --> 33:04.712
Suki! Stupid cow. Sorry.

33:04.881 --> 33:06.542
Hey, may I help you?

33:06.616 --> 33:08.982
Yes, we're... We're...

33:09.752 --> 33:11.117
Gay?

33:11.187 --> 33:13.553
Yeah, we're marrying
each other.

33:13.623 --> 33:16.353
Gay. Civil or religious?

33:16.426 --> 33:17.825
Religious.

33:18.495 --> 33:20.326
I'm Jewish.
I don't wanna piss my mother off.

33:20.396 --> 33:22.796
I'm Catholic.
I don't want to piss Mel Gibson off.

33:22.866 --> 33:24.458
Come on.

33:24.534 --> 33:27.594
Religious is more expensive.
We have to hire a clergyman.

33:27.670 --> 33:29.763
Look, you know what?
We'll just do civil then, okay?

33:29.839 --> 33:31.879
- Will you at least wear a yarmulke?
- Yeah, okay, sure.

33:31.941 --> 33:32.941
It's important.

33:33.009 --> 33:34.033
Yeah, I will.

33:34.143 --> 33:38.239
We want a traditional wedding, too,
one with a lot of photographs for evidence.

33:40.049 --> 33:42.415
Evidence for our future children,

33:42.485 --> 33:44.419
so they can see
what a beautiful chapel this is.

33:44.487 --> 33:45.579
Yeah.

33:46.256 --> 33:47.587
That's nice.

33:47.657 --> 33:49.454
I think Chubb Rock needs a dress.
Am I right?

33:49.526 --> 33:51.206
That's okay. No, I'm fine. No.
Come on. No?

33:51.227 --> 33:53.525
Okay. What size?
Five times XL?

33:54.464 --> 33:56.125
No, no. That's...
That's fine, really. I'm...

33:56.199 --> 33:58.999
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go with a tux like Liza Minnelli.

33:59.068 --> 34:00.558
I saw her wear one
at the Oscars and it's just been...

34:00.637 --> 34:02.264
At least have garter belts
underneath, please?

34:02.338 --> 34:03.362
Okay.

34:03.439 --> 34:07.705
You will need to have a witness.
We can supply one for $100.

34:07.777 --> 34:10.610
Hundred doll hairs?
That's a lot of doll hairs.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.242
Come again?

34:12.315 --> 34:13.942
Do dolls come
with that many hairs?

34:14.016 --> 34:15.143
Doll hairs, like dollars.

34:15.217 --> 34:16.685
Doll hairs?

34:18.187 --> 34:20.951
Yeah. Yeah, he likes that.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.685
I had never heard that one.

34:27.263 --> 34:29.993
Okay, sorry, sorry.
Can I write that down?

34:30.065 --> 34:31.931
Yeah, go ahead.

34:32.302 --> 34:34.496
We'll... We'll get our own witness,
by the way, so...

34:34.571 --> 34:35.868
Yeah.
Don't worry about that.

34:35.938 --> 34:37.770
Will you be needing a room?

34:37.840 --> 34:39.034
- What?
- A loom?

34:39.108 --> 34:41.474
For romantic time together.

34:45.148 --> 34:47.139
Whoa, whoa. No, no, we're good.
We... No...

34:47.216 --> 34:48.614
We'll take two looms,
by the way.

34:48.685 --> 34:51.051
Yeah. We're old-fashioned.

34:51.888 --> 34:53.286
That's very nice.

34:54.791 --> 34:58.090
I will give you key
in case you want to sneak.

34:58.328 --> 35:00.057
- That's okay.
- Yeah.

35:00.396 --> 35:01.454
But I'll give you key.

35:01.531 --> 35:02.691
Okay.

35:03.166 --> 35:04.190
Do you have the rings?

35:04.267 --> 35:05.598
Yeah.

35:05.735 --> 35:09.136
Now, the rings are
a symbol of eternity,

35:09.205 --> 35:13.471
because in a ring there's no beginning,
there is no end

35:14.410 --> 35:15.968
'cause it's a circle.

35:16.045 --> 35:17.137
That's kind of nice.

35:17.213 --> 35:18.475
It's not like a triangle.

35:18.548 --> 35:21.210
Triangle has,
like, a corner in the ends.

35:21.284 --> 35:23.184
This one is a circle.

35:23.252 --> 35:24.310
Okay, we get it.

35:24.387 --> 35:25.649
Three corners.

35:25.722 --> 35:27.314
Please exchange the rings.

35:27.390 --> 35:29.483
- Larry, take that.
- All right, yeah.

35:29.559 --> 35:30.787
Thanks.

35:31.361 --> 35:33.522
Is a promise of your love
forever together...

35:33.596 --> 35:34.620
- Okay.
- Okay. Beautiful.

35:34.697 --> 35:35.959
- ...for all eternity.
- Okay.

35:36.032 --> 35:38.057
- Because it's a circle.
- Yeah, we heard about the circle.

35:38.134 --> 35:39.814
Yes, we're familiar with shapes.
We got it.

35:41.704 --> 35:44.969
I now pronounce you
husband and husband.

35:45.041 --> 35:47.032
You may kiss the husband.

35:57.086 --> 35:59.919
I don't know.
Hey, man, you just gotta do this.

35:59.989 --> 36:02.082
- What do you mean?
- We got to do it.

36:02.158 --> 36:03.216
Kiss the husband.

36:03.292 --> 36:04.782
Yeah, we heard you.

36:05.461 --> 36:07.861
Oh, come on. Let's just...

36:07.930 --> 36:10.398
He's gonna take a picture,
we just gotta do this.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.500
Mmm-hmm.

36:12.201 --> 36:13.201
Oh!

36:16.139 --> 36:17.697
That's how we roll
in our house, baby.

36:17.774 --> 36:18.968
Oh, yeah.

36:25.248 --> 36:26.715
Do you do me?

36:27.984 --> 36:30.680
Oh, you couldn't handle it,
little man.

36:32.321 --> 36:33.447
Yeah.

36:33.523 --> 36:36.083
I think your witness
piss himself.

36:44.901 --> 36:50.168
The wires are all in place,
and they have tapped all of our phones.

36:51.974 --> 36:54.465
The Chinese government
is in on it.

36:54.811 --> 36:58.474
And Elizabeth Taylor is Bigfoot.

37:00.883 --> 37:02.680
Turn off my brain.

37:02.852 --> 37:04.251
Hear, hear!
Hear, hear!

37:06.956 --> 37:09.424
There's a microphone
in the cake!

37:12.795 --> 37:14.319
They moved it.

37:15.231 --> 37:16.255
Yeah.

37:16.332 --> 37:18.892
He smell like
a dead water buffalo.

37:24.607 --> 37:26.438
Oh, yeah! Very Jewish!

37:40.823 --> 37:42.313
I've been hit!

37:42.391 --> 37:43.858
How you doing?

37:44.627 --> 37:46.254
He broke his leg.

37:48.231 --> 37:50.199
Hey, how come your maid
ain't helping us out?

37:50.266 --> 37:53.167
She's working on something else,
all right?

37:53.503 --> 37:54.902
Yeah, right.

37:55.004 --> 37:57.564
How you doing there,
Phil Collins?

37:57.640 --> 38:01.007
$800. $800, Bob Barker!

38:01.077 --> 38:02.704
<i>...retail price
without going over...</i>

38:02.779 --> 38:04.576
She's working hard
with Bob Barker.

38:04.647 --> 38:07.081
She doesn't like when you talk
during her shows. Come on.

38:07.150 --> 38:10.051
$750? Oh, my balls,
that's too low.

38:10.119 --> 38:13.316
Hey, Big Ragoo,
I smell your feet from here. I like it.

38:13.389 --> 38:14.389
Oh...

38:15.291 --> 38:17.259
He thinks my feet stink.

38:19.562 --> 38:21.325
Now, that's a stink.

38:23.099 --> 38:26.330
See, I knew you were gonna
overcook this, man. I told you.

38:26.402 --> 38:29.394
Hey, it's Salisbury steak, Emeril.
It's supposed to be black.

38:29.472 --> 38:30.871
It stinks like manure!

38:30.940 --> 38:32.805
Yeah, it's supposed to.

38:33.075 --> 38:35.908
I can't believe you're gonna
serve this to the kids. Shit.

38:35.978 --> 38:37.206
Hey, language!

38:37.280 --> 38:39.009
Okay, kids,
"shit" is a bad word.

38:39.081 --> 38:41.049
Seriously, though,
I am not eating this crap!

38:41.117 --> 38:43.017
If I'm living here,
I'm cooking.

38:43.085 --> 38:44.643
How long is Uncle Chuck staying?

38:44.720 --> 38:47.985
Just for a little bit, okay?
Until his apartment is fixed.

38:48.057 --> 38:49.718
What happened to your place?

38:49.792 --> 38:51.453
Roaches.

38:52.128 --> 38:53.993
Yeah, big giant roaches.

38:54.163 --> 38:55.289
They ate my dog.

38:55.364 --> 38:56.456
Bastards!

38:56.532 --> 38:57.692
Language!

38:57.767 --> 38:59.826
Roaches are so ewwy.

39:00.703 --> 39:02.864
Did you hear that?
Roaches are ewwy.

39:02.939 --> 39:05.737
"Ewwy" is another word not allowed said
in this house, okay?

39:05.808 --> 39:07.469
- I think ewwy's a nice word.
- Shut up.

39:07.543 --> 39:08.703
Ewwy!

39:09.111 --> 39:10.135
Funny.

39:16.319 --> 39:18.514
<i>The Reds never even came up
in the conversation.</i>

39:18.588 --> 39:22.024
<i>About five straight seasons
losing regular seasons,</i>

39:22.091 --> 39:25.254
<i>the franchise's worse such stretch
since the '50s.</i>

39:25.328 --> 39:28.889
<i>Yet heading into play today, the Reds
were tied for the best record in the bigs.</i>

39:28.965 --> 39:31.957
<i>They've got
everybody going except for...</i>

39:32.668 --> 39:34.108
<i>...who's eligible
to come off the DL,</i>

39:34.136 --> 39:36.297
<i>but hasn't fully recovered
from an inflamed tendon...</i>

39:36.372 --> 39:37.498
Real smooth.

39:37.573 --> 39:38.835
Why? What happened?

39:38.908 --> 39:40.102
You broke Tori's chair!

39:40.176 --> 39:41.700
No, no, no.
It was like that when I got here.

39:41.777 --> 39:43.972
I'm not kidding you.
I think she did it.

39:44.046 --> 39:45.775
What the hell is that
on your face?

39:45.848 --> 39:48.078
I'm exfoliating.
It's good for my skin.

39:48.150 --> 39:49.708
Hey, that's a great idea, man.

39:49.785 --> 39:51.616
In case the gay inspector comes by.

39:52.288 --> 39:54.916
Yeah, yeah,
that's why I was doing it.

39:55.691 --> 39:57.386
Daddy, help!

39:58.394 --> 39:59.588
Tori?

40:01.631 --> 40:03.963
Somebody left the seat up.

40:04.700 --> 40:05.928
Real smooth, again.

40:06.002 --> 40:07.469
Why? What happened now?

40:07.536 --> 40:09.800
It was like that when I got here.
She... She did it.

40:09.872 --> 40:11.100
Hey, it's okay, sweetheart.

40:11.173 --> 40:14.006
You see, Uncle Chuck, he's not used
to living in a house with a young lady.

40:14.076 --> 40:15.338
- True that.
- Come here, honey.

40:15.411 --> 40:18.869
Slow, slow, slow.
Don't leave her intestines in there.

40:20.917 --> 40:22.714
Whoa, whoa...

40:22.785 --> 40:25.379
Your father's just jealous
'cause he can't get his butt

40:25.454 --> 40:26.512
- in that thing.
- Yeah.

40:26.589 --> 40:28.523
He got his butt stuck
in a king-sized Jacuzzi one time.

40:28.591 --> 40:30.559
- I seen that.
- Stop.

40:30.626 --> 40:31.650
Hey, yeah.

40:31.727 --> 40:33.752
Uncle Chuck,
you left this in the kitchen.

40:33.829 --> 40:35.023
Hey, don't you look at that!

40:35.097 --> 40:36.462
- I didn't.
- Actually, you know what? Give me that.

40:36.532 --> 40:38.159
- Maybe he should look at it. See.
- Stop it, Chuck!

40:38.234 --> 40:40.964
No, no, no. This is an experiment.
Seriously.

40:42.138 --> 40:44.572
Eric, see how this
makes you feel.

40:45.374 --> 40:46.739
Open it up.

40:50.646 --> 40:52.978
All right,
that didn't go well.

40:59.121 --> 41:02.056
Yo, you got any tequila in this house?
I want to fall right asleep.

41:02.124 --> 41:03.648
No, I don't.

41:03.726 --> 41:05.956
What the hell is this?
You got a dog I don't know about?

41:06.028 --> 41:07.708
No, that's your bed.
I worked hard on that.

41:07.730 --> 41:10.494
That ain't a bed. That's a bed,
the thing you're about to cave in.

41:10.566 --> 41:12.864
No. Look, you're not
sleeping here, okay?

41:12.935 --> 41:15.165
Nobody's slept
on that side since Paula.

41:15.237 --> 41:16.761
But, sweetheart,
it's our honeymoon.

41:16.839 --> 41:19.137
Of course I'm sleeping
in the same bed as you.

41:19.208 --> 41:20.470
No.

41:20.543 --> 41:22.023
How about if I put
Paula's pajamas on?

41:22.078 --> 41:23.238
Would that get me
in the sack with you?

41:23.312 --> 41:25.405
Don't you dare touch her PJs.

41:25.481 --> 41:28.507
You're kidding me.
You still keep her PJs?

41:28.584 --> 41:30.313
That's sick, Larry. Seriously.

41:30.386 --> 41:31.444
All right.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.488
You gotta call the shrink.

41:33.556 --> 41:35.490
I'm coming in the bed, Larry.

41:35.558 --> 41:38.322
Whoa, look at this.
You made me a little bowling ball ashtray.

41:38.394 --> 41:40.487
That's sweet of you.
I'll smoke that in the morning.

41:40.563 --> 41:42.656
I don't feel comfortable with this,
buddy, at all.

41:42.732 --> 41:44.495
Would it help
if I gave you the pose?

41:44.567 --> 41:46.296
Hey, get your foot off
that side of the bed.

41:46.369 --> 41:47.734
Have some respect,
would you, please?

41:47.803 --> 41:50.533
Yeah, I'll be respectful.
You won't even know I'm here.

41:50.606 --> 41:52.039
Oh, God.
You won't know I'm here, okay?

41:52.108 --> 41:54.133
Why don't you turn the light off?
You won't even see me.

41:54.210 --> 41:55.768
I'm not around, Larry.

41:55.845 --> 41:59.110
Yeah. Yeah. See?
Yeah. Roll over.

41:59.782 --> 42:01.340
Make yourself comfortable.

42:02.051 --> 42:03.450
That's right.

42:07.289 --> 42:09.120
You got Cinemax in here?

42:09.191 --> 42:10.818
No, I do not.

42:10.893 --> 42:13.259
What the hell am I supposed to do
with this thing?

42:13.329 --> 42:17.425
Keep it away from me.

42:18.034 --> 42:21.367
Can you lend me your foot for a second?
I'm kidding.

42:26.275 --> 42:28.334
Larry.

42:29.578 --> 42:33.070
You betrayed me, Larry.

42:34.517 --> 42:39.045
You made a promise
no one would sleep on my side of...

42:39.121 --> 42:40.383
All right. Hey, hey, hey.

42:40.456 --> 42:42.424
- I swear to you, I will beat you...
- That wasn't me.

42:42.491 --> 42:44.425
- ...with the end table!
- Larry!

42:44.493 --> 42:45.517
Stop it, man.

42:45.594 --> 42:46.618
If it was me, I would stop it.

42:46.695 --> 42:48.492
It was someone else.

42:50.099 --> 42:51.657
It scared me, too, Larry.

42:55.905 --> 42:57.668
Good morning, Daddy.

42:58.874 --> 43:00.171
Oh, hey, kids.

43:00.242 --> 43:01.732
Good morning, Uncle Chuck.

43:02.411 --> 43:04.140
What's doing, guys?

43:04.246 --> 43:05.406
Good morning, Teresa.

43:05.481 --> 43:06.846
Great morning.

43:11.954 --> 43:13.979
Why is Teresa in the bed?

43:15.424 --> 43:18.757
She was just cleaning it. She was...
Great job, Teresa.

43:18.828 --> 43:21.388
Spotless. Thank you.
You can go now.

43:22.498 --> 43:24.090
Hey.

43:24.733 --> 43:26.894
Hey, this is what got us in trouble
in the first place.

43:27.903 --> 43:29.063
Oh, boy.

43:29.138 --> 43:31.072
Come on, kids,
fix me breakfast!

43:31.140 --> 43:32.801
Come on, come on, come on!

43:32.875 --> 43:34.308
You're gonna burn for that.

43:34.376 --> 43:35.866
Get Cinemax.

43:35.945 --> 43:37.435
While I'm sleeping
in the same bed?

43:37.513 --> 43:39.845
Hey, you weren't sleeping
the whole time.

43:39.915 --> 43:40.973
You threw in some moves.

43:41.050 --> 43:42.108
I did not!

43:42.184 --> 43:44.243
Yeah. Smell your thumb.

43:52.328 --> 43:54.159
Smells like plastic.

44:03.239 --> 44:04.831
Hey, big guy.

44:05.341 --> 44:09.038
Hey, what the hell you doing
going through our garbage?

44:09.111 --> 44:13.070
Oh, once it's out on the street
ready for pickup, it's public property.

44:14.350 --> 44:15.550
Lawrence Valentine, I presume?

44:15.618 --> 44:16.778
Yeah. That's me.

44:16.852 --> 44:19.821
Yeah, Clint Fitzer
from Financial Services.

44:20.623 --> 44:23.456
You know, funny thing, you put
these moving boxes out for recycling

44:23.526 --> 44:25.606
after you'd already been
living together for so long.

44:25.661 --> 44:27.094
I found that interesting.

44:28.464 --> 44:30.864
And your garbage,
Mr. Valentine,

44:30.933 --> 44:34.300
well, from my experience,
it's not very homosexual garbage.

44:34.503 --> 44:35.993
Can I see some
identification, please?

44:36.372 --> 44:38.272
Oh, that's just one zip away.

44:44.213 --> 44:49.276
Mr. Valentine, the law takes a dim view
of those who cheat the public coffers.

44:50.920 --> 44:53.889
A very dim view, big guy.

44:56.325 --> 44:57.417
Shit.

45:03.632 --> 45:04.860
What are you doing?

45:04.934 --> 45:06.128
I'm putting a pillowcase
on my pillow.

45:06.202 --> 45:07.567
Okay, you know what?
That's not a pillowcase.

45:07.636 --> 45:09.331
It's my underwear, you idiot.

45:10.906 --> 45:12.498
No!
Would you stop?

45:12.575 --> 45:15.908
I just ran into Clint Fitzer out front.
That big city investigator.

45:15.978 --> 45:17.843
The one that hot-ass lawyer
was talking about?

45:17.913 --> 45:19.234
We gotta make
this place more gay.

45:19.281 --> 45:20.305
More gay?

45:20.382 --> 45:22.782
Yeah. He went through our trash.
He says it's not gay enough.

45:22.851 --> 45:24.284
Well, let's gay
that shit up, then!

45:24.353 --> 45:26.321
Oh, God.
Gay trash.

45:26.455 --> 45:29.219
Gay trash... Gay trash...

45:29.291 --> 45:30.291
Let's see.

45:32.161 --> 45:33.651
Huh? Huh?

45:34.029 --> 45:36.327
Yeah. What else?

45:36.398 --> 45:38.798
<i>♪ Anything you can do, I can do better. ♪</i>

45:38.867 --> 45:41.859
<i>♪ I can do anything better than you. ♪</i>

45:41.971 --> 45:43.768
- Perfect.
- Hey!

45:44.406 --> 45:46.636
Eric, are those the cleats
I just bought you?

45:46.709 --> 45:49.576
Uncle Chuck helped me
turn them into tap shoes.

45:49.645 --> 45:50.726
<i>Yeah, he didn't get Pippin,</i>

45:50.779 --> 45:52.212
so we're gonna prime him
for his next audition.

45:52.281 --> 45:53.270
<i>For the Annie Get Your Gun thing.</i>

45:53.349 --> 45:55.840
Go ahead, tap away. Nice.

45:56.252 --> 45:58.447
Sinatra tap-danced, come on.

45:58.520 --> 46:00.715
Nice. Nice. Big finish.

46:01.190 --> 46:03.954
Yeah. You wanna throw him
in the garbage?

46:04.526 --> 46:05.686
I'm kidding. Come on.

46:07.396 --> 46:08.761
Think like a gay guy.
We're gay, we're gay.

46:08.831 --> 46:09.855
Come on, gay. Gay it up.

46:09.932 --> 46:11.092
Here we go. Look at this.
Gay. What else? Gay.

46:11.166 --> 46:12.758
Shampoo for permed hair.
That's pretty gay.

46:12.835 --> 46:13.995
- Put it in there.
- Okay.

46:14.069 --> 46:15.093
Bandages.

46:15.170 --> 46:16.637
It's too rugged.

46:16.705 --> 46:18.263
- Really?
- Q-tips, get Q-tips.

46:18.340 --> 46:21.605
Gay guys like clean ears
for the licking and whatnot. Smart.

46:21.677 --> 46:22.677
What do you got?

46:22.745 --> 46:23.939
Maxi Pads.

46:24.013 --> 46:26.072
Now we have vaginas?
Put it back.

46:26.148 --> 46:29.379
Get some Streisand shit or something.
Just walk away, man.

46:29.585 --> 46:33.544
Gay. Very gay. Über gay.

46:33.622 --> 46:35.954
The gayest.
And the mother ship.

46:41.096 --> 46:42.096
Oh...

46:42.631 --> 46:44.428
- Chuck!
- Alex.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.797
- Hi!
- Wow.

46:46.869 --> 46:50.635
Oh, hey, did Larry tell you that
I talked to him about Fitzer stopping by?

46:50.706 --> 46:52.901
That guy is an infection,
but don't you worry about it,

46:52.975 --> 46:54.056
'cause I'm gonna handle it.

46:54.109 --> 46:57.203
No, it's all good.
It's all gay all the way.

46:59.248 --> 47:01.341
Are you doing anything
on Saturday night?

47:01.417 --> 47:02.714
No. Why?

47:02.785 --> 47:06.346
Well, I'm involved with this group,
and it's our big fundraiser thing and...

47:06.422 --> 47:07.855
Look, I know it's
a little bit last-minute, but...

47:07.923 --> 47:11.017
No, no, no!
Hey! Let's do this.

47:11.093 --> 47:12.685
Let's party. Wow.

47:12.761 --> 47:14.251
Awesome. Awesome!
Please.

47:14.330 --> 47:15.456
Okay. It's gonna be a lot of fun.

47:15.531 --> 47:16.623
I'm sure.

47:16.699 --> 47:18.564
- Here's the info.
- Hell, yeah.

47:18.634 --> 47:21.660
And don't forget
to bring your husband.

47:21.737 --> 47:24.069
My, husband? Yes, of course.

47:24.707 --> 47:26.140
Don't go anywhere without him.

47:26.208 --> 47:29.177
He's like a...
He's like an infection, too.

47:31.146 --> 47:35.549
Are you gonna be bringing
your significant other person thing?

47:36.018 --> 47:37.986
Oh, I'm not gay,
if that's what you mean.

47:38.053 --> 47:40.920
And I just broke up
with my boyfriend, so...

47:42.057 --> 47:43.081
I mean...

47:44.193 --> 47:47.356
It's fine.
So am I gonna see you there?

47:47.529 --> 47:48.529
I'll be there.

47:48.597 --> 47:49.655
Okay.

47:49.732 --> 47:52.132
- Oh, you wanna go?
- Yeah.

47:52.201 --> 47:53.964
- See you.
- Yeah.

47:56.505 --> 47:58.268
Hell, yeah!

47:59.274 --> 48:01.640
Sorry, did you say something?

48:01.710 --> 48:06.909
No, they got K-Y jelly,
two for $1. Hell, yeah.

48:08.417 --> 48:09.884
Okay. Bye.

48:09.952 --> 48:11.385
Bye.

48:14.923 --> 48:16.686
Yeah, this does work.

48:20.996 --> 48:22.691
Got some mail for you,
Mr. Valentine.

48:22.765 --> 48:25.632
Oh, okay. Thanks, Ron.

48:27.836 --> 48:28.996
Something I can do for you?

48:29.071 --> 48:32.097
I couldn't help overhearing
you and Mr. Levine

48:32.174 --> 48:35.007
talking about your arrangement
the other day.

48:35.077 --> 48:38.877
Yeah, we're a couple, so...

48:38.947 --> 48:43.543
Right. I also caught
a bit of what you said pertaining to me.

48:43.652 --> 48:44.676
What? I'm sorry?

48:44.753 --> 48:49.053
I heard you mention to the gentleman
that you thought I was a hottie.

48:49.124 --> 48:52.855
Oh. Yeah, you know what?
I'm sorry if that came off a little weird.

48:52.928 --> 48:54.623
- I was feeling...
- Oh, no, no, no.

48:54.696 --> 48:56.288
It's nothing to worry about, sir.

48:57.099 --> 48:58.099
I don't bite.

48:59.435 --> 49:00.732
Oh, okay.

49:01.003 --> 49:02.493
Listen, just so you know,

49:02.571 --> 49:04.436
if you're ever home alone
in the afternoons.

49:05.307 --> 49:06.638
I make drop-offs.

49:07.443 --> 49:08.501
Yeah.

49:08.577 --> 49:09.976
And I always deliver.

49:10.045 --> 49:12.707
You know what?
I'm pretty loyal to Chuck.

49:12.781 --> 49:15.545
Right, I understand that.
I'm just saying if you ever want to

49:15.617 --> 49:19.417
explore your other feelings,
there's no extra postage.

49:19.521 --> 49:21.648
And it's always first-class.

49:21.723 --> 49:24.590
All right. Anything else you feel
you need to say, there?

49:24.660 --> 49:25.786
I handle with care.

49:25.861 --> 49:27.385
Okay, Ron, thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

49:27.463 --> 49:29.260
And I'd be happy to come in
through the back door.

49:29.331 --> 49:31.424
I'm sure you would.

49:31.500 --> 49:33.331
Used to holding
large packages.

49:40.909 --> 49:42.774
This actually ain't
gonna be bad, man.

49:42.845 --> 49:45.370
Just some regular
gay folks having a party.

49:47.616 --> 49:50.210
I'm dirty! Who's dirty?
Are you...

49:52.855 --> 49:55.119
Oh, my God, it's Homopalooza.

50:01.730 --> 50:04.722
You know what? Find Alex, say hello,
and let's get the hell out of here.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.233
I'm going to take a leak.

50:06.301 --> 50:08.064
You're gonna go
to the men's room? Here?

50:08.437 --> 50:09.529
What's wrong with that?

50:09.605 --> 50:11.573
I peed three times
before I got here.

50:11.874 --> 50:12.874
I'll be fine.

50:12.941 --> 50:14.238
Apple martini?

50:26.688 --> 50:28.815
Oh, yeah. There's my lawyer.

50:35.998 --> 50:37.863
Look at that. Perfection.

50:40.168 --> 50:42.693
I want to suck your blood.

50:44.039 --> 50:45.700
Suck my what?

50:47.009 --> 50:48.704
Nothing.

50:48.777 --> 50:50.745
It's cool.
You want to suck something.

50:50.812 --> 50:53.906
I was talking to somebody else.

50:53.982 --> 50:55.847
Hey! Don't go, bitch!

50:56.885 --> 50:58.512
Don't be a tease!

50:59.621 --> 51:00.952
You whore!

51:09.097 --> 51:10.655
Hello?

51:13.669 --> 51:15.227
Anybody here?

51:19.641 --> 51:22.872
Oh, my God.
All right, let's do this.

51:37.559 --> 51:40.995
Chuck! Hey!
Oh, I'm so glad you made it.

51:41.496 --> 51:43.088
Alex? That's you, right?

51:43.165 --> 51:44.928
Yeah. I'm Catwoman.

51:47.502 --> 51:49.026
Wow, so...

51:49.104 --> 51:52.073
I had no idea Dracula
could look so fierce.

51:52.140 --> 51:54.074
I like Betty Butterfly the most.

51:54.142 --> 51:57.441
On, Stevie! On, Bobby! On, Sarah!

51:57.512 --> 51:59.537
That's my brother, Kevin.

51:59.615 --> 52:00.809
He's your brother?
You're related to him?

52:00.882 --> 52:01.940
Yes.

52:02.017 --> 52:04.485
He's gotta come out of the closet already.
I feel bad.

52:04.553 --> 52:07.113
It must eat him up inside
knowing he's got so many secrets.

52:07.189 --> 52:08.417
Shut up.

52:12.127 --> 52:14.891
My underwear's
just riding up my core.

52:15.397 --> 52:17.592
Seriously, I got some applesauce
going on down there.

52:17.666 --> 52:20.032
I can't wait to launder
that load.

52:20.102 --> 52:21.729
What's up, apple dumpling?
What's crack-a-lacking?

52:21.803 --> 52:24.863
What's crack-a-what?
I'm sorry, who are you? Do I know you?

52:24.940 --> 52:27.408
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm Kevin,
Alex's brother.

52:27.476 --> 52:29.410
Oh, hey, man.
What's up, man?

52:29.511 --> 52:30.705
Larry, Chuck's better half.

52:30.779 --> 52:31.939
Oh, wow.

52:32.014 --> 52:34.107
Better two-thirds, actually.

52:34.349 --> 52:36.544
So, I got a question.
I know you know it's coming.

52:36.618 --> 52:38.677
- I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it!
- Don't do it. Don't do it.

52:38.754 --> 52:40.381
Who's pitching
and who's catching?

52:40.455 --> 52:43.822
You mean who's the chick
and who's the guy and that kind of thing?

52:43.892 --> 52:46.793
Please don't feel obligated to answer that.
It's none of our business.

52:46.862 --> 52:47.954
I know it's not,
but it's fun to know.

52:48.030 --> 52:50.828
Really not a problem. Let's see.
This is gonna be a cool experiment.

52:50.899 --> 52:52.924
Who do you think
is the chick out of us two?

52:53.001 --> 52:55.595
One, two, three. Chuck!
One, two, three. Chuck!

52:55.671 --> 52:57.161
- So Chuck!
- I know.

52:57.239 --> 52:58.866
What do you mean, Chuck?

52:59.775 --> 53:02.243
Why would you think
I'm the chick?

53:02.310 --> 53:03.777
Well, he's an apple.

53:03.845 --> 53:06.245
Very masculine.
Very solid fruit.

53:06.314 --> 53:09.613
And you're Count Suckula
with a straw in your beard.

53:09.685 --> 53:12.916
I'm drinking through a straw
'cause I don't want to smear my lipstick.

53:12.988 --> 53:15.684
Oh, yeah, that was worse. All right.
Good, good, good. Okay.

53:15.757 --> 53:19.193
I also think it's because
you have very sweet, sensitive eyes.

53:19.261 --> 53:22.424
And that's very rare
to find in a guy.

53:22.497 --> 53:25.330
Well, you have very sweet
and sensitive eyes, too.

53:25.400 --> 53:26.458
I do?

53:26.535 --> 53:27.975
Us chicks should
stick together, huh?

53:28.003 --> 53:29.493
Take it easy, buddy.

53:29.571 --> 53:32.267
Girls rule and boys drool.

53:32.340 --> 53:33.830
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:33.909 --> 53:35.206
Oh, my God!

53:35.277 --> 53:36.835
You okay? Breathe!

53:37.079 --> 53:38.103
This is my jam!

53:38.180 --> 53:40.861
This is my jam! You know that!
This is my jam! Watch my drink, okay?

53:41.095 --> 53:43.086
- Okay, okay.
- It's my jam!

53:44.331 --> 53:45.628
- So?
- Yo.

53:46.133 --> 53:47.760
You gonna show me your moves?

53:49.269 --> 53:52.067
Oh, my God,
she got the flags out.

53:52.139 --> 53:53.697
I can't dance for shit.
Can you?

53:53.774 --> 53:55.036
Hell, no.

53:59.146 --> 54:02.377
Look at these guys, man.
They're freaking Travoltas!

54:04.051 --> 54:08.010
Gay guys know how to dance good.
It's like the law or some shit.

54:10.924 --> 54:12.551
Get in the circle right now!

54:12.626 --> 54:13.888
Yeah, it's gonna be a blast.

54:13.961 --> 54:15.292
Any second, man.
Glad to be here.

54:15.362 --> 54:17.330
I can't wait. I can't wait!

54:17.965 --> 54:19.592
Look at this.

54:19.666 --> 54:22.863
Hey, the butterfly's coming
out of his cocoon again.

54:24.738 --> 54:26.399
That's my brother!

54:26.473 --> 54:28.668
This is his jam!
It is his jam.

54:32.379 --> 54:33.437
Kevin's having fun.

54:33.514 --> 54:34.776
I didn't need to see that.

54:35.682 --> 54:37.013
I'm flying!

54:37.084 --> 54:38.165
We gotta look good at this.

54:38.218 --> 54:39.344
It's showtime, boys!

54:39.420 --> 54:40.580
Whoa!

54:41.922 --> 54:42.980
I'm sorry!

54:43.056 --> 54:44.148
No, it's part of it.

54:44.224 --> 54:47.785
All right, Larry, get up.
That's it, that's it, that's it.

54:50.864 --> 54:53.094
We're busted, dude,
we're busted.

54:53.167 --> 54:55.158
Let's go junior high on their ass.

54:55.235 --> 54:56.293
Junior high?

54:56.503 --> 54:58.130
Yeah. Let's do this.

54:58.205 --> 54:59.433
Okay.

55:13.854 --> 55:15.378
Is it working?

55:15.456 --> 55:18.687
I don't know.
I'm afraid to look up.

55:18.759 --> 55:20.818
I think it is.
I think it is.

55:32.439 --> 55:34.168
Oh, my God.

55:34.341 --> 55:36.741
We really pulled this one
out of our asses.

55:37.144 --> 55:41.240
Bad choice of words, there, Larry.
Bad choice of words.

55:45.185 --> 55:47.915
Hey, Chuck, Larry. We got a basketball
game every Tuesday night at 6:00.

55:47.988 --> 55:50.183
If you guys want to play,
the butterfly knows how to get hold of us.

55:50.257 --> 55:52.987
Okay, right on. Thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, we'll give you a buzz.

55:53.060 --> 55:54.254
Nice to meet you guys.

55:54.328 --> 55:58.287
<i>Sinners and fornicators!
We are not here in anger!</i>

55:58.365 --> 56:01.425
<i>We are here to save you
from eternal damnation!</i>

56:02.636 --> 56:03.694
Hey, buddy!

56:03.770 --> 56:06.398
Wait, come on already!
This is a private event.

56:06.473 --> 56:07.735
Now, give it a rest.

56:07.808 --> 56:11.300
<i>Aren't you worried about
where you'll spend eternity?</i>

56:11.411 --> 56:13.311
This is what these guys do
on a Saturday night?

56:13.380 --> 56:16.076
They just want everyone to be
as miserable as they are.

56:16.149 --> 56:21.052
Gay is not the way!
Gay is not the way! Gay is not the way!

56:21.622 --> 56:22.782
It's over, baby.

56:22.856 --> 56:24.790
Gay is not the way!
Gay is not the way!

56:24.858 --> 56:29.591
Hey, hey! You heard the man.
It's a private party, so take a walk.

56:29.663 --> 56:32.860
This is a public sidewalk.
We have every right to be here!

56:32.933 --> 56:34.560
And we have every right
to be queer!

56:34.635 --> 56:36.068
Yeah!

56:37.771 --> 56:42.401
<i>Homosexuality is
an abomination.</i>

56:42.776 --> 56:46.405
Hey, news flash, man.
That jacket's an abomination.

56:47.014 --> 56:50.279
- Gay is the way! Gay is the way!
- Gay is not the way!

56:50.784 --> 56:53.480
Hey, what makes you think
that you have the right to dictate

56:53.554 --> 56:54.953
how other people
live their lives?

56:55.022 --> 56:57.991
I'm a minister.
I'm allowed to preach in any public forum.

56:58.058 --> 56:59.389
Well, I'm a fireman.

56:59.459 --> 57:02.259
I say you're blocking emergency access,
so let's call it a night, guys.

57:02.329 --> 57:04.991
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You're a fireman?

57:05.065 --> 57:07.226
You are a disgrace!

57:07.301 --> 57:09.792
<i>You're a flamer,
is what you are.</i>

57:09.903 --> 57:11.928
- All right, oh, my God.
- There's no reasoning with these people.

57:12.005 --> 57:14.439
Just let it go. Just let it go.
Just let it go.

57:14.508 --> 57:16.271
Come on, come on.
Let it go, guys.

57:16.343 --> 57:18.243
Have a good day.
See you later.

57:18.312 --> 57:19.677
Faggots.

57:20.414 --> 57:22.245
I'm sorry?
What did you call me?

57:22.649 --> 57:24.640
Oh, I called you a faggot.

57:25.719 --> 57:27.016
<i>Faggot.</i>

57:30.824 --> 57:34.817
For your information,
the accepted vernacular is "gay."

57:37.831 --> 57:41.892
Homos, one. Crazy people, zero.
Official score.

57:48.909 --> 57:50.877
Gentlemen, I have
a very simple philosophy.

57:50.944 --> 57:52.824
What you shove up your ass
is your own business.

57:52.879 --> 57:54.540
- Captain...
- Shut up.

57:54.615 --> 57:58.608
Now, it's not my style to get involved
in the personal lives of my firemen.

57:58.685 --> 57:59.777
And if sometimes I've given you

57:59.853 --> 58:02.413
the impression that I'm your friend,
I apologize.

58:03.490 --> 58:08.223
However, I seriously doubt
that you two are banging each other.

58:08.295 --> 58:11.822
You and Paula, the most beautiful couple
I ever laid eyes on.

58:11.898 --> 58:16.028
And you, if my pencil sharpener
had a skirt, I'd have to hide it.

58:16.903 --> 58:21.203
Look, do you have any idea of the stress
an administrative position entails?

58:21.274 --> 58:23.504
I've already got
a prostate the size of a cantaloupe.

58:23.577 --> 58:24.771
And now, thanks to you two bozos,

58:24.845 --> 58:27.507
I've got the Pension Department
pissing up my chimney,

58:27.581 --> 58:29.515
not to mention every flaming fruit bat
south of Poughkeepsie

58:29.583 --> 58:32.609
that wants to come down here to our house
and slide up and down our pole!

58:32.686 --> 58:34.483
- We should tell him the truth.
- We'll tell him the truth.

58:34.554 --> 58:36.522
- We'll tell him the truth.
- lx-nay on the uth-tray!

58:36.590 --> 58:38.080
I don't want to hear about it.

58:38.158 --> 58:40.149
And if this marriage is
something you've cooked up

58:40.227 --> 58:43.685
in response to this pension problem,
you are not taking me down with you.

58:43.764 --> 58:45.527
I will report you.
You will go to jail,

58:45.599 --> 58:46.998
where you won't have
to pretend to be gay,

58:47.067 --> 58:50.298
because your asses'll be busier
than a test bench in a plunger factory.

58:54.174 --> 58:57.041
I just wanted to thank you again
for what you did at the fundraiser.

58:57.110 --> 58:59.635
Oh, yeah,
that was no big deal.

58:59.713 --> 59:01.874
You sound a little down.
Where's Larry?

59:01.948 --> 59:05.543
He's at school with the kids,
doing the Career Day thing.

59:05.619 --> 59:08.247
So does that mean that you can have
a girl's day with me?

59:08.321 --> 59:09.515
<i>- A girl's day?
- Yeah.</i>

59:09.589 --> 59:11.887
<i>I need some new shoes,
new underwear.</i>

59:11.958 --> 59:13.084
Girl's day!

59:13.160 --> 59:14.218
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

59:16.430 --> 59:19.092
Girl's day! Sure.

59:20.467 --> 59:22.162
I'll pick you up.

01:00:41.281 --> 01:00:46.344
So, by trading in
pre-refunded municipal bonds,

01:00:46.419 --> 01:00:50.583
we can offer our clients
triple tax-exempt returns.

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:53.050
Any questions?

01:00:55.962 --> 01:00:57.930
There never are.

01:00:57.998 --> 01:01:02.025
Thank you, Mr. Auerbach,
for that very nice trip down Wall Street.

01:01:02.102 --> 01:01:05.833
Our next parent is Larry Valentine,
Tori's father.

01:01:05.906 --> 01:01:08.568
Hi, everybody!
I am a firefighter,

01:01:09.142 --> 01:01:12.475
and I'm proud to be one because
it's my job to protect the community

01:01:12.546 --> 01:01:15.709
and make sure
it's a safe environment for all.

01:01:15.816 --> 01:01:18.341
Whoa!
We got some questions already.

01:01:20.754 --> 01:01:22.016
Yeah.

01:01:22.088 --> 01:01:26.047
I don't like girls, either.
Does that mean I'm gay, too?

01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:30.854
No, no.

01:01:32.032 --> 01:01:34.023
You were married
to a woman, right?

01:01:34.668 --> 01:01:35.692
Yes.

01:01:35.769 --> 01:01:38.203
Does that mean
you're half-lesbian?

01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:42.207
Kids, Mr. Valentine is here to talk
about his career today, okay?

01:01:42.275 --> 01:01:44.800
Mr. Valentine?
You said you're a fireman.

01:01:44.878 --> 01:01:46.038
Yes, that is correct.

01:01:46.112 --> 01:01:47.477
Do you have two jobs?

01:01:47.547 --> 01:01:50.812
Because my dad said
that you're also a butt pirate.

01:01:56.456 --> 01:01:57.684
Larry.

01:01:57.757 --> 01:01:59.054
Steve.

01:01:59.459 --> 01:02:00.517
Rough crowd, huh?

01:02:00.594 --> 01:02:02.027
Kids.
Yeah.

01:02:02.095 --> 01:02:05.826
So, listen. We're all set
for the Boy Scout overnight this month.

01:02:05.899 --> 01:02:07.196
Oh, great. We're all set?

01:02:08.268 --> 01:02:11.533
No, we're all set,
like we don't need any more fathers.

01:02:11.605 --> 01:02:14.403
All right, well, then, I guess I'll see you
at Little League, then, all right?

01:02:14.474 --> 01:02:16.704
Oh, you know what?
We're good.

01:02:17.244 --> 01:02:18.336
We are good.

01:02:18.411 --> 01:02:19.935
No, no, no, we're not good.

01:02:20.647 --> 01:02:23.207
We don't need you for Little League.
We're good.

01:02:23.283 --> 01:02:27.185
Okay, Steve, what's going on?
I signed up to coach three months ago.

01:02:27.254 --> 01:02:31.054
Larry, I don't want to get into this
with you here.

01:02:31.124 --> 01:02:34.560
Hey, you know what, Steve?
You're really starting to piss me off.

01:02:34.628 --> 01:02:37.290
I'm trying to get Eric
interested in baseball.

01:02:37.364 --> 01:02:39.628
That kid interested
in baseball?

01:02:39.699 --> 01:02:41.826
You got a better chance getting
Colonel Sanders interested

01:02:41.902 --> 01:02:44.029
in a hamburger, buddy.

01:02:48.308 --> 01:02:50.538
Fight! Fight! Fight!

01:02:53.713 --> 01:02:56.204
Your dad's gay and so are you.

01:03:04.691 --> 01:03:06.454
Oh, my hair!
Oh, my hair, my hair!

01:03:06.526 --> 01:03:07.720
Oh, my clothes!

01:03:07.794 --> 01:03:09.386
Oh, am I frizzy?
I'm getting frizzy!

01:03:09.462 --> 01:03:14.229
You asshole! Go back to Jersey!
You can go back to Jersey!

01:03:14.301 --> 01:03:17.737
Come on, honey!
Please open the door!

01:03:21.107 --> 01:03:24.008
Whoa, nice pad.

01:03:24.077 --> 01:03:25.476
Oh, thank you.

01:03:25.679 --> 01:03:29.171
Hey, you are soaked. Do you want to borrow
a sweatshirt or something?

01:03:29.249 --> 01:03:31.809
No, no. I'm great, I'm great.
Thank you.

01:03:31.885 --> 01:03:33.716
Okay, but I am freezing, so...

01:03:38.425 --> 01:03:39.449
What are you doing there?

01:03:39.526 --> 01:03:40.925
Well, it's wet.

01:03:48.768 --> 01:03:51.293
Actually, you know what?
I'll take that sweatshirt.

01:03:51.371 --> 01:03:52.565
Oh, yeah.

01:03:54.941 --> 01:03:56.101
Thanks.

01:04:06.086 --> 01:04:09.419
So, that's a great body
you got there. I mean,

01:04:10.323 --> 01:04:12.484
it could be the best body
I've ever seen in my life.

01:04:12.559 --> 01:04:13.821
Shut up.

01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:16.088
Besides Larry's. But yours...

01:04:17.464 --> 01:04:20.160
Your tush looks like
it's made of muscle,

01:04:20.233 --> 01:04:22.827
and Larry's is made of pudding
and Quarter Pounders

01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:24.597
and God knows what.

01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:27.231
Well, these are real, by the way.
I mean, nobody thinks they are.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.868
Everyone thinks they're fake,
but they are real.

01:04:29.943 --> 01:04:34.004
Alex. You don't gotta lie to me.
We're two girls hanging out. Come on.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.776
You kidding me?
There's no silicone here, I swear.

01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:39.819
Oh, no big deal if they are or not.
I don't care.

01:04:39.886 --> 01:04:42.218
I've got nothing to hide.
Feel them.

01:04:42.956 --> 01:04:44.719
- Feel them?
- Feel them.

01:04:45.291 --> 01:04:46.849
I mean, I...

01:04:49.295 --> 01:04:50.990
I have a...

01:04:51.064 --> 01:04:55.262
I'd rather feel a flabby man pec,
to be honest with you,

01:04:55.335 --> 01:04:57.633
but in the name of science,
if you need me to hold

01:04:57.704 --> 01:05:00.605
your bodacious Bahama mamas,

01:05:00.673 --> 01:05:03.005
or whatever the guys call them nowadays,
I'll do it.

01:05:03.076 --> 01:05:04.737
- Yes, go ahead.
- Oh!

01:05:07.614 --> 01:05:09.104
Well?

01:05:09.182 --> 01:05:11.047
Yeah, they're real.

01:05:11.918 --> 01:05:13.146
Told you.

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:14.648
And creamy.

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:18.852
And fun.

01:05:19.759 --> 01:05:21.886
For someone who would like
something like this, this is...

01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:24.088
But to me, it's, like, ew.

01:05:24.631 --> 01:05:27.759
I just got a little nauseous there,
touching them. That's funny.

01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:29.426
You want a bite?

01:05:30.336 --> 01:05:32.361
No, no, no.
Feeling them's enough.

01:05:32.806 --> 01:05:33.830
I'll do that again.

01:05:33.907 --> 01:05:37.274
No, no, I meant food.
Are you hungry?

01:05:37.343 --> 01:05:39.868
Oh! I'm sorry.

01:05:39.946 --> 01:05:41.937
Yeah, no... Just...

01:05:42.849 --> 01:05:44.407
That was funny.

01:05:55.562 --> 01:05:57.029
Nice, nice.

01:05:59.966 --> 01:06:02.901
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Me and Nootzie against you three guys.

01:06:02.969 --> 01:06:04.436
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:05.138 --> 01:06:06.628
You don't want to play?

01:06:07.373 --> 01:06:09.466
Hey, Chuckie,
I gotta be honest with you.

01:06:09.542 --> 01:06:12.773
You play real physical defense,
and none of us want you copping a feel

01:06:12.846 --> 01:06:15.940
or rubbing up against
the old boosh-cadoosh here.

01:06:16.182 --> 01:06:18.980
Just 'cause you're gay doesn't mean
that you're horny for every guy you meet.

01:06:19.052 --> 01:06:21.350
Oh, really? 'Cause every time
you covered me in the past,

01:06:21.421 --> 01:06:23.355
I feel like you were
grab-assing on me.

01:06:23.423 --> 01:06:26.915
Yeah. Let the WNBA play.
Come on.

01:06:28.128 --> 01:06:29.390
Fine, go.

01:06:31.297 --> 01:06:32.889
Unbelievable.

01:06:43.743 --> 01:06:44.971
Oh, God.

01:06:45.645 --> 01:06:47.272
What, you want
to mess with me, too?

01:06:47.947 --> 01:06:50.108
Huh? You want to mess
with the queer?

01:06:50.183 --> 01:06:53.016
'Cause this queer don't take shit
from nobody. Let's go, then.

01:06:53.086 --> 01:06:56.817
You ready? I'm a fireman, man!
I ain't afraid of nothing!

01:06:58.558 --> 01:07:00.321
Put your fists down.

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.608
Me, too.

01:07:22.315 --> 01:07:23.475
You, too?

01:07:24.551 --> 01:07:25.551
You, too, what?

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.848
I'm gay.

01:07:31.824 --> 01:07:34.258
I can't believe
I finally said it.

01:07:36.229 --> 01:07:38.322
Oh, God, it feels so good.

01:07:38.531 --> 01:07:41.159
It's just like a wave
is crashing over me.

01:07:43.636 --> 01:07:45.263
It's so liberating.

01:07:45.338 --> 01:07:46.669
Oh, yeah.

01:07:48.908 --> 01:07:52.275
Do you remember
the first time you said it?

01:07:52.812 --> 01:07:55.781
First time I said... Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:55.848 --> 01:07:57.748
I was with Larry.

01:07:57.817 --> 01:07:59.512
- Your lover.
- Yeah.

01:08:00.153 --> 01:08:02.644
Who, by the way,
is absolutely gorgeous.

01:08:02.722 --> 01:08:04.519
Oh, thanks.

01:08:04.591 --> 01:08:06.559
He's mine, though, so...

01:08:06.626 --> 01:08:08.355
Oh, no, that's your man.

01:08:08.428 --> 01:08:09.428
Mmm-hmm.

01:08:09.495 --> 01:08:10.621
Yeah.

01:08:10.697 --> 01:08:13.825
My whole life
I've been living a lie.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:17.961
But you and Larry have given me
the strength to be true to myself.

01:08:18.604 --> 01:08:20.630
"To thine own self be true."

01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:26.907
There's nothing worse than pretending
to be something that you're not.

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:31.781
Yeah. Yeah, well, I'm glad.
I'm glad we helped you out,

01:08:32.385 --> 01:08:35.183
and anything else we can do,
you don't hesitate to ask.

01:08:35.488 --> 01:08:39.049
Would you help me
tell my parents?

01:08:40.093 --> 01:08:41.117
I guess.

01:08:41.194 --> 01:08:42.388
Yes!

01:08:42.462 --> 01:08:44.589
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:08:44.663 --> 01:08:46.393
Oh, yes, yes, yes, girl!

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.626
Hey, did you guys catch
that Mets game last night?

01:08:50.703 --> 01:08:53.604
They got a shot of my cousin
throwing a beer at the ump.

01:08:53.673 --> 01:08:56.267
I missed it. Took my sister
to the electrolysis place

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:57.673
for a second opinion.

01:08:57.743 --> 01:08:59.404
They said there's nothing
they could do.

01:09:01.814 --> 01:09:03.805
What the hell is so funny?

01:09:30.475 --> 01:09:32.068
No!

01:09:48.795 --> 01:09:49.853
Pick that up, would you?

01:09:49.929 --> 01:09:51.725
I ain't picking that up!

01:09:51.798 --> 01:09:54.528
You want my soap, Renaldo?
Right here.

01:09:57.537 --> 01:09:58.936
Hey, Tony, give me your soap.

01:09:59.005 --> 01:10:01.098
No. I don't share soap.
Too many germies.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.832
Come on, give me the
damn bar of soap!

01:10:02.942 --> 01:10:04.273
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

01:10:11.818 --> 01:10:13.479
Who's gonna do it?

01:10:41.214 --> 01:10:42.943
Hey, how you doing?

01:10:45.218 --> 01:10:46.617
Hey, Duncan.

01:10:48.154 --> 01:10:50.452
I'll tell you about that later.

01:10:55.561 --> 01:11:00.521
<i>♪ 'Cause I'm every woman ♪
♪ It's all in me. ♪</i>

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.730

01:11:16.749 --> 01:11:18.683

<i>♪ I can't hear you sing. ♪</i>

01:11:32.532 --> 01:11:33.897
All right, yours is done.

01:11:33.966 --> 01:11:35.661
Yours, too.

01:11:35.735 --> 01:11:37.259
All right, take a look.
Okay.

01:11:37.336 --> 01:11:39.304
"Girlz Rule" with a "Z."

01:11:39.372 --> 01:11:40.862
This is so awesome.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:41.964
I hope you like yours.

01:11:42.041 --> 01:11:43.406
Let's see here.

01:11:43.976 --> 01:11:46.001
"Friends forever."

01:11:47.013 --> 01:11:49.504
Anything with forever and you in it
sounds pretty good to me.

01:11:49.582 --> 01:11:52.142
This is great.
Just slide her on.

01:11:52.218 --> 01:11:54.118
You know what's
still bugging me, though?

01:11:54.187 --> 01:11:57.418
That those Guidos wouldn't even
let you play basketball with them.

01:11:57.490 --> 01:12:00.948
We could get a court order
and have them suspended in two seconds.

01:12:01.027 --> 01:12:03.461
Court order? No, no, no.
These guys are good guys.

01:12:03.529 --> 01:12:05.759
They're just having
problems adjusting.

01:12:06.165 --> 01:12:08.099
Calm down. Relax.
Finish your wine.

01:12:08.167 --> 01:12:09.498
Come on.

01:12:09.569 --> 01:12:11.127
Okay.

01:12:15.842 --> 01:12:17.571
- You're right. You're right.
- Yeah.

01:12:17.643 --> 01:12:20.578
But you know what would really
help me to relax?

01:12:22.648 --> 01:12:24.047
Is a foot rub.

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:28.584
Please. Please.
You'll be my bestest friend.

01:12:29.422 --> 01:12:32.755
Oh, they're good.
Yeah, I can handle it. Give me these.

01:12:33.826 --> 01:12:36.886
You know, I love that you're
a chubby chaser, by the way.

01:12:36.963 --> 01:12:38.157
A chubby what-what?

01:12:38.231 --> 01:12:40.256
Well, you know,
Larry's heavyset.

01:12:40.333 --> 01:12:43.825
I mean, is that the type of guy
you've always been attracted to?

01:12:44.904 --> 01:12:47.805
No, he's my first fatty.

01:12:48.508 --> 01:12:52.376
Yeah, you guys really seem
like you have a lot of sexual chemistry.

01:12:52.445 --> 01:12:54.936
I float his boat
and he sinks mine.

01:12:55.414 --> 01:13:00.750
Yeah, I've never had that, really had that,
with anybody before. I just...

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.220
I don't even know
if I know what I'm doing.

01:13:03.289 --> 01:13:04.289
What?

01:13:04.357 --> 01:13:06.689
I'm serious. Come on.

01:13:07.627 --> 01:13:10.562
Give me some moves.
How do you turn Larry on?

01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:13.330
How do I turn Larry on?

01:13:15.067 --> 01:13:19.333
I mean, to get him into bed, of course,
I just lay a pizza out...

01:13:19.405 --> 01:13:20.929
- No!
- ...and he comes running.

01:13:21.007 --> 01:13:22.531
Really. Seriously.

01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:29.409
Well, he likes it
when I rub his big, hairy earlobe.

01:13:29.949 --> 01:13:31.382
That gets him crazy.

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:32.474
Really?

01:13:32.552 --> 01:13:34.281
Yeah, it's a spot of his.

01:13:35.087 --> 01:13:36.384
Try it on me.

01:13:36.455 --> 01:13:37.752
- Try it on you?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:13:37.823 --> 01:13:38.915
Yeah.

01:13:38.991 --> 01:13:40.959
You know, I just grab it and...

01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:46.898
Usually when I do this to Larry,
he's like, boing! You know?

01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.258
- I love it.
- You do?

01:13:49.335 --> 01:13:50.768
Yeah. Like that?

01:13:50.836 --> 01:13:53.566
Sure, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah,
work both hands. I like that.

01:13:53.639 --> 01:13:56.403
And then you can go to some hair-pulling,
right about like that.

01:13:56.475 --> 01:13:57.533
- Like that?
- Yeah.

01:13:57.610 --> 01:13:59.737
Oh, yeah, let him know you're there,
know what I mean?

01:13:59.812 --> 01:14:01.712
And then the slap out
of nowhere is good.

01:14:01.781 --> 01:14:03.544
- That is good.
- Uh-huh.

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:07.178
Yeah. Not Ultimate Fighting
kind of smacking.

01:14:07.253 --> 01:14:10.017
Just light and sexual and fun.
Sorry.

01:14:10.089 --> 01:14:12.853
How did you get to be
so good at all this?

01:14:12.925 --> 01:14:15.723
I don't know.
A lot of practice I guess.

01:14:15.795 --> 01:14:19.128
I used to be kind of a jerk.

01:14:19.198 --> 01:14:23.259
But then you meet
somebody special

01:14:23.336 --> 01:14:26.237
who makes you
not want to be a jerk anymore.

01:14:26.305 --> 01:14:31.834
Actually, it makes you want to
give everything you got to that one person.

01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:38.673
Yeah. You know, it's true when women say
that all of the good men are

01:14:38.751 --> 01:14:40.912
either gay or married.

01:14:40.987 --> 01:14:44.548
And of course,
I'm hanging out with one who's both.

01:14:44.624 --> 01:14:49.152
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Just for the record, though,

01:14:49.228 --> 01:14:52.686
if I wasn't so
into chubby hubbies

01:14:52.765 --> 01:14:54.824
or chunky monkeys...
What did you say again?

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:55.900
Chubby chaser.

01:14:55.968 --> 01:14:57.367
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:14:58.971 --> 01:15:01.098
I would be just so all over you.

01:15:01.173 --> 01:15:03.835
Oh, come on. No way.

01:15:03.909 --> 01:15:05.706
Are you kidding me?
Look at you.

01:15:05.778 --> 01:15:11.614
You're gorgeous, and you're smart,
you're passionate, funny.

01:15:14.253 --> 01:15:16.312
I'm just so happy I met you.

01:15:16.389 --> 01:15:18.323
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:19.291 --> 01:15:21.953
Friends. Friends forever.

01:15:31.837 --> 01:15:33.202
Oh, yeah.

01:15:40.479 --> 01:15:42.572
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, what are we doing?

01:15:42.648 --> 01:15:46.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
Hey, hey, Alex.

01:15:46.719 --> 01:15:49.688
I just never felt this way
about a woman before.

01:15:49.755 --> 01:15:51.017
Because you're gay.

01:15:51.090 --> 01:15:53.320
And you're married.
And you're my client.

01:15:53.492 --> 01:15:54.516
This is so wrong!

01:15:54.593 --> 01:15:56.754
No, it's not about right or wrong,

01:15:56.829 --> 01:16:00.094
or gay or straight,
or hard or soft. It's...

01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:05.362
Wow.

01:16:05.971 --> 01:16:07.939
No! I can't see you.

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.540
I can't see you.
Except as a client.

01:16:10.609 --> 01:16:12.509
Alex, don't say that. Please?

01:16:12.578 --> 01:16:15.638
I believe in marriage.
I believe in what it represents.

01:16:15.715 --> 01:16:20.914
I betrayed you. I betrayed Larry!
Oh, my God, poor Larry!

01:16:20.986 --> 01:16:25.548
Larry, he's a great guy, but I gotta be
honest with you, our marriage is...

01:16:26.325 --> 01:16:30.591
All he does is watch his baseball games,
and, like, I don't even exist anymore!

01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:32.254
You have to go. I'm sorry.

01:16:32.665 --> 01:16:34.223
He hits me, though.

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.565
I'm so sorry.
Please, please, please go.

01:16:46.445 --> 01:16:47.503
Hey!

01:16:48.848 --> 01:16:51.442
What the hell's going on out here?

01:16:52.184 --> 01:16:55.620
Nothing. I'm just draining a few buckets
with Eric and Tori over here,

01:16:55.688 --> 01:16:57.178
making small talk, you know?

01:16:57.356 --> 01:16:58.596
You'd think on such a nice day,

01:16:58.624 --> 01:17:00.785
your husband would want to
spend time with his family.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.226
Where is he, anyway?
Is he out straight-bashing again?

01:17:03.295 --> 01:17:05.496
No, he's at his mother's.
He's taking her to the movies.

01:17:05.531 --> 01:17:08.466
No, Daddy.
He's with that smoking hot lawyer lady

01:17:08.534 --> 01:17:10.934
he always talks about
when you're not around.

01:17:11.003 --> 01:17:12.470
He is?

01:17:14.039 --> 01:17:15.097
Hey!

01:17:16.108 --> 01:17:19.874
I just felt a breeze,
Mr. Valentine,

01:17:19.945 --> 01:17:22.641
and that breeze is blowing
straight towards justice.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.729
Hey, guys, we got a perpetrator
lodged in the air duct.

01:17:37.797 --> 01:17:41.665
Apparently tried to break in last night,
got stuck.

01:17:41.734 --> 01:17:43.133
You're the guys
from the newspaper, right?

01:17:43.202 --> 01:17:45.136
Yeah, that's us. All right, well,
then you're gonna love this.

01:17:45.204 --> 01:17:49.641
The guy got stuck upside-down,
so his ass is still hanging out for you.

01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:51.869
That's pretty funny.
Did your moustache come up with that?

01:17:51.944 --> 01:17:54.572
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't speak Gayanese.

01:17:57.516 --> 01:18:00.349
Hey, anybody!
You gotta get me out of here!

01:18:00.419 --> 01:18:02.512
I just peed on my face!

01:18:02.588 --> 01:18:05.785
All right, relax, buddy,
I'm here to help.

01:18:06.158 --> 01:18:09.719
Unlike some people around here,
who only help themselves.

01:18:09.795 --> 01:18:11.695
- Who are you talking about?
- You.

01:18:11.764 --> 01:18:12.924
Why? What happened?

01:18:12.998 --> 01:18:14.625
Fitzer came by today,
and Tori told him about

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.463
your obsession
with our hot-ass lawyer.

01:18:16.535 --> 01:18:18.901
Obsession? What? What?
What is she talking about?

01:18:18.971 --> 01:18:21.599
Don't even give me that,
Mr. I'm Taking My Mom To A Movie.

01:18:21.674 --> 01:18:23.164
You know what?
Maybe if you were around today,

01:18:23.242 --> 01:18:25.403
Fitzer would actually think that,
I don't know, you like me.

01:18:25.477 --> 01:18:27.570
Hey, man, I gotta lie to you!

01:18:27.646 --> 01:18:29.910
Thanks to you,
I gotta lie to everybody!

01:18:29.982 --> 01:18:33.179
Especially Alex!
I can't be honest with her!

01:18:33.252 --> 01:18:36.052
I can't even get close to her.
I can't even have freaking fun with her!

01:18:36.088 --> 01:18:39.216
Why can't you have fun with me?
We always used to have fun. I just...

01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:40.758
Because you've changed!

01:18:40.826 --> 01:18:43.056
Ever since you forced me
to marry you,

01:18:43.128 --> 01:18:44.493
you're so goddamn controlling.

01:18:44.563 --> 01:18:47.498
You don't act like my freaking husband,
you act like my boss.

01:18:47.566 --> 01:18:50.967
"Don't do this!" "Don't do that!"
"Hey, what time you coming home tonight?"

01:18:51.036 --> 01:18:53.470
You're smothering me, man!
I can't freaking breathe!

01:18:53.539 --> 01:18:55.507
What you guys need
is a bubble bath.

01:18:55.574 --> 01:18:56.700
Shut up!

01:18:56.775 --> 01:19:00.438
Idiot, the only reason you're feeling that way
is because you're afraid of feeling trapped.

01:19:00.512 --> 01:19:02.173
That's what happens
when you get married!

01:19:02.248 --> 01:19:04.944
Fat-ass, we're not
really married!

01:19:05.017 --> 01:19:07.315
I'm just in some gay,
crazy nightmare!

01:19:07.386 --> 01:19:09.911
Yeah, that you can't commit to,
'cause you can't commit to anything!

01:19:09.989 --> 01:19:13.230
I swear to God, I feel like I'm the only
one who's trying to make this thing work!

01:19:13.259 --> 01:19:16.990
Work! That's right, it's become work!
This relationship is work!

01:19:17.062 --> 01:19:19.724
Face it, we are not
supposed to be together.

01:19:19.798 --> 01:19:22.596
I found somebody
I really want to be with.

01:19:22.668 --> 01:19:24.898
Instead of being jealous of that,
why don't you do the same?

01:19:24.970 --> 01:19:26.699
Because I still love my wife.

01:19:26.772 --> 01:19:29.070
Well, move on already.

01:19:29.141 --> 01:19:32.235
Your house is like
a freaking shrine to Paula!

01:19:32.311 --> 01:19:35.178
One of these days
you gotta get a real wife,

01:19:35.247 --> 01:19:37.738
one that your kids don't gotta
lie about every two seconds.

01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:39.909
No, you can't keep it in your pants
for five minutes,

01:19:39.985 --> 01:19:41.612
and that's why we're
so screwed up now!

01:19:41.687 --> 01:19:44.918
Whoa, back up, buddy.
You know why we're in this jam.

01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:46.958
'Cause you can't open
your freaking mail!

01:19:47.026 --> 01:19:49.620
Everything with Paula's name on it
gets tossed in a desk

01:19:49.695 --> 01:19:51.788
and filed under
"Too painful to deal with"!

01:19:51.897 --> 01:19:54.627
Guys, could you at least call
another fire department?

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:57.362
What is your rush, idiot?
You're going straight to jail anyway.

01:19:57.436 --> 01:20:00.371
You know what? I cannot deal with sleeping
next to your stupid, ugly face tonight.

01:20:00.439 --> 01:20:01.667
So don't bother coming
in the bedroom.

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:03.230
Oh, wouldn't dream of it, honey.

01:20:03.309 --> 01:20:06.870
You are a lousy best friend
and a shitty husband!

01:20:06.946 --> 01:20:10.074
Hey! For the record,
every time I laughed at one of your jokes,

01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:12.117
I was faking it.

01:20:12.217 --> 01:20:13.844
You're a monster!

01:20:19.258 --> 01:20:21.988
Oh, my God,
it's Mr. February!

01:20:22.061 --> 01:20:24.655
I love you, I love you, I love you!

01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:26.061
I love you!

01:20:30.069 --> 01:20:32.264
Wow, that's a gay bracelet.

01:20:33.038 --> 01:20:34.471
I hope Fitzer sees that.

01:20:36.008 --> 01:20:37.339
Shut up.

01:20:47.786 --> 01:20:48.912
You needed to see us?

01:20:48.988 --> 01:20:50.421
Shut the door.

01:20:52.591 --> 01:20:55.151
You know,
for the first time this month,

01:20:55.227 --> 01:20:58.196
I pissed without spraying
in all three urinals at once,

01:20:58.263 --> 01:20:59.730
so I was in a relatively good mood.

01:21:00.265 --> 01:21:01.823
Until I received this.

01:21:04.503 --> 01:21:06.300
Seems the guys in the company
took a meeting.

01:21:06.372 --> 01:21:09.808
They all signed that petition requesting
that I transfer you both out of here.

01:21:09.875 --> 01:21:11.570
- What?
- And you're gonna listen to these idiots?

01:21:11.643 --> 01:21:13.372
I'm not gonna do it,
but I have to do something

01:21:13.445 --> 01:21:14.707
to keep the peace.

01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:16.475
Now, personally,
I think it's just a matter of time

01:21:16.548 --> 01:21:19.346
before your little act gets busted.
Until then, you're on separate shifts.

01:21:19.418 --> 01:21:20.442
- What?
- Separate shifts?

01:21:20.519 --> 01:21:22.111
Hey, we've been together forever!

01:21:22.187 --> 01:21:24.519
So were my balls,
and now I only have one of them.

01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:25.648
What?

01:21:25.724 --> 01:21:28.215
Valentine, go to work.
Levine, go home.

01:21:36.235 --> 01:21:37.862
Hey, fellas!

01:21:38.137 --> 01:21:42.631
Hey. Heard you guys have been
circulating a petition.

01:21:43.942 --> 01:21:47.139
You mind if I take a look at it?

01:21:47.713 --> 01:21:50.580
Oh, what do you know?
I got it right here.

01:21:51.083 --> 01:21:53.244
It's impressive.
Lot of names.

01:21:53.452 --> 01:21:55.545
Let's go down the list,
see who we got here.

01:21:56.555 --> 01:22:01.117
Nootzie! Hey, you remember that time
Chuck and I ran back in that textile plant

01:22:01.393 --> 01:22:03.418
and dragged your limp body out?

01:22:03.495 --> 01:22:06.953
Even though Chuck's leg was broken,
like, in three different places?

01:22:07.032 --> 01:22:10.024
I mean, that was pretty
freaking gay of Chuck, huh?

01:22:10.102 --> 01:22:13.003
Wow. Renaldo!

01:22:13.505 --> 01:22:15.769
Man, I remember your first day
on the job.

01:22:15.841 --> 01:22:19.174
Remember you were so scared
you actually crapped yourself?

01:22:19.244 --> 01:22:20.973
And Chuck and I,
we snuck you back in here,

01:22:21.046 --> 01:22:22.877
we cleaned you up
so nobody'd find out.

01:22:22.948 --> 01:22:24.745
You begged us not to tell anyone,
and did we?

01:22:24.883 --> 01:22:25.883
Let's ask.

01:22:26.618 --> 01:22:29.485
You guys hear that story before right now?
Show of hands?

01:22:29.555 --> 01:22:31.352
No, but it's hilarious.

01:22:31.423 --> 01:22:33.482
Yeah, it is hilarious.

01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:38.052
Tony! Nice signature.

01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:40.860
Hey, is that the same one you used
to endorse the check that Chuck gave you

01:22:40.933 --> 01:22:43.959
when you gambled away
your mortgage payment on college football?

01:22:44.036 --> 01:22:46.334
I guess his money wasn't
too gay to bail you out

01:22:46.405 --> 01:22:48.532
or keep your wife
from leaving you again.

01:22:48.607 --> 01:22:49.904
Again?

01:22:50.742 --> 01:22:52.403
I guess Chuck's
not enough of a man

01:22:52.478 --> 01:22:54.878
to work next to big strong heroes
like you guys.

01:22:56.014 --> 01:22:58.005
Oh, look at that. Fire.

01:22:58.083 --> 01:22:59.607
Well, I hope it's not a bad one,

01:22:59.685 --> 01:23:01.585
'cause the faggot who's been
saving your sorry asses

01:23:01.653 --> 01:23:04.645
is now, thanks to you,
working on another shift. Let's go!

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.090
"That's when Sadie said",

01:23:10.162 --> 01:23:13.256
"Love will always help you
find your way home."

01:23:14.533 --> 01:23:17.263
Sleeping. Sleeping.

01:23:20.506 --> 01:23:22.030
That was easy.

01:23:57.576 --> 01:23:59.703
Paula, you know I love you.

01:24:02.047 --> 01:24:03.412
I gotta.

01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:24.193
Hey.

01:24:26.004 --> 01:24:27.301
I'm sorry.

01:24:28.674 --> 01:24:30.039
Me, too.

01:24:30.809 --> 01:24:31.833
That stuff I said...

01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:33.172
I know.

01:24:35.781 --> 01:24:38.045
Can I sleep in the bed tonight?

01:24:40.185 --> 01:24:41.709
I'd like that.

01:24:43.021 --> 01:24:44.454
All right.

01:24:46.458 --> 01:24:48.255
- Come here.
- Yeah.

01:24:57.569 --> 01:24:59.196
Handle with care.

01:25:00.572 --> 01:25:02.133
Larry...

01:25:03.542 --> 01:25:08.172
Don't let him sleep
on top of me again, Larry.

01:25:08.247 --> 01:25:10.408
Don't do the voice.
I will kill you, I swear.

01:25:10.482 --> 01:25:11.608
Okay, then.

01:25:11.683 --> 01:25:13.207
Hey! Hey, hey!

01:25:13.285 --> 01:25:15.185
You ready for your big day,
little man?

01:25:15.254 --> 01:25:16.312
Big day?

01:25:16.388 --> 01:25:19.824
My audition, Dad. Me and Uncle Chuck
have been practicing for weeks.

01:25:19.891 --> 01:25:23.190
He wanted to work with you,
but I was around, so...

01:25:23.262 --> 01:25:27.323
Why don't you do one last rehearsal,
let your father play the Annie role?

01:25:27.399 --> 01:25:29.594
Fabulicious!
I'll get my music!

01:25:29.668 --> 01:25:31.499
Did you hear that?
It's fabulicious!

01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:33.299
- Hey, come on, come on.
- Okay.

01:25:33.472 --> 01:25:36.771

There's my star!

01:25:53.325 --> 01:25:57.625
Turn it around, and a flip, flip, flip,
flippety-flip and a skip.

01:25:58.130 --> 01:25:59.529
Double-time!

01:26:05.237 --> 01:26:06.499
And a Russian split!

01:26:06.672 --> 01:26:08.902
Oh, you nailed it!

01:26:08.974 --> 01:26:10.407
My kid is pretty awesome.

01:26:10.475 --> 01:26:12.534
There's only one guy I know
who can dance better than that.

01:26:12.611 --> 01:26:14.704
- Who?
- The homeless guy from our wedding.

01:26:16.081 --> 01:26:18.572
That dude was
pretty good. Yeah!

01:26:21.586 --> 01:26:23.247
Balls and wieners.

01:26:23.322 --> 01:26:24.346
<i>Is it true?</i>

01:26:24.556 --> 01:26:25.750
Alex?

01:26:28.527 --> 01:26:29.653
Look at this.

01:26:29.861 --> 01:26:33.160
Sixteen depositions from women
who claim to have slept with you

01:26:33.231 --> 01:26:34.664
over the last year and a half.

01:26:34.733 --> 01:26:36.166
Just 16?

01:26:36.234 --> 01:26:38.293
Thank God the 500 other ones
couldn't read or write.

01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:41.635
Wait a minute.
You knew about him and all these women?

01:26:41.707 --> 01:26:44.437
Alex, know what it is?
We've been through this before.

01:26:44.509 --> 01:26:45.669
Chuck's...

01:26:45.844 --> 01:26:48.244
He's got a bit of a problem.

01:26:48.313 --> 01:26:51.373
He messes around
with women because

01:26:52.551 --> 01:26:54.985
he's ashamed of being gay.

01:26:55.053 --> 01:26:57.453
Now, is it all just about you,

01:26:57.556 --> 01:27:00.320
or do you really just don't consider
anybody else's feelings?

01:27:00.392 --> 01:27:02.986
No, I don't.
I'm just a big gay jerk.

01:27:06.264 --> 01:27:08.105
- What are you doing?
- You know you like that.

01:27:08.133 --> 01:27:10.829
Guys, guys, the shit is
about to hit the fan, okay?

01:27:10.902 --> 01:27:12.130
And if I'm gonna defend you,

01:27:12.204 --> 01:27:14.365
I have to know the truth.

01:27:14.439 --> 01:27:18.205
You have to look me in the eyes
and tell me that you are gay

01:27:18.276 --> 01:27:19.743
and that this marriage
is legitimate.

01:27:19.811 --> 01:27:22.678
Alex, we're gay, okay?

01:27:22.748 --> 01:27:25.080
And we are married.

01:27:29.187 --> 01:27:30.745
It's real.

01:27:32.824 --> 01:27:34.348
Can you help us out?

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:36.259
Okay.

01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:40.291
Okay. This investigation is
gonna get rough.

01:27:40.465 --> 01:27:43.161
They are gonna quiz you
about every detail of your lives,

01:27:43.235 --> 01:27:45.601
every aspect
of your relationship.

01:27:45.670 --> 01:27:50.107
But since you guys are telling the truth,
then I'm sure you'll be fine.

01:27:51.743 --> 01:27:54.974
Just for the record, I thought
this was a man when I was with her.

01:27:55.046 --> 01:27:56.911
Does that help us out at all?

01:28:04.689 --> 01:28:07.157
Let's go over it again.
Your birthday?

01:28:07.225 --> 01:28:09.284
April 26th. Taurus.

01:28:09.361 --> 01:28:10.487
Got it.

01:28:10.562 --> 01:28:11.654
Yours?

01:28:11.730 --> 01:28:12.890
September 9th. Virgo.

01:28:13.732 --> 01:28:15.461
How about
your favorite brand of underwear?

01:28:15.534 --> 01:28:17.399
That would be
Mr. Calvin Klein.

01:28:17.469 --> 01:28:19.835
I can tell you
my least favorite.

01:28:19.905 --> 01:28:20.997
Whoa!

01:28:47.499 --> 01:28:49.399
I love you, Mr. February!

01:28:49.868 --> 01:28:52.564
You're going down!
You're an abomination! Homo!

01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:58.532
I'm on fire! Help me!

01:28:58.610 --> 01:29:00.339
We're all with you, Larry!

01:29:00.412 --> 01:29:02.607
<i>Fear the queer!</i>

01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:14.588
Thou shalt not lie with men!

01:29:14.659 --> 01:29:16.957
All right, Mr. February,

01:29:17.028 --> 01:29:19.758
let's go show these guys
how married we are.

01:29:19.831 --> 01:29:21.389
What the heck?

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:36.370
What are you guys doing here?

01:29:36.448 --> 01:29:40.714
We're here to apologize and back you up,
like you always did for us.

01:29:40.785 --> 01:29:44.448
Yeah, we all lost a lot of friends on
this job that we will never get back.

01:29:44.523 --> 01:29:47.458
We don't want to lose two more
because we were being thickheaded.

01:29:47.526 --> 01:29:49.790
Yeah. We're partners for life.

01:29:50.228 --> 01:29:52.196
Not partners like youse two,

01:29:52.264 --> 01:29:54.255
but you know what I mean.

01:29:54.332 --> 01:29:55.458
Yeah.

01:29:56.468 --> 01:29:57.867
I love youse guys.

01:29:57.936 --> 01:29:59.267
That's all right, man.

01:29:59.337 --> 01:30:02.238
Molest him! No, I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding you, Nootz. I'm kidding.

01:30:06.177 --> 01:30:07.906
- Hey, Chuckie.
- Yeah?

01:30:08.046 --> 01:30:10.412
- I gotta ask you something. I mean...
- What's up?

01:30:10.482 --> 01:30:11.915
...why'd you pick Larry?

01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:16.052
I mean, I work out,
I tweeze my unibrow.

01:30:16.555 --> 01:30:18.853
Am I not good-looking enough for you
or some shit?

01:30:18.924 --> 01:30:21.119
No, no, no.
Renaldo, you're just not my type.

01:30:21.192 --> 01:30:22.523
You're a 10.

01:30:22.861 --> 01:30:26.058
I just like them chubby.
That's my thing.

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:29.762
I'm a 10!

01:30:30.035 --> 01:30:33.027
You hear that? I'm a 10!

01:30:33.104 --> 01:30:34.799
On a scale to 100.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.539
You're just jealous
'cause gay guys like me.

01:30:40.245 --> 01:30:43.544
Good morning, everyone.
I'm Daniel Banks, City Council President,

01:30:43.615 --> 01:30:46.607
and I'll be presiding
over these proceedings.

01:30:46.685 --> 01:30:50.018
It's going to be a long day,
so let's dispense with the preliminaries

01:30:50.088 --> 01:30:53.819
and just get started. Mr. Fitzer.

01:30:58.730 --> 01:31:00.857
Thank you, Your Councilship.

01:31:07.539 --> 01:31:09.063
It's for later.

01:31:10.508 --> 01:31:14.410
Mr. Valentine,
please tell us why you married Mr. Levine.

01:31:17.716 --> 01:31:18.808
Love.

01:31:18.883 --> 01:31:21.181
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about!
Gay love!

01:31:21.252 --> 01:31:22.412
Please sit down, sir.

01:31:22.487 --> 01:31:23.852
Sorry.

01:31:26.057 --> 01:31:28.048
- Mr. Levine.
- Yeah.

01:31:28.827 --> 01:31:31.955
Sixteen local women
claim to have had

01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:36.194
sexual relations with you
as recently as mid-April,

01:31:36.267 --> 01:31:42.172
including four Canadian strippers
the morning of your "marriage."

01:31:44.476 --> 01:31:49.175
That's true. I did have
sexual relationships with them girls,

01:31:50.515 --> 01:31:54.349
but I was kind of having
a commitment issue.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.111
Larry's forgiven me for that.

01:31:57.689 --> 01:31:59.850
And that's all that counts to me
is what Larry thinks.

01:31:59.924 --> 01:32:01.687
That's right, Fitzer,
you suck!

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.921
One more and you're out, sir.

01:32:03.995 --> 01:32:07.192
Sorry, sir, you're cool. He sucks.
I'm gay. I'm out. All right.

01:32:07.265 --> 01:32:09.699
We should question them ex parte.

01:32:09.768 --> 01:32:11.167
Gentlemen.
Yeah?

01:32:11.236 --> 01:32:14.330
At this time,
we'd like to interview you individually.

01:32:14.406 --> 01:32:16.431
Mr. Levine, please step outside.

01:32:18.343 --> 01:32:19.970
Yeah. No problem.

01:32:23.682 --> 01:32:24.910
I'll miss you.

01:32:24.983 --> 01:32:26.211
I'll miss you, too, buddy.

01:32:27.185 --> 01:32:28.413
I like it rough!

01:32:28.486 --> 01:32:29.976
One for the road.

01:32:30.055 --> 01:32:31.818
Like it rough.

01:32:32.757 --> 01:32:35.123
I did the cooking
until Chuck moved in.

01:32:35.894 --> 01:32:37.225
The toilet was thankful.

01:32:37.328 --> 01:32:41.662
He ain't the greatest chef in the world.
I'm Wolfgang Puck to his Wolfgang Suck.

01:32:41.733 --> 01:32:45.032
We met back in the
fire academy in 1987.

01:32:45.103 --> 01:32:46.798
I was top of our class.

01:32:46.871 --> 01:32:49.533
He burned off his
eyebrows first day. Gone.

01:32:49.607 --> 01:32:52.701
Larry tried to eat the fire,
I remember that.

01:32:52.777 --> 01:32:56.178
<i>His favorite song,
Don't Fear the Reaper, Blue Oyster Cult.</i>

01:32:56.247 --> 01:32:59.944
<i>You're Beautiful by James Blunt.
And people think I'm the woman.</i>

01:33:00.018 --> 01:33:01.815
<i>♪ You're beautiful. ♪</i>

01:33:01.886 --> 01:33:04.377
Just gets me every time.
I don't know.

01:33:04.456 --> 01:33:06.253
<i>♪ You're beautiful. ♪</i>

01:33:07.192 --> 01:33:08.955
That is a nice song.

01:33:09.928 --> 01:33:13.420
The thing he likes most about me
is probably my love handles.

01:33:13.998 --> 01:33:15.260
All of them.

01:33:15.333 --> 01:33:19.702
I'd say my sweet, sensitive eyes,
like that of a kitten.

01:33:21.973 --> 01:33:23.964
The worst day
we ever had on the job?

01:33:24.042 --> 01:33:27.205
This little kid fell
in a swimming pool.

01:33:27.445 --> 01:33:29.345
Chuck was the first one there.

01:33:29.414 --> 01:33:30.574
I dove in.

01:33:30.749 --> 01:33:31.773
He pulled him out.

01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:32.850
I worked on him.

01:33:32.917 --> 01:33:36.045
Worked on him,
worked on him, but...

01:33:36.421 --> 01:33:38.753
And Larry stayed with me
all that night.

01:33:39.691 --> 01:33:42.558
I just couldn't get that kid
out of my head.

01:33:45.897 --> 01:33:47.797
When my wife died...

01:33:47.866 --> 01:33:49.595
That was the worst.

01:33:50.802 --> 01:33:52.030
...I collapsed.

01:33:52.103 --> 01:33:53.661
He knew it was coming, but...

01:33:53.738 --> 01:33:56.639
What we have,
it's beyond friendship.

01:33:57.375 --> 01:33:59.502
He's the best man I know.

01:33:59.577 --> 01:34:01.636
I'd do anything for him.

01:34:02.046 --> 01:34:03.206
I love him.

01:34:03.915 --> 01:34:05.405
I love him.

01:34:08.453 --> 01:34:09.920
What's going on?
How'd you do?

01:34:09.988 --> 01:34:11.546
It was good.
It was no problem.

01:34:11.623 --> 01:34:13.557
You want me to grab those?
See if they're real again?

01:34:13.625 --> 01:34:14.625
I'm sorry?

01:34:14.692 --> 01:34:16.057
I says are we done yet?

01:34:16.361 --> 01:34:19.091
Not quite.
They want to talk to the kids.

01:34:19.964 --> 01:34:23.730
Now, why don't you tell us
about their sleeping arrangements?

01:34:23.802 --> 01:34:25.929
Dad and Uncle Chuck
sleep in the same bed.

01:34:26.004 --> 01:34:27.369
Do you know why?

01:34:27.438 --> 01:34:29.338
'Cause they do
everything together.

01:34:29.407 --> 01:34:31.398
Just like Will and Grace.

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:39.177
It is kind of an unusual
situation, isn't it?

01:34:39.984 --> 01:34:41.349
Having two fathers?

01:34:41.886 --> 01:34:43.820
I don't have two fathers.

01:34:46.257 --> 01:34:47.519
I have my daddy,

01:34:47.592 --> 01:34:51.084
and Uncle Chuck is more like a mommy,
'cause to me he seems like a girl.

01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:55.221
Why am I the woman?
I don't get it.

01:34:55.934 --> 01:34:57.060
Okay, that's all, thank you.

01:34:57.135 --> 01:34:58.830
Bottlenose dolphins.

01:34:59.370 --> 01:35:03.363
Orcas, gray whales, harbor seals
and West Indian manatees.

01:35:03.508 --> 01:35:04.508
Huh?

01:35:04.809 --> 01:35:07.539
Species that sometimes mate
with the same sex.

01:35:07.712 --> 01:35:12.740
Bottlenose dolphins, orcas, gray whales,
harbor seals and West Indian manatees.

01:35:13.351 --> 01:35:16.343
I didn't know that.
But now I'm glad I do.

01:35:16.454 --> 01:35:18.149
Thank you, my dear.

01:35:21.492 --> 01:35:25.553
Remind me never to go skinny-dipping
with the bottlenose dolphins.

01:35:29.234 --> 01:35:34.297
I just have to say
that as a fellow gay fireman...

01:35:35.106 --> 01:35:36.232
He's gay, too?

01:35:36.307 --> 01:35:37.934
That's right, fellas, I'm gay.

01:35:38.476 --> 01:35:40.501
You guys have
a problem with that?

01:35:40.578 --> 01:35:43.672
No, no problem.
You do whatever you like. Yeah.

01:35:45.116 --> 01:35:46.549
And Chuck and Larry,

01:35:47.318 --> 01:35:50.048
you've inspired me
to want to find my soul mate.

01:35:51.522 --> 01:35:53.012
Wherever he may be.

01:35:53.458 --> 01:35:55.790
Hey, I'm a 10. I'm a 10.

01:35:56.027 --> 01:35:58.052
You're not my type. Sorry.

01:35:59.063 --> 01:36:01.224
Fitzer, can we wrap this up?

01:36:01.432 --> 01:36:04.993
I just have one more
question to ask,

01:36:05.069 --> 01:36:07.537
if these gentlemen would
indulge me for a moment.

01:36:07.605 --> 01:36:09.539
By all means, Mr. Fitzer.

01:36:10.341 --> 01:36:12.104
Chuck, Larry,

01:36:12.644 --> 01:36:17.240
would you say that there's a fair amount
of passion in your relationship?

01:36:17.882 --> 01:36:19.008
Absolutely.

01:36:19.083 --> 01:36:20.684
More passion than you
can imagine, buddy.

01:36:20.685 --> 01:36:22.175
- Yes.
- How wonderful.

01:36:22.687 --> 01:36:26.145
Now, if you'd be so kind,
I'd like you to kiss each other.

01:36:26.224 --> 01:36:27.919
You'd like to...
What was that?

01:36:27.992 --> 01:36:31.018
Councilman Banks, my clients have been
more than accommodating.

01:36:31.095 --> 01:36:33.825
And to ask for a display of intimacy
in the middle of a crowded room

01:36:33.898 --> 01:36:35.229
is simply demeaning.

01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:37.962
I'm afraid I have to agree.
We seem to have gone

01:36:38.036 --> 01:36:42.029
from a hearing about fraud
to some kind of weird gay witch hunt.

01:36:43.141 --> 01:36:45.507
I'm just saying,
Your Exellegance,

01:36:45.576 --> 01:36:48.511
that if these two men are
as in love as they say they are,

01:36:48.579 --> 01:36:50.570
I don't see why
this should be a problem.

01:36:50.648 --> 01:36:53.048
I'm just asking for
one kiss, Councilman.

01:36:53.117 --> 01:36:56.416
Yeah! Come on, fellas,
show them how real men kiss! Come on!

01:36:56.487 --> 01:37:00.583
I will not stand for it! This is
unbelievable! No. Absolutely not.

01:37:00.658 --> 01:37:02.922
Hey, come on, no.
The Councilman agreed.

01:37:02.994 --> 01:37:04.427
It's demeaning to us.

01:37:04.495 --> 01:37:08.454
Plus, we don't want to get you all horny.
Me and this guy, we... It could get steamy.

01:37:08.533 --> 01:37:13.402
Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

01:37:13.471 --> 01:37:14.768
Order.

01:37:15.673 --> 01:37:16.901
Order!

01:37:17.942 --> 01:37:19.462
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:21.034
I'm not doing this, Alex.

01:37:21.112 --> 01:37:23.046
You know what?
Just go for it.

01:37:23.982 --> 01:37:25.381
- Well?
- Order!

01:37:27.485 --> 01:37:29.385
I guess it's showtime.

01:37:30.855 --> 01:37:32.550
Going in straight...

01:37:32.623 --> 01:37:34.614
Coming out gay?

01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:08.855
Enough! I'd rather change
my grandfather's diaper

01:38:08.926 --> 01:38:10.393
than see two straight
guys kissing.

01:38:10.461 --> 01:38:11.951
But we're not straight.

01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:13.510
We're not.
We're in gay love, Captain!

01:38:13.564 --> 01:38:15.998
- Can't you deal with that?
- Oh, shut up.

01:38:16.067 --> 01:38:18.763
If these gentlemen are gay,
then I'm a one-legged parrot.

01:38:18.836 --> 01:38:21.134
Anybody seen me
with a crutch and a cracker?

01:38:21.606 --> 01:38:22.606
I didn't think so.

01:38:23.007 --> 01:38:24.736
And who might you be, sir?

01:38:24.809 --> 01:38:26.777
Captain Phineas J. Tucker,
Councilman.

01:38:26.844 --> 01:38:29.972
You may search my record.
I hold multiple citations

01:38:30.048 --> 01:38:33.575
from Mayor Dinkins, Mayor Koch and,
of course, the great Mayor Giuliani.

01:38:33.651 --> 01:38:37.052
And let me tell you something.
These men definitely broke the rules.

01:38:37.121 --> 01:38:39.817
They lied on a government form
and they swore it was true,

01:38:39.891 --> 01:38:41.654
which is despicable.

01:38:41.926 --> 01:38:45.760
But interestingly
enough, Excellency,

01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:48.025
even though they were
deceitful to us all,

01:38:48.099 --> 01:38:50.693
I actually believe
they ended up doing some good.

01:38:50.768 --> 01:38:52.633
What good are you
speaking of, Captain?

01:38:52.703 --> 01:38:54.398
Well, first off,

01:38:54.472 --> 01:38:56.997
they let us know
that when a friend is in need,

01:38:57.075 --> 01:38:59.942
you go beyond extraordinary
lengths to help out.

01:39:00.011 --> 01:39:02.445
Whenever, whatever.
That's the code.

01:39:02.513 --> 01:39:05.209
Then they apparently inspired
fellow firefighter Fred G. Duncan

01:39:05.283 --> 01:39:07.808
to come out of his super-sized closet,

01:39:07.885 --> 01:39:09.648
thus releasing his rage

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:13.315
and preventing what looked like to be
an inevitable killing spree.

01:39:16.694 --> 01:39:18.559
And most importantly,

01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:21.496
they showed us
that no matter whom we choose to love,

01:39:21.566 --> 01:39:26.196
be they heterosexual, homosexual, asexual,
bisexual, trisexual, quadrisexual,

01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:28.500
pansexual, transsexual, omnisexual,

01:39:28.573 --> 01:39:33.476
or that thing where the chick ties the belt
around your neck and tinkles on a balloon,

01:39:35.113 --> 01:39:39.345
it has absolutely nothing to do
with who we are as people.

01:39:53.531 --> 01:39:56.227
It's true, Councilman Banks.

01:39:59.003 --> 01:40:00.402
Let them know.

01:40:00.471 --> 01:40:01.938
We're not gay.

01:40:03.608 --> 01:40:04.632
No.

01:40:05.610 --> 01:40:08.738
Unfortunately, we hurt people,

01:40:08.813 --> 01:40:13.273
people we wouldn't want to hurt
in a million years, by doing what we did.

01:40:14.652 --> 01:40:18.611
For the record,
the word "faggot," that's a bad word.

01:40:18.689 --> 01:40:21.590
Don't use it.
I used to say it more than anybody,

01:40:21.659 --> 01:40:23.650
but I was ignorant.
It's hurtful.

01:40:23.895 --> 01:40:26.921
It's like "kike" for me.

01:40:27.431 --> 01:40:29.296
Or "fat boy" for me.

01:40:31.369 --> 01:40:33.030
It stings a little
when you poke fun of my weight.

01:40:33.104 --> 01:40:34.594
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, sometimes it...

01:40:34.672 --> 01:40:36.572
- I only do it 'cause you do it.
- I know, but I work hard...

01:40:36.641 --> 01:40:39.701
<i>What is this?
Gays of Our Lives?</i>

01:40:40.244 --> 01:40:42.269
Shall we cue the violins?

01:40:43.047 --> 01:40:45.174
This isn't a folk concert,
it's a hearing.

01:40:45.249 --> 01:40:50.516
And I believe I hear the sound
of two felons going to jail

01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:53.851
for stealing from the
City of New York.

01:40:53.925 --> 01:40:56.951
What exactly have we stolen?
Nothing!

01:40:57.962 --> 01:41:00.760
Due to a weird rule
in a flawed system,

01:41:00.831 --> 01:41:03.698
my friend Larry here had
to create this lie.

01:41:03.768 --> 01:41:06.635
The system may be flawed at times,
Mr. Feb-blueberry.

01:41:06.704 --> 01:41:08.171
"I'm in a calendar!"

01:41:09.907 --> 01:41:13.138
But it's the law.
And we all have to abide by it.

01:41:16.781 --> 01:41:19.272
I'm sorry,
but you did break the law.

01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:20.408
Oh, God.

01:41:20.484 --> 01:41:21.712
Daddy!

01:41:22.954 --> 01:41:24.979
Councilman Banks. Councilman.

01:41:26.157 --> 01:41:28.091
Well, you better
have cuffs for three,

01:41:28.626 --> 01:41:30.423
because I'm going
to jail with them.

01:41:30.494 --> 01:41:31.984
How is that, Captain?

01:41:32.063 --> 01:41:34.759
I'm a co-conspirator.
I knew all about this little scam

01:41:34.832 --> 01:41:36.857
from day one,
and I didn't say a thing about it.

01:41:36.934 --> 01:41:38.458
- Captain!
- You don't have to do this. Please.

01:41:38.536 --> 01:41:39.560
Yeah, he didn't know nothing.

01:41:39.637 --> 01:41:41.628
Fine. I'll have all
three of you arrested.

01:41:43.841 --> 01:41:48.244
Slap some cuffs on me,
'cause I helped them plan the wedding.

01:41:48.312 --> 01:41:49.836
I drove them to the airport.

01:41:49.914 --> 01:41:51.381
I picked out Chuck's dress.

01:41:51.449 --> 01:41:52.473
Yeah, I knew about it.

01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:55.110
Dress? Why does everybody
assume I'm the woman?

01:41:55.186 --> 01:41:57.245
Is it the way I walk?
What is it?

01:41:57.321 --> 01:42:00.518
And I caught the bouquet!
In my mouth. I liked it.

01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:04.724
See, that's the way it works
with us firemen, sir.

01:42:04.795 --> 01:42:07.355
You throw one of us in the fire,
we all go rushing in.

01:42:08.566 --> 01:42:12.696
You throw one of us in jail, you gotta
throw the whole lot of us in jail.

01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:15.330
So? What's it gonna be?

01:42:18.376 --> 01:42:20.571
Everything would have been fine
if you'd just let

01:42:20.645 --> 01:42:22.306
me and Larry make out
like we were gonna.

01:42:22.413 --> 01:42:24.404
Then you had to go
all Knute Rockne on us.

01:42:24.482 --> 01:42:27.349
I am your commanding officer.
I will not be addressed in that manner.

01:42:27.418 --> 01:42:29.579
Not in here you're not,
you porcupine-head.

01:42:29.654 --> 01:42:31.774
No, in here you're the big mouth
who got us locked up.

01:42:31.822 --> 01:42:33.221
We should whup your ass!

01:42:33.291 --> 01:42:34.519
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:42:35.793 --> 01:42:37.055
That's right.

01:42:37.128 --> 01:42:38.254
Hey, Chuck.

01:42:38.329 --> 01:42:40.160
Jeez, Larry. What?

01:42:40.231 --> 01:42:44.998
Free Chuck and Larry!
Free Chuck and Larry!

01:42:45.703 --> 01:42:46.863
What?

01:42:46.937 --> 01:42:49.269
Yo, dum-dums!
You got a visitor.

01:42:52.843 --> 01:42:55.778
Well, gentlemen,
that was quite a hearing.

01:42:55.846 --> 01:42:56.972
Mr. Levine, Mr. Valentine.

01:42:57.048 --> 01:42:58.538
All right.

01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:01.878
The city would like
to offer you a deal.

01:43:01.952 --> 01:43:04.944
We're willing to drop all charges
and allow you to keep your benefits,

01:43:05.022 --> 01:43:06.489
with two conditions.

01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:10.048
One, you plead guilty
to falsifying a government form.

01:43:10.261 --> 01:43:13.025
The charge is reduced to a misdemeanor,
you get a slap on the wrist,

01:43:13.097 --> 01:43:14.860
and the city saves face.

01:43:14.932 --> 01:43:16.160
- Done.
- Done. Absolutely.

01:43:16.233 --> 01:43:19.430
Two, you are celebrities
in the gay community now.

01:43:19.904 --> 01:43:22.270
They've obviously
not only accepted your apology,

01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:24.774
they think you're heroes.

01:43:24.842 --> 01:43:28.938
Now, raising money
for AIDS research is still very crucial,

01:43:29.547 --> 01:43:33.074
and the community has
figured out a way for you all to help.

01:43:33.150 --> 01:43:34.344
- Whatever it takes.
- Yeah.

01:43:34.418 --> 01:43:35.979
- What do you need us to do?
- We're in.

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:19.425
These two guys right here talking
about doing something pretty serious.

01:44:19.497 --> 01:44:23.627
Making a commitment
to love each other forever.

01:44:23.701 --> 01:44:27.967
Now before, they were on the down-low,
living a life that was a lie.

01:44:29.373 --> 01:44:32.706
Now, in a lie,
it's like a circle.

01:44:33.744 --> 01:44:35.109
It never ends.

01:44:35.646 --> 01:44:38.547
You know?
It's not like a rectangle.

01:44:38.616 --> 01:44:41.210
'Cause that has a bunch of,
you know, places that stop.

01:44:41.285 --> 01:44:42.485
This one is a big circle of...

01:44:42.553 --> 01:44:44.316
Okay, you know, wrap up the circle thing.
Come on.

01:44:44.388 --> 01:44:45.719
Moving on.

01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:47.052
I'm gonna move quicker now.

01:44:48.793 --> 01:44:51.421
Do you, Kevin
"Butterfly" McDonough,

01:44:51.495 --> 01:44:56.364
take Fred G. Duncan to be
your lawful wedded partner?

01:44:57.334 --> 01:44:58.562
I dizoo.

01:44:59.537 --> 01:45:01.732
And do you, Fred G. Duncan,

01:45:01.806 --> 01:45:05.469
take this guy over here
to be your lawfully wedded partner?

01:45:05.543 --> 01:45:06.805
I do.

01:45:06.877 --> 01:45:08.469
Well, then, by the
power vested in me

01:45:08.546 --> 01:45:11.310
by the Commonwealth of Canada
and the Province of Ontario,

01:45:11.382 --> 01:45:15.318
which has always been very pro-gay,
unlike that uptight country to the south,

01:45:15.386 --> 01:45:19.652
it's my pleasure to now pronounce
you husband and husband, partners for life.

01:45:53.557 --> 01:45:55.787
There's my lawyer.

01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:57.725
You don't wanna dance, do you?

01:45:58.162 --> 01:46:00.221
I don't think so.

01:46:00.831 --> 01:46:03.322
Your brother forgave me.
Now, why can't you?

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.303
Well, my brother wasn't the one
that you felt up under false pretenses.

01:46:08.372 --> 01:46:11.172
You mean you only let me touch your boobs
'cause you thought I was gay?

01:46:11.342 --> 01:46:12.342
That's sexist.

01:46:12.476 --> 01:46:16.139
I could bring that to the courtroom.
You could be my lawyer.

01:46:18.682 --> 01:46:20.240
Look at Larry, though.

01:46:20.885 --> 01:46:23.115
Looks like he took my advice
and moved on.

01:46:23.187 --> 01:46:27.248
Which is great for him, but I don't
have anybody to hang out with anymore.

01:46:27.324 --> 01:46:31.727
I mean, these bracelets here...
It says, "Friends forever."

01:46:33.998 --> 01:46:37.900
I haven't taken this thing off
since we made them that day. You?

01:46:40.237 --> 01:46:42.364
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:46:57.154 --> 01:47:00.555
Well, you've got about 30 seconds
before I come to my senses.

01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:04.525
- Really?
- Yes.

01:47:04.595 --> 01:47:07.860
And this is my jam, too.
Come on.

01:47:08.699 --> 01:47:10.826
What a delicious-looking cake!

01:47:11.001 --> 01:47:14.300
Oh, maybe Tori
would like to try it.

01:47:14.371 --> 01:47:16.839
That's nice. You gay, her father.
It's nice.

01:47:16.907 --> 01:47:19.432
No, I'm not gay.
This is Larry's daughter, Tori.

01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:21.842
Oh, it's okay, man.
You can come out of the down-low.

01:47:21.912 --> 01:47:23.709
I don't have to come out!
I'm married.

01:47:23.781 --> 01:47:25.501
Which one's your husband?
You point him out.

01:47:25.549 --> 01:47:27.107
No, no! The lady in there.

01:47:27.184 --> 01:47:28.344
Which guy?

01:47:28.419 --> 01:47:29.511
No, no guy. No.

01:47:29.587 --> 01:47:32.420
Hey, you know when you lie,
it's like a circle.

01:47:32.489 --> 01:47:33.513
I'm not lying!
