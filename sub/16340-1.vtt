Hi. You've reached Meryl Morgan.
I can't take your call right now,

00:54.471 --> 00:58.034
so leave a message
and have a great day. Thanks.

00:59.267 --> 01:02.784
Hello. It is me, your husband.

01:03.646 --> 01:08.961
At least, legally still your husband,
as recognized by the state of New York.

01:09.152 --> 01:13.030
And, in the end,
who are we to argue with the Governor?

01:13.031 --> 01:15.657
I wanted to call and just say hello,

01:15.658 --> 01:18.994
as it is approaching the three-month
anniversary of our being separated,

01:18.995 --> 01:20.954
and I thought, perhaps it might be nice
to get together,

01:20.955 --> 01:24.875
as, you know, occasions like this
only come around once in a lifetime.

01:24.876 --> 01:30.130
And... uh, oh, yes! And I saw the cover
of New York Magazine's real estate issue,

01:30.131 --> 01:34.490
and there you were.
And you looked lovely, frankly.

01:34.886 --> 01:38.653
You are staring out from every newsstand
and bus and taxi.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.308
And it is...

01:41.309 --> 01:44.186
"It is genuinely incredible
how you have built your business

01:44.187 --> 01:46.688
"into the premier boutique
real estate firm in the city".

01:46.689 --> 01:49.358
I'm quoting here from the article.
I have five copies.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.751
This way, if we ever get back together
and lose yours, we're covered.

01:56.449 --> 01:59.284
Hi. You've reached Meryl Morgan.
I can't take your call right now,

01:59.285 --> 02:02.802
so leave a message
and have a great day. Thanks.

02:03.373 --> 02:07.311
Anyway, the point is that I am sad,

02:08.086 --> 02:09.930
and I miss you,

02:10.045 --> 02:14.780
and I bitterly regret
of what I did,

02:15.009 --> 02:18.470
and it would be very,
very nice if you called,

02:18.471 --> 02:21.370
or... in fact,
if we could see each other.

02:22.225 --> 02:26.562
I hope you're getting the gifts.
I know they're not all perfect.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.356
The ice sculpture,
I concede, was a disaster.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.442
I did specify that they shouldn't
leave it if you weren't home,

02:32.443 --> 02:34.153
and I will be suing.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.405
Talking of which,
I must get back to work.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.047
I'm actually in court. I have a man...

02:44.247 --> 02:47.416
Isn't this a beautiful view?
You could pay for this whole apartment

02:47.417 --> 02:49.668
just by charging people
to come and look at this.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.607
And if you like this,
you're going to love this,

02:53.923 --> 02:59.317
what I call the ballroom
or the grand salon.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.931
It's the perfect combination
of classic architecture...

03:02.932 --> 03:04.993
and understated elegance.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.739
You're pregnant?

03:18.740 --> 03:21.485
I mean, if you're planning
on having a baby,

03:21.486 --> 03:24.885
this is the most magical place.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.140
How many children do you have?

03:27.207 --> 03:31.680
How many? Let me see, I have...
Well, I have zero.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.941
My husband and I are separated.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.145
I know what you're thinking,
the clock is ticking, right?

03:40.929 --> 03:45.242
But I'm, you know...
I'm considering adoption,

03:46.142 --> 03:49.113
and you gotta stay optimistic. You know?

03:49.145 --> 03:51.957
Don't get down on yourself.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.109
Mr. Morgan, I have the depositions
on the Anderson case for you.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.070
Excellent. I hear it's a page-turner.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.322
Now, where are we on the star front?

04:00.323 --> 04:03.533
Well, you can buy
and name a star "Meryl".

04:03.534 --> 04:07.788
It's $75, and you get a celestial map
and a certificate.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.707
Well, I was really looking for something
more impressive.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.894
Can I buy a constellation?

04:12.919 --> 04:16.391
I don't know. You can buy a black hole.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.714
I'm not sure a black hole
sends exactly the right message

04:18.716 --> 04:20.384
at this point in our relationship.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.821
Somewhat redundant.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.764
Thank you.

04:25.765 --> 04:29.643
And thank you to everyone
at the National Breast Cancer Foundation.

04:29.644 --> 04:34.064
I'm so honored to be here tonight
on behalf of Park Avenue Realty.

04:34.065 --> 04:38.413
Thank you to Jimmy, my waiter,
at table number two. Yes, you.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.544
I'm not done with my dessert yet.

04:42.824 --> 04:46.512
This disease represents a crisis.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.622
Are we going to use this crisis
to come out

04:50.623 --> 04:55.733
stronger, better and more powerful
than ever before?

04:57.046 --> 04:58.936
You bet we are.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.729
But...

05:05.096 --> 05:07.191
But what that means...

05:14.397 --> 05:16.492
I'm sorry.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.501
Well, I...

05:21.738 --> 05:25.210
Basically, what I'm saying is,

05:25.950 --> 05:28.716
we want your money right now.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.885
So...

05:36.044 --> 05:38.435
- Great speech.
- Thank you.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.260
And you look fantastic tonight,
by the way.

05:40.261 --> 05:41.590
Thank you.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.426
I still don't entirely understand
what you're doing here.

05:44.427 --> 05:48.069
Well, breast cancer.
I'm against it.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.808
Look, I just want to talk. I'll talk now,
I'll talk later, I'll talk tomorrow.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.269
I'll talk at lunch, dinner,
brunch, snack time.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.160
Okay, okay. I get it.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.940
You are available for talking.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.002
Yes. Yes.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.964
Hey, Jackie.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.177
Jackie, how very nice.
How are you?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.671
Mr. Morgan.

06:12.663 --> 06:14.581
What do I have tomorrow?

06:14.582 --> 06:16.017
The PETA lunch.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.127
Barbecue, I imagine.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.379
What about after lunch?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.798
Excuse me.
Hello, Mrs. Morgan.

06:22.799 --> 06:23.882
Hi, Adam.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.385
After lunch,
you have the Farmer conference call.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.636
Do I dare ask about dinner?

06:27.637 --> 06:29.971
Meryl's doing a showing
at 7 o'clock for Mr. Rabelais.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.192
We've got Mr. Thompson
for dinner at 7:00.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.935
Hey, you know,
I think it would just be easier...

06:34.936 --> 06:37.854
if Jackie and Adam
spoke to each other.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.416
- Excellent idea.
- Excuse us.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.860
What happens with Paul after lunch?

06:43.861 --> 06:46.988
- Well, he's got...
- Don't mumble, Adam. Enunciate.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.491
- How's the apartment?
- It's good.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.007
So much more space
without the golf clubs.

06:51.008 --> 06:52.077
Yes.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.621
- How's the hotel?
- It's nice. It's nice.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.581
There's no one setting
the snooze alarm for 15 minutes...

06:56.582 --> 06:58.166
before they actually want to wake up,
so that's nice.

06:58.167 --> 07:01.336
Yes, and I've really enjoyed not having
anyone walk into the master bedroom

07:01.337 --> 07:03.964
wearing their shoes and trailing dirt
and germs from all over the city.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.674
- That must be very, very nice.
- It is.

07:05.675 --> 07:09.112
As is not stepping on discarded
Lady Gillettes in the shower,

07:10.012 --> 07:12.347
which I have actually come to miss.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.474
I can push Mr. Rabelais to 9:00

07:14.475 --> 07:16.184
and Adam can reschedule
Mr. Morgan's dinner.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.311
- I think I can if I...
- Just do it. Be a man.

07:18.312 --> 07:23.376
Excellent.
Then shall we say Daniel at 7:00?

07:24.152 --> 07:25.667
Okay.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.582
- Great. Terrific.
- Great. Good night.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.591
Good night.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.772
So...

07:46.549 --> 07:49.885
Did you get the yucca?
I know you like plants.

07:49.886 --> 07:54.108
And far, far away,
there is now a galaxy called Meryl.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.103
You have to stop sending things.
It's just getting very awkward.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.689
I understand. I will. I promise.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.955
I just have one more little thing.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.913
Okay, look, I know you always wanted us
to go and I procrastinated,

08:17.914 --> 08:19.498
but I thought this might make up for it.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.542
Dr. Tobin is apparently
the best marriage counselor in the city.

08:22.543 --> 08:26.356
Oh, no, I know who she is.
I found her duplex on Madison.

08:26.422 --> 08:29.063
Okay. And the Lerners recommended her.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.983
- Eric and Fiona?
- Yes.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.054
- They've been divorced a year.
- They have, they have.

08:35.056 --> 08:38.183
But the one thing they do agree on
is how much they love Dr. Tobin.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.768
Apparently, she wrote some book.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.938
Yes. The Magic Marriage Myth.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.732
You see? You are so well-read.
I really miss that.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.860
It's all about people's expectations
that their spouse will be the answer

08:48.861 --> 08:52.614
to all their problems when, in fact,
they should be facing reality

08:52.615 --> 08:55.961
and not asking their partners
for more than they can give.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.004
Brilliant. Brilliant.

08:58.955 --> 09:04.019
I don't know. I find her theory
kind of depressing, don't you?

09:05.670 --> 09:09.107
Yep. Yep, yeah, if you do.

09:09.590 --> 09:13.608
Can you please stop being so agreeable?
Please?

09:14.804 --> 09:16.694
Whatever you say.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.887
- So.
- So.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.747
So, you know,
I have to do a showing tonight,

09:42.748 --> 09:45.125
and I'm gonna pick up my client
at his townhouse.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.686
Yes.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.681
Do you wanna walk with me?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.339
- Absolutely. Yes.
- Okay.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.717
Adam, we are gonna walk.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.510
- You're going to walk?
- Yes.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.596
Is everything all right?
Did we do something wrong?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.942
No. Everything's okay.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.742
You did something wrong.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.778
Here comes the rain.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.420
You slept with someone else, Paul.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.593
You are not good
at talking about the weather.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.203
All right, it's...

10:22.204 --> 10:26.438
It's overcast
with 100% chance of precipitation.

10:27.376 --> 10:30.295
- You slept with someone else.
- I am sorry.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.757
I was confused.
I was an idiot. I was wrong.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.025
I made a terrible mistake. I love you.

10:39.263 --> 10:41.483
Do you still love me at all?

10:45.353 --> 10:51.399
I don't know if I can sort of love you
or love you a little.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.734
Well, I'm fine with it.

10:52.735 --> 10:57.208
Honestly, I can get by with a little
less love for a while. Maybe years.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.045
That's not me.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.634
I have to go. I have the meeting.

11:10.878 --> 11:14.816
Look, I just think
we should give Dr. Tobin a chance.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.019
- You know...
- Hey, there's my client.

11:19.261 --> 11:22.138
What is he doing in the rain
without an umbrella?

11:22.139 --> 11:25.076
What are we doing in the rain
without an umbrella?

11:25.726 --> 11:27.662
Mr. Rabelais?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.331
Mister...

11:31.399 --> 11:32.834
God!

11:51.627 --> 11:53.437
- Run!
- Stop!

11:54.797 --> 11:55.922
- Get in!
- What is your problem?

11:55.923 --> 11:59.269
- I almost ran you over!
- There's a man up there with a gun!

12:02.763 --> 12:05.223
The man who was murdered tonight,
Girard Rabelais,

12:05.224 --> 12:06.975
was an international arms dealer.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.394
The FBI was moving in to convict him,

12:09.395 --> 12:13.208
so Rabelais was working with us
to capture this man,

12:13.357 --> 12:15.497
Anton Forenski.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.319
And we think that's why
Forenski had him killed.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.837
We find the murderer,
maybe he leads us to Forenski.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.534
And you're gonna be our star witnesses.

12:24.535 --> 12:28.553
But right now, I just wanna concentrate
on keeping you safe.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.768
What do you mean, "safe"?

12:32.001 --> 12:35.170
- This guy's still out there.
- Yeah, but he doesn't know who we are.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.757
I'm gonna give you 24-hour protection
at your apartment anyway.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.695
Well, we don't live together.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.304
He's at a hotel 'cause we're separated.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.639
My wife and I see someone once a week.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.577
It's not, by any chance,
Dr. Tobin, is it?

12:51.979 --> 12:54.230
I know it's been a rough night,
so get some rest,

12:54.231 --> 12:55.523
and I'll talk to both of you tomorrow.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.108
- Okay.
- Right.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.193
- Mrs. Morgan.
- Yes?

12:58.194 --> 13:00.695
This is Marshal Henderson.
He'll be taking care of you.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.666
- Hello.
- Ma'am.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.919
Do you want me to stay tonight?

13:06.452 --> 13:09.924
No, no. I think I'm gonna be fine
with Marshal Henderson.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.208
If you think he can handle it. Well...

13:13.209 --> 13:16.180
Mrs. Morgan,
I have your car right over here.

13:17.379 --> 13:20.048
- Well, good night.
- Good night. Good... Yeah.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.675
Mr. Morgan, Marshal Ferber.

13:22.676 --> 13:26.113
- Evening, sir.
- Evening. Evening.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.598
You're in good hands.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.160
Yes. Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.112
Yeah, it's done.

13:33.395 --> 13:37.367
That is good news, Vincent.
We'll meet tomorrow on the island.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.413
No problem.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.429
Hello? Hi, Marshal Lasky.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.502
You're gonna send someone
to relieve Marshal Henderson.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.420
That's good, because, you know,
he's been out there all night.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.588
He must be...

14:00.589 --> 14:04.092
Can you hold on just a second?
My intercom is ringing.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.485
Okay, I'm just gonna put you
on hold. Okay.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.941
Coming.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.485
Hi, Mike.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.771
Yep, okay. Thank you.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.161
Thank you.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.443
Hi. So I guess your guy's already here,

14:22.444 --> 14:26.837
because the doorman said
they just sent a police officer up.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.550
What?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.749
Hey, how you doing?

14:36.750 --> 14:38.640
Okay, okay. Okay.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.561
- Get back inside!
- What...

14:45.801 --> 14:47.361
Oh, my God.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.190
Oh, my God!

14:52.600 --> 14:54.740
Help!

15:06.071 --> 15:08.041
Stop pushing the buttons.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.905
There's an emergency.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.067
Well, I certainly hope so, Marshal.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.060
Thank you. Do you mind?
Do you mind?

15:37.061 --> 15:38.655
Not at all.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.149
We checked
the building's security camera,

15:43.150 --> 15:46.246
but he was pretty careful
about keeping his head down.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.572
So is Marshal Henderson okay?

15:49.573 --> 15:51.501
He was wearing his vest.
He'll be alright.

15:51.502 --> 15:53.701
But this guy is still out there.

15:53.702 --> 15:56.704
I recommend you both enter
the Witness Relocation Program.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.265
- What?
- What?

15:59.416 --> 16:01.542
- Hang on. Hang on.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

16:01.543 --> 16:06.047
Do you mean where they send you out
into the middle of nowhere?

16:06.048 --> 16:08.508
- Yeah? Oh, no.
- Okay, I'll tell you what.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.410
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Why don't we...

16:09.411 --> 16:12.345
Why not just look at all the options,
because I'm sure there are options.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.180
And where? What?
Where do we go?

16:14.181 --> 16:16.434
We can't reveal that
until you're on the jet.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.449
There's a jet?

16:18.727 --> 16:22.397
- So, it's out of the city?
- Here's what I think we should do.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.606
Let's just stay logical...

16:23.607 --> 16:25.274
and examine all the parameters,
if that's possible.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.318
I can't leave. I can't leave.
I have a company to run.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.444
Well, we've both
got companies to run,

16:28.445 --> 16:29.529
- so that's important, but I think...
- Right.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.572
Right. So, who runs my business?

16:31.573 --> 16:33.700
All I'm saying is, I think
there are other things which should...

16:33.701 --> 16:35.743
- And what abou tall of our friends...
- For instance...

16:35.744 --> 16:36.661
and our family?

16:36.662 --> 16:40.248
What, we just...
we just up and disappear?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.144
I mean, we'd leave?
That's crazy.

16:42.145 --> 16:44.544
That's nuts.
Is that what you're suggesting?

16:44.545 --> 16:45.753
Well, we don't know
what he's suggesting...

16:45.754 --> 16:47.714
because you haven't actually
stopped talking yet, so...

16:47.715 --> 16:49.007
- Well...
- Excuse me.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.592
This isn't the first time
we've done this.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.678
We'll get a list of people to contact.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.514
But first,
we've got to get you to a safe location.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.766
And what happens
if you never find this man?

16:58.767 --> 16:59.934
We'll find him.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.437
In the meantime,
we put you in a temporary spot

17:02.438 --> 17:04.521
until we can find a more permanent site.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.566
What do you mean by "permanent"?

17:06.567 --> 17:09.277
I don't mean permanent.
I mean official site.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.903
Yeah, but you said permanent.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.448
So if you don't catch this guy,

17:13.449 --> 17:16.159
then the official site
becomes the permanent site?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.952
Right, so why don't we just let him
explain that bit.

17:17.953 --> 17:22.517
Oh, no. No, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

17:22.624 --> 17:25.460
Really, I can't. I'm, you know...

17:25.461 --> 17:29.854
I'm a New Yorker. You know,
I was born here. This is my home.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.467
I've had bagels in other parts
of the country.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.010
I don't even like Connecticut.

17:34.011 --> 17:37.448
This man is a professional killer.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.475
He found you in one night,
and he'll keep coming back.

17:40.476 --> 17:44.243
Wouldn't you rather live someplace else
than die in New York?

17:46.523 --> 17:47.992
Meryl?

17:51.320 --> 17:52.612
I'm thinking.

17:52.613 --> 17:56.881
There's nothing to think about.
If you wanna live, you're out of options.

17:58.535 --> 18:03.804
I'm sorry, I don't mean to drag
our personal problems into this,

18:03.957 --> 18:06.209
but at this exact moment,

18:06.210 --> 18:09.837
I can't commit to spending
the rest of my life with my husband.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.308
I know exactly how you feel.

18:13.759 --> 18:17.345
This is just a temporary location.
You'll be there a week at most.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.514
We'll look into arranging
separate sites afterwards,

18:19.515 --> 18:23.078
but first, we've got to get you
out of the city.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.068
You... I don't...

18:32.069 --> 18:36.712
You won't tell me where I'm going,
so I don't know how to dress.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.925
This, 'cause it's pretty?

18:58.804 --> 19:02.276
Now that we're on the jet,
can you tell us where we're going?

19:02.349 --> 19:04.285
Ray, Wyoming.

19:07.354 --> 19:10.120
Is that anywhere near Phil, Wyoming?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.668
Here are your temporary IDs.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.490
You'll be in seclusion,

19:19.491 --> 19:20.711
but just in case
you run into anybody,

19:20.712 --> 19:23.411
we don't want you using
your real identities.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.495
Meryl Foster?

19:24.496 --> 19:26.747
You'll be under the care
of Marshal Clay Wheeler.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.624
He's also the sheriff in town.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.627
Meryl, you're Clay's cousin from Chicago.

19:31.628 --> 19:35.506
You haven't seen him in five years,
since he visited you and Paul.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.649
- Any questions?
- Do we get a movie?

20:02.451 --> 20:04.842
We're here. It's time.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.684
Marshal Wheeler
will take good care of you.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.380
You're not coming?

20:16.381 --> 20:19.693
I'm going back to find this guy.
Good luck.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.887
Goodbye.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.097
Yeah, thank you, Marshal.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.658
Thank you.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.037
Thank you, Marshal. Thank you.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.486
Is that him?

21:13.772 --> 21:16.333
If it is, I feel safer already.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.661
Oh, my God.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.177
What?

21:33.792 --> 21:36.262
You're gonna love this.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.884
Well, should we be writing this down?

21:43.885 --> 21:48.244
Don't worry, they're all over town.
The posters, not the bears.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.600
Hi, are you...

21:51.601 --> 21:54.447
Glad to see you? You bet.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.409
- Take your bag?
- Thank you.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.067
- Thanks.
- Come with me.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.538
Try to stay awake there, Tom.

22:03.989 --> 22:08.883
Welcome to Wyoming.
I'm U. S. Marshal Clay Wheeler.

22:08.952 --> 22:10.661
Thank you, hello.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.289
Hello. I'm Meryl Morgan.

22:13.290 --> 22:16.056
No, I don't think so, ma'am.

22:16.793 --> 22:19.128
You mean I've been wrong all these years?

22:19.129 --> 22:21.440
You're Meryl Foster.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.439
I'm your cousin.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.904
You cold?

22:28.638 --> 22:30.723
We were just only allowed
to bring one bag,

22:30.724 --> 22:34.101
so I just packed a ton of underwear
and a strapless gown.

22:34.102 --> 22:35.742
Same here.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.359
Temperature really drops
around here at night.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.422
Let's see about getting you
something warm.

22:44.571 --> 22:47.948
Thank you. I mean, if there's,
you know, any place that's open.

22:47.949 --> 22:50.618
Sure, there's a Bargain Barn.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.162
I've gotta swing by there anyway.

22:53.163 --> 22:56.248
I've never been to a Bargain Barn.

22:56.249 --> 22:58.125
Are you pulling my leg?

22:58.126 --> 22:59.794
They don't have them in New York.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.962
What's that got to do with anything?

23:01.963 --> 23:05.560
Well, that's why I've never been to one.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.437
I'm still not following you.

23:13.725 --> 23:17.978
They don't have Bargain Barns
in New York,

23:17.979 --> 23:21.701
so that's why I've never been to one.

23:22.317 --> 23:26.153
We've also never been to one in Chicago,
which is where we're from.

23:26.154 --> 23:28.920
- I see.
- Oh, jeez.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.215
It's huge.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.263
- I had no idea.
- Astonishing.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.480
It's all about bulk.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.507
This can't be right.

23:46.508 --> 23:49.677
A sweater for $9. 99?

23:49.678 --> 23:52.471
It's not right. Look, it's two for one.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.362
Come on.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.851
Where is menswear?

23:56.852 --> 23:58.412
Wait a minute.

24:19.374 --> 24:21.000
Okay, look, you see that woman?

24:21.001 --> 24:23.972
See that woman?
Guess what's in those bags?

24:24.963 --> 24:27.979
- French bread?
- Guns. Big guns.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.760
- Oh, Lord, she's coming.
- Oh, my God, it's Sarah Palin.

24:31.761 --> 24:38.282
Actually, the name's Emma, Emma Wheeler,
but you can call me Deputy Wheeler.

24:38.727 --> 24:42.415
- So... So you're married.
- Oh, yeah.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.774
Just what you needed, hon.
A couple more guns.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.819
I love them. Do you hunt, Meryl?

24:48.820 --> 24:53.805
Just for bargains.
Actually, I'm a member of PETA.

24:55.202 --> 24:58.037
"People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals".

24:58.038 --> 25:02.807
So am I. Except mine's
"People for Eating Tasty Animals".

25:04.419 --> 25:07.811
You gotta know Emma
to appreciate her humor.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.110
Sometimes that doesn't even help.

25:11.551 --> 25:16.889
Hey, I just wanna say that I think
what you people are doing is very brave,

25:16.890 --> 25:19.767
and it'll be an honor to protect you.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.311
I hope you'll be real comfortable
here with us.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.771
Thank you. Thank you very much.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.565
I must say, I'd imagined Ray to be,
you know, less modern.

25:26.566 --> 25:29.568
But this Bargain Barn is fantastic,

25:29.569 --> 25:32.363
and I saw a movie theater down the road,
an Applebee's.

25:32.364 --> 25:36.325
Well, this is Cody.
Ray's 45 miles that way,

25:36.326 --> 25:39.672
and there is no Bargain Barn there.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.784
Here's Ray.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.752
That was it.

26:13.989 --> 26:17.085
Could we do it again?
I think I missed it.

26:17.242 --> 26:21.260
Well, if that's Ray, where are we going?

26:21.329 --> 26:23.247
A few miles outside of town.

26:23.248 --> 26:26.469
We like to get away
from the hustle and bustle.

26:32.591 --> 26:36.154
Come on in. Watch your step, there.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.349
Yep.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.866
This is it, home sweet home.

26:45.770 --> 26:49.523
Well, it's lovely.
It's very, very nice.

26:49.524 --> 26:52.040
Yes, I love what you've done
with the...

26:52.861 --> 26:54.751
the heads.

26:54.863 --> 26:59.306
Thanks. Yeah,
we killed all these animals ourselves.

26:59.307 --> 27:02.536
Oh, that's great. I hate when you have
the decorator do it for you.

27:02.537 --> 27:05.556
Well, I got a brother over in Cheyenne
who's a taxidermist, so...

27:05.557 --> 27:07.583
Oh, that's handy... uh...

27:07.584 --> 27:09.543
any word from New York?

27:09.544 --> 27:11.112
No, ma'am.

27:11.113 --> 27:13.412
So, you folks hungry?
We got plenty to eat.

27:13.413 --> 27:17.217
Um... no, not me. I had my fill
on the forced-out-of-New-York flight.

27:17.218 --> 27:19.404
- Chicago.
- Chicago.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.987
Well, you probably wanna be getting
some shut-eye.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.557
I'll show you to your room.

27:23.558 --> 27:26.060
- Okay.
- Hope you'll be comfortable here.

27:26.061 --> 27:30.189
We fixed up the spare bedroom.
Not exactly the Ritz.

27:30.190 --> 27:33.067
We usually only have
one witness at a time.

27:33.068 --> 27:36.631
The last one
was Vito "the Butcher" Emmanuel.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.823
Murdered five people
before he turned state's evidence.

27:39.824 --> 27:43.410
- So you actually do this all the time?
- Yeah.

27:43.411 --> 27:47.873
About 10 years ago, the government asked
if we'd hide somebody for a week.

27:47.874 --> 27:52.017
Ever since then, a couple of times
a year, they bring somebody by.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.398
Been kind of interesting, actually.

27:55.256 --> 27:57.692
Now they want me to retire.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.443
So, you two are gonna be our last.

28:03.098 --> 28:07.017
Well, it's an honor,
and it's a lovely witness room,

28:07.018 --> 28:13.755
but Mr. Morgan...
Mr. Foster and I are separated.

28:13.983 --> 28:17.546
We are thinking
of seeing a therapist, yeah.

28:19.239 --> 28:23.100
So how do you want to handle
the sleeping arrangements, then?

28:23.101 --> 28:25.003
Uh, well, I...
I can sleep on a couch.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.483
- No, no, no, I'll sleep on the couch.
- No, no, 'cause...

28:26.484 --> 28:28.764
I'm a lousy sleeper anyway.
Really, I... I'd...

28:28.765 --> 28:32.387
I'd be fine on a couch.
And do you have cable?

28:32.877 --> 28:36.235
We got an antenna. Got a bunch of DVDs.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.394
John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, mostly.

28:39.843 --> 28:43.189
That's great. That's great.

28:43.471 --> 28:46.390
But I see you have a computer.

28:46.391 --> 28:50.477
So that means that you have Internet?
You're online?

28:50.478 --> 28:53.199
We do, but you would need a code.

28:53.523 --> 28:54.982
Which you're not gonna give me.

28:54.983 --> 28:59.403
No. Trying to contact somebody
back home's just too big a risk.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.405
And I guess the same goes for the phone?

29:01.406 --> 29:04.658
'Cause I just have a couple of things
I have to check on.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.243
Yes, if I could make one quick call,
it would be...

29:06.244 --> 29:09.886
Yeah, and you know,
you could supervise the calls.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.811
There's no dial tone.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.771
There's a code.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.716
So I guess that is about it.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.551
There's towels and soap in the bath.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.898
Great. Terrific. Is there a code?

29:29.434 --> 29:31.825
Sorry. Silly.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.738
You sure you're going to be happy
on that thing?

29:42.739 --> 29:45.926
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.004
All right.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.455
Good night.

29:51.456 --> 29:54.598
Night, night.
Night, everyone.

29:56.252 --> 29:59.338
Look, Paul,
I know how hard you're trying.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.488
Really, I do.
I'm not completely oblivious.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.552
And believe me, it would...

30:05.553 --> 30:09.775
It would be so much easier
if I could just make myself forget.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.660
But

30:14.479 --> 30:17.871
when I look at you, I just feel regret

30:18.691 --> 30:20.786
and sadness

30:20.819 --> 30:24.507
and a deep desire
to see you suffer intense pain.

30:25.281 --> 30:27.282
Listen, that's not a problem.
That is not a problem.

30:27.283 --> 30:31.161
I am more than willing to hurt myself.
Or would you prefer to do it?

30:31.162 --> 30:32.371
Whatever it takes.

30:32.372 --> 30:36.685
Look, just tell me what to do. Tell me.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.058
I don't know.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.421
I don't know. I'm...

30:41.422 --> 30:45.592
Yeah. Look, the thing is, Meryl,
I'm just trying to be realistic.

30:45.593 --> 30:48.887
You know, I'm human, I made a mistake.
I'm not perfect.

30:48.888 --> 30:50.824
No, I know you're not.

30:51.683 --> 30:55.780
But I was so in love with you,

30:57.605 --> 30:59.916
and now I'm just...

31:03.820 --> 31:05.505
I'm just...

31:07.407 --> 31:09.468
I'm so disappointed,

31:13.663 --> 31:16.133
and I don't trust you anymore.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.232
Okay.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.695
Good night.

31:31.639 --> 31:33.358
Night.

33:10.697 --> 33:13.839
Jackie, did you hear about the Morgans?

33:16.244 --> 33:18.328
Of course I heard.
I'm totally devastated.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.831
- They're in protective custody.
- Adam, I heard.

33:20.832 --> 33:24.269
- What are we going to do?
- What can we do? We can't...

33:24.919 --> 33:28.311
- Yes?
- There's a client here for Mrs. Morgan.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.893
Sure, send him back.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.427
Can I help you?

33:33.428 --> 33:35.762
If you're busy, I can come back later.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.984
Not at all. He was just leaving.

33:40.727 --> 33:45.188
Yeah, I'm in the market for a 2-bedroom.
A friend referred me to Meryl Morgan.

33:45.189 --> 33:48.160
- Would you have a seat?
- Yeah.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.422
Excuse me.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.090
Call me.

33:59.037 --> 34:03.331
I'm Jackie, Mrs. Morgan's assistant.
She's not in today.

34:03.332 --> 34:06.895
Can I get one of the other agents
to talk to you?

34:07.628 --> 34:09.420
You know,
if she's as good as everyone says,

34:09.422 --> 34:11.965
then I'm sure
she's probably worth the wait.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.257
She is.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.761
All right. Well, I'm sorry
to have taken up your time, then.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.527
Not at all.

34:19.474 --> 34:22.411
That's a nice looking muffin, there.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.706
Enjoy your breakfast.

34:38.034 --> 34:41.161
Howdy. Hope I didn't wake you.

34:41.161 --> 34:45.665
Oh, no. No. I didn't really sleep.
It's too quiet here.

34:45.666 --> 34:47.476
You hungry?

34:49.837 --> 34:51.773
It smells good.

34:53.257 --> 34:57.024
Now, that's impressive.
I've never turned my oven on.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.554
Wow, look at that,
fire comes out and everything.

34:59.555 --> 35:03.058
Do you want sausage or bacon or both
with your eggs and pancakes?

35:03.059 --> 35:06.576
Oh. No, no, thanks.
I'm actually a vegetarian.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.814
Morning.

35:08.815 --> 35:14.300
I got news for you, Sheriff.
Your cousin, here, is a vegetarian.

35:15.571 --> 35:19.032
You never think it's gonna happen
in your own family.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.367
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.383
Morning. Morning.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.703
Morning.

35:23.704 --> 35:26.220
- Morning.
- How'd you sleep?

35:26.833 --> 35:30.210
Not brilliantly.
It's very, very quiet, isn't it?

35:30.211 --> 35:32.546
I thought I could actually hear
my cells dividing.

35:32.547 --> 35:35.048
Yeah, I know. I kept praying for a siren.

35:35.049 --> 35:38.135
Yes, or a rumbling subway or something.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.983
Speaking of New York,
have you heard anything?

35:42.431 --> 35:46.101
No, ma'am.
And you can ask every 5 minutes.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.914
When they tell me, I'll tell you.

35:49.397 --> 35:53.039
I saw a photo of a young man.
Is that your son?

35:53.401 --> 35:56.998
That's our boy, Clay Jr.

35:57.446 --> 35:58.905
Does he live in Ray, too?

35:58.906 --> 36:03.076
No, he married a girl from Omaha
so he moved to the big city.

36:03.077 --> 36:06.298
- The big city?
- Omaha.

36:06.497 --> 36:09.875
Here you go.
Sunny-side eggs, sausage with bacon,

36:09.876 --> 36:12.961
home fries, homemade biscuits
and country gravy.

36:12.962 --> 36:17.150
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, thanks. Just an angiogram.

36:20.970 --> 36:25.283
We're gonna make our rounds.
Probably best for you to stay put.

36:25.391 --> 36:28.059
Fewer people see you, the safer you are.

36:28.060 --> 36:31.897
Which is a shame, 'cause Ray
is the friendliest place on Earth.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.858
Help yourself to anything in the fridge
if you're hungry.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.443
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.709
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:43.451 --> 36:46.172
I can't believe this is happening.

36:47.163 --> 36:49.372
Well, at least you didn't have
the whole breakfast.

36:49.373 --> 36:52.606
I feel my organs shutting down
one by one.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.797
I thought Disneyland
was the friendliest place on Earth.

36:57.798 --> 37:00.091
No, no, no. Disneyland
is the happiest place on Earth.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.593
Ray is the friendliest place.

37:01.594 --> 37:05.066
People probably get them confused
all the time.

37:09.810 --> 37:12.312
What if we never get out of here?

37:12.313 --> 37:15.357
What if we never go to
Lincoln Center again, or see the Mets,

37:15.358 --> 37:19.277
or see our friends, or sit on the
Great Lawn reading The New York Times,

37:19.278 --> 37:23.657
or watch Shakespeare in the Park,
or go to Nobu, or order Chinese.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.868
Oh, God. Do you know
how long it would take to order Chinese?

37:26.869 --> 37:28.620
It'd be weeks
and it would be cold!

37:28.621 --> 37:31.164
Okay, stop, stop, stop.
Now, listen to me. Listen to me.

37:31.165 --> 37:33.750
We are here, and there's nothing
we can do about it.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.085
There's no phone calls to make,

37:35.086 --> 37:38.421
there's no connections to work,
there's no favors to call in.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.561
I think that you should treat it
as a vacation,

37:40.562 --> 37:43.441
a welcome break
in your busy schedule.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.429
- Okay.
- Good.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.821
Okay, you're right. Okay.

37:50.184 --> 37:53.937
There. Lovely.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.614
Oh, God, I'm going mad!
I can't take it!

37:55.615 --> 37:57.013
Well, at least you gave it
your best shot.

37:57.014 --> 37:59.253
That's really all we can ask.

38:01.862 --> 38:05.254
- They did say not to leave.
- Oh, come on.

38:06.450 --> 38:09.661
Well, perhaps I should come with you,
to protect you.

38:09.662 --> 38:12.474
And I'd really rather not be left here
on my own.

38:33.227 --> 38:38.417
Oh, God, I can't breathe.
The air is too clean. Oh, my God.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.161
Oh, God.

38:43.404 --> 38:47.092
- All right, I'm gonna shower.
- Okay. I'm gonna...

38:55.499 --> 38:56.968
Paul?

38:58.627 --> 39:01.004
- Paul, don't move.
- Sorry?

39:01.005 --> 39:03.441
There's a bear behind you.

39:04.258 --> 39:06.398
Yes. Yes, there is.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.263
Oh, shit. Just, shit.

39:10.264 --> 39:15.158
Wait! No, no, no, no! No, don't run!
Don't run. The poster said not to run.

39:15.770 --> 39:18.438
Wait, hold on. I'm gonna go get it, okay?
Hold on.

39:18.439 --> 39:22.787
What? Come back. Meryl! Meryl, come back.
Come back, please.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.612
Meryl. Meryl. Meryl. Meryl.

39:25.613 --> 39:30.507
Okay. Oh, God. Okay. Well, "Keep calm".

39:31.619 --> 39:37.389
Okay. "Avoid direct eye contact,
and speak in a soft monotone".

39:39.085 --> 39:41.100
Nice to meet you.

39:41.170 --> 39:45.048
My wife is a member of PETA.
I have been meaning to join.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.133
- "Don't shoot a bear"...
- I don't have a gun.

39:47.134 --> 39:50.303
"because the bear
almost always lives long enough...

39:50.304 --> 39:52.389
"to maul the shooter severely".

39:52.390 --> 39:54.349
I don't have a gun!

39:54.350 --> 39:57.310
Soothing. Soothing, soothing.

39:57.311 --> 40:01.189
So sorry. Sorry.
I don't have a gun. No gun.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.457
- Wait. There's one last thing.
- What is it?

40:05.569 --> 40:07.320
You know, you don't need to hear this.

40:07.321 --> 40:09.406
- What is it?
- Okay.

40:09.407 --> 40:13.243
"As a last resort,
assume a cannonball position

40:13.244 --> 40:17.455
"covering your neck and your head
with your hands and your arms".

40:17.456 --> 40:18.623
I didn't need to hear that.

40:18.624 --> 40:21.918
Well, I know that! I told you that! See?
You never listen!

40:21.919 --> 40:23.711
- This is exactly what you do...
- Could we not do this now?

40:23.712 --> 40:25.255
...every single time.
- Jesus.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.590
- Oh, my God, Paul! He's coming!
- Don't scream. Be soothing.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.175
- Run!
- It says not to run.

40:29.176 --> 40:34.240
Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!

40:36.016 --> 40:39.249
- Oh, my God. My eyes!
- Okay, he's going.

40:39.645 --> 40:41.980
Yeah, he's going. We're gonna be okay.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.524
- I'm blind! I can't see!
- Oh, my God.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.234
- Oh, wow, that was close.
- I can't see.

40:46.235 --> 40:47.670
My God.

41:00.124 --> 41:01.764
Oh, Lord.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.048
There you go.

41:09.049 --> 41:12.691
Okay. Let's have a look-see here.

41:13.804 --> 41:17.617
- You're from Chicago, Mrs. Foster?
- Yep, that's right.

41:17.933 --> 41:20.268
I've always dreamed about Chicago.

41:20.269 --> 41:23.521
Well, I'm sure one day you'll get there.

41:23.522 --> 41:27.369
Oh, no, I don't wanna go.
I just always dream about it.

41:30.154 --> 41:33.907
Is it gonna be much longer?
Because my husband is very uncomfortable.

41:33.908 --> 41:37.095
- Oh, Lord in heaven.
- Oh, yeah.

41:37.578 --> 41:41.846
Oh, look at him. He's a mess.
He should see a doctor.

41:47.254 --> 41:50.270
Laughter really is the best medicine.

41:53.010 --> 41:56.763
So, you sprayed yourself with bear spray,
Mr. Foster.

41:56.764 --> 42:00.975
Oh, no. Actually, I sprayed him.
I mean, unintentionally, of course.

42:00.976 --> 42:04.479
Anyway, do you think
maybe he should see a specialist?

42:04.480 --> 42:09.340
Well, I'm the only doctor in town,
so I'm about as special as it gets.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.861
Do everything from geriatrics
to pediatrics.

42:11.862 --> 42:14.447
Wow, well, don't wanna confuse
those two.

42:14.448 --> 42:16.338
No. No, you don't.

42:16.617 --> 42:20.620
That is the great thing about being a
doctor in a small town. You see it all.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.075
Anyway, physiologically
it's all the same.

42:23.076 --> 42:25.375
You know,
the body is the body.

42:25.376 --> 42:29.963
So, let's see if we can't take care
of that boo-boo in your eye, Mr. Foster.

42:29.964 --> 42:33.675
You see, just calling it a boo-boo
makes me feel better already.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.301
Let's go next door to the exam room.

42:35.302 --> 42:37.011
Say, would you like to come along,
Mrs. Foster?

42:37.012 --> 42:39.055
Oh, no, I'm fine. I'll wait here.

42:39.056 --> 42:43.369
Let me help you there, Mr. Foster.
Say, do you like stickers?

42:44.144 --> 42:47.866
Here, let's take a little visit
to the giraffe room.

43:29.982 --> 43:32.734
You've reached Trish Pinger
at the Gotham Adoption Agency.

43:32.735 --> 43:35.080
Please leave a message.

43:35.081 --> 43:36.195
Oh, um...

43:36.196 --> 43:38.564
Hi, Trish. This is Meryl Foster.

43:38.565 --> 43:41.159
I'm sorry,
Meryl Morgan calling. I just...

43:41.160 --> 43:46.331
I was just calling to thank you so much
for everything that you've done for me,

43:46.332 --> 43:49.792
but I'm now sort of
in the middle of something.

43:49.793 --> 43:53.606
I might be relocating,
I might be in New York,

43:53.714 --> 43:56.184
I might be God knows where.

43:56.759 --> 43:59.427
I bet I sound really stable
right now, right?

43:59.428 --> 44:03.571
Probably can't believe
you were gonna help me adopt a baby.

44:16.028 --> 44:18.419
Very soothing before bed.

44:21.408 --> 44:24.424
- Okay. Good night.
- Night.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.389
Paul?

44:35.130 --> 44:38.067
I called the Gotham Adoption Agency.

44:41.512 --> 44:44.449
I filed for adoption 2 months ago.

44:47.267 --> 44:48.861
You did?

44:49.812 --> 44:54.330
So I wanted to tell them
that I couldn't go through with it now.

45:00.489 --> 45:02.425
Two months ago, eh?

45:03.450 --> 45:05.743
Must've been a big decision for you.

45:05.744 --> 45:07.403
Well, I really thought
about telling you,

45:07.404 --> 45:11.229
but I didn't... really know
where we were at.

45:11.458 --> 45:13.459
And to be honest,

45:13.460 --> 45:16.003
you know, from the time that we started
having trouble getting pregnant,

45:16.004 --> 45:17.505
you weren't exactly supportive.

45:17.506 --> 45:20.466
Well, you know, I always find it almost
impossible to believe that you say that,

45:20.467 --> 45:23.261
because between the fertility doctors
and the injections

45:23.262 --> 45:25.012
and the woman
who chanted over my sperm...

45:25.013 --> 45:28.224
Oh, man, come on.
I have apologized for that so many times.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.934
...that I was pretty supportive.

45:29.935 --> 45:33.229
Was I enjoying having sex on a schedule
timed exactly to your ovulations?

45:33.230 --> 45:35.815
Maybe not as much as I should've done,
and I'm very sorry about that.

45:35.816 --> 45:38.943
Or talking about reproducing
every second of every day.

45:38.944 --> 45:42.947
It wasn't every second of every day.
I just wanted to be a mother.

45:42.948 --> 45:44.323
Yes, and I wanted to be a father.

45:44.324 --> 45:46.659
I was the one who suggested adoption
in the first place.

45:46.660 --> 45:48.995
Then why did we never meet
with an adoption agency?

45:48.996 --> 45:53.166
Because, by that time,
you had become so wired and so crazed

45:53.167 --> 45:55.752
that they would not have let us raise
a goldfish, let alone a baby.

45:55.753 --> 45:57.837
You know I was wired
from the hormone shots,

45:57.838 --> 46:00.506
and I am not normally that crazy.

46:00.507 --> 46:04.677
And instead of you staying home
and dealing with it,

46:04.678 --> 46:08.306
you flew off to LA on a business meeting,
and then you...

46:08.307 --> 46:10.349
- Oh, right.
- I know! I know. I know what I did.

46:10.350 --> 46:12.643
I slept with someone else, and I'm sorry.

46:12.644 --> 46:15.730
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:15.731 --> 46:17.231
I don't know how many times
I'm supposed to say it.

46:17.232 --> 46:19.692
I think you are being
completely irrational.

46:19.693 --> 46:22.028
These two are worse
than Vito the Butcher.

46:22.029 --> 46:24.197
I'd really prefer it if you'd not tell me
what I think.

46:24.198 --> 46:26.073
- It's quite annoying.
- I kind of like them.

46:26.074 --> 46:27.658
- Don't lawyer me.
- Fine!

46:27.659 --> 46:30.661
I wish there was some way
we could help them.

46:30.662 --> 46:32.622
Yeah. Muzzles.

46:32.623 --> 46:35.124
- I think you are being unreasonable.
- Well, you're wrong.

46:35.125 --> 46:38.972
Is that helpful? Is that constructive?
Is that mature?

46:39.254 --> 46:42.048
It's mature.
I don't know if it's "mature".

46:42.049 --> 46:45.968
Oh, that is mature, yes. Mock my accent.
Mock my heritage.

46:45.969 --> 46:49.202
We have got to get them out of the house.

46:51.225 --> 46:54.101
I didn't know what to do. There were all
these meetings that were set,

46:54.102 --> 46:55.978
- all these clients.
- You think you've got problems?

46:55.979 --> 46:58.898
She's the president of the firm.
Nothing happens here without her,

46:58.899 --> 47:01.275
and everyone is looking at me like,
"Where is she?"

47:01.276 --> 47:04.278
I'm gonna lose my job.
Without him, I'm superfluous.

47:04.279 --> 47:07.637
Well, I've got news for you.
Even with him...

47:08.909 --> 47:12.130
Meryl Morgan's office.
She's not in today.

47:12.538 --> 47:15.498
Hello, Miss Pinger.
Yes, from the adoption agency.

47:15.499 --> 47:19.062
What? Meryl called you. Yesterday.

47:19.211 --> 47:22.023
Do you happen to have that number?

47:23.006 --> 47:25.601
Yes, if you could just hold.

47:27.636 --> 47:31.108
Hold on, just one moment. Yes, go ahead.

47:33.600 --> 47:36.070
Thank you so much,
Miss Pinger. All right.

47:43.277 --> 47:46.498
This is Mike, Clarence,
Jackson and Windy.

47:46.697 --> 47:48.573
This is the one
we're gonna put you on, Meryl.

47:48.574 --> 47:52.368
No, sorry. No offense, Windy,
but I'm allergic to you.

47:52.369 --> 47:57.103
And I had, once, a very bad
horse experience. I was thrown.

47:58.333 --> 48:01.502
It was from the carousel in Central Park,
but still, you know.

48:01.503 --> 48:03.379
You ride, Paul?

48:03.380 --> 48:07.633
Well, I do a little bit, yes.
I had some lessons when I was a child.

48:07.634 --> 48:09.945
You had riding lessons?

48:10.512 --> 48:12.857
Well, I never knew that.

48:12.890 --> 48:15.349
Yeah, well,
I don't tell you everything, so...

48:15.350 --> 48:17.411
Yeah. I knew that.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.377
Go get her.

48:37.581 --> 48:43.294
Hey! Hey! I'm not on my horse!
I'm not on my horse!

48:43.295 --> 48:46.983
Get back on,
'cause we got target practice next.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.899
- Annie Oakley.
- Very good.

49:04.900 --> 49:07.916
All right. Come on, Meryl, your turn.

49:08.111 --> 49:10.237
All right, let's just get this over with.

49:10.238 --> 49:12.031
All right. This is a loaded gun,

49:12.032 --> 49:14.492
so you don't point it at another person
or your own foot.

49:14.493 --> 49:15.576
- Okay?
- Okay.

49:15.577 --> 49:18.764
And are you left-handed or right-handed?

49:19.122 --> 49:21.791
Well, you know,
I write with my left hand,

49:21.792 --> 49:24.001
but I play tennis and I play badminton
with my right hand.

49:24.002 --> 49:26.837
I text with my right hand. I cut, right?
I cut cake with my left hand.

49:26.838 --> 49:31.425
Okay, we're gonna do it like this.
Line it up through the sights to the can.

49:31.426 --> 49:34.220
Now, when that gun goes off,
it's gonna kick back

49:34.221 --> 49:36.639
- into your shoulder, okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.100
Don't put your finger on the trigger
till you're ready to shoot.

49:39.101 --> 49:40.820
All right.

49:53.115 --> 49:57.804
This is nothing. You should see
how long it takes her to order dinner.

50:11.967 --> 50:13.801
There you go.

50:13.802 --> 50:15.970
- Blew its head off.
- That was good.

50:15.971 --> 50:19.693
- Wow, it's very, very loud.
- Yeah. Yeah.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.976
No, no, no. 'Cause I got two more cans.

50:21.977 --> 50:24.311
I'm just gonna cock the gun for you.

50:24.312 --> 50:27.909
Fascinating. A week ago,
she was basically Amish.

50:28.150 --> 50:31.152
- All right. It's loaded and ready to go.
- Okay. Yeah, I know. Okay.

50:31.153 --> 50:34.841
Keep your finger off the trigger
till you're ready.

50:40.996 --> 50:42.371
Missed.

50:42.372 --> 50:44.665
- I think it's my turn now, isn't it?
- No, no, no, I'm not done yet.

50:44.666 --> 50:46.125
I think you'll find it's my turn.

50:46.126 --> 50:49.628
- I'm not done. I'm on a roll.
- You've had 2 bullets, now it's my turn.

50:49.629 --> 50:51.849
This thing is loaded.

50:51.965 --> 50:55.232
I'm gonna have to give you two
an NRA class.

50:55.552 --> 50:57.897
- Paul's turn.
- Thank you.

50:58.055 --> 51:00.241
You're rude. Selfish.

51:00.307 --> 51:03.824
- Just do like your wife did.
- Right, thank you.

51:04.811 --> 51:07.156
Get a hold of it, relax.

51:10.942 --> 51:12.981
- Just relax. Find your target.
- Mh-hm.

51:12.982 --> 51:14.991
- Take a deep breath.
- Mh-hm.

51:14.992 --> 51:16.211
Squeeze easy.

51:16.490 --> 51:20.382
Bollocks. God in heaven,
that hurt. Agony.

51:20.827 --> 51:22.661
- Missed.
- Absolute agony.

51:22.662 --> 51:24.198
Could you take that for me
just a second?

51:24.199 --> 51:25.998
I think I've really done
some damage.

51:25.999 --> 51:27.875
- Meryl, I think I have a welt.
- What?

51:27.876 --> 51:29.585
Quite a big welt.

51:29.586 --> 51:31.420
Look at that.
Do you see that?

51:31.421 --> 51:33.334
- Yes, it's quite big.
- Purple. Ugly.

51:33.335 --> 51:35.234
Like a little map of Ireland.

51:35.759 --> 51:38.427
Yeah, real easy to hurt your shoulder
shooting a rifle.

51:38.428 --> 51:40.068
I didn't.

51:40.138 --> 51:44.827
Could you just wait outside?
Play with a toy? Thank you.

51:46.019 --> 51:47.812
You ever shoot before, Meryl?

51:47.813 --> 51:50.272
Nope. Never held a gun before in my life.

51:50.273 --> 51:53.400
Although I could've used one
during some tense negotiations at work.

51:53.401 --> 51:54.902
I'm a real estate broker.

51:54.903 --> 51:57.113
- You kidding?
- No.

51:57.114 --> 52:00.961
My mom is getting on
and she's moving in with me.

52:02.077 --> 52:04.968
I can't get any bites on her house.

52:08.083 --> 52:10.126
Well, it's lovely.

52:10.127 --> 52:11.710
But, you know,
when the market's like this,

52:11.711 --> 52:14.922
you really need to focus more
on presentation.

52:14.923 --> 52:17.466
I mean, just, you know,
just off of the top of my head,

52:17.467 --> 52:21.595
I think maybe the chair
that's sitting on the front lawn,

52:21.596 --> 52:23.097
it looks very, very comfortable,

52:23.098 --> 52:26.517
but have you ever considered
moving it inside the house?

52:26.518 --> 52:27.953
No.

52:28.270 --> 52:31.063
Well, just think about it. It's...

52:31.064 --> 52:32.565
- I will.
- Okay.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.859
Would you mind coming out
and taking a look at the place?

52:34.860 --> 52:36.625
Not at all.

52:37.487 --> 52:39.071
Can you spare her, Paul?

52:39.072 --> 52:42.616
Yeah, absolutely.
Yes, I'm used to being separated.

52:42.617 --> 52:45.303
The shoulder, I mean. Shoulder.

52:45.328 --> 52:47.037
That's not separated.

52:47.038 --> 52:50.271
It's a tiny little bruise.
Wouldn't hurt a schoolgirl.

52:53.086 --> 52:55.477
- Hi there. Hey.
- Hey.

52:56.381 --> 52:57.715
How's your arm feeling?

52:57.716 --> 53:01.927
It's nothing. It's nothing. I just went
to the doc 'cause Meryl was so worried.

53:01.928 --> 53:04.944
Can I give you a hand, there?

53:05.265 --> 53:08.281
- If you're up to it.
- Yeah, no problem.

53:14.941 --> 53:19.445
So, I really just wanted to apologize

53:19.446 --> 53:22.698
for any trouble we may have caused you.
You know, I know there's been

53:22.699 --> 53:25.920
a certain amount of screaming
and shouting and so on.

53:26.578 --> 53:31.176
That's okay. I know what it's like.
Me and Clay had a few humdingers.

53:31.249 --> 53:32.843
Really?

53:33.418 --> 53:37.546
You see, that's quite comforting to hear,
'cause you two seem so happy.

53:37.547 --> 53:41.895
We are. But it doesn't mean we haven't
almost called it quits a few times.

53:42.177 --> 53:43.771
Really?

53:44.930 --> 53:48.933
How did you two patch things up,
if I might ask?

53:48.934 --> 53:50.449
Well,

53:52.646 --> 53:58.040
he bought me a Remington. 270 with
a night scope and "Emma" engraved on it.

53:58.610 --> 54:02.173
And he gave me some cows. I love cows.

54:02.906 --> 54:04.448
Brilliant. Brilliant.

54:04.449 --> 54:06.700
I wish I had thought of the cows thing.
That's good.

54:06.701 --> 54:11.163
Yeah, there was this one time,
we were really butting heads.

54:11.164 --> 54:13.976
Something about his brother.

54:14.793 --> 54:16.543
It's not important.

54:16.544 --> 54:20.005
But, anyway, it got to where
we weren't even hardly talking,

54:20.006 --> 54:24.695
and he asked me out on a date.

54:27.180 --> 54:28.347
A date?

54:28.348 --> 54:32.240
Yeah. Just like two kids in high school.

54:32.852 --> 54:36.855
He asked me out, we went out to dinner,

54:36.856 --> 54:40.234
we talked and it worked like magic.

54:40.235 --> 54:42.250
Very interesting.

54:42.279 --> 54:43.988
Well, speaking of work,

54:43.989 --> 54:46.532
I think we're probably
pretty much done here,

54:46.533 --> 54:52.428
so I'll talk to you later.

54:53.957 --> 54:55.874
Thanks for coming.
Just while we're standing here,

54:55.875 --> 54:57.167
I just want to point out a few things.

54:57.168 --> 55:00.765
This whole railing is brand-new,
and, actually, Doc built it himself.

55:01.256 --> 55:02.840
Fresh coat of paint.

55:02.841 --> 55:04.927
So I don't know if you guys
wanna... go inside,

55:04.928 --> 55:06.677
kinda get a lay of the land.

55:06.678 --> 55:10.115
- I'm staying with you.
- You're staying with me? Wow.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.992
I'm taking my boots off
and climbing.

55:11.993 --> 55:13.392
Listen, before you take
those boots off,

55:13.393 --> 55:15.477
do you wanna go look around
and see how big this yard is?

55:15.478 --> 55:17.062
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna be right back,

55:17.063 --> 55:19.064
'cause I'm gonna have
a very quick conversation with him.

55:19.065 --> 55:20.399
Oh, and you know that kitchen wall?

55:20.400 --> 55:22.234
Show them, it's not bearing,
so you can take it down.

55:22.235 --> 55:25.456
You can build
a gorgeous playroom for them.

55:26.239 --> 55:27.958
What's up?

55:28.074 --> 55:31.470
This may sound strange,
but, um...

55:33.079 --> 55:35.664
would you like to go
on a date with me?

55:35.665 --> 55:37.207
You know,
that does sound strange.

55:37.208 --> 55:40.419
It's been a while since we
dined together. And, uh... I...

55:40.420 --> 55:42.546
Well, we just had dinner in New York.

55:42.547 --> 55:45.341
And I thought that went well
until the murder.

55:45.342 --> 55:46.401
Hey, Meryl, you coming?

55:46.402 --> 55:48.927
Oh yeah. Just one minute.
I'll be in. Sorry.

55:48.928 --> 55:51.597
Shall we say 7:30?
Uh... it's a place called Annette's.

55:51.598 --> 55:55.616
I am told it is the only place
to eat in town. Literally.

55:55.852 --> 55:57.956
And... uh, it'll just be a chance
to sit and talk...

55:57.957 --> 56:00.856
like we used to,
before the infertility.

56:00.857 --> 56:04.499
And the infidelity.
And the separation.

56:06.696 --> 56:08.461
I will pay.

56:08.573 --> 56:11.385
Well, I mean, if you're gonna pay.

56:22.837 --> 56:25.464
Luckily, I called ahead
and got a table near the mayonnaise.

56:25.465 --> 56:26.799
You must know someone.

56:26.800 --> 56:28.967
And I know you said no more presents,

56:28.968 --> 56:31.553
but I went online,
under Emma's supervision,

56:31.554 --> 56:34.807
and downloaded a CD of New York noises
to help you sleep.

56:34.808 --> 56:38.102
Car horns, subways,
women fighting in Bloomingdale's.

56:38.103 --> 56:41.199
I think you might actually be on here.

56:41.981 --> 56:43.941
- Well, thank you.
- Very welcome.

56:43.942 --> 56:45.818
- Two salads.
- Thanks, Kelly.

56:45.819 --> 56:49.363
Actually, I had asked for mine
with the dressing on the side.

56:49.364 --> 56:51.448
I thought you were kidding.

56:51.449 --> 56:54.326
Yeah, I know, that always gets a laugh.

56:54.327 --> 56:55.911
Have you been a waitress
a long time, Kelly?

56:55.912 --> 56:57.329
Forever.

56:57.330 --> 57:00.958
I can't get by on nursing, there's just
not enough sick people in town.

57:00.959 --> 57:02.334
That's so unfair.

57:02.335 --> 57:05.587
It's not so bad. Most people in Ray
have two jobs. Some have three.

57:05.588 --> 57:08.900
- I'm also Assistant Fire Chief.
- Oh, really?

57:09.008 --> 57:11.907
Then... could you ask
the gentleman behind us...

57:11.908 --> 57:13.947
to please
put out his cigarette?

57:14.347 --> 57:17.850
Yeah, I can't do that.
That's Earl. He owns the place.

57:17.851 --> 57:21.728
- Well, why's it called Annette's?
- Annette was his wife.

57:21.729 --> 57:26.122
She divorced him about 10 years ago.
He doesn't want to repaint.

57:28.153 --> 57:29.872
Excuse me?

57:31.322 --> 57:34.992
Hi. I'm Meryl Foster. I'm Clay's cousin.

57:34.993 --> 57:38.245
And this is my husband, Paul.
We're visiting from Chicago.

57:38.246 --> 57:43.208
Howdy-do? I'm Earl Granger.
My granddaughter, Lucy.

57:43.209 --> 57:44.877
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

57:44.878 --> 57:47.337
I was just wondering,
would you mind terribly

57:47.338 --> 57:50.434
blowing the smoke
in another direction?

57:51.092 --> 57:52.811
Thank you.

57:54.679 --> 57:56.273
Chicago?

57:56.431 --> 58:00.184
I don't know how you do things
in Chicago, I never been there,

58:00.185 --> 58:03.372
but this is God-fearing
American country.

58:03.730 --> 58:08.123
We don't take kindly to outsiders
trying to tell us how to live.

58:08.276 --> 58:11.472
Well, people in Chicago
are just as American...

58:11.473 --> 58:13.572
and God-fearing
as people in Wyoming.

58:13.573 --> 58:17.010
I mean, not me, specifically.
I'm an agnostic.

58:17.494 --> 58:20.537
Next thing you'll be telling us
you're Democrats.

58:20.538 --> 58:23.582
Well, I mean,
there's gotta be a few of us in town.

58:23.583 --> 58:26.474
Fourteen. And we know who they are.

58:27.670 --> 58:29.640
Thirteen, honey.

58:30.006 --> 58:32.090
Bill Herr died a month ago.

58:32.091 --> 58:34.092
Of natural causes, or is he...

58:34.093 --> 58:38.065
You're not getting smart with me,
are you, tea-drinker?

58:38.223 --> 58:42.161
You know what I did to the last man
who called me that?

58:43.144 --> 58:45.330
I stole his crumpet.

58:48.316 --> 58:49.691
Doc.

58:49.692 --> 58:51.860
Howdy, Fosters. How are you tonight?

58:51.861 --> 58:55.253
Good. We just had
a lovely meal at Annette's.

58:55.740 --> 58:59.758
- Must be Earl's night off.
- Yeah.

59:02.664 --> 59:04.349
You okay?

59:05.375 --> 59:09.142
Well, we just need to call Clay and Emma.
They said they'd pick us up.

59:09.963 --> 59:13.382
They're playing poker
with the Millers and the Caseys.

59:13.383 --> 59:17.025
Here, just take my truck.
It's that one right there.

59:17.971 --> 59:20.191
We couldn't possibly.

59:21.224 --> 59:25.242
I don't need it till tomorrow.
Door's open, key's inside.

59:25.478 --> 59:27.038
Really?

59:27.313 --> 59:28.903
Yeah, around here,
everybody leaves their keys...

59:28.904 --> 59:30.483
in case someone needs a ride.

59:31.484 --> 59:34.125
- You don't do that in the city?
- Oh...

59:34.821 --> 59:37.197
Well, people do take
each other's cars, but...

59:37.198 --> 59:40.715
Yes, yeah, but the return policy's
a bit fuzzy.

59:41.286 --> 59:43.972
Well, you be sure
to return mine, alright?

59:43.973 --> 59:45.872
Okay, Doc, thanks.

59:45.873 --> 59:47.082
- Thank you.
- Good night, y'all.

59:47.083 --> 59:48.677
- Yeah.
- Night.

59:49.210 --> 59:51.158
Which one was it?

59:51.159 --> 59:53.558
I don't know.
They're all exactly the same.

59:58.261 --> 59:59.678
Are we lost?

59:59.679 --> 01:00:02.180
Certainly not.
I turned right at the broken fence.

01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:05.197
And left at the second big rock?

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.072
Second big rock?

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:13.525
Oh, no, then we are lost.
Alright, I'm gonna turn right up here.

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:16.747
No, I'm not.
I'm gonna go 'round. Hang on.

01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:24.508
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.890
Why her?

01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:34.004
You want to discuss this now?
In the middle of absolutely nowhere?

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:36.840
Yeah, I know
it's probably not the time, but...

01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:38.606
But why her?

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:40.901
I mean, you meet lots of women.

01:00:40.902 --> 01:00:43.741
You're always at lunches
and meetings, so,

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:48.909
why her? I mean,
was it just that she was pretty?

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:52.939
Who said she was pretty?
She was quite hideous, actually.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.317
A leper, really. I mean,
if the Elephant Man had a sister, she...

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.254
I googled her.

01:00:58.237 --> 01:01:01.754
Yeah, I just looked under
"loose legal ladies".

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.920
She's pretty.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:11.476
So, what's she like?

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:21.812
She's reserved. I don't know,
a bit cynical. You know.

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:25.653
Yeah, no, I can see that.
That makes sense.

01:01:26.265 --> 01:01:29.077
It was probably like, you know,

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:35.273
going to a spa, you know, very quiet

01:01:35.274 --> 01:01:38.193
and cool and laid back,

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:42.030
and nobody nagging you
or asking you questions

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:46.159
like some crazy, neurotic woodpecker

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.954
who won't let go of an issue
until it's been pecked to death. I know.

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:53.428
It was nothing. It was nothing.
It was really nothing. It was...

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:57.129
You know, I was stupid.
I'd had a few drinks.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.840
I was upset about us.

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:03.233
And it just happened,
and I did not enjoy it.

01:02:03.594 --> 01:02:09.114
I was feeling guilty the whole time, and
her perfume smelled a bit like a burrito.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:16.409
And you are, easily,

01:02:16.482 --> 01:02:19.359
the sexiest, most exciting woman

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.299
I have ever been with
or ever wish to be with.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:37.099
I sort of believe you.

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:42.726
Good.

01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.903
Progress.

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:53.954
Maybe it wasn't the fragrance.
Maybe she just smells like a burrito.

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:56.077
Very possible.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.974
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:24.730
Hi.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.062
- Hi.
- Morning, Lucy.

01:03:37.063 --> 01:03:38.623
Lucy.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.238
- Doc.
- Hey, Doc.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.254
Howdy, Fosters.

01:03:50.576 --> 01:03:53.672
It's a store. It's a real store.

01:03:56.415 --> 01:03:58.083
Of course they haven't got cashmere.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.961
And when they say they haven't,
don't just say, "Go and look. '"

01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:03.630
Sorry. You never know.
I mean, you just have...

01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:05.771
So you're a lawyer.

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:09.855
Sort of.

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:13.408
Well, this is about
my granddaughter, Lucy.

01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:16.907
She's gonna be the next American Idol.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:20.666
Is she? Well, that's great.
That's lovely. Good.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:25.500
See, her dad's sick,
and her mother's off to the Army.

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:30.251
So that leaves it up to old Grandpa
to look after her.

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.712
Truth is, I need a will.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:40.898
Okay, well, the problem is,
I don't really practice that kind of law.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:45.338
- What do you practice?
- No, no. He can do it. He can do it.

01:04:45.339 --> 01:04:46.506
Hey, listen, I gotta go.

01:04:46.507 --> 01:04:48.633
I told Doc that I would help him
with his house today, you know.

01:04:48.634 --> 01:04:53.277
So I'm just gonna go and shower,
and I'll see you later, and have fun.

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:58.537
I've got my financials
clear back to 1953.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:01.699
Good, great. That sounds fun.

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:04.983
Okay. Okay. Well, you know what?

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:09.969
Despite our cultural differences,
I think you and I could be good friends.

01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:13.050
Or not. It's completely up to you.

01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:25.187
I 18.

01:05:25.379 --> 01:05:27.589
- Do we have it?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:31.437
- Window shut.
- Excellent. Well done.

01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:35.566
We got N 3-2.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:38.910
N. N 32.

01:05:39.852 --> 01:05:43.164
- N 3-2.
- Hey, how'd it go today with Earl?

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:46.107
Really well. Yes. I made him such a
beautiful will, he asked me to kill him.

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.193
Well, look at you, country lawyer.

01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:50.236
Well, look at you.
Country real estate person.

01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:52.322
Word is that Doc had an offer
on his mum's house.

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:54.491
Yeah. She's incredible,
right out the gate.

01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:56.910
Well, it was just past the 2nd big rock,
and you know what they say,

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:58.411
location, location, location.

01:05:58.412 --> 01:06:02.896
Next up is B 4. B 4.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:10.442
That's so funny. "B 4," like "before".

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:15.022
Like "B dash 4 and after".

01:06:17.556 --> 01:06:19.808
Never a fire when you need one.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:23.395
G 46. That's G 4-6.

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:24.980
Oh, my God. Bingo!

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.827
- Bingo, bingo! Bingo!
- Oh, my God! Bingo!

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:30.917
Yes. Yes!

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:34.916
Come here.

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:36.950
Why are we so happy?

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:40.468
- We just won $15! That's three sweaters!
- Yes! Yes!

01:06:41.622 --> 01:06:44.916
Please listen to me.
You cannot call that number.

01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:47.127
We've been over this, Jackie.
You heard what the marshal said.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:50.213
We could be endangering their safety.
There are rules here.

01:06:50.214 --> 01:06:52.882
My God, you're a scared little man.

01:06:52.883 --> 01:06:56.480
Haven't you ever done anything
to break the rules?

01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:03.074
307-179-9048.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:09.357
Hello. It's Jackie Drake,
Mrs. Morgan's assistant.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.793
Adam!

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:18.533
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
I am so sorry. It was a reflex.

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:22.078
I took a self-defense course.
I got an A in Tasering.

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:24.470
Would you like to go to a movie
with me tomorrow?

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.736
- I don't know...
- Couldn't have enjoyed it more.

01:07:37.737 --> 01:07:39.380
- An exciting game.
- It was surprising.

01:07:39.381 --> 01:07:40.480
I was really surprised.

01:07:40.681 --> 01:07:42.098
- Congratulations.
- It was a great night.

01:07:42.099 --> 01:07:44.194
See you tomorrow.

01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:47.437
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:49.032
Night.

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:02.925
- Okay. I... Good night.
- Night.

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:31.537
Come in.

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.337
Hello.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.799
Hi. Are you asleep?

01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:42.533
Very much so, yes.

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:45.756
I hate to interrupt that,
but you have to see this.

01:08:48.874 --> 01:08:50.559
Good God.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.767
Is that right?

01:08:55.046 --> 01:08:56.937
I don't know.

01:08:58.466 --> 01:09:03.109
I've never seen anything like it
in New York outside the Planetarium.

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:10.326
"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:16.120
"L ove is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds

01:09:16.734 --> 01:09:19.751
"Or bends with the remover to remove

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:24.256
"O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark

01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:28.801
"That looks on tempests
and is never shaken"

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.477
It's Shakespeare, from our wedding.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:39.901
Was he there? We never got his gift.

01:09:41.093 --> 01:09:44.939
- It was my vows to you.
- I know. I know.

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:47.015
Although, at the time,
I thought you'd written them.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:50.112
I was so disappointed
when I found out.

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:53.657
Do you remember
your vows to me?

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:58.026
"There was once
a girl from Nantucket"

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.147
No, that's not it.
That's not it. That's not it.

01:09:59.148 --> 01:10:01.647
No, it's alright.
It was a long time ago.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:05.339
My God, it's amazing
how many stars.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:09.840
"I promise never to take you for granted

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:13.093
"Or utter a word unkind

01:10:13.959 --> 01:10:16.961
"Never allow my affections to be recanted

01:10:16.962 --> 01:10:19.853
"Or stop marveling at your behind

01:10:20.674 --> 01:10:24.612
"To also marvel at your warmth, your wit

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:28.056
"Your refusal to condone animal slaughter

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.869
"Your wisdom, your laugh

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.201
"Your inability to boil water

01:10:35.147 --> 01:10:38.149
"To be your best friend

"And to thank the God

01:10:40.986 --> 01:10:44.207
"For fooling you
into being my wife"

01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:57.252
And the next thing I heard was,

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.608
"Do you, Meryl Judith Becker,

01:10:58.609 --> 01:11:00.838
take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?"

01:11:00.839 --> 01:11:02.507
And I said, "I do".

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:04.592
You did, and then I heard,

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:08.429
"Do you, Paul Michael Morgan, take this
woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?"

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:10.306
And your mother said, "He doesn't! '"

01:11:10.307 --> 01:11:13.518
But I ignored her, and then I heard,
"I now pronounce you man and wife".

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:17.992
And then I don't remember.

01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:23.250
- "You may kiss the bride".
- Right, right. Right.

01:11:26.323 --> 01:11:28.866
- You may kiss the bride.
- Yes.

01:11:28.867 --> 01:11:33.727
And then we had the buffet, beginning
with the meatless pigs in blankets.

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:37.727
You may kiss the bride.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.099
May I?

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:49.971
You sure?

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.283
I'm wavering, honestly.

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:23.921
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:12:23.922 --> 01:12:26.643
Sorry, a bit out of practice.

01:12:26.967 --> 01:12:28.356
Ow!

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:31.693
What do you mean, "Ow"?
That was foreplay.

01:12:37.269 --> 01:12:39.364
Hey, Marshal Lasky.

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:41.870
Yes, sir.

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.412
Right. All right.

01:12:45.944 --> 01:12:47.663
Take care.

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.322
They got your separate sites ready,

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:51.741
and they want you to leave
tomorrow evening.

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:54.118
- Tomorrow?
- Yep.

01:12:54.119 --> 01:12:55.787
Wow. That soon, eh?

01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:59.760
Well, the good news
is you still get to go to the rodeo.

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:02.057
And the rodeo dance.

01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:04.522
Yes, yes.

01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:10.760
Dr. Simmons' office.

01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:13.805
Yeah, is this the Dr. Simmons
in Columbus, Ohio?

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:16.849
No, this is the Dr. Simmons
in Ray, Wyoming.

01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:19.161
Sorry, my mistake.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:25.994
There's someone using your name
in Columbus, Ohio.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.724
You know what?

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:46.087
I think that's about it for me.

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.630
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:13:47.631 --> 01:13:50.049
Well, I probably did tire you out
a bit last night.

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:52.236
God, I was amazing.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:55.847
Yeah, I'm really glad
I was there to see it.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:57.442
Yeah.

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:01.238
- All right.
- Wait, listen.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:04.908
With regard to the whole adoption thing,

01:14:05.023 --> 01:14:08.734
it is possible
that I did drag my feet a little bit.

01:14:08.735 --> 01:14:10.528
You would be a terrific mother,

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:13.531
caring, supportive
and completely smothering.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.658
I know! I'm so looking forward to that.

01:14:15.659 --> 01:14:19.051
But I am not sure
that I would be good at it.

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:21.205
Really? That's what you're worried about?

01:14:21.206 --> 01:14:23.426
A bit, yes, yes.

01:14:25.085 --> 01:14:27.879
What makes you think
I would be a good father?

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:32.273
Well, if I had to pick one thing,

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:36.137
I would say it was the mouse.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.889
What are you talking about?

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.224
Don't you remember? You know,
we had a mouse in our apartment,

01:14:40.225 --> 01:14:42.894
and then all of a sudden,
the cereal box started moving?

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:47.064
- Yes, yes. The shaky granola. Yes.
- Yeah. And it ran out to our balcony,

01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:49.734
and, you know, you could have just
taken a broom and swept it off,

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:52.098
but instead, you...
you stood there for hours...

01:14:52.099 --> 01:14:55.198
trying to coax that little guy
into a shoebox,

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.492
using Jarlsberg from Zabar's.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:58.636
Yeah, a terrible waste
of cheese,

01:14:58.637 --> 01:15:01.336
seeing as it eventually
leapt to its death, but...

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:04.892
And when I saw that,
I just...

01:15:07.252 --> 01:15:09.938
I knew you'd be a great father.

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:13.769
Especially if we adopt a rodent.

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:16.312
Thank you for being honest.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:20.556
Listen, while I am speaking honestly,

01:15:20.557 --> 01:15:23.309
I wondered if we might also discuss
the whole business of separate sites.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:24.894
- I don't want to pressure you...
- No, no.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:28.332
Actually, no,
I've been thinking about it, too.

01:15:29.107 --> 01:15:30.483
You know,
why don't you finish your jog,

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:33.956
and we'll talk about it
when you come back, okay?

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.249
Okay.

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:40.368
- Take the bear spray.
- Okay.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:43.681
- Take the bear flyer.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:15:55.759 --> 01:15:57.228
Clay?

01:15:57.678 --> 01:15:59.443
Come on in.

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:06.435
- Hey, Clay?
- Yeah?

01:16:06.436 --> 01:16:08.521
Hey, I was just looking for Emma
in the house.

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:10.982
Is she around?
I just wanted to talk to her.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:15.205
She's gone into Cody for supplies.
She'll be back in about an hour.

01:16:16.029 --> 01:16:17.321
It's just...

01:16:17.322 --> 01:16:21.534
As you can probably see, things are going
much better between me and Paul,

01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:26.330
but, you know, some very big decisions
need to be made in regards to our future,

01:16:26.331 --> 01:16:30.251
and the possibility
that we're not going back to New York,

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.711
and the fact is that,

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:35.855
well, I slept with someone else
while Paul and I were separated.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:39.070
Emma will be back in about an hour.

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:45.778
Well, I kind of don't know what to do.

01:16:46.226 --> 01:16:48.116
Grab a bucket.

01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:51.870
Okay.

01:16:59.197 --> 01:17:01.713
So which of these are skim?

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:08.766
Put your bucket under there.
Get that stool.

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:11.928
Grab a hold of a teat.

01:17:12.502 --> 01:17:14.221
Good luck.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:19.550
Well, you know, there's the school
of thought that says...

01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:21.052
what Paul doesn't know
won't hurt him,

01:17:21.053 --> 01:17:24.805
and on some level, I guess it's
almost narcissistic if I do tell him.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:27.394
But how can I expect
complete honesty from him...

01:17:27.395 --> 01:17:29.894
if I... if I'm asking any less
of myself?

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:32.813
I mean, isn't that just
the height of hypocrisy?

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:34.454
Could be.

01:17:36.276 --> 01:17:38.871
I don't hear much helping
going on over there.

01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:41.381
Sorry.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:45.132
Oh, God!

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:50.971
- Does this hurt them?
- Not if you're gentle about it.

01:17:55.128 --> 01:17:56.813
I get it.

01:17:58.048 --> 01:17:59.984
Yeah, I get it.

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:03.313
You're telling me to be honest...

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:05.513
but to be gentle.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.656
I was telling you
to ease up on her teat.

01:18:08.892 --> 01:18:11.578
But I guess it works both ways.

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:15.162
- That's very wise.
- I doubt that.

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:20.462
That stuff you're talking about
isn't easy.

01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:23.948
It's like that book, Men Are From Mars,
and Women Are From Venus.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:25.616
You read that book?

01:18:25.617 --> 01:18:29.134
I read the cover.
That pretty much summed it up.

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:41.517
Ringer!

01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:44.487
I give up, Clay. You're too good.

01:19:00.318 --> 01:19:03.209
Well, hello there. I'm glad you came.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.794
Thank you, Ray!

01:19:18.795 --> 01:19:23.313
Keep your dancing shoes on
'cause now we're gonna kick it.

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:25.520
- Come on, you're dancing.
- Really?

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.780
- I wanna tell you something.
- I know,

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:48.968
- I'm very light on my feet.
- No. Well, yes.

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:51.220
But something else.

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:57.101
I think we should go
to the official site together.

01:19:59.544 --> 01:20:01.354
You do?

01:20:02.547 --> 01:20:04.062
Yeah.

01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:08.511
- Well, that is so great.
- Good.

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:11.608
- That is so great!
- I know. I know.

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:28.628
And one other thing.

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.126
Yeah?

01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:32.910
While we were separated,

01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:35.097
I slept with someone else.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:39.101
Switch partners!

01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:01.536
It just happened once.

01:21:01.982 --> 01:21:03.497
Once.

01:21:03.942 --> 01:21:06.068
Really, and it was just because
I was just...

01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:10.587
I was feeling, you know,
just hurt and rejected.

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.202
- You're upset.
- No, no, no.

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:18.038
I'm... What am I?
I'm a little bit surprised, I suppose.

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:20.165
If you're gonna be mad, be mad,

01:21:20.166 --> 01:21:24.684
but please,
please don't stop talking to me.

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:28.799
Yell, scream, I don't care.
You know, honestly, whatever you want.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.634
There is nothing to scream about.

01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:35.495
We were separated. You're an adult.
These things happen, so there it is.

01:21:36.516 --> 01:21:38.611
- Hey, Paul.
- Howdy.

01:21:46.109 --> 01:21:49.046
- Do you wanna ask me something?
- No.

01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:05.058
- Do you mind?
- No, no, no, no.

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:19.391
Do you wanna talk?

01:22:19.392 --> 01:22:21.737
No, no. Unless you do.

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:24.407
I always wanna talk.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:27.122
Go ahead.

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:33.544
It's okay. Never mind.

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:01.767
Hey, folks, come on down to Ray Rodeo.

01:23:01.768 --> 01:23:03.644
Calf ropin', bull ridin',

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:06.787
pie-eating contest, great barbecue.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:23.303
Hey, excuse me.

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:26.306
- How you doing?
- Howdy.

01:23:26.459 --> 01:23:29.294
I'm looking for two friends of mine,
Paul and Meryl.

01:23:29.295 --> 01:23:31.310
Oh, the Fosters.

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:33.503
They're probably on their way
to the rodeo,

01:23:33.504 --> 01:23:35.843
but they're staying
with the Wheelers.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:38.220
Wheelers.
And where's that?

01:23:38.221 --> 01:23:41.765
Okay, so go down this road, and when
you see the broken fence, make a right.

01:23:41.766 --> 01:23:43.827
And then, when you come
to the second big rock...

01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:58.282
Morning.

01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:01.345
Better shake a leg if you want to eat.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:05.015
Do you know where Paul is?

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:08.010
Thank you.

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:20.898
Hey, can I ask you a question?

01:24:22.682 --> 01:24:25.142
Who do you think this is fooling?

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:27.033
Isn't this...

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:31.440
I mean, isn't this what screwed us up
in the first place, not talking?

01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:33.317
Is it? Is it really?
Sorry, it was stupid of me.

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:36.528
I thought it was sleeping with other
people, but maybe you're right. Yes.

01:24:36.529 --> 01:24:38.155
All right, you know what? Never mind.

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:39.823
All right. What would you like me to do?

01:24:39.824 --> 01:24:41.950
Would you like me to beg for information?
Then I will.

01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:44.467
- What was his name?
- Larry.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:46.887
Larry? Are you serious?

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.165
Larry.

01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:50.209
You know, he's recently divorced.
He just asked me to dinner.

01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:51.835
It's fine, it's fine,
I think I got the picture.

01:24:51.836 --> 01:24:53.253
And then you probably had a few drinks,

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:54.963
and you moaned
about your horrible husband,

01:24:54.964 --> 01:24:56.924
and then you went back to his apartment.
I got it. I got it.

01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:58.769
Well, no, no.

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:01.693
Went back to our apartment.

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:03.847
Right, we're selling the place.
Thanks so much for telling me.

01:25:03.848 --> 01:25:05.557
- Probably...
- You're upset.

01:25:05.558 --> 01:25:08.268
Look, we both made mistakes.

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:12.356
I made a mistake, yours seems
just a little bit more like revenge.

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:14.372
Are you serious?

01:25:15.693 --> 01:25:18.946
I mean, do you...
Do you not know me at all?

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:21.865
You think that I would sleep with someone
for revenge. I would...

01:25:21.866 --> 01:25:23.659
I would sleep with someone to hurt you?

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.619
Well, at this point,
I don't really know what I think of you.

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.663
- Oh, my God. Screw you.
- Can I just say this?

01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:29.790
- Meryl. Can I just... Can I speak?
- No. You know what? No.

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:32.209
- No. Not to me.
- Wait, Meryl, I'm not finished. Meryl!

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:33.335
Ready to go?

01:25:33.336 --> 01:25:35.879
I think I'm gonna pass
on the rodeo. Sorry.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:38.066
Yeah. Sorry, me, too.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.652
I have a lot of packing to do.

01:25:40.885 --> 01:25:42.445
Sorry.

01:25:43.012 --> 01:25:44.777
Okay, then.

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:49.115
Hold on.

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:55.042
I know it's none of my business,

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:58.110
but I've watched you two
over the past four days,

01:25:58.111 --> 01:26:03.096
laughing together
over your little inside New York jokes.

01:26:03.908 --> 01:26:06.299
I don't find them funny,

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:11.206
but I think that you can always tell
a lot about a couple

01:26:11.207 --> 01:26:14.929
by the fact that they still
laugh together.

01:26:17.922 --> 01:26:20.438
Thanks, I appreciate that.

01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:25.318
And, I think... Yeah, I think he's funny.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.741
He makes me laugh.

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:32.121
But if we're gonna stay together, then,

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:37.941
you know, I guess
we have to scale back our expectations,

01:26:37.942 --> 01:26:40.527
and I won't expect everything from him,

01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:42.738
and he won't expect everything
from me and...

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:46.131
You should expect everything
from each other!

01:26:46.409 --> 01:26:49.130
Marriage doesn't make any sense!

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:50.704
You gotta stop thinking about it,

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:54.427
and just get over
all the bullshit and make it work.

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:01.965
Look, I figured if she said something,
I was gonna...

01:27:01.966 --> 01:27:05.028
Oh, God. Come on, honey, let's just go.

01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:10.739
We'll pick you up
and take you to the airport.

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:13.320
I declare.

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:15.687
I have not heard you talk that much in...

01:27:15.688 --> 01:27:18.830
Well, I had to offer my two bits' worth.

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.410
Shit!

01:28:10.034 --> 01:28:11.952
- What was that?
- Oh, my God!

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:14.079
- Oh, my God, it's him!
- We gotta call Clay and Emma.

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.766
- No, no. The phone has a code.
- Christ!

01:28:27.051 --> 01:28:28.719
Excuse me.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:31.236
What are you, kidding?

01:28:42.066 --> 01:28:44.276
Oh, my God. I'm out of bullets.

01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:46.588
Something I never expected
to hear you say.

01:28:48.781 --> 01:28:51.627
We'll go out the back. Scuttle!

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:58.217
Come on. Up, up.

01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:01.435
- Come on, come on, come on.
- I'm trying.

01:29:03.796 --> 01:29:05.297
Okay, Windy, go.

01:29:05.298 --> 01:29:07.063
Oh, my God.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.903
Okay, we gotta find Clay.

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:30.169
Should be easy.
He's wearing a cowboy hat.

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:40.082
Nice try, cowboy.

01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:44.180
Been a while since anybody rode this bull
to the eight-second mark.

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:47.770
Looks like old Buster won another round.

01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:51.482
Dumped him
like a blushing bride at the altar.

01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:55.972
Doc Simmons and the boys
have a dangerous job,

01:29:55.973 --> 01:29:58.364
protecting these bull-riding cowboys.

01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:01.228
That's a lot of bull,

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:03.188
and that ain't no bull.

01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:05.204
Hey, that's Clay.

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:07.651
He's in the box. Go, go, go.

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:11.215
Folks, let's have a big hand
for our bull-fighting clowns.

01:30:18.788 --> 01:30:21.998
Folks, we got a little treat for you
today before our next bull.

01:30:21.999 --> 01:30:25.482
Here's hometown trick-rider Carly Ames.

01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:38.696
Oh, my God.

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:42.162
Just sit. Just sit.

01:30:52.071 --> 01:30:53.711
Scuttle.

01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:18.107
Nice riding, Carly. Thank you.

01:31:18.514 --> 01:31:21.451
Folks, let's give her a big hand.

01:31:22.393 --> 01:31:24.561
Next up is Tom willet.

01:31:24.562 --> 01:31:27.783
Tom's riding
the aptly-named bull, Killer.

01:31:29.525 --> 01:31:33.528
The last 3 cowboys to get on this bull
got dumped right out of the gate.

01:31:33.529 --> 01:31:37.012
Let's see if Tom can break that streak.

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:47.139
There he goes.

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:53.381
Go get him, boys.

01:31:53.382 --> 01:31:55.443
Let's go, come on!

01:31:57.053 --> 01:32:00.263
Old Killer's living up to his name today.

01:32:00.264 --> 01:32:02.529
What's happening? I can't see.

01:32:08.814 --> 01:32:10.624
Oh, my God.

01:32:12.944 --> 01:32:16.086
- What's that noise?
- Oh, God. Just run!

01:32:16.113 --> 01:32:19.676
- Just run!
- I'm running! I don't have a choice!

01:32:23.454 --> 01:32:26.540
- Meryl, you all right?
- No.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:29.251
- I really think I hurt my leg.
- Oh, God.

01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:31.938
I don't think I can walk.

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:34.798
Oh, my God.
We're never gonna get away from him.

01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:36.860
What? Where is he?

01:32:38.427 --> 01:32:39.970
Oh, God.

01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:42.806
Alright. Wait there. Wait there.
I'll be back in a minute.

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:46.226
Wait, what, what? Wait,
what're you doing? Where're you going?

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:50.245
- Please, don't leave me. Paul!
- Just keep your head down.

01:33:00.032 --> 01:33:01.157
Bollocks!

01:33:01.158 --> 01:33:04.925
Hey. I got plenty of room on my wall
for another head.

01:33:05.204 --> 01:33:08.415
Drop it, son.
Step back away from my lawyer.

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:10.917
I should just point out that
even if you kill me,

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:13.461
you now have two more witnesses
who will testify against you.

01:33:13.462 --> 01:33:15.422
- Three.
- Four.

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.215
- Five.
- Five.

01:33:17.216 --> 01:33:19.527
- You're six, Kell.
- Six.

01:33:34.483 --> 01:33:35.918
Oh, my God.

01:33:43.784 --> 01:33:45.535
You all right?

01:33:45.536 --> 01:33:48.538
Are you crazy?
You could have been killed.

01:33:48.539 --> 01:33:51.374
I am just very touched
that that would've bothered you.

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:53.835
Well, of course it would have.

01:33:53.836 --> 01:33:56.101
Oh, God, I had this...

01:33:56.339 --> 01:34:01.009
This horrible moment where I pictured
what life would be like without you.

01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:02.844
That's exactly what I had.

01:34:02.845 --> 01:34:05.347
When you were lying here,
sprawled in the dust,

01:34:05.348 --> 01:34:07.265
all I wanted to do was protect you.

01:34:07.266 --> 01:34:09.657
I lost all physical fear.

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:12.354
It's coming back now, though.
What in God's name was I thinking?

01:34:12.355 --> 01:34:14.731
I know exactly what you were thinking.

01:34:14.732 --> 01:34:17.901
You were thinking
that we're meant to be together,

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:20.070
because look what you did.

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:22.489
You risked your life for me.

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:24.366
That's so nice.

01:34:24.367 --> 01:34:26.451
- No.
- Sorry.

01:34:26.452 --> 01:34:29.138
No, no. I am sorry.

01:34:29.413 --> 01:34:33.852
I am so sorry
for nearly curing an incurable romantic.

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:37.087
I want you to expect everything from me.

01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:41.151
You're not gonna get it,
but I promise to try and give it.

01:34:41.425 --> 01:34:43.486
I love you, Meryl.

01:34:43.719 --> 01:34:46.846
If you are in fact Meryl.
I can't really see, I'm sorry.

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.987
I'm Meryl, trust me.

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:53.614
'Cause I trust you all over again.

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:14.541
Watch your head, please.

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:18.336
Goodbye, Lucy. I hope
I get to hear you on the radio soon.

01:35:18.337 --> 01:35:20.853
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:22.799
- Earl.
- Lucy.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.885
- Eat some meat.
- Eat some meat. Okay.

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:27.846
- Okay, good. Good.
- Take care.

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:29.931
Earl, I think we've become good friends.

01:35:29.932 --> 01:35:32.976
- Think what you want.
- Or not. Whatever.

01:35:32.977 --> 01:35:37.120
- So...
- I don't know what to say, except

01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:42.038
we are really, truly sorry about...

01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:43.987
- About everything.
- Yeah.

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:45.155
Don't be.

01:35:45.156 --> 01:35:48.700
The Feds are so happy with us,
they're letting Clay keep his job.

01:35:48.701 --> 01:35:50.702
Is that right? That's great news.

01:35:50.703 --> 01:35:53.549
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:55.665
Mr. and Mrs. Morgan, we're ready for you.

01:35:55.666 --> 01:35:58.887
Okay. Well, I suppose this is it.

01:35:59.128 --> 01:36:00.920
If we're ever attacked by a bear
in Central Park,

01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:02.714
we will be the only ones
who know what to do.

01:36:02.715 --> 01:36:06.482
You just take good care
of my favorite cousin, okay?

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:09.137
- Emma.
- Goodbye, Paul.

01:36:09.138 --> 01:36:12.974
Really, thank you for everything,
and remember my wood-chopping tips.

01:36:12.975 --> 01:36:16.186
- I'll never forget your wood-chopping.
- It's mainly wrist, it's less arm.

01:36:16.187 --> 01:36:20.284
Clay, I'm gonna hug you.
You won't like it, but I'm gonna hug you.

01:36:21.525 --> 01:36:23.818
Thank you.
And listen, if you're ever in New York...

01:36:23.819 --> 01:36:26.631
Something has gone terribly wrong.

01:36:28.574 --> 01:36:31.090
Okay. Well, let's go home.

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:33.338
- All right.
- Come on.

01:36:35.539 --> 01:36:37.600
How's your foot?

01:36:37.833 --> 01:36:40.710
Sheriff, your life just got
a whole lot simpler.

01:36:40.711 --> 01:36:42.647
So did yours, babe.

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.207
Isn't it amazing
that she slept the whole flight?

01:37:19.208 --> 01:37:20.416
Is that amazing?

01:37:20.417 --> 01:37:21.668
- Are they not meant to do that?
- Yes.

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:23.980
- Is she faulty?
- Faulty?

01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:27.298
No, she's perfect.

01:37:27.299 --> 01:37:29.008
Perfect, but nameless.

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:32.262
Well, perhaps we'll finally come up
with a name on the road home.

01:37:32.263 --> 01:37:35.014
She could be Midtown Tunnel Morgan.

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:36.599
59th Street Bridge Morgan.

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.893
Hey, there's Adam and Jackie. Hi.

01:37:38.894 --> 01:37:40.228
Get their bags.

01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:42.856
- Should I get a cart?
- You are the cart. Go.

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:44.326
Hey.

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:47.871
- Thank you, honey.
- You're my girl.

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:49.664
Go.

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:56.536
Hurry, get that.
Get the phone.

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:59.053
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.560
Hello?

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:05.103
Oh, hello, Adam,
I've missed you.

01:38:05.204 --> 01:38:07.007
Uh, no, no, I'm taking
the day off tomorrow,

01:38:07.008 --> 01:38:09.257
so you do not need to come in.

01:38:09.258 --> 01:38:11.148
Yes, I'm sure.

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:15.597
Well, in that case, have fun moving
Jackie's mother's furniture.

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:18.535
I see many happy years ahead of you.

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.446
Okay, bye.

01:38:22.313 --> 01:38:23.605
You know what I wish?

01:38:23.606 --> 01:38:27.400
I wish that as an older, wiser couple,

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:30.820
we could give them some advice
like Clay and Emma gave us.

01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:33.948
Or we could just send them
to Ray for the weekend.

01:38:33.949 --> 01:38:35.384
Rae.

01:38:37.202 --> 01:38:42.187
We'll call her Rae. R-A-E. Rae.

01:38:42.791 --> 01:38:46.149
I quite like that. I quite like that.

01:38:47.296 --> 01:38:49.005
- Do you like that?
- Yes.

01:38:49.006 --> 01:38:51.382
No, no, not you. You.
What are your thoughts?

01:38:51.383 --> 01:38:54.479
- Rae?
- Rae Morgan.

01:38:55.346 --> 01:38:59.140
Hey, this is our new apartment, Rae.

01:38:59.141 --> 01:39:00.350
It's the one we had to get...

01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:01.721
because I didn't want to stay
in the old one...

01:39:01.722 --> 01:39:04.054
after Mummy slept there
with Larry.

01:39:04.355 --> 01:39:06.564
She doesn't need to hear this.

01:39:06.565 --> 01:39:08.024
Now, listen.

01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:10.860
Come here, little girl. It's got...

01:39:10.861 --> 01:39:12.797
Come on.

01:39:12.821 --> 01:39:16.133
...3,000 square feet.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:20.745
And a very spacious master bedroom.

01:39:20.746 --> 01:39:24.934
And come see this view.
Come look at this view, little lady.

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:29.337
Right here, look at that.

01:39:29.338 --> 01:39:31.308
Can you believe?

01:39:31.548 --> 01:39:33.383
Is that something?

01:39:33.384 --> 01:39:35.445
It is, it is.

01:39:38.931 --> 01:39:41.617
That is quite a beautiful view.

01:39:43.769 --> 01:39:47.081
What? What?

01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:50.233
- How are you feeling, by the way?
- Good.

01:39:50.234 --> 01:39:53.080
- Everything all right?
- Very good.

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:56.166
It'll be funny if this one
comes out Chinese, as well.

01:43:08.932 --> 01:43:11.726
Hi. You've reached Meryl Morgan.
I can't take your call right now,

01:43:11.727 --> 01:43:14.948
so leave a message
and have a great day. Thanks.

01:43:20.777 --> 01:43:23.873
Meryl? Meryl? Meryl?

01:43:23.906 --> 01:43:25.671
Meryl? Meryl?

01:43:26.305 --> 01:43:32.198
