- Am I all packed, Gary?
- Yeah, we're all covered.

00:20.212 --> 00:23.180
The thing about Ohio is the weather
is completely schizophrenic.

00:23.181 --> 00:25.014
- I know.
- We dress you wrong,

00:25.015 --> 00:27.783
you're either freezing like a popsicle
or you're sweating like a hog.

00:27.784 --> 00:30.818
- Or a ballerina or modern dancer.
- Okay, it's fine.

00:30.819 --> 00:33.153
Is there an indoor pool at this place?
I packed my swimsuit.

00:33.154 --> 00:35.655
Why are you asking me that?
And have we heard from the president

00:35.656 --> 00:36.889
on the economic forum?

00:36.890 --> 00:39.059
Uh, yeah. Last I heard,
he was three over par.

00:39.060 --> 00:41.795
- Huh?
- Oh, forum's not happening.

00:41.796 --> 00:43.164
Potus took a golf day.

00:43.165 --> 00:44.498
Do you know who
he's playing golf with?

00:44.499 --> 00:47.167
- No, who?
- No, no, no, who?

00:47.168 --> 00:49.436
Oh, you don't know
and you want me to find out.

00:49.437 --> 00:51.605
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay. Sorry.

00:51.606 --> 00:54.375
- Dan. Dan Egan.
- Hey.

00:54.376 --> 00:56.343
Good to see you again, buddy.
I miss your emails.

00:56.344 --> 00:57.811
Long time no cc.

00:57.812 --> 00:58.979
Still up here
in Cleveland, huh, will?

00:58.980 --> 01:01.548
Just rutting around
with the regional swine?

01:01.549 --> 01:03.150
Slaving away for Furlong?

01:03.151 --> 01:04.718
Well, I am the senior
advisor now.

01:04.718 --> 01:07.453
So I get free wi-fi.
I'll be going to D.C.. A lot more.

01:07.454 --> 01:09.622
Oh, my God.
With that provincial sensibility

01:09.623 --> 01:11.623
and that girlish figure,
you're not gonna last.

01:11.624 --> 01:14.625
Listen, Dan, the congressman expects
your boss to endorse him for governor.

01:14.626 --> 01:16.360
Yeah, we're aware of that.

01:16.361 --> 01:17.762
It's gotten a bit
complex, all right?

01:17.763 --> 01:19.797
So the congressman would like
to speak with you in his room.

01:19.798 --> 01:22.099
<i>If you'd just join me, okay?</i>

01:24.737 --> 01:28.840
Ah, I recognize you. You're one of
Selina's little gay dwarves, aren't you?

01:28.841 --> 01:30.909
What, are you sappy?
Is that it? Preppy?

01:30.910 --> 01:32.577
Actually, my name is Dan Egan.

01:32.578 --> 01:35.513
You might remember, actually, I used
to work for congresswoman Hayes.

01:35.514 --> 01:37.482
Oh, my gosh, of course
I don't remember that.

01:37.483 --> 01:40.551
Listen, I need your help, buddy.
I need you to go back and tell Selina

01:40.552 --> 01:42.653
that I don't want her to
endorse me for governor, okay?

01:42.654 --> 01:44.855
<i>She's about as welcome here
as a turd in a hot tub.</i>

01:44.856 --> 01:48.891
Well, that could be
a bit of an issue.

01:48.892 --> 01:51.093
We're trying to run a
fundraiser and she's kind of

01:51.094 --> 01:53.329
toxic at the box office,
all right?

01:53.330 --> 01:56.364
We're having to bump our silver
plates up to gold plates,

01:56.365 --> 01:58.233
gold plates are going up
to platinum plates.

01:58.234 --> 02:00.569
I'd make more money
if I installed will here

02:00.570 --> 02:03.605
as a full-time gloryhole
greeter at a Georgetown gay bar.

02:03.606 --> 02:05.374
Which I'm pretty sure
he already does part-time.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.675
- Right, will?
- Yes, sir.

02:06.676 --> 02:08.009
Congressman, she's on her
way here right now.

02:08.011 --> 02:10.378
So what? There's plenty
to do here in Cleveland.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.114
Send her to the rock and roll
hall of fame.

02:12.115 --> 02:13.816
First time I took this kid,

02:13.817 --> 02:16.953
one look at Kurt Cobain's shoes, he
was bawling like a fucking baby.

02:16.954 --> 02:19.756
<i>"It's too soon!
It's too soon!"</i>

02:19.757 --> 02:23.926
Ma'am, Martin Collins, the secret
service guy we reassigned...

02:23.927 --> 02:26.362
- Mm-hmm.
- He's back. He's been un-reassigned.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.463
- Are you kidding me?
- Not great, admittedly.

02:28.464 --> 02:31.866
"Not great, admittedly"? Yeah, that
should be the title of my fucking memoir.

02:31.867 --> 02:34.969
He's not outside here, is he?
Oh, hi!

02:34.970 --> 02:37.571
Oh, my!
Okay, great.

02:37.572 --> 02:41.742
All right, that's all I want to say
to him for the rest of my life.

02:41.743 --> 02:43.977
Hey, approval ratings
just came through.

02:43.978 --> 02:46.113
- Oh.
- 66%.

02:46.114 --> 02:47.280
- What?
- Approve.

02:47.281 --> 02:49.349
- Oh!
- Sorry, disapprove.

02:49.350 --> 02:51.317
- Oh.
- Dis...

02:51.318 --> 02:54.820
You know what?
You go ride with the security detail.

02:54.821 --> 02:57.190
There's no room
for you in this car.

02:57.191 --> 02:58.859
<i>She can thank the troops,</i>

02:58.860 --> 03:00.493
<i>she can charm all
the mouth-breathers,</i>

03:00.494 --> 03:03.030
<i>and then she can go back to D.C.
No big deal.</i>

03:03.031 --> 03:05.032
<i>The one thing she will
not be doing</i>

03:05.033 --> 03:07.835
<i>is standing up and endorsing me.
You got me?</i>

03:07.836 --> 03:10.904
I get the stamp of
approval from her,

03:10.905 --> 03:13.140
and I might as well nail a
bunch of puppies to the ground

03:13.141 --> 03:16.476
and then start running them over and
crush their skulls with my campaign bus.

03:16.477 --> 03:19.012
All due respect,
we did have a...

03:19.013 --> 03:23.350
informal understanding that she would
endorse your run for governor.

03:23.351 --> 03:25.318
All right, well, all due
respect, cock nugget,

03:25.319 --> 03:26.853
there's been a little
too much of this

03:26.854 --> 03:29.321
informal understanding
going on around here.

03:29.322 --> 03:31.557
- Isn't that right, will?
- Yes, sir.

03:32.826 --> 03:35.327
Clean jobs was
your office, right?

03:35.328 --> 03:37.663
And its role in
the Macauley amendment.

03:37.664 --> 03:40.100
<i>Getting senator Macauley
to sneak in the VP's</i>

03:40.101 --> 03:43.036
lame-ass legislation
against the president's will.

03:43.037 --> 03:46.205
Macauley thing, yeah,
that didn't happen.

03:46.206 --> 03:48.108
Will, tell him who I am.

03:48.109 --> 03:49.943
Sir, you're the vice chair of the
congressional oversight committee.

03:49.944 --> 03:52.446
And in that capacity,
I have a duty to shine a light

03:52.447 --> 03:55.848
on any of this kind of backseat,
finger-fucking insider bullshit, Dan.

03:55.849 --> 03:57.550
Thank you for your time,
congressman.

03:57.551 --> 04:00.686
I will do what I can.

04:01.722 --> 04:03.623
Don't endorse.

04:05.125 --> 04:07.426
She seems nice.

04:09.529 --> 04:12.198
'Cause of that smiling
secret service guy, Amy,

04:12.199 --> 04:13.966
66% disapprove.

04:13.967 --> 04:16.334
That's everyone in America
who's awake right now.

04:16.336 --> 04:18.536
Okay, let's not
concentrate on that today.

04:18.538 --> 04:20.439
Let's concentrate on Ohio.

04:22.676 --> 04:25.412
<i>How could that many
Americans not like me?</i>

04:25.413 --> 04:28.549
I think they got it wrong. They counted
those numbers wrong or something.

04:28.550 --> 04:31.152
Or all those Americans
are completely wrong.

04:31.153 --> 04:34.122
Okay, this is the hotel manager.
We promised him four seconds.

04:34.123 --> 04:36.658
Madam Vice President.
Welcome to our hotel.

04:36.659 --> 04:39.194
We have to take the vice president away.
Apologies.

04:39.195 --> 04:41.763
Why have I been given
this pig's blood?

04:41.764 --> 04:44.934
It's tomato juice.
It's the Ohio state beverage.

04:44.935 --> 04:47.236
- Oh, piss. Ma'am.
- Yeah?

04:47.237 --> 04:49.906
They're having trouble
moving big donor tickets.

04:49.907 --> 04:51.107
- What?
- Yeah.

04:51.108 --> 04:52.842
- Why? Because of me?
- No.

04:52.843 --> 04:55.979
Amy, you're gonna have to start
getting everyone to like me.

04:55.980 --> 04:58.315
Ma'am. Hi.
Good news.

04:58.316 --> 05:00.951
We are not exactly selling that
many platinum level tickets.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.419
I just gave her that news.

05:02.420 --> 05:05.256
Yeah, but it was so much more
depressing coming out of you.

05:05.257 --> 05:07.959
Not to worry.
I have a strategy.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.895
Okay, look, we smile the
smiles, we shake the hands,

05:10.896 --> 05:14.399
but we do not endorse.
We give the press nothing to report.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.301
No, that makes me
look even weaker.

05:16.302 --> 05:18.503
- All right, ma'am, I...
- Hey.

05:18.504 --> 05:20.705
I really think this
is something to consider.

05:20.706 --> 05:22.874
Jonah.

05:22.875 --> 05:24.576
Greetings from
the clubhouse of power, Amy.

05:24.577 --> 05:26.744
You need to know that
the White House understands

05:26.745 --> 05:29.280
just how toxic the veep
is after these latest numbers.

05:29.281 --> 05:30.915
It's a tough time, we're aware.

05:30.916 --> 05:32.983
<i>Do you want to know
how toxic she is, Amy?</i>

05:32.984 --> 05:36.987
Imagine something small has
crawled up a dead cow's ass.

05:36.988 --> 05:40.024
And then that small thing
actually dies itself.

05:40.025 --> 05:43.495
If that dead thing then
farted out a sack of eggs,

05:43.496 --> 05:45.898
but each individual egg

05:45.899 --> 05:48.634
is a smaller,
rotting dead thing,

05:48.635 --> 05:50.603
<i>that's how toxic she is.</i>

05:50.604 --> 05:52.305
Okay, thanks for the input.

05:52.306 --> 05:54.441
And I know you're under a lot
of pressure over there,

05:54.442 --> 05:56.510
so if you ever need
a shoulder to cry on

05:56.511 --> 05:59.546
or a bootie to call on,
you have my number...

05:59.547 --> 06:04.251
Did you find out who the
president's playing golf with?

06:04.252 --> 06:07.287
Golf. You know, men walking
around with sticks

06:07.288 --> 06:09.322
- talking about their careers.
- Oh, mm.

06:09.323 --> 06:11.324
I was gonna follow up on that, ma'am.
I didn't forget.

06:11.325 --> 06:12.891
I did not forget.

06:12.892 --> 06:15.561
Ma'am, it's
congressman Furlong.

06:15.562 --> 06:18.296
- Well, you can tell him to go fuck him...
- He's right here, ma'am.

06:18.297 --> 06:20.466
- Oh! Roger.
- Madam Vice President.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.635
Thank you so much
for seeing me.

06:22.636 --> 06:24.804
Well, thank you
for dropping by.

06:24.805 --> 06:26.472
Excuse me while I get
myself pulled together.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.542
Of course. I like this room.
This is great.

06:28.543 --> 06:30.244
Yeah, it's
the presidential suite.

06:30.245 --> 06:32.847
Vice presidential, anyway.

06:32.848 --> 06:36.685
Listen, I've seen
the disapproval numbers.

06:36.686 --> 06:39.622
So I appreciate the delicate
situation here.

06:39.623 --> 06:42.425
Uh, just part of the job.

06:42.426 --> 06:44.194
No, it's not.
This is Will.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.829
Will, what were they saying
about the disapproval?

06:45.830 --> 06:48.999
Apologies, ma'am.
"Effed in the b-hole" across all networks.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.802
Ma'am, that is a lingering image
to try to overcome, I'll tell you.

06:51.803 --> 06:53.504
What's this about, congressman?

06:53.505 --> 06:56.607
Well, I was hoping maybe,
ma'am, we could have a moment.

06:56.608 --> 06:59.910
- Yes. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

06:59.911 --> 07:03.446
Ma'am, I don't want you to endorse
my run for governor at this time.

07:06.350 --> 07:08.952
<i>Um, well, Roger,</i>

07:08.953 --> 07:12.389
- that is difficult...
- Mm-hmm.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.959
For me because I'm here.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.895
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's great.
Can I get some water?

07:18.896 --> 07:20.196
Um, it's being put to me...

07:20.197 --> 07:22.732
<i>- Gary, can I get some water?
- Yeah.</i>

07:22.733 --> 07:25.836
It's being put to me
that... and I apologize...

07:25.837 --> 07:29.372
but politically speaking,
you are damaged goods.

07:29.373 --> 07:31.374
I'm hearing that
your credibility is...

07:31.375 --> 07:32.909
- Where is it located, will?
- The toilet.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.779
Mm-hmm.
Again, not my words.

07:35.780 --> 07:38.481
- So...
- The toilet?

07:38.482 --> 07:41.017
- I don't want this.
- Okay.

07:41.018 --> 07:43.686
- More accurately, the crapper.
- Who are you?

07:43.687 --> 07:46.456
- Who is this fucking infant?
- No one.

07:46.457 --> 07:50.393
Let me be very clear with you
about something, okay, Roger?

07:50.394 --> 07:53.230
I don't even like you.

07:53.231 --> 07:54.798
- Right.
- Right?

07:54.799 --> 07:59.402
And now I'm, you know, been told
to come here and endorse you.

07:59.403 --> 08:01.271
So do you understand
how embarrassing

08:01.272 --> 08:03.172
this would be for me
now not to endorse you?

08:03.173 --> 08:04.674
Yes, of course.
I get it, yeah.

08:04.675 --> 08:07.643
And listen, in the spirit
of reciprocity, ma'am,

08:07.644 --> 08:10.513
I don't really care for
you much either personally.

08:10.514 --> 08:13.049
You can't stop me
from endorsing you.

08:13.050 --> 08:15.952
Then I will reject
the endorsement publically.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.520
Madam Vice President,
do you need five minutes?

08:17.521 --> 08:19.021
No, I don't need five minutes.

08:19.022 --> 08:20.890
I'm absolutely fucking fine.

08:20.891 --> 08:23.792
Thank you very much.

08:23.793 --> 08:27.663
You know, Roger, do you
sometimes think about,

08:27.664 --> 08:30.666
I don't know, I give you
this and you give me that

08:30.667 --> 08:33.602
and black is up,
but brown is down now?

08:33.602 --> 08:35.304
- Do you know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

08:35.304 --> 08:40.308
I mean, in life
or even just with love,

08:40.309 --> 08:43.645
you know, I mean,
at the end of the day,

08:43.645 --> 08:47.649
you know, aren't we just all
finally just, you know, people?

08:47.650 --> 08:49.985
- True words, ma'am.
- Yeah.

08:51.287 --> 08:52.687
I mean, you know, I haven't...

08:52.688 --> 08:55.156
I haven't seen my...
my daughter

08:55.157 --> 08:57.391
in, like, three months.

08:57.392 --> 09:00.127
And Ted is just,
you know, whaa!

09:00.128 --> 09:02.563
I don't know where
he went, you know?

09:02.564 --> 09:04.531
You know, and I would...

09:04.532 --> 09:07.300
I would love to go
to that party, you know?

09:07.301 --> 09:11.338
I would like to be everywhere.

09:13.607 --> 09:16.743
Look, Madam Vice President,
I'm sorry.

09:16.744 --> 09:18.812
This doesn't give me
any pleasure.

09:18.813 --> 09:20.648
Don't you say
it gives you no pleasure.

09:20.649 --> 09:21.982
When anybody ever says that,

09:21.983 --> 09:23.984
all they mean is that it does
give them so much pleasure.

09:23.985 --> 09:26.220
- Look...
- I know what that means.

09:26.221 --> 09:28.189
Maybe you should make
an address, okay?

09:28.190 --> 09:31.126
Talk about politics
and America working together.

09:31.127 --> 09:33.528
I know how to give
a motherfucking speech.

09:33.529 --> 09:36.732
Don't you patronize me
with your no jaw.

09:36.733 --> 09:38.934
You congressman no jaw.

09:38.935 --> 09:41.403
Okay, ma'am.
We should... we have to go.

09:41.404 --> 09:43.572
- Get the fuck out.
- Okay. Okay.

09:48.745 --> 09:50.678
He was just not a nice man.

09:50.679 --> 09:52.681
I'll get you some tea, okay?

09:52.682 --> 09:56.050
I'll just leave Mike.
He can stay here with you.

10:01.790 --> 10:04.658
- I'm sorry about your tears.
- Yeah.

10:04.659 --> 10:06.060
They suck.

10:06.061 --> 10:08.062
You know, my papaw used to say,

10:08.063 --> 10:11.165
"it's always darkest
before the storm." So...

10:11.166 --> 10:13.935
Oh, the dawn, the dawn.

10:13.936 --> 10:18.105
"It's always darkest before the
dawn." And then he would kiss me.

10:19.541 --> 10:21.741
All right, this might sound
crazy, but go with it.

10:21.742 --> 10:24.878
Her crying was very authentic

10:24.879 --> 10:27.280
and humanizing.

10:27.281 --> 10:29.616
Okay.

10:29.617 --> 10:31.618
I like your thinking.

10:31.619 --> 10:33.620
I actually found it
slightly erotic, too.

10:33.621 --> 10:35.155
I take it back.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.157
That's why it took me so long
to split up with Angie.

10:37.158 --> 10:39.092
She'd always cry,
I'd always get a hard-on.

10:39.093 --> 10:41.061
- Now you've lost me.
- Listen.

10:41.062 --> 10:42.963
We should spitball
on this, though.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.000
The crying game play,
all right?

10:47.001 --> 10:50.538
All we've got to do is set her
up and let the cameras roll.

10:50.539 --> 10:52.173
Then we've just got to tweak
the tear nipple.

10:52.174 --> 10:54.275
How do we make it happen?

10:54.276 --> 10:57.645
Could spray her
with pepper spray.

10:57.646 --> 11:00.247
Call her fat.
Kidding.

11:01.749 --> 11:03.917
What is it that made her cry?

11:03.918 --> 11:05.852
It's Catherine, right?

11:05.853 --> 11:07.587
The absent mother blubber.

11:07.588 --> 11:09.122
- Genius.
- Yeah.

11:09.123 --> 11:11.023
Chinese daughter torture.
It's a good one.

11:11.024 --> 11:12.858
I can't believe
we're doing this.

11:12.859 --> 11:15.828
On the other hand, we are currently
polling lower than a side of beef

11:15.829 --> 11:17.897
with eyes drawn on it, so...

11:17.898 --> 11:20.032
<i>- Okay, ma'am, light and frothy.
- Yeah.</i>

11:20.033 --> 11:22.802
Cappuccino politics, okay?
Big three industries in Ohio...

11:22.803 --> 11:25.671
- Rubber, petrochemical, agriculture.
- Right. Okay.

11:25.672 --> 11:28.942
- Hit rubber. It's a big rubber state.
- Okay. Good. Yeah.

11:30.612 --> 11:33.647
What is that, a fax?
Is that a message to yourself from 1988?

11:33.648 --> 11:35.616
Look who's playing golf
with the president.

11:35.617 --> 11:37.718
Danny Chung.

11:37.719 --> 11:39.253
- Chung.
- Shut up.

11:39.254 --> 11:41.255
- What is that?
- Don't worry about it.

11:41.256 --> 11:44.290
Felicia, one second. Feel free to
dive right in on the daughter, okay?

11:44.291 --> 11:46.459
'Cause we want to hit these
disapproval ratings head on.

11:46.460 --> 11:49.328
See, when he says things like
that to me, it makes me anxious.

11:49.329 --> 11:52.631
We just found out that governor
Chung is golfing with potus.

11:52.632 --> 11:54.633
- So, if you want to talk about that...
- All right.

11:54.634 --> 11:55.633
Thank you so much.

11:55.634 --> 11:59.004
It is just great to be back
in the state of Ohio.

11:59.005 --> 12:00.406
Been a rough couple of
months for you, though.

12:00.407 --> 12:02.575
Your filibuster reform stalled.

12:02.576 --> 12:05.311
Clean jobs initiative,
dead in the water.

12:05.312 --> 12:08.048
You talk a lot about really wanting
to be able to make change.

12:08.049 --> 12:10.083
Do you still think you're gonna
be able to make that happen?

12:10.084 --> 12:12.252
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, I'm very proud

12:12.253 --> 12:15.089
of what we've been
able to achieve thus far.

12:15.090 --> 12:16.657
So you feel
you're back in the game?

12:16.658 --> 12:19.393
Well, it's not a game to me.

12:19.394 --> 12:22.763
Must be very hurtful to you, too,
with all the gossip going around.

12:22.764 --> 12:25.665
Is she gonna go?
I just understand today

12:25.666 --> 12:28.301
that the president is golfing
with governor Chung.

12:28.302 --> 12:30.470
Does that bother you?

12:30.471 --> 12:32.972
Well, I mean, the president

12:32.973 --> 12:36.876
can play golf
with whoever he likes.

12:36.877 --> 12:39.244
<i>But I'm here
because I have work to do.</i>

12:39.245 --> 12:41.647
It's 24/7.
It's a public duty.

12:41.648 --> 12:44.282
24/7 doesn't leave you
much time for your family,

12:44.283 --> 12:45.851
your daughter.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.887
Well, I mean, it's a punishing
schedule, that's for sure.

12:48.888 --> 12:50.789
I mean, you get...
you get tired

12:50.790 --> 12:53.525
and you get knocked...
knocked back.

12:53.526 --> 12:56.328
But...

12:56.329 --> 12:59.297
Can you imagine, Felicia,

12:59.298 --> 13:01.533
if I'm tired,

13:01.534 --> 13:06.405
imagine how tired the rubber
makers are here in Ohio.

13:06.406 --> 13:08.407
She is magnificent.

13:08.408 --> 13:12.245
Making rubber day in
and day out.

13:12.246 --> 13:17.183
I feel that Ohio is
the rubber ball state,

13:17.184 --> 13:19.484
if you think about it.

13:19.485 --> 13:21.654
Always bouncing back.

13:25.925 --> 13:27.292
I don't know what the hell
she could have been thinking.

13:27.293 --> 13:29.428
When was the last time
you cried twice in one day?

13:29.429 --> 13:31.997
It was a little more
recently than you'd think.

13:31.998 --> 13:34.000
<i>Oddjob.</i>

13:34.001 --> 13:36.502
Come here.
What the fuck gives with your boss?

13:36.503 --> 13:37.737
I saw the meltdown.

13:37.738 --> 13:41.052
Congressman, I saw passion.
I saw conviction.

13:41.053 --> 13:42.915
I saw a fucking crazy lady.
That's what I saw.

13:42.916 --> 13:46.079
If she mentions my name,
if I get the stamp of approval,

13:46.080 --> 13:48.849
the midas touch from Jenny
shitfinger, I'm coming for you, pal.

13:48.850 --> 13:51.285
Me and the congress of the
United States will get your ass.

13:51.286 --> 13:52.586
Yes, sir.

13:52.587 --> 13:55.723
Ask your buddy Macauley about it.
Maybe he can help you.

13:55.724 --> 13:56.958
<i>The vice president.</i>

13:56.959 --> 14:00.294
Hello! Yes.
I see you.

14:00.295 --> 14:02.797
Oh, wow, look at this group.

14:02.798 --> 14:05.566
Are they gonna live long enough
to make it to election day,

14:05.567 --> 14:07.334
right behind me?
Probably not.

14:07.335 --> 14:09.903
Hello, children
who do not vote.

14:09.904 --> 14:13.073
We're getting great media
response to the interview.

14:13.074 --> 14:14.775
- Are you getting this, too?
- No, better.

14:14.776 --> 14:16.677
I've been polling the room.
It's warm, it's friendly.

14:16.678 --> 14:18.612
If this plays in Ohio,
it's gonna go national.

14:18.613 --> 14:19.947
Come on, Amy.

14:19.948 --> 14:22.283
- Marcus.
- What?

14:22.284 --> 14:24.085
I made you a cake
with your face on it.

14:24.086 --> 14:26.287
Are you kidding me?
Oh!

14:26.288 --> 14:28.389
That looks like me after
a long day in the Senate.

14:28.390 --> 14:31.325
I think she's only paid 50 bucks.

14:31.326 --> 14:32.993
I have to go.

14:32.994 --> 14:34.728
- Madam Vice President.
- Yes?

14:34.729 --> 14:36.864
I'd like to introduce you to one
of our actual platinum donors.

14:36.865 --> 14:40.033
I have some great ideas about tax
reform I want to talk to you about.

14:40.034 --> 14:42.769
- I want to hear them.
- Well, there's two types of people.

14:42.770 --> 14:45.139
- Uh-huh.
- Okay? You got grabbers.

14:45.140 --> 14:46.973
And then you have
the other kind.

14:46.974 --> 14:49.042
I don't have a name for that.
The ones who don't grab.

14:49.043 --> 14:51.477
- Oh.
- The grabbers, right,

14:51.478 --> 14:53.712
- they take the world by the scrotum, okay?
- Oh.

14:53.713 --> 14:56.482
- And they make it happen.
- This is just riveting stuff.

14:56.483 --> 14:59.819
- Oh, I'm so sorry. So sorry.
- Yes?

14:59.820 --> 15:02.356
I don't know what to say, so
I'm just whispering instead.

15:02.357 --> 15:04.358
Oh, I have the...

15:04.359 --> 15:07.161
- Middle east.
- You can talk later.

15:07.162 --> 15:10.432
- We have all night.
- I appreciate that. Hello. Uh-huh.

15:10.433 --> 15:12.200
I just want to eat
in a quiet corner

15:12.201 --> 15:14.269
away from these bozos, okay?

15:14.270 --> 15:16.805
And that's the essence
of a grabber.

15:16.806 --> 15:19.441
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

15:19.442 --> 15:22.077
You'd think with all the money
I'm jerking up the wall here,

15:22.078 --> 15:23.679
I'd get more than
a stuffed chicken breast.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.581
Right, well, you know,
I've got to tell you,

15:25.582 --> 15:27.716
these caterers, they've got...

15:27.717 --> 15:29.417
I gave 30,000 bucks,
I get a chicken breast.

15:29.418 --> 15:31.553
That guy didn't give 500 bucks,
he's got a chicken breast.

15:31.554 --> 15:33.521
<i>- What do I get, stuffing?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

15:33.522 --> 15:36.324
<i>- Okay.
- Throw me a drumstick or something.</i>

15:36.325 --> 15:38.293
- Larry.
- Hey.

15:38.294 --> 15:41.163
- It's good to see you.
- Why, you need a lawyer?

15:42.698 --> 15:44.466
All right, look.
Listen.

15:44.467 --> 15:48.571
I may have gotten involved
in a little something.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.775
What happens if I get called in
before a congressional committee?

15:51.776 --> 15:54.111
Okay, you need three
versions of your statement.

15:54.112 --> 15:56.847
Uh-huh, like what I say happened, what
they say happened, and the truth?

15:56.848 --> 15:58.749
Right?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.285
A written, an oral,
and a shorter oral

16:01.286 --> 16:03.120
- in case of a time limit.
- Right.

16:03.121 --> 16:05.589
Yeah, you want to tell a congressional
committee the truth, Dan.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.125
Anything out of line, you're
looking at a perjury charge.

16:08.126 --> 16:09.647
Fuck!

16:09.648 --> 16:11.462
Don't call attention to yourself,
all right?

16:11.463 --> 16:14.198
Just lay low,
keep your head down.

16:14.199 --> 16:17.869
All right, now let's say
this does actually happen

16:17.870 --> 16:21.372
and I get called in,
what's it like up there?

16:21.373 --> 16:24.742
You know those dreams where your
football coach is screaming at you,

16:24.743 --> 16:28.379
you look down, you're dressed like Shirley
Temple and then all your teeth fall out?

16:28.380 --> 16:31.082
That's like a Disney version
of a congressional committee.

16:31.083 --> 16:34.118
You're gonna get hometown,
downtown questions.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.887
You'll catch partisan shit.
There's gonna be grandstanding.

16:36.888 --> 16:40.458
And if they smell blood,
if they think you're going down

16:40.459 --> 16:41.859
and there's gonna be a kill,

16:41.860 --> 16:44.196
you might get what
we call corpse fucking.

16:44.197 --> 16:47.032
Jesus.
Corpse fucking?

16:47.033 --> 16:49.067
That's what it's called where
they take your mortal remains

16:49.068 --> 16:50.869
and have as much fun
with it as they can.

16:50.870 --> 16:54.206
'Cause everybody wants to be the guy
getting the TV sound bite, okay?

16:54.207 --> 16:55.607
And they're gonna be
talking about you.

16:55.608 --> 16:56.709
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:58.745 --> 17:00.846
Thank you so much.

17:00.847 --> 17:04.550
Thank you so, so, very, very much.
Good evening, everyone.

17:04.550 --> 17:06.452
What are you doing?

17:06.453 --> 17:08.487
Sir, this crying
is tracking pretty well.

17:08.488 --> 17:10.222
What?

17:10.223 --> 17:12.491
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, it's good.

17:12.492 --> 17:13.892
Okay, that changes everything.

17:13.893 --> 17:15.926
She's someone I know
you know very well.

17:15.928 --> 17:17.863
- Hey, come here.
- Relax, okay?

17:17.864 --> 17:19.196
I spoke to her.
You spoke to her.

17:19.198 --> 17:20.397
She's not gonna
fucking endorse.

17:20.398 --> 17:22.166
No, no, no.
We want her to endorse now.

17:22.167 --> 17:24.035
Okay? She's gone from
toxic to turn-on.

17:24.036 --> 17:26.404
So just... when we give you the nod,
give her the signal, all right?

17:26.405 --> 17:28.406
You guys are burning a fucking
hole through my stomach.

17:28.406 --> 17:30.375
I just spent all afternoon
fixing this for you.

17:30.376 --> 17:33.111
- Now you want me to unfix it?
- Is this your first day in the game?

17:33.112 --> 17:34.779
I think he's wrapping up, so...

17:34.780 --> 17:36.414
- Okay.
- How you feeling?

17:36.415 --> 17:40.117
Well, I'm a political leper,
and I'm an emotional time bomb.

17:40.118 --> 17:42.953
So here's an idea...
let's put me onstage.

17:42.954 --> 17:45.756
Selina Meyer.

17:49.660 --> 17:53.262
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much.

17:53.263 --> 17:55.798
So wonderful.
Thank you.

17:55.799 --> 17:58.901
Please be seated. Thank you so much.
It is my very...

17:58.902 --> 18:00.370
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Give her the signal.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.039
What the fuck is the signal?

18:02.040 --> 18:03.874
There's no international
signal to endorse.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.377
Use your fucking head.
Give her a thumbs up or something.

18:06.378 --> 18:09.080
Oh, my goodness.
Well, this has been

18:09.081 --> 18:11.784
quite the day, hasn't it?

18:11.785 --> 18:15.688
<i>We love you!</i>

18:15.689 --> 18:17.123
Thank you very much.

18:17.124 --> 18:18.624
She can't cry
three times in a day.

18:18.625 --> 18:19.992
That's three strikes
and you're out.

18:19.993 --> 18:21.828
How big are her tear ducts?

18:21.829 --> 18:23.129
It's like
they're fucking tidal.

18:23.130 --> 18:25.231
Such a happy occasion, and...

18:28.436 --> 18:31.405
Jesus Christ.
Fuck it, don't endorse.

18:31.406 --> 18:34.808
I'm so glad to be here in
the 17th state of the union.

18:34.809 --> 18:38.311
My grandfather, he was from
Cincinnati, as a matter of fact.

18:38.312 --> 18:41.014
Oh.

18:42.917 --> 18:44.952
We used to have
a saying in our family.

18:44.953 --> 18:48.022
We used to say we're
awfully embarrassed

18:48.023 --> 18:50.525
by our buckteeth.

18:50.526 --> 18:53.762
But we were mighty proud
of our buckeyes.

18:57.001 --> 18:59.335
Okay, endorse.
Endorse. Endorse.

18:59.336 --> 19:01.470
- You're sure?
- Endorse. Yes.

19:01.471 --> 19:03.806
I, um...

19:03.807 --> 19:06.375
I still miss my grandpa.

19:06.376 --> 19:08.244
What is that, Popeye?

19:08.245 --> 19:10.480
<i>- No, be strong.
- He was the best.</i>

19:10.481 --> 19:14.317
He was...
he was such a strong man

19:14.318 --> 19:17.755
<i>from a great state.</i>

19:17.756 --> 19:21.058
<i>And so that's why
I've come here today.</i>

19:21.059 --> 19:24.829
I've come here today

19:24.830 --> 19:28.367
to give my 100% support

19:28.368 --> 19:32.605
to congressman Roger Furlong

19:32.606 --> 19:35.909
to be the next, the best,

19:35.910 --> 19:39.145
governor of Ohio.

19:39.146 --> 19:40.980
That's right.

19:40.981 --> 19:44.183
<i>That's you.
Come on up here.</i>

19:46.552 --> 19:48.253
What the hell just happened?

19:48.254 --> 19:50.755
So great to be part
of your feel-good moment.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.390
You're a dirty little prick.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.926
Oh, boy.
Thank you so much.

19:55.927 --> 19:58.029
- Absolutely.
- Oh, boy.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.530
Don't forget your booster seat.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.432
Oh, shove it up your ass.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.568
- Thanks so much.
- Okay.

20:04.569 --> 20:07.605
Hey, that photographer
who reads lips,

20:07.606 --> 20:09.340
- he's not here, is he?
- Mm-mmm.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.175
No.
That's a blessing.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.311
Did you see
the "Chicago Tribune"?

20:13.312 --> 20:15.746
Oh, this is so great.
I've never enjoyed reading this much.

20:15.747 --> 20:18.216
You know, my mom said that Selina
looked human and vulnerable.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.385
- Great.
- Not a compliment.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.320
She sees human vulnerability
as a weakness.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.589
- I like your mom.
- Don't talk about my mother, Dan.

20:24.590 --> 20:28.326
- Good morning!
- Did you see the "Chicago Tribune"?

20:28.327 --> 20:30.562
I've seen it, I've read it,
I've eaten it,

20:30.563 --> 20:33.798
I've showered in it.
I'm back, my babies.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.768
Yeah, you are.
Like rubber Jesus.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.769
And, Dan, get over here
and shake my hand.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.106
- What a great job you did.
- My pleasure.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.675
Seriously, getting me
to endorse Furlong.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.310
How about that
round of applause?

20:45.311 --> 20:47.078
Come on, guys.
Give it up for him.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.013
Absolutely great.

20:49.014 --> 20:51.183
You know none of these
people generally like you.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.818
So fucking what?

20:52.819 --> 20:54.853
Hey, everyone.
Oh, hey!

20:54.854 --> 20:57.555
Hey, it's about time.
Thank you.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.457
Hey, Mike.

20:59.458 --> 21:02.928
Potus is so excited about
this new narrative.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.129
I engineered Selina
crying on camera.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.699
I'm the puppet master.
I'm Pinocchio.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.268
Pinocchio wasn't the puppet master, Mike.
He was the puppet.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.570
- Uh, yeah, he was.
- Five-year-olds get that.

21:12.571 --> 21:16.474
Jonah, do you come bearing news
from the gentleman's club?

21:16.475 --> 21:18.610
I come bearing a message
of support from the president.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.845
- Oh.
- As you know, he called.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.648
Sue, did the president call?

21:22.649 --> 21:24.516
- No.
- Huh.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.218
Well, it wasn't an actual call.

21:26.219 --> 21:28.120
- I am here in lieu of that call.
- Uh-huh.

21:28.121 --> 21:31.123
- But he and we are...
- I have a very big announcement to make.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.859
I'd like everyone to follow
me into my office, please.

21:33.860 --> 21:37.497
This-a-way.
Okay, so I am about to announce

21:37.498 --> 21:39.566
a certain realignment.

21:39.567 --> 21:42.469
Oh, Mike.
I am sorry for your loss.

21:42.470 --> 21:44.805
Dan, you're getting
a promotion.

21:44.806 --> 21:46.941
Wow.
Yeah!

21:46.942 --> 21:48.944
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

21:48.945 --> 21:51.447
I just signed for an auto lease.
If I could get six months...

21:51.448 --> 21:54.583
I want you to be in charge of
day-to-day rebuttal for me, all right?

21:54.584 --> 21:57.921
You'll be the new director
of policy and presentation.

21:57.922 --> 22:01.090
Thank you, ma'am.
This is all I've ever wanted.

22:01.091 --> 22:02.358
This is all I've never wanted.

22:02.359 --> 22:04.427
Is he...
is Dan my boss now?

22:04.428 --> 22:06.529
Can I just say that this
is really exciting to watch?

22:06.530 --> 22:09.032
I guess I've got some
business to attend to.

22:09.033 --> 22:11.801
- What business?
- That's a need-to-know basis, Mike,

22:11.802 --> 22:13.136
and you don't
have the clearance.

22:13.137 --> 22:15.772
Funny.
Is that true?

22:15.773 --> 22:17.707
This is sad.
You're like an old panda

22:17.708 --> 22:19.776
that's gonna get
put down at the zoo.

22:19.777 --> 22:22.511
- They bring kids in to watch that.
- Fuck off.

22:22.512 --> 22:25.480
I'm assuming I'm safe.

22:25.481 --> 22:27.215
Amy, you pretended to have
a miscarriage for me.

22:27.216 --> 22:29.785
You remain crucial
to my policy team.

22:29.786 --> 22:31.953
All right, boys and girls,
I got a promotion.

22:31.954 --> 22:34.822
So first order of business
is to issue a press release,

22:34.823 --> 22:36.490
which I already have written.

22:36.491 --> 22:38.359
Colette, if you would
do the honors.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.595
In the me file under phase one.

22:40.596 --> 22:42.830
Okay, and you and you,

22:42.831 --> 22:44.999
I need you to move this desk.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.268
Let's go.
Don't give me that sad orphan face.

22:47.269 --> 22:50.071
Take your little snack pack and your
water bottle and get the fuck out.

22:50.072 --> 22:51.673
- Hey, Dan.
- Yes?

22:51.674 --> 22:54.342
Congrats on the big promotion.
You and I should grab another drink.

22:54.343 --> 22:56.844
You know what? Run it by my secretary.
His name is Mike.

22:56.845 --> 22:58.579
No, no, no, you've got
to move that back.

22:58.580 --> 23:00.447
I'm not gonna have you
eyeballing me all day.

23:00.448 --> 23:02.482
- That's not gonna go there.
- Relax, cow eyes.

23:02.483 --> 23:04.451
I'm not gonna be sitting
here looking at your...

23:04.452 --> 23:06.553
cow eyes the whole time.
Guys, seat goes right here.

23:06.554 --> 23:08.187
- Shit, shit.
- What? What? What?

23:08.188 --> 23:10.089
Twitter eruption.
Veep's trending.

23:10.090 --> 23:14.092
- Amy, what's going on?
- Um, you're trending, ma'am.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.727
I'm on Twitter, but it wants
me to create a new account.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.995
- I don't know how to do that.
- Well, then do that.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.129
Amy, what the fuck?
What is it, Amy?

23:18.130 --> 23:20.531
This is the reporter
from Ohio, Felicia.

23:20.532 --> 23:23.067
Wait, wait.
No, I got it.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.202
"Got played by team veep.

23:25.203 --> 23:27.004
They wanted me
to make her cry."

23:27.005 --> 23:30.307
Hashtag FakeVeepWeep.
What the fuck?

23:30.308 --> 23:32.442
What? Who wanted
to make me cry?

23:32.443 --> 23:34.478
Mike engineered
your crying, ma'am.

23:34.479 --> 23:36.212
He said that he was
your puppet master.

23:36.213 --> 23:37.714
Actually, he said he was
your Pinocchio,

23:37.715 --> 23:40.084
but I think he meant Geppetto, who
was actually the puppet master.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.287
Mike got you to cry on camera.

23:42.288 --> 23:45.123
- What the fuck, Mike?
- What the fuck, Mike?

23:45.124 --> 23:47.926
Amy, get into my office.
Mike, especially you.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.762
Go into my office.
Okay.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.900
Holy Christ.
Look at the size of this one.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.270
Buddy, I think you're
as big as my gay dwarf.

23:57.271 --> 23:59.138
I need to see
the vice president now.

23:59.139 --> 24:01.741
Sorry, I don't work here.
I do work in the West...

24:01.742 --> 24:03.776
Well, then get the hell out of
my way, you leaning tower of...

24:03.777 --> 24:05.477
- Pisa.
- No.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.912
- Shit?
- Good.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.280
- Move it.
- Yes, sir.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.782
Hey, sweet cakes.
I need to get in to see the veep.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.218
Congressman, if you call me that again,
you'll need to see a paramedic.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.520
<i>- Take care of that.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

24:15.521 --> 24:17.455
- Big bully, what are you doing?
- You think I'm a crybaby?

24:17.456 --> 24:19.190
Sorry to barge in,
Madam Vice President.

24:19.191 --> 24:23.895
Yeah, Larry, listen.
Furlong is in the office.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.899
Don't talk to Furlong.
You need to keep a low profile.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.668
I just issued a press release
announcing my promotion.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.471
Bye, Dan.

24:31.472 --> 24:35.042
Frankly, ma'am, I'm angry.
Will, tell her why.

24:35.043 --> 24:37.144
The press claims that
you intentionally cried

24:37.145 --> 24:39.079
in order to divert attention
away from the fact

24:39.080 --> 24:41.381
that we had to bus people
into the fundraiser.

24:41.382 --> 24:43.984
<i>And now I'm being implicated
in your disgusting little lies,</i>

24:43.985 --> 24:47.254
and, actually, I don't feel like being
dragged into the toilet with you, ma'am.

24:47.255 --> 24:50.356
Number one, congressman,

24:50.357 --> 24:52.925
I'm sick of taking
your shit, okay?

24:52.926 --> 24:56.763
Number two, number one again.

24:56.764 --> 24:58.699
The crying was manipulated, ma'am.
I was manipulated.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.867
And this meeting
is now terminated

25:00.868 --> 25:03.570
because this was never
a meeting to even begin with.

25:03.571 --> 25:05.471
You're gonna need to leave
'cause I'm not really aware

25:05.472 --> 25:07.073
of where my actions
will take me, okay?

25:07.074 --> 25:09.409
What are you gonna do?
You gonna choke me with some spanx?

25:09.410 --> 25:12.479
Do you want to try me?

25:12.480 --> 25:15.682
You got breath mints
in that bag? Let's go.

25:15.683 --> 25:18.352
Oh, you got a nice big red dot in
the middle of your forehead, Danno.

25:18.353 --> 25:20.386
- And it ain't a fucking bindi.
- Excuse me?

25:20.387 --> 25:23.423
You'd better saddle up, cowgirl, 'cause
I'm gonna ride this whole office

25:23.424 --> 25:25.325
into a congressional
investigative hearing

25:25.326 --> 25:27.961
over the Macauley amendment
and the attendant corruption.

25:27.962 --> 25:29.523
Just relax.

25:29.524 --> 25:31.398
I think you might want to get yourself
a helmet, okay.

25:31.399 --> 25:34.467
And a bulletproof vest
and an iron jockstrap.

25:34.468 --> 25:38.137
'Cause you're gonna get your head shot,
your back stabbed, and your nuts danced on.

25:38.138 --> 25:40.506
Have a good Monday.

25:40.507 --> 25:42.040
Bye, Sue.

25:44.076 --> 25:47.045
All right, you're gonna need to
stay in your former position.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.214
Okay?
Keep a low profile.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.116
In your face, Dan.
Mmm!

25:52.117 --> 25:56.187
Um, ma'am, I may have already
issued a press release

25:56.188 --> 25:58.857
- regarding my promotion.
- Really?

25:58.858 --> 26:02.227
Well, can I unpromote you?
I don't think so.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.828
Is he my boss again?

26:03.829 --> 26:06.231
Only in title, all right?
You're still senior to him.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.768
- In your fucking face.
- Stop it, okay? Please, Mike.

26:09.769 --> 26:12.804
Hey, Dan, I'm gonna take
a rain check on that beer, okay?

26:12.805 --> 26:15.440
Oh, my God in heaven.
So, let's see.

26:15.441 --> 26:17.709
The guy that I have just
put in charge of rebutting

26:17.710 --> 26:20.179
is now in charge
of rebutting questions

26:20.180 --> 26:22.081
over the Macauley amendment,

26:22.082 --> 26:24.683
which is the very thing he should
be nowhere near rebutting.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.853
- Right?
- I did warn you about him, ma'am.

26:27.854 --> 26:30.556
Okay, get out, Amy.
Get out of my office.

26:44.437 --> 26:47.905
See, now...
now I want to cry.

26:47.906 --> 26:50.874
But I can't cry.

26:50.875 --> 26:53.443
- Can I get you a cup of tea? Okay.
- Yeah.

26:53.444 --> 26:57.914
You know, I mean, this job
has fucked me up so bad.

26:57.915 --> 27:00.885
<i>Now I don't fucking know
if I can cry anymore.</i>

27:03.422 --> 27:07.225
I wouldn't worry
about it, ma'am.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.829
I mean, you've only got
four years of this, so...

27:09.830 --> 27:13.133
Eight years, I guess,
if we got reelected,

27:13.134 --> 27:14.534
<i>obviously.</i>

27:14.535 --> 27:17.238
<i>12 if you run for president.</i>

27:18.340 --> 27:21.275
16, two-term.

27:23.011 --> 27:25.546
<i>So think about that.</i>

27:39.061 --> 27:41.028
<i>Egan, all right? Dan Egan.</i>

27:41.029 --> 27:42.797
That's Dan with a capital D

27:42.798 --> 27:45.232
and Egan with an open
your fucking ears.

27:45.233 --> 27:47.435
Yes, E as in ears.

27:49.671 --> 27:51.338
Yeah, I'll hold.

27:51.339 --> 27:55.475
When Dan goes home, I want
that desk back here, okay?

27:55.476 --> 27:58.645
<i>No, she's busy.
And tomorrow.</i>

27:58.646 --> 28:00.713
<i>Well, that's tomorrow
in the plural.</i>

28:00.714 --> 28:02.716
<i>All of them.</i>
