WEBVTT

00:06.195 --> 00:08.069
Oh, yeah, this is creepy.

00:08.070 --> 00:11.139
We've heard things. We've been touched.

00:11.140 --> 00:14.188
He can get physical if he wants to.

00:14.189 --> 00:16.244
My daughter talks about seeing things.

00:16.245 --> 00:19.108
It looked like a Grim Reaper.

00:19.109 --> 00:21.482
The death was suspicious.

00:21.483 --> 00:24.723
He was killed instantly.

00:25.048 --> 00:26.941
So you feel that whatever's
here wants you out?

00:26.942 --> 00:28.986
Absolutely.

00:28.987 --> 00:32.287
He wants to hurt people.

00:33.495 --> 00:36.033
They're being watched.

00:36.034 --> 00:38.941
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.942 --> 00:41.192
This thing likes death.

00:41.193 --> 00:42.975
I see dead people.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.543
This thing is, like, a monster.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.613
I speak to dead people.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.303
And he's pissed off now.

00:48.304 --> 00:49.812
And they speak to me.

00:49.813 --> 00:51.408
His head was cracked.

00:51.409 --> 00:54.388
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.389 --> 00:56.438
This guy was murdered.

00:56.439 --> 00:57.857
I rely on my partner.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.261
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:59.262 --> 01:01.212
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:01.213 --> 01:03.930
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:03.931 --> 01:07.023
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:07.024 --> 01:09.936
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.089
Why would you stay here?

01:11.090 --> 01:13.213
But Steve and I never speak...

01:13.214 --> 01:15.197
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:15.198 --> 01:16.609
Until the very end.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.383
Stop it.

01:18.384 --> 01:20.547
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

01:20.548 --> 01:22.953
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:22.954 --> 01:24.284
Or time to get out.

01:24.285 --> 01:28.965
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.213 --> 01:55.828
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

01:55.829 --> 01:59.314
I interview witnesses and dig
into the history of the location.

01:59.315 --> 02:03.070
While Amy communicates with the dead.

02:03.071 --> 02:07.556
At the end, we get together
to reveal our findings.

02:07.557 --> 02:13.457
I'm in Wichita, Kansas, on my way to a
property owned by a husband-and-wife team.

02:14.089 --> 02:19.626
They run a beauty salon and an
auto shop on the same property.

02:19.627 --> 02:23.230
The husband Jeff says violent spirits
are destroying his business,

02:23.231 --> 02:27.311
their family life, and their sanity.

02:36.457 --> 02:42.357
Amy needs to be free from outside
influences during her walk.

02:44.095 --> 02:47.302
So it's important that I cover
or remove all photographs,

02:47.303 --> 02:51.203
artwork, and even religious icons.

02:52.294 --> 02:58.194
Once I'm done, the building will
be clear for tonight's walk.

03:25.569 --> 03:29.409
Uh, well, I'm not open at all.

03:32.267 --> 03:38.167
I usually open to communicate with
the dead as I approach a location.

03:38.572 --> 03:44.472
But this area has such an overwhelming
amount of death surrounding it...

03:46.243 --> 03:51.583
That I decided to do my
opening inside the location.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.159
This is some... some...

04:02.160 --> 04:06.540
Some bad [Bleep] going on over in here.

04:08.003 --> 04:10.282
Not good. Not good at all.

04:10.283 --> 04:13.943
Yeah, this is some bad stuff.

04:16.344 --> 04:20.374
Bad ground. Always been bad.
Will always be bad.

04:20.375 --> 04:24.755
Bad [Bleep] is always gonna happen here.

04:37.915 --> 04:40.041
Jeff, you sounded concerned on the phone.

04:40.042 --> 04:41.453
Well, I am concerned.

04:41.454 --> 04:44.759
You know, really I'm fighting
to save two businesses here.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.119
- My wife has the salon here in front.
- Okay.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.303
And then I have my garage here at the back.

04:49.304 --> 04:51.036
Give me an idea what's going on.

04:51.037 --> 04:54.648
We've heard things. We've
been touched, pushed.

04:54.649 --> 04:58.385
We've had things misplaced
in the salon and the shop.

04:58.386 --> 05:00.549
I'd like my kids to be able
to take over the business,

05:00.550 --> 05:02.973
but right now I'm not even
comfortable having 'em in there.

05:02.974 --> 05:05.359
- How old are the kids?
- Fifteen and nine.

05:05.360 --> 05:09.102
My daughter's actually experienced things,
and you know, as a father that concerns me,

05:09.103 --> 05:12.666
because I'm, you know, not sure if she can
handle that or understands what's going on.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.734
How are you and your
wife handling all this?

05:14.735 --> 05:17.920
My wife would just as soon sell the
place, where I want to keep it.

05:17.921 --> 05:21.306
And you know, this is something that
we built over the last seven years...

05:21.307 --> 05:23.646
And I'm not just willing
to walk away from it.

05:23.647 --> 05:26.838
Okay. What about yourself? Have you ever
seen anything or experienced anything?

05:26.839 --> 05:28.702
I just finished working on some vehicles...

05:28.703 --> 05:30.100
- Okay.
- And I looked up inside,

05:30.101 --> 05:33.677
and I saw somebody standing there.

05:33.678 --> 05:35.781
Looked like an older gentleman, maybe.

05:35.782 --> 05:40.131
Um, I'm guessing him to be in his
mid to late 50s with a beard.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.902
Alright, did you go inside to search?

05:41.903 --> 05:43.553
We did. All of us went inside.

05:43.554 --> 05:48.354
We found out that there
was nobody in there.

05:52.640 --> 05:56.042
There's one kinda creepy dude.

05:56.043 --> 05:59.883
He's kinda like a greaser dude.

06:01.382 --> 06:03.750
And he likes his area.

06:03.751 --> 06:05.919
- What's that?
- Um...

06:05.920 --> 06:09.669
The driveway, this whole thing...

06:09.670 --> 06:11.864
This whole building...

06:11.865 --> 06:14.385
His territory.

06:16.498 --> 06:20.598
To me, he's, like, just a tough
guy, you know, just like...

06:20.599 --> 06:25.819
"I'm... I'm tough. I'm bad.
I'm big. I'm bad".

06:27.074 --> 06:31.200
Like, would you say that he's dangerous?

06:31.201 --> 06:33.061
Yes.

06:34.076 --> 06:37.556
But he's kinda [Bleep] up.

06:46.994 --> 06:49.196
So what's going on in here?

06:49.197 --> 06:51.665
There's a lot of things
that happen in here.

06:51.666 --> 06:54.668
We started to notice that
tools would come up missing.

06:54.669 --> 06:57.053
If you can't find 'em,
you can't work with 'em.

06:57.054 --> 06:59.751
- Anything else, Jeff?
- We've heard whispering.

06:59.752 --> 07:03.320
I remember a time I was leaned over the
back of a car, and I'm in there working.

07:03.321 --> 07:06.635
You know, you're turning wrenches, and
you're focused on what you're doing.

07:06.636 --> 07:10.763
And then suddenly someone
whispers in my ear.

07:10.764 --> 07:15.191
And I know that I'm alone in the garage
at that particular point, but I stand up.

07:15.192 --> 07:18.612
There was nothing in here.

07:20.552 --> 07:24.810
He likes to yell. Uh, he
likes to hear his voice.

07:24.811 --> 07:28.171
He likes to hear himself.

07:30.205 --> 07:32.706
He's able to manifest things.

07:32.707 --> 07:35.527
Like, it's weird.

07:36.876 --> 07:40.044
He likes to take things and make
'em disappear and reappear...

07:40.045 --> 07:42.449
Reappear in weird places.

07:42.450 --> 07:44.284
That's to irritate people.

07:44.285 --> 07:48.121
He doesn't want anybody in his space.
He hates them.

07:48.122 --> 07:49.923
- And what's...
- Living or dead.

07:49.924 --> 07:54.544
He just doesn't want anybody in his space.

07:55.096 --> 07:57.020
We were just opening up for the morning,

07:57.021 --> 08:02.541
and we heard footsteps run
right across the top of us.

08:04.590 --> 08:07.341
We had gone up there,
couldn't find anything.

08:07.342 --> 08:10.940
And that's when we really started to worry,
because we expected to find something.

08:10.941 --> 08:13.497
What the hell were you
thinking when that happened?

08:13.498 --> 08:16.975
It's disturbing. You're concerned.
You think somebody might be in here.

08:16.976 --> 08:20.857
But then a whole new fear rushes
over you that someone's not in here.

08:20.858 --> 08:24.112
So, Jeff, I'm assuming the guys you've got
working for you are, like, guy's guys,

08:24.113 --> 08:25.596
- you know, tough guys and...
- Yeah.

08:25.597 --> 08:27.396
They don't want to admit
that they're scared,

08:27.397 --> 08:29.090
but you can see fear in somebody's eyes.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.526
You can tell that they're not
just bothered by what happened,

08:31.527 --> 08:33.611
but that it actually frightened them,

08:33.613 --> 08:37.241
to the point that they don't even
want to talk about it sometimes.

08:37.243 --> 08:40.538
Do you think that anything that's going
on in the garage could be dangerous?

08:40.539 --> 08:43.850
If it can, you know, move tools around in a
garage, if it can do things like that...

08:43.851 --> 08:45.954
- Right.
- It could certainly try and hurt somebody.

08:45.955 --> 08:48.355
Right. Okay.

08:48.915 --> 08:53.835
Does this guy interact
with the living at all?

08:54.121 --> 08:58.353
Um, he can get physical if he wants to...

08:58.354 --> 09:01.002
Grabbing, pushing.

09:01.003 --> 09:03.142
- Okay.
- He likes to throw things.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.757
Could he hurt anybody?

09:04.758 --> 09:08.778
I think he, uh, I think he could.

09:09.675 --> 09:14.638
He's really good at the stuff
he's already learned how to do.

09:14.639 --> 09:18.959
He knows how to affect his environment.

09:23.154 --> 09:25.385
Obviously this is a storage space.

09:25.386 --> 09:28.053
Um, did you use it? I mean,
it's kinda, like, wasted.

09:28.054 --> 09:29.948
No. My guys have reported the same thing.

09:29.949 --> 09:32.381
None of 'em want to come back
here, you know, if they're gonna,

09:32.382 --> 09:35.529
put something in here for storage, they
either try and leave it for me to do,

09:35.530 --> 09:37.654
or they just come, throw it in
here, and yank the door shut.

09:37.655 --> 09:39.840
I wish we could use it, I wish
we could do something with it,

09:39.841 --> 09:41.708
but nobody likes to be out here.

09:41.709 --> 09:43.786
- Why?
- You just feel a presence...

09:43.787 --> 09:45.572
A heaviness about the area.

09:45.573 --> 09:48.626
It's like you can't get a full
breath, you know, in your lungs.

09:48.627 --> 09:50.073
Like you can't breathe all the way.

09:50.074 --> 09:51.526
Like you're in high altitude or something?

09:51.527 --> 09:54.647
Right, just like that.

09:58.511 --> 10:01.871
Oh, yeah, this is creepy.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.956
What is?

10:04.957 --> 10:08.377
The thing that's in here.

10:10.498 --> 10:13.699
Making me feel uncomfortable and scared.

10:13.700 --> 10:17.094
Like, I felt scared in my stomach.

10:17.095 --> 10:19.435
What thing?

10:22.110 --> 10:24.090
Death.

10:37.301 --> 10:39.737
This is creepy.

10:39.738 --> 10:41.898
What is?

10:45.010 --> 10:47.152
Um, it looked like...

10:47.153 --> 10:49.899
Like a Grim Reaper.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.957
But I think it's, you know, just
a regular dead person because,

10:52.958 --> 10:56.755
I've seen death, and it doesn't...
doesn't look anything like that.

10:56.756 --> 10:59.172
We all associate certain images with death.

10:59.173 --> 11:02.178
And we take those images
with us when we die.

11:02.179 --> 11:06.892
It had, like, the whole thing, like,
skeleton face and the whole...

11:06.893 --> 11:09.804
Cloak and the sickle.

11:09.805 --> 11:13.858
This dead man's projection is childish,
but it is still creeping me out.

11:13.859 --> 11:16.801
Which is exactly what he wants to do.

11:16.802 --> 11:21.272
Now I'm picking up on his
death state and feeling, um,

11:21.273 --> 11:23.637
everything that he went through physically.

11:23.638 --> 11:26.853
It's, like, really hurting my head.

11:26.854 --> 11:31.277
- I just feel very, very sick.
- You gonna be all right?

11:31.278 --> 11:33.808
I'm out of it. Like, my equilibrium's off.

11:33.809 --> 11:36.449
Uh, disoriented.

11:37.606 --> 11:40.726
It [Bleep] hurts, man.

11:47.392 --> 11:51.015
So, Emily, I was talking to your
husband Jeff and he basically said,

11:51.016 --> 11:53.460
you were ready to put the "for sale"
sign on this place and get outta here.

11:53.461 --> 11:54.627
What's going on?

11:54.628 --> 11:59.202
From the first time we unlocked the door
here, it's never felt like it's been ours.

11:59.203 --> 12:02.169
- Why do you say that?
- Um, stuff moves.

12:02.170 --> 12:04.341
People get pushed.

12:04.342 --> 12:07.154
You hear people whispering in your ears.

12:07.155 --> 12:10.169
Doing hair there was a container
sitting on my cabinet,

12:10.170 --> 12:13.852
it was in the middle of the station it
flipped in the air, and landed on its side.

12:13.853 --> 12:16.920
- What was in the can? Was it heavy?
- It was heavy, it was like a pomade.

12:16.921 --> 12:18.906
It was bad. It was scary.

12:18.907 --> 12:22.697
He never came back and got his hair cut.
And he was a regular for years.

12:22.698 --> 12:25.104
Okay, so you're losing business
because of what's going on.

12:25.105 --> 12:27.064
Absolutely. One time I said...

12:27.065 --> 12:30.303
"Show me you're here, do something so that
I know you're here, and I'm not crazy".

12:30.304 --> 12:33.207
And I turned to shut the door behind
me, and I saw someone standing

12:33.208 --> 12:35.810
right in the entryway between the
kitchen and the living room.

12:35.811 --> 12:38.402
- Who'd you see?
- I saw a man standing there.

12:38.403 --> 12:40.410
With a shirt and jeans.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.447
He had a goatee and gray hair.

12:42.448 --> 12:44.907
All right, so do you feel that
whatever's here wants you out?

12:44.908 --> 12:47.188
Absolutely.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.690
The dead man inside the garage is so sick,

13:01.691 --> 13:05.375
that I'm experiencing exactly what
he went through when he died.

13:05.376 --> 13:09.413
The pain is so intense
that I have to leave.

13:09.414 --> 13:14.394
There's a lot of stuff
coming in from outside.

13:15.613 --> 13:20.173
I'm, like, seeing this woman who's alive.

13:22.703 --> 13:25.231
But the dead are just, like, following her.

13:25.232 --> 13:27.318
And then they're inside.

13:27.319 --> 13:29.052
Why are they following her?

13:29.053 --> 13:32.713
Uh, because she has abilities.

13:36.260 --> 13:41.565
Do you have any idea if this Reaper
guy does follow her in here?

13:41.566 --> 13:43.426
Yes.

13:46.611 --> 13:48.511
Can he do anything to people here?

13:48.512 --> 13:52.410
Cause headaches and breathing issues...

13:52.411 --> 13:56.551
And feeling like you're gonna vomit.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.522
Okay, so what's going on here?

14:05.523 --> 14:07.914
My daughter talks about seeing things.

14:07.915 --> 14:11.983
She even drew a picture of, like,
a black figure with red eyes.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.038
And she said that's something she saw here.

14:14.039 --> 14:15.908
- Where's the picture?
- I threw it away immediately.

14:15.909 --> 14:19.246
- I didn't want to think about it again.
- Now what did she say it was?

14:19.247 --> 14:22.814
It had no form, but you could tell it had
arms and legs, and it was all black.

14:22.815 --> 14:24.116
How'd you react to it?

14:24.117 --> 14:27.703
It made my heart stop, because I don't
want to be putting her in danger.

14:27.704 --> 14:29.180
Emily, your daughter's 9?

14:29.181 --> 14:32.391
Yes. I want to preserve her innocence.

14:32.392 --> 14:34.668
I don't want her to be scared.

14:34.669 --> 14:36.589
Okay.

14:39.468 --> 14:43.131
The dead guy who showed himself
to me as the Grim Reaper...

14:43.132 --> 14:46.679
Throughout his life he
seems to have some money.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.408
Does he try to show himself to the living?

14:49.409 --> 14:53.480
Well, he wants to, because
he has his disguises.

14:53.481 --> 14:56.346
He likes the Grim Reaper the best.

14:56.347 --> 14:59.385
So would people see him as
the Grim Reaper in here?

14:59.386 --> 15:02.320
I would think that he would
come off more like...

15:02.321 --> 15:07.295
Like just, like, a black
mass or something like that.

15:07.296 --> 15:10.118
And he wants to...

15:10.119 --> 15:14.019
Make other people hurt themselves.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.771
Daniel, I was talking to Jeff,

15:22.772 --> 15:25.788
and he mentioned that you
do work for him on and off.

15:25.789 --> 15:28.511
He said you might have had
experiences here yourself.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.797
Yeah, something did happen one night.

15:30.798 --> 15:33.052
Me and Jeff were working with
a battery that overheated.

15:33.053 --> 15:34.873
We went and set it down
and got another one.

15:34.874 --> 15:39.621
A couple minutes later I went back to
the kitchen to get something to drink,

15:39.622 --> 15:44.698
opened the freezer up, and the
battery was sitting in the freezer.

15:44.699 --> 15:46.833
So where'd you lay the battery down first?

15:46.834 --> 15:51.037
Laid the battery down on the counter
across from the refrigerator.

15:51.038 --> 15:52.706
Jeff was with me the whole time.

15:52.707 --> 15:54.307
And nobody else was in the house?

15:54.308 --> 15:56.743
Nobody else was there at that time.

15:56.744 --> 16:01.348
When that happened to me, I was
more cautious about working here.

16:01.349 --> 16:04.450
- You don't look like you scare easy.
- I don't scare easy.

16:04.451 --> 16:06.333
I spent nine years in the Marine corps.

16:06.334 --> 16:09.778
But stuff that you can't
explain tends to, you know,

16:09.779 --> 16:15.679
scare you a little bit to where you're
thinking, "what's going on here?"

16:19.600 --> 16:23.436
The greaser dude, he likes his area.

16:23.437 --> 16:25.849
The entities here are very territorial.

16:25.850 --> 16:31.750
As soon as I walk to the garage, I'm
back in the greaser guy's space.

16:32.117 --> 16:36.319
He gets pissed, you know,
if people are in his area.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.685
So he will try to make them leave.

16:38.686 --> 16:40.996
Do you know how?

16:40.997 --> 16:46.897
Things will be moved, like, taken
from one place and put in another.

16:48.255 --> 16:51.116
I think this guy is
actually Apporting [Bleep].

16:51.117 --> 16:53.436
Apporting is the ability
to make things disappear,

16:53.437 --> 16:55.468
and reappear in different locations.

16:55.469 --> 17:00.929
Entities that have mastered
this can be very dangerous.

17:05.816 --> 17:09.154
He's, like, really kind of a sociopath.

17:09.155 --> 17:12.205
Like, he doesn't have any...

17:12.207 --> 17:15.926
Feelings or anything like that.

17:19.218 --> 17:21.665
I feel like...

17:21.666 --> 17:23.999
Him, like, grabbing, like, my face.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.400
You know, like, he would do that...
You know, like...

17:37.710 --> 17:39.731
I'm headed over to meet
with a woman named Cheryl.

17:39.732 --> 17:42.800
She's the former owner of the property.

17:42.801 --> 17:47.180
She tells me her time on the
property ended in tragedy.

17:47.181 --> 17:51.921
I've gotta find out what this is all about.

17:59.017 --> 18:02.519
Cheryl, I got called in to
investigate your old home.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.156
- How long did you live there?
- About five years.

18:05.157 --> 18:08.392
What did you use the garage for?
Was it always a garage?

18:08.393 --> 18:12.827
We did a lot of hangouts
with friends in there.

18:12.828 --> 18:18.093
People came by every day, and
it was like they lived there.

18:18.094 --> 18:20.071
Looks like you had a good
time, a lot of bikers.

18:20.072 --> 18:22.691
A lot of bikers.

18:22.692 --> 18:25.463
Uh, I gotta ask an unusual question.

18:25.464 --> 18:27.030
The people that are living
there now are claiming

18:27.031 --> 18:29.581
there's a lot of paranormal
activity going on.

18:29.582 --> 18:32.179
When you lived there, did you ever
experience anything like that?

18:32.180 --> 18:36.711
Nothing happened paranormally, but we lost
three of our dear friends within a year.

18:36.712 --> 18:39.532
- Really?
- Right.

18:41.960 --> 18:46.040
This is Kevin. He's in the middle.

18:46.201 --> 18:47.738
How'd you lose Kevin?

18:47.739 --> 18:52.570
Kevin was hit by a car on his motorcycle,
and he was killed instantly.

18:52.571 --> 18:54.373
And then we lost Tony.

18:54.374 --> 18:56.875
And he practically lived there.

18:56.876 --> 18:59.744
He had a stroke, and he died.

18:59.745 --> 19:01.746
He looks like a young guy, though.
How old was he?

19:01.747 --> 19:05.347
Oh, he was in his late 50s.

19:05.919 --> 19:09.487
And then we had Mark, and he passed
away, and he was a dear friend.

19:09.488 --> 19:14.734
He had previously lived in the basement
of that house back 20 years ago.

19:14.735 --> 19:15.992
And what did he die of?

19:15.993 --> 19:19.692
He went to bed and didn't wake up.

19:19.693 --> 19:21.233
I don't know what happened to him.

19:21.234 --> 19:26.771
I mean, he went from driving a brand-new
car to just living month to month.

19:26.772 --> 19:28.830
He had some problems and some issues.

19:28.831 --> 19:34.731
He lived in an apartment complex that had
a lot of people that did drugs in it.

19:34.766 --> 19:39.129
Whatever he was doing, he just
looked worse every time I saw him.

19:39.130 --> 19:42.132
Were you surprised when
they found him dead?

19:42.133 --> 19:43.933
No.

19:50.007 --> 19:52.463
The greaser dude, he's tall.

19:52.464 --> 19:56.759
He's wearing a black,
like, '50s biker jacket.

19:56.760 --> 20:01.260
He killed himself, and he was intoxicated.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.959
He was mad when I walked away.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.469
As soon as I asked the
greaser guy about his death,

20:06.470 --> 20:11.634
he gets very angry and wants
nothing to do with me.

20:11.635 --> 20:15.595
He's not gonna talk to me again.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.918
Cheryl had some pretty tragic stories about

20:21.919 --> 20:24.707
the people that used to
hang out at her house.

20:24.708 --> 20:27.833
But no deaths actually happened there.

20:27.834 --> 20:33.734
So I'm at the Genealogical Society seeing
what I can dig up in the archives.

20:34.752 --> 20:37.150
Turns out in 1977...

20:37.151 --> 20:39.121
A former owner named Helen Hillman,

20:39.122 --> 20:44.931
died on the property when she
fell down a flight of stairs.

20:44.932 --> 20:47.473
I've asked a local reporter
to look into the accidental

20:47.474 --> 20:50.602
death of a woman who lived on
Jeff and Emily's property.

20:50.603 --> 20:52.957
I'm heading over to the cemetery
where the woman is buried,

20:52.958 --> 20:57.038
to find out the rest of the story.

21:04.238 --> 21:08.118
Well, this is actually where
Helen Hillman is buried.

21:08.119 --> 21:11.153
She was married when she was 19 in 1917.

21:11.154 --> 21:13.895
That's a picture of her and
William on their wedding day.

21:13.896 --> 21:17.388
Then they moved from Arkansas to
right outside of Wichita, Kansas,

21:17.389 --> 21:19.247
on the property that you're investigating.

21:19.248 --> 21:20.497
And when did they move in?

21:20.498 --> 21:22.514
1947, I believe.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.420
Now what were you able to find out
about the circumstances of her death?

21:25.421 --> 21:30.544
Well, according to her death certificate,
it said "massive head injury".

21:30.545 --> 21:34.261
Even though she was 79, according to her
descendants, she was in good health.

21:34.262 --> 21:36.025
They said that she had a zest for life.

21:36.026 --> 21:38.418
She was active. She lived independently.

21:38.419 --> 21:40.146
All right, so it was odd the way she died.

21:40.147 --> 21:41.906
Yes, it was very odd.

21:41.907 --> 21:44.458
She had lived in that house for so long,

21:44.459 --> 21:47.306
and the distance between
the stairs and the floor,

21:47.307 --> 21:49.958
wouldn't be enough to
kill someone, typically.

21:49.959 --> 21:52.810
- It says "massive head injuries".
- Mm hmm.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.046
I don't know if that fall can
cause injuries like that.

21:55.047 --> 22:00.447
Yes, and that's why I think
the death is suspicious.

22:02.715 --> 22:05.895
There's another person.

22:05.917 --> 22:08.857
She's more evolved.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.240
She's not in her death state anymore.

22:14.241 --> 22:17.852
- She got out of that pretty quickly.
- Okay.

22:17.853 --> 22:21.513
I think she broke her neck...

22:22.393 --> 22:25.273
Early of mid '70s.

22:27.686 --> 22:31.046
She was dead, like, fast.

22:49.991 --> 22:51.613
She's not in her death state anymore.

22:51.614 --> 22:55.620
- She got out of that pretty quickly.
- Okay.

22:55.621 --> 22:57.580
Early of mid '70s...

22:57.581 --> 23:00.701
That's when she died.

23:01.586 --> 23:04.210
She was dead, like, fast.

23:04.211 --> 23:06.851
Broke her neck.

23:09.705 --> 23:13.125
Oh, God, it [Bleep] hurts.

23:21.958 --> 23:24.809
This woman is making me extremely sad.

23:24.810 --> 23:27.626
She's in so much physical
and emotional pain.

23:27.627 --> 23:30.194
That she seems lost and confused.

23:30.195 --> 23:32.656
And most of all scared.

23:32.657 --> 23:37.577
She kind of, uh, runs
away from living people.

23:39.991 --> 23:43.951
Sometimes she's reliving her life.

23:44.797 --> 23:48.517
Ah, now I'm getting her pain.

24:01.767 --> 24:03.472
I'm on my way to meet with a historian,

24:03.473 --> 24:05.789
who helped me out the last
time I was in Wichita.

24:05.790 --> 24:07.734
He dug deep into the property's history,

24:07.735 --> 24:13.555
and he told me he uncovered some
pretty unusual information.

24:19.445 --> 24:21.400
So, Anthony, what were you
able to find out about the

24:21.401 --> 24:23.886
early history of the
property I'm investigating?

24:23.887 --> 24:26.134
The interesting thing about
this piece of property,

24:26.135 --> 24:28.772
is the number of times
that it's changed hands.

24:28.773 --> 24:33.911
Over 30 people have owned it since
it was first purchased up until now.

24:33.912 --> 24:37.118
Out of all these people that tend
to come and go on this property,

24:37.119 --> 24:39.466
did anybody stand out?

24:39.467 --> 24:43.239
Yeah, a Dr. Alfred Ray was one of the guys,

24:43.240 --> 24:46.300
that seemed to be very, very interesting.

24:46.301 --> 24:49.532
He was a physician who came
to this part of the country.

24:49.533 --> 24:51.858
He brought his whole family with him,

24:51.859 --> 24:55.070
and he purchased this property,
from the outside looking in,

24:55.071 --> 24:58.234
we assume that he was going to
be setting up his family there.

24:58.235 --> 24:59.994
And living on it for generations.

24:59.995 --> 25:02.742
And yet within less than six months,

25:02.743 --> 25:08.643
he's already sold the property and has
moved on with his whole family with him.

25:08.649 --> 25:12.284
The reason why Dr. Ray stands out so much,

25:12.285 --> 25:15.045
is that he was a man with business savvy.

25:15.046 --> 25:18.953
And yet he comes to this one
particular piece of property.

25:18.954 --> 25:20.648
He's there for six months.

25:20.649 --> 25:23.813
And then he left it without
even developing it.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.454
That's strange.

25:32.737 --> 25:36.049
Bad [Bleep] is always gonna happen here.

25:36.050 --> 25:41.950
It's like, oh, kinda bad, worse,
worse, really, really bad...

25:42.244 --> 25:44.944
[Bleep] Terrible.

25:45.835 --> 25:51.671
So basically it's... it's anybody
that lives here or on this land is...

25:51.672 --> 25:53.562
Are they gonna have problems because of it?

25:53.563 --> 25:55.783
Oh, yeah.

25:58.315 --> 26:03.034
You know, they'll have,
uh, struggle and, uh...

26:03.035 --> 26:05.834
You know, negative things will happen.

26:05.835 --> 26:09.553
So I think it's just automatically gonna...

26:09.554 --> 26:11.354
Draw negativity.

26:11.355 --> 26:14.658
And, like, I think it makes people angry.

26:14.659 --> 26:18.799
It makes people act in bizarre ways.

26:27.472 --> 26:29.857
During my walk I saw a strange scene,

26:29.858 --> 26:33.443
where a living person was leading
a trail of dead into the house.

26:33.444 --> 26:37.481
I'm meeting with a sketch artist
to describe what I encountered.

26:37.482 --> 26:42.522
I saw this woman at the
door about to open it.

26:43.837 --> 26:45.979
Behind her...

26:45.980 --> 26:49.280
Is this really tall man.

26:49.929 --> 26:54.309
And he is wearing, like, a black cloak.

26:55.771 --> 26:59.637
And then slightly to his right is...

26:59.638 --> 27:05.538
The back of a man who is wearing a
cowboy hat, jeans, and cowboy boots.

27:10.841 --> 27:14.321
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:15.987 --> 27:17.847
Yes.

27:37.163 --> 27:39.687
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations.

27:39.688 --> 27:45.140
It's time to sit down with Jeff and his
wife Emily to reveal what we've uncovered.

27:45.141 --> 27:49.523
This is Emily and Jeff. They're married
and actually own this property.

27:49.524 --> 27:51.929
Jeff actually runs the garage here.

27:51.930 --> 27:53.991
Emily runs the salon up front.

27:53.992 --> 27:56.993
They've had a lot of experiences here.
It's affecting work.

27:56.994 --> 27:59.655
It's affecting business. And it's
affecting their relationship.

27:59.656 --> 28:03.280
They want to make sure it's okay for them
to stay here and if it's safe for the kids.

28:03.281 --> 28:09.161
That being said, we'll hear a
little bit about Amy's walk.

28:12.246 --> 28:17.612
When I started my walk, I came into
contact with this creepy male.

28:17.613 --> 28:21.316
He is a really tall guy.
He had a leather jacket.

28:21.317 --> 28:23.818
His hair is greased back.

28:23.819 --> 28:26.815
He hates anybody in his space.

28:26.816 --> 28:29.825
Because he considers the
driveway, that front area,

28:29.826 --> 28:33.127
and this entire garage and
the back of it his space.

28:33.128 --> 28:36.278
One night I remember this
guy looking from the back,

28:36.279 --> 28:39.102
and as I started to go inside...

28:39.103 --> 28:42.823
They were gone just like that.

28:42.904 --> 28:45.313
When he gets upset, he likes to yell.

28:45.314 --> 28:48.080
He likes to throw things.

28:48.081 --> 28:50.849
He also does a thing called Apporting.

28:50.850 --> 28:52.234
What the hell is Apporting?

28:52.235 --> 28:56.194
It's a phenomena where
an object can disappear,

28:56.195 --> 28:58.336
from one place and reappear in another.

28:58.337 --> 29:01.742
Seemingly out of thin air.

29:01.743 --> 29:05.152
Why don't you tell Amy about
some of your experiences here.

29:05.153 --> 29:07.676
We definitely get things
moving here all the time.

29:07.677 --> 29:11.818
And whatever's doing this is
moving at a great distance.

29:11.819 --> 29:14.203
Well, I mean, he definitely has a mission.

29:14.204 --> 29:18.793
And everything he does
is to get you to leave.

29:18.794 --> 29:21.410
He did try to physically attack me.

29:21.411 --> 29:27.311
So I feel like he wants to hurt
the living if he hasn't already.

29:29.055 --> 29:31.968
We started to have a really good dialogue,

29:31.969 --> 29:36.700
but what ended up happening was I
felt like he had killed himself.

29:36.701 --> 29:38.439
And I said that...

29:38.440 --> 29:40.601
And he was so,

29:40.602 --> 29:44.382
irate that he just stormed off.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.082
I spoke to the previous
owners of the property.

29:47.083 --> 29:50.586
And they told me this garage
was basically a party house.

29:50.587 --> 29:54.607
So all the bikers would come here.

29:54.651 --> 29:57.459
There was a bar in here.
There was a pool table.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.187
Right after they sold the property,

29:59.188 --> 30:02.608
three of the guys that hung out
here on a continuous basis...

30:02.609 --> 30:04.710
Died within a year.

30:04.711 --> 30:08.073
One died in an accident, got
killed on his motorcycle.

30:08.074 --> 30:10.570
The other guy died of a stroke.

30:10.571 --> 30:15.551
And then the third guy
is this guy right here.

30:16.484 --> 30:18.814
Now his name was Mark.

30:18.815 --> 30:21.210
A lot of the friends thought
he was on a downward spiral,

30:21.211 --> 30:25.587
and that he was in a sense killing
himself by what he was doing to himself.

30:25.588 --> 30:30.628
He actually lived in the
basement of your salon.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.207
Does this guy look familiar at all?

30:34.208 --> 30:38.275
Yeah, I remember distinctly seeing this.

30:38.276 --> 30:43.470
The look in his eyes, him looking
back at me was very similar.

30:43.471 --> 30:45.689
Now, Emily, you saw an apparition.

30:45.690 --> 30:49.389
Yes, between the kitchen
and the living room.

30:49.390 --> 30:51.479
Does this look familiar at all?

30:51.480 --> 30:53.377
Oh, yes, absolutely.

30:53.378 --> 30:57.158
I'm scared with my kids
or my husband out here.

30:57.159 --> 31:00.798
Would he hurt me or somebody out here,
or is he just trying to scare us?

31:00.799 --> 31:04.219
No, he wants to hurt you.

31:04.374 --> 31:06.585
He wants you out.

31:06.586 --> 31:09.827
For a dead person to learn how to...

31:09.828 --> 31:13.008
Throw objects, apport...

31:13.178 --> 31:18.278
If you put those together,
you've got a problem.

31:23.127 --> 31:25.647
So what else did you see on your walk?

31:25.648 --> 31:29.848
I saw a woman up in the attic area.

31:29.920 --> 31:34.373
She was, like, re-experiencing her life,
so sometimes she's, like, back in it.

31:34.374 --> 31:38.002
But when she's here, she's very frightened.

31:38.003 --> 31:40.273
She doesn't know where she
is or what's going on.

31:40.274 --> 31:42.140
And she's terrified of the living.

31:42.141 --> 31:45.266
- Now you said the attic?
- Yeah, up those stairs.

31:45.267 --> 31:50.797
We opened the attic door at one point, and
it was almost like we startled someone.

31:50.798 --> 31:55.152
And whatever it was ran
across to the corner.

31:55.153 --> 31:57.686
And we fully expected to find someone.

31:57.687 --> 32:01.739
So we ascended the ladder,
looking for something up there.

32:01.740 --> 32:03.608
There was... there was
never anything there.

32:03.609 --> 32:06.878
She's just really, really terrified.

32:06.879 --> 32:11.619
Her death was so fast
and extremely painful.

32:11.879 --> 32:14.350
She didn't really process it.

32:14.351 --> 32:17.334
It was a very sharp...

32:17.335 --> 32:19.880
Pain in the neck.

32:19.881 --> 32:24.137
And I did get that she died in the '70s.

32:24.138 --> 32:26.068
There's a woman, Helen Hillman,

32:26.069 --> 32:31.533
who lived in the house that your
salon is in from 1947 to 1977.

32:31.534 --> 32:34.073
1977 is when she died.

32:34.074 --> 32:38.634
She fell down the steps into the basement.

32:39.203 --> 32:41.666
- That's where they found her.
- Wow.

32:41.667 --> 32:45.376
She died of massive head injuries.

32:45.377 --> 32:48.917
That's her and her husband.

32:53.815 --> 32:58.075
That's really sad, really, really sad.

33:00.094 --> 33:02.095
So what else did you get on the walk?

33:02.096 --> 33:06.532
I saw something really strange
in the old garage area.

33:06.533 --> 33:11.093
What I saw was your typical Grim Reaper...

33:11.600 --> 33:16.552
The skeleton face, the sickle,
the cloak, the whole thing.

33:16.553 --> 33:19.244
And that's really odd,
because I've seen death,

33:19.245 --> 33:21.820
before and death actually
does not look like that.

33:21.821 --> 33:26.773
So as I'm looking deeper, I can feel
and tell that this is a dead person.

33:26.774 --> 33:28.992
That it's a dead male.

33:28.993 --> 33:32.449
That he hid in life a lot,

33:32.450 --> 33:35.473
and now he's hiding again in death.

33:35.474 --> 33:38.241
When I went in there, I, um...

33:38.242 --> 33:41.075
Felt like I had been beaten up.

33:41.076 --> 33:44.762
I couldn't breathe. My head felt
like it was going to explode.

33:44.763 --> 33:47.050
Tell her the feeling you guys
get when you go back there.

33:47.051 --> 33:50.081
The back side of the property,
especially by that old garage...

33:50.082 --> 33:52.690
We feel this... this pressure.

33:52.691 --> 33:56.506
And I would say it's like the air's
kinda sucked out of the room.

33:56.507 --> 34:02.407
It would be like being in high altitude,
really, but there's no explanation for it.

34:02.611 --> 34:07.753
Basically, he wants to cause
pain and to hurt people.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.792
He's trying to stop you from breathing?

34:09.793 --> 34:11.652
Yes.

34:12.955 --> 34:16.034
The other thing that I saw was...

34:16.036 --> 34:19.755
A sensitive who... who's here.

34:20.056 --> 34:23.547
And she knowingly or unknowingly...

34:23.549 --> 34:27.404
Lets the dead on the property
into the main house.

34:27.405 --> 34:28.922
They just kind of follow her.

34:28.924 --> 34:32.596
And this includes the Grim Reaper guy.

34:32.597 --> 34:35.415
Remember the dark mist with your daughter?

34:35.416 --> 34:37.275
Tell Amy about that.

34:37.275 --> 34:41.443
She drew a figure that
she saw in the basement.

34:41.444 --> 34:46.514
It was a full figure like a human,
but with red eyes and all black.

34:46.514 --> 34:48.882
And she drew a picture of that.
I said, "oh, what's this?"

34:48.884 --> 34:52.911
She said, "oh, mom, that's
the man in the basement".

34:52.913 --> 34:57.328
Okay, I did do a sketch of what I saw.

34:57.329 --> 35:03.229
As far as this individual leading
several dead people into the house.

35:10.049 --> 35:11.849
Oh.

35:15.594 --> 35:17.994
Is that me?

35:37.373 --> 35:40.833
I did do a sketch of what I saw.

35:40.834 --> 35:46.547
As far as this individual leading
several dead people into the house.

35:46.548 --> 35:48.468
Okay.

35:56.041 --> 35:57.841
Oh.

36:07.224 --> 36:09.624
Is that me?

36:19.352 --> 36:22.859
When was the first time
you had an experience?

36:22.860 --> 36:25.440
When I was 2.

36:26.860 --> 36:31.120
What kind of experiences have you had?

36:32.666 --> 36:34.706
A lot.

36:35.828 --> 36:38.681
I noticed doing hair that I
can't even touch some people,

36:38.682 --> 36:44.582
or I feel, like, their pain, and
I start crying for no reason.

36:51.762 --> 36:56.682
Is there a reason why
you're running from it?

37:00.307 --> 37:04.267
It's something that if you run...

37:04.277 --> 37:07.380
Or try to run from it...

37:07.381 --> 37:12.106
They're gonna follow you. And it's
hereditary, it runs in families.

37:12.107 --> 37:15.467
I see it in my daughter.

37:19.245 --> 37:22.742
Prior owners never felt this or anything.

37:22.743 --> 37:27.717
Nobody ever... is it because possibly
she's a sensitive that this is happening?

37:27.718 --> 37:32.420
If they see somebody who can talk
to them who's ignoring them...

37:32.421 --> 37:35.781
They get a little feisty.

37:41.479 --> 37:44.641
The last thing that I got is...

37:44.642 --> 37:47.162
Really crappy.

37:47.901 --> 37:51.775
This land draws negativity to it.

37:51.776 --> 37:54.700
And a lot of bad things have happened here.

37:54.701 --> 37:57.159
When people are here, they struggle.

37:57.160 --> 37:58.707
They go broke.

37:58.708 --> 38:01.625
They... there's fires. There's robberies.

38:01.626 --> 38:06.950
You know, like, it's never okay in...
in this, going way back, area.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.337
Hmm, it's interesting you say
that, though, because...

38:10.338 --> 38:14.476
What we're sitting on was
part of a 160-acre farm.

38:14.477 --> 38:20.377
And it got turned over 30 times
in 80 years, which is unheard of.

38:21.010 --> 38:23.753
There's surrounding farms...

38:23.754 --> 38:27.651
No problems. They didn't...
families for generations.

38:27.652 --> 38:31.192
It makes total sense to me.

38:33.864 --> 38:36.662
Well, you've seen the results
of the investigation,

38:36.663 --> 38:38.652
learned about the dark
history of this property.

38:38.653 --> 38:42.339
You've seen and heard who
Amy's encountered here.

38:42.340 --> 38:44.809
But the most important question
is, is it gonna be safe,

38:44.810 --> 38:47.159
for you guys, your employees, customers...

38:47.160 --> 38:49.527
Most importantly your family?

38:49.528 --> 38:54.028
For that I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

38:56.359 --> 39:00.514
There's a few things that are
going to have to be done.

39:00.515 --> 39:03.827
The first thing is dealing with the land.

39:03.828 --> 39:09.288
The house is actually in a
good position on the land.

39:10.121 --> 39:15.651
But once you get to the back deck, it
begins to get progressively worse.

39:15.652 --> 39:20.041
But it gets really dark when
you hit the old garage.

39:20.042 --> 39:25.622
That's where a line literally
needs to be drawn weekly.

39:25.656 --> 39:29.188
And all you have to do is
draw a line with salt.

39:29.189 --> 39:33.889
And that'll help with the whole
contamination factor of the land here.

39:33.890 --> 39:39.790
The other thing that needs to be done is
to take care of the girl in the attic.

39:40.062 --> 39:44.180
This is something that you
innately have the ability to do.

39:44.181 --> 39:45.948
Get some Sage and some salt.

39:45.949 --> 39:49.092
Go ahead and Sage the building
inside and out, including the attic.

39:49.093 --> 39:51.254
Then taking the salt...

39:51.255 --> 39:56.175
And drawing a line all
along the walls inside.

39:56.299 --> 39:58.493
Tossing it around the attic,

39:58.494 --> 40:03.938
and taking the salt all around the
outside of the building as well.

40:03.939 --> 40:06.494
What about the Grim Reaper
and the greaser guy?

40:06.495 --> 40:11.893
So the greaser guy and the Grim
Reaper are actually the same person.

40:11.894 --> 40:16.634
And at some point after
death, he fractured.

40:18.118 --> 40:21.719
Occasionally, I'll meet a dead person...

40:21.720 --> 40:25.020
That forms an attachment.

40:26.135 --> 40:27.849
So...

40:27.850 --> 40:31.163
I'm going to go ahead and
take him home with me.

40:31.164 --> 40:33.470
- What the hell are you talking about?
- He's attached to me anyway,

40:33.471 --> 40:34.953
so I'll just take him home...

40:34.954 --> 40:39.348
Until I reunite the
shattered aspect of him.

40:39.349 --> 40:43.054
And then I'm able to help move him on.

40:43.055 --> 40:47.863
The other thing I want to talk to you about
is the fact that you are a sensitive,

40:47.864 --> 40:49.865
and your daughter is a sensitive.

40:49.866 --> 40:53.761
And there's things that you need to do now

40:53.762 --> 40:57.749
to make it a comfortable
environment for her.

40:57.750 --> 41:00.994
For you, what this is...
this is gaining knowledge,

41:00.995 --> 41:03.868
learning how to control your environment.

41:03.869 --> 41:06.488
And your daughter's environment,
and teaching her those skills,

41:06.489 --> 41:10.032
so she can protect herself as well.

41:10.033 --> 41:13.047
Let me ask you a question. What about him?
How does he help her?

41:13.048 --> 41:18.134
The main thing is for right
now is just being supportive.

41:18.135 --> 41:20.087
It's really tough to think,

41:20.088 --> 41:23.091
that they were experiencing more
than I was this entire time,

41:23.092 --> 41:24.607
both my wife and my daughter.

41:24.608 --> 41:26.745
You know, you're trying to protect 'em.

41:26.746 --> 41:28.310
Now are you gonna be all right
doing this with your daughter,

41:28.311 --> 41:29.595
you gonna be comfortable with it?

41:29.596 --> 41:31.368
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

41:31.369 --> 41:32.975
And you guys are gonna do this stuff?

41:32.976 --> 41:35.189
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

41:35.190 --> 41:37.987
The good news is you don't have to leave.

41:37.988 --> 41:40.628
Very good news.

41:41.398 --> 41:43.678
Thank you.
