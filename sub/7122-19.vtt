00:44.500 --> 00:46.400
Why did I do that?

00:53.500 --> 00:54.800
Did you find them?

01:01.600 --> 01:03.000
Will they be okay?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I told him that his Vietnamese noodles were

01:20.025 --> 01:22.025
too tough before he went missing.

01:22.050 --> 01:24.050
Why did I say such a thing!

01:24.075 --> 01:26.075
What if something bad happens to him!

01:26.100 --> 01:29.500
The last conversation we had was that his noodles are bad.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.500
Sorry. Guess I've taken too much noodle.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.500
What if he attacks you with a knife!

02:05.700 --> 02:07.700
What if he tries to hurt you!

02:16.000 --> 02:17.300
That's right.

02:17.325 --> 02:19.125
I'm little bit too worrying sometimes.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.250
I always got haunted by the nightmare

02:21.351 --> 02:23.074
that half-dead corpses attacking my house!

02:23.275 --> 02:25.375
My uncle, aunt-in-law, cousins were all present,

02:25.376 --> 02:27.699
I even hear the crying coming from the upstairs.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.700
I just wished that I could protect my family.

02:30.125 --> 02:34.125
I become too stressful during that dream,

02:34.450 --> 02:36.150
I even grind my own teeth badly!

02:39.100 --> 02:40.300
When I wake up in the morning,

02:40.300 --> 02:41.800
all my teeth are cracked!

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I usually try to forget about it,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
thinking that it's just a dream

02:46.025 --> 02:47.025
 or I'm being paranoid,

02:48.200 --> 02:51.000
but I was actually attacked by these half-dead corpses before,

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
twice!

03:33.000 --> 03:34.300
It's hard to see things

03:45.600 --> 03:46.400
What's that?

03:58.700 --> 04:00.500
Ahh! Stop it! Help!

04:27.700 --> 04:28.900
Your weapons!

05:24.000 --> 05:26.100
Princess you're making me sweat.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.000
This chamber is bigger than my love for pretty birds' song!

06:00.000 --> 06:01.500
Eh, Yeah, don't worry about me.

06:01.525 --> 06:03.025
I'm perfectly, perfecty fine.

06:04.050 --> 06:06.050
Let's go, get up!

06:08.475 --> 06:09.775
I don't think this will work.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.700
You should go alone,

06:10.725 --> 06:12.025
I'm just your obstacle.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.100
Is Jake awake?

10:51.700 --> 10:52.700
It's fine.

10:53.025 --> 10:55.025
That was my fault for hiding it.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.300
Honey,

11:00.625 --> 11:02.625
I've got something terribly important to tell you.
