in historic Charles Towne.

11:17.291 --> 11:21.834
Okay? But it's not where
we're arriving, it's when.

11:21.834 --> 11:25.375
Okay, we are taking
a trip through time,

11:25.375 --> 11:28.458
all the way back
to the year 1670,

11:28.458 --> 11:31.750
when the British settlers
established what would
eventually become

11:31.750 --> 11:35.583
the first permanent settlement
here in the Carolinas.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.041
Okay? It's gonna
be a lot of fun.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.959
Unless-- unless--
if I may interject here,

11:39.959 --> 11:43.250
unless we choose not to have
fun and act like assholes.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.250
Then it's not gonna
be pretty. Trust me.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.750
But none of us are assholes,
and actually using language

11:47.750 --> 11:50.667
like that is one example
of what not to do on this trip.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.959
Actually, make your
own rules for yourself,

11:52.959 --> 11:55.959
because I'm--
I make rules for myself,
you make rules for you,

11:55.959 --> 11:57.750
and then I make rules
for you guys as well.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.333
That's-- that's fine.
But I don't think
we'll have any problems,

12:00.333 --> 12:04.125
but I want everybody
to be individuals, okay?
Soak in the culture.

12:04.125 --> 12:05.458
And don't act like assholes.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.875
Because that's gonna
be enough and that's enough.

12:07.875 --> 12:09.708
Enough is enough.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.792
Believe that.
Believe that.

12:11.792 --> 12:14.834
Clear? All right. Go ahead,
that's done, we're done.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.250
He sits first, then I sit.
I'm the last one.

12:18.250 --> 12:22.417
Guys, now, this is so cool,
everything you see here today

12:22.417 --> 12:26.208
is exactly as it was
over 300 years ago.

12:26.208 --> 12:29.458
Which means no iPads,
no phones, no cars.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.917
Uh, how about,
"No thank you."
(laughter)

12:32.917 --> 12:36.333
Guys, you'll also see
the various characters
from settlement life,

12:36.333 --> 12:41.166
such as craftsmen, militia,
and yes, even slaves.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.250
Oh, I don't know about this.
What's that, Mr. Gamby?

12:43.250 --> 12:45.000
They shouldn't have
to do this. That's racist.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.458
It's part of history.

12:46.458 --> 12:47.834
Charles Towne had slaves.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.375
Well, I'm sorry,
but I don't believe in that.

12:49.375 --> 12:50.792
Hayden:
You don't have
to believe in it,

12:50.792 --> 12:52.500
it doesn't change the fact
that slavery happened.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.250
Bill, why are you
arguing with me?

12:54.250 --> 12:55.834
I'm saying that slavery
is wrong, all right?

12:55.834 --> 12:57.542
There's no reason
for you to be arguing with that.

12:57.542 --> 12:59.208
I'm-- that's--
I'm not arguing with that.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.125
Look, don't make the whole
field trip about yourself.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.625

You know how to use a camera?

14:25.750 --> 14:27.583
Get a picture.
Hayden, you're out.

Great work, Hayden.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.291

we're all framed up. Okay?

Let me get the flash ready here.
Bruce, just open the--
the camera app.

14:43.166 --> 14:45.000
Not the photo app.
No, wait, there it is. I got it.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.083
This is gonna be good.
No, don't take the photo.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.625
Done.
Erase it now.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.125
Looks nice.
Bruce, will you post it?

14:50.125 --> 14:51.208
Bruce: Here.
Get me out of here.

14:51.208 --> 14:52.542
Want to see it?
Get me out.

You better not have gotten it.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.458

I didn't want this picture.

I'll check out the chill suite.
Turkey legs didn't

but being helpful?

23:22.166 --> 23:25.375
You know what I think's
going on? I think you're
trying to turn her against me.

23:25.375 --> 23:28.041
(scoffs) Do you have
a crush on Ms. Snodgrass?

23:28.041 --> 23:31.792
Psh! No. She's ugly.

23:31.792 --> 23:33.333
Holy shit! Hey!
No!

23:33.333 --> 23:34.417
Hey!
No!

23:34.417 --> 23:35.625
Fucking, hey!
Get out of her!

23:35.625 --> 23:37.625
No! No! Oh, my God!
Shit!

23:37.625 --> 23:39.500
Hayden: Oh, my God!
Gamby: Fuck!

23:39.500 --> 23:42.500
(muffled shouting)

23:49.500 --> 23:52.917
(exhales) How dare
you make this trip sexual.

23:52.917 --> 23:55.625
What are we in trouble for?
For being in love?

23:55.625 --> 23:58.166
For being an idiot.
That's bullshit.

23:58.166 --> 24:00.792
You know what's bullshit,
Kyle Gebhart? You are, mister.

24:00.792 --> 24:03.250
You came on this trip
with big designs, didn't you?

24:03.250 --> 24:07.625
Thought you'd come out here and
expand your sexual conquests,
but instead what happened?

24:07.625 --> 24:11.792
You failed. You must
feel like a fool, right?
Pretty fucking pathetic.

24:11.792 --> 24:13.542
I think we've all
learned our lesson here.

24:13.542 --> 24:17.458
Hayden, I say
when lessons have been learned.

24:17.458 --> 24:19.834
Lessons have been learned.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.959
Now Mr. Hayden's gonna
take you to your rooms,

24:21.959 --> 24:23.875
since he caused
this whole entire debacle.

24:23.875 --> 24:25.959
I'm sorry, what?
Yeah, you heard me, Bill.

24:25.959 --> 24:29.208
This is what happens
when faculty members get
shitfaced on mudslides.

24:29.208 --> 24:31.000
I'm just glad
that everyone is safe.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.875
Yeah, so am I.
Bill, what are you doing?

24:32.875 --> 24:36.375
Get these kids up to their room.
Let's go.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.250
Well, that's enough excitement
for me, for one night.

24:39.250 --> 24:41.959
Yeah, me too.
Um, good night.

24:41.959 --> 24:45.041
Good night. (sighs, laughs)

24:45.041 --> 24:49.041
Got to hand it to you,
Mr. Gamby, you and Bill
really saved the day.

24:49.041 --> 24:51.834
Well, Bill didn't
do anything.
He was useless.

24:51.834 --> 24:55.542
(laughs) Totally. Useless.

24:55.542 --> 24:59.542
Oh! Pretty wild night, huh?
No.

24:59.542 --> 25:01.875
You're wrong,
it wasn't wild at all.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.667
Guess it wasn't that wild.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.583
Uh-uh. Don't just agree
with everything I'm saying.

25:05.583 --> 25:07.750
It's annoying.
Yep. That's weird.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.750
I don't know--
I don't know why I did that.

25:09.750 --> 25:14.083
After I said it was wild,
I was thinking, "Pfft!
No, it wasn't."

25:14.083 --> 25:17.542
(snoring)

25:31.583 --> 25:35.417
No, dog. (coughs, snores)

25:43.125 --> 25:45.625
(phone vibrates)

26:05.166 --> 26:08.708
Oh. Hey, Neal.
You're awake early.

26:08.708 --> 26:10.875
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I didn't sleep much

26:10.875 --> 26:12.458
with all the excitement
last night.

26:12.458 --> 26:13.917
Kind of a messy night, huh?

26:13.917 --> 26:15.375
Yeah. To say the least.
(laughs)

26:15.375 --> 26:18.917
Hey, listen, um, about
what I said last night.

26:18.917 --> 26:23.041
That was... uncool of me.
I'm sorry.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.500
I shouldn't have--
No, you don't
have to apologize.

26:25.500 --> 26:29.333
We all did stuff
last night that I'm sure
we'll regret forever.

26:29.333 --> 26:33.792
What did you do
that you would regret forever?

26:33.792 --> 26:36.333
Just that I was supposed
to get my daughter a souvenir.

26:36.333 --> 26:39.500
It's the only thing
I did that's regretful really.

26:39.500 --> 26:42.375
Do you want me to help you
pick something out?

26:43.417 --> 26:45.041
You'd do that?
Of course.

26:45.041 --> 26:47.500
Okay, yeah.
That'd be cool. Uh...
Okay.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.250
She's 13 years old,
what do you think?
Think she'd like this?

26:50.250 --> 26:51.834
This-- this too small?
(laughs)

26:51.834 --> 26:53.917
Maybe you should
buy her some food.

26:53.917 --> 26:56.500
(laughs) She has--
eats a lot.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.166
Does she like
these horses, maybe?

26:59.166 --> 27:01.500
Actually, she loves horses.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.291
Um... I'm amazing.

27:03.291 --> 27:05.333
This big monster here.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.917
120 bucks.
(exhales)

27:06.917 --> 27:09.208
Maybe the old wooden
Native American one.

27:09.208 --> 27:10.417
Yeah.
Don't get her that one.

27:10.417 --> 27:11.458
You think this one?
Yeah.

27:11.458 --> 27:13.333
Come on.
It's worth it.

27:13.333 --> 27:15.208
Yeah. That's easy.

27:15.208 --> 27:16.750
