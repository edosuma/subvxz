- Yes.

02:20.648 --> 02:22.775
We've got a possible donor.

02:22.850 --> 02:26.183
We've done the first EEG,
and the family has agreed.

02:26.254 --> 02:28.347
Give me the details.

02:28.423 --> 02:31.085
Male, 35 years old.

03:09.197 --> 03:10.391

03:10.465 --> 03:12.092
The movie's starting.

03:12.166 --> 03:14.157
I'm coming.

03:19.607 --> 03:22.599
Eve Unveiled

03:22.677 --> 03:24.542
They always change the title!

03:24.612 --> 03:27.046
''All About Eve'' should be
''Todo Sobre Eva.''

03:27.682 --> 03:29.616
But that sounds odd.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.552
What areyou writing?

03:40.628 --> 03:41.993
Nothing.

03:43.297 --> 03:44.821
Future Pulitzerwinners.

03:44.899 --> 03:46.730
ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER

03:46.801 --> 03:49.269
Eat up. You have to put on
a few pounds.

03:49.337 --> 03:52.704
Some dayyou may have
to work the street to keep me.

03:53.174 --> 03:56.337
You don't need pounds for that.
You need a big dick.

03:57.078 --> 03:59.444
Where did you learn
to talk like that?

03:59.680 --> 04:02.706
- You asked.
- I wasjoking.

04:05.186 --> 04:07.620
- And you?
- What about me?

04:07.688 --> 04:10.248
Would you prostituteyourself
for me?

04:11.793 --> 04:14.762
I've already done
just about everything foryou.

04:17.430 --> 04:19.125
Eat up!

04:46.394 --> 04:47.793
Notatall.

04:47.862 --> 04:49.796
Margo,
this is Eve Harrington.

04:49.864 --> 04:52.264
- Howdoyoudo, my dear?
- Hello.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.699
Would you like to be
an actress?

04:54.769 --> 04:57.329
It was hard enough
becoming a nurse.

04:57.405 --> 04:59.896
Ifyou were an actress,
I'd write parts foryou.

05:00.708 --> 05:03.176
I was in an amateur group
when I was young.

05:03.244 --> 05:05.405
I wasn't bad.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.447
I must have a picture
somewhere.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.510
I'd love to see it.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.914
I'll look for it later.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.987
Look, Esteban.

05:21.062 --> 05:23.155
I found a picture.

05:26.868 --> 05:30.133
We were doing a show
based on texts by Boris Vian.

05:31.105 --> 05:33.596
Cabaret for intellectuals.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.877
Happy birthday!

05:47.955 --> 05:50.719
- Already?
- It's midnight, sweetheart.

05:51.993 --> 05:54.985
'' Music for Chameleons.''
How did you know I wanted it?

05:55.963 --> 05:57.624
I knowyou like Capote.

05:58.266 --> 06:00.257
Read me something,
like when I was little.

06:05.139 --> 06:06.766
''Preface.

06:07.942 --> 06:10.172
I started writing
when I was eight.''

06:10.244 --> 06:12.405
See? I'm not the only one.

06:13.214 --> 06:15.739
''I didn't know
that I had chained myselffor life...

06:15.816 --> 06:18.751
to a noble
but merciless master.

06:18.819 --> 06:22.414
When God hands you a gift,
he also hands you a whip...

06:23.991 --> 06:27.654
and the whip is intended
only for self-flagellation.''

06:28.596 --> 06:30.757
That's enough
to putyou offwriting.

06:30.831 --> 06:32.696
Don't be so lame.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.759
It's a wonderful preface.

06:35.836 --> 06:39.067
How doyou want
to celebrateyour birthday?

06:39.140 --> 06:41.370
I'd like to see
one ofyour seminars.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.966
Why?

06:43.044 --> 06:46.070
I'm writing a story aboutyou
for a competition.

06:47.014 --> 06:51.451
And I'd like to seeyou act
in those organ donation courses.

06:51.519 --> 06:54.682
Well, I'd have to check
with Mamen.

06:54.755 --> 06:56.950
She's the psychologist
in charge ofthe seminar.

06:57.024 --> 06:58.992
Fine. Do it.

07:00.428 --> 07:03.158
I don't think I likeyou writing
about me.

07:03.230 --> 07:05.721
Your husband is dead, ma'am.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.098
That's impossible.

07:08.169 --> 07:10.899
Wejust saw him in the ICU.
He seemed to be breathing.

07:10.972 --> 07:15.432
We've explained that, ma'am.
A machine is breathing for him.

07:15.509 --> 07:18.501
Wouldyoulike us
to contactyour family?

07:19.280 --> 07:21.077
Idon'thaveany family.

07:21.782 --> 07:23.909
Justmyson.

07:24.719 --> 07:27.517
MyGod!
Howam Igoing to tellhim?

07:27.588 --> 07:30.022
Whenhe wasalive,
didyourhusbandsayanything...

07:30.091 --> 07:32.559
regardingorgan donation?

07:32.626 --> 07:35.459
Did he care about such matters?

07:35.529 --> 07:37.895
When we was alive,
he cared only about living.

07:38.966 --> 07:43.062
But I presume he was concerned
with the lives ofothers.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.328
I don't understand.

07:45.406 --> 07:49.365
What my colleague means
is thatyour husband's organs...

07:49.443 --> 07:51.775
couldsave otherpatients'lives.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.440
But weneed
yourauthorization forthat.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.746
Youcouldgivehim
a transplant?

07:57.818 --> 08:01.219
Notexactly.
The other wayaround, actually.

08:10.831 --> 08:14.961
Now we'll discuss
what happened in the simulation.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.403
Lookwhen you cross the street!

09:01.415 --> 09:03.747
- What wereyou thinking?
- I had an idea.

09:03.818 --> 09:06.184
An idea!
Give him the tickets.

09:11.492 --> 09:14.154
Whyareyoulookingatmelike that?
Do Ilookawful?

09:14.228 --> 09:17.026
No, youlookbetterthan ever.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.693
Look, thatmustbe
thegentlemanyou were expecting.

09:20.768 --> 09:23.134
You aren't Mr. Huntleigh!

09:24.238 --> 09:26.433
Neither areyou!

09:43.891 --> 09:46.257
These fingernails will have
to be trimmed.

09:48.028 --> 09:49.256
Thejacket, Doctor.

09:49.330 --> 09:52.060
Ask her to let go ofme!

09:52.133 --> 09:53.122
Please!

09:54.568 --> 09:56.559
Let her go.

10:01.342 --> 10:03.572
Get up.

10:06.714 --> 10:09.182
Lean on my arm...

10:09.850 --> 10:12.182
Miss DuBois.

10:12.253 --> 10:13.720
Thankyou.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.277
Whoeveryou are...

10:15.356 --> 10:19.520
I have always depended
on the kindness ofstrangers.

10:30.471 --> 10:32.803
Come on, baby.
The worst is over.

10:32.873 --> 10:35.569
Don't touch me.
Don't ever touch me again, bastard!

10:35.643 --> 10:37.440
Watch your language!

10:45.953 --> 10:47.978
Stella, come here.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.388
I'm never coming back
to this house.

10:57.264 --> 10:59.391
Never!

11:05.639 --> 11:07.937
I'd like to get
Huma Rojo's autograph.

11:08.008 --> 11:11.637
- In this weather?
- What's that got to do with it?

11:18.752 --> 11:20.481
What ifnobody comes out?

11:20.554 --> 11:23.717
Let's wait a while.
It's my birthday.

11:24.558 --> 11:27.254
Look, autumn's here already.

11:27.995 --> 11:30.486
- So long.
- Seeyou tomorrow.

11:33.100 --> 11:36.069
Nina Cruz really moved you,
didn't she?

11:36.136 --> 11:39.162
No, not her. Stella.

11:39.506 --> 11:43.875
Twentyyears ago, we did Streetcar
with the drama group in my town.

11:43.944 --> 11:46.208
I played Stella.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.407
Your fatherwas Kowalski.

11:48.482 --> 11:51.679
Some dayyou'll have to tell me
all about my father.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.686
All I know is
he died before I was born.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.780
- It isn't an easy story to tell.
- I guess not.

11:56.857 --> 11:59.519
Oryou'd have told me by now.

11:59.593 --> 12:02.562
I nearly asked for that
as a birthday present.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.598
I'm not sure
it would be a nice present.

12:04.665 --> 12:08.066
You're wrong.
It would be the best one.

12:10.704 --> 12:14.196
Then I'll tell you everything
when we get home.

12:16.243 --> 12:18.939
Working in theater
is worse than being a nun!

12:21.215 --> 12:24.946
You think not being able to get stoned
all day is being a nun!

12:25.019 --> 12:26.452
Yeah, I do!

12:28.088 --> 12:30.579
Alfonso XII Street, number 30.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.122
Come on, forget about it!

13:08.228 --> 13:10.128
My son!

13:37.791 --> 13:41.625

14:05.786 --> 14:08.346
Yes?

14:08.422 --> 14:10.913
We've got a possible donor.
He's in the ICU.

14:10.991 --> 14:12.686
They've done the first EEG...

14:12.760 --> 14:15.456
but the mother hasn't given
her consentyet.

14:15.529 --> 14:17.121
Can I have the details?

14:17.197 --> 14:19.222
I don't have them.
It's Manuela's son.

14:19.299 --> 14:22.700
The Manuela that I know?
The coordinator?

14:23.137 --> 14:25.697
Yes. He's dead.
It's awful.

14:48.228 --> 14:49.957
Unfortunately...

14:54.101 --> 14:57.264
the result ofthe EEG
is what we'd feared.

15:05.813 --> 15:08.441
We have to make a decision
immediately.

16:09.943 --> 16:11.570
We have to go.
We have to call.

16:11.645 --> 16:15.206
- I'll do it. You calm down.
- I am calm-- but call them.

17:24.651 --> 17:26.983
We're outside now,
sweetheart.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.610
We're out at last.

17:28.689 --> 17:31.351
He looks great.
Who'd have believed it?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.416
He certainly didn't.

17:33.493 --> 17:35.290
I feel I can breathe
like before.

17:35.362 --> 17:37.990
- Even better.
- With an 1 8-year-old's heart!

17:38.065 --> 17:42.126
- I'll fixyou some apple fritters.
- No, he has to be careful.

17:45.339 --> 17:48.137

Ididn't want to tellher,
butmylife ismissing thatsamehalf.

18:10.364 --> 18:12.628
I was worried.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.465
I thoughtyou'd never call.

18:15.535 --> 18:17.628
I called
as soon as I got to Madrid.

18:17.704 --> 18:19.365
I mean in Argentina.

18:19.439 --> 18:21.703
I called you loads oftimes...

18:21.775 --> 18:24.403
but I must have got
your aunt's numberwrong.

18:25.178 --> 18:28.773
I wasn't in Argentina, Mamen.
I went to Coruña.

18:38.725 --> 18:40.852
Why did you go there?

18:43.597 --> 18:46.862
I went after my son's heart.

18:46.933 --> 18:49.902
Who told you?
How did you know?

18:49.970 --> 18:51.460
I looked in the files...

18:51.538 --> 18:54.939
until I found the name and address
ofthe transplant recipient.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.272
You shouldn't have.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.938
It was wrong,
and the best way to go crazy.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.072
- Look at me, damn it!
- I know that.

19:02.149 --> 19:05.084
The best thing for me
is to quit the NTO and leave Madrid.

19:05.152 --> 19:08.280
- I didn't say that.
- Butyou think it-- and you're right.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.290
I think I won't even unpack.

19:11.358 --> 19:15.226
You're in no shape to travel alone.
You're ill.

19:15.295 --> 19:17.855
You have to rest up
and get better.

19:17.931 --> 19:19.694
I'll stay here tonight.

19:19.766 --> 19:23.293
- Then come home with me.
- I want to be alone, Mamen.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.032
- Try to be reasonable.
- How?

19:35.348 --> 19:38.749
Seventeenyears ago,
Imade thissamejourney...

19:38.819 --> 19:42.346
butin the opposite direction,
from Barcelona to Madrid.

19:43.023 --> 19:45.389
I was runningaway then too...

19:45.459 --> 19:47.222
butI wasn'talone.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.552
I was carrying Esteban
insideme.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.496
I was runningaway
from his fatherthen...

19:54.868 --> 19:58.804
andnowI'mgoing
insearch ofhim.

21:03.937 --> 21:06.735
- Shall I keep going?
- Yes, go on.

22:30.323 --> 22:31.984
Stop!

22:35.695 --> 22:37.993
Son ofa bitch!

22:46.373 --> 22:49.103
You're crazy, you faggot!

22:58.351 --> 23:00.114
Son ofa bitch!

23:10.263 --> 23:13.790
- What did you do?
- I hit him with a stone.

23:14.334 --> 23:16.894
- Help me get him up.
- Get up. Come on.

23:18.505 --> 23:21.235
Come on,Juan. Get up.

23:21.308 --> 23:23.902
Areyou all right?
Stand up.

23:24.477 --> 23:26.877
Let's get moving.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.381
Come on, quickly.

23:31.184 --> 23:34.210
What a fucking useless psychopath!

23:36.022 --> 23:37.717
Look.

23:40.427 --> 23:42.827
See that bonfire
where the ''tops'' are?

23:42.896 --> 23:44.488
Ask for Ursula.

23:44.564 --> 23:47.226
Tell herAgrado sentyou.
She'll fixyou up.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.460
Agrado!

23:51.071 --> 23:52.265
It's you!

23:52.339 --> 23:54.273
Manolita!

23:59.045 --> 24:00.512
You're hurt.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.844
No, no, it's your blood.

24:02.916 --> 24:05.714
It isn't becauseyou saved my life,
but how I've missed you!

24:05.785 --> 24:09.084
Eighteen years-- not a word,
not a letter, not a fucking call.

24:09.155 --> 24:11.282
I thoughtyou were dead, bitch!

24:11.358 --> 24:13.087
You can tell me everything
at home.

24:13.159 --> 24:17.425
We'll stop by a drugstore first.
Can we get a taxi here?

24:17.497 --> 24:19.021
Over there.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.990
With any luck,
we won't get mugged on the way.

24:22.068 --> 24:25.902
- You got the knife?
- Yes, and a rock in my purse.

24:28.908 --> 24:30.739
Hey, there, bonanit.

24:33.279 --> 24:35.941
Look, I'm sorry I wokeyou.

24:36.616 --> 24:39.141
- Hey, come over here.
- No. What doyou want?

24:39.252 --> 24:42.710
- We're not going to eatyou.
- What doyou want?

24:42.822 --> 24:44.722
Let me do the talking.

24:44.791 --> 24:48.386
Povidone-iodine,
approximation sutures...

24:48.461 --> 24:51.760
Thrombocid,
sterilized gauze and--

24:51.831 --> 24:54.857
- You got any alcohol?
- No, I drank it all last night.

24:54.968 --> 24:56.731
I mean for disinfecting.

24:56.803 --> 25:01.206
No. I've got Vaseline, condoms
and lots ofbandages.

25:01.674 --> 25:04.438
- Anything else?
- Alcohol, please.

25:05.745 --> 25:08.976
Oh, Manolita!
The Barceloneta!

25:09.049 --> 25:11.517
Those were the days!
You remember?

25:12.118 --> 25:15.884
Yes.
Please, don't moveyour head.

25:18.324 --> 25:20.258
You know anything
about her?

25:20.326 --> 25:22.351
About who? Lola?

25:22.429 --> 25:25.193
- Unfortunately.
- What happened?

25:25.265 --> 25:27.096
I took her in.
She was in a bad way.

25:27.167 --> 25:30.227
As usual,
with all the shit she takes.

25:30.303 --> 25:32.430
I came back from working
the Field all night...

25:32.505 --> 25:34.700
and she'd cleaned the place out.

25:34.774 --> 25:37.902
Watches,jewelry, '70s magazines
that were my inspiration.

25:37.977 --> 25:39.706
300,000 pesetas.

25:39.779 --> 25:41.474
What hurt most was...

25:41.548 --> 25:44.745
she took a statue ofthe Virgin
that my mother gave me.

25:44.818 --> 25:47.048
What for?
She doesn't believe in anything!

25:47.120 --> 25:51.147
Unless she's in a satanic sect
and wanted it for some ritual.

25:51.524 --> 25:53.458
I see she hasn't changed.

25:53.526 --> 25:56.154
To do that to me,
with all she owes me!

25:56.229 --> 25:59.630
Since we met in Paris 20 years ago,
I've been like a sister to her.

25:59.699 --> 26:02.668
We got our tits together.
You know better than anyone.

26:05.538 --> 26:09.030
- You never saw her again?
- No, and I don't want to.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.770
Areyou looking for her?

26:12.011 --> 26:13.706
Yes.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.946
We've got unsettled business.

26:19.519 --> 26:22.215
Why did you go offlike that?

26:25.225 --> 26:27.125
Won'tyou tell me anything?

26:29.395 --> 26:31.386
I can't.

26:32.699 --> 26:34.223
Some other day.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.435
All right.

26:36.503 --> 26:38.232
Just don't disappear again.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.835
I like to say good-bye
to the people I love...

26:41.908 --> 26:44.877
even ifit's only
to cry my eyes out, bitch.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.794
I can't believe it.

27:20.079 --> 27:22.070
I look like the Elephant Man!

27:23.016 --> 27:26.076
Don't exaggerate.
It'sjust a bit swollen.

27:26.152 --> 27:28.746
A bit swollen?
Where can I go with a mug like this?

27:29.522 --> 27:31.285
Come and eat something.

27:31.357 --> 27:33.882
Why did you go
to all this trouble?

27:33.960 --> 27:36.588
Salad-- how wonderful!

27:36.896 --> 27:39.694
It really hurts to chew!

27:39.766 --> 27:41.256
I won't be able to suck.

27:41.334 --> 27:43.234
You shouldn't work today.

27:43.303 --> 27:44.930
What can I do?

27:45.004 --> 27:46.995
Lola cleaned me out.
I have to work.

27:47.073 --> 27:49.598
Look, caramel spread!
And meat pie!

27:49.676 --> 27:50.973
And myprovoleta .

27:51.044 --> 27:52.705
I have to work too.

27:52.779 --> 27:54.872
Ifyou want,
we can look together.

27:54.948 --> 27:56.540
Oh, yes!

27:58.218 --> 28:00.743
Sinceyou left,
I haven't had a decent meal.

28:00.820 --> 28:03.755
Well, also, as a model,
I have to watch my figure.

28:03.823 --> 28:06.690
The worst thing about this work
is you've got to look cute...

28:06.759 --> 28:11.492
and keep up with the latest advances
in surgery and cosmetics.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.538
You look terrific!

28:19.606 --> 28:21.904
Nothing like a Chanel
to makeyou feel respectable.

28:21.975 --> 28:23.272
You look it.

28:23.977 --> 28:26.172
Don't I look a bit ofa slut
in this suit?

28:26.246 --> 28:27.372
All the better.

28:27.447 --> 28:30.746
These nuns only help
whores and transvestites.

28:31.884 --> 28:33.647
Is that a real Chanel?

28:33.720 --> 28:38.453
No! How could I buy a real Chanel
with all the hunger in the world!

28:38.524 --> 28:41.015
All I have that's real
are my feelings...

28:41.094 --> 28:43.824
and these pints ofsilicone
that weigh a ton.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.888
I feel so old, Manolita,
and it isn't my age.

28:46.966 --> 28:49.332
It's because ofthe beating.

28:49.402 --> 28:52.667
The beating I've taken
for the last 40 years!

28:53.973 --> 28:56.203
- Hello.
- Come in.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.369
Areyou looking for someone,
or can I help?

28:58.444 --> 29:00.503
We want to see the girl
who goes to the Field.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.309
The cute one.

29:02.382 --> 29:04.509
Sister Rosa. She's inside.
Go on in.

29:04.584 --> 29:06.313
Thankyou.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.388
Rosa, look. Visitors.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.797
What happened toyour face?

29:24.871 --> 29:27.431
Nothing. A beating.
Occupational hazard.

29:27.507 --> 29:29.634
- Can we talk?
- Ofcourse.

29:29.709 --> 29:32.940
Let's go next door.
It's quieter.

29:33.012 --> 29:35.003
My friend and I want
to quit the street...

29:35.081 --> 29:36.673
but we need to work.

29:36.749 --> 29:39.718
Cleaning stairs, whatever.
We don't care.

29:39.786 --> 29:41.117
There isn't much else.

29:41.187 --> 29:44.645
Well, garbage collector,
or learning handicrafts here.

29:44.724 --> 29:47.625
Embroidered tablecloths,
dried flowers.

29:47.694 --> 29:49.992
I think I prefer
garbage collector.

29:50.697 --> 29:52.494
What can you do,
apart from the street?

29:52.565 --> 29:54.499
I've worked as a cook.

29:54.567 --> 29:56.330
She's practically a surgeon.

29:56.402 --> 29:58.302
Look at this face.
She did it.

29:58.371 --> 30:00.965
Better than Pitanguy.
She's a compatriot of Lola's.

30:01.307 --> 30:03.969
Really? Haveyou heard
anything about her?

30:04.677 --> 30:06.611
I haven't seen her in 1 8 years.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.613
She cleaned out my place.

30:08.681 --> 30:10.171
She was here.

30:10.249 --> 30:12.581
It must have been
about four months ago.

30:12.652 --> 30:15.086
We helped her through detox.

30:15.154 --> 30:16.985
I cared for her
through withdrawal...

30:17.056 --> 30:19.650
but then shejust disappeared.

30:19.726 --> 30:22.718
I'd like to see her
before I go to El Salvador.

30:22.795 --> 30:24.626
El Salvador?

30:24.697 --> 30:26.289
Maybe I'll sign on.

30:26.366 --> 30:29.631
I always thought I could
make it big in the Third World.

30:30.036 --> 30:31.936
Then come with me.
I won't be so alone.

30:32.004 --> 30:34.370
The street's getting worse here
every day.

30:34.440 --> 30:38.206
The whores were bad enough,
but the drag queens are wiping us out.

30:38.277 --> 30:40.370
I can't stand the drag queens.
They're sleazebags.

30:40.446 --> 30:42.676
They confuse transvestism
with a circus.

30:42.749 --> 30:44.512
Worse, with mime!

30:44.584 --> 30:47.144
A woman is her hair,
her nails...

30:47.220 --> 30:49.188
lips for sucking or for bitching.

30:49.255 --> 30:52.088
I mean, haveyou ever seen
a bald woman?

30:52.158 --> 30:54.820
I can't stand them.
They're all sleazebags!

30:56.429 --> 30:58.420
I doubt there are
many drag queens in El Salvador...

30:58.498 --> 30:59.988
but they're
in the middle ofa war.

31:00.066 --> 31:02.432
Yeah? I didn't know that.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.462
I'm replacing some nuns
who were murdered.

31:05.872 --> 31:09.467
I'm not sure
what I need right now is a war.

31:09.542 --> 31:11.840
You're terrible, Agrado.

31:12.678 --> 31:14.646
Soyou were a cook.

31:14.714 --> 31:15.772
Yes.

31:15.848 --> 31:17.577
Who? This one?

31:17.650 --> 31:19.277
The best!

31:43.443 --> 31:45.001
What a surprise!

31:45.077 --> 31:46.567
Hi, Mom.

31:46.646 --> 31:48.045
Are we interrupting?

31:48.114 --> 31:50.378
It doesn't matter.
We seeyou so rarely.

31:53.419 --> 31:55.751
- This is Manuela.
- Pleased to meetyou.

31:55.822 --> 31:58.222
Come inside.
Don'tjust stand there.

32:00.226 --> 32:01.853
Mom, Manuela is a cook...

32:01.928 --> 32:04.328
and as Florinda's gone,
I thought--

32:04.397 --> 32:07.366
Thankyou, darling.
Vicenta and I can manage.

32:07.433 --> 32:10.402
But how?
Dad alone needs two people.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.938
- Where is he?
- Out with the dog.

32:13.005 --> 32:14.472
- On their own?
- Ofcourse.

32:14.540 --> 32:15.837
What ifthey get lost?

32:15.908 --> 32:18.376
The dog knows the way home.
Don't worry.

32:18.444 --> 32:20.912
What a shame!
I reallywanted to see them.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.642
We'll go look for them,
but first we have to talk.

32:23.716 --> 32:24.808
Come into the studio.

32:24.884 --> 32:27.284
I'm sorryyou came for nothing.

32:27.353 --> 32:29.548
- It's all right.
- Try her for a few days.

32:29.622 --> 32:32.113
Think of Dad.
Manuela's a nurse.

32:32.191 --> 32:33.522
- As well as a cook?
- Yes.

32:33.593 --> 32:36.357
I prefer to look
afteryour father myself.

32:36.429 --> 32:39.887
I understand.
Thankyou anyway. I'll go.

32:39.966 --> 32:40.864
Good-bye.

32:40.933 --> 32:42.594
- Manuela.
- Yes?

32:42.668 --> 32:45.034
Wait here.
I won't be long.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.741
How dareyou bring
a whore here!

32:50.810 --> 32:53.802
It isn't easy to find help
who'll put up with you.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.279
But a whore!

32:55.348 --> 32:57.441
That's no reason
to be so rude.

32:57.517 --> 33:00.782
I don't like strangers
to see me forging Chagalls.

33:00.853 --> 33:02.480
Can'tyou understand?

33:02.555 --> 33:05.547
Manuela isn't a whore anymore.
She's given it up.

33:05.625 --> 33:07.115
How long haveyou known her?

33:07.593 --> 33:08.890
Since this morning.

33:09.328 --> 33:13.230
This morning?
You're incredible.

33:13.299 --> 33:15.062
Mywork is to help people...

33:15.134 --> 33:16.863
even ifI'vejust met them.

33:16.936 --> 33:18.870
Well, mine isn't.

33:18.938 --> 33:21.736
Don't look at me like that.
It doesn't mean I'm intolerant.

33:22.942 --> 33:25.911
- I'll makeyou a deal.
- A deal?

33:25.978 --> 33:30.176
I'll give that woman a chance
ifyou don't go to El Salvador.

33:30.249 --> 33:32.945
Mom, don't give me any more doubts.
I've got enough.

33:33.019 --> 33:35.579
And soyou should.
That trip is suicide!

33:35.655 --> 33:37.748
No, it's parricide!

33:37.823 --> 33:40.087
Well, I have to go.

33:40.159 --> 33:41.683
Manuela's waiting.

33:41.761 --> 33:45.162
Sure! Anywhore, any Salvadoran,
is more important than your parents!

33:45.231 --> 33:48.928
- Don't start, Mom.
- You should go see a psychiatrist.

33:50.570 --> 33:53.164
It wouldn't do
either ofus any harm.

33:54.340 --> 33:57.002
Didn'tyou want to see
your father and the dog?

33:57.076 --> 33:58.941
Another day.

33:59.011 --> 34:00.876
Areyou all right?

34:02.615 --> 34:05.106
Good-bye, Mom.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.521
- Hello, Vicenta.
- Rosa, love.

34:17.597 --> 34:20.157
- You're so thin. Aren'tyou eating?
- Yes, I am.

34:20.232 --> 34:22.757
- Did you see a blonde girl downstairs?
- No.

34:23.803 --> 34:26.168
- So long.
- Take care-- and eat!

34:38.551 --> 34:40.382
A STREETCAR NAMEDDESIRE

34:43.723 --> 34:46.351
I'm sorry about my mother.

34:46.425 --> 34:48.688
I'm sorry.

34:50.295 --> 34:51.263
Shall we go?

34:51.831 --> 34:54.732
I can't deal with my mother.
She drives me crazy.

34:55.434 --> 34:58.426
- Haveyou got parents?
- They're dead.

34:58.504 --> 35:00.665
Soyou're alone.

35:00.740 --> 35:02.605
I guess so.

35:02.675 --> 35:04.370
You look awful.

35:04.443 --> 35:07.241
I don't feel verywell.

35:07.313 --> 35:09.941
I want to throw up.

35:11.984 --> 35:13.645
I've got--

35:17.523 --> 35:19.252
Here.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.350
Haveyou seen the doctor?

35:22.828 --> 35:26.229
You should.
It mayjust be gastritis.

35:28.801 --> 35:31.861
Can we go toyour place
until this passes?

35:31.971 --> 35:33.336
Well--

35:33.406 --> 35:35.033
Doyou have a place?

35:35.107 --> 35:39.237
I'vejust rented one,
but it's barely furnished.

35:42.948 --> 35:45.576
It's quite a mess.

35:46.252 --> 35:48.743
I moved in four days ago.

35:49.021 --> 35:50.716
You want to lie down
for a while?

35:50.790 --> 35:53.520
No, I'll just sit here on the sofa...

35:53.592 --> 35:54.752
until it passes.

35:54.827 --> 35:56.692
I'm going to take this off.

35:58.931 --> 36:01.456
Who's this handsome boy?

36:03.369 --> 36:05.200
My son.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.205
I thoughtyou were alone.

36:10.276 --> 36:12.767
He died in an accident.

36:13.446 --> 36:16.040
Oh, I'm sorry!

36:19.251 --> 36:22.015
Don't touch the notebook,
please.

36:58.824 --> 37:00.724
Come on, baby.
The worst is over.

37:00.793 --> 37:04.024
Don't touch me!
Don't ever touch me again, bastard!

37:04.096 --> 37:06.087
Watch your language!

37:12.605 --> 37:14.402
Stella, come here.

37:14.473 --> 37:16.771
I'm never coming back
to this house.

37:16.842 --> 37:19.140
Never!

37:47.840 --> 37:49.307
DRESSI NG ROOMS

38:02.388 --> 38:04.379
Come in, Nina.

38:04.924 --> 38:07.449
I'm not Nina.
I'm Manuela.

38:10.896 --> 38:13.057
You shouldn't be here.

38:13.132 --> 38:14.895
Nina's gone.

38:14.967 --> 38:16.400
What?

38:23.442 --> 38:25.103
Where's Nina?

38:25.177 --> 38:28.112
I don't know.
I just saw her run out.

38:31.684 --> 38:34.983
She said she'd wait for me
in her dressing room!

38:35.955 --> 38:38.389
I can't believe it.

38:42.328 --> 38:44.489
It's only been two weeks.

38:44.563 --> 38:46.997
She can't do this to me.

38:52.838 --> 38:54.601
Haveyou got a car?

38:54.673 --> 38:56.436
No. Where doyou want to go?

38:58.010 --> 39:00.103
I don't know.

39:01.046 --> 39:02.274
Can you drive?

39:02.348 --> 39:03.576
Yes.

39:07.353 --> 39:10.345
Don't tell anyone,
but Nina's got problems withjunk.

39:11.724 --> 39:15.057
Doyou know where she'd go
to score at this time?

39:15.127 --> 39:17.391
No, but it's easy to find out.

39:17.463 --> 39:18.987
Thankyou.

39:19.064 --> 39:20.588
Whoeveryou are...

39:20.666 --> 39:23.692
I have always depended
on the kindness ofstrangers.

39:25.704 --> 39:27.968
I can't drive.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.803
Nina does the driving.

39:29.875 --> 39:31.934
- Want one?
- No, thankyou.

39:36.348 --> 39:39.181
I started smoking
because of Bette Davis.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.185
To imitate her.

39:41.253 --> 39:44.347
At 1 8, I was smoking
like a chimney.

39:44.823 --> 39:46.882
That's why
I called myself Huma.

39:46.959 --> 39:49.257
Huma's a very pretty name.

39:50.696 --> 39:52.960
Smoke is all there's been
in my life.

39:53.032 --> 39:55.432
You've had success too.

39:55.501 --> 39:58.095
Success has got no taste
or smell.

39:58.170 --> 40:01.367
And when you get used to it,
it's as ifit didn't exist.

40:02.374 --> 40:05.468
God, where has that girl gone?

40:36.208 --> 40:37.869
I think that's her!

40:40.813 --> 40:43.304
You stay here. I'll go.

40:53.158 --> 40:56.127
He's a son ofa bitch.
He rips everybody off.

40:56.195 --> 40:58.663
Yeah, and since I'm not
from here--

40:58.731 --> 41:00.562
Don't touch me.

41:00.632 --> 41:02.600
Listen, Nina.

41:02.668 --> 41:05.068
Huma's waiting foryou.

41:05.137 --> 41:07.264
Who the fuck areyou?

41:07.339 --> 41:08.772
She's in the car.

41:25.157 --> 41:26.647
I got everything.

41:28.394 --> 41:31.158
- Fuck, my purse!
- Yeah, I got a purse.

41:31.230 --> 41:34.393
Ecstasy, toot.

41:58.724 --> 42:01.056
- Who is it?
- It's Rosa.

42:02.428 --> 42:04.089
- Hello.
- How areyou?

42:04.163 --> 42:07.030
- Areyou alone?
- I just got up.

42:07.099 --> 42:08.430
This late?

42:08.500 --> 42:11.230
I was out late last night.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.732
- Some breakfast?
- No, thanks.

42:13.806 --> 42:17.003
- Aren'tyou hungry?
- Soyou're back on the street.

42:17.076 --> 42:20.239
Just when I'd found
anotherway foryou to earn money.

42:20.312 --> 42:22.109
Tell me.
I'm not a whore.

42:22.181 --> 42:25.082
I've been fucked around a lot,
but I'm not a whore.

42:25.150 --> 42:26.913
Why did you lie to me?

42:26.985 --> 42:30.079
It was Agrado's idea.
The dress was hers too.

42:30.155 --> 42:34.353
So tell me: What's this otherway
for me to earn money?

42:34.426 --> 42:36.917
I'm dying ofcuriosity.

42:36.995 --> 42:39.520
How much would you charge
to rent me a room?

42:39.598 --> 42:41.862
To rentyou a room?
Why?

42:41.934 --> 42:44.528
I'm going to leave the center
for a few months.

42:44.603 --> 42:47.197
What about El Salvador?

42:47.272 --> 42:49.797
I don't feel well.

42:49.875 --> 42:52.002
I can't travel like this.

42:52.077 --> 42:55.979
Why doyou want to move in here
ifyou're ill?

42:58.617 --> 43:01.245
I'm pregnant.

43:02.254 --> 43:04.381
Pregnant?

43:04.456 --> 43:06.219
What areyou going to do?

43:06.291 --> 43:09.055
Have it, ofcourse.
What doyou expect?

43:09.128 --> 43:11.528
I thought it'd be
less ofa scandal here.

43:11.597 --> 43:13.724
Can't the father
helpyou out?

43:13.799 --> 43:16.324
The father!
God knows where he is.

43:16.401 --> 43:18.733
Butyou know who he is,
don'tyou?

43:18.804 --> 43:21.602
Ofcourse.
Who doyou take me for?

43:21.673 --> 43:23.402
I'm sorry.

43:23.842 --> 43:26.106
It was your compatriot Lola.

43:30.516 --> 43:32.882
That lousy, fucking bitch!

43:35.254 --> 43:37.586
What's come overyou?

43:39.224 --> 43:41.624
What's come over me?

43:41.793 --> 43:43.454
How far along areyou?

43:44.496 --> 43:46.987
Three months, I think.

43:47.065 --> 43:48.589
But I'm veryworried.

43:48.667 --> 43:50.658
Worried?
I'm not surprised!

43:52.771 --> 43:54.534
I had bleeding this morning.

43:54.606 --> 43:55.766
Haveyou seen a doctor?

43:58.510 --> 44:01.240
I'm going
to the Hospital del Mar tomorrow.

44:01.313 --> 44:03.440
I wanted to know
ifyou'd come with me.

44:04.082 --> 44:05.606
Yes, ofcourse.

44:05.684 --> 44:07.811
Thankyou.

44:09.221 --> 44:11.280
What about the room?

44:12.257 --> 44:14.122
I'm sorry.

44:14.193 --> 44:16.753
You can't stay here.

44:37.382 --> 44:39.077
Good evening.
May I come in?

44:39.151 --> 44:41.381
Hello!
I was expecting you.

44:41.453 --> 44:43.421
I didn't know
where to send your purse.

44:43.488 --> 44:44.978
Here it is.

44:45.057 --> 44:46.786
Thankyou.

44:50.696 --> 44:52.095
Is everything there?

44:52.164 --> 44:54.758
Yes, everything.

44:54.833 --> 44:56.630
- Thankyou for last night.
- Not at all.

44:56.702 --> 44:59.136
I'd love to talk more,
but I'm short on time.

44:59.204 --> 45:01.365
- Can I helpyou?
- Could you button this?

45:01.440 --> 45:02.873
Ofcourse.

45:02.941 --> 45:04.772
What was your name?

45:06.545 --> 45:08.479
Would you like
to work for me?

45:08.547 --> 45:11.710
- Doing what?
- Everything.

45:11.783 --> 45:15.219
Everything except sleep with me.
I've got enough with Nina.

45:15.287 --> 45:18.381
Well, the truth is
I was looking for ajob.

45:18.457 --> 45:22.325
I need a personal assistant.
Someone I can trust.

45:22.394 --> 45:26.125
- You don't know me.
- What I saw last night was enough.

45:26.198 --> 45:28.063
But Nina hates me.

45:28.133 --> 45:31.296
Nina hates everyone,
including herselfand me.

45:31.370 --> 45:33.133
Well...

45:34.506 --> 45:36.235
when do I start?

45:36.308 --> 45:38.868
- Right now, ifyou can.
- All right.

45:41.213 --> 45:43.340
Ask Nina what she wants
for dinner.

45:43.415 --> 45:46.145
- I'll just have an esqueixada.
- Anything else?

45:46.218 --> 45:49.984
Could you get a tranquilizer for Nina?
She's real edgy today.

45:50.055 --> 45:53.684
- I've got Lexatin.
- Terrific!

46:17.616 --> 46:19.811
Don't mention the father.

46:19.885 --> 46:22.319
Why doyou dislike Lola so much?

46:22.387 --> 46:24.321
Lola's got the worst ofa man...

46:24.389 --> 46:26.289
and the worst ofa woman.

46:27.693 --> 46:29.558
I'll tell you a story.

46:30.896 --> 46:34.059
I had a friend
who got married veryyoung.

46:34.132 --> 46:36.327
After a year, her husband
went to work in Paris...

46:36.401 --> 46:39.268
and he was to call her
when he got settled.

46:39.471 --> 46:41.132
Twoyears passed.

46:41.206 --> 46:45.006
The husband saved some money
and came to Barcelona to open a bar.

46:45.344 --> 46:47.812
She came here tojoin him.

46:47.879 --> 46:50.245
Twoyears isn't a long time...

46:51.049 --> 46:53.540
but the husband had changed.

46:53.618 --> 46:55.950
He didn't love her anymore.

46:56.021 --> 46:58.512
The change was more physical.

46:58.590 --> 47:01.684
He'd gotten a pair oftits
that were bigger than hers.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.990
Oh, I see.

47:05.497 --> 47:08.295
My friend was veryyoung.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.998
She was in a foreign land.

47:11.069 --> 47:13.663
She had no one.

47:14.639 --> 47:17.665
Apart from the tits,
the husband hadn't changed that much...

47:17.743 --> 47:21.338
so she ended up accepting him.

47:23.215 --> 47:27.413
Women will do anything
to avoid being alone.

47:27.486 --> 47:30.819
Women are more tolerant,
but that's good.

47:30.889 --> 47:33.050
We're assholes...

47:33.125 --> 47:34.820
and a bit lesbo.

47:36.161 --> 47:38.129
Listen to the end
ofthe story.

47:38.697 --> 47:41.222
My friend
and her husband with the tits...

47:41.299 --> 47:44.496
set up a bar here,
on the Barceloneta.

47:45.337 --> 47:49.467
He spent the day in a tiny bikini,
screwing everything he could...

47:49.541 --> 47:51.509
and giving her a hard time
ifshe wore a bikini...

47:51.576 --> 47:54.101
or even a miniskirt.

47:54.179 --> 47:55.874
The bastard!

47:55.947 --> 47:59.542
How could someone act so macho
with a pair oftits like that?

48:06.558 --> 48:08.549
Sit down.

48:08.627 --> 48:11.118
- Who is the patient?
- She is.

48:11.196 --> 48:12.493
Well?

48:14.900 --> 48:16.561
My sister is pregnant.

48:16.635 --> 48:19.798
We reckon she's about
three months along.

48:19.871 --> 48:22.499
This is her first checkup.

48:23.008 --> 48:24.999
Yesterday and today
I bled a little.

48:26.111 --> 48:29.603
Lie down on the couch,
and strip from the waist down.

48:30.348 --> 48:32.475
Don't worry.

48:35.954 --> 48:38.218
- Put this on.
- Thankyou.

48:40.525 --> 48:43.824
According to the ultrasound,
the fetus seems to be fine.

48:43.895 --> 48:45.556
Doyou live together?

48:45.630 --> 48:46.995
- No.
- Yes.

48:47.065 --> 48:48.692
Which is it?

48:48.767 --> 48:52.669
She lives with our mother,
but she hasn't told her anything yet.

48:52.737 --> 48:54.500
Is your blood pressure
usually high?

48:54.573 --> 48:56.370
Yes, I have hypertension.

48:57.809 --> 49:00.642
There's a risk ofmiscarriage.

49:01.513 --> 49:03.606
You must move
as little as possible.

49:05.217 --> 49:07.344
But I've got to do myjob.

49:07.419 --> 49:12.254
Your onlyjob now is to rest
and not do anything stupid.

49:12.958 --> 49:15.449
Tell your mother
to watch her blood pressure.

49:15.527 --> 49:18.792
She has to follow a salt-free diet
and rest.

49:18.864 --> 49:20.889
I'll tell her.

49:20.966 --> 49:24.834
Listen, Doctor, I work
with people who are high-risk...

49:24.903 --> 49:28.669
so I'd like to have
an AI DS test as well.

49:29.174 --> 49:30.664
What's yourjob?

49:31.209 --> 49:33.404
She's a social worker.

49:33.478 --> 49:35.708
When can we pick up
the results?

49:35.780 --> 49:38.248
In two weeks' time.

49:39.417 --> 49:41.647
You have to tell your mother.

49:41.720 --> 49:44.280
You need to be looked after.

49:44.356 --> 49:47.621
I found ajobyesterday,
and I'm going to be busy all day.

49:47.692 --> 49:49.683
Listen.

49:49.761 --> 49:52.286
You've no right
to ask me to beyour mother.

49:52.364 --> 49:54.389
You've already got one,
even ifyou don't like her.

49:54.466 --> 49:57.458
We can't choose our parents.
They are who they are.

49:59.604 --> 50:01.265
Oh, God!

50:02.974 --> 50:06.137
Please, don't blackmail me!

50:11.516 --> 50:14.144
Idon'tknowifI was right
to call the clinic.

50:15.153 --> 50:17.587
Whatelse couldyoudo?

50:17.656 --> 50:20.147
Ican'tbelieveher
andgo onliving withStanley.

50:20.225 --> 50:23.683
Then don't believe her.
What matters is you and your baby.

50:23.762 --> 50:25.491
What ifshe told me
the truth?

50:25.564 --> 50:26.895
Blanche?

50:26.965 --> 50:29.365
Blanche is in no shape
to tell the truth...

50:29.434 --> 50:32.198
even ifshe wanted to,
poor thing.

50:34.739 --> 50:36.730
Where is my heart?

50:36.808 --> 50:39.470
She means herjewel box.
It's heart-shaped.

50:39.544 --> 50:42.570
I think it's here somewhere.
Look, here it is.

50:44.382 --> 50:47.977
- I need a necklace.
- We'll look for it.

50:50.488 --> 50:52.683
What's the gentleman's name?

50:52.757 --> 50:54.554
Huntleigh.

50:54.626 --> 50:56.685
Did he call
while I was in the bathroom?

50:56.761 --> 50:59.924
- No.
- How strange!

51:02.867 --> 51:06.200
Why areyou looking at me like that?
Do I look awful?

51:06.271 --> 51:09.638
No, you look better than ever.

51:11.476 --> 51:14.377
- I'll look betterwith this necklace.
- Shall I helpyou?

51:17.349 --> 51:19.408
Soyou'regoingona trip.

51:19.484 --> 51:22.817
You'resolucky.
I'm green with envy.

51:25.056 --> 51:26.546
Thereheis.

51:26.625 --> 51:29.685
Thatmustbe thegentleman
who's come foryou.

51:36.668 --> 51:40.570
TWO WEEKS LATER

51:47.012 --> 51:50.038
- Second call. Fifteen minutes.
- Come in.

51:51.683 --> 51:53.776
- Aren't they hereyet?
- I don't where they are.

51:53.852 --> 51:56.650
I was at the TV studio all day.

51:57.889 --> 51:59.447
- Where's Nina?
- Wasn't she with you?

51:59.524 --> 52:01.355
I just left her at home, in bed.

52:01.426 --> 52:03.291
- In bed?
- What's wrong?

52:03.361 --> 52:06.125
I think it's food poisoning.
She was so ill this morning.

52:06.197 --> 52:08.631
Why didn'tyou tell me
when I called?

52:08.700 --> 52:10.725
We didn't want to upsetyou.

52:10.802 --> 52:12.702
- Has a doctor seen her?
- Yes.

52:12.771 --> 52:16.935
She's got gastroenteritis,
but she'll be fine tomorrow.

52:17.008 --> 52:18.202
So we cancel the show?

52:18.276 --> 52:21.245
I'd like to speak to Huma,
please.

52:21.312 --> 52:22.370
Yes, wait outside.

52:23.214 --> 52:24.374
Five minutes.

52:24.482 --> 52:26.074
All right!

52:27.652 --> 52:31.144
- Tell me the truth.
- She's bombed. She can't even speak.

52:31.222 --> 52:34.851
She went out afteryou did.
She didn't know I'd drop by.

52:34.926 --> 52:37.190
She thought I'd be with you.

52:38.296 --> 52:40.230
What do we do now?

52:43.134 --> 52:46.297
Ifit won't giveyou a heart attack,
I could do her part.

52:47.405 --> 52:50.033
I know it by heart
from hearing it over the loudspeakers.

52:50.642 --> 52:52.371
But can you act?

52:52.811 --> 52:56.406
I can lie verywell,
and I'm used to improvising.

52:56.481 --> 52:57.812
I've seen that.

52:59.017 --> 53:01.110
My son said
I was a very good actress.

53:02.020 --> 53:05.285
I didn't even know
you had a son!

53:06.257 --> 53:09.283
Third call. Five minutes.

53:09.360 --> 53:11.954
Huma, what'll we do?
We can't wait any longer.

53:18.603 --> 53:20.730
Happy birthday, Blanche.

53:20.805 --> 53:22.568
This is your present.

53:22.640 --> 53:25.768
Thankyou, Stanley.
Why did you bother?

53:25.844 --> 53:27.937
I hopeyou like it.

53:28.813 --> 53:30.303
Why, it's--

53:30.381 --> 53:32.349
A bus ticket.

53:32.417 --> 53:34.317
A return ticket forTuesday.

53:35.754 --> 53:37.881
Areyou insinuating
I should leave?

53:37.956 --> 53:39.924
What doyou think?

53:46.431 --> 53:49.923
- Why did you do that to her?
- I'm sick ofher insults.

53:50.001 --> 53:53.767
I'm tired ofyou two whispering
behind my back all the time!

53:53.972 --> 53:55.701
Please, don't go!

53:55.774 --> 53:58.299
- Let go. You've torn my shirt!
- Brute!

53:58.376 --> 54:01.072
Brute?
I was a brute when we met.

54:01.146 --> 54:04.411
But I'd remind you
that it was never a problem foryou.

54:04.482 --> 54:06.814
One dayyou showed me
a picture ofyour house...

54:06.885 --> 54:09.251
a mansion with lots ofcolumns.

54:09.320 --> 54:12.619
I pulled you down offthose columns
and taughtyou to be happy.

54:12.690 --> 54:15.488
We laughed
and were happy together...

54:15.560 --> 54:18.723
until your sister Blanche
appeared.

54:18.797 --> 54:20.822
What's wrong?

54:21.966 --> 54:24.799
Take me to the hospital, please!

54:54.899 --> 54:58.300
Congratulations on last night.
I heard you were great.

54:58.369 --> 55:00.929
You can't imagine.
What a pityyou weren't there.

55:02.040 --> 55:05.373
I felt awful.
Agrado called to tell me about it.

55:05.443 --> 55:07.673
She must have called
halfof Barcelona!

55:07.745 --> 55:10.976
Areyou doing everything
the doctor told you?

55:11.916 --> 55:14.476
- I just saw him.
- And?

55:15.320 --> 55:18.653
- I went for my results.
- I forgot it was today.

55:28.833 --> 55:30.391
I'm HIV positive.

55:31.836 --> 55:33.497
We'll have the tests redone.

55:36.407 --> 55:38.932
Why the hell
did you screw Lola?

55:39.510 --> 55:42.502
Don'tyou know
she's been shooting up for 1 5 years?

55:42.814 --> 55:46.181
What world doyou think
you're living in?

55:53.057 --> 55:54.456
I don't know.

55:56.561 --> 55:58.324
Haveyou spoken
toyour mother?

56:04.402 --> 56:05.630
Your colleagues?

56:07.572 --> 56:09.802
No.

56:32.063 --> 56:35.829
We'll go foryour things now,
and you'll move in here.

56:38.036 --> 56:40.436
Thankyou.

56:51.950 --> 56:53.178
- Hello.
- Hello, Alex.

56:53.251 --> 56:56.084
You were terrific last night.

56:56.154 --> 56:58.019
Thankyou.

57:00.325 --> 57:03.453
- Good evening.
- Here's Miss GoodyTwo-shoes.

57:03.528 --> 57:05.792
- What's up?
- What's up?

57:05.863 --> 57:07.524
You planned it all, you bitch!

57:07.598 --> 57:09.293
Nina, don't be so rude.

57:09.367 --> 57:12.894
Just like Eve Harrington.
You learned the part on purpose.

57:12.971 --> 57:15.963
It's fucking impossible to learn it
over the loudspeakers.

57:16.040 --> 57:17.905
You think I'm stupid?

57:17.976 --> 57:20.570
The loudspeakers helped me
remember it.

57:20.645 --> 57:22.670
I've known the part ofStella
foryears.

57:23.014 --> 57:26.211
- Really? What a coincidence!
- Ifyou only knew.

57:26.284 --> 57:27.649
What did I tell you?

57:27.719 --> 57:29.710
Whywereyou here
that first night?

57:29.787 --> 57:31.721
Orwas that
a coincidence too?

57:32.223 --> 57:33.815
No, it wasn't a coincidence.

57:37.996 --> 57:41.796
I won't botheryou anymore.
I'll get my things and go.

57:42.166 --> 57:46.500
Manuela, I thinkyou owe us
an explanation.

57:57.081 --> 57:59.549
A StreetcarNamedDesire
has marked my life.

58:02.020 --> 58:06.354
Twentyyears ago, I played Stella
with an amateur group.

58:07.358 --> 58:09.690
That's where I met
my husband.

58:10.762 --> 58:13.788
He was playing Kowalski.

58:14.966 --> 58:18.458
Two months ago,
I sawyourversion in Madrid.

58:21.539 --> 58:24.133
I went with my son.

58:25.476 --> 58:28.639
It was the night
ofhis birthday.

58:29.313 --> 58:31.611
It was pouring rain,
but we waited outside...

58:31.682 --> 58:34.048
because he wanted
your autograph, Huma.

58:44.095 --> 58:46.256
It was crazy
to wait in the rain...

58:46.330 --> 58:49.925
but it was his birthday,
so I couldn't say no.

58:51.936 --> 58:55.702
You two got in a taxi,
and he ran afteryou.

58:58.576 --> 59:01.943
A car coming along the street
ran him down.

59:03.281 --> 59:05.841
He was killed.

59:05.950 --> 59:08.214
That's the explanation.

59:08.286 --> 59:10.982
That's the explanation, Huma.

59:27.672 --> 59:30.197
Move, Rosa.
I can't get past.

59:30.274 --> 59:32.242
What areyou doing here?

59:32.310 --> 59:34.938
Hello. I came to payyou.

59:35.012 --> 59:36.843
You leftyesterday
withoutyour money.

59:37.582 --> 59:39.106
This is my sister Rosa.

59:39.183 --> 59:41.083
- Hello.
- How areyou?

59:41.152 --> 59:42.949
Let me helpyou.

59:43.588 --> 59:45.522
Let's get the elevator.

59:45.590 --> 59:50.254
- Where's Nina?
- I left herwith Mario. She says hi.

59:53.097 --> 59:55.224
Leave the bags here.

59:58.236 --> 01:00:00.227
You go and rest for a while,
Rosa.

01:00:00.304 --> 01:00:02.670
- I'm not tired.
- Don't argue.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.033
Sit down.

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:09.668
- Anything to drink?
- No, thankyou.

01:00:10.581 --> 01:00:12.879
She's like a little girl.

01:00:16.888 --> 01:00:19.789
I couldn't sleep all night
thinking aboutyour son.

01:00:19.857 --> 01:00:22.792
I can remember his face
in the rain perfectly...

01:00:23.194 --> 01:00:25.025
and the notebook
in his hand.

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.657
I can see him now.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:31.198
I don't want to talk
about my son.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:33.197
I can't.

01:00:37.241 --> 01:00:40.574
Apart from apologizing,
Nina and and I wantyou to come back.

01:00:41.479 --> 01:00:43.709
Rosa's sick.

01:00:43.781 --> 01:00:45.942
She needs someone
to look after her all day.

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:49.475
I can't leave her.
I'm sorry.

01:00:49.554 --> 01:00:51.818
I don't know what I should do.

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:55.486
Why don'tyou check Nina
into a clinic?

01:01:01.432 --> 01:01:04.492
Ifwe don't fulfill the contract,
the companywill sue me.

01:01:05.102 --> 01:01:07.093
Find a replacement...

01:01:07.171 --> 01:01:09.162
and finish your run
with the company.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.302
I can't do the play
without Nina.

01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:16.570
She's hooked onjunk,
but I'm hooked on her.

01:01:27.425 --> 01:01:30.189
- Who was it?
- Agrado.

01:01:30.261 --> 01:01:32.058
And you let her in?

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:35.028
You should have said
we were busy.

01:01:35.099 --> 01:01:36.760
I'm thinking ofyou.

01:01:36.834 --> 01:01:40.031
Come on, lie down here
and stop moving around.

01:01:40.104 --> 01:01:41.799
What exactly
is wrong with you?

01:01:41.872 --> 01:01:43.601
An accident.

01:01:44.675 --> 01:01:46.233
What kind?

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:49.973
Why didn't I think ofit before?
Agrado could take my place.

01:01:50.047 --> 01:01:51.036
Ofcourse!

01:01:51.115 --> 01:01:53.083
The oneyou didn't want
to let in?

01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:56.952
That's something between us,
but she's perfect foryou.

01:02:01.993 --> 01:02:03.824
How old is Agrado?

01:02:03.894 --> 01:02:07.022
Pretty old.
Between thirty and fifty.

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:08.622
Is Agrado her real name?

01:02:08.699 --> 01:02:11.429
No, it's a stage name.
Like Huma.

01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:15.001
You know why
I took the name Huma?

01:02:15.072 --> 01:02:16.505
Yes.

01:02:16.574 --> 01:02:18.064
Manuela told me.

01:02:19.143 --> 01:02:20.974
What else did she tell you?

01:02:21.045 --> 01:02:23.275
Everything.
She told me everything.

01:02:23.347 --> 01:02:25.144
Aboutyou and Nina...

01:02:25.216 --> 01:02:27.207
thejunk...

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:29.276
and that it'll end badly.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.320
Really?
And what else did she say?

01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:33.880
I'm very curious.

01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:36.050
That as an actress,
you're wonderful...

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.992
but that as a person,
you're very mixed up.

01:02:44.068 --> 01:02:45.433
And what else?

01:02:48.906 --> 01:02:50.601
That I shouldn't say anything.

01:02:52.443 --> 01:02:54.434
What haveyou got
in the bag?

01:02:54.512 --> 01:02:56.673
- Cava and ice cream.
- What for?

01:02:56.747 --> 01:02:59.181
To celebrateyour success
last night, bitch.

01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:01.184
Thankyou. Come in.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.254
Oh, what a surprise!

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:10.817
Three single girls
in an empty house...

01:03:10.895 --> 01:03:13.261
always reminds me of
How To MarryA Millionaire.

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:15.731
- How areyou, Sister Rosa?
- Huma, this is Agrado.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.700
My pleasure. I'm ''fans.''

01:03:17.768 --> 01:03:18.996
How areyou?

01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:22.699
Huma, you're a goddess,
a living legend.

01:03:22.773 --> 01:03:24.866
Like I said, I'm ''fans,''
in the plural...

01:03:24.942 --> 01:03:28.400
but my Manuela was too much
the other night.

01:03:28.479 --> 01:03:32.074
How I bawled
at the evening show!

01:03:32.817 --> 01:03:34.808
Shouldn'tyou be
in El Salvador?

01:03:34.885 --> 01:03:37.718
Yes, but I'm not going now.
I'm staying here.

01:03:37.788 --> 01:03:40.222
Agrado, I don't work
for Huma anymore.

01:03:40.291 --> 01:03:44.318
Beforeyou came, we were saying
thatyou could take my place.

01:03:44.929 --> 01:03:46.396
Me play Stella?

01:03:46.464 --> 01:03:48.455
I see myselfmore as Blanche.

01:03:49.967 --> 01:03:52.299
Replacing me, not Nina,
and much less Huma.

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:54.599
Thankyou, Manuela,
but I don't--

01:03:54.672 --> 01:03:57.402
Try her for a few days.
She isn't as clueless as she seems.

01:03:57.475 --> 01:04:01.002
I am, Huma, and worse.
Right now, I don't get this at all.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.540
So I'll giveyou the bottle
to cheer us up a bit.

01:04:05.616 --> 01:04:06.742
I brought ice cream.

01:04:06.817 --> 01:04:10.810
Come on, let's have a drink
and relax a bit.

01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:12.150
I'll get the glasses.

01:04:16.694 --> 01:04:19.322
I'll just have some ice cream.
I can't drink alcohol.

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:21.024
Well, I'll have a drink.

01:04:21.098 --> 01:04:25.262
Hey, what's up with Manuela?
She seems very odd.

01:04:25.336 --> 01:04:27.930
Success hasn't gone
to her head already, has it?

01:04:29.273 --> 01:04:31.207
She wants to dumpyou
on Huma.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.680
I think Prada
is ideal for a nun.

01:04:38.749 --> 01:04:42.048
My problem is everything suits me,
so I'm very eclectic.

01:04:42.119 --> 01:04:44.417
I've had chilblains
since I came to Barcelona.

01:04:44.488 --> 01:04:45.887
Oh, really?

01:04:45.956 --> 01:04:48.220
It's finished.
Should I get more?

01:04:48.292 --> 01:04:50.760
I'd love some, but no.

01:04:50.828 --> 01:04:52.921
- Where's the bathroom?
- Straight ahead.

01:04:53.998 --> 01:04:55.590
Excuse me.

01:04:57.935 --> 01:05:01.803
Fill me in on what's happening here.
I'm no stranger.

01:05:01.872 --> 01:05:03.772
- I'll tell you tomorrow.
- No, don't!

01:05:03.841 --> 01:05:05.604
She can't keep her mouth shut.

01:05:05.676 --> 01:05:07.837
I know verywell
how to keep it shut.

01:05:07.912 --> 01:05:11.211
I played along like an English lady
so she wouldn't catch on.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:15.412
I'm a model ofdiscretion,
even when I'm sucking someone's cock.

01:05:15.486 --> 01:05:17.579
I've sucked a lot ofcocks
in public places...

01:05:17.655 --> 01:05:19.748
and no one's noticed,
except the person involved.

01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:23.052
It's been ages
since I sucked a cock!

01:05:28.365 --> 01:05:30.765
I love the word ''cock.''

01:05:30.835 --> 01:05:32.860
And ''prick''!

01:05:34.805 --> 01:05:36.033
I have to go.

01:05:36.106 --> 01:05:37.596
- Areyou all right?
- What?

01:05:37.675 --> 01:05:39.404
- Areyou all right?
- Better than ever.

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:42.241
Can you help her
find a taxi?

01:05:42.847 --> 01:05:45.543
I nearly forgot.
This is foryou.

01:05:45.616 --> 01:05:46.981
Thankyou.

01:05:47.618 --> 01:05:49.745
- Well, good-bye, girls.
- So long.

01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:57.017
You have to teach me
how to bark.

01:05:57.895 --> 01:06:02.093
I think I was a bit rude to Huma.
I said all sorts ofthings.

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:04.634
Really?
It doesn't matter.

01:06:04.702 --> 01:06:07.136
They're very different for sisters,
aren't they?

01:06:07.204 --> 01:06:10.367
- Are they sisters?
- That's what Manuela said.

01:06:10.441 --> 01:06:12.375
Well, ifshe says so.

01:06:12.443 --> 01:06:16.277
- I thinkyou're all bullshitters.
- You have to get to know us.

01:06:16.747 --> 01:06:18.339
Can you drive?

01:06:18.415 --> 01:06:21.282
- I used to be a truck driver.
- Really?

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:23.320
In Paris, before I got my tits.

01:06:23.387 --> 01:06:26.220
Then I gave up the truck
and became a whore.

01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:29.054
- How interesting.
- Very.

01:06:32.863 --> 01:06:34.956
A check.

01:06:35.032 --> 01:06:37.762
-1 50,000.
- How generous!

01:06:42.506 --> 01:06:44.440
What is it?

01:06:44.508 --> 01:06:47.671
Huma's autograph,
for Esteban.

01:06:47.745 --> 01:06:51.647
DearEsteban.: This is
theautograph Inevergaveyou...

01:06:51.715 --> 01:06:54.275
andnotbecause
youdidn't try.

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:00.755
Ihavebeen foolish,
casting mypearlsbeforeswine.

01:07:00.824 --> 01:07:03.691
- Youmeanme?
- Youandyour friend, Mr. Mitchell.

01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:06.787
He came toseeme
andrepeatedtheslanderyou'dtoldhim.

01:07:06.864 --> 01:07:09.560
-So I threwhim out.
- You threwMitch out?

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:13.837
He returned with a box ofroses
to beg my forgiveness.

01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:17.670
'' Forgive me,'' he said,
but some things are not forgivable.

01:07:17.741 --> 01:07:20.335
Cruelty is not forgivable.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:22.709
It is the one unforgivable thing.

01:07:24.048 --> 01:07:25.811
Well?

01:07:26.817 --> 01:07:29.581
- Areyou learning the part too?
- Ofcourse not.

01:07:29.653 --> 01:07:32.747
- You should,just in case.
- You think so?

01:07:33.757 --> 01:07:35.156
May I have some privacy?

01:07:35.225 --> 01:07:38.786
Soyou can getyour fix?
Can't wait till the end?

01:07:38.862 --> 01:07:40.659
Ifyou know, why ask?

01:07:42.132 --> 01:07:45.465
Ifyou don't want me to tell Huma,
do it in the bathroom.

01:07:45.536 --> 01:07:47.299
I don't need to see these things.

01:07:47.838 --> 01:07:49.066
All right.

01:07:49.139 --> 01:07:51.403
Keep an eye on the door.

01:07:57.181 --> 01:08:00.708
I know that when you'reyoung--
well, you're no child--

01:08:00.784 --> 01:08:02.615
you don't value these things.

01:08:02.686 --> 01:08:07.123
Butyou're cute,
nicely proportioned--

01:08:07.191 --> 01:08:09.182
kind ofsmall, but cute.

01:08:09.259 --> 01:08:10.749
You've lost weight--

01:08:10.828 --> 01:08:12.796
well, it's all the drugs--

01:08:12.863 --> 01:08:15.593
but the important thing is
you've lost weight.

01:08:15.666 --> 01:08:17.429
You've got talent--

01:08:17.501 --> 01:08:19.662
limited talent,
butyou've got it.

01:08:19.737 --> 01:08:22.205
And, above all,
a woman who loves you.

01:08:22.272 --> 01:08:24.171
And you trade it all forjunk.

01:08:24.241 --> 01:08:26.765
You think it's worth it?
Well, it isn't.

01:08:26.844 --> 01:08:28.709
It isn't worth it.

01:08:29.912 --> 01:08:33.314
I trade it for a bit ofpeace.
Come on, help me.

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:43.291
You're getting flat
as a board.

01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:46.459
Compared toyou.

01:08:49.033 --> 01:08:51.228
What a dirty habit!

01:08:52.703 --> 01:08:54.796
Haven'tyou ever thought
ofcutting it off?

01:08:54.872 --> 01:08:56.567
I'd get no work.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.006
The clients like us pneumatic
and well-hung.

01:08:59.076 --> 01:09:02.136
Rheumatic?
Guys are so odd.

01:09:02.212 --> 01:09:04.805
Not rheumatic. Pneumatic.

01:09:04.881 --> 01:09:07.316
A pair oftits as hard
as newly inflated tires...

01:09:07.384 --> 01:09:09.078
and a big dick as well.

01:09:10.554 --> 01:09:12.215
Show meyour cock.

01:09:12.288 --> 01:09:14.756
That fix didn't agree with you.

01:09:14.825 --> 01:09:16.520
Maybe I'll like it too.

01:09:16.593 --> 01:09:19.790
You've got enough problems
as it is.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:23.424
Go, you're on now.
And don't throw up on anybody.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.060
The audience loves it.
They think it's because I'm pregnant.

01:09:27.136 --> 01:09:30.197
You're not pregnant in this scene.
You've had a doll.

01:09:30.274 --> 01:09:32.174
That's right.

01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:40.816
Will you show me
your cock later?

01:09:40.884 --> 01:09:43.978
I'll show it toyou
and you can lick it.

01:09:44.488 --> 01:09:46.421
Young people will try anything!

01:09:51.662 --> 01:09:56.599
MONTHS LATER

01:10:08.011 --> 01:10:10.138
I'm going to call him Esteban.

01:10:10.214 --> 01:10:12.614
Your son?

01:10:12.683 --> 01:10:14.514
Why?

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:16.610
Afteryours.

01:10:17.454 --> 01:10:20.150
This babywill belong
to both ofus.

01:10:21.024 --> 01:10:23.390
Ifonly he did.

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.054
Ifonlywe were alone
in the world...

01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:28.428
without any commitments.

01:10:30.167 --> 01:10:32.965
You and your son,
just for me.

01:10:34.238 --> 01:10:36.399
Butyou have a family.

01:10:38.008 --> 01:10:41.239
I'm going to fixyour hair
and makeyou up a bit.

01:10:41.311 --> 01:10:44.371
- Why?
- I like to seeyou look nice.

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:46.848
And I called your mother.

01:10:46.917 --> 01:10:48.885
She's coming
to seeyou today.

01:10:48.952 --> 01:10:50.385
My mother?

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:53.514
You have a mother.
Don'tyou remember?

01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:57.427
What will I tell her?

01:10:58.095 --> 01:11:00.757
Thatyou love her--
I don't know.

01:11:04.601 --> 01:11:06.592
Come in, Huma.

01:11:07.271 --> 01:11:09.466
No, it isn't Huma.
May I come in?

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.531
Ofcourse, Mario.
Come in.

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:15.538
- You're very early today.
- Yes.

01:11:17.114 --> 01:11:20.379
- What areyou doing?
-Just a bit ofironing.

01:11:20.918 --> 01:11:22.818
Is anything wrong?

01:11:22.886 --> 01:11:25.650
I didn't sleep verywell
last night.

01:11:25.722 --> 01:11:28.748
I've been on edge all day.

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:30.919
Would you give me
a blowjob?

01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:35.665
Can'tyou all get it intoyour heads
that I'm retired?

01:11:35.732 --> 01:11:37.962
I don't wantyou to think that...

01:11:38.035 --> 01:11:40.094
but since I've been
on edge all day...

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:42.604
I think a blowjob
would relax me.

01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:45.267
You give me one.
I'm on edge too.

01:11:45.809 --> 01:11:49.040
Well, it would be the first time
I've sucked a woman's cock...

01:11:49.112 --> 01:11:51.080
but ifthat's what it takes--

01:11:51.148 --> 01:11:53.309
The whole company
is obsessed with my cock!

01:11:53.383 --> 01:11:56.284
It isn't the only one around.
Don'tyou have a cock?

01:11:56.353 --> 01:11:57.342
Yes.

01:11:57.421 --> 01:12:01.380
Do people askyou to suck their cocks
becauseyou've got one?

01:12:01.825 --> 01:12:02.814
- Do they?
- No.

01:12:02.893 --> 01:12:04.520
Well, then?

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:08.494
Look, I'll suckyou off
to showyou how open-minded...

01:12:08.565 --> 01:12:11.762
and how sensitive
I am about these things.

01:12:11.835 --> 01:12:13.803
Where's the fucking phone?

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:14.860
Hello?

01:12:24.147 --> 01:12:26.741
All right, don't worry.
I'll see to everything.

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:32.113
Shall we go to my room?
In case Huma comes--

01:12:32.189 --> 01:12:35.352
Huma can't come.
She's in the hospital, along with Nina.

01:12:35.425 --> 01:12:39.521
- What's happened?
- They nearly killed each other.

01:12:39.596 --> 01:12:41.530
Fuck!

01:12:44.334 --> 01:12:45.323
Here.

01:12:45.402 --> 01:12:47.165
We'll have to cancel
the performance.

01:12:47.237 --> 01:12:49.262
- Don't say anything.
- We have to say something.

01:12:49.339 --> 01:12:51.330
Yes, but it doesn't have
to be the truth.

01:12:51.408 --> 01:12:54.241
- I'll make something up.
- Right.

01:12:55.245 --> 01:12:57.076
And--

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:02.946
- Hello, how areyou?
- Hello.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.247
Come in.

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:13.496
- Where is she?
- There, in the bedroom.

01:13:33.617 --> 01:13:37.417
And here I was so worried,
thinking you were in El Salvador.

01:13:38.355 --> 01:13:40.585
I seeyou've learned to lie.

01:13:40.657 --> 01:13:42.921
I didn't know
how to tell you.

01:13:43.026 --> 01:13:45.017
What areyou going to do now?

01:13:45.095 --> 01:13:47.256
Leave the order?
Get married?

01:13:47.331 --> 01:13:49.629
Mom, the things you ask!

01:13:50.267 --> 01:13:52.599
One never knows with you.

01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:54.967
At least, I don't.

01:13:55.372 --> 01:13:58.535
Even this I had to learn about
through your friend.

01:14:00.911 --> 01:14:03.880
What would I have done
without her?

01:14:04.147 --> 01:14:05.307
How's Dad?

01:14:05.382 --> 01:14:07.976
Same as ever.
I don't know.

01:14:08.051 --> 01:14:09.951
Worse.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:14.515
Ifyou don't mind,
I'd rather not tell him anything.

01:14:15.859 --> 01:14:19.090
He wouldn't get it anyway.

01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:22.721
- And Sapic?
- Fine.

01:14:28.071 --> 01:14:30.505
Rosa, I don't know
what to do.

01:14:32.175 --> 01:14:33.972
What doyou expect me
to do?

01:14:35.812 --> 01:14:37.370
Nothing, Mom.

01:14:39.082 --> 01:14:42.074
You don't expect
anything from me?

01:14:43.487 --> 01:14:45.751
It isn't that.

01:14:46.256 --> 01:14:49.555
What I mean is
don't make it harder for me.

01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:06.274
Would you like anything?
I'm making tea.

01:15:06.343 --> 01:15:07.776
No, thankyou.

01:15:07.844 --> 01:15:11.712
What exactly is wrong?
I didn't understand over the phone.

01:15:11.782 --> 01:15:14.717
According to the ultrasound,
she's got placenta previa.

01:15:14.785 --> 01:15:18.118
When the time comes,
she'll need a caesarian.

01:15:18.188 --> 01:15:20.452
In the meantime,
she must have complete rest.

01:15:20.524 --> 01:15:22.355
Doyou think
I should take her home?

01:15:22.426 --> 01:15:25.953
I have to look after her father
as ifhe were a child.

01:15:26.029 --> 01:15:28.896
You're her mother...

01:15:28.965 --> 01:15:31.627
but I think
Rosa's better-offhere.

01:15:31.701 --> 01:15:34.499
That's the impression
she gave me.

01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:36.664
Ifyou need money,
just ask me.

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:40.335
- And, please, keep me informed.
- Yes. Don't worry.

01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:41.809
Thankyou very much.

01:15:41.878 --> 01:15:43.709
- I'll seeyou out.
- No, really.

01:15:47.818 --> 01:15:50.946
I don't know
what I did wrong with Rosa.

01:15:51.655 --> 01:15:54.624
Ever since she was born,
she's been like an alien.

01:15:55.192 --> 01:15:57.319
Doyou have children?

01:15:57.394 --> 01:15:59.157
Yes, one.

01:15:59.229 --> 01:16:01.959
Doyou get along well
with him?

01:16:02.999 --> 01:16:05.433
He died.

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:08.901
I'm sorry.

01:16:30.026 --> 01:16:32.392
Due to reasons
beyond their control...

01:16:32.462 --> 01:16:36.489
two ofthe actresses
who triumph daily on this stage...

01:16:36.566 --> 01:16:39.831
cannot be here tonight--
the poor things.

01:16:39.903 --> 01:16:42.599
So the show
has been cancelled.

01:16:43.373 --> 01:16:46.103
Those who wish
can get their money back...

01:16:46.176 --> 01:16:48.701
but for those who have
nothing better to do...

01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:51.838
it's a shame to waste the rare occasion
thatyou make it to the theater.

01:16:52.349 --> 01:16:53.748
Ifyou stay...

01:16:53.817 --> 01:16:57.309
I promise to entertain you
with my life story.

01:16:59.422 --> 01:17:01.617
Good-bye. I'm very sorry.

01:17:01.758 --> 01:17:05.421
IfI boreyou, you can pretend
to snore-- like this.

01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:09.523
I'll get the idea, and you certainly
won't hurt my feelings.

01:17:09.599 --> 01:17:11.328
Honestly.

01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:15.199
They call me '' La Agrado''...

01:17:15.272 --> 01:17:19.299
because I've always tried
to make people's lives agreeable.

01:17:21.077 --> 01:17:25.036
As well as being agreeable,
I'm very authentic!

01:17:25.649 --> 01:17:27.310
Look at this body!

01:17:28.785 --> 01:17:30.844
All made to measure.

01:17:31.555 --> 01:17:34.752
Almond-shaped eyes-- 80,000.

01:17:36.092 --> 01:17:37.855
Nose-- 200,000.

01:17:37.928 --> 01:17:41.489
A waste ofmoney. Another beating
the following year left it like this.

01:17:41.565 --> 01:17:44.261
It gives me character,
but ifI'd known...

01:17:44.334 --> 01:17:46.302
I wouldn't have touched it.

01:17:46.369 --> 01:17:47.495
I'll continue.

01:17:47.571 --> 01:17:51.132
Tits-- two,
because I'm no monster.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:55.508
70,000 each,
but I've more than earned that back.

01:17:55.579 --> 01:17:56.773
Silicone in--

01:17:56.846 --> 01:17:58.074
Where?

01:17:58.148 --> 01:18:00.514
Lips, forehead, cheeks...

01:18:00.584 --> 01:18:02.074
hips and ass.

01:18:02.152 --> 01:18:03.813
A pint costs about 1 00,000...

01:18:03.887 --> 01:18:06.549
soyou work it out,
because I've lost count.

01:18:06.623 --> 01:18:08.750
Jaw reduction-- 75,000.

01:18:08.825 --> 01:18:10.417
Complete laser depilation...

01:18:10.493 --> 01:18:12.984
because women, like men,
also come from apes.

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:14.724
60,000 a session.

01:18:14.798 --> 01:18:19.030
It depends how hairyyou are.
Usually, two to four sessions.

01:18:19.102 --> 01:18:23.129
But ifyou're a flamenco diva,
you'll need more.

01:18:26.643 --> 01:18:28.406
Well, as I was saying...

01:18:28.478 --> 01:18:30.844
it costs a lot
to be authentic, ma'am.

01:18:30.914 --> 01:18:33.041
And one can't be stingy
with these things...

01:18:33.116 --> 01:18:35.550
becauseyou are more authentic...

01:18:35.619 --> 01:18:38.986
the moreyou resemble
whatyou've dreamed ofbeing.

01:18:51.234 --> 01:18:53.065
I'll turn you around.

01:18:53.136 --> 01:18:55.536
- Please, be careful.
- Don't worry.

01:18:56.006 --> 01:18:58.975
We'll lift up a bit.
That's it.

01:19:00.243 --> 01:19:02.177
- Areyou all right?
- Yes.

01:19:02.245 --> 01:19:04.145
Ifyou can push it over here--

01:19:05.415 --> 01:19:07.474
- I'll put this away.
- Thankyou.

01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:09.848
- Can you manage?
- Yes.

01:19:15.458 --> 01:19:17.517
To the Hospital del Mar,
please.

01:19:18.328 --> 01:19:20.990
Can we go
through Medinaceli Square?

01:19:21.064 --> 01:19:24.227
Aren't we meeting your mother
at the hospital?

01:19:25.101 --> 01:19:28.195
- I just want to see the square.
- All right.

01:19:35.879 --> 01:19:37.608
Stop here!

01:19:39.349 --> 01:19:41.943
I played here as a child.

01:19:48.291 --> 01:19:49.724
Sapic!

01:20:02.272 --> 01:20:05.264
Come here, boy!

01:20:08.678 --> 01:20:10.839
Hello, Sapic.

01:20:12.515 --> 01:20:15.245
That dog would go
with anybody.

01:20:15.885 --> 01:20:17.682
Doyou have a dog?

01:20:18.254 --> 01:20:20.848
No, but I really like them.

01:20:20.924 --> 01:20:24.360
- How old areyou?
- Twenty-six.

01:20:25.829 --> 01:20:30.027
- And how tall areyou?
- Not very. Five six.

01:20:34.771 --> 01:20:35.863
Come on.

01:20:35.939 --> 01:20:37.873
Go on.
Go back to Dad.

01:20:37.941 --> 01:20:38.965
Come on.

01:20:39.876 --> 01:20:41.901
Good-bye, Dad.

01:20:48.952 --> 01:20:51.386
- You aren't in any pain?
- No.

01:20:52.555 --> 01:20:55.285
That's great.
Painless childbirth.

01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.553
When is she going
into surgery?

01:21:00.096 --> 01:21:01.893
In an hour and a half.

01:21:03.867 --> 01:21:07.928
I've got time to go check
on your father and come back.

01:21:08.171 --> 01:21:10.731
You don't have
to come back, Mom.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.565
I want to be here
with you.

01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:18.043
Give Dad a kiss for me.

01:21:18.114 --> 01:21:20.810
I'm keeping this one.

01:21:29.993 --> 01:21:31.255
So long.

01:21:31.327 --> 01:21:32.919
Good-bye.

01:21:36.566 --> 01:21:39.797
I hope the third Esteban
is the definitive one foryou.

01:21:39.869 --> 01:21:42.133
The third Esteban?

01:21:42.205 --> 01:21:44.400
Lola was the first...

01:21:44.474 --> 01:21:46.101
and your son, the second.

01:21:46.176 --> 01:21:49.168
Soyou knew Lola
was the father ofmy son too.

01:21:49.245 --> 01:21:51.110
Ofcourse.

01:21:51.181 --> 01:21:53.479
It didn't take a genius.

01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:55.916
Lola doesn't know
we had a son.

01:21:55.985 --> 01:21:58.215
I never told him.

01:21:58.855 --> 01:22:01.380
Did your son know?

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:03.653
No, he didn't.

01:22:05.428 --> 01:22:08.522
Let's not talk about sad things.
This is a great day.

01:22:08.598 --> 01:22:12.329
They've put Videla injail,
and your son's going to be born.

01:22:15.138 --> 01:22:17.732
- Promise me one thing.
- What?

01:22:18.908 --> 01:22:22.173
- Ifanything happens--
- What could happen?

01:22:22.245 --> 01:22:24.236
Promiseyou won't hide anything
from the child.

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:28.375
I don't have to. You can tell him
whateveryou wantyourself.

01:22:28.451 --> 01:22:30.942
Promise me.

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:33.687
Ifit makes you happier.

01:22:35.692 --> 01:22:37.250
All right.

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:39.795
I promise.

01:22:57.447 --> 01:23:01.816
We are here today
to say good-bye to our sister Rosa.

01:23:33.383 --> 01:23:36.181
Manuela, I'm so happy
to seeyou.

01:23:36.252 --> 01:23:38.015
What a pity
it has to be here.

01:23:38.721 --> 01:23:40.348
It couldn't be
anywhere else.

01:23:41.858 --> 01:23:45.555
You aren't a human being, Lola.
You're an epidemic!

01:23:46.696 --> 01:23:49.256
I was always excessive.

01:23:49.332 --> 01:23:51.732
And I'm very tired.

01:23:52.302 --> 01:23:54.031
Manuela, I'm dying.

01:23:56.105 --> 01:23:57.094
Come.

01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:02.244
I'm saying good-bye
to everything.

01:24:02.312 --> 01:24:05.804
I robbed Agrado
to pay my ticket to Argentina.

01:24:06.482 --> 01:24:09.610
I wanted to take a last look
at the town...

01:24:09.686 --> 01:24:11.244
the river...

01:24:11.321 --> 01:24:12.652
our street.

01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:17.489
And I'm happy
I can say good-bye toyou too.

01:24:18.728 --> 01:24:22.289
Now I just have to see
Sister Rosa's child.

01:24:23.032 --> 01:24:25.227
My son.

01:24:27.236 --> 01:24:30.637
I always dreamed ofhaving a son.
You know that.

01:24:31.407 --> 01:24:33.841
When I left Barcelona,
I was carrying your child.

01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:35.433
What?

01:24:37.246 --> 01:24:38.736
You mean you too-

01:24:40.316 --> 01:24:42.307
Did you have it?

01:24:42.986 --> 01:24:44.681
A beautiful boy.

01:24:44.754 --> 01:24:47.450
I want to see him.
Did you bring him with you?

01:24:47.523 --> 01:24:49.991
He's in Madrid,
butyou can't see him.

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:54.193
Even from a distance.
I promise he won't see me.

01:24:55.865 --> 01:24:57.799
It's the last thing
I ask ofyou.

01:24:58.601 --> 01:25:00.831
You can't see him.

01:25:01.537 --> 01:25:03.437
Please!

01:25:07.844 --> 01:25:11.610
Six months ago,
he was run over by a car.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:15.140
He's dead.

01:25:25.328 --> 01:25:28.991
I only came to Barcelona
to tell you.

01:25:29.065 --> 01:25:31.158
I'm sorry.

01:25:58.594 --> 01:26:00.391
The baby!

01:26:00.963 --> 01:26:02.988
Where haveyou been?

01:26:03.066 --> 01:26:04.863
Haven'tyou taken
Sapic outyet?

01:26:04.934 --> 01:26:08.097
- You weren't here.
- I'm here now.

01:26:13.242 --> 01:26:14.573
He's hungry.

01:26:14.644 --> 01:26:17.841
- The bottle's heating.
- Will you get it, please?

01:26:17.914 --> 01:26:19.438
Come here.

01:26:20.083 --> 01:26:22.677
Vicenta, don't let my husband
come in here, please.

01:26:22.752 --> 01:26:25.050
He's convinced
the baby's yours.

01:26:25.121 --> 01:26:27.089
Yes, I know.

01:26:28.658 --> 01:26:30.717
He's veryjealous.

01:26:30.793 --> 01:26:32.954
I told him
the babywas yours.

01:26:33.029 --> 01:26:34.758
I don't dare
tell him the truth.

01:26:34.831 --> 01:26:37.095
He wouldn't understand
anyway.

01:26:37.333 --> 01:26:39.597
Ifonly he were mine.

01:26:42.038 --> 01:26:43.505
What is it?

01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:45.268
Who's that woman?

01:26:45.341 --> 01:26:47.639
It's Manuela,
the new cook.

01:26:47.710 --> 01:26:50.304
She's been with us
four days.

01:26:50.379 --> 01:26:53.780
We've fixed up this room
so she can be here with her child.

01:26:53.850 --> 01:26:55.977
Remember?
I told you.

01:26:56.786 --> 01:26:59.448
- How old areyou?
- Thirty-eight.

01:27:00.089 --> 01:27:03.024
- How tall areyou?
- Five seven.

01:27:04.227 --> 01:27:05.489
All right.

01:27:05.561 --> 01:27:07.927
Nowyou can go
for a walk.

01:27:10.366 --> 01:27:12.334
Go on.

01:27:12.869 --> 01:27:14.131
Thereyou are.

01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:17.166
- The bottle, ma'am.
- Thankyou.

01:27:19.108 --> 01:27:20.769
Thankyou.

01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:23.078
No, no.
We're going to eat now.

01:27:27.450 --> 01:27:28.576
Yes?

01:27:28.651 --> 01:27:30.949
Don't tell anyone
about the antibodies.

01:27:36.058 --> 01:27:37.787
Do the nuns know?

01:27:40.463 --> 01:27:42.328
All right.

01:27:50.673 --> 01:27:54.575
ONE MONTH LATER

01:28:16.465 --> 01:28:18.262
Hello, Lola.

01:28:20.603 --> 01:28:22.400
Take him.

01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:33.679
What did the doctor say?

01:28:33.749 --> 01:28:36.377
He's fine.
You can see-- he's normal.

01:28:39.622 --> 01:28:41.783
You're with Dad.

01:28:42.758 --> 01:28:45.750
- Can I give him a kiss?
- Ofcourse.

01:28:50.967 --> 01:28:54.528
My son, I'm sorry to leaveyou
such an awful inheritance.

01:28:54.604 --> 01:28:56.037
Don't say that.

01:28:56.105 --> 01:28:59.836
There's no reason why
he should develop the disease.

01:29:13.422 --> 01:29:15.083
This is our Esteban.

01:29:18.594 --> 01:29:20.459
You called him Esteban too?

01:29:24.734 --> 01:29:26.463
Thankyou.

01:29:31.908 --> 01:29:34.138
He wanted to be a writer.

01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:39.245
This is his notebook.
He took it with him everywhere.

01:29:39.315 --> 01:29:42.216
He wrote this
the morning ofthe day he died.

01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.179
Read it.

01:29:46.689 --> 01:29:48.953
''Last night
Mom showed me a picture.

01:29:50.126 --> 01:29:52.253
Halfofit was missing.

01:29:53.162 --> 01:29:57.462
I didn't want to tell her,
but my life is missing that same half.''

01:30:00.369 --> 01:30:02.166
Keep reading.

01:30:06.776 --> 01:30:08.676
''This morning
I looked through her drawers...

01:30:08.744 --> 01:30:11.736
and found
a bundle ofpictures.

01:30:12.515 --> 01:30:14.881
Theywere all missing
a half.

01:30:15.718 --> 01:30:17.447
My father, I suppose.

01:30:20.556 --> 01:30:23.150
I want to meet him.

01:30:23.225 --> 01:30:26.592
I have to make Mom understand
that I don't care who he is...

01:30:26.662 --> 01:30:28.323
orwhat he's like...

01:30:28.397 --> 01:30:30.661
or how he behaved towards her.

01:30:32.068 --> 01:30:34.901
She can't deny me
that right.''

01:30:40.476 --> 01:30:42.137
Keep the picture.

01:30:45.881 --> 01:30:48.076
Thankyou.

01:31:03.499 --> 01:31:05.399
I don't likejust anyone
kissing the baby.

01:31:05.468 --> 01:31:07.868
Who was that woman
in the barwith you?

01:31:07.937 --> 01:31:10.565
That woman is his father.

01:31:10.639 --> 01:31:12.368
What did you say?

01:31:12.441 --> 01:31:15.376
That was his father,
and he's very ill.

01:31:15.778 --> 01:31:19.236
That monster is the one
who killed my daughter?

01:31:21.250 --> 01:31:23.775
Don't think about that,
Rosa.

01:31:35.231 --> 01:31:38.826
There are people who think
children are made in a day.

01:31:39.535 --> 01:31:43.198
But it takes a long time--
a very long time.

01:31:44.173 --> 01:31:48.633
That's why it's so awful to see
your child's blood on the ground.

01:31:49.912 --> 01:31:54.406
A stream that flows for a minute
and yet costs us years.

01:32:00.256 --> 01:32:02.690
When I found my son...

01:32:03.159 --> 01:32:06.253
he was lying
in the middle ofthe street.

01:32:16.605 --> 01:32:20.268
I soaked my hands in his blood
and licked them.

01:32:21.177 --> 01:32:23.668
Because it was mine.

01:32:26.182 --> 01:32:29.276
Animals lick theiryoung,
don't they?

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:33.983
I'm not disgusted
by my son.

01:32:35.391 --> 01:32:38.383
You don't know
what it's like.

01:32:40.596 --> 01:32:43.588
In a monstrance
ofglass and topaz...

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.766
I would put
the earth soaked by his blood.

01:32:55.678 --> 01:32:57.612
Keep kneading.

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.205
The sadness should go
intoyour hands.

01:33:00.449 --> 01:33:03.577
Work. You have to work.

01:33:04.687 --> 01:33:07.622
- You don't notice my cold?
- No, it's fine.

01:33:08.057 --> 01:33:10.389
Come on.
You shouldn't be in here.

01:33:12.628 --> 01:33:13.822
Hello.

01:33:13.896 --> 01:33:15.887
I've got a bouquet
forAgrado and Huma Rojo.

01:33:15.965 --> 01:33:18.627

01:33:18.701 --> 01:33:21.465
- You sure it's forAgrado?
- Yes, it says so.

01:33:23.606 --> 01:33:24.595

01:33:24.673 --> 01:33:26.868
Know why they call me
Agrado?

01:33:27.676 --> 01:33:30.873
I've always tried
to make life agreeable for others.

01:33:30.946 --> 01:33:32.641
Right.

01:33:37.887 --> 01:33:39.411
''DearAgrado and Huma:

01:33:39.488 --> 01:33:41.718
Running away once again
with no good-byes...

01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:44.190
though I know how much
you like them, Agrado.''

01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:47.525
Thesituation with Rosa'sparents
is unbearable.

01:34:14.456 --> 01:34:19.393
TWO YEARS LATER

01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:24.258
I'm comingback to Barcelona
aftertwoyears...

01:34:24.333 --> 01:34:26.130
but this time
I'm notrunningaway.

01:34:26.202 --> 01:34:30.161
I'mgoing toanAIDSconference
organizedby Can Ruti.

01:34:30.239 --> 01:34:34.175
My Estebanhasneutralized
the virus in record time...

01:34:34.243 --> 01:34:36.143
andthey want tostudy
his case.

01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:38.009
I'msohappy.

01:34:40.382 --> 01:34:42.373
May I?

01:34:45.621 --> 01:34:47.953
Hey, she's mine too!

01:34:49.625 --> 01:34:52.355
You look beautiful!
Your hair's gotten so long.

01:34:52.428 --> 01:34:55.522
- And so has yours.
- No, this is a wig for the play.

01:34:55.598 --> 01:34:58.123
Wait, your earring's loose.
I'll fix it.

01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.497
Learn, you animal!

01:34:59.568 --> 01:35:02.401
An animal, but who
takes care ofyou like I do?

01:35:02.471 --> 01:35:04.598
It's great aboutyour son!

01:35:04.673 --> 01:35:07.301
So he's neutralized the virus
practically overnight.

01:35:07.376 --> 01:35:10.812
Yes. Esteban's case
proves the virus can disappear.

01:35:10.879 --> 01:35:14.679
They're still trying to find out why,
but it's a miracle.

01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:17.981
I knew it.
How I prayed for that child.

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.050
Why not staywith us
whileyou're in Barcelona?

01:35:21.123 --> 01:35:22.112
Ofcourse.

01:35:22.191 --> 01:35:24.022
We're staying
with his grandparents.

01:35:24.093 --> 01:35:26.118
Rosa's mother
is looking forward to it.

01:35:26.195 --> 01:35:28.425
She's changed so much.

01:35:28.497 --> 01:35:30.761
- Third call, five minutes.
- I have to go.

01:35:34.403 --> 01:35:36.200
You've got Esteban's picture.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:38.638
Lola gave it to me
before she died.

01:35:38.707 --> 01:35:41.608
I was keeping it
until you came back.

01:35:41.677 --> 01:35:43.269
Keep it.

01:35:44.213 --> 01:35:45.976
Thankyou.

01:35:48.651 --> 01:35:50.312
And Nina?

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.088
I have to go.

01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:57.188
Nina got married.
She's back in her home town.

01:35:57.259 --> 01:35:59.921
She's got a baby too.
It's fat and horrible.

01:35:59.995 --> 01:36:02.361
Really, really ugly.

01:36:05.834 --> 01:36:07.768
