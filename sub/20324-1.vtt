WEBVTT

02:13.384 --> 02:15.845
We swap in parts from Fords...

02:16.053 --> 02:17.680
Plymouths and Cadillacs.

02:18.431 --> 02:20.349
My grandfather bought it in 1957.

02:20.683 --> 02:22.163
When he died, it passed to my father.

02:22.351 --> 02:23.811
Then my brother, and now to me.

02:23.894 --> 02:24.895
Look at this.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.814
This is an engine from a boat.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.482
- No way!
- Yeah.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.526
Whatever it takes to keep it running.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.862
This is the Cuban spirit.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.321
Your spirit.

02:34.447 --> 02:35.493
Don't ever lose that.

02:35.573 --> 02:36.615
Dom. Dom.

02:36.741 --> 02:37.783
It's your cousin.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.910
He's in trouble.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.537
Come on!

02:53.132 --> 02:55.009
You know I can't make a
living without my car.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.594
Not my problem, bro.

02:57.595 --> 03:01.265
Dominic Toretto, I heard about you.
Welcome to my island.

03:01.557 --> 03:02.957
Why you hookin' up my cousin's car?

03:03.642 --> 03:05.436
He needed money, I gave it to him.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.646
He can't pay, I take the car.

03:07.772 --> 03:08.892
I just need a few more days.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.539
"Few more days" wasn't part of the deal.

03:11.150 --> 03:14.407
Come on. You make a deal,
you gotta live up to it.

03:14.487 --> 03:17.073
You make a deal, you gonna live up to it.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.408
"Gonna" live up to it?

03:21.619 --> 03:23.162
Oh, so you're one of those types.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.690
You take everyone's ride,
and then ship it back to the States?

03:26.957 --> 03:29.001
You should show your people some respect.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.261
You watch your mouth.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.131
Now you got a problem.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.220
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.

03:39.303 --> 03:42.181
I'm really scared.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.786
You want a car, get it the right way.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.226
How?

03:45.768 --> 03:46.977
Race for it.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.146
I already own it, bro.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.482
Not that car.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.468
Mine.

03:55.486 --> 03:58.280
Dom, his car is
the fastest car on the island.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.172
Do you know what he has under that hood?

04:00.324 --> 04:02.493
He knows it doesn't matter
what's under a hood.

04:03.369 --> 04:06.372
The only thing that matters
is who's behind the wheel.

04:06.455 --> 04:07.498
You think so?

04:07.832 --> 04:09.000
I know so.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.043
Then race his car.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.589
And we ain't racing no quarter-mile, here.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.507
We race the Cuban mile.

04:19.010 --> 04:20.219
Done.

04:35.151 --> 04:39.613
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but
my car is the slowest car on the island.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.868
Was.

04:44.744 --> 04:46.787
Pull the seats, the doors, the battery...

04:47.288 --> 04:49.415
If it ain't the motor, take it off.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.417
Laughing gas?

04:51.751 --> 04:53.753
Nah, Fed. This is Cuban NOS.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.713
You guys are crazy.

04:57.715 --> 04:58.883
What are you doing?

04:58.966 --> 05:02.553
Poor man's turbo.
Pull the vacuum line and hold on.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.890
Old trick that Buster used to play,
in case of emergencies.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.893
You know that's way too much
boost for that engine.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.227
It's gonna be fast.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.687
It's gonna be a bomb.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.565
Only needs to go a mile.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.344
Are you ready for this, my family?

05:43.594 --> 05:45.721
This is Havana!

05:47.431 --> 05:49.558
Be fast.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.269
Be safe.

05:52.561 --> 05:55.856
But don't be last. Racers ready!

05:56.565 --> 05:57.817
<i>Vamonos!</i>

06:35.646 --> 06:37.982
That car belongs in the trash, bro!

07:27.698 --> 07:29.950
- Where are they going?
- I don't know. Let's go!

07:45.132 --> 07:46.133
Ghost him.

07:46.384 --> 07:47.585
<i>Sí.</i>

08:05.945 --> 08:07.738
<i>Adiós,</i> Toretto!

08:11.742 --> 08:13.077
Okay, Buster.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.246
Let's see if this works.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.380
That's impossible.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.627
Look out!

10:39.765 --> 10:40.850
A deal's a deal.

10:42.518 --> 10:43.686
You won my car.

10:45.855 --> 10:47.481
And you earned my respect.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.664
Keep your car.

11:04.749 --> 11:06.500
Your respect is good enough for me.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.215
Yo, cousin...

11:14.550 --> 11:15.926
Sorry about your car.

11:21.015 --> 11:23.517
Yours was too slow for a Toretto, anyway.

11:23.601 --> 11:26.270
Your Impala? Are you serious?

12:13.317 --> 12:14.860
Look at that smile.

12:15.403 --> 12:17.029
I love it when you smile.

12:17.113 --> 12:18.406
You make me happy.

12:19.198 --> 12:21.742
Mmm, I think this place makes you happy.

12:24.161 --> 12:25.579
It's like it speaks to you.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.461
You remember that guy,
the racer and his dad?

12:33.504 --> 12:34.759
The one with the boat
engine under the hood?

12:34.839 --> 12:35.840
Yeah!

12:35.965 --> 12:37.595
- Yes.
- Of course.

12:37.675 --> 12:40.636
I was looking at them, and I...

12:41.178 --> 12:45.349
And I couldn't help but to imagine
what you'd be like if you were a dad.

12:47.685 --> 12:50.021
No, no, no! I'm not pregnant.

12:54.150 --> 12:55.234
Is that what you want?

12:56.318 --> 12:58.696
It's not about what I
want or what you want.

12:59.488 --> 13:02.116
It's about why we haven't
asked the question.

13:29.060 --> 13:30.811
- What?
- You need a hand?

13:32.063 --> 13:33.314
Yeah, I think I do.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.400
- Sounds like you're not getting any fuel.
- Yeah?

13:36.484 --> 13:38.402
Probably the shut-off solenoid.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.459
Let's see if we can get some power to it.

13:42.907 --> 13:44.408
What brings you to Cuba?

13:46.202 --> 13:48.245
The same thing that brings
everyone else to Cuba.

13:49.288 --> 13:51.749
Culture, people, the beauty.

13:52.458 --> 13:53.834
What brings you to Cuba?

13:54.377 --> 13:56.712
- Work.
- Must be casual Friday.

13:58.547 --> 13:59.965
How's that honeymoon going, Dom?

14:05.805 --> 14:07.765
Your fuel relay is missing.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.143
I know.

14:14.772 --> 14:16.402
I love to play games.

14:16.482 --> 14:18.067
I've beaten the best of 'em.

14:19.110 --> 14:21.487
But I'm kind of in a rush,
so if you've got something to say to me...

14:21.570 --> 14:23.948
Oh, this is a very different game,
that I can assure you.

14:24.990 --> 14:29.286
This... There's something
much greater at work here.

14:30.079 --> 14:31.080
This is fate.

14:31.789 --> 14:33.416
I choose to make my own fate.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.042
Not today.

14:35.668 --> 14:38.671
Is this the road you take
to your apartment every morning?

14:38.838 --> 14:41.841
What else is different, Dom?
Was Santiago's closed?

14:42.008 --> 14:44.135
Did you have to cross two blocks
to go get your Cuban coffees?

14:44.218 --> 14:46.470
What is it, black, no sugar?

14:47.930 --> 14:48.973
Yeah.

14:49.140 --> 14:51.475
I put a lot of work into
getting you here today.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.031
Well, now that I'm here, what do you want?

14:54.437 --> 14:55.688
I want you to work for me.

14:57.356 --> 14:58.357
Work for you?

14:58.858 --> 15:01.027
Oh, I could've saved you
a lot of time, then.

15:01.485 --> 15:02.903
See, I don't work for anyone.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.409
You can't walk away from this, Dom.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.992
We're gonna have this conversation,
one way or the other.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.203
You see, that's the funny thing about fate.

15:12.121 --> 15:13.289
It's cunning.

15:13.873 --> 15:17.501
It can bring you beautiful things, and
it can also bring you moments like this.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.809
Oh, you're gonna want to work for me.

15:34.393 --> 15:38.609
You're gonna betray your brothers,
abandon your code, and shatter your family.

15:38.689 --> 15:43.194
You see, your team is about to go up
against the only thing they can't handle.

15:44.195 --> 15:45.196
What's that?

15:47.198 --> 15:48.532
You.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.787
Oh, and, Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

16:02.213 --> 16:05.383
<i>They are gonna be hitting us
with everything they got.</i>

16:05.675 --> 16:07.680
So we wanna engage with maximum speed.

16:07.760 --> 16:11.180
Neutralize their shooters,
and then move on to our objective.

16:11.347 --> 16:13.391
There's two things
I want you to keep in mind.

16:13.557 --> 16:15.980
Number one, I chose you for this squad

16:16.060 --> 16:19.939
because you are the most
fearsome warriors on the planet.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.028
And number two, you go out there,

16:22.108 --> 16:24.864
you do your job, and you take 'em down.

16:24.944 --> 16:27.196
Everyone. And I mean everyone.

16:27.947 --> 16:30.825
Mani's and pedi's at the
mall later on today.

16:35.987 --> 16:37.456
Monarchs!

17:25.253 --> 17:26.255
What?

17:30.301 --> 17:31.635
I don't wanna play anymore.

17:33.471 --> 17:35.139
All right, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go!

17:35.306 --> 17:36.307
Final two minutes.

17:36.474 --> 17:37.554
Quite the cheering section.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.021
Oh, yeah.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.648
Yeah, it's the moms.
They come out to support the kids.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.109
Except there seem to be
more moms than kids.

17:47.526 --> 17:48.652
Way more moms.

17:51.939 --> 17:54.120
Yeah. It's a big soccer town.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.326
Let's go, girls!

17:55.618 --> 17:57.244
So, your intel was spot-on.

17:57.453 --> 17:59.830
That Damocles 7 EMP weapon
that went missing in the Gulf?

18:00.122 --> 18:02.792
Arms dealers from the Liberation
Front have it in Berlin.

18:02.875 --> 18:03.918
Shit!

18:04.001 --> 18:06.757
This thing can wipe out
an entire electrical grid in a major city.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.297
No lights, no power.

18:08.464 --> 18:09.465
Instant Stone Age.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.884
Chloe, Maya,
you can't let her run by you like that.

18:11.967 --> 18:15.096
- Let's go, let's go! Cross!
- Agent Hobbs, this is a Class Four WMD.

18:15.179 --> 18:16.514
Do you have any idea what's at stake here?

18:16.597 --> 18:19.266
Yes, I know exactly
what is at stake here, okay?

18:19.350 --> 18:22.978
If the Pink Butterflies beat my Red Dragons,
that means we lose the championship.

18:24.146 --> 18:27.278
Which means I have 20 little girls who
are crying, and that's not a good thing.

18:27.358 --> 18:30.156
Which then means I have to spend
a lot of time in ice-cream shops

18:30.236 --> 18:31.987
and a lot of time at Tay Tay concerts.

18:32.530 --> 18:33.572
Tay Tay?

18:34.657 --> 18:38.077
Taylor Swift. Gotta be shittin' me.
Get it together, okay?

18:38.244 --> 18:39.245
Let's go, girls!

18:39.412 --> 18:41.706
We need you to do this.
It's a lot of lives at stake.

18:41.872 --> 18:43.432
All right, but I need to be clear here.

18:43.749 --> 18:46.460
The US government cannot sanction
this operation in any way.

18:46.711 --> 18:47.878
- You're on your own.
- Hey.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.464
If this thing goes sideways,
you don't just get burned.

18:50.631 --> 18:51.841
You go to prison.

18:52.425 --> 18:54.343
And there's nothing we
can do to get you out.

18:55.553 --> 18:56.595
Let me tell you something.

18:57.138 --> 19:02.143
The only thing that I love more
than saving lives is my daughter.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.104
So, if you don't shut up
with this government bullshit right now,

19:05.271 --> 19:09.984
and start showing some team spirit
and respect for the Red Dragons,

19:10.443 --> 19:13.821
I'm gonna have all 20 of them line up
and kick you right in the tay-tay.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.117
Go Dragons!

19:19.160 --> 19:20.244
Say it again.

19:20.411 --> 19:21.620
Go Dragons!

19:21.787 --> 19:23.748
Attaboy. Go Dragons.

19:24.081 --> 19:25.291
Go Dragons.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.752
- I'm open.
- She's open! Go, go!

19:28.044 --> 19:29.170
Yes!

19:30.671 --> 19:32.590
That is my daughter right there. Yes.

19:33.507 --> 19:34.845
Yes, come here.

19:34.925 --> 19:35.926
How did I do?

19:36.260 --> 19:37.261
Awesome.

19:37.345 --> 19:38.346
Nice job, kid.

19:42.508 --> 19:46.762
- Daddy's gotta go to work?
- Uh, yeah. Daddy's gotta go to work.

19:47.063 --> 19:49.063
Now, you're gonna need
to get a team you can trust.

19:49.815 --> 19:51.108
Oh, I already got one.

20:12.380 --> 20:13.381
<i>Hey, Dom.</i>

20:13.714 --> 20:14.715
Hey, Hobbs.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.967
<i>I got a job in Berlin
and I need a favor, brother.</i>

20:19.136 --> 20:21.806
No problem.
I'll grab the team and meet you in Berlin.

20:22.390 --> 20:24.392
<i>Thanks, man. I'll see you soon.</i>

20:50.876 --> 20:53.504
You were only supposed
to create a diversion, Roman.

20:53.587 --> 20:54.634
That was a diversion!

20:54.714 --> 20:56.474
How many of the damn
explosives did you use?

20:56.882 --> 20:58.134
I don't know, Tej.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.719
- All of it?
- Wait, all of it?

20:59.885 --> 21:01.804
Roman, Jesus Christ.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.556
We got more of your fan club ahead.

21:10.021 --> 21:11.063
They're still on us!

21:11.897 --> 21:13.337
These guys are taking this personal.

21:13.524 --> 21:16.656
Roman, we just blew up their facility
and stole their EMP.

21:16.736 --> 21:20.489
Other than your doctor's cold finger, I'd
say it's about as personal as it can get.

21:20.906 --> 21:22.033
Phase Two!

21:22.116 --> 21:24.702
Phase Two? So you just
gonna keep that to yourself?

21:24.869 --> 21:27.496
What happened to Phase One?
What about that part?

21:27.663 --> 21:29.040
Yeah. Remember the airplane?

21:29.206 --> 21:30.726
Everyone drove their cars out but you?

21:31.167 --> 21:33.002
I told you, my engine seized up.

21:33.169 --> 21:34.409
It's your balls that seized up.

21:34.462 --> 21:35.629
Just follow my lead, okay?

21:35.796 --> 21:38.215
And, Roman, whatever you do, don't think.

21:38.632 --> 21:39.633
Huh?

21:39.842 --> 21:41.010
Tej, drop it!

21:41.552 --> 21:42.720
Bombs away.

21:44.764 --> 21:45.806
Split, now!

21:50.186 --> 21:51.437
Holy...

22:06.786 --> 22:08.245
<i>Great plan, Tej.</i>

22:08.621 --> 22:10.706
But just so you know, you missed some.

22:10.915 --> 22:12.416
Oh, just wait for it.

22:25.096 --> 22:27.098
Oh, shit!

22:28.891 --> 22:30.059
I hate you, Tej!

22:32.311 --> 22:33.396
Got your ass.

22:39.652 --> 22:40.736
You good?

22:43.114 --> 22:44.573
I'll see you when it's done.

22:48.744 --> 22:49.870
All right, great job, team.

22:50.037 --> 22:51.837
Let's break off and meet me
at the safe house.

23:06.721 --> 23:07.722
A hell of a job, brother.

23:07.972 --> 23:09.974
When we get back to the base,
the beer's on me.

23:34.206 --> 23:36.000
You lost your goddamn mind, Toretto?

23:39.754 --> 23:41.339
Toretto, you put hands on that thing,

23:41.422 --> 23:44.008
you're gonna have the whole world
gunning for you, including me.

23:49.013 --> 23:52.141
I don't know what you're doing,
but you better think about this, Toretto.

23:53.142 --> 23:54.769
It ain't too late to stop this.

24:07.239 --> 24:08.532
It is now.

24:13.662 --> 24:15.706
That sumbitch just crossed us.

24:16.082 --> 24:18.129
- What?
- Wait a second, what are you talking about?

24:18.209 --> 24:19.210
Dom took the EMP.

24:19.418 --> 24:20.461
Bullshit.

24:21.504 --> 24:22.505
Where are you?

24:22.713 --> 24:23.839
<i>It's too late for me. Get outta here.</i>

24:24.090 --> 24:27.802
Saw that look in his eye,
and I've seen that look before.

24:28.636 --> 24:30.721
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.

25:32.867 --> 25:34.827
All right, I got his phone records, y'all.

25:34.994 --> 25:37.371
It's a whole bunch of calls
to untraceable numbers.

25:37.580 --> 25:38.581
Burner phones, right?

25:38.748 --> 25:39.999
Nah, scrambler.

25:40.166 --> 25:43.210
Same number, but they got some sort
of micro-router to bury the signal path,

25:43.377 --> 25:47.173
which means Dom is clearly communicating
with somebody that's above our pay grade.

25:47.423 --> 25:51.302
Look, I don't know Dom as well as you,
but if we just look at the facts,

25:51.969 --> 25:54.472
Dom's been having highly
encrypted conversations

25:54.638 --> 25:56.098
with some mysterious person.

25:57.808 --> 25:59.185
He took out Hobbs.

25:59.769 --> 26:01.520
He stole an EMP. Now he's disappeared.

26:02.396 --> 26:03.564
So, what are you saying?

26:03.731 --> 26:06.650
Maybe we should consider
the fact that Hobbs is right.

26:07.318 --> 26:09.069
Dom did go rogue.

26:10.029 --> 26:11.030
Letty.

26:11.155 --> 26:13.074
Before you judge the man,

26:13.240 --> 26:16.327
remember, you're breathing right
now because he saved your life.

26:24.669 --> 26:26.709
You just gonna let her bump
your shoulder like that?

26:27.421 --> 26:30.633
I'm just saying,
that was a little aggressive.

26:33.010 --> 26:34.878
What you gonna do, email her?

26:37.598 --> 26:38.641
Check.

26:49.777 --> 26:50.903
Moment, will you, fellas?

26:52.321 --> 26:53.614
Thank you.

26:53.781 --> 26:55.199
Well, this is an exciting new look.

26:55.741 --> 26:57.910
It's a little tight in
the crotch, as always.

26:59.286 --> 27:01.330
What boy-band bus did she fall out of?

27:01.997 --> 27:03.332
It's my new junior associate.

27:03.499 --> 27:05.418
He's working with me on this. All yours.

27:05.501 --> 27:08.262
Mr. Nobody and I have been given
the authority to get you out of this.

27:08.379 --> 27:11.298
All you have to do is agree
to the terms and you're free.

27:12.466 --> 27:14.386
What's training wheels talking about?
What terms?

27:14.927 --> 27:16.512
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.

27:16.971 --> 27:20.850
Treason, international espionage,
massive destruction of civic property.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.685
You do that, we close the case.

27:23.102 --> 27:25.229
- And?
- And the DSS blacklists you.

27:25.396 --> 27:26.731
Germany loves that.

27:26.897 --> 27:28.482
Officially, you will be a criminal.

27:28.566 --> 27:29.567
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:29.650 --> 27:31.450
You need to work on your
delivery, all right?

27:31.569 --> 27:32.945
Unofficially...

27:34.405 --> 27:36.907
You're off the books.
You come work with me.

27:38.576 --> 27:39.577
I'm not a criminal.

27:39.660 --> 27:41.162
Luke, come on. Labels.

27:41.912 --> 27:43.289
There is no confession.

27:43.706 --> 27:45.291
There are no backroom deals.

27:45.374 --> 27:47.543
I got myself into this,
I'm gonna get myself out of it.

27:47.752 --> 27:50.087
- You know that.
- I do, and that's what I told him.

27:50.338 --> 27:51.922
Well, there you have it.

27:53.257 --> 27:54.417
Good luck in the courts, man.

27:57.011 --> 27:58.012
What about your daughter?

28:00.931 --> 28:04.268
You know, if you're not gonna do it for
your country, at least do it for your kid.

28:05.135 --> 28:07.003
Big mistake, kid.

28:08.606 --> 28:10.236
Hold on. Luke, Luke.

28:10.316 --> 28:12.026
He's still working from the manual.

28:12.193 --> 28:14.111
I mean, he doesn't even
really know the rules.

28:14.987 --> 28:16.322
Now, come on, give him a break.

28:16.781 --> 28:18.616
Give me a break.

28:18.866 --> 28:19.867
Luke.

28:22.453 --> 28:23.454
Appreciate it.

28:25.122 --> 28:26.540
It's good to see you, Nobody.

28:26.707 --> 28:27.833
You, too.

28:30.628 --> 28:31.962
Rule number one...

28:33.297 --> 28:34.507
Know your audience.

28:34.674 --> 28:36.884
I gave you your shot. You shit the bed.

28:37.051 --> 28:38.969
Now I'm gonna show you
how to get this done.

28:47.812 --> 28:49.689
You're dead, cop. Dead!

28:49.855 --> 28:52.233
I'm gonna slice some bacon
off your back, pig.

28:53.693 --> 28:55.486
Well, well, well...

28:55.653 --> 28:59.407
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that.

29:00.408 --> 29:02.201
The bent cop got his day.

29:15.506 --> 29:16.882
You know, that color looks good on you.

29:17.049 --> 29:19.260
Yeah, it'll look a whole hell of a lot
better with your blood on it.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.262
Yeah, good luck with that, Hercules.

29:22.054 --> 29:23.556
Lawman gone bad, huh?

29:24.515 --> 29:25.850
Such a cliche.

29:26.851 --> 29:28.519
Oh, well, welcome to the club.

29:29.228 --> 29:31.022
I wouldn't get that twisted, son.

29:31.188 --> 29:33.190
We ain't in no club,
we got nothing in common.

29:33.274 --> 29:34.994
And unlike you, I ain't gonna be here long.

29:35.192 --> 29:36.552
What, you bring a shovel, did you?

29:36.902 --> 29:39.363
Because it's 38 feet of steel and concrete.

29:39.947 --> 29:41.157
Or so I've been told.

29:43.451 --> 29:44.702
Better get to digging.

29:46.078 --> 29:47.079
Wanker.

29:50.166 --> 29:51.250
Yeah.

30:08.559 --> 30:09.769
Move.

30:10.519 --> 30:11.979
Say that again.

30:12.605 --> 30:16.359
If I say it again, it'll be to a corpse.

30:19.653 --> 30:20.988
I'm gonna enjoy this.

30:21.489 --> 30:22.573
Welcome back, Dom.

30:23.032 --> 30:24.075
Nice job out there.

30:25.868 --> 30:27.286
You excited about tonight?

30:28.829 --> 30:29.830
You're going on this?

30:35.127 --> 30:36.420
You're with me, Dom.

30:46.389 --> 30:47.807
Showing me your shoe collection?

30:48.099 --> 30:49.100
Yep.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.313
A pair for every occasion.

30:54.480 --> 30:57.358
You have enough guns in here
to outfit a small army, huh?

30:57.525 --> 30:59.652
Oh, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

31:02.905 --> 31:05.908
You know what I like about you, Dom?
You're a genuine outlaw.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.661
I mean, you're a man
who lives by his own rules.

31:08.953 --> 31:11.542
Which is surprising,
because when I saw you in Cuba,

31:11.622 --> 31:14.917
I heard about a guy who almost
killed you with a motorcycle,

31:15.126 --> 31:17.670
and you let him keep his car?

31:18.212 --> 31:19.797
Oh, that confused you?

31:20.172 --> 31:21.173
Hmm.

31:22.967 --> 31:24.885
'Course I could've taken his car.

31:25.553 --> 31:27.179
But it's about something bigger.

31:27.888 --> 31:29.306
This way...

31:31.100 --> 31:32.101
I changed him.

31:32.309 --> 31:33.811
That's not your responsibility.

31:34.061 --> 31:35.813
- But it's who I am.
- Is it?

31:36.397 --> 31:38.997
Let me ask you something, Dom.
What's the best thing in your life?

31:40.609 --> 31:42.278
- Family.
- No, it's not.

31:44.321 --> 31:45.865
Not if you're being honest.

31:46.699 --> 31:49.410
It's the 10 seconds
between start and finish,

31:49.493 --> 31:51.328
when you're not thinking about anything.

31:51.662 --> 31:54.331
No family, no obligations.

31:54.498 --> 31:55.750
Just you.

31:56.834 --> 31:57.835
Being free.

32:03.174 --> 32:04.258
I gotta tell you,

32:04.342 --> 32:08.512
this whole saving-the-world, Robin Hood
nonsense you've been doing recently?

32:08.846 --> 32:11.265
It's bullshit. It's not you.

32:16.812 --> 32:18.439
Be who you are.

32:19.065 --> 32:21.067
Why live only a quarter mile at a time

32:21.150 --> 32:23.778
when you can live your whole life that way?

32:35.206 --> 32:36.290
Is that it?

32:36.874 --> 32:39.377
Is that all those
bloated-out muscles will give ya?

32:39.877 --> 32:41.420
All show and no go.

32:55.518 --> 32:56.602
Oh, I got plenty of go.

32:56.977 --> 33:01.315
You must've misplaced that when I kicked
your arse up and down that office of yours.

33:01.399 --> 33:02.400
Yeah.

33:04.402 --> 33:06.529
Just like you Brits,
rewriting history, huh?

33:06.737 --> 33:09.990
All I know is, it wasn't me that was
thrown out of a four-story window.

33:10.074 --> 33:11.117
Jumped.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.078
I jumped out of a four-story window,
saving my partner's life.

33:14.954 --> 33:18.290
'Cause where I'm from,
we don't settle fights by throwing bombs.

33:18.374 --> 33:22.086
Well, that's funny, because where I'm from,
we don't need women to run to our rescue.

33:22.837 --> 33:25.673
I mean, do you really believe
you can stand in front of me

33:26.924 --> 33:29.218
and beat me in a straight-up,
old-fashioned fist fight?

33:29.385 --> 33:30.594
Let me tell you something.

33:31.095 --> 33:34.932
Me and you, one-on-one, no one else around.

33:35.599 --> 33:39.729
I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum.

33:42.690 --> 33:44.108
Maybe one day we'll find out.

33:44.608 --> 33:46.985
Oh, you better hope that day never comes.

33:56.412 --> 33:59.665
I said no, Mr. Nobody.
I'm not leaving this cell.

34:00.207 --> 34:02.059
I'll get out my way.

34:02.918 --> 34:03.919
The right way!

34:08.799 --> 34:10.134
Hey! Why's the door open?
Get back in your cell!

34:10.217 --> 34:11.802
Relax. It's just a malfunction.

34:11.969 --> 34:14.204
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.

34:25.983 --> 34:27.818
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

35:01.352 --> 35:02.478
Hobbs!

35:03.979 --> 35:05.815
I've been waiting a long time for this.

35:06.982 --> 35:08.192
Keep waiting, bitch.

35:13.489 --> 35:15.700
Rubber bullets. Big mistake.

36:37.823 --> 36:39.950
Well, that took longer than I expected.

36:42.161 --> 36:43.287
<i>- Two questions.
- Yeah.</i>

36:43.537 --> 36:45.456
- My daughter?
- With your sister.

36:46.290 --> 36:47.920
Toretto?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.710
It's interesting you ask.

36:50.670 --> 36:53.214
This is my new base. Welcome to nowhere.

36:53.798 --> 36:55.632
It's a little sterile for you.

36:56.342 --> 36:58.219
Listen, there's something
I wanna talk to you about after.

36:58.302 --> 36:59.679
Hey, listen, guys. Thanks...

36:59.762 --> 37:01.931
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? Handcuffs? What is this?

37:02.139 --> 37:03.561
It's called abuse of power.

37:03.641 --> 37:04.934
You told me to round them up.

37:05.142 --> 37:06.262
I didn't tell you to hand...

37:07.311 --> 37:09.563
Cut 'em loose. Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.

37:10.022 --> 37:11.482
I'm sorry, guys, really, I...

37:12.316 --> 37:13.836
So, this is how you treat old friends?

37:13.984 --> 37:17.321
Friends? We don't even really know
who the hell this guy is.

37:17.488 --> 37:19.608
Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?

37:19.824 --> 37:21.033
Nobody. So, then, who is he?

37:21.200 --> 37:22.960
Him? He's nothing. He's,
like, less than me.

37:22.993 --> 37:25.996
Clearly, we're getting nowhere with nobody.

37:26.497 --> 37:29.000
I've been in here for four hours,
and my ribs are showing.

37:29.667 --> 37:31.836
I don't know about y'all, but I'm out.

37:33.337 --> 37:34.922
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?

37:35.006 --> 37:37.508
Well, thanks to your botched Berlin job,

37:37.591 --> 37:39.844
you all made Interpol's
Top 10 Most Wanted list.

37:40.011 --> 37:41.178
- Top 10.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:41.887 --> 37:42.888
That's all right.

37:42.972 --> 37:45.645
- Well, not you, Roman.
- What do you mean?

37:45.725 --> 37:48.102
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...

37:48.185 --> 37:50.271
- I'm... I missed?
- Yeah.

37:50.855 --> 37:51.897
That's impossible!

37:52.606 --> 37:53.886
What number did they come in at?

37:55.026 --> 37:58.237
Six, eight, nine, ten.

37:59.363 --> 38:00.451
- She's 10?
- Mmm-hmm.

38:00.531 --> 38:02.658
That's impossible. There's
no way she's a 10.

38:02.825 --> 38:04.535
Oh, she's definitely a 10.

38:05.494 --> 38:09.498
How about we focus on someone who
we're not gonna find on anybody's list.

38:09.665 --> 38:11.459
We're awaiting hard confirmation,

38:11.542 --> 38:15.379
but I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.

38:16.172 --> 38:19.383
Wait, no. Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.

38:19.675 --> 38:20.835
Not according to our sources.

38:20.926 --> 38:22.011
What does she want?

38:22.136 --> 38:23.220
No one knows.

38:23.554 --> 38:25.473
Cipher is like a digital act of God.

38:25.931 --> 38:29.935
They... Well, she can manipulate
world systems from the shadows.

38:30.019 --> 38:31.691
Anything that can be hacked
is hers to play with.

38:31.771 --> 38:35.399
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.

38:35.524 --> 38:38.778
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds, worldwide.

38:38.861 --> 38:40.221
So, basically, she's the bogeyman.

38:40.363 --> 38:43.449
Damn, she's one of the hottest
bogeymans I've ever seen.

38:43.741 --> 38:47.010
I mean, if y'all know her,
tell her to get at your boy.

38:48.537 --> 38:50.457
- What are you, 12?
- That was my shin, mother...

38:50.581 --> 38:54.251
Let's just say, people are scared
of the hacker group Anonymous.

38:54.418 --> 38:55.840
But even Anonymous won't mess with her.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.339
What the hell does
any of this have to do with us?

38:58.422 --> 39:01.053
Probably nothing, Letty,
but I do find it interesting that,

39:01.133 --> 39:04.929
apparently, for some reason,
she's now working with this guy.

39:20.403 --> 39:24.031
He's already delivered a fully
operational EMP into her hands.

39:24.407 --> 39:28.285
Detonate that, they can turn any city
in the world into a war zone.

39:28.703 --> 39:31.163
So, then, what is it
you're suggesting we do?

39:31.247 --> 39:32.415
Maybe we find Dom, huh?

39:32.581 --> 39:35.668
Well, first, let's catch him,
and then figure out why he's turned.

39:36.127 --> 39:38.838
So, y'all want us to track Dom.

39:39.005 --> 39:41.215
Yeah, I know, Roman,
it's kind of a big job.

39:41.674 --> 39:42.758
It's impossible.

39:42.925 --> 39:47.221
Which is why I'm bringing in
an extra pair of hands.

39:53.394 --> 39:55.813
Ah, my day just got
a whole hell of a lot better.

39:55.980 --> 39:57.300
Mr. Nobody, you wanna tell me why

39:57.356 --> 40:01.819
you just put me in a room with this
tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?

40:01.902 --> 40:06.285
What a big mouth on a small head,
coming from Prisoner 6753.

40:06.365 --> 40:08.454
Don't think we've forgotten
everything that you've done.

40:08.534 --> 40:10.957
We are not teaming up with this guy.

40:11.037 --> 40:13.622
Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.

40:14.081 --> 40:17.335
I don't care about you,
your crew, or your little family.

40:17.710 --> 40:18.798
I'm here for Cipher.

40:18.878 --> 40:20.958
What are you gonna do,
apply for a job? Head Asshole?

40:20.963 --> 40:23.924
You know, I think that tight T-shirt's
cutting off the circulation to your brain.

40:24.008 --> 40:25.259
You should get a bigger size.

40:25.968 --> 40:29.475
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.

40:29.555 --> 40:31.057
When I said no, she went after my brother.

40:31.140 --> 40:34.352
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?

40:35.019 --> 40:37.483
Former hell-raiser and current guest

40:37.563 --> 40:40.149
at a nasty little black site prison.

40:40.566 --> 40:42.488
Cipher corrupted him and left him for dead.

40:42.568 --> 40:45.157
So, if I get a shot to take her down,
believe me, Flex, I'm taking it.

40:45.237 --> 40:47.159
You're taking my boot right up your ass,
is what you're taking.

40:47.239 --> 40:49.996
Guys, guys. The fastest way
to find Cipher is through Toretto.

40:50.076 --> 40:52.456
Now, aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world

40:52.536 --> 40:54.872
that have ever managed to actually
track him down with any success.

40:55.039 --> 40:57.837
And guess what. They're both
standing in front of me right now.

40:57.917 --> 41:00.920
So, like it or not,
you two are gonna work together.

41:01.921 --> 41:03.089
You got that?

41:06.008 --> 41:07.218
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

41:08.552 --> 41:10.012
Am I the only one seeing this?

41:10.805 --> 41:12.623
Oh, this ought to be good.

41:15.393 --> 41:16.519
Use God's Eye.

41:17.103 --> 41:18.562
We put our lives on the line,

41:18.646 --> 41:21.482
running around the world
trying to figure this thing out.

41:21.565 --> 41:22.942
It can find anybody, right?

41:23.567 --> 41:25.069
Let's use it to find Dom.

41:25.403 --> 41:28.406
Roman, that is a great idea.

41:29.365 --> 41:31.784
Did you hear that? "Great idea."

41:32.201 --> 41:33.601
No, no, no, don't tune it out. Huh?

41:33.994 --> 41:35.871
Mr. Nobody, let's fire it up, huh?

41:47.258 --> 41:48.926
Got him. He's in London.

41:51.178 --> 41:52.179
Yeah.

41:54.932 --> 41:58.269
Wait. We've got a second
match in Hong Kong.

41:58.436 --> 42:00.980
Beijing and Seoul.

42:01.063 --> 42:02.565
And Tokyo.

42:04.191 --> 42:06.986
And just about every
other major city on the planet.

42:07.069 --> 42:10.573
And so, God's Eye was where we started.

42:10.698 --> 42:12.533
But Cipher's already created an evasion

42:12.616 --> 42:16.704
that masks their location by pinging
random spots all over the globe,

42:16.787 --> 42:18.372
but it was a good thought, Roman.

42:19.749 --> 42:21.375
So, she's made my program obsolete.

42:21.459 --> 42:23.794
And that, Ramsey, is why you're here.

42:24.295 --> 42:26.797
See, simple solutions
aren't gonna cut it here, slick.

42:29.133 --> 42:30.613
Why you look at me when you say that?

42:31.010 --> 42:33.721
Wait a second. Wait, wait.
Simple solutions might just cut it.

42:34.138 --> 42:37.436
You see, in order for God's Eye
to give off all these false pings,

42:37.516 --> 42:39.435
means they have to be using a FLEA relay.

42:39.643 --> 42:40.686
Watch these two.

42:40.770 --> 42:42.855
Which means it has
a decaying sync randomizer.

42:42.938 --> 42:44.110
Which we can reverse...

42:44.190 --> 42:48.277
And track it back to the originating source
and find Dom's true location.

42:49.445 --> 42:50.765
I'm telling you, they got skills.

42:51.155 --> 42:52.365
That was my idea.

42:52.907 --> 42:54.627
That's what I was saying.
Remember in there?

42:54.658 --> 42:56.243
All right, let's try this.

43:06.837 --> 43:07.838
It's working.

43:08.297 --> 43:11.509
Time you wanna check your manual
and start organizing a force response.

43:12.510 --> 43:13.844
Let's get a hold of
our international assets...

43:13.928 --> 43:15.346
He's still green.

43:15.429 --> 43:17.264
Yeah, like fresh baby shit.

43:17.348 --> 43:19.934
As soon as we have Toretto's location,
I want to mobilize.

43:22.520 --> 43:25.147
Let's get a hold of a better asshole.

43:25.272 --> 43:27.441
No one respects you... Cover.

43:27.608 --> 43:28.609
Get away from me.

43:29.360 --> 43:30.640
All right, they're not in China.

43:32.029 --> 43:33.030
Or Russia.

43:34.490 --> 43:35.616
Europe's clear.

43:37.201 --> 43:38.953
But this one's not going away.

43:40.621 --> 43:41.664
This is interesting.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.041
Why?

43:46.043 --> 43:47.253
Because that's here.

44:27.835 --> 44:29.340
Did you all enjoy that?

44:29.420 --> 44:31.756
Next-generation concussion grenade.

44:32.048 --> 44:37.136
It scrambles your senses.
Don't worry, it'll wear off in an hour.

44:37.719 --> 44:39.304
Probably.

44:39.472 --> 44:41.682
Hello, Deckard. Nice to see you again.

44:44.560 --> 44:47.396
Look at this, body's not even cold, Dom.

44:47.688 --> 44:49.940
Your family's already replacing you.

44:51.859 --> 44:53.778
You chose the losing team.

44:54.945 --> 44:57.531
I guess your brother is smarter than you.

45:31.565 --> 45:34.068
Smart move, embedding God's Eye
into the mainframe.

45:34.527 --> 45:37.822
Irritating to make me have to come
all the way down here to get it, but...

45:41.450 --> 45:42.576
Let's go.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.459
Dom!

45:59.510 --> 46:02.972
You're gonna turn your back
on family? Just like that?

46:38.466 --> 46:39.967
Let's go.

47:13.250 --> 47:14.418
You okay?

47:17.922 --> 47:18.923
That wasn't him.

47:22.802 --> 47:27.390
I don't know what she's got on him,
but that wasn't Dom.

47:29.183 --> 47:30.521
Brian would know what to do.

47:30.601 --> 47:31.727
No!

47:35.648 --> 47:38.067
We can't bring Brian and Mia into this.

47:38.609 --> 47:40.027
We agreed on that.

47:42.488 --> 47:43.572
I know.

47:51.622 --> 47:56.293
Back there, was that for
her, for me, or you?

47:57.294 --> 47:59.714
And was it even necessary?

48:00.548 --> 48:02.550
Necessary?

48:02.717 --> 48:04.135
Nothing is necessary.

48:04.301 --> 48:06.470
Everything is a choice.

48:06.637 --> 48:08.973
And I simply made one. But so did you.

48:09.181 --> 48:11.308
You could've stopped me,
but you chose not to.

48:11.517 --> 48:13.686
I wonder what Letty thought about that.

48:16.230 --> 48:18.524
The problem with putting
your foot on a tiger's neck

48:18.691 --> 48:20.151
is you can never let it up.

48:20.651 --> 48:24.947
I think I need to remind you
why you chose to be here.

48:51.849 --> 48:53.017
Elena.

49:00.358 --> 49:01.484
Dom?

49:08.366 --> 49:09.867
I'm sorry.

49:12.536 --> 49:13.662
You shouldn't have come.

49:14.747 --> 49:16.874
Nothing could have kept me away.

49:17.041 --> 49:18.584
Now she has the three of us.

49:25.216 --> 49:27.009
Do you wanna see him?

49:31.263 --> 49:32.956
See Papa?

49:35.101 --> 49:36.519
See Papa.

49:40.398 --> 49:41.732
Papa.

49:51.742 --> 49:55.871
When I realized I was pregnant,
you had just found out Letty was alive.

49:57.790 --> 50:00.918
So I decided when Letty and you got
back from your honeymoon,

50:01.085 --> 50:02.920
I was going to tell you.

50:05.214 --> 50:08.342
But then she took us
before I had the chance.

50:13.431 --> 50:14.598
His name?

50:17.393 --> 50:19.186
I call him Marcos.

50:20.730 --> 50:22.732
But that's his middle name.

50:23.899 --> 50:27.445
I thought his father
should give him his first name.

50:36.412 --> 50:38.456
I'm sorry, Dom.

50:39.582 --> 50:41.751
There's nothing to be sorry for.

50:44.545 --> 50:45.796
Whatever happens,

50:47.631 --> 50:49.592
just save our son.

50:53.471 --> 50:55.222
Your son.

51:15.993 --> 51:17.745
Good visit?

51:19.997 --> 51:22.667
I know. I know what you're thinking.

51:24.335 --> 51:28.172
I just let the guards go, so there's
only two opponents in the room.

51:28.506 --> 51:31.509
Rhodes has the gun,
so you'll take him out first.

51:31.676 --> 51:32.802
I know you.

51:33.135 --> 51:36.305
And then you're thinking, Elena's a cop.

51:36.472 --> 51:39.684
Maybe the two of you
can fight your way out of here.

51:39.850 --> 51:42.519
So much to think about.

51:47.650 --> 51:49.527
Let me make it easier for you.

51:56.242 --> 51:58.119
Do with it as you wish.

52:06.168 --> 52:08.379
Have you heard of Choice Theory, Dom?

52:08.713 --> 52:10.214
There is a bunch of axioms,

52:10.381 --> 52:13.050
but only two you really need
to concern yourself with.

52:13.217 --> 52:17.888
One, the only person's behavior
we can control is our own.

52:18.055 --> 52:22.309
And, two, the only thing we can truly give
another person is information.

52:22.476 --> 52:24.395
So, let me give you some.

52:25.479 --> 52:26.939
You see these cameras in here?

52:28.566 --> 52:31.485
The moment you make a move,
highly-paid men with weapons

52:31.652 --> 52:33.988
will make their way into this room

52:34.071 --> 52:36.615
with one very specific instruction.

52:37.324 --> 52:38.951
It's not to save me.

52:40.619 --> 52:42.455
It's to kill your son.

52:43.748 --> 52:45.791
Now, that's a lot of bullets,

52:45.958 --> 52:48.627
and it only takes one
for you to lose everything.

52:48.794 --> 52:51.422
So, I have to ask you,

52:51.589 --> 52:54.884
because I know family
is so important to you.

52:57.636 --> 53:00.514
Is that really a choice you want to make?

53:04.060 --> 53:06.103
Because I'm ready if you are.

53:09.815 --> 53:12.943
If I pull this trigger,
and God knows I want to,

53:13.944 --> 53:18.699
if I killed everyone on this plane,
I still couldn't get in there.

53:19.700 --> 53:22.536
'Cause of your two-man fail-safe system.

53:23.579 --> 53:25.247
Since I'm alone,

53:27.833 --> 53:30.086
I got no choice!

53:38.844 --> 53:41.013
I didn't think so.

54:11.794 --> 54:14.130
You want to see the old Dom?

54:16.465 --> 54:17.675
Watch.

54:27.059 --> 54:28.185
Bitch.

54:29.729 --> 54:31.689
- Don't, don't.
- Sweet dreams.

54:31.856 --> 54:33.024
Please!

54:36.777 --> 54:37.862
Damn it.

54:38.529 --> 54:40.740
She wiped it all. Took God's Eye.

54:41.574 --> 54:44.243
That was the one thing
we could use to find them.

54:44.410 --> 54:45.703
We lost everything.

54:48.039 --> 54:49.079
What do you got, Princess?

54:50.291 --> 54:52.001
Finding Toretto.

54:52.460 --> 54:54.211
But I got a couple of minutes to spare,

54:54.378 --> 54:57.089
if you want me to send you
to the hospital. Again.

54:58.423 --> 55:01.135
- Yo, Rules.
- First off, that's not my name.

55:01.427 --> 55:03.304
- Little Nobody.
- Don't call me that.

55:03.471 --> 55:04.472
Oh, that's definitely sticking.

55:04.555 --> 55:07.687
Great. Do me a favor and tell Your Majesty
over there that we're gonna find Toretto.

55:07.767 --> 55:09.518
We find Toretto together as a team.

55:09.602 --> 55:10.842
And when this is all over with,

55:10.978 --> 55:13.356
I'm happy to slap that
whisker biscuit right off his face.

55:13.522 --> 55:15.733
Wait a minute, guys,
I think Deckard's actually onto something.

55:15.900 --> 55:19.528
How do you think Dom and Cipher
got into the country without us knowing?

55:20.404 --> 55:21.447
Ghost flights.

55:21.572 --> 55:24.450
I thought untraceable aircraft
was all Internet conspiracy stuff.

55:24.533 --> 55:25.576
It's not.

55:25.701 --> 55:29.413
Satellites and radar grids
all across the globe

55:29.580 --> 55:31.665
shift like an ocean.

55:31.832 --> 55:33.959
They've got channels that open and close.

55:34.126 --> 55:37.206
And theoretically, if you know the right
people who know the right patterns...

55:37.505 --> 55:40.025
You can fly right through the blind
spots completely undetected.

55:40.758 --> 55:42.468
So you know where Dom is headed?

55:43.844 --> 55:46.430
Yeah. New York.

55:48.766 --> 55:49.934
You see there, Luke?

55:50.101 --> 55:52.144
You guys are gonna get along just great.

55:52.353 --> 55:56.107
Which proves rule number two,
you never lose everything.

55:56.273 --> 55:57.483
Fire up the chopper.

55:57.650 --> 56:00.111
Well, guys, have a ball in the Big Apple.

56:23.175 --> 56:25.219
<i>And why are we traveling like this again?</i>

56:25.386 --> 56:28.973
<i>Because Dom took God's Eye,
so we need to stay off the grid.</i>

56:29.348 --> 56:30.808
But like this?

56:34.979 --> 56:36.108
Look here, man.

56:36.188 --> 56:39.817
Before I throw up in my mouth,
let me ask you, what are we doing here?

56:39.984 --> 56:41.527
That's a good question, Roman.

56:42.820 --> 56:44.071
Let me show you.

56:48.659 --> 56:51.203
Welcome to our new base of operations.

56:51.370 --> 56:54.498
No, seriously. What is this place?

56:54.665 --> 56:57.084
This is heaven.

57:03.049 --> 57:06.260
It's the agency garage.
They call it the Toy Shop.

57:13.476 --> 57:15.314
This is where we house every vehicle

57:15.394 --> 57:17.563
seized from drug dealers on the East Coast.

57:17.730 --> 57:21.817
Now, Mr. Nobody said that if we're
gonna have a chance at catching Dom,

57:23.235 --> 57:25.363
we're gonna have to be damn fast.

57:26.572 --> 57:28.240
Figured this would help.

57:31.452 --> 57:32.828
We got a tank.

57:32.995 --> 57:35.122
750 horsepower,

57:35.289 --> 57:39.126
6.6 liter, V8 Duramax engine

57:39.293 --> 57:43.255
with an M153 CROWS remotely
operated weapon station on top.

57:43.422 --> 57:45.716
You didn't get this from drug dealers.

57:45.883 --> 57:49.512
No. No, that, uh,
the United States Army lent me.

57:49.720 --> 57:53.160
See, the Army's developing machines like this
that soldiers can drive from a mile away,

57:53.224 --> 57:55.768
so they can stay safe and alive.

57:55.935 --> 57:58.604
But, luckily, there's a
backup driver's seat

57:58.771 --> 58:02.274
for those of us that like
to get more "hands on."

58:02.441 --> 58:04.193
I'm sitting here wondering this whole time,

58:04.360 --> 58:07.279
will this thing fit in valet
at Cheesecake Factory?

58:07.446 --> 58:09.824
No one is getting "hands on."

58:09.990 --> 58:12.284
She doesn't go on city streets.

58:15.579 --> 58:18.708
Wow. I'm in love.

58:20.876 --> 58:22.837
Again, no, no.

58:23.004 --> 58:24.884
That's a million-dollar show car.

58:24.964 --> 58:26.674
The point is to not draw attention.

58:26.841 --> 58:28.843
It's reverse psychology.

58:28.926 --> 58:30.261
Dom would never see it coming.

58:30.428 --> 58:31.721
It's neon orange.

58:31.887 --> 58:34.932
The International Space Station
would see it coming.

58:35.099 --> 58:37.560
Go choose anything less conspicuous.

58:37.727 --> 58:39.395
No, no, no. Calipers are my...

58:39.562 --> 58:40.691
- This is ridiculous.
- Not happening.

58:40.771 --> 58:42.273
Hey, my man,
you can put that down right there.

58:42.440 --> 58:46.152
This is a gift, a real gift.
I know what you're doing.

58:47.235 --> 58:50.239
I like your beard.
You're Blanta. Black Santa?

58:52.116 --> 58:54.660
No, I'm serious. Put it down right there.

59:21.812 --> 59:22.938
What are you doing?

59:23.105 --> 59:25.441
<i>Engine's misfiring. I gotta check it out.</i>

59:25.608 --> 59:27.234
No, that's not part of the plan, Dom.

59:27.401 --> 59:28.694
<i>Clearly.</i>

59:28.861 --> 59:31.405
<i>But unless you want
the engine to seize on the job...</i>

59:32.490 --> 59:33.908
You have five minutes.

59:41.874 --> 59:43.626
<i>Five minutes.</i>

59:46.170 --> 59:47.380
I want another visual.

59:55.721 --> 59:56.972
I got an ATM.

01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:10.152
I don't like this.

01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:25.459
I want to see Toretto.

01:00:25.626 --> 01:00:27.420
- There are no more cameras.
- Then find something!

01:00:27.586 --> 01:00:28.921
Punch in on something reflective.

01:00:29.088 --> 01:00:31.007
A car mirror, anything.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.560
Do you know who I am?

01:00:42.727 --> 01:00:44.145
It's why I'm here.

01:00:44.895 --> 01:00:47.023
Do you know what I'm capable of?

01:00:48.649 --> 01:00:50.484
It's why I'm here.

01:00:51.402 --> 01:00:53.863
I'll give you until I finish me cuppa.

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:55.823
And I'm fucking thirsty.

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:59.577
I've got limited time,
so I won't take up too much of yours.

01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:01.579
Oh, no.

01:01:01.912 --> 01:01:05.207
No, you've already taken everything
I have of value, Mr. Toretto.

01:01:05.374 --> 01:01:07.752
What more could you possibly want?

01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:10.296
To give you something back.

01:01:19.847 --> 01:01:20.931
Talk to me.

01:01:24.435 --> 01:01:26.145
Something's not right here.

01:01:27.271 --> 01:01:31.776
First time I saw my son
was behind a bulletproof glass.

01:01:33.027 --> 01:01:36.572
When he reached for me,
I couldn't hold him.

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:39.909
It's the worst pain I ever felt.

01:01:41.369 --> 01:01:44.080
I know you know exactly how that feels.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.125
Maybe we could change that.

01:01:49.085 --> 01:01:50.586
Now, why do I think

01:01:50.753 --> 01:01:55.299
you're about to suggest something
really dodgy, Mr. Toretto?

01:02:00.388 --> 01:02:02.348
It's why I'm here.

01:02:03.683 --> 01:02:07.186
Jesus, punch in on something.
I'm not liking this. Something's not right.

01:02:08.104 --> 01:02:10.481
- Rhodes, you close?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:02:10.898 --> 01:02:11.899
Go.

01:02:12.066 --> 01:02:13.776
The delivery truck's moving.

01:02:23.994 --> 01:02:25.079
<i>I know.</i>

01:02:46.058 --> 01:02:51.105
"Captain Deckard Shaw distinguished
himself by acts of gallantry

01:02:51.272 --> 01:02:54.358
"at the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty.

01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:59.113
"His bold actions saved the lives
of hostages and his teammates.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.366
"Recommendation: Victoria Cross."

01:03:02.742 --> 01:03:05.494
Highest honor the British
government has ever given

01:03:07.038 --> 01:03:08.414
to a traitor.

01:03:10.374 --> 01:03:12.710
Something about this whole thing
that just doesn't add up to me.

01:03:12.877 --> 01:03:14.879
Well, that would be
the same kind of funny math

01:03:15.046 --> 01:03:19.342
that says a DSS agent who has
a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.

01:03:19.508 --> 01:03:21.469
Sound familiar, huh?

01:03:28.642 --> 01:03:29.722
You want to give me a hand?

01:03:33.022 --> 01:03:34.023
- On three?
- Yeah.

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:36.208
One, two, three.

01:03:39.653 --> 01:03:40.773
You know what, Twinkle Toes?

01:03:40.821 --> 01:03:43.501
In another life, I bet me and you
could've done some serious damage.

01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:45.910
- Yeah, we could've.
- Yeah.

01:03:47.453 --> 01:03:50.790
Shame I'm gonna have to bounce your head
off the fender when this is all over.

01:03:52.917 --> 01:03:55.127
Ah, well, with all due respect, Captain,

01:03:55.294 --> 01:03:57.614
when this whole thing is over,
we're gonna find a location,

01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:59.382
and I'm gonna knock your teeth
so far down your throat,

01:03:59.548 --> 01:04:02.718
you're gonna stick a toothbrush
right up your ass to brush them.

01:04:09.809 --> 01:04:11.018
Give me God's Eye.

01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:12.895
God's Eye, active.

01:04:13.104 --> 01:04:14.188
Good.

01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:16.774
Let's find us a Russian.

01:04:17.441 --> 01:04:19.735
I spy with my little eye,

01:04:20.152 --> 01:04:22.363
a Minister of Defense.

01:04:39.839 --> 01:04:42.091
We land back in Moscow by nine.

01:04:42.258 --> 01:04:44.260
Here's the latest defense report.

01:04:44.427 --> 01:04:46.554
All the items in yesterday's brief.

01:04:48.806 --> 01:04:50.558
Upload those coordinates to Dom's nav.

01:04:50.641 --> 01:04:51.767
Copy that.

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:16.500
He's in the third car.

01:05:17.585 --> 01:05:20.045
<i>It's a Guard Class limousine.</i>

01:05:34.185 --> 01:05:35.227
Where's my team?

01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:37.354
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of them yet.

01:05:37.438 --> 01:05:39.023
They're off the grid.

01:05:39.106 --> 01:05:41.025
They're probably just
bunkered down somewhere.

01:05:41.108 --> 01:05:42.276
<i>We're closing in on 'em.</i>

01:05:44.153 --> 01:05:45.279
You guys ready?

01:05:45.446 --> 01:05:49.408
One thing I can guarantee,
Dom, no one's ready for this.

01:05:49.867 --> 01:05:52.870
I want every chip with a zero-day
exploit in a two-mile radius

01:05:53.037 --> 01:05:54.372
around that motorcade now.

01:05:54.538 --> 01:05:55.873
There's over a thousand of them.

01:05:56.207 --> 01:05:57.208
Hack 'em all.

01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:16.102
It's zombie time.

01:06:23.901 --> 01:06:25.653
I'd buckle up if I were you.

01:06:29.657 --> 01:06:30.866
What are you doing?

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.275
Safety sensors overridden.

01:07:04.358 --> 01:07:05.443
Thank you.

01:07:28.466 --> 01:07:29.467
Hey!

01:07:37.725 --> 01:07:38.809
Target the motorcade.

01:07:49.153 --> 01:07:51.155
And here they come.

01:07:56.077 --> 01:07:57.161
What is going on?

01:08:02.166 --> 01:08:03.167
Drive!

01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:10.341
Police escort down.

01:08:10.716 --> 01:08:12.343
Take out the lead and follow cars.

01:08:28.651 --> 01:08:29.652
Drive! Drive!

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.042
- Two more down.
- They're still under warranty.

01:08:42.122 --> 01:08:44.834
There's more ahead of us.
Shoot their engines!

01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:54.051
Oh, God!

01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:11.609
<i>We got an army of cars driving themselves!
Send backup, send SWAT!</i>

01:09:11.694 --> 01:09:13.821
<i>I don't care if you send
the goddamn Boy Scouts,</i>

01:09:13.904 --> 01:09:15.156
<i>just send 'em some help!</i>

01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:16.490
Now, that's Dom.

01:09:22.246 --> 01:09:23.247
Faster, faster!

01:09:45.353 --> 01:09:46.854
The motorcade just turned on Seventh.

01:09:46.937 --> 01:09:48.522
Perfect. Make it rain.

01:10:40.074 --> 01:10:41.075
Oh, God!

01:10:47.498 --> 01:10:48.499
Target immobilized.

01:10:49.917 --> 01:10:51.043
You're up, Dom.

01:11:05.433 --> 01:11:06.809
What the hell is that?

01:11:06.976 --> 01:11:08.019
What's he doing?

01:11:11.439 --> 01:11:12.440
What are you waiting for?

01:11:13.274 --> 01:11:14.316
Shoot him!

01:11:14.817 --> 01:11:16.235
Come on, come on!

01:11:25.453 --> 01:11:26.454
I'm out.

01:11:28.247 --> 01:11:29.290
Shit.

01:11:29.373 --> 01:11:30.373
Don't worry, sir.

01:11:30.416 --> 01:11:31.709
The car is impenetrable.

01:11:31.959 --> 01:11:33.044
You'll be safe in here.

01:11:37.548 --> 01:11:38.758
Give me the case.

01:11:38.841 --> 01:11:39.841
Give him the case!

01:11:39.884 --> 01:11:41.635
Those are nuclear launch codes.

01:11:41.886 --> 01:11:43.888
We cannot give it to him.

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.061
What is he doing?

01:12:07.536 --> 01:12:08.936
He just cut a hole in our gas tank!

01:12:36.273 --> 01:12:37.608
Good work, Dom.

01:12:38.567 --> 01:12:39.694
Meet you at the pickup.

01:12:50.204 --> 01:12:51.831
<i>I think I know where my team's at.</i>

01:12:52.373 --> 01:12:54.125
- Where?
- Right in front of me.

01:13:07.054 --> 01:13:08.097
This is on you.

01:13:08.848 --> 01:13:10.266
Get out of there, Dom.

01:13:10.558 --> 01:13:12.018
<i>Guys, I know why Dom's here.</i>

01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:15.354
Police scanners are saying
he stole a nuclear football.

01:13:18.733 --> 01:13:22.019
<i>It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass outta the car now.</i>

01:13:28.993 --> 01:13:30.494
<i>So, that's how you wanna play this?</i>

01:13:31.412 --> 01:13:32.663
<i>Let's play.</i>

01:13:38.586 --> 01:13:40.379
Don't do this, Dom.

01:13:43.674 --> 01:13:44.759
He's going for it!

01:13:45.676 --> 01:13:47.076
- What are you doing?
- It's a trap!

01:13:49.722 --> 01:13:50.765
Damn it!

01:14:12.328 --> 01:14:14.872
Now I know what it feels like
to be every cop ever chasing us!

01:14:15.039 --> 01:14:16.540
I'm gonna get a little closer.
I'm gonna PIT him.

01:14:16.707 --> 01:14:18.542
Oh, so, you just gonna PIT Dom?

01:14:18.668 --> 01:14:21.671
Little Nobody has clearly
lost his little mind.

01:14:34.225 --> 01:14:35.267
I'm on him.

01:14:35.351 --> 01:14:36.727
Easy. Work together.

01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:47.571
Wait, wait, wait!

01:14:49.407 --> 01:14:50.574
Oh, sh...

01:14:57.331 --> 01:14:58.416
I'll take the shortcut!

01:15:11.804 --> 01:15:13.723
Look out! Watch those people!

01:15:14.598 --> 01:15:16.058
Big Sexy comin' through!

01:15:45.796 --> 01:15:47.006
Not this time, Dom.

01:16:18.162 --> 01:16:20.664
Watch the drag or the line will snap!

01:16:46.357 --> 01:16:48.025
Stretch him out! Hold him!

01:17:16.387 --> 01:17:18.723
He's gotta have about
2,000 horsepower in that thing.

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.141
Try 3,000!

01:17:24.353 --> 01:17:25.521
Try five.

01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:34.905
Get out of there.

01:17:35.072 --> 01:17:36.115
I'm working on it.

01:17:36.198 --> 01:17:38.075
<i>Stop working on it and do it.</i>

01:17:50.504 --> 01:17:52.298
No, no, no, this my Bentley!

01:18:02.933 --> 01:18:04.643
No! No!

01:18:32.213 --> 01:18:34.215
Get that case and run.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.770
Move.

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:55.820
They thought this was
gonna be a street fight.

01:18:56.195 --> 01:18:57.555
What are you waiting for, Toretto?

01:19:00.408 --> 01:19:01.575
No!

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:15.464
Letty, stop!

01:19:20.511 --> 01:19:21.512
What are you gonna do?

01:19:34.692 --> 01:19:38.612
I don't know why you're doing this,
but I know one thing.

01:19:40.156 --> 01:19:41.198
You love me.

01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:47.788
And you are not gonna shoot me.

01:19:59.383 --> 01:20:02.678
You should've given him the case,
'cause I won't chase you.

01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:06.182
Okay.

01:20:06.891 --> 01:20:08.768
I will just take it from a dead girl.

01:20:10.728 --> 01:20:12.229
You willing to die for it?

01:20:30.581 --> 01:20:31.707
Let's go, then.

01:20:53.437 --> 01:20:54.438
Anything?

01:20:55.439 --> 01:20:56.607
They're gone.

01:20:58.025 --> 01:21:00.111
And DOD confirmed it was
a nuclear football.

01:21:00.444 --> 01:21:02.947
He's got an EMP and nuclear launch codes.

01:21:04.407 --> 01:21:07.910
I don't know what it is,
but they're building towards something.

01:21:08.327 --> 01:21:09.412
Deckard?

01:21:10.955 --> 01:21:12.039
He didn't make it.

01:21:33.644 --> 01:21:35.021
<i>I'm disappointed in you, Dom.</i>

01:21:36.063 --> 01:21:39.483
<i>When push came to shove, you were gonna
let Letty just walk away with the codes.</i>

01:21:39.567 --> 01:21:40.693
You got the codes!

01:21:40.776 --> 01:21:42.319
<i>Rhodes got the codes.</i>

01:21:42.903 --> 01:21:45.322
<i>You made the choice to let her go.</i>

01:21:47.158 --> 01:21:49.160
And now I have to make one of my own.

01:22:01.339 --> 01:22:05.009
They are adorable little
things, aren't they?

01:22:05.801 --> 01:22:07.595
God, I hope I don't hurt him.

01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:15.019
Look, psychotic, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

01:22:16.145 --> 01:22:17.271
Don't do this.

01:22:17.646 --> 01:22:19.023
This is your doing.

01:22:19.357 --> 01:22:20.358
My doing?

01:22:25.029 --> 01:22:26.530
Da-dada.

01:22:26.697 --> 01:22:27.948
Dada.

01:22:28.366 --> 01:22:29.575
Da-da.

01:22:30.159 --> 01:22:31.911
Please don't hurt him, I'm begging you.

01:22:31.994 --> 01:22:34.372
I don't want you to beg.

01:22:36.874 --> 01:22:38.334
I want you to learn.

01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:40.044
Learn what?

01:22:41.337 --> 01:22:45.007
I understand why you did
what you did. I really do.

01:22:47.677 --> 01:22:48.803
Da-da.

01:22:51.555 --> 01:22:53.516
But it was the wrong choice.

01:22:54.392 --> 01:22:56.894
This is the consequence of that.

01:22:58.646 --> 01:22:59.647
No!

01:22:59.814 --> 01:23:01.565
No! No!

01:23:01.732 --> 01:23:02.983
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

01:23:04.318 --> 01:23:05.945
Save your son!

01:23:06.362 --> 01:23:07.405
No!

01:23:34.598 --> 01:23:37.101
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the alley?

01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:38.894
Traffic cams.

01:23:39.061 --> 01:23:40.062
I got you.

01:23:44.608 --> 01:23:45.651
I knew it.

01:23:46.110 --> 01:23:47.403
I recognize that guy.

01:23:48.362 --> 01:23:49.613
That's Connor Rhodes.

01:23:50.031 --> 01:23:52.700
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

01:23:52.783 --> 01:23:55.077
He wanted us to get
the Nightshade device for him.

01:23:55.494 --> 01:23:56.704
Connor Rhodes.

01:23:57.538 --> 01:23:59.919
He's also linked to somebody
I'd quite like to forget.

01:23:59.999 --> 01:24:01.500
It's Mose Jakande.

01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:04.170
Warlord who tried to get God's Eye.

01:24:04.253 --> 01:24:06.922
Which means that's twice that Dom
has messed up Cipher's business.

01:24:20.728 --> 01:24:25.232
Everything you're feeling right now,
this rage, a sense of loss, it's not real.

01:24:26.734 --> 01:24:30.571
It's a survival instinct
wired deep into our brains

01:24:30.654 --> 01:24:33.324
to ensure continuation of the species.

01:24:34.533 --> 01:24:37.995
When early man would visit a watering hole,

01:24:38.079 --> 01:24:39.997
if they didn't watch their child,

01:24:40.081 --> 01:24:42.500
and it got snatched by a crocodile,

01:24:43.542 --> 01:24:49.548
our brains would create
a painful but instructional memory,

01:24:51.008 --> 01:24:52.760
so it would never happen again.

01:24:55.012 --> 01:24:58.099
This idea of "family"
that is so core with you,

01:24:58.265 --> 01:25:00.017
that rules your world,

01:25:02.019 --> 01:25:03.604
it's a biological lie.

01:25:05.356 --> 01:25:07.066
You don't have to accept it.

01:25:09.527 --> 01:25:10.569
I don't.

01:25:13.531 --> 01:25:16.534
Did you really think you
could destroy two of my teams

01:25:16.617 --> 01:25:18.369
without any repercussions?

01:25:19.578 --> 01:25:22.373
I wouldn't have even looked
your way if you hadn't done that.

01:25:22.998 --> 01:25:25.001
You didn't even know you had a kid.

01:25:26.419 --> 01:25:29.922
You can thank me for that and start
doing the job I'm asking you to do.

01:25:30.089 --> 01:25:31.507
Help you start a war.

01:25:31.674 --> 01:25:33.509
Is that what you think I want?

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:37.471
That's so limited.

01:25:39.223 --> 01:25:41.100
I didn't take that football to start a war

01:25:41.183 --> 01:25:43.894
any more than I took
your son to start a family.

01:25:44.854 --> 01:25:46.731
Taking your son got me the codes.

01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:49.362
The codes will get me the nukes

01:25:49.442 --> 01:25:51.819
and the nukes will get me what I want

01:25:51.902 --> 01:25:56.407
today, tomorrow, and every day after that.

01:25:56.615 --> 01:25:58.075
And what's that?

01:26:00.244 --> 01:26:01.495
Accountability.

01:26:03.956 --> 01:26:06.167
The second I fire off one of those nukes,

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:09.628
I put the superpowers
of this world on notice that,

01:26:09.712 --> 01:26:11.255
when they cross the line,

01:26:13.758 --> 01:26:16.260
I'm gonna be there to
hold them responsible.

01:26:18.095 --> 01:26:20.056
Because the truth is, Dom,

01:26:20.598 --> 01:26:22.141
to the world out there,

01:26:25.102 --> 01:26:27.688
I am the crocodile at the watering hole.

01:26:34.153 --> 01:26:35.988
We've got one last job to do.

01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:39.116
Cipher.

01:26:48.584 --> 01:26:49.960
If I were you, I'd kiss my son.

01:26:53.881 --> 01:26:57.593
Because whether
you value it or not, all of this,

01:26:58.386 --> 01:27:01.764
your plane, your security, and you,

01:27:02.765 --> 01:27:04.809
are still on this earth because of him.

01:27:10.648 --> 01:27:13.448
<i>The problem we've had with tracking
Cipher is there's nothing to trace.</i>

01:27:13.484 --> 01:27:14.964
But now, we have Rhodes' information.

01:27:15.027 --> 01:27:18.698
And we're getting snapshots of his data
before it's scrubbed off the net.

01:27:18.781 --> 01:27:21.454
That looks like somebody's bank account,
so why don't we just go ahead...

01:27:21.534 --> 01:27:22.702
It's a longitude.

01:27:23.411 --> 01:27:25.663
Given the fact that Dom
hit a Russian motorcade,

01:27:25.746 --> 01:27:28.106
it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.

01:27:29.291 --> 01:27:31.252
Good. Let's start here
and run the possibilities.

01:27:32.003 --> 01:27:34.672
Yalta, Poltava...

01:27:34.755 --> 01:27:36.475
It's like they just threw letters together.

01:27:36.507 --> 01:27:37.550
Kronyurt.

01:27:37.633 --> 01:27:38.843
It's "Vladovin."

01:27:39.051 --> 01:27:40.594
- What are you doing here?
- What?

01:27:40.761 --> 01:27:43.643
Told you I was gonna check in on you from
time to time to see how you were doin'.

01:27:43.723 --> 01:27:45.182
By the way, not so hot.

01:27:45.808 --> 01:27:48.394
But there's nothing in Vladovin.
It's just ice.

01:27:48.477 --> 01:27:49.645
That's funny.

01:27:49.937 --> 01:27:51.856
Could've sworn there was
a secret Russian naval base

01:27:51.939 --> 01:27:53.858
where they retrofitted Cold War submarines.

01:27:53.941 --> 01:27:56.235
Well, technically, it's
not Russian anymore.

01:27:56.861 --> 01:27:57.862
The base was taken over

01:27:57.945 --> 01:28:00.305
by a terror group of military
separatists about a month ago,

01:28:00.322 --> 01:28:01.953
and the Russians haven't taken it back yet,

01:28:02.033 --> 01:28:04.285
so there is a little window
of opportunity here.

01:28:04.535 --> 01:28:06.871
Russian submarines. Nuclear football.

01:28:07.038 --> 01:28:10.249
It sounds like everything we do,
our legs gonna be blown off.

01:28:10.416 --> 01:28:13.669
It sounds like you still
number 11 on the list.

01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:15.755
It sounds like you've changed

01:28:15.838 --> 01:28:18.257
since your little punk-ass
facial hairs done came in.

01:28:18.382 --> 01:28:19.467
Guys, guys.

01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:21.886
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.

01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:24.764
That's good thinking, champ,
except unfortunately,

01:28:24.847 --> 01:28:26.891
the Russian Minister of Defense

01:28:26.974 --> 01:28:29.727
got himself involved in a little
incident on US territory,

01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:31.937
and the two governments aren't talking
to each other for a while.

01:28:32.021 --> 01:28:33.647
By the time they do, it'll be too late.

01:28:33.731 --> 01:28:35.524
So, any other suggestions?

01:28:36.359 --> 01:28:38.402
Yeah. I got one.

01:28:39.278 --> 01:28:41.113
How about we just stop them ourselves?

01:28:41.197 --> 01:28:43.074
You're talking about a
Russian military base.

01:28:43.157 --> 01:28:44.325
Separatist.

01:28:44.408 --> 01:28:45.493
Whatever. It's suicide.

01:28:45.576 --> 01:28:47.036
It's stopping World War III.

01:28:49.163 --> 01:28:50.247
What's it gonna be, rook?

01:28:50.748 --> 01:28:52.833
You gonna close your eyes on this one, too?

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.961
Pray that the apocalypse doesn't come
knocking on your mama's front door?

01:28:56.671 --> 01:28:59.006
Or, are you gonna saddle up, be a man,

01:28:59.090 --> 01:29:01.592
and save the entire goddamn world?

01:29:07.598 --> 01:29:10.059
You know, I think I figured it out.

01:29:10.351 --> 01:29:11.477
What's that?

01:29:11.644 --> 01:29:13.521
- Rule number three.
- Which is?

01:29:15.022 --> 01:29:16.107
There are no rules.

01:29:18.484 --> 01:29:21.612
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

01:29:21.779 --> 01:29:23.322
Aerial transport leaves in an hour.

01:29:23.406 --> 01:29:25.950
Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.

01:29:26.158 --> 01:29:27.868
- All bets are off?
- Bets are off?

01:29:27.952 --> 01:29:29.286
<i>Do svidanya!</i>

01:29:55.146 --> 01:29:56.946
Letty, I don't like
telling you this one bit.

01:29:57.314 --> 01:29:58.774
But the game's changed.

01:29:59.316 --> 01:30:02.153
Before, we were just trying to catch Dom,
but now, after all this,

01:30:02.403 --> 01:30:04.155
I want you to know, if I have to,

01:30:05.656 --> 01:30:06.782
I'm gonna put him down.

01:30:09.827 --> 01:30:11.467
Then you might have to take us both down.

01:30:13.164 --> 01:30:14.457
I'm freezing, man.

01:30:14.915 --> 01:30:16.587
This ain't for me.

01:30:16.667 --> 01:30:19.211
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle, brah.

01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:24.842
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.

01:30:26.052 --> 01:30:30.014
I tried to take a piss,
I didn't even recognize myself.

01:30:30.431 --> 01:30:32.683
Man, that's entirely too much information.

01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:33.934
I'm just sayin'.

01:30:34.101 --> 01:30:35.770
Well, one thing's for sure.

01:30:36.687 --> 01:30:39.151
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a trade,

01:30:39.231 --> 01:30:40.691
because no one would be this insane

01:30:40.775 --> 01:30:42.360
to hit this place without a damn army.

01:30:43.527 --> 01:30:45.696
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

01:30:47.156 --> 01:30:48.366
Speak of the devil.

01:30:56.374 --> 01:30:59.710
All right, Dom, you're one step
closer to that family reunion.

01:30:59.877 --> 01:31:01.045
400 meters to base.

01:31:01.212 --> 01:31:03.547
Prep the EMP. Let's take
these defenses down.

01:31:15.309 --> 01:31:16.829
We have a possible threat approaching.

01:31:17.186 --> 01:31:20.606
Raise the barricade.

01:31:37.081 --> 01:31:39.083
We've lost power, defensive positions now.

01:31:41.211 --> 01:31:43.921
Gates are open. Let's
get this party started.

01:31:59.937 --> 01:32:01.564
- EMP is recharging.
- How long?

01:32:01.897 --> 01:32:03.107
Sixty seconds.

01:32:03.983 --> 01:32:06.527
All right, Dom, you have
one pulse left in that EMP.

01:32:07.028 --> 01:32:08.654
That sub is heavily insulated.

01:32:08.821 --> 01:32:11.461
You're gonna need to be right
underneath it for this thing to work.

01:32:35.348 --> 01:32:36.807
Come on.

01:32:36.891 --> 01:32:38.893
Engaging target. He's beneath the sub.

01:32:45.107 --> 01:32:47.568
Mayday! Mayday! I've lost all power.
I'm going down.

01:32:54.325 --> 01:32:55.326
<i>Yes!</i>

01:32:55.493 --> 01:32:56.994
Two birds with one stone.

01:32:57.161 --> 01:32:58.496
We've got control of the sub.

01:32:58.579 --> 01:33:01.248
Dom, we are good.
Head over to the rendezvous.

01:33:01.332 --> 01:33:04.418
Okay, Matty, let's take
this baby for a spin.

01:33:10.091 --> 01:33:11.258
Damn!

01:33:11.425 --> 01:33:14.025
I think Cipher just rebooted that
sub to slave its command system.

01:33:14.345 --> 01:33:15.721
What the hell is he talking about?

01:33:15.971 --> 01:33:19.517
In layman's terms,
she just carjacked a submarine.

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:22.645
We can't let it get away.

01:33:23.396 --> 01:33:24.730
There's the control room.

01:33:25.314 --> 01:33:27.233
If you can get me into that wheelhouse,

01:33:27.316 --> 01:33:29.280
I can tap the network
and counter-hack Cipher.

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.990
Keep it from lowering into the water.

01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:32.947
No, what we need to do
is get me on that sub.

01:33:33.197 --> 01:33:35.199
I find the weapons room
and I can pull the launch chip

01:33:35.282 --> 01:33:36.842
before she can fire any of those nukes.

01:33:36.867 --> 01:33:37.952
That is too crazy.

01:33:38.119 --> 01:33:39.412
What you're saying is too dangerous.

01:33:39.495 --> 01:33:40.538
We'll do both.

01:34:04.937 --> 01:34:05.938
Knock, knock.

01:34:11.027 --> 01:34:13.320
Five vehicles just breached the base.

01:34:13.487 --> 01:34:15.156
They just don't give up, do they?

01:34:24.206 --> 01:34:26.792
All right, let's haul ass, team.
Double time, double time!

01:34:34.467 --> 01:34:35.843
Letty, let's roll!

01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:39.638
Go! Go, go, go!

01:35:15.883 --> 01:35:16.926
<i>Change of plans, Dom.</i>

01:35:17.218 --> 01:35:19.418
I'm sending you new coordinates.
Head there immediately.

01:35:19.679 --> 01:35:21.222
<i>I'm done. I want my son.</i>

01:35:21.305 --> 01:35:22.545
I'll tell you when you're done.

01:35:22.848 --> 01:35:24.183
<i>Your team is in play.</i>

01:35:24.266 --> 01:35:26.644
Now, meet Rhodes and follow my instruction.

01:35:32.066 --> 01:35:33.693
I've got you covered! Go!

01:35:36.654 --> 01:35:39.156
Move, move! Get outta here! Go, go, go!

01:35:47.081 --> 01:35:49.166
Okay. How do you like this?

01:35:52.461 --> 01:35:55.047
- Remote link has been severed.
- I'll take care of this.

01:35:58.968 --> 01:36:00.302
Hi, Ramsey.

01:36:04.181 --> 01:36:05.433
She's regained control.

01:36:05.599 --> 01:36:06.851
Damn it. She's good.

01:36:48.267 --> 01:36:49.480
They're entering the weapons room.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.603
Oh, that's cute.

01:36:57.234 --> 01:36:58.361
Pull! Pull!

01:36:58.736 --> 01:37:01.072
Roman, Roman! We gotta find the chip, go!

01:37:04.617 --> 01:37:05.826
Oh, she's slick.

01:37:06.077 --> 01:37:07.757
Gonna have to do better than that, though.

01:37:09.663 --> 01:37:11.582
Okay, now you're starting to piss me off.

01:37:26.806 --> 01:37:28.891
Ramsey, how much time we talkin' here?

01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:32.395
You're smart, but not smart enough.

01:37:35.898 --> 01:37:36.899
She's locked me out.

01:37:40.945 --> 01:37:43.367
Tej, I can't stop her.
You're gonna have to pull that chip.

01:37:43.447 --> 01:37:45.578
I can't! This thing's
gone into attack mode!

01:37:45.658 --> 01:37:47.785
<i>The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip!</i>

01:37:48.828 --> 01:37:51.622
Tej, we got no idea
what the hell we're looking for.

01:37:52.998 --> 01:37:54.000
I got it!

01:37:56.961 --> 01:37:59.422
What in the hell are you guys doin'?

01:38:00.423 --> 01:38:02.466
It wasn't me. It wasn't me, okay?

01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:04.135
It'll be labeled "Guidance Go."

01:38:04.343 --> 01:38:06.178
- Guidance Go, Guidance Go...
- Okay, I got somethin'.

01:38:06.262 --> 01:38:07.638
- What?
- It says...

01:38:13.769 --> 01:38:14.895
Do you understand that?

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.380
Wow. Nasty.

01:38:55.019 --> 01:38:56.354
Quite a show.

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:00.441
We're arming the nuke.

01:39:05.821 --> 01:39:08.282
<i>Nuke's going hot!
She's tryin' to fire this thing!</i>

01:39:08.366 --> 01:39:10.496
- Roger that. We're moving out.
- Disable the nukes!

01:39:10.576 --> 01:39:12.203
Roman, what are you seeing?
Come on, talk to me.

01:39:12.328 --> 01:39:13.954
I don't see shit. I'm holding on!

01:39:15.831 --> 01:39:17.083
And we have a countdown.

01:39:20.711 --> 01:39:22.421
What the hell is goin' on, man?

01:39:22.505 --> 01:39:25.549
<i>We're about to launch a nuclear missile,
is what the hell is goin' on!</i>

01:39:25.633 --> 01:39:26.676
<i>Pull the damn chip!</i>

01:39:30.096 --> 01:39:32.473
Countdown, countdown! Look for a countdown!

01:39:32.556 --> 01:39:33.599
What countdown?

01:39:33.683 --> 01:39:35.309
The missiles need to activate to launch.

01:39:35.393 --> 01:39:37.061
The countdown timer won't be in Russian.

01:39:37.353 --> 01:39:38.354
The countdown...

01:39:38.896 --> 01:39:41.065
Let's show the world what we've got.

01:39:42.650 --> 01:39:43.901
No, no, no! Don't press that!

01:39:46.404 --> 01:39:47.405
I got it.

01:39:49.573 --> 01:39:51.409
Something's wrong. It won't launch.

01:39:53.119 --> 01:39:55.621
Get that sub outta there. Now!

01:39:58.207 --> 01:39:59.750
Move your ass, Roman!

01:40:07.717 --> 01:40:08.801
You all right?

01:40:08.884 --> 01:40:10.644
There's nothing all right
about any of this!

01:40:10.886 --> 01:40:12.805
- Let's go!
- What about the missiles?

01:40:14.056 --> 01:40:16.062
We got the chip. No nukes for her.

01:40:16.142 --> 01:40:18.269
Hell, yeah. Let's roll.

01:40:22.398 --> 01:40:24.942
Guys, we got company. A lot of company!

01:40:29.864 --> 01:40:31.184
All right, team, here's the plan.

01:40:31.198 --> 01:40:32.998
There's a sea lock at
the opening of the bay.

01:40:33.159 --> 01:40:34.285
<i>We get there first and close it,</i>

01:40:34.368 --> 01:40:37.288
we can stop the submarine
from escaping into open water

01:40:37.413 --> 01:40:38.831
<i>and disappearing forever.</i>

01:40:40.708 --> 01:40:43.461
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles southwest.

01:40:43.711 --> 01:40:46.172
Ten miles?
We're not gonna make it ten seconds!

01:40:53.679 --> 01:40:56.140
No, no, no! This is not good!

01:40:56.974 --> 01:40:59.393
What's the matter, Roman?
Forgot your snow tires?

01:40:59.685 --> 01:41:01.103
Whoa!

01:41:01.312 --> 01:41:02.897
You lovin' that Lambo now?

01:41:03.272 --> 01:41:05.107
Whoa! Ah!

01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:14.325
All right, everyone.

01:41:14.408 --> 01:41:15.659
We'll deal with that launch chip later.

01:41:15.743 --> 01:41:18.457
Right now, I want that sub
in deep water where no one can find it.

01:41:18.537 --> 01:41:20.217
Find me the fastest route out of that bay.

01:41:20.247 --> 01:41:21.248
Copy that.

01:41:30.925 --> 01:41:32.343
Why are they shootin' at me?

01:41:32.426 --> 01:41:34.640
Maybe 'cause you're in an orange
Lamborghini, I don't know.

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.514
Shut up, Tej!

01:41:41.852 --> 01:41:43.187
Dom...

01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:45.022
<i>Do you really wanna put that car in gear?</i>

01:41:46.607 --> 01:41:47.608
Do it.

01:41:47.983 --> 01:41:48.984
Huh?

01:41:51.696 --> 01:41:53.117
I didn't think so.

01:41:53.197 --> 01:41:54.517
They're heading for the sea lock.

01:41:54.573 --> 01:41:55.828
They're trying to trap the sub in the bay.

01:41:55.908 --> 01:41:58.831
I should have taken care
of this a long time ago.

01:41:58.911 --> 01:42:01.372
<i>Rhodes, take his team out.</i>

01:42:02.206 --> 01:42:03.416
I'm on it.

01:42:09.130 --> 01:42:10.381
Roman, get in front of me!

01:42:17.221 --> 01:42:18.931
Okay, y'all wanna play rough?

01:42:20.107 --> 01:42:21.908
Now it's my turn.

01:42:35.856 --> 01:42:37.433
Yeah, baby!

01:42:46.083 --> 01:42:48.377
Guys, we got snowmobiles on the right.

01:42:50.546 --> 01:42:51.922
They're gonna flank us!

01:42:56.093 --> 01:42:57.094
No, they ain't!

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.310
Oh, shit!

01:43:18.699 --> 01:43:19.700
Tej!

01:43:19.825 --> 01:43:21.577
Roman, hold tight, I'm on the way!

01:43:26.082 --> 01:43:28.167
I don't wanna go swimmin'! No!

01:43:34.256 --> 01:43:35.466
Really, Tej?

01:43:38.969 --> 01:43:40.346
Oh, no, no, no!

01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:45.434
Oh, shit!

01:43:48.187 --> 01:43:49.400
Roman, grab your door!

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.564
<i>Tej!</i>

01:43:50.815 --> 01:43:52.111
<i>Grab the door, Roman!</i>

01:43:52.191 --> 01:43:53.192
- <i>It's so cold!</i>
- Shit!

01:43:53.818 --> 01:43:54.819
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:44:01.617 --> 01:44:02.827
Whoa!

01:44:03.244 --> 01:44:04.453
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

01:44:05.162 --> 01:44:06.792
What is going on?

01:44:06.872 --> 01:44:07.957
Roman, hang on!

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:10.501
Tej!

01:44:14.213 --> 01:44:15.798
Get me off of this thing!

01:44:16.173 --> 01:44:17.508
Tej!

01:44:21.012 --> 01:44:22.013
Come on!

01:44:31.897 --> 01:44:33.274
Argh!

01:44:37.028 --> 01:44:39.363
All right. I've had enough of this shit!

01:44:53.586 --> 01:44:55.212
Number 11, my ass!

01:44:57.882 --> 01:45:00.551
Yo, shrinkage! We got a sub to catch.
Get in!

01:45:14.398 --> 01:45:15.399
What?

01:45:15.483 --> 01:45:16.734
Depressurization alert in the cargo hold.

01:45:16.942 --> 01:45:18.569
Drop it to 10,000 feet.

01:45:19.403 --> 01:45:21.781
I know how much these people mean to you.

01:45:21.864 --> 01:45:23.949
So I will let you pick the first target.

01:45:24.033 --> 01:45:25.743
I don't pick a target from a mile away.

01:45:27.578 --> 01:45:30.081
I stand face to face
and look 'em dead in the eye.

01:45:32.249 --> 01:45:33.626
Okay.

01:45:33.909 --> 01:45:35.919
The wife it is.

01:45:53.062 --> 01:45:56.023
Nice plane. I'm gonna enjoy having this.

01:45:56.816 --> 01:45:58.150
Hey, don't go gettin' any ideas.

01:45:58.234 --> 01:45:59.874
You and planes don't have a good history.

01:46:02.321 --> 01:46:03.823
No shit.

01:46:03.906 --> 01:46:06.617
Okay, let's go, Scarface.

01:46:07.284 --> 01:46:09.004
These assholes ain't gonna kill themselves.

01:46:12.498 --> 01:46:14.291
Pull up surveillance right now.

01:46:19.422 --> 01:46:20.798
<i>Surprise.</i>

01:46:22.425 --> 01:46:24.427
You're supposed to be dead.

01:46:34.770 --> 01:46:35.770
You're driving.

01:46:35.813 --> 01:46:37.276
- I said from the beginning...
- No way.

01:46:37.356 --> 01:46:39.116
- I am not going to drive.
- I'm not driving.

01:46:40.651 --> 01:46:44.155
We have a security breach in
the cargo hold. Take care of it now.

01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:52.580
Jesus, Mum.
You're supposed to avoid the nerves.

01:46:52.663 --> 01:46:54.165
Oh, shut up. Don't be such a baby.

01:47:00.588 --> 01:47:01.589
Get to the pilot.

01:47:01.672 --> 01:47:03.432
He's got the second key.
Wait for my signal.

01:47:04.008 --> 01:47:05.343
Give Cipher my regards.

01:47:06.469 --> 01:47:08.179
Did Toretto hold up his end of the deal?

01:47:19.899 --> 01:47:22.068
<i>He gave us this little thing here.</i>

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.362
No, no, no. Don't touch.

01:47:24.987 --> 01:47:26.238
You can track Cipher with this,

01:47:26.322 --> 01:47:29.287
but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of ya.

01:47:29.367 --> 01:47:31.369
Fine. I've got contacts.

01:47:32.495 --> 01:47:33.954
No, you're gonna take your brother.

01:47:34.038 --> 01:47:35.247
- Oh, dear...
- Yes.

01:47:39.377 --> 01:47:41.420
Toretto knows where he is.

01:47:41.504 --> 01:47:43.089
He's got this thing. It can see everything.

01:47:43.172 --> 01:47:45.549
It's like... It's called
the Devil's Bum Hole or something.

01:47:45.633 --> 01:47:46.717
It's called the God's Eye.

01:47:46.801 --> 01:47:47.885
Yeah, well, whatever.

01:47:50.388 --> 01:47:52.977
There's no way I'm using Owen, all right?

01:47:53.057 --> 01:47:54.767
He's a lost cause.

01:47:54.850 --> 01:47:57.895
He's your brother, Decks. He's my son.

01:47:58.396 --> 01:47:59.855
He's our family.

01:48:00.731 --> 01:48:03.984
And our family don't die in bloody cages.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.488
How can you talk like that about Owen?
I can't believe you.

01:48:07.571 --> 01:48:10.661
You've gone and upset me.
You've really upset your mother.

01:48:10.741 --> 01:48:11.992
Call yourself a brother? You're...

01:48:12.076 --> 01:48:14.370
Look, come here... Mum. Okay, okay.

01:48:16.497 --> 01:48:18.416
Every time.

01:48:22.294 --> 01:48:23.295
Owen.

01:48:23.671 --> 01:48:24.880
In position.

01:48:26.424 --> 01:48:27.425
Go.

01:48:29.010 --> 01:48:30.477
I'm in.

01:48:48.738 --> 01:48:49.938
<i>I've got the package, Toretto.</i>

01:48:50.948 --> 01:48:52.616
All 12 pounds of him.

01:48:52.992 --> 01:48:54.368
Ah.

01:48:54.452 --> 01:48:57.788
Dada. Dada.

01:49:13.471 --> 01:49:15.389
You made me miss my shot.

01:49:15.473 --> 01:49:17.308
What you think you're doing?

01:49:19.769 --> 01:49:21.145
Looking at you dead in the eye.

01:49:44.418 --> 01:49:46.337
That was for Elena.

01:49:50.007 --> 01:49:51.008
Rhodes.

01:49:51.175 --> 01:49:52.843
<i>He's no longer with us.</i>

01:49:53.844 --> 01:49:55.429
<i>Rhodes picked the wrong target.</i>

01:49:56.806 --> 01:50:00.601
Congratulations, Dom.
You just killed your son.

01:50:00.685 --> 01:50:03.521
<i>You're wrong. I just saved him.</i>

01:50:04.313 --> 01:50:06.524
<i>And you just took your foot
off the tiger's neck.</i>

01:50:15.032 --> 01:50:17.868
All right, governor, it's gonna get noisy.

01:50:19.036 --> 01:50:20.663
This is for your ears.

01:50:25.626 --> 01:50:26.627
Good?

01:50:29.588 --> 01:50:30.673
Let's go.

01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:36.220
No! Stop him!
Do not let him get off this plane!

01:50:39.056 --> 01:50:40.599
We got another problem.

01:50:40.683 --> 01:50:42.393
That truck's got
enough missiles to take us all out.

01:50:42.643 --> 01:50:43.803
Then don't give 'em a target.

01:50:43.853 --> 01:50:46.150
Everybody, get in front of us,
line up, and we'll take the hit.

01:50:46.230 --> 01:50:49.150
What? I need to switch cars right now!

01:51:01.203 --> 01:51:02.538
Target acquired.

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:07.626
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?

01:51:14.383 --> 01:51:16.635
Hang in there, guys.
We're almost to the lock.

01:51:16.719 --> 01:51:19.597
It's easy for you to say
when your ass ain't on fire.

01:51:25.102 --> 01:51:28.773
All right, little man,
this might be a little scary,

01:51:29.190 --> 01:51:30.608
but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

01:51:42.078 --> 01:51:43.082
How's the music, good?

01:51:43.162 --> 01:51:44.163
Ah.

01:51:56.717 --> 01:51:57.968
They're locking on.

01:51:58.052 --> 01:51:59.512
Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.

01:51:59.595 --> 01:52:00.595
What do we do now?

01:52:00.638 --> 01:52:02.098
<i>We start prayin'!</i>

01:52:24.662 --> 01:52:25.663
Hell, yeah!

01:52:38.426 --> 01:52:39.677
There's Dom!

01:52:43.556 --> 01:52:45.057
What, is this guy on our side now?

01:52:45.141 --> 01:52:47.018
Who the hell cares? He just saved our ass!

01:52:50.688 --> 01:52:52.565
Good to be riding with you again, man.

01:53:05.953 --> 01:53:07.473
Toretto just cleared the way for them.

01:53:07.538 --> 01:53:09.001
Someone, give me something!

01:53:09.081 --> 01:53:10.124
Torpedoes are ready.

01:53:10.207 --> 01:53:11.250
Then launch them!

01:53:24.764 --> 01:53:25.765
Shit.

01:53:29.518 --> 01:53:31.312
- Take the wheel!
- I ain't takin' shit!

01:53:31.395 --> 01:53:32.813
Take the wheel!

01:53:33.314 --> 01:53:34.315
Where you goin'?

01:53:36.067 --> 01:53:37.321
This is crazy!

01:53:37.401 --> 01:53:38.611
Speed up!

01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:43.327
- Left and back!
- What?

01:53:43.407 --> 01:53:45.659
Turn the goddamn wheel
to the left really quickly!

01:53:52.667 --> 01:53:53.834
Boom, baby!

01:54:00.675 --> 01:54:01.759
Goin' for a ride.

01:54:07.264 --> 01:54:08.265
Back in a sec.

01:54:23.572 --> 01:54:24.949
- Where's that smile?
- Ah.

01:54:25.032 --> 01:54:26.200
There it is.

01:54:31.997 --> 01:54:33.165
You were gonna shoot a baby?

01:54:34.458 --> 01:54:36.585
You sick bastard.

01:54:37.545 --> 01:54:38.825
You're not gonna wanna see this.

01:54:52.101 --> 01:54:53.144
Is that you or him?

01:54:56.105 --> 01:54:57.898
Him. Good.

01:54:58.232 --> 01:54:59.525
The torpedoes missed.

01:54:59.608 --> 01:55:01.360
They're gonna reach the lock
before the sub does.

01:55:01.444 --> 01:55:02.653
The hell they are.

01:55:05.406 --> 01:55:06.741
Get ready for this.

01:55:27.011 --> 01:55:28.012
Oh, shit!

01:55:28.095 --> 01:55:29.430
We're gonna need a bigger truck.

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:42.568
It's right under us! Get out the way!

01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:55.915
Get us out of here!

01:55:56.082 --> 01:55:57.625
Why are you always yelling?

01:56:01.587 --> 01:56:02.880
This bitch is crazy!

01:56:02.963 --> 01:56:04.340
Look out!

01:56:10.471 --> 01:56:11.555
That's not good.

01:56:13.015 --> 01:56:14.558
That's not good.

01:56:18.312 --> 01:56:20.231
Please tell me there's nothing
to worry about!

01:56:20.314 --> 01:56:21.732
We got this.

01:56:34.370 --> 01:56:35.621
That's my girl.

01:56:42.169 --> 01:56:44.842
The sub's too close.
We ain't making it to the gate in time.

01:56:44.922 --> 01:56:46.362
We're just going to let it get away?

01:56:46.465 --> 01:56:47.925
Not if I know Dom.

01:56:53.014 --> 01:56:54.306
You lose, Dom.

01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:56.726
<i>I destroyed two of your teams.</i>

01:56:56.976 --> 01:56:59.270
<i>I killed your red-headed boyfriend.</i>

01:56:59.353 --> 01:57:02.481
And I put two killers
on your untraceable plane.

01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:06.402
<i>You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.</i>

01:57:07.278 --> 01:57:09.113
<i>Now guess who I'm coming for.</i>

01:57:09.697 --> 01:57:11.699
Put a heatseeker on him now.

01:57:13.701 --> 01:57:14.827
Now!

01:57:20.166 --> 01:57:21.167
Fire!

01:57:25.504 --> 01:57:27.757
That's a goddamn heatseeker coming at us!

01:57:30.509 --> 01:57:32.887
Peel off! Head to the shore!

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:41.812
All right. Come and get it.

01:57:59.747 --> 01:58:00.873
No, no, no.

01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:04.877
Dive! Dive!

01:58:05.503 --> 01:58:06.712
<i>This...</i>

01:58:06.879 --> 01:58:08.547
This is for my son.

01:58:27.858 --> 01:58:28.859
Dom!

01:59:31.547 --> 01:59:32.885
You're out of bullets, Deckard.

01:59:32.965 --> 01:59:35.593
Not like I'm gonna need a gun
to take care of you.

01:59:36.969 --> 01:59:38.471
How did you find me?

01:59:40.556 --> 01:59:41.932
<i>You want to see the old Dom?</i>

01:59:43.309 --> 01:59:44.518
<i>Watch.</i>

01:59:47.605 --> 01:59:49.065
Resourceful.

01:59:49.607 --> 01:59:51.776
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.

01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:54.195
What you've put my family through.

01:59:54.612 --> 01:59:56.072
My mother.

01:59:57.448 --> 01:59:59.825
I'm gonna make sure that
never happens again.

02:00:00.534 --> 02:00:01.619
To anyone.

02:00:02.370 --> 02:00:04.709
There is only one flaw in your plan.

02:00:04.789 --> 02:00:05.831
What's that?

02:00:05.915 --> 02:00:08.209
Only one of us has a parachute.

02:00:30.815 --> 02:00:32.316
Told you this would be fun.

02:00:36.153 --> 02:00:37.488
Time to land, boys.

02:00:48.082 --> 02:00:49.667
You know I never left you, Letty.

02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:51.002
I know.

02:00:51.419 --> 02:00:53.671
And you know I never will.

02:00:55.172 --> 02:00:56.549
I know.

02:01:06.517 --> 02:01:08.394
I have so much to tell you.

02:01:09.061 --> 02:01:13.065
Yeah, you do.
And you can start with that bitch.

02:01:17.403 --> 02:01:20.698
Now, that's Dominic Toretto.

02:01:22.783 --> 02:01:23.784
Hey, Dom!

02:01:23.868 --> 02:01:27.959
I'm just throwin' it out there,
we need to get up outta here

02:01:28.039 --> 02:01:31.295
'cause there's all kinda nuclearism
happening under this ice.

02:01:31.375 --> 02:01:34.712
Relax. Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.

02:01:35.087 --> 02:01:36.839
Okay. So we good, then.

02:01:37.131 --> 02:01:40.051
Let me go on and get
my young selfie levels up.

02:01:40.634 --> 02:01:42.553
You realize this is classified, right?

02:01:42.636 --> 02:01:44.013
Not today.

02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:47.186
Unbelievable.

02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:49.769
All right, can we get up
outta here, now? I'm freezin'!

02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:18.798
It's okay.

02:02:19.590 --> 02:02:21.717
Don't worry. He's gonna be here soon.

02:02:22.093 --> 02:02:23.844
I get it. Y'all got a lot in common.

02:02:23.928 --> 02:02:26.892
Computer hacks, God's Eye,
geeks, nerd... You know.

02:02:26.972 --> 02:02:28.599
But we got a lot in common, too, right?

02:02:28.683 --> 02:02:29.854
Like what?

02:02:29.934 --> 02:02:33.312
We walk in the room
and we're oozin' sex appeal.

02:02:33.396 --> 02:02:35.648
Me and you, hip to hip, is a problem.

02:02:35.731 --> 02:02:38.150
I'm askin' a real question right now.

02:02:38.234 --> 02:02:41.487
Is it gonna be <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i>

02:02:42.279 --> 02:02:45.950
or <i>The Dark Knight?</i> Huh?

02:02:46.283 --> 02:02:48.285
To be honest, I like both of you.

02:02:51.414 --> 02:02:54.333
But just before we get into all of that,

02:02:54.417 --> 02:02:56.210
let me ask you one question.

02:02:56.293 --> 02:02:58.170
You can ask me anything.

02:02:58.254 --> 02:02:59.380
Anything.

02:02:59.463 --> 02:03:00.798
What's my last name?

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:07.099
When you guys figure it out,
then, I guess you can let me know.

02:03:07.179 --> 02:03:09.849
It's gonna be Parker.
That's all that really matters.

02:03:09.932 --> 02:03:11.267
- Jones.
- Mrs. Parker.

02:03:11.684 --> 02:03:13.644
- Right?
- Hey, Mrs. Parker...

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:15.187
Hey.

02:03:15.271 --> 02:03:16.564
Letty.

02:03:16.647 --> 02:03:18.149
I wanted to thank you.

02:03:18.691 --> 02:03:19.692
No need.

02:03:20.943 --> 02:03:21.944
Well...

02:03:22.278 --> 02:03:24.951
Cipher's still on the loose.
There's been some reports she's in Athens,

02:03:25.031 --> 02:03:27.453
but she won't be nuking
any cities anytime soon.

02:03:27.533 --> 02:03:28.743
Thanks to you guys.

02:03:28.826 --> 02:03:30.953
So, I got you a party favor.

02:03:31.195 --> 02:03:32.580
This can't be good.

02:03:32.663 --> 02:03:35.166
Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.

02:03:35.249 --> 02:03:36.796
You've got your job back.

02:03:36.876 --> 02:03:38.377
That is, if you want it.

02:03:41.797 --> 02:03:42.927
If I want?

02:03:43.007 --> 02:03:44.008
Mmm-hmm.

02:03:50.514 --> 02:03:54.685
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.

02:03:55.311 --> 02:03:56.479
Wow.

02:03:58.064 --> 02:04:00.024
Daddy's stayin' home.

02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:07.573
Nobody.

02:04:07.656 --> 02:04:08.699
Keep in touch.

02:04:09.158 --> 02:04:10.743
Ah. Hang on a second.

02:04:11.077 --> 02:04:13.245
This could be interesting.

02:04:18.367 --> 02:04:19.567
What made you think I'd do it?

02:04:20.544 --> 02:04:21.799
Brotherhood.

02:04:21.879 --> 02:04:25.508
I saw that look you gave Cipher,
knew you wanted revenge.

02:04:25.841 --> 02:04:27.343
Glad I did it.

02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:33.182
I can't believe you went to see my mother.

02:04:48.489 --> 02:04:50.491
All this fuss over you.

02:04:56.497 --> 02:04:57.915
Yes.

02:05:03.004 --> 02:05:06.090
Elena, I promised to keep our son safe.

02:05:08.259 --> 02:05:10.428
And now, he always will be.

02:05:18.561 --> 02:05:22.857
I wanna introduce you to the most
important person in my universe.

02:05:24.525 --> 02:05:26.944
One who never gave up on me.

02:05:32.616 --> 02:05:33.701
He's beautiful.

02:05:35.453 --> 02:05:39.790
You've heard me say that you
never turn your back on family,

02:05:41.751 --> 02:05:45.796
and I wanna thank you all
for never turning your back on me.

02:05:50.384 --> 02:05:51.969
You wanna meet them?

02:05:52.636 --> 02:05:54.138
All right.

02:05:54.972 --> 02:05:56.307
Everyone,

02:05:57.641 --> 02:05:59.060
meet Brian.

02:06:08.319 --> 02:06:09.570
To Brian!

02:06:09.653 --> 02:06:11.530
Welcome to the family, Brian.

02:06:11.614 --> 02:06:14.325
Okay, I guess it's my turn to say grace.

02:06:14.784 --> 02:06:17.290
We thank you for giving us family.

02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:21.749
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
