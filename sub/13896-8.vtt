OH, OH, OH.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.180
JAKE, GOD, I THINK
YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE.

00:16.760 --> 00:17.810
SORRY, B'Y.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.720
THAT PULL-OUT IS KILLING ME.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.480
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WANTED TO PUT A BED IN HERE

00:21.520 --> 00:23.270
BUT THE OLD MAN THINKS
IT'LL SEND THE WRONG SIGNAL

00:23.310 --> 00:24.480
TO THE CLIENTS.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.820
WELL, JAKEY, MAYBE
A BIG BOY APARTMENT'S
IN ORDER.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.280
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE YOUR OWN HOUSE.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.740
ALL DUE RESPECT,

00:33.780 --> 00:36.200
ALLISON, PLEASE JUST
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
WITH ALL THAT.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.950
-FINE.
-OH, NOW DON'T--
LOOK, I JUST--

00:41.000 --> 00:43.500
EVERYONE IN MY LIFE IS
CONSTANTLY GIVING ME CRAP

00:43.540 --> 00:45.000
AND I'D REALLY, REALLY
APPRECIATE IT

00:45.040 --> 00:47.000
IF YOU WEREN'T
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE,
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.090
I'M NOT GIVING YOU CRAP.

00:48.130 --> 00:50.000
YOU ARE, KIND OF.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.460
I'M TIRED, OKAY?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.300
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SLEPT.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.060
JAKE.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.270
COME ON.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.060
WHAT? NOW HOW WAS THAT
MY FAULT--

01:02.100 --> 01:04.480
&lt;SIGHS&gt; LOOK,
I HAVE AN IRON...
SOMEWHERE.

01:04.520 --> 01:05.770
WELL, ACTUALLY
I DON'T OWN ONE.

01:05.810 --> 01:07.770
FORGET IT, OKAY.
I WILL SEE YOU LATER,

01:07.810 --> 01:09.610
OR I DON'T KNOW, WHENEVER.

01:13.110 --> 01:14.070
[JAKE] WHENEVER.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.490
[MARTIN] THAT WAS LOVELY.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.160
I REALLY ENJOYED
BREAKFAST TODAY.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.910
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, ROSE,
REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
THANKS, MAL.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.580
YOU MADE IT
WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.620
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE,
JUST WANTED TO SURPRISE YA.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.620
OH, YOU CERTAINLY DID THAT.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.920
I GOTTA WORK,
SO MAYBE YOU WANT TO, UH...

01:28.960 --> 01:30.750
-YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?
-YEAH.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.510
[MAL] I JUST GOTTA
MEET JAKE DOWNTOWN--

01:32.550 --> 01:34.760
PFF, BIG CASE.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.180
WOW, I AM TOTALLY FREE TODAY.
IT'S WEIRD.

01:37.220 --> 01:38.470
NO CASE, NO WORK, NO NOTHING.

01:39.970 --> 01:41.470
IS HE HOLDING YOU
HOSTAGE OR SOMETHING?

01:41.510 --> 01:43.810
BY THE WAY, CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE RECENT NUPTIALS,

01:43.850 --> 01:47.350
I HEARD ALL ABOUT IT.
I WANT TO WISH YOU BOTH
ALL THE HAPPINESS.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.900
-THANK YOU.
-WE APPRECIATE IT.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.270
BUT, IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
IN THE MORNING

01:50.320 --> 01:52.150
FOR THE THREE OF
YOU TO BE DRINKING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

01:52.190 --> 01:53.230
WELL, MARTIN SURPRISED US.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.900
-&lt;SNIFFS&gt;
-MADE US BREAKFAST.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.360
I GOT A CONFESSION TO MAKE.
I ACTUALLY DO HAVE
AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE.

01:57.410 --> 01:59.070
-GET OUT.
-I DO.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.160
NO, I MEAN GET OUT.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.410
I GOT A BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU.

02:01.450 --> 02:02.580
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR IT,
OR NOT?

02:02.620 --> 02:03.870
-BUSINESS?
-YEAH.

02:03.910 --> 02:05.210
PRETTY GOOD BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY, TOO.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.370
COULD MAKE US ALL RICH.

02:06.410 --> 02:07.870
TRUST ME.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.750
SOUNDS GREAT... NO.

02:09.790 --> 02:11.750
YOU MIGHT WANNA LEAVE,
YOU DON'T WANNA MAKE HIM MAD.

02:11.790 --> 02:14.510
BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE,
300 GRAND CAN CALM
ANYBODY DOWN.

02:14.550 --> 02:17.180
WH-WH-WH-WH-WHOA.
WAIT NOW, WAIT NOW.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.890
WHAT?

02:18.930 --> 02:21.720
300 THOUSAND DOLLARS?
JUST LET THE MAN TALK.

02:21.760 --> 02:23.390
HERE'S ME
WITHOUT MY PITCH NOTES.

02:23.430 --> 02:24.220
JAKE? WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

02:24.270 --> 02:26.230
JUST-- CAN'T YOU HEAR
THE MAN TALKING?

02:26.270 --> 02:29.400
I GOT A PICTURE OF A WOMAN
CALLED TONI BURKE,
SHE'S AN ACCOUNTANT.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.610
SHE HANDLES ALL THESE
REAL HOTSHOT CLIENTS.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.690
AND WHAT SHE DID WAS
SHE'S EMBEZZLED MILLIONS

02:33.730 --> 02:36.400
AND NOW THERE'S
A MASSIVE REWARD OUT THERE
FOR HER.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.360
LET ME GUESS,
SHE JUST HAPPENS TO
BE IN TOWN RIGHT NOW?

02:39.410 --> 02:40.570
YOU SHOULD DO THIS
FOR A LIVING.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.330
YES, SHE'S HERE
FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS ONLY.

02:43.370 --> 02:44.830
DO WE LOOK LIKE
BOUNTY HUNTERS?

02:44.870 --> 02:47.210
300 THOUSAND DOLLARS
AND YOU CAN LOOK LIKE
WHAT YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.870
-OH, MARTIN.
-COME ON.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.120
I JUST WANT
A LITTLE ADVENTURE.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.040
PLUS, I CAN
USE YOUR HELP ON THIS.

02:52.090 --> 02:53.170
-WHAT DO YOU SAY?
-[JAKE] OKAY,

02:53.210 --> 02:54.210
WHO DID SHE ROB
THE MONEY FROM?

02:54.250 --> 02:55.800
HER EMPLOYERS, I GUESS.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.340
THE POINT IS THAT SHE'S HERE,
SHE'S UP FOR GRABS,

02:58.380 --> 02:59.720
IF WE MAKE A MOVE
RIGHT NOW

02:59.760 --> 03:01.220
WE CAN CAPITALIZE ON IT.

03:01.260 --> 03:02.350
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

03:02.390 --> 03:03.430
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

03:03.470 --> 03:05.390
UH, JUST-- GIVE US A SEC.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.600
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.310
I FOR ONE, ACTUALLY,
KINDA BELIEVE HIM.

03:11.350 --> 03:12.690
YOU SHOULD HAVE
MORE FAITH IN PEOPLE.

03:12.730 --> 03:13.900
HE GOT ME
THROWN IN JAIL LAST YEAR.

03:13.940 --> 03:16.440
JAKE, NOTHING IS EVER
AS IT SEEMS WITH HIM.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.360
LOOK, I'M A BIG BOY.
I KNOW I CAN HANDLE HIM.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.240
YOU GUYS DON'T
WANT TO DO THIS,

03:19.280 --> 03:20.360
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.

03:20.410 --> 03:21.450
YEAH, HE CAN'T BE ALL BAD.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.530
OKAY, SO WE'RE GOOD THEN?

03:23.570 --> 03:26.330
-PARTNERS?
-LET'S NOT GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES.

03:26.370 --> 03:28.080
OKAY, BUT I'M WATCHING YA.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.330
AND, JAKE, I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.040

03:32.080 --> 03:33.290
PARTNER.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.340

03:58.690 --> 04:01.570
[MARTIN]
TONI BURKE HAS MANAGED TO SKIM

04:01.610 --> 04:05.410
A COOL 3 MILLION BUCKS
OFF THE BOOKS...

04:05.450 --> 04:07.410
FROM WHO SHE WAS WORKING FOR.

04:07.450 --> 04:11.370
SO 10% OF UH--
THAT'S A FINDER'S FEE, 300K.

04:11.410 --> 04:12.790
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AFTER.

04:12.830 --> 04:16.000
SHE'S AT THE AIRPORT,
LEAVING FOR MEXICO...

04:16.040 --> 04:17.130
SO LET'S CALL IT 11 HOURS.

04:17.170 --> 04:18.500
SO JUST SIT AND WAIT FOR HER
AT THE AIRPORT.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.760
NO, NO, NO.
ANYONE COULD JUST SNATCH HER.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.550
THERE'S 300 GRAND ON THE LINE,
WE GOTTA MOVE NOW.

04:22.590 --> 04:23.760
LIKE HOW YOU THINK.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.260
THE REWARD IS LEGIT,
IT'S ON THE FED'S WEBSITE.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.560
THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HER
FOR ALMOST A YEAR,

04:27.600 --> 04:28.770
BUT THEY'RE NOT SAYING WHY.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.350
TOP SECRET STUFF,
EMBEZZLEMENT.

04:30.390 --> 04:32.310
[JAKE]
THIS TONI, SHE DOESN'T LOOK
MUCH LIKE A CROOK TO ME.

04:32.350 --> 04:33.900
OR AN ACCOUNTANT.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.650
WAY BETTER LOOKING
THAN WHOEVER DOES YOUR TAXES.

04:35.690 --> 04:37.520
I DO OUR TAXES.

04:37.570 --> 04:38.730
-I STAND CORRECTED.
-MMM-HMM.

04:38.780 --> 04:40.320
[MARTIN] SHE'S TRAVELING
WITH HER SISTER.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.360
SISTER'S NAME IS
SIOBHAN MCDONAGH.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.450
I HAVEN'T GOT
A PICTURE OF HER.

04:44.490 --> 04:45.820
WELL, SHE APPEARS
TO BE A GHOST.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.330
SHE'S NOT ON ANY
HOTEL REGISTRIES

04:47.370 --> 04:48.370
OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THIS CITY.

04:48.410 --> 04:50.120
SHE'S A GAMBLER,
TOTAL DEGENERATE.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.370
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?

04:51.410 --> 04:53.330
WELL, I'VE BEEN WORKING
ALL THE ANGLES ON THIS CASE.

04:53.370 --> 04:54.920
BEFORE I BROUGHT IT TO YOU
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

04:54.960 --> 04:56.790
IT WAS 100% LEGIT.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.420
AND YOU CAN ID THIS UH--

04:58.460 --> 05:00.380
-THIS SISTER, SIOBHAN?
-ABSOLUTELY.

05:00.420 --> 05:01.460
DID YOU COLOR YOUR HAIR?

05:02.170 --> 05:03.840
YEAH. HOW DO I LOOK?

05:03.880 --> 05:05.590
-VERY HANDSOME.
-HEY, THANK YOU.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.090
NOW WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.810
I HAVEN'T GOT A PLAN.
YOU GUYS ARE
THE PRIVATE DETECTIVES.

05:08.850 --> 05:09.930
I'M JUST BRINING IT TO YOU.

05:09.970 --> 05:11.020
THE ONLY THING I CAN OFFER IS,

05:11.060 --> 05:12.770
I HAVE A CERTAIN, YOU KNOW,

05:12.810 --> 05:13.850
FEELING FOR THE LAW.

05:13.890 --> 05:15.520
AND FROM THE WRONG SIDE OF IT,
YOU MEAN.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.360
WELL, DON'T--
NO NEED TO BE JUDGMENTAL
ABOUT IT.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.190
IT DOES GIVE YOU
A CERTAIN INSIGHT,
GOTTA ADMIT THAT.

05:19.230 --> 05:20.270
[JAKE] YOU WANNA
WORK WITH US,

05:20.320 --> 05:22.150
YOU DO WHAT WE SAY,
ALL THE TIME,

05:22.190 --> 05:23.530
AND WE'LL GET ALONG FINE.

05:23.570 --> 05:24.950
-OKAY, THANKS.
-[ROSE] YEAH,
AND IF WE FIND OUT

05:24.990 --> 05:26.110
THAT YOU'RE MESSIN' WITH US--

05:26.160 --> 05:27.240
I WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT, OKAY?

05:27.280 --> 05:28.410
I WANT TO DO IT YOUR WAY.

05:28.450 --> 05:29.450
AS MY HAND TO GOD.

05:30.540 --> 05:32.290
CAN I PUT MY PICTURE UP? OKAY?

05:32.330 --> 05:34.540
ALL RIGHT.
IF TONI'S IN TOWN,

05:34.580 --> 05:36.290
WE JUST GOTTA PAPER HER
PICTURE AROUND,

05:36.330 --> 05:37.500
SHOW IT TO SOME FRIENDS.

05:37.540 --> 05:39.540
I MEAN, IF SHE'S IN THE CITY,
SHE CAN'T BE THAT HARD
TO TRACK.

05:39.590 --> 05:40.710
WE APPREHEND HER,

05:40.750 --> 05:42.420
TURN HER OVER
TO THE LOCAL GUYS
FOR THE REWARD.

05:42.460 --> 05:43.550
SIMPLE.

05:43.590 --> 05:45.630
SO THE MYSTERY GAL,
UH, SIOBHAN,

05:45.680 --> 05:47.140
YOU SAY SHE'S A GAMBLER?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.430
OH, SHE LIKES CRAPS.

05:48.470 --> 05:50.560
SHE LOVES CRAPS.
IT'S THE ONLY GAME SHE PLAYS.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.720
IT'S A BIT EARLY, BUT...

05:51.760 --> 05:54.100
THERE'S ONLY ONE GUY
WHO'D BE RUNNING A GAME
AT THIS TIME OF DAY.

05:54.140 --> 05:55.270
-&lt;FINGERS SNAPPING&gt;
-ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

05:55.310 --> 05:56.600
I GOTTA GO, UH, DO SOMETHING.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.900
I WON'T BE LONG, I PROMISE.

05:57.940 --> 06:00.610
YOU GONNA BE OKAY
WITH YOUR NEW BFF,

06:00.650 --> 06:01.980
THE HANDSOME EX-CON?

06:02.020 --> 06:04.190
I THINK I LIKED HIM BETTER
WHEN HE WAS TRYIN' TO STEAL
MY WIFE.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.490
STANDING RIGHT HERE, GUYS.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.070
I'LL SEE YA.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.580
&lt;GROANING&gt; UGH! AH!

06:13.620 --> 06:14.700
-YOU GIVE?

06:16.370 --> 06:18.000
GOOD, YOU ASKED FOR IT
AND I'M BRINING IT.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.580
OH, I CAN TAKE IT,
I CAN TAKE IT.

06:19.630 --> 06:20.460
SEE, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.630
SEE, JAKE WILL NEVER
TAKE ME SERIOUSLY

06:21.670 --> 06:23.420
UNTIL, LIKE--
UNTIL HE UNDERSTANDS

06:23.460 --> 06:25.800
MY PHYSICAL PROWESS.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.340
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
A CAGE FIGHTER.

06:27.380 --> 06:29.140
TRUE, I SUFFER FROM
DIS-COORDINATION.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.180
AND...

06:31.220 --> 06:32.430
WELL, FEAR.

06:32.470 --> 06:34.640
-BUT, I CAN GET PAST IT.
-WE'LL WHIP YOU INTO SHAPE.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.770
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
YOU READY? YOU READY?

06:36.810 --> 06:38.060
HERE WE GO.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.690
&lt;GROANS&gt;

06:40.730 --> 06:44.110
I THINK I SMELL TOAST.
I DEFINITELY SMELL TOAST.

06:44.150 --> 06:46.780
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, A P.I.'S

06:46.820 --> 06:48.530
SO-- SO YOU GOTTA BE ABLE
TO TAKE A PUNCH

06:48.570 --> 06:49.780
AS WELL AS THROW ONE.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.160
&lt;GROANING&gt; AH! AH!

06:52.200 --> 06:53.580
AT THIS RATE,
YOU'LL TAKE PLENTY.

06:53.620 --> 06:55.160
-YOU CAN'T HALF-ASS
THIS KIND OF THING...
-&lt;PANTING&gt;

06:55.200 --> 06:57.710
...OR JAKE WILL NEVER SEE YOU
AS MORE THAN A LITTLE BROTHER.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.420
A LITTLE BROTHER? REALLY?
DID HE SAY THAT?

07:00.540 --> 07:01.460
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,

07:01.500 --> 07:03.590
I'M NOT LIKE A,
A SIBLING TO YOU, AM I?

07:03.630 --> 07:05.760
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT? NO.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.050
-WHY?
-NO REASON.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.130
&lt;BOTH GRUNT&gt;

07:08.170 --> 07:09.220

07:09.260 --> 07:11.220
&lt;CHUCKLING&gt;
YOU LIKE THAT? I GOT YA.

07:12.970 --> 07:13.970
NICE ONE.

07:18.390 --> 07:20.350
-&lt;DES GROANS&gt;
-TOO SLOW, COURTNEY.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.770

23:18.810 --> 23:20.150

23:20.190 --> 23:22.360
SMALL VICTORIES
SEEM TO SPAWN HER ADDICTION.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.030
OBVIOUSLY SHE'LL BE BACK.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.820

24:23.710 --> 24:25.090
TRY NOT TO WORRY.

I PUT A BUG IN JAKE'S PHONE

25:14.880 --> 25:17.180

25:26.650 --> 25:28.110
-MAL, MAL.

25:42.580 --> 25:44.330
YEAH WELL,
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE...

25:45.580 --> 25:46.710
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

25:47.500 --> 25:49.090
BEING CHASED BY BIKERS,

25:50.050 --> 25:51.590
A BOUNTY HUNTER,

25:51.630 --> 25:54.380
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT
TO GET A MARRIAGE
ALL SPICED UP.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.800
HE'S NOT LIKE THAT.
HE'S-- HE'S, UM...

25:56.840 --> 25:58.050
CREEPY EX-CON?

25:58.090 --> 25:59.850
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

25:59.890 --> 26:01.810
NO! NO, JAKE.

26:01.850 --> 26:03.220
WE WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.640
THE MOMENT WE MET,

26:05.690 --> 26:06.810
WE WERE IN LOVE.

26:06.850 --> 26:07.810
REALLY?

26:07.850 --> 26:09.560
WE FIGHT LIKE PIT BULLS, BUT--

26:10.730 --> 26:11.820
MMM.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.440
HE PUSHES ME
AND THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

26:13.490 --> 26:14.860
HE PUSHES ME, AND YOU KNOW,

26:14.900 --> 26:17.660
HE MAKES ME A BETTER PERSON.

26:17.700 --> 26:20.660
AND, EVERYONE SHOULD BE

26:20.700 --> 26:23.120
AS LUCKY AS I AM
TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.700
YEAH, WELL,

26:24.750 --> 26:26.080
WHATEVER FLOATS YOUR BOBBER.

26:27.870 --> 26:29.630
PEOPLE THINK
THAT THEY'RE IN LOVE,

26:29.670 --> 26:32.000
AND THEN IT ACTUALLY
HAPPENS TO 'EM.

26:32.710 --> 26:34.090
AND IT'S AMAZING.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.760
MAYBE IT'S HAPPENED TO YOU.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.140
YEAH.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.640

26:59.860 --> 27:00.910
BUT HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT GONNA

27:00.950 --> 27:02.580

IT'S OKAY.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.310
IT'S NOTHING TO BE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

27:34.730 --> 27:36.360
LET'S JUST GET HIM
IN THE CAR, OKAY?

27:36.820 --> 27:37.860

28:00.630 --> 28:02.590
OH MAN, MARTIN.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.810

SHE'S A REAL DOLL.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.640
[MARTIN] OKAY, WHERE'S TONI?
WHERE DID SHE GO?

28:08.220 --> 28:09.310

28:11.600 --> 28:14.190
SHE BASHED ME IN THE HEAD,
AND THEN SHE BAILED.

28:14.940 --> 28:17.110
THAT'S HER.
SHE'S GOT TRUST ISSUES.

28:17.150 --> 28:18.780
WE GOTTA FIND HER
BEFORE THE BIKERS FIND HER.

28:18.820 --> 28:21.030
YEAH, ROSE TOOK DES
TO THE HOSPITAL.

28:21.070 --> 28:22.410

28:23.620 --> 28:24.820

28:24.870 --> 28:26.120
GOTTA FIND HER.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.740
THINK IT MIGHT WORK.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.160
IT'S OUR ONLY OPTION.

28:31.790 --> 28:32.790
GUYS, I NEED A RIDE.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.380
[JAKE]
I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE HER,

28:37.130 --> 28:38.800
BUT I THINK I CAN GET HER.

28:39.420 --> 28:40.970
YOU'RE HARBORING A FUGITIVE.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.720
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
OF TROUBLE YOU'RE IN?

28:42.760 --> 28:45.140
I THINK I HAVE A, UM--
A SOLUTION,

28:45.180 --> 28:48.640
THAT WILL BENEFIT
BOTH MUTUAL PARTIES.

28:48.680 --> 28:49.970
-IS THAT RIGHT?
-YES.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.600
YOU JUST HAVE TO
HEAR ME OUT, OKAY?

28:51.640 --> 28:52.850
OKAY, SO,

28:52.890 --> 28:54.810
TONI NEEDS TO TESTIFY
AGAINST THE BIKERS, RIGHT?

28:54.850 --> 28:55.900
IN MONTREAL.

28:55.940 --> 28:58.730
SO, WHAT IF WE SET A TRAP

28:58.780 --> 29:00.780
TO LURE OUT THE BIKER DUDE.

29:00.820 --> 29:02.900
AND THEN YOU CAPTURE HIM,

29:02.950 --> 29:04.860
AND THEN YOU GET TONI.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.490
BUT YOU GOTTA PROMISE,
THOUGH, THAT, UH,

29:06.530 --> 29:08.370
TONI AND MARTIN,
THEY'LL BE SAFE.

29:08.410 --> 29:11.540
AND YOU PUT THEM IN,
LIKE A WITNESS--

29:11.580 --> 29:13.410
A PROTECTION OR SOMETHING.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.000
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'VE BEEN
TRYING TO DO, JAKE.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.550
THIS IS A HUGE CASE
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER,

29:18.590 --> 29:21.010
AND WE NEED HER TESTIMONY

29:21.050 --> 29:22.760
NO PROBLEM.
I JUST GOTTA FIND HER

29:22.800 --> 29:24.220
BEFORE THE BOUNTY HUNTER
FINDS HER.

29:24.260 --> 29:25.930

FIND HER.

29:28.850 --> 29:29.890

29:30.560 --> 29:31.560
ARE YOU DRUNK?

29:32.180 --> 29:33.180

29:34.640 --> 29:36.810
IT WAS A WORK DRINKING THING.

29:36.850 --> 29:37.860
DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.570
&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

29:45.070 --> 29:46.280

BUT, YOU JUST GIVE ME AN HOUR

29:57.420 --> 29:58.840
AND I--
I WILL, UM,

29:59.540 --> 30:00.710
SORT THIS OUT.

30:00.750 --> 30:01.880
OKAY?

30:03.090 --> 30:07.180
OKAY, I HAVE BEEN DRINKING
A LITTLE BIT, OBVIOUSLY.

30:07.220 --> 30:09.890
AND I JUST,
I NEED TO GET A CAB.

30:09.930 --> 30:11.390
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

30:15.890 --> 30:17.650
&lt;JAKE CLEARS THROAT&gt;

30:27.490 --> 30:28.660
MARTIN.

30:31.370 --> 30:32.490
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

30:32.540 --> 30:34.290
I'M SORRY, JAKE.
I DIDN'T GET MUCH CHOICE.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.750
&lt;BIRD SCREECHING&gt;

30:43.380 --> 30:45.010
WHERE'S THE GIRL?

30:45.050 --> 30:47.680
OH, BUDDY.
YOU GOT SERIOUS ANGER ISSUES.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.890
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE READY
FOR A GIRLFRIEND RIGHT NOW.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.430
[MARTIN] WHAT DID I DO?

30:53.470 --> 30:55.100
LOOK, IF YOU WANT A GIRL,
I GOT HER NUMBER
IN MY PHONE, I'LL--

30:57.440 --> 30:59.190
WE CAN DO THIS ALL DAY.

30:59.230 --> 31:02.150
BUT THIS, THE BLUNT END
OF THIS IS GONNA BREAK
YOUR SHINS.

31:02.190 --> 31:03.690
IF I KNEW ANYTHING,
I'D TELL YA.

31:03.730 --> 31:05.230
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'M NOT REALLY THE STRONG,
SILENT TYPE.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.820
&lt;KNOCKING ON DOOR&gt;

31:06.860 --> 31:08.910
-[LESLIE] JAKE,
WOULD YOU OPEN THE DOOR?
-SHH. SHH.

31:08.950 --> 31:09.910
[LESLIE] I CAN HEAR YOU
IN THERE.

31:09.950 --> 31:11.160
&lt;KNIFE CLICKS&gt;

31:11.200 --> 31:12.780
CAN WE JUST TALK? PLEASE.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.410
&lt;WHISPERS&gt; DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.630
LET'S GO.

31:30.550 --> 31:33.300
SAY THE WRONG THING
AND THE FIRST BULLET'S GOING
INTO HER HEAD.

31:38.520 --> 31:39.940
&lt;JAKE CLEARS THROAT&gt;

31:39.980 --> 31:41.980
THIS IS NOT REALLY A VERY
GOOD TIME.

31:42.020 --> 31:43.900
[LESLIE] LOOK, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID WHAT I SAID.

31:43.940 --> 31:47.190
I'M OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE
SENSITIVE WHEN IT COMES
TO US, SO.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.950
ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

31:52.240 --> 31:55.030
UH, SLEPT FUNNY.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.250
&lt;SIGHS&gt; YEAH, I SHOULD REALLY

31:57.290 --> 31:58.870
GET BACK TO WHAT
I WAS DOING, SO--

32:00.000 --> 32:03.130
OH, YOU'RE NOT ALONE. SORRY.

32:03.170 --> 32:06.960
I AM ALONE.
I AM ALONE, I'M ALONE.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.130
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

32:08.170 --> 32:10.590
YEAH, THIS? NO, I JUST--
&lt;SCOFFS&gt;

32:10.630 --> 32:12.220
I WOKE UP AND I-- YOU KNOW ME,
I'M AN IDIOT,

32:12.260 --> 32:14.640
I FELL OVER,
AND I SMACKED MY HEAD.

32:16.140 --> 32:18.180
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT I'M SORRY

32:18.220 --> 32:21.270
AND I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE,

32:21.310 --> 32:24.110
AND JAKE, YOU WERE,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.900
NO, NO. I'M NEVER RIGHT.
THAT'S JUST CRAZY TALK.

32:26.940 --> 32:30.240
I WAS THINKING. I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

32:30.280 --> 32:33.110
ABOUT US.
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

32:34.370 --> 32:35.490
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS, JAKE?

32:35.530 --> 32:36.990
WHY ARE WE HIDING
FROM THE TRUTH?

32:38.240 --> 32:40.040
IT'S STUPID.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.170
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT WHAT IF?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.750
YOU AND ME, I MEAN.

32:46.710 --> 32:49.130
&lt;CLICKS TONGUE&gt; NO.

32:51.220 --> 32:54.640
I HAVEN'T. SO, GO AWAY NOW.

32:55.470 --> 32:57.390
&lt;SCOFFS&gt; WHAT?

32:57.430 --> 32:59.060
[JAKE] JUST GO AWAY.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.560
LESLIE, I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.310
GO AWAY, GO AWAY. BYE. SEE YA.

33:03.350 --> 33:05.020

AND YOU, UM,

33:10.280 --> 33:13.240
YOU KIND OF BROKE
MY HEART, SO.

33:13.280 --> 33:18.790
WHAT'S LEFT TO, UH,
DEBATE ABOUT, RIGHT?

33:22.250 --> 33:24.540
JUST, LIKE YOU TO LEAVE.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.010
LEAVE! PLEASE.

33:31.380 --> 33:33.420
I'M SORRY.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.100
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

33:41.390 --> 33:42.390
THAT WAS HEAVY, MAN.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.230
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

33:44.270 --> 33:45.520
YEAH, WELL--

33:45.560 --> 33:46.980
REALLY.

33:47.020 --> 33:49.230
WHY DON'T YOU GO
SCREW YOURSELF?

33:49.270 --> 33:51.980
NICE, NICE! GO!
GO RIGHT NOW.

33:52.650 --> 33:54.610
FIND HER. FIND TONI!

33:56.660 --> 33:58.530
&lt;INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS&gt;

33:58.570 --> 34:00.790
&lt;SOBBING&gt;

34:23.430 --> 34:25.270
&lt;EXHALES DEEPLY&gt;

34:31.980 --> 34:33.990
[ALLISON] MMM-HMM. YES.

34:34.990 --> 34:37.200
MMM-HMM.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.370
YES, OF COURSE, MR. MAYOR.
I AGREE.

34:39.410 --> 34:43.080
I WOULD HATE TO SEE THE R.N.C.
LOOK FOOLISH ON YOUR WATCH.

34:43.120 --> 34:47.620
YES, IF THE DOYLES FIND HER,
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO LEAN
ON THEM.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.500
WELL, THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM.

34:50.540 --> 34:53.380
THEY NEED TO LEARN
THAT THEY CAN'T MESS WITH
THE RESPECT OF THE R.N.C.

34:54.550 --> 34:57.180
YES, WELL,
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

34:57.220 --> 35:01.640
YEAH-- YOU JUST LET ME WORRY
ABOUT JAKE DOYLE.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.440
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

35:17.240 --> 35:19.200
&lt;EXHALES DEEPLY&gt;

35:22.330 --> 35:24.200
&lt;DOOR CLOSES&gt;

35:24.240 --> 35:25.620
[JAKE] TONI,

35:25.660 --> 35:28.250
I GOTTA SEE YOU RIGHT NOW.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.710
TONI!

35:33.750 --> 35:35.210
OH, MY GOD, WHAT--
ARE YOU OKAY?

35:35.250 --> 35:37.760
YEAH, YEAH,
NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT.
LOOK, HE'S GOT YOUR HUSBAND.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.840
AND IF YOU WANT HIM TO LIVE,
WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE OPTION.

35:40.890 --> 35:42.010
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.350
&lt;PANTING&gt;

35:49.270 --> 35:51.810
YEAH, IT'S, UH, ME.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.190
I'VE GOT WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

35:53.230 --> 35:55.190
WE NEED TO MAKE A TRADE.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.280
[RICK] NO ONE NEEDS
TO GET SHOT.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.910
THE OLD MAN FOR THE GIRL,
LIKE YOU SAID ON THE PHONE.

36:04.950 --> 36:07.410
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE,
I DON'T WANT HER
INVOLVED WITH THIS.

36:07.450 --> 36:08.330
WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.460
WE, UH, GOT A SLIGHT CHANGE
IN, UH, PLAN HERE.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.210
STILL DO A TRADE.

36:14.250 --> 36:15.590
BUT I DON'T WANT THIS TOOL.

36:15.630 --> 36:17.420
YOU KNOW WHAT A PAIN
IN THE ASS HE'S BEEN?

36:17.460 --> 36:18.260
WE HAD A DEAL.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.170
I KNOW WE HAVE A DEAL,
BUT I HAVE DEBTS.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.340
YOU WANT CASH? SURE.

36:21.380 --> 36:22.300
NO, NO, NO, NO CASH, OKAY?

36:22.340 --> 36:25.100
I CAN'T TRUST THAT IT'S NOT
SOME COUNTERFEIT CRAP

36:25.140 --> 36:26.390
THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAND OFF
TO ME, OR,

36:26.430 --> 36:28.220
OR MARKED BILLS OR SOMETHING.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.480
I WANT COCAINE.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.730
AW, COME ON.

36:30.770 --> 36:32.020
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

36:32.060 --> 36:34.400
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION.
YOU'RE A HIGH ROLLER, RIGHT?

36:34.440 --> 36:35.770
YOU MUST HAVE A COUPLE OF

36:35.820 --> 36:37.940
BRICKS OF COKE
BACK THERE WORTH
AT LEAST 100 GRAND.

36:37.980 --> 36:40.320
YEAH, THEY'RE GONNA KILL HER.
DON'T YOU GET HOW THAT WORKS?

36:40.360 --> 36:42.280
ALL RIGHT. IT DOESN'T MATTER.

36:42.320 --> 36:44.620
YOU WON'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH
TO SELL IT.

36:45.490 --> 36:47.950
[JAKE] YEAH, WELL, I'LL WAIT.

36:47.990 --> 36:50.410
COME ON, JAKE.
MAKE HIM SING.

36:51.790 --> 36:53.500
HE BETTER NOT SCREW
THIS UP, MALACHY.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.210
AH, HE'LL GET IT DONE.

36:56.750 --> 36:59.010
I FEEL LIKE
I'M AT THE KID'S TABLE AGAIN.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.130
YOU KNOW,
IF I HADN'T LET MARTIN

37:00.170 --> 37:01.420
TALK ME INTO GOING
INTO A CASINO,

37:01.470 --> 37:03.090
THEY'D BE LONG GONE BY NOW.

37:03.130 --> 37:04.430
ACTUALLY, YEAH,
IT KINDA IS YOUR FAULT.

37:04.470 --> 37:05.970
WHAT DO I DO?

37:06.010 --> 37:08.430
I DON'T KNOW, DES.
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING
TO EARN JAKE'S RESPECT,

37:08.470 --> 37:09.270
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO STEP IT UP.

37:11.350 --> 37:12.940
I'M JUST GIVING YOU
THE GEARS, BUD.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.400
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT SO MUCH.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.480
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.900
HOLY CRAP,
HOLY CRAP, HOLY CRAP.

37:17.940 --> 37:20.820
ISN'T THAT THE, THE BOUNTY
HUNTER LADY WHO TASERED ME?

37:20.860 --> 37:22.320
-YEAH, THAT'S HER.
-MAN OH MAN.

37:22.360 --> 37:23.650
CHILL OUT.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.070
SHE'S GOING TO RUIN
THE WHOLE STING.

37:25.110 --> 37:26.740
OKAY, YOU, UH-- YOU WAIT HERE.

37:26.780 --> 37:27.870
&lt;TASER CHARGING&gt;

37:27.910 --> 37:28.950
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT--

37:28.990 --> 37:30.040
DES?

37:30.080 --> 37:31.330
I'M THE KIND OF GUY
THAT BRINGS A TASER

37:31.370 --> 37:33.080
TO A TASER FIGHT,
YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW?

37:33.120 --> 37:34.330
YOU CAN'T AFFORD
THE BRAIN CELLS

37:34.370 --> 37:35.670
IF SHE ZAPS YOU AGAIN!

37:41.760 --> 37:43.510
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

37:43.550 --> 37:45.260
DO YOU ENJOY HURTING OTHERS?

37:45.300 --> 37:46.470
WHAT?

37:46.510 --> 37:47.800
I'M HERE TO SAY NO.

37:47.850 --> 37:50.600
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
AND THE WORLD HAS TOO.

37:50.640 --> 37:51.810
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:57.560 --> 38:00.520
UH. UH. AHH, TINNY!

38:00.570 --> 38:02.690
[MARTIN] I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SELLING ME OUT.

38:02.740 --> 38:05.400
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HER,
I SWEAR TO GOD, I'LL GET YOU.

38:05.450 --> 38:06.610
SHUT UP.

38:08.490 --> 38:09.830
THERE YOU GO.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.660
THAT'LL NET YOU
100 THOUSAND DOLLARS.

38:11.700 --> 38:13.120
YOU'LL NEVER GET
A CHANCE TO SELL IT.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.540
WHAT IS IT?

38:14.580 --> 38:16.500
IT'S COCAINE. IT'S THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE YOU EVER MADE.

38:16.540 --> 38:18.210
HAND OVER THE GIRL!

38:18.250 --> 38:19.290
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE
DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.380
I MEAN, EXCEPT FOR
THE PART WHERE YOU WERE,

38:21.420 --> 38:23.090
YOU KNOW,
BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

38:23.130 --> 38:24.510
YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:24.550 --> 38:27.260
ABSOLUTELY. IN 3, 2, 1.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.310
AW! IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME
IF THAT HAD WORKED.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.350
PUT YOUR GUN DOWN, NOW!

38:34.390 --> 38:35.850
PUT THE GUN DOWN NOW. FREEZE!

38:35.890 --> 38:37.140

38:37.190 --> 38:38.730
[POLICE] PUT IT DOWN! NOW!

38:38.770 --> 38:40.400
MARTIN!

38:40.440 --> 38:43.230
HA-HA. HEY BABY,
HOW YOU DOIN'?

38:43.280 --> 38:44.490
THAT WAS GREAT.

38:44.530 --> 38:45.990
BEAUTIFULLY. I KNEW IT,

38:46.030 --> 38:49.030
I KNEW HE WAS PULLING
SOMETHING HERE.

38:49.070 --> 38:50.200
[POLICE] GOT
ANYTHING ELSE ON YOU?

38:50.240 --> 38:51.530
WE GOT A SET OF
BRACELETS HERE FOR YOU--

38:52.410 --> 38:53.950
I KNEW YOU HAD
A PLAY ON THERE.

38:53.990 --> 38:55.080
DID YOU SEE
HOW I BACKED IT UP?

38:55.790 --> 38:57.580
YEAH, YOU WERE A REAL PRO.

38:57.620 --> 38:59.250
SO WERE YOU.

39:00.750 --> 39:02.290
YOU WANT TO SO BAD?

39:02.340 --> 39:03.380
YEAH, YOU WANT TO
SHOOT? GO AHEAD.

39:03.420 --> 39:04.960
LESLIE, DON'T SHOOT.
DON'T SHOOT.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.380
HOLD FIRE.

39:06.420 --> 39:08.300
ALL RIGHT, I GOT
A WAY OUT OF THIS.
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

39:08.340 --> 39:09.390
PUT THE GUN DOWN, MARTIN!

39:09.430 --> 39:10.720
[MARTIN] ANYBODY
FOLLOWS ME AND

39:10.760 --> 39:13.430
I'LL STICK ONE RIGHT IN HIS
DUMBASS HEAD. YOU GOT THAT?

39:13.470 --> 39:14.720
LET YOUR LITTLE
BUDDIES KNOW, TOO.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.520
YEAH, YOU'RE DRIVING.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.200
[MARTIN] OKAY,
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

39:37.620 --> 39:39.330
SORRY ABOUT
THE CHEAP THEATRICS

39:39.370 --> 39:41.540
BUT I REALLY HAD TO
MAKE IT LOOK REAL.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.340
YEAH, WELL, YOU COULD HAVE
JUST ASKED ME FOR A RIDE.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.210
PLUS, THERE'S NO
BULLETS IN THE GUN.

39:48.630 --> 39:50.840
WHY WOULD YOU
TAKE A GUN LIKE THIS

39:50.890 --> 39:52.970
TO THE O-K CORRAL
WITH NO BULLETS IN IT?

39:53.010 --> 39:55.600
I DON'T LIKE BULLETS.
OR GUNS, REALLY.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.890
FOR ME AND TONI,
THIS IS IT, JAKE.

39:56.930 --> 39:58.680
UH, THIS IS OUR
ONE LAST CHANCE.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.190
NOW YOUR GAG
WORKED PRETTY GOOD
WITH THE COKE THERE,

40:00.230 --> 40:02.400
YOU DREW THE GUY OUT.

40:02.440 --> 40:03.480
NOW YOUR COP GIRLFRIEND THERE,

40:03.520 --> 40:05.770
IF SHE CAN'T FLIP THIS GUY,
NOBODY CAN. RIGHT?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.190
YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE
RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.400
YEAH, SO WE'RE COOL.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.360
COPS DON'T NEED ME ANYMORE.

40:10.780 --> 40:11.860
WE ARE COOL.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.580
SORRY ABOUT THE WINE BOTTLE.
COULDN'T BE SURE.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.740
OH, MAKE SURE
YOU SAY GOODBYE TO MAL
AND ROSE FOR ME, WILL YA?

40:16.790 --> 40:20.830
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
AND LISTEN, UH, ENJOY MEXICO.

40:20.870 --> 40:23.420
[MARTIN] THANK YOU!

40:24.840 --> 40:26.170
[MARTIN] WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

40:26.210 --> 40:27.250
[TONI] I'M DRIVING--

40:27.300 --> 40:28.840
YEAH, DAD. IT'S DONE.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.630
IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.

40:33.090 --> 40:34.470
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

40:34.510 --> 40:36.220
DON'T KNOW WHY YOU INSIST
ON NEVER PUTTING
BULLETS IN A GUN,

40:36.260 --> 40:39.230
BUT IT WAS A GOOD PLAN.
NICE WORK, SON.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.430
WHAT A DAY.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.650
OH, NEVER A DULL MOMENT.

40:43.940 --> 40:45.270
WHAT'S THIS?

40:47.360 --> 40:49.240
ADMIT IT, YOU HAD FUN. MARTIN.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.650
P.S. I.O.U. 300 THOUSAND.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.030
WHATEVER.
I'M JUST GLAD HE'S GONE.

40:54.070 --> 40:56.200
UGH. ME TOO. ME TOO.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.490
SO, REAL HUSBAND,

41:04.420 --> 41:05.630
GO!

41:05.670 --> 41:06.710
OH, YOU GET A HEAD START,
YOU PUSHED ME--

41:26.560 --> 41:27.730
OH.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.610
&lt;KNOCKING&gt;

41:35.530 --> 41:36.740
HMM.

41:48.250 --> 41:49.750
HI.

41:49.800 --> 41:50.960
HI.

41:51.550 --> 41:52.630
CAN WE TALK?

41:52.670 --> 41:55.300
ABSOLUTELY. COME IN.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.350
I WANTED TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

42:01.390 --> 42:03.980
NO, NO. I KNOW YOU DO.

42:04.020 --> 42:07.150
PLEASE, ME FIRST, OKAY?

42:07.190 --> 42:09.400

MEAN ANYTHING I SAID.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.480
I GET IT.

42:10.520 --> 42:11.570
NO, YOU DON'T GET IT.

42:11.610 --> 42:13.190
I HAD A BIKER'S GUN
TO MY HEAD.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.280
REALLY?

42:14.320 --> 42:16.610
YES, REALLY.
PLUS, THERE WAS AN AXE.

42:17.950 --> 42:20.740
AH, I SEE.

42:20.780 --> 42:22.280
ANYWAY, FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT.

42:22.330 --> 42:24.750
THE POINT IS, UM, I HAD TO GET
YOU OUT OF HERE VERY QUICKLY

42:24.790 --> 42:25.750
BECAUSE HE WAS
GOING TO KILL YOU.

42:25.790 --> 42:27.630
AND, UM, HAD TO SAY
A LOT OF THINGS,

42:27.670 --> 42:29.750
AND, THE HONEST TRUTH IS
I DIDN'T MEAN ANY OF THEM.

42:29.790 --> 42:30.750
YEAH, BUT MAYBE
YOU WERE RIGHT.

42:30.790 --> 42:31.840
NO, NO. NO.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.590
NO, I'M NEVER
RIGHT ABOUT ANYTHING.

42:37.720 --> 42:40.140
JAKE, WE CAN'T DO THIS.

42:42.640 --> 42:46.770
NO, I GUESS WE CAN'T, EH?

42:46.810 --> 42:48.020
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

42:48.060 --> 42:49.190
WHAT AM I SAYING?

42:50.560 --> 42:52.270
SHE SEEMS NICE.

42:53.150 --> 42:54.400
YEAH.

42:54.440 --> 42:56.950
WELL, THE MAYOR, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE'S NOT THE SPAZ

42:56.990 --> 42:58.450
I THOUGHT HE WAS. YOU KNOW?

43:01.740 --> 43:03.120
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

43:03.160 --> 43:05.250
YEAH, I'M FINE.

43:08.790 --> 43:11.000
THIS IS GONNA HURT.

43:17.630 --> 43:19.050
OW!

43:19.090 --> 43:20.760
KEEP IT UP,
DON'T BE A SULK.

43:32.940 --> 43:34.440
HOLD STILL.
