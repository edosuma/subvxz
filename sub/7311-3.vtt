WEBVTT

00:29.030 --> 00:30.210
Can't keep up?

00:30.240 --> 00:31.606
Ten bucks says I beat you to the car.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.420
Make it 20.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.380
Guess you owe me 20 bucks.

00:50.490 --> 00:53.840
Oh, my God! David!

01:34.670 --> 01:37.086
Looks scrumptious!

01:37.110 --> 01:38.516
They call it Chocoholic's Choice.

01:38.540 --> 01:40.530
Claim it is the ultimate cupcake.

01:43.630 --> 01:45.456
Oh, that smells great.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.606
Don't you dare!

01:48.630 --> 01:50.506
Isn't this the week
you're going gluten-free?

01:50.530 --> 01:52.870
Thank you, Ziva. You shouldn't have.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.840
I owe you for letting
me sleep at your place.

01:58.860 --> 02:00.456
Slumber party.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.690
You two spent the night together?

02:03.650 --> 02:04.806
What's going on here, McGee?

02:04.830 --> 02:06.206
Don't know, don't care.

02:06.230 --> 02:08.539
None of my business, DiNosey.

02:09.419 --> 02:11.716
You are such a control geek.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.206
Freak.

02:13.230 --> 02:14.746
Yes. That, too.

02:14.770 --> 02:18.120
Why do you always need to know
everything that everybody does, Tony?

02:18.150 --> 02:23.056
What he needs to know is that a lieutenant
commander's body was found in Rock Creek Park.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.826
Identified as a female United
States Navy Lieutenant Commander.

02:26.850 --> 02:27.486
Gear up.

02:27.510 --> 02:31.020
Her name is being withheld, pending
notification of her next of kin.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.636
Lieutenant Commander Carrie McLellan,
35. Stationed at the Pentagon.

02:40.660 --> 02:45.656
She worked as a congressional liaison officer
for the Navy Office of Legislative Affairs.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.576
Lives alone in the Cleveland Park area.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.556
Help, DiNizzo.

02:49.580 --> 02:51.936
Single, small-caliber
gunshot to the back.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.306
No exit wound.

02:53.330 --> 02:57.976
However, her death took place elsewhere.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.376
This bloodstain to her back indicates
she bled out on a solid surface.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.250
Time of death?

03:04.320 --> 03:07.236
Well, movement of the body and
immersion in water complicates matters,

03:07.260 --> 03:09.886
but at least 12 hours, no more than 24.

03:09.910 --> 03:13.860
I'll be able to be more accurate
when I get her back on the table.

03:15.260 --> 03:17.540
They were predicting precipitation.

03:17.570 --> 03:19.066
Just what we need.

03:19.090 --> 03:21.660
Got a partial shoeprint here, boss.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.616
Uh, boss?

03:25.640 --> 03:27.866
Work fast. It rains, we lose evidence.

03:27.890 --> 03:29.256
Yeah. Gibbs.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.326
Stayed at Abby's last night, huh?

03:31.350 --> 03:33.646
You guys, uh, sleep in the same room?

03:33.670 --> 03:35.436
It is a one-bedroom apartment.

03:35.460 --> 03:37.986
One bedroom, one bed. One coffin.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.366
You want the truth?

03:39.390 --> 03:43.210
Yeah. I think I can handle the truth.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.516
My building was being fumigated, and
Abby was kind enough to let me stay over.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.896
On the couch. In my pajamas.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.486
Come on, work with me.

03:51.510 --> 03:52.756
- DiNozzo?
- Couldn't you lie just a little bit?

03:52.780 --> 03:55.966
After you're through here,
the victim's apartment.

03:55.990 --> 03:58.140
Right.

04:03.320 --> 04:07.046
We're fighting the weather, and he
wants us to hurry up, and then he leaves.

04:07.070 --> 04:09.540
What is this all about?

04:25.150 --> 04:27.020
Senator?

04:27.640 --> 04:29.460
Gunny.

04:31.030 --> 04:33.160
Hello, Patrick.

04:34.310 --> 04:36.726
- Thanks for coming, Jethro.
- Yeah, sure.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.096
Why here?

04:38.120 --> 04:41.430
Well, it's best we not be
seen together right now.

04:42.670 --> 04:48.040
I saw on the news, a lieutenant commander
was found shot in Rock Creek Park.

04:48.380 --> 04:51.206
NCIS involved?

04:51.230 --> 04:53.640
I just left there.

04:56.870 --> 04:59.440
Was it Carrie McLellan?

05:01.200 --> 05:03.340
Did you know her?

05:10.890 --> 05:13.390
Did you know her?

05:16.800 --> 05:19.110
We were having an affair.

05:28.350 --> 05:31.196
Why'd you think it was Carrie McClellan?

05:31.220 --> 05:35.690
News report said the victim was
a female lieutenant commander.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.716
Carrie lived near the park.

05:38.740 --> 05:41.326
We were supposed to meet last night.

05:41.350 --> 05:43.466
She didn't show, didn't call.

05:43.490 --> 05:45.710
Try to reach her?

05:46.700 --> 05:49.360
Carrie always made the contact.

05:49.400 --> 05:54.220
Nothing unusual about a congressional
liaison calling a senator's office.

05:56.130 --> 05:58.460
Her parents been told?

05:59.770 --> 06:01.880
Not yet.

06:02.660 --> 06:06.040
They'll be devastated.
She was an only child.

06:07.530 --> 06:10.300
I'm an idiot, Gunny.

06:11.490 --> 06:14.226
I've thrown my career away.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.336
Lynn and the kids don't deserve this.

06:17.360 --> 06:21.540
Once the affair is made public,
everyone is gonna think I killed her.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.066
Pat, I can't cover this up.

06:26.090 --> 06:28.886
Don't expect you to, Jethro.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.970
Tell me about the lieutenant commander.

06:32.420 --> 06:35.540
She was an incredible young woman.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.156
Smart. Well-liked.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.796
Ex-boyfriends?

06:40.820 --> 06:43.220
- Not that she mentioned.
- Problems?

06:44.120 --> 06:47.176
She had a run-in with
her commanding officer.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.666
Yeah? She say what it was about?

06:48.690 --> 06:49.926
Not really.

06:49.950 --> 06:53.220
He took exception to a report she wrote.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.546
Media's gonna have a
field day with this.

06:58.570 --> 07:00.126
Couldn't have happened at a worse time.

07:00.150 --> 07:03.366
My energy bill is up for vote next week.

07:03.390 --> 07:06.816
It shouldn't be defeated
because of my indiscretions.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.526
Legislation is far too important.

07:09.550 --> 07:14.220
The economy is a mess, and
fuel costs are leading the way.

07:15.320 --> 07:19.350
This bill is a way of
turning things around.

07:21.560 --> 07:25.790
Could you please keep my name
out of this until after the vote?

07:29.650 --> 07:32.150
I'll see what I can do.

07:41.340 --> 07:43.206
Oh, it is sad.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.690
It was her birthday last week.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.666
Her grandmother sent her this card.

07:46.690 --> 07:48.686
Am I the only one that's starving?

07:48.710 --> 07:50.046
Haven't eaten since lunch.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.940
Well, there's half a
veggie pizza in the fridge.

07:54.860 --> 07:57.226
Tony? What are you doing?

07:57.250 --> 07:59.890
I'm building a profile of the victim.

08:00.590 --> 08:02.016
Not exactly Navy issue.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.486
She was not just a Navy officer.

08:04.510 --> 08:05.946
She was also a woman.

08:05.970 --> 08:08.306
Officer and a gentlewoman.

08:08.330 --> 08:10.436
Richard Gere. Debra Winger.

08:10.460 --> 08:12.856
It's a rare commodity.
Military chick flick.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.666
It appears she had a lover.

08:14.690 --> 08:16.966
"To the woman I love. You
mean everything to me."

08:16.990 --> 08:19.976
And it is signed, "You know who."

08:20.000 --> 08:21.546
Why would he not sign his name?

08:21.570 --> 08:24.026
Well, maybe it's not
a he. Maybe it's a she.

08:24.050 --> 08:26.456
We are dealing with the
military. Don't ask, don't tell.

08:26.480 --> 08:27.876
Looks like a man's handwriting.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.076
- Definitely a man.
- How do you know?

08:30.100 --> 08:32.476
Medicine cabinet. Low-estrogen
birth control pills.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.905
She's on the ninth day of her cycle.

08:33.929 --> 08:38.306
You just love snooping around into
other people's lives, don't you?

08:38.330 --> 08:41.166
Yeah. That's why I became a cop.

08:41.190 --> 08:43.836
Hey, boss. Everything all right?

08:43.860 --> 08:44.510
Yeah.

08:44.540 --> 08:45.686
No signs of a struggle.

08:45.710 --> 08:47.536
Didn't find any traces of blood.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.626
The commander wasn't shot here.

08:48.650 --> 08:50.966
The neighbors describe
the victim as a loner.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.786
No one knew her particularly well.

08:52.810 --> 08:54.726
Still looking her personal effects.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.336
Keys, wallet, cell phone.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.330
Her car's parked in
her space downstairs.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.490
She's got a lover who
won't sign his name.

09:00.520 --> 09:04.420
There's no pictures or evidence
of him in the apartment.

09:04.750 --> 09:08.300
Boss, my gut tells me she was
having an affair with a married man.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.286
Lieutenant Commander McLellan spent more time
on the Hill than she did at the Pentagon,

09:15.310 --> 09:17.646
but that goes with her job.

09:17.670 --> 09:19.676
When's the last time you saw her?

09:19.700 --> 09:22.070
Monday's staff meeting.

09:22.740 --> 09:25.446
She had Top Secret clearance.

09:25.470 --> 09:27.096
Do I have a security problem here?

09:27.120 --> 09:28.686
Oh, I don't know.

09:28.710 --> 09:31.956
What were her responsibilities?

09:31.980 --> 09:35.336
Developing and coordinating relationships
between representatives of the D.O.N.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.876
and members of Congress.

09:37.900 --> 09:41.336
She made a lot of powerful friends.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.190
Carrie was on the fast track.

09:44.630 --> 09:47.026
Ever meet her boyfriend?

09:47.050 --> 09:48.936
Didn't know she had one.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.226
Don't really know anything
about her personal life.

09:51.250 --> 09:55.810
Understand you took exception to a report
Lieutenant Commander McLellan filed.

09:59.610 --> 10:03.666
Technical specs were supposedly leaked
to a defense contractor a couple days

10:03.690 --> 10:04.996
before their official release.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.926
It was no big deal. Never
traced to my command.

10:07.950 --> 10:10.100
McLellan wrote it up. I told her not to.

10:10.970 --> 10:12.970
She could be stubborn.

10:15.420 --> 10:17.990
- That it?
- Yeah, for now.

10:23.510 --> 10:26.486
Gonna need to take a look at her office.

10:26.510 --> 10:30.000
Had it secured. I'll make
arrangements for you to get in.

10:32.850 --> 10:34.376
- That's odd.
- What?

10:34.400 --> 10:38.096
I'm looking at Commander McLellan's
cell phone calls for the past month.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.896
Restaurants, family, nothing unusual.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.686
But there is one number
she called 36 times.

10:42.710 --> 10:43.336
Trace it.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.040
I don't have to. It's
the Capitol switchboard.

10:48.830 --> 10:50.430
Well, that makes sense.

10:50.460 --> 10:53.856
I am sure she has to call senators' and
representatives' offices all the time.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.016
It's part of her job.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.960
That's exactly my point. Wouldn't
she have their direct dial numbers?

10:58.370 --> 10:58.910
How'd it go?

10:58.940 --> 11:00.776
Admiral made an impression on DiNozzo.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.196
I'm gonna check him out.

11:02.220 --> 11:04.560
He was more interested in
covering his ass than the victim.

11:04.590 --> 11:05.626
You got anything, McGee?

11:05.650 --> 11:07.696
I ran a locator search
on McLellan's cell.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.356
Either her phone is turned off or the
battery's died, so I pulled her phone records.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.656
She made numerous calls to the
Capitol, but always to the switchboard.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.230
She didn't want her calls traced.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.426
Accessed her ESR.

11:18.450 --> 11:20.556
She was fourth in her
class at the academy.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.416
Been nothing but uphill since then.

11:22.440 --> 11:25.016
Awards and rapid promotions.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.386
The family has not returned my call yet.

11:27.410 --> 11:29.290
Got a minute?

11:36.340 --> 11:37.646
So, what's up with el jefe?

11:37.670 --> 11:39.796
Yesterday, he leaves the crime
scene with no explanation.

11:39.820 --> 11:42.636
Today, he knew the admiral
had a problem with the victim.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.806
Where'd he get that?

11:43.830 --> 11:45.790
Maybe he's bluffing.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.420
- It was on the nose.
- Whose nose?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
On the money.
Bull's-eye. Right as rain.

11:56.430 --> 11:58.546
You were doing better before
you went back to Israel.

11:58.570 --> 12:00.660
You've reverted.

12:02.850 --> 12:05.800
I found this message on my private line.

12:08.230 --> 12:11.460
You have one saved message.

12:11.740 --> 12:16.350
The gun that killed Lieutenant Commander
McLellan can be found in the drainage ditch,

12:16.380 --> 12:21.540
alongside the two-mile marker, near the
Grant Road entrance to Rock Creek Park.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.926
It's so filthy. I can't see anything.

12:26.950 --> 12:28.026
It is filthy.

12:28.050 --> 12:30.900
Must be some kind of
sewage thing or something.

12:31.830 --> 12:34.166
It's not here. Someone's
messing with us.

12:34.190 --> 12:36.350
McGee!

12:41.780 --> 12:43.740
I see something.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.160
Over here. Look. Look, look, look.

12:48.530 --> 12:53.420
There. See that? Looks like
a sort of shadowy thing.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.736
Here. Your turn.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.330
I am the Jedi Master. You
are the Padawan learner.

13:06.740 --> 13:10.616
No, it's... farther. Farther out!

13:10.640 --> 13:12.086
I can't go farther.

13:12.110 --> 13:14.386
- Farther out!
- I can't.

13:14.410 --> 13:17.810
All right, here. I gotcha. I gotcha.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.716
You got me?

13:19.740 --> 13:21.780
I'm holding you.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.290
Farther out. Here, hold
on. A little further.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.570
What's that? What do you got there?

13:40.930 --> 13:43.850
See, I told you I saw something.

13:48.510 --> 13:51.020
I had nothing to do with that one.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.716
It's a Smith & Wesson 32 kit.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.806
Just like the gat Bogie was
packing in Maltese Falcon.

14:04.830 --> 14:07.216
It's the stuff dreams are made of.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.110
Out of my way.

14:10.470 --> 14:11.910
Any prints on the weapon?

14:11.940 --> 14:14.176
Gibbs, it was underwater
and covered in mud.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.546
McGee found it with his butt.

14:15.570 --> 14:17.306
The serial number remained intact.

14:17.330 --> 14:18.956
I gave it to Ziva.
She's running it down.

14:18.980 --> 14:21.706
So, the test-fired slug is on the left.

14:21.730 --> 14:25.590
And the one that Ducky removed
from our victim is on the right.

14:31.260 --> 14:33.990
- You've got your murder weapon, Gibbs.
- Yeah.

14:34.390 --> 14:37.280
Handed to us on a silver platter.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.990
Near the Grant Road
entrance to Rock Creek Park.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.266
Secure line, restricted number.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.366
Find out who made the call.

14:53.390 --> 14:56.970
Director Vance, I'll need the
password toour voice mail account.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.976
- For your eyes only.
- Yes, sir.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.926
And the messages from my
wife, not for your ears.

15:11.950 --> 15:14.330
- I understand.
- McGee.

15:15.410 --> 15:16.970
Go home. Change.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.070
You think this is a
catch-me-if-you-can?

15:26.360 --> 15:28.820
The killer's taunting us?

15:29.160 --> 15:30.656
Possibility.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.336
The lieutenant commander
had Top Secret clearance.

15:33.360 --> 15:37.260
Worked on the Hill. Had a
lot of high-profile contacts.

15:37.860 --> 15:40.956
I'm going to need to be
kept in the loop on this.

15:40.980 --> 15:43.716
I've been on the case
less than 24 hours.

15:43.740 --> 15:47.190
When I get something
concrete, I will let you know.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.446
Abby... what're you doing?

16:00.470 --> 16:03.546
A boundary's been crossed,
Gibbs. I've been violated.

16:03.570 --> 16:05.466
Nothing is sacred anymore.

16:05.490 --> 16:07.640
Yeah. Tell me.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.210
Someone stole my cupcake.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.776
- Cupcake?
- Yes.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.526
And it wasn't just any cupcake.

16:17.550 --> 16:20.136
It was a Chocoholic's Choice cupcake.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.286
There is a thief amongst us.

16:22.310 --> 16:25.860
I'm gonna find out who, and
they're going to be sorry.

16:26.730 --> 16:31.090
Do you think you could pull yourself away
from this long enough to focus on the murder?

16:31.510 --> 16:34.306
I've been working, Gibbs.

16:34.330 --> 16:37.656
Commander McLellan... she
buys a lot of clothes online.

16:37.680 --> 16:41.570
She downloads classical music, and she
reads her horoscope every day, as do I.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.606
Today it said I was gonna have a
positive encounter with a coworker.

16:44.630 --> 16:45.836
Not gonna happen.

16:45.860 --> 16:47.086
- That all you got?
- No.

16:47.110 --> 16:50.176
Um, I also found fibers
on the victim's clothing.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.436
They're consistent
with automobile carpet.

16:52.460 --> 16:58.156
So, I'm running the fibers through the FBI fiber
database to try to find out the make and...

16:58.180 --> 17:00.340
- model.
- What?

17:01.560 --> 17:03.400
What?

17:04.660 --> 17:07.280
Is that a cupcake crumb?

17:07.630 --> 17:09.780
No.

17:15.010 --> 17:16.800
We'll see.

17:16.829 --> 17:19.630
Thanks, Jer. You are indeed the man.

17:22.550 --> 17:25.910
If Carrie McLellan had a married
lover, I've got a pretty good candidate.

17:26.950 --> 17:29.060
Her C.O., Admiral Graves.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.396
What'd you find out?

17:30.420 --> 17:32.396
He and the wife separated a year ago.

17:32.420 --> 17:34.056
Now they're back together,
trying to make it work.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.846
But my source at the Pentagon
says he's still a player.

17:36.870 --> 17:39.116
Who's your source?

17:39.140 --> 17:41.366
Jerry the barber.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.066
A barber?

17:42.090 --> 17:44.556
Yeah, works in the
Pentagon Athletic Center.

17:44.580 --> 17:47.656
Overhears more gossip than
anyone else in the building.

17:47.680 --> 17:52.606
Barbers, manicurists, shoe-shine
guys... they're invisible.

17:52.630 --> 17:55.966
People talk in front of them
like they're not even there.

17:55.990 --> 17:57.036
Graves is involved.

17:57.060 --> 17:58.786
You accusing an admiral, DiNozzo?

17:58.810 --> 17:59.726
Following my instincts.

17:59.750 --> 18:03.026
Boss, the anonymous call made to
Director Vance came from a burn phone.

18:03.050 --> 18:06.300
Was purchased in cash from a
convenience store in Arlington.

18:06.510 --> 18:07.606
- When?
- More than a year ago.

18:07.630 --> 18:09.816
Surveillance video is
only kept for a month.

18:09.840 --> 18:13.966
Call originated from a cell tower near
Lafayette Park, across from the White House.

18:13.990 --> 18:16.366
Oh, and I, I identified the voice.

18:16.390 --> 18:19.190
- Who?
- Not exactly a "who."

18:22.780 --> 18:27.176
The sly brown fox quickly
jumped over the lazy dog.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.666
It's a text reader from WriteDraft 2007.

18:29.690 --> 18:33.106
The most sophisticated
voice-generating software around.

18:33.130 --> 18:34.946
Are we gonna catch a break on this one?

18:34.970 --> 18:36.576
I got lucky with the gun.

18:36.600 --> 18:40.246
Serial number indicates it
was manufactured in 1949.

18:40.270 --> 18:41.416
Was never registered.

18:41.440 --> 18:44.266
But the firing pin looked
new, so I checked around.

18:44.290 --> 18:49.316
Turns out ten years ago, it was taken to a
master gunsmith for restoration and cleaning.

18:49.340 --> 18:52.246
The owner's name was...

18:52.270 --> 18:54.736
Otis Tripp.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.150
He died in 1999.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.370
No one leaves here till I get back.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.500
Okay. Now I'm officially curious.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.106
We found the murder weapon.

19:19.130 --> 19:21.676
- That's a good thing, right?
- Yeah.

19:21.700 --> 19:26.920
Owned by a Marine who's been dead nine
years... Otis Tripp, your father-in-law.

19:27.230 --> 19:31.420
Smith & Wesson, 32 kit.
Have you ever see it?

19:32.120 --> 19:35.730
Yeah. Otis left it to me.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.296
I don't understand.

19:38.320 --> 19:42.560
It was in my den, locked in the gun
cabinet with the rest of my collection.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.900
Where did you find it?

19:46.450 --> 19:49.170
All right, I see where this is going.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.920
I did not kill that woman.

19:53.510 --> 19:57.626
Jethro, I could never
get anything by you.

19:57.650 --> 20:00.980
You could always see
right through my bull.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.506
I'm telling you the truth.

20:04.530 --> 20:08.180
I did not kill Carrie McLellan.

20:14.330 --> 20:16.636
Somebody's framing me.

20:16.660 --> 20:19.730
It sure looks that way.

20:20.370 --> 20:23.140
Did Carrie get killed because of me?

20:27.340 --> 20:28.666
Yeah, Gibbs.

20:28.690 --> 20:31.426
I need you back at my office now.

20:31.450 --> 20:33.060
What?

20:35.050 --> 20:37.680
I gotta go. I-I love you, too.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.440
Yeah?

20:39.780 --> 20:40.976
When'd the call come in?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.006
About an hour ago.

20:43.030 --> 20:45.870
You have reached the voice mail of...

20:46.780 --> 20:50.350
What's taking so long?
I led you to the gun.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.746
When is an arrest going to be made?

20:52.770 --> 20:56.800
Is Special Agent Gibbs
covering up for an old friend?

20:59.170 --> 21:00.896
If there's something
you've been holding back,

21:00.920 --> 21:04.180
now would be a very good
time for you to tell me.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.796
- Where the hell are you going?
- Director Vance.

21:10.820 --> 21:13.180
Senator Patrick Kiley.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.336
I met Carrie about a
year and a half ago.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.996
She was helping me with two high
school students from my state

21:28.020 --> 21:31.156
who I was sponsoring for
admission to the academy.

21:31.180 --> 21:33.606
I became fascinated.

21:33.630 --> 21:37.370
Her intelligence, wit, beauty.

21:37.700 --> 21:41.010
I kept finding excuses to see her.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.396
Obviously, that was a mistake.

21:44.420 --> 21:47.246
And when you heard she was dead,
you called Special Agent Gibbs.

21:47.270 --> 21:49.246
I knew the investigation
would lead to me.

21:49.270 --> 21:54.136
In Jethro's defense, the first thing he
said was he wouldn't cover anything up.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.900
Senator's being framed.

21:57.110 --> 21:59.430
By whom?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.006
Any enemies?

22:02.030 --> 22:05.766
Oh, I'm a politician, Director Vance.
Enemies come with the territory.

22:05.790 --> 22:08.020
Anyone in particular?

22:08.980 --> 22:11.400
Yeah. Big oil money.

22:13.410 --> 22:15.696
I hate to accuse anyone.
We're talking about murder.

22:15.720 --> 22:17.646
No, Pat.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.096
No, we're talking about you.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.806
We're talking about your
life, murder of a naval officer

22:22.830 --> 22:26.370
who might have been killed because
of her association with you.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.796
My energy bill is going to pass.

22:30.820 --> 22:35.280
If I'm a suspect of a murder,
the legislation is dead.

22:38.980 --> 22:41.560
There's a lobbyist...

22:42.640 --> 22:46.206
Reed Talbot, who's been
trying to dig up dirt on me.

22:46.230 --> 22:48.526
Would he have killed somebody
over a bill not passing?

22:48.550 --> 22:52.666
It could cost the oil companies
tens of billions of dollars.

22:52.690 --> 22:54.106
And the vote's next week.

22:54.130 --> 22:56.340
Tuesday.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.310
Your status as a senator aside, this
investigation will take us where it takes us.

23:04.110 --> 23:09.220
But it's the agency's policy never
to divulge details of an ongoing case.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.620
Thank you.

23:13.470 --> 23:14.206
Hey, guys.

23:14.230 --> 23:17.066
I identified the fibers I found on
the lieutenant commander's clothing.

23:17.090 --> 23:23.040
Charcoal gray from the cargo compartment
of a 2003 to 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.520
Must be hundreds of
those in the metro area.

23:28.870 --> 23:31.790
- What? Why?
- I need a DNA swab.

23:31.970 --> 23:33.186
What's this about?

23:33.210 --> 23:36.090
Someone stole her cupcake.

23:36.370 --> 23:38.306
No. It's an invasion of privacy.

23:38.330 --> 23:41.646
McGee, I will get your
DNA one way or the another.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.740
Do what the woman says.
She sleeps in a coin.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.940
Thanks. You're next.

23:53.410 --> 23:56.026
Can I do that myself? I don't like
people putting things in my mouth.

23:56.050 --> 23:57.246
Thanks.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.546
Abby, you're making too much of this.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.580
I'll buy you another cupcake.

24:01.530 --> 24:04.166
Feeling guilty, Ziva?

24:04.190 --> 24:06.506
I got you the cupcake.

24:06.530 --> 24:09.710
No one is above suspicion.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.130
Is that, uh...

24:15.450 --> 24:16.536
Yes, it is.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.216
Ziva, background on Reed Talbot.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.746
Lobbyist for oil interes.

24:20.770 --> 24:23.456
McGee, Director got another
anonymous phone call.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.350
On it, boss.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.386
Come on, DiNozzo. You're with me.

24:25.410 --> 24:27.710
Need your DNA, Gibbs.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.606
I'll show you to the study.

24:41.630 --> 24:43.196
Senator?

24:43.220 --> 24:44.216
Is everything all right, sir?

24:44.240 --> 24:45.796
You haven't been
answering your cell phone.

24:45.820 --> 24:48.470
I turned if off, Cole.
Everything's fine.

24:48.990 --> 24:51.936
Um, you know you missed
the Press Club Dinner.

24:51.960 --> 24:52.776
I know.

24:52.800 --> 24:57.850
Special Agents Gibbs and DiNozzo, this
is Cole Erickson, my chief of staff.

24:58.940 --> 25:00.826
FBI?

25:00.850 --> 25:03.180
NCIS.

25:06.310 --> 25:08.386
We're here investigating
a stolen weapon.

25:08.410 --> 25:10.026
I'll explain it later, Cole.

25:10.050 --> 25:13.560
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.796
I thought I heard a familiar voice.

25:16.820 --> 25:19.366
I was going to give Patrick
grief for disappearing tonight,

25:19.390 --> 25:22.866
but since he was with
you, I'll forgive him.

25:22.890 --> 25:24.476
Hello, Lynn.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.006
I'm Lynn.

25:26.030 --> 25:27.656
Anthony DiNozzo.

25:27.680 --> 25:31.170
Lynn, I wish it were, but
this isn't a social visit.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.366
Honey, we have to talk.

25:37.390 --> 25:39.426
What's wrong?

25:39.450 --> 25:42.906
Cole, would you take Agents
Gibbs and DiNozzo into the study?

25:42.930 --> 25:45.226
They're here to look at my gun cabinet.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.720
Mm, yes, sir.

25:48.890 --> 25:51.050
Right this way.

25:52.130 --> 25:54.500
Patrick?

25:56.670 --> 25:58.710
Let's go in here.

25:59.180 --> 26:02.650
Look at that. Armed to the teeth.

26:06.990 --> 26:08.766
Desert Storm?

26:08.790 --> 26:10.870
Yeah, our base camp in Doha.

26:11.160 --> 26:15.026
You're that gunnery sergeant
the senator always talks about.

26:15.050 --> 26:16.466
We served together.

26:16.490 --> 26:21.196
Well, the way he tells it, you made
a young, raw lieutenant look good.

26:21.220 --> 26:22.686
It's locked.

26:22.710 --> 26:24.260
Know where the key is?

26:26.470 --> 26:29.490
- I believe the senator keeps it in his top drawer.
- I got it.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.620
Thanks very much. We'll let
you know if we need anything.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.896
Well, some things never change.

26:46.920 --> 26:50.936
Door's unlocked, and you're down
here working on that damn boat.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.950
How you doing, Lynn?

26:53.620 --> 26:56.090
I've had better days.

26:56.850 --> 26:59.996
It is a six to five game,
top of the seventh inning.

27:00.020 --> 27:03.280
And the series is tied
at two games apiece.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.710
Is the bar open?

27:07.950 --> 27:09.046
Sure.

27:09.070 --> 27:12.200
Oh, and a strike on the inside corner...

27:14.130 --> 27:16.806
Thank God the boys are away at school.

27:16.830 --> 27:18.966
I had to get out of the house.

27:18.990 --> 27:21.880
Been driving around for hours.

27:23.590 --> 27:26.796
Realized I needed someone to talk to.

27:26.820 --> 27:31.326
'Cause I promised the bastard I wouldn't tell
anyone about his sleazy affair with the dead girl,

27:31.350 --> 27:34.190
but since you already know.

27:38.760 --> 27:42.740
Go. Talk. You were there for me.

27:44.820 --> 27:50.550
If you can get through Shannon and
Kelly's deaths, I can get through this.

27:51.580 --> 27:53.840
Gonna be tough.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.836
A circus when the
media gets a hold of it.

27:57.860 --> 27:59.126
I'll tell you one thing, Jethro.

27:59.150 --> 28:02.830
I am not going to be the dutiful wife,
standing by his side at the press conference.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.236
He got himself into
this. He can deal with it.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.730
You knew about the affair?

28:09.660 --> 28:11.896
Not at first.

28:11.920 --> 28:15.000
I mean, you suspect, but
you don't want to believe it.

28:15.590 --> 28:18.046
I didn't even know who the woman was.

28:18.070 --> 28:19.796
I knew where they were meeting.

28:19.820 --> 28:22.196
At his chief of staff's apartment.

28:22.220 --> 28:24.486
Cole Erickson?

28:24.510 --> 28:26.946
I didn't like that weasel from day one.

28:26.970 --> 28:29.860
Seems very loyal.

28:31.500 --> 28:35.346
Loyal? He'd do anything Patrick asked.

28:35.370 --> 28:38.230
I think he's in love with my husband.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.660
I've never seen him with a woman.

28:45.590 --> 28:48.346
Patrick. It's the
fifth time he's called.

28:48.370 --> 28:49.666
You can't keep avoiding him.

28:49.690 --> 28:53.650
Well, I'm not feeling very
forgiving at the moment.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.920
That'll come.

29:03.620 --> 29:06.250
You need to go home.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.860
Thanks for listening, Jethro.

29:26.990 --> 29:30.746
You know, as much as I
hate Patrick at this moment,

29:30.770 --> 29:34.786
you and I both know he's a Marine to the
core, and he would never shoot anyone,

29:34.810 --> 29:38.810
let alone a woman, in the back.

29:48.860 --> 29:51.596
- Okay, talk to me, Abs.
- Thanks.

29:51.620 --> 29:55.116
Um, okay, I analyzed all the
prints from the gun cabinet,

29:55.140 --> 29:57.676
and I matched them all to the
elimination prints that Tony took

29:57.700 --> 30:01.170
from Senator Kiley, his wife and
the chief of staff, Cole Erickson.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.590
There's was one right index finger
that didn't belong to anybody.

30:04.630 --> 30:06.646
I ran it through AFIS. Nothing.

30:06.670 --> 30:08.656
Did the senator have a-a housekeeper?

30:08.680 --> 30:10.616
Well, you'd think so.

30:10.640 --> 30:14.110
What's that? That the shoeprint
McGee lifted from the crime scene?

30:14.850 --> 30:20.050
No. Uh, the print that he lifted
was from a metro policeman.

30:22.030 --> 30:23.870
Well, then, what's that?

30:26.350 --> 30:28.730
I'm so close to a bust, Gibbs.

30:28.760 --> 30:32.070
You cannot have my
cupcake and eat it, too.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.800
- You're not serious.
- Dead.

30:38.280 --> 30:41.066
Thurman Atteberry? The night janitor?

30:41.090 --> 30:42.816
Seems like he's...

30:42.840 --> 30:45.470
recently put on a little weight.

30:46.860 --> 30:48.260
Reed Talbot.

30:48.290 --> 30:51.156
Look at the crooked grin on his face.

30:51.180 --> 30:53.230
Well, he's a lobbyist.

30:53.270 --> 30:54.896
Arm-twisting sleazebag.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.566
To quote a Congressional aide
I interviewed this morning,

30:57.590 --> 31:02.150
"Reed Talbot will do anything in his power
to defeat Senator Kiley's energy bill."

31:02.190 --> 31:03.806
I have a feeling about this guy.

31:03.830 --> 31:06.086
Yeah, I had a feeling
about Admiral Graves.

31:06.110 --> 31:07.136
Even I can be wrong.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.406
Abby's got a fingerprint
she can't match.

31:09.430 --> 31:10.926
Talbot's on file?

31:10.950 --> 31:12.306
No. Checked.

31:12.330 --> 31:14.706
He has never been in
the military or arrested.

31:14.730 --> 31:17.996
Hey, are Cole Erickson's
prints on the gun cabinet?

31:18.020 --> 31:18.636
Yeah.

31:18.660 --> 31:21.616
He's moving up my list. He
drives a 2006 Jeep Cherokee.

31:21.640 --> 31:24.086
Don't know what color the interior
is, but I'm gonna find out.

31:24.110 --> 31:27.066
That second anonymous call to the
director was made from the same burn phone.

31:27.090 --> 31:29.180
- The same location?
- No.

31:30.710 --> 31:32.420
I need this.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.260
What for?

31:36.480 --> 31:38.626
The call lasted 26 seconds.

31:38.650 --> 31:40.116
Started on this cell tower.

31:40.140 --> 31:42.396
Halfway through,
transferred to this one.

31:42.420 --> 31:45.450
The caller was in a vehicle,
traveling westbound on Independence.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.790
Probably used a laptop
to generate the voice.

31:54.470 --> 31:57.280
Excuse me, sir. Do you have a minute?

31:57.720 --> 31:58.416
Sure.

31:58.440 --> 32:01.136
I am collecting signatures
for a national referendum.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.006
What's it about?

32:02.030 --> 32:07.340
There is a movement trying to reintroduce the
55-mile-per-hour speed limit to reduce fuel consumption.

32:07.470 --> 32:09.416
We are against it.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.496
Do you know who I am?

32:11.520 --> 32:15.790
A very handsome man who looks
like he keeps himself in shape.

32:16.910 --> 32:19.200
Where do I sign?

32:22.710 --> 32:24.856
Phone number and e-mail?

32:24.880 --> 32:27.040
That's optional...

32:28.460 --> 32:30.316
Reed.

32:30.340 --> 32:35.480
Well, I'll be happy to
give them... uh, to you.

32:35.910 --> 32:38.530
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.920
Here's the number of
Erickson's PDA. Trace it.

32:54.010 --> 32:56.320
- I'm in the middle of something.
- Now!

32:58.240 --> 33:01.406
Cole Erickson's Jeep has
a charcoal gray interior.

33:01.430 --> 33:03.626
Matches the fiber Abby
found on the victim.

33:03.650 --> 33:04.626
Get a look at the vehicle.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.646
Can't find Erickson.
Not answering his phones.

33:06.670 --> 33:09.016
Called the Senator's office, Erickson
never showed for work this morning...

33:09.040 --> 33:11.100
They're looking for him, too.

33:12.100 --> 33:13.216
PDA's on.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.056
Where is it?

33:14.080 --> 33:15.346
Watergate Complex.

33:15.370 --> 33:17.340
Erickson has an apartment there.

33:20.550 --> 33:22.576
- Yeah, we're here. Is it still on?
- Yeah.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.900
Location?

33:24.280 --> 33:26.496
McGee says the PDA's
still on at this location.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.100
Give me a key.

33:30.390 --> 33:32.620
Keep the hallway clear.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.990
Mr. Erickson, NCIS!

33:41.430 --> 33:42.970
Clear.

33:55.590 --> 33:58.570
Boss? It's a suicide note.

34:09.790 --> 34:13.146
The suicide note was written
and printed on this computer.

34:13.170 --> 34:16.096
Erickson's Grand Cherokee is
still in his parking space.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.826
Having it towed to the evidence garage.

34:17.850 --> 34:18.639
Ziva.

34:18.679 --> 34:20.815
Looks like you were
wrong about Reed Talbot.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.646
He's still a crumb bag.

34:22.670 --> 34:23.585
Hey, you got something?

34:23.610 --> 34:27.280
Yes, this area of the
carpet was recently cleaned.

34:27.310 --> 34:28.716
I will get the ALS.

34:28.739 --> 34:31.706
DUCKY: I can give you a
preliminary cause of death.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.186
Asphyxia.

34:33.210 --> 34:35.926
Yes, well, it is rather
obvious, isn't it?

34:35.949 --> 34:39.186
Would you care to
venture the time of death?

34:39.210 --> 34:41.636
Little after 10:00 this morning.

34:41.659 --> 34:43.496
I'm not feeling very needed.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.485
On what do you base your reasoning?

34:45.510 --> 34:48.270
Suicide note was written at 10:02.

34:49.290 --> 34:51.806
Boss. Found this in the desk.

34:51.830 --> 34:55.866
It's the burn phone Erickson used to
make the anonymous calls to the director.

34:55.889 --> 34:58.556
The laptop has WriteDraft Text Reader.

34:58.580 --> 34:59.746
Listen to this.

34:59.770 --> 35:03.546
What's taking so long?
I led you to the gun.

35:03.570 --> 35:06.090
Gibbs? Visitor.

35:13.470 --> 35:15.970
Cole's body is still in there?

35:17.620 --> 35:19.246
Can I see him?

35:19.270 --> 35:21.820
It's a secure crime scene, Pat.

35:22.860 --> 35:25.466
I just can't believe Cole would do this.

35:25.490 --> 35:28.120
When did he learn about your affair?

35:29.210 --> 35:31.420
He knew from the beginning.

35:31.450 --> 35:34.140
He let us use his apartment.

35:34.450 --> 35:37.690
What was his relationship with her?

35:38.020 --> 35:40.536
Didn't really have one that I know of.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.796
He met her a few times.

35:42.820 --> 35:47.860
I had my own key, so he was
usually gone before we got here.

35:48.550 --> 35:53.356
If what you're asking
is, did Cole disapprove?

35:53.380 --> 35:54.816
Yes.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.166
He left a note.

35:57.190 --> 36:00.980
Full confession. Admitted
making the calls to NCIS.

36:03.180 --> 36:05.810
Addressed to you.

36:12.270 --> 36:14.260
Gibbs.

36:18.950 --> 36:21.720
Blood.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.506
Asphyxia confirmed.

36:24.530 --> 36:28.796
And I found a large quantity of
diazepam in his stomach and bloodstream.

36:28.820 --> 36:29.776
A depressant?

36:29.800 --> 36:31.290
Well, it's not unusual.

36:31.320 --> 36:35.070
Suicides often take drugs to relax
so they won't change their mind,

36:35.100 --> 36:38.600
and in his case, pull
the bag off his head.

36:40.470 --> 36:41.856
You got an opinion?

36:41.880 --> 36:43.000
It doesn't feel right.

36:43.030 --> 36:46.246
We were handed the gun and a
suicide confession... it's too easy.

36:46.270 --> 36:50.156
Senator Kiley is holding a
press conference in two hours.

36:50.180 --> 36:52.110
I've been asked to attend.

36:52.140 --> 36:55.566
I would like to be able to
confirm that this case is solved,

36:55.590 --> 36:58.740
but I'm getting the feeling
that you don't think so.

36:59.580 --> 37:02.720
Hell, you can get a lot
done in two hours, Leon.

37:11.510 --> 37:13.246
You looking for me, Tony?

37:13.270 --> 37:15.770
No. I am.

37:16.680 --> 37:18.940
Do you think I'm an idiot?

37:20.320 --> 37:20.880
No.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.206
What, you thought I
wouldn't figure it out?

37:23.230 --> 37:25.360
What is she talking about?

37:25.390 --> 37:26.686
The cupcake.

37:26.710 --> 37:29.816
You stole it from my refrigerator!

37:29.840 --> 37:34.166
I have forensic evidence.
Your big fat fingerprint.

37:34.190 --> 37:36.010
Oh, come on, you think I'm that stupid?

37:36.040 --> 37:38.856
Look, if I was going to
steal your precious cupcake,

37:38.880 --> 37:41.706
I would not leave a fingerprint
on your refrigerator.

37:41.730 --> 37:45.300
You didn't. You used latex gloves.

37:46.020 --> 37:47.676
Brand-new box, McGee.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.630
Only prints... mine and yours.

37:51.830 --> 37:53.866
You said you were going gluten-free.

37:53.890 --> 37:55.336
Where is it, McGee?

37:55.360 --> 37:57.116
I was saving you from yourself, Abby.

37:57.140 --> 38:00.430
Where did you "save it", McGee?

38:02.020 --> 38:05.546
Okay, I ate it. Look, it was
late. I hadn't eaten since lunch.

38:05.570 --> 38:10.520
Th-Th-The machine in the break room
was empty, and it looked so good.

38:11.460 --> 38:12.816
What were you thinking, McGee?

38:12.840 --> 38:15.636
She's a world-class forensic scientist.

38:15.660 --> 38:16.716
Thank you, Tony.

38:16.740 --> 38:19.850
I bought the cupcake for Abby.

38:21.650 --> 38:23.930
So...

38:24.490 --> 38:26.426
how was it?

38:26.450 --> 38:28.576
It was life-changing.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.426
Book him, Danno.

38:29.450 --> 38:31.806
Ah, break it up, we've got work to do.

38:31.830 --> 38:33.990
Gibbs, we have a confession.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.326
The blood on the carpet
was Carrie McLellan's.

38:36.350 --> 38:38.450
She was killed at Erickson's apartment.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.366
And more of her blood was
in the back of his truck.

38:40.390 --> 38:41.876
That's how he moved
the body to the park.

38:41.900 --> 38:44.740
McGee, pull Erickson's phone
company records for his PDA.

38:44.770 --> 38:48.816
Find out if his device was used
during these dates and times.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.050
Got you, boss.

38:59.650 --> 39:01.226
Your two hours are up.

39:01.250 --> 39:02.566
Jethro.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.130
Appreciate your showing up.

39:05.570 --> 39:07.336
It's good to have the
support of an old friend.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.790
I'm not here to support you.

39:11.980 --> 39:14.150
Let's...

39:15.550 --> 39:18.760
I'm here to arrest you, Pat.

39:26.410 --> 39:28.780
This a joke?

39:30.630 --> 39:33.360
I don't think so.

39:33.550 --> 39:36.820
Cole Erickson's
confession didn't pan out.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.580
He wasn't the anonymous caller.

39:41.710 --> 39:45.996
At the time you got the second tip
from the burn phone, Erickson...

39:46.020 --> 39:50.270
he was 50 miles away talking
to his mother on his PDA.

39:52.690 --> 39:55.870
You placed those calls, Pat.

39:58.160 --> 40:01.700
When you were coming to
meet me at the Tidal Basin.

40:02.060 --> 40:02.826
Jethro, I...

40:02.850 --> 40:06.060
No, no, you traded on our friendship.

40:06.090 --> 40:12.300
You did know that the investigation of
Commander McLellan's murder would lead to you.

40:12.660 --> 40:17.180
So you came to me, and you
volunteered the information.

40:20.580 --> 40:23.410
I should have known
I'd never get it by you.

40:29.900 --> 40:32.900
- I shot Carrie.
- No, you didn't.

40:34.830 --> 40:38.006
You said that I'd always
know when you were lying.

40:38.030 --> 40:40.076
Well, you're lying right now.

40:40.100 --> 40:43.870
- No, I... Why would I...
- Don't say any more, Patrick.

40:45.820 --> 40:49.350
Your mistake, Lynn: Coming to me,

40:49.790 --> 40:53.530
saying to me that Pat would
never shoot anybody in the back.

40:54.770 --> 40:57.990
That detail was never released.

40:58.630 --> 41:01.720
You never should have gone to him.

41:03.610 --> 41:06.390
What the hell happened to you two?

41:07.330 --> 41:09.666
I didn't go to Cole's
apartment to kill her.

41:09.690 --> 41:12.306
I took my father's gun to scare her off.

41:12.330 --> 41:15.286
She got defensive and
said terrible things.

41:15.310 --> 41:16.966
I lost it.

41:16.990 --> 41:18.856
I don't even remember
pulling the trigger.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.596
I got there right after it happened.

41:20.620 --> 41:25.240
I wasn't going to let Lynn go to prison
for something that was ultimately my fault,

41:25.270 --> 41:30.500
so when Cole got home, I persuaded
him to help me dispose of the body.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.610
Jethro...

41:33.180 --> 41:35.680
- it was an accident.
- Maybe...

41:36.280 --> 41:40.576
but the murder of Cole Erickson
was cold and was premeditated.

41:40.600 --> 41:41.716
Framed him.

41:41.740 --> 41:45.270
Made it look like suicide
to save yourselves.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.840
You murdered him.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.776
Do we need to leave with handcuffs?

41:56.800 --> 42:00.060
You are all out of favors, Pat.

42:03.890 --> 42:09.616
Earlier today, NCIS agents arrested Senator
Patrick Kiley and his wife, Lynn Tripp Kiley,

42:09.640 --> 42:13.876
for the murders of Lieutenant Commander
Carrie McLellan and Cole Erickson,

42:13.900 --> 42:15.800
the senator's chief of staff.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.770
Welcome to Washington.

42:20.800 --> 42:24.370
Would have appreciated a
heads-up before the arrest.

42:25.530 --> 42:27.770
You covered good.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.840
Trust.

42:41.670 --> 42:43.810
Loyalty.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.580
They're important.

42:55.170 --> 42:58.630
Guess you know all
about that after today.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.640
How do you think we're
gonna do in that department?
