00:00.935 --> 00:02.301
(Juliette)
Lately, my relationship

00:02.370 --> 00:04.103
with Chloe has gotten
pretty tense...

00:04.171 --> 00:05.671
Stop
Don't push me, honey.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.272
Don't put your hands on me.

00:07.341 --> 00:10.843
(Juliette)
...and it's all because
of Alex's ex Cara.

00:10.911 --> 00:13.145
Cara's definitely
his kryptonite.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.514
If I texted Alex right now,

00:15.583 --> 00:17.516
he would come over
if I asked him to.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.717
If you're single
and ready to mingle,

00:18.786 --> 00:20.486
we should definitely
exchange numbers.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.021
(Juliette)
Garrett's so naive,

00:22.089 --> 00:24.256
he actually thinks he has
a shot with her.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.225
You look beautiful.
Thank you.

00:26.293 --> 00:28.794
(Juliette)
Poor guy's still
rebounding from Kelsey,

00:28.863 --> 00:30.896
who's being
her usual hot mess.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.297
How are things with
the whole boyfriend?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.899
He's in Arizona.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.968
(Juliette)
But Kelsey's
commitment issues

00:36.037 --> 00:38.337
are nothing compared
to Madisson's.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.438
So what's the deal
with you guys?

00:39.507 --> 00:41.306
We're both like, single.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.208
If I tried to be
exclusive with you,

00:43.277 --> 00:45.444
I could like,
ruin however we are.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.813
(Juliette)
Ben's a dog and she knows it.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.882
(Alex)
You are being
a brat right now.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.417
(Juliette)
I thought my own relationship

00:51.485 --> 00:53.552
was so much better
than any of theirs...

00:53.621 --> 00:56.889
I do everything for you.
That's not fair.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.290

...but after tonight,

00:58.359 --> 00:59.591
I just don't know.

00:59.660 --> 01:03.128
Why do you want
to do this right now?

01:03.197 --> 01:05.064

really wanted to like,

07:13.267 --> 07:15.066
rebuild our friendship,

07:15.135 --> 07:16.668
and she apologized
about Cara

07:16.737 --> 07:19.371

Yeah, she admitted to me...

07:19.440 --> 07:21.006
...bringing her around
to piss me off.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.442

at least you admit it.
Yeah.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.377

I mean, Juliette and I obviously

07:25.446 --> 07:27.412
aren't like,

07:27.481 --> 07:30.048
But hopefully in Miami,
we can like,

07:30.117 --> 07:32.184
rekindle our friendship
and like, remember why

07:32.252 --> 07:33.752
we were all friends
in the beginning.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.688
Yeah, I'm just sad,
now I have to wait a whole week

07:36.757 --> 07:38.490

07:38.559 --> 07:40.759
So what is going on
with you and Garrett?

07:40.828 --> 07:42.494
We've had two dates.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.162
Have you kissed?
No.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.964

anything yet.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.800
Do you want to?
I mean, eventually.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.669
But not like, right now.

07:50.737 --> 07:53.572
I mean, half the fun
of seeing Garrett

07:53.640 --> 07:55.373
is that he's always
around Alex and Juliette

07:55.442 --> 07:57.809
and I know it
drives her crazy.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.245
I'm kinda glad
I'm not going.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.147
I wanna spend a little
more time with Tawni.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.349
What do you mean?
Yeah, what is...

08:04.418 --> 08:06.651
So we definitely
have a connection.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.753
We spend so much
time together

08:08.822 --> 08:10.288
and we're very similar people.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.957
For sure.
I've always liked Tawni,

08:12.025 --> 08:15.427
so maybe I can inch my way
into something else.

08:15.496 --> 08:19.164
Really? Has she even
ever been with a girl?

08:19.233 --> 08:22.801
No, but that's not something
that I'm not familiar with.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.169

But I didn't invite her,
so I have nothing to do...

(Amanda)
No, I'm just saying,
I don't mind her

19:12.085 --> 19:14.519

Hi, Garrett.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.559
Yo, homie.

19:26.566 --> 19:30.168
Why would you invite
Cara here?

19:30.236 --> 19:33.004
Uh, I'm trying to get
to know her better.

19:33.072 --> 19:36.507
So you should go
know her better in Sarasota.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.046
Where you going,
Juliette?

19:42.115 --> 19:44.081
It's just like,
you should just
use common sense

19:44.150 --> 19:45.283
that it's like,
incredibly rude.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.885
I told him.
I told him.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.421
If you wanna invite
my boyfriend's ex

19:50.490 --> 19:52.657
who's probably still trying
to hook up with him,

19:52.725 --> 19:55.226
don't come on my trip.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.861
You can go,

Coming up...

20:07.507 --> 20:09.073
So you can sit here

you don't think we have
any chemistry together?

20:11.377 --> 20:12.710
Jacob's about
to come in town,

20:12.779 --> 20:14.512
and I want to keep

got around...

20:29.362 --> 20:30.828

...no one's wondering why

20:30.897 --> 20:32.763

our Miami trip

20:32.832 --> 20:34.065
and stay home together.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.333
(Kelsey)
<i> And dismount.</i>

20:35.401 --> 20:36.767
(Juliette)
But everyone is wondering

20:36.836 --> 20:39.904
what Kelsey's boyfriend
would say if he found out.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.006
So how are things?

20:42.075 --> 20:44.175
Kelsey's meeting me here
to talk.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.677
Ahem.
Yikes.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.547
You sound like you're about
to have a fun conversation.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.983
Probably.
It's okay.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.351
Well, you know,
I'm always here

20:53.419 --> 20:55.686
to get you drunk
afterwards.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.954
Or get you drunk now.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.023
Thank you.
Yeah.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.993
Speaking of,
I had a very

21:02.061 --> 21:03.928
interesting night
the other night.

21:03.997 --> 21:07.164
With whom?
With Tawni.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.566
So that's a thing.

21:08.635 --> 21:11.202
Um, I don't know if it's
a thing exactly yet.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.637
Hopefully, we'll see.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.739
I want the dirty deets.
I want all of it.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.875
Juicy details.
Fill me up.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.910
You know me and Tawni,
so you know it gets wild.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.913
Dirty dancing,
and other things

21:22.982 --> 21:25.383
happened after
dirty dancing.

21:25.451 --> 21:29.086
So if I played baseball,
was it a home run, or...

21:29.155 --> 21:31.055
I mean,
a lady never tells.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.958
Enjoy your secrets.
I'll assume what I want.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.994
So you think it's gonna
go somewhere or is it...

21:37.063 --> 21:39.063
I think so.
I hope so.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.165
How is your, uh,
love life?

21:41.234 --> 21:42.600

you're talkin' about.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.210

at a beach with a nice guy

21:57.116 --> 21:59.050
and didn't do anything
inappropriate.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.085

a great time with Kelsey.

Juliette was, like,
literally, like,

34:00.272 --> 34:02.739
letting Cara see
all her emotions,

34:02.808 --> 34:03.807
and then Cara was just
sitting there

34:03.876 --> 34:05.042
so calm and relaxed...
Yeah.

34:05.110 --> 34:06.109
...and, like, smiling,
and I was like,

34:06.178 --> 34:08.645
"Oh, that must
kill Juliette."

34:08.714 --> 34:09.880
Like, that sucks.

34:09.948 --> 34:12.015
It seemed like Cara
was almost

34:12.084 --> 34:14.017
too vindictive and,
like, patronizing,
and I hope I'm wrong.

34:14.086 --> 34:16.319
My hope is that
she really does
like Garrett,

34:16.388 --> 34:19.656
and that's, like,
why she's here.
I would hope so.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.192
So, how are things?
You glad Ben's here?

34:22.261 --> 34:23.360

"What rooms are
you staying in?
