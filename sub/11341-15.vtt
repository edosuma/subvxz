00:08.210 --> 00:09.325
Thank you.

00:09.330 --> 00:10.490
See you soon.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.496
You scared me there.

00:34.210 --> 00:35.529
Can I hitch a ride?

00:36.500 --> 00:39.287
Look, I'm just trying
to get out of the cold, you know?

00:39.290 --> 00:42.168
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.569
Hey.

01:17.580 --> 01:19.821
I'm sorry.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.616
Where did you say you were headed?

01:22.830 --> 01:24.377
Aanhere but here.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.708
Listen, my wife and I are
staying at a motel up the street

01:30.710 --> 01:32.826
and there's a bus stop out front.

01:32.830 --> 01:36.163
But that's about as far as I can take you.

01:36.170 --> 01:37.614
Deal.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.616
Okay. Get in.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.825
My name is Alan, by the way.

01:47.830 --> 01:49.115
Maya.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.286
Where you from?

01:52.290 --> 01:53.700
California.

01:53.710 --> 01:56.417
Oh, you're a long way from home.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.165
How long you been back there?

01:59.170 --> 02:01.661
A couple hours.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.787
-Don't you have anyone you can call?
-No.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.036
It's just me.

02:07.540 --> 02:09.326
Mmm-hmm.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.373
Well, here we are.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.201
It's not much, but...

02:34.210 --> 02:35.279
Hope it helps.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.109
Thank you.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.706
Sure.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.070
Saw the lights pull up.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.206
I was hoping it was you.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.110
I was starting to get worried.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.786
It took a little longer than expected.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.707
Who is this?

02:53.580 --> 02:55.707
Maya. Gave her a lift
from the gas station.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.916
She's gonna catch the bus.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.457
Oh, there's another storm coming.

03:00.460 --> 03:03.031
Who knows how long that'll take?

03:03.040 --> 03:05.110
Oh, you poor thing. You're shivering.

03:05.750 --> 03:06.910
You have to come inside.

03:07.330 --> 03:09.457
We can't let her stay out here.
She'll freeze to death.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.076
How does a nice warm shower sound?

03:12.580 --> 03:14.457
It sounds amazing.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.609
Come with me, sweetheart.

03:15.620 --> 03:16.780
Let me help you with this.

03:16.790 --> 03:18.280
I've got it.

03:26.210 --> 03:29.577
I am crazy about Sam.
I like him, like him, like him,

03:29.580 --> 03:32.322
but I just... I wish he was
more like out-of-the-box,

03:32.330 --> 03:33.991
take charge kind of guy.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.572
Okay, well, what do you mean
by "take charge"?

03:37.580 --> 03:40.242
Okay. Valentine's Day. I planned
everything, from dinner to dessert,

03:40.250 --> 03:41.410
and by dessert, I mean me.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.951
And I texted him to tell him about it
and he wrote back,

03:44.960 --> 03:48.168
"Sounds great." Octopus emoticon.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.161
I'm not quite sure
I know what that means,

03:51.170 --> 03:52.706
but I guess it's kind of sweet.

03:52.710 --> 03:53.916
What's wrong with that?

03:53.920 --> 03:55.740
Not you, too.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.069
Okay, baby girl,

03:57.080 --> 03:58.877
did you tell him about this?

03:58.880 --> 04:00.575
Did I tell him

04:00.580 --> 04:03.117
I wanted him to take charge?

04:03.120 --> 04:04.701
Not really.

04:04.710 --> 04:05.950
Not at all.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.326
Okay.
Let me let you in on a little secret.

04:08.330 --> 04:11.493
Guys, we don't do well
with subtle clues. Okay?

04:11.500 --> 04:13.491
You gotta be direct, straight up.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.616
Just tell him exactly what you want.

04:16.620 --> 04:20.499
I learn something
from you every day.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.377
Okay, what about you? Spill it.

04:22.380 --> 04:24.371
What are you doing
for Valentine's Day?

04:24.380 --> 04:26.416
I was thinking about
a little candlelit dinner at Le Donkle's

04:26.420 --> 04:27.739
overlooking the Potomac.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.991
Oh! That is romantic.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.530
Look at us. _
We're all grown up. We're like

04:32.540 --> 04:34.781
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.

04:34.790 --> 04:36.746
- -And Savannah and Sam.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.411
Oh, can Sam be Jennifer Garner?

04:40.580 --> 04:41.820
JJ.

04:41.830 --> 04:43.570
JJ! You're back.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.820
And ready to get to work.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.070
How you feeling?

04:47.080 --> 04:48.377
I'm fine.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.530
Don't get me wrong,
I love my boys to death,

04:50.540 --> 04:53.031
but I was starting
to get a little stir crazy.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.166
Well, let's do this.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.319
Yes.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.207
Do you want some tea?

05:01.210 --> 05:02.609
Welcome back.

05:02.620 --> 05:05.077
You sure two weeks is enough time?

05:05.080 --> 05:06.707
Oh, I'm fine. And, yes,

05:06.710 --> 05:09.497
Will made sure
I got clearance from two doctors.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.785
Glad you're okay.
We should get started.

05:10.790 --> 05:13.202
Yes, sir. Pittsburgh field office
has reported two murders

05:13.210 --> 05:14.370
in the past 48 hours.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.240
Both of them were strangled,

05:16.250 --> 05:18.741
and stripped down to their underwear
and then dumped off of a highway.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.786
No, not yet.

05:20.790 --> 05:22.075
The guy has a lot of rage.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.789
He's using some kind of ligature,
maybe a strap?

05:26.420 --> 05:27.990
It looks like he's choking
them intermittently,

05:28.000 --> 05:29.956
allowing them to breathe
only when he permits it.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.372
But the ME. report says
neither was sexually assaulted.

05:32.380 --> 05:34.780
That's odd given the fact
that 80% of crimes against women

05:34.790 --> 05:36.200
involve some sort of sexual component.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.036
Well,
it's the choking that gets him off.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.701
Some form of erotic
asphyxiation filtered through

05:40.710 --> 05:42.871
a psychopath's need
for power and control.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.031
Okay, what is this

05:46.040 --> 05:48.281
Strangely, yes.
Which is why I'm checking

05:48.290 --> 05:49.575
with a number of manufacturers

05:49.580 --> 05:51.411
to see where these
were distributed from.

05:51.420 --> 05:53.411
The MO says sexual sadist,

05:53.420 --> 05:55.911
but the curtain reads as remorse.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.285
Sexual sadists don't feel remorse.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.280
Maybe it's his shame?

06:00.290 --> 06:01.666
Or maybe he's impotent.

06:01.670 --> 06:03.206
He doesn't rape because he can't.

06:03.210 --> 06:04.871
And the embarrassment
of not being able to perform

06:04.880 --> 06:06.245
manifests in him
wrapping up his victims.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.110
He doesn't want to look
at them after he kills them.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.169
Which points to either
symbolic or a literal emasculation.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.489
We need to find out.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.536
Wheels up in 30.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.456
Okay, your homework was to dig deep

06:18.460 --> 06:20.451
and rediscover _
what sparks your paSSIon.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.530
-Mmm-hmm.
-How's that been going?

06:22.540 --> 06:25.498
Fine, once he finds the time.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.378
-Oh, here we go.
-I didn't say it was your fault, okay?

06:28.380 --> 06:31.031
I'm just...
This is what I'm talking about.

06:31.830 --> 06:33.707
Look, you two have already
tried separation,

06:33.710 --> 06:35.280
so the next step is divorce.

06:36.420 --> 06:39.708
But since you're here, I'm assuming you
want to save this marriage.

06:39.710 --> 06:41.200
So I'll ask again,

06:41.210 --> 06:43.326
how have the last
couple of nights been?

06:45.290 --> 06:46.496
Fine.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.706
A start.

06:52.250 --> 06:56.243
This is never going to work unless
you start expressing your feelings.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.456
Oh, right, right.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.779
The process.

07:01.710 --> 07:03.871
Okay. For the next couple of days

07:03.880 --> 07:06.110
I'd like to increase your sessions.

07:06.120 --> 07:09.783
The focus should be about getting back
to the basics of being a couple.

07:10.420 --> 07:13.071
I want you guys
to be more spontaneous.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.072
Go out and enjoy a night on the town.

07:17.580 --> 07:20.617
Last night we did something
kind of spur of the moment.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.247
And what was that?

07:22.250 --> 07:24.821
We checked into a motel.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.166
Where's Alan?

07:43.250 --> 07:44.820
Sounds romantic.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.745
There was a spark or two.

07:54.250 --> 07:57.742
It was like our first time all over again.

07:57.750 --> 08:01.072
I get butterflies in my stomach
just thinking about it.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.370
Mmm, mmm.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.110
Now we're finally getting somewhere.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.031
You gotta trust the process.

08:18.170 --> 08:19.660
Let's build on this.

08:19.670 --> 08:21.661
Any plans of doing it again?

08:23.210 --> 08:25.030
-Definitely.
-Absolutely.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.036
Author Jennifer Smith wrote,

09:01.040 --> 09:04.077
"Marriage is a mosaic
you build with your spouse,

09:04.080 --> 09:08.039
"millions of tiny moments
that create your love story."

09:08.880 --> 09:11.201
This guy's definitely mobile.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.531
We might be looking
at a long-distance trucker.

09:13.540 --> 09:15.076
Garcia already checked into it.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.958
She didn't find any major routes
in or around the dump site.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.370
Speaking of dump sites,
our most recent victim

09:19.380 --> 09:21.746
was found 50 miles from
where she was last seen.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.877
Looks like security cameras
picked her up at a gas station

09:23.880 --> 09:25.324
but never saw who she left with.

09:25.670 --> 09:27.456
Maybe that's where he found her.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.075
It's the perfect hunting ground.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.320
It fits the witness' statements.

09:30.330 --> 09:32.070
According to the cashier,
the victim had been there

09:32.080 --> 09:34.241
for several hours asking
customers for a ride.

09:34.250 --> 09:36.241
Well, she lived locally.
She could have made it home in time.

09:36.250 --> 09:37.410
Instead, she waited.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.320
She must have been
headed some distance.

09:39.330 --> 09:41.537
She could be from anywhere.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.872
Maybe that's why the UnSub chose her.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.075
He doesn't just pick
victims of opportunity.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.071
He targets women who won't be missed.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.991
Good news,
crime-fighters. I tracked

09:50.000 --> 09:52.821
the shower curtains this creep
has been using to burrito his victims.

09:52.830 --> 09:55.663
Turns out they're commercial grade,
sold in bulk

09:55.670 --> 09:58.321
to a bunch of economy motels,
a list of which I just sent you.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.456
It makes sense.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.530
It's a secure secondary location.

10:02.540 --> 10:05.077
Either he doesn't want
to draw attention to his home

10:05.080 --> 10:06.536
or someone is living with him.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.076
Rossi, you and Morgan, go to the ME.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.412
JJ and Reid,
go through Garcia's list of motels.

10:11.420 --> 10:15.072
Blake and I will go to the field office
and cover victimology with Agent West.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.288
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA

10:23.290 --> 10:25.952
Local police are canvassing
rest stops and gas stations

10:25.960 --> 10:28.201
urging female hitchhikers
to be on high alert.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.075
It won't completely deter the UnSub,

10:30.080 --> 10:33.459
but hopefully it will limit
his available victim pool.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.166
_ Where are we _
on Identifying the Victims?

10:35.170 --> 10:37.161
Nothing yet. You guys can work in here.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.489
Thanks.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.377
We should see if there are
any unsolved murders

10:40.380 --> 10:41.950
that match this UnSub's MO.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.370
The transient nature of the victimology

10:43.380 --> 10:45.166
suggests there may be
bodies we haven't discovered yet.

10:45.170 --> 10:46.319
I'll have my guys get right on it.

10:46.330 --> 10:47.820
Thank you.

10:48.620 --> 10:50.326
These women were just
looking for a ride.

10:50.330 --> 10:52.241
They never saw the attack coming.

11:16.290 --> 11:19.168
25 an hour, two-hour minimum.

11:23.920 --> 11:27.378
Hi. Yeah, we'd just like
to ask you a couple questions.

11:27.380 --> 11:30.247
We've been canvassing
several motels in the area.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.241
It's possible a murder's
been committed in one of the rooms.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.911
I haven't seen or heard anything.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.660
Do you mind if we take a peek
at your guest log

11:35.670 --> 11:36.739
or surveillance footage?

11:37.250 --> 11:39.457
We don't have cameras.

11:39.460 --> 11:42.827
We're a cash-only, no-questions
asked type of establishment.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.035
Would you mind taking a look at these?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.707
Do you recognize anyone?

11:51.580 --> 11:52.877
Never seen them before.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.871
This might sound strange,
but are any of your rooms

11:54.880 --> 11:56.324
missing a shower curtain?

11:59.540 --> 12:01.872
I noticed it wasn't there this morning.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.700
The room was totally trashed.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.110
Did a real number on the toilet.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.078
I have someone coming out
to take a look later on today.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.377
Did you try plunging it?

12:11.380 --> 12:12.529
Do I look like a plumber?

12:12.540 --> 12:13.700
You mind if we take a look?

12:13.710 --> 12:15.325
Knock yourself out.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.958
Come on, you gotta put
your back into it, Spence.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.530
Where's Morgan when you need him?

12:28.290 --> 12:29.370
Look at this.

12:35.540 --> 12:36.780
Ugh.

12:37.170 --> 12:38.489
It doesn't make sense.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.411
The UnSub doesn't
have sex with his victims.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.320
Then why did he need the condom?

12:42.330 --> 12:44.286
Well, it takes impotence off the table.

12:44.290 --> 12:45.530
He clearly had
intercourse with someone

12:45.540 --> 12:47.030
after he committed the murder.

12:47.920 --> 12:51.037
So, he doesn't rape her.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.668
He has sex with
someone else in the room.

12:53.670 --> 12:54.739
A lover?

12:55.290 --> 12:57.326
Who's also his partner in crime.

12:57.330 --> 12:59.412
We're looking for a team.

13:02.790 --> 13:04.280
COD's pretty straightforward.

13:04.290 --> 13:07.578
They died of asphyxiation
as a result of ligature strangulation.

13:07.580 --> 13:10.959
Leather fibers in the cuts makes me
think he used some sort of belt.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.530
There's no defensive wounds.

13:13.170 --> 13:14.910
Her larynx was completely crushed.

13:15.790 --> 13:18.611
Hey, Rossi,
take a look at her fingernails.

13:19.580 --> 13:22.663
For a woman who lives on the
streets, she appears well-groomed.

13:22.670 --> 13:24.035
It was the same with both victims.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.032
I'd say they bathed
shortly before the attacks occurred.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.115
Between this and the shower curtain,

13:34.120 --> 13:35.747
cleanliness is important to them.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.610
That could be part of their ruse.

13:39.620 --> 13:42.532
They promise shelter
and a warm shower.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.871
Which would be a perfect opportunity

13:44.880 --> 13:47.576
to carry out a sexual assault,
but they don't.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.662
Instead, they allow their
victims to get partially dressed

13:49.670 --> 13:51.410
in their underwear before they kill them.

13:51.420 --> 13:52.489
Why?

13:53.670 --> 13:56.036
Because it's not about sex
with the victims.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.780
It's about sex with each other.

13:58.790 --> 14:00.951
But if we're dealing
with two men who are sadists,

14:00.960 --> 14:02.951
they would leave the woman
naked to humiliate her.

14:04.670 --> 14:07.036
A female partner might not.

14:08.790 --> 14:10.610
So then we're looking
at a male and a female

14:10.620 --> 14:13.168
who are most likely
in some sort of romantic relationship.

14:13.710 --> 14:16.281
And they're using murder
as their foreplay.

14:24.420 --> 14:26.160
You married?

14:26.170 --> 14:27.990
Actually divorced.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.456
Why?

14:29.460 --> 14:31.826
I just find it amusing
we're paying you for advice

14:31.830 --> 14:33.240
on something you failed.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.957
Well, there's a lesson in everything.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.326
My marriage taught me
patience and understanding,

14:39.330 --> 14:41.378
which I try to pass on to my clients.

14:41.670 --> 14:44.742
Is that what you tell yourself when you
go home to an empty bed at night?

14:48.960 --> 14:50.029
Sorry I'm late.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.450
Hey, sweetie.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.166
Oh, traffic was a nightmare.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.320
No problem.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.570
Here's a question for you.

15:01.580 --> 15:03.286
What's your favorite flower?

15:03.580 --> 15:05.320
Uh, pink roses.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.616
And when was the last time
he bought you some?

15:07.620 --> 15:09.417
Oh, God, it's gotta be years ago.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.160
When did I become the bad guy here?

15:11.170 --> 15:13.377
-Calm down.
-No, she's clearly picking sides.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.916
See, there's that temper again.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.826
I'm actually proposing
that you take charge,

15:17.830 --> 15:19.570
starting with the pink roses.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.667
Think you can handle that?

15:22.710 --> 15:23.745
Mmm-hmm.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.879
For years you've been saying,
"We don't dance enough."

15:44.880 --> 15:45.949
Come on.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.910
Mmm-hmm.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.160
If you were listening,

15:53.170 --> 15:55.456
you'd know I was talking
about the tango,

15:55.460 --> 15:56.609
-not ballroom.
-Just tonight,

15:56.620 --> 15:59.032
for just one night, can we not do this?

16:00.380 --> 16:02.245
Just give it a chance.

16:04.790 --> 16:06.371
I knew you wanted to smile.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.495
Where did you learn how to do that?

16:10.880 --> 16:12.416
I'm gonna show you.

16:12.420 --> 16:13.876
I am a natural.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.780
Oh, I love that cologne on you.

16:15.790 --> 16:19.419
-Mmm.
-Why can't it always be like this?

16:21.250 --> 16:23.377
I'm starting to realize

16:23.380 --> 16:26.326
that change doesn't
have to be a bad thing.

16:26.330 --> 16:27.410
Are you serious?

16:28.790 --> 16:29.950
I'm listening.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.246
I'm tired of following your script.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.707
I want to take the lead tonight.

16:34.710 --> 16:36.666
I'll pick a good one.

16:36.670 --> 16:37.819
All right.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.990
Were you serious?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.570
Sweetie,

16:40.580 --> 16:43.617
tonight, it's all about you.

16:43.620 --> 16:44.666
Oh.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.536
Take a look at this.

17:08.210 --> 17:09.495
You guys were right.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.162
I was able to match their M0
to 10 other strangulation murders.

17:12.170 --> 17:14.320
We were only able to identify four.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.076
They've been at it since 1994.

17:17.080 --> 17:18.957
Looks like they stopped in 2010

17:18.960 --> 17:20.746
and remained dormant up until now.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.786
Something had to prevent them
from killing.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.326
Maybe one was incarcerated.

17:24.330 --> 17:26.161
I'll start pulling prison records,

17:26.170 --> 17:27.990
see if I can't get a match.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.661
These two have been in a relationship

17:29.670 --> 17:31.160
a lot longer than we thought.

17:31.170 --> 17:33.035
But even if they broke up,
to come back together

17:33.040 --> 17:35.782
and resume killing after
a four-year hiatus is rare.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.247
Love is strange.
It'll make you do the craziest things.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.280
Guys,

17:42.290 --> 17:43.917
what if they're married?

17:47.540 --> 17:49.451
Let me help you with your coat.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.076
Your wife mentioned you two were
looking to have a good time tonight.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.378
Ah, she did, did she?

17:54.790 --> 17:56.109
Isn't he perfect, honey?

17:56.120 --> 17:58.418
Hmm, sweetheart, like I said,

17:58.420 --> 18:00.411
tonight's all about you.

18:00.420 --> 18:01.910
Well, before we get started,

18:01.920 --> 18:03.114
you might want to clean up.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.667
Yeah, sure.

18:25.830 --> 18:27.115
Where's your husband?

18:27.120 --> 18:29.281
He stepped out for a sec.

18:31.170 --> 18:33.786
I hope he doesn't mind us
getting started without him.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.916
Actually, I do mind.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.575
Mmm.

19:11.460 --> 19:13.416
I told you I'd pick a good one.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.660
Mmm.

19:28.670 --> 19:29.819
Huh.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.377
This is a first for them.

19:31.380 --> 19:34.076
Aside from gender, the MO is the same.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.071
Something in their dynamic
must have changed.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.116
A male victim most likely caters

19:38.120 --> 19:40.031
to the female UnSub's desires.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.530
They haven't displayed
that behavior before.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.747
Up until now, it appears
it's been the male picking the victims.

19:44.540 --> 19:47.452
Which typically indicates
a dominant/submissive relationship.

19:47.460 --> 19:50.031
It looks as though
her psychopathology could be evolving.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.321
Okay, we need to look at this
from a marriage perspective.

19:54.330 --> 19:57.458
Compromise is the key
to any long-term relationship's success.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.452
What if this murder
was their way of sharing responsibility?

20:00.920 --> 20:03.571
He let the woman choose the victim.
That could be problematic.

20:03.580 --> 20:04.990
Now that she's been given control,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.116
she might not want to let it go.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.320
Dancing.

20:11.620 --> 20:13.997
I'm impressed.

20:14.290 --> 20:16.952
How did all that romance
make you feel?

20:16.960 --> 20:18.575
Spoiled.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.741
The roses, the dancing.

20:21.210 --> 20:24.577
He gave up a lot
to make last night very special.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.282
Yeah, I guess I'm starting to realize

20:30.290 --> 20:32.667
that it can't always be about me.

20:32.670 --> 20:34.706
Compromise is important.

20:34.710 --> 20:37.201
I'm glad you're starting
to understand that.

20:37.210 --> 20:39.917
I gotta say, you both
are making great progress.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.741
I think I speak for both of us

20:42.750 --> 20:44.957
when I say we'd love to make this part

20:44.960 --> 20:47.451
of our regular routine again.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.666
We believe we're looking
for a married couple,

20:53.670 --> 20:56.821
to whom we can attribute
at least 13 deaths since 1994.

20:57.710 --> 21:00.497
He's a sexual sadist,
and she's a scopophiliac,

21:00.500 --> 21:02.320
which is Greek for "love of looking,"

21:02.330 --> 21:04.912
meaning that she gets off
on watching her husband kill.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.820
Like Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo,

21:06.830 --> 21:09.116
who raped, tortured
and killed at least 19 people,

21:09.120 --> 21:12.248
this couple's homicidal tendencies
most likely surfaced once they met.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.413
It's possible that the use
of a shower curtain is a sign of remorse

21:15.420 --> 21:17.285
on the part of the female UnSub.

21:23.380 --> 21:25.575
Up until now,
all the victims were females,

21:25.580 --> 21:27.662
so it's possible that
the change in victimology

21:27.670 --> 21:29.706
could be the husband's way
of subjugating his own needs

21:29.710 --> 21:31.075
for his wife's happiness.

21:31.080 --> 21:34.038
But a sexual sad_ist
doesn't typically subjugate.

21:34.330 --> 21:36.457
We think he could have
committed crimes on the side

21:36.460 --> 21:37.870
that have gotten him arrested.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.416
But wouldn't we have
the bodies to prove that?

21:39.420 --> 21:41.570
Yes. Which is why we need
to take another look

21:41.580 --> 21:44.572
at all strangulations within
the geographical profile

21:44.580 --> 21:46.116
that occurred during the gap years.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.872
Without his female partner's influence,

21:47.880 --> 21:49.996
the male's independent MO
should present differently.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.377
Learning the nature of how that
differs from their team dynamic

21:52.380 --> 21:54.746
will be the key to driving a wedge
between their partnership.

21:54.750 --> 21:57.457
And in the meantime,
all transients are at risk.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.418
Now that the wife has
gotten a taste of control,

22:00.420 --> 22:01.990
she'll crave that feeling again.

22:03.750 --> 22:04.910
Yeah!

22:04.920 --> 22:07.161
And if the husband
sublimated his needs with the last kill,

22:07.540 --> 22:09.917
his desire to fulfill his own
will be what's driving him now.

22:10.460 --> 22:11.916
Thank you very much.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.707
Sweetheart! I'm home.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.660
You're late.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.496
Ah, I had a few errands to run.

22:22.830 --> 22:25.913
-Took a little longer than expected.
-You couldn't bother to call?

22:25.920 --> 22:28.377
No, I couldn't, because

22:28.380 --> 22:30.450
it would have ruined the surprise.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.166
All that overtime,

22:40.540 --> 22:42.496
it finally paid off.

22:44.540 --> 22:46.030
Okay, turn around.

22:48.670 --> 22:50.376
The minute I saw it,

22:50.380 --> 22:51.995
I knew you had to have it.

22:53.670 --> 22:54.819
You like it?

22:54.830 --> 22:56.206
-Mmm-hmm.
-Good.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.740
Well, that's what I was thinking, Paul.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.617
It was 2010 the last time
this happened.

23:04.620 --> 23:06.918
Boy, he just came out
of nowhere this time.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.410
-I mean, he was way behind,-

23:08.420 --> 23:10.661
and somehow he was able
to pull it right off.

23:10.670 --> 23:12.285
He's the guy that can do this...

23:14.330 --> 23:15.706
Well, honey, I got a job.

23:16.330 --> 23:19.163
But we're supposed to be
going to the movies.

23:19.170 --> 23:20.706
The movie starts in an hour.

23:20.710 --> 23:22.280
I'll be back in 30 minutes.

23:22.290 --> 23:24.997
Please be on time.
I don't want to miss the previews.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.163
Sweetie, we won't. I promise.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.205
Okay.

23:31.290 --> 23:35.329
I have a 1989 strangulation victim

23:35.330 --> 23:38.242
dumped 10 miles from where
the first body was found,

23:38.250 --> 23:40.491
only she was raped and stabbed.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.326
It's his comfort zone.
Could be our UnSub.

23:43.330 --> 23:45.571
Well, I've got two more, '01 and '03,

23:45.580 --> 23:48.378
except these took place
in Clifford, Delaware.

23:48.380 --> 23:50.075
The MO's an exact match.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.243
I got another one here from 2013,
Scottsdale, Maryland.

23:53.670 --> 23:55.661
He was smart enough
to cross state lines.

23:56.170 --> 23:58.821
The Crestview rapist was
operating during that time.

23:59.170 --> 24:01.786
The male UnSub never went dormant.
Only the female did.

24:02.380 --> 24:04.450
So when this guy kills without his wife,

24:04.460 --> 24:07.952
his signature changes
to stabbing and sexual assault.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.872
Well, stabbing is indicative of rage,
and it's most likely towards women.

24:10.880 --> 24:14.327
And the sexual assault is his way
of establishing dominance over them.

24:14.330 --> 24:17.288
Maybe their marriage
isn't as solid as we think.

24:17.290 --> 24:20.077
Clearly he has issues
that he's working out

24:20.080 --> 24:21.661
when the wife isn't around.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.321
Well, if she emasculates
her husband at home,

24:24.330 --> 24:25.957
that could be the reason
why she now needs

24:25.960 --> 24:27.416
to have control over the murders.

24:27.420 --> 24:28.910
Hey, guys, we have a survivor.

24:29.750 --> 24:32.207
Hannah Franklin,
a 23-year-old waitress

24:32.210 --> 24:35.998
who was attacked on her way
home from work back in 2008.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.617
How long is this gonna take?
I'm already late for work.

24:41.620 --> 24:43.531
I know this is something
you'd like to forget.

24:43.540 --> 24:45.371
You're damn right.

24:45.380 --> 24:46.665
I still have nightmares.

24:47.210 --> 24:48.700
That guy left me for dead.

24:48.710 --> 24:50.280
Why would I want to relive that night?

24:50.580 --> 24:53.492
Because if you do,
you can stop that night

24:53.500 --> 24:54.660
from happening to someone else.

24:56.170 --> 24:57.410
It's not my problem.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.910
Okay.

24:59.580 --> 25:01.821
Unless that next victim's your daughter.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.611
Because it will be _
someone's daughter, I promise you.

25:18.460 --> 25:20.416
It was dark.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.377
I was on my way home from work.

25:23.380 --> 25:26.918
And I had just cut through a parking lot.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.990
It's okay. Take your time.

25:30.830 --> 25:33.378
I was looking down at my phone.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.281
And that's when
he pulled me into the alley.

25:39.420 --> 25:40.910
Okay, look at me.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.530
Look at me.

25:46.120 --> 25:49.078
I need you to tell me
what the alley smelled like.

25:49.790 --> 25:52.372
I don't know.
All I can smell is his cologne.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.325
Okay, then focus on that

25:54.330 --> 25:56.070
and let it guide you to the periphery.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.206
Oh, no.

25:57.210 --> 25:59.110
What do you see in the alley?

25:59.120 --> 26:00.371
Uh, there's a dumpster.

26:00.380 --> 26:01.870
Okay, keep going. Keep going.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.246
No, I can't. He's on top of me.

26:04.250 --> 26:06.491
Hannah, you're in a safe place. Okay?

26:06.500 --> 26:08.036
I'm right here with you.

26:09.290 --> 26:10.530
What else do you see?

26:10.540 --> 26:11.609
Uh.

26:15.580 --> 26:17.707
There's a couple
on the other side of the fence.

26:17.710 --> 26:18.995
They're getting into their car.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.571
I'm trying to scream for help,
but his hand is covering...

26:21.580 --> 26:23.878
-Can you make out the type of car?
-No.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.950
-Why not?
-There's something in the way.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.029
What?

26:27.750 --> 26:30.321
The hook.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.530
A hook

26:32.540 --> 26:34.110
A fishing hook

26:34.120 --> 26:37.499
No, it's larger than that.
It's attached to something big.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.615
Like a vehicle?

26:39.540 --> 26:42.998
There's a large metal arm.
It's a... Wait, it's a tow truck.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.160
Okay, great.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.035
Can you make out
any identifying marks?

26:46.040 --> 26:48.201
Color

26:48.210 --> 26:50.997
Uh, it's tan, maybe white. I'm not sure.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.321
-Okay, now focus on him.
-No...

26:53.330 --> 26:54.456
What is he wearing?

26:54.880 --> 26:57.371
Some sort of work uniform.

26:57.380 --> 26:58.529
It's greasy.

26:58.540 --> 27:01.111
Okay, now, Hannah,
Hannah, this is important.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.036
Does he have on a name patch?

27:04.040 --> 27:05.496
Oh, God, it's about to happen!

27:05.500 --> 27:07.536
The patch. Look at the patch, okay?

27:07.540 --> 27:09.781
No! No!

27:12.000 --> 27:13.069
Alan.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.206
His name was Alan.

27:18.580 --> 27:19.660
Okay.

27:21.290 --> 27:22.370
Thank you.

27:24.460 --> 27:26.667
It's Alan.
Leave a message. Thanks.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.417
Hi, it's me again. Where are you?

27:29.420 --> 27:31.285
I've left you three messages.

27:31.290 --> 27:33.667
Okay, I'm heading out the door. Bye.

27:33.670 --> 27:35.740
Judith Anderson! FBI!

27:37.170 --> 27:38.535
Show us your hands!

27:40.120 --> 27:41.280
Drop it!

27:41.290 --> 27:43.667
Tell me what's going on.
Somebody, please.

27:43.670 --> 27:44.989
What's happening?

27:45.960 --> 27:47.825
You have the right to remain silent.

27:47.830 --> 27:50.708
Anything you say can and will
be held against you in a court of law.

27:50.710 --> 27:51.950
You have the right to an attorney.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.245
She hasn't even said a word.

27:57.250 --> 27:59.206
Hasn't even asked
where her husband is.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.450
Because she knows the answer.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.490
She's hiding something.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.245
DNA results.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.241
The condom found in the hotel room.

28:07.710 --> 28:09.701
You're gonna want to take a look at that.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.075
Hi, Judith. My name's Alex.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.160
Can I get you anything to drink?

28:33.580 --> 28:35.036
I'd like to make a phone call.

28:37.580 --> 28:38.660
To who?

28:38.960 --> 28:40.029
Your husband?

28:41.500 --> 28:43.741
You're coming up
on your 20th anniversary.

28:44.420 --> 28:47.537
Congratulations.
That is a huge accomplishment.

28:49.580 --> 28:52.993
We recovered a used condom
with Alan's DNA in it.

28:53.460 --> 28:57.169
Nothing odd about that,
except you've had a hysterectomy.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.667
So, why use condoms
if you can't conceive?

29:03.210 --> 29:04.950
You seem to know a lot.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.200
You tell me.

29:06.210 --> 29:09.077
Well, you just don't strike me
as the unfaithful type.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.457
I mean, Alan, on the other hand,
he's a different story.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.030
You know nothing about my husband.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.610
Well, actually, I know a lot.

29:15.670 --> 29:18.036
I know your husband tested positive

29:18.040 --> 29:20.247
for an STD back in 2010.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.611
You two were married in 1994,

29:23.620 --> 29:27.249
which tells me he isn't as committed
to your marriage as you think.

29:29.620 --> 29:31.281
There was a point in time
when both of us

29:31.290 --> 29:32.871
were unfaithful in our marriage.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.745
When I found out he had cheated...

29:35.750 --> 29:38.571
You thought if you retaliated
it would make you feel better.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.667
My husband and I
no longer keep secrets.

29:42.670 --> 29:45.377
I've known he's had an STD for years.

29:46.210 --> 29:48.872
The reason we use condoms,
to answer your question,

29:48.880 --> 29:50.871
is because he insists on protecting me.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.110
That's how much he loves me.

29:55.580 --> 29:57.787
So she's aware of Alan's indiscretions.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.536
He contracted the STD in 2010.

30:00.830 --> 30:02.536
That's around the same time
they went dormant.

30:02.540 --> 30:04.701
The first body was found in 1989.

30:04.710 --> 30:06.996
But Judith and Alan
weren't married until '94.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.456
Which means Alan
was doing this on his own

30:08.460 --> 30:09.870
five years before they met.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.450
And once they were married,
there was no conflict

30:11.460 --> 30:12.745
until he cheated on her.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.661
That's probably when
Judith decided she no longer

30:14.670 --> 30:16.456
wanted to participate in the murders.

30:16.460 --> 30:18.667
She took away
what he enjoyed doing most.

30:18.670 --> 30:21.616
So she's probably not aware
that he continued to kill without her.

30:38.290 --> 30:40.281
Hi, it's me again.
Where are you?

30:40.290 --> 30:42.076
I've left you three messages.

30:42.380 --> 30:44.746
Okay, I'm heading out the door. Bye.

30:44.750 --> 30:46.991
Judith Anderson! FBI!

30:47.000 --> 30:48.206
Show us your hands!

30:48.210 --> 30:49.325
Drop it!

30:49.330 --> 30:51.537
Tell me what's going on.
Somebody, please.

30:51.540 --> 30:52.780
What's happening?

30:53.790 --> 30:55.872
You have the right to remain silent.

30:55.880 --> 30:58.997
Anything you say can and will
be held against you in a court of law.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.702
I can't wait to see where this is headed.

31:06.330 --> 31:09.037
When you discovered
your husband was cheating,

31:09.040 --> 31:12.498
you took away the one thing
that mattered most to him.

31:14.210 --> 31:15.666
His partner in crime.

31:16.540 --> 31:18.610
Now, how do you think
he dealt with that?

31:20.580 --> 31:22.411
Do you recognize any of these women?

31:22.420 --> 31:24.820
How many times are we
gonna go through this?

31:24.830 --> 31:26.286
No, I do not.

31:26.290 --> 31:28.246
And these are only a few of the victims

31:28.250 --> 31:31.322
that he raped and murdered
without you.

31:33.580 --> 31:36.071
And which one do you think
gave him the STD?

31:36.960 --> 31:38.916
Just take a look for yourself.

31:45.460 --> 31:48.998
His DNA is all over
each of these women.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.577
It's the killing without you
that's most painful.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.878
That's the cheating
that you can't forgive.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.877
You're married. Where's your husband?

32:07.380 --> 32:08.495
At home.

32:08.500 --> 32:10.036
Hmm, and you're here.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.029
Huh.

32:12.040 --> 32:14.326
What would happen
if he were to slip up?

32:17.250 --> 32:18.410
How would you know?

32:19.170 --> 32:20.569
A wife knows.

32:21.380 --> 32:23.917
Which is why you know
I'm telling you the truth.

32:23.920 --> 32:25.785
My husband and I aren't perfect.

32:25.790 --> 32:27.746
Look at these women.
Look at the way he treated them.

32:27.750 --> 32:29.286
We're rebuilding step by step...

32:29.290 --> 32:31.952
-He hates them because he hates you.
-...brick by brick...

32:31.960 --> 32:33.109
He loves me!

32:33.420 --> 32:35.035
I want to talk to a lawyer.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.998
I've gotta hand it to her.
Judith's not budging.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.956
She's committed
to protecting her husband.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.200
And their marriage.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.537
"We're rebuilding step by step"?

32:49.540 --> 32:51.417
Interesting choice of words.

32:51.420 --> 32:54.241
Oh, I've heard those many times before.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.450
Marriage counseling.

32:58.330 --> 33:02.323
That would explain how they were able
to move through Alan's infidelity.

33:02.330 --> 33:03.820
They were seeing a therapist.

33:03.830 --> 33:05.115
Maybe they still are.

33:07.290 --> 33:08.575
Green means go.

33:08.580 --> 33:11.822
Garcia, can you check and see
if Judith and Alan have a therapist?

33:11.830 --> 33:13.206
Checking now.

33:13.210 --> 33:15.110
Uh, okay. Looks like they sought help

33:15.120 --> 33:16.610
from a bunch of different people,

33:16.620 --> 33:18.167
but for the past
couple of months, anyway,

33:18.170 --> 33:20.536
they've been seeing
a Kathleen Benedict

33:20.540 --> 33:22.701
several times a week.
Says here she speCIalizes

33:22.710 --> 33:24.996
in something called insight therapy.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.491
Insight therapy is also known
as psychodynamic therapy.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.377
It helps patients rediscover
what motivates them

33:29.380 --> 33:31.200
in an effort to resolve old conflicts.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.371
But if the conflict
stems from their marriage,

33:33.380 --> 33:35.610
then helping Judith and Alan
rediscover what motivates them

33:35.620 --> 33:37.702
would reignite their compulsion to kill.

33:37.710 --> 33:40.281
Therapy was most likely Judith's idea.

33:40.290 --> 33:43.453
Alan doesn't seem like the type
to take guidance from a woman.

33:43.460 --> 33:45.781
Maybe the emasculation
we profiled didn't come from Judith.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.280
Maybe it came from the therapist.

33:51.080 --> 33:54.163
Dr Benedict! Dr Benedict!
Oh,

33:54.170 --> 33:55.956
Listen, sorry to call you
at the last minute.

33:55.960 --> 33:58.326
No, it's fine. Uh, what's going on?

33:58.330 --> 33:59.740
Your message sounded urgent.

33:59.750 --> 34:02.241
Oh, well, Judith and I,
we might be going away for a while,

34:02.250 --> 34:04.457
so I just wanted to have
one more session,

34:04.750 --> 34:06.411
get a few things off my chest.

34:07.250 --> 34:08.456
I'm impressed.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.990
I know how hard
therapy has been for you.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.911
This is definitely
a step in the right direction.

34:12.920 --> 34:13.955
Yeah.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.070
You do something
different with your hair?

34:17.080 --> 34:18.206
No.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.319
It looks nice.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.161
Here, let me get that for you.

34:26.460 --> 34:28.075
Is Judith here yet?

34:28.080 --> 34:29.911
Uh, no. She's not coming.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.069
Just you and me.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.747
That was Hotch.
No sign of Alan at the house.

34:43.750 --> 34:45.206
He's probably aware
that we have Judith in custody.

34:45.210 --> 34:48.111
If that's the case, he knows it's only
a matter of time before we get to him.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.576
At this point,
the guy's got nothing to lose,

34:49.580 --> 34:51.491
which makes him
more dangerous than ever.

34:53.580 --> 34:56.117
Huh, so where is everyone?

34:56.120 --> 34:58.247
They all took off for the long weekend.

34:58.250 --> 34:59.990
You didn't have any plans?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.412
Figured I'd use this time
to catch up on work.

35:02.420 --> 35:04.911
Well, I guess it's just
me and you, then, huh?

35:09.290 --> 35:11.167
Excuse me. It's my personal line.

35:11.170 --> 35:13.206
-Sure.
-This is Kathleen.

35:13.210 --> 35:15.531
Kathleen, my name is Spencer Reid.
I'm a federal agent.

35:15.540 --> 35:17.496
Right now I need you
to stay calm and not react.

35:18.420 --> 35:19.660
Okay.

35:19.670 --> 35:22.412
Is Alan Anderson there with you?
Answer yes or no.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.705
Yes, that's correct.

35:24.170 --> 35:25.990
You need to understand
that Alan is a dangerous man

35:26.000 --> 35:27.661
and he's wanted for several murders.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.076
Okay. I understand.

35:32.250 --> 35:33.535
How can I help?

35:33.540 --> 35:35.496
Do you think you can get away
from there without alerting him?

35:37.500 --> 35:40.037
Not at this time. I'm completely booked.

35:42.880 --> 35:43.915
Hello?

35:44.210 --> 35:46.246
-Do you think he knows?
-I think you should step on the gas.

35:50.420 --> 35:52.661
That's one thing I've learned
in the 20 years I've been married,

35:52.670 --> 35:55.377
is to listen to how
a woman speaks on the phone.

35:56.170 --> 35:57.535
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:59.710 --> 36:00.870
You nervous?

36:00.880 --> 36:02.609
Alan, you're not being
rational right now.

36:02.620 --> 36:04.110
We can talk about_
whatever's on your mind.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.497
Or I can just show you.

36:08.210 --> 36:09.370
Aah.

36:09.380 --> 36:11.325
No!

36:20.120 --> 36:21.530
Aah!

36:27.210 --> 36:28.325
Somebody...

36:28.330 --> 36:29.376
Uhh.

36:30.500 --> 36:33.071
Somebody, please,
please, somebody, please.

36:34.670 --> 36:35.739
Somebody, please!

36:40.000 --> 36:41.991
You don't know how long
I've been waiting for this!

36:48.500 --> 36:50.115
-Alan, don't do this.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.660
Trust my process.

37:06.750 --> 37:08.411
Alan Anderson, FBI!

37:11.460 --> 37:12.495
Don't!

37:12.880 --> 37:14.996
- -It's okay. Hey, you're okay.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.371
We found Alan.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.995
Where is he

37:31.000 --> 37:33.616
He's fine, and so is Dr Benedict,

37:33.620 --> 37:35.747
who he attempted to rape and kill.

37:38.920 --> 37:42.037
Judith, your husband
is going away for a long time,

37:42.040 --> 37:43.530
but you don't have to.

37:44.500 --> 37:48.573
If you cooperate, I will move
to get your sentence reduced.

37:49.880 --> 37:52.201
This is the last time
I'm gomg to say this.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.661
I will never betray him

37:55.040 --> 37:56.826
or my marriage again.

37:58.170 --> 38:00.161
You might want to reconsider that.

38:01.750 --> 38:05.208
He certainly betrays you
every chance he gets.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.668
This is Gloria Walters,
and the necklace she's wearing

38:10.670 --> 38:12.490
was given to her by her fianc.

38:14.210 --> 38:16.872
She was raped and murdered
last night by your husband,

38:16.880 --> 38:20.202
who we've also identified
as the Crestview rapist.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.035
Can I see him?

38:50.540 --> 38:51.609
Hey.

38:52.210 --> 38:53.609
Sweetheart.

38:54.540 --> 38:55.916
You son of a bitch!

38:57.540 --> 39:00.373
You're a liar. I hate you!

39:00.380 --> 39:01.415
Get him out.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.873
I am so sorry. I totally could have made
that recipe without cilantro.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.825
It's my fault. I should have
disclosed my food allergies.

39:17.830 --> 39:19.070
But I could have asked.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.877
Take a breath.
The swelling's gone down.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.030
Now what are we gonna do
for our first Valentine's?

39:23.580 --> 39:24.877
Whatever you want to do.

39:26.380 --> 39:28.610
I don't want it to always be up to me.

39:28.620 --> 39:30.668
I thought you liked planning things.

39:30.670 --> 39:34.071
Yeah. But if I'm always
the one planning things,

39:34.580 --> 39:36.707
then I'm always
the one planning things.

39:38.380 --> 39:39.415
You're right.

39:39.830 --> 39:41.957
So I'm gonna make
the executive decision

39:41.960 --> 39:45.873
that we are spending
our first Valentine's Day at Patty's.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.741
Patty's, the diner?

39:48.750 --> 39:50.320
Yeah, Patty's the diner.

39:50.830 --> 39:52.741
They have the best milkshakes in town.

39:53.210 --> 39:54.279
Come on.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.240
I like milkshakes.

40:03.250 --> 40:05.320
- -Come here. Come here.

40:05.330 --> 40:07.958
You know, that's why I blame you.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.200
-What, me?
-Yes.

40:09.210 --> 40:10.996
One more time _
turned into two more times,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.878
and now there's no way we're getting
a table on such short notice.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.495
Girl, look at you. Can you blame me?

40:15.920 --> 40:18.741
But as long as I'm with you,
we can go anywhere you want.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.910
Oh, wait a minute.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.535
Hello. What are you doing here?

40:22.540 --> 40:23.700
Oh, my God.

40:23.710 --> 40:24.825
Penelope?

40:25.460 --> 40:27.917
Wow, it is so nice to finally meet you.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.035
You, too.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.576
-Hey, you must be Sam.
-Sam I am.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.199
I've heard a lot about you.

40:32.210 --> 40:34.701
Oh, not guilty. Not guilty.

40:34.710 --> 40:36.575
Look at you guys.
You're literally flawless.

40:36.580 --> 40:38.457
You're like the live-action
Ken and Barbie.

40:38.830 --> 40:40.570
So where are you guys headed?

40:40.580 --> 40:42.161
Uh, well, we actually
had a change of plans.

40:43.170 --> 40:44.489
Same here.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.821
Is what's happening right now
what I think is happening right now?

40:46.830 --> 40:48.161
Why, I believe so.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.781
-This is our first double date.
-In that case, after you.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.166
All right.

40:53.170 --> 40:54.376
And after you, sir.

40:57.420 --> 41:01.163
"Each relationship nurtures
a strength or weakness within you."

41:01.170 --> 41:02.535
Michael Murdock.
