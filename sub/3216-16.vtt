where he left off. Saving people.

00:07.133 --> 00:09.260
Hunting things. The family business.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.513
I don't understand the blind
faith you have in the man.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.599
You're a selfish bastard, you know that?
You just do whatever you want.

00:15.891 --> 00:17.893
Hey, I'm taking off.
I will leave your ass, you hear me?

00:17.977 --> 00:20.020
SAM: That's what I want you to do.
-I'm Meg.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.022
Sam. So where you headed?

00:22.106 --> 00:23.524
No way I'm telling you.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.110
-Why not?
-You could be some kind of freak.

00:29.321 --> 00:32.032
It makes no sense.
Hell, I could've taken them both.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.034
Why let them go?

Hey, Meredith, it's Kristen.

You have to tell me what
happened last night. Call me.

Meredith. It's Derrick. Where you been?

03:20.075 --> 03:23.287
I've been trying to get ahold of you.
I got somebody who wants to meet.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.164
The only way to find out who...

03:25.247 --> 03:28.500
...is by calling me back. If you
wanna solve that mystery, call me.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.169

All right, Dean.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.172
-This is the place.
-I gotta say...

04:15.381 --> 04:18.550
...Dad and me did just fine
without these stupid costumes.

04:18.926 --> 04:22.805
I feel like a high school drama dork.

04:24.098 --> 04:27.559
What was that play that you did?
That-- What was it? Our Town.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.603
Yeah. You were good.
It was cute.

04:29.812 --> 04:31.230
You wanna pull this off, or not?

04:31.480 --> 04:34.108
I'm saying these outfits
cost hard-earned money, okay?

04:34.191 --> 04:37.569
-Whose?
-Ours. You think credit-card fraud's easy?

04:40.656 --> 04:42.574
Thanks for letting us look around.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.953
Well, police said they were
done with the place, so....

04:56.672 --> 04:58.966
You guys said you're
with the alarm company?

04:59.174 --> 05:00.300
That's right.

05:00.384 --> 05:04.847
Well, no offense, but your alarm's
about as useful as boobs on a man.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.390
Well, that's why we're here.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.227

stop it from happening again.

-Now, ma'am, you found the body?
-Yeah.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.775
SAM: Right after it happened.
-No.

05:16.984 --> 05:20.237
Few days later. Meredith's work
called, she hadn't showed up.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.281
WOMAN:
I knocked on her door.

05:22.364 --> 05:25.325
That's when I noticed the smell.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.828
Any windows open?
Any sign of break-in?

05:28.037 --> 05:30.205
No, windows were locked.
Door was bolted.

05:30.456 --> 05:32.458
Chain was on the door.
We had to cut it.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.877
-And the alarm was still on?
-Like I said...

05:35.085 --> 05:37.337
-...bang-up job your company's doing.
-Mm-hm.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.299
You see any overturned furniture?
Broken glass? Struggle?

05:40.549 --> 05:43.635
Everything was in perfect condition.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.680
Except Meredith.

05:47.306 --> 05:51.143
-And what condition was Meredith in?
-Meredith was all over.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.728
In pieces.

WOMAN: The guy who killed her
must have been a wack job.

05:55.814 --> 06:00.402
But, I'll tell you, if I didn't know any
better, I'd have said a wild animal did it.

06:03.947 --> 06:07.451
Ma'am, you mind if we take some time,
give this place a once-over?

06:08.243 --> 06:11.038
Go right ahead. Knock yourself out.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.921
So the killer walks in
and out of the apartment.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.215
-No weapons, no prints.
-I'm telling you...

06:21.298 --> 06:24.843
...the minute I found that article,
I knew this was our kind of gig.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.678
I think I agree with you.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.722
You say you talked to the cops?

06:28.972 --> 06:35.187
Uh, yeah. Spoke to Amy, a charming,
perky officer of the law.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.148
-Yeah? What did you find out?
-Well, she's a Sagittarius.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.443
She loves tequila. I mean....

06:42.111 --> 06:44.363
-Oh, and she's got this tattoo, right--
-Dean.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.366
What? Yeah. Nothing
we don't already know.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.910
Except for one thing they're
keeping out of the papers.

06:50.119 --> 06:53.330
-Hm?
-Meredith's heart was missing.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.960
-Her heart?
-Yeah, her heart.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.545
So, what do you think did it?

06:59.753 --> 07:03.674
The landlady said it looked like
an animal attack. Maybe it was.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.175
-Werewolf?
-Not a werewolf.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.010
The lunar cycle's not right.

07:07.261 --> 07:10.347
Plus, if it was a creature,
it would've left some kind of trace.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.349
It's probably a spirit.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.560
Mm.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.313
See if you can find
any masking tape around.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.547
Ever see that symbol before?

Never.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.865
Thanks.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.088
-Talked to the bartender.
-You get anything?

08:25.339 --> 08:27.507
-Besides her number.
-Dude.

08:27.591 --> 08:31.595
I'm a professional. I'm offended
that you would think that.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.349
All right.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.352
You mind doing a little bit of thinking
with your upstairs brain, Dean?

08:38.435 --> 08:42.356
Huh? There's nothing. Meredith
worked here. She waited tables.

08:42.439 --> 08:45.067
Everyone here is her friend.
They say she's normal.

08:45.275 --> 08:48.111
She didn't do or say anything weird
before she died. So....

08:48.362 --> 08:49.821
What about that symbol? Anything?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.991
Nothing. It wasn't in Dad's journal
or any of the usual books.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.869
So I'll just have to
dig a little deeper, I guess.

08:57.371 --> 09:01.416
-There was a victim before Meredith?
-Right, yeah. His name was....

09:01.625 --> 09:03.627
His name was Ben Swardstrom.

09:05.462 --> 09:08.465
He was mutilated. Same deal, the
door was locked, the alarm was on.

09:08.674 --> 09:12.386
-Is there any connection between them?
-Nothing I can tell. I mean, not yet.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.471
Ben was a banker,
Meredith was a waitress.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.225
They never met, never knew anyone
in common. From different worlds.

09:18.433 --> 09:23.480
So the only successful intel we've scored
so far is the bartender's phone number.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.693
What?

09:30.279 --> 09:31.697
Sam.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.082
-Meg.
-Sam.

09:47.045 --> 09:52.259
Sam, is that you? Oh, my gosh.

09:54.553 --> 09:57.556
-What are you doing here?
-I'm just in town visiting friends.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.478
-Where are they?
-Well, they're not here right now.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.648
But what about you, Meg?
You were going to California.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.569
I did. I came, I saw, I conquered.

10:10.652 --> 10:15.073
Oh, and I met what's-his-name,
something Michael Murray, at a bar.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.617
-Who?
-It doesn't matter.

10:18.035 --> 10:22.247

I'd never see you again.

This is.... This is my brother, Dean.

-This is Dean?
-Yeah.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.236
-So you've heard of me?
-Oh, yeah.

10:53.445 --> 10:57.991
I've heard of you. Nice, the way
you treat your brother like luggage.

-Sorry?
-Let him do what he wants to do.

over God's green earth.

It's just the way you
told me he treats you....

-If it were me, I'd kill him.
-It's all right. He means well.

-We should hook up while you're in town.
-Yeah.

-Show you a hell of a time.
-That's great. Why don't you--

-I don't really know.

I don't know, man, it's weird.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.859
Well, what was she saying?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.153
What, were you bitching about me
to a chick?

12:16.361 --> 12:18.363
I'm sorry. It was
when we had that fight...

12:18.572 --> 12:21.533
...when I was in that bus stop
in Indiana. It's not important.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.161
Any truth to it? Am I keeping
you against your will?

12:24.369 --> 12:26.288
No, of course not.
Now, would you listen?

-Tell me about it.

-She wasn't that into me.
-No, man.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.797
I mean our kind of strange.
Maybe even a lead.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.383
-Why do you say that?
-I met Meg weeks ago...

12:38.592 --> 12:41.887
...on the side of the road. Now I
run into her in some Chicago bar?

12:42.387 --> 12:45.682
The bar where a waitress was
slaughtered by something supernatural.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.976
-Think that's weird?
-Coincidence. It happens.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.729
Well, yeah, it happens. But not to us.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.607
I could be wrong,
but there's something about her...

12:53.815 --> 12:56.985
-...that I can't quite put my finger on.
-I bet you'd like to.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.071
Maybe she's not a suspect.
You got a thing for her, huh?

13:00.363 --> 13:03.533
Maybe you're thinking a little too
much with the upstairs brain. Huh?

Do me a favor. Check
if there's really a Meg Masters...

...from Andover.
See if you can dig anything up...

-...on that symbol on Meredith's floor.
-What are you gonna do?

-I'm gonna watch Meg.
-You are.

-You little pervert.

(PHONE RINGING)

13:46.117 --> 13:49.246
-Hey.
-You're lurking outside her apartment?

13:49.454 --> 13:51.456
No.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.710
-Yes.
-Funny way of showing your affection.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.421
-You find anything on her or what?
-She checks out.

13:58.672 --> 14:02.300
There's a Masters in the phone book.
I pulled up her high school photo.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.636
Why don't you go knock
on her door...

14:04.844 --> 14:09.140
...and invite her to a poetry reading
or whatever it is you do?

14:10.934 --> 14:13.812
-What about the symbol? Any luck?
DEAN (ON PHONE): I did have some luck.

14:13.895 --> 14:17.816
It's.... Turns out it's Zoroastrian.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.902
Very, very old school,
like 2000 years before Christ.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.862
It's a sigil for a Daeva.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.699
-What's a Daeva?
-Translates to "demon of darkness."

14:25.949 --> 14:28.326
Zoroastrian demons.
And they're savage, animalistic.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.830
You know, nasty attitudes.
Kind of like demonic pit bulls.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.873
-How'd you figure that out?
-Give me credit.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.042
-I can chase paper too.
-Oh, yeah?

14:36.293 --> 14:38.878
Name the last book you read.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.007
I called Caleb, he told me, all right?

14:42.257 --> 14:44.050
-Yeah.
-Here's the thing, Daevas...

14:44.259 --> 14:46.052
...they have to be summoned,
conjured.

14:46.261 --> 14:49.222
-So someone's controlling it?
-Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.558
From what I gather,
it's pretty risky too.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.852
They tend to bite
the hand that feeds them.

14:54.311 --> 14:57.439
-And the arms and torsos.
-So, what do they look like?

14:57.647 --> 14:59.941
Nobody's seen them
for a couple of millennia.

15:00.025 --> 15:03.862
Summoning a demon that ancient,
someone really knows their stuff.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.281
I think we got a major player in town.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.117
Why don't you give that girl
a private strip-o-gram.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.869
-Bite me.
-Bite her.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.998
Don't leave teeth marks.
Just enough to where-- Sam? You--

15:41.274 --> 15:42.734
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:44.152 --> 15:47.155
-No, no. I'm-- I'm just--
-Pervert.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.118
(CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

18:44.666 --> 18:46.334
I don't think you should come.

18:47.168 --> 18:51.047
Because the brothers, they're
in town. I didn't know that--

18:56.594 --> 18:58.179
Yes, sir.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.181
MEG:
Yes. I'll be here...

19:01.516 --> 19:02.934
...waiting for you.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.396
What the hell?

20:38.863 --> 20:41.032
(IN UNISON)
Dude, I gotta talk to you.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.534
So hot little Meg is
summoning the Daeva?

20:43.743 --> 20:47.163
Looks like she was using
that black altar to control the thing.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.207
So Sammy's got a thing
for the bad girl?

20:50.375 --> 20:51.751
What's the deal with that bowl?

20:51.960 --> 20:55.838
She talked into it, the way witches
used to scry into crystal balls or entrails.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.256
She was communicating.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.301
-With the Daeva?
-No. You said those things were savages.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.512
No, this was someone different.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.431
Someone who's giving her orders.
Someone...

21:05.640 --> 21:07.976
...who's coming to that warehouse.

21:16.401 --> 21:17.652
Holy crap.

21:17.986 --> 21:20.613
-What?
-What I was gonna tell you earlier.

21:20.822 --> 21:25.910
I pulled a favor with my friend
Amy over at the police department.

21:26.452 --> 21:30.456
The complete records of the two victims.
We missed something the first time.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.458
What?

21:32.667 --> 21:36.462
The first victim, the old man,
he spent his whole life in Chicago...

21:36.671 --> 21:39.465
...but he wasn't born here.
Look where he was born.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.051
-Lawrence, Kansas.
-Mm-hm.

21:42.885 --> 21:45.013
And Meredith, the second victim?

21:45.221 --> 21:47.932
Turns out she was adopted.
Guess where she's from.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.692
-Holy crap.
-Yeah.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.028
It is where the demon killed Mom.

22:00.695 --> 22:04.073
It's where everything started. You
think Meg's tied up with the demon?

22:04.282 --> 22:07.410
-It's a definite possibility.
-What's the significance of Lawrence?

22:07.493 --> 22:10.538
-And how do these Daeva things fit in?
-Beats me.

22:10.621 --> 22:14.333
I say we trash that black altar,
grab Meg and have an interrogation.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.086
No. We can't.
We shouldn't tip her off.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.506
We gotta stake out that warehouse.
We gotta see who...

22:20.590 --> 22:23.926
-...or what is showing up to meet her.
-I'll tell you one thing...

22:24.135 --> 22:26.137
...I don't think we should
do this alone.

22:28.598 --> 22:31.601
We think we got a serious lead
on the thing that killed Mom.

22:31.684 --> 22:37.482
So.... This warehouse,
it's 1435 West Erie.

22:38.107 --> 22:42.070
Dad, if you get this,
get to Chicago as soon as you can.

22:42.612 --> 22:45.907
-Voice mail?
-Yeah.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.410
Jeez. What'd you get?

22:49.660 --> 22:53.539
I ransacked that trunk. Holy water,
every weapon that I could think of.

22:54.123 --> 22:58.669
Exorcism rituals from
about a half-dozen religions.

22:59.170 --> 23:03.174
I'm not sure what to expect, so I guess
we should just expect everything, huh?

23:13.392 --> 23:16.020
-Big night.
-Yeah.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.731
Nervous?

23:19.273 --> 23:21.526
No. No. Are you?

23:22.610 --> 23:24.529
No. No way.

23:32.662 --> 23:36.040
Could you imagine if we actually
found that damn thing? That demon?

23:36.290 --> 23:40.044
-Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
-I know. I'm just saying...

23:40.294 --> 23:42.505
...what if we did?

23:42.588 --> 23:45.550
What if this whole thing
was over tonight?

23:45.675 --> 23:47.677
Man, I'd sleep for a month.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.679
Go back to school.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.223
Just be a person again.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.811
-You wanna go back to school?
-Yeah, once we're done hunting it.

23:57.228 --> 23:58.563
Huh.

23:58.855 --> 24:01.524
-Is there something wrong with that?
-No. No.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.693
It's great. Good for you.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.821
I mean....

24:06.946 --> 24:10.366
-What are you gonna do when it's over?
-It's never gonna be over.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.578
There's gonna be others.
There's gonna be something to hunt.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.955
There's gotta be something
you want for yourself.

24:16.164 --> 24:19.417
Yeah, I don't want you to leave
the second this thing's over, Sam.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.420
Dude, what's your problem?

24:26.591 --> 24:27.758
(DEAN CHUCKLES)

24:29.051 --> 24:32.263
Why do you think
I drag you everywhere? Huh?

24:33.014 --> 24:34.515
Why do you think I came...

24:34.807 --> 24:37.435
-...and got you at Stanford?
-Because Dad was in trouble.

24:37.727 --> 24:41.689
-You wanted to find what killed Mom.
-Yes, that, but it's more than that, man.

24:48.237 --> 24:51.782
You and me and Dad.

24:52.783 --> 24:56.120
I mean, I want us
to be together again.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.459
I want us to be a family again.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.545
Dean, we are a family.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.048
I'd do anything for you.

25:07.465 --> 25:10.134
But things will never be
the way they were before.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.767
Could be.

25:22.563 --> 25:23.689
I don't want them to be.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.820
I'm not gonna live this life forever.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.950
Dean, when this is all over...

25:34.784 --> 25:37.453
...you're gonna have
to let me go my own way.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.924
(MEG CHANTING)

26:39.640 --> 26:41.225
MEG:
Guys.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.811
Hiding's a little bit childish,
don't you think?

26:43.894 --> 26:46.605
Well, that didn't work out
like I'd planned.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.027
Why don't you come out.

27:00.328 --> 27:01.787
Sam...

27:01.996 --> 27:05.124
...I have to say, this puts a real
crimp in our relationship.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.792
Yeah, tell me about it.

27:08.586 --> 27:11.839
-So where's your little Daeva friend?
-Around.

27:12.048 --> 27:15.551
-The shotgun's not gonna do much good.
DEAN: Well, don't worry, sweetheart.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.011
Shotgun's not for the demon.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.597
So who is it, Meg?

27:19.805 --> 27:22.141
Who's coming?
Who are you waiting for?

27:23.976 --> 27:25.561
You.

27:32.068 --> 27:33.778
(GRUNTING)

27:38.157 --> 27:39.617
Aah!

27:54.090 --> 27:55.591
Hey, Sam?

27:55.800 --> 27:58.803
Don't take this the wrong way,
but your girlfriend...

27:59.011 --> 28:00.596
...is a bitch.

28:01.764 --> 28:03.099
SAM:
This....

28:03.474 --> 28:05.935
The whole thing was a trap.

28:07.645 --> 28:09.772
Running into you at the bar.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.774
SAM:
Following you here...

28:12.024 --> 28:13.651
...hearing what you had to say.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.612
It was all a setup, wasn't it?

28:17.613 --> 28:20.491
-That the victims were from Lawrence?
MEG: Doesn't mean anything.

28:21.575 --> 28:25.204
-It was just to draw you in.
-You killed those two people for nothing.

28:25.413 --> 28:27.581
Baby, I've killed a lot more
for a lot less.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.460

You trapped us.

28:31.669 --> 28:33.337
Good for you.

28:33.587 --> 28:36.507
It's Miller time.
Why don't you kill us already?

28:37.800 --> 28:40.845
Not very quick on the uptake, are we?

28:45.850 --> 28:47.726
This trap isn't for you.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.274
Dad.

28:53.524 --> 28:54.650
It's a trap for Dad.

28:57.653 --> 29:01.157
Well, sweetheart,
you're dumber than you look.

29:01.365 --> 29:04.493
Because even if Dad was in town,
which he is not...

29:04.702 --> 29:06.620
...he wouldn't walk into this.
He's too good.

29:06.829 --> 29:10.291
He is pretty good,
I'll give you that.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.840
But you see...

29:23.053 --> 29:25.931
-...he has one weakness.
-What's that?

29:26.849 --> 29:28.767
You.

29:29.643 --> 29:32.021
He lets his guard down
around his boys.

29:32.688 --> 29:35.524
Lets his emotions
cloud his judgments.

29:37.526 --> 29:40.196
I happen to know he is in town.

29:41.739 --> 29:44.909
And he'll come and try to save you.

29:45.159 --> 29:48.287
And then the Daevas
will kill everybody...

29:48.496 --> 29:52.666
...nice and slow and messy.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.793
DEAN:
Well, I got news for you.

29:55.044 --> 29:58.380
It's gonna take a lot more than
some shadow to kill him.

29:58.589 --> 30:01.675
MEG: Oh, the Daevas are in the room here.
They're invisible.

30:01.759 --> 30:03.928
Their shadows are
the only part you can see.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.596
SAM:
Why you doing this, Meg?

30:05.679 --> 30:08.057
What kind of deal you got
worked out here, huh?

30:08.599 --> 30:10.392
-And with who?
-I'm doing this...

30:10.684 --> 30:13.062
...for the same reasons
you do what you do.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.897
Loyalty.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.690
Love.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.944
Like the love you have for Mommy.

30:20.194 --> 30:23.322
-And Jess.
-Go to hell.

30:24.198 --> 30:26.784
Baby, I'm already there.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.539
Come on, Sam.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.458
There's no need to be nasty.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.549
I think we both know...

30:42.466 --> 30:45.344
...how you really feel about me.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.724
You know...

30:53.394 --> 30:57.773
...I saw you watching me...

30:57.982 --> 31:00.025
...changing in my apartment.

31:00.276 --> 31:02.778
It turned you on, didn't it?

31:03.862 --> 31:06.282
-Get a room, you two.
-I didn't mind.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.867
I liked that you were watching me.

31:09.118 --> 31:11.078
Come on, Sammy.

31:11.287 --> 31:13.831
You and I can still have
a little dirty fun.

31:14.123 --> 31:17.585
You wanna have fun? Go ahead then.

31:17.668 --> 31:20.504

while your brother cuts free?

No.

32:03.297 --> 32:04.882
No.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.719
It was because
I have a knife of my own.

32:10.721 --> 32:14.224
-Aah!
-Sam. Get the altar.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.526
Aah!

No. No.

Yeah.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.208
There.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.767
So I guess the Daevas
didn't like being bossed around.

32:56.850 --> 32:58.852
I guess not.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.188
-Hey, Sam?
-Hm?

33:01.397 --> 33:03.816
Next time you wanna get laid...

33:03.899 --> 33:07.111
...find a girl that's not so
buckets of crazy, huh?

33:21.875 --> 33:24.712
Why didn't you just leave
that stuff in the car?

33:24.795 --> 33:28.799
I said it before and I'll say it again:
Better safe than sorry.

-Hey, boys.

-Hi, Sam.
-Hey, Dad.

34:26.023 --> 34:28.025
Dad, it was a trap.

34:29.026 --> 34:31.403
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

34:31.612 --> 34:34.573
It's all right.
I thought it might have been.

34:34.782 --> 34:36.033
-Were you there?
JOHN: Yeah.

34:36.241 --> 34:39.077
I got there just in time
to see the girl take the swan dive.

34:39.953 --> 34:41.872
She was the bad guy, right?

34:41.955 --> 34:43.373
(IN UNISON): Yes, sir.
-Good.

34:43.957 --> 34:48.337
Well, it doesn't surprise me.
It's tried to stop me before.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.715
-The demon has?
JOHN: It knows I'm close.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.717
It knows I'm gonna kill it.

34:54.009 --> 34:57.262
JOHN: Not just exorcise it
or send it back to hell.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.015
Actually kill it.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.601
How?

35:03.227 --> 35:04.895
I'm working on that.

35:06.063 --> 35:08.482
Well, let us come with you.
We'll help.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.401
No, Sam.

35:12.486 --> 35:15.405
Not yet.
Listen, try to understand...

35:15.697 --> 35:18.909
...this demon
is a scary son of a bitch.

I don't want you hurt.

together we had one hell of a fight.

Yes, sir.

35:48.564 --> 35:51.108
It's good to see you again.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.485

Dean, we should stick together.

38:20.048 --> 38:23.218
-We'll go after this demon together.
-Sam, listen to me.

38:25.512 --> 38:27.431
We almost got Dad killed in there.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.101
Don't you understand?
They're not gonna stop.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.271
They're gonna try again.
They're gonna use us to get to him.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.106
I mean, Meg was right.

38:37.441 --> 38:39.026
Dad's vulnerable when he's with us.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.906
He's stronger without us around.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.618
Dad.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.830
No.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.250
After everything.

38:55.459 --> 38:59.254
After all the time we've spent
looking for you.... Please.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.550
-I gotta be a part of this fight.
-Sammy, this fight is just starting.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.470
And we are all gonna have
a part to play.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.138
For now, you gotta trust me, son.

39:11.725 --> 39:14.269
Okay? You gotta let me go.

39:59.106 --> 40:00.482
Be careful, boys.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.902
Come on.
