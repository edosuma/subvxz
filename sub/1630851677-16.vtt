WEBVTT

00:47.003 --> 00:49.266
What happened to our power?

00:49.440 --> 00:51.138
Boomer?

01:56.725 --> 01:58.292
OPERATOR
Los Angeles 911.

01:58.422 --> 01:59.554
Do you need police,
fire, or medical?

01:59.728 --> 02:01.077
Police.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.384
What is the nature
of your emergency?

02:03.558 --> 02:04.994
Someone broke into my house.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.301
Are you in the house now?

02:07.431 --> 02:08.867
It's been a kidnapping.

02:08.998 --> 02:11.870
Who was kidnapped, ma'am?

02:12.044 --> 02:13.698
Ma'am, are you still
on the line?

02:53.825 --> 02:56.132
Hey.

02:56.306 --> 02:59.179
Getting some early morning
shooting in, hoss?

02:59.353 --> 03:00.397
Yeah.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.009
You put any more rounds
in that thing,

03:04.140 --> 03:05.794
you'll melt
the barrel off.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.709
Right.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.584
So... what's up?

03:13.715 --> 03:14.933
Nothing.

03:15.107 --> 03:17.501
Still one-word answers,

03:17.675 --> 03:19.590
but at least we're moving up
to two syllables.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.505
You've been hanging out
with Kilbride too much.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.551
You're starting
to talk like him.
Oh, my God,

03:23.725 --> 03:26.075
you're right. That was a very
Admiralesque thing to say.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.903
Do we havea case?

03:28.077 --> 03:30.384
Oh, I don't know.
Since Shyla's here,

03:30.558 --> 03:31.994
I am steering clear
of the cyber tower.

03:34.866 --> 03:37.042
You want to...

03:37.217 --> 03:38.609
talk about anything?

03:38.740 --> 03:41.351
Like what?
Well,

03:41.525 --> 03:43.614
I don't know, as someone
who's suffered

03:43.745 --> 03:45.442
a pretty frightening trauma,
I can

03:45.616 --> 03:47.270
understand what you're
going through,

03:47.401 --> 03:49.141
and I know that no matter
how hard you try to let it go,

03:49.316 --> 03:51.013
it's not easy.
If you're
talking about my stop

03:51.187 --> 03:52.406
with the police,
I'm over it.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.886
I put it behind me.
I'm good.

03:55.060 --> 03:58.325
Honestly, it's somebody else's
legal problem now.

03:58.499 --> 03:59.326
Okay.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.111
Then why does it look like

04:02.285 --> 04:03.591
Assault on Precinct 13in here?

04:03.765 --> 04:05.245
What?

04:05.419 --> 04:06.289
The John Carpenter film--
Did you even have

04:06.463 --> 04:07.856
a television as a kid?

04:07.986 --> 04:08.857
I mean,
most of the time, no.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.511
Right.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.077
Well, I'm putting it
on the list.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.862
Look, please don't, okay?

04:13.992 --> 04:16.125
I don't know why everybody wants
me to watch these old movies.

04:16.299 --> 04:17.474
Deeks made me watch Hair,

04:17.648 --> 04:19.171
and he sang every
single song.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.783
That was more traumatizing
than Get Out.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.351
Well, if you want to experience
something traumatizing,

04:24.525 --> 04:26.091
let Kilbride come in here
and see this place

04:26.266 --> 04:27.919
looking like the Tet Offensive.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.617
Then you'll seriously have
some explaining to do.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.751
Yeah, I'll get a broom.Yeah.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.492
You do that.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.765
Please don't tell me that
you stood me up this morning

04:47.896 --> 04:49.985
so you could get here early
and nab Kilbride's parking spot.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.770
For the record,
it's no one's official spot.

04:52.901 --> 04:55.817
Ah. Well, I'm pretty sure the
admiral sees things differently.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.471
Look, I told you
I was sorry I forgot

04:57.645 --> 04:58.341
you were picking me up
this morning, right?

04:58.515 --> 04:59.821
You hate my driving, don't you?

04:59.995 --> 05:01.301
With every fiber of my being,

05:01.475 --> 05:02.476
but has nothing to do with that.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.653
You didn't come home
last night, did you?

05:08.569 --> 05:10.484
You hooked up
with that rheumatologist.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.399
Endocrinologist,

05:12.573 --> 05:14.966
and I did not "hook up"
with her, frat boy.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.751
Oh, it was the stunt woman.

05:16.925 --> 05:17.926
Yeah, that-that makes sense. She
was a little more your style.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.929
Not my style and no.

05:21.103 --> 05:23.018
Please don't tell me it was
the bartender with the tattoos

05:23.192 --> 05:23.932
and the piercings.
I mean, she was cute,

05:24.106 --> 05:25.194
but a little circus scary.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.848
What's wrong with you?

05:27.022 --> 05:28.415
I'm just, I'm just
being a friend.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.068
This is your idea of friendship?

05:30.242 --> 05:31.113
No wonder you
don't have any friends.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.506
I have tons of friends.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.290
Name three.
You...

05:34.421 --> 05:35.900
That you don't work with.Anna...

05:36.074 --> 05:38.599
Or date.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.078
Maybe if you had
gone home with somebody,

05:40.252 --> 05:41.123
you wouldn't be
in such a foul mood.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.777
Okay, okay.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.344
Honestly, what's going on?

05:47.434 --> 05:49.349
Your boat?

05:49.523 --> 05:52.090
You're selling Michelle?Why?

05:52.264 --> 05:54.049
I got to get a house.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.355
I'm pretty sure you told me

05:55.529 --> 05:57.008
you were never gonna
own a house again.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.184
Got no choice.
My dad's gotten to the point

05:59.315 --> 06:01.012
where he can't live alone.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.537
You're buying a house so that
your dad can move in with you?

06:03.667 --> 06:04.973
Yeah.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.191
And he's okay with that?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.236
I haven't told him yet.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.411
I'm getting the house first.

06:08.585 --> 06:09.978
That seems a little backwards,

06:10.108 --> 06:11.327
if you ask me.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.981
It's precisely why
I didn't ask you.

06:13.111 --> 06:16.114
How's he doing?

06:16.245 --> 06:19.248
He's had better days.Yeah.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.728
Any idea what you're
dealing with?

06:20.902 --> 06:23.339
Not yet. Uh...

06:24.949 --> 06:27.343
Tried to get him in for testing,
he refused to go. He's stubborn.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.737
Ah, imagine that.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.697
Well, seriously,
if there's anything I can do...

06:33.871 --> 06:35.830
You could let him
move in with you.

06:36.004 --> 06:39.355
And that is precisely why
I don't want friends.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.270
Good morning, gentlemen.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.011
Good morning.
The admiral
would like to see you,

06:43.141 --> 06:45.361
Agent Callen.Thanks.

06:45.492 --> 06:48.059
Hm, nice boat,
Agent Hanna.

06:48.233 --> 06:51.280
You like that?
It's for sale.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.674
I'm more of a city mouse,
but if you've got

06:53.848 --> 06:55.327
a two-bedroom in Chelsea
you want to unload

06:55.502 --> 06:56.590
for a steal, I'm your girl.

06:56.720 --> 06:57.852
So, you don't like
the ocean, huh?

07:04.119 --> 07:04.946
You wanted to see me, Admiral?

07:05.076 --> 07:07.209
Yes, uh,

07:07.383 --> 07:09.298
come on in,
have a seat.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.650
The, uh, request
that you filed

07:13.824 --> 07:16.044
under the Freedom
of Information Act

07:16.174 --> 07:17.828
has been denied.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.528
Huh.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.837
How did this come across
your desk?

07:26.968 --> 07:29.884
This was a private and, uh,

07:30.058 --> 07:31.668
personal inquiry.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.067
Why was it denied?

07:39.241 --> 07:40.895
Use your imagination.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.288
'Cause of you?

07:43.419 --> 07:46.901
No.
This is above my pay grade.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.514
"Exemption 1, the requested

07:51.645 --> 07:53.081
"information is
classified to protect

07:53.255 --> 07:55.344
national security."

07:57.389 --> 07:58.782
They're gonna hide
behind national security?

07:58.956 --> 08:00.654
They're funny that way.

08:00.828 --> 08:03.918
I know that this is a big
disappointment for you,

08:04.092 --> 08:05.528
and that you would

08:05.659 --> 08:07.574
very much like to speak
with Henrietta

08:07.748 --> 08:10.141
about her involvement
in the Drona program.

08:13.101 --> 08:14.276
So, you do know about it.

08:14.450 --> 08:17.627
I know of it...

08:17.801 --> 08:19.368
but not to the extent
to help you

08:19.542 --> 08:21.109
find the answers I believe

08:21.283 --> 08:22.545
you're looking for.

08:22.719 --> 08:23.938
On another front,

08:24.112 --> 08:26.680
NCISHQ-MTAC

08:26.810 --> 08:29.465
and CYBER
have been working

08:29.596 --> 08:31.946
around the clock
to hunt down any more

08:32.120 --> 08:34.426
of your deep fakes.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.604
They have also put
a security perimeter

08:37.778 --> 08:40.476
around your digital life,
so if this

08:40.650 --> 08:44.262
Katie Miller,
aka Katya Mironova,

08:44.436 --> 08:46.177
tries anything,
they'll shut her down.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.355
Thank you. I appreciate that.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.444
Hmm.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.490
I have also made arrangements

08:54.664 --> 08:58.146
for operational psychologist
Nate Getz

08:58.276 --> 09:00.496
to meet
with you today.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.628
Nate?

09:01.802 --> 09:03.543
Why?

09:03.717 --> 09:06.371
Because this job
is a lot to deal with,

09:06.502 --> 09:08.722
and I need
the entire team

09:08.896 --> 09:12.160
to be operating
at peak performance.

09:12.334 --> 09:15.076
Well, I don't need
to speak with Nate for that.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.341
He's also been working
with Henrietta in Syria.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.042
In what capacity?

09:25.216 --> 09:27.958
He was profiling some
of the al-Qaeda terrorists

09:28.089 --> 09:29.743
she was negotiating with.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.483
I just thought you might want
to speak with him.

09:31.658 --> 09:35.052
Deeks is giving a deposition
in court today,

09:35.226 --> 09:37.098
so Sam can work
with Kensi.

09:37.272 --> 09:40.667
Take as much time as you need.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.196
Thank you.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.600
What's up, Shyla?

10:00.774 --> 10:03.080
Well, 911 received
an emergency call

10:03.254 --> 10:04.865
at 1542 yesterday
from this woman.

10:05.039 --> 10:07.084
Retired Marine Gunnery
Sergeant Mary Smith.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.434
She came home from a workout
at her local gym

10:09.565 --> 10:10.610
and grabbing
some takeout

10:10.784 --> 10:12.220
to find that her home
had been broken into.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.222
And this concerns us
because...

10:14.352 --> 10:16.180
Because, according to Smith,
it was a kidnapping.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.269
Who was kidnapped?

10:18.443 --> 10:20.837
Recently retired Marine
Master Sergeant Boomer Hayes.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.666
That's a nickname, right?
Like...

10:23.797 --> 10:25.799
No dude's real name
is Boomer.

10:26.930 --> 10:30.717
Meet Marine Master
Sergeant Boomer Hayes.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.982
That's a dog.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.867
Is this a case
or a missing pet?

10:51.041 --> 10:52.913
Master Sergeant Hayes
is an MWD,

10:53.087 --> 10:55.045
or military
working dog.

10:55.176 --> 10:58.266
She's punking us.
This has got to be a joke.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.311
I assure you
this is no joke,

11:00.485 --> 11:01.965
Agent Rountree.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.098
So we're looking
for dog-nappers now?

11:04.272 --> 11:06.317
No, we are looking
for those

11:06.491 --> 11:08.711
who may have kidnapped
a Marine Corps

11:08.842 --> 11:11.279
Master Sergeant.
Now, Agents Hanna

11:11.409 --> 11:13.281
and Blye will be speaking
with his

11:13.411 --> 11:15.979
former handler and now owner,
Gunnery Sergeant

11:16.153 --> 11:18.503
Smith. I want you two
to visit the crime scene,

11:18.634 --> 11:20.288
see if anything
was missed.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.246
Copy that.
Okay.

11:24.509 --> 11:25.989
I've worked with Boomer
for over three years

11:26.163 --> 11:27.425
as a Marine and now

11:27.599 --> 11:29.166
two years as
a reserve deputy sheriff.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.299
I was allowed to adopt him
when we both retired.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.605
We've worked for the
L.A. Sheriff's Department

11:33.780 --> 11:36.913
in the reserve unit and in
the private sector ever since.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.393
Doing what?

11:38.567 --> 11:39.437
Helping out wherever
we're needed

11:39.568 --> 11:40.438
with various
law enforcement.

11:40.569 --> 11:43.659
These dogs are brilliant.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.530
What makes you think that
anybody would want to steal him?

11:45.661 --> 11:47.968
Well, not just anybody.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.057
My ex-boyfriend, Dennis.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.016
Why would he be doing this?

11:53.190 --> 11:55.105
He was always jealous of Boomer.

11:55.236 --> 11:56.716
He never really warmed to him.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.326
So I take it
it was a bad breakup?

11:58.456 --> 12:00.241
You could say that.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.025
Did you try
calling him?

12:02.199 --> 12:03.592
He's blocked my number.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.160
I went to his house,
he wasn't there.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.553
I'm, uh, trying not to worry,

12:08.684 --> 12:10.860
or let my thoughts
get away from me, but...

12:11.034 --> 12:12.035
Do you think
he would hurt Boomer?

12:12.209 --> 12:14.168
I don't know.

12:14.342 --> 12:17.649
I've heard stories of
really ugly divorces where

12:17.824 --> 12:21.001
someone fights for custody
of the family pet and wins,

12:21.175 --> 12:23.394
and then has the animal put down

12:23.568 --> 12:24.918
just to hurt the other person.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.571
Mm, that's horrible.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.443
Don't worry,
if your ex has him,

12:28.617 --> 12:30.184
we'll get him back.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.973
Hey, man.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.845
Sorry about that. I, uh...

12:39.019 --> 12:40.803
had to give a little pep talk
to a patient,

12:40.977 --> 12:42.152
you know, needs to get
on a plane.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.634
What do you think?

12:45.808 --> 12:48.071
Well, it's a lot
bigger and nicer

12:48.245 --> 12:50.465
than your old broom closet
back at OSP.

12:50.639 --> 12:51.945
You sure this is
your office?

12:52.119 --> 12:54.034
You were expecting
a bookcase of psych books,

12:54.208 --> 12:57.298
framed photo of Freud,
and, uh, ink blot wallpaper?

12:57.472 --> 12:58.734
I don't know, it
just...

12:58.908 --> 13:00.214
...feels more like a day spa.

13:00.388 --> 13:01.868
That's the idea.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.044
I want people to feel
relaxed and safe

13:04.218 --> 13:05.523
when they walk
through those doors.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.091
Can I get you anything?
Uh, coffee? Water?

13:08.222 --> 13:09.614
Herbal tea?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.616
It really is a spa.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.531
Have a seat.

13:17.448 --> 13:20.060
So...

13:20.234 --> 13:21.757
...how are you doing?

13:21.888 --> 13:25.369
I am well. Real well.In fact,

13:25.543 --> 13:27.284
I don't want to take up a lot
of your time 'cause I know

13:27.458 --> 13:29.721
you're very busy,
but Kilbride

13:29.896 --> 13:33.029
mentioned that you have
some information pertaining

13:33.203 --> 13:35.466
to Hetty in Syria.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.209
I have a little, um,
but nothing recent.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.559
As you well know,
Hetty only allows you to know

13:41.733 --> 13:43.648
as much as she needs to serve
her purposes.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.477
Only too well.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.134
So, what are we thinking, they
came through the broken window,

13:51.308 --> 13:53.963
grabbed the dog
and went out the glass door?

13:54.137 --> 13:56.096
Yeah, but they had to cut
the power first.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.925
Her security alarm system
has backup battery power.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.318
Which means
they circumvented the alarm.

14:01.449 --> 14:04.017
That's pretty sophisticated
for a smash and grab thief.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.193
Yeah, and our Master Sergeant
is also highly trained.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.673
We're referring to him
as Master Sergeant now?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.371
What? That's his rank.

14:10.545 --> 14:11.720
Yeah, okay.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.943
He would've protected
this home with his life.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.466
Unless he knew the person
that broke in.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.685
And actually
liked them.

14:20.816 --> 14:21.817
Or they drugged him first.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.732
They toss in
some food laced

14:23.906 --> 14:25.560
with a sedative,

14:25.734 --> 14:27.954
wait an hour or so,
come back in, carry him out.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.608
That would explain
the glass sliding door.

14:30.739 --> 14:33.611
How so?
So, you climb in

14:33.785 --> 14:35.744
through the broken window
'cause it's hidden from view,

14:35.918 --> 14:37.833
but then you want to go out
the back through the glass

14:38.007 --> 14:39.269
sliding door because
you don't want to go back out

14:39.400 --> 14:41.184
through the window
with a sedated Master Sergeant.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.926
Yeah, that dog's got to weigh--
I mean, Master Sergeant,

14:44.100 --> 14:45.580
he's got to weigh

14:45.754 --> 14:48.583
about 60, 75 pounds.
That's a pretty heavy carry.

14:48.757 --> 14:51.020
That would explain why
the sliding door was left open.

14:51.194 --> 14:53.805
All right, so we're looking
for someone who's really strong

14:53.980 --> 14:55.982
or it was
a two-person team.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.200
And they would need to get
Master Sergeant into

14:57.374 --> 14:59.115
some sort of vehicle
with a restraint,

14:59.289 --> 15:01.117
like a muzzle, because
the last thing you need

15:01.291 --> 15:03.641
is a military K9 waking up
while you're kidnapping him.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.426
Damn right,
that'll ruin your day.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.297
Well, we know when Mary
discovered the break-in,

15:07.428 --> 15:09.517
so we just backtrack
for vehicles in the area,

15:09.691 --> 15:11.345
see if we get lucky.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.741
Why would I want

15:16.872 --> 15:18.352
her dog?
He didn't even like me.

15:18.526 --> 15:19.266
Is that true?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.442
Yes.

15:21.616 --> 15:24.880
Boomer was a better judge
of character than me, obviously.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.099
Why didn't he like you?

15:26.229 --> 15:29.319
Because I'm a Taurus,
and-and he's an Aries.

15:29.450 --> 15:33.019
How the hell
would I know? He's a dog.

15:33.193 --> 15:35.891
Maybe he was jealous that I was
sleeping with his girlfriend.

15:36.065 --> 15:38.372
Or I can walk
on two feet.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.635
He's such an idiot.

15:40.809 --> 15:43.551
Boomer's not even an Aries,
he's a Sagittarius.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.248
He doesn't even know
his birthday.Or maybe you were jealous

15:45.422 --> 15:46.989
of Boomer?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.643
Saw him as competition
for Mary's affection.

15:48.817 --> 15:49.949
I can't believe you can
say that with a straight face.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.386
Did it ever cross
your mind that maybe

15:52.560 --> 15:56.042
Boomer and I had developed
a forbidden relationship?

15:56.216 --> 15:59.219
Mary found out about it, and she
killed him in a jealous rage.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.960
He's not taking this
very seriously.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.310
He doesn't take
anything seriously.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.399
He's about to.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.792
Or maybe you decided to get
back at Mary for dumping you.

16:07.923 --> 16:11.057
She did not dump me.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.842
Is that what she said?

16:14.016 --> 16:15.278
I kicked him out,
and he knows it.

16:15.452 --> 16:16.497
Okay, look,

16:16.671 --> 16:18.412
I apologize
for the sarcasm,

16:18.586 --> 16:20.849
but you and I both know that
I don't even have to talk to you

16:21.023 --> 16:22.894
without legal
representation.

16:23.069 --> 16:26.376
I have nothing to do with this,
but I-I'm still trying to help.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.422
If you keep wasting
my time and yours

16:28.596 --> 16:30.511
by pursuing me
as a suspect, however,

16:30.685 --> 16:32.730
I'm gonna have
to lawyer up

16:32.904 --> 16:35.037
and put an end
to my cooperation.

16:35.211 --> 16:36.908
If you didn't take him,
where is he?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.389
Who am I now,
Ace Pet Detective?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.087
I have no idea,

16:41.261 --> 16:43.002
and I'm starting not to care.This dog

16:43.176 --> 16:44.220
is considered a Marine,

16:44.394 --> 16:45.700
which means
he is afforded

16:45.874 --> 16:47.267
the same legal status.

16:47.441 --> 16:50.009
Yup, if I hear that one more
time, I am going to puke.

16:50.183 --> 16:51.401
Look, if that dog

16:51.532 --> 16:52.881
is so damn smart,
he probably ran away,

16:53.055 --> 16:55.797
just like I did
because his owner is cuckoo.

16:55.971 --> 16:57.625
Boomer would never run away.

16:57.755 --> 16:58.974
Who else would want him?

16:59.148 --> 17:01.846
Everyone who met him
loved him.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.632
Except for the criminals
he helped you catch.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.341
I take it we're looking
at some of Gunny Smith

17:18.515 --> 17:20.300
and Master Sergeant
Hayes' work?

17:20.474 --> 17:22.519
They make a
formidable team.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.739
Together, they've taken
over $300 million worth

17:24.913 --> 17:26.219
of illegal drugs
off the streets.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.003
Reason enough
to kidnap him.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.658
Bad guys want him off the job.

17:30.788 --> 17:32.573
That's what
Agent Hanna suggested,

17:32.747 --> 17:33.878
but if that's the case,
then why not just kill him?

17:34.009 --> 17:35.706
If they knew
where he lives,

17:35.880 --> 17:37.099
they could've
just poisoned him

17:37.230 --> 17:38.492
or tried to shoot him
during a drive-by.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.668
Well, perhaps they felt it
too risky,

17:40.798 --> 17:44.106
or maybe they wanted the
Master Sergeant for themselves.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.761
Drug-sniffing canine
could help eliminate

17:46.935 --> 17:48.458
your competitor'sproduct.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.677
No product,
no competition.

17:49.851 --> 17:51.592
But Boomer's not a Roomba.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.550
There's much more
interaction and nuance

17:53.724 --> 17:55.639
between the canine
and his handler.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.773
I am not suggesting that those
who stole him are geniuses.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.992
I'm sure they'll find
out the hard way

18:01.167 --> 18:03.734
that a Marine is not someone
you want to tangle with,

18:03.908 --> 18:06.259
whether he's got
two legs or four.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.130
Have you and Boomer
ever been the subject

18:08.304 --> 18:09.392
of any death threats?

18:09.566 --> 18:11.220
Not to my knowledge, but

18:11.394 --> 18:12.874
it's not like people
really knew who we were.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.181
Mm, not necessarily.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.270
I mean, some of the cases
you helped on,

18:17.400 --> 18:18.749
they did end up on the news.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.925
So you think
someone targeted Boomer

18:21.100 --> 18:22.405
to get him off the street?

18:22.579 --> 18:24.277
He cost a lot of people
a lot of money.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.322
People have been killed
for far less.

18:26.496 --> 18:30.152
I mean, he was just doing
what he was trained to do.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.980
Right, and you know
that, and we know that.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.199
But, look, it's
also possible

18:33.373 --> 18:34.722
that somebody just thought
he was beautiful

18:34.852 --> 18:35.853
and decided to steal him.

18:36.027 --> 18:37.507
I mean, it's not uncommon with

18:37.638 --> 18:39.988
expensive breeds.Or maybe they

18:40.162 --> 18:42.469
kidnapped him for ransom, if
they knew how valuable he was.

18:42.643 --> 18:45.167
I guess, if that was
the case, we would've received

18:45.298 --> 18:47.169
a ransom note by now, huh?It's difficult to say.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.215
Excuse me.
Yeah, of course.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.656
Hey, Dad. What's up?

18:58.398 --> 19:00.661
I'll be damned if I know.

19:00.835 --> 19:03.403
Somehow, I got turned
around, and...

19:03.577 --> 19:05.666
I don't know where I am.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.624
Are you driving?

19:07.798 --> 19:10.453
Not at the moment.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.456
There's so much
new construction everywhere.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.677
Every time you turn around,
there's a new building.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.244
Where's Mrs. Ainsley?

19:19.767 --> 19:21.160
Got me.

19:21.334 --> 19:24.685
She's supposed to be with you.Well...

19:24.859 --> 19:26.774
she's not.

19:26.904 --> 19:28.906
All right, Dad, do you have
your keys with you?

19:29.037 --> 19:31.692
Okay. Uh, that...

19:31.866 --> 19:33.911
Dad?Hold your horses,

19:34.042 --> 19:36.784
I-I'm looking.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.787
Yup, yup. I-I... got my keys.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.919
I don't know where
I parked, though.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.834
All right, Dad, listen to me.

19:44.008 --> 19:46.707
I need you to find a place
to sit and stay put, all right?

19:46.881 --> 19:50.014
Just leave your phone on, don't
go anywhere. You understand?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.365
I was probably so busy thinking

19:52.495 --> 19:54.584
that I walked right past
the car.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.021
Unless...Dad.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.675
Unless it's in the next block.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.504
Dad, I need you to stop walking,
stop talking.

20:01.678 --> 20:05.073
Find a place to sit
and stay put, okay?

20:05.247 --> 20:08.381
Leave your phone on.Don't tell me to stop talking.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.385
Sorry to have bothered you.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.650
Oh, man.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.173
Wow.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.003
MAJOR
You've reached the Major.
Leave a message.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.704
Is everything okay?No, it's my dad.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.489
He went out without
his caretaker, and he's lost.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.534
I need to go to OPS
and trace his phone.Yeah, go, go.

20:31.708 --> 20:34.233
You sure?Yeah, yeah,
of course. Go, go.

20:36.757 --> 20:39.238
I received a cryptic text
on an open line a few weeks ago.

20:39.412 --> 20:42.328
It simply said,
"The game's afoot."

20:42.502 --> 20:44.243
Sherlock Holmes.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.766
Shakespeare, originally.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.942
Henry V.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.770
It's from his,
"Once more unto the breach,

20:49.944 --> 20:51.032
dear friends" speech.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.643
Sounds like Hetty.It does.

20:53.774 --> 20:57.168
And I think she also meant
she's actually on foot with,

20:57.343 --> 20:59.258
or going after,
Al Kalmira.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.999
I've heard
nothing since.

21:02.173 --> 21:04.959
Hetty wasn't alone over there.
Harris Keane was with her.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.743
How do you know that?

21:06.874 --> 21:08.876
Because I spoke with him
on the day of the bombing.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.490
I sent someone
to look for Hetty.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.753
Who?

21:16.884 --> 21:19.930
You don't know them. Foreign
operative who was burned.

21:20.104 --> 21:22.324
Helping each other out.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.544
Thank you for that information.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.676
Please let me know if you hear
anything else, and, uh,

21:26.850 --> 21:28.156
I'll do the same.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.332
What about Katya
and the deep fakes?

21:31.855 --> 21:33.509
What about it?

21:33.683 --> 21:35.337
Doesn't have anything to do
with this, does it?

21:35.511 --> 21:37.557
I have no idea. They certainly

21:37.731 --> 21:40.168
don't help.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.344
Any word from her since you

21:42.475 --> 21:43.824
recovered the film reel
from her vault?

21:45.739 --> 21:48.524
No. Um...

21:48.698 --> 21:50.483
And the deep fakes
have gone quiet as well.

21:50.613 --> 21:53.573
I... The film
may be the key

21:53.703 --> 21:55.749
to tracking her down.
Either that or she's just

21:55.923 --> 21:57.141
decided to lay low for a while.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.841
Or she's taking a break
to regroup.

22:01.015 --> 22:02.930
Prepare a larger
response.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.933
Not exactly the reassurance
I was hoping for.

22:06.063 --> 22:08.544
But Kilbride has

22:08.718 --> 22:10.154
all the men he can muster

22:10.285 --> 22:11.721
working to find them,
take them down.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.332
Hopefully, Katya will slip up,

22:13.506 --> 22:15.725
and we'll be able
to track her down.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.292
Thanks again.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.599
What about the Drona Project?

22:22.210 --> 22:23.211
What do you know about it?

22:25.169 --> 22:27.476
Not as much as I'm sure
we'd both like me to.

22:29.783 --> 22:30.871
How do you know about it?

22:33.743 --> 22:34.918
The admiral told me.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.837
Ah.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.361
So, that's why
I'm really here.

22:44.319 --> 22:47.322
There's no new information
about Hetty.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.019
He just wanted you to assess me.

22:49.193 --> 22:50.978
It was both.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.110
If I walk out?

22:53.284 --> 22:54.808
Well, Kilbride will probably
send you right back.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.027
I have cases.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.289
More important than this?

22:58.464 --> 23:00.335
And a partner who relies on me.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.990
To operate at the best
of your abilities.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.959
You find anything?

23:16.133 --> 23:17.874
Uh, well, I'm pretty sure
two of Mary Smith's neighbors

23:18.048 --> 23:18.875
are having an affair.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.921
Really?
Really.

23:21.095 --> 23:23.880
This woman goes for a jog
at the same time her neighbor

23:24.054 --> 23:25.578
three doors down
leaves the driveway,

23:25.708 --> 23:27.449
and it's like clockwork.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.495
She runs around the block,
and then up the alley

23:29.669 --> 23:30.931
into the back of the house.

23:31.105 --> 23:32.889
Oh, well, that gives
a new meaning

23:33.063 --> 23:34.238
to "love thy neighbor."

23:34.369 --> 23:36.676
Tell me about it.

23:36.850 --> 23:39.374
But, unfortunately,
no suspicious vehicles

23:39.548 --> 23:41.942
near her house around the time
of the kidnapping.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.335
Should we be checking
animal shelters?

23:44.510 --> 23:45.467
I mean, maybe they dumped
our Marine

23:45.641 --> 23:47.687
if he proved uncooperative.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.036
Yeah, they're already
on the lookout.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.691
Hey, how's everything going
over here?

23:51.865 --> 23:54.302
Not so great.
How about you?Nothing so far.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.912
Where's Sam?

23:56.086 --> 23:57.740
Uh, Sam was trying
to locate his father.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.176
Sounds like he wandered off
and got lost.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.831
Oh, no.
Does he have Alzheimer's?

24:01.962 --> 24:04.965
Mm, he didn't say,
but sounds like it.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.836
Man, that's tough.
Yeah.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.969
Uh, I'm gonna check in with
Shyla and the admiral.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.710
You guys let me know
if you have anything.Yeah, for sure.

24:12.712 --> 24:13.452
Oh, no.Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.366
Geez, I'm so sorry.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.542
No, you're okay.
I was in a hurry, too.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.108
Did you find Sam's dad?

24:18.282 --> 24:20.154
Yeah. Sam's on his way
to get him.

24:20.284 --> 24:21.242
But this is not good; I was just
going to alert the admiral.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.157
Alert him to what?

24:23.331 --> 24:24.593
I was wistfully looking for
lost and found pet postings,

24:24.767 --> 24:27.944
hoping we'd get lucky,
but of course not.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.903
Then I made the mistake
of checking the dark web.

24:30.077 --> 24:32.340
That's where I found this.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.951
Someone put a bounty on Boomer.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.998
Ten thousand dollars dead,
25 if he's taken alive.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.522
Well, you're right about
one thing, this isn't good.

24:40.696 --> 24:44.047
In fact it is very,
very bad.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.452
All right,
pull some of Cyber

24:57.583 --> 24:59.933
off of Callen's deep fakes.

25:00.107 --> 25:01.717
See if they can trace
who's posted this.

25:01.891 --> 25:04.241
And get Nancy Ross
at NSA to help.

25:04.415 --> 25:07.157
Tell her it's a personal
favor to me.
On it.

25:07.331 --> 25:08.681
Even if we found
who posted this,

25:08.811 --> 25:11.031
we still don't know exactly
who took Boomer.

25:11.205 --> 25:13.947
No. But hopefully we'll know
where they're taking him.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.992
All right. Let me know
if you find anything.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.299
Copy.
Okay.

25:19.561 --> 25:20.954
Hey, Kensi.Yeah.

25:21.128 --> 25:22.825
Take a look at this.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.350
We caught this about a block
away from Mary's residence.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.483
This guy only passes by
this camera once.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.616
I mean, could be nothing...

25:30.790 --> 25:32.182
Or it could be how they
transported Boomer

25:32.356 --> 25:34.054
out of the area without
raising any suspicion.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.838
You think it's worth
canvassing the neighborhood?

25:36.012 --> 25:37.710
I mean, if it's Boomer
in that shopping cart,

25:37.884 --> 25:40.626
they'd have transferred him to
a vehicle at some point, right?

25:40.800 --> 25:41.496
So if you can find
surveillance footage of that,

25:41.627 --> 25:43.193
we're back in business.

25:43.367 --> 25:44.281
All right, I'll get Rountree,
see what we can find.

25:44.412 --> 25:46.153
Good work.

25:47.807 --> 25:50.374
I remember doing puzzles
and memory games.

25:50.505 --> 25:55.728
Just flashes and slivers
here and there.

25:55.902 --> 25:59.819
It's hard to tell
what was real and...

25:59.993 --> 26:01.647
what I just imagined.

26:03.518 --> 26:06.434
Our memories can be
notoriously unreliable at times.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.959
I tried to use my
professional contacts

26:10.090 --> 26:11.961
to learn what I could,
but as you know

26:12.092 --> 26:15.704
from your Freedom of
Information Act request, uh...

26:15.878 --> 26:16.618
they threw this one
in the vault.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.838
What about Kilbride?

26:18.968 --> 26:21.101
He's just looking out for you
and the rest of the team.

26:21.275 --> 26:22.668
Sure about that?

26:22.842 --> 26:25.061
'Cause I'm the only one here.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.410
He's worried about you
most of all.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.761
Why is that?

26:30.937 --> 26:32.329
He doesn't want you melting down
when you realize

26:32.503 --> 26:35.071
you're the guinea pig
of your adoptive mother.

26:35.245 --> 26:37.030
His words, not mine, so...

26:43.645 --> 26:45.038
A little harsh.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.608
And what do you think?

26:52.915 --> 26:53.786
I think you deserve
to know the truth

26:53.916 --> 26:55.483
of your own existence.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.448
Hey, Kens.Hey. Anything?

27:04.579 --> 27:06.059
Not yet. Either people
aren't home,

27:06.233 --> 27:08.104
or they don't have
surveillance cameras.

27:08.278 --> 27:09.323
Okay. What about Rountree?

27:09.497 --> 27:12.500
It appears he scored
some cookies.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.197
Sorry, what?I'll call you right back.

27:14.371 --> 27:15.459
Seriously?

27:15.634 --> 27:18.593
Nice elderly old lady insisted.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.943
They're really good.
You want one?

27:21.117 --> 27:23.903
They do look good, but no,
I don't want a cookie.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.382
We're supposed to be finding out

27:25.556 --> 27:26.819
who kidnapped Master
Sergeant Hayes.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.908
Ah, did that, too.
Oh.

27:29.082 --> 27:32.433
Turns out my cookie mama
had a surveillance system.

27:32.607 --> 27:33.913
"Cookie mama"?

27:35.392 --> 27:36.872
More like cookie grandma.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.267
Let's go.

27:40.441 --> 27:41.747
They're really good.

27:51.582 --> 27:52.975
Show me your license,
puppy poacher.

27:55.543 --> 27:58.677
Oh, come on!
That's so lame.

27:58.851 --> 27:59.895
You can't even give me
a full plate?

28:00.069 --> 28:01.984
Didn't know God hated dogs.

28:02.158 --> 28:03.725
"But I've got thousands
of endangered species

28:03.856 --> 28:05.205
to worry about
thanks to your kind."

28:05.379 --> 28:06.641
Whose fault is that?

28:06.815 --> 28:08.425
I would think you could
multitask.

28:10.297 --> 28:13.430
No worries.
You do you.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.563
I got this.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.265
Hey.Hey.

28:22.439 --> 28:24.224
How we doing?

28:24.398 --> 28:26.748
Good. You?Solid.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.881
All right, so the guy
that owns this auto shop

28:29.011 --> 28:30.926
may have been the one who
grabbed our MWD.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.449
He the one who unloaded
the duct tape sleeping bag

28:32.623 --> 28:33.712
from his shopping cart?

28:33.886 --> 28:35.104
If you are transporting
a sedated canine,

28:35.235 --> 28:36.192
that would make sense.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.499
A canine that's worth 25K?

28:38.673 --> 28:39.935
He's not even best in show.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.676
Yeah, well, this dog
has cost them

28:41.850 --> 28:43.112
hundreds of millions of dollars

28:43.243 --> 28:44.679
of seized narcotics,
so it's no small wonder

28:44.853 --> 28:46.202
that they would put
a price tag on his head.

28:46.376 --> 28:47.856
So who are we looking for?

28:48.030 --> 28:51.991
We are looking for
a Joseph Jones.

28:52.121 --> 28:54.341
Oh, voted most like to
bury his loved ones alive?

28:54.471 --> 28:56.343
Yeah, probably.
This guy's got more mug shots

28:56.473 --> 28:58.345
than the Kardashians
have selfies.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.564
He's been in and out of trouble,
mostly in, since he was a minor.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.436
And his history of dognapping?

29:02.610 --> 29:04.481
Actually, this one's a first,
but he's a freelancer

29:04.655 --> 29:06.919
who seems to be willing
to do anything for money.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.572
Well, maybe that's a good thing.
I mean, if it's all about money,

29:08.703 --> 29:10.618
maybe he won't risk his life
over a dog.

29:10.792 --> 29:11.619
Well, he might
risk it if he knows

29:11.793 --> 29:13.316
he's facing some serious
jail time.

29:13.490 --> 29:14.491
True.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.102
We, uh... we got backup?

29:16.276 --> 29:18.060
Yeah. You two.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.540
L.A. Sheriff's assisted
walking a search warrant

29:19.714 --> 29:22.195
downtown as we speak.
Let's go.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.379
Sitrep.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.598
Agents Kensi, Namazi
and Rountree are outside

29:34.729 --> 29:36.209
the suspect's workplace.

29:36.383 --> 29:38.211
Wish you were with them?

29:38.385 --> 29:39.952
Sometimes.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.780
Me, too.

29:41.954 --> 29:44.086
They're good to go
on their call.

29:47.307 --> 29:49.309
You see anything?

29:49.483 --> 29:51.267
No movement.

29:51.398 --> 29:53.182
KENSI
Got it. I'm moving in the back.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.190
Fatima, Rountree,
what's your status?

30:01.321 --> 30:02.104
We're at the front gate.

30:03.323 --> 30:04.846
It's locked.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.935
Copy that. Hold your position.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.828
I got eyes on the
suspected vehicle.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.917
I'm moving in.

30:32.091 --> 30:34.223
Joseph Jones?

30:34.397 --> 30:37.748
Federal agents.
We just need to speak with you.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.099
Come out with your hands
where we can see them.

30:47.715 --> 30:48.542
What's happening?

30:48.716 --> 30:50.370
Agent Blye, Agent Namazi?

30:50.544 --> 30:52.894
Hang on.Hang on?

30:53.068 --> 30:55.157
You see what I deal
with? Hang on.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.965
Thanks.

31:20.139 --> 31:22.750
No problem.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.709
Have I hung on long
enough, Agent Namazi?

31:25.884 --> 31:28.190
Uh, yes sir.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.627
Sorry, Admiral. Uh, we had
an uncooperative suspect,

31:30.801 --> 31:31.977
but we're good now.

31:32.151 --> 31:33.195
And our master sergeant?

31:33.369 --> 31:34.675
We're all clear back there.

31:34.849 --> 31:37.243
Any sign of our MWD?No.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.071
Fatima.

31:39.201 --> 31:41.160
Can you...Yeah. Got it.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.081
Agent Blye?

31:52.519 --> 31:54.173
He's not here.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.752
Where's the dog?What dog?

32:08.883 --> 32:10.232
The dog you
kidnapped.

32:10.406 --> 32:12.060
Why would I kidnap a dog?I don't know.

32:12.234 --> 32:13.888
Why'd you do half the stupid
things you got arrested for?

32:14.062 --> 32:15.542
We have evidence of you

32:15.672 --> 32:17.022
putting a sleeping bag
into the back of your SUV.

32:17.196 --> 32:18.937
Is that a crime?

32:19.111 --> 32:20.677
If there's an abducted
canine inside.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.114
Inside what?
Now I'm confused.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.290
Oh, you're confused?
Let me explain it.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.335
You attacked a federal
law enforcement agent.

32:26.466 --> 32:27.554
That's a big no-no,
especially for somebody

32:27.684 --> 32:29.164
with a record like you.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.036
But it can get a lot worse.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.733
Because that dog
that you kidnapped

32:32.907 --> 32:34.561
is a Marine master sergeant,

32:34.691 --> 32:36.867
so if anything happens to him
you can be charged

32:37.042 --> 32:39.479
as if he were a human being.
That means you're looking at

32:39.653 --> 32:41.916
a felony murder charge if we
don't find him alive and well.

32:43.265 --> 32:46.007
I think you're making that up.Am I?

32:46.138 --> 32:47.704
You better hope we find that dog

32:47.878 --> 32:49.228
safe and sound at your house.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.360
You're not going to find
anything there.

32:51.534 --> 32:52.709
Why not?

32:52.840 --> 32:54.233
Because I told you

32:54.407 --> 32:56.061
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.888
Oh, my God.You break into my shop
with guns.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.239
I was just trying
to protect myself.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.719
How did you get paid?I didn't.

33:02.893 --> 33:04.199
You better stop playing games
or I'm gonna light that torch

33:04.373 --> 33:05.635
and turn it on you.

33:05.809 --> 33:06.985
Did you just threaten me?

33:07.159 --> 33:08.638
She just threatened me.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.075
You heard it.Why don't you get some air.

33:10.249 --> 33:13.078
I got this.It's your lucky day, buddy.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.951
Your partner's a little
high-strung.

33:17.082 --> 33:17.952
Shut up!

33:18.083 --> 33:20.172
That's just rude.

33:21.912 --> 33:24.132
Hey, Shyla, you find anything
useful on this guy yet?

33:24.306 --> 33:25.655
I see no signs of
any money transfers

33:25.829 --> 33:27.222
into his bank account.

33:27.396 --> 33:28.876
Yeah, well, I'm sure
it was a cash deal.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.921
I have his recent cell activity

33:31.096 --> 33:32.184
but unless we know
exactly where he was going,

33:32.314 --> 33:33.837
it's a bit of a
wild goose chase.

33:33.968 --> 33:35.883
Well, good thing
this warrant covers

33:36.057 --> 33:39.060
any and all vehicles
on the location.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.889
I am now accessing
the SUV's GPS

33:42.063 --> 33:43.238
to see where it's been lately.

33:43.412 --> 33:45.414
That could certainly help.

33:45.545 --> 33:46.937
Any word from Rountree?

33:47.112 --> 33:49.288
He's searching Joseph Jones'
house now.

33:49.418 --> 33:51.551
He's recovered several weapons,
drugs and cash.

33:51.725 --> 33:54.206
But still no sign of our
missing master sergeant.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.859
Wait, how much cash
did he recover?

33:55.990 --> 33:57.644
'Cause that might be the bounty
that Jones received.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.298
Also, we may be able
to pull prints off of it.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.126
I'll have him use
some ninhydrin spray

34:01.300 --> 34:02.562
to see if he can develop
any prints in the field.

34:02.736 --> 34:03.693
Awesome. Thank you.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.608
Okay, I'm done here.

34:05.782 --> 34:07.915
I'm uploading the SUV's computer
diagnostics to you now.

34:08.089 --> 34:10.439
Let's see where Jones has been
after grabbing Boomer.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.050
I'm on it.

34:13.877 --> 34:15.009
You find anything else,
Agent Rountree?

34:15.140 --> 34:16.750
Oh, yeah.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.882
This is definitely our guy.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.494
Found evidence that
he bought a dog muzzle.

34:21.668 --> 34:25.324
Which is hard to explain,
because he doesn't own a dog.

34:25.498 --> 34:27.456
Too bad he's not talking.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.284
Well, maybe he won't have to.

34:33.897 --> 34:36.030
Yeah, boom.
We got some good prints.

34:36.204 --> 34:38.598
Let's just hope they're not
from a random bank teller.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.817
The prints on the money
belong to a lowlife named

34:40.948 --> 34:43.037
Brian "Buster" Miller.

34:43.211 --> 34:44.691
Doesn't seem like the brains
of any operations.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.562
My guess is he's muscle.

34:46.736 --> 34:48.695
His home address
is out in Barstow.

34:48.825 --> 34:50.088
Any known associates?

34:50.262 --> 34:52.133
Oh, crap.What is it?

34:52.307 --> 34:53.961
He's been charged
and convicted twice

34:54.135 --> 34:56.311
under penal code
animal cruelty.

34:56.485 --> 34:58.792
Both times it was knocked down
to a misdemeanor.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.489
Okay, when you say
animal cruelty...

35:00.620 --> 35:02.143
He was linked to
a dogfighting ring.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.102
Okay, definitely check
his known associates,

35:04.276 --> 35:06.016
especially those with ties
to dogfighting.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.062
Already on it.Then cross-reference them

35:08.236 --> 35:11.065
with the areas Jones was in
in the SUV 12 hours ago or so.

35:11.239 --> 35:13.067
Chances are he delivered the dog
and received the money

35:13.198 --> 35:14.808
in the same location.

35:14.982 --> 35:17.854
Also, get Rountree back here
and check Callen's status.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.856
We might need some help
before this is over.

35:19.987 --> 35:21.771
Copy that.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.513
The idea of repressed memories
is a controversial one

35:24.687 --> 35:26.776
to say the least,
but if you keep an open mind--

35:26.950 --> 35:28.387
no pun intended--

35:28.561 --> 35:30.215
and a healthy skepticism,

35:30.389 --> 35:32.565
there might be something worth
exploring, in your case.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.132
Is everything all right?

35:34.306 --> 35:36.003
Unfortunately, no.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.526
You need to go?

35:37.657 --> 35:38.745
I should.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.790
Duty calls.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.446
So...

35:44.620 --> 35:47.101
you can help me remember
things I've forgotten?

35:48.189 --> 35:50.017
I can certainly try.

35:50.191 --> 35:54.108
But give it some
serious thought first.

35:54.282 --> 35:57.242
Some memories are
forgotten for a reason.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.433
Everything okay?

36:14.607 --> 36:17.566
Yeah, yeah.
It's just my sister.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.351
Oh, how's she doing?

36:19.525 --> 36:22.397
She's good.
She just worries about me.

36:24.225 --> 36:26.227
Has she, uh, spoken to anyone

36:26.401 --> 36:29.578
since what happened
to you two?

36:29.709 --> 36:30.840
Like a counselor?

36:32.886 --> 36:34.627
I don't think so.

36:34.801 --> 36:38.370
Mm. Well, maybe she should.

36:38.544 --> 36:40.981
You don't want her
carrying that around.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.375
Maybe if, you know,

36:43.505 --> 36:44.898
she knew you were
talking to someone,

36:45.072 --> 36:47.814
She'd feel more
comfortable doing it.

36:49.816 --> 36:51.078
What's up, Shyla?

36:51.252 --> 36:53.036
Brian Miller.
He's a known member

36:53.167 --> 36:54.386
of the Aryan prison gang

36:54.516 --> 36:57.215
the Ghost Soldiers,
run by a real charmer

36:57.389 --> 36:59.042
named Nick Reed.

36:59.173 --> 37:01.436
The gang's been taking big risks
and making big coin

37:01.610 --> 37:03.525
running drugs for the cartels.

37:03.699 --> 37:06.528
Until Sergeant Smith
and Master Sergeant Hayes

37:06.702 --> 37:08.400
caused several large shipments
to be seized.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.228
That explains why
they targeted Boomer.

37:10.402 --> 37:11.751
There's something else.

37:11.925 --> 37:13.753
This gang is into
a lot of nasty things,

37:13.927 --> 37:15.537
including dogfights.

37:15.711 --> 37:16.973
They paid to have
Boomer kidnapped

37:17.104 --> 37:19.062
to get him off the streets,

37:19.193 --> 37:21.195
but really,
they wanted him alive...

37:21.326 --> 37:22.762
Don't even say it.

37:28.550 --> 37:31.292
Any idea how many
we're dealing with?

37:31.423 --> 37:33.294
No, but Kilbride has
a react team on standby.

37:33.425 --> 37:34.948
Okay, whoever's in there is
most likely gonna be armed

37:35.122 --> 37:36.341
and won't hesitate
to fight back,

37:36.515 --> 37:37.864
so you got to be extra sharp
and be careful.

37:37.994 --> 37:40.519
Copy that.All right, Callen...

37:40.649 --> 37:42.172
how do you feel
about us luring them out?

37:42.347 --> 37:43.348
Might give us an idea
of how many we're dealing with.

37:43.522 --> 37:44.827
You got a plan?

38:06.371 --> 38:08.808
What the hell, lady?!Oh, my gosh.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.549
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.

38:10.679 --> 38:12.115
What just happened?You backed into my truck.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.508
What? Oh...

38:13.682 --> 38:14.509
Fatima, Rountree,
you're good to go.

38:14.683 --> 38:16.250
Moving in.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.034
Oh, no. Oh, no. Okay,
Maybe we should call the police.

38:18.208 --> 38:18.731
I'm so sorry. But I...No. No!

38:18.905 --> 38:20.907
It was my fault.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.735
I should call the police.You don't need to
call the police.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.004
Just pull your car forward.

38:31.178 --> 38:33.136
I can't pull the car forward
until the police arrive.

38:33.267 --> 38:34.616
You don't need to
call the police!Okay.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.927
What's going on
in there, Fatima?

38:41.101 --> 38:43.364
No joy yet.

38:50.763 --> 38:52.330
Hands up! Way up.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.636
Federal agents. Do it.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.595
We got two here.

38:58.510 --> 38:59.989
Don't even think about it.
We got trouble.

39:00.163 --> 39:01.295
Get out of the car.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.601
I-I really don't think
that I should.

39:02.775 --> 39:03.819
Get out of the damn car, lady!

39:03.993 --> 39:05.473
Get out of the car!

39:05.647 --> 39:06.735
Maybe we should just
exchange information.

39:14.613 --> 39:16.179
Federal agents!
Drop your weapons.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.225
Do as he says now.

39:18.399 --> 39:19.879
If there was ever a time
to stop making bad decisions,

39:20.053 --> 39:21.576
this would be it.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.230
Down.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.102
Put it down.

39:26.233 --> 39:27.756
Hands up.On your knees.

39:32.674 --> 39:33.849
Sitrep?

39:34.023 --> 39:35.242
Four suspects apprehended.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.244
Drugs and weapons
found on scene.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.159
And our master sergeant?

39:43.206 --> 39:44.469
We're gonna need
Animal Control down here.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.441
Master Sergeant Boomer Hayes?

40:02.051 --> 40:04.140
Think we found him.

40:04.271 --> 40:05.490
You ready to go home, Marine?

40:18.459 --> 40:19.721
I know, buddy. She's coming.

40:19.895 --> 40:21.288
Boomer!Who's that?

40:21.462 --> 40:25.074
Boomer, Boomer, hi!

40:25.248 --> 40:26.989
Look at you.
Are you all right?

40:27.163 --> 40:28.077
We can arrange for a vet
to look over him if you'd like.

40:28.251 --> 40:30.471
Oh, no, no, no.
He looks so good.

40:30.602 --> 40:34.954
He looks good. I'll have my
vet look at him tomorrow.

40:35.128 --> 40:37.913
Oh, thank you so much.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.741
I know people think
it's kind of stupid

40:39.915 --> 40:41.569
how much we bond
with these furry guys.

40:41.743 --> 40:42.875
I don't think
it's stupid at all.

40:43.049 --> 40:44.485
I think it's really special.

40:44.616 --> 40:47.706
In fact, I married
my furry partner.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.447
Though he's more of a mutt.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.843
It's an inside joke.
I'm talking about my husband.

40:59.848 --> 41:02.590
Hey, do you... do you think
I could talk to Nate

41:02.764 --> 41:04.200
about what happened
to me and Jordyn?

41:04.331 --> 41:06.551
Absolutely.

41:06.725 --> 41:08.901
Yeah, that's... that's
what he's there for.

41:09.075 --> 41:10.816
Wouldn't hurt.

41:10.990 --> 41:12.731
Rountree.

41:12.905 --> 41:14.515
You good?Yeah, I'm good.

41:14.646 --> 41:16.299
That was a nice tackle.Thanks.

41:16.430 --> 41:18.084
You both did well today.

41:18.214 --> 41:20.347
On all fronts.Thanks, Callen.

41:26.309 --> 41:27.876
How'd you make out
with your father?

41:28.007 --> 41:30.662
I heard he had, uh,
an incident today.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.316
I found him.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.362
He, uh...

41:37.059 --> 41:39.801
He went to the store,
forgot he drove and walked home.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.324
Got turned around.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.501
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

41:45.372 --> 41:46.460
Sometimes, even when we win

41:46.591 --> 41:49.811
it doesn't feel like it.

41:49.985 --> 41:52.379
We keep swinging.

41:52.553 --> 41:55.556
Mm-hmm.

41:55.687 --> 41:57.036
Hey, you think
I ought to get a dog?

41:58.341 --> 42:00.735
Absolutely not.

42:00.909 --> 42:02.258
Why?

42:02.432 --> 42:03.999
You're not a dog person.

42:04.173 --> 42:05.479
How do you know
I'm not a dog person?

42:05.610 --> 42:07.655
Have you ever owned a dog?

42:07.829 --> 42:10.266
You don't have to
have a dog to be a dog person.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.790
Pretty sure you do.Okay,

42:11.964 --> 42:13.356
so the minute I get a dog,
I'll be a dog person.

42:13.531 --> 42:14.967
Nope. Start small.

42:15.141 --> 42:17.622
A cat? No.

42:17.796 --> 42:19.145
I am not a cat person.

42:19.319 --> 42:20.973
I'm thinking smaller.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.366
Goldfish.
Maybe some sea monkeys.

42:23.541 --> 42:24.542
Pet rock.

42:24.716 --> 42:26.282
You know, baby steps, G.

42:26.413 --> 42:27.719
Baby steps.

42:27.849 --> 42:29.808
Yeah, you're funny.

42:32.985 --> 42:36.118
and TOYOTA.
