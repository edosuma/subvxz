WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:06.093
<i>Dwayne had presented
his final trade offer</i>

00:06.093 --> 00:07.268
<i>to the prime minister,</i>

00:07.268 --> 00:09.313
and we were awaiting
her decision,

00:09.313 --> 00:11.881
like two baby birds
waiting for their mother

00:11.881 --> 00:14.579
to regurgitate a coffee deal
into their mouths.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.277
Randall,
you're making me nervous.

00:16.277 --> 00:19.019
Come on.
- Yeah.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.891
This coffee is amazing.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.415
I heard it was good, but damn.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.852
Fingers crossed she ends up
biting on your trade deal,

00:26.852 --> 00:28.767
because I haven't even had time
to look at the files

00:28.767 --> 00:29.986
that Taft gave me.

00:29.986 --> 00:32.032
I forgot my glasses.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.859
Good morning, Dwayne.
- Morning, Bibi.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.861
Mm-hmm.

00:37.167 --> 00:40.431
So what do we do
if your plan doesn't work?

00:40.431 --> 00:42.433
Well, whatever she chooses,
I'll live with it.

00:42.433 --> 00:45.306
I stepped into the arena,
and I gave it everything I had.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.742
I wish I had
your level of zen.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.526
Honestly, Randall,
this situation is nothing

00:48.526 --> 00:49.875
compared to some
of the other things

00:49.875 --> 00:51.529
I've been through.

00:51.529 --> 00:53.531
<i>Like back in 2000,
when I hosted</i>

00:53.531 --> 00:55.446
<i>"Saturday Night Live"
for the first time.</i>

00:55.446 --> 00:57.274
<i>Doing comedy on live TV</i>

00:57.274 --> 00:58.710
<i>in front of millions
of people...</i>

00:58.710 --> 01:00.016
Bah! Bah! Bah!

01:00.016 --> 01:02.062
Bah!

01:02.062 --> 01:04.281
<i>Now that will test your zen.</i>

01:04.281 --> 01:05.717
<i>Post-show, I was excited</i>

01:05.717 --> 01:07.719
<i>to hear what Vince
and the boys thought.</i>

01:07.719 --> 01:09.721
<i>They had joined me for a gag
during my monologue,</i>

01:09.721 --> 01:11.636
<i>and then they watched the rest
of the show backstage.</i>

01:11.636 --> 01:14.683
They finally smell
what The Rock is cooking.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.250
- I improv'd that.
- Improv'd?

01:16.250 --> 01:17.903
Look at Big Head
with the lingo.

01:19.427 --> 01:22.647
Oh, uh, are the grapes
for everyone?

01:22.647 --> 01:24.519
Yeah, go for it, Mick.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.911
It was all great, Dwayne.

01:25.911 --> 01:28.479
Millions of non-wrestling fans
just watched

01:28.479 --> 01:31.526
an hour and a half long
advertisement for the WWF.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.354
What could be better?

01:33.354 --> 01:35.095
I know.
And that's amazing.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.835
I just meant, was I any good?

01:36.835 --> 01:38.315
Isn't that what I just said?

01:38.315 --> 01:39.925
Neediness is so unattractive.

01:39.925 --> 01:43.233
What they mean to say is,
we love you very much,

01:43.233 --> 01:44.408
and we think you're handsome.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.106
Thank you, man.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.063
Come on, dude.
You were great.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.282
Thanks, brother.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.500
<i>"SNL" was
an amazing experience,</i>

01:49.500 --> 01:51.285
<i>and I was still buzzing
the next day.</i>

01:51.285 --> 01:53.330
And then after the show,
we all went to this bar,

01:53.330 --> 01:55.463
and Paul Simon
and Paul Shaffer showed up.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.943
So much talent
in such small bodies.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.249
Was Garfunkel there?

01:59.249 --> 02:00.685
I didn't see Garfunkel, no.

02:00.685 --> 02:01.817
I hope he's OK.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.775
Hey, and I got
Chris Kattan's number.

02:03.775 --> 02:06.256
Oh, send him a message
and tell him we're big fans.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.953
- Why don't you do it?
- Me?

02:07.953 --> 02:09.129
- Yeah.
- I'll do it.

02:09.129 --> 02:13.045
- Yeah.
- OK, who is Chris Catman?

02:13.045 --> 02:14.612
Oh, Mom, you know.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.745
He's the one who does
all the characters.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.790
You were so funny
on the show, babe.

02:18.790 --> 02:19.922
Oh, thank you.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.706
It felt so good
to be on that stage,

02:21.706 --> 02:24.056
holding my own
with these comedy legends.

02:24.056 --> 02:25.797
You know, I think

02:25.797 --> 02:27.451
I can really do
this acting thing.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.671
Hey, I'm all in on you
doing a Mr. Peepers movie.

02:29.671 --> 02:30.846
Uh, no.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.282
Those apples were
too tough on my teeth.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.023
But something like that.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.372
My phone's been going nuts

02:35.372 --> 02:37.374
with people calling
to congratulate me,

02:37.374 --> 02:39.115
and not just
from friends, either.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.335
I've got, like, 25 voice mails
from random numbers.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.727
Well, why don't you
let me help you?

02:42.727 --> 02:44.164
I'll listen to them
and follow up.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.035
- Really?
- I'm an amazing partner.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.210
What can I say?

02:47.210 --> 02:49.212
Plus, you have
so much on your plate

02:49.212 --> 02:50.257
with WrestleMania coming up.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.301
Thanks, babe.

02:51.301 --> 02:52.824
How is this my life--

02:52.824 --> 02:55.175
hosting "SNL,"
headlining WrestleMania?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.089
Not to mention
buying our first house.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.221
The offer got accepted?

02:58.221 --> 02:59.614
Mm-hmm.
Closing in a couple days.

02:59.614 --> 03:02.007
Oh, that's amazing.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.095
Oh, honey?

03:03.095 --> 03:04.619
Chris Kattan seems upset

03:04.619 --> 03:06.708
that Mom didn't know
who he was.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.623
I thought he was the fat one.

03:10.755 --> 03:13.932
<i>Couple of weeks later,
I got the house.</i>

03:13.932 --> 03:15.847
Oh, my gosh, honey!

03:15.847 --> 03:17.066
You like it?

03:17.066 --> 03:18.328
It's beautiful.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.895
Sunken living room.

03:19.895 --> 03:22.289
Kind of reminds me of our
old place back in Hawaii.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.507
Yeah, I thought so too.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.292
Oh, you did good, Dewey.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.250
I'm glad you like it.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.861
These are for you.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.863
You want me to find a place
for you to hang your keys?

03:31.863 --> 03:33.517
You need a hook
by the front door.

03:33.517 --> 03:36.259
- No. It's yours.
- What's mine?

03:36.259 --> 03:38.348
He's giving you
a set of keys, babe.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.132
I'm giving you
<i>the</i> set of keys.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.047
OK. Now I don't follow.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.179
I think he's doing comedy.

03:43.179 --> 03:45.225
No.

03:45.225 --> 03:50.839
I'm giving you the keys
because this is your house.

03:50.839 --> 03:51.927
You're joking.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.537
No, I am not.

03:53.537 --> 03:57.062
- You bought us a house?
- I promised you I would.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.368
I don't know what to say.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.935
Oh, what?

03:59.935 --> 04:01.371
There's more.

04:01.371 --> 04:03.330
There is not more.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.506
Oh, that's nice.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.203
You hired Bruno
to be your valet.

04:07.203 --> 04:09.901
No, Dad,
he's parking your truck.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.816
- My truck?
- The truck is yours too.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.341
The house, the truck,
all of it.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.429
It's all yours.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.126
Oh, Dewey.

04:17.126 --> 04:18.388
<i>Let me tell you,</i>

04:18.388 --> 04:19.998
<i>that was a moment
I'll never forget.</i>

04:19.998 --> 04:21.913
Oh, son, thank you!

04:23.001 --> 04:25.265
Hey, Bruno,
how you getting home?

04:29.138 --> 04:31.227
<i>I always told my parents
I'd buy them</i>

04:31.227 --> 04:32.533
<i>their very first house,
and man,</i>

04:32.533 --> 04:34.448
<i>I was so happy
to make good on that promise.</i>

04:34.448 --> 04:36.972
I'm having a hard time
believing all this, son.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.843
I'm gonna need to see
some paperwork.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.454
My whole life,
you've been moving

04:40.454 --> 04:42.630
from place to place,
doing everything you could

04:42.630 --> 04:43.892
to provide for the family.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.067
It's about time
you had somewhere

04:45.067 --> 04:46.634
where you can feel settled.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.157
But Dewey, this is--

04:48.157 --> 04:51.378
Mom, this is a dream
come true for me.

04:51.378 --> 04:55.164
Everything I've gone through,
from getting injured at Miami,

04:55.164 --> 04:57.035
getting cut from the CFL,

04:57.035 --> 04:59.821
almost getting
run out of the WWF,

04:59.821 --> 05:02.040
what kept me going
was the promise

05:02.040 --> 05:04.739
of buying you a house.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.262
When I make it to the NFL,

05:06.262 --> 05:07.829
we're never gonna have to worry
about money again.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.135
The first thing I'm gonna do
when I get drafted to the NFL

05:10.135 --> 05:11.267
is buy you a house.

05:11.267 --> 05:12.486
<i>That TV's just the beginning.</i>

05:12.486 --> 05:13.965
In a couple years,
it's gonna be

05:13.965 --> 05:16.228
a three-bedroom ranch house
in that box.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.796
You know, I actually remember
the first time

05:18.796 --> 05:20.102
I heard you mention that.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.322
It almost broke my heart.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.411
<i>I deposited that money
three days ago.</i>

05:24.411 --> 05:26.500
I don't understand why it's
not in our account yet.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.284
<i>- I'm sure you're fine.</i>
- You're sure it's fine?

05:28.284 --> 05:29.720
Well, come and have a look
in my refrigerator,

05:29.720 --> 05:30.765
and you tell me it's fine.

05:30.765 --> 05:31.940
I need that money
for groceries.

05:33.289 --> 05:34.508
Can you just hold on
for one second, please?

05:34.508 --> 05:35.900
I'll be right back.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.122
OK.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.559
Hi, is this the bank?

05:42.559 --> 05:43.995
I'm sorry. Who's this?

05:43.995 --> 05:45.954
I'm her son.
I need to be quick.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.216
She's just answering the door.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.652
Young man,
are you in trouble?

05:48.652 --> 05:51.046
Say "Chesapeake"
if you can't talk right now.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.395
<i>I'm fine.</i>

05:52.395 --> 05:54.919
Listen, I would like
to get a loan.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.878
I want to buy my mom a house.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.140
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

05:58.140 --> 05:59.794
I'll pay you back
as soon as I can.

05:59.794 --> 06:02.013
I just want it
to be a surprise,

06:02.013 --> 06:03.711
so please don't tell her.

06:03.711 --> 06:04.973
OK, gotta go. Bye.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.583
Don't forget.

06:10.152 --> 06:13.938
This is why
you get into banking.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.940
I didn't know you heard that.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.073
And never for a second
did I ever think

06:18.073 --> 06:19.379
it wasn't gonna happen.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.341
My belt! My tag team belt!

06:25.341 --> 06:28.779
Babe, he's got Peter's belt
and my tag team belt.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.477
Come on, Mom.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.043
You gotta see
the rest of the house.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.828
There's some nice surprises.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.396
What are
these sparkling purses

06:36.396 --> 06:39.660
that look like animals
and fruit?

06:39.660 --> 06:40.922
Judith Leibers?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.663
You got Judith Leiber purses?

06:42.663 --> 06:45.056
<i>You</i> got
Judith Leiber purses.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.406
Ooh.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.103
Rocky, don't touch those!

06:48.103 --> 06:50.888
Oh, come to Mama, my pretties.

06:53.108 --> 06:55.545
We've come a long way,
haven't we?

06:55.545 --> 06:57.199
You mean from when Dewey
used to rock

06:57.199 --> 06:59.375
that turtleneck and fanny pack?

07:00.507 --> 07:01.986
I think she was
talking about the time

07:01.986 --> 07:03.118
you dyed your hair blonde.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.119
- Oh.
- Ah.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.381
Well, it was platinum.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.514
Your head looked
like dirty snow.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.864
It was platinum.

07:09.864 --> 07:11.474
No, I'm talking
about low points,

07:11.474 --> 07:13.128
like when I got to Tennessee
and realized

07:13.128 --> 07:14.912
Rocky hadn't found us
anywhere to live.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.392
You know what's funny?

07:16.392 --> 07:18.481
My lowest point was
also in a car with Dad.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.483
Y'all just gonna
gang up on me now?

07:20.483 --> 07:22.485
No, you actually
helped me out, Pops.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.182
It was after I got cut
from the CFL

07:24.182 --> 07:25.401
and you took me back to Tampa.

07:25.401 --> 07:28.273
Only had 7 bucks to my name.

07:28.273 --> 07:31.973
Nothing was worse
than the way we left Hawaii.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.757
<i>My grandmother was right.</i>

07:33.757 --> 07:35.977
<i>Leaving Hawaii
was our low point.</i>

07:35.977 --> 07:37.587
<i>I don't understand.</i>

07:37.587 --> 07:39.633
How did we not make more
of a profit off that last show?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.548
The Peter tribute
was a packed house.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.854
The arena and wrestlers
we booked were not cheap.

07:43.854 --> 07:46.727
Well, the good news is,
the show was a success.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.730
Plenty for us to build off of.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.775
<i>You'll remember
that a year before,</i>

07:51.775 --> 07:53.995
<i>my grandmother beat the FBI's
extortion case</i>

07:53.995 --> 07:55.126
<i>that was against her.</i>

07:55.126 --> 07:56.563
I love the jury.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.348
I am a lady innocent,
and they saw that.

07:59.348 --> 08:02.699
Oh, and FBI, kill yourselves.

08:04.788 --> 08:09.010
We'll find something on her,
and she'll go down.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.012
<i>And it appeared
they had found something.</i>

08:11.012 --> 08:12.230
Mom, did you hear
what I said?

08:12.230 --> 08:13.536
- Hmm?
- We gotta figure out

08:13.536 --> 08:15.538
the next steps
for our promotion.

08:15.538 --> 08:18.846
We need to start
turning a profit.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.630
Lia?

08:20.630 --> 08:22.545
Let's talk about this
another time.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.547
<i>Never satisfied
at being defeated,</i>

08:24.547 --> 08:26.506
<i>the FBI did
some digging around</i>

08:26.506 --> 08:27.855
<i>and discovered
that my grandmother</i>

08:27.855 --> 08:29.552
<i>was an illegal U.S. citizen.</i>

08:29.552 --> 08:31.511
<i>They were like
a dog with a bone.</i>

08:31.511 --> 08:33.556
<i>She'd beaten
those extortion charges,</i>

08:33.556 --> 08:35.689
<i>but she was less confident
this time around,</i>

08:35.689 --> 08:38.082
<i>not that she'd ever let them
know that.</i>

08:44.219 --> 08:46.221
<i>My mom and dad had no idea</i>

08:46.221 --> 08:48.136
<i>what my grandmother was
dealing with,</i>

08:48.136 --> 08:49.572
<i>so they kept their focus
on making</i>

08:49.572 --> 08:51.400
<i>the wrestling promotion profitable.</i>

08:51.400 --> 08:52.706
This is
what we should be doing, Rocky,

08:52.706 --> 08:54.316
an annual event.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.405
How is WrestleMania
an annual event?

08:56.405 --> 08:57.798
They've only done it twice.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.364
When you put Roman numerals
after something,

08:59.364 --> 09:00.409
you don't stop at two.

09:00.409 --> 09:01.889
There's a psychology behind it.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.717
Since what do you know
about psychology, Mom?

09:03.717 --> 09:05.675
Honey, that's what
being a mom is--

09:05.675 --> 09:08.896
manipulating your family...
with love.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.899
We should make the Peter Maivia
tribute our annual thing.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.465
I love it.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.119
And it's the type of thing
that'll get your mom excited.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.251
I hope so.

09:16.251 --> 09:17.295
She hasn't been liking anything

09:17.295 --> 09:19.167
we've been pitching her recently.

09:25.956 --> 09:26.957
Hi, Rocky.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.350
Kit, hey.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.308
Now is not the best time.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.049
We're having a little
creative meeting in here.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.008
Juices are flowing.
- I get it.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.139
You know, I was in the room

09:35.139 --> 09:37.054
when the Croissan'wich
was invented.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.447
Don't want
to interrupt the flow.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.275
Just want to bring
to your attention

09:40.275 --> 09:42.843
that the rent is
a few weeks late.

09:46.498 --> 09:49.240
Funny enough, that is exactly
what this meeting is about.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.807
Oh. Oh, good.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.635
'Cause it's been late
a few times, so--

09:52.635 --> 09:54.637
The check is
practically in the mail.

09:54.637 --> 09:55.812
Oh, well, you don't
have to mail it.

09:55.812 --> 09:56.944
I've got a slot in my door.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.641
You got it.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.338
- Well, I just--
- God bless.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.734
<i>With the family's financial
well-being on the line,</i>

10:04.734 --> 10:05.953
<i>my parents went all out
for their big pitch.</i>

10:05.953 --> 10:07.302
It'll be like WrestleMania

10:07.302 --> 10:09.391
but with a real reason
behind it.

10:09.391 --> 10:12.524
An annual tribute
to the High Chief.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.310
<i>But my grandmother had
the FBI on her mind.</i>

10:15.310 --> 10:17.529
And then those champions
come together to fight

10:17.529 --> 10:19.009
for the ultimate champion.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.620
It's gonna be amazing, Mom.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.838
We can get
all the boys involved,

10:21.838 --> 10:23.535
and they'd love to do that
for Dad.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.415
Mom?

10:33.415 --> 10:35.112
What do you think?

10:35.112 --> 10:37.854
I have a concern
you should know about.

10:40.988 --> 10:44.818
How did I get so lucky to have
such a brilliant family?

10:47.429 --> 10:49.779
Oh, Dewey, go easy
on the calamari, huh?

10:49.779 --> 10:50.824
I'm trying to get
some leg ones

10:50.824 --> 10:52.434
before Grandma gets them all.

10:52.434 --> 10:53.914
I love the idea.

10:53.914 --> 10:57.569
And High Chief is never shy
about being celebrated.

10:57.569 --> 10:58.788
Oh, I'm so glad.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.268
I can make some calls
to the mainland,

11:00.268 --> 11:01.748
see who's around.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.575
<i>My grandmother didn't have
the heart to tell us</i>

11:03.575 --> 11:05.534
<i>about her issues with the FBI.</i>

11:05.534 --> 11:08.145
<i>She knew none of my parents'
plans would ever happen,</i>

11:08.145 --> 11:10.713
<i>but she wanted us
to have this night</i>

11:10.713 --> 11:12.802
<i>to dream about what could be.</i>

11:12.802 --> 11:14.586
<i>And man, we left on a high.</i>

11:14.586 --> 11:15.849
<i>So I'll talk to the guys.</i>

11:15.849 --> 11:17.720
You get started working
on the story lines.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.026
Lia could coordinate
the venues--

11:19.026 --> 11:20.723
And I'll finish
this leftover calamari.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.377
Son, you gotta chill
on the squid.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.900
Wait, that's squid?

11:23.900 --> 11:27.295
I'm gonna put on a pot
of coffee and get started.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.426
What's this?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.169
Oh, my God.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.083
Rocky.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.868
<i>Eviction notice.</i>

11:34.868 --> 11:37.609
<i>We had 24 hours
to get our stuff and go.</i>

11:37.609 --> 11:40.090
Let me talk to the landlord.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.265
Kit!

11:44.747 --> 11:45.922
Hey, Rocky.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.750
Kit, you said
we can have an extension.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.099
What's going on?

11:49.099 --> 11:51.841
I said that so you wouldn't
be disappointed.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.800
I'm terrible
with confrontation.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.845
So that's it?
We're evicted?

11:55.845 --> 11:58.326
Well, you see...

11:58.326 --> 11:59.457
yes.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.769
<i>No, I can't argue
with that, Mom.</i>

12:06.769 --> 12:08.989
That eviction was
our low point.

12:08.989 --> 12:12.862
Maybe yours, but you only got
evicted from your house.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.647
They evicted me
from the whole damn country.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.780
<i>A few years later,
I found a little loophole</i>

12:17.780 --> 12:19.695
<i>and found out my grandmother
had actually been</i>

12:19.695 --> 12:21.305
<i>a U.S. citizen all along.</i>

12:21.305 --> 12:23.830
<i>Now, how that slipped by
the FBI and her own family</i>

12:23.830 --> 12:25.309
<i>is a story for another time.</i>

12:25.309 --> 12:27.659
Getting evicted
out of our apartment in Hawaii

12:27.659 --> 12:29.096
just sticks with me, man.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.532
It might have been
the lowest moment

12:30.532 --> 12:31.925
I ever experienced as a kid.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.448
Well, it's crazy
how your family went

12:33.448 --> 12:35.798
from being on top
to hitting rock bottom

12:35.798 --> 12:37.365
in basically a year.

12:37.365 --> 12:40.150
That's why you never take
anything for granted, right?

12:40.150 --> 12:42.152
<i>Going through the lows
as a kid in Hawaii</i>

12:42.152 --> 12:43.980
<i>made being able
to share the highs</i>

12:43.980 --> 12:45.634
<i>with my family so special.</i>

12:45.634 --> 12:47.244
Why don't we connect, then?

12:47.244 --> 12:48.332
OK.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.726
I'll let him know.
- Who was that?

12:50.726 --> 12:53.033
I've been returning
the calls you got after "SNL,"

12:53.033 --> 12:55.078
and you got
some major talent agencies

12:55.078 --> 12:56.384
trying to represent you.

12:56.384 --> 12:58.168
- For wrestling?
- For acting.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.518
Like, real Hollywood agents.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.825
Whoa.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.306
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
We should do that.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.221
I thought you said you wanted
to get more into acting,

13:07.221 --> 13:08.831
didn't you?
- Yeah. No, I do.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.051
It's just happening so fast.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.879
How about we just focus
on WrestleMania,

13:12.879 --> 13:14.794
and then we can cross
those bridges afterward?

13:14.794 --> 13:15.969
- OK.
- Yeah?

13:15.969 --> 13:16.970
- Yeah, let's do that.
- We should go.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.145
- Yeah.
- We're already late

13:18.145 --> 13:19.537
for my parents'
housewarming party.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.149
Oh, there you are.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.759
Everyone's here already.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.805
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom. Mwah.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.632
It was Dany's fault.

13:27.632 --> 13:28.851
Don't lie to your mother.

13:28.851 --> 13:29.983
Hey, if you're gonna be
my manager,

13:29.983 --> 13:31.158
you gotta cover for me.

13:31.158 --> 13:32.681
I wouldn't have
believed it, anyway.

13:32.681 --> 13:33.725
Mwah.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.684
Hey, who do we have here?

13:37.991 --> 13:41.255
I dig the new digs,
brother, yeah.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.822
How you doing, Dany?
- Hi.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.301
Now, did you get
a fixed mortgage,

13:44.301 --> 13:45.912
or did you get
the adjustable rate type?

13:45.912 --> 13:47.870
Oh, I forgot
to tell you, Dewey.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.829
Macho's gotten
real boring lately.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.006
Lovely house, bubba.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.572
I find four bathrooms.

13:54.572 --> 13:55.922
Ah, you missed one, Sheik.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.359
Oh?
Sheik will find fifth bathroom.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.361
Hey, Dewey, congratulations
on "Saturday Night Live."

14:00.361 --> 14:02.102
You absolutely crushed it.
- Oh, thank you.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.538
- That was good, brother.
- Thank you. Thank you, Bruno.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.061
Well, I couldn't
stay up that late.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.933
Do you know I haven't been able
to shake this jet lag

14:06.933 --> 14:08.369
since I got back from Toronto?

14:08.369 --> 14:10.893
Wait, Toronto is
in the same time zone as this.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.199
Mm.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.635
Well, I guess
I've just been tired.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.073
So what's the story, Dewey?

14:17.073 --> 14:19.075
You getting all Hollywood
on us, or what?

14:19.075 --> 14:20.555
No,
I'm just gonna concentrate

14:20.555 --> 14:22.383
on WrestleMania next week,
and that's it.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.645
Smart guy.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.429
See, that's why
you're Vince's golden boy.

14:25.429 --> 14:28.911
Everyone who goes Hollywood
always comes crawling back.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.174
That is why I turned down
"Dynasty" show

14:31.174 --> 14:32.697
with jabroni Joan Collins.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.221
"Dynasty" didn't ask you
to be on the show, Sheik.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.918
Don't lie.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.050
"Dynasty" wanted Sheik.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.226
I have paper trail.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.881
I'm looking for a bunch
of meatheads with zero style.

14:44.318 --> 14:47.408
I didn't expect
to see this guy.

14:47.408 --> 14:49.192
Haven't heard from Rocky
in 15 years,

14:49.192 --> 14:51.542
and the second he gets
a new home,

14:51.542 --> 14:52.630
he won't stop calling.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.545
I'm just making up
for lost time.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.288
Hey, Sheik,
you wanna give Hulk the tour?

14:58.288 --> 15:00.900
No, Sheik does not want
to give Hulk a tour.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.597
You find your own
secret bathroom.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.599
Oh, I'll find
the secret bathroom, brother.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.644
No, you won't,
you Barbie bimbo beach doll.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.952
Hey, stop running
in the house!

15:12.650 --> 15:14.870
How you doing, brother?
How you feeling after "SNL"?

15:14.870 --> 15:16.654
It was a rush, right?
- Unreal.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.005
Is it true that you and I
are the only wrestlers

15:19.005 --> 15:20.180
to host the show?

15:20.180 --> 15:22.095
Yes, sir--
pretty exclusive club.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.270
Hey.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.967
What y'all doing in here?

15:24.967 --> 15:27.100
Just got the Mount Rushmore
of wrestling in your kitchen.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.840
I know, right?

15:28.840 --> 15:30.799
Look at us.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.933
Three kings.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.110
We did it.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.459
All right,
I'll see y'all out there.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.462
So what's next for The Rock?

15:41.462 --> 15:42.854
I'm sure everyone wants
a piece of you.

15:42.854 --> 15:45.118
Hey, I'm trying to figure it
all out, you know?

15:45.118 --> 15:47.207
Vince has a great plan
for me this year,

15:47.207 --> 15:50.732
and the fans and the ratings
have all been incredible.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.777
But?

15:52.777 --> 15:54.692
But I'm definitely curious

15:54.692 --> 15:56.651
about where this acting thing
could go.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.783
I just don't know
if it makes sense right now,

15:58.783 --> 16:00.307
you know what I mean?

16:00.307 --> 16:01.830
In a lot of ways, I feel like
I'm at the mountaintop.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.223
Why do more?

16:03.223 --> 16:05.007
Who knows if I can
even juggle both?

16:05.007 --> 16:06.487
Been there, brother.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.054
Why keep climbing if you're
already at the summit?

16:08.054 --> 16:09.490
Exactly.

16:09.490 --> 16:10.970
Any time I feel like
I've reached my ceiling,

16:10.970 --> 16:13.059
I just think, what if
that ceiling is just a floor

16:13.059 --> 16:14.321
to something else?

16:14.321 --> 16:15.887
Back when I was
at the top of WWF,

16:15.887 --> 16:17.977
I decided to try and push
through that ceiling.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.195
Maybe a little too far

16:19.195 --> 16:20.892
with "Suburban Commando"
and "Mr. Nanny"

16:20.892 --> 16:23.025
and, whew, "No Holds Barred."

16:23.025 --> 16:24.374
But I crushed it
in "Gremlins 2."

16:24.374 --> 16:26.681
- Oh, yeah.
- But hey, that's just me.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.118
Well, I hear you, Hulk.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.859
But honestly...

16:32.904 --> 16:36.734
I'd be happy if everything
stayed just like this.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.303
I got news for you, brother.

16:40.303 --> 16:41.565
Whether you pursue
acting or not,

16:41.565 --> 16:42.871
your life ain't
staying like this.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.177
What?

16:44.177 --> 16:45.787
We don't work
at State Farm, man.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.528
Nothing stays the same for long
in this business.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.530
We're all just one match away
from an injury,

16:49.530 --> 16:51.097
one match away
from the fans falling in love

16:51.097 --> 16:52.533
with the new guy.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.317
Ten years ago, you think
I ever thought I'd be a heel

16:54.317 --> 16:55.884
with jet-black beard hair?

16:55.884 --> 16:57.538
Hell no.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.497
So you're saying
I should test my ceiling?

17:00.497 --> 17:02.195
Only you'll know
the answer to that.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.632
When the time comes,
you'll know.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.070
You know,
"Mr. Nanny" wasn't that bad.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.158
It was bad.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.380
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.295
<i>Hogan's words rang true--</i>

17:15.295 --> 17:16.905
<i>nothing stays the same,</i>

17:16.905 --> 17:19.690
<i>and when that time is right,
seize the opportunity.</i>

17:22.041 --> 17:24.260
So Hogan's words gave me
a lot to think about.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.566
Gentlemen.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.439
So I've slept on it--

17:29.439 --> 17:31.876
well, didn't actually sleep.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.661
I had a coffee before bed,

17:33.661 --> 17:35.837
hoping it would inspire me
to an answer.

17:35.837 --> 17:38.622
And eight hours
of non-sleep later,

17:38.622 --> 17:40.450
here we are.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.496
My father is no longer with us,

17:42.496 --> 17:46.021
but I found myself asking him
what it is I should do.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.545
- And what did he say?
- Nothing. He's dead.

17:48.545 --> 17:49.938
He can't talk.
- Yeah, right.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.767
But I do know
what he would have said.

17:52.767 --> 17:55.857
"Angela, you already know
what to do.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.164
Just trust yourself to do it."

17:58.164 --> 18:00.470
So, Mr. Johnson,

18:00.470 --> 18:03.256
I agree to the terms
of your coffee trade deal.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.823
As you said, it feels
like the right opportunity

18:05.823 --> 18:07.608
at the right time
for Gjelgjuighm.

18:07.608 --> 18:08.652
Thank you, Prime Minister.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.132
Of course.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.438
Whoo-hoo!

18:11.438 --> 18:13.266
Yes!

18:13.266 --> 18:15.224
Now let's focus
on what's important.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.008
What were you saying
about Hulk Hogan?

18:17.008 --> 18:18.401
<i>Hogan told me--</i>

18:18.401 --> 18:20.795
<i>and it was as true back then
as it is today--</i>

18:20.795 --> 18:22.753
<i>that you need
to test your ceilings</i>

18:22.753 --> 18:24.581
<i>and see how far you can go.</i>

18:24.581 --> 18:26.975
<i>I was certainly thinking
about that back in 2000</i>

18:26.975 --> 18:29.195
<i>at WrestleMania as I prepared</i>

18:29.195 --> 18:31.327
<i>to step into the arena
I knew so well.</i>

18:31.327 --> 18:32.720
Hey, boss, I don't mean

18:32.720 --> 18:34.156
to interrupt
your pre-game routine,

18:34.156 --> 18:35.940
but Dany gave me strict orders
to give this to you.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.638
- What is it?
- It's from "SNL."

18:37.638 --> 18:39.292
They know I ate all the grapes.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.641
We're ten minutes
from going up.

18:40.641 --> 18:41.816
How important could it be?

18:41.816 --> 18:43.905
I don't know.
Open it up and see.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.167
God, it's killing me.

18:48.562 --> 18:49.954
"Hey, babe.
This came for you.

18:49.954 --> 18:52.305
I think you should
check it out."

18:52.305 --> 18:54.263
"The Mummy Returns."

18:54.263 --> 18:55.438
"The Mummy Returns"?

18:55.438 --> 18:56.831
Where'd the mummy go?

18:56.831 --> 18:58.485
Where's he returning from?

18:58.485 --> 19:01.662
It looks like they want me
to play a role in this--

19:01.662 --> 19:04.317
the Scorpion King.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.927
Badass.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.058
<i>Hulk was right.</i>

19:07.058 --> 19:09.104
<i>In that moment,
I just felt it.</i>

19:09.104 --> 19:11.498
<i>I knew it was time
to test that ceiling,</i>

19:11.498 --> 19:13.239
<i>step into a new arena.</i>

19:13.239 --> 19:15.937
<i>And seizing that opportunity
would take my career</i>

19:15.937 --> 19:17.330
<i>to a whole new level.</i>

19:18.548 --> 19:22.770
Haku machente!

19:25.207 --> 19:27.905
Well, I want to hear more
about "The Mummy."

19:27.905 --> 19:29.342
I also want to hear more
about "The Mummy."

19:29.342 --> 19:31.300
Ah.
Well, those are long stories.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.084
I'll tell you what,
you come to the U.S.,

19:33.084 --> 19:34.825
I'm gonna break open
the tequila,

19:34.825 --> 19:36.610
and I got a lot
of "Mummy" stories.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.133
- Hey.
- The tequila.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.875
Tequila.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.790
Well, that is a deal.

19:42.790 --> 19:45.401
- It's a deal.
- Dwayne Johnson. Mm.

19:45.401 --> 19:48.491
It really has been a pleasure
meeting your candy ass.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.625
Well, the pleasure's been
all mine, jabroni.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.367
Disrespectful.
I can't go out like that.

19:54.367 --> 19:57.631
The pleasure was all mine,
Prime Minister... Jabroni.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.807
- Yeah!
- Hey. Come on, now.

20:00.808 --> 20:01.809
Yeah!

20:01.809 --> 20:03.114
Yes.

20:03.114 --> 20:05.160
- Yes.
- All right.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.422
I'm gonna write
the whole article

20:06.422 --> 20:07.510
on the plane ride home.

20:07.510 --> 20:08.903
I might be the first writer

20:08.903 --> 20:10.426
to make the cover
of "Vanity Fair."

20:10.426 --> 20:12.820
Oh, Randall, no, buddy.
It's not gonna work like that.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.474
Now that I gave Taft the win,

20:14.474 --> 20:17.390
anything that happened between
me and the prime minister

20:17.390 --> 20:18.739
can never go public.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.784
There is no story.
- But I took so many notes.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.264
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.787
But it's in the best interests
of our country.

20:23.787 --> 20:24.919
Plus, they're gonna be happy

20:24.919 --> 20:26.268
to see you
back on "Chatterbox."

20:26.268 --> 20:27.922
No, I had a fourth
Bloody Mary last night

20:27.922 --> 20:30.141
and left an ugly voice mail
for Bibi.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.100
A lot of things
I can't take back.

20:32.100 --> 20:34.363
I need to stop at a gift shop
on my way to the airport,

20:34.363 --> 20:35.756
pick up a little something
for Cheese.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.540
Bye, best friend.
- Bye.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.716
She didn't get
an international data plan,

20:39.716 --> 20:41.892
so she hasn't
listened to it yet.

20:41.892 --> 20:44.417
You know, you were right.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.635
About?

20:45.635 --> 20:47.376
Well, about that kid
in the parking lot

20:47.376 --> 20:49.291
who said
America didn't need me.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.119
Must be hard knowing
America doesn't need you.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.426
<i>- That bothered me.
- I know you 98%.</i>

20:53.426 --> 20:54.775
Yes, you do.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.298
Being the man in the arena,

20:56.298 --> 20:58.082
living through
all these ups and downs,

20:58.082 --> 21:00.998
it doesn't mean it doesn't
still sting when you lose.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.348
And I just want to say
thank you

21:02.348 --> 21:04.959
for encouraging me
to get back up.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.309
It was my pleasure. Happy to.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.137
You know, Randall,
this entire experience

21:09.137 --> 21:12.967
has really got me thinking
that maybe politics wasn't

21:12.967 --> 21:15.317
the wrong arena for me
after all.

21:15.317 --> 21:19.582
Maybe this is just
another false ceiling.

21:19.582 --> 21:21.802
I think I could do it.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.804
What,
run for president again?

21:23.804 --> 21:25.936
No.

21:25.936 --> 21:28.025
Start my own country.

21:29.766 --> 21:30.854
<i>Think that's a good idea.</i>
