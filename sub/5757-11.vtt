WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:04.805
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TELL
ANYONE ANYTHING THAT WE SAY
IN HERE, RIGHT?

00:04.838 --> 00:06.507
UNLESS YOU TELL ME SOMETHING
THAT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE

00:06.540 --> 00:08.309
THAT YOU'RE A DANGER
TO YOURSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.044
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GETTING YOUR OWN ROOM?

00:10.078 --> 00:11.645
THAT WAS BEFORE THE PIPES
WENT OFF BEHIND THE WALLS.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.647
THEY DIDN'T FIX THE PIPES,
SO WE'RE ROOMIES TILL THEN.

00:13.681 --> 00:14.782
N.A.T. CLUB?

00:14.815 --> 00:16.684
JASON DiLORENTIS.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.152
N.I.T. CLUB.
GARY REYNOLDS.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.454
N.I.T.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.456
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE?
SO WHICH ONE IS "A"?

00:22.490 --> 00:25.259
WHAT IS "A"
IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.395
THEY KNOW ABOUT US.
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY FIGURE IT OUT.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.763
WHAT IS GOING ON?
I SAID I DON'T
WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.600
AND I SAID WE HAVE TO!

00:32.633 --> 00:34.735
MY MOM WOULD BE
WITH MY DAD RIGHT NOW
INSTEAD OF HOME ALONE.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.337
TRAINING A HORSE,
IT'S AN ART.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.606
BENDING ITS WILL
TILL IT KNOWS YOUR ITS MASTER.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.474
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
WHEN I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.810
THERE ARE THINGS THAT
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.378
AND I NEED TO.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.679
WHY DON'T WE DO THIS
IN MY OFFICE?

00:47.181 --> 00:48.216
( rings )

00:51.319 --> 00:54.255
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANNA TELL ME
ABOUT MR. FITZ?

00:54.288 --> 00:57.191
ARE MR. FITZ
AND SPENCER INVOLVED?
WHAT? NO.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.334
( crickets chirping )

01:06.367 --> 01:08.469
( sighs )

01:13.607 --> 01:14.675
( phone beeps )

02:07.328 --> 02:08.429
EMILY?

02:17.305 --> 02:19.240
( car starts )

02:25.713 --> 02:27.315
( phone rings )

02:29.950 --> 02:31.485
( phone rings )

02:35.756 --> 02:39.427
YEAH, WE WEREN'T SURE,
WE JUST THOUGHT THAT MAYBE SHE--

02:39.460 --> 02:40.694
YEAH, THANKS.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.230
SHE'S NOT AT SWIM PRACTICE.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.864
I TOLD YOU.
SHE'S NOT ALLOWED NEAR THE POOL.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.599
GUYS, ALL OF HER CLOTHES
ARE HERE.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.336
YOU THINK SHE DID
SOMETHING CRAZY?
LIKE WHAT?

02:48.369 --> 02:51.239
LIKE JUMP IN HER CAR
AND BURN RUBBER TILL
SHE HITS TEXAS.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.574
AND LEAVE EVERYTHING BEHIND?
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE HER PHONE.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.309
I WOULDN'T EITHER
IF I WERE HER.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.911
"A" HAD HIS/HER/ITS HANDS
AROUND HER NECK

02:57.945 --> 02:59.513
AND KEEPS REMINDING HER!

02:59.547 --> 03:01.482
( panting )

03:04.885 --> 03:07.755
SHE HASN'T SLEPT IN WEEKS.
WHO HAS?

03:11.359 --> 03:14.495
HANNA, DID YOU NOT SEE THIS
ON EMILY'S PHONE?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.198
IS THAT YOU?

03:20.434 --> 03:21.635
YEAH, OF COURSE IT'S ME.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.237
WELL, UNLESS YOU'RE ARIA'S MOM,

03:23.271 --> 03:25.739
JUST ASSUME IT'S SPENCER
SLUTTING IT UP.

03:25.773 --> 03:29.009
WHEN DID SHE GET THAT?
3:07 AM
AND IT CAME WITH A TEXT.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.380
"CLUE ELLA IN
AND I'LL LET YOU OUT, "A."

03:32.413 --> 03:33.647
GIVE ME THIS.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.015
ARIA, CHILL.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.884
EMILY WOULD NEVER SEND
THAT TO YOUR MOTHER.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.253
WELL, OF COURSE SHE WOULDN'T
BECAUSE SHE CAN'T,

03:39.287 --> 03:40.921
'CAUSE WE HAVE HER PHONE
AND SHE LEFT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT!

03:40.954 --> 03:41.955
WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?

03:44.592 --> 03:46.694
( continues panting )

04:00.708 --> 04:02.676
HI.

04:02.710 --> 04:06.013
I'M READY TO TALK.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.948
GOOD. COME IN AND JOIN US.

04:17.791 --> 04:22.396
YOUR FRIENDS WERE
HOPING YOU WOULD SHOW UP.

04:22.430 --> 04:25.065
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

04:25.098 --> 04:27.668
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

04:27.701 --> 04:29.637
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

04:29.670 --> 04:31.004
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

04:31.038 --> 04:34.475
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

04:34.508 --> 04:37.811
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

04:37.845 --> 04:41.615
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:45.953 --> 04:48.956
I WAS SLEEPING FIVE FEET AWAY
FROM YOU.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.024
I CAN'T KEEP ASKING MY FRIENDS
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.328
EMILY, LOOK, IF YOU WERE
SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT
GOINT TO TEXAS...

04:54.362 --> 04:56.497
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PLANS.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.600
I JUST KNEW THAT THE LONGER
I STAYED HERE, THE WORSE
IT WAS GONNA GET.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.470
AND I'M NOT GONNA BE USED
LIKE A BOWLING BALL
TO KNOCK DOWN MY BEST FRIENDS.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.339
EMILY, WE'RE SITTING HERE
BECAUSE OF YOU.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.740
NONE OF US THINK THAT YOU--

05:06.774 --> 05:08.476
THAT I'M THE WEAKEST LINK.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.378
YEAH, WELL, SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

05:10.411 --> 05:13.747
WHO? WHO'S USING YOU
TO KNOCK DOWN YOUR FRIENDS?

05:16.517 --> 05:18.386
( sighs )

05:18.419 --> 05:21.455
SOMEBODY THAT'S BEEN
TRYING TO HURT US.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.092
FOR A LONG TIME.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.658
WHEN DID THESE THREATS BEGIN?

06:30.691 --> 06:33.594
DID THE TEXTS START COMING
AFTER ALISON'S FUNERAL?

06:33.627 --> 06:35.763
BEFORE.

06:35.796 --> 06:39.733
AT FIRST WE THOUGHT
THEY WERE COMING FROM ALISON,

06:39.767 --> 06:42.903
BUT THEN THEY FOUND HER,
HER BODY.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.440
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CLUE
WHO THIS "A" PERSON MIGHT BE?

06:46.474 --> 06:48.909
WE DO, BUT...

06:48.942 --> 06:50.978
WE'VE BEEN WRONG BEFORE.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.881
"A" IS AN EXPERT AT MAKING
OTHER PEOPLE LOOK GUILTY.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.917
DO WE THINK THIS PERSON
GOES TO YOUR SCHOOL?

06:56.950 --> 07:00.954
MAYBE, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WE GO
HOME AND WE'RE SUDDENLY SAFE.

07:00.988 --> 07:04.458
"A" IS EVERYWHERE,
CONSTANTLY ON US...

07:04.492 --> 07:06.460
LIKE A SHADOW.

07:06.494 --> 07:10.130
AND I'M THE FIRST PERSON
YOU'VE TOLD ABOUT THIS?

07:12.800 --> 07:16.537
WHY HAVE YOU WAITED THIS LONG
TO SAY SOMETHING?

07:24.978 --> 07:27.080
YOU DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
HAVE MENTIONED HER?

07:27.114 --> 07:29.983
HOW COULD WE WITHOUT SPILLING
EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT SUMMER?

07:30.017 --> 07:32.052
IT JUST KINDA MAKES US LOOK
LIKE WE'RE MAKING IT ALL UP.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.954
SULLIVAN PROBABLY
THINKS WE'RE INSANE.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.123
GUYS, AFTER THE FASHION SHOW,
EVEN HER PARENTS THINK

07:36.156 --> 07:37.991
THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE
MESSING WITH US.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.593
MY DAD STILL WANTS TO SUE.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.161
SUE WHO?
EVERYONE.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.999
HEY, DID YOU BRING THEM?
BRING WHAT?

07:46.033 --> 07:48.268
I'M GIFTING KATE
AT THE REHEARSAL DINNER

07:48.301 --> 07:50.804
SO SHE'LL FORGET I TALKED
SMACK ABOUT HER AND ISABEL.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.841
YOU'RE GIVING HER
A BOOK OF HORSE PICTURES?

07:53.874 --> 07:55.543
YEAH, IT'S CLASSIER
THAN A CALENDAR.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.545
NO, CLASSY WOULD BE
BUYING SOMETHING NEW, HANNA.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.146
SHE'S GONNA KNOW
THAT THESE ARE USED.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.814
NO, SHE WON'T,
AND BESIDES,

08:00.848 --> 08:02.916
YOU HAVE A STAFF
THAT DUSTS YOUR BOOKS.

08:02.950 --> 08:06.019
OH, LOOK,
A HORSE DOING A WHEELIE.
KATE WILL LOVE THAT.

08:06.053 --> 08:09.823
HANNA, YOUR STEP-SISTER
WANTS TO SEE YOU TRAMPLED
BY A HORSE.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.526
IT'S NOT ABOUT HER, OKAY?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.094
IT'S ABOUT MY DAD.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.664
WE'RE FINALLY GETTING ALONG,

08:16.697 --> 08:18.165
AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO BLOW IT
THE WEEK HE'S GETTING MARRIED.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.102
IT'S NOT WHAT WE AGREED ON.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.742
DO WE THINK THAT SHE SENT ME
THAT PICTURE OF ARIA AND FITZ?

08:28.776 --> 08:31.545
YEAH, WE THINK SHE
HAD HELP FROM GARRETT.
YEAH, BUT WHY?

08:31.579 --> 08:34.748
IT'S NOT LIKE TORTURING US IS
GONNA GIVE HER BACK HER SIGHT.

08:34.782 --> 08:37.183
PLUS, THE PERSON SHE REALLY
WANTS TO HURT IS ALREADY DEAD.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.287
YEAH, WELL, SHE PROBABLY
HAD HELP WITH THAT, TOO.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.289
NO WONDER
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.892
GRANDMA.
YOU HAVE A SALAD
IN FRONT OF YOU.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.060
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
EAT ANYTHING GREEN BEFORE.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.261
HOWDY, GIRLS.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.897
All: HEY.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.331
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.933
DON'T WE HAVE
A DINNER TO GO TO?

08:52.966 --> 08:55.168
THAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.672
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS
I JUST RAN A COUPLE STOP SIGNS,
GOT HERE EARLY.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.974
I NEED YOUR HOUSE KEYS.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.876
THEY GOT A LITTLE GIRLS' ROOM
NEAR HERE?

09:02.910 --> 09:05.245
YEAH, IT'S JUST INSIDE
TO THE LEFT.
OH, PERFECT.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.980
HANNA, COME WITH.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.682
SHE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.083
I JUST NEED TO WIPE THE DEW
FROM MY LILY.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.586
OKAY, GRANDMA, NO.
WALKING NOW.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.122
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.258
I'M NOW OFFICIALLY
DONE EATING FOREVER.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.028
NO, I CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.897
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

09:23.931 --> 09:27.968
MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE SKIPPED
DR. SULLIVAN AND GONE
STRAIGHT TO THE POLICE.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.138
GARRETT IS ON THE FORCE, EM.
JENNA GOT THERE FIRST.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.740
HOW LONG ARE WE GONNA WAIT
UNTIL WE DO SOMETHING?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.341
WE ARE DOING SOMETHING.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.611
HE'S SEEING SOMEONE WHO
SPECIALIZES IN TEEN DEPRESSION.

09:37.645 --> 09:38.812
GIVE IT SOME TIME.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.347
THAT SOMEONE ALSO SUGGESTED,

09:40.380 --> 09:43.083
GIVEN MY FAMILY HISTORY,
THAT HE SEE A PSYCHIATRIST.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.686
SOMEONE WHO CAN WRITE
A PRESCRIPTION.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.756
AGAIN,
MIKE IS NOT YOUR BROTHER.
NO, HE IS RELATED TO HIM.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.224
OKAY, CAN WE CROSS
THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE GET THERE?

09:51.258 --> 09:52.826
IF WE GET THERE?

09:52.860 --> 09:55.228
WE'RE THERE NOW.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.064
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED
TO OUR KID, ELLA,

09:57.097 --> 09:58.932
AND I WANT HIM BACK.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.233
AND HE WILL COME BACK.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.135
HE JUST NEEDS A LITTLE HELP
FINDING HIS WAY.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.705
AND THAT MAY NOT COME
FROM A BOTTLE OF PILLS.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.807
HERE WE GO AGAIN. DON'T--
HE NEEDS TO TALK
ABOUT HIS FEELINGS,

10:06.840 --> 10:08.809
NOT BURY THEM
UNDER MEDICATION.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.110
YOU ARE NOT A DOCTOR.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.646
I DON'T THINK THAT'S YOUR CALL.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.882
I'M NOT SAYING THAT SOME KIDS
DON'T NEED THEM, THEY DO,

10:14.915 --> 10:16.650
BUT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.786
I UNDER--

10:18.819 --> 10:21.789
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

10:23.223 --> 10:25.693
NOTHING.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.829
DAD, I THOUGHT YOU HAD A CLASS?

10:28.862 --> 10:31.932
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS THIS ABOUT MIKE?
NO.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.370
GRABBING A BITE
BEFORE I HEAD OFF TO CAMPUS.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.007
BYRON, WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO HER BROTHER IS NOT A SECRET.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.976
IT AFFECTS HER, TOO.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.146
YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
ON WHAT TO DO ABOUT MIKE.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.315
AND I'M NOT TAKING A POLL.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.083
OKAY, WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

10:53.253 --> 10:56.456
SO WAS THE OCEAN FREEZING?

10:56.489 --> 11:00.761
OKAY, CALEB, GO BACK.
WHOSE WETSUIT DID YOU BORROW?

11:00.794 --> 11:03.196
NOT SKEEVY.

11:03.230 --> 11:07.434
I'M JUST JEALOUS OF ANYTHING
GETTING THAT CLOSE TO YOU.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.802
( giggles )

11:08.836 --> 11:10.938
( phone beeps )

11:10.971 --> 11:14.975
UH, CAN I CALL YOU BACK?
MY DAD'S ON THE OTHER LINE.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.810
HEY, DAD, WHAT'S UP?

11:18.779 --> 11:20.781
TOGETHER?

11:20.814 --> 11:23.717
NO, NO, NO, I'M TOTALLY INTO IT.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.854
IT'S JUST--
IT'LL BE FUN.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.189
LOVE YOU, TOO.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.026
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

11:33.060 --> 11:34.728
MY DAD WANTS ME AND KATE

11:34.762 --> 11:36.429
TO TOAST TOMORROW NIGHT
AT THE DINNER.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.999
NEAT TRICK.
ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.400
WELL, SURE, WHY NOT?

11:40.433 --> 11:42.302
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS?

11:42.335 --> 11:44.371
WHY IS HE TYING THE KNOT
WITH THAT WOMAN?

11:44.404 --> 11:46.406
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HE LOVES ISABEL.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.509
AND LIKE MY MOM SAYS,
HE DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.246
HAPPY? WHAT'S HAPPY?
COWS ARE HAPPY,
AND THEY END UP AS SLOPPY JOES.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.348
HEY THERE, SWEETIE!

11:55.382 --> 11:57.084
HELLO, REGINA.

11:57.117 --> 12:00.253
AH, LOOK AT YOUR PRETTY MAMA.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.390
ALL DOLLED UP
LIKE CONDOLEEZA RICE.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.858
TURN AROUND.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.259
WHY ARE ALL THE BOWLS OUT?

12:06.293 --> 12:08.862
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR
A BETTER PLACE FOR THEM.

12:08.896 --> 12:12.265
IT JUST SEEMED SILLY
THAT THEY'RE SO FAR
FROM THE STOVE.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.035
UM, DAD WANTS ME
TO GIVE A TOAST TOMORROW NIGHT.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.937
OH.
WITH KATE.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.373
I SAY SKIP IT.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.009
I VOTE FOR SKIPPING EVERYTHING.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.211
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:24.244 --> 12:27.180
THIS CHILD DOES NOT WANNA SEE
HER DADDY GO THROUGH WITH THIS,
AND NEITHER DO YOU.

12:27.214 --> 12:30.417
REGINA--
TOMMY IS JUST WAITING
FOR YOU TO TAKE HIM BACK.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.085
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.087
EVERY TIME I MENTION YOUR NAME,
HE TURNS TO MUSH.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.223
TOM THINKS YOU HUNG THE MOON,
ASHLEY,

12:36.256 --> 12:38.191
AND I'LL BET THAT THERE'S
SOMEONE ELSE HERE WHO FEELS
THE SAME WAY.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.793
RIGHT, HANNA?

12:39.827 --> 12:42.095
SO THIS IS WHY
YOU CAME HERE EARLY?

12:42.129 --> 12:43.931
NO, I SHOULD'VE
COME MONTHS AGO.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.232
YOU'VE GOTTA FIGHT
FOR YOUR MAN.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.001
I AM NOT FIGHTING FOR TOM,
REGINA.

12:48.035 --> 12:51.404
OUR MARRIAGE ENDED
A LONG TIME AGO, AND HANNA
AND I HAVE MADE PIECE WITH THAT.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.407
I WOULD APPRECIATE
IF YOU WOULD DROP THE SUBJECT.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.177
STOP BAITING YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER,
AND PUT THOSE MIXING BOWLS
BACK WHERE YOU FOUND THEM!

12:57.210 --> 12:59.079
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
( sighs )

13:01.314 --> 13:03.316
ARE YOU LYING TO YOURSELF, TOO?

13:08.255 --> 13:10.190
HEY.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.292
MOM NEEDS YOU
TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND HELP GET DINNER READY.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.929
MIKE.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.030
CLOSE THE DOOR!

13:18.231 --> 13:19.833
I SAID GET OUT!

13:19.867 --> 13:24.171
NO. NO, I'M NOT
GONNA GET OUT.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.207
MIKE, YOU NEED
TO LET SOMEBODY IN,

13:27.240 --> 13:29.409
AND NOT SOME...
STRANGER ONLINE.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.244
WHO ARE ARE YOU
EVEN TALKING TO?

13:31.278 --> 13:32.880
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

13:32.913 --> 13:35.148
NOBODY INVITED HER IN.

13:35.182 --> 13:38.285
I TRIED.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.889
MIKE, TURN OFF THE COMPUTER
AND COME DOWNSTAIRS.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.324
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
DID YOU EVEN EAT LUNCH?

13:44.357 --> 13:46.159
WHO CARES?

13:46.193 --> 13:48.295
JUST CLOSE THE DOOR,
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.597
NO. YOU'RE DONE
GIVE ME THE--

13:50.630 --> 13:51.965
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:51.999 --> 13:53.433
LET GO!
STOP IT! AAAH!

14:03.443 --> 14:05.178
MOM.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.947
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:10.050 --> 14:13.987
I'M OKAY.
UM...

14:14.021 --> 14:17.190
WHEN YOUR FATHER GETS HOME,
THIS DID NOT HAPPEN.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.391
NO. MOM--
I HAVE TO TELL HIM

14:18.425 --> 14:20.527
THAT I TRIPPED
ON THE STAIRS,

14:20.560 --> 14:22.162
AND YOU'RE GONNA TELL HIM
THE SAME THING.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.897
MOM, YOU CAN'T
JUST LET HIM--

14:23.931 --> 14:25.665
NO. HE CANNOT
KNOW ABOUT ABOUT THIS.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.434
THIS DID NOT HAPPEN.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.503
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.941
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME ICE,
AND YOU NEED TO SET THE TABLE.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.551
I'M BETTING IT WAS GARY
ON THE PHONE,

14:44.584 --> 14:46.920
AND THEY WERE PROBABLY
HAVING SOME KIND OF FIGHT.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.356
I'M STILL WONDERING WHY THEY
WERE BOTH AT JASON'S HOUSE.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.092
MAYBE THE "WE SEE EVERYTHING
CLUB" IS BACK IN SESSION.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.660
SO WHAT'S JENNA, THEN,
THEIR MASCOT?

14:53.693 --> 14:55.562
MAYBE I COULD
FIND OUT MORE.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.098
NO. JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.300
PLEASE DON'T GIVE HER
A FRESH REASON TO
BREAK US UP.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.035
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.637
TOBY, YOU SAY THAT NOW,
BUT IF SHE'S JOINED THAT CLUB--

15:04.671 --> 15:08.308
SPENCER...
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.719
Sullivan:
THE PRESSURE YOU'RE UNDER AT
THIS POINT CAN BE OVERWHELMING.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.223
CHOOSING THE RIGHT COLLEGE,
GETTING IN, LEAVING HOME--

15:23.256 --> 15:25.325
IT CAN ALL BE SCARY.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.494
A FEW WEEKS AGO
YOUR PRINCIPAL ASKED ME

15:27.527 --> 15:30.330
TO COME AND TALK ABOUT
SOME OF THE TOUGH CHOICES
YOU'RE FACING.

15:32.365 --> 15:37.637
BUT HOW CAN YOU MAKE
ANY GOOD CHOICES...

15:37.670 --> 15:41.274
WHEN YOU'RE NOT
IN A SAFE PLACE?

15:41.308 --> 15:44.244
MANY OF YOU DON'T FEEL SAFE.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.446
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T
MAKE A MOVE WITHOUT SOMEONE

15:46.479 --> 15:49.149
JUDGING YOU OR
CHALLENGING YOU...

15:49.182 --> 15:52.252
OR WORSE, THREATENING YOU.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.722
BULLIES HAVE BEEN AROUND
SINCE THE FIRST CAVEMAN
INVENTED THE CLUB.

15:55.755 --> 15:58.758
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL
THE ATTITUDE WAS,
KIDS ARE CRUEL,

15:58.791 --> 16:02.429
BUT BEING ROUGHED UP A LITTLE
BUILT CHARACTER.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.332
TODAY'S BULLIES CAN CAUSE
A LOT MORE DAMAGE.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.200
THEY HAVE BETTER WEAPONS.

16:07.234 --> 16:10.303
THEY CAN KEEP HITTING "SEND"
OVER AND OVER,

16:10.337 --> 16:13.373
AND HIDE BEHIND
THE ANONYMITY OF A TEXT
OR AN EMAIL,

16:13.406 --> 16:16.143
WHICH IS ABOUT
AS COWARDLY AS IT GETS.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.745
WOULD IT BE BAD IF WE RAN
TO THE BATHROOM RIGHT NOW?

16:18.778 --> 16:20.780
WAY BAD.
WHY IS SHE DOING THIS?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.582
SHHH!

16:22.615 --> 16:26.153
THESE VICIOUS ATTACKS
SENT THROUGH ELECTRONIC MEANS

16:26.186 --> 16:28.155
MAY AS WELL BE CARVED IN STONE.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.457
IF YOU THINK
A COLLEGE ADMISSIONS BOARD,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.425
NOT TO MENTION A JURY,

16:32.459 --> 16:36.329
WON'T EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE,
YOU'RE SADLY MISTAKEN.

16:36.363 --> 16:40.133
ALL IT TAKES IS FOR THE VICTIMS
TO STOP BEING AFRAID

16:40.167 --> 16:41.701
AND DECIDE TO SPEAK UP...

16:41.734 --> 16:43.370
AND SPEAK OUT.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.372
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS
SHE'S MADE THINGS WORSE?

16:45.405 --> 16:48.075
WHY WOULD IT BE WORSE?
BECAUSE SHE JUST
TORE OUR CLOTHES OFF,

16:48.108 --> 16:49.542
BASICALLY, IN FRONT
OF THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.278
SHE WASN'T BETRAYING US,
HAN.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.480
THIS IS SOMEONE
TRYING TO HELP US
TAKE DOWN THE ENEMY.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.282
IS YOUR PHONE BACK ON?
YEAH. WHY?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.217
WELL, SULLIVAN FINISHED
TEN MINUTES AGO,

16:57.250 --> 17:00.687
AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM THE BEAST.
SO THAT'S PROGRESS.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.822
Hanna: OR THE QUIET
BEFORE THE STORM.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.791
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?
HMM? NOTHING.

17:05.825 --> 17:09.296
LOOK, SULLIVAN'S RIGHT.
IT WAS TIME TO SPEAK UP.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.431
( tapping )

17:18.605 --> 17:20.640
I'LL TALK TO YOU GUYS LATER.
Jenna: ARIA?

17:20.673 --> 17:23.343
DID YOU GO TO THE ASSEMBLY?

17:23.376 --> 17:26.313
YEAH, WE ALL DID,
JENNA. WHY?

17:26.346 --> 17:29.749
JUST CURIOUS. WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE SHRINK'S SPEECH?

17:29.782 --> 17:32.219
TOO LITTLE TOO LATE, HUH?

17:32.252 --> 17:33.786
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.822
IT'S JUST A SHAME
ST. SULLIVAN WASN'T AROUND

17:35.855 --> 17:38.525
WHEN YOUR FRIEND ALISON
WAS RULING THESE HALLS.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.728
I GUESS IT TAKES ONE BULLY
TO KNOW ANOTHER, JENNA.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.430
COULD YOU PLEASE
MOVE YOUR STICK?

17:43.463 --> 17:45.732
THERE ARE PEOPLE TRYING
TO GET PAST YOU.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.677
Tom: CLARE, ALEX, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET MY BEAUTIFUL MOTHER,
REGINA MARIN.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.579
SHE DROVE IN FROM CINCINNATI.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.382
CLARE AND ALEX ARE OLD FRIENDS
OF ISABEL'S FROM COLLEGE.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.616
I'M SURE I'VE MENTIONED
THEM TO YOU.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.452
IF YOU DID,
I DON'T REMEMBER.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.686
SURE YOU DO, MOM.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.655
WE TRAVELED TO MEXICO
LAST YEAR.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.790
CLARE AND ALEX.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.360
I DON'T REMEMBER NAMES.

18:13.393 --> 18:17.264
DO YOU ALREADY HAVE THESE?
I CAN EXCHANGE THEM.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.132
I KNOW I HAVE
THE RECEIPT SOMEWHERE.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.234
NO. I LIKE THEM.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.770
I JUST FELT REALLY BAD
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE STABLES...

18:23.803 --> 18:27.840
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I SAID
AND HOW I TREATED YOUR HORSE.

18:27.874 --> 18:31.811
I THOUGHT HE WAS
THE ONE WHO BIT YOU.
YEAH, WELL, I HAD IT COMING.

18:31.844 --> 18:35.182
I'M NOT EXACTLY PROUD
ABOUT WHAT I SAID TO YOU
ON THE PHONE, EITHER.

18:35.215 --> 18:38.585
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN
JUST START OVER?

18:38.618 --> 18:42.289
I MEAN, THIS WHOLE SITUATION
IS WEIRD, ANY WAY YOU
LOOK AT IT.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.523
TOTALLY.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.392
BEFORE IT WAS JUST
ME AND MY MOM,

18:45.425 --> 18:47.427
AND NOW THERE'S TOM...

18:47.460 --> 18:49.862
AND A SEAT ALWAYS UP
ON OUR TOILET.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.199
SHOULD WE PUT THAT
IN THE TOAST?

18:52.232 --> 18:53.933
DON'T FEEL BAD.
SHE FORGETS MY NAME TOO.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.203
NO, I DON'T, TOM.
I'M NOT SENILE.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.771
I JUST ALREADY HAVE TOO MANY
PEOPLE LIVING IN MY HEAD.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.677
HEY, YOU TWO.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

19:04.711 --> 19:07.380
UM, WE'RE COMIN' UP
WITH STUFF.
THAT'S GREAT.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.216
YOU'RE SPEAKING
JUST BEFORE DESSERT,

19:09.249 --> 19:11.384
AND IF YOU DON'T,
MY MOTHER WILL.

19:11.418 --> 19:15.188
Regina: DO YOU THINK
THEY HAVE ANYTHING HARDER
THAN THIS BUBBLY WINE?

19:15.222 --> 19:17.890
COULD WE GET
TWO LEMONADES, PLEASE?

19:17.924 --> 19:19.692
DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE DRESS?

19:19.726 --> 19:21.928
THE WEDDING DRESS?
IT'S HERE?

19:21.961 --> 19:23.896
I'M ITS BABY-SITTER.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.903
WOW.
IT'S AWESOME.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.739
IT'S, LIKE, RIDICULOUS.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.874
HERE, LET'S SIT
AND WORK ON THE SPEECH.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.709
YOU CAN DO MOST OF THE TALKING.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.878
SERIOUSLY, I'M WAY BETTER
AT NODDING.

19:38.911 --> 19:42.482
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
WE ARE SO IN THIS TOGETHER.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.257
WHAT IS THAT?

19:50.290 --> 19:51.958
LIQUID COURAGE.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.193
WAS THAT VODKA?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.829
WANT SOME?

19:56.863 --> 19:58.798
AH, I DON'T THINK SO.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.568
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT
SPEAKING IN FRONT
OF STRANGERS, BUT--

20:01.601 --> 20:02.702
SERIOUSLY
TAKES THE EDGE OFF.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.371
HIT ME.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.910
( liquid pouring )

20:15.948 --> 20:17.717
( microwave dings )

20:24.857 --> 20:28.495
OH, HI. I DIDN'T EVEN
REALIZE YOU WERE HOME.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.363
YOU HUNGRY?

20:30.397 --> 20:33.766
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT COMPANY?
ABSOLUTELY.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.345
( phone ringing )

20:45.378 --> 20:47.046
HELLO.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.816
AND I'M THE FIRST PERSON
 YOU'VE TOLD ABOUT THIS...

20:49.849 --> 20:52.719
AND I'M THE FIRST PERSON
 YOU'VE TOLD ABOUT THIS...

20:52.752 --> 20:55.788
AND I'M THE FIRST PERSON
 YOU'VE TOLD ABOUT THIS...

20:55.822 --> 20:57.290
AND I'M--

20:58.491 --> 21:00.727
( phone rings )

21:00.760 --> 21:03.296
HELLO?
 ...TOLD ABOUT THIS.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.798
AND I'M THE FIRST PERSON
 YOU'VE TOLD ABOUT THIS...
WHO IS THIS?

21:05.832 --> 21:09.035
AND I'M THE FIRST PERSON
 YOU'VE TOLD ABOUT THIS...

21:09.068 --> 21:10.603
AND I'M--

21:17.410 --> 21:19.512
WHAT ABOUT THE WINDOWS?

21:19.546 --> 21:21.814
MOST DEVICES ARE PLANTED
IN THE INTERIOR WALLS.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.316
IF YOU'RE GOING TO
THE TROUBLE TO BUG SOMEONE,

21:23.350 --> 21:24.717
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
RECORDING TRAFFIC.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.319
ARE YOU WILLING TO
OPEN UP THESE WALLS?

21:26.353 --> 21:27.654
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES, YES.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.558
WHAT'D YOU FIND?
NOTHING IN THE HALL.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.561
IT'S NOT IN THE HALL.
THIS WAS TAPED IN THIS ROOM.

21:34.594 --> 21:37.330
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
THAT THE CLIENT YOU WERE
TREATING COULD HAVE DONE IT?

21:37.364 --> 21:39.632
NO. THIS WAS NOT
A NORMAL SESSION.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.401
THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE
IN THE ROOM,

21:41.434 --> 21:42.869
THE VISIT WASN'T
EVEN SCHEDULED.

21:42.902 --> 21:46.639
MAYBE IF YOU GIVE US
THE PEOPLE'S NAMES,

21:46.673 --> 21:48.541
WE COULD INVESTIGATE
FURTHER--

21:48.575 --> 21:50.309
I CAN'T.
THEY'RE CLIENTS.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.080
IT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

21:54.113 --> 21:57.384
THEY'RE NOT THE ONES
WHO MADE THIS RECORDING.
YOU'RE SURE OF THAT?

21:57.417 --> 22:01.053
THIS IS THE SECOND
POLICE REPORT I'VE FILED.
THIS OFFICE WAS VANDALIZED.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.722
IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO FURNISH NAMES,

22:02.755 --> 22:04.357
THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT
WE CAN DO.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.359
YOU'LL GET A CALL
FROM DETECTIVE KLEIN.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.361
SORRY ABOUT THIS.
GOOD NIGHT.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.368
OKAY, HOW DOES
THIS SOUND...

22:15.402 --> 22:17.837
"THEY SAY THAT TEENAGERS
LOSE THEIR MINDS
WHEN THEY FALL IN LOVE,

22:17.870 --> 22:19.939
"AND IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN
AROUND TOM AND MY MOM,

22:19.972 --> 22:23.075
YOU'D SWEAR THEY NEVER
GOT OUT OF 11th GRADE."

22:23.109 --> 22:24.944
DOES THAT MAKE YOU
WANT TO GAG?

22:24.977 --> 22:28.615
NO. IT'S PERFECT.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.917
AND TRUE.
YOU JUST LEFT THE PLANET.

22:30.950 --> 22:31.984
WHO'S YOUR SCREENSAVER?

22:35.021 --> 22:37.089
YUM.
WHAT IS HIS NAME,

22:37.123 --> 22:38.491
IS HE COMING TO THE WEDDING,

22:38.525 --> 22:40.393
AND DOES HE HAVE
ANY BROTHERS?

22:40.427 --> 22:42.529
CALEB, YES, TWO BROTHERS,

22:42.562 --> 22:44.697
BUT THEY ARE FIVE AND SEVEN.

22:44.731 --> 22:48.435
DAMN. I DON'T THINK
I CAN WAIT FOR THEM.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.937
OH, CRAP.
WHAT? WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.539
IT'S MY UNCLE ROY.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.106
DON'T--DON'T TURN.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.775
JUST DRINK UP.
WHAT?!

22:55.808 --> 22:57.810
BEFORE HE COMES OVER,
DRINK UP.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.651
FALSE ALARM.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.553
SORRY.

23:08.154 --> 23:11.458
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET IN THERE.
WE'RE COOL.

23:11.491 --> 23:14.761
CAN WE GET
TWO MORE OF THESE

23:14.794 --> 23:17.730
AND SOME OF THAT
COCONUT SHRIMP?

23:20.567 --> 23:24.036
OKAY. WHERE WOULD YOU PUT
A MEASURING CUP

23:24.070 --> 23:26.639
IF YOU WERE A CRAZY WOMAN
FROM OKLAHOMA?

23:26.673 --> 23:29.776
CAN I JUST ASK,
WHY IS MR. MARIN'S MOTHER
STAYING WITH YOU

23:29.809 --> 23:32.011
IF YOU GUYS
AREN'T MARRIED ANYMORE?

23:32.044 --> 23:34.647
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
WE LIKE EACH OTHER A LOT.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.949
I THINK SHE LIKES ME
MORE THAN HER OWN SON.

23:36.983 --> 23:40.687
OKAY, WHY WOULD YOU PUT
A SPATULA IN THE SAME DRAWER
AS A GLUE GUN?

23:42.855 --> 23:45.925
THIS...MUST BE
SO WEIRD FOR YOU.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.861
NOT REALLY.
SHE GAVE US A LAWN MOWER
FOR A WEDDING GIFT.

23:48.895 --> 23:52.532
NO, I MEAN...
KNOWING THAT THE PERSON
YOU WERE MARRIED TO

23:52.565 --> 23:54.734
IS NOW MARRYING SOMEONE ELSE.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.670
OH. THAT.

23:57.704 --> 24:01.007
YEAH, IT'S...
NEW TERRITORY.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.109
BUT I'M OKAY WITH IT.

24:05.578 --> 24:09.649
WHY ARE YOU OKAY
HAVING FROZEN DINNER WITH ME
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?

24:09.682 --> 24:11.751
WHERE'S SAMARA?

24:11.784 --> 24:13.653
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.588
BEYOND REPAIR?

24:16.956 --> 24:18.625
I DON'T KNOW.

24:18.658 --> 24:22.094
THERE'S STILL
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.797
AH. I'VE HAD THOSE.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.867
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

24:27.900 --> 24:29.736
BUT IF HANNA'S FATHER
HADN'T COME BACK INTO TOWN,

24:29.769 --> 24:31.804
I WOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN MINE ANSWERED.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.509
WHEN THE OTHER PERSON
ISN'T THERE,

24:36.543 --> 24:40.613
SOMETIME WE TEND TO MAKE UP
THEIR SIDE OF THE CONVERSATION.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.616
WHICH REALLY ISN'T FAIR
TO EITHER ONE OF YOU.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.585
YEAH.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.019
I'VE DONE THAT MORE THAN ONCE.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.688
YEAH.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.159
( sighs ) OKAY.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.563
I GIVE UP. SHE'S GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE ME
A MAP IN THE MORNING.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.571
THANKS, EMILY.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.739
THANKS FOR MAKING
A ROUGH NIGHT

25:06.773 --> 25:09.576
A LITTLE LESS...ROUGH.

25:11.611 --> 25:12.845
GOOD NIGHT.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.628
HEY, THERE.
HEY.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.929
WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

25:29.962 --> 25:31.664
IN THE SHOWER.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.801
SO, HAS EVERYONE
EATEN ALREADY?

25:34.834 --> 25:36.603
WELL, DEFINE "EVERYONE."

25:38.104 --> 25:39.706
MOM AND I DID.

25:39.739 --> 25:43.309
ARIA, DON'T BE SO UNFORGIVING
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.578
HE MAY BE DOING
THE VERY BEST HE CAN.

25:45.612 --> 25:48.681
THERE'S JUST A LOT OF STUFF
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.250
AND SOME STUFF
I WISH I DIDN'T.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.819
HI. YOU'RE HOME.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.587
THERE'S A PLATE FOR YOU
IN THE FRIDGE.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.255
THAT'S OKAY, I CAN WAIT.

25:56.288 --> 25:59.291
SO, HOW'S THE WRIST?
STILL SWOLLEN?

25:59.325 --> 26:01.594
NO, NO, NOT MUCH.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.664
I THINK YOU SHOULD
HAVE THAT X-RAYED.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.733
NO, THAT'S
NOT NECESSARY, REALLY.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.704
I'M GONNA GO
STUDY UPSTAIRS.

26:18.277 --> 26:21.147
UM, COULD YOU
LEAVE THAT, PLEASE?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.865
HELLO, MAYA.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.967
HELLO, EMILY.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.891
WHAT?

27:04.924 --> 27:07.059
I THOUGHT
I SAW SOMETHING.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.327
YOU KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN?

27:08.360 --> 27:10.329
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I JUST --

27:10.362 --> 27:12.331
I THOUGHT I SAW A SHADOW
IN THE UPSTAIRS WINDOW

27:12.364 --> 27:14.166
IN JASON'S HOUSE
WATCHING US.

27:16.435 --> 27:19.972
NEVER MIND.
UH, MY BAD.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.941
HERE, COME HERE.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.415
NO, NO. WAIT.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.818
THERE ARE TWO SHADOWS
UP THERE.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.886
WHAT?
JASON'S NOT ALONE.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.089
I JUST SAW TWO SHADOWS.
GARRETT'S PROBABLY UP THERE
WATCHING WITH HIM.

27:37.123 --> 27:40.092
OH, SPENCER.
I WOULDN'T EVEN BE SURPRISED
IF JENNA WAS UP THERE, TOO,

27:40.126 --> 27:42.094
HOLDING THE CORD
WHILE THEY VIDEOTAPE US

27:42.128 --> 27:43.863
FOR THEIR PERVERTED
LITTLE ARCHIVES.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.397
LET'S JUST GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.934
NO! DR. SULLIVAN'S RIGHT.
OKAY, I'M DONE RUNNING.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.936
THEY NEED TO KNOW
THAT I'M NOT AFRAID OF THEM.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.739
NO, NO, NO, SPENCER!
NO, SPENCER, WAIT!

27:52.772 --> 27:54.941
NO, NO, NO, SPENCER!

27:54.974 --> 27:57.043
SPENCER, WAIT!

28:01.280 --> 28:02.681
DAD?

28:09.255 --> 28:11.991
DAD, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

28:12.024 --> 28:13.760
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT JASON'S HOUSE?

28:13.793 --> 28:15.227
WE WERE TALKING
 ABOUT HIS FENCE.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.063
NO, YOU'RE DONE WITH THAT.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.765
YOU SET THE TOWN'S
ZONING BOARD'S AGAINST HIM.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.299
LET'S NOT DO THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

28:20.332 --> 28:22.201
DAD, I CAN'T LEAVE
THIS ALONE!

28:22.234 --> 28:24.203
WHY ARE YOU HAVING
SECRET MEETINGS
WITH THIS FAMILY,

28:24.236 --> 28:26.806
FIRST WITH ALISON'S
MOTHER AND NOW
WITH HER BROTHER?

28:26.839 --> 28:28.440
I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTIONS.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.943
YEAH, YOU
KIND OF DO.

28:30.977 --> 28:33.279
ANOTHER REMARK LIKE THAT,
AND YOU'LL BE LOOKING FOR A JOB.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.147
SPENCER DESERVES
SOME ANSWERS.

28:35.181 --> 28:38.484
ANSWERS? AND JUST
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU, HUH?

28:38.517 --> 28:40.787
DID YOU TAKE THIS JOB
AT MY HOUSE SO YOU
COULD STIR UP TROUBLE?

28:40.820 --> 28:42.154
DAD, STOP.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.956
NO, YOU COULDN'T
WAIT TO RUN TO HER

28:43.990 --> 28:45.892
AND TELL HER ABOUT
WHAT YOU UNEARTHED
IN OUR YARD.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.995
IT WAS HER HOCKEY STICK!
AND IT WAS NONE
OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!

28:49.028 --> 28:50.529
NONE OF THIS IS!

28:50.562 --> 28:52.331
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GET
IN THAT TRUCK OF YOURS

28:52.364 --> 28:54.133
AND KEEP DRIVING,
YOU GOT ME?

28:54.166 --> 28:56.302
JUST DON'T LISTEN
TO HIM, OKAY?

28:56.335 --> 28:58.537
SPENCER, DON'T GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.
I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS!

28:58.570 --> 29:01.908
GO TO THE HOUSE. NOW!
GO TO THE HOUSE.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.418
NO, NO, SPENCER!
SPENCER!

29:14.220 --> 29:15.888
GET OUT OF THE CAR!

29:28.567 --> 29:30.069
( rattling )

29:45.852 --> 29:47.286
SO, YOU'VE BEEN
BACK SINCE...

29:47.319 --> 29:49.155
ABOUT TWO WEEKS.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.323
MY PARENTS ARE
RENTING THIS HOUSE
IN BUCKS COUNTY.

29:51.357 --> 29:52.524
THAT'S SO CLOSE!

29:52.558 --> 29:54.326
FORTY-FIVE MINUTES
TO GET HERE?

29:54.360 --> 29:57.864
YEAH, CLOSE-ISH.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.332
SO, YOUR PARENTS
WENT TO TEXAS,

30:00.366 --> 30:02.902
BUT YOU STAYED HERE?

30:02.935 --> 30:05.504
MOMMY MUST TRUST
YOU THESE DAYS.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.074
YEAH, RIGHT.

30:08.107 --> 30:12.144
SHE'S PROBABLY GOT
SOMEONE WATCHING US
RIGHT NOW.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.046
HEY, PAM,
HOW'S IT GOING?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.115
( laughs )

30:16.148 --> 30:18.150
MY MOM'S NOT LIKE
THAT ANYMORE.

30:18.184 --> 30:23.622
SHE'S REALLY COME AROUND
TO ME BEING... ME.

30:23.655 --> 30:27.526
A LOT HAS GONE DOWN
SINCE I LEFT.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.863
( both speaking )

30:30.897 --> 30:32.031
OH!

30:32.064 --> 30:33.332
YOU FIRST.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.234
NO, MY FAULT.
YOU GO.

30:35.267 --> 30:39.138
I GUESS I'M
JUST WONDERING...

30:39.171 --> 30:42.308
WHAT MADE YOU
DECIDE TO CALL.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.444
WHEN YOU WERE STILL HERE,

30:45.477 --> 30:48.347
I WAS NOT IN A GOOD PLACE.

30:48.380 --> 30:51.984
I MEAN, THERE WERE
THINGS... PEOPLE

30:52.018 --> 30:53.552
I WAS AFRAID OF.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.354
I KNOW.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.656
I WAS ONE OF THEM.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.526
YOU WERE, AND I'M
SORRY FOR THAT,

31:00.559 --> 31:02.328
BUT I'M NOT AFRAID ANYMORE,

31:02.361 --> 31:04.931
OF YOU, OF ME, OF ANYONE.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.899
SO MANY THINGS
WERE HOLDING ME BACK,

31:06.933 --> 31:10.436
BUT I'M READY NOW TO MOVE ON
AND MAKE REAL PLANS --

31:10.469 --> 31:14.073
WHOA, EM! SLOW DOWN.
NOW YOU'RE SCARING ME.

31:15.541 --> 31:16.943
AM I?

31:16.976 --> 31:18.911
RELAX.

31:18.945 --> 31:23.015
I'M NOT LEAVING BEFORE
I GET MY CALAMARI.

31:44.670 --> 31:45.972
MIKE?

31:49.441 --> 31:51.410
HEY.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.579
IS MOM GONNA
BE OKAY?

31:53.612 --> 31:55.414
YEAH.

32:02.421 --> 32:06.258
AM I?

32:06.292 --> 32:08.394
YES.

32:21.073 --> 32:24.676
WOW. THIS IS SO PRETTY.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.412
YOU KNOW, I --

32:26.445 --> 32:29.148
I WANT TO LIVE IN HERE,
DON'T YOU?

32:29.181 --> 32:32.151
I GUESS, IF YOU LIKE
THE SOUND OF FLUSHING.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.186
( unzips )

32:34.220 --> 32:38.224
CAN I JUST SAY THAT I
WAS SO NERVOUS ABOUT TONIGHT,

32:38.257 --> 32:41.093
BUT I'M ACTUALLY HAVING
A LOT OF FUN.

32:41.127 --> 32:45.464
I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN YOU
A REAL HORSE BOOK...

32:45.497 --> 32:50.469
SOMETHING BIG AND FAT
AND EXPENSIVE WITH,

32:50.502 --> 32:53.572
I DON'T KNOW, PICTURES
OF NAKED BOYS RIDING ON...

32:53.605 --> 32:55.674
UGH.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.676
I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

32:57.709 --> 33:00.246
CAN YOU BRING THE SINK
OVER TO ME?

33:00.279 --> 33:01.780
( chuckles )

33:01.813 --> 33:05.384
THIS DRESS IS FIERCE.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.053
SO FIERCE.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.720
I JUST LOVE THAT COLOR.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.157
I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.059
BUT IT MAKES
MY SKIN LOOK GREEN.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.161
IT WOULD LOOK
SO MUCH BETTER ON YOU.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.528
( laughs )
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.197
IT IS TRUE!

33:18.230 --> 33:20.699
OKAY, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.568
HEY, YOU KNOW,
DO YOU WANT

33:22.601 --> 33:24.436
TO ORDER, LIKE,
A PIZZA OR SOMETHING?

33:24.470 --> 33:27.539
YES, I WILL FIND US
SOMETHING NICE AND GREASY.

33:27.573 --> 33:30.542
I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
DON'T GO TO SLEEP.

33:58.604 --> 34:01.773
MM. SPARKLY.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.686
( retches )

34:41.179 --> 34:44.216
DAD, I'M SORRY
THAT I RAN AWAY.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.318
YOU REMEMBER
ALISON'S GRANDMOTHER,

34:46.351 --> 34:48.286
THE ONE WHO
MOVED DOWN SOUTH?

34:48.320 --> 34:51.257
I NEVER MET HER,
BUT, YEAH, ALISON
TALKED ABOUT HER. WHY?

34:51.290 --> 34:55.327
WELL, SHE PASSED AWAY
A FEW MONTHS AFTER ALISON
DISAPPEARED,

34:55.360 --> 34:57.596
AND THE DiLAURENTISES
NEEDED AN ATTORNEY.

34:57.629 --> 35:01.833
THE OLD LADY
HAD MONEY, A LOT.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.370
AND APPARENTLY,

35:04.403 --> 35:08.474
A WEEK BEFORE
ALISON WENT MISSING,

35:08.507 --> 35:11.177
HER GRANDMOTHER
AMENDED HER WILL,

35:11.210 --> 35:12.511
CUT JASON OUT OF IT.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.680
WHAT DOES THIS
HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?

35:14.713 --> 35:17.816
JASON'S PARENTS BEGGED
ME TO CHANGE THE DATE
ON THE FORMER WILL,

35:17.849 --> 35:20.686
THE ONE WHERE THE OLD
LADY LEFT EVERYTHING
TO BOTH GRANDCHILDREN.

35:20.719 --> 35:23.455
BECAUSE?
THEY DIDN'T WANT THEIR SON

35:23.489 --> 35:26.292
TO LOOK LIKE
THE NUMBER-ONE SUSPECT.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.694
THEY HAD A DAUGHTER
WHO WAS PRESUMED DEAD,

35:28.727 --> 35:31.563
AND A SON WHO
SUDDENLY LOOKED LIKE
HE HAD REAL MOTIVE.

35:31.597 --> 35:33.699
Alison: MY MOTHER POURS
 WINE IN HER CHILI.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.935
I BET SHE DOES.
WHERE'S THE VINEGAR?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.870
HOW MUCH OF IT
DO YOU NEED?

35:38.904 --> 35:41.473
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.
ANYBODY HERE GOT
A BUN IN THE OVEN?

35:41.507 --> 35:43.275
WHAT?
GRAM, GROSS ENOUGH?

35:43.309 --> 35:45.244
WELL, I'M JUST SAYING,
FOUR TABLESPOONS

35:45.277 --> 35:47.746
AND YOU GO
INTO SPONTANEOUS LABOR.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.449
HOW DO YOU THINK I GOT
YOUR FATHER TO EVACUATE?

35:50.482 --> 35:51.917
( laughs )
IT'S NO JOKE.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.785
TOM WAS TROUBLE
FROM THE START.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.755
IT WAS PASSING
A FROZEN TURKEY.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.424
PATRICK WAS JUST
THE OPPOSITE.

35:58.457 --> 36:02.394
HE JUST FELL OUT
LIKE A GUMDROP.

36:02.428 --> 36:03.695
WAS PATRICK YOUR FAVORITE?

36:03.729 --> 36:05.264
I DON'T HAVE FAVORITES,

36:05.297 --> 36:06.832
BUT IF I DID
I WOULDN'T TELL YOU.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.701
WOULD YOU EVER DISOWN
ANY OF THEM?

36:09.735 --> 36:10.969
YOUR CHILDREN?

36:11.002 --> 36:12.571
I DON'T OWN
ANYBODY.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.840
THERE WAS A WAR
THAT TOOK CARE OF THAT.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.308
READ A BOOK.

36:16.342 --> 36:17.843
BUT I'M CURIOUS.

36:17.876 --> 36:21.947
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU
TO REALLY CUT THE CORD?

36:21.980 --> 36:24.550
WHAT IF YOU FOUND OUT
THAT ONE OF YOUR GRANDKIDS

36:24.583 --> 36:26.485
WAS, LIKE, PLOTTING TO SELL
A FAMILY HEIRLOOM

36:26.518 --> 36:28.220
AND USE THE MONEY
TO BUY DRUGS?

36:28.254 --> 36:30.956
IF ANYBODY I WAS RELATED TO
WAS THAT DERANGED,

36:30.989 --> 36:35.361
THEN, YES, OUR FAMILY TREE
WOULD GET SOME SERIOUS PRUNING.

36:35.394 --> 36:38.530
ARE YOU WRITING
A STORY OR SOMETHING?

36:38.564 --> 36:42.668
YEAH. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.836
THAT'S WHY SHE WENT
DOWN TO GEORGIA,

36:44.870 --> 36:46.805
TO GET HER
TO CHANGE THAT WILL.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.607
WHO?

36:48.640 --> 36:51.743
ALISON. AND THEN SHE MUST'VE
RUBBED IT IN JASON'S FACE

36:51.777 --> 36:54.280
THE NIGHT THAT SHE DISAPPEARED.
THAT'S WHY HE KILLED HER.

36:54.313 --> 36:55.581
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

36:55.614 --> 36:57.316
AND BE VERY CAREFUL
WHAT YOU SAY.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.917
WE SHOULD BE GOING
TO THE POLICE RIGHT NOW.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.320
SPENCER, WE'RE NOT GOING
 TO THE POLICE ABOUT THIS EVER.

37:01.353 --> 37:04.256
WHY ARE YOU
PROTECTING JASON?
I'M NOT.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.924
YES, YOU ARE.
NO, I'M PROTECTING MYSELF.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.327
I COULD BE DISBARRED
JUST FOR TOUCHING THAT WILL.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.628
SO WHY WOULD YOU DO IT?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.397
WHY WOULD YOU BREAK
THE LAW FOR THEM?

37:11.430 --> 37:13.732
IT'S COMPLICATED.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.467
NO, WHY? WHAT DOES
THE DiLAURENTIS FAMILY
HAVE ON US?

37:18.537 --> 37:22.341
I THINK I'VE ANSWERED
ENOUGH QUESTIONS FOR ONE NIGHT.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.846
OH, MY GOD.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.781
I KNOW THIS PERSON.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.822
HANNA.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

38:10.856 --> 38:14.560
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.828
YES, I CAN,
IF MY DAUGHTER'S NOT WELL.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.698
KATE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
SHE SAID YOU FELT SICK.

38:19.731 --> 38:22.734
NO, I'M FINE, I JUST --
I ATE A BAD SHRIMP.

38:22.768 --> 38:25.337
AND WE'RE CONCERNED
WITH WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN DRINKING.

38:25.371 --> 38:27.806
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT THERE?

38:27.839 --> 38:29.408
IS THAT
ISABEL'S DRESS?

38:29.441 --> 38:31.076
TOM, I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THIS.

38:31.109 --> 38:33.612
LET ME SEE
THAT, HANNA.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.013
DAD, IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

38:35.046 --> 38:38.350
AW... HANNA.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.018
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T DO THIS.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.654
TOM, GO BACK --
MOTHER, STAY OUT OF THIS.

38:42.688 --> 38:45.524
KATE WAS DRINKING, TOO.
WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TO EAT.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.058
KATE IS NOT
DRUNK, HANNA.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.060
KATE IS POISED
AND ALERT

38:49.094 --> 38:52.063
AND JUST GAVE
A VERY TOUCHING
TOAST ALONE!

38:52.097 --> 38:53.565
BACK OFF, TOM.

38:53.599 --> 38:56.067
I THOUGHT WE WERE
PAST ALL THIS,

38:56.101 --> 38:58.604
BUT I GUESS
WE'RE NOT, ARE WE?

38:58.637 --> 39:00.606
YOU WOULD REALLY DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

39:00.639 --> 39:02.741
JUST TO MAKE SURE
THIS WEDDING
DIDN'T HAPPEN.

39:02.774 --> 39:06.545
YOU KNOW, I WOULD'VE WAITED
AND HURLED ON THE BRIDE.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.748
YOU CAN BOTH LEAVE NOW.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.083
I'LL SAY GOOD-BYE FOR YOU.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.854
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.

39:15.887 --> 39:18.690
SWEETIE, IT'S OKAY.
HE'LL GET OVER IT.

39:24.663 --> 39:27.533
MOM, DAD?

39:27.566 --> 39:29.034
IF WE'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT HELPING MIKE,

39:29.067 --> 39:31.136
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT EVERYTHING.
ARIA...

39:31.169 --> 39:33.605
MIKE HASN'T JUST BROKEN
INTO ONE HOUSE,

39:33.639 --> 39:37.008
AND I'VE KNOWN ABOUT IT
FOR A WHILE.

39:37.042 --> 39:40.679
I JUST KEPT IT TO MYSELF
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WOULD HELP HIM.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.450
BUT IT HASN'T.

39:44.483 --> 39:48.186
AND I'M TIRED
OF KEEPING SECRETS.

39:48.219 --> 39:52.057
I WAS ASKED TO DO IT ONCE,
AND IT ALMOST DESTROYED US.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.827
I DON'T WANT
TO DO IT ANYMORE.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.482
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

40:16.515 --> 40:19.084
TRYING TO FIND
A 24-HOUR CLEANERS.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.520
AW, HONEY, TRY TO FIND
AN UNDERTAKER.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.522
THIS THING NEEDS
TO BE BURIED.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.695
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ALONE.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.563
TOM SAID YOU WERE
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

40:31.597 --> 40:34.733
I AM... IN A BIG WAY.

40:34.766 --> 40:38.003
YOU FEELING BETTER?
I BROUGHT YOU
SOME GINGER ALE.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.872
IS THAT WHAT SOBERED
YOU UP SO FAST?

40:40.906 --> 40:43.742
EXCUSE ME?
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU--!

40:43.775 --> 40:45.911
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
GIVE ME THAT!

40:45.944 --> 40:47.713
THOSE ARE MINE.

40:50.816 --> 40:55.053
MAY I HAVE MY PURSE
BACK, PLEASE?

40:55.086 --> 40:59.057
LISTEN, GRANNY, IF I
WANTED TO PLAY AIRPORT --

40:59.090 --> 41:02.060
YOU THINK YOU'RE
PRETTY SLY, DON'T YOU?

41:02.093 --> 41:03.962
THIS ONE WAS
GUZZLING WATER.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.732
YOU HAD THE BAR
ALL TO YOURSELF.

41:12.538 --> 41:15.240
CONGRATULATIONS, KATE,
YOU SETTLED THE SCORE.

41:15.273 --> 41:18.009
BUT AS SOON AS I GET
MORE THAN SHRIMP

41:18.043 --> 41:21.613
IN MY STOMACH, YOU ARE
GONNA BE IN A WORLD
OF PAIN.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.849
WE'LL SEE.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.226
SHE SHOVED
YOUR HEAD UNDERWATER,

41:35.260 --> 41:36.662
AND YOU STILL DATED HER?

41:36.695 --> 41:39.565
GIRL, I CAME BACK
JUST IN TIME.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.933
SERIOUSLY, YOU DID.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.536
( phone ringing )

41:44.570 --> 41:48.607
UM, I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.
BE RIGHT BACK.

41:49.941 --> 41:51.810
DR. SULLIVAN?

41:51.843 --> 41:53.979
EMILY, I'M SORRY
 TO BE CALLING THIS LATE.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.047
CAN YOU GET AHOLD
OF THE OTHER GIRLS

41:56.081 --> 41:58.049
AND COME
TO MY OFFICE NOW?

41:58.083 --> 41:59.851
WHAT'S GOING ON?

41:59.885 --> 42:01.252
I KNOW WHO "A" IS.

42:04.623 --> 42:06.224
( message tone beeps )

42:17.035 --> 42:18.837
( message tone beeps )

42:24.242 --> 42:25.811
MM...

42:25.844 --> 42:27.646
( message tone beeps )

42:39.791 --> 42:41.326
DR. SULLIVAN!

42:42.794 --> 42:46.031
GUYS... WHERE IS SHE?

42:46.064 --> 42:49.100
OKAY, ARE YOU SURE
THAT SHE SAID TO MEET HER HERE?

42:49.134 --> 42:51.069
I'M POSITIVE. SHE SAID
MEET IN HER OFFICE.

42:51.102 --> 42:52.203
SO, WHERE IS SHE?

42:52.237 --> 42:54.039
SHE'S NOT HERE.

42:54.072 --> 42:57.142
( message tones beeping )

43:01.112 --> 43:04.650
"THE DOCTOR IS OUT. - A"
