00:00.078 --> 00:01.484
<i>Previously on This is Us...</i>

00:01.509 --> 00:05.602
You took the sourest lemon

00:05.627 --> 00:07.539
that life has to offer.

00:08.492 --> 00:11.367
and turned it into something
resembling lemonade.

00:11.779 --> 00:12.638
<i>I'm starting to feel like</i>

00:12.678 --> 00:14.578
you attaching yourself
to something that's not

00:14.580 --> 00:16.413
a calculated act is just too much

00:16.415 --> 00:18.081
for your empty human shell to handle.

00:18.083 --> 00:19.516
And that's our cue to leave.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.919
Where'd they go? Uh, they left.

00:22.921 --> 00:24.054
My car!

00:24.056 --> 00:25.288
Is that Sloane in your bed?

00:27.092 --> 00:28.925
Hey, Kate.

00:28.927 --> 00:31.228
- You're so pretty.
- Thank you, baby.

00:31.230 --> 00:34.297
Well, if I'm pretty, you're
pretty, 'cause we look alike.

00:34.299 --> 00:35.899
<i>I've got to get a handle</i>

00:35.901 --> 00:38.401
on myself, on the weight,
and on all of it.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.887
I need that more than anything
right now, and I want it.

00:40.912 --> 00:44.080
I want it more
than anything right now.

00:44.082 --> 00:46.149
Even more than me?

00:49.554 --> 00:51.187
You and William have known each other

00:51.189 --> 00:54.451
for Randall's entire life,
and you kept that from him?

00:54.476 --> 00:56.176
You kept that secret for 36 years.

00:57.689 --> 00:59.373
That must have been incredibly lonely.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.094
No. Not yet.

01:03.096 --> 01:04.596
I'll see you at Christmas.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.609
Did we overdo it?

01:17.611 --> 01:19.626
It's like a toy factory under there.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.727
I'm not really sure what
kind of message that sends.

01:23.752 --> 01:26.820
That we have three kids
and I work really hard.

01:26.822 --> 01:27.978
It's fine.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.454
Mom, are we going caroling?

01:30.470 --> 01:31.703
Yes, we will.

01:31.705 --> 01:33.204
Hey, Kate,

01:33.206 --> 01:34.305
stop counting presents.

01:35.141 --> 01:37.208
Mommy, my tummy hurts.

01:37.210 --> 01:38.443
I bet it does.

01:38.445 --> 01:40.211
I saw that open package of cookies

01:40.213 --> 01:42.814
in the kitchen that was supposed
to be for Santa's stomach,

01:42.816 --> 01:45.116
- and not yours.
- Pow, pow, pow!

01:45.118 --> 01:47.452
- Hey, stop horsing around!
- Guys.

01:48.455 --> 01:50.088
Mom, Kevin took my money from Grandma.

01:50.090 --> 01:52.223
No, I didn't. It's over
there on the table.

01:52.225 --> 01:53.958
Why do you even care?

01:53.960 --> 01:55.693
- You're too cheap to spend anything.
- Kev.

01:55.695 --> 01:56.928
When we're older,

01:56.930 --> 01:58.129
I'll be rich.

01:58.131 --> 01:59.397
And you won't have anything,

01:59.399 --> 02:00.998
and you'll have to live in a box.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.800
Enough money talk.

02:02.802 --> 02:04.936
You guys realize that
Christmas is not just

02:04.938 --> 02:06.804
about presents and
getting things, right?

02:06.806 --> 02:07.772
You guys know that.

02:07.774 --> 02:09.173
Hey, why don't you guys

02:09.175 --> 02:10.327
tell your mother what
Christmas is about, huh?

02:10.352 --> 02:10.842
Please.

02:10.844 --> 02:12.677
It's about Jesus stuff.

02:12.679 --> 02:14.912
"Jesus stuff."

02:14.914 --> 02:16.414
That's it. We are going to church.

02:16.416 --> 02:17.882
Probably a good idea.

02:17.884 --> 02:18.716
Yes. We're going.

02:18.718 --> 02:20.718
My tummy really hurts.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.687
Baby, that is not
getting you out of church.

02:22.689 --> 02:24.322
We'll go caroling when we get back.

02:27.260 --> 02:28.693
I don't know, babe.

02:28.695 --> 02:29.994
She-she's really burning up.

02:29.996 --> 02:31.829
Mommy, I'm scared.

02:31.831 --> 02:34.031
I know, baby, I know, but
everything's gonna be fine.

02:34.033 --> 02:35.032
I promise you.

02:35.034 --> 02:36.868
You're gonna be asleep,

02:36.870 --> 02:39.404
and they take out
appendixes every day here.

02:39.406 --> 02:40.938
It's like... pulling a tooth.

02:40.940 --> 02:42.073
But that hurts.

02:42.075 --> 02:44.475
Yeah, that was a terrible example.

02:44.477 --> 02:47.578
Um, can you stop for a second?

02:47.580 --> 02:49.313
I have an idea.

02:49.315 --> 02:51.048
Uh, everyone hold hands.
I'll be right back.

02:51.050 --> 02:52.784
Come on, guys, hands.

02:58.892 --> 03:00.291
Hey, baby.

03:00.293 --> 03:02.226
This branch-- do you see this branch?

03:02.228 --> 03:06.297
This branch has Christmas magic on it.

03:06.299 --> 03:09.700
Nothing bad ever happens
on Christmas Eve.

03:09.702 --> 03:11.402
Say it.

03:11.404 --> 03:12.770
Nothing bad happens on Christmas Eve.

03:12.772 --> 03:14.338
Now, I'm gonna hold on to this for you,

03:14.340 --> 03:17.241
and when you wake up,

03:17.243 --> 03:20.111
all of us are gonna be waiting
for you, and guess what.

03:20.113 --> 03:22.146
It's gonna be Christmas.

03:22.148 --> 03:24.015
- Okay. I love you.
- Thanks, guys.

03:24.017 --> 03:25.550
I love you.

03:25.552 --> 03:28.152
Thanks.

03:30.523 --> 03:32.423
Good Mommy.

03:36.095 --> 03:37.328
Yeah.

03:41.468 --> 03:43.234
- Okay.
- Kev?

03:43.236 --> 03:44.869
Bud?

03:44.871 --> 03:46.971
Kev?

03:46.973 --> 03:50.641
Hold on a sec, bud. Thanks, guys. Sorry.

03:50.643 --> 03:52.677
It's scary, but she's gonna
be okay, I promise you.

03:52.679 --> 03:54.245
I think we're gonna be
here for a little bit,

03:54.247 --> 03:56.581
so why don't I go try and
find us some good snacks.

03:58.117 --> 04:00.418
I worked in this
hospital 40 years.

04:00.420 --> 04:04.055
I know you have a stash
of decent blankets.

04:04.057 --> 04:05.556
Dr. K?

04:05.558 --> 04:09.494
I thought I recognized that voice.

04:09.496 --> 04:10.862
Oh, hey, you.

04:10.864 --> 04:12.630
Yeah, it's been a while.

04:12.632 --> 04:13.865
Nine years.

04:13.867 --> 04:15.933
Ooh.

04:15.935 --> 04:19.603
What's... happening?
What's all this about?

04:19.606 --> 04:23.708
I was rushing to get to the
airport, hit some ice.

04:23.710 --> 04:26.744
Wrapped my old LeSabre
around a lamppost.

04:26.746 --> 04:28.212
Ooh. How about you?

04:28.214 --> 04:29.413
You just come for the food?

04:29.415 --> 04:32.350
No. Uh, our little Kate...

04:32.352 --> 04:34.118
appendectomy.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.620
Oh, no.

04:35.622 --> 04:38.356
And on Christmas Eve.

04:38.358 --> 04:41.259
Well, don't worry about it;
it's routine stuff these days.

04:41.261 --> 04:44.061
Yeah, thank you. I know.

04:44.063 --> 04:45.630
Where is your family?

04:45.632 --> 04:46.597
They on their way?

04:46.599 --> 04:49.267
Uh, Montana; that's where we go.

04:49.269 --> 04:52.470
I mean, they're-they're trying,
but weather being what it is,

04:52.472 --> 04:55.139
they wouldn't get here in
time to say good-bye anyway.

04:55.141 --> 04:58.376
Good-bye?

04:58.378 --> 05:00.244
I don't, I don't really understand.

05:00.246 --> 05:01.445
You seem okay.

05:01.447 --> 05:04.081
Yeah, well... it's internal.

05:04.083 --> 05:07.418
A slow hemorrhage between
the heart and a lung.

05:07.420 --> 05:09.654
Can't they operate?

05:09.656 --> 05:10.888
Well, I'm sure they'll try,

05:10.890 --> 05:12.890
but don't let this flattering

05:12.892 --> 05:15.192
hospital lighting fool
you, Rebecca, I'm old.

05:15.194 --> 05:17.795
And the odds of digging around in me

05:17.797 --> 05:21.165
without causing either a
massive stroke or a bleed-out

05:21.167 --> 05:24.936
are close enough to zero to pass
for it in any math I know of.

05:27.073 --> 05:29.941
No, come on. Th-They're gonna fix him.

05:29.943 --> 05:31.075
I don't know, Jack.

05:31.077 --> 05:32.877
Who's Dr. K?

05:32.879 --> 05:35.980
Uh, he's the doctor who
delivered Kevin and Kate.

05:35.982 --> 05:38.049
If it weren't for him, we
never would have found you.

05:38.051 --> 05:40.651
So he's kind of responsible
for our family.

05:40.653 --> 05:44.755
And tonight...
we're gonna be his.

05:44.757 --> 05:47.658
Thank you.

05:47.660 --> 05:48.926
It's not just a coincidence.

05:48.928 --> 05:51.629
The only reason you delivered our kids

05:51.631 --> 05:54.231
was because our doctor's appendix burst,

05:54.233 --> 05:56.767
and now Kate's appendix
brought us all back here.

05:56.769 --> 05:58.636
On Christmas Eve, of all nights.

05:58.638 --> 06:01.339
You trying to wax poetic on me?

06:03.309 --> 06:06.177
I'd rather you wax that mustache.

06:06.179 --> 06:08.946
'Cause if your musings on
the great circle of life

06:08.948 --> 06:11.148
are gonna be the last
things I ever hear,

06:11.150 --> 06:13.084
dear God, take me now.

06:13.086 --> 06:14.352
You're not going anywhere, okay?

06:14.354 --> 06:16.354
Y-You're gonna be fine.

06:16.356 --> 06:19.156
And, Jack, I am very excited
that you became a doctor

06:19.158 --> 06:21.926
in the years since we talked,
but you don't have to say that.

06:21.928 --> 06:23.361
You said it so many times to us.

06:23.363 --> 06:25.396
From the looks of things, I was right.

06:25.398 --> 06:27.231
Yeah.

06:27.707 --> 06:29.540
Are you scared?

06:29.565 --> 06:31.198
Rebecca.

06:31.201 --> 06:32.200
Scared?

06:32.202 --> 06:34.803
Of the great beyond?

06:34.805 --> 06:39.174
Well, now, I-I am on quite
a bit of morphine here,

06:39.176 --> 06:41.343
so that does have to
be taken into account,

06:41.345 --> 06:44.379
but, uh... no.

06:47.751 --> 06:50.018
I guess I would say curious.

06:50.020 --> 06:51.987
I remember the first time I walked up

06:51.989 --> 06:54.556
on the edge of the Grand Canyon.

06:56.293 --> 06:58.160
It's been pretty well talked up,

06:58.162 --> 07:01.530
so my expectations were mighty high.

07:01.532 --> 07:04.900
But still, it, uh...

07:04.901 --> 07:08.235
it did not disappoint.

07:10.174 --> 07:11.439
Not a bit.

07:13.243 --> 07:15.343
Mount Rushmore I could take or leave.

07:15.344 --> 07:18.428
No, I mean it.

07:18.453 --> 07:19.713
If the great beyond
is no more impressive

07:19.716 --> 07:22.350
than the oversized mugs
of four old white men,

07:22.352 --> 07:25.153
hell, I can see that in
my Wednesday golf group.

08:23.347 --> 08:26.248
If I want to pray, which
one works the best?

08:28.852 --> 08:30.852
Well, in the end,

08:30.854 --> 08:33.121
I'd say they all get the
job done just fine.

08:36.025 --> 08:39.828
So the old man is
nearly gone at this point.

08:39.830 --> 08:41.162
And I'm there with his wife,

08:41.164 --> 08:43.298
and their kids are crying,

08:43.299 --> 08:44.899
you know, just waiting for the end.

08:44.901 --> 08:47.102
The guys says, barely above a whisper--

08:47.104 --> 08:48.737
I mean, you can hardly hear him--

08:48.739 --> 08:51.806
"Let me go. I want to go."

08:51.807 --> 08:55.909
Well, his wife is... in tears,

08:55.911 --> 08:57.544
and leaning over him,

08:57.547 --> 09:01.883
and she says, "Yes, go, my love.

09:01.884 --> 09:05.152
We'll be okay. You can go."

09:05.155 --> 09:07.889
The old man wheezes out, "No, I can't.

09:07.891 --> 09:09.624
You're standing on my damn catheter."

09:12.562 --> 09:13.961
Hey, sweetheart.

09:14.163 --> 09:16.053
Do you want to come in?

09:16.194 --> 09:17.327
I take it you're Randall.

09:17.329 --> 09:20.497
My dad said you're the
reason they adopted me.

09:20.499 --> 09:23.166
So thank you.

09:24.950 --> 09:26.249
Well, would you look at that.

09:26.251 --> 09:28.251
Aw.

09:28.253 --> 09:30.253
That is a fine snow globe.

09:30.255 --> 09:31.955
I love that.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.696
Thank you, Randall.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.499
But, you know, the only
thing I did that day

09:36.501 --> 09:39.402
was nudge a man in a direction
he already wanted to go.

09:40.672 --> 09:43.172
If at some point in your life,

09:43.174 --> 09:47.377
you find a way to show somebody
else the same kindness

09:47.379 --> 09:50.213
that your parents
showed you, that's, uh,

09:50.215 --> 09:52.281
well, that's all the present I'll need.

09:54.953 --> 09:57.320
But I sure do like this snow globe.

09:57.322 --> 09:59.789
Yes, sir. You know,

09:59.791 --> 10:02.792
I'll bet you that's just what
my Montana cabin looks like,

10:02.794 --> 10:04.026
right this minute.

10:04.028 --> 10:05.661
It lights up.

10:05.663 --> 10:07.597
It does?

10:07.599 --> 10:08.765
Come show me.

10:18.109 --> 10:19.876
Well, would you look at that.

10:19.878 --> 10:22.612
So it does.

10:22.614 --> 10:23.880
I'll be darned.

10:33.559 --> 10:36.457
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

10:38.488 --> 10:40.776
They can't cancel our play
on Christmas Eve. Who does that?

10:40.801 --> 10:41.917
What did you think would happen?

10:41.942 --> 10:44.576
Our lead actress vanished a month ago,

10:44.577 --> 10:45.862
off the face of the planet,

10:45.965 --> 10:48.425
rode away from your cabin,
so thank you very much.

10:48.498 --> 10:49.933
"Thank you very much"? What did I do?

10:49.973 --> 10:51.005
You got involved with her.

10:51.007 --> 10:53.040
You slept with the
Tony-nominated star of my play

10:53.042 --> 10:54.208
and ruined everything.

10:54.210 --> 10:55.710
Yeah, well, you know, I
slept with you, too.

10:55.712 --> 10:56.711
It didn't ruin anything.

10:56.713 --> 10:58.112
Yeah, only ten years of therapy.

10:58.114 --> 11:00.114
I came to New York
specifically to do this play.

11:00.116 --> 11:02.116
<i>My</i> play. And now, because
of you, I have to go

11:02.118 --> 11:03.718
to Hanukkah dinner at my parents' house

11:03.720 --> 11:06.152
and tell them and my perfect sister

11:06.184 --> 11:08.351
that the play isn't happening--
years of hearing that I'd never

11:08.352 --> 11:11.387
be a playwright, and then
finally I was, but now I'm not.

11:11.389 --> 11:14.089
I'm sorry, okay? Really, I'm sorry.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.824
- What can I do?
- Come to dinner with me.

11:15.826 --> 11:17.927
Oh, thanks, yeah, but I
have this Christmas Eve

11:17.929 --> 11:19.061
tradition thing I do at my brother's.

11:19.063 --> 11:20.462
No, I'm not really asking you.
You owe me.

11:20.464 --> 11:23.299
Why do you want me to come
to your family dinner?

11:23.301 --> 11:24.533
'Cause I told Mom I'm dating the Manny.

11:24.535 --> 11:26.969
That seems weird.

11:26.971 --> 11:29.204
Well, I'd just made the huge
mistake of sleeping with you.

11:29.206 --> 11:31.106
And then I was on the phone with my mom,

11:31.108 --> 11:33.108
and she was going on and
on about how I'd never

11:33.110 --> 11:34.610
make a living as a
playwright, and because

11:34.612 --> 11:37.212
our only other topic of
conversation is my love life,

11:37.214 --> 11:39.315
I said, "I'm dating the
Manny," just to shut her up.

11:39.317 --> 11:41.784
And so now I can't show up
with no play and no Manny.

11:41.786 --> 11:42.785
So you want me to pretend we're dating.

11:42.787 --> 11:44.553
Which is insane, I know.

11:44.555 --> 11:46.555
No. No, it's fine. Actually,
we did that storyline twice

11:46.557 --> 11:48.057
on the show. Come on.

11:48.059 --> 11:50.926
Great, that makes me feel a lot better.

11:52.496 --> 11:53.862
Oh, Kevin, anything else?

11:53.864 --> 11:55.431
Mm-mm.

11:55.433 --> 11:56.999
No, Mrs. Sandberg, I am all set.

11:57.001 --> 11:58.534
But, um, thank you.
Everything's been great.

11:58.536 --> 12:01.170
- Hanukkah, right? Crazy.
- We used to watch <i> The Manny.</i>

12:01.172 --> 12:03.138
- Oh, yeah?
- When did you ever watch <i> The Manny?</i>

12:03.140 --> 12:05.207
We watched <i> The Manny.</i> We loved it.

12:05.209 --> 12:07.176
Really? 'Cause I thought you
were too busy to watch TV.

12:07.178 --> 12:08.344
We watched <i>The Manny,</i> Sloane.

12:08.346 --> 12:10.045
- What do you want me to say?
- Well, I tell you what,

12:10.047 --> 12:11.547
I am happy that you did.

12:11.549 --> 12:13.082
- Thank you.
- Oh, me, too.

12:13.084 --> 12:14.350
I am so happy that you had time

12:14.352 --> 12:15.484
to watch <i> The Manny,</i>
but couldn't come see

12:15.486 --> 12:16.885
my play that ran for four weekends

12:16.887 --> 12:18.020
right down the street.

12:18.022 --> 12:19.221
Is that the one with the awful mother?

12:19.223 --> 12:21.590
It was you, Ma. It wasn't me.

12:21.592 --> 12:23.125
- She gave the character your name.
- How do you know?

12:23.127 --> 12:24.593
You were too busy watching
<i>The Manny</i> to go see it.

12:24.595 --> 12:26.996
- Can we be excused?
- After the reading.

12:26.998 --> 12:28.230
Uh, Paul, the <i> shamash?</i>

12:29.300 --> 12:31.533
Oh, Sloane, do the story.

12:31.535 --> 12:33.435
Kevin, you are in for a treat.

12:33.437 --> 12:34.903
- She tells it beautifully.
- Why is it always her?

12:34.905 --> 12:36.372
I can tell it beautifully.

12:36.374 --> 12:39.008
Honey, no offense, but you tell
it like it's a hostage video.

12:39.010 --> 12:40.209
I'm eloquent.

12:40.211 --> 12:41.410
Someone read the damn story.

12:41.412 --> 12:42.811
Okay, my little ones.

12:42.813 --> 12:46.048
So, many, many years ago,

12:46.050 --> 12:49.385
there was a Greek king who
ruled over all of Israel.

12:49.387 --> 12:50.853
And this king said,

12:50.855 --> 12:53.322
"You have to pray to the Greek gods,

12:53.324 --> 12:56.225
or you're gonna be in so much trouble."

12:56.227 --> 13:00.162
And the Jews were like,
"Yeah, I don't think so."

13:00.164 --> 13:03.932
And there was this one
man named Mattathias

13:03.934 --> 13:06.368
who had five sons and probably
some daughters, too--

13:06.370 --> 13:08.937
but we may never know,
because welcome to history--

13:08.939 --> 13:11.140
and one son named

13:11.142 --> 13:14.476
Judah Maccabee, who gathered
all of these fighters,

13:14.478 --> 13:16.011
and he called them The Maccabees

13:16.013 --> 13:18.147
because he got to name them.

13:18.149 --> 13:21.016
And they went against the king

13:21.018 --> 13:25.020
to get back the temple, even
though the Greek soldiers

13:25.022 --> 13:28.223
came in on giant elephants,
and I would have been like,

13:28.225 --> 13:30.959
"An elephant," and then just given up

13:30.961 --> 13:33.362
right then, but they didn't.

13:33.364 --> 13:37.399
The Jews rode strong until
the Greeks left Jerusalem.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.068
Yay, right?

13:39.070 --> 13:41.103
Except for when they
went back to the temple

13:41.105 --> 13:43.105
to light the menorah and clean up,

13:43.107 --> 13:44.807
they found that the Greeks destroyed

13:44.809 --> 13:48.177
all of the oil except for one jug.

13:48.179 --> 13:50.813
That's only enough to
light it for one night.

13:50.815 --> 13:53.315
But as God's reward

13:53.317 --> 13:57.953
for their loyal fighting,
he let that jug

13:57.955 --> 14:02.024
last for eight whole nights.

14:05.229 --> 14:07.563
- Why are we not doing that?
- What?

14:07.565 --> 14:08.864
It's like you and me, though, right?

14:08.866 --> 14:10.099
Nobody believes that I'm a real actor.

14:10.101 --> 14:11.900
Nobody believes that
you're a real playwright.

14:11.902 --> 14:13.902
- Who doesn't believe that?
- You, Ma.

14:13.904 --> 14:15.471
- Not true.
- Also me.

14:15.473 --> 14:17.506
See? No one believes. We have
to have faith in each other.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.241
Right? Screw these producers.

14:19.243 --> 14:20.909
We'll put this play on ourselves.

14:20.911 --> 14:22.478
What... what does he mean?

14:22.481 --> 14:24.147
Did something go wrong with the play?

14:24.148 --> 14:25.848
I'm sorry.

14:25.850 --> 14:27.249
Uh...

14:27.251 --> 14:28.884
They pulled the plug.

14:28.886 --> 14:30.352
- Oh.
- We don't have an actress,

14:30.354 --> 14:32.054
so we don't have a play.

14:32.056 --> 14:34.223
Well, maybe we do have an actress.

14:34.225 --> 14:35.958
Oh, no. Come on.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.326
No, no, no, you said

14:37.328 --> 14:39.027
- that you played the role before, right?
- No. No. Yes.

14:39.029 --> 14:40.896
- When I was workshopping it, I...
- That's great.

14:40.898 --> 14:42.898
Oh, you should have seen
her in <i> Guys and Dolls.</i>

14:42.900 --> 14:44.800
It was sixth grade; they're
still talking about it.

14:44.802 --> 14:46.235
Oh, Melvin, get the tape.

14:46.237 --> 14:47.769
- I want to see the tape.
- No, no.

14:47.771 --> 14:49.304
- Kevin, putting on a show is...
- Mm-hmm?

14:49.306 --> 14:51.173
...it's a huge amount of work.

14:51.176 --> 14:54.310
And money. I had a vendor try
to get me to invest in a show--

14:54.311 --> 14:56.445
<i>Wicked--</i> I said, "No way."

14:56.447 --> 14:57.513
And here we are.

14:57.515 --> 14:58.914
Huh.

14:58.916 --> 15:00.549
Listen, here's my point:
I don't care, okay?

15:00.551 --> 15:03.227
I'll put up my own money. We...
I have faith in us.

15:03.253 --> 15:04.519
I believe in us. Do you?

15:07.035 --> 15:09.169
What do you got to lose?

15:11.061 --> 15:12.861
- Okay!
- Yes!

15:12.863 --> 15:14.363
- Okay, yes!
- You want to do it? We're gonna do it!

15:14.366 --> 15:17.033
No, this is great. This is...
This actually happened once

15:17.034 --> 15:18.867
in <i> The Manny,</i> but you got to be
careful, 'cause we were engaged

15:18.870 --> 15:21.572
- by the end of season two, so...
- Oh, all right.

15:24.737 --> 15:26.771
This will be the
size of your new stomach.

15:26.890 --> 15:30.118
Aportion control is critical.

15:30.143 --> 15:32.944
In the beginning, you can only
eat about two ounces at a time,

15:32.946 --> 15:35.413
so you'll need to eat six small
meals throughout the day

15:35.415 --> 15:36.982
to get all the nutrients that you need.

15:36.984 --> 15:39.084
Is that a real egg?

15:40.888 --> 15:42.387
Um...

15:44.065 --> 15:45.931
There's no leeway in there.

15:45.933 --> 15:47.967
If you overeat or eat something that

15:47.969 --> 15:51.036
your new stomach can't tolerate,
you may get violently ill--

15:51.038 --> 15:55.107
shakes, vomiting, sweats,
diarrhea, fainting.

15:55.109 --> 15:56.609
Are you hearing all of this?

15:56.611 --> 15:59.445
I'm trying to, but someone
won't stop talking.

15:59.447 --> 16:01.113
And because you're not eating much,

16:01.115 --> 16:02.481
you have to watch the quality

16:02.483 --> 16:04.650
of your food to avoid malnutrition.

16:04.652 --> 16:06.418
You'll have to commit to a
vitamin and mineral regimen

16:06.420 --> 16:08.454
the rest of your life
or risk things like

16:08.456 --> 16:10.389
anemia, osteoporosis--

16:10.391 --> 16:12.258
diseases you would never think of.

16:12.260 --> 16:14.460
And I thought the surgery itself

16:14.462 --> 16:16.562
was the only thing I had
to be concerned about.

16:16.564 --> 16:18.731
It sounds scary, I know.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.599
But this surgery

16:20.601 --> 16:23.469
is actually a very positive
choice for most people.

16:23.471 --> 16:25.070
It's just part of my job to make sure

16:25.072 --> 16:26.171
everyone knows all the dangers.

16:26.173 --> 16:28.541
Well, you're very good at it.

16:30.244 --> 16:31.577
Thank you.

16:31.579 --> 16:34.413
And, because I know we're all
anxious to get out of here

16:34.415 --> 16:36.181
and start our holiday,

16:36.183 --> 16:38.450
I hope you have something
very fun planned.

16:38.452 --> 16:41.387
We do. We're gonna go to my son's house.

16:41.389 --> 16:44.189
Well, good. Uh, so, Kate, I just need

16:44.191 --> 16:46.325
a, um, a few more things
for your intake forms.

16:46.327 --> 16:47.993
Is that your current weight?

16:47.995 --> 16:49.995
Uh, y-yeah, pretty close.

16:49.997 --> 16:51.664
Okay.

16:51.666 --> 16:54.533
Ever take anything for depression?

16:54.535 --> 16:57.670
Prozac. But it made me
gain weight, so I...

16:57.672 --> 16:59.572
- What?
- What?

16:59.574 --> 17:02.174
I didn't know that you were on Prozac.

17:02.176 --> 17:04.443
- Yeah, well...
- Why?

17:04.444 --> 17:06.078
Because I'm not always jolly.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.313
And what about eating habits?

17:07.315 --> 17:08.614
Do you ever binge?

17:08.616 --> 17:09.647
- Yes.
- No.

17:09.650 --> 17:10.715
Mom.

17:10.718 --> 17:12.483
Okay, fine, when you were a kid, maybe,

17:12.486 --> 17:13.618
but I don't know why...

17:13.621 --> 17:15.119
Yeah. Also last month.

17:15.122 --> 17:17.323
Really?

17:17.325 --> 17:20.159
Yes, really.

17:23.598 --> 17:26.999
So, I hope you have a nice holiday.

17:27.001 --> 17:28.400
Thank you.

17:34.342 --> 17:37.543
We can run in and change,
and go right to Randall's.

17:37.545 --> 17:40.646
I already texted him. I
don't feel like going.

17:46.487 --> 17:50.089
There's usually Christmas
music on 101.7.

18:22.623 --> 18:25.224
Did I do this?

18:25.226 --> 18:28.093
I did, didn't I?

18:28.095 --> 18:29.528
With the food.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.534
I didn't know if I brought
up the food too much

18:35.536 --> 18:37.202
or I wasn't bringing it up enough.

18:37.204 --> 18:39.104
I never knew what to say, Kate.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.310
Did I do this to you?

18:45.312 --> 18:47.913
I don't know.

18:47.915 --> 18:50.649
Hey! Hey!

18:50.651 --> 18:52.418
Hey, I figured out the lights.
It was the breaker that...

18:52.420 --> 18:53.452
- Yeah.
- ...we never upgraded after

18:53.454 --> 18:55.154
we installed the trash compactor.

18:55.156 --> 18:56.622
All right, one second.

18:56.624 --> 18:57.623
Yes, okay, all right.

19:01.929 --> 19:04.296
You know what I want?

19:04.298 --> 19:07.299
I want one person to tell me
that I'm doing the right thing.

19:10.604 --> 19:13.038
Do you remember when you
got your appendix out?

19:13.040 --> 19:14.440
Yeah.

19:14.442 --> 19:16.675
And I remember being so scared.

19:16.677 --> 19:19.478
'Cause you were just
my little baby girl.

19:23.651 --> 19:25.451
What did you say to me then?

19:25.453 --> 19:27.453
Hmm.

19:32.660 --> 19:36.428
That nothing bad ever
happens on Christmas Eve.

19:37.598 --> 19:39.665
And I bet I liked it.

19:43.504 --> 19:45.671
Yes!

19:45.673 --> 19:46.739
For real!

19:55.366 --> 19:57.519
I saw a monkey
on the street one night.

19:58.963 --> 20:01.898
take me out there pretty late.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.267
But this night, there it was.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.836
It was on a side street,
just sitting there

20:06.838 --> 20:09.005
in a pool of light under a lamppost.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.607
Stared at me a bit,

20:11.609 --> 20:14.010
then ran on up between the
buildings, but first,

20:14.012 --> 20:17.747
with this look back at me like, "Mm-hmm.
You know."

20:19.484 --> 20:20.950
Now, I can't even say for sure

20:20.952 --> 20:22.485
if it was real, but like him,

20:22.487 --> 20:24.754
I knew in general, if you're
out on the street at 3:30

20:24.756 --> 20:26.856
in the morning, at some point,

20:26.858 --> 20:29.258
you realize you made a very wrong turn.

20:29.260 --> 20:31.661
So I stopped the drugs

20:31.663 --> 20:34.597
and learned to tame that
wildness from the inside,

20:34.599 --> 20:37.333
until I could eventually
walk in the daylight.

20:38.937 --> 20:42.638
That's why, when a man knocked
on my door one day...

20:44.576 --> 20:46.809
...I was there to open it.

20:49.681 --> 20:52.648
I don't know if it was from God or what.

20:52.650 --> 20:56.252
I did not expect God's grace,

20:56.254 --> 21:00.756
but now I had to open
myself to the pain of it,

21:00.758 --> 21:03.526
to feel the joy of it.

21:03.528 --> 21:06.596
And that's a word we use
around the holiday times: joy.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.799
'Cause the holidays are hard times.

21:09.801 --> 21:13.636
But tonight I'll go
back to my son's house,

21:13.638 --> 21:16.872
have Christmas with
his beautiful family,

21:16.874 --> 21:20.476
and stay up late enough
to feel Christmas Eve

21:20.478 --> 21:25.248
turn into Christmas Day, one last time.

21:25.250 --> 21:26.916
And you gave me that.

21:26.918 --> 21:29.452
And I want to say I'm grateful.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.520
And Merry Christmas.

21:31.522 --> 21:32.955
Thank you.

21:36.794 --> 21:38.527
Hello. I'm Jessie.

21:38.529 --> 21:40.963
Hi, Jessie.

21:40.965 --> 21:46.335
Uh, no monkey story for you, I'm afraid.

21:46.337 --> 21:49.705
Um, I do have one about a horse,
but it gets pretty filthy.

21:51.309 --> 21:53.609
About a year ago, I was in

21:53.611 --> 21:56.279
quite a good place.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.781
Thanks to diligence and these meetings,

21:58.783 --> 22:01.751
I had a grip on my various habits.

22:01.753 --> 22:04.487
And I, too, had met someone,

22:04.489 --> 22:06.789
at a time in my life
when I thought that bit

22:06.791 --> 22:09.725
of my heart could never
be stirred again.

22:09.727 --> 22:13.963
Uh, but then, that love went away.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.865
Rather, the object of it went away.

22:15.867 --> 22:19.602
Love itself was more stubborn.

22:19.604 --> 22:21.637
I thought he had died.

22:21.639 --> 22:23.572
Or been killed, or was in prison.

22:23.574 --> 22:25.207
I had no idea. He just left.

22:25.209 --> 22:28.210
And I had some very dark nights,

22:28.212 --> 22:31.480
nights that lasted for days at a time.

22:31.482 --> 22:35.751
And... and then I found out

22:35.753 --> 22:37.787
he was fine.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.689
No, he's more than fine.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.758
He'd found his own new love: his family.

22:42.760 --> 22:46.662
I wanted to be happy for him.

22:46.664 --> 22:48.297
I tried to be.

22:48.299 --> 22:51.000
But I was very, very bad at it.

22:51.002 --> 22:55.504
And so I turned to my old habits

22:55.506 --> 22:57.840
to chase away the
questions of how a person

22:57.842 --> 23:02.244
could behave in so inhuman a way.

23:02.246 --> 23:04.513
Oh, look.

23:04.515 --> 23:07.650
There is an animal in
my story after all.

23:09.754 --> 23:13.622
So now, to get better,

23:13.624 --> 23:17.827
I have to learn a new
skill: forgiveness.

23:17.829 --> 23:21.664
And so far, it seems I'm
also very, very bad at that.

23:21.666 --> 23:25.601
So I ask for your prayers...

23:25.603 --> 23:27.203
because...

23:27.205 --> 23:30.840
this group is the one
thing I <i> can</i> depend on.

23:32.610 --> 23:35.211
Hey, Randall, it's me.

23:35.213 --> 23:36.946
I'm gonna be a little
later than I thought.

23:36.948 --> 23:39.448
Just got to take care
of a little business.

23:39.450 --> 23:40.983
See you then.

23:42.954 --> 23:45.488
The monkey was real.

23:45.490 --> 23:46.789
I remember it on the news.

23:46.791 --> 23:48.924
Former animal trainer from the movies,

23:48.926 --> 23:51.494
had a pet monkey...

23:51.496 --> 23:53.262
got out...

23:53.264 --> 23:56.265
was recaptured.

23:56.267 --> 23:58.401
Well, that's some relief, I guess.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.373
Glad to see you're well.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.409
Am I?

24:12.850 --> 24:15.384
Christmas tree or Santa?

24:15.386 --> 24:18.422
Not much of an appetite.

24:18.447 --> 24:19.641
So it spread?

24:19.666 --> 24:21.266
Yeah, it's everywhere by now.

24:21.291 --> 24:22.824
- Prognosis?
- Poor.

24:22.849 --> 24:25.483
And you didn't think I'd want to know.

24:25.903 --> 24:27.369
I'm sorry.

24:27.707 --> 24:29.307
I came here tonight

24:29.332 --> 24:31.098
to tell you I'm sorry;
I knew you'd be here.

24:31.202 --> 24:32.768
Did you?

24:33.566 --> 24:35.399
I didn't.

24:35.401 --> 24:38.001
Three months ago, I didn't think
I would be anywhere tonight.

24:38.403 --> 24:41.705
I was so broken, I would visit
your crazy old neighbor

24:41.730 --> 24:43.396
just so I could hold your damn cat.

24:43.398 --> 24:46.366
I shouldn't have run off.

24:46.368 --> 24:47.800
Why did you?

24:47.802 --> 24:49.102
I wanted to spare you.

24:49.104 --> 24:50.370
Oh. Nice.

24:50.372 --> 24:52.038
How selfless of you.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.674
Okay, then spare me.

24:54.676 --> 24:58.678
I needed to say a proper good-bye.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.847
I was wrong not to give us that.

25:10.225 --> 25:14.460
So, are you dying tonight?

25:14.462 --> 25:16.195
Not at the moment, no.

25:16.197 --> 25:17.363
Tomorrow, then?

25:17.365 --> 25:19.732
Sometime after, I suppose.

25:19.734 --> 25:22.635
Well, then, I'll keep this very simple.

25:22.637 --> 25:24.270
William Hill,

25:24.272 --> 25:26.806
I loved you and you left.

25:26.808 --> 25:28.875
Now I'd like to spend

25:28.877 --> 25:31.945
whatever time you have
remaining together.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.316
Would you?

25:39.257 --> 25:41.197
I'm gonna
be a little later than I thought.

25:41.222 --> 25:44.009
Just gotta take carea little business.
See you then.

25:44.049 --> 25:45.482
Is everybody drinking enough?

25:45.484 --> 25:47.250
Randall Pearson.

25:47.252 --> 25:48.952
My father won't be at the house, either.

25:49.189 --> 25:50.922
Kevin and Kate canceled.

25:50.947 --> 25:52.580
Now William's got some business.

25:52.582 --> 25:54.282
Where the hell you
think he went, anyway?

25:54.284 --> 25:56.017
Acting all mysterious.

25:56.019 --> 25:58.353
I was just talking with some
women outside of the bathroom,

25:58.355 --> 26:00.588
and word on the street
is you bought a boat.

26:00.590 --> 26:02.290
Well, Andy Fannin was selling his.

26:02.292 --> 26:04.559
Uh-oh. You didn't already
get me a boat, did you?

26:04.561 --> 26:05.827
That's not funny.

26:05.829 --> 26:07.095
What are you gonna do with a boat?

26:07.097 --> 26:09.097
Sometimes a man just needs a boat, Beth.

26:09.099 --> 26:11.899
This boat is not a boat,
Randall; this boat is sadness.

26:11.901 --> 26:13.234
Bad name for a boat.

26:13.236 --> 26:15.069
When you get depressed,
you buy things, Randall.

26:15.071 --> 26:16.070
I'm not depressed.

26:16.072 --> 26:17.872
- Baby. Please, okay?
- Hmm.

26:17.874 --> 26:20.074
Your father is dying and your
mother was lying to you...

26:20.076 --> 26:21.609
I told my mother I understand.

26:21.611 --> 26:24.679
Understanding and forgiveness
are two very different animals.

26:24.681 --> 26:26.948
The adult in you is probably all good,

26:26.950 --> 26:28.916
but the little boy in you is still hurt.

26:28.918 --> 26:30.651
So I got him a boat.

26:30.653 --> 26:31.986
You're welcome, little boy.

26:31.988 --> 26:34.555
Hey, go find Andy Fannin
and un-buy the boat.

26:34.557 --> 26:35.790
Can't.

26:35.792 --> 26:38.092
Tyler's still giving out bonuses.

26:38.094 --> 26:39.594
All right, let's see if Linda Banks

26:39.596 --> 26:41.062
was naughty or nice this year.

26:41.064 --> 26:42.764
- That's just wrong.
- I know.

26:42.766 --> 26:45.767
He makes all of us come
here on Christmas Eve,

26:45.769 --> 26:47.502
just 'cause he doesn't have any family.

26:47.504 --> 26:49.470
Neither do we, now they all canceled.

26:49.472 --> 26:52.840
Hey. We have two little girls
at my sister's house, you know.

26:52.842 --> 26:55.476
- Unless you want to leave them there.
- No.

26:55.478 --> 26:57.445
- You know what I want?
- Hmm?

26:57.447 --> 26:59.881
I want it to go back to
the way it was before.

26:59.883 --> 27:02.517
Before I went and stirred everything up.

27:02.519 --> 27:05.253
Found William and opened the
door to everybody's drama.

27:05.255 --> 27:06.487
And bought a boat.

27:06.489 --> 27:07.722
I will go un-buy the boat.

27:07.724 --> 27:09.323
- Thank you.
- Okay.

27:09.325 --> 27:11.526
I'm gonna go find Andy Fannin right now.

27:11.528 --> 27:14.061
Just don't complain to me when
you want to hop over to Bermuda.

27:14.063 --> 27:15.296
- I will not.
- Don't.

27:15.298 --> 27:17.298
- I will not do that.
- Thank you very much.

27:17.300 --> 27:18.833
Hey, you know what?
The hell with it.

27:18.835 --> 27:20.468
Ho, ho, ho, everyone.

27:20.470 --> 27:25.106
It's gonna be a very green Christmas.

27:25.108 --> 27:26.441
Wow.

27:52.836 --> 27:54.435
Andy, hey.

27:54.437 --> 27:55.503
Randall!

27:55.505 --> 27:56.604
What is up?

27:56.606 --> 27:58.973
Uh...

27:58.975 --> 28:01.008
What are you
doing out here, man?

28:01.010 --> 28:02.877
Just taking a break, man, smoking.

28:02.879 --> 28:04.812
Oh. Didn't know you smoked.

28:04.814 --> 28:06.948
Yeah, I just, I just,
I just picked it up.

28:06.950 --> 28:08.516
Where are your cigarettes?

28:10.253 --> 28:12.353
Yeah, I forgot them.

28:12.355 --> 28:14.255
Ah.

28:21.498 --> 28:23.130
Everything okay, man?

28:23.132 --> 28:24.098
Everything's good.

28:24.100 --> 28:25.566
- Good.
- Yeah.

28:25.568 --> 28:27.602
Uh, I just wanted to talk
to you about the boat,

28:27.604 --> 28:29.237
but I'm not really a fan of heights.

28:29.239 --> 28:30.538
Is it okay if we go inside?

28:30.540 --> 28:31.606
Why don't you just stay right there.

28:31.608 --> 28:33.207
Okay. That's no problem.

28:33.209 --> 28:35.409
Just be cool, all right? I am cool.
You be cool.

28:35.411 --> 28:36.978
No, I'm cool. We're both cool.

28:38.348 --> 28:40.948
What's going on, man?

28:44.420 --> 28:47.788
You, uh, you were here,
uh, last Christmas?

28:47.790 --> 28:49.824
Yeah. I had to be, right?

28:49.826 --> 28:51.492
You remember Tina?

28:51.494 --> 28:53.127
That red dress?

28:54.264 --> 28:55.329
From Payables? Yeah.

28:57.267 --> 28:59.734
Yeah, that was, that
was a hell of a dress.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.273
Was it just the one time?

29:07.310 --> 29:09.277
Been most of the year.

29:09.279 --> 29:12.113
Okay.

29:12.115 --> 29:14.882
So, uh, things were bad at home.

29:14.884 --> 29:16.851
No, they were good.

29:16.853 --> 29:18.452
Catherine was good, always there.

29:18.454 --> 29:22.123
So I worked and she...

29:22.125 --> 29:24.825
she took care of me...

29:24.827 --> 29:28.563
and our family, our lives, and, uh...

29:28.565 --> 29:31.766
at some point, she just
went from, uh, uh, a wife

29:31.768 --> 29:33.334
to a teammate.

29:35.271 --> 29:37.238
And you don't have sex
with your teammate.

29:37.240 --> 29:40.374
You have sex with...

29:40.376 --> 29:41.809
with Tina from Payables.

29:41.811 --> 29:43.744
Hey, listen to me, Andy.

29:43.746 --> 29:45.379
You had an affair.

29:45.381 --> 29:46.480
You don't get it.

29:46.482 --> 29:47.515
Well, th-then help me out.

29:47.517 --> 29:49.817
Catherine's done.

29:49.819 --> 29:52.853
Well, yeah, right now
she's pissed at you.

29:52.855 --> 29:54.088
Randall, she filed.

29:54.090 --> 29:55.623
She-- it's broken. I broke it.

29:55.625 --> 29:57.291
For no reason.

29:57.293 --> 29:59.660
My wife, my best friend, is gone.

29:59.662 --> 30:01.996
My kid, gone. My career, gone.

30:01.998 --> 30:03.164
And I'm dealing with it all by myself.

30:03.166 --> 30:04.498
What do you mean your career's gone?

30:04.500 --> 30:05.866
It's increments, man.

30:05.868 --> 30:08.035
I found myself making crazy
trades, taking huge risks.

30:08.037 --> 30:09.236
I lost a lot of money.

30:09.238 --> 30:10.338
What's a lot?

30:10.340 --> 30:11.939
A lot. Mine and other people's.

30:11.941 --> 30:13.774
- Does Tyler know?
- He will.

30:13.776 --> 30:16.344
That's why I had to come here to
get the-the bonus, because...

30:16.346 --> 30:17.812
at least they'll have that.

30:17.814 --> 30:19.747
That's why you sold me the boat.

30:19.749 --> 30:21.048
Do not back out on me. I won't.

30:21.050 --> 30:23.017
- They need it.
- I'm not backing out, Andy.

30:26.689 --> 30:28.656
It wasn't till I was in the elevator

30:28.658 --> 30:31.626
I decided to do it here.

30:31.628 --> 30:34.228
It was just all the floors going up,

30:34.230 --> 30:36.263
and I, and I thought...

30:38.201 --> 30:41.769
"Yeah. This'll do the job."

30:41.771 --> 30:43.204
Hey, man, don't talk like that.

30:43.206 --> 30:46.874
No. I wasn't scared, Randall.

30:46.876 --> 30:49.710
Then I thought about the motel
room I got to go back to,

30:49.712 --> 30:51.445
and it scared the hell out of me.

30:51.447 --> 30:53.014
Decision made. Andy, stop, stop.

30:53.016 --> 30:55.750
Look, right now, you're just upset.

30:55.752 --> 30:58.419
Do I look upset?

30:58.642 --> 31:01.009
I'm clear. I'm clear as a bell.

31:01.011 --> 31:02.777
'Cause while I was here,

31:02.779 --> 31:05.914
building nothing,
Catherine built our life.

31:05.916 --> 31:09.517
Our family, our friends.

31:11.619 --> 31:13.352
And they all went with her.

31:13.354 --> 31:14.654
I'm your friend.

31:14.656 --> 31:15.884
Where do I live?

31:15.909 --> 31:17.175
Andy, I don't know where you live.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.899
Then shut up.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.118
You want my watch? It was my dad's.

31:26.142 --> 31:28.009
Good God, man, you made a mistake.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.543
And I know what it's like to think

31:29.545 --> 31:32.613
that you're not allowed to, but
you don't get to just quit.

31:32.615 --> 31:34.782
- Oh, you don't get it, man!
- What, Andy? What don't I get?

31:34.784 --> 31:35.983
You don't live in my world, okay?!

31:35.985 --> 31:37.118
- Your life's perfect!
- What do you...

31:37.120 --> 31:38.552
You have no idea.

31:38.554 --> 31:40.688
What are you talking about, Andy?
You don't know.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.324
You don't have a monopoly on pain, man.

31:43.326 --> 31:46.727
My father left me at a fire
station the day I was born.

31:46.729 --> 31:48.362
He just took off.

31:48.364 --> 31:51.432
But this year, Andy,
this year I found him.

31:51.434 --> 31:52.767
Okay?

31:52.769 --> 31:54.535
It took me 36 years,

31:54.537 --> 31:57.638
but I found him, and I forgave him.

31:57.640 --> 32:00.741
And my mother...

32:00.743 --> 32:03.110
She did some things, too.

32:03.112 --> 32:05.179
But she's still in my
life and she's facing it,

32:05.181 --> 32:06.781
just like he did,

32:06.783 --> 32:09.183
because there's always a chance
that things will get better.

32:09.185 --> 32:13.054
And your daughter-- what's her name?

32:13.056 --> 32:15.690
Chloe.

32:15.692 --> 32:17.391
Chloe.

32:18.895 --> 32:21.629
If you love Chloe hard,
she will love you back.

32:21.631 --> 32:25.199
That's the way kids work.

32:25.201 --> 32:27.101
And she will forgive you, Andy.

32:27.103 --> 32:29.103
But not if she can't.

32:29.105 --> 32:31.339
Like, if you make this the story...

32:31.341 --> 32:33.441
make this the night before
Christmas when her daddy

32:33.443 --> 32:35.910
spread himself all over
Second Avenue, then no.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.979
Right?

32:38.981 --> 32:44.118
It is your job, as her father,
to stay here until she is ready.

32:44.120 --> 32:47.021
And if you can't do that, Andy...

32:47.023 --> 32:49.824
Chloe will forgive you.

32:49.826 --> 32:51.792
I know she will.

32:53.062 --> 32:54.595
Hey, Randall, you ready?

32:54.597 --> 32:55.963
Hey, Beth, stop. Don't come out.

32:55.965 --> 32:57.698
Don't tell me to stop. What? You came...

32:57.700 --> 32:59.500
Pl-Please, not now! I'm just hav...

32:59.502 --> 33:00.668
We're talking... Andy, no!

33:00.670 --> 33:02.737
No, no, no, no!

33:02.739 --> 33:04.939
Randall, what the hell is going on?

33:13.282 --> 33:15.182
Did you...

33:15.184 --> 33:17.351
try to give him back the boat, or...

33:17.353 --> 33:19.387
No.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.427
Then why did you come out here?

33:26.429 --> 33:30.564
Because nothing bad
happens on Christmas Eve.

33:39.409 --> 33:41.542
Let's go get our girls. Come on.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.165
All right, little mamas.
Jammies on real quick

33:47.190 --> 33:49.791
so Dad can read <i>The Night
Before Christmas,</i> okay?

33:55.232 --> 33:57.566
You okay?

33:57.568 --> 33:59.234
Yeah.

33:59.236 --> 34:01.103
It's been a big night.

34:01.105 --> 34:04.873
A nice, quiet Christmas,
just the four of us--

34:04.875 --> 34:06.742
that's all I want this year.

34:06.744 --> 34:08.443
Mm.

34:08.445 --> 34:09.878
You think we overdid it?

34:09.880 --> 34:11.346
Always.

34:11.348 --> 34:12.614
Knock, knock.

34:12.616 --> 34:14.016
Ho, ho, ho.

34:14.018 --> 34:15.284
Hey. Hey.

34:15.286 --> 34:16.385
Thought you couldn't make it.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.853
Uh, yeah, we finished early, so...

34:18.856 --> 34:20.289
Hi. Beth, this is Sloane.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.590
Nice to meet you.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.525
- Sloane, let me take your coat.
- Oh, thanks.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.293
- Sloane.
- Thank you.

34:25.295 --> 34:27.228
Yeah.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.364
- And Sloane is?
- Jewish.

34:29.366 --> 34:30.599
Yeah, I mean is she...

34:30.601 --> 34:32.100
Oh, no. Um, uh, she's the playwright.

34:32.101 --> 34:32.494
Uh-huh?

34:32.518 --> 34:33.668
Yeah, she told her mom
that we were dating,

34:33.670 --> 34:35.771
so I had to do Hanukkah, and
I thought it would be weird

34:35.773 --> 34:38.206
if, uh, when I left, I
didn't bring her, so...

34:38.208 --> 34:40.542
Yeah, now it's not weird at all.

34:40.543 --> 34:43.110
- Maybe some wine will help that.
- Probably.

34:43.112 --> 34:45.112
- Yeah. Yup.
- All right. Thank you.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.451
- Hey.
- Merry Christmas.

34:49.453 --> 34:51.353
- You made it, too.
- Yes.

34:51.355 --> 34:53.889
Now, that is a beautiful tree.
What is that?

34:53.891 --> 34:55.389
Is that a Douglas fir?

34:55.391 --> 34:56.891
- We went artificial this year, but...
- Thank you.

34:56.893 --> 34:58.393
...a Doug fir, that's a classic.

34:58.395 --> 34:59.962
I hope it's okay we still came.

34:59.964 --> 35:01.730
Of course it is.

35:01.732 --> 35:03.866
Hi.

35:03.868 --> 35:04.933
Hey.

35:04.935 --> 35:07.202
Mom... Let me take your coat.

35:07.204 --> 35:09.972
- Sure, thank you.
- Sure.

35:09.974 --> 35:11.373
Grandma!

35:11.375 --> 35:13.775
Hi.

35:13.777 --> 35:16.578
Oh, Merry Christmas. I missed you guys.

35:16.580 --> 35:19.214
I think Grandpa might have a few gifts

35:19.216 --> 35:21.550
for you guys to open
tonight, if you're lucky.

35:21.552 --> 35:22.618
Merry Christmas. Come here.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.453
You, too. Hi.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.255
Let me take these from you.

35:26.257 --> 35:27.656
Sloane?

35:27.658 --> 35:30.092
This isn't a thing.

35:30.094 --> 35:32.160
- Hey, it's Santa!
- No, baby, that's not Santa.

35:32.162 --> 35:34.096
Santa doesn't come
until you fall asleep.

35:34.098 --> 35:36.131
Sure looks like Santa.

35:37.434 --> 35:39.201
Hey, Merry Christmas!

35:39.203 --> 35:41.036
You must be Tess. Here, those
are for you and your sister.

35:41.038 --> 35:42.437
There you go. Randall?

35:42.439 --> 35:43.505
Yeah. Yeah. Hey.

35:43.507 --> 35:44.706
Hey. Toby. How are you?

35:44.708 --> 35:46.909
- Oh, my God.
- Good to see you. Merry Christmas.

35:46.911 --> 35:48.010
Merry... Merry Christmas.

35:48.012 --> 35:49.544
- Is this okay?
- Yup. Yeah, yeah.

35:49.546 --> 35:51.146
Oh, h... uh, hi.

35:51.148 --> 35:53.215
- Hi.
- Toby.

35:53.217 --> 35:54.249
Merry Christmas.

35:54.228 --> 35:55.656
Wow, that is a nice tree.

35:55.681 --> 35:56.947
- It's Doug fir.
- Yeah?

35:56.972 --> 35:58.471
Are you, are you really here?

35:58.496 --> 36:00.196
Well, I just spent six hours

36:00.221 --> 36:03.155
in a middle seat on something
called Zoom Airlines,

36:03.180 --> 36:06.448
so I am as surprised as you are.

36:06.630 --> 36:09.264
Kate, I am here to take the first steps

36:09.266 --> 36:13.135
in overcoming our
insanity one last time,

36:13.137 --> 36:15.637
for both of us.

36:15.639 --> 36:17.139
Because it's Christmas.

36:17.141 --> 36:19.708
And because we're good together.

36:19.710 --> 36:20.943
I'm back on the diet.

36:20.945 --> 36:22.477
Not for you, for me.

36:22.479 --> 36:24.746
But also for you, so
that you'll be with me.

36:24.748 --> 36:27.449
I can live without pizza and cookies

36:27.451 --> 36:28.717
and potato chips and...

36:28.719 --> 36:30.485
whatever that brownie thing was

36:30.487 --> 36:32.821
that they were serving on the plane.

36:32.823 --> 36:37.559
The one thing I cannot live without...

36:37.561 --> 36:39.094
is you.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.368
Six hours in a middle seat
gives a guy plenty of time

36:46.370 --> 36:47.736
to prepare an entrance.

36:54.812 --> 36:56.611
Wise man, wise man, wise man.
Uh...

36:56.613 --> 36:58.013
- cousin, maybe?
- I don't know.

36:58.015 --> 37:00.115
And then, uh, the donkey talks.

37:00.117 --> 37:01.516
Or the... I might have that confused

37:01.518 --> 37:02.985
with a cartoon, actually.

37:02.987 --> 37:04.353
Yeah, you're better with a script.

37:04.355 --> 37:05.687
Yeah.

37:05.689 --> 37:08.423
- Hey, everybody, Merry Christmas.
- Hey!

37:08.425 --> 37:09.424
William!

37:09.426 --> 37:11.059
I... I brought a friend.

37:11.061 --> 37:12.627
- I hope it's cool.
- Oh, absolutely.

37:12.629 --> 37:14.029
Hey, I'm Randall.

37:14.031 --> 37:15.097
- Uh, Jessie.
- Nice to meet you, Jessie.

37:15.099 --> 37:16.498
Hey, make yourself at home.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.133
I'll be right with you guys.

37:18.135 --> 37:19.134
Yeah.

37:23.807 --> 37:27.342
In my row on the plane,
I was the little guy.

37:27.344 --> 37:30.145
Every part of my body aches
like death right now.

37:30.147 --> 37:32.280
Do you want to have sex?

37:32.282 --> 37:34.116
And I'm cured. You're a witch.

37:34.118 --> 37:36.151
- Yeah?
- Yup.

37:36.153 --> 37:37.319
Okay.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.891
How's that quiet Christmas coming?

37:46.897 --> 37:48.463
- There you go.
- Hey, did...

37:48.465 --> 37:50.732
did William ever mention a Jessie?

37:50.734 --> 37:52.667
Uh, not to me.

37:52.669 --> 37:53.902
I don't know who that is.

37:53.904 --> 37:55.637
I think it's like Roy at school.

37:55.639 --> 37:57.305
Who's Roy?

37:57.307 --> 37:58.640
The one with two dads.

37:58.642 --> 38:00.442
What do you mean two dads? I don't...

38:00.444 --> 38:02.444
Dad, Grandpa's gay.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.513
Or at least bi.

38:07.518 --> 38:08.817
What's that now?

38:17.528 --> 38:18.894
Oh...

38:21.398 --> 38:22.731
Oh, hi.

38:22.733 --> 38:24.099
Hey.

38:24.101 --> 38:26.435
Just giving Toby a tour
of your beautiful home.

38:26.437 --> 38:28.303
Must've been a long one,
the way he's breathing.

38:28.305 --> 38:31.373
Yeah, the... the architecture is, uh,

38:31.375 --> 38:33.075
is breathtaking.

38:33.077 --> 38:34.443
Oh, thank you.

38:34.445 --> 38:36.244
Your shirt's buttoned wrong.

38:36.246 --> 38:37.979
Oh. Okay.

38:46.390 --> 38:48.023
Mistletoe.

38:48.025 --> 38:49.825
And look at Randall.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.094
Oh, no, no, no, we don't
want to see that.

38:52.096 --> 38:53.528
Oh, come on!

39:01.071 --> 39:02.804
Oh!

39:04.842 --> 39:06.942
Come on, now!

39:09.646 --> 39:10.612
Oh.

39:11.882 --> 39:15.550
You guys know that name of
all of Santa's reindeer?

39:15.552 --> 39:16.985
You don't?

39:16.987 --> 39:18.520
Does Grandma know?

39:21.892 --> 39:24.159
There's Dasher,

39:24.161 --> 39:27.963
- Prancer, Vixen...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

39:35.572 --> 39:37.506
One, two, three!

39:37.508 --> 39:39.474
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

39:55.959 --> 39:59.671
The O.R. is prepped. We're
taking him to surgery now.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.674
Oh, my God.

40:45.676 --> 40:46.575
Randall!

40:46.577 --> 40:48.376
Call 911!

40:48.378 --> 40:49.945
Call 911!

40:53.417 --> 40:55.083
Be careful, be careful.

40:56.820 --> 40:57.953
Toby?

41:30.387 --> 41:32.187
Well, I'll be darned.

41:34.157 --> 41:35.190
Hi.

41:36.126 --> 41:37.959
Clear.
