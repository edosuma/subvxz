04:38.153 --> 04:39.393
Can we talk?

04:42.783 --> 04:44.694
Your boys need some schooling.

Who's that?
Why did he do it?

05:00.217 --> 05:02.128

06:46.948 --> 06:48.484
Put that in here.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.492
Son of a bitch!

06:55.582 --> 06:57.322
What an idiot...

06:58.460 --> 06:59.495
Douche...

07:01.004 --> 07:02.210
Why doesn't he listen?

07:04.758 --> 07:05.873
Asshole...

07:08.428 --> 07:11.841
Hey! Hey!

07:12.390 --> 07:15.473
Breathe! Hey!

07:22.317 --> 07:24.308
It's good to be in Seoul.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.569
Boss, we should make money
and buy a building too.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.274
That sounds good.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.702
- Yang-tae, get him!
- Okay.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.246
So damn far.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.339
Hey! We're here,
get out.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.506
- Don't kill me, please.
- We're here!

07:51.513 --> 07:53.504
Get out! Now!

07:55.684 --> 07:57.470
- Look around.
- Okay.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.437
- Is this it?
- Yes it is.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.311
Look at it properly
before I pull your eyes out!

08:09.322 --> 08:11.233
It's the right place!

08:11.366 --> 08:12.651
Boss!

08:13.159 --> 08:16.367
- No one's here.
- How could that be?

08:16.871 --> 08:19.453
Buddy, give your boss a call.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.581
- He's not answering.
- He's not?

08:29.926 --> 08:32.167
Then who'll pay your $100k debt?

08:32.386 --> 08:34.217
No, it's now $200k.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.678
What? You said $100k!

08:39.019 --> 08:41.476
Idiot, gotta add the travel cost.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.439
Don't be like that,
we're compatriots.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.606
Compatriots?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.443
We're compatriots apparently,
what should we do?

08:50.822 --> 08:54.155
He hates compatriots
more than anything.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.862
You play the compatriot card
for your debt?

08:58.163 --> 09:00.996
Those who don't pay back
are the worst.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.285
I'll pay you back,
please give me a discount...

09:06.796 --> 09:08.411
I'm begging you.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.288
Look at this bitch.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.925
Alright, I'll give you a discount.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.509
How's $10k per limb?

09:23.104 --> 09:27.643
That'd be a discount of $40k,
totaling $160k, good?

09:28.109 --> 09:30.475
- It's a steal!
- I'm so jealous.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.025
Please don't kill me,
i can't die like this.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.531
Listen to this guy!

09:37.202 --> 09:39.739
Why should I kill you?

09:40.038 --> 09:43.906
You can't die without
clearing your debt, got that?

09:44.459 --> 09:45.459
Yang-tae.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.501
- Let's give him a good deal.
- Right away.

09:48.671 --> 09:49.581
Please, sir...

09:49.672 --> 09:53.540
- Don't kill me...
- Hand out!

09:54.552 --> 09:55.632
Bite down hard.

10:00.475 --> 10:03.638
You missed,
that's a $5k discount.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.055
Come on, hold him down.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.937
- How could you miss?
- You try it then!

10:08.149 --> 10:11.562
Hold still, don't move a muscle.

10:13.863 --> 10:14.863
Do it properly.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.111
Missed again!
Are you blind?

10:20.912 --> 10:28.912
The outlaws

10:36.302 --> 10:40.636
geumcheon police

10:47.564 --> 10:49.270
here, drink one.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.856
- What?
- Take it, drink.

10:52.610 --> 10:56.444
Just speak your mind,
I'll be the mitigator.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.481
Jang isu ordered this, right?

11:00.618 --> 11:03.451
Why the hell did you
stab a man, asswipe?!

11:03.538 --> 11:06.575
If you don't spill it here,
you're a dead man!

11:07.208 --> 11:10.541
You attacked an officer,
you wanna take the fall?

11:12.714 --> 11:13.749
Answer me.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.216
Silent treatment, eh?

11:24.601 --> 11:25.716
Here, take this.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.426
- Byung-sik.
- Yes?

11:28.646 --> 11:29.681
To the truth room.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.017
To the truth room.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.275
What's this?

11:34.736 --> 11:36.567
It's yours.
Get up.

11:36.946 --> 11:37.946
What's this for?

11:38.781 --> 11:39.987
Come over here, this way.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.234
What's going on?

11:44.287 --> 11:45.993
Sit up straight, sit up.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.622
What are you looking at?
I'll crack your skull.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.455
- Byung-sik.
- Yes?

11:59.594 --> 12:01.835
Get up, get up.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.525
Let me ask you again.
Where were we?

12:17.695 --> 12:18.695
Hey!

12:19.697 --> 12:21.187
Who filed the pool hall report?

12:21.366 --> 12:22.947
The deputy came by earlier...

12:22.951 --> 12:26.318
Asshole, so you sent it
without my sign-off?!

12:27.163 --> 12:28.869
I'm sorry, he just took it...

12:28.873 --> 12:32.240
I went easy on you
for writing reports quickly.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.375
You wrote so much weird shit!

12:34.754 --> 12:39.088
Why did you mention that
i came from a golf course?!

12:40.718 --> 12:42.174
You're the death of me.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.714
I'm sorry.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.012
Pull your chair, make some room.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.969
What?
What's the matter?

12:49.102 --> 12:52.845
The geezers are getting nervous
because of the gang activities.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.062
I'm already busy as is.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.729
Shouldn't you take care of this?
Do I have to get into it too?

12:59.195 --> 13:00.810
Being a captain means shit.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.154
Byung-sik, grab the camera,
field trip time.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.157
Okay.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.107
A life full of shit.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.301
- Afternoon, sir.
- Where's your boss?

13:25.888 --> 13:28.800
He's not here, I'm serious!

13:32.395 --> 13:34.727
Feeling my boob, eh?

13:35.273 --> 13:37.764
Keep gambling, go on.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.156
He's really not here.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.903
- Who cooked this ramen then?
- Let's have a bite.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.030
Dammit! Wasted a trip.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.783
Well now, you were there?

13:57.587 --> 13:59.606
Isu gang boss
jang isu

13:59.630 --> 14:02.417
You didn't do what?
I didn't even say anything.

14:02.425 --> 14:06.259
- He was acting on his own!
- Look at this bald fuck.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.221
Buddy.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.515
Here.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.390
This is a Democratic country.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.851
You're an illegal alien.
Come here.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.974
Illegal, my ass.
I'm a legal resident.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.017
Come here.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.317
One.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.064
- Two.
- I don't believe this.

14:26.783 --> 14:27.818
Closer.

14:30.078 --> 14:30.908
Wait! Please!

14:30.953 --> 14:34.320
I told you not to cause stink,
I've fucking had it.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.830
Shit, your twins are busted.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.124
Come with me,
we got somewhere to go.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.713
Stop eating.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.798
Get on with it,
I'm a busy man! Go on!

14:55.645 --> 14:56.680
You first.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.770
Why me?
He started this.

15:00.191 --> 15:03.183
So you stabbed a man for it,
start now.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.359
He's got nothing to say.

15:05.363 --> 15:09.106
If your boys keep coming around,
I'll fuck them up for good.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.902
These guys are clueless.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.904
- Byung-sik!
- Yes, boss?

15:12.995 --> 15:14.781
We're cracking down
their shops today.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.828
I'm sorry.

15:18.835 --> 15:19.995
What an idiot.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.911
If you're sorry,
kneel and beg, asshole.

15:23.923 --> 15:28.587
- You fucking bitch!
- You're my fucking bitch.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.879
- I'm sorry.
- Your turn.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.091
With some sincerity.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.095
I'm sorry.

15:41.899 --> 15:42.899
Okay.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.940
- Byung-sik.
- Yes, boss?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.980
That poroid, give me that.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.234
It's called a polaroid.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.738
Buddy, sit closer,
ass-to-ass.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.040
One more.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.209
One, two, three!

16:02.879 --> 16:05.211
So photogenic.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.043
Take one each,

16:08.050 --> 16:10.712
and whenever you're pissed off,
look at this and chill.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.881
You're now family, you got that?

16:13.014 --> 16:16.927
Why are you compatriots
so desperate to kill each other?

16:17.393 --> 16:20.931
Become bffs, go to brunch,
and get hair done together.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.436
I'm off.

16:22.773 --> 16:23.808
Get out of here.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.016
Useless dicks.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.072
Let's go too.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.066
It's too tight.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.494
I heard you're bringing in
girls from China.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.573
No, they come find me.

16:41.584 --> 16:44.917
If you get caught,
I'll whip you, be careful.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.086
Pick up the bill.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.313
Yes, what is it?

17:07.818 --> 17:08.818
What?

17:17.912 --> 17:19.993
Your compatriot's here.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.341
Boss...

17:44.480 --> 17:45.765
Are you his boss?

17:47.525 --> 17:48.765
Who are you?

17:50.152 --> 17:51.733
Debt collector, of course.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.649
Your boy took out a loan
and he's 3 months late.

17:58.578 --> 18:02.287
Boss, I borrowed $30k
and he wants $200k.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.238
Shut your mouth!

18:05.543 --> 18:06.543
How much?

18:06.627 --> 18:08.083
It's $200k,

18:08.379 --> 18:12.042
but I took his wrist,
so it's $190k now.

18:15.303 --> 18:18.045
That's not right.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.509
You're doing god's work,
it's hardly enough.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.978
That should do.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.071
Do you know who I am?

18:40.536 --> 18:43.653
I'm just here to collect,
why should I know that?

18:52.173 --> 18:54.038
Is he nuts or what?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.599
Who are you?

19:06.395 --> 19:07.395
What?

19:07.813 --> 19:09.019
Son of a bitch!

19:09.732 --> 19:11.688
Speak up, cocksucker!

19:19.200 --> 19:20.781
Cut his arms and legs off.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.568
Okay, what about the debt?

19:24.580 --> 19:25.660
Collect, of course.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.533
Gil-su...

19:31.962 --> 19:33.122
My boy...

19:33.756 --> 19:39.126
Don't kill me, sir,
please don't kill me...

19:39.136 --> 19:40.136
Gil-su.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.429
You got a debt to pay.

19:50.940 --> 19:54.103
So, who'll pay his debt now?

20:03.577 --> 20:05.033
- Evening, sir.
- Welcome!

20:05.037 --> 20:06.197
Chunsik gang.
Garibong district Korean gang
welcome!

20:06.205 --> 20:09.725
Chunsik gang.
Garibong district Korean gang
- why's the elevator busted?
- We'll get on ti.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.700
Why are you asking
a busy man to come?

20:12.962 --> 20:14.623
Why're you so busy?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.955
- Did you have dinner?
- Yes, yes.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.797
- Sit down.
- Let go.

20:18.926 --> 20:19.585
Give me some water.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.322
Chunsik gang boss
hwang chunsik
people will mistaken you
for a model cop.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.883
Don't open that!
I'm not drinking.

20:26.016 --> 20:31.227
Did you sort the pool hall case
with the Chinese?

20:31.439 --> 20:33.304
You want a report now?

20:33.315 --> 20:36.148
Come on, I'm just a curious party.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.562
Are you dating a Chinese girl?

20:38.904 --> 20:40.565
What the shit?

20:41.365 --> 20:44.573
Bro, this is your favorite,
the blue one.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.744
- Blue, blue.
- That's not important.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.121
Come on.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.282
Take the cash.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.209
My business is down.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.914
You sure there's no problem?

20:59.925 --> 21:03.088
It's nothing,
so don't poke around.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.633
Those damn Chinese are knifing
in someone else's turf...

21:06.640 --> 21:09.473
That's why you need to
stay out of it!

21:10.352 --> 21:12.434
My throat's dry.

21:13.063 --> 21:16.305
I'm counting on you,
let's have just 1 drink.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.808
Hey, I'm still on the clock,
i can't drink!

21:18.819 --> 21:20.309
- It's very blue, blue!
- I'll have it later.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.061
I got places to go, I'm busy!

21:22.072 --> 21:24.063
- You're making me sad.
- I'm gonna leave.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.991
Come, line up.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.115
Boss, let me introduce
the new girls.

21:30.206 --> 21:30.945
Sure thing.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.242
- Good evening.
- Hello there.

21:33.584 --> 21:37.953
These 2 are new,
and our Ace, hearty.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.505
Time moves fast.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.210
It's already my clock out time.

21:46.597 --> 21:48.212
- Let's move down.
- Sit down.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.089
- At the head of the table.
- Do it right.

21:51.268 --> 21:54.305
- You drink so well!
- It's nothing.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.313
You don't get drunk?

21:55.481 --> 21:58.518
A man must hold his drink,
this is nothing.

22:00.778 --> 22:04.316
- He's a veal man!
- So veall

22:04.323 --> 22:05.779
veal? Real man?

22:06.617 --> 22:08.153
What do you do, baby?

22:08.202 --> 22:11.319
You know, I'm businessman.

22:19.755 --> 22:20.755
This way, please.

22:21.799 --> 22:24.381
- Dude, I got a good look.
- This place is pumping!

22:32.977 --> 22:36.140
Shit, baby!
It's bad!

22:36.313 --> 22:38.395
Wake up, baby!

22:38.399 --> 22:39.935
What? What? What?

22:40.442 --> 22:43.900
We got cops outside, shit!

22:44.446 --> 22:47.153
Cops? Why?
Why are they here?

22:47.241 --> 22:48.276
My head...

22:48.534 --> 22:52.402
I don't know, shit,
I'm fucked, you're fucked!

22:52.496 --> 22:53.974
- Go outside!
- It's too early to swear...

22:53.998 --> 22:56.410
- Go outside.
- Why are we fucked?

22:57.293 --> 23:00.330
Any description?
Did you see his face?

23:00.337 --> 23:02.168
I didn't get a good look at him.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.917
They just ran out of here!

23:04.675 --> 23:07.007
- So fucked! Let go!
- Very fucked much!

23:10.556 --> 23:11.716
14 missed calls

23:11.807 --> 23:13.638
I don't believe this!

23:13.726 --> 23:16.342
- Put it on.
- I said I won't drink...

23:25.154 --> 23:28.738
You idiot! You're late!
I was looking for youl!

23:28.991 --> 23:30.947
Sir, when did you arrive?

23:31.285 --> 23:34.277
- I was the first one here!
- I couldn't reach you!

23:35.873 --> 23:38.580
- Salute!
- They made a real mess.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.452
Shit, what's all this?

23:43.839 --> 23:44.839
Welcome.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.460
What happened?

23:47.468 --> 23:50.505
3 Chinese-Koreans,
they cut off host's arm.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.428
With an axe, no less.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.222
Jesus Christ...

23:56.644 --> 24:00.182
They're always causing shit
when we're on duty.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.602
Gather everyone,
all the girls, and staff.

24:03.692 --> 24:04.692
Okay.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.809
There were 3 of them...

24:08.822 --> 24:10.778
I knew something was
off about them.

24:11.617 --> 24:12.732
Have fun!

24:13.202 --> 24:16.990
I was at the counter,
my girl came out running.

24:17.831 --> 24:18.365
Hey...

24:18.374 --> 24:19.989
- What's up?
- What happened?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.661
Those bastards...

24:21.794 --> 24:23.330
- They hit you?
- Yeah, take a look.

24:23.337 --> 24:24.417
Let's go.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.412
- Which room?
- ♪1065.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.002
Hold still, damm it.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.213
Baby, that's enough!

24:32.221 --> 24:34.007
Girls, go outside.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.546
That's enough, stop.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.674
You had so much fun, let's chat.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.928
Fucking hoe, don't move.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.392
How dare you, fucker!

24:44.650 --> 24:46.231
Chinese bastard!

24:46.527 --> 24:49.439
You thought this was a brothel!

24:49.822 --> 24:52.484
You dirty horse fucking cunts!

24:53.283 --> 24:55.148
Stand the fuck down!

24:55.411 --> 24:59.825
I'll poke your eyes out!
Goddamn punk ass!

24:59.999 --> 25:02.081
This guy's crazy.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.585
Don't do it.

25:11.802 --> 25:13.667
Don't do it, cocksucker!

25:19.393 --> 25:21.554
Let's go, I'm bored.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.681
You're wasted.

25:28.736 --> 25:31.944
My apologies,
it's a good day for us.

25:32.740 --> 25:35.948
We'll finish this drink,
and go on our way.

25:36.535 --> 25:40.369
Chinese freaks, shut your mouth!

25:40.372 --> 25:41.737
Son's of bitches.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.330
Fucking numbnuts.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.787
Ratfucker.

25:53.761 --> 25:54.921
He's all yours

25:59.349 --> 26:04.013
motherfuckers!
I'll kill you all!

26:05.856 --> 26:06.856
Axe!

26:11.904 --> 26:14.065
Slimy bastard!

26:19.203 --> 26:21.285
I've seen a lot of bad drunks,

26:22.164 --> 26:23.449
they were different...

26:26.460 --> 26:30.874
They didn't say where they're from,
or where they'll go?

26:31.298 --> 26:32.959
One of the girls said,

26:34.134 --> 26:36.420
they had Chinese accent,
she didn't understand much.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.595
But she said they're from
gyeongsang province.

26:40.474 --> 26:41.680
What the hell...

26:42.059 --> 26:44.425
I was just at the hospital,
they messed him up.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.604
Bro.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.018
I'll take care of it,
look the other way.

26:50.984 --> 26:53.771
Are you a cop?
Stay out of this.

26:53.862 --> 26:56.569
But he's like family!

26:57.908 --> 26:59.489
I meant what I said.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.651
I'll call if I need anything.

27:02.704 --> 27:03.704
Okay.

27:07.793 --> 27:08.793
Come here.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.537
Send our boys and look into it.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.667
Right away.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.095
What about the rest?

27:22.558 --> 27:25.516
This is all,
we don't carry large amount.

27:26.353 --> 27:29.720
Then go make some money,
the debt won't go away.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.642
Don't forget why
i kept you alive.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.944
- Got it?
- I'll do my best.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.371
Where do you get your girls?

27:52.629 --> 27:57.589
We pay a Chinese agency $10k
and they send us girls.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.549
Any problems bringing them in?

27:59.761 --> 28:02.628
They're on invitation visa,
so, not really.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.968
Do everything that makes money.

28:05.726 --> 28:10.060
Kill or chop limbs,
if there's demand.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.974
Collect protection money.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.767
Isu gang won't let it happen.

28:16.361 --> 28:16.975
Who?

28:17.070 --> 28:22.155
They're from yanbian,
arcade and karaoke's their turf.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.529
Then we'll start from there.

28:31.793 --> 28:32.657
I understand.

28:32.753 --> 28:36.587
That was the lab, their prints
aren't in the database.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.296
Probably smuggled in.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.466
Hold on, stop!
What's this?

28:43.597 --> 28:45.508
- Isn't that you?
- That's you!

28:46.099 --> 28:47.384
Why were you there?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.591
That's totally not me.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.637
Look, the clothes aren't the same.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.184
Bullshit, I recognized you
right away.

28:55.275 --> 28:56.731
Of course not.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.771
Look for the suspects, will you?

28:58.779 --> 29:01.691
I found them,
but the quality's terrible.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.272
- That's them?
- Yes.

29:03.617 --> 29:04.857
Zoom into it.

29:06.453 --> 29:07.989
This is the closest it'll go.

29:08.455 --> 29:11.572
So proud of you.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.084
You're a model cop
to all your juniors.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.751
I don't know what you mean.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.541
- Gather around.
- What's up?

29:18.715 --> 29:21.548
Grease the boys
and find out who they are.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.461
Got it.

29:22.469 --> 29:25.632
Know your limits,
or don't get caught.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.762
I'm on the edge lately.

29:28.725 --> 29:29.840
Who is that?

29:32.521 --> 29:33.521
Son of al

29:34.731 --> 29:36.312
you gotta know something.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.685
How should I know?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.266
Then should I?

29:39.569 --> 29:42.151
You don't know about
guys who smuggled in?

29:42.239 --> 29:45.777
Why do you assume it's me?
I don't even go to bars.

29:45.993 --> 29:49.827
Watch your goddamn attitude.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.661
You ate one, get the bill.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.453
They're gyeongsang boys,

30:00.465 --> 30:03.127
if you don't catch them,
I'll take you in.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.000
That's batshit insane.

30:05.012 --> 30:07.048
Don't go insane,
just catch them.

30:07.889 --> 30:11.006
- Sir, let's move.
- How much is it?

30:11.268 --> 30:14.180
- $84 please.
- Pay him $84.

30:14.771 --> 30:18.730
- What's fucking $84?
- I got some take-out too.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.149
- 80, right?
- Yup, 80.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.403
807?

30:23.697 --> 30:26.359
Come on, dude!
Pay the kid!

30:26.825 --> 30:29.111
Here, $200.
Keep the rest.

30:29.703 --> 30:30.703
Thank you.

30:30.871 --> 30:33.908
See you, get out of my way.

30:37.711 --> 30:39.667
If you take his money,
I'll kill you.

30:40.630 --> 30:41.745
Here, this one's cold.

30:44.134 --> 30:46.420
What a scumbag!

30:52.893 --> 30:55.350
Look at their clothes!

30:55.520 --> 30:57.226
What's with the gasoline tanks?

30:57.814 --> 30:59.600
Afternoon, gentlemen.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.772
You're like yellow chicks.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.646
What's that?
Give me one.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.566
Did you hear about
the bar incident?

31:06.573 --> 31:07.925
- The one with the hand.
- Yes, boss.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.065
It's no joke.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.114
- The venom's dead.
- What the shit?

31:13.121 --> 31:15.578
- Well...
- Changwon!

31:15.665 --> 31:20.580
They're from changwon,
they took over his gang.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.665
You sure about this?
Don't fuck around.

31:22.756 --> 31:26.795
I'm sure, this is a premier tip.

31:29.096 --> 31:30.096
Alright, fine.

31:30.263 --> 31:31.423
Economy's tough lately...

31:31.431 --> 31:32.671
Shut your face.

31:34.184 --> 31:37.768
- Here, $300.
- Thank you.

31:38.855 --> 31:39.685
And then?

31:39.689 --> 31:42.055
- And what?
- That's all.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.978
I told you everything.

31:44.528 --> 31:47.190
Was there...
Anything else?

31:49.950 --> 31:50.950
Get out.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.485
Here, take this back.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.870
- Dong-gyun.
- It's locked...

31:57.874 --> 32:00.240
Then go out through this door!

32:00.836 --> 32:02.292
Say it again.

32:05.507 --> 32:06.507
What?

32:08.552 --> 32:11.965
No pictures please!
No pictures!

32:12.013 --> 32:13.173
Boss, over here!

32:17.811 --> 32:19.176
- Where?
- Move please!

32:19.646 --> 32:20.886
- This is it?
- Secure the areal

32:22.524 --> 32:23.980
it's all chopped up.

32:23.984 --> 32:24.894
It was found like this?

32:24.901 --> 32:27.734
Yes, the kids found it
while playing ball.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.069
Did you call the forensics?

32:30.323 --> 32:31.563
- Hong-seok!
- Yes?

32:31.575 --> 32:32.940
- Forensics!
- They're coming.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.693
They're taking pictures,
do your damn job!

32:35.787 --> 32:36.787
Yes, sir.

32:36.913 --> 32:37.902
Jesus...

32:37.914 --> 32:39.870
This is bad,
it's no ordinary murder.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.497
- Gather around.
- Yes, sir.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.629
Dong-gyun.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.290
These assholes are going all-out,

32:49.384 --> 32:53.218
we gotta get all the body parts
before anyone else do, okay?

32:53.472 --> 32:54.882
Scour every inch of this area.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.331
- Hong-seok, come here.
- Yes, boss.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.007
- As for you,
- yes?

32:58.018 --> 33:01.977
Go around and gather
these garbage bags

33:02.105 --> 33:03.641
with patrol officers.

33:03.648 --> 33:04.648
Yes, sir.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.184
Boss, I think it's venom.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.565
He's really dead.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.948
What are you doing?!
This is a crime scene!

33:15.911 --> 33:16.991
I'm sorry!

33:18.914 --> 33:20.279
That truck! Hey!

33:20.332 --> 33:21.913
Stop that garbage truck!
Go stop it!

33:22.000 --> 33:23.991
The garbage truck!

33:24.044 --> 33:25.079
What is it?

33:27.130 --> 33:28.130
What's up?!

33:29.508 --> 33:31.794
- Wait! Stop!
- Stop the truck!

33:31.885 --> 33:34.092
Stop! Stop! Stop!

33:37.349 --> 33:40.011
Police, we need to
go through your garbage.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.015
Sir!

33:45.398 --> 33:47.514
- Is this your route?
- Yeah.

33:47.817 --> 33:49.432
Sorry about this,
it won't take long.

33:49.528 --> 33:50.528
Sure thing.

33:51.863 --> 33:55.572
I'm at the crime scene,
the body's dismembered.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.576
- Stinks like hell...
- We got a garbage truck.

34:01.081 --> 34:03.618
No, it's not from the truck,

34:03.833 --> 34:06.950
body's not ided yet,
we only got an arm.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.665
I'll call you back!

34:09.672 --> 34:10.378
Found it.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.088
- You got it?
- We got it, sir.

34:30.025 --> 34:31.687
Brings the boys.

34:32.445 --> 34:33.445
Sure.

34:35.197 --> 34:36.197
Big money.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.491
Hit me! Big money!
Give me a hit!

34:43.081 --> 34:45.743
This machine's fucked!
Took all my money!

34:47.002 --> 34:49.083
What the fuck you looking at?!

34:49.170 --> 34:50.170
Where are you?

34:56.011 --> 34:57.045
What's going on?

34:58.430 --> 35:01.172
You cunt, you're a scammer.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.049
Give me my money back
before I smash these up.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.642
Play nice and fuck off.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.265
Say what?

35:14.988 --> 35:16.478
Son of a bitch!

35:23.121 --> 35:25.453
- Are you nuts?
- Yeah.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.866
I'm nuts, got a problem?

35:30.045 --> 35:32.627
- You're too loud.
- Sorry, boss.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.373
Who are you?

35:40.513 --> 35:41.878
Where's your boss?

35:47.729 --> 35:50.687
Who the fuck's this?

35:59.074 --> 36:01.030
You wanna go, is that it?

36:01.743 --> 36:04.485
The boss inside wants you.

36:04.871 --> 36:05.871
Venom?

36:06.122 --> 36:07.987
Aren't you...

36:08.500 --> 36:10.866
Up to date on current affairs?

36:15.757 --> 36:17.167
Look at this chump.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.626
Make sure they don't run!

36:21.638 --> 36:22.753
Yes, boss!

36:35.485 --> 36:36.600
Who are you?

36:39.656 --> 36:40.691
Welcome.

36:42.701 --> 36:43.907
Welcome, indeed.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.331
Sit down.

37:05.515 --> 37:10.134
A handsome fella.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.263
I heard you protect this place.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.316
And the mahjong joint too.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.735
You must be loaded.

37:21.948 --> 37:22.948
Sure.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.316
I won't touch that one.

37:28.538 --> 37:30.119
But I'm taking this place.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.456
You must be out of your mind.

37:35.128 --> 37:37.119
You're the axe guy
from the bar incident?

37:37.839 --> 37:38.954
It's already going around?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.421
You got a death wish?

37:40.842 --> 37:42.127
- Boss!
- Where you going?

37:42.302 --> 37:44.167
Rat fucking cunt!

37:45.513 --> 37:47.720
What should we do
with the boys outside?

37:48.224 --> 37:49.714
Pull that out,
you're a dead man.

37:57.150 --> 37:58.230
What say you?

38:09.913 --> 38:11.744
Don't come around here anymore.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.664
Got it?

38:19.255 --> 38:20.335
Leave.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.308
Let's go.

38:44.364 --> 38:47.948
A real case for once,
not a knife fight like others.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.651
Is this all?

38:52.121 --> 38:53.201
Yes.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.664
We even searched landfills,
but nothing else.

38:57.752 --> 39:01.415
These cuts here,
they're axe wounds?

39:01.673 --> 39:05.586
Looks like it
but why so many stabs?

39:08.513 --> 39:10.344
This cut was made
when he was alive.

39:10.598 --> 39:14.386
The skin dries when it was
cut while there's blood flow.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.053
Savages...

39:19.232 --> 39:22.315
Why during such a crucial period?

39:22.986 --> 39:25.193
- What's crucial?
- You know...

39:25.238 --> 39:27.650
I had a drink with
head of police affairs last week,

39:27.782 --> 39:30.114
I'm ♪1 on the promotion list!

39:30.243 --> 39:33.406
He told me to be
careful of everything.

39:33.830 --> 39:36.788
Is that really important
right now?

39:36.791 --> 39:39.123
I'm just saying,
because it's a big case.

39:39.252 --> 39:43.245
Let's bring them in quick,
they're just 3 guys.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.621
Easy for you to say.

39:46.342 --> 39:47.457
Let's go eat.

39:48.177 --> 39:48.757
Okay.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.093
Pathetic bastards.

39:51.264 --> 39:52.299
Go wash up for once.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.468
Give us some money, cap.

39:54.851 --> 39:55.966
Put it under expenses.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.096
My socks started rotting.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.686
We're at expense cap.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.597
Give the boy some money.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.392
Oh my head...
It hurts...

40:06.613 --> 40:09.400
Take care of it,
i left my wallet in the car.

40:09.449 --> 40:12.282
Bullshit, I brought your wallet.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.111
Conniving bastard...

40:16.331 --> 40:17.537
He's loaded.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.143
- Wait, my wallet!
- Credit card?

40:19.167 --> 40:21.408
Wait, what's that?
That's mine!

40:21.502 --> 40:23.663
Sons of bitches!
That's my gas money!

40:23.671 --> 40:24.706
- Thank you, boss!
- Your wallet.

40:24.714 --> 40:26.045
Give it back!
Give it!

40:29.844 --> 40:31.459
Goddammit...

40:31.763 --> 40:36.302
We're taking over this area,
pay us $1k a month.

40:39.020 --> 40:43.480
After paying rent
and expenses, I'm penniless.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.394
So you won't pay up?

40:45.485 --> 40:49.398
I got nothing to pay you,
money doesn't grow on trees!

40:49.739 --> 40:52.321
Son of a bitch!
You wanna go?!

40:52.450 --> 40:53.906
Are you nuts?

40:54.243 --> 40:56.359
When did you turn into
a gangster?!

40:56.412 --> 40:59.370
Pay up before I get violent,
got it?

40:59.374 --> 41:02.491
Let go of me!
I can get violent too!

41:02.502 --> 41:03.867
- Wanna go?!
- You bitch!

41:17.266 --> 41:19.882
If you're penniless,
you should die.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.943
Good work, buy yourself a drink.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.147
Thank you, boss.

41:37.704 --> 41:39.740
Good job.

41:54.554 --> 41:56.215
Close up and come home.

41:56.848 --> 41:57.963
Okay.

42:00.101 --> 42:03.468
Hey, get me a harbin beer.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.891
I gotta close.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.746
Does he treat you well?

42:37.138 --> 42:38.138
Hey.

42:45.438 --> 42:48.601
You shouldn't have an attitude
to run a business.

42:51.194 --> 42:53.059
Am I right?

42:54.197 --> 42:55.653
I better curve your attitude.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.909
Fine, I'll do it, let me go.

43:30.817 --> 43:31.817
Yeah, it's me.

43:31.901 --> 43:35.644
The Chinese-Korean gangsters
from changwon,

43:36.072 --> 43:37.357
any updates on it?

43:37.365 --> 43:40.528
I pulled up all reports on them,

43:40.618 --> 43:43.360
but it might be useless
since they're smuggled in.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.365
Who the hell are they?

43:45.456 --> 43:48.198
They're called
black dragon gang,

43:48.626 --> 43:50.116
they do anything
that makes money.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.368
Got any photos of them?

43:52.463 --> 43:54.920
A few security cam captures,
I'll send you those.

43:54.924 --> 43:57.290
- Yeah, that'd be helpful.
- Understood.

43:57.385 --> 43:58.716
Thanks.

43:59.679 --> 44:04.469
My informant told me
they're infamous in changwon.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.511
They lend money to
other Chinese-Koreans,

44:06.602 --> 44:09.685
and they chopped limbs
if debt wasn't paid back.

44:09.814 --> 44:11.930
That's insane.

44:12.024 --> 44:14.561
But they're all compatriots.

44:14.819 --> 44:18.186
I got baby skin,
but it's dry lately.

44:18.447 --> 44:19.653
Rub some of this on me.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.697
The triceps where I can't reach.

44:27.623 --> 44:30.160
Should I go get some
venom gang boys?

44:30.459 --> 44:34.247
Yeah, venom's Minion, get him.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.333
They got some new recruits.

44:36.340 --> 44:39.503
Then check for venom tattoos.

44:39.552 --> 44:40.552
I understand.

44:52.523 --> 44:55.185
- Want some eggs?
- Of course.

44:55.276 --> 44:56.015
Sure.

44:56.194 --> 44:58.059
Hong-seok, want some eggs?

44:59.071 --> 45:00.356
No, I'm fine.

45:05.578 --> 45:06.988
I got a shell, asshole.

45:07.663 --> 45:09.119
Peel it properly.

45:09.582 --> 45:10.788
My apologies...

45:12.627 --> 45:14.242
Why's the egg so dry?

45:15.838 --> 45:17.624
It's boiled egg...

45:18.549 --> 45:19.664
Right.

45:21.510 --> 45:23.466
Why did you
transfer here anyway?

45:23.638 --> 45:25.674
Others are begging to
work in the intelligence.

45:26.349 --> 45:28.305
Serious crimes unit is
the heart of police.

45:28.476 --> 45:30.137
Heart of police my ass.

45:30.311 --> 45:31.551
- Smuggled in through busan
- 5 previous victims

45:31.562 --> 45:34.224
- smuggled in through busan
- 5 previous victims
his degree's wasted here.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.769
So, how do you like it?
It's no walk in the park?

45:37.276 --> 45:38.276
No...

45:38.778 --> 45:40.518
This area is notorious.

45:40.613 --> 45:44.606
Show your badge,
they just smirk.

45:44.700 --> 45:47.908
They see a badge,
they start stabbing.

45:47.912 --> 45:50.699
He's still green,
it's all about experience.

45:50.790 --> 45:54.533
Eat it when it's cooked!

45:54.752 --> 45:58.040
- It's okay, this is beef.
- That's lamb, idiot.

45:58.714 --> 45:59.749
You got roundworms?

46:00.299 --> 46:02.460
Eat slowly,
there's plenty of food.

46:02.969 --> 46:04.175
Put some more in.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.211
- Put more in.
- Smells good in here.

46:08.808 --> 46:09.808
It's all yours

46:16.232 --> 46:17.347
what would you like?

46:17.441 --> 46:18.476
Lamb.

46:18.818 --> 46:20.604
That again?

46:20.611 --> 46:21.691
What?

46:21.737 --> 46:22.601
Okay.

46:22.613 --> 46:26.197
Don't look,
3 guys just walked in.

46:28.661 --> 46:30.617
I feel it, they're the ones.

46:30.788 --> 46:31.868
A plate of lamb skewers.

46:31.872 --> 46:32.872
Right away.

46:33.374 --> 46:35.160
Give us a large portion.

46:35.793 --> 46:36.793
Idiot.

46:45.469 --> 46:46.629
You like lamb?

46:47.138 --> 46:48.298
Of course.

46:49.849 --> 46:51.214
I don't like it.

46:51.475 --> 46:52.885
We eat it everyday.

46:54.228 --> 46:55.263
Want a drink too?

46:55.396 --> 46:56.396
Nope.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.395
Hey.

47:02.737 --> 47:03.977
Where's the toilet?

47:04.572 --> 47:06.092
- Dong-gyun, tail him.
- It's out back.

47:18.919 --> 47:19.919
I'll follow him.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.462
Don't do anything stupid,
just guard him.

47:24.717 --> 47:26.378
- Pour me a drink.
- Sure.

47:28.179 --> 47:29.385
Dong-gyun, approach.

47:33.684 --> 47:34.890
Could I borrow your light?

47:39.815 --> 47:43.683
I haven't seen you around,
where are you from?

47:44.862 --> 47:46.602
You wanna fucking die?

47:47.990 --> 47:49.526
Chinese?

47:50.326 --> 47:51.907
Byung-sik, block the door.

47:53.788 --> 47:54.743
So good.

47:54.747 --> 47:56.283
Wong-oh, come here, boy.

47:56.415 --> 47:58.701
- Bill, please!
- Coming!

47:59.001 --> 48:00.241
Where in China?

48:01.796 --> 48:03.957
- How much?
- $92, please.

48:08.511 --> 48:10.547
Go inside there for a minute.

48:11.263 --> 48:12.263
Okay.

48:31.867 --> 48:34.609
- Are you alright?
- Hong-seok!

48:34.620 --> 48:36.076
- Hong-seok! Hong-seok!
- Byung-sik!

48:39.333 --> 48:40.994
Call ambulance! Now!

48:41.168 --> 48:42.874
Hong-seok, it's okay!

48:47.883 --> 48:48.883
Move! Move!

48:56.100 --> 48:57.806
Come here!

48:58.686 --> 49:00.517
- Gone?
- He's gone.

49:00.896 --> 49:02.181
Goddamn!

49:02.982 --> 49:05.064
I'm gonna kill those fuckers!

49:06.193 --> 49:08.650
I told you to guard the door!

49:12.658 --> 49:16.071
You thought fucking him
would get you something?

49:17.204 --> 49:21.117
Don't leave home, got that?!

49:21.542 --> 49:24.249
Asshole! You didn't do shit
as my husband!

49:24.253 --> 49:25.253
What?

49:35.139 --> 49:37.221
Come at me!
I dare you!

49:37.516 --> 49:41.634
Useless bastard!
What have you done for me?!

49:41.896 --> 49:44.979
One lousy shop was all I got!

49:45.274 --> 49:46.274
Yeah?

49:48.861 --> 49:51.022
Stab me, go on.

49:53.157 --> 49:53.942
Who is it?!

49:54.074 --> 49:57.362
I live downstairs,
why're you so loud?!

49:57.453 --> 49:59.034
Fuck off, asshole!

50:02.958 --> 50:03.993
Motherfucker...

50:06.879 --> 50:07.879
What the fuck?

50:39.662 --> 50:43.575
Moving into my turf, eh?
You got brass balls.

50:44.416 --> 50:47.032
But why did you boys kill venom?

50:47.086 --> 50:50.374
- For not paying his debt...
- What debt?

50:50.464 --> 50:55.629
His man Gil-su lost a lot
gambling in changwon.

50:55.636 --> 50:58.093
So you chopped him up for that?

50:58.514 --> 51:01.051
That's some next level shit.

51:02.226 --> 51:03.226
Look here.

51:08.732 --> 51:11.690
Where are they now?

51:11.986 --> 51:16.855
I really don't know,
they're a suspicious bunch.

51:16.991 --> 51:18.447
I don't know anything.

51:18.784 --> 51:22.072
Right, why'd you know.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.836
Fucking hell.
Enough.

51:40.389 --> 51:41.879
Shit.

51:44.268 --> 51:50.980
You're a disloyal prick,
you just accepted defeat.

51:51.358 --> 51:52.598
Am I right?

51:57.114 --> 51:58.114
Mr. hwang...

51:59.325 --> 52:02.032
I'll kill him myself,

52:02.911 --> 52:04.617
please give me a chance.

52:06.582 --> 52:08.538
Just one chance.

52:14.298 --> 52:15.879
Police hospital

52:15.883 --> 52:16.542
which room?

52:16.634 --> 52:19.216
- ♪533, over there.
- Here.

52:20.804 --> 52:23.170
- Kang Hong-seok...
- It's a 6-patient room.

52:23.724 --> 52:25.055
- Hong-seok!
- Boss!

52:25.059 --> 52:26.970
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

52:27.227 --> 52:29.138
Hello there.

52:29.313 --> 52:32.555
- Your fiancée?
- Yes, this is det. Ma.

52:32.941 --> 52:36.058
- I heard so much about you.
- Likewise.

52:36.820 --> 52:39.027
I'm sorry about everything.

52:40.157 --> 52:42.193
What did the doctor say?

52:43.118 --> 52:46.702
He wants me here for 2 weeks
for potential infection.

52:46.789 --> 52:48.245
Give me that.

52:51.251 --> 52:54.368
Our department will cover the bill,
so don't worry about that.

52:54.421 --> 52:56.286
But we all chipped in too...

52:56.298 --> 52:57.788
- Boss, it's...
- Be quiet.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.085
No, we can't.

52:59.134 --> 53:01.170
Please take it,
it's a small gesture.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.256
Have some meals together.

53:03.639 --> 53:06.722
I'm pissing blood
doing your work, idiot.

53:06.975 --> 53:08.090
When will you come back?

53:11.313 --> 53:13.099
I thought about it a lot,

53:14.233 --> 53:16.645
I don't think
i can do this anymore...

53:17.486 --> 53:18.851
I'm sorry.

53:19.655 --> 53:24.194
Don't be, you idiot,
I'm sorry that you got hurt.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.780
I'm so scared...

53:28.789 --> 53:32.452
I tried to overcome it,
but I just can't...

53:33.127 --> 53:36.290
Everyone feels the same,
they just pretend not to be.

53:38.006 --> 53:40.122
After getting stabbed a few times,

53:40.467 --> 53:43.209
I freak out
whenever I see knives.

53:46.390 --> 53:48.255
Gonna go back to
the intelligence?

53:48.934 --> 53:51.767
Yes, I'd like to do that.

53:52.312 --> 53:54.553
Okay, I'll put in a word for you,

53:55.023 --> 53:58.015
so get plenty of rest while at it.

53:59.153 --> 54:01.769
It's okay, idiot!

54:01.864 --> 54:02.864
Go inside.

54:34.563 --> 54:35.803
Yo, byung-sik.

54:36.190 --> 54:39.148
Black dragon boys are quiet.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.190
I don't see any of them.

54:42.029 --> 54:43.439
Then...

54:45.324 --> 54:47.315
Keep an eye on jang isu's boys.

54:47.493 --> 54:49.154
They'll make a move.

54:49.620 --> 54:51.781
- Onit!
- Okay.

54:54.208 --> 54:56.369
- Wong-oh!
- Yes?

55:05.969 --> 55:07.300
Are you hurt?

55:08.138 --> 55:09.628
Because of me last time...

55:13.018 --> 55:14.133
Dammit...

55:14.686 --> 55:16.972
I can't see where I got hurt...

55:17.064 --> 55:18.929
You should go to the hospital.

55:19.191 --> 55:21.773
Forget it, idiot,
get me some soya sauce.

55:24.947 --> 55:27.029
Where you going?
I said soya sauce.

55:28.325 --> 55:30.566
This is great for bruises.

55:31.787 --> 55:34.278
What is it?
I don't want it.

55:36.959 --> 55:38.745
Punk, go easy.

55:39.586 --> 55:40.666
Easy, easy!

55:42.381 --> 55:45.168
- You're being a baby!
- You prick...

55:45.300 --> 55:48.963
- It's hot but it'll feel good.
- That hurts!

55:55.602 --> 55:58.264
- You like this job?
- Yes.

55:59.273 --> 56:02.390
- Did you meet mom?
- Yes, she's well.

56:02.651 --> 56:04.016
That's enough.

56:04.528 --> 56:06.860
Aren't you mad that she's
living with someone else?

56:07.322 --> 56:11.190
None of my business,
she has her own life.

56:11.994 --> 56:14.110
Good, that's one way
of putting it.

56:15.789 --> 56:18.576
You're all grown up now.

56:18.625 --> 56:20.490
I'm 15 already.

56:21.461 --> 56:22.576
Right.

56:23.255 --> 56:25.462
Then sit down, sit.

56:27.301 --> 56:30.464
Since you're an adult,
have a drink.

56:30.470 --> 56:31.801
You're making me drink?

56:31.805 --> 56:32.805
Sure.

56:33.432 --> 56:34.512
Hey, come back!

56:34.600 --> 56:36.966
- Have a drink!
- I don't want some.

56:37.227 --> 56:38.512
Come here, now!

56:40.397 --> 56:42.262
I'll give you something good.

56:57.122 --> 56:58.122
Cashing out.

56:59.917 --> 57:02.374
- You won big.
- No, I lost $100.

57:27.361 --> 57:28.361
Welcome, boss.

57:30.989 --> 57:33.981
Stupid, useless fucking dicks!

57:34.368 --> 57:35.983
Who did this?!

57:36.578 --> 57:38.239
Isu gang did this!

57:39.081 --> 57:40.321
Dammit!

57:41.333 --> 57:43.619
I'm gonna fuck them up!

57:43.627 --> 57:44.627
Boss!

57:45.128 --> 57:47.369
Big boss said to stay low
for a while.

57:47.381 --> 57:49.121
Shut your fucking hole.

57:53.011 --> 57:54.467
Yes, he's on the move.

57:55.555 --> 57:58.797
Stay close, you can't lose him.

58:00.894 --> 58:02.350
Sir, we got visual on jang isu.

58:03.689 --> 58:05.850
Heading to the market, okay.

58:06.775 --> 58:08.060
Idiots...

58:17.619 --> 58:18.950
Been well?

58:27.963 --> 58:32.457
Fucking rats,
you fucked around in my turf.

58:32.843 --> 58:33.923
Say what?

58:35.053 --> 58:36.088
Son of a bitch!

58:36.221 --> 58:37.836
Goddamn lunatic!

58:45.480 --> 58:46.515
Hey, hey!

58:50.736 --> 58:52.397
I caught those fucks!

58:52.529 --> 58:54.520
I told you not to
cause problems!

58:54.740 --> 58:55.740
Piss off!

58:56.158 --> 58:58.399
- Piss the fuck off!
- Go away!

58:58.410 --> 59:00.651
Cunt...

59:03.540 --> 59:06.907
We've met at the diner,
come over here.

59:09.296 --> 59:11.252
Drop the knife!
Lose it!

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.227
- Where did he go?
- Where is he?

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:10.558
Hey!

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:12.525
Where is he?

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:14.527
Come out!

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:19.613
- Come out, asshole!
- Dude! There!

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:24.067
- Look at this chump!
- Get back up here!

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:27.571
- It's too high!
- You stay right there!

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:33.911
- Don't go anywhere!
- Don't move!

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:36.209
- Stop!
- Le't's move!

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:38.707
Yeah.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.960
Boss, the cops got suk-rak.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.097
What?

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:46.305
We had a run-in with isu gang...

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:47.758
I'm sorry.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:51.473
Look at this carefully.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.226
This is you, right?

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:56.733
He said no.

01:00:57.362 --> 01:00:59.694
- Blind baldy...
- Sit up straight!

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:00.938
- Lying sack of shit...
- It's totally you.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:02.735
- Fucking rat...
- Hey, listen!

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:04.858
The boys you hang out with,

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.489
tell me where they are.

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.413
Then t'll ship you
back to China quietly.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:17.715
He doesn't know.

01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:21.003
- What should I do with him?
- You're something.

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:25.129
What did he just say?

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:27.843
Fucker...

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.642
- I'm a fucker?
- What a piece of work!

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:32.886
Wanna die?

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:37.645
Oh man, I'm so tired.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:39.104
Sit him down.

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:42.987
He wants a lawyer.

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:45.899
Words alone aren't enough
for this prick.

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:52.664
Okay, boys, get him a lawyer.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:53.281
Sure.

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:56.034
I'll get you a lawyer.

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:57.043
Give me a sec.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:59.709
I'm going out for a bit,
you're done for the day.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:00.421
I can go?

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:02.256
You may leave, good work.

01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:03.883
Grab him!

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:04.751
He wants a lawyer...

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.754
Yup, I heard you,
we'll take care of him.

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:14.595
This is tasey taser esq.,
say hello.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:21.435
Take a picture without his top
and put him in the cage.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:21.935
Sure.

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:23.608
- Get up.
- Let's go!

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.824
See? Your Korean's good.

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:31.946
- Has he talked?
- He speaks Korean.

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:35.949
Just spill it,
we're wasting time.

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:39.624
Fatass fuck!
You fucking boar!

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.003
Should I chop you up too?!

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.713
Hold still, asshole!

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.298
- Boss, go easy.
- He still doesn't get it.

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:49.216
It's okay, you're good.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.923
You're alright.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:53.595
What the hell, buddy?

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:58.604
Can cops do this?

01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.688
Yes.

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:02.775
To killers like you,
we totally can.

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:07.531
What should I do with you?

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:10.567
Do you take me for an idiot?

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:13.987
He's biting his tongue!

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:16.081
- Open his mouth!
- Towel! Get a towel!

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:18.537
Stuff his mouth!

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:25.420
Enough with this tough guy act!

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:30.128
Let's congratulate
Mrs. yook bok-ja's 60th!

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:34.595
My lovely son,

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:39.475
thank you for allowing me
to live comfortably in Korea.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:40.896
I love you!

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:45.815
Mr. jang, please come
and give her a piggyback!

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:47.229
- No way!
- Come on out!

01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:57.660
You did well, I love you.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.997
Let's all have some fun!

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.334
What a great day!
Everyone, get up!

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.753
Let's all dance!

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.472
Grab that bastard!

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:23.811
Son of a bitch!

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.836
Get that fucker!

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:16.742
Jang isu!

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:18.824
You bitch!

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:00.786
I told you to stay the fuck away!

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:02.952
Do you know who I am?!

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:06.785
I'm harbin's jang chen!
You fucking asshole!

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:23.844
This is a banquet hall
in garibong district, Seoul.

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:25.394
Caused this scene of chaos
by spraying a fire extinguisher.

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:29.311
A Chinese-Korean gangster
caused this scene of chaos
by spraying a fire extinguisher.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:34.571
Then a man wielding an axe
attacked several party guests.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:38.867
It was a fight between
2 rivals gangs.

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:42.453
Let's pack up.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.081
They're going all-out.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:47.579
What's the point
of serious crimes unit?

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.787
We're short-staffed,
and Hong-seok's out...

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.508
Is that why you couldn't
close this case?

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:57.965
- You know what I mean.
- Is that so?

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:00.339
I should've brought you
a full troop.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:04.301
- We really are short on men...
- I see, it's all my fault.

01:07:04.312 --> 01:07:06.894
No cooperation from
the shop owners too.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.975
Why the hell not?

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:16.771
Even if we deport these fucks,
they'll come back with a new ID,

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.983
locals are scared of payback,
nothing we can do.

01:07:20.078 --> 01:07:23.570
Did we ever need help
to work a case?

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:26.034
It's about arresting 2 fucks.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:29.997
If you had the time to talk back,
go and find these bastards.

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:32.541
- Are we jerking off here?
- Go and find them!

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:34.331
What's with you two?

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:35.957
Cap, a word outside please?

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:37.094
- You stay put.
- Let go!

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.262
Alright.

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:40.761
- Captain, be the better man.
- Pompous bastard!

01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:41.925
He's too much...

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:42.880
Say what?

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:45.053
What did you just say?
You son of a bitch!

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:46.267
Goddammit!

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:48.474
Jesus fuck...

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:51.063
- Be cool.
- Let go of me!

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:53.942
This unit's all fucked up.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:55.393
Let go! Let go!

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.065
I'll calm him down.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:01.820
What's with you?

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:07.246
Listen, do this properly
and you're a captain.

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.366
Honest to god,
I'll make it happen.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.950
I don't care about that,

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.874
we'll get the bastards,
so don't nag the boys.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.080
How was I nagging?

01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:17.457
Can't a captain push them?

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:19.049
Are we jerking around?

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:22.254
They haven't gone home
in 2 weeks, look at them!

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:26.140
You and I've been doing this
for 15 years, you know better.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.596
You think I like what I'm doing?

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:32.063
I get no support
but they breathe down my neck.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:35.604
I got it, stop trying to
be their boss right now.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:38.064
Go easy on the boys.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.528
Promotion is least of
my worries now.

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.024
- Cap!
- What?!

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:45.908
The chief wants to see you.

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:49.371
You're so dead, see you.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:51.411
He wants you too.

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:55.711
Why me?

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:57.167
- It's so much better.
- Yeah?

01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:00.006
- Salute!
- Come in, sit.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.011
You called me?

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:04.011
This is cpt. Kang
from Seoul Metro homicide.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:09.263
They're heading up this case,
cpt. Jeon and det. Ma.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:10.770
Hello.

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:13.011
Why's homicide here?

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:16.015
Your suspect is on
China's most wanted list.

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:18.439
I got an official doc
from China yesterday.

01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:20.232
His name is jang chen,

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:23.899
he was an enforcer
in a harbin gang.

01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:26.651
- About 300 men...
- Harbin?

01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:28.361
Why is he here then?

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:35.203
In 2000, his boss was arrested
and received death penalty,

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:37.127
and he smuggled in
via busan pier...

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:38.330
In any case,

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:42.921
this case is transferred
over to homicide, got it?

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:44.627
What? Why?

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.921
I got shit on by the commissioner!

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:47.843
At my age...

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:51.183
We're almost ready for a sweep,
and to hand it all over...

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.850
Should've done it earlier!

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.346
What have you done in 2 months?

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:58.942
Captain, you didn't brief him
on our operation?

01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:01.273
What?

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:04.564
- Oh yeah!
- That's why.

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:05.860
Chief, the thing is,

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:09.907
we were originally after 3 perps,
but their gang is bigger now.

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:11.905
We're trying to bring them in
with a mop-up op,

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:13.247
so we've been making
some preparations.

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:14.787
This guy's selling snake oil.

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.159
Buddy, be quiet.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:20.877
It's your chance to be
on the front page.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:23.003
- You think...
- Wait a minute.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:30.382
- So, how many arrests?
- Well, about... 5 or 6...

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.349
- 25!
- Yeah, 25!

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:33.968
- At least 25!
- 25 or more!

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.390
What did you say to me...

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:38.014
It was hard wrangling them up,

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:41.101
the op is ripe for picking,
give us time to harvest!

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:43.728
If we don't catch them,
I'll quit the force.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.820
Enough!

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:47.740
What!
Don't shout at me!

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.359
Sir, you heard him,
that prick said...

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:50.485
Buddy!

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.322
Look at this punk,
who are you calling prick?!

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:57.583
- What are you doing?!
- Let's calm down and talk.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:59.919
- I'll show you what I got!
- Come here!

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:01.548
Be cool!

01:11:01.632 --> 01:11:04.965
You bet your jobs on this!
Get them or you're done!

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:06.505
Okay, give us 10 days.

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:10.175
10 days it is,
starting countdown today!

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:12.174
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:15.552
- I never said I'd quit...
- Captain, let's have a word!

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:17.769
That's quite enough,
I'm sorry about this.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.355
Let's shake on it,
shake and make up.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:20.609
Tell your captain...

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:28.239
Coming to our home
and stirring shit up, eh?

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:31.655
What in the world?

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:35.371
Homicide captain has
jackshit for manners.

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:37.994
Looks like you won't
get the promotion.

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:41.210
It doesn't matter now.

01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:44.672
But how will you
catch 25 gangsters?

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:46.165
We'll get them.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.005
Talking is easy, huh?
Get them?

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.546
- Sure, you can get them.
- Sir.

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:53.844
- Thanks, bud.
- Here.

01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:55.599
How's your face?

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:57.718
It's getting better.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.391
You're free to come back.

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:02.982
Intelligence is boring,
sitting and typing all day.

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:06.228
I know a plastic surgeon,
call me if you need him.

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:09.231
He'll make you a new person.

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:11.278
If it's so good, you should go.

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:14.486
And you? Stretch my face
and you get you.

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:15.320
See you.

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.446
- Bye.
- Yeah.

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:24.079
100 guest rooms,
hostess bar in the basement.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.543
Cafe on the ground floor.

01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:30.505
Buffet restaurant on top.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:35.424
They've been like that for 3 months.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:39.477
They took over several others
by doing the same.

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:49.065
Mr. jang, if you get rid of them,
I'll pay you half a mil.

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:00.664
Have a great meal.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:04.327
- Not coming?
- I'm not hungry.

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:23.429
When can you begin?

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:26.349
No need to delay it,
I'll start right away.

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:31.195
But my estimate's off.

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:34.448
What do you mean?

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:37.576
$500k is too little.

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:40.696
I need at least $1m.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.037
A man should stick to his guns.

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:49.755
I won't change my mind,
the final price is $1m.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.463
Do you take us for fools?

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:59.049
$500k is a lot,
others will do it for a lot less.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:15.236
Mr. gwak, don't look at me
like that.

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:17.324
Got that?

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:20.361
I'll give you $100k advance.

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:25.700
Are you kidding?
I need $500k up front.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:28.787
It's our first deal,
i need insurance.

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:33.215
Take care of hwang,
and I'll give you the rest.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.674
Who's Mr. hwang?

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:39.718
He runs hostess bars
in garibong district.

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:44.636
I'm sure you know him,
you took his manager's hand.

01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:47.805
That's why I wanted you.

01:14:58.119 --> 01:14:58.824
Hurry up!

01:14:58.953 --> 01:15:00.318
What the shit?

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:05.739
Boss! We gotta move!

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.535
Fucking bastards!

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:38.283
Get him!

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:44.737
I don't believe this...

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:46.451
Who the fuck were they?!

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:49.544
Fuck you!

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:55.258
You bastard!

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:07.643
Who ordered you?!

01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:09.429
Who?!

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:13.645
Just kill me, fucker!

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:15.518
Son of a bitch!

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:21.691
Stand up straight.

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:27.038
Goddammit, I told you to
stay the fuck out of this.

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.041
What?

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:29.449
Where's hwang?

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:32.000
This is a bad time, leave us.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:34.621
Does he take me
for a bitch dick?

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.414
Come again?

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:39.876
I'm not in the mood,
so leave us alone.

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:46.469
Motherfucker.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:48.471
Fuck off.

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:52.514
Find 10 good men
and send them my way.

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:54.776
Dipshit!

01:16:55.694 --> 01:16:59.027
How dare you defy me?
I told you to stay put!

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:02.280
You tried to bury him
in broad daylight?!

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:05.947
Did you expect me to
stay down like a senile fuck?

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:07.695
He took my boy's hand!

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:09.162
So did you get him?

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:12.078
If you can't do it right,
then why bother?!

01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:14.251
And what have you been doing?!

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:16.496
I'll fucking whip your shit!

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:18.293
You know what I'm like!

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:24.007
I'll find peace only when i
get him and take his hand.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.686
Get 3 men to surrender tomorrow.

01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:33.554
Say what?

01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:36.729
One's going in for assult
and damaging public property.

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:39.560
And wear this stab proof vest.

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:41.817
Don't get stabbed to death.

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.067
Goddammit!

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:55.251
You fucking wear it!

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:08.760
I did my best,
but he should go to an er.

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:16.146
Thank you, I'll pay you later.

01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:17.233
I got it.

01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:18.735
Take care.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:32.784
You're hiding something from me.

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:35.825
What do you mean?

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:42.634
Get up.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:44.552
On your feet.

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:50.423
Did your hubby mention anything?

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:53.058
He didn't say anything...

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:55.681
Fucking bitch!

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:04.444
There are 2 things
i don't tolerate:

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:07.906
Stealing from me
and lying to me.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:13.287
For the last time,
what did he say?

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:17.283
I didn't know he'd do that,
that's the truth!

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:18.659
Who ordered him?!

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:24.753
Hwang's men came to
my home once.

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:25.958
Hwang?

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.505
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:34.426
we'll go over everything
in detail.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:35.801
- One moment please.
- Be quiet.

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:37.978
- Attention, please!
- Clap!

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:39.805
Attention, please.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:42.732
Thank you so much for
giving us your time today.

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:47.150
As you know, black dragon
is out of control.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.314
I know they've caused
a ton of grievance.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:52.359
That's why we plan to
arrest the entire gang,

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:56.747
but that requires
your cooperation.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.456
Please, hear me out.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:07.671
To be frank, we haven't ided
all of them and many are new,

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.720
so it's difficult for us
to keep track of them all.

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:13.681
So, if you could send us
even a tiny tip,

01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:16.892
we'll mobilize and
arrest them all...

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:19.728
How do you expect us
to trust you?

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:21.604
We always get backstabbed.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:23.102
What's the point?

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.692
Do you know what they're like?

01:20:25.779 --> 01:20:28.862
One mistake and they'll stab us.

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:30.739
Gathering like this
makes me nervous.

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:33.109
That's why they're
asking us for help!

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:35.781
I'm leaving!

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:36.789
Gentlemen!

01:20:37.624 --> 01:20:39.364
Why are you all so scared?

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:41.993
This is why you're
always victimized!

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:44.837
You little brat!
What'd you know!

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:46.872
Did I say something wrong?

01:20:47.718 --> 01:20:51.461
These cops want to help,
but you scurry away!

01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:54.175
Will you always stay as victims?

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:57.007
Will you continue to work
wearing stab proof vest?

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:02.396
I don't have money to buy one
and I have to work here!

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:05.231
I can't live like this!

01:21:06.236 --> 01:21:09.820
Stabbings everyday,
a person can't live this way!

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:15.075
I've been doing this
for 15 years,

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:18.779
and if we leave them be,
we'll only have more victims.

01:21:19.666 --> 01:21:24.205
They think they're above the law,
we gotta lock everyone up.

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:27.330
You're all my neighbors.

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:30.207
I'm a resident here,
you know that.

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:33.969
I'm trying to make this place
even a little safer,

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:36.258
so your cooperation is crucial.

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:44.393
They're dangerous, so stay away
and take their pictures.

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:47.729
Taking photos is the best way.

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:49.897
You didn't have to say anything.

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:50.568
Com here.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:52.813
I recognize one, but 2 are new.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:55.942
It doesn't have to be good.
Just one picture.

01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:56.953
I see.

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:09.963
- Looked into hwang?
- Yes.

01:22:10.968 --> 01:22:14.426
He comes to work
only on weekends.

01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:24.387
I better kill them all.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:37.984
- Anything else?
- No, boss.

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:43.322
- Collection?
- Not everything yet.

01:22:44.877 --> 01:22:47.914
- Take care of it soon.
- Yes, boss.

01:22:52.176 --> 01:22:55.168
You wanna close shop?
Pay up!

01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:56.885
What's with you?!

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:58.553
Those bastards...

01:22:58.765 --> 01:23:00.551
They take $500 to $1k.

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.716
They collect on different days.

01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:07.100
I didn't want to pay him at first,
but he threatened to kill me.

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:15.855
The guys here were
with the venom gang.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:19.025
They came to drink
at my shop often,

01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:23.074
and they'd smash things up,
it's unbearable.

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:27.915
They come by everyaay
to collect,

01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:30.081
they don't care
if we don't have money.

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:32.542
They're human trash.

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:39.800
They're collecting
eatlier and earlier.

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:43.056
If they keep this up,
we can't keep our shops.

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:48.888
The boss doesn’t come around,
just his minions come to collect.

01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:53.067
- Usually $1k at a time.
- Yanbian gang's turf...

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:57.230
- From garibong district...
- They ransacked my shop...

01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:59.314
They hangout at the arcade...

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:01.362
Black dragon gang boss jang chen

01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:03.243
why're there so many?

01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:05.905
They control the entire area,

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:08.957
one member takes over
as a manager,

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:11.035
and bring in his own men.

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:12.209
How many in total?

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:14.420
We counted 26 so far.

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:17.925
You were right on the money.

01:24:18.512 --> 01:24:21.003
It'll take a few days
to get everyone.

01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:23.555
We gotta get him in a day.

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:26.137
All of them in a day?

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:29.850
If the word gets out,
they'll flee.

01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:32.063
No, we don't have the resources.

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:34.015
- Evening!
- What brings you here?

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:35.312
We need a precise plan...

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.026
Hong-seok, you're hot in a suit.

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.485
Evening.

01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:39.901
Divide into 2 teams.

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:42.365
I'm talking here...

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:45.240
When are you setting me up
with a date?

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:48.705
Sir, can I speak to you
for a moment?

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.456
Sure thing, come with me.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:53.247
- Get some beer!
- Sure.

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:54.916
And jang chen... jang chen...

01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:56.834
Why isn't anyone
listening to me?

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:57.957
Have a leg.

01:24:59.136 --> 01:25:02.299
- I like bbq chicken better.
- There isn't any bbq...

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:04.342
- What is it?
- Well...

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:07.015
Chinese officers are
arriving next week.

01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:12.229
Homicide will be ordered to
take the case with them.

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:14.018
And take our hands off?

01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:15.064
Yes.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:18.105
It's a direct order
from the commissioner.

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:20.983
Your suspect will be repatriated.

01:25:21.283 --> 01:25:23.239
- Okay, off you go.
- Bye.

01:25:25.412 --> 01:25:26.412
Hey!

01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:29.200
What will happen to him
once he's sent back?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.367
He'll be tried,
death penalty, at least.

01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:44.386
Hey, stop!
You can't take him!

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:45.549
That's enough, it's all over.

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:47.047
This guy can't be sent back!

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:49.175
It's an order from the top!

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:50.975
These officers came
to take him back.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.640
- Take him away!
- Out of the way!

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:53.808
- What's with you?
- Grab him!

01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:55.938
That's enough, sir.

01:25:56.026 --> 01:25:58.108
- Don't make this into a thing!
- Let go of me!

01:25:58.195 --> 01:26:01.403
Fuck, I just wanna talk!

01:26:03.116 --> 01:26:04.116
Come here.

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:08.152
Listen carefully.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:12.406
If you tell me where jang is,
I'll put you in a Korean jail.

01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:14.833
You can come out
in a few months.

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:18.253
If you go with them,
you'll get death penalty.

01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:22.503
Think this through,
it's your last chance.

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:23.959
Bring him over.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.671
Boss, what's done is done.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.965
Hey! Hey!

01:26:33.313 --> 01:26:34.313
Get in.

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:37.230
- Straight to the airport.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.152
You'll get a trial,
but you're finished.

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:53.947
So don't get an expensive lawyer.

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:57.292
If you got money to burn,
give them to me.

01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:02.584
Stupid idiot.

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:07.093
Be careful.

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.222
Oops.

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:12.633
The deal went south.

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:16.557
It's better this way,
they weren't trustworthy.

01:27:17.441 --> 01:27:21.480
Why is it so hard
to find a distributor here?

01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:24.481
What distributor?

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:27.189
Why do you ask?!

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:30.154
Perhaps I can be
of service to you.

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:33.820
What exactly can you do?

01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:37.241
Anything you can imagine.

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:51.932
Take care.

01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:16.158
Call me when it's ready.

01:28:18.084 --> 01:28:20.700
Yes, I'll give you a call.

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.180
Let's move.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:41.225
Quick, get in!

01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:48.398
Did he bite?

01:28:49.032 --> 01:28:50.363
They do look the part.

01:28:50.367 --> 01:28:52.232
He's a real actor!

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:55.111
My heart was about to burst,
but I got it done!

01:28:55.121 --> 01:28:56.327
Very good, be quiet.

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:58.663
- Did you do good?
- Of coursel

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:01.662
- a small token of appreciation.
- Thank you, sir!

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:04.745
- We didn't do it for this.
- Gonna count it here?

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:06.246
Yeah? Then I'll take it back.

01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:07.543
What's with you?

01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:09.542
You didn't do it for money.

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:12.843
- Keep your mouths shut.
- Of course.

01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:16.097
It's so good!

01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:18.349
Why aren't you eating?

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:20.101
Eat plenty.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.186
So they let you go?

01:29:23.233 --> 01:29:26.725
Yes, they don't get checked
when they enter Korea.

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:29.276
But why'd those officers
ask you?

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:32.943
They haven't found
a distributor yet.

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:36.280
Were they really officers?

01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:40.364
I'm sure.

01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:42.449
The Korean cops couldn't do shit.

01:29:42.836 --> 01:29:46.749
You know those officers
smuggle shit on the side.

01:29:47.007 --> 01:29:48.998
We can make a shitload.

01:30:05.483 --> 01:30:07.474
You expect me to believe that?

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:18.444
- Yang-tae.
- Yes?

01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:21.492
Get the axe.

01:30:27.714 --> 01:30:30.126
This is a sample
from their shipment.

01:30:51.363 --> 01:30:53.149
They have 100kg of it.

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:57.529
They can't sell it in China,
so they want to sell it here.

01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:12.338
They want to meet you
to close the deal.

01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:18.378
We don't have the manpower,
not even close.

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:20.551
- Not eating?
- Yes, understood.

01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:24.638
- Seok-do, SWAT is no go.
- Then get the patrols.

01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:26.978
- What's that? Show me.
- It's a list of perps.

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:29.226
- Copy and hand it out.
- Yes, sir.

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:30.189
Gather around!

01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:32.855
Pick out as many
young guys as possible.

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:35.236
This can't leak
no matter the cost,

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.481
we have to get everyone
even if it takes all night.

01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:38.564
Got it, sir!

01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:40.532
- Read it over.
- Okay.

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:43.862
Dong-gyun can cover
siheung and ansan,

01:31:43.957 --> 01:31:45.413
and I'll take garibong
and daerim.

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:47.328
- Vehicles?
- We got...

01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:50.286
4 vans, 1 SUV,
divided into 3 units.

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:52.996
Incoming call!

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:55.423
- Stop! Be quiet!
- Quiet! Shush!

01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:59.510
Hold on.

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:00.931
Answer it.

01:32:02.517 --> 01:32:03.517
Hello?

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:06.430
I talked to my boss.

01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:07.852
Where should we meet?

01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:14.108
Chuwol hostess bar
near daerim station at 9pm.

01:32:14.279 --> 01:32:16.065
Understood, I'll see you then.

01:32:18.616 --> 01:32:19.526
And?

01:32:19.617 --> 01:32:20.777
They'll be there.

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:22.321
It's on.

01:32:22.454 --> 01:32:24.410
There's still a lot to prep,
let's get a move on!

01:32:24.414 --> 01:32:26.405
- Good work, eat up!
- Thank you.

01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:36.172
I should be coming here
to have fun.

01:32:36.176 --> 01:32:37.176
Hurry up!

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.833
- Let's move!
- Moving!

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.460

01:32:40.472 --> 01:32:41.461
We reserved room ♪7.

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:43.680
- Your people are gone?
- Yes, they've evacuated.

01:32:43.808 --> 01:32:46.766
We're getting jang tonight,
no mistakes!

01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:48.135
- Understand, sir.
- Yes, boss.

01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:49.306

01:32:49.314 --> 01:32:52.397
Don't get hurt,
and guard your positions.

01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:57.023
- Who are you looking for?
- Thunder, dragon.

01:32:57.489 --> 01:33:00.322
Thunder, dragon, you got guests!

01:33:02.452 --> 01:33:03.612

My arm's in!
My arm!

01:33:29.354 --> 01:33:31.766
You gotta open up
when an arm is inside.

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:36.853
Stupid bitch!

01:33:47.914 --> 01:33:50.701
Dude, I'm so nervous.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Me too.

01:33:55.672 --> 01:33:58.789

- Nothing so far.

01:33:59.259 --> 01:34:00.920
Intersection is clear.

01:34:22.198 --> 01:34:23.233
Target inbound.

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:24.908

It's been a while.

01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:57.824
Where's hwang?

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:25.059

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:30.617

01:38:53.386 --> 01:38:54.842

Your call cannot be connected...

01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:12.151
Bald ass fuck...

01:39:13.823 --> 01:39:15.063
What happened?

01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:18.783
Cops are ransacking everything.

01:39:18.911 --> 01:39:20.071
We gotta go!

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.711

01:42:32.063 --> 01:42:33.063

01:42:50.122 --> 01:42:53.410
It's me, the hotel job's done.

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.074
I killed hwang.

01:42:56.253 --> 01:42:57.288
Yes.

01:42:57.338 --> 01:43:01.752
I gotta fly out to China now,

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:07.219

01:43:08.974 --> 01:43:10.464

01:43:12.645 --> 01:43:14.601
Okay, where?

I want it in Chinese bills.

01:44:21.797 --> 01:44:24.038
Mr. gwak from siheung.

01:44:24.175 --> 01:44:26.257
He's con man who's
building a hotel.

01:44:26.343 --> 01:44:30.632
He got jang to destroy my shop.

01:44:31.432 --> 01:44:33.138
He came to your shop?

01:44:33.392 --> 01:44:35.007

01:44:35.019 --> 01:44:36.179

01:44:53.245 --> 01:44:54.701
That fucker...

01:44:55.289 --> 01:44:57.826
He told me to give up my hotel.

01:44:58.209 --> 01:45:00.120
That bastard gwak...

01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:03.252
- He was quiet for a while...
- I gotta go.

01:45:08.928 --> 01:45:09.928
Mister!

01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:12.337

01:45:13.891 --> 01:45:14.891
What's going on?

01:45:14.934 --> 01:45:18.301
Sir, are you alright?!

01:45:20.397 --> 01:45:22.683
Hey! Goddammit!

01:45:23.943 --> 01:45:24.978
Wong-oh!

01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:26.900
Wong-oh!

01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:29.687
Fucking hell!

01:45:31.367 --> 01:45:33.403
Wong-oh, wake up!
Wong-oh!

01:45:33.744 --> 01:45:35.484
Goddammit!

01:45:42.378 --> 01:45:43.914
Hold on, kiddo.

01:45:44.296 --> 01:45:46.708
These men will
take care of you, okay?

01:45:47.508 --> 01:45:50.295
- Mr. ma...
- I'm right here.

01:45:51.637 --> 01:45:53.798
- China...
- What?

01:45:54.682 --> 01:45:56.968
He's leaving for China.

01:45:57.560 --> 01:45:59.050
China...

01:46:01.355 --> 01:46:02.470
I got it.

01:46:03.357 --> 01:46:04.893
I'll catch him.

01:46:07.069 --> 01:46:08.354
Get a move on!

01:46:21.250 --> 01:46:22.250
Hwang.

01:46:22.543 --> 01:46:26.206
Gwak that you mentioned,
where is this fucker?

01:46:26.839 --> 01:46:29.046
Shit, I don't know!

01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:31.544
He went out on a rampage
without telling us first.

01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:35.882
I confirmed that
he attacked hwang's shop.

01:46:36.473 --> 01:46:39.180
I'm on the way,
so have the money ready.

01:46:39.393 --> 01:46:41.554
- I'm not paying him.
- What?

01:46:42.187 --> 01:46:43.302
You take me for a fool?

01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:45.804
How will you handle
the backlash?

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:48.853
I never intended to pay
that gangster.

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:50.320
Mr. gwak!

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.360
Get him!

01:46:58.454 --> 01:46:59.454
Let go!

01:46:59.705 --> 01:47:02.412
Let me go, you fuckers!

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:49.368
Mr. jang.

01:47:50.798 --> 01:47:53.380
You can't just do whatever.

01:47:56.178 --> 01:47:57.178
What's this?

01:47:57.221 --> 01:47:59.132
Your money, $900k.

01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:03.682
Are you trying to fuck me?!

01:48:04.395 --> 01:48:06.602
How will you get on a plane
with cash?

01:48:06.897 --> 01:48:09.889
You can withdrawal anywhere
with that.

01:48:09.984 --> 01:48:11.349
I don't believe youl!

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.440
I'm serious!

01:48:27.918 --> 01:48:30.534
If you're lying to me,
you're a dead man!

01:48:30.713 --> 01:48:32.874
- Got that?
- I understand.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:47.615
All done?

01:49:59.551 --> 01:50:00.551
Buddy.

01:50:00.636 --> 01:50:04.470
You wasted so much tissue,
you don't even pay tax.

01:50:09.895 --> 01:50:10.895
You alone?

01:50:11.146 --> 01:50:12.636
Yeah, I'm still single.

01:50:15.067 --> 01:50:18.525
Too bad about that ticket,
you won't get to fly.

01:50:56.942 --> 01:50:57.942
Dammit...

01:50:58.569 --> 01:51:00.685
You fucking bitch!

01:52:56.019 --> 01:52:57.600
You fucking bitch!

01:53:21.712 --> 01:53:23.327
- What's going on?
- He's coming out.

01:53:30.137 --> 01:53:31.297
Seok-do!

01:53:31.722 --> 01:53:32.837
Where's jang chen?

01:53:33.181 --> 01:53:34.466
He's inside the washroom.

01:53:34.558 --> 01:53:36.264
- Go check it out.
- Yes, sir!

01:53:36.435 --> 01:53:39.677
Seok-do, you did good.

01:53:39.688 --> 01:53:41.019
Right, sorry.

01:53:41.523 --> 01:53:42.558
Throw this out for me.

01:53:43.775 --> 01:53:45.231
I made a bit of a mess,
take care of it.

01:53:45.235 --> 01:53:47.317
Don't worry,
I'll sort things out.

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:49.102
- Go to the er, okay?
- Okay.

01:53:50.699 --> 01:53:51.814
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

01:53:51.908 --> 01:53:53.944
- Are you his boss?
- Yes, I am.

01:53:54.286 --> 01:53:57.028
There was a lot of damage,
we'll need to claim it.

01:53:57.039 --> 01:53:58.700
We're serious crimes unit,
we can do this later...

01:53:58.707 --> 01:54:00.493
You must be so tired.

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.411
We'll need to claim damages,
may I get your ID?

01:54:02.836 --> 01:54:05.703
Bro, did you sort things out?

01:54:05.756 --> 01:54:06.836
Where are you?

01:54:07.049 --> 01:54:08.835
Going home, of course.

01:54:09.217 --> 01:54:12.880
I don't owe you anything now.

01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:18.465
Fucking hell...

01:54:18.894 --> 01:54:22.728
Kiddo, let's go get Mr. won.

01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:48.749
Get out, get out.

01:54:49.466 --> 01:54:51.081
Get the fuck out!

01:54:51.176 --> 01:54:53.508
Wake the fucker in the back!

01:54:53.845 --> 01:54:54.845
When did you smuggle in?

01:54:55.305 --> 01:54:56.670
I'm hungry.

01:54:57.557 --> 01:54:59.118
- When did you get in?
- Go sit over there.

01:54:59.142 --> 01:55:00.427
I'm hungry.

01:55:00.852 --> 01:55:05.186
Speak Korean, asshole!
I know you can speak it!

01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:08.231
Go easy on him.

01:55:09.444 --> 01:55:10.444
Sorry.

01:55:13.615 --> 01:55:14.855
Go in that way, on the left.

01:55:14.866 --> 01:55:16.606
- Keep going.
- Inside!

01:55:16.618 --> 01:55:17.482
You, right.

01:55:17.577 --> 01:55:18.862
- Your fucking head down!
- Left for you.

01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:22.783
- Your head down!
- Good work.

01:55:23.792 --> 01:55:24.792
Fuck off.

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:29.536
Shit, I'm starving...

01:55:31.508 --> 01:55:34.341
- So many of you came...
- Captain!

01:55:34.845 --> 01:55:36.756
Is it true that you wiped out
Chinese-Korean gangs?

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:38.879
Can we do this later?
At a press conference.

01:55:38.890 --> 01:55:41.472
Wait! Did you arrest the boss?

01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:44.893
The boss? Of course,
what's the point otherwise?

01:55:46.022 --> 01:55:47.102
Hey, it's the chief.

01:55:47.524 --> 01:55:48.559
Chief!

01:55:49.192 --> 01:55:52.104
Of course!
I told you we would!

01:55:52.237 --> 01:55:53.773
We rounded up everyone!

01:55:53.947 --> 01:55:55.062
About 307?

01:55:55.157 --> 01:55:56.522
30 men! 30!

01:55:56.992 --> 01:56:01.611
It's me we're talking about,
i get results, chief!

01:56:01.872 --> 01:56:04.784
As soon as I got off,
our eyes met.

01:56:04.833 --> 01:56:05.993
- I got into it right away.
- Afternoon, detectives!

01:56:06.001 --> 01:56:07.161

01:56:10.297 --> 01:56:12.834
There's blood sausage soup
or hangover soup.

01:56:12.841 --> 01:56:14.957
- What'd you like?
- Hangover soup!

01:56:14.968 --> 01:56:15.923
Me too.

01:56:15.927 --> 01:56:17.883
Don't eat that,
you guys worked so hard.

01:56:17.888 --> 01:56:20.971
I'm treating you all to
meat and booze today.

01:56:20.974 --> 01:56:22.589
Thank you!

01:56:22.601 --> 01:56:25.468
Then we should go to
gangnam and drink there!

01:56:25.479 --> 01:56:27.015
No, we can just go this way.

01:56:27.022 --> 01:56:29.058
- We gotta get real booze.
- Yeah, it's got private rooms...

01:56:29.065 --> 01:56:31.852
Right here, follow me.

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:33.350
But that's lamb skewer...

01:56:33.361 --> 01:56:35.477
There's no private room here.

01:56:35.572 --> 01:56:36.982
Sure we do, please go inside.

01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:37.775
They got room.

01:56:37.782 --> 01:56:39.864
But no liquor...

01:56:40.035 --> 01:56:41.991
We'll order some, go inside.

01:56:42.204 --> 01:56:43.785
Let's order a small plate.

01:56:43.914 --> 01:56:47.247
- Go inside, just eat!
- I knew this'd happen.

01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:48.490
Got anything expensive?

01:56:49.461 --> 01:56:50.701
Seok-do!

01:56:52.047 --> 01:56:53.958
The commissioner's asking for you!

01:56:54.341 --> 01:56:55.831

01:56:59.054 --> 01:57:03.263
