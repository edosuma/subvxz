00:13.760 --> 00:17.660
( Beatboxing )

00:17.760 --> 00:20.620
( Rapping )
Yo, my name is Rigby.
I got pizza galore

00:20.720 --> 00:23.180
You may have a lot of pizza,
but I got much more

00:23.280 --> 00:25.540
Had to borrow Benson's car
'cause it's a crisis

00:25.640 --> 00:28.340
Downtown they're selling
slices at half prices

00:28.440 --> 00:30.660
I knew he'd say no,
so I didn't say "please"

00:30.760 --> 00:34.060
I snuck into his office
and made off with deez keys

00:34.160 --> 00:35.500
Deez keys, deez keys

00:35.600 --> 00:37.460
Made off with deez keys

00:37.560 --> 00:39.560
Whoops!

00:42.680 --> 00:44.500
Dude! What the ââ
Hey, it's Benson's fault!

00:44.600 --> 00:46.600
He's got, like,
a million keys on that ring!

00:53.520 --> 00:55.060
Dude, we got to get
those keys back.

00:55.160 --> 00:56.300
But, how?

00:56.400 --> 00:58.580
Let's go ask those scientists
over there.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.860
And that's why
he only has one ear.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.820
( Laughter )

01:02.920 --> 01:04.420
Ahem.

01:04.520 --> 01:05.740
Hey, there, guys

01:05.840 --> 01:07.840
So, we accidentally threw
our bosses car keys

01:07.520 --> 01:09.520
through that window
up there.

01:08.840 --> 01:10.840
Could you just run in there
and grab them for us?

01:10.480 --> 01:12.020
Yeah, sorry, pal.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.380
We're not allowed to interact
with the "test subjects."

01:15.480 --> 01:18.260
Anyway, looks like they landed
in Langer's penthouse,

01:18.360 --> 01:20.660
which is a top security area.

01:20.760 --> 01:21.900
No one goes in there.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
There's got to be
something you can do?

01:23.600 --> 01:26.340
Maybe, but, ya know...

01:26.440 --> 01:27.340
No, thanks.

01:27.440 --> 01:28.300
Aw, what?!
Hey!

01:28.400 --> 01:29.660
Now, if you'll excuse us,

01:29.760 --> 01:31.700
we're on our lunch break.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.540
( Grunts )
( Teeth grind )

01:33.640 --> 01:34.660
Mmm!
( Laughs )

01:34.760 --> 01:36.020
So good.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.420
( Grunts )

01:37.520 --> 01:39.140
( Gulps )

01:39.240 --> 01:40.380
Hmâhmâhm!
Hmâhmâhm!

01:40.480 --> 01:42.220
Too bad Langer
only lets you eat

01:42.320 --> 01:44.180
those gross,
compressed food bars.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.660
Maybe if you help us out,

01:45.760 --> 01:47.580
we could sneak you
some real food?

01:47.680 --> 01:50.860
Maybe something like
thiâiâiâis?

01:50.960 --> 01:51.820
( All gasp )

01:51.920 --> 01:52.900
No! It doesn't matter!

01:53.000 --> 01:54.300
You could never get past

01:54.400 --> 01:56.180
Langer's security systems
anyways.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.460
Uh, well, they might be able
to if we helped them?

01:58.560 --> 02:00.980
Shut up, Tobias!
They don't need to know that!

02:01.080 --> 02:04.140
Well, I'm not gonna risk
losing my job over some food!

02:04.240 --> 02:05.140
( Chomp! )

02:05.240 --> 02:06.580
Blaaaah.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.780
Yeah, we should do it.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.160
Fine. We'll vote on it.
Huddle up.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.380
Dude,
pizza fixes everything.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.340
Yeah, it does!

02:16.440 --> 02:18.100
Okay, we'll help you
get the keys.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.400
We're gonna need four
extraâlarge pepperoni pizzas?

02:20.480 --> 02:23.100
Get the pizzas, and we'll meet
you at your room in an hour.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.260
âOkay!
âOkay!

02:24.360 --> 02:26.440
This never happened.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.540
Ugh!

02:31.640 --> 02:34.500
Why is the pizza place
have to be so far away?

02:34.600 --> 02:36.680
Yeah, but it'll be worth it
when we get those keys.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.340
You got the stuff?
Yeah, dude.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.440
Trent.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.700
Trent: Pepperoni.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.800
It checks out.
All right.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.620
What the?!
What did you do to our room?!

02:58.720 --> 03:00.700
Just give us the keys.
Where are they?

03:00.800 --> 03:02.800
In Langer's penthouse.

03:01.840 --> 03:02.740
âWhat?!
âWhat?!

03:02.840 --> 03:04.300
Oh, come on!

03:04.400 --> 03:06.380
Do you really think we'd
really risk our jobs

03:06.480 --> 03:08.100
and break into
Langer's room?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.200
( Chuckles )
<i>You'regonna do that.</i>

03:09.680 --> 03:11.100
But you said
you'd help us!

03:11.200 --> 03:12.500
And, we are.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.600
We've rigged up your room
as a command station.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.340
Langer's gotten crazy
about security.

03:16.440 --> 03:20.060
Infrared lasers, booby traps,
cameras all over the place.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.780
( Chuckles )
But lucky for you,

03:21.880 --> 03:23.700
our top minds
will guide you through it.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.840
( Chuckles moronically )
Pizza.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.500
( Chuckles )
Yeah.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.140
So you've got about
an hour

03:29.240 --> 03:31.100
to get in and out
and grab the keys

03:31.200 --> 03:33.380
while Langer is busy
at his afternoon workout.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.940
( <i>Grunting)</i>

03:35.040 --> 03:36.860
Ugh!
Fine, we'll do it.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.960
All right,
let's suit these two up!

03:41.400 --> 03:42.740
We're in position.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.460
Trent: Okay, stay put.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.760
Rachel's gonna use a domeâdrone
to distract the guards.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.460
Oh, hey there Hâ2953,
what's going ââ

03:49.560 --> 03:50.900
Oh!
Easy now!

03:51.000 --> 03:52.420
Let's all just...

03:52.520 --> 03:54.300
( Screaming )

03:54.400 --> 03:55.580
Why?!

03:55.680 --> 03:57.100
Yeesh!

03:57.200 --> 03:59.200
The guards are distracted ââ
begin phase 1.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.260
We're at the security panel.
How do we get in?

04:04.360 --> 04:06.180
Rigby, look in the backpack
we gave you

04:06.280 --> 04:08.280
for a reâsealable plastic bag.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.660
Aw, sick!

04:10.760 --> 04:12.580
( Grunts )
What is ââ ugh!

04:12.680 --> 04:13.700
( Panting )

04:13.800 --> 04:15.540
They're not real teeth!

04:15.640 --> 04:18.360
They're just molds of Steffen's
teeth for the dental lock.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.940
Not it!
Not ââ aw, dude!

04:22.040 --> 04:23.060
That's ââ ugh!
( Chuckles )

04:23.160 --> 04:25.160
Fine!

04:25.520 --> 04:26.940
( Snickering )

04:27.040 --> 04:28.940
Stop talking!

04:29.040 --> 04:31.120
I wonder how many people have
had that thing in their mouths?

04:31.200 --> 04:32.660
( Grumbles )

04:32.760 --> 04:34.760
( Ding )

04:35.640 --> 04:38.500
Okay, we're in.
Now what?

04:38.600 --> 04:41.060
Okay, now take the elevator
at the end of the hall

04:41.160 --> 04:42.380
up to the second floor.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.480
Hmâhmâhm.
Hmâhm.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.440
( Elevator dings )

04:52.240 --> 04:54.060
Aah!
Dude, gross!

04:54.160 --> 04:56.160
Why do you still have
those teeth in your mouth?

04:55.880 --> 04:57.020
Uh...
( Slurps )

04:57.120 --> 04:58.380
They're kind of
growing on me.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.860
Ugh!
They're freaking me out.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.620
Well, get used to it, pal.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.780
This is how I look now.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.620
( Slurps )
I look cool.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.420
( Teeth clicking )
( Scoffs ) Nuhâuh.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.300
( Elevator dings )

05:08.400 --> 05:10.100
Now keep walking down
this hallway

05:10.200 --> 05:12.760
and take your first right
to hallway "L."

05:14.320 --> 05:16.460
Okay, now take the black box

05:16.560 --> 05:19.200
out of the backpack
and turn it on.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.460
A fog machine?

05:23.560 --> 05:25.560
Whoa!

05:26.680 --> 05:29.660
Hey, guys, Steffen here to guide
you through the laser hallway.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.540
Don't worry,
you won't trigger the alarm

05:31.640 --> 05:34.140
as long as you do exactly
as I say.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.740
We got to get
those keys, dude.

05:35.840 --> 05:36.700
Ptwah!

05:36.800 --> 05:37.660
Ready?

05:37.760 --> 05:38.660
Ready.
Ready.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.460
Okay...run!

05:40.560 --> 05:41.620
Duck!

05:41.720 --> 05:42.660
Jump!

05:42.760 --> 05:43.980
Roll like a log!

05:44.080 --> 05:46.300
Limbo, mon!

05:46.400 --> 05:48.420
Crab walk!

05:48.520 --> 05:50.420
Now dive!

05:50.520 --> 05:52.220
( Groaning )

05:52.320 --> 05:54.940
Trent: Langer's room is
just across this corridor.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.300
Sweet!
Sweet!

05:56.400 --> 05:58.780
Stop! That room is filled
with motion detectors.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.880
The only way to stop them
from triggering

06:00.280 --> 06:02.300
is to move through very slowly.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.940
Go!

06:04.040 --> 06:05.460
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

06:05.560 --> 06:07.940
Slow down!

06:08.040 --> 06:11.420
No, no ââ much slower.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.420
There's also facialârecognition
scanners,

06:13.520 --> 06:16.060
but if you constantly change
your facial expression,

06:16.160 --> 06:18.820
it shouldn't be able to see you,
okay?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.060
Change!

06:20.160 --> 06:21.140
Change!

06:21.240 --> 06:22.340
Change!

06:22.440 --> 06:23.660
Change!

06:23.760 --> 06:24.700
Change!

06:24.800 --> 06:26.260
Change!
Change!

06:26.360 --> 06:28.360
Take a screenâshot!
( Shutters clicking )

06:28.080 --> 06:29.740
( Laughter )
Wait, wait, wait

06:29.840 --> 06:31.500
Dude, they're just
messing with us.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.260
That is a classic!

06:33.360 --> 06:34.500
Aw, man!
Aw, man!

06:34.600 --> 06:35.500
Rachel: Hey, guys.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.280
This is a conundrum keypad ââ
the hardest keypad known to man.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.900
We're not gonna be able
to crack it,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.240
we need to go in another way.
Reach into your backpack.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.860
There should be
a suctionâcup shaped tool.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.100
Do you have it?
Yeah.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.200
Stick it to the door.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.660
It fell off.
Okay.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.740
You're going to have to lick the
suction cup to get it to stick.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.140
Okay.
Dude, lick it.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.240
I'm not gonna lick it ââ
you lick it!

06:59.680 --> 07:00.620
Dude, just lick it.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.720
I put the teeth
in my mouth.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.420
You lick it!
Ugh ââ fine!

07:04.520 --> 07:06.680
Ow!
( Whimpers )

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Hmâhm!

07:11.240 --> 07:13.840
Sick. Tastes like
a CPR practice dummy.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.740
Whoa!
Whoa!

07:21.840 --> 07:23.780
Fancy.
There they are!

07:23.880 --> 07:25.540
Trent: Okay,
this is Langer's penthouse.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.620
Home stretch.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.020
( Both panting )

07:28.120 --> 07:29.340
Finally!

07:29.440 --> 07:30.940
Now, I know we're excited,

07:31.040 --> 07:32.340
but this is very important.

07:32.440 --> 07:36.020
Do not ââ repeat ââ
do not pick up the keys

07:36.120 --> 07:38.060
from the pedestal
without further ââ

07:38.160 --> 07:40.160
Yeah, boyee!
Yeah, boyee!

07:40.760 --> 07:42.880
Well, now you guys
have gone and done it.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.340
( Screaming )

07:47.440 --> 07:50.160
( Alarm blares )

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
( Alarms continue )

07:55.440 --> 07:57.140
Guys, a little help!

07:57.240 --> 07:59.720
Don't worry. Now, just keep
running straight ahead.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.540
All right,
now close the blast door.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.640
Nothing's getting through that.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.720
I thought you said
nothing could get through!

08:09.600 --> 08:10.700
Whoops.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.800
( Screaming )

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Get to the other side
of the room.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.600
There's a doorway that'll take
you to the main entrance.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.100
What even is this room?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.520
Oh, a giant marble maze room.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.080
Oof! The keys!

08:30.120 --> 08:32.120
Come on!

08:37.560 --> 08:39.060
Now...jump for it!

08:39.160 --> 08:41.380
Aagh!

08:41.480 --> 08:42.740
( Grunting )

08:42.840 --> 08:43.820
Rigby, watch out!

08:43.920 --> 08:45.580
Whoa!

08:45.680 --> 08:47.100
Aw, yeaâuh!

08:47.200 --> 08:49.020
( Buzzer blaring )

08:49.120 --> 08:51.460
The emergency lockdown sequence
has been activated!

08:51.560 --> 08:53.600
Get out of there!

08:55.480 --> 08:56.860
We're not gonna make it!

08:56.960 --> 08:58.960
Yes, we are!

09:00.800 --> 09:02.380
Ready?
Yeah.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.900
Now it's just a straight shot
to the door.

09:05.000 --> 09:05.980
Go!

09:06.080 --> 09:08.080
( Screaming )

09:10.240 --> 09:12.580
Hey, Mordecai, what's that?

09:12.680 --> 09:14.960
Robotic guard dogs?!
Rigby, go left!

09:20.520 --> 09:22.520
Dude, they can fly!

09:28.920 --> 09:30.920
There's the exit!

09:33.080 --> 09:34.940
( Screaming )

09:35.040 --> 09:37.620
( Groaning )

09:37.720 --> 09:38.900
We got the keys.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.780
All: Whoo!

09:40.880 --> 09:42.220
U.S.A.!

09:42.320 --> 09:43.620
U.S.A.!

09:43.720 --> 09:45.720
Do you think Langer
knows we helped?

09:44.920 --> 09:46.340
( Scoffs )
No way!

09:46.440 --> 09:48.060
He's still on biceps.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.460
<i>U.S.A.!</i>

09:49.560 --> 09:50.900
( Chuckles )

09:51.000 --> 09:54.660
( Laughs maniacally )
( Grunts )

09:54.760 --> 09:57.100
âBenson! Benson!
âBenson! Benson!

09:57.200 --> 09:58.580
( Panting )

09:58.680 --> 10:00.620
We're really sorry,
but we...

10:00.720 --> 10:02.460
borrowed your car
without asking.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.300
But here's your keys back.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.780
What?!
You borrowed my car?!

10:06.880 --> 10:10.260
But don't worry,
it's fine.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.540
Oh, it...looks fine.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.500
Yeah, we just needed
to go for a lunch run.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.420
Well, why don't you
just hold onto the keys

10:17.520 --> 10:18.860
till the end of the day,

10:18.960 --> 10:20.960
in case you need
to run any other errands.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.740
( Whistling )

10:23.840 --> 10:25.740
You thinking what I'm thinking?

10:25.840 --> 10:28.080
Pizza run!
Whoops!

10:31.480 --> 10:33.140
Ugh!
Really, dude?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.480
