[ humming]

00:33.826 --> 00:36.240
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

00:38.000 --> 00:39.689
Whoa! Ah!

00:41.033 --> 00:42.723
Shman! The great rad spot

00:42.792 --> 00:44.965
is mega-sweet
for party-boarding!

00:45.033 --> 00:46.000
Indeed.

00:46.067 --> 00:47.551
Any calls while I was out?

00:47.619 --> 00:49.033
Yeah.

00:49.103 --> 00:52.344
You got a telesonic transmission
from Kif a couple hours ago.

00:52.412 --> 00:53.758
[ gasps]

00:53.826 --> 00:55.310
My Kiffy called?

00:55.378 --> 00:57.792
Kif?

00:57.862 --> 00:59.344
Ooh, Amy, you're back!

00:59.412 --> 01:01.689
Another hour and I would have
thought about hanging up.

01:01.758 --> 01:03.862
Why didn't you just
leave a message, sweetie?

01:03.930 --> 01:06.206
Well, um, I've left
hundreds of messages

01:06.275 --> 01:07.861
with your answering machine

01:07.930 --> 01:09.826
but you... never
seem to get them.

01:09.896 --> 01:11.102
Bender!

01:11.171 --> 01:13.655
It's not my fault
if you don't check me.

01:13.724 --> 01:16.310
[ babbling]

01:16.379 --> 01:17.826
Messages erased.

01:17.896 --> 01:20.793
Oh, dearest,
this long distance relationship

01:20.861 --> 01:22.240
is too much to bare.

01:22.310 --> 01:25.965
When even an inch separates us,
I quiver with misery.

01:26.033 --> 01:30.412
So you can imagine how I feel
when it's a billion light-years.

01:30.481 --> 01:31.551
[ crying]

01:31.620 --> 01:35.206
Kif, don't cry,
or you'll get a tummy ache.

01:35.275 --> 01:37.412
Lieutenant, some
things came off me

01:37.481 --> 01:38.758
and clogged the drain

01:38.826 --> 01:40.343
so if you could...
Oh-ho!

01:40.412 --> 01:41.412
What's this?

01:41.481 --> 01:42.826
[ beep]

01:42.896 --> 01:44.310
Well, well, well.

01:44.378 --> 01:46.137
Do my eyes believe me

01:46.206 --> 01:48.930
or it that my bosomy
swan, Leela?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.516
Say again?
You're breaking up.

01:52.861 --> 01:54.240
Oh!

01:54.310 --> 01:55.793
Good news, everyone!

01:55.861 --> 01:58.343
You'll be delivering
pain medicine

01:58.412 --> 02:00.930
to the Hive Mind
of Nigel Seven.

02:02.724 --> 02:05.000
Scruffy's rolling out
a large pill.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.551
You're going to Nigel 7?

02:06.620 --> 02:08.275
Kif's on patrol near there.

02:08.343 --> 02:10.171
You could drop me off
on the way.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.965
We could, but we won't!

02:12.033 --> 02:15.550
It's a spaceship, damn it,
not a prom limousine.

02:15.620 --> 02:19.413
Ooh! If anyone needs me,
I'll be in the angry dome.

02:19.481 --> 02:20.793
[ grumbling]

02:22.861 --> 02:25.655
[ grumbling and mumbling]

02:28.033 --> 02:29.655
LEELA:
This is a very long trip

02:29.723 --> 02:32.620
so we'll all have to go
into hibernative naptosis

02:32.688 --> 02:33.930
to save oxygen.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.413
Aw, I don't even
breathe... oxygen.

02:42.723 --> 02:47.240
[ snoring]

03:03.655 --> 03:05.343
Here I come, Kif.

03:05.413 --> 03:07.723
[ laughing]

03:13.000 --> 03:14.655
[ laughing]

03:14.723 --> 03:16.965
They jumped right out
of their pants.

03:17.033 --> 03:19.896
[ alarm sounds]

03:20.931 --> 03:22.378
Oh, what now?

03:22.448 --> 03:24.620
Activate glass window.

03:25.688 --> 03:27.481
[ gasps]

03:27.550 --> 03:29.000
Kif, I'm sensing a very

03:29.068 --> 03:31.448
sensual disturbance
in the force.

03:31.516 --> 03:33.965
Prepare for ship-to-ship
intimacy.

03:34.033 --> 03:36.000
Yes, sir, Captain.

03:47.688 --> 03:50.896
[ snoring]

03:50.965 --> 03:51.861
[ loud clang]

03:51.930 --> 03:53.000
[ screeching]

03:53.067 --> 03:54.103
[ shrieks]

03:54.171 --> 03:55.620
How about I help you
finish that dream

03:55.688 --> 03:56.723
you were having about me?

03:56.793 --> 03:58.861
Okay. I was just
at this part.

03:58.930 --> 04:00.068
[ battle cry]

04:00.137 --> 04:02.000
[ groans]

04:02.068 --> 04:03.965
Oh... eh... let's try that

04:04.033 --> 04:05.965
a little lower
and a lot softer.

04:06.033 --> 04:07.826
Imagine you stowing away

04:07.895 --> 04:10.240
and stealing
a licensed starship!

04:10.310 --> 04:13.550
Oh, it's so romantic,
it gives me the shivers!

04:13.620 --> 04:14.826
[ shivering]

04:14.896 --> 04:17.103
I don't care how
much trouble I get in.

04:17.172 --> 04:20.896
I needed to feel my
lips pressed against
your lipless beak.

04:22.343 --> 04:26.103
Oh, Amy, I can't stand having
a whole universe between us.

04:26.172 --> 04:28.310
I've been thinking
a lot about this

04:28.379 --> 04:30.689
and, well, would you
move in with me?

04:30.757 --> 04:32.447
Here? But, uh...

04:32.516 --> 04:35.000
wouldn't it be crowded?

04:35.067 --> 04:36.103
Well, no, no.

04:36.172 --> 04:37.757
It's really twice the size.

04:37.826 --> 04:40.654
You can use the floor,
and I'll have the ceiling.

04:40.723 --> 04:41.723
See?

04:43.103 --> 04:44.274
[ giggles]

04:44.343 --> 04:48.000
Kif, you have so much
creativity and niceness

04:48.067 --> 04:50.206
but I'm not sure if I...

04:50.274 --> 04:53.689
Hush. Before you answer,
come thither.

04:54.723 --> 04:57.240
KIF:
This is the Holo-Shed.

04:57.310 --> 04:59.896
It can simulate
anything you desire

04:59.965 --> 05:01.379
and nothing can hurt you

05:01.447 --> 05:03.000
except when
it malfunctions

05:03.067 --> 05:04.826
and the holograms
become real.

05:04.896 --> 05:07.413
Well, that probably
won't happen this time.

05:07.482 --> 05:08.620
I wanted to show you

05:08.689 --> 05:11.000
what life could be like
if we were together.

05:11.067 --> 05:14.310
Computer,
run program "Kif One."

05:14.379 --> 05:16.240
[ whirring]

05:16.310 --> 05:17.481
[ gasps]

05:17.550 --> 05:20.447
This is so beautiful!

05:20.516 --> 05:21.757
Spirit!

05:21.826 --> 05:23.723
Kif, that's the pony
I always wanted

05:23.793 --> 05:24.862
but my parents said

05:24.930 --> 05:26.620
I had too many
ponies already.

05:26.689 --> 05:29.137
Yes, I programmed it in
for you.

05:29.206 --> 05:31.379
Four million lines of BASIC.

05:31.447 --> 05:34.481
And-and if this isn't
the life you want

05:34.550 --> 05:35.723
how about this?

05:35.793 --> 05:37.896
Run program "Kif Two."

05:37.965 --> 05:39.862
[ whirring]

05:39.930 --> 05:41.793
Oh, Kif!

05:41.862 --> 05:45.654
We could live here
at the shore of the
Tranquilibrius Sea

05:45.723 --> 05:46.965
in a time-share.

05:47.033 --> 05:49.586
And I would pluck
the moon from the sky

05:49.654 --> 05:51.206
just to see you smile.

05:51.274 --> 05:53.723
[ grunting]

05:53.793 --> 05:55.723
Almost got it.

05:55.793 --> 05:58.343
It seems to be sort of stuck.

05:58.413 --> 05:59.793
[ groaning]

05:59.862 --> 06:01.586
I love you!

06:01.654 --> 06:02.862
[ gurgling]

Ooh!

06:04.240 --> 06:05.964
[ coughing]

06:06.033 --> 06:09.964

"Kif colon slash slash three."

06:13.033 --> 06:14.310
AMY:
This isn't bad.

06:14.379 --> 06:16.206
My aunt had a
place like this.

06:16.274 --> 06:19.586
Amy, we could live in
a bus station bathroom
for all I care.

06:19.654 --> 06:23.206
As long as we're together,
it'll feel like a castle to me.

06:23.274 --> 06:27.516
Kif, I'd love to live
with you... someday.

06:27.586 --> 06:29.862
But before then,
there's still lots

06:29.930 --> 06:31.550
I want to do on my own.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.586
[ creaking and static]

06:33.654 --> 06:35.206
What was that?

06:35.274 --> 06:38.103
Oh, dear.
I fear the Holo-Shed
might be broken again.

06:38.172 --> 06:41.274
Well, as long as we don't
cross paths with Attila the...

[ loud, horrific neighing]

06:48.516 --> 06:50.103

And there's
Professor Moriarty.

06:50.172 --> 06:51.689
Jack the Ripper.

06:51.757 --> 06:53.206
Evil Lincoln.

06:53.274 --> 06:55.172
[ evil laughter]

06:55.240 --> 06:56.481
Right-o, gents.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.896
It's another simulation
gone mad, so murder and mayhem.

06:59.965 --> 07:01.343
Standard procedure.

07:01.413 --> 07:04.033
[ wild yelling]

The Holo-Shed's
on the fritz again.

07:21.033 --> 07:22.550
The characters turned real!

07:22.620 --> 07:24.206
Damn! The last time
that happened

07:24.274 --> 07:26.516
I got slapped
with three paternity suits.

07:26.586 --> 07:28.930
[ fierce neighing]

Oh, my God!I want Daddy!

Listen up, history's
greatest villains.

07:33.103 --> 07:36.379

before I start blasting

I could use some relaxation.

08:29.379 --> 08:31.413

09:06.724 --> 09:08.688
Yes... it's great.

And not one of those
bogus everyday miracles

like a sunrise.

09:13.861 --> 09:15.206
Aren't you a male?

09:15.274 --> 09:16.379
Yeah, what's the deal?

09:17.586 --> 09:19.172
I figured out you
biological creatures

09:19.240 --> 09:20.413
it's something else!

09:24.931 --> 09:26.481
Look, I'm sure we're all

09:26.551 --> 09:29.413
a little unclear on
how anyone gets pregnant

09:29.481 --> 09:31.136
so, Kif, pray explain

09:31.206 --> 09:34.000
and don't spare the dirty words
where appropriate.

09:34.067 --> 09:36.033
Well, it's quite
simple, really.

09:36.102 --> 09:37.517
When one of my species

09:37.586 --> 09:39.654
experiences deep
feelings of love

09:39.724 --> 09:42.586
we enter a so-called
"receptive state."

09:42.654 --> 09:45.033
You disgust me. Go on.

09:45.102 --> 09:46.274
At that point

09:46.344 --> 09:48.965
our skin becomes
a semi-permeable membrane

09:49.033 --> 09:51.861
which allows the passage
of genetic material.

09:51.931 --> 09:55.379
I held Amy's hand,
and voila.

09:55.447 --> 09:58.931
Well, okay, but that better be
all there is.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.895
Oh, Amy, you'll be a mother!

10:06.620 --> 10:08.793
What a wondrous
affirmation of our love

10:08.861 --> 10:11.000
and all from
the touch of your hand.

10:21.481 --> 10:23.067
I mean,
what about that, Kif?

10:23.136 --> 10:25.895
Well, I suppose I might have
gotten pregnant that way

10:25.965 --> 10:28.067
or even from a toilet seat

10:28.136 --> 10:31.826
though that's impossible
since I have a private washroom.

Ah, my home

your flush seems to be set
on "stun" not "kill."

10:39.447 --> 10:42.551
[ nervous stuttering]

10:42.620 --> 10:45.067
Look, Kif,
I probably am the mother

10:45.136 --> 10:46.895
although maybe I'm not.

10:46.965 --> 10:48.379
Of course, I hope I am

10:48.447 --> 10:51.620
but just in case I'm not,
maybe we should have a test.

10:51.688 --> 10:52.688
A test!

10:52.758 --> 10:54.688
I demand a test!

10:58.654 --> 11:00.447
Even I laughed at me

11:00.517 --> 11:04.240
when I built this alien
cross-species genetic analyzer

11:04.309 --> 11:06.586
but I guess I showed myself.

11:06.654 --> 11:09.758
Subjects, please
enter the chamber.

11:14.586 --> 11:17.067
Now to take
a DNA sample.

11:20.136 --> 11:21.447
[ inhales deeply]

11:25.724 --> 11:27.344
When I pull this switch

11:27.413 --> 11:30.586
the maternifuge will spin
at 10,000 RPM

11:30.654 --> 11:34.102
separating out everyone
who isn't the mother...

11:34.172 --> 11:37.620
father... whatever.

11:37.688 --> 11:40.379
[ all screaming]

11:43.826 --> 11:45.274
Faster, faster!

11:54.965 --> 11:58.895
Good! Fry's ejection
indicates that he is
not the man-mama.

11:58.965 --> 12:00.758
[ grunting]

12:02.517 --> 12:04.309
Nor is Captain Brannigan.

12:04.379 --> 12:06.033
Oh, thank you, merciful God.

12:06.102 --> 12:07.620
[ grunts]

12:07.688 --> 12:12.000
Zoidberg? What the hell
were you doing in there?

12:12.067 --> 12:13.620
That's where I live.

12:13.688 --> 12:15.309
I have no home.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.517
[ scream]

12:23.136 --> 12:25.654
Amy? But that means...

12:33.206 --> 12:35.033
Leela must have
impregnated me

12:35.102 --> 12:37.067
when she grabbed
my ungloved hand.

12:37.136 --> 12:39.379
That explains the poster
in hygiene class--

12:39.447 --> 12:41.481
"No glove, no love."

12:41.551 --> 12:44.240
Wow, this is all so confusing.

12:44.309 --> 12:46.136
Leela, how could you?

12:46.206 --> 12:48.654
Our love has had to endure
your constant hatred

12:48.724 --> 12:50.000
and now this?

12:50.067 --> 12:52.481
Stop testing our love!

12:52.551 --> 12:54.551
Oh, please,
Captain.

12:54.620 --> 12:57.309
I thank Leela for the DNA
she gave me

12:57.379 --> 12:58.758
but in my species

12:58.826 --> 13:00.206
the true parent is the one

13:00.274 --> 13:02.793
who inspired the initial
feeling of love.

13:02.861 --> 13:05.344
We call that person
the smizmar

13:05.413 --> 13:08.931
and my smizmar is Amy.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.136
So the toilet seat is like
the uncle or something?

13:14.240 --> 13:16.517
Sorry I got
your boyfriend pregnant.

13:16.586 --> 13:18.206
That's okay.

13:18.274 --> 13:20.067
At least Kif's
baby shower
should be fun.

13:20.136 --> 13:22.172
I better put it on my calendar.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.240
Thursday,
baby shower.
Enter.

13:27.758 --> 13:29.724
Might as well plan
for my new life while I'm at it.

13:29.793 --> 13:31.793
Set motherhood mode.

13:39.274 --> 13:41.551
To motherhood.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.895
[ chugging noises]

13:53.344 --> 13:56.758
Mom, Dad, I know
this is weird, but...

13:56.826 --> 14:00.102
Yeah, yeah, we don't care how
squishy alien get pregnant.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.309
All we care is that
we have grandchild now.

14:02.379 --> 14:04.481
You're very open-minded,
Mrs. Wong.

14:04.551 --> 14:06.067
Hey, you call her Grandma now.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.274
Call me Grandma like crazy.

14:07.344 --> 14:08.654
All the time.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.309
Check it out, y'all.

14:10.379 --> 14:12.206
Everyone we invited is here...

14:12.274 --> 14:13.688
Also Zoidberg!

14:13.758 --> 14:15.172
...so let's open the gifts!

14:15.240 --> 14:17.136
[ cheering]

14:17.206 --> 14:20.481
We'll start with
this one from Bender.

14:25.379 --> 14:27.102
It's my booties
from when I was a kid.

14:27.172 --> 14:29.413
Uh, they're
already bronzed.

14:29.481 --> 14:30.654
They arebronze.

14:30.724 --> 14:32.826
And this one's from Leela.

14:32.895 --> 14:35.102
Oh, I just love the bow.

14:35.172 --> 14:36.895
I wonder what it is.

14:36.965 --> 14:39.344
Yes, I wonder
what wegot you.

14:39.413 --> 14:40.517
[ grunts]

14:40.586 --> 14:42.309
It's a basket.

14:42.379 --> 14:44.379
For picnics?

14:44.447 --> 14:45.965
It means a lot to me.

14:46.033 --> 14:47.758
It's the basket
my parents left me in

14:47.826 --> 14:49.102
at the orphanarium.

14:49.172 --> 14:51.136
You could use it
for picnics.

14:51.206 --> 14:52.172
Here, Amy.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.481
We get this one
for you.

14:53.551 --> 14:55.551
Oh, is it a new party-board?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.344
It's a board, all right.

14:58.413 --> 14:59.965
An ironing board.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.309
We had your old
party-board converted

15:02.379 --> 15:04.654
now that you not
be partying anymore.

15:04.724 --> 15:07.447
You-you trashed
my party-board?

15:07.517 --> 15:08.620
Damn right.

15:08.688 --> 15:10.793
Now you a mom,
the only surfing you do

15:10.861 --> 15:13.136
is under a big wave
of responsibility.

15:13.206 --> 15:16.447
Oh, this is the happiest
moment of my life.

15:16.517 --> 15:18.688
You all brought
such wonderful gifts

15:18.758 --> 15:20.724
but the greatest gift...

15:20.793 --> 15:21.379
Mine!

15:21.447 --> 15:22.688
...is the bond

15:22.758 --> 15:24.688
I share with
my smizmar, Amy

15:24.758 --> 15:27.826
for soon, the quivering
mass of life within me

15:27.895 --> 15:30.136
will depend upon us both.

15:30.206 --> 15:32.067
Even now, I can sense it

15:32.136 --> 15:35.793
feeding, squirming,
searching, questing

15:35.861 --> 15:39.309
and shortly, it will
rend my loins in twain

15:39.379 --> 15:43.481
burst forth and pull us
down, down, down

15:43.551 --> 15:46.102
into the deep, dark
waters of commitment.

15:46.172 --> 15:48.309
That's so beautiful.

15:48.379 --> 15:49.895
[ sniffling]

15:49.965 --> 15:52.551
Yes, it's... it's...

15:52.620 --> 15:53.895
[ sobbing]

15:53.965 --> 15:56.240
No, I can't do this!

15:58.895 --> 16:01.033
[ all gasping]

16:01.102 --> 16:04.033
[ infant-like crying]

16:10.895 --> 16:13.136
Oh, how could Amy leave me?

16:13.206 --> 16:15.481
When will women learn
to take responsibility

16:15.551 --> 16:17.551
for the children
they've helped create?

16:17.620 --> 16:19.000
[ gurgling]

16:19.067 --> 16:20.344
The quickening!

16:20.413 --> 16:21.965
My time is near!

16:22.033 --> 16:23.620
I must return
to my homeworld

16:23.688 --> 16:25.826
to perform the ancient
birthing rites.

16:25.895 --> 16:28.274
Let me know how that turns out.

16:48.274 --> 16:51.136
I must now embark on
a perilous journey

16:51.206 --> 16:53.481
to give birth in
precisely the same swamp

16:53.551 --> 16:54.965
in which I was born.

16:55.033 --> 16:57.206
If it's so dangerous,
I'd better go with you.

16:57.274 --> 16:59.379
A gal has to protect her DNA.

16:59.447 --> 17:00.654
No, Leela.

17:00.724 --> 17:02.033
Tradition demands that

17:02.102 --> 17:04.067
I make this journey
with my smizmar

17:04.136 --> 17:07.931
and since Amy isn't here,
I must go it alone.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.309
Farewell, for we may
never meet again.

17:14.964 --> 17:16.689
[ grunts]

17:16.758 --> 17:19.862
My scrapes feel
a little better now.

17:19.931 --> 17:22.862
[ grunting]

17:22.931 --> 17:25.550
Hey, what's this
fat, ugly thing?

17:25.619 --> 17:28.205
A frog, a toad,
or yo' mama?

17:28.275 --> 17:30.240
[ laughing]

17:31.413 --> 17:32.931
[ muffled screaming]

17:33.000 --> 17:34.481
It's a poisonous froad!

17:34.550 --> 17:35.862
No one move.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.550
[ inhaling deeply]

17:39.862 --> 17:41.034
[ squeals]

17:41.103 --> 17:45.034
I'm back, baby.

17:45.103 --> 17:47.895
[ bubbling]

17:53.240 --> 17:54.517
Behold...

17:54.586 --> 17:57.826
the sacred ancestral
birthing grounds of my family.

17:57.895 --> 17:59.000
[ sniffing]

17:59.067 --> 18:00.862
Smells like
a jockstrap.

18:05.309 --> 18:08.517
I am the Grand Midwife!

18:08.586 --> 18:09.378
Hi.

18:09.448 --> 18:11.862
I am Kif, of the clan Kroker

18:11.931 --> 18:13.862
come to bear my young.

18:13.931 --> 18:16.689
Then let the tea
of new life be brewed.

18:16.758 --> 18:18.309
As it is writ

18:18.378 --> 18:22.205
"And both shall lift
the jug together."

18:22.275 --> 18:23.654
Where is your smizmar?

18:23.723 --> 18:25.309
She is not with me.

18:25.378 --> 18:27.034
Oh, the sorrow!

18:27.103 --> 18:29.689
Oh, the shame!

18:29.758 --> 18:32.205
I'm sorry. I'm probably just
making you feel worse.

18:32.275 --> 18:34.654
As long as Amy is with me
in my heart

18:34.723 --> 18:37.205
I will have the strength of two.

18:37.275 --> 18:40.517
[ strained grunting]

18:41.826 --> 18:45.792
Apparently Amy hasn't been
working out much lately.

18:50.931 --> 18:53.034
As the tea boils

18:53.103 --> 18:56.034
please join hands
with your beloved smizmar.

18:57.448 --> 18:58.826
Oh, right.

18:58.895 --> 19:00.964
Sorry, but I've memorized
the ceremony by rote

19:01.034 --> 19:02.205
and it mentions her a lot.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.619
I'll try to endure.

19:03.689 --> 19:04.862
Good, 'cause I'm not
changing it.

19:04.931 --> 19:06.723
Now turn, ye two

19:06.792 --> 19:09.931
and gaze deeply into
each other's eyes.

19:11.413 --> 19:12.481
What are you looking at?

19:12.550 --> 19:15.826
May the love I sense
between you at this moment

19:15.895 --> 19:19.481
remain with you both
through all your days.

19:19.550 --> 19:21.689
[ sobbing]

19:21.758 --> 19:25.275
The tea of new life is ready.

19:25.344 --> 19:28.103
Let those whose love
created this life

19:28.172 --> 19:31.103
speak each other's names,
then drink.

19:35.862 --> 19:37.654
[ quietly]:
Amy.

19:37.723 --> 19:39.344
AMY:
Kif!

19:41.378 --> 19:43.723
[ all gasping]

19:43.792 --> 19:46.481
Amy, is it you
or have I gone crazy
with loneliness?

19:46.550 --> 19:47.689
Both!

19:50.000 --> 19:51.448
[ squeals]

19:51.517 --> 19:53.758
I still don't know
if I'm ready for this

19:53.826 --> 19:55.723
but I do know I love you

19:55.792 --> 19:57.689
and I want to be here
beside you.

19:57.758 --> 19:59.240
Great, now I lost my place.

19:59.309 --> 20:00.826
I'm starting over.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.413
Oh, no time.

20:02.481 --> 20:03.689
It is begun.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.136
[ pained moaning]

20:10.895 --> 20:13.481
[ squishing noises]

20:13.550 --> 20:14.758
Ew.

20:14.826 --> 20:16.240
Neat!

20:16.309 --> 20:17.964
You can do it, Kif.

20:18.034 --> 20:20.103
[ moaning]

20:20.172 --> 20:22.895
Ooh, nilly!

20:22.964 --> 20:25.205
[ groaning]

20:27.964 --> 20:29.619
[ liquid whoosh]

20:29.689 --> 20:30.895
[ gasping]

20:33.034 --> 20:34.378
Oh, man!

20:40.792 --> 20:42.205
Amy, my love, tell me--

20:42.275 --> 20:44.275
are they making it
to the water?

20:49.964 --> 20:51.136
Amy!

20:51.205 --> 20:52.758
Shoo!

20:52.826 --> 20:54.550
Stay away from my babies!

21:05.034 --> 21:07.619
The birthing is complete.

21:07.689 --> 21:08.862
[ cheering]

21:08.931 --> 21:10.205
Oh, thank goodness.

21:10.275 --> 21:12.586
I will now
take my leave.

21:12.654 --> 21:15.309
I live here, so I won't actually
be going anywhere

21:15.378 --> 21:18.378
but you don't
have to talk to me anymore.

21:18.448 --> 21:20.240
Congratulations!Nice work.

21:20.309 --> 21:21.413
Way to go, squishy!

21:23.826 --> 21:25.619
LEELA:
There goes my DNA.

21:25.689 --> 21:27.895
What a disgusting
and beautiful process.

21:27.964 --> 21:30.000
That's birth for you.

21:30.067 --> 21:32.654
Well, we've given them
a great start, Amy

21:32.723 --> 21:34.931
and in 20 years
they'll sprout legs

21:35.000 --> 21:37.931
and crawl back onto land
as children.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.826
I'll be ready then.
