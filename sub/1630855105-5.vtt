to getting answers from...

14:29.967 --> 14:32.767

one year after I was born,
his wife Sheila

it's time to go meet her,

16:00.100 --> 16:01.567

16:01.567 --> 16:03.567

actually pretty nervous.

like

when you leave like this, you
literally drop

18:53.467 --> 18:56.567
and walk away from
everything that you've ever...

that Rosanna is a good person
and...

26:40.667 --> 26:43.367
<i>So, he can introduce us to</i>
<i>my grandmother.</i>

26:43.367 --> 26:46.567
-Was the flight good?
-Yeah. It was actually
pretty quick.

26:49.100 --> 26:52.185
It's crazy seeing the two of
you together, it's like two
Jeremiahs.

26:52.185 --> 26:52.667
It's crazy seeing the two of
you together, it's like two
Jeremiahs.

26:52.667 --> 26:53.000
-The only difference is the
height and the eyes--
-It's two Bills.

26:55.767 --> 26:57.667
-Nah, nah, nah.
-[laughing]

26:57.667 --> 27:00.166
-It's two Hiltabidels! Two
Hiltabidels!
-Two Hiltabidels!

27:00.166 --> 27:02.900
-We'll go with that.
-Yes, it's a...

27:02.967 --> 27:06.000
-I love it.
-[Jeremiah] No, I'm glad you,
you know you came out here.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.767
You know, meeting Grandmother,
and meeting you guys...

27:08.767 --> 27:12.767
that's just...
closing that gap
in that circle a little more.

27:12.767 --> 27:15.767
It's almost... it's almost
closed but there's still a
little bit more to go.

27:15.767 --> 27:17.767
Still wanna find out a few
more things.

27:17.767 --> 27:19.467
I'm happy to be here with
you, man.

27:19.467 --> 27:21.066
Pretty good.

27:21.667 --> 27:22.185
It means a lot to us, so...

27:22.185 --> 27:22.900
It means a lot to us, so...

27:22.967 --> 27:23.000
It's no problem, you're
family, man.

27:26.667 --> 27:29.467
It feels good to be called
family because,

27:29.467 --> 27:32.500
I never imagined I would
hear the words

27:32.567 --> 27:35.100
coming from an actual
blood relative.

27:35.100 --> 27:37.667
Yeah. I appreciate it.

27:39.667 --> 27:42.200
[sentimental instrumental
music playing]

27:47.700 --> 27:49.166
Excited to meet Grandma?

27:51.400 --> 27:52.185
I'm definitely excited.

27:52.185 --> 27:53.000
I'm definitely excited.

27:53.166 --> 27:55.166
[Jeremiah] Um, and
now, nervous.

27:56.867 --> 27:59.000
This trip is...

27:59.066 --> 28:01.400
all about getting answers, and
hopefully I get 'em, you know?

28:02.266 --> 28:03.567
What happened?

28:05.567 --> 28:08.066
And what was going on
between... between the
two?

28:08.066 --> 28:09.367
You know what I mean?

28:12.967 --> 28:14.600
[Bill] Hopefully, Grandma can
help with those...

28:14.967 --> 28:16.700
questions.

28:18.367 --> 28:22.100
I mean to have you here is
like, it means everything to
me, you know what I mean?

28:22.100 --> 28:22.185
Honestly, I don't know if
I would... if I would
have came here

28:22.185 --> 28:23.000
Honestly, I don't know if
I would... if I would
have came here

28:24.900 --> 28:26.100
if...

28:27.066 --> 28:29.166
you were or any of y'all...

28:29.166 --> 28:31.166
none of my cousins would
have came along,

28:31.166 --> 28:33.867
I don't think I could
have done it.

28:33.867 --> 28:37.000
Just because my nerves would
have...

28:37.000 --> 28:39.500
-would have taken over,
you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

28:39.567 --> 28:41.400
So to... so to have you here,
is like

28:41.467 --> 28:42.967
it...
it just means everything.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.667
I'm glad I could be here.

28:45.667 --> 28:48.467
[Jeremiah] <i>To go meet</i>
<i>my grandmother is...</i>

28:49.000 --> 28:50.900
a huge deal for me.

28:50.967 --> 28:52.185
You know I'm... I'm excited
but I'm nervous as well.

28:52.185 --> 28:53.000
You know I'm... I'm excited
but I'm nervous as well.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.100
Now...

28:55.100 --> 28:57.567
is that the way it's going
to be when I show up
there? I don't know, but

28:57.567 --> 29:00.066
<i>with Bill's support, that's</i>
<i>going to help me get</i>
<i>through the emotions</i>

29:00.066 --> 29:01.600
of meeting her.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.066
<i>I wanna get more answers</i>
<i>about my father,</i>

29:19.066 --> 29:21.767
but I have no idea how
she's going to react to seeing
me.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.266
[Jeremiah] Oh, yeah.

29:31.900 --> 29:34.166
[suspenseful music playing]

29:45.200 --> 29:48.200
[sentimental instrumental

29:59.700 --> 30:01.200
This way?

30:04.166 --> 30:05.700
[Jeremiah] <i>When I walked into</i>
<i>Grandma's house,</i>

30:05.767 --> 30:07.900
<i>I felt so many emotions,</i>
<i>I didn't know where to start.</i>

30:07.967 --> 30:10.867
But my biggest fear is that
my grandmother is

30:10.867 --> 30:13.323
gonna blame for her son's
death.

30:13.323 --> 30:13.567
gonna blame for her son's
death.

30:13.567 --> 30:14.000
-Hi, Grandma. How you doing?
-[Grandma] Hi.

30:16.367 --> 30:17.867
Comin' in for a hug.

30:22.266 --> 30:25.567
-Yeah, I'm... I'm one of the
tall ones. This is Jeremiah.
-[laughing]

30:25.567 --> 30:28.266
-[Bill] And his wife, Carmela.
-How you doing?

30:29.400 --> 30:31.166
Mm.

30:32.867 --> 30:35.400
[sniffles]

30:39.100 --> 30:41.266
[breathing heavily]

30:43.200 --> 30:43.323
You okay?

30:43.323 --> 30:44.000
You okay?

30:45.467 --> 30:47.100
No. [chuckles weakly]

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
-Ooh, thank you.
-And that's for you.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.767
Ooh, thank you.

[Jeremiah] <i>When I walked</i>
<i>into Grandma's house,</i>

31:00.867 --> 31:03.266
<i>she was all open arms and...</i>

31:03.266 --> 31:06.266
you know growing up
Amish, I never got hugs.

31:06.266 --> 31:08.100
[Grandma speaking]

31:08.100 --> 31:10.600
[Jeremiah] <i>And here I am,</i>
<i>I get an actual hug from my</i>

31:13.500 --> 31:14.000
It just made me feel like
I was...

31:16.166 --> 31:17.667
in a happy place.

31:19.100 --> 31:21.967
[Grandma] <i>I'm glad I finally</i>
<i>got to meet him,</i>

31:21.967 --> 31:26.000
and, see it's true I have a
grandson I didn't know.

31:26.467 --> 31:28.100
So...

31:28.166 --> 31:30.066
I'm just overjoyed.

31:30.066 --> 31:31.500
And happy today.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.323
Yes. And the way they walk.

31:43.323 --> 31:44.000
Yes. And the way they walk.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.300
The way they sit, the way they
walk.

31:46.367 --> 31:47.967
-Hmm-mmm.
-From behind they both

31:47.967 --> 31:49.266
walk exactly the same.

31:49.266 --> 31:51.166
The only difference is the
height.

31:51.166 --> 31:53.066
Everything else, same.

31:53.066 --> 31:53.900
And the hair.

31:54.667 --> 31:55.767
[Carmela] Yup.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.500
You see?

31:57.567 --> 31:58.700
Definitely a Hiltabidel.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.000
Hey, I'm proud to be one.

32:02.767 --> 32:05.367
So... so what was Larry like?

32:07.100 --> 32:08.100
-[chuckling]
-Was he?

32:09.367 --> 32:10.367
Really?

32:14.467 --> 32:16.000
[Carmela] Sounds familiar.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.100
No. It's always her way.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.667
-That's what he says.
-[laughing]

32:22.667 --> 32:24.700
-[Grandma laughing]
-He says.

32:25.100 --> 32:26.266
Yeah.

32:27.266 --> 32:30.667
My grandmother
has a very warm
personality, and...

32:30.667 --> 32:32.667
she immediately made me feel
at home.

32:32.667 --> 32:35.667
And that made me feel good,
because...

32:35.667 --> 32:37.900
you know, I finally
believed I belonged somewhere.

32:39.467 --> 32:40.567
So...

32:43.767 --> 32:44.000
[Jeremiah] You got a
whole bunch of
'em, huh?

32:47.900 --> 32:50.200
-[Jeremiah] <i>Oh that's Larry?</i>
-[Grandma] <i>And...</i>

32:56.567 --> 32:59.266
[slow instrumental music
playing]

32:59.467 --> 33:01.033
Wow.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.467
[Jeremiah] <i>Grandmother</i>
<i>has pictures of</i>
<i>the entire family.</i>

33:10.767 --> 33:11.967
And,

33:11.967 --> 33:13.323
there was a painting that
caught my attention.

33:13.323 --> 33:14.000
there was a painting that
caught my attention.

33:15.100 --> 33:19.367
-So, who's that painting? Is
that Larry?
-[Grandma] Yeah.

33:19.367 --> 33:21.900
[Jeremiah] <i>It ended up being</i>
<i>a painting of my father.</i>

33:21.967 --> 33:24.100
<i>And, it just felt like...</i>

33:24.100 --> 33:27.667
there was somebody else
there with us, as well.

33:27.667 --> 33:30.367
<i>I mean, there... there were so</i>
<i>many emotions going on.</i>

33:31.600 --> 33:34.367
<i>Seeing the pictures of my</i>
<i>father as a baby,</i>

33:34.967 --> 33:36.867
<i>and also growing up,</i>

33:37.800 --> 33:40.467
<i>and then his life</i>
<i>suddenly ended,</i>

33:41.800 --> 33:43.166
that was hard to face.

33:43.767 --> 33:44.000
<i>I couldn't even talk.</i>

33:46.567 --> 33:49.266
<i>Everything came crashing down</i>

<i>all over again, and...</i>

33:51.567 --> 33:53.967
<i>I realized everything that</i>
<i>I've lost.</i>

33:53.967 --> 33:55.266
You know...

33:55.266 --> 33:57.100
I never had him as a dad.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.266
And the worst part is...

34:00.266 --> 34:02.600
<i>my birth is probably what</i>
<i>caused his death.</i>

34:11.667 --> 34:13.323

[Grandma speaking]

34:24.467 --> 34:25.800
I...

34:27.867 --> 34:29.500
[Jeremiah] I feel...

34:29.567 --> 34:31.266
that my dad was leading me

34:32.467 --> 34:34.266
in all these directions.

34:35.667 --> 34:38.166
You know, I wanna find out
more about his death.

34:39.967 --> 34:42.667
Like, I've heard so many
different stories already,
it's just...

34:44.066 --> 34:47.000
I still believe that I am
the reason.

the hurt that he was feeling
was lifting.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.667
Ah.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.000
You know, when Grandmother
told me that, I'm not

37:15.467 --> 37:17.266
the reason my father got
killed,

37:17.266 --> 37:18.667
you know, a sense of relief

37:18.667 --> 37:21.467
just came over me, because
I'd always been...

37:21.467 --> 37:25.500
you know, blamin' myself
and thinking that I'm the
reason that it happened, but

37:25.567 --> 37:27.467
you know, she says it's not.

37:29.767 --> 37:33.200
I think it went really well.
I'm sure it took a weight
off his chest

37:33.266 --> 37:36.200
to hear from Grandma
saying he had nothing to
with it.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.467

-Mmmm.

Hmmm, and you.

wouldn't let go of my arm?
-Yeah.

-You see at the table, she
wouldn't let go of my arm?
-Yeah.

she was very proud
of you.

-Hmmm?
-She was looking at you like,
"That's my grandson."

-Yeah, it was... You are.
-'Cause I am.

41:07.100 --> 41:09.767
<i>you know, upset with me,</i>
<i>and you know,</i>

41:09.767 --> 41:11.867
<i>probably wondering if they</i>
<i>didn't raise me right.</i>

41:13.567 --> 41:15.967
<i>I mean, I... I really love</i>
<i>my parents.</i>

41:15.967 --> 41:18.867
And I'm worried that this
decision is gonna break
their hearts.

41:18.867 --> 41:21.500
Uh, you know, that's the
last thing I wanna do.

41:31.367 --> 41:33.467
[suspenseful music playing]

41:33.467 --> 41:35.600
[Jeremiah] On the next episode
of <i>Return to Amish...</i>

41:35.667 --> 41:38.100
You face down right here,
and you put your head down
here.

41:38.100 --> 41:40.300
-Okay.
-And kinda put your arm on
the side, like that.

41:40.367 --> 41:43.166
I've been wanting to get
this tattoo for a long
time, but...

41:43.166 --> 41:45.467
-it wasn't after I met my
grandmother...
-[buzzing]

41:45.467 --> 41:47.667
<i>...that I knew</i>
<i>the time was right.</i>

41:47.667 --> 41:49.567
This is just helping
close that gap.

41:49.567 --> 41:51.567
I wanna talk to you
before we go.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.767
Okay.

41:53.767 --> 41:57.500
I kind of have to
tell him how I feel.

41:57.567 --> 41:59.300
So, what is it you wanna talk
about?

41:59.367 --> 42:00.500
[in foreign language]

42:02.467 --> 42:04.000
[siren blaring]

42:04.066 --> 42:06.867
I was stopped in my horse
and buggy.

42:06.867 --> 42:09.667
[Johnny] <i>I feel bad because,</i>
<i>if I do something wrong,</i>

42:09.667 --> 42:12.066
<i>the Amish punish my family</i>
<i>for it.</i>

42:12.066 --> 42:16.367
[Rosanna] <i>Family reputation</i>
<i>is very important</i>
<i>among the Amish.</i>

42:16.367 --> 42:20.000
[Johnny] <i>Me and Rose are</i>
<i>trying to get on the</i>
<i>Bishop's good side.</i>

42:22.667 --> 42:25.266
[Sabrina] Ow, ooh! Ooh, ooh!
