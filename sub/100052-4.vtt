_

00:10.496 --> 00:15.310
_

00:19.546 --> 00:24.069
_

00:24.070 --> 00:28.570
_

00:36.285 --> 00:37.443
Come on, girls, come on.

00:37.444 --> 00:39.312
Oh, my God,

00:39.313 --> 00:41.181
I am being triggered right now.

00:41.182 --> 00:43.683
This house is a lot like
the one I grew up in.

00:43.684 --> 00:46.805
My mother used to make me do
the screwdriver test every week.

00:46.806 --> 00:48.488
- The what?
- Screwdriver test.

00:48.489 --> 00:50.990
If you can't push a six-inch
screwdriver into the lawn,

00:50.991 --> 00:52.825
you are not watering it enough.

00:52.826 --> 00:54.260
So what are we looking at?

00:54.261 --> 00:56.329
A psychological assessment.

00:56.330 --> 00:57.864
And a spiritual one.

00:57.865 --> 01:00.366
Seeing if it can be
dealt with with therapy.

01:00.367 --> 01:01.926
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01.927 --> 01:04.236
- Are your parents home?
- Are you here for my brother?

01:04.236 --> 01:06.973
- We are.
- Mom, Dad!

01:06.974 --> 01:09.342
Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

01:09.343 --> 01:11.878
Um, I'm Tom McCrystal. This is Olive.

01:11.879 --> 01:14.380
- Hey, Olive.
- Uh, come on in, please.

01:14.381 --> 01:15.900
Can I get you anything?

01:15.901 --> 01:18.318
Water? Coffee? Fruit snacks?

01:18.319 --> 01:19.953
We're fairly well-stocked.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.454
Huh. What kind of fruit snacks?

01:21.455 --> 01:22.889
We're fine, thank you.

01:22.890 --> 01:24.791
But we'd love to meet
Eric if that's all right.

01:24.792 --> 01:26.793
This way.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.202 --> 01:38.638
Okay.

01:38.639 --> 01:40.540
Oh, uh,

01:40.541 --> 01:44.410
so, sometimes we need
to sleep in the same room

01:44.411 --> 01:47.213
so that we can lock the door.

01:47.214 --> 01:49.215
- I see.
- Yeah.

01:56.257 --> 01:58.258
Eric?

02:02.396 --> 02:03.830
Eric.

02:03.831 --> 02:05.665
Yes?

02:05.666 --> 02:07.392
It's time for the appointment

02:07.393 --> 02:09.502
we talked about yesterday.

02:19.113 --> 02:21.748
Um, we'll stay out here.

02:22.716 --> 02:24.541
He gets a little agitated

02:24.542 --> 02:26.576
when he sees the baby.

02:51.445 --> 02:54.213
So you're here to evaluate me?

02:55.249 --> 02:57.617
Well, we're here to talk.

02:57.618 --> 02:59.452
I'm David Acosta.

02:59.453 --> 03:01.254
I'm Kristen Bouchard. Hi.

03:01.255 --> 03:03.956
Hi, I'm Ben.

03:03.957 --> 03:06.993
I don't have chairs, but
we can sit on the floor.

03:10.798 --> 03:13.633
Do you know why your
parents called us here, Eric?

03:13.634 --> 03:15.401
Yeah.

03:15.402 --> 03:17.603
Can you tell us what
happened with your big sister?

03:17.604 --> 03:20.006
I bit her.

03:20.007 --> 03:21.774
Really hard.

03:21.775 --> 03:24.110
She was bleeding a lot.

03:24.111 --> 03:26.245
And she cried.

03:26.246 --> 03:28.915
And why did you bite your sister?

03:28.916 --> 03:31.484
Because I wanted to.

03:31.485 --> 03:34.620
Did something happen
that made you want to?

03:36.357 --> 03:37.623
Can you tell us?

03:40.861 --> 03:43.096
We were watching Steven Universe

03:43.097 --> 03:46.699
and she kept laughing
and I wanted her to stop.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.701
It was too loud.

03:48.702 --> 03:51.137
I told her to stop, but she didn't.

03:51.138 --> 03:53.539
But you don't laugh when you hurt.

03:53.540 --> 03:56.916
So you knew you were
hurting her when you bit her?

03:56.917 --> 03:59.276
And how did you feel

03:59.277 --> 04:01.347
when you were doing that to your sister?

04:02.950 --> 04:04.951
Did you...

04:04.952 --> 04:07.320
like hurting her?

04:10.691 --> 04:13.226
Eric, look at me.

04:13.227 --> 04:17.296
Did you like hurting her?

04:17.297 --> 04:18.732
Mm-hmm.

04:20.742 --> 04:24.311
And what is it you
liked about hurting her?

04:25.691 --> 04:27.549
I don't know.

04:27.550 --> 04:30.704
It's kind of like watching
a story I made on my own.

04:30.705 --> 04:32.629
Like, at school,

04:32.630 --> 04:36.416
there's this kid in my class
that I'm always stuck next to.

04:36.417 --> 04:38.912
Because my last name's McCrystal,

04:38.913 --> 04:41.320
and his last name's McCray.

04:41.321 --> 04:44.312
So, on our last field
trip to Grand Central,

04:44.313 --> 04:46.071
we played dare or dare.

04:46.072 --> 04:48.298
And I made him jump
onto the train tracks

04:48.299 --> 04:50.279
and count to 42 before he could get up.

04:52.332 --> 04:54.033
But then one of our teachers

04:54.034 --> 04:55.902
grabbed him before the train came.

04:55.903 --> 04:58.504
Did you want him to
get hit by the train?

04:59.873 --> 05:01.707
Even though that could have

05:01.708 --> 05:05.278
hurt him really badly, or even kill him?

05:05.279 --> 05:06.946
I guess.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.394
You got good taste in comics.

05:21.395 --> 05:23.896
You ever read any of the
Ochre 7 collection?

05:23.897 --> 05:27.099
- No.
- It's a story about immortal kids

05:27.100 --> 05:29.869
who play hide-and-seek through time.

05:29.870 --> 05:32.305
I'm surprised you
haven't read any of it.

05:32.306 --> 05:35.575
In volume four, Simona
dares Patrick to jump onto

05:35.576 --> 05:38.911
the railroad tracks and count
to 42 before he can get off.

05:41.081 --> 05:44.217
Maybe I did read that one and forgot.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.919
Eric was...

05:46.920 --> 05:49.189
was loving and caring.

05:49.190 --> 05:50.723
He was totally different.

05:50.724 --> 05:52.124
And then...

05:52.125 --> 05:53.793
When did he change?

05:53.794 --> 05:55.394
Two years ago.

05:55.395 --> 05:59.078
It snuck up on us. A-a
tantrum here, a fib there.

05:59.079 --> 06:00.746
- Are you a mother?
- Yes.

06:00.747 --> 06:03.545
You know how you just
write it off as kid stuff.

06:03.546 --> 06:06.138
Then it accumulates, and now

06:06.139 --> 06:08.741
it's a struggle to remember who he was.

06:08.742 --> 06:11.965
What about the, uh, locks on
the cupboards and the fridge?

06:11.966 --> 06:13.980
He tried to poison us.

06:13.981 --> 06:16.340
- Why?
- He said he was doing

06:16.341 --> 06:19.585
an experiment, and he wanted
to see how long it would take us

06:19.586 --> 06:22.288
to feel the liquid bleach in the milk.

06:24.070 --> 06:26.592
Luckily we had a nanny
cam that saw what he did.

06:26.593 --> 06:28.694
Have you had him
psychologically evaluated?

06:28.695 --> 06:31.264
12 times.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.571
But the psychologists don't agree.

06:33.572 --> 06:35.362
Any medications?

06:35.363 --> 06:37.770
Uh, antidepressants, ADHD,

06:37.771 --> 06:39.076
O.D.D.

06:39.077 --> 06:41.068
- 23 separate protocols.
- Yeah,

06:41.069 --> 06:44.326
and some have worked for a time,
but then he outgrows them.

06:44.327 --> 06:46.479
He's been institutionalized twice.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.382
And the police were sent
to his school three times.

06:49.383 --> 06:50.616
These are the police reports.

06:50.617 --> 06:51.891
I hate to suggest this,

06:51.892 --> 06:54.053
- but there are federal programs.
- _

06:54.054 --> 06:57.123
Yes, and they took Eric for a week

06:57.124 --> 06:58.958
before they asked us
to come pick him up.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.560
They're supposed to take everybody,

07:00.561 --> 07:02.194
but they won't take Eric.

07:02.195 --> 07:04.897
I mean, we've been
at this for two years.

07:04.898 --> 07:06.899
And we're just...

07:09.202 --> 07:11.837
God, I didn't want to do this.

07:11.838 --> 07:15.474
We just need someone to help us.

07:15.475 --> 07:18.311
We're not very good Catholics.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.914
But Eric has something inside him.

07:21.915 --> 07:24.167
A demon.

07:24.168 --> 07:26.026
I never thought that I would say that.

07:26.027 --> 07:28.821
But I believe it now.

07:28.822 --> 07:33.893
Something changed Eric two years
ago, and it wants to kill us.

07:33.894 --> 07:37.530
And that is why we need your help.

07:41.501 --> 07:44.270
This is a nightmare.

07:44.271 --> 07:45.872
We have to get our own psych eval

07:45.873 --> 07:47.573
before I can request any Church action.

07:47.574 --> 07:48.983
Yeah, I'll get on it.

07:48.984 --> 07:51.944
Guys, there's a chance
this is environmental.

07:51.945 --> 07:54.747
Okay? The oldest daughter, she
had a greenish tint in her hair.

07:54.748 --> 07:56.349
That's from acidity.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.607
There's oxidized metal
particles in the water.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.087
That is like copper piping.

08:01.088 --> 08:03.389
Okay? And they moved here two years ago.

08:03.390 --> 08:05.625
That's when the kid
started to act differently.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.761
It's possible.

08:08.762 --> 08:11.597
Overexposure to copper can
cause psychiatric symptoms.

08:11.598 --> 08:13.866
You look into it, and we'll get
our own psych eval with Eric.

08:13.867 --> 08:16.569
- Great.
- Ben.

08:16.570 --> 08:19.705
Could you check my house
for metal corrosion?

08:19.706 --> 08:21.107
Yeah, your kids psychos?

08:21.883 --> 08:22.907
Mom, we're home.

08:22.908 --> 08:24.377
- Mom, I'm so hungry.
- Mom!

08:24.378 --> 08:26.278
My stomach is literally killing me.

08:26.279 --> 08:27.713
- Mom, we're home!
- Mom, where are you?!

08:27.714 --> 08:29.548
- Where's Mom?
- Hey, quiet. No, no, no.

08:29.549 --> 08:31.083
Hey, hey, hey. Quiet, quiet.

08:31.084 --> 08:32.485
What is this?

08:34.121 --> 08:35.621
Good, I have your attention.

08:35.621 --> 08:37.456
All right, now listen very carefully.

08:37.457 --> 08:40.726
Your mother's still at work, and
I've got a pair of eights. See?

08:40.727 --> 08:42.581
- Mm-hmm.
- There are Pop-Tarts in the kitchen.

08:42.582 --> 08:46.165
And since I can't remember
any of your birthdays, these.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.967
- Oh, my gosh!
- No, let go!

08:47.968 --> 08:49.468
My birthday's the closest!

08:49.469 --> 08:51.904
Good, good... no, no, no.
Don't-don't thank me.

08:51.905 --> 08:53.739
Thank you so much, Grandma. Open it.

08:53.740 --> 08:55.908
Now, listen, if you can't keep
quiet, I'm taking them away.

08:55.909 --> 08:57.234
I want to hold it.

08:57.235 --> 08:59.078
Oh, my gosh, I know what these are.

08:59.079 --> 09:00.346
Augmented reality goggles.

09:00.347 --> 09:01.981
There's a girl at school who has them.

09:01.982 --> 09:03.516
- Grandma, these are great.
- I know.

09:03.517 --> 09:06.152
Now, everybody, kiss me on
my cheek and then go play.

09:06.153 --> 09:08.030
Okay? But please don't kill anyone.

09:08.031 --> 09:09.506
- No killing.
- Mwah!

09:14.241 --> 09:15.428
_

09:15.429 --> 09:17.496
- Okay, we can try World Trip,
- _

09:17.497 --> 09:19.265
- Block the Blocks,
- _

09:19.266 --> 09:21.000
- Bunny Hopp...
- The Haunted Girl.

09:21.001 --> 09:23.325
The Haunted Girl!
The Haunted Girl!

09:23.326 --> 09:25.304
_

09:25.305 --> 09:26.972
- Let us see. We want to see.
- _

09:26.973 --> 09:29.208
We just put them on, we're all sharing.

09:29.209 --> 09:30.441
- Stop it!
- Why does sharing mean

09:30.442 --> 09:31.697
you guys get to go first?

09:31.698 --> 09:33.312
'Cause we're the oldest.

09:33.313 --> 09:36.039
- Whoa, what do we do now?
- _

09:36.040 --> 09:37.498
- Grandma said it was all right
- _

09:37.499 --> 09:39.090
- to use them, so I think it's okay.
- _

09:39.091 --> 09:40.208
- Why, what does it say?
- _

09:40.209 --> 09:42.468
- Nothing, just if we're old enough.
- _

09:42.469 --> 09:43.960
- What's it say now?
- _

09:43.961 --> 09:45.391
- It's asking if we're pregnant.
- _

09:45.392 --> 09:49.351
- What?
- Well, we're not, so...

09:49.352 --> 09:51.063
_

09:51.064 --> 09:53.199
Whoa.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.800
Oh, my God.

09:54.801 --> 09:56.635
- What, what is it?
- Let me have it.

09:56.636 --> 09:57.670
It's so weird.

09:57.671 --> 09:59.474
It's just our room,
but there are spiderwebs

09:59.475 --> 10:01.474
and... and spiders! There are spiders.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.532
What? Where?

10:02.533 --> 10:04.210
- We want to see.
- No, just wait, just wait, wait.

10:04.211 --> 10:06.312
Oh, my God.

10:06.313 --> 10:08.864
It's our turn, it's been
five minutes! Come on!

10:08.865 --> 10:11.767
- Let us try.
- Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait, no, no, no, no.

10:11.768 --> 10:13.010
_

10:13.011 --> 10:15.670
- Wait, should we?
- Yes.

10:15.671 --> 10:17.605
- What?
- It wants us to turn out the lights.

10:23.764 --> 10:25.064
Oh, my God!

10:25.065 --> 10:26.665
- What is it?
- A spider,

10:26.666 --> 10:28.234
- in the hall.
- Giant.

10:28.235 --> 10:30.026
- Massive.
- I think it's my turn.

10:30.027 --> 10:31.437
- It's our turn!
- Wait, wait, wait.

10:31.438 --> 10:33.072
- Stop it, stop it, Laura.
- Can I have it?

10:33.073 --> 10:34.764
- Stop it right now.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,

10:34.765 --> 10:36.942
- stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
- This is insane.

10:36.943 --> 10:40.079
It's so real, so real.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.280
So real.

10:43.016 --> 10:45.050
- Should we?
- _

10:45.051 --> 10:47.219
It's just our bathroom.

10:49.288 --> 10:51.012
Close it!

10:51.013 --> 10:53.272
- Oh, my gosh! Oh, ew!
- He's coming, he's coming...

10:53.273 --> 10:55.193
- Close it quickly!
- He's coming, he's coming...

10:56.120 --> 10:57.866
- Close it, close it! Close it!
- He's coming, he's coming,

10:57.867 --> 10:59.198
- he's coming.
- Close it!

10:59.199 --> 11:02.368
What?

11:02.369 --> 11:04.136
- It's our turn now.
- Hold this.

11:04.137 --> 11:06.494
I'll help you. Okay. Just
know that none of this is real.

11:06.495 --> 11:09.150
So is it a game, or what? What do I do?

11:09.151 --> 11:11.176
I don't know. We didn't get far enough.

11:11.177 --> 11:13.870
Just don't get scared.

11:13.871 --> 11:16.897
This isn't scary. I don't see anything.

11:16.898 --> 11:18.422
- Open the bathroom door.
- _

11:18.423 --> 11:19.447
Just know that it's not real.

11:19.448 --> 11:21.106
- Don't get scared.
- Go on.

11:21.107 --> 11:23.366
It's fine, Laura, you can do it.

11:23.367 --> 11:26.002
Come on.

11:31.898 --> 11:33.732
What? It's just our bathroom.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.501
You don't see it? The guy
with the butcher knife?

11:35.502 --> 11:37.236
- He was just there.
- Yeah.

11:37.237 --> 11:39.138
- No.
- He was right there a second ago.

11:39.139 --> 11:41.398
- No. There's nothing.
- Seriously?

11:41.399 --> 11:43.976
- You guys were making it all up!
- No, we weren't.

11:43.977 --> 11:46.278
- It was right there!
- Yes, you were!

11:48.615 --> 11:50.482
- You think we'd lie about this stuff?
- Look!

11:50.483 --> 11:51.851
There's nothing here!

11:51.852 --> 11:54.420
Yeah. I think these are
broken. They don't work.

11:54.421 --> 11:55.754
They're not broken,
just wait one second.

11:55.755 --> 11:58.090
- Just look around...
- What are we supposed to see?

11:58.091 --> 11:59.325
Something scary.

12:00.427 --> 12:01.694
What? Did you hear something?

12:01.695 --> 12:02.995
What is it?

12:04.598 --> 12:05.931
Uh-huh.

12:08.034 --> 12:09.435
Do you see something?

12:12.955 --> 12:14.355
What is it?

12:14.356 --> 12:16.390
What is it? What do you see?

12:16.391 --> 12:17.391
- What do you see?
- What is it?

12:17.392 --> 12:19.193
Lexis, you're okay! Lexis, you're okay!

12:22.564 --> 12:23.631
What is it?

12:23.632 --> 12:26.267
Lexis, Lexis, Lexis, Lexis, you're okay.

12:26.268 --> 12:27.293
What do you see?

12:28.786 --> 12:31.072
Laura, there's nothing,
okay? There's nothing.

12:31.073 --> 12:33.024
It's all fake, okay?
There's nothing there.

12:33.025 --> 12:34.041
Laura, there's nothing.

12:34.042 --> 12:36.077
Laura, where are you going?

12:36.078 --> 12:38.746
Laura, where are you going? Laura!

12:52.060 --> 12:53.861
What's going on?

12:53.862 --> 12:55.530
What are these? Where'd you get 'em?

12:56.216 --> 12:57.884
Honey, are you okay?

12:59.165 --> 13:01.290
I-I got 'em as a communal gift.

13:01.291 --> 13:03.783
- I thought they'd like 'em.
- Switch to Bunny Hopp.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.408
They're-they're cool.
You should try them on.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.575
- Yeah, look, Mom. Take a look.
- They're super cool.

13:07.576 --> 13:08.834
Sweetheart, what's the matter?

13:08.835 --> 13:10.369
See, it's-it's like Pokémon Go.

13:10.370 --> 13:12.079
- You just hunt bunnies.
- Yeah, they're fun.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.080
See?

13:14.616 --> 13:16.217
Then, why was your sister screaming?

13:16.218 --> 13:18.710
- She's a little baby.
- Shut up!

13:18.711 --> 13:20.684
Because she doesn't
like whacking bunnies

13:20.685 --> 13:23.124
- on the head.
- Okay, here's the deal.

13:23.125 --> 13:25.063
You can play with these,
but not on the stairs

13:25.064 --> 13:26.861
and only after you do
your homework, okay?

13:26.862 --> 13:28.596
- Okay, we'll start our homework right now.
- Come on, guys.

13:28.597 --> 13:30.410
- I'm not scared anymore.
- Good.

13:30.411 --> 13:33.134
- All right, dinner. Let's go.
- Good, honey. Let's go. Dinner.

13:33.135 --> 13:36.971
- Mom, what's for dinner?
- Um, we are going to have...

13:36.972 --> 13:38.940
It's Grandma's special.

14:03.773 --> 14:04.906
Tired.

14:04.907 --> 14:06.908
Good.

14:08.443 --> 14:10.611
Surprised.

14:10.612 --> 14:13.080
Good.

14:13.081 --> 14:15.416
Do I have to do these anymore?

14:15.417 --> 14:16.617
Yes, you do.

14:16.618 --> 14:17.819
They're stupid.

14:20.413 --> 14:22.247
Eric, please sit down.

14:22.248 --> 14:25.317
What other graphic novels do you like?

14:25.318 --> 14:26.835
We can discuss every

14:26.836 --> 14:29.287
graphic novel that's ever been written

14:29.288 --> 14:31.890
as soon as you're finished with Kristen.

14:34.093 --> 14:36.094
Hey, welcome back.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.401
I don't know.

14:42.402 --> 14:43.502
Really?

14:43.503 --> 14:45.604
You want to take another look?

14:45.605 --> 14:48.640
So you don't feel any change at all?

14:49.842 --> 14:53.278
Something in you?
Something influencing you?

14:53.279 --> 14:54.780
No.

15:01.020 --> 15:03.188
Recognize this?

15:03.189 --> 15:05.490
What is it?

15:05.491 --> 15:07.659
Blessed rosary.

15:10.596 --> 15:12.030
Why don't you take it?

15:12.031 --> 15:14.631
No.

15:14.632 --> 15:16.535
That's okay if you don't want to.

15:16.536 --> 15:18.603
I can understand you being scared.

15:20.807 --> 15:22.708
I'm not scared.

15:24.777 --> 15:27.312
Why don't you pick it up?

15:41.835 --> 15:44.170
"I like to be where
exciting things happen."

15:46.499 --> 15:49.367
"I do not care if I get
into trouble at school."

15:50.737 --> 15:52.137
Thy Kingdom come...

15:52.138 --> 15:55.540
Thy will be done,

15:55.541 --> 15:58.350
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

15:58.351 --> 15:59.745
Why are we at church?

15:59.746 --> 16:01.146
This is where I work.

16:01.147 --> 16:02.581
I don't like it here.

16:02.582 --> 16:04.716
Why?

16:04.717 --> 16:06.351
It's dark.

16:06.352 --> 16:09.354
Too bad. Repeat the words.

16:09.355 --> 16:11.723
Do you like me?

16:14.227 --> 16:16.194
I don't think I've decided.

16:16.195 --> 16:18.430
Do you think I have a demon in me?

16:22.235 --> 16:24.836
I don't think I've decided.

16:24.837 --> 16:26.671
If I do have a demon in me,

16:26.672 --> 16:29.407
is there anything you can do?

16:30.443 --> 16:32.778
I can try.

16:32.779 --> 16:34.780
Do you want that?

16:34.781 --> 16:36.915
I don't know.

16:40.219 --> 16:41.620
He scored high on the

16:41.621 --> 16:44.189
callous-unemotional
factor: 53 out of 80.

16:44.190 --> 16:47.859
The grandiose-manipulative
factor: 41 out of 60.

16:47.860 --> 16:50.061
Any treatment possibilities?

16:50.062 --> 16:53.532
Well, it's hard, but you try to
teach the child what they lack:

16:53.533 --> 16:56.368
- remorse and empathy.
- How do you do that?

16:56.369 --> 16:58.236
You show them what remorse
looks like in others

16:58.237 --> 17:00.768
and explain that there's
a greater advantage

17:00.769 --> 17:02.026
if they imitate it.

17:02.027 --> 17:04.075
So, in the end they're
really not remorseful,

17:04.076 --> 17:05.977
they're just faking it?

17:05.978 --> 17:07.878
Yes, but hopefully
what starts as imitation

17:07.880 --> 17:09.381
becomes learned behavior.

17:09.382 --> 17:12.117
"Fake it until you make it"?

17:12.117 --> 17:13.885
Sure.

17:13.886 --> 17:16.421
What about you?

17:16.422 --> 17:18.589
- Any hope from your end?
- There might be some

17:18.590 --> 17:20.458
demonic oppression.

17:20.459 --> 17:21.660
Can't be sure.

17:21.661 --> 17:23.228
It's hard to tell with a nine-year-old.

17:23.229 --> 17:25.630
This family doesn't want
to hear about more therapy.

17:25.631 --> 17:27.165
They want to hear it's supernatural.

17:27.165 --> 17:29.801
I know.

17:32.305 --> 17:33.839
Do you think God could ever create

17:33.840 --> 17:35.807
a nine-year-old psychopath?

17:37.476 --> 17:40.345
No.

17:40.346 --> 17:42.981
So there should always be hope?

17:44.016 --> 17:47.512
Yes, in redemption.

17:47.513 --> 17:49.821
And how do you teach a
child to want redemption?

17:51.858 --> 17:54.326
"Fake it until you make it."

18:03.636 --> 18:05.704
I got a question for you.

18:05.705 --> 18:08.106
I have a question for you.

18:08.107 --> 18:10.175
Go ahead.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.444
Why are you her friend?

18:12.445 --> 18:14.312
Kristen?

18:14.313 --> 18:16.815
I don't trust her.

18:16.816 --> 18:19.451
I think you'd trust her
if you got to know her.

18:25.157 --> 18:28.493
What do you think you want
to be when you get older?

18:28.494 --> 18:30.195
When you're an adult.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.864
- Comic book artist.
- Yeah?

18:35.401 --> 18:36.635
I did as a kid, too.

18:36.636 --> 18:38.870
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:38.871 --> 18:41.206
Well, if that's what you want,

18:41.207 --> 18:43.541
you know you got to play by the rules.

18:43.542 --> 18:45.810
That's what I did.

18:45.811 --> 18:48.079
And I know you don't feel the way

18:48.080 --> 18:49.748
other people want you to feel.

18:49.749 --> 18:53.151
I understand, but that's
why you got to pretend,

18:53.152 --> 18:56.554
at least some of the times.

18:56.555 --> 18:58.390
What do you mean, pretend?

18:58.391 --> 19:02.093
When you see someone crying,

19:02.094 --> 19:03.929
cry with them.

19:03.930 --> 19:07.232
When you see someone
laugh, laugh with them.

19:07.233 --> 19:11.336
Watch what other people
do, watch what they expect,

19:11.337 --> 19:12.737
and then do that.

19:12.738 --> 19:15.440
Because you got to work with
other people to draw comics,

19:15.441 --> 19:19.177
but they won't want to work with
you unless you follow the rules.

19:19.178 --> 19:24.115
And maybe you'll end up like
me, not minding the rules.

19:24.116 --> 19:26.084
They won't seem like
so much work anymore

19:26.085 --> 19:28.420
because you'll be on the inside of 'em,

19:28.421 --> 19:30.355
not the outside.

19:30.356 --> 19:33.692
And I know this all seems like

19:33.693 --> 19:35.427
it's pretty hard,

19:35.428 --> 19:38.229
but you know what helps
me follow the rules?

19:38.230 --> 19:40.932
Even on days when I don't want to?

19:43.069 --> 19:45.270
Yeah.

19:45.271 --> 19:48.306
I know, but it works.

19:48.307 --> 19:49.808
Praying?

19:49.809 --> 19:52.877
Don't call it prayer.

19:52.878 --> 19:56.047
Just tell God what you want.

19:56.048 --> 19:58.883
And he'll give it to me?

19:58.884 --> 20:02.320
He'll give it to you if you have faith

20:02.321 --> 20:04.422
and act upon it.

20:17.169 --> 20:18.685
Hey, don't freak out

20:18.686 --> 20:20.472
when you see a strange
man in your bathroom.

20:20.473 --> 20:22.890
Your, uh, mom asked me
to come look at the pipes

20:22.891 --> 20:24.976
and your grandma let me in.

20:24.977 --> 20:27.412
- Hey.
- So, is the shower broken?

20:27.413 --> 20:30.415
No, no, it's, uh, your
mother's just worried

20:30.416 --> 20:32.016
that you're gonna turn into psychopaths.

20:35.721 --> 20:37.422
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

20:37.423 --> 20:39.190
hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.

20:39.191 --> 20:40.992
Time out, time out.

20:40.993 --> 20:43.428
Have you guys ever noticed that

20:43.429 --> 20:46.397
when you all talk at the same
time, no one can understand you?

20:49.201 --> 20:50.635
What's your name?

20:50.636 --> 20:52.937
Ben the Magnificent. What's yours?

20:52.938 --> 20:54.439
- Laura. - Lynn.
- Lexis. - Lila.

20:54.440 --> 20:57.149
Okay, well, that cleared things up.

20:57.150 --> 21:00.352
- Is that really your name?
- Yeah.

21:04.710 --> 21:07.112
You know, I, uh, I like those stars.

21:07.113 --> 21:08.713
Yeah. Who did those?

21:08.714 --> 21:10.282
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

21:10.283 --> 21:11.683
- You just hung them.
- I cut them out.

21:11.684 --> 21:13.051
- Well, I cut them up.
- No, you...

21:15.121 --> 21:17.174
All right, okay. Okay!

21:17.175 --> 21:20.076
All right, stop, stop, stop.

21:20.077 --> 21:22.848
All right, that's enough.
I-I-I really have to do this,

21:22.849 --> 21:24.038
and you guys probably have...

21:24.039 --> 21:26.064
- Yeah, we've all got homework.
- ... to do things.

21:26.065 --> 21:27.317
Yeah.

21:27.318 --> 21:30.086
Just... homework.

21:30.087 --> 21:31.821
Let me try again.

21:31.822 --> 21:33.957
Laura, it terrified you the last time.

21:33.958 --> 21:36.193
- No, now I know how to use 'em.
- Well,

21:36.194 --> 21:39.029
first we're going to see
if there's anything scary.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.416
Is there anything scary?

21:40.417 --> 21:42.132
You didn't let me put it on.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.667
- Now is there anything?
- _

21:43.668 --> 21:44.935
- One second.
- _

21:49.106 --> 21:50.473
I'll get it with the fireball.

21:50.474 --> 21:54.110
- What fireball?
- I looked online how to play.

21:54.111 --> 21:55.946
- Awesome.
- This is so cool.

21:55.947 --> 21:57.696
This is so cool.

21:59.050 --> 22:00.306
Wait, look.

22:00.307 --> 22:02.986
_

22:02.987 --> 22:05.689
- Who's Rose390?
- _

22:05.690 --> 22:07.958
- I don't know. Maybe she knows more.
- Wait, maybe we shouldn't.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.659
- Shouldn't what? Is there someone else on it?
- Who is it?

22:09.660 --> 22:12.018
- What is it?
- We can always turn it off.

22:12.019 --> 22:14.443
_

22:14.444 --> 22:16.445
Hello.

22:22.139 --> 22:24.307
Hi?

22:24.308 --> 22:26.309
I'm Lila.

22:26.310 --> 22:28.511
I'm Rose.

22:28.512 --> 22:29.879
Do you want to play?

22:29.880 --> 22:32.515
W-We just started. We don't know how.

22:32.516 --> 22:34.551
Have you seen the board?

22:34.552 --> 22:37.721
What board?

22:37.722 --> 22:41.224
It's probably in there.
Go ahead and open it.

22:41.225 --> 22:43.226
I can't touch anything in your house.

22:43.227 --> 22:45.362
I can only see.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.356
There it is.

23:13.357 --> 23:14.557
In the corner.

23:23.467 --> 23:26.236
Wh-What do you do to it?

23:26.237 --> 23:28.416
Open it like you're opening a book.

23:28.417 --> 23:29.618
And what will it do?

23:33.811 --> 23:36.446
- Whoa.
- See?

23:36.447 --> 23:38.782
- That's how you get to the next level.
- _

23:38.783 --> 23:41.551
- What's the next level?
- Everything.

23:41.552 --> 23:45.255
It's so fun. Put your hands
on the pointer, like this.

23:45.256 --> 23:47.924
I'll put my hands on this side.

23:47.925 --> 23:50.260
I don't think they should do this.

23:50.261 --> 23:51.995
Me, too.

23:51.996 --> 23:55.632
Slide it around so it lands on "hello".

24:10.147 --> 24:11.948
Okay, now what?

24:11.949 --> 24:15.952
We say "Hail, hail, hail" three times,

24:15.953 --> 24:17.854
but we have to say it together.

24:17.855 --> 24:20.290
- Okay?
- Who are you?

24:20.291 --> 24:23.360
Just a normal girl playing like you.

24:27.098 --> 24:28.598
And what does it do?

24:28.599 --> 24:30.834
Look, I'll start.

24:30.835 --> 24:32.035
Hail, hail...

24:32.036 --> 24:34.871
Hail, hail, hail.

24:34.872 --> 24:36.473
Good, here he comes.

24:37.708 --> 24:39.943
Here he comes. Here he comes.

24:39.944 --> 24:41.945
Now we can really play.

24:47.981 --> 24:50.432
Hail, hail, hail, here he comes.

24:50.433 --> 24:53.382
Hail, hail, hail, here he comes.

24:53.383 --> 24:56.585
Hail, hail, hail, here he comes.

24:56.586 --> 25:00.188
Hail, hail, hail, here he comes.

25:00.189 --> 25:01.623
Hail, hail, hail,

25:01.624 --> 25:03.025
- here he comes.
- Hey.

25:03.026 --> 25:05.727
- Hail, hail, hail, here he comes.
- Hey.

25:05.728 --> 25:07.719
Hail, hail, hail,

25:07.720 --> 25:09.264
here he comes.

25:09.265 --> 25:11.400
Hail, hail, hail, here he...

25:11.401 --> 25:13.302
Hey. What are you guys doing?

25:13.303 --> 25:16.071
- Nothing.
- We were just playing.

25:16.072 --> 25:17.739
Yeah? What are you playing?

25:17.740 --> 25:19.574
Just a game.

25:20.610 --> 25:22.144
Can I see?

25:27.941 --> 25:30.112
Oh, okay.

25:30.113 --> 25:32.490
Uh, I-I'm not your mom,

25:32.491 --> 25:36.261
but this is not an
appropriate game for kids.

25:37.260 --> 25:39.061
This is, uh,

25:39.062 --> 25:41.129
- an M.A. game.
- We were done playing anyway.

25:41.130 --> 25:42.409
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.797
- Daughters!
- Okay, well, I think...

25:43.798 --> 25:45.024
Mom!

25:51.574 --> 25:53.408
- I didn't expect you to be home so early.
- This is so unusual...

25:53.409 --> 25:55.036
Why are you home so early?

25:55.037 --> 25:56.178
Your friend's upstairs.

25:56.179 --> 25:58.030
- Oh, good, Ben's here.
- Ben the Magnificent.

25:58.031 --> 25:59.342
He's fixing the shower.

25:59.343 --> 26:01.650
Ben the Magnificent, huh?
Have you been nice to him?

26:01.651 --> 26:02.784
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

26:02.785 --> 26:05.921
We were playing a
game we shouldn't have.

26:05.922 --> 26:09.024
- An adult game.
- Lynn...

26:09.025 --> 26:11.333
I didn't get to. I-I didn't get to play.

26:11.334 --> 26:12.661
- Yes, you did.
- No...

26:12.662 --> 26:14.788
Look, you're holding the controllers.

26:14.789 --> 26:16.090
- That's proof.
- Just because I'm holding it

26:16.091 --> 26:17.791
- doesn't mean...
- I didn't get to play.

26:22.413 --> 26:24.281
It's called The Haunted Girl.

26:24.282 --> 26:26.112
So it's an adult game?

26:26.113 --> 26:27.827
Well, it's an M.A. game.

26:27.828 --> 26:29.753
It's really not that scary.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.154
Yes, but they lied to me.

26:31.155 --> 26:34.174
No, she just told the
truth, and that wasn't

26:34.175 --> 26:36.742
- the easiest thing for her to do.
- She only told the truth

26:36.743 --> 26:38.529
because she was afraid
you were gonna tell me.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.264
- Well...
- It's like with Eric's mother.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.024
- It starts with a small fib.
- Look, if you want me

26:43.025 --> 26:45.014
to make these things
child-protected, I can.

26:45.015 --> 26:47.304
And then all they can do
is play the bunny game.

26:47.305 --> 26:49.306
- Or I just throw 'em out.
- Yeah.

26:49.307 --> 26:51.008
I mean, my parents
threw out my video games

26:51.009 --> 26:52.543
and I went to my friend's house.

26:54.479 --> 26:57.481
Okay, well, if you don't mind,
please, child-protect 'em.

26:57.482 --> 26:58.882
Okay.

26:58.883 --> 27:00.817
Any word on our pipes?

27:00.818 --> 27:03.620
- Uh, you are okay. No copper.
- _

27:03.621 --> 27:05.022
Really?

27:05.023 --> 27:06.323
No toxicity?

27:06.324 --> 27:08.659
No. Your children are happy

27:08.660 --> 27:11.161
and healthy, and you're a good mother.

27:11.162 --> 27:12.629
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.232
I mean, they just lied to me.

27:15.233 --> 27:17.234
And what about the
pipes in Eric's house?

27:17.235 --> 27:19.169
Uh, I don't know yet. I'm still looking.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.004
Okay.

27:21.005 --> 27:23.840
Thanks, Ben the Magnificent.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.698
_

27:34.385 --> 27:35.852
What are you doing?

27:35.853 --> 27:37.721
Who are you?

27:37.722 --> 27:41.158
None of your business.
What are you doing?

27:41.159 --> 27:43.694
I'm getting rid of you, Rose390.

27:43.695 --> 27:45.929
It won't work.

27:45.930 --> 27:47.564
Yes, it will.

27:47.565 --> 27:49.706
You are a pedophile
with a voice modifier.

27:49.707 --> 27:51.735
And if you ever try
to get in here again,

27:51.736 --> 27:54.227
I am gonna dox you
into the next century.

27:54.228 --> 27:56.828
_

28:43.788 --> 28:46.323
Did you ask him?

28:46.324 --> 28:48.112
No.

28:48.113 --> 28:50.114
What's going on?

28:52.930 --> 28:55.899
Last night I saw him praying.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.567
What? Why?

28:57.568 --> 28:59.569
I don't know.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.075
Will you check my work, Mom?

29:09.981 --> 29:13.183
You've been good, Eric.

29:13.184 --> 29:15.686
I like David.

29:15.687 --> 29:17.921
The man who was here?

29:17.922 --> 29:19.456
Yes.

29:19.457 --> 29:24.094
He said if I wanted something,
I-I should talk to God.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.930
And what do you want?

29:26.931 --> 29:31.702
A tutor who will show
me how to draw comics.

29:33.137 --> 29:35.138
I'll see what I can do.

29:37.608 --> 29:40.210
That's great news.

29:40.211 --> 29:43.814
Um, I-I can help if you want.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.849
I-I know some of the basics,

29:45.850 --> 29:47.851
and I know some comic book artists.

29:47.852 --> 29:50.954
That's so good to hear.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.190
He likes you, David.

29:53.191 --> 29:56.193
And I feel like he's taken
to something you said.

29:56.194 --> 29:58.729
Um, what is that?

29:58.730 --> 30:01.798
Uh, asking God for something he wants.

30:01.799 --> 30:05.091
Okay. I'll come on
over with my drawings,

30:05.092 --> 30:07.070
and I'll start him off on the basics.

30:07.071 --> 30:08.205
Thank you so much.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.372
I'll see you soon.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.059
David.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.927
Don't let me interrupt.

30:30.928 --> 30:33.396
No, I'm finished.

30:33.397 --> 30:34.571
I'm glad you came.

30:34.572 --> 30:36.700
I thought we could do a little tutorial.

30:36.701 --> 30:38.935
- Want to go inside?
- No.

30:38.936 --> 30:41.004
Out here is good.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.375
It's a little bright.

30:48.412 --> 30:50.514
What's going on, Eric?

30:50.515 --> 30:52.382
Nothing.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.119
What were you praying for?

30:56.120 --> 30:58.121
You said it wasn't praying.

30:58.122 --> 31:00.423
It was just asking God for something.

31:02.811 --> 31:04.245
What were you asking... ?

31:46.304 --> 31:48.972
No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God, no.

31:48.973 --> 31:50.273
No, no, no, no, no.

31:50.274 --> 31:51.675
No, oh, God...

31:51.676 --> 31:53.543
Come here, come here, baby...

31:53.544 --> 31:56.179
Hi, hi, hi.

31:56.180 --> 31:59.082
There's been a drowning at 9023 Broxton.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.186
We need paramedics immediately!

32:07.491 --> 32:09.092
What were you doing?!

32:09.093 --> 32:13.530
You told me if I had
faith and acted upon it,

32:13.531 --> 32:15.165
God would hear me.

32:15.166 --> 32:16.600
Hear you for what?

32:18.636 --> 32:20.971
I was asking to take her away.

32:32.016 --> 32:34.347
You're seeking an emergency exorcism?

32:34.348 --> 32:36.629
The child tried to kill his
little sister by drowning her.

32:38.214 --> 32:39.938
Under compulsion?

32:39.939 --> 32:42.608
I-I don't think he was doing
it through his own free will.

32:42.609 --> 32:45.544
And what do you think, Ms. Bouchard?

32:49.449 --> 32:52.251
I think he shows psychopathic behaviors,

32:52.252 --> 32:56.172
but ultimately I don't think
I can ever really explain why

32:56.173 --> 32:58.715
- he's driven to kill.
- Well, I'm only allowed

32:58.716 --> 33:01.560
to move forward if this
is a spiritual disturbance

33:01.561 --> 33:02.753
and not a psychological one.

33:02.754 --> 33:07.266
The parents want an exorcism.
They have tried everything.

33:07.267 --> 33:09.276
They think there is a demon inside him.

33:09.277 --> 33:11.737
And you think psychology has
nothing more to offer him?

33:13.506 --> 33:15.774
Look, if I were honest
with you, Father...

33:15.775 --> 33:17.109
Please.

33:17.110 --> 33:19.778
Psychology always thinks
there's more to do,

33:19.779 --> 33:23.348
but this family will be
murdered before we find results.

33:23.349 --> 33:24.407
All right, then,

33:24.408 --> 33:27.176
tell them to be prepared
for tomorrow. I'll be there.

33:29.689 --> 33:31.089
Thank you.

33:32.458 --> 33:35.327
Well, there's nothing
I said I don't believe.

33:40.433 --> 33:42.601
I think we should get a drink sometime.

33:44.804 --> 33:47.005
I'd like that.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.676
What are you doing?

34:24.677 --> 34:27.312
I'm sleeping.

34:27.313 --> 34:29.815
Don't you want to finish the game?

34:29.815 --> 34:30.983
What game?

34:32.018 --> 34:34.018
Who are you talking to?

34:34.020 --> 34:35.679
No one. Just go back to sleep.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.724
- Why do you have those back on?
- Don't. I-It's nothing.

34:40.493 --> 34:43.195
- Hey, it's her.
- It's me.

34:43.196 --> 34:46.164
- The game's not done yet. Come on back.
- We can't.

34:46.165 --> 34:47.565
We can only play rabbits.

34:47.567 --> 34:50.068
I'll show you how to
take off the child lock.

34:50.069 --> 34:52.337
We're not supposed to.

34:52.338 --> 34:55.072
- I have some bad news.
- What?

34:55.074 --> 34:56.742
It's about your dad.

34:56.743 --> 34:57.800
What about him?

34:57.801 --> 34:59.378
Don't you want to know where he is?

34:59.379 --> 35:01.280
He's on Everest, climbing.

35:01.281 --> 35:03.749
Are you sure?

35:03.750 --> 35:06.018
- I think we should take these off.
- First,

35:06.019 --> 35:09.021
- you should check the board.
- What board?

35:13.927 --> 35:17.763
Come on, don't you want to ask
it what happened to your dad?

35:17.764 --> 35:20.339
Go ahead.

35:20.340 --> 35:22.213
Ask it where your dad is.

35:25.305 --> 35:26.939
Where's my dad?

35:35.648 --> 35:37.749
"Heaven"?

35:37.750 --> 35:40.953
You'll like being an orphan.

35:44.958 --> 35:47.493
- Dad's fine.
- How do you know?

35:47.494 --> 35:49.829
Well, because he texts me every day.

35:49.830 --> 35:51.797
How do you know it's him?

35:51.798 --> 35:54.634
Maybe it's somebody else in
the group writing for him.

35:54.635 --> 35:57.303
Or maybe it was done earlier.

35:57.304 --> 36:01.073
Okay, where is this coming from?

36:01.074 --> 36:03.076
The girl in the game.

36:03.077 --> 36:06.136
The haunted game? I thought
I said you couldn't play?

36:06.137 --> 36:08.881
We didn't. The girl came
into Bunny Hopp.

36:08.882 --> 36:10.516
She found us.

36:10.517 --> 36:12.818
Okay, Lila, I want you to
get those goggles right now.

36:12.819 --> 36:14.487
- But...
- No, now, please.

36:19.192 --> 36:21.527
You know you don't get to
play with them anymore, right?

36:21.528 --> 36:23.996
I know.

36:23.997 --> 36:26.999
Okay, I've got an idea.
Why don't we text Dad,

36:27.000 --> 36:28.834
let him know we're
thinking about him, okay?

36:28.835 --> 36:30.569
Can we send him a video message?

36:30.570 --> 36:32.872
That's even better. Let's do that.

36:32.873 --> 36:36.942
Let's all squish. And... we're on.

36:36.943 --> 36:39.011
Hey, Dad, we're whispering

36:39.012 --> 36:41.047
'cause we don't want to
wake up Lexis and Laura.

36:41.048 --> 36:43.783
We love you and we're worried about you.

36:43.784 --> 36:46.686
Don't fall off a mountain.

36:46.687 --> 36:49.522
Okay, Mom wants to say something.

36:49.523 --> 36:52.124
Please call us when you
can. We all love you.

36:56.697 --> 36:58.597
Do you love Dad?

36:59.733 --> 37:01.801
Of course I do.

37:01.802 --> 37:04.236
Do you think he loves you?

37:04.237 --> 37:06.238
Yes.

37:06.239 --> 37:08.741
Then why isn't he home?

37:08.742 --> 37:12.645
Well, he's making money for us.
He's guiding people on Everest.

37:12.646 --> 37:14.780
Can't you make the money?

37:14.781 --> 37:17.583
Yes, but it's what Dad does.

37:17.584 --> 37:20.453
I do things here, and
he does things there.

37:20.454 --> 37:24.490
When's he coming home?

37:24.491 --> 37:26.125
In a few weeks.

37:26.126 --> 37:28.461
Now, why don't you just go to sleep?

37:28.462 --> 37:32.098
Dad's fine. He loves you, and he's fine.

37:56.656 --> 37:59.651
So, you ever been to an exorcism before?

37:59.652 --> 38:02.495
- Never.
- Well, it's not what you'd expect.

38:02.496 --> 38:04.597
Long stretches of tedium

38:04.598 --> 38:07.666
interrupted by seconds of sheer terror.

38:23.784 --> 38:25.384
- How's she doing?
- Good.

38:25.385 --> 38:27.486
She's a trooper.

38:27.487 --> 38:29.555
Hopefully she won't
remember what happened.

38:29.556 --> 38:31.414
Are the cops here about yesterday?

38:31.415 --> 38:34.193
No, no, we had an incident.

38:34.194 --> 38:37.730
Uh, this is Father Amara.
He's here for the rite,

38:37.731 --> 38:39.625
- the exorcism.
- Good afternoon.

38:39.626 --> 38:41.914
I-I thought you were talking
something in the pipes.

38:41.915 --> 38:46.818
Uh, there was some corrosion
but not enough for concern.

38:46.819 --> 38:49.144
So the Church has agreed to
your request for an exorcism.

38:49.145 --> 38:52.647
Uh, the police are here
because Eric is missing.

38:52.648 --> 38:54.074
He ran away.

38:54.075 --> 38:55.532
If this isn't his blood,

38:55.533 --> 38:57.892
- whose is it?
- We had nothing to do with that.

38:57.893 --> 38:59.151
That is not his blood.

38:59.152 --> 39:00.810
We need to deal with this right now,

39:00.811 --> 39:02.720
so, um, th-thank you for your help.

39:02.721 --> 39:06.548
Oh, we-we might need
you to tell the police

39:06.549 --> 39:08.216
that Eric tried to drown Olive.

39:09.278 --> 39:11.212
Okay.

39:16.829 --> 39:19.164
I love all my children equally,

39:19.165 --> 39:21.800
but when one of them is in danger,

39:21.801 --> 39:24.670
I have to act.

39:30.410 --> 39:31.543
Oh.

39:31.544 --> 39:35.914
Um, Eric said to give you this.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.483
Pray for Eric.

39:41.072 --> 39:43.073
Pray for us.

39:54.701 --> 39:56.902
They killed him.

40:09.582 --> 40:11.616
Pray for us sinners now

40:11.617 --> 40:13.485
and at the hour of our death.

40:13.486 --> 40:14.486
Amen.

40:17.523 --> 40:20.459
Please forgive them.

40:21.527 --> 40:24.096
Please forgive Eric.

40:30.331 --> 40:36.231
_

40:54.293 --> 40:57.763
I've been in the game way
longer than you, and I manage.

40:57.764 --> 40:59.264
It's not the same.

40:59.265 --> 41:00.766
Friends are friends.

41:00.767 --> 41:01.857
It's different.

41:01.858 --> 41:03.750
- How?
- Do you really want to know?

41:03.751 --> 41:05.780
Hey, Mom, I heard at school

41:05.781 --> 41:07.383
that you have to go back into the game

41:07.384 --> 41:09.761
to say goodbye on the Spirit Board,

41:09.762 --> 41:11.787
or else it'll keep haunting us.

41:11.788 --> 41:13.922
Can we get the A.R. back to do that?

41:15.948 --> 41:18.350
I'll think about it.
