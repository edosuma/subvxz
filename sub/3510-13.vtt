00:20.421 --> 00:24.387
Ladies and gentlemen, the
moment is almost upon us.

00:24.388 --> 00:27.913
As world-renowned
trainer Francisco Pilar

00:27.914 --> 00:31.431
takes one last look
at the finalists,

00:31.489 --> 00:33.877
only one question remains.

00:33.878 --> 00:37.567
Who will be this
year's Best In Show?

00:38.417 --> 00:39.330
I'm here in the audience

00:39.331 --> 00:41.309
with Reality TV
star Kay Cappuccio

00:41.310 --> 00:43.820
and her manager and
boyfriend-- Reggie Starr.

00:43.821 --> 00:45.722
Kay, when are you and
Reggie getting married?

00:45.723 --> 00:46.936
- Oh--
- Uh--

00:46.937 --> 00:48.342
Will it happen on the show?

00:48.343 --> 00:51.989
I just wanna say hi to
all my fans out there

00:51.990 --> 00:54.264
and remind them that next month,

00:54.265 --> 00:56.471
my new scent hits stores--

00:56.472 --> 00:59.234
Kay Cappuccio's Guilty Pleasure.

00:59.235 --> 01:02.420
Make sure he's guilty
of wanting you.

01:02.421 --> 01:06.235
Francisco is ready to
reveal his decision.

01:06.236 --> 01:07.484
One.

01:07.617 --> 01:08.774
Two.

01:09.889 --> 01:10.790
Three.

01:10.791 --> 01:12.511
And there you have it, folks.

01:12.746 --> 01:16.702
This year's Sunfare
Kennel Best In Show

01:16.703 --> 01:19.281
is the one, the only...

01:19.282 --> 01:20.684
Buttons?

01:21.354 --> 01:23.937
You have a friend named
Buttons, a human friend?

01:23.938 --> 01:26.970
Her mom called her that when
she was little, and it stuck.

01:26.971 --> 01:28.145
And now so is she.

01:28.146 --> 01:31.088
Buttons and I bonded over
being rejected from Stanford,

01:31.089 --> 01:33.535
in fact, we applied to a
lot of the same schools,

01:33.536 --> 01:36.327
so we were planning to visit a few
campuses together this weekend,

01:36.328 --> 01:38.091
- make a road trip out of it.
- Ah.

01:38.434 --> 01:39.509
Okay, whoa.

01:39.510 --> 01:40.794
Where are you staying?
Who's driving?

01:40.795 --> 01:42.331
And who is chaperoning?

01:42.857 --> 01:44.170
We were going to
take your Ferrari

01:44.171 --> 01:46.984
and hook up with some boys
we met on craigslist.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.418
- Not cool.
- Honey,

01:49.419 --> 01:51.489
don't be such a killjoy.

01:51.490 --> 01:53.985
I'm sure Buttons'
mother is going along.

01:53.986 --> 01:55.876
- She is and she's very responsible.
- Uh-huh.

01:55.877 --> 01:57.744
Yeah, except when it comes
to picking nicknames.

01:57.745 --> 01:59.556
Look, if you want, I could have
Mrs. Dutton

01:59.557 --> 02:01.192
stop by to meet you
when she picks me up.

02:01.193 --> 02:02.732
Yeah, I think that'd be o--

02:03.902 --> 02:05.398
Her last name is Dutton?

02:05.847 --> 02:07.601
Your friend's name
is Buttons Dutton?

02:07.602 --> 02:09.286
That is unfortunate.

02:09.287 --> 02:10.276
What's so wrong with that?

02:10.276 --> 02:12.597
Oh, come on.
It'd be like calling me Rastle

02:12.598 --> 02:13.765
or Tassel...

02:13.766 --> 02:16.227
or No-hassle Castle. Hey.

02:16.622 --> 02:18.293
No, I was just making a point.

02:20.036 --> 02:21.659
Please don't call me that.

02:22.605 --> 02:25.628
The victim is Francisco Pilar,
judge of the dog show.

02:25.629 --> 02:27.108
We found him here in
his dressing room.

02:27.109 --> 02:29.853
He still had cash on him,
plus his wallet, phone,

02:29.854 --> 02:30.885
and a key card of some kind.

02:30.886 --> 02:32.591
Is the cause of death
what it looks like?

02:32.592 --> 02:36.639
Yep. Someone put a leash
around his neck and pulled.

02:36.789 --> 02:38.656
Do you guys have an
estimated time of death?

02:38.657 --> 02:40.650
- I put together a window--
- Excuse me?

02:40.651 --> 02:41.731
You're doing my job now?

02:41.732 --> 02:43.502
I didn't know you went
to medical school.

02:43.503 --> 02:46.387
But go ahead, Dr. Esposito.

02:47.316 --> 02:50.715
Okay. The last guy to
see Francisco alive,

02:50.716 --> 02:52.533
uh, left this room at 5:15

02:52.534 --> 02:53.858
to go get him some dinner.

02:53.859 --> 02:56.769
Then Mr. Greene found him
like this 20 minutes later.

02:56.770 --> 02:59.174
Okay. Thanks.

03:02.227 --> 03:03.883
- Hi.
- Hi. Adam Greene.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.818
I'm the Sunfare Show organizer.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.509
Mr. Greene, how well did you
know our victim--Francisco?

03:08.510 --> 03:11.580
Uh, Francisco's been our judge
for almost two decades.

03:11.581 --> 03:14.147
No one cared about
dogs more than he did.

03:14.148 --> 03:16.509
Did he have any family
that we could talk to?

03:16.510 --> 03:18.652
Royal was his family.

03:18.653 --> 03:19.955
Oh, that's a handsome pooch.

03:19.956 --> 03:22.035
Francisco loved him very much.

03:22.843 --> 03:23.986
The truth is,

03:24.054 --> 03:26.626
he got along with dogs a lot
better than their owners.

03:26.627 --> 03:27.998
So dog whisperer, check.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.104
People whisperer, not so much.

03:30.105 --> 03:32.724
Did he have any problems
with any of the owners?

03:33.005 --> 03:34.228
What are you suggesting?

03:34.229 --> 03:35.629
Just that he was killed
about a half an hour

03:35.630 --> 03:37.412
after he gave out Best In Show.

03:37.413 --> 03:40.695
I'll admit, show dog owners
can be passionate people,

03:40.696 --> 03:42.382
but not to this extent.

03:42.383 --> 03:44.465
Somebody wrapped that
leash around his neck.

03:44.466 --> 03:46.042
We'll need a list of the names

03:46.043 --> 03:48.136
of all of the contestants,
along with anyone

03:48.137 --> 03:49.924
that might have had
access to this room.

03:49.925 --> 03:50.997
Of course.

03:55.187 --> 03:56.663
Isn't this Francisco
Pilar's dog?

03:56.664 --> 03:58.162
Yes, that's Royal.

03:58.163 --> 03:59.932
We thought it best to
keep him out of the room.

03:59.933 --> 04:01.324
Why is he doing that?

04:01.325 --> 04:02.801
He was doing the same
thing by the body

04:02.802 --> 04:04.051
when we found him.

04:04.052 --> 04:06.192
Maybe some sort of
grieving process.

04:06.193 --> 04:07.658
I'll get you that list of names.

04:07.659 --> 04:08.745
Thank you.

04:09.871 --> 04:11.933
So the dog was at
the crime scene

04:11.934 --> 04:12.839
at the time of the murder.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.088
What do you want us to do,
bring him in for questioning?

04:15.089 --> 04:16.648
I'm just saying, would
man's best friend

04:16.649 --> 04:19.661
stand idly by while his
master was attacked?

04:19.873 --> 04:21.053
And if he did intervene,

04:21.055 --> 04:23.216
maybe he got DNA
or trace evidence on him

04:23.217 --> 04:24.661
that could lead to our killer.

04:24.662 --> 04:25.894
May have a lead of my own.

04:25.895 --> 04:29.568
One of the losing contestants
just filed this appeal

04:29.569 --> 04:32.621
of Francisco's decision-- a
guy named David Hernand.

04:32.622 --> 04:33.562
They said he was so angry

04:33.563 --> 04:36.232
that the vein in his forehead
was visibly throbbing.

04:36.233 --> 04:38.739
Apparently, dog shows are
this guy's whole life.

04:39.564 --> 04:41.216
Was I upset about
Francisco's death?

04:41.217 --> 04:42.405
Sure.

04:42.511 --> 04:45.282
I was more upset about his
choice for Best In Show.

04:45.309 --> 04:48.099
That ribbon belonged to my Max.

04:49.444 --> 04:51.245
Mr. Hernand, can you account
for your whereabouts

04:51.246 --> 04:53.320
between 5:15 and 5:35?

04:53.321 --> 04:54.677
Yeah, I was right here
at my grooming station

04:54.678 --> 04:58.356
filing my appeal-- oh, I
didn't kill him. Okay?

04:59.096 --> 05:00.512
Given everything he was into,

05:00.513 --> 05:02.243
I'd say, he brought
it on himself.

05:02.244 --> 05:04.702
And what exactly was he into?

05:05.674 --> 05:06.879
Well, rumor has it...

05:07.186 --> 05:08.382
he was on the take.

05:08.383 --> 05:11.487
Are you saying, he was taking
bribes to fix dog shows?

05:11.488 --> 05:13.619
Betting on dog shows--
it's a big business.

05:13.620 --> 05:16.012
And he was seen with some
pretty shady characters.

05:16.013 --> 05:17.846
People with ties to Vegas.

05:17.847 --> 05:19.474
That's a serious allegation.

05:19.475 --> 05:21.354
Do you have any proof
to back it up?

05:21.658 --> 05:22.972
You want proof?

05:23.641 --> 05:26.926
That's who Francisco
selected Best In Show.

05:27.503 --> 05:29.305
Just look at that mutt.

05:30.408 --> 05:31.574
Now back to my Max.

05:31.575 --> 05:32.867
Now the mutt.

05:34.022 --> 05:36.156
That's all the proof I need.

05:36.157 --> 05:38.580
Really? There's big money
riding on dog shows?

05:38.581 --> 05:40.243
It's actually kind of ingenious.

05:40.244 --> 05:42.052
You know, everyone's got
football, basketball,

05:42.053 --> 05:43.533
horse racing under a microscope,

05:43.534 --> 05:45.818
looking for the slightest
hint of impropriety.

05:45.819 --> 05:47.427
Who's looking at dog shows?

05:47.450 --> 05:48.716
I'm gonna have Ryan look into it

05:48.717 --> 05:50.501
along with Hernand's alibi.

05:50.502 --> 05:52.338
Whatever you're talking
about, it can wait.

05:52.339 --> 05:53.759
Ma'am, please tell
detective Beckett

05:53.760 --> 05:54.392
what you told me?

05:54.393 --> 05:56.051
I was backstage after the show

05:56.052 --> 05:59.195
when I saw a woman leave
Francisco's dressing room.

05:59.638 --> 06:00.587
Can you describe her?

06:00.588 --> 06:01.682
Even better.

06:01.683 --> 06:03.614
I took a video with my phone.

06:03.615 --> 06:05.584
She was wearing a
hood and sunglasses,

06:05.585 --> 06:07.976
but I recognized her instantly.

06:07.977 --> 06:09.644
It was Kay Cappuccio.

06:09.645 --> 06:11.616
The reality television star?

06:14.935 --> 06:15.913
Check the time stamp.

06:15.914 --> 06:18.171
Right in the middle of our
time-of-death window.

06:29.895 --> 06:31.127
Here's what I don't get--

06:31.128 --> 06:34.431
why would Kay Cappuccio want
to kill Francisco Pilar?

06:34.432 --> 06:36.394
Here's what I don't get--
how does this woman

06:36.395 --> 06:38.242
have her own perfume line,

06:38.243 --> 06:40.628
an army of paparazzi
outside of her apartment,

06:40.629 --> 06:42.783
millions of Twitter followers,

06:42.784 --> 06:44.384
dozens of magazine covers,

06:44.385 --> 06:47.108
all with no discernable
talent to account for it?

06:47.109 --> 06:49.633
Even more perplexing, why
in almost every photo

06:49.634 --> 06:51.096
is she posed like this?

06:51.998 --> 06:53.018
Oh, guys.

06:53.019 --> 06:54.813
Sorry. No time for photos.

06:54.944 --> 06:56.428
Okay, maybe just one.

06:56.429 --> 06:57.333
Smile.

06:57.544 --> 06:59.544
Hey, that's not Jason Bateman.

06:59.599 --> 07:01.192
- What?
- Oh, no. Come on!

07:02.364 --> 07:03.630
That's getting old.

07:21.779 --> 07:24.361
You two must be the, uh,
soft drink people, right?

07:24.362 --> 07:26.672
Actually, no. We are NYPD.

07:26.673 --> 07:28.588
We're here to speak
with Kay Cappuccio.

07:28.589 --> 07:29.809
Oh, my bad.

07:30.481 --> 07:31.670
Why don't you just grab a
squat right over there?

07:31.671 --> 07:32.637
Excuse me?

07:32.638 --> 07:34.716
Phoebe will bring you
a goji berry juice.

07:34.717 --> 07:37.120
You know what?
I think I have a better idea.

07:37.121 --> 07:39.452
Everybody, take five.

07:39.453 --> 07:40.397
Whoa. Hold on a second.

07:40.398 --> 07:42.488
Kay Cappuccio doesn't
have five to spare.

07:42.489 --> 07:44.337
How about 15 to 20?

07:44.973 --> 07:47.167
And that goji berry juice
sounds delightful.

07:47.168 --> 07:48.480
Sure, I knew Francisco.

07:48.481 --> 07:51.919
I hired him to do two weeks of
behavior training with my dog.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.978
Our show's gonna start
shooting again soon,

07:53.979 --> 07:56.249
and Lolita has some
minor aggression issues

07:56.250 --> 07:57.718
I wanted taken care of.

07:57.719 --> 07:59.224
This little charmer?

07:59.225 --> 08:00.830
I find it hard to believe--

08:04.720 --> 08:06.663
I assume you asked
for your money back.

08:07.368 --> 08:08.652
I never paid him.

08:08.653 --> 08:10.129
He brought her back
yesterday morning

08:10.130 --> 08:11.664
after just a few days,

08:11.665 --> 08:14.151
said he didn't want
to work with me.

08:14.771 --> 08:15.457
So are we done here?

08:15.458 --> 08:18.547
'Cause I have fittings, a
couple of endorsement meetings,

08:18.548 --> 08:20.249
like three red carpets
I have to show up at--

08:20.250 --> 08:22.630
And I've got a witness
that places you

08:22.631 --> 08:25.411
at the murder scene,
so sit down.

08:26.345 --> 08:27.577
Sure.

08:29.597 --> 08:30.857
Now why did you go
to see Francisco

08:30.858 --> 08:32.686
after the dog show last night?

08:32.989 --> 08:34.849
I wanted an
explanation as to why

08:34.850 --> 08:36.275
he wouldn't train Lolita.

08:36.275 --> 08:37.702
And what did he tell you?

08:38.426 --> 08:41.395
I would so much rather
not go into it.

08:41.429 --> 08:44.304
We've got a video of you leaving
Francisco's dressing room

08:44.305 --> 08:45.481
right around the
time of the murder.

08:45.482 --> 08:48.771
So not going into it
is not an option.

08:48.772 --> 08:49.595
Fine.

08:49.596 --> 08:50.860
We didn't talk about anything,

08:50.861 --> 08:54.508
because he was already dead.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.183
- You found the body?
- Yeah.

08:57.184 --> 08:58.324
And you didn't call 9-1-1?

08:58.325 --> 09:00.947
No, I did as soon as
I got into the limo.

09:01.725 --> 09:02.724
No harm, no foul, right?

09:02.725 --> 09:04.878
You fled a crime scene.

09:04.879 --> 09:06.219
All right.

09:06.821 --> 09:08.035
Have you heard the phrase

09:08.036 --> 09:10.278
"there's no such
thing as bad press"?

09:10.397 --> 09:12.755
Having your picture
taken with a dead guy

09:12.756 --> 09:13.931
is the exception.

09:13.932 --> 09:16.486
I have to be so careful
with my image.

09:16.487 --> 09:18.074
My image is all that I have.

09:18.075 --> 09:19.732
Yeah. No, we were just
talking about that.

09:19.733 --> 09:20.829
Ms. Cappuccio,

09:20.830 --> 09:23.202
when Francisco brought
your dog back,

09:23.203 --> 09:25.157
was he acting unusual at all?

09:25.158 --> 09:26.117
Oh, I didn't see him.

09:26.118 --> 09:28.337
He showed up in the middle of my
10:00 AM workout.

09:28.338 --> 09:30.660
I was here, so I took Lolita.

09:30.661 --> 09:32.602
But you're right.
The guy was acting weird.

09:32.603 --> 09:34.258
He kept saying, "who
is she working for?

09:34.259 --> 09:35.838
I know she's working
for somebody."

09:35.839 --> 09:37.928
He seemed really paranoid.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.681
Do you have any idea what
he was talking about?

09:39.682 --> 09:40.921
No clue.

09:40.922 --> 09:43.223
That's why I went to
go talk with him.

09:43.224 --> 09:46.704
Okay. Well, I guess,
then, we are done...

09:46.705 --> 09:47.342
for now.

09:47.343 --> 09:49.692
Just, uh, stay available
for questioning.

09:49.693 --> 09:51.332
Oh, my God.
Like I'm gonna go anywhere?

09:51.333 --> 09:53.442
I can't take one step
without a million people

09:53.443 --> 09:54.890
taking my picture.

09:59.815 --> 10:00.461
Well, it's no mystery

10:00.462 --> 10:02.814
why someone wouldn't want
to be in business with Kay.

10:02.815 --> 10:06.444
But why did Francisco think that
she was working for someone?

10:06.445 --> 10:08.362
Especially since her whole
life is about not working.

10:08.363 --> 10:10.610
And what made him so
paranoid about her?

10:10.611 --> 10:12.393
Maybe he had something to hide.
Looks like there might be

10:12.394 --> 10:14.399
some truth to those rumors
that the fix was in.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.276
Yeah, I've been going through
Francisco's financials.

10:16.277 --> 10:18.270
He made a bunch of cash deposits

10:18.271 --> 10:20.646
over the last year--
10 grand a pop.

10:20.647 --> 10:22.814
So we went back and looked at
the last few shows he judged.

10:22.815 --> 10:24.429
Our boy had a thing
for long shots.

10:24.430 --> 10:26.388
The line at Vegas on
yesterday's Sunfare winner

10:26.389 --> 10:27.637
was 50 to 1.

10:27.638 --> 10:29.269
A real underdog.

10:30.108 --> 10:31.335
Well, what doesn't
make any sense is,

10:31.336 --> 10:34.347
if he was taking the bribes,
why would they kill him?

10:34.348 --> 10:35.437
Maybe he wanted out

10:35.438 --> 10:36.690
or more money.

10:36.691 --> 10:38.333
His calendar said he had
weekly appointments

10:38.334 --> 10:40.674
with a therapist--
a Dr. Patty Barker.

10:40.675 --> 10:42.174
They had a session
the day he died.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.734
Maybe she can fill in some gaps.

10:43.735 --> 10:44.904
- Okay, let's bring her in.
- Mm-hmm.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.718
Brought you guys a
little visitor.

10:46.719 --> 10:49.656
Oh, look who it is. It's Royal.

10:49.657 --> 10:50.984
Look at you. You're adorable.

10:50.985 --> 10:51.742
Okay, adorable.

10:51.743 --> 10:53.515
We swabbed his mouth
for human DNA,

10:53.516 --> 10:54.767
but I don't have high hopes.

10:54.768 --> 10:57.368
Even if there were some,
all that slobbering--

10:57.369 --> 10:59.079
it's probably long gone.

10:59.220 --> 11:00.776
Hey, what are we
gonna do with Royal?

11:00.777 --> 11:02.993
I mean, Francisco
didn't have any family.

11:02.994 --> 11:04.967
I didn't have the heart
to call Animal Control.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.285
Jenny's friend runs a rescue.

11:06.286 --> 11:08.832
Or... we could keep him
here at the precinct.

11:08.833 --> 11:10.095
I mean, we could use a mascot.

11:10.096 --> 11:11.243
I thought that's what you were.

11:11.244 --> 11:13.128
That--what's that?

11:13.523 --> 11:14.397
What's that, buddy?

11:14.398 --> 11:15.923
Esposito's sense of
humor fell down a well

11:15.924 --> 11:18.083
and can't get out?

11:18.299 --> 11:19.956
Please.

11:21.691 --> 11:24.210
Okay, fine, but only until
we find him a suitable home.

11:24.211 --> 11:26.071
Then you better find out
what kind of food he eats,

11:26.072 --> 11:27.869
because he's not touching
the stuff I put out.

11:27.870 --> 11:28.963
Well, there's gotta
be some food for him

11:28.964 --> 11:29.939
at Francisco's place.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.716
- Who wants to make a run for it?
- To go get dog food?

11:33.000 --> 11:33.797
- Castle.
- Ryan.

11:33.828 --> 11:34.868
Esposito.

11:35.947 --> 11:39.654
Well...
shall we settle this like men?

11:39.920 --> 11:40.991
All right.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.626
Two outta three?

11:51.325 --> 11:52.438
Snip.

11:52.439 --> 11:54.964
Oh, he's been my
patient for years.

11:54.965 --> 11:58.141
I see him whenever his
travel allows for it.

11:58.142 --> 12:00.666
Dr. Barker, what kind of
issues was he dealing with?

12:00.667 --> 12:02.560
Did he ever exhibit
signs of paranoia?

12:02.561 --> 12:05.400
No. The occasional
bout of depression,

12:05.401 --> 12:07.999
which then led to
low self-esteem,

12:08.000 --> 12:09.795
which led to binge eating, uh...

12:09.796 --> 12:11.226
An eating problem?

12:11.571 --> 12:12.519
You wouldn't know
it to look at him.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.519
Oh, his diet was horrible.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.615
Oh, scraps from the garbage,

12:16.616 --> 12:19.472
dead birds, even his own feces.

12:22.072 --> 12:25.108
We're not talking about
Francisco here, are we?

12:25.109 --> 12:29.800
Oh, y-you thought I was
Francisco's therapist?

12:30.782 --> 12:32.274
H-heavens no, no.

12:32.275 --> 12:34.682
My patient is Royal.

12:36.043 --> 12:39.062
Well, I am a canine therapist.

12:39.403 --> 12:42.370
Be pretty crazy for
me to treat people.

12:42.371 --> 12:45.329
People? That would be crazy.

12:45.559 --> 12:46.995
Uh, Dr. Bark--

12:47.531 --> 12:50.535
Mrs. Barker, how did
Francisco seem to you

12:50.536 --> 12:52.186
at Royal's last appointment?

12:52.187 --> 12:54.169
Well, actually, he canceled it.

12:54.170 --> 12:54.879
Did he say why?

12:54.880 --> 12:57.084
Just that something had come up

12:57.085 --> 12:59.730
and he had to be
somewhere in a hurry.

12:59.731 --> 13:01.255
Okay, that's...

13:02.254 --> 13:04.177
actually helpful.

13:05.524 --> 13:06.845
Well... um, thank you.

13:06.846 --> 13:08.636
We'll contact you if we
need anything further.

13:08.637 --> 13:11.179
How-- how is Royal doing?

13:11.309 --> 13:13.322
Is it true that he was
at the crime scene,

13:13.323 --> 13:14.647
that he witnessed the murder?

13:14.648 --> 13:16.143
We think so, yes.

13:16.144 --> 13:18.407
There may be things he saw,

13:18.408 --> 13:21.294
things he's trying to
communicate about the crime.

13:21.295 --> 13:25.467
If you let me see him, I can
try to find out what he knows.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.851
You know, Francisco had
a lot of faith in her.

13:28.852 --> 13:30.644
Might be worth a few minutes.

13:30.818 --> 13:32.451
Of your time, sure.

13:32.452 --> 13:33.589
I'll get him.

13:34.970 --> 13:35.538
Beckett.

13:35.539 --> 13:38.803
Found enough dog food to keep
Royal fat and happy for a while.

13:38.804 --> 13:40.501
Found something
else tasty, too--

13:40.502 --> 13:41.932
electronic bug sweeper.

13:41.933 --> 13:43.504
- Looks new.
- To detect

13:43.505 --> 13:45.095
- eavesdropping devices?
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.096 --> 13:46.312
Paranoia or not,

13:46.313 --> 13:48.708
Francisco thought he was
under surveillance.

13:48.709 --> 13:51.645
Okay, so Francisco was worried
that he was being bugged.

13:51.646 --> 13:54.171
And then yesterday, somewhere
around 11:00 AM,

13:54.172 --> 13:56.767
he runs off, right around the
time that Kay's assistant

13:56.768 --> 13:58.142
said that he started
acting paranoid.

13:58.143 --> 14:00.366
Then a few hours later,
he's murdered.

14:00.652 --> 14:02.374
So then where the
hell did he go?

14:02.668 --> 14:05.902
You know, we've got Francisco's
cell phone in evidence.

14:05.903 --> 14:07.052
If the GPS was turned on,

14:07.053 --> 14:08.998
it might tell us
exactly where he went.

14:10.352 --> 14:11.926
Yes, that's right.

14:12.742 --> 14:14.092
I know. Oh.

14:14.278 --> 14:15.065
I know you are.

14:15.066 --> 14:18.754
Oh, the poor thing
is just traumatized.

14:18.755 --> 14:20.488
How was he when you found him?

14:20.489 --> 14:23.824
Uh, they said that he was
pawing at the ground.

14:23.825 --> 14:24.903
Uh, the man from Sunfare

14:24.904 --> 14:26.704
said that was a sign
of bereavement?

14:26.875 --> 14:29.226
Royal, Royal,

14:29.227 --> 14:30.637
look at what I'm doing.

14:33.313 --> 14:34.029
That's right.

14:34.030 --> 14:35.323
I-I know it is.

14:35.324 --> 14:36.872
He was trying to
tell you something,

14:36.873 --> 14:38.727
something important.

14:39.901 --> 14:41.566
Really?
You can tell all that from...

14:41.567 --> 14:44.093
Royal, look at me.

14:44.094 --> 14:47.284
I know. I know you're hurt.

14:47.285 --> 14:48.894
You're confused.

14:48.895 --> 14:51.660
You're dealing with
abandonment issues.

14:53.047 --> 14:54.965
There's a lot to
break through here.

14:54.966 --> 14:56.939
This could take some time.

14:59.248 --> 15:00.270
Tell me...

15:00.271 --> 15:04.476
did Francisco ever observe
you during your sessions?

15:04.477 --> 15:06.657
No. He waited outside. Why?

15:06.658 --> 15:07.799
No reason.

15:15.117 --> 15:16.052
According to his phone,

15:16.053 --> 15:18.332
this is the place
Francisco went yesterday

15:18.333 --> 15:19.946
before the dog show.

15:20.115 --> 15:22.839
Maybe it was to meet
his gambling contacts.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.621
Couldn't he just do
this over the phone?

15:24.622 --> 15:26.243
Not if he was being bugged.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.256
- Hey.
- Hmm?

15:31.257 --> 15:33.574
Remember what else Francisco
had in his pocket?

15:57.840 --> 15:59.078
What is this place?

15:59.962 --> 16:01.752
It looks like some
kind of a kennel.

16:02.724 --> 16:05.441
Yeah, I see the... cages.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.459
But where are the...

16:12.392 --> 16:13.556
Shepherds.

16:17.027 --> 16:18.319
Okay, listen,

16:18.749 --> 16:20.376
a friend of mine
had one of these.

16:20.819 --> 16:22.359
They smell fear.

16:22.829 --> 16:24.329
So don't flinch.

16:24.713 --> 16:27.137
Whatever you do, don't...

16:27.631 --> 16:28.770
Run!

16:38.784 --> 16:40.443
- Let's go!
- Aah!

16:41.087 --> 16:42.354
Beckett, go! Move!

16:44.039 --> 16:45.298
- Ohh!
- Come on!

16:45.656 --> 16:47.127
Okay. Okay.

16:55.096 --> 16:57.543
What the hell are you
doing in my warehouse?!

16:58.001 --> 16:59.493
Detectives Beckett

16:59.585 --> 17:01.374
and Esposito, NYPD.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.625
You got a warrant?

17:02.626 --> 17:03.789
Who are you?

17:04.531 --> 17:07.425
Jack Patterson.
I work for Francisco Pilar.

17:07.478 --> 17:09.249
Did anyway. What do you want?

17:09.250 --> 17:11.483
We're investigating his murder.

17:12.723 --> 17:14.457
What the hell is this place?

17:15.501 --> 17:18.500
Francisco was breeding a
new type of designer dog--

17:18.686 --> 17:19.923
the Pilar Retriever.

17:19.924 --> 17:22.028
I managed the operation
when he was traveling.

17:22.029 --> 17:23.720
It's a real tragedy.

17:23.721 --> 17:26.358
Guy spends his whole
life developing a dog.

17:27.058 --> 17:28.777
He was almost ready
to unveil it, too.

17:28.778 --> 17:30.369
How well did you know Francisco?

17:30.370 --> 17:31.900
Yeah, did he have
a gambling hobby,

17:31.901 --> 17:33.912
possibly took some bribes
from the wrong people?

17:33.913 --> 17:35.475
Francisco didn't have hobbies.

17:35.476 --> 17:37.221
His whole life was his work,

17:37.222 --> 17:38.688
and it was honest work.

17:38.689 --> 17:39.482
Yeah, well, the thing is,

17:39.483 --> 17:42.824
Francisco made a bunch of major
cash deposits into an account.

17:42.825 --> 17:45.629
Let me guess.
10 grand each, right?

17:46.222 --> 17:48.555
Word was leaking out about
the Pilar Retriever.

17:48.556 --> 17:50.445
People were stopping
Francisco at dog shows,

17:50.446 --> 17:53.198
giving him cash just to reserve
a pup from the first litter.

17:53.199 --> 17:55.423
Any idea why he rushed
over here yesterday?

17:55.424 --> 17:56.310
Actually, yeah.

17:56.311 --> 17:59.430
He showed up with a bug detector
and started sweeping the place.

17:59.901 --> 18:02.321
Why would anyone want to put
a kennel under surveillance?

18:02.322 --> 18:02.862
I don't know.

18:02.863 --> 18:04.602
Well, his breeding
and training methods

18:04.603 --> 18:05.902
were closely guarded secrets,

18:05.903 --> 18:08.435
and the Pilar Retriever was
making his competitors

18:08.436 --> 18:09.633
very nervous.

18:09.634 --> 18:11.143
Anyone specific?

18:12.175 --> 18:13.353
It sounded crazy at the time,

18:13.354 --> 18:16.247
but he thought one of his dog
training clients was in business

18:16.248 --> 18:18.982
with someone who was trying
to infiltrate our operation.

18:19.248 --> 18:22.149
And did he tell
you which client?

18:22.150 --> 18:23.555
Kay Cappuccio?

18:23.556 --> 18:25.446
Why would she steal
Francisco's secrets?

18:25.447 --> 18:27.758
Well, we don't know for
sure that she did.

18:27.759 --> 18:30.931
In fact, we don't know that he
was actually bugged by anyone.

18:30.932 --> 18:32.417
Well, we do now.

18:32.418 --> 18:34.341
Francisco's sweeper
has a memory,

18:34.342 --> 18:36.501
and it tripped to a listening
device yesterday morning.

18:36.502 --> 18:39.376
The same time he
confronted Kay's people

18:39.377 --> 18:40.888
and asked who she
was working for.

18:40.889 --> 18:42.092
This can't be a coincidence.

18:42.093 --> 18:43.850
It all happened on the
same day he was killed.

18:43.851 --> 18:45.786
You know, I got a feeling
that Kay Cappuccio

18:45.787 --> 18:47.537
knows a lot more than
she's letting on.

18:47.538 --> 18:49.256
We're gonna have to
talk to her again.

18:49.257 --> 18:50.624
And this time...

18:51.094 --> 18:52.600
she's coming to us.

19:06.985 --> 19:08.486
Right this way, Ms. Cappuccio.

19:10.498 --> 19:11.609
Just her.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.516
I don't really watch
reality television,

19:31.517 --> 19:33.819
Ms. Cappuccio.
Would you like to know why?

19:35.720 --> 19:37.117
You want kisses?

19:37.203 --> 19:38.465
Kisses.

19:40.657 --> 19:44.554
Because I usually find that
it's not all that real.

19:44.555 --> 19:46.513
And I don't like
things or people

19:46.514 --> 19:49.673
who present fiction as truth.

19:49.842 --> 19:52.431
In fact, I find it to
be a waste of time.

19:52.432 --> 19:55.299
Okay, is this why you
brought me down here,

19:55.348 --> 19:56.583
to insult my show?

19:56.584 --> 19:57.675
This isn't about your show.

19:57.676 --> 19:59.971
I want to know what really
happened with Francisco.

20:00.025 --> 20:01.435
This time, the truth.

20:01.436 --> 20:02.891
I told you the truth.

20:03.204 --> 20:04.645
Well, according to
your assistant,

20:04.646 --> 20:07.331
Francisco asked you who
you were working for.

20:07.332 --> 20:08.168
What does that mean?

20:08.169 --> 20:09.628
I told you, I have no idea.

20:09.629 --> 20:10.853
Really?

20:11.036 --> 20:13.212
No idea that he was
starting a breeding venture

20:13.213 --> 20:15.779
that his competitors were
just dying to know about?

20:15.780 --> 20:18.517
Tell me, does the phrase
"corporate espionage"

20:18.518 --> 20:19.484
mean anything to you?

20:19.485 --> 20:20.660
No.

20:22.940 --> 20:25.227
No, seriously.
I have no idea what it means.

20:27.765 --> 20:30.570
Could I, uh, see you
guys for a second?

20:33.388 --> 20:34.895
She set off the sweeper.

20:34.896 --> 20:35.728
What?

20:35.729 --> 20:37.400
The bug sweeper was on my desk.

20:37.401 --> 20:39.438
When she walked by, it went off.

20:39.498 --> 20:41.007
You think she's wearing a wire?

20:41.008 --> 20:42.939
Dude, look at that outfit.

20:42.940 --> 20:44.200
Where is she gonna put a wire?

20:44.201 --> 20:45.968
Well, if I had to be
creative, I'd guess--

20:45.969 --> 20:47.240
that's rhetorical.

20:47.241 --> 20:47.953
We went into the tech room

20:47.954 --> 20:50.267
to isolate the frequency that
the bug was transmitting on,

20:50.268 --> 20:52.714
and we found, uh, well...

20:52.829 --> 20:53.749
Show 'em.

20:53.750 --> 20:54.863
All right.

20:56.681 --> 20:57.465
Oh, sweet baby.

20:57.466 --> 20:59.738
Mommy's gonna get
you home so soon.

20:59.739 --> 21:00.482
Boobs?

21:00.483 --> 21:03.062
Not just any boobs, her boobs.

21:03.207 --> 21:04.653
It's on the collar.

21:05.301 --> 21:08.198
There's a camera in one of the
jewels in the dog's collar.

21:08.510 --> 21:10.054
You said she takes that dog
with her wherever she goes?

21:10.055 --> 21:11.078
Mm-hmm.

21:11.079 --> 21:12.042
Which means that Francisco

21:12.043 --> 21:14.976
probably wasn't the intended
target of the surveillance.

21:14.977 --> 21:16.521
Kay Cappuccio is.

21:26.452 --> 21:29.611
I cannot believe that someone
has been watching me.

21:29.612 --> 21:31.564
Ms. Cappuccio, when
you say that your dog

21:31.565 --> 21:32.642
goes with you everywhere--

21:32.643 --> 21:33.658
Oh, my God.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.617
He could've seen
me in the shower.

21:35.618 --> 21:38.036
He could have seen me and
Reggie in bed together.

21:39.595 --> 21:41.619
He could've seen me
without my makeup.

21:42.270 --> 21:44.210
I feel so violated.

21:44.568 --> 21:47.920
Look, the paparazzi
are aggressive,

21:47.921 --> 21:49.598
but wiring a dog collar,

21:49.599 --> 21:51.390
that's a lot of
effort to go through

21:51.391 --> 21:52.910
just to get some
celebrity video.

21:52.911 --> 21:53.512
Oh, well, I mean,

21:53.513 --> 21:55.922
it's not just any
celebrity video.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.006
I mean, TMZ's offered,
like, a million bucks

21:58.007 --> 21:59.472
for the first naked
picture of me.

21:59.473 --> 22:01.600
You ask me, that number's
on the low side.

22:02.230 --> 22:03.798
You are too sweet.

22:03.927 --> 22:04.940
Thank you.

22:05.198 --> 22:07.923
A million dollars is a
pretty powerful incentive.

22:07.924 --> 22:09.130
Yeah.

22:09.376 --> 22:10.697
When did you get that collar?

22:10.698 --> 22:12.375
Um, a few weeks ago.

22:12.376 --> 22:14.398
The camera would've had to
be installed since then,

22:14.399 --> 22:16.374
which would mean they would
need access to your dog.

22:16.375 --> 22:18.983
Lolita is barely ever
out of my sight.

22:18.984 --> 22:21.239
Only when she goes on her walk

22:21.313 --> 22:22.502
or to the groomer's.

22:22.503 --> 22:24.215
Okay, we're gonna need the
names of all of those people

22:24.216 --> 22:25.302
along with your house staff.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.618
We're gonna want to run
background checks on all of them.

22:27.619 --> 22:29.923
Meantime, we should keep
the collar-cam active.

22:29.924 --> 22:31.721
We don't want whoever's behind
this to know we're on to them.

22:31.722 --> 22:33.803
Right, which means, just go
about your regular routine.

22:33.804 --> 22:35.546
Just try to keep your
private moments...

22:35.841 --> 22:37.747
more private.

22:40.569 --> 22:42.522
Look, if Kay was
the actual target

22:42.523 --> 22:43.699
of the surveillance,

22:43.700 --> 22:46.682
what does any of this have to
do with Francisco's murder?

22:47.062 --> 22:48.299
What if...

22:48.731 --> 22:51.379
Francisco discovers
the collar is rigged,

22:51.380 --> 22:53.211
he returns the dog to Kay,
but doesn't get a chance

22:53.212 --> 22:56.095
to confront her about
it at the time,

22:56.405 --> 22:58.161
but whoever's
monitoring the feed

22:58.162 --> 22:59.515
hoping to see her naked

22:59.516 --> 23:02.883
hears Kay say that she
intends to talk to Francisco

23:02.884 --> 23:03.698
after the show?

23:03.699 --> 23:05.746
So then they killed him
to keep him quiet?

23:05.747 --> 23:07.575
Well, this is paparazzi
we're talking about.

23:07.576 --> 23:10.018
I could see one of those scum
killing for a fat paycheck.

23:10.019 --> 23:12.315
So if we find whoever
bugged that collar,

23:12.316 --> 23:14.290
then we might be able
to find our killer.

23:14.291 --> 23:16.763
Well, we could go through
recent photos of Kay,

23:16.764 --> 23:19.781
you know, from tabloids,
gossip web sites,

23:19.887 --> 23:21.577
and see if she can
identify any of them

23:21.578 --> 23:22.929
as being from the collar-cam.

23:22.930 --> 23:24.147
And then there might be a trail

23:24.148 --> 23:25.465
that leads back to
the guilty party.

23:25.466 --> 23:26.422
So we're gonna have
to find somebody

23:26.423 --> 23:28.457
- to pull all those photos--
- I'll do it.

23:29.049 --> 23:32.738
Got a little case of, uh,
puppy love there, Esposito?

23:32.913 --> 23:34.874
You do realize that she's got
a serious boyfriend, right?

23:34.875 --> 23:37.015
Who... Reggie?

23:37.846 --> 23:39.920
He was a back-up dancer
in a fitness video.

23:39.921 --> 23:40.466
I mean, I don't even know

23:40.467 --> 23:42.485
what she's doing with
that knucklehead.

23:43.281 --> 23:44.266
No.

23:45.539 --> 23:47.865
Aw. Looks like Esposito

23:47.866 --> 23:50.538
isn't the only frustrated
dog in the precinct.

23:50.539 --> 23:51.580
Who closed him up in there?

23:51.581 --> 23:52.852
Oh, he needed to take a nap,

23:52.853 --> 23:54.806
but he can't stay
there overnight.

23:54.807 --> 23:55.689
I could take him home with me.

23:55.690 --> 23:58.431
Alexis is gone for the weekend,
and I could use the company.

23:58.532 --> 24:00.888
Or... I could take him home.

24:01.631 --> 24:04.070
I mean, I've been thinking
about getting a dog.

24:04.071 --> 24:06.152
This might be a great
chance at a trial run.

24:06.859 --> 24:07.969
Oh.

24:08.401 --> 24:10.665
Yeah. All right.
Then I guess you can take him.

24:10.747 --> 24:11.737
I mean, I--

24:11.738 --> 24:13.464
I mean, I don't--I don't
want you to feel lonely.

24:13.465 --> 24:14.818
I could flip you for it.

24:14.986 --> 24:16.217
No roshambo?

24:16.304 --> 24:17.618
Well, I mean, that would put you

24:17.619 --> 24:19.529
at an unfair disadvantage.

24:19.530 --> 24:20.488
I'm pretty good--

24:20.489 --> 24:22.220
- Oh, come on, Castle. Let's go.
- All right.

24:22.221 --> 24:25.798
Just so you know, there's
strategies in this game that, uh...

24:28.439 --> 24:30.048
- Two out of three?
- Mm-hmm.

24:32.056 --> 24:32.720
Three out of five?

24:32.721 --> 24:33.843
Sure.

24:36.815 --> 24:39.231
You know, there is another way
that we can go about this.

24:51.639 --> 24:54.136
Castle, you were supposed to
be here over an hour ago.

24:54.790 --> 24:56.242
It's called "shared" custody,

24:56.243 --> 24:58.211
not "show up when
you want" custody.

24:58.212 --> 25:00.233
Yeah, I thought I had
everything together,

25:00.234 --> 25:02.883
but at the last minute, I
could not find Mr. Squeaky.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.043
So don't worry
about feeding him.

25:05.044 --> 25:06.899
I had a rib eye I
couldn't finish.

25:08.077 --> 25:09.162
You fed him a steak?

25:09.163 --> 25:10.666
Yeah. Don't worry.
We worked it off.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.240
He played, uh,
fetch in the hall,

25:12.241 --> 25:13.742
and then we watched some
"Beverly Hills Chihuahua."

25:13.743 --> 25:15.249
Boy, this guy--

25:15.258 --> 25:17.016
this guy is a snuggler.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.544
And I bet you let him sit
on your couch, didn't you?

25:19.968 --> 25:20.776
Um...

25:20.777 --> 25:22.728
No, it's okay.
You can be the fun one.

25:22.729 --> 25:23.952
I'll just be the bad guy,

25:23.953 --> 25:25.630
because there is no way
that you are shedding

25:25.631 --> 25:26.857
all over my couch.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.806
Oh, no.
He's perfectly happy right there.

25:28.807 --> 25:30.882
Oh, and he loves it when you rub
him right between the eyes.

25:30.883 --> 25:32.949
Just little circles with
your thumb, just like this.

25:32.950 --> 25:34.415
Not too hard, just...

25:45.599 --> 25:48.541
- Castle--
- Yeah, there's... you get it.

25:48.542 --> 25:50.028
Yeah. Um, all right.

25:50.029 --> 25:51.334
You guys have fun.

25:51.971 --> 25:53.436
Don't miss me too much.

25:53.637 --> 25:54.913
The dog, not you.

26:19.373 --> 26:20.642
Okay, come on.

26:20.643 --> 26:21.660
Right here.

26:22.335 --> 26:23.867
Come on. Right here.

26:23.868 --> 26:27.219
Come on. You're so cute.

26:28.710 --> 26:29.800
I never thought I
would say this,

26:29.801 --> 26:31.775
but I am so sick of looking
at myself right now.

26:31.776 --> 26:34.263
I can't even imagine
how you must feel.

26:34.264 --> 26:35.888
Don't worry about me.

26:36.209 --> 26:37.288
What about...

26:37.465 --> 26:38.279
that one?

26:38.280 --> 26:42.058
Um, that is what I
wore on Thursday.

26:42.059 --> 26:44.495
So that means Lolita was off
at the groomer's, so, no.

26:44.496 --> 26:46.383
The collar couldn't have
taken this picture.

26:46.384 --> 26:47.868
I can't believe you can identify

26:47.869 --> 26:50.020
what day of the year it is
just from what you're wearing.

26:50.021 --> 26:51.804
And people say I'm talentless.

26:51.805 --> 26:53.843
Don't listen to those haters.

26:53.865 --> 26:56.527
How many of them can say they got
their own cosmetics line, huh?

26:58.303 --> 26:59.503
How about this one?

26:59.559 --> 27:01.390
No. God. I remember that day.

27:01.391 --> 27:02.614
There was this
creep photographer

27:02.615 --> 27:04.723
hidden down between two cars.

27:07.736 --> 27:09.360
This is depressing.

27:09.439 --> 27:10.696
Don't worry.
We'll catch the guy.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.728
No, I mean, my life. It's...

27:13.280 --> 27:14.449
shopping...

27:14.913 --> 27:17.008
and partying and more shopping.

27:17.560 --> 27:20.411
And it is bad enough that people
fight to take pictures of me

27:20.412 --> 27:22.860
doing all this dumb stuff, but...

27:24.869 --> 27:27.076
do you really think
that Francisco

27:27.661 --> 27:29.660
was murdered because of it?

27:30.211 --> 27:31.444
Well, if he was,

27:31.477 --> 27:32.979
it doesn't make it your fault.

27:34.587 --> 27:36.077
Did he have a family?

27:36.389 --> 27:37.451
No.

27:37.892 --> 27:39.114
It was just him and his dog.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.932
Oh, well, I guess we
weren't so different then.

27:41.933 --> 27:42.730
What are you talking about?

27:42.731 --> 27:45.877
You, uh, well, you have...
Reggie,

27:46.236 --> 27:47.875
Phoebe, all your friends.

27:48.756 --> 27:50.109
Look at all these pictures.

27:51.291 --> 27:52.508
You're never alone.

27:55.438 --> 27:57.902
Pictures can be
really deceiving.

28:04.652 --> 28:05.686
Wait.

28:06.665 --> 28:08.336
- This one.
- This one?

28:08.337 --> 28:09.501
It's from a high angle.

28:09.502 --> 28:11.126
No, no, this is from last week.

28:11.127 --> 28:13.501
This is the day that
Lolita got off her leash,

28:13.502 --> 28:14.573
and she climbed up this hill,

28:14.574 --> 28:16.636
and this would've been
her exact vantage point.

28:16.637 --> 28:19.204
Now all I gotta do is
call "Celebrity Report,"

28:19.205 --> 28:20.734
and they oughta
lead me right to...

28:20.735 --> 28:21.663
Marcus Hiatt.

28:21.664 --> 28:23.668
All the pictures IDed
from the collar-cam

28:23.669 --> 28:24.868
can be traced back to him.

28:24.869 --> 28:27.110
He was outside Kay's place with
the rest of the paparazzi.

28:27.111 --> 28:28.801
The guy's a full-on stalkerazzi.

28:28.802 --> 28:31.819
Harassment, trespassing,
even B&E--

28:31.820 --> 28:33.253
seems like there's nothing
this guy won't do

28:33.254 --> 28:34.590
to get that big-money shot.

28:34.591 --> 28:36.070
And we know he had
opportunity for the murder

28:36.071 --> 28:38.449
because he was issued
credentials to that dog show.

28:38.462 --> 28:40.616
Wonder where he might be now.

28:57.681 --> 28:59.328
Who is your cable
service provider?

28:59.329 --> 29:01.479
Because I do not
get this channel.

29:01.614 --> 29:02.893
Come here.

29:08.321 --> 29:09.739
You recognize your work, Marcus?

29:09.740 --> 29:12.595
Kay Cappuccio did, and so did
that scandal rag you sold it to.

29:12.596 --> 29:14.128
How'd you get access to the dog?

29:14.129 --> 29:15.338
Did you pay someone off?

29:15.339 --> 29:17.296
You guys are way off
base here, all right?

29:17.297 --> 29:18.394
Look, it's not what you think.

29:18.395 --> 29:20.045
No? 'Cause I think you knew

29:20.046 --> 29:22.375
that if Francisco told
Kay about the collar,

29:22.376 --> 29:23.773
she'd go straight to the FBI.

29:23.774 --> 29:25.796
And you saw your whole world
crashing down around you.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.902
I did not kill that
Francisco guy.

29:27.903 --> 29:29.204
And I didn't even wire
that dog collar either.

29:29.205 --> 29:30.210
Marcus, we just caught you

29:30.211 --> 29:32.266
- watching the feed.
- Who's a good boy, huh?

29:32.362 --> 29:35.161
- Who's a good boy? Is Marcus a good boy?
- Look, all right...

29:35.162 --> 29:36.698
No, he's not a good boy.

29:36.699 --> 29:37.601
He's a bad boy.

29:37.602 --> 29:38.773
Her cell phone,

29:38.774 --> 29:40.897
maybe, uh, find some nude
pictures of her or something.

29:40.898 --> 29:43.477
But then outta nowhere, I
pick up that video feed--

29:43.478 --> 29:45.655
Kay Cappuccio
dropping her bathrobe

29:45.656 --> 29:47.416
and jumping in to the shower.

29:47.417 --> 29:48.806
Look, I know they say
she's got no talent,

29:48.807 --> 29:50.030
but let me tell you
something, brother,

29:50.031 --> 29:51.092
that girl's got more
talent than a--

29:51.093 --> 29:53.767
Hey! Watch your mouth.

29:53.768 --> 29:55.934
Do you actually
expect us to believe

29:55.935 --> 29:58.221
that you accidentally
came across that feed?

29:58.222 --> 29:59.790
Look, I didn't know where
it was coming from,

29:59.791 --> 30:01.277
and really, I didn't care.

30:01.278 --> 30:03.085
I was sitting on a gold mine,

30:03.197 --> 30:04.681
only I didn't have the equipment

30:04.682 --> 30:05.463
to record it at first.

30:05.464 --> 30:07.120
So I scrambled to get it set up,

30:07.121 --> 30:08.957
but later that day, they
shipped the dog off

30:08.958 --> 30:10.376
to that damn trainer.

30:11.111 --> 30:13.585
Well, that's a great
story, Marcus.

30:14.070 --> 30:15.173
Look.

30:16.401 --> 30:18.422
If you want to find
who killed him,

30:18.790 --> 30:21.350
find who he's doing
business with.

30:21.351 --> 30:23.992
And I'm not talking about his
dog training business either.

30:23.993 --> 30:25.664
Then what are you talking about?

30:27.192 --> 30:29.351
I drove back there to check
on the signal, all right?

30:29.352 --> 30:30.192
Thought maybe I could find out

30:30.193 --> 30:31.856
when the dog was
going back to Kay.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.225
The things I heard that
Francisco guy talking about?

30:35.737 --> 30:37.777
Yeah, he was into
some sketchy stuff.

30:37.778 --> 30:38.929
Really, bro?

30:39.393 --> 30:41.691
You're gonna sit here and
call someone else sketchy?

30:41.692 --> 30:43.209
Listen to what I'm
saying, all right?

30:43.210 --> 30:46.565
The guy was talking about
shipments from Argentina,

30:46.566 --> 30:49.275
getting past customs,

30:49.276 --> 30:50.742
street values.

30:53.358 --> 30:54.093
Drugs?

30:54.094 --> 30:55.051
Yeah, it seems to
fit his travel.

30:55.052 --> 30:56.548
In addition to his
international trips,

30:56.549 --> 30:59.109
made a lot of flights to
Boston, New Orleans, Seattle,

30:59.110 --> 31:00.748
Long Beach, Miami.

31:00.749 --> 31:02.388
- All port cities.
- Exactly.

31:02.389 --> 31:04.594
The international travel
to judge dog shows--

31:04.595 --> 31:05.904
that's a perfect cover.

31:05.905 --> 31:08.056
So our dog trainer
is a drug courier.

31:08.057 --> 31:10.114
No wonder he was so paranoid
about being bugged.

31:10.115 --> 31:11.458
Then that warehouse that we saw...

31:11.459 --> 31:13.383
Breeding facility, my ass.

31:13.583 --> 31:15.185
The Pilar Retriever?

31:15.299 --> 31:16.730
Pretty good story, right?

31:16.758 --> 31:18.562
Hey, I had to get you
outta there somehow.

31:18.865 --> 31:20.576
Mr. Patterson, I don't
think you understand

31:20.577 --> 31:22.580
how serious this is.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.810
We're in the process of
obtaining a warrant.

31:25.849 --> 31:28.504
We're gonna search that
warehouse from top to bottom.

31:28.505 --> 31:29.588
And we got a pretty good idea

31:29.589 --> 31:31.206
of what we're gonna
find in there.

31:31.596 --> 31:33.573
Well, I'll tell you exactly
what you'll find--

31:33.812 --> 31:35.233
suitcases with false bottoms

31:35.234 --> 31:37.035
for smuggling drugs
through customs,

31:37.058 --> 31:40.291
about 2 kilos of pure
Argentinean heroin,

31:40.609 --> 31:42.949
and the best drug-sniffing
dogs we've ever had.

31:44.995 --> 31:46.568
My name's not Jack Patterson.

31:47.386 --> 31:50.068
Kenny Weizer.
US Customs agent.

31:50.124 --> 31:51.443
You got any coffee?

31:52.962 --> 31:53.836
Um...

31:53.837 --> 31:56.867
So Francisco was training
drug-sniffing dogs?

31:56.868 --> 31:58.227
His methods were amazing.

31:58.228 --> 31:59.105
Personally handled deployment

31:59.106 --> 32:00.831
wherever we thought the
shipment was coming in.

32:00.832 --> 32:03.062
Which explains all that
travel to those port cities,

32:03.063 --> 32:05.533
and the payments,
and the secrecy.

32:05.534 --> 32:08.098
Yeah, sorry about giving you the
runaround at the warehouse,

32:08.099 --> 32:10.249
but when you're dealing
with the cartels,

32:10.250 --> 32:11.264
you can't be too careful.

32:11.265 --> 32:13.490
Oh, so that's why you gave
us Kay Cappuccio's name,

32:13.491 --> 32:15.511
because you thought
she bugged Francisco.

32:15.512 --> 32:17.503
Yeah, we couldn't really
launch an investigation

32:17.504 --> 32:19.439
without tipping our hand
to the Vasquez operation.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.638
So I figured, I'd
tell you what I know,

32:21.713 --> 32:22.663
see where you could get.

32:22.664 --> 32:24.521
Vasquez--that's out of
Argentina, right?

32:24.522 --> 32:27.098
That's a huge heroin
smuggling family.

32:27.505 --> 32:28.463
Agent Weizer,

32:28.464 --> 32:30.581
what are Francisco's
dogs trained to do

32:30.582 --> 32:32.005
when they smell drugs?

32:32.006 --> 32:33.860
They paw at the ground. Why?

32:33.861 --> 32:35.330
Because that's what
Royal was doing.

32:35.331 --> 32:36.797
So I guess that dog
therapist was right.

32:36.798 --> 32:38.114
He was trying to
tell us something.

32:38.115 --> 32:39.603
He smelled drugs on our killer.

32:39.604 --> 32:41.795
Well, that makes sense.
The Vasquez cartel had

32:41.796 --> 32:43.828
a hell of a lot to gain
from Francisco's death.

32:43.829 --> 32:46.293
His program was costing
them a fortune

32:46.294 --> 32:47.597
in intercepted shipments.

32:47.598 --> 32:50.276
Which is why they wanted
eyes and ears on Francisco.

32:50.277 --> 32:52.620
They wanted to figure out how
the customs' operation worked.

32:52.621 --> 32:54.753
But once Francisco realized
he was under surveillance,

32:54.754 --> 32:55.952
they knew he was on to them.

32:55.953 --> 32:57.946
So they got someone
to finish him off.

32:58.329 --> 32:59.443
Probably the same person

32:59.444 --> 33:01.707
who wired Kay
Cappuccio's dog collar.

33:01.755 --> 33:03.283
Whoever wired up that dog collar

33:03.284 --> 33:05.034
had to have three things.

33:05.035 --> 33:07.450
One--access to the dog.

33:07.451 --> 33:11.931
Two--knowledge that Francisco
would be training that dog.

33:11.932 --> 33:14.217
Three--some connection

33:14.804 --> 33:17.001
to the Vasquez cartel.

33:17.322 --> 33:19.461
The intersection of
these three circles

33:19.462 --> 33:21.964
holds the identity
of our killer.

33:23.864 --> 33:24.968
He's doing that thing again.

33:24.969 --> 33:27.081
Yeah, but I don't have any
heroin on me, Castle.

33:27.082 --> 33:28.934
Well, why would he react
like that unless...

33:30.309 --> 33:31.847
Beckett, are you
wearing perfume?

33:31.879 --> 33:34.662
And just for future reference,
I am partial to Fracas.

33:34.941 --> 33:36.938
Listen, don't flatter
yourself, okay?

33:37.033 --> 33:38.593
I just spritzed
some of this stuff

33:38.594 --> 33:40.649
that Kay sent over
in the gift basket.

33:40.650 --> 33:42.249
Why would he react to that?

33:43.441 --> 33:47.260
Because the main ingredient
is essence of poppy flower.

33:47.746 --> 33:49.302
And heroin is made
from morphine,

33:49.303 --> 33:51.263
which comes from
the opium poppy.

33:52.217 --> 33:53.523
Guys, what if, at
the crime scene,

33:53.524 --> 33:55.747
he was pawing not at drugs,

33:55.748 --> 33:57.590
but at the scent
of that perfume.

33:57.591 --> 33:59.483
Yeah, but this perfume
hasn't even come out yet.

33:59.484 --> 34:01.203
I mean, who would be wearing it?

34:01.294 --> 34:02.823
Only one person.

34:02.824 --> 34:04.829
- Not Kay.
- Well, she was at the crime scene.

34:04.830 --> 34:07.461
Castle, we're not talking about
paparazzi and celebrities.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.902
We're dealing with
a drug cartel.

34:08.904 --> 34:10.565
Okay, well, let's remember
what we're looking for.

34:10.567 --> 34:12.940
One--access to the dog. Check.

34:12.942 --> 34:16.235
Two--knowledge that Francisco
was training the dog. Check.

34:16.601 --> 34:18.969
Only thing we're missing is
a connection to the cartel.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.482
Uh, guys, I think I
might have our link.

34:21.579 --> 34:25.146
Kay Cappuccio shot a commercial
in Argentina six months ago.

34:26.681 --> 34:27.658
So?

34:27.659 --> 34:29.114
Argentina's a big country.

34:29.114 --> 34:31.185
It doesn't mean that she's
connected to the Vasquez family.

34:31.186 --> 34:33.018
But this does.

34:33.283 --> 34:35.618
She stayed at the compound
of Junior Vasquez,

34:35.619 --> 34:37.391
first lieutenant of the cartel.

34:38.306 --> 34:39.290
She's the one.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.237
I just wanna say hi

34:55.239 --> 34:57.036
to all my fans out there.

34:57.038 --> 34:58.403
Say hi, Lolita.

34:59.038 --> 35:01.834
And I want to remind you
guys that my new scent

35:01.896 --> 35:03.773
hits stores next month.

35:04.143 --> 35:06.833
Kay Cappuccio's
Guilty Pleasure--

35:07.251 --> 35:10.483
make sure he's guilty
of wanting you.

35:13.891 --> 35:14.733
Guilty Pleasure

35:15.121 --> 35:16.073
or just guilty?

35:16.199 --> 35:18.144
What does this video have
to do with anything?

35:18.376 --> 35:21.039
This was about 15 minutes
before you went backstage

35:21.040 --> 35:22.805
to Francisco Pilar's
dressing room.

35:22.893 --> 35:23.544
So?

35:23.689 --> 35:25.513
So we have reason to suspect

35:25.514 --> 35:27.938
that our killer was
wearing your perfume.

35:28.134 --> 35:31.138
Well, that's impossible.
It wasn't even out yet.

35:31.139 --> 35:32.593
I'm the only person that had it.

35:33.847 --> 35:35.734
Does she realize she just
incriminated herself?

35:35.864 --> 35:38.046
I said she was nice.
I didn't say anything about smart.

35:39.546 --> 35:40.871
Customs agent
Weizer's on the phone

35:40.960 --> 35:42.215
for detective Esposito.

35:42.888 --> 35:43.563
Thanks.

35:45.729 --> 35:46.569
What was that about?

35:47.320 --> 35:48.596
I asked him to call
me if he found

35:48.597 --> 35:50.149
any definitive Kay
Cappuccio connection

35:50.150 --> 35:51.298
to the Vasquez family.

35:57.019 --> 35:57.648
Hey.

35:59.002 --> 36:00.117
You know when they're
gonna be done in there?

36:00.159 --> 36:01.530
We got a reporter
from "Vanity Fair"

36:01.531 --> 36:02.533
coming by the house later.

36:03.444 --> 36:04.340
They're giving her the cover.

36:05.530 --> 36:06.288
I don't know, bro.

36:06.409 --> 36:07.870
But, um, good luck with that.

36:17.396 --> 36:18.255
Esposito.

36:18.647 --> 36:20.675
What's your relationship
with Junior Vasquez?

36:20.752 --> 36:23.213
Junior? He is such a sweetheart.

36:23.408 --> 36:25.142
Um, they have "Keeping
Up With Cappuccio"

36:25.143 --> 36:26.863
in Argentina, so he's
kind of a big fan.

36:27.281 --> 36:29.164
Do you realize that
the Vasquez family

36:29.165 --> 36:32.440
is the number one heroin
exporter in South America?

36:33.772 --> 36:34.559
What?

36:36.088 --> 36:37.892
Oh, my God.
You guys, I did not know that.

36:44.386 --> 36:45.153
Excuse me.

36:47.019 --> 36:48.178
Give me a minute, Castle.

36:51.847 --> 36:52.742
This is a nightmare.

36:53.504 --> 36:54.596
Heroin, murder--

36:54.597 --> 36:57.070
I just wish I had never
even heard of Francisco.

36:59.082 --> 36:59.795
Kay, how...

37:00.362 --> 37:01.470
how did you hear about him?

37:01.642 --> 37:02.356
Reggie.

37:03.140 --> 37:05.128
He read about him in, like,
a magazine or something.

37:05.129 --> 37:07.307
He said he was the best,
so he insisted I use him.

37:07.467 --> 37:08.205
So it was Reggie's idea

37:08.206 --> 37:10.518
that Lolita go to
Francisco for training?

37:10.519 --> 37:11.312
Yeah.

37:15.659 --> 37:18.687
Make sure he's guilty
of wanting you.

37:21.149 --> 37:22.032
Hi, baby.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.380
Are you sure about this?

37:26.457 --> 37:27.270
Positive.

37:27.366 --> 37:29.464
Customs connected Kay to the
Vasquez family all right,

37:29.749 --> 37:30.557
through Reggie.

37:30.995 --> 37:31.729
Turns out he went to school

37:31.730 --> 37:32.915
with one of the Vasquez kids.

37:33.477 --> 37:35.029
He's the connection, not Kay.

37:40.908 --> 37:41.621
Look out!

37:46.506 --> 37:47.375
Get him, Royal.

38:06.953 --> 38:08.835
So he confessed to
the whole thing.

38:09.611 --> 38:12.224
The Vasquez cartel
suspected that Francisco

38:12.225 --> 38:14.495
was training dogs for customs.

38:14.954 --> 38:17.001
And then when Kay
needed Lolita trained,

38:17.141 --> 38:18.802
Reggie steered her
towards Francisco

38:18.803 --> 38:20.167
and then wired the dog collar.

38:20.302 --> 38:23.202
But Francisco caught on,
and Reggie panicked.

38:23.452 --> 38:24.920
He felt he had to
protect the cartel.

38:24.921 --> 38:26.660
Yeah, and Reggie wanted to
get in good with the cartel.

38:26.661 --> 38:28.552
He knew that his days
of mooching off of Kay

38:28.553 --> 38:30.327
were almost over, in
spite of all the reports

38:30.328 --> 38:31.506
that the two of them
were getting married.

38:31.507 --> 38:34.263
Whoa, whoa. You mean...
the tabloids were wrong?

38:35.065 --> 38:36.136
Yeah, and, um,

38:36.510 --> 38:38.593
you know, I was wrong
about something, too.

38:39.265 --> 38:41.019
Turns out having a
mascot in the precinct

38:41.020 --> 38:42.047
can be pretty useful.

38:42.897 --> 38:44.882
So I was thinking for tonight,
maybe you take him home,

38:44.883 --> 38:46.890
and then I'll swing by,
pick him up, maybe 9:30?

38:46.891 --> 38:47.861
Oh, I don't know, Castle.

38:47.862 --> 38:49.811
I don't know if this whole
splitting time thing

38:49.812 --> 38:51.394
is good long-term solution.

38:51.664 --> 38:54.076
Well, what then, alternating
nights, uh, weekends/weekdays?

38:54.077 --> 38:56.015
I-I think it'll just
confuse the poor guy.

38:56.583 --> 38:57.918
God knows, he's had
enough therapy.

38:58.205 --> 38:59.404
I think he deserves one home.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.572
Oh, I see where this is going.

39:02.827 --> 39:04.929
Uh, no. No, no roshambo.

39:06.100 --> 39:07.061
You got a better idea?

39:07.803 --> 39:09.216
I think we should
let Royal decide.

39:09.396 --> 39:10.734
We go to opposite
ends of the room,

39:11.019 --> 39:12.925
and wherever he
goes, that's home.

39:13.381 --> 39:14.203
Let's do it.

39:16.870 --> 39:17.628
Sit, Royal.

39:17.660 --> 39:18.383
Sit down.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.723
Sit down. Good boy. Stay there.

39:20.916 --> 39:21.677
Stay there.

39:22.996 --> 39:23.658
All right.

39:25.799 --> 39:26.550
Ready?

39:26.867 --> 39:27.630
Ready.

39:29.399 --> 39:30.018
Come here, boy.

39:30.075 --> 39:31.650
- Come over here, Royal.
- Come here, Royal.

39:31.697 --> 39:32.971
Come over here, boy.
Come right here.

39:33.002 --> 39:34.952
- It's a big decision...
- Royal, who loves you?

39:34.953 --> 39:36.910
- But I know you'll make the right one.
- Come on, Royal. Come on.

39:36.911 --> 39:38.134
My couch is super comfortable.

39:38.135 --> 39:39.915
- Royal, come right over here, baby.
- Come on, buddy.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.811
- You know in your heart.
- Come over here. Come on, Royal.

39:41.966 --> 39:43.697
- Man's best friend.
- Who's here? Come over here.

39:43.698 --> 39:44.602
Man's.

39:50.219 --> 39:51.771
Looks like he's made his choice,

39:51.772 --> 39:52.670
and it's me.

39:54.925 --> 39:56.485
You have such good taste, Royal.

39:57.454 --> 39:58.239
Hi, buddy.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.788
You have every good taste.

40:00.162 --> 40:02.245
- Hi, buddy.
- Are you sure you want to take him?

40:02.268 --> 40:03.734
Yeah, maybe we should
do two out of three.

40:03.741 --> 40:04.787
Oh, yes, Lolita and I need

40:04.788 --> 40:06.172
a big strong man
around the house,

40:06.498 --> 40:08.513
especially one as loyal as this,

40:08.764 --> 40:09.526
right, bud?

40:09.693 --> 40:12.233
Royal, you are officially
a Cappuccio now.

40:12.868 --> 40:15.630
And you have been so sweet.

40:17.891 --> 40:20.458
Hey, if--you know, I know
that the paparazzi can be

40:20.516 --> 40:22.723
very vicious sometimes, so
if you ever need anything,

40:22.724 --> 40:24.018
like, I mean anything at all,

40:24.019 --> 40:25.204
you know where to find me.

40:25.665 --> 40:27.616
I just might take you
up on that one day.

40:32.204 --> 40:34.553
Well, you know what?
I mean, I'm sure it's for the best.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.410
He woulda been
lonely at my place.

40:36.411 --> 40:37.416
There's nobody to play with.

40:37.417 --> 40:38.730
Yeah, mine, too.

40:40.582 --> 40:41.984
They do look like they
enjoy each other.

40:52.284 --> 40:53.502
Hey, sweetheart.

40:53.843 --> 40:54.493
How was your trip?

40:54.813 --> 40:56.734
We had fun. Miss me?

40:57.025 --> 40:58.010
Ah, terribly.

40:58.088 --> 41:00.019
But I did manage to have
a good time without you

41:00.210 --> 41:02.866
with my new friend
Royal the dog.

41:03.913 --> 41:04.839
You got a dog?

41:04.888 --> 41:06.732
No, but I was looking
after him for a while,

41:06.733 --> 41:07.658
but it made me think.

41:08.177 --> 41:10.006
All those times when
you were little,

41:10.295 --> 41:13.333
how you begged me for a dog,
and I refused because--

41:13.334 --> 41:15.942
You said, you'd be the one who'd
wind up having to feed it,

41:16.078 --> 41:17.117
and it was hard enough

41:17.118 --> 41:18.462
remembering to
feed me every day.

41:18.693 --> 41:21.172
Yeah, I...
I don't remember that last part.

41:21.347 --> 41:22.289
It was subtext.

41:22.870 --> 41:23.736
Barely.

41:23.854 --> 41:25.603
Anyway, I want to
make it up to you.

41:26.771 --> 41:27.900
I want to get you a dog.

41:28.030 --> 41:29.857
Only question is, what
kind of dog do we get?

41:29.917 --> 41:31.977
What are we gonna name it?
Whose room is it gonna sleep--

41:31.978 --> 41:33.211
Whoa, dad, slow down.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.890
I'm leaving for college
soon, remember?

41:36.015 --> 41:37.732
You can't have a dog
in your dorm room.

41:38.157 --> 41:38.801
Right.

41:40.544 --> 41:42.032
Well, I know.
I'll just take care of him here.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.497
You can come visit him
whenever you can.

41:46.784 --> 41:49.354
So... this dog you want to get,

41:49.874 --> 41:50.809
you know, for me.

41:51.486 --> 41:53.474
This wouldn't be an enticement

41:53.475 --> 41:55.871
to come home from college
more often, would it?

41:56.509 --> 41:58.125
Don't pretend like
you're smarter than me.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.274
I taught you subtext,
young lady.

42:01.347 --> 42:02.032
Don't worry.

42:02.529 --> 42:04.184
I'll come back and
visit so much,

42:04.263 --> 42:05.249
you'll be sick of me.

42:05.994 --> 42:06.726
Promise?

42:07.056 --> 42:07.743
Yeah.

42:08.298 --> 42:10.572
Someone has to leave food out
for you once in a while.

42:11.259 --> 42:12.889
Speaking of, I'm kinda
hungry right now.

42:15.167 --> 42:16.028
Kibbles 'n bits?

42:16.616 --> 42:17.711
Peanut butter on a spoon?

42:18.738 --> 42:19.688
Chinese.

42:19.805 --> 42:20.934
I'd like a sandwich.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.302
- Welcome home.
- Yeah.
