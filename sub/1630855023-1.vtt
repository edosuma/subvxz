[Jughead] The year is 1955.

00:43.173 --> 00:46.350
Number one
on the Billboard charts
is "Rock Around The Clock,"

00:46.394 --> 00:48.048
an earworm
if I've ever heard one.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.312
Now, some random fun facts.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.792
In 1955, a hamburger
with a side of fries

00:53.836 --> 00:55.751
set you back 30 cents.

00:55.794 --> 00:59.755
A comic book, a dime.
A pulp novel, a quarter.

00:59.798 --> 01:02.062
[typewriter keys clacking]

01:02.105 --> 01:04.194
It's been two days
since Bailey's Comet
almost decimated us,

01:04.238 --> 01:07.502
and we were somehow
zapped back to the 1950s.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.678
I'm not sure
how that happened exactly.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.636
I'm not sure
if we're merely in the past,

01:11.680 --> 01:13.508
or in the past
of an alternate universe.

01:13.551 --> 01:16.771
But things are different
here in Riverdale.

01:16.815 --> 01:20.297
For starters,
I live in an abandoned
train car with Hot Dog,

01:20.341 --> 01:23.387
which actually tracks.

01:23.431 --> 01:26.347
And at Riverdale High,
we're all juniors again.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.175
Betty and Kevin
aren't merely friends,

01:28.218 --> 01:29.914
they're dating.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.962
Cheryl's twin brother is alive,
but he's not Jason.

01:33.005 --> 01:33.919
He's Julian.

01:35.225 --> 01:37.662
No sign of a Reggie yet.

01:37.706 --> 01:42.753
But Archie exists,
and he's still pretty much
a teen Charles Atlas.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.321
None of them remember our lives

01:44.365 --> 01:45.975
from before
we became teenagers again,

01:46.018 --> 01:48.108
and I haven't tried
to remind them yet.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.458
I've been waiting to reconnect
with the one person

01:50.501 --> 01:52.241
who might be able to shed light
on our predicament,

01:52.286 --> 01:54.114
because she was
both chronokinetic

01:54.157 --> 01:57.465
and the town's guardian angel,
my girlfriend, Tabitha Tate.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.380
Bus from
Mississippi's pulling in.

02:01.077 --> 02:03.340
Wonder if it was
as bad down there

02:03.384 --> 02:05.212
as they're saying
on the radio.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.823
[Jughead] I already knew
what Pop would soon find out.

02:07.866 --> 02:10.173
It was much, much worse.

02:10.217 --> 02:13.742
Tabitha, Toni
and some of Riverdale High's
other students of color

02:13.785 --> 02:15.700
were in Mississippi
for the trial

02:15.744 --> 02:18.616
of the two men who murdered
Black teenager Emmett Till,

02:18.660 --> 02:21.880
for supposedly whistling
at a white woman.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.144
The jury deliberated
for all of 67 minutes

02:24.187 --> 02:26.276
and then acquitted the killers.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.103
It was one of
the single most shameful

02:28.148 --> 02:31.281
and appalling events
of this or any era.

02:37.722 --> 02:38.767
Uh, Tabitha?

02:42.684 --> 02:44.293
Uh, they

02:44.338 --> 02:46.296
announced the verdict
on... on the radio.

02:46.340 --> 02:49.081
It made me sick in my stomach.

02:49.125 --> 02:53.781
-If you need anything...
-That's what
we're trying to figure out now,

02:53.825 --> 02:58.308
what our next move should be...
but I appreciate the offer.

03:00.571 --> 03:03.226
It's Jughead, right?

03:03.270 --> 03:04.532
Uh, yeah. Yes.

03:06.708 --> 03:07.752
I'll let you know.

03:13.105 --> 03:14.237
[Jughead] It's overwhelming.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.458
Heartbreaking.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.242
Whichever genius
said that the '50s

03:19.286 --> 03:20.896
were the greatest decade
of all time

03:20.939 --> 03:22.637

have their head examined.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.815
[Mary] Archie? Can I
speak to you for a minute?

03:34.562 --> 03:36.390
-What's wrong, Mom?
-[sighs]

03:36.433 --> 03:40.002

from James Dean's car accident.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.308
Oh, I can't even
show them to you.

You shouldn't
look at that stuff, Mom,

03:42.831 --> 03:44.659
-it upsets you.
-No, what upsets me

03:44.702 --> 03:47.792
-is the idea of you
on the road being reckless.
-Oh.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.838
And that's why I...

03:49.881 --> 03:52.144

This is the most
important piece of reporting
that I've read in my two years

05:02.302 --> 05:03.912
as editor-in-chief
at the Blue and Gold.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.784
But we've tried covering
Emmett Till before.

has vetoed the stories.

give the most incredible,
inspiring speech

05:16.098 --> 05:18.753
after the verdict
was delivered.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.276
And I got a chance
to interview people

05:20.320 --> 05:22.191
that knew Emmett personally,

05:22.234 --> 05:25.934
his friends, his neighbors.

05:25.977 --> 05:28.153
And I made them a promise
I would help
tell his story.

I agree wholeheartedly.

to our Riverdale High family.

from sunny Los Angeles.

06:11.196 --> 06:12.676

about MGM's upcoming

Though I can't confirm
that the lead role
of innocent ingenue Emily Webb

starlet, namely moi,

from Hollywood

06:59.070 --> 07:03.423

In a ghastly old mansion
Vincent Price used to own.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.327
Is that close to
where James Dean lived?

Wait, you didn't know
James Dean, did you?

08:24.329 --> 08:25.766
[Cheryl] Kevin,
don't be so provincial.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.594
James Dean was a movie star.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.987
He was friends
with Elizabeth Taylor
and Rock Hudson.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.250
Actually, Jimmy
and I were quite friendly.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.470
We went skinny-dipping
in the pool
at the Chateau Marmaduke.

-With James Dean?

Once or was it a regular thing?

08:41.912 --> 08:44.567
I suppose next you'll be saying
you and Jimmy dated.

08:44.611 --> 08:48.266
No, but he did enjoy playing
both sides of the net.

Girls and boys.

08:50.704 --> 08:55.143
Wait. Hang on!
Are you suggesting
that James Dean was--

08:55.186 --> 08:56.665
What? I mean,
he seemed like

08:56.710 --> 08:59.103
such a regular guy.
Like a cowboy, almost.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.584
How dare you besmirch
his memory like that?

Don't you be so provincial.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.849

why I'm so surprised
to hear such filthy lies

coming out of the mouth
of some wild child

surrounded by perverts

and orgies!

Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have lost my appetite.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.695

is meeting after school today.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.044
We will be bringing
something ideas to fundraise

09:27.088 --> 09:28.306
so we can purchase
new telescope

09:28.350 --> 09:29.307
before Bailey's Comet arrives.

is coming again?

09:35.444 --> 09:36.750

09:36.793 --> 09:38.273
Oh, not for
two years, Mr. Jones.

09:38.316 --> 09:39.883
But it's an extremely
expensive telescope,

09:39.927 --> 09:41.537
and this will be
the only opportunity

09:41.581 --> 09:43.713
we'll have to see
the comet in our lifetime.

09:43.757 --> 09:44.627
We mustn't miss it.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.501

can I walk you home?

09:49.545 --> 09:51.808

who walks home?

Ready, Ronnie?

09:54.942 --> 09:56.900
Thanks for the offer, Archie,

09:56.944 --> 09:58.728

I've already secured
an escort home.

Um, excuse me.

10:02.427 --> 10:04.734
And how do you expect me
to get home, dear brother?

10:04.778 --> 10:05.648
You got two feet, don't you?

10:07.041 --> 10:07.911
Use them or lose them.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.229
I'm sorry.

10:21.272 --> 10:24.624
Miss Topaz, Miss Cooper,

10:24.667 --> 10:26.887
but I gave your article
to Dr. Werthers for review,

10:26.930 --> 10:28.845
and we both agree,

10:28.889 --> 10:31.674
it's not suitable
for publication.

10:31.718 --> 10:37.767
Toni's reporting is,
it's thorough,
insightful, balanced.

10:37.811 --> 10:42.076
Be that as it may,
as a child psychologist,

10:42.119 --> 10:45.427
it's my expert opinion
that the details
of the Emmett Till case

10:45.470 --> 10:48.038
are far too violent
and disturbing

10:48.082 --> 10:50.737
for young,
impressionable minds.

10:50.780 --> 10:54.262
People, your students,
need to understand

10:54.305 --> 10:56.525
the gravity of what happens
so it doesn't happen again...

10:57.221 --> 10:58.919

10:58.962 --> 11:01.791
These sorts of things
don't happen in Riverdale.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.142
And may I remind you
that we were

11:05.186 --> 11:07.579
one of the first high schools
in the country to integrate.

11:08.755 --> 11:11.235
-Isn't that enough?
-Hardly.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.455
We don't have
any Black teachers.

11:13.498 --> 11:16.153
We don't study or learn
about Black authors.

11:16.197 --> 11:19.548
Change doesn't
happen overnight, Miss Topaz.

11:19.591 --> 11:22.769
Your article's
very well-written.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.771
Surely you can find
some satisfaction in that.

11:29.993 --> 11:33.344
Mom, Dad,
you haven't said anything.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.477
Did you read the article
my friend Toni wrote?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.089
Yes, we did, honey.

11:43.790 --> 11:44.616
And?

11:46.053 --> 11:49.534
And it was very well-written.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.536
-Extremely well-written.
-Mm-hmm.

11:51.580 --> 11:52.886
So you'll read it
on the air, Dad?

11:55.105 --> 11:59.588
Jeez, hon, we only get
15 minutes of airtime a night.

11:59.631 --> 12:05.159
Do we really need to spend
one minute on a story that...

12:05.202 --> 12:07.814
well, has nothing
to do with us?

12:07.857 --> 12:10.773
Dad, everyone watches
your nightly broadcast.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.993
Imagine the impact
it would have

12:13.036 --> 12:16.431
if you, the face of RIVW,
talked about Emmett Till.

12:16.474 --> 12:20.304
[chuckles nervously] Elizabeth,
it's not that simple, honey.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.567
I mean, you know very well
that we have to run

12:22.611 --> 12:24.134
every single one of our stories

12:24.178 --> 12:26.267
past our sponsors
for approval.

12:26.310 --> 12:29.574
And I'm sorry,
this is just not
in their bailiwick.

12:29.618 --> 12:30.880
Your sponsors,
you're talking about

12:30.924 --> 12:33.143
The Blossoms,
Blossom Maple Syrup.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.797
But if we lose their support,

12:34.841 --> 12:38.801
RIVW won't be able
to expand its programming.

12:38.845 --> 12:42.631
Hmm. You won't
be able to give yourself
a raise, you mean.

12:42.674 --> 12:46.940
Betty. Darling, why
is this so important to you?

12:46.983 --> 12:51.596
Because what
happened to Emmett Till
was a complete injustice.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.555
A crime emblematic
of everything

12:53.598 --> 12:55.862
that's wrong
with this country.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.515
And nobody
except my friend Toni

12:57.559 --> 12:59.169
and her friends
seem to care about it.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.523
[Archie] You know,
this might sound crazy, Jug.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.004
The first time that I saw her,

13:08.048 --> 13:10.702
I felt like I was hit
by a thunderbolt or something.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.227
Shazam!

13:13.270 --> 13:15.359
But how is a guy like me
going to get anywhere

13:15.403 --> 13:17.448
with a girl
like Veronica Lodge
if I'm riding a damn bicycle?

13:17.492 --> 13:19.886
[Archie grunts]

13:19.929 --> 13:22.149
That's why I'm sneaking
this baby out tonight.

13:22.192 --> 13:24.368
[Jughead] I admit,
while Archie poured
his heart out to me,

13:24.412 --> 13:26.283
I was racking my brains.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.590
If Bailey's Comet was what
sent us all to the past,

13:28.633 --> 13:30.984
Bailey's Comet might be able
to send us back to the future.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.681
But I needed help.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.422
But with my friends
unaware of their former lives,

13:34.465 --> 13:36.990
how can I make them remember?

13:37.033 --> 13:39.383
It would take
some kind of tangible proof
to jolt them awake, but what?

13:39.427 --> 13:42.299
Jug, have you seen
my dad's hammer?
I need to smack this dent out.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.953
Your dad's hammer?

13:43.997 --> 13:45.912
Did everyone bring an item?

13:45.955 --> 13:49.611
Putting in a guitar pick
and a hammer
from my dad's toolbox.

13:51.352 --> 13:52.701
[Jughead] It was a long shot.

13:52.744 --> 13:54.268
But could that
time capsule we buried

13:54.311 --> 13:56.096
graduation weekend,
possibly have survived

13:56.139 --> 13:58.881
whatever cosmic event
sent us back to 1955?

13:58.925 --> 14:01.710
The items in that capsule
might trigger their memories.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.016
Do you have a shovel
that I could borrow?

14:05.845 --> 14:06.671
[grunts]

14:08.064 --> 14:08.978
[clangs]

14:22.949 --> 14:24.037
[grunting]

14:28.345 --> 14:30.130
[gasping]

14:30.782 --> 14:31.696
Thank God!

14:52.543 --> 14:54.197
[Veronica] Well, well, well.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.938
Color me curious.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.332
The all-American boy
is secretly a hot-rodder.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.464
I was hoping I could maybe
give you a ride home today.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.250
Consider it a date.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.208
[Jughead] Archie. Veronica.

15:05.252 --> 15:06.906
I'm holding
an emergency meeting
in the music room. Hurry!

15:09.082 --> 15:10.300
Who is that person again?

15:17.960 --> 15:19.353
[Betty] What is all this junk,
Jughead?

15:19.396 --> 15:22.008
These headlines
are like Dr. Seuss.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.792
Just take a moment.
Look at what you're holding.

15:26.447 --> 15:30.059
Do you remember anything?
Do you... Do you feel anything?

15:30.103 --> 15:33.671
I mean, I like the jacket,
but I've never seen
this before in my life.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.673
I've been to
a lot of movie sets,

15:35.717 --> 15:39.590
so I know a good prop
when I see one,
and these are okay.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.941
-They're not props.
-Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.377
I don't get it.
An "inch" of what?

15:43.420 --> 15:44.682
When did you even get a chance

15:44.726 --> 15:46.554
to bury my dad's
hammer in a cooler?

15:46.597 --> 15:48.338
I didn't. You did.

15:48.382 --> 15:51.776
We all buried something
of emotional significance

15:51.820 --> 15:55.693
in that time capsule
67 years ago.

15:55.737 --> 15:58.000
-But in the future.
-The future?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.437
Yeah. Yes.

16:00.481 --> 16:01.917
This is gonna sound nuts, okay?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.353
Just hear me out.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.312
Thanks to a cataclysmic event,

16:05.355 --> 16:08.402
all of us,
we were all sent back
in time...

16:10.056 --> 16:12.493
to maybe
an alternate parallel universe.

16:16.062 --> 16:20.153
And we need to get back
to our future.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.764
Our present. I...
I was hoping that by showing

16:22.807 --> 16:25.549
you guys these objects,
it would help jog your memory.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.421
Okay. What's your object?
What did you bury?

16:27.464 --> 16:29.118
It was a yarn beanie.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.338
But for whatever reason,
it wasn't in the time capsule.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.339
Oh.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.429
All right. I'll play along.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.126
Yeah. Okay.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.476
In the future,
who's more famous?

16:39.520 --> 16:40.825
Me or Elizabeth Taylor?

16:40.869 --> 16:42.175
Never mind her.
She just got here.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.785
Bird's-eye view.
What's the future like?

16:44.742 --> 16:45.613
Um...

16:46.657 --> 16:47.963
Where do I start? Uh...

16:49.486 --> 16:50.879
Okay.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.968
We don't use
regular phones anymore.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.622
We use something
called smartphones,

16:54.665 --> 16:56.928
which we can carry around
everywhere with us.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.627
And, ironically,
we don't even
call people on them.

16:59.670 --> 17:03.109
We just send texts,
which are like messages

17:03.152 --> 17:05.241
and listen to music
on Spotify

17:05.285 --> 17:06.851
and, oh, the Internet.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.679
The Internet is like, um,

17:08.723 --> 17:10.855
having an entire encyclopedia
at your fingertips.

17:10.898 --> 17:12.161
Well, maybe tell us about us.

17:12.204 --> 17:13.815
What were we like
in the future?

17:13.858 --> 17:16.470
Okay. Archie joins the Army
and fought in a war.

17:16.512 --> 17:18.646
Betty, you were in the FBI

17:18.689 --> 17:20.909
and you were hunting down
serial killers,

17:20.952 --> 17:23.520
which I guess is a term
that doesn't exist yet.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.566
Veronica, you owned a casino.

17:25.608 --> 17:27.089
But before that, a speakeasy,

17:27.133 --> 17:29.570
which Toni bought
and turned into a biker bar.

17:29.613 --> 17:35.184
Kevin, you directed,
uh, some musicals,

17:35.228 --> 17:39.101
and were in
an organ-harvesting cult.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.798
Huh! Oh!

17:40.842 --> 17:42.887
Okay. What about me?

17:42.931 --> 17:47.457
Uh, you were possessed
by your ancestor
and... and became a witch.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.199
Oh.

17:50.243 --> 17:52.593
If that's what
we were doing in the future,

17:52.636 --> 17:54.682
why would we want to go back?
We sound miserable.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.858
Yeah, and how would
that even happen?

17:56.901 --> 17:58.294
Okay, I...
I have an idea.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.166
Now, it's a crazy one,
but it might work.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.777
So, short of waiting
for Bailey's Comet to return,

18:02.820 --> 18:06.737
the other way
that we could break through
the space-time barrier

18:06.781 --> 18:09.088
is by getting Archie and Betty

18:09.131 --> 18:13.309
to make out
on top of Archie's bed,

18:13.353 --> 18:16.269
and then we blow up
a bomb underneath them.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.358
[Betty scoffs]

18:18.401 --> 18:20.447
All right, Jug.
That's enough, man.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.144
-Let's go for a walk.
-You're not going
to beat me up, are you?

18:22.188 --> 18:23.667
Because you're really
violent in the future.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.365
What? No, we're gonna talk.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.758
-Come on.
-[Jughead] Just...
Just look at that.

18:27.802 --> 18:30.848
-You don't understand!
-No, Jug, you don't understand.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.589
We are not from the future.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.462
Jughead, it's 1955.

18:35.505 --> 18:36.941
And things are
hard enough to figure out

18:36.985 --> 18:38.900
without your crazy stories

18:38.943 --> 18:40.771
about time traveling

18:40.815 --> 18:44.558
and other universes.
And setting off bombs?

18:44.601 --> 18:47.430
I mean,
for Pete's sake, Jughead.
If you're not careful,

18:47.474 --> 18:50.346
people might start thinking
you belong in the loony bin
with the other nutjobs.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.087
You think I'm crazy?

18:52.783 --> 18:55.482
No, I, uh...

18:55.525 --> 18:58.746
I just, I think
you have an overactive
imagination, is all.

19:00.356 --> 19:01.792
And look,
you should keep writing

19:01.836 --> 19:03.054
your comic books
and your stories

19:03.098 --> 19:04.752
instead of
trying to convince us

19:04.795 --> 19:06.101
that we're trapped
in some kind of

19:06.145 --> 19:08.147
science-fiction picture show.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.410
Jug, life's good.

19:10.453 --> 19:14.109
It's not perfect,
but... but what is?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.720
Well, just trust me
on this one,
will you, bud, please?

19:16.764 --> 19:17.939
Yeah.

19:19.506 --> 19:20.811
-Yeah, no...
-Yeah?

19:22.335 --> 19:23.162
Attaboy.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.343
I feel like
all I'm doing lately

19:30.386 --> 19:32.649
is apologizing to you, Toni.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.435
But... my parents say
they wouldn't be able

19:35.478 --> 19:37.480
to get your story
past The Blossoms,

19:37.524 --> 19:40.179
and they sponsor
the nightly news, so...

19:40.222 --> 19:42.572
Well, I'm not surprised.

19:42.616 --> 19:45.140
When Emmett was murdered,
nobody wanted to talk about it

19:45.184 --> 19:47.577
and nobody
wanted to hear about it.

19:47.621 --> 19:51.538
It took Mrs. Till publishing
her son's funeral pictures

19:51.581 --> 19:54.018
for people to finally wake up.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.846
I don't think
I know about that.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.283
Before Emmett was buried,

19:57.326 --> 19:59.328
his mother asked
for an open casket

19:59.372 --> 20:01.635
so people could see
what was done to her son.

20:03.158 --> 20:07.641
How he'd been beaten,
tortured and disfigured.

20:11.079 --> 20:15.605
Toni,
do you have copies of
those pictures?

20:16.519 --> 20:18.217
At home.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.740
From when they were
in a newsletter.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.134
Are you sure
you want to see them?

20:27.748 --> 20:29.489
[French song playing faintly]

20:32.056 --> 20:34.102
[sighs]

20:34.145 --> 20:37.540
Why on God's earth
are you two in such sullen,
sulking moods?

20:37.584 --> 20:39.412
It's not like you're poor.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.675
Julian's mad
because that fake
stuck-up Veronica Lodge

20:41.718 --> 20:43.894
-ditched him for a date
with Archie Andrews.
-[Julian] Mm.

20:43.938 --> 20:46.593
Cheryl's mad
because suddenly she's not
the most beautiful,

20:46.636 --> 20:49.030
most interesting girl
at Riverdale High anymore.

20:49.073 --> 20:51.075
-As if she ever was.
-[scoffs]

20:51.119 --> 20:54.905
Anyway, these inane
movie magazines came
in the mail for you.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.385
Perhaps they'll
cheer you up.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.258
[footsteps receding]

21:01.956 --> 21:02.826
[Cheryl chuckles]

21:06.743 --> 21:07.614
[chuckles softly]

21:09.703 --> 21:11.487
♪ Well, I saw my baby walking ♪

21:12.793 --> 21:14.925
♪ With another man today... ♪

21:14.969 --> 21:17.493
-They're good, right?
-Delicious.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.756
Honestly,
I think these onion rings
might be

21:19.800 --> 21:21.367
better than the ones
at the Brown Derby.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.109
Wow.
What's the Brown Derby?

21:25.153 --> 21:28.939
It's a chain of restaurants
that Gloria Swanson's husband
started in Los Angeles.

21:30.027 --> 21:31.290
Who's Gloria Swanson?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.511
You know what?
Let's skip it.

21:35.555 --> 21:38.819
Enough Hollywood talk.
I want to hear about you.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.300
Tell me everything
there is to know about
Archie Andrews.

21:41.343 --> 21:44.172
The hot-rodder next door.
What do you do for fun?

21:44.215 --> 21:46.217
Well, I work on my car.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.784
I like sports.

21:47.828 --> 21:51.135
Um...
I come here to Pop's.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.355
And I hang out
at Sweetwater River.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.225
Yeah.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.402
To skinny dip, I hope.

21:56.445 --> 21:57.881
[both chuckle]

21:57.925 --> 21:59.753
Mostly to fish.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.798
My dad and I used
to go there together.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.713
You used to?

22:03.757 --> 22:05.715
Yeah, he's not
around anymore.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.718
He served in
the Korean War
and he didn't make it back.

22:08.762 --> 22:11.634
-Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--
-No, it's okay.

22:11.678 --> 22:12.809
It's okay.
You didn't know.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.637
[chuckles softly]

22:14.681 --> 22:16.378
Anyway, it's just
me and my mom now.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.250
And she works part-time
at the dress shop downtown.

22:19.294 --> 22:22.210
Oh. Well, I will have
to pay her a visit.

22:22.253 --> 22:23.472
I'll make sure
she gives you a discount.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.477
What about girls?

22:29.826 --> 22:31.785
I mean,
as handsome as you are,

22:31.828 --> 22:33.700
I assume you're
beating them off
with a stick.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.833
Uh...

22:36.877 --> 22:40.707
Well, I'm probably
digging myself into
a hole here, but, uh...

22:40.750 --> 22:44.101
You know,
I've never had a serious
girlfriend before.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.277
Really?

22:46.930 --> 22:48.932
Why's that?

22:48.976 --> 22:50.238
I don't know.
Maybe I just haven't
met the right girl yet.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.155
Until now.

22:59.769 --> 23:00.944
[door opens, bell chimes]

23:02.642 --> 23:04.034
J'accuse!

23:04.078 --> 23:05.079
Excuse me?

23:06.689 --> 23:08.212
Cheryl,
what is your problem?

23:08.256 --> 23:09.823
She is my problem,
Archie.

23:09.866 --> 23:12.042
Veronica Lodge is nothing
but a liar and a fraud.

23:12.086 --> 23:15.785
And I'm going
to make sure the
entire world knows it.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.613
You're not starring
in Our Town.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.137
Natalie Wood is.
It says so right there.

23:20.181 --> 23:22.096
You've been lying to us
ever since you got here.

23:22.139 --> 23:25.404
Which makes me wonder,
why are you actually
in Riverdale?

23:25.447 --> 23:27.362
Was it really
your choice or

23:27.406 --> 23:29.451
did your parents
banish you because
they were fed up

23:29.495 --> 23:32.236
with their lying liar
of a spoiled brat daughter?

23:32.280 --> 23:33.586
[all gasping]

23:39.679 --> 23:41.637
Hey, it's...
It's okay.

23:41.681 --> 23:44.118
-That's just... It's sort of
what Cheryl's like.
-[sobs]

23:44.161 --> 23:45.859
But don't worry,
no one takes
her seriously.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.600
In this case,
she's right, though.

23:49.384 --> 23:53.649
I haven't been entirely
honest with you guys.

23:53.693 --> 23:57.436
The truth is,
my parents did banish me.

23:58.393 --> 23:59.873
Why would they do that?

23:59.916 --> 24:02.963
Because I am a problem,

24:03.006 --> 24:05.792
and when problems
interfere with their lives,

24:05.835 --> 24:08.142
they make them go away.

24:08.185 --> 24:11.145
In a way, it feels like
they've been

24:11.188 --> 24:14.583
making me go away
since I was born.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.803
Ignoring me
and sidelining me

24:16.846 --> 24:21.634
since they...
started that damn
show of theirs.

24:21.677 --> 24:25.072
[sighs]
So I began acting out

24:25.115 --> 24:28.423
like some spoiled
little rich girl
to get their attention.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.644
And the straw
that finally broke
the camel's back

24:31.687 --> 24:36.257
and made my
parents ship me across
the country was...

24:37.998 --> 24:39.303
the accident.

24:39.347 --> 24:41.828
With James Dean?
You were in the car?

24:41.871 --> 24:47.181
No, I was part of a convoy
of some other good-time girls.
[chuckles]

24:47.224 --> 24:51.185
We were going
to cheer Jimmy on
at a race in Salinas.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.753
Anyway,
to keep my name
out of the papers,

24:53.796 --> 24:57.060
my parents
spirited me away

24:57.104 --> 24:59.236
and put me
on a private plane
to Riverdale.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.369
-To live with your
aunt and uncle.
-[chuckles]

25:01.412 --> 25:03.632
They don't exist,
Archie.

25:03.676 --> 25:06.766
This is
my parent's place.

25:06.809 --> 25:11.814
I can't... believe
they would do that.

25:11.858 --> 25:15.165
I mean, exile you
to live alone.

25:15.209 --> 25:17.167
Like a fairy tale princess,
I guess.

25:17.211 --> 25:19.474
[both chuckle]

25:19.518 --> 25:22.521
The show is their
real baby, Archie. Not me.

25:26.307 --> 25:27.569
[door creaking]

25:33.096 --> 25:34.010
Archie.

25:35.925 --> 25:36.796
Mom.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.146
[pants]

25:39.189 --> 25:41.844
-What are you doing up?
-Waiting for you.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.934
I went into the garage
to get a screwdriver,

25:44.978 --> 25:47.328
and I saw that you'd
taken your car out.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.896
-Mom, I can explain.
-You're grounded, Archie.

25:51.898 --> 25:55.118
Because I took
my car out without
your permission?

25:55.162 --> 25:58.034
[scoffs]
Why is that all of a sudden
a criminal offense?

25:58.078 --> 26:00.210
The pictures of
James Dean's car crash.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.213
[Mary breathing heavily]

26:03.257 --> 26:07.130
I can't lose you...
like I lost your father.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.744
[Mary breathing heavily]

26:11.787 --> 26:14.181
And I can't
get a call in the
middle of the night

26:14.224 --> 26:17.837
telling me that you
wrapped your car around
some telephone pole.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.752
Come on, Mom.
You won't.

26:19.795 --> 26:21.841
-[sighs]
-You won't.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.756
And I promise
I won't speed.

26:23.799 --> 26:26.193
I won't go drag racing.

26:26.236 --> 26:29.283
In fact, I'll ask Betty
to un-soup my car

26:29.326 --> 26:33.504
so that it doesn't
go faster than... than...

26:33.548 --> 26:35.245
-Twenty-five miles an hour.
-Fifteen.

26:35.289 --> 26:36.682
Twenty.

26:36.725 --> 26:40.033
-Deal.
-Deal.

26:40.076 --> 26:41.817
-Twenty. Sounds great.
-Yeah. Okay.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.559
[Archie chuckles, kisses]

26:48.650 --> 26:50.913
[upbeat music playing on TV]

26:50.957 --> 26:55.483
[man on TV] Oh Mija!
Starring Hiram Lodge,
Hermione Lodge

26:55.526 --> 26:57.920
and Tillie Temple
as Little Ronnie.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.313
Bitch.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.054
[phone ringing]

27:06.407 --> 27:08.148
Hello?

27:08.191 --> 27:09.540
[Hermione] Veronica?
Veronica, can you hear me?

27:09.584 --> 27:10.759
Mom?

27:10.803 --> 27:13.109
Yes. Yes, I can.
How are you?

27:13.153 --> 27:15.721
-Where are you?
-Listen, darling,
I only have a minute.

27:15.764 --> 27:19.202
But, um, what's this
I'm hearing about a boy
at the apartment?

27:19.246 --> 27:22.205
You know we didn't
send you to Riverdale to get
into more trouble, Veronica.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.599
Mom, please.
It was nothing.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.514
He's just a friend
from school.

27:26.557 --> 27:30.083
Good, good.
That's music to my ears.

27:30.126 --> 27:32.651
Mom, have you decided
on Thanksgiving yet?

27:32.694 --> 27:35.175
-I can fly back.
-Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

27:35.218 --> 27:38.613
Your Uncle Orson
just arrived. But please,
mija, fly right,

27:38.657 --> 27:41.311
no boys, and we'll see
about the holidays.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.836
Talk soon. Kisses.
[kisses]

27:43.879 --> 27:44.750
[line disconnects]

27:45.664 --> 27:47.840
[crowd laughing on TV]

27:48.579 --> 27:49.406
[sighs]

27:52.758 --> 27:54.324
[soft piano music playing]

28:05.596 --> 28:08.556
[Betty] Thank you
for letting me borrow
the newsletter, Toni.

28:12.081 --> 28:13.213
I had no idea.

28:16.172 --> 28:19.915
[Toni] The pictures
make it so much more real,
don't they?

28:19.959 --> 28:21.917
Can you imagine
the strength and courage

28:21.961 --> 28:24.354
it took Mrs. Till to let
them be published?

28:25.791 --> 28:26.879
I truly can't.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.840
But it did help me
decide that

28:31.884 --> 28:35.235
I'm going to publish
your article in the next
edition of The Blue and Gold.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.106
Consequences be damned.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.413
I may have
a different idea.

28:39.456 --> 28:40.719
Nobody wanted
to see these pictures

28:40.762 --> 28:43.112
and Featherhead
and The Blossoms

28:43.156 --> 28:46.202
don't want anybody
to read my article, fine.

28:46.246 --> 28:48.770
But what about a poem
about Emmett Till

28:48.814 --> 28:50.729
read during the
morning announcements?

28:50.772 --> 28:54.123
-But Cheryl does
the morning announcements.
-Exactly. Look,

28:54.167 --> 28:58.780
I don't know her well,
but she's going to make up
for her parents' cowardice.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.477
You want to help me
with an ambush?

29:05.352 --> 29:07.310
Hey, Jughead.

29:08.050 --> 29:10.966
Tabitha. Hi.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.534
You remember that offer
you made me before

29:13.577 --> 29:15.928
to help out in any way
that you can?

29:15.971 --> 29:18.539
Oh, yeah.
Yes, uh, of course.

29:18.582 --> 29:23.152
Well, the NAACP asked
Emmett Till's mother to travel
around the country

29:23.196 --> 29:25.894
to speak about
what happened to her son,

29:25.938 --> 29:29.419
and my folks
are joining the tour
to pitch in.

29:31.465 --> 29:35.164
I've decided that
I want to go with them.

29:36.862 --> 29:39.429
After I help Toni
with a little something.

29:39.473 --> 29:42.084
Wow.
That's incredible.

29:42.128 --> 29:44.957
-They're going to let you
drop out of school?
-No.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.960
But I got
special permission
from Featherhead.

29:48.003 --> 29:49.439
I'll have
my books with me,

29:49.483 --> 29:51.920
but I would love to have
a friend help me

29:51.964 --> 29:53.443
stay on
top of everything.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.881
Okay.
Yeah, I'll do it.

29:55.924 --> 29:58.100
[chuckles]
Thank you.

29:58.144 --> 29:59.972
I so appreciate it.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.235
-I'll be in touch, okay?
-Awesome.

30:02.278 --> 30:04.628
I mean, um, swell.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.724
Hey, Cheryl.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.857
Can we talk to you
for a second?

30:15.901 --> 30:20.775
What can I do for you...
Toni, is it? And Betty.

30:20.819 --> 30:24.866
Your family controls our RIVW,
which means they control

30:24.910 --> 30:27.042
what Riverdale watches,

30:27.086 --> 30:29.175
and Principal Featherhead

30:29.218 --> 30:31.133
decides what I can
and cannot publish in
the Blue and Gold.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.396
The powers that be have
silenced my article

30:33.440 --> 30:37.661
on Emmett Till's murder trial,
but you can fix this.

30:37.705 --> 30:40.708
During the
morning announcements.

30:40.751 --> 30:43.711
As junior class president,
I can't read an article

30:43.754 --> 30:45.626
that Principal Featherhead
has already rejected.

30:45.669 --> 30:48.324
Not an article.
Something else.

30:48.368 --> 30:50.239
He'd pull the plug.
He's done it before.

30:50.283 --> 30:52.459
We'll take care
of Featherhead.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.896
All you have to do is
let us borrow your soapbox
for a few minutes.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.205
What would I be reading?

31:06.516 --> 31:08.170
Good morning, Miss Bell.

31:08.214 --> 31:10.042
Are you ready
for the morning
announcements?

31:10.085 --> 31:12.305
Apparently,
one of your classmates,
Tabatha Tate,

31:12.348 --> 31:14.176
has passed out
on the football field.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.613
Principal Featherhead
is tending to her now.

31:16.657 --> 31:19.442
I'm to bring
both him and her
some smelling salts.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.140
Ugh, you don't say.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.793
You know how
to use a microphone,
don't you?

31:22.837 --> 31:24.360
-Indeed, I do.
-[sighs in relief]

31:24.404 --> 31:26.101
-Don't worry, Miss Bell.
All will be well.
-[sighs]

31:26.928 --> 31:27.842
Toodles.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.372
[microphone feedback]

31:36.416 --> 31:38.461
[Cheryl over PA]
Good morning, Riverdaleans.

31:38.505 --> 31:42.465
In lieu of our usual
morning announcements,
I, Cheryl Blossom,

31:42.509 --> 31:44.424
will be turning over
my microphone

31:44.467 --> 31:47.775
to one of our classmates,
Toni Topaz.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.473
Please give her
your undivided attention.

31:50.517 --> 31:51.300
[microphone feedback]

31:54.738 --> 31:58.873
Some of you may
have heard what's happening
in Mississippi right now.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.745
How a 14-year-old boy,
Emmett Till,

32:01.789 --> 32:05.314
was murdered
for maybe whistling
at a white woman

32:05.358 --> 32:07.838
and how his killers
were just acquitted.

32:07.882 --> 32:10.189
I wrote an article
about the trial,

32:10.232 --> 32:14.541
and nobody wants you
to read it because
it is "too upsetting."

32:14.584 --> 32:18.414
So, instead, I'm going
to read you a poem that
the great American writer

32:18.458 --> 32:22.201
Langston Hughes wrote
about Emmett Till.

32:22.244 --> 32:25.073
It's titled
Mississippi-1955.

32:25.117 --> 32:31.645
And I hope
you hear his words
and reflect on them

32:31.688 --> 32:33.386
and talk to each
other about them.

32:38.869 --> 32:41.829
"Oh, what sorrow!
oh, what pity!

32:42.612 --> 32:44.614
Oh, what pain!

32:44.658 --> 32:48.096
That tears and blood
Should mix like rain

32:48.140 --> 32:50.403
And terror come again
To Mississippi.

32:51.317 --> 32:52.971
Come again?

32:53.014 --> 32:54.276
Where has terror been?

32:55.321 --> 32:58.063
On vacation?
Up North?

32:58.106 --> 33:01.022
In some other section
Of the nation,

33:01.066 --> 33:04.199
Lying low, unpublicized?

33:04.243 --> 33:06.723
Masked-with only
Jaundiced eyes

33:06.767 --> 33:08.334
Showing through the mask?

33:09.988 --> 33:13.643
Oh, what sorrow,
Pity, pain,

33:13.687 --> 33:17.038
That tears and blood
Should mix like rain

33:17.082 --> 33:18.997
In Mississippi!

33:19.040 --> 33:21.521
And terror, fetid hot,

33:21.564 --> 33:24.176
Yet clammy cold remain."

33:25.438 --> 33:26.743
[students murmuring]

33:29.355 --> 33:31.444
[Jughead] I don't think
any of the students
at Riverdale High

33:31.487 --> 33:34.099
had ever heard
a poem like that.

33:34.142 --> 33:38.016
Hopefully, it was worth
whatever blowback the girls
were certain to get.

33:38.059 --> 33:42.281
The lies,
the insubordination,
the trickery.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.718
I did feel sick.

33:44.761 --> 33:47.242
Then I felt better.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.505
Surely you aren't
saying that we can't
read poems

33:49.549 --> 33:51.420

A poem written
by one of our greatest
living authors.

33:53.683 --> 33:57.557
All poems read during
morning announcements
must be approved by me.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.472
This is the first
I've heard of
any such rule,

33:59.515 --> 34:01.778
but I assure you,
moving forward,

34:01.822 --> 34:04.129
all poems will
be submitted for
your approval.

34:04.172 --> 34:05.434
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

34:08.742 --> 34:13.051
I'm not sure what
you ladies think you've
accomplished.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.965
[Jughead]
But something
had been accomplished.

34:15.009 --> 34:18.969
Given recent events,
it might be fruitful
for us to discuss

34:19.013 --> 34:22.277
the poem
Langston Hughes wrote
about Emmett Till.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.371
How did it make you feel?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.031
Angry.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.424
[indistinct whispering]

34:40.426 --> 34:41.514
Upset.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.081
Hopeless.

34:46.344 --> 34:48.347
Was he really just
14 years old?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.350
He was.

34:51.393 --> 34:54.918
He was younger than
all of us in this room.

34:54.962 --> 34:57.269
Taken out of his home
in the middle of the night,

34:58.531 --> 35:01.621
beaten, tortured.

35:01.664 --> 35:04.145
His body thrown
into the river.

35:04.189 --> 35:05.320
[student whispering]
That's just wrong.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.629
Miss Topaz,
Miss Tate, Mr. Walker,

35:09.672 --> 35:12.806
I understand that
you were in Mississippi
for the trial.

35:12.849 --> 35:16.026
If you're comfortable
sharing your experience,

35:16.070 --> 35:19.247
I believe it would be
valuable for the rest of us

35:19.291 --> 35:21.815
to hear about
what you saw.

35:21.858 --> 35:22.946
Miss Topaz.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.253
Would you like to start?

35:30.998 --> 35:33.914
[Jughead] Fitfully,
but also necessarily,

35:33.957 --> 35:37.091
a conversation that
might not have happened
for decades

36:33.495 --> 36:36.150
Maybe 1955
wasn't the dream.
Maybe... Maybe the future,

36:36.194 --> 36:37.586
maybe that was the dream,

36:37.630 --> 36:39.109

36:40.372 --> 36:42.069
Hi, stranger.

36:42.112 --> 36:43.288
Mind if I join you?

36:44.463 --> 36:45.899
Yeah.

36:45.942 --> 36:47.117
I thought...
I thought you were leaving.

I'm not the Tabitha

But I can't
take us home.

Not yet.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.677
Why? Well, why not?

37:24.720 --> 37:27.636
Our last-minute gambit
to stop Bailey's Comet

37:27.680 --> 37:30.596
from destroying Riverdale
didn't work.

37:31.771 --> 37:34.252
So the comet hit?

37:34.295 --> 37:37.211
And it triggered
an extinction level event.

37:39.953 --> 37:42.303
Are... Are we all dead?

-The sweet hereafter?
-No, we are alive.

37:48.483 --> 37:52.313
In the past,
I had a plan B.

37:52.357 --> 37:56.012
At the moment of impact,
I used what was left
of my life-force

37:56.056 --> 37:58.363
to send everyone back
to the past

37:58.406 --> 38:01.235
to a point far enough
back that might give us
the necessary runway

38:01.279 --> 38:03.150
to make it back
to the present,
a present in which

38:03.193 --> 38:05.718
Riverdale isn't destroyed.
by Bailey's Comet.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.720
Is that even possible?

38:07.763 --> 38:08.938
Hopefully.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.855
But if it is,
I have to do it alone.

38:12.899 --> 38:15.423
By exploring and untangling
the various timelines

38:15.467 --> 38:18.208
that became
knotted and entwined
when the comet struck.

38:18.252 --> 38:21.342
Well, what about
the rest of us?

38:21.386 --> 38:24.214
You all have
to make a go of it
here in the '50s

38:24.258 --> 38:25.955
by doing what
you can to ensure,

38:25.999 --> 38:28.523
to paraphrase
one of my heroes,

38:28.567 --> 38:33.049
that the moral arc
of this universe bends
towards justice.

38:33.093 --> 38:36.401
That way,
when I finally do untangle
the various timelines,

38:36.444 --> 38:38.968
we can make it
back to a Riverdale that

38:39.012 --> 38:42.276
isn't on the verge
of moral and societal
collapse.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.324
But fair warning.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.978
Given the near
infinite number of timelines
and universes,

38:49.022 --> 38:53.461
it could take a while,
so you better get
comfortable.

38:54.027 --> 38:55.507
Oh.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.030
I mean, how...
How can I?

38:57.073 --> 38:59.598
I remember everything
about our old lives?

an anomaly,

39:12.001 --> 39:14.613

that I'm here to fix

39:14.656 --> 39:17.180
by making you forget.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.531
Otherwise,
your knowledge could
drive you insane,

39:19.574 --> 39:22.882
or it could drive you
to do something that further
corrupts this timeline.

39:27.147 --> 39:28.844
Will I...
I'll forget everything?

39:30.063 --> 39:32.108
Yes.

39:32.152 --> 39:35.634
You'd be just like
everyone else,
able to live in the present.

39:36.678 --> 39:37.723
In the moment.

39:41.596 --> 39:44.860
I don't...
I mean, I don't want to forget
about you or about us.

39:45.774 --> 39:46.732
I know.

39:48.342 --> 39:49.430

[Jughead] In those
first few seconds after
Angel Tabitha disappeared,

40:53.189 --> 40:55.931
I could feel
the effects of her kiss
taking hold.

40:55.975 --> 40:58.238
But for the moment,
I still remembered.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.370
I needed to write down
everything, our stories,

41:00.414 --> 41:02.198
our lives,
before it was too late.

41:05.724 --> 41:06.986

But then,
like mist evaporating
in the sun,

41:17.213 --> 41:18.867
it was all gone.

41:18.911 --> 41:21.130

to get down three words.

41:21.174 --> 41:23.829
Bend. Towards. Justice.

41:23.872 --> 41:25.918
Meaning what, exactly?

41:25.961 --> 41:28.007
And that wasn't even
the weirdest thing.

41:28.050 --> 41:30.226
That would be the sudden,
inexplicable appearance

41:30.270 --> 41:32.968
of something I've never
seen before.
