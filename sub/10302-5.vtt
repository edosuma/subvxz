02:06.600 --> 02:10.229
Al, why you watching TV
with the sound off?

02:10.720 --> 02:12.073
It's the new rap channel, Peg.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.278
I hate this when I hear it on the radio,
but now that I see it...

02:15.480 --> 02:17.994
...I can appreciate
its profound statement.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.918
Well, what's that one called?

02:23.160 --> 02:25.310
It's called "Pump That Rump."

02:29.120 --> 02:30.758
I'm really into it.

02:31.720 --> 02:36.350
Well, if history teaches us anything,
you'll be out of it in seven seconds.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.634
Oh, God, what a day.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.956
I made an appearance as the
Verminator at this elementary school.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.270
They make me walk
through this metal detector.

02:51.480 --> 02:55.029
I've got enough poison strapped to
my back to dust an entire rain forest...

02:55.240 --> 02:58.232
...and they wanna know why
I'm carrying a toenail clipper.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.948
Then there's the pat-down.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.997
First by the principal...

03:02.240 --> 03:04.390
...then by the school nurse...

03:04.600 --> 03:07.797
...then again by the principal
while the school nurse watched.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.596
Finally, I make it into the classroom.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.394
After talking the substitute teacher
in from the ledge...

03:13.600 --> 03:17.513
...I go to the cafeteria where I taught
the kids how to kill roaches, rats...

03:17.720 --> 03:20.473
...and something they call
"sloppy joes."

03:20.720 --> 03:23.109
You know, it is a wonder
I got out of there unscathed.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.679
I'm telling you, that is the last time
I appear at a Catholic school.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.438
Peggy.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.718
Guess what happened
at the bank today.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.793
A hold-up man
gave you his mask to wear?

03:52.680 --> 03:55.638
Turn that disgusting thing off.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.031
Here, watch this. Steel Magnolias.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.272
What's Boris Karloff
doing in a dress?

04:03.320 --> 04:06.039
That's Shirley MacLaine,
you baco-bit.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.874
Well, I owe Boris an apology.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.190
You owe everything an apology.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.477
Anyway, Peggy,
those wormless weasels at the bank...

04:14.720 --> 04:17.632
...want me to be the speaker
at the next shareholders' meeting.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.552
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?

04:19.800 --> 04:22.439
No. Not when you have to tell them
the bank's in trouble.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.994
How much trouble?

04:24.800 --> 04:27.553
We backed Last Action Hero.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.395
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.474
And to cut costs, we may even have
to lay off some employees.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.711
Marcie, as someone
who's been to your bank...

04:38.960 --> 04:41.520
...I certainly hope you keep
those 75 vice presidents...

04:41.760 --> 04:44.638
...and lay off those pesky two tellers.

04:45.080 --> 04:49.039
You know, the ones who work
a cool half hour apiece on payday.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.110
You know, Al, you can avoid
the wait to cash your paycheque...

04:53.360 --> 04:58.070
...because the hot dog vendor outside
always has a coin dispenser.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.312
Marcie, why are you here?

05:06.520 --> 05:08.511
I wanted to talk to Peggy privately.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.149
No, no. Why here on Earth?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.113
I'll handle this, Marcie.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.396
You come in here to my house
and annoy me...

05:21.640 --> 05:25.633
...with your sad little hen...
There it is.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.320
There's no sound.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.839
No sound to us humans.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.271
Come on, Marcie.

05:39.520 --> 05:43.718
So tell me what's wrong with speaking
to the shareholders of the bank.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.076
Well, I'm terrified
of speaking in public.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.393
It all started
with a terrible childhood incident.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.759
This isn't your
Uncle No-Pocket story, is it?

05:53.480 --> 05:54.708
No.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.514
This was in the first grade
when I had to give a talk...

05:57.760 --> 06:00.035
...on why I love
the Pledge of Allegiance.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.670
Well, anyway, I was right
in the middle of my speech...

06:04.200 --> 06:07.476
...when I looked down and saw
the biggest, ugliest cockroach...

06:07.720 --> 06:12.111
...which ever spewed from the bowels
of the Earth, crawling up my little leg.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.637
Well, I screamed
like a lunch whistle...

06:14.880 --> 06:17.110
...and ran around the room
tearing off my dress...

06:17.360 --> 06:21.194
...revealing my " Hey, hey, we're the
Monkees" panties to the entire room.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.590
Well, it may not surprise you...

06:26.840 --> 06:30.549
...that boys can be extremely cruel
at times like this.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.190
They spent the rest of the school year
following me around saying:

06:34.400 --> 06:36.789
"Can Davy come out and play?"

06:38.880 --> 06:42.395
But one night I showed them.
I showed them all.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.393
There was a class field trip
to Mount Rushmore.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.950
I told them I was too sick to make it.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.237
The bus was barrelling down
a rain-slicked highway.

06:52.480 --> 06:56.917
It would have been hard to stop even
if the bus had functioning brakes...

06:58.400 --> 07:03.269
...but they never laughed at me
or my panties ever again.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.395
Well, that was a lovely story.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.791
I don't think you'll be needing
any more of this.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.835
Marcie, I know who could help you
with your public-speaking problem.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.399
It's Dr. Angela.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.234
She is the best radio psychiatrist
in the city.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.870
And has quite an informative
car-repair show too.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.680
She's helped me
with some of my problems.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.993
Although, obviously not all of them.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.109
Yo, video channel?

07:45.640 --> 07:48.029
Yeah, do you take requests?

07:49.320 --> 07:51.231
I'd like "Rump Shaker"...

07:51.480 --> 07:56.076
..."Gangster Booty"
and "Put More Ass on That Lass."

08:01.080 --> 08:02.308
My age?

08:02.880 --> 08:05.110
I'm 15.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.190
I need parental permission?
Just a minute, please.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.271
Tell him it's okay.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.433
It's okay.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.716
He's over 40.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.673
Why'd you tell him my real age?

08:21.920 --> 08:23.478
They already knew your real age.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.915
They wanted to know your IQ.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.713
But they will play them, right?

08:29.120 --> 08:31.395
Oh, wipe your chin.

08:32.919 --> 08:37.232
Peggy, I just got off the phone
with Dr. Angela. She was a great help.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.313
Pig. Here. Watch this.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.789
Fried Green Tomatoes.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.756
Well, what's Mel TormÃ©
doing in a dress?

08:47.520 --> 08:50.637
That's Kathy Bates, you potted plant.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.440
Anyway, Peggy, Dr. Angela is a gem.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.275
I told her about my fear
of speaking in public...

08:56.520 --> 08:59.273
...so she asked is there any time
I'm not afraid of speaking.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.115
And I said, "Why, yes.
During sex I talk, yell, scream..."

09:03.360 --> 09:05.749
Hey, excuse me!

09:08.040 --> 09:11.510
You know, I'm planning
on having dinner later.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.634
Well, I plan on having sex later...

09:21.880 --> 09:25.236
...so I guess we'll both
be cooking for ourselves.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.996
Go on, Marcie. You were screaming?

09:30.240 --> 09:34.791
Oh, yes. So Dr. Angela suggested that
I try something called transference.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.429
Whenever I'm gonna have to speak
in a scary setting...

09:37.680 --> 09:39.636
...I just pretend
I'm in a more relaxed one.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.997
Like my bedroom.
And presto, I can speak in public.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.159
Dr. Angela just told me
I should take a lover.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.834
But I'm afraid we'd wake Al.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.673
Anyway, since you're the one
that helped me through this...

09:53.880 --> 09:57.156
...it would mean a lot if you would
come and hear me speak Saturday.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.994
- Oh, I'd be delighted.
- Thanks.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.673
Now, see?

10:02.920 --> 10:05.480
I told you you'd like this movie.

10:05.720 --> 10:09.269
I'm glad to see
you're finally growing up.

10:10.160 --> 10:13.596
You know, Peg, that Kathy Bates
has a mighty fine butt.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.678
Why does she waste her time
making movies?

10:24.680 --> 10:29.515
So we still say, don't give up
on Last Action Hero just yet.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.673
It still hasn't been released
in Albania or Zimbabwe.

10:34.720 --> 10:38.190
Everything else, however,
seems to be fine.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.795
Wonderful. Never better.

10:41.040 --> 10:45.431
And now, delivering the emergency
state-of-the-bank address...

10:45.680 --> 10:48.717
...vice president in charge
of something or other...

10:48.920 --> 10:50.911
...Miss Marcie D'Arcy.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.074
Good afternoon.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.277
My, there are a lot of you
out there today.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.715
The last time I saw
this many people in a bank...

11:06.960 --> 11:09.872
...I closed my window
and went to lunch.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.556
All kidding aside...

11:17.800 --> 11:20.997
...l'm here to report some bad news.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.277
Because of some
unfortunate investments...

11:24.520 --> 11:28.229
...the bank is being forced
to downsize.

11:39.080 --> 11:43.870
But the good news is
all indications suggest...

11:44.120 --> 11:49.797
...that the terrible economy is going
to get bedroom... Butter. Better.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.077
As you can see...

11:55.400 --> 11:59.439
...when the Federal Reserve Board
eases restrictions...

11:59.680 --> 12:05.994
...interest rates fall,
but when it tightens...

12:08.680 --> 12:12.593
...interest rates rise.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.556
Oh, my God.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.916
Al, something's wrong.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.832
I've never seen Marcie act like this.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.838
You wanna see acting, Peg,
check this out.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.239
For years, the Fed held back...

12:36.480 --> 12:42.191
...and interest rates rose
and rose and rose.

12:42.440 --> 12:46.877
Eight percent, 10 percent,
17 percent...

12:47.120 --> 12:49.475
...up and up.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.471
Jefferson, have you ever seen Marcie
do this before?

12:53.680 --> 12:55.557
Not in public.

13:00.160 --> 13:03.152
Unless you count
the Skyway at Disneyland.

13:03.400 --> 13:07.234
- You mean that she's about to have...
- Big time.

13:08.520 --> 13:12.115
It must be that transference thing
that Dr. Angela told her about.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.352
I just hope she's near
the end of her speech.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.790
I guess not.

13:19.680 --> 13:24.037
Then when the rates rose as high
as they possibly could...

13:24.280 --> 13:27.078
...and the economy
could take no more...

13:27.320 --> 13:30.949
...suddenly the Fed began
pumping in money faster and faster.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.400
- Here we go.
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

13:41.640 --> 13:46.634
Oh, Jefferson! Oh, Steve!
Oh, Jamal.

14:04.280 --> 14:09.354
I hope this news was as good for you
as it was for me. Good day.

14:18.440 --> 14:22.149
So that's what one looks like.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.518
Oh, Marcie, relax.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.029
It happened.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.394
It could have happened to anyone.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.757
Well, it couldn't have happened
to me.

14:46.120 --> 14:51.194
Well, it could, but we can't afford
the pony rides anymore.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.993
Don't you understand my pain?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.592
I'm a businesswoman.

14:58.840 --> 15:03.038
We're not allowed to go flopping
around on the floor like a mudskipper.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.916
At the very least,
it's considered unprofessional.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.232
You know, this is gonna
cost me my job. I'm ruined.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.270
- Marcie, the bank just called.
- Oh, I knew it.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.838
You're getting a raise.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.116
And they're gonna loan you out...

15:22.320 --> 15:25.915
...to deliver bad news
to other corporations.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.275
At $5000 a pop.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.279
So to speak.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.673
Well, I don't know.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.717
This goes against my principles.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.518
What do you think, Peggy?

15:45.760 --> 15:49.275
Marcie, for five grand,
not only would I do it...

15:49.480 --> 15:53.029
...but I'd do it in the corn fields
on Hee Haw.

16:29.640 --> 16:33.269
Al, Marcie's making
another appearance today...

16:33.520 --> 16:36.876
...so, what do you say
we have a candlelight dinner...

16:37.120 --> 16:39.315
...and take in a speech?

16:41.640 --> 16:44.313
It doesn't work anymore, Peg.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.197
What doesn't work?

16:49.080 --> 16:50.399
lt.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.468
Well, how can you tell?

16:53.720 --> 16:58.430
I've been reading Playboy, Big 'Uns,
Little 'Uns, In Between 'Uns, nothing.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.357
Then I remembered it hasn't worked
since the afternoon...

17:02.560 --> 17:06.633
...I saw Marcie do that horrible thing
at the bank meeting.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.270
Marcie killed it, Peg.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.397
You made it sick, but Marcie killed it.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.878
Well, I guess then
we can just put it behind us...

17:29.120 --> 17:30.917
...and get on
with the rest of our lives.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.549
Well, Peg, what will you do?

17:33.800 --> 17:35.438
Well, I'll be okay.

17:35.680 --> 17:41.038
I'll just keep going,
and going, and going.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.548
Great news, Dad.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.519
- Tuition is going up at school.
- How much?

17:55.080 --> 17:57.230
Hundreds. Thousands. Who cares?

17:57.520 --> 18:02.640
The point is, Mrs. D'Arcy
is gonna give us the news. Oh, man.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.839
Now, son, you're talking about this
like it's a good thing.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.559
Remember when you were younger...

18:10.800 --> 18:15.590
...and I told you never to stare directly
at the sun or Grandma and you did?

18:16.600 --> 18:21.071
Well, this is like
staring at Grandma in the sun.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.712
Or your father in the shower.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.832
If we're speaking hypothetically.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.630
Peg, I'm trying to have a talk
with my son.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.348
Isn't Oprah doing a show
on women with chafed thighs...

18:32.560 --> 18:34.869
...who cause forest fires this week?

18:38.560 --> 18:41.279
No. You made that up.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.112
Didn't you?

18:45.680 --> 18:46.908
I know you did.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.151
Well, I'm gonna go check
the Oprah hotline.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.679
Son.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.355
Now, I realize that my advice to you
in the past...

18:57.600 --> 19:00.512
...has been, well, a little shaky.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.316
You mean like " Be yourself,
people will like you"?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.392
Exactly. But son...

19:07.640 --> 19:10.871
...you do not wish to see this woman
in the throes of passion.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.633
Please believe me.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.155
It's killed before.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.594
It will kill again.

19:19.680 --> 19:23.434
Sorry, Dad, but I got a pack of condoms
and a girl who thinks Urkle's sexy.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.432
I'm going.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.158
Bud, got a question for you.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.550
I don't know what to wear
to my speech tonight.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.156
I need something hip, cool, collegiate.
What do you suggest?

19:37.600 --> 19:40.512
Well, it depends.
Now, are you gonna be backlit?

19:40.760 --> 19:43.718
Can no one hear my cries?

19:45.640 --> 19:47.437
Okay, Marcie.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.955
I'm ready to go to the college.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.154
- Honey, are you okay?
- No. I'm not okay.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.472
Look, Marcie, I'm a man.
I have needs.

19:56.720 --> 20:00.190
I am tired of everyone else
having sex but me.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.719
And Al and Peggy.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.479
And probably Bud.

20:10.120 --> 20:13.192
Listen, Jefferson, if you're going to talk
about personal matters...

20:13.440 --> 20:15.351
...then let's go someplace private.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.788
Now, what's bothering you?

20:22.040 --> 20:24.952
You've been having
such a good time on stage.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.077
You've forgotten about us.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.629
Oh, Sugar Tush.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.474
I always think about you
when I'm up there.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.792
But it's not the same.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.632
Marcie...

20:37.880 --> 20:40.917
...I miss our rodeo nights.

20:42.560 --> 20:47.270
The nights when you come out in
your teddies and your batting gloves.

20:49.240 --> 20:53.472
I have been neglecting
my little Fluff Bunny.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.032
Look, Marcie,
your speeches are your career.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.397
You're making good money.
I shouldn't stand in your way.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.437
I'll just go home...

21:02.760 --> 21:05.752
...and dream of you totally naked...

21:10.640 --> 21:13.438
...swarming all over me.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.319
I've got a better idea.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.915
Before I go to the college,
how about we go home...

21:19.160 --> 21:22.709
...and I give you
your own private little speech.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.955
Would you talk to me, Marcie?

21:29.280 --> 21:30.554
Talk to me.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.236
- Four score and seven years ago...
- Oh, yes!

21:34.840 --> 21:39.072
...our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation.

21:39.320 --> 21:43.313
Emancipate me! Set me free!

21:50.200 --> 21:52.760
Well, my body's dead...

21:54.400 --> 21:58.109
...but I suppose a detached head
could live on.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.871
So you had Dr. Angela
reverse the procedure?

22:04.120 --> 22:06.429
Yes. So I can no longer
speak in public...

22:06.640 --> 22:09.029
...but at least
I can please my Jefferson.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.990
- Where is Jefferson?
- In the emergency room...

22:12.240 --> 22:14.754
...being treated for dehydration.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.311
Yeah, I had my 15 minutes of fame
and made a lot of money...

22:19.560 --> 22:23.314
...but I guess, all things considered,
everything turned out okay.

22:26.280 --> 22:29.477
Yes, welcome back
to Dr. Angela's loser line.

22:29.720 --> 22:31.836
Go ahead, next caller.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.117
Yes, Dr. Angela.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.511
My name is...

22:38.760 --> 22:41.115
...Sal Undy.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.755
And I'm having a little...

22:46.000 --> 22:49.788
...ubble-tray with my enis-pay.
