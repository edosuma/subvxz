Yeah.

00:53.510 --> 00:56.340
I took a wrong turn
over by Cuba so...

00:56.390 --> 00:58.810
I'll just head out
and go get my bearings.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.350
Ha. Gringo.

01:00.390 --> 01:02.600
There'll be no heading out

01:04.560 --> 01:05.730
Why'd he send you to me?

01:05.770 --> 01:07.190
Carlos.

01:07.230 --> 01:08.730
I'll be honest with you.

Or what you're doing here.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.760
You know,
it's my first time in Mexico.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.010
I mean, it feels weird,
your first time in Mexico,

02:21.050 --> 02:22.930
to not have a Mexican stand off.

02:22.970 --> 02:24.640

In order for this to work,

Don't move.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.330

gotta lay this gun down, okay?

Hey.

I got the same board

how hard I look at it,

I just can't seem to figure out
where Jake is.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.850
I'm sure this has something
to do with Carlos.

04:26.890 --> 04:28.100
He was there with Jake.

04:28.140 --> 04:29.720

a thousand times.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.060
And he isn't telling us
anything.

04:31.350 --> 04:33.100
Well, maybe we need someone else
to talk to him.

I don't want to be here either.

Jacob Doyle.
In our conversation--

06:59.710 --> 07:01.830
You mean the five days straight,
where you interrogated me?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.880
You never told me you were
from Newfoundland.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.840
We tracked the container.

07:04.880 --> 07:06.050
First of all, I'm surprised

07:06.090 --> 07:06.880
that you even know where
Newfoundland is.

07:08.090 --> 07:10.340
Second of all,
if I knew it woulda got me

07:10.380 --> 07:11.760
out of that hell hole
of a jail sooner,

07:11.800 --> 07:13.390
trust me, I would have told you.

07:14.310 --> 07:16.810
Tell me.
Do you have any idea

07:16.850 --> 07:17.970
who this might be?

07:18.020 --> 07:19.270
[Jake]
Other than the fact that he

07:19.310 --> 07:21.190
tried to have me killed twice,
not really. Why?

07:21.230 --> 07:22.980
His name is Eli Kane.

07:23.020 --> 07:25.610
He's a former Mexican Border
Agent who is dealing arms.

07:25.650 --> 07:27.860
Now he heads one of the largest
cartels in our country.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.780
My sources tell me
that you know his

07:30.820 --> 07:31.860
Lieutenant. Carlos.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.280
Well, I'm pretty sure

07:33.320 --> 07:35.160
he's the reason why I went on
this little vacation.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.660
Why the hell
are you telling me all this?

07:36.700 --> 07:39.120
Kane is expanding his cartel
to your country.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.370
Starting in your home town.

07:40.410 --> 07:42.750
You're gonna help me catch him.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.130
Tell you what. Let me call home.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.170
And talk to my family
and I'll consider.

07:46.210 --> 07:47.420
No. You being

07:47.460 --> 07:50.050
missing gives us
a big advantage over Kane.

07:50.090 --> 07:52.380
You play along, you'll see your
family soon enough.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.470
We have a deal?

07:53.510 --> 07:54.470

07:54.510 --> 07:55.470
Why not?

08:01.140 --> 08:02.390

There's some papers

08:02.440 --> 08:04.230
to get us over the U.S. border
and into Maine.

08:04.270 --> 08:06.110
From there, I know a way

08:06.150 --> 08:07.400
to get into Newfoundland.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.190
I guess you thought of
everything, didn't you.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.360
Some fresh clothes
for clothes for you too.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.320
Our first date, and you're
already picking out outfits.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.950
Little forward,
don't you think?

08:14.990 --> 08:17.740
We have to arrest Kane in your
country and keep him there.

08:17.780 --> 08:19.370
If people in Mexico find out,

08:19.410 --> 08:21.620
he won't go to trial. And the
charges will never stick.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.040
Where is Kane now?

08:23.080 --> 08:25.000
I have information that he's
en route to St. John's.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.670
But he won't be there long.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.510
Welcome to Newfoundland.

10:02.010 --> 10:03.560
[Gabriella]
We need to be mobile.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.390
And get to work on finding
a location for Kane.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.520
Alright. Look.
We'll contact the local cops.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.270
I know someone there
who can help.

10:08.310 --> 10:09.600
No police.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.480
Police here are different. Okay?
They're not like--

10:11.520 --> 10:12.440
in your country.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.280
Hey! Watch it.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.400
No offense. I'm just saying

10:14.440 --> 10:16.570
I mean, the cops --
I don't like them.

10:16.610 --> 10:18.150
But I can actually trust them.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.990
The minute any cop talks to the
Embassy, or Mexican Police,

10:21.030 --> 10:23.410
someone on Kane's payroll will
be alerted.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.370
And Kane will return to Mexico
before we can stop him.

10:26.370 --> 10:28.080
So. Car.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.500
This one looks promising.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.170
Well, this car here is for sale.

10:35.210 --> 10:39.430
I mean, we probably should take
her for a test run, no?

10:46.730 --> 10:48.020

10:51.900 --> 10:54.730
Kane has a shipment coming in.
Probably drugs.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.320
I took down an informant.

10:57.110 --> 10:58.740
He gave me a word.

10:58.780 --> 10:59.530
Triumphante.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.030

11:03.580 --> 11:04.700
a smuggler's code name.

11:04.740 --> 11:05.950
Get in.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.250
I think I know where
we should start.

11:24.810 --> 11:25.720
Chica.

11:25.760 --> 11:25.970
Nice to see you again.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.180
I like how you're having me over
to your place now.

11:29.230 --> 11:33.610
I wanted you to be a bit more
comfortable for our little chat.

11:33.650 --> 11:35.270
[Smallwood]
Sergeant.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.650
This again?

11:36.690 --> 11:39.150
Inspector Smallwood.
I'm just following up on a lead.

11:39.190 --> 11:40.320
There are other
cases in my

11:40.360 --> 11:41.820
department that require
your attention.

11:41.860 --> 11:44.030
Understood.
This won't take long.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.620
It's already taking too long.

11:45.660 --> 11:46.870
Consider this his last visit.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.290
I'm sorry, my friend.

11:54.330 --> 11:58.710
But you have spent just a little
too much time with them.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.970
So what are we talking about
this time?

12:08.010 --> 12:10.350
I'm starting to feel like you
have some sort of thing for me.

12:10.850 --> 12:11.890
Am I right?

12:11.940 --> 12:13.980
Jake Doyle.
What did you do to him?

12:14.690 --> 12:15.940
Really? That again.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.230
Like I've said,
over and over.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.360
I have no idea who you're
talking about.

12:23.160 --> 12:23.280
[Carlos] What's this?

12:24.620 --> 12:26.660
[Leslie] A request for
Witness Protection.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.450
[Carlos] You really think this will work?

12:28.490 --> 12:30.370
That I'll flip
on my employer?

12:30.410 --> 12:33.040
Well, either you sign it
and tell me where Doyle is.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.580
Or I just leak that you did.

12:35.630 --> 12:36.960
And some of your
employer's friends

12:37.000 --> 12:37.420
can deal with you back in jail.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.800
Not bad, Blondie. But my friends
are already coming for me.

12:41.840 --> 12:45.340
It's only a matter of time
before I'm back on the street.

12:46.220 --> 12:47.510
Maybe you can drive me back.

12:47.970 --> 12:48.850
We can --

12:48.890 --> 12:50.310
talk more on the way--

12:50.930 --> 12:51.180
Oof!

12:52.270 --> 12:55.060
I told you not to test me,
Carlos.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.480
Bennett.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.520
A word.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.980
You did it this time, Blondie.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.360
Now the boss is mad.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.440
Now.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.700
You better think long
and hard

13:03.740 --> 13:04.820
about what you
choose or don't choose to say.

13:05.740 --> 13:07.870
'Cause I can guarantee you this:

13:07.910 --> 13:09.030
You're gonna be here
for a long time.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.830
And your delicate, pacific
disposition

13:12.870 --> 13:14.580
is not gonna
like our winters.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.300
[door slams]

13:20.880 --> 13:22.010
Where is this?

13:22.050 --> 13:23.460
It's my office.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.130
We gotta find a way to
track the name of that boat

13:25.180 --> 13:26.180
that you're looking for.

13:27.050 --> 13:29.180
[Grayson]
Come on, come on.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.270
[Tinny]
Did you hear that?

13:34.310 --> 13:35.480
Here what?

13:35.520 --> 13:37.810
The sound of you avoiding making
out with me?

13:37.850 --> 13:38.770
Yeah. I hear it.

13:38.810 --> 13:39.730
[sound of drink spilling]

13:39.770 --> 13:41.400
-Oh!
-Whoa.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.860
I'm sorry.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.530
As romantic as it is

13:45.570 --> 13:48.030
to make out in an alleyway
in broad daylight,

13:48.070 --> 13:50.240
we should head back in.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.750
Fine. That's just fine man.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.250
Grayson.

13:54.290 --> 13:56.000
Relax, okay?

13:56.040 --> 13:58.420
Just learn how to hold your
booze a little better.

13:58.460 --> 14:00.090
And you'll have a much better
shot at getting me naked.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.470
Let's go back in side with your
day boiled Rugby friends.

14:15.810 --> 14:17.100
Who's that?

14:17.140 --> 14:18.850
My niece.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.610
And a soon to be dead guy.

14:20.650 --> 14:21.480
Charming.

14:22.980 --> 14:23.900
Poppy.

14:23.940 --> 14:24.740
What are you at?

14:24.780 --> 14:25.860
This is it.

14:25.900 --> 14:26.780
[Ned] Anything
to drink for the lovely

14:26.820 --> 14:28.030
off-duty
police officer?

14:28.070 --> 14:29.490
Just ginger ale, please.

14:29.530 --> 14:30.570
Beer for me.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.080
Listen,
Thanks again for this, Mal.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.910
Really appreciate it.
It's only temporary.

14:33.950 --> 14:36.120
As soon as I pay off four or
five of them loans,

14:36.870 --> 14:38.210
I'll be on my way.

14:38.250 --> 14:39.540
Good man.

14:39.580 --> 14:40.500
And this pint--

14:40.540 --> 14:42.250
is on me. I insist.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.250
But it would be great

14:44.300 --> 14:45.340
if you could just
take it outta my cheque,

14:45.380 --> 14:47.470
as well as a bag of chips
over there.

14:47.510 --> 14:48.800
[Grayson]
What!

14:48.840 --> 14:51.140
[loud laughing]

14:51.180 --> 14:52.390
On a date?

14:52.430 --> 14:54.470
I guess you
could call it that.

14:54.510 --> 14:55.930
He's starting
to get on my nerves.

14:55.970 --> 14:57.310
You can always burn him off.

14:57.350 --> 14:59.060
He's not bad when it's just
the two of us.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.310
They never are.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.320
This might sound weird,
but--

15:04.360 --> 15:08.280
Do you ever feel
like you see Jake?

15:08.320 --> 15:10.070
Like you know he's not there,
but--

15:10.110 --> 15:12.660
You miss him. It's normal.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.660
But you can't let it

15:14.700 --> 15:15.620
take over your life.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.290
He'll be back

15:17.330 --> 15:19.000
driving us all crazy
before you know it.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.710
You're young.
Enjoy your night.

15:22.750 --> 15:23.630
Thanks.

15:24.750 --> 15:25.630
[clink]

15:32.050 --> 15:33.350
[thud from above]

15:36.680 --> 15:37.430
Sorry.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.310
Oh, it's okay.

15:39.350 --> 15:43.980
It's obvious someone's made some
changes around here.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.780
You okay?

15:47.360 --> 15:48.990
Yeah. I mean--

15:49.030 --> 15:52.320
Obviously it looks like my
family thinks that I'm dead.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.240
It seems a tad cruel

15:54.280 --> 15:56.410
to let them go on
thinking that, don't you think?

15:56.450 --> 15:57.830
We've been over this.

15:57.870 --> 15:58.910
You'll put their
lives in jeopardy.

15:58.950 --> 16:01.460
And blow the entire operation.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.170
Plus-- How do you know they're
not slightly relieved?

16:04.590 --> 16:05.920
Ha, ha.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.010
[Jake] Now. If you're a boat
in St. John's harbor,

16:09.420 --> 16:11.550
then you're listed on the Port
Authority's website.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.720
Triunfante...

16:16.760 --> 16:18.560
isn't here.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.060
What did you say that word
was again?

16:20.100 --> 16:21.890
Triunfante.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.230
What does that mean
in English?

16:24.270 --> 16:27.690
Umm... Victory, success,
winning.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.530
Success.

16:33.570 --> 16:34.570
There's a boat here called

16:34.610 --> 16:36.620
Victorious.
Does that work?

16:36.660 --> 16:38.240
That has to be him.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.330
[Mal]
Hold it!

16:40.370 --> 16:41.250
Jake?

16:41.290 --> 16:42.290
Hey! Dad!

16:42.870 --> 16:44.000
You're alive!

16:45.420 --> 16:46.880
Tell me this wasn't
about a girl.

16:47.460 --> 16:48.380
Sort of.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.630
You little shit!

16:49.670 --> 16:51.050
You didn't think that would be
good information

16:51.090 --> 16:52.010
to tell me?

16:52.050 --> 16:53.340
That my son isn't dead?

16:53.380 --> 16:54.800
Just--

16:54.840 --> 16:55.800
Okay. I just got back.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.010
Hey, I'd like you
to meet someone.

16:57.050 --> 16:57.680
I can explain.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.930
Jake.

16:58.970 --> 17:01.220
You've done some rotten things
in your life.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.020
Was a phone call
too much to ask?

17:03.770 --> 17:05.230
A frickin' text message?

17:05.270 --> 17:06.440
Mr. Doyle, I'm assuming.
I can

17:06.480 --> 17:08.690
explain.
I'm a Mexican police officer.

17:08.730 --> 17:09.650
Yeah.

17:09.690 --> 17:11.990
And we're undercover,
sort of.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.440
We're tracking
a notorious killer.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.240
I need Jake's help to stop him.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.490
Yeah.
And we just got a lead.

17:17.530 --> 17:18.740
Okay? And if you're not gonna
have a heart attack,

17:18.780 --> 17:20.740
I could really use some backup.
So...

17:20.780 --> 17:22.700
Can you let me explain this
whole thing in the car, or what?

17:24.370 --> 17:26.960
It's taking everything out of me
not to flatten you right now.

17:29.540 --> 17:30.420
Okay.

17:31.840 --> 17:32.800
Let's go.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.890
Hey. Did Poppy come down?
I saw him go up.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.850
I'm not sure. You don't know how
to change over a keg, do ya?

17:44.890 --> 17:46.980
I kinda glazed over when Mal
showed me that part.

17:47.020 --> 17:47.940
Sorry.

17:47.980 --> 17:48.860
Buzz me up?

17:53.940 --> 17:55.740
Poppy?

18:09.920 --> 18:11.290
[door slams]

18:11.340 --> 18:12.750
[Smallwood] The Mexican
authorities are all over us.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.760
And you're in there causing an
international incident.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.340
And it's all for Jake Doyle,
I'm guessing.

18:16.380 --> 18:18.590
Inspector Smallwood,
with all due respect,

18:18.630 --> 18:20.350
we all know there's
more to Jake's disappearance

18:20.390 --> 18:21.800
than Carlos is letting on.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.970
Drop it.
You turned down the Federal

18:24.020 --> 18:26.350
Task Force job because
Doyle disappeared.

18:26.390 --> 18:28.020
I promoted you
to be my Number One.

18:28.060 --> 18:29.270
Extra pay.

18:29.310 --> 18:30.860
An office with a window.
What's not to like here?

18:31.650 --> 18:32.650
Do not let Jake Doyle's

18:32.690 --> 18:35.320
ghost drag you down.
Please.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.570
His ghost.

18:36.610 --> 18:38.780
What I mean is,
you have to accept the fact,

18:38.820 --> 18:40.870
that Doyle is likely dead.

18:40.910 --> 18:43.490
And the details of what happened
to him buried with him.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.410
Move on.

18:45.580 --> 18:46.870
So.

18:46.910 --> 18:49.080
What do we do with Carlos?
Back to Her Majesty's?

18:49.120 --> 18:50.040
Send him back.

18:50.080 --> 18:50.290
No.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.800
Let's turn the AC on bust
and let him sit there.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.130
I think I'll go
with your answer.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.430
I'm serious.
You gotta let it go.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.390
He's dead.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.380
This one. It's the only one not
on the manifest.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.790
So whatever Kane is shipping,
it must be in here.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.050
If you're right and this thing
is full to the brim with drugs--

19:37.090 --> 19:38.720
That's enough
to take Kane down.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.970
If we catch him.

19:41.930 --> 19:42.800
[bang]

19:53.520 --> 19:54.560
These guys.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.280
They don't
look like drugs to me.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.070
Lock the doors.
Scan the parking lot.

20:03.110 --> 20:04.870
And search the place
floor by floor, now.

20:04.910 --> 20:05.830
Done.

20:05.870 --> 20:07.120
[Leslie]
Did anybody see anything?

20:07.160 --> 20:09.160
Who the hell got in there?

20:10.330 --> 20:11.750
The cameras went out in there

20:11.790 --> 20:13.380
seconds before
Carlos was killed.

20:14.290 --> 20:16.210
Someone is sending a message.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.630
The killers wanted to rub our
faces in it.

20:19.840 --> 20:20.800
You okay?

20:20.840 --> 20:22.130
It's just--

20:22.170 --> 20:25.470
Carlos was the only person could
help us find Jake.

20:25.510 --> 20:26.550
[Tinny]
Leslie.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.850
I need your help.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.100
I think something happened
to my grandfather.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.020
What? Are you sure?

20:31.060 --> 20:33.600
Yeah. He went up to the office,
and then just disappeared.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.110
Leslie?

20:42.900 --> 20:44.280
Leslie, what's going on?

20:44.320 --> 20:47.070
Tinny. I know you're worried.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.030
But I'm in the middle of
something.

20:48.080 --> 20:48.990
Well, we can talk on the way.

20:55.670 --> 20:56.960
[Mal] What are we
tangled up in here?

20:57.000 --> 20:57.960
[Jake]
Maybe Kane's

20:58.000 --> 20:59.210
shipping human cargo.

20:59.250 --> 21:02.300
Nothing about that man
surprises me.

21:02.340 --> 21:03.550
I'm gonna grab the car.

21:03.590 --> 21:05.680
We have to get these
guys to the authorities.

21:07.340 --> 21:08.720
[Jake] Someone went
through a lot of trouble

21:08.760 --> 21:11.350
to get these guys here.
It must have cost a fortune

21:13.810 --> 21:14.690
[tires screeching]

21:15.770 --> 21:16.980
Get that door.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.860
Jacob Doyle.

21:23.900 --> 21:27.740
Why is it that every time I open
up a container, there you are?

21:27.780 --> 21:30.490
I just wanna make sure you get
your packages on time, Kane.

21:30.530 --> 21:33.120
Or should I call you
Constable now, maybe.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.540
You can call me
whatever you want.

21:34.580 --> 21:37.130
But this is the last time
you and I play this game.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.960
Kane. Drop it.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.510
Gabriella.
I thought you'd know better.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.720
Stay here and call for backup.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.510
I wanna help.

21:46.550 --> 21:50.470
Call for backup and stay with
the car. That's an order.

21:51.680 --> 21:52.640
Drop it.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.600
I'd do what she says, man.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.810
'Cause when it comes to dealing
with tools, she doesn't bluff.

21:56.850 --> 21:58.310
Yeah, well she knows
I don't bluff either.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.400
Isn't this right,
Gabriella?

22:00.020 --> 22:01.480
Lower your gun.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.360
You can't win this.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.610
[Leslie] I don't know
what's going on!

22:04.650 --> 22:06.950
But I'm Sergeant Leslie Bennett
of the RNC.

22:06.990 --> 22:08.030
And you're all under arrest.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.620
So put your firearms down.

22:10.660 --> 22:12.700
And put your hands
where I can see them.

22:13.370 --> 22:14.700
Jake? What?

22:14.750 --> 22:15.660
You're alive?

22:15.710 --> 22:17.120
[Kane]
Unfortunately.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.080
Jake. Who is she?

22:18.120 --> 22:19.080
Good question. Jake.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.210
Who is she?

22:20.250 --> 22:21.460
[Kane]
Ho, ho! This is awkward.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.840
A terrible way to find out about
the other woman.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.090
Shut up, Kane.

22:25.130 --> 22:26.800
Leslie, I can explain.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.470
Okay. I need everyone to relax.

22:29.510 --> 22:30.970
Uncle Jake!

22:31.010 --> 22:32.100
Tinny, no!

22:32.850 --> 22:35.310
This is family. Nice.

22:35.890 --> 22:38.440
Just... Kane.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.310
How about you point the gun
at me, okay?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.770
Because we both know, I'm the
one that you want dead.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.150
Maybe I'll just kill you both.

22:45.190 --> 22:46.070
Put the gun down now.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.200
[Gabriella]
Do it.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.360
You have two against one.
You don't have a lot of options.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.160
Looks like there's only one way
out of this.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.830
[explosion]

23:05.300 --> 23:06.510
I can't believe it's you.

23:06.550 --> 23:07.590
Where have you been?

23:07.630 --> 23:09.170
I'll tell you.
But you gotta promise me

23:09.220 --> 23:11.430
you're not going out with that
weird little, you know, cop guy.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.180
Son.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.520
I can explain.

23:19.810 --> 23:20.690
Sort of.

23:23.650 --> 23:25.070
[Smallwood] You disobeyed a direct order.

23:25.110 --> 23:27.610
You jeopardized the safety of
a fellow officer,

23:27.650 --> 23:29.740
not to mention civilians.

23:29.780 --> 23:33.030
And worst of all, you do all of
this while inebriated.

23:33.070 --> 23:34.200
I wasn't drinking sir.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.950
Save it for your union rep.

23:36.990 --> 23:38.750
I can't wait to meet
this Jake Doyle guy.

23:38.790 --> 23:40.040
He seems to have a

23:40.080 --> 23:42.750
serious influence
over some of my officers.

23:42.790 --> 23:43.630
In the meantime--

23:44.750 --> 23:46.380
You're suspended
until further notice.

23:50.550 --> 23:53.260
Please tell me you weren't on a
beach somewhere all this time

23:53.300 --> 23:55.800
with that young girl while we
were all mourning your death.

23:55.850 --> 23:58.640
No b'y Dad. I was locked
in a Mexican prison.

23:58.680 --> 23:59.680
She busted me out

23:59.730 --> 24:01.020
And why would she do that?

24:01.060 --> 24:04.150
Because she needed my help
to track down Kane.

24:04.190 --> 24:05.230
Nothing's ever simple
with you, is it?

24:05.270 --> 24:06.480
What do you want me to say?

24:06.520 --> 24:07.480
I am sorry that I was shipped
off to Mexico.

24:08.610 --> 24:10.490
And locked in
a hell hole of a prison.

24:10.530 --> 24:12.400
I thought you--

24:12.450 --> 24:13.740
I thought I might not
see you again.

24:13.780 --> 24:14.700
Disappointed?

24:14.740 --> 24:15.200
No, Jake.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.580
I am really glad
to see you.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.710
That's the truth.

24:21.960 --> 24:22.750
Malachy?

24:23.670 --> 24:25.290
Can we have a moment, please?

24:25.340 --> 24:26.250
Sure.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.210
Of course.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.140
[slap]

24:37.180 --> 24:38.510
Why didn't you tell me
you were alive?

24:38.560 --> 24:40.140
We all thought
you were dead, Jake.

24:40.180 --> 24:41.140
Ow.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.360
[slap]

24:48.980 --> 24:50.490
Will you stop it?

24:50.530 --> 24:52.320
Now what is going on?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.070
Who is that Mexican cop?

24:54.110 --> 24:57.070
Okay. Her name is Gabriella.
She's after Kane.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.700
The head of a Mexican cartel.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.620
He's expanding
his business here in Canada.

25:00.660 --> 25:03.290
He's the fella who shipped those
four migrants here.

25:04.540 --> 25:06.750
How do you get yourself
into these messes?

25:09.380 --> 25:11.010
Why are you smiling?

25:11.050 --> 25:12.760
I'm just happy to see your face.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.010
Honestly, I never thought
I'd see it again.

25:16.050 --> 25:17.600
And it was killing me.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.810
Sorry for all this.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.650
Where's Gabriella now?

25:35.200 --> 25:40.490
You know, asking whereabouts
of a hot Mexican cop

25:40.530 --> 25:42.750
shouldn't be the first thing out
of your mouth after we...

25:43.160 --> 25:44.330
do that.

25:44.370 --> 25:47.000
Don't worry. I mean,
you're the only hot--

25:47.040 --> 25:51.960
Mexican cop,
that I'd ever be interested in.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.090
But seriously,
I think she needs our help.

25:54.130 --> 25:54.670
We had her fixed up.

25:56.010 --> 25:58.300
And had a cruiser drop
her off at your office.

25:58.340 --> 25:59.430
Right.

25:59.470 --> 26:02.180
But did I mention
that you're hot and--

26:02.890 --> 26:04.430
And that I love you.

26:04.470 --> 26:08.940
Wait here. And I'll get your
release papers for you.

26:10.230 --> 26:12.360
And I love you too.

26:16.150 --> 26:18.910
Bennett. What the
hell are you doing?

26:20.910 --> 26:22.280
Okay, So Hood told me
they've searched

26:22.330 --> 26:24.450
and interrogated
the migrants from the container.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.330
There's no sign of drugs
or guns on them.

26:26.370 --> 26:27.750
And they're looking for a fourth
migrant who took off.

26:27.790 --> 26:28.580
Now, firstly--

26:28.630 --> 26:29.670
Mal.

26:29.710 --> 26:31.380
You need a phone
with a better camera.

26:31.420 --> 26:32.840
You can't capture life's

26:32.880 --> 26:34.090
special moments with this.

26:34.130 --> 26:35.550
And secondly,
I enhanced the image

26:35.590 --> 26:36.920
with the new software
that Jake bought me.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.840
Jake's been missing for months.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.510
Okay. He doesn't know
that he bought it for me yet,

26:40.550 --> 26:42.050
but, It was one of those--

26:42.100 --> 26:44.560
I was thinking about you, while
I was at a foreign prison,

26:44.600 --> 26:45.680
kind of thing.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.310
Des. The men you found
in the container.

26:47.350 --> 26:50.020
Right. Well, they seem to be,
like, regular customers

26:50.060 --> 26:52.020
who paid a mint for Kane to ship
them into the country.

26:52.060 --> 26:53.110
[Jake]
I know I would have.

26:53.150 --> 26:56.650
Ah, Jake. Oh my gosh.

26:57.610 --> 26:58.910
We were worried sick.

26:58.950 --> 26:59.950
It's a long story.

26:59.990 --> 27:01.120
And I'll explain
it to you all later.

27:02.780 --> 27:03.790
Wassup?

27:04.910 --> 27:06.160
Wassup?

27:06.200 --> 27:08.040
Oh my God! Dude.
I missed you so much.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.580
Okay. Yeah.

27:09.620 --> 27:11.420
I missed you too,
buddy. I did.

27:11.460 --> 27:13.630
But I gotta hear more about
these migrants, alright?

27:13.670 --> 27:14.880
Let go!

27:14.920 --> 27:16.710
They're being held in a
government facility

27:16.760 --> 27:19.470
until their refugee claim
can be processed.

27:19.510 --> 27:22.260
But the only link they have to
Kane is that they paid him.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.050
Okay. Let us know if you find
out anything else.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.720
Dad we should go check
on Gabriella.

27:25.770 --> 27:26.770
She's back at the office.

27:26.810 --> 27:28.560
We have so much
catching up to do.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.650
And don't worry. I'll bring back
all your jeans from my closet.

27:31.690 --> 27:32.940
I wore them.

27:32.980 --> 27:35.230
You're know, they're
a surprisingly tight fit.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.030
[Mal]
And let's look

27:37.070 --> 27:38.490
into this Gabriella.

27:38.530 --> 27:40.410
I'm not a hundred percent sure
she's on the up and up.

27:40.780 --> 27:41.780
Jake.

27:41.820 --> 27:43.120
Ah, you're staying with me,
Kiddo.

27:43.160 --> 27:43.780
Okay.

27:44.410 --> 27:45.700
Where'd you park?

27:45.740 --> 27:47.830
Around the corner.
But--

27:47.870 --> 27:49.290
You might want to drive.

27:56.710 --> 27:59.170
I knew you'd get
to drive her again.

28:03.930 --> 28:05.470
We might wanna hurry.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.140
Oh yeah. Right.

28:21.070 --> 28:21.950
Oh God.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.330
Gabriella.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.000
Where is she?

28:34.040 --> 28:35.590
[phone sound]

28:37.420 --> 28:39.340
Meet me at this address,
signed G.

28:39.380 --> 28:40.670
Gabriella.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.090
Let's go.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.110
Gabriella!

28:58.730 --> 28:59.690
Let's split up.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.290
[smack]

29:18.340 --> 29:19.090
Argh!

29:19.630 --> 29:21.460
Jake Doyle.

29:21.510 --> 29:22.760
This must be your father.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.260
Nice to meet you.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.680
It's kinda fitting

29:25.720 --> 29:27.300
that we find you here
in a junk yard, don't you think?

29:27.340 --> 29:29.560
What can I say? You got me.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.310
Enough games, Kane.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.140
Where's Gabriella?

29:32.180 --> 29:33.430
In good time.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.600
[phone rings]

29:37.650 --> 29:38.810
Rose.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.190
I've been looking into
Gabriella. Bad news.

29:41.230 --> 29:42.490
Turns out she's
under investigation

29:42.530 --> 29:43.240
by the Mexican police.

29:43.610 --> 29:44.740
What?

29:44.780 --> 29:45.950
Yeah, exactly. And wait,
there's more.

29:46.780 --> 29:47.910
Turns out Gabriella is--

29:47.950 --> 29:49.240
Gabriella?

29:50.080 --> 29:51.040
Hang up.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.700
I have to call you back.

29:54.870 --> 29:56.000
What is this?

29:56.040 --> 29:57.630
[Gabriella]
I'm sorry Jake.

29:57.670 --> 29:58.710
But I had no other play.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.960
You didn't tell him,
did you?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.960
Tell me what?

30:03.010 --> 30:04.550
She's my wife.

30:04.590 --> 30:05.930
Oh, well, that's just--

30:06.510 --> 30:07.510
That's great.

30:07.930 --> 30:09.300
Jake, I--

30:09.340 --> 30:11.430
I know you're going to need some
time to process that.

30:11.470 --> 30:13.270
So just take
all the time you need.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.640
[punch]

30:14.680 --> 30:15.560
[clunk]

30:28.240 --> 30:29.200
Where are we?

30:29.820 --> 30:30.950
We're in a car.

30:32.830 --> 30:33.950
Jake.

30:36.250 --> 30:37.580
I think we're in the air.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.510
I think you're right.

30:50.340 --> 30:51.600
[Des] Whoa, whoa. Look at this.

30:54.310 --> 30:58.270
Pardon. Por drias ver esto,
por favor.

30:58.310 --> 31:00.270
See this is the same tattoo,
right?

31:00.310 --> 31:02.610
But the base is different.
Do you see it?

31:02.650 --> 31:03.690
Yeah. They are lines.

31:03.730 --> 31:05.730
That's what I thought.
Great minds.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.950
But on closer inspection,
they're actually Roman numerals.

31:08.990 --> 31:10.950
Or: Numeros Romanos.

31:10.990 --> 31:11.910
Like, this one here -

31:11.950 --> 31:13.950
That one's a three. That's four.

31:13.990 --> 31:15.790
And Hector here.
Hector's a five.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.660
So it's not just branding.
These represent, like a rank

31:18.710 --> 31:19.830
of some kind.

31:19.870 --> 31:21.420
-What do you mean?
-Like, all these guys.

31:21.460 --> 31:23.880
They could be
soldiers in Kane's organization.

31:25.130 --> 31:26.010
So Carlos--
He's only a two.

31:27.420 --> 31:29.420
Does that mean they're all
ranked higher than him?

31:29.470 --> 31:30.430
Well that would mean,
that these men--

31:30.470 --> 31:32.840
They're not refugees.
But--

31:32.890 --> 31:36.060
Hardcore criminals.
Even worse than Carlos.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.430
The migrants are Kane's
lieutenants, in his cartel.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.310
That must be how he's
expanding his operation,

31:40.350 --> 31:41.770
by smuggling them into town.

31:41.810 --> 31:43.440
From here, Kane can stick them
anywhere in the country.

31:43.480 --> 31:44.690
Or the U.S.

31:44.730 --> 31:45.650
Only it's pronounced
"Lef" tenant,

31:45.690 --> 31:46.400
just FYI.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.530
I gotta call Leslie.

31:48.570 --> 31:50.410
[Des] They'll rue the day they
ever suspended you, Tinny.

31:51.450 --> 31:52.320
Rue the day.

31:54.870 --> 31:55.790
It's locked.

31:55.830 --> 31:56.740
I know!

31:56.790 --> 31:57.620
You're some detective.

31:57.660 --> 31:58.790
Just knock it off, alright.

31:58.830 --> 32:00.370
This whole thing isn't
entirely my fault.

32:02.710 --> 32:03.790
[phone rings]

32:03.830 --> 32:04.750
[Jake]
My phone's ringing.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.050
Where is it?

32:10.090 --> 32:11.430
Gabriella.

32:11.470 --> 32:13.430
Gabrie--!
[disconnect sound]

32:14.430 --> 32:15.720
She left us the key.
Why?

32:15.760 --> 32:17.220
Who cares?
Open the lock.

32:17.260 --> 32:18.600
Alright, b'y.
Alright.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.020
You do it.
Don't drop it.

32:25.980 --> 32:28.190
I gotta stop this guy from
dropping us on the ground.

32:28.230 --> 32:29.150
Don't break your neck.

32:30.530 --> 32:31.990
Don't pretend, that,
like you care.

32:32.410 --> 32:33.280
Whoa!

32:33.320 --> 32:34.240
Jake!

32:34.280 --> 32:35.160
I got it. I'm okay!

32:38.740 --> 32:39.620
[Jake]
Hey!

32:46.170 --> 32:47.050
Hey!

32:48.460 --> 32:49.340
Shut it down!

32:52.760 --> 32:56.390
[crash]

32:57.430 --> 32:58.680
Dad!

32:59.890 --> 33:01.390
Dad!

33:01.430 --> 33:02.310
[Mal]
What?

33:03.600 --> 33:04.480
[phone text sound]

33:06.230 --> 33:08.190
I got a text
from Rose.

33:08.230 --> 33:09.150
I know where
the migrants are.

33:09.190 --> 33:10.070
Come on!

33:17.120 --> 33:19.740
[tires screech]

33:22.290 --> 33:23.250
Arrgh.

33:25.330 --> 33:26.210
Nobody move!

33:27.460 --> 33:29.250
[bang]

33:29.290 --> 33:30.090
Jake.
What the hell is going on?

33:31.380 --> 33:34.260
Leslie. The migrants
are Kane's lieutenants.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.760
Here's one gift wrapped for you.
I gotta go.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.260
You're the one that called me.
Where are you going?

33:38.300 --> 33:39.180
Sorry.

33:41.970 --> 33:43.600
[tires screeching]

33:49.360 --> 33:50.320
[tires screeching]

33:59.830 --> 34:00.620
[banging]

34:00.660 --> 34:02.040
You didn't happen to

34:02.080 --> 34:03.370
put a bulletproof windshield
in this thing, did you?

34:03.410 --> 34:04.460
You're lucky I replaced
the cardboard.

34:05.370 --> 34:07.920
[gun clicks] [out of bullets]

34:08.580 --> 34:09.540
Great. Now what?

34:13.920 --> 34:15.130
Jake!

34:17.800 --> 34:18.720
Gabriella!

34:18.760 --> 34:19.890
Jake!

34:19.930 --> 34:22.350
Kane. He has my son.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.900
Where's Kane?

34:32.520 --> 34:36.200
How is he transporting himself
and his lieutenants into Canada?

34:37.650 --> 34:38.820
Are you gonna say anything?

34:40.660 --> 34:42.790
Fine. You can rot in here,
for all I care.

34:43.700 --> 34:45.080
You know this would have been

34:45.120 --> 34:47.000
a lot easier if you were
straight with me from the start.

34:47.790 --> 34:49.420
I had to get Benito back.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.540
I'm sorry. I should have been
more straight forward.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.420
I married Kane, thinking he was

34:55.460 --> 34:57.050
a simple business man.

34:57.800 --> 34:59.640
We had a son, Benito.

35:01.510 --> 35:03.560
And then I found out the truth.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.100
Kane was a criminal.

35:05.060 --> 35:07.180
So I took Benito.
And I left.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.310
I take it that didn't go over
so well with Kane.

35:09.350 --> 35:11.310
He came after me.
And he took Benito.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.480
My father tried to stop him.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.860
Kane killed him.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.410
I've been trying to take him
down to get my son since.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.530
He promised he'd give him back
to me if I--

35:24.160 --> 35:25.620
If you killed me.

35:25.660 --> 35:26.250
You're an obstacle to Kane.

35:27.450 --> 35:29.460
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have involved you.

35:30.330 --> 35:31.500
I just --

35:31.540 --> 35:33.250
I had no other choice.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.590
I want Benito back.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.380
He's my world.

35:38.630 --> 35:41.390
I tell you what.
We'll figure something out.

35:42.550 --> 35:44.060
I promise.

35:47.180 --> 35:49.140
Don't stop on my account.

35:50.230 --> 35:52.730
Your man in there.
He's not talking.

35:52.770 --> 35:54.980
He won't.
He's as tough as they come.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.480
You got any other leads?

35:56.520 --> 35:59.240
I know Kane was supposed to
leave the city tonight.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.950
But my sources didn't know how.

36:00.990 --> 36:02.410
[Jake]
What is this?

36:02.450 --> 36:04.450
We found it next to
Carlos' body.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.120
I assume now
it's from Kane.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.330
I haven't seen him leave one of
those in a while.

36:08.370 --> 36:09.410
He wanted to make a statement

36:09.450 --> 36:10.750
that no one is safe from him.

36:11.710 --> 36:13.290
[Jake]
Has Hector seen this?

36:13.330 --> 36:14.630
[Leslie]
No.

36:14.670 --> 36:16.500
I think I got an idea of how
to get some answers.

36:31.020 --> 36:33.020
[knocking]

36:37.150 --> 36:39.490
Man, there is nothing like
the fear of getting whacked

36:39.530 --> 36:41.110
to get a guy talking.

36:41.150 --> 36:42.900
Once Gabriella gets all
the information we need,

36:42.950 --> 36:44.780
we'll get all hands on deck.

36:44.820 --> 36:46.530
I've got first hand experience
with Kane.

36:46.570 --> 36:48.740
I think we should be really
discreet about this.

36:50.120 --> 36:53.080
Okay.
We'll do it your way.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.250
Leslie.

36:56.710 --> 36:58.420
I really missed you.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.830
We should take Kane now when
he's unprepared.

37:32.870 --> 37:34.080
Wait. Hold on.
Where's the third guy?

37:34.120 --> 37:35.210
Kane!

37:35.250 --> 37:36.120
You.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.130
How did you find me?

37:37.170 --> 37:38.090
[Gabriella]
Hector seem to think

37:38.130 --> 37:39.670
you don't need him
any more.

37:40.800 --> 37:41.800
Now, where's my boy?

37:43.590 --> 37:44.720
Get on the ground, Kane.

37:44.760 --> 37:45.930
I'd do what she says.

37:45.970 --> 37:46.930
Just give us the kid.

37:46.970 --> 37:48.850
I can't do that my friend.

37:48.890 --> 37:49.970
[banging]

37:50.010 --> 37:50.930
Get down!

37:50.970 --> 37:51.930
[bang]

37:51.970 --> 37:52.850
[bang]

37:52.890 --> 37:53.850
[bang]

37:53.890 --> 37:55.140
Cover me.

37:56.270 --> 37:57.310
Hey!

37:57.350 --> 37:58.270
[punch]

38:00.110 --> 38:01.480
[truck starting sound]

38:03.530 --> 38:04.740
Argh!

38:04.780 --> 38:05.740
[punch]

38:06.820 --> 38:07.660
Whoa!

38:10.530 --> 38:11.410
[punch]

38:30.720 --> 38:32.430
Where is he?

38:32.470 --> 38:33.640
Where's Benito?

38:33.680 --> 38:34.890
Our son is safe.

38:34.930 --> 38:36.810
Safe is far away from you.

38:36.850 --> 38:38.190
Yeah, but you're gonna
have to let me go.

38:38.230 --> 38:40.060
Or you'll never see him again.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.400
Look.

38:42.440 --> 38:43.780
It might feel good.

38:43.820 --> 38:44.940
But it's not gonna help.

38:47.530 --> 38:49.950
I shoulda known
you'd never leave without him.

39:12.430 --> 39:15.140
Hello there.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.350
Looking for this?

39:25.610 --> 39:26.570
Safe and sound.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.080
So. What now?

39:40.540 --> 39:44.000
Kane will be detained here.
Hopefully, permanently.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.550
I can't go back to Mexico.

39:47.630 --> 39:49.430
Where do you think
you'll end up?

39:50.180 --> 39:53.680
Well. I do like it here.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.260
It's a great place to live.

39:56.010 --> 39:57.270
Thank you for helping

39:57.310 --> 39:58.480
me and my son.

39:59.390 --> 40:00.600
I don't want to even think about

40:00.640 --> 40:02.480
what could have
happened without you.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
It was my pleasure.

40:06.860 --> 40:07.860
Ahem.

40:09.150 --> 40:10.860
Goodbye Jake.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.570
I hope to see you again.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.120
Yeah. That would be nice.

40:18.620 --> 40:19.870
That would be nice?

40:22.670 --> 40:23.750
Yeah.

40:23.790 --> 40:27.630
I meant that in a purely
Platonic sense.

40:27.670 --> 40:29.300
We'd better head to the Duke.

40:29.340 --> 40:31.300
Your entire family's
waiting for you.

40:31.340 --> 40:33.640
Does that mean
you'll be my date?

40:33.680 --> 40:35.300
I'd better be your date.

40:43.690 --> 40:44.690
[cork popping]

40:44.730 --> 40:45.940
[Mal]
To my not yet

40:45.980 --> 40:47.860
dead son, Jake.

40:47.900 --> 40:49.190
How poetic.

40:49.230 --> 40:50.610
But fitting, don't you think?

40:50.650 --> 40:51.900
Isn't this wicked?

40:51.950 --> 40:53.650
All pretty awesome.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.870
Good to see ya, Jake.
Here's a bottle on the house.

40:55.910 --> 40:58.540
What? Ned?
Why is Ned behind the bar?

40:58.580 --> 40:59.490
I works here.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.450
We hired him.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.370
Cheers.

41:02.580 --> 41:03.710
You okay?

41:03.750 --> 41:05.250
[Tinny]
Yeah. Yeah.

41:05.290 --> 41:07.750
My suspension's up
for review next week.

41:07.790 --> 41:09.210
I feel like an idiot, though.

41:09.250 --> 41:11.840
Hey. Hey. Look.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.380
You were helping your family.

41:14.430 --> 41:18.810
And in my books, that makes you
an non-idiot like person.

41:18.850 --> 41:20.100
Thanks.

41:20.140 --> 41:21.640
Well, at least Leslie told
Inspector Smallwood

41:21.680 --> 41:22.770
that I brought
the tattoo thing in.

41:22.810 --> 41:24.140
So he's gonna take that
into account.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.600
Good.

41:26.980 --> 41:28.610
I'm just so happy Jake's back.

41:28.650 --> 41:29.610
Yeah, me too.

41:29.650 --> 41:31.150
[Mal]
Ah, Jake.

41:31.860 --> 41:33.280
I--

41:34.030 --> 41:35.530
We all are

41:35.570 --> 41:36.660
so glad

41:36.700 --> 41:39.200
to see you back home
safe and sound.

41:39.240 --> 41:40.450
And we all--

41:42.000 --> 41:44.120
I--
really missed you.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.330
Here, here.

41:45.370 --> 41:46.920
[Mal]
Oh, and Jake.

41:47.540 --> 41:48.710
Enjoy this toast.

41:48.750 --> 41:50.420
'Cause it's the last one
you'll hear from me,

41:50.460 --> 41:51.920
until ye two get hitched.

41:51.960 --> 41:52.880
[Rose]
Oh, come one.

41:52.920 --> 41:53.920
Although a wedding

41:53.970 --> 41:55.220
would be nice.

41:56.720 --> 41:57.890
[glass tinkling]

41:57.930 --> 41:59.100
[Des] Oh, sorry I thought
we were supposed--

41:59.140 --> 42:00.470
Aren't we supposed to
tap the glasses

42:00.510 --> 42:02.140
to get 'em to kiss? Okay.

42:02.180 --> 42:03.310
Drinks on the house!

42:03.350 --> 42:04.480
No, no! Shut up.

42:04.520 --> 42:06.310
It's a miscommunication.

42:06.350 --> 42:07.900
This isn't your house.

42:07.940 --> 42:10.520
By the way, if you disappear
like that again,

42:10.570 --> 42:13.190
don't bother coming back.
I'm just saying.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.570
I promise.

42:16.150 --> 42:17.910
I will never leave your side.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.120
Man it's good to be home.

42:24.790 --> 42:25.790
Cheers, everyone.

42:25.830 --> 42:27.000
Cheers, Cheers.
