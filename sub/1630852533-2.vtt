00:00.934 --> 00:01.900
<i> [Amy] Will was very nervous</i>
<i>  on the phone.</i>

00:01.902 --> 00:05.704
<i>  He is legit terrified</i>
<i>  at this point.</i>

00:05.706 --> 00:07.840
[Will] I call it
the stairway from hell.

00:07.842 --> 00:08.741
I just got this awful feeling.

00:08.743 --> 00:10.142
I feel like
I want to cry right now

00:10.144 --> 00:12.277
and I'm shaking for
no particular reason at all.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.078
[Amy] Okay.

00:13.080 --> 00:17.082
The way he reacted
was alarming.

00:17.084 --> 00:20.686
<i> [Amy] There's a small anomaly</i>
<i>  trying to climb into</i>
<i>  the rocker.</i>

00:20.688 --> 00:22.187
-On top of it?
-Yeah.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.922
I just don't like this place.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.891
Everyone's afraid.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.426
They are, they're all afraid.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.428
They're coming. Footsteps.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.363
That's scary [bleep].

00:34.001 --> 00:35.801
<i> [Amy] The dead want a voice.</i>

00:35.803 --> 00:37.403
We just want
to help this family.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.771
<i> [Adam] The living</i>
<i>  need our help.</i>

00:38.773 --> 00:39.972
Have you always been here?

00:39.974 --> 00:41.340
He was watching already.

00:55.790 --> 00:58.023
We are going to meet Will.

00:58.025 --> 01:03.829
And Will was very, very
nervous on the phone.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.831
Like almost
to the point of tears.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.766
-Yeah.
-Like, he's got this situation

01:07.768 --> 01:10.803
where he's so afraid
of what is in his attic

01:10.805 --> 01:12.771
<i>  that he completely</i>
<i>  sealed it off,</i>

01:12.773 --> 01:15.507
<i>  and he has not been up there</i>
<i>  in months.</i>

01:15.509 --> 01:16.608
Apparently,
there's a shoe in the attic.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.011
And he found that
right before sealing it off.

01:19.013 --> 01:22.081
And we were trying to get him
to send us pictures,
but he refused.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.849
He will not go into
that space.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.984
They've had tons of activity.

01:25.986 --> 01:26.852
They've had banging
on the wall.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.353
They've had shadow figures.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.021
So there's
a lot happening there.

01:30.023 --> 01:34.026
<i>  Enough to where they</i>
<i>  called in a psychic for help</i>
<i>  a couple of months ago.</i>

01:34.028 --> 01:35.160
<i>  And things</i>
<i>  have just gotten worse.</i>

01:35.162 --> 01:38.030
<i> [Adam] He's one of the</i>
<i>  most compelling clients</i>

01:38.032 --> 01:39.031
in terms of,

01:39.033 --> 01:42.734
"I am utterly afraid about
what is happening.

01:42.736 --> 01:46.839
And I feel my family
is in danger."

01:46.841 --> 01:50.008
<i>  It's very important</i>
<i>  that we give him solid,</i>
<i>  clear answers</i>

01:50.010 --> 01:52.644
<i>  that he can hold on to.</i>

01:52.646 --> 01:55.981
And hopefully help him through
whatever he's dealing with.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.092
-[Will] Hello.
-Hi. You must be Will.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.127
I am.
Welcome to my home.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.328
[Amy] Wow!

02:11.699 --> 02:13.031
[Adam] That's awesome.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.399
-Wow!
-[Amy] It's incredible.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.668
How old is this house?

02:16.670 --> 02:20.806
The house,
to the best of my knowledge,
was built in 1812. Um...

02:20.808 --> 02:23.609
My family, my father
and my stepmother,
and then now I own it.

02:23.611 --> 02:27.446
It's been in our family
for almost 35 years.

02:27.448 --> 02:31.383
Talking to you on the phone,
it sounded like
you really need some help.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.551
Yes.

02:32.553 --> 02:33.685
When did the activity start?

02:33.687 --> 02:37.055
I've had a rocking horse
I bought at a garage sale,

02:37.057 --> 02:40.325
and I feel that
there was like a little boy
who was attached to it.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.761
So where is that
rocking horse?

02:42.763 --> 02:45.931
It's behind that door there.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.600
-Oh, under the stairs.
-Yes, it's in there.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.801
[Amy] Oh, so it's locked away.

02:49.803 --> 02:50.903
Is there any way
you could get that...

02:50.905 --> 02:52.004
-Yes.
-...out for us?

02:52.006 --> 02:52.771
It just gonna take me
a minute.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.640
-It's buried.
-Okay.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.608
[Will] I don't know why
I've hung onto it for so long.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.076
I was unsure where
it was going to end up.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.912
And I didn't want it
to be that way.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.379
And that's why
I still have it.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.882
[Amy] So, you're kind of
protecting whoever is
associated with this.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.117
Yes, I absolutely am.

03:05.119 --> 03:06.385
Do you mind if
I set it on here?

03:06.387 --> 03:08.420
No, not at all.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.656
So, this you brought
into the house 10 years ago,
you said,

03:10.658 --> 03:12.257
or you just had it
10 years ago?

03:12.259 --> 03:15.027
I purchased it 10 years ago
at a garage sale.

03:15.029 --> 03:18.564
And, uh, that's when
I started seeing shadows,

03:18.566 --> 03:20.032
hearing noises.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.833
And, uh, I just called it
a little boy.

03:21.835 --> 03:22.801
Right.

03:22.803 --> 03:26.805
So we had a medium come in
two months ago.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.874
Okay, what was
the activity level like
after she left?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.409
It got worse.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.612
After the psychic came here
is when that loud knocking
started happening

03:33.614 --> 03:34.913
on the exterior wall

03:34.915 --> 03:35.981
where it would wake us up
in the middle of night.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.349
[Amy] Let's go up there.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.689
This here used to be
my dad's bedroom.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.090
[Amy] Okay.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.391
I just got really dizzy. Whoa.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.094
Mmm, you okay?

03:49.096 --> 03:51.597
Yeah.
I just got really dizzy.
Like, like blur though.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.998
Ooh.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.636
Like, weird. I'm fine,
but like just really weird.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.405
So my father spent
most of his time here.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.407
The psychic told me that
she saw my father in here.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.042
[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.778
And who told her that
he was not leaving me,
which I absolutely believe.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.713
I don't feel good
in this room.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.814
I need to get out of here.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.916
I don't know if
I'm just freaking myself out,

04:10.918 --> 04:11.917
but I need to
get out of this place.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.985
Okay.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.086
We'll follow you.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.222
This here,

04:17.224 --> 04:19.858
this is our younger
daughter Skylar's bedroom.

04:19.860 --> 04:20.892
Okay.

04:20.894 --> 04:21.860
How old is she?

04:21.862 --> 04:22.861
She's 11.

04:22.863 --> 04:23.795
My daughter was very close
to my father.

04:23.797 --> 04:24.730
-Oh, right.
-Very close.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.598
So when he passed,
it was that-- her--

04:26.600 --> 04:29.001
-It hit her really hard.
-It's devastating.

04:29.003 --> 04:31.670
but the problem--
the issue in here is
she hears little boys.

04:31.672 --> 04:32.738
[Amy] Mmm-hmm

04:32.740 --> 04:34.106
She hears
the knocking on the walls.

04:34.108 --> 04:34.973
[Amy] So this knocking,

04:34.975 --> 04:36.875
is it coming from up or the--

04:36.877 --> 04:38.143
I don't know if it's--

04:38.279 --> 04:39.344
[Amy] Oh, no!

04:39.913 --> 04:41.179
Yeah.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.716
I don't know if
it's the attic...

04:44.718 --> 04:45.817
[Amy] Mmm-hmm.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.286
-...or what. What the...
-[Adam] Yeah.

04:47.288 --> 04:48.787
But she sees something.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.755
Okay.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.924
And then the attic,
is it-- does it extend--

04:52.926 --> 04:53.859
It stops right there.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.594
-It stops right here?
-Right there.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.995
Okay, and it's just
that part of the house.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.665
Which leads me to,
when you go into my bedroom,

04:59.667 --> 05:01.366
there's other problems
with that, too.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.535
[Amy] Okay, we'll follow you.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.636
[Will] Okay.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.972
This is--
This is the master bedroom.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.407
Myself and my wife, obviously.

05:08.742 --> 05:09.907
Um...

05:10.044 --> 05:12.311
Over there in the wall,
I was sitting here working,

05:12.946 --> 05:15.614
and I heard a loud banging.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.715
"Boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom,"

05:16.717 --> 05:19.017
like someone's hitting my wall
with a hammer.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.552
-Yeah.
-And I'm like, "That's crazy."

05:20.554 --> 05:22.187
I look outside. I'm like,
"There's nobody on my roof."

05:22.189 --> 05:23.955
I'm like,
"You got to knock it off."

05:23.957 --> 05:24.723
Mmm-hmm.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.758
-It stopped.
-Wow. Okay.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.827
Why don't we head back down
into the kitchen area,

05:28.829 --> 05:30.162
and we'll discuss
our next steps.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.431
-[Will] Okay.
-All right.

05:33.867 --> 05:37.636
<i>  So far, we've heard about</i>
<i>  a little boy or children</i>
<i>  making themselves known</i>

05:37.638 --> 05:40.539
<i>  through a potentially</i>
<i>  haunted rocking toy.</i>

05:40.541 --> 05:44.376
<i>  Will also believes that</i>
<i>  his late father is present</i>
<i>  in spirit.</i>

05:44.378 --> 05:48.146
<i>  But we were called here</i>
<i>  about Will's fear</i>
<i>  of the attic,</i>

05:48.148 --> 05:52.250
<i>  which is a whole other thing,</i>
<i>  and something he's</i>
<i>  clearly trying to avoid.</i>

05:52.252 --> 05:54.853
Okay, so the psychic found
something in the attic, right?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.722
And they were talking about
something in the attic.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.623
[Will] We finished walking
through the house.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.959
-We found a couple of things
along the way.
<i>  -Right.</i>

06:00.961 --> 06:02.761
And the attic was
the most disturbing thing.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.562
Okay.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.029
[Will] She did not open it.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.966
She just went back downstairs,
went outside,
and said she got sick.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.035
I didn't mention that
I found the shoe in the attic.

06:10.037 --> 06:10.836
I was the only one
who knew that.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.037
-Okay.
-[Adam] Okay.

06:12.039 --> 06:16.174
So wait, you found the shoe,
sealed up the attic,

06:16.176 --> 06:18.910
and then a month later,
she came in
and felt something?

06:18.912 --> 06:19.845
-Yes.
<i>  -Okay.</i>

06:19.847 --> 06:20.912
-[Amy] All right.
-Yeah.

06:20.914 --> 06:24.049
You won't go up
to the attic though, right?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.784
If somebody
wants to go with me,
I'll go up there.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.919
But, it has been sealed.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.688
As long as you don't mind
reopening it.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.423
-That's fine.
-[Adam] Okay.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.191
-So, let's do that first.
-[Amy] So let's go
get that done.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.827
Let me find some, uh, tools.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.162
Okay.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.131
[Will] Nobody goes
in the attic.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.235
I call it
the stairway from hell.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.237
[Amy] So you're saying that

06:45.239 --> 06:48.073
it has not been opened
in how many months?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.041
-Three.
-Three months. Okay.

06:54.681 --> 06:55.947
Oh, I see.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.957
It's gotta go, it's gotta go.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.859
-[Adam] Ooh!
-[Amy] Ooh!

07:07.861 --> 07:11.863
[Will] Can you tell I made it
so nobody can get back in it?

07:11.865 --> 07:14.166
[Adam] All right so we're
gonna take it from--

07:14.168 --> 07:15.767
[Will] Oh! There's
the shoe right there.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.635
[Amy] Oh, it's right there.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.402
That's perfect.

07:17.404 --> 07:19.137
Here, can I take
a quick picture?

07:19.139 --> 07:20.005
[Will] That's all you.

07:20.007 --> 07:20.972
That is all you guys.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.441
-[Adam] Okay.
-[Amy] All right.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.009
[Amy] This is good.
Let me just--

07:24.011 --> 07:26.445
I'm gonna peek in, just--
I'm just gonna get
the shoe for now.

07:26.447 --> 07:27.645
Just take the door,

07:27.647 --> 07:28.913
and you can push
the bottom of the door
towards the wall.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.016
-It's fine.
-[Amy] Okay, so, we're just
gonna take pictures.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.717
We're not gonna take
the shoe out.
We're gonna leave it there.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.653
-[Adam] Yeah.
-Um...

07:34.655 --> 07:37.189
Whoever is up there,
we're not disturbing anything.

07:37.191 --> 07:40.058
We just want to make sure
we know whose shoe that is.

07:40.060 --> 07:44.329
We're gonna leave it there.
We're not gonna mess
with anything up there.

07:44.865 --> 07:45.864
Yeah, I'm getting jittery man.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.399
Can I please go downstairs?

07:47.401 --> 07:49.568
You absolutely--
You absolutely can.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.036
I just got this awful feeling.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.137
I feel like
I wanna cry right now.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.105
And I'm shaking for
no particular reason at all.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.408
-Okay.
-I just don't feel good.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.952
[exhales]

08:08.989 --> 08:12.691
So, um,
I didn't want to say it
in front of Will,

08:12.693 --> 08:15.093
um, but as soon as
this door opened,

08:15.095 --> 08:17.829
I started feeling
super panicky

08:17.831 --> 08:20.065
and I was not
expecting that at all.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.202
Yeah.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.977
Just pure sadness.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.412
As soon as we opened
this door,

08:34.414 --> 08:38.550
the energy in the space
changed completely.

08:38.552 --> 08:43.989
I mean, now that I'm--
Could it be Victorian era?
There's a heel on it.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.857
I have no idea
why I feel that way.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.292
Um...

08:49.263 --> 08:50.629
Now, you know why
I don't go in the attic.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.097
I mean...

08:52.099 --> 08:53.732
-I'm going to look
at that shoe for a second.
-Okay.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.667
That's why they're here
to help me out.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.068
-So...
-[producer] Okay.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.770
-We're good.
-All right. Thank you.

08:58.805 --> 08:59.938
[Will exhales]

09:00.674 --> 09:01.506
I feel like
we're going to find
something up here

09:01.508 --> 09:04.743
that is more than a shoe.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.245
-You know what I'm saying?
-Oh, [bleep], it's [bleep] as
[bleep] up there.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.847
-Yeah.
-I don't know what's up there.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.015
[bleep]

09:17.991 --> 09:19.858
[Amy] You knew we were going
to have to open that up.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.661
Okay, I hope
that wasn't a surprise.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.096
I just gotta get downstairs.
This is crazy.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.166
You definitely feel it
in there.

09:30.637 --> 09:33.338
Again, that's why
I got you guys here.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.806
So, I just want you to know
that like we--

09:34.808 --> 09:36.441
we know how concerned you are.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.910
We can tell and we will
do everything in our power

09:38.912 --> 09:41.880
to make this
a more comfortable space
for you and your family.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.783
And we're going to
just do what we do.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.585
And hopefully
get some answers for you.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.820
-Thank you so much.
-[Will] Thank you.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.256
-We're gonna get ready.
-Yeah, let's
get our stuff in here.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.933
[Amy] I just think
that the way

10:01.935 --> 10:03.702
Will was during
the walkthrough today

10:03.704 --> 10:06.204
and just how emotional
and upset he was,

10:06.206 --> 10:12.043
like, it's-- it makes me
feel like... this pressure

10:12.045 --> 10:14.646
that is not usually on us.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.181
You know what I mean?

10:16.183 --> 10:20.852
Yeah, the way he reacted
was alarming.

10:20.854 --> 10:21.586
Mmm-hmm.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.088
We have to figure it out.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.724
<i> [Amy] We're starting</i>
<i>  from the ground up.</i>

10:25.726 --> 10:26.891
<i>  We're heading</i>
<i>  into the living room</i>

10:26.893 --> 10:29.628
<i>  so we can kind of investigate</i>
<i>  the first floor,</i>

10:29.630 --> 10:33.498
<i>  but we're also going</i>
<i>  to pay attention</i>
<i> to that rocking fire truck toy</i>

10:33.500 --> 10:35.734
<i>  that Will brought home</i>
<i>  so many years ago.</i>

10:35.736 --> 10:38.970
<i>  He seems to think</i>
<i>  that there is a little boy</i>
<i>  attached to that.</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:41.239
And so we want to make sure
that we investigate that

10:41.241 --> 10:43.775
and see if we get any
evidence of that.

10:43.777 --> 10:48.680
I'm setting up the trigger
object proximity sensor
to this rocking chair.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.149
If anything gets in this,
like this,

10:51.685 --> 10:53.818
or moves it
or touch the side of it,

10:53.820 --> 10:55.253
it's going to go off.
I'm gonna grab...

10:55.255 --> 10:57.088
This is recording.

10:57.624 --> 10:58.990
[Amy] Okay.

11:00.727 --> 11:03.561
-Do you have the SOS?
-[Adam] Yeah, I do.

11:03.563 --> 11:06.197
-So this is going now.
-Thank you, sir.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.001
[Amy] So, if there's, um,
if there's a little boy

11:10.003 --> 11:13.838
or a little girl here
who wants to play,

11:13.840 --> 11:16.074
we brought
a toy out for you.

11:16.076 --> 11:19.044
This rocking fire truck.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.312
You can play with that.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.820
[Adam] Are there any kids here
that want to come play?

11:28.822 --> 11:31.089
I have a surprise for you.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.693
This teddy bear likes
to interact with you.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.896
If you touch BooBuddy,
he will talk to you.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.131
Come on downstairs
if you want to play.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.068
[BooBuddy laughs]

11:43.070 --> 11:45.003
[BooBuddy]
<i>  BooBuddy is ticklish!</i>

11:45.872 --> 11:47.572
I wasn't touching it.

11:47.574 --> 11:48.606
Yeah, it only says that
if something--

11:48.608 --> 11:50.075
[BooBuddy]
<i>  Did you say something?</i>

11:50.077 --> 11:51.976
-...touches it.
<i>  -Would you please</i>
<i>  say it again?</i>

11:57.584 --> 11:58.649
What's up?

11:58.752 --> 12:00.885
<i> [BooBuddy] Gee, I like</i>
<i>  holding hands with you.</i>

12:00.887 --> 12:01.720
-Is that touching it again?
-Yeah.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.653
It's the second time.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.160
[Amy] You can keep playing
with BooBuddy.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.895
I'm gonna see if
I can see you.

12:10.897 --> 12:11.663
Can you wave to me?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.198
Come on.

12:14.801 --> 12:18.737
It keeps detecting
an anomaly,
but it's not manifesting.

12:18.739 --> 12:19.704
Okay, now there's one.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.873
Oh, it's gone. Okay.

12:21.875 --> 12:28.313
There's a small anomaly
standing on top of the rocker.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.949
-On top of it?
-Yeah.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.862
[Amy] So, it's standing
on the table next to

12:43.864 --> 12:45.130
the rocker.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.398
I think I see you.
Can you wave to me like this?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.134
Can you lift up your arm?

12:49.770 --> 12:53.404
Now it's climbing,
trying to climb
into the rocker.

12:53.406 --> 12:57.275
It's literally standing
on the table right next to
the rocker.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.110
Okay, it's gone.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.946
I can show you.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.849
-Right there.
-Oh, yeah.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.252
-Oh, yeah!
-See how it's standing
right next to it?

13:07.254 --> 13:09.687
-[Adam] Uh-huh.
-And it's in front of it.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.890
-It's the size of a kid
and it's literally...
-It is, definitely.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.659
-Like, attached to this.
-...attached to this.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.394
It could be residual energy.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.763
I mean, it definitely could--

13:18.765 --> 13:20.732
-Didn't interact with us.
-[Amy] No.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.567
But that's also
just confirming
what we all knew.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.403
[Adam] We should, um,
go upstairs.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.073
Let's go to Skylar's room
and just make our way down
toward the attic.

13:29.776 --> 13:30.742
<i> [Amy] There's a presence here,</i>

13:30.744 --> 13:33.878
<i>  and it definitely seems</i>
<i>  to be a child.</i>

13:33.880 --> 13:37.415
<i>  But is this the same entity</i>
<i>  they're feeling</i>
<i>  on the second floor?</i>

13:37.417 --> 13:38.917
<i>  Or is that Will's Dad?</i>

13:38.919 --> 13:41.085
<i>  Or something else entirely?</i>

13:47.527 --> 13:51.563
Whoever has been
knocking on the walls,

13:51.565 --> 13:56.167
can you give us a loud knock
wherever you are in this room?

13:59.840 --> 14:03.074
Is there anyone in here
who visits Skylar?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.047
We know that Skylar
was very close

14:09.049 --> 14:13.952
to her grandfather, Robert.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.256
Robert, do you visit Skylar?

14:20.894 --> 14:23.995
[Amy] Will is very concerned
about this home.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.330
K2's going off.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.366
Is this a safe place to be?

14:32.539 --> 14:37.008
[Amy on recording]
<i>  Is there anyone in here</i>
<i>  who visits Skylar?</i>

14:37.010 --> 14:42.714
<i> [Adam] We know that Skylar</i>
<i>  was very close</i>
<i>  to her grandfather, Robert.</i>

14:42.716 --> 14:45.183
<i>  Robert, do you visit Skylar?</i>

14:46.019 --> 14:48.786
<i> [Amy] Will is very concerned</i>
<i>  about this home.</i>

14:48.788 --> 14:50.021
<i>  K2's going off.</i>

14:50.757 --> 14:52.390
<i>  Is this a safe place to be?</i>

14:55.629 --> 14:57.662
-Just very quiet.
-So weird.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.731
I'd like to open that
attic door

14:59.733 --> 15:03.268
and see what happens
in the rest of the house.
Like, let it out.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.871
Did you see the K2 going off
when I said that?

15:06.873 --> 15:08.006
Yeah.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.109
[Amy] Look at it.

15:14.381 --> 15:18.283
Got really active there
for a minute when were
talking about letting it out.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.721
Well, I guess we should try
that little experiment
and see what happens.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.690
[Adam] Yeah.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.292
There's something
weird up there, though.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.870
[Amy] It is [bleep] up there,

15:38.872 --> 15:41.105
and I was not
expecting that at all.

15:41.408 --> 15:42.907
[Adam] It's weird.

15:42.909 --> 15:45.043
[Amy] And leave the door open
while we do EVP work.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.111
[Adam] Yeah.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.014
I'll let that calibrate.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.253
All right, so...

15:55.889 --> 15:57.055
whoever...

15:58.191 --> 15:59.190
is in the attic,

15:59.192 --> 16:02.226
you're welcome to come out
and say hello to us.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.695
You're not in any trouble.

16:03.697 --> 16:07.398
We're not going to
ask you to leave,
we just want to talk.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.870
We would love to find out

16:12.872 --> 16:16.908
who is there, um,
who is in the attic

16:16.910 --> 16:19.844
that seems to really
be affecting Will.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.347
So can you please
tell us your name?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.384
Do you always stay
in the attic?

16:28.755 --> 16:31.055
If you do always stay
in the attic,

16:31.057 --> 16:35.193
would you rather
have the door open
or the door closed?

16:35.996 --> 16:38.129
Okay, let's play this.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.597
[Amy on recording]
<i>  All right, so...</i>

16:39.665 --> 16:41.232
<i>  whoever...</i>

16:41.234 --> 16:45.536
<i>  is in the attic,</i>
<i>  you're welcome to come out</i>
<i>  and say hello to us.</i>

16:45.538 --> 16:47.505
<i>  You're not in any trouble.</i>

16:47.507 --> 16:51.075
<i>  We're not going to</i>
<i>  ask you to leave,</i>
<i>  we just want to talk.</i>

16:51.611 --> 16:54.846
-[spirit speaking
on recording]
-"Talk."

16:54.848 --> 16:57.215
<i>  So can you please</i>
<i>  tell us your name?</i>

16:59.719 --> 17:02.687
<i>  Do you always stay</i>
<i>  in the attic?</i>

17:02.689 --> 17:05.056
<i> [Adam] If you do always</i>
<i>  stay in the attic,</i>

17:05.058 --> 17:08.593
<i>  would you rather</i>
<i>  have the door open</i>
<i>  or the door closed?</i>

17:08.595 --> 17:11.929
[garbled transmission]

17:11.931 --> 17:13.498
-Ooh, what was that?
-Does that sound like
something closed?

17:13.500 --> 17:16.000
<i>  If you do always stay</i>
<i>  in the attic,</i>

17:16.002 --> 17:19.337
<i>  would you rather</i>
<i>  have the door open</i>
<i>  or the door closed?</i>

17:22.075 --> 17:23.808
-"Leave it closed"?
-Yeah.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.410
"Leave it closed."

17:25.412 --> 17:26.544
Well, you know
what's interesting,

17:26.546 --> 17:28.513
we always talk about
how spirits
go to the place

17:28.515 --> 17:30.982
-where the least
amount of people are.
-Yeah.

17:30.984 --> 17:32.750
If you had pick one,
it's gonna be the attic,
because--

17:32.752 --> 17:34.118
-It's because of the seal.
-Right.

17:34.120 --> 17:38.189
I think, for now, we leave
the shoe and camera frame.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.427
Okay, that's great.

17:42.429 --> 17:46.064
So right now
we have taken the shoe
out of the attic.

17:46.066 --> 17:50.568
And we have put it right
in the frame
of our DVR camera.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.836
And we've closed
the attic door

17:51.838 --> 17:54.806
at the request of
the EVP that we got,

17:54.808 --> 17:57.775
and, um, we're just
going to leave that shoe there

17:57.777 --> 17:58.709
outside of the attic overnight

17:58.711 --> 18:00.411
and see what happens.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.912
<i>  You know,</i>
<i>  time is of the essence.</i>

18:01.914 --> 18:04.115
<i>  Like, yes, we have activity,</i>
<i>  which is great,</i>

18:04.117 --> 18:06.184
<i>  but there's nothing</i>
<i>  that has happened</i>
<i>  that will help us figure out</i>

18:06.186 --> 18:07.718
<i>  who is here.</i>

18:07.720 --> 18:10.488
<i>  Adam and I agree</i>
<i>  there is something scary</i>
<i>  about that attic.</i>

18:10.490 --> 18:14.192
<i>  But we don't know if</i>
<i>  it's the attic itself</i>
<i>  or what's in it?</i>

18:14.194 --> 18:17.528
<i>  We think it will really help</i>
<i>  to chat with Will's wife</i>
<i>  and daughters</i>

18:17.530 --> 18:21.699
<i>  to find out what kind of</i>
<i>  activity they are</i>
<i>  experiencing in the house.</i>

18:21.701 --> 18:24.802
How do you ladies feel
about like the attic?
For example.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.170
Does that creep you out?

18:26.172 --> 18:28.106
-Well, I've heard knocking
around the door.
-Okay.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.740
It feels off.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.109
-Mmm-hmm.
-Just so that...

18:31.111 --> 18:33.845
it's like it's slowly kind of
getting you...

18:33.847 --> 18:34.678
Mmm-hmm.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.713
...'cause it just feels
so different

18:35.715 --> 18:36.814
from the rest of the house.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.616
It just gives me like
an uncomfortable feeling.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.585
Like, I just don't want
to be near it.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.454
When did those feelings start
for the two of you?

18:43.456 --> 18:46.757
I think
it's always been like that,
at least for me personally.

18:46.759 --> 18:51.729
Like after my grandparent--
my grandpa passed, kind of,
grown a little more.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.931
None of you have been
in the attic ever?

18:53.933 --> 18:56.501
-No.
-No. I don't plan on it.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.568
You've been in the attic?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.871
No. And I don't plan on
going in the attic.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.606
Right and you have not
ever been in there?

19:01.608 --> 19:02.573
-[Amy] Why?
-No.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.642
It's not someplace
we wanna be.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.010
[Amy] Isn't it
so interesting though?

19:06.012 --> 19:08.813
It's interesting
but it's just... the vibe.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.715
Is it like that all the time
or is it--

19:10.717 --> 19:12.316
-All the time.
-All the time.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.820
Doesn't matter if I'm next
to three, four or five people,
it just feels bad.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.720
So, as long as
you can remember,

19:16.722 --> 19:19.423
you've had that feeling
about the attic.

19:19.425 --> 19:22.994
-Well, thank you so much,
ladies, we appreciate it.
-Thank you.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.663
<i> [Amy] It's clear everyone</i>
<i>  in this family</i>
<i>  fears the attic.</i>

19:25.665 --> 19:28.466
<i> The next step is to learn more</i>
<i>  about this house.</i>

19:28.468 --> 19:31.169
<i>  This is clearly</i>
<i>  a 200-year-old house.</i>

19:31.171 --> 19:34.038
<i>  We've been focusing a lot</i>
<i>  on the last 20 or 30 years,</i>

19:34.040 --> 19:37.275
<i>  but there are other families</i>
<i>  who lived here.</i>
<i>  There's a lot more history.</i>

19:37.577 --> 19:38.442
[bleep]

19:39.445 --> 19:42.413
[Adam] It's quiet
on this DVR, man.

19:42.415 --> 19:47.118
Unfortunately the Deeds Office
is not open to the public
because of the pandemic.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.319
They're not letting people in.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.389
But I was able to get them
on the phone

19:51.391 --> 19:54.926
and get some names of people
who were listed on deeds
in the house.

19:54.928 --> 19:56.127
Yeah.

19:56.129 --> 19:59.864
The guy only was able
to go back to like 1923.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.032
[Adam] Mmm-hmm.

20:01.034 --> 20:05.636
But what was interesting
is he's got a lot of McKowns,

20:05.638 --> 20:08.039
which is like
the last name McKown,

20:08.041 --> 20:10.975
which is a very big name
in town,

20:10.977 --> 20:12.677
like dating back to the 1700s.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.278
Okay.

20:14.280 --> 20:18.316
So, I would theorize that
they may have
even built this house

20:18.318 --> 20:24.288
because they were here
all the way through,
it looks like the '40s.

20:24.290 --> 20:27.725
But they were listed
on the deed way back
in 1923, as well.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.861
I know they're buried
in this Prospect Hill Cemetery
right up the street.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.863
Let's go to the cemetery.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.865
We can do some gravestone
etching, what do you think?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.267
[Adam] Yes.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.805
<i> [Amy] We're at the cemetery</i>
<i>  up the street.</i>

20:40.807 --> 20:42.840
<i>  We're looking</i>
<i>  for the McKown family.</i>

20:42.842 --> 20:45.509
<i>  Which through the research</i>
<i>  I've done,</i>
<i>  seems to be the family</i>

20:45.511 --> 20:48.179
<i>  that owned the house</i>
<i>  and built the house.</i>

20:49.282 --> 20:53.451
<i>  We just figured</i>
<i>  we'd come visit their</i>
<i> burial spot, do some etchings,</i>

20:53.453 --> 20:57.888
<i>  so we can bring that back</i>
<i>  to the house and use that</i>
<i>  as a trigger object</i>

20:57.890 --> 21:01.125
<i>  and see if that gets</i>
<i> any activity later on tonight.</i>

21:01.127 --> 21:02.994
Absalom...

21:02.996 --> 21:06.430
This is probably the person
who built the house
right here and his wife.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.432
So, we definitely want that.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.402
Because it could very well
be his shoe in the attic.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.073
[Adam] It's sort of like
when you do this,
it sort of feels like

21:16.075 --> 21:17.441
you're bringing them to life.

21:18.711 --> 21:19.477
Thank you, McKown family.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.811
[Amy] Thanks, McKowns.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.046
[Adam] Listen,
if any of you
are listening to us,

21:22.048 --> 21:22.880
you want to come back to

21:22.882 --> 21:24.415
where you used to live...

21:25.885 --> 21:27.184
to chat with us,
that would be great.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.623
<i> We need to get into that attic</i>
<i>  to see if what we know now</i>

21:32.625 --> 21:35.993
<i>  will lead to any activity</i>
<i>  or insight into</i>
<i>  what's going on here.</i>

21:36.162 --> 21:38.162
I'm going to leave
the shoe here.

21:40.033 --> 21:43.868
<i>  Hopefully a spirit box</i>
<i>  session will reveal if anyone</i>
<i>  from the McKown family</i>

21:43.870 --> 21:45.102
<i>  is behind all this.</i>

21:50.610 --> 21:52.043
Okay, we're good.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.147
My name is Amy
and this is my friend,
Adam.

21:56.616 --> 21:59.350
And he can hear you right now,

21:59.686 --> 22:02.720
even though
I might not be able to.

22:02.722 --> 22:06.824
So I need you to answer
every question
that I pose to you.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.760
I'm sorry if we are invading
your space,
but we need answers

22:09.762 --> 22:12.096
for the family
who lives here now.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.233
So do you know
who lives here now?

22:20.606 --> 22:23.240
Are you a McKown
family member?

22:25.978 --> 22:30.314
I know Francis was here
a long time ago,
what about Francis?

22:34.854 --> 22:36.354
Now I know Francis'...

22:37.957 --> 22:40.157
father was Absalom.

22:41.761 --> 22:42.960
"I am."

22:42.962 --> 22:44.095
[Amy] You're Absalom?

22:45.398 --> 22:46.997
"Get out."

22:56.843 --> 23:00.945
We went to the cemetery today
and visited
the McKown family plot.

23:00.947 --> 23:04.815
Do you know Absalom?
That would be the person
who built this house.

23:04.817 --> 23:05.983
It was Absalom.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.052
"He was my husband."

23:08.054 --> 23:11.922
Oh, Edith. Absalom's wife.

23:11.924 --> 23:12.923
Edith, was it Edith?

23:12.925 --> 23:14.558
"Anxious."

23:14.560 --> 23:16.994
Yeah, everyone
feels anxious up here.

23:18.131 --> 23:20.331
So, Edith,
did you leave the shoe here?

23:20.433 --> 23:22.199
"What do you want?"

23:22.201 --> 23:26.370
Well, we're trying
to make sure that the family
who is here is safe.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.406
"I'm fine."

23:28.408 --> 23:31.942
I understand that you're fine,
but there is
a living family here.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.344
They don't know who you are.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.580
"Everyone's afraid."

23:36.582 --> 23:38.649
They are, they're all afraid.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.117
We'd like to make them
not afraid.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.319
Do they have anything to fear
from you?

23:45.224 --> 23:47.224
Oh, I can't reach him.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.761
[Amy laughs]

23:50.763 --> 23:52.963
-I couldn't reach you, sorry.
-Good Lord, okay.

23:52.965 --> 23:53.864
Is that a female speaking?

23:53.866 --> 23:54.898
Yeah.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.867
Okay like that was actually
really helpful.

23:56.869 --> 23:59.570
I know that was short
but it was literally like
just to the point.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.739
-Really?
-Yes.

24:01.741 --> 24:05.142
-I think we're
talking to Edith McKown...
-Okay.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.678
...who is the wife
of the gentleman
who I think

24:07.680 --> 24:09.547
built this house.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.749
I mean, maybe moving the shoe
was enough
to kind of disturb them,

24:11.751 --> 24:15.085
but like they're like,
"Get out of this attic."

24:15.087 --> 24:17.555
It was very matter of fact.
It has nothing to do
with the family.

24:17.557 --> 24:20.724
It's like this is what it--
Yeah, that's the way it felt.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.760
I mean, that's great for that
to be popped like that.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.361
-It was like instant.
-Yeah.

24:26.098 --> 24:29.433
Thankfully, we got a really
spot-on spirit box session

24:29.435 --> 24:31.135
while we were up there.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.437
<i>  It was pretty clear</i>
<i>  that we were dealing</i>
<i>  with someone who is a member</i>

24:33.439 --> 24:34.672
<i>  of the McKown family.</i>

24:34.740 --> 24:37.875
<i>  They were very responsive</i>
<i>  when we brought up the shoe.</i>

24:37.877 --> 24:41.178
<i>  So I think the attic</i>
<i>  is all about that shoe.</i>

24:44.016 --> 24:45.583
<i>  Now is a great time</i>
<i>  to bring Chip in</i>

24:45.585 --> 24:48.118
<i>  and see if he can</i>
<i>  confirm our suspicions.</i>

24:48.120 --> 24:50.754
<i>  Hey, Chip, all right,</i>
<i>  so let's flip you around</i>

24:50.756 --> 24:53.357
<i>  so you can see</i>
<i>  where we are. Um...</i>

24:54.093 --> 24:56.794
And let me know if you
pick up on anything.

24:56.796 --> 24:59.263
It really feels like that...

25:00.533 --> 25:02.833
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:02.835 --> 25:06.770
<i>  Yeah, I'm feeling creepy</i>
<i>  by that.</i>

25:06.772 --> 25:08.939
But there's just a--
there's just kind of a...

25:09.108 --> 25:11.942
a funky vibe in this room.

25:11.944 --> 25:12.676
<i>  You feel uncomfortable?</i>

25:12.678 --> 25:13.711
Okay.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.379
<i>  -Um, take me upstairs.</i>
<i> -Okay.</i>

25:19.018 --> 25:21.385
<i>  Who's the man whose name</i>
<i>  starts with an "R".</i>

25:22.455 --> 25:25.823
Richard, Ronald,
Roger, Robert.

25:25.825 --> 25:32.196
We know that Skylar
was very close
to her grandfather, Robert.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.032
Robert, do you visit Skylar?

25:36.035 --> 25:37.968
It would be his father.

25:39.939 --> 25:43.774
We have gotten zero evidence

25:43.776 --> 25:47.778
that his family
is in this space.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.180
<i>  Dad is with others</i>
<i>  in spirit,</i>

25:50.182 --> 25:52.750
<i>  he is in a good safe,</i>
<i>  secure place.</i>

25:52.752 --> 25:53.984
<i>  Dad is fine.</i>

25:53.986 --> 25:56.253
<i>  He is worried about his son.</i>

25:56.455 --> 25:57.821
-[Amy] Okay.
-Yeah.

25:58.024 --> 26:01.825
There's a family unit
that lives in this house
is what I'm getting.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.093
And there's a-- there's--

26:03.095 --> 26:07.798
<i>  there's different levels</i>
<i>  of infestation that go on,</i>

26:07.800 --> 26:14.905
<i>  and it feels like</i>
<i>  there's an oppressive feel</i>
<i>  to this house,</i>

26:14.907 --> 26:18.042
<i>  that something is kind of</i>
<i>  making its way down.</i>

26:18.744 --> 26:19.944
Is there another level?

26:19.946 --> 26:21.111
<i> [Adam] So there is.</i>

26:27.053 --> 26:28.986
What the what?

26:31.891 --> 26:33.424
Oh, I just don't
like this place.

26:35.895 --> 26:36.427
And then, um...

26:38.064 --> 26:39.196
Here.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.164
<i>  You see this?</i>

26:40.166 --> 26:41.332
What?

26:49.609 --> 26:51.075
That's [bleep] up.

27:01.053 --> 27:04.521
It's like incredible
intense something

27:04.523 --> 27:07.424
<i>  on that object.</i>

27:07.426 --> 27:09.760
It feels like it's been there
for a long amount of time.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.795
<i> [Adam] Yeah.</i>

27:11.797 --> 27:14.732
<i>  There's a man who lives there</i>
<i>  and it's the turtle figure,</i>

27:14.734 --> 27:15.966
<i>  the father figure.</i>

27:15.968 --> 27:19.236
It feels like he is
freaked the [bleep] out
by this.

27:19.739 --> 27:20.771
-[Adam] Okay.
-Okay.

27:20.773 --> 27:22.773
All right, Chip,
thank you so much.

27:22.775 --> 27:25.542
-Thank you,
we'll talk to you soon.
-We'll talk to you soon.

27:25.544 --> 27:27.611
Well, I mean,
the really cool thing is

27:27.613 --> 27:29.546
I guess he picked up
on the "R" name, Robert.

27:29.548 --> 27:32.950
Yeah, he picked up obviously
on the attic and the shoe.

27:32.952 --> 27:35.786
But I did find out
some interesting stuff
I wanted to share with you.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.153
[Adam] Okay, great.

27:37.523 --> 27:40.391
<i> [Amy] We have found</i>
<i>  shoes in walls</i>
<i>  of old buildings before</i>

27:40.393 --> 27:43.994
<i>  and I was able</i>
<i>  to actually dig up</i>
<i>  some information</i>

27:43.996 --> 27:48.832
<i>  on why this happened,</i>
<i>  especially in the, you know,</i>
<i>  late 1700s, early 1800s.</i>

27:48.834 --> 27:52.102
A lot of older New England
homes have them

27:52.104 --> 27:53.837
and the thought process
behind it

27:53.839 --> 27:58.042
was they would leave like
well-worn shoes in walls,

27:58.110 --> 28:00.177
the idea being it would--

28:00.179 --> 28:02.413
it would dispel evil spirits,

28:02.415 --> 28:04.214
or the spirits
would be tricked

28:04.216 --> 28:07.017
and go look
for the shoe instead
of the person.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.052
Yeah.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.621
So, that could make sense why

28:10.623 --> 28:13.924
an entity or an energy
would be around those shoes

28:13.926 --> 28:16.760
and be defensive of them
being removed.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.429
Yeah, because
you're touching the shoes.

28:18.431 --> 28:20.831
You're touching the shoes
that are here
to protect the house.

28:20.833 --> 28:25.769
Yeah, exactly.
So the house is built in 1812,
so if the shoe predates 1812--

28:25.771 --> 28:28.172
It's, yeah, it would
probably be associated

28:28.174 --> 28:29.039
with whoever built the home.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.841
Exactly.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.943
Let me see if I can get
the shoe museum
on the phone here.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.144
Okay.

28:34.647 --> 28:37.715
[Adam] Thank you for
taking the time
to talk with us.

28:37.717 --> 28:40.617
We wanted some information
on an old shoe,

28:40.619 --> 28:41.885
so I'm going
to show it to you.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.421
[Amy] And you can just tell us
like whatever you need to see.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.023
However, you need us
to present it.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.591
[Adam] They found it
in the attic.

28:47.626 --> 28:50.527
<i>  So looking at that shoe,</i>

28:50.529 --> 28:54.398
<i>  I would have to predict</i>
<i>  you're looking at somebody</i>
<i>  in the 18th century.</i>

28:54.400 --> 28:57.034
-Yeah.
<i>  -And it just looks like</i>
<i>  a Puritan shoe.</i>

28:57.036 --> 29:00.804
<i>  You know, I would think that</i>
<i>  that shoe has to be at least</i>
<i>  from the 1700s.</i>

29:00.806 --> 29:02.106
[Amy] Okay, yeah.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.608
So that totally makes sense.
That's super helpful.

29:04.610 --> 29:05.909
[Adam] Well, thank you!

29:05.911 --> 29:07.177
Yeah, I appreciate
your time for sure.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.879
-Thank you so much, Sir.
-[Amy] Thank you so much
for your help.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.748
-That's awesome.
-Yeah, 1700s.

29:10.750 --> 29:11.949
Then, we should
investigate more of the shoe.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.984
Yeah, let's do that for sure.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.886
-Okay.
-All right, let's get ready.

29:15.888 --> 29:19.890
<i> [Adam] The fact</i>
<i>  that Mark dated the shoe</i>
<i>  to that time period is huge.</i>

29:19.892 --> 29:21.992
<i>  According to</i>
<i>  Absalom's headstone,</i>

29:21.994 --> 29:23.494
<i>  he was born in 1786.</i>

29:23.496 --> 29:26.263
<i>  So it very well</i>
<i>  could be his shoe.</i>

29:26.265 --> 29:28.098
<i>  I'm curious to see</i>
<i>  what will happen</i>
<i>  if we take the shoe,</i>

29:28.100 --> 29:30.534
<i>  not just out of the attic,</i>
<i>  but out of the house.</i>

29:30.536 --> 29:35.305
<i>  We are removing the shoe</i>
<i> and taking it to the graveside</i>
<i>  of Absalom and his family.</i>

29:35.307 --> 29:38.842
<i>  We're going to see</i>
<i>  if we can make</i>
<i>  some sort of connection</i>

29:38.844 --> 29:42.246
<i>  to his family or just see</i>
<i>  if something is really</i>
<i>  attached to this shoe.</i>

29:49.021 --> 29:49.820
[Amy] All right.

29:49.822 --> 29:50.954
[Adam] Now if anyone--
Here,

29:50.956 --> 29:52.790
let me get the trigger
object proximity sensor out.

29:52.792 --> 29:57.628
I mean we rarely
investigate cemeteries,
but because we have something

29:57.630 --> 30:00.931
that belonged to the family,
it seems appropriate.

30:00.933 --> 30:01.965
-[Amy] We could try it.
-Yeah.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.233
I'm gonna be very careful.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.337
Mr. McKown,

30:07.673 --> 30:11.909
we brought this shoe
from your house we believe.

30:11.911 --> 30:16.113
Can you tell us
what your name is please?
So we can confirm it's you.

30:16.916 --> 30:21.418
Did you put this shoe
in the attic of a house?

30:24.123 --> 30:25.956
Is the house safe?

30:27.827 --> 30:29.192
Okay, let's listen to it.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.697
[Amy on recording]
<i>  Can you tell us</i>
<i>  what your name is please?</i>

30:33.699 --> 30:34.698
<i>  So we can confirm it's you.</i>

30:34.700 --> 30:35.999
[garbled transmission]

30:36.001 --> 30:38.902
-Oh, did that say Absalom?
-That did not say Absalom!

30:38.904 --> 30:40.103
-Did it say that?
-It said Absalom.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.471
Absalom.

30:49.748 --> 30:52.015
[Amy on recording]
<i>  Can you tell us</i>
<i>  what your name is please?</i>

30:52.017 --> 30:53.884
<i>  So we can confirm it's you.</i>

30:53.886 --> 30:54.918
[spirit on recording]

30:54.920 --> 30:56.053
Absalom.

30:56.088 --> 30:56.854
It's really fast.

30:56.856 --> 30:57.988
-Absalom.
-Absalom.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.990
<i> [Adam] ...in the attic</i>
<i>  of a house?</i>

31:01.861 --> 31:03.026
<i> [Amy] Is the house safe?</i>

31:03.028 --> 31:04.361
[garbled transmission]

31:06.765 --> 31:08.198
-That is--
-Play it again.

31:08.934 --> 31:10.167
<i> [Amy] Is the house safe?</i>

31:10.169 --> 31:10.734
[spirit on recording]

31:10.736 --> 31:13.103
-No.
-No.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.504
-We have to put the shoe back.
-We got to take the shoe back.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.774
I think that,

31:17.776 --> 31:21.044
the energy surrounding it
thinks the house is not safe
because it's not in the house.

31:21.046 --> 31:21.712
Right, exactly.

31:21.714 --> 31:22.779
Oh, my God.

31:22.781 --> 31:24.848
-[Amy] I did not expect that.
-Me neither.

31:24.850 --> 31:25.515
[Amy] I really did not
expect that.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.716
[Adam] I'm sorry, Absalom.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.086
-We're taking the shoe back.
-We're taking the shoe back.

31:29.088 --> 31:32.789
-Is the wind just suddenly
going crazy?
-Yeah, that's a horror movie.

31:32.791 --> 31:33.891
Let's go ahead and...

31:33.893 --> 31:35.626
[Adam]
We gotta get this back.
That's so crazy.

31:35.628 --> 31:37.728
[Amy] Yeah, we do need
to get it back.

31:37.730 --> 31:41.131
<i> [Adam] We have a lot more</i>
<i>  we want to ask, but one thing</i>
<i>  we know for sure,</i>

31:41.700 --> 31:43.367
<i> the shoe belongs in the house.</i>

31:44.870 --> 31:46.536
<i> [Amy] So right now</i>
<i>  we're splitting up.</i>

31:46.538 --> 31:49.840
<i>  I'm going to head upstairs</i>
<i>  to the attic and I'm going</i>
<i>  to sit next to the shoe</i>

31:49.842 --> 31:51.675
<i>  and have</i>
<i>  the spirit box running.</i>

31:51.677 --> 31:54.745
<i>  Adam's going to ask questions</i>
<i>  through the walkie.</i>

31:54.747 --> 31:57.180
<i>  Whatever I hear,</i>
<i>  I will say</i>
<i>  and Adam will hear it</i>

31:57.182 --> 31:59.149
<i>  from downstairs with the IFB.</i>

31:59.852 --> 32:01.051
Walkie check.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.086
Good, check. Good, check.

32:03.889 --> 32:05.956
<i> [Amy] Right, now I'm going</i>
<i>  to go under.</i>

32:13.599 --> 32:15.365
Whoever's up there
with my friend, Amy.

32:16.869 --> 32:19.636
I have a few questions
that I want to ask.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.204
<i>  We're trying to contact</i>

32:21.974 --> 32:24.274
the family
who built this house.

32:25.177 --> 32:26.376
It was my dad.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.246
Okay.

32:30.983 --> 32:34.251
Is-- um...
Is this the McKowns?

32:34.920 --> 32:36.420
<i>  What about Absalom McKown?</i>

32:38.157 --> 32:39.289
All of us.

32:42.594 --> 32:43.961
Trouble.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.397
Yeah, is that why the shoe
was in the attic?

32:49.868 --> 32:51.134
The evil's in.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.238
There's more coming.

32:55.841 --> 32:58.342
Who put the shoe in the attic,
why is it there?

33:00.112 --> 33:03.280
Somebody told us
that the shoe is there
for protection.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.248
He's coming.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.350
<i>  Who's coming?</i>

33:07.720 --> 33:09.419
Oh, no.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.188
Who's coming?
Who are you talking about?

33:11.190 --> 33:12.255
A thousand.

33:13.792 --> 33:14.424
Get ready.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.259
They're coming.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.263
Footsteps.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.166
That's scary [bleep].

33:28.407 --> 33:29.439
<i>  Should we be afraid?</i>

33:29.575 --> 33:31.375
I'll help him.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.315
<i> [Adam] There seems like</i>
<i>  to be multiple people</i>
<i>  trying to talk at once.</i>

33:38.817 --> 33:40.951
It all makes sense.

33:43.655 --> 33:46.790
Can someone
just introduce themselves?
I don't know.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.860
There's too many people
talking right now.
I can't figure it out.

33:49.862 --> 33:51.361
Probably wouldn't care.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.966
I do actually care a lot.

33:55.968 --> 33:58.235
Are all the people talking,
are you connected to

33:59.004 --> 34:01.405
the intention behind
the shoe in the attic?

34:01.940 --> 34:03.040
<i>  Is that true?</i>

34:04.143 --> 34:05.242
They let me in.

34:06.912 --> 34:07.877
Who let you in?

34:10.783 --> 34:12.349
Are you connected
to Will and his family?

34:12.351 --> 34:13.984
Are you related to them?

34:15.521 --> 34:19.189
<i>  -Are you protecting--</i>
<i> -Never. That was like</i>
<i> a little kid.</i>

34:19.191 --> 34:21.425
<i>  Are you protecting</i>
<i>  Will and his family?</i>

34:23.829 --> 34:24.428
It's them.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.064
It's all gone.

34:27.066 --> 34:28.331
<i>  So you're protecting them?</i>

34:29.802 --> 34:31.068
All of them.

34:32.805 --> 34:33.837
They depend on me.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.373
You know, it's sort of--
it sort of seems like...

34:37.309 --> 34:39.309
I don't know why
I'm getting this feeling.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.981
<i>  Have all of you lived</i>
<i>  in this house</i>
<i>  at one point or another?</i>

34:45.350 --> 34:46.583
At one point, what?

34:56.095 --> 34:59.062
Have all of you,
all of you,
did you all live in this house

34:59.064 --> 35:00.230
at one time or another?

35:01.066 --> 35:02.065
Leaving.

35:03.135 --> 35:04.201
You.

35:04.837 --> 35:06.103
Let me go.

35:09.842 --> 35:11.141
Anything else
you'd like to say?

35:11.977 --> 35:14.144
Now let's go.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.247
Go back, it's okay.
You can relax.

35:17.883 --> 35:19.015
Leaving.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.383
Andy, if you want to stop her.

35:23.122 --> 35:23.954
<i> [Adam] You're good Amy.</i>

35:23.956 --> 35:25.355
-I'm good?
<i>  -Yeah, you're good.</i>

35:27.226 --> 35:29.960
<i>  That was weird--</i>
<i>  I have a weird thing</i>
<i>  to share with you.</i>

35:29.962 --> 35:32.929
<i>  I don't even know</i>
<i>  if it's possible,</i>

35:32.931 --> 35:34.097
so if you want to come down.

35:35.134 --> 35:36.032
[Amy] All right.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.140
What the [bleep]
happened there?
'Cause--

35:43.142 --> 35:44.875
Okay. What did you
think was happening?

35:44.877 --> 35:46.109
I felt like

35:46.445 --> 35:47.811
all these different voices,

35:47.813 --> 35:52.282
but it was kind of like
I would hear like
weird scary sounds.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.886
It just sounded
kind of desperate.
I don't know.

35:55.888 --> 35:56.453
-It was weird.
-Yeah.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.654
I was very mixed up.

35:57.656 --> 36:02.993
What it sounded like to me is
we-- you were communicating

36:02.995 --> 36:07.063
all of the things that
that shoe has ever absorbed

36:07.232 --> 36:08.832
in the 200 years...

36:08.834 --> 36:09.599
Weird.

36:09.601 --> 36:10.800
...that it's been
in this house.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.769
Because it was--
I'm getting chills
thinking about it.

36:12.771 --> 36:17.407
Like, it just felt as if these
were moments and blips in time

36:17.409 --> 36:23.947
where people were afraid
or fearful or confused
or angry or mad,

36:23.949 --> 36:25.982
and it was just popping out.

36:25.984 --> 36:28.652
It makes sense.
What I feel like is

36:28.654 --> 36:30.019
they gave it a mission.

36:30.021 --> 36:34.958
They gave that shoe
a mission to deflect evil,
deflect badness...

36:34.960 --> 36:36.893
-And it's still doing it.
-...and it's still doing it.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.462
It's just taking
all of that in.

36:39.464 --> 36:41.665
Yeah, that's
what it felt like to me.

36:41.667 --> 36:45.035
I mean, my inclination is
to just leave it in the attic

36:45.037 --> 36:46.937
and let it continue
doing its job.

36:46.939 --> 36:54.377
And so, what if we asked Will
to do his own intention
with his own shoe

36:54.379 --> 36:57.147
-for his family, specifically?
-Right.

36:57.149 --> 37:00.383
And put them together,
then it sort of will
work in tandem

37:00.385 --> 37:01.418
and he will
have control over it.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.652
-Yeah.
-Right?

37:02.654 --> 37:06.523
I think we can take
the fear away from it
for him that way.

37:06.525 --> 37:10.360
Let's get our stuff together
and we have a lot to tell him
for sure.

37:11.463 --> 37:15.765
<i> [Amy] This shoe became</i>
<i>  this kind of beacon</i>
<i>  for the bad stuff.</i>

37:15.767 --> 37:18.868
Like that's what its job was.
Is the bad stuff
heads to the shoe,

37:18.870 --> 37:20.337
<i>  and then it's gone.</i>

37:22.608 --> 37:23.807
<i>  We'll see how Will takes it.</i>

37:23.809 --> 37:26.876
It's really just about him
redirecting his fear

37:26.878 --> 37:30.280
and just really
realizing that, you know,

37:30.282 --> 37:32.515
what's happening in this house
isn't scary.

37:32.517 --> 37:36.620
<i>  His girls need him.</i>
<i>  His family needs him.</i>
<i>  They need him confident.</i>

37:36.622 --> 37:40.223
<i>  And if he feels safe,</i>
<i>  the rest of them</i>
<i>  will feel safe and secure.</i>

37:42.594 --> 37:46.596
This has been a very
interesting case for us.
And I think

37:46.598 --> 37:49.933
we have some news for you
that could really change

37:49.935 --> 37:52.535
the way you do things
around here.

37:52.537 --> 37:53.870
I mean, to put it bluntly,

37:53.872 --> 37:57.007
we encountered something that
we had never seen before.

37:57.009 --> 37:58.775
And we have answers for you.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.911
We spent three days
in your house

38:01.913 --> 38:05.582
trying to reach out
specifically to those
who you thought

38:05.584 --> 38:07.617
were in the house.

38:07.619 --> 38:11.521
Like your father.
We did not come across them
in the house at all.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.423
-Not even my father?
-Not even.

38:13.425 --> 38:17.694
So what we did do is
we consulted Chip
about your family.

38:17.696 --> 38:20.630
We watched your copy,
and he immediately picked up

38:20.632 --> 38:24.267
your dad is with others
in spirit,
that he's doing all right.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.605
But he's not causing
any activity in your house.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.073
[crying] Okay.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.277
But now, let's figure out
what's going on in your house.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.012
Fair enough.

38:36.014 --> 38:38.715
So we did delve very much
into the history of the home.

38:38.717 --> 38:42.652
We were able to basically
kind of trace it back
to Absalom McKown,

38:42.654 --> 38:46.323
who we think most likely
built this home in 1812.

38:46.325 --> 38:47.924
I don't know if
you're familiar with this,

38:47.926 --> 38:51.394
but some of
these early settlers,
they were very superstitious.

38:51.396 --> 38:54.898
They believed putting shoes in
the walls or in the attics

38:54.900 --> 38:57.734
was a way
to ward off evil spirits.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.103
-It was a way
to protect a home.
-Yeah.

39:00.105 --> 39:01.404
-That's pretty cool.
-Yeah.

39:01.406 --> 39:03.707
So we were doing
the spirit box experiment

39:03.709 --> 39:05.508
inside the attic
with the shoe.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.778
It was as if they were
little vignettes or snapshots

39:08.780 --> 39:14.417
of 200 years of deflecting
and absorbing the bad stuff

39:14.419 --> 39:16.853
that could have happened
in this house.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.956
It's almost sounds like
the shoe's actually doing
what it was put there for.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.057
[Amy] Exactly,

39:21.059 --> 39:23.560
so that shoe
has been doing its job
for 200 years.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.662
-Yeah.
-And now it's back
in the attic.

39:25.664 --> 39:28.865
I mean, how do you feel now?
How do you feel?

39:28.867 --> 39:32.969
Um, I feel 100% better
knowing nobody's
gonna hurt my family.

39:33.872 --> 39:34.671
[Adam] Yeah.

39:34.673 --> 39:35.672
It feels lighter in here.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.640
It feels airier.
I will tell you that.

39:37.642 --> 39:40.410
Um, it doesn't feel
the same as the other day.

39:40.412 --> 39:41.611
It definitely feels
100% better.

39:41.613 --> 39:43.546
Knowing what it's there for,

39:43.548 --> 39:46.616
I promise you,
that thing is going to be
a shrine in this house.

39:46.618 --> 39:49.619
[Amy] Well, we have
a plan for you
that we think will work.

39:49.621 --> 39:53.757
The start of the plan was
to get your, you know,
thoughts on the shoe,

39:53.759 --> 39:55.725
because the shoe's been here
the whole time.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.627
[Amy] It's been in the room
with us this whole time.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.729
-[Adam] And it's not,
I mean, you know...
-Okay.

39:59.731 --> 40:04.534
This shoe is protecting
and doing exactly what it is.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.736
And now that you know,
it's like--

40:06.738 --> 40:08.671
For instance,
the way you felt about
the shoe the other day,

40:08.673 --> 40:09.973
and you were in the room.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.775
I wouldn't be able to
sit next to this thing
right now.

40:11.777 --> 40:18.014
Exactly, and what
we would like to do is
take this a step further.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.784
-You are going
to put the shoe back...
-It belongs there.

40:20.786 --> 40:25.755
But what we would love
for you to do is
to take one of your shoes

40:25.757 --> 40:30.727
and put your own intention
of protection and energy
into that

40:30.729 --> 40:32.862
and put it with this shoe
and it will like...

40:32.864 --> 40:34.831
it'll-- double protection.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.466
That works.
I'm okay with that.
Absolutely.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.234
Absolutely.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.706
<i> [Amy] You know, we all have</i>
<i>  those moments where</i>
<i>  we misinterpret something,</i>

40:43.708 --> 40:45.875
<i>  and I think that</i>
<i>  paranormal activity</i>

40:45.877 --> 40:48.545
<i>  is probably</i>
<i>  one of the easiest things</i>
<i>  to misinterpret,</i>

40:48.547 --> 40:50.280
<i> and that makes complete sense.</i>

40:50.916 --> 40:53.483
<i>  We have this innate fear</i>
<i>  of the unknown,</i>

40:53.485 --> 40:55.718
<i>  and so sometimes</i>
<i>  we come into a place</i>

40:55.720 --> 40:58.988
<i>  and we just kind of have to</i>
<i>  gently remind people</i>

40:58.990 --> 41:01.424
<i>  that that energy is</i>
<i>  very human in nature.</i>

41:01.426 --> 41:04.694
<i>  And once you realize</i>
<i>  what its intentions are</i>
<i>  and why it's there,</i>

41:04.696 --> 41:06.396
<i>  it becomes a lot less scary.</i>

41:07.199 --> 41:09.098
I give you something old.

41:11.102 --> 41:13.002
And I give you something new.

41:16.675 --> 41:19.108
Look out after us
as I will do to you.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.180
Thank you,
thank you very much.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.282
-That's good.
-Perfect.

41:29.221 --> 41:30.053
[Adam] Excellent.

41:30.055 --> 41:31.321
And done.

41:32.591 --> 41:33.723
Doesn't it feel so different?

41:33.725 --> 41:36.726
-It's not as heavy.
-Not at all.

41:36.728 --> 41:39.963
And now those shoes
will do the work
they're supposed to do.

41:39.965 --> 41:43.867
<i> [Amy] You know,</i>
<i>  we went from day one</i>
<i>  with that moment of</i>

41:43.869 --> 41:46.603
<i>  not even being able</i>
<i>  to hardly open the attic door</i>

41:46.605 --> 41:48.671
to Will just leaning in
that attic

41:48.673 --> 41:50.707
and putting his shoe
and the other shoe back

41:50.709 --> 41:52.542
and turning around
and smiling.

41:52.544 --> 41:54.344
Like, it was just
a complete 180.

41:54.346 --> 41:56.346
<i>  And I think that</i>
<i>  what we did here</i>

41:56.348 --> 42:00.049
<i>  was probably one of</i>
<i>  the most rewarding cases</i>
<i>  we've ever done.</i>
