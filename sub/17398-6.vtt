00:11.720 --> 00:16.359
Tonight, James asks a girl
for a favour. No.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.919
Richard listens to a man.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.440
And I polish a bishop.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.999
Hello, good evening!

00:31.000 --> 00:34.719
Hello, thank you, everybody,
thank you. Now.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.679
New cars come out so fast
these days,

00:37.680 --> 00:40.759
sometimes it is difficult
to keep up.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.279
Nissan, for example, said the other
day that over the next six years,

00:44.280 --> 00:47.719
they will be bringing out
a new model every six weeks.

00:47.720 --> 00:50.919
Happily, however,
there are some car companies,

00:50.920 --> 00:53.839
usually Italian ones,
that won't be rushed.

00:53.840 --> 00:57.279
That like to take their time,
have some lunch.

00:57.280 --> 01:00.519
And nobody is better at this
than Lamborghini,

01:00.520 --> 01:03.440
as Richard Hammond
shall now explain.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:12.240 --> 01:14.599
When it comes to
their big V12 cars,

01:14.600 --> 01:16.879
their flagship battle cruisers,

01:16.880 --> 01:21.160
Lamborghini really, really like
to take their time.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.399
Just these four - the Miura,

01:25.400 --> 01:28.400
the Countash, the Diablo...

01:29.840 --> 01:33.279
and the Murcielago,
span half a century.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.520
And now, at last, there's a new one.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.920
It's called the Aventador.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.439
It costs Â£248,000.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.039
And it's the closest thing
to a stealth fighter jet

01:51.040 --> 01:53.240
that you'll ever see on the road.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.480
It even has a starter button
that's straight out of Top Gun.

02:11.560 --> 02:16.599
The current boss of Lamborghini
said recently that in the old days,

02:16.600 --> 02:20.679
the order of priority for Lamborghini
was top speed, acceleration,

02:20.680 --> 02:22.480
and handling, in that order.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.839
The thing is, for this car,

02:25.840 --> 02:28.159
he says that order
is the other way round.

02:28.160 --> 02:32.079
Handling comes first, with top speed
being given a lower priority.

02:32.080 --> 02:35.920
So, let's find out just how low
a priority that is, shall we?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Whooooa! Waaaah-hah!

02:47.840 --> 02:49.519
0 to 60, 2.9 seconds.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.640
So they still care
about acceleration, then!

02:53.960 --> 02:55.839
220 kilometres an hour,

02:55.840 --> 02:58.120
250!

02:59.400 --> 03:00.560
260!

03:03.640 --> 03:06.400
270. 280 kilometres.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.359
Oh!

03:09.360 --> 03:11.279
290 kilometres an hour.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.960
Oh my God!

03:16.440 --> 03:18.600
Oh, OK, and relax.

03:19.920 --> 03:24.000
If that's them giving top speed
a low priority, bring it on!

03:24.880 --> 03:29.999
Flat out,
the Aventador will do 217 mph...

03:30.000 --> 03:33.400
which makes it faster
than the old Murcielago.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.799
How Italian is that?

03:37.800 --> 03:42.320
No top speed, OK,
270, no more, no more than that!

03:44.760 --> 03:51.320
This pulverising performance
comes courtesy of the Aventador's
massive 6.5 litre engine...

03:52.520 --> 03:56.919
their first all-new V12
for almost 50 years.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.560
But what's surprising is that
they bothered to make one at all.

04:02.400 --> 04:07.119
You see, these days,
a lot of carmakers are shying away
from bigger engines.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.479
BMW's new M5, for example,
will have a V8 instead of a V10.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.119
AMG are ditching V12s
in favour of V8s.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.399
It's called moving with the times.

04:16.399 --> 04:20.159
But that's not so easy
with a big Lamborghini.

04:20.160 --> 04:24.559
A V12 is kind of its signature dish,
it defines the car.

04:24.560 --> 04:28.599
And the engineers insisted that
whatever happened with the Aventador,

04:28.600 --> 04:30.719
it had to have a V12.

04:30.720 --> 04:35.920
And, of course, the by-product
of a V12 is lots of horsepowers.

04:38.120 --> 04:43.400
This has got 691 of them,
which in Top Gear maths is 700.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.599
That power is fed to all four wheels

04:49.600 --> 04:53.319
through a unique design
of flappy paddle gearbox.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.719
It can change in less than
50 milliseconds, which...

04:56.720 --> 04:59.240
I can't demonstrate that
even if I blink an eye.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.239
There are other
high-tech features too.

05:03.240 --> 05:06.599
We're in strada mode right now,
which is for the road.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.080
Let's put it in corsa, track mode.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.120
Whoa, hang on!

05:14.160 --> 05:16.840
All right, fella, all right!

05:18.520 --> 05:23.280
That's absolutely brutal!
It kicks you in the back of the head.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.559
And now we're in corsa mode,

05:26.560 --> 05:30.559
let's find out how they've got on
with their new number-one priority...

05:30.560 --> 05:31.800
handling.

05:33.960 --> 05:38.519
Traditionally, always the scariest
part of testing a big Lambo.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.680
OK, here we go, I'm nervous.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.560
I'm OK.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.160
Still on the track.

05:59.360 --> 06:03.079
I'm in a V12 Lambo, I just threw it
at a corner at insane speed,

06:03.080 --> 06:04.800
and it went round.

06:07.200 --> 06:12.479
So why am I not buried in row 85
of that 747?

06:12.480 --> 06:17.359
This is partly because the grip
is just unbelievable.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.479
Also it's got push-rod suspension
which is very clever,

06:20.480 --> 06:24.280
and unheard of in an road car -
that's F1 stuff.

06:26.360 --> 06:30.239
So even when it's coming under
some pressure, like that,

06:30.240 --> 06:32.599
the steering is just...

06:32.600 --> 06:34.240
It's just... I'm turning a dial.

06:38.760 --> 06:42.239
So, whilst the Aventador
looks as Miami Vice mental

06:42.240 --> 06:47.400
as everything else in its family
tree, it's now a serious player.

06:48.720 --> 06:53.399
The noise it makes is spirited
rather than deafening.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.679
The chassis is made from
carbon fibre, not pig iron.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.199
The air-conditioning works.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.840
It's a proper car,
rather than a machine that wants,
most of all, to kill you.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.560
And that makes me a bit sad.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.759
Basically, what's missing
is that Lambo fear factor,

07:13.760 --> 07:17.439
that knot in the stomach test pilots
must have felt in the '50s

07:17.440 --> 07:21.320
when they headed for the sound
barrier in unproven jet aircraft.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.360
Of course,
you might think that's a good thing.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.840
To be honest, I'm not so sure.

07:31.040 --> 07:35.840
If a big Lamborghini
is all about pantomime, drama,
theatre, which it is...

07:37.200 --> 07:39.359
then I want people watching

07:39.360 --> 07:42.399
not just to go, "Wow,
that's a stunning-looking thing."

07:42.400 --> 07:47.159
I want them to look at me inside
and think, "Whoa, there goes
Chuck Yeager Hammond.

07:47.160 --> 07:51.239
"He's brave."
But in this, I'm not being brave.

07:51.240 --> 07:55.319
It's as easy to drive as a big Audi,
that's the truth of it.

07:55.320 --> 07:59.519
I finally understand what they mean
by that, is it Helsinki syndrome?

07:59.520 --> 08:01.479
When people who've been kidnapped,

08:01.480 --> 08:04.600
when they're released,
miss their kidnappers.

08:06.280 --> 08:10.039
I don't know that I want to be
in a big, loud V12 Lambo

08:10.040 --> 08:13.919
that doesn't every now and again
try and kill me.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.800
I miss that.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.199
Very good.
It's beautiful but it's just not...

08:28.200 --> 08:30.359
I think he made a mistake.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.119
Hammond... Whoa, hang on, hang on.

08:33.120 --> 08:37.679
Hammond, did you say, did you say
Helsinki syndrome? Yes, I did.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.280
You mean Stockholm syndrome.

08:40.919 --> 08:45.399
Yes I do. Yes.
What is Helsinki syndrome?

08:45.400 --> 08:48.719
I think it's when you're an idiot
and get your syndromes mixed up.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.000
Yeah, I've got it.

08:50.001 --> 08:55.199
Anyway, the Lamborghini.
What you're saying is, it would be
better if it were a bit worse.

08:55.200 --> 08:58.279
No, it's like that McLaren MP4-12C
you drove the other week.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.119
It is brilliant, undeniably.

09:00.120 --> 09:04.199
But somehow it's just not exciting
enough. He's right, actually.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.679
I've driven this as well
and it isn't boring

09:06.680 --> 09:10.559
but it somehow lacks that sort of
Lamborghini theatre.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.519
It's too refined
and it's sort of too clever.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.399
It's as though Lamborghini
are trying to be Ferrari

09:16.400 --> 09:18.919
instead of making cars
specifically for...

09:18.920 --> 09:20.639
Lunatics. Rod Stewart. Fish.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.959
Tadpoles. What?
No, people who like a laugh.

09:23.960 --> 09:28.079
A Lamborghini should be
an instrument of terror
and this just isn't.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.999
Well, now, let's examine
the scale of their failure

09:31.000 --> 09:33.519
by seeing how fast
it goes round our track.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.319
That means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.079
Some say that his favourite T-shirt

09:39.080 --> 09:43.319
has a picture on the front
of a T-shirt.

09:43.320 --> 09:47.559
And that he spent all week waiting
for a big cheque from the Germans,

09:47.560 --> 09:50.719
because he too has spent
the last 2,000 years

09:50.720 --> 09:54.720
sitting on his backside
doing absolutely nothing at all.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.560
All we know is,
he's called The Stig.

09:59.560 --> 10:03.799
And he's off! Ooh, I love that pop
as it shifts up.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.959
Single rather than double
clutch system.

10:05.960 --> 10:10.839
Changes are still lightning-fast
as he spears into the first corner.

10:10.840 --> 10:14.679
Wobble under braking, shows how much
speed he's already carrying.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.079
He's got it all together
for the exit.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.039
Stig listening to Petula Clark
in French, very unusual.

10:24.040 --> 10:28.039
Clean through Chicago.
Coming up now to Hammerhead.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.719
Despite carbon fibre construction,
this is still a big, heavy car.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.319
Will it get out of shape?
Not a bit of it.

10:34.320 --> 10:38.399
None of the traditional
Lambo flamboyance there.

10:45.440 --> 10:49.439
Now, follow-through, the spoiler
fully extends at 80 miles an hour.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.559
He's doing a lot more than that now.

10:51.560 --> 10:55.679
Fast through the tyres,
just two corners left.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.719
Here he comes now.
Hard on the ceramic brakes,

10:58.720 --> 11:02.399
an old V12 Lambo would have
bitten him in the face by now.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.480
Through Gambon
and across the line.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.280
Now...

11:09.800 --> 11:11.400
Now, if we look here...

11:12.800 --> 11:15.399
this is the old Lamborghini,
the Murcielago,

11:15.400 --> 11:19.560
the LP670 did it in 1:19.
Here's the Aventador.

11:22.360 --> 11:25.079
Ooooooh...

11:25.080 --> 11:28.639
1:16.5.

11:32.840 --> 11:36.359
That's interesting, isn't it?

11:36.360 --> 11:42.119
So... So it looks
absolutely fantastic.

11:42.120 --> 11:46.759
And it's faster round our track
than a Bugatti Veyron Super Sport.

11:46.760 --> 11:50.400
And I think it's clear now
why Hammond and May hate it so much.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.999
He's no idea. He knows what
we're on about, he does know.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.359
Right, it's time for us to do
the news and we begin with this.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.199
Attention morons everywhere.

12:01.200 --> 12:05.639
Mercedes have a new hardcore
AMG version of one of their cars.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.359
It's from their especially ridiculous
range of black editions.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.399
Oh, now, I'm sorry,
this is a car for connoisseurs.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.519
It's a car for idiots. It's
for people who know the difference
between Sweden and Finland.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.239
Yes, all right, sorry.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.559
This is the new black edition
of the C-class.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.999
It will cost you Â£110,000.
It's got the old 6.2 litre V8,

12:28.000 --> 12:33.119
tuned version of that, rather than
the twin turbo AMG engines of today.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.199
You also get the seven-speed
flappy paddle gearbox from an SLS.

12:37.200 --> 12:41.879
But I think it looks fantastic.
Ridiculous. It's fantastic!

12:41.880 --> 12:43.559
I think it looks infantile.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.239
It does.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.599
James, you are so old, you think
Werther's Originals are infantile.

12:49.600 --> 12:54.239
Can I just clarify this a little bit?
He has got the old CLK black.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.799
Yes, I do. And I went in it
the other day.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.519
And you loved it. I hated it!

13:00.520 --> 13:04.279
It's ridiculous! The ride is stupid.

13:04.280 --> 13:08.039
It's like being in a touring car.
What's wrong with that?

13:08.040 --> 13:11.799
Nothing at all,
if you're, I don't know, let's say,
in a touring car race.

13:11.800 --> 13:16.359
If you want to use it,
let's imagine, on a road,

13:16.360 --> 13:17.800
in, let's say, the world,

13:17.801 --> 13:22.559
it's absolutely stupid.
It's a terrible car. You may mock...

13:22.560 --> 13:24.719
Thank you, it's ridiculous.

13:24.720 --> 13:29.719
The fact is, the fact is, that
the CLK black is holding its value

13:29.720 --> 13:32.759
a lot better than, I don't know,
911s that you two have.

13:32.760 --> 13:36.079
Because they only sold 100 of them.
Yes, they did.

13:36.080 --> 13:39.079
They'd have sold more but most
of the people who bought them

13:39.080 --> 13:42.039
were wearing those jackets
that do up at the back.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.399
They were only out for the day.
"I want one of those!"

13:45.400 --> 13:49.199
Like that. They'd eaten the pens
you use to fill the options form in.

13:49.200 --> 13:53.959
It's a stupid car. It is a
stupid car. It's ridiculous.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.239
Oh, don't feel sorry for him!
Look at the wheel arches on it!

13:57.240 --> 13:58.959
Aaaah!

13:58.960 --> 14:03.399
Let's move on.
Yes, let's move on. Now...

14:03.400 --> 14:05.479
we have been sent, by a viewer,

14:05.480 --> 14:08.359
a copy of a motorcycling magazine
from 1976.

14:08.360 --> 14:11.239
We have a picture of it here,
the front cover.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.479
Sort of thing you love,
isn't it, James?

14:13.480 --> 14:16.359
Mmm. Lovely.
What distressed us greatly was,

14:16.360 --> 14:20.719
there was an advertisement on
the back page, for some leathers.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.519
And it was the model that was
being used that has terrified us.

14:24.520 --> 14:26.239
Here it is.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.640
Now... don't say that isn't you,
look!

14:39.800 --> 14:43.359
1976! Is that 1976? 1976.

14:43.360 --> 14:47.319
There is no point denying that
it's you. He's wearing brown shoes.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.959
It's got to be you. It is you.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.839
You looked exactly the same in 1976
as... When were you born?!

14:53.840 --> 14:58.359
I was only 12!
You weren't, though, were you?

14:58.360 --> 15:02.439
You know, I have speculated many,
many, many times over the years

15:02.440 --> 15:06.119
on what sort of a man
appears as a model in leather.

15:06.120 --> 15:11.679
Yeah. You've let the motorcycling
side down there, badly.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.359
Lewis Hamilton has been
in the news this week

15:14.360 --> 15:17.319
saying that the national anthem
is too short.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.839
He can't milk it on the podium,
it's over in 44 seconds.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.639
He says it's not fair,
because when Massa wins,

15:22.640 --> 15:27.479
who's Brazilian, that national
anthem goes on for 16 hours.

15:27.480 --> 15:28.879
So I've had an idea.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.879
Why don't we change
our national anthem

15:30.880 --> 15:32.599
to Wish You Were Here, Pink Floyd.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.759
27 minutes... Of hell.
It isn't hell.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.479
The problem isn't that ours
is too short,

15:38.480 --> 15:40.759
it's that everybody else's
is too long.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.599
The Greek one is. 158 verses. What?!

15:44.600 --> 15:47.879
I promise you.
The Greek national anthem...

15:47.880 --> 15:51.839
How many times can you say,
"We're completely screwed"?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.919
So you're saying ours is too...
They're all too long.

15:54.920 --> 15:59.439
I think we could set an example
to the world, actually, with
the Olympics coming up in 2012

15:59.440 --> 16:01.400
by making national anthems shorter.

16:01.401 --> 16:04.199
We could get ours pared
right down.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.279
What, "we hope she's victorious
and lives a long time." No.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.079
That's too long. Not very long.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.439
I'm thinking more along
the lines of...

16:12.440 --> 16:14.759
There you go.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.959
So he gets up on the podium and...

16:16.960 --> 16:21.359
Exactly. You'd have to have
the roll on the drums
so that people got ready.

16:24.880 --> 16:28.320
That's quick, I like it.
That is actually a brilliant idea.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.119
Last year, my CLK Mercedes...

16:32.120 --> 16:38.119
Stupid, stupid car.
With stupid wheel arches.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.799
You may think it's stupid,
but it's very determined.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.999
My CLK, it said one day
when I got in it,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.879
"24 days until the next service."

16:44.880 --> 16:47.559
I mentioned this on the programme
a year ago.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.519
I thought, I wonder what will happen
if I take it to 25 days.

16:50.520 --> 16:55.880
Its German brain won't be able
to compute the fact that somebody
has disobeyed a direct order.

16:57.280 --> 17:01.919
Thing was, on the 24th day,
Mercedes turned up while I was out

17:01.920 --> 17:06.959
and took it away for a service,
which really annoyed me. Good news.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.638
Yesterday, it suddenly said,
"Nine days until service due."

17:10.640 --> 17:13.839
What I've done this time is
I've parked it

17:13.839 --> 17:15.598
in a London underground garage

17:15.599 --> 17:18.039
and I'm not going to tell anybody
which one.

17:18.040 --> 17:22.439
I want to see what happens
when it goes to minus one.

17:22.440 --> 17:25.559
No! That's dangerous. It could panic,

17:25.560 --> 17:27.999
like a horse in a stable,
and just go mad.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.119
Or it's probably already been
building a glider so it can escape.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.639
That's why I've put it
in an underground car park

17:35.640 --> 17:38.639
and not a multi-storey,
so it can't fly away.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.559
It's probably been specially
trained to take a cyanide pill.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.119
It's hidden it in one of its
massive wheel arches.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.399
"I must end it now!"

17:47.400 --> 17:49.840
So when I go back to it,
you think it'll be dead?

17:49.841 --> 17:51.400
Completely.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.359
Last week, we had the Lotus T125
down here.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.639
It's kind of a Formula 1 car
that you can buy

17:58.640 --> 18:01.679
if you have Â£650,000 lying around.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.079
We wondered how fast it would go
around our track,

18:05.080 --> 18:09.039
whether it would be faster
than an actual Formula One car.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.119
Sadly on the day we were going to try
for a lap, it was raining.

18:12.120 --> 18:15.599
So we said we'd bring it back
when it wasn't. We have.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.919
And it isn't.
Did that make sense?

18:17.920 --> 18:19.200
I know what you mean.

18:19.201 --> 18:22.320
Anyway,
let's find out how it got on.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.760
Away he goes.
Lighting up the back tyres a treat.

18:28.080 --> 18:31.359
Not quite the sound of an F1 car.
Not as high-pitched.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.199
That is the sound of torque.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.359
The first corner.

18:35.360 --> 18:40.119
The Stig sawing away at the wheel.
It is an animal, this thing.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.120
Down the gears, into Chicago.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.359
Wrestling it through there.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.559
Stig actually demanded
a softer chassis set-up

18:49.560 --> 18:51.519
and a softer tyres for today.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.239
Will it have enough heat
in those tyres

18:54.240 --> 18:56.559
to cling on through Hammerhead?

18:56.560 --> 18:59.199
Yes, he does. Bit of a wiggle there.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.679
Now he can really open it up.
Through the follow-through.

19:02.680 --> 19:06.959
Stationary,
this car weighs 640 kilos.

19:06.960 --> 19:10.119
Flat out, thanks to the air pressing
down on those wings,

19:10.120 --> 19:14.479
it weighs two-and-a-quarter tonnes.
Coming up to the penultimate corner,

19:14.480 --> 19:16.799
hard on the brakes.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.319
Crackle on the over-run
up to Gambon,

19:19.320 --> 19:21.879
Stig still working hard.
And across the line.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.919
Now...

19:25.920 --> 19:30.159
the actual Formula 1 car
we had down here a few years ago,

19:30.160 --> 19:33.719
that did it in 59 seconds.

19:33.720 --> 19:39.079
The T125 did it
in 1 minute 3.8.

19:39.080 --> 19:43.519
So it's about four seconds a lap
slower than the Renault F1 car,

19:43.520 --> 19:47.079
which means it's the same pace
as a current Lotus F1 car.

19:49.800 --> 19:53.799
The fact is that the electric car
is very much with us.

19:53.800 --> 19:58.839
You can actually go into
a dealership and simply buy one
but the big question is, should you?

19:58.840 --> 20:02.119
What are the pitfalls?
What are the advantages?

20:02.120 --> 20:05.479
To find out, James and I decided
to do a sensible test.

20:05.480 --> 20:09.479
No clocking about, no catching fire,
no Richard Hammond.

20:09.480 --> 20:14.279
We would simply get two of the cars
that you can actually buy these days

20:14.280 --> 20:18.280
and take them on a perfectly
ordinary run to the seaside.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.439
This is the Nissan Leaf

20:23.440 --> 20:26.879
and there are no visual clues
that it's powered by electricity.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.559
It looks like every other
five-door hatchback.

20:29.560 --> 20:33.839
It also drives like every other
five-door hatchback,

20:33.840 --> 20:38.039
except the engine doesn't shout
or bellow or roar.

20:38.040 --> 20:42.559
It just sort of... hums, like a monk.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.200
Hmmmmmmm.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.359
Peugeot has gone down
a different styling route.

20:50.360 --> 20:54.879
Their new electric car, the Ion,
is designed to look futuristic

20:54.880 --> 20:57.759
and different and unusual.

20:57.760 --> 21:02.759
But, just like the Nissan,
it is like a car.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.759
Here I am driving along
the A46 towards Cleethorpes

21:05.760 --> 21:09.960
and the situation
is completely normal.

21:11.160 --> 21:16.559
Clarkson, May. Yeah, what?
Is your Nissan like a car?

21:16.560 --> 21:18.679
Yes, nothing to see here.

21:18.680 --> 21:22.719
And as I said before,
nothing to hear.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.879
This car is so quiet,

21:24.880 --> 21:28.039
they had to design a special
windscreen wiper motor for it

21:28.040 --> 21:31.879
because the one they fit in
all other Nissan's was too loud.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.919
They had a similar problem
with the door mirrors

21:34.920 --> 21:40.159
cos as you were driving all you
could hear was the air rushing
over them, not a nice sound.

21:40.160 --> 21:42.319
So they've sculpted the head lamps

21:42.320 --> 21:44.640
to deflect air away
from the mirrors.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.959
So, what about performance?

21:47.960 --> 21:52.159
The top speed
is only 81 miles an hour.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.959
And 0-60 takes something
like 16 seconds.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.599
It doesn't feel like
you're a liability on the roads.

21:57.600 --> 22:01.479
It doesn't feel like I'm holding
people up or anything like that.

22:01.480 --> 22:05.079
The Nissan has
a much bigger electric motor.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.599
It develops the equivalent
of 108 brake horsepower.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.719
That means a top speed
of 90 miles an hour

22:10.720 --> 22:13.199
and sufficient acceleration
to consider,

22:13.200 --> 22:16.559
at least, overtaking someone.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.279
James for example. Here we go.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.639
One problem I have with electric
cars is they're not very heroic.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.999
"Quick, James, I have the antidote.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.239
"We need to be at the hospital
in 20 minutes.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.839
"Only you can save me."

22:28.840 --> 22:30.439
Hmmmmm...

22:33.480 --> 22:35.199
You may regret that.

22:35.200 --> 22:39.639
68, 69 miles an hour. 70.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.799
- Or let me put it this way.
- 70.

22:42.800 --> 22:48.079
Soon we pulled over
to examine our cars more closely.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.479
I want to see what it is
that's making no noise,

22:50.480 --> 22:52.479
that's humming like a Trappist monk.

22:52.480 --> 22:56.599
Oh, that's an electric, is that an
electric...

22:56.600 --> 22:59.759
that's an electric motor, is it?
It must be.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.999
And one moving part.
Effectively, yes. And no gearbox.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.680
And there's no fuel tank so you
get a big boot. That's not bad.

23:09.480 --> 23:13.159
What's that for?
Solar panel. Is it? Yes.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.679
It's a Â£260 option
which means you could use

23:15.680 --> 23:17.799
the air-conditioning while parked,

23:17.800 --> 23:21.919
so you don't drain the main
batteries. Very clever. I like that.

23:21.920 --> 23:25.319
'The Peugeot, though,
is even cleverer.'

23:25.320 --> 23:29.159
Where's the engine?
Ah, it's in the back. Is it?

23:29.160 --> 23:34.639
It's rear-engined, rear-wheel drive.
It's a 911. It is a 911.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.839
This is what the 911 will look like
in another 10 - 15 years' time.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.320
So the engine's in there.

23:39.321 --> 23:41.959
It's under there,
the batteries are under there.

23:41.960 --> 23:45.079
That's not a very big boot.
You wouldn't get a dog in there.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.759
Discussing luggage space is like
I'm back on old Top Gear.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.639
Can I get a beard?

23:50.640 --> 23:53.279
So far then,
all seems well with these cars.

23:53.280 --> 23:56.439
But they're not what
you'd call cheap.

23:56.440 --> 24:00.599
The Nissan is Â£30,990.

24:00.600 --> 24:04.079
Nearly twice what you'd pay
for a normal car of this size.

24:04.080 --> 24:07.119
The Peugeot is even more expensive,

24:07.120 --> 24:11.600
Â£33,155.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.839
Yes, with both you get Â£5,000 back
from the Government

24:17.840 --> 24:20.959
but even with that,
they're not good value.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.399
Mine isn't even very well equipped.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.439
Have you got Sat Nav in your car,
James?

24:25.440 --> 24:29.319
No, I haven't. Have you?
Yes. Cruise control?

24:29.320 --> 24:33.759
No. So that's Â£3,000 more expensive
than this

24:33.760 --> 24:37.239
and isn't as well-equipped
or as big?

24:37.240 --> 24:39.119
And what's more,

24:39.120 --> 24:43.520
the Leaf can even deliver your own
personal Greenpeace lecture.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.119
It's talking!

24:46.120 --> 24:50.279
'By the 12th of May,
electric cars worldwide

24:50.280 --> 24:52.639
'saved a total
of 344,000 eco-trees.'

24:52.640 --> 24:57.159
What!? 'And 659 tonnes
of carbon-dioxide has been reduced.'

24:57.160 --> 25:01.759
What does that mean? What's an
eco-tree? What are you saying?

25:01.760 --> 25:06.199
Still, there is an upside
to the nagging and the cost.

25:06.200 --> 25:10.599
These days eco-ism is seen as cool.

25:10.600 --> 25:14.719
People like James May and me,
petrol heads, we're dinosaurs.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.759
If you have one of these cars
with zero emission

25:17.760 --> 25:20.759
and full electric plastered
down the side,

25:20.760 --> 25:23.119
you are more likely
to get a girlfriend.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.679
You just have to hope
she doesn't live

25:25.680 --> 25:27.879
at the other end of the country.

25:27.880 --> 25:31.879
James, can I just ask,
what range do you have left?

25:31.880 --> 25:35.319
I have 19 miles.

25:35.320 --> 25:39.519
I was down to 14 miles.
So, as is the way with all cars,

25:39.520 --> 25:43.439
we decided to buy some go juice
in the next town,

25:43.440 --> 25:45.439
which turned out to be Lincoln.

25:45.440 --> 25:50.479
And then I realised we might be
there for quite a while.

25:50.480 --> 25:54.999
James, I have another read-out
on my dashboard.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.199
Guess how long it will take

25:57.200 --> 26:00.559
to charge this up to 100%
fully charged?

26:00.560 --> 26:03.519
Well, a few hours I suppose.
Is it?

26:03.520 --> 26:07.239
'11 hours.' What?!

26:07.240 --> 26:09.479
By the time we reached
the city centre,

26:09.480 --> 26:12.479
my range was down to seven miles.

26:12.480 --> 26:17.599
So I looked on the Sat Nav for
the nearest official charging point.

26:17.600 --> 26:23.359
The nearest charging space
it gives me is 45 miles away.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.999
I can only go seven.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.559
That's very useful function
you've got there!

26:27.560 --> 26:31.719
OK, Covent Garden car park.
77 miles away.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.480
'What possible use is that?!'

26:36.680 --> 26:40.679
We pulled in at the council offices
to see if they could help.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.359
Do you have any idea where we can
charge electric cars up in Lincoln?

26:44.360 --> 26:46.519
Electric cars...

26:46.520 --> 26:49.959
It just needs a socket, really.
You do, don't you?

26:49.960 --> 26:52.839
'We didn't have to wait long
for an answer.'

26:52.840 --> 26:58.119
I checked with our team,
there are definitely no points within
Lincolnshire. Not in Lincolnshire?

26:58.120 --> 27:01.119
Who's pushing who?

27:01.120 --> 27:05.839
'Various people suggested friends
who might be able to help

27:05.840 --> 27:08.159
'but they were all too far away.'

27:08.160 --> 27:11.880
32 miles. 32? 32 miles.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.519
So, we stopped at a restaurant
in the marina

27:15.520 --> 27:18.119
to ask if we could buy
some of their electricity.

27:18.120 --> 27:22.479
Use some of your charm.
It will begin with the word "hello".

27:22.480 --> 27:25.079
Ready? "Hello." Hello.

27:25.080 --> 27:29.159
We were just wondering,
we're trying to...
We've got two electric cars.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.959
Right.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.639
James has a way with women.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.839
I should imagine he'll be able
to talk her into it, no problem.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.520
..it's going to take 12 hours.

27:42.760 --> 27:43.959
No.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.599
James, I do apologise,

27:46.600 --> 27:49.759
those boats must be getting power
from the shore.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.280
Yes, they'll have plugs
like caravan sites do.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.519
Getting to the boat park
meant more driving,

27:56.520 --> 27:59.919
so now my car was saying it would
need 13 hours to charge up.

27:59.920 --> 28:04.439
'Very low battery charge. Search for
nearest charging station.'

28:06.360 --> 28:09.199
You're just wasting electricity
telling me that.

28:09.200 --> 28:12.959
I've only got four miles left,
Jeremy must be running on

28:12.960 --> 28:15.919
whatever the equivalent of empty is
for a battery.

28:15.920 --> 28:19.119
We've just got to stop somewhere
and beg for the use of a socket.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.559
'Hello, that's it.'

28:20.560 --> 28:22.279
That's it, that's it.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.320
Oh, not there.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.839
This is the future
of motoring here.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.599
This is all of you lives here.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.239
This is what's going to become
of you all.

28:34.240 --> 28:38.239
Obviously, the solution would be
to get a tow from James.

28:38.240 --> 28:42.759
However... "Do not tow this vehicle
with all four wheels on the ground.

28:42.760 --> 28:46.799
"This may cause serious
and expensive damage to the motor."

28:46.800 --> 28:48.199
Thank you.

28:48.200 --> 28:53.439
Thankfully, some of the large crowd
we'd attracted
kindly pushed me to the boat park.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.480
However...

28:56.440 --> 28:58.119
I can see two problems with this.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.080
You have got to get across
that water.

29:00.081 --> 29:02.439
And the other one is...
It's too short. Yes.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.640
We'll have to push it
somewhere else.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.959
So, once more, we appealed
to the good people of Lincoln

29:09.960 --> 29:15.640
who pushed me to the university
where, finally,
we found somewhere to charge up.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.919
See that,
blue light on the dashboard.

29:18.920 --> 29:23.399
When all three are flashing,
it's fully charged. OK? Right.

29:23.400 --> 29:30.599
We now had a 13-hour wait but,
thankfully, we were in the
magnificent city of Lincoln,

29:30.600 --> 29:33.239
where there are many things
to see and do.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.960
I like a good cathedral.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.639
I would never normally
be brass rubbing

29:40.640 --> 29:43.239
and do you know why
I've never done it?

29:43.240 --> 29:46.599
All the cars I've ever owned have
been powered by petrol or diesel.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.399
Look, it's Hammond,
only in a diving bell.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.200
It does look a bit like Hammond,
actually.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.839
Lincoln Castle was founded
by William the Conqueror 1068,

29:57.840 --> 30:00.079
two years after the Norman Conquest.

30:00.080 --> 30:03.239
You can't build a stone castle
on the earth and banks,

30:03.240 --> 30:07.039
initially, you have to wait
for the banks to compact down.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.959
That is the best building
in the world. Really?

30:09.960 --> 30:14.240
For a department store, that's
a fantastic piece of architecture.

30:16.520 --> 30:19.879
What's he doing?
I'm doing an abstract floor rubbing.

30:19.880 --> 30:22.119
Look at that,
that's quite interesting.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.959
Basically, in the Ice Age,

30:24.960 --> 30:27.759
the Lincolnshire edge -
a big lump of limestone.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.279
Do you know what this hill
is called? Hill?

30:30.280 --> 30:34.680
No. Steep Hill. Is it?
Yes, it really is.
They spent ages thinking of that.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.439
Can you see the square frontage?

30:37.440 --> 30:40.719
Yeah. There's a square within
the square. Yeah.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.560
That is like a Norman
fortified building...

30:45.000 --> 30:47.759
You know Nissan are going
to start putting

30:47.760 --> 30:50.599
fast-charge points
at all their dealerships?

30:50.600 --> 30:53.239
You'll be able to charge your
car up in 30 minutes. Hmm.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.680
The problem is, do that all
the time, then you could

30:55.681 --> 30:59.319
ruin the battery pack
in three years.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.959
Yeah, how much is a new battery
pack? Â£7,000.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.359
Really? Actually, Nissan
can't say how much,

31:04.360 --> 31:07.959
but we rang an expert.
He said, in today's money, Â£7,000.

31:07.960 --> 31:12.079
How long do they think batteries
last if you charge them
slowly and don't thrash them?

31:12.080 --> 31:15.639
If you charge them up when
they're half empty, rather than

31:15.640 --> 31:20.239
letting them get all the way
flat, maximum, ten years.

31:20.240 --> 31:25.039
Possibly five.
It's not that long, is it? No.

31:25.040 --> 31:28.759
Are you going to go?
I can't go, actually.

31:28.760 --> 31:32.720
Since you put that in...
my word doesn't fit any more.

31:36.080 --> 31:40.160
As evening fell, we really were
running out of things to do.

31:41.320 --> 31:46.719
I think mine's worked quite well.
Yeah, not bad. Hurt like hell.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.599
Is mine all right? Look.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.360
What is it? What does it say?

31:58.080 --> 31:59.120
What?

32:02.560 --> 32:05.719
The next morning, after the longest
refuelling stop in history,

32:05.720 --> 32:08.240
we set out once more for
Cleethorpes.

32:10.120 --> 32:16.320
'As of the 12th May,
your energy economy was
0.1 kilowatt hours per mile.'

32:18.480 --> 32:24.519
The cost of charging this up
at the University with its
cheap deal was Â£2.34.

32:24.520 --> 32:27.399
But, if you charge it up during
the day, depending on

32:27.400 --> 32:33.279
who your supplier is
and what deal you've done,
it could cost you Â£8.30.

32:33.280 --> 32:37.400
That's Â£8.30 to do -
it says - 100 miles.

32:38.720 --> 32:42.599
To do 100 miles in a Golf BlueMotion
diesel will cost about the same.

32:42.600 --> 32:48.039
But remember, the Golf is
over Â£7,000 cheaper to buy.

32:48.040 --> 32:51.759
And its fuel tank is unlikely
to be worn out after five years.

32:51.760 --> 32:55.159
There are other issues, too.

32:55.160 --> 32:57.839
One of the problems
with the electric car is

32:57.840 --> 33:02.159
you drive constantly
as if on an economy run, because a
part of your brain is acutely aware

33:02.160 --> 33:05.799
that when it's gone,
you're in for a big wait.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.439
It will get different.
They'll have quick charging,

33:08.440 --> 33:11.079
three-phase charging,
batteries will improve, yes.

33:11.080 --> 33:15.719
But today, with this car on sale,
you simply have to accept

33:15.720 --> 33:18.680
that you're going to learn a lot
of medieval history.

33:19.720 --> 33:23.639
Plus you really do need to be able
to work out where you'll be

33:23.640 --> 33:25.679
when the charge runs out.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.359
And that's not easy.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.919
So I've now done 26 miles
since I set off

33:30.920 --> 33:34.680
but I've lost 40 miles of range.

33:36.360 --> 33:40.159
Interesting. I've also done 26 miles
but this is the bit you'll like,

33:40.160 --> 33:42.120
I've gained two miles of range.

33:45.080 --> 33:48.039
A lot of people think I have
a downer on the electric motor.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.079
I don't. Nothing wrong
with it at all.

33:50.080 --> 33:54.119
Theoretically, it could be immensely
powerful. And I like the Leaf.

33:54.120 --> 33:57.279
Beautifully made, is very quiet.
It's extremely comfortable.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.639
And spacious. Good car.

34:00.640 --> 34:04.719
But the batteries it uses
have to be recharged from the mains

34:04.720 --> 34:07.119
and I don't think that's the answer.

34:07.120 --> 34:12.119
I think that what I'm actually
driving is a squariel
or a laser disc

34:12.120 --> 34:13.600
or a Beta tape machine.

34:16.159 --> 34:20.799
Batteries? Batteries are rubbish.
Batteries are rubbish in everything.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.679
Think of all the things
that are battery-powered.

34:23.679 --> 34:27.199
Torches and mobile phones
and digital cameras and laptops.

34:27.199 --> 34:31.440
I bet you, they're all either
completely flat or going flat
very quickly.

34:34.040 --> 34:37.639
Eventually we arrived
in Cleethorpes.

34:37.639 --> 34:39.600
We've made it to the seaside.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.560
And it was on the dodgems
that we had an epiphany.

34:51.000 --> 34:56.319
This is an electric car.
But it has no on-board battery.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.479
It takes its power from
the chicken wire in the roof.

34:59.480 --> 35:02.159
Yes, all we have to do, really,
is put chicken wire

35:02.160 --> 35:05.079
above all the motorways
and dual carriageways in Britain.

35:05.080 --> 35:08.639
You drive to your nearest one,
extend the pole on
the back of your car,

35:08.640 --> 35:10.959
and off you go driving on the mains.

35:10.960 --> 35:14.319
It gets better than that, you know,
because if the traffic's

35:14.320 --> 35:18.119
really busy on the motorway,
the government could just
cut the power a bit

35:18.120 --> 35:20.919
and everyone would go slowly,
then if it was empty they

35:20.920 --> 35:23.119
increase the power
and everyone goes fast.

35:23.120 --> 35:26.519
Actually if there was an accident
or some bad congestion ahead

35:26.520 --> 35:30.479
they could just turn it off
and everybody would glide to
a safe halt at the same rate.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.479
We have solved it.

35:32.480 --> 35:34.399
We have solved it.

35:34.400 --> 35:39.559
If you think about it,
if you're driving along the motorway
and you're really bored,

35:39.560 --> 35:42.999
you could just deliberately crash
into someone to amuse yourself.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.919
That's true. Motorways are
boring, aren't they? Exactly.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.679
So you just drive along doing this
to the man next to you...

35:48.680 --> 35:51.200
These cars, then,
are not the future.

35:53.720 --> 35:57.119
But they did at least bring us
to where the future lies.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.639
Oh, no, I've got oversteer.

35:58.640 --> 36:02.079
Nobody does this deliberately
on the motorway. Do they?

36:08.000 --> 36:11.839
Er... What? Chaps.

36:11.840 --> 36:16.719
So, you are proposing a sort of
chicken-wire grid above all of

36:16.720 --> 36:19.999
the nation's motorways. Have you
two completely lost your minds?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.159
Bringing you out in
a Helsinki syndrome?

36:22.160 --> 36:25.239
Yeah, it's itching. It's bad,
it is. It is a brilliant idea.

36:25.240 --> 36:28.639
I've had another one. It's based on
the London tube network.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.079
It's electrified roads.
Yeah, brilliant.

36:31.080 --> 36:34.160
I'll just cross the road to that shop
there. Dzzzz. It's a stupid idea.

36:35.160 --> 36:39.439
I've had an even better idea.
What about, you fit a car with
a special tank,

36:39.440 --> 36:43.799
into which you put
a flammable liquid.

36:43.800 --> 36:47.999
When the liquid runs out,
you pull into, let's call it
a petrol station, fill it up

36:48.000 --> 36:52.239
in a couple of minutes, and you'd
never have to go brass rubbing.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.679
I think that might catch on.
But seriously,

36:54.680 --> 36:57.559
what are we all going to do
when the oil finally becomes

36:57.560 --> 37:01.359
too expensive to use for personal
transport? Which it will.

37:01.360 --> 37:06.639
Well, it's tricky, the government
recently said that there will
never be a charge point.

37:06.640 --> 37:10.039
On every street corner
so you will be reduced
to going to universities...

37:10.040 --> 37:12.199
and that's not practical -
like what we did.

37:12.200 --> 37:17.839
And you can't use a hybrid
because that uses a petrol engine
to charge up the batteries.

37:17.840 --> 37:22.439
So, we're going to have to have
a whole new approach. Dodgems.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.319
No, Honda are already there.
It's hydrogen. It has to be.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.679
Truth be told, it is hydrogen.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.999
Yes, but isn't hydrogen very
complicated to work out?

37:31.000 --> 37:34.799
Yes, but it was complicated to take
television from Logie Baird's attic

37:34.800 --> 37:39.519
to the point where you're now
appearing on a television
in Syria, but they did it.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.000
In a very short time. They did.

37:41.001 --> 37:46.759
Anyway, it is now time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

37:46.760 --> 37:50.359
My guest tonight is responsible for
bands such as Boyzone,

37:50.360 --> 37:52.479
Westlife, and Jedward.

37:52.480 --> 37:57.759
And yet surprisingly, he hasn't been
tried for crimes against humanity.

37:57.760 --> 38:01.400
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the other
one from the X Factor, Louis Walsh.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.839
Have a seat.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.439
Have a seat.

38:10.440 --> 38:13.320
Louis Walsh, he's come among us.

38:14.680 --> 38:20.439
And, um, now, to be fair,

38:20.440 --> 38:23.959
I happen to know you do have
very good musical taste.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.799
Of course I do, yeah.
I mean, it doesn't LOOK like you do.

38:26.800 --> 38:30.319
In my job, in my day job?
Yeah. That's what I sell.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.799
I'm in the music business.
So, you sell?

38:32.800 --> 38:35.559
What I listen to at home
is totally different.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.559
I happen to know that you
and I share a...

38:37.560 --> 38:41.719
What, one person, yeah. Bob Segar.
And the Silver Bullet Band.
Silver Bullet Band.

38:41.720 --> 38:45.959
Who here is familiar with Bob Segar
and the Silver Bullet Band? Yes.

38:45.960 --> 38:50.159
Yes? A big fan?
That's one big fan and I think
that's enough of a reason

38:50.160 --> 38:52.759
to discuss Bob Segar at some length.

38:52.760 --> 38:56.199
What is your favourite
Bob Segar song?

38:56.200 --> 38:59.119
Ooh. Night Moves, I think.

38:59.120 --> 39:02.359
I agree. What would you go with,
Night Moves, best one?

39:02.360 --> 39:04.919
No, Old Time Rock And Roll.
Old Time Rock And Roll.

39:04.920 --> 39:08.079
Old Time is good, yeah. As used
in Risky Business? Absolutely.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.519
Starring Tom Cruise.
I've a Wurlitzer jukebox,

39:10.520 --> 39:13.239
all the old 45s.
I'm a fan of music.

39:13.240 --> 39:17.199
So are you just flogging the noises
that come out of...? I sell.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.879
You sell Jedward?
Yeah, they do incredibly well.

39:19.880 --> 39:25.759
Do you listen to Jedward at home?
No. Honestly, no, no, I don't.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.639
Does anybody own a Jedward record?

39:27.640 --> 39:32.399
They've a new album out next week.
Have they? Yeah. I'm not interested.
Doing really well around Europe.

39:32.400 --> 39:35.879
Still not interested. Your kids
would like them. No, they wouldn't.

39:35.880 --> 39:39.719
They would! Kids love Jedward.
They'd get savagely beaten!

39:39.720 --> 39:42.399
Kids like Jedward and Westlife
and Take That.

39:42.400 --> 39:46.119
Having established that you are
a man of great musical taste.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.719
At home. At home, yes. At home.

39:48.720 --> 39:53.199
Is it Cowell, then, that's
got the Celine Dion fixation?

39:53.200 --> 39:56.319
Has Simon Cowell got
a rubbish musical taste?

39:56.320 --> 39:57.639
Yes.

39:57.640 --> 40:02.159
Absolutely. He gave us Robson
and Jerome. He did, actually.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.959
And he gave us Zig and Zag.

40:03.960 --> 40:07.839
Has he, do you think, in his house
got any Led Zeppelin at all?

40:07.840 --> 40:10.879
No. Absolutely not.
I have Led Zeppelin albums at home.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.399
Bad Company?

40:12.400 --> 40:15.359
Bad Company, Can't Get Enough?
He wouldn't know who they were.

40:15.360 --> 40:19.039
He has a lot of bad company
but it is not the band.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.919
So, anyway, X Factor, when is that
back? What stage are we at now?

40:22.920 --> 40:26.119
That's series eight, it's back,
we've got three new judges.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.559
We've got Gary Barlow,
Kelly Rowland, who was in

40:28.560 --> 40:31.919
Destiny's Child, and we've got
Tulisa from the N-Dubz.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.399
I know Gary Barlow. Yeah.
You'd know Destiny's Child.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.359
It's three girls, Beyonce was
like the front lady in the band.

40:38.360 --> 40:42.479
Boncey what? Beyonce. Beyonce!
She's like a big, big star.

40:42.480 --> 40:47.679
Boncey and who?
She's married to Jay-Z. What?

40:47.680 --> 40:49.639
Jay-Z. He's very cool.

40:49.640 --> 40:52.679
Literally no idea what you're
talking about now. So, anyway,

40:52.680 --> 40:55.759
the important thing to establish
is when is the X Factor back?

40:55.760 --> 40:59.439
Back on TV August, ITV.
Until September?

40:59.440 --> 41:01.639
December 12th.

41:01.640 --> 41:04.279
I have to ask you this
because we have to go out

41:04.280 --> 41:06.478
on Top Gear on a Sunday night
when you're not on.

41:06.479 --> 41:07.760
And my children say,

41:07.761 --> 41:10.919
when we are sitting on a beach
freezing ourselves to death

41:10.920 --> 41:13.279
in December,
"Daddy, why are we here now?"

41:13.280 --> 41:16.519
"Because Louis and Simon..."
Simon's not on this year.

41:16.520 --> 41:20.279
Oh, he's gone.
"Because Louis and Boncey's mate..."

41:20.280 --> 41:24.639
Beyonce. "..are watching a girl
who last week was working
behind a till in Asda

41:24.640 --> 41:26.240
"and she's on a journey."

41:27.960 --> 41:29.599
Everyone's on a journey.

41:29.600 --> 41:34.399
We have to move Top Gear to get out
the way of the ratings juggernaut.

41:34.400 --> 41:37.999
Because people wouldn't watch
Top Gear. They'd prefer X Factor.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.799
We know, which is really annoying!
But anyway... Anyway!

41:40.800 --> 41:42.919
..while we're on the subject
of the X Factor.

41:42.920 --> 41:47.839
Is it true that Simon Cowell
bought you all Botox vouchers?

41:47.840 --> 41:49.679
He actually did, last Christmas.

41:49.680 --> 41:53.079
You know what, you know something?
I haven't used mine. No!

41:53.080 --> 41:58.159
I'd like to... Jeremy, Jeremy...

41:58.160 --> 42:01.759
I'd like to offer it to you.
Seriously. I won't use them.

42:01.760 --> 42:04.319
Is that where you get injected,
or is that collagen?

42:04.320 --> 42:06.679
What do you do with Botox?
It's your face.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.479
What do you do with it?
Ask Simon next time he's on.

42:09.480 --> 42:12.759
Does he do Botox? Hello!

42:12.760 --> 42:15.200
Every time he's on he goes,
"You really should..."

42:15.201 --> 42:19.519
"Darling!" "Darling,
take more care of your appearance."

42:19.520 --> 42:22.319
I always think, but what could
I do to improve myself?

42:22.320 --> 42:25.999
Do you want my Botox vouchers? No!

42:26.000 --> 42:29.399
I want to talk to you about cars.
Because this is a car show.

42:29.400 --> 42:34.079
What turns you on about a car?
I like the look of cars.
I just love looking at cars.

42:34.080 --> 42:37.839
I love looking at
Lamborghinis, Maseratis, Ferraris.

42:37.840 --> 42:40.959
Bentleys, Rolls, I love...
I'm always taking pictures of them.

42:40.960 --> 42:43.679
I don't like driving fast
but I love looking at cars.

42:43.680 --> 42:47.959
It's the aesthetics of a car?
Absolutely. After... Which was
the first one? Boy's World?

42:47.960 --> 42:51.399
I had a Toledo. Boyzone was
my first band. Your first band?

42:51.400 --> 42:54.479
My first car was a Toledo.
It was a white Toledo.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.999
Yes, and I took it out
the very first time ever.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.119
I was parking it at home and I put
my foot on the accelerator.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.599
I went bang into the wall
and wrecked the car.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.759
The first time I took it out.
The first time?

43:05.760 --> 43:10.079
The first time I'd taken it out.
And were you employed as a
record-company chauffeur?

43:10.080 --> 43:15.479
I wasn't employed as a chauffeur,
I was an agent. I used to bring
artists to Ireland, singers,

43:15.480 --> 43:20.239
different singers, like Sinitta.
I used to drive them around
to the gigs. In your Toledo?

43:20.240 --> 43:23.999
No, I had a Mustang.
I had a really nice Mustang.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.119
Do you remember what period Mustang?

43:26.120 --> 43:29.679
It was red and black,
that's all I remember.

43:29.680 --> 43:35.799
I'm driving a Maserati now. I've had
it three years. A Gran Turismo. I've
done 3,000 miles in it. 3,000 miles?

43:35.800 --> 43:38.119
3,000 miles. In three years?

43:38.120 --> 43:44.719
Yeah. Do you like it? I love it!
I love looking at it. I wash it
every week. I love the car.

43:44.720 --> 43:47.519
That's the first time we've ever
had a guest who says,

43:47.520 --> 43:49.559
"I love my car,
I watch it every week."

43:49.560 --> 43:53.119
I wash it. Wash it.
Oh, wash it! I'm a bit mutton.

43:53.120 --> 43:57.239
So you have a penchant for
American cars and good-looking cars.

43:57.240 --> 44:02.079
But you're not really a driver? I'm
not a fast driver. So, the bad news.

44:02.080 --> 44:05.799
I know I'm a terrible driver.
I know.

44:05.800 --> 44:11.999
How do we know? I know!
I drove around that bloody track.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.359
I ended up on the grass.
I know I'm not good. I'm probably
the worst you've ever had.

44:16.360 --> 44:19.359
Sadly, when you went on the grass,
the cameras weren't running.

44:19.360 --> 44:26.280
Oh, good. Yes, they were! Unusually,
I believe this is the first corner.

44:28.760 --> 44:31.719
Yes, look, here you go.
Foot still in it.

44:31.720 --> 44:36.159
That's the dictionary definition
of understeer. Still in it!

44:36.160 --> 44:39.679
I love the way that you had
the hope that it was going to be

44:39.680 --> 44:43.079
OK as a lap time. "Still keep
going!" Have many people done that?

44:43.080 --> 44:48.119
The only person who ever went off
there was Lionel Richie.

44:48.120 --> 44:52.519
Lionel? The wheel fell off.
That was the only reason. OK, OK.

44:52.520 --> 44:59.280
Who would like to see the actual
lap? YEAH! Let's have a look.
Here we go.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.080
Racy start.

45:03.240 --> 45:04.639
No wheel spin. Why not?

45:04.640 --> 45:09.239
There's a terrible smell of oil.
The handbrake is on.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.720
It was on, yes!
You set off with the handbrake on?

45:11.721 --> 45:15.639
OK, let's have a look at turn one.
Have we got it right this time?

45:18.680 --> 45:20.999
Yes, no, yes. Just held it all
together there.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.199
Ooh, changed gear.
I need Stig, badly.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.719
I need Stig, yes. He was good.

45:27.720 --> 45:30.199
You're going a very long way
round.

45:30.200 --> 45:31.279
Argh!

45:31.280 --> 45:32.319
Oh...

45:32.320 --> 45:34.599
I'm going to be the last
person ever.

45:34.600 --> 45:38.079
You really do need to get those
gear-changes worked out.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.680
It's going, ra-ra-ra!
I drive an automatic car.

45:42.920 --> 45:44.039
Change gear!

45:44.040 --> 45:47.680
Change gear. What are gears?
There we go, that's it.

45:48.640 --> 45:51.760
OK, here we go. I'm finally
going to fly this one.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.559
Scary doing that. Here we go.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.360
I hope I'm insured.

46:01.080 --> 46:04.359
No, you don't needs to be insured.
Nothing to hit.

46:04.360 --> 46:08.599
Second to last corner. That's rather
a neat line through there,
if I may say.

46:08.600 --> 46:13.519
And Gambon.
That's also very nicely done.

46:13.520 --> 46:15.159
Across the line, everybody.

46:21.640 --> 46:22.880
So...

46:24.640 --> 46:26.599
There it is, where do you think?

46:26.600 --> 46:28.319
I'm near the bottom.

46:28.320 --> 46:31.959
These are wet times. Ignore the
wet times. Anything with W after it.

46:31.960 --> 46:35.679
The slowest we've ever had was
Amber Heard, and she did a 1.50.3.

46:35.680 --> 46:39.239
You think you were slower than that?
Am I under Angelina Jolie?

46:41.760 --> 46:42.680
I don't know!

46:42.681 --> 46:46.400
Right, 1:53 is the slowest so far.
You did it in 1...

46:48.400 --> 46:50.999
40... Oh, really?

46:51.000 --> 46:53.959
7.7. That's not bad.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.920
That's good!

47:00.840 --> 47:03.919
Sitting there between Alastair
Campbell and Danny Boyle.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.559
Wow. A weird place to find yourself.

47:06.560 --> 47:09.679
So I did better than Geldof?
You what?

47:09.680 --> 47:14.159
I did better than Bob Geldof.
Oh yes, you beat Gob Beldof.
I'm happy.

47:14.160 --> 47:16.719
And Al Murray. So there we are.
There we are.

47:16.720 --> 47:20.159
The audience loves you,
the Stig loves you,
we all love you.

47:20.160 --> 47:24.199
Ladies and gentlemen, Louis Walsh!

47:24.200 --> 47:25.560
Louis Walsh!

47:33.360 --> 47:39.839
Now, we recently received
an invitation to a motorsport event.

47:39.840 --> 47:44.319
And as it involved mud and
4x4s and it was in Wales,

47:44.320 --> 47:46.399
who better to attend, we thought,

47:46.400 --> 47:50.880
than Top Gear's own Minister for
Rural Affairs, Richard Hammond?

47:54.480 --> 47:57.719
'This is cross-country racing.'

47:57.720 --> 48:00.559
'It takes place at various locations
across Britain

48:00.560 --> 48:03.199
'and for the teams taking part,

48:03.200 --> 48:06.200
'it's one of the toughest amateur
motor sports around.'

48:10.600 --> 48:15.879
We're here to follow one of those
teams as they take part in their
very first event.

48:15.880 --> 48:19.399
But here's the thing,
there's something about these guys

48:19.400 --> 48:22.920
that takes that challenge
to a whole new level.

48:26.880 --> 48:33.279
'This team is made up of soldiers
who've all suffered massive injuries
whilst fighting in Afghanistan.'

48:33.280 --> 48:36.160
'Soldiers like Tom, the co-driver.'

48:37.120 --> 48:38.839
I was a sniper out there.

48:38.840 --> 48:43.039
I shifted a sandbag and detonated
a booby-trap IED.

48:43.040 --> 48:46.319
I just lost my feet to begin with
and through infection,

48:46.320 --> 48:50.319
and other various things, I kept
having to have aggressive surgery

48:50.320 --> 48:54.719
and ended up basically losing my
left arm and having my legs
amputated.

48:54.720 --> 48:58.319
'Then there's Gav,
the team's mechanic.'

48:58.320 --> 49:00.999
I was unlucky enough to strike
an IED,

49:01.000 --> 49:05.399
obviously maiming me, leaving
me a bilateral amputee.

49:05.400 --> 49:08.999
I lost both my femoral arteries.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.720
I've got no idea how I survived
that, to be fair.

49:13.400 --> 49:18.800
'Compared to those two, Tony the
driver actually feels quite lucky.'

49:20.200 --> 49:22.400
I'm a below-knee scratch.
Is that what you call it!?

49:22.401 --> 49:26.879
Having been mercilessly ripped by
Tom and others for being,

49:26.880 --> 49:31.119
well, it's just a flesh wound,
really - to quote Monty Python.

49:31.120 --> 49:34.559
'These soldiers are using motor sport
as a way of helping them

49:34.560 --> 49:36.679
'come to terms with their injuries.'

49:36.680 --> 49:41.039
'They've set themselves an incredible
challenge, because in just 18 months,

49:41.040 --> 49:45.880
'they aim to compete in the world's
most gruelling race...'

49:47.080 --> 49:50.920
'The fearsome Dakar rally.'

49:54.840 --> 49:57.199
I know there's amputees
all round the world

49:57.200 --> 49:59.999
but for us, it's like pushing it
as far as we can.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.879
If you can crack on in a Dakar rally
when you're doing 18-hour days

50:03.880 --> 50:07.280
for two weeks solid, you can
pretty much achieve anything.

50:08.640 --> 50:12.119
Your career's going one direction
and all of a sudden it grinds
to a halt

50:12.120 --> 50:16.639
and you have to think about a
totally different way of living
your life.

50:16.640 --> 50:20.680
It's important to challenge
yourself, to keep on challenging
yourself.

50:22.040 --> 50:26.119
'Out on the eight-mile course,
most of the other competitors

50:26.120 --> 50:28.680
'are running in powerful,
bespoke 4x4s.'

50:30.360 --> 50:33.719
'But the soldiers must begin
their long climb to the Dakar

50:33.720 --> 50:37.039
'in a humble Land Rover Freelander.'

50:37.040 --> 50:39.720
First disabled team to do this,
mate.

50:40.720 --> 50:44.200
Amber. 3, 2, 1, go.

50:47.320 --> 50:49.320
Straight down here, mate.

50:51.080 --> 50:53.439
Brake, brake, brake, brake.

50:53.440 --> 50:54.560
Good, good.

50:56.560 --> 50:59.119
What would you like to see come out
of this weekend?

50:59.120 --> 51:02.399
I'd like to see it function,
for a start.

51:02.400 --> 51:05.719
To find out where our weaknesses
are and work on them,

51:05.720 --> 51:07.880
just keep focusing
on our weaknesses.

51:09.200 --> 51:14.759
That's it.
'Tony and Tom complete their first
run in 12 minutes 14,

51:14.760 --> 51:17.680
'some four minutes shy
of the big boys.'

51:19.200 --> 51:22.479
'Already, they've discovered
a problem that is unique to them.'

51:22.480 --> 51:25.159
The problem we've got is obviously

51:25.160 --> 51:29.399
because Tony's missing his left leg,
he can't feel the palm of his foot

51:29.400 --> 51:33.039
on the clutch and that's going to
give slip and you'll lose power.

51:33.040 --> 51:36.239
I think what we're going to do
is devise a light that comes on

51:36.240 --> 51:40.919
and warns him he's riding the
clutch, so he can pull his leg off.
Neat idea.

51:40.920 --> 51:44.999
'The clutch fix isn't one
that can be done on site.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.280
'So, for now,
the team must crack on regardless.'

51:50.960 --> 51:53.359
'And crack on, they do.'

51:53.360 --> 51:55.680
You did 10.54 on that last one.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.840
Hairpin. First gear, mate.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.200
10.41 on that one.

52:05.320 --> 52:07.879
Go through, go through, go through.

52:07.880 --> 52:11.039
'Spending a day with them,

52:11.040 --> 52:14.959
'it becomes obvious their injuries
are more than just physical.'

52:14.960 --> 52:18.239
The bloke alongside you, killed?

52:18.240 --> 52:19.759
Yes, Anthony Lombardi.

52:19.760 --> 52:22.999
He was also a mechanic.
Young lad, 21 year old.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.719
He was a really good bloke, yes...

52:25.720 --> 52:27.359
It just, I think,

52:27.360 --> 52:31.160
it's difficult because... Um...

52:34.120 --> 52:36.800
Can you just give us a minute?
Please. As long as you want, mate.

52:42.040 --> 52:42.960
Oh, mate...

52:46.320 --> 52:51.519
'It's then that you start to realise
the value of a project like this.'

52:51.520 --> 52:54.279
These guys are soldiers,
they're men of action.

52:54.280 --> 52:57.159
They're used to having challenges,
problems,

52:57.160 --> 53:00.199
obstacles to overcome by working
together as a team.

53:00.200 --> 53:05.639
This isn't a treat. This is therapy,
it's something they need to do

53:05.640 --> 53:09.160
if they're going to recover as well
as they possibly can.

53:11.480 --> 53:16.880
'By the end of the first day,
the amputee team are running second
in the Freelander class.'

53:17.840 --> 53:21.400
Hey, mate!
'But there's little time
for celebration...

53:24.440 --> 53:30.120
'because they must very quickly get
to grips with the car they'll be
driving in the Dakar,

53:31.080 --> 53:35.440
'a four-litre, V8 engine Wildcat.'

53:39.640 --> 53:41.559
To make the move to this,

53:41.560 --> 53:45.359
the guys are going to need some
training from an expert driver.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.840
And we've got one.

53:50.320 --> 53:54.079
'Yes, it's ex-Stig,
special forces driving instructor

53:54.080 --> 53:56.680
'and romantic novelist, Ben Collins.'

53:57.640 --> 54:02.319
All right? Are we ready? Yes,
very good, looking forward to it.
Good, good.

54:02.320 --> 54:06.799
When you're going round, don't tell
him anything, he'll put it in
a book. Make sure of that.

54:06.800 --> 54:09.959
All right, men?
All right? Aye!

54:09.960 --> 54:13.879
If you see Ryan, stop talking.
Leave it at that, all right?

54:13.880 --> 54:16.000
Have fun.
Happy days. OK, let's crank it.

54:19.240 --> 54:23.719
Do you know, to be honest, I am quite
glad to see the old splitter back.

54:23.720 --> 54:27.560
And I do know how much giving these
guys a hand means to him.

54:28.920 --> 54:31.360
So, this is all right.

54:36.080 --> 54:39.760
'Clearly, Jilly Cooper had lost
none of his teaching skills.'

54:41.360 --> 54:45.679
Pop it back into second.
You don't want to use the brakes,
just pop in the gas.

54:45.680 --> 54:51.080
Go. 'Which meant on their first
solo outing, Tony and Tom
didn't disappoint.'

54:52.040 --> 54:55.719
Just remember this bit here,
Tone. Nice.

54:55.720 --> 54:59.199
That's a nine minute 51 guys.
We'll do it faster next time.
Yes.

54:59.200 --> 55:01.919
'But mastering the Wildcat
is just the beginning,

55:01.920 --> 55:06.679
'because these guys face problems
that their rivals won't encounter.'

55:06.680 --> 55:11.159
There you go, mate.
'Gavin, for example, has had
to devise a unique system

55:11.160 --> 55:13.760
'for doing repairs
in the middle of nowhere.'

55:15.480 --> 55:19.319
'Tiredness is an issue too.
As a triple amputee,

55:19.320 --> 55:25.240
'Tom uses 300% more energy
than an able-bodied person,
just to move around.'

55:26.560 --> 55:28.759
'And then, there's their prosthetics.

55:28.760 --> 55:31.479
If I show you the back of mine,

55:31.480 --> 55:33.999
it makes more sense.
See the back of here?

55:34.000 --> 55:38.239
That is quite unnerving when you do
that. You just wanted to do that.

55:38.240 --> 55:41.439
Sand's getting
into the piston there,

55:41.440 --> 55:44.799
getting water into the
electronics, it's all electronic

55:44.800 --> 55:47.759
but if the legs play up
and that, I can just...

55:47.760 --> 55:50.519
pop them in the back
and just crack on.

55:52.520 --> 55:55.439
'One thing that won't let
them down is their camaraderie,

55:55.440 --> 56:00.479
'which shows up best when they
talk about the kind of tricks they'd
play on each other in hospital.'

56:00.480 --> 56:04.519
One of the big ones was swapping
their wheelchair by the bedside
while they slept,

56:04.520 --> 56:06.919
with maybe an office chair
with castor wheels,

56:06.920 --> 56:10.599
and then pushing them around
and that for the rest of the day.

56:10.600 --> 56:14.399
Or padlocking them to their beds.
So they set off and...?!

56:14.400 --> 56:18.439
I got injured about a week
after a guy, a ranger, Andy Allen.

56:18.440 --> 56:22.119
Basically he lost his eyesight
and both his legs as well.

56:22.120 --> 56:24.519
He was a big Manchester United fan,
huge.

56:24.520 --> 56:27.079
The guy obviously had
Manchester United shirts

56:27.080 --> 56:29.679
and we swapped them all
for Liverpool shirts

56:29.680 --> 56:34.479
and the guy would be cutting
round in Liverpool shirts. That is
a properly devious idea!

56:34.480 --> 56:38.079
But when he started to get his
eyesight back a little bit,

56:38.080 --> 56:41.079
he basically just
let loose on us then.

56:41.080 --> 56:45.199
It feeds the sense of humour
that you're used to
and takes it a step further.

56:45.200 --> 56:48.159
It also makes you come to terms
with what's happened to you.

56:48.160 --> 56:51.599
You don't have to stop being you
just because of what's happened.

56:51.600 --> 56:54.200
You don't have to...
People shouldn't pity you.

56:57.680 --> 56:58.959
Come on.

56:58.960 --> 57:04.160
'Throughout the day, the lads have
been getting faster and faster.'

57:05.240 --> 57:10.079
You've just done two runs.
That was a 9.17 and a 9.08.

57:10.080 --> 57:13.440
Break that barrier! Eight second.

57:15.240 --> 57:18.479
'And as they lined up for the last
run of the weekend,

57:18.480 --> 57:21.839
'everybody - us, the organisers,
the other competitors,

57:21.840 --> 57:25.280
'wanted to see them break
the nine-minute barrier.'

57:28.760 --> 57:31.719
Mate, if we don't do it
less than nine minutes...

57:31.720 --> 57:33.519
Right, amber.

57:33.520 --> 57:36.360
3, 2, 1, go.

57:39.840 --> 57:42.720
Keep accelerating this bit, mate.
Keep going, keep going.

57:49.480 --> 57:51.320
Second, yes?
Second gear's good.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.240
Boot it, boot it, boot it.

57:58.360 --> 57:59.600
Nice!

58:00.560 --> 58:01.840
This is awesome!

58:09.320 --> 58:11.400
Keep going, keep going.

58:14.040 --> 58:17.479
Here he is, here he is!
Oh my God.

58:17.480 --> 58:18.920
That's it!

58:20.040 --> 58:23.279
'Sadly, they hadn't broken
that nine-minute barrier,

58:23.280 --> 58:26.559
'probably because they HAD broken
something else.'

58:26.560 --> 58:28.359
Oh, yes!

58:28.360 --> 58:30.359
Most of that will polish out.

58:30.360 --> 58:32.759
Largely, yes, largely.

58:32.760 --> 58:36.120
That's a below centre point scratch.

58:37.480 --> 58:40.519
'I really hope that these guys
do make it to the Dakar,

58:40.520 --> 58:44.280
'because on spirit alone,
they deserve to be there.'

58:46.400 --> 58:50.959
On that day I got blown up,
I never thought I'd make this stage
where I'm at now.

58:50.960 --> 58:54.439
We said this in the car before,
who'd ever have thought

58:54.440 --> 58:57.199
we'd be sat in a Wildcat on a
Sunday morning, rallying around?

58:57.200 --> 58:59.920
What an experience.

59:06.200 --> 59:11.040
You DO deserve to be in the
Wildcat on a Sunday morning.

59:12.560 --> 59:15.400
And they are
here with us tonight!

59:19.600 --> 59:21.920
Now, can I just say, really,

59:22.880 --> 59:26.879
I think everybody here will join us
in wishing you all the very best.

59:26.880 --> 59:30.799
We really do hope you make it
to the start and the finish
of the Dakar.

59:30.800 --> 59:34.720
You really do deserve it, guys.
You do deserve it.

59:38.960 --> 59:40.639
That's it!

59:40.640 --> 59:44.119
Not only for this programme,
but for this series.

59:44.120 --> 59:46.599
We'll be back whenever
the X Factor's finished.

59:46.600 --> 59:48.240
See you then, good night.
