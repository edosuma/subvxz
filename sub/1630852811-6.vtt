WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.640
Wouldn't it be funny if Adam ended
up delivering you?

00:03.640 --> 00:05.000
We're going to play it safe
and go private.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.080
It's our engagement party tonight,

00:06.080 --> 00:07.560
do you want to get a bit
more engaged?

00:07.560 --> 00:10.000
I was going to say
that my relationship is the only

00:10.000 --> 00:11.960
thing in my life that's not
totally fucked up.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.640
But now I'm not quite sure
how true that is.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.840
How are we going to make this work?
Well, we're probably not, are we?

00:17.840 --> 00:20.560
I just feel so incompetent there.
I'm lying to my parents

00:20.560 --> 00:23.120
because they are so proud of what
they think I've achieved.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.840
Where's the support?

00:24.840 --> 00:27.040
Well, it's a difficult job. What do
you want me to say, it gets easier?

00:27.040 --> 00:29.400
It doesn't. So if you can't handle
that fact,

00:29.400 --> 00:31.000
maybe you should get out now.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.000
PAINED SCREAMING IN DISTANCE

00:47.960 --> 00:50.080
You OK there?  Er...

00:50.080 --> 00:53.440
200g of goat's cheese...please.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.080
Oh, my God. Er...
You delivered our triplets.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.080
A couple of months ago,
at St Clare's.

00:59.080 --> 01:02.040
Er... No, I think
you've got me confused, sorry.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.520
Well, you're the absolute spit
of her, I'll tell you that.

01:04.520 --> 01:06.160
Um... 200g, right?

01:12.440 --> 01:14.040
It is you.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.600
Dr Shruti.

01:15.600 --> 01:16.840
I'm really not a doctor.

01:18.320 --> 01:21.080
Anyway, they're, er...they're doing
great.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.840
None of us are getting any sleep,

01:22.840 --> 01:25.080
but I guess we're not meant to,
right?

01:25.080 --> 01:26.400
COUPLE CHATTERING

01:26.400 --> 01:27.880
I've, erm...

01:27.880 --> 01:30.320
..put it through as cheddar.
Third of the price.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.880
Sorry, David, you put that
through as cheddar.

01:34.880 --> 01:38.120
Did I? Oh, I'll go and change that.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.360
# I hope you felt cheated at home

01:49.360 --> 01:52.240
# With all your lies, lies,
lies, lies, lies

01:52.240 --> 01:57.880
# How long has it taken for you to
look so fine, fine, fine, fine...? #

01:57.880 --> 01:58.920
DOOR SLAMS

02:00.400 --> 02:02.160
Oh. You're in.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.320
What a lovely surprise.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.360
Did you manage to pick up
some toilet tissue?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.880
It's just we don't usually
get through it so quickly.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.480
No, I'm sorry,
I had a really mental day.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.120
I was in theatre for seven hours.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.000
Anything disgusting?  Oh, yes.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.800
This woman was running from
the police, high as a kite,

02:18.800 --> 02:21.920
and she climbs over
some railings, slips

02:21.920 --> 02:24.000
and impales herself on a metal
spike.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.360
EMMA GROANS Up inside

02:26.360 --> 02:28.520
and right out the front
of her abdomen.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.160
Ah, sheesh!

02:30.160 --> 02:31.760
Sheesh kebab.

02:31.760 --> 02:32.960
GREG CHUCKLES

02:32.960 --> 02:36.440
EMMA GASPS
What do we put our drinks on?

02:36.440 --> 02:39.800
Sorry. I'm not used
to having nice things.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.920
They're not really your things,
are they?

02:41.920 --> 02:43.280
I'm glad that you're done.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.680
We've barely seen you
since you've been here.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.600
How long has it been now?
33 days? 34?

02:48.600 --> 02:50.280
I'll be out of your hair
in a bit.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.320
Oh! When are you moving out?

02:52.320 --> 02:54.160
No, I mean,
I have a locum shift tonight.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.800
Oh.  But it will get me
a bit closer to, er...

02:56.800 --> 02:59.240
..pulling together a deposit
for a new flat.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.840
Mate...  Well...

03:00.840 --> 03:03.000
Honestly, there's no hurry.
If it's just a few grand,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.320
maybe we could lend you the money.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.320
Oh, the shift I'm doing tonight
is at your gaff.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.480
Oh, St Agnes's?  Since when did you
start working at private hospitals?

03:10.480 --> 03:13.520
Oh, it's just one shift.
My boss put me up for it.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.800
For the money they're offering
I can, um...

03:15.800 --> 03:17.640
..sell my soul for one night.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.800
No, seriously. It really is
so much nicer there.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.360
You get what you pay for.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.320
20 grand's quite a lot
for mood lighting,

03:24.320 --> 03:26.760
smoked-salmon sandwiches
and coasters.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.760
Mate, I know
she's a strong flavour, but...

03:31.760 --> 03:33.480
Mm-hm.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.920
..can you dial it down a bit
with Emma?

03:35.920 --> 03:37.680
This is her house
as much as it is mine.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.320
She's taken you in as a guest,
which she didn't have to do.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.240
Can you...? You know?

03:42.240 --> 03:43.280
Point taken.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.680
Sorry.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.800
Just had a lot on.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.480
Are you OK?

03:55.880 --> 03:57.920
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.680
I mean, actually OK?

03:59.680 --> 04:00.840
I said I'm fine.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.480
Was that you being fine
at your engagement party?

04:04.480 --> 04:07.680
Well, in retrospect,
it wasn't an engagement party.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.720
Right.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.840
Have they given you a date yet?
For the tribunal?

04:14.840 --> 04:16.560
Is this you trying to cheer me up?

04:20.320 --> 04:23.480
If you ever want to chat
about that, or Harry,

04:23.480 --> 04:25.120
you know I'm here for you, right?

04:28.120 --> 04:30.120
You know, I've realised something.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.160
What's that?

04:32.480 --> 04:35.120
I think I'm actually designed
to be on my own.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.880
Really?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.840
Mm.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.360
I mean, c...cool, great.
Yeah, it's...

04:44.360 --> 04:47.520
..it's, I dunno,
it's freer or something.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.600
No-one asking me
how I'm feeling all the time,

04:49.600 --> 04:51.160
for a start. GREG LAUGHS

04:52.160 --> 04:54.160
Single and unwilling to mingle.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.200
If there's going to be
any "mingling",

04:58.200 --> 05:00.240
there's a mattress protector
in the wardrobe.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.320
Yeah, Dad, I'm just in the flat.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.680
MUM:  Tell her to send me that photo.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.160
Your mum said
you'd send her a photo of it.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.040
I will do.
I'm just in the dining room.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.640
Did she get her test results yet?

05:14.640 --> 05:16.400
Did you get your test results yet?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.960
No, they've not come through yet.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.840
There must have been a delay
with marking them,

05:19.840 --> 05:21.520
or the post or something.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.640
Well, we're proud of you
whatever happens.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.480
Let me speak to her.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.040
Hey, your mum wants to speak to you.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.920
Feels like I already have.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.680
Hi, Shruti.  Hi, Mum.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.400
Have you delivered
any more babies yet?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.520
I'm sure
I'll do some more tonight.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.120
Such an amazing job you do.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.840
Yeah.  Are you OK?

05:40.840 --> 05:42.600
Why don't you come up at
the weekend?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.960
You know I can't just come up.
I'm working every day

05:44.960 --> 05:46.440
for the next two weeks.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.200
We will drive down one evening.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.280
No. That's not fair on Rashmi
Auntie while she's in hospital.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.400
Look, I'm going to be late
for work.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.880
OK, well, speak to you tomorrow.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.320
Bye.

06:00.320 --> 06:03.120
Love you. Bye.  Bye.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.000
VERONIQUE:
'I'm just so proud, darling.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.320
'I'm sure it's just the start of
a burgeoning private practice.

06:20.320 --> 06:23.360
I've got one shift as a lackey
at a hoity-toity hospital.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.840
'Well, the journey of
a thousand miles begins with

06:25.840 --> 06:27.440
'a single Caesarean.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.400
'I'm so glad
you're focusing on work

06:29.400 --> 06:31.040
'and putting Henry behind you.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.600
Harry.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.040
'Are you doing OK, darling,
with all that?

06:35.040 --> 06:36.240
Yep, fine.

06:36.240 --> 06:39.120
'I knew you would. I'm glad
you've moved on quickly.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.440
'He just wasn't right for you,
was he?

06:41.440 --> 06:43.280
'Are you wearing a smart tie?

06:43.280 --> 06:45.000
Yeah, beau-di-ful.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.080
'Beau-ti-ful.
Why are you dropping your Ts?

06:47.080 --> 06:49.200
'Is that some Irish thing
you picked up?

06:49.200 --> 06:52.040
I'm here now, I'd better go.
'Remember to smile.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.800
'You look so much more handsome
when you...'

06:56.200 --> 06:57.960
PERSON YELPS Ooh!

06:57.960 --> 07:00.760
Maybe don't kneecap the consultants
before you even start.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.440
I am so sorry.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.360
LAUGHING:  Oh, it's entirely my
fault.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.200
Are you visiting a ward here?

07:06.200 --> 07:09.400
Actually, I'm here for a shift.
My name's Adam, I'm a doctor.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.520
Oh, wonderful!

07:12.040 --> 07:14.120
I'm Serena
and I'm one of the midwives.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.360
Really? Really good to meet you.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.320
Come in.  Thank you.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.560
Do mind the railings.
They've just been lacquered.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.280
# That coat that I gave you

07:28.240 --> 07:30.720
# All shiny and black

07:30.720 --> 07:33.520
CHATTER

07:33.520 --> 07:36.080
# I'm sorry, my darling

07:38.520 --> 07:41.080
# But I'm taking it back

07:44.280 --> 07:46.880
# I don't want to spoil the party

07:49.680 --> 07:52.800
# But I've got to go home

07:52.800 --> 07:54.960
Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.680
# You can stay if you want to... #

08:00.520 --> 08:03.720
Hi. Do we normally do tours
for new mums at eight at night?

08:03.720 --> 08:06.160
Ha! No, that's the queue
for triage. Good luck.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.400
Here, how many night shifts
do you have left?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.800
Er... Oh, it's last one tonight.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.240
See you Monday, then, pet.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.720
I've...taken a couple of weeks
of leave, actually.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.080
Ah, well.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.440
Don't do anything I would.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.040
I don't know why
there's so many of them.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.560
They all had sex nine months ago?
Something's going to go wrong.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.400
I can just feel it.
That's the spirit.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.840
Who's the registrar tonight?

08:32.840 --> 08:35.280
It was meant to be a locum
but no-one's turned up yet.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.520
I said something
was going to go wrong.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.800
OK. Er, well, you get onto
the agency and I'll get cracking.

08:40.800 --> 08:43.320
Is there anyone you're
particularly worried about?

08:43.320 --> 08:44.480
Er...

08:45.880 --> 08:48.320
I'm worried about all of them,
to be honest with you.

08:48.320 --> 08:52.040
Course you are. Well, I will
be in triage if you need me.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.280
I'm not happy about only
having one doctor here.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.240
I'm trying Adam. PHONE RINGS OUT

08:56.240 --> 08:57.280
ADAM: 'Hello.'

08:57.280 --> 08:59.720
Oh, hi, Adam, you're not free
for a shift tonight, are you?

08:59.720 --> 09:02.400
I'm not. Why don't you see if
Pippa's ava...

09:02.400 --> 09:04.320
SHRUTI HANGS UP

09:04.320 --> 09:07.240
Oh! Sorry, one more thing.  What?

09:07.240 --> 09:09.160
There's an active shooter
in the building?

09:09.160 --> 09:10.360
Is the coffee room on fire?

09:10.360 --> 09:13.960
One of next month's SHOs
is on orientation tonight,

09:13.960 --> 09:16.440
if you wouldn't mind
showing him the ropes?

09:16.440 --> 09:17.960
Pew-pew-pew!

09:17.960 --> 09:20.240
MIMICS LASER GUNS

09:20.240 --> 09:21.840
The more the merrier.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.880
Hi, I'm Shruti.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.600
Are you one of the midwives, love?

09:28.600 --> 09:30.480
I'm your boss, love.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.840
Oh.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.200
I'm Al, by the way.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.160
Er...where are we going?

09:38.160 --> 09:41.400
So this is the main floor.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.520
We've got four rooms
and ten midwives.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.920
Four midwives and ten rooms.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.800
Oh, you mean that, sorry.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.440
Uh...that is the large
hydrotherapy pool.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.920
That is the mother and baby
sensory centre.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.000
This is a standard room.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.480
The beds are Californian

10:03.480 --> 10:05.840
with a breathable
12-zone mattress, balcony,

10:05.840 --> 10:08.640
dressing area, office suite
and waterfall shower.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.720
Holy shit. HE LAUGHS

10:12.720 --> 10:14.720
Right.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.880
Do you mostly work in
the maintained sector?

10:17.880 --> 10:19.200
STRAINED: Mm.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.800
Ah! You have
a nightclub here too?

10:21.800 --> 10:24.600
Ah! No, some minor royal

10:24.600 --> 10:26.880
and they've block-booked
half the ward.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.600
Means that we won't be quite
as busy as usual.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.480
So why don't you get yourself
changed

10:32.480 --> 10:34.840

to the patient?

10:38.160 --> 10:39.400

10:57.720 --> 10:59.800

11:08.160 --> 11:10.760

Never really understood
why people have

12:01.360 --> 12:03.040
doctor and nurse fetishes
before now.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.960

My vagina's totally fallen out.'

12:53.000 --> 12:55.160
Oh, er... O...OK, madam,

12:55.160 --> 12:56.840
can you describe what's happening?

12:56.840 --> 12:59.800
I'm just pulling your perineum.
It's Vicky Houghton.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.800
Oh, hi. Um...it's Shruti.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.720
MIMICKING TRACE:  I've had
old worry-warts on the line

13:05.720 --> 13:08.360
saying that the agency hasn't
come through with a registrar.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.600
Yeah, I'm sorry about this,
I was wondering if you might

13:10.600 --> 13:12.200
be able to come in.
Yeah, course, love.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.680
See a few patients in triage
for you, maybe?

13:14.680 --> 13:15.960
Yeah, if you don't mind?

13:15.960 --> 13:17.560
Wipe the shit from your arse?

13:17.560 --> 13:19.680
Erm... No, I...

13:19.680 --> 13:21.960
I'll be over in a flash
if it all goes to balls,

13:21.960 --> 13:23.360

13:24.640 --> 13:26.880

'You'll ace it, mate, OK?'

13:29.840 --> 13:31.800
Yeah, I will give you a yell
if anything...

13:40.600 --> 13:42.240

13:48.640 --> 13:52.040
Why don't you pop your head
inside Princess Anne?

13:52.040 --> 13:53.320
Excuse me?

13:53.320 --> 13:55.520
Say hi to the lady
in the Princess Anne Suite.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.520
Patient of Nigel Lockhart's,
uncomplicated first pregnancy,

13:58.520 --> 14:01.840
cracking along nicely at
six centimetres, good epidural.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.720
Sure.

14:06.120 --> 14:09.320
And, er, they'll send dinner
to your room in about an hour.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.160
It's asparagus risotto today.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.440
Really?

14:12.440 --> 14:14.200
I know. It's barely in season.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.400
But somebody's already had
a word with the kitchen.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.960
HE CLEARS THROAT

14:24.960 --> 14:26.560
QUIETLY: Mrs Mullender.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.680
Good evening, Mrs Mullender.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.880
Come.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.200
Mrs Mullender?

14:33.800 --> 14:35.400
Miss. How can I help?

14:35.400 --> 14:38.280
Sorry. My name's Adam,
I'm one of the doctors.

14:38.280 --> 14:41.520
I thought I'd just swing by
and see... Ah!

14:41.520 --> 14:42.560
Are you Daddy?

14:42.560 --> 14:44.320
SHE SNORTS WITH LAUGHTER
Are you joking?

14:44.320 --> 14:46.320
Do you want me to serve up?

14:46.320 --> 14:47.840
No, leave it there, thank you.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.040
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to assume.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.520
There's no daddy.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.200
And I've just spent a full week
convincing my sister-in-law

14:57.200 --> 14:59.720
that she doesn't need to sit
with me and mop my brow.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.520
It's not like I'd invite her
along to a dental extraction.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.360
SHE LAUGHS

15:04.360 --> 15:06.840
We basically use the same
equipment, to be fair.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.480
I mean, what does she think
we'd even talk about?

15:10.480 --> 15:13.760
Pretty sure I don't have eight hours
of polite chit-chat in me, anyway.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.360
I was literally saying the exact
same thing earlier today.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.240
What's wrong with spending
a bit of time with yourself?

15:19.240 --> 15:22.360
Mm.  I think we're groomed

15:22.360 --> 15:24.400
by society to believe
you're dysfunctional

15:24.400 --> 15:25.800
if you're not constantly...

15:25.800 --> 15:27.880
Like I say, I don't have
eight hours of chit-chat in me.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.040
Yes, right.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.040
Um, well, give me a shout
if you need anything.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.080
Erm...

15:35.400 --> 15:37.520
I've got some asparagus
to deal with.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.680
Right. In July?!

15:42.600 --> 15:44.600
AL: Oh, bleeds a lot, doesn't it?

human flesh with a knife?

15:47.600 --> 15:49.040
Hold that there for me.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.520
What's that instrument called?

15:52.520 --> 15:55.120
It's called the
"shut up for a minute

15:55.120 --> 15:56.480
"and let me operate".

15:56.480 --> 15:57.960

15:57.960 --> 16:01.040

16:13.960 --> 16:15.800

16:15.800 --> 16:17.400
Oh, thanks.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.480
And what's this layer called?

16:19.480 --> 16:22.160
Looks like a two-day-old kebab,
to be honest.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.680
It's the rectus abdomini.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.200
Ugh, smells like
an old kebab now too.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.440
Right, get your other hand
in there and pull.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.800
NURSE:  Do you like to give
antibiotics at your sections?

16:33.800 --> 16:36.280
No, thanks. What's this bit?

16:36.280 --> 16:38.240
I want to say the bowel?

16:38.240 --> 16:41.200
Do you want to say
the uterus instead? You know,

16:41.200 --> 16:43.000
when a mummy and daddy
love each other very much?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.800
Oh, yeah, I think I've seen
some videos

16:44.800 --> 16:46.040
about that on the internet.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.560
OK, make the incision

17:03.200 --> 17:06.920
Deliver the first shoulder

in there?

I mean, the feeling of...

17:26.360 --> 17:28.600
I guess it just never gets old,
does it?

17:28.600 --> 17:31.400
Once you've seen one baby,
you've kind of seen them all.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.480
That's a bit enthusiastic.
Can we get suction,

17:35.480 --> 17:37.920

21:53.160 --> 21:55.160
drop them over at Greg's tomorrow?

21:55.160 --> 21:58.200
Kenzie's off work and his car's
back from the garage, so...

21:58.200 --> 22:00.080
HE LAUGHS FLATLY

22:00.080 --> 22:02.080
He didn't hang around, did he?

22:02.080 --> 22:04.280
'What's that supposed to mean?'

22:04.280 --> 22:06.640
I guess I should be grateful
he waited until my cock

22:06.640 --> 22:08.520
was actually out of you
before he pounced.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.720
You done yet?

22:11.720 --> 22:14.080
HE SIGHS SHARPLY

22:14.080 --> 22:16.680
I'll check with Greg what time
I can bring them over.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.200
This is fucking ridiculous.

22:32.200 --> 22:35.920
Thanks so much for coming down.
How's it going on labour ward?

22:35.920 --> 22:37.680
Tell me about the patient.
Right. Well,

22:37.680 --> 22:40.280
we've been on the phone to
the telephone interpreter service

22:40.280 --> 22:42.960
for half an hour now but
we're really not getting anywhere.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.480
I think he lied on his CV when
he said he could speak Hindi.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.960
All we know is
they're bleeding down below

22:47.960 --> 22:49.480
and they're a hermaphrodite.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.120
Yeah, we say intersex.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.800
Yeah, I'd hate to prejudge

22:54.800 --> 22:56.920
but I'd be really surprised
if he was intersex.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.120
How do you know?

22:58.120 --> 23:00.320
The same way I know he's not
a kestrel.

23:00.320 --> 23:03.400
Look, it's clearly not androgen
insensitivity syndrome,

23:03.400 --> 23:06.000
so it's got to be Klinefelter's
or de la Chapelle syndrome,

23:06.000 --> 23:07.320
but given his...

23:07.320 --> 23:09.080
Don't worry, I'll speak to him.

23:30.640 --> 23:31.880
HE CHUCKLES

23:37.200 --> 23:39.480
Not a hermaphrodite.  Haemophiliac.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.120
PAGER BEEPS AND BUZZES

24:06.200 --> 24:07.680
KNOCK ON DOOR Hello?

24:07.680 --> 24:08.760
DOOR OPENS

24:09.920 --> 24:11.240
Not seen you here before.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.200
I was hoping you'd forgotten

24:13.200 --> 24:15.280
that I mistook you
for a patient's husband.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.040
Oh, no, I meant...  I know.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.400
It's my first shift here.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.320
Well, you're a very
welcome addition.

24:25.440 --> 24:29.440
I normally work for the NHS,
where we don't get any, um...

24:29.440 --> 24:32.520
They're called cloches.
I meant food.

24:32.520 --> 24:33.640
Oh.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.400
Sorry if I've judged
this wrong, but...

24:37.400 --> 24:39.040
..do you fancy
getting a drink one day?

24:39.040 --> 24:40.840
I...

24:40.840 --> 24:42.520
Um...

24:42.520 --> 24:45.680
H-How...? Why...? Why did you...?
Why'd you think...?

24:45.680 --> 24:48.680
Well, it's normally a clue
when boys call me Daddy.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.200
So?

24:54.200 --> 24:57.240
I'm not really looking
for a relationship.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.640
That's handy. I'm not offering one.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.720
BOTH PANT AND MOAN

25:05.720 --> 25:09.280
Call me Daddy. Call me Daddy!

25:12.560 --> 25:17.480
PHONE RINGS

25:21.680 --> 25:23.120
Hello?

25:23.120 --> 25:24.920
'It's Serena. Can you come down?

25:26.240 --> 25:29.520
Yes, of course. Um...what's up?

25:29.520 --> 25:31.000
'I need you to
chuck on some gloves

25:31.000 --> 25:32.920
'and get inside Princess Anne.'

25:32.920 --> 25:34.600
The patient's been pushing
for an hour,

25:34.600 --> 25:37.080
CTG's not great, so you
should probably deliver her.

25:37.080 --> 25:38.240
Right away.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.160
I've got nothing on my hands
at the moment, so...

25:48.920 --> 25:52.520
Not sure I've ever delivered
a baby with a semi before.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.840
Yeah, I know, Trace,
it must be very worrying

25:54.840 --> 25:56.160
not having a doctor there.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.640
Yeah, I realise any
of those things could happen,

25:58.640 --> 26:01.760
I'm just dealing with something
that actually is happening.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.760
VOMITING AND COUGHING

26:03.760 --> 26:06.080
OK, look, there's
one more patient left in A&E,

26:06.080 --> 26:07.320
then I'll be right up.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.360
Briana "Dal-ziel"?  Yes.

26:17.360 --> 26:19.840
It's "Dee-ell", and we've been
waiting here 3.5 hours.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.920
Dad!  Yeah, sorry about that,
it's been manic today.

26:22.920 --> 26:26.320
Er, OK, so you had a positive
pregnancy test two weeks ago,

26:26.320 --> 26:28.240
and now you've got some pain
in your right groin?

26:28.240 --> 26:30.560
That's right.  How many people do we
have to go through this with?

26:30.560 --> 26:32.080
I'm just doing my job, sir.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.160
Do you mind if I put
a hand on your tummy?

26:38.240 --> 26:39.400
Oh!

26:39.400 --> 26:42.200
OK, I'm going to need to exclude
what's called an ectopic pregnancy.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.720
That's when a pregnancy implants
in a tube

26:44.720 --> 26:47.000
which can potentially rupture,
cause a bit of an emergency.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.600
She's been waiting here
all bloody night

26:48.600 --> 26:50.520
and now you're telling us
it's an emergency?

26:50.520 --> 26:52.560
No, I'm saying I need to make
sure it's not an emergency

26:52.560 --> 26:54.640
before I send you home,
which means doing a scan.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.120
And how long's that going to take?

26:56.120 --> 26:57.880
I pay your wages, you know.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.440
Can I have a raise, then?

26:59.440 --> 27:01.480
It takes as long as it takes, Dad.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.960
There isn't any out-of-hours
scanning, I'm afraid.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.400
Oh, for God's sake!

27:05.400 --> 27:07.480
Which means I'll need
to keep you in overnight

27:07.480 --> 27:09.480
and do it in the morning.
Fucking NHS.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.200
Dad.  I'm taking you home. Come on,
we've been here long enough.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.240
Dad!
Wait.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.560
Maybe there is something I can do.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.800
Yeah, I just didn't expect
to pay 15 grand

27:20.800 --> 27:23.440
to have the work experience
deliver me, Nigel.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.320
SHE SIGHS

27:25.320 --> 27:27.880
No. I do, I do, I understand.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.520
Absolutely.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.720
I'll see you in the...

27:31.720 --> 27:33.440
We will see you in the morning.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.720
Will do. All right, thanks.
Give it to him.

27:37.720 --> 27:38.760
Oh.

27:39.920 --> 27:40.960
Er...

27:40.960 --> 27:43.640
Evening, Kay. Sorry for
dumping you in it a bit.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.360
Oh, it's not a problem, Mr Lockhart.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.120
Yeah, she's nice enough
when you get to know her.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.160
Just get on with it.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.360
Smile like the Cheshire Cat
on nitrous oxide.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.240
I've told her you're my best guy.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.000
Thank you, that means a lot.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah, then again, I told her
I was stuck in traffic,

27:56.000 --> 27:57.880
so take that with a pinch of salt.

27:57.880 --> 28:00.560
I'll-I'll bung you a grand
for your efforts.

28:00.560 --> 28:03.960
That's...extremely kind,
Mr Lockhart. Thank you.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.880
Oh, and I'm going to be
stuck in traffic

28:05.880 --> 28:09.440
for a fortnight in Corfu next month,
if you're interested.

28:09.440 --> 28:10.680
So don't fuck it up.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.200
CALL DISCONNECTS

28:14.560 --> 28:15.920
Thank you.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.040
I'm so sorry you've ended up
with the B-Team.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.840
Sometimes things
just happen too quickly

28:19.840 --> 28:21.040
to get the consultant in.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.480
No. Course.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.600
I'm just grateful
you're one of Nigel's guys,

28:24.600 --> 28:26.040
not some flunky in the NHS.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.640
THEY LAUGH

28:27.640 --> 28:28.880
I just don't think

28:28.880 --> 28:31.840
I'm a "having a baby in a corridor"
kind of person.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.640
You made the right decision
coming here, that's for sure.

28:37.160 --> 28:38.200
Well, wouldn't you?

28:39.440 --> 28:42.000
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

28:43.840 --> 28:46.320
Nearly there.
You're doing really well.

28:46.320 --> 28:49.440
We'll find out what's going on
in a second, OK?

28:49.440 --> 28:51.840
Um, it's usually all locked up
this time of night,

28:51.840 --> 28:53.880
but there's an ultrasound
machine free in here,

28:53.880 --> 28:55.320
so we can... SENSOR BEEPS

28:56.800 --> 28:58.280
SENSOR CHIRRUPS

28:58.280 --> 29:01.520
Oh, um...there's a man asleep
in there, by the way, but...

29:01.520 --> 29:03.280
Shit!  Get up.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.360
What...?

29:08.800 --> 29:10.760
No offence,
but you do not look well.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.560
BRIANA GROANS

29:18.160 --> 29:19.400
Let's have a quick look.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.680
Right.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.040
I can see a lot of blood
in your abdomen.

29:30.040 --> 29:32.920
That means that your pregnancy
is ectopic, and it's ruptured.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.520
Fucking hell!  Al. Please.
It's fine, she's asleep.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.600
Briana? Shit.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.560
Right, Al, listen to me carefully

29:42.560 --> 29:43.920
or this woman is going to die.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.880
Use the phone outside
to fast-bleep theatres

29:45.880 --> 29:47.000
to say we're coming over,

29:47.000 --> 29:48.920
then call Ms Houghton
to come in urgently.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.000
Do you understand?  I think so.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.240
OK. Quickly go!

29:53.680 --> 29:57.160
Get me some Venflons
and some giving sets.

30:01.480 --> 30:04.360
Briana? Briana, stay with me.
You're going to be fine.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.640
SHE SCREAMS

30:10.640 --> 30:11.680
That's it.

30:12.840 --> 30:15.200
OK, and stop pushing and pant
for me.

30:15.200 --> 30:18.560
SHE PANTS

30:18.560 --> 30:20.320
NURSE:  Keep going.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.960
Fabulous, well done.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.360
Beautiful baby...

30:26.360 --> 30:28.720
..girl! HE CHUCKLES

30:28.720 --> 30:30.480
GURGLING CRY

30:30.480 --> 30:31.840
Hello.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.000
That's what I call
a Hollywood delivery.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.360
We got it on the first take.

30:38.960 --> 30:41.680
That's it, that's it,
that's it. Lovely.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.200
CAMERA CLICKS Say, "Roquefort"!

30:44.200 --> 30:45.880
Gynae theatre's fifth floor.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.680
And they know we're coming?  Yeah.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.000
She's going to make it, right?
Just hurry.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.200
Go get the door.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.560
Hurry up!

30:58.720 --> 31:00.240
I meant press the...

31:00.240 --> 31:02.080
LOCK CLICKS

31:02.080 --> 31:03.440
Oh.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.480
Right. Well, that's me done.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.320
You got away without so much
as a tear. It's really good.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.760
You OK up there?

31:14.760 --> 31:17.440
BABY CRIES Hm? Yeah. I think so.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.720
"Think"...?

31:21.640 --> 31:24.360
Jesus Christ.
That's like a litre of the stuff.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.640
Time to earn my money.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.040
Um, you're losing
a bit of blood there.

31:28.040 --> 31:31.320
Apologies if it gets a bit busy here
while we sort you out.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.280
One litre PPH and counting.  Right.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.240
Pull the emergency cord
and get the cavalry in.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.800
Take the baby off her.
Get some monitoring going.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.280
Lie her flat. High-flow oxygen.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.720
Get me a couple
of wide-bore cannulas.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.680
MONITORS BEEP

31:45.680 --> 31:48.160
Very atonic uterus.
Let's get a catheter in,

31:48.160 --> 31:50.640
draw up Syntometrine, and
get a Synto infusion running.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.080
I'll get the Synto infusion.  This?

31:53.080 --> 31:55.080
No, not nasal prongs.
I need a high-flow oxygen mask.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.520
And an adult-size cannula.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.600
I'll get the cannula.  I'll do it.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.680
Right, you look for some
Syntometrine. It's usually

32:00.680 --> 32:02.680
here in the second drawer.
How hard was that?

32:04.480 --> 32:06.600
Someone take over the fundal
massage.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.080
PATIENT BREATHES HEAVILY

32:08.080 --> 32:09.680
Don't worry, Kathleen.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.560
Get some Carboprost
and Misoprostol ready for me.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.520
I'm not sure
if we have any of them.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.760
Course you do. You must do.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.840
KATHLEEN MOANS

32:17.840 --> 32:19.760
Where are the doctors?
I need doctors.

32:19.760 --> 32:22.120
Inform haematology,
a couple of anaesthetists

32:22.120 --> 32:23.960
and let interventional
radiology know

32:23.960 --> 32:26.080
that we might need them.
Our anaesthetist is on his way,

32:26.080 --> 32:27.640
but there aren't any
of those other ones here.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.680
Get Mr Lockhart on the phone now.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.000
I need six units of O negative

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
before the crossmatched blood
is available.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.200
We only keep two units here.
I need six units of blood,

32:37.200 --> 32:40.120
I'm not negotiating a discount
on bathroom tiles here.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.720
KATHLEEN GASPS

32:41.720 --> 32:43.800
Could someone call my brother,
please?

32:43.800 --> 32:45.880
That's a lot of blood
we're chucking in.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.440
Be good if we could start?

32:47.440 --> 32:49.560
I'm just the SHO.
I've not done it before.

32:49.560 --> 32:50.840
I've not even seen it before.

32:50.840 --> 32:52.280
Didn't you say we need to operate
now?

32:52.280 --> 32:54.280
I mean my consultant needs to
do it. She's nearly here -

32:54.280 --> 32:56.520
she was just around the corner
two minutes ago.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.640
Just like a cab is always
round the corner?

32:59.960 --> 33:01.360
Labour ward are on the phone.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.640
They've got a massive
post-partum haemorrhage

33:03.640 --> 33:04.680
coming over in an ambulance.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.160
Well, I can only be
in one theatre at once.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.760
Shall I go there?

33:07.760 --> 33:10.200
And do what? Faint?  What? No.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.880
That was just a blood sugar thing.
What do you want me to tell them?

33:12.880 --> 33:15.200
I can't leave
until Ms Houghton's here.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.560
I could have a go.

33:27.720 --> 33:28.760
Scalpel, please.

33:33.880 --> 33:34.920
Here we go.

33:37.520 --> 33:38.800
Fucking doors!

33:38.800 --> 33:42.760
Stood there banging for five minutes
before a cleaner found me.

33:42.760 --> 33:46.120
Even fucking Cinderella got back
through the door after midnight.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.080
We got stuck in a corridor too.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.880
Wow. That's a great story.

33:50.880 --> 33:53.520
Well, we're all here now.
Remind me.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.440
32 years old, confirmed ruptured
ectopic

33:56.440 --> 33:58.240
with significant peritoneal
bleeding.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.040
You scanned her yourself?  Yeah.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.560
Fuck me with forceps!
You are stepping up.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.760
There's an ambulance transfer
coming into labour ward,

34:04.760 --> 34:06.040
so you stay here and do this.

34:06.040 --> 34:09.160
I'm going to go and sort that out.
Will do, boss.

34:09.160 --> 34:11.640
I'll crack on here, then.
She'll be right as rain.

34:12.920 --> 34:16.240
# Stay out super late tonight

34:16.240 --> 34:18.960
# Picking apples, making pies

34:18.960 --> 34:23.520
# Put a little something
in our lemonade

34:23.520 --> 34:25.480
# And take it with us

34:25.480 --> 34:28.240
# We're half awake... #

34:28.240 --> 34:30.720
Major PPH. Lost three litres or so.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.840
Delivered an hour ago at St Agnes.

34:32.840 --> 34:35.120
Er, how many units has she had?

34:35.120 --> 34:37.120
Two at the hospital,
one in the ambulance.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.840
Three, two, one.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.080
Thank you.

34:45.200 --> 34:47.840
She's very tachy. Let's hook her up
to a couple

34:47.840 --> 34:49.080
more bottles of house red.

34:49.080 --> 34:51.440
Are you happy to scribe?  Sure.

34:51.440 --> 34:53.280
Tracy, bleep the
on-call haematologist,

34:53.280 --> 34:55.800
we need to discuss plasma
and cryo and all that.

34:55.800 --> 34:56.840
Right.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.320
What's she had
in the way of uterotonics?

35:00.320 --> 35:02.680
Just Syntometrine, and the Synto
infusion that's running.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.360
Want to give her some Misoprostol?

35:04.360 --> 35:06.040
Protocol is Carboprost first.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.600
Carboprost!

35:07.600 --> 35:09.400
Good point.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.880
Right, let's get her legs up.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.120
I'm going to run through
the four Ts.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.000
Tone. Uterus is boggy.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.440
Er, she's had Syntometrine,

35:17.440 --> 35:20.480
a Synto infusion is running
and she's having Carboprost.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.520
Tissue. Was the placenta complete?

35:22.520 --> 35:25.440
Yes.  Trauma. Any tears?  No.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.960
Thrombin. Any pertinent history?
Um...nothing.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.680
Right, make sure to send a clotting.

35:30.680 --> 35:33.480
Done. That's in, and blood running.

35:35.120 --> 35:38.200
# Turn the light out, say goodnight

35:38.200 --> 35:41.280
# No thinking for a little while

35:42.800 --> 35:45.640
# Let's not try to figure out

35:45.640 --> 35:48.200
# Everything at once

35:48.200 --> 35:53.560
# We're half awake in
a fake empire. #

36:00.320 --> 36:03.600
Yet another transfer
from St Hopeless.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.080
Mm.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.600
One day they're going to
kill someone, you know?

36:07.600 --> 36:09.640
It's a shame we don't see
any of the cash

36:09.640 --> 36:11.840
those poor patients spend.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.560
SHE TUTS

36:21.960 --> 36:24.800
Nice work tonight, by the way.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.480
Ms Houghton's basically, er,

36:26.480 --> 36:28.960
writing a four-act opera
about how great you are.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.520
Is it wrong for me to feel proud?

36:41.720 --> 36:44.680
You're so...good.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.640
Mm-hm.

36:50.480 --> 36:53.600
You still pissed off with me?
About the engagement party?

36:53.600 --> 36:55.040
No, I'm just tired.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.640
I really am sorry.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.320
It's fine.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.960
Anyway, you're only as good as
your last patient, aren't you?

37:00.960 --> 37:02.000
I bloody hope not.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.960
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry,
I completely forgot.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.200
Exam results were out yesterday.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.520
Yeah.

37:16.720 --> 37:18.040
And...?

37:20.280 --> 37:21.960
I passed.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.360
That's amazing, Shruts. Well done.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.240
I mean, obviously you did. HE CHUCKLES

37:29.560 --> 37:33.000
Well...we need to celebrate.
What you doing tomorrow night?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.080
I'm off after nights.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.680
Well, whenever, you know.
The offer's there.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.840
Well...enjoy your break...

37:48.000 --> 37:50.520
..and see you soon
for the next instalment.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.200
Yeah, I'll see ya.

37:52.200 --> 37:53.520
See ya. Kay?

37:59.240 --> 38:01.840
I'm sorry. I really did try.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.840
Didn't we say no feet
on the table, Adam?

38:37.040 --> 38:40.400
So, how was
your first private shift?

38:42.080 --> 38:43.640
Yeah, it was fine, thanks.

38:45.280 --> 38:48.000
Isn't that chandelier
in the entrance hall stunning?

38:52.800 --> 38:55.280
You know, it wasn't all right,
it was awful.

38:57.280 --> 39:00.200
Attempted murder with a side
order of asparagus risotto.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.320
LAUGHING:  What do you mean?

39:05.680 --> 39:07.680
Look, you don't have to listen to me

39:07.680 --> 39:11.560
and you probably won't,
but I have to say this.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.040
Go private for your bunions
or your haemorrhoids.

39:14.040 --> 39:16.040
But not for your baby,
it's not safe.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.840
Don't be ridiculous.

39:19.840 --> 39:24.120
Yes, they've got fancy uniforms
and a pillow menu.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.280
But do you really
want that chandelier

39:26.280 --> 39:27.440
to be the last thing you see

39:27.440 --> 39:30.360
before they cart you off
for the NHS to save your life?

39:30.360 --> 39:32.200
That hospital was not prepared,

39:32.200 --> 39:34.560
and my patient nearly died
last night.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.480
You serious?  Absolutely.

39:37.920 --> 39:41.360
Save your money.
Spend it on, like, 20 holidays.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.160
Thank you, Adam.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.960
I really appreciate your honesty.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.280
Come on.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.680
THEY LAUGH

39:55.680 --> 39:57.080
Oh!

39:58.720 --> 40:00.680
Although it'd be two holidays.

40:00.680 --> 40:04.200
Or one proper summer one.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.280
Whoopsie.

40:29.320 --> 40:30.960
SENSOR BEEPS

40:32.320 --> 40:34.440
Ah, the fragrant air
of underfunding.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.320
What's going on? What's happened?

41:10.320 --> 41:11.480
Tracy?

41:18.240 --> 41:19.360
Adam, er...

41:22.400 --> 41:25.120
TEARFULLY:  ..I don't know
what she was thinking.

41:27.560 --> 41:28.640
What?

41:47.800 --> 41:52.080
RINGING TONE

41:52.080 --> 41:53.920
'Hey, it's Harry.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.760
'I can't take your call right now,
but leave a message...'

42:07.760 --> 42:09.240
HE SIGHS

42:23.560 --> 42:26.600
HE SOBS
