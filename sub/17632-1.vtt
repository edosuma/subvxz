# Carry on, Cowboy

00:20.360 --> 00:24.399
# For to ride the range you love

00:24.560 --> 00:29.429
# Across the wide prairie

00:29.440 --> 00:33.558
# With the burning sun above

00:33.600 --> 00:38.435
# Till you hang up your saddle

00:38.480 --> 00:41.597
# Lay down your gun

00:42.600 --> 00:47.390
# Till the last stray's been branded

00:47.400 --> 00:51.393
# Oh, Cowboy, carry on

00:52.440 --> 00:55.477
# Trails where the sage is blowin'

00:56.560 --> 01:00.394
# I'd see the prairie sky

01:01.400 --> 01:04.516
# Dust from the campfires glowin'

01:05.519 --> 01:09.559
# Dogies sing your lullaby

01:09.560 --> 01:14.429
# With your pinto to carry you

01:14.480 --> 01:18.519
# Till the last great round-up's done

01:18.560 --> 01:22.553
# Carry on, Cowboy

01:22.600 --> 01:27.469
# Oh, Cowboy, carry on

(Dramatic soundtrack music)

02:29.520 --> 02:31.511
(Horse whinnies)

02:34.560 --> 02:36.596
(Texan drawl) I wonder what they wanted.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.556
What the...? Ah, business.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.398
Take good care of 'em, mister.
They were good friends of mine.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.391
It'll be a pleasure, sir.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.432
What do you want?
Plain coffin, one dollar. Padded, two dollars.

02:55.480 --> 03:00.554
Maybe you'd like pillows,
beautiful silver handles? All the trimmings.

03:00.560 --> 03:04.348
- But...that'll be an extra two dollars.
- Give 'em pads...

03:04.400 --> 03:05.469
- Pads.
- ..pillows...

03:05.480 --> 03:06.549
- Pillows.
- ..handles...

03:06.600 --> 03:08.397
Handles.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.436
- And some flowers.
- Flowers?

03:10.480 --> 03:12.596
Pansies.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.516
Hold it a minute, Russ.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.597
- What's the matter, Judge?
- I thought I heard shots just now.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.558
Nah. It's probably just a horse backfiring.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.511
Oh, yes.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.433
Hey, wait a minute.
I know a horse backfiring when I hear one.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.393
Come now, Judge,
there ain't been no shootin' in Stodge

03:32.440 --> 03:35.398
since the day you ran Jessie James out of town.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.510
- What a day that was, eh?
- Hey-hey.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.516
You know, Judge, I never credited you

03:39.520 --> 03:42.432
with either the guts or the courage
to do a thing like that.

03:42.480 --> 03:46.598
Oh, I don't know. I didn't like having
to get tough with Jessie, though.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.353
She was a nice girl.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.597
I never did get to know
exactly what she done that was so wrong?

03:52.600 --> 03:57.515
Old Ben was a friend of mine, Sam,
and she killed him.

03:57.560 --> 04:01.519
It was his own fault. He was 92.
I warned him not to marry her.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.511
(Laughter)

04:03.520 --> 04:06.432
How she did it was immaterial.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.519
Come on. Let's get back to the game.
It's your draw, Judge.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.391
Someone's dropped one.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.510
Eh?
- Oh, it's me .

04:15.600 --> 04:17.430
I've got it.

04:17.440 --> 04:21.399
Mrs Bun, the Baker. Happy Families.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.398
That's another pot I've won.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.512
Heh-heh. Oh, and mighty purty it is too.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.556
That one's gonna take a lot of timber.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.432
Six and seven-eighths. Business is picking up.

04:45.440 --> 04:49.479
Yup, I reckon we've come far enough, old pal.
Time to rest up.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.591
Howdy, stranger!

04:59.600 --> 05:01.556
- <i>Nice day</i>.
- (Spittoon dings)

05:01.600 --> 05:03.556
Disgusting.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.559
Remind me to put up a notice about that -
"No Spitting".

05:07.560 --> 05:09.391
Yeah. Yeah, sure, Judge.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.431
PIANO: # My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean

05:13.560 --> 05:16.438
What'll it be?
Lemonade, ginger beer, sarsaparilla?

05:16.440 --> 05:17.555
Don't be funny. Whisky.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.388
We're don't serve hard stuff in Stodge, sir.
Mayor's orders.

05:21.440 --> 05:26.355
That is correct. But I can thoroughly
recommend the ginger beer.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.391
Don't you talk to me about ginger beer.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.352
- Who is this?
- Judge Burke.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.549
I am the Mayor.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.552
Better keep away from my horse.
He ain't seen a mare in three weeks.

05:36.560 --> 05:40.519
- Come on. Whisky.
- Certainly not. We are fully temperance.

05:40.520 --> 05:44.479
I don't care if you're full of flatulence.
I've been on the trail six days non-stop.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.431
I can't help that.

05:46.480 --> 05:50.393
- I don't like people who get in my way.
- I can't help that.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.391
And I just shot three men who did.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.517
I... Oh, well, in that case,
perhaps just a little one.

05:55.560 --> 05:59.553
They keep a bottle or two for me -
for purely medicinal purposes, of course.

05:59.600 --> 06:03.513
- Leave the bottle.
- Oh, I say, I can't have that.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.509
(Piano stops)

06:17.520 --> 06:18.555
<i>Bottoms up</i>.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.437
(Gunshot)

06:21.480 --> 06:23.436
# Honky-tonk piano

06:33.480 --> 06:35.516
(Growls)

06:44.520 --> 06:47.432
- I'll just take that gun of yours, cowboy.
- What for?

06:47.440 --> 06:49.396
I don't allow no shootin' at my place.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.510
Lady, I wouldn't dream of shootin' at your place.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.476
I'm not afraid to use this, you know.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.475
My, but you've got a big one.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.353
I'm from Texas, ma'am.
We all got big ones down there.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.469
And the other. Hand it over.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.476
I'll take those, Belle.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.516
Check them, will you, Charlie?

07:04.560 --> 07:09.350
Thank you. Here's your ticket. You can have
them back when you're ready to leave.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.549
I ain't leaving for a while.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.354
Oh, that's nice.
We could do with a bit of fun round here.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.598
- So you're Belle?
- My intimate friends call me...Ding Dong.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.511
Like to give you a clang some time.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.556
How about letting me have a couple of rooms?

07:23.560 --> 07:26.438
$10 a day...all in. OK?

07:26.480 --> 07:30.598
Oh, no. I'm sorry, Belle,
I can't have him staying in Stodge City.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.398
<i>Now, listen here, my good man</i>.

07:33.440 --> 07:37.479
I run this town
and I can't have any trouble around here.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.358
- You won't have to worry about that.
- I won't?

07:40.400 --> 07:41.549
From now on, I'll be running it.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.357
Yes...

07:43.400 --> 07:44.515
Come on. I'll show you your rooms.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.552
- Do you mind putting that away first?
- Oh, why, sure.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.477
Wow. What a holster.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.436
Disgusting.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.397
I'm gonna get the Sheriff.

08:03.480 --> 08:07.393
How about that ? Three all at once.
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus?

08:07.440 --> 08:10.512
It's a disgrace.
What's the use of me putting these notices up?

08:10.560 --> 08:15.588
Where's the Sheriff? What's he doing?
Earp! Earp! Sheriff!

08:16.520 --> 08:18.351
Sheriff!

08:18.400 --> 08:19.549
Oh, there you are, Earp.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.551
Wake up. There's been a shooting.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.513
It's all right. It's all right.
Don't go mad. It's only me - Judge Burke.

08:27.560 --> 08:30.518
Now, listen, there's been a shooting.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.592
- What's that?
- I say, there's been a shoo...

08:34.360 --> 08:36.476
Oh, for heaven's sake, where's your thing?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.551
There's been a shootin'!

08:39.600 --> 08:43.388
- Yeah?
- And there's three men laying dead out there.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.358
- Strange. I didn't hear nothin'.
- I'm not surprised.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.391
You never have your thing in.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.431
It's my afternoon off, Judge.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.552
I don't know what we pay you for, really I don't.

08:53.560 --> 08:57.439
- Who done it? Do you know?
- Some terrible-looking rough.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.516
He's over in Belle's place now.

08:59.560 --> 09:03.519
You've got to run him out of town.
I don't want that kind of person here.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.472
It lowers the tone of the whole neighbourhood.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.436
Well, don't you worry none, Judge.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.439
We'll have him out of here in an hour,
either head first or feet first.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.549
- Yeah.
- That's right.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.516
In my position, as Mayor...

09:15.560 --> 09:19.553
For heaven's sakes, where are your spectacles?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.512
- What do you say?
- Your spectacles!

09:22.560 --> 09:25.393
Er...around here someplace.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.351
Oh, here they are.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.436
- Where?
- Here they are!

09:30.600 --> 09:32.511
Ah! Here they are!

09:32.560 --> 09:35.393
Heh heh heh! Yeah!

09:36.520 --> 09:37.589
Yeah. That's better.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.475
Well, here we go.

09:41.520 --> 09:45.593
Oh! Here. There. That way. Ohhh.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.473
Wait a minute. Here.
For Pete's sake. Now, there.

09:52.520 --> 09:55.432
Yeah, well, thanks, Judge.

09:55.440 --> 09:58.557
These specs ain't so good
for seeing things a long ways off.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.509
He'll have to go.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.476
Yahoo!

10:16.600 --> 10:19.478
Forward ho!

10:21.600 --> 10:23.397
Whoa!

10:32.520 --> 10:34.431
Nice going, Lightning.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.552
All right, get away from that bar, stranger.
And don't try nothin'.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.556
It's me, Sheriff- Charlie.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.472
- Huh?
- Charlie!

11:01.520 --> 11:05.513
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Charlie.
Didn't recognise you from the front.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.354
- Where's the killer?
- Up with Belle, Sheriff. Room 12.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.549
- Room 12.
- Yup.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.556
Yeah. Well, thanks.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.391
You have a good sleep, sweetheart.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.358
(Lightning whinnies)
- See you later.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.478
I reckon you Texans think more of horses
than you do of us women.

11:40.520 --> 11:43.592
Naturally. If I was being chased by a posse,
I wouldn't get very far on you.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.512
If you were raising a family,
you wouldn't get far on a horse.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.437
EARP: <i>You in there!</i>
- (Knocking)

11:48.440 --> 11:52.433
You got five seconds to come out
with your hands up or I'm coming in to get you!

11:52.480 --> 11:53.549
Who's that?

11:53.560 --> 11:55.516
That's Albert. Albert Earp, our Sheriff.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.596
EARP: <i>Are you comin' out?</i>
- Nope.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.429
EARP: <i>Then I'm comin' in</i>.

11:59.480 --> 12:03.359
(Crashing and clattering)

12:04.400 --> 12:05.549
EARP: <i>Where's the door?</i>

12:10.440 --> 12:13.432
All right, get out of that bed,
get on your horse and get out of Stodge.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.436
That <i>is</i> his horse, Sheriff.

12:15.440 --> 12:16.555
These dang glasses.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.512
I'm better off without 'em. That's better.

12:19.520 --> 12:23.593
There's liable to be some fancy shooting around
here, Miss Belle. You'd better get the hell out.

12:23.600 --> 12:27.354
You'd better put them specs on.
I'm the fella you're looking for.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.470
- What was that?
- (Mouths)

12:29.480 --> 12:31.596
I'm the fella you're looking for!

12:32.360 --> 12:33.509
That's the game, is it?

12:33.560 --> 12:37.473
Well, it takes more than dressing up
in women's clothes to fool me, mister.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.516
On your way, cowboy... Cowboy?

12:39.560 --> 12:41.516
I've had enough of this.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.437
Look here, Twerp...

12:43.440 --> 12:46.432
Name's Earp. Albert Earp, without the "tw".

12:46.440 --> 12:49.352
With or without, what's the matter?
What have I done wrong?

12:49.400 --> 12:52.517
- You've killed three men, mister.
- I know that, but what have I done wrong?

12:53.520 --> 12:55.511
You wanna try drawin' on me, mister?

12:55.520 --> 12:58.353
I can't. I ain't got my guns.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.595
I'll give you five seconds to find one.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.431
One...

13:04.360 --> 13:05.554
..two...

13:05.600 --> 13:07.431
..three...

13:07.480 --> 13:09.471
- Where are they?
- ..five.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.476
(Gunshot)

13:15.440 --> 13:17.510
Sheriff! Sheriff!

13:17.560 --> 13:20.597
Here. Are...are you all right?

13:21.360 --> 13:23.430
I...reckon I'm going, Judge.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.436
Oh, don't go.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.550
Listen...listen, friend.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.512
Just tell my folks what happened, will you?

13:30.520 --> 13:32.511
They'll even the score.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.556
Will you do that for me, friend?

13:34.600 --> 13:36.511
Yes, of course.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.438
- What's that?
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.517
Here. Yes! Of course!

13:42.560 --> 13:45.597
There's...there's no need to shout, Judge.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.558
I'm...I'm wearing my specs.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.476
It's I lucky I remembered where you put that.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.590
Oh...I do beg your pardon, Commissioner.

14:12.600 --> 14:15.558
Damn it, Perkins, can't you see I'm busy!

14:15.600 --> 14:18.433
I'm terribly sorry, sir. This just wouldn't wait.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.351
Ahem. You think <i>this</i> will?

14:20.400 --> 14:23.517
All right, all right. What's so all-fired important?

14:23.560 --> 14:25.596
It's another telegraph from Stodge City, sir.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.430
Judge Burke - he's the Mayor there, you know.

14:28.480 --> 14:33.429
Burke? Oh, yeah, I remember him
in Law School. He's a bum.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.431
I didn't know you studied at Law School, sir?

14:35.480 --> 14:38.597
I didn't. I was the janitor.
What does the bum want?

14:38.600 --> 14:41.478
Lawless elements
have completely taken over the town.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.557
He wants us to send him a Peace Marshal
to clean the place up.

14:44.600 --> 14:48.559
Why bother me with all this?
Send him a Marshal. Anything for peace.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.558
Well, that's just the trouble, sir.
We haven't any available.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.437
Nobody?

14:53.480 --> 14:56.517
What about that bighead who hangs around,
looking for work?

14:56.560 --> 14:59.597
Er what's his name? Dillon.
What's he doing?

15:00.360 --> 15:01.429
Six months.

15:01.480 --> 15:05.393
Oh. Well, looks like we got a problem here.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.510
Miss Jones,
can you think of something we can do?

15:07.520 --> 15:09.431
Why, yes.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.352
But hadn't we better get the problem
out of the way first?

15:14.600 --> 15:16.397
Next.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.393
- What can I do for you?
- I'd like a job, please.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.356
- Name?
- Knutt.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.356
Er with a "K".

15:26.400 --> 15:28.356
Huh, you could have fooled me.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.469
First name?

15:29.520 --> 15:32.398
Marshall. Marshall P Knutt.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.431
Most of my friends call me "Marsh".

15:34.480 --> 15:37.517
Well, then, in that case,
you won't mind if I call you Marshall.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.351
Profession?

15:40.400 --> 15:44.473
Drainage, Sanitation
and Garbage Disposal Engineer, first class.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.391
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.509
Qualifications?

15:47.520 --> 15:52.469
Yes. I have a certificate from Chipping Sodbury
Technical College. That's in England.

15:52.520 --> 15:57.594
And a reference from Lady Pushing, saying
what a good job I did on her sludge channel,

15:57.600 --> 16:00.398
cos it was all...bunged up, you know.

16:00.440 --> 16:04.353
And this was presented to me
by the Chipping Sodbury Ladies' Guild,

16:04.400 --> 16:06.436
in appreciation for services rendered.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.555
It's a sink plunger.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.559
It's very interesting, Mr Knutt.
I fail to see how it can be of any use to us.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.513
That's where you're wrong. I don't mind telling
you that since I arrived in America,

16:17.560 --> 16:20.393
I've been amazed by your out-of-date methods.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.353
I mean, for instance your way of disposing
of garbage is a load of rubbish.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.515
And as for sanitation,

16:25.520 --> 16:28.592
I think you'll agree it's an absurd waste
of the President's time

16:29.360 --> 16:33.512
to have to walk from the White House all the way
to that little shed at the bottom of the garden.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.516
And as for your city streets...

16:35.560 --> 16:37.437
Mr Knutt!

16:37.440 --> 16:42.389
May I suggest that you see the Public Works
Department down the corridor?

16:42.440 --> 16:45.432
Oh. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.436
Just a minute. Mr Knutt!

16:49.440 --> 16:51.510
Would you please take this with you?

16:51.560 --> 16:53.596
Oh, yes. We mustn't forget that, must we?

16:58.560 --> 17:00.391
I'm terribly sorry.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.436
Yes?

17:42.520 --> 17:44.431
Well, what do you want?

17:44.440 --> 17:46.351
I was told you might give me a job.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.472
Job? What job? Who the blazes are you?

17:49.520 --> 17:51.556
Knutt. Marshall P Knutt.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.552
Marshal? No-one available, huh?

17:54.600 --> 17:57.558
Well, Marshal,
you couldn't have come at a better time.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.511
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.518
How would you like to go
and clean up Stodge City for me?

18:02.560 --> 18:04.551
Oh, very much, sir. In a bit of a mess, is it?

18:04.560 --> 18:06.516
You said it, Marshal. One heck of a mess.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.552
Funnily enough,
I was talking about that to the man outside.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.479
- Now, I have one or two theories.
- Yes, I'm sure you have, Marshal.

18:13.480 --> 18:17.519
But I'm a pretty busy man, so suppose you get
down to Stodge City and get to work, huh?

18:17.560 --> 18:19.551
See Judge Burke. He'll tell you what's doing.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.433
Judge Burke. Yes, and thank you very much.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.396
Not at all, Marshal, not at all.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.551
Stodge City.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.353
Oh, right in the country.
Should be nice and peaceful.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.391
(Shouting and gunfire)

18:44.560 --> 18:47.393
- Who was that? Who did it?
- (Gunfire)

18:48.400 --> 18:51.551
Isn't it sickening?
That's the tenth window broken in two weeks.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.431
Who was it, Judge?

18:54.480 --> 18:57.472
Some of those horrible friends
of the Rumpo Kid, of course.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.511
Look at my hat. Just look at it.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.552
Hey-hey! Three inches lower
and it would have been your head.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.471
Don't say that!

19:04.520 --> 19:07.398
Things have got pretty rough here
since he came.

19:07.440 --> 19:11.433
Rough?
It ain't safe for decent folks to walk the streets.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.398
Why, I have to send my wife out for everything.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.432
Never mind. Things will get better
when they send that Marshal.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.509
If they send him.

19:20.560 --> 19:25.395
Oh...ha ha! Why, hello, Sam.
What brings you into town?

19:25.440 --> 19:30.389
I tell you what brings me into town.
I lost 50 head of cattle on my ranch last night.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.516
Rustlers?
- They certainly weren't pickpockets!

19:32.560 --> 19:35.438
Well, there's no need to get all sarky.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.517
50 head.
What's more, my prize bull was among 'em.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.516
Not old Ramrod?

19:40.560 --> 19:45.350
Yeah. How am I to raise cattle without a bull?
Judge, you gotta do something.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.472
Well, it's hardly in my line of country, Sam.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.512
You know darned well that Rumpo Kid
and his gang are behind this.

19:51.560 --> 19:55.473
Yeah, you're probably right, Sam,
but how are you gonna prove it?

20:01.560 --> 20:03.516
And stay out of here...bum.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.551
# Lively fiddle and banjo

20:14.520 --> 20:16.431
Johnny.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.471
How about this for business, huh?

20:18.520 --> 20:20.590
Yeah,
you sure have made a difference to the place.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.393
Well, I like to see a bit of innocent fun.

20:27.440 --> 20:31.558
Johnny, just look at these beautiful furs.
Silver fox and he only wants $50 a skin.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.353
- Not bad.
- They'd make a lovely fur coat.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.435
I don't like wearing fur.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.391
No, Johnny, I meant for me.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.512
I get it. You want me to buy 'em for you, huh?

20:41.560 --> 20:43.437
Just 500 the lot, mister.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.512
Right. I just gotta get some money
from the bank. Won't be a minute.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.432
Morning, Mr Rumpo, sir. Anything for me today?

20:51.480 --> 20:54.392
Not yet, Josh. Stick around. It's early.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.555
(Gunshot)

21:04.560 --> 21:06.391
(A body thuds onto floor)

21:12.520 --> 21:14.476
Hey, that's the fourth in two weeks.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.516
(Laughs) You're in the wrong business.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.549
What's going on here?

21:23.400 --> 21:25.356
# The Can Can

22:08.400 --> 22:09.515
What is it, Judge?

22:09.560 --> 22:12.518
Don't look. Whatever you do, don't look.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.357
Why not?

22:14.400 --> 22:17.392
You'll never believe it,
but there are women dancing in there

22:17.400 --> 22:20.472
and showing their...underthings.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.476
- No.
- Right up to here.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.357
What do they look like?

22:25.400 --> 22:30.394
They're sort of black and frilly,
with these little pink rosebuds on 'em.

22:30.440 --> 22:34.433
What does it matter what they look like?
It's disgusting.

22:34.480 --> 22:38.439
Why, in 15 years of married life,
I haven't even seen my wife's.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.352
You don't need to worry.
They ain't got rosebuds on them.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.436
I'm glad to hear it. I... What?

22:43.480 --> 22:46.472
I'm kinda busy.
I've got some folk waiting in the surgery.

22:49.480 --> 22:53.473
Oh, he must have seen them on the clothesline.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.512
COWBOY: <i>Yahoo!</i>
- I'm gonna put a stop to this.

22:58.400 --> 22:59.549
Stop! Stop!

22:59.600 --> 23:03.388
- Stop! Stop!
- (Music stops)

23:03.400 --> 23:06.392
Stop this disgraceful exhibition immediately!

23:07.600 --> 23:12.469
Go on, get outta here!
And kindly adjust your dress before leaving.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.509
Hey.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.358
Just what do you think you're doing, Judge?

23:16.400 --> 23:19.597
Mr Kid, as Mayor of this town,
and guardian of law and order,

23:19.600 --> 23:23.479
I must object most strongly to this impropriety.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.549
Impro...what?

23:24.600 --> 23:27.478
All this jigging up and down
and lascivious dancing.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.357
What? It's educational.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.359
Educational? They never showed me
anything like that when I was at school.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.436
That's what I mean. It's never too late to learn.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.471
Sit down. Grab yourself a piece of culture.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.516
Culture? Just a minute.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.393
I suppose you think that's culture.

23:42.440 --> 23:46.513
Nope. That's my Aunt Fanny. She give me that
as a sort of house-warming present.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.397
Artistic, ain't it?

23:48.400 --> 23:50.391
But she ain't got no clothes on.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.556
Certainly not. She's in her working outfit.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.477
- What?
- She's an artist's model.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.590
I don't care if she's Lady Godiva.

23:56.600 --> 24:00.354
She's gotta come down.
I can't have that sort of thing around here.

24:00.400 --> 24:05.349
I'm determined to keep the Stodge out of sex.
The...the sex out of Stodge.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.516
Suppose you get out of here
while you're in one piece.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.516
I haven't finished yet.

24:09.520 --> 24:15.356
Oh, no. There's something else. You've got
to stop shooting all them cashiers at the bank.

24:15.400 --> 24:19.439
Wait. You can't blame me for that.
They won't let me draw no money.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.516
Before you draw money out of a bank,

24:21.520 --> 24:25.354
- you're supposed to put some in.
- That's a funny way to rob a bank.

24:25.400 --> 24:30.520
And don't think I don't know who's behind all the
cattle-rustling that's been going on around here.

24:30.560 --> 24:35.350
What cattle-rustling? You won't find
no cows here. Not the kind you're looking for.

24:35.400 --> 24:39.359
Don't think you're gonna get away with it,
Rumpo. I'm gonna get you. Do you hear me?

24:39.400 --> 24:40.549
I'm gonna get you.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.477
Now's as good a time as any, Judge.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.392
Don't get me wrong. I-I-I was only joking.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.431
Make me laugh some more. Go for your gun.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.471
(Kid chuckles)

24:55.520 --> 24:58.512
Judge! Judge!

24:58.520 --> 25:02.433
Judge...this telegraph just come for you.

25:02.480 --> 25:05.392
A-ha! It's from Washington.

25:05.400 --> 25:09.518
They're sending down a United States Marshal.

25:09.560 --> 25:14.429
- A what?
- Yeah. Kinda changes things, doesn't it?

25:14.440 --> 25:18.399
He'll arrive on the first stage from Denver. Huh!

25:18.440 --> 25:19.509
BOTH: Yeah!

25:32.480 --> 25:35.392
Excuse me. Do you go all the way?

25:35.400 --> 25:38.392
- I-I beg your pardon?
- All the way...to Stodge City?

25:38.440 --> 25:40.556
Oh, yeah. I have a job of work to do there.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.592
Really? Oh, that's marvellous. So do I.

25:43.600 --> 25:47.513
I'm a Drainage, Sanitation
and Garbage Disposal Engineer, first class.

25:47.560 --> 25:50.358
I just knew you'd be something exciting like that.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.356
I've been sent to clean up the town.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.470
I had something in mind for myself like that.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.436
- What are you going for?
- Vengeance.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.555
Oh... What?

25:57.600 --> 26:00.592
My father was Sheriff in Stodge City
and somebody shot him.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.554
I'm going there to find out who.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.431
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.517
But I don't think a nice girl like you
should be doing things like that.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.432
I mean, even if you do find out who it was,
what can you do?

26:10.480 --> 26:11.515
Kill him?

26:15.480 --> 26:16.515
It's no use, Johnny.

26:16.560 --> 26:20.439
If a Marshal's coming to Stodge,
we may just as well pack up and move on.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.549
If he gets this far.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.471
Well, how are you gonna stop him?

26:24.520 --> 26:28.433
You take a shot at a Peace Marshal
and they'll send the US Cavalry to get you.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.471
Belle's right, Kid. You can't touch a Marshal.

26:30.520 --> 26:34.399
I know. But just supposing
that stage was to get raided by Indians?

26:34.400 --> 26:35.469
Are you kidding?

26:35.520 --> 26:39.433
There's only one lot of Indians left around here
and they couldn't raid a larder.

26:39.440 --> 26:43.399
Maybe we could give 'em a hand.
Come on, Charlie, let's go and talk to 'em.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.357
Stop!

26:53.400 --> 26:55.470
How! We come in peace.

27:06.480 --> 27:10.439
Look, here, Mr...Injun.
We ain't come here to buy a load of junk.

27:10.440 --> 27:13.557
We wanna talk with the big chief. Savvy?

27:13.600 --> 27:15.591
You wait.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.353
Big chief in little lodge.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.515
(Toilet flushes)

27:27.560 --> 27:29.391
Oh, hello!

27:30.560 --> 27:32.471
(Speaks tribal language)

27:38.360 --> 27:39.429
Halt.

27:39.480 --> 27:45.510
Me-um big pale-faced chief
from-um Stodge City.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.552
Me-um salute-um big chief.

27:48.560 --> 27:52.394
Me-um want-um powwow.

27:52.440 --> 27:55.477
I say, you do talk funny.
You must be foreigners.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.550
Why didn't you tell me he could talk English?

27:57.600 --> 28:00.433
I'm sorry, Kid. I didn't know.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.556
Chief, this is Johnny Finger,
known as the Rumpo Kid.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.551
Oh, how do you do?

28:04.600 --> 28:07.398
And a very charming name.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.590
I'm called Man Ooh-ahh!

28:10.360 --> 28:12.476
Roughly translated, it means "Big Heap".

28:12.520 --> 28:13.555
Very picturesque.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.556
And this is my son Little Heap.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.478
Or as we say, Mini Man Ooh-ahh.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.516
(Speaks tribal language)

28:20.520 --> 28:22.590
No, you can't have their scalps.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.551
The very idea. He's scalp mad.

28:25.600 --> 28:29.434
Glad to hear that, Chief.
Maybe we can help him get one.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.431
Oh, no, don't encourage him.

28:31.480 --> 28:33.516
We can sit down and talk it over, can't we?

28:33.560 --> 28:35.551
But, of course. Where are my manners?

28:38.440 --> 28:42.558
I think you'll find this piece of ground
most comfortable. No sharp stones.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.552
Son, tell my squaw to fetch the peace pipe.

28:49.560 --> 28:50.515
Ugh!

28:50.560 --> 28:52.516
You'd care for a piece of pipe?

28:52.520 --> 28:56.433
Be glad to, Chief. I once talked peace
with the Sioux, but you can't trust 'em.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.392
One minute, it was peace on,
the next...peace off.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.516
You won't have any trouble with us,
I can assure you.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.518
Personally, I hate fighting.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.516
(Growls)

29:14.520 --> 29:16.431
Ohhh.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.596
This is my new squaw, Kitikata.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.478
I bought her for two buffalo skins.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.478
- How.
- Never mind how. Where?

29:25.520 --> 29:27.511
(Pipe gurgles)

29:27.560 --> 29:29.551
(Coughs)

29:31.560 --> 29:34.518
What have you got in there - old moccasins?

29:34.560 --> 29:38.439
- Thank you, no. I'm trying to give it up.
- I don't blame you.

29:39.480 --> 29:42.392
You don't happen to have any fire water,
do you?

29:42.440 --> 29:44.431
You like whisky?

29:45.400 --> 29:48.392
Oh. My favourite brand.

29:48.440 --> 29:51.432
Ah-ah. If I give you this,
I gotta have something in return.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.471
She's yours.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.357
Oh, no, not that.

29:56.440 --> 29:59.398
Well...maybe...maybe that on account.

29:59.440 --> 30:01.556
- What else do you want?
- A certain fella got rid of.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.596
Where is he? On the stage.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.556
Oh! I don't blame you.

30:05.600 --> 30:08.433
I can't stand actors myself. Peculiar lot.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.590
The stage <i>coach</i> coming in from Denver today.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.478
All you gotta do is raid it and get him.

30:13.520 --> 30:18.389
Oh, I don't like the sound of that. I'm told they
carry guns on these stages. It might get rough.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.470
Your favourite brand. Try some.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.476
Plenty more where that come from.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.355
Well...

30:30.560 --> 30:32.437
Cor.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.550
Down with Custer.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.438
Slaughter the Pale Faces.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.391
Massacre the lot.

31:00.600 --> 31:04.513
Ah. That's the signal from Little Heap.
They've sighted the stage.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.391
Where?

31:06.400 --> 31:10.393
Well, there. Don't you see the smoke signals?
Now, I must acknowledge them.

31:11.440 --> 31:16.389
I'll be glad when this is over.
I feel a right Charlie in this get-up, I can tell you.

31:16.440 --> 31:20.399
You look great: a sort of a cross
between Hiawatha and Rose Marie.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.551
Eurgh. I still don't see
why we have to dress up like this?

31:23.560 --> 31:25.516
Because we have to look like Injuns.

31:25.560 --> 31:29.599
I don't trust that Big Heap out of my sight.
Now, quit beefing and give me that dynamite.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.351
Come on, fella.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.552
Here. If you can't stop that stage
any other way, use these.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.511
Oh, thank you.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.511
What are you messing about at?

31:42.560 --> 31:45.438
I'm just trying to start a fire to answer Little Heap.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.556
- Try a match.
- Oh, dear me, no.

31:47.560 --> 31:52.429
Why, my people have been getting fire
this way for thousands of years. It's such fun.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.357
What's that got to do with it?

31:54.400 --> 31:56.516
They got kids the same way
for thousands of years, too.

31:56.520 --> 31:57.509
Well?

31:57.560 --> 31:59.437
Carry on with the sticks.

32:02.480 --> 32:06.393
- All right, get on your horses.
- (Explosion)

32:13.560 --> 32:15.471
(Laughs)

32:15.520 --> 32:17.590
I say. It's never worked as well as that before.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.555
Oh, we've stopped.

32:24.560 --> 32:28.394
So we have. And I should think so, too.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.551
12 hours is a long time
in a coach with no corridor.

32:37.560 --> 32:39.437
Well, where is it?

32:39.440 --> 32:42.398
We ain't stopped for that, mister.
Lookee up over there.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.555
<i>Injuns.</i>

32:43.560 --> 32:45.437
- What?
- Injuns?

32:45.480 --> 32:46.549
You mean railway engines?

32:46.600 --> 32:49.512
Red Injuns. Them's smoke signals.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.556
- What do they mean?
- Danged if I know.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.431
Ooh, I can tell you.

32:53.480 --> 32:56.392
I bought a useful phrase book in Washington.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.356
Smoke signals...

32:58.400 --> 33:00.516
Ah, here it is. Now, what are they saying?

33:00.520 --> 33:03.512
<i>Puff</i>...<i>puff, puff-puff</i>...

33:03.560 --> 33:05.596
..<i>puff</i>...<i>puff</i>...<i>puff</i>...<i>puff</i>...

33:06.360 --> 33:10.399
puff-puff...p-puff.

33:11.400 --> 33:15.359
Here it is. "Please Direct me
to the ladies' or gentlemen's cloakroom."

33:15.400 --> 33:17.436
Oh, that can't be right, can it?

33:17.480 --> 33:20.597
Well, if it is, Indians can't be very particular.

33:20.600 --> 33:24.388
Yeah, well, I ain't hanging around here,
listening to you puffing.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.472
Cos all I know is,
where there's Injuns, there's trouble.

33:27.520 --> 33:31.433
Trouble? Oh, don't be silly. There hasn't been
any trouble with Indians for years.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.357
They're perfectly friendly now.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.549
Call that friendly?

33:36.520 --> 33:39.557
Oh, they're only playing. They wouldn't hurt us.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.515
Some game.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.437
(Indians whooping)

33:55.560 --> 33:58.393
Now, what are we gonna do, mister?
Play with 'em?

34:00.560 --> 34:02.471
Now, don't panic. It's all right.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.516
I know what to do. Form a circle.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.391
Yes, that's it! Form a circle.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.589
With one coach?

34:07.600 --> 34:11.478
- Oh, yes, that would be difficult.
- If you two don't mind, I'll get back in.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.516
- That's a good idea.
- Oh, no, you don't, mister.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.596
We're gonna need every man that we've got.

34:15.600 --> 34:19.388
Now, you get a hold of that,
get up there and start shootin'!

34:19.440 --> 34:21.431
(Gunfire)

34:29.440 --> 34:31.476
I don't know
what we would have done without him.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.510
I'd better get to work, I suppose.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.551
(Indians whooping a war cry)

35:02.480 --> 35:03.549
I got one!

35:15.400 --> 35:17.391
Two that time, with only one bullet!

35:17.440 --> 35:19.556
Look, they've shot three of my braves.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.437
What do you want them to do?

35:21.480 --> 35:24.552
Use bullets with those little rubber suction cups
stuck on the end?

35:24.560 --> 35:26.516
Here, have a drop more courage.

35:38.360 --> 35:39.475
That does it!

35:39.520 --> 35:41.590
<i>Little Heap!</i>

35:42.360 --> 35:45.352
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling off the attack.

35:45.400 --> 35:49.439
Oompah! Stickity! Jumper! Bloody quick!

35:52.480 --> 35:53.549
They're going!

36:00.640 --> 36:03.598
Hey, come back.
You gonna let one little fella chase you away?

36:05.480 --> 36:08.552
You call yourself braves?
I've seen braver cowards.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.552
Wh-wh-wh-what happened?

36:17.560 --> 36:19.391
Eugh.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.396
They've run away. They've had enough.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.472
Well, yeah, you get down off there
and we get out of here before they come back.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.351
What hit me?

36:29.400 --> 36:31.516
Oh, no. I don't believe it.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.515
What happened to him?

36:34.560 --> 36:37.393
- Oh, it was just the excitement, I guess.
- Oh.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.516
- Get him in the coach.
- Hold this a minute.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.517
Come on! Let's get out of here.
Come on! Come on, giddup! Giddup!

36:45.560 --> 36:46.595
Giddup!

36:47.480 --> 36:50.392
- Do you drive?
- Who? Me? Er, yes, I suppose so.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.555
Well, I should start, if I were you.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.512
- There's still a couple of Indians over there.
- Oh, right.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.469
Yah! Yah!

37:13.440 --> 37:15.351
Come on. Whoa.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.556
We got to finish this ourselves, Charlie.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.437
- Is he mad?
- Looks like it. I'm getting out of here. Giddup.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.549
KID: <i>Ow!</i>

37:29.600 --> 37:33.354
Charlie! Charlie! Help!

37:33.400 --> 37:36.437
Ooh! Where you been?

37:37.400 --> 37:40.392
- You want help getting on your horse, Kid?
- Are you joking?

37:40.600 --> 37:42.556
- Ooh!
- (Laughs)

37:42.560 --> 37:44.391
Ah, shut up!

37:44.440 --> 37:45.555
(Laughs)

37:45.640 --> 37:47.471
Ooh!

37:50.440 --> 37:51.475
Shut up!

38:06.360 --> 38:08.555
- Is he gonna be all right, Doc?
- Yeah, reckon so.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.431
Pity.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.391
He's coming round.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.555
Something wrong with your drains.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.478
He's delirious. Ah, poor feller.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.432
- Indians! Indians!
- Where?

38:22.400 --> 38:25.392
Listen, don't worry.
You're gonna be quite safe now.

38:25.440 --> 38:28.432
He's gonna be all right.
He's just a bit shook up, that's all.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.515
Pity.

38:29.520 --> 38:32.557
Don't keep saying that. It gets on my nerves.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.477
What exactly happened, Bert?

38:34.520 --> 38:36.556
Well, I don't rightly know, for sure.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.636
But from what Miss Oakley here says,

38:39.360 --> 38:43.353
this young fella shot three Injuns
and drove the rest of 'em away.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.516
Amazing. Is that right, miss?

38:45.560 --> 38:47.471
Well, there was only him.

38:47.480 --> 38:50.517
You couldn't expect a defenceless
little thing like me to do anything?

38:50.560 --> 38:52.551
I suppose not.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.556
It seems incredible.

38:54.600 --> 38:58.513
Well, I think he was just wonderful.
I don't know what I'd have done without him.

38:58.520 --> 38:59.589
Oh, it was nothing.

38:59.640 --> 39:04.395
If you'll excuse me, I'd like to get settled in.
There is a hotel here, isn't there?

39:04.440 --> 39:09.389
Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it, Miss Oakley.
They get a funny lot in there.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.470
I think I can take care of myself, thank you.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.516
- I'll take you over, Miss.
- Ah, thank you.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.551
Gosh, this sure is heavy.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.591
Just a few feminine, little knick-knacks.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.589
Yeah.

39:19.360 --> 39:20.429
Oh, she's lovely.

39:20.480 --> 39:24.553
You won't have time for that sort of thing.
You've got work to do.

39:24.600 --> 39:27.592
Don't worry, sir.
I'm very keen to get started right away.

39:27.600 --> 39:31.559
That's the spirit.
I'll show you your office, Marshal.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.478
Marshall? How did you know my name?

39:34.480 --> 39:39.395
Washington told me you were coming.
I am Judge Burke, the Mayor.

39:39.440 --> 39:42.477
That's right.
The Judge's folk founded Stodge City, Marshal.

39:42.480 --> 39:47.554
My great grandfather came over here
on the Mayflower. He was the original Burke.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.479
He married into the Wright family
and became a Wright-Burke.

39:51.480 --> 39:53.471
The whole family are Wright-Burkes, Marshal.

39:56.440 --> 39:57.509
Charming.

39:58.600 --> 40:02.388
"Rumpo's Place".
It sounds pretty exclusive.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.437
Yeah. The Rumpo Kid, that is, miss.
He runs this town.

40:05.480 --> 40:08.552
- Don't you have a Sheriff?
- We did have, but he sort of died.

40:08.600 --> 40:11.433
- Oh, really? How?
- Lead poisoning.

40:11.480 --> 40:12.595
Who shot the lead into him?

40:12.600 --> 40:17.390
I can't say, miss. And if I was you, I wouldn't ask
questions like that around these parts.

40:17.440 --> 40:20.432
Right, in here. Charlie will fix you up with a room.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.551
Here we are, Marshal.

40:25.600 --> 40:29.479
Thank you, Judge, but I wish
you'd call me Marsh like my friends do.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.596
- Marsh?
- Yes, it's short for Marshall.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.592
- Oh, I couldn't do a thing like that.
- You couldn't?

40:34.640 --> 40:38.428
No. It'd be like me calling the Sheriff "Sheree".

40:38.440 --> 40:42.353
People around here
would have thought that mighty peculiar.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.358
Well, this is it. How do you like it?

40:47.400 --> 40:48.515
Oh, it's very cosy.

40:48.560 --> 40:54.430
And there's a nice bedroom for you through
there, and plenty of guns for you to use.

40:54.440 --> 40:56.396
Oh, thank you very much.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.391
But what do I want guns for?

40:58.440 --> 41:00.476
Don't tell me you've got rats around here.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.351
Have we got rats?

41:02.400 --> 41:06.359
Ever since the Rumpo Kid came to town,
the place has been full of them.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.595
That's not so good.
They didn't tell me that was your problem.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.558
Well, never mind. I'm sure you'll get rid of them.

41:11.600 --> 41:15.479
Oh, yes. Mind you, I won't be going round
shooting these rats, Judge.

41:15.520 --> 41:18.478
The thing to do is to find out
where they do their breeding.

41:18.520 --> 41:20.476
- Really?
- So as you don't get any more.

41:20.480 --> 41:23.552
Well, that sounds like a long-term policy to me.

41:23.600 --> 41:27.388
Still, I'm sure you must know what you're doing.

41:27.400 --> 41:30.551
Oh, yes. In my experience,
they usually do it down in the drains.

41:30.600 --> 41:33.478
You must have had
some very funny experiences.

41:33.520 --> 41:36.512
I have. Well, you can't be
a drainage engineer without, you know.

41:36.560 --> 41:40.439
- A what?
- A drainage engineer. That's my job.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.431
But you're a Marshal.

41:42.480 --> 41:43.549
No, Marshall's my name.

41:43.600 --> 41:49.391
Marshall P Knutt. Drainage, sanitation
and garbage disposal engineer, first class.

41:49.440 --> 41:53.399
They sent me down here to clean the place up.
Didn't they tell you?

41:53.400 --> 41:56.472
But we want a Peace Marshal,
not a Drainee Marshal.

41:56.520 --> 41:58.397
Drain <i>age,</i> -age, -age.

41:58.440 --> 42:03.434
Oh! Don't you understand?
This town is full of gunmen and outlaws.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.436
That's what we want cleaned up.

42:05.480 --> 42:07.516
You mean, there isn't a job for me?

42:07.600 --> 42:10.433
Of course there isn't a job for...

42:10.440 --> 42:12.510
Wait a minute.

42:12.520 --> 42:16.433
No-one around here knows
you're not a real Marshal, do they?

42:16.480 --> 42:18.516
Oh, Annie Oakley. I told her my job.

42:18.560 --> 42:23.429
Oh, she don't matter.
And you did shoot them Indians single-handed?

42:23.480 --> 42:24.515
Granted, yes.

42:24.520 --> 42:28.399
Come to think of it,
you'll make a marvellous Marshal.

42:28.440 --> 42:32.399
- Who, me?
- Yes. You'll clean up Stodge City.

42:32.440 --> 42:36.513
Oh, you'll become the most admired,
the most feared man in the West.

42:36.560 --> 42:38.596
Oh, they'll write books about you.

42:39.360 --> 42:43.558
<i>I can see it: "The Legend of Marshal P Knutt".</i>

42:43.640 --> 42:46.518
"The Legend of Marshall P Knutt."

42:48.480 --> 42:51.472
All right, Curly, round up the boys.
We've got a job on tonight.

42:51.480 --> 42:52.469
Sure thing, Kid.

42:52.520 --> 42:55.432
- Give me a drink, Charlie.
- You ought to know, Mr Rumpo,

42:55.480 --> 42:59.393
that woman that's staying here's
asking a lot about Sheriff Earp's death.

42:59.400 --> 43:00.515
What woman who's staying here?

43:00.560 --> 43:02.551
She came in on the stage. I let her have a room.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.556
- Where is she?
- Upstairs. Room 11.

43:04.600 --> 43:08.513
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't like women who ask awkward questions.

43:08.520 --> 43:11.398
She's going out of here on her big, fat bustle.

43:15.640 --> 43:17.437
(Knock on door)
- Come in!

43:17.440 --> 43:19.510
All right, lady, just pack your bags and...

43:22.560 --> 43:24.437
I thought you were the maid.

43:25.560 --> 43:27.471
I am.

43:27.520 --> 43:30.353
You don't look too much
like a chambermaid to me.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.435
It's my day off.

43:31.480 --> 43:33.516
You must be the one they call
the Rumpo Kid, huh?

43:33.560 --> 43:35.391
Yep. That's me.

43:35.440 --> 43:37.431
And you want me to pack my bags and leave?

43:37.440 --> 43:39.476
Leave? Where did you get that idea?

43:39.520 --> 43:42.557
Well, I thought...
What did you come in here for, then?

43:42.600 --> 43:44.591
Just to say welcome.

43:45.360 --> 43:48.511
I hope you have a long and friendly stay here.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.551
Well, thank you. Thank you.

43:50.600 --> 43:53.558
You just ask for anything you want.
It's all on the house.

43:53.560 --> 43:56.393
Thank you.
Right now I'd like to get out of my bath.

43:56.400 --> 43:58.356
Oh. Give you a hand?

43:58.400 --> 44:00.391
No, no, but you can pass a towel if you like.

44:01.400 --> 44:02.549
Yep.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.516
Here you are.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.396
All right, I won't look.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.431
- No?
- Nope.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.436
Oh, well. Worth a try.

44:16.560 --> 44:22.510
Yeah, well...it was er...nice er...seeing you.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.551
And you, too. You've been very sweet to me.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.477
Well, did you do it?

44:29.520 --> 44:32.398
- Did I do what?
- Did you tell her to go?

44:32.400 --> 44:35.517
Oh, that. Yeah, sure. I gave it to her straight,
cards on the table, man to man.

44:35.560 --> 44:37.391
Man to man, huh?

44:37.400 --> 44:38.515
Yup. Right between the eyes.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.357
So she's going?

44:40.400 --> 44:44.359
Nope. The fact is, Belle, she's straight.
I reckon she's not trying to hide nothing.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.549
She couldn't. Not in that bath.

44:45.600 --> 44:48.558
You're right there. Boy, has she got...

44:48.560 --> 44:50.516
Oh. You saw.

44:50.560 --> 44:55.395
Yeah, well, I happened to be standing here
and the keyhole came up against my eye.

44:55.440 --> 44:58.477
(Laughs nervously)
Well...then y-y-you saw for yourself.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.357
I mean, she's nice...a nice girl.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.516
You can't go throwing
a poor little thing like that out.

45:03.520 --> 45:07.479
- You know how it is.
- Yeah, yeah. I know just how it is.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.471
Reckon she does know how it is, too.

45:14.480 --> 45:16.436
(Chortles)

45:17.480 --> 45:20.552
The Rumpo Kid.
He's the one we gotta get something on.

45:20.600 --> 45:24.354
He's behind everything
that's going on around here.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.391
Why didn't you just run him out of town, then?

45:26.400 --> 45:28.516
Everybody's scared stiff of him.

45:28.520 --> 45:30.511
Except me, of course.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.471
Pardon me.

45:35.440 --> 45:36.509
Mind if I come in?

45:36.560 --> 45:41.429
Why, of course, Mr Rumpo.
We're always delighted to see you.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.431
I wanted to meet the new Marshal.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.391
Oh, thank you.

45:45.400 --> 45:49.473
I thought I'd tip you off. There's going to be
another raid on Colonel Houston's cattle tonight.

45:49.520 --> 45:51.431
What? How do you know?

45:51.440 --> 45:54.352
A stranger came into my place
and told one of the girls.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.436
- You don't say.
- Yup.

45:56.440 --> 45:59.591
The girl's not involved, mind you.
She's a nice, pure, innocent kid.

45:59.600 --> 46:02.478
He just happened to talk in his sleep.

46:02.520 --> 46:04.476
Well, thank you for telling me, Mr Rumpo.

46:04.480 --> 46:08.393
A pleasure, Marshal. Any time I can do
anything to help, don't be afraid to ask.

46:08.440 --> 46:12.513
Gentlemen, if you'll pardon me, I've promised
to talk to the Ladies' Sewing Circle.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.516
He doesn't seem such a bad fellow.

46:14.520 --> 46:19.355
Don't you believe it.
There's something funny going on around here.

46:19.400 --> 46:24.599
Why, I'm almost positive he and his gang
are doing all the cattle-rustling around here.

46:24.600 --> 46:28.354
Impossible. He wouldn't have come in
and told us if it was him.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.391
No. No, that's a point.

46:30.400 --> 46:32.436
We've gotta do some quick thinking.

46:32.480 --> 46:35.438
"Tonight", he said. That's today.

46:35.480 --> 46:39.473
That's pretty quick thinking.
Don't overdo it. Leave it to me.

46:39.520 --> 46:42.432
Now, let me see... Now...

46:42.440 --> 46:48.356
The best plan would be for you to ride out there
after dark...and surprise 'em.

46:48.400 --> 46:51.437
- All by myself?
- No, no, no. You gotta take a posse with you.

46:51.480 --> 46:55.393
- Why? Don't they like cats?
- A posse! Not a pussy!

46:55.400 --> 46:59.518
You can't go out there and handle
a whole gang of rustlers and killers by yourself.

46:59.560 --> 47:01.516
- Can't I?
- No, no.

47:01.560 --> 47:06.429
You've got to find some brave
and public-spirited citizens to help you.

47:06.440 --> 47:09.398
Oh, yes, I see. Like you, you mean.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.435
Exactly.

47:10.480 --> 47:13.597
Except that, unfortunately,
tonight I have another engagement.

47:14.360 --> 47:15.475
Any other night, of course.

47:15.520 --> 47:19.513
But don't worry. You're bound to find somebody.

47:19.520 --> 47:21.431
Yeah!

47:29.480 --> 47:31.357
Yup.

47:41.560 --> 47:42.549
Howdy, Marshal.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.477
What can I do for you?

47:46.520 --> 47:48.556
Well, actually, I'm trying to get up a posse.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.431
Oh? For tonight, you mean?

47:50.440 --> 47:53.432
That's right. I thought you
and a few of your men could er...

47:53.480 --> 47:56.472
Oh, it's a pity, Marshal. I'm sorry.
We can't help you tonight.

47:56.480 --> 48:00.519
We got a little choir practice.
I promised the boys. Right, boys?

48:02.520 --> 48:07.435
Oh. It's funny, but everyone I've asked
so far seems to be doing something else.

48:07.480 --> 48:10.392
Ah, gee, that's tough, Marshal. Ain't it?

48:11.440 --> 48:15.399
Wait a minute. I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you two of my boys. Short.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.436
- Yeah, boss.
- I got a little job for you.

48:18.480 --> 48:21.472
Take these two, Marshal - Short and Curly.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.469
How do you do?

48:43.440 --> 48:44.555
Who was that?

48:44.600 --> 48:47.398
Just Rumpo and some of the boys, Marshal.

48:47.400 --> 48:49.516
Oh! Off to their choir practice.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.358
I'm sorry if I'm making you miss yours.

48:52.400 --> 48:55.437
That's all right, Marshal.
We'll get up extra early and do some.

48:55.480 --> 48:58.472
Oh, good.
By the way, I've got your Deputy badges.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.357
No, thank you, Marshal.

49:00.400 --> 49:03.551
It ain't wise to wear them.
Makes too easy a target.

49:03.600 --> 49:06.512
Oh...yes.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.476
Well, I suppose we'd better be off, then.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.516
Yup. Got a horse all ready for you, Marshal.

49:12.560 --> 49:16.348
Oh...yes. Yes, that's a horse, all right.

49:31.560 --> 49:36.350
Looks like you forgot to fasten your girth,
Marshal. (Laughs)

49:39.400 --> 49:41.436
Hey, come back! Horse!

49:41.440 --> 49:43.396
Horse!

49:49.440 --> 49:51.431
(Cattle low)

49:56.480 --> 49:58.391
The herd seems mighty restless.

49:58.440 --> 49:59.589
You hear anything, Joe?

50:08.400 --> 50:11.517
Nice work. When you're through,
take a handful of steers up to Bear Pass.

50:11.560 --> 50:14.358
I'm going to see Sam Houston. Come on!

50:17.440 --> 50:19.351
(Laughter)

50:25.480 --> 50:28.392
- Howdy, mister.
- Howdy, Colonel.

50:28.440 --> 50:31.398
I was just up in the high ground
getting the stock in.

50:31.400 --> 50:34.517
I've just seen some fellas making off
with a whole heap of your cattle.

50:34.560 --> 50:36.437
The hell you say.

50:36.480 --> 50:40.519
- Jake! Get them ready to ride!
- Sure thing, Colonel.

50:40.520 --> 50:42.511
I'm mighty grateful to you, mister.

50:42.560 --> 50:44.437
Whereabouts you saw 'em?

50:44.480 --> 50:46.391
They were just coming over Bear Pass.

50:46.440 --> 50:47.429
What you say?

50:47.440 --> 50:49.351
Bear...Pass.

50:49.400 --> 50:52.358
Oh. My hearing isn't so good these days.

51:01.560 --> 51:03.551
That's the cattle, all right.

51:03.600 --> 51:05.477
They've got the Bar X brand on 'em.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.396
Well, where are all the rustlers, then?

51:09.400 --> 51:14.349
Well, I reckon just the sight of you, Marshal,
must have scared them away.

51:15.360 --> 51:17.430
Oh, yes, I suppose so.

51:17.480 --> 51:19.436
Well, what are we gonna do now, then?

51:19.480 --> 51:23.553
Well, I reckon the best thing we can do
is to leave you to look after them steers

51:23.560 --> 51:25.437
while we ride and get us some help.

51:25.480 --> 51:27.357
Just what I was going to suggest.

51:39.400 --> 51:41.391
- There they are, Colonel.
- Yeah!

51:41.440 --> 51:43.556
Come on! Let's get 'em! Hah!

51:46.560 --> 51:48.437
(Gunshots)

51:57.480 --> 51:59.357
Colonel Houston?

51:59.400 --> 52:00.549
Yeah. That's me.

52:00.560 --> 52:02.471
Oh.

52:04.400 --> 52:05.594
Do you mind if I do this, Colonel?

52:06.360 --> 52:11.480
As an upright and law-abiding citizen of
Stodge City and a lifelong friend of Sheriff Earp,

52:11.520 --> 52:13.431
I consider it my duty.

52:13.440 --> 52:15.396
Your privilege, sir.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.431
What do you think you're doing?

52:17.440 --> 52:19.476
You're making a terrible mistake, you know.

52:19.520 --> 52:22.557
- I can sue you for this. I've got my rights.
- Pipe down, will you?

52:22.600 --> 52:24.511
What are you getting so excited about?

52:24.520 --> 52:27.478
I can't help it.
I've always been nervous and highly strung.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.556
You're about to be strung even higher, pal.

52:38.600 --> 52:41.398
Right, we'll just take the other end and make it...

52:41.440 --> 52:42.555
- Ugh!
- ..good and tight.

52:55.560 --> 52:57.437
Yahoo!

53:00.400 --> 53:01.515
Yahoo!

53:04.560 --> 53:06.437
Ruffians!

53:10.400 --> 53:12.391
Marshal! Marshal!

53:12.440 --> 53:14.431
It's me - Judge Burke.

53:14.480 --> 53:16.391
(Knock on door)

53:17.520 --> 53:20.557
What are you doing in there?
You can't stay locked up all the time.

53:20.560 --> 53:23.393
You're supposed to be keeping law and order.

53:23.400 --> 53:24.469
Oh, no.

53:25.480 --> 53:28.392
He's out to get me. I know it. That Rumpo.

53:28.440 --> 53:31.591
Don't be silly. They wouldn't dare
do anything to a US Marshal.

53:31.600 --> 53:34.353
"Wouldn't dare do anything", he says.

53:34.400 --> 53:37.517
Judge, I was nearly hanged the other night,
like a common criminal.

53:37.520 --> 53:39.556
Oh, you don't wanna worry about that.

53:39.600 --> 53:42.433
Some of my best friends have been hanged.

53:42.480 --> 53:44.550
There ain't no stigma attached to it out West.

53:44.560 --> 53:48.394
Well, they can't fool me. It was Rumpo's doing.
He arranged the whole thing.

53:48.440 --> 53:51.432
Oh, come on, now. You're imagining things.

53:51.480 --> 53:55.473
Both he and old Sam apologised very nicely
the next day.

53:55.520 --> 53:59.399
It was a natural mistake
to make in the circumstances.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.431
Do I look like a cattle rustler?

54:01.480 --> 54:05.553
No, but you don't look
like a sanitary inspector either.

54:05.600 --> 54:09.559
I am not a sanitary inspector!
I am a sanitation engineer, first class!

54:09.600 --> 54:12.558
Shh. Do you want everybody to hear?

54:12.560 --> 54:15.597
Look, first of all the Indian attack
on the stage coach.

54:15.600 --> 54:17.556
Then this cattle rustling business.

54:17.600 --> 54:21.388
That didn't happen by accident.
That was planned to get me out of the way.

54:21.400 --> 54:24.358
And it would have worked
if that fella hadn't come to my rescue.

54:24.400 --> 54:25.515
Yeah, who was he?

54:25.520 --> 54:28.592
I don't know.
He just untied my hands and he galloped off.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.556
- But I'd know him again, all right.
- How?

54:30.600 --> 54:33.478
He had a very strong smell of perfume.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.431
Really?

54:35.480 --> 54:37.471
We're getting a funny lot round here.

54:37.520 --> 54:39.431
(Knock on door)
- Who is it?

54:39.440 --> 54:40.589
<i>Sam Houston</i>.

54:45.400 --> 54:46.515
What is it? What's the matter?

54:46.560 --> 54:50.439
They were at my place again last night.
Yes! Got away with 40 head.

54:50.480 --> 54:51.595
Who were they? Did you see 'em?

54:51.600 --> 54:54.353
It was too dark to see much.

54:54.400 --> 54:56.436
Yeah,
but I recognised it was one of Rumpo's men.

54:56.480 --> 54:58.596
Marshal, you've gotta do something.

54:59.360 --> 55:01.555
Well, I don't see what I can do without any proof.

55:01.600 --> 55:04.478
Here's proof for you. Take a look at that.

55:05.520 --> 55:08.478
You match up those hoof prints
and you've got your man.

55:08.520 --> 55:10.556
But how did they get up there?

55:10.600 --> 55:12.591
What have you been doing?

55:12.600 --> 55:15.353
Well, I was out courting.

55:15.400 --> 55:17.436
There's no law against it.

55:17.440 --> 55:21.353
No, no, of course not, but I can think of
more comfortable places to do it.

55:21.400 --> 55:25.552
Marshal, I think it's time
you and Rumpo had a little talk.

55:25.600 --> 55:29.434
Well, if you think there's evidence.
You know, personally, I don't...

55:29.440 --> 55:31.556
Now, there's nothing to be afraid of.

55:31.560 --> 55:34.518
They wouldn't dare do anything
to a US Marshal.

55:36.600 --> 55:38.556
Here they come now! Stop 'em!

55:52.480 --> 55:54.436
Well, gentlemen, a toast.

55:54.480 --> 55:57.438
To our own beloved Marshal P Knutt,

55:57.480 --> 56:00.517
accidentally run over today
by a band of unknown horsemen, RIP.

56:00.520 --> 56:02.397
(Laughter)

56:02.440 --> 56:04.431
(Wolf whistling)

56:05.440 --> 56:06.589
What's the matter?

56:19.400 --> 56:20.435
(Growls)

56:20.480 --> 56:23.392
# The night is young

56:23.440 --> 56:25.590
# And we're not too old

56:26.360 --> 56:29.511
# Why wait for fate to give you a shove?

56:31.560 --> 56:34.393
# When I am yours

56:34.520 --> 56:37.353
# To have and to hold

56:37.560 --> 56:41.473
# This is the night for love

56:42.600 --> 56:45.558
# For I am willing

56:45.600 --> 56:47.556
# And awfully weak

56:47.600 --> 56:52.469
# And just the kind to take advantage of

56:54.440 --> 56:56.431
# So why not push

56:56.560 --> 56:59.597
# Your new lucky streak?

56:59.600 --> 57:04.435
# This is the night for love

57:04.480 --> 57:07.358
# My arms are yearning

57:07.400 --> 57:09.595
# To hold you ever so near

57:10.360 --> 57:12.476
# My lips are burning

57:12.520 --> 57:14.556
# Just for your kiss

57:15.560 --> 57:18.472
# There's no returning

57:18.480 --> 57:21.472
# To me it's all very clear

57:21.480 --> 57:26.349
# There'll never be another night like this

57:27.600 --> 57:30.478
# So hold me close

57:30.520 --> 57:33.557
# Till daylight is near

57:33.560 --> 57:38.350
# Closer than a hand in a glove

57:39.560 --> 57:42.358
# And say those words

57:42.400 --> 57:44.550
# I'm longing to hear

57:44.560 --> 57:49.554
# This is the night for holding me tight

57:49.600 --> 57:51.511
# For this

57:54.400 --> 57:58.473
# Is the night for love

58:05.560 --> 58:07.437
I didn't know you could sing.

58:07.480 --> 58:10.438
Well, I've hardly seen anything of you
since I arrived.

58:10.440 --> 58:12.431
Have you er...been avoiding me?

58:12.480 --> 58:15.472
I should say not.
I got a lot of business to do lately.

58:15.520 --> 58:18.353
- At night?
- Why, it's the most convenient time.

58:18.400 --> 58:19.469
My customers are asleep then.

58:19.480 --> 58:25.396
Say, it's er...awful crowded in here.
Is there somewhere private we could...talk?

58:25.440 --> 58:29.558
Yep. My office.
I got a nice big couch there for sitting, talking on.

58:29.560 --> 58:31.437
Well, what are we waiting for, then?

58:31.480 --> 58:34.358
Well, you go right ahead. I gotta get something.

58:34.400 --> 58:35.469
OK.

58:38.440 --> 58:41.512
Charlie, quick. Come on, Charlie!
Gimme a bottle.

58:41.560 --> 58:44.358
Sure thing, Kid. Champagne?

58:44.400 --> 58:45.515
What else?

58:49.560 --> 58:52.518
- You...you can't go to her, Johnny.
- Don't talk so silly.

58:52.560 --> 58:56.394
Don't turn our story into a burning tale of lust,
jealousy and passion

58:56.440 --> 58:57.589
under a white-hot desert sun.

58:57.600 --> 59:01.513
Don't make it a saga of sex, vengeance
and sudden death in the primitive West.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.391
Are you delirious?

59:03.400 --> 59:06.551
But, Johnny, she's no good.
Take it from me, she's after something.

59:06.600 --> 59:09.398
If you get out of the way, she's gonna get it.

59:09.400 --> 59:11.436
But, Johnny, have you forgotten?

59:11.440 --> 59:12.555
I'm your little Ding Dong.

59:12.600 --> 59:15.558
I hate to have to say it,
but your Ding has lost its Dong.

59:18.520 --> 59:21.478
(Sniggers) Reckon you lost him, Belle.

59:21.480 --> 59:24.597
How about doing a...little something for me, eh?
Heh heh!

59:24.600 --> 59:27.353
- OK.
- Hee hee hee!

59:28.400 --> 59:30.391
(Laughter)

59:34.560 --> 59:36.437
Here's to us.

59:41.400 --> 59:43.356
Oh, no, Johnny. No, don't.

59:43.400 --> 59:45.470
Annie, I'd do anything.
I'd buy you diamonds, furs.

59:45.520 --> 59:47.511
I'll make you a partner. I'll shave every day.

59:47.520 --> 59:49.431
I know, but, you see, it's no use.

59:49.480 --> 59:52.392
- I'm saving myself for another.
- Another what?

59:52.400 --> 59:54.391
- Another man.
- Who?

59:54.440 --> 59:57.477
The man who killed the man who killed my man.

59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.557
- I got lost. Would you mind repeating that?
- OK, I'll try and explain.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.434
You see, there once was a Sheriff here
called Earp - Albert Earp.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.475
What about him?

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.513
Well, a long time ago,
he once shot somebody very dear to me,

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.551
and I just long for somebody to kill Earp.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.357
They have. He's dead.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.552
I know. And whoever it was that shot Earp
is the one I'm saving myself for.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.558
You see,
I have nothing else to offer as a reward.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.551
It was me. I shot the old codger.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.556
- You're...
- The man who killed the man

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.437
who killed your man.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.556
Oh, I hoped it would be you.
My search is ended.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.591
You can stop saving yourself now.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.555
- Oh, no. no. Not this way!
- What other way is there?

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.398
I mean, not here. Not here in an office.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.591
Come to my room at ten o'clock
and er...I'll be waiting for you.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.398
- Your room?
- Uh-huh.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.431
- Ten o'clock?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.471
You'll be waiting?

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.436
Mm-hmm.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.555
(Growls)

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.477
What are you doing?

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.557
That ain't fair! They said you were dead!

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.518
A fine doctor you turned out to be.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.472
No, he was dead when I took his pulse.
I swear it.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.393
- When you took his pulse?
- I never thought of that. My watch has stopped.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.555
What happened?

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:19.394
Rumpo and his gang,
they rode their horses right over you.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.398
Well, that does it.
I've had just about enough of Rumpo.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.470
I'll get something on him if it's the last thing I do.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.432
- It probably will be.
- Yeah!

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.595
We're here.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.396
Oh, good. What's on the clock?

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.590
Little Heap make no charge for his own father.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.353
Oh, that's a good boy.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.552
Well, now you run along home - straight home.
No stopping to pick up any stray bits of scalp.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.478
You take big risk, going in saloon, Father.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.472
Rumpo say he kill you if he see you again.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.432
Well, I can't help that. I've got to have fire water.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.358
How you buy fire water with no dollars?

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.439
Ah-ha-ha. Big Heap has inherited
all the cunning of his forefathers.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.595
Give me a hand, son.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.431
Gold strike at Bear Creek!

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.478
It never fails. It never fails.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.549
Ooh!

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.437
Ho ho ho!

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.557
One minute to ten.
Her room, and she'll be waiting.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.515
(Growls)

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.396
- Oh, hello.
- How.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.555
Who's that?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.478
It's me - Rumpo. Are you ready?

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.550
Could you wait just one moment, honey?

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.556
OK. Come on in.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.437
BIG HEAP: <i>Down with Custer!</i>

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.439
Big Heap. Just a minute, sweetheart.
I forgot something.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.433
BIG HEAP: <i>Let's all go and hold up the stage!</i>

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.471
Big Heap. What the heck are you doing here?

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.478
- It's my old friend - the Crumpet Kid.
- Rumpo Kid.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.517
Same thing. I say, remember you got me
to hold up that stage coach?

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.551
Shut up. You want the whole town to hear?

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.592
What is this? Where is everybody?

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.353
Charlie! What's going on? Where you been?

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.439
I'm sorry, Kid. Some joker came in, shouting
that there was a gold strike at Bear Creek.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.359
- Was there?
- I got three miles before I remembered,

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.436
there ain't no place called Bear Creek.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.473
Big Heap take heap big paleface mickey.
(Laughs)

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.398
It was him. I'll kill him!

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.396
No, no. I don't want no trouble, not now.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.591
I've got some important business waiting.
Lock him up in the office.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.551
- Get him out of here. Quick.
- (Laughs)

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.353
KNUTT: <i>Hold it right there, Rumpo</i>.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.549
Now what?

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.550
- Marshal.
- That's right. I want to talk to you.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.478
OK. Drop by tomorrow. I'm kinda busy right now.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.596
Are you gonna walk down
or do I have to shoot you down?

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.475
OK.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.557
Fantastic.
A fella can't even live up to his name these days.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:31.359
- What do you want?
- Rumpo... (Gulps) I'm taking you in.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.473
- You couldn't take in dirty washing.
- You heard me. I'm taking you in.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.439
If you feel like trying to stop me, just you try it.
I'm ready for you.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.469
(Thud)

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:42.391
I told you that was too loose.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.436
I can't wear it any tighter. It pinches me tummy.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:50.509
Oh, you can laugh, Rumpo,
but we've really got something on you this time.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.551
Go on, Marshal, you tell him.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.519
Well, it seems that last night Colonel Houston's
ranch was raided again by rustlers.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.518
- What's that got to do with me?
- That's got a lot to do with you.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.471
They got away with 40 cows.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.516
- Bullocks.
- I know what I'm talking about.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.516
So do I. They was bullocks.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.399
Oh, what does it matter
if they was cows or bullocks?

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.392
- It matters to them.
- Oh, this ain't getting us nowhere.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.351
Now, take a look at this.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:21.431
This here hide came off a Bar X steer,
and we found it in your stable.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.472
Yeah, and that ain't all.
The hoof prints on the back of my coat

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.471
match up with those of your horse.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.512
You may as well admit it, Rumpo.
You stole his cattle.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:32.438
We've got you by the shorthorns.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.513
I'd like to help you, but unfortunately I loaned
my horse to somebody else last night.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.437
What?

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.351
Where were you?

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.517
Here, all night.
Belle will tell you what I was doing.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.596
Not in my court, she won't.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.515
I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the fella you want
is the fella that used my horse last night.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.348
- Who was it?
- An Injun, name of Big Heap.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:57.437
Oh. Well, it looks like
we've got the wrong man, Judge.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.472
That's right. If you'll pardon me,
I got business to attend to.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.517
Yeah, but just you watch it, Rumpo,
because I aim to get you.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.552
Yeah, you'll see. We'll get something on you yet.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.433
That's far enough, Marshal.
Shall I plug 'em, Kid?

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.517
- Nope.
- Yes. Go on, let him! Go on, Charlie.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.398
- Hey, steady, Judge.
- That's exactly what we want.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.550
Then we'll have something on them.
Use your nut, Knutt.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.388
Oh, Judge. You know we got more sense
than to shoot a US Marshal.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.513
Charlie was only kidding. Now, would you get
out of here, please? We're closing for the night.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:28.393
All right! But we'll be back!

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.550
- Now?
- No! Get out, you old fool!

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.549
Come on.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.511
Well, here we go.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.553
I heard you in there, Kid. That was a smart trick,
saying Big Heap stole those steers.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.512
Yeah. But if the Marshal talks to him,
we're in trouble.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.555
Like me to get rid of him?

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.354
Later. Just keep him locked up for now.
I gotta see Miss Oakley.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.595
- Why? What's she done?
- Nothing yet. That's the trouble.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.591
CHARLIE: <i>Hey, Kid! Kid! Big Heap's gone!</i>

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.591
This just ain't my night.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.476
He must have got out through the window.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.398
Don't just stand there.
He can't be far away. Come on.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.471
- Up the Indians!
- Here, you can't do that.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.475
We gotta get him out of there quick.

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:35.392
It's not gonna be easy,
with that Marshal sleeping there.

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:37.510
No. We'll have to keep him occupied.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.358
Why did this have to happen tonight?

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.473
I'll get Curly and the boys. You tell Miss Oakley
I've been unavoidably detained.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.350
Leave it to me, Kid.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:56.549
(Knock on door)

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.430
Come and get it.

01:08:59.439 --> 01:09:01.430
(Gunfire)

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.397
(Crashing below)

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:10.468
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I-I-I thought you were somebody else. Oh.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.430
Good night, Mum.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.470
(Knock on door)

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.431
Yes?

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.357
Just hold it right there.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.594
I hope that's your gun, Marshal.

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.479
Miss Belle. What are you doing here?
Think of your reputation.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.398
<i>You</i> think about it
and stop asking stupid questions.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.391
Stop! What are you getting undressed for?

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.590
- I wanna catch up with you.
- What? Ooh!

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.392
Oh, you don't have to be so modest with me,
Marshal.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.436
You're a fine-looking man, you know.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.398
- I am?
- Yeah. I kinda go for men who wear long-coms.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.352
I knew a fella who escaped from prison
in a pair of coms.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.391
He got out through the trap door at the back.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.476
Yes. Coms really do something to me.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.511
They do something to me, too. Itch.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.393
You didn't come here
just to talk about underwear.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.352
- You're right, Marshall. How would you like it...
- Oh, no.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.597
..if I gave you proof that Rumpo was behind
the stage hold-up and the cattle rustling?

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.433
What? But why are you telling me all this?

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.550
Maybe it's because I go for you, Marshal, honey.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.388
Don't you feel it,
that certain something between us?

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.550
Yes. It's my hot water bottle.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.551
No, we were meant for each other, you and me.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.591
We go together like ham and eggs.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.556
- Oh, Mother.
- (Knock on door)

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.398
What was that? Are you expecting anyone?

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.510
- No, of course not.
- If it's Rumpo, he'll kill me.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.471
- I must hide.
- Where?

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.476
- Under the bed. Quick.
- Good idea.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.431
No, not you, you fool. Me.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.478
- Miss Oakley.
- Marshal, I've come to give myself up.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.433
- I've just killed a man.
- Well, we all make silly mistakes now and...

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.431
- Killed a man?
- Uh-huh.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.398
Charlie the barman.
But it was an accident, I swear it.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.555
Of course it was. How did it happen?

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.433
- I shot him with a shotgun...
- Oh.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.516
..a rifle, and two revolvers.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.516
- It must have been some accident.
- It was.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.516
I thought it was the Rumpo Kid.

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.439
You see, I found out tonight
that he was the one that killed Sheriff Earp.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.516
Oh, Marsh, I feel just...terrible.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.597
Oh, there, there. Don't worry about it.
Come and sit down for a minute.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.433
Ahh! Oh!

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.357
My gun.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.551
You're very sweet.
I feel sort of safe with you somehow.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.511
That's what they all say.

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.358
Oh, have you known lots of girls, then?

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.472
Oh, no. No, none at all. It's my job, I suppose.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.596
You don't get to meet them down drains.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.591
Well, I'm glad because I've never felt like this
about anybody before.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.554
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.559
I feel like we sort of go together like...
strawberries and cream.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.398
BELLE: <i>Or ham and eggs.</i>
- Yeah, or...

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.597
- Oh, Lord.
- I'm sorry, Marshal, but I can't lie there,

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.555
listening to this witch
talking out the back of her bustle.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.433
- No other girls, huh?
- Wait a minute. I can explain.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.391
Oh, don't bother.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.476
And with an old bag like that.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.516
And who are you calling an old bag?

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.398
You, old bag, I'm calling an old bag.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.510
Ahh! You cat. I'll get you! Ahh!

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.351
(Shrieking and yelling)

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.397
(Thudding against wall)

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.476
Ahh!

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.471
Think of the neighbours.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.555
Ladies, please.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.434
Now, look what you've done.
Oh, I'm sorry, Marshal, really, I am.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.391
Marsh, honey, are you all right?

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.391
There, there. Belle will make it up to you.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.594
Take your hands off him, you big troll!

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.588
Look, you leave him alone, you harpy!

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.351
I said I can take care of him, you cowgirl.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.550
Cowgirl? If I called you that, I'd only be half right.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.556
Why, you...

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.391
Oh. Oh, Marsh. Marsh, honey.

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.357
LITTLE HEAP: <i>There he is.</i>

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.392
- I get-um quick.
- Not so fast. I'll handle this.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.437
- Me want-um Daddy.
- We going to get-um Daddy.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.396
Now, shut-um up-um.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.589
- Dolores, come here.
- What?

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.513
Get yourself into the Marshal's office.
Keep him occupied for half an hour.

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.472
- How?
- What do you want - diagrams?

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.393
Well, half an hour's a long time.
What are we gonna talk about?

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.477
- I should have known better.
- Ugh.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.472
Remember the things your ma told you not to do
when you came out West?

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.357
- Yes.
- Do 'em.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.432
There, there, my poor boy.
Leave him alone. He's mine.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.357
- He's mine!
- He's mine!

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.594
No, please, ladies!

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.353
(Knock on door)
- Rumpo!

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.351
Shh.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.432
Why, hello there, you old Marshal, honey.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.436
W-W-What is this? W-W-What do you want?

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.552
Now, that's not a nice way to talk
to a little old girl who's dropped by

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.591
just to keep y'all from getting lonesome.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.396
Oh, I've been anything but lonesome.

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.589
Don't be like that, Marshal, honey.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.394
Why, since the first time I saw you,
I've been crazy about y'all.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.393
You and me, we'll go together
like pancakes and syrup, I reckon.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.396
All you people think about is food.

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.590
Doesn't anyone around here
go together like man and woman?

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:14.478
Now you're talking my kind of language.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.476
Oh, no, no! No, stay away!

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.516
Ahh!
Ahh!

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.398
Land sakes, what are they all doing here?

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.351
You get out of here, you little tramp!

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:28.359
Well, don't you worry. I don't aim on sharing him
with a couple of old hags like you.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.356
I got my pride.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.391
Why, you...

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.396
(Shrieks)

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.515
Oh, no, you don't!

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.472
(Shrieking)

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.517
I know it's the Wild West,
but this is ridiculous.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.470
Do you want to be a hero?
Stick that in the keyhole.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.515
Keyhole?

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.552
Yeah, keyhole... Er keyhole-um.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:03.515
Ah, keyhole-um. Why you no say?
White man speak with forked tongue.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.590
- Well, go on. It's only a half-minute fuse.
- Oh.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.592
Soon as it blows, we get Big Heap
and get out of town fast.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.516
No can stick in keyhole-um.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.357
Key in keyhole-um.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.469
Well, take the key out.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.549
Ah.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.558
"Key in keyhole-um." Oh, no. Come back!

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.469
Here is key-um.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.432
- Quiet. Quiet.
- Well, what is it?

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.555
I thought I heard something.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.475
Little Heap?

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.431
Where the heck is he?

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.356
Ha ha ha ha!

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.437
What a send-up.
Get Big Heap. Let's get out of here.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.555
Big Heap.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.555
Would you believe it?

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.431
Big Heap. Come on, wake up.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.436
You girls stay here. Understand?

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.555
All right, carry him out.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.596
Oh, no, you don't. Stick 'em up. Get back in.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.351
Go on, get back. Back. Now. Reach.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.592
So that's your little game, eh?
Trying to help a prisoner escape.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.554
Just one more charge against you, Rumpo.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:22.479
What do you mean, Marshal?
We just dropped in for a friendly visit, that's all.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.351
We ain't done nothin' wrong.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.597
Nothing wrong? Holding up the stage,
cattle-rustling, shooting a Sheriff.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.396
- You're crazy.
- Don't you believe it.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.431
I've all the evidence in there, and witnesses.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:36.388
Don't you try it, Rumpo. Just you try it.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.557
I'm not a fool, you know.
I know what I'm doing. I'm holding you all.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.393
Right. In there, all of you.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.476
Go on. And take him with you. Go on, inside.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.511
You mean, in there?

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.556
Yes. Now, get a move on,
before I lose my temper.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.388
Well, come on, boys, you heard the Marshal.
Get in there.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.436
Everybody inside. Come on, move.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.391
That's the idea.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.550
You picked the wrong man
to tangle with this time, Rumpo.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.556
- Now, where's the key?
- Right here.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.478
- What? Oh.
- And I'll take that, too, I think.

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.479
You know, Marshal, you were right.
You're too smart for the likes of us.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.471
I'm just gonna get out of Stodge City.

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.358
But wait a minute. Come back.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.516
No, please. Somebody, help!

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.356
(Laughs goofily)

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.391
We've got him for you, Rumpo.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.515
Bring him in.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.591
- Big Heap.
- (Grumbles)

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.591
Oop! Ohhh!

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.554
Ahh! Ohh!

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.431
Ooh!

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.592
Confidentially,
Big Heap have heap big hang-um-over.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.475
Get out of here. Go on home.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.590
Ohh! Do you mean I'm not a prisoner any more?

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.558
Nope. You can't tell the Marshal
any more than he knows already?

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.516
Get in there.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:03.473
Ohh! How absolutely lovely.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.479
Do you mind? You see,
I've always wanted a scalp with a bobble on.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.397
Get out of here. Go home.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.476
Uncivilised lot.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.349
What is the meaning of this outrage?
Why have I been brought here?

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.549
Shut up. Sit down.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.433
What are you getting so excited about?

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.433
What am I getting excited about?
Taken from my bed at gunpoint.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.516
Not even allowed to put my flippers on.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.354
Have you ever tried riding a horse barefoot?
It hurts.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.550
It could have been worse.
You might have been in the bath.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.390
Gagged and blindfolded,
with a revoltingly filthy handkerchief.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.431
I hate to think where that had been.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.438
I couldn't have you knowing
where my hide-out was, could I?

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.392
I don't know what you've got to hide out from,
I'm sure.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.516
Don't you know what happened in town
last night?

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.511
Somebody ratted on me

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.394
and now the Marshal has got more than enough
on me to string me up.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.513
Oh, really?
Well, I had to go out of town last night.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.556
We found him at the widow Rawlins' place.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:04.429
You dirty old man. You're supposed
to be dead against that sort of thing.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:09.508
I happen to be her lawyer. Ever since her
husband died, I've been handling everything.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.397
I bet you have.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:15.399
This is insufferable.
Why have you brought me here, I say?

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:18.398
Well, Judge, I'll tell you.
We're gonna make a deal.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:22.558
You get rid of that Marshal...
and I will give you a rake-off.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:25.358
- A what-off?
- A rake-off.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.595
A percentage of everything I get
from running Stodge.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.479
Are you attempting to bribe me - a judge,

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:37.516
a dedicated defender of law and order,
a sworn enemy of crime and corruption?

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.511
- Yep.
- How much?

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.516
- A quarter.
- I'll take it.

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.398
Provided you get rid of the Marshal.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.477
- He ain't really a Marshal at all.
- What?

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:54.511
No. It was all a mistake.
He's really a sanitary engineer. Ha ha!

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:58.348
Are you trying to tell me -
Johnny Finger, the Rumpo Kid -

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.517
that I have been run out of town by a...

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.397
..plumber?

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.398
Yeah! You can see the funny side of it.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.509
Shut up!

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.348
The deal's off. I'll take care of him myself.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.517
I'll fill him so full of holes
they'll use him for straining cabbage.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.391
Ha ha ha!

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.516
How nice. Well, if you'll excuse me...

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.556
Not so fast. I ain't finished with you yet.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.398
CROWD: We want Knutt!

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:28.479
Patience, folks! Patience! Patience!
He'll be out any minute now.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:31.478
Any minute?
You've been saying that since one this morning.

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:35.359
- We're doing the best we can, Marshal.
- Why are those people out there, anyway?

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.517
Don't you know? You're a hero.
Rumpo and his boys have moved out.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.478
Some hero. Locked in one of his own cells.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.472
Teach you to come in here
and ask me for a quick one.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.433
Hey, Marsh, the Rumpo Kid's got Judge Burke.

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:12.472
- What are they gonna do to him?
- I don't know, but I don't like it.

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.397
You have to get out of Stodge.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.352
Get out of Stodge? I can't even get out of here!

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.594
Ok, fellas, just stand aside.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.511
Gosh, that was marvellous, Annie.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:27.553
- I would never have thought of doing that.
- <i>Marshal! Marshal, come quick!</i>

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:30.393
- What is it?
- Look.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.556
- It's Judge Burke.
- So it is.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.398
- Is he...? Is he...?
- No, he ain't.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.436
Get me off this thing, will you?

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.438
You're OK, Judge.
Just plumb exhausted, that's all.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.552
So would you be if you'd been riding like this
for four hours,

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.553
with the hot sun beating down
upon your...progress.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.397
Ohh!

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.589
Ohh!

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.397
What happened to you, Judge?

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:02.438
Rumpo and his men. They're coming to get you.

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.438
- Who? Me?
- Yeah, they know you're not a real Marshal.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.438
They're gonna be here
at 12 o'clock high noon.

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.555
High noon? Why high noon?

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:13.479
I know. I told them it was a most unoriginal time
for that kind of thing.

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.557
But they wouldn't listen. Ohh!

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:20.479
Well, you all heard what the Judge said.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.559
Rumpo and his men,
they'll be coming back to Stodge at 12.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:30.391
Now, I reckon if we all stand together,
we could...

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.358
Wait. Doc, you'll stand up with me, won't you?

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:36.551
Well, I'd like to, son, but I'm a kind of busy man.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.471
Got a lot of calls to make.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.589
Josh?

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.512
Well, it looks like I'm gonna be
kinda busy myself.

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.439
But you don't need to worry.
I already got your measurements.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.471
It's useless.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.478
Marshal, you must get out of here.
It's only ten o'clock.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.479
No. I may not be a real Marshal,
but I took this job and I aim to see it through.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:59.512
You can't take on Rumpo
and his whole gang single-handed.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.556
Well, you wouldn't think much of me
if I ran away.

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:05.434
And, anyway, I'm a pretty good shot.
Remember the Indians? Pow!

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:10.395
I never wanted to have to tell you this,
but...it was me that shot those Indians.

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.550
- You?
- Mm-hm. Through the stage window.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:17.355
Oh. That explains how I managed
to get three with two shots.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.549
Just a minute.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.477
(Sniffs)

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:24.559
Oh, yes. And it was you who saved me
from that hanging the other night?

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.549
You'd make some man a good husband.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.478
Oh, come on. You can't help being what you are.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.557
But just get out of here. Go back to your drains.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:36.472
Yes, that's about all I'm fit for, isn't it? Drains.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:39.549
Drains.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.477
Oh, wait a minute.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.555
<i>I've got it.</i>

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:45.393
Annie, could you teach me to shoot
as good as you?

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.479
What? They're due in at noon. It's after ten now.

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:52.392
Good. That gives us almost two hours.
Do you think I'm mad?

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:54.470
Nutty as a fruitcake.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.595
Agh.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.433
Oh, get off.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.515
Well, that's a bit better.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.551
- Any sign of them yet?
- No.

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.551
And there's only a minute to go.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:17.355
Oh, is that all?
Doesn't time fly when you're having fun?

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.550
Marsh, please,
you've got to let me go there with you.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.516
No. Definitely not.

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:24.552
It's time I started fighting for myself. I told you.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.471
Yes, I know.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.391
It's just that I love you.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.391
(Cuckoos)

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.509
How was that?

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.351
Ho ho ho!

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.435
Knutt!

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.396
<i>This is Rumpo!</i>

01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.555
I'm coming in!

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.596
Rumpo!

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.429
RUMPO: <i>Knutt.</i>

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.515
Where are you?

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.469
<i>Here, Rumpo!</i>

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.353
Knutt! Where are you?

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.515
<i>Come out and fight, damn you!</i>

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.472
Curly, you take that end.
Slim, you and me take the other.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.391
Look out behind you!

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:21.549
Knutt. Where are you?

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.515
Here, Rumpo!

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.556
No, here!

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.594
No, here!

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.476
(Revolvers click)

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.471
Just hold it right there, Rumpo.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.358
Now...now, Marshal, er, sir.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.472
You don't want to shoot me.
Me and the boys were only kidding.

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.397
I'm not going to shoot you, Rumpo.

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.516
I'm going to put you where you belong -
on the end of a rope.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.357
Johnny, I'm coming!

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.396
- Stop, or I'll fire!
- (Revolver clicks)

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.512
Marsh. Oh, Marsh, I think you're wonderful.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:05.351
Come here.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.516
I'd have got him, too,
but I haven't any bullets left.

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:09.595
(Gunshot)

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.395
Ooh!
