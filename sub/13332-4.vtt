WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.374 --> 00:09.342
Newcastle done.

00:09.409 --> 00:10.643
Cancun done.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.346
Australia, you're getting done.

00:14.414 --> 00:17.250
The Geordies are going Down Under.
To Australia!

00:17.317 --> 00:20.286
And deep into the bush.
(all scream)

00:22.188 --> 00:24.591
Throw another shrimp on the barbie.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.963
Can't even have five minute craic
with the lads

00:30.029 --> 00:32.131
without them getting birds in.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.902
No-one wants them here any more.
(all argue)

00:35.969 --> 00:39.506
This is more Charlotte turning
everyone else against us.

00:39.572 --> 00:42.976
You could put me and Scott on
the moon, we'd still find birds.

00:43.042 --> 00:46.479
I'm sick of this constant
competition between Gaz and Scott.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.182
Howay, lads. Who's the alpha male?

00:49.249 --> 00:52.051
Gary and Scott are gonna have to
make the first move

00:52.118 --> 00:53.820
cos it's us pissed off at them.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.755
I'm sorry. Love youse.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.225
Friends?
Aye.

00:59.292 --> 01:01.828
I'm pleased
we're starting to make progress.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.498
It's our new boss.
Shearer, Shearer!

01:05.565 --> 01:10.036
I've knew before I came here
that Joel was gonna come.

01:10.103 --> 01:13.606
I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be able to do it.

01:13.673 --> 01:16.476
Voulez vous tash on avec moi, pet?

01:21.448 --> 01:23.616
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.852
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.054
I won't kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:28.121 --> 01:30.089
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:30.156 --> 01:32.058
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.828
I'm fake, flirty and I've got FFs.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.996
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:37.063 --> 01:39.399
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:49.509 --> 01:51.578
(Sophie) Last night was really nice.

01:51.644 --> 01:54.214
I got to chill out
and it was nice for us to bond.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.619
I woke up next to Gary

01:59.686 --> 02:02.522
and I think I'm the first girl
who can say that

02:02.589 --> 02:04.357
and not worry about an STI.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.600
My ex-boyfriend was a prick

02:13.666 --> 02:17.537
because I can't get over him
properly

02:17.604 --> 02:19.772
because I'm rushing it.

02:28.448 --> 02:33.219
I don't want to think about him
and I don't want to be hurt

02:33.286 --> 02:36.689
and I don't want to miss him
cos I don't know what I'm missing.

02:36.756 --> 02:38.124
It was horrible.

02:38.191 --> 02:43.997
You're still here, proving that
you're stronger than that

02:44.063 --> 02:47.667
and rocking out with all of us,
having mint nights out,

02:47.734 --> 02:51.004
confident, wearing what you want,
doing what you want,

02:51.070 --> 02:53.306
saying what you want
and having a laugh.

02:53.373 --> 02:56.643
For me it's weird being close
to any other girl in this house

02:56.709 --> 02:59.012
without having an argument about it.

02:59.078 --> 03:02.382
So now I actually am friends
with Vicky, I do get on with her.

03:02.448 --> 03:05.184
You are better off,
you know it, right?

03:05.251 --> 03:08.788
I don't know what it is about Gary.
I don't know if it's because

03:08.855 --> 03:12.725
him and Charlotte aren't ripping
each other apart.

03:12.792 --> 03:15.228
Thank you for being so nice to us.

03:15.295 --> 03:18.831
He's just being so fucking nice
and considerate and thoughtful.

03:35.515 --> 03:37.717
It's the day that
Joel's gonna get here.

03:37.784 --> 03:40.486
I have been waiting for this
for so long.

03:40.553 --> 03:44.090
I am fucking so excited and boom.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.426
(squeals)

03:46.492 --> 03:49.028
Joel's arrival
has made us so positive

03:49.095 --> 03:52.131
and I can't wait for me and him
to spend time together.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.168
I missed you.

03:57.236 --> 04:00.540
Even though people warmed to Joel,
in the back of their minds,

04:00.607 --> 04:03.409
I know they still think
he's the player he used to be.

04:03.476 --> 04:05.979
I want to prove that he's not
that boy any more

04:06.045 --> 04:07.680
and we're stronger than ever.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.692
There is just enough time
for me and the lads

04:19.759 --> 04:21.361
to fit in a cheeky gym session

04:21.427 --> 04:23.496
cos we need to keep
looking sculpted.

04:23.563 --> 04:27.533
In Australian gyms,
there is so much fanny.

04:31.404 --> 04:35.341
What the girls haven't twigged is
all these good-looking lads they see

04:35.408 --> 04:38.478
are training in our gym.
They need to get themselves here.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.118
I think the girls
should come to the gym more.

04:45.184 --> 04:49.088
They've got more chance of
pulling here than on a night out.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.205
I'm excited to see everybody.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.508
When I left,
everyone was fast asleep.

05:08.574 --> 05:11.411
Vicky is in Gary's room,
which is really weird.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.647
Scott is in the shag pad
which will probably be our bed,

05:14.714 --> 05:17.583
which is minging,
he shagged Holly the other night.

05:17.650 --> 05:21.988
Blood all over the sheets and shit.
Tan and blood and cum and whatever.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.792
It's beautiful, innit?
This is home.

05:28.594 --> 05:32.532
There's a fucking kangaroo.
There's me and you.

05:34.067 --> 05:37.770
Joel loves to piss everyone off
and he loves a good entrance

05:37.837 --> 05:39.505
so we've got to be loud.

05:39.572 --> 05:40.973
(Go.)

05:41.040 --> 05:45.344
(yells)

05:45.411 --> 05:47.480
It's your favourite boy from London.

05:47.547 --> 05:50.183
At first glance,
I honestly thought it was Jay.

05:50.249 --> 05:52.685
Like, "Yes!" Nah, it's fucking Joel.

05:52.752 --> 05:55.688
Joel can shove his pots and pans
up his fucking hoop.

05:55.755 --> 05:58.157
(both yell)

05:58.224 --> 06:00.960
I'm pleased.
James has someone to hang round with

06:01.027 --> 06:03.062
so he can stop pestering
me and Scott.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.798
I am pleased to see Joel

06:05.865 --> 06:08.601
but what the fuck is with
them skinny white pants?

06:08.668 --> 06:11.404
Thought I'd surprise you.
Sophie's got Joel now

06:11.471 --> 06:15.241
and James is missing Kate,
Charlotte is missing Mitch,

06:15.308 --> 06:18.578
and I just feel a little bit
fucking lonely, no-one misses me.

06:18.644 --> 06:21.781
It's just so sick.
So beautiful, isn't it?

06:21.848 --> 06:23.583
This is amazing.

06:23.649 --> 06:26.719
(Charlotte) Last night,
Gary and Vicky shared a room.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.322
It's just a bit weird
that they're so close now

06:29.388 --> 06:31.724
because before
they were total opposites

06:31.791 --> 06:34.627
and wouldn't even stand
in the same room together.

06:35.595 --> 06:39.966
On a serious note, Char, are you OK?
Are you feeling all right?

06:40.032 --> 06:43.770
I haven't been able to speak to him
and I don't know what's happening.

06:43.836 --> 06:45.838
It's really starting to get us down.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.708
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to stick this out.

06:48.775 --> 06:49.976
When I was with Ricci,

06:50.042 --> 06:53.079
the amount of times I had to leave
the house to be with him

06:53.146 --> 06:54.447
cos I missed him so much.

06:54.514 --> 06:57.617
Don't think I don't understand
where you're coming from.

06:57.683 --> 07:00.820
The person that I do care about
and do want to be with

07:00.887 --> 07:03.589
is all the way
on the other side of the world.

07:03.656 --> 07:07.059
She's trying so hard to prove
she's got no feelings for Gary

07:07.126 --> 07:08.961
and she wants Mitch's approval.

07:09.028 --> 07:14.333
Now Joel's here it's so much worse.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.637
She's left Mitch at home
and it's becoming obvious

07:17.703 --> 07:19.972
that's where she's left
some of herself.

07:20.039 --> 07:24.377
One day I would love Mitch
to be here making eggs with the lads

07:24.443 --> 07:27.280
cos I think he'd be good at
making eggs with the lads.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.215
He'd get on with them really well.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.618
Him and Gary would get on,
all they've got in common and that.

07:32.685 --> 07:33.686
(both laugh)

07:37.290 --> 07:39.492
We've decided
to go white water rafting.

07:39.559 --> 07:40.960
Get everyone together...

07:41.027 --> 07:44.831
Why are youse making me do this?
...and just fucking go mad.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.167
Who's excited
for white water rafting?

07:48.234 --> 07:50.269
I'm excited!
(all cheer)

07:50.336 --> 07:51.637
We're here, look.

07:54.073 --> 07:55.208
Enjoy.

08:00.112 --> 08:01.514
This is fucking mint.

08:16.762 --> 08:19.665
So Charlotte's gone overboard
and I start to worry.

08:21.801 --> 08:25.771
The current's sweeping us under,
I'm getting bashed off every rock.

08:28.107 --> 08:30.676
It just looks like
a big floater on the toilet.

08:30.743 --> 08:34.212
I feel like I'm back in the womb
and me mam's giving birth again

08:34.280 --> 08:36.816
and I just don't know what to do.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.318
(James)
That was actually fucking mint.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.568
You don't want the shit.
Don't want the shit.

08:55.635 --> 08:59.038
Me and Charlotte are really happy
for Sophie that Joel's here

08:59.105 --> 09:01.974
but we are starting to miss
Kate and Mitch.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.744
I hope that one time
she'll be able to come out

09:04.810 --> 09:07.613
and then like,
fucking Holly and that will just...

09:07.680 --> 09:10.082
I want them all
to forget about everything.

09:10.149 --> 09:11.984
Me and Holly now are getting on.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.820
But I don't want to bring her
into the drama

09:14.887 --> 09:17.123
cos she doesn't deserve it really.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.330
The only way the girls will
ever do any exercise

09:24.397 --> 09:26.198
is if it involves a lad who's fit

09:26.265 --> 09:28.901
and them dolled up
pretending to exercise.

09:28.968 --> 09:32.338
So I've got a personal trainer
to come give the girls a session.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.406
Hi.
Hello.

09:33.472 --> 09:37.176
Are you all right? I'm here
to give you your special workout.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.746
So I open the door and I'm like...

09:40.813 --> 09:43.082
Hi, this is our instructor.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.851
The big bastard can
barely get through the door.

09:45.918 --> 09:50.189
He's got shoulders like that.
He is fucking beautiful.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.691
Swoon.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.327
Hi, Dan, I'm Charlotte.
Lovely to meet you.

09:54.393 --> 09:56.762
I can tell Holly and Vicky
both fancy Dan.

09:56.829 --> 10:00.466
I can see their clits throbbing
underneath their jogging pants.

10:05.671 --> 10:09.642
Holly is, like, spraying her fucking
wild pheromones everywhere.

10:17.383 --> 10:20.886
I've got no idea how I'm gonna
exercise in front of this man.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.089
Me knees have gone weak.

10:23.155 --> 10:27.626
30 minutes, easy, job done.
That was fine, wasn't it?

10:27.693 --> 10:30.429
It was all right.
See you again soon.

10:30.496 --> 10:33.265
I'm being very ladylike,
giving him a handshake.

10:33.332 --> 10:35.868
Holly goes over
and kisses him on the face.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.937
Bye, Dan.
See you, darling.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.839
I just want him to come back.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.975
(chuckles) Dan!

10:54.253 --> 10:56.222
Whoo! Are you ready?

10:56.288 --> 10:58.257
(all whoop)
Yes, I am.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.726
I can't wait to go out,
have a drink in me hand

11:00.793 --> 11:02.395
and just have a good time.

11:16.108 --> 11:19.545
It's so funny to watch the
relationship between Gary and Scott.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.754
The friendship is mainly
based on competition.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.860
Gaz is telling me we're competition.

11:34.927 --> 11:37.196
I know exactly
where you're coming from.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.738
The music is so loud
it's hurting me head.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.373
I don't want to be here.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.976
None of wor are enjoying
this club so we're gonna go home.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.711
Shock, the bucking squad stay.

12:03.289 --> 12:06.492
Never in a million years
I thought a Geordie lass like me

12:06.559 --> 12:08.894
could go out with
a southern lad like Joel.

12:08.961 --> 12:11.730
This is the perfect way
to start my first night.

12:11.797 --> 12:14.366
This is the best time
I have ever had, you know.

12:14.433 --> 12:17.303
We're so different,
but at the same time, it works

12:17.369 --> 12:19.105
because opposites attract.

12:23.976 --> 12:27.780
Marriage, getting engaged, anything
like that, he freaks the fuck out.

12:27.847 --> 12:30.249
I live in Newcastle,
you live in London

12:30.316 --> 12:34.787
and it's just easier
for me to live with you.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.656
We'll see, man.
You'll think about it?

12:37.723 --> 12:39.158
And a dog.

12:40.793 --> 12:43.162
Here we go.
I know what's coming next.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.798
And then the child.
(laughs)

12:45.865 --> 12:49.735
So I'm gonna wind him up and I'm just
gonna play along that I want a baby.

12:49.802 --> 12:52.271
But it's true, I do want a baby.
Maybe in a year.

13:07.319 --> 13:09.755
Now that they've gone,
it's time to have fun.

13:13.359 --> 13:17.096
Drinks, girls, music, dance.
This is what Sydney is all about.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.487
I've been up all morning.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.561
I understand that Joel's flown
halfway round the world

13:48.627 --> 13:50.563
but I'm tired and I can't be arsed.

14:01.907 --> 14:04.944
There's no-one watching wor
and no-one giving wor shit

14:05.010 --> 14:06.612
and talking utter bollocks.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.847
We can just pull and instantly we do.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.820
This is just standard procedure.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.323
I'm smashed in a club,
necking on with a bird,

14:17.389 --> 14:20.559
Scott's on me right, it is
what we are meant to be doing.

14:20.626 --> 14:23.762
Me and Gaz have got girls
and we're ready to take them home

14:23.829 --> 14:26.065
but mine won't leave
without her friend.

14:26.966 --> 14:31.904
OK, OK, OK.
Don't worry. I'll dust her as well.

14:45.484 --> 14:47.386
(they giggle)

14:50.723 --> 14:54.193
It's not everyday Zeus lets
two people drink from his fountain.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.868
First threesome in Australia
boxed off.

15:09.975 --> 15:13.846
Get bucked and fucking love it.
I've got something to tell the guys.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.481
Let's go.
Fucking hell.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.449
I want Dan to touch us.

15:17.516 --> 15:21.287
Joel's like, "What's going on?"
Babies shouldn't have babies.

15:21.353 --> 15:22.988
I can't do another week.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.524
Gary is getting beaten
at his own game.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.559
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

15:29.995 --> 15:30.195
.

15:32.731 --> 15:32.931
.

15:55.921 --> 15:59.992
Last night, absolutely epic.
First threesome, tick.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.663
Me and Scott,
no hassle, no drama, no arguments,

16:04.730 --> 16:08.634
literally, birds, home,
drink, bang, up, bye, done.

16:09.435 --> 16:12.571
We're saying bye and you can tell
they've had a good night

16:12.638 --> 16:14.773
cos they're walking like a rooster.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.915
What happened last night?
Did youse pull?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.519
None of us wanted
to stay in that club

16:27.586 --> 16:30.923
to just watch the boys be like
little meerkats around the club

16:30.989 --> 16:33.158
searching for a half-decent lass.

16:33.225 --> 16:36.462
But how did you just find them
in that dark space?

16:36.528 --> 16:39.298
(laughter)
To be fair, that club was so weird.

16:39.365 --> 16:44.036
The last thing I want to do is be
out in a club watching them pull.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.709
It's getting hard on nights out
now Joel's here.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.946
Vicky will be tashing on,
Holly will be trying to pull,

16:54.012 --> 16:56.215
Scott and Gary will both be
with girls

16:56.281 --> 17:00.652
and Sophie and Joel will be loved up
in the corner and I'm alone.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.534
Hello?
"Hello."

17:15.601 --> 17:16.602
Are you all right?

17:16.667 --> 17:21.940
I've been missing Kate and I wish
I could bring her into the house

17:22.007 --> 17:25.810
but I know I can't cos things will
kick off again with her and Holly

17:25.877 --> 17:27.813
and I don't want that any more.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.348
Are you missing us?

17:30.883 --> 17:31.884
How much?

17:35.254 --> 17:36.855
Would you come over here?

17:39.525 --> 17:41.760
It will.
I'll try and make it happen.

17:41.827 --> 17:44.029
Being in the house
is important for us

17:44.096 --> 17:47.499
but so is me relationship
and I think it's better for everyone

17:47.566 --> 17:49.668
if I keep them
both separate for now.

17:49.735 --> 17:53.305
Have a nice sleep
and I'll give you a ring soon, OK?

18:06.385 --> 18:08.454
It's raining
and I'm at work tonight.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.055
Thank fuck it's a party bus.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.658
James can line them up
and I'll knock them down.

18:12.724 --> 18:17.362
Party bus tonight,
you'll have a right laugh.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.669
(Dan) Morning.

18:23.735 --> 18:27.339
For a change, we've decided to go
down the beach and have a workout

18:27.406 --> 18:31.043
and we're bringing Vicky and Holly.
This should be interesting.

18:31.109 --> 18:33.078
You all right? What we doing today?

18:33.145 --> 18:35.247
What have you done?

18:35.314 --> 18:37.049
The weather is absolutely shit

18:37.115 --> 18:39.985
and they wanna start
running round doing press ups.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.421
I've got a bad hand, fuck doing this.

18:42.488 --> 18:45.357
So you're gonna do some stairs,
a bit of beach stuff.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.092
We'll make it short and sharp.

18:47.159 --> 18:50.662
Me and Sophie decided to pie it off.
We're gonna watch Dan work out.

18:50.729 --> 18:53.265
Let's go.
That beautiful godlike man.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.234
Bit faster, boys, bit faster.

18:56.535 --> 19:00.239
I'm starting to worry my crush
on Dan is getting out of control.

19:00.305 --> 19:03.942
The more I see him, the more I just
wanna tash his fucking face off.

19:04.009 --> 19:05.744
Close grip push ups for triceps.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.080
The girls realise
what great blokes we are.

19:08.146 --> 19:10.949
We're training on a beach
so Vicky can check out Dan

19:11.016 --> 19:12.184
and get a wide on.

19:21.026 --> 19:25.731
I don't know what he does to people.
He's got a raw sexual magnetism.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.933
Vicky could definitely pull him.

19:35.107 --> 19:38.544
Finish the training session
and Dan joined us for breakfast.

19:38.610 --> 19:41.446
I've never seen Vicky look so giddy
her whole life.

19:43.749 --> 19:47.886
All she's doing is this.
That means Vicky wants to fuck.

19:49.788 --> 19:52.324
I really want Dan to see us
out of me gym clothes

19:52.391 --> 19:55.093
cos let's face it,
who looks good in gym gear?

20:02.067 --> 20:04.937
Vicky is never gonna ask Dan on
a night out,

20:05.003 --> 20:07.639
but we've stepped in,
invited him on a night out,

20:07.706 --> 20:09.474
and the rest is up to her.

20:12.210 --> 20:16.081
Vicky, I thought you were confident,
you loved tashing on and all that,

20:16.148 --> 20:18.116
what's happened?

20:22.788 --> 20:25.424
Every time I look
you're staring at him.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.292
I can't...

20:27.359 --> 20:31.029
It's actually quite nice to get out
of the house and be with the lads

20:31.096 --> 20:33.265
cos they're enjoying being here.

20:33.332 --> 20:36.668
Have youse noticed Charlotte's mood?
Aye, she's a bit down.

20:36.735 --> 20:40.138
Whereas with the girls,
it's a totally different story.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.741
She's missing home,
she's missing Mitch.

20:42.808 --> 20:46.244
She's so homesick.
She deserves a bit of happiness.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.947
I think
Charlotte will last another week.

20:49.014 --> 20:52.584
Charlotte is still umming and ahing
about leaving.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.253
"I wanna go, I wanna stay."
Just make a decision.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.969
I think it's lush.
I might start having this every day.

21:11.036 --> 21:14.306
I've got something to tell the guys.
I hope they understand.

21:14.373 --> 21:17.309
I'm going away for a week.
I've flown Kate over

21:17.376 --> 21:20.746
and I've got
a fucking unbelievable beach resort.

21:20.812 --> 21:24.016
It's a good job that James
isn't bringing Kate to the house

21:24.082 --> 21:25.684
cos Holly fucking hates her.

21:25.751 --> 21:27.586
She hates the way she wears white

21:27.653 --> 21:30.255
and the way she called Holly
a fat slag and a whale.

21:30.322 --> 21:33.925
The way everything's going in here,
I didn't want to have dramas.

21:33.992 --> 21:38.530
Be nice to spend time.
Not just Holly I'm worried about.

21:38.597 --> 21:41.266
Charlotte hasn't been feeling
too great lately

21:41.333 --> 21:43.068
and I know if I bring Kate in

21:43.135 --> 21:46.338
she'll want to leave
and go home and see Mitch.

21:46.405 --> 21:50.008
Charlotte is so down, constantly
talking about wanting to leave

21:50.075 --> 21:51.643
and I understand that,

21:51.710 --> 21:55.180
but at the same time,
it's just so demoralising.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.949
All the best.
(all toast)

22:16.034 --> 22:19.604
Everyone knows about the big
competition between Gaz and Scott

22:19.671 --> 22:23.408
and basically now,
Scott is in the lead by so far

22:23.475 --> 22:26.178
and no-one would've thought
this would happen.

22:26.244 --> 22:28.346
Gary is getting beaten
at his own game.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.024
We're going to Trots.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.361
Trots is massive in Australia.

22:43.428 --> 22:46.364
We're in Sydney,
we might as well check it out.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.409
We're at Trots
and it's not as bad as the dogs

22:57.476 --> 22:59.044
but not as good as I imagined.

22:59.111 --> 23:02.848
To the wombs.
No talking about wombs.

23:02.914 --> 23:04.216
Why?

23:07.085 --> 23:11.690
Now we're talking about babies,
marriages, getting houses together.

23:17.429 --> 23:20.031
Fucking hell.
I hope he's thinking the same.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.679
Awful.
A little Sophie and Joel hybrid.

23:34.746 --> 23:35.881
Wrong.

23:35.947 --> 23:38.116
Babies shouldn't have babies.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.326
So whilst everyone
gets to go to the races,

23:48.393 --> 23:51.596
me and Scott have to go to work.
Mint(!)

23:54.332 --> 23:57.202
Are you Aussies
ready to go fucking wild or what?

23:57.269 --> 24:00.572
Seeing as I'm apparently
Scotty T's fucking best mate,

24:00.639 --> 24:02.440
I may as well try and help him pull.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.784
I'd much rather be on the party bus
than at Trots

24:12.851 --> 24:14.686
cos we're having a proper frisk.

24:14.753 --> 24:17.522
DJ Jamesy T and MC Scotty T.

24:17.589 --> 24:21.760
Get fucking smashed, get bucked
and fucking love it!

24:21.827 --> 24:24.496
I'm leaving Scotty T
to do what he does best,

24:24.563 --> 24:27.032
dance around like a tit
and try and pull.

24:28.333 --> 24:32.571
Everyone wants to neck on. It's all
right, though, I got loads of time.

24:34.105 --> 24:37.142
I'm not one to waste time
so I'm gonna get my bird sorted.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.477
I've told her
to bring her mates for Gary

24:39.544 --> 24:42.881
so he doesn't fall too far behind,
not that it's a competition.

24:46.251 --> 24:49.921
Tonight has just proved I can have
a good night with Scotty T

24:49.988 --> 24:51.289
when he's not with Gaz.

24:51.356 --> 24:54.226
I hope it doesn't change
as soon as we get to the club.

25:03.401 --> 25:04.836
Vicky is on fire.

25:04.903 --> 25:07.906
I'm sowing my wild oats.
Go on, Vicky.

25:07.973 --> 25:11.610
I can't believe it. Tonight has went
from fucking mint to shit.

25:12.744 --> 25:14.679
Why can't they go and have a wank?

25:16.248 --> 25:20.318
I can do it, but I guarantee we will
not be speaking by the time we leave.

25:21.119 --> 25:22.454
I wish I went with James.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.923
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

25:27.492 --> 25:27.692
.

25:30.228 --> 25:30.428
.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.105
So we've all had pre-drinks at Trots

25:40.171 --> 25:42.574
and we're prepped
and we are ready to go out.

25:47.345 --> 25:50.482
Seeing as I'm apparently
Scotty T's best mate now,

25:50.548 --> 25:54.119
I'm gonna help him out
and wingman the fuck out of this.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.892
Tonight I'm dressed like this

26:00.959 --> 26:04.896
cos I'm gonna meet Dan, the wicked
fucking instructor from the gym,

26:04.963 --> 26:06.331
and I'm not sorry.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.709
I'm necking on with a bird
and she's brought three friends

26:17.776 --> 26:19.811
but I cannot cope with the others.

26:22.514 --> 26:25.850
I'll keep these three happy
so Scott can pull her.

26:27.252 --> 26:30.989
This could be the first ever foursome
in the Geordie Shore house.

26:36.227 --> 26:38.897
Dan has given me
a full-on pie tonight,

26:38.964 --> 26:41.499
but there's not point
crying over spilt cock.

26:41.566 --> 26:46.404
I'll get out there and find another
wicked fit Australian bastard. YOLO!

26:48.873 --> 26:52.410
Dan who? I've already found
another wicked Australian lad.

26:55.714 --> 26:57.983
Vicky is absolutely on fire.

26:58.049 --> 26:59.851
Tonight she was meant to meet Dan

26:59.918 --> 27:02.387
but before he got here
she pulled someone else.

27:07.225 --> 27:10.795
Whether we like it or not,
me and Gaz are in competition.

27:17.936 --> 27:21.239
Now he's getting jealous cos
I've got three and he's got one.

27:21.306 --> 27:24.109
What is going through your head?

27:24.175 --> 27:28.279
Scott is such a dick.
This competition is going too far.

27:33.918 --> 27:35.253
Watching Gary and Scott

27:35.320 --> 27:38.523
is like watching two babies
fight over one dummy.

27:42.027 --> 27:46.064
What Scott doesn't understand, if
I don't take these three girls back,

27:46.131 --> 27:47.432
his girl won't come.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.903
Shock, the minute
Scott and Gaz are back together,

27:51.970 --> 27:53.671
they're arguing about birds.

27:59.044 --> 28:03.214
Me and Joel are rolling around
together, having a laugh, a drink,

28:03.281 --> 28:05.050
I'm dancing on him.

28:05.116 --> 28:09.020
Charlotte is watching Sophie and
Joel and I can almost read her mind.

28:09.087 --> 28:12.490
I know what she's thinking.
She wishes that was her and Mitch.

28:14.025 --> 28:17.695
It's all getting a bit too much
for me so I start to cry.

28:17.762 --> 28:19.998
Being away from him
must be killing her

28:20.065 --> 28:22.967
and I know I've got to get her
out of this situation.

28:24.135 --> 28:27.439
Right now I'm feeling so devastated.

28:27.505 --> 28:32.277
No amount of family dinners,
stupid nights out, activities

28:32.343 --> 28:34.679
are gonna make us forget
I miss him so much.

28:34.746 --> 28:39.217
I wish I was in James's place,
cos I don't want to be here.

28:39.284 --> 28:42.887
Me and Gaz are fucked off with
each other. I want to bounce out.

28:42.954 --> 28:47.025
After devoting my whole night to
wingmanning him, we leave the club.

28:47.092 --> 28:50.028
He's got one girl, I'm with
her friends, let's go home.

29:05.877 --> 29:09.681
We get back and I'm explaining that
he's got one girl, I've got three.

29:11.883 --> 29:16.521
For the first time ever, I can see
jealousy and that competitive look.

29:18.289 --> 29:20.492
He was devastated
that I had more girls.

29:29.167 --> 29:31.936
I'm not the type of person
to argue with when pissed.

29:32.003 --> 29:35.006
(both talk over each other)

29:35.073 --> 29:37.876
Oh, my God. I can't get a word in.

29:40.879 --> 29:44.482
Scott's smashing the house up again.
I don't understand.

29:46.050 --> 29:47.051
Stop it.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.255
When boys are angry, why can't
they just go and have a wank?

29:50.321 --> 29:51.589
Where's them girls?

29:52.790 --> 29:55.293
To top it off,
all the birds have fucked off.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.899
Get a drink of water and go to bed.
I'm not going to bed.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.000
I can't believe it.

30:02.066 --> 30:05.436
Tonight, Australia went
from fucking mint to shit.

30:05.503 --> 30:07.338
This house is an unhappy house.

30:07.405 --> 30:10.708
All that happens is drama,
fights and arguing.

30:10.775 --> 30:13.545
I can't even be bothered to be here.

30:13.611 --> 30:16.181
I didn't realise
someone could be that thick.

30:16.247 --> 30:17.715
No, he's really bad.

30:22.554 --> 30:26.324
I can't wait, cos me fucking
balls are like coconuts.

30:43.074 --> 30:46.211
Suddenly the blackboard
went flying off the wall. What?!

30:53.952 --> 30:56.487
Scott's apologising
cos he did fuck up.

30:56.554 --> 31:00.325
End of the day, our friendship
is more important than a competition.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.527
If he wants a competition,
we can do it,

31:02.594 --> 31:05.630
but we won't be speaking
by the time we leave Australia.

31:17.875 --> 31:20.612
I don't know whether to follow
me head or me heart.

31:20.678 --> 31:22.413
How are you supposed to know?

31:32.223 --> 31:35.627
Where are ya?
(Scott) We are here.

31:35.693 --> 31:39.163
Oi, everyone,
get your arses down here!

31:39.230 --> 31:42.800
(Charlotte)
Eh? We didn't do anything wrong.

31:42.867 --> 31:45.703
Sydney Steve turns up
and he is foaming with Scott.

31:45.770 --> 31:49.540
Scott has smashed up the house again
and Steve's not standing for it.

31:49.607 --> 31:52.944
Your behaviour is fucking disgusting.
Sorry, mate.

31:53.011 --> 31:54.178
No, there's no sorry.

31:54.245 --> 31:57.949
Scott has gone too far this time
and Steve is absolutely raging.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.724
Steve's given us wrong
for smashing up the house

32:06.791 --> 32:08.259
but I pure loved it.

32:08.326 --> 32:10.995
Catch youse later.
Cheers, Steve. Bye.

32:13.231 --> 32:15.366
As a treat,
we're going to the Outback.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.936
I don't see the fucking difference.
They sound like shite.

32:19.003 --> 32:20.805
We should just keep our hopes up.

32:24.008 --> 32:25.143
Don't miss us.

32:25.209 --> 32:29.147
(Charlotte) # We're all going on
An Outback holiday #

32:29.213 --> 32:31.149
(Vicky) Shut up!
Let's get smashed.

32:33.184 --> 32:36.821
I'm not going to the Outback because
I get to spend time with Joel,

32:36.888 --> 32:39.090
but then again, Scott's here

32:39.157 --> 32:42.126
and it'll just be like me and Joel
having to babysit him.

32:42.193 --> 32:43.494
I'm not bothered

32:43.561 --> 32:46.631
as long as they don't start
shagging each other up the arse.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.375
Scott's getting punished

32:57.442 --> 33:00.945
and it's the most pathetic punishment
I have ever heard in me life.

33:01.012 --> 33:06.250
Gary's with the girls as well.
Girls don't even like Gary.

33:07.185 --> 33:10.288
I'm really happy to be away
with Vicky, Gary and Holly.

33:10.355 --> 33:14.826
I'm just need a break from Scott
cos he's starting to piss us off.

33:14.892 --> 33:16.127
It's getting dark.

33:16.194 --> 33:20.264
Even better, this means
it's gonna be really scary. Yes!

33:22.066 --> 33:24.435
(screaming)

33:26.871 --> 33:30.808
We turn up in the middle of nowhere.
Where the fuck am I?

33:32.543 --> 33:37.415
I'm not kidding, this looks like
something off fucking Hostel.

33:37.482 --> 33:38.916
Gary, I can't see a thing!

33:38.983 --> 33:42.086
We get to the bush and it's dark,
it smells a bit funny,

33:42.153 --> 33:45.356
it's spooky and there's always
the fear of feral animals.

33:45.423 --> 33:49.160
So far, not so good.
No way, no way.

33:49.227 --> 33:53.097
Guys, welcome. I'm Sally.
Nice to meet you. Gaz.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.732
Gaz, pleased to meet you.

33:54.799 --> 33:57.535
I would have thought
staying over in the Outback

33:57.602 --> 34:00.371
would be one of my nightmares.

34:00.438 --> 34:04.342
Give it a go.
Sheep shearing, why the fuck not?

34:04.409 --> 34:07.412
Come on down.
I'll show you where you're staying.

34:07.478 --> 34:09.781
I need to give you a few warnings.

34:09.847 --> 34:13.784
I can hear sounds of these animals
and I'm thinking, "I'm gonna die."

34:13.851 --> 34:16.554
One toilet in here.

34:19.824 --> 34:23.127
You think you're safe,
you go to the toilet just for a shit

34:23.194 --> 34:25.362
and a frog can climb up
your bum hole.

34:25.429 --> 34:27.598
They're the least of your problems.

34:27.665 --> 34:30.868
You don't need to worry about frogs,
they're friendly.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.338
I've heard about these bears.

34:34.405 --> 34:37.708
They're like koala bears.
They like to drop out of trees.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.643
They drop on you to attack you.

34:39.710 --> 34:44.047
It's so dark, I can hardly
see me own hand in front of us.

34:44.114 --> 34:46.083
I bet there's a murderer here
as well.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.985
(they scream)

34:48.052 --> 34:51.422
I don't know what's worse,
these crazy noises,

34:51.489 --> 34:55.159
being stuck in the Outback
or being stuck with the girls.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.495
Come and see
your sleeping arrangements.

34:57.562 --> 35:00.765
Is that where we're staying?
There's two beds in here.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.800
I'm there.
We're all in there.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.502
Bagsy in there.

35:04.569 --> 35:06.938
There's no chance
I'm going in this one.

35:07.004 --> 35:08.539
I've drawn the short straw.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.375
I have to share the fucking tent
with Gaz.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.311
Chlamydia isn't airborne, is it?

35:14.245 --> 35:15.379
(girls scream)

35:15.446 --> 35:18.683
Vicky and Gary are in a tent.
Maybe it's third time lucky.

35:18.749 --> 35:22.186
All they need to know is
I am very aware of this.

35:27.925 --> 35:30.895
You do know you could ring
a girl if you wanted.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.297
Have you got anyone's numbers?
Aye.

35:33.364 --> 35:35.733
Go on then, you ring them. Crack on.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.337
Sophie and Joel bet me I can't get
a bird round within half an hour

35:39.403 --> 35:42.807
but I know if I make one phone call,
I'll have that boxed off.

35:43.708 --> 35:46.544
Basically, I've got
this bird's number.

35:46.611 --> 35:49.480
All I've got written under it
is "Scary Canary"

35:49.547 --> 35:52.116
and that's the name of the club.

35:52.183 --> 35:58.189
I've also got a random number and
someone's written, "I dare you".

35:58.256 --> 36:00.725
I'm so glad
I didn't have to go to the Outback.

36:00.791 --> 36:03.828
I can't imagine there's much talent
in the bush for Gaz

36:03.895 --> 36:06.130
and I'm in the shag pad
with a mint bird.

36:06.197 --> 36:08.466
Hello, is that Olivia?
"Hey."

36:08.533 --> 36:11.102
Hey, you all right?
"I'm good, how are you?"

36:11.168 --> 36:13.571
Aye, you're very chirpy
on the phone.

36:13.638 --> 36:18.309
We're having a few drinks, a BBQ,
and do you want to come round?

36:18.376 --> 36:22.380
"Sounds good to me."
All right, babe. See you soon. Bye.

36:22.446 --> 36:23.781
Wicked!

36:23.848 --> 36:26.050
What happened?
I is the man.

36:26.117 --> 36:28.719
Tonight better be the night.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.187
Gary could never do this

36:30.254 --> 36:34.125
and I can imagine when Gary gets back
he's gonna be so pissed off.

36:34.191 --> 36:36.327
How long will she be?
About 40 minutes.

36:36.394 --> 36:39.964
I'm gonna go wash me dick and that.
Oh!

36:40.031 --> 36:42.133
Nah, wash me face and that.

36:42.199 --> 36:43.367
Hi.

36:44.535 --> 36:45.903
Stage one complete.

36:45.970 --> 36:48.239
Oh, my God.

36:48.306 --> 36:51.909
I'm here
and I'm having such a good night.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.012
Second stage, shag pad.

36:55.079 --> 36:58.849
Every night in Australia
is topping the previous one.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.285
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

37:03.988 --> 37:04.188
.

37:06.757 --> 37:06.958
.

37:13.364 --> 37:14.966
(guitar music)

37:22.974 --> 37:26.277
We're sat here in the middle
of the Outback in Australia

37:26.344 --> 37:27.945
and it's just amazing.

37:29.814 --> 37:31.582
Despite it not being my cup of tea

37:31.649 --> 37:33.851
there's something
quite nice about it.

37:33.918 --> 37:38.322
I'm sitting with the girls,
having a laugh, there's no stress,

37:38.389 --> 37:41.125
and I'm actually bonding
with the girls.

37:41.192 --> 37:45.129
Vicky and Gary are flirting
and I don't know what to make of it.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.967
If Vicky got with Gary,
I'd be shocked

37:50.034 --> 37:52.803
because I expected more from her.

37:54.071 --> 37:57.808
(cheering, applause)

37:57.875 --> 38:01.245
Since the people who run the site
are being so accommodating

38:01.312 --> 38:04.649
and sharing their traditions,
it's only fair we share ours.

38:04.715 --> 38:07.785
One, two, three, go.
To Bill and Sal.

38:11.589 --> 38:15.126
Do you normally do it this way?
I usually have a beer and steak.

38:15.192 --> 38:16.961
(laughter)

38:17.028 --> 38:21.732
I think this has been amazing
and it's nice of youse to have wor,

38:21.799 --> 38:24.301
Bill and Sal, thank you.

38:24.368 --> 38:26.604
I've never met nicer people.
(all) Aw!

38:26.671 --> 38:29.140
That's what we feel
about you as well, Bill.

38:29.206 --> 38:32.276
This is what Australia should be,
isn't it?

38:32.343 --> 38:35.446
I wasn't looking forward
to coming to the Outback,

38:35.513 --> 38:38.749
but I'm here, I'm suitably pissed,
I've got good company,

38:38.816 --> 38:43.187
a beautiful view
and I'm having such a good night.

38:43.254 --> 38:46.957
We're gonna go to bed.
Got to get up early in the morning.

38:47.024 --> 38:51.629
Bill, we'll see you in the morning.
I'd love to see you in the morning.

38:51.696 --> 38:55.733
I don't know if it's the stars,
the campfire or Bill playing guitar,

38:55.800 --> 38:58.602
but we're all mortal
and we're getting loved up,

38:58.669 --> 39:01.772
roasting marshmallows
on the open fire.

39:01.839 --> 39:04.008
(screams)

39:10.681 --> 39:12.717
Hi.

39:12.783 --> 39:14.285
How are you?

39:14.351 --> 39:16.053
Hi, what's your name?
Olivia.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.623
I'm Sophie.
I'm Joel.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.694
This bird turns up looking lethal.
Well, worthy enough of the pipe.

39:23.761 --> 39:26.297
Just us cos
everyone else has gone camping.

39:26.363 --> 39:28.566
To be fair,
Scott has done it here, like.

39:28.632 --> 39:32.136
He's been able to pull a girl in half
an hour and get her to the house.

39:33.504 --> 39:36.006
(laughter)

39:42.346 --> 39:44.515
Scott and his bird are mortal.

39:47.518 --> 39:48.886
Gary could never do this

39:48.953 --> 39:52.690
and I can imagine when Gary gets back
he's gonna be so pissed off.

40:01.832 --> 40:04.735
Are you in the caravan with me?
Yeah.

40:04.802 --> 40:07.538
How did youse get the caravan?
Deluxe.

40:07.605 --> 40:10.541
Cheers, lasses.
Wicked, as per usual.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.977
You fucking set of knobs.

40:13.043 --> 40:15.479
I can't be angry.
He was never me boyfriend.

40:15.546 --> 40:17.181
We live under the same roof.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.917
It is too hard to hold a grudge,
but what the fuck?

40:21.485 --> 40:24.155
Fucking hell.
I'm shattered.

40:28.359 --> 40:31.162
In the past, I'd always share
a tent with Charlotte

40:31.228 --> 40:32.496
but now I'm with Vicky.

40:32.563 --> 40:36.167
The only good thing is I'll not
wake regretting banging her.

40:36.233 --> 40:39.003
The only thing I'm worried about
is Scott.

40:39.069 --> 40:41.505
I hold my hand on me heart
and say that.

40:41.572 --> 40:44.642
I thought I've been
in a bad position with the girls.

40:44.708 --> 40:46.610
Scott is fucked.

41:00.524 --> 41:03.561
My friendship is more important
than a competition.

41:03.627 --> 41:06.931
The whole Scott situation as well,

41:06.997 --> 41:11.101
I know he is getting on
everybody's tits.

41:11.168 --> 41:13.571
Scott needs to wake up
and smell the coffee

41:13.637 --> 41:15.973
if he thinks
he's king dick of this house.

41:16.040 --> 41:20.077
Idiot. What he says, goes.
It's all about him.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.012
Scott does annoy me quite a lot.

41:22.079 --> 41:26.016
Some of the things he does and says,
I just think, "For God's sake."

41:26.083 --> 41:27.184
But I do love him.

41:27.251 --> 41:29.220
I feel like that night...

41:29.286 --> 41:31.822
I'd said to people
I'll not have sex with him,

41:31.889 --> 41:34.258
but at the end of the day,
I was mortal.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.527
I said to him,
it could have been anyone.

41:36.594 --> 41:40.865
He's the only person in the house
who I can get attention off.

41:47.605 --> 41:49.940
Look at him.
How hot does she look?

41:50.007 --> 41:52.977
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

41:53.043 --> 41:55.379
Oh, my God.

41:55.446 --> 41:58.983
One last shot in the hot tub.
Let's have a...

41:59.049 --> 42:02.720
I actually feel like the third wheel.
I feel a bit embarrassed.

42:02.786 --> 42:05.890
We've been together two year
and we're not this loved up.

42:05.956 --> 42:08.125
You and your shots of fucking vodka.

42:08.192 --> 42:09.927
This is starting to feel weird.

42:09.994 --> 42:13.964
Watching Scotty T with this girl
is making us feel sick.

42:14.031 --> 42:17.067
I would much rather watch Charlotte
shave her bum hole

42:17.134 --> 42:18.802
than see them kissing again.

42:22.072 --> 42:25.309
I think the fact that me and Ricci
aren't together any more

42:25.376 --> 42:30.014
has allowed me and you
to finally be friends.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.716
I think everything is
coming together nicely

42:32.783 --> 42:36.654
and we are all starting to be
a proper family.

42:36.720 --> 42:40.457
In a relationship, I couldn't have
a friendship with the lads.

42:40.524 --> 42:44.228
Now I'm single,
it's a really liberating feeling.

42:44.295 --> 42:47.364
It was nice tonight, though.
Goodnight.

42:47.431 --> 42:48.966
Night, babe.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.404
I'm really starting to like Gaz
and I never thought I'd say it.

42:53.470 --> 42:56.607
I hope he doesn't think this will
lead to me sucking him off.

42:56.674 --> 42:59.009
The last few hours
have been eye-opening

42:59.076 --> 43:01.478
and deep and full of emotion.

43:01.545 --> 43:03.414
No socks on either?

43:03.480 --> 43:06.183
I've got socks on. They're Gary's.
(screams)

43:06.250 --> 43:10.020
And just really good
and they've made us want to stay.

43:10.087 --> 43:13.290
I think this may be the one night
we actually have to spoon.

43:13.357 --> 43:16.427
You're stealing the quilts already.
Oh, God.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.169
Scott wants the shag pad
for him and his girl.

43:25.235 --> 43:27.571
Scott wins,
but I'm not even that bothered

43:27.638 --> 43:30.507
because that whole shag pad
is full of Joel's cum.

43:30.574 --> 43:33.344
Sophie and Joel have been
mint craic tonight

43:33.410 --> 43:34.812
but now this bird's here,

43:34.878 --> 43:38.148
time for pipe-a-tron
to do what he does best.

43:47.324 --> 43:50.127
At least I'm not stuck
in the Outback overnight.

43:50.194 --> 43:54.431
Oh, yeah! Harder, harder, harder!
(laughs)

43:56.200 --> 44:00.304
Joel always seems to find
the best in everyone, even Scotty T.

44:00.371 --> 44:03.307
Scott's been going on like
an absolute twat lately,

44:03.374 --> 44:05.943
but Joel seems to think
that he's gonna change.

44:06.010 --> 44:08.045
But I think Scotty will never change.

44:16.186 --> 44:17.721
Last night I had an epiphany.

44:18.989 --> 44:22.493
It's a nude beach. Shrivelled cocks
and saggy tits everywhere

44:22.559 --> 44:24.928
and that's just Joel and Sophie.

44:24.995 --> 44:28.599
Operation cock block.
He's got an STI. Whoops!

44:28.665 --> 44:30.667
(laughs)

44:32.036 --> 44:34.304
This is Operation Too Much Fanny.

44:37.174 --> 44:39.777
Fucking buzzing!
I've fucking done it!

44:39.843 --> 44:43.013
I've tashed on with fit Dan!

44:43.080 --> 44:44.882
Suck us off!

44:44.948 --> 44:46.250
I don't know what to do

44:46.316 --> 44:48.819
cos I'm scared of his cock,
it's not familiar.
