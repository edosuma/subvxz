DENNIS: All right, well,
that about does it,

00:05.396 --> 00:07.181
which means we are officially

00:07.224 --> 00:09.357
-on island time.
-Oh, yeah.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.402
-Yeah, baby. [whoops]
-Here we go.

00:11.446 --> 00:12.838
-Island time.
-Ah, Frank.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.231
I'm so excited about
this concert.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.363
-Thank you for the tickets.
-Yeah.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.060
-Oh, I love Jimmy Buffett.
-Oh, yeah.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.106
And those Parrothead broads,
they're wild.

00:19.149 --> 00:20.846
-I noticed that. They're nuts.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.240
-They are wild.
-I hope he plays
"The Piña Colada Song," man.

00:23.284 --> 00:25.112
-Oh, yeah, that's the best.
-I gotta hear it.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.288
Yeah, I wish he would, too,
but he won't,

00:27.331 --> 00:28.811
'cause that's, uh,
that's not Buffett.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.247
-Huh?
-Yeah, no. H-He does.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.249
It's, uh, the one that goes...

00:32.293 --> 00:34.730
-♪ If you like piña coladas♪
-♪ Coladas♪

00:34.773 --> 00:37.820
-[vocalizing]
-♪ Getting caught in the rain.♪

00:37.863 --> 00:39.256
Yeah, no, I know the song,
I know the song,

00:39.300 --> 00:41.650
but it's sung by a man named
Rupert Holmes.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.347
-Who?
-Are you sure?
I feel like that's Buffett.

00:43.391 --> 00:44.609
We've been going to see Buffett
for 20 years.

00:44.653 --> 00:46.046
Have you ever heard him
play it?

00:46.089 --> 00:47.090
No, but he's not gonna play all

00:47.134 --> 00:48.657
of his hits every single time.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.093
Yeah, no, he is.
That's what he does.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.573
That's actually
the only thing he does.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.879
And that's just not one of them.
But, hey, listen, buddy,

00:53.923 --> 00:55.142
you want to hear that song,
you go ahead

00:55.185 --> 00:57.448
and request away.
I won't stop you.

-Yeah, yeah, yeah. We all do.
-Yeah, he won't, he won't.

01:06.979 --> 01:09.373
-W-Were you in the women's room?
-Mm-hmm.

01:09.417 --> 01:11.941
-Well, don't do that.
Don't use my bathroom.
-Why not?

01:11.984 --> 01:13.899
'Cause it's my bathroom,
and you're a man.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.597
Oh, no. Well, now, as a gay man,

01:15.640 --> 01:17.468
I just feel more comfortable
in the ladies' room.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.209
Oh, come on, the--
with the gay thing again.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.037
Like, look, it makes me
uncomfortable

01:21.081 --> 01:22.908
that you're in there using
my bathroom. How about that?

01:22.952 --> 01:24.345
Look, the whole men's
and women's

01:24.388 --> 01:26.129
bathroom thing is antiquated.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.913
-Maybe you're antiquated.
-Maybe I'm...

L-Listen--

01:32.135 --> 01:33.180
I know, I know, listen.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.399
We always do this.
We...

01:35.443 --> 01:37.575
We always get in some major tiff
right before Buffett,

01:37.619 --> 01:39.708
and then, you know, it just,
it just ruins

01:39.751 --> 01:41.753
-the whole island vibe,
you know?
-Yeah.

01:41.797 --> 01:44.191
Come on. We're not doing that
this time.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.757
All right?
This whole bathroom issue

01:45.801 --> 01:47.977
is a simple problem with
a simple solution.

01:48.020 --> 01:51.502
So why don't we just sit here
and let's just figure it out.

DENNIS:
All right, now we're talking.

02:17.354 --> 02:19.400
I tell ya, there's never been
a problem so big,

02:19.443 --> 02:20.705
couldn't be solved
by a late night

02:20.749 --> 02:22.098
and a little Chinese takeout.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.708
We should've got cheeseburgers.

-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's gonna do it.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.290
Now, guys, I believe that,
as a gay man,

02:40.334 --> 02:41.900
I should be able to use
the women's bathroom

02:41.944 --> 02:44.164
because I feel more comfortable
around women.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.949
-Okay, why?
-Well, "A," we both like dudes,

02:46.992 --> 02:49.343
and "B," we both find
women's bodies disgusting,

02:49.386 --> 02:51.475
-so there's no hanky-panky.
-Well, that tracks.

02:51.519 --> 02:52.607
-Yeah, sure, that makes sense.
-DEE: Yeah, yeah.

02:52.650 --> 02:53.999
Done! I'm using
the ladies' bathroom, right?

02:54.043 --> 02:55.566
N-n-n-n-n-n-- My turn.

-My turn, right?
-Oh, do you have to...?

02:57.481 --> 02:58.569
-The floor is yours.
-I thought Mac just solved it.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.441
-No. No, no.
-No.
-All right.

03:00.484 --> 03:04.227
Okay, "A," not all women
like dudes-- lesbians,

03:04.271 --> 03:07.448
for example-- and, "B,"
I find you disgusting.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.450
I don't want men pooping
next to me.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.278
-Would you let a trans woman
go in there?
-Of course I would.

03:11.321 --> 03:12.714
-But not me?
-No, not you,
because you're a man.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.498
You're a gay man,
but you're still a man.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.283
I don't know why you're being
such a bitch

03:16.326 --> 03:18.328
about this, Dee. I've been
pooping next to you for months.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.591
-What are you talking about?
-You've been in the stall
next to me.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.072
I-I recognize you
from those pink heels you have.

03:23.115 --> 03:25.248
-I don't own pink heels.
-Yes, you do.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.598
The ones with the straps
that-that make those giant feet

03:27.642 --> 03:29.296
look so dainty and cute.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.036
Mac, I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.473
CHARLIE:
Mm, uh...

03:32.516 --> 03:35.650
Okay, um... [chuckles]

03:35.693 --> 03:40.524
All right, uh, I think I can
actually explain this...

03:42.396 --> 03:45.442
Uh, Charlie, I do hope that
the explaining you're gonna do

03:45.486 --> 03:48.793
is about why this bathroom
is so much cleaner than ours.

03:48.837 --> 03:49.968
Don't worry about it,
this is the last time

03:50.012 --> 03:51.056
you're gonna be in here.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.536
Charlie, what is taking so long?

03:52.580 --> 03:53.363
CHARLIE: Give me a minute.
Give me a minute!

03:53.407 --> 03:54.756
Uh...

03:54.799 --> 03:56.279
Oh, there they are!

03:56.323 --> 03:57.585
Those are the pink heels
I was talking about.

03:57.628 --> 03:58.934
Charlie, are you
a cross-dresser?

03:58.977 --> 04:01.023
CHARLIE: No! I just like to use
the women's bathroom,

04:01.066 --> 04:03.460
because it's, you know,
it's quieter, it's less crowded.

04:03.504 --> 04:04.896
And very clean.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.463
CHARLIE:
Yeah, and, look, I-I just,

04:06.507 --> 04:07.290
whatever, I slip on the heels,

04:07.334 --> 04:09.031
in case someone looked under
the stall.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.511
I didn't want anyone
to be uncomfortable.

04:10.554 --> 04:13.383
-That's it.
-Okay. But what's with the wig?

04:13.427 --> 04:15.864
CHARLIE:
[stammering] Come on!

04:15.907 --> 04:17.387
Don't make me do
the whole thing.

04:17.431 --> 04:20.390
The wig is just in case
someone peeks over the top.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.565
How about the dress, bud?

04:21.609 --> 04:23.915
-CHARLIE: Goddamn it. It...
-[stall door opens]

04:23.959 --> 04:26.396
-Oh!
-Whoa. Whoa. [laughs]

04:26.440 --> 04:28.355
Okay, okay.
Look, the dress just ties

04:28.398 --> 04:29.530
the whole look together,
so, you know...

04:29.573 --> 04:31.227
You are a cross-dresser.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.663
No, I'm not.
Look, I was raised

04:32.707 --> 04:34.317
by a single mother, you know?

04:34.361 --> 04:36.493
And we were always on the go,
and sometimes

04:36.537 --> 04:39.235
we'd be at, like, a museum
or, you know, a stadium,

04:39.279 --> 04:41.498
and I'd have to go to
the bathroom, and my mom wasn't

04:41.542 --> 04:43.413
gonna put me in
the men's room by myself,

04:43.457 --> 04:45.241
so she carried around a dress
with her.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.548
She would slip it on,
and I would go in and out

04:47.591 --> 04:49.419
of the women's bathroom
and no one would notice.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.116
And then, you know,
as the years went by,

04:51.160 --> 04:52.944
I just got more comfortable
pooping

04:52.988 --> 04:55.599
with a dress, so, whatever,
it's not that weird.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.645
-Hold on, though,
it's very, very weird.
-It is so weird.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.560
Look, lots of people do it.
It's...

04:59.603 --> 05:00.648
-I doubt it.
-I don't know anybody
who does it.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.519
-Uh, no.
-Not one person on the planet.

05:02.563 --> 05:03.738
It is what it is, I mean,

05:03.781 --> 05:05.435
it's the only way
I can poop, so...

05:05.479 --> 05:07.263
-O-kay.
-I guess it is what it is.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.656
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
-It is what it is,
and it is very strange,

05:08.699 --> 05:09.961
but it does bring up
an interesting point.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.441
You see, Dee, you did mention
moments ago

05:11.485 --> 05:13.095
that you would be
comfortable having

05:13.138 --> 05:14.662
a transgender woman
use your bathroom.

05:14.705 --> 05:15.706
Of course I would, so what?

05:15.750 --> 05:17.447
-Well...
-No. That's not,

05:17.491 --> 05:19.580
that's not the same thing,
he's not transgender.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.364
Well, no. He's-he's not
transgender,

05:21.408 --> 05:24.062
but he identifies as a woman
when he poops.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.413
No. No. Goddamn it,
you're only saying that

05:26.456 --> 05:27.588
'cause my bathroom's nicer.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.459
No, no. I-I think,
I think Mac is right.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.505
I think this system is
antiquated, and I think--

05:31.548 --> 05:33.202
-Is that, is that a hand dryer?
-Oh, damn.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.812
-Yeah, there's a hand dryer
in here.
-Oh, goddamn it.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.423
-[overlapping conversation]
-Well, let's vote.
All those in favor.

05:36.466 --> 05:39.382
-MAC/DENNIS/CHARLIE/FRANK: Aye.
-No. Goddamn it.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.297
Nice. Okay, well, I knew
we could solve it, guys.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.082
-This is great.
-And then should we also change
the signs on the doors

05:44.126 --> 05:45.780
to reflect that
it's not a boys' room

05:45.823 --> 05:47.651
-and a girls' room anymore?
-DENNIS: Right. Yeah, no.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.000
We'll pop some new signs
on there real fast.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.959
You know, so it's clear that any
gender can use any bathroom.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.309
-Yeah, yeah.
-How hard could that be?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.572
-The dress is making me have to
poop really bad, so I'm gonna...
-Okay, let's do it.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.357
-Oh, goddamn it.
-Gotta poop, gotta poop.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.538
W-Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So, I'm sorry,

06:04.581 --> 06:06.496
what's wrong
with this one again?

06:06.540 --> 06:08.324
Well, I think it's confusing,
is what the problem is.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.978
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-Like, maybe we need words
or something.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.240
Well, also, like, what's with
the floating starfish

06:11.283 --> 06:12.589
trying to eat the rock?

06:12.633 --> 06:13.808
-That's a baby.
-That's a baby?

06:13.851 --> 06:15.766
-Yes, that's a...
-MAC: That's a baby?

06:15.810 --> 06:17.899
So, now what's happening, you
got wheelchair guy's back there

06:17.942 --> 06:20.467
throwing babies around trying
to get them in wheelchairs?

06:20.510 --> 06:21.685
-DEE: It's confusing.
-Okay, all right.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.687
So what if I cover up the baby,
how about now?

06:23.731 --> 06:25.167
I don't get it. Now it looks
like you either got to be

06:25.210 --> 06:27.909
in a wheelchair or a he-she
to go poop in there.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.824
-No, no, no, no, Frank,
come on, don't say "he-she."
-What?

06:29.867 --> 06:31.042
-It's hermaphrodite.
-MAC: Oh, nope.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.393
Dee, you can't say that anymore,
either.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.612
-It's intersex.
-Well, this is all confusing.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.135
Why do I have to keep learning
new things?

06:37.179 --> 06:38.615
How about this?

06:38.659 --> 06:40.617
We'll call the bathrooms
gender neutral.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.402
That makes me uncomfortable,
because I'm not neutral

06:42.445 --> 06:44.186
-about my gender.
-Mm.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.883
-So now you're uncomfortable,
okay.
-DEE: Okay.

06:45.927 --> 06:49.670
We put one sign on each door,
both of them say "gender fluid."

06:49.713 --> 06:52.063
Right. 'Cause that-that implies,
like, you're this,

06:52.107 --> 06:54.675
-you're that.
-I don't know. I don't like
thinking about gender fluids.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.851
Like, just, uh,
it's a gross image to me.

06:56.894 --> 06:57.982
-All right. Well...
-MAC: You know what? Look, look.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.723
It's just all so confusing.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.595
You know, we got to make this
much simpler.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.814
I have an idea, if I could just
go do one that I think will

07:03.858 --> 07:06.643
-clear it all up.
-Great. Go for it, buddy.
Hop to it.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.210
-[overlapping chatter]
-All right, do it, yeah.

07:08.253 --> 07:09.472
-Quick.
-Is the Internet working?

07:09.516 --> 07:10.734
-Hmm...
-DEE: Well, hang on. Hey.

07:10.778 --> 07:11.996
Yes, but you stay off it.
You stay...

07:12.040 --> 07:13.520
-No. No.
-No, no. I'm just...

07:13.563 --> 07:14.651
You crashed
our last three laptops, man.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.218
-You are not doing it again.
-Bring it out here.

07:16.261 --> 07:17.741
Do it out here where
we can see what you're doing.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.003
-No, I'll do it in the office.
-Do it in front of us.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.744
It'll take me, like,
two minutes. Two minutes.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.137
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-You go fast.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.921
MAC:
I'm-I'm finished.

07:23.965 --> 07:26.010
-I'm finally finished.
-Oh, God. It's about time.
-Goddamn it.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.708
-He's limping.
-Are you chafed?

07:27.751 --> 07:29.666
-He's chafed.
-Huh? Oh, yeah. Super chafed.
Hey, do you know

07:29.710 --> 07:31.842
how to get Russian malware
out of a computer?

07:31.886 --> 07:33.757
-No.
-Then the computer's broken.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.237
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Aw!

07:35.280 --> 07:36.760
-Yeah, but the sign's done.
-All right, man.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.022
Let's see what you got.

07:38.066 --> 07:40.590
-What do you think?
-[Charlie sighs]

07:40.634 --> 07:42.331
Well, I don't know
what I'm looking at.

07:42.374 --> 07:43.724
DENNIS: Yeah.
What-what am I seeing here?

07:43.767 --> 07:45.334
It's just dicks.

07:45.377 --> 07:46.466
-No. There's... I mean, yes.
-CHARLIE: Oh.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.684
There are a couple of dicks,
but...

07:47.728 --> 07:48.903
-It's mostly dicks.
-That's a lot of dicks.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.252
-Oh, now...
now all I see is dicks.
-Mm-hmm.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.558
No, there's also pictures

07:51.601 --> 07:53.560
of road kill
and roast beef sandwiches

07:53.603 --> 07:56.214
to accurately depict
what a vagina looks like.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.654
-CHARLIE: Okay.
-DENNIS: Anyone else
uncomfortable?

08:00.697 --> 08:03.526
All right. Moving on.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.659
All right. I'm just gonna go
back to the office.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.138
-No, you stay here.
-No. No, no, no. No!

08:07.182 --> 08:08.357
You are not going back to the...

08:10.577 --> 08:12.709
-Yeah.
-All right, all right.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.711
So, this... I think
this covers it all, right?

08:14.755 --> 08:16.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think. Yeah. There's the man.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.584
-Uh-huh.
-The woman.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.063
-Mm-hmm.
-That's the he-shes,

08:19.107 --> 08:20.804
or the interspecies,
whatever it is.

08:20.848 --> 08:22.110
Yeah, whatever you said.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.459
FRANK:
And this is Christians,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.635
-Muslims.
-DEE: I assume

08:25.679 --> 08:27.942
the dollar sign is meant
to represent Jews?

08:27.985 --> 08:29.552
Well, it ain't the Mormons.

08:29.596 --> 08:30.771
-Uh...
-Let's not get into that.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.337
-[groans]
-Okay, you know what?

08:32.381 --> 08:33.774
-Why-why are we bringing...?
-I was against it. Yeah.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.776
Why are we bringing religion
into this at all?

08:35.819 --> 08:37.604
Because I want to know
who's in there,

08:37.647 --> 08:39.344
-because
it'll make me feel safer.
-DEE: Oh, goddamn.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.085
Can we please put two signs
on the doors?

08:41.129 --> 08:43.566
-Both signs say "toilet."
-Yeah...

08:43.610 --> 08:45.612
-Oh.
-DEE: There's a toilet in there,

08:45.655 --> 08:47.527
and that's all you really need
to know.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.093
-You make a good point.
I think that would work.
-Could say "toilet,"

08:49.137 --> 08:50.530
-and then it's kind of
your choice which one you use.
-Just "toilet."

08:50.573 --> 08:51.835
That actually does work.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.924
-I feel like that totally works.
-Yeah.
-We solved it?

08:53.968 --> 08:55.752
-Okay, great. We so...
-Did we do it?
-We solved it!

08:55.796 --> 08:57.101
-DENNIS: We solved it!
-DEE: Oh, my God!

08:57.145 --> 08:58.712
-Let's get the hell out of here.
-All right.

08:58.755 --> 08:59.930
I feel like it was my idea,
but, yeah.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.541
Oh, you son of a bitch.
Just go.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.933
-I think I said it first.
-Just go.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.761
You guys, you go,
and I'll-I'll lock up, okay?

09:04.805 --> 09:06.763
I've had Chinese food.
It wants out, so...

09:06.807 --> 09:08.765
-Yeah.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.637
Why aren't you using
the good bathroom?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.160
Well, 'cause I'm about
to do some real damage.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.118
I don't... I don't want to do it
in the good bathroom.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.642
Well, I'm-I'm uncomfortable
with that.

09:15.685 --> 09:16.860
-DEE: How?
-So close.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.601
-[Mac sighs]
-We were so close.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.342
Well, because I just don't want
to share my bathroom

09:20.385 --> 09:22.562
-with a bunch of broads.
-DENNIS: What happened, Frank?

09:22.605 --> 09:24.868
-We decided
we were all cool with it.
-We were fine.

09:24.912 --> 09:27.741
I didn't know
she was gonna smash in there.

09:27.784 --> 09:31.135
A woman is not a lady
when she's dumping up a john.

09:31.179 --> 09:32.789
Also, this brings up
an interesting point.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.748
We should probably
confine Dee's damage

09:34.791 --> 09:36.619
to, like, one bathroom
or the other, you know?

09:36.663 --> 09:37.620
Otherwise,
I'm gonna have to clean both.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.187
Charlie, you're the janitor.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.884
You should be cleaning
both bathrooms regardless.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.973
-He hasn't been.
-Clean both bathrooms!
-I do it.

09:43.017 --> 09:44.671
Yeah, all right.
Well, now you're just, like,

09:44.714 --> 09:45.976
kind of getting off-topic here,
you know?

09:46.020 --> 09:48.675
I have an idea.
The guys should be able

09:48.718 --> 09:50.851
to pick
whichever bathroom they want.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.809
-Dee has to stay in hers.
-What?!

09:52.853 --> 09:54.594
-All in favor.
-Hey, that's majority rules.

09:54.637 --> 09:55.725
-Get out of here.
-Yeah, yeah.

09:55.769 --> 09:56.944
-DENNIS: There you go.
Solves it.
-No. No, no, no.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.902
Absolutely not.
No. You guys can't take away

09:58.946 --> 10:00.338
my right to choose.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.384
-Oh, you want to go there?
-I do want to go there.

10:02.427 --> 10:04.778
My body, my choice.
It says so in the Constitution.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.780
-Okay, well, the Bible says...
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.216
No, no, no, no, no, no. Guys,
don't do this. No, come on.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.914
It's crazy. All right.
Don't make this about abortion.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.264
Guys, we always do this.
We veer wildly off-topic,

10:13.308 --> 10:15.266
and the next thing you know,
we're having some ridiculous

10:15.310 --> 10:17.268
argument that has nothing to do
with what we're trying

10:17.312 --> 10:19.270
-to solve, you know.
-And then tempers flare.

10:19.314 --> 10:21.664
Exactly. We're talking about
evolution all of a sudden.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.362
Then we're arguing about racism
or whether or not ghouls exist.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.234
-They do, though,
'cause I've seen one.
-No, they don't.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.322
-No, they do.
-You-you've never seen them.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.802
-Yes, I have seen them.
-No, you haven't.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.281
-Yes, I have!
-Oh!
-DENNIS: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:30.325 --> 10:31.761
-No, wait! Hey, stop! Hey, stop!
-Charlie!

10:31.805 --> 10:34.938
-You stupid twink!
-I'm a bear! I'm a bear!

10:34.982 --> 10:36.244
-You wish you were a bear!
-DENNIS: Take it easy! Hey!

10:36.287 --> 10:37.811
Get-- Stop! We're off-topic.
This is not Buffett.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.900
This is not... We're not being
very Buffett right now.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.510
-That was not Buffett at all.
-We're not being very Buffett.

10:41.553 --> 10:42.729
-It wasn't very Buffett of me.
-MAC: It's not Buffett, man.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.166
All right, all right.
Oh! I got an idea.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.950
It should just be about what's
going on in there, right?

10:46.994 --> 10:48.691
What if we have

10:48.735 --> 10:52.608
separate bathrooms...
for separate bodily functions?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.436
Oh, like a piss room
and a shit room.

10:54.479 --> 10:57.047
Yeah. Exactly, okay?
And, uh, we just

10:57.091 --> 10:59.310
put very simple labels
on the door.

10:59.354 --> 11:02.531
Room number one for when
you got to empty your balls,

11:02.574 --> 11:06.448
and room number two for when
you got to empty your butt.

11:06.491 --> 11:09.233
Pee is not in your balls,
but... yeah. Okay.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.800
No. I don't think
it's gonna work because

11:10.844 --> 11:13.194
nobody can shit when everybody
knows you're shitting.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.978
-Why not? Everybody shits.
-FRANK: Yeah.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.546
Yeah, but it's a shameful act
that we all do in secret.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.809
-That's true.
-Even dogs know that.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.550
You ever see their eyes
when they're doing it?

11:21.593 --> 11:22.986
-They know.
-Mm.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.553
CHARLIE:
They look at you like this.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.990
-FRANK: Yeah.
-DENNIS: Yeah. They're ashamed.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.775
Yeah, well, guys, it's a system
that invites abuse.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.559
I mean, who here would use
the piss room to shit?

11:30.602 --> 11:33.040
No, that's the whole point,
is that you just pee in it.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.171
-I wouldn't do that.
-You use the shit room to shit.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.303
Yeah. No one's gonna do that.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.870
-FRANK: Pee over there.
-Really?

11:36.913 --> 11:38.436
Yeah. I'd-I'd poop
in the pee room.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.611
I would poop immediately
in the pee room.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.135
100% of the time
I will shit in the piss room.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.136
-You're totally right.
-Actually, don't like this idea.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.790
See? There you go.
I rest my case.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.487
Yeah. But you know what?
Maybe people would be

11:45.530 --> 11:47.489
a little less inclined to cheat,
and they wouldn't feel ashamed,

11:47.532 --> 11:49.143
if they had
a little bit more privacy.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.535
Like, what if the partitions

11:50.579 --> 11:51.798
went all the way down
to the ground?

11:51.841 --> 11:53.364
-Hmm.
-Yeah?

11:53.408 --> 11:55.323
And you created sort of a dome
of privacy.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.020
-So you're closed in.
-DENNIS: You're closed in.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.369
You know what you could do?
You could add

11:58.413 --> 12:00.328
a scented candle in there
for the smells.

12:00.371 --> 12:03.070
-DENNIS: Right.
-MAC: And some noise
to cover the sounds.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.899
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes.
-Loud noise, like screaming.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.944
-Mm-hmm.
-Or just music.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.816
Let's do music. Guys, we're
making progress. This is great.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.818
I'll tell you what. Uh, Dee, why
don't you go grab some cardboard

12:11.861 --> 12:13.558
-for the partitions.
-Yep, yep.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.952
And, um, I'll order us
some breakfast burritos.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.780
-It's getting to that time.
-'Cause I'm getting hungry.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.782
-Yeah!
-Tasty.
-Extra bacon for you?

12:19.826 --> 12:21.479
-Okay, okay. Yeah.
-Extra bacon, baby.
-All right.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.438
[people screaming]

12:30.314 --> 12:32.142
The screaming's
kind of cool, right?

12:32.186 --> 12:33.796
It's better. It's better.
Works better than the music.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.624
-I never would've thought.
-Yeah, yeah.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.539
The music, it was like, I felt
like I could hear maybe

12:37.582 --> 12:39.715
-a poop or a pee happening,
but the screams are...
-Right.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.412
And I honestly, I feel like
I'm not even in a bathroom

12:41.456 --> 12:43.501
-right now.
-Yeah. Here you are
eating a burrito.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.026
-Yeah. Yeah.
-In a bathroom. [laughs]
-[toilets flushing]

12:46.069 --> 12:48.506
-Oh! That was great.
-Yeah, how'd that go? Yeah?

12:48.550 --> 12:50.857
I did something in there. I'm
not gonna tell you what, though.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.684
Well, there's no need.
I couldn't hear a thing,

12:52.728 --> 12:54.121
-and I can't smell
a thing, so...
-Yeah. Yeah.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.905
Hey, Frank,
how's it going in there, man?

12:55.949 --> 12:58.125
FRANK: The walls are too high.
I don't know where to aim.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.431
-Aim? Aim-aim at the bowl.
The toilet.
-You just aim at the toilet.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.477
-The same spot.
-What are you talking about?

13:02.520 --> 13:05.393
-Ah!
-Whoa! Hey!
-Oh! Goddamn it.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.177
Never sneak up
on a man like that,

13:07.221 --> 13:09.658
especially when he's at
his most vulnerable.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.138
Why do you have a gun
on the toilet?

13:11.181 --> 13:12.661
I always carry a gun
on the toilet.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.010
Otherwise, I can't make.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.446
Well, now I'm
very uncomfortable.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.796
Well, tough titties.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.188
I got the right
to defend myself.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.842
It's in the Constitution.

13:19.886 --> 13:20.843
Have you ever read
the Constitution?

13:20.887 --> 13:22.889
Yes.

13:24.238 --> 13:26.675
No.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.938
This is wild stuff.

13:28.982 --> 13:33.247
There's a part in here that says
that freed slaves

13:33.290 --> 13:36.032
are only three-fifths
of a person.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.904
-It's wild. Yeah.
-Really? It says that in there?

13:37.947 --> 13:39.383
I can't imagine where
you're going with this, Frank.

13:39.427 --> 13:40.950
Well, I was figuring
that if we handled

13:40.994 --> 13:43.474
this problem like the
Constitution, that would mean

13:43.518 --> 13:47.087
that white landowners
would get a full bathroom.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.089
Everybody else gets
three-fifths.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.612
How do you use three-fifths
of a bathroom?

13:50.655 --> 13:51.656
Piss in the sink.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.051
I beg you to stop
using the Constitution

13:55.095 --> 13:56.400
in the way that you're using it.

13:56.444 --> 13:58.446
Listen. Frank just gave me
a good idea.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.622
-Hmm.
-Okay.
-Reparations.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.276
Look, minorities
have been treated

14:02.319 --> 14:04.408
like shit in this country
for so long, right?

14:04.452 --> 14:07.150
So, I say we give them
the good bathroom.

14:07.194 --> 14:10.284
You know? I mean, for years and
years, they've been oppressed.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.068
The least we can give them is,
you know,

14:12.112 --> 14:14.157
a nice place to piss
and shit, right?

14:14.201 --> 14:16.507
And we got to put up a sign
so that they know their place.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.292
Now, are-are you proposing
that we put a sign

14:18.335 --> 14:20.947
on one of the bathrooms
that says "minorities only"?

14:20.990 --> 14:22.296
What does the other sign say?

14:22.339 --> 14:24.080
-"No minorities allowed."
-DENNIS: That's crazy.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.516
-Do you hear yourself?
-CHARLIE: That's bad.
-DEE: You hear where

14:25.560 --> 14:26.517
you're running
into trouble there, right?

14:26.561 --> 14:27.649
No, no, it's super progressive.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.085
-No...
-Yeah, i-it's a bathroom

14:29.129 --> 14:32.306
-for women, non-whites,
and gays.
-Uh...

14:32.349 --> 14:34.090
Oh, oh!

14:34.134 --> 14:35.222
Oh, I get it.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.963
And I-I'm 100% on board.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.225
I agree. I'm with you.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.443
Wait a second, Dee.
So now you're okay

14:39.487 --> 14:40.836
with Mac using your bathroom?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.142
Yeah. As long as the majority
of the people

14:42.185 --> 14:44.144
aren't taking a shit
in my bathroom, sure.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.929
Okay, well, let's just go ahead
and vote for it. Ch-Charlie?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.104
W-Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second there.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.237
Before you vote, uh, Charlie,
uh, you know,

14:50.280 --> 14:52.195
consider this--
there's-there's no shame

14:52.239 --> 14:54.197
in doing what's best
for the majority.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.460
I mean, that is
what a democracy is, right?

14:56.504 --> 14:58.462
It's trying to please
the greatest number

14:58.506 --> 14:59.637
of people in a country.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.248
-White people.
-Please don't help.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.945
Okay? Yeah.
Uh, what I'm saying is

15:02.989 --> 15:04.947
that you're never gonna be able
to please everybody.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.296
It's just-- There's no way,
you know what I mean?

15:06.340 --> 15:07.819
And, of course, everybody wants
their own little piece

15:07.863 --> 15:09.430
of paradise, right?
I like mine with--

15:09.473 --> 15:11.606
I like mine
with lettuce and tomato.

15:11.649 --> 15:14.304
♪ Heinz 57
and French fried potatoes.♪

15:14.348 --> 15:15.653
-Mm.
-But that's just me, you know?

15:15.697 --> 15:17.612
There's a small minority
of people out there,

15:17.655 --> 15:19.440
they like their cheeseburgers
with pineapple.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.746
-Oh, yeah, I know.
Get the hell out of here.
-Ew.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.879
-Gross.
-What are you thinking?
You know what I mean?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.272
But there is a minority
out there, and that's how

15:25.315 --> 15:27.274
they like it. But are we saying
that, for those people's sake,

15:27.317 --> 15:29.145
we got to have
every single hamburger store

15:29.189 --> 15:31.147
in the whole country
offer pineapples

15:31.191 --> 15:33.802
-on their cheeseburgers?
I don't think that's right.
-We'll run out of pineapples.

15:33.845 --> 15:36.065
Mm-mm. We ought
to take it off the pizza, too.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.501
Hawaiians are savages.

15:37.545 --> 15:38.938
Okay, you're not helping,
all right?

15:38.981 --> 15:41.505
Your racism is making--
I hate when you're on my side.

15:41.549 --> 15:44.160
Mm-hmm. Okay, all good points,
you know, strongly made.

15:44.204 --> 15:47.033
I like the hat. I was focused
on that most of the time.

15:47.076 --> 15:49.165
But I-I'm kind of leaning
towards you.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.819
I don't know why.
It might be the shirt.

15:50.862 --> 15:53.082
Look, majority rules may
have worked in medieval times,

15:53.126 --> 15:55.215
but we live
in a civil society now.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.086
And societies are judged on how

15:57.130 --> 15:59.045
they treat
their most vulnerable.

15:59.088 --> 16:02.091
See, we have to give voices
to those who have no voice.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.745
-He's right--
-Shut up, Dee! I'm talking!

16:03.788 --> 16:06.530
Women are always... Goddamn it.

16:06.574 --> 16:10.186
Look, what I was saying was
that we need to protect

16:10.230 --> 16:13.102
those most marginalized, okay?

16:13.146 --> 16:15.104
We need to change our attitudes.

16:15.148 --> 16:18.238
We need to change
our latitudes.

16:18.281 --> 16:21.328
And we need to vote
for a minorities-only bathroom.

16:21.371 --> 16:24.374
Okay, uh, also good, strong
points there made forcefully.

16:24.418 --> 16:27.073
I was distracted
by the shiny shirt. That's cool.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.683
I liked when you snapped at Dee.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.554
It was annoying
when she chimed in.

16:30.598 --> 16:33.209
Um, so maybe I'm leaning
towards you now. I don't know.

16:33.253 --> 16:36.169
-Okay, well, then that means
we're all voting for...
-Oh!

16:36.212 --> 16:39.607
Wait, wait, wait! I just looked
up the demographics of Philly.

16:39.650 --> 16:44.003
It says here that this city
is 54% women

16:44.046 --> 16:47.615
and 68% Christian.

16:47.658 --> 16:50.052
-Whoa.
-Which means that Mac and Dee

16:50.096 --> 16:52.011
are in the majority.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.882
-Wait, wait, wait, is that true?
-FRANK: Uh-huh.

16:53.925 --> 16:56.885
It also says that 52% are black,

16:56.928 --> 16:59.366
which means white men,

16:59.409 --> 17:01.150
like me and Dennis,

17:01.194 --> 17:03.326
are in the minority.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.067
DENNIS: Uh-oh, we're minorities,
which means that,

17:05.111 --> 17:06.634
by your own argument,

17:06.677 --> 17:09.332
we actually should get
the good bathroom.

17:09.376 --> 17:11.204
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I-I'm gay,

17:11.247 --> 17:12.857
so that-that still means
that I'm a minority.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.859
Yeah, but are you more gay
than you are Catholic?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.818
I don't know.
They're at war.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.341
It's all very confusing.
Where--

17:18.385 --> 17:20.343
What does it say
about transgenders...?

17:20.387 --> 17:22.128
-Less than one percent.
-Yeah.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.868
So what am I?

17:24.913 --> 17:26.262
You are white.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.090
Okay, and I'm a...?

17:28.134 --> 17:29.831
Man.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.876
And that would make me...?

17:31.920 --> 17:34.314
-In the minority.
-Which means I go towards...?

17:34.357 --> 17:35.880
Us. Y-You know what?
Frank, you explain it to him.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.360
I'm gonna-- I'm g--
[chuckles] I'll-I'll kill--

17:37.404 --> 17:39.536
-I'll-I'll smash him and, uh...
-You get the good bathroom.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.624
-If I come with you?
Okay, it was clear--
-Yes.

17:40.668 --> 17:41.930
It wasn't totally clear before,

17:41.973 --> 17:43.018
-but I get it now.
-It should've been.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.672
Oh, boy. Yeah, okay, so yes.

17:44.715 --> 17:47.240
-I got it.
-So all those in favor
of doing the actual right thing

17:47.283 --> 17:48.980
and giving the minorities
the good bathroom,

17:49.024 --> 17:50.547
-let's go ahead
and raise your hand.
-Yeah. Hey!

17:50.591 --> 17:52.158
-Okay, all right! Great, hey.
-FRANK: Okay.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.681
-Finally, a win
for straight white men, right?
-Great.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.161
-Now we're talking. Yeah.
-Yeah! Finally,
something for us.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.901
-We got it. Yeah.
Something for the guys.
-Something for us. Okay.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.120
-Yeah, let's go to Buffett!
-All right, we're gonna--

17:58.164 --> 17:59.513
-Anybody want cheeseburgers?
-All right.

17:59.556 --> 18:01.297
-I'm gonna get the grill ready.
-Well, yeah, hey, if I'm headed

18:01.341 --> 18:03.908
-to paradise,
I'm gonna want a cheeseburger.
-Let's roll!

18:03.952 --> 18:05.606
-What-what are you guys doing?
Let's go.
-Let's go.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.303
We're not going.

18:07.347 --> 18:08.348
What do you mean
you're not going? What?

18:08.391 --> 18:09.349
You used Buffett's words

18:09.392 --> 18:10.480
to promote discrimination, dude.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.829
It's not cool.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.440
No, but you guys have to go.
I mean,

18:13.483 --> 18:15.616
you're the only two other real
Parrotheads of the bunch.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.879
I mean, Frank's just going
'cause the chicks are wild.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.402
You know what I mean?

18:19.446 --> 18:21.404
-And, Charlie,
he doesn't know what's going on.
-I know.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.319
-Yes, I do.
-He has no-- No.
What are the songs?

18:23.363 --> 18:24.799
-What's another Buffett song?
-♪ Aruba, Jamaica...♪

18:24.842 --> 18:26.409
-That's Beach Boys.
-It is.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.671
-I don't know the songs.
-Yeah. That's the Beach Boys.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.847
FRANK: Well, there's no sense
in going to Buffett

18:29.891 --> 18:31.501
if they're not--
we're not all gonna go.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.068

-It hurts too much.
-I thought you-- Come on, man.

about you, Mac.

-That's not really a gay thing.
That's just a you thing.

-I'll probably stop doing that.

19:35.565 --> 19:36.958

-It's time to stop doing that.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.264

19:38.307 --> 19:39.961
we all identify very differently
out here.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.181
You know? But in there...

19:42.224 --> 19:44.226
in there,
we're not so different.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.836
In there, we're all the same.

In there, we're all just
disgusting, vulnerable, ashamed.

dumping in a shithouse.

19:52.016 --> 19:54.845
It's the one common thing
amongst a-a king and a pauper.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.934
-Right.
-You know? We all got
to take a shit.

19:56.978 --> 19:58.240
Yeah, right. Why are we trying
to make everyone

19:58.284 --> 19:59.459
feel comfortable in there?
When the truth is

19:59.502 --> 20:01.461
no one's ever gonna feel
comfortable shitting next

20:01.504 --> 20:03.376
-to another human being.
It's just awkward.
-Well, if we're never gonna get

20:03.419 --> 20:05.116
anybody to feel good
about shitting together,

20:05.160 --> 20:06.640

the problem?
