WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:07.175
RICHIE CRAWFORD.

00:07.241 --> 00:10.044
I TOLD YOU, NO CANDY
BEFORE DINNER.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.513
OH, YEAH, I FORGOT.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.049
HONEY, NOW THAT
YOU'RE A BIG BOY

00:15.116 --> 00:18.619
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
TO LISTEN TO YOUR CONSCIENCE.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.521
WHAT'S A CONSCIENCE?

00:20.588 --> 00:23.924
YOUR CONSCIENCE IS A TINY
LITTLE VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD

00:23.991 --> 00:26.660
THAT TELLS YOU WHEN YOU'RE
DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.396
UNDERSTAND?

00:28.462 --> 00:32.100
I GUESS SO.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT
EVEN LOUDER VOICE.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.735
LOUDER VOICE?

00:34.802 --> 00:38.672
YEAH, THAT ONE INSIDE MY TUMMY
THAT SAYS, "GIMME CANDY."

00:51.051 --> 00:53.053

01:06.300 --> 01:09.303
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:09.370 --> 01:13.407
* INSIDE
THESE GENTLE WALLS *

01:13.474 --> 01:17.077
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:17.145 --> 01:21.915
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:21.982 --> 01:24.885
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:24.952 --> 01:28.989
WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:29.056 --> 01:31.759
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:31.825 --> 01:35.463
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER THE BLUES
WITH TENDERNESS *

01:35.529 --> 01:39.233
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:39.300 --> 01:42.536
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU
ROOM FOR ME *

01:42.603 --> 01:46.807
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

01:46.874 --> 01:49.810
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:49.877 --> 01:53.481
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

02:11.799 --> 02:14.335
HERE'S THE SUGAR,
SUGAR.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.442
WOW.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.678
THERE'S TODD HELMS,
THAT NEW TRANSFER
STUDENT.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.714
ISN'T HE GORGEOUS?

02:26.780 --> 02:27.881
WELL, SEEMS A MIGHT TALL.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.584
PROBABLY
A PITUITARY PROBLEM.

02:33.421 --> 02:34.888
HI.

02:34.955 --> 02:35.923
HI.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.591
I'M TODD HELMS.

OH, ME, TOO.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.996
OH, I MEAN,
I'M LAURA WINSLOW.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.698
IS THE WAITER JOB OPEN?

02:44.765 --> 02:46.367
IT'S FILLED.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.871
NO, IT ISN'T.
APPLICATIONS
ARE OVER THERE.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.507
FILL ONE OUT,
THEN TALK TO
MY AUNT RACHEL.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.508
THANK YOU.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.776
THANK YOU.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.214
WELL, LAURA.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.785
LAURA.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.288
GEE, WILLAKERS.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.723
HER HORMONES
ARE STAMPEDING.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.528
UH, MR. SNIPLITSKY?

03:16.230 --> 03:18.366
RIGHT THIS WAY.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.635
HOW ARE YOU?

03:21.702 --> 03:23.737
HAVE A SEAT.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.743
NOW, UM...

03:29.810 --> 03:32.613
HAVE YOU EVER WORKED
IN A RESTAURANT BEFORE?

03:33.414 --> 03:36.584
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HAT.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.590
THANK YOU.
I DO TRY TO
LOOK MY BEST.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.326
IT GIVES THE PLACE
A SENSE OF STYLE.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.796
NOW, CAN YOU WORK
WEEKENDS?

03:48.862 --> 03:51.765
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HAT.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.173
MR. SNIPLITSKY,
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

04:00.240 --> 04:03.176
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HAT.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.113
I'M SORRY, SIR,
BUT I NEED A WAITER

04:06.179 --> 04:08.816
WHO CAN TALK
TO MY CUSTOMERS.

04:08.882 --> 04:09.983
UH, SIR,

04:10.050 --> 04:13.621
I DO HOPE
YOU UNDERSTAND.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.890
UH, GOODLUCK
IN AMERICA.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.727
YOU HAVE A LOVELY HAT.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.796
THANK YOU.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.698
BYE, NOW.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.866
BYE-BYE.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.735
WATCH
THAT CORNER.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.370
BYE-BYE.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.308
UH, ATTENTION, PLEASE.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.176
IF YOU WANT THIS JOB,

04:36.243 --> 04:39.347
YOU HAVE
TO SPEAK ENGLISH.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.622
YO.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.625
I TALK GOOD ENGLISH.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.127
OKAY.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.295
YOUR NAME IS...

04:55.363 --> 04:57.565
LOOK, I'LL NEED
WEEKENDS OFF,

04:57.631 --> 04:58.832
A MONTH'S PAID VACATION,

04:58.899 --> 05:02.703
AND FREE FOOD FOR ME
AND MY FRIENDS.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.472
NEXT!

05:18.552 --> 05:21.755
LAURA, WHY ARE YOU
OGLING THAT GIRAFFE?

05:21.822 --> 05:24.625
STEVE, TODD HAPPENS TO BE
A GREAT BASKETBALL PLAYER.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.695
HE LED HIS SCHOOL
TO THE STATE
CHAMPIONSHIP.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.130
WELL, I WAS
JUST RE-ELECTED
EQUIPMENT MANAGER

05:30.197 --> 05:32.433
OF THE GOLF TEAM.

05:33.601 --> 05:37.037
ANYBODY NEEDS A PUTTER,
THEY COME TO ME.

05:39.306 --> 05:40.541
WELCOME ABOARD.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.877
WELL, WE HAVE
OUR NEW WAITER.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.679
YES!

05:47.080 --> 05:48.382
I MEAN,
CONGRATULATIONS.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.684
THANKS.

05:52.620 --> 05:56.624
WELL, I HAVE A RIVAL FOR LAURA.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.827
A TALL RIVAL.

06:01.429 --> 06:05.733
WELL, THEN I'LL JUST
BUY ME SOME STILTS
AND WIN HER BACK.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.640
WHAT'S A THREE LETTER WORD
FOR PLEASURE?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.442
MEN.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.879
WHAT ABOUT FUN?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.648
THEY CAN BE.

06:25.185 --> 06:28.656
YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME TODAY.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.758
AFTER LUNCH,
I WENT JOGGING
IN THE PARK--

06:30.824 --> 06:31.925
COME ON, CARL.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.160
YOU? JOG?

06:35.996 --> 06:39.132
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I WAS CHASING
THE ICE CREAM TRUCK,

06:39.199 --> 06:42.703
BUT AS I JUMPED THE HEDGE,
I SAW SOMETHING SHINY.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.506
FEAST YOUR EYES ON THIS.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.409
CARL!

06:50.143 --> 06:51.244
ARE THOSE DIAMONDS REAL?

06:51.311 --> 06:52.513
EXTREMELY.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.914
THEY MUST BE WORTH
THOUSANDS.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.817
15,450.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.454
I HAD IT APPRAISED.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.623
OOH-WHEE!

07:02.690 --> 07:04.992
IT WAS JUST LYING THERE.
NOT A SOUL AROUND.

07:05.058 --> 07:05.926
SO IS IT OURS?

07:05.993 --> 07:08.929
ARE YOU NUTS?
WE CAN'T KEEP THIS.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.264
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE CAN'T KEEP IT.

07:11.331 --> 07:14.201
YEAH.
WE'LL SELL IT.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.038
WITH 15 GRAND,
WE CAN TAKE
THAT DREAM VACATION.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.072
OUR CARIBBEAN CRUISE?

07:19.139 --> 07:21.074
YOU GOT IT, BABE.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.512
* WON'T YOU LET ME
TAKE YOU ON A SEA CRUISE? *

07:24.578 --> 07:26.714
FORGET ABOUT THE CRUISE.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.982
DIAMONDS ARE
A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.720
UH, NOW, MOTHER,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.722
THERE WILL BE
PLENTY LEFT OVER.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.991
I'LL BUY YOU
A PRETTIER BRACELET--
LESS OSTENTATIOUS.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.760
YOU MEAN CHEAPER.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.464
MAMA, LET'S NOT
COUNT OUR DIAMONDS
BEFORE THEY'RE HOCKED.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.966
I HAVE TO TURN THIS IN,

07:46.033 --> 07:48.969
BUT IF NOBODY CLAIMS IT
WITHIN 30 DAYS, IT'S OURS.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.270
GOOD.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.404
UH-OH.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.473
HERE'S AN INSCRIPTION--

07:53.541 --> 07:56.243
"TO MY PRECIOUS
POOPSIE."

07:56.309 --> 07:57.377
WELL, THAT DOESN'T HELP.

07:57.444 --> 08:00.213
THIS CITY IS PACKED
WITH POOPSIES.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.584
LET'S LOOK AT THOSE
CRUISE BROCHURES.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.152
YOU STILL HAVE THEM?

08:05.218 --> 08:08.756
I'VE BEEN FILING THEM AWAY
UNDER "F"--FOR FAT CHANCE.

08:15.896 --> 08:19.667
23, 24, 25.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.770
TWO!

08:26.607 --> 08:28.208
I FEEL GREAT.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.277
NOT ME.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.079
I'VE LOST LAURA.

08:32.145 --> 08:35.248
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.
YOU NEVER HAD HER.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.087
THANKS, BUT THERE'S
A NEW WRINKLE.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.221
WHAT IS IT?

08:41.288 --> 08:42.890
YOU KNOW
TODD HELMS.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.725
SURE.
GREAT BALL PLAYER.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.927
REAL NICE GUY.
BABES LOVE HIM.

08:46.994 --> 08:50.564
A SIMPLE
"I KNOW THE DUDE"
WOULD HAVE SUFFICED.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.499
WELL, WHAT ABOUT HIM?

08:52.566 --> 08:54.735
WELL, HE'S FLUNKING
GEOMETRY,

08:54.802 --> 08:56.970
WHICH MEANS
HE'LL GET BOUNCED OFF
THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.773
HIS POP WILL GROUND HIM,
MEANING NO DATES WITH LAURA,

08:59.840 --> 09:02.876
WHICH IS GOOD FOR ME,
EXCEPT TODD ASKED ME
TO TUTOR HIM.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.278
NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
THEM APPLES.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.982
WHAT WAS
THAT FIRST THING AGAIN?

09:09.917 --> 09:11.852
THINK, MAN.
TODD'S MY RIVAL.

09:11.919 --> 09:15.823
THE ONLY OBSTACLE
BETWEEN ME
AND MY LADY LOVE.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.859
STEVE, THE ONLY OBSTACLE
BETWEEN YOU AND LAURA

09:18.926 --> 09:20.928
IS YOU.

09:25.866 --> 09:30.103
BOY, I HOLD TODD'S FATE
IN THE PALM OF MY HAND.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.571
SHOULD I TEACH HIM
TO FLY HIGH

09:31.639 --> 09:34.007
OR SQUASH HIM
LIKE AN INSECT?

09:39.913 --> 09:42.349
MOM,
WHAT'S THE CAPITAL
OF BELGIUM?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.984
I'LL GIVE YOU
A HINT--

09:44.051 --> 09:46.620
WHICH VEGETABLE
DO YOU HATE THE MOST?

09:46.687 --> 09:49.890
THE CAPITAL OF BELGIUM
IS BROCCOLI?

09:51.158 --> 09:52.392
BRUSSELS, JUDY.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.928
AS IN BRUSSELS SPROUTS?

09:56.196 --> 09:59.967
I'LL LET THAT ALL SINK IN
WHILE I GO PLAY NINTENDO.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.205
HELLO, BABE.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.339
HI, HONEY.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.910
ANY CALLS TODAY
ABOUT THE BRACELET?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.879
NOT ONE.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.216
ALTHOUGH I AM
SORT OF SURPRISED,

10:16.283 --> 10:20.020
WHAT WITH THAT BIG AD
YOU PUT IN THE PAPER.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.458
CARL, YOU DID
PLACE THE AD.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.661
OH, SURE.
FULL PAGE.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.831
YOU POPPED FOR
A FULL-PAGE AD

10:30.898 --> 10:33.566
IN THE CHICAGO CHRONICLE?

10:33.633 --> 10:36.169
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.071
WHAT, EXACTLY?

10:38.138 --> 10:39.907
IT'S, UH...

10:39.973 --> 10:42.743
IT'S IN
THE AMISH ALMANAC.

10:45.679 --> 10:50.350
HARRIETTE, I'M SORRY,
BUT I FEEL WE FULFILLED
OUR OBLIGATION HERE.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.852
WE TURNED
THE BRACELET IN.

10:51.919 --> 10:55.388
NOW IT'S UP TO POOPSIE
TO CLAIM IT.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.926
CARL, THINK ABOUT IT.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.093
RIGHT NOW,
POOR POOPSIE'S

11:00.160 --> 11:02.595
PROBABLY
CRYING HER EYES OUT.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.866
HARRIETTE, BELIEVE ME,
POOPSIE IS NOT POOR.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.635
WELL, EVEN SO.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.704
WE HAVE TO TRY
TO FIND THE OWNER.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.672
THEN IF NOBODY
CLAIMS IT,

11:12.740 --> 11:16.810
YOU'LL HAVE
A CLEARER CONSCIENCE.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.684
NOT LIKE I DID
ANYTHING WRONG.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.927
MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR.

11:37.965 --> 11:41.001
IS IT REALLY, CARL?

11:42.535 --> 11:43.536
WHO ARE YOU?

11:43.603 --> 11:45.472
I'M YOUR CONSCIENCE,

11:45.538 --> 11:47.975
AND I'M NOT
FEELING VERY CLEAR.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.744
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:50.811 --> 11:51.979
YOU HAVEN'T
REALLY TRIED TO FIND

11:52.045 --> 11:54.481
THE OWNER OF THE BRACELET,
HAVE YOU, CARL?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.218
WELL, I...I...

12:02.189 --> 12:04.691
HEY, CARL. DON'T
LISTEN TO THAT WIMP!

12:04.758 --> 12:07.427
IT'S FINDERS-KEEPERS,
LOSERS-WEEPERS.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.697
HE'S GOT A POINT.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.700
YEAH, AND IT'S
ON HIS TAIL.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.634
SSS!

12:14.701 --> 12:15.969
HEH HEH HEH!

12:18.171 --> 12:20.941
BESIDES,
YOU'RE A POLICE OFFICER.

12:21.008 --> 12:24.311
IT'S YOUR DUTY
TO HELP PEOPLE.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.246
HE'S GOT A POINT.

12:26.313 --> 12:29.082
YEAH, ON HIS HEAD.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.885
CARL...

12:31.952 --> 12:33.586
CHEATERS NEVER PROSPER.

12:33.653 --> 12:34.888
SURE THEY DO.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.190
WAKE UP AND SMELL
THE SULFUR.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.227
YOU'VE WORKED HARD,
BEEN HONEST,
WHAT'S IT GOT YOU?

12:40.293 --> 12:43.296
A SECOND MORTGAGE,
AND A $10-A-DAY
DOUGHNUT HABIT.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.566
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, BUB.

12:46.633 --> 12:50.470
HEY, THAT'S BEELZEBUB
TO YOU, BRO.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.241
CARL, IGNORE HIM.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.709
HE'S NAUGHTY.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.013
HEY.
BUTT OUT!

13:00.080 --> 13:02.883
ARE YOU
WILLING TO TRADE

21:30.523 --> 21:31.658
THE ONLY SONG

21:31.724 --> 21:33.259
IS SWEET

21:33.326 --> 21:34.927
AHA! SO YOU REALIZED

21:34.994 --> 21:39.165
A STRONG MIND
