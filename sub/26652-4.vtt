It's time for you to behave, or
else your cabin will be banned

21:20.409 --> 21:22.846
from the July Jamboree.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.894
- The only way we are going to
get any information

21:26.937 --> 21:28.635
from these girls
is to infiltrate their clique.

21:28.678 --> 21:31.028
- How are we supposed
to do that? We're not kids.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.856
- Funny you should say that.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.816
Constantine gave me a potion
that would turn us into kids

21:35.859 --> 21:37.774
only temporarily.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.256
- Wha--
Even if it works, Sara,

21:41.300 --> 21:42.866
I wouldn't have any idea
how to act like a kid

21:42.910 --> 21:44.390
because I've never been one.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.870
All my childhood memories
are fake, remember?

21:49.612 --> 21:51.527
- How are we going to find the
kids with that dangly thing?

21:51.571 --> 21:53.616
- You know, this ritual
usually works best

21:53.660 --> 21:56.097
when someone
isn't yammering in my ear hole.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.533
- Well, you want
to find the kids,

21:57.577 --> 21:59.230
we got to do it
the old-fashioned way.

21:59.274 --> 22:00.406
Study their tracks.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.016
It's a good thing
I came prepared,

22:02.059 --> 22:03.713
because one step
in the wrong direction here,

22:03.757 --> 22:05.411
and you'll be traveling
for miles in the wrong--

22:05.454 --> 22:09.850
- Damn it, you Nandy Pandy,
I said I need silence.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.460
- Oh, you meant right now.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.549
I'm sorry,
I thought you meant--

22:16.335 --> 22:18.249
Why are you being such a jerk?

22:18.293 --> 22:19.903
- Because you shouldn't
even be out here

22:19.947 --> 22:22.297
chasing a magical creature,
all right?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.081
It's too dangerous.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.389
You're lucky
you're out here with me,

22:27.433 --> 22:29.391
because I can keep us alive
on bugs and berries alone.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.612
- You know, this has nothing
to do with survival in the wild

22:32.655 --> 22:34.788
and everything to do with
surviving magical creatures

22:34.831 --> 22:36.703
and those who dabble
in the dark arts.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.531

stranger to the world of magic.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.271
- Yeah.

22:40.315 --> 22:42.535

heard how Nora Darhk had you

22:42.578 --> 22:45.276

of her wicked little hand.

even have to ask

22:47.017 --> 22:48.976

did she?

22:49.019 --> 22:53.502
No, you just gave it away
like biscuits at tea time.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.939
- Nora and I have a mutual
respect for each other.

22:55.983 --> 22:58.289
It's not like
I was tripping over myself--

23:00.422 --> 23:02.511

♪

23:06.602 --> 23:09.431

after it eats the kids?

23:11.999 --> 23:14.697
What are we looking for?
Some sort of snake monster?

23:14.741 --> 23:17.439
- The answer is in this book.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.876

a magical Audubon guide?

23:19.920 --> 23:21.835
Neat-o.

- Mmm.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.752
It's good.
What is it?

23:25.795 --> 23:29.669
- Hooch. I spent a little time
in a Siberian gulag.

23:29.712 --> 23:32.193
Got a taste for it.

23:32.236 --> 23:35.370
Where I was
it felt like 500 years.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.067
Time worked differently
in that realm.

23:37.111 --> 23:40.636
- Oh, I've been in a lot of
cages, but not a magical one.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.290
What was it like?

23:42.333 --> 23:44.553
- The inside of my cage
was a constant battle

23:44.597 --> 23:47.251
between creatures
from your worst nightmare.

23:47.295 --> 23:50.516
I, uh, got to know some of them
better than I wanted to.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.735
It was a dismal
and a dark dimension,

23:52.779 --> 23:54.955
like nothing
here on Earth.

23:54.998 --> 23:57.436
And I'll be damned
if I'm ever going back.

23:57.479 --> 24:00.830
- Well, cheers to that.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.833
[children laughing,
indistinct chatter]

24:07.620 --> 24:09.839
- No, it's an "I'm sorry"
bracelet.

24:09.883 --> 24:12.494
I shouldn't
have run off like that.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.278
It's just that
you know I'm not normal,

24:14.322 --> 24:16.106
and I think you hit
a nerve or something.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.065
- No, I'm sorry.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.545
I never even thought
about the fact

24:19.588 --> 24:21.024
that you'd
never been a kid.

24:21.068 --> 24:23.766
- Yeah.
- But this is really good.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.160
- Ugh. I confiscated
it from Alexis.

24:26.203 --> 24:27.988
See, I'm weird. I--

24:28.031 --> 24:30.512
Do you know that those two
actors who are my parents--

24:30.556 --> 24:32.732
I keep a picture of them
on my desk in my office

24:32.775 --> 24:34.777
just so I can try to feel
a little bit normal.

24:34.821 --> 24:36.562
- Yeah, that is anything
but normal.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.085
- Yeah.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.000
- Guys. I think
we've ID'd our monster.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.871
Constantine and I found
a skin suit

24:41.915 --> 24:44.221
shed by something
called a shtriga.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.093
- A shtriga.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.486
It's a vampiric witch.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.965
It feeds off the life force
of children.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.315
Bloody brilliant
setting up shop at summer camp.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.100
- Ah, there's some good news,
sort of.

24:53.143 --> 24:55.537
Uh, it says here the shtriga
feeds slowly off its prey

24:55.581 --> 24:58.192
draining its life energy
over a course of days,

24:58.235 --> 25:00.934

could still be alive.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.544

I'm crazy,

25:08.942 --> 25:11.031

to protect them

25:11.074 --> 25:13.903
is by becoming one of them
and lure the creature out?

25:13.947 --> 25:16.340
We'll be the bait.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.255
- What if Constantine's
potion doesn't work on me?

25:18.299 --> 25:20.301
- There's only one way
to find out.

25:20.344 --> 25:23.217
And if it does, I'll be
with you every step of the way.

25:23.260 --> 25:25.828
