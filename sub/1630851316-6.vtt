WEBVTT

00:11.045 --> 00:12.943
He's gonna kill me.
He's gonna kill me.

00:18.432 --> 00:21.504
6:03, Felix.
Coach is gonna kill you.

00:29.132 --> 00:32.066
I'm sorry, Coach.
My alarm didn't go off.

00:33.309 --> 00:35.069
Coach?

00:35.173 --> 00:36.898
Commander? Sir?

01:42.205 --> 01:43.896
This is weird, right?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.312
That's one word for it.

01:45.415 --> 01:46.692
I think it's kind of nice.

01:46.796 --> 01:48.349
Well, looks like
the, uh, new guy

01:48.453 --> 01:50.075
is trying to score
some brownie points.

01:50.179 --> 01:52.698
Or in this case, pastry points.

01:52.802 --> 01:55.149
I think Parker said
these are Polish kolaczki.

01:55.253 --> 01:57.427
Wait, wait, wait.
What if this is a test?

01:57.531 --> 01:58.670
To see who prefers

01:58.773 --> 02:00.223
plain over powdered sugar?

02:00.327 --> 02:02.122
Well, maybe.

02:02.225 --> 02:04.331
What does taking plain over
powdered sugar say about you?

02:04.434 --> 02:05.918
It says I'm hungry.

02:06.022 --> 02:07.437
Hey, I'm serious, guys.
We barely know this guy.

02:07.541 --> 02:09.336
What if he's playing mind games?

02:09.439 --> 02:12.304
Or he's just trying to be nice
his first week on the job.

02:12.408 --> 02:14.479
- I'm not that easy.
- Me, neither.

02:16.205 --> 02:17.309
Well, now I feel like
I should put it back.

02:17.413 --> 02:18.241
Morning.

02:18.345 --> 02:19.691
Morning.
On it.

02:20.726 --> 02:22.728
Whoa. What's the rush?

02:22.832 --> 02:25.593
You didn't come in to tell us
we have a body, or...?

02:25.697 --> 02:28.458
No. How was everybody's weekend?

02:29.563 --> 02:31.151
Good.

02:31.254 --> 02:32.290
Uneventful.

02:32.393 --> 02:33.670
Same.

02:33.774 --> 02:36.466
Anybody catch
that Nats game last night?

02:39.400 --> 02:40.746
Special Agent McGee.

02:41.782 --> 02:44.198
Yeah. Uh, one sec.

02:44.302 --> 02:46.545
Uh, dispatch has a body.
You want to talk to them?

02:49.824 --> 02:51.101
Um, yeah.

02:52.551 --> 02:54.070
Okay, got it. Thanks.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.176
Guess they don't have
your number yet.

02:56.279 --> 02:59.040
We got a dead sailor at the Navy
Athletic Complex in Norfolk.

02:59.144 --> 03:03.044
Well, in that case, my delicious
mind games will have to wait.

03:04.805 --> 03:06.703
Let's roll.

03:06.807 --> 03:08.981
How did he hear us?

03:13.296 --> 03:15.643
Victim is Navy Commander
Henry Davis,

03:15.747 --> 03:18.025
head of the All-Navy
Sports program.

03:18.128 --> 03:20.545
Worked with some of the
best athletes in the world.

03:20.648 --> 03:22.581
I had a buddy who played
basketball in the Army.

03:22.685 --> 03:24.204
Serious work.

03:24.307 --> 03:25.998
Even more so in this case.

03:26.102 --> 03:27.276
The other military branches,

03:27.379 --> 03:29.036
your sport
is your primary mission.

03:29.139 --> 03:31.072
Navy athletes are
expected to compete

03:31.176 --> 03:32.660
at an international level
while maintaining

03:32.764 --> 03:34.490
their active-duty assignments.

03:34.593 --> 03:36.250
Dual threats.

03:36.354 --> 03:38.183
One of the athletes found him
early this morning.

03:38.287 --> 03:41.359
Yeah, I would say rigor
suggests the time of death

03:41.462 --> 03:43.223
was between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m.

03:43.326 --> 03:45.604
You got a cause of death, Doc?

03:45.708 --> 03:47.123
The only visible wound here

03:47.227 --> 03:49.505
is a blunt force trauma
to the temple.

03:49.608 --> 03:51.092
Whoever, uh, killed him

03:51.196 --> 03:52.577
definitely had their pick
of murder weapons.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.096
You got shot puts, hammers,

03:55.200 --> 03:56.270
javelins.

03:56.374 --> 03:57.409
Headwind and tailwind versions.

03:57.513 --> 03:59.377
Wow.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.725
I didn't have you pegged as
the track-and-field type, McGee.

04:02.828 --> 04:05.521
I contain multitudes,
Agent Parker.

04:06.867 --> 04:08.075
Just curious,
what, uh, type

04:08.178 --> 04:10.146
did you have me pegged as?

04:11.285 --> 04:13.770
Uh, maybe "pegged"
was the wrong word.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.153
Well, in any case,

04:17.257 --> 04:19.224
I don't think that the murder
weapon came from this room.

04:20.432 --> 04:23.159
This wound here
appears to be a burn.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.229
From what?

04:24.333 --> 04:25.817
I'm not sure.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.026
I've never seen dermal stippling
quite like this before.

04:28.129 --> 04:29.545
So what are we looking for?

04:30.580 --> 04:32.064
I don't know.

04:32.168 --> 04:34.101
Then I guess we keep looking.

04:34.204 --> 04:36.379
Commander's office
is right next door.

04:37.415 --> 04:39.140
No, you-you don't understand.

04:39.244 --> 04:40.418
I'm never late.

04:40.521 --> 04:41.764
Why were you this morning?

04:41.867 --> 04:43.317
Coach and I have been
doing two-a-days

04:43.421 --> 04:45.664
to get ready for
the Military World Games.

04:45.768 --> 04:47.528
Time trials are next week.

04:47.632 --> 04:51.118
Practice,
plus my regular-duty assignment.

04:51.221 --> 04:52.740
It caught up with me.

04:52.844 --> 04:54.708
I overslept.

04:54.811 --> 04:56.468
It's hard enough to
handle one career.

04:56.572 --> 04:57.849
You handle two.

04:57.952 --> 05:00.369
I c-- I couldn't do it
without Coach.

05:00.472 --> 05:02.302
So the two of you were close?

05:03.337 --> 05:05.374
I was heading down
a bad path as a kid.

05:05.477 --> 05:07.859
Drinking, fighting.

05:07.962 --> 05:09.861
Joined the Navy 'cause
my guidance counselor

05:09.964 --> 05:11.656
thought it'd
straighten me out.

05:11.759 --> 05:14.452
Well? Did it?

05:14.555 --> 05:16.799
Not really.

05:16.902 --> 05:19.353
I was looking
at a dishonorable discharge

05:19.457 --> 05:22.391
until Coach Davis heard
I was all-state in high school,

05:22.494 --> 05:24.324
asked me to try out
for the Navy team.

05:24.427 --> 05:26.498
Running turned things
around for you.

05:26.602 --> 05:28.638
No.

05:28.742 --> 05:30.640
Coach Davis did that.

05:30.744 --> 05:33.574
He gave me
a place to belong.

05:33.678 --> 05:36.715
Gave me something else
to do other than drink.

05:36.819 --> 05:39.200
You any idea
who might want him dead?

05:39.304 --> 05:41.133
That's just it.

05:41.237 --> 05:42.790
No one would.

05:42.894 --> 05:44.620
I mean, Coach is the...

05:44.723 --> 05:46.863
Coach...

05:46.967 --> 05:49.521
<i>was</i> the best,

05:49.625 --> 05:52.317
on and off the track.

05:54.837 --> 05:57.322
Well, he was the best
on the track, that's for sure.

05:57.426 --> 06:01.188
Commander Davis has quite
the hardware collection.

06:01.291 --> 06:02.845
Ah, must be the awards
that didn't fit

06:02.948 --> 06:05.641
in the trophy case outside.

06:05.744 --> 06:08.506
Hmm. This guy's
a regular John Wooden.

06:08.609 --> 06:10.853
The basketball coach.

06:10.956 --> 06:12.613
I loved his book
on leadership.

06:12.717 --> 06:14.788
Pyramid of Success. Good stuff.

06:14.891 --> 06:16.237
Mm.

06:22.485 --> 06:24.487
I wonder if the commander
read it, too.

06:24.591 --> 06:26.593
Sure seems like he knew
the winning secret.

06:26.696 --> 06:28.388
Speaking of secrets...

06:29.699 --> 06:30.700
You got something?

06:31.770 --> 06:33.185
Hidden compartment.

06:43.299 --> 06:44.887
Drugs.

06:46.371 --> 06:48.718
Yeah.
The performance-enhancing kind.

06:48.822 --> 06:50.755
Testosterone, metenolone.

06:50.858 --> 06:53.482
Wonder what our coach
was doing with steroids?

07:02.560 --> 07:05.286
Commander Henry Davis,
decorated officer

07:05.390 --> 07:07.357
and former
world-class runner himself.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.842
He worked his way up

07:08.945 --> 07:11.223
to become head
of the All-Navy Sports program.

07:11.327 --> 07:13.294
These athletes compete
in everything

07:13.398 --> 07:15.193
from the Military World Games
to the Olympics.

07:15.296 --> 07:16.884
I'd hate to find out
that the drugs

07:16.988 --> 07:19.542
in the commander's desk
had something to do with that.

07:19.646 --> 07:21.579
- Could be why he was killed.
- Yeah.

07:21.682 --> 07:22.856
Maybe somebody
found out the coach

07:22.959 --> 07:24.892
was doping his athletes,
got upset.

07:24.996 --> 07:26.515
Not <i>athletes.</i>

07:26.618 --> 07:28.551
In addition
to his administrative duties,

07:28.655 --> 07:30.864
Davis coached
one person at a time.

07:30.967 --> 07:32.382
Someone who was
stationed locally

07:32.486 --> 07:33.832
and who he saw
extra potential in.

07:33.936 --> 07:36.007
That narrows down the list.

07:36.110 --> 07:38.906
Davis was currently training
Petty Officer Felix Cross.

07:39.838 --> 07:41.495
We questioned him this morning,

07:41.599 --> 07:43.048
but that was before we knew
about the drugs.

07:43.152 --> 07:44.981
Let's see what Felix
has to say now,

07:45.085 --> 07:46.949
and have him pee in a cup
while you're at it.

07:47.052 --> 07:48.606
Yeah.

07:48.709 --> 07:50.780
Who did the coach
work with before Felix?

07:51.609 --> 07:53.645
- Petty Officer First
Class Jamie Anderson.

07:53.749 --> 07:54.922
Now let's talk to him, too.

07:55.026 --> 07:56.027
Let's start
working our way back.

07:56.130 --> 07:57.269
Actually,

07:57.373 --> 07:58.754
Petty OfficerAnderson

07:58.857 --> 08:00.341
was killed last year,
not in combat.

08:00.445 --> 08:02.309
Some sort
of car accident.

08:02.412 --> 08:04.898
That makes two dead.
That's a small world.

08:05.001 --> 08:07.348
- You got details?
- No,

08:07.452 --> 08:08.729
but Anderson's parents
still live in D.C.

08:08.833 --> 08:11.491
Bring them in.
Let's have a chat.

08:15.149 --> 08:16.875
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Oh, McGee. Great timing.

08:16.979 --> 08:18.981
I was just about to call
Parker down for an update.

08:19.084 --> 08:20.430
Well, I like updates.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.397
Would you like an update?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.812
I would love an update.

08:22.916 --> 08:24.262
Let's do an update.

08:24.365 --> 08:25.435
I finally figured out

08:25.539 --> 08:26.920
what our mystery
stippling was here.

08:27.023 --> 08:29.336
Commander Davis was killed by...

08:29.439 --> 08:30.717
a gunshot.

08:30.820 --> 08:31.925
No entry wound.

08:32.028 --> 08:33.582
That's because there was
no bullet.

08:33.685 --> 08:36.654
This man was killed
by a blank round.

08:36.757 --> 08:38.966
Not the most effective choice
of murder weapon.

08:39.070 --> 08:40.485
No, but it works.

08:40.589 --> 08:42.798
Even blank rounds
aren't entirely blank.

08:42.901 --> 08:44.834
Right, they use a wadding
to hold in the propellant.

08:44.938 --> 08:47.112
Which, in this case,
was gunpowder.

08:47.216 --> 08:48.976
Hence the burn on the temple.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.358
- So he was shot point-blank?
- Yeah.

08:51.461 --> 08:54.741
The paper wadding
was ejected from the barrel

08:54.844 --> 08:56.915
and shattered his temporal bone.

08:57.019 --> 08:59.435
The bone fragments
pierced the brain.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.816
Death was instantaneous.

09:00.919 --> 09:02.749
Think this could have
been a suicide, maybe?

09:02.852 --> 09:05.683
I didn't find any GSR
on the victim's hands,

09:05.786 --> 09:07.685
so that means
someone else pulled the trigger.

09:07.788 --> 09:10.032
Why try and kill someone
with a blank round?

09:10.135 --> 09:12.793
Eh, starter pistols
could use blank rounds.

09:12.897 --> 09:14.899
At least they used to
before everything went digital.

09:15.002 --> 09:18.040
A track coach murdered
with a starter pistol.

09:18.143 --> 09:19.766
Pretty symbolic.

09:19.869 --> 09:22.838
Maybe the killer
is trying to send a message.

09:22.941 --> 09:24.943
Yeah, but what's the message?

09:25.047 --> 09:27.359
This was taken after
the Armed Forces Championship,

09:27.463 --> 09:30.604
when Jamie broke
the Navy record.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.710
We were so proud of him.

09:32.813 --> 09:34.746
Yeah. So was Coach.

09:34.850 --> 09:36.437
You were close
with Commander Davis?

09:36.541 --> 09:38.647
We considered him family.

09:38.750 --> 09:42.685
He was just as devastated as
we were when Jamie was killed.

09:42.789 --> 09:44.791
Drunk driver.

09:44.894 --> 09:46.724
We're sorry for your loss.

09:47.932 --> 09:49.865
From what we understand,
training

09:49.968 --> 09:53.731
under Coach Davis was something
of, uh, of an honor in itself.

09:53.834 --> 09:56.768
Yeah. Coach only took
the best under his wing.

09:56.872 --> 09:58.459
He had the record
to prove it.

09:58.563 --> 10:01.566
Did he ever...

10:01.670 --> 10:05.501
...use performance enhancers
as part of his training regimen?

10:07.261 --> 10:10.644
You mean, like, steroids.

10:11.749 --> 10:12.819
That's quite an accusation.

10:12.922 --> 10:14.821
We're not accusing anyone.

10:14.924 --> 10:16.650
- Well, you'd better have
some proof before you do.

10:16.754 --> 10:18.548
Just the accusation
could disgrace

10:18.652 --> 10:19.998
the entire program.

10:20.102 --> 10:21.482
That's hundreds
of dedicated athletes.

10:21.586 --> 10:22.656
Not to mention our Jamie.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.071
Jamie would never dope.

10:24.175 --> 10:26.108
And Coach Davis wasn't one
to cut corners.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.215
According to phone records,

10:30.319 --> 10:32.252
Commander Davis called
your house two days ago?

10:32.355 --> 10:34.806
Yeah, that's right.
I talked to him.

10:34.910 --> 10:37.050
Ever since Jamie died,

10:37.153 --> 10:39.604
Hank would call us
every once in a while.

10:39.708 --> 10:41.986
You know, to check in, make sure
we were still doing okay.

10:42.089 --> 10:44.816
Did he mention
anything unusual the other day?

10:44.920 --> 10:47.612
Uh, the same old small talk.

10:47.716 --> 10:50.166
We're trying to get justice
for Hank.

10:50.270 --> 10:53.238
Anything he might have said
could help us.

10:54.377 --> 10:57.553
Well, I mean, it's
nothing specific,

10:57.657 --> 11:01.799
but I could tell that he
seemed a little... distracted.

11:01.902 --> 11:04.802
But when I asked what was
wrong, he said he didn't want

11:04.905 --> 11:06.458
to burden us
with his problems.

11:06.562 --> 11:09.634
Any idea what that problem
might be?

11:09.738 --> 11:11.981
<i>Coach wasn't giving us drugs,</i>

11:12.085 --> 11:14.674
and this will prove it.

11:14.777 --> 11:16.676
You guys are way off base.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.127
Look, we're just trying
to find out why he got killed.

11:20.231 --> 11:23.027
Well, maybe the steroids
weren't even his.

11:23.130 --> 11:24.545
Ever think of that?

11:24.649 --> 11:26.824
Yes, but they were
hidden in his desk,

11:26.927 --> 11:29.205
and we couldn't find
anyone else's fingerprints.

11:29.309 --> 11:31.898
Whatever.
You should be out there

11:32.001 --> 11:33.623
trying to catch the killer.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.729
Not wasting time in here.

11:36.868 --> 11:37.731
Hey. Hey.

11:39.284 --> 11:40.561
Breathe.

11:40.665 --> 11:42.149
Breathe.

11:42.253 --> 11:44.013
I get what you're going through.

11:44.117 --> 11:45.877
Doubt that.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.675
Coach was family, right?

11:54.058 --> 11:56.785
Well, I just lost
some family, too.

11:56.888 --> 11:59.132
Yeah?

12:01.099 --> 12:02.791
What did you do?

12:02.894 --> 12:06.070
Well, I didn't pick a fight
with a towel dispenser.

12:07.140 --> 12:08.935
I channeled
my emotions

12:09.038 --> 12:11.247
into something positive.

12:11.351 --> 12:14.319
Something positive like, what,
finding Coach's killer?

12:14.423 --> 12:17.633
Like the time trials
you have coming up.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.601
You run your race,
and you let us run ours.

12:20.705 --> 12:23.294
Running isn't gonna
help me forget.

12:26.090 --> 12:27.919
Do you have a sponsor?

12:28.023 --> 12:30.784
Navy athletes can't sign
endorsement deals.

12:30.888 --> 12:32.855
No, not that kind of sponsor.

12:34.857 --> 12:37.273
The one that you call on
when, uh,

12:37.377 --> 12:40.138
you feel like you're falling
back into old habits.

12:40.242 --> 12:41.933
Like drinking?

12:43.210 --> 12:45.765
It's not like that, man.

12:46.835 --> 12:48.319
Something else on your mind?

12:49.354 --> 12:51.701
Coach.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.980
You asked me who had problems
with him, right?

12:54.083 --> 12:57.880
Well, I wasn't totally
honest earlier.

12:57.984 --> 13:02.091
I saw Coach get into
this argument the other day.

13:02.195 --> 13:05.301
I have never seen him
lose his temper like that.

13:05.405 --> 13:07.959
Who was he arguing with?

13:08.063 --> 13:10.686
Petty Officer Third Class
Kyle Seward.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.136
Also stationed at Norfolk.

13:12.239 --> 13:15.208
And also an All-Navy athlete
in wrestling.

13:15.311 --> 13:17.797
- Flyweight?
- Actually, this
is an old photo.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.143
He's moved up a few classes.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.803
He went from a skipping stone
to the Rock.

13:23.906 --> 13:25.149
All in less than a year.

13:25.252 --> 13:26.598
Think he had a little help?

13:26.702 --> 13:27.703
Take a look

13:27.807 --> 13:29.809
at his social media profile.

13:32.328 --> 13:33.364
Notice anything?

13:33.467 --> 13:35.953
I notice good form.

13:36.056 --> 13:37.057
Outside of the gym selfies.

13:37.161 --> 13:38.783
Vintage 'vette.

13:38.887 --> 13:40.889
Eh, nice car.

13:40.992 --> 13:43.236
Yeah, too nice. $100,000 car

13:43.339 --> 13:45.341
on an E-4 salary?

13:45.445 --> 13:46.791
Kyle's got a side business.

13:46.895 --> 13:48.068
Maybe that's what the argument

13:48.172 --> 13:49.242
with Coach was about.

13:49.345 --> 13:50.864
He got caught selling?

13:50.968 --> 13:53.039
Or maybe Coach was the customer.

13:53.142 --> 13:54.834
Wouldn't be the first
time someone got

13:54.937 --> 13:56.111
into a fight
with their drug dealer.

13:56.214 --> 13:58.078
Well, I say we bring Kyle in
and ask.

13:58.182 --> 14:00.736
We could, but this
is just theory right now.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.151
If we really want him to talk,

14:02.255 --> 14:03.118
we got to come up with
something concrete.

14:03.221 --> 14:04.395
If this guy is dealing,

14:04.498 --> 14:05.741
let's catch him in the act.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.674
I can go to the gym.

14:07.777 --> 14:09.883
Make him, uh, sell me steroids
and take him down.

14:09.987 --> 14:11.989
I mean, what is he working on
today? Biceps, triceps?

14:12.092 --> 14:13.438
Legs?

14:13.542 --> 14:15.785
According to his
most recent post,

14:15.889 --> 14:17.926
it is "recovery day in the tub."

14:18.029 --> 14:22.033
Even better. I could use
some time in the Jacuzzi.

14:25.209 --> 14:27.280
Great. Mm-hmm.

14:27.383 --> 14:29.075
Thanks.

14:30.352 --> 14:33.182
Don't worry, man.
You'll get used to it.

14:33.286 --> 14:35.426
Then you'll crave it,
bro. Seriously.

14:35.529 --> 14:37.255
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

14:37.359 --> 14:40.741
Yeah, anything to get rid
of this, uh, back injury, right?

14:40.845 --> 14:44.262
Oh, you use the cold to cut
down on the inflammation?

14:44.366 --> 14:46.851
- Smart.
- Yeah, doctor's orders.

15:02.556 --> 15:04.800
You're Kyle Seward, right?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.836
Yeah, I've seen you
on your social.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.838
You bulked up pretty quick.

15:08.942 --> 15:12.842
Why do I feel like
you don't have a back injury?

15:12.946 --> 15:14.327
You're here for free advice.

15:14.430 --> 15:17.364
I'm here for something else.
Something, uh...

15:22.231 --> 15:24.164
Something I'm willing
to pay for.

15:24.268 --> 15:26.270
I hear
you're the man, uh,

15:26.373 --> 15:29.963
you know, who can find,
uh, things.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.861
Don't know what
you're talking about.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.035
Wait, what's the problem?

15:33.139 --> 15:34.347
You, actually.

15:34.450 --> 15:36.245
Approaching me in public.

15:36.349 --> 15:38.075
Wait, I have needs.

15:38.178 --> 15:41.319
I bet you do, but I guess
shop's closed.

15:41.423 --> 15:43.011
Hey, I got-- I got cash, man.
I got money.

15:43.114 --> 15:45.496
I got money. You name the price.

15:45.599 --> 15:47.222
Here.

15:52.330 --> 15:56.127
We do this, I never want
to see your face again.

15:56.231 --> 15:57.818
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can... Yeah.

15:57.922 --> 15:59.096
Uh, yeah, I can live with that.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.099
Meet me out back in ten minutes.

16:07.104 --> 16:10.486
All right, um,
I'm not sure what you're into,

16:10.590 --> 16:14.076
but, uh, I got some options.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.492
I got some old shoes.

16:16.596 --> 16:19.875
Huh? Uh... Oh.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.394
I got some old boxer shorts.

16:21.497 --> 16:23.810
I was actually looking
for, uh... I know.

16:23.913 --> 16:26.123
Something a little more used.
Okay, uh...

16:26.226 --> 16:29.436
Oh. Huh?

16:29.540 --> 16:31.507
An Olympic bronze medalist
wore this for two weeks.

16:31.611 --> 16:33.993
Never washed. I could
let it go for, uh...

16:34.096 --> 16:35.442
$400.

16:35.546 --> 16:37.272
- Dude, are you messing with me?
- Okay, fine.

16:38.618 --> 16:40.516
$350.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.518
Final offer.

16:52.114 --> 16:54.082
Oh, come on, man.
Get that away from me.

16:54.185 --> 16:56.567
I told you, I had nothing to do
with Commander Davis's death.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.500
We have an eyewitness
who saw you arguing

16:58.603 --> 17:00.364
two days before the murder.

17:00.467 --> 17:02.021
That doesn't mean
that I killed him.

17:02.124 --> 17:03.470
Then what were you
arguing about?

17:05.438 --> 17:07.129
And why were you
selling me dirty laundry?

17:07.233 --> 17:08.441
I thought
that's what you wanted.

17:08.544 --> 17:10.339
I was talking about steroids.

17:10.443 --> 17:12.548
What steroids?

17:14.171 --> 17:15.482
I don't know
anything about those.

17:15.586 --> 17:17.519
Then why were
you and Davis arguing?

17:17.622 --> 17:19.521
Wh...

17:19.624 --> 17:24.112
And did I mention that we are
going to charge you with murder?

17:25.147 --> 17:26.562
Okay, Coach caught me sneaking

17:26.666 --> 17:29.565
into the locker room and...

17:29.669 --> 17:31.567
removing some property.

17:31.671 --> 17:33.535
You mean, women's sports bras?

17:33.638 --> 17:35.054
You sure you wouldn't,

17:35.157 --> 17:37.021
maybe, just rather
confess to murder?

17:37.125 --> 17:38.609
Okay, look, there's a
whole market out there

17:38.712 --> 17:43.855
for people who are really into,
like, unwashed... stuff.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.547
Why?

17:45.650 --> 17:47.135
I don't ask questions.
All right?

17:47.238 --> 17:48.377
I'm just an enlisted sailor
and an athlete

17:48.481 --> 17:50.207
trying to make ends meet, so...

17:50.310 --> 17:52.450
I sell the sweaty items
that the athletes leave behind.

17:52.554 --> 17:54.038
Right, but Davis caught you.

17:54.142 --> 17:55.212
And then you killed him.

17:55.315 --> 17:57.593
No. After we argued, all right,

17:57.697 --> 17:59.216
he said if I stopped selling,

17:59.319 --> 18:00.941
he wouldn't turn me over
to the master-at-arms.

18:01.045 --> 18:02.391
Commander Davis gave
me a second chance,

18:02.495 --> 18:03.565
all right,
and I took it.

18:03.668 --> 18:05.463
I closed up shop.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.155
Well, your trunk
looked open to me.

18:07.258 --> 18:08.639
Those were just
some leftovers.

18:08.742 --> 18:11.090
All right?
I do most of my sales online.

18:11.193 --> 18:13.092
But I shut all of that down.

18:14.576 --> 18:17.165
Jerseys, tank tops, socks.

18:17.268 --> 18:19.236
According to these listings,
they've all been worn

18:19.339 --> 18:22.963
by minor celebrities,
musicians or athletes.

18:23.067 --> 18:25.104
And in Kyle's case,
elite Navy athletes.

18:25.207 --> 18:27.106
According to his
transaction history,

18:27.209 --> 18:28.969
he made almost
a thousand dollars a month

18:29.073 --> 18:31.627
on these things he was
stealing from the locker room.

18:31.731 --> 18:33.974
We are in the wrong business.

18:34.078 --> 18:36.218
You think they have
a law enforcement section?

18:36.322 --> 18:38.393
What? You would really
sell your stuff?

18:38.496 --> 18:40.395
Not everything.

18:40.498 --> 18:42.397
I'm sure I have
a few things lying around.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.295
Wow, I'm really learning
a lot about you.

18:44.399 --> 18:45.676
- So am I.

18:45.779 --> 18:46.987
A little too much.

18:47.091 --> 18:49.369
Why don't we focus on the case?

18:49.473 --> 18:51.302
Is Kyle Seward
our killer or not?

18:51.406 --> 18:53.062
We don't think so.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.650
As of two days ago,
he closed his seller account.

18:54.754 --> 18:56.100
He was telling the truth.

18:56.204 --> 18:57.584
And we don't have
any hard evidence

18:57.688 --> 18:59.138
connecting him to the murder.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.485
So this was a wild-goose chase.

19:01.588 --> 19:02.934
Well, not exactly.

19:03.038 --> 19:04.384
See, when Kyle
closed his account,

19:04.488 --> 19:06.938
he left behind some, uh,
pretty angry customers.

19:07.042 --> 19:09.217
- How angry?
- Well, most of them

19:09.320 --> 19:10.597
were one-offs, but there
were definitely some that were

19:10.701 --> 19:12.358
a bit more obsessed.

19:12.461 --> 19:14.946
Meet NavyFan92.

19:15.050 --> 19:17.501
After Kyle announced
he was no longer in business,

19:17.604 --> 19:19.261
NavyFan92 started sending
hostile messages.

19:19.365 --> 19:21.229
- They threatened to break
into the locker room

19:21.332 --> 19:23.403
and steal the old
socks themselves.

19:23.507 --> 19:26.234
Maybe they followed through with
that threat and ran into Coach?

19:26.337 --> 19:28.374
NavyFan92 got a real name?

19:28.477 --> 19:29.444
Working on it.

19:29.547 --> 19:31.170
Then don't let me stop you.

19:34.552 --> 19:35.657
Torres.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.073
Hey. Is this a bad time?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.350
Felix?

19:39.454 --> 19:42.629
Uh, what's going on?
Are you okay?

19:42.733 --> 19:44.562
Y-Yeah.

19:44.666 --> 19:47.703
I was just thinking about Coach.

19:49.636 --> 19:51.604
Sounds like you're doing
more than thinking.

19:51.707 --> 19:53.122
Where are you?

19:54.262 --> 19:56.436
Have you cleared
Coach's name yet?

19:56.540 --> 19:58.611
We're working on it.

20:00.613 --> 20:02.546
What's taking so long?

20:02.649 --> 20:04.513
You don't focus on that.
You just tell me where you are

20:04.617 --> 20:06.170
and I'll come and pick you up.

20:09.553 --> 20:11.071
Hello?

20:17.802 --> 20:19.045
Hey, Kase.

20:19.148 --> 20:20.564
Is that one
of Parker's pastries?

20:20.667 --> 20:22.669
It sure is.

20:22.773 --> 20:24.568
I was wondering who all
was gonna go into that box.

20:24.671 --> 20:26.259
Nice of you to take pity.

20:26.363 --> 20:28.123
Oh, this is not a pity pastry.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.125
This is a motivation pastry.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.644
It'll be my reward

20:31.747 --> 20:34.129
after we figure out
who killed Commander Davis.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.510
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

20:35.613 --> 20:37.753
You find anything
to help us I.D. NavyFan92?

20:37.857 --> 20:39.893
Still working on it.
In the meantime,

20:39.997 --> 20:42.758
I ran the urine samples
for Felix and Kyle,

20:42.862 --> 20:44.139
but both came back negative.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.589
They weren't using.

20:45.692 --> 20:47.625
And we still don't know
where those PEDs came from.

20:47.729 --> 20:50.318
I wish I could help,
but testosterone, metenolone

20:50.421 --> 20:52.423
and methylprednisolone
are all easy to come by,

20:52.527 --> 20:55.633
which makes them
impossible to trace.
Mm.

20:55.737 --> 21:00.155
And the only other item in the
dopp kit was this old ribbon.

21:01.639 --> 21:03.262
"Outstanding
participation."

21:03.365 --> 21:04.746
I got one of these
in a Fourth of July sack race

21:04.849 --> 21:06.195
when I was nine.

21:06.299 --> 21:07.818
No way to tell
who it belongs to.

21:07.921 --> 21:09.785
And the only prints on it
were the commander's.

21:09.889 --> 21:11.615
I hope you like
stale kolaczki.

21:12.961 --> 21:15.653
- Maybe not so stale.
- You get a lead?

21:15.757 --> 21:16.827
Yeah.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.207
On NavyFan92.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.658
Still no name,
but I have an address.

21:20.762 --> 21:23.661
Seems our obsessed fan had
their purchases delivered

21:23.765 --> 21:25.836
to a mail forwarding service.

21:25.939 --> 21:28.528
Warrant come through
- on the shipping records?
- Uh-huh.

21:28.632 --> 21:32.843
The packages' final destination
was a warehouse in Anacostia.

21:32.946 --> 21:34.362
All right, send me the address.
Thanks, Kase.

21:34.465 --> 21:35.811
- Nice work.
- Uh-huh.

21:37.675 --> 21:39.574
Mmm.

21:40.713 --> 21:43.336
Anything?
Mm, no lights.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.958
No movement.

21:45.062 --> 21:48.721
Those doors are fully motorized
with biometric locks.

21:48.824 --> 21:50.792
Not to mention
I'm seeing security cameras

21:50.895 --> 21:52.345
about every ten feet.

21:52.449 --> 21:54.243
You know, this
place is a fortress.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.694
Oh, maybe
our obsessed sports fan

21:56.798 --> 21:59.490
is into something worse
than used jerseys.

22:00.940 --> 22:03.149
All right, well,
I guess we have first watch.

22:13.780 --> 22:17.266
So, you tap-dance, huh?

22:17.370 --> 22:18.647
Excuse me?

22:18.751 --> 22:20.891
Well, my earlier comments
about your "type"

22:20.994 --> 22:23.238
seemed to hit a nerve.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.654
Made me think that maybe
I should look at more

22:25.758 --> 22:27.207
than your NCIS file.

22:28.070 --> 22:30.210
So you found
my high school yearbook.

22:30.314 --> 22:33.628
Didn't realize you were
an all-state champion.

22:33.731 --> 22:35.837
Two-time all-state champion.

22:35.940 --> 22:38.529
You do contain multitudes,
Agent McGee.

22:40.773 --> 22:42.361
You look up Torres
and Knight, too?

22:42.464 --> 22:43.845
I'm working on it.

22:43.948 --> 22:45.985
Might be helpful to know
everybody's hidden talent.

22:46.088 --> 22:50.369
Never know when, uh...
when they'll come in handy.

22:54.027 --> 22:55.891
Looks like someone's home.

22:55.995 --> 22:57.583
Yep.

23:10.768 --> 23:13.357
Excuse us. NCIS.

23:16.671 --> 23:18.466
Hey, stop!

23:22.366 --> 23:23.471
- You okay?
- Yeah.

23:23.574 --> 23:26.405
Nice save.
You are light on your feet.

23:29.822 --> 23:31.513
Federal agents!

23:36.415 --> 23:37.657
The hell are we looking at?

23:37.761 --> 23:39.556
Nothing that makes me feel good.

23:42.973 --> 23:44.595
Don't come any closer!

23:44.699 --> 23:46.321
This lab is positively
pressurized

23:46.425 --> 23:48.979
with concentrated oxygen.

23:49.082 --> 23:52.914
One spark and we all go up
in flames.

24:02.475 --> 24:03.752
I'm serious.

24:03.856 --> 24:06.272
Back off.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.343
Take it easy. Easy.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.034
I, uh, I don't know
what's going on here,

24:10.138 --> 24:12.658
but I'm pretty sure
no one has to die.

24:12.761 --> 24:14.901
I would rather die
and destroy my work

24:15.005 --> 24:16.869
than give it to your bosses.

24:16.972 --> 24:19.285
Your work?

24:19.388 --> 24:20.804
Our bosses?

24:20.907 --> 24:22.461
Oh, don't play games.

24:22.564 --> 24:25.360
I have two advanced degrees
and a brain.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.536
You were sent
by the Chinese government.

24:31.918 --> 24:34.749
Credentials say "NCIS."

24:34.852 --> 24:37.476
And my fake I.D.
in high school said I was 35.

24:37.579 --> 24:38.960
You need to get
out of here.

24:39.063 --> 24:42.929
Otherwise my finger might slip.

24:43.033 --> 24:46.485
Look, I can see
that you're, uh...

24:46.588 --> 24:48.970
you're some kind
of a scientist.

24:49.073 --> 24:51.559
- And I can see you're not.
- Well, all
I'm saying is,

24:51.662 --> 24:54.458
instead of making, uh,
premature conclusions,

24:54.562 --> 24:55.908
you should do

24:56.011 --> 24:58.980
what scientists
research.

24:59.083 --> 25:00.671
What are you talking about?

25:00.775 --> 25:03.432
Look, a simple Internet
search would show

25:03.536 --> 25:05.331
that we are legit agents.

25:05.434 --> 25:07.644
I'm not stupid.

25:07.747 --> 25:08.921
Any mercenary
worth their salt

25:09.024 --> 25:10.854
would have a
backstopped identity.

25:10.957 --> 25:13.788
Yeah, that's very true,
but would a mercenary have

25:13.891 --> 25:18.482
a personal home page dedicated
to the Spotted Wood Thrush?

25:19.448 --> 25:21.347
What?

25:21.450 --> 25:23.867
You're a bird-watcher?

25:23.970 --> 25:25.834
Hidden talent.

25:27.491 --> 25:28.906
I'll give you one search.

25:29.010 --> 25:33.393
Okay. Just type in,
uh, "Alden Parker,

25:33.497 --> 25:34.981
bird man."

25:38.537 --> 25:39.986
Find it yet?

25:41.091 --> 25:43.472
Nothing is coming up.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.854
Type "Alden" with--
that's Alden with an "E."

25:45.958 --> 25:48.167
Yes, I got that,
but there's nothing here.

25:48.270 --> 25:50.652
Except a famous ornithologist
Theodore Parker,

25:50.756 --> 25:53.586
but it says here
he died 30 years ago.

25:55.899 --> 25:57.107
Oh, no.

25:57.210 --> 25:58.418
What did you do?

26:00.800 --> 26:02.077
Put it down, put it down.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.565
Please don't kill me.

26:15.021 --> 26:16.471
We've confirmed
that our warehouse scientist

26:16.575 --> 26:18.369
is NavyFan92.

26:18.473 --> 26:19.716
Got an I.D.?

26:19.819 --> 26:21.614
Her real name
is Dr. Astrid Fellowes.

26:21.718 --> 26:23.167
Started up her own biomedical
research company

26:23.271 --> 26:24.997
with Silicon Valley
seed money

26:25.100 --> 26:27.378
but whatever she's working on
is being kept under wraps.

26:27.482 --> 26:29.760
That explains the secret lab.

26:29.864 --> 26:31.451
She doesn't have
a criminal record,

26:31.555 --> 26:33.971
just a PhD in molecular biology.

26:34.075 --> 26:36.008
And a master's in paranoia.

26:39.287 --> 26:42.014
Okay. The whole
"Chinese mercenary" thing

26:42.117 --> 26:43.602
was a big misunderstanding.

26:43.705 --> 26:45.604
I'm just gonna apologize
for that and be on my way.

26:45.707 --> 26:47.744
Sit down.
There was no misunderstanding.

26:48.883 --> 26:50.643
Look familiar?

26:51.644 --> 26:53.473
Hmm.

26:53.577 --> 26:55.821
I've seen those.

26:55.924 --> 26:57.477
You bought those.

26:57.581 --> 26:58.755
A lot of them.

26:58.858 --> 27:00.757
Along with these
winning-game kneepads,

27:00.860 --> 27:02.655
and these running jerseys.

27:02.759 --> 27:04.726
All from the best Navy athletes.

27:04.830 --> 27:06.003
And you seemed pretty upset

27:06.107 --> 27:07.695
when your supply
suddenly got cut off.

27:07.798 --> 27:10.732
You threatened to break
into the locker room?

27:10.836 --> 27:13.183
So?

27:13.286 --> 27:14.978
So maybe you did.

27:15.081 --> 27:18.602
And Commander Davis caught you,
so you took care of him.

27:19.879 --> 27:21.640
Took care of him?

27:27.300 --> 27:29.440
Wait, is that
what this is all about?

27:29.544 --> 27:32.202
You think I actually
killed someone?

27:32.305 --> 27:34.135
Why not? You tried to kill me.

27:34.238 --> 27:36.206
No, that-that
was a mistake.

27:36.309 --> 27:39.485
I... I'm not a killer.

27:39.588 --> 27:40.762
Or an obsessed fan.

27:40.866 --> 27:42.661
I hate sports.

27:42.764 --> 27:44.766
So, all of this is...

27:44.870 --> 27:46.043
for a friend?

27:46.147 --> 27:49.529
They were for science.

27:50.358 --> 27:51.704
Weird science.

27:51.808 --> 27:53.810
I am a geneticist
studying DNA.

27:53.913 --> 27:56.571
I'm using elite athlete genomes
as a baseline,

27:56.675 --> 27:58.677
so, naturally, I need samples.

27:58.780 --> 28:00.955
Worn clothing has lots of DNA.

28:01.058 --> 28:04.027
Can't you join a medical
study or something?

28:04.130 --> 28:05.787
No, it is not
as easy as that.

28:05.891 --> 28:09.653
Genetic research involves
a lot of red tape, regulation,

28:09.757 --> 28:11.172
not to mention the cost.

28:11.275 --> 28:14.106
I found a cheaper shortcut.
Someone was already selling

28:14.209 --> 28:15.797
exactly what I needed.

28:15.901 --> 28:20.664
What exactly are you working on?

28:20.768 --> 28:22.977
Oh.

28:26.774 --> 28:29.638
You won't be working
on anything in prison.

28:31.606 --> 28:32.780
Fine.

28:35.783 --> 28:39.579
I'm working on a way
to detect genetic manipulation.

28:39.683 --> 28:41.098
Uh, that ship has sailed.

28:41.202 --> 28:44.550
We've been modifying crop genes
for decades now.

28:44.653 --> 28:47.070
I mean, in people.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.800
Go on.

28:52.903 --> 28:54.008
The same
gene-editing technology

28:54.111 --> 28:56.665
used to increase plant strength

28:56.769 --> 29:01.084
is now being used on humans,
to increase their strength.

29:01.187 --> 29:02.810
Gene doping.

29:02.913 --> 29:05.709
It's banned in sports and highly
regulated by governments,

29:05.813 --> 29:07.746
but the trouble is, there's
no way to reliably detect

29:07.849 --> 29:10.127
that it is even happening.

29:10.231 --> 29:12.751
U-Until now.

29:14.235 --> 29:17.928
I'm developing the first
universal CRISPR test.

29:18.032 --> 29:20.966
That's what you were willing
to blow us up for?

29:21.069 --> 29:24.003
It would be a scientific
breakthrough worth millions.

29:24.107 --> 29:26.281
And you think China
wants to steal it.

29:26.385 --> 29:28.628
I.P. theft
is their national pastime.

29:28.732 --> 29:31.597
They have been
after my research for years.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.944
I-I have to protect it.

29:34.048 --> 29:35.670
Well, it explains a lot.

29:35.774 --> 29:36.809
Thank you.

29:36.913 --> 29:38.777
Like why you'd be
willing to kill.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.055
I didn't kill anybody.

29:41.158 --> 29:42.573
You know, for a scientist,

29:42.677 --> 29:44.230
you're not giving us
a lot of proof.

29:44.334 --> 29:45.922
Well, I'm not handing
over my research,

29:46.025 --> 29:47.268
if that's what you're asking.

29:47.371 --> 29:50.685
We're asking for an alibi.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.964
Morning, Kasie.

29:54.068 --> 29:55.138
Hey, Nick.

29:55.241 --> 29:56.656
I thought McGee was coming, too.

29:56.760 --> 30:00.039
Yeah, he, uh, had
to take the elevator.

30:01.938 --> 30:03.767
Hey, Kase.

30:03.871 --> 30:05.251
- What you got?
- What do <i>you</i> got?

30:05.355 --> 30:06.874
I mean, besides a new pimp walk.

30:06.977 --> 30:10.015
I got a hairline fracture
on my fifth metatarsal.

30:10.118 --> 30:12.120
Killing me all night.
I had Jimmy take an X-ray.

30:12.224 --> 30:14.329
Oh. You want something
for the pain?

30:14.433 --> 30:17.298
I got a nighttime cold-and-flu
tablet if you want to feel good.

30:17.401 --> 30:19.887
I appreciate it,
but no, I'd rather

30:19.990 --> 30:21.267
just hear about
our paranoid geneticist.

30:21.371 --> 30:22.959
Well, I got
plenty of that.

30:23.062 --> 30:24.961
As soon as Fellowes
realized her choice

30:25.064 --> 30:26.825
was between an alibi
or the big house,

30:26.928 --> 30:29.310
she gave us access
to her entire research lab.

30:29.413 --> 30:30.932
So, was she telling us
the truth?

30:31.036 --> 30:32.313
Mostly.

30:32.416 --> 30:34.142
I can't say
whether foreign governments

30:34.246 --> 30:36.006
were coming after her,
but she <i>was</i> studying

30:36.110 --> 30:38.837
the DNA of elite Navy athletes.

30:38.940 --> 30:40.148
The science is real.

30:40.252 --> 30:42.116
What about her alibi?
Was that real?

30:42.219 --> 30:43.876
Unfortunately, Fellowes was

30:43.980 --> 30:47.086
in her research lab
at the time of the murder.

30:47.190 --> 30:49.088
So, not our killer.

30:49.192 --> 30:50.400
Uh, a dead end.

30:50.503 --> 30:52.436
So much for sweet rewards.

30:54.300 --> 30:57.510
Torres. Wait, what?

31:00.375 --> 31:02.136
NCIS.

31:02.239 --> 31:04.138
Great.

31:04.241 --> 31:05.449
You can remove the cuffs.

31:05.553 --> 31:08.004
I think they've cooled down
enough.

31:09.039 --> 31:11.007
So, who wants to go first?

31:11.110 --> 31:12.940
Okay, I was just coming out here
to clear my head

31:13.043 --> 31:14.424
and get some cardio,
the next thing I know,

31:14.527 --> 31:15.425
he's all in my face
trying to start something.

31:15.528 --> 31:17.737
I did start something.

31:17.841 --> 31:19.325
Finished it, too.

31:19.429 --> 31:21.983
Why?
He fought with Coach,
so I fought with him.

31:22.087 --> 31:23.502
Okay, I told you I had nothing
to do with what happened to him!

31:23.605 --> 31:25.124
- Yo, man, get out of my face.
- Okay, okay.

31:25.228 --> 31:27.816
Hey! Hey!
That's enough, from both of you!

31:27.920 --> 31:30.267
He's lucky I don't
- press charges, man!
- Stand down.

31:30.371 --> 31:32.131
What's the matter with you?

31:32.235 --> 31:34.099
You told me
to channel my emotions.

31:34.202 --> 31:35.203
Into running.

31:35.307 --> 31:37.136
Why do you even care what I do?

31:40.036 --> 31:41.830
Because I've been
where you are, man,

31:41.934 --> 31:44.937
and I know how hard it is
to ask for help.

31:45.041 --> 31:47.353
I don't want your help.

31:47.457 --> 31:50.943
I want you
to clear Coach's name.

31:51.047 --> 31:52.358
I need to know he was the man
I thought he was,

31:52.462 --> 31:53.877
because if I was wrong
about him,

31:53.981 --> 31:55.223
then maybe he was wrong
about me.

31:55.327 --> 31:56.397
Maybe I don't deserve
to be out here.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.157
Maybe I don't belong out here.

31:58.261 --> 32:00.470
Don't say that, okay?
Don't-don't go there.

32:00.573 --> 32:01.920
You got talent.

32:02.023 --> 32:05.406
Doesn't matter. I'm done.

32:05.509 --> 32:08.305
Done with-with you,
with Coach, with all of it.

32:08.409 --> 32:10.790
- I quit. I quit!
- Come here. Come here.

32:26.565 --> 32:28.325
You want to talk?

32:28.429 --> 32:30.431
About?
Felix.

32:32.674 --> 32:34.849
He is gonna come around,
you know.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.920
Why do you say that?

32:37.024 --> 32:39.095
Well, because you're
a good coach.

32:39.198 --> 32:41.028
Said who?
Me.

32:42.029 --> 32:43.927
And Parker.

32:44.031 --> 32:47.206
He, uh, seems to think
it's your hidden talent.

32:48.242 --> 32:49.243
My what?

32:53.523 --> 32:55.421
Have you seen Parker recently?

32:55.525 --> 32:56.560
McGee has.

32:56.664 --> 32:58.183
Yeah, about an hour ago. Why?

32:58.286 --> 32:59.839
Well, he hasn't been
at his desk in a while,

32:59.943 --> 33:01.013
so I'm thinking
he's about to walk in here

33:01.117 --> 33:03.050
at any minute
looking for answers.

33:03.153 --> 33:04.430
Well, we don't have any.

33:04.534 --> 33:06.432
We still don't know
where the PEDs came from

33:06.536 --> 33:08.883
and the scientist's alibi
checked out.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.367
No suspects, no leads.

33:10.471 --> 33:12.542
Which is not what
a team leader like to hear.

33:12.645 --> 33:14.544
Even the, uh,
type of team leader

33:14.647 --> 33:16.925
that makes small talk
and offers pastries?

33:17.029 --> 33:18.099
I contain multitudes,

33:18.203 --> 33:19.342
Agent McGee.

33:19.445 --> 33:21.551
Pastry, anyone?

33:21.654 --> 33:24.485
Nobody seemed to like
the, uh, kolaczkis,

33:24.588 --> 33:27.108
so today, we have concha
from the best Mexican bakery

33:27.212 --> 33:30.180
in D.C.,
which is in a gas station.

33:31.250 --> 33:32.182
It's not a bribe,

33:32.286 --> 33:33.597
or a test.

33:33.701 --> 33:37.118
It's just a...
a hidden talent.

33:37.222 --> 33:39.155
I can find the best
international pastry

33:39.258 --> 33:40.432
in any town.

33:41.502 --> 33:43.262
That's your hidden talent?

33:43.366 --> 33:45.299
I didn't say
it had to be useful.

33:46.576 --> 33:48.302
Would you rather
I only come in here

33:48.405 --> 33:50.269
to get upset and bark orders?

33:50.373 --> 33:51.995
A little.

33:52.099 --> 33:53.997
It's what we're used to.

33:54.101 --> 33:56.620
And I get that,
but that's not who I am,

33:56.724 --> 33:59.313
so let's work with what we got.

33:59.416 --> 34:01.349
Except we've got nothing.

34:01.453 --> 34:02.523
Case is at a dead end.

34:02.626 --> 34:04.076
So we fix that.

34:04.180 --> 34:05.353
Let's take a breath,

34:05.457 --> 34:07.355
take a concha

34:07.459 --> 34:08.977
and start
from the beginning.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.049
Who wants to go first?

34:11.152 --> 34:12.326
I will.

34:12.429 --> 34:13.396
Ooh, I may not have found
our killer,

34:13.499 --> 34:15.536
but I earned this.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.158
Mmm.

34:17.262 --> 34:19.678
Mm. I have a lead.

34:19.781 --> 34:21.438
So we're trying to figure out

34:21.542 --> 34:23.302
who was using the
PEDs, right?

34:23.406 --> 34:26.202
But the only way to
figure out who was doping

34:26.305 --> 34:28.411
would be to test
every Navy athlete.

34:28.514 --> 34:30.275
Yeah, that's a whole lot
of samples to collect.

34:30.378 --> 34:32.622
Then I realized we don't
have to collect anything.

34:32.725 --> 34:35.487
We already have
everything we need.

34:35.590 --> 34:36.936
Hmm.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.524
Fellowes's DNA research.

34:38.628 --> 34:41.148
Our paranoid geneticist
was analyzing

34:41.251 --> 34:42.666
shed skin cells.

34:42.770 --> 34:45.048
That means she already
tested every Navy athlete

34:45.152 --> 34:48.258
that's been through that locker
room in the last two years.

34:48.362 --> 34:49.432
We should send her
a thank-you card.

34:49.535 --> 34:50.571
It's already in the mail.

34:50.674 --> 34:52.124
Because I was able to look

34:52.228 --> 34:54.161
through her reports
for signs of doping.

34:54.264 --> 34:55.438
- You found some.
- Yes.

34:55.541 --> 34:57.233
One. So I ran the sample

34:57.336 --> 35:00.132
through the military
database and got a hit.

35:00.236 --> 35:03.377
The only athlete
to show signs of PED use

35:03.480 --> 35:06.518
was Petty Officer
Jamie Anderson.

35:06.621 --> 35:09.348
The runner who was killed
in a car accident last year.

35:09.452 --> 35:11.937
Well, before then, Jamie
was using testosterone,

35:12.040 --> 35:14.353
metenolone and methylprednisolone.

35:14.457 --> 35:17.322
The same drugs we found
in Coach Davis's office.

35:17.425 --> 35:19.462
We now have hard evidence

35:19.565 --> 35:20.739
that one of his athletes
was cheating.

35:20.842 --> 35:22.706
This doesn't look
good for Coach.

35:22.810 --> 35:24.432
- Oh, and the Navy's
gonna be pretty pissed

35:24.536 --> 35:25.675
when they find out.

35:25.778 --> 35:27.642
Yeah, not to mention
Jamie's parents.

35:27.746 --> 35:31.025
Or maybe they already knew.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.716
Parker, you got something?

35:33.786 --> 35:35.098
Hey, I recognize that look.

35:35.202 --> 35:36.272
That's the same look

35:36.375 --> 35:38.653
Gibbs used to get when...

35:38.757 --> 35:41.000
he figured out something.

35:41.104 --> 35:43.037
Well, I guess
some things never change.

35:48.111 --> 35:50.182
Your son had talent.

35:51.287 --> 35:54.186
Jamie still holds
the Navy record

35:54.290 --> 35:56.050
for two events, right?

35:56.844 --> 35:58.397
Yeah, he left a legacy.

36:00.261 --> 36:02.677
Thanks, uh, for meeting me here
on short notice.

36:02.781 --> 36:05.197
But like I said on the phone,

36:05.301 --> 36:07.717
I think we found something
that belongs to you.

36:11.617 --> 36:13.447
Sorry. I don't
recognize this.

36:14.482 --> 36:16.277
Hmm, that's odd.

36:16.381 --> 36:18.210
I thought it was Jamie's
for sure.

36:18.314 --> 36:21.696
I mean, uh, we found it
in the same bag as his drugs.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.698
Excuse me?

36:25.252 --> 36:27.012
Jamie was doping.

36:27.115 --> 36:30.567
Must be some mistake.

36:30.671 --> 36:33.536
Like I said before,
Jamie would never do that.

36:33.639 --> 36:36.297
Well, you also said that you
didn't recognize this ribbon.

36:36.401 --> 36:37.471
That's two lies.

36:37.574 --> 36:38.817
I'm not lying.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.267
I've never seen that
before in my life.

36:40.370 --> 36:42.234
That's not what your wife said.

36:43.339 --> 36:44.650
We have agents
with her right now,

36:44.754 --> 36:47.722
and she showed them
another picture of your son.

36:51.416 --> 36:54.073
She said Jamie won this
in his first race ever,

36:54.177 --> 36:55.627
and always kept it
for good luck.

36:55.730 --> 37:00.114
That... seems like something
a father should know.

37:02.185 --> 37:04.049
How dare you talk
about my son like this?

37:04.152 --> 37:06.327
I'm talking about you now.

37:07.397 --> 37:09.641
You found out
Jamie was doping,

37:09.744 --> 37:11.159
and you blamed Coach Davis.

37:11.263 --> 37:12.091
No.

37:12.195 --> 37:13.507
He was a trusted mentor,

37:13.610 --> 37:14.542
a father figure.

37:14.646 --> 37:16.164
But instead
of helping Jamie

37:16.268 --> 37:18.236
realize his
potential, he...

37:19.789 --> 37:22.412
...he was addicting him
to drugs. That's...

37:24.690 --> 37:26.554
...that's why you killed him.

37:28.556 --> 37:30.455
Hey. Look.

37:30.558 --> 37:33.837
It's a parent's duty
to protect their child.

37:33.941 --> 37:35.322
Right?

37:36.323 --> 37:38.394
Yeah.

37:40.396 --> 37:43.191
Yeah, but I didn't.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.332
I didn't protect him.

37:45.435 --> 37:49.267
Coach didn't give
Jamie the drugs.

37:50.854 --> 37:52.408
I did.

37:53.478 --> 37:55.790
You doped your own son?

37:57.999 --> 38:00.933
So Coach was the one
who found out?

38:01.037 --> 38:04.834
A maintenance crew
found Jamie's bag

38:04.937 --> 38:08.734
stuck behind an old locker
a few days ago.

38:08.838 --> 38:12.117
Coach saw the ribbon
and the steroids,

38:12.220 --> 38:14.430
and he put it together.

38:14.533 --> 38:16.397
Realized what I was
making Jamie do.

38:16.501 --> 38:18.434
That's why he called you
that day.

38:18.537 --> 38:21.713
Said he was gonna report
the PED use, that...

38:21.816 --> 38:24.543
it was only fair to
inform the other athletes

38:24.647 --> 38:26.338
who competed against Jamie.

38:27.374 --> 38:30.204
Coach was gonna let them
take away

38:30.308 --> 38:32.620
all I have left of my son.

38:32.724 --> 38:35.727
So I showed up early
to the locker room

38:35.830 --> 38:39.213
and I begged him, I begged
him to keep quiet.

38:39.317 --> 38:43.666
And when he still refused,
I pulled out the gun.

38:43.769 --> 38:45.461
And I threatened him.

38:46.772 --> 38:49.948
It was loaded with blanks.

38:51.674 --> 38:55.402
I only wanted
to scare Coach,

38:55.505 --> 38:57.438
but things got
heated and...

38:57.542 --> 39:00.855
I swear to you,
I did not mean to kill him.

39:06.378 --> 39:09.312
I thought sports stories
were supposed to be uplifting.

39:09.416 --> 39:11.314
Well, apparently, not this one.

39:11.418 --> 39:13.247
A promising young athlete
pushed to cheat

39:13.351 --> 39:16.768
by an overbearing parent,
a beloved coach dead.

39:16.871 --> 39:18.632
Yeah, and my foot is broken.

39:19.702 --> 39:21.773
How is that sports-related?

39:21.876 --> 39:23.775
Well, I may never
tap-dance again.

39:23.878 --> 39:25.432
You said it was
a hairline fracture.

39:25.535 --> 39:26.847
You'll be fine by the weekend.

39:26.950 --> 39:29.367
Yeah, well,
it's still gonna hurt.

39:30.920 --> 39:32.853
That was Felix's CO.

39:32.956 --> 39:36.477
The kid is being busted
down a rank for fighting.

39:36.581 --> 39:37.892
That's harsh.
How'd he handle it?

39:37.996 --> 39:40.447
I'm worried about him.

39:40.550 --> 39:42.345
Then we still got work to do.

39:42.449 --> 39:44.347
- Is this the part
of the sports movie

39:44.451 --> 39:45.797
where the coach
gives the rousing speech

39:45.900 --> 39:47.557
to rally the team?

39:47.661 --> 39:49.766
I'm not one for speeches,

39:49.870 --> 39:52.976
but I do have another idea
to keep everybody in the game.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.462
Does it involve baked goods?

39:55.565 --> 39:58.741
It involves you, Agent Torres.

40:02.848 --> 40:05.023
Thank you for coming.

40:05.126 --> 40:06.852
What are we doing here?

40:06.956 --> 40:09.303
Well, I wanted to let you know
that, uh,

40:09.407 --> 40:11.478
we cleared
Commander Davis's name.

40:11.581 --> 40:14.308
I heard. Thanks, I guess.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.034
You were right about him.

40:16.137 --> 40:17.967
He's still gone.

40:18.070 --> 40:19.762
And you're
still here.

40:22.523 --> 40:24.732
Right where you belong.

40:24.836 --> 40:26.493
Nah, I can't race without Coach.

40:26.596 --> 40:27.977
Well, he believed in you.

40:28.080 --> 40:30.566
Not many people do.

40:30.669 --> 40:32.740
That's where you're wrong.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.751
Wait, What's going on?
What are they doing here?

40:43.855 --> 40:45.857
Well, they're here
to watch a race.

40:45.960 --> 40:49.412
You and me, right
here, right now.

40:49.516 --> 40:50.689
Are you being serious?

40:50.793 --> 40:52.346
Oh, yeah.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.865
You know you'd lose, right?

40:53.968 --> 40:55.522
Oh, for sure.

40:55.625 --> 40:58.663
But win or lose,
you got to finish strong, baby.

41:00.906 --> 41:02.736
Coach could be cheesy.

41:02.839 --> 41:04.669
You're on.

41:04.772 --> 41:07.603
Sure you don't want to join
them? Give them a few pointers?

41:07.706 --> 41:09.397
Maybe next time.

41:09.501 --> 41:11.054
What am I missing?

41:11.158 --> 41:14.023
Agent Knight here was a college
track star. Division I.

41:14.126 --> 41:16.957
Really? You never told us,
this whole time.

41:17.060 --> 41:20.443
Humility is one
of my hidden talents.

41:20.547 --> 41:21.893
All right, I need someone

41:21.996 --> 41:23.515
to count us off.

41:23.619 --> 41:25.897
You want the honors, McGee?

41:26.898 --> 41:28.071
Nah. You go.

41:30.660 --> 41:31.730
All right.

41:31.834 --> 41:35.493
On your mark, get set...

41:35.596 --> 41:36.839
go!
