00:01.667 --> 00:03.458
[instrumental music]

00:03.542 --> 00:05.375
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

00:05.458 --> 00:07.167
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

00:07.250 --> 00:10.167
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.083
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

00:12.167 --> 00:14.458
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.042
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

00:16.125 --> 00:17.750
(Delenn)
And a year of joy.

00:17.833 --> 00:19.333
(Mollari)
It was a new age.

00:19.417 --> 00:21.292
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

00:21.375 --> 00:24.458
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

00:26.708 --> 00:30.750
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261, the place..

00:30.833 --> 00:32.792
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

00:32.875 --> 00:35.917
[theme music]

01:05.667 --> 01:08.708
[music continues]

01:30.042 --> 01:33.042
[instrumental music]

01:33.625 --> 01:34.875
[beeping]

01:34.958 --> 01:37.958
[automated message]
'Good morning, the time is 0530'

01:38.042 --> 01:39.833
'Earth standard time.'

01:39.917 --> 01:42.167
'You have
the following messages.'

01:42.250 --> 01:44.792
'Message from
Ambassador Delenn.'

01:44.875 --> 01:47.292
'Message from Vir Cotto.'

01:47.375 --> 01:50.000
'Message from station security.'

01:50.083 --> 01:52.542
'Message from Docker's Guild.'

01:52.625 --> 01:55.917
'Message from Citizen G'Kar.'

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
'You have
the following meetings.'

01:58.083 --> 01:59.625
'0700'

01:59.708 --> 02:01.875
'strategic planning committee.'

02:01.958 --> 02:04.042

02:04.125 --> 02:06.917
'Babylon Treaty
oversight meeting.'

02:07.000 --> 02:11.125
'0830,
league of non-aligned worlds.'

02:11.208 --> 02:12.750
'0950..'

02:12.833 --> 02:15.875
We have already discussed this!

02:15.958 --> 02:18.208
Yes, but we haven't
finished discussing it.

02:18.292 --> 02:20.458
And when are we to be finished?

02:20.542 --> 02:22.875
As soon as you agree
to my proposal.

02:22.958 --> 02:24.458
I told you this
a half an hour ago.

02:24.542 --> 02:26.458
Look, if you're having
problem with comprehension

02:26.542 --> 02:28.708
perhaps you should borrow
the Gaim's translator.

02:28.792 --> 02:31.375
[indistinct chatter]

02:31.458 --> 02:33.042
Please. Please!

02:33.125 --> 02:35.917
The issues before us
are extremely important.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.042
Each of your governments
signed the Babylon Treaty

02:38.125 --> 02:39.708
'promising to keep ships here'

02:39.792 --> 02:42.542
as part of the ongoing
defense of Babylon 5.

02:42.625 --> 02:45.208
The treaty also stipulated
that all of us

02:45.292 --> 02:48.667
would work together
as a unit against the Shadows.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.208
Why then have
your governments recalled

02:50.292 --> 02:51.458
nearly all of your ships?

02:51.542 --> 02:54.083
- The war is over.
- 'It isn't over!

02:54.167 --> 02:56.583
There's a pause, yes,
but that's all.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.208
They'll regroup soon and then--

02:58.292 --> 03:00.042
All the more reason
to take advantage

03:00.125 --> 03:02.750
of a lull in combat
to address our wounds

03:02.833 --> 03:05.708
to tighten defenses
around our home worlds.

03:05.792 --> 03:07.250
By pulling our forces apart

03:07.333 --> 03:09.833
you're destroying the only
chance we have of winning!

03:09.917 --> 03:12.750
You cannot win this war,
commander

03:12.833 --> 03:14.417
you can only survive it!

03:14.500 --> 03:16.458
And we intend to survive it.

03:16.542 --> 03:19.250
- If the rumors are true--
- They may not be.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.625
We don't know
what happened at Z'ha'dum.

03:21.708 --> 03:24.125
There've been reports
of a thermonuclear detonation

03:24.208 --> 03:25.417
but that's all.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.708
Look, if they've been hurt

03:26.792 --> 03:28.042
then we have
to press the advantage

03:28.125 --> 03:29.417
and hit them as hard as we can!

03:29.500 --> 03:31.875
You cannot attack Z'ha'dum!

03:31.958 --> 03:34.417
Yes, we can!
The captain showed us how.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.292
- He--
- Captain Sheridan is dead.

03:37.375 --> 03:39.292
You don't know that.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.625
No one returns from Z'ha'dum.

03:41.708 --> 03:44.292
If we go, we will not return.

03:44.375 --> 03:48.208
That is real reason
you wish us to go to Z'ha'dum.

03:48.292 --> 03:50.250
You wish to find your captain.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.083
'You wish him to be alive.'

03:52.167 --> 03:55.208
If we go, we will be
buried alongside him.

03:55.292 --> 03:57.458
Our task is to serve our people.

03:57.542 --> 03:59.458
This must come first.

03:59.542 --> 04:01.833
Just a minute,
this meeting is not over.

04:01.917 --> 04:04.250
- I said--
- Let them go, commander.

04:04.333 --> 04:07.750
Sheridan was willing to risk
his life for their benefit.

04:07.833 --> 04:11.000
They're afraid to act
as honorably as he did.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.875
The shame is theirs.

04:12.958 --> 04:15.208
I'm sorry, commander.

04:20.583 --> 04:23.208
He did not come. Again.

04:23.292 --> 04:24.667
Yes.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.417
And I intend to find out why.

04:29.792 --> 04:32.833
[intense music]

04:34.292 --> 04:36.292
You should be most pleased.

04:36.375 --> 04:39.083
Emperor Cartagia
does not often grant

04:39.167 --> 04:40.417
a private audience

04:40.500 --> 04:43.500
but he has been
most pleased by your work

04:43.583 --> 04:46.542
and wanted to personally
welcome you

04:46.625 --> 04:48.833
to the royal court.

04:48.917 --> 04:51.875
Oh, it is a most great honor!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.917
- Yes.
- Oh, most great!

04:54.000 --> 04:56.333
Minister, I have met Cartagia

04:56.417 --> 04:58.167
three times before.

04:58.250 --> 04:59.667
Twice when he was an infant.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.792
He drooled most of the time.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.792
I wonder if he has
continued the habit.

05:03.875 --> 05:07.208
And again when he was 15,
trying to peek up the dresses

05:07.292 --> 05:08.750
of some young women.

05:08.833 --> 05:12.292
I promise you, I will be
just as impressed by him now

05:12.375 --> 05:14.833
as I was then. Yes?

05:20.958 --> 05:23.583
Ah, Mollari.
It's wonderful to see you again.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.083
And you, Majesty.

05:25.167 --> 05:26.625
I could swear
you have not changed

05:26.708 --> 05:28.667
since the last few
times I saw you.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.958
(Cartagia)
'Ah, you are,
of course, too generous.'

05:32.875 --> 05:34.625
So what do you think, Mollari?

05:34.708 --> 05:37.583
(Mollari)
'It is, uh..'

05:37.667 --> 05:39.458
...uh..

05:39.542 --> 05:41.833
...short, Majesty.

05:41.917 --> 05:44.583
Shorter than is traditional
for someone of your position.

05:44.667 --> 05:47.708
Yes, yes.
Decadent, isn't it?

05:49.458 --> 05:51.250
I find the shorter crest

05:51.333 --> 05:54.292
allows me to leave the palace,
walk in places

05:54.375 --> 05:56.000
where the nobility
would never think

05:56.083 --> 05:58.250
of being seen for the scandal.

05:58.333 --> 06:01.375
The things I have seen.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.667
As you can see,
I've started quite the trend.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.083
'It's become all the fashion
among the court.'

06:06.167 --> 06:08.875
Hmm, I suppose there are
those that might object

06:08.958 --> 06:10.292
but they remain silent

06:10.375 --> 06:13.667
because the emperor's
always right.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.208
Is he not, Mollari?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.792
That is our tradition.

06:18.917 --> 06:20.458
Mm.

06:20.542 --> 06:22.458
I've called you home
for two reasons, Mollari.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.958
First, you have
a great deal of experience

06:25.042 --> 06:26.875
with these off-worlders.

06:26.958 --> 06:28.375
I have need of that.

06:28.458 --> 06:31.792
Centauri Prime has become
provincial, small-minded.

06:31.875 --> 06:33.625
'They don't see the.. Oh..'

06:33.708 --> 06:36.292
What was it that that-that,
that charming human called it

06:36.375 --> 06:37.458
a few weeks ago?

06:37.542 --> 06:40.292
Oh-oh. T-the big picture.

06:40.375 --> 06:41.500
The, the big picture!

06:41.583 --> 06:42.750
They don't see the big picture

06:42.833 --> 06:45.792
but you and I see
the big picture.

06:45.875 --> 06:48.125
Don't we, Mollari?

06:48.208 --> 06:51.083
We will change
our world forever.

06:51.167 --> 06:53.458
You will handle
the arrangements.

06:54.542 --> 06:56.417
What arrangements?

06:56.500 --> 06:59.500
Oh, well, that will
be explained to you

06:59.583 --> 07:00.833
later this evening.

07:00.917 --> 07:03.417
You're doubtless tired
from your long journey.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.000
Go. Go and rest.

07:06.083 --> 07:08.583
We'll speak again after.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.667
Um, Majesty..

07:13.875 --> 07:15.708
You said there were two reasons?

07:15.792 --> 07:18.125
Ah, yes!

07:18.208 --> 07:21.167
You were...requested.

07:21.250 --> 07:24.292
- By whom?
- You'll see.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.292
[intense music]

07:32.417 --> 07:33.917
I got your message, Vir,
I don't have a lot of time--

07:34.000 --> 07:36.167
I know what happened
to Captain Sheridan.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.125
How?

07:37.208 --> 07:38.833
Londo has sources

07:38.917 --> 07:40.042
close to the Shadows.

07:40.125 --> 07:41.208
When he's not here, they leave

07:41.292 --> 07:43.250
their information with me.

07:43.333 --> 07:46.167
'Sheridan was taken
to the largest underground city'

07:46.250 --> 07:47.875
in Z'ha'dum.

07:47.958 --> 07:50.042
Their capital, you might say.

07:50.125 --> 07:52.708
While he was there, he sent
a message to the White Star

07:52.792 --> 07:56.208
which caused it
to crash into their city..

07:57.125 --> 08:00.000
...carrying two 500 megaton

08:00.083 --> 08:02.875
thermonuclear devices
which exploded on impact.

08:02.958 --> 08:05.083
And the captain?

08:05.167 --> 08:07.875
[inhales deeply]
He was seen falling
into a great chasm

08:07.958 --> 08:10.292
moments before the blast.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.750
It's a two-mile drop.

08:13.958 --> 08:16.292
It appears the rumors are true.

08:17.458 --> 08:19.792
Captain Sheridan is dead.

08:23.333 --> 08:26.000
But he took
their biggest city with him..

08:27.167 --> 08:30.625
...putting them
into complete chaos..

08:30.708 --> 08:34.167
...causing them
to regroup and retreat.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.750
I-I suppose, with any luck,
we won't see

08:38.833 --> 08:41.833
Mr. Morden's face
around here anymore.

08:43.542 --> 08:45.583
That's good.

08:46.833 --> 08:49.917
[music continues]

09:03.667 --> 09:05.625
(Morden)
'Hello, Mollari.'

09:18.167 --> 09:20.250
Mr. Morden?

09:20.333 --> 09:22.333
In the flesh.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.375
What's left of it.

09:26.250 --> 09:27.792
Sit.

09:27.875 --> 09:30.375
We have much to discuss.

09:34.917 --> 09:36.833
Mr. Morden, you are--

09:36.917 --> 09:39.208
Unwell.

09:39.292 --> 09:42.958
My associates tell me
I'll be better soon.

09:43.042 --> 09:46.625
I wasn't as near
the incident as others.

09:47.792 --> 09:50.750
- And Sheridan?
- 'Which one?'

09:52.958 --> 09:55.125
You know what they say.

09:56.125 --> 09:57.667
What goes up..

09:57.750 --> 10:00.583
...must come down.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.792
Seen one Sheridan,
seen them all.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.333
Ashes, ashes..

10:06.417 --> 10:09.042
...we all fall down.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.292
Shouldn't you be someplace
where they can take care of you?

10:14.375 --> 10:15.542
Your injuries?

10:15.625 --> 10:17.833
Flesh is transitory,
flesh is a prison

10:17.917 --> 10:20.500
flesh is..

10:20.583 --> 10:22.750
...an instrument.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.125
'Flesh can be replaced.'

10:27.167 --> 10:30.167
And flesh does as it's told.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.083
Or they will become..

10:34.708 --> 10:37.083
...most annoyed.

10:38.208 --> 10:39.750
What are you doing here?

10:39.833 --> 10:43.375
Cartagia told you to expect
a visitor, did he not?

10:43.458 --> 10:46.458
- He meant you?
- What's left of me.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.417
I'm just a..

10:49.500 --> 10:52.042
...shadow of my former self.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.250
[chuckling]

10:54.333 --> 10:57.125
The incident at Z'ha'dum

10:57.208 --> 11:00.750
has forced us to look
for outside support

11:00.833 --> 11:03.083
'sooner than we had intended.'

11:05.875 --> 11:07.375
My associates

11:07.458 --> 11:09.750
are planning to move
some of their forces

11:09.833 --> 11:12.083
off Z'ha'dum..

11:12.167 --> 11:15.458
...to ensure their safety.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.042
In case certain parties decide

11:17.125 --> 11:20.083
'to take advantage
of the situation.'

11:21.708 --> 11:23.708
They did it before.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.750
A thousand years ago.

11:27.667 --> 11:30.375
Planted their ships like seeds

11:30.458 --> 11:33.042
all around the galaxy.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.375
In exchange for certain favors.

11:36.458 --> 11:39.208
Emperor Cartagia has agreed to..

11:39.292 --> 11:41.583
...loan us a small..

11:41.667 --> 11:44.417
...piece...of Centauri Prime.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.917
No, he wouldn't.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.125
He couldn't.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.042
The Centaurum
wouldn't stand for it.

11:50.125 --> 11:51.875
The resolution
was passed quietly.

11:51.958 --> 11:53.958
Fourteen opposed it.

11:55.042 --> 11:56.833
No one's seen them since.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.167
He's mad.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.125
If there's a madman
on the throne

12:00.208 --> 12:03.000
it's because you
and Refa put him there.

12:04.417 --> 12:06.917
He's your responsibility,
and you..

12:09.458 --> 12:12.458
...you are mine.

12:12.542 --> 12:15.500
Based on our warm relations
of the past

12:15.583 --> 12:18.708
my associates asked for you..

12:18.792 --> 12:22.000
...as our liaison
to the royal court.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.750
I don't care.

12:27.167 --> 12:29.125
I won't do it.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.708
Of course, you will, Mollari.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.083
Because you're drawn to power.

12:36.917 --> 12:40.208
Because you're my friend.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.958
Because you're afraid
of what someone else

12:42.042 --> 12:44.417
might do in your place.

12:47.083 --> 12:50.167
My associates will
be arriving soon.

12:54.958 --> 12:57.458
Make sure everything is ready.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.792
[instrumental music]

13:17.792 --> 13:19.333
I'm sorry we're late.

13:19.417 --> 13:21.542
The ambassador was in discussion
with the Vorlon Homeworld

13:21.625 --> 13:23.000
until late last night.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.583
About what?

13:24.667 --> 13:26.875
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that.

13:26.958 --> 13:29.375
After all I've done for you..

13:29.458 --> 13:32.042
...am I now to be
shut out like this?

13:32.125 --> 13:34.542
Was there anything in particular
that you wanted, ambassador?

13:34.625 --> 13:36.208
Otherwise..

13:36.292 --> 13:39.542
I need to speak with you.
Alone.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.208
I'm afraid that's not possible.

13:42.292 --> 13:44.708
I don't have any choice
in this either, Delenn.

13:44.792 --> 13:48.375
The league is breaking up again
returning to their own worlds.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.875
The alliance is fracturing.

13:49.958 --> 13:52.417
One word from you,
from the Vorlon empire

13:52.500 --> 13:55.125
could help keep it all together.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.417
But you haven't come
to our council meetings

13:57.500 --> 14:00.708
haven't returned my calls. Why?

14:03.708 --> 14:05.333
The stories we have heard

14:05.417 --> 14:07.500
about what happened
at Z'ha'dum..

14:08.208 --> 14:10.292
...are they true?

14:11.917 --> 14:13.250
Yes.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.000
And what do you intend
to do about them?

14:17.333 --> 14:19.000
Nothing.

14:21.500 --> 14:25.042
But if Sheridan is still alive,
if there's even a chance..

14:26.375 --> 14:28.333
Irrelevant.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.333
Irrelevant?

14:31.417 --> 14:33.292
How can you say that?

14:33.375 --> 14:36.167
You know how much
depends on him.

14:37.458 --> 14:40.625
He has opened
an unexpected door.

14:41.542 --> 14:44.958
We do now what must be done now.

14:46.042 --> 14:49.125
His purpose has been fulfilled.

14:49.208 --> 14:52.458
You have the power to send
a force to investigate.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.458
If he's alive,
he can be rescued.

14:54.542 --> 14:57.125
No one returns from Z'ha'dum.

14:57.208 --> 14:59.250
That's what we thought
about Anna Sheridan.

14:59.333 --> 15:03.000
You were wrong then,
you could be wrong now.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.875
'Are you afraid to admit
that you are capable'

15:04.958 --> 15:07.042
'of another mistake?'

15:09.083 --> 15:10.875
He's bled for you

15:10.958 --> 15:12.583
worked for you, for me

15:12.667 --> 15:14.625
for everyone here.

15:14.708 --> 15:16.083
If you turn away now

15:16.167 --> 15:19.375
if you abandon him
to die on Z'ha'dum..

15:19.458 --> 15:22.792
...I will have no more
respect left for you.

15:22.875 --> 15:24.875
Do you understand me?

15:26.250 --> 15:28.333
Respect..

15:28.417 --> 15:30.667
...is irrelevant.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.208
I'm sorry, Delenn.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.833
I'm sorry.

15:42.417 --> 15:45.458
[instrumental music]

15:48.458 --> 15:50.250
Zack to station house.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.500
Someone's in
the chief's quarters.

15:52.583 --> 15:54.708
I'm goin' in to check it out.

16:07.042 --> 16:08.458
Chief?

16:12.125 --> 16:14.375
No, I'm afraid not.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.042
G'Kar.

16:17.125 --> 16:19.417
What're you doing here?

16:19.500 --> 16:22.708
I saw him wearing this
from time to time

16:22.792 --> 16:25.583
and I thought it would help me.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.292
In all the concern
about Sheridan

16:27.375 --> 16:31.000
it seems Mr. Garibaldi
has been forgotten.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.292
No.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.208
Not forgotten.

16:34.292 --> 16:37.667
But I think he'd want
Sheridan found first.

16:37.750 --> 16:39.958
Then you think he's alive?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.250
I don't know.

16:43.333 --> 16:44.667
When you come right down to it,
it doesn't matter

16:44.750 --> 16:46.083
what I think either way.

16:46.167 --> 16:49.083
Our thoughts form the universe.

16:49.167 --> 16:51.333
They always matter.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.333
I was studying this image.

16:54.417 --> 16:56.875
'Is it one of his
household Gods?'

16:56.958 --> 17:00.083
[chuckles]
No, that's daf..

17:00.167 --> 17:02.750
Yeah, well, in a way,
I suppose it is.

17:03.958 --> 17:07.125
It's sort of the Egyptian God
of frustration.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.000
[both laughing]

17:09.083 --> 17:11.958
Most appropriate. Thank you.

17:12.042 --> 17:15.333
I came here to remind
myself of his soul.

17:15.417 --> 17:18.750
His center,
his chad'rasha we call it.

17:19.375 --> 17:21.458
It will help me.

17:21.542 --> 17:24.125
Help you what?

17:24.208 --> 17:25.792
It takes a rare kind of wisdom

17:25.875 --> 17:29.542
to accept change
and redemption in another.

17:29.625 --> 17:30.958
Many would refuse..

17:31.042 --> 17:33.583
...seeing only what was..

17:33.667 --> 17:35.208
...not what is.

17:35.292 --> 17:38.500
Mr. Garibaldi
gave me that chance.

17:38.583 --> 17:40.792
And I must repay him.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.458
So I'm going after him,
Mr. Allan.

17:42.542 --> 17:45.167
I don't know where he is
or where to start

17:45.250 --> 17:49.083
but if he is alive, I will
find him and bring him back.

17:50.917 --> 17:53.000
Good day, Mr. Allan.

17:53.083 --> 17:56.167
[instrumental music]

17:58.750 --> 18:00.250
Mollari, Mollari..

18:00.333 --> 18:01.958
I'm triple damned! Where is it?

18:02.042 --> 18:03.875
- I'm sorry?
- My coat!

18:03.958 --> 18:06.583
- I left it right here.
- Oh.

18:06.667 --> 18:09.833
Oh, oh! I sent that one
out to be cleaned.

18:09.917 --> 18:13.458
It had the air
of having traveled long.

18:13.542 --> 18:16.833
But for now, you are
needed outside quickly.

18:16.917 --> 18:18.125
No, no, no, I can't!

18:18.208 --> 18:21.458
But Emperor Cartagia insists.

18:21.542 --> 18:25.208
Besides,
it is a most glorious day.

18:25.292 --> 18:27.333
You won't want to miss it.

18:27.417 --> 18:31.083
- We'll be in the sand garden.
- Alright.

18:31.167 --> 18:34.083
[instrumental music]

18:34.167 --> 18:36.167
[sighs]

18:40.125 --> 18:42.708
(Mollari)
Yes, yes, what is it?

18:43.917 --> 18:45.417
No.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.542
Great maker, no.

18:48.625 --> 18:51.417
[intense music]

18:51.500 --> 18:53.542
[whooshing]

19:00.625 --> 19:02.375
[whooshing]

19:06.750 --> 19:08.750
Magnificent, is it not?

19:08.833 --> 19:10.083
Come away from the window.

19:10.167 --> 19:12.750
Oh, I've never seen
anything so fantastic!

19:12.833 --> 19:15.458
I said come away from the wind--
Whoa!

19:16.792 --> 19:19.250
You forget yourself, Mollari.

19:21.292 --> 19:23.750
It's an unhealthy mistake.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.625
- What have you done?
- What have I done?

19:27.708 --> 19:30.958
I've done nothing. I've given
them the Island of Celini.

19:31.042 --> 19:34.417
It's barely inhabited. Perfectly
suited for their purposes.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.833
It's a temporary situation.

19:35.917 --> 19:38.750
Shelter forces there
until things calm down.

19:38.833 --> 19:40.917
They are guests
of the Centauri Republic.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.625
- What did they give you?
- Oh!

19:42.708 --> 19:44.083
It is strategically wise

19:44.167 --> 19:46.000
to make alliances
that might prove useful.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.375
What did they give you?

19:48.458 --> 19:52.333
The one thing
I have ever wanted.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.458
Read the old books, Mollari.

19:54.542 --> 19:57.083
They speak of the ancient Gods.

19:57.167 --> 20:00.375
They speak about them. Power.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.458
Power beyond description.

20:02.542 --> 20:04.167
If their power is so great

20:04.250 --> 20:07.458
why do they need
to hide behind us? Hmm?

20:07.542 --> 20:09.458
They are using us as shields.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.958
When the war comes here,
our people will die first.

20:13.042 --> 20:16.125
Some are always sacrificed
for the greater good.

20:16.208 --> 20:19.125
- What greater good?
- Ah! Mine, of course!

20:19.208 --> 20:22.125
Mollari, I thought you
of all people understood.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.333
The emperor
is the soul of the people

20:24.417 --> 20:26.292
the center of this republic.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.125
This whole world may perish.

20:28.208 --> 20:32.292
The emperor goes on, we go on.

20:32.375 --> 20:34.667
The first emperors,
the greatest of us

20:34.750 --> 20:38.292
were themselves proclaimed
deities by the ancient Gods.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.958
In exchange for loyalty..

20:41.042 --> 20:42.875
...they became immortal.

20:42.958 --> 20:45.625
Their names revered
for generations to come.

20:45.708 --> 20:48.625
Prayers offered up to them,
even in the temples today.

20:48.708 --> 20:51.625
And now, now these Gods
of old have returned.

20:51.708 --> 20:55.333
Through them,
I will become a God myself!

20:55.417 --> 20:57.833
That is my destiny!

20:57.917 --> 21:01.792
I've known it all my life.
It is what I was born for.

21:01.875 --> 21:03.667
And when the time comes, Mollari

21:03.750 --> 21:05.750
the people will gladly
lay down their lives

21:05.833 --> 21:08.583
that I may be
elevated to Godhood.

21:09.458 --> 21:12.583
What are a few million lives

21:12.667 --> 21:16.208
compared to the glory
of becoming a living God?

21:18.083 --> 21:20.417
And when I become a God..

21:20.500 --> 21:23.917
...I will forgive you
your rudeness, Mollari.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.042
Then, my capacities will be..

21:27.125 --> 21:28.500
...infinite.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.708
'For now..'

21:30.792 --> 21:33.792
...I will simply
try to forget it.

21:43.708 --> 21:45.792
[breathing heavily]

21:48.667 --> 21:51.500
He is insane.

21:51.583 --> 21:54.250
Great maker, forgive us all.
He is mad.

21:54.333 --> 21:56.875
It is not wise..

21:56.958 --> 22:00.250
...to say such things aloud,
Londo.

22:01.333 --> 22:03.500
Others have said the same..

22:04.292 --> 22:07.000
...and disappeared.

22:07.083 --> 22:09.000
They say..

22:09.083 --> 22:11.625
...there is a desk somewhere

22:11.708 --> 22:14.500
upon which he has their heads

22:14.583 --> 22:17.208
all arranged in a row.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.500
They say..

22:20.500 --> 22:23.333
...he speaks to them,
late at night.

22:25.042 --> 22:27.917
No, i-it, it is best to

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
to remain quiet, Londo.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.625
It'll all work out..

22:35.708 --> 22:38.167
...in the end.

22:38.250 --> 22:41.292
[dramatic music]

22:44.667 --> 22:46.667
[whirring]

23:11.708 --> 23:14.667
Is there anywhere else
you needed me to carry you?

23:16.500 --> 23:18.042
No.

23:18.542 --> 23:19.958
Go.

23:24.625 --> 23:28.958
It doesn't feel the same as
when I carried Kosh with me.

23:29.042 --> 23:31.625
It's darker somehow.

23:32.958 --> 23:35.250
Is everything alright?

23:36.333 --> 23:38.042
Yes.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.542
You're planning something,
aren't you?

23:39.625 --> 23:42.000
Something that
you're not telling me.

23:50.083 --> 23:52.708
You are free for a time.

23:53.417 --> 23:56.000
Do not interfere.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.500
(man on screen)
'We have your connection
to Babylon 5, ambassador.'

24:12.583 --> 24:16.417
Yes. Put him through.
And use personal security codes.

24:17.750 --> 24:20.625
- Londo.
- Vir, I woke you. I'm sorry.

24:20.708 --> 24:22.625
I forgot
the time difference there.

24:22.708 --> 24:25.917
It's-it's alright,
I was just about to get up in..

24:26.000 --> 24:27.542
...in about six hours, but..

24:27.625 --> 24:30.625
Good. And while you're at it,
start packing.

24:30.708 --> 24:32.875
I want you here
as fast as possible.

24:32.958 --> 24:36.000
- Is there something wrong?
- 'Something? No.'

24:36.083 --> 24:38.042
Everything? Yes.

24:38.125 --> 24:40.583
Conspiracies require
more than one person

24:40.667 --> 24:43.083
and there is no one
here I trust.

24:43.167 --> 24:46.875
Come quickly, Vir.
We have much to do.

24:47.708 --> 24:50.750
[intense music]

25:00.292 --> 25:02.583
Good evening, my friends.

25:06.667 --> 25:08.750
I thought you should know.

25:08.833 --> 25:11.375
Today has been a very..

25:11.458 --> 25:13.833
...good...day.

25:17.250 --> 25:18.292
[sighs]

25:18.375 --> 25:19.917
[beeping]

25:23.500 --> 25:24.750
[beeping]

25:24.833 --> 25:28.000
- 'Yes?'
- It's Lyta Alexander.

25:28.083 --> 25:29.583
May I speak with you?

25:29.667 --> 25:31.667
[beeping]

25:35.208 --> 25:37.333
Sorry to bother you.
I know it's late.

25:37.417 --> 25:39.417
That's alright.
I wasn't sleeping.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.250
I haven't slept since..

25:42.500 --> 25:45.042
- Can I get you something?
- No, thank you.

25:45.125 --> 25:47.708
Ah, then if you don't mind..

25:56.167 --> 25:58.500
Have you ever heard
of the hour of the wolf?

25:58.583 --> 26:00.250
No.

26:00.333 --> 26:02.583
My father told me
about it, it's..

26:02.667 --> 26:05.625
...it's the time between
3 and 4 in the morning.

26:05.708 --> 26:08.375
You can't sleep
and...all you can see

26:08.458 --> 26:11.292
is the...troubles
and the problems

26:11.375 --> 26:15.792
and...the ways that
your life should've gone

26:15.875 --> 26:18.667
but...didn't.

26:18.750 --> 26:22.792
All you can hear is...the sound
of your own heart.

26:24.792 --> 26:28.208
I've been living
in the hour of the wolf..

26:28.292 --> 26:30.708
...for seven days, Lyta.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.250
Seven days.

26:35.417 --> 26:38.917
The wolf and I are now
on a first name basis.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.083
Oh. Please.

26:45.167 --> 26:47.833
In times like this..

26:47.917 --> 26:49.667
...my father used to take..

26:49.750 --> 26:53.333
...one large glass
of vodka before bed.

26:53.417 --> 26:56.292
To keep the wolf away, he said.

26:56.375 --> 26:58.667
And then he would take three..

26:58.750 --> 27:01.792
...very small drinks of vodka..

27:01.875 --> 27:05.292
...just in case she had cubs
while she was waiting outside.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.583
Doesn't work.

27:10.667 --> 27:12.833
Have you had any luck
trying to convince the others

27:12.917 --> 27:15.208
to send a rescue ship
to Z'ha'dum?

27:15.292 --> 27:18.417
No, they're sure he's dead.
Why rescue a dead man?

27:19.583 --> 27:21.708
I just wish we knew
one way or the other.

27:21.792 --> 27:23.375
There may be a way.

27:23.458 --> 27:26.583
The White Star can jump out
of hyperspace near Z'ha'dum.

27:26.667 --> 27:28.917
You can scan for any signals.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.792
If he is alive, I know he'd find
some way to try and contact you.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.625
But the Shadows
would be on us in a second.

27:34.708 --> 27:37.333
I think I can block any ships
in the area telepathically.

27:37.417 --> 27:39.417
Not for long,
just for a few minutes.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.083
Enough to try and contact him.

27:41.167 --> 27:43.208
But that's assuming that
he was able to send a message

27:43.292 --> 27:45.833
within that window,
I mean, if not..

27:45.917 --> 27:47.375
That's the other thing.

27:47.458 --> 27:51.208
If he is alive,
I may be able to sense him.

27:52.875 --> 27:56.250
I thought that telepaths had
to be in direct line of sight

27:56.333 --> 27:58.167
to do something like that.

27:58.250 --> 28:00.083
Normally, yes.

28:00.167 --> 28:03.583
But Sheridan had let
Kosh into his mind.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.917
He was sensitive to Kosh

28:07.000 --> 28:11.250
and Kosh was sensitive to me.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.958
It's a long shot, I won't be
able to establish contact

28:14.042 --> 28:17.750
but it might be enough for me
to sense if he's alive or not.

28:17.833 --> 28:21.583
This...link between
you and the Vorlons..

28:23.000 --> 28:26.042
...there's more to it than
you're telling me, isn't there?

28:29.167 --> 28:31.208
Typical.

28:31.292 --> 28:34.667
But you know what?
Right now I don't care.

28:42.417 --> 28:43.792
Ivanova to C&amp;C.

28:43.875 --> 28:45.958
Patch me through to
Ambassador Delenn's quarters.

28:46.042 --> 28:48.458
(female #1)
'Stand by.'

28:48.542 --> 28:49.625
I hope you're right
about getting us in

28:49.708 --> 28:51.875
and out of there in one piece.

28:51.958 --> 28:54.583
Because if we go down
in Z'ha'dum..

28:54.667 --> 28:57.042
...nobody's gonna come after us.

28:59.750 --> 29:02.500
[intense music]

29:02.583 --> 29:05.042
They say they're ready
to enter normal space.

29:05.125 --> 29:06.125
You set?

29:06.208 --> 29:07.208
I'll start jamming
them as soon

29:07.292 --> 29:09.208
as we come out of hyperspace.

29:09.292 --> 29:10.792
I don't know how long
I can hold them off

29:10.875 --> 29:12.583
but I'll do the best that I can.

29:12.667 --> 29:15.417
Alright. Take us in.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.625
[speaking in foreign language]

29:26.125 --> 29:28.792
Scanning all frequencies.

29:28.875 --> 29:30.375
Anything?

29:33.292 --> 29:35.875
Nothing that I can recognize.

29:35.958 --> 29:38.958
Lyta, are they aware of us yet?

29:41.500 --> 29:43.250
Lyta?

29:44.583 --> 29:46.750
Are they aware of us?

29:46.833 --> 29:49.875
[dramatic music]

29:51.500 --> 29:53.333
Are you alright?

29:53.417 --> 29:55.208
Hurry.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.958
I can...feel them.

30:02.042 --> 30:03.542
Open up a channel,
use the frequency

30:03.625 --> 30:05.083
for the captain's link.

30:05.167 --> 30:07.875
- They might pick it up.
- We'll take that chance.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.792
Ivanova to Sheridan.
This is Ivanova to Sheridan.

30:11.875 --> 30:13.958
Can you receive?

30:14.042 --> 30:16.208
Ivanova to Sheridan,
if you can receive this

30:16.292 --> 30:18.250
please send us a signal.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.875
Keep sending it.

30:22.958 --> 30:24.542
'Are you getting anything?'

30:24.625 --> 30:26.542
'Can you feel him?'

30:26.625 --> 30:28.292
(Lyta)
No.

30:29.083 --> 30:31.083
[gasps]

30:32.958 --> 30:34.583
John..

30:36.542 --> 30:38.667
...we're here.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.958
Can you hear us?

30:41.625 --> 30:43.375
John?

30:43.458 --> 30:45.167
Can you hear us?

30:45.250 --> 30:47.750
We've come to take you home.

30:47.833 --> 30:51.208
Send us a word,
and we will hear it.

30:53.167 --> 30:55.292
Think of me..

30:55.375 --> 30:57.542
...and we will feel it.

30:58.792 --> 31:00.958
We will find you.

31:01.792 --> 31:03.583
'John..'

31:05.042 --> 31:06.917
Are you there?

31:08.958 --> 31:11.083
Can you hear me?

31:11.750 --> 31:14.000
[gasps]

31:14.083 --> 31:16.000
They heard us.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.875
They know we're here.

31:21.375 --> 31:23.500
The eye..

31:23.583 --> 31:25.792
...is looking for us.

31:27.375 --> 31:30.417
[intense music]

31:34.083 --> 31:36.458
I've felt this before.

31:37.667 --> 31:40.333
I've been here before.

31:43.875 --> 31:45.917
[buzzing]

32:00.417 --> 32:03.500
[music continues]

32:09.208 --> 32:11.042
Did you hear that?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.083
It knows our names.

32:16.958 --> 32:18.875
Take us down.

32:20.333 --> 32:22.042
Take us..

32:24.417 --> 32:27.458
[dramatic music]

32:34.917 --> 32:37.750
What, what happened?
How did we-,h

32:37.833 --> 32:41.042
I was concerned that there might
be a fight upon arrival.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.792
In the event that something
might happen to me

32:42.875 --> 32:44.708
I programmed the computer
to open a jump point

32:44.792 --> 32:47.083
and return home
if I did not touch

32:47.167 --> 32:50.708
this control once
every two standard minutes.

32:50.792 --> 32:52.500
Are you alright?

32:52.583 --> 32:54.292
Yeah. Tired.

32:54.375 --> 32:56.333
I'll be alright in a minute.

33:03.667 --> 33:07.125
- You heard it then too.
- Yes.

33:07.208 --> 33:10.917
It knew everything about me.
It was...calling to me.

33:12.125 --> 33:14.750
I would've gone down
there if we hadn't..

33:16.792 --> 33:19.083
What, what did it say to you?

33:19.167 --> 33:21.708
Nothing I can put into words.

33:21.792 --> 33:25.083
A voice of infinite sadness.

33:25.167 --> 33:27.167
It spoke in the voice
of my father.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.250
And mine.

33:29.333 --> 33:30.792
Lennier, get us
the hell out of here.

33:30.875 --> 33:33.917
Initiating "Getting the hell
out of here" maneuver.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.750
Did you continue to monitor
until the last possible minute?

33:37.833 --> 33:40.750
Yes, I did.
There was no signal.

33:48.208 --> 33:50.375
I'm sorry, Delenn.

33:58.667 --> 34:01.708
[instrumental music]

34:33.833 --> 34:35.583
Yes.

34:35.667 --> 34:38.292
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

34:38.375 --> 34:40.625
They had a hard time finding me
a place to stay on the grounds

34:40.708 --> 34:42.000
so I had to go way away--

34:42.083 --> 34:44.542
Vir, Vir, Vir, shh.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.333
Oh, my.

34:47.417 --> 34:50.667
Every time I find one
listening device and remove it

34:50.750 --> 34:52.875
they plant another.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.708
But we can talk for now.

34:56.792 --> 34:57.875
What's this all about?

34:57.958 --> 35:01.333
Emperor Cartagia is insane.

35:01.417 --> 35:04.958
He has made a deal
with these Shadows

35:05.042 --> 35:07.583
allowing them a base here..

35:07.667 --> 35:11.000
...in the belief that
they will grant him Godhood.

35:11.083 --> 35:12.375
'Like the emperors of old.'

35:12.458 --> 35:15.375
He wants to be immortal,
to be worshipped.

35:15.458 --> 35:19.417
And he does not care who pays
the price for his deification.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.042
Does anyone else
know about this?

35:21.125 --> 35:24.542
Vir, when you are mad,
you say these things

35:24.625 --> 35:27.125
the same way that you and I
talk about the weather.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.833
Of course, the others know

35:28.917 --> 35:31.042
but they are afraid
to move against him.

35:31.125 --> 35:34.375
Whoever does so will almost
certainly be killed.

35:34.458 --> 35:36.583
Ah. That would be a drawback.

35:36.667 --> 35:39.750
These creatures
must be driven away

35:39.833 --> 35:41.583
before it's too late.

35:41.667 --> 35:44.708
We must stop Cartagia,
no matter the cost.

35:44.792 --> 35:47.875
The cost, that would be
the dying thing, right?

35:47.958 --> 35:49.667
Vir..

35:49.750 --> 35:51.708
...it is a terrible truth..

35:51.792 --> 35:56.333
...but as one accumulates power,
one loses friends.

35:56.417 --> 35:59.750
One only has those
who wish to use you..

35:59.833 --> 36:01.875
...and those you wish to use.

36:01.958 --> 36:05.875
And yet, in all of this,
you have somehow managed

36:05.958 --> 36:08.042
to walk through
the corridors of power

36:08.125 --> 36:09.583
and not be touched.

36:09.667 --> 36:13.083
I can only assume you have
not been paying attention.

36:13.167 --> 36:17.083
And still,
the hideous truth is..

36:17.167 --> 36:18.375
...you..

36:18.458 --> 36:22.333
...are the closest thing
I have to a friend.

36:22.417 --> 36:25.250
I am as shocked and dismayed
by this as you are

36:25.333 --> 36:27.292
but there it is.

36:28.083 --> 36:30.042
I need a friend, Vir.

36:30.833 --> 36:32.708
And I need a patriot.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.375
And you are both.

36:36.750 --> 36:39.542
Will you help me? Please?

36:41.292 --> 36:43.583
If you had any doubt
what my answer would be

36:43.667 --> 36:46.500
would you have asked me
to come this far?

36:46.583 --> 36:50.375
No. No, I wouldn't have.

36:50.458 --> 36:54.250
And now we must do everything
we can to save our world.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.833
You and I, Vir..

36:57.917 --> 37:01.000
...must kill Emperor Cartagia.

but I can't keep on denying it.

37:49.792 --> 37:52.375
The captain's dead..

37:52.458 --> 37:54.708
...and I have to accept that.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.333
What matters now..

37:57.417 --> 38:00.583
...is finishing the work
that he began.

38:00.667 --> 38:04.375
I have some ideas how to do that
but I'm gonna need some help.

38:04.458 --> 38:07.708
I think I know
where to go to find it.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.458
I have to let him go..

38:13.917 --> 38:16.208
...and just get on
with the work.

38:17.208 --> 38:19.375
I think..

...I hope..

Why am I alive?

Well..

39:18.917 --> 39:21.708
...that is the question..

39:21.792 --> 39:23.667
...isn't it?
