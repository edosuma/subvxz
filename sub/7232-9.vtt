19:21.827 --> 19:22.870
- IS HE UNDER A ROCK?

19:22.953 --> 19:25.414
- NO, BUT HE IS IN TROUBLE.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.917
- STILL...HAVING...FUN.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.919
- NO WAY WE'LL
GET THERE IN TIME.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.629
- [yelps]

19:32.713 --> 19:34.965
- [screams]

19:35.048 --> 19:37.050
- WHOO!

19:39.511 --> 19:41.555
- [groans]

19:41.638 --> 19:43.765
- GOTCHA.
- OW.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.059
- HMM, LOOKS LIKE
YOUR ANKLE'S BROKEN.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.854
- WE HAVE NO NAVIGATION DEVICES,
FOOD, OR SHELTER.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.898
- LET'S NOT EVEN TALK
ABOUT THE BOWLING ALLEY.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.358
- THEN WE'RE DOOMED.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.319
I WON'T LAST LONG
WITH THIS BUM LEG.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.488
BUT IF YOU THREE FEED ON ME,
YOU MIGHT MAKE IT.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.449
- ANYBODY BRING SOME SOY SAUCE?

20:00.532 --> 20:02.951
- NO WAY!
I'M GONNA GET US OUT OF THIS.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.953
- YOU?
- I WAS A BUTTERFLY GIRL.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.205
AND EVEN THOUGH SELLING PROTEIN
BARS OUTSIDE OF SUPERMARKETS

20:07.289 --> 20:08.749
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE SITUATION WE'RE IN,

20:08.832 --> 20:12.628
I GOT THIS.
- [screams]

20:12.711 --> 20:15.464
NOW, SUSAN, ALL THAT TALK
IS JUST SO MUCH HOT AIR.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.801
I SHOULD PROVIDE AT LEAST
THREE DAYS OF SUSTENANCE.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.762
FOUR IF YOU
TAKE SENSIBLE PORTIONS.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.472
- HOW MUCH
ARE YOUR SENSIBLE PORTIONS?

20:23.555 --> 20:24.473
- HOT AIR.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.807
THAT'S THE ANSWER.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.726
- SUSAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:27.809 --> 20:29.061
- MAKING A FIRE.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.938
I DID THIS ONCE
WITH THE BUTTERFLIES.

20:31.021 --> 20:34.608
WE NEEDED TO LIGHT A SCENTED
CANDLE AT OUR CRAFTS FAIR.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.485
- WHOO, IT'S A BARBECUE.

20:36.568 --> 20:40.113
WHO WANTS SOME
PRIME USDA MONGER SHANKS?

20:40.197 --> 20:41.031
- SORRY, GENERAL.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.491
NOBODY'S EATING YOU TODAY.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.492
- I'M DELICIOUS.

20:43.575 --> 20:44.034
- B.O.B., INHALE.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.995
- [inhales]

20:47.079 --> 20:49.164
- QUICK, GRAB ON.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.003
THERE'S THE BASE.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.672
90 DEGREES NORTHEAST, BOB.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.591
LET IT RIP.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.677
- [blows]

21:01.760 --> 21:06.306
- YAHOO!

21:06.390 --> 21:08.850
- GENERAL MONGER,
I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE

21:08.934 --> 21:10.811
THAT I HAVE COMPLETED
MY EARTH STUDIES REPORT

21:10.894 --> 21:12.229
ON THE CAMPING EXPERIENCE.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.315
- SUMMED UP
AS AWE-INSPIRING, RIGHT?

21:15.399 --> 21:17.859
- ACTUALLY, SUMMED UP
AS A NOSTALGIC ATTEMPT

21:17.943 --> 21:20.570
TO RETURN TO A SIMPLER TIME
BY FORCING ONE'S SELF

21:20.654 --> 21:22.948
INTO A PREHISTORIC CONNECTION
WITH THE ENVIRONMENT.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.367
- LIKE I SAID, AWE-INSPIRING.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.577
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WHEN THE CHIPS WERE DOWN

21:27.661 --> 21:31.206
YOU CAMPERS
REALLY PULLED TOGETHER.

21:31.289 --> 21:34.167
- A BUTTERFLY GIRL
CAMPING BADGE? HOW?

21:34.251 --> 21:36.169
- I KNOW A GUY WHO KNOWS A GUY
WHO KNOWS A GIRL.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.714
ANYWAY, WEAR IT WITH PRIDE.

21:38.797 --> 21:39.923
YOU EARNED IT.

21:40.007 --> 21:40.632
- I'M SO HONORED.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.552
- ME TOO.

21:43.635 --> 21:44.636
[burps]
