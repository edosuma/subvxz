WEBVTT

00:02.043 --> 00:03.545
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.628 --> 00:05.088
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.171 --> 00:07.424
- OF COURSE
I'LL MARRY YOU.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.717
- I WILL!

00:08.800 --> 00:11.428
- OH, GOD, YES.

00:11.511 --> 00:12.846
- WELL, THAT'S VERY SWEET
OF YOU LADIES,

00:12.929 --> 00:14.764
BUT I'M PROPOSING
TO VICTORIA.

00:14.848 --> 00:18.810
- YOU SURE?

00:18.893 --> 00:22.522
I'VE ALWAYS PICTURED YOU
WITH AN OLDER WOMAN.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.108
- ACTUALLY,
I HAVE ANOTHER RING,

00:25.191 --> 00:28.111
BUT I'M WORRIED
THAT THE DIAMOND IS TOO BIG.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.447
- THAT SENTENCE
DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.656
LET ME SEE.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.492
- [squeals]
OH!

00:34.576 --> 00:37.120
- ALL RIGHT, VERY FUNNY.
- WHAT?

00:37.203 --> 00:38.455
- YOU'RE IMITATING ME
IN FRONT OF YOUR FRIENDS?

00:38.538 --> 00:39.998
- NO! HONEST.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.166
WE WEREN'T EVEN
TALKING ABOUT THAT.

00:41.249 --> 00:44.627
- BUT NOW WE HAVE TO.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.880
- UH, ALEC SAW A MOUSE
IN OUR APARTMENT LAST NIGHT,

00:46.963 --> 00:48.882
AND HE MADE
THE CUTEST SOUND,

00:48.965 --> 00:52.635
LIKE A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.680
- IT WAS A MANLY GASP.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.016
I MADE THE SAME GASP
WHEN OHIO STATE BEAT MICHIGAN.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.643
- IN GYMNASTICS?

01:02.437 --> 01:03.563
- THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF MICE AROUND

01:03.646 --> 01:05.482
BECAUSE OF THE RAIN.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.650
- OH, THERE WAS A CUTE ONE
IN THE MAILBOX THIS MORNING.

01:07.734 --> 01:12.113
- SO THEY'RE HERE TOO?

01:12.197 --> 01:13.823
I DON'T LIKE THEM.
THEY FREAK ME OUT.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.283
- I UNDERSTAND.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.534
ONCE, IN INDIA,

01:16.618 --> 01:20.455
I WAS STARTLED
BY A CROUCHING BENGAL TIGER.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.874
EVERY MAN HAS SOMETHING THAT
SENDS TERROR DOWN THEIR BONES.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.334
FOR ME, IT'S TIGERS.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.170
FOR ALEC, IT'S MICE.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.881
- SO WHAT WAS
THE SQUEALING ABOUT?

01:29.964 --> 01:32.383
- OH, EMMET IS GONNA PROPOSE
TO VICTORIA.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.635
- HEY!
CONGRATULATIONS!

01:33.718 --> 01:35.178
- I HAVE IT ALL ARRANGED.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.846
ON OUR WAY
TO MOROCCO TOMORROW,

01:36.930 --> 01:39.015
I'LL HAVE MY PLANE
LAND AT GRAND CAYMAN

01:39.098 --> 01:40.683
SO WE CAN SWIM
WITH THE DOLPHINS.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.352
ON MY SIGNAL,

01:42.435 --> 01:44.896
VICTORIA'S DOLPHIN
WILL DIVE TO THE OCEAN FLOOR

01:44.979 --> 01:48.983
AND RETURN
WITH A RING BOX.

01:50.902 --> 01:51.903
WHAT IS IT?

01:51.986 --> 01:53.446
- VICTORIA'S FOURTH HUSBAND

01:53.530 --> 01:56.032
PROPOSED TO HER
BY DOLPHIN.

01:57.659 --> 01:58.701
- OH, WELL, NO WORRIES.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.411
I HAVE A BACKUP PLAN.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.038
DAVID COPPERFIELD

02:02.121 --> 02:03.414
WILL MAKE THE PYRAMIDS
DISAPPEAR,

02:03.498 --> 02:04.874
REVEALING THE SPHINX,

02:04.958 --> 02:07.210
HOLDING A SIGN SAYING,
"MARRY ME."

02:07.293 --> 02:10.880
- SECOND HUSBAND.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.174
ALSO, VICTORIA HAD NO IDEA

02:13.258 --> 02:14.717
THE PYRAMIDS WERE THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.345
SO IT'S KINDA LOST ON HER.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.515
- OH!
HEY, I KNOW.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.268
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE BILLY JOEL
SING YOUR PROPOSAL?

02:23.351 --> 02:26.521
- I DID THAT
FOR MY THIRD WIFE.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.899
SHE LEFT ME FOR HIM,
ACTUALLY.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.569
- WELL, I'M SURE WE CAN
COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.237
- WELL, IT'S GONNA BE
DIFFICULT.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.239
WITH VICTORIA'S FIVE MARRIAGES
AND MY FOUR,

02:36.322 --> 02:41.369
IT'S HARD TO FIND A UNIQUE WAY
TO SAY, "I LOVE YOU FOREVER."

02:41.452 --> 02:44.247
- WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE
SO UNIQUE?

02:44.330 --> 02:45.915
MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE
I'M FROM CLEVELAND,

02:45.999 --> 02:49.085
BUT ISN'T TAKING SOMEONE
TO A NICE RESTAURANT

02:49.168 --> 02:50.420
AND TELLING HER
THAT YOU WANNA SPEND

02:50.503 --> 02:52.046
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH HER
SPECIAL ENOUGH?

02:52.130 --> 02:54.549
- SPECIAL ENOUGH FOR VICTORIA?
NO.

02:54.632 --> 02:58.970
SHE GIVES AN ACCEPTANCE SPEECH
WHEN YOU PASS HER THE SALT.

02:59.053 --> 03:02.765
NO, IT HAS TO HAVE SOME HUGE,
SURPRISING TWIST

03:02.849 --> 03:03.933
THAT SHE WOULD NEVER EXPECT.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.768
- SHE CAN'T
GO ON TALK SHOWS

03:05.852 --> 03:08.771
AND SAY THAT I JUST PROPOSED
AT A RESTAURANT.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.607
- WAIT A MINUTE.

03:10.690 --> 03:14.652
MAYBE ALEC'S STUPID IDEA
ISN'T AS STUPID AS IT SOUNDS.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.614
MAYBE THE TWIST IS
THAT THERE IS NO TWIST.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.282
- YES, WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT ALEC'S STUPID IDEA

03:19.365 --> 03:22.160
IS THAT VICTORIA WOULD NEVER
EXPECT ANYTHING SO ORDINARY.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.413
- LET ME "YES, AND"
ALEC'S STUPID IDEA...

03:25.496 --> 03:28.625
AND SUGGEST WE HIDE THE RING
IN A DESSERT.

03:28.708 --> 03:32.337
- GREAT! WE'LL GO
WITH ALEC'S STUPID IDEA!

03:32.420 --> 03:34.422
- AND I KNOW
THIS IS PRESUMPTUOUS,

03:34.505 --> 03:35.632
BUT DO YOU THINK
MAYBE WE COULD ALL GO TOO

03:35.715 --> 03:36.633
SO WE COULD WATCH?

03:36.716 --> 03:38.176
- OF COURSE.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.136
WE'LL CALL IT
A FAREWELL DINNER.

03:40.219 --> 03:42.138
THAT WAY, YOU CAN ALL BE THERE
TO SQUEAL WHEN I ASK HER--

03:42.221 --> 03:45.266
OR GASP IN A MANLY WAY.

03:46.726 --> 03:50.188
- WELL, AT LEAST
I'M NOT AFRAID OF TIGERS.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.148
- HONEY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE SO DEFENSIVE.

03:52.231 --> 03:54.275
I THINK IT'S ADORABLE
THAT YOU HAVE A FEMININE SIDE.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.110
- WHAT? I DON'T HAVE
A FEMININE SIDE.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.947
[whistle]
OOH! IT'S MY TEA KETTLE.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.158
- YEAH, BUT JUST
DON'T DRINK TOO MUCH.

04:02.241 --> 04:06.829
I DON'T WANT YOUR LEG BOUNCING
ALL THROUGH <i> PROJECT RUNWAY.</i>

04:10.249 --> 04:12.168
- MELANIE,
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING,

04:12.251 --> 04:13.544
I THINK YOU HANDLED THAT
TERRIBLY.

04:13.628 --> 04:14.879
- WHAT?

04:14.963 --> 04:16.339
- YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP
HIS MALE EGO.

04:16.422 --> 04:20.301
ALEC IS A MAN.
MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE ONE.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.888
- MAYBE ALEC WOULD
FEEL MORE LIKE A MAN

04:23.972 --> 04:29.227
IF EMMET AND I
HAD A FLING.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.355
- HOW WOULD THAT HELP?

04:32.438 --> 04:35.233
- IT WOULD HELP ME.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.370
{\an8}- OKAY, ALEC'S COMING,

04:47.453 --> 04:49.372
{\an8}AND I HAVE A PLAN
TO MAKE HIM FEEL MORE MANLY.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.708
{\an8}OOH!
I CAN'T OPEN THIS JAR.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.710
{\an8}AND ME WANTING A PICKLE
SO BAD!

04:53.793 --> 04:55.753
{\an8}HI, HONEY.
- HEY.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.630
{\an8}YOU WANT ME TO GET THAT FOR YOU?
- YEAH, THANKS.

04:57.714 --> 05:01.134
{\an8}IT'S SO NICE HAVING A MAN
AROUND THE HOUSE WHO CAN OPEN--

05:04.345 --> 05:08.016
{\an8}- WHAT'S PLAN "B"?

05:08.099 --> 05:09.392
{\an8}- I CAN'T GET A GOOD GRIP.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.893
{\an8}DO YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE
RUBBER GRIPPY THINGS?

05:10.977 --> 05:11.894
{\an8}- YEAH, I THINK SO.

05:11.978 --> 05:15.023
{\an8}- OOH, PICKLES.

05:17.525 --> 05:22.363
{\an8}- UH, DON'T FEEL BAD.
JOY HAS MAN HANDS.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.323
{\an8}- AND I DON'T?
- YOU KNOW, FORGET THE PICKLES.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.117
{\an8}WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT BACK
AND CHOP US SOME FIREWOOD?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.243
{\an8}- GOOD IDEA.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.078
{\an8}- HAVE YOU EVER
HANDLED AN AXE BEFORE?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.872
{\an8}- OF COURSE I HAVE.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.081
{\an8}IN HIGH SCHOOL, I WAS IN

05:32.165 --> 05:34.917
{\an8}<i>SEVEN BRIDES</i>
<i>FOR SEVEN BROTHERS.</i>

05:36.502 --> 05:39.922
{\an8}- SHOULD WE CALL
THE PARAMEDICS NOW, OR WAIT?

05:40.006 --> 05:43.217
{\an8}- 9-1--
I'M READY.

05:44.802 --> 05:47.597
{\an8}- HELLO, EVERYONE.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.557
{\an8}- OH, HONEY, YOU HAVE MASCARA
ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.601
{\an8}- OH!
DOES ANYONE HAVE A TISSUE?

05:51.684 --> 05:54.062
{\an8}- OH, HELP YOURSELF.
- OH, THANKS.

05:55.646 --> 05:56.939
{\an8}- WHY WERE YOU CRYING?

05:57.023 --> 05:57.982
{\an8}- OH, WELL,
YOU KNOW HOW EMOTIONAL I GET

05:58.066 --> 05:59.484
{\an8}WHEN I'M HAPPY.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.819
{\an8}AND I WAS OUT SHOPPING
FOR MY TRIP WITH EMMET,

06:01.903 --> 06:03.946
{\an8}AND I STARTED THINKING.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.615
WHEN I CAME HERE
THREE YEARS AGO,

06:05.698 --> 06:08.451
MY CAREER WAS IN THE TOILET,
NOBODY WANTED ME.

06:08.534 --> 06:09.786
AND NOW...

06:09.869 --> 06:12.789
THERE'S TALK OF
AN ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATION.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.750
- FROM YOU.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.294
- STILL, THERE'S TALK.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.630
AND TOMORROW,
I AM GOING TO MOROCCO

06:20.713 --> 06:22.298
WITH THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.926
- OH, HONEY,
WE'RE SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.260
WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.971
- WELL,
I'M GONNA MISS YOU TOO.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.681
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:30.765 --> 06:32.809
I AM GONNA BE SPENDING THE NEXT
THREE MONTHS WITH EMMET,

06:32.892 --> 06:35.603
SO HOW ABOUT I CANCEL
THE FAREWELL DINNER

06:35.686 --> 06:37.480
AND WE HAVE
A GIRLS' NIGHT INSTEAD?

06:37.563 --> 06:38.856
[all react]
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT, UH-HUH.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.651
- AH.

06:41.734 --> 06:45.113
- WELL, UM, BECAUSE THERE'S,
UM, GONNA BE PRESS THERE.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.950
- [excited whisper]
THERE'S GONNA BE PRESS?

06:49.033 --> 06:52.662
OH, I LOVE PRESS.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.205
OH, NO, THAT MEANS
I ONLY HAVE, WHAT...

06:54.288 --> 06:56.874
SIX HOURS
TO GET CAMERA-READY.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.001
THAT ONLY ALLOWS ME TWO TIMES
TO HATE WHAT I'VE DONE

06:59.085 --> 07:01.754
AND START ALL OVER.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.549
- AHH!

07:04.632 --> 07:07.385
- AND ONE.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.893
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
MY PLEASURE.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.311
[camera clicks]

07:17.395 --> 07:19.397
- [winces]

07:19.480 --> 07:21.065
MY BACK IS KILLING ME!

07:21.149 --> 07:22.316
- I KNOW, BABY.
I'M SORRY.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.110
BUT IT IS KINDA HOT
THAT YOU HURT IT

07:24.193 --> 07:25.987
DOING SUCH A MANLY THING.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.196
- YEAH, WELL,
I'D FEEL A LOT MORE MANLY

07:27.280 --> 07:28.656
IF I WEREN'T...

07:28.739 --> 07:29.991
YOU KNOW...

07:30.074 --> 07:33.578
WEARING YOUR SPANX.

07:33.661 --> 07:36.372
- WEBMD SAID YOU HAD TO WEAR
SOMETHING TO SUPPORT YOUR BACK,

07:36.455 --> 07:39.083
AND YOU COULDN'T EVEN WALK
BEFORE YOU PUT THOSE ON.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.920
AND ON THE PLUS SIDE,
YOU HAVE NO VISIBLE PANTY LINES.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.839
- I DON'T HAVE
ANY VISIBLE ANYTHING.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.591
I'M LIKE A KEN DOLL.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.551
- YOU ARE THE MOST
MASCULINE MAN HERE,

07:48.634 --> 07:49.886
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.345
- WELL, THANK YOU.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.640
[wincing]

07:56.100 --> 07:58.269
- HELLO.
- HEY, EMMET.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.479
- ALEC.
- EMMET.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.069
- WELL, IT'S ALL ARRANGED.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.405
AFTER DINNER,
YOU AND JOY WILL SLIP AWAY

08:09.488 --> 08:12.408
AND HIDE THIS RING
IN A CHOCOLATE MOUSSE.

08:12.491 --> 08:14.702
AH, THERE'S MY GIRL.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.456
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

08:18.539 --> 08:19.749
- WELL, SHE SAID
SHE WANTED TO STAY IN TONIGHT,

08:19.832 --> 08:23.586
SO I TOLD HER
THAT YOU HAD PRESS COMING.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.759
- YOU DO KNOW
SHE'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

08:29.842 --> 08:32.761
- KNOW IT AND LOVE IT.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.764
- OKAY, THE RING IS IN.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.432
- OH, I AM SO EXCITED.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.600
I COULD BARELY MAKE IT
THROUGH DINNER.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.934
LET ME JUST SMOOTH THE TOP.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.727
MM.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.145
THIS IS SO GOOD!

08:42.230 --> 08:43.606
AND THE BEST PART IS,

08:43.688 --> 08:46.442
THERE ARE NO CALORIES
IN PROPOSAL DESSERT.

08:46.525 --> 08:48.903
- OH, I FORGOT THAT SCIENCE.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.988
HEY, HIT ME WITH
THAT PROPOSAL WHIPPED CREAM.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.743
both: MM. MM.

08:55.826 --> 08:59.080
- DOES THIS FEEL
A LITTLE PORN-Y TO YOU?

08:59.163 --> 09:01.332
- I DON'T CARE.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.501
- OH, LOOK AT HER
OUT THERE...

09:03.584 --> 09:07.630
FIGHTING HER HAPPINESS
SO SHE DOESN'T RUIN HER MAKEUP.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.131
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE HER

09:09.215 --> 09:10.591
FOR THREE WHOLE MONTHS.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.635
- THE HOUSE
IS GOING TO SEEM SO EMPTY.

09:12.718 --> 09:16.806
YOU'RE LIVING WITH ALEC,
AND NOW SHE'S GETTING ENGAGED.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.975
WAIT, ENGAGED.

09:19.058 --> 09:22.645
I'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON
THIS PROPOSAL, I FORGOT.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.981
VICTORIA'S GETTING MARRIED
AND SHE'LL LIVE WITH EMMET.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.649
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.985
SHE MIGHT NOT COME BACK
TO CLEVELAND AT ALL.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.654
WELL, WHY ARE WE EVEN HELPING
WITH THIS STUPID PROPOSAL?

09:31.737 --> 09:34.615
[both laughing]

09:34.699 --> 09:37.451
- BECAUSE IT MAKES HER HAPPY.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.120
- WELL,
WE CAN BE HAPPY FOR HER

09:39.203 --> 09:41.664
AND SAD FOR US
AT THE SAME TIME, RIGHT?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.165
- YES.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.167
BUT TONIGHT'S HER NIGHT.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.045
COME ON, LET'S GET THE MOUSSE
TO THE WAITER AND--

09:48.129 --> 09:49.630
- [gasps]
WHERE'D IT GO?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.549
- SOMEONE'S TAKEN IT.
- WELL, WHAT DO WE DO?

09:51.632 --> 09:55.011
- WE JUST LOST
A $500,000 DIAMOND RING!

09:55.094 --> 09:56.971
I SAY WE PANIC.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.893
- OKAY,
LET'S RETRACE OUR STEPS.

10:02.977 --> 10:07.064
- WE PUT THE RING IN THE MOUSSE.
THAT WAS OUR ONLY STEP!

10:07.148 --> 10:08.733
- AND THEN WE TURNED AROUND.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.152
AAH!
- AAH!

10:11.235 --> 10:12.403
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WE LOST THE RING.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.863
- BUT DON'T TELL EMMET.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.156
JUST GET VICTORIA
TO THE LADIES' ROOM

10:15.239 --> 10:16.365
WHILE WE LOOK FOR IT.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.117
- UH, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO SAY TO HER?

10:18.200 --> 10:19.869
- JUST TELL HER
TO REAPPLY HER FOUNDATION.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.287
- HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT?
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.872
SHE'S A WOMAN.
IT'S A CRITICISM.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.749
SHE'LL BELIEVE YOU.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.296
SHOULD I ASK?
- NO, NO, NO.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.340
- VICTORIA...

10:32.423 --> 10:34.842
YOUR FOUNDATION,
IT LOOKS--

10:34.925 --> 10:35.885
- WHAT?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.386
- WELL, YOU KNOW.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.721
- OH, MY GOD.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.514
I'M HIDEOUS!

10:40.598 --> 10:42.892
LOOK AWAY.
LOOK AWAY.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.436
LOOK AWAY!

10:47.229 --> 10:48.439
- IT'S NOT IN THE KITCHEN.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.524
- WELL, THAT RING
DID NOT JUST DISAPPEAR.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.817
WHERE COULD IT BE?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.487
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S A RING!

10:56.155 --> 10:58.449
- OH, NO,
I'VE BEEN UPSTAGED.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.076
- OF COURSE I'LL MARRY YOU.

11:01.577 --> 11:05.247
- FALSE ALARM!
FALSE ALARM.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.582
NO, NO, NO.
DON'T CLAP, DON'T CLAP.

11:06.665 --> 11:09.460
SEE, 'CAUSE HE DIDN'T
REALLY PROPOSE.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.295
- WHAT?
- WAIT, WHA-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.005
- WE PUT THIS RING
IN THE MOUSSE.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.799
- BUT I--
- WAIT!

11:18.010 --> 11:19.428
- OH, IT'S NOT OUR RING!

11:19.512 --> 11:22.640
OUR DIAMOND IS HUGE,
THIS ONE'S TINY.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.184
NOT THAT THAT'S NOT NICE.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.977
YOU KNOW,
IT'S GOOD TO BE PRACTICAL.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.270
WANT TO BUY A HOUSE
ONE DAY.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.815
HE'S A GOOD ONE YOU GOT
RIGHT HERE.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.817
- SO, HOW'D YOU TWO MEET?

11:32.900 --> 11:34.443
- COULD YOU PLEASE GO NOW?

11:34.527 --> 11:38.572
- THEY'RE ENGAGED, EVERYBODY!
ENGAGED!

11:38.656 --> 11:40.282
- YOU LOST MY RING?

11:40.366 --> 11:41.659
- NO, IT'S GOTTA BE HERE
SOMEWHERE.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.578
- WHY DID I EVER SIGN OFF
ON ALEC'S STUPID IDEA?

11:44.662 --> 11:46.622
- NOWHERE
IN MY SO-CALLED IDEA--

11:46.705 --> 11:48.916
- THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME
TO BLAME ALEC LATER.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.334
RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY

11:50.418 --> 11:52.128
TO KEEP VICTORIA
IN THE LADIES' ROOM

11:52.211 --> 11:54.130
SO WE CAN FIND THE RING.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.427
- WAIT! HOW'RE WE GONNA
KEEP HER IN THERE?

11:59.510 --> 12:01.303
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.972
VICTORIA'S VERY EMOTIONAL
RIGHT NOW.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.223
EVERYTHING MAKES HER CRY.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.059
- THAT'S IT!

12:07.143 --> 12:09.979
- WHAT WAS THAT CLAPPING?
IS THE PRESS HERE?

12:10.062 --> 12:11.981
HOW DO I LOOK?
- AW.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.315
WELL, AT THE RISK
OF RUINING YOUR MAKEUP,

12:13.399 --> 12:16.152
YOU LOOK LIKE THE LUCKIEST WOMAN
IN THE WORLD.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.155
- OH, I AM, AREN'T I?
I HAVE DEAR FRIENDS AND--

12:19.238 --> 12:21.323
AND A WONDERFUL MAN
WHO LOVES ME.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.783
- AND HE'S RICH TOO.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.994
- SO RICH.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.163
OH, I'VE GOTTA REDO
MY MASCARA.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.124
- GOTTA GO.

12:34.753 --> 12:38.299
- CONGRATS AGAIN.
- GO AWAY.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.509
- OH, NO!

12:41.927 --> 12:43.387
THE RING COULD BE
IN ANY ONE OF THESE!

12:43.471 --> 12:46.307
- START DIGGING.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.855
- MM. IT'S A FANTASY OF MINE
TO BE FORCED TO EAT CHOCOLATE.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.524
I AM BEING FORCED, RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

12:55.608 --> 12:59.028
WE'RE DOING THIS FOR A FRIEND.
WE'RE HEROES.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.072
- OH, MY GOD!
IT'S A DIAMOND!

13:02.156 --> 13:05.034
- WAIT, IT MIGHT NOT BE OURS.
- IT'S HUGE!

13:05.117 --> 13:07.536
- IT'S OURS.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.830
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU FINALLY ASKED ME.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.874
- UH, BRENDA, I, UH--

13:11.957 --> 13:14.710
- UM, BRENDA, UH, I THINK
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY

13:14.793 --> 13:16.378
IS THERE'S BEEN
A LITTLE MISTAKE.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.047
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"MISTAKE"?

13:18.130 --> 13:21.217
- THAT RING WASN'T
ACTUALLY MEANT FOR YOU.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.010
- BUT YOU TWO SEEM LIKE
SUCH A GREAT COUPLE.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.887
I'M SURE THERE'S A PROPOSAL
IN YOUR FUTURE.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.222
- WHEN?

13:26.305 --> 13:28.432
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
17 YEARS.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.519
- 17 YEARS?

13:31.602 --> 13:34.688
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

13:34.772 --> 13:36.023
STILL NOT SURE?

13:36.106 --> 13:37.233
STILL DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S THE ONE?

13:37.316 --> 13:38.734
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

13:38.817 --> 13:40.903
- BUT YOU AGREED THAT MARRIAGE
IS JUST A PIECE OF PAPER.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.614
YOU SAID YOU LIKED BEING LIKE
GOLDIE HAWN AND KURT RUSSELL.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.116
- OH, ALL WOMEN SAY THAT.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.785
NONE OF THEM
ACTUALLY MEAN IT.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.578
- GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.373
THIS WAS SUCH A PERFECT NIGHT
FOR HIM TO PROPOSE.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.125
- OH, SWEETIE.
- [crying]

13:55.209 --> 13:58.963
AND I'M EVEN WEARING
MY GRANDMOTHER'S ANTIQUE BLOUSE.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.890
YES, IT'S-IT'S--
IT'S DELICATE.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.357
- THANK YOU.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.234
- YOU DESERVE BETTER
THAN THIS GUY.

14:20.317 --> 14:23.279
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DO!

14:23.362 --> 14:27.116
TWO WORDS I NOW REALIZE
I AM NEVER GONNA SAY TO YOU.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.118
- BRENDA, WAIT!

14:29.201 --> 14:31.287
- LET HER GO, KURT RUSSELL,
LET HER GO.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.539
- LET'S GET VICTORIA.

14:33.622 --> 14:37.084
- HEY, EMMET, HEADS UP.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.461
- OH, FORGET ALL THIS
GIMMICKY DESSERT BUSINESS.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.840
I'M JUST GONNA BE IN THE MOMENT,
SPEAK FROM THE HEART.

14:42.923 --> 14:46.302
I'LL OPEN THE BOX AND SAY,
"YOUR SOUL COMPLETES ME.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.803
BE MINE FOREVER."

14:47.886 --> 14:50.806
- [shrieks]

14:53.934 --> 14:57.229
- WOW!
EMMET LAWSON'S PROPOSING!

14:57.313 --> 15:00.316
TO A DUDE.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.446
[clapping]

15:05.529 --> 15:06.655
- WHY DID YOU SQUEAL?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.324
- I SAW A MOUSE!

15:08.407 --> 15:09.658
YOU WOULD'VE
DONE THE SAME THING

15:09.742 --> 15:13.495
IF A TIGER SCURRIED
ALONG THE FLOOR!

15:13.579 --> 15:15.623
- YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.374
- WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU
SO MUCH.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.501
- OH, STOP!

15:19.585 --> 15:22.963
YOU KNOW WHEN OTHER PEOPLE CRY
I MIRROR CRY.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.090
AND IT'S ONLY GONNA BE
FOR THREE MONTHS.

15:26.967 --> 15:30.095
- THAT'S RIGHT.
JUST THREE MONTHS.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.848
- ALL RIGHT, NOW,
NO MORE SAD FACES.

15:32.931 --> 15:34.350
THE PRESS
IS GONNA BE HERE SOON,

15:34.433 --> 15:36.477
AND I WANT THE REST
OF THIS NIGHT TO GO SMOOTHLY.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.521
[excited chatter outside]

15:39.605 --> 15:41.482
HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING
OUT THERE?

15:41.565 --> 15:43.025
- PEOPLE ARE GOING CRAZY.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.070
IT TURNS OUT
EMMET LAWSON IS GAY.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.872
- EMMET...

15:56.955 --> 15:59.833
WHAT IS THIS
ABOUT YOU BEING GAY?

15:59.917 --> 16:01.210
- VICTORIA, SIT DOWN.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.211
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.712
- OH, DEAR GOD.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.715
I KNEW IT WAS TOO GOOD
TO BE TRUE.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.884
I SAW THE WAY
YOU WERE LOOKING AT ALEC

16:08.967 --> 16:12.262
AS HE SASHAYED
ACROSS THE FLOOR.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.184
- VICTORIA,
I'VE SPENT THE LAST FEW DAYS

16:17.267 --> 16:19.269
REHEARSING THE PERFECT LINES
TO SAY AT THIS MOMENT.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.896
BUT NOW THAT IT'S HERE,

16:20.979 --> 16:23.649
ALL I CAN THINK OF
TO SAY IS...

16:23.732 --> 16:25.401
I LOVE YOU.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.069
I LOVE YOU
WITH ALL MY HEART,

16:27.152 --> 16:29.071
AND I WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.406
- OH, EMMET.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.408
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.535
- VICTORIA CHASE,

16:34.618 --> 16:36.453
WILL YOU--
- U.S. TREASURY AGENTS.

16:36.537 --> 16:40.874
EMMET LAWSON, YOU ARE
UNDER ARREST FOR TAX FRAUD.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.292
- WHAT!

16:42.376 --> 16:43.711
- YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.422
THIS IS SIR EMMET LAWSON,
THE ACTOR.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.927
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
TAX FRAUD?

16:52.010 --> 16:53.429
- YES.
- I DON'T EVEN DO MY TAXES.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.264
SPEAK TO
MY BUSINESS MANAGER.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.724
HE WAS ARRESTED
AT THE AIRPORT,

16:56.807 --> 16:58.267
WHICH IS WHY YOU'VE
BEEN DEEMED A FLIGHT RISK.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.601
- A FLIGHT RISK?

16:59.685 --> 17:02.730
BUT WE'RE LEAVING FOR MOROCCO
IN THE MORNING.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.731
- YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.191
- OH, HE WILL BE SILENT
IN A SECOND, I PROMISE.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.611
BUT PLEASE, PLEASE JUST LET HIM
FINISH SOMETHING FIRST.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.571
- YOU SURE YOU WANT ME TO?
I'M BEING ARRESTED.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.156
I WOULD UNDERSTAND
IF YOU WANT TO POSTPONE THIS.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.242
- MY ANSWER
IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE.

17:17.368 --> 17:20.622
- VICTORIA CHASE,
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

17:20.705 --> 17:23.625
- OF COURSE.
I LOVE YOU.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.421
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

17:27.503 --> 17:28.964
- [gasps]

17:29.048 --> 17:31.675
- I'M SORRY, THIS IS PROPERTY
OF THE GOVERNMENT NOW.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.180
- IT IS STUNNING THOUGH,
MA'AM.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.307
YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE A MAN
WHO WANTS TO COMMIT.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.354
- NOT NOW, AGENT TANAKA.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.860
- DARLING, I DO APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS APPALLING PROPOSAL.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.987
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:52.070 --> 17:55.741
THIS IS THE BEST PROPOSAL
I HAVE EVER HAD.

17:58.202 --> 18:01.038
- MY IDEA.

18:11.089 --> 18:12.841
- [sighs]

18:12.925 --> 18:14.718
WELL, IT'S ALL A BIG MESS.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.512
EMMET GOT DUPED
BY HIS BUSINESS MANAGER

18:16.595 --> 18:19.515
AND BLINDLY SIGNED PAPERS
FOR SOME SHADY DEALS.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.683
NOW THEY WON'T EVEN
LET HIM OUT ON BAIL.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.061
- OH, VICTORIA,
I'M SO SORRY.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.355
- THEY WANNA MAKE
A CELEBRITY EXAMPLE OUT OF HIM,

18:26.438 --> 18:28.190
LIKE MARTHA STEWART.

18:28.273 --> 18:32.486
- BUT HE'S NOT TOUGH
LIKE SHE IS.

18:32.569 --> 18:36.824
HE CAN'T CARVE A GOURD
INTO A JAPANESE THROWING STAR.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.743
- LOOK, EMMET IS VERY TOUGH.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.663
HE LIVED WITH WOLVES.
HE LIVED WITH ANNE HECHE.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.749
HE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.085
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.546
HE COULD SPEND
THE NEXT TEN YEARS IN JAIL.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.214
OH, MY GOD.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.383
WHEN HE GETS OUT,
I'LL BE OLD.

18:54.466 --> 18:59.346
- RELAX, THAT'D BE TRUE
IF HE GOT OUT TOMORROW.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.558
- ELKA, WE'RE TRYING
TO STAY POSITIVE.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.060
- HONEY, IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.896
- ACTUALLY, YES.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.107
FOR JUST ONE MOMENT,
COULD WE PRETEND

19:10.190 --> 19:12.025
THAT THE ONLY THING
THAT HAPPENED TONIGHT IS...

19:12.109 --> 19:13.318
I GOT ENGAGED!

19:13.402 --> 19:15.362
- YES, YOU DID!
- CONGRATULATIONS.

19:15.445 --> 19:18.782
- WELL, AS LONG AS WE'RE
PRETENDING EVERYTHING'S OKAY,

19:18.866 --> 19:20.075
LET'S HAVE SOME
OF THAT CHOCOLATE MOUSSE

19:20.158 --> 19:22.578
YOU BROUGHT HOME.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.915
- WHAT'S THAT LUMP?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.876
- OH, NO.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.795
ANOTHER RING?

19:31.879 --> 19:33.255
- KEEP EATING!

19:33.338 --> 19:37.718
IT'S GOTTA BE
IN THERE SOMEWHERE!

19:41.013 --> 19:43.932
IT'S GONNA BE WORTH IT.
