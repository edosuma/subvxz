00:02.035 --> 00:03.636
( bell rings )

00:03.670 --> 00:06.939
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.973 --> 00:09.876
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.909 --> 00:12.812
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:16.383
  <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
  <i>just in time to</i>
  <i>see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.416 --> 00:19.953
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:25.025
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.058 --> 00:27.994
  <i>* And my dog ate</i>
  <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:30.930
 <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>

00:30.964 --> 00:34.634

00:34.668 --> 00:38.471
 <i>* It's all right</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:55.822
  <i>* It's all right</i>

<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:17.143 --> 01:19.079
   This week is the annual
   Sweetheart Dance,

01:19.079 --> 01:21.081
when a guy gives
away his heart.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.583
 And guess who I want
 to give my heart to?

01:23.616 --> 01:26.186
 I'll give you a clue.
 It ain't him.

01:28.621 --> 01:31.891
 Kelly, will you go
 to
 the Sweetheart Dance with me?

01:33.860 --> 01:37.130
I think it's time
for a heart transplant.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.568
 She's going with me.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.571
   Who are you kidding,
   Preppie?

01:44.604 --> 01:46.773
You won't be going
to that dance.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.242
 He's in big trouble
 with Belding.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.777
 What'd you do, Zack?

01:50.810 --> 01:53.480
 He dumped teabags
 in the swimming pool.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.615
  It was my history project.

01:55.648 --> 01:59.119
   You never heard
   of the Boston Tea Party?

01:59.119 --> 02:03.189
 Then he erased the blackboards
 with Mr. Fetterman's toupee.

02:03.223 --> 02:07.060
   I think he looks better
   with white hair.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.662
 I'm telling you, Kelly,
 Preppie's dead meat.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.631
  Tomorrow Belding's
  having a conference

02:11.664 --> 02:13.133
   with him and his mother.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.101
Hey, don't listen
to him, Kelly.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.672
   There's nothing
   going to stop me
   from going to that dance.

02:18.705 --> 02:21.141
 I guess I can wait
 another day before deciding.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.543
 ( pop music playing )

02:23.576 --> 02:25.879
   <i>* Where are you going? *</i>

02:27.113 --> 02:28.982
  Hey, Kelly, I got the new
  Bo Revere tape.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.618
   I love Bo Revere.
   He's my favorite.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.521
 ( music continuing )

02:34.554 --> 02:37.190
 Lisa, we're going
 to
 the Sweetheart Dance together.

02:37.223 --> 02:40.660
  - Over my dead body.
  - Love does not
  give up so easily.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.096
Screech, why don't
you find someone else?

02:50.837 --> 02:53.540
   Well, at least this Screech
   is easier to get rid of.

02:56.142 --> 02:58.111
I shall return.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.048
  Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:02.048 --> 03:04.951
You know the rules.
No music in the halls.

03:05.051 --> 03:07.053
 Mr. Belding,
 that's Bo Revere's new single.

03:07.053 --> 03:08.688
 It's number
 eight with a bullet.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.758
 Too bad the bullet missed him.
 ( laughs )

03:11.791 --> 03:13.660
What's your idea
of good music?

03:13.693 --> 03:15.228
    The Beach Boys,
   <i>California Girls.</i>

03:15.261 --> 03:18.798
   What a coincidence.
   Hey, that's my favorite.

03:18.832 --> 03:22.936
Zack, I'm not a straw--
don't suck up.

03:22.969 --> 03:26.072
   We're still meeting tomorrow
   with my favorite
   California girl,

03:26.072 --> 03:29.175
   your mommy.
   ( hums <i>California Girls )</i>

03:31.244 --> 03:33.780
  What a beautiful color,
  thank you so much.

03:33.813 --> 03:36.082
  And for the apple.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.885
 Ever since yesterday,
 I wanted to bring you flowers.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.755
  What a lovely bouquet.
  Thank you, Jessie.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.693
  Oh, my favorite candy, Tommy.
  How sweet.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.765
 - Here, Miss Wentworth.
 - Lovely apple, Zack.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.199
Well, you know
the old saying,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.969
 ''An apple a day
 might get me an A.''

03:57.103 --> 04:00.674
I think that would take
a whole orchard, Zack.

04:00.707 --> 04:03.610
  Okay class, today we are
  going to talk about

04:03.643 --> 04:05.645
subliminal advertising.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.846
 What's that?

04:06.880 --> 04:09.849
 It's advertising that uses
 hidden messages.

04:09.883 --> 04:14.721
Hidden messages aren't new.
I pass those to
girls every day.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.890
And every day
we flush them.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.094
 All right.
 You know that theater owners

04:21.127 --> 04:23.063
   have used hidden messages

04:23.096 --> 04:25.699
   by flashing
   a picture of popcorn
   in the middle of a movie.

04:25.732 --> 04:28.168
 - Does it work?
 - Well, let's say that sales

04:28.201 --> 04:30.170
really started popping.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.305
   Oh, come on.
   You think that I would
   run out and buy something

04:32.339 --> 04:34.674
just because of some
hidden message?

04:34.708 --> 04:37.277
   You all did.
   Remember that
   lovely music tape

04:37.310 --> 04:38.912
  I played for you yesterday?

04:38.945 --> 04:40.780
 It contained hidden messages

04:40.814 --> 04:43.383
  asking for flowers, candy
  and apples.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.785
That's ridiculous,
Miss Wentworth.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.388
   What do you take us for,
   mindless robots?

04:48.421 --> 04:51.224
 Nev-- never, Screech.

04:51.257 --> 04:55.295
 - How do you do that?
 - It's simple. Gather 'round.

04:55.328 --> 04:58.331
  Listen closely to the tape
  I played for you yesterday.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.400
 ( soft music plays )

05:02.202 --> 05:04.304
   Now you'll only
   hear the messages

05:04.337 --> 05:06.272
   when I take out
   the music

05:06.306 --> 05:08.775
   and turn up
   the voice track.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.944
  <i>Bring your favorite teacher,</i>
  <i>Miss Wentworth,</i>

05:11.044 --> 05:14.681
  <i>apples and candy to eat.</i>
  <i>She also loves</i>
  <i>beautiful flowers.</i>

05:14.714 --> 05:18.084
 <i>And if any of</i>
 <i>you have a handsome</i>
 <i>single parent, I'm available.</i>

05:19.386 --> 05:21.688
  <i>Bring your favorite teacher,</i>
  <i>Miss Wentworth,</i>

05:21.721 --> 05:24.290
   <i>apples and candy to eat.</i>

05:24.324 --> 05:26.292
 This is amazing!
 Does it always work?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.428
   It usually is effective
   for a few hours.

05:28.461 --> 05:31.164
 But remember,
 it doesn't work on everyone.

05:31.197 --> 05:32.899
  And there are always minds

05:32.932 --> 05:35.168
that get the messages
a bit mixed up.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.372
   Zack,
   what if Belding finds out

05:39.406 --> 05:41.675
 we're giving him a tape
 with hidden messages?

05:41.708 --> 05:45.078
He's not going to find out.
They're hidden.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.213
  Besides,
  it's my only hope.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.149
 I've got to keep Belding
 away from my mother.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.085
 Don't worry, Zack.
 She'll never fall for Belding.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.820
She loves your father.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.256
No, you idiot.

05:56.289 --> 06:00.860
 Look, if Belding meets
 my mother, I'll be grounded.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.696
 All right,
 is everything set up?

06:02.729 --> 06:06.032
Yep. <i>California Girls</i> tape
is in this machine.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.301
 I'll record your voice,
 and then
 we'll mix them both together.

06:08.335 --> 06:11.037
   - So where's the microphone?
   - It's hidden!

06:11.371 --> 06:13.406
  Ow!

06:13.440 --> 06:16.676
 Okay, Screech,
 get ready to record my voice.

06:20.347 --> 06:23.049
 Zack brainwashing Belding,
 take one.

06:25.251 --> 06:28.822
  Zack Morris is a good kid.

06:28.855 --> 06:33.259
 - Zack Morris is
 a great student.
   - ( scoffs )

06:33.293 --> 06:36.463
  Zack Morris is
  a fine human being.

06:37.797 --> 06:41.334
 Zack Morris is the son
 I never had.

06:41.368 --> 06:44.170
  You're Belding's son?!
  I never knew that.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.323
 Have you guys
 seen Screech?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.158
   Yeah, I saw him
   in the cafeteria.

07:05.191 --> 07:08.028
  He was making an
  egg salad sculpture of you.

07:09.295 --> 07:11.798
 He has been hounding me
 to go to the dance with him.

07:11.831 --> 07:14.834
Everywhere I go
he's chasing me
with that silly heart.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.203
I finally got
away from him.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.338
 Guess again.

07:19.839 --> 07:22.409
( screams )
I'm not safe anywhere.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.917
   Mr. Belding,
   I have a present for you.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.553
  - Beach Boys,
  ''California Girls.''
  - I already have that tape.

07:33.586 --> 07:36.289
Not in the new
enhanced Dolby version.

07:36.322 --> 07:38.258
Well, thank you, Zack.
My tape is rather old.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.393
  - Play it a lot, sir.
  - I will.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.962
  But you're not
  off the hook, bub.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.303
   See, what did I
   tell you, Kelly?

07:50.337 --> 07:52.439
 Preppie can't go
 to the dance.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.108
 Okay, Slater.
 I'll wear your heart.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.079
   Oh, come-- Kelly.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.082
Oh, come on, Kelly.
You can't go with him.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.386
 Ahh!

08:08.221 --> 08:12.258
   <i>* I wish they all could</i>
   <i>be California girls... *</i>

08:12.292 --> 08:14.294
  - ( knocking )
  - Come in.

08:15.628 --> 08:18.465
 Hello, Zack.
 You're late.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.034
  Where is your mother?
  She is supposed to be here.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.704
My mother?
I told her not to come.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.540
 You told your mother
 not to come?

08:28.274 --> 08:29.609
 Yes.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.911
  Who cares?
  Zack Morris is a good kid.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.813
 I was hoping
 you'd say that, sir.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.951
   Now, Zack, this is very
   serious business.

08:38.051 --> 08:41.821
 Mr. Testaverde said that you
 dumped teabags into
 the swimming pool.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.057
 - Do you believe him, sir?
 - Of course not.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.060
  Zack Morris is
  a fine human being.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.864
 Now, Zack, your math and
 science teachers say
 you're getting D's.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.632
  I don't believe that, sir.

08:52.665 --> 08:55.535
   Neither do I.
   Zack Morris is
   a great student.

08:56.636 --> 08:57.937
Will that be all, sir?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.006
  I'll decide when this
  meeting is over, young man.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.008
There's one other thing
I have to say.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.043
   There is?

09:04.177 --> 09:06.579
 Zack Morris is
 the son I never had.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.016
 Have a good time
 at the dance.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.785
 Here's 10 bucks, son.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.021
 Thanks, Dad.

09:15.021 --> 09:18.725
<i>* I wish they all could be</i>
<i>California girls *</i>

09:20.593 --> 09:22.696
If this works
on principals,

09:22.729 --> 09:24.564
why can't it
work on girls?

09:31.905 --> 09:35.041
 Hey, Screech, did you give out
 the tapes with
 the hidden messages?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.911
 I gave one to every dork, nerd
 and geek at Bayside

09:37.944 --> 09:39.346
 to use on their
 dream girls.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.082
 All right. Let's see
 how it works.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.223
   Hello, Clarissa.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.893
Hi Edgar.
Thanks for that tape.
It's my favorite song.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.329
   I knew you'd like it.
   ( gasping laugh )

09:58.932 --> 10:00.266
 Will you go
 to the dance with me?

10:00.300 --> 10:03.103
Oh Edgar, I'm just thrilled
you're not taken.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.375
   We're golden.
   It works.

10:08.408 --> 10:11.778
  I'm not sure, Zack.
  Edgar's a pretty cool guy.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.081
  He's ''All-city'' in chess.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.826
Alan Fairbanks!

10:29.496 --> 10:32.866
I have been ignoring
you since second grade.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.201
  Uh, I know.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.170
 Buffy, did you get
 the tape I sent you?

10:37.203 --> 10:39.939
 Yes, let's go steady.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.783
  Waitress! Waitress!

10:50.984 --> 10:52.485
What can I get you,
master?

10:52.519 --> 10:54.921
 I'm sure you
 know by now.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.398
  Oh, Screech, this is great!

11:05.432 --> 11:07.834
   Kelly and Lisa are
   going to be ours forever.

11:07.867 --> 11:11.071
  I don't know. What if Wendell
  and Edgar get there first?

11:11.071 --> 11:14.941
   We're sending them
   tapes about us, you simp.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.711
 All you've got to do is switch
 our Bo Revere tapes

11:17.744 --> 11:20.847
 with the ones in Kelly
 and Lisa's cassette players.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.716
 - Got 'em right here.
 - All right.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.118
   Did you check the one
   I made for Kelly?

11:25.151 --> 11:28.388
 Yep. Listened
 to it 10 times. Zack?

11:28.421 --> 11:30.957
  - Yeah?
  - Will you go to
  the dance with me?

11:41.835 --> 11:43.169
  Kelly and Lisa: Hi.

11:49.175 --> 11:51.544
   You seem lost.
   Are you new here?

11:51.578 --> 11:55.281
  ( high voice )
  Uh, yes. I'm new all over.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.283
   I'm Jessie,
   what's your name?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.819
My name?
Uh... Barbara.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.788
 Barbara Bush.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.060
  Well, Barbara,
  we'd better change.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.462
 You can't play soccer in that.
 You need a uniform.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.331
( whimpering )
Well, I don't have one.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.367
Don't be upset.
I'll get you one.
What size do you wear?

12:14.401 --> 12:16.536
 I don't know.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.072
  - You look like a petite.
  - Thank you.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.373
  I'll be right back.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.851
 Jessie: Okay, Barbara,
 I found one!

12:37.424 --> 12:39.125
   Barbara?

12:39.159 --> 12:41.094
 Barbara Bush?

12:42.162 --> 12:43.997
   What a weird little girl.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.099
 Zack, I am so glad
 I found you.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.101
I have to talk
to you.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.104
 Oh. I wonder what
 it could be?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.473
   I don't want to go
   to the dance with Slater.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.508
 What?

12:55.542 --> 12:57.944
Listen, it gets better.

12:57.977 --> 13:00.547
  I suddenly realized how
  much I care for you, Zack.

13:00.580 --> 13:05.085
   Please rescue me from
   this muscle-bound monkey.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.888
   Kelly, how can you say that?
   You're wearing my heart.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.890
  This thing?
  Who cares?

13:11.458 --> 13:12.959
Kelly!

13:13.059 --> 13:15.295
  Please say you'll go
  to the dance with me, Zack?

13:15.328 --> 13:17.464
Okay, I'll go with you.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.306
  Has anyone seen
  my Screech?

13:26.339 --> 13:28.074
   Screech:
   I'm in here, my darling.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.077
   Come out,
   my handsome hunk.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.550
  Your hunk is here.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.887
 I want you to be
 my sweetheart for the dance.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.423
 - Are you sure?
 - lf you look at anyone else,

13:43.456 --> 13:46.526
  I'll die.
  Don't torture me anymore,
  my manly mustang.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.996
Okay, I'll go.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.898
  At last, he's mine!

13:57.637 --> 14:00.106
Jessie. Jessie!

14:02.175 --> 14:05.111
  Keep listening to tapes,
  you'll put
  my jukebox out of business.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.847
I'm sorry, Max, but this is
the new Bo Revere tape.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.850
  They were all sold out
  so I had to borrow Kelly's.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.520
  I see you're going
  to the dance
  with Steve Lawson.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.556
 Yeah, but I think I'd have
 a better time if
 I went with Zack.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.558
 Zack?

14:18.591 --> 14:21.494
 He's the kind of boy
 every girl dreams of.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.364
   Great looking,
   smart and funny.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.366
   Yes, that's Zack Morris.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.503
Something crazy's
going on here.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.112
Jessie.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.980
  Jessie!
  Guess what?

14:41.081 --> 14:43.116
 Screech said he'd go
 to the dance with me.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.218
 Lisa, are you talking
 about Screech

14:45.251 --> 14:47.287
  as in, ''Get lost, creep''?

14:47.320 --> 14:50.390
  You're just jealous.
  Tiger man is a great catch.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.093
   Look what I got.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.661
   I thought you were going
   with Slater?

14:54.694 --> 14:57.297
   I was until l knew
   I could go with my Zack.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.333
 He's the kind of boy
 every girl dreams of.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.136
   Great looking,
   smart and funny.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.071
   Yes, that's Zack Morris.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.274
 What's going on here?

15:08.308 --> 15:12.045
 Yeah, we each had dates,
 now we're fighting over Zack?

15:23.289 --> 15:26.426
 Something weird's going
 on here, like Bayside's
been brainwashed.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.329
You think someone's been
playing with our minds?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.600
Wait a second.

15:33.633 --> 15:37.303
Miss Wentworth's class?
Subliminal advertising?

15:37.337 --> 15:40.640
I wonder if someone's using
hidden messages on us.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.475
  Not my Screechie?!

15:42.509 --> 15:44.978
   He's the buffest
   bronco on earth.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.449
   Wait a second,
   what am I saying?

15:50.316 --> 15:51.618
 Zack!

15:51.651 --> 15:54.120
   I bet he did it
   with this Bo Revere tape.

15:54.154 --> 15:57.323
But how? The tapes were
never out of our hands.

15:57.357 --> 16:00.727
   Except during
   soccer practice.

16:00.760 --> 16:05.398
Hold on, there was this
strange little girl in
   the locker room.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.566
   Yeah, we saw her.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.035
  Just think about it, okay.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.637
Take off the glasses...

16:12.706 --> 16:14.374
 And the long hair...

16:16.376 --> 16:18.144
   And the dress...

16:23.650 --> 16:25.552
   You don't have a Barbara,

16:25.585 --> 16:27.320
  you have a Screech.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.256
  And wherever there's
  a Screech, there's a Zack.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.192
 This is war.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.527
  Ow!

16:39.499 --> 16:42.635
   Zack's voice: <i>Zack Morris is</i>
  <i>a blond Tom Cruise.</i>

16:43.503 --> 16:45.739
 <i>Zack Morris is a 10.</i>

16:45.772 --> 16:47.741
   Two fives
   is more like it.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.944
 I'm stuck with a three,
 with seven left over.

16:50.977 --> 16:54.748
 <i>Zack Morris is</i>
 <i>perfect in every way.</i>

16:54.781 --> 16:57.917
  He certainly has a high
  opinion of himself.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.652
  He brainwashed me.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.022
You? I was so
mean to Slater.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.424
 I dumped him
 in front of everyone.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.459
  You? What about me?

17:06.492 --> 17:08.595
 I begged Screech
 to be my sweetheart.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.897
  I'm going to be in counseling
  the rest of my life.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.733
Zack took advantage
of my classroom

17:13.767 --> 17:16.036
so he could be the most
popular boy in school.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.438
 - I think you should bust him.
 - Oh, no.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.839
  Bust the blond
  Tom Cruise? Never.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.612
We're going to give him
exactly what he wants.

17:28.882 --> 17:32.352
  And that concludes our lesson
  on subliminal advertising.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.422
  - Have you found
  it interesting?
  - Oh, yes, Miss Wentworth.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.124
It's changed
my whole life.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.560
   I'll bet it has.

17:40.593 --> 17:44.597
  Now, does anyone
  have any questions
  before we move on? Jessie.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.533
 Have governments ever
 used these techniques

17:46.566 --> 17:47.967
to control the thoughts
of people?

17:48.068 --> 17:49.736
  Well, there have
  been cases.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.472
Does it ever backfire?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.808
  I'm so glad you
  asked that.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.510
   During an election in Italy,
   the ruling party

17:57.544 --> 18:00.113
   placed hidden messages
   in the pizza commercials.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.816
  So what happened?
  Did they eat the candidate?

18:02.849 --> 18:07.087
 No, no,
 but they rioted and sliced
 him into twelve equal pieces.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.456
You can never be sure
of the effects

18:09.489 --> 18:11.858
  when you play
  with people's minds, Zack.

18:11.891 --> 18:15.028
<i>Attention,</i>
<i>students, this is your</i>
<i>principal, Mr. Belding,</i>

18:15.028 --> 18:17.097
<i>inviting you to take</i>
<i>a break from learning.</i>

18:17.130 --> 18:19.132
  ( cheers )
  All right!

18:19.165 --> 18:21.368
To help make school
more enjoyable,

18:21.401 --> 18:23.570
 we're going to play
 a hit song every day.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.606
 I want to thank Kelly Kapowski
 for lending us her tape.

18:28.742 --> 18:30.043
  ( pop music plays )

18:30.043 --> 18:32.379
 <i>Where are you going?</i>

18:34.447 --> 18:37.083
 <i>Where have you been?</i>

18:38.618 --> 18:41.054
 <i>You don't have</i>
 <i>to tell me...</i>

18:41.054 --> 18:44.124
 Zack, I love you.
 You're perfect in every way.

18:45.759 --> 18:47.193
 Jessie, what are you saying?

18:47.227 --> 18:50.063
 I'm saying
 Zack Morris is a 10.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.865
   Jessie, sit down.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.633
 Take me to the dance.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.769
   You're everything
   a girl dreams of.

18:58.772 --> 19:00.473
   Is everything
   all right, Zack?

19:00.507 --> 19:03.043
  Oh, yes, Miss Wentworth,
  everything's fine.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.845
- Go to
the dance with me, Zack.
- I'm going with Kelly.

19:05.879 --> 19:09.015
- No, you're going with me.
- Keep your hand off him.
He's mine.

19:09.049 --> 19:12.452
  - Get your hands off me.
  - Girls: Zack! Zack! Zack!

19:12.485 --> 19:14.020
Miss Wentworth, you've
got to help me!

19:14.020 --> 19:18.024
   Oh, you don't need any help,
   you blond Tom Cruise.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.026
   What, is everybody crazy?

19:20.060 --> 19:21.828
  They're crazy
  about you, Top Gun.

19:21.861 --> 19:25.498
   Girls:
   Zack! Zack! Zack!

19:27.867 --> 19:29.836
  Whoa, Jeez.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.505
 ( music continuing )

19:33.039 --> 19:34.908
There you are.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.110
You're so cute
I could scream.

19:38.078 --> 19:39.212
 I am?

19:39.245 --> 19:41.548
 I thought Screech was
 my Prince of Passion,

19:41.581 --> 19:43.917
 but it's you, Z-man.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.855
Take your
hands off him!

19:48.888 --> 19:51.858
 - He is mine.
 - Yeah, you tell her.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.494
 - Zack! Zack! Zack!
 - Zack: Kelly! Kelly!

19:54.527 --> 19:56.529
 Wait, Kelly!

19:56.563 --> 19:58.565
  ( all shouting )
  Zack! Zack!

20:02.669 --> 20:05.138
 Hey! All right,
 just leave him alone!

20:05.171 --> 20:07.741
  Slater, am I glad to see you!
  Keep them away.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.977
  All right, just back off!
  Back off.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.882
 He's going
 to the dance with me.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.061
Mr. Belding, you've got
to turn this tape off!

20:28.094 --> 20:29.829
  Zack, it's radical.

20:29.863 --> 20:32.565
 - ( music stops )
 - Mr. Belding,
 you don't understand.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.168
I placed hidden messages
in that Bo Revere tape.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.870
   Now everybody
   wants me.

20:36.903 --> 20:41.574
Come on,
Zack, that's ridiculous.
You don't think that--

20:41.608 --> 20:45.879
  Has anyone ever told you,
  you look like
  a blond Tom Cruise?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.914
 Oh, no, not you, too.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.983
 There's something
 I'd like you to have.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.254
  Hello, sweetheart.

20:54.287 --> 20:57.924
   ( all shouting )
   Zack! Zack! Zack!

20:57.957 --> 21:00.660
Please stop loving me!

21:00.694 --> 21:02.262
   Isn't that what
   you wanted, Zack?

21:02.295 --> 21:06.666
I think this Bo Revere tape
belongs to you, Zack.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.168
  But what about
  that tape?

21:08.201 --> 21:10.837
   There are no hidden messages
   on this tape, Zack.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.973
 I bought it at
 The Spinning Lizard.

21:14.074 --> 21:15.775
 You mean you guys
 were all in on this?

21:15.809 --> 21:18.745
 You got it,
 you fine human being.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.649
That's right,
we all got together
to teach you a lesson.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.684
  Well, I guess I learned it.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.286
  Sorry we had
  to be so inventive,

21:26.319 --> 21:29.089
   but some students
   are just harder to reach.

21:29.089 --> 21:33.893
By the way,
''son I never had,''
you owe me $10.

21:33.927 --> 21:36.930
 You can pay me tomorrow
 when we meet with your mommy.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.932
  Crash landing, ''Top Gun.''

21:46.306 --> 21:49.209
 ( instrumental music playing )
