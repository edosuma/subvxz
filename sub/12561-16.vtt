WEBVTT

00:02.481 --> 00:06.896
I miss you, Hank.
I really miss you.

00:06.897 --> 00:08.398
I miss you too.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.601
What are you doing here?

00:11.602 --> 00:12.602
Well, not what you were
going to be doing.

00:12.603 --> 00:13.736
I'll tell you that.

00:13.737 --> 00:15.872
I knew you were seeing her.

00:15.873 --> 00:19.075
It was just different...
Me seeing her.

00:19.076 --> 00:20.677
We're just friends.

00:20.678 --> 00:23.279
I think there were
unresolved feelings there.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.181
On both sides.

00:25.182 --> 00:26.716
This is me.
This is what you get.

00:26.717 --> 00:28.051
It's not enough for me.

00:28.052 --> 00:30.420
It's not what I want.
I'm sorry.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.287
Is this an arranged marriage?

00:32.289 --> 00:33.322
What if she gets engaged
and moves to London?

00:33.323 --> 00:34.490
What are we gonna do?

00:34.491 --> 00:35.658
Will you return to the Hamptons

00:35.659 --> 00:37.794
next summer
to work for Hankmed?

00:37.795 --> 00:39.796
I don't know.

00:39.797 --> 00:41.631
I don't know is not a no.

00:41.632 --> 00:43.199
So I have
an on-the-record maybe.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.868
Good.

00:45.869 --> 00:47.970
Today in the northeast

00:47.971 --> 00:49.672
we are going to see
plenty of sunshine,

00:49.673 --> 00:51.841
with the high pressure
dominating

00:51.842 --> 00:54.243
and really comfortable
temperatures.

00:54.244 --> 00:56.713
But enjoy it,
because a storm system

00:56.714 --> 00:58.381
is headed our way.

00:58.382 --> 00:59.849
We won't see
too much of it tonight,

00:59.850 --> 01:02.185
but we'll be looking
for some severe thunderstorms

01:02.186 --> 01:06.622
in our area later this week.

01:06.623 --> 01:11.227
And as the junior explorer
rounded the dark corner,

01:11.228 --> 01:14.263
he came face-to-face
with...

01:14.264 --> 01:19.869
The rule zombie.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.871
And the rule zombie,

01:21.872 --> 01:26.242
he looked at him
with great disappointment.

01:26.243 --> 01:29.779
And he warned him about not
observing the buddy system,

01:29.780 --> 01:34.183
about wandering
off the designated trail.

01:34.184 --> 01:35.818
Remember when we were
talking about the...

01:35.819 --> 01:38.988
the... the...

01:40.858 --> 01:42.225
Looks like
that storm system's coming in.

01:42.226 --> 01:47.697
So we gotta split up
and take cover.

01:47.698 --> 01:50.233
Explorer chaperones, you too.

01:50.234 --> 01:52.935
Yeah.

01:52.936 --> 01:57.573
I'm just... I gotta...

01:57.574 --> 02:00.276
okay.

02:00.277 --> 02:01.911
- Can I come in?
- No.

02:01.912 --> 02:03.713
Full tent, huh?

02:03.714 --> 02:06.616
I'm sure there's room
for one more.

02:08.185 --> 02:11.053
Hey, chip, you know
the best thing about nature?

02:11.054 --> 02:14.257
No fluorescent lighting?

02:14.258 --> 02:15.892
It's that you're never alone.

02:15.893 --> 02:19.061
It's what I realized
when I was a junior explorer.

02:19.062 --> 02:21.597
It's why I became a ranger.

02:21.598 --> 02:26.435
The park, it's full of life
all the time.

02:26.436 --> 02:28.905
Just look around.
You'll see what I mean.

02:28.906 --> 02:31.207
Like those fireflies
over there?

02:31.208 --> 02:33.676
Yep. Exactly.

02:33.677 --> 02:35.778
And that person wandering

02:35.779 --> 02:39.882
off the designated trail?

02:39.883 --> 02:42.318
You know, chip,
hop in that tent

02:42.319 --> 02:45.254
and zip up the door, okay?

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.211 --> 03:09.345
Code violation
equals nice little...

03:10.614 --> 03:12.548
Hey, you!
Stop right there.

03:17.287 --> 03:20.189
Ryan Wilson, underqualified.

03:20.190 --> 03:23.059
Larry Butler, overqualified.

03:23.060 --> 03:25.561
Nicole Mollen,
no, too specialized.

03:25.562 --> 03:29.832
Victoria Chazin, Columbia,
USC, top of her class,

03:29.833 --> 03:32.501
rotations in emergency
and family medicine.

03:32.502 --> 03:34.337
Could be good.

03:34.338 --> 03:36.305
He comes bearing merchandise.

03:36.306 --> 03:37.840
What a change of pace for him.

03:37.841 --> 03:39.709
Actually, this is not
about merchandising.

03:39.710 --> 03:41.344
This is about survival.

03:41.345 --> 03:43.145
I didn't know you could
distinguish between the two.

03:46.483 --> 03:48.150
- Nice.
- Yeah.

03:48.151 --> 03:50.386
Ooh, hand warmers.

03:50.387 --> 03:52.255
Freeze-dried meals.

03:52.256 --> 03:53.990
- Glow sticks.
- Duct tape.

03:53.991 --> 03:55.391
Are we going into hiding?

03:55.392 --> 03:57.793
No, these are emergency
preparedness kits.

03:57.794 --> 03:59.795
This is a new corporate policy
per the cfo.

03:59.796 --> 04:01.931
Every Hankmed employee
must have one

04:01.932 --> 04:04.533
on his or her person
just until further notice.

04:04.534 --> 04:07.203
Infant formula.
Really?

04:07.204 --> 04:09.038
Yeah, I had a coupon for those.

04:09.039 --> 04:10.673
Anyway, the end-of-summer storm
is coming,

04:10.674 --> 04:12.275
and we will be prepared for it.

04:12.276 --> 04:13.609
This is
the most important part.

04:13.610 --> 04:17.178
I got GPS transmitters.
One for you and one for you.

04:17.180 --> 04:19.214
I got the, uh, the mother ship.

04:19.216 --> 04:20.882
Evan, where would I possibly
get lost?

04:20.884 --> 04:24.520
And why would I want you
to be the one to find me?

04:24.521 --> 04:27.123
If the high pressure keeps
building out of Atlantic Canada,

04:27.124 --> 04:28.424
what we saw last night,

04:28.425 --> 04:29.926
that's gonna be like
a basket of kittens

04:29.927 --> 04:31.060
compared to what comes next.

04:31.061 --> 04:33.863
So just in case.
All right.

04:35.499 --> 04:36.699
Good. It works.

04:36.700 --> 04:37.900
Awesome.

04:37.901 --> 04:41.070
- Wow.
- I know, I know.

04:41.071 --> 04:44.073
Look, he's always been
terrified of thunderstorms.

04:44.074 --> 04:47.944
It's too bad Paige
isn't in town to console him.

04:47.945 --> 04:49.445
When we were little, he used
to climb into my bed

04:49.446 --> 04:52.448
during torrential downpours
and make me play board games.

04:52.449 --> 04:54.884
Well, that explains why you're
such a fan of blue skies.

04:54.885 --> 04:56.285
Exactly.

04:56.286 --> 04:57.887
Now, if you don't have
to be out on the roads,

04:57.888 --> 05:01.090
it's a good idea to stay home
and batten down the hatches.

05:01.091 --> 05:03.259
Stay right here for all
the latest developments

05:03.260 --> 05:04.961
on this end-of-summer storm.

05:04.962 --> 05:07.396
Hankmed. How can we
help you today?

05:12.169 --> 05:14.637
Yep, that's poison Ivy
all right.

05:14.638 --> 05:17.139
Leaves of three, let it be.

05:17.140 --> 05:20.109
Hairy vine, no friend of mine.

05:20.110 --> 05:22.311
I've had poison Ivy 17 times.
So...Yeah.

05:22.312 --> 05:27.917
Okay, so, chip, this will
make it feel better.

05:27.918 --> 05:29.919
Chip, how did this happen?

05:29.920 --> 05:32.188
I wandered
off the designated trail

05:32.189 --> 05:33.823
looking for ranger Pete.

05:33.824 --> 05:36.359
He disappeared last night
and never came back.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.427
Maybe ranger Pete

05:38.428 --> 05:42.298
had some important park business
to attend to.

05:42.299 --> 05:45.601
Ranger Pete!

05:45.602 --> 05:49.005
Ranger Pete, are you okay?

05:49.006 --> 05:52.375
Sir, what happened to you?

05:52.376 --> 05:56.412
I have no idea.

06:21.191 --> 06:23.958
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

06:35.355 --> 06:39.425
Pupils are equal, round,
reactive to light

06:39.426 --> 06:40.626
and accommodation.

06:40.627 --> 06:42.261
And extraocular movement
is intact?

06:43.730 --> 06:45.931
Well, what's the matter
with me?

06:45.932 --> 06:48.033
You seem to have some form
of retrograde amnesia.

06:48.034 --> 06:50.436
Losing memory of events
that preceded a trauma.

06:50.437 --> 06:52.004
Yet, I'm not finding
any of the telltale signs

06:52.005 --> 06:53.138
of a head injury.

06:53.139 --> 06:56.508
Can you guys,
indoor voice maybe?

06:56.509 --> 06:58.577
We sound loud to you right now?

06:58.578 --> 07:01.614
Yeah, I mean, not as loud as
those red-tailed hawks outside.

07:01.615 --> 07:04.083
They must be mating.

07:04.084 --> 07:06.118
Uh, do you hear hawks mating?

07:06.119 --> 07:09.221
- No.
- Hypersensitivity to sound.

07:09.222 --> 07:11.991
Pete, any other discomfort
or pain?

07:11.992 --> 07:16.862
Um, well, I mean, I got
a headache and sore muscles.

07:16.863 --> 07:18.497
You're gonna need an mri.

07:18.498 --> 07:19.732
I'll call Hamptons heritage.

07:19.733 --> 07:22.134
Good.

07:22.135 --> 07:24.803
No service.

07:24.804 --> 07:26.672
You might wanna try
in the parking lot.

07:26.673 --> 07:29.275
But really, the only reliable
place in the park

07:29.276 --> 07:33.445
is sunrise peak
out by the ocean.

07:33.446 --> 07:34.813
Can I just use that?

07:34.814 --> 07:36.215
The emergency phone?

07:36.216 --> 07:38.984
Uh, yeah.

07:38.985 --> 07:41.654
We just use it in emergencies.

07:41.655 --> 07:44.089
You're a stickler
for the rules, huh, Pete?

07:44.090 --> 07:45.424
No need to yell.

07:45.425 --> 07:47.760
Oh, right.
Indoor voice. Sorry.

07:47.761 --> 07:48.794
You're a real-life
storm chaser?

07:48.795 --> 07:50.062
In the flesh.

07:50.063 --> 07:51.363
And, no, I haven't seen
the movie

07:51.364 --> 07:52.765
or the tv show.

07:52.766 --> 07:54.366
Where's the rest of your team?

07:54.367 --> 07:56.001
It's just me and Zeus.

07:56.002 --> 07:58.370
Zeus. Well, it's nice
to meet you both.

07:58.371 --> 08:01.907
He's a next-generation
storm-tracking machine.

08:01.908 --> 08:04.209
The only guy in my life
I can rely on.

08:04.210 --> 08:06.111
Wow.
Where did you buy him?

08:06.112 --> 08:08.113
You can't buy a reliable guy.

08:08.114 --> 08:09.515
I invented him.

08:09.516 --> 08:11.650
So, uh, what do you
and your boyfriend Zeus

08:11.651 --> 08:14.086
think about this storm that's
headed our way tomorrow?

08:14.087 --> 08:17.523
Oh, we think it's gonna be
a lot bigger than expected.

08:17.524 --> 08:19.558
On tv, they said
it was gonna be pretty...

08:19.559 --> 08:21.493
what... what makes you say
it's gonna be bigger?

08:21.494 --> 08:24.196
The offshore path,
the temperature differential.

08:24.197 --> 08:27.333
We're looking at major
instability and turbulence.

08:27.334 --> 08:31.203
Wow.
Divya, no, no, put that down.

08:31.204 --> 08:32.571
Do you have a death wish?

08:32.572 --> 08:34.273
What is the matter with you?

08:34.274 --> 08:35.874
You know, the odds
of getting hit by lighting

08:35.875 --> 08:38.977
are roughly 1 in 750,000?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.346
You're saying
that there's a chance?

08:40.347 --> 08:42.313
This storm's gonna be
really bad.

08:42.315 --> 08:44.015
Okay, I just need
to call the hospital.

08:44.017 --> 08:47.553
Oh, here, use my sat phone.

08:47.554 --> 08:49.888
- Thank you very much.
- Um, Stacy sachs, storm chaser,

08:49.889 --> 08:51.190
this is Divya Katdare,
physician assistant.

08:51.191 --> 08:53.158
- Storm chaser.
- Physician assistant.

08:53.159 --> 08:54.593
Nice to meet you.

08:54.594 --> 08:56.395
Hey, maybe... uh, maybe
you could remove my cast.

08:56.396 --> 08:59.531
Fair exchange
for the phone call.

08:59.532 --> 09:03.035
Thanks.

09:03.036 --> 09:06.538
We are watching a potentially
dangerous weather pattern.

09:06.539 --> 09:08.340
We'll be looking
for some severe thunderstorms

09:08.341 --> 09:09.842
across the area by nightfall.

09:09.843 --> 09:14.012
Don't indulge the hype.
Ignore it.

09:14.013 --> 09:16.081
We're gonna get our house
in order,

09:16.082 --> 09:18.016
and we're gonna do it
by the book.

09:18.017 --> 09:20.719
So check blood, food,
and laundry supplies.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.089
Sterilize surgical equipment,
transfer and discharge

09:24.090 --> 09:25.858
whomever we can.

09:25.859 --> 09:30.829
All right, everybody.
Let's get to work.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.030
Very impressive.

09:32.031 --> 09:33.899
We could use someone
like you at the park.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.801
- You must be ranger Stambleck.
- Yes, ma'am.

09:35.802 --> 09:37.669
The mri suite
is waiting for you.

09:37.670 --> 09:39.505
Is it just me,
or is it loud in here?

09:39.506 --> 09:41.073
Well, that's what we're here
to find out.

09:41.074 --> 09:42.441
What?

09:42.442 --> 09:44.977
- Uh, that's what we're here...
- I was joking.

09:44.978 --> 09:46.245
It was a joke.

09:46.246 --> 09:49.014
Uh, ranger Pete, this way.

09:49.015 --> 09:51.750
You don't have to yell at me.

09:51.751 --> 09:54.853
So now I know why you've been
so hard to get ahold of.

09:54.854 --> 09:56.989
Yeah. I'm sorry
I haven't gotten back to you,

09:56.990 --> 09:59.558
but storm prep
is very time-consuming.

09:59.559 --> 10:01.093
Will it consume you all week?

10:01.094 --> 10:03.228
I was just thinking that...
I mean, it's been a while.

10:03.229 --> 10:05.097
Maybe we should get together.

10:05.098 --> 10:07.433
I'd like that.

10:07.434 --> 10:10.869
But the only night that I have
free this week is tomorrow.

10:10.870 --> 10:13.539
Oh, when the storm
is supposed to peak.

10:13.540 --> 10:14.940
Yeah, well, it's just
a little water.

10:14.941 --> 10:17.943
Maybe an ocean breeze.
Man up, city boy.

10:17.944 --> 10:22.981
- Tomorrow night it is then.
- Okay.

10:22.982 --> 10:25.984
Any implants
or joint replacements?

10:25.985 --> 10:28.587
Uh, no. All original parts,
thank you.

10:28.588 --> 10:29.755
Okay.

10:29.756 --> 10:31.857
You'll need
to remove your watch.

10:31.858 --> 10:32.958
Oh, I'd be happy to.

10:32.959 --> 10:34.326
The alarm beeps are deafening.

10:34.327 --> 10:36.395
Can't you just
turn off the alarm?

10:36.396 --> 10:41.266
That would involve more beeps.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.635
Oh, I never saw that.

10:43.636 --> 10:46.605
Pete, I think I may know
what's causing your amnesia.

10:46.606 --> 10:48.740
- You do?
- You do?

10:48.741 --> 10:52.244
Think back again to last night
and concentrate, okay?

10:52.245 --> 10:53.645
Because if I'm right,
you may develop other symptoms.

10:53.646 --> 10:55.547
When you were out
in that clearing,

10:55.548 --> 10:57.683
and the storm was starting
to gather,

10:57.684 --> 10:59.818
is it possible that...

11:18.238 --> 11:22.274
Oh, my God.

11:25.278 --> 11:27.980
Struck by... I don't...

11:27.981 --> 11:29.381
what are the odds?

11:29.382 --> 11:33.619
1 in 750,000.

11:33.620 --> 11:36.188
Roughly.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.227
So how did you fracture
your wrist?

11:42.228 --> 11:45.564
I was tracking violent weather
in Minneola, Kansas.

11:45.565 --> 11:47.432
Tornado alley.

11:47.433 --> 11:49.101
Sounds like a lovely place.

11:49.102 --> 11:50.435
Well, it was on this day.

11:50.436 --> 11:54.039
Until I made the mistake
of getting northeast

11:54.040 --> 11:56.141
of the updraft core
of a supercell.

11:56.142 --> 11:58.911
It threw me,
and I landed on my wrist.

11:58.912 --> 12:02.114
I'm not exactly sure
what you've just described,

12:02.115 --> 12:03.615
but sounds like something
that you'd want

12:03.616 --> 12:04.816
to stay far away from.

12:04.817 --> 12:07.352
No. No, no.
I wanted to get closer to it.

12:07.353 --> 12:08.854
It was so beautiful

12:08.855 --> 12:10.455
and thrilling.

12:10.456 --> 12:11.490
So you put yourself
in harm's way

12:11.491 --> 12:12.691
just for the thrill?

12:12.692 --> 12:14.960
Do you know
why predicting storm patterns

12:14.961 --> 12:17.229
is so hard?

12:17.230 --> 12:19.031
I don't, actually.

12:19.032 --> 12:20.699
Uh, hold still.

12:22.569 --> 12:23.869
We're done.

12:23.870 --> 12:26.271
It's because
there is so much information.

12:26.272 --> 12:27.773
Zeus can synthesize it all,

12:27.774 --> 12:29.474
assemble the big picture,

12:29.475 --> 12:32.010
and hopefully save some lives
in the process.

12:32.011 --> 12:34.479
Sounds a little lonely.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.348
At times.

12:36.349 --> 12:37.916
And it can also be dangerous,

12:37.917 --> 12:39.985
I.E., the occasional
little wrist fracture.

12:39.986 --> 12:42.187
But, no, I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

12:42.188 --> 12:45.457
Well, let's see
how that little wrist fracture

12:45.458 --> 12:48.694
has healed.
Okay, good.

12:51.864 --> 12:54.499
Stacy, how long ago
did you say that this happened?

12:54.500 --> 12:56.134
Uh, six weeks ago.

12:56.135 --> 12:59.171
You have a non-union
of the colles fracture.

12:59.172 --> 13:02.841
I'd like to talk to the doctor
who set your wrist.

13:02.842 --> 13:04.543
Okay, so maybe it happened
four weeks ago.

13:04.544 --> 13:08.013
Look, I have to get this cast
off, so I can get back to work.

13:08.014 --> 13:09.381
With both hands.

13:09.382 --> 13:11.483
Stacy, I can't take
the cast off now.

13:11.484 --> 13:13.885
And you just need
to take it a little easy.

13:13.886 --> 13:15.687
I can't take it easy.

13:15.688 --> 13:17.422
I never could.

13:17.423 --> 13:22.094
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.780
And the red-tailed hawk,
you know,

13:30.781 --> 13:32.449
it's, like,
people have this idea

13:32.450 --> 13:33.683
that it's just the tail
that's red,

13:33.684 --> 13:36.386
but it's, like,
the whole personality of it is.

13:36.387 --> 13:37.687
Hey, Pete.
How you feeling?

13:37.688 --> 13:39.155
Fine, actually.
Except for the fact

13:39.156 --> 13:40.423
that I've been here all day.

13:40.424 --> 13:41.224
Oh, yeah, we're just waiting

13:41.225 --> 13:42.392
for the results...

13:42.393 --> 13:44.794
the mri, ecg,
hearing test, blood.

13:44.795 --> 13:46.563
Was all that really necessary?

13:46.564 --> 13:49.733
For a lightning injury?
Uh, yeah.

13:49.734 --> 13:51.201
It's pretty standard
to have a good look around.

13:51.202 --> 13:53.970
Yeah. I'm shocked
to be a strike victim.

13:53.971 --> 13:55.839
I got to tell you, doc,

13:55.840 --> 13:59.476
I'm not feeling
so victim-y-ish.

13:59.477 --> 14:02.412
And I can't stand this place.

14:02.413 --> 14:04.681
You know
the windows don't even open?

14:04.682 --> 14:06.182
The only fresh air around here

14:06.183 --> 14:07.384
is in the oxygen tanks.

14:07.385 --> 14:09.653
Pete, we still need
to check your results

14:09.654 --> 14:11.187
and look for damage,
so we can anticipate

14:11.188 --> 14:12.322
any problems down the road.

14:12.323 --> 14:14.257
Like what?

14:14.258 --> 14:15.659
Well,
like neurocognitive deficits,

14:15.660 --> 14:17.294
chronic pain syndromes
that may not manifest

14:17.295 --> 14:19.029
for days or weeks.

14:19.030 --> 14:21.831
Okay.
So... so what's next?

14:21.832 --> 14:24.334
Well, in 48 hours,
we need to repeat the ecg

14:24.335 --> 14:26.970
and blood and urine tests
to check for deep-tissue damage.

14:26.971 --> 14:28.171
48 hours?
I can't spend

14:28.172 --> 14:30.006
the next two days indoors.

14:30.007 --> 14:31.141
In here?

14:31.142 --> 14:33.710
I got to get back to the park.

14:35.913 --> 14:38.648
All right.
Well, be back in 48 hours,

14:38.649 --> 14:40.150
but I'm gonna drive you
there myself.

14:40.151 --> 14:42.552
- Sweet. Let's go.
- Yeah, Pete, Pete, Pete.

14:42.553 --> 14:45.121
You may want to change.

14:45.122 --> 14:50.226
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean...
we'll do it in the car.

14:50.227 --> 14:52.562
Oh, Pete,
you can't go out like that.

14:59.937 --> 15:02.672
Listen
to all those great sounds.

15:02.673 --> 15:05.909
I can hear the northern
flicker woodpeckers.

15:05.910 --> 15:07.344
Big fan of the flicker.

15:07.345 --> 15:09.112
Excited to get back
to work, huh?

15:09.113 --> 15:10.914
- You have no idea.
- Oh.

15:13.284 --> 15:15.151
Well, good news.

15:15.152 --> 15:16.753
Your CPK is normal.

15:16.754 --> 15:18.955
And your urine is negative
for myoglobin,

15:18.956 --> 15:20.590
which means no muscle
or heart damage.

15:20.591 --> 15:22.659
- Oh, awesome.
- Yeah.

15:22.660 --> 15:25.996
Hank, you're
a very responsible doctor

15:25.997 --> 15:27.397
and a gentleman,

15:27.398 --> 15:28.732
but think
I can take it from here?

15:28.733 --> 15:29.933
Yeah, no, of course.

15:29.934 --> 15:31.568
I'm just...
I'm still concerned

15:31.569 --> 15:33.303
about the hyperacute hearing,
so I'll be checking back

15:33.304 --> 15:35.538
to make sure it resolves.
Works for me.

15:35.539 --> 15:38.141
Okay.
That looks like a nice place

15:38.142 --> 15:39.342
for a nap.

15:39.343 --> 15:41.077
Well, I don't nap there.
I sleep there.

15:41.078 --> 15:42.545
What?

15:42.546 --> 15:44.080
You sleep out here every night?

15:44.081 --> 15:47.917
Hank, there's 24 hours
in each day.

15:47.918 --> 15:49.786
Sun rises in the east,

15:49.787 --> 15:51.287
sets in the west.

15:51.288 --> 15:52.722
Nature follows rules.

15:52.723 --> 15:55.725
I try and stay as close to it
as I can.

15:55.726 --> 15:57.560
All right, well,
just don't stay too close

15:57.561 --> 16:01.564
till this storm passes.

16:01.565 --> 16:03.166
You think
lightning can strike twice?

16:03.167 --> 16:05.935
I believe in keeping people
out of hospitals,

16:05.936 --> 16:07.904
so I can't afford
to play the odds.

16:07.905 --> 16:09.272
And neither can you.

16:17.782 --> 16:20.250
Astraphobia.

16:20.251 --> 16:21.751
What?

16:21.752 --> 16:23.720
The irrational fear
of thunder and lightning.

16:23.721 --> 16:24.954
Just diagnosed you.

16:24.955 --> 16:27.891
Um, your park ranger
is actually proof

16:27.892 --> 16:30.060
that my fear
is entirely rational.

16:30.061 --> 16:32.562
Actually, you could argue
that he just took the hit

16:32.563 --> 16:35.398
for the 749,999 people
closest to him,

16:35.399 --> 16:37.567
which would make you even safer
than before.

16:37.568 --> 16:39.969
- No, it's good logic.
- It is.

16:43.074 --> 16:45.275
Safer from lightning at least.

16:50.681 --> 16:53.917
Oh, my God.

16:53.918 --> 16:55.718
Did you have wound care
on stand for me?

16:55.719 --> 16:57.053
If you'd reached
for the power drill,

16:57.054 --> 16:58.922
I was gonna start scrubbing in.

16:58.923 --> 17:00.690
Good.
Joke all you want.

17:00.691 --> 17:02.459
But when everyone else
is freaking out

17:02.460 --> 17:04.961
'cause they don't have coast
guard-approved weather gear,

17:04.962 --> 17:06.563
we'll see who's laughing then.
Dude, I have to say,

17:06.564 --> 17:08.765
I don't remember
your astraphobia

17:08.766 --> 17:10.599
ever being
quite this irrational.

17:10.601 --> 17:11.901
It's not irrational.

17:11.902 --> 17:13.837
You're tying down
a wicker frame.

17:13.838 --> 17:16.239
It's not wicker.

17:17.241 --> 17:18.641
And suddenly

17:18.642 --> 17:20.977
there were two rule zombies.

17:20.978 --> 17:22.712
And then three.

17:22.713 --> 17:25.281
These zombies were angry

17:25.281 --> 17:27.150
and drooling,

17:27.151 --> 17:29.419
looking for blood.

17:29.420 --> 17:32.088
You see, this was their park.

17:32.089 --> 17:34.924
And they weren't gonna let
some mischievous kid

17:34.925 --> 17:37.727
disrespect it
and then brag about it

17:37.728 --> 17:39.129
to his mischievous friends.

17:39.130 --> 17:41.598
They moved in closer.

17:42.933 --> 17:45.768
To be continued, explorers.

17:45.769 --> 17:47.570
Aw.
Hey.

17:47.571 --> 17:49.439
- Hey, bud.
- You guys want to join us?

17:49.440 --> 17:52.108
We're about to practice our
bowline flood rescue techniques.

17:52.109 --> 17:53.209
That sounds like fun,
but we're just here

17:53.210 --> 17:54.444
to see how you're doing.

17:54.445 --> 17:56.146
I'm on top of the world.

17:56.147 --> 17:59.382
Really. This feels
like the first time in my life

17:59.383 --> 18:01.985
people can actually see me.

18:01.986 --> 18:03.753
Maybe we should prescribe
lightning strikes

18:03.754 --> 18:04.754
to all our patients.

18:08.792 --> 18:10.193
Everything okay, Pete?

18:10.194 --> 18:12.862
Do you hear what I'm hearing?

18:12.863 --> 18:15.331
Probably not.
What is it?

18:15.332 --> 18:18.601
Banging, grunting.

18:18.602 --> 18:21.371
Maybe the hawks
are at it again.

18:21.372 --> 18:25.008
Something's not right.

18:25.009 --> 18:28.111
Explorers, stay here
within the circle of trust.

18:28.112 --> 18:32.348
The acting troop commander
will be chip,

18:32.349 --> 18:34.083
since he's most responsible.

18:38.956 --> 18:40.356
Over there.

18:40.357 --> 18:43.493
She's in a non-designated area.

18:45.529 --> 18:47.697
Ma'am, don't move.

18:47.698 --> 18:50.500
Stacy!

18:53.737 --> 18:54.604
Ma'am, don't move.

18:55.107 --> 18:57.041
Hey, you're the fugitive
from the other night.

19:00.646 --> 19:02.246
Easy.

19:02.247 --> 19:04.482
He shouldn't be going down
in that area.

19:06.118 --> 19:07.852
Hey, Stacy,

19:07.853 --> 19:09.287
hi, I'm a doctor.

19:09.288 --> 19:10.621
Let me just take a look at you.

19:10.622 --> 19:12.123
- I'm really all right.
- Okay. Okay.

19:12.124 --> 19:13.157
Is she okay?

19:13.158 --> 19:16.260
I think you broke
my hard drive.

19:16.261 --> 19:17.461
Let's make sure
that's the only thing

19:17.462 --> 19:19.030
that broke.
Is your arm okay?

19:19.031 --> 19:20.398
I told you.
I'm okay.

19:20.399 --> 19:21.799
I need to make sure
that my transceiver

19:21.800 --> 19:24.368
is up and running
before the storm hits tonight.

19:24.369 --> 19:26.037
You're gonna need a permit
for that.

19:26.038 --> 19:28.072
All right, you know what,

19:28.073 --> 19:30.074
ma'am, here's the situation.

19:30.075 --> 19:33.344
We're gonna safely vacate you
from the restricted area.

19:33.345 --> 19:35.680
Then you need to clean up
your stuff.

19:35.681 --> 19:38.983
How am I supposed to clean up
if I've been vacated?

19:41.453 --> 19:42.653
It's a fair point.

19:42.654 --> 19:44.288
Let's get you up from here.

19:44.289 --> 19:45.656
Listen,
I'm not bothering anyone.

19:45.657 --> 19:47.592
- I know. Come.
- Here we go.

19:47.593 --> 19:49.961
- Okay.
- Grab my hand, ma'am.

19:49.962 --> 19:54.599
One, two, three.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.101
Yeah.
There we go.

19:58.971 --> 20:01.072
Whoa.
That's... that's weird.

20:01.073 --> 20:04.241
Yeah, I'll say.

20:04.242 --> 20:07.511
Yeah, I guess
I rescued you too hard.

20:07.512 --> 20:10.047
No, no, no, no.
That... that noise.

20:10.048 --> 20:14.552
Um, hey, is that...

20:14.553 --> 20:16.354
did you get zapped?

20:16.355 --> 20:19.056
Did I...
um, well, yeah.

20:19.057 --> 20:20.391
And you're okay?

20:20.392 --> 20:21.692
Actually,
it's a bit early to say.

20:21.693 --> 20:24.762
I've never met anyone
who was struck before.

20:24.763 --> 20:26.263
I mean, the odds
of that happening.

20:26.264 --> 20:28.065
1 in 750,000.

20:28.066 --> 20:31.102
Exactly. I mean,
well, roughly.

20:31.103 --> 20:35.906
Gah, connecting to nature
in such a primal way

20:35.907 --> 20:37.942
kind of makes you a rock star.

20:37.943 --> 20:41.112
I mean,
in meteorological circles.

20:41.113 --> 20:42.747
You know, I...
can you get off...

20:42.748 --> 20:43.881
that's my gun.
Oh.

20:43.882 --> 20:46.217
- That's not... yeah...
- Ah!

20:46.218 --> 20:47.284
Ooh, here, let me help you.

20:50.589 --> 20:52.089
Oh, my rib.
Stacy, Stacy,

20:52.090 --> 20:53.224
we should really take
a look at that.

20:53.225 --> 20:55.326
I'm okay.

20:55.327 --> 20:56.627
Oh, there it is.

20:56.628 --> 20:58.729
Yeah, looks like you fractured
the eighth rib

20:58.730 --> 20:59.930
on your right side.

20:59.931 --> 21:01.499
That's no big deal, right?

21:01.500 --> 21:03.501
And the buzzing in my ears,
I mean,

21:03.502 --> 21:05.102
I only heard it
for a few seconds.

21:05.103 --> 21:06.470
Yeah, I don't see
any signs of head trauma.

21:06.471 --> 21:08.406
You were probably just hearing
your pulse racing

21:08.407 --> 21:09.807
from all the adrenaline.

21:09.808 --> 21:12.043
Have you had
many other bone injuries before?

21:12.044 --> 21:13.811
Comes with the job.

21:13.812 --> 21:18.482
Um, I broke my tibia
chasing an f3 tornado in Iowa.

21:18.483 --> 21:21.419
I fractured my clavicle
during hurricane Charlie.

21:21.420 --> 21:23.988
Oh, and I chipped a bone
in my foot

21:23.989 --> 21:25.589
getting out of my truck twice.

21:25.590 --> 21:29.326
You might have mentioned
all of these injuries yesterday.

21:29.327 --> 21:31.429
Believe me,
I get banged up on the job

21:31.430 --> 21:32.730
all the time.

21:32.731 --> 21:34.165
Yeah, no, I'm sure,
but this is more

21:34.166 --> 21:36.300
than just hazards of the trade.

21:36.301 --> 21:38.569
Your bones look

21:38.570 --> 21:40.204
a bit pale here,

21:40.205 --> 21:41.939
not quite as dense
as I'd normally like to see.

21:41.940 --> 21:45.242
You know what, I noticed
the same thing yesterday

21:45.243 --> 21:47.244
when I did her wrist X-ray.

21:47.245 --> 21:49.413
She's awfully young
for osteomalacia.

21:49.414 --> 21:50.848
Osteo-what?

21:50.849 --> 21:52.650
It's a deficiency
in the components

21:52.651 --> 21:55.086
used to make bone...
vitamin d, phosphorus...

21:55.087 --> 21:56.854
Okay, enough about my ribs.

21:56.855 --> 21:58.956
You guys, how about just
slipping me some painkillers

21:58.957 --> 22:02.193
and getting this cast off
so I can get back to work?

22:02.194 --> 22:04.929
Okay, Stacy, you really need
to slow down.

22:04.930 --> 22:07.431
I will have plenty of time
to relax next week,

22:07.432 --> 22:09.233
but there is
a severe weather event

22:09.234 --> 22:11.936
peaking tonight, and I intend
to be right in its path.

22:11.937 --> 22:13.704
Have you had
any surgeries recently?

22:13.705 --> 22:15.406
- Nope.
- Are you taking any meds?

22:15.407 --> 22:16.540
- Nope.
- It could be you're not getting

22:16.541 --> 22:17.942
enough vitamins and minerals
in your diet

22:17.943 --> 22:19.376
or just malabsorption.

22:19.377 --> 22:21.312
We should order
a full metabolic workup,

22:21.313 --> 22:23.080
and let's track down
all of Stacy's previous x-rays.

22:23.081 --> 22:24.415
Sounds like there may be
a lot of them.

22:24.416 --> 22:26.550
- Okay, doc, can't we just...
- Nope. Sorry.

22:26.551 --> 22:28.552
Cast won't come off
before next week.

22:28.553 --> 22:30.387
Can you finish up
with this storm chaser?

22:30.388 --> 22:31.589
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

22:33.558 --> 22:35.159
Um, hankmed memorandum.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.062
In the unlikely,
but actually very likely event

22:38.063 --> 22:39.597
that the national power grid
goes down,

22:39.598 --> 22:42.833
all patient accounts shall now
be settled in cash, okay?

22:42.834 --> 22:45.069
Regarding your memorandum
of two seconds ago

22:45.070 --> 22:47.338
concerning patient accounts,
no.

22:47.339 --> 22:48.973
Okay, where...
whoa, where are you going?

22:48.974 --> 22:51.675
Got to change.
I'm meeting Jill for dinner.

22:51.676 --> 22:54.111
Okay.
Tonight?

22:54.112 --> 22:55.179
Going out tonight?
Yeah.

22:55.180 --> 22:57.548
Are you out of your mind?

22:57.549 --> 22:59.283
You should be here.

22:59.284 --> 23:01.385
You should be helping me
batten down the hatches.

23:01.386 --> 23:02.686
We have hatches, right?

23:02.687 --> 23:03.387
I'm sure
Boris must have hatches.

23:03.388 --> 23:04.755
Stop saying hatches.

23:04.756 --> 23:06.190
And don't wait up for me.

23:06.191 --> 23:08.192
Just leave
the front hatch unlocked.

23:15.333 --> 23:18.602
So I just want to let you know

23:18.603 --> 23:21.305
Emily and I broke up.

23:24.743 --> 23:26.343
Yeah

23:26.344 --> 23:27.578
she dumped you.

23:27.579 --> 23:29.180
Why would you assume that?

23:29.181 --> 23:34.418
Hot, blonde doctor.
Sexy medical banter.

23:34.419 --> 23:35.953
Feisty in the bedroom.

23:35.954 --> 23:37.955
You expect me to believe
you'd walk away from that?

23:39.991 --> 23:41.725
I...

23:41.726 --> 23:43.027
Sorry, one sec.

23:43.028 --> 23:44.795
Yeah.
Yeah, hello?

23:44.796 --> 23:46.497
Hello, Hank?
Can you hear me?

23:46.498 --> 23:48.199
Pete, what's wrong?

23:48.200 --> 23:51.168
The northern leopard frog
is gone.

23:51.169 --> 23:52.436
The what... what's gone?

23:52.437 --> 23:54.772
The northern leopard frog.

23:54.773 --> 23:57.208
I can't hear
its distinctive grunts anymore

23:57.209 --> 23:59.977
or any of the other sounds
from before.

23:59.978 --> 24:03.080
Just this annoying thump
in my ear.

24:03.081 --> 24:04.815
It's common
for that to go away.

24:04.816 --> 24:07.418
And that thumping
is called residual tinnitus.

24:07.419 --> 24:09.753
Completely normal
for someone struck by lightning.

24:09.754 --> 24:14.925
It's not just that, Hank.

24:14.926 --> 24:19.430
I feel like I lost my mojo.

24:19.431 --> 24:22.066
I...

24:22.067 --> 24:25.870
I feel all alone out here.

24:25.871 --> 24:27.705
Invisible again.

24:27.706 --> 24:28.973
You've been through a trauma.

24:28.974 --> 24:31.342
You know, mood swings
are to be expected.

24:31.343 --> 24:32.977
Listen, I want you to go inside

24:32.978 --> 24:34.445
and wait for me

24:34.446 --> 24:35.679
by the ranger station, okay?

24:35.680 --> 24:38.849
But the lightning's coming.

24:38.850 --> 24:42.820
You know, I... I need...
I need...

24:42.821 --> 24:45.022
what... what...
you need what?

24:45.023 --> 24:47.057
Shoot.

24:47.058 --> 24:48.959
Listen, would you mind
if we make a stop

24:48.960 --> 24:51.128
on the way to dinner?
No, not at all.

24:51.129 --> 24:52.897
Thank you.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.041
Well, I'm glad to see
you're taking it easy.

25:04.042 --> 25:06.310
The storm is approaching
the target area, doc.

25:06.311 --> 25:07.578
Time to saddle up.

25:07.579 --> 25:08.746
Something wrong?

25:08.747 --> 25:10.080
Yeah, have you seen
ranger Pete?

25:10.081 --> 25:11.415
He's not at the station.

25:11.416 --> 25:13.517
No, I think
that falling on top of him

25:13.518 --> 25:15.185
was enough awkwardness
for one day.

25:15.186 --> 25:17.354
Well, this may be
a medical emergency.

25:17.355 --> 25:19.023
We need to find him.

25:19.024 --> 25:21.959
Stacy, the buzzing in your ear

25:21.960 --> 25:23.527
that you told me about.
Yeah?

25:23.528 --> 25:24.862
I need to know exactly
when you first noticed it.

25:24.863 --> 25:27.097
Was it right around the time
you landed on Pete?

25:27.098 --> 25:29.934
Yeah, but I thought
that you said that was nothing.

25:29.935 --> 25:31.669
Okay, try to remember,
was it a buzz

25:31.670 --> 25:34.038
or was it more
of, like, a whooshing sound?

25:34.039 --> 25:37.107
It was more of a whooshing,

25:37.108 --> 25:38.876
and I also felt a vibration.

25:38.877 --> 25:41.045
Okay, what I think
you heard or felt

25:41.046 --> 25:42.479
wasn't coming from you.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.214
It was coming from Pete,
from his neck.

25:44.215 --> 25:45.849
We need to find him now
before he has a stroke.

25:45.850 --> 25:47.051
- Stroke?
- Yeah.

25:47.052 --> 25:48.419
Well, what can I do?

25:48.420 --> 25:49.720
There's a spot
in the park that...

25:49.721 --> 25:50.921
the one that gets
a decent signal.

25:50.922 --> 25:52.056
- Yes, sunrise peak.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:52.057 --> 25:53.290
Come with me.
I know a shortcut.

25:53.291 --> 25:55.960
Great.

26:08.540 --> 26:09.907
Pete!

26:14.813 --> 26:16.380
Pete,
you shouldn't be out here.

26:20.318 --> 26:21.752
I'll call 911!

26:26.718 --> 26:28.119
Did he get hit again?

26:28.120 --> 26:30.187
I didn't see any lightning
over here.

26:30.188 --> 26:33.190
He probably suffered
a transient ischemic attack.

26:33.191 --> 26:34.959
I think he has a tear
in his carotid artery,

26:34.960 --> 26:36.694
which could have caused
a small clot.

26:36.695 --> 26:39.864
Come on, buddy.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.602
There he is.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.637
Hey, Pete, we're gonna get you
out of here soon.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.010
Yup.
There it is.

26:53.011 --> 26:55.079
A dissection
of your carotid artery.

26:55.080 --> 26:58.883
It wasn't the lightning?

26:58.884 --> 27:00.117
Well, yes and no.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.285
When you got struck
the other day,

27:01.286 --> 27:03.087
I think the impact threw you
to the ground

27:03.088 --> 27:04.922
with such force,
it tore the artery

27:04.923 --> 27:06.357
in your neck.

27:06.358 --> 27:09.293
Well, how could I
not feel that?

27:09.294 --> 27:11.061
It probably started
as a very small tear

27:11.062 --> 27:12.196
that took a few days to grow,

27:12.197 --> 27:13.397
so it was easy
to miss at first.

27:13.398 --> 27:15.199
Hank, I still can't get
a cell signal.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.300
Well, we need to get him
to a hospital.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.568
There's got to be another...

27:17.569 --> 27:18.702
ambulance is on the way.

27:18.703 --> 27:20.204
Great.
Thank you.

27:20.205 --> 27:22.640
Okay, bud.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.008
Sorry to bother you

27:24.009 --> 27:26.410
while you are out to dinner,

27:26.411 --> 27:30.314
but Stacy's blood and urine
lab work are back,

27:30.315 --> 27:34.084
and they confirm
it's osteomalacia.

27:34.085 --> 27:35.753
Question now is why.

27:35.754 --> 27:38.255
Kidney failure, pancreatitis,

27:38.256 --> 27:41.358
acidosis...
none of them make sense

27:41.359 --> 27:44.261
for a seemingly healthy
33-year-old.

27:44.262 --> 27:46.597
I feel like we're missing
something, Hank.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.532
Call me back?

27:48.533 --> 27:50.901
Okay, so I know who Stacy is,
I know what urine is.

27:50.902 --> 27:52.236
The rest you're going
to have to explain.

27:52.237 --> 27:53.671
Maybe later.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.907
I am just about to take off.
Okay.

27:56.908 --> 27:58.709
I'm very interested
in Stacy's case, you know.

27:58.710 --> 28:00.377
- You are?
- Yeah, chasing storms

28:00.378 --> 28:01.545
is her whole life.

28:01.546 --> 28:03.280
Um, plus Hank isn't here,

28:03.281 --> 28:05.616
so I'm second in command.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.151
All right, I'm tied for second.

28:07.152 --> 28:09.253
Okay?
I thought maybe you could use

28:09.254 --> 28:10.454
someone to bounce things off of.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.223
Well, that is very sweet.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.625
But I am headed home
before the rains start

28:14.626 --> 28:16.560
and the roads flood.

28:16.561 --> 28:19.129
Um, so did you not hear
what Stephanie Abrams said

28:19.130 --> 28:20.197
on the weather channel today?

28:20.198 --> 28:22.032
She said this is the big one,

28:22.033 --> 28:23.267
the end-of-summer storm.

28:23.268 --> 28:24.602
The Mayans were right.

28:24.603 --> 28:25.836
It's not safe out there.

28:25.837 --> 28:27.404
She said that, like, four times.

28:27.405 --> 28:29.306
Evan, I'll be fine.

28:29.307 --> 28:30.941
You know what, Divya,

28:30.942 --> 28:33.611
I can't allow it.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.579
What about raj?

28:35.580 --> 28:37.181
What would raj do
if he lost you?

28:37.182 --> 28:38.315
Just think about him.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.718
Or does he have other wives?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.519
Look, look, look,
this is not the time

28:42.520 --> 28:44.088
for you to be out
on the open road

28:44.089 --> 28:46.824
in your car by yourself...

28:46.825 --> 28:48.993
Divya.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.500
Well, I suppose
that there is more space

28:56.501 --> 28:59.270
to work here.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.838
And your refrigerator
is better stocked than mine.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.273
I stocked it today, yeah.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.976
So, uh...

29:05.977 --> 29:11.248
Maybe I'll, you know,
ride out the storm here.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.783
If that is okay with you.

29:12.784 --> 29:13.851
Sure. Absolutely.
Yeah.

29:13.852 --> 29:16.020
If it makes you feel safer.

29:18.657 --> 29:21.792
Okay.
So you wanna play risk?

29:21.793 --> 29:23.460
- A board game?
- Yeah.

29:23.461 --> 29:26.096
You can have India.

29:27.198 --> 29:28.599
All right, we need a head ct

29:28.600 --> 29:31.435
to rule out hemorrhagic stroke
and a ct angio of his neck

29:31.436 --> 29:33.070
to confirm my diagnosis.

29:33.071 --> 29:35.139
The vascular surgeon's
waiting at the E.R.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.206
Lift.

29:40.045 --> 29:42.146
You're gonna be fine, Pete.

29:42.147 --> 29:43.847
Thanks for saving my life,
Hank.

29:43.848 --> 29:46.116
Hey, you can thank Stacy.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.818
She's the one who could hear
your damaged artery

29:47.819 --> 29:48.986
when she fell on you.

29:48.987 --> 29:50.354
Good thing I rescued her.

29:50.355 --> 29:51.755
If we hadn't caught this now,
it could have led

29:51.756 --> 29:53.424
to a major stroke.

29:57.495 --> 30:01.265
Pete, what were you doing
out there?

30:03.501 --> 30:05.903
I don't know.

30:05.904 --> 30:08.872
I was looking for something.

30:08.873 --> 30:10.574
Whatever it is,
you're not gonna find it

30:10.575 --> 30:11.942
in a lightning storm.

30:11.943 --> 30:13.444
Maybe you already have it.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.179
You just need the confidence
to trust that.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.648
- Hey, doc.
- Yeah.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.950
Uh, can I ride with him?

30:19.951 --> 30:22.419
- Yeah, if it's okay with...
- Really?

30:22.420 --> 30:25.322
Sure.
No, wait a minute.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.857
You can't miss the storm.

30:26.858 --> 30:28.058
That's the only reason
you're here.

30:28.059 --> 30:30.461
Are you kidding?

30:30.462 --> 30:33.263
I get to hang out
with an actual lightning victim.

30:33.264 --> 30:35.733
That's
the best field study ever.

30:35.734 --> 30:37.735
And, besides,
there's always another storm.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.603
That's the beauty of nature.

30:41.940 --> 30:45.476
You know, I remember something
about when I got zapped.

30:45.477 --> 30:46.677
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.679
Pete, we'll meet you there.

30:53.118 --> 30:56.320
Something tells me
Chewy's isn't gonna be open.

30:56.321 --> 30:57.588
Yeah, I'm sorry
we didn't make it to dinner.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.257
I guess we'll have
to take a rain...

31:06.798 --> 31:09.166
Are you okay?

31:09.167 --> 31:10.934
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:10.935 --> 31:13.070
Okay, good.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.406
And glad we didn't get here
three seconds sooner.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.341
Okay.

31:27.318 --> 31:28.886
Ugh.
Perfect.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.265
Like I was saying, rain check.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.100
Yeah.

31:43.101 --> 31:45.602
Exactly.

31:51.376 --> 31:54.645
All right, come on, Divs.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.880
I'm attacking yakutsk.

31:56.881 --> 31:58.482
Evan, I am here
because there is a storm

31:58.483 --> 32:00.451
raging outside,
not because I want

32:00.452 --> 32:02.986
to relive being a teenager.

32:02.987 --> 32:05.289
With no life.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.928
Though that is exactly
what a teenage girl sounds like.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.496
<i>Maybe you should be watching
twilight.</i>

32:12.497 --> 32:14.465
Seen it.
Team Edward.

32:14.466 --> 32:18.035
Hank,
sorry to bother you again,

32:18.036 --> 32:20.971
but I have been reviewing
some case studies,

32:20.972 --> 32:23.974
and there is one condition
that we haven't ruled out yet

32:23.975 --> 32:25.309
for Stacy.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.177
Unfortunately, diagnosing it

32:27.178 --> 32:29.379
requires a full-body scan.

32:29.380 --> 32:32.316
Call me.
I'm here with Evan.

32:32.317 --> 32:34.718
Alone.

32:37.555 --> 32:39.923
Of course.

32:45.029 --> 32:47.431
- Still no signal?
- Nope.

32:47.432 --> 32:49.366
Okay, we can't stay here
all night.

32:49.367 --> 32:52.035
I'm gonna walk to the main road
and try to find some help.

32:52.036 --> 32:53.337
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

32:53.338 --> 32:54.972
Hank, no.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.874
You're gonna have to swim
your way out of the park.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.242
Oh, really?
That's the first time

32:58.243 --> 33:00.077
I've seen you show any concern
about the storm.

33:00.078 --> 33:04.014
Well, it's the first time I've
been almost crushed by a tree.

33:04.015 --> 33:07.184
True. Okay.
Don't go anywhere now.

33:07.185 --> 33:09.219
I'm going with you.
That's where I'm going.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.354
All right.

33:15.460 --> 33:16.927
Bad idea!
Back to the car!

33:21.933 --> 33:24.635
Okay, that was possibly
the worst idea ever.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.503
Yeah, it seemed
like a good idea at the time.

33:27.805 --> 33:29.873
Wow.

33:29.874 --> 33:32.910
Maybe we should just stay here
a while.

33:32.911 --> 33:35.445
Now that's the best idea ever.

33:35.446 --> 33:36.880
Okay.

33:36.881 --> 33:39.650
They should not be out
in this weather.

33:39.651 --> 33:40.784
Evan, relax.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.586
They're having dinner.

33:42.587 --> 33:45.656
And not only
is this power outage temporary,

33:45.657 --> 33:48.659
but you are completely prepared
for it.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.764
In fact, because of you,

33:53.765 --> 33:56.066
we all are.
You're right. It's go time.

33:56.067 --> 34:00.037
Just let me flip on our new
emergency backup generator.

34:08.213 --> 34:11.614
Anything?
Nope.

34:16.853 --> 34:19.523
Anything?
No.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.831
- Anything?
- Still no.

34:32.437 --> 34:33.737
So much for your battle plan.

34:33.737 --> 34:36.940
You know, at least I had one.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.175
That may
or may not have involved

34:38.176 --> 34:40.944
me buying a generator
on Craigslist.

34:40.945 --> 34:42.312
As-is.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.818
Thank you.

34:50.154 --> 34:54.491
Damn the end of summer.

34:54.492 --> 34:55.859
What did you just say?

34:55.860 --> 34:57.928
- I said,
"damn the end-of-summer storm."

34:57.929 --> 35:03.300
No, you said,
"damn the end of summer."

35:06.537 --> 35:08.672
It doesn't take a psychologist

35:08.673 --> 35:11.708
to figure out
where you're going with this.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.114
Where are you going with this?

35:17.115 --> 35:21.084
Maybe this isn't
about the storm.

35:23.888 --> 35:26.523
Your father could be going
to prison.

35:26.524 --> 35:29.326
Many of Hankmed's clients will
be leaving their summer homes.

35:29.327 --> 35:32.229
You'll be leaving the Hamptons.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.298
Which means we'll still have

35:34.299 --> 35:36.099
a zillion resumes
to go through.

35:36.100 --> 35:40.437
Then I'll have to train
your replacement.

35:40.438 --> 35:42.839
Yeah, it does feel
like everything's up in the air.

35:42.840 --> 35:46.209
Yeah.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.477
In a few weeks,

35:47.478 --> 35:49.246
I will be moving to London,

35:49.247 --> 35:50.480
starting a whole new life.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.716
It is unsettling.

35:52.717 --> 35:54.618
But like all storms,

35:54.619 --> 35:57.421
this one is going to pass.

35:57.422 --> 36:01.558
And you'll be fine, Evan.

36:01.559 --> 36:03.427
We both will.

36:17.141 --> 36:18.608
Is that the worst of it?

36:18.609 --> 36:21.144
Maybe Zeus miscalculated
on this one.

36:21.145 --> 36:23.880
Maybe his thought process
is flawed.

36:23.881 --> 36:26.783
Maybe not.

36:26.784 --> 36:29.453
Evan, can you connect
the laptop

36:29.454 --> 36:30.787
to the big screen?

36:30.788 --> 36:35.392
Stacy said that the key
to predicting

36:35.393 --> 36:38.962
a storm pattern was to
synthesize all the information

36:38.963 --> 36:42.766
and assemble the big picture.

36:42.767 --> 36:45.302
We don't have to wait
for a full-body scan.

36:45.303 --> 36:47.938
Stacy's had
so many prior breaks

36:47.939 --> 36:50.774
that most of her body
has already been x-rayed.

36:50.775 --> 36:52.743
That's so cool.
That's almost her whole body.

36:54.779 --> 36:56.213
There it is.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.748
Where?

36:57.749 --> 36:59.049
On her right foot.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.619
From an X-ray taken
two years ago.

37:02.620 --> 37:05.489
I think that that little growth

37:05.490 --> 37:06.923
is what's causing
the malabsorption.

37:06.924 --> 37:09.426
And if I'm right,

37:09.427 --> 37:11.128
it's an easy fix.

37:11.129 --> 37:13.163
Wow.

37:13.164 --> 37:17.434
It's almost like you've turned
into Hank.

37:17.435 --> 37:20.270
Except you say "shedule."

37:20.271 --> 37:23.140
Let's see what
we've got in here.

37:25.076 --> 37:28.378
Okay.

37:28.379 --> 37:31.615
Blankie.
Yes. Yes, yes.

37:31.616 --> 37:34.151
Could have used these
five minutes ago.

37:34.152 --> 37:35.385
Yeah.

37:35.386 --> 37:36.887
You got an emergency change

37:36.888 --> 37:38.455
of casual women's clothing?

37:38.456 --> 37:43.827
Even better. Beef stew
and mediterranean chicken.

37:43.828 --> 37:47.230
Vacuum-packed
for maximum freshness.

37:48.366 --> 37:49.566
Lady's choice.

37:54.806 --> 37:57.407
Hank, you really are prepared
for any situation.

37:57.408 --> 37:58.542
It's all Evan.

37:58.543 --> 37:59.743
Oh, he must never know

37:59.744 --> 38:01.545
this emergency kit
actually came in handy.

38:01.546 --> 38:02.879
Deal.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.048
Okay.

38:07.318 --> 38:08.985
Okay.

38:14.258 --> 38:17.093
Honestly, I expected worse.

38:17.094 --> 38:19.062
You think this is good, I know

38:19.063 --> 38:21.097
this terrific freeze-dried place
in southampton.

38:21.098 --> 38:22.299
The best.

38:43.205 --> 38:47.275
I'm at the hospital
with Stacy and Pete.

38:47.276 --> 38:49.778
It would be nice if you called.

38:49.779 --> 38:53.148
I'm getting worried, Hank.

38:53.149 --> 38:55.316
I can't tell
the difference, can you?

38:55.317 --> 38:56.885
I'm so sorry.

38:56.886 --> 38:58.687
The roads must be a mess
after the storm.

38:58.688 --> 39:01.489
I am sure
that Hank is on his way.

39:01.490 --> 39:04.125
But your carotid stent
procedure went very well,

39:04.126 --> 39:05.527
Mr. Stambleck.

39:05.528 --> 39:07.095
You should be back to work
in a couple of days.

39:07.096 --> 39:08.830
Writing as many citations
as you want.

39:08.831 --> 39:11.933
And I hate
to state the obvious,

39:11.934 --> 39:15.203
but you should avoid any further
lightning encounters.

39:15.204 --> 39:17.072
No worries.
We're hoping to install

39:17.073 --> 39:20.875
the new Zeus detection system
in the park next month.

39:20.876 --> 39:22.811
Pretty amazing technology.

39:22.812 --> 39:26.581
So as soon as they remove
this thing from my foot,

39:26.582 --> 39:28.216
my bones just go back to normal?

39:28.217 --> 39:30.685
It's called
oncogenic osteomalacia.

39:30.686 --> 39:32.754
- Okay.
- The growth secretes

39:32.755 --> 39:35.657
an enzyme that inhibits
vitamin and mineral absorption

39:35.658 --> 39:36.958
into your bones.

39:36.959 --> 39:39.327
After the surgery,
your bones will be able

39:39.328 --> 39:40.495
to absorb them again

39:40.496 --> 39:43.264
and should normalize
in a couple of months.

39:43.265 --> 39:44.933
In storm chaser lingo,

39:44.934 --> 39:48.336
ff I would say
that this condition is an f1.

39:48.337 --> 39:49.704
Oh, I can sleep
through one of those.

39:49.705 --> 39:51.339
So Jill's not in her office,

39:51.340 --> 39:53.174
and the nurses told me
that her phone's been going

39:53.175 --> 39:54.375
straight to voice mail
for hours.

39:54.376 --> 39:56.678
Well, they were both with us

39:56.679 --> 39:57.879
in the park last night.

39:57.880 --> 39:59.214
They were supposed
to mt us here.

39:59.215 --> 40:01.750
- How big is the park?
- About 1,700 acres.

40:01.751 --> 40:03.551
So they could be anywhere.

40:03.552 --> 40:05.153
I can call in a search team.

40:05.154 --> 40:06.688
Or we could use my truck.

40:06.689 --> 40:10.158
Actually, I got this one.

40:10.159 --> 40:12.160
I got it.

40:20.369 --> 40:22.303
So I'm not gonna harp
on the fact

40:22.304 --> 40:24.606
that my thorough storm
preparations were mocked,

40:24.607 --> 40:27.175
much like Benjamin Franklin
was mocked

40:27.176 --> 40:29.377
when he flew his kite too close
to the liberty bell.

40:29.378 --> 40:31.179
You're harping.

40:31.180 --> 40:33.314
And bastardizing
American history.

40:33.315 --> 40:34.983
But who's grateful now
that I put

40:34.984 --> 40:37.085
state-of-the-art GPS locators
in your bags?

40:37.086 --> 40:39.053
Grateful that you can track
my every move?

40:39.054 --> 40:42.023
Divs, I prefer to think of it

40:42.024 --> 40:45.894
as protecting my valuables,
actually.

40:49.532 --> 40:51.900
Bingo.

40:56.272 --> 40:57.405
Guys!

40:57.406 --> 40:58.973
Hey, guys!

40:58.974 --> 41:00.942
Hey, we're here to rescue you.

41:00.943 --> 41:03.144
Guys.

41:03.145 --> 41:05.847
Hey.

41:05.848 --> 41:07.515
Oh, my God.

41:07.516 --> 41:10.185
What?

41:11.854 --> 41:17.659
It looks
like they rescued each other.

41:17.660 --> 41:20.061
What should we do?

41:20.062 --> 41:21.329
Well, we should leave them be

41:21.330 --> 41:23.598
while we call for road service.

41:23.599 --> 41:26.701
Oh, my God.

41:26.702 --> 41:29.204
There's no signal out here,
though.

41:29.205 --> 41:31.806
There's nothing.

41:31.807 --> 41:34.008
You know, I believe
that there is an emergency phone

41:34.009 --> 41:35.877
at the ranger station.

41:35.878 --> 41:38.012
Oh, my God, Jill and Hank.

41:38.013 --> 41:39.380
Jank!

41:39.381 --> 41:41.049
Jank is back.

41:41.050 --> 41:44.252
That's hilarious.

41:44.253 --> 41:47.488
Hey, we made
a pretty good team.

41:49.124 --> 41:51.426
We should have a combo name,
in fact.

41:51.427 --> 41:54.495
Evan and Divya...
Evadivs.

41:54.496 --> 41:55.697
Eva... that's weak.

41:55.698 --> 41:59.601
Divya and Evan... Divyan.
Divyan?

41:59.602 --> 42:01.135
Okay, here's one.

42:01.136 --> 42:03.571
Divya and idiot.

42:03.572 --> 42:05.240
Didiot.

42:07.142 --> 42:09.611
Not bad.

42:18.087 --> 42:19.320
This is Stephanie Abrams.

42:19.321 --> 42:20.588
You know, I always thought...

42:20.589 --> 42:22.857
She's a weather woman, okay?

42:22.858 --> 42:24.592
Show some respect.

42:24.593 --> 42:27.061
And enjoy the sunshine.
Maybe go down to the market,

42:27.062 --> 42:28.897
get some fresh fish,
a bottle of wine,

42:28.898 --> 42:30.865
and have a good night.
