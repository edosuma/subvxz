WEBVTT

00:24.793 --> 00:26.482
There's gold
all through these rugs now.

00:27.172 --> 00:29.068
Look at this little guy.

00:29.068 --> 00:31.586
<i>Deep in
the Yukon wilderness,</i>

00:31.586 --> 00:35.275
<i>Rick Ness is on a mission
to make millions in gold</i>

00:35.275 --> 00:37.310
<i>after a year off mining,</i>

00:37.310 --> 00:39.103
<i>left him nearly broke.</i>

00:39.103 --> 00:40.551
Oh, yeah,
it's all good.

00:40.551 --> 00:41.448
Really good.

00:42.586 --> 00:44.344
But I mean,
it's just a small crew.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.758
We're working well together,

00:46.379 --> 00:47.551
having fun.

00:47.551 --> 00:48.793
The gold is showing up.

00:48.793 --> 00:50.172
It was a great way
to start the season,

00:50.172 --> 00:51.620
you know, now, I'll have
a little money in the bank

00:51.620 --> 00:53.275
to start going forward.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.758
<i>A month into the season,</i>

00:56.758 --> 00:59.137
<i>Rick's finding his footing.</i>

00:59.137 --> 01:01.620
<i>His lean crew are working
through a pile</i>

01:01.620 --> 01:03.931
<i>of leftover
rally valley pay dirt.</i>

01:04.379 --> 01:05.689
<i>And so far,</i>

01:05.689 --> 01:08.137
<i>he's banked 65 ounces,</i>

01:08.137 --> 01:11.413
<i>one hundred thirty thousand
dollars in gold.</i>

01:12.896 --> 01:14.896
I mean,
we're not breaking
any records as of right now,

01:14.896 --> 01:16.724
but I mean, we're definitely
getting ahead,

01:16.724 --> 01:17.827
and I'm happy about that.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.413
And you know,
we'll start to add people

01:19.413 --> 01:20.862
and start to grow.

01:20.862 --> 01:23.896
And if we can keep
on this pace, I think it's...

01:23.896 --> 01:26.413
we're on track for a good
profitable season.

01:26.413 --> 01:28.137
All right,
let's fire this pig up.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.482
<i>I'm definitely glad
to be here.</i>

01:40.482 --> 01:42.793
Especially, now that
we're seeing the pay

01:42.793 --> 01:44.448
coming through
the sluice every day,

01:44.448 --> 01:46.344
it's just getting thicker
and thicker.

01:46.344 --> 01:47.655
<i>In the loader,</i>

01:47.655 --> 01:50.241
<i>Greenhorn gold miner,
Morgan Lauren,</i>

01:50.241 --> 01:53.275
<i>feeds 120 yards an hour of pay</i>

01:53.275 --> 01:56.137
<i>into wash plant, Monster Red.</i>

01:56.137 --> 01:59.241
<i>Coming out here
was more than just a gamble,</i>

01:59.241 --> 02:00.931
but I'm loving it

02:00.931 --> 02:03.000
and I'm very happy
with my choice.

02:16.482 --> 02:18.448
<i>New hire,
Buzz Legault,</i>

02:18.448 --> 02:20.965
<i>trucks waste rocks
from the wash plant</i>

02:20.965 --> 02:23.000
<i>to a nearby dump site.</i>

02:29.655 --> 02:32.241
Right now, we're sustaining,
you know what I mean?

02:32.241 --> 02:34.655
<i>Put my camp up
on lien for Troy.</i>

02:34.655 --> 02:36.793
But there's gonna be
more payments in the future,

02:36.793 --> 02:38.310
<i>so north of
a thousand ounces,</i>

02:38.310 --> 02:40.068
<i>but I wanna go past
paying the bills,</i>

02:40.068 --> 02:42.793
you know, I wanna start
putting together some
successful seasons up here.

02:42.793 --> 02:44.344
<i>Right now, the name
of the game is gold.</i>

02:44.344 --> 02:46.000
<i>We need to get
as much of it as we can,</i>

02:46.000 --> 02:48.172
<i>as fast as we can.</i>

02:48.172 --> 02:51.758
<i>Rick's stockpile
will run out in a couple
of weeks.</i>

02:51.758 --> 02:54.000
<i>Before he can open new cuts,</i>

02:54.000 --> 02:57.758
<i>he needs 20 ounces this week
to cover costs,</i>

02:57.758 --> 03:00.137
<i>build up funds
for new equipment</i>

03:00.137 --> 03:04.103
<i>and keep
his gold mining dream alive.</i>

03:05.000 --> 03:06.379
<i>Taking a year off,</i>

03:06.379 --> 03:08.310
<i>it was good for me,
it was great for me,
it had to happen.</i>

03:08.310 --> 03:09.862
You know, I don't regret it.

03:09.862 --> 03:11.551
Because without it,

03:11.551 --> 03:12.896
I don't know what would
have happened.

03:12.896 --> 03:14.379
But that being said,

03:14.379 --> 03:16.413
this makes things
a lot more difficult,
you know what I mean?

03:16.413 --> 03:17.586
<i>There's trust issues
all around,</i>

03:17.586 --> 03:19.448
like, "Is he okay? Is he back?

03:19.448 --> 03:21.103
Is he fine?
Does he know what he's doing?

03:21.103 --> 03:23.413
Is he gonna [bleep] fail?"

03:23.413 --> 03:24.965
Well, I know
the answer to that,

03:24.965 --> 03:29.000
but you know, I still have
a lot to prove up here,
you know what I mean?

03:29.586 --> 03:30.655
<i>Especially, to my crew.</i>

03:35.586 --> 03:36.827
Hey, Morgan!

03:36.827 --> 03:37.931
Can you move that stuff?

03:42.068 --> 03:43.655
I'm definitely
Rick's favorite.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.000
Holy

04:19.931 --> 04:20.896
Oh, man!

04:20.896 --> 04:23.103
It's smoking like a

04:23.103 --> 04:24.206
Dude, and it stinks.

04:26.482 --> 04:27.793
I can see it from up there.

04:30.448 --> 04:31.448
Great!

04:46.620 --> 04:47.655
Check the oil.

04:51.172 --> 04:52.482
Look at that

04:55.689 --> 04:56.965
Yeah, she's shot.

04:58.206 --> 04:59.551
That's the
head gasket.

05:02.310 --> 05:03.896
Yeah, oil ain't supposed
to look like that.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.068
In layman's terms,
she's

05:12.965 --> 05:16.034
<i>Rick's
460 horsepower pump</i>

05:16.034 --> 05:18.344
<i>is seized up
and stopped working.</i>

05:19.827 --> 05:23.103
<i>The head gasket that provides
an air-tight seal</i>

05:23.103 --> 05:25.965
<i>between the cylinder head
and the engine block</i>

05:25.965 --> 05:27.551
<i>has cracked,</i>

05:27.551 --> 05:30.000
<i>allowing oil
and coolant to mix</i>

05:31.344 --> 05:33.413
<i>and the engine to overheat.</i>

05:35.172 --> 05:36.137
<i>To fix it</i>

05:36.137 --> 05:38.206
<i>would require a total rebuild.</i>

05:41.172 --> 05:42.793
That's pretty much
all she wrote. Right?

05:42.793 --> 05:45.275
That [bleep] oil has got
antifreeze in it,
we can't run it.

05:45.275 --> 05:46.896
Re-build the whole engine,

05:46.896 --> 05:49.103
we don't have the capabilities
for that here.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.000
No.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.517
No matter what,
in the meantime, we're

05:53.517 --> 05:54.862
Because I don't
have another spare.

05:55.517 --> 05:57.689
$200,000 pump.

05:57.689 --> 06:00.517
All I can think of doing
is start making phone calls.

06:00.517 --> 06:02.551
I gotta find
a new pump somewhere.

06:02.551 --> 06:05.862
<i>Rick's
in a catch-22 situation.</i>

06:06.586 --> 06:08.034
<i>Buying a new pump</i>

06:08.034 --> 06:10.655
<i>could cost him over 200 grand,</i>

06:10.655 --> 06:12.620
<i>money he can't afford.</i>

06:12.620 --> 06:14.206
<i>But with no pump</i>

06:14.206 --> 06:16.482
<i>to send water to the plant,</i>

06:16.482 --> 06:18.931
<i>Rick can't catch gold.</i>

06:21.827 --> 06:23.034
<i>Hey.</i>

06:23.034 --> 06:24.862
It's Rick Ness,
I'm up here in the Yukon.

06:24.862 --> 06:27.862
I run a small gold
placer mining operation.

06:27.862 --> 06:32.758
I'm looking for a pump,
ten by eight, ten by ten,
whatever you've got.

06:32.758 --> 06:35.551
<i>I don't think
we're gonna be able
to help you out here.</i>

06:35.551 --> 06:37.413
<i>I've got zero inventory.</i>

06:37.413 --> 06:39.413
<i>And all the guys around us,</i>

06:39.413 --> 06:42.137
<i>I would normally
steer you towards.</i>

06:42.137 --> 06:44.379
<i>I know that they're
all out as well.</i>

06:44.379 --> 06:46.000
Well, thank you
for the phone call.

06:49.655 --> 06:52.241
Oh [bleep] That's not making
me feel too optimistic.

06:55.034 --> 06:56.689
Everything is so hard
to come by up here,

06:56.689 --> 07:00.275
and then right now, it's just,
seems like everything's just
weeks if not months out.

07:03.379 --> 07:04.275
It's not gonna be good.

07:19.862 --> 07:23.793
Plans always have a way again
to screw it up. You know?

07:23.793 --> 07:26.310
<i>I was hoping to be sluicing
in three days,</i>

07:26.310 --> 07:28.724
and it's gonna be
more like, ten.

07:31.103 --> 07:32.931
<i>One hundred
miles west</i>

07:32.931 --> 07:34.482
<i>in the Klondike,</i>

07:34.482 --> 07:36.965
<i>Parker Schnabel
is desperate for gold.</i>

07:37.965 --> 07:40.000
<i>He has bet everything he's got</i>

07:40.000 --> 07:43.896
<i>on buying the $15 million
Dominion Creek claim.</i>

07:45.379 --> 07:47.413
<i>But five weeks
into the season,</i>

07:47.413 --> 07:49.413
<i>he hasn't mined an ounce</i>

07:49.413 --> 07:52.206
<i>and is fast
running out of cash.</i>

07:52.206 --> 07:55.172
<i>We're draining every
bank account,
till I get there.</i>

07:55.172 --> 07:57.862
We're hoping to still do,

07:57.862 --> 07:59.586
like 5,000 ounces this year.

07:59.586 --> 08:01.517
So...

08:02.793 --> 08:04.689
Still doesn't put us
in the green for the year,

08:04.689 --> 08:05.758
but it just...

08:06.551 --> 08:08.413
makes us be able to survive.

08:10.620 --> 08:15.000
<i>Dominion is a huge
seven-year long project</i>

08:15.000 --> 08:19.068
<i>with a potential
$160 million payout.</i>

08:19.827 --> 08:21.827
<i>But after buying the claim,</i>

08:21.827 --> 08:24.896
<i>Parker's barely got enough
cash to keep it running</i>

08:24.896 --> 08:26.655
<i>and risks going bankrupt</i>

08:27.689 --> 08:30.034
<i>before the gold
starts flowing.</i>

08:30.034 --> 08:33.310
<i>This ground is quite
a bit deeper than where
we've been mining.</i>

08:33.310 --> 08:34.413
<i>Nearly double,</i>

08:34.413 --> 08:36.413
<i>double the depth,
double the cost.</i>

08:36.413 --> 08:38.758
I mean, there's not much
we can do about it.

08:38.758 --> 08:41.655
It just comes down
to moving the dirt.

08:46.862 --> 08:49.724
Right now, we're just
trying to get down to some

08:49.724 --> 08:51.379
gold rich pay dirt here,

08:51.379 --> 08:53.172
which we know
is underneath us somewhere,

08:53.172 --> 08:55.000
but it's a ways down there.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.758
<i>In the money
pit cut,</i>

08:57.758 --> 09:02.068
<i>foreman Mitch Blaschke strips
worthless overburden.</i>

09:02.068 --> 09:04.724
We're trying to open as much
ground as we possibly can

09:04.724 --> 09:05.931
here at Dominion.

09:05.931 --> 09:07.137
Get this mud removed

09:07.137 --> 09:09.034
and get the gravels thawing.

09:09.034 --> 09:11.724
<i>I think the Money Pit
is gonna be crucial,</i>

09:11.724 --> 09:16.689
not only for our future
success here at Dominion,

09:16.689 --> 09:18.827
but for hitting
that 5,000 ounce target.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.000
<i>Parker needs
the Money Pit</i>

09:24.000 --> 09:27.275
<i>to deliver at least
2,000 ounces this season.</i>

09:28.379 --> 09:30.482
<i>Before he brings in
a wash plant,</i>

09:30.482 --> 09:33.896
<i>he wants all 40 acres
stripped and thawed</i>

09:33.896 --> 09:36.000
<i>and he's weeks
from getting it done.</i>

09:37.482 --> 09:40.620
<i>To get the gold he needs
to pay for it all,</i>

09:40.620 --> 09:42.862
<i>Parker has opened up
a second operation,</i>

09:42.862 --> 09:44.655
<i>ten miles south</i>

09:44.655 --> 09:48.034
<i>on ground leased
from landowners Ken Tatlow</i>

09:48.034 --> 09:49.310
<i>and Stuart Schmidt.</i>

09:50.689 --> 09:52.206
You know, the last time
we were down at Ken's,

09:52.206 --> 09:56.000
we had the good, the bad
and the ugly named
after a western movie.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.206
<i>He thought</i> The Unforgiven
<i>would be a good name.</i>

09:58.206 --> 10:02.793
So, we finally have a name
for the nameless cut.

10:02.793 --> 10:05.965
<i>In charge
of getting Parker's
first gold of the season,</i>

10:06.758 --> 10:08.103
<i>Tyson Lee.</i>

10:08.103 --> 10:10.206
<i>You know, when we came
down to Ken's this year,</i>

10:10.206 --> 10:12.000
<i>it was supposed to be easy,
it was supposed to be quick,</i>

10:12.000 --> 10:13.862
<i>but nothing's easy,
nothing's quick</i>

10:13.862 --> 10:15.689
<i>and nothing's the way
you think it should be.</i>

10:15.689 --> 10:19.689
<i>With Parker
throwing everything
its stripping Dominion,</i>

10:19.689 --> 10:23.413
<i>Tyson's been left with just
a 480 Excavator</i>

10:23.413 --> 10:25.172
<i>and two rock trucks.</i>

10:25.172 --> 10:27.103
<i>We have no spare parts
down here.</i>

10:27.103 --> 10:28.827
<i>We have no service truck
down here.</i>

10:28.827 --> 10:30.448
<i>We have no mechanic down here.</i>

10:32.517 --> 10:35.482
It's been me, Max and Tyson

10:35.482 --> 10:37.620
for the last few days.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.241
<i>It's not perfect.</i>

10:39.241 --> 10:40.413
<i>Originally,
when we thought</i>

10:40.413 --> 10:42.241
<i>there was only a little bit
of overburden down here</i>

10:42.241 --> 10:44.482
<i>but now that we realize
there's more overburden,</i>

10:44.482 --> 10:46.862
<i>we're falling further
and further behind every day.</i>

10:47.862 --> 10:49.448
Dig me a hole!

10:49.448 --> 10:50.655
<i>Last week...</i>

10:50.655 --> 10:53.206
[bleep] <i>I thought
he was gonna hit bedrock here.</i>

10:53.206 --> 10:54.517
<i>Parker discovered</i>

10:54.517 --> 10:56.517
<i>The Unforgiven cuts pay layer</i>

10:56.517 --> 10:59.965
<i>was far deeper than expected.</i>

10:59.965 --> 11:02.379
<i>Really thought
we were gonna have a plant
running sooner than this,</i>

11:02.379 --> 11:04.551
but yeah, not ideal.

11:07.965 --> 11:10.586
<i>And you know,
Parker is on his way
down right now.</i>

11:10.586 --> 11:11.965
<i>He's gonna take
a look at the progress.</i>

11:21.689 --> 11:22.896
This [bleep] cut,

11:22.896 --> 11:24.551
just the gravel won't stop.

11:26.344 --> 11:29.137
So much gravel
with no gold in it.

11:39.827 --> 11:41.344
Four colors at that level.

11:48.413 --> 11:50.448
Doesn't look like
he has any bedrock anywhere.

11:53.793 --> 11:56.689
<i>In the seven acre
Unforgiven cut,</i>

11:56.689 --> 11:59.793
<i>Tyson is digging down
through layers of dirt.</i>

12:00.689 --> 12:02.620
<i>The first and thickest</i>

12:02.620 --> 12:04.827
<i>is the worthless overburden.</i>

12:05.344 --> 12:06.551
<i>The second</i>

12:06.551 --> 12:09.413
<i>is the rocky material
known as gravels.</i>

12:10.517 --> 12:12.620
<i>Finally, the pay layer</i>

12:12.620 --> 12:15.724
<i>that sits on top
of hard bedrock.</i>

12:15.724 --> 12:17.620
<i>Gold is concentrated</i>

12:17.620 --> 12:20.655
<i>between the bottom
six inches of gravels</i>

12:20.655 --> 12:23.137
<i>and the top six inches
of bedrock.</i>

12:28.517 --> 12:29.413
Hey.

12:29.413 --> 12:30.827
Did you find any gold?

12:30.827 --> 12:32.034
I found four colors,

12:32.034 --> 12:33.689
like, right
at the ditch level.

12:33.689 --> 12:36.103
Yeah, I haven't hit
bedrock anywhere.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.344
When do you want
to start sluicing?

12:38.344 --> 12:40.965
We really need to get
down to pay in one week.

12:45.413 --> 12:47.793
Is the 750 coming down
at any time?

12:47.793 --> 12:49.551
You know, it would
speed things up.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.827
Ten to 12 scoops in a truck
with this thing

12:51.827 --> 12:54.344
and what would it be
with the 750, three to five?

12:55.172 --> 12:56.310
It's kind of busy.

12:57.137 --> 12:58.827
Oh, okay.

12:58.827 --> 13:00.724
Well, let me see
what I can free up.

13:01.344 --> 13:02.448
- You good?
- Yeah.

13:03.931 --> 13:05.103
Run, Forrest.

13:06.689 --> 13:09.172
<i>You know, a 750,
really would be nice.</i>

13:09.172 --> 13:10.241
It will speed things up.

13:10.241 --> 13:12.310
But it's just not
in the cards right now.

13:20.586 --> 13:22.931
That does not look normal.

13:35.310 --> 13:36.517
...it looks.

13:38.724 --> 13:40.137
Four-eighty's got

13:40.137 --> 13:41.827
a track pin that's ready
to break

13:41.827 --> 13:44.724
and it's the last thing
I need right now.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.379
If the excavator goes down,

13:46.379 --> 13:49.000
then this whole operation
goes down.

13:57.551 --> 13:59.068
<i>Four-eighty's got</i>

13:59.068 --> 14:00.793
a track pin that's ready
to break.

14:00.793 --> 14:03.068
I've radioed for help,
but it's a long ways out.

14:03.068 --> 14:04.862
They're at Dominion.

14:04.862 --> 14:08.000
<i>Tyson is racing
to hit paydirt</i>

14:08.000 --> 14:09.724
<i>by the end of the week.</i>

14:09.724 --> 14:12.586
<i>But his only
excavator is down</i>

14:12.586 --> 14:14.586
<i>with a cracked track pin.</i>

14:16.517 --> 14:19.206
Oh, here we go.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.862
It took us an hour
and ten minutes
to get down here.

14:21.862 --> 14:22.689
What up?

14:23.379 --> 14:24.379
What's up?

14:24.379 --> 14:25.517
Not much. You?

14:27.448 --> 14:29.931
So, is it, like,
snapped right off or--

14:29.931 --> 14:30.931
It's over here.

14:34.517 --> 14:35.758
This one right here.

14:36.517 --> 14:37.310
Oh, yeah.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.206
- That'll do it.
- That'll do her.

14:43.689 --> 14:46.689
<i>The track
on the 58 ton excavator</i>

14:46.689 --> 14:49.620
<i>is held together
by 52 coupling pins.</i>

14:50.896 --> 14:55.137
<i>One is cracked
and about to shear off.</i>

14:55.137 --> 14:59.275
<i>To fix the trackpad above,
the pin must be removed.</i>

15:00.482 --> 15:02.344
<i>The broken pin taken out...</i>

15:04.551 --> 15:06.172
<i>a new pin inserted...</i>

15:07.827 --> 15:10.862
<i>before the track is bolted
back into position.</i>

15:13.310 --> 15:14.827
<i>It's good to see
Ryan and Ty are here,</i>

15:14.827 --> 15:17.448
but at the same time,
now, rock trucks
aren't getting loaded.

15:17.448 --> 15:19.586
We're gonna have
to speed things up somehow

15:19.586 --> 15:21.310
or else we're in big trouble.

15:21.310 --> 15:23.000
This is where
the pin is broken.

15:23.931 --> 15:26.413
He caught it in a decent time

15:26.413 --> 15:29.172
before it's completely
fallen off.

15:29.172 --> 15:31.172
Either way we've gotta
fix the pin.

15:32.655 --> 15:33.620
Cut it.

15:46.620 --> 15:47.448
Okay.

15:47.448 --> 15:48.758
Put new pin in.

15:48.758 --> 15:49.758
Grind them off.

15:49.758 --> 15:50.862
Send her.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.275
I think I'm lined up.

15:52.758 --> 15:54.000
Send her home.

15:58.103 --> 15:59.034
Yeah, right there.

16:02.103 --> 16:03.172
Okay!

16:04.206 --> 16:05.689
Put the trackpads on...

16:08.379 --> 16:09.827
and then, just weld that pin.

16:10.448 --> 16:11.896
<i>So, it stays.</i>

16:11.896 --> 16:14.206
Then back to work it goes.

16:14.206 --> 16:18.034
These guys
have done a stand up job
on this excavator.

16:18.034 --> 16:19.931
I couldn't have done it
without them.

16:19.931 --> 16:20.793
All right, see you later.

16:20.793 --> 16:22.000
Driving off into the sunset.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.586
Thanks, guys, I appreciate it.

16:23.586 --> 16:25.275
Yeah, no worries, man.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.551
<i>After a six hour delay,</i>

16:27.551 --> 16:29.931
<i>Tyson is back in the cut.</i>

16:29.931 --> 16:32.655
<i>And the race is on
to hit paydirt</i>

16:32.655 --> 16:34.379
<i>by the end of the week.</i>

16:34.379 --> 16:36.931
The sooner we get
the overburden gravel moved,

16:36.931 --> 16:39.482
the sooner we can
start making some money
and getting some gold

16:39.482 --> 16:42.827
and paying off the purchase
price of Dominion.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.482
<i>Half a mile away,</i>

17:06.482 --> 17:09.103
<i>King of the Klondike,
Tony Beets,</i>

17:09.103 --> 17:11.103
<i>is finally getting
into a rhythm.</i>

17:20.310 --> 17:24.758
<i>Tony started
the year with a burst
of chaos.</i>

17:24.758 --> 17:28.620
<i>Spending big to open cuts
in Paradise Hill.</i>

17:28.620 --> 17:30.758
<i>Then, just weeks later,</i>

17:30.758 --> 17:32.275
<i>he risked everything</i>

17:32.275 --> 17:34.275
<i>moving his entire operation</i>

17:34.275 --> 17:36.379
<i>to his Indian River claims.</i>

17:36.379 --> 17:38.655
<i>And like Parker</i>

17:38.655 --> 17:40.965
<i>still hasn't mined a flake.</i>

18:11.758 --> 18:13.137
<i>There's just
one catch</i>

18:13.137 --> 18:15.000
<i>with his
Indian River claims...</i>

18:15.827 --> 18:18.482
<i>Tony is only allowed
to mine here</i>

18:18.482 --> 18:21.448
<i>on a restricted water license.</i>

18:21.448 --> 18:26.931
<i>He can't pump water
from or into the nearby
Indian River,</i>

18:26.931 --> 18:30.379
<i>so must recycle
all the water on his claim.</i>

18:36.034 --> 18:36.862
Yes.

18:41.965 --> 18:43.344
<i>Four years ago,</i>

18:43.344 --> 18:46.000
<i>Tony stripped
one of his prized cuts</i>

18:46.000 --> 18:47.586
<i>near his dredge.</i>

18:47.586 --> 18:50.344
<i>It has since flooded
with water</i>

18:50.344 --> 18:53.448
<i>stopping him from getting
to the pay layer below.</i>

18:54.206 --> 18:56.827
<i>Tony's plan for fast gold,</i>

18:56.827 --> 18:59.344
<i>pump over a million
gallons of water</i>

18:59.344 --> 19:01.241
<i>out of the flooded cut</i>

19:01.241 --> 19:04.000
<i>through a new
100-foot long pipe</i>

19:05.620 --> 19:07.310
<i>into the neighboring pond</i>

19:07.310 --> 19:08.724
<i>where the dredge sits.</i>

19:10.620 --> 19:11.965
<i>Once drained,</i>

19:11.965 --> 19:14.758
<i>he'll remove the final foot
of overburden</i>

19:14.758 --> 19:17.413
<i>to expose the gold rich
pay layer</i>

19:17.413 --> 19:18.517
<i>he left behind.</i>

19:20.758 --> 19:21.724
<i>Now, this is one
of those times</i>

19:21.724 --> 19:23.000
<i>where it'd be nice
to have Kevin out here.</i>

19:24.655 --> 19:26.551
I've been around watching
other people do it,

19:26.551 --> 19:27.931
but this is the first time
I've ever done it.

19:27.931 --> 19:28.965
Yeah.

19:28.965 --> 19:31.758
<i>First, Tony's
youngest son, Mike,</i>

19:31.758 --> 19:34.206
<i>must fuse together
five sections</i>

19:34.206 --> 19:38.241
<i>of 20-foot long
polycarbonate pipe.</i>

19:38.241 --> 19:40.310
<i>Where the pipes
are fused together,
you can</i>

19:40.310 --> 19:42.275
<i>use and abuse them
'cause they're pretty tough.</i>

19:42.275 --> 19:45.172
And we accidentally ran over
one with a D6
didn't do

19:52.172 --> 19:53.206
Keep pushing!

19:54.586 --> 19:55.379
Good!

20:16.827 --> 20:18.586
Now, here. Come here.

20:18.586 --> 20:19.931
Come here.

20:19.931 --> 20:22.034
I don't bite, I swear.

20:22.034 --> 20:23.862
You see how smooth
that is now?

20:23.862 --> 20:25.724
Well, you can see over here,
it's still a bit rough.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.931
Means I have to shave it
a bit more.

20:27.931 --> 20:29.862
We're trying to get this
as smooth as possible.

20:29.862 --> 20:30.862
And that makes it easier.

20:30.862 --> 20:32.137
When it melts, they fuse.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.034
There's a [bleep] art to this!

20:38.034 --> 20:39.551
It takes a little bit
to get it.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.758
It's not [bleep] cutting
on the one side.

20:56.758 --> 20:58.000
Like not even slightly.

20:58.689 --> 21:00.000
This seems pointless almost

21:00.000 --> 21:02.137
'cause these blades
aren't cutting.

21:02.137 --> 21:03.896
<i>A rough edge
of the pipe</i>

21:03.896 --> 21:06.482
<i>is stopping
the fusion machine's blade</i>

21:06.482 --> 21:08.172
<i>from making a clean cut.</i>

21:09.241 --> 21:11.103
<i>If Mike can't fix it,</i>

21:11.103 --> 21:13.206
<i>his pipe dream is over.</i>

21:14.931 --> 21:16.827
Do we have a chainsaw on site?

21:16.827 --> 21:18.724
It could be the weld.

21:28.551 --> 21:30.896
Well, we gotta do
what we gotta do
with what we got.

21:51.344 --> 21:53.965
<i>Now, the pipe
has a flush cut.</i>

21:53.965 --> 21:57.724
<i>The 400 degree Fahrenheit
heating plate is inserted.</i>

21:58.379 --> 21:59.517
We're melting the ends.

21:59.517 --> 22:03.275
After that we can...
we'll pull that out,

22:03.275 --> 22:04.758
then we'll fuse them together.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.931
You see in there,
right next to a hot pan,

22:06.931 --> 22:08.655
you see how
it's starting to roll?

22:09.137 --> 22:10.034
That's the heat...

22:11.413 --> 22:12.586
Melting it in a bit.

22:13.517 --> 22:14.896
<i>Joint complete,</i>

22:14.896 --> 22:17.586
<i>the pipeline is dragged
into place</i>

22:17.586 --> 22:20.310
<i>between the pump
in the flooded cut</i>

22:20.310 --> 22:21.586
<i>and the dredge pond.</i>

22:59.965 --> 23:01.586
<i>You know,
every layer we take off</i>

23:01.586 --> 23:03.034
<i>is a layer closer to pay,</i>

23:03.034 --> 23:05.862
<i>but I still haven't hit
bedrock anywhere in this cut.</i>

23:05.862 --> 23:08.241
<i>At the Unforgiven cut,</i>

23:08.241 --> 23:10.310
<i>Tyson Lee's skeleton crew</i>

23:10.310 --> 23:13.689
<i>has just three days to meet
Parker's deadline</i>

23:13.689 --> 23:17.000
<i>of hitting pay
by the end of the week.</i>

23:17.000 --> 23:19.896
<i>If they don't start
delivering gold soon,</i>

23:19.896 --> 23:22.448
<i>Parker could run out of cash.</i>

23:24.517 --> 23:26.241
<i>You know,
I get the urge to sluice</i>

23:26.931 --> 23:28.310
<i>my first day up here,</i>

23:28.310 --> 23:30.620
<i>but you got to be realistic.</i>

23:38.344 --> 23:41.034
Today, we have loaded a 750

23:41.034 --> 23:42.862
that's gonna go down to...

23:44.034 --> 23:45.620
<i>Ken and Stuart's.</i>

23:45.620 --> 23:48.482
We needed the 750
in every other place,

23:48.482 --> 23:50.206
but Tyson needs it the worst,

23:50.206 --> 23:52.000
so he gets it.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
<i>What do they say,</i>

23:53.000 --> 23:55.793
"The squeakiest wheel
gets the most grease,"

23:55.793 --> 23:58.034
so I guess,
we're greasing Tyson today.

23:58.034 --> 24:01.551
<i>And he's gonna be
one happy human being
when it shows up.</i>

24:03.965 --> 24:05.310
Yee-haw!

24:05.310 --> 24:06.206
Right on, man.

24:07.862 --> 24:08.965
How's it going, Jordi?

24:08.965 --> 24:11.034
I heard you wanted a big hoe.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.827
Thanks, man.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.620
<i>If we're looking
to get stuff done quick, fast,
in a hurry,</i>

24:15.620 --> 24:18.000
the 750 is one for the job.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.827
- No worries, have fun.
- You, too.

24:19.827 --> 24:20.758
I'll see you later.

24:20.758 --> 24:22.068
Come by and visit some time.

24:22.068 --> 24:23.482
Yeah, hey,
you should come by.

24:23.482 --> 24:24.655
Yeah, maybe I will.

24:24.655 --> 24:26.137
- Movie Night.
- Okay.

24:26.137 --> 24:28.758
I got a candle
with your name on it.

24:33.758 --> 24:36.827
Bye!

24:37.517 --> 24:39.172
<i>In a 750,</i>

24:39.172 --> 24:41.379
<i>Tyson can now load trucks</i>

24:41.379 --> 24:43.206
<i>four times faster.</i>

24:43.206 --> 24:45.241
<i>This will definitely
speed things up.</i>

24:45.241 --> 24:48.310
<i>And with an extra
operator in the 480,</i>

24:48.310 --> 24:50.689
<i>the crew now
has a fighting chance</i>

24:50.689 --> 24:53.000
<i>to hit pay
by the end of the week.</i>

24:55.206 --> 24:58.620
Oh, nice one, Tyson!

24:58.620 --> 25:00.896
<i>It'd be real nice
to have a 750 in the cut.</i>

25:02.310 --> 25:04.275
We can move trucks
a lot faster

25:04.275 --> 25:07.586
and we can have two hoes
running at once now.

25:09.206 --> 25:12.103
We are literally gliding now.

25:12.103 --> 25:15.310
I'd say it sped up, like,
three times faster now.

25:27.862 --> 25:29.448
<i>We've been down
for couple of days.</i>

25:29.448 --> 25:30.724
<i>Pump</i>[bleep] <i>died on me.</i>

25:31.517 --> 25:33.034
<i>At Duncan Creek,</i>

25:33.034 --> 25:36.620
<i>a broken water pump
has shut down Rick's operation</i>

25:36.620 --> 25:38.172
<i>for four days.</i>

25:38.172 --> 25:40.068
<i>But against all odds,</i>

25:40.068 --> 25:42.896
<i>Rick secured a lease
on a new one.</i>

25:44.000 --> 25:45.862
I expect the new water pump
to show up today.

25:45.862 --> 25:47.896
These guys really
helped me out here.

25:47.896 --> 25:50.034
Everybody else I called,
they're just laughing at me,

25:50.034 --> 25:50.931
like it was some kind of joke.

25:50.931 --> 25:52.344
I really want to get
fired up again.

25:53.448 --> 25:55.034
<i>We made a deal,
it was good deal for me.</i>

25:55.034 --> 25:57.586
<i>It's exactly what I needed
to get back on the gold.</i>

25:58.931 --> 26:01.517
That looks like
the pump guys right there.

26:01.517 --> 26:03.896
Yeah, that's a big
pump they're towing.

26:09.586 --> 26:10.482
How are you
doing, guys?

26:11.172 --> 26:12.000
How are you?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.310
I need a pump.

26:13.310 --> 26:14.206
Holy

26:14.206 --> 26:15.206
- Sean?
- Yep.

26:15.206 --> 26:16.448
Right on. Rick.
Nice to meet you.

26:16.448 --> 26:17.448
Nice to meet you. Devin.

26:17.448 --> 26:19.034
Devin, nice
to meet you, buddy.

26:19.034 --> 26:20.172
So, let's look at this thing.

26:20.172 --> 26:21.241
What does it hold for fuel?

26:21.241 --> 26:24.344
You should...
about 560 gallons.

26:24.344 --> 26:25.620
Right on.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.379
I mean, we're just about ready
to pop this new one in there.

26:27.379 --> 26:28.344
We'll give you a hand.

26:28.344 --> 26:29.655
I'll take it, extra hands.

26:29.655 --> 26:31.241
Absolutely.

26:31.241 --> 26:33.172
If it all goes well,
we should just be able
to sling it out of the trailer

26:33.172 --> 26:34.758
walk it down there, right?

26:34.758 --> 26:36.241
I got a safety rope
on that side,

26:36.241 --> 26:37.482
to get someone out of the way,

26:37.482 --> 26:39.413
- so they'll be able
to turn it for you.
- Perfect.

26:40.344 --> 26:41.689
I mean, the pump is beautiful,

26:41.689 --> 26:43.586
but, you know, the fact
that those guys drove it
all the way here,

26:43.586 --> 26:45.275
and now they're
gonna stick around,
help me get it set up,

26:45.275 --> 26:47.000
I mean, how
can I ask for more than that?

26:47.758 --> 26:48.931
The old pump is out.

26:48.931 --> 26:50.586
Nice to get the new one in.

26:50.586 --> 26:52.586
And make some gold
around here.

26:52.586 --> 26:54.172
Hey, Devin,
when you get down there,

26:54.172 --> 26:55.758
you guide Rick in, eh?

26:55.758 --> 26:56.586
Yeah.

27:03.034 --> 27:04.206
We'll,
drive that truck out.

27:08.586 --> 27:09.724
Swing her
this way, Rick.

27:16.793 --> 27:18.724
So far, so good, but...

27:18.724 --> 27:21.586
let's go take this
nice and slow.

27:21.586 --> 27:25.034
<i>The new pump weighs
over two and a half tons</i>

27:25.034 --> 27:27.448
<i>and costs $200,000.</i>

27:28.448 --> 27:30.068
<i>If Rick damages it,</i>

27:30.068 --> 27:33.379
<i>it will wipe him out
and end his season.</i>

27:35.965 --> 27:36.896
It's a heavy pump

27:36.896 --> 27:40.275
and we're going down
a very steep incline.

27:40.275 --> 27:41.862
So, I'm very aware,
that this thing can...

27:42.896 --> 27:44.241
point a nose over on me.

27:46.931 --> 27:47.758
Oh!

27:48.896 --> 27:50.379
It's so, so, so close.

27:51.931 --> 27:54.379
Taking it very, very slow,
very easy.

27:56.068 --> 27:57.068
Right.

27:58.965 --> 28:01.275
And once we got
the discharge line hooked up,

28:01.275 --> 28:03.000
then we can pick
the whole pump up,

28:03.000 --> 28:04.103
kind of put it
where we want it

28:04.103 --> 28:05.827
and that line will follow it.

28:05.827 --> 28:07.620
Some big stuff
we're working with here.

28:08.137 --> 28:09.000
We'll get there.

28:12.310 --> 28:14.413
We gotta get this
intake hose slapped on.

28:14.413 --> 28:15.896
Should be able to throw
the basket in the water

28:15.896 --> 28:17.689
and fire it up
and see what happens.

28:17.689 --> 28:19.551
We've been down
for quite a while now,

28:19.551 --> 28:21.655
waiting for this pump
to get put in.

28:22.793 --> 28:24.344
So hopefully,
this will do the trick.

28:31.275 --> 28:33.034
Ready to rock
and roll?

28:33.034 --> 28:35.827
So, we also have this
remote feature with the unit.

28:35.827 --> 28:36.689
Yeah?

28:38.034 --> 28:39.586
So, basically,
you just press this button

28:39.586 --> 28:41.034
and your pump fires up.

28:41.034 --> 28:42.896
That
is awesome.

28:42.896 --> 28:44.896
- I can do that
from up the plant.
- Yeah.

28:44.896 --> 28:45.862
Just press that button.

28:49.172 --> 28:50.689
I'm like a child
with a new toy.

28:50.689 --> 28:52.310
On top of what work
went into it...

28:52.310 --> 28:54.206
Oh [bleep] fancy words
again, buddy.

28:54.206 --> 28:55.517
I'm glad we could
help you out.

28:55.517 --> 28:56.448
That's fantastic.

28:56.448 --> 28:57.655
Yeah, I
appreciate it.

28:57.655 --> 28:58.724
We're back in business.

28:59.689 --> 29:00.793
Risky Business.

29:00.793 --> 29:01.793
Risky business.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.758
Now, let's get the hell
out of here.

29:04.758 --> 29:06.172
We've gotta get back
sluicing though.

29:12.862 --> 29:14.620
Yeah, Devin, go ahead,
throw some water at me, bud.

29:15.724 --> 29:17.655
I hear it coming,
I hear the water coming.

29:17.655 --> 29:18.931
Here we go.

29:27.310 --> 29:28.275
All right.

29:38.379 --> 29:39.413
We're back up and running.

29:41.413 --> 29:42.241
This is huge.

29:45.965 --> 29:47.655
<i>The three day shutdown</i>

29:47.655 --> 29:50.551
<i>cost Rick nearly $20,000</i>

29:50.551 --> 29:53.000
<i>in lost gold production.</i>

29:53.000 --> 29:55.413
<i>But with the leased pump in,</i>

29:55.413 --> 29:57.137
<i>he's back on the gold</i>

29:57.137 --> 29:59.896
<i>chasing his 20 ounce
weekly goal.</i>

30:16.034 --> 30:17.103
Who let the

30:27.655 --> 30:30.586
The... pump died,
the water pump.

30:44.103 --> 30:45.275
Shut the plant off.

30:46.379 --> 30:48.241
Just to save
a lot of problems.

30:50.689 --> 30:53.896
<i>Rick's brand new
pump has stopped working,</i>

30:53.896 --> 30:55.724
<i>bringing his operation</i>

30:55.724 --> 30:58.172
<i>to a standstill once again.</i>

31:06.103 --> 31:07.896
Yeah, well, we ran
the [bleep] pump out of fuel.

31:07.896 --> 31:08.724
Pretty stupid.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.000
Stupid on my part.

31:12.344 --> 31:13.413
throwing some fuel down here.

31:14.310 --> 31:15.344
Luckily, Buzz caught it.

31:15.344 --> 31:16.551
Now, we're filling her up.

31:16.551 --> 31:18.137
We won't make
that mistake again.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.103
And second of all, you know,
I was just testing my people,

31:20.103 --> 31:21.310
you know, "Hey...

31:21.310 --> 31:22.344
You know, is the pump ran
out of fuel?"

31:22.344 --> 31:23.310
Buzz caught it right away.

31:23.310 --> 31:24.137
Amazing.

31:25.827 --> 31:27.379
I'll get it started
from out here.

31:32.551 --> 31:33.344
Pump's fault.

31:34.517 --> 31:35.310
Let it go.

31:39.241 --> 31:40.379
The washplant's started.

31:51.206 --> 31:52.931
You know, if I'm gonna
hit thousand ounces,

31:52.931 --> 31:54.862
I need to continuously
be building this year.

31:54.862 --> 31:56.689
So, that means,
we need the uptime,

31:56.689 --> 31:57.862
we need the plant running,

31:57.862 --> 31:59.137
we need all the gold we can.

32:25.172 --> 32:28.931
<i>On a mission to get
his first gold of the season,</i>

32:28.931 --> 32:30.586
<i>Tony Beets has drained</i>

32:30.586 --> 32:32.517
<i>the flooded, pre-stripped cut.</i>

32:34.448 --> 32:37.448
<i>He now needs to remove
one foot of overburden</i>

32:37.448 --> 32:38.793
<i>to hit paydirt</i>

32:38.793 --> 32:41.137
<i>and should be sluicing
within a week.</i>

32:52.137 --> 32:53.793
<i>Stripping is easy.</i>

32:53.793 --> 32:56.172
Just take off all that crap
on the top

32:56.172 --> 32:58.620
and we find the layer
with gold in it...

32:59.241 --> 33:00.068
Stop.

33:01.586 --> 33:04.172
<i>Mike strips
the thin layer of overburden</i>

33:04.172 --> 33:05.724
<i>in the D6 dozer.</i>

33:07.034 --> 33:09.206
<i>And hopefully,
start sluicing next week.</i>

33:09.206 --> 33:10.793
I won't hold my breath

33:10.793 --> 33:13.551
<i>because, you know,
unexpected things happen
all the</i>[bleep] <i>time.</i>

33:14.896 --> 33:16.482
<i>I've been here
for a week.</i>

33:16.482 --> 33:19.068
And whatever Tony says,

33:19.068 --> 33:20.379
you're free to do,
you just give 'er...

33:20.379 --> 33:23.655
and hopefully,
it'll be a good time.

33:23.655 --> 33:25.862
<i>New hire,
Aaron Vanworkum,</i>

33:25.862 --> 33:27.931
<i>is in one of three rock trucks</i>

33:27.931 --> 33:30.241
<i>hauling the waste dirt
to the dump site.</i>

33:31.103 --> 33:34.517
I messaged Tony
on Facebook one day.

33:34.517 --> 33:38.241
And I was like,
"Hey, how do I get a job
to go out and work with you?"

33:38.241 --> 33:40.517
And he actually
responded to me

33:40.517 --> 33:44.172
and he just goes,
"If we're hiring,
I'll give you a call."

33:44.172 --> 33:45.965
Well, obviously,
the rest is history.

33:50.310 --> 33:52.448
<i>Well, that
is a cluster
but they're coming.</i>

34:05.586 --> 34:07.275
Oh, for [bleep] sakes.

34:10.862 --> 34:13.448
Hey, can you come give me
a pull, I got her stuck.

34:23.413 --> 34:25.862
[bleep] new,
this is a [bleep] mess.

34:28.241 --> 34:29.000
Stick her in.

34:31.172 --> 34:34.724
<i>Aaron's truck
is stuck in the middle
of the cut</i>

34:34.724 --> 34:36.724
<i>and it's causing
a traffic jam.</i>

34:44.793 --> 34:46.137
Make sure your depths
are all locked,

34:46.137 --> 34:47.551
and you slowly go with him.

34:53.137 --> 34:54.448
First dropper in.

35:35.137 --> 35:36.206
You're all good to go.

35:37.137 --> 35:38.620
You're the first one here

35:38.620 --> 35:41.275
in the Indian this year,
to get stuck.

35:41.275 --> 35:44.448
I kind of assumed
that I wasn't gonna be
the first one.

35:44.448 --> 35:46.517
But apparently, I was.

35:46.517 --> 35:49.172
And I'm not too upset
about it.

35:49.172 --> 35:51.344
I won't be the last
for sure this certain season.

36:07.517 --> 36:10.000
<i>Nearly six weeks
into the season,</i>

36:10.000 --> 36:13.034
<i>the Beets finally hit paydirt</i>

36:13.034 --> 36:14.137
<i>at the Indian River.</i>

36:21.103 --> 36:21.896
Yeah.

36:23.034 --> 36:23.827
Yeah.

36:29.000 --> 36:29.793
Yeah.

36:30.965 --> 36:32.000
Like mommy's necklace.

36:34.241 --> 36:35.689
<i>Tony gathers
the family</i>

36:35.689 --> 36:38.827
<i>to pan for the first gold
at Indian River</i>

36:38.827 --> 36:40.620
<i>in over four years.</i>

36:48.482 --> 36:49.931
I [bleep] hope so.

36:49.931 --> 36:51.724
Make it worth coming
back here anyways.

36:57.931 --> 36:59.965
You're gonna
help Opa pan?

37:02.448 --> 37:03.310
Do it.

37:09.931 --> 37:13.137
<i>Tony's hoping
the cut is as rich
as he remembers</i>

37:13.137 --> 37:15.827
<i>and wants to see
at least five flakes.</i>

37:17.517 --> 37:19.551
One, two,
three, four, six.

37:23.068 --> 37:23.965
This is gold.

37:24.965 --> 37:25.758
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:26.413 --> 37:27.413
Chunky stuff here.

37:29.517 --> 37:30.344
No.

37:35.931 --> 37:36.724
Yeah.

37:41.413 --> 37:43.413
It's nice coming back

37:43.413 --> 37:45.689
to know that we have
a cut prepared, ready,

37:45.689 --> 37:48.206
and all we need
to do is set up a box
and run that through.

37:49.172 --> 37:51.103
<i>Tony must now race</i>

37:51.103 --> 37:52.758
<i>to set up a wash plant</i>

37:52.758 --> 37:57.620
<i>if he has any hope of hitting
his 6,000 ounce season goal.</i>

37:57.620 --> 37:59.379
<i>Yeah, that's gold.</i>

38:11.275 --> 38:12.379
<i>Coming up...</i>

38:12.379 --> 38:14.000
<i>I'm gonna see
if we can find some gold.</i>

38:14.000 --> 38:15.793
<i>A pan
holds the key...</i>

38:15.793 --> 38:17.034
Just gotta
find Parker.

38:17.034 --> 38:18.586
<i>...to Parker's
future.</i>

38:18.586 --> 38:22.103
You are our only hope
for making any money
at this place right now.

38:22.103 --> 38:24.103
<i>And has Rick
got enough gold</i>

38:24.103 --> 38:26.482
<i>to keep his come back
on track?</i>

38:26.482 --> 38:28.655
Three, four, six,

38:29.103 --> 38:30.655
seven, nine...

38:40.172 --> 38:42.103
<i>Tony's got
a surprise</i>

38:42.103 --> 38:43.517
<i>for daughter, Monica</i>

38:43.517 --> 38:45.172
<i>and granddaughter, Jasmine.</i>

38:46.448 --> 38:47.758
Do you like
the wall, baby?

38:48.206 --> 38:49.172
What colors?

38:50.068 --> 38:50.862
Orange.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.448
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

38:53.448 --> 38:55.413
Well, we're gonna
live out here

38:55.413 --> 38:57.413
this summer and hopefully,
next summer

38:57.413 --> 38:59.827
and probably the one
after that, too.

38:59.827 --> 39:02.310
I mean, as long as somebody
will hire me, I guess.

39:07.103 --> 39:08.586
What color are you
gonna paint it?

39:11.965 --> 39:12.862
Yellow!

39:12.862 --> 39:14.137
Yellow?

39:14.137 --> 39:15.793
- Yes!
- Woah!

39:16.586 --> 39:18.551
You want the shark pillow?

39:18.551 --> 39:20.379
- No.
- Okay, we'll go
for the back then.

39:20.827 --> 39:21.620
Perfect.

39:23.034 --> 39:24.827
Okay.

39:24.827 --> 39:25.827
Say bye, Opa.

39:25.827 --> 39:26.793
Bye.

39:26.793 --> 39:28.655
- Love you.
- Love you.

39:37.862 --> 39:40.000
I'm in and out
of bed rocking areas, so...

39:41.655 --> 39:42.689
Just gonna take some pans

39:42.689 --> 39:45.241
and see what kind
of colors we see here.

39:47.827 --> 39:49.517
<i>After three days</i>

39:49.517 --> 39:51.655
<i>of clearing overburden gravels</i>

39:51.655 --> 39:54.068
<i>with the 750 and 480,</i>

39:55.068 --> 39:57.793
<i>Tyson has finally hit bedrock</i>

39:57.793 --> 39:59.413
<i>in the Unforgiven cut.</i>

40:03.724 --> 40:05.137
The majority of the gold

40:05.137 --> 40:07.931
is in the last
six inches of gravel,

40:07.931 --> 40:09.586
and the first six inches
of bedrock.

40:09.586 --> 40:10.931
But yeah,
let's do some panning

40:10.931 --> 40:12.344
and see if we can
find some gold

40:12.344 --> 40:13.448
and maybe make a dent

40:13.448 --> 40:15.965
in the big debt
Parker acquired.

40:18.551 --> 40:21.034
<i>The last time
Parker panned here,</i>

40:21.034 --> 40:23.724
<i>he only found
four tiny colors.</i>

40:33.137 --> 40:35.241
You can see
there's one, there's two,

40:35.241 --> 40:37.172
there's three, there's four,
there's five

40:37.172 --> 40:38.758
and there's, like,
ten in this pan.

40:40.034 --> 40:42.931
<i>More than double
Parker's last pan.</i>

40:42.931 --> 40:47.344
<i>A clear sign that Tyson
has finally hit gold rich pay.</i>

40:47.344 --> 40:48.724
Just gotta
find Parker.

40:50.000 --> 40:50.896
It's time to start sluicing.

41:03.517 --> 41:04.586
What's up?

41:04.586 --> 41:07.000
So, in the Unforgiven cut,
now it's down to pay.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.965
Just wanted to see
if it was all right with you

41:08.965 --> 41:10.965
if I start dragging Sluicifer
down there

41:10.965 --> 41:12.448
in the conveyors
and getting that set up.

41:13.379 --> 41:15.137
Do you want a wash plant
in there now?

41:16.793 --> 41:18.172
Yeah,
that would be good.

41:18.172 --> 41:19.413
Just be careful.

41:19.413 --> 41:20.551
- You know?
- For sure.

41:20.551 --> 41:22.137
Down there without
a lot of support,

41:22.137 --> 41:23.620
so if you need help
with anything,

41:23.620 --> 41:25.172
don't be afraid to ask
for some of these guys

41:25.172 --> 41:26.379
to come down
and give you a hand.

41:26.379 --> 41:28.275
- Okay.
- I mean, I rather not.

41:28.275 --> 41:29.172
Yeah, for sure.

41:29.172 --> 41:30.551
- What we're trying to--
- I...

41:30.551 --> 41:32.827
I would really like you
to be self-sufficient
down there, but--

41:32.827 --> 41:35.655
So, if I can take anything
off your shoulders,

41:35.655 --> 41:37.724
- that's what I'm here for.
- You are,
and I appreciate it.

41:37.724 --> 41:39.448
- No worries.
- You're doing a great job
down there.

41:39.448 --> 41:41.034
Thanks, man.

41:41.034 --> 41:42.931
You're our only hope
for making any money
at this place right now,

41:42.931 --> 41:44.103
so get that thing running.

41:44.103 --> 41:45.586
Yeah. Ten for.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.068
All righty, take care, man.

41:50.620 --> 41:52.000
I need people that I can trust

41:52.000 --> 41:54.310
and Tyson is one
of the top ones, you know?

41:54.310 --> 41:56.137
So, him getting Sluicifer
going down there

41:56.137 --> 41:57.793
would be a big help

41:57.793 --> 42:00.862
as far as keeping
this place afloat

42:00.862 --> 42:03.379
and get us making more money
than we're spending for once

42:03.379 --> 42:05.310
in this season.

42:05.310 --> 42:07.655
It's time to get Sluicifer
catching some gold.

42:21.586 --> 42:23.000
We were down
for a little while.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.413
You can't run without water.

42:24.413 --> 42:26.586
There's... you know,
what can you do?

42:28.275 --> 42:29.034
Well, hey!

42:30.586 --> 42:32.896
So, it doesn't look too bad
for, you know, the amount
of hours

42:32.896 --> 42:34.689
- that we ran through
this week.
- Yep.

42:34.689 --> 42:36.793
<i>Rick lost four days
of sluicing</i>

42:36.793 --> 42:40.206
<i>after his water pump
blew a gasket.</i>

42:40.206 --> 42:42.275
Yeah, it ain't much,
it barely covers
the bottom of the pan.

42:42.275 --> 42:44.586
But... the new pump
is a lot of money.

42:44.586 --> 42:47.068
You pulled that miracle
out of your ass
rather quickly.

42:47.931 --> 42:49.344
I got miracles up there, Buzz.

42:51.896 --> 42:54.896
Pretty [bleep] impressive.

42:57.931 --> 42:59.344
It had to be done.

42:59.344 --> 43:01.275
Well, it's a little
more fuel-efficient
and everything like that.

43:01.275 --> 43:03.241
Also, fuel-efficient
and we forgot to fuel it.

43:05.896 --> 43:09.310
By all rights, we should
have been down all week
if not longer.

43:09.310 --> 43:11.931
So, you know,
whatever we've got
I'm happy with.

43:11.931 --> 43:12.758
Yeah.

43:13.206 --> 43:14.103
Yeah, here we go.

43:14.931 --> 43:16.482
<i>To cover costs</i>

43:16.482 --> 43:19.068
<i>and build up funds
for new Iron,</i>

43:19.068 --> 43:21.000
<i>Rick's looking
for the stockpile</i>

43:21.000 --> 43:22.931
<i>to deliver 20 ounces.</i>

43:22.931 --> 43:26.206
Three, four, six,

43:26.206 --> 43:29.000
seven, nine, eleven.

43:29.517 --> 43:33.931
We're at 12.33.

43:33.931 --> 43:36.655
- 12.33.
- Nice.

43:36.655 --> 43:39.034
<i>Less than Rick's goal,</i>

43:39.034 --> 43:42.413
<i>but enough to keep fighting
another day.</i>

43:42.413 --> 43:44.275
That's still good
just for a couple days.

43:44.275 --> 43:45.620
It's just shy of 20 grand.

43:46.103 --> 43:46.965
Yep.

43:46.965 --> 43:48.586
Wish that pump was just
shy of 20 grand.

43:50.034 --> 43:51.344
But it wasn't.

43:51.344 --> 43:53.344
But we could have had no gold.

43:53.344 --> 43:56.482
Yeah. We could have had
no gold for a couple
of weeks...

43:56.482 --> 43:57.793
- Yep.
- ...if not longer.

43:57.793 --> 43:59.379
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

43:59.379 --> 44:01.827
Seventy seven
and a half ounces, I think

44:01.827 --> 44:04.172
is what our total is now
with that 12.3.

44:04.172 --> 44:08.068
Worth $155,000.

44:08.068 --> 44:09.965
That's...
I think that's great for...

44:09.965 --> 44:11.620
I mean, it's been
such a small crew.

44:11.620 --> 44:12.448
Yep.

44:13.482 --> 44:15.068
It's well over
100 grand of gold.

44:15.068 --> 44:16.586
And we're not even
running at full capacity,

44:16.586 --> 44:18.034
like, not even close.

44:18.034 --> 44:20.310
And we will be
at a certain point,

44:20.310 --> 44:21.310
that I promise.

44:21.310 --> 44:22.172
Mm-hmm.

44:22.172 --> 44:23.724
Guys don't get that
in a season.

44:23.724 --> 44:25.206
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:25.206 --> 44:26.793
We'll have to
up these, obviously,

44:26.793 --> 44:27.931
you know, to get
to 1,000 ounces,

44:27.931 --> 44:29.275
we'll never get there,

44:29.275 --> 44:31.103
you know,
with 12 ounces at a time.

44:31.103 --> 44:32.896
But if we keep hammering at it

44:32.896 --> 44:34.620
and we get few more
people here,

44:34.620 --> 44:37.137
some more machines we'll
up the tempo

44:37.137 --> 44:38.034
and more gold will follow.

44:38.034 --> 44:38.931
All right?

44:38.931 --> 44:40.068
- Hell, yeah.
- Thanks a lot, guys.

44:40.068 --> 44:41.206
- Thanks for the week.
- You're welcome.

44:41.206 --> 44:42.000
Cheers!

44:45.206 --> 44:47.034
Not a great week as far
as how much gold we got.

44:47.034 --> 44:49.103
But I got a monster
of a new pump

44:49.103 --> 44:51.241
that's gonna save us
for the rest of the year.

44:51.241 --> 44:53.275
And my crew
really came together

44:53.275 --> 44:55.034
which is good to see
'cause we really need that.

44:55.034 --> 44:57.551
And, you know, next week
we get more sluicing time,

44:58.000 --> 44:59.137
we get more gold.

44:59.137 --> 45:00.517
'Cause that's what we're gonna
need to hit 1,000 ounces.
