00:07.633 --> 00:10.083
(panting)

00:10.085 --> 00:11.968
(echoing scream)

00:11.970 --> 00:14.855
(echoing): Now, if I have a gun
in my hand and you shoot me,

00:14.857 --> 00:16.506
<i>then you killed me</i>
<i>in self-defense.</i>

00:16.508 --> 00:17.674
(yells)

00:17.676 --> 00:19.926
But what if I don't
have a gun, Detective?

00:19.928 --> 00:21.928
Please don't
let him kill me!

00:21.930 --> 00:23.263
WILDER: <i>But what if</i>
<i>I don't have a gun, Detective?</i>

00:23.265 --> 00:25.682
<i>But what if I don't</i>
<i>have a gun, Detective?</i>

00:25.684 --> 00:27.434
<i>I'm going to be</i>
<i>with you forever.</i>

00:27.436 --> 00:28.969
(gasps)

00:28.971 --> 00:31.405
(panting)

00:32.274 --> 00:33.523
What's up?

00:33.525 --> 00:34.775
Aren't you going to work today?

00:34.777 --> 00:36.660
Yeah.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.495
(panting softly)

00:38.497 --> 00:40.530
You okay, babe?

00:40.532 --> 00:42.532
Yeah. Yeah.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:54.630 --> 00:57.714
I hope I haven't been
keeping you waiting.

00:57.716 --> 00:58.882
Robert.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.017
I don't think
we've seen each other

01:01.019 --> 01:03.136
since law school graduation.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.022
You haven't changed.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.557
So what can I do for you?

01:07.559 --> 01:09.309
Um, I'm really just
here as a courtesy.

01:09.311 --> 01:11.311
I'm working for the attorney
general's office now,

01:11.313 --> 01:14.114
and I've been assigned
your brother Danny's case.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.282
What case?

01:15.284 --> 01:16.483
Thomas Wilder.

01:16.485 --> 01:17.567
No, that case is done.

01:17.569 --> 01:18.902
The shooting was deemed
justified.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.954
New evidence
has turned up.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.923
What new evidence?

01:22.925 --> 01:25.492
The Wilder family
submitted some audio tapes.

01:25.494 --> 01:26.660
Of what?

01:26.662 --> 01:27.878
I'm sorry, but
I can't really talk

01:27.880 --> 01:29.329
about the particulars
with you.

01:29.331 --> 01:31.131
Why not?

01:31.133 --> 01:33.300
Because I'm gonna
have to question

01:33.302 --> 01:34.468
you and your daughter.

01:34.470 --> 01:36.503
You were ear-witnesses
to the killing.

01:36.505 --> 01:37.671
It was self-defense.

01:37.673 --> 01:39.973
That'll be up to
the grand jury.

01:45.764 --> 01:47.681
(sighs)

01:47.683 --> 01:49.065
I don't have to
remind you

01:49.067 --> 01:50.901
that it wouldn't be
standard procedure?

01:50.903 --> 01:52.152
No, you don't.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.603
You sure you want
to do this?

01:53.605 --> 01:55.989
That's exactly
what I want to do.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.108
They're here, sir.

01:58.110 --> 02:00.193
Okay.
I'll take care of it.

02:00.195 --> 02:01.495
FRANK:
Grace.

02:03.866 --> 02:05.031
So good to see you.

02:05.033 --> 02:06.583
Aw, you, too, Frank.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.668
(door closes)
Louis.

02:08.669 --> 02:10.453
Frank.

02:10.455 --> 02:12.122
We got a beautiful day for it.

02:12.124 --> 02:13.874
(sighs) We did.

02:13.876 --> 02:15.342
Please.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.513
So, how's the academy
treating you, Louis?

02:19.515 --> 02:21.014
Treating me like
the rookie I am.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.549
You want me to pull
some strings for you?

02:22.551 --> 02:24.501
Would you?
No.

02:24.503 --> 02:25.719
Thought so.
(chuckles)

02:27.222 --> 02:28.471
How we doing?

02:28.473 --> 02:30.724
Good. Yeah.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.612
Okay, here's how this goes.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.064
We ride over together
with my detail.

02:38.066 --> 02:41.067
I give a brief talk
remembering Martin,

02:41.069 --> 02:43.703
the cop he was,
sacrifice he made.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.288
Then we unveil

02:45.290 --> 02:47.073
the street sign,
take a few pictures,

02:47.075 --> 02:50.794
and then I'd like to take
you both to lunch, if you can.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.797
Well, thank you.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.016
I can't believe
it's been ten years.

02:56.018 --> 02:58.635
You were all of what,
Louis, 11?

02:58.637 --> 03:01.087
Yeah. Seems like both
a lifetime ago

03:01.089 --> 03:03.557
and also just yesterday.

03:03.559 --> 03:06.059
Yeah, well, your dad
would be proud

03:06.061 --> 03:08.094
that you're following
in his footsteps.

03:08.096 --> 03:10.180
And selfishly, I am glad

03:10.182 --> 03:12.015
that this particular apple
didn't fall

03:12.017 --> 03:13.683
too far from the tree.

03:15.787 --> 03:17.571
They're ready for
you out front, sir.

03:17.573 --> 03:18.772
Okay.

03:18.774 --> 03:21.107
Honey, would you give me
a moment with Frank?

03:21.109 --> 03:23.276
Yeah. Sure, Mom.

03:26.682 --> 03:30.116
(door opens, closes)

03:30.118 --> 03:33.119
I'm sure it'll be
a lovely tribute, Frank.

03:33.121 --> 03:35.021
You've always been good
at the dedications

03:35.023 --> 03:37.524
and the eulogies.

03:37.526 --> 03:41.011
Something's on your mind, Grace.

03:42.848 --> 03:47.317
Since Louis joined the academy,
I've hardly slept a wink.

03:47.319 --> 03:48.802
Well, if he needs help
with anything,

03:48.804 --> 03:50.720
you know I'm just
a phone call away.

03:50.722 --> 03:52.689
I mean, you've been there
for every birthday,

03:52.691 --> 03:54.608
championship, graduation.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.226
And I am really
looking forward

03:56.228 --> 03:59.029
to graduating him
from the academy.

04:00.098 --> 04:02.232
I do have one favor to ask.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.352
Okay.

04:06.655 --> 04:10.106
Make sure Louis does not
graduate the academy.

04:10.108 --> 04:13.827
Kick him out, fail
him, disqualify him.

04:13.829 --> 04:16.096
I don't care what you do.

04:16.098 --> 04:19.916
Anything to ensure that
he does not become a cop.

04:25.524 --> 04:27.641
Where are we gonna put
all this stuff?

04:27.643 --> 04:29.142
We're gonna need
a bigger apartment.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.394
Sophie, favorite gift today.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.763
The nail pens.
The rainbow quicksand!

04:33.765 --> 04:36.349
You know we're gonna be cleaning
that stuff up for weeks.

04:36.351 --> 04:37.901
(tires screeching)

04:37.903 --> 04:39.352
Sophie!
(both scream)

04:44.159 --> 04:45.859
HELEN:
Sophie, no!

04:45.861 --> 04:47.444
Oh... oh, my God!
(car alarm blaring)

04:47.446 --> 04:49.446
PAUL:
Sophie!

04:49.448 --> 04:50.447
God, no!

04:50.449 --> 04:52.532
"Other than your parents,

04:52.534 --> 04:55.702
who is the most influential
person in your life, and why?"

04:55.704 --> 04:59.039
Joe. Because he encouraged me
to go for what I really want

04:59.041 --> 05:00.840
instead of what other
people wanted for me.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.375
Hmm.

05:02.377 --> 05:04.044
I think he recognized
that I spent a lot of time

05:04.046 --> 05:05.295
trying to make
other people happy.

05:05.297 --> 05:06.796
Not in this partnership.

05:06.798 --> 05:09.182
DISPATCHER (over radio):
12 David, be advised we have

05:09.184 --> 05:11.134
a 53, pedestrian struck,

05:11.136 --> 05:13.553
corner of Broadway
and nine-seven street.

05:13.555 --> 05:15.355
12 David to Central,
we're en route.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.890
(siren wailing)

05:22.731 --> 05:24.531
PAUL: Sophie!
JAMIE: What happened?

05:24.533 --> 05:26.900
This car came out of nowhere,
and it hit my daughter.

05:26.902 --> 05:28.668
Eddie, call it in.
Oh, God. Oh, my God!

05:28.670 --> 05:30.286
Central, 12 David,
we have multiple injuries

05:30.288 --> 05:31.738
at this location.

05:31.740 --> 05:34.240
Come on, Sophie, come on,
baby, come on, honey.

05:34.242 --> 05:35.575
Ma'am, you've got to calm down!
Sophie!

05:35.577 --> 05:36.427
She's unconscious?

05:36.428 --> 05:37.121
We're doing
everything we can.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.161
PAUL:
Helen, stay with Zach!

05:38.163 --> 05:39.546
(sobbing):
Oh, my God!

05:41.083 --> 05:43.166
That's him.
He plowed into us.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.251
That son of a bitch was driving
like a freakin' lunatic!

05:45.253 --> 05:47.137
Hey, whoa, hey, hey! Hey!

05:47.139 --> 05:48.888
Take care of your family.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.141
You all right?
Yeah.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.226
You guys all right?
Yeah.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.594
Yeah, we're okay.

05:54.596 --> 05:56.930
Were you driving?
Yeah.

05:56.932 --> 05:58.898
Where were you coming from?
(sniffs)

05:58.900 --> 06:00.817
Fund-raiser at the Waldorf.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.153
Have you been drinking?
No.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.571
I'm asking him.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.606
Not me. I wasn't drinking.

06:06.608 --> 06:08.441
Gonna need you to take
a Breathalyzer test.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.021
No.

06:11.045 --> 06:12.464
You refusing
a Breathalyzer?

06:13.448 --> 06:14.914
You feeling okay, Russ?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.200
I'm having chest pains.
I need to see a doctor.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.119
STILLER:
Yeah.

06:19.121 --> 06:20.754
This is Congressman
Russ Anderson.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.288
Who's under arrest for DWI.

06:22.290 --> 06:25.208
He needs medical attention,
Officer Reagan.

06:26.344 --> 06:29.129
You denying him
medical attention?

06:29.131 --> 06:30.964
Central, 12 David.
We need an additional bus

06:30.966 --> 06:33.216
at this location and
a patrol supervisor.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.185
I'll ride with him
to the hospital.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.719
And I'll be back
with a warrant

06:36.721 --> 06:38.755
for his blood alcohol.

06:40.542 --> 06:44.542

07:05.055 --> 07:07.140
So my son Sean, he's
into comic books now,

07:07.240 --> 07:08.929
and I get excited,
'cause I love comic books.

07:08.933 --> 07:11.103
But then I'm not allowed
to call them comic books

07:11.203 --> 07:13.003
because he's into
graphic novels.

07:13.005 --> 07:14.254
Like <i>Spider-Man</i>
and <i>Superman?</i>

07:14.256 --> 07:16.056
Oh, no, no, no. If only.
(cell phone rings)

07:16.058 --> 07:17.236
Baez.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.009
See, this is more
like the <i>Meat Puppets</i>

07:18.010 --> 07:20.844
and <i>Decaying... Zombies,</i>
whatever the hell it's called.

07:20.846 --> 07:22.596
I mean, there's no real
superheroes anymore.

07:22.598 --> 07:24.681
Just zombies and
blood and gore.

07:24.683 --> 07:26.516
Well, speaking of blood,

07:26.518 --> 07:28.184
we got a shooting
at a restaurant.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.986
Arthur Avenue and 123rd.

07:29.988 --> 07:32.439
One DOA, a second Vic was taken
to St. Benjamin's hospital.

07:32.441 --> 07:34.491
All right, you
take the hospital,

07:34.493 --> 07:36.526
I'll take the restaurant.
Detective Reagan.

07:36.528 --> 07:38.111
Hey.

07:38.113 --> 07:39.496
Get a word in private?

07:39.498 --> 07:41.615
There's no secrets here.
You know that.

07:41.617 --> 07:44.868
The attorney general's office
is reopening the investigation

07:44.870 --> 07:46.636
into the shooting
of Thomas Wilder.

07:46.638 --> 07:48.288
Well, they already
investigated.

07:48.290 --> 07:50.173
I was cleared.
Do you remember?

07:50.175 --> 07:51.875
There's new evidence.

07:53.295 --> 07:54.711
Okay.

07:54.713 --> 07:56.429
Here you go.
What are you doing?

07:56.431 --> 07:58.381
I'm modified.
I know the drill.

07:58.383 --> 08:00.433
Nope.
What do you mean "nope"?

08:00.435 --> 08:03.470
In this climate, the PC feels
that supporting his officers

08:03.472 --> 08:05.522
takes precedent
over standard procedure.

08:05.524 --> 08:07.941
Wow. Is that a quote?
That's the gist.

08:07.943 --> 08:09.693
Oh, so I'm <i>semi-modified.</i>

08:09.695 --> 08:12.779
Watch your step.
He's sticking his neck out here.

08:15.450 --> 08:16.816
(mutters)

08:21.657 --> 08:23.156
DANNY:
Hey.

08:23.158 --> 08:24.741
What do we got here?

08:24.743 --> 08:26.326
That's the dead guy.

08:26.328 --> 08:27.327
John Marino?

08:27.329 --> 08:28.545
Yeah, he owns the place.

08:28.547 --> 08:30.497
Where is he?
He's right over here.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.134
(sighs)

08:38.423 --> 08:41.224
(quietly): Son of a bitch,
what happened here?

08:41.226 --> 08:42.174
Shooter?

08:42.177 --> 08:43.176
In the wind.

08:43.178 --> 08:44.144
Witnesses?

08:44.145 --> 08:46.146
You would think, but...

08:46.148 --> 08:47.480
(groans)
But let me guess.

08:47.482 --> 08:49.432
Nobody saw anything.
Exactly.

08:49.434 --> 08:51.484
Yeah, I'm familiar
with the neighborhood.

08:51.486 --> 08:52.686
Who are those two?

08:52.688 --> 08:55.689
Father and son.
They work here.

08:55.691 --> 08:57.240
Great, let's talk to them.

08:57.242 --> 08:59.242
Either one of you
see the shooter?

08:59.244 --> 09:01.277
I was in the bathroom.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.445
Uh-huh. How about you?

09:02.447 --> 09:03.613
I was in the bathroom, too.

09:03.615 --> 09:04.614
Really?

09:04.616 --> 09:06.416
How many bathrooms
you got in this joint?

09:06.418 --> 09:08.501
One.

09:11.757 --> 09:14.457
BAEZ: Did your husband have
any enemies, Mrs. Marino?

09:14.459 --> 09:17.077
John was paying some mob guy

09:17.079 --> 09:18.845
$4,000 a month.

09:18.847 --> 09:21.231
He... he called it
insurance money.

09:21.233 --> 09:25.385
John was missing half a finger
on his right hand.

09:25.387 --> 09:27.470
The medical examiner said
it was recent.

09:27.472 --> 09:28.738
It was a warning.

09:28.740 --> 09:31.141
Because John said he
was gonna stop paying

09:31.143 --> 09:32.976
the so-called
insurance money.

09:32.978 --> 09:34.444
Can you tell me anything
about the person

09:34.446 --> 09:35.562
he was paying the money to?

09:35.564 --> 09:37.113
A name, a description?

09:37.115 --> 09:39.232
I only know his nickname.

09:39.234 --> 09:40.984
Roundface Bob.

09:45.323 --> 09:48.208
Robert Sava,
aka Roundface Bob.

09:48.210 --> 09:50.293
That's a very interesting
nickname,

09:50.295 --> 09:51.661
but I don't know who that is.

09:51.663 --> 09:53.913
Is that how you want to play it?
I don't play.

09:53.915 --> 09:56.132
Uh-huh. Where were you
Monday at 1:00 p.m.?

09:56.134 --> 09:58.835
I was home. Ask my wife.

09:59.971 --> 10:01.004
I will.

10:01.006 --> 10:02.472
How do you know John Marino?

10:02.474 --> 10:04.340
I don't know him.
Really?

10:04.342 --> 10:06.259
He hasn't been paying you
protection for the last year?

10:06.261 --> 10:07.310
Protection from what?

10:07.312 --> 10:08.678
From the Albanian mob.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.014
There's an Albanian mob?

10:12.350 --> 10:13.817
I thought that was
an Italian thing.

10:13.819 --> 10:15.902
Well, there's an Italian mob,
too. And an Albanian mob.

10:15.904 --> 10:17.821
There's also a police mob,
of which I'm a member.

10:17.823 --> 10:20.106
But we protect people
for free, unlike you.

10:21.359 --> 10:24.661
You know, I came in here.
I didn't have to.

10:28.450 --> 10:29.833
You got nothing on me.

10:29.835 --> 10:32.168
Hmm.
So...

10:42.798 --> 10:45.682
Good luck on your investigation.

10:49.471 --> 10:50.970
(sighs)

10:59.614 --> 11:02.449
(clears throat)

11:02.451 --> 11:03.483
Drink?

11:03.485 --> 11:05.318
Thanks, Pop, but I'm working.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.987
I know the difference
between working

11:07.989 --> 11:10.373
and just staring at a screen.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.077
(cork pops softly)

11:15.380 --> 11:17.330
When Jamie threw the curveball

11:17.332 --> 11:19.332
and said he was gonna go
to the academy

11:19.334 --> 11:21.217
instead of practicing law...

11:21.219 --> 11:22.585
Yeah?

11:22.587 --> 11:23.636
How'd I seem?

11:23.638 --> 11:26.422
The way you usually do.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.057
Damned hard to read.

11:28.059 --> 11:29.726
Yeah, but you read me.

11:29.728 --> 11:32.479
Well, you were up and down
all night for weeks after.

11:32.481 --> 11:36.232
And being a cop myself,
I understood the calling.

11:36.234 --> 11:37.684
Course you did.

11:37.686 --> 11:39.819
But what if I wasn't?

11:41.356 --> 11:43.740
What if I didn't bury Joe
as a fellow cop, but--

11:43.742 --> 11:46.242
I don't know...

11:46.244 --> 11:49.028
I ran a diner, a hardware store?

11:51.616 --> 11:54.918
And...

11:54.920 --> 11:58.371
what if Jamie were
all I had left?

11:58.373 --> 12:02.675
You're over the legal limit
for "what ifs" here.

12:02.677 --> 12:06.796
You remember Martin Edwards,
killed on Avenue A in '06?

12:06.798 --> 12:08.214
Sure, you spoke at his funeral.

12:08.216 --> 12:10.433
Well, his boy's in the academy.

12:10.435 --> 12:12.101
Oh.

12:12.103 --> 12:14.637
And his mother asked me
to fail him out.

12:14.639 --> 12:17.924
Well, it's not her call.

12:17.926 --> 12:19.893
Or yours.

12:19.895 --> 12:22.729
And if anything were to happen
to him, it wouldn't be on you.

12:22.731 --> 12:24.080
Try telling her that.

12:24.082 --> 12:25.381
I don't have to.

12:25.383 --> 12:26.950
It hasn't happened yet.

12:26.952 --> 12:28.968
Odds are it never will.

12:32.574 --> 12:34.490
Have your drink, Francis.

12:37.128 --> 12:38.995
You're on the right path.

12:38.997 --> 12:41.147
Best thing you can do
for the widow and her boy

12:41.149 --> 12:44.050
is to counsel them the way
you would counsel your own.

12:44.052 --> 12:45.802
That's not what
she's asking for.

12:48.056 --> 12:52.659
Do you usually get
just what you're asking for?

12:52.661 --> 12:54.010
Do any of us?

12:57.315 --> 12:59.515
(sighs) Less and less.

13:11.663 --> 13:14.664
Apparently, Mr. Wilder
kept a copy of every phone call

13:14.666 --> 13:16.249
he had with you,
Detective Reagan.

13:16.251 --> 13:17.617
So?

13:17.619 --> 13:19.035
WILDER (over tablet):
You found me.

13:19.037 --> 13:20.086
Very good, Detective.

13:20.088 --> 13:22.288
DANNY: You messed with
the wrong family.

13:22.290 --> 13:24.424
WILDER:
This may be true.

13:24.426 --> 13:26.259
What does "You messed with
the wrong family" mean?

13:26.261 --> 13:28.628
You know, it could have
something to do with the fact

13:28.630 --> 13:32.181
that he... assaulted my niece,
kidnapped my niece,

13:32.183 --> 13:34.621
was planning on raping
and murdering my niece.

13:34.622 --> 13:35.204
Danny...

13:35.228 --> 13:36.971
Which is why she was
stuffed in the trunk of his car.

13:36.972 --> 13:38.805
Danny.
I mean, is this a joke or what?

13:38.807 --> 13:41.774
I don't joke about
murder charges.

13:41.776 --> 13:43.192
What if it was your niece?

13:43.194 --> 13:44.894
Or your girlfriend
or your wife or your

13:44.896 --> 13:47.397
sister or your mother?
- Danny.

13:47.399 --> 13:48.898
You've been the subject
of numerous

13:48.900 --> 13:51.234
Internal Affairs investigations.

13:51.236 --> 13:52.485
That's not relevant to this.

13:52.487 --> 13:56.072
It is if I can establish
a pattern of reckless behavior.

13:57.242 --> 13:58.708
You've had civilian complaints
for excessive force...

13:58.710 --> 14:00.076
He's an active cop.

14:00.078 --> 14:03.563
If he was a do-nothing cop,
then maybe he'd have none.

14:03.565 --> 14:05.465
At one point in these
recordings, Detective Reagan,

14:05.467 --> 14:07.000
you threaten to kill Wilder.

14:07.002 --> 14:08.451
Now, when you said that,

14:08.453 --> 14:10.470
can you explain
your state of mind at the time?

14:10.472 --> 14:12.889
Did you mean you literally
were going to kill him?

14:12.891 --> 14:13.973
Danny, don't answer that.

14:13.975 --> 14:16.092
Why am I being treated
like a criminal

14:16.094 --> 14:18.561
for justifiably shooting someone

14:18.563 --> 14:20.480
who murdered 22 women
in cold blood?

14:20.482 --> 14:22.598
You are not allowed to be
judge and jury

14:22.600 --> 14:26.185
even when a suspect is accused
of murdering a number of women.

14:26.187 --> 14:28.321
He wasn't accused. He did it.

14:28.323 --> 14:29.772
He admitted it.

14:29.774 --> 14:31.274
I mean, what part don't you get?

14:31.276 --> 14:34.193
This guy is a sick
son of a bitch!

14:35.997 --> 14:38.831
Okay, and he orchestrated
this whole thing.

14:38.833 --> 14:41.084
That's why he recorded it,
to screw with me!

14:41.086 --> 14:44.620
We're not here to establish
why he made recordings.

14:46.758 --> 14:49.676
We're here to determine
if his death was justified.

14:49.678 --> 14:52.545
So, when you said you
wanted to kill Thomas Wilder...

14:52.547 --> 14:53.930
I meant it!

14:55.850 --> 14:59.802
And I'm glad that son of a bitch
is dead, okay?!

15:15.784 --> 15:17.267
Good afternoon.

15:18.520 --> 15:19.650
How'd it go with the A.G.?

15:19.674 --> 15:20.738
How do you think it went?

15:20.739 --> 15:23.323
Entire thing is a farce,
that's how it went.

15:23.325 --> 15:25.108
You can't lose it
with him, Danny.

15:25.110 --> 15:26.777
He doesn't play games.

15:26.779 --> 15:29.212
The whole thing is a game, Erin.

15:30.416 --> 15:33.350
Okay, I'm gonna explain
how this is gonna go down.

15:33.352 --> 15:35.335
Mm-hmm.
He's gonna play tapes

15:35.337 --> 15:37.571
of you and Wilder
to the grand jury,

15:37.573 --> 15:40.707
he's gonna bring up
that Wilder captured Nicky,

15:40.709 --> 15:41.942
that he was taunting you.

15:41.944 --> 15:44.344
He's gonna say that
you went into the clearing

15:44.346 --> 15:46.296
to shoot Thomas Wilder.

15:46.298 --> 15:48.298
Well, that's great,
because I did.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.967
You can't say that, Danny,
not even to me.

15:50.969 --> 15:52.686
What difference does it make?

15:52.688 --> 15:55.889
It's a difference between
being indicted or not.

15:55.891 --> 15:57.124
How does this work?

15:57.126 --> 15:58.525
Would you tell me
how it works, please?

15:58.527 --> 16:02.946
How does it work that a
scumbag murderer like Wilder

16:02.948 --> 16:05.148
has the same rights as me
or any other innocent person?

16:05.150 --> 16:07.367
That's what the
attorney general's office does.

16:07.369 --> 16:10.020
They look into police shootings
of unarmed victims.

16:10.022 --> 16:11.455
This isn't some
innocent motorist

16:11.457 --> 16:13.740
shot by a rogue cop, Erin.

16:13.742 --> 16:16.443
And this guy Wilder
is not a victim!

16:16.445 --> 16:18.829
So what's your solution, huh?

16:18.831 --> 16:21.915
Antagonizing the attorney
general is not going to be a win

16:21.917 --> 16:23.717
for anyone.

16:23.719 --> 16:25.335
It wasn't last time.

16:25.337 --> 16:28.004
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

16:28.006 --> 16:30.056
You called out
a serial killer

16:30.058 --> 16:31.091
on television.

16:31.093 --> 16:32.342
You played games with his head.

16:32.344 --> 16:34.227
So I'm responsible

16:34.229 --> 16:37.013
for him murdering
22 innocent women?

16:37.015 --> 16:38.598
I'm not saying
it was your fault.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.850
That's not on you.

16:39.852 --> 16:43.186
What is on me
is that this guy wanted to die,

16:43.188 --> 16:44.738
and he wanted me to do it.

16:44.740 --> 16:45.772
So I did.

16:45.774 --> 16:46.823
And you know what?

16:46.825 --> 16:48.825
If I had to do it
all over again,

16:48.827 --> 16:50.477
you better believe I would!

16:50.479 --> 16:53.997
Danny, you need to listen to me.

16:53.999 --> 16:56.533
You go into the grand jury
talking like that,

16:56.535 --> 16:59.786
you will go to trial for murder.

17:04.059 --> 17:06.460
You heard Detective Reagan
on the phone with Thomas Wilder.

17:06.462 --> 17:07.711
Wilder called

17:07.713 --> 17:09.212
Uncle Dan...

17:09.214 --> 17:11.381
Detective Reagan...

17:11.383 --> 17:12.933
on his cell phone.

17:12.935 --> 17:14.550
What did you hear them say?

17:14.553 --> 17:15.769
He said that he couldn't wait

17:15.771 --> 17:18.104
to meet Detective Reagan
again in person.

17:18.106 --> 17:19.689
Did Detective Reagan reply?

17:19.691 --> 17:22.526
It was hard to hear
his side of the conversation.

17:22.528 --> 17:24.694
What did you hear
Detective Reagan reply?

17:24.695 --> 17:26.530
It wasn't on speaker.

17:26.531 --> 17:31.151
What did Detective
Reagan say in response?

17:36.458 --> 17:39.042
He said that...

17:39.044 --> 17:42.546
if they meet again...

17:42.548 --> 17:45.332
only one of them
was gonna walk away alive.

17:47.169 --> 17:48.552
And that someone

17:48.554 --> 17:50.587
wasn't going to be Wilder.

17:50.589 --> 17:52.405
I'm sorry,
what was that last part?

17:55.677 --> 17:58.428
And that someone
wasn't going to be Wilder.

18:01.266 --> 18:03.266
Detective Reagan would be
the only one alive

18:03.268 --> 18:05.402
if they met again.

18:05.404 --> 18:06.603
He's my uncle;
Wilder had kidnapped me.

18:06.605 --> 18:08.021
What do you think
he was gonna say?

18:08.023 --> 18:09.189
Stick to the
facts, please.

18:09.191 --> 18:10.874
It was in
the heat of the moment.

18:12.211 --> 18:16.246
Detective Reagan said that
Wilder wouldn't walk away alive.

18:16.248 --> 18:17.497
Is that right?

18:18.467 --> 18:19.633
Yes.

18:19.635 --> 18:21.568
And did you
take that to mean

18:21.570 --> 18:24.054
Detective Reagan was going
to kill Thomas Wilder?

18:28.894 --> 18:31.928
In the heat of the moment.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.601
(softly):
Yes.

18:49.665 --> 18:53.416
You sure you don't recognize
any of the men in this picture?

18:53.418 --> 18:55.418
I'm sure.

18:58.290 --> 18:59.456
(clears throat)

18:59.458 --> 19:01.541
Why don't you man up
and grow a pair, huh?

19:01.543 --> 19:03.043
What?

19:03.045 --> 19:05.679
Come on.
It's just us talking here.

19:05.681 --> 19:07.964
Your old man's not around,
looking over your shoulder,

19:07.966 --> 19:09.633
telling you not to talk.

19:09.635 --> 19:11.251
I-I don't know what you mean.

19:11.253 --> 19:16.273
What I mean is you want me to
believe that you, your old man,

19:16.275 --> 19:18.942
and half the freakin' restaurant
were all in the bathroom

19:18.944 --> 19:20.060
at the same time?

19:20.062 --> 19:22.112
The only bathroom
in the restaurant,

19:22.114 --> 19:25.482
at the exact same time
that the shooter walked in?

19:27.202 --> 19:28.818
Y-You think I'm lying?

19:28.820 --> 19:29.986
I know you're lying.

19:29.988 --> 19:31.988
And you know that I
know you're lying.

19:31.990 --> 19:33.790
Come on. Ms. Furino told me

19:33.792 --> 19:35.909
that one of these men
came into the restaurant

19:35.911 --> 19:37.661
once a month to collect
protection money.

19:37.663 --> 19:39.829
You're gonna sit here
and look me in my eyes

19:39.831 --> 19:42.666
and lie to me and tell me
you've never seen them before?

19:44.336 --> 19:45.468
Come on!
(pounds table)

19:45.470 --> 19:48.088
Do you know
what the Albanians do

19:48.090 --> 19:49.639
to people who talk?

19:49.641 --> 19:51.141
They're not like
the Italians.

19:51.143 --> 19:53.476
There's-there's no code.

19:53.478 --> 19:55.345
You don't know
how brutal they are.

19:55.347 --> 19:56.680
Try me.

19:56.682 --> 20:02.018
A guy we buy liquor from,
one of our suppliers,

20:02.020 --> 20:05.939
threatened to go
to the cops about them.

20:05.941 --> 20:09.075
They stuffed him in an oil drum
and sealed it up.

20:10.662 --> 20:13.863
Guy suffocated to death,
nice and slow.

20:13.865 --> 20:15.832
You realize there's only
one person in the world

20:15.834 --> 20:18.201
who could protect you
from them right now?

20:18.203 --> 20:20.203
And I'm not talking about
your old man.

20:20.205 --> 20:22.088
It's the guy sitting
across from you.

20:22.090 --> 20:25.342
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

20:25.344 --> 20:28.094
Do you recognize
any of these men?

20:36.104 --> 20:37.554
No? Okay.

20:37.556 --> 20:39.889
You're too scared then to
stand up and do the right thing?

20:39.891 --> 20:41.024
Is that what you're telling me?

20:41.026 --> 20:43.276
You're damn right I am.

20:46.732 --> 20:48.948
Okay.

20:48.950 --> 20:51.234
Russ Anderson.

20:51.236 --> 20:54.237
Your blood alcohol came back
a 0.18, which is well over

20:54.239 --> 20:56.322
the legal limit.
What are you talking about?

20:56.324 --> 20:58.541
You're charged with vehicular
assault in the first degree

20:58.543 --> 21:00.293
and driving while intoxicated.

21:00.295 --> 21:02.295
You can't charge him.

21:02.297 --> 21:04.964
Why not?

21:04.966 --> 21:07.250
'Cause I was the one driving.

21:07.252 --> 21:08.551
What?

21:08.553 --> 21:09.753
I was driving.

21:09.755 --> 21:12.305
No way. You said that you
were driving the vehicle.

21:12.307 --> 21:15.258
And as you see from my
blood test, I was inebriated,

21:15.260 --> 21:16.910
Officer Reagan, and...

21:16.912 --> 21:19.179
as such, didn't remember
who was driving.

21:19.181 --> 21:21.264
STILLER: I wasn't drinking 'cause I was
the designated driver,

21:21.266 --> 21:24.067
but I'll gladly submit
to a blood alcohol test.

21:24.069 --> 21:26.770
Vic's father identified you
as the one driving the car.

21:29.074 --> 21:32.826
Then I guess it's our word
against his.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.749
Hey.

21:39.751 --> 21:42.202
Remember that family that was
in the back room having a party

21:42.204 --> 21:43.870
at the restaurant when
the shooting occurred?

21:43.872 --> 21:45.538
The ones that said
they didn't see anything?

21:45.540 --> 21:46.589
That's right.

21:46.591 --> 21:48.291
Well, they videotaped
the entire thing,

21:48.293 --> 21:50.794
only they forgot
and they never watched it,

21:50.796 --> 21:52.262
until now.

21:52.264 --> 21:54.347
(computer trills)
Take a look.

21:54.349 --> 21:55.432
Happy anniversary.

21:55.434 --> 21:57.267
Okay, now there's Marino,

21:57.269 --> 21:59.636
and entering the door
is the shooter,

21:59.638 --> 22:01.304
and just a few feet away
is Charlie.

22:01.306 --> 22:03.106
(gunshot, people screaming)

22:03.108 --> 22:05.475
Who was supposed to be
in the bathroom at the time.

22:05.477 --> 22:07.026
Son of a bitch lied.

22:07.028 --> 22:09.195
Big surprise.

22:11.983 --> 22:14.284
GORMLEY: "Louis Edwards
is a model recruit,

22:14.286 --> 22:15.952
"motivated and skillful.

22:15.954 --> 22:17.420
"He elevates those around him

22:17.422 --> 22:19.622
by helping any fellow
recruits who are struggling."

22:19.624 --> 22:21.991
You're not
making this easy, Sid.

22:21.993 --> 22:23.243
Instructors say
he's on a fast track

22:23.245 --> 22:24.961
to receive the Police
Foundation award.

22:24.963 --> 22:26.329
It's great for social media.

22:26.331 --> 22:28.198
Son walks in
hero father's footsteps.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.334
Mom's a hero, too.
She raised him on her own.

22:31.336 --> 22:32.787
I'll post that, too.

22:32.921 --> 22:36.172
Sid, I want you to go over
his application

22:36.174 --> 22:37.841
with a fine-tooth comb.

22:37.843 --> 22:39.776
To what end, boss?

22:39.778 --> 22:43.146
To see if there's anything
that could disqualify him.

22:44.483 --> 22:45.949
Are you looking
to disqualify him?

22:48.887 --> 22:51.387
I don't know.

22:51.389 --> 22:53.223
All right. I'll drill down.

22:53.225 --> 22:54.724
Once upon a time,

22:54.726 --> 22:58.161
the only requests I got
were for a certain precinct

22:58.163 --> 22:59.963
or Uncle Sal's shield number.

22:59.965 --> 23:04.033
Now I got a mother
asking me to find a way

23:04.035 --> 23:06.970
to stop her son
from becoming a cop.

23:08.707 --> 23:10.840
And once upon a
time, a detective

23:10.842 --> 23:13.843
under investigation would've
been placed on modified duty.

23:13.845 --> 23:15.245
And the detective in question

23:15.247 --> 23:17.814
has been investigated
and exonerated.

23:17.816 --> 23:19.849
I wouldn't be doing my job if
I didn't point out the risk...

23:19.851 --> 23:22.585
Maybe you should take
the afternoon off, then.

23:23.688 --> 23:25.255
...that should this
reach the press,

23:25.257 --> 23:27.323
you'd be open to
charges of nepotism,

23:27.325 --> 23:29.159
of ignoring procedure
in favor of...

23:29.161 --> 23:31.427
They could charge me
with protecting a good man

23:31.429 --> 23:32.562
from double jeopardy.

23:32.564 --> 23:34.164
I'll take that all day long.

23:34.166 --> 23:35.665
You won't get to frame it.

23:35.667 --> 23:38.301
Modified assignment
mostly protects the bosses,

23:38.303 --> 23:40.370
not the public in any sense.

23:40.372 --> 23:41.938
And the detective's last name

23:41.940 --> 23:44.707
has nothing to do
with my decision.

23:44.709 --> 23:46.442
And that's that.

23:55.287 --> 23:57.787
Charlie wasn't
in the bathroom.

23:57.789 --> 23:59.322
He saw the whole thing.

23:59.324 --> 24:00.390
You lied.

24:00.392 --> 24:02.158
Maybe we need a lawyer.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.493
You need a lot more
than a lawyer.

24:03.495 --> 24:06.596
Sava walked in there,
pointed a gun at John Marino,

24:06.598 --> 24:09.666
shot him, and then pointed it
at your son!

24:09.668 --> 24:11.067
Your son! Why?

24:11.069 --> 24:14.204
Look, I'm the one who told him
to keep his mouth shut.

24:14.206 --> 24:18.041
Why was this animal
pointing a gun at your boy?!

24:18.043 --> 24:21.945
Couple weeks ago, when Sava
showed up to collect his money,

24:21.947 --> 24:24.747
John told him
he wasn't paying anymore.

24:26.418 --> 24:29.452
Sava took a cleaver and chopped
off one of his fingers.

24:29.454 --> 24:31.221
And then he threatened
to kill him.

24:31.223 --> 24:33.723
Charlie was just
coming back

24:33.725 --> 24:35.291
from making a delivery.

24:35.293 --> 24:37.493
He saw the whole thing.
He was freaked out.

24:37.495 --> 24:38.895
Why didn't you call the cops?

24:38.897 --> 24:40.897
I thought Sava would kill him.

24:40.899 --> 24:43.299
He did try to kill him.

24:44.302 --> 24:45.902
And he's gonna try
to kill him again

24:45.904 --> 24:48.404
and again and again
until he gets him!

24:48.406 --> 24:50.673
Don't you
understand that?

24:50.675 --> 24:53.509
Where's Charlie now?
We got to get him in here.

24:53.511 --> 24:56.846
Wh... He should be home
from school by now.

24:56.848 --> 24:57.981
Good. Call him.

25:01.753 --> 25:03.052
(phone vibrates)

25:03.054 --> 25:05.088
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

25:10.262 --> 25:12.795
Please, you got to protect
my son. You got to save my boy.

25:23.273 --> 25:24.723
Anderson was drunk.

25:24.725 --> 25:26.784
That's the reason
he changed his story.

25:26.884 --> 25:28.322
Yeah, but if
Stiller's willing

25:28.323 --> 25:30.138
to take the fall for him,
what do we do?

25:30.140 --> 25:31.373
They know how to
work the system.

25:31.375 --> 25:33.242
I talked to the place where
Anderson and Stiller were

25:33.244 --> 25:36.745
coming from, but even if we show
he was in the driver's seat,

25:36.747 --> 25:39.331
doesn't mean he didn't pull over
and switch spots with Stiller

25:39.333 --> 25:40.949
before the accident.

25:40.951 --> 25:43.168
We need corroboration
he was behind the wheel.

25:44.622 --> 25:47.372
Both the airbags deployed
in Anderson's car, right?

25:47.374 --> 25:48.423
Yeah.

25:48.425 --> 25:50.008
Okay, where's the car now?
What?

25:50.010 --> 25:50.959
Where's the car?

25:50.961 --> 25:52.127
It went to the pound.

25:52.129 --> 25:53.212
Call them right now.

25:53.214 --> 25:54.763
Tell them not to do
anything with that car.

25:54.765 --> 25:56.381
Tell them we're on our way.

25:58.435 --> 26:00.686
♪ ♪

26:20.457 --> 26:22.908
Last call.

26:22.910 --> 26:24.493
Who did you talk to?

26:24.495 --> 26:26.795
I swear, no one!

26:32.419 --> 26:33.919
You know how airtight this is?

26:33.921 --> 26:35.387
Takes ten minutes,

26:35.389 --> 26:37.589
15 max,
and you'll run out of air.

26:37.591 --> 26:39.174
Please.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.643
Pack him up. (speaks Albanian)

26:41.645 --> 26:43.178
No! No!

26:43.180 --> 26:46.265
No! Please let me go!
Let me go!

26:46.267 --> 26:49.434
No! No! Let me go!

26:49.436 --> 26:51.520
Please let me go! Please!

26:52.606 --> 26:54.773
No, no! Please! Let me go!

26:54.775 --> 26:57.192
No! Let me go!

26:57.945 --> 27:00.329
Please! Please!

27:01.248 --> 27:03.282
Hey.

27:03.284 --> 27:05.250
Charlie was picked up
outside his high school

27:05.252 --> 27:08.120
by a guy matching
Sava's description.

27:08.122 --> 27:09.621
TARU tracked his phone

27:09.623 --> 27:12.291
to a 435 East Tremont Avenue,

27:12.293 --> 27:13.675
and the signal
dropped off there.

27:13.677 --> 27:15.627
Hold on.
Tremont, you said?

27:15.629 --> 27:17.012
Gang Unit Intel says that

27:17.014 --> 27:20.465
Sava's renting a warehouse
on Tremont.

27:20.467 --> 27:22.851
Right here.
Right by the Major Deegan.

27:22.853 --> 27:24.720
It's Detective Baez.
I need ESU to meet me

27:24.722 --> 27:26.805
at the corner of Tremont Avenue
and the Major Deegan.

27:26.807 --> 27:27.856
We're hitting a warehouse.

27:27.858 --> 27:29.358
The Albanian mob

27:29.360 --> 27:30.809
is holding a hostage.

27:30.811 --> 27:32.444
Vest up.

27:39.370 --> 27:42.037
(officers shouting)

27:42.039 --> 27:44.156
Go, go, go!
Move it, move it!

27:44.158 --> 27:47.075
Come on! We're gonna go deep
and sweep around!

27:51.832 --> 27:53.665
I'll be right there.

27:53.667 --> 27:55.667
You, stay on me.

27:55.669 --> 27:57.886
(Charlie banging, screaming)

27:59.340 --> 28:01.506
(gasping)

28:09.650 --> 28:11.183
Sava!

28:23.030 --> 28:24.896
(bang)

28:24.898 --> 28:26.365
(grunts)

28:39.763 --> 28:40.929
Where's the kid?

28:40.931 --> 28:41.880
Where is he?!

28:41.882 --> 28:43.382
Doesn't matter, Detective.

28:43.384 --> 28:45.300
(panting)

28:46.186 --> 28:48.103
You son of a bitch.
(grunts)

28:48.105 --> 28:49.388
You put him in a barrel?

28:49.390 --> 28:51.857
Huh? Which one?

28:52.860 --> 28:55.060
I said, which one?!
You son of a bitch.

28:55.062 --> 28:56.278
Charlie!

28:56.280 --> 28:57.979
What do you want to do?

28:57.981 --> 29:00.649
You want to shoot me?
I'm unarmed.

29:03.070 --> 29:05.320
Well, now I'm unarmed, too.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.539
Huh?

29:08.459 --> 29:09.741
Charlie!

29:09.743 --> 29:11.126
Watch him.

29:11.128 --> 29:14.046
Charlie! Charlie?

29:17.918 --> 29:19.084
Charlie!

29:20.587 --> 29:22.170
Charlie!

29:27.261 --> 29:29.144
Charlie!

29:29.146 --> 29:30.979
(bang)

29:38.906 --> 29:40.155
(muffled banging)

29:40.157 --> 29:41.156
Charlie?

29:41.158 --> 29:42.607
(grunting)

29:42.609 --> 29:44.659
(whispers):
Damn it.

29:45.779 --> 29:47.062
(grunts)

29:48.031 --> 29:49.998
(gasping)
All right.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.783
Come on.

29:51.785 --> 29:53.452
All right.
(wheezing)

29:53.454 --> 29:54.453
Nice and slow.

29:54.455 --> 29:56.254
Breathe. Breathe.

29:56.256 --> 29:59.107
I need a bus!

30:09.436 --> 30:11.470
What happened
to your hand?

30:11.472 --> 30:12.888
Work-related injury.

30:12.890 --> 30:14.773
(scoffs) Thought you
were riding a desk.

30:14.775 --> 30:15.974
Yeah, well, I'm not.

30:15.976 --> 30:17.476
LINDA: He's supposed to be.
DANNY: Yeah.

30:17.478 --> 30:20.145
That is, until I'm cleared
for shooting a mass murderer.

30:20.147 --> 30:21.646
FRANK: The state
attorney general

30:21.648 --> 30:23.281
fulfilling his new mandate.

30:23.283 --> 30:24.232
Ah.

30:24.234 --> 30:25.283
But it sucks.

30:25.285 --> 30:26.485
FRANK:
Yeah, that's one way to put it,

30:26.487 --> 30:28.153
but not at the dinner table.

30:28.155 --> 30:30.238
Tell you what sucks.
Sorry, stinks.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.323
Is people gaming the system.

30:31.325 --> 30:33.158
You might be on the hot seat
right now, Danny,

30:33.160 --> 30:34.926
but at least you got a killer
off the streets.

30:34.928 --> 30:37.078
Yeah, but at what
personal cost?

30:37.080 --> 30:39.831
Everything worthwhile
has personal cost.

30:41.335 --> 30:43.552
Who's fault is it anyway
that half the family is cops?

30:43.554 --> 30:45.504
That'd be my father.

30:45.506 --> 30:47.556
He couldn't have been
a doctor or an accountant?

30:47.558 --> 30:49.057
Something that doesn't
involve firearms?

30:49.059 --> 30:51.676
Family dinner would be
a lot less interesting.

30:51.678 --> 30:54.513
Well, given what I just had to
go through with the grand jury,

30:54.515 --> 30:57.065
I'd take "a lot less
interesting" any day.

31:01.572 --> 31:04.773
Sorry you had to
go through that.

31:08.195 --> 31:11.413
You know, there's a whole
other world out there, boys.

31:11.415 --> 31:12.814
HENRY: One that
would have a lot more

31:12.816 --> 31:16.034
thugs on the street were it not
for families like ours.

31:16.036 --> 31:17.869
Well, I'm just saying, Pop.

31:17.871 --> 31:20.372
None of us had to become cops.

31:20.374 --> 31:24.125
It's not a birthright
or a genetic code.

31:24.127 --> 31:26.811
It's a choice.

31:40.444 --> 31:42.611
He's waiting for you.

31:52.656 --> 31:54.322
(sighs)

31:57.294 --> 31:59.027
Thanks for coming up, Louis.

32:00.631 --> 32:01.663
Lookin' good.

32:01.665 --> 32:03.131
(chuckles) Feelin' good.

32:03.133 --> 32:04.416
Sit down.

32:04.418 --> 32:06.585
Oh. Thanks, Frank.

32:06.587 --> 32:09.004
I mean, Commissioner.

32:09.006 --> 32:10.755
I mean, what's the protocol?

32:10.757 --> 32:13.174
Commissioner
in front of the troops,

32:13.176 --> 32:14.709
Frank when it's just us.

32:14.711 --> 32:17.145
I'm used to you
being the guy cheering me on

32:17.147 --> 32:18.980
from the sidelines
at the Little League games,

32:18.982 --> 32:21.149
not the boss of the
whole department.

32:21.151 --> 32:23.602
I'll always be
cheering you on, Louis.

32:23.604 --> 32:24.853
That's a given.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.988
Thank you, sir.

32:26.990 --> 32:28.023
Frank.

32:28.025 --> 32:31.326
I'm gonna ask you a question.

32:31.328 --> 32:33.361
Yeah. Shoot.

32:35.198 --> 32:37.749
Why do you want to become a cop?

32:37.751 --> 32:39.784
I, uh... (chuckles)

32:39.786 --> 32:41.169
I've always wanted to.

32:41.171 --> 32:42.537
That's not a reason.

32:43.423 --> 32:45.423
Not sure I understand.

32:45.425 --> 32:47.759
I want to know why
you want to become a cop.

32:47.761 --> 32:49.427
You've always
gotten great grades,

32:49.429 --> 32:51.563
all through school, every honor.

32:51.565 --> 32:53.348
You could get a job anywhere.

32:53.350 --> 32:55.934
I don't want a job anywhere.

32:55.936 --> 32:57.802
I want to be an NYPD cop.

32:57.804 --> 33:00.522
Because that's what
your father did?

33:00.524 --> 33:03.141
That's environmental,
that's sentimental.

33:03.143 --> 33:05.894
That's different from
a real determination.

33:08.732 --> 33:10.782
Did my mom put you up to this?

33:10.784 --> 33:12.484
No.

33:14.488 --> 33:17.372
Yes.

33:17.374 --> 33:20.458
Thank you.

33:20.460 --> 33:21.960
So I'll tell you why.

33:21.962 --> 33:23.378
'Cause my father used
to tell me stories

33:23.380 --> 33:25.630
from the time I could walk

33:25.632 --> 33:29.000
about being on
patrol, and...

33:29.002 --> 33:30.385
I thought,

33:30.387 --> 33:33.505
even back then,

33:33.507 --> 33:36.925
that's not a job,
that's a mission.

33:36.927 --> 33:39.010
Don't romanticize it.

33:39.012 --> 33:41.229
And after my dad got killed...

33:43.767 --> 33:47.652
...the only consistent
role model that I had,

33:47.654 --> 33:51.523
the one man who showed up
to every event in my life,

33:51.525 --> 33:55.360
who had more integrity
than any person I've met,

33:55.362 --> 33:57.662
made that choice clearer for me.

34:00.167 --> 34:03.535
And now that man
is questioning me

34:03.537 --> 34:06.004
about the one thing...

34:06.006 --> 34:08.422
the one thing
I've always been sure of.

34:10.627 --> 34:13.634
That I want to be on the job
with the NYPD.

34:26.327 --> 34:27.817
WILDER: You've got
a pretty wife.

34:27.841 --> 34:29.134
DANNY:
What'd you say?

34:29.158 --> 34:30.998
WILDER: She left
this morning at 8:05.

34:31.022 --> 34:33.779
And your two boys.
I left at 8.

34:34.004 --> 34:35.337
DANNY:
I will kill you. You hear me?

34:35.339 --> 34:37.054
I said I will kill you!

34:37.056 --> 34:38.257
WILDER:
You have a good day, Detective.

34:38.259 --> 34:39.507
DANNY:
Hey!

34:43.347 --> 34:46.732
You said you were going to kill
Thomas Wilder, is that right?

34:46.734 --> 34:48.183
That's what it sounded like.

34:48.185 --> 34:50.068
You don't remember?

34:50.070 --> 34:52.237
I remember everything
about Thomas Wilder.

34:52.239 --> 34:54.523
Because he got under your skin?

34:54.525 --> 34:56.024
Yes, he did.

34:56.025 --> 34:57.074
Why?

34:57.077 --> 34:59.361
Because he brutally murdered

34:59.363 --> 35:01.196
22 innocent young women.

35:01.198 --> 35:02.748
Because I had to tell

35:02.750 --> 35:04.449
more than one of the mothers
of those women

35:04.451 --> 35:06.702
that they will never see
their daughter again,

35:06.704 --> 35:11.256
because I had to look at the way
he tortured and murdered them.

35:12.376 --> 35:14.543
And that's something
that I will never forget.

35:16.297 --> 35:17.846
So, would it be safe to say

35:17.848 --> 35:20.883
that you were taking
this case personally?

35:20.885 --> 35:22.568
I take every case personally.

35:22.570 --> 35:24.887
Wilder had no history
of using a gun.

35:24.889 --> 35:26.054
Is that correct?

35:27.725 --> 35:30.726
No, he did not use a gun
on his victims.

35:32.062 --> 35:34.463
Did he have any record
of owning a gun?

35:34.465 --> 35:36.815
I have no idea.

35:38.068 --> 35:40.569
And yet, you say you shot him

35:40.571 --> 35:43.238
because you weren't sure
if he had a gun.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.407
He was wearing a police uniform.

35:45.409 --> 35:48.210
He said that he had a gun
behind his back.

35:48.212 --> 35:50.295
Why would he tell you
he had a gun if he didn't?

35:50.297 --> 35:52.080
You will have to ask him that.

35:52.082 --> 35:54.416
So, if he had no history
of owning a gun

35:54.418 --> 35:56.051
and he had no history
of using a gun,

35:56.053 --> 35:58.837
why would you assume
that he was going to shoot you?

35:58.839 --> 36:00.923
DANNY: Because the
last time I saw him,

36:00.925 --> 36:03.842
he tried to beat me to death
with a crowbar.

36:06.263 --> 36:09.898
Now, if somebody did that to me,
I'd be looking for revenge.

36:09.900 --> 36:11.266
So is that why you shot him,

36:11.268 --> 36:14.102
because you were
looking for revenge?

36:20.110 --> 36:22.160
Can I stand up, please?

36:24.498 --> 36:26.832
Okay.

36:29.620 --> 36:30.869
(clears throat)

36:34.792 --> 36:37.042
Okay. (sighs)

36:38.379 --> 36:42.631
So, I'm Wilder...
and you guys are me.

36:43.801 --> 36:46.768
And we're about this far apart.

36:46.770 --> 36:48.253
And you have your gun

36:48.255 --> 36:51.306
<i>pointed at me, and I am</i>

36:51.308 --> 36:52.574
standing in front of you

36:52.576 --> 36:55.894
<i>with my hands behind my back,</i>
<i>just like this.</i>

36:55.896 --> 36:58.864
And it's very quiet.

36:58.866 --> 37:00.666
And there's nobody around,

37:00.668 --> 37:02.317
<i>nobody except</i>

37:02.319 --> 37:05.988
us two, standing here alone
in this clearing.

37:07.741 --> 37:11.293
And you're looking at me,
the man who murdered,

37:11.295 --> 37:15.213
tortured and raped
22 innocent women...

37:16.717 --> 37:20.919
...who left them
to rot on the ground...

37:22.556 --> 37:25.891
...with their hands crossed
over their chest.

37:25.893 --> 37:29.344
And I tell you
I got a gun behind my back.

37:29.346 --> 37:32.180
So you instruct me...

37:32.182 --> 37:34.766
to show you my hands.

37:34.768 --> 37:37.102
And I don't comply.

37:38.238 --> 37:40.522
So you instruct me again.

37:40.524 --> 37:41.940
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

37:41.942 --> 37:46.161
Only louder this time,
to show you my hands.

37:46.163 --> 37:48.864
I said keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

37:48.866 --> 37:51.116
And I don't comply.

37:51.118 --> 37:52.968
I've told you
I have a gun

37:52.970 --> 37:54.503
behind my back.

37:54.505 --> 37:58.173
You have no idea
whether I do or I don't.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.760
And then... bang!

38:02.880 --> 38:04.579
(jurors gasp)

38:04.581 --> 38:07.549
Now given that...

38:09.937 --> 38:12.054
...would you fire your weapon?

38:32.743 --> 38:34.409
(sighs)

38:41.919 --> 38:43.251
Thank you, Baker.

38:43.253 --> 38:45.420
Grace, please,
sit with me.

38:48.308 --> 38:51.076
Uh, can I get you anything?
You want some coffee?

38:51.078 --> 38:52.761
Uh, no, I'm good.

38:52.763 --> 38:55.263
Okay, I looked
into Louis's file,

38:55.265 --> 38:58.767
trying to find a way to
legitimately fail him out.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.385
Oh, thank you.

39:00.387 --> 39:02.187
I looked hard.

39:03.657 --> 39:07.859
What you asked me to do
is essentially act

39:07.861 --> 39:09.744
as his father would.

39:11.081 --> 39:13.248
I think I did.

39:14.585 --> 39:17.285
I sat with him.
I talked to him.

39:17.287 --> 39:18.787
And?

39:18.789 --> 39:21.957
Well, more importantly,

39:21.959 --> 39:26.044
(sighs) I listened to him.

39:26.046 --> 39:28.296
Grace, it's what he wants to do.

39:28.298 --> 39:31.216
Says... he wants, Frank.

39:31.218 --> 39:32.217
He's still young.

39:32.219 --> 39:34.669
Old enough to act,
free to choose.

39:39.526 --> 39:43.145
I need cops like him.
I will not fail him out.

39:45.032 --> 39:47.616
It's not enough
that I lost my husband?

39:47.618 --> 39:50.702
Martin would be proud of him;
I think you know that.

39:50.704 --> 39:53.788
He romanticizes the PD because
of Martin and because of you.

39:53.790 --> 39:55.323
I warned him of that, Grace.

39:55.325 --> 39:57.993
Why don't you tell him
that nobody likes cops anymore?

39:57.995 --> 39:59.077
Why don't you tell him that?

39:59.079 --> 40:02.164
He's got his eyes wide open.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.331
How can they be?

40:03.333 --> 40:05.417
He sees everything
through your blue lenses,

40:05.419 --> 40:06.418
you and Martin.

40:06.420 --> 40:09.337
Grace...

40:09.339 --> 40:13.008
I would never try to tell you
how to show your love

40:13.010 --> 40:15.260
to your only son.

40:17.848 --> 40:19.264
But...

40:19.266 --> 40:23.268
maybe you could try
seeing him for what he's become.

40:25.489 --> 40:28.657
Right. Got it.

40:28.659 --> 40:30.742
Maybe he even ends up
like his father,

40:30.744 --> 40:33.778
shot dead by some animal just
because he wore your uniform.

40:33.780 --> 40:37.115
All for bagpipes
and a street sign.

40:37.117 --> 40:38.783
Go to hell, Frank.

40:41.038 --> 40:44.122
(door opens, closes)

40:45.375 --> 40:47.876
(sighs)

40:47.878 --> 40:49.878
ANDERSON (over speakers):
I am the choice

40:49.880 --> 40:51.546
for a stronger New York.

40:51.548 --> 40:52.631
There he is.

40:52.633 --> 40:55.016
I will support small businesses.

40:55.018 --> 40:57.469
I will not raise taxes
on working families.

40:57.471 --> 40:59.521
Do you think we should
let him finish?

40:59.523 --> 41:02.724
And ruin all the fun?

41:02.726 --> 41:05.227
I will be a champion
of the middle class.

41:05.229 --> 41:06.528
Russ Anderson!

41:06.530 --> 41:07.946
(crowd murmuring)

41:10.734 --> 41:12.567
Can you do this after?
No. Have a seat.

41:12.569 --> 41:14.069
Russ Anderson,
you are under arrest

41:14.071 --> 41:15.904
for vehicular assault
in the first degree

41:15.906 --> 41:17.405
and driving while intoxicated.

41:17.407 --> 41:19.407
You can't charge me.
You have no evidence.

41:19.409 --> 41:20.709
Yes, we do.

41:20.711 --> 41:22.327
Your DNA was found on
the driver's side airbag.

41:22.329 --> 41:23.578
It proves you
were driving.

41:23.580 --> 41:25.247
Hands behind your back.

41:25.249 --> 41:26.298
(handcuffs clicking)

41:26.300 --> 41:28.250
Do you realize who I am?

41:28.252 --> 41:30.835
Yes, you're a
drunk and a liar.

41:30.837 --> 41:32.420
Let's go.

41:38.812 --> 41:40.729
You ever regret
being a cop?

41:40.731 --> 41:43.398
I've regretted
decisions I've made,

41:43.400 --> 41:45.817
but never my decision
to be a cop.

41:45.819 --> 41:49.271
Job's not the same
as when I started.

41:49.273 --> 41:51.773
You're not the same cop
as when you started.

41:51.775 --> 41:54.743
It's not just me
who's on trial now, Dad.

41:54.745 --> 41:56.194
It's the whole department.

41:56.196 --> 41:59.514
At least the grand jury
did the right thing.

41:59.516 --> 42:02.384
This time.

42:12.396 --> 42:15.196
What about next?

42:15.198 --> 42:18.283
If you're asking can
you take it anymore,

42:18.285 --> 42:20.735
you can.

42:20.737 --> 42:23.788
Real question...

42:24.624 --> 42:27.909
...do we have any more
to give back?
