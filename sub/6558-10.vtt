WEBVTT

00:13.097 --> 00:14.182
Huh?

00:52.094 --> 00:53.137
Shh.

01:35.805 --> 01:38.140
Hey, what's happening?

01:38.683 --> 01:40.518
Watch it!

01:41.018 --> 01:43.145
We're going to fall!

01:44.021 --> 01:46.607
I can't control it!

01:49.360 --> 01:51.362
What's going on down the road?

01:51.529 --> 01:54.490
Dig that crazy drag race!

02:10.715 --> 02:14.218
Hey, those men are in trouble!
Come on. Let's see if we can help.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.223
- Are you all right?
- Where's the little man?

02:19.557 --> 02:22.018
He flew over there somewhere.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.397
Help! Over here! Help!

02:29.233 --> 02:32.069
Help! I'm slipping!

02:34.405 --> 02:37.283
- Scooby-Doo!
- Good boy, Scooby.

02:37.450 --> 02:40.036
Great going, Scooby-Doo.
That's the way to do it.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.747
- Wow. What a catch!
- Thattaboy, Scoob.

02:42.913 --> 02:46.459
Hey, Scooby, you're some cow pony.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.879
Thanks.
I'm Max the Midget.

02:50.046 --> 02:52.423
And the big fellow
is Samson the Strongman.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.967
- Glad to meet you.
- Glad to meet you both.

02:55.176 --> 02:58.429
- That was some accident you had.
- That was no accident.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.265
Someone fixed that bike
to break in half.

03:01.432 --> 03:03.893
Who would do such a terrible thing?

03:04.060 --> 03:07.438
Never mind.
That circus we quit was jinxed.

03:07.605 --> 03:10.274
- Right, Max?
- It's jinxed all right, Sam.

03:10.441 --> 03:13.444
Let's get this bike back
together and get out of here.

03:13.611 --> 03:16.822
- Well, good luck.
- Yeah. So long, kids.

03:16.989 --> 03:19.784
If I were you, I'd get out
of this neck of the woods.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.702
And fast!

03:23.579 --> 03:26.457
What kind of a jinx
would make them leave the circus?

03:26.624 --> 03:30.127
- Search me.
- Well, let's go see.

03:45.309 --> 03:49.146
I'm sure sorry to hear
that Max and Samson took off.

03:49.313 --> 03:53.150
That's the last straw.
Now my circus won't open this year.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.027
That's too bad, Mr. Barnstorm.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.947
Tell me, what is this jinx anyway?

03:58.114 --> 04:01.492
This circus is haunted by a ghost clown.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.829
A ghost clown?

04:04.995 --> 04:07.665
A ghost clown?

04:08.666 --> 04:11.669
Yes. When the ghost clown
appears in your circus...

04:11.836 --> 04:15.840
you might as well quit.
Circus folks are superstitious.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.843
But there are no such things
as ghosts, Mr. Barnstorm.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.846
Well, there's so many
strange things going on.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.349
What sort of strange things,
Mr. Barnstorm?

04:25.516 --> 04:26.809
Weird things.

04:27.017 --> 04:30.521
Like trapeze wires
suddenly coming undone.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.190
And then the lions.

04:33.357 --> 04:36.360
They suddenly began acting
like scared pussycats.

04:36.527 --> 04:39.572
Believe me, that ghost clown is here.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.199
You kids had better
leave the grounds...

04:42.366 --> 04:44.869
- and go straight home.
- I'm all for that.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.538
Good night, Mr. Barnstorm.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.545
Ghost clowns haunting circuses
is a new one on me.

04:54.712 --> 04:57.214
Hey, where's Scooby-Doo?

05:01.886 --> 05:04.388
Watch the pretty coin of gold...

05:04.555 --> 05:06.849
and you will do what you are told.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.394
You are brave, and that's a fact.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.900
You will do the high-wire act.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.489
Scooby-Doo!
Where are you?

05:21.655 --> 05:25.367
Scooby-Doo!
Where are you?

05:25.534 --> 05:28.245
No sign of him.
Let's check in this tent.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.583
It's the big top.
Look at all the trapeze stuff.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.841
There's Scooby!
And look at what he's doing!

05:45.387 --> 05:47.765
Scooby, get down!

05:47.932 --> 05:52.436
- He acts like he's in a trance.
- He did it!

06:01.111 --> 06:03.948
Where did he learn to do that?

06:04.949 --> 06:09.328
Come on, Shaggy,
we've got to stop him.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.123
Quick! Grab this trampoline!

06:13.958 --> 06:16.210
Let's get it under Scooby.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.629
Now you stay here and try to catch him.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.549
- And I'll go up and try to help him.
- Okay.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.636
I'm coming, Scooby-Doo.

06:25.970 --> 06:28.931
The power of the ghost clown is great.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.559
It's time for that silly dog to wake.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.228
You shall not work in this circus.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.736
Huh? Where am I?

06:43.153 --> 06:46.240
Scooby, be careful!
You're on the trapeze wire.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.618
The wire?

06:49.994 --> 06:52.162
Oh, no!

06:52.788 --> 06:57.084
- Hey, Scooby-Doo!
- Wire? Yipe!

06:58.627 --> 07:00.796
Whoa!

07:01.171 --> 07:05.092
Here's an umbrella to help you balance.
Catch!

07:06.385 --> 07:08.387
Thanks!

07:08.804 --> 07:10.931
Scooby, pop the chute!

07:14.852 --> 07:17.104
Great! You got it made.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.990
Scooby-Doo!

07:49.053 --> 07:51.639
Scooby-Doo!

07:51.805 --> 07:53.474
Oh-oh.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.938
Hey, I'm falling up!

08:00.939 --> 08:03.067
He's falling up.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.908
All that goes up must come down.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.751
They're shooting at me.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.966
Whoa!

08:28.258 --> 08:31.595
Shooting at you?
I'll save you!

08:33.389 --> 08:35.516
Coming, Scooby!

08:37.059 --> 08:40.270
A clown's rubber ladder.
I should have known.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.250
Gotcha!

09:01.959 --> 09:03.877
We saved you, Scooby.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.297
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.514
Where could they be?

09:16.140 --> 09:19.017
- Not a sign of Scooby yet.
- Freddy, what's that?

09:22.604 --> 09:25.482
- Looks like the ghost clown.
- Let's see what he's up to.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.651
He's going into the costume tent.

09:27.818 --> 09:30.821
He could be hiding anywhere in here.

09:31.739 --> 09:36.827
You go left, and I'll go right.
I'd better check this giant steamer trunk.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.039
Oh!

09:41.290 --> 09:43.584
Freddy, what is it?

09:44.460 --> 09:45.669
Freddy!

09:46.044 --> 09:47.838
Where are you?

09:48.046 --> 09:51.675
You will pay attention for a time.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.053
And soon your thoughts
shall all be mine.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.348
Watch the pretty coin of gold...

09:58.515 --> 10:02.186
and you will do as you are told.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.238
I wonder if that ghost clown
is still here in the big top.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.865
Let's, like, give a look.

10:20.329 --> 10:23.957
- What's that?
- It's Daphne on a unicycle.

10:24.166 --> 10:28.212
- Huh?
- She can't even ride a bicycle.

10:34.802 --> 10:38.972
- She's in a trance, just like Scooby was.
- We got to wake her up.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.016
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

10:56.615 --> 10:59.326
She's coming back!
Now's our chance.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.328
Give me a hand, Scooby.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.123
Grab the stampede net!

11:11.505 --> 11:14.508
Hang on! Here she comes!

11:36.363 --> 11:39.867
She's heading out of the big top.
We mustn't lose her!

11:45.372 --> 11:48.542
Shaggy! Scooby!
Daphne went in the animal tent.

11:48.709 --> 11:53.881
- Hurry! Maybe we can catch her.
- Animal tent? Let's go.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.566
Look at Daphne ride along the top
of those elephants.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.401
She could get hurt.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.571
Look! Now she's coming back!

12:18.739 --> 12:21.241
- We got to wake her up!
- I'll do it!

12:40.928 --> 12:42.763
Not me! Her!

12:46.224 --> 12:48.101
Now!

12:49.770 --> 12:54.149
Ow! What? Hey! Stop it!

12:55.442 --> 12:59.613
- That woke her up!
- Hey, Daphne! You're okay now.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.616
Will you tell me what I'm doing
in this silly costume?

13:02.783 --> 13:05.786
- And all wet?
- You were in a trance.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.622
We had to wake you up.
Where's Freddy?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.624
Freddy?
We were in the costume tent.

13:10.791 --> 13:13.669
- Then all went blank.
- Huh?

13:13.961 --> 13:18.799
Costume tent. We'd better get over
there and find him, like, fast.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.973
This is really weird.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.976
I was locked in the trunk,
and you were in a trance.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.144
Don't you remember anything, Daphne?

13:31.311 --> 13:34.690
I remember something about money.
The rest is a blank.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.149
How did he do it?

13:36.316 --> 13:40.320
The only way we'll answer that
is to ask the ghost clown himself.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.323
Oh-oh.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.494
Now, here's the perfect trap.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.664
One of us gets the ghost clown
to chase him into the cage.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.667
Then our man ducks out
the door at the other end.

13:53.834 --> 13:57.671
Which is closed by releasing a rope,
and then we have him caged.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.173
And who's the bait for this trap?

14:00.340 --> 14:04.011
The fastest runner, that's who.
Scooby-Doo.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.852
Sprained ankle!

14:12.019 --> 14:15.022
That sprained-ankle act
won't work, Scooby.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.857
Anybody have a Scooby snack?

14:17.024 --> 14:20.610
I think this calls for a bigger reward,
don't you, Daphne?

14:20.819 --> 14:23.447
I sure do!
Here's a super-duper...

14:23.613 --> 14:25.699
hero sandwich!

14:29.369 --> 14:31.371
Okay, Scooby?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.707
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Hold it!

14:33.874 --> 14:38.712
You forgot I'm a track man.
I can really run, and fast!

14:39.212 --> 14:41.465
- But I'm faster.
- Why don't you both go...

14:41.631 --> 14:43.550
- and split the sandwich?
- Good idea.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.886
Okay by me.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.902
Hold it, Scooby.
That's him.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.737
That's the ghost clown.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.242
Let's surround him.
You go that way.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.411
And I'll go this way.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.585
Watch the pretty coin of gold...

15:18.752 --> 15:20.754
and you will do as you are told.

15:21.088 --> 15:24.466
You are brave, and that's a fact.

15:25.258 --> 15:29.096
So you will do the lion-tamer's act.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.780
Back up there, Simba!

15:46.947 --> 15:49.282
Roll over, Simba!

15:49.449 --> 15:51.451
Shaggy!

15:57.165 --> 16:01.711
- What's he doing?
- Ha! Now, Simba, stand!

16:01.920 --> 16:04.172
Stand, Simba!

16:08.844 --> 16:09.886
Shaggy?

16:12.973 --> 16:16.810
Very good, but now
the ghost clown strikes.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.813
Ha! Ha!

16:19.980 --> 16:21.648
Back, Simba!

16:21.815 --> 16:23.316
Back!

16:23.525 --> 16:29.030
Ha-ha! Ho-ho! Hey-hey!

16:37.330 --> 16:40.667
When I blow this whistle,
you won't be a lion-tamer.

16:40.834 --> 16:45.255
You'll be a tasty snack
for a hungry lion.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.342
- Down, Simba!
- Shaggy!

16:49.509 --> 16:51.845
Up, Simba! Up!

16:52.012 --> 16:54.848
Down! Up! Down!

16:55.765 --> 16:57.517
Shaggy!

16:57.851 --> 16:59.394
Back, Simba!

16:59.561 --> 17:01.396
Back!

17:06.985 --> 17:09.696
Shaggy! Shaggy!

17:09.988 --> 17:11.531
Give me that whistle.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.576
Quick, Shaggy! Wake up!

17:18.538 --> 17:21.124
Oh, hi, Scooby.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.710
Yipe!

17:26.046 --> 17:28.048
Here, Shaggy!

17:28.882 --> 17:32.385
- Huh? Where did he go?
- Over here.

17:32.594 --> 17:35.222
Here I am. What you waiting for?

17:41.519 --> 17:45.273
So they think they have escaped me.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.569
Man, he's after us!

17:49.736 --> 17:53.073
Back to the cage
and the hero sandwich!

17:53.573 --> 17:55.242
He's coming!

17:55.659 --> 17:57.827
Drop the door!

18:04.251 --> 18:05.752
We got him!
Way to go!

18:05.919 --> 18:07.587
Hooray!

18:07.754 --> 18:10.257
Good work, gang.
Now we'll unmask the ghost.

18:10.423 --> 18:14.970
You fools will never capture
the ghost clown!

18:16.096 --> 18:18.932
Don't tell me there are two of them.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.768
Look! The one in the cage is gone.

18:22.060 --> 18:25.105
I can't believe it.
I would have bet money we had him.

18:25.272 --> 18:29.025
Money? Hey, that's it.
A gold coin!

18:29.192 --> 18:31.528
I have an idea about this ghost, Scooby.

18:31.695 --> 18:33.280
And we're going out again.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.991
Not again!

18:46.960 --> 18:49.296
Watch the pretty coin of gold...

18:49.462 --> 18:52.632
and you both shall do as you are told.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.801
Now, Scooby!

18:56.303 --> 18:58.972
You both have fur.
You both are limp.

18:59.139 --> 19:02.142
You swing from trees
like a happy chimp.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.227
Watch the pretty coin of gold.

19:04.394 --> 19:07.480
Be chimpanzees as you are told!

19:27.250 --> 19:29.836
Look what Shaggy and Scooby
brought in on a leash.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.048
They got him!
But what's going on?

19:34.215 --> 19:38.011
Simple.
He hypnotized himself.

19:43.767 --> 19:47.354
I know that man.
He's Harry the Hypnotist.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.358
He had an act with us, but we caught
him stealing and sent him to prison.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.860
Looks like he wanted to get revenge.

19:54.027 --> 19:57.072
As a ghost clown,
he knew he could ruin your circus.

19:57.238 --> 20:00.533
He had us fooled with this balloon
copy of the ghost clown.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.869
He inflated it
with this gas cartridge.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.205
And it disappeared when he deflated it.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.040
Well, it was great work, kids.

20:07.207 --> 20:11.795
Thanks to you,
my circus will open this year after all.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.133
Shaggy and Scooby
sure were mysterious...

20:17.300 --> 20:19.719
about this big surprise
they have for us.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.722
I hope Scooby doesn't try
that high-wire act again.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.725
Ladies and gentlemen...

20:25.892 --> 20:29.729
presenting that Hercules
among strongmen.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.273
The man with muscles of steel.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.734
Samson the Super!

20:34.901 --> 20:38.238
If he can lift that, he is Samson.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.746
Yay!

20:48.748 --> 20:51.167
What an act!
It's great!

20:51.334 --> 20:54.254
What a pair of hams.
They're a riot.

21:16.192 --> 21:17.360
Huh?

21:54.689 --> 21:55.732
Shh.
