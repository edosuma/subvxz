00:08.000 --> 00:11.300
Despite your healthy teen scepticism,
Jeremy,

00:11.500 --> 00:13.700
problems that seem crushing now

00:13.900 --> 00:17.400
can actually serve to shape your life
in positive ways later on.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.700
JEREMY [OVER PHONE]:
<i>You're just saying that.</i>

00:19.800 --> 00:22.700
No. Well, I'll tell you what. Perhaps
I can convince you with a story.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.100
I recall a young man who suffered
from involuntary bed-wetting

00:27.500 --> 00:29.900
until he was 12 years old.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.299
Or was it 13?

00:32.600 --> 00:36.100
Boy, you'd think I'd remember.
I slept in the lower bunk.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.200
The point is,
it was very difficult for him,

00:39.600 --> 00:43.300
what with, uh, the alarms
and the bladder-stretching exercises,

00:43.600 --> 00:46.900
and the incessant teasing he suffered
once his schoolmates found out.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.500
JEREMY:
<i>How'd they find out?</i>

00:48.600 --> 00:53.300
Well, the point I'm trying to make here
is that this man today

00:53.600 --> 00:56.600
is a prominent and respected
psychiatrist.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.400
And, you see, his afflictions
served to make him stronger,

01:00.600 --> 01:04.500
more empathic,
and extremely hygienic.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.500
- So hang in there, Jeremy.
JEREMY: <i>Okay.</i>

01:07.800 --> 01:09.500
- <i>Thanks, Dr. Crane.</i>
- Thank you.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.500
And thank you, listeners.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.700
This is Dr. Frasier Crane saying
good day and good mental health.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.600
That was kind of brave
to admit you were a bed-wetter.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.600
Oh, Roz, pay attention.
That was Niles, not me.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.900
Well, you know, I've gotta run.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.100
I'm putting the finishing touches on
my speech for the Boston conference.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.200
- Did you come up with a title?
- Yes. Niles will be introducing me on:

01:34.500 --> 01:36.100
"Notes for a Critical Approach
to Radio

01:36.400 --> 01:40.500
as Mediating Gateway to the Process
of Psychological Demystification."

01:41.600 --> 01:43.000
Good speech. What's the title?

01:43.200 --> 01:44.400
[FRASIER CHUCKLES]

01:44.600 --> 01:47.200
Well, it promises to be
a fun family weekend for all, actually.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
Oh.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.000
So, what have you got planned?

01:50.200 --> 01:53.000
Actually, my sorority sisters
are coming in for a visit.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.100
I suppose you'll be sharing
the secret handshake,

01:55.400 --> 01:56.800
doing skits, that sort of thing.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.800
Yeah, right.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.100
Only problem is, it's just
my apartment is just too small

02:03.300 --> 02:06.100
for everyone to stay, and...
Hey, your place will be empty.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.400
[CHUCKLES]

02:07.700 --> 02:10.100
- Say no more, Roz. No.
- Why not?

02:10.400 --> 02:13.000
I'm sorry, Roz. It's just the idea
of strangers in my apartment.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.400
I couldn't sleep.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.200
- Sorry I asked.
- No apology necessary.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.700
Ooh. Oh, Roz,
that reminds me, actually.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.100
Since you're gonna be
walking Eddie for Dad anyway,

02:21.300 --> 02:23.500
I wrote a list of things
you could do for me as well.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.900
"Pick up the mail and newspapers.
Water the ficus. Fluff your pillows"?

02:27.200 --> 02:28.400
Yes. Thank you. Oh,

02:28.600 --> 02:31.100
and please don't forget
to mist my bedroom with rose water.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.400
It likes it best at dusk.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.900
FRASIER:
Oh, I love returning to Boston.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.000
There's just something in the air.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.300
Perhaps the toxic gas spewing
from your gigantic mouth.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.300
Oh, please, would you just let it go?
I didn't mention your name.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.800
No, you just said
it was someone

02:49.100 --> 02:51.300
with whom you shared a bunk bed
who is now a psychiatrist.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.500
I'd say that narrows the field
down to, hmm, me.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.900
But only to someone who knows
that you're my brother.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.800
- And who would that be?
- My patients.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.100
- The guys at work.
- One of the flight attendants.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.300
Oh, so that's why
she looked at me that way

03:04.400 --> 03:05.900
when I told her I spilled my drink.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.400
Would you come on? I wanna
see my bag come down the chute.

03:08.700 --> 03:09.800
FRASIER:
All right, Dad.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.200
You can forget about
my introducing your talk.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.300
Oh, Niles, you can't be serious.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.800
I wouldn't even be here
if Daphne didn't wanna see Boston.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.700
Yes, I do. So you two make up,

03:18.900 --> 03:21.200
and let's go and get
one of those famous Boston lobsters.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.600
No, it's Maine that's famous
for lobsters, sweetheart.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.100
Boston's famous for beans.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.500
- Beans?
NILES: Mm-hm.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.800
What kind of a city
brags about bloody beans?

03:30.100 --> 03:31.900
MAN:
Yeah, that's right.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.200
Yeah, your common pumpkin
was once, uh, 600 times the size

03:35.400 --> 03:38.400
of the present-day variety,
thereby allowing the entire fiefdom

03:38.800 --> 03:43.400
to feast the whole winter
on the, uh, meat of a single seed.

- Nice to meet a fellow civil servant.

- You're one of the brethren, are you?
- I was a cop for 30 years.

Oh, yeah. Couldn't pass
the mail-carrier's exam, huh?

You know what,

for a, uh, Red Sox reunion tonight.

Uh, we're gonna be
at the, uh, Somerville Town Crier.

Why did you do that?
This is our one free night.

to get dinner reservations at L'Espalier.

could live in your Speedos.

Ah, now, don't you worry
about that, missy.

I'm gonna buy myself an airboat.

Yeah, give tours of the Everglades,
maybe wrestle a few crocodiles.

- That would be alligators.
- Eh, common mistake there, sparky.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.500
See, when a crocodile
raises its head,

08:33.700 --> 08:38.000
its nostrils get pinched shut tight,
thereby cutting off its oxygen supply.

Yeah, a baby could wrestle one.

of Frasier?

10:14.200 --> 10:17.100
- Say indubitably.
- Must I?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.500
- It's uncanny.
- Yeah.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.800
Hey, remember that time you guys
took Frasier on a snipe hunt?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.900
NORM: Yeah.
- What's a snipe hunt?

10:26.200 --> 10:29.200
That's when you take some
unsuspecting dope out to bag snipe,

10:29.400 --> 10:32.500
which don't exist,
and then you ditch him in the woods.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.600
That must've been
completely humiliating.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.900
Yeah, well, that's the point.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.100
Do you have any more
of these stories?

10:40.300 --> 10:42.300
- Only about a million.
NILES: Oh.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.100
I don't have time for a million.
Just tell me the hundred worst.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.000
Okay, well, when Frasier first started
coming to Cheers,

10:48.200 --> 10:49.700
he was really kind of a boob.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.500
Yeah, a boob.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.900
Sorry.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.800
CLIFF:
Everybody, attention. Uh...

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Mr. Twitchell's
got something to say, huh?

11:01.300 --> 11:04.700
I'd like to propose a toast
to Cliff Clavin.

11:05.100 --> 11:08.200
We were often adversaries,
but he was a postman.

11:08.500 --> 11:12.200
And I'll say this about him,
he never developed a stoop.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.600
[CLIFF CHUCKLES]

11:13.800 --> 11:16.500
Mostly because he threw
the big catalogues into the river.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.200
[ALL LAUGH]

11:19.100 --> 11:23.000
And even though he didn't
strictly abide by the rules,

11:23.200 --> 11:25.700
especially 367-B, Section 17...

11:26.000 --> 11:27.700
[ALL LAUGHING]

11:30.700 --> 11:33.400
Well, anyway, um,
when all is said and done,

11:33.800 --> 11:38.100
you have to ask, what will the mail be
without Cliff Clavin?

11:38.500 --> 11:40.600
ALL:
On time!

11:42.100 --> 11:43.600
CLIFF:
Twitchell, thank you very much.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.800
I just wanna thank you, Cliff,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.500
for all the great times
we had at Cheers.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.800
Well, you were always
there for me, Al.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.300
I'm Phil.
Al's been dead for 14 years,

11:53.600 --> 11:56.100
you dumb son of a bitch.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.100
Well, you know, I hadn't planned
on, uh, making a speech,

12:04.400 --> 12:06.700
so my remarks
will have to be extemporaneous.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.900
I hope that means dirty.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.000
Smart money's on long.

12:11.500 --> 12:15.300
It was about ten years ago
when I, too, left Boston.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.400
But the kind wishes and outpouring
of emotion from my friends

12:18.700 --> 12:20.500
remain fresh in my mind.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.500
I still remember Sam
throwing me a lavish party

12:23.800 --> 12:25.600
and dubbing me
the Einstein of Cheers,

12:25.800 --> 12:30.200
against my modest protest
that I was merely the Niels Bohr.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.100
[CHUCKLES]

12:32.400 --> 12:34.500
You still are.

12:34.900 --> 12:37.900
Carla, thank you. Ha.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.500
And then, of course,
Norm begging me to stay,

12:40.800 --> 12:42.200
and that comical moment

12:42.500 --> 12:46.500
when Woody threw his arms
around my legs and began to cry. I...

12:46.800 --> 12:52.100
Well... And now another of us
is leaving this wonderful town.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.000
Good luck, Cliff.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.900
ALL:
Hear, hear.

12:56.100 --> 12:59.300
Great.
I was gonna say "good luck, Cliff."

13:03.800 --> 13:06.100
FRASIER: Please hold our table.
We'll be there in a half hour.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.600
[FOOTSTEPS]

13:09.100 --> 13:11.500
Cliff, are you all right?

13:11.700 --> 13:13.900
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I just, uh...

13:14.200 --> 13:17.200
Whew-hoo, gotta take a break
from all that partying. Heh, heh.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.000
Hmm...

13:19.300 --> 13:21.500
All right, you pried it out of me.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.700
It's my so-called friends.
They don't care about me.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.300
Oh, sure they do.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.400
No, your toast in there
brought home the ugly truth.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.500
You know, when you left,
everybody asked you to stay.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.700
I mean, I told these bullocks
six months ago I was retiring,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.300
and not one single one of them
said anything like, uh:

13:38.600 --> 13:40.900
"Yeah, I'm sure gonna miss you there,
uh, Big Shooter."

13:41.100 --> 13:43.600
Or, "Gee, I wish you could
stick around, Big Shooter."

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Big Shooter?

13:45.300 --> 13:47.900
Yeah, it's a nickname
I once gave myself.

13:50.700 --> 13:53.100
Well, Cliff, you know,
it's entirely possible

13:53.400 --> 13:58.100
that your friends are suffering
from a kind of, uh, separation anxiety.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.600
They may find it difficult
to admit to themselves

14:00.900 --> 14:03.200
that you are actually leaving.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.900
You know, I could have
a little talk with them if you'd like.

14:07.200 --> 14:10.700
Huh. Well, what kind of hollow victory
would that be?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.500
If I walk around the block,
would that give you time?

14:14.800 --> 14:15.800
Sure.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.000
Uh, everybody, uh, listen up.

14:20.100 --> 14:23.600
Um, Cliff is going through
a kind of a crisis about leaving.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.500
No, no, he's not. No crisis.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.700
It would go a long way
toward helping him

14:29.000 --> 14:32.300
if you could just let him know
how much you're gonna miss him.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.900
Tell him, you know,
how sad you are that he's leaving.

14:35.300 --> 14:36.700
NORM:
I don't know, Fras.

14:36.900 --> 14:39.900
Look, I'm his best friend,
but I am no good at the mushy stuff.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.800
Surely you can come up
with a few words.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.100
Yeah, but what if he cries?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.900
You know,
what if he tries to hug me?

14:46.700 --> 14:49.000
What are people gonna think,
two guys hugging? I, uh...

14:49.600 --> 14:51.400
Hey, you're gonna kiss him
with tongue

14:51.700 --> 14:54.400
if that's what it takes
to get rid of him.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.900
Shh, okay, here he is.
Everyone pretend you like him.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.900
- Carla, we do like him.
- Yeah, like that.

my role model.

Really? You...? You mean that, Paul?

15:15.700 --> 15:19.000
I sure do.
Especially when it comes to the ladies.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.900

Hear, hear.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.300
I haven't known you
for very long, Cliff,

15:33.600 --> 15:36.400
but I've learned so much from you.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.000
I never knew
that the Indians of the rainforest

15:39.200 --> 15:44.200
used to stretch out pig intestines
and use it as a primitive telephone.

15:44.500 --> 15:48.600
Or that Winston Churchill
invented the modern English muffin.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.000
You're a fascinating man.

15:52.500 --> 15:56.500
- Good luck.
CLIFF: Oh. Ah, thank you, Daphne.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.900
He's smooth.

16:03.700 --> 16:06.100
Congratulations, Cliff.
Stop that. Stop it.

Cliffie, we've been best friends
for a long, long time.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.200
We've done a lot of stuff together.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.400
Most of it dumb,
the rest of it boring.

16:23.700 --> 16:27.300
But it's like we have this connection,
you know?

16:27.700 --> 16:29.900
I mean, somehow we know
when we wanna be dumb

16:30.200 --> 16:32.200
and when we wanna be boring.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.000
I don't know
what I'm gonna do without you.

have a few words to say?

I sure do.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.000
I know that things
haven't always been that great

17:17.200 --> 17:18.400
between us over the years,

17:18.700 --> 17:22.099
but, well, being here tonight
makes me think

17:22.400 --> 17:25.800
about the effect that you've had
on my life.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.400
I'd like to say that I'll miss you...

17:35.500 --> 17:40.200

like your rotten devilled eggs!

about nothing!

- Back off! I'm toasting!

18:08.400 --> 18:10.700
The 20 years I have known you
would've been less painful

18:11.000 --> 18:14.500
if I was covered with open sores
and thrown into a pit

18:14.800 --> 18:16.900
with a bunch of diseased rats!

18:18.700 --> 18:20.300

as I used to be,

18:22.700 --> 18:26.000

When I heard Paul and Norm there
saying all those nice things about me,

18:56.100 --> 18:58.000
I actually started thinking, uh:

18:58.300 --> 19:01.600
"Maybe I shouldn't go to Florida
and leave all my friends."

19:02.000 --> 19:03.800
You know,
"Am I doing the right thing?"

19:04.900 --> 19:10.100
But when I heard you speak those
words, Carla, that's when I decided.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.900
I am gonna stay.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.700
- What?
- That's right, you little dickens.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.700
You only joke about somebody like that
when you really care for them.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.800
I wasn't joking. I really hate you.
