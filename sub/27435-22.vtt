RESSLER: But why?
And why wait, then?

33:06.450 --> 33:08.645
Why not shoot
during the debate
when he's not moving?

33:08.680 --> 33:10.477
NEWSCASTER: (ON TV)
Meanwhile the outpouring
of sympathy

33:10.520 --> 33:12.340
from around
the world continues

33:12.390 --> 33:14.153
for the President
and his injured wife.

33:15.690 --> 33:19.478
You think he arranged all this
to boost his poll numbers?

33:19.530 --> 33:21.589
RESSLER: A crack shot
misses an easy target?

33:21.630 --> 33:23.655
It's the only explanation
that makes sense.

33:25.430 --> 33:27.295
Except for
the real explanation.

33:27.330 --> 33:28.661
And what's that?

33:30.000 --> 33:31.206
He didn't miss.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.469
In no world
is this okay.

33:40.510 --> 33:43.445
We'll keep it brief.
Two minutes.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.789
I told them
we had information
on the assassination

33:45.820 --> 33:48.186
and that_ it was a matter
of national security,

33:48.220 --> 33:50.313
and they gave me
two minutes!

33:51.730 --> 33:53.220
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

34:06.310 --> 34:08.437
I agreed to talk to you,
but this...

34:08.480 --> 34:10.505
My God.
What's he doing here?

34:10.540 --> 34:12.804
REDDINGTON: Mrs. Diaz,
for the sake of brevity,

34:12.850 --> 34:15.341
please allow me to get
right to the point.

34:15.380 --> 34:19.544
I understand you've been
harboring a powerful secret.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.353
I need to know
what that secret is.

34:21.390 --> 34:24.848
What is this?
Why is he here?

34:24.890 --> 34:26.619
REDDINGTON:
Because of your husband.

34:26.660 --> 34:30.027
You and I both know
that about four years ago,

34:30.060 --> 34:32.494
he accepted hundreds
of millions of dollars

34:32.530 --> 34:35.738
from a Russian oligarch
named Constantine Rostov.

34:36.640 --> 34:39.234
I blackmailed him
about it at the time,

34:39.270 --> 34:42.239
but there's more to the story,
isn't there, Mrs. Diaz?

34:42.280 --> 34:44.703
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

34:45.410 --> 34:47.344
The assassination attempt.

34:48.180 --> 34:49.841
It wasn't aimed
at the President.

34:50.720 --> 34:53.644
It was orchestrated
by the President

34:53.690 --> 34:55.157
to kill you.

34:55.190 --> 34:59.354
A plot by a desperate man
trying to get rid of his wife,

34:59.390 --> 35:02.689
while disguising her murder
in the mess of what appeared

35:02.730 --> 35:05.221
to be a botched
assassmation.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.226
What would
make you think...

35:07.270 --> 35:08.589
Why?

35:11.840 --> 35:14.638
That can't be.
Mrs. Diaz.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.035
Why does your husband
want you dead?

35:23.080 --> 35:24.581
It's all right, Miriam.

35:29.090 --> 35:31.320
Four months
before the primaries,

35:31.360 --> 35:33.624
we were at my parents' place
at Indian Lake.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.054
We'd been out.
We'd been drinking.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.437
There was a woman.
And her son.

35:45.110 --> 35:48.602
Robert, he'd had
so much to drink,
he thought he hit a deer.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.998
We talked about
going to the police.

35:53.910 --> 35:54.877
We didn't.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.613
Robert said he knew a man,
a fixer.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.015
The Russian money wasn't used
to buy the election.

36:04.060 --> 36:06.426
It was used to buy
your husband's reputation.

36:12.370 --> 36:13.621
...fine.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.534
I thought I was.

36:16.700 --> 36:19.464
But I couldn't sleep.
I... I couldn't eat.

36:20.940 --> 36:22.168
I wanted...

36:23.010 --> 36:24.307
What did you want?

36:25.980 --> 36:27.868
I wanted him
to tell the truth.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.419
To go public.

36:30.450 --> 36:32.179
I didn't care what it meant.

36:32.220 --> 36:34.381
I wanted us to do
the right thing.

36:37.590 --> 36:38.989
But he refused.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.821
So I put together documents.

36:41.860 --> 36:43.350
From the fixer.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.628
I made recordings.

36:44.670 --> 36:45.989
Proof.

36:53.740 --> 36:54.729
That bullet.

36:56.910 --> 36:59.174
(VOICE BREAKING)
You really think
it was intended for me?

37:00.250 --> 37:03.174
This is not
some horrible mistake?

37:05.420 --> 37:08.014
Horrible, yes.

37:11.060 --> 37:13.528
But this was
not a mistake,
Mrs. Diaz.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.268
NEWSCASTER: (ON TV)
The President will announce
his resignation

37:21.300 --> 37:22.892
in a prime-time address
to the nation.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.168
MALE REPORTER:
The attempt on the First Lady

37:24.200 --> 37:26.566
was allegedly orchestrated
by the President.

FEMALE REPORTER 1:
A stunning fall from grace...

37:28.610 --> 37:30.805

...as an attempt
on the First Lady's life...

FEMALE REPORTER 3:
...prime-time address...

COOPER:
Sir, did you hear
what I said?

37:36.520 --> 37:37.544
Mr. President?

37:37.580 --> 37:39.639
PRESIDENT DIAZ:
Yes, I heard you.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.908
Upon my resignation,
the Bureau will open

37:41.960 --> 37:43.609
a criminal investigation.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.557
Reddington did this.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.467
No, sir.
You did this to yourself.

37:54.570 --> 37:57.539
How does a wanted fugitive
bring down a President?

37:59.270 --> 38:00.567
(INHALES DEEPLY)
With pleasure.

38:00.610 --> 38:03.534
* You're gone now for so long

38:03.580 --> 38:05.571
* You grown a child

38:05.610 --> 38:08.443
Ah, I feel anxious.
I don't know why.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.777
REDDINGTON:
It's a new beginning.

38:09.820 --> 38:11.447
Anxious isn't really
the right word.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.708
It's more like...
Heightened.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.957
Like, I could feel
every breath.

38:15.990 --> 38:17.719
I'm not used to that.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.421
You're doing the right thing,
Elizabeth.

38:19.460 --> 38:23.556
Well, it's only because
I finally know.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.398
I know who you are.
I know that you care.

38:26.430 --> 38:29.069
I know that I'm safe.
I know that my mother cared.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.738
She'd be proud of you.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.698
Ooh! Welcome home, Agnes.

Oh, I've missed you.

38:40.610 --> 38:41.645
Kat, hi.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.671
Scottie wanted me to tell you
she'll bring over

38:43.720 --> 38:45.187

* Everything we do is a mess

Well, we'd better get going.
May we walk you out?

39:00.830 --> 39:03.162
* But, oh, honey

39:04.040 --> 39:05.928
You're not gonna
stay for dinner?

39:05.970 --> 39:08.939
And intrude on your
mother-daughter reunion?

39:08.980 --> 39:11.130
I don't think so.

39:11.180 --> 39:12.602
And we need
to be someplace.

If you're not sure...
I'm sure.
