01:06.910 --> 01:08.140
Why shouldn't I be happy?

It's a beautiful day,
my homework is done

01:10.650 --> 01:12.790
I got my mojo working,
and we're going on a field trip

Hey, it's not in here.

01:25.560 --> 01:26.860
You stole it!

01:26.930 --> 01:29.530
No one wants
your stupid police badge, Bart.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.210
Hey, look what I got--

01:31.270 --> 01:33.210
a genuine official police badge.

01:33.270 --> 01:34.240
Calling all cars.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.310
Come out with your hands up.

01:36.380 --> 01:38.210
Hey, that's
my badge, Homer.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.310
That's right-- it's time
for our field trip

02:46.380 --> 02:48.350
to the Chocolate Factory.

02:48.410 --> 02:50.940

03:01.460 --> 03:03.600
Lisa:
I'm going to eat
eight pieces of chocolate.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.390
I'm gonna eat chocolate

03:05.460 --> 03:06.660
( <i>chuckling )</i>

03:06.730 --> 03:07.900
Don't worry, Bart.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.570
We'll find something
fun for you to do.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.670
Ah, here we are.
Here's a whole box
of unsealed envelopes

03:12.740 --> 03:14.010
for the P.T.A.

03:14.070 --> 03:15.900
You're making me lick envelopes?

03:15.970 --> 03:17.740
Oh, licking envelopes
can be fun.

03:17.810 --> 03:19.210
All you have to do is
make a game of it.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.880
What kind of game?

03:20.950 --> 03:23.250
Well, for example, you can see
how many you can lick in an
hour.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.150
Then try to break
that record.

03:25.220 --> 03:27.190
Sounds like a pretty crappy
game to me.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.080
Yes, well, get started.

03:31.160 --> 03:35.200

03:39.630 --> 03:42.440
I think this is something
Bart would really have
enjoyed,

03:42.500 --> 03:44.710
but it's the only way
he'll learn.

03:57.050 --> 03:59.290
and <i>The Wackiest Covered Wagon
in the West.</i>

03:59.350 --> 04:02.590
The history of chocolate
starts with the ancient Aztecs.

04:02.650 --> 04:04.150
In those days

04:04.220 --> 04:06.050
instead of being wrapped
in a hygienic package,

04:06.120 --> 04:07.050
chocolate was wrapped

04:07.130 --> 04:08.600
in a tobacco leaf.

04:08.660 --> 04:10.260
Instead of being pure chocolate

04:10.330 --> 04:11.670
like we have today

04:11.730 --> 04:13.630
it was mixed
with shredded tobacco

04:13.700 --> 04:15.240
and they didn't eat it--

04:15.300 --> 04:16.300
they smoked it.

But don't you tell your teacher

10:24.600 --> 10:26.460
to feed
your starving family?

10:26.540 --> 10:27.740
No.

10:27.810 --> 10:29.610
Well suppose you got
a large starving family

10:29.670 --> 10:32.600
is it wrong to steal
a truckload of bread
to feed them?

10:32.680 --> 10:33.780
Uh-uh.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.420
And what if your family
don't like bread?

10:36.480 --> 10:37.620
They like... cigarettes.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.140
I guess that's okay.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.560
Now, what if instead
of giving them away

10:41.620 --> 10:43.160
you sold them
at a price

10:43.220 --> 10:45.530
that was practically
giving them away?

10:45.590 --> 10:47.660
<i>Would that be
a crime, Bart?</i>

10:47.730 --> 10:49.100
Hell no.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.530
Enjoy your gift.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.130
Su-perb.

11:01.270 --> 11:03.570
♪ That strips

11:03.640 --> 11:05.750
♪ It's witchcraft. ♪

11:05.810 --> 11:07.920

of milk, ma.

11:07.980 --> 11:08.550
( <i>grumbling )</i>

11:09.980 --> 11:12.250
I know it's good for a boy to
have a part-time job

11:12.320 --> 11:13.690
but I'm not sure

11:13.750 --> 11:15.620
about the people
Bart's working for.

11:15.690 --> 11:16.890
I think they're criminals.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.730
A job's a job.

11:18.790 --> 11:22.000
I mean, take me.
If my plant pollutes the water
and poisons the town

11:22.060 --> 11:25.170
by your logic,
that would make me a criminal.

11:25.230 --> 11:27.100
Bart's been acting
very strangely

11:27.170 --> 11:29.170
and that pizza delivery truck

11:29.230 --> 11:32.260
has been parked
across the street for two weeks.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.940
How long does it take
to deliver a pizza?

11:35.010 --> 11:36.140
Looks like our cover's blown.

11:36.210 --> 11:37.080
Let's roll.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.170
See? It was all
your imagination.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.920
Homer, I want you to go
down to that club

11:43.980 --> 11:45.290
and talk to them.

11:45.350 --> 11:47.720
See what kind
of people they are.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.720
Please, Homie.

11:49.790 --> 11:51.390
Oh, all right.

11:53.530 --> 11:55.460
Hmm.

11:55.530 --> 11:57.060
( <i>Homer chuckling )</i>

11:57.130 --> 11:58.770
Read 'em and weep, boys.

11:58.830 --> 12:00.100
Another pair of sixes.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.540
Beats me.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.870
I was bluffing.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.500
You win again,
Homer.

12:04.570 --> 12:05.770
( <i>Homer chuckling )</i>

12:05.840 --> 12:07.440
I am thrilled you've decided
to let your boy

12:07.510 --> 12:09.080
continue to work here.

12:09.140 --> 12:11.180
Y'know, if you
need a hat-check girl,
I've got a daughter.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.540
Homer, you're
a hell of a father.

12:14.810 --> 12:17.340
Homer! What did
you find out?

12:17.420 --> 12:19.750
Marge, the only thing
going on down there

12:19.820 --> 12:20.960
was a lot of
male bonding.

12:21.020 --> 12:23.020
More stink lines, boys.

12:23.090 --> 12:23.920
( <i>gasping )</i>

12:23.990 --> 12:25.030
Hmm?

12:25.090 --> 12:26.890
What's this?
What are you boys doing?

12:26.960 --> 12:28.700
( <i>yawns loudly )</i>

12:28.760 --> 12:30.830
You didn't see nothing.
Now, beat it.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.610
So, Fat Tony,
you invite

12:39.670 --> 12:41.880
me and my associates
to your club

12:41.940 --> 12:43.240
with the promise

12:43.310 --> 12:45.950
of the finest Manhattans
in all of Springfield.

12:46.010 --> 12:47.980
Now you say your Bartender
isn't here?

12:48.050 --> 12:49.920
I don't know
what happened.
He's never late.

12:49.980 --> 12:51.590
Louie, make up
some Manhattans.

12:51.650 --> 12:53.250
But I only know how to make
wine spritzers.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.050
Now!

12:59.220 --> 13:00.990
( <i>slurping )</i>

13:01.060 --> 13:06.130
What have I done to deserve
this flat, flavorless Manhattan?

13:11.540 --> 13:12.640
Mmmmm...

13:14.470 --> 13:15.930
Come on, boys.

13:17.580 --> 13:18.950
The kiss of death.

13:19.010 --> 13:20.350
That's all I need.

13:21.810 --> 13:24.110

...Lousy Skinner.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.220
<i>You are late for work.</i>

13:28.290 --> 13:30.320
Of course
I'm late for work!

13:30.390 --> 13:33.190
How can I be on time
when Principal Skinner
keeps me after school?

13:33.260 --> 13:34.760
This guy Skinner is
causing you trouble?

13:34.830 --> 13:36.330
He sure is, <i>Patron.</i>

13:36.390 --> 13:38.390
Hmm. Perhaps we should go

13:38.460 --> 13:40.720
to meet and greet
this individual.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.000
Come on, boys.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.580
Some large men
to see you, Sir.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.780
I don't have an appointment
with any large men.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.970
You Skinner?

13:54.050 --> 13:56.520
I'm Principal Skinner, yes.

13:56.580 --> 13:59.290
And how, may I ask,
did you get past
the hall monitors?

14:02.750 --> 14:04.450
( <i>snickering )</i>

14:04.520 --> 14:08.420
Children, I don't know
how to break this to you

14:08.490 --> 14:10.650
but Principal Skinner is...

14:10.730 --> 14:12.330
missing.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.140
Hm-mmm.

14:28.210 --> 14:31.310
I thought I found him,
but it was only a cat.

14:36.890 --> 14:39.290
Chief Wiggum?
Chief Wiggum?

14:39.360 --> 14:40.830
Please, I can assure you

14:40.890 --> 14:44.430
we'll be using the most advanced
scientific techniques

14:44.500 --> 14:45.930
in the field of...

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000

14:50.170 --> 14:52.110
I see wedding bells

14:52.170 --> 14:54.410
for Vanna White
and Teddy Kennedy.

14:54.470 --> 14:57.600
Please, Princess  Opal,
if we could just stick
to Principal Skinner.

14:57.680 --> 15:01.050
Chief Wiggum, I am merely
a conduit for the spirits.

15:01.110 --> 15:03.410
( gasps ) Willie Nelson
will astound his fans

15:03.480 --> 15:05.490
by swimming
the English Channel.

15:05.550 --> 15:06.620
Really? Willie Nelson?

15:10.720 --> 15:12.860
He loved fire drills.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.290
Will you get a hold
of yourself, lass

15:15.360 --> 15:16.530
for the wee bairns.

15:16.590 --> 15:18.260
Hey! Look at me!

15:18.330 --> 15:19.500
I'm Skinner's body.

15:19.560 --> 15:20.920
That is not funny, Louis.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.640
I heard Skinner's buried
under his parking spot.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.140
I heard he was ground
into hamburger and
served to us at lunch.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.200
I heard Bart
had Skinner killed
by gangsters.

15:28.270 --> 15:29.400
That's not true.
It's just a rumor.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.400
You're engaged in speculation.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.350
I know the law.

You can't prove anything.

You're eight hours
early for work.

16:50.920 --> 16:51.930
I like that.

16:51.990 --> 16:53.660
Did you kill my Principal?

16:55.560 --> 16:57.100
No. My Principal!

16:57.160 --> 16:58.430
That Skinner guy?

16:58.500 --> 17:00.230
No, we didn't kill him.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.000
Nobody move!
You're all under arrest

17:02.070 --> 17:04.440
for the murder
of Seymour Skinner.

What's a murder?

17:05.369 --> 17:07.310
Don't play dumb with me.

17:07.369 --> 17:08.510
Cuff them, boys.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.040
Oh, Bart.

17:13.109 --> 17:15.780
Why couldn't you
have gotten a paper route

17:15.849 --> 17:16.880
like other boys?

17:16.950 --> 17:18.720
Wait till I get you home, boy.

17:18.780 --> 17:19.940
What's that guy
doing here?

17:20.020 --> 17:21.460
Lionel Hats,

I'll be defending you

17:25.190 --> 17:27.130
Wow. Even if I lose
I'll be famous.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.570
That Simpson boy
is looking at 180 years.

17:33.630 --> 17:37.810
Thank God we live in a country
so hysterical over crime

17:37.870 --> 17:40.340
that a ten-year old
child can be tried
as an adult.

17:40.410 --> 17:42.710
I didn't order
this Skinner guy killed.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.870
But aren't you the
head of this gang?

17:44.940 --> 17:46.700
No. I just stop by the club
occasionally

17:46.780 --> 17:49.050
to read the complimentary
newspaper.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.410
Then who is the kingpin,
the <i>Capo di Tutti Capi?</i>

17:52.480 --> 17:53.610
That's the guy.

17:53.690 --> 17:55.290
Hey!

17:55.350 --> 17:57.850
Forgive me, Don Bartholomew.

17:57.920 --> 18:01.350
We tried to stop the kid,
but he wouldn't quit.
It was like he went crazy.

18:01.430 --> 18:04.330
Prostitution, loan sharking,
numbers...

18:04.400 --> 18:07.870
the kid liked to wet his beak
in everything.

18:07.930 --> 18:10.330
Mr. Simpson, you've been the
boy's father for ten years.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.170
Do you really think
he could be the leader

18:13.240 --> 18:15.440

criminal syndicate?

18:15.510 --> 18:16.980
Well, not the leader...

I mean...

18:18.380 --> 18:20.550
Oh, it's true, it's true!

All the pieces fit.

from your
fellow gangsters,
your father

18:31.190 --> 18:33.060

I suppose you're all wondering
where I've been.

18:44.970 --> 18:46.770
It all started a week ago.

18:46.840 --> 18:47.980
I was at my desk

18:48.040 --> 18:50.240
revising and updating
the school dress codes

18:50.310 --> 18:52.580
<i>when I was suddenly confronted
by a gang of toughs</i>

18:52.640 --> 18:55.440
<i>acting on behalf
of one Bart Simpson...</i>

18:55.510 --> 18:56.840
<i>or so they said.</i>

18:56.910 --> 18:58.880
We really think there's
promise in the boy.

18:58.950 --> 19:02.190
- Get out!
- Okay, okay.
You don't have to yell.

19:02.250 --> 19:03.950
<i>To get my mind
off that ugly confrontation</i>

19:04.020 --> 19:07.030
<i>I went home and began bundling
my old newspapers.</i>

19:07.090 --> 19:08.500
<i>But suddenly the pile fell.</i>

19:08.560 --> 19:09.930
<i>I was trapped.</i>

19:09.990 --> 19:13.460
<i>Let this be a lesson
to recycle frequently.</i>

19:13.530 --> 19:16.840
<i>For the next week
I stayed alive by eating my
mother's delicious preserves</i>

19:16.900 --> 19:18.740
<i>and maintained my sanity</i>

19:18.800 --> 19:20.830
<i>by dribbling
a nearby basketball
with my one free hand.</i>

19:20.910 --> 19:23.410
I made a game of it.
Seeing how many times

19:23.470 --> 19:26.700
I could bounce the ball
in a day, then trying
to break that record.

19:26.780 --> 19:29.620
<i>Occasionally, the police
arrived to search my home.</i>

19:29.680 --> 19:31.050
Find anything
this time, boys?

No sign of him,
Chief.

19:31.850 --> 19:33.320
Princess Opal?

19:33.380 --> 19:35.650
I see nothing here.
But I'm afraid it's splitsville

19:35.720 --> 19:37.460
for Delta Burke
and Major Dad.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.290
But they seemed so happy.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.500
<i>I shouted until I was hoarse,
but they couldn't hear me.</i>

19:42.560 --> 19:44.000
I'm in here!

19:44.060 --> 19:45.400
Wiggum:
Well, let's go.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.490
Okay, Chief.

19:47.570 --> 19:49.700
<i>Finally, I realized
if I was ever going
to get out of there</i>

19:49.770 --> 19:51.370
<i>I would have to do it myself.</i>

19:51.440 --> 19:53.110
<i>I formed a crude rocket</i>

19:53.170 --> 19:54.470
<i>from a discarded
cigar tube.</i>

19:54.540 --> 19:56.710
<i>And remembering an experiment
from my days</i>

19:56.770 --> 19:58.400
<i>as a science teacher</i>

19:58.480 --> 20:00.310
<i>I concocted a fuel</i>

20:00.380 --> 20:02.280
<i>from baking soda
and the juice of discarded
lemon wedges..</i>

20:02.350 --> 20:05.850
<i>The rocket took off with a
mighty blast of carbon dioxide</i>

20:05.920 --> 20:07.790

20:09.820 --> 20:12.530

20:12.590 --> 20:15.060

20:15.130 --> 20:16.960
And that's my courageous story.

20:19.230 --> 20:22.870
Your Honor,
the prosecution moves that
Principal Skinner's testimony

20:22.930 --> 20:23.760
be stricken
from the record.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.940
Denied. Case dismissed.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.260
Your honor...

20:27.340 --> 20:29.480
Uh, do I still get paid?

20:31.280 --> 20:33.280
Hey Bart, I hope there are
no hard feelings.

20:33.340 --> 20:34.270
Get bent.

20:34.350 --> 20:35.580
I deserve that.

20:35.650 --> 20:38.350
Look, I know we let
you down, but me and the boys

20:38.420 --> 20:40.920
we still think
you've got a big future

20:40.990 --> 20:43.020
in racketeering
<i>and extortion.</i>

20:43.090 --> 20:45.460
Sorry Fat Tony.
I used to think
your gang was cool

20:45.520 --> 20:46.820
but now I learned

20:46.890 --> 20:48.700
that crime doesn't pay.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.400
Yeah, you're right.

Bart, I'm scared.
Let's get out of here.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.260
Shut up.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.360
Where do you want it, Skinner?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.450
Not smart.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.800
Cool!

21:25.860 --> 21:27.360
Hey, when do we get
the check for this?

21:27.430 --> 21:29.240
Well, they said
they changed it
just enough

21:29.300 --> 21:31.170
so they don't have
to pay us.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.770
You know who
the real crooks are--

those sleazy
