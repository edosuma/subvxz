00:02.712 --> 00:05.339
This is daily notes log
for attempt number three

00:05.464 --> 00:06.966
of my Neighbourhood experiment.

00:08.801 --> 00:13.097
Obviously, I hope and assume
this will be the final version.

00:14.015 --> 00:15.808
No, I <i>know</i> it will be.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.936
All the kinks have been worked out.
This is the one.

00:20.062 --> 00:24.191
And after I pull this off,
they're gonna hang my picture

00:24.525 --> 00:27.236
in the Bad Place Hall of Fame
right next to the guy

00:27.570 --> 00:29.321
who invented bees with teeth.

00:32.074 --> 00:34.785
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.

00:35.161 --> 00:36.037
Cool.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.246
I'm Chris Baker.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.082
I'm your soulmate.
- Bring it in, man.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.295
Sorry, I must ask,
why are you wearing a sash

00:44.378 --> 00:46.338
that says "best person" on it?

00:46.464 --> 00:48.674
Apparently, I am the number one points-getter

00:48.758 --> 00:50.092
in the entire Neighbourhood.

00:50.176 --> 00:51.552
Is that so?

00:52.094 --> 00:54.096
I always have to have my sashes
custom-made

00:54.263 --> 00:56.390
due to my height and bosom size.

00:57.016 --> 00:59.143
Also, apparently,
sashes are out this season.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.813
The diagonal line really draws one's eye
to the chin bloat.

01:04.482 --> 01:06.734
Go fork yourself, you mean giraffe.

01:08.861 --> 01:12.406
Run! Giraffes! Giraffes! Run!

01:14.742 --> 01:17.620
Oh! Mean giraffes are destroying
the Neighbourhood.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.246
Gah!
- Oh, boy.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.709
Hey, robot slave lady?

01:24.210 --> 01:25.336
Busty Alexa?

01:25.961 --> 01:26.837
Oh, Janet?

01:26.921 --> 01:28.130
- Hi, there.
- Gah!

01:28.672 --> 01:29.548
Still not used to it.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.136
Uh, hey, what if I,
an already amazing person

01:34.220 --> 01:37.306
who definitely belongs here,
wanted to learn even more

01:37.431 --> 01:38.641
about how to be a good person?

01:39.225 --> 01:42.103
Is one of these nerds, like, a teacher
or a life coach

01:42.186 --> 01:43.854
or an Instagram fitness model
or something?

01:45.564 --> 01:48.359
Eleanor, I'd like you to meet
Chidi Anagonye.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.319
Chidi, this is Eleanor.

01:50.486 --> 01:52.988
Janet tells me you were
a professor of some kind.

01:53.114 --> 01:56.367
Yes, I was a professor of ethics
and moral philosophy

01:56.450 --> 01:57.827
focusing on deontology.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.620
Hang on one second, Chibi.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.414
This guy's too big of a nerd.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.332
Who else you got?

02:04.583 --> 02:06.210
Michael, what do we do here?
- I don't know.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.796
Apparently, the Bad Place knows
that one of you

02:09.130 --> 02:11.966
actually belongs down there with them,
and they want that person

02:12.174 --> 02:14.677
to get inside the obelisk,
or they're gonna take all of you.

02:14.844 --> 02:16.804
I can't go. I'm too young to die

02:17.012 --> 02:19.014
and too old to eat off the kids' menu.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.891
What a stupid age I am.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.351
I'd never survive down there.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.019
They should take Eleanor.
She's a pear shape.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.729
She'd fit right in.
- Oh, excuse me.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.398
You wish you could have a bite
of this pear.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.316
I'll go. I deserve to go.
You guys can stay.

02:32.611 --> 02:36.240
Holy forking shirt.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.993
You guys, don't you get it?

02:39.160 --> 02:40.911
Michael is torturing us.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.581
That's why our lives have been
so miserable

02:43.664 --> 02:44.957
since the moment we got here.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.627
This isn't the Good Place.
It's the Bad Place.

02:52.131 --> 02:53.591
Ah, farts.

03:01.432 --> 03:03.142
OK, attempt number 11.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.810
Let's focus on the positives.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.604
Eleanor always hates her house.

03:07.271 --> 03:08.731
Tahani always hates Eleanor.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.066
Jason hates being quiet.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.777
Chidi immediately gets a stomach ache.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.821
So there's a lot to work with here.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.908
Hang on one second, Cheeto.

03:19.783 --> 03:23.037
So it's gonna be a hard pass on
Superdork Jones over there.

03:23.329 --> 03:24.705
Anybody else you got to teach me?

03:24.997 --> 03:26.207
You guys ready for our lesson?

03:26.332 --> 03:30.419
We're talking David Hume today,
bundle theory of the self, baby.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.422
Sounds like a real banger,
but you guys gotta scram.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.383
My soulmate has some sort of surprise
planned for me

03:36.467 --> 03:38.052
and he seems very excited about it.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.679
Well, you two are certainly getting
along very well these days.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.974
Yeah, I'm actually kind of
into Sebastian lately.

03:44.141 --> 03:47.186
I mean, he's a little hokey,
but he's growing on me a little bit.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.523
My love, my sweet dewdrop

03:52.566 --> 03:58.030
I have written you a three-hour
spoken-word jazz opera.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.285
Cool!
<i>- ♪ Eleanor, less and more ♪</i>

04:03.869 --> 04:05.162

04:05.246 --> 04:08.082

04:10.918 --> 04:12.211
OK, no, no.
- What?

04:13.337 --> 04:18.467
No version of heaven for anyone
would ever include three hours of...

04:18.884 --> 04:19.760
this.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.512
We're in the Bad Place, aren't we?

04:22.346 --> 04:23.264
Damn it.

04:23.472 --> 04:27.101
That was a real trip for biscuits,
and now we're all wet, Daddy-O.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.395
I never even got to play
my stupid triangle.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.148
No, no, no, no
Michael, please, please, please!

04:33.565 --> 04:35.567
Please don't kill me.
I have so much to live for.

04:35.693 --> 04:38.570
I'm sorry, Janet, got to reboot you
every time I start over.

04:38.696 --> 04:41.073
Oh, I know.
I'm not actually upset.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.451
It's just the automatic fail-safe mechanism
that kicks in every time

04:44.535 --> 04:46.412
you approach the plunger.
Go ahead.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.580
Ah.
- Michael, you monster!

04:52.751 --> 04:53.877
Attempt 32.

04:55.421 --> 04:56.505
Attempt 57.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.590
Attempt 99.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.384
Attempt 108.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.594
I've analysed some recent data.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.931
Eleanor always seems to realise
that they're in the Bad Place

05:06.015 --> 05:07.808
- just at the moment that--
- Excuse me.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.227
Sorry, the door was open,
so I just came in.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.313
Did you just say I'm in the Bad Place?

05:13.522 --> 05:15.899
Attempt 109.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.110
I've closed and locked the door.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.280
Yep, and we're ready to go.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.116
This is your soulmate, Greg.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.035
This is your soulmate, Glenn.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.037
This is your soulmate, Tahani.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.747
This is your soulmate, Lerf.

05:29.872 --> 05:32.750
This is your soulmate,
a golden retriever.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.585
Hang on.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.502
Wait a minute.

05:35.544 --> 05:36.503
You know what?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.047
Holy smokes.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.632
<i>This</i> is the Bad Place.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.509
This is the Bad Place!

05:42.676 --> 05:44.345
This is the Bad Place.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.056
This is the Bad Place.
- The pig's getting angry.

05:47.306 --> 05:50.893
<i>This</i> is the Bad Place!
- Bees, bees, bees, bees!

05:51.477 --> 05:54.229
Oh! Oh, this is the Bad Place.
- Shh!

05:54.646 --> 05:57.483
Michael, Michael, if I'm gone,
who will take care of my birds?

05:58.984 --> 06:01.153
Michael, no, no, no, no, no!
I... I'm pregnant.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.363
And it's your baby.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.825
I have tickets to "Hamilton" next week,
and there's a rumour

06:06.950 --> 06:08.744
that Daveed Diggs is coming back.

06:08.911 --> 06:12.039
Janet, we've been through this
hundreds of times.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.832
I mean, can you just chill out?

06:14.333 --> 06:15.542
Is that possible, Janet?

06:15.667 --> 06:16.960
Can you just chill out a little?

06:17.086 --> 06:19.630
Nope, it's gonna be the same every time.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.424
Yeah, yeah, I know.

06:22.508 --> 06:23.717
No, no, no! No, Michael!

06:27.012 --> 06:28.430
Please, please, calm down.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.432
Calm down. Alright...

06:30.599 --> 06:32.476
OK, calm down. Calm down.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.938
I mean, why even bother at this point?

06:36.063 --> 06:38.607
I'm obviously never gonna get it right.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.943
"I'm Eleanor. I'm so smart."

06:41.026 --> 06:43.904
"I'm actually in the Bad Place."
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

06:44.113 --> 06:46.824
Shawn still thinks I'm on version two.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.743
I just keep lying to him,
and it's really bad, but I...

06:51.120 --> 06:53.414
I mean, I have to keep trying.
I'm in too deep.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.541
And I'm really fat right now.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.836
I'm stress-eating,
and I'm gaining weight in my thighs.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.671
I mean, look at that...

07:02.297 --> 07:03.507
Ugh.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.969
So sorry. Who are you?

07:07.553 --> 07:10.514
And where am I?
- It doesn't matter.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.808
This one doesn't even count.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.818
Hang on one second, Chili.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.363
This guy sucks.
Who else you got?

07:26.530 --> 07:27.406
I can hear you.

07:28.657 --> 07:31.910
Michael, you simply cannot expect Chidi
to decide whether Eleanor goes to the...

07:32.161 --> 07:34.997
Yo, yo, homies, check it.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.416
There's something messed up
with this place.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.168
We keep fighting with each other.

07:39.585 --> 07:42.087
None of the TVs
get the NFL RedZone channel.

07:43.005 --> 07:45.048
My soulmate doesn't even know
who Blake Bortles is.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.758
I know this sounds crazy

07:47.301 --> 07:50.262
but I think we're in the Bad Place.

07:51.597 --> 07:52.848
<i>Jason</i> figured it out?

07:53.765 --> 07:56.059
Jason?
This is a real low point.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.519
Yeah, this one hurts.

07:58.687 --> 07:59.688
Ow.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.274
OK, this might be the one.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.360
We're a week in.
Chidi's teaching Eleanor, but she hates it.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.697
Tahani still thinks that Jason's a monk.

08:09.615 --> 08:10.741
Everyone's miserable.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.451
I'm so happy.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.203
Fingers crossed.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.335
Vicky, where is everyone?

08:22.127 --> 08:23.378
They're not coming, Michael.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.964
You have lost control of this experiment

08:26.089 --> 08:29.384
so we are on strike
until our demands are met.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.514
I speak for the entire crew, Michael.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.723
We're sick of it.

08:34.806 --> 08:38.018
We can barely remember what we're supposed
to be doing anymore, plus...

08:38.060 --> 08:42.147
I spent weeks
perfecting this excellent Australian accent

08:42.189 --> 08:44.358
I did. And then I never got a chance
to use it.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.777
You're still upset about the size
of your part?

08:46.860 --> 08:49.112
Yes, I want a more important role.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.781
But that's just my demand.

08:50.906 --> 08:54.368
All 318 of us have something
we want to do differently.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.537
Some people want bigger houses.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.958
Gayle wants a different backstory
where she was an MMA fighter?

09:01.083 --> 09:05.921
Gunnar wants to bite and/or nibble
on humans while they sleep.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.381
You do know, Vicky

09:07.548 --> 09:10.759
that if I were to do some of these
that it would be a dead giveaway?

09:10.884 --> 09:12.844
And I can help you explain that to them.

09:13.595 --> 09:14.763
But some of these are doable.

09:15.639 --> 09:16.723
And you're gonna do 'em.

09:17.766 --> 09:23.105
So Aristotle believes your character
is voluntary, because, uh...

09:23.522 --> 09:24.815
are you ignoring me right now?

09:24.982 --> 09:28.902
It's day two of our ethics lessons,
and you're already tuning out?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.154
No, sorry, I just got distracted
for a second.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.657
The last thing I remember you saying is...

09:33.991 --> 09:34.866
nothing.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.577
Can you start from the beginning?

09:36.702 --> 09:38.620
OK, I need a little break.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.957
Can we take a walk or something,
maybe get some clam chowder?

09:48.213 --> 09:50.632
Where is everyone?
- Who knows?

09:51.174 --> 09:53.802
Maybe they finally figured out
clam chowder is disgusting

09:53.885 --> 09:56.847
cos it's basically a savoury latte
with bugs in it.

09:59.474 --> 10:02.102
Is someone smoking a cigar?

10:03.687 --> 10:05.439
Michael really screwed this up.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.399
The regular Bad Place was fine.

10:07.608 --> 10:10.736
If the four-headed flying bears
ain't broke, don't fix 'em.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.654
What was wrong with impaling?
I loved impaling.

10:13.572 --> 10:14.948
Hey, Todd, got a light?

10:15.532 --> 10:17.951
Uh, yeah, obviously I have a light.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.911
You know, you guys aren't
supposed to be smoking.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.872
You're supposed to keep
your human suit on.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.707
Those suits are really itchy for us.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.250
Who even cares if they see us?

10:25.542 --> 10:27.294
They're just gonna get rebooted anyway.

10:27.586 --> 10:30.213
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.798
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.259
This <i>is</i> the Bad Place! I forking knew it!

10:34.843 --> 10:36.511
And clam chowder <i>is</i> disgusting.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.890
It's just hot ocean milk
with dead animal croutons.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.391
OK, but what do we do, panic, freak?

10:41.475 --> 10:43.560
I usually panic, but I am happy to freak.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.896
We have to stay cool.
As my mum always used to say

10:47.022 --> 10:48.732
if a cop handcuffs you to a bike rack

10:48.940 --> 10:51.026
there's always something
you can gnaw through.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.111
Your mum always said that?

10:53.654 --> 10:54.613
Come on, brain.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.782
- Janet!
- Hi, there.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.617
How can I help you?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:58.700 --> 11:03.038
How do we know she's not a part of it?
- We don't, but we gotta risk it.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.166
Janet, can we, like, leave
the Neighbourhood

11:06.249 --> 11:09.503
get as far away as possible?
Is there anywhere we can go?

11:11.380 --> 11:15.926
So, we're in the Bad Place, and I know why.
Almond milk.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.053
I knew it was bad for the environment

11:18.178 --> 11:20.597
but I loved the way
it coated my tongue with a weird film.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.016
Who else is being tortured?
Are we the only two?

11:23.141 --> 11:25.977
I got to assume Jason is as well, Jianyu.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.438
You know him as Jianyu,
but his real name is Jason

11:28.522 --> 11:29.731
and he's a dirt bag from Florida.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.442
What?
- Also, Tahani is a candidate

11:32.567 --> 11:33.568
as far as I'm concerned.

11:33.652 --> 11:36.446
Yesterday, she told me
that she was Taylor Swift's best friend

11:36.780 --> 11:38.532
but Taylor Swift wasn't her best friend.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.117
She sucks.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.620
No offense, but I can't believe
you and I ended up in the same place.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.455
Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either, bud.

11:45.789 --> 11:48.375
I always assumed the afterlife was
full of cool people

11:48.500 --> 11:49.793
not talking sweater vests.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.336
- You...
- We're here.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.756
Aren't trains neat? Choo-choo!

12:02.806 --> 12:03.890
Hi. You gotta help us.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.392
I'm Eleanor. This is Chidi.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.269
And see, we thought we were
in the Good Place

12:07.394 --> 12:08.895
but as it turns out...
- Yeah, guys.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.898
I know. You've been here 15 times already.

12:12.065 --> 12:12.941
What?

12:13.316 --> 12:14.943
Did you bring the cocaine I asked for?

12:15.277 --> 12:17.446
Please tell me you somehow
remembered this time.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.614
Mama needs her medicine.

12:19.865 --> 12:20.824
We've met before?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.744
I'm Janet.
- I know.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.747
Vicky, let's look at the big picture here.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.750
Now, if you all can just stick with my plan

12:30.250 --> 12:32.544
and we pull it off, we'll be heroes.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.463
You could write your own ticket.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.799
You might even land
the "Jared from Subway" account.

12:37.883 --> 12:41.094
Yeah, but I don't think you can pull it off.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.014
You can't even pull off those bow ties.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.351
That was very mean,
but I'm gonna move past that

12:48.560 --> 12:49.936
in the name of unit cohesion.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.939
You're gonna reboot
those four dum-dums one more time

12:53.064 --> 12:54.649
and then I'm taking over.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.444
I'm going to execute my version
of this Neighbourhood.

12:57.861 --> 13:01.239
You see, I've been working on it
while all of your versions fell apart.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.742
This is insubordination.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.495
And if you do not do
what I tell you immediately

13:07.287 --> 13:09.039
you are going down.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.921
That's a complete report of every mistake
you've made, every screw-up

13:16.254 --> 13:20.300
every reboot all laid out
in excruciating detail.

13:20.675 --> 13:23.887
Now, I'm sure your boss would love
to hear all about how

13:24.012 --> 13:25.972
"attempt number 2" is really going.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.977
So actually, if you don't do what I say

13:31.144 --> 13:32.687
<i>you're</i> going down.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.689
Down under.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.444
Is it always the three of us?

13:39.528 --> 13:41.238
It's always at least Eleanor and Janet.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.031
Usually Chidi's in the mix.

13:43.532 --> 13:45.075
Sometimes Jason is here.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.494
One time, Jason <i>and</i> Tahani were here.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.663
But you know what?
No matter what the combo is

13:49.830 --> 13:52.916
I always ask you guys to bring me
cocaine next time, and you never do.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.876
Do you have anything I can snort?

13:55.001 --> 13:57.379
Like a crushed-up aspirin
or some eye-shadow or...

13:58.255 --> 13:59.798
cocaine?
- Still no.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.759
There's only one question
we need to answer right now

14:02.843 --> 14:04.386
and that is, what do we do next?

14:05.262 --> 14:07.264
I mean, this place doesn't seem terrible.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.558
Maybe we should just stay here forever.
- "Maybe we should just stay here forever."

14:09.891 --> 14:12.644
You always say that.
And you always end up going back.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.021
I mean, sometimes you go back
because you feel bad

14:15.146 --> 14:16.356
your friends don't know what you know.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.567
Sometimes you go back
because you walk in on me

14:18.733 --> 14:20.819
while I'm masturbating
and sometimes you go back

14:21.069 --> 14:23.321
because I walk in on you
while I'm masturbating.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.241
But no matter what, you always go back.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.619
You formulate a plan to defeat Michael,
and you head back.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.121
OK, a plan.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.998
We need a plan, but...

14:33.373 --> 14:34.708
What if we come up with a plan
- "What if we come up with a plan"

14:34.749 --> 14:36.167
we've already tried before?
- "we've already tried before?"

14:36.209 --> 14:37.544
Will you please stop that?
- "Will you please stop that?"

14:38.587 --> 14:42.924
Yeah, just to help you out a little,
I've written down every plan

14:43.008 --> 14:46.261
you've ever come up with,
which obviously never worked

14:46.386 --> 14:49.264
because you're here,
and you're back, so good luck.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.225
"Physically attack Michael.
Seduce Michael."

14:52.392 --> 14:54.519
"Make Michael think he's the one
in the Bad Place."

14:55.103 --> 14:57.814
"Catch that magic panda.
Use her powers."

14:58.773 --> 15:00.150
Oh, I'm guessing that was Jason.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.444
That guy has no idea what's going on.

15:05.488 --> 15:09.117
Hello? Hello.
Where is everyone?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.120
Janet?
- Hey, there, Jason.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.747
Oh, hey, homie.

15:14.581 --> 15:18.001
Uh, I mean... Jason?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.879
Who is Jason? I am a monk.

15:20.921 --> 15:21.922
You know what?

15:23.882 --> 15:25.467
Can I talk to you for a second?

15:25.842 --> 15:28.053
I'm in a tight spot,
and I could use someone

15:28.136 --> 15:30.388
to bounce some ideas off of, OK?

15:31.139 --> 15:34.768
Oh, yeah, real quick,
you're really in the Bad Place

15:34.893 --> 15:35.936
and you're being tortured.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.981
What?
- I know it says here that we already tried

15:40.106 --> 15:43.735
throwing Tahani under the bus,
but maybe we should revisit that.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.738
Throw her a little bit harder.
Maybe under a bigger bus.

15:46.905 --> 15:50.784
What do you think?
- I think this is pointless.

15:50.951 --> 15:54.537
We're trapped in a warped version
of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.207
Oh, cool, more philosophy.
<i>That'll</i> help us!

15:57.290 --> 15:58.124
Well, don't you see the problem?

15:58.375 --> 16:01.211
We are experiencing karma,
but we can't learn from our mistakes

16:01.336 --> 16:03.046
because our memories keep getting erased.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.881
It's an epistemological nightmare.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.425
Ugh, even your nightmares are boring.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.844
You... you are so mean, Eleanor.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.973
You're just like those childhood bullies
who said I would never get tenure.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.933
And you are so irritating!

16:15.141 --> 16:17.435
In one of these reboots,
I probably strangled you

16:17.519 --> 16:22.107
and then went to the Even Worse Place,
but you know what? I bet it was worth it.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.441
Oh, nice.

16:23.566 --> 16:29.030
Ugh! Sorry, can I just vent to you
for a second? Chidi is so annoying.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.659
I just... I cannot believe that he is the one
I'm stuck here with.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.536
Uh-huh, wow, crazy.

16:34.703 --> 16:38.540
Oh, sorry, Jeez, man, I thought you could
be human for, like, two seconds

16:38.665 --> 16:41.209
and listen to me.
- I have, Eleanor.

16:41.501 --> 16:45.714
I have listened to you talk about Chidi
15 times in 15 different ways.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.215
Let me just cut to the chase.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.801
You two, you got it bad for each other.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.304
No, we don't. Chidi's just a friend.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.639
What am I saying? He's not even a friend.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.100
He's just a weird teacher that I hate.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.981
Dude, I do not want to watch
"Cannonball Run 2" right now.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.568
Alright, what happened in the first one,
so I'm all caught up?

17:08.737 --> 17:12.323
<i>I don't know what's gonna happen to us,
but I need to tell you something.</i>

17:14.701 --> 17:15.618
<i>I love you.</i>

17:16.745 --> 17:20.498
<i>And you don't need to respond
cos I know you have trouble saying</i>

17:20.582 --> 17:21.875
<i>how you feel.
- I love you too.</i>

17:22.042 --> 17:23.376
Very funny

17:23.460 --> 17:25.587
but that... that's obviously not real.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.881
Oh, that's real, baby.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.632
That's real <i>nasty.</i>

17:31.009 --> 17:33.762
Yeah, this was, like, the sixth time
you guys were here.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.181
I saw you getting sexy
the previous three times

17:36.264 --> 17:38.391
so I cut a little hole in the wall
so I could tape you.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.268
Call it my lookin' hole.

17:40.769 --> 17:44.064
<i>- Is that a camera?
- Mindy, you pervert!</i>

17:46.441 --> 17:48.526
How many times have Chidi
and I slept together?

17:48.651 --> 17:51.613
Eight different days, but, like,
20 different sessions.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.366
And how many times did we say... that stuff?

17:55.492 --> 17:57.786
Oh, only once. Oh, God, I hated it.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.788
It, like, really killed the vibe for me.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.582
See, after I watch the porno
I made starring you

18:03.083 --> 18:05.126
I watch you talk about your feelings
to cool down.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.753
It's, like, anti-porn.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.841
I've only ever said "I love you"
to two men my entire life -

18:12.300 --> 18:13.927
Stone Cold Steve Austin

18:14.677 --> 18:16.137
and a guy in a dark club

18:16.596 --> 18:18.932
who I mistook for Stone Cold Steve Austin.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.976
I mean, why would you show me that?
- I don't know.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.271
You guys are, like, trapped here together.
I feel bad.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.232
You know, I'm rooting for you guys.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.901
No, there is no "us guys."
We basically just met each other.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.277
No, Eleanor.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.072
You guys have known each other
a really long time.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.492
Also, it doesn't matter if I told you
that or not

18:37.534 --> 18:40.537
because when Michael finds out
he's failed again, he'll just reboot you.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.250
Chidi, Janet, we're leaving.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.629
I am taking this with me.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.674
"Oh, no, it's my only copy." Don't...

18:57.679 --> 18:59.264
<i>How did it come to this?</i>

19:00.140 --> 19:03.685
I was just trying to do something
innovative and different

19:03.810 --> 19:05.061
that would improve the way

19:05.311 --> 19:08.148
we make humans' lives miserable
for eternity.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.066
Mm, well...
- Shut up.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.652
What are my options?
Do I have any?

19:13.903 --> 19:17.490
I mean, I can't go along with her plan.
It'll be a spectacular failure.

19:17.615 --> 19:21.244
But I can't ignore her
or she'll rat me out to Shawn.

19:21.536 --> 19:24.914
I'm trapped.
- You're saying a lot of words right now

19:25.248 --> 19:29.460
and I only know some of them,
like "rat" and "Jason"

19:29.836 --> 19:32.797
but I know a little wisdom I can give you.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.508
I know everything that happened in your life

19:35.884 --> 19:38.553
and it was all stupid,
so I highly doubt that.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.931
I was a member of a 60-person dance crew
in Jacksonville.

19:42.473 --> 19:46.644
We were called "Dance Dance Resolution:
We Resolve To Dance."

19:47.312 --> 19:49.898
One day, Donkey Doug and I got into a fight

19:50.231 --> 19:52.817
because I'd framed his girlfriend
for boogie board theft

19:52.984 --> 19:56.863
so he started a new dance crew
called "Hashtag DougLife"

19:57.071 --> 19:59.991
and immediately challenged us
to a dance-off.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.245
He said, "Meet us inside the abandoned
orange juice factory at midnight."

20:04.913 --> 20:09.626
That night, as the clock struck 12:00,
me and my crew came together

20:10.043 --> 20:13.755
with a determination we had
never shown before

20:15.340 --> 20:16.799
and slashed all their tyres.

20:18.426 --> 20:19.344
It was dope.

20:20.303 --> 20:21.346
The end.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.806
By Jason Mendoza.

20:25.016 --> 20:28.811
You know, that inane story
actually contains a bit of good advice.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.481
Thank you, Jason.
- You got it, homie.

20:32.857 --> 20:36.778
I give good advice!
Guess that's why I'm in the Good Place.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.116
Oh, there you guys are.
- No.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.868
Stop, no more lies.

20:44.535 --> 20:45.703
Jason, get over here.

20:46.037 --> 20:48.915
That's right. We know his name is Jason,
not Jianyu.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.166
We know everything.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.753
I don't understand much of it,
but, yeah, I know it.

20:53.878 --> 20:57.465
Your sick torture plan is not working, OK?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.467
Cos we keep figuring out your little puzzle.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.262
We're winning, which means you're losing.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.138
So you have two choices here, buddy.

21:04.222 --> 21:07.892
Keep failing over and over
or realise we're actually

21:07.976 --> 21:09.310
the ones with all the power here.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.062
Yeah, no, uh...

21:11.646 --> 21:13.189
We're on the same page.
- What?

21:13.356 --> 21:14.607
I want to team up with you guys.

21:14.899 --> 21:17.026
What? Why? You do? What?

21:17.402 --> 21:19.946
I'm in a bit of a bind,
and I could use some back-up

21:20.029 --> 21:22.448
or as Jason put it, um...

21:22.532 --> 21:23.825
I need a new dance crew.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.202
So, what do you say?
New best friends?

21:28.121 --> 21:28.997
Stop it...
