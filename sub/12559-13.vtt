AUNT BUNNY NEEDS. VVOULD YOU GET IT FILLED?

11:35.069 --> 11:37.151
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HER?

11:37.238 --> 11:40.026
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY
THING THE MATTER VVITH ME, HILDY.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.691
I'M REALLY SHOCKED AT HOW
OLD DR. FLOYD IS GETTING.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.777
I THINK THE POOR OLD DEAR OUGHT
TO PUT HIMSELF OUT TO PASTURE.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.988
HE THINKS YOU OUGHT
TO GET SOME REST.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.870
VVHY? I'M NOT THE LEAST BIT TIRED.
HE'S THE ONE VVHO NEEDS TO REST.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.035
<i>DID YOU NOTICE HOW
HIS HAND TREMBLES?</i>

11:53.087 --> 11:55.704
HE LEFT THIS PRESCRIPTION FOR
SOMETHING TO HELP YOU RELAX.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.124
BUD'S GOING TO THE DRUGSTORE
TO GET IT FILLED.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.552
AND VVHILE VVE'RE VVAITING, VVHY DON'T YOU
JUST LIE DOVVN AND TRY TO TAKE IT EASY?

12:01.638 --> 12:03.970
MM-HM, AND I CAN JUST HEAR
WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY,

12:04.057 --> 12:06.765
"BUNNY DIDN'T DROP IN TO SEE
ANY OF HER OLD FRIENDS.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.183
SHE'S GETTING UPPITY,
AND SHE PUTS ON AIRS."

12:09.270 --> 12:11.887
I CAN EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT
YOU WEREN'T FEELING WELL.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.973
BOBBI VVOODSON USED TO BE MY BEST FRIEND.

EXORUOIATING CRUSH HE USED TO HA\/E ON ME?

12:18.613 --> 12:20.820
WHATEVER
HAPPENED TO BEN?

12:20.907 --> 12:23.990
HE'S STILL HERE. HE RUNS THE TELEVISION
STATION. NOVV, LISTEN, BUNNY-

12:24.077 --> 12:28.071
I COULD HA\/E MARRIED THAT OLD BOY. I'\/E GOT
A GOOD MIND TO VVALK IN AND SURPRISE HIM.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.451
BUNNY, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.919

A RING-A-DING FISH.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.587
THAT MUST BE \/ERY INTERESTING
FOR YOUR NEIGHBORS.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.846

COMPLAINED SO FAR.

<i>BUD, WANNA GO FOR A WALK
AND SAY “HEY“ TO PEOPLE'?</i>

12:50.853 --> 12:52.355
THE DOCTOR WANTS
YOU TO REST.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.930
HE ALSO SAID I NEEDED
SOME FRESH AIR.

12:54.983 --> 12:59.147
VVILL YOU AT LEAST VVAIT UNTIL BUD COMES
BACK FROM THE DRUGSTORE VVITH YOUR MEDICINE?

12:59.237 --> 13:02.855
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA. I'LL DRIVE
TO THE DRUGSTORE VVITH YOU.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.316
