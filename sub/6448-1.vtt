I'm afraid I can't do that.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.475
Excuse me?

35:18.866 --> 35:22.233
I had to wait until we were locked down
for the night...

You're Kandorian?

And I have a message from Major Zod.

Tell me where the Blur is...

35:40.638 --> 35:42.253
...or you die.

-You ﬁnd a lead on the Kandorian?
-l've run every play in my playbook...

35:56.279 --> 35:59.942
...to try and access Tess' ﬁles but
she's got one hell of a defensive line.

I've only counted 100 ﬁrewalls...

I'm actually about to score.

STUART [ON SCREEN]: Greetings,
estimable foe, whoever you are.

36:16.757 --> 36:19.590
Now, I'm guessing,
since you've made it this far...

36:19.760 --> 36:23.628
you probably haven 't slept
and your ﬁngers are getting cramped up.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.969
So I thought I would take it upon myself
to do you a big favor...

talk to these hands.

Nice work, Chloe.

is Tess' tech boy wonder.

heavyweight hacking of his own.

Wow, we could do a lot
with this kind of leverage.

Maybe even get him to join us.

You'd even match.

get close, he'd show up and block me.

it's been a long time...

-...since he looked that happy.
-Clark, just stop, okay?

37:36.170 --> 37:40.504
Your willingness to sacriﬁce yourself
for others is a great strength for sure.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.667
But when it comes to your own
happiness, it's a weakness.
