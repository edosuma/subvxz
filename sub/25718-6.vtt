WEBVTT

00:46.755 --> 00:48.631
Take it easy. Have a good day.

00:51.593 --> 00:52.719
Take it easy.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.767
Why did they send you?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.602
-A little higher.
-Is this good?

01:00.685 --> 01:01.895
FUN TIMES WITH CHEMISTRY

01:01.978 --> 01:03.271
A little higher.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.355
This is the pub of chemistry department.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.984
Come visit our pub!

01:08.068 --> 01:08.985
Come visit us!

01:09.069 --> 01:10.695
We've prepared many fun things.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.447
Everyone, come visit us!

01:12.530 --> 01:14.449
We'll have food, too.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.659
What's taking the girls so long?

01:16.743 --> 01:19.829
-They're getting ready.
-Gosh, I can't wait to see them.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.044
I wish I was born as a pretty girl
so that I could just take orders.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.228
That's the uniform?

01:43.853 --> 01:46.231
-I don't like it.
-Me, neither.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.691
You picked the design with them.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.151
BASED ON THE WEBCOMINC
<i>MY</i> <i>ID IS GANGNAM</i> <i>BEAUTY</i> BY KI MAENG-GI

01:50.235 --> 01:53.071
Well, Jung-yeob and Jung-ho said
it was nice, so I just went along with it.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.491
The skirt looked a bit longer
on the photo.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.578
What do you think?
Will you be okay?

02:02.664 --> 02:04.040
I'm a bit...

02:04.707 --> 02:05.542
You don't like it?

02:06.376 --> 02:08.294
Let's not wear this
if she doesn't like it.

02:08.377 --> 02:09.586
Why are you putting it on me?

02:09.670 --> 02:11.214
Are we allowed to not wear it?

02:11.881 --> 02:13.842
What are you doing?
It'll begin soon.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.803
Our bar will be packed.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.305
You girls look exactly as I imagined.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.558
None of us imagined this.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.686
Is it a bit too short?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.730
It's not.
I've seen many girls in skirts like this.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.067
What should we do?

02:31.151 --> 02:32.861
You all look great in it.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.445
Stand right there.

02:34.529 --> 02:38.533
I'll take a nice photo of you
to remember this moment.

02:38.616 --> 02:39.450
Strike a pose.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.035
-Customers will be...
-Come on.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.913
All right, 1, 2.
Smile, please.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.290
Here we go.
1, 2.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.876
You all look gorgeous.
All right, one more time.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.419
1, 2.

02:51.462 --> 02:54.382
Oh, the chemistry department?
I'll definitely come by.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.968
I wonder which bar has the hottest guys.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.554
A pancake
and a serving of assorted skewers.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.556
-A pancake and assorted skewers?
-Yes.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.057
-Sure.
-Water, please.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.767
Sure. Just a moment, please.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.729
-Anything else you need?
-No, we're good.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.647
-Your food will be out soon.
-Okay.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.817
Excuse me. We'd like a pancake.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.694
Sure, I'll bring it over shortly.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.572
Hey, we already ordered one
just a minute ago.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.451
-Another pancake.
-To tell you the truth...

03:21.534 --> 03:23.369
I was going to tell you. Gosh.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.997
-Actually, this was the reason.
-Seriously.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.291
-Because of this?
-You always...

03:28.374 --> 03:30.501
Jung-boon has many guy friends.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.254
She knows a lot of people.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.089
She knows everyone from her school.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.762
Oh, boy. Why do you even live?

03:41.930 --> 03:45.934
<i>I've never had a guy friend in my life.</i>

03:49.020 --> 03:50.772
Excuse me, where can we sit?

03:51.356 --> 03:52.357
Oh, this way...

03:57.987 --> 03:59.113
Hey, Kang Orc.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.241
I'm calling you, Kang Orc.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.702
You don't know your nickname?

04:04.786 --> 04:06.204
You're lying, right?

04:06.287 --> 04:07.789
Tell me that it's a lie!

04:08.373 --> 04:10.250
-Yong-Cheol.
-Kang Orc.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.794
I'll kill you if you tell anybody
that you like me.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.545
You'd better not tell anyone.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.214
<i>I didn't think...</i>

04:17.966 --> 04:20.343
<i>I'd see him ever again.</i>

04:27.308 --> 04:29.269
-Hey, you made it.
-Yes, hi.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.313
-Is he your friend?
-Yes, my new friend.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.564
Through Instagram.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.945
The pretty friend I mentioned.
You saw her in my photo.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.283
Park Yong-cheol and his friends.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.076
Kang Mi-rae and Lee Ji-hyo.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.744
Hi, nice to meet you.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.791
Nice to meet you.
I should get back to work.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.376
Kang Mi-rae?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.170
What's wrong?

04:56.337 --> 04:58.089
I know someone with the same name.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.258
Really? A friend of yours?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.385
My middle school alumna.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.267
Have a seat here.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.162
-Did you call the police?
-I did, as I was firing her.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.831
I feel too apologetic towards Jung-boon.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.791
You should apologize to her then.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.878
I mean, I feel too sorry to apologize.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.880
Then apologize
for being really sorry.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.466
Let's go.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.426
Go where?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.471
Our department's bar.
Jung-boon should be there.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.931
Will you be with me?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.642
-Are you a kid?
-Gosh.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.979
What are you doing? Let's go.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.732
So which school do you go to?

05:58.024 --> 06:01.444
I'm studying psychology
at Hankook University.

06:02.362 --> 06:06.491
Psychology at Hankook University?
Your grades must've been very high.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.408
Gosh, no.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.079
By the way, why didn't you choose
practical music?

06:12.372 --> 06:15.958
I'm a huge fan of Tiger JK.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.544
I saw him on a TV show, and he said

06:18.628 --> 06:23.216
he recommends choosing something else
for your major if you want to be a rapper.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.812
Tiger JK, she's a huge fan of yours.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.939
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.902
She's a student,
but she wants to be a rapper.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.071
I asked her to come by.

06:45.154 --> 06:47.323
Okay, then could you show us?

06:47.865 --> 06:48.699
Sure.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.457
-Ready?
-Yes.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.834
I'll drop the beat.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.835
Okay.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.850
<i>I wear mismatching shoes</i>
<i>And I start running backwards</i>

07:13.933 --> 07:15.726
<i>People tell me I'm imperfect</i>

07:15.852 --> 07:17.854
<i>But no, I'm perfect</i>

07:17.979 --> 07:20.648
<i>I have my own way of survival...</i>

07:22.108 --> 07:24.819
<i>A life that's lacking is imperfect...</i>

07:27.363 --> 07:28.322
I'm sorry.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.658
It's okay.
Give it a try one more time.

07:31.242 --> 07:34.662
Okay, I'm sorry.
I should've practiced a bit more.

07:34.745 --> 07:35.997
I'll try one more time.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.832
-One more time, let's go.
-Let's go.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.044
Here's the beat.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.440
-That's why you can't do it.
-Gosh.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.195
Jung-boon, can we talk for a minute?

08:07.278 --> 08:08.696
Do you know him?

08:08.821 --> 08:10.406
-Who is he?
-Who is he?

08:10.531 --> 08:13.117
-Is there something wrong?
-No, I'll be right back.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.285
Don't take too long.

08:14.368 --> 08:15.286
Excuse me.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.579
Let's drink.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.539
-Cheers.
-He's out of alcohol.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.416
Pour him a drink.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.834
You're better-looking.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.631
Tae-young, I have something to tell you.

08:27.048 --> 08:30.593
-What is it?
-I'm not feeling so well.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.929
Can I take a short break?

08:33.011 --> 08:34.429
Do you feel sick?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.058
-I'm just a little tired.
-Oh, really?

08:39.143 --> 08:41.102
Someone will have to take your place.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.440
I'll do it.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.155
Kyung-seok?
I thought you didn't want to.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.448
I'll take your place.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.539
I guess you're loyal after all.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.042
Huh? He said he wasn't going to come,
but he did.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.753
You said you didn't want to do it.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.880
Are you here as a customer?

09:07.964 --> 09:10.132
No, I'm here to serve.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.384
Glad you're here.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.302
He is not too disloyal, I guess.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.391
-Let's go.
-It smells here.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.524
-Are there green onions in here?
-Green onions?

09:27.441 --> 09:30.695
<i>What if Yong-cheol recognizes Kyung-seok?</i>

09:36.617 --> 09:37.618
Is he in your major?

09:38.286 --> 09:39.870
Who? Kyung-seok?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.999
-He used to go to my middle school.
-Really?

09:43.082 --> 09:44.834
Mi-rae wen to the same one as well.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.545
Oh, the pretty girl you saw earlier.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.047
Mi-rae and Kyung-seok are
from the same middle school.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.521
Do you feel sick?

10:09.233 --> 10:10.985
No, I'm just tired.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.280
Thank you.
I'm going to go get some rest.

10:14.822 --> 10:15.906
Mi-rae.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.242
Just a second.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.244
What? Why?

10:21.203 --> 10:22.079
Kyung-seok.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.459
Can you help me carry this? It's so heavy.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.253
Hey, I'll carry it for you.
You shouldn't.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.463
Kyung-seok.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.800
Hello. Do you need anything?

10:36.344 --> 10:39.430
-Since when were you friends with her?
-He's so manly.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.688
Yong-cheol went to the same school as you.

10:52.276 --> 10:55.488
Are you Kang Mi-rae
from Jaryong Middle School?

11:00.034 --> 11:00.868
Yes.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.828
I'm Park Yong-cheol.
You remember me?

11:04.538 --> 11:05.498
Yes.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.958
So you guys do know each other.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.627
This is so cool.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.632
-What a joke.
-Why?

11:14.965 --> 11:16.842
What? No, it's nothing.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.432
I'm sorry.

11:23.724 --> 11:26.894
You took that thief's side
and treated me like a liar.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.522
To be honest,
I don't really know you that well.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.483
Then how well did you know her?

11:33.567 --> 11:35.778
I'm too naive to make the right judgments.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.656
I couldn't see what a brat she was.
You're so nice...

11:39.907 --> 11:43.327
Gosh, I'm such a stupid jerk.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.871
I'm the one to blame.
I shouldn't have done that.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.753
You just laughed, didn't you?
I think I saw you laugh.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.384
Thank you so much.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.469
And I'm sorry.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.597
People can make mistakes.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.099
Will you forgive me, then?

12:05.182 --> 12:07.685
Well, you keep apologizing,

12:07.768 --> 12:08.978
so I should forgive you.

12:09.937 --> 12:13.733
My gosh, I seriously had trouble
breathing earlier.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.776
I can finally breathe now.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.486
Thank you.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.113
And I'm sorry.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.176
You guys must be really glad
to see each other.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.261
What a small world.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.347
I should've been nicer to you
if I knew you'd become pretty.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.349
My gosh.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.019
Are you guys not working?

12:50.102 --> 12:53.105
Just give us a minute.
They're from the same school.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.358
That's so cool. How amazing.

12:56.942 --> 13:00.237
I hope you guys all have a great time.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.201
I hope you guys have fun.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.286
Do you still hate me?

13:09.038 --> 13:09.914
Kyung-seok.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.793
I heard he went to the same middle school
as you.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.464
Did you do something wrong?

13:18.547 --> 13:22.176
I can already guess what happened.
He must've had crush on her.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.762
It was actually the opposite.
She liked me a lot.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.350
Have you gone mad?

13:29.433 --> 13:30.935
She told me that she liked me.

13:31.685 --> 13:32.561
Didn't you?

13:36.690 --> 13:37.858
You should go now.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.778
How can you tell me to leave?
I'm a customer.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.447
-Just leave.
-Come on, I'm really glad to meet...

13:44.824 --> 13:47.076
-Kang Orc again.
-Hey.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.328
-She's the orc?
-She's the orc?

13:55.334 --> 13:57.795
-She's the orc I told you about.
-Hey!

14:07.263 --> 14:08.430
Follow me.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.433
I just talked about the good old days.
Are you upset?

14:14.728 --> 14:17.064
-Yong-cheol.
-I said, follow me.

14:17.147 --> 14:19.692
How scary. Hey, Mi-rae.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.528
Don't flatter yourself.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.035
Yes.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.707
After I changed, I could finally see...

14:35.833 --> 14:37.793
that people like you were worthless jerks.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.420
What?

14:43.048 --> 14:44.800
You didn't change at all.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.347
You look down on people
based on their looks and harass them.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.644
You better remember this
every time you remember "Kang Orc."

14:57.104 --> 14:58.230
To me, you were just...

14:59.440 --> 15:00.816
a piece of trash.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.444
What did you say?

15:17.416 --> 15:20.085
Hey, you totally ruined the mood.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.422
Hey, wait.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.258
Hey, scumbag.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.597
-What?
-Scumbag.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.684
Pay for your food.

15:37.811 --> 15:38.896
Shit.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.484
Sua, I'll call you again later.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.196
How could you do that to your old friend?

16:08.926 --> 16:10.552
It was a failure.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.847
What's wrong with your voice, by the way?

16:14.807 --> 16:15.849
What?

16:16.225 --> 16:18.811
Who? Park Yong-cheol?

16:19.937 --> 16:21.897
Why did he come all of a sudden?

16:22.564 --> 16:25.818
How many surgeries did she do
that he didn't even recognize her?

16:26.026 --> 16:27.778
Didn't Kyung-seok recognize her?

16:27.861 --> 16:32.491
No, come to think of it,
he didn't recognize her at first either.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.202
So nothing on her face is original?

16:36.537 --> 16:38.872
It must've changed
because she got surgeries.

16:39.707 --> 16:43.919
Did she not recognize Yong-cheol either?
Or did she act like she didn't know?

16:45.212 --> 16:48.465
Anyway, it's the worst nickname
I've ever heard of.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.467
How could he call her orc?

16:57.808 --> 16:59.435
<i>She's the orc I told you about.</i>

17:00.269 --> 17:02.479
Don't flatter yourself.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.648
<i>My face may change,</i>

17:06.316 --> 17:08.359
<i>but my past never changes.</i>

17:08.444 --> 17:09.653
Mi-rae.

17:22.499 --> 17:26.252
I shouldn't have invited people
I barely knew.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.675
They came to see me at the cafe I work at,

17:32.384 --> 17:34.678
so I only invited them to the festival.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.973
I didn't know he was such a jerk.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.350
Sorry.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.020
It's not your fault.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.355
No, I'm really sorry.

17:45.439 --> 17:48.901
This wouldn't have happened
if it hadn't been for me.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.655
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.699
I want to worry about it.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.661
I want to be better to you.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.292
You see,

18:06.627 --> 18:08.962
I actually had a prejudice...

18:09.671 --> 18:11.215
about plastic surgeries.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.595
Why would they want to become prettier
than others that much?

18:16.678 --> 18:18.347
I thought it was too vain.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.976
But I realized...

18:24.728 --> 18:27.147
that some people could be desperate
for it.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.861
That some might be in pain
due to their faces.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.161
Do you think you can go back and work?

18:41.787 --> 18:44.748
I'll tell Tae-young
if you think you can't.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.220
I can't see Sua anymore because of you.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.681
Why can't we?
We can see her without him.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.100
Guys, you are excluding me
just for a girl?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.310
Hey, Park Yong-cheol.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.650
You remember me?

19:11.733 --> 19:13.443
Oh Hyun-jung, Mi-rae's friend.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.487
So what?

19:16.488 --> 19:19.324
I just can't understand
why you showed up here.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.535
You bullied her enough in middle school.

19:21.618 --> 19:24.371
I had no idea.
I only came because Sua invited me.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.792
Why would she invite someone like you?

19:28.876 --> 19:32.045
Hey, she asked me to be friends first.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.548
She visited my Instagram
and liked my pictures.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.133
You saw it too, right?

19:36.508 --> 19:37.342
Hold on.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.055
See?

19:46.310 --> 19:48.103
COMMENTS

19:53.901 --> 19:55.444
So she left?

19:55.527 --> 19:58.989
I told her to go
and that I'd explain to you.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.325
It can't be helped then.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.036
But I have to go
to my part-time job now, too.

20:04.119 --> 20:04.953
Really?

20:06.163 --> 20:09.499
Can you walk around the school
to promote our bar before you go?

20:09.958 --> 20:11.335
Okay, thank you.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.920
-Thanks.
-Tae-young.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.504
I think I have to go, too.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.798
Who's going to serve then?

20:17.925 --> 20:19.343
I mean, think about it.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.511
It should be done by the girls.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.308
Park Yong-cheol, that guy is really weird.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.811
How could he say such a thing
to an old friend?

20:30.646 --> 20:31.605
It's upsetting.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.982
COME VISIT THE CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT BAR

20:34.066 --> 20:35.150
You brought him here.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.738
I didn't know he'd be like that.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.451
Who on earth came up with that nickname?

20:45.118 --> 20:46.995
How could they do that to a girl?

20:48.288 --> 20:50.290
She wouldn't have been that ugly.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.418
She was cute.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.425
Mi-rae was cute.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.776
<i>I actually had a prejudice...</i>

21:18.235 --> 21:19.861
<i>about plastic surgeries.</i>

21:20.988 --> 21:22.656
<i>But I realized...</i>

21:24.324 --> 21:26.660
that some people could be
desperate for it.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.997
That some might be in pain
due to their faces.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.132
MS. NA HYE-SUNG

21:45.512 --> 21:46.722
Hello, ma'am.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.266
I got the candles.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.101
My employees said

21:51.727 --> 21:53.478
their scent was amazing.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.024
What are you doing right now?

21:57.107 --> 21:58.734
I have time right now.

21:59.943 --> 22:01.903
No, not in front of the school.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.239
I'll go to your company.

22:07.743 --> 22:11.663
Okay. Then I'll go to your house.

22:13.874 --> 22:14.833
Okay.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.722
-Did Ye-na leave?
-She left for her appointment.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.558
The okay-looking girl left.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.019
Make the boys do the job instead.

22:34.102 --> 22:37.147
Girls should serve at the bar.
No one's interested if guys do.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.649
We should be enough.
It's almost over.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.569
Not every girl can be considered
a real woman.

22:43.070 --> 22:46.823
It would've been nice if you prepared
for a situation like this like I advised.

22:47.074 --> 22:50.786
Even if we put the uniform aside,
your looks aren't qualified.

22:52.704 --> 22:53.789
What did you say?

22:53.872 --> 22:57.042
You first have to grow your hair
to look like a girl, Yoon-byul.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.086
And I told you to lose weight.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.672
And you should smile a bit.
Girls should do that.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.591
Who are you to order me around?

23:04.674 --> 23:05.967
Don't talk back, freshman.

23:08.637 --> 23:09.471
I quit.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.724
-Make food like you've been doing.
-I won't do that either.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.977
-I won't do anything. Don't look for me.
-Where are you going?

23:17.354 --> 23:19.523
Why do I have to do this
and put up with your crap?

23:20.816 --> 23:22.901
I can't take your stupid remarks anymore.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.404
Do you think we can't criticize you?

23:26.196 --> 23:28.365
I simply didn't want to stoop
as low as you.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.909
-Ugly punks.
-What?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.869
-Let's go.
-Guys.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.081
-What's wrong?
-They've suddenly become sensitive.

23:36.164 --> 23:38.250
They're getting mad at our jokes.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.544
Did we ever tell you that you're ugly?

23:40.627 --> 23:42.254
I only gave you suggestions!

23:42.337 --> 23:44.965
Stop it!
We don't want to hear your suggestions.

23:46.299 --> 23:47.968
What's with you, Tae-hee?

23:48.635 --> 23:52.806
"You'll look pretty when you lose weight"?
Are you saying that I'm a loser this way?

23:52.889 --> 23:53.849
No...

23:53.932 --> 23:56.977
"Do plastic surgeries, grow hair,
change your style, lose weight."

23:57.060 --> 24:00.147
Should we get back at you the same?
You'll make all the fuss.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.983
How could you twist his good intention?

24:03.066 --> 24:05.485
He only meant
your face looks cute and pretty.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.196
I didn't ask you to say that I'm pretty.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.908
We're not products on display.
You judge us by our looks.

24:13.535 --> 24:17.080
Keep such thoughts to yourselves.
How dare you say that bluntly to us?

24:19.291 --> 24:20.208
I'm out, too.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.668
I told you to stay put.

24:23.086 --> 24:25.046
So do I have to do everything I'm told?

24:25.505 --> 24:27.299
Who are you to order us around?

24:27.716 --> 24:28.925
Let's quit and leave.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.971
Hey. Goodness.

24:33.096 --> 24:34.848
Hey.

24:36.516 --> 24:40.937
I told them out of concern, and how could
they behave this way to their senior--

24:41.021 --> 24:42.898
-Stop it.
-Think about their attitude.

24:42.981 --> 24:43.899
That's enough.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.277
Where are you going?

25:01.208 --> 25:02.292
I'm sorry.

25:02.792 --> 25:05.128
I should've scolded them earlier.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.924
I let it slide because things were hectic
with the festival.

25:10.926 --> 25:11.801
Sorry.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.224
Please don't be upset.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.518
You know what's more irritating?

25:21.394 --> 25:24.898
I keep trying to fit myself
in their standards unconsciously.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.234
I always tell myself to lose weight.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.902
You don't need to.

25:29.027 --> 25:33.198
They're doing that to see you flustered.
It is fun for them.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.577
Besides, I don't like girls
who are too skinny.

25:40.539 --> 25:44.709
There are many men who like
cute, chubby girls like you, like me.

25:50.423 --> 25:53.635
Well, I'm not just talking about looks.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.513
The way you talk and behave.
You're cute in many ways.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.558
Anyway, you don't need to change.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.227
Don't let it stress you out.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.316
Feel better now?

26:09.985 --> 26:10.944
I'll go, then.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.068
<i>Where are you?</i>

26:55.488 --> 26:57.991
I've always wanted to sit here
and eat ice cream,

26:58.074 --> 27:01.745
but doing that alone would look weird.
I mean, this isn't coffee.

27:02.245 --> 27:03.163
Right.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.461
The favor I asked you
must've stressed you out.

27:10.086 --> 27:11.004
I'm sorry.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.381
No, it's okay.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.009
I really wanted to do it for you,

27:16.092 --> 27:18.720
but I couldn't persuade Kyung-seok.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.598
Is everything well with him?

27:22.515 --> 27:25.393
Yes, I think so.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.229
Are you two close?

27:29.439 --> 27:30.774
Yes, I guess...

27:31.358 --> 27:32.859
we are pretty close.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.320
We went to the same middle school, too.

27:35.403 --> 27:36.321
Did you?

27:36.988 --> 27:40.241
Which one? He transferred schools
during his middle school years.

27:41.576 --> 27:43.161
Jaryong Middle School.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.873
You have known each other since then.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.544
We did know of each other,

27:52.253 --> 27:53.963
but we weren't close back then.

27:56.216 --> 28:00.053
What was he like in middle school?

28:00.136 --> 28:01.971
He was very popular.

28:02.847 --> 28:03.765
Was he?

28:04.891 --> 28:06.851
He's very handsome, you know.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.980
I guess I'm not the only person
who thinks that.

28:13.066 --> 28:16.778
I saw him once from far away
when he was in middle school.

28:18.488 --> 28:19.489
Only once...

28:20.740 --> 28:22.283
for a brief moment.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.370
I could see how much he had grown.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.414
And he's all grown up now.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.506
I actually met you
when I was in middle school.

28:37.799 --> 28:38.633
Me?

28:39.592 --> 28:40.593
Yes.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.262
When?

28:43.596 --> 28:45.807
You may not remember it though.

28:49.352 --> 28:52.731
Even if you remember me from that day,
you won't recognize my face.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.820
I had plastic surgery.

28:59.612 --> 29:00.739
I got everything done.

29:04.784 --> 29:07.203
By the way, where did we meet?

29:09.122 --> 29:11.958
That day, I was so upset.

29:14.961 --> 29:18.882
To tell you the truth,
I had a tough time growing up...

29:19.591 --> 29:21.050
because of my face.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.597
<i>Even I thought...</i>

29:26.222 --> 29:29.017
<i>that no one could be uglier than me.</i>

29:30.143 --> 29:32.937
<i>Even I thought</i>
<i>that I looked like a monster.</i>

30:02.258 --> 30:03.176
Hey.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.929
Are you having a hard time?

30:07.096 --> 30:08.473
My classmates...

30:09.474 --> 30:11.559
say that I'm too ugly.

30:15.855 --> 30:17.649
They call me an orc.

30:18.608 --> 30:21.069
They say that my face is worse
than garbage.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.022
That must be so hard.

31:05.822 --> 31:07.031
No matter what they say,

31:08.241 --> 31:11.911
you are the most precious person
to yourself.

31:16.624 --> 31:17.917
<i>That's when I learned...</i>

31:19.085 --> 31:21.212
<i>that kind words and nice scents...</i>

31:21.838 --> 31:23.673
<i>can even save someone's life.</i>

31:26.092 --> 31:27.135
<i>I remember.</i>

31:28.219 --> 31:30.013
You were that girl.

31:30.096 --> 31:31.431
Why didn't you tell me?

31:32.015 --> 31:36.352
You said you started to like perfume
because of the intangible beauty,

31:37.562 --> 31:39.063
but my face is...

31:41.941 --> 31:43.401
You've become much prettier.

31:47.655 --> 31:49.282
Are things better now?

31:49.866 --> 31:51.117
Are you okay?

31:55.455 --> 31:57.916
I thought I'd be okay.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.211
Anyone can tell
that I had some work done...

32:04.631 --> 32:07.342
Why do you say that?
You look very pretty now.

32:07.842 --> 32:08.927
You are beautiful.

32:10.637 --> 32:15.266
It's embarrassing to hear that
from such a gorgeous lady like you.

32:19.062 --> 32:19.979
You see,

32:23.358 --> 32:26.110
I think my life could've been much easier

32:27.236 --> 32:30.657
had I been born less pretty.

32:36.579 --> 32:38.414
Did that sound obnoxious?

32:38.581 --> 32:41.709
No, not at all.
I'm just not following.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.340
I liked it when I was young

32:47.674 --> 32:49.592
because everyone said I looked pretty.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.804
-That's Hye-sung.
-Isn't she pretty?

32:52.887 --> 32:55.264
The prettiest girl in our school.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.016
Not just in our school.

32:57.100 --> 33:00.061
-She's the prettiest in our town.
-Why are you so pretty?

33:00.144 --> 33:02.021
My gosh, she's really stunning.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.147
I know...

33:03.231 --> 33:07.276
<i>Girls envying me and guys being nice to me</i>

33:07.360 --> 33:09.362
<i>were just something I was used to</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

33:10.905 --> 33:12.532
<i>There's this saying, you know.</i>

33:13.074 --> 33:16.035
<i>"A beautiful woman is like someone</i>
<i>who passed the 3 major national exams."</i>

33:17.954 --> 33:20.415
<i>Beauty certainly gives women power.</i>

33:20.873 --> 33:22.792
<i>People respect you wherever you go.</i>

33:23.584 --> 33:24.585
Hye-sung.

33:28.756 --> 33:32.844
<i>And that's why I thought</i>
<i>the world would be my oyster.</i>

33:34.303 --> 33:37.890
<i>I was confident that I'd succeed</i>
<i>in both my career and love.</i>

33:38.683 --> 33:39.809
Ms. Na,

33:40.601 --> 33:42.395
do you have a boyfriend?

33:42.895 --> 33:43.980
She must have many.

33:44.063 --> 33:46.607
Guys are lining up to get a date with her.

33:46.691 --> 33:50.445
I know a very competent young man.
He's from a great family as well.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.487
What do you say?

33:55.366 --> 33:59.370
<i>My husband had the best qualifications</i>
<i>out of all the guys I had dated,</i>

33:59.454 --> 34:01.330
<i>and his family was rich and powerful.</i>

34:01.581 --> 34:04.292
<i>My parents were fond of him as well.</i>

34:06.294 --> 34:08.254
If women are flowers,

34:08.588 --> 34:11.674
you are the most beautiful flower...

34:12.341 --> 34:14.010
I've ever seen.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.098
<i>"A beautiful flower".</i>

34:20.266 --> 34:24.645
<i>Back then, I had no idea that those words</i>
<i>would end up shackling me down.</i>

34:31.652 --> 34:35.739
So did you have to quit your job
back then?

34:37.324 --> 34:38.493
Yes, I did.

34:39.827 --> 34:43.456
It was very hard for me
to get to where I am now.

34:44.791 --> 34:45.875
I see.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.003
I was wrong, too.

34:49.087 --> 34:53.091
When people complimented my looks,
I thought they respected me.

34:54.801 --> 34:58.721
I thought that I should be
able to have my way with any man.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.016
I was foolish.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.565
So you should try to date many guys.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.985
And choose your husband wisely.

35:13.820 --> 35:14.779
Got it?

35:17.323 --> 35:18.449
Yes.

35:21.035 --> 35:23.538
Jung-yeob, give us some sausages.

35:23.996 --> 35:25.873
Hang on a moment.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.252
What did you say
to make the girls all leave?

35:29.710 --> 35:32.046
Are you seriously asking me that
right now?

35:36.008 --> 35:39.137
Tae-young, what are we going to do
tomorrow without the girls?

35:39.971 --> 35:41.889
We'll just have to do it by ourselves.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.435
<i>Sua, Ji-hyo.</i>
<i>Did the guys text you?</i>

35:46.978 --> 35:50.148
<i>Yes, they asked</i>
<i>if I could make it tomorrow,</i>

35:50.356 --> 35:52.108
<i>but I'm not available.</i>

35:52.483 --> 35:53.860
<i>Me, neither.</i>

35:54.193 --> 35:56.779
<i>We should let them struggle by themselves.</i>

35:57.280 --> 35:59.407
<i>But that's not enough.</i>
<i>I'm still angry.</i>

35:59.490 --> 36:00.575
<i>Should we take revenge?</i>

36:00.658 --> 36:01.909
<i>Let's do that.</i>

36:02.535 --> 36:03.369
<i>How?</i>

36:13.379 --> 36:15.631
Why did you come so late?
Where have you been?

36:15.715 --> 36:17.508
-Well.
-Look at this.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.219
What is it?
Did you take a photo with that rapper?

36:20.303 --> 36:23.431
No, that's not it.
It's something important.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.101
Sua commented on
Yong-cheol's social media page.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.478
Do you see the time?

36:30.813 --> 36:32.899
And he replied to Sua...

36:33.941 --> 36:35.776
two hours later.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.905
That means she contacted him first.

36:41.282 --> 36:45.328
Look. His profile shows
which schools he went to.

36:45.411 --> 36:46.954
Isn't something weird?

36:49.874 --> 36:53.836
Do you think Sua did this on purpose
to harass you?

36:56.422 --> 36:58.591
Come on. That's absurd.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.323
COMMENTS

37:22.406 --> 37:25.117
YOU LOOK GREAT

37:28.788 --> 37:30.915
MOM

37:35.086 --> 37:36.128
Hi, Mom.

37:36.212 --> 37:38.381
I'm going to your place
to bring some food.

37:38.464 --> 37:39.966
You can go to school.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.010
You don't have class?

37:43.594 --> 37:45.846
Then I'll get to see you today.

37:46.389 --> 37:47.682
She's staying at home today.

37:50.559 --> 37:54.063
Dad's going to go with me.
I can't carry all these by myself.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.571
Welcome.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.657
We already have so much food. Please.

38:04.740 --> 38:07.702
We never got a cake for Mi-rae
after she got into college.

38:07.785 --> 38:10.037
Come here and help me pick a cake.

38:15.876 --> 38:19.213
I want this one.
The pretty one right here, please.

38:19.755 --> 38:20.798
No.

38:21.882 --> 38:23.759
We'll take the biggest one here.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.018
I told you we should drive here.

38:32.351 --> 38:35.896
Take a look around.
There's nowhere to park here.

38:37.523 --> 38:39.483
It's just so heavy. That's all.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.613
Shall I help you carry that?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.325
No, it's okay.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.119
Let me help.
Where are you headed?

38:50.828 --> 38:53.205
We're going way over there.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.124
Way over there?

38:58.294 --> 38:59.879
-My gosh.
-Oh, it's heavy.

39:01.422 --> 39:04.133
-Over there?
-Yes. Thank you.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.302
Thanks.

39:07.386 --> 39:09.013
-Come on.
-Yes.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.478
It's right there.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.104
Oh, okay.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.567
-I'll get you something to drink.
-No.

39:22.151 --> 39:23.402
You should go inside.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.197
-My gosh.
-Thank you.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.074
-Thank you.
-No problem.

39:28.908 --> 39:32.661
My gosh, he's good-looking
and nice at the same time.

39:33.954 --> 39:36.332
I hope we get a son-in-law like him.

39:36.415 --> 39:38.626
Gosh, let's go inside. I'm so tired.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.216
You brought a lot more
than I expected.

39:45.341 --> 39:47.718
Ms. Na, it feels like Thanksgiving.

39:48.844 --> 39:51.013
We should've taken you
to a nice restaurant.

39:51.722 --> 39:54.892
It's our first meal together
since Mi-rae got into college.

39:55.476 --> 39:58.020
Hurry up and eat.
The kids must be starving.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.230
Okay.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.774
You picked the biggest cake.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.613
Thank you, Dad.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.366
Yes, don't mention it.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.326
Hyun-jung must be hungry.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.412
-Let's blow the candle.
-Okay.

40:15.538 --> 40:18.499
Please let these girls have a great time
in college.

40:19.291 --> 40:21.335
1, 2, 3.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.383
Thank you.

40:28.509 --> 40:29.593
Let's eat.

40:31.929 --> 40:32.805
Wait.

40:33.639 --> 40:37.309
You don't have a photo at the entrance
ceremony, so you should take one.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.436
You're right.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.856
If I had a son, I would've made you
become my daughter-in-law.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.941
-Would you?
-Yes.

40:44.525 --> 40:45.484
Go sit over there.

40:45.568 --> 40:46.986
Everyone, gather together.

40:47.486 --> 40:48.446
Come here.

40:48.988 --> 40:52.616
I think you guys should sit on the sofa.
It'll look way better.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.744
Mr. Kang, sit closer to Mi-rae.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.914
-Yes.
-A little closer.

40:59.373 --> 41:00.416
That's nice.

41:00.499 --> 41:02.751
Mr. Kang, I want you to give me
a big smile.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.921
Okay. In 1, 2, 3.

41:06.213 --> 41:07.673
Now, that's a nice photo.

41:07.756 --> 41:09.842
In 1, 2, 3.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.971
Look over here, Mr. Kang.
In 1, 2, 3.

41:16.390 --> 41:17.766
Are you guys having fun?

41:17.850 --> 41:19.685
Let's take a photo.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.981
-Everyone, he's here.
-Hello.

41:24.857 --> 41:26.609
-You're great.
-Thank you.

41:26.692 --> 41:27.568
My goodness.

41:28.110 --> 41:29.987
Hello, everyone.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.531
-We're going to take a photo.
-Okay.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.408
Okay, now.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.160
Ma'am, you must be exhausted.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.204
You should get on his back.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.165
-He's right. Come on.
-Get on his back.

41:41.248 --> 41:42.208
That's nice.

41:42.291 --> 41:44.919
That looks nice.
You are like mother and son.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.463
That looks perfect.
Everyone, smile.

41:47.546 --> 41:50.132
Okay, I'm going to take a photo now.
In 1, 2, 3.

41:50.716 --> 41:54.261
Let's take one more photo.
In 1, 2--

41:56.680 --> 41:57.848
My gosh.

41:58.682 --> 42:01.393
I hope you stay healthy.
I love you, ma'am.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.062
Eat up, everyone.

42:03.145 --> 42:07.233
Enjoy your food.
Thank you, everyone.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.401
Let's go.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.862
I just got a report from my junior.

42:11.946 --> 42:13.656
She hasn't done anything yet.

42:14.698 --> 42:19.119
She met up with a female student.
But they just had ice cream together.

42:22.456 --> 42:26.544
Ms. Na has a very tight schedule, and
he's having trouble following her around.

42:28.420 --> 42:33.634
Instead of wasting his time, he could just
follow Kyung-seok and Kyung Hee.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.306
My goodness.

42:42.142 --> 42:43.727
Do Sang-won!

42:43.811 --> 42:48.399
-Do Sang-won!
-Do Sang-won!

43:31.442 --> 43:33.152
Hurry up and get out here.

43:33.235 --> 43:34.528
-Come on.
-My gosh.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.406
You guys, this is way too much.

43:37.906 --> 43:40.743
-My gosh.
-What is this?

43:40.826 --> 43:41.744
They're muscles.

43:41.827 --> 43:43.829
Do you seriously want to be like this?

43:43.912 --> 43:46.040
You guys should've worked out.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.627
If you took care of your body
and worked out diligently,

43:49.710 --> 43:51.378
you wouldn't need to wear these.

43:51.837 --> 43:53.631
You can wear this instead.

43:53.922 --> 43:55.549
You guys, this is too mean.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.135
Exactly. You're making us look funny.

43:59.053 --> 44:03.015
You should at least look funny. You aren't
good-looking enough to gather people.

44:03.098 --> 44:04.516
Now, give us a funny pose.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.436
-Come on. Don't take a photo.
-Gosh, forget it.

44:07.519 --> 44:08.437
In 1, 2...

44:08.520 --> 44:10.272
-Stop it.
-Don't take that photo.

44:10.356 --> 44:11.774
What are you guys doing?

44:12.524 --> 44:13.525
Woo-young.

44:18.530 --> 44:20.658
You were a mess yesterday,
and again today.

44:21.450 --> 44:24.411
-Who said you could work in that?
-They were being immature.

44:25.120 --> 44:29.083
Well, they kept insisting that only
the pretty girls could serve,

44:29.166 --> 44:30.459
and commenting on our looks.

44:34.963 --> 44:35.798
Explain this.

44:39.718 --> 44:42.930

44:43.013 --> 44:44.973
We decided to order skirts for uniform.

44:45.057 --> 44:47.643
-But they were shorter than--
-Did you agree?

44:47.726 --> 44:50.729
No, they made them wear it.

44:51.438 --> 44:53.399
They didn't care
what the freshmen said.

44:54.233 --> 44:57.361
This is nothing compared to
what they did to us.

44:57.444 --> 44:58.946
Is that why...

45:00.489 --> 45:01.949
Was this your only solution?

45:08.038 --> 45:10.499
How is it that you guys haven't changed
at all?

45:10.582 --> 45:14.253
If you're going to keep pulling this kind
of nonsense, just get rid of it.

45:15.003 --> 45:15.838
I'm sorry.

45:16.922 --> 45:17.965
Sorry.

45:24.972 --> 45:25.889
My gosh.

45:32.354 --> 45:34.857
Just forget about it and let it go.

45:35.441 --> 45:36.650
It's our first festival.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.945
It'll be unfair to let someone like
Park Yong-cheol ruin it.

45:40.028 --> 45:42.197
Shouldn't you be at your booth?

45:42.281 --> 45:43.866
You said you were late.

45:44.366 --> 45:46.201
Where are Yoo Eun and Jung-boon?

45:47.327 --> 45:48.871
They're over there.

45:49.329 --> 45:50.456
Go already.

45:51.457 --> 45:53.709
Make sure you have some real fun, okay?

45:53.792 --> 45:55.419
Okay.

45:55.502 --> 45:56.503
Bye.

45:56.962 --> 45:57.963
Bye.

46:02.134 --> 46:04.344
-Go already.
-Bye.

46:14.938 --> 46:16.064
Mi-rae.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.901
What are you doing alone?

46:20.861 --> 46:23.280
I'm just looking around.

46:24.490 --> 46:27.034
-What about you?
-I'm waiting for Ji-hyo.

46:31.580 --> 46:33.415
I worried a lot about you yesterday.

46:35.250 --> 46:36.168
Are you okay?

46:42.257 --> 46:43.467
By the way,

46:45.177 --> 46:48.180
I went to Yong-cheol's Instagram,

46:49.306 --> 46:53.185
and it said Jaryong Middle School
on his profile.

46:54.311 --> 46:55.395
Didn't you see it?

46:57.940 --> 46:58.816
I don't know.

47:00.943 --> 47:03.570
Did you say you went to that school?

47:03.862 --> 47:05.864
I don't really know the school name.

47:08.116 --> 47:08.951
Is that right?

47:09.034 --> 47:11.453
If I had known,
I would've told you beforehand

47:11.537 --> 47:14.039
that I knew someone
from your middle school.

47:14.206 --> 47:15.207
Don't you think so?

47:18.794 --> 47:20.045
Sua.

47:20.754 --> 47:21.630
Hey.

47:22.881 --> 47:26.468
Surprising news. The guys got scolded
so much by Woo-young just now.

47:26.552 --> 47:27.678
-Really?
-Yes.

47:28.846 --> 47:29.680
Check this out.

47:31.056 --> 47:32.307
Isn't it hilarious?

47:32.391 --> 47:33.976
What's that?

47:34.560 --> 47:36.395
This is even more hilarious.

47:36.478 --> 47:38.230
-Check this out.
-Oh, my.

47:39.481 --> 47:40.315
Goodness.

47:42.818 --> 47:44.027
There's this one, too.

48:01.169 --> 48:02.838
Are you still down?

48:06.633 --> 48:08.051
Did you get scolded a lot?

48:08.927 --> 48:09.761
Yes.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.347
What we did was wrong.

48:12.931 --> 48:14.474
-Don't say that.
-It was wrong.

48:14.558 --> 48:17.769
Woo-young never scolds innocent people.

48:26.069 --> 48:29.156
I feel better
whenever I eat something sweet.

48:35.537 --> 48:36.622
Thanks.

48:36.705 --> 48:38.206
You're the best, though.

48:40.083 --> 48:40.918
What?

48:42.044 --> 48:43.503
Among the guys.

48:47.466 --> 48:49.426
Let's go out. It's festival time.

48:50.093 --> 48:51.053
Okay.

48:56.016 --> 48:56.934
What?

48:58.352 --> 48:59.186
It won't open.

49:04.900 --> 49:06.026
What's wrong?

49:10.781 --> 49:11.698
Excuse me.

49:11.782 --> 49:14.743
The door won't open,
so could you try opening it?

49:17.329 --> 49:18.163
Thank you.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.583
What's wrong with it? Tae-hee, come out.

49:28.048 --> 49:29.007
Open the door.

49:30.509 --> 49:31.718
It's working.

49:31.802 --> 49:32.928
What's wrong with it?

49:33.011 --> 49:35.138
-Maybe it's broken.
-When did it break?

49:38.475 --> 49:42.062
It's not fun to be with just girls.
Please don't do that.

49:42.145 --> 49:43.438
Do you have boyfriends?

49:44.147 --> 49:47.025
It's best if you're single,
but it's okay if you're taken.

49:47.109 --> 49:49.778
Give me just 10 minutes for this game.

49:49.861 --> 49:51.071
Please come this way.

49:51.154 --> 49:53.448
-What is it?
-Come, come.

49:55.492 --> 49:58.787
Come this way. How pretty.

49:58.870 --> 50:02.207
Please move inside.

50:02.290 --> 50:03.667
Have a seat.

50:03.750 --> 50:07.754
All right. Gosh, you guys are lucky.

50:08.255 --> 50:11.049
You've met the prettiest girls
in our school.

50:11.133 --> 50:14.136
-Hello.
-Hello.

50:14.219 --> 50:18.640
Please hold for a second.
I'll go bring one more guy.

50:21.560 --> 50:24.646
I'm dazed because we got dragged here
all of a sudden.

50:24.730 --> 50:26.064
-Us, too.
-It's the same.

50:28.066 --> 50:29.568
Anyone want a blind date?

50:29.651 --> 50:31.361
Huh? Kyung-seok?

50:34.573 --> 50:36.116
What should we do?

50:39.202 --> 50:43.040
Gosh. When did he come take a seat?

50:44.249 --> 50:47.210
You're so handsome.
I should come to my senses.

50:47.294 --> 50:50.589
All right, guys.
Now that we have even numbers,

50:50.672 --> 50:55.844
You can have conversation for 10 minutes .
You'll partner up with someone you like.

50:55.927 --> 50:57.095
Can't we point out?

50:58.513 --> 51:00.932
You sat here
because you have someone in mind.

51:01.016 --> 51:05.103
Okay, who on earth is the girl
you have in mind?

51:09.149 --> 51:10.067
Her.

51:13.904 --> 51:17.866
If she says yes, they will be
the fastest couple created ever.

51:17.949 --> 51:21.203
Will it become a group blind date
among four people?

51:21.286 --> 51:24.414
Let's hear how she feels.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.725
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

51:45.143 --> 51:47.145
-I'm okay.
-You're all wet.

51:47.395 --> 51:48.355
What should we do?

51:48.980 --> 51:51.566
There must be extra t-shirts
in our department room.

51:52.609 --> 51:53.610
Really?

51:53.944 --> 51:56.321
Then I'll go first.

51:57.739 --> 51:59.366
-I'll go with you
-I'll go with you.

52:13.672 --> 52:15.549
I'll go with Kyung-seok.

52:21.138 --> 52:21.972
Let's go.

52:24.933 --> 52:28.145
Anyway, they've become a couple.

52:28.436 --> 52:30.438
Excuse me. Take the prize.

52:30.522 --> 52:31.356
Excuse me.

52:45.704 --> 52:47.789
-You want to run?
-What?

52:49.749 --> 52:51.418
If it's embarrassing, let's run.

52:57.424 --> 52:58.341
Okay.

53:06.183 --> 53:09.936
Don't try to calculate love
not to get hurt.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.397
That'll only make you suffer even more.

53:13.106 --> 53:15.233
-Okay.
-Good luck.

53:16.067 --> 53:16.985
Thank you.

53:17.068 --> 53:19.196
-You can do it.
-I can do it!

53:19.279 --> 53:20.530
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

53:27.287 --> 53:29.247
Hey, Woo-young.

53:30.373 --> 53:32.667
Awesome. We should've done this stuff.

53:32.751 --> 53:35.045
Not everyone can do this, you know.

53:36.588 --> 53:37.839
Can you read my fortune?

53:37.923 --> 53:39.341
Sure. Have a seat.

53:42.928 --> 53:45.055
Okay, choose one of these.

53:49.643 --> 53:50.810
I'll choose this one.

53:51.561 --> 53:54.022
Huh? This is unexpected.

53:54.105 --> 53:57.567
I thought you'd choose this one.

53:58.276 --> 54:00.737
I know well about the future I want.

54:00.820 --> 54:02.364
I see.

54:02.948 --> 54:05.659
All right.
I'll start the psychological test now.

54:06.618 --> 54:09.788
Let's say you went to buy
a cozy knitted sweater.

54:09.871 --> 54:13.375
Choose what kind of sweater
you'd buy among four options.

54:13.458 --> 54:14.834
-Okay.
-The first one is

54:14.918 --> 54:16.920
a sweater with a big highlight pattern.

54:17.754 --> 54:20.840
-The second one is a striped sweater.
-A sweater with stripes.

54:20.924 --> 54:25.095
The third one is a plain sweater
in a bold color such as red or blue.

54:25.178 --> 54:30.016
The fourth one is a plain sweater,
such as gray or black.

54:30.642 --> 54:31.893
Gray or black...

54:35.230 --> 54:37.440
-I'll go with the third one.
-The third one?

54:38.191 --> 54:41.319
That means you want simple love.

54:41.820 --> 54:45.824
You prefer an uncomplicated love
to an extremely passionate one.

54:47.325 --> 54:50.662
You can keep your emotions in check
no matter how you feel.

54:51.204 --> 54:52.622
It's pretty accurate.

54:54.249 --> 54:59.462
It can look graceful,
but on the other hand,

54:59.546 --> 55:03.091
your love may be seen as hypocritical
as well.

55:03.174 --> 55:04.009
Hypocritical?

55:05.051 --> 55:07.470
You should try to be honest
with your feelings.

55:07.554 --> 55:10.974
When you're not honest with yourself,
you can't win someone's heart.

55:11.850 --> 55:12.809
I'm very honest...

55:16.771 --> 55:18.565
Right, I've been careful.

55:19.733 --> 55:20.692
Why?

55:23.403 --> 55:24.362
It's a secret.

55:25.196 --> 55:27.449
Your secret will be safe with me.

55:30.827 --> 55:32.537
She's a student in our department.

55:38.084 --> 55:39.878
You mean, the chemistry department?

55:43.673 --> 55:45.133
I see.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.805
-Are we done, then?
-Yes.

55:51.473 --> 55:53.058
Thanks. I'll see you around.

55:53.141 --> 55:55.101
Okay. Bye.

56:27.133 --> 56:28.885
-My gosh.
-There it is.

56:30.011 --> 56:31.179
Did you find it?

56:34.516 --> 56:36.393
-Here.
-Thanks.

56:36.476 --> 56:37.685
I'll wait outside.

56:42.774 --> 56:43.608
What's going on?

56:45.735 --> 56:46.569
What's wrong?

56:49.531 --> 56:51.032
You can't open it?

56:53.034 --> 56:53.868
Let me try.

57:06.631 --> 57:07.632
Hello?

57:10.135 --> 57:11.803
Anybody outside?

57:30.822 --> 57:32.323
Why isn't she picking up?

57:32.866 --> 57:34.534
You should try calling other people.

57:35.493 --> 57:36.661
I don't have my phone.

57:37.745 --> 57:38.580
What?

57:39.164 --> 57:40.582
Everyone is ready, right?

57:40.665 --> 57:44.169
Then here we go. 1, 2, 3!

57:48.339 --> 57:51.885
Sadly, we don't have a match.

57:52.343 --> 57:54.804
-Then I can leave, right?
-Yes, you can leave.

58:05.690 --> 58:06.983
Whose phone is this?

58:07.650 --> 58:09.444
-It's not mine.
-It's not mine.

58:10.236 --> 58:12.572
It must be Kyung-seok's.
You can give it to me.

58:13.114 --> 58:13.948
Okay.

58:15.408 --> 58:16.242
KANG MI-RAE

58:16.326 --> 58:17.368
1 MISSED CALL

58:22.540 --> 58:26.044
<i>The person you're trying to reach is</i>
<i>unavailable. Please leave...</i>

58:27.462 --> 58:28.713
No one's picking up.

58:29.631 --> 58:30.548
I guess I lost it.

58:32.717 --> 58:35.261
Eun isn't answering.
Jung-boon isn't either.

58:36.221 --> 58:37.555
Who else can we call?

58:39.432 --> 58:41.643
Shall I try calling Sua and Ji-hyo?

58:43.978 --> 58:44.854
Forget it.

58:46.981 --> 58:49.108
-Just get changed first.
-What?

58:49.192 --> 58:51.110
Or are you going to wait until it dries?

58:59.744 --> 59:01.996
What's going on
between Kyung-seok and Mi-rae?

59:02.914 --> 59:04.207
Could they be...

59:05.792 --> 59:07.710
No, no way. That can't be.

59:09.587 --> 59:12.507
Is Kyung-seok trying to make you jealous?

59:13.633 --> 59:15.593
I don't know what you're trying to say.

59:17.053 --> 59:18.429
That must be it.

59:18.638 --> 59:21.307
Come on. Are you playing hard to get?

59:24.269 --> 59:25.687
What are you talking about?

59:27.146 --> 59:29.482
Do you think I have a crush on him?

59:44.122 --> 59:46.708
-I won't look.
-You shouldn't, of course.

1:00:05.518 --> 1:00:06.394
Are you done?

1:00:07.186 --> 1:00:09.272
I'm not done.
I haven't even taken off...

1:00:15.653 --> 1:00:16.946
Tell me when you're done.

1:01:09.999 --> 1:01:12.960
-You were here together?
-What's going on between them?

1:01:13.044 --> 1:01:15.129
<i>Kyung-seok's father was a congressman.</i>

1:01:15.213 --> 1:01:18.299
-You dropped this yesterday.
-You're really the worst.

1:01:18.383 --> 1:01:21.803
-Ms. Na's in the emergency room.
<i>-In the emergency room?</i>

1:01:21.886 --> 1:01:24.013
Sua, didn't you say
you live in Dogok?

1:01:24.097 --> 1:01:26.307
I moved out of my parents' place.

1:01:26.391 --> 1:01:28.351
-Kyung-seok.
-I'm sorry I misjudged you.

1:01:28.434 --> 1:01:31.396
You would've kept misjudging me
if it weren't for Ji-hyo.

1:01:31.479 --> 1:01:32.647
Yes, Woo-young.

1:01:32.730 --> 1:01:34.899
I'll have a party on Saturday.
Can you come?

1:01:34.982 --> 1:01:36.150
You'll be home late?

1:01:36.234 --> 1:01:37.610
<i>A movie with Kyung-seok.</i>

1:01:37.735 --> 1:01:39.237
<i>This is driving me crazy.</i>
