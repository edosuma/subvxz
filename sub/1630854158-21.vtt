WEBVTT

00:03.729 --> 00:06.672
(humming happily)

00:06.674 --> 00:09.066
Oh Krusty-o, oh Krusty-o,

00:09.068 --> 00:11.677
wherefore art thou, Krusty-o?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.828
Yo, yo, Julie-ech.

00:13.830 --> 00:17.090
To pie or not to pie?

00:17.092 --> 00:19.259
That is no question!

00:19.261 --> 00:20.627
(laughs)

00:20.629 --> 00:24.690
(crickets chirping)

00:24.692 --> 00:26.358
Well, the crickets get it,

00:26.360 --> 00:28.343
and they're the toughest
insects to please.

00:28.345 --> 00:30.512
But what happened
to my audience?

00:30.514 --> 00:31.513
(snores)

00:31.515 --> 00:34.199
This is supposed
to be a kids' show.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.110
Sorry, Krusty. Kids
are no longer into your show.

00:37.112 --> 00:39.096
Yeah, kids prefer
TikTok, Instagram,

00:39.098 --> 00:40.781
going to church,
dentist appointments,

00:40.783 --> 00:42.432
even getting bullied.

00:42.434 --> 00:44.359
The only way
we can get an audience

00:44.361 --> 00:46.694
is to bring in loose seniors
who are lost at the mall.

00:46.696 --> 00:48.363
We were lied to.

00:48.365 --> 00:50.774
We were promised
air conditioning.

00:50.776 --> 00:52.626
There is air conditioning.

00:52.628 --> 00:54.444
Turn it down! I'm freezing!

00:54.446 --> 00:56.722
Okay, so maybe I did lose touch

00:56.724 --> 00:58.223
with my audience in the '90s.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.726
-What year is this?
-(whispers)

01:00.728 --> 01:02.561
2000 and what?!

01:02.563 --> 01:04.638
I need new material.
Where are my writers?

01:04.640 --> 01:07.232
(whispers)

01:07.234 --> 01:09.476
They're buried where?!

01:09.478 --> 01:10.360
(groans)

01:11.721 --> 01:13.072
I tell you, Krusty,

01:13.074 --> 01:15.816
the heyday of
the TV clown ended

01:15.818 --> 01:17.892
when parents
found out that Ovaltine

01:17.894 --> 01:21.305
was just sugared mud. (laughs)

01:21.307 --> 01:22.897
Everyone's gotten out.

01:22.899 --> 01:24.399
Oingo, Boingo,

01:24.401 --> 01:26.827
Penny Nickels, Knick Knack,
Paddywhack,

01:26.829 --> 01:28.312
the cast of<i> The View,</i>

01:28.314 --> 01:30.738
Dungaree Dave, Sadsy.

01:30.740 --> 01:32.791
Sad to see Sadsy go.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.985
Oh, not Leaky Pants.

01:34.987 --> 01:37.321
He'd never quit.
He was born to it.

01:37.323 --> 01:40.324
When his mother's water broke,
it was seltzer.

01:40.326 --> 01:41.658
Cheese for your scampi?

01:41.660 --> 01:43.602
Leaky? No!

01:43.604 --> 01:46.605
Also, can I buy all
your material for $7,800?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.832
No way.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.517
Fine, I'll just steal it.

01:50.519 --> 01:53.779
Little Debbie Dimples,
you're the wisest of us all.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.172
What do we do?!

01:55.174 --> 01:56.523
I don't know.

01:56.525 --> 01:59.860
I'm as cute and
adorable as I ever was.

01:59.862 --> 02:01.862
Check out my trademark pout.

02:01.864 --> 02:03.347
(forced laugh)

02:03.349 --> 02:06.533
Oh, it hurts so much to do that.

02:06.535 --> 02:08.544
(hacking coughs)

02:10.022 --> 02:13.114
What we need is
new, young clowns.

02:13.116 --> 02:16.451
But who's teaching 'em? Nobody.

02:16.453 --> 02:19.396
Wait a minute. If I started
a school for clowns,

02:19.398 --> 02:21.122
I could save our profession.

02:21.124 --> 02:22.532
But would I make money?

02:22.534 --> 02:24.959
What's private school
tuition these days?

02:24.961 --> 02:26.562
(whispering)

02:27.464 --> 02:29.797
Yow!

02:29.799 --> 02:32.376
Yeah, hey, you could sell
the students comedy props.

02:32.378 --> 02:36.321
Like those dollar sign contacts
you're wearing. (chuckles)

02:36.323 --> 02:37.714
It's not a prop.

02:37.716 --> 02:39.849
It's scarring from
a drive-through LASIK's clinic.

02:39.851 --> 02:43.053
Little tip: Put the car in park.

02:43.055 --> 02:46.832
Dimples, this
school idea is genius.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.392
Any more advice?

02:48.394 --> 02:51.912
Yes. The most important
thing in comedy is...

02:51.914 --> 02:53.005
is...

02:53.007 --> 02:55.732
uh, um...

02:55.734 --> 02:57.009
What? What?!

02:57.011 --> 02:59.011
Fine, don't tell me.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.679
What is it?
What could it be?

03:00.681 --> 03:02.830
Why won't she tell me?

03:02.832 --> 03:04.016
Is it being funny?

03:04.018 --> 03:05.909
Is it big shoes? What?

03:05.911 --> 03:06.760
Now, listen here, Bozo,

03:06.762 --> 03:09.170
you can't just open a school

03:09.172 --> 03:10.430
and expect to be certified.

03:10.432 --> 03:13.692
That's right, you need
psychological evaluations,

03:13.694 --> 03:15.194
educational degrees.

03:15.196 --> 03:18.755
I think you'll find
every document you need

03:18.757 --> 03:20.515
in this envelope.

03:20.517 --> 03:23.427
No cash.
Now I only take Griftr.

03:23.429 --> 03:24.611
See?

03:24.613 --> 03:27.188
Now, about the curriculum.
Will you teach STEM?

03:27.190 --> 03:31.192
Sure will. Slapstick, tumbling,
enormous shoes and mime.

03:31.194 --> 03:33.212
Mime?! Yeah, forget it.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.439
Hey, that's great.

03:35.441 --> 03:37.382
Would you like to teach
mime at my school?

03:38.126 --> 03:39.701
You've got the job.

03:39.703 --> 03:40.944
Sign here. Oh, no.

03:40.946 --> 03:43.129
The wind blew the papers away.

03:43.131 --> 03:46.058
Oh, catch them and put
them in your magic box.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.480
(shoes squeaking)

03:53.234 --> 03:55.976
Clowning is now
the most despised profession

03:55.978 --> 03:59.129
in America after
Supreme Court justice.

03:59.131 --> 04:00.814
But that will change.

04:00.816 --> 04:03.224
We will lift
our clown horns high

04:03.226 --> 04:07.471
and tell the world,
"Agagabawoogakazowie!"

04:07.473 --> 04:08.914
(horns honk)

04:08.916 --> 04:13.310
Now, let's pull together
as only clowns can.

04:13.312 --> 04:14.753
(hysterical laughing)

04:16.648 --> 04:19.332
Well, whatever the hell
this is, it's starting.

04:19.334 --> 04:20.742
<i> ANNOUNCER:</i>

04:33.999 --> 04:36.108
Teachers. They have it so easy.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.335
They get to buy their own
classroom equipment,

04:38.337 --> 04:40.353
and people tell them what
they can and can't teach.

04:40.355 --> 04:41.763
What a racket.

You're doing just fine
at Springfield Elementary.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.223
No, I'm not. In fact,

05:17.225 --> 05:19.133
here are several notes
from my teachers.

05:19.135 --> 05:21.653
(Marge groaning)

05:24.049 --> 05:25.215
This could be the chance for me

05:25.217 --> 05:26.883
to turn my
sucked-up life around.

05:26.885 --> 05:28.810
I'll be like Lisa, but fun.

05:28.812 --> 05:30.812
Hey.

05:30.814 --> 05:32.556
-Mm.
-Objection withdrawn.

05:32.558 --> 05:35.000
Look at it this way, guys.
You got to straighten me out.

05:35.002 --> 05:38.562
It's either this way
or Catholic school.

05:38.564 --> 05:40.005
Catholic school?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.247
(both gasp)

05:41.249 --> 05:44.158
<i> Te deum laudamus:</i>
<i> te dominum confitemur.</i>

Okay, okay, you got it.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.171
Kid, your grades are
nothing to "hey, hey" about,

05:57.173 --> 05:58.932
so sell me on you.

05:58.934 --> 06:02.361
Well, sir, I've been voted
class clown three years running.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.696
Impressive.
I never won anything.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.347
My publicist got me one of those

06:06.349 --> 06:09.926
"In Memoriam" segments once,
but I was alive.

06:09.928 --> 06:13.930
(somber music plays)

06:13.932 --> 06:16.099
It was great
to see my face up there,

06:16.101 --> 06:17.525
although it got booed.

06:17.527 --> 06:19.119
Still, this application has...

06:19.121 --> 06:21.863
What's the educational
term for it?

06:21.865 --> 06:23.382
"The stink of a loser."

06:23.384 --> 06:24.791
Oh, man.

06:24.793 --> 06:26.443
Wait a minute. Now, see here.

06:26.445 --> 06:29.629
Maybe my kid is a loser,
but he's an alpha loser.

06:29.631 --> 06:32.391
The one that all
the other losers blindly follow.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.784
Whatever Bart's joining,
I'm joining.

06:34.786 --> 06:38.063
And I'll pay whatever it takes.
Here are all my pin numbers.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.565
Take them. Come on, take them.

06:42.385 --> 06:45.128
Kid, you've shown me the way.

06:45.130 --> 06:47.981
The bottom of the barrel
is lined with gold.

06:47.983 --> 06:50.742
Now bring me every
rotten apple in the barrel.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.060
Hmm.

06:53.062 --> 06:56.806
Krusty,<i> mein</i> old pal.
Showbiz man hug.

06:56.808 --> 06:58.825
(groaning):
Yeah.

06:58.827 --> 07:01.327
I want to present

07:01.329 --> 07:05.090
I think he would be an excellent
candidate for your<i> akademi.</i>

07:05.092 --> 07:07.317

07:07.319 --> 07:09.002

07:09.004 --> 07:11.321
My son is a special boy,

07:11.323 --> 07:13.098
so special, no decent
school will take him.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.268
But he has a gift
for the comedy, like me.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.103
We Germans have a word for it.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.099
I don't know,
we got a lot of applications.

07:32.101 --> 07:35.178
-(rips check)
-Oh, he's in, all right.

07:35.180 --> 07:37.363
That's Malibu rehab money!

07:37.365 --> 07:39.699
Son, let's get you
some ice cream

07:39.701 --> 07:41.126
and a new Lamborghini.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.702
-Whatever.
-(phone keys clicking)

07:42.704 --> 07:43.795
Holy crap.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.780
I could afford another marriage.

07:45.782 --> 07:47.632
And just in time. (groans)

07:56.051 --> 07:58.143
You see this, Dad?
I'm trying to be

07:58.145 --> 07:59.644
an educator, just like you.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.315
Like all great teachers,
my motivation is money.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.526
If you've got a problem,
give me a sign.

08:08.213 --> 08:09.637
Nothing? Nothing.

08:09.639 --> 08:13.216
That's the most positive
thing you've ever said to me.

08:13.218 --> 08:15.142
I'll take that as, uh,

08:15.144 --> 08:17.721
"I admit to being your father."

08:17.723 --> 08:19.556
Okay, Lisa,

08:19.558 --> 08:21.725
here are your
multicolor note cards.

08:21.727 --> 08:23.484
Bart, your honk horn.

08:23.486 --> 08:25.912
Why do you need this
for English class?

08:25.914 --> 08:27.397
I don't know and I don't care.

08:27.399 --> 08:29.065
Ah-ooga.

08:29.067 --> 08:30.634
(honking horn)

08:31.828 --> 08:33.253
Bart, what have I told you about

08:33.255 --> 08:35.129
riding a unicycle
in the kitchen?

08:35.131 --> 08:36.756
Nothing. It's never come up.

08:36.758 --> 08:38.332
Hmm.

08:39.427 --> 08:43.188
"No turnip tossing,
no unhappy pancake faces."

08:43.190 --> 08:45.190
You know, you're right.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.100
Listen, I don't
want to spoil a party...

08:47.102 --> 08:48.601
-Yes, you do.
-Okay,

08:48.603 --> 08:50.678
but I don't enjoy it.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.696
Again, you do.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.423
Okay, but I feel guilty.

08:53.425 --> 08:55.441
-No, you don't.
-Shut up.

08:55.443 --> 08:56.760
Let me speak.

08:56.762 --> 08:59.112
Are we sure Bart is
going to a real school?

08:59.114 --> 09:00.613
(honks horn)

09:00.615 --> 09:03.208
Lisa, don't
step on his enthusiasm.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.878
This combines a boy's
two most natural desires:

09:06.880 --> 09:08.621
To be with his family

09:08.623 --> 09:11.032
while running away
to join the circus.

09:11.034 --> 09:12.717
Lis, for the first time,

09:12.719 --> 09:14.219
I feel like you do about school.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.555
Can you understand that feeling?

09:16.557 --> 09:18.056
Oh, my God, I can.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.916
You made a difference
in my life,

19:53.918 --> 19:55.359
and that'll never change.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.420
He's right. The boy has learned

19:57.422 --> 19:59.438
that if he gives a damn,
he will succeed.

19:59.440 --> 20:03.759
And that false hope will
carry him a long, long way.

20:03.761 --> 20:05.428
Aw, thanks, but I'm afraid

20:05.430 --> 20:08.097
I'll need more
than that to cheer me up.

20:08.099 --> 20:10.632
Hmm. Want to get some nachos?

20:10.634 --> 20:12.101
Did you say<i> "naches,"</i>

20:12.103 --> 20:14.270
the Yiddish word for
"fatherly pride"?

20:14.272 --> 20:16.363
No, I said "nachos,"
the Mexican word

20:16.365 --> 20:18.123
for cheese-covered chips.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.292
It's a sign from my father.

20:20.294 --> 20:22.628
My father finally has<i> naches.</i>

20:22.630 --> 20:24.797
I said, "nachos."

20:24.799 --> 20:27.374
Chipotle on me.

20:27.376 --> 20:30.394
Timing. The most important
thing is timing.

You children have

21:00.593 --> 21:03.094
<i> you didn't see nothing.</i>

21:03.096 --> 21:04.820
<i> And all further announcements</i>

21:04.822 --> 21:05.763

21:05.765 --> 21:07.098
<i> my uncle's doctor's office</i>

21:07.100 --> 21:08.157
<i> because the Feds</i>

21:08.159 --> 21:09.767

<i> Good day.</i>
