WEBVTT

01:04.230 --> 01:05.398
[Honerva whispering] Allura.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.441
[Allura gasps]

01:08.735 --> 01:10.278
[whispering continues] Allura.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.323
Allura.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.411
Allura.

01:22.373 --> 01:23.875
Allura!

01:23.958 --> 01:25.502
-[gasps]
-[panting]

01:25.585 --> 01:27.712
[Lance] Allura, are you okay?

01:28.546 --> 01:31.132
What's going on? Where am I?

01:31.758 --> 01:33.176
You're in the medical bay.

01:33.676 --> 01:36.513
When we got back from Clear Day,
we found you collapsed on the ground.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.932
You've been asleep for two quintants.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.726
The entity, it's missing.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.311
Did you...?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.440
I did what needed to be done.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.652
-No.
-What needed to be done?

01:50.735 --> 01:52.278
What are you talking about?

01:52.612 --> 01:56.658
This entity, it is connected to Honerva
in some way.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.201
I believe we can use it.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.495
Use it? I...

02:02.288 --> 02:04.666
I swore to your father
that I would look after you,

02:05.291 --> 02:07.168
but I fear I may have let him down.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.004
This is the path of darkness.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.299
It is the path toward defeating Honerva.

02:19.764 --> 02:20.807
You wanted to see me?

02:21.683 --> 02:24.811
We've been working on something,
and we thought we'd run it by you.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.938
We think we might have a way
to find Honerva.

02:31.025 --> 02:33.194
The entity has bonded me to Honerva.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.030
The link is there
whether we utilize it or not.

02:36.114 --> 02:40.660
I believe that if the Paladins connect
using the shared consciousness of Voltron,

02:40.743 --> 02:44.414
we may be able to travel through the void
and into Honerva's mind.

02:44.914 --> 02:48.042
That could, in theory, give us access
to her physical location

02:48.126 --> 02:51.129
as well as key information
on how to defeat her.

02:51.337 --> 02:55.258
Which, after what happened the last time
we faced her, could be super useful.

02:55.341 --> 02:59.888
Honerva is capable of creating
galactic Komars, wormholes, Robeasts.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.181
And now Lotor and his mech
are out there somewhere.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.935
She is the single greatest threat
the universe has ever faced,

03:06.185 --> 03:07.979
and we don't have any other leads.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.105
It might take lifetimes

03:09.188 --> 03:11.316
for another opportunity like this
to come around.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.443
We think this is worth the risk.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.822
I spent a lot of time
in the infinite void.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.576
It took all of my strength
not to lose my sanity.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.747
And if you face Honerva in the void,
she will win.

03:27.123 --> 03:27.957
But...

03:28.708 --> 03:32.503
if you can find a clue
that leads to defeating Honerva and Lotor,

03:32.587 --> 03:34.422
it could give us the upper hand
in this fight.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.300
I don't like the idea
of using Allura like this.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.178
We're messing with powers
we don't fully understand

03:40.261 --> 03:41.888
that have ruined countless lives.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.682
It's... it's dangerous.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.310
Lance, we're the Paladins of Voltron.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.188
There is no one more capable
of taking this on.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.065
It has to be us.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.208
Let's do it.

04:11.084 --> 04:15.046
Besides, the team will have
our sharpshooter there to keep us safe.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.675
I knew that nickname was gonna catch on
one of these days.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.347
It's been a long time since it was only
the seven of us in a room together.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.933
Let's make sure it's not the last.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.145
[Voltron powering up]

04:40.655 --> 04:41.781
[exhales]

04:43.074 --> 04:44.200
[screams]

04:46.911 --> 04:49.414
[grunting, panting]

04:49.497 --> 04:51.082
[Lance] Allura, are you okay?

04:51.457 --> 04:52.542
I'm fine.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.588
It doesn't seem fair
that he won with a robot arm.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.508
Ah, almost everyone had a robot arm.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.760
The last guy had two robot arms.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.475
The Lions are launching.
Put the Atlas on high alert.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.769
Iverson, power up the Atlas' weapons.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.272
Veronica, make sure
the shield system is go.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.899
[Veronica] High alert? What's going on?

05:16.983 --> 05:18.151
We're just being careful.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.029
The Atlas needs to be prepared
for any eventuality.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.415
It is time to begin.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.510
[gasps]

05:47.722 --> 05:51.225
-[Hunk] Now what?
-Allura, do you feel anything?

05:52.226 --> 05:54.437
We must travel through that light!

05:54.604 --> 05:57.899
[Hunk] It looks so far away.
How do you know?

05:57.982 --> 06:00.193
The entity draws me toward it!

06:15.416 --> 06:17.627
[Lance] What is this place?

06:18.252 --> 06:21.672
It's like... it's like I can hear
what the universe is thinking.

06:22.507 --> 06:27.053
Remember how the Olkari told me that
everything is made of the same energy?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.639
I think it has something to do with that.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.724
So, thoughts are linked

06:31.808 --> 06:34.936
across some kind of, what,
cosmic connection?

06:35.770 --> 06:39.315
Yeah, but I think we are the thoughts

06:39.398 --> 06:42.318
inside a network
of other people's thoughts.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.612
Oh, this is making my head hurt.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.031
Yeah, I'm actually with Lance on this one.

06:47.323 --> 06:51.452
-If we are to-- [screams]
-[all screaming]

06:53.579 --> 06:55.289
[grunting]

07:00.461 --> 07:03.548
[Coran] I'm detecting fluctuations
in Voltron's energy signature.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.050
-Should we do anything?
-Hold.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.554
[panting]

07:10.596 --> 07:11.806
What was that?

07:12.598 --> 07:15.017
It felt like cold water
running down my spine.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.478
-That was Honerva.
-What?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.440
The entity inside of me
is connected to her.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.150
Wait, then why did we feel it?

07:22.567 --> 07:25.236
It must be because we're all connected
through Voltron.

07:25.862 --> 07:30.366
Yes. The psychic link between us
is now shared with Honerva.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.953
The closer we are to her,
the stronger that link.

07:34.495 --> 07:36.539
This is too dangerous.

07:36.706 --> 07:40.793
Honerva is gonna use the connection
to find us, to find you.

07:41.043 --> 07:44.881
No, this is how we are going to find her.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.759
But first, I must learn
how to utilize this energy to do so.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.179
[Keith] This isn't just on you now,
Princess.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.181
We're all in this together.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.976
Maybe if we concentrate,
we'll be able to feel her energy.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.353
Then we can track it back to its source.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.814
Let's all focus.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.919
[roaring]

08:36.849 --> 08:39.018
[Hunk] This is awesome!

08:50.363 --> 08:53.783
[Hunk] I can feel something,
like an energy inside me.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.035
It's the entity.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.705
This feeling, it's like...

09:00.331 --> 09:02.667
Like a dark realization washing over.

09:03.751 --> 09:08.005
[Pidge] It's like we're being pulled
by a tether connected to our souls.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.927
We're getting closer.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.105
[electricity crackling]

09:26.857 --> 09:27.692
[Allura] This way.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.646
[electricity crackling]

10:27.043 --> 10:28.836
Is this Honerva's mind?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.964
[Allura] It's on the other side
of this wall.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.967
-[creature shrieks]
-[Allura and Hunk gasp]

10:37.595 --> 10:38.763
What is this?

10:39.722 --> 10:41.015
[Allura] It feels like...

10:41.682 --> 10:47.229
like these are the souls
that Honerva has defeated and corrupted.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.565
It's terrible.

10:54.987 --> 10:59.200
Of course we're gonna have to get
on the other side of the-- What?

11:00.284 --> 11:01.577
-Allura!
-[Hunk grunts]

11:02.828 --> 11:04.789
[all screaming]

11:09.210 --> 11:11.962
[grunting]

11:13.381 --> 11:14.548
Come on!

11:18.052 --> 11:19.220
No!

11:22.431 --> 11:23.474
Come on!

11:24.308 --> 11:26.143
[panting, grunting]

11:34.443 --> 11:37.905
[gasps, pants]

11:39.865 --> 11:40.908
Guys?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.493
Where am I?

11:43.119 --> 11:44.578
Guys, do you copy?

11:45.287 --> 11:46.247
Guys?

11:47.331 --> 11:49.375
Team, can you hear me?

11:51.293 --> 11:53.129
[grunting]

11:56.715 --> 11:58.217
[grunts, groans]

11:58.968 --> 12:00.678
Hello! Anyone?

12:04.932 --> 12:08.060
[yelling]

12:14.900 --> 12:17.695
Team! Something severed our connection!

12:18.279 --> 12:20.698
[yelling]

12:24.326 --> 12:25.703
Paladins, respond!

12:25.786 --> 12:27.037
[grunting]

12:29.206 --> 12:30.708
Why can you not hear me?

12:37.381 --> 12:38.799
[grunts, gasps]

12:41.218 --> 12:44.096
[grunting]

12:45.139 --> 12:46.557
There has to be a way in.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.436
I can't feel them.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.272
I can't even feel my Lion!

12:55.274 --> 12:56.233
[grunts]

13:04.783 --> 13:06.202
[grunts]

13:19.715 --> 13:20.799
Paladins!

13:24.803 --> 13:27.473
I will not let you hurt us any longer!

13:30.309 --> 13:33.729
[shrieks]

13:36.315 --> 13:39.193
[roaring]

13:47.409 --> 13:48.619
[all gasping]

13:49.578 --> 13:51.580
[Allura] This is some kind
of horrible ruse.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.208
And you will pay dearly for it.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.878
-[shrieks]
-[grunts]

14:02.925 --> 14:04.343
Time to end this!

14:05.844 --> 14:07.221
[roaring]

14:12.101 --> 14:13.894
[Alfor] Your suits of armor.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.273
[Trigel] They're incredible.

14:18.065 --> 14:21.277
[Zarkon] We will be a force
to be reckoned with in these armaments.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.321
They stretch, right?

14:25.072 --> 14:27.616
Yes, Gyrgan,
they mold to fit their Paladin.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.369
When will your wonders end, Alfor?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.330
Interesting you should mention that.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.624
I have one more piece of equipment
for all of you.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.502
[beeping]

14:39.962 --> 14:40.921
[Zarkon] What are they?

14:41.505 --> 14:42.965
I call them bayards.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.802
Now, each bayard is crafted
with a small fragment of the comet's ore.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.929
With this much power...

14:50.973 --> 14:53.017
we will be unstoppable.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.482
[Alfor] They can create powerful weapons,

15:00.566 --> 15:04.945
but they can also act as a key bridging
a Paladin's essence with their Lion.

15:06.071 --> 15:09.867
Only so long as we fight together
as a single unit.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.329
To defend the universe.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.831
[all] To defend the universe!

15:23.213 --> 15:24.506
It's really you.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.468
Your soul! Honerva must have...

15:27.551 --> 15:28.969
[Hunk] Trapped you here somehow!

15:29.345 --> 15:31.263
Please, I don't want to fight you!

15:31.764 --> 15:34.558
Please! Remember who you are!

15:36.894 --> 15:38.687
[Allura] Blaytz, please.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.407
[grunts]

15:53.869 --> 15:56.080
[roaring]

15:58.582 --> 16:02.503
[Blaytz grunts]

16:07.549 --> 16:10.010
Make no mistake, Zarkon is coming.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.889
Then we use the Lions,
fight him until our last breath.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.059
I am not certain we can win this fight.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.770
We cannot risk
Voltron falling into his hands.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.733
We will utilize our Lions
to seal the Black Lion.

16:25.192 --> 16:28.153
Once we are done, we will send our Lions
as far away as possible.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.824
Coran, you and the Castle of Lions
will take the Black Lion away.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.827
You would have me leave your side
at the very end?

16:35.661 --> 16:38.789
No. I would have you stand
by my daughter's.

16:39.832 --> 16:40.708
I am entrusting you

16:40.791 --> 16:43.627
with what is most precious to me
in this entire universe, Coran.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.386
It will be my greatest honor.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.180
Then it is decided.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.476
We go into battle together, one last time.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.938
To defend the universe.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.899
[all] To defend the universe.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.949
[Trigel groans]

17:19.163 --> 17:20.122
What...

17:22.499 --> 17:23.375
Where am I?

17:24.626 --> 17:25.711
[Hunk] You're in the void...

17:28.047 --> 17:29.798
just outside of Honerva's mind.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.260
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.141
Are the visions from the Lions true?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.770
Has it really been 10,000 years?

17:43.645 --> 17:44.480
It has.

17:45.731 --> 17:51.570
It saddens me greatly to learn that Zarkon
wreaked such destruction in our absence.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.405
[Hunk] But not completely.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.407
Voltron was reformed.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.078
And the Paladins fly together again.

18:00.204 --> 18:04.333
[Gyrgan] I have always believed
that unity is where true power comes from,

18:04.958 --> 18:08.670
and true unity can only be born of love.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.174
I can't tell you
how much it warms my heart

18:12.257 --> 18:15.177
to know that someone
so connected to the world around her

18:15.260 --> 18:16.845
is piloting the Green Lion.

18:17.638 --> 18:21.725
My race believes observation
to be the most revered attribute.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.103
It is where intelligence is born.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.940
And for you, it is where it has thrived.

18:29.399 --> 18:33.237
The infinite abilities of your mind
dwarf the smallness of your size.

18:33.862 --> 18:36.782
The Green Lion could not have found
a more perfect Paladin.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.996
People often overlooked me
because I was different.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.041
But the Blue Lion recognized
something in me,

18:46.125 --> 18:48.001
something others couldn't see.

18:48.544 --> 18:52.089
It saw the greatness within
that even I did not.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.343
You, Allura,
have greatness within you as well.

18:56.802 --> 19:01.056
You're so much like your father,
and yet so different.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.851
You're a remarkable person.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.979
Thank you for saving us.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.942
[Alfor] Through the Lion's bond,
I could feel your love for my daughter.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.194
[Lance] I could feel yours as well.

19:15.237 --> 19:19.032
As Paladins, we face many quests
throughout the cosmos,

19:19.408 --> 19:22.077
but the most amazing journey
is that of life.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.497
And the biggest question you face
is who to go on that journey with.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.001
I'm glad my daughter chose you.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.803
[Keith panting]

19:41.430 --> 19:42.556
[grunts]

19:43.557 --> 19:44.391
Please.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.228
[grunts, pants]

19:48.312 --> 19:51.440
[Lion roaring]

19:57.070 --> 19:58.030
You're back.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.323
[Lions roaring]

20:21.762 --> 20:22.888
You guys are all right.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.892
Wait, are they the...

20:27.184 --> 20:29.603
Yep, the original Paladins.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.230
Allura!

20:38.320 --> 20:42.115
It is fitting that I would find
what is brightest to me

20:42.199 --> 20:43.951
in the darkest place.

20:44.785 --> 20:48.497
All that I have done,
I have done to make you proud.

20:49.873 --> 20:52.251
Their souls were trapped
by Honerva's dark magic.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.961
When we came near
Honerva's consciousness,

20:54.044 --> 20:55.963
our connection attracted them to us.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.297
Crazy, right?

20:57.798 --> 20:59.675
But we used that connection to free them.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.470
The Lions created a bridge,
sharing old memories with new.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.348
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[all grunt]

21:09.601 --> 21:11.770
-[groaning]
-What's going on?

21:11.979 --> 21:13.730
Honerva's connection grows.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.774
We are very close to her now.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.443
You hold a dark entity within you.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.654
Don't you know how dangerous that is?

21:21.071 --> 21:23.448
That's what led to Honerva
and Zarkon's end.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.950
I know the danger.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.288
But now I have the power to stop Honerva.

21:29.871 --> 21:33.625
You had to make a difficult choice in war
by sending the Lions away.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.586
I also had to make a difficult choice.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.342
I'm not going to be afraid
to use the power I have.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.310
We need to continue.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.979
[Lance] But how do we get past the wall?

21:54.354 --> 21:57.733
[Allura] It's... it's like I can feel
her thoughts.

21:58.608 --> 22:02.029
The way through is with the darkness.

22:03.030 --> 22:07.159
Honerva went mad,
obsessed with darkness and power.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.996
And now we must enter her mind.
