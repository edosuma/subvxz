<i>Previously on
"The Company You Keep"...</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:04.452
Do you want to
get out of here?

00:04.590 --> 00:05.660
Absolutely.

00:07.731 --> 00:09.457
U.S. Senate, huh?

00:09.595 --> 00:11.770
Yeah, he's running
for my dad's old seat.

00:11.908 --> 00:13.806
You owe us
the 10 million you stole

00:13.944 --> 00:15.429
plus an additional 5.

00:15.567 --> 00:17.362
- Is that...
- The bug we planted.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.639
We have a minute to give?

00:18.777 --> 00:20.020
Don't worry about it.

00:20.158 --> 00:21.607
It's early stage memory loss.
That's it.

00:21.745 --> 00:24.127
I'm not getting myself
or my family picked up

00:24.265 --> 00:26.543
just to make good
on your payment schedule.

00:26.681 --> 00:29.857
Try explaining that to
Patrick Maguire's son Connor,

00:29.995 --> 00:32.273
the guy whose father is
now locked up, thanks to you.

00:32.411 --> 00:33.964
Now do you believe
I have what it takes

00:34.103 --> 00:35.518
to run this organization?

00:35.656 --> 00:36.795
She's his daughter.

00:36.933 --> 00:39.901
Daphne is
Patrick McGuire's daughter.

00:43.629 --> 00:45.355
- Oh!
- No, I'm not going up!

00:50.119 --> 00:51.016
Oh!

00:54.364 --> 00:55.676
Man, how are you going to
let me keep draining

00:55.814 --> 00:57.471
that one on you like that, huh?

00:57.609 --> 00:58.955
You seem good,
all things considered.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.715
Yeah, I started
seeing someone.

01:00.853 --> 01:03.718
<i>♪ I've been looking
for the kind of diamond... ♪</i>

01:03.856 --> 01:05.203
<i>Time out, time out,
time out.</i>

01:05.341 --> 01:07.170
I've been beating your ass
for the last hour,

01:07.308 --> 01:08.482
and you just
dropped that on me?

01:08.620 --> 01:09.862
Bruh.
You're up.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.243
All right, you want me
to play for real?

01:11.381 --> 01:12.382
- Wanna do it?
- Let me show you.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.487
- Yeah.
- Oh!

01:15.144 --> 01:16.041
Got 'em.

01:16.179 --> 01:17.215
Oh!

01:19.286 --> 01:20.563
Did you meet on
a dating app or--

01:20.701 --> 01:22.737
Hotel bar.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.085
How do you always manage
to keep it old-school, huh?

01:25.223 --> 01:27.432
<i>What's she like?</i>

01:27.570 --> 01:29.503
Ah, she's smart--

01:29.641 --> 01:34.266

beautiful, funny,

01:34.404 --> 01:36.026
<i>complicated, but like in
the best way, you know?</i>

01:39.409 --> 01:41.687
I mean, my dad's starting
to slip a little bit.

01:41.825 --> 01:43.689
That sounds brutal.

01:43.827 --> 01:45.622
Yeah, it is.

I don't know.

02:07.851 --> 02:10.820
I mean, can you be in love
with someone you're lying to?

02:10.958 --> 02:12.408
Maybe the better
question is,

02:12.546 --> 02:15.031
why are you lying
to somebody you love?

02:17.413 --> 02:18.897
This woman--there's
no way she'd stick around

02:19.035 --> 02:20.830
if she knew the truth.

02:21.796 --> 02:23.729
People can surprise you.

02:31.427 --> 02:33.877
Brown sugar and cinnamon?

02:34.015 --> 02:36.156
You're going to love it.

02:43.991 --> 02:47.063
Hey, do all your guests
go out the back door,

02:47.201 --> 02:48.685
or am I special?

02:48.823 --> 02:50.411
I live next to my sister
and niece

02:50.549 --> 02:52.448
above the bar
that I own with my family.

02:52.586 --> 02:54.346
So you're more than welcome
to go out the front door

02:54.484 --> 02:55.727
and bump into them
in the hallway.

02:55.865 --> 02:56.797
Hmm.

02:58.799 --> 02:59.696
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

02:59.834 --> 03:00.697
- Hmm.
- Mm.

03:00.835 --> 03:02.216
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

03:11.674 --> 03:13.434
You must be Ollie.

03:20.786 --> 03:23.720
Is Emma.

03:28.484 --> 03:29.416
Uh--

03:40.496 --> 03:43.119
OK, I think.

03:47.296 --> 03:48.918
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:52.853 --> 03:56.305
Ho ho, Simon.

03:56.443 --> 03:57.823
Yeah, he started
calling last week.

03:57.961 --> 03:59.653
I don't know why.
I don't need to know why.

03:59.791 --> 04:00.861
You can decline.

04:00.999 --> 04:02.172
At least he's trying.

04:02.311 --> 04:03.898
Yeah. He is.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.694
Ten years of parent/teacher
conferences short of trying.

04:06.832 --> 04:09.007
But I was thinking
about Daphne.

04:09.145 --> 04:10.422
- Changing subjects?
- Yeah.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.562
If she's Maguire's daughter,

04:12.700 --> 04:14.150
why is she slumming it with us?

04:14.288 --> 04:15.910
I don't know,
but we gotta figure out

04:16.048 --> 04:17.291
what princess is up to.

04:26.852 --> 04:28.268
It's just--

04:32.686 --> 04:34.032
Emma?

04:36.517 --> 04:37.863
I haven't changed
my sheets since Tina left.

04:38.001 --> 04:39.348
You have a new girlfriend?

04:39.486 --> 04:40.866
What do you know about her?

04:41.004 --> 04:42.799
I know that I like her.

04:42.937 --> 04:44.663
Is that really
enough after Tina?

04:47.977 --> 04:49.530
Sorry.

05:00.265 --> 05:01.922
All right?
- Oh, yeah?

05:02.060 --> 05:03.164
Protect who from what?

05:08.618 --> 05:10.068
Oh, that was fast.

05:10.206 --> 05:11.759
That's what I said.

05:11.897 --> 05:13.554
So...

05:18.801 --> 05:21.769
Opens at 8:00,
so let's get going.

05:21.907 --> 05:23.219
- Sorry.
- OK.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.393
No you're not.

05:43.101 --> 05:44.827
Don't worry,
I'll keep an eye on her.

05:44.965 --> 05:47.761
Hey, Bird, I got it.

05:47.899 --> 05:49.314
Just gonna go get some
details from Jones.

05:49.452 --> 05:50.936
Won't be gone very long.

05:51.074 --> 05:52.041
For what it's worth,
I don't love getting

05:52.179 --> 05:53.525
into bed with Jones Malone.

05:53.663 --> 05:55.596
Oh, I never liked that guy.

05:55.734 --> 05:57.943
Even when you guys were
kids, big Gemini energy.

05:58.081 --> 06:00.152
Look, I don't like the guy
either, but unless one of you

06:00.290 --> 06:02.914
has a better play on the table?

06:04.364 --> 06:07.021
OK. I gotta go see a guy
about a horse.

06:32.219 --> 06:34.152
- Hello.
<i>- I think I might've</i>

06:34.290 --> 06:35.809
blown your plan
to keep me a secret.

06:35.947 --> 06:37.500
<i>Yeah, so I hear.</i>

06:37.638 --> 06:40.330
The good news is,
you got Ollie's approval.

06:40.469 --> 06:42.056
The bad news?

06:42.194 --> 06:44.162
Now you gotta
meet the rest of them,

06:44.300 --> 06:46.371
win them all over.

06:46.509 --> 06:48.753
They want you to stop by
our Derby crab feast

06:48.891 --> 06:50.720
tomorrow night--
just, you know,

06:50.858 --> 06:53.413
family,
a couple of dozen regulars--

06:53.551 --> 06:54.931
<i>No pressure.</i>

06:55.069 --> 06:57.658
No, none at all.

06:57.796 --> 07:00.765
Hey, if this is too much,
you know, too fast--

07:00.903 --> 07:03.492
No, no, it's, um...

07:03.630 --> 07:06.011
<i>it's just the right speed.</i>

07:06.149 --> 07:07.910
I'd love to meet your family.

07:08.048 --> 07:09.429
OK, great.

07:09.567 --> 07:11.361
<i>It's a--it's a date.
See ya.</i>

07:11.500 --> 07:13.225
I gotta go
clean ten more stalls,

07:13.363 --> 07:14.606
but it was nice
meeting you, Frank.

07:14.744 --> 07:16.884
- Thank you.
- Frank, huh?

07:17.022 --> 07:18.679
It is today.

07:20.716 --> 07:22.614
You showed up.

07:22.752 --> 07:25.203
Does this mean you're in?

07:25.341 --> 07:26.618
Tell me about the job.

07:26.756 --> 07:28.620
It's right up your alley.

07:28.758 --> 07:31.243
I'm selling a horse I
don't own to a mark so rich

07:31.381 --> 07:32.969
he won't even miss the money.

07:33.107 --> 07:35.800
Then... [blows] I disappear.

07:35.938 --> 07:38.665
So how are you
handling the real owners?

07:38.803 --> 07:40.529
Stable hand just confirmed
they're out of the country

07:40.667 --> 07:42.738
and won't be here
for the big race.

07:42.876 --> 07:44.947
What's the money
looking like?

07:45.085 --> 07:47.674
I've primed her to buy
the horse for a million.

07:47.812 --> 07:49.572
I've done most of the work.
Your cut would be 15.

07:49.710 --> 07:51.298
That's a little light, Jonesy.

07:51.436 --> 07:54.404
Come on, a generous cut
will be 20 to bring it home.

07:54.543 --> 07:55.578
Better.

07:55.716 --> 07:57.062
Who's the target?

07:57.200 --> 07:59.409
Martha Pope.

07:59.548 --> 08:02.896
She's a venture capitalist with
space travel kind of money.

08:03.034 --> 08:05.726
It's a sweet deal.
What do you say?

08:05.864 --> 08:07.038
Frankie.

08:08.349 --> 08:10.006
There she is now.

08:10.144 --> 08:11.939
Were your ears burning, baby?

08:15.633 --> 08:17.117
Can you believe
this beautiful woman

08:17.255 --> 08:19.395
is going to be my wife?
- Oh, stop it.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.672
This is that
legendary horse trainer

08:20.810 --> 08:21.777
I was telling you all about.

08:21.915 --> 08:23.399
Ah.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.711
Pleasure.
Martha Pope.

08:26.436 --> 08:27.576
Buck Calhoun.

08:27.714 --> 08:29.681
Pleasure's all mine, ma'am.

08:32.166 --> 08:33.754
Hey, how was the concert?

08:33.892 --> 08:34.997
Well, I remember
the first half.

08:35.135 --> 08:37.517
- Been there.
- Mm.

08:37.655 --> 08:39.657
Ooh, relationship
status form.

08:39.795 --> 08:40.761
Yes.

08:40.899 --> 08:42.763
I'm filling out the E99.

08:42.901 --> 08:44.972
I'm not going to
overthink this.

08:49.425 --> 08:50.978
Bug.

08:51.116 --> 08:53.291
Hilarious.

08:53.429 --> 08:56.743
Daphne Finch is surprisingly
sassy for a mob lawyer.

08:56.881 --> 08:59.159
Really gave it her all to
make us look like idiots.

08:59.297 --> 09:00.609
Yeah.

09:00.747 --> 09:03.025
Why put on such a big show

09:03.163 --> 09:05.821
when she's just pulling
up stakes and leaving town?

09:07.754 --> 09:09.618
She's trying to get
us off her tail.

09:12.310 --> 09:15.900
Martha Pope founded
her first company at 14,

09:16.038 --> 09:19.938
dropped out of college,
six figures by 21.

09:20.939 --> 09:23.632
She's donated millions
to renewable energy.

09:23.770 --> 09:25.806
Can't believe
that slippery weasel

09:25.944 --> 09:28.360
got this woman
to agree to marry him.

09:28.498 --> 09:31.225
Hey, Charlie, Martha Pope
sounds like a saint.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.986
But cooler.

09:33.124 --> 09:35.367
Yeah, the vibe on this
one is bad, Charlie.

09:35.505 --> 09:37.231
This isn't our
kind of job, son.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.854
I agree.

09:38.992 --> 09:40.338
That's why we're not
going after Martha.

09:40.476 --> 09:42.478
We're gonna take down
the con man.

09:51.867 --> 09:53.523
There she is.

09:53.662 --> 09:55.111
Wow.

09:57.493 --> 09:59.806
So that's what a million
dollar horse looks like.

10:01.566 --> 10:03.395
Kinda looks like
every other horse I've seen,

10:03.533 --> 10:04.431
to be honest.
- Oh, but she isn't.

10:04.569 --> 10:05.984
How are you?
Good to see you.

10:06.122 --> 10:07.365
Hi.

10:07.503 --> 10:08.953
No, she's that
rare breed of female

10:09.091 --> 10:11.024
that dominates the males
at the highest level--

10:11.162 --> 10:13.302
maybe something you might
know a little bit about.

10:14.855 --> 10:16.546
I'd tell you that she
had a sweet temperament,

10:16.685 --> 10:18.203
but I'd be lying.

10:18.341 --> 10:19.722
Well, I'll take winning
over sweet any day.

10:19.860 --> 10:21.724
Now you're talking
her language.

10:21.862 --> 10:24.209
Dad, are you sure about this?

10:24.347 --> 10:25.728
Yeah.

10:25.866 --> 10:27.834
So why are you selling?

10:28.835 --> 10:30.560
She was my wife's horse.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.080
It's time.

10:34.461 --> 10:36.808
I'm so sorry for your loss.

10:36.946 --> 10:40.743
Oh, yeah, his wife
was a wonderful woman,

10:40.881 --> 10:43.263
beautiful inside and out.

10:43.401 --> 10:46.059
She looks nice,
but what's under the hood?

10:46.197 --> 10:47.750
Oh, that's even
better than she looks.

10:47.888 --> 10:49.994
Here, I brought these--
her medical records.

10:50.132 --> 10:54.101
So tell me, how long
have you two been together?

10:54.239 --> 10:57.587
Just a couple of months,
which is crazy, I know.

10:57.726 --> 11:01.177
It's been
such a whirlwind.

11:01.315 --> 11:04.318
But honestly, I can't
remember my life before Frank.

11:04.456 --> 11:08.081
She's more impressive
in person, just like you.

11:08.219 --> 11:09.565
Aw.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.257
Mm.

11:16.261 --> 11:18.678
What do you say, baby?

11:19.748 --> 11:21.577
Let's buy a horse.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.199
Ha!

11:23.337 --> 11:24.614
You made a very smart buy.

11:24.753 --> 11:25.754
Thanks.

11:25.892 --> 11:27.272
I'll need to see the contract.

11:27.410 --> 11:28.757
- Yes, of course.
- I have an idea.

11:28.895 --> 11:31.173
How about you gentlemen
handle the busywork

11:31.311 --> 11:33.416
for a change, and we'll, uh,
we'll celebrate.

11:33.554 --> 11:35.280
Hmm?
Champagne on me.

11:38.076 --> 11:39.802
Yeah...

11:39.940 --> 11:41.528
Be good.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.197
<i>The same bad policies
on crime,</i>

11:55.335 --> 11:57.337
<i>the same failed
health care reform,</i>

11:57.475 --> 11:59.235
<i>the same tax hikes.</i>

11:59.373 --> 12:01.721
<i>You deserve better
than more of the same.</i>

12:01.859 --> 12:05.794
<i>David Hill--
a legacy of failure.</i>

12:05.932 --> 12:07.623
When they go low, we go high.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.452
Thanks, Michelle.

12:09.590 --> 12:10.695
It's still good advice.

12:10.833 --> 12:12.145
It's a good slogan.

12:12.283 --> 12:14.250
Good advice is, they go low,
we raise money.

12:14.388 --> 12:16.494
You, start rolling calls.

12:16.632 --> 12:18.323
You--
- I know, I know.

12:18.461 --> 12:20.325
Save the Chesapeake
charity brunch.

12:21.948 --> 12:23.812
She's right about the calls.

12:23.950 --> 12:25.814
We need money to
spread the message.

12:30.473 --> 12:31.889
Hey, question.

12:32.027 --> 12:33.580
So who's the guy?

12:33.718 --> 12:35.582
I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.066
I mean, you've hardly
been home all week,

12:37.204 --> 12:39.448
and you're doing way
too much smiling.

12:39.586 --> 12:42.244
For a spy, you're not very
good at keeping secrets.

12:42.382 --> 12:43.832
So who is he?

12:43.970 --> 12:46.282
You don't have
that clearance.

12:47.387 --> 12:49.182
<i>Can I get a coffee black?</i>

12:50.735 --> 12:52.012
This one's on me.

12:52.150 --> 12:55.188
What's that I smell?
An agenda?

12:57.397 --> 12:59.364
Come on, sing.
We both know the script.

12:59.502 --> 13:01.056
Our agencies
don't play well together.

13:01.194 --> 13:03.299
The feds shoot first,
ask questions later.

13:03.437 --> 13:04.645
We ask questions first--

13:04.784 --> 13:06.716
Then just keep
asking questions.

13:06.855 --> 13:09.927
$1,000 a kilo?

13:10.065 --> 13:11.721
What's the catch?

13:11.860 --> 13:12.964
No catch.

13:13.102 --> 13:14.483
You go walk
right out that door

13:14.621 --> 13:16.243
and sell it for
five times that?

13:16.381 --> 13:18.383
Why give that kind of
advantage to your competition?

13:18.521 --> 13:20.420
We want the same thing.

13:20.558 --> 13:22.318
Get these drugs off the street.

13:22.456 --> 13:25.632
And arresting Maguire hasn't
changed that flow any has it?

13:25.770 --> 13:27.323
Because I'm looking
to build partnerships

13:27.461 --> 13:29.981
with proven professionals.

13:30.119 --> 13:31.880
You didn't hear it from me,
et cetera, et cetera.

13:32.018 --> 13:34.296
But the streets are flooded.

13:34.434 --> 13:36.677
Everybody is selling
Fenty at a discount.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.231
Losing money doesn't
sound like something

13:38.369 --> 13:39.957
the Maguires would do.

13:40.095 --> 13:41.613
I know.

13:41.751 --> 13:43.581
It's hard to believe,
but maybe you're wrong.

13:43.719 --> 13:45.963
Maybe arresting Papa Maguire
scared them off.

13:46.101 --> 13:48.482
Now they're dumping
their stock.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.658
Next time we get a shipment
and you don't like the price,

13:51.796 --> 13:53.453
you buy from someone else.

13:59.286 --> 14:01.116
You know, I'd actually
given up on marriage,

14:01.254 --> 14:02.842
and then I met Frank.

14:02.980 --> 14:06.673
He was the first man
who wasn't intimidated by me.

14:06.811 --> 14:08.433
We got engaged
three weeks later.

14:09.814 --> 14:11.367
Sounds like he
really makes you happy.

14:11.505 --> 14:13.128
He does.
He really does.

14:14.129 --> 14:15.993
So I have something
to tell you,

14:16.131 --> 14:18.927
and I'm going to need you
not to go try and kill him.

14:20.342 --> 14:22.068
Your fiancé's a con artist.

14:24.104 --> 14:26.003
His name's not Frank.
It's Jones Malone.

14:26.141 --> 14:27.556
We grew up together,

14:27.694 --> 14:31.491
and he has hired us
to fleece you for your money.

14:33.079 --> 14:35.667
That's not possible.

14:35.805 --> 14:38.153
Let me take a wild guess.

14:38.291 --> 14:39.706
A chance bump in
where you both had

14:39.844 --> 14:42.398
the same unique coffee order?
- OK.

14:42.536 --> 14:44.676
Sparkling conversation with
the same unusual interests?

14:44.814 --> 14:47.887
And then you don't see him
for three weeks--

14:48.025 --> 14:49.992
enough time to have
a couple of boring dates

14:50.130 --> 14:52.201
so that you're so excited
to see him again

14:52.339 --> 14:55.411
that it prompts you
to ask him out.

14:55.549 --> 14:58.449
And then a spontaneous engagement

14:58.587 --> 15:00.485
with his mother's ring,

15:00.623 --> 15:02.384
a mother that he never met,

15:02.522 --> 15:04.593
because tragically,
she died in childbirth.

15:06.836 --> 15:09.563
He has run a version of
this since high school.

15:09.701 --> 15:13.533
He will do this,
and then he will disappear.

15:18.193 --> 15:20.229
Well, Birdie's
certainly taking her time.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.197
Can't rush a mark, Jonesy.

15:22.335 --> 15:24.578
OK, here we go.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.236
I'm not signing anything.
This is a scam.

15:27.374 --> 15:28.582
What?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.930
I may not know horses,

15:31.068 --> 15:34.312
but I can spot unfounded hype
before an IPO.

15:36.487 --> 15:39.835
So I get revenge,
and you get what exactly?

15:39.973 --> 15:41.457
His money.

15:42.665 --> 15:44.046
Seems fair.

15:44.184 --> 15:48.016
We start by using
the truth to sell a lie.

15:48.154 --> 15:50.397
The best way to
test a product's worth

15:50.535 --> 15:51.778
is public valuation.

15:51.916 --> 15:53.469
Yeah.
What do they call that?

15:53.607 --> 15:55.023
Crowd, crowd--
- Crowdsourcing.

15:55.161 --> 15:56.886
Crowdsourcing, yeah.

15:57.025 --> 15:59.096
Tie the sale price of
the horse to the closing odds

15:59.234 --> 16:00.373
before the race.

16:00.511 --> 16:02.306
It's unorthodox,
that's for sure.

16:02.444 --> 16:04.204
- I know.
- I love unorthodox.

16:04.342 --> 16:06.206
Once we have
the new terms,

16:06.344 --> 16:07.759
you're going to name
your price.

16:07.897 --> 16:10.970
Listen, the current odds
on Wicked Swift are 10 to 1.

16:11.108 --> 16:14.663
Numbers remain the same, price
remains the same--$1 million.

16:14.801 --> 16:16.216
OK, but what if they change?

16:16.354 --> 16:18.184
Every point's worth
a quarter million.

16:18.322 --> 16:21.325
So if the odds get worse, we
sell for less than a million?

16:21.463 --> 16:24.845
But if the odds get better,
boss, you'd be making more.

16:26.537 --> 16:27.503
97 to 1.

16:27.641 --> 16:30.437
That's... almost 2 million.

16:30.575 --> 16:32.922
<i>He will be spending
your money in his head,</i>

16:33.061 --> 16:34.303
thrilled at the prospect

16:34.441 --> 16:36.029
of getting even more
than he anticipated.

16:36.167 --> 16:37.893
That's where we prime
him to put his money in.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.170
You're a natural.

16:39.308 --> 16:40.965
My cap is 2 million.

16:41.103 --> 16:43.209
Odds get better than
6 to 1, I'm out.

16:44.624 --> 16:45.694
Works for me.

16:45.832 --> 16:47.247
<i>Once you've hooked him,</i>

16:47.385 --> 16:49.284
leave it to us
to handle the odds.

16:50.768 --> 16:52.252
Do you really
think we can do this?

16:52.390 --> 16:53.943
Con men are the easiest
marks of all,

16:54.082 --> 16:56.222
because they never think
it can happen.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.604
<i>And with an ego like Jones's,
he will never see it coming.</i>

16:59.742 --> 17:01.158
I'm all in.

17:20.418 --> 17:22.041
Connor!

17:22.179 --> 17:24.629
I've got her.

17:24.767 --> 17:26.390
What the hell's
going on over there?

17:26.528 --> 17:28.737
Good morning to you too, Connor.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.187
Your calling is for sure.

17:30.325 --> 17:33.224
Where's my money?

17:33.362 --> 17:35.468
White people don't like
drugs no more, is that it?

17:35.606 --> 17:36.952
Well, circumstances
have changed

17:37.090 --> 17:38.471
since your little fiasco

17:38.609 --> 17:40.369
alerted the feds
to our presence

17:40.507 --> 17:41.750
<i>and left me
without a warehouse.</i>

17:41.888 --> 17:44.166
- You were there.
- It was your deal.

17:44.304 --> 17:45.754
<i>But don't worry,
I figured out a way</i>

17:45.892 --> 17:47.238
<i>to keep the expansion plan
on schedule</i>

17:47.376 --> 17:49.999
without putting
another Maguire behind bars.

17:50.138 --> 17:51.311
<i>Go on then, I'm listening.</i>

17:51.449 --> 17:53.520
You handle your end.
I will handle mine.

17:53.658 --> 17:55.522
<i>Your father trusts me.
So should you.</i>

17:55.660 --> 17:59.008
Trust is for family,
not lawyers.

17:59.147 --> 18:01.114
Make the money right.

18:01.839 --> 18:03.806
Or do I have to come over?

18:05.118 --> 18:07.431
The money will be right.

18:10.365 --> 18:13.022
I assure you, I am no
carbon copy of my father.

18:13.161 --> 18:14.921
I actually disagree
with him on some policy--

18:16.198 --> 18:17.579
Hey there.
<i>- Not interested.</i>

18:17.717 --> 18:19.028
- A vote for David Hill--
<i>- The mailbox is full.</i>

18:19.167 --> 18:20.616
David Hill here.

18:20.754 --> 18:21.997
<i>- Um, no thank you.</i>
- I will disagree--

18:23.550 --> 18:25.069
A vote for David Hill--

18:25.207 --> 18:27.382
A vote for David Hill
isn't a vote for the past,

18:27.520 --> 18:28.866
but for your future.

18:29.004 --> 18:30.039
For your future.

18:30.178 --> 18:31.627
<i>Sorry, but no.</i>

18:34.906 --> 18:37.254
You're clearly off to
a better night than me.

18:37.392 --> 18:38.807
Is this a good
meet-the-parents dress?

18:38.945 --> 18:40.533
Our parents
or normal parents?

18:40.671 --> 18:43.605
Are you saying our
parents aren't normal?

18:43.743 --> 18:45.124
Don't sweat mystery
boyfriend's parents.

18:45.262 --> 18:46.090
You'll be great.

18:46.228 --> 18:47.540
Thanks.

18:47.678 --> 18:49.231
Back to
the grindstone for me.

18:49.369 --> 18:50.646
You'll be great too.

18:59.276 --> 19:00.139
Hey there.

19:00.277 --> 19:01.795
David Hill here.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.452
Who do I have the
pleasure of speaking with?

19:03.590 --> 19:05.385
<i>How are your damage
control calls going?</i>

19:05.523 --> 19:07.180
I wouldn't say
damage control.

19:07.318 --> 19:09.803
I'd say opportunities
to get to know my--

19:09.941 --> 19:12.116
<i>David, this is Claire Fox.</i>

19:12.254 --> 19:14.291
<i>I assume you know who I am.</i>

19:14.429 --> 19:17.190
<i>There's no easy way
to say this,</i>

19:17.328 --> 19:19.917
<i>but at this very moment,
the party's discussing</i>

19:20.055 --> 19:22.299
<i>whether or not they should
pull their support,</i>

19:22.437 --> 19:24.301
<i>focus on closer races--</i>

19:24.439 --> 19:28.132
<i>a devastating career blow for
the son of a beloved senator.</i>

19:28.270 --> 19:29.582
<i>David, I want to help you.</i>

19:29.720 --> 19:31.273
<i>I can ensure
their continued support.</i>

19:32.826 --> 19:34.449
<i>I just texted
your personal cell.</i>

19:34.587 --> 19:38.901
<i>We should talk.
I'm not who you think I am.</i>

19:45.805 --> 19:48.739
OK, the bar has officially
never been this clean.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.431
Nerves much?

19:52.363 --> 19:55.332
We're not exactly a normal
family, Mom, so I just--

19:55.470 --> 19:56.816
I want it to go well.

19:58.266 --> 19:59.267
Don't worry.

19:59.405 --> 20:01.096
We'll be on our best behavior.

20:18.286 --> 20:19.632
Hello again.

20:19.770 --> 20:21.220
She likes your purse.

20:29.158 --> 20:31.091
So what's the status
of the horse job?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.715
You said I'd see my
next payment by Monday.

20:33.853 --> 20:35.475
What's the rush?
It's Saturday.

20:35.613 --> 20:36.683
The money's coming.

20:36.821 --> 20:38.340
Is it?

20:38.478 --> 20:39.962
If you disapprove
of my methods,

20:40.100 --> 20:42.517
maybe you'd prefer Connor's.

20:42.655 --> 20:44.346
Should we give him a call?
- You know what?

20:44.484 --> 20:45.830
You wanna give him a call?
That's cool.

20:45.968 --> 20:48.316
Keep everybody honest
with their payment plan.

20:48.454 --> 20:50.835
You want to use
my phone or yours?

20:53.217 --> 20:56.047
You just keep
delivering every week.

20:56.185 --> 20:57.773
I'll keep Connor at bay.

20:58.912 --> 21:00.431
OK.
Thanks.

21:00.569 --> 21:02.261
OK.

21:06.851 --> 21:09.129
Hey, everything OK?

21:10.855 --> 21:11.891
Yeah.

21:12.029 --> 21:13.375
That was interesting.

21:13.513 --> 21:15.377
Daphne just threatened
to phone Connor

21:15.515 --> 21:17.724
when I called her on her bluff.

21:17.862 --> 21:19.795
Flash of panic.

21:19.933 --> 21:21.176
What do you wanna do
with that?

21:21.314 --> 21:22.557
I don't know.
I'll tell you what.

21:22.695 --> 21:24.075
I don't like the
fact that she thinks

21:24.213 --> 21:25.801
she can just roll in here
any time she wants

21:25.939 --> 21:27.251
like she owns the place.

21:27.389 --> 21:28.942
Was I supposed to
use the fire escape?

21:29.080 --> 21:30.979
Hey, no.
Oh, my God.

21:31.117 --> 21:33.292
No, sorry.
No, not at all.

21:33.430 --> 21:35.052
I was just--my--
- Hey.

21:35.190 --> 21:36.709
You must be Emma.

21:36.847 --> 21:38.573
- This is my mom.
- Hi.

21:38.711 --> 21:40.091
Fran.
Nice to meet you.

21:40.229 --> 21:41.610
- Nice to meet you too.
- These are cool.

21:41.748 --> 21:42.646
Thank you.

21:42.784 --> 21:44.372
Pearl's my birthstone.

21:44.510 --> 21:45.718
Gemini?

21:46.857 --> 21:48.237
But Virgo rising.

21:48.376 --> 21:49.894
Oh, OK.

21:50.032 --> 21:51.068
We're going to get
along just fine.

21:51.206 --> 21:52.380
Great.

21:52.518 --> 21:53.933
Come on in.

21:58.731 --> 22:02.079
That is a bold move,
going straight to the jukebox.

22:02.217 --> 22:04.668
I should tell you,
your entire reputation

22:04.806 --> 22:06.601
hinges on whatever it is
you're about to choose

22:06.739 --> 22:08.948
with these folks.

22:12.469 --> 22:14.091
Not worried.

22:18.198 --> 22:20.304
B12--good choice.

22:20.442 --> 22:22.306
Good choice.

22:22.444 --> 22:23.963
Good choice.

22:26.621 --> 22:28.416
Grub's up, y'all.

22:28.554 --> 22:30.314
Mm, it smells amazing.

22:30.452 --> 22:32.351
Yep, it is.

22:34.905 --> 22:37.148
Hey, don't think
anything of it, OK?

22:37.286 --> 22:39.288
Birdie just tends to
keep her guard up.

22:39.427 --> 22:40.704
Oh, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

22:40.842 --> 22:43.189
- Oh, no?
- No, nothing.

22:43.327 --> 22:44.535
- See that?
- OK.

22:44.673 --> 22:45.709
Beautiful.

22:45.847 --> 22:48.297
Now, you gotta separate--

22:48.436 --> 22:50.265
Hey, Ma, tell Charlie
to put his bib on.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.853
- Why?
- Put his bib on.

22:51.991 --> 22:53.958
Come sit.
You should--

22:54.096 --> 22:55.995
Here we go. Ready?
Gotta take this--

22:56.133 --> 22:57.065
I mean, this was
at the horse track.

22:57.203 --> 22:58.169
This was back
when we were kids.

22:58.307 --> 22:59.101
We were like what?
Nine or ten?

22:59.239 --> 23:00.517
Ten years old or something.

23:00.655 --> 23:03.968
I thought I was so
good at picking horses.

23:04.106 --> 23:05.556
Turns out my father--

23:05.694 --> 23:07.731
he was changing all my
bet slips at the window.

23:07.869 --> 23:09.077
It took him three years.

23:09.215 --> 23:10.458
It took me three years
to figure out

23:10.596 --> 23:11.562
that I was no good at this.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.046
I was horrible.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.738
Hey, I know
how to pick winners.

23:14.876 --> 23:17.050
And I'm so sorry, my son, that
I did not pass that on to you.

23:17.188 --> 23:18.914
That's OK, Pop.

23:19.052 --> 23:20.709
Hey, could you grab me
another couple lagers, please?

23:20.847 --> 23:23.194
Two lagers, yeah.

23:23.332 --> 23:24.989
You were always
good at it, though.

23:25.127 --> 23:27.026
Ah, I was all right.

23:30.339 --> 23:32.169
Here.

23:33.239 --> 23:34.689
Way too many for one to carry.

23:38.900 --> 23:41.385
Turns out my son does
know how to pick a winner.

23:51.568 --> 23:55.192
Impressive. Much better
than the morning after--

23:55.330 --> 23:56.883
whoa!

23:57.021 --> 23:58.782
Whoa, hey!

24:01.370 --> 24:02.786
Excuse me, Ollie.

24:10.069 --> 24:11.933
You said she was great.

24:12.071 --> 24:14.867
You didn't say she was great.

24:17.283 --> 24:19.596
<i>Just heard from an asset
that a tall, very attractive</i>

24:19.734 --> 24:21.598
American woman has been
having sit-downs

24:21.736 --> 24:24.497
with several
of Maguire's local rivals.

24:24.635 --> 24:27.293
Maybe she's trying to get out
of the drug game after all.

24:27.431 --> 24:28.915
If she were just
offloading product,

24:29.053 --> 24:31.608
she wouldn't need to
go to multiple rivals.

24:31.746 --> 24:35.577
It must be some kind of
play, but to what end?

24:35.715 --> 24:37.372
So how's it going over there?

24:37.510 --> 24:39.443
More of a "Meet the Parents"

24:39.581 --> 24:41.134
<i>or a "Meet the Fockers"
situation?</i>

24:41.272 --> 24:44.241
Right now it's more of
a bring it on situation.

24:44.379 --> 24:45.725
<i>Charlie's sister is not a fan.</i>

24:45.863 --> 24:47.278
Oh, damn.

24:47.416 --> 24:48.763
Make sure you stretch.

24:55.977 --> 24:57.357
You've been avoiding me.

24:59.532 --> 25:00.913
Uh...

25:02.431 --> 25:04.468
You like darts?

25:06.056 --> 25:07.920
They don't play darts
at Stanford.

25:08.058 --> 25:09.059
You've done your research.

25:09.197 --> 25:10.163
OK.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.682
I'll tell you what.

25:11.820 --> 25:13.615
I'll play darts,
and you can ask me

25:13.753 --> 25:15.065
whatever you couldn't
find on the internet.

25:15.203 --> 25:16.584
Great.

25:16.722 --> 25:18.275
Great.

25:20.104 --> 25:22.659
So did you grow up in
Washington State or DC?

25:22.797 --> 25:23.694
Both.

25:23.832 --> 25:25.351
Moved to DC when I was 12.

25:25.489 --> 25:27.042
It was awful.

25:27.180 --> 25:28.630
Moving into a big mansion?

25:28.768 --> 25:30.252
I bet.

25:30.390 --> 25:31.426
What do you do for work?

25:31.564 --> 25:33.083
Logistics data analyst.

25:33.221 --> 25:34.256
Uh-huh.

25:35.844 --> 25:37.328
Any hobbies?

25:37.466 --> 25:40.987
Honestly,
I don't really have any.

25:41.125 --> 25:42.541
I work a lot.

25:42.679 --> 25:44.715
Analyzing logistics.

25:44.853 --> 25:46.890
- Right.
- Right.

25:48.961 --> 25:51.791
Do you mind me asking when
was your last relationship?

25:51.929 --> 25:53.897
Ended the day I met Charlie.

25:58.833 --> 26:00.904
Listen, I get it.

26:01.042 --> 26:02.457
You're protective
of your brother

26:02.595 --> 26:04.528
after a blindside heartbreak

26:04.666 --> 26:07.462
and the subsequent hook up
that screams rebound.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.571
I'm protective
of my brother too.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.060
But know that I think
Charlie is really special.

26:19.198 --> 26:23.547
And every moment with him is
somehow better than the last.

26:26.136 --> 26:28.172
Also, I may have played
a little darts at Stanford.

26:28.310 --> 26:29.795
Mm-hmm.

26:32.867 --> 26:37.112
OK, Logistics,
how about a rematch?

26:38.424 --> 26:39.977
This time I'll play
right handed.

26:41.013 --> 26:42.531
You're on.

26:46.466 --> 26:49.504
So did I pass the family test?

26:49.642 --> 26:51.471
With flying colors.

26:53.232 --> 26:55.268
I love this,
getting to know them,

26:55.406 --> 26:58.444
seeing what you do
for a living,

26:58.582 --> 27:03.000
getting to know the real
Charlie Nicoletti even more.

27:06.555 --> 27:08.350
Get home safe.

27:16.048 --> 27:17.566
Jonesy.

27:19.948 --> 27:21.605
What are you doing here?

27:21.743 --> 27:23.089
I feel like
it's Christmas Eve,

27:23.227 --> 27:24.781
but I'm the only kid who
knows that Santa is coming,

27:24.919 --> 27:26.058
you know?

27:26.196 --> 27:27.300
Hey, how much do
you think we can

27:27.438 --> 27:28.888
bump the price up to tomorrow?

27:29.026 --> 27:30.027
1.5?

27:30.165 --> 27:31.442
Oh, no.

27:31.580 --> 27:34.169
Come on, maybe
1.7, 1.8 I think?

27:34.307 --> 27:35.723
You know, your idea of
tying the price of the horse

27:35.861 --> 27:38.449
to the odds was a genius.

27:38.587 --> 27:41.556
Yeah, well, you did
the heavy lifting.

27:41.694 --> 27:45.008
We're just here to
collect our cut.

27:45.146 --> 27:46.803
I've pulled off some
fun ones over the years.

27:46.941 --> 27:47.976
You know that.

27:48.114 --> 27:51.255
But Martha is my masterpiece.

27:53.879 --> 27:56.916
Don't know how you do it--

27:57.054 --> 27:58.607
lying to someone
who says she loves you.

27:58.746 --> 28:01.196
I don't think
I could pull that off.

28:01.334 --> 28:03.129
Oh, come on, Charlie.

28:03.267 --> 28:06.615
Love is the oldest con around.

28:06.754 --> 28:08.652
You'd know that
better than anyone.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.404
<i>All right, this is it.</i>

28:36.542 --> 28:37.819
<i>We've got a few hours before
Martha arrives to pump</i>

28:37.957 --> 28:39.545
<i>up the odds on our horse.</i>

28:39.683 --> 28:42.479
<i>The more people we influence
to bet on Wicked Swift,</i>

28:42.617 --> 28:45.033
<i>the more money we all get.</i>

28:45.171 --> 28:47.656
<i>♪ You do to me ♪</i>

28:47.795 --> 28:48.899
<i>♪ I never could believe

28:49.037 --> 28:51.730
Just got 10,000 Twitter
bots for $1,000 bucks.

28:51.868 --> 28:53.593
It's getting
cheaper every year.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.147
That's not
exactly comforting.

28:55.285 --> 28:56.527
Right?

28:56.665 --> 28:58.702
Fly, bots, fly!

29:01.187 --> 29:03.845
I know I said 12 to 1.

29:03.983 --> 29:06.089
But now that I've seen
Wicked Swift with my own eyes,

29:06.227 --> 29:08.712
I don't want anyone giving
clients better than 8 to 1, OK?

29:08.850 --> 29:10.541
8 to 1.

29:10.679 --> 29:11.888
If anyone wants better
odds on Wicked Swift,

29:12.026 --> 29:13.234
they're gonna have to
come to the track

29:13.372 --> 29:14.718
and lay a bet themselves.

29:14.856 --> 29:17.756
<i>♪ You never

29:17.894 --> 29:19.723
<i>♪ Satisfy... ♪</i>

29:19.861 --> 29:21.898
Switch all my parlays
to Wicked Swift in first.

29:22.036 --> 29:23.762
I've heard her name
way too many times

29:23.900 --> 29:25.556
for this not to be something.

29:25.694 --> 29:27.041
I'm not missing out
on this one.

29:37.223 --> 29:38.431
Ha!

29:38.569 --> 29:39.881
Paul Newman Daytona?

29:40.019 --> 29:42.677
Shut the front door.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.472
Fellow connoisseur, huh?

29:44.610 --> 29:46.715
If you held on to that
through the '87 market crash,

29:46.854 --> 29:49.097
you must be one
hell of a trader.

29:49.235 --> 29:50.719
Am I that obvious?

29:50.858 --> 29:53.239
Nah, I just know
how to spot a winner.

30:03.387 --> 30:05.113
<i>Welcome back to
Baltimore Downs.</i>

30:05.251 --> 30:08.876
<i>It is now ten minutes
before the final race.</i>

30:09.014 --> 30:11.637
All right, one last step.

30:11.775 --> 30:14.743
I need you to slip me his
cell phone for 30 seconds.

30:14.882 --> 30:16.815
I will switch account numbers
in the Escrow app

30:16.953 --> 30:18.713
so that no money
comes from you.

30:20.025 --> 30:21.785
And his money goes to us.

30:21.923 --> 30:24.408
This is just money for you,
but it's my life.

30:24.546 --> 30:26.445
OK?

30:26.583 --> 30:29.241
No one has ever made me
feel the way he has.

30:29.379 --> 30:31.450
It can't all be a lie.

30:31.588 --> 30:33.970
Martha, that's exactly
how he wants you to feel.

30:34.108 --> 30:35.764
- I just--
- Hey, babe.

30:36.558 --> 30:37.905
Are you ready to
be a horse owner?

30:38.043 --> 30:39.872
Hey, yeah.

30:41.391 --> 30:43.496
You know what, Frankie,
I was thinking,

30:43.634 --> 30:46.465
what if instead of a horse,

30:46.603 --> 30:48.985
we use this money
to travel the world?

30:49.123 --> 30:52.195
Yeah? I'll take some
time off starting now.

30:52.333 --> 30:56.371
We can do villas and castles,
overwater bungalows,

30:56.509 --> 30:58.718
any of it, all of it.

30:59.616 --> 31:00.755
That sounds incredible.

31:02.170 --> 31:03.965
I just really want us
to be together.

31:04.103 --> 31:06.726
That's all that matters to me.

31:08.452 --> 31:12.663
It's just, I--
I really want this horse.

31:12.801 --> 31:15.839
You know, it's a once in
a lifetime opportunity.

31:20.740 --> 31:22.466
Of course.

31:22.604 --> 31:24.675
I'm so stupid.
What was I thinking?

31:24.813 --> 31:27.782
No, it's--you know, let's
take a photo to celebrate.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.818
- Sure.
- Oh, shoot.

31:29.957 --> 31:31.475
I forgot my phone in the car.

31:31.613 --> 31:33.305
Can I borrow yours
quickly, honey?

31:33.443 --> 31:35.031
Great.
Thank you so much.

31:35.169 --> 31:36.791
Hey, Amber, would you mind?

31:36.929 --> 31:38.310
Of course.

31:38.448 --> 31:40.553
- Let's burn the prick.
- Yes, ma'am.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.900
Here we go.

31:42.038 --> 31:44.212
Oh, thank you.

31:44.350 --> 31:45.973
All right.

31:46.111 --> 31:49.079
Oh, look at you two.

31:49.217 --> 31:51.081
That's beautiful.

31:51.219 --> 31:53.497
Oh, is that--oh, I
think I might have missed--

31:53.635 --> 31:55.672
oh, did I delete it?
- No, no.

31:55.810 --> 31:57.053
No, you just closed
the app, that's all.

31:57.191 --> 31:58.226
See?
Here you go.

31:58.364 --> 32:01.091
Great.
Oh, wow.

32:01.229 --> 32:02.990
- Wow.
- Look how happy you look.

32:03.128 --> 32:04.370
Well, that's because I am.

32:04.508 --> 32:05.509
Congratulations.

32:05.647 --> 32:06.545
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

32:06.683 --> 32:07.822
Thank you.

32:09.651 --> 32:10.756
<i>It's a process
known as high rose.</i>

32:10.894 --> 32:14.104
Am I in the right house?

32:14.242 --> 32:15.347
I sent the staff home early.

32:15.485 --> 32:17.521
It has been a crazy
couple of days.

32:17.659 --> 32:19.834
- Hey, honey.
- Hi.

32:19.972 --> 32:21.732
Oh, please no.

32:21.870 --> 32:23.562
I don't think I can hear
the word race anymore today.

32:23.700 --> 32:24.873
Come on.
It's that big one.

32:25.012 --> 32:26.737
Remember we went
one year, honey,

32:26.875 --> 32:28.843
with that big media tycoon.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.707
You two at the Derby?

32:30.845 --> 32:32.881
Yes.
And I was pregnant with David.

32:33.020 --> 32:34.814
Oh, yeah.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.713
We weren't telling anyone yet,
and we didn't want to offend

32:36.851 --> 32:38.197
the media guy,
so you were secretly

32:38.335 --> 32:39.992
passing all your drinks to me.

32:40.130 --> 32:42.201
That was the most
drunk you've ever been.

32:42.339 --> 32:43.582
Well, that you know of.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.101
Wow.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.832
OK, don't look now, but the
Hill family is drinking beer,

32:52.971 --> 32:55.111
eating leftover pizza,
and watching a sporting event

32:55.249 --> 32:56.698
like a normal family.

32:56.836 --> 32:58.217
We're a normal family.

32:58.355 --> 33:00.219
- Right.
- Sorry to interrupt.

33:00.357 --> 33:01.600
David?

33:06.915 --> 33:09.884
- Hey.
- I've got some bad news.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.644
The party's pulling
their support.

33:12.611 --> 33:15.510
Without them in our corner--
- Yeah.

33:15.648 --> 33:17.167
The campaign's dead.

33:20.964 --> 33:23.346
Let's keep this
between us for now.

33:23.484 --> 33:26.487
We'll regroup tomorrow and...

33:26.625 --> 33:29.145
decide on a plan
in the first light of day.

33:53.617 --> 33:55.861
If you can do it in your
underwear, it's not a job.

33:55.999 --> 33:56.931
That ain't work.

33:57.069 --> 33:58.726
No.

33:58.864 --> 34:00.383
These kids today,
they'll never have

34:00.521 --> 34:02.385
to go through what we did.

34:04.145 --> 34:06.285
Oh, Nellie.

34:06.423 --> 34:08.322
You're eyeing a big bet, huh?

34:10.496 --> 34:12.912
Well, don't hold out on me!

34:13.051 --> 34:14.500
After all the stock tips
I doled out?

34:14.638 --> 34:16.709
I'm just a humble
owner of a dive bar.

34:16.847 --> 34:18.366
50K is a lot of money for me.

34:18.504 --> 34:20.748
But that's how sure I am
that I'll walk out of here

34:20.886 --> 34:23.509
tonight with six times that.

34:23.647 --> 34:25.063
Well, whatever it is, I'm in.

34:25.201 --> 34:26.719
I'll go 50K too.
- Ooh hoo hoo!

34:26.857 --> 34:28.307
Hell, 100K!

34:30.447 --> 34:32.725
50,000 on Wicked Swift.

34:32.863 --> 34:36.177
100,000 on Wicked Swift.

34:36.315 --> 34:37.730
1,000 on Wicked Swift.

34:37.868 --> 34:39.318
500 for Wicked Swift, please.

34:51.399 --> 34:53.884
Where the hell have you been?

34:54.022 --> 34:56.784
Whisper campaign
worked too well.

34:56.922 --> 34:58.061
There was a blast
of live bets, which

34:58.199 --> 35:00.028
caused a surge of online bets.

35:00.167 --> 35:01.858
Odds closed past Martha's cap.

35:01.996 --> 35:02.997
No way, really?

35:03.135 --> 35:05.758
4 to 1.
That's 2.5 mil.

35:05.896 --> 35:06.897
Can't she just kick
in a little extra?

35:07.035 --> 35:08.278
Are you kidding me?

35:08.416 --> 35:09.245
She's a stickler
for negotiations.

35:09.383 --> 35:11.247
That's her whole job.

35:13.041 --> 35:14.353
Hold on.

35:14.491 --> 35:17.356
Let him set the hook first.

35:17.494 --> 35:18.875
Right now Jones
is panicking, which

35:19.013 --> 35:20.704
is exactly what the con is
designed to get him to do,

35:20.842 --> 35:22.741
to think irrationally.

35:22.879 --> 35:24.122
And now...

35:25.157 --> 35:26.572
Hey, how about this?

35:26.710 --> 35:29.092
You put in your own money,
make up the difference.

35:29.230 --> 35:30.714
A half mil?

35:30.852 --> 35:32.199
That's a hell of a convincer.

35:32.337 --> 35:34.270
Think of it like
a ten-minute loan.

35:34.408 --> 35:35.616
I mean, it's your money.

35:35.754 --> 35:37.652
It's ours.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.902
Shall we?

35:49.423 --> 35:51.218
All right, we're ready.

35:54.359 --> 35:57.120
First time I ever sold
a horse on my phone.

35:57.258 --> 35:59.467
There really is an app
for everything.

35:59.605 --> 36:00.917
So what's the price?

36:01.055 --> 36:02.815
It's 2.5.

36:02.953 --> 36:04.921
But don't worry,
I'm covering the difference

36:05.059 --> 36:06.164
from my savings.

36:06.302 --> 36:08.235
I already put
my account info in.

36:08.373 --> 36:10.996
All right, rolling.
Everyone?

36:11.134 --> 36:12.480
Go ahead and eSign the app.

36:12.618 --> 36:13.826
Yes I do.

36:13.964 --> 36:16.967
And I just did.

36:17.105 --> 36:18.969
Well, congratulations, everyone.

36:19.107 --> 36:20.592
Let me get some
glasses for everybody.

36:20.730 --> 36:22.007
Congratulations.

36:22.145 --> 36:24.009
Just gonna get
a better view of my new horse

36:24.147 --> 36:25.183
before the big race.
- Yeah.

36:41.026 --> 36:43.477
<i>There they go.
Away from the gate...</i>

36:50.794 --> 36:52.210
Airport.

36:58.630 --> 37:02.496
<i>Congratulations,
Misty Queen on second--</i>

37:14.508 --> 37:17.235
When do you think
Jonesy will figure it out?

37:17.373 --> 37:18.753
Probably about the same time
he lands

37:18.891 --> 37:20.790
wherever it is he's going.

37:22.723 --> 37:24.725
Hey, do you want to
know how our horse did?

37:24.863 --> 37:26.209
You don't have to tell me.

37:26.347 --> 37:28.487
I know a sixth place horse
when I see one.

37:28.625 --> 37:30.178
Come on.

37:47.851 --> 37:49.715
Hey, Mom?

37:49.853 --> 37:51.683
Mom, wake up!

37:51.821 --> 37:53.857
Where the hell is Ollie?

37:53.995 --> 37:55.203
She's here.

37:55.342 --> 37:57.205
She's--she's right there.

38:24.405 --> 38:26.062
Hey.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.581
Uh, thanks to your
niece's petulance,

38:27.719 --> 38:29.203
we know what
Daphne's been up to.

38:29.341 --> 38:30.963
I'm sorry, you lost me.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.586
Ollie slipped her tracker
into Daphne's purse.

38:35.036 --> 38:36.452
What?

38:36.590 --> 38:37.763
Let's compare it
to Daphne's notebook.

38:37.901 --> 38:38.764
Wait.

38:38.902 --> 38:40.421
Mm-hmm.

38:40.559 --> 38:42.458
OK, hey, where was she
at 8:00 p.m. last night?

38:42.596 --> 38:43.804
Ellicott City.

38:43.942 --> 38:47.325
OK, where was
she 3:00 p.m. today?

38:47.463 --> 38:48.464
Pikesville.

38:48.602 --> 38:50.362
Pikesville.

38:50.500 --> 38:53.020
That's--that's Russian and
Taiwanese cartel territory.

38:53.158 --> 38:55.505
So why would Daphne be
meeting with rival cartels?

38:55.643 --> 38:57.473
I don't think meeting
with rival cartels

38:57.611 --> 38:59.164
is part of Connor's MO.

38:59.302 --> 39:01.269
So maybe Connor doesn't
know what she's up to.

39:01.408 --> 39:03.479
So our secret
daughter thinks she's

39:03.617 --> 39:06.792
the one calling the shots
for the Maguire empire.

39:06.930 --> 39:09.450
You know it'd be a real
shame if that got out.

39:09.588 --> 39:10.900
Huh.

39:11.038 --> 39:12.177
Right.

39:12.315 --> 39:13.765
All right.

39:24.569 --> 39:26.812
Who's this?

39:26.950 --> 39:28.642
Someone
with mutual interests.

39:28.780 --> 39:30.298
Did you know that Daphne
Finch is making moves

39:30.437 --> 39:32.197
<i>with your rivals over here?</i>

39:32.335 --> 39:33.716
What the hell are
you going on about?

39:33.854 --> 39:37.513
Russians, Dominicans,
Taiwanese triads--

39:37.651 --> 39:40.067
all groups who sell
the same product as you,

39:40.205 --> 39:42.380
<i>and all groups
that she has met with.</i>

39:42.518 --> 39:44.451
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say that your sister's

39:44.589 --> 39:45.900
taking a run at your crown.

39:46.038 --> 39:49.559
<i>See, I don't have a sister.</i>

39:52.700 --> 39:56.290
You sure about that?

39:59.086 --> 40:01.122
Who'd you say you are?

40:02.434 --> 40:04.816
I didn't.

40:14.342 --> 40:15.516
What'd you find?

40:15.654 --> 40:16.931
Another massive
deposit was just

40:17.069 --> 40:18.208
made from the
Maguire U.S. account

40:18.346 --> 40:21.004
into the Maguire
Ireland account.

40:21.142 --> 40:22.903
How can Daphne make
such a big payment

40:23.041 --> 40:25.733
if she's selling their product
at bargain basement prices?

40:25.871 --> 40:27.355
She's not selling
off to get out.

40:27.494 --> 40:29.288
She's currying favor
with rivals,

40:29.427 --> 40:32.844
which means she's building
something even bigger.

40:32.982 --> 40:34.362
But if she's still making
payments to Ireland,

40:34.501 --> 40:36.710
that means she's found
a new revenue stream.

40:36.848 --> 40:38.297
If we find that--

40:38.436 --> 40:39.367
We can tear it down
whatever fresh hell

40:39.506 --> 40:41.266
she's trying to build.

40:41.404 --> 40:43.095
Let's follow the money.

40:43.233 --> 40:45.373
Hill, Cass wants to
see you in his office.

40:45.512 --> 40:46.996
Thanks.

40:48.584 --> 40:50.102
Jones, what happened?

40:50.240 --> 40:51.932
<i>I don't know how, but
our sneaky ass accountants</i>

40:52.070 --> 40:53.451
<i>got to the money
before the transfer.</i>

40:53.589 --> 40:55.418
<i>Got mine too.</i>

40:55.556 --> 40:56.764
<i>Obviously, I can't give you a
cut of something I don't have.</i>

40:56.902 --> 40:58.594
So hold on,
let me get this straight.

40:58.732 --> 41:01.079
We stick our necks out,
and you're gonna stiff us.

41:01.217 --> 41:02.805
<i>Dude, I'm out
500 of my own here.</i>

41:02.943 --> 41:04.254
<i>I'll get you on the next one.</i>

41:04.392 --> 41:06.084
Yeah, hey, you know what?
Don't bother, pal.

41:08.673 --> 41:11.192
Con men never see it coming.

41:12.193 --> 41:14.092
I hope Martha is OK.

41:14.230 --> 41:15.852
I'm sure
she's better than Jonesy.

41:15.990 --> 41:17.578
Maybe.

41:17.716 --> 41:19.960
It's gotta hurt, having
somebody lie to you like that.

41:20.098 --> 41:22.065
I mean, you've been there.

41:22.203 --> 41:24.412
You know.

41:24.551 --> 41:25.690
Yeah.

41:29.383 --> 41:31.489
<i>And I'll call you back ASAP.</i>

41:31.627 --> 41:33.007
Hey, Em.

41:33.145 --> 41:34.802
Trying to track you down.

41:34.940 --> 41:36.597
Wanna talk about something.

41:36.735 --> 41:38.599
OK, call me back.

41:47.746 --> 41:48.609
Get off me!
