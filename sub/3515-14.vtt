the fetus was not harmed,

10:16.040 --> 10:17.724

her body will replenish it
within five to seven days.

the amniotic fluid out of her?

with a thick needle.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.806

10:34.880 --> 10:36.609

10:36.680 --> 10:39.047
the mother goes into labor

would want amniotic fluid?

minutes before we arrived on scene.

he wasn't there

12:05.720 --> 12:07.882
doesn't mean he wasn't involved.

I don't think he'd do
anything to hurt Dana.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.080
And Dana wouldn't stay
with him if he ever did.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.565
I've known her since
we were in diapers.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.290
And I'd make a joke
about diapers right now,

12:15.360 --> 12:16.885

I'm not in the mood.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.604

24:50.560 --> 24:52.483
Hundreds of years of tradition.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.006
I won't be a part
of this tradition!

24:55.400 --> 24:57.687
You can make another baby.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.770
But you only have one mother.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.522
You owe me this.

25:06.160 --> 25:07.161
No.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.571
I said no!

25:08.880 --> 25:09.927
Sam!

25:10.640 --> 25:12.688
You're my son.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.565
I'm begging you.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.771
Please.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.684
I don't want to die.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.282
This is a plane ticket
back to Manila.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.362
I'm giving you
a chance to leave.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.442
No!
If you don't take it,

25:34.520 --> 25:36.090
I'm going to call the police.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.170
Do you understand me?

25:41.760 --> 25:42.761
(DOOR SLAMS)

25:57.280 --> 25:58.691
(HISSING)

26:01.960 --> 26:04.327
Can't believe Sam
brought so much stuff.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.289
You were only here one night.

26:06.480 --> 26:09.529
He just wanted to make sure
I was comfortable. Ah.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.210
Where is he, anyway?

26:12.440 --> 26:13.646
I thought he was on
his way over here.

26:13.720 --> 26:15.320
I'm sure he just ran
a couple of errands,

26:15.360 --> 26:17.124
because I'm not
there to help him.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.970
He'll be here soon.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.485
Okay. Well,

26:21.000 --> 26:23.446
sure will be nice
to be back home.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.725
I'm scared, to be honest.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.290
What happened...

26:31.560 --> 26:33.005
It will be hard
to feel safe again.

26:33.080 --> 26:34.286
But you will be.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.365
I'll make sure of that.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.685
Thank you for
everything you've done.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.524
You're such a good friend.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.003
I'm just happy you're okay.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.371
What are you doing here?

26:51.200 --> 26:52.486
He's helping me pack.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.164
Sam, you made it.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.204
We were starting to worry.

26:56.920 --> 26:58.365
You Okay?

26:58.520 --> 27:01.000
You seem...
Yeah, sorry.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.368
It's been a long day.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.931
Can I talk to you for a second?

27:06.760 --> 27:08.205
I'll be back.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.570
Where were you?

27:11.840 --> 27:13.280
You were in such
a hurry to get here.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.970
I stopped by to visit my mom.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.244
Your mom's
in Portland? Where?

27:19.640 --> 27:23.201
She's at the Viking Motel,
but she's leaving.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.169
She's going back to Manila.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.289
Why wasn't she
staying with you and Dana?

27:27.360 --> 27:30.011
Because my mom and Dana
don't get along.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.971
Well, I guess that explains why
she's not at the hospital.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.560
I'm taking Dana home.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.642
The claw marks, blood trail.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.569
How do you explain all that?

27:40.960 --> 27:42.724
You're the cop.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.804
How do you explain it?

27:47.120 --> 27:48.929
You hurt Dana in any way...

27:49.040 --> 27:51.441
She's my wife, not yours.

27:53.760 --> 27:54.807
Just get over it.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.684
Leave us alone.

28:04.920 --> 28:07.082
NICK: "I arrived in
the Philippines at Manila,

28:07.160 --> 28:10.164
"May of 1904, after a long
arduous voyage from..."

28:10.240 --> 28:11.446
Do we have to
start at the beginning?

28:11.600 --> 28:12.880
Yeah, pick it up
right before the

28:12.920 --> 28:14.445
"and then I cut
off his head" part.

28:14.640 --> 28:15.641
All right.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.966
Uh... "Snuck down
the putrid alley.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.088
"Fetid smell of blood,"
Blah, blah.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.367
"Cut off its..."
Okay, too far.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.724
Okay, okay.

28:27.120 --> 28:29.566
"After the midwife was able
to quell the hemorrhaging,

28:29.640 --> 28:31.529
"the young woman
gained consciousness.

28:31.920 --> 28:35.208
"She told me it was an Aswang

28:35.280 --> 28:36.805
"that had caused the tragedy.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.411
"She had been sold as a bride,

28:40.480 --> 28:42.448
"to be impregnated
so that her firstborn

28:42.520 --> 28:43.806
"may be consumed as a means

28:43.880 --> 28:45.803
"for a prolonged,
healthy life."

28:46.560 --> 28:47.891
This is what we're looking for.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.803
"Aswangs use their long tongues

28:49.880 --> 28:52.087
"to inject chewed up
valerian root

28:52.160 --> 28:54.128
"to sedate their
victims as they attack."

28:54.200 --> 28:56.168
That explains why Dana
can't remember much.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.890
JULIETTE: "These attacks
are often incorrectly

28:57.960 --> 29:01.123
"diagnosed as miscarriages,
and for the process to work,

29:01.200 --> 29:04.010
"the fetus must be a blood
relative to the Aswang."

29:04.480 --> 29:06.005
That's some family obligations.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.161
Wait, what does that say?

29:07.320 --> 29:10.483
"I've also learned that Aswang
have an alternate name.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.723
"Tik-tiks,
due to the ticking sound

29:12.800 --> 29:14.325
"they make
with their tongue."

29:16.040 --> 29:18.760
The neighbor said she heard a ticking
sound coming from Dana's house.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.447
Whoa! There it is.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.371
Now we're talking ugly.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.081
Now that we know what we're
dealing with, what do we tell Wu?

29:27.200 --> 29:28.929
Oh, no, no.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.686
I don't think
an Aswang is a very good

29:31.760 --> 29:33.171
gateway Wesen for a Kehrseite.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.089
I'm not sure there
is a good gateway.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.400
It's more of a hell gate.
Mmm-hmm.

29:36.480 --> 29:39.609
We can't risk involving him in
something that he doesn't understand.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.609
But we can't let him
think he's going crazy.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.007
I know that feeling too well,
and I just can't stand by...

29:44.080 --> 29:47.289
I don't think we should give
him any premature information.

29:47.360 --> 29:50.330
Yes, premature information
can be very messy.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.562
Hearing the truth
is not the problem.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.643
It's seeing and not
being able to explain

29:54.720 --> 29:56.320
what it is that
pushes you over the edge.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.926
You were confronted with it.
You had no choice.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.208
Hank, I'm sorry.
I kind of agree with 'em.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.643
I mean, this is life-changing
information we're talking about.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.245
Wu needs to know
what he's going up against.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.402
You leave him unprepared,
anything could happen.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.723
Look, I don't want
to drag him into this,

30:10.880 --> 30:13.087
not unless we
absolutely have to.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.004
If you all think that's the
way it should be, okay.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.451
Let's go see if Dana and Sam have
any blood relatives in town.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.402
Sam, can I ask you something?

30:31.800 --> 30:32.926
Sure.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.889
What's up with you and Drew?

30:36.520 --> 30:37.931
Uh, what do you mean?

30:38.560 --> 30:40.449
You're angry with each other.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.449
I can see it.
No, it's just

30:42.520 --> 30:44.010
we're both under
a lot of pressure.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.090
Because of me?

30:48.280 --> 30:51.523
Sometimes I don't understand why
you're still friends with him.

30:53.240 --> 30:54.526
It's awkward.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.443
I've known him all my life.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.887
He's a close friend
and always will be.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.844
There's nothing more to it.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.321
Yeah.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.969
Yeah, okay, okay.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.121
Hey.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.606
We're home.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.451
That's more like it.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.808
Uh, I hate to sound
like a broken record,

31:20.120 --> 31:21.770
but any progress?

31:23.120 --> 31:24.610
No, not much.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.205
We're looking in
the family history.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.169
Trying to see if Sam or Dana

31:28.280 --> 31:29.805
have any family in Portland.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.365
Well, I guess you didn't
come to the right guy.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.487
Sam's mom's in town.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.721
His mom's in Portland?

31:33.880 --> 31:35.370
Yeah, Sam told me
at the hospital.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.609
Where's she staying?
At the Viking Motel.

31:37.680 --> 31:40.251
But I think she's catching
a plane home tonight.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.321
I thought it was a little weird

31:41.400 --> 31:42.640
she wasn't staying
with Sam and Dana.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.121
You know her name?
Lani Tomas.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.164
Hey, I really need
to talk to you guys.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.686
I can't quite explain it,

31:53.760 --> 31:57.765
but I'm struggling
with some stuff right now.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.011
I think Sam might be guilty.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.161
Why?

32:05.760 --> 32:06.761
(SIGHS)

32:09.840 --> 32:13.162
There is this Filipino myth about
something called an Aswang.

32:13.760 --> 32:17.207
It's a sort of scary creature

32:17.280 --> 32:19.567
that preys on pregnant women.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.290
I think Sam could be
trying to kill Dana

32:21.360 --> 32:24.409
and making it seem like some
sort of supernatural event.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.609
Well, um, (CHUCKLES)

32:32.080 --> 32:33.844
that is quite a theory.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.922
All right, look. I know it
sounds a little out there,

32:36.000 --> 32:37.650
but I don't know.

32:37.960 --> 32:38.961
I just...

32:39.480 --> 32:40.891
I thought I better tell you.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.485
You know, just in case.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.842
(SIGHS) So, there ya go.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.044
That's my crazy theory.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.201
I know, it's late.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.331
I'm going home.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.481
I'm gonna have a drink.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.450
Not necessarily in that order.
(SIGHS)

32:59.400 --> 33:01.129
I got to say something.
Hank.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.320
Wu!

33:05.600 --> 33:07.090
Yeah, good luck with that.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.287
Wu.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.568
I don't think
it's a crazy theory.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.604
But sometimes things
can't be explained.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.730
I just hope my past with Dana

33:23.800 --> 33:26.849
isn't what's making me think
Sam's the bad guy here.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.241
I think you should
give your instincts

33:29.360 --> 33:30.600
a little more credit than that.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.484
I'm not sure I want to.

33:33.920 --> 33:36.526
But thanks. Good night.

33:41.480 --> 33:42.811
I know what on
the verge looks like,

33:42.880 --> 33:44.803
and he is definitely
on the verge.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.844
He doesn't think
any of this is real.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.691
Yeah. Let's hope
it stays that way.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.610
Let's go find Lani Tomas.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.040
(RINGING)

33:58.800 --> 34:00.370
Are you calling
to check up on me?

34:00.520 --> 34:02.170
No, actually I'm just calling

34:02.240 --> 34:04.208
to check up on you
and see how you're doing.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.289
That's really
sweet of you, thanks.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.601
Everything's fine.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.245
Sam's taking good care of me.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.290
Okay, good to hear.

34:13.719 --> 34:14.801
You don't need anything?

34:14.880 --> 34:16.643
I'm good and I'm tired.

34:17.520 --> 34:20.603
And thanks for watching over me.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.288
Well, I can't stop now.

34:24.639 --> 34:25.641
Good night.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.400
Talk soon.

34:31.560 --> 34:32.561
(SIGHS)

34:55.120 --> 34:56.326
Lani?

35:16.200 --> 35:18.487
What the hell is that?

35:29.400 --> 35:32.802
Mrs. Tomas got here two days
ago from the Philippines.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.609
Please don't tell me
she's an ax murderer.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.648
Did she say she was
checking out or going home?

35:36.720 --> 35:38.722
Not to me.
But she left a while ago.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.643
I saw her get into a cab.

35:49.640 --> 35:52.166
Well, the cab isn't
going to the airport.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.324
What cab company?
Radio Cab.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.606
I've got the number
if you need it.

35:56.680 --> 35:57.681
HANK: I know it.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.206
Valerian root.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.601
If that's a drug, I don't
know anything about it.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.444
This is Detective Griffin,
Portland PD.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.043
I need a destination
address for a pick-up

36:12.120 --> 36:14.441
from a Viking Motel,
about an hour ago.

36:16.760 --> 36:17.966
(CREAKING)

36:32.440 --> 36:33.680
(TICKING)

36:34.920 --> 36:35.921
(SHRIEKING)

36:37.880 --> 36:39.325
(GRUNTING)

36:40.000 --> 36:41.206
Sam?

36:42.280 --> 36:43.281
Sam?

36:46.480 --> 36:47.766
Lani?

36:47.840 --> 36:50.127
My darling, Dana.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.964
Sam called me

36:52.040 --> 36:55.283
and told me you had
a terrible accident.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.485
I didn't know you were here.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.041
When did you arrive?

36:59.120 --> 37:01.441
Sam asked me to come right away

37:01.520 --> 37:03.807
and help take care of you.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.651
What a nice surprise.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.803
You didn't have to
come all the way here.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.166
Oh, I did.

37:09.240 --> 37:13.086
Childbirth can be so difficult

37:13.160 --> 37:16.084
without someone who knows
how to make it easier.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.201
Hmm?

37:17.800 --> 37:19.040
Where's Sam?

37:19.120 --> 37:20.406
He's downstairs,

37:20.480 --> 37:22.960
fixing me something to eat.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.209
(HUMMING GENTLY)

37:38.800 --> 37:40.450
(HUMMING CONTINUES)

37:41.880 --> 37:43.723
That's right.

37:43.800 --> 37:46.280
You just rest.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.931
(HUMMING)

38:04.120 --> 38:05.406
(HUMMING)

38:08.880 --> 38:10.211
(SNARLING)

38:30.680 --> 38:31.966
(TICKING)

38:35.240 --> 38:36.730
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

38:39.600 --> 38:40.681
(TICKING CONTINUES)

38:40.760 --> 38:41.761
(WU GASPS)

38:41.920 --> 38:43.365
(PANTING)

38:44.840 --> 38:45.921
Aswang.

38:46.040 --> 38:47.530
(SCREECHES)

38:48.400 --> 38:50.084
(TIRES SQUEALING)

38:56.240 --> 38:58.766
Paramedics needed at
3403 Forman Street.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.841
(HEAVY THUD)

39:02.720 --> 39:04.245
(GRUNTING)

39:09.800 --> 39:11.086
(SCREAMS)

39:11.880 --> 39:13.120
(GUNSHOT)
(SCREECHES)

39:14.640 --> 39:16.085
(PANTING)

39:17.920 --> 39:19.445
(GRUNTING)

39:33.880 --> 39:35.041
it was an Aswang.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.441
Did you see it?

39:37.560 --> 39:39.562
Wu, calm down.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.011
She wasn't like that!

39:41.080 --> 39:42.206
She was not like that!

39:42.280 --> 39:43.645
Dana's alive.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.201
It changed.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.689
I swear, I know what I saw!

39:47.800 --> 39:49.040
Wu...
Nick!

39:49.120 --> 39:50.326
I know what I saw!

39:50.480 --> 39:51.641
Look at me.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.211
Dana's alive.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.290
Just breathe and calm down.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.124
No, it wasn't her.
It wasn't her.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.647
Just breathe. Relax. It wasn't her.
It wasn't her.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.529
Breathe.
It wasn't her.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.125
It wasn't her.
You're okay.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.202
It wasn't her.
It wasn't her.

40:05.520 --> 40:08.126
It wasn't her.
That was not her.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.971
It wasn't her.
It wasn't her.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.685
It wasn't her.
It wasn't her.

40:13.040 --> 40:16.010
It wasn't her.
It wasn't her.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.169
It wasn't her. It wasn't her.
It wasn't her.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.561
(BUZZING)

41:01.800 --> 41:04.531
DOCTOR: The good news is
he checked in on his own.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.200
He's experienced
a very traumatic event.

41:07.680 --> 41:10.001
The bad news is
whatever happened,

41:10.080 --> 41:12.560
he's having a tough
time talking about it.

41:12.880 --> 41:16.805
I'm glad you came by. It might
be good for him to see you.

41:23.680 --> 41:24.886
Hey, Wu.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.087
Hey.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.520
How you doing?

41:38.640 --> 41:40.165
We just, um,

41:40.800 --> 41:43.371
wanted to tell you...

41:44.080 --> 41:47.050
Sam's mom had
a history of violent behavior.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.565
HAN K: That's why
she attacked you.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.722
But you saved Sam and Dana.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.924
The baby's gonna be okay.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.930
You're a hero, Wu.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.441
Yeah?

42:04.240 --> 42:05.526
Yeah.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.371
Well, that's good.

42:07.800 --> 42:08.801
That's good.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.443
