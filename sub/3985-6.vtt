02:12.813 --> 02:17.371
On this Sunday
before the primary

02:17.519 --> 02:21.979
when we will go to the polls
to exercise our blessed franchise,

02:22.127 --> 02:26.417
our lesson comes from
Exodus, chapter 18.

02:26.566 --> 02:29.588
"And it came to pass
on the morrow

02:29.736 --> 02:33.059
that Moses sat
to judge the people:

02:33.207 --> 02:35.563
and the people stood by him

02:35.711 --> 02:38.400
from the morning
unto the evening.

02:38.549 --> 02:41.639
And Moses judged the people.

02:41.787 --> 02:46.711
And he shouldered
this tremendous burden all alone.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.415
And one day,
his father-in-law said to him,

02:49.564 --> 02:53.187
'Moses, why do you carry this

02:53.336 --> 02:56.325
awesome responsibility
by yourself?

02:56.474 --> 03:00.698
You need other wise men
to help you rule

03:00.846 --> 03:03.301
justly over the people.'

03:03.450 --> 03:07.373
So Moses hearkened to the voice
of his father-in-law,

03:07.521 --> 03:12.013
and chose able men
to rule over the people."

03:12.161 --> 03:14.317
Can I preach it like I feel it?

03:14.465 --> 03:17.988
Hey hey hey.

03:18.136 --> 03:19.857
This Tuesday,

03:20.006 --> 03:23.094
when we choose
the men and women

03:23.243 --> 03:25.231
who will lead our city,

03:25.379 --> 03:29.604
we would do well to keep
those standards in mind.

03:29.752 --> 03:31.707
Men of truth,

03:31.856 --> 03:35.846
who fear God
and hate covetousness.

03:35.993 --> 03:38.053
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

03:47.176 --> 03:49.441
Hey.

03:52.116 --> 03:53.737
God bless you.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.106
Good to see you.

03:55.253 --> 03:56.140
How you doing?

03:56.287 --> 03:57.475
- Just fine.
- How's Mama?

03:57.623 --> 04:00.313
- Tell her I said hello.
- Fellowship committee at 2:00?

04:00.461 --> 04:01.915
- If I'm late...
- We'll wait.

04:02.064 --> 04:05.720
All right. Thank you for coming,
young man, young lady.

04:05.868 --> 04:07.122
- Reverend.
- Councilman.

04:07.270 --> 04:08.491
Mrs. Carcetti.
How are you?

04:08.638 --> 04:10.126
Thank you so much
for having us.

04:10.274 --> 04:11.827
- Thank you.
- lnteresting sermon.

04:11.976 --> 04:13.430
Polls seem to think
you have a chance.

04:13.578 --> 04:14.899
Well, we're within
the margin of error.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.303
Margin of error.
That's an interesting phrase.

04:17.451 --> 04:20.406
And I see you've got
Delegate Watkins working the crowd.

04:20.555 --> 04:22.208
Well, I'm hoping
he's not going to be the only one.

04:22.357 --> 04:23.978
I'll tell you what, Councilman.

04:24.126 --> 04:27.883
I will keep an open mind
until I walk into that booth on Tuesday.

04:28.032 --> 04:30.220
- And if you win--
- You're holding me to a high standard.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.557
- Moses? I mean, Jesus, Reverend...
- Tommy.

04:32.705 --> 04:34.961
I'm sorry. I can't believe I said that.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.629
Moses will do for now.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.733
We'll save Jesus
for your second term.

04:39.881 --> 04:41.135
- Have a good one now.
- Thank you.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.409
Thank you all
so much for coming.

06:41.947 --> 06:44.670
- Signs o' life?
- Not even a lookout.

06:44.819 --> 06:48.208
- Maybe they went to church.
- Our Lady of the Re-up.

06:48.356 --> 06:49.811
He'll show up sooner or later.

06:49.959 --> 06:53.225
- Call me.
- All right.

06:58.303 --> 07:00.759
Vote for Carcetti.

07:00.907 --> 07:04.097
Vote for Carcetti
on Tuesday.

07:04.245 --> 07:06.534
Tommy Carcetti running
for mayor. Thanks.

07:06.682 --> 07:08.235
- Hello, Councilman.
- Good morning.

07:08.383 --> 07:10.672
I've been following
your campaign. I'm a teacher.

07:10.820 --> 07:12.808
- Excellent.
- High-school biology.

07:12.956 --> 07:15.780
- What? Here in the city?
- Baltimore County. I just wanted say

07:15.928 --> 07:17.683
I think your position
on school-board reform

07:17.830 --> 07:19.952
- is very encouraging.
- So you'd vote for me?

07:20.100 --> 07:21.888
If I lived in the city,
I absolutely would.

07:22.035 --> 07:25.438
- Good luck on Tuesday.
- Thank you.

07:27.509 --> 07:28.797
They're all fucking county people.

07:28.945 --> 07:30.632
We're almost
done here anyway.

07:30.781 --> 07:33.505
- Thomas, look at this.
- What's that?

07:33.652 --> 07:35.574
Check it out.

07:35.722 --> 07:39.178
In your private practice,
you ever represent a Bobby Harrison?

07:39.326 --> 07:40.747
The slumlord?
Fuck, no.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.749
I don't remember ever
even meeting this guy.

07:42.898 --> 07:44.419
"Carcetti got the most
serious charges dismissed

07:44.566 --> 07:46.921
and the others reduced
to small fines.

07:47.069 --> 07:49.392
The slumlord once again walked free
with a slap on the wrist

07:49.540 --> 07:51.095
while hundreds of tenants
continue to suffer

07:51.242 --> 07:52.763
substandard living conditions."

07:52.911 --> 07:54.266
Last-minute smear.
They're running scared.

07:54.413 --> 07:56.068
- Royce.
- Who else?

07:56.216 --> 07:57.837
65% of the city rents.

07:57.985 --> 08:00.207
Bobby Harrison's name
is dirt in this town.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.243
Two days before the election
and they smear me?

08:02.391 --> 08:04.280
Courthouse steps.
When the fuck was this taken?

08:04.428 --> 08:06.683
- It's a fake. They photo-shopped me.
- We have time to prove that?

08:06.830 --> 08:08.185
- We can try.
- Try, shit.

08:08.332 --> 08:10.320
- I'm gonna lose behind this.
- Easy, Tommy.

08:10.468 --> 08:12.890
We always figured they'd
pull some last-minute shit.

08:13.038 --> 08:14.326
At least now we know
what it is.

08:14.474 --> 08:16.161
Fuck.

08:16.310 --> 08:19.399
I want you to remember,
you're representing your daddy.

08:19.548 --> 08:20.869
Yeah, I know.

08:21.017 --> 08:22.371
What she wanna
see us for, anyway?

08:22.519 --> 08:24.507
Maybe she got somethin'
special in mind for you, boy.

08:24.654 --> 08:27.511
- Cool.
- She's a Barksdale.

08:27.659 --> 08:29.613
She know talent
when she sees it.

08:29.761 --> 08:33.119
Besides, they owe
this family a lot.

08:33.265 --> 08:35.154
Your daddy,
he stood tall for them.

08:35.302 --> 08:36.857
I know, I know.
He a soldier.

08:37.005 --> 08:40.306
- Like father, like son.
- No doubt.

08:43.548 --> 08:46.069
- What time you got?
- 3:30.

08:46.218 --> 08:48.873
Motherfucker late.

08:49.021 --> 08:50.512
Yo.

08:52.292 --> 08:55.383
It's for you, Marlo.

08:55.530 --> 08:58.286
Yeah, speak.

08:58.434 --> 09:01.257
You on it.

09:01.405 --> 09:03.397
As long as she hit
her mark, we straight.

09:06.512 --> 09:10.236
What time I gotta pick up
that skinny girl?

09:10.384 --> 09:12.079
A'ight.

09:15.224 --> 09:17.012
So what time they say?

09:17.160 --> 09:19.682
Tomorrow night.

09:19.830 --> 09:23.354
She be on the 8:45
from New York. Yeah.

09:23.502 --> 09:25.490
We can take care of that.

09:25.639 --> 09:27.293
No. I'll do it.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.962
Don't want nothin'
to go wrong.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.733
You sure about that?

09:31.880 --> 09:35.938
It's a'ight.
You can hang back on this.

09:36.086 --> 09:40.110
Yeah, I think I got
this one, too.

09:40.258 --> 09:41.746
Marlo Stanfield.

09:41.895 --> 09:44.449
He ain't so much.

09:44.598 --> 09:47.186
Using cell phones and shit.

09:47.334 --> 09:50.099
What's he sayin' now?

09:53.075 --> 09:56.169
"What time I gotta
pick up the skinny girl?

10:00.553 --> 10:01.987
I do it.

10:04.692 --> 10:08.449
Don't want nothing
to go wrong."

10:08.597 --> 10:10.451
Maybe he's picking up
a girlfriend?

10:10.600 --> 10:15.325
"Skinny girl from New York"?
It's code. Cocaine.

10:15.472 --> 10:18.863
Damn. For Marlo himself
to get near a package...

10:19.011 --> 10:21.434
He's a mope. I told ya.

10:21.582 --> 10:24.069
- So what do we do about it?
- We work up some counter lit.

10:24.218 --> 10:25.839
That's why we have
a printer on retainer.

10:25.987 --> 10:28.242
Best if we run down
the original photograph.

10:28.390 --> 10:29.811
If we can prove
this one's a fake--

10:29.959 --> 10:31.681
I didn't work at "Sun" Papers
for 22 damn years

10:31.829 --> 10:33.216
not to know somebody.

10:33.364 --> 10:35.052
I'm gonna call Paul McCardle
at the photo library.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.555
And if we still
can't find it?

10:36.702 --> 10:38.189
Then we put out
a fake photo of our own.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.993
Show Royce in a motel
with a dead girl and a live boy.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.563
We can't sling mud back.
Not this late.

10:43.712 --> 10:45.399
Relax. I'm kidding.

10:45.547 --> 10:48.204
You get back on your schedule.
Hit all your stops.

10:48.351 --> 10:51.608
Go to that donors' dinner
tonight and make nice.

10:51.756 --> 10:54.778
We'll take care of this.

10:54.927 --> 10:56.714
You can't do this to us.

10:56.863 --> 10:58.584
Bey took the weight
for all y'all.

10:58.732 --> 11:00.353
And you've been
amply compensated.

11:00.501 --> 11:02.655
- But time moves on.
- Not for Bey, it don't.

11:02.803 --> 11:05.461
What I meant to say is there's
no more money coming in.

11:05.608 --> 11:06.895
No more business.

11:07.044 --> 11:09.399
Avon is gone.
So are his people.

11:09.546 --> 11:11.235
Shit.

11:11.383 --> 11:13.578
You seem to still be doin'
all right for yourself.

11:15.088 --> 11:17.275
There's nothing more
I can do for you.

11:17.424 --> 11:20.448
Bey know everything.
You forget that?

11:20.596 --> 11:22.617
And what's he gonna do?
Who's he gonna tell?

11:22.766 --> 11:25.187
And what do I care
if he does?

11:25.335 --> 11:27.524
Bey never heard me say
a damn thing about business.

11:27.672 --> 11:29.292
What about your brother?

11:29.441 --> 11:32.230
Avon could be gone longer
if Bey gets to speakin' his mind.

11:32.377 --> 11:34.437
I couldn't care less
about Avon.

11:38.820 --> 11:42.378
The thing is I wanted
you both to hear it from me

11:42.525 --> 11:45.815
so there ain't no lies
from here on in.

11:45.962 --> 11:47.817
She even paid enough
over the last two years

11:47.965 --> 11:51.188
that you should have enough
money going forward, son.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.593
Your father has not been
disrespected here.

11:53.741 --> 11:55.963
You both got
what was coming.

11:56.110 --> 11:58.477
But ain't nothing
lasts forever.

12:03.220 --> 12:04.540
Jailhouse snitch?

12:04.688 --> 12:06.509
Called last overnight.
Worden talked to him.

12:06.658 --> 12:08.245
Says for a deal,
he can give us the case.

12:08.393 --> 12:11.383
- No shit.
- Gonna write up a writ,

12:11.532 --> 12:13.185
send it over
to the State's Attorney's office,

12:13.334 --> 12:15.589
get them to sign off on it
first thing tomorrow morning.

12:15.738 --> 12:18.359
- What's the rush?
- We jump on this.

12:18.508 --> 12:20.262
We cause a major shit stink
right before the election.

12:20.410 --> 12:22.432
If this guy really knows
why the witness-- what's-his-name?

12:22.579 --> 12:24.000
- Braddock.
- --was killed,

12:24.148 --> 12:26.271
might be bad for the mayor.

12:26.419 --> 12:28.006
If it's not bad
for the white boy, Carcetti.

12:28.155 --> 12:29.342
You care, either way?

12:29.490 --> 12:30.876
Fuck no. I don't give
a shit either way.

12:31.025 --> 12:32.312
I don't even vote.

12:32.459 --> 12:34.414
But it'll be fun to fuck
with them downtown suits.

12:34.563 --> 12:36.117
Maybe get you on the 1 1 :00 news.

12:36.265 --> 12:38.564
Get a little payback
for all that shit they put you through.

12:42.941 --> 12:45.364
With only two days left
before the primary,

12:45.512 --> 12:47.900
campaign officials
traded charges today

12:48.047 --> 12:50.136
over a controversial
flier distributed

12:50.284 --> 12:52.406
in some African-American
neighborhoods.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.776
What seemed to be a secure lead
for the incumbent mayor

12:54.923 --> 12:57.178
has evaporated in recent days.

12:57.327 --> 12:59.650
The latest "Sun"-WQMD poll

12:59.798 --> 13:02.420
shows the two men
in a virtual dead heat

13:02.568 --> 13:04.589
with Councilman
Tony Gray trailing.

13:04.738 --> 13:08.028
4% of the likely voters
are still undecided,

13:08.176 --> 13:09.906
and with the prim--

13:13.383 --> 13:15.204
I can't wait
for it to be over.

13:15.352 --> 13:18.008
Yeah, me either.

13:18.156 --> 13:20.147
Can that flier hurt you?

13:22.328 --> 13:24.083
You know, we found
the original photo

13:24.231 --> 13:25.919
in "The Sun"'s files.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.922
They grafted my puss
onto some perp-walk shot

13:29.070 --> 13:30.459
on the courthouse steps.

13:30.606 --> 13:32.194
I'm standing where some
sheriff's deputy was.

13:32.342 --> 13:33.897
Oh my God.

13:34.044 --> 13:35.799
What a nasty business.

13:35.947 --> 13:37.635
Royce is swearing
he had nothing to do with it.

13:37.782 --> 13:40.738
Claims it must've been
somebody freelancing.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.674
Well, Norman and Terri
say not to worry.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.443
It's all in the game.

13:44.592 --> 13:47.181
You know, when I was
15 points behind,

13:47.330 --> 13:50.618
I was resigned,
you know?

13:50.767 --> 13:53.289
A landslide,
I could live with that.

13:53.438 --> 13:55.126
I mean, what else did
anyone expect, anyway?

13:55.273 --> 13:58.129
White guy runnin'
for mayor in Baltimore?

13:58.277 --> 13:59.905
But this?

14:01.549 --> 14:04.505
Jen, if I lose this here
by two points, it's gonna kill me.

14:04.653 --> 14:07.555
It's gonna just fucking kill me.

14:13.932 --> 14:15.987
You gonna have to
step up now, Nay.

14:16.135 --> 14:17.989
A'ight.

14:18.138 --> 14:20.093
Be the man of the family.

14:20.241 --> 14:22.996
You older than your daddy was
when he went out on the corner.

14:23.145 --> 14:24.398
That's what I been sayin'.

14:24.547 --> 14:26.135
Damn. He quit school.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.836
You ain't quittin' school.

14:27.984 --> 14:30.173
- Not yet.
- Ma.

14:30.321 --> 14:32.009
But you are goin' out
on your own.

14:32.156 --> 14:34.946
You gonna ask Bodie
for a package.

14:35.093 --> 14:37.083
What if he say no?

14:37.231 --> 14:39.419
I ain't take
no for an answer.

14:39.566 --> 14:43.424
- Just did.
- What you mean?

14:43.571 --> 14:47.441
- From Brianna.
- Hand me the damn phone.

14:50.415 --> 14:52.604
What she say about you already
gettin' paid enough money?

14:52.752 --> 14:55.875
She a lyin' bitch, Namond.
You see?

14:56.023 --> 14:58.890
There's a lot about this world
you just don't know.

15:01.296 --> 15:05.253
What it come down to is
she know you ain't gonna snitch.

15:05.402 --> 15:08.426
- No matter what shit she pull.
- She got that right.

15:08.574 --> 15:12.198
She takin' advantage of you, Bey.
She takin' advantage of you.

15:12.346 --> 15:15.302
Sound like she got it all figured.

15:15.449 --> 15:17.070
Bitch got it figured out, all right.

15:17.219 --> 15:19.172
She cuttin' us loose
without notice. Nothin'.

15:19.321 --> 15:22.477
Like comin' home,
findin' our shit in the street, Bey.

15:22.625 --> 15:25.749
She don't give a fuck
about you, Avon, none of it.

15:25.897 --> 15:27.751
She had the nerve
to talk to me on this,

15:27.900 --> 15:30.155
Iike she gonna
set things straight

15:30.303 --> 15:32.101
so I don't tell no lies.

15:44.122 --> 15:45.409
Jen, I'm sorry.

15:45.557 --> 15:47.078
He said he'd be up.

15:47.227 --> 15:49.581
He's already gone
to the office.

15:49.729 --> 15:52.185
Well, what's he doing there?

15:52.333 --> 15:54.588
He couldn't sleep.
He's been there for hours.

15:54.736 --> 15:57.137
Aw, shit. See ya.

16:02.113 --> 16:04.269
And given that we still
have a shortage of officers

16:04.416 --> 16:06.772
willing to work secondary
at the polling stations,

16:06.919 --> 16:08.574
we're asking
for anyone interested

16:08.722 --> 16:11.211
to contact Tactical
this afternoon.

16:11.358 --> 16:13.781
Next order of business:
fresh warrants,

16:13.930 --> 16:15.684
beginning with murder
and weapons charges

16:15.833 --> 16:17.921
on one Omar Little.

16:18.069 --> 16:19.956
Anyone know this mutt?

16:20.105 --> 16:23.127
Oh, yeah!

16:23.276 --> 16:25.530
- Who'd he kill?
- Some lady in a store.

16:25.678 --> 16:27.867
- Reads like a taxpayer.
- A taxpayer?

16:28.015 --> 16:29.971
From what this says,
he's charged with felony homicide,

16:30.118 --> 16:31.906
to wit: murder in the commission
of a robbery.

16:32.054 --> 16:34.143
About fuckin' time someone got
some paper on that motherfucker.

16:34.291 --> 16:37.747
Anyhow, we got no fixed
address, no known abode.

16:37.895 --> 16:39.150
But if apprehended,

16:39.297 --> 16:41.820
contact Detectives Holley
and Crutchfield in Homicide.

16:41.967 --> 16:43.155
You wanna find Omar Little?

16:43.303 --> 16:45.490
You look for a corner boy
running away from a corner

16:45.638 --> 16:47.231
with shit in his pants.

16:50.679 --> 16:54.103
You ever know Omar
to do a citizen?

16:54.251 --> 16:56.617
Anyway, pass these around.

17:06.135 --> 17:08.255
- Jesus, Tommy.
- I spent a couple hours

17:08.403 --> 17:10.258
going over the latest data,
rearranged the schedule.

17:10.406 --> 17:11.493
Tommy.
A little bit of knowledge--

17:11.641 --> 17:13.262
There's a bunch
of middle class black precincts

17:13.410 --> 17:15.431
which are strong on Tony
but still have a high undecided.

17:15.579 --> 17:17.067
I think we can
pick up some votes--

17:17.214 --> 17:19.171
Those people hate the mayor.
You're gonna get those votes,

17:19.318 --> 17:21.807
- and if you don't, Gray will.
- We go door to door today.

17:21.955 --> 17:23.710
As long as they
don't go to Royce.

17:23.858 --> 17:25.413
I need some black votes
if I'm gonna be mayor.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.080
I need some kind of mandate
from that community.

17:27.229 --> 17:29.217
If I sneak in with a bare plurality...

17:29.366 --> 17:31.453
We might just win this thing.

17:31.602 --> 17:32.789
What do you think
kept me up all night?

17:32.937 --> 17:35.426
With all due respect
to your early-morning analysis,

17:35.575 --> 17:39.065
we got three back-to-back
drive-time radio interviews

17:39.213 --> 17:40.767
I wore out
my kneepads to get.

17:40.916 --> 17:43.404
The people running your campaign
are professionals, Tommy.

17:43.552 --> 17:47.109
Don't try this shit at home.

17:47.256 --> 17:48.844
You know, there might
just be a job for you

17:48.992 --> 17:50.847
in a Carcetti administration--

17:50.994 --> 17:52.750
press secretary, chief of staff.

17:52.898 --> 17:55.163
Oh, get in the fucking car.

17:58.639 --> 18:00.860
Duquan?

18:01.009 --> 18:02.563
Mr. Prez.

18:02.711 --> 18:04.398
Can you come
with me, please?

18:04.546 --> 18:06.606
What'd I do?

18:16.363 --> 18:19.094
Get here early.
I'll let you in, and you can shower.

18:23.005 --> 18:26.329
My dirty clothes?

18:26.478 --> 18:30.000
Put 'em in this bag,
leave 'em in the locker.

18:30.149 --> 18:33.472
I'll bring 'em home
and wash 'em.

18:33.621 --> 18:37.080
Go ahead and get cleaned up.
You'll be late for class.

18:54.314 --> 18:56.545
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Monnel.

18:58.589 --> 18:59.774
Skanky ho.

18:59.923 --> 19:01.210
Damn, she good, though.

19:01.358 --> 19:02.779
Yeah yeah.
You right about that.

19:02.926 --> 19:04.747
Hey, yo, Tiff, baby.
I got 50¢ too.

19:04.896 --> 19:06.383
Fuck y'all.

19:06.532 --> 19:08.786
Damn. All three at once?
You know she could.

19:08.934 --> 19:11.233
I know you could.

19:15.912 --> 19:18.176
- Sir.
- At ease.

19:20.117 --> 19:23.641
Man, I hate it when the bosses
creep below the eighth floor.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.485
Yeah, well, I need a moment
just to unclench my asshole.

19:31.199 --> 19:33.788
- Sir?
- The Braddock investigation.

19:33.935 --> 19:35.857
It's coming. Norris and Greggs
are wringing it out.

19:36.006 --> 19:37.293
I fuckin' know it's coming.

19:37.441 --> 19:39.328
Commissioner Burrell
had a visit first thing this morning

19:39.477 --> 19:40.864
from State's Attorney
Demper himself,

19:41.012 --> 19:43.333
asking why one day
before the primary

19:43.482 --> 19:46.406
our detectives were trying
to writ out a jailhouse snitch.

19:46.554 --> 19:48.075
The tip came when it did.

19:48.222 --> 19:50.277
I didn't push it,
and I didn't hold it back either.

19:50.425 --> 19:51.912
Let the chips fall
where they may.

19:52.061 --> 19:53.515
Exactly, sir.

19:53.663 --> 19:56.385
Sergeant?
Fuck your falling chips.

19:56.533 --> 19:58.588
If Braddock was killed
because he was a witness

19:58.737 --> 20:00.958
and we break the case
one day before the primary,

20:01.106 --> 20:04.997
Royce hates us forever--
and Royce might win the election.

20:05.146 --> 20:07.234
If Braddock was killed
for any other reason

20:07.382 --> 20:08.669
and we break it today,

20:08.817 --> 20:12.374
then Carcetti hates our guts--
and Carcetti could win.

20:12.521 --> 20:15.048
I see your point.

20:16.761 --> 20:19.284
Tactical tells me
we're still about 20 bodies short

20:19.431 --> 20:21.119
for manning
the polling places.

20:21.268 --> 20:24.090
I want you to detail
two detectives

20:24.238 --> 20:26.293
to uniformed
election duty immediately.

20:26.441 --> 20:28.829
Lemme guess:
Norris and Greggs.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.398
Sounds good.

20:30.546 --> 20:32.368
They're to report
to Tactical at 1 300 today

20:32.516 --> 20:35.373
for election orientation.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.742
They can pick up
their writ

20:37.890 --> 20:40.078
and talk to their snitch
on Wednesday.

20:40.227 --> 20:42.649
American democracy.

20:42.797 --> 20:46.220
Let's show those
Third-World fucks how it's done.

20:46.368 --> 20:47.996
Yes, sir.

20:51.142 --> 20:55.366
I have what I think is
some very good news for all of you.

20:55.514 --> 20:57.403
We're going
to be implementing

20:57.551 --> 21:00.073
the University of Maryland
pilot program.

21:00.220 --> 21:01.875
You're only taking
three of my knuckleheads?

21:02.023 --> 21:03.943
A total of 10 children
from the eighth grade

21:04.092 --> 21:07.114
in this first class--
eight boys and two girls.

21:07.263 --> 21:09.452
- If things go well...
- It's a start.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.587
- When?
- This morning.

21:11.736 --> 21:14.467
Hallelujah.
Not a moment too soon.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.231
- How was l?
- Good on Steiner.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.600
Better on the A.M. talk shows.

21:20.747 --> 21:23.037
I thought you handled that call
about the fliers well.

21:23.184 --> 21:26.810
Fucking Royce.
If I lose because of this bullshit--

21:26.957 --> 21:29.145
You lose, we can blame it
on 10 different things.

21:29.293 --> 21:31.147
Same thing if you win.

21:31.296 --> 21:33.518
Guess who I just
got off the phone with?

21:33.666 --> 21:36.021
State Senator Davis.
He wants a meet.

21:36.170 --> 21:40.260
Clay Davis? Why would I wanna get
into bed with that motherfucker?

21:40.409 --> 21:41.930
He didn't actually
come out and say it,

21:42.079 --> 21:43.465
but it sounds
like he's ready to follow Watkins

21:43.614 --> 21:44.834
and jump the mayor's ship.

21:44.982 --> 21:46.069
What's he want in return?

21:46.216 --> 21:48.605
Shee-it. Same thing
he always wants.

21:48.754 --> 21:51.509
At least 20k to his favorite
campaign committee is my guess.

21:51.657 --> 21:53.611
Maybe even 30,
'cause you know Clay ain't cheap.

21:53.760 --> 21:56.751
Well, I'm not promising him
anything policy-wise.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.755
You think Clay Davis
gives a fuck about policy?

21:59.903 --> 22:01.556
Naw, this is strictly
for services rendered.

22:01.704 --> 22:03.426
He might be conning us--

22:03.574 --> 22:05.194
taking the money,
then sitting on his hands.

22:05.343 --> 22:09.166
Maybe. But then all
we have to lose is money.

22:09.315 --> 22:12.203
Could be the extra little push
we need on the West Side.

22:12.351 --> 22:14.808
Set it up.

22:14.957 --> 22:16.611
I already did.

22:16.759 --> 22:19.681
- lnvert the denominator--
- What invert mean?

22:19.828 --> 22:22.185
The numerator
and the denominator switch places.

22:22.332 --> 22:25.088
- Turn upside down.
- Why you do that?

22:25.236 --> 22:27.591
Because it works.
That's the formula.

22:27.739 --> 22:29.728
Excuse me,
Mr. Pryzbylewski.

22:29.877 --> 22:34.201
Namond Brice, Darnell Tyson
and Zenobia Dawson.

22:34.349 --> 22:36.471
Grab your things
and come with us, please.

22:36.619 --> 22:39.809
- Ooh!
- Quiet, quiet.

22:39.957 --> 22:41.844
Calm down, please.

22:41.993 --> 22:44.314
- What'd we do? We in trouble?
- Just come with me.

22:44.462 --> 22:46.852
Shit. It's the story of my life.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.220
They ain't coming back.

22:48.369 --> 22:50.256
Yo, Mr. Prezbo,
they gettin' arrested?

22:50.404 --> 22:51.735
No...

22:54.043 --> 22:55.797
Yo, Nay,
can I have your Xbox?

22:55.945 --> 22:57.500
'Cause you ain't gonna
need it where you are.

22:57.647 --> 22:58.768
What'd they do?

22:58.915 --> 23:01.404
Markeith, Kwame
and Latonya.

23:01.553 --> 23:03.508
Bring your things
and come with us.

23:03.656 --> 23:06.212
Ooh!

23:06.360 --> 23:08.761
Again?

23:28.622 --> 23:30.310
You know I can't
publicly endorse you.

23:30.459 --> 23:31.946
Not at this late hour.

23:32.093 --> 23:33.548
Then what are
we talking about?

23:33.696 --> 23:36.753
I lay back and not do
what I usually do on election day.

23:36.901 --> 23:38.322
I see you all get a push

23:38.470 --> 23:40.224
in the Seventh
and Ninth Districts, say,

23:40.373 --> 23:43.428
and maybe that piece
of the 1 1th west of Freemont.

23:43.577 --> 23:45.398
I split some
of my tickets for y'all.

23:45.546 --> 23:47.535
I split my walkaround money.

23:47.682 --> 23:50.311
You know,
the usual to-and-fro.

24:01.033 --> 24:02.755
Politics is
a good thing, pardner.

24:02.903 --> 24:04.291
That's a minority opinion.

24:04.439 --> 24:06.192
Let's order.

24:06.340 --> 24:09.865
I'm hungry enough to eat
the horse you rode in on.

24:10.014 --> 24:13.403
If you don't mind,
we're a little busy

24:13.552 --> 24:16.507
- for a sit-down lunch.
- Oh, no doubt.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.523
Just leave enough
for the tab.

24:49.334 --> 24:50.486
Naw, she crazy.

24:50.635 --> 24:51.989
She says you were there.

24:52.137 --> 24:53.758
I wasn't. Besides,
it wasn't even rape.

24:53.906 --> 24:55.996
- She wanted to.
- How do you know? You weren't there.

24:56.143 --> 24:57.163
I saw her go in with them.

24:57.311 --> 24:59.533
Go in with who?

24:59.681 --> 25:01.035
This is no time
to play, young man.

25:01.184 --> 25:03.337
You are in very serious trouble.

25:03.486 --> 25:05.975
Who did you see her go
in the boys' bathroom with?

25:06.123 --> 25:07.644
Paul and Monnel.

25:07.792 --> 25:10.581
Paul and Monnel?
And what were you doing?

25:10.729 --> 25:12.618
- Lookout.
- So you were involved.

25:12.765 --> 25:13.853
But I didn't even see
what happened.

25:14.001 --> 25:14.954
You were standing guard.

25:15.103 --> 25:16.657
No, listen,
Monnel gave me $5

25:16.805 --> 25:19.293
and just told me to stand by the door
and holler if someone came.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.697
This isn't even fair.
I didn't even do nothing.

25:21.844 --> 25:23.565
You stood lookout
while two eighth-grade boys

25:23.713 --> 25:24.968
raped an eighth-grade girl.

25:25.115 --> 25:26.036
But she wanted to.

25:26.184 --> 25:28.004
That's not what Tiffanie says.

25:28.153 --> 25:30.442
There'll be an investigation.
You'll be suspended.

25:30.591 --> 25:32.244
You could very well be expelled,

25:32.393 --> 25:34.714
maybe even face criminal charges.

25:34.863 --> 25:36.216
Mrs. Donnely, please don't.

25:36.364 --> 25:37.851
Mrs. Donnely, please don't
call my foster mother.

25:37.999 --> 25:39.621
I'll tell you everything
I know about this.

25:39.769 --> 25:40.889
I know all about it already.

25:41.038 --> 25:42.391
No, but I know
some other stuff,

25:42.539 --> 25:44.393
Iike who been thieving
from the teachers' lounge,

25:44.541 --> 25:46.364
or tagging gym lockers, or even...

25:46.512 --> 25:48.066
- Miss Jeffries, please.
- Miss Donnelly, please...

25:48.215 --> 25:49.868
This is Mrs. Donnelly
calling from Tilghman Middle.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.738
Listen... I know...

25:51.886 --> 25:53.607
remember, the boy who cut
Mr. Philmont's tires?

25:53.754 --> 25:55.916
I know who did that.

25:57.060 --> 25:58.584
I know about a murder.

26:00.030 --> 26:01.429
I do.

26:06.572 --> 26:09.228
We've identified certain students

26:09.376 --> 26:12.199
we feel will benefit
from the special curriculum

26:12.347 --> 26:14.669
and the smaller class size.

26:14.816 --> 26:16.872
We've chosen 10 students
from the eighth grade

26:17.019 --> 26:19.577
to participate in this program.

26:19.724 --> 26:20.944
You get chose,
you got to go?

26:21.093 --> 26:24.015
- That's right.
- What if you don't wanna?

26:24.162 --> 26:25.584
It's mandatory.

26:25.732 --> 26:29.789
We feel that this program
will benefit everyone.

26:29.937 --> 26:33.527
You'll get the attention you need.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.110
And we outta
everybody else' shit.

26:36.447 --> 26:38.735
My bad.
I ain't mean to curse.

26:38.883 --> 26:40.371
Yeah, but you're right, though.

26:40.518 --> 26:43.342
This class get tore up,
it's only on y'all.

26:43.489 --> 26:47.814
- So we get put outta class.
- This is a classroom, too.

26:47.961 --> 26:51.353
And every one of you
has proven time and again

26:51.501 --> 26:55.525
that you're not ready
for a regular classroom.

26:55.674 --> 26:59.863
But this is a new program
that if you work it

27:00.011 --> 27:03.102
is going to make you ready.

27:03.249 --> 27:05.004
Ready for gen pop.

27:05.152 --> 27:08.843
This is prison, yo.
And we in solitary an' shit.

27:08.991 --> 27:11.119
- Word.
- Solitary.

27:12.662 --> 27:17.087
That's good, son.
This is solitary.

27:17.235 --> 27:19.704
This is the hole
up in here.

27:25.381 --> 27:28.871
He's a good kid.
He really is.

27:29.018 --> 27:31.507
And once you make that call,
his name's gonna be in the system.

27:31.655 --> 27:34.744
What can I do?
He says he knows about a murder.

27:34.892 --> 27:37.148
I have to notify police on this.

27:37.296 --> 27:39.766
At least let me call
someone I trust.

28:13.246 --> 28:14.567
That's him right there.

28:14.714 --> 28:17.103
Stand by. You don't wanna
be in on the collar?

28:17.251 --> 28:20.073
Nah. If you take it, he'll think
it's a straight interdiction,

28:20.221 --> 28:22.712
and I get to surprise him
at the bail review.

28:24.294 --> 28:26.148
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:26.296 --> 28:27.549
Can I have your attention?

28:27.698 --> 28:31.055
Now boarding at
gate letter D, track 4,

28:31.204 --> 28:35.995
the southbound
8:45 Acela Express from New York,

28:36.143 --> 28:38.966
making station stops
at BWl Rail Station

28:39.114 --> 28:43.272
and Union Station, Washington.

28:43.419 --> 28:45.142
Sister, help you
with your bag?

28:45.290 --> 28:47.911
- No, thank you.
- Don't be afraid.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.348
What should I be afraid?
Who are you?

28:50.497 --> 28:52.017
Just walk you to the door.

28:52.165 --> 28:54.053
My husband
is waiting outside.

28:54.202 --> 28:55.422
Like to meet him.

28:55.570 --> 28:57.191
I'll wait with you,
make sure you're safe.

28:57.338 --> 28:59.594
That really
won't be necessary.

28:59.741 --> 29:02.265
- Amtrak police, sir.
- Could you step over here please?

29:02.413 --> 29:05.169
- What is this?
- Give me the bag.

29:05.317 --> 29:07.137
What is going on?

29:07.286 --> 29:09.846
I don't know this man.
Where are you taking me?

29:14.229 --> 29:17.352
- What'd he say about it?
- Nothing much.

29:17.501 --> 29:19.488
Drugs?

29:19.637 --> 29:23.394
I didn't question him
too close.

29:23.541 --> 29:26.230
A murder.

29:26.379 --> 29:27.632
I should
take it downtown.

29:27.780 --> 29:29.302
Who knows
what he really knows?

29:29.449 --> 29:33.475
I just-- I don't want to see him
get chewed up by the system.

29:33.622 --> 29:36.311
Let me try
to keep this close,

29:36.460 --> 29:39.849
give it to someone with
a little bit of discretion.

29:39.998 --> 29:41.551
Appreciate it.

29:41.699 --> 29:43.921
- Carver.
- Carver?

29:44.068 --> 29:45.390
Ellis has come a long way.

29:45.538 --> 29:48.427
I think he'd be right for this.

29:48.576 --> 29:52.466
Why do you care?
And what's this kid to you?

29:52.614 --> 29:54.102
I don't know.

29:54.250 --> 29:57.447
He's one of my students.

30:01.726 --> 30:03.715
Sergeant.

30:03.862 --> 30:06.153
Clean. Both of 'em.

30:06.300 --> 30:07.654
Say what?

30:07.802 --> 30:09.891
Nothing in that bag
but ladies clothes.

30:10.038 --> 30:13.027
Nothing dirty
on either one of 'em.

30:13.176 --> 30:16.305
Unless you got another idea,
we gotta cut 'em loose.

30:21.454 --> 30:24.343
From what he says,
he was just a go-between.

30:24.491 --> 30:26.079
He delivered a message.

30:26.228 --> 30:29.117
He told the victim to be
at a certain place at a certain time.

30:29.265 --> 30:30.718
Then how does he know?

30:30.867 --> 30:32.822
He says everyone knows
what happened to Lex.

30:32.970 --> 30:34.990
It's in the streets.

30:35.139 --> 30:36.626
This other thing at the school.

30:36.773 --> 30:38.831
I swear I didn't
do it, Miss Anna.

30:38.978 --> 30:40.632
I didn't do it.
You'll see.

30:40.780 --> 30:43.937
School's gonna look into that,
we're gonna look into this.

30:44.085 --> 30:47.842
As long as Randy cooperates,
tells everybody the truth--

30:47.991 --> 30:50.779
- But if word got out--
- Understand.

30:50.928 --> 30:53.716
That's why he's gonna go to school,
keep his mouth shut,

30:53.865 --> 30:57.755
his nose clean,
go about his business.

30:57.903 --> 31:01.094
Child's shown such bad judgment
in both instances.

31:01.241 --> 31:02.629
Agreed.

31:02.777 --> 31:05.770
But from what I can tell,
he's not a bad kid.

31:47.504 --> 31:49.693
Dennis?

31:49.841 --> 31:51.396
Where you goin'
at so early?

31:51.544 --> 31:54.200
Oh, I'm gonna go run,
and then I got lawn work later.

31:54.348 --> 31:56.001
You comin' back, right?

31:56.149 --> 31:59.051
What you mean
am I comin' back?

32:00.121 --> 32:02.211
It's gonna be
like that, huh?

32:02.360 --> 32:04.590
What do you mean?
Like what?

33:20.231 --> 33:22.087
- Where to?
- Highlandtown.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.896
Flush out yo' base,
little trooper.

33:35.185 --> 33:38.676
- What up, Spider?
- Hey, shorty.

33:38.824 --> 33:40.546
Thank you, but I know
how I'm voting.

33:40.693 --> 33:42.981
I'm gonna
be late for work.

33:43.129 --> 33:44.450
Miss Anna, is it okay
if I stand out here

33:44.599 --> 33:46.319
while you go vote?

33:46.467 --> 33:49.156
- Don't you go nowhere, boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:49.304 --> 33:52.060
So, what up, man?
So, how much they payin' you for this?

33:52.208 --> 33:55.165
They say like 40, but I gotta work
the whole day though.

33:55.313 --> 33:56.266
Know what I mean?

33:56.414 --> 33:58.279
Yo, Spider.

34:04.092 --> 34:05.178
Yo, that was Spider, right?

34:05.326 --> 34:06.725
- Yeah.
- Well, where'd he go?

34:09.398 --> 34:11.652
No, thank you, man.
I can't vote.

34:11.802 --> 34:14.291
Conviction? Felony?

34:14.438 --> 34:15.926
Move on, man.

34:16.074 --> 34:17.696
A'ight, man.

34:17.842 --> 34:20.632
You see Spider again, you tell him
he need to come past my gym.

34:20.780 --> 34:23.603
He ain't been round in weeks,
and we need to talk. A'ight?

34:23.751 --> 34:26.206
A'ight.

34:26.355 --> 34:29.011
- Where's the older kid?
- I don't know.

34:29.159 --> 34:30.146
- Okay. You're hired.

34:30.295 --> 34:32.764
Shove one of those
into every hand you can.

34:37.670 --> 34:39.902
Thank you very much.

34:45.949 --> 34:47.370
Why you ain't at school?

34:47.516 --> 34:48.806
Ain't no school today.

34:48.953 --> 34:51.775
- One them Jew holidays?
- Election.

34:51.922 --> 34:55.547
- So what you gonna do?
- Dunno. Hang.

34:55.695 --> 34:57.483
What'd I say
about steppin' up?

34:57.631 --> 35:01.222
Brianna turn off the faucet.
We gotta make some rain.

35:01.370 --> 35:04.204
I'm gonna get dressed.
We go see Bodie.

35:12.751 --> 35:15.340
Kid, I got
something else for you.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.709
Put one of these
in every door

35:16.858 --> 35:18.278
between the expressway
and Winchester,

35:18.426 --> 35:19.881
and from Freemont to Fulton.

35:20.029 --> 35:22.083
You can do it by yourself
or you can get some friends,

35:22.232 --> 35:24.653
but I'm gonna come past
this afternoon, make sure it's done.

35:24.801 --> 35:26.156
Okay. One in
each door. Cool.

35:26.303 --> 35:29.025
This is
for the day's work.

35:29.174 --> 35:30.461
- Whoa.

35:30.609 --> 35:33.199
That's your walk-around.
But don't you fail me.

35:33.347 --> 35:36.035
Took forever.
What's all this, son?

35:36.184 --> 35:39.440
Man said if I put
these fliers in doors, I can get paid.

35:39.589 --> 35:41.576
I come right home after.

35:41.724 --> 35:43.312
You right you will.

35:43.459 --> 35:45.081
You ain't
in these streets no more.

35:45.230 --> 35:48.352
No, ma'am.

35:48.501 --> 35:50.903
Sounds like she mean it.

35:53.106 --> 35:54.828
"11 :00 News," huh?

35:54.976 --> 35:56.497
Shut up.

35:56.645 --> 35:57.999
I'm on this shit detail

35:58.148 --> 36:00.102
because you wanted
to stir the pot.

36:00.250 --> 36:03.072
And tomorrow, if we bust open
the Braddock case,

36:03.220 --> 36:04.908
nobody's gonna give a fuck.

36:05.057 --> 36:06.077
Life is timing.

36:06.225 --> 36:08.625
No shit, fucknuts.

36:12.734 --> 36:14.422
Tommy Carcetti.
How you doing?

36:14.569 --> 36:16.925
- He's a cute one.
- Thanks.

36:17.073 --> 36:18.560
Hey, Tommy Carcetti.
Hope you're voting today.

36:18.709 --> 36:20.029
I am.

36:20.177 --> 36:21.599
Well, who's it gonna be?
Give me a hint. Come on.

36:21.746 --> 36:22.867
Don't keep me
in suspense.

36:23.015 --> 36:24.135
You don't have
to worry about me.

36:24.284 --> 36:26.844
Appreciate it.

36:30.925 --> 36:32.580
Tommy Carcetti,
running for mayor.

36:32.728 --> 36:34.424
Nice to meet ya.

36:35.965 --> 36:37.921
- How much longer?
- I think we can wrap this up.

36:38.068 --> 36:39.523
We got a lot more
places to be today.

36:39.671 --> 36:41.325
Tommy Carcetti.
I knew your dad.

36:41.474 --> 36:42.927
First District Democratic Club.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.764
- No kidding.
- Just wanted to say you got my vote.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.401
- Thank you.
- They had their chance.

36:48.549 --> 36:50.236
Look what shape
the city's in.

36:50.384 --> 36:51.606
I'm hoping
to turn things around.

36:51.754 --> 36:52.840
Anyway, thanks for your support.

36:52.989 --> 36:54.910
I mean,
you expect politicians to steal.

36:55.059 --> 36:58.215
- I don't, actually.
- It's part of the game. I understand.

36:58.362 --> 37:01.619
But we took one dollar
outta every three, not two outta three,

37:01.768 --> 37:03.321
Iike these moolies.

37:03.469 --> 37:06.627
I mean, leave something
for the city, for Christ sake.

37:06.774 --> 37:11.232
Am I right?
Best of luck, Councilman.

37:11.381 --> 37:13.536
Moolies?

37:13.683 --> 37:15.777
Sorry.

37:17.790 --> 37:19.211
Election fliers?

37:19.358 --> 37:21.279
Yeah, just run up,
stick 'em in mailboxes,

37:21.427 --> 37:23.348
you know, screen doors,
whatever.

37:23.497 --> 37:25.718
- What about the vacants?
- We ain't even got to do the vacants.

37:25.867 --> 37:27.689
Shit. Some blocks
ain't nothing but.

37:27.836 --> 37:29.557
That's what I'm saying.
This be easy money.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.826
Don't wanna do it?

37:30.974 --> 37:32.261
- I do it.
- Me too.

37:32.409 --> 37:34.031
Yo, this shit'd
be easier if we had a car.

37:34.179 --> 37:36.733
Dang, Donut. I'm in enough trouble
with Miss Anna as is.

37:36.882 --> 37:38.770
So, what up, Mike?
You in?

37:38.918 --> 37:41.353
All right, then.

37:47.030 --> 37:48.885
Look, Namond's been--

37:49.032 --> 37:51.554
He been inconsistent.
You know sometimes he be doin' good,

37:51.702 --> 37:53.090
then other times, he just--

37:53.237 --> 37:55.560
We talked about that.
He gonna do better.

37:55.707 --> 37:58.630
Ain't you?

37:58.779 --> 38:00.333
Election day special,
two for two!

38:00.480 --> 38:02.537
- I don't know.
- Oh, I do.

38:02.684 --> 38:04.539
You gonna give this boy
his own package

38:04.687 --> 38:06.675
or there gonna be some drama.

38:06.823 --> 38:09.479
You want me to talk to Wee-Bey?
Maybe you wanna talk to him.

38:09.626 --> 38:11.548
I give you his number.
He got a cellphone.

38:11.696 --> 38:12.883
All that's not even necessary.

38:13.030 --> 38:14.719
I got all the respect
in the world for Bey.

38:14.868 --> 38:17.133
Then show some
for his family.

38:23.079 --> 38:26.072
Make me proud, hear?

38:37.465 --> 38:40.621
Damn, boy. Your mama's
what niggas call a dragon lady.

38:40.769 --> 38:43.191
She don't blink.

38:43.339 --> 38:44.659
Yeah, gimme some
insight, though.

38:44.808 --> 38:48.803
- To what?
- Why you is what you is.

39:12.880 --> 39:15.302
Yo. What up?
Where y'all goin'?

39:15.450 --> 39:16.938
Hungry, man.
I need to eat.

39:17.085 --> 39:18.439
Nah, come one.
Let's finish this.

39:18.586 --> 39:20.643
Nah, yo.
This shit is boring.

39:20.790 --> 39:22.913
- Fuck it.
- Listen, I ain't even gonna pay y'all

39:23.061 --> 39:24.548
if you don't finish
the job, so...

39:24.697 --> 39:26.450
You already
got the money?

39:26.599 --> 39:28.219
Fool, if the motherfucker
paid you out already,

39:28.368 --> 39:30.155
then why the hell
are we still here?

39:30.304 --> 39:31.691
'Cause this is the job.

39:31.839 --> 39:34.460
Shit, the man ain't got
nobody to blame but hisself.

39:34.609 --> 39:35.964
It's his fault
for payin' up front.

39:36.111 --> 39:38.100
Yo, you need to split
that money up or something

39:38.248 --> 39:40.717
'cause time is a-wastin'.

39:45.124 --> 39:47.285
Didn't even finish
the day's work.

39:49.096 --> 39:51.084
Get me something
at least.

39:51.231 --> 39:53.119
- Lake trout.
- Soda too?

39:53.268 --> 39:56.501
- Yeah. Strawberry.
- A'ight. I got ya.

40:27.082 --> 40:29.638
Hey. Where the crew at?

40:29.785 --> 40:31.239
Randy got 'em all some job

40:31.387 --> 40:32.942
handin' out election
fliers or whatever.

40:33.090 --> 40:34.410
You ain't wanna do that?

40:34.558 --> 40:38.415
Hell, no.
It's bullshit, man.

40:38.564 --> 40:40.985
- I got a job too.
- Word?

40:41.133 --> 40:43.790
Yeah, with Bodie.
I'm movin' the package.

40:43.938 --> 40:46.794
You wanna go
in on it with me?

40:46.942 --> 40:50.365
You sure?
We could work together.

40:50.513 --> 40:52.601
Nah, man,
that's your thing.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.837
Go do what you do.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.750
Yeah, a'ight.
I'm gonna holler at you.

41:08.938 --> 41:12.895
She a cute one,
ain't she?

41:13.044 --> 41:16.311
Yeah, boy. You know
I love the women.

41:22.557 --> 41:25.647
Hey, you seen Spider
around any?

41:25.795 --> 41:28.351
I mean, he ain't been
'round the gym in like a month, man.

41:28.499 --> 41:30.353
I leave messages,
he don't call.

41:30.502 --> 41:32.389
I don't understand, man.

41:32.538 --> 41:34.226
He was one
of my best welterweights.

41:34.373 --> 41:36.528
Now, why would he just
quit like that?

41:36.676 --> 41:39.578
Why don't you ask his moms?

41:43.352 --> 41:46.809
Well, shit. I was locked up
a good while, right.

41:46.956 --> 41:49.446
I mean
I ain't no angel.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.756
Naw. You ain't that.

42:01.210 --> 42:02.397
Thanks a lot, folks.

42:02.545 --> 42:04.533
Good job. Keep it up.
We're almost home.

42:04.682 --> 42:08.472
You're the best.
The best.

42:08.620 --> 42:09.774
Heavy turnout all around.

42:09.922 --> 42:11.676
Big lines on the West Side
might be bad for us.

42:11.824 --> 42:13.279
- I dunno but--
- Shh.

42:13.426 --> 42:15.548
We're out here
in West Baltimore,

42:15.696 --> 42:18.986
- the heart of his political base.
- This is today?

42:19.134 --> 42:20.756
This is live,
right now in Lafayette Square.

42:20.903 --> 42:22.291
Clay Davis just said
his whole organization

42:22.439 --> 42:24.528
was out going door-to-door
for Royce's ticket.

42:24.676 --> 42:26.164
So much for laying back
on the mayor.

42:26.311 --> 42:28.099
We paid $20,000
for this shit?

42:28.247 --> 42:30.936
He probably went to Royce
and shook him down for another 30.

42:31.084 --> 42:34.074
Motherfucker. Clay Davis
must know something we don't.

42:34.221 --> 42:37.411
He knows just enough
to get paid twice.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.482
Gotta blame ourselves
for payin' this thief up front.

42:39.629 --> 42:41.384
Hey, it was
worth a shot.

42:41.532 --> 42:44.093
Aides to the mayor have told me
privately that they are concerned...

42:46.605 --> 42:48.471
Thanks, yo.

42:54.617 --> 42:56.848
I'm-a get me a cold one.

43:29.664 --> 43:31.360
Grab the wall.

43:38.109 --> 43:39.736
Officer Walker.

43:48.690 --> 43:50.921
I ain't gonna be
out here strapped.

43:54.497 --> 43:56.898
Aw, you gonna
take that on a humble?

43:59.304 --> 44:01.394
Boy, you don't know there's
rules to this here game.

44:01.541 --> 44:03.696
- Rules?
- Yeah.

44:03.844 --> 44:05.904
Ugh!

44:14.759 --> 44:16.514
Where your shotgun at,
Mr. Omar?

44:16.662 --> 44:18.784
What is wrong with y'all, man?
Y'all ain't got no charges here.

44:18.932 --> 44:20.452
Charge is murder, motherfucker.

44:20.600 --> 44:22.822
Murder? Who I kill?

44:22.970 --> 44:24.791
Hey, Omar.

44:24.940 --> 44:27.528
- McNulty. What the hell goin' on here?
- You tell me.

44:27.676 --> 44:30.145
We got a warrant
for a robbery murder. In a store.

44:33.852 --> 44:35.684
Wagon's here.

44:43.364 --> 44:44.885
Hey, yo, McNulty,
I need a phone, yo.

44:45.033 --> 44:47.021
Fuck your phone.

44:47.170 --> 44:50.732
If I'm going to Booking,
I need to make a call tonight, yo.

44:55.415 --> 44:59.639
410-958-6612.

44:59.787 --> 45:02.086
An' let it ring.

45:04.627 --> 45:06.582
Here.

45:06.730 --> 45:08.718
- Hey.
- Yo, Butchie. I'm locked up, yo.

45:08.867 --> 45:10.086
What you need?
I got your bail.

45:10.234 --> 45:11.789
Nah, no bail.
They sayin' it's murder.

45:11.937 --> 45:14.497
Murder?
Well, don't worry. I got ya.

45:24.521 --> 45:26.614
You some
kinda Democrat or what?

45:29.294 --> 45:31.749
Voter turnout was heavy
all day across the city

45:31.897 --> 45:33.385
with some precincts
reporting lines

45:33.532 --> 45:35.688
as soon as the polls opened
at 7:00 this morning.

45:35.837 --> 45:37.958
Election officials, however,

45:38.106 --> 45:40.295
reported few problems
throughout the day.

45:40.443 --> 45:41.730
Now the polls have closed,

45:41.878 --> 45:43.533
officials at the Board
of Elections downtown

45:43.680 --> 45:47.071
have begun the tedious process
of tallying the vote,

45:47.219 --> 45:50.008
prepared for what could be
a long night.

45:50.155 --> 45:54.314
With just over half of the city's
316 precincts reporting,

45:54.462 --> 45:58.252
Councilman Thomas J. Carcetti
has a narrow lead of 2%.

45:58.400 --> 46:01.724
Traditionally, those precincts
that report latest

46:01.872 --> 46:03.727
tend to be
from West Baltimore,

46:03.875 --> 46:06.673
which is expected to favor
Mayor Royce in the late going.

46:15.191 --> 46:19.280
- How it go?
- Good. Nothin' to it.

46:19.429 --> 46:21.761
I'm countin' on you, Nay.

46:32.047 --> 46:35.036
Exit polls done earlier
in the day in key precincts

46:35.184 --> 46:38.408
show voters divided
over the challenges facing this city,

46:38.555 --> 46:40.889
such as crime
and education.

46:52.741 --> 46:54.797
...be quite an election.

46:54.944 --> 46:56.598
Since this race tightened
in the last couple of weeks,

46:56.746 --> 46:58.736
I've been saying
that this election

46:58.883 --> 47:01.239
would be won on the ground.

47:01.386 --> 47:03.742
And whoever has the best
field operations will take it.

47:03.891 --> 47:06.312
It's all about the turnout,
and this is something--

47:06.460 --> 47:07.948
What about Bond?

47:08.096 --> 47:11.352
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

47:11.499 --> 47:13.922
Yeah.

47:14.071 --> 47:18.161
All right.
Talk to you in a few.

47:18.310 --> 47:20.398
Bond's running really strong
against Demper.

47:20.546 --> 47:23.203
Looks like we might have
a new State's Attorney.

47:23.350 --> 47:25.171
What does that
mean for you?

47:25.319 --> 47:27.006
Well, Demper's Royce's boy.

47:27.155 --> 47:29.210
Dare to get
your hopes up, Tommy.

47:29.359 --> 47:33.483
You know what? Let's get
outta here for awhile,

47:33.632 --> 47:35.566
take a walk.

48:01.568 --> 48:03.595
I'll get your ass.

48:23.866 --> 48:26.622
- Pretty.
- A little ripe.

48:26.770 --> 48:30.027
Well, can't do anything about
the way the harbor smells.

48:30.174 --> 48:32.296
People are gonna
expect you to.

48:32.445 --> 48:34.465
I guess.

48:34.613 --> 48:35.867
You sound confident.

48:36.016 --> 48:37.882
I have a feeling.

48:45.462 --> 48:47.817
Could be a great city again.

48:47.965 --> 48:50.821
Pull some jobs in here.

48:50.970 --> 48:53.337
People move back,
fix up the houses.

48:55.477 --> 48:57.672
It's ringing again.

48:59.949 --> 49:01.336
Terri.

49:01.484 --> 49:02.838
Maybe you should answer it.

49:02.986 --> 49:04.707
I don't need an update
every five minutes.

49:04.856 --> 49:06.943
- No, we should go anyway.
- Do we have to?

49:07.091 --> 49:09.926
I'm sure they're frantic.
They don't know where you are.

49:13.199 --> 49:15.121
Yeah?

49:15.270 --> 49:18.068
Taking a walk with my wife.

49:24.382 --> 49:26.510
On our way.

49:33.394 --> 49:35.682
Royce is conceding.

49:35.831 --> 49:37.652
The West Side
precincts came in

49:37.801 --> 49:40.589
and we pulled two
outta five votes in some precincts.

49:40.738 --> 49:42.993
We stole his base.

49:43.141 --> 49:46.831
We won.

49:46.979 --> 49:49.278
Are we happy about that?

49:51.920 --> 49:54.241
I think so.

49:54.390 --> 49:57.345
I think we are.

49:57.494 --> 49:59.326
Yeah.

50:05.505 --> 50:06.802
You sure?

50:28.536 --> 50:30.699
Thank you.
Thank you.

50:36.981 --> 50:39.203
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Please.

50:39.352 --> 50:42.841
I want to thank you all
for your hard work and dedication.

50:42.989 --> 50:45.288
Give yourselves
a hand. Come on.

50:50.667 --> 50:53.256
I just got off the phone
with Mayor Royce and Councilman Gray.

50:53.404 --> 50:55.126
They were very gracious.
I asked for their help.

50:55.273 --> 50:57.265
I mean, we still have
a general election to win.

51:00.279 --> 51:02.400
Is there
a Republican candidate

51:02.549 --> 51:06.140
for mayor in Baltimore?
I don't know. I'm not sure.

51:06.289 --> 51:08.276
But, assuming that we win,
we still have--

51:08.424 --> 51:10.513
we still have a lot of work
to do to turn this city around,

51:10.661 --> 51:13.450
and we need everyone--
everyone who's willing to join us

51:13.598 --> 51:16.432
in making a better Baltimore
for our children.

51:21.375 --> 51:23.364
I don't want to make
a long speech. Believe me.

51:23.511 --> 51:24.932
You don't want to hear it.

51:25.081 --> 51:26.267
I don't want to make
a long speech,

51:26.416 --> 51:27.502
so I'll thank each
of you individually.

51:27.650 --> 51:29.242
But for tonight,
let's celebrate.

51:37.497 --> 51:39.489
Tommy! Tommy!

51:45.474 --> 51:46.929
How you doin'?

51:47.077 --> 51:48.798
Thanks. Hey.

51:48.945 --> 51:50.801
Damond.

51:50.948 --> 51:52.504
I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Mayor.

51:52.652 --> 51:54.072
Likewise.
And congratulations to you, too.

51:54.220 --> 51:57.744
- Thank you.
- I'm going home.

51:57.891 --> 51:59.378
No, come on. Stay.
I won't be long.

51:59.527 --> 52:02.258
Yeah, you will.
It's your night.

52:05.067 --> 52:06.689
Tommy. Tommy.

52:06.837 --> 52:08.326
Look what washed up
on the beach.

52:08.473 --> 52:10.194
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

52:10.342 --> 52:12.397
Just came by to wish you well.

52:12.545 --> 52:13.665
Looking forward
to working with you.

52:13.814 --> 52:15.068
Shouldn't you be dead to me?

52:15.215 --> 52:17.771
Sheee-it. I took it
easy on you, son.

52:17.918 --> 52:20.274
I coulda had you
for twice as much.

52:20.422 --> 52:22.413
You got off cheap.

52:24.461 --> 52:26.487
He's right.

52:55.570 --> 52:57.369
Butchie sent us.

53:06.618 --> 53:09.308
What you in for?

53:09.457 --> 53:12.324
I'm here on a 22-55.

53:14.062 --> 53:15.826
I talked back.

53:22.340 --> 53:25.129
- Moolie?
- Moolie.

53:25.277 --> 53:26.397
He said that
in front of you?

53:26.546 --> 53:28.367
He made a point of it, in fact.

53:28.515 --> 53:30.338
You're the one said
I oughta shore up my base.

53:30.486 --> 53:31.806
You didn't call him on it?

53:31.955 --> 53:33.641
The ironies of democracy.

53:33.790 --> 53:36.345
A vote's a vote.
And I never throw one back.

53:36.494 --> 53:38.314
Speaking of ballots,
did you vote for me, Norman?

53:38.462 --> 53:40.417
The sanctity
of the voting booth

53:40.564 --> 53:43.694
is a cornerstone
of American democracy.

53:46.407 --> 53:48.262
I gotta go.
You need a ride?

53:48.409 --> 53:51.399
- Yeah.
- Come here. You're the best.

53:51.547 --> 53:53.134
Thanks, Norman.

53:53.283 --> 53:56.306
- Yeah, take a break.
- You got it.

53:56.454 --> 53:57.908
One day.
Two days.

53:58.055 --> 53:59.342
Come here, you.

53:59.491 --> 54:01.445
- Be good.
- I'm gonna call you.

54:01.593 --> 54:03.027
I have
a feeling you might.

54:10.940 --> 54:12.602
Good night.

54:15.280 --> 54:18.770
Ooh, I should go, too.

54:18.919 --> 54:20.372
One for the road?

54:20.520 --> 54:24.144
Sure. Scotch okay?

54:24.292 --> 54:25.816
Sure.

54:31.569 --> 54:34.323
You know, I gotta admit,
it feels good.

54:34.471 --> 54:36.494
You deserve it.

54:36.642 --> 54:39.397
You worked hard.

54:39.546 --> 54:41.435
I did. I do.

54:41.582 --> 54:44.313
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

54:50.160 --> 54:55.120
You know, when I took this job,
you promised me a win bonus.

54:55.267 --> 54:57.361
Well, you earned it.

55:21.969 --> 55:24.327
I can't do this.
Not now.

55:24.475 --> 55:26.596
Oh, come on, Tommy.

55:26.745 --> 55:29.399
You haven't changed.

55:29.547 --> 55:30.935
Hell, from what
Norman tells me,

55:31.082 --> 55:33.571
you nearly fell off
the campaign trail for a blonde

55:33.719 --> 55:37.110
at the Stonewall dinner
two months ago.

55:37.257 --> 55:39.946
He had to drag you
out of the bar.

55:40.095 --> 55:42.651
It's not that
I don't want to--

55:42.800 --> 55:46.890
Oh, you're feeling
a bit mayoral. Right.

55:47.039 --> 55:50.094
You're onstage now.

55:50.243 --> 55:52.097
Well, Tommy...

55:52.245 --> 55:56.235
four years is a long time
for a fellow like you.

55:56.384 --> 55:59.684
This could be
your last chance for a while.

56:16.646 --> 56:18.546
You sure?

56:23.154 --> 56:25.555
Maybe you have
learned something.

56:37.540 --> 56:39.441
Write me a check.
