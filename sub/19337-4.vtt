03:19.266 --> 03:21.833
Rather than risk civil war

03:30.878 --> 03:32.611
I shouldn't have
to sway them.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.413
They're<i> Englishmen.</i>

03:34.415 --> 03:37.816
They are Catholics who claim
the Pope speaks the will of God!

03:37.818 --> 03:39.284
And he does not like you.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.886

the largest lands

09:28.936 --> 09:31.670
And will, no doubt, petition
the Vatican to remove

09:31.672 --> 09:35.840
not just you
but the entire Valois line.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.208
And few
would object.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.844
The Valois are not beloved.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.580
They say that
Francis was frail

09:41.582 --> 09:43.348
and you, the next
king, too young.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.585
And now there is talk
of your mental state.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.987
You barely eat.
You look like the living dead.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.856
You are silent to the
servants, to the nobles,

09:51.858 --> 09:53.658
to the privy council.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.859
You rarely leave your chambers.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.328
And when you do,
where do you go?

09:56.330 --> 09:57.963
You say that
you're out hunting.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.831
What kind of hunting
are you doing?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.933
When Bianca fled,
were you giving chase?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.203
Answer me!

10:05.205 --> 10:06.805
You do realize

10:06.807 --> 10:08.139
that this girl's story

10:08.141 --> 10:10.642
could rob us of all we possess.

10:11.745 --> 10:15.046
She's lucky to be alive.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.285
How is my brother?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.887
Not feeling up to being king
again today?

10:22.889 --> 10:24.723
Good day,
Your Majesty.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.691
Charles is fine.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.094
He's just taken
to his chambers for rest.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.295
A bear in hibernation
does not rest

10:30.297 --> 10:31.830
as much as my young brother.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.164
Perhaps a touch
from "St. Claude"

10:33.166 --> 10:34.299
can miraculously revive him.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.767
You know that your sister

10:35.769 --> 10:37.235
has put her "saintly" days
behind her.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.637
Clearly,

10:38.639 --> 10:39.738
as she has now
taken up the hobby

10:39.740 --> 10:41.172
of sleeping with married men.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.173
Married men?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.242
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.778
If I may, that does not
sound like Claude.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.780
She's free-spirited...
She is partaking in adultery.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.782
And the Church will
deal with it swiftly

10:50.784 --> 10:52.751
and harshly.
Stop playing the prude,

10:52.753 --> 10:53.918
Leeza.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.920
These laws are not enforced,
not really,

10:55.922 --> 10:57.722
or half the court
would be punished.

10:57.724 --> 10:58.757
In France.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.992
Let me speak to her.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.262
(whispering):
You're too late for that.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.872
I beg you, look at me.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.807
Why?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.942
Why must I look?

11:17.944 --> 11:20.845
Why must I kiss?
Why must I speak?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.947
You have a wife for such things.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.383
I-I'm sorry.
I only want to...

11:25.385 --> 11:27.352
Pleasure me?

11:27.354 --> 11:29.354
Then do as we agreed.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.756
Use your lips where I might
forget who you are

11:31.758 --> 11:33.825
and imagine you as I wish.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.093
Or better yet,

11:35.095 --> 11:37.295
make me stop thinking at all.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.365
(sighs)

11:43.770 --> 11:45.003
(gasps)

11:45.005 --> 11:47.005
Stop! Stop!

11:47.007 --> 11:48.373
What are you doing?!

11:48.375 --> 11:50.175
I command you, leave at once!
(grunting)

11:50.177 --> 11:51.976
Release me!
This is not what it appears!

11:55.115 --> 11:56.915
EMILY:
<i> I've given it thought, James.</i>

11:56.917 --> 11:58.983
You should not be here.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.052
Not in my home.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.021
But I am only here because
you invited me.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.289
And I only invited you because
you have been

12:04.291 --> 12:05.490
relentless in your pursuit.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.893
I needed to speak
to you freely,

12:08.895 --> 12:11.296
but now...

12:11.298 --> 12:14.365
I am truly sorry if my presence
causes you discomfort.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.468
Please,

12:16.470 --> 12:18.203
don't lie to me.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.971
Or to yourself.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.139
In my position,

12:21.141 --> 12:22.807
I am constantly surrounded
by those

12:22.809 --> 12:24.342
who would seek to deceive me.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.378
It would pain me to think
that you are no different.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.446
James,

12:28.448 --> 12:30.281
I would never deceive you,

12:30.283 --> 12:32.217
but I cannot.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.018
You invited me here

12:34.020 --> 12:35.854
because you think of me

12:35.856 --> 12:38.823
as often as I think of you.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.191
Sir, you are too bold.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.461
Because your husband
is safely away.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.230
And because,

12:45.232 --> 12:49.200
from the day we met,

12:49.202 --> 12:51.970
we've both burned for this.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.974
I will burn for this.

13:05.886 --> 13:06.918
God save my soul.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.853
I can't.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.159
(door closes)

13:24.104 --> 13:25.837
You humiliated me!
(scoffs)

13:25.839 --> 13:28.072
What happens within this room
is my business alone.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.074
Not yours, not the Church's,
not...

13:30.076 --> 13:31.810
Spare me your
humiliation.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.945
What about the shame you've
brought to this family?

13:33.947 --> 13:35.947
Not to mention this country
and to God himself?

13:35.949 --> 13:37.215
Enough!

13:37.217 --> 13:40.118
God himself has seen
much worse and survived.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.252
He will this, as well.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.588
Can't you see your sister
is grieving?

13:43.590 --> 13:44.823
She's trying to
push away the pain

13:44.825 --> 13:46.057
of Leith's death.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.826
Of course.

13:47.828 --> 13:48.960
Take her side.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.829
Rules don't apply
to Claude.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.363
They never have.
She does as she pleases,

13:52.365 --> 13:54.499
whereas I've always
been dutiful,

13:54.501 --> 13:56.234
marrying for
the good of France.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.836
Yes! And you're happy
with Philip!

13:57.838 --> 13:59.237
Why do you punish Mother,

13:59.239 --> 14:01.339
all of us, for something that
made your life better?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.341
Because my life used to be
so much worse

14:03.343 --> 14:04.542
when I lived here.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.411
Yours seems as if
it's been grand.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.913
So close to Mother,
always defends you.

14:08.915 --> 14:10.582
There is a price to pay...

14:10.584 --> 14:12.217
For being loved?

14:12.218 --> 14:13.851
For growing close
to one another?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.153
For the sins of the flesh.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.188
You are not my judge!

14:17.190 --> 14:19.324
No, but my church
and my God are.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.959
And they've already decided
on your punishment.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.393
No.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.630
You're being sent to a nunnery.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.898
You can't do that.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.634
Thanks to the laws of our faith

14:29.636 --> 14:31.102
and my friends
at the Vatican

14:31.104 --> 14:32.303
who enforce them,

14:32.305 --> 14:34.572
it's already been done.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.147
(birds chirping)

14:48.521 --> 14:50.555
Your form is very impressive.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.991
I'm glad you think so.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.592
I've been playing
since I was a child.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.927
Really?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.495
Hmm.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.030
Perhaps we'll take
our own children

14:59.032 --> 15:01.332
to the links at St. Andrews
one day.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.103
We just met an hour ago
and already we have children?

15:05.105 --> 15:07.105
Well, the sooner
we have a child,

15:07.107 --> 15:08.673
the sooner our line is ensured.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.308
Ah. Politics?

15:10.310 --> 15:12.443
And just when I was
beginning to enjoy myself.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.179
You may have intruded
on my holiday, Lord Darnley,

15:15.181 --> 15:18.349
but I will not let you
spoil it with business.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.054
Although
I am curious.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.455
Have you already
named our children?

15:24.457 --> 15:26.190
Or did you leave
at least that part for me?

15:26.192 --> 15:28.259
(chuckling)

15:28.261 --> 15:30.428
Well, I hope one of them
will be called James.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.564
After our father.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.066
You must be
Lord Darnley.
Indeed.

15:35.068 --> 15:38.436
I'm going to hazard a guess
that you are James?

15:38.438 --> 15:41.506
Lord Moray, my brother
and most trusted adviser.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.409
And it is as your adviser
that I am here.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.210
I have news that
cannot wait.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.679
For the queen.

15:49.015 --> 15:50.949
Please excuse us, Lord Darnley.

15:52.352 --> 15:56.220
I've learned that John Knox
is speaking this very day

15:56.222 --> 15:57.622
at a farm outside Perthshire.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.958
He intends to turn Catholics
against you.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.360
What import could a place
like that have for Knox?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.395
They are hosting
a harvest festival.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.230
People travel for miles
to attend.

16:06.232 --> 16:10.401
His hope is that they will take
his poisoned seeds of discontent

16:10.403 --> 16:12.437
and scatter them as they return
to their homes.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.106
Why would loyal Catholics listen
to anything Knox has to say?

16:15.108 --> 16:16.641
Their crops have failed.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.276
The people have
little to eat.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.444
He's going to portray you

16:19.446 --> 16:21.512
as a distant
and uncaring queen.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.648
You could only know this if...

16:23.650 --> 16:25.249
I was in Knox's study.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.385
I read his personal notes.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.586
You have entered
the enemy's camp.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.654
Well done.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.122
And now I must
do the same.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.024
We will go to Perthshire.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.325
And where Knox
has sown hatred,

16:34.327 --> 16:36.060
we will scatter
seeds of hope.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.129
And if the people are hostile?

16:38.131 --> 16:39.464
I will give them a reason
not to be.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.432
And I will take
Darnley with me.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.568
Give him a chance to make a good
impression on the people,

16:43.570 --> 16:45.403
as he has with me.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.208
I was there

16:50.210 --> 16:52.176
when His Majesty
faced the boar,

16:52.178 --> 16:54.145
armed with only a spear.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.446
(scoffs)

16:55.448 --> 16:58.549
But King Henry VIII
was no ordinary man.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.619
My father was
a giant among men.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.221
"The Hunting King,"

17:03.223 --> 17:05.723
we called him.
How I miss the days

17:05.725 --> 17:09.193
when men were men
and kings were kings.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.162
Fortunately, we are
blessed with a queen

17:11.164 --> 17:13.464
who stands strong in defense
of her kingdom.

17:13.466 --> 17:16.801
And blessed to have nobles
such as yourself, Lord Maxford,

17:16.803 --> 17:18.669
setting such
a wonderful example:

17:18.671 --> 17:21.606
a Catholic lord treating fairly
the Protestant farmers

17:21.608 --> 17:22.740
who till his land.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.709
You are a living symbol

17:24.711 --> 17:27.178
of the unified England
I wish to preserve.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.813
I'm a businessman.

17:28.815 --> 17:32.417
Matters of faith should never
interfere with one's accounts.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.385
Or... alliances.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.154
Well, if only others
shared your view.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.756
I wish to work with
enlightened men such as yourself

17:38.758 --> 17:40.525
to bridge that chasm...
The real threat

17:40.527 --> 17:43.828
to England does not come
from petty squabbles

17:43.830 --> 17:46.397
over prayer books
or even Scotland.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.166
Our greatest threat
is from overseas.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.200
You're a reasonable man.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.535
You know of what I speak.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.503
You mean Spain.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.589
Spain is building a vast fleet

17:54.590 --> 17:56.674
that will one day bring
an invading army to our shores.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.743
And our navy is
too weak to stop them.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.311
England once
ruled the seas.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.080
But alas,
(sighs)

18:02.082 --> 18:04.816
there are no men left with
King Henry's vision. Hmm.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.086
ELIZABETH:
<i> That pompous prig.</i>

18:08.088 --> 18:09.187
He couldn't-- no, he<i> wouldn't</i>

18:09.189 --> 18:10.521
even look at me.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.623
It is though my sex
rendered me invisible.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.258
Maxford is a blowhard.
(exhales)

18:14.260 --> 18:15.793
But his support will
protect your throne.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.762
(chuckles)
He will never
protect my throne

18:17.764 --> 18:19.330
as long as a woman
sits on it.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.498
You're not just any woman.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.766
You are the daughter
of Henry VIII,

18:21.768 --> 18:22.867
a king he reveres.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.369
You're right.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.371
If I am to win his favor,

18:27.373 --> 18:29.674
the best way is to show him
who I really am.

18:29.676 --> 18:30.875
Gideon,

18:30.877 --> 18:33.144
tell Lord Maxford
I'm inviting him

18:33.146 --> 18:35.246
and the other Catholic nobles
on a royal hunt.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.648
I can't guarantee
he'll accept.
He will...

18:37.650 --> 18:40.218
if you, a reasonable man,
joins us.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.886
Once we're
on the hunting ground,

18:41.888 --> 18:43.354
he'll learn--

18:43.356 --> 18:46.524
I am nothing less than
a Tudor queen.

18:46.526 --> 18:49.427
NARCISSE: I must admit,
since first hearing of it,

18:49.429 --> 18:52.897
I have given a great deal of
thought to Claude in a nunnery.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.132
Why is that?

18:54.134 --> 18:55.766
Because it arouses me.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.703
Oh...
A common enough fetish,
I'm told.

18:58.705 --> 19:02.640
Have you convinced Leeza
to spare her yet?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.142
If you haven't noticed,

19:04.144 --> 19:07.512
the Spanish crown she wears
has made her deaf

19:07.514 --> 19:09.280
where I'm concerned.

19:09.282 --> 19:12.850
If Leeza can push out Claude,
who's next? Charles?

19:12.852 --> 19:14.552
I think we are yet
a distance from that.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.187
Well, you better hope so.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.589
Without a Valois
on the throne,

19:18.591 --> 19:20.658
there's no saying who
the next king will choose

19:20.660 --> 19:22.393
as lord chancellor.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.763
Leeza's already tried
to replace you once.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.699
Well, perhaps I should
talk to her.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.268
On Claude's behalf.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.303
What are you up to?
I desire only to help.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.405
And because I am
not her mother,

19:34.407 --> 19:36.874
I believe her hearing might
greatly improve when I speak.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.477
Very well.
Speak with her.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.215
(goat bleating)

19:46.352 --> 19:48.619
KNOX: Today,
we celebrate the harvest.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.821
And yet...

19:50.823 --> 19:52.190
many go hungry.

19:52.192 --> 19:55.760
I have cried out,
"Why, God?

19:55.762 --> 19:57.328
"Why must the people who
work the hardest

19:57.330 --> 19:58.496
suffer the most?"

19:58.498 --> 20:00.831
It is because Queen Mary

20:00.833 --> 20:03.534
is a spoiled French girl
who does not care.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.969
She and her church

20:04.971 --> 20:08.206
take your tithes
and spend it on clothes

20:08.208 --> 20:11.209
and outlandish luxuries.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.377
While she gets fatter,
you starve.

20:13.379 --> 20:18.216
To her, you are less than chaff
blowing in the wind.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.617
That is a lie!

20:19.619 --> 20:22.486
(crowd murmuring)
MAN:
It's the queen.

20:22.488 --> 20:25.256
Reverend Knox is good
with words.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.258
But what good are words
when you are hungry?

20:27.260 --> 20:28.693
You cannot eat them.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.662
You cannot fill your children's
bellies with them.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.282
Lord Darnley,

20:34.283 --> 20:35.833
show these people that
their queen has brought them

20:35.835 --> 20:37.969
more than words.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.437
(crowd exclaiming)

20:39.439 --> 20:41.505
I bring you food
for your families.

20:41.507 --> 20:42.540
(applause, cheering)

20:42.542 --> 20:45.243
MAN: Thank you,
Your Majesty.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.379
God save
Your Majesty.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.619
(laughter, whistling)

20:54.621 --> 20:57.788
(joyful music plays)

20:57.790 --> 21:00.024
(whooping)

21:01.761 --> 21:03.527
God bless you.

21:03.529 --> 21:06.464
Can't deny they
are well suited,

21:06.466 --> 21:08.633
and Mary could do much worse.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.701
Perhaps.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.272
KNOX:
Look at her.

21:14.274 --> 21:16.040
She's got the ignorant
fools eating

21:16.042 --> 21:18.009
quite literally from her hand.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.610
Bless you.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.614
KNOX:
We must end this gathering.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.617
Now.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.303
Bless you.

21:29.304 --> 21:30.687
It was Christ himself
who instructed all of us

21:30.690 --> 21:31.789
to pray for our daily bread.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.824
MARY:
And it is God who answers.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.559
We are merely his servants.

21:40.566 --> 21:41.832
(horse neighs)

21:41.834 --> 21:43.701
Knox is leaving.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.770
I think you've won.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.710
(indistinct chatter)

21:52.712 --> 21:54.912
BOY:
Fire!

21:54.914 --> 21:56.414
(people screaming)

21:56.416 --> 21:58.316
WOMAN: Fire!

21:58.318 --> 22:01.052
(screams and shouts)

22:01.054 --> 22:02.920
CROWD:
Fire!

22:08.461 --> 22:09.660
(mass screaming and panic)

22:09.662 --> 22:11.462
We need to get you
out of here!

22:11.464 --> 22:13.464
No, the fire could spread
to the crops! We must help!

22:13.466 --> 22:14.465
Mary!

22:14.467 --> 22:16.867
(horses neighing)

22:16.869 --> 22:19.337
(crowd shouting)

22:51.104 --> 22:52.903
(shouting stops,
quiet coughs)

22:52.905 --> 22:54.505
MAN:
Are the girls all right?

22:54.507 --> 22:57.408
(overlapping chatter)

22:57.410 --> 22:58.776
GREER:
Is everyone all right?

22:58.778 --> 23:00.778
I feel as though my arms
are going to drop off,

23:00.780 --> 23:01.779
but the fire is out.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.514
That's all that...

23:03.516 --> 23:05.116
James, you're burned!

23:05.118 --> 23:06.984
It's nothing.
I'm fine.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.520
WOMAN: Three cheers
for Mary, Queen of Scots!

23:09.522 --> 23:13.924
CROWD:
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

23:17.830 --> 23:19.697
MAN: Your gracious Majesty,
thank you!

23:20.867 --> 23:24.502
You'll be as good
as new in no time.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.070
Has either of you seen
Lord Darnley?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.471
I can't seem to find him.

23:27.473 --> 23:29.673
I saw him with the
horses during the fire,

23:29.675 --> 23:30.608
but since then...

23:30.610 --> 23:32.109
MAN:
Fire!

23:32.111 --> 23:33.644
(screams and panic)

23:33.646 --> 23:34.745
Oh, not again.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.614
WOMAN:
Help! My boy's in there!

23:36.616 --> 23:37.715
Help!

23:39.652 --> 23:40.651
(whimper)

23:40.653 --> 23:41.652
(boy crying)

23:41.654 --> 23:42.853
MARY: It's Darnley!

23:45.658 --> 23:46.857
(boy sobs)

23:46.859 --> 23:48.793
(Darnley coughs)

24:00.473 --> 24:03.007
MAXFORD:
The farmer says,
"I think my wife's dead.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.976
The sex is about the same,
but the dishes are piling up."

24:05.978 --> 24:07.144
(men laugh)

24:07.146 --> 24:08.712
(forced laughter)

24:08.714 --> 24:10.448
It's unfortunate Gideon
couldn't be here.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.583
I hope he's not out
courting some other queen.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.685
I'm thankful you were
gracious enough

24:14.687 --> 24:16.086
to continue the hunt
without him.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.823
You seem surprised
yourself he didn't show.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.544
(loud snap)

24:43.015 --> 24:44.215
(arrow connects,
animal falls)
Ha!

25:00.733 --> 25:02.166
Your Majesty,

25:02.168 --> 25:05.636
the skill you showed
on the hunting grounds today

25:05.638 --> 25:07.872
reveals a warrior's instinct.

25:07.874 --> 25:11.141
A trait you no doubt inherited
from your father.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.277
I'm not sure I would have
bagged such a prize stag

25:13.279 --> 25:15.546
had you not flushed him out
for me.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.117
Being in your woods today
reminded me

25:20.119 --> 25:22.069
of something you said.

25:22.070 --> 25:24.020
Your concern of a possible
Spanish invasion,

25:24.023 --> 25:25.222
and you're right.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.158
Our Royal Navy needs
a much larger fleet,

25:28.160 --> 25:31.562
but such a fleet would require
a vast amount of lumber.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.931
Lumber you have in abundance
in your own backyard.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.100
I wonder, would you
consider selling

25:36.102 --> 25:37.234
that lumber to the Crown?

25:37.236 --> 25:40.571
At a very fair price, of course.

25:40.573 --> 25:44.008
Such patriotism deserves
to be richly rewarded.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.310
That is a brilliant idea.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.879
In exchange for such
an arrangement,

25:48.881 --> 25:52.550
I would need to know
I had your full support

25:52.552 --> 25:54.985
and the support
of your Catholic friends.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.154
That would include not meeting

25:57.156 --> 25:59.240
with representatives
of the Vatican,

25:59.241 --> 26:01.325
should they choose to turn their
attention your way.

26:03.629 --> 26:08.766
I hereby pledge my undying
loyalty to the Crown.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.068
And if the Vatican were to call,

26:11.070 --> 26:14.305
they would find us
otherwise occupied.

26:14.307 --> 26:16.674
To the hunting queen!

26:16.676 --> 26:18.909
Queen!
Queen!
To the queen!

26:21.314 --> 26:23.681
Please tell me you've
succeeded in curbing my

26:23.683 --> 26:26.050
Spanish mule of a daughter's
flight of jealousy.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.986
Leeza will no longer require
Claude to join a convent.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.121
Well, surely not out
of the goodness of her heart.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.324
There was only one way
that she would agree

26:33.326 --> 26:35.726
to allow her sister
to lead a non-celibate life.

26:35.728 --> 26:39.830
Leeza wants Claude wed.
To a Catholic noble

26:39.832 --> 26:42.366
of respectable rank and title.
Claude has

26:42.368 --> 26:44.868
earned the right
to choose her own husband.

26:44.870 --> 26:46.236
Yes, well...

26:46.238 --> 26:48.872
her husband has
already been chosen.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.142
Terms of the deal.
CLAUDE:
<i> I've never even</i>

26:52.144 --> 26:54.278
heard of this
Luc Narcisse.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.747
I have a handful
of adult children.

26:56.749 --> 27:00.284
Oh, if it puts your mind
at ease, this particular apple

27:00.286 --> 27:02.853
fell some distance
from the tree.
That's hard

27:02.855 --> 27:06.023
to believe when he carries
your name. This is your fault!

27:06.025 --> 27:08.025
Your fault you weren't
a better mother to Leeza.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.094
Your fault she's turning years
of resentment against me...

27:10.096 --> 27:11.929
I know, Claude. I'm sorry.

27:11.931 --> 27:14.665
She has the laws
of our faith on her side.

27:14.667 --> 27:17.935
You need to make a decision:
marriage or the nunnery.

27:17.937 --> 27:22.906
Do I at least get to meet my
future husband before I choose?

27:24.043 --> 27:26.176
(horse neighing)

27:28.080 --> 27:30.848
(sighs)

27:33.653 --> 27:35.185
Father.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.720
Queen Mother.

27:38.090 --> 27:41.291
And you must be Princess Claude.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.801
I have a confession to make.
I'm not a virgin, either.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.337
I'm glad you're
enjoying this situation.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.340
And I don't mean to make light
of the circumstances.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.108
Believe me, this is
all happening

27:58.110 --> 28:00.678
just as quickly for me.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.813
But I want to make this work.

28:02.815 --> 28:05.182
Plenty of arranged marriages do.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.917
And plenty don't.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.719
Two random people forced

28:08.721 --> 28:10.120
to spend the rest of
their lives together?

28:10.122 --> 28:12.022
You don't even know who I am,

28:12.024 --> 28:14.358
what I like...

28:14.360 --> 28:16.326
who I love.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.796
No, but I have
heard about you.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.431
Enough to know
that I would not seek

28:20.433 --> 28:24.401
to change your spirit,
but to embrace it.

28:26.338 --> 28:30.407
I will prove myself
to be a loyal husband,

28:30.409 --> 28:32.710
one who can
protect you.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.945
I know who you are.

28:34.947 --> 28:38.082
You're the son of the most
ruthless man at French court.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.417
Well, I was never
his favorite son,

28:40.419 --> 28:41.919
because I was
never like him.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.721
Certainly, my father
has his reasons

28:43.723 --> 28:47.124
for suggesting this marriage,
as I do for accepting,

28:47.126 --> 28:49.259
but they're not
the same reasons.

28:49.261 --> 28:52.296
My relationship with
my father has had many...

28:52.298 --> 28:55.132
challenges.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.067
That's not the life I
wish for my children.

28:58.204 --> 29:01.205
Yes, I do expect
to have heirs.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.040
You are a princess, after all.

29:03.042 --> 29:06.143
They would get a good life.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.345
Not to mention...

29:11.417 --> 29:15.953
...I would be marrying
a most stunning woman.

29:19.158 --> 29:21.291
Luc, may I have

29:21.293 --> 29:24.027
a moment to speak
with my daughter in private?

29:24.029 --> 29:25.829
Of course.

29:27.933 --> 29:31.034
Things are going well,
I take it?

29:31.036 --> 29:35.339
It's not... awful.

29:35.341 --> 29:36.440
Mother,

29:36.442 --> 29:38.809
Leith.
Is gone.

29:38.811 --> 29:43.013
And Luc may<i> appear </i>
to be a decent man,

29:43.015 --> 29:46.083
but I've learned to never trust
the beginning of a book.

29:46.085 --> 29:49.353
He is a Narcisse, after all.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.421
I know this isn't
what you wanted,

29:51.423 --> 29:54.024
but for now,
this marriage will protect you.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.959
And because I am
partially to blame

29:55.961 --> 29:59.062
for your situation,
here is my promise to you.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.799
Once we rid this court of Leeza,

30:01.801 --> 30:04.334
I will help you deal
with the consequences of

30:04.336 --> 30:07.204
your union to Luc,
should there be any.

30:07.206 --> 30:11.475
If he ever lays a hand on you,

30:11.477 --> 30:14.478
I will get you out
of this marriage.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.213
Do you mean that?
I may not

30:16.215 --> 30:18.348
be able to get you back
from a nunnery,

30:18.350 --> 30:22.119
but when the time is right,
I<i> can</i> make you a widow.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.322
All right.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.224
I'll do it.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.027
I'll... marry Luc.

30:33.365 --> 30:36.967
You showed great courage
when you saved that child.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.970
It has convinced many,
who will persuade many more,

30:39.972 --> 30:41.839
that you would be a worthy king.

30:41.841 --> 30:44.007
The courage I showed was no more
than your own.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.976
And the only person I wish

30:45.978 --> 30:47.978
to persuade
of my worth sits before me.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.848
I'll be honest, Lord Darnley.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.851
I did not expect to like you...
but I do.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.519
If you find the terms

30:55.521 --> 30:59.089
that I have laid out
for our marriage acceptable,

30:59.091 --> 31:01.892
our union will
serve Scotland well.

31:01.894 --> 31:05.028
But I find myself wondering

31:05.030 --> 31:07.865
if this is something
that you would...

31:07.867 --> 31:09.399
Am I...?

31:11.904 --> 31:14.104
Am I what you expected?

31:16.175 --> 31:18.342
You are more so.

31:18.344 --> 31:21.011
I only wish that your regard
for me could be as generous.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.614
Why do you say it is not?

31:23.616 --> 31:25.249
Because of what you withhold.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.518
The Crown Matrimonial.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.488
Oh, how romantic.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.290
Your thoughts are already
of your life without me

31:33.292 --> 31:34.625
after I am dead.

31:34.627 --> 31:37.027
Not at all.
I'm thinking<i> of</i> you.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.428
Of carrying on
<i> your</i> legacy.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.298
Mary, people die
all the time.

31:41.300 --> 31:44.001
Women more so
of illness, childbirth...

31:44.003 --> 31:45.302
Assassination?

31:45.304 --> 31:48.438
I would protect you with my life

31:48.440 --> 31:50.574
against all things

31:50.576 --> 31:52.342
if I could.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.610
Would you?

31:53.612 --> 31:56.013
A wife you
barely know?

31:56.015 --> 31:58.048
Your logic is new.

31:58.050 --> 32:01.218
But I've had this request
made of me by another.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.020
And he plotted
to have me killed.

32:03.022 --> 32:05.589
I am generous but
only to a point.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.991
In the matter of the Crown
Matrimonial, I will not yield.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.696
I hadn't realized
your painful history

32:12.698 --> 32:14.264
with regard to this.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.270
All right.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.571
I accept your terms.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.674
Well, you don't seem
happy about it.

32:23.676 --> 32:27.611
I am an ambitious man.

32:27.613 --> 32:31.148
And if this is my one chance
at king, I will take it.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.150
And if I am king for only
as long as you live,

32:33.152 --> 32:35.485
then I say long live the queen.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.091
That's it, then.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.592
We will be wed.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.095
For Scotland.

canceled the hunt

My daughter's condition

37:41.460 --> 37:43.360
The doctors don't
know what to do.

They have told me

Without Agatha, I am lost.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.901
I'm so sorry.

I didn't know.

Yet<i> I</i> should have.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.044
I was so busy keeping

38:01.046 --> 38:03.847
your house in order
that I let my own crumble.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.782
Don't lose hope, Gideon.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.917
I promise you

I will do everything

38:14.426 --> 38:16.826
You have no power over this.

None at all.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.973

38:29.975 --> 38:32.309

I think it is.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.662
Look at me.

38:56.968 --> 38:59.703
Would you mind
if I kissed you now?

39:02.474 --> 39:06.042
I have not kissed
a man since Leith.

39:13.885 --> 39:17.053
When I heard it,
I didn't believe it.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.025
We thought you were dead.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.094
There were days I wished I was.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.364
But I knew Claude was waiting.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.032
You shouldn't have come back.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.601
Then it's true.

39:31.603 --> 39:35.438
What I've just been told.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.640
Claude has wed.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.513
This very night.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.715
Then there's still a chance.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.851
If she hasn't
consummated the marriage,

39:47.853 --> 39:49.052
it can still be annulled.
I have to find her.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.153
Let her know that I'm alive.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.421
That I'm back.

39:51.423 --> 39:52.689
I'm sorry, Leith.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.057
But I cannot allow that
to happen.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.892
Why are you doing this?

39:55.894 --> 39:57.093
Claude has married my son.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.561
No. No!

39:58.563 --> 39:59.629
And it's my duty
to ensure they have

39:59.631 --> 40:01.965
a long and happy marriage.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.633
Take him away.

40:03.635 --> 40:04.701
No!

40:04.703 --> 40:05.802
Claude!

40:05.804 --> 40:07.771
I am an officer
of the kingsguard!

40:07.773 --> 40:08.772
Let me go!

40:08.774 --> 40:10.807
Claude!
Claude!

40:10.809 --> 40:12.542
You're getting married.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.477
I do wish you were
happier about this.

40:14.479 --> 40:17.781
It's the decision I made
when I sent Gideon away.

40:17.783 --> 40:20.083
(sighs)
But still,

40:20.085 --> 40:21.918
for a moment there
I allowed myself

40:21.920 --> 40:24.487
to think it could be more.

40:24.489 --> 40:26.589
When we were
handing out bread,

40:26.591 --> 40:28.792
fighting the fire together,

40:28.794 --> 40:31.494
not as king and queen,
but as

40:31.496 --> 40:33.997
two people
of like mind and spirit.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.466
Like you and Francis.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.802
Darnley has shown
his true ambition.

40:38.804 --> 40:41.571
Can you blame anyone
for wanting to be king?

40:43.775 --> 40:45.675
No, I suppose not.

40:45.677 --> 40:47.043
You don't have to marry him.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.978
If I want to challenge
Elizabeth and survive,

40:48.980 --> 40:50.480
I do.
But what is survival

40:50.482 --> 40:51.614
without even the hope of love?

40:51.616 --> 40:53.550
My people...

40:53.552 --> 40:54.851
I'm not talking
about your subjects.

40:54.853 --> 40:55.985
I'm talking
about you.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.120
I know you, Mary.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.555
It won't be enough.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.924
It will have to be enough.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.696
What's this wood?

41:06.698 --> 41:08.097
I don't know.

41:08.099 --> 41:09.599
Is that wood burnt?

41:14.206 --> 41:16.940
It says, "Be careful.

his own fire

41:22.647 --> 41:24.948
"Loyal Watchman"?

41:24.950 --> 41:26.549
Who is that?

41:26.551 --> 41:28.585
I have no idea.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.821
Do you think
it's true?

41:31.823 --> 41:33.756
Could Darnley have done
such a thing?
