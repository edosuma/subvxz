00:06.423 --> 00:09.343
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:09.718 --> 00:11.929
I am Tanith.

00:12.012 --> 00:16.642
It is my honour to pledge
my allegiance to the Tok'ra.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.728
If we allow Tanith
to believe he has deceived us,...

00:19.853 --> 00:22.731
..we will be able to use that
against the Goa'uld.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.858
- Disinformation.
- Yes.

00:25.317 --> 00:29.613
I hope one day we will meet again, Teal'c.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.616
You have my promise.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.743
Argh!

00:35.244 --> 00:39.289
- (woman) What did it show?
- The murder of my father.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.749
So what now?

00:40.874 --> 00:45.337
Apophis will easily absorb
Heru-ur's forces into his own.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.799
He is now a bigger
threat than ever before.

00:52.594 --> 00:56.598
Cronus came in his ship and said that
our planet now fell under his domain.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.475
He commanded we worship him.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.104
What do we do with the other Jaffa
once we've dealt with Cronus?

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.585 --> 01:26.712
Go tell your people Cronus is dead.

01:53.864 --> 01:57.701
- What is happening?
- There's a mother ship entering orbit.

02:06.168 --> 02:10.005
- We must evacuate immediately.
- We have been expecting it.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.807
Hey, kids.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.186
We're not parked in a red zone, are we?

03:34.381 --> 03:38.677
- Tanith was surprised to see us.
- We didn't want to give him any warning.

03:38.802 --> 03:43.015
- He doesn't suspect you're on to him?
- We'll see soon enough.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.434
Of what do you speak?

03:45.559 --> 03:48.896
Thanks to the mother ship
you're so graciously lending us...

03:48.979 --> 03:51.815
Not me. Hammond.
It was an order, remember?

03:51.899 --> 03:56.695
Anyway, we can move the Stargate to
a planet not currently on the Goa'uld map.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.532
We can finally ensure the security
of a more permanent Tok'ra base.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.578
As useful as Tanith has been in
relaying false information to Apophis,...

04:04.703 --> 04:08.373
- ..we can't afford to take him with us.
- What will become of him?

04:08.499 --> 04:10.626
We have a little surprise planned.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.753
Shall we?

04:17.925 --> 04:22.304
Colonel O'Neill, Teal'c, allow me
to welcome you back to Vorash.

04:22.804 --> 04:27.059
- High Council Per'sus sends greetings.
- Always a pleasure.

04:27.851 --> 04:32.231
I must say, Colonel, I was most
intrigued by your means of arrival.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.275
Yeah, it's a sweet ride.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.403
A little rusty, but it's still got zip.

04:39.238 --> 04:42.908
How exactly did a Goa'uld
mother ship come into your possession?

04:44.493 --> 04:48.163
Well, it was kind of a... trade deal.

04:49.331 --> 04:53.085
- How so?
- Cronus gave us his ship,...

04:53.210 --> 04:55.838
..and he got what was comin' to him.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.384
Really? Cronus is dead?

05:04.513 --> 05:09.476
Now we have access to a mother ship we
can move our people and our Stargate,...

05:09.601 --> 05:13.522
..and thereby establish
a completely new and secure base.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.942
I don't understand.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.737
Why have I been excluded
from such important information?

05:21.280 --> 05:24.241
The Tok'ra did not wish
Apophis to be informed.

05:27.578 --> 05:30.664
We've been aware of your
duplicity from the beginning.

05:30.789 --> 05:34.626
You deceived and then murdered
the Jaffa Shan'auc.

05:34.751 --> 05:40.174
You took the host Hebron, and have been
acting as a spy amongst us ever since.

05:41.717 --> 05:45.220
You have been used
to channel misinformation to Apophis.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.849
He will be most displeased
when he learns the truth.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.813
This is absurd.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.614
You will never escape.

06:05.282 --> 06:10.621
The System Lords will hunt
you down to the ends of the galaxy.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.635
That guy is a living clichÃ©.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.896
I wish to speak to the prisoner.

06:46.198 --> 06:50.577
I wasn't aware I was allowed guests.
How kind of you to visit me, Teal'c.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.081
My presence here is
not motivated by kindness.

06:54.164 --> 06:58.418
I am here to deliver your sentence
as decreed by the Tok'ra High Council.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.796
Death, I suppose.

07:00.921 --> 07:05.300
You are to be extracted from the host
Hebron, and left behind here on Vorash.

07:05.384 --> 07:11.306
If fortunate, you will die before Apophis
discovers you were used by the Tok'ra.

07:11.390 --> 07:16.019
I am sure that you would like
to kill me with your bare hands,...

07:16.144 --> 07:19.022
..as I did your beloved Shan'auc.

07:20.524 --> 07:23.861
You, of all, would appreciate
how much more satisfying it is...

07:23.944 --> 07:28.657
..to see the fear and pain
in the eyes of your victim as they die.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.620
You took great pleasure
in the murder of Shan'auc,...

07:33.704 --> 07:36.957
..but you must understand
the price you paid.

07:38.041 --> 07:42.588
While Apophis was being diverted
by your unwitting deception,...

07:42.713 --> 07:47.843
..the Tok'ra were able to move freely
through Goa'uld territory untouched,...

07:47.926 --> 07:51.847
..rescuing stranded agents,
freeing captured allies.

07:51.972 --> 07:56.268
Hundreds of lives were saved
by the false information you spread.

07:57.436 --> 08:00.606
The Tok'ra owe you
a debt of gratitude, Tanith.

08:00.689 --> 08:04.359
Were it not for the ease with which
you let yourself be manipulated,...

08:04.443 --> 08:06.987
..Apophis may have eliminated the Tok'ra.

08:07.070 --> 08:10.032
All they have done is win a respite.

08:10.115 --> 08:15.329
Inevitably, the Tok'ra-Tauri alliance
will fall, like so many others.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.706
Not by any action of yours.

08:17.831 --> 08:23.045
I will watch you die like all the other false
gods whose demise I have witnessed.

08:24.630 --> 08:27.090
Sokar, Seth,...

08:27.799 --> 08:29.259
..Hathor,...

08:29.343 --> 08:31.887
..Heru-ur, Cronus.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.515
I am sure they died with
more honour than Shan'auc.

08:35.640 --> 08:40.437
She cried out for you
like a baby weeps for its mother,...

08:40.562 --> 08:43.732
..as I slowly extinguished her life.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.612
You are attempting
to goad me into killing you,...

08:48.695 --> 08:51.782
..thereby avoiding the extraction process.

08:54.451 --> 08:58.997
I understand it to be
excruciatingly painful for the symbiote.

09:04.378 --> 09:07.881
I am far more valuable
to you alive than dead.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.970
The Tok'ra do not believe so.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.016
And I am inclined to agree.

09:35.284 --> 09:40.247
Take that to the secondary cargo hold.
We need to make room for the Stargate.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.374
Hey!

09:42.499 --> 09:44.543
Don't scuff the walls.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.298
- I want the ship back the way we found it.
- We know, Jack.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.217
I still don't think it's necessary
for you to be here.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.678
Sorry. Not lettin' her out of my sight.

09:54.761 --> 09:59.224
My mission is to oversee the relocation
of the Tok'ra base. What's yours again?

09:59.349 --> 10:02.436
Protect Earth's big, fat asset.

10:02.561 --> 10:07.107
We've got 1 ,000 engineers and scientists
just droolin' to go through this thing.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.903
- You really think that's wise?
- Don't start with me, Jake.

10:11.028 --> 10:14.781
Remember when you tried
to retrofit a death glider?

10:14.865 --> 10:19.661
- Yes, I have that memory.
- This is vastly more complicated.

10:20.495 --> 10:24.666
Which is exactly why we're "Ioaning" it
to you in exchange for flying lessons.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.544
You know what I mean.
Leave the ship with us.

10:27.628 --> 10:31.048
- Not a chance.
- This is me talking. Jacob, not Selmak.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.592
You have no idea
how dangerous this thing is.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.637
Hey! We were smart enough
to steal it in the first place,...

10:36.720 --> 10:40.933
- ..which is more than the Tok'ra could do.
- We don't operate that way.

10:41.016 --> 10:44.269
Well, maybe it's time
you took a more direct approach.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.563
The Tok'ra have been around 2,000 years.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.775
In all that time, how many
System Lords have you taken down?

10:49.900 --> 10:55.113
Yeah, things have gotten better since you
started killing Goa'ulds off one by one(!)

10:55.239 --> 10:59.868
In each case, more warlike Goa'ulds
have stepped in to fill their place.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.037
There's more chaos than ever before.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.206
With the power Apophis now has...

11:04.331 --> 11:08.961
..we are on the brink of losing
any chance of ever defeating the Goa'uld.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.340
- At least we're doin' something.
- We are, too.

11:13.423 --> 11:18.053
Maybe our plan is a little more
long-term, but at least we have one.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.138
What plan?

11:20.556 --> 11:24.476
Undermine the Goa'ulds' power,
keep them fighting among themselves...

11:24.560 --> 11:28.647
..until we have a way of
eliminating them once and for all.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.774
Go on.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.443
We're working on it, Jack.

11:58.093 --> 12:02.389
You think you can save my host Hebron
by separating him from me?

12:02.472 --> 12:05.267
I will not allow you to kill me.

12:06.101 --> 12:11.148
Hebron's life is in my hands.
If I am to die, he will die with me.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.450
(thud)

12:23.744 --> 12:26.121
The prisoner just collapsed.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.629
Lower the shield.

12:33.712 --> 12:38.258
Lower the shield! We cannot just
stand by and allow him to kill the host.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.355
He's already dead.

12:54.149 --> 12:58.779
We've finished loading the ship. It's time
to start transporting your people up.

12:58.904 --> 13:01.823
- We'll begin immediately.
- (alarm)

13:09.414 --> 13:12.167
It's Tanith. He's escaped.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.333
Tanith could not have
escaped through the Stargate.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.878
It has been heavily
guarded the entire time.

13:56.003 --> 14:00.132
Yeah, what, by the same guys who
were guarding him in the first place?

14:00.215 --> 14:02.092
No offence.

14:02.176 --> 14:04.469
He is out here somewhere.

14:04.595 --> 14:07.139
Ah, well, he's boned without water.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.893
His symbiote will sustain him
for a considerable time.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.103
Big desert.

14:13.187 --> 14:15.230
I will continue looking.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.275
Keep in touch.

14:31.997 --> 14:35.167
So how do you guys
know where to stand anyway?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.254
(screeching, mechanical humming)

14:46.512 --> 14:50.766
- Any sign of him?
- Nope. He's still lookin'.

14:51.099 --> 14:54.353
You guys have been
out there for hours already.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.897
Yeah, it's a Jaffa revenge thing.

15:09.243 --> 15:12.996
Tanith's been busy. We've received
word from one of our operatives...

15:13.121 --> 15:16.375
..that Apophis has
been given our location.

15:16.458 --> 15:20.504
- He's making up for the last few months.
- An attack fleet is being assembled.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.841
- How long will it take 'em to get here?
- Less than a day.

15:23.924 --> 15:27.594
- We have to speed up the evacuation.
- We'll send them through the gate.

15:27.845 --> 15:30.514
I thought we were gonna
take 'em on the ship.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.308
Sam and I have come up with a new plan.

15:33.392 --> 15:37.688
If it works, we could wipe out a significant
part of Apophis's fleet in one shot.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.653
This is the sun that Vorash is orbiting.

15:44.778 --> 15:48.699
It's a main-sequence star with a
core temperature of 15 million degrees...

15:48.824 --> 15:52.578
..and enough hydrogen
to burn for another five billion years.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.790
Yeah?

15:56.999 --> 15:59.626
We wanna blow it up.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.753
- Wow.
- That's, uh...

16:02.921 --> 16:04.548
(both) Ambitious.

16:06.258 --> 16:11.221
Every star is a delicate balance between
the force of fusion going on in its core,...

16:11.305 --> 16:13.515
..which tends to wanna blow it apart,...

16:13.640 --> 16:18.520
..and the gravitational force of its mass,
which tends to wanna crush it into a ball.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.065
If we disrupt that balance
by removing some of the star's mass,...

16:22.191 --> 16:25.027
..we could create an artificial supernova.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.988
The blast wave would expand
at nearly the speed of light.

16:28.071 --> 16:31.491
It would destroy this system
within minutes.

16:31.617 --> 16:34.953
How are we supposed
to remove some of the star's mass?

16:36.497 --> 16:40.000
Well, uh, this is
gonna sound a little crazy,...

16:40.125 --> 16:43.378
..but we dial P3W-451 .

16:43.462 --> 16:46.715
It's the planet where
we encountered the black hole.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.133
Wow.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.345
- That sounds a little crazy.
- Yeah.

16:51.428 --> 16:55.349
We take the Stargate in the mother ship
and bring it as close to the sun as we can.

16:55.807 --> 17:01.230
Then we dial the black hole, enclose
the gate in a force field and jettison it.

17:01.313 --> 17:04.900
The sun's gravity will pull it in,
the force field will disintegrate...

17:04.983 --> 17:09.695
..and stellar matter will be sucked through
that wormhole like water through a hose.

17:09.820 --> 17:13.407
The gate won't last long,
but we figure it'll be long enough.

17:13.825 --> 17:20.165
Excuse me, wasn't the gate on P3W-451
sucked into the black hole long ago?

17:20.290 --> 17:23.961
Not necessarily. That planet
was probably ripped to pieces,...

17:24.086 --> 17:27.756
..but it can take years for matter
to spiral into the event horizon,...

17:27.839 --> 17:30.759
..especially given the time distortion.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.680
Either way, we'll know
when we try to dial out.

17:34.763 --> 17:38.892
If we can't make a connection, we abort
the plan and get the hell outta there.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.019
Whoa.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.147
Let me think about this a moment.

17:45.399 --> 17:48.193
You wanted to take
more direct measures, Jack.

17:48.277 --> 17:50.737
Council's already approved the plan.

17:53.532 --> 17:56.952
But it's your ship,
which means it's your call.

17:58.328 --> 17:59.788
Still thinking.

18:00.247 --> 18:04.168
Sir, this solar system is
completely abandoned and barren.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.171
Apophis's fleet is on the way.

18:07.546 --> 18:10.549
We may never have another
opportunity like this again.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.804
OK.

18:29.443 --> 18:31.320
Hey, Teal'c.

18:31.403 --> 18:35.073
I've been lookin' for you.
There's been a change of plans.

18:35.866 --> 18:39.203
I have been informed of
Major Carter's intentions.

18:43.624 --> 18:47.669
So you understand then that
there's nowhere for Tanith to run.

18:48.462 --> 18:51.256
This whole planet
is gonna be incinerated.

18:53.091 --> 18:56.053
If all goes according to plan, yes.

18:56.929 --> 18:59.723
What, you don't think we can pull it off?

19:00.599 --> 19:04.102
I have great confidence
in both Selmak and Major Carter.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.396
But?

19:06.897 --> 19:11.443
Twice I have had the opportunity
to avenge the murder of Shan'auc.

19:11.527 --> 19:14.613
Twice I have let Tanith
slip through my grasp.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.784
I have failed Shan'auc.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.328
That's not true.

19:22.120 --> 19:26.041
You let Tanith live so the Tok'ra
could use him, and it worked.

19:26.917 --> 19:32.756
Now we're gonna take down Apophis and
the largest Goa'uld fleet ever assembled.

19:34.258 --> 19:36.635
It will be a great victory.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.804
That's right.

19:39.304 --> 19:43.517
And yet, knowing what Apophis did
to Sha're, would you not trade it all...

19:43.600 --> 19:47.980
..for the opportunity to crush the life
from his throat with your bare hands?

19:53.986 --> 19:55.612
Well,...

19:56.530 --> 20:00.450
..l'd be lying to you if I said
I'd never thought about it, but...

20:01.326 --> 20:03.453
..that doesn't mean I'd do it,...

20:03.579 --> 20:06.832
..given a more rational option.

20:11.211 --> 20:14.965
In the future I will not
be capable of such restraint.

20:43.535 --> 20:47.789
All the Tok'ra have been evacuated and
the Stargate's loaded into the cargo bay.

20:47.873 --> 20:49.917
We're good to go.

20:53.128 --> 20:55.005
Oh!

20:58.550 --> 21:00.427
Shotgun.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.898
Setting course for the sun.

21:24.952 --> 21:28.205
I'm picking up the fleet
on long-range scanners.

21:29.081 --> 21:32.167
At current speed,
they'll be here in 68 minutes.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.628
The timing has to be precise.

21:34.753 --> 21:38.340
Close to the sun we'll slow to
5% light speed and release the gate.

21:38.757 --> 21:41.218
That should give us
enough time to get away.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.971
How much advance warning
is Apophis gonna have?

21:44.221 --> 21:47.391
They won't be able
to detect the gate on their screens.

21:47.516 --> 21:51.979
And they won't know Vorash
is deserted until they're in orbit.

21:52.062 --> 21:54.106
By then it'll be too late.

22:09.246 --> 22:11.123
(Jacob) We're in position.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.667
Slowing to 5% light speed.

22:16.503 --> 22:20.090
(Carter) Cargo bay's gravity
generators at maximum.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.850
Initiating remote dial-out sequence.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.988
Ready when you are.

22:51.497 --> 22:56.293
It worked. The gate
on P3W-451 is still active.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.462
Engaging force field.

23:00.839 --> 23:02.883
(exhales)

23:04.051 --> 23:06.345
- Something wrong?
- No.

23:08.805 --> 23:11.892
I've just never blown up a star before.

23:12.518 --> 23:15.771
Well, they say the first one's
always the hardest.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.609
I say that.

23:23.195 --> 23:25.489
Opening cargo-bay doors.

23:29.159 --> 23:31.036
Releasing the clamps.

23:39.086 --> 23:41.213
And the gate is away.

24:00.524 --> 24:03.443
Gate trajectory on course. All right.

24:04.236 --> 24:08.073
Time to go. Prepare for hyperspeed.

24:14.288 --> 24:16.498
(rumbling)

24:17.958 --> 24:20.919
- (explosions)
- What the hell was that?

24:31.263 --> 24:35.809
- What the hell was that?
- We're under attack. Teal'c, weapons.

24:43.984 --> 24:46.278
Shields are inoperative.

24:47.321 --> 24:50.073
It can't be Apophis. It's too soon.

24:50.574 --> 24:52.618
Acquiring target.

24:55.287 --> 24:57.581
It is an al-kesh.

24:58.582 --> 25:02.419
- A Goa'uld midrange bomber.
- It must have been cloaked.

25:02.836 --> 25:05.214
Weapons are charged. Returning fire.

25:13.764 --> 25:15.807
She's too quick.

25:19.353 --> 25:21.647
Here she comes again, Teal'c!

25:36.703 --> 25:38.747
Jacob?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.751
We've lost main power.

25:43.961 --> 25:46.004
Hyperdrive is down.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.759
We're sitting ducks.

26:06.316 --> 26:10.612
- Why haven't they finished us off?
- They may be just as damaged as we are.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.865
Hey, who's "they" anyway?

26:14.658 --> 26:16.535
I have no idea.

26:18.245 --> 26:20.372
Tactical indicators are down.

26:20.497 --> 26:23.750
- Weapons?
- Inoperable.

26:24.877 --> 26:28.547
- I'll have to go check it out.
- Hey! Whoa!

26:28.630 --> 26:32.551
- We've still got an enemy ship out there.
- When that gate reaches the sun...

26:32.634 --> 26:34.928
What if we get blown out of the sky?

26:35.053 --> 26:38.390
What do you want us to do, Jack?
We have no weapons or shields.

26:45.022 --> 26:47.482
Gliders. This ship's got gliders, right?

26:47.733 --> 26:49.610
Of course.

26:49.693 --> 26:51.570
Teal'c.

27:09.171 --> 27:13.300
The al-kesh has a significant advantage
in both size and armaments.

27:13.383 --> 27:16.011
Hey, nice preflight there.

27:16.094 --> 27:19.264
However, we have
superior manoeuvrability.

27:25.646 --> 27:27.606
All right. There she is.

27:28.690 --> 27:32.444
Jacob was right.
The ship appears to have been damaged.

27:33.278 --> 27:36.949
Well, let's put her out of her misery.
Powering weapons.

27:46.834 --> 27:49.211
What the hell?

27:49.711 --> 27:52.798
They appear to have
repaired their engines.

27:53.048 --> 27:56.051
Jack, what's happening out there?

27:56.134 --> 27:58.846
- They're breaking off.
- So let them go.

27:59.137 --> 28:02.724
O'Neill, the ship appears
to be headed for Vorash.

28:16.071 --> 28:18.115
Uh, Teal'c?

28:20.033 --> 28:22.494
We must not allow Tanith to escape.

28:28.292 --> 28:30.002
Uh, Teal'c...

28:30.085 --> 28:33.505
..thinks the ship might
be going to pick up Tanith.

28:34.840 --> 28:39.469
That makes sense, Jack. He probably
had a ship waiting nearby the whole time.

28:39.553 --> 28:41.513
That's why they got here so fast.

28:41.847 --> 28:45.517
Yeah, well, seems we're goin' after him.

28:49.605 --> 28:51.899
It's a Jaffa revenge thing.

28:52.858 --> 28:56.195
Sir, you only have
a little more than an hour.

28:56.320 --> 28:59.823
Ah, Carter, relax.
We'll be back in plenty oftime.

29:01.450 --> 29:05.120
Right, Teal'c?
We'll be back in plenty of time?

29:07.539 --> 29:09.416
Buddy?

29:10.667 --> 29:12.127
Pal?

29:12.211 --> 29:13.837
God.

29:19.218 --> 29:23.514
Sam, I'll need help with the hyperdrive.
Dr Jackson, you have the peltak.

29:24.389 --> 29:26.767
Uh, wha... what exactly does that mean?

29:26.892 --> 29:28.936
We'll stay in touch.

29:43.408 --> 29:45.536
Target is in range.

29:45.661 --> 29:48.539
Weapons locked.

29:49.540 --> 29:51.583
Here we go.

30:44.553 --> 30:46.430
Pull up, Teal'c. Pull up!

30:50.684 --> 30:54.438
(Jack) Mayday! Mayday!
We are so goin' in!

30:56.231 --> 30:58.192
Jack, can you hear me?

30:58.317 --> 31:00.027
(crackling)

31:00.152 --> 31:03.113
Jack, I'm not reading you.
What's happening?

31:05.324 --> 31:07.201
Jack!

31:22.508 --> 31:26.345
Main power's back on line.
Weapons and shields are operational.

31:26.428 --> 31:28.805
What about the hyperdrive?

31:31.433 --> 31:32.684
Hm.

31:32.768 --> 31:34.811
The control circuit is fried.

31:35.604 --> 31:40.901
The engines are fine, but we'll have
to reroute through secondary systems.

31:41.235 --> 31:45.072
- Well, how long will that take?
- We'll have to move fast.

31:45.906 --> 31:47.950
- (Daniel) Sam?
- Go ahead.

31:48.492 --> 31:50.702
I just got a Mayday from Jack.

31:51.787 --> 31:55.290
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know. I lost the transmission.

31:55.374 --> 31:57.417
Hang on. We have to go back for them.

31:57.543 --> 32:00.379
- We can't. Not now.
- Why not? We have sub-light speed.

32:00.546 --> 32:05.008
I know, but I'm the only one that can fly
this ship and I have to make these repairs.

32:05.092 --> 32:07.302
- Well, I'll do them.
- Sam...

32:07.511 --> 32:11.181
Look, we're not leaving them behind.
You can talk me through it.

32:11.890 --> 32:16.186
OK. You can start by
pulling out the burnt crystals.

32:45.382 --> 32:49.761
Propulsion system and communication
array have been damaged beyond repair.

32:49.887 --> 32:51.763
That's good.

32:51.889 --> 32:56.852
Because, according to my calculations,
we are roughly in the middle of...

32:56.935 --> 32:59.646
..nowhere. Give or take.

33:00.606 --> 33:05.402
The cruiser was going to pick up Tanith,
so we cannot be far from the Tok'ra base.

33:06.153 --> 33:10.782
If we make it there, Carter and Jackson
can ring us aboard the mother ship.

33:11.116 --> 33:16.163
You're assuming they're assuming we're
alive and they're coming back for us.

33:17.623 --> 33:20.083
Care to make a wager, O'Neill?

33:20.918 --> 33:22.961
On which part?

33:24.922 --> 33:26.965
I believe it is this way.

33:28.383 --> 33:32.387
This is so the last time
I help someone move.

33:35.432 --> 33:40.145
- Good, the tactical display's back on line.
- Yeah, I think we have a problem here.

33:40.229 --> 33:42.940
I figured that flashing wasn't good news.

33:43.023 --> 33:46.777
And the fact that in Goa'uld
it says "Warning. Warning."

33:47.778 --> 33:50.155
It's Apophis. He's here.

34:00.833 --> 34:06.380
He's ahead of schedule. The other ship
must've warned him to pick up the pace.

34:06.463 --> 34:09.091
- What are you doing?
- Retreating.

34:09.174 --> 34:11.217
What about Jack and Teal'c?

34:11.342 --> 34:14.596
Apophis's ships are taking up
attack positions around Vorash.

34:14.721 --> 34:17.724
They'd destroy us
before we even got close.

34:17.808 --> 34:22.353
I'm not going to abandon them, Daniel.
We need to buy more time.

34:22.437 --> 34:26.108
If we move around behind the sun,
the fleet won't spot us.

34:30.529 --> 34:32.822
Ah, this was a bad idea.

34:33.489 --> 34:38.620
I said that, remember? Remember
I said "General, this is a bad idea"?

34:38.745 --> 34:42.331
- I remember, O'Neill.
- "Let the Tok'ra get their own ship" I said.

34:42.456 --> 34:45.878
- They don't share with us.
- I remember.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.172
Yep, that's what I said.

34:48.297 --> 34:52.050
- How much time until the sun explodes?
- Huh? Oh.

34:52.551 --> 34:54.928
45 minutes.

34:55.053 --> 34:57.848
At least we have prevented
Tanith from escaping.

34:57.931 --> 35:00.642
Yes. At least we have that.

35:14.281 --> 35:17.868
Apophis sends his greetings
and bids you welcome upon his vessel.

35:18.202 --> 35:20.412
He is grateful for your service.

35:21.622 --> 35:25.542
There may still be one more thing
for which he can be grateful.

35:28.879 --> 35:32.633
- (Carter) OK, now what?
- Replace the last two crystals.

35:32.758 --> 35:36.428
The whole panel should light up
and you should hear a hum.

35:44.394 --> 35:47.481
Humming away. Hyperdrive's on line.

35:50.817 --> 35:53.529
It should be around here somewhere.

35:53.612 --> 35:56.323
Indeed. The rings are centred here.

35:57.616 --> 35:59.660
So? Now what?

36:59.845 --> 37:02.681
(Jacob) The Stargate just entered the sun.

37:02.764 --> 37:06.602
We only have 27 minutes
before it goes supernova.

37:06.768 --> 37:09.563
Why aren't we heading back to Vorash?

37:09.646 --> 37:13.233
Apophis is already there. There's
no way we can get near that planet.

37:13.317 --> 37:15.194
But we have to do something.

37:16.695 --> 37:21.158
Apophis wants the Tok'ra,
so let's give them to him.

37:33.378 --> 37:36.381
- You are injured.
- I will be fine.

37:39.009 --> 37:41.136
Where are the Tok'ra?

37:41.220 --> 37:43.514
The attempt to stop
their ship was thwarted.

37:43.639 --> 37:49.978
However, I managed to procure a gift
which will make the journey worthwhile.

37:50.687 --> 37:52.981
(footsteps)

38:07.454 --> 38:09.748
The shol'va.

38:14.711 --> 38:17.005
You have done well.

38:23.095 --> 38:26.181
Remote guidance engaged.
Launching gliders.

38:39.778 --> 38:44.825
Lord Apophis, scanners have picked up
gliders moving out from behind the sun.

38:46.160 --> 38:48.203
Surround them.

38:49.496 --> 38:53.417
The fleet is on course. They're heading
out of the system. Speed increasing.

38:54.084 --> 38:56.128
He's taking the bait.

38:57.671 --> 38:59.715
The fleet is leaving Vorash.

39:04.678 --> 39:07.472
We are approaching the enemy ships.

39:08.307 --> 39:12.311
My Lord, there are no life signs.
The ships are unmanned.

39:13.937 --> 39:15.981
A trick.

39:22.488 --> 39:26.408
Sensors are picking up a Hatak
now approaching the planet.

39:36.752 --> 39:40.172
Less than four minutes
before the sun begins to supernova.

39:43.383 --> 39:45.928
- (Daniel) Jack, come in.
- (crackling)

39:48.055 --> 39:50.015
Jack, come in.

39:50.140 --> 39:51.934
Yeah, I'm here.

39:52.059 --> 39:54.102
Hey, thanks for checkin' in.

39:54.228 --> 39:59.191
Yeah, we had trouble avoiding Apophis's
fleet. Are you in position to be ringed up?

39:59.316 --> 40:02.820
Uh, yeah, I suppose. I don't know.

40:03.695 --> 40:08.659
- Jack, ifyou're not in position...
- Daniel, just get me the hell outta here!

40:19.294 --> 40:22.548
- We gotta get out of here.
- If my calculations were correct...

40:34.434 --> 40:36.478
Arm the weapons.

40:37.187 --> 40:39.231
My Lord...

40:47.156 --> 40:48.949
Engaging hyperdrive.

41:10.137 --> 41:12.431
What just happened?

41:12.514 --> 41:16.351
We must have caught
the tail end of the blast wave.

41:17.186 --> 41:19.229
It knocked us off course.

41:22.608 --> 41:24.485
Sir.

41:25.611 --> 41:27.738
Where's Teal'c?

41:27.821 --> 41:29.781
I'm not sure.

41:29.907 --> 41:31.950
I think he's dead.

41:37.122 --> 41:40.209
- If Apophis has him...
- Well, we have to go back.

41:40.792 --> 41:43.086
That may not be possible, Sam.

41:44.296 --> 41:48.133
The navigational computer isn't
recognising any of the star patterns.

41:48.800 --> 41:51.637
According to these readings,...

41:51.720 --> 41:54.431
..we've travelled over
four million light years.

41:54.515 --> 41:58.560
- That's impossible.
- We're not even in our own galaxy.

41:58.644 --> 42:02.564
The explosion must have somehow
affected the subspace window.

42:02.940 --> 42:06.193
Wait a minute. What are you saying?
We can't get back?

42:06.527 --> 42:10.989
I don't know. This ship isn't
normally capable of going so fast.

42:11.114 --> 42:13.325
It only took us a few seconds to get here.

42:13.867 --> 42:17.955
Given our current position,
and maximum hyperdrive speed,...

42:18.038 --> 42:21.291
..it's gonna take us 125 years to get back.

42:26.964 --> 42:30.551
Long-range sensors
are picking up another ship.

42:38.350 --> 42:40.394
It's Apophis.
