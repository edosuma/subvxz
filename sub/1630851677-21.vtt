I have felt it.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.749
How many people on this Earth
can say that?

12:29.792 --> 12:31.838
And no,

12:31.881 --> 12:34.971
I don't think
your rage is a joke.

12:37.191 --> 12:39.367
I know it more than anyone.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.935
Let's see how much
we're the same.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.329
I'm not going to hurt you.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.943
Just tell me what comes
into your head

12:49.986 --> 12:51.858
as I do this.

12:54.643 --> 12:57.777
PEMBROOK:
Don't cry.

12:57.820 --> 13:02.216
Crying causes pain.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.566
How do I not cry?

13:04.609 --> 13:06.394
Like I've been
telling you.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.352
Don't feel.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.963
Remember?

13:10.006 --> 13:13.575
Feelings cause pain.

13:21.365 --> 13:24.673
Tell me, what are
you thinking now?

13:26.675 --> 13:28.590
You're wearing his cologne.

13:28.633 --> 13:31.027
Shulton Pierre Cardin.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.552
You found it?

13:34.596 --> 13:37.555
It took a while.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.820
That smell haunted me.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.693
I wear it every day now.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.435
Why would you do that?

13:47.478 --> 13:49.393
So I got used to it.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.181
I can't smell it anymore.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.532
I understand.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.142
[exhales]

13:59.186 --> 14:00.927
My God.
[sniffles]

14:00.970 --> 14:02.972
I haven't cried
since I was a child.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.932
"Feelings cause pain."

14:10.980 --> 14:13.156
[laughs softly]

14:13.200 --> 14:15.071
You are my brother.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.294
What you're saying doesn't
make any sense, Joelle.

14:20.337 --> 14:21.730
You've been studying
this woman for years,

14:21.773 --> 14:22.992
and you know nothing about her?

14:23.036 --> 14:24.820
I'm telling you the truth.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.648
No, you're not.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.999
Your old colleagues in the CIA

14:30.043 --> 14:32.959
tell me that they've been
feeding you intelligence

14:33.002 --> 14:35.918
on Katya Miranova for years.

14:35.962 --> 14:40.009
Look, I... I did search for her.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.272
But it was destroying me.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.448
The agency has
had me talk to some...

14:44.492 --> 14:46.668
really good people.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.452
They're trying to help me.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.584
Psychiatrists?

14:49.627 --> 14:50.890
Yes.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.543
I am fighting
really hard

14:52.587 --> 14:54.806
to try to put this
all behind me.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.765
FATIMA:
Sorry to interrupt,

14:56.808 --> 14:58.462
but I need to show you
both something.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.468
Yes, Agent Namazi.
What do you have?

15:04.512 --> 15:06.644
So, a block away from
the stakeout, I found this van

15:06.688 --> 15:09.299
leaving ten minutes
after the power went out.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.562
Now, it's the only van
I've found without windows.

15:11.606 --> 15:15.088
And I ran the plates. It was
reported stolen two days ago.

15:15.131 --> 15:17.525
We need to find that van.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.744
Kaleidoscope's working on it,
and a BOLO with LAPD.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.268
Let us know as soon
as you find anything.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.052
There's something else.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.967
Okay, I've been trying
to reach Anna,

15:25.011 --> 15:27.448
but she's not responding
to her calls or texts.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.537
Arkady has an emergency code
set up with her,

15:29.580 --> 15:31.582
but she's not responding to that
either.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.062
Keep trying.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.716
Of course.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.761
I, um...

15:36.805 --> 15:39.503
not sure I'm buying
Joelle's story.

15:41.636 --> 15:44.160
Yeah. Maybe we
should cut her loose.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.901
Put a tracker on her car.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.468
See what she does.Yeah.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.035
I'll take care of it.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.471
Agent Hanna.

15:51.689 --> 15:52.690
I know

15:52.734 --> 15:54.692
that you lost your wife

15:54.736 --> 15:56.172
in a situation like this.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.697
We're gonna get
your partner back.

15:59.741 --> 16:02.744
Right. Of course.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.270
[door opens]

16:07.314 --> 16:08.141
[door closes]

16:09.838 --> 16:11.927
Think about it.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.624
We could find him together.

16:16.671 --> 16:19.065
You'd never work with me.

16:19.108 --> 16:21.371
You'd never just let me
walk away.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.680
The things I've done
can't be excused.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.595
If we find Pembrook,

16:27.638 --> 16:29.379
you know what I'll do to him.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.598
Of course.

16:30.641 --> 16:31.947
It means

16:31.991 --> 16:34.515
I'll have blood
on my hands, too.

16:34.558 --> 16:36.212
Katya,

16:36.256 --> 16:38.084
you and I will put the gun
in his mouth

16:38.127 --> 16:39.999
and pull the trigger together.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.914
You'll have that
over me forever.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.568
I'll not only let you walk away,

16:44.612 --> 16:45.874
I'll help you start over.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.530
It will be a way

16:49.573 --> 16:52.228
for both of us to be fixed.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.145
[scoffs]

16:56.189 --> 16:58.756
I can never be fixed.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.065
I still want
to hurt you too much

17:03.109 --> 17:04.023
for taking Anna away from me.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.592
I'll find Pembrook myself.

[door bangs]

17:20.213 --> 17:21.997
[doors open]

17:22.041 --> 17:23.085
This is where
I found the black van.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.218
Parking lot on
Spring and West 4th.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.436
Everybody on the way?

17:26.480 --> 17:27.829
As we speak.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.056
Talk to me.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.579
Already scanned
for explosives.

17:38.622 --> 17:39.406
Ready?

17:43.540 --> 17:45.107
[beeps]

17:45.151 --> 17:46.848
There's cameras.
They can see us?

17:46.891 --> 17:49.677
We're watching.
Hey, party people.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.113
Where's Deeks?

17:51.157 --> 17:52.549
And the chick
with the keffiyeh.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.508
She's sexy.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.423
It's not a party unless
everyone's invited.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.555
Mm-hmm.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.166
Fatima, can you trace
the signal coming to the van?

18:00.209 --> 18:03.212
Uh, tell Sexy Keffiyeh
not to bother.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.040
You have to understand,
brother--

18:05.084 --> 18:07.086
you just fell down
the rabbit hole.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.611
Signals can't reach down
a rabbit hole this deep.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.700
♪

18:23.711 --> 18:27.845
Can you trace the origin of the
signal that was sent to the van?

18:27.889 --> 18:30.587
No. They stopped
too quickly.[sighs]

18:30.631 --> 18:32.981
Katya's taken this deepfake
to a whole other level.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.896
We cannot trust anything
going forward, guys.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.332
[beeping]

18:36.376 --> 18:37.899
The tracker
you put on Joelle's car

18:37.942 --> 18:40.031
just led to a building
on East 24th Street.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.207
SAM:
Send me the address.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.947
Get into the
security cameras,

the floor

18:44.340 --> 18:46.342
and the exact
office she went to.

Check this van, see if
you can find anything.

Anna.
You must know that.

I know I'm a broken toy, but...

if my love for you,

19:13.239 --> 19:15.502
my complete desire for you
isn't clear,

19:15.545 --> 19:18.548
then I really have no insight
into human relations.

19:20.637 --> 19:24.337
And you think that kidnapping me
and handcuffing me is love?

19:24.380 --> 19:25.773
[breathing heavily]

19:25.816 --> 19:27.296
Maybe
the handcuff part.

19:29.429 --> 19:30.734
Katya,

19:30.778 --> 19:33.084
we were together
for a short time,

19:33.128 --> 19:35.304
in prison, a
long time ago.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.611
The happiest time
of my life.

19:37.654 --> 19:40.962
ANNA:
I'm sorry that the rest
of your life has been so hard.

19:41.005 --> 19:43.007

You can change that.

19:43.051 --> 19:44.270
Play her.

19:47.403 --> 19:48.926
I have a life.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.537
I can't just...

19:50.580 --> 19:52.756
Why has it taken you so long
to say yes to Callen?

19:54.236 --> 19:56.412
I know you want
to separate from him.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.500
It's always on-again,

19:57.544 --> 19:58.632
off-again.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.242
Why can't you just embrace

20:00.286 --> 20:02.418
that you are still
in love with me?

20:05.291 --> 20:07.728
ANNA:
It's not about love. It's...

20:10.121 --> 20:13.429
I've had a hard time coming
to terms with my bisexuality.

20:14.778 --> 20:15.953
I...

20:17.172 --> 20:19.566
I did love our time together.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.874
KATYA:
You loved our time together?

20:23.918 --> 20:25.224
Or you loved me?

20:27.791 --> 20:29.358
Did you?

20:30.838 --> 20:32.970
Do you love me?

20:37.627 --> 20:40.543
I did. I...

20:42.197 --> 20:44.591
I do think about you.

I have her entering

on your left.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.051
You sure she's in there?

21:10.094 --> 21:12.836
She's in there. We haven't seen
her exit on any of the cameras.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.449
Joelle, I'm coming in
one way or the other.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.321
How'd you find me?

21:19.365 --> 21:21.584
I pulled two
of your trackers off my car.

21:21.628 --> 21:23.804
That's because I put
four trackers on your car.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.240
You're not getting
out of my sight again.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.197
Please,
even with one leg,

21:26.241 --> 21:27.851
I can get away from you.

How long
you been tracking Katya for?

Two months.

Let me guess, this is
my partner's side hustle.

just tracking Katya.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.831
We were tracking
Pembrook as well.

21:50.874 --> 21:53.442
Of course. 'Cause you want to
handle the situation yourselves,

21:53.486 --> 21:55.836
outside of the oversight
of NCIS, huh?

The law can get in the way
of a really good time.

Okay.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.589

All right.

22:09.632 --> 22:12.243
We got hits on Katya's aliases
from credit cards.

22:12.287 --> 22:13.636
Mm-hmm.That led to vehicles,

22:13.680 --> 22:15.595
which led
to traffic camera footage.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.901
She changes her look,

I was just working on

types of businesses

in the vicinity of where
Katya parks her car.

She was spotted twice
within two blocks

22:29.565 --> 22:31.698
of a shipping container
rental company.

22:31.741 --> 22:34.265
Katya's operatives kept you
in a shipping container.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.658
Also where
they kept Anna.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.573
I mean, it's good a place
to start as any.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.183
What's the name of the company?

22:39.227 --> 22:40.968
Cargo Blue Incorporated.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.491
Cargo Blue.

22:44.841 --> 22:46.016
There's nothing here.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.714
I'm not surprised.
She's smart.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.629
She wouldn't leave
anything behind.

22:49.672 --> 22:53.589
Okay, everything we've found so
far is most likely a deepfake.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.287
Right.The footage of Callen
walking away from his car.

22:56.331 --> 22:57.376
Callen's beatdown.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.160
It-It's all manufactured.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.770
Katya led us to the office.

She led us
to the van.

23:02.642 --> 23:03.991
This whole thing is planned.
So the more we follow her,

23:04.034 --> 23:05.819
the further away we get.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.603
Okay, well, if it's all made-up,
then what do we look for?

23:07.647 --> 23:11.041
I think the point is
we don't move forward,

23:11.085 --> 23:12.434
because that's her leading us.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.131

Exactly, Agent Blye.
