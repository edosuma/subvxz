I've seen enough of the Galaxy

02:47.584 --> 02:49.951

- A hit song?
- We can't possibly --

02:59.888 --> 03:01.879
- You mean like Vivaldi?
- No, Frasier.

03:01.973 --> 03:05.386
A live performance of a newly
written, catchy original song.

The-Dream?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.773
You people
haven't heard of The-Dream?

possibly Scandinavian.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.560
I'm just gonna come out

04:31.646 --> 04:32.886
the old gods are dead.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.473
Fuck all previous
existing religions.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.935
The giant head
in the sky.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.566
- Children of God!
- Ah-ta-ta-ta!

04:41.656 --> 04:42.896
Bob, Bob, I get it.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.574
But unless <i>this</i>

04:45.660 --> 04:47.492

done for me lately?

04:47.579 --> 04:48.785
So,
if you'll all excuse me,

04:48.872 --> 04:50.488
I'm going out
onto the sidewalk,

04:50.582 --> 04:52.698
I'm dropping to my knees,
and pledging my eternal soul

04:52.793 --> 04:55.455
to the thing that literally
controls the fucking weather.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.910
Out of my way.

04:57.005 --> 04:57.995
Okay.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.503
If sanity's been restored
to this assembly,

05:01.593 --> 05:04.927
I'd like to talk about the cost
of repairing our new organ.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.549
Sally, the plate,

Giant head in the sky, please
forgive all that we've done.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.524

increased levels of emissions

05:26.618 --> 05:28.575

All right, Morty.

Why don't you, uh, find a button

some kind of beat?

failure, Morty.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.061

than regular planning.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.138

Listen.

left in this thing.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.359
If we portal home
from here and back,

09:31.446 --> 09:33.312
we're not gonna have enough
charge left to get off world.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.362
- Get it?
- What?!

09:34.449 --> 09:35.655
- Yeah.
- You see?

09:35.742 --> 09:36.903
I try to shelter you

09:36.993 --> 09:38.324
from certain realities,
Morty,

09:38.411 --> 09:39.776
because if I let you
make me nervous,

09:39.871 --> 09:41.407
then we can't
get schwifty.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.614
Stop saying it like
it's a thing! You made it up!

09:43.708 --> 09:45.073
Hey, Morty,
could you lick my...

09:45.168 --> 09:46.624
<i>balls, balls...</i>

09:46.711 --> 09:48.327
Rick, cut it out!
It's not funny, Rick!

09:48.421 --> 09:51.083
I've seen enough.
These guys are one-hit wonders.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.414
And what's your plan,
General?

09:52.509 --> 09:53.795
We still have
the nuclear option.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.922
On my word,
we can launch a missile

09:56.012 --> 09:58.094
at every one
of those heads in the sky.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.468
Our planet's held captive
on a live game show,

10:00.558 --> 10:02.094
and your solution
is to shoot the audience?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.392
You can put your faith in nukes
if we get through this, General.

10:04.479 --> 10:07.096
Until then, I'll put mine
in Rick and Morty.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.682
"Get Schwifty"
was a jam.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.767
Hello?
Yes, sir, yeah.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.351
Eh, thank you, sir.
Thank you.

of what we're doing

10:15.907 --> 10:19.525

a great ascension festival!

Happy ascension!

10:21.955 --> 10:23.821
We should pack up
and leave town now.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.657
I think it's inspiring that our
community is coping with fear

10:26.751 --> 10:29.038
in a way that involves a
festival and homemade ice cream.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.416
If you'd stop being
such an evangelical atheist,

10:31.506 --> 10:33.372

10:33.466 --> 10:34.956
Whoa!
Look at you!

You're wearing the hat

10:38.054 --> 10:40.091
Mom, do you mind
if I cook dinner tonight?

10:40.181 --> 10:42.138
Yeah, sure.
Wait. What?

10:42.225 --> 10:44.887
I love you guys.
You gave me life.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.594
And it's the will
of the many Heads

10:46.688 --> 10:48.725
that all children
honor their parents.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.101

10:50.191 --> 10:51.647
Pardon,
Mr. And Mrs. Smith.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.566
Summer, are you
coming to the ascension?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.894
Father, can we please
go to the ascension?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.696
Sure!
Let's go to the ascension.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.943
Wh-Wh-What is it?

10:59.033 --> 11:01.149
We hereby send these
unwantables skyward

11:01.244 --> 11:03.781

by the many Heads,

11:03.872 --> 11:06.955

as better babies.

11:07.041 --> 11:12.662
Headward,
free now to rise.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.417
Oh, yes! Yes!
Rise to the giant Head!

You are free
to be free!

from the garage, right?

in one hand,
