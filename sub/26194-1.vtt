Sister Catherine, I come
on behalf of the devil.

00:40.256 --> 00:42.923
You are an enemy of
Satan and you will burn

00:42.925 --> 00:44.802
with hellfire if you
do not cooperate.

[ominous music]

01:42.610 --> 01:43.444
Get out!

01:50.952 --> 01:52.826

Too far.

Hey, 21.09.

Here you go.

03:56.118 --> 03:56.992
Thanks.

03:56.994 --> 03:57.828
Have a good one.

04:01.082 --> 04:01.916
Wait.

04:04.126 --> 04:05.334
21.09.

04:05.336 --> 04:06.838
You gave me 21.06.

04:08.880 --> 04:09.881
It's three cents.

04:14.511 --> 04:16.053
I don't have three cents.

04:32.946 --> 04:34.196
[Mike] Want some
help with that?

04:34.198 --> 04:35.531
No, I think I got it.

04:35.533 --> 04:36.365
Are you sure?

04:36.367 --> 04:37.199
Ooh, pizza!

[Anna giggling]

04:47.211 --> 04:48.252
Done?

04:48.254 --> 04:49.338
I think so.

04:50.422 --> 04:51.340
Thank God.

04:53.050 --> 04:55.259
Can't believe your aunt
let us stay here this long.

04:55.261 --> 04:56.843
She has three houses.

04:56.845 --> 04:58.553
She probably forgot
we were here.

04:58.555 --> 05:00.264
God, three houses.

05:00.266 --> 05:02.477
I'm excited to finally
have one house.

05:03.727 --> 05:06.269
You didn't think
it would happen.

05:06.271 --> 05:07.147
I didn't.

05:08.523 --> 05:10.774
We've come a long way.

05:10.776 --> 05:13.320
That is an understatement.

05:15.364 --> 05:16.738
[Anna] [laughing]
Where did you find this?

05:16.740 --> 05:18.324
[Mike] Your sister
gave it to me.

05:18.326 --> 05:20.117
Can we lose it in the move?

05:20.119 --> 05:22.370
No, you'd regret it.

05:22.372 --> 05:23.581
Yeah, maybe you would.

05:24.456 --> 05:26.750
[laughing]

05:30.629 --> 05:33.757
You're not gonna make me, like,

05:35.218 --> 05:37.593
change my look or
anything, right?

05:37.595 --> 05:40.682
Like, ditch the nose
ring, go blonde?

05:42.225 --> 05:43.807
Are you serious?

05:43.809 --> 05:47.478
I mean, we're moving to
such a nice neighborhood,

05:47.480 --> 05:49.982
and your position's so big, I...

05:54.487 --> 05:55.321
Never.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.532
That's who I married.

05:59.701 --> 06:01.451
Just don't go back
to the '08 look.

06:02.996 --> 06:03.830
Deal.

Hey, Anna, it's Lex.

06:36.194 --> 06:37.070
Uh, call me.

06:38.364 --> 06:39.780
I heard you and Mike are finally

06:39.782 --> 06:41.531
moving out of his aunt's house.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.367
I know I shouldn't be calling,

06:43.369 --> 06:47.370
but I'd like to see Claire
before you move out.

06:47.372 --> 06:48.538
Gettin' cleaned up, you know,

06:48.540 --> 06:51.374
and I don't care
what some judge says,

06:51.376 --> 06:53.670
she's my daughter
too, and I've got a.

06:54.672 --> 06:57.258
[uneasy music]

07:13.398 --> 07:14.900
Claire?

07:16.026 --> 07:18.320
Hmm, where is she?

07:19.321 --> 07:21.574
She's got a big day tomorrow.

07:23.158 --> 07:25.118
Maybe she's under here!

07:26.746 --> 07:29.332
No, hmm.

07:30.499 --> 07:33.211
What about in here?

07:35.004 --> 07:35.838
No.

07:36.756 --> 07:38.465
I hear something though.

07:39.759 --> 07:43.177
Maybe she's under here!

07:52.230 --> 07:53.064
Mom?

07:54.523 --> 07:56.064
Well you're a good hider.

07:56.066 --> 07:57.442
I wasn't hiding.

07:58.653 --> 07:59.487
Sure.

08:03.783 --> 08:04.699
[giggling]

08:04.701 --> 08:06.742
Did you brush your teeth?

08:06.744 --> 08:08.201
Perfect.

08:08.203 --> 08:11.038
Are you excited to move
into your own room tomorrow?

08:11.040 --> 08:12.288
Very!

08:12.290 --> 08:14.709
Can you believe it,
your very own room?

08:14.711 --> 08:16.293
This is my own room.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.963
No, not some old guest
room, your own room.

08:18.965 --> 08:21.467
One that you can decorate
however you want.

08:22.718 --> 08:24.175
I'm just glad I
don't have to sleep

08:24.177 --> 08:27.014
on the floor like I
did in the old house.

08:28.307 --> 08:29.141
Me too.

08:30.393 --> 08:31.684
[thumping]

08:31.686 --> 08:34.312
Oh, Daddy dropped
something again.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.437
Again?

08:35.438 --> 08:37.355
He's clumsy, isn't he?

08:37.357 --> 08:38.441
[laughing]

08:38.443 --> 08:40.025
Goodnight, love bug.

08:40.027 --> 08:40.861
Night.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.533
[thumping]

08:48.535 --> 08:49.619
Jesus, Mike.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.538
What?

08:52.540 --> 08:53.496
[Anna] Was that you?

08:53.498 --> 08:54.831
Was what me?

08:54.833 --> 08:56.917
Did you knock something over?

08:56.919 --> 08:58.336
Not this time.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.754
Comin' to bed?

08:59.756 --> 09:01.839
Yeah, one sec.

09:38.835 --> 09:40.086
You asshole!

09:40.088 --> 09:41.796
I didn't mean to scare you.

09:41.798 --> 09:42.754
Yes you did!

09:42.756 --> 09:43.589
I swear I didn't.

09:43.591 --> 09:44.506
Yeah, okay.

09:44.508 --> 09:45.550
Yeah, okay.

09:46.593 --> 09:47.634
You know what?

09:47.636 --> 09:49.554
Better watch your back, Michael.

09:52.308 --> 09:53.224
Watch my back?

09:53.226 --> 09:54.350
[Anna] Mhmm.

09:54.352 --> 09:55.393
Michael?

09:55.395 --> 09:56.980
Am I actually in trouble?

10:00.024 --> 10:03.277

[toilet flushing]

10:36.602 --> 10:39.230
[ominous music]

10:41.899 --> 10:43.443
I thought of a way to repay you.

10:45.987 --> 10:48.403
[laughing]

10:48.405 --> 10:49.239
Oh my God.

10:54.161 --> 10:55.119
[Mike] You know,
I think Claire's

10:55.121 --> 10:56.164
really excited about tomorrow.

10:58.333 --> 10:59.831
Yeah, I know.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.878
I'm just still not sure about
this private school thing.

11:04.046 --> 11:05.672
What's wrong with
private school?

11:06.882 --> 11:08.548
Private school's
like second place

11:08.550 --> 11:10.467
awkward to home school.

11:10.469 --> 11:11.594
[laughing]

11:11.596 --> 11:12.845
I went to private school.

11:12.847 --> 11:14.639
Yeah, and look at
you, you're a mess.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.307
Mmm, yeah.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.519
[laughing]

11:20.438 --> 11:22.814
You know, it's not too
late to change your mind.

11:24.275 --> 11:25.774
Nah.

11:25.776 --> 11:28.112
I mean their gifted program
is supposed to be amazing.

11:29.488 --> 11:31.574
They'll give her the
attention she needs there.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.034
I still think you should
have gone to a gifted school.

11:36.036 --> 11:37.286
As if!

11:37.288 --> 11:40.373
No, no Claire did not
get her brains from me.

11:40.375 --> 11:42.460
She sure as hell didn't
get 'em from her dad.

11:43.377 --> 11:46.253
[uneasy music]

11:46.255 --> 11:47.090
I'm sorry.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.756
I didn't mean to bring him up.

11:49.758 --> 11:53.760
No, um, it's actually interesting
that you mention him.

11:53.762 --> 11:55.471
He's not calling again, is he?

11:55.473 --> 11:57.597
No, no, nothing like that.

11:57.599 --> 11:59.351
Um, I don't know.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.477
Stuff with the move is
just reminding me of him

12:02.479 --> 12:05.941
and all that shit with the
divorce and then going to rehab.

12:07.944 --> 12:10.403
And I'm just realizing
how far I've come.

12:10.405 --> 12:11.736
It's a good thing, right?

12:11.738 --> 12:13.156
Of course, yes.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.283
I guess it's just hard to stop

12:17.285 --> 12:19.622
associating yourself
with all that.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.206
The only thing
you need to worry

12:23.208 --> 12:25.837
about now is moving
past all that.

12:28.296 --> 12:30.172
Maybe I should go blonde.

12:30.174 --> 12:31.631
[laughing]

12:31.633 --> 12:32.674
Be my trophy wife?

12:32.676 --> 12:33.801
Yeah.

12:33.803 --> 12:35.302
[laughing]

12:35.304 --> 12:37.178
I think I've always been
a blonde on the inside.

12:37.180 --> 12:38.639
Oh, totally.

12:38.641 --> 12:43.311
A very very very dark blonde.

12:43.313 --> 12:45.312
- Mhmm.
- Mhmm.

12:45.314 --> 12:47.566
[laughing]

[birds chirping]

12:55.241 --> 12:56.615
What, no scrubs?

12:56.617 --> 12:58.451
[Mike] Nah, I wanna
look professional.

12:58.453 --> 13:00.911
Yeah, but I like that whole
hunky medical show vibe.

13:00.913 --> 13:01.745
Oh yeah?

13:01.747 --> 13:02.580
Mhmm.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.123
[laughing]

13:04.125 --> 13:05.499
Well, get to work.

13:05.501 --> 13:06.958
Those damn teeth
don't pull themselves.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.960
They better not.

13:07.962 --> 13:09.628
Meet ya at the new house at six?

13:09.630 --> 13:11.672
Yeah, yeah, I'll drive
the moving truck over.

13:11.674 --> 13:13.090
Perfect.

13:13.092 --> 13:14.841
Are you ready for my Aunt Donna?

13:14.843 --> 13:16.509
Oh yeah, and I've
got a gun in my purse

13:16.511 --> 13:18.220
in case she gets too feisty.

13:18.222 --> 13:20.475
[laughing]

13:21.934 --> 13:22.850
[Mike] There she is.

13:22.852 --> 13:27.480
Look at you!

13:27.482 --> 13:28.605
You excited?

13:28.607 --> 13:29.440
Yeah.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.441
Don't be shy.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.942
I know.

13:31.944 --> 13:33.860
Being shy's the last thing
she's gotta worry about.

13:33.862 --> 13:36.113
Yeah, well, you
didn't get that from me.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.197
[laughing]

13:37.199 --> 13:38.948
Goodbye, love you.

13:38.950 --> 13:41.034
I love you too.

13:41.036 --> 13:43.455
[soft music]

13:45.208 --> 13:46.039
You ready?

13:46.041 --> 13:47.376
[Claire] Yeah.

14:02.849 --> 14:05.519
[phone ringing]

14:07.646 --> 14:09.732
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[doorbell ringing]

14:45.517 --> 14:46.517
Oh thank God you're here.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.934
I can never find the right key.

14:47.936 --> 14:49.937
I'm Donna Winslow,
I'm Michael's aunt.

14:49.939 --> 14:50.939
Yeah, we've met.

14:51.857 --> 14:53.190
Many times.

14:53.192 --> 14:55.860
I'm here to check the
house before you go.

14:55.862 --> 14:58.195
Sure, um, well
I just need to...

14:58.197 --> 15:01.157
I'm in a hurry, I
left my dog in the car.

15:01.159 --> 15:02.408
Oh, okay.

15:02.410 --> 15:04.746
Um, well can you start upstairs?

15:06.204 --> 15:09.291
It's my house, I'll
start where I want.

15:16.214 --> 15:18.591
[keys jingling]

15:18.593 --> 15:21.052
On second thought,
turn on my AC.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.347
I want to be thorough.

15:32.649 --> 15:34.023
[thumping]

15:34.025 --> 15:34.858
Oh no.

15:36.234 --> 15:37.152
Oh no, what?

15:38.945 --> 15:41.238
Uh, was that you
in the spare room?

15:41.240 --> 15:42.530
I was in the office.

15:42.532 --> 15:44.700
The paint on the
wall is chipped.

15:44.702 --> 15:47.370
It costs $55 to repaint it.

15:47.372 --> 15:49.080
I'll need that by Thursday.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.873
[thumping]

15:50.875 --> 15:52.585
That better not
be a busted pipe.

15:54.587 --> 15:55.922
The hardwood is scuffed.

15:56.923 --> 15:59.423
It will cost $200 to fix it.

15:59.425 --> 16:00.801
I'll need that by Thursday.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.891
Don't forget your dishes.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.308
They'll need to be
out by Thursday.

16:10.310 --> 16:13.269
So between the paint,
the writing on the wall,

16:13.271 --> 16:14.437
the hardwood...

16:14.439 --> 16:15.690
Whoa, what
writing on the wall?

16:15.692 --> 16:16.606
In the guestroom.

16:16.608 --> 16:17.607
There's crayon on the wall.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.402
What, no, I was just in there.

16:19.404 --> 16:20.862
I didn't see anything.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.783
[thumping]

16:26.785 --> 16:28.284
I'm calling my
maintenance guy.

16:28.286 --> 16:30.037
You will be here all day, right?

16:30.039 --> 16:31.746
I don't like having
him here alone.

16:31.748 --> 16:32.999
Do I need to be?

16:33.001 --> 16:34.833
I kinda have to be at
the new house by six.

16:34.835 --> 16:37.045
Yes, I'll have
him come at 6:30.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.051
Oh God.

16:45.012 --> 16:47.681

17:14.834 --> 17:17.625
[phone buzzing]

17:17.627 --> 17:18.669
Hello?

17:18.671 --> 17:19.502
[Lex] Anna!

17:19.503 --> 17:20.337
Oh my God, finally.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.172
Uh...

17:21.174 --> 17:22.008
Shit.

17:22.925 --> 17:25.595
[groaning] God!

17:56.626 --> 17:59.295

Somebody help!

20:00.832 --> 20:01.708
Get me out!

20:03.502 --> 20:04.670
Somebody help!

20:10.550 --> 20:11.468
Let me out!

20:13.053 --> 20:15.055
Please, I can't breathe!

20:16.390 --> 20:17.224
Help!

20:24.898 --> 20:25.899
Please help!

20:28.194 --> 20:30.488

20:38.370 --> 20:41.122
[gasping]

20:41.124 --> 20:43.584
[eerie music]

20:55.722 --> 20:57.179
[Man] Barney's Pizza,
what can I get ya?

20:57.181 --> 20:58.221
What?

20:58.223 --> 20:59.056
[Man] Hello?

20:59.058 --> 21:00.223
No, I need help.

21:00.225 --> 21:01.683
[Man] Wait a second,
you're the lady

21:01.685 --> 21:02.893
who didn't pay for her food!

21:02.895 --> 21:03.894
What?

21:03.896 --> 21:05.690
[Man] You know, I came
up short because of you.

21:08.776 --> 21:09.775
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

21:09.777 --> 21:11.027
Hello, hello, I need help.

21:11.029 --> 21:13.403
My name is Anna Winter, I'm at...

21:13.405 --> 21:14.404
[Man] Didn't your
mother teach you

21:14.406 --> 21:15.865
not to hang up on people?

21:15.867 --> 21:17.325
Listen, asshole!

21:17.327 --> 21:19.743
[Evil Voice] No, you
listen, you little bitch!

21:19.745 --> 21:23.247
You deserve what's
coming to you.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.749
Who is this?

21:24.751 --> 21:26.791
[Evil Voice]
Stay with me, Anna.

21:26.793 --> 21:29.586
Don't leave me
like you left Lex.

21:29.588 --> 21:31.380
Lex almost killed me.

21:31.382 --> 21:33.089
[Evil Voice] It's
a shame he didn't.

21:33.091 --> 21:35.259
[phone sizzling]

21:35.261 --> 21:36.095

21:51.569 --> 21:52.444

22:03.164 --> 22:03.998
Help!

22:07.417 --> 22:08.251
Help!

22:10.754 --> 22:15.423
Help! [coughing]

22:15.425 --> 22:16.260
Help!

22:18.221 --> 22:19.055
Help!

22:22.975 --> 22:23.809
Help!

22:27.480 --> 22:29.691
[coughing]

22:32.318 --> 22:33.485
Somebody help.

22:35.029 --> 22:35.863
Help!

22:36.947 --> 22:37.948
Oh my God.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.325
[Woman] I didn't mean to.

22:41.327 --> 22:42.242
What?

22:42.244 --> 22:43.160
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.162
You knew I'd relapse.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.288
No, I'll go get help.

22:46.290 --> 22:47.375
It's too late.

22:49.918 --> 22:51.669
You let this happen.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.007
You survived this
before, you'll do it again.

22:55.841 --> 22:57.968
Tell Lex I still love him.

22:59.803 --> 23:00.678
What did you just say?

23:00.680 --> 23:01.511
[dramatic music]

23:37.675 --> 23:39.258
Shit.

23:39.260 --> 23:42.055
[pistol booming]

24:03.158 --> 24:03.992
Oh my God.

24:05.036 --> 24:06.576
Lex, Lex!

24:06.578 --> 24:07.871
Lex, over here!

24:08.748 --> 24:10.955
Anna, I'm sorry.

24:10.957 --> 24:11.874
I just had to...

24:11.876 --> 24:13.667
[Anna] Lex, get
me out of here.

24:13.669 --> 24:14.501
What?

24:14.503 --> 24:16.505
I'm stuck, get me out!

24:18.007 --> 24:19.384
What do you want me to do?

24:20.385 --> 24:21.594
Smash the window.

24:35.607 --> 24:36.816
Actually.

24:36.818 --> 24:37.985
Lex, please.

24:39.611 --> 24:40.611
[Lex] Why?

24:40.613 --> 24:42.195
Why?

24:42.197 --> 24:43.655
You never helped me.

24:43.657 --> 24:44.949
What are you talking about?

24:44.951 --> 24:46.784
You hung me out to dry.

24:46.786 --> 24:47.993
What?

24:47.995 --> 24:50.621
Lex, now's not the time
to talk about this.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.789
I just got back
from rehab, Anna,

24:52.791 --> 24:54.959
and they said you went
through with our divorce.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.044
You left me behind,
you saved yourself,

24:57.046 --> 24:58.336
you destroyed our family.

24:58.338 --> 25:00.131
I did it for Claire!

25:00.133 --> 25:01.673
You robbed her of her father!

25:01.675 --> 25:03.134
It was for her safety!

25:03.136 --> 25:04.719
Don't give me that bullshit.

25:04.721 --> 25:06.472
Like you weren't
popping pills too.

25:09.517 --> 25:10.351
Please.

25:13.021 --> 25:15.857
I can't wait
until you relapse.

25:19.902 --> 25:21.654
Lex, Lex, Lex, Lex!

25:25.032 --> 25:27.827
[gunshot]

25:36.376 --> 25:38.838
[whispering]

25:53.101 --> 25:56.021
[doorbell ringing]

26:06.323 --> 26:09.242
[doorbell ringing]

26:15.500 --> 26:16.541
Mrs. Winter?

26:17.835 --> 26:18.875
I'm here to fix the pipe.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.086
Don't close the door!

26:20.088 --> 26:20.920
[shrieking]

26:20.922 --> 26:23.213
[grunting]

26:23.215 --> 26:24.050
Shit.

26:25.134 --> 26:26.049
[grunting]

26:26.051 --> 26:27.843
Wedge my toolbox in the door!

26:27.845 --> 26:28.805
It'll give me room!

26:31.683 --> 26:33.015
Ow, ow, no, pull me in.

26:33.017 --> 26:34.266
No, you don't want that.

26:34.268 --> 26:35.601
I know what I'm
doing, pull me in.

26:35.603 --> 26:36.852
No, I'm stuck in here!

26:36.854 --> 26:38.398
I know, it's the nun!

26:41.442 --> 26:42.857
God, are you okay?

26:42.859 --> 26:44.234
I'm fine, I'm fine, you?

26:44.236 --> 26:45.529
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:47.072 --> 26:48.405
How long have you
been stuck here?

26:48.407 --> 26:50.074
About an hour.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.659
I'm assuming you've
met Sister Catherine?

26:51.661 --> 26:53.576
Yeah, she's a real
bitch for a woman of God.

26:53.578 --> 26:55.413
No, she's great!

26:55.415 --> 26:57.414
[thumping]

26:57.416 --> 26:58.415
Busted pipe?

26:58.417 --> 26:59.959
Apparently.

26:59.961 --> 27:00.835
I wish it were that easy.

27:00.837 --> 27:02.377
What is going on here?

27:02.379 --> 27:04.713
Yeah, well it's the nun,
she's trying to kill you.

27:04.715 --> 27:05.881
Yeah, no shit.

27:05.883 --> 27:07.758
Yeah, well her name's
Sister Catherine.

27:07.760 --> 27:12.765
[dramatic music]
[grunting]

27:13.724 --> 27:15.266
[Sister Catherine] Get out!

27:15.268 --> 27:16.433
[shrieking]

27:16.435 --> 27:19.187
[dramatic music]

27:26.738 --> 27:27.572
Shit.

27:28.947 --> 27:29.781
Go on!

27:31.951 --> 27:32.785
Come on.

27:44.629 --> 27:45.962
That won't help.

27:45.964 --> 27:47.298
It's all we've got.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.551
Well you've got your
strength and you're wasting it.

28:11.406 --> 28:12.241
K.K.

28:13.659 --> 28:14.493
Anna.

28:15.662 --> 28:17.869
I'm guessing you're
not really a mechanic?

28:17.871 --> 28:19.454
No, actually I am.

28:19.456 --> 28:21.374
I do all of Donna's houses.

28:21.376 --> 28:23.959
It's actually how I
met Sister Catherine.

28:23.961 --> 28:26.961
She's tried to kill me
every time I come here.

28:26.963 --> 28:28.424
But you keep coming back?

28:29.341 --> 28:31.092
Well, no one believes me,

28:31.094 --> 28:34.720
so might as well try
to prove her existence.

28:34.722 --> 28:35.556
Any luck?

28:36.890 --> 28:37.724
Not yet.

28:38.684 --> 28:39.977
But today looks promising.

28:41.396 --> 28:43.354
I just wanna get out of here.

28:43.356 --> 28:44.188
Hey, don't worry.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.191
That's the easy part.

28:47.443 --> 28:49.362
Her name is Sister
Margaret Catherine.

28:52.406 --> 28:54.533
She's a ghost now, obviously.

28:55.702 --> 28:58.618
Well, she thinks
she's in purgatory,

28:58.620 --> 29:02.163
and over 100 years ago this
place used to be a convent.

29:02.165 --> 29:03.624
You know, a holy land.

29:03.626 --> 29:05.667
Well she's convinced
herself that she

29:05.669 --> 29:07.586
needs to protect this
land to prove herself

29:07.588 --> 29:09.380
to God to get into heaven.

29:09.382 --> 29:10.548
Whoop!

29:10.550 --> 29:13.174
But if she thinks
you're a threat to that,

29:13.176 --> 29:16.761
well she'll chase you
away, or kill you.

29:16.763 --> 29:18.556
I think she's
taking the kill route.

29:18.558 --> 29:19.434
Yeah, me too.

29:21.059 --> 29:23.560
It's a textbook
haunting, really.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.895
You know, a tortured
soul can't rest

29:25.897 --> 29:27.897
in peace after an
untimely death.

29:27.899 --> 29:29.359
I've seen it a million times.

29:32.488 --> 29:34.029
Wanna see how she died?

29:34.031 --> 29:34.866
Yeah.

29:37.534 --> 29:39.745
[K.K.] I threw up the
first time I saw it.

29:40.788 --> 29:41.912
Oh my God.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.080
[eerie music]

29:44.082 --> 29:47.294
[garage door rumbling]

30:06.606 --> 30:07.771
Wait, no.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.981
Throw something first.

30:09.983 --> 30:10.859
Uh.

30:14.405 --> 30:15.781
Something small.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.876
[hammer thumping]

30:32.632 --> 30:35.385
[dramatic music]

30:41.640 --> 30:43.766
Should have seen that coming.

30:43.768 --> 30:46.644
God, I have hallucinating
like this since she showed up.

30:46.646 --> 30:48.104
That's just her physical form.

30:48.106 --> 30:50.897
It's how she moves around,
it's how she gives you visions,

30:50.899 --> 30:52.859
it's how she messes
with the damn pipes.

30:54.404 --> 30:55.819
Have you ever seen
the movie Ghost?

30:55.821 --> 30:56.778
Oh my God, that's
like my favorite movie!

30:56.780 --> 30:58.029
Great.

30:58.031 --> 30:59.490
So you know how it
takes Patrick Swayze

30:59.492 --> 31:01.282
a ton of energy to move
around in the physical world?

31:01.284 --> 31:02.159
Well yeah, okay, it's like...

31:02.161 --> 31:03.451
Exactly.

31:03.453 --> 31:04.787
So what we need to
do is wear her out

31:04.789 --> 31:07.123
so she won't be able to
use that physical form,

31:07.125 --> 31:09.126
and then we can get
the hell outta here.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.006
Follow me.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.554
Okay, it is June 17th.

31:21.556 --> 31:23.263
I'm here with Anna
Winter attempting

31:23.265 --> 31:24.766
to speak to Sister Catherine.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.354
Okay, that's an EMF reader.

31:30.356 --> 31:32.856
The higher it gets,
the closer she is.

31:32.858 --> 31:34.692
And if it passes
five milliguass,

31:34.694 --> 31:36.945
it'll beep and we're fucked.

31:43.036 --> 31:43.995
You're kidding.

31:46.204 --> 31:47.038
What?

31:47.040 --> 31:48.873
That's a toy!

31:48.875 --> 31:49.834
Well so is Chucky.

31:50.710 --> 31:51.916
It doesn't matter.

31:51.918 --> 31:53.294
Well does it work?

31:53.296 --> 31:54.963
No, I put it out
for decoration.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.217
Yes, it works.

32:02.722 --> 32:05.058
Okay, so if anything
happens, use this.

32:06.684 --> 32:07.682
It's a pentagram.

32:07.684 --> 32:09.769
Sometimes it scares her away.

32:09.771 --> 32:11.938
Most times it'll
just piss her off.

32:24.117 --> 32:29.123
Sister Catherine, Anna and
I are here to apologize.

32:32.918 --> 32:37.421
I am not a threat
and I wanna leave.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.838
[dramatic music]
[sensor beeping]

32:38.840 --> 32:40.258
Nope, nope, screw that.

32:41.299 --> 32:41.384
No, no, no, no, no,
please stay, please stay.

32:41.386 --> 32:43.094
That's normal, that's normal.

32:43.096 --> 32:44.888
She's a little stubborn.

32:49.644 --> 32:50.478
Stay.

32:55.441 --> 32:56.275
Protect?

32:58.235 --> 33:02.779
[Sister Catherine] Stay.

33:02.781 --> 33:03.864
What?

33:03.866 --> 33:05.782
[Sister Catherine] Stay.

33:05.784 --> 33:06.952
[Anna] What?

33:08.078 --> 33:10.248
[Sister Catherine] Stay.

33:19.924 --> 33:21.466
Stay with me, Anna.

33:24.095 --> 33:24.926
[sensor beeping]

33:24.928 --> 33:26.513
It's my time to go.

33:28.598 --> 33:31.519
You must take my place.

33:32.811 --> 33:35.604
Sister, you don't want me.

33:35.606 --> 33:37.147
I'm...

33:37.149 --> 33:39.109
[Sister Catherine] Your
life is not worth living.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.154
You're strong.

33:42.363 --> 33:45.990
Replace me as I
ascend into heaven.

33:45.992 --> 33:47.159
No, I won't!

33:48.368 --> 33:51.539
[Sister Catherine]
Then I'll force you!

33:54.500 --> 33:55.417
Pick it up!

33:56.961 --> 33:58.338
What'd she say?

34:09.806 --> 34:12.060
[thumping]

34:19.859 --> 34:20.982
What'd you see?

34:20.984 --> 34:21.815
[dramatic music]

34:50.347 --> 34:51.514
[K.K.] Anna!

34:52.475 --> 34:53.309
K.K.?

34:54.518 --> 34:55.895
K.K., I'm coming!

35:01.109 --> 35:02.316
K.K.?

35:02.318 --> 35:03.151
I'm in here.

35:08.908 --> 35:10.950
[Mike] I should
have done something.

35:10.952 --> 35:12.412
[Lex] It was her own fault.

35:13.662 --> 35:15.914
[Mike] She was always
so scared of relapse.

35:17.290 --> 35:18.834
[Lex] There was nothing
you could have done.

35:20.002 --> 35:21.419
[Mike] What about Claire?

35:21.421 --> 35:23.962
[Lex] What about her?

35:23.964 --> 35:26.756
[Mike] She's your daughter.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.341
[Lex] It doesn't feel like it.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.095
I haven't seen her
since the split.

35:31.555 --> 35:33.930
Anna kept her away from you
with that restraining order.

35:33.932 --> 35:36.935
I know, and I
resent her for that.

35:37.937 --> 35:39.145
[Mike] I don't blame you.

35:39.147 --> 35:40.898
He was dangerous.

35:42.399 --> 35:43.608
And so were you.

35:46.611 --> 35:48.446
I didn't do anything to you.

35:48.448 --> 35:50.116
Then why are you so guilty?

35:51.158 --> 35:52.660
She never could get past it.

35:55.287 --> 35:56.539
Do you still love me?

35:58.457 --> 36:00.082
[Mike] Do you still love him?

36:00.084 --> 36:01.792
Mike, I...

36:01.794 --> 36:03.877
After everything
he did to you?

36:03.879 --> 36:05.962
Mike, please!

36:05.964 --> 36:07.048
Come here.

36:07.050 --> 36:08.301
[Lex] Get away from me.

36:10.303 --> 36:12.013
Stay with me, Anna.

36:17.977 --> 36:20.480
[eerie music]

36:27.778 --> 36:29.153
Why?

36:29.155 --> 36:32.325
Tell my mom I miss
her and I love her.

36:34.827 --> 36:39.832
Tell her my noose, and
I'm skipping 5th grade.

36:42.042 --> 36:44.334
Ask her what she did.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.713
It's an accident.

36:47.673 --> 36:48.506
Mom?

36:48.508 --> 36:49.341
Oh baby!

36:53.638 --> 36:55.640
What are you doing here?

36:57.225 --> 36:58.559
We moved back.

37:00.687 --> 37:02.727
Are you a ghost?

37:02.729 --> 37:03.687
What?

37:03.689 --> 37:05.397
No, no, of course not, no.

37:05.399 --> 37:08.859
Why would you ask
me that, honey?

37:08.861 --> 37:11.614
You never came
to the new home.

37:13.783 --> 37:15.866
They found you in the hallway.

37:15.868 --> 37:16.703
Help.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.455
Somebody please, help.

37:22.542 --> 37:24.082
Am I dead?

37:24.084 --> 37:25.250
Yes.

37:25.252 --> 37:27.712
But Dad said ghosts aren't real.

37:27.714 --> 37:29.714
He's wrong, honey.

37:29.716 --> 37:30.883
He's so wrong.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.392
[eerie music]

37:49.609 --> 37:51.445
She wants you to go.

37:54.573 --> 37:57.408
She's here to take
you to heaven.

37:57.410 --> 37:58.993
Who?

37:58.995 --> 38:01.287
Your guardian angel.

38:01.289 --> 38:02.622
Sister Catherine.

38:04.374 --> 38:06.209
She says you won't go.

38:13.426 --> 38:15.261
Are you with me. Mama?

38:16.928 --> 38:18.763
I'm not going anywhere, Baby.

38:18.765 --> 38:20.263
I'll be right here.

38:20.265 --> 38:21.098
I'll stay.

[K.K.] Anna!

K.K., where are you?

39:07.814 --> 39:09.270
[K.K.] In the attic!

I'm coming!

'Sup?

39:26.832 --> 39:28.499
How did you get up here?

39:28.501 --> 39:30.167
I don't know, I
just woke up here

39:30.169 --> 39:32.294
after you used the pentagram.

39:32.296 --> 39:33.504
My bad.

39:33.506 --> 39:35.633
It's part of, it's
part of the job.

39:37.176 --> 39:38.508
Are you okay?

39:38.510 --> 39:39.884
Oh, I'll be fine.

39:39.886 --> 39:42.557
She just, she chewed
up my leg a little bit.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.848
[Anna] What happened?

39:44.850 --> 39:46.392
I have no idea.

39:46.394 --> 39:48.977
I had another one of those
silly hallucinations.

39:48.979 --> 39:50.937
I think I saw my mom.

39:50.939 --> 39:52.649

are too real.

40:11.669 --> 40:12.670
[K.K.] No.

yourself killed.

Or do that, okay.

Just hold that there.

Keep pressure on it, okay?

41:17.859 --> 41:19.986
Just keep pressure on it.

I'm not gonna make it.

gonna make it through this.

Hey, hey, our only chance is
if she actually opens the door.

Okay?

What happens if she doesn't?

No, it's just sore.

Still don't remember anything?

I guess picking up
the moving truck.

45:34.200 --> 45:36.700
Wow.

45:36.702 --> 45:37.660
Honestly, though,
I don't think

45:37.662 --> 45:39.620
I wanna remember being stabbed.

45:39.622 --> 45:41.330
[laughing]

45:41.332 --> 45:42.500
That's fair.

45:43.667 --> 45:46.669
You know that other guy, K.K.,

45:46.671 --> 45:48.879
he doesn't remember
anything either.

45:48.881 --> 45:51.048
I still think he
could be a suspect.

45:51.050 --> 45:55.305
Yeah well, we'll let the
police worry about that.

46:08.734 --> 46:10.317
Doctor Palmer gave you these?

46:10.319 --> 46:11.401
[Anna] Yeah.

46:11.403 --> 46:12.236
But they're...

46:12.238 --> 46:13.071
I know.

46:14.406 --> 46:16.365
Does he think that's safe?

46:16.367 --> 46:18.995
Well, all the other
medicines made me sick.

46:20.120 --> 46:21.370
But I think I'll be fine

46:21.372 --> 46:22.955
as long as we keep an eye on it.

46:22.957 --> 46:24.415
As long as you feel safe.

46:24.417 --> 46:25.251
I do.

46:27.002 --> 46:28.046
I can handle it, now.

46:29.546 --> 46:31.714
This has really changed you.

46:31.716 --> 46:34.049
Yeah, most near-death
experiences do.

46:34.051 --> 46:34.885
True.

46:37.847 --> 46:40.640
It's not a bad change, is it?

46:40.642 --> 46:42.268
No, not at all.

46:43.102 --> 46:46.606
You just feel peaceful.

46:48.774 --> 46:50.108
Well that's a good word.

46:51.193 --> 46:52.027
Peaceful.

47:04.707 --> 47:06.082
I don't even know how to shop.

47:06.084 --> 47:08.667
[laughing]

47:08.669 --> 47:11.088
I wear like the same
10 black t-shirts.

47:12.256 --> 47:13.546
That makes it easy.

47:13.548 --> 47:16.341
You just pick anything, though.

47:16.343 --> 47:18.762
[soft music]

47:24.185 --> 47:25.311
That's different.

47:33.443 --> 47:35.986
Wow.

47:35.988 --> 47:37.363
Good wow or bad wow?

47:37.365 --> 47:38.948
Good wow.

47:38.950 --> 47:40.281
You look amazing.

47:40.283 --> 47:41.491
Thanks!

47:41.493 --> 47:44.328
Honestly, I am surprised
at how much I like it.

47:44.330 --> 47:45.830
I think this is the first time

47:45.832 --> 47:48.915
I've seen you wearing not black.

47:48.917 --> 47:51.169
[giggling]

47:59.345 --> 48:03.180
I hope you're not doing this
because you think I like it.

48:03.182 --> 48:04.017
No, I want to.

48:05.350 --> 48:06.685
I'm shocked, frankly.

48:08.521 --> 48:09.770
I wanna move on.

48:09.772 --> 48:11.357
I wanna leave the old me behind.

48:12.899 --> 48:14.566
I'm proud of you.

48:14.568 --> 48:15.817
Thanks.

48:15.819 --> 48:17.861
I'm not ditching the
attitude, though.

48:17.863 --> 48:19.321
I wouldn't want you to.

48:19.323 --> 48:20.363
[laughing]

48:20.365 --> 48:23.035
[phone beeping]

48:24.537 --> 48:25.910
One sec.

48:25.912 --> 48:26.747
Yeah.

48:34.213 --> 48:36.004
Hey, Anna, it's Lex.

48:36.006 --> 48:37.548
Call me.

48:37.550 --> 48:39.716
I heard you and Mike finally
moved out of his aunt's house.

48:39.718 --> 48:42.179
I was thinking about
stopping by later.

48:43.347 --> 48:45.390
I'm getting cleaned
up, you know, and uh.

48:51.647 --> 48:53.855
Hey Mike, we should get
one of these for Claire.

48:53.857 --> 48:54.982
[Mike] What is it?

48:54.984 --> 48:57.236
[giggling]

49:04.493 --> 49:07.328
[laughing]

49:07.330 --> 49:08.537
Well look at you!

49:08.539 --> 49:10.205
You're not all
brains, after all!

49:10.207 --> 49:11.165
Nope.

49:11.167 --> 49:12.082
You still thinking about going

49:12.084 --> 49:13.750
out for basketball next year?

49:13.752 --> 49:14.794
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

49:14.796 --> 49:16.044
Gosh, I still can't believe

49:16.046 --> 49:17.754
that they let you
skip 5th grade.

49:17.756 --> 49:19.714
I'm excited for middle school

49:19.716 --> 49:21.383
Nobody should be
excited for middle school.

49:21.385 --> 49:22.884
- Hey!
- Dad!

49:22.886 --> 49:25.220
[Mike] It's true!

49:25.222 --> 49:26.471
Ooh, pizza!

49:26.473 --> 49:27.307
I'll get it.

49:31.854 --> 49:33.604
Hey, 21.09.

49:33.606 --> 49:34.899
Here you are.

49:36.651 --> 49:37.482
Here you go.

49:37.484 --> 49:38.316
Thanks.

49:38.318 --> 49:39.152
Yeah, have a good night.

49:43.115 --> 49:43.949
Hey wait!

49:45.618 --> 49:48.621
21.09, you gave me 21.06.

49:50.414 --> 49:51.999
It's three cents.

49:55.836 --> 49:57.546
I don't have three cents.

50:02.593 --> 50:04.846
I'm sorry, that's all I got.

50:13.729 --> 50:14.562
I'm so excited.

50:14.564 --> 50:15.812
Yes!

50:15.814 --> 50:16.939
Thank you.

50:16.941 --> 50:19.024
Can I have the first slice?

50:19.026 --> 50:19.984
Only if you hold it.

50:19.986 --> 50:20.901
'Kay.

50:20.903 --> 50:21.863
I'm gonna go get plates.

50:24.156 --> 50:24.990
What?

50:26.075 --> 50:26.908
Deja vu.

50:28.368 --> 50:30.076
We had pizza in
the moving truck.

50:30.078 --> 50:31.414
That's probably what it is.

50:32.874 --> 50:33.707
Yeah.

50:43.551 --> 50:46.136
[uneasy music]

50:59.399 --> 51:00.441
Hey Mike?

51:00.443 --> 51:01.691
[Mike] What?

51:01.693 --> 51:04.655
Did I take my pills
earlier in the car?

51:05.573 --> 51:06.613
[Mike] I don't think so.

51:06.615 --> 51:07.906
You sure?

51:07.908 --> 51:08.867
Positive.

51:13.372 --> 51:16.083
[pills rattling]

51:23.883 --> 51:26.551
Who was that that
called earlier?

51:28.053 --> 51:30.973
Mmm, it was, uh, the doctor.

51:32.182 --> 51:33.432
Everything okay?

51:33.434 --> 51:35.519
Yeah, yeah, no, he was
just checking up on me.

51:38.064 --> 51:38.897
Good.

51:55.580 --> 51:56.413
[pills rattling]

51:56.415 --> 51:57.622
You forgot this.

51:57.624 --> 51:58.582
No, I didn't.

51:58.584 --> 52:00.042
I took one in the bathroom.

52:00.044 --> 52:01.127
When I was in there?

52:01.129 --> 52:02.086
Yeah, I asked you.

52:02.088 --> 52:03.879
No you didn't.

52:03.881 --> 52:05.423
I swear I did, and if not,

52:05.425 --> 52:07.966
then I definitely
took one in the car.

52:07.968 --> 52:09.177
Take it just in case.

52:10.345 --> 52:11.511
I'll take it first
thing in the morning.

52:11.513 --> 52:13.098
I think you
should take it now.

52:16.644 --> 52:18.271
I'm going to bed.

52:21.774 --> 52:23.357
[fist thumping]
[ominous music]

52:23.359 --> 52:26.696
Anna, take it.

52:29.615 --> 52:33.118
Michael, you never
talk to me like this.

52:34.495 --> 52:35.747
Take it, now.

52:49.885 --> 52:52.137
[coughing]

52:58.310 --> 53:00.312
Hey, baby, are you okay?

53:03.066 --> 53:05.191
I took too many
of those pills.

53:05.193 --> 53:06.651
[Mike] I screwed up.

53:06.653 --> 53:07.611
Can you forgive me.

53:08.821 --> 53:11.154
Can we talk about
this in the morning?

53:11.156 --> 53:12.325
[Mike] Sure.

53:13.450 --> 53:15.369
Here, this will help
you feel better.

53:16.537 --> 53:18.037
[Anna] What is it?

53:18.039 --> 53:19.707
[Mike] From when I
had my stomach flu.

53:22.459 --> 53:23.627
Mike, that's mine.

53:24.836 --> 53:26.087
I don't know what you're...

53:26.089 --> 53:27.296
[Mike] What are
you talking about?

53:27.298 --> 53:28.883
Get that away from me!

53:33.388 --> 53:34.970
[Mike] I wouldn't
do that to you.

53:34.972 --> 53:36.430
I'm not taking it!

53:36.432 --> 53:37.515
[Mike] But...

53:37.517 --> 53:38.685
I said no!

53:40.687 --> 53:41.854
[Mike] Fine.

54:07.839 --> 54:10.341
[eerie music]

54:13.135 --> 54:15.887
[faint speaking]

54:20.267 --> 54:23.186
[doorbell ringing]

54:37.577 --> 54:38.410
Lex.

54:39.703 --> 54:42.457
Um, I was just about to leave.

54:44.542 --> 54:46.294
I thought that
maybe we could talk.

54:48.254 --> 54:49.964
I don't think
that's a good idea.

54:51.381 --> 54:54.049
Anna, I just wanna talk
to you one more time.

54:54.051 --> 54:55.928
I really gotta go, I'm sorry.

54:59.140 --> 55:00.013
Don't wreck this.

55:00.015 --> 55:00.849
Lex, please.

55:02.060 --> 55:06.814
Anna, I need to
tell ya something.

55:07.939 --> 55:10.691
You're breaking the
restraining order.

55:10.693 --> 55:11.611
I still love you.

55:12.528 --> 55:13.736
I'm calling the cops.

55:13.738 --> 55:15.111
And I know that you
still love me too!

55:15.113 --> 55:15.988
I mean it!

55:15.990 --> 55:17.367
Stay with me, Anna.

55:18.785 --> 55:21.788
[suspenseful music]

55:29.671 --> 55:30.504
I'll shoot.

55:33.800 --> 55:35.885
You're worth dyin' for.

55:43.267 --> 55:45.308
Go on, hmm?

55:45.310 --> 55:46.144
Do it.

55:47.021 --> 55:48.604
Hmm?

55:48.606 --> 55:49.691
Go on, do it.

55:51.316 --> 55:52.150
Do it!

55:54.236 --> 55:55.736
Ah!

55:55.738 --> 55:57.323
Jesus Christ,
all right, all right!

56:12.296 --> 56:13.131
Nothing?

56:15.008 --> 56:16.256
Nothing.

56:16.258 --> 56:17.718
No flashes or anything?

56:20.513 --> 56:23.348
The only thing I remember
is the name Sister Catherine.

56:27.394 --> 56:30.897
Okay, well, does
this ring a bell?

56:32.566 --> 56:34.024
That's mine.

56:34.026 --> 56:37.236
Yeah, and I remember
you telling me to use that

56:37.238 --> 56:40.531
in case of an emergency and
putting it in my pocket.

56:40.533 --> 56:42.741
I bought this on a
ghost hunting project.

56:42.743 --> 56:43.577
Ghost hunting?

56:45.037 --> 56:48.163
Um, it's a hobby of mine.

56:48.165 --> 56:50.457
Okay, well we must have been

56:50.459 --> 56:52.625
messing with it in
that rental house.

56:52.627 --> 56:53.877
Doubt it.

56:53.879 --> 56:55.379
I mean, I fixed some
pipes there once,

56:55.381 --> 56:56.796
and I thought there might be
something paranormal going on,

56:56.798 --> 56:58.716
but that was really it.

56:58.718 --> 57:00.759
Okay, then how did
I end up with this?

57:00.761 --> 57:01.595
Does it matter?

57:04.140 --> 57:06.723
Look, strange stuff has been
happening at my house, okay?

57:06.725 --> 57:07.975
And I think that
it has something

57:07.977 --> 57:09.894
to do with what
happened that day.

57:09.896 --> 57:11.770
No, you're crazy.

57:11.772 --> 57:12.729
[Anna] K.K., please.

57:12.731 --> 57:14.147
No, no.

57:14.149 --> 57:15.607
Anna, I really don't
have time for this, okay?

57:15.609 --> 57:17.984
Okay, we need to find
out what happened that day.

57:17.986 --> 57:19.321
It's over, Anna.

57:21.658 --> 57:22.617
You gotta move on.

57:42.428 --> 57:45.095
What the hell is this?

57:45.097 --> 57:46.680
My medication?

57:46.682 --> 57:48.559
Yeah, why are they all gone?

57:50.519 --> 57:51.935
I haven't touched them.

57:51.937 --> 57:52.939
Don't bullshit me.

57:53.856 --> 57:55.064
You're hooked.

57:55.066 --> 57:56.272
Mike, I swear to God,

57:56.274 --> 57:58.274
I haven't taken one
since I got sick!

57:58.276 --> 57:59.567
How could you do this?

57:59.569 --> 58:00.903
Do you want a repeat of
what happened with Lex?

58:00.905 --> 58:02.488
I didn't take them!

58:02.490 --> 58:03.363
You're lying.

58:03.365 --> 58:04.198
Where are you going?

58:04.200 --> 58:05.201
Oh my God!

58:09.372 --> 58:10.705
Everything okay?

58:10.707 --> 58:12.330
Get away from me!

58:12.332 --> 58:15.002
[ominous music]

58:23.218 --> 58:24.426
Hey baby, come with
mom.

58:24.428 --> 58:25.343
Mom?

58:25.345 --> 58:28.096
Come, come, come, okay.

58:28.098 --> 58:28.930
Mom!

58:28.932 --> 58:31.142
No, no, no, no.

58:31.144 --> 58:33.727
[screaming]

58:33.729 --> 58:34.563
Go!

58:40.903 --> 58:41.736
You okay?

58:41.738 --> 58:43.071
[Claire] Yeah.

58:44.656 --> 58:45.613
[knocking on door]

58:45.615 --> 58:46.448
[Mike] Anna, let me in.

58:46.450 --> 58:47.700
Go away!

58:47.702 --> 58:49.701
[Mike] I'm serious,
something's going on.

58:49.703 --> 58:51.162
I can't trust you!

58:51.164 --> 58:52.622
[Mike] Lex is in the house.

58:53.665 --> 58:54.622
Daddy!

58:54.624 --> 58:56.834
[Lex] Don't you call him that!

58:56.836 --> 58:57.919
Give me my daughter!

59:03.258 --> 59:06.595
[Sister Catherine]
Stay with me, Anna.

59:08.765 --> 59:10.138
Sister Catherine?

59:10.140 --> 59:13.142
Leave this life behind.

59:13.144 --> 59:14.517
What did you do to Mike?

59:14.519 --> 59:16.354
[Sister Catherine]
Mike's gone.

59:16.356 --> 59:19.107
Next I take you
or your daughter.

59:21.568 --> 59:25.529
You don't want this
life, this struggle.

59:25.531 --> 59:28.616
The past will never leave you.

59:28.618 --> 59:33.623
The addiction, the
abuse, it all comes back.

59:34.790 --> 59:36.209
You've seen it first hand.

59:37.834 --> 59:39.711
It's you or the girl.

59:44.341 --> 59:47.095
[dramatic music]

59:48.220 --> 59:50.639
[whispering]

59:53.017 --> 59:55.269
[coughing]

59:57.479 --> 59:59.231
No, no, no, don't
die, don't die.

01:00:04.903 --> 01:00:06.194
K.K.?

01:00:06.196 --> 01:00:10.281
Yeah, yeah it's
me, there you go.

01:00:10.283 --> 01:00:11.241
[Anna] Where am I?

01:00:11.243 --> 01:00:12.701
You're in the bathroom.

01:00:12.703 --> 01:00:14.578
You got hurt in the attic.

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:15.456
I was stabbed.

01:00:16.749 --> 01:00:17.582
Yeah.

01:00:19.961 --> 01:00:22.461
Okay, in the rental house.

01:00:22.463 --> 01:00:23.839
This is the rental house.

01:00:26.591 --> 01:00:28.010
No, no, no, no.

01:00:29.761 --> 01:00:31.386
No, I was out.

01:00:31.388 --> 01:00:32.305
What are you talking about?

01:00:32.307 --> 01:00:33.138
What do you mean?

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.974
No, no.

01:00:34.892 --> 01:00:36.933
No, I was out!

01:00:36.935 --> 01:00:37.769
Shit, no!

01:00:38.771 --> 01:00:40.270
[screaming]

01:00:40.272 --> 01:00:41.104
You're gonna make it worse.

01:00:41.106 --> 01:00:42.939
[screaming]

01:00:42.941 --> 01:00:43.774
You're just gonna make it worse.

01:00:43.776 --> 01:00:45.026
Come on.

01:00:45.028 --> 01:00:46.401
I was out.

01:00:46.403 --> 01:00:48.447
[crying]

01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:53.702
[groaning]

01:00:55.537 --> 01:00:58.788
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:00:58.790 --> 01:00:59.834
I was out, K.K.

01:01:02.336 --> 01:01:05.130
Oh God, it had
been three months.

01:01:07.466 --> 01:01:12.472
And I was in the new house,
and I saw her, her face,

01:01:15.807 --> 01:01:17.351
and she looked.

01:01:18.769 --> 01:01:21.521
She's losing, she's
losing her physical form.

01:01:22.981 --> 01:01:24.899
Oh my God, I've read about this.

01:01:24.901 --> 01:01:27.484
I never thought I'd
actually see it though.

01:01:27.486 --> 01:01:29.071
She listens to us.

01:01:31.031 --> 01:01:33.200
Maybe that's where
she gets the visions.

01:01:34.618 --> 01:01:36.328
I think I know what to do.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.165
Follow my lead, okay?

01:01:43.836 --> 01:01:45.171
We need to get out of here!

01:01:49.841 --> 01:01:51.426
No, there's no way!

01:01:52.511 --> 01:01:54.180
We'll go through the attic.

01:01:55.305 --> 01:01:58.182
The fan in the attic.

01:01:58.184 --> 01:02:00.850
We could pop it out
and get out from there.

01:02:00.852 --> 01:02:02.187
Yes, exactly!

01:02:04.691 --> 01:02:05.524
Okay.

01:02:07.276 --> 01:02:08.111
Help me up.

01:02:19.162 --> 01:02:19.997
Okay.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.497
What?

01:02:22.499 --> 01:02:23.333
Go up there.

01:02:25.211 --> 01:02:27.877
There's not actually
an exit up there.

01:02:27.879 --> 01:02:30.214
Look, lure her up there

01:02:30.216 --> 01:02:32.260
and then meet me in
the kitchen, okay?

01:02:33.218 --> 01:02:34.386
Oh, so I'm bait, now?

01:02:36.472 --> 01:02:37.598
Trust me, okay?

01:02:39.892 --> 01:02:40.727
Yeah, but...

01:02:41.852 --> 01:02:42.685
K.K.

01:02:42.687 --> 01:02:43.771
Fine, fine.

01:02:50.903 --> 01:02:53.363
[eerie music]

01:03:02.622 --> 01:03:05.417
[sensor beeping]

01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:10.671
It is June 17th.

01:03:10.673 --> 01:03:12.298
I'm here with Anna Winter

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:14.510
attempting to speak
to Sister Catherine.

01:03:17.763 --> 01:03:20.182
[whispering]

01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:27.482
Sister Catherine, we surrender.

01:03:39.493 --> 01:03:43.914
Anna has agreed to stay so
as long as you spare my life.

01:03:44.915 --> 01:03:46.167
Isn't that right, Anna.

01:03:47.627 --> 01:03:48.461
Yeah.

01:04:28.251 --> 01:04:35.173
Kenneth, I know you're
in here, I heard you.

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:48.852
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

01:04:48.854 --> 01:04:50.270
Do your job!

01:04:50.272 --> 01:04:51.187
Nice to see you.

01:04:51.189 --> 01:04:53.607
You disobeyed me.

01:04:53.609 --> 01:04:54.610
Do your job!

01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:57.611
Keep your promise!

01:04:57.613 --> 01:04:58.448
I can't.

01:04:59.406 --> 01:05:00.325
Okay, okay.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.015
Oh, thank God.

01:05:25.098 --> 01:05:27.225
Okay, okay follow me.

01:05:31.689 --> 01:05:32.899
Come on, K.K., let's go.

01:05:37.403 --> 01:05:38.279
I'm sorry, Anna.

01:05:39.488 --> 01:05:40.490
Don't be, come on.

01:05:43.825 --> 01:05:45.033
K.K., move!

01:05:45.035 --> 01:05:47.789
[dramatic music]

01:05:49.749 --> 01:05:51.457
I don't really wanna
do this, I'm sorry,

01:05:51.459 --> 01:05:52.957
but I have no choice.

01:05:52.959 --> 01:05:56.294
[Anna] No, no!

01:05:56.296 --> 01:05:58.548
[grunting]

01:06:02.178 --> 01:06:04.180
Anna, I've been
dead for three years.

01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:10.060
She killed me in this house!

01:06:11.437 --> 01:06:13.604
And she won't let me leave
until I kill her replacement.

01:06:13.606 --> 01:06:17.109
K.K. don't do
this! [screaming]

01:06:20.613 --> 01:06:22.115
I tried to save us both.

01:06:23.281 --> 01:06:25.281
If we got rid of
her, we'd be free.

01:06:25.283 --> 01:06:27.450
No, it's not too late, K.K.

01:06:27.452 --> 01:06:29.955
You can't beat her,
she's too powerful!

01:06:31.164 --> 01:06:34.625
I thought we could,
but I was wrong.

01:06:34.627 --> 01:06:36.921
[grunting]

01:06:42.718 --> 01:06:44.970

01:07:22.341 --> 01:07:23.175

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.513
Anna!

01:07:29.473 --> 01:07:31.684
[grunting]

01:07:34.144 --> 01:07:35.187
Why'd you do it?

01:07:38.524 --> 01:07:41.776
Like you, my life
was not worth living.

01:07:41.778 --> 01:07:44.986
Father Don said that
if I killed myself

01:07:44.988 --> 01:07:48.158
I would go to hell,
and I didn't care!

01:07:51.412 --> 01:07:53.995
And then I was blessed
with a chance to return

01:07:53.997 --> 01:07:57.042
to this land and
prove myself to God.

01:07:59.586 --> 01:08:02.879
I wanna give you the
same opportunity.

01:08:02.881 --> 01:08:07.258
In the name of the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:12.224
In the name of the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Ghost!

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.059
Mike?

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.393
[Mike] Anna?

01:08:58.395 --> 01:08:59.228
Mike?

01:08:59.229 --> 01:09:00.228
[Mike] I'm here.

01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:01.064
Where?

01:09:02.316 --> 01:09:03.234
Mike, Mike.

[screaming]

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:39.518
Sorry, sorry!

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.187
Oh, should have read
the room, sorry, sorry.

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:42.020
- It's me.
- K.K.

01:09:42.022 --> 01:09:44.104
It's K.K., yeah.

01:09:44.107 --> 01:09:45.691
Yeah.

01:09:45.693 --> 01:09:47.986
Hey, I saw some spooky shit too.

01:09:49.654 --> 01:09:51.531
I guess I'm kinda
spooky as well.

01:09:52.698 --> 01:09:54.742
Hey, but you know
what that means?

01:09:54.744 --> 01:09:56.663
That means we're losing
our physical form.

01:09:58.288 --> 01:10:00.372
Okay?

01:10:00.374 --> 01:10:03.209
Hey, hey, hey, you wanna
know how to beat her?

01:10:03.211 --> 01:10:04.044
Yeah.

01:10:05.171 --> 01:10:08.339
[head thumping]

01:10:08.341 --> 01:10:09.842
I'm sorry, Anna.

01:10:16.223 --> 01:10:17.976
Stay with me, Anna.

01:10:20.395 --> 01:10:24.854
Stay with me and your demons
will no longer hurt you.

01:10:24.856 --> 01:10:26.398
[eerie music]

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.359

Don't do this.

01:10:49.548 --> 01:10:51.381
Don't leave me, Anna.

Hi, who are you?

01:12:42.787 --> 01:12:45.496
I'm Kenneth, a
friend of Donna's.

01:12:45.498 --> 01:12:47.497
I'm looking for my
wife, Anna Winter.

01:12:47.499 --> 01:12:49.332
I was supposed to
meet her two hours ago

01:12:49.334 --> 01:12:50.835
and I haven't seen her.

01:12:50.837 --> 01:12:52.252
Well if you wanna,
you know, come inside,

01:12:52.254 --> 01:12:54.505
we can call her or look
for her or something.

01:12:54.507 --> 01:12:55.341
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:57.885 --> 01:13:00.094

Please don't move.

01:13:10.897 --> 01:13:11.732
Mike.

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:15.360
Get away from there.

01:13:16.445 --> 01:13:17.652
Tell her to come here.

01:13:17.654 --> 01:13:19.529
No, I'll die for her.

01:13:19.531 --> 01:13:22.241
Dude, please, just please?

01:13:22.243 --> 01:13:23.867
Mike, don't go in there.

01:13:23.869 --> 01:13:25.329
Anna, get back in the truck!

01:13:27.205 --> 01:13:28.621
What?

01:13:28.623 --> 01:13:31.584
Get back in the truck, now!

It's okay.

I'm sorry, Anna.

What's gonna
happen to you, K.K.?

I mean, if I didn't
screw up too much.

01:15:14.021 --> 01:15:15.645
What about Catherine?

01:15:15.647 --> 01:15:17.982
Well, I mean, she
kinda like burst

01:15:17.984 --> 01:15:20.986
into flames, so it
usually means hell.

01:15:26.784 --> 01:15:27.702
Bye, K.K.

01:15:28.828 --> 01:15:29.662
Bye.

01:15:35.668 --> 01:15:38.376
[heavy breathing]

01:15:38.378 --> 01:15:39.336
[grunting]

01:15:39.338 --> 01:15:42.340
Just hold on, just hold on.

01:15:42.342 --> 01:15:44.008
One, two, three.

01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:46.176
[grunting]

01:15:46.178 --> 01:15:48.221
I'm gonna call 911, okay?

01:15:54.227 --> 01:15:55.644
Mike.

01:15:55.646 --> 01:15:57.479
It's gonna be okay.

01:15:57.481 --> 01:15:59.024
It's gonna be okay.

01:16:18.878 --> 01:16:21.379
[laughing]

01:16:21.381 --> 01:16:22.214
What?

01:16:23.216 --> 01:16:25.465
I'm so ready for dinner.

01:16:25.467 --> 01:16:26.384
Look at you!

01:16:26.386 --> 01:16:28.551
You're not all brains after all.

01:16:28.553 --> 01:16:30.138
Yeah, I don't know about that.

01:16:31.348 --> 01:16:32.889
Still wanna go out
for track next year?

01:16:32.891 --> 01:16:34.810
Yeah, depending on
the coach, though.

01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:38.562
Gosh, I still can't believe
they let you skip 5th grade.

01:16:38.564 --> 01:16:40.732
I don't think I'm
ready for middle school.

01:16:41.943 --> 01:16:43.943
No one is ready
for middle school.

01:16:43.945 --> 01:16:44.904
That's the truth.

01:16:47.699 --> 01:16:49.072
Ooh, pizza!

01:16:49.074 --> 01:16:49.908
I'll get it.

01:16:51.535 --> 01:16:53.245
All right,
so look at this cat.

01:16:56.289 --> 01:16:57.417
Hey, 21.09.

01:17:01.212 --> 01:17:02.044
There you go.

01:17:02.046 --> 01:17:02.877
Thanks.

01:17:02.879 --> 01:17:04.382
Have a good one.

01:17:07.885 --> 01:17:08.720
Wait.

01:17:12.222 --> 01:17:13.725
Never mind, my bad.

01:17:21.774 --> 01:17:24.276

01:18:01.897 --> 01:18:03.732
Oh my God, my floor!
