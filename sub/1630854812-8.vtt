14:07.881 --> 14:09.047
- I hear you. I hear you.
- Come on, man. Let us in.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.281
- I remember that doorbell
from last time.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.783
We're going
to the show tonight, boy.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.785
- There's hotels out here,
you know what I mean?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.220
- We goin' to the show tonight.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.855
- Now that, like,
I've had bad weeks,

14:16.923 --> 14:18.690
I've had good weeks,
I'm kind of ready

14:18.758 --> 14:20.024
for Mike and Pauly to show up.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.759
I kind of feel like
I have nothing to lose,

14:21.828 --> 14:24.262
and now is the perfect time
for them to come watch me.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.064
- It's a big night tonight.
It's week four.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.332
- Yeah.
- It's week four.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.167
- Mike went home on week four.
- I know. I know.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.501
I have to--no.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.171
When I heard Mike went home
on week four,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.373
<i> I kind of thought, like, damn,</i>

14:35.442 --> 14:37.508
I hope I get farther than Mike.
[laughs]

14:37.577 --> 14:38.977
You know, you guys are here
for a good one.

14:39.045 --> 14:39.944
It's Disney night.
- Yeah.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.179
- Ooh.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.513
- I'm doing a song from "Luca."
- Yeah.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.748
- What are you
wearing tonight, man?

14:43.817 --> 14:44.883
What's the outfit tonight?

14:44.951 --> 14:46.851
- I'm dressed as, like,
a little boy

14:46.920 --> 14:48.353
and [bleep], you know?

14:48.455 --> 14:49.587
- So you don't gotta change?

14:49.656 --> 14:53.024
[laughter]

14:53.093 --> 14:54.659
- I'm just happy
you guys are here,

14:54.728 --> 14:56.361

14:56.429 --> 14:59.030
I've been at the bottom twice,
and I don't really

14:59.099 --> 15:01.032

in the audience and stuff.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.201
- Yeah.
- I miss the East Coast though.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.736
- Yeah.
- I miss foo--I miss home.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.805
Oh, speaking of, did my mom
give you anything to give me?

15:07.874 --> 15:09.474
- Not me.
- No?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.642
- Nah.
- She didn't drop anything off?

about her old house.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.114
Which door do I go?

We're in the family room.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.232
- How are you guys?
- Welcome, welcome.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.767
- Do you have tinsel
in your hair?

17:15.835 --> 17:17.568
- I do.
- She's 12. I love it.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.370
- You wanna feel it?
- Is it actual tinsel?

17:19.439 --> 17:20.371
- That's so funny.
It's tinsel?

17:20.440 --> 17:21.639
- Yes.
- It's real tinsel.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.207

for New Orleans?

17:23.276 --> 17:25.476

we get a text from Pauly.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.644
Pauly just texted me.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.013
Next family vacation is NOLA.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.815
And I'm like, why not?

17:30.884 --> 17:31.916
- I'm gonna be out in NOLA.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.217
I got a show out here,
and I was trying

17:33.286 --> 17:34.352
to get the gang together.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.521
- Have you ever
been to New Orleans?

17:36.589 --> 17:39.157
- NOLA, NOLA.
- NOLA.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.426
- Do we need to bring beads?
- What do you need beads for?

17:41.494 --> 17:42.960
Are you not seeing
enough boobies?

17:45.965 --> 17:47.732
- Are you ready
for New Orleans?

17:47.801 --> 17:49.267
- We had such a good time
when we went there.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.135
- God, New Orleans,

17:51.204 --> 17:53.905
that's where
my bachelorette party was.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.940
- Bachelorette party!

18:04.184 --> 18:05.883
so I'm not really feeling
going there.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.952
It's bringing up
bad memories for me.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.487
- At least this trip,
we're going in--

18:09.556 --> 18:11.722
in good spirits, all of us.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.758
- Can we find spirits
down there?

18:13.827 --> 18:15.960
I wanna do something
really [bleep] scary.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.029
- Wait, I just came back
from Salem, right?

18:18.098 --> 18:20.932
When I was in Salem,
I bought mad,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.366
like, witch spell books.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.569
- Let's do it down there.
- Ooh.

- I'm not doing anything
that's gonna upset spirits.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.574
- No, I have
everything we need.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.842
- Let's do it.
- Well, I'm not doing anything.

18:30.910 --> 18:31.943
- Do you have the ingredients?

18:32.011 --> 18:33.811
- I have a [bleep]
pendulum thing.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.046
- What does it mean?

18:35.115 --> 18:36.414
We're not doing anything
like that in this house.

18:36.483 --> 18:37.482
- Don't do it.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.649
- It's not gonna
bring anything bad.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.151
It's just--
- I don't care.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.686
Listen, I don't
want people to talk

18:41.754 --> 18:43.788
about bad juju in my house.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.289
My house is good vibes only.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.291
- I've done it in my own house
a million times.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.526
- I don't care.
That's your house.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.827
We're not doing
that in my house.

18:49.896 --> 18:50.962
- But nothing bad happen--
- Don't do it here.

18:51.030 --> 18:51.996

in my house.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.464

18:53.533 --> 18:55.166
- Can we do it?
- Don't [bleep] do it

- Come on! Why?

18:56.503 --> 18:57.602
