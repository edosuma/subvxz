WEBVTT

01:40.852 --> 01:43.480
I'm gonna go make my rounds
on the other end.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.067
I'll check back with you in about 20 minutes.

01:52.071 --> 01:54.532
I didn't know Audrey's dad's a cop.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.951
I didn't mean no disrespect.

01:57.035 --> 01:59.370
Yes, sir.
We didn't mean any disrespect.

01:59.788 --> 02:01.539
Audrey's 16.

02:02.248 --> 02:05.168
We got you on statch rape.
You know that, right?

02:06.294 --> 02:08.588
You know what happens
to pretty boys like you

02:08.671 --> 02:11.883
who go up to The Farm on statch charges?

02:23.770 --> 02:24.771
Look at that.

02:26.689 --> 02:28.399
Door come open.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.361
Y'all want to step out a bit?

02:32.237 --> 02:33.738
Take some air?

02:37.075 --> 02:38.243
No, sir.

02:40.954 --> 02:43.540
I think that you're a little angry right now.

02:43.623 --> 02:45.375
You telling me how I feel?

02:48.628 --> 02:50.421
That's patronizing.

02:52.507 --> 02:53.883
Two choices.

02:54.676 --> 02:57.345
We do this here with an understanding

02:57.428 --> 03:02.141
that not you or any of your river rat boys
comes within 100 yards of my daughter.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.979
Or we file those charges.

03:07.313 --> 03:11.568
I got a lot of brothers in Angola
who love to owe me a favor.

03:20.076 --> 03:21.661
Come on out here.

03:24.831 --> 03:26.749
Come on.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.799
Come out here.

03:39.762 --> 03:42.807
A man's game charges a man's price.

03:43.725 --> 03:46.311
You take that away from this, if nothing else.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.079
Please!

04:06.497 --> 04:08.708
I'm sorry. Please!

04:45.495 --> 04:48.456
<i>Disciplinary reports say
he was acting unstable even before.</i>

04:48.539 --> 04:50.541
What happened, you and him?

04:50.625 --> 04:52.794
Two formal reprimands. Suspension.

04:53.544 --> 04:58.841
Your major back then, Salter,
wrote "manic state."

04:59.884 --> 05:00.927
Right here.

05:01.386 --> 05:05.139
No, he started pulling lost time more.

05:05.223 --> 05:06.683
But okay.

05:06.766 --> 05:08.059
And, for whatever reason,

05:09.978 --> 05:13.189
<i>he started working something
that I didn't know about.</i>

05:13.272 --> 05:15.149
<i>Old missing persons.</i>

05:16.484 --> 05:18.069
What you want, man?

05:18.361 --> 05:19.612
Nothing here for you.

05:19.946 --> 05:21.781
I'm with the State Police department.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.493
If you're Terry Guidry,
I'd like to talk to you about your boy.

05:28.204 --> 05:30.206
Sheriff call for a search party?

05:31.624 --> 05:34.085
They had a marine unit out there.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.920
Spotlight, everything.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.464
Nothing.

05:40.717 --> 05:43.845
Four weeks later,
wildlife fishers found his pirogue.

05:46.055 --> 05:47.265
All broke up.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.936
They said it could have been a gator.

05:52.812 --> 05:54.564
Where did Sonny go to school?

05:55.815 --> 05:57.150
Queen of Angels.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.986
One of them Tuttle schools.

06:04.282 --> 06:07.660
We didn't sleep
them first four weeks Sonny was missing.

06:10.121 --> 06:11.789
Drove his mama crazy.

06:13.875 --> 06:19.172
She thought she heard him, under the water.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.468
Calling for her.

06:28.139 --> 06:32.226
Hey, man, look,
why don't you just get out of here?

06:32.310 --> 06:33.394
Please.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.315
I don't want to get arrested. Just get.

06:38.983 --> 06:41.152
Before I do something to you.

06:44.113 --> 06:47.325
If it's wrong, I want it right. That's all I got.

06:47.992 --> 06:50.328
We're not going to talk to you...

06:50.411 --> 06:53.414
Personal matters like this... Without you...

06:53.498 --> 06:56.417
You don't want to talk about something,
it's okay. No problem.

06:58.878 --> 07:01.464
You sure we can't get you any coffee, or...

07:01.547 --> 07:02.965
No, thank you.

07:04.175 --> 07:05.551
You worried about your ex?

07:06.427 --> 07:08.429
It's okay. We're not looking at him.

07:08.638 --> 07:10.264
And nobody wants to.

07:10.515 --> 07:13.476
What are you looking for from me?

07:14.560 --> 07:17.271
Well, perspective, I guess.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.942
Something went down, 2002.

07:21.192 --> 07:24.237
Your ex-husband's partner, Rustin Cohle.

07:24.695 --> 07:25.738
In a former life,

07:25.822 --> 07:30.326
I used to exhaust myself navigating
crude men who thought they were clever.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.453
So ask your questions or I'm leaving.

07:32.537 --> 07:35.164
That's a cop's wife, all right.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.333
Not anymore.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.752
We're not trying
to work you, ma'am.

07:39.836 --> 07:40.962
Word of honor.

07:41.921 --> 07:44.715
We need to know about Rustin Cohle in 2002.

07:45.383 --> 07:47.593
Why he took off. What he's done since.

07:47.885 --> 07:51.472
Have you had any contact
with Cohle, Mrs. Sawyer, since 2002?

07:51.556 --> 07:52.640
No, I haven't.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.142
But you knew him well enough.

07:54.225 --> 07:56.310
I mean, he was your husband's partner.

07:56.394 --> 07:58.146
Rust, yeah, I knew him.

07:58.855 --> 08:00.481
Not as well as other people.

08:00.565 --> 08:02.942
Why exactly are you asking about him?

08:03.317 --> 08:04.819
Something bad happened.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.196
Maybe Cohle's involved.

08:08.114 --> 08:10.741
More we look at him, it don't look good.

08:10.908 --> 08:13.870
Something went real wrong with him
a long time ago.

08:15.329 --> 08:19.750
I knew Rust to be a good man.
So I can't imagine what I can offer.

08:29.468 --> 08:32.138
<i>Rust knew exactly who he was</i>

08:34.724 --> 08:37.185
<i>and there was no talking him out of it.</i>

08:42.982 --> 08:47.236
Marty's single big problem
was he never really knew himself.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.656
So he never really knew what to want.

08:53.034 --> 08:56.621
But I'm big enough
to not stay angry at someone for that.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.540
Not after all this time.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.397
Thank you so much.

09:23.481 --> 09:25.149
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.574
Can I help you with anything, sir?

09:33.658 --> 09:37.662
Oh, yeah. Please.
I was thinking about this one.

10:05.231 --> 10:06.482
Fuck!

10:21.497 --> 10:23.791
Excuse me. Can I get a dirty martini, please?

10:23.874 --> 10:25.835
- Coming right up.
- Thanks.

10:34.719 --> 10:36.178
Big weekend planned?

10:37.221 --> 10:39.598
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.810
Has all the makings of a good time.

10:46.105 --> 10:47.857
You're a cop, aren't you?

10:49.025 --> 10:50.234
How'd you know?

10:50.943 --> 10:52.278
I...

10:52.361 --> 10:55.156
I think I saw you before, years back.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.493
- You get in some trouble?
- No...

11:00.703 --> 11:04.665
You came around this place I was staying
asking about a girl.

11:07.209 --> 11:08.252
Marty.

11:09.587 --> 11:10.713
Beth.

11:26.145 --> 11:27.396
We're closed.

11:31.859 --> 11:35.112
You always hit the bottle
this early in the day, Reverend?

11:45.748 --> 11:46.832
Who are you?

11:47.583 --> 11:49.126
You don't remember me?

11:51.837 --> 11:56.008
I came to see you at your revival tent,
January '95.

11:56.175 --> 11:57.843
Looks like you gave that up.

11:58.636 --> 12:01.806
Mid-'80s,
you were still with the Tuttle ministry then.

12:01.889 --> 12:07.019
What do you know about a Tuttle organization
that was set up to finance rural schools?

12:11.107 --> 12:12.983
It was called Wellsprings.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.655
It was an evangelical initiative
to provide religious education

12:17.738 --> 12:21.325
as an alternative to public schooling
in rural communities.

12:22.326 --> 12:25.204
Part of the reason there were
so many dropouts in the state,

12:25.287 --> 12:27.665
a lot of kids had to bus an hour or more.

12:29.667 --> 12:32.795
You know about that school
on Pelican Island?

12:32.878 --> 12:34.922
I don't know it specific.

12:36.006 --> 12:39.760
But there was one in 1988.

12:42.221 --> 12:46.308
Accusations of children being interfered with.

12:49.103 --> 12:51.522
I never found anything on that.

12:51.772 --> 12:55.484
It was kept internal, I think.

12:55.568 --> 12:58.737
Maybe it was nothing.
Maybe people was paid.

12:58.821 --> 13:03.159
It's got nothing to do with me, mind you.
I was going to school in Baton Rouge.

13:03.242 --> 13:07.913
Gossip around the seminary,
but we didn't give credence to rumors.

13:10.374 --> 13:11.876
Why'd you leave?

13:13.586 --> 13:15.004
Bureaucracy.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.339
Politics.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.850
Don't lie to me.

13:30.144 --> 13:31.687
Why'd you leave?

13:38.235 --> 13:40.738
Part of our lay duties was custodial.

13:44.533 --> 13:48.704
One night,
cleaning the senior minister's library,

13:50.414 --> 13:53.584
I knocked over a very old volume.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.171
<i>The Letters of Telios DeLorca.</i>

13:57.880 --> 14:01.091
Twelfth-century Franciscan mystic.
Very obscure.

14:03.928 --> 14:07.556
When I picked up the book,
this little folder falls out.

14:10.518 --> 14:12.019
A little folder of pictures.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.566
Pictures of children.

14:20.819 --> 14:21.946
Naked.

14:25.324 --> 14:26.909
Looked like they were sleeping.

14:28.369 --> 14:29.703
And what did you do?

14:30.287 --> 14:34.542
I took it over to the Morals Officer,
Deacon Farrar.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.962
He was close with Tuttle,
vice-president of the college.

14:38.546 --> 14:41.507
- He didn't do nothing?
- No.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.635
He seemed angry that I brought it to him.

14:45.302 --> 14:48.681
He even intimated that maybe
I was confessing to something.

14:50.975 --> 14:53.936
I had to prove to him that I wasn't.

14:54.812 --> 14:56.981
He promised to look into it.

14:58.649 --> 15:01.694
I left by the time Wellsprings shut down.

15:06.574 --> 15:08.951
Why'd you quit the revival?

15:11.620 --> 15:14.331
Our last two tents were vandalized.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.502
I lost heart.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.338
A little too much of this.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.596
All my life I wanted to be near to God.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.517
The only nearness,

15:36.812 --> 15:37.938
silence.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.693
It wasn't as bad as it seemed.

15:42.776 --> 15:46.113
Better than most. Jan was a decent lady.

15:46.697 --> 15:48.574
I heard she sold the ranch a while back.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.285
I can't believe that was you.

15:51.368 --> 15:54.705
Saved up money for a place,
got a straight job.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.751
I'd run off from a bad situation
when we first met.

15:58.834 --> 16:03.297
Well, it's just so great
how you turned everything around.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.007
Look at you.

16:08.719 --> 16:11.388
Well, you're a big hero in the papers.

16:12.890 --> 16:16.268
They made a bigger deal
of that than it was.

16:17.061 --> 16:20.898
I haven't been too heroic of late.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.192
Just...

16:24.276 --> 16:25.861
You're a good man.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.948
Anybody can see that.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.660
I saw it the first time I met you.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.831
God gave us these flaws.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.084
And something I learned?

16:40.959 --> 16:43.003
He doesn't see them as flaws.

16:43.087 --> 16:46.423
There is nothing wrong
with the way he made us.

16:47.925 --> 16:51.261
The universe forgives all.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.811
You want some bourbon?

17:50.946 --> 17:52.906
What happened in 2002?

17:53.866 --> 17:56.160
You pulled our last case?

17:57.828 --> 17:59.329
Charmaine Boudreaux?

17:59.955 --> 18:03.834
It was in all the papers. Marshland Medea.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.253
- You know who Medea was?
- Yeah.

18:06.336 --> 18:09.715
We had a lot of static after that, me and him.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.885
That was a bad one.

18:13.177 --> 18:17.514
I always thought it contributed,
Rust's state of mind when he walked.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.475
SIDS.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.019
What is that?

18:22.811 --> 18:26.440
It's a four-letter word. S-I-D-S. But, I mean,

18:27.983 --> 18:29.067
what is it?

18:33.155 --> 18:36.366
It's an old word, like a curse.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.496
Not a language anyone speaks.

18:42.206 --> 18:46.001
But that's what happened to Jessica,
your first.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.087
They said.

18:49.922 --> 18:54.009
Your second, Jody. Twenty-three days old.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.224
Autopsy showed no signs of trauma, so...

19:03.143 --> 19:04.394
SIDS.

19:06.230 --> 19:08.482
I lost one myself, Charmaine.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.572
I lost a marriage, too.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.165
Now your third.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.585
You had him last year.

19:29.044 --> 19:32.214
Jesus, lady,
you ever hear of a fucking condom?

19:32.297 --> 19:33.966
Birth control's a sin.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.719
A child is a wonderful thing.

19:55.529 --> 19:57.573
A child is wonderful.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.744
You see, sometimes, people

20:04.246 --> 20:07.958
mistake a child as an answer for something.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.587
You know, like a way to change their story.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.551
Charmaine, have you ever heard
of something called

20:19.511 --> 20:21.847
Munchausen by proxy?

20:24.725 --> 20:26.018
No.

20:31.857 --> 20:34.359
At exactly 4:49 a.m.,

20:34.443 --> 20:38.363
the sleep apnea monitor that was
hooked up to your child was unplugged

20:40.324 --> 20:42.075
for 36 minutes.

20:43.285 --> 20:47.915
Then it was plugged back in, and by that time,
the child's vitals had flatlined.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.673
Charmaine, I need you
to talk to me about some things.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.510
Okay?

21:11.855 --> 21:13.106
How's it going?

21:15.150 --> 21:16.693
He's getting it.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.241
You should sign that.

21:25.702 --> 21:29.414
The newspapers
are going to be tough on you.

21:31.917 --> 21:37.547
And prison is very, very hard
on people who hurt kids.

21:40.842 --> 21:43.887
If you get the opportunity,
you should kill yourself.

21:47.265 --> 21:48.433
What?

21:52.354 --> 21:53.772
What? Please.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.277
What? Wait.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.083
Jesus!

22:14.126 --> 22:15.585
This evil bitch.

22:16.420 --> 22:20.340
I called Pennsylvania, tried to get
homicides on the first two kids,

22:20.424 --> 22:22.551
but looks like we may only have the one.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.970
- Well, it's still life.
- Yeah.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.221
Good job.

22:27.347 --> 22:30.392
Listen, Marty, type that up for me, will you?

22:31.601 --> 22:33.395
Excuse me?

22:33.478 --> 22:36.606
You got somewhere to be?
This confession is, like, 40 pages.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.025
What, you got somewhere to be?

22:38.108 --> 22:41.111
Come on, man.
You want me to tie your shoes for you, too?

22:43.613 --> 22:44.781
Hey!

22:47.242 --> 22:48.326
Hey!

22:53.415 --> 22:56.209
What the fuck's with the attitude, huh?

22:56.293 --> 22:57.919
Like my time is less than yours?

22:58.003 --> 23:00.047
You got things to do, Marty?

23:00.464 --> 23:02.883
Need to go home to the family,
play with the kids?

23:03.175 --> 23:06.553
Don't get up my ass
just 'cause you ain't getting any.

23:06.762 --> 23:09.056
You should have held onto your woman.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.974
Getting laid was good for you.

23:11.058 --> 23:13.727
God damn. You moron.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.354
God damn.

23:17.230 --> 23:20.817
You, these people, this place,
it's like you eat your fucking young

23:20.901 --> 23:24.529
and that's all just fine
as long as you got something to salute, huh?

23:26.073 --> 23:28.200
What's going on with you, man?

23:28.658 --> 23:30.327
I mean, Salter asked about it.

23:30.702 --> 23:32.370
Iberia called.

23:32.454 --> 23:36.792
You've been going around bothering people,
trying to open up old cases.

23:37.167 --> 23:40.378
I am working. I have things to do.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.673
So type the report, man.

23:44.174 --> 23:47.094
That's how we do.
I get people to talk, you write the stats.

23:47.177 --> 23:49.221
It's worked out well for you so far.

23:52.390 --> 23:55.602
I'm the only one, ever, took up for you.

23:57.145 --> 23:58.355
Ever.

23:59.064 --> 24:01.900
You know what it's like being your partner?

24:02.859 --> 24:04.152
Fuck you.

24:04.236 --> 24:06.029
No, buddy, without me,

24:07.364 --> 24:08.698
there is no you.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.036
So type the fucking report, man.

24:22.295 --> 24:25.465
We've had behaviorists in with her.
It's regressive catatonia.

24:25.674 --> 24:26.967
Seven years now.

24:27.050 --> 24:30.011
If she shows any distress,
responds in any way negatively,

24:30.095 --> 24:31.179
we're gonna have to ask you to leave.

24:31.263 --> 24:32.264
Of course.

24:32.764 --> 24:37.018
I was actually one of the men who found
Kelly at that place seven years back.

24:37.102 --> 24:38.770
She's right here.

25:03.170 --> 25:04.421
Kelly.

25:04.504 --> 25:07.799
Now you may not remember,
but you and I met a long time ago.

25:09.050 --> 25:14.431
I want to ask you a question about
those men that hurt you way back then.

25:18.351 --> 25:21.062
Do you remember
if there were more than two?

25:21.146 --> 25:23.148
Was there anyone else?

25:50.634 --> 25:55.472
The man with the scars
was the worst.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.141
My Lord.

25:59.351 --> 26:00.644
What scars?

26:05.106 --> 26:06.399
The giant.

26:10.987 --> 26:15.075
He made me watch what he did to Billy.

26:17.619 --> 26:20.455
The scars on the giant, were they on his face?

26:21.706 --> 26:22.874
His face.

26:23.541 --> 26:24.793
His face.

26:26.169 --> 26:27.337
His face.

26:34.886 --> 26:37.097
Rose, I need Haldol.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.431
Stat, please.

26:38.515 --> 26:40.016
We have to hold her. Sir, you better leave.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.533
<i>What you doing, Cohle?</i>

26:57.409 --> 26:59.661
Riling up people, opening old cases.

26:59.744 --> 27:02.122
Iberia sheriff's talking
jurisdictional complaints.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.957
Something's going on, Major.

27:04.624 --> 27:05.875
Along the coast.

27:05.959 --> 27:09.379
Women, children disappearing.

27:09.963 --> 27:12.716
Nobody hears about it.
Nobody puts them together.

27:14.050 --> 27:17.053
- First I'm hearing about it, boss.
- Puts what together, Cohle?

27:17.721 --> 27:21.850
Someone, maybe more than one,
is killing people, Major.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.228
They've been doing it for a long time.

27:26.187 --> 27:27.731
You got any bodies?

27:28.315 --> 27:31.568
You got something that actually applies
to your job as a homicide detective?

27:31.651 --> 27:35.363
Know what he did? Know what he did?
Goes and visits Kelly Reider.

27:36.281 --> 27:37.699
Sent her into a screaming fit.

27:38.074 --> 27:42.245
Look, either we don't find them or they
don't get connected, I don't know which.

27:42.329 --> 27:46.833
I can't decide if it's a cover-up
or the garden variety incompetence here.

27:47.917 --> 27:51.671
I mean, it has to do with those boys
we got in '95, the Dora Lange killing.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.757
We didn't get them all.

27:54.174 --> 27:56.301
You're building up something in your head.

27:56.384 --> 27:57.844
Women and children.

27:58.094 --> 28:00.513
How did they get no press?

28:00.597 --> 28:03.350
The way things in the bayou get no press.

28:03.725 --> 28:07.604
And it's happening in the same area
where that Voudon shit goes down.

28:07.687 --> 28:10.940
And it's happening in the same area
where those schools were set up.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.525
What the fuck schools you talking about?

28:12.609 --> 28:14.527
Tuition reimbursement programs

28:14.611 --> 28:18.156
for rural and Christian schools
founded by Billy Lee Tuttle.

28:18.823 --> 28:20.492
Yeah, think about it.

28:20.575 --> 28:23.870
Back in '95, why was he so fired up
to get his ass down here?

28:23.953 --> 28:26.539
Comes barging in with his task force.

28:26.706 --> 28:27.707
Fuck.

28:27.791 --> 28:31.461
Before we even got started on the case,
he took it over. Why?

28:32.462 --> 28:34.798
'Cause he recognized something in it.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.133
We're in a muddy swamp here, man.

28:37.217 --> 28:41.554
The alligators are swimming around us and
we don't even know whether they're there.

28:41.638 --> 28:42.931
You know why?

28:45.058 --> 28:46.559
'Cause we don't see them.

28:46.643 --> 28:51.564
I caught zero logic in all that.
And that last bit, pure gibberish.

28:51.648 --> 28:56.611
How about we track all the missing persons
within 10 miles of every Walmart, huh?

28:56.694 --> 28:59.239
Right along the I-10.
Why don't we go after Sam Walmart?

28:59.322 --> 29:02.158
I'm fixing to pull you
for mental exhaustion, man.

29:02.659 --> 29:06.621
You want to stay on, do not ever, ever
say that to anyone in the state again.

29:08.081 --> 29:09.332
Sure.

29:11.334 --> 29:13.378
That's some fucking nerve you got, buddy.

29:14.379 --> 29:17.090
You need to take a few steps back, Rust.

29:17.424 --> 29:18.758
- Right now.
- Hey.

29:20.009 --> 29:21.511
No more visiting victims' families.

29:21.594 --> 29:24.264
You will stop trying to turn
missing persons into homicides

29:24.347 --> 29:25.849
as you do not have any bodies.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.351
That's a direct fucking order, you hear me?

29:28.435 --> 29:32.272
You do anything else, I'll have you on
insubordination and I will suspend you.

29:32.355 --> 29:33.606
Please, take some time.

29:33.690 --> 29:35.525
Go on one of them
fishing tours or something.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.944
All right? Get yourself together.

29:53.960 --> 29:57.088
And a little less than two years ago,
Tuttle overdosed.

29:57.714 --> 29:59.132
Accidentally supposedly.

29:59.382 --> 30:00.633
You mentioned that already.

30:00.717 --> 30:04.304
Couple weeks before he died,
Tuttle's house in Shreveport was broken into.

30:04.387 --> 30:06.181
Found out his Baton Rouge one was, too.

30:06.931 --> 30:08.558
Wasn't reported.

30:09.225 --> 30:10.560
So?

30:10.643 --> 30:12.061
So your man
gets a hard-on for Tuttle.

30:12.687 --> 30:15.940
Man's house gets broken into
right after Cohle turns back up in the state.

30:16.524 --> 30:20.653
What's he been doing since here?
Drinking? Bartending?

30:20.737 --> 30:24.365
Dude with a mind like that,
do you think that's all he get up to?

30:24.449 --> 30:26.910
Marty, he never went anywhere.

30:27.702 --> 30:29.454
He never left.

30:29.537 --> 30:32.582
He's been right here
doing bad things a long time.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.298
Hey, hey, hey, hold up now.

30:40.381 --> 30:43.384
I've been in this room a long time, gentlemen.

30:44.928 --> 30:49.224
Whatever Rusty is or was or became,

30:51.226 --> 30:52.894
don't call me again.

30:53.228 --> 30:54.604
I won't help you.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.439
We're trying to help him, Marty.

31:22.674 --> 31:24.884
Hey, did you have a good day?

31:25.093 --> 31:27.220
Well, why don't you
get that bathroom cleaned finally?

31:27.303 --> 31:29.472
Get all the toothpaste out.

31:29.556 --> 31:30.765
Thanks.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.511
Marty, I didn't know you were home.

32:09.012 --> 32:11.806
Oh, yeah. Just cleaning up.
Be out in a sec.

32:16.853 --> 32:18.730
I'll heat up something.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.524
Hey, those flowers came in nice!

32:22.066 --> 32:24.861
You were right.
They really brighten up the yard.

32:30.241 --> 32:31.326
Hey!

32:31.868 --> 32:34.412
I was thinking, we're due for a date night.

32:35.413 --> 32:37.373
Don't you think? You and me?

32:38.916 --> 32:44.422
I'm gonna dress up,
we'll go for a nice dinner, a movie.

32:45.715 --> 32:47.550
Yeah? That sound good?

32:51.220 --> 32:52.388
Honey!

32:52.722 --> 32:53.848
Sure.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.744
Thanks, hon.

33:15.370 --> 33:16.454
Nice.

33:23.086 --> 33:26.089
So, is my eldest
still offended by my presence?

33:33.596 --> 33:35.014
Yeah, I don't mind.

33:35.098 --> 33:38.393
I'm happy just to sit here
with three beautiful women watching...

33:39.602 --> 33:41.354
What is this?

33:41.437 --> 33:43.773
<i>Dumb Blonds in Cracker Country?</i>

33:55.451 --> 33:56.744
Hey, hon.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.455
Do me a favor? Find the game.

34:02.709 --> 34:04.794
Here you go. I have to study.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.547
Good girl.

34:27.817 --> 34:28.943
What?

34:29.944 --> 34:31.154
Nothing.

34:32.780 --> 34:35.283
Now, this pasta is great.

34:35.825 --> 34:38.286
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

34:43.332 --> 34:44.667
I love you.

34:46.711 --> 34:48.045
Thank you.

34:52.383 --> 34:54.886
Can you turn it down some, please?

34:54.969 --> 34:56.053
Sure.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.311
How's that?

35:05.521 --> 35:10.026
We were talking once
about growing up, parents,

35:10.777 --> 35:12.445
I said something about forgiveness,

35:12.528 --> 35:16.699
and he said
that there is no such thing as forgiveness.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.661
That people just have short memories.

35:20.745 --> 35:23.456
Do you think Cohle was wrong about that?

35:23.539 --> 35:24.916
Forgiveness?

35:25.917 --> 35:27.627
Less and less.

35:54.111 --> 35:55.154
Can I get you a drink, miss?

35:57.156 --> 36:01.619
Thank you. Sure.
A vodka martini, extra dirty.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.248
Margaret.

36:05.873 --> 36:07.708
- Bruce. Hi.
- Hi.

36:12.839 --> 36:15.007
So, you waiting for someone?

36:16.259 --> 36:17.260
No.

36:20.721 --> 36:23.641
<i>You and Marty split prior, right?</i>

36:24.100 --> 36:25.142
In '95?

36:29.188 --> 36:31.649
- Are either of you married?
- Got an ex.

36:32.900 --> 36:36.279
- Still on the first.
- It's difficult to admit defeat.

36:38.948 --> 36:40.700
Marty quit drinking.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.578
Found religion for a while.

36:44.287 --> 36:45.830
I didn't love that.

36:46.497 --> 36:49.792
To be honest, I preferred him before.
He had a sense of humor then.

36:50.334 --> 36:53.880
But we stayed together seven more years,
some of it pretty good.

36:53.963 --> 36:55.256
2002?

36:56.132 --> 36:57.967
Cohle's bad year, too.

36:58.426 --> 37:01.429
Rust was an intense man,
but he had integrity.

37:01.971 --> 37:03.389
He was responsible.

37:04.515 --> 37:07.476
<i>Not a lot of responsible people in the world.</i>

37:16.485 --> 37:19.572
<i>Reverend, thanks for taking the time
to see me on such short notice.</i>

37:19.655 --> 37:21.824
Of course, Detective. Please.

37:23.159 --> 37:26.078
It's a very interesting building.

37:26.162 --> 37:31.167
This was the first. Built it in 1980.
The rest of the campus grew around it.

37:32.001 --> 37:34.629
Now, I remembered you, of course.

37:35.421 --> 37:39.967
- People of this state owe you a great deal.
- Not as much as they owe you.

37:41.302 --> 37:44.597
Charitable organizations.
Education initiatives.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.391
Thank you.
We're very proud of our ministries.

37:47.475 --> 37:50.519
I don't do as much preaching as I used to,

37:51.020 --> 37:53.981
but the Legacy programs
are more my focus now.

37:54.065 --> 37:57.068
The things like the State Policeman's Charity.

37:58.402 --> 38:00.071
What did you want to talk about, son?

38:01.405 --> 38:03.324
The Wellspring program.

38:04.033 --> 38:06.744
Mid-'80s through the early '90s,
you remember that?

38:07.036 --> 38:09.163
Well, of course I remember.

38:09.372 --> 38:13.417
I'm trying to locate old personnel, faculty,

38:13.501 --> 38:16.087
but I'm having a little bit of trouble
acquiring names.

38:16.170 --> 38:19.715
Well, the program was shut down officially,
you know, maybe 10 years ago.

38:19.799 --> 38:21.801
I never had much ground contact with it,

38:21.884 --> 38:25.846
but it involved a number of private schools,
enterprises, you understand,

38:25.930 --> 38:28.432
that would adopt our standard of curriculum,

38:28.516 --> 38:32.812
and in return receive tuition reimbursement
for underprivileged students.

38:32.895 --> 38:37.733
You got any files? Any list of faculty?

38:37.984 --> 38:40.945
Well, that's what I'm getting at
is that these were private institutions,

38:41.028 --> 38:44.198
so you'd have to track down
their administrators, I believe.

38:44.281 --> 38:45.408
That's the thing.

38:45.741 --> 38:48.869
See, all the schools
dissolved with the program.

38:49.245 --> 38:53.624
And I'm trying to find some tax info,
but there were religious exemptions.

38:53.708 --> 38:56.335
Well, there's our archives, of course.

38:56.419 --> 38:57.920
Now, we did lose a lot of files.

38:58.004 --> 39:01.090
We had some flooding
on one of the sub-floors.

39:02.383 --> 39:05.344
But, you know, I think I should put you
together with one of our clerical workers

39:05.428 --> 39:07.555
and see if they can't help you find something.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.808
Thank you. Just before you do that,

39:11.767 --> 39:15.438
former deacon of yours, Austin Farrar...

39:18.733 --> 39:21.277
That was very, very unfortunate.

39:22.319 --> 39:24.113
Yet he was dismissed.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.406
Evidence had accrued.

39:26.198 --> 39:31.495
It became apparent that Austin
had implemented certain funds.

39:32.913 --> 39:34.915
Well, "embezzling" is the word.

39:34.999 --> 39:39.462
We elected to handle it internally
rather than pursuing formal charges.

39:39.879 --> 39:42.923
And then he had his accident.

39:44.967 --> 39:48.471
I'd heard he had taken it hard, drinking.

39:50.890 --> 39:54.268
I've seen more souls lost down a bottle
than any pit.

39:55.686 --> 40:01.567
At the same time, it's hard to trust a man
who can't trust himself with a beer.

40:01.650 --> 40:02.902
Don't you think?

40:05.613 --> 40:07.656
But what's this all about?

40:08.991 --> 40:12.411
Wellspring program, Austin Farrar?

40:12.495 --> 40:14.330
Dead women and children.

40:18.167 --> 40:19.460
Terrible.

40:20.169 --> 40:21.754
That's terrible.

40:22.630 --> 40:25.049
How's that? What you're working on?

40:26.008 --> 40:29.428
I can't say anything about it at this point,
Reverend.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.767
I'd like to set you up with a clerk.

40:38.020 --> 40:39.814
You can look at

40:40.981 --> 40:45.444
whatever information
we still have from Wellspring.

40:51.325 --> 40:54.286
Why did the Wellspring program shut down,
Reverend?

40:54.370 --> 40:56.580
It couldn't sustain its costs.

40:57.331 --> 40:59.542
The whole idea was to provide an alternative

40:59.625 --> 41:04.672
to the kind of secular, globalized education
that our public schools were promoting.

41:05.339 --> 41:10.302
When we get the school voucher program
instituted, we'll reintroduce the idea.

41:10.719 --> 41:13.931
People should have a choice in education,
like anything else.

41:15.933 --> 41:20.896
Steve, would you show the detective
to our old archives for outside ministries?

41:21.188 --> 41:23.274
- Yes, sir.
- I'll call ahead.

41:23.357 --> 41:27.361
I'm gonna come back for that.
Reverend, thank you for your time today.

41:29.238 --> 41:30.990
Godspeed, Detective.

41:34.994 --> 41:36.996
You'll be in my thoughts.

41:40.082 --> 41:43.878
<i>Just the one more time.
I just need it one more time.</i>

41:44.920 --> 41:47.882
Beth, if you knew the day I just had...

41:50.259 --> 41:53.596
<i>Then tell me about it.
I want to hear about it.</i>

41:57.141 --> 41:58.893
No, you do not.

42:00.019 --> 42:02.605
I really wanted to see you.

42:04.648 --> 42:07.568
- I've been thinking about something all week.
<i>- Don't.</i>

42:08.235 --> 42:11.530
- Ever since last time...
<i>- Don't, okay? I just...</i>

42:11.947 --> 42:15.117
Haven't been able to think of anything else,
tell you the truth.

42:17.620 --> 42:18.954
Like what?

42:20.372 --> 42:22.166
<i>I've been thinking...</i>

42:25.211 --> 42:29.215
I think I want you to fuck me in my ass.

42:32.009 --> 42:35.095
- Beth.
<i>- I've never done that before,</i>

42:35.596 --> 42:38.224
but I think I want you to do it to me.

42:38.807 --> 42:40.517
<i>I want you so bad.</i>

42:40.851 --> 42:43.479
You're out of your goddamn mind.

42:45.147 --> 42:46.941
What did I tell you?

42:47.650 --> 42:50.444
You're fucking unbelievable, boy.
You know about this?

42:51.612 --> 42:53.906
I'm not sure
what we're talking about here.

42:53.989 --> 42:56.408
Your partner here, he braced Billy Lee Tuttle.

42:56.492 --> 42:59.745
"Braced." Are you fucking kidding me?
It was a friendly conversation.

42:59.828 --> 43:00.955
Hey, dipshit.

43:01.163 --> 43:04.375
You don't get to decide
what kind of conversation it was.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.418
Why did you talk to Billy Lee Tuttle?

43:06.502 --> 43:07.586
And, you, look at you.

43:07.670 --> 43:10.589
You look like you haven't seen
your own bed in a couple days, huh?

43:10.673 --> 43:12.383
Yeah? What the fuck is wrong with you two?

43:13.217 --> 43:15.135
Well, I can't speak for Rust,

43:15.219 --> 43:17.137
but I've got the flu.

43:17.221 --> 43:18.973
I didn't know that was going around.

43:19.056 --> 43:21.016
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

43:21.100 --> 43:23.352
If he was pissed off
after the conversation we had,

43:23.435 --> 43:26.730
- then I am onto fucking something...
- Shut the fuck up. I told you.

43:26.814 --> 43:29.692
I fucking told you!
And human tampon here heard me.

43:29.775 --> 43:33.570
Badge and gun, Cohle. You're suspended.
One month without pay.

43:33.654 --> 43:37.324
Repeated rank insubordination,
misallocation of departmental resources.

43:37.408 --> 43:39.952
- Come on.
- Leroy. Come on. That's over the top.

43:40.035 --> 43:42.788
Don't you fucking Leroy me! I told you both.

43:42.871 --> 43:46.250
Cut the shit! It's done. Badge and gun, Cohle.

43:50.838 --> 43:53.299
And before your official reinstatement,

43:53.382 --> 43:56.051
you have 30 hours
mandated departmental counseling.

43:56.135 --> 43:57.428
You fucking serious?

43:57.511 --> 44:00.097
This guy, right?
I got to kick you in the fucking head.

44:00.597 --> 44:04.727
I'm the person least in need of counseling
in this entire fucking state.

44:04.810 --> 44:06.687
You ain't acting right, you don't sound right,

44:06.770 --> 44:09.148
you're up my ass, and you were warned.

44:47.436 --> 44:48.520
What?

44:49.063 --> 44:50.814
He's doing it again.

44:53.108 --> 44:54.860
He's been doing it.

44:56.403 --> 44:58.280
I can't live with it.

45:04.536 --> 45:06.413
I can't live with it.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.796
I can't deal with it.

45:14.129 --> 45:15.464
Not again.

45:17.841 --> 45:19.301
Did you know?

45:20.677 --> 45:22.137
Did you know?

45:25.140 --> 45:26.183
No.

45:47.329 --> 45:49.415
What are you doing in here?

45:50.332 --> 45:51.792
What happened?

45:52.459 --> 45:54.044
I'm off the job.

46:00.342 --> 46:02.094
That's not what I mean.

46:10.727 --> 46:12.729
You can't live like this.

46:16.150 --> 46:19.069
You know, people give me advice,
I reckon they're talking to themselves.

46:19.153 --> 46:21.029
What are you doing?

46:21.113 --> 46:24.074
Some people, no matter where they look,
they see themselves.

46:37.379 --> 46:41.800
Be honest with me now.

48:08.637 --> 48:12.057
What the fuck are you doing here?

48:14.351 --> 48:15.686
I'm sorry.

48:18.689 --> 48:20.190
It wasn't you.

48:20.816 --> 48:22.234
Really, I...

48:25.153 --> 48:29.283
I wasn't even sure I could do it.
Seventeen years is a long time.

48:31.702 --> 48:36.206
I almost went with a stranger in a bar.

48:37.374 --> 48:39.042
I'm sorry, Rust.

48:40.502 --> 48:41.920
He'll have to go, you see,

48:42.004 --> 48:44.756
because this, he won't live with.

48:45.257 --> 48:47.676
- Get the fuck out of here.
- This...

48:48.885 --> 48:50.846
- Get the fuck...
- This will hurt him.

48:50.929 --> 48:52.931
Get the fuck out of here right now.

48:53.015 --> 48:54.266
I'm sorry, but thank you.

48:54.349 --> 48:56.852
You need to get the fuck out of here.

48:58.270 --> 49:00.272
Get the fuck out of here!

49:10.449 --> 49:13.452
<i>Do you know what was going on
with Cohle around that time?</i>

49:16.204 --> 49:17.247
No.

49:17.873 --> 49:20.042
I knew that he got suspended,

49:20.542 --> 49:24.463
and that he quit after he and Marty had his...

49:25.380 --> 49:26.673
They had their thing.

49:27.049 --> 49:28.258
That's it.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.844
So, your split with Marty,

49:32.054 --> 49:34.431
that had nothing to do with Cohle?

49:36.391 --> 49:37.392
No.

50:02.584 --> 50:03.752
Hey, hon.

50:11.259 --> 50:13.595
- Hi, Marty.
- How are you doing?

50:15.055 --> 50:16.306
Sit down.

50:18.350 --> 50:19.434
Okay.

50:22.229 --> 50:23.647
I have to tell you something.

50:30.153 --> 50:32.572
I saw the pictures on your phone.

50:34.533 --> 50:36.076
B?

50:36.868 --> 50:38.870
- Now, honey...
- Nice ass, Marty.

50:38.954 --> 50:39.996
No. I cannot...

50:40.080 --> 50:41.873
I was maybe always a little too skinny for you.

50:41.957 --> 50:44.960
No. I cannot help it if some crazy bitch...

50:45.043 --> 50:46.837
I slept with someone.

50:53.468 --> 50:55.095
And you know him.

50:57.139 --> 50:58.640
You're close.

51:02.477 --> 51:03.520
Who?

51:05.021 --> 51:06.440
It was Rust.

51:07.065 --> 51:09.151
I fucked your partner Rust.

51:17.117 --> 51:19.619
What are you saying? What are you...

51:19.995 --> 51:21.747
What the fuck are you saying to me?

51:21.830 --> 51:23.373
I already told you.

51:28.003 --> 51:30.881
- You fucking whore.
- You don't know the half of it.

51:31.923 --> 51:36.219
To tell you the truth, I haven't been
fucked like that since before the girls.

51:42.851 --> 51:44.519
Do it! Do it!

51:47.022 --> 51:49.900
At least you'll have something
to explain to your daughters.

51:52.152 --> 51:54.362
Get your fucking hands off me.

51:56.364 --> 51:57.574
Coward!

52:24.851 --> 52:26.478
Cohle's outside.

52:26.853 --> 52:29.231
Does he know he's suspended?

52:55.632 --> 52:57.425
I was coming for my files, Marty.

53:09.104 --> 53:10.689
Come on, swing, Marty!

53:10.772 --> 53:13.066
You're getting your ass kicked!

53:13.775 --> 53:15.902
Oh, my God. Get Salter. Get Salter!

53:16.319 --> 53:18.280
Hurry up! Stop them!

53:20.031 --> 53:21.199
Stop!

53:23.118 --> 53:25.120
- Stay down, Marty.
- Come on now.

53:25.287 --> 53:26.872
Don't do it! Stop them!

53:26.955 --> 53:28.039
Get up, get up!

53:28.123 --> 53:29.708
- Calm down, Marty.
- That's enough now!

53:32.252 --> 53:34.212
Hey! All right, back off, guys!

53:34.296 --> 53:35.297
- Come on!
- Come on!

53:35.380 --> 53:36.882
- Get him out of here!
- Come on.

53:36.965 --> 53:38.425
Get him the fuck out of here.

53:38.508 --> 53:40.385
- Fuck you!
- Calm down, Marty.

53:40.468 --> 53:42.929
- Cohle!
- You better calm your shit right now!

53:43.722 --> 53:45.098
Get inside!

53:45.390 --> 53:48.643
You're standing around watching this shit?
Get the fuck inside!

53:48.727 --> 53:50.312
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

53:50.395 --> 53:52.522
- Get him inside. Get him inside.
- We ain't done here!

53:52.606 --> 53:54.399
- Get him inside.
- We ain't done here!

53:58.278 --> 54:00.530
I'm gonna need some fucking detail here,
you two.

54:00.614 --> 54:03.199
It's a personal matter
between us, boss.

54:03.825 --> 54:06.161
Is there anybody pressing charges?

54:06.620 --> 54:07.829
Not me.

54:09.873 --> 54:12.208
You want to say anything, Cohle?

54:14.628 --> 54:15.879
No.

54:15.962 --> 54:20.091
This man right here is the only pal you have.
You understand that?

54:20.175 --> 54:22.344
Fuck him. I ain't his pal.

54:26.014 --> 54:27.182
I quit.

54:27.766 --> 54:28.808
You serious?

54:28.892 --> 54:32.938
I'll send you a letter.
Yeah, fuck this. Fuck this world, man.

54:35.190 --> 54:36.858
Nice hook, Marty.

54:42.656 --> 54:45.033
You're not gonna go into this, huh? Really?

54:47.702 --> 54:50.455
You two fucked each other up pretty good.

54:50.705 --> 54:51.915
No shit.

54:59.839 --> 55:02.425
<i>What about when he quit?
Any idea why?</i>

55:03.760 --> 55:06.096
<i>Maybe it was
old stuff between them.</i>

55:07.597 --> 55:09.808
Way they always rubbed wrong.

55:11.309 --> 55:13.728
I never learned what it was about.

56:07.615 --> 56:08.783
Marty.

56:09.743 --> 56:10.827
Rust.

56:12.370 --> 56:13.371
Long time.

56:15.081 --> 56:16.416
Long time.

56:17.959 --> 56:19.586
Changed your hair.

56:21.129 --> 56:23.465
Thought maybe we should talk.

56:23.548 --> 56:24.632
Yeah?

56:25.633 --> 56:26.968
Buy you a beer?

56:30.722 --> 56:32.807
Sure. I'll follow you.

56:42.859 --> 56:45.070
Actually, why don't you buy me a beer?
