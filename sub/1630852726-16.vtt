00:04.787 --> 00:06.006
Hello?

00:06.006 --> 00:08.791
Barry, my bud,
we just wanted to check-in

00:08.791 --> 00:10.488
before
our jet blasts off.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.795
We're trusting you with the
house while we're gone, honey.

00:12.795 --> 00:15.928
Just use your best judgment.

00:15.928 --> 00:19.845
I judge these canapes
to be delicious.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.325
And easy to say.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.631
Canapes.

00:22.631 --> 00:25.764
Easy on the tongue,
in two different ways.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.158
Check it out!

00:28.158 --> 00:29.464
For our quiet night in,

00:29.464 --> 00:31.683
I made "kuh-nap-plops"--
dammit!

00:31.683 --> 00:34.817
Barry, baby,
"quiet night-in"?

00:34.817 --> 00:36.123
"Kuhnapplops"?

00:36.123 --> 00:37.385
What are you
talking about?

00:37.385 --> 00:40.127
We got your parents' house
to ourselves--

00:40.127 --> 00:42.042
Your parents' party house.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.045
And Steve and Toshi
leave tomorrow to pitch

00:45.045 --> 00:48.178
their Bowties for Babies idea
on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

00:48.178 --> 00:49.788
We gotta party.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.486
It's true, Barry.
We must party.

00:51.486 --> 00:54.184
This mini fridge is stocked
with energy drinks.

00:54.184 --> 00:57.883
No way. Those are my parents'
"Freak Fuels" for sex time.

00:57.883 --> 01:00.016
- They're off limits.
- And...

01:00.016 --> 01:04.760
your dad's hifi stereo
is begging to be played.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.371
Absolutely off limits!

01:07.371 --> 01:10.244
My dad loves his stereo
more than poonani!

01:10.244 --> 01:11.375
His words!

01:11.375 --> 01:14.204
Barry,
nothing's off limits.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.728
Nothing? But why?

01:16.728 --> 01:18.730
Because you're Barry.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.081
You're a pushover, dude.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.474
It's like what we love
most about you.

01:23.474 --> 01:26.260
Steve,

it's not that bad--

01:47.803 --> 01:49.413
Nope, these are
ruined forever.

01:49.413 --> 01:52.024
Snot, I need you to run
damage control on this one.

01:52.024 --> 01:55.332
<i>Shark Tank Junior</i> has a strict
"no bad boys" policy,

01:55.332 --> 01:57.421
so Tosh and I gotta
distance ourselves

01:57.421 --> 01:58.596
from this cluster

01:58.596 --> 02:00.250

02:00.250 --> 02:03.645

02:53.738 --> 02:55.740

I searched Craigslist

03:01.616 --> 03:02.704
No way!

03:02.704 --> 03:04.271
There's dinner rolls
in here.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.840
Just text the guy.

03:08.840 --> 03:15.151
"Hi. I'm interested in the
speakers you have for sale."

03:15.151 --> 03:16.370
Now we wait.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.023
"I heard you want

03:18.023 --> 03:19.677
to buy some speakers."

03:19.677 --> 03:21.331
Now we go.

03:23.855 --> 03:27.511
Uh, I'm not sure
that's your best look, Stan.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.860
What? Why?

03:28.860 --> 03:30.688
'Cause one of your balls
just came out.

03:30.688 --> 03:33.038
Oh, my God.

03:33.038 --> 03:36.216
My old wrestling singlet
is my most athletic garment.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.174
And I'll need it if
I'm finally going to execute

03:38.174 --> 03:39.523
a standing backflip.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.525
Since when have you
wanted to flip?

03:41.525 --> 03:43.310
Oh [bleep] you,
Francine!

03:43.310 --> 03:45.486
You know I've always wanted
to do a backflip!

03:45.486 --> 03:47.531
Pfft, 'kay.
Whatever. Do a flip.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.054
A backflip.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.056
Today it's stretching, flexibility,

03:51.056 --> 03:52.710
and strength training.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.888
Okay.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.238
Now it's both balls.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.762
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

04:00.762 --> 04:03.417
You're a cool dad, Stan.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.204
Well, this is it.
Ring the bell.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.293
I was peepin'
through my peephole!

04:10.293 --> 04:12.991
Name's Wally Wrobel,
but call me Wrobel.

04:12.991 --> 04:15.646
Um, I'm Snot,
and this is Barry.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.866
Mind if I
call you both Wrobel?

04:17.866 --> 04:20.608
Gah, just effin' ya--
I mean effin' with ya.

04:20.608 --> 04:24.046
I'm an audiophile, not
a pedophile for cryin' out loud!

04:24.046 --> 04:26.266
Get in here, all my neighbors
are pedophiles.

04:32.663 --> 04:35.492
So, which boy is interested
in my speakers?

04:35.492 --> 04:37.973
That'd be me.
Boy Barry.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.191
Watch where you're walkin'.

04:39.191 --> 04:40.802
I got speaker parts
all over the place.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.020
Last thing I need
is one of you

04:42.020 --> 04:43.413
steppin' on a woofer.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.546
Dammit,
now I'm stepping on woofers.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.852
Oh, well.

04:47.852 --> 04:51.073
I guess as long as you buy
my speakers, no harm no foul.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.902
You are a serious buyer,
aren't you?

04:53.902 --> 04:55.773
Yes?

04:55.773 --> 04:57.253
Phew. Good.

04:57.253 --> 04:59.908
I don't like people
wasting my time, kicking tires.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.345
This is Khaleesi.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.652
She also only likes
serious buyers.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.044
Aah!

05:06.044 --> 05:08.351
Khaleesi, huh? Cool.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.527
- Like from <i>Game Of Thrones?</i>
- Never heard of it.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.703
I'm more of
a <i>Big Bang</i> guy myself.

05:12.703 --> 05:15.271
It's what inspired me
to live in an apartment.

05:15.271 --> 05:16.925
Well, here they are.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.927
My JCL 100s.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.929
A lot of blood, sweat,
and tears

05:20.929 --> 05:22.757
went into restoring
these babies.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.062
They look great.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.586
Thank you.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.588
Thank you for saying that.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.024
Now for the demo.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.155
Sit, sit.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.592
So what did you
bring to listen to?

05:31.592 --> 05:34.638
Uh, I didn't
bring anything.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.685
Aah!

05:37.685 --> 05:40.340
I suppose I can dig
something up for you.

05:43.778 --> 05:46.302

Mmm. Makes my vodka and Squirt
nice and cold.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.740
I read that the secret
to executing a standing backflip

07:16.740 --> 07:19.439
is building up
loads of arm-momentum.

one of these bad boys

10:43.077 --> 10:44.556
into your dick hole?

10:52.826 --> 10:56.481
Hmm. Looks like somebody had
a long, nasty, dank-ass slip.

10:56.481 --> 10:57.613
It was me, Doc.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.006
Nasty as they come.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.922
Do you mind?
I'm talking to the slipper.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.533
Says here an oddly-shaped
piece of ice

11:04.533 --> 11:07.841
was responsible for this
incredible, incredible slip.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.365
Would you say it looked
something like this?

11:10.365 --> 11:12.715
Yeah. Except a little bit up
on this side,

11:12.715 --> 11:14.369
and a little bit
down on that side.

11:14.369 --> 11:17.851
Of course. That would lead
to infinite slip!

11:17.851 --> 11:21.637
Not that I care, it's just that
would be very interesting

11:21.637 --> 11:23.378
to someone who devoted
their whole life

11:23.378 --> 11:24.684
to the science of slipping.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.382
Dr. Slippy?
Get away from my patient!

11:27.382 --> 11:29.384
No problem.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.212
I think I got everything
I needed.

11:31.212 --> 11:33.475
Anyway.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.651
Stan, I have horrible news.

11:35.651 --> 11:38.001
You will never walk again.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.395
- Oh, God--
- Do you mind?

11:40.395 --> 11:42.658
Because of the nature
of your fall,

11:42.658 --> 11:46.140
you will only be able
to backflip from now on.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.663
I'm so confused.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.317
Why was Dr. Slippy here?

11:49.317 --> 11:51.885
Oh, ugh, he's always sniffing
around the slip ward

11:51.885 --> 11:54.496
looking for slippery things
to patent.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.324
But, Stan, did you hear me?

11:56.324 --> 11:57.629
You'll never walk again.

11:57.629 --> 11:58.892
Oh, God.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.763
Is he gonna patent
the ice shape?

12:00.763 --> 12:02.069
- Is that worth money?
- Totally.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.418
If he cracks
the slip barrier,

12:03.418 --> 12:04.898
then it would be
worth billions.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.116
I need to get to
the patent office

12:06.116 --> 12:07.248
before Dr. Slippy!

12:07.248 --> 12:08.466
But you can't walk!

12:08.466 --> 12:10.512
Then I'll backflip!

12:10.512 --> 12:12.470
Yeah,
I'm gonna stay here.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.298
He didn't
finish his pills.

12:14.298 --> 12:16.431
Doctor, a truck full
of banana peels

12:16.431 --> 12:17.824
tipped over
on the highway.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.435
We've got 35 slip victims
headed this way!

12:20.435 --> 12:22.002
Call my wife.

12:22.002 --> 12:25.657
Tell her... something hilarious
is happening.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.799
It's just Dad.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.806
Wrobel.

12:46.504 --> 12:49.638
Oh, good, it's just a speaker.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.380
-<i>♪ When I get up...♪</i>
- Eeee-yaaa!

12:55.992 --> 12:57.298
Hello?

12:57.298 --> 13:02.085
Barrrryyyy deeeaaaaad.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.917
Dad! Please tell me
I'm having a nightmare!

13:07.917 --> 13:09.789
I wish,
because then when you wake up,

13:09.789 --> 13:12.095
my JCLs
wouldn't sound so off.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.142
They sound fine to me!

13:15.142 --> 13:17.884
- Barry, they're not even on.
- Still.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.843
Not to worry. I got a guy
coming to fix them.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.152
Hey there, buckaroo.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.197
- Aah!
- Barry, what's gotten into you?

13:27.197 --> 13:28.764
Sorry about that,
Mr. Wrobel.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.461
Please.
Just Wrobel.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.115
Of course. I'm Ted.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.377
Mind if I
call you Wrobel?

13:33.377 --> 13:35.510
He gets it!

13:37.860 --> 13:40.689
Real "noice" JCL 100s.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.691
I actually just restored a set
of these babies

13:42.691 --> 13:43.823
for the second time.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.912
Whoa! Not so fast!

13:47.609 --> 13:49.002
You're dead.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.568
That's a good joke.

13:56.270 --> 13:59.490
Wrobel was in my house, Snot!

13:59.490 --> 14:02.102
Listen,
here's what you gotta do.

14:02.102 --> 14:06.323
Go to the police and tell them
Wrobel showed you his dick.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.978
No! I'm done
being a pushover!

14:08.978 --> 14:11.720
And I'm going to do what I
wanted to do in the first place!

14:11.720 --> 14:13.940
I'm telling my dad everything.

14:16.464 --> 14:19.206
Mike, this Wrobel guy
was stalking my son!

14:19.206 --> 14:21.382
Easy, Teddy Bear!
I got this.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.732
- We demand a restraining order.
- Agreed.

14:23.732 --> 14:26.039
My client will not come
within 100 yards

14:26.039 --> 14:27.997
of Barry or his family.

14:27.997 --> 14:30.565
In addition, my client's
petition for visitation rights

14:30.565 --> 14:32.306
with Barry
has been withdrawn.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.569
I don't even know
why he asked for that.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.488
Hey,
let me grab you a sec

14:40.488 --> 14:42.185
before that restraining
order kicks in

14:42.185 --> 14:44.535
and I have to yell everything
from 100 yards.

14:44.535 --> 14:45.885
You're still a pushover.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.017
Nuh-uh,
I stood up for myself.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.758
No, not really, no.

14:49.758 --> 14:52.543
Your daddy and his lawyer
stood up to me, but you?

14:52.543 --> 14:54.545
No. No, you did not
stand up to me.

14:54.545 --> 14:57.200
No, no.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.898
Say, what's going on
with your face?

14:58.898 --> 15:01.204
Ah, never mind.
I don't care. Bye!

15:04.947 --> 15:07.341
C'mon, poo already, butthole.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.736
"Motion at your front door."

15:11.736 --> 15:13.521
Kewl.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.610
Well, well, well,

15:15.610 --> 15:18.526
look who came crawling back
for my speakers.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.397
But if he thinks I'm gonna
straight-up trade

15:20.397 --> 15:22.269
for that sledgehammer...

15:22.269 --> 15:24.619
Well, I don't know.
Today I could. I'm feeling it.

15:25.837 --> 15:29.363
Who's standing up
for himself now?!

15:29.363 --> 15:31.365
The 10-second delay!

15:33.845 --> 15:35.282
Khaleesi, help!

15:35.282 --> 15:36.631
Call the police!

15:36.631 --> 15:38.807
And tell them to bring
toilet paper!

15:38.807 --> 15:41.505
You sure you wanna
press charges?

15:41.505 --> 15:44.160
- He'll do some time if you do.
- Good.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.598
Some serious time
for an unserious buyer.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.861
Doing time
for wasting my time.

15:49.861 --> 15:52.125
Anyways, you guys wanna come in
for some White Claws?

15:52.125 --> 15:53.169
Sounds good.

16:01.351 --> 16:06.095
Make... them... pay!

16:06.095 --> 16:09.055
Aah!

16:09.055 --> 16:11.840
Robinson. You're gettin' out.
Pack it up.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.017
Don't tell me what to do!

16:15.017 --> 16:17.889
Oh!
This job's the worst!

16:20.370 --> 16:23.330
Stan,
it's been three months!

16:23.330 --> 16:26.550
You've gotta get over the fact
that you couldn't backflip

16:26.550 --> 16:27.987
to the patent office

16:27.987 --> 16:31.033
as fast as Dr. Slippy
could slip there!

16:31.033 --> 16:32.861
But I'm the one
who slipped on it!

16:32.861 --> 16:34.558
I should be
the flippin' billionaire!

16:34.558 --> 16:36.212
I'll get it.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.431
No, I can do it.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.131
Well, well, well.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.351
If it isn't the man
who couldn't help me at all.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.353
I'm here because
I've developed a new technique

16:46.353 --> 16:48.572
that might restore
your ability to walk.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.226
- A new technique, you say?
- Yes.

16:50.226 --> 16:53.664
The idea is I fuse the L3
a little higher over here,

16:53.664 --> 16:55.231
and a little lower
over here.

16:55.231 --> 16:56.667
Of course.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.234
Sounds groundbreaking.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.062
Now tell me, Doc,
have you had a chance

17:00.062 --> 17:02.064
to patent
this technique of yours?

17:02.064 --> 17:05.241
I was gonna swing by the patent
office right after I told you.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.590
Oh, really?

17:06.590 --> 17:08.462
Excuse me, I have to
go flip somewhere.

17:08.462 --> 17:09.985
I'll be right back.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.249
Oh, no, you don't!

17:17.688 --> 17:19.777
Whoa, whoa. Whee!

17:33.835 --> 17:36.098
Okay, okay, we'll take a break
from <i>Big Bang.</i>

17:36.098 --> 17:37.273
What do you wanna watch?

17:37.273 --> 17:38.970
<i>Shark Tank.</i>

17:38.970 --> 17:40.450
Whoa.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.799
<i>Hi, Sharks.</i>

17:41.799 --> 17:43.497
I'm Steven Anita Smith,

17:43.497 --> 17:46.543
and this is my business partner,
Toshi Yoshida.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.024
And, boy, do we have
something special for you.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.156
Toshi?

17:52.027 --> 17:53.463
Looks kinda big.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.423
I know what you're thinking, Sharks.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.512
This is just a drawing
of a bowtie.

17:58.512 --> 18:02.559
Well... imagine if this drawing
was an actual bowtie

18:02.559 --> 18:06.694
and that it was about the size
of a fun-size Snickers bar.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.088
- Well, that's smaller.
- Now...

18:09.088 --> 18:13.135
in your brains,
imagine that fun-size bowtie...

18:13.135 --> 18:14.832
is on a baby!

18:14.832 --> 18:17.357
Oh, my God. That's fantastic!

18:18.271 --> 18:20.186
Lucky kids.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.013
You should have come up
with that idea.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.669
Oh, free lawn chair.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.454
Our luck's changing!

18:27.454 --> 18:28.890
Oh, no, Khaleesi!

18:28.890 --> 18:30.935
Our luck's changing back!

18:35.114 --> 18:36.941
Wait,
you're here too?

18:36.941 --> 18:38.465
I guess when it comes
to kidnapping,

18:38.465 --> 18:40.031
I'm your second choice.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.120
You know what?
I'm just gonna leave.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.338
I don't feel special anymore.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.514
Shut up!
You're both gonna pay!

18:44.514 --> 18:47.343
Okay, you sound... angry.

18:47.343 --> 18:48.823
I get that.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.826
You got locked up
for three months because of him.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.175
But why am I here?

18:53.175 --> 18:54.959
You started
this whole thing

18:54.959 --> 18:57.658
by making me blow up
my dad's speakers!

18:57.658 --> 19:00.574
I just wanted
a quiet night-in with canapes!

19:00.574 --> 19:02.358
Hey, I said it right!

19:02.358 --> 19:04.882
Maybe to celebrate,
you should let us go?

19:04.882 --> 19:07.189
I'm up for a celebration.
Grab a bite.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.365
- Ever been to Bubba Gump's?
- Shut up!

19:09.365 --> 19:11.759
I guess
he doesn't like shrimp.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.545
Barry,
what are you doing?

19:15.545 --> 19:18.200
I'm gonna blow out
your eardrums

19:18.200 --> 19:21.247
like you made me blow out
my dad's speakers!

19:21.247 --> 19:22.770
Kewl.

19:32.693 --> 19:34.956
Please, Barry!

19:34.956 --> 19:36.871
Don't do this!

19:41.571 --> 19:43.573
If you're gonna
blow out our eardrums,

19:43.573 --> 19:45.923
could you at least
adjust the EQ?

19:45.923 --> 19:48.752
John Rutsey's drums
aren't even coming through!

19:53.061 --> 19:56.064
Gonna have to go louder for me.
I don't have ears!

19:56.064 --> 19:57.239
Look!

19:57.239 --> 19:58.632
No, look closer!

19:58.632 --> 20:00.982
Classic headphones bite!
Myah!

20:12.994 --> 20:17.259
Listen, I'm sorry we pushed you
around all these years!

20:17.259 --> 20:18.478
It's not right!

20:18.478 --> 20:20.784
I can't tell
what you're saying,

20:20.784 --> 20:23.265
but I wanna tell you
I'm sorry!

20:23.265 --> 20:26.137
I shouldn't have kidnapped
and tortured you!

20:26.137 --> 20:27.443
- What?
- What?

20:27.443 --> 20:29.619
Speak up,
I can't hear you!

20:29.619 --> 20:32.274
Louder!
What are you saying?!

20:32.274 --> 20:34.145
I see
your mouth is moving,

20:34.145 --> 20:35.799
but I don't hear anything!

20:35.799 --> 20:37.105
I really just don't have

20:37.105 --> 20:38.976
any idea
what you're saying!

20:38.976 --> 20:40.978
[muffled] Are you
saying you're sorry?

20:40.978 --> 20:42.980
I hope you're saying
you're sorry!

20:42.980 --> 20:45.156
Doing what
with who now?

20:45.156 --> 20:47.637
Quiet down there,
I got sleeping babies!

20:47.637 --> 20:48.943
What a cutie.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.814
Let's see here.
What's your name?

20:50.814 --> 20:52.642
Billy? Hmm.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.514
Mind if I call you Wrobel?

20:56.516 --> 20:57.560
Have a great night!
