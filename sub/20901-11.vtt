14:14.437 --> 14:17.566
-Drive faster!
-Why, man? Why did you do it?

14:20.277 --> 14:21.278
Get down!

14:24.698 --> 14:26.324
No, Daniel! No!

14:41.006 --> 14:44.342
-Help me.
-Relax, fatso. It barely grazed you.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.847
They shot first.
Look what they did to Everardo.

14:48.972 --> 14:52.225
They were defending themselves.
You shot first. I saw it!

14:52.350 --> 14:54.227
They were armed and starting to riot.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.229
I had no choice. I had to act.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.609
You can say whatever you want.
Lola will hear the truth.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.366
Hurry, hurry!

15:30.263 --> 15:32.599
Son of a bitch.

18:17.514 --> 18:20.183
We don't need anything.
Their problems are their own.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.311
Take them.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.180
Do these people know
where your daughter is?

19:42.599 --> 19:43.600
Yes.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.438
They say she lives with them...

19:49.272 --> 19:50.398
...at their camp.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.531
Do you believe them?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.533
Madison has never lied to me.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.791
I understand
if you must go to your daughter,

20:08.917 --> 20:10.960
but I need to know now.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.547
Lola...

20:17.717 --> 20:19.010
...my daughter is safe...

20:20.136 --> 20:21.179
...but you're not.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.269
I made a promise...

20:29.312 --> 20:30.772
...and I'm going to fulfill it.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.193
I'll stay. I'm going to help you.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.203
Ofelia thinks I'm dead.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.458
Maybe it's for the best.

23:55.268 --> 23:58.229
You must keep this clean.
If you don't, it will get infected.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.493
A flesh wound.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.163
Lucky for me, I have a lot of flesh.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.645
Shut up.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.273
Don't you remember
what Daniel calls this man?

24:42.398 --> 24:43.441
The snake.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.251
It's been weeks
since they've had water.

31:19.587 --> 31:22.131
Remember why we haven't gone back
to that neighborhood?

31:23.257 --> 31:24.925
Last time we went, they attacked us.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.136
That's why it's so important
we go back -

31:27.261 --> 31:29.179
so they don't
feel the need to attack.

31:29.305 --> 31:32.474
Next week there will be another
neighborhood, another attack.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.768
This isn't sustainable, Lola.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.021
I know they are hungry and thirsty...

31:37.813 --> 31:40.357
...but one day
they will see the good that we do.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.985
Maybe, some of them.

31:43.861 --> 31:45.571
There will always be unhappy ones.

31:46.322 --> 31:49.158
And they will be the ones
who come looking for us - for you.

31:49.617 --> 31:52.202
Without weapons and ammunition,

31:52.328 --> 31:53.495
I can't defend you.

31:54.038 --> 31:56.332
-You would have me become a killer.
-No.

31:56.457 --> 31:58.000
-Like Dante.
-Lola.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.001
Like you.

32:00.794 --> 32:03.297
I have killed - killed for you.

32:03.964 --> 32:07.092
I would do it again
to guard you soul,

32:07.217 --> 32:08.427
to guard your life.

32:12.222 --> 32:14.600
EfraÃ­n says the people fear you.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.145
You kill without provocation.
Is that true?

32:18.771 --> 32:19.897
That's a lie.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.817
I will see for myself today
on the water run.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.362
And if they do fear me,
that's a good thing.

32:27.655 --> 32:30.783
I know about these things.
First, they hit us in the streets.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.993
Then they come to our house.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.787
They come in, they drag us out,

32:34.912 --> 32:37.873
and they hang us from the dam walls.

32:47.383 --> 32:49.593
If you don't believe
in what I'm doing...

32:50.427 --> 32:51.595
...you should leave.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.724
But if you stay, do what I ask.

33:01.939 --> 33:04.608
We are on schedule
for the water run this afternoon.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.262
Down with the Water Queen.

34:16.513 --> 34:18.891
Down with the Water Queen.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.463
We must make sure
the dead don't enter.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.756
We can kill the dead,

37:37.881 --> 37:40.884
but the living will just keep coming
like I said they would.

37:41.009 --> 37:43.136
-It could have been an accident.
-It wasn't.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.638
What do you know?

37:47.057 --> 37:49.267
Can you hear?
"Down with the Water Queen."

37:50.644 --> 37:53.355
They are testing us,
to see how we respond.

37:54.523 --> 37:56.066
And the next attack will be worse.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.152
Take them to my office.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.488
Hurry up with the fence!

38:01.822 --> 38:02.823
Hurry!

38:25.095 --> 38:26.138
How many?

38:26.722 --> 38:29.850
How many guns?
How much ammo do we need?

38:29.975 --> 38:33.145
No, violence will consume you.

38:33.270 --> 38:35.230
Please don't make this deal
with the devil.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.775
Release the water
and return it to the people.

38:38.900 --> 38:42.070
The people will still get the water
and the dam will be protected.

38:42.738 --> 38:44.072
This is the best solution.
