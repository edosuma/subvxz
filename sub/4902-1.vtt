01:59.600 --> 02:01.520
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.440
Let go! Let go! Stop!

02:04.400 --> 02:06.680
Damn. Richard Ellespeare died.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.759
- He was a professor of mine at Harvard.
- No!

02:10.160 --> 02:13.485
- He was a novelist, humanitarian.
- Hey, hey, back there.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.360
- Published eight novels, including the best seller...
- Stop it! Quit it!

02:17.395 --> 02:19.245
Hope's Way, for which
he won the Pulitzer Prize.

02:19.280 --> 02:23.520
- What kind of man was this?
- A man who pursues excellence and nothing less.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.200
- Dad?
- Yes?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.720
I have to go to the bathroom.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.880
Can't you hold it
till we get there?

02:33.200 --> 02:35.080
Mmm, yes. I guess...

02:36.080 --> 02:38.120
I can practice
mind over matter.

02:38.155 --> 02:39.600
Atta girl.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.200
Oh, look at
the baby cows, Ellie!

02:46.640 --> 02:48.760
Oh, my God!
Look at them.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.840
I'm reading, Mom.
And baby cows are calves.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.160
I was never close
to my mother growing up.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.400
Is that something Mr. Best
is going to use against me?

03:03.920 --> 03:07.280
Ellen, the D.A.'s not going
to use anything against you.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.760
Mrs. Best, his wife,
was a friend of my mother's.

03:14.480 --> 03:16.365
Do I need an attorney?

03:16.400 --> 03:19.520
Nobody in this office
is accusing you of anything.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.880
We're well aware that
this kind of thing happens...

03:24.080 --> 03:26.640
all the time
with terminal patients.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.600
It's... It's a small town.
People talk.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.240
The D.A. wants to be able to say
that he looked into it...

03:32.275 --> 03:34.320
and he can put it to bed.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.760
What can I say?
It's an election year.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.880
Anyway, were you aware that an autopsy
was being performed on your mother's body?

03:40.915 --> 03:43.080
Yes, uh-huh, at her request.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.360
Uh, actually to find out
the source of the disease.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.640
Primarily for my benefit.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.520
Mm-hmm.
Where are you living now?

03:54.800 --> 03:58.080
In New York. I've been there
since I finished Harvard.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.845
This living in the suburbs
is going to kill me.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.240
Hey, Tweedy, the Bearstone Ladies
predict a stock market crash next month.

04:20.274 --> 04:22.417
- Finish the captions on the junk shot, Casey.
- They're antiques.

04:22.452 --> 04:24.560
- I've got a 110 pulse. I've got to check this again.
- Tweedy.

04:24.595 --> 04:26.560
This story is too good.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.840
Senator Sullivan, youngest guy
ever to be elected to the Senate.

04:29.875 --> 04:32.720
His father was a drug dealer,
he overcomes that... excuse me...

04:32.755 --> 04:35.565
is on his way to big things,
possibly the presidency...

04:35.600 --> 04:39.440
- until he crashes his car into a tree, kills everyone inside...
- That was actually final draft?

04:39.475 --> 04:41.325
while he's on cocaine.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.245
I mean, this is not just good.
This is great.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.645
Shakespearean. Sins of the father
revisited on the son...

04:45.680 --> 04:47.600
- etcetera, etcetera.
- We've got no interview. He's not talking.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.520
- I can get him to talk. I promise you.
- He's checking into rehab.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.440
Some people in town
are describing you as...

04:51.475 --> 04:53.360
cold and insensitive.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.560
Um...

04:56.720 --> 04:59.240
Ambition is Ellen Gulden's religion.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.600
- She's condescending. She's remote, whatever.
- I can get him to talk.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.880
Well, I was ambitious.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.320
I still am.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.040
My father taught me to work very hard
at everything I do, and I always have.

05:13.075 --> 05:14.680
I'm not tired.

05:16.880 --> 05:20.600
- So you were living a pretty
normal life in New York? - Uh-huh.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.085
- Apartment?
- Uh-huh.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.440
- Roommate?
- No. No roommate.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.120
- Boyfriend?
- Boyfriend.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.720
- Honey, please let me explain.
- Jordan, just get out of here.

05:32.755 --> 05:34.605
- I don't want to see you anymore.
- Come on. I got...

05:34.640 --> 05:36.560
I'm standing out here. I got wine,
candles. I got the whole kit.

05:36.595 --> 05:38.445
Just go away, Jordan.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.880
El, can I just talk to you for five
minutes, please? I'll explain everything.

05:40.915 --> 05:42.817
- Go away!
- We were together...

05:42.852 --> 05:44.986
since senior year in college.

05:45.021 --> 05:47.120
This one was the last time, okay?

05:47.240 --> 05:50.120
Well, not together.
We, uh... We took breaks.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.600
You know, a lot of breaks.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.600
That's mean. That's not funny.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.800
- He just needed some space.
- Space named Linda.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.120
I'm sorry. Was that her name?
Lori? I don't remember.

06:02.155 --> 06:04.717
- Oh, you're so mean.
- Is that not her name?

06:04.752 --> 06:07.280
- That... You're so mean.
- Don't get me wrong.

06:07.315 --> 06:08.800
I like him.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.200
Of course, it was, um,
Jules, my best girlfriend...

06:16.400 --> 06:19.960
who, uh, came home with me
to celebrate my father's birthday.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.800
Jordan, um, as usual,
had something he had to do.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.680
Oh, this ought to be good.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.880
"Come as your favorite literary
character". I don't know why...

06:28.915 --> 06:31.760
my mom can't just throw
a normal birthday party.

06:31.795 --> 06:34.400
Ellie, it's going to be perfectly fine.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.800
Thank you. Thanks.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.720
- Hey!
- Whoo-hoo!

06:43.280 --> 06:44.840
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.080
- Oh, good hat. Uh-huh. - Really
good hat. Really good everything.

06:48.115 --> 06:50.000
Thanks. What'd you guys
come dressed as?

06:50.035 --> 06:51.885
The Sylvia Plath twins?

06:51.920 --> 06:54.320
- Brian, you know I can't do costumes.
- Why?

06:54.355 --> 06:56.680
- It's just so... Mom.
- Human?

06:56.720 --> 06:58.880
- So what have you guys been up to?
- God!

06:58.915 --> 07:01.040
- Ooh. Mm-hmm.
- It's writing and deadlines.

07:01.075 --> 07:02.640
Take me away.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.840
- Okay.
- Oh, wait!

07:04.880 --> 07:07.760
Somebody just finished summer school,
didn't he? Congratulations!

07:07.795 --> 07:10.160
- Actually, I didn't finish.
- That's great!

07:10.195 --> 07:11.440
What?

07:13.040 --> 07:14.840
I, Brian Gulden...

07:15.440 --> 07:19.640
son of Mr. American Literature and the
romantics, failed American Literature.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.360
You're serious?

07:23.600 --> 07:25.760
- Yeah.
- Well, way to go.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.960
- How did you do that?
- I blew the test, Ellen.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.520
Brian.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.320
Did you tell Dad?

07:38.480 --> 07:39.680
No.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.920
Just 'cause I'm failing
doesn't make me a moron.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.800
Yoo-hoo! Hi!

07:46.640 --> 07:48.525
- There she is.
- Hi, Mom.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.480
Your dad's not here.
The coast is clear. Gimme! Gimme!

07:50.515 --> 07:52.280
Gimme!
Hi, Jules.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.080
Hi.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.645
- Hi. You too.
- Good to see you.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.565
- Let me get your...
- Oh, no, no, no. I got it.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.480
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Oh, thank you.

08:02.515 --> 08:04.360
- Wow.
- Thank you.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.720
You got a cab? I would have sent
Brian to come and pick you up.

08:08.755 --> 08:11.120
- You should have told me.
- Oh, that's okay.

08:11.155 --> 08:13.005
Come in. Come in,
come in, come in.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.920
- God, this must have taken you days.
- Oh, well, yes.

08:15.955 --> 08:18.377
- Jules, you look wonderful.
- Oh, thanks.

08:18.412 --> 08:20.800
- I just cut my hair.
- Oh. It looks gorgeous.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.600
- And your hair looks great too.
- Oh, thank you.

08:23.635 --> 08:26.440
Oh, this... It's yarn.
Look. Guess who I am.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.360
Hmm? Oh!

08:28.880 --> 08:30.560
Oh, wait! Clue.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.880
- Oh... If I only had a brain
- A heart

08:36.080 --> 08:38.200
A brain
and whatever else

08:38.480 --> 08:40.845
Oh, well.
You're right, as usual.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.480
- So, let me see. Who are you?
- Uh...

08:45.680 --> 08:50.000
- Don't tell me. Let me guess. - Actually,
you know what? We-We kind of forgot.

08:50.035 --> 08:52.837
But is was only because
we were trying to hurry...

08:52.872 --> 08:55.640
'cause, of course, we wanted
to be here on time, so...

08:56.240 --> 08:58.760
- God, that cake looks so good. So, we're just us.
- Oh.

08:58.795 --> 09:01.520
That's okay.
That's okay, Ellie. That's...

09:02.000 --> 09:04.080
Ooh!
But I have an idea.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.200
I do have a Thanksgiving
costume upstairs.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.680
- That's okay.
- I could whip something up for you. It's a turkey!

09:09.715 --> 09:12.200
- No, really. It's okay. It's all right.
- It's really...

09:12.235 --> 09:13.965
- Can I help you with anything?
- Oh, yes, thanks.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.880
- You could take those dishes, put them in the buffet. Umm...
- Sure.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.120
And Ellie... Ellie?

09:21.200 --> 09:24.160
You can... keep-keep, uh,
slicing the bread...

09:25.520 --> 09:28.120
- with this knife, okay?
- Thank you.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.080
I read your piece
on Geraldine Ferraro.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.760
My brilliant daughter.

09:33.795 --> 09:35.760
I was so... proud of you.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.560
It's no big deal.
It's just a little follow-up piece.

09:39.595 --> 09:41.720
Back and forth.
Saw on it.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.840
- Do you think that Dad read it?
- Oh, I'm sure he did.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.400
You know your dad.
But he doesn't talk shop with me.

09:49.640 --> 09:50.920
Fuck.

09:52.880 --> 09:55.280
Nope. It's okay. It's okay.
It's not even bleeding.

09:55.315 --> 09:57.645
- It's fine. It's really fine.
- Wrap it up.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.200
- Okay. Thank you.
- Brown paper. There's something in it that stops the bleeding.

10:00.235 --> 10:03.200
- Did you know that? -
Really? - Okay, thanks.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.520
- Oh! Oh, dear.
- Sorry.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.165
- No, I'll get it.
- That's all right. Don't throw the pieces out...

10:09.200 --> 10:11.600
- because I'm going to use it in my mosaic table I'm making.
- Don't worry.

10:11.635 --> 10:14.960
- We got it.
- Keep your finger up and wrapped in the bag.

10:14.995 --> 10:17.440
Hello?
There's no place like home.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.640
- Thank God.
- Are we the first ones here?

10:20.720 --> 10:23.600
- Ellen! Oh, it's good to see you.
- Oh, yeah.

10:23.635 --> 10:25.485
- You're lookin' tired.
- Ellen.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.240
- Now, who are you supposed to be? Who?
- Oh, I'm Lizzie Borden.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.760
You know, Lizzie Borden:
"Took an axe...

10:31.795 --> 10:33.960
gave her mother 40 whacks.,,

10:37.520 --> 10:40.400
- Help! Ellen, I just saw Dad. He just turned the corner.
- Oh! Hey!

10:40.435 --> 10:42.320
Jules! Jules!
Come help. Come help.

10:42.355 --> 10:43.600
Okay.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.400
- So, um, Snow White, explain. What was that?
- Oh.

10:48.560 --> 10:51.720
Mrs. Best, the D.A.'s wife,
she's in my mom's cult.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.680
The Minnies, yeah.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.685
They're named after
some local do-gooder...

10:56.720 --> 11:00.080
who used to decorate Christmas trees
in the town square.

11:00.115 --> 11:02.445
- And, um, they're a cult?
- Woman's group.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.360
- Right. Right.
- You know, bake sales, tag sales, all of that.

11:05.395 --> 11:07.245
- Come on. You be nice.
- Do-good stuff.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.200
- No. Hi.
- You must be Ellen. I'm Harold Simpkey.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.120
- I teach music over...
- Harold, could you, um...

11:11.155 --> 11:13.440
He's here!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

11:13.520 --> 11:15.440
Hurry up! Here he is.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.980
Everybody, get-get-get down!

11:18.015 --> 11:20.040
Shh! Ralph, move your... Shh!

11:28.400 --> 11:29.720
Quiet!

11:32.720 --> 11:34.000
Kate?

11:38.480 --> 11:39.760
Kate?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.280
- Kate?
- Surprise!

11:47.240 --> 11:48.920
Happy birthday!

11:52.400 --> 11:54.400
No. Look at all of you.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.000
Kate.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.960
How did you pull this off?
Bravo!

12:02.995 --> 12:04.880
Come on, Dad, speech.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.520
Speech! Speech!

12:13.520 --> 12:16.400
I'm quite out of breath with walking
home. It's only in going uphill...

12:16.435 --> 12:19.120
that you realize
you're headed downhill.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.960
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you all for coming.

12:26.995 --> 12:29.560
I'm really...
I'm really very touched.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.600
I'm very touched.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.240
So, I guess this is the...

12:39.560 --> 12:41.720
last class of the semester.

12:43.760 --> 12:47.120
Thank you for taking this journey
with me. It's been a lot of fun.

12:47.155 --> 12:49.160
And have a great summer.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.960
There it is.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.840
The National Book Award.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.880
Oh, wow. He knows Oliver Most.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.320
Yeah, they went to Harvard together.

13:30.355 --> 13:32.400
Come see this. Come here.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.400
It's his novel, Comeback Inn.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.480
He's been working on it for years.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.720
Took Milton ten
to finish my favorite poem.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.600
Oh, here's his collected essays.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.040
I read this first chapter.

13:49.075 --> 13:50.840
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.200
And?

13:54.320 --> 13:56.360
- It's great.
- Uh-huh.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.520
So, uh, what-what'd he say
about your article?

14:07.760 --> 14:09.760
Oh, I don't believe it.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.360
You didn't ask him, did you?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.040
Ellie. Tsk.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.140
- That's what they called me.
- Did they now?

14:18.175 --> 14:20.325
You know,
having the dubious distinction...

14:20.360 --> 14:23.600
of having been called "Big Al"
when you were this diminutive...

14:23.635 --> 14:26.280
package is a challenge
to confidence...

14:27.440 --> 14:29.805
but you have obviously
survived it, have you not?

14:29.840 --> 14:33.440
- Yes.
- So here you have in front of you a living example...

14:33.680 --> 14:36.480
of-of everything
you're trying to achieve.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.440
I would just say get an ice breaker
and break out of it.

14:39.475 --> 14:41.325
- I'm havin' a lot of trouble.
- Listen...

14:41.360 --> 14:45.200
a writer calls his friend, he says,
"I've just finished writing a story.

14:45.235 --> 14:47.565
"It's not very good.
In fact, it's terrible.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.965
The worst part of it is
it's the best I can do.,,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.440
The writer is John Steinbeck.
The book is Grapes of Wrath!

14:56.240 --> 14:58.160
- Hi! Hi.
- Hey! Hi.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.320
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

15:04.880 --> 15:07.245
I'm afraid with 55
staring at me in the face...

15:07.280 --> 15:09.680
I'm developing inflammation
of the sentence structure...

15:09.715 --> 15:12.760
and a definite hardening
of the paragraphs, but...

15:13.520 --> 15:16.120
- How are you?
- Oh, no. How are you?

15:16.880 --> 15:19.400
You knew all about
this little thing, didn't you?

15:19.435 --> 15:21.680
- Huh?
- No, actually, I didn't.

15:21.715 --> 15:22.920
Hmm.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.920
Well, did you get a chance
to look at my latest piece?

15:27.955 --> 15:29.800
Yes. Yes, of course.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.640
The Minnies seem to get
their literature from Disney.

15:34.675 --> 15:36.000
I know.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.925
- Hey!
- Oh, my God, they're everywhere.

15:38.960 --> 15:42.200
Enemy forces at 2:00.
Danger, Will Robertson. Danger.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.560
- It's Robinson. Robinson.
- Oh, Robinson.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.400
Safe.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.880
Safe for the moment.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.680
That was better. That was better.
Now I'll show you...

15:57.715 --> 15:59.560
About your article...

15:59.600 --> 16:01.760
- Hmm.
- I don't want to interfere, you know.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.885
- You are doing just fine.
- Oh, no. Come on.

16:03.920 --> 16:07.200
Come on. You know your criticism,
it helps me so much.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.280
I really appreciate it.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.080
All right.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.280
Writer to writer.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.320
- Less is more.
- Hmm.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.240
Your approach is a little
overemotional at times.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.320
It needs to be more succinct. The word
choice needs to be more muscular.

16:30.355 --> 16:33.200
Ellen, you've got a great talent,
but it's not enough.

16:33.235 --> 16:35.085
You have to reach, goddamn it.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.280
When I was 20 years old
working at the New Yorker...

16:37.315 --> 16:39.440
I would spend a whole day
working on one sentence.

16:39.475 --> 16:41.640
I mean, Lord knows I could...

16:46.640 --> 16:49.760
Wait a minute.
It's your best work to date. It's...

16:51.440 --> 16:55.240
It's not your fault. It's like
the problem is that editor, damn it.

16:56.240 --> 16:59.200
- What is his name? Uh, Tw... Twimpy?
- Tweedy.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.880
Yeah.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.440
- George? Well, see ya.
- He's a fool as far as...

17:03.475 --> 17:05.325
- Hey.
- Yeah? We're hiding.

17:05.359 --> 17:09.200
I know. Come inside. It's time to
blow out the candles and make a wish!

17:09.234 --> 17:11.400
Oh, I wish we were... alone.

17:12.079 --> 17:15.720
Well, we're not yet. So hurry up.
Come on. Everybody's waiting.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.000
Man, that's solid.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.520
Brian, how's Harvard treating ya?

17:26.960 --> 17:30.120
Can't complain.
We beat Oxford in the Prentice Cup.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.720
I was referring
to your courses.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.880
Summer school was all right?

17:36.080 --> 17:37.520
Uh, fine.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.520
Yeah? You didn't have
any more problems, did ya?

17:41.840 --> 17:43.845
Nope.
Everything's fine, Dad.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.125
I'd be glad to help
by talking to your professors.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.640
- I'd be glad to look at your...
- I said everything's fine.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.960
Well, good.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.040
Good.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.800
- He's had a few, huh?
- It's his birthday.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.365
Good night!
Good night, Mary!

18:10.400 --> 18:12.360
- Good night, guys.
- Good night... What's his name?

18:12.395 --> 18:13.680
Hewitt.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.360
Hewitt. That's...

18:21.960 --> 18:25.160
Don't do anything.
I'll do it in the morning, honey.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.280
Well, thank you,
thank you one and all for a...

18:30.120 --> 18:32.005
a beautiful birthday.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.760
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Dad.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.080
Happy birthday, darling.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.800
- Good night. Uh-huh.
- Good night?

18:41.160 --> 18:44.040
You're not going to bed.
You're not going to sleep, anyway.

18:44.075 --> 18:46.920
- Oh, God.
- I have to get up early, you know.

18:46.955 --> 18:48.840
I have Dr. Cohn in the morning.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.080
Shh!

18:52.680 --> 18:54.920
Oh, do you like Bette Midler?

18:55.080 --> 18:56.480
Oh! You.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.680
Come on. Come on.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.240
Just one.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.080
I don't care about that.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.720
I knew my mother was going
to the doctor, but, uh...

20:15.755 --> 20:18.040
I didn't really know
what for.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.320
So you didn't ask.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.560
No.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.640
What poem begins,
"'Twas the night before Christmas"?

20:29.675 --> 20:32.485
Uh, it's not called,
"'Twas the night before Christmas".

20:32.520 --> 20:34.920
It's called, uh... I can recite
the whole thing. Does that count?

20:34.955 --> 20:36.960
Anybody need any coffee?

20:37.320 --> 20:39.685
- We just need the title. No, thank you.
- No? Okay.

20:39.720 --> 20:42.600
- I'm gonna go through the whole thing.
- Don't let him cheat!

20:42.635 --> 20:43.960
Please!

20:47.400 --> 20:49.800
Oh, my God.
"A Visit from St. Nick".

20:49.835 --> 20:52.120
Oh, man! Don't I get the point?

20:52.680 --> 20:53.920
Hey!

21:02.280 --> 21:05.520
- Where's Mom?
- They're going to keep her overnight.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.520
She's going to have to have surgery.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.200
Surgery?

21:17.640 --> 21:20.800
Yes, they're...
They're going to try to take it out.

21:24.360 --> 21:25.920
It's cancer?

21:35.880 --> 21:39.560
- Are they sure?
- I'm going back out there to spend the night.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.000
Is she going to die?

21:44.040 --> 21:46.200
No, she's not going to die.

21:47.880 --> 21:51.400
After the operation, she may need
radiation or chemotherapy.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.525
The doctor said that
that can be very debilitating...

21:55.560 --> 21:59.600
in which case she would need somebody
to take care of her during the day.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.440
Actually, I...

22:05.160 --> 22:07.080
I want you to-to move home...

22:07.115 --> 22:08.960
to take care of her.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.920
Move home?

22:12.360 --> 22:15.360
- Brian is at school.
- Dad, what about my job?

22:17.160 --> 22:19.640
Well, you can
freelance from here.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.760
She's going to need help
during the day.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.240
Well...

22:24.840 --> 22:27.240
Maybe you could take sabbatical.
I mean, it's been four years since...

22:27.275 --> 22:29.640
- you took one for the novel.
- A sabbatical is out of the question.

22:29.675 --> 22:32.485
I have a department to run,
and I have to make a living.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.880
As you well know, the advance
on my novel was spent years ago...

22:35.915 --> 22:37.765
on yours and Brian's education.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.320
Dad, I have to do my interviews
and my research in New York.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.280
I may never catch up again.
It could ruin my career.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.205
- We can get a nurse and I will come home every weekend.
- A nurse?

22:51.240 --> 22:55.080
We're not getting a nurse. Your mother
didn't get a nurse when you had chicken pox.

22:55.115 --> 22:58.920
A nurse. You know she won't tolerate
having strangers in this house.

22:58.955 --> 23:02.297
- But, Dad...
- Your mother needs you, Ellen. Jesus Christ!

23:02.332 --> 23:05.640
You've got a Harvard education,
but where is your heart?

23:11.880 --> 23:13.360
Excuse me.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.440
- Honey? Hi.
- Hey.

23:21.960 --> 23:25.000
- So sorry I'm late. Sorry. Hey, Jules.
- Hi. Bye.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.560
- Okay. Hi. Mmm, kiss.
- Hi.

23:31.080 --> 23:32.520
You okay?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.885
Here, give me your bag.

23:34.920 --> 23:38.040
- What's the matter? She's what?
- My mom is sick.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.085
Ellen, a sick mother means
three weeks off...

23:42.120 --> 23:44.520
and a very nice arrangement
of flowers sent by the staff.

23:44.555 --> 23:46.885
Yeah, still holding.
You're doing great here.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.320
If you leave there's no guarantee. All
I could offer you is some freelance work.

23:49.355 --> 23:53.040
Okay, but I'm still going to finish
the Sullivan piece from home.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.880
How are you going to do that?

23:57.480 --> 24:00.360
- Actually, Casey said that he has a way into Sullivan too.
- No.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.680
This is my piece.
I can do it.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.640
Okay. I know what this is about.

24:05.675 --> 24:07.520
You want an upgrade.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.960
Well, you got it.
I don't know what it is yet...

24:09.995 --> 24:11.640
but it's yours.

24:14.280 --> 24:17.100
You really think that
someone would come in here...

24:17.135 --> 24:19.920
and say that their mother
has cancer for a promotion?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.040
Ellen, this is New York.

24:39.720 --> 24:41.320
Ellen Gulden.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.840
Hello, sweetheart. It's Dad.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.440
Hi, Dad.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.240
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.200
- Listen, I'm really sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.445
Don't forget
to make an extra set of keys...

24:57.480 --> 24:59.880
- in case you need to get in.
- I know. I know. You know what I need to do?

24:59.915 --> 25:01.800
- I've got to disconnect the phone.
- Yes, by Wednesday.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.685
- By Wednesday.
- Okay. I'll call then.

25:03.720 --> 25:06.565
- When is she moving in? Saturday?
- Thursday.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.860
- Okay. What are you gonna do?
- Call you when I get there.

25:09.895 --> 25:13.120
- You always forget, then I worry.
- I won't forget. I promise.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.840
Thanks. Okay.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.160
Sweetie, I'm all nervous.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.720
I've never asked anybody
to live with me.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.840
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.640
Ellie?

26:30.240 --> 26:32.320
- You're home!
- Mm-hmm.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.560
I was just... I was remembering when
I moved these plates from Princeton.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.360
- Oh, yeah.
- Remember? And Brian was practicing juggling.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.120
- So, how are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

26:45.155 --> 26:47.005
- Good.
- I just have to take it easy.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.440
My oncologist, who is...
you'll love this...

26:49.475 --> 26:51.840
a woman,
says no upholstering...

26:52.320 --> 26:54.400
no furniture refinishing.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.160
Oh, no. What are you gonna do?

26:57.195 --> 26:59.480
Can you stay
the whole weekend?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.400
Uh, didn't Dad...
Oh, he didn't...

27:05.760 --> 27:08.120
Well, um,
I'm home for a while.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.920
I took some time off from work.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.440
Home where? Here?
Well, what about your job...

27:15.840 --> 27:18.000
and your little apartment
and everything?

27:18.035 --> 27:20.297
Well, I'm gonna work
from here, so...

27:20.332 --> 27:22.525
- Oh, don't worry about it.
- Oh, no.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.480
- Tweedy said that it's fine.
- Oh, no, no, no.

27:24.515 --> 27:26.365
Not to play nursemaid to me.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.765
- Oh, no. That's not...
- Oh, I don't need...

27:28.800 --> 27:31.320
Man, you'll hate me.
I'll just make you some dinner.

27:31.355 --> 27:33.085
No, I want to stay.

27:33.120 --> 27:35.440
At least until you feel better.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.760
I mean, it's the right thing.

27:39.360 --> 27:40.760
For who?

27:41.760 --> 27:44.080
- Whose idea was this?
- Mine.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.605
Dad, and...
Well, it was both of ours.

27:47.640 --> 27:51.360
He shouldn't have asked you to do this,
honey, because he knows you.

27:51.395 --> 27:54.240
- He knows this will never work.
- No. Now, I told Dad...

27:54.275 --> 27:56.640
that I want to do this
and I'm going to.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.680
So, that's final.
Okay?

28:01.920 --> 28:03.440
Okay. Okay.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.040
Okay. Oh, my girl.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.280
I'm gonna make you
some cinnamon toast.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.360
And I'll get you
a cup of tea too.

28:15.395 --> 28:16.640
Okay.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.480
I'm glad you're home. Thanks.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.965
She didn't know I was coming.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.400
Well, you know how
your mother is.

28:38.435 --> 28:40.160
If she'd known...

28:40.320 --> 28:43.600
she probably would've redecorated
your entire bedroom.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.440
What's that smell?

28:47.040 --> 28:49.520
Um, that is
an old writer's trick.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.440
Schiller believed that
his body sabotaged...

28:55.475 --> 28:58.080
the attention of his mind
while he was writing.

28:58.115 --> 28:59.965
So, he engaged his body...

29:00.000 --> 29:02.440
with a simple stimulant, apples...

29:03.840 --> 29:05.600
to free his mind.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.720
So far, all it's done for me is
make me hungry for apple pie Ã  la mode.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.960
So, what have you been
working on recently?

29:12.995 --> 29:15.317
My interview with James Sullivan.

29:15.352 --> 29:17.640
- Senator Sullivan?
- Mm-hmm.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.360
That's impressive.
That's a big story.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.760
You know, I've been
meaning to ask you.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.800
Random House has been asking me
who I'd like to write...

29:27.835 --> 29:30.640
the introduction to Volume Two
of my Collected Essays.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.920
It's coming out in the spring.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.440
Feel free to say no,
but if you had the time...

29:37.475 --> 29:39.360
how would you feel
about writing the introduction?

29:39.395 --> 29:41.600
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.800
- I would love to.
- Great. Great.

29:48.480 --> 29:52.000
They envision some biographical sketch
or interview perhaps.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.680
- I'll help you write the questions, if you want.
- Okay.

29:55.715 --> 29:58.080
Here's some literary criticism...

29:58.560 --> 30:00.445
in case you haven't
seen any of that recently.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.360
And two, three examples of my work
in case you don't carry that...

30:03.395 --> 30:05.280
around in your bags
with you wherever you go.

30:05.315 --> 30:06.760
And, wait.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.760
Wow.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.120
Could you wash these for me?
No starch.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.400
And this pocket
needs to be stitched.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.400
Thanks for taking care of this.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.520
Ellie!
Tell Dad dinner's on the table.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.600
Sweetie, later on tonight,
I'm gonna run you a vanilla bath.

30:33.635 --> 30:36.120
That'll help you
go to sleep. Okay?

30:47.520 --> 30:49.680
- Morning.
- Good morning.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.080
Good morning
Mary sunshine

30:52.320 --> 30:54.200
Did you wake so soon

30:55.200 --> 30:58.180
- Remember when we used to sing you that?
- Nope.

30:58.215 --> 31:01.160
I see the decorating season
has officially begun.

31:01.440 --> 31:04.120
- Our quarterback is suiting up.
- Mmm.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.165
Oh, George.
You love it when...

31:07.200 --> 31:09.960
the Minnies decorate
the Christmas trees.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.400
You just pretend to be Scrooge.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.280
- Mm-mm-mm. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

31:16.320 --> 31:19.680
Good day. Don't forget you have
a staff meeting at 3:00.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.760
- Oh, yeah. I'll see you gals tonight.
- Okay.

31:28.800 --> 31:31.920
Mmm. I wish I had redone
this kitchen years ago...

31:32.640 --> 31:34.920
when I had the money to do it.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.480
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just...

31:36.515 --> 31:38.320
I'm a little tired.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.440
I have my big
Minnie luncheon today.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.800
Just the thought of
all those Minnies is tiring.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.480
- I can make the lunch.
- You could make the lunch?

31:48.515 --> 31:50.365
Yeah, I'll call out
for Chinese...

31:50.400 --> 31:53.245
- or make some tuna fish sandwiches.
- No, no.

31:53.280 --> 31:56.160
This is the steering committee lunch
where we plan the Christmas trees.

31:56.195 --> 31:59.160
It's very important.
I'm gonna make chicken paillard...

31:59.195 --> 32:01.440
zucchini soup,
and my heavenly chocolate cake.

32:01.475 --> 32:03.325
Well, that's what
I'll make then.

32:03.360 --> 32:07.160
You can make chicken paillard
and zucchini soup and chocolate cake?

32:07.200 --> 32:10.160
Yeah. Just show me how.
It can't be that hard.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.800
Crap.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.040
Oh, shit! Mom!

33:17.280 --> 33:19.200
Can you come here, quick?

33:19.235 --> 33:21.085
No, I saw it on Donahue.

33:21.120 --> 33:24.440
This woman said a UFO landed
and took away her husband.

33:24.480 --> 33:28.120
- A UFO?
- And the UFO's name was probably Jennifer or Sophia.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.685
Yeah, but she saw something,
you know...

33:30.720 --> 33:34.560
and I think there are things in this world
that are mysterious and unexplainable.

33:34.595 --> 33:37.405
Yeah, like remember
when they had one calorie Tab.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.840
I was always wondering why the need
for that one calorie at all.

33:39.875 --> 33:41.640
Oh, there you are.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.120
Ellie made the lunch.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.960
Since Ellie made the lunch,
let's make her an honorary Minnie.

33:48.995 --> 33:50.640
Oh, yes, honey.

33:51.840 --> 33:54.720
- Come on in and sit down.
- I'm going to the library. I have work to do.

33:54.755 --> 33:57.377
- Oh, come on.
- Let's make Ellie an honorary Minnie.

33:57.412 --> 34:00.000
Come on in. Come on.
Bring the cake when you come.

34:00.035 --> 34:02.720
- A cake.
- She did all this by herself.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.245
- She made a cake?
- That is dear.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.680
- And I slept on the couch all morning.
- That's really nice...

34:07.715 --> 34:10.360
but I really have
to finish my article.

34:10.560 --> 34:14.360
And I couldn't be a Minnie.
There's really nothing Minnie about me.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.040
- Oh, don't be silly.
- I don't even like Christmas.

34:17.074 --> 34:19.199
Oh, Ellie. Ellie can help Kate
with her Christmas tree.

34:19.235 --> 34:21.199
Welcome to the Minnies.

34:21.600 --> 34:24.239
Now moving on
to other Minnie matters.

34:28.239 --> 34:30.199
It was... It was awful.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.239
It was awful.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.080
- Mmm.
- I guess that that world...

34:35.440 --> 34:37.920
it, um...
it just felt small to me.

34:39.760 --> 34:43.000
And, uh, and sometimes I felt
like I was going crazy.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.960
But since my mom was
so good at decorating...

34:49.840 --> 34:52.639
and doing those creative things
around the house...

34:52.675 --> 34:55.440
I suggested that she do
something with her talent...

34:56.560 --> 34:58.960
like, uh,
like decorate professionally.

34:58.995 --> 35:00.845
Start her own business.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.600
- You're kidding.
- No, it would be fun.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.160
Ellie, this is the Minnies'
busiest season. You know that.

35:06.195 --> 35:08.525
We have the Halloween festival
for the kids.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.925
We have Thanksgiving,
a benefit for the older people...

35:10.960 --> 35:14.960
and then we have to decorate all
the Christmas trees in the town square.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.480
Okay.

35:20.560 --> 35:21.880
Well...

35:22.960 --> 35:25.840
- Why-Why... You gonna
make coffee now? - Uh-huh.

35:25.875 --> 35:28.240
How are you gonna get
to sleep tonight if...

35:28.275 --> 35:30.440
It really doesn't affect me.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.400
Mm-hmm.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.680
We could do, um...

35:40.720 --> 35:42.200
a project.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.120
- A project?
- Mm-hmm.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.460
You and me.
Something we could do together.

35:47.495 --> 35:49.400
- Together.
- Yeah, something different...

35:49.435 --> 35:51.560
that you would like, like...

35:52.720 --> 35:55.000
- a book club.
- A book club?

35:55.600 --> 35:57.485
Why do you keep repeating
everything I say as if it's...

35:57.520 --> 36:00.400
- the most remarkable thing that you ever heard?
- I'm sorry. Okay.

36:00.435 --> 36:03.280
- No, a book club. That's good. Who else should we have?
- No one.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.640
- No one?
- There you go again.

36:08.120 --> 36:10.400
- Okay. A book club.
- Mm-hmm.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.600
- I hate what Jane Austen does in this book too.
- What? What?

36:15.320 --> 36:16.840
Well, she...

36:17.680 --> 36:20.280
The way she makes Jane,
the sweet...

36:20.600 --> 36:22.960
and domestic one,
the good one.

36:23.960 --> 36:26.360
She makes her second fiddle
to Elizabeth...

36:26.395 --> 36:28.725
the one who's
the outspoken and smart one.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.565
They do it at the college too...
women professors.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.965
They say, "Oh, you keep house.
That's terribly interesting".

36:35.000 --> 36:36.920
- Yeah, but I don't see...
- There's another book that does that.

36:36.955 --> 36:40.400
Little Women. Yes, the writer's
sister, um, she puts her...

36:42.200 --> 36:44.600
in opposition to the other one
that has babies.

36:44.635 --> 36:46.480
- But, what...
- Meg.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.885
So, you wanted to get back
to New York?

36:48.920 --> 36:52.160
- Right.
- You felt like you were wasting your time?

36:52.280 --> 36:54.360
Sort of. She seemed okay.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.560
- Your anger and resentment were building up.
- Yes.

36:57.595 --> 36:59.200
Well, I mean...

37:01.400 --> 37:02.800
No, um...

37:04.280 --> 37:07.080
The one thing that
I never wanted to do...

37:07.640 --> 37:10.960
was to live my mother's life,
and there I was doing it.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.480
Oh, this is my favorite!

37:14.840 --> 37:17.280
No! Not Bette Midler, Mom. Please.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.640
Oh, you like this one.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.760
It's just every time
we get in the car...

37:22.795 --> 37:24.817
I'm gonna get me
some of them

37:24.852 --> 37:26.840
Cause you got
to have friends

37:28.400 --> 37:30.680
Ba, ba, ba, ba
ba, ba, ba, ba

37:32.720 --> 37:34.080
Friends

37:35.120 --> 37:38.640
- Harmonize with me!
- But you're doing so nicely on your own.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.800
Friends

37:42.320 --> 37:44.400
I'm talking about friends

37:44.720 --> 37:47.565
- Mom, when are we gonna
turn around and head home?

37:47.600 --> 37:51.000
I told you. We have to go get yarn,
sweetheart. Remember?

37:53.840 --> 37:57.240
- Thank you, Kate.
- Okay, sweetheart. Come sit up with me.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.420
I'll see you next week,
if I'm spared.

38:01.455 --> 38:03.720
Thank you again.
I love your mother!

38:07.760 --> 38:09.000
Bye!

38:16.400 --> 38:17.600
Oh.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.640
Well, I think
she had fun though, don't you?

38:23.120 --> 38:24.520
No idea.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.925
Honey, give me a pill, will ya?
In the...

38:26.960 --> 38:29.980
Yeah. Look, we've been driving
around for hours...

38:30.015 --> 38:33.000
- There's a thermos down there too.
- wasting time.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.520
You don't feel well
and I need to meet Dad.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.840
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.760
- You know where we are?
- Canada.

38:48.080 --> 38:51.200
We just dropped Clarice off
at her mother's house.

38:51.920 --> 38:55.280
That's because she's been living there
for four months...

38:55.315 --> 38:58.480
since her husband left her,
and she hit rock bottom.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.880
And she stays inside all day
with the shades drawn.

39:04.915 --> 39:06.360
Every day.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.165
So, one of us
comes up once a week...

39:09.200 --> 39:11.120
and takes her out
to have some fun, you know.

39:11.155 --> 39:12.880
Have some laughs.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.760
And that's what we did today.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.760
I hope.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.240
You could always do work study.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.160
Right, and do what?

39:44.240 --> 39:47.000
You can work in the library.
That's easy.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.640
He's not here.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.765
So, who's he doing now?

39:54.800 --> 39:57.040
Probably Celine, his new T.A.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.600
You mean "T and A".

40:01.040 --> 40:02.560
I'd do him.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.880
Not me.
He's way too critical.

40:04.915 --> 40:06.765
I mean, can you imagine?

40:06.800 --> 40:10.200
"You have real talent,
but you must reach, goddamn it".

40:30.800 --> 40:32.685
- Hello?
- Hi, Kate.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.640
- Uh, George wanted me to give you a call.
- Harold.

40:34.675 --> 40:36.525
- Yeah, hi.
- Oh, hi.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.080
Yes. Ellie, is that you?
I have it.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.720
Sorry.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.045
So, when you worked
with James Sullivan...

41:12.080 --> 41:15.320
- would you say that he was driven?
- Oh, absolutely.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.680
Uh-huh.
How about voracious?

41:19.760 --> 41:22.240
What about
his drug use back then?

41:22.640 --> 41:24.525
- Did you find it?
- I'm coming... now.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.960
Thank you very much.
You've been really helpful.

41:26.995 --> 41:29.360
- What?
- Coming. Could you come now, please?

41:29.395 --> 41:30.640
What?

41:31.280 --> 41:35.240
- What is it?
- I've given her two, um, Percocets about an hour ago...

41:35.600 --> 41:37.485
but they don't seem
to be taking an effect.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.405
- I... I can't give her any more.
- No, absolutely not.

41:39.440 --> 41:43.000
- What's going on? - Well, I
can't find the-the heating pad.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.760
I need it.
I need the heating pad.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.560
- We didn't find it.
- You want the heating pad? Okay.

41:48.595 --> 41:50.445
She's in horrible pain.
She hasn't slept all night long.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.880
- You woke Ellie up. I told you not to wake her.
- I'm sorry.

41:52.915 --> 41:55.040
I think I... Oh, I hung it...

41:55.760 --> 41:57.400
Ellen, please.

41:58.640 --> 42:02.160
Here, here, here. Here we go.
Now I just have to plug it in.

42:02.480 --> 42:05.080
- Has she got it?
- Turn it on. Yeah.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.800
Yeah, she got it.
It's good.

42:15.440 --> 42:18.560
- You can go now. You can go to work.
- You think?

42:18.800 --> 42:21.165
- Yeah. Go to class now. It's okay.
- All right.

42:21.200 --> 42:24.800
- What else now? What else?
- I'll wait for Dr. Cohn to call.

42:25.520 --> 42:28.400
And, um, I'll cancel the reservation
at the Porchlight tonight, Kate.

42:28.435 --> 42:30.097
Yeah, that's good.

42:30.132 --> 42:31.760
- Shit! Jesus.
- Go.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.440
Go.

42:36.560 --> 42:40.160
- The pill didn't work yet, baby.
- Just wait a little longer.

42:41.360 --> 42:43.200
Is it getting warm?

42:43.280 --> 42:44.960
Yeah, somewhat.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.920
Yeah.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.360
I'm giving her Dilaudid
for her pain.

42:53.395 --> 42:55.720
It may make her a little groggy.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.760
And she shouldn't drive.
Her speech may be a little slurred.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.960
Even though you may see some
transient periods of improvement...

43:02.995 --> 43:05.360
she still shouldn't drive
while she's on this medication.

43:05.395 --> 43:06.640
Okay.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.680
I want to send a nurse
to monitor her vital signs.

43:09.715 --> 43:11.720
In fact, this afternoon.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.720
No, we don't need a nurse.
I can handle this.

43:14.755 --> 43:17.257
I insist. Your mother's
in a great deal of pain.

43:17.292 --> 43:19.760
She needs someone
she can be open with about it.

43:19.795 --> 43:22.040
Well, she can be open with me.

43:22.640 --> 43:24.040
Can she?

43:26.960 --> 43:29.440
- Still beating?
- Loud and clear.

43:30.800 --> 43:33.120
Now, what can I do
to help you, Mrs. Gulden?

43:33.155 --> 43:35.440
Tell me about your pain.
Is it constant?

43:36.560 --> 43:38.640
Mm-hmm. Pretty much, yes.

43:39.440 --> 43:42.520
But, um, this medication's
really helping me now.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.880
Okay. Are you having trouble
bathing and dressing?

43:49.040 --> 43:50.960
Well, sometimes I have
a little trouble...

43:50.995 --> 43:53.240
getting in and out of the tub.

43:53.360 --> 43:55.400
You didn't tell me that.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.645
Why didn't you tell me that?

43:57.680 --> 44:01.080
Oh, Ellie. There's so many things
for you to worry about.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.040
Well, let's go upstairs.

44:04.400 --> 44:07.280
I can show you some easy ways
to get in and out of the tub.

44:07.315 --> 44:08.560
Okay.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.360
Mm-hmm.

44:18.320 --> 44:20.240
Are you having problems
with anything else?

44:20.275 --> 44:22.520
Uh-uh. No.
Everything's, uh...

44:23.600 --> 44:25.600
Sometimes bending down.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.880
You know, it's hard.
Hard to get my trousers on sometimes.

44:28.915 --> 44:30.765
- Mm-hmm.
- And, um...

44:30.800 --> 44:35.040
But my bed is nice and high, so I have
no trouble getting in and out of there.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.720
- All right. Kate, I have a surprise.
- Hi.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.920
You have to close your eyes.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.760
- Oh.
- And keep them closed. Please, no cheating.

45:03.920 --> 45:06.600
- Ellen, you too.
- What are you doing?

45:27.920 --> 45:31.280
- What have you...
- No, no. Don't open your eyes just yet.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.760
- Ready? Open.
- It's so...

45:39.920 --> 45:41.520
Oh, it's so...

45:41.840 --> 45:45.480
If you can't go to the
Porchlight, the Porchlight comes to you.

45:49.520 --> 45:50.880
It's...

45:52.400 --> 45:53.840
fabulous.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.320
Oh, my.

46:11.240 --> 46:13.080
I don't believe it.

46:14.960 --> 46:16.240
Here.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.200
Mmm. Oh.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.480
It's so beautiful.

46:31.760 --> 46:34.880
And after dinner,
I've rented your favorite movie.

46:58.160 --> 46:59.640
You awake?

47:00.080 --> 47:02.800
- Go back to bed.
- I can't go to sleep.

47:03.440 --> 47:05.120
Go back to bed.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.340
Whatcha got in the box?

47:07.375 --> 47:09.320
Nothing. Go back to bed.

47:11.600 --> 47:14.040
I guess she doesn't need her pill.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.000
No. She's looking a lot better now.

47:17.035 --> 47:19.080
She's gonna be just fine.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.800
- Dad?
- Yeah.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.365
I was just thinking
that maybe...

47:28.400 --> 47:31.680
you could cut back on your classes,
help out a little.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.125
Ellie, I'd like to...

47:34.160 --> 47:36.525
but this is the busiest time
of the semester for me.

47:36.560 --> 47:40.000
I've got midterms, which means
I've got evening tutorials.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.640
Didn't you see her this morning?
She's getting worse.

47:44.240 --> 47:47.160
No, she's not.
Don't you ever say that again.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.480
- But, Dad...
- Ellen.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.920
Look, I have essays to grade.

48:03.955 --> 48:05.960
And I've got a deadline.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.720
Dad, if I don't finish
this article...

48:08.755 --> 48:10.605
I'm never going
to get my job back.

48:10.640 --> 48:13.840
- Don't you realize that?
- Ellen, enough. Midterms.

48:23.880 --> 48:27.080
I can see why people would think
that I didn't care.

48:27.720 --> 48:30.200
But I just didn't know
what to do.

48:31.080 --> 48:34.720
My mom would have a couple of bad days,
and then she'd be fine.

48:38.280 --> 48:41.920
And, uh, she was still doing
the things she'd always done. So...

48:42.600 --> 48:45.480
I was just wondering
if you could tell me...

48:45.515 --> 48:48.160
when he's gonna be released
from rehab.

48:48.360 --> 48:51.240
I'm just trying to be a friend,
which I'm sure that he needs right now.

48:51.275 --> 48:53.125
Is a friend of yours
in trouble?

48:53.160 --> 48:56.080
I'm-I'm sorry.
Can you hold on just a second?

49:00.840 --> 49:04.200
Anyhow, the reason why I'm asking
is because I'm sure that he's gonna...

49:04.235 --> 49:07.920
- Are you... Are you gonna get ready soon, because...
- I'm sorry.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.920
Um, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

49:10.955 --> 49:12.920
It's kind of important.

49:13.320 --> 49:16.400
Okay. So anyhow, I need
to know because I think...

49:17.160 --> 49:19.045
You don't have to come
if you don't want to, you know.

49:19.080 --> 49:23.080
- You really don't have to come. It's fine.
- I'm sorry. Just a second.

49:24.360 --> 49:27.380
You do know that this is
exactly what the Moonies do?

49:27.415 --> 49:30.400
They take your shoes,
your clothing, your identity.

49:30.600 --> 49:33.960
You sure the Minnies aren't
just an offshoot of the Moonies?

49:33.995 --> 49:37.080
Well, at least you're
wearing your favorite color.

49:37.320 --> 49:39.200
Next goblin, please.

49:39.240 --> 49:40.640
Come on.

49:41.640 --> 49:43.720
Look!
Two more Madonnas.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.360
- Hey, Kate.
- There's Clarice.

49:49.800 --> 49:51.920
Go back to work.
Go back.

49:58.440 --> 50:01.720
- Louise, give me a pie. I got to go first.
- Oh, no.

50:01.800 --> 50:05.000
You stand over there.
Stand over there. Stand over...

50:15.240 --> 50:17.560
Shh. Kate, don't make me laugh.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.725
- Home? Good.
- Yes, darling.

50:26.760 --> 50:29.760
- Hang in there.
- Let me see. No. Maybe I'll...

50:33.000 --> 50:34.840
Oh, my God! Evelyn.

50:36.840 --> 50:39.800
- You know, I really should get home.
- Okay.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.525
We'll go... pretty soon.

50:43.560 --> 50:45.960
I just want to go around one more time.

50:45.995 --> 50:47.880
Okay.
One more time.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.520
- But only once.
- One more.

51:00.360 --> 51:02.280
Okay.
One more time.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.040
Okay.

51:09.480 --> 51:12.280
- Whew.
- Whew, look at the little leaves.

51:12.360 --> 51:15.280
Like they're in a big hurry
to get somewhere.

51:16.200 --> 51:18.280
Those Minnies go all out.

51:19.080 --> 51:21.480
- Yep, they do.
- They go all out.

51:21.515 --> 51:23.560
Very creative women, huh?

51:23.880 --> 51:26.120
- Yes. What?
- More is more.

51:27.240 --> 51:29.640
- You know, your dad always
says less is more. - Mm-hmm.

51:29.675 --> 51:31.520
To me, more is more.

51:32.040 --> 51:34.400
Oh, I love walking in Langhorne.

51:39.240 --> 51:40.600
Uh-huh.

51:44.040 --> 51:46.040
It's a beautiful night.

51:47.880 --> 51:49.480
Are you okay?

51:50.760 --> 51:53.120
- Mom?
- Uh-huh. You hear that?

51:53.160 --> 51:55.320
- What? Hear what?
- That.

51:56.520 --> 51:57.800
What?

51:58.920 --> 52:02.280
Why, I guess it's the rumble
of the furnaces or something.

52:02.315 --> 52:05.320
You know, Langhorne kind of,
I don't know, hums.

52:06.600 --> 52:09.480
It's... Even in the summertime
you can hear...

52:10.920 --> 52:13.360
Maybe it's the air conditioners...

52:13.800 --> 52:15.760
crickets, or the bees.

52:16.680 --> 52:17.920
Hmm.

52:20.040 --> 52:22.960
No, I think it's something more.
You hear it?

52:25.320 --> 52:26.520
No.

52:27.240 --> 52:28.960
You can feel it.

52:32.040 --> 52:34.360
Trick-or-treaters. Oh, my gosh.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.800
They're gonna beat us home.
You go get your dad up at the college.

52:37.835 --> 52:39.685
- Tell him to hurry up.
- Are you sure?

52:39.720 --> 52:42.120
Yeah, I know he's doesn't
want to miss this fun.

52:42.155 --> 52:44.480
Trick-or-treat.
Trick-or-treat.

52:48.840 --> 52:50.080
Dad.

54:10.440 --> 54:12.040
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:14.280 --> 54:16.200
Well, you missed
all the trick-or-treaters.

54:16.235 --> 54:18.000
They were so cute.

54:18.600 --> 54:21.440
Remember when Brian
dressed up like a dice?

54:22.960 --> 54:24.845
And he tipped over
and you wouldn't help him up...

54:24.880 --> 54:27.240
because you were so busy
laughing at his little legs...

54:27.275 --> 54:30.000
scrambling around in the air
like a bug.

54:31.560 --> 54:35.240
- Did you find your dad?
- His secretary said he had a late class.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.640
Oh. That's too bad.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.760
You okay, Ellie?

54:47.440 --> 54:49.520
- Uh-huh. Great.
- Good.

54:51.280 --> 54:53.080
I love this movie.

54:54.760 --> 54:56.525
Do you think
about politics much?

54:56.560 --> 54:59.440
And if so, what do you think
about politics?

55:38.800 --> 55:42.520
You know how some of these
meetings can go. Some of the faculty...

55:43.120 --> 55:46.000
- Uh-huh. - You know, one of
the students had a little...

55:46.035 --> 55:48.920
- Oh.
- So he, uh, he just wanted me to call.

55:49.840 --> 55:52.720
- Okay.
- He thought you... Yeah, he thought you shouldn't...

55:52.755 --> 55:54.920
He didn't want you to worry.

55:55.120 --> 55:58.040
- All right. Thank you, Harold.
- It's just...

55:58.480 --> 56:01.440
Yeah, it's just another one
of those meetings.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.040
Ellen?

56:07.600 --> 56:09.320
- Ellen?
- Hmm?

56:10.960 --> 56:14.680
I was asking about your father.
You haven't really mentioned him.

56:15.280 --> 56:18.440
- Was he not around that much?
- No, he was around.

56:19.120 --> 56:21.600
Um, he was busy with his classes...

56:22.480 --> 56:25.240
but-but he managed
to spend time at home.

56:27.280 --> 56:28.720
I looked at my American Express
bill one January...

56:28.755 --> 56:30.880
and went into ring failure.

56:31.120 --> 56:34.960
I was so opposed to name tags that once
when a women slapped a gummed label...

56:34.995 --> 56:37.325
over my left bosom that said,
"Hello, my name is Erma..."

56:37.360 --> 56:40.240
I leaned over and said,
"Now what shall we name the other one?"

56:40.275 --> 56:42.160
What are you reading?

56:43.120 --> 56:45.080
Aunt Erma's Cope Book:

56:46.000 --> 56:48.880
How To Get From Monday
To Friday In Twelve Days.

56:48.915 --> 56:50.765
- Hey, guys?
- Up here.

56:50.800 --> 56:55.000
- Shall I put it away?
- You'd better or else he'll call the thought police.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.605
And they'll come in in tweed jackets...

56:57.640 --> 57:00.520
and pummel us with rolled up
New York Times.

57:00.880 --> 57:03.460
Whoa! Is this dissension
in the ranks?

57:03.495 --> 57:06.040
Should I do my reading
from this tonight?

57:06.160 --> 57:09.920
No. No readings this Thanksgiving.
Nobody even likes the readings.

57:10.600 --> 57:13.240
- It's just gonna be us.
- And Jordan.

57:13.840 --> 57:16.205
Wait a minute. You're gonna buck
26 years of tradition?

57:16.240 --> 57:19.600
You're gonna take away Frost and Whitman
and all those other exciting dead guys?

57:19.635 --> 57:21.965
- Are you feeling all right?
- Shut up.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.480
You are not going to believe
who is downstairs with Harold.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.480
Oliver Most...

57:27.760 --> 57:29.960
poet laureate, in our house.

57:33.520 --> 57:36.120
- What is that book?
- Oh, it's mine.

57:36.880 --> 57:40.920
Ellen, could you put up, like, some
hors d'oeuvres or something for them?

57:41.200 --> 57:42.960
Are they staying?

57:43.120 --> 57:44.400
Yeah.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.440
- Hmm.
- Uh-huh. Great.

57:52.240 --> 57:53.920
- Dad?
- Yeah.

57:55.600 --> 57:58.880
It was just supposed
to be Jordan and us, just family.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.040
Well, I mean...

58:04.240 --> 58:08.560
They have no place else to go. Oliver is
down from Harvard for a book-signing tour.

58:08.595 --> 58:12.400
He's all by himself. Come on. You know
your mother loves Oliver Most's work.

58:12.435 --> 58:14.000
You promised.

58:14.440 --> 58:17.560
Well, I can't very well
disinvite them now, can I?

58:18.640 --> 58:22.000
And we could all use a little
holiday cheer around here now.

58:22.035 --> 58:23.560
Couldn't we?

58:33.040 --> 58:34.400
Get up!

58:36.040 --> 58:38.960
- Okay. Thank you.
- Oh, Ellen. You did this?

58:39.280 --> 58:42.400
- Oh, Ellie.
- You don't have to be concerned with things like that.

58:42.435 --> 58:45.417
- There's plenty of time.
- I have to pay my father when I get back.

58:45.452 --> 58:48.400
- I don't know if I feel good about it.
- Would you like some wine?

58:48.435 --> 58:50.765
Well, you know,
there is plenty of time.

58:50.800 --> 58:54.240
A writer writes something.
He calls his friend. He says...

58:54.640 --> 58:57.965
"I'm finished writing a little
something, and it's not very good.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.320
In fact, it's terrible. The worse part
about it is it's the best thing I can do.,,

59:02.355 --> 59:05.040
And that was Steinbeck,
Grapes of Wrath.

59:06.160 --> 59:09.005
Your father tells me you write
literary reviews from time to time.

59:09.040 --> 59:12.880
- Mm-hmm. That's right. - That's
interesting. Like father, like daughter.

59:12.915 --> 59:16.240
Tell me, have you ever had the
opportunity to review any of my work?

59:16.275 --> 59:17.480
Um...

59:21.520 --> 59:24.160
- I want to say grace now.
- Oh, good.

59:27.280 --> 59:30.120
Uh, no, George,
I want to say my own grace.

59:31.120 --> 59:32.600
Of course.

59:41.200 --> 59:43.600
Thank you for the world so sweet.

59:44.200 --> 59:46.480
Thank you for the food we eat.

59:47.920 --> 59:50.360
Thank you for the birds that sing.

59:50.800 --> 59:53.120
Thank you, God, for everything.

59:54.640 --> 59:58.560
And thank you, Ellie, for making
such a beautiful Thanksgiving dinner.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.200
Sure.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.560
- Bravo.
- To Chef Boyardee.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.240
- Shut up. That's terrible.
- Well...

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.845
to our great surprise and delight...

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.240
tonight has become a night to go down
in our family's history books.

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:19.440
We have the honor to have
with us Oliver Most, who...

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.965
whose work means so much to me...

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.360
and who was the first to encourage me
with Comeback Inn.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.280
He's agreed after dinner
to read to us from his new book...

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.240
for which I...

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.965
I'm very grateful.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.520
Well, George, I'm happy to oblige...

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.880
but you're gonna have
to remind me.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.600
What in the hell is Comeback Inn?

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.760
It sounds as if I've encouraged you
to invest in some sort of...

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.760
uh, roadside motel.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.120
Honey, would you pass
the vegetables around?

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:57.520
Yeah. You want
some carrots, sweetheart?

01:00:57.555 --> 01:00:59.240
That's my novel.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.720
- My novel.
- Yeah.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.440
Well, Jesus, George.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.760
As Thurber says,
"With 60 staring me in the face...

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.800
"I've developed inflammation
of the sentence structure...

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.120
- a definite hardening of the paragraph.,,
- Everything looks beautiful.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.520
Up in my blue room

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.320
Fools rush in
and not to bed

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.960
I am the rich
of the real dead head

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.200
Sure am gonna love you
one more time

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.840
Little bit of whiskey
Little bit of my mind

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.720
Well, you don't know
the things I see in here

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.040
Hey, did you see my dad tonight?

01:01:57.075 --> 01:01:58.800
He just kills me.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.840
You know, he doesn't say one word
to me about dinner...

01:02:01.875 --> 01:02:04.205
and then he just goes off
to his study.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.440
Like we're servants there
to serve him or something.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.440
Hello? Another round.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.760
- What are you, Janice Joplin? Take it easy on the sauce, okay?
- No. No.

01:02:15.795 --> 01:02:18.720
- I have not been out in two months.
- I know.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.040
- I deserve another drink.
- I know.

01:02:21.075 --> 01:02:22.445
I deserve another drink...

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.360
especially since it's been
like that since the beginning.

01:02:25.395 --> 01:02:27.725
Do you know
he doesn't do anything?

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.640
He really doesn't. He doesn't
do anything. I do everything.

01:02:30.675 --> 01:02:33.005
- I do. I do everything.
- I realize that.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.920
But I think in situations like this,
you have to...

01:02:35.955 --> 01:02:37.805
be sympathetic with people.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.720
I mean, everybody has to deal with
bad stuff in their own way, you know.

01:02:40.755 --> 01:02:42.000
What?

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:49.400
Whenever you guys say that people
deal with stuff in their own way...

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.200
it means that you don't
deal with it at all.

01:02:53.235 --> 01:02:55.565
We deal with it.
We make the meals...

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.040
and we clean up the messes
and we listen while you guys...

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.920
talk about how you're gonna
deal with stuff in your own way.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.000
Well, what way is that, Jordan?
Hmm? What way is that?

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.000
What way?

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.040
See? No way.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.520
- And what the fuck are you looking at?
- Hey, hey.

01:03:15.555 --> 01:03:17.645
- Huh?
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.080
- No, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
- What's the matter with you?

01:03:20.115 --> 01:03:22.640
Well, you know what
I think is rude?

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.845
- I think it's rude...
- Hey, stop it. I'm trying to talk.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.280
- when Little Miss Delta-Delta-Delta
over here... - Stop it. Stop it!

01:03:27.315 --> 01:03:29.697
- Is trying to pick up on my boyfriend...
- Stop it. Stop it.

01:03:29.732 --> 01:03:32.045
- In front of my face.
- Why don't you just lay off of her?

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.000
- Your sister's losing her mind.
- Do you think I look invisible?

01:03:34.035 --> 01:03:36.040
I am not losing my mind!

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.480
I am not losing my mind!
I am just tired, Jordan.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.640
- I am tired. I am tired.
- Ellen, let's go.

01:03:42.675 --> 01:03:44.525
Being my mother is very tiring.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.925
Oh, come on. There's nobody more
different than your mother than you.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.360
- Come on. Let's go.
- That is the stupidest thing that you have ever said.

01:03:49.395 --> 01:03:52.960
- Okay. Great.
- That's the stupidest thing you've ever said.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.440
Oh, God.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.680
- Ellie.
- Yeah.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.720
- You all right?
- Yeah, I just have a headache.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.360
- What happened to Jordan? I heard Brian go upstairs...
- Yeah, yeah.

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:28.240
He has to go to work tomorrow,
so he just took the train back.

01:04:28.275 --> 01:04:30.560
Hmm. You sure you're all right?

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.560
How do you do this...

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.000
every day, all day in this house...

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.360
and no one notices?

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.000
Doesn't that drive you crazy?

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.320
But this is my family, Ellie.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.640
These are the people I love.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.120
Maybe it's time for you to start
thinking about going back to New York.

01:04:55.155 --> 01:04:57.800
Maybe you should go back
to the city...

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.960
to your work and your writing and
all those things that you like to do.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.200
That's what's important, sweetie.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.320
You know, we can get somebody
to help out around here. That's not...

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.480
But you did a great job tonight.
You should be proud of yourself.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.120
Night-night, sweetheart.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.400
Good night.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.040
Hello.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.320
Mr. Tweedy, hi.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.680
A press conference? Where?

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.000
The next train
is not till 5:00. Shit.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.960
- Then Casey...
- No, don't send Casey. I'll be there.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.040
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.720
Excuse me. No.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.960
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.480
Too late is unacceptable.
You said you'd get the story.

01:06:55.515 --> 01:06:57.365
And I will.
I'll find him.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.800
Look, I've got a contact at Sullivan's
office. He's getting on a plane at 9:00.

01:06:59.835 --> 01:07:02.165
No, no, no. I've worked
on this thing for three months.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.080
- He's staying at the Plaza Athene. I can check it out.
- Anyone can figure that out.

01:07:05.115 --> 01:07:07.960
No, I will meet him there. I'll meet
him at the Plaza Athene before he leaves.

01:07:07.995 --> 01:07:09.880
This is my story,
goddamn it!

01:07:09.915 --> 01:07:11.640
This is my story.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.560
Good night, sir.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.400
Taxi!

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.160
Hey, don't I know you?

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.960
- I don't think so.
- Yes, we went to Harvard together.

01:07:55.995 --> 01:07:58.360
Ellen Gulden.
You were a couple of years ahead of me.

01:07:58.395 --> 01:08:01.320
I wrote for the women's magazine,
Peeved Eves.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.160
I remember Peeved Eves.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.680
- Well, it's nice to see you.
- Yeah, yeah. Nice to see you too.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:14.200
Got to get to J.F.K in time
for the last commuter shuttle.

01:08:14.235 --> 01:08:16.680
It's my daughter's
birthday today.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.600
If you're going to J.F.K,
I can give you a lift.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.200
I moved to Seattle a couple of months
ago to get away from all the cameras...

01:08:26.234 --> 01:08:28.319
my ex-wife and my ex-kids.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.399
Yeah, you know, I think I saw something
about that on television.

01:08:33.435 --> 01:08:36.200
- How horrible.
- You know what's strange?

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.640
- One minute you're in school and the
next minute you look up... - Mm-hmm.

01:08:39.675 --> 01:08:41.524
and your life's all turned around
and screwed up.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.920
- Yes, I know. Yeah.
- You try and you try to get ahead.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:48.640
Somewhere in it all you just...

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.560
You lose yourself.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.560
- And you never know when
it's gonna come. - Mm-hmm.

01:08:53.595 --> 01:08:56.240
Comes out of nowhere.
Bang. It's just...

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.765
- Your life is a disaster.
- Yep.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.960
Oh, I just hope I can make it up
to my wife and kids.

01:09:01.995 --> 01:09:04.120
You know, that's all that counts.
That's all that counts.

01:09:04.154 --> 01:09:05.960
Yeah, you're right.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.160
They're the ones who love you.
That's what counts.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.359
I'm reading, Mom.
And baby cows are calves.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.840
You're right.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.160
G.A. Tweedy here.
Leave a message after the noise.

01:09:51.194 --> 01:09:53.160
Mr. Tweedy, it's Ellen.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.280
Uh...

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.260
Listen, I waited
for Sullivan...

01:10:00.295 --> 01:10:02.640
outside of his hotel,
and, uh...

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.080
Well, he never showed.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.080
Damn.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.560
Here we go.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.160
They're several reasons why I asked you
here today, one of which...

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.440
- Hi, John. Peter.
- George.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.760
One of which is to ask you...

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.160
why you were
so hostile with me...

01:10:39.195 --> 01:10:40.880
at Thanksgiving.

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.280
I know this is not
the best situation for any of us.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.440
But I'm trying, Ellen.
I'm trying to be patient.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.280
I have some questions
that I'd like to discuss with you.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.760
- I don't think I want to talk about the interview.
- I do.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.520
Okay, Ellen.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.080
How come Mom waited so long?

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.400
Why didn't she go
to the doctor sooner?

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.920
- What are you talking about?
- Was it because you didn't want your world disrupted?

01:11:20.955 --> 01:11:24.360
Because you needed her
to keep your life running smoothly?

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.645
Like you need me now?

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.660
- What the hell are you doing?
- Because she can't do it all?

01:11:29.695 --> 01:11:32.640
Well, do you have any idea
what it takes to keep your life...

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.760
- running so smoothly?
- Ellen, have you lost your mind?

01:11:36.795 --> 01:11:39.160
- Maybe.
- Keep your voice down.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.485
- This is inappropriate.
- It is appropriate!

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:46.240
Everything at our house has changed,
but you don't know about it.

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.720
Because you're behaving
as though life goes on as usual.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.400
Well, life as we know it is done!
This is real life!

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.200
Fuck fiction!

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.200
Less is not more!

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.280
You have taken sabbaticals
for the great American novel.

01:12:03.315 --> 01:12:05.045
Why not one for Mom?

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.440
Why won't you participate
in the most important thing...

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.240
that has happened in your life?

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.000
She needs you.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.560
Why is it always more important
for you to hear...

01:12:17.595 --> 01:12:20.120
what some writer has to say
than me?

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.840
And Brian?

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.440
Hey.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.760
Hey, what other tricks do you use
besides your fucking apples...

01:12:37.795 --> 01:12:40.480
to get your writing juices
flowing, Dad?

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.485
Cheating on Mom, is that one?

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.120
I will hire a full-time nurse.
You are going back to New York.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.640
What other tricks?

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.880
Several people have mentioned...

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.560
a heated argument that you had
with your father...

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.840
outside the campus cafe.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.640
It was shortly
after Thanksgiving.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.640
Do you recall the incident?

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.960
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I remember.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.160
It was a stressful time...

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.160
and there was a lot to do
and it was hard.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.600
So, there was no problem
between you and your father?

01:13:29.635 --> 01:13:30.800
No.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.360
Or your father
and your mother?

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.920
My mother and my father?

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.240
Of course not.
It was a busy time.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.680
I mean, I was
a full-fledged Minnie.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I remember we were making
the, uh, ornaments...

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.720
the craft ornaments
with the feathers and the sequins...

01:13:50.755 --> 01:13:53.640
for my mother's
Christmas tree in the square.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.640
And, uh, I would climb
up the ladder...

01:13:56.675 --> 01:13:59.200
and she would tell me
where to put them.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.080
It was a lot of fun.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.200
Yeah, it's really not that bad.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.480
Yeah, it's okay.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.280
You know, I always used to try
to get you to go see Santa.

01:14:19.315 --> 01:14:22.365
For years and years.
And then when you were 8 years old...

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.360
you got in line and you went to
the very front, pulled his beard off...

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.080
- Pulled his beard off.
- and yelled, "Fraud!"

01:14:30.115 --> 01:14:32.320
Your dad was so proud of you.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.680
Well, guess what?

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.960
- I'm getting in the line. Yes.
- Oh, now you want to.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.960
- Uh-huh.
- Good girl. Go on. Be good.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.120
- Ellen Gulden.
- Hello.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.285
- Hi.
- I know what you want:

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.960
a new computer
and Diane Sawyer's job.

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.640
I'm here, okay?
Okay, here we go.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.800
Nothing for me, Mayor.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.560
Santa.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.720
I guess maybe it is for me.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.480
I really... I...

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.400
Mom!

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.640
Mom!

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.640
Excuse me, is there
a phone that I can use?

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.960
Sure.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.480
This line right here.
Press nine to get out.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.800
Answer the phone, Dad.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.920
Ellen?

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.725
Mom's in the hospital.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:53.480
The cancer has progressed
much more quickly than we had expected.

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.480
I'm sorry, but I think it's best
to stop the chemotherapy.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.280
Uh, you know what? Um, I'm not
ready to stop the chemotherapy.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.400
I'm afraid there's
no more we can do.

01:17:10.435 --> 01:17:12.560
We all need now to focus...

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.160
on helping her through
this next part.

01:17:16.195 --> 01:17:18.045
I'm putting her on morphine.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:21.405
You'll need to give her
one tablet twice a day for the pain.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.280
They shouldn't be chewed or crushed
because they might become toxic.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.520
I am sorry.
I'll get you the prescription.

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.320
So, what do you think of the wheels?

01:17:48.355 --> 01:17:50.205
Oh, they look wonderful.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.640
- You like 'em?
- Oh, gosh, it's like what we used to do...

01:17:52.675 --> 01:17:55.520
- to the bikes when you were kids.
- Uh-huh.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.920
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, Brian.

01:17:57.955 --> 01:17:59.280
You do.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.240
- No coat?
- No, I don't need one. I'm layered, honey.

01:18:02.275 --> 01:18:04.840
I just wanna show off
my new sweater.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.040
Oh, I love Christmas!

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.480
I love it.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.800
- Hey!
- Hey, folks! Merry Christmas.

01:18:12.835 --> 01:18:14.880
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi!

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.560
- Oh, everybody's out tonight.
- Are we late?

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.320
They should shovel that, you know. They
should shovel that more carefully than that.

01:18:24.355 --> 01:18:26.240
- Well, honey, you should do it. Hey!
- Hey, you guys!

01:18:26.275 --> 01:18:28.160
- Merry Christmas.
- Hello.

01:18:28.195 --> 01:18:29.760
June Fortier.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.680
Get up here, you.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.600
Clarice Mitchell.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.880
- There she is.
- Oh, great!

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.440
- Hi, Kate. How are you?
- Hi, Ellen. How are you?

01:18:45.475 --> 01:18:48.360
- Hi, Brian, George. Kate.
- Melissa Jamison.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.685
Well, you just look wonderful.
You look wonderful.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.640
- Well, thanks. Don't go get mushy on me.
- I just love the sweater.

01:18:52.675 --> 01:18:54.880
- Oh, thanks.
- Evelyn Best.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.360
Kate Gulden.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.725
And Ellen Gulden.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.125
We see you, Ellen.
You can't hide. Come on.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.280
- We need all the Minnies up here.
- Come on, now.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:40.480
And now for the moment
we have all been waiting for.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.240
Happy holidays, Langhorne!

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.840
Silent night

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.560
Holy night

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.400
All is calm

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.800
All is bright

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.200
Round yon virgin

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.000
Mother and child

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.600
Holy infant

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.720
So tender and mild

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.600
Sleep in

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.480
Heavenly

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.240
Peace

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.680
Sleep in

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.800
Heavenly peace

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.920
Silent night

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.640
Holy night

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:58.640
Shepherds quake

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:03.320
At the sight

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.720
Glories stream

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.080
From heaven afar

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.800
Heavenly hosts

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.600
Sing alleluia

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.520
Christ the Savior

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.440
Is born

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.600
Christ the Savior

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.040
Is born

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.800
Having trouble juggling everything.

01:21:54.835 --> 01:21:56.925
Gee, I haven't dropped one yet.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.480
I couldn't help it. It was a reflex.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.080
Oh, here...

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.440
- Oh, hi!
- Oh, my God!

01:22:09.475 --> 01:22:11.080
- Whoa!
- Hi.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.040
- Nice hat.
- Oh, thank you.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.080
- You didn't tell your mom?
- How could I tell her?

01:22:20.115 --> 01:22:22.525
She's never known
about my dad's little flings.

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.040
God, he's still doing it, you know?
He's got this friend...

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.960
this fucking Harold guy,
who calls and makes excuses for him.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.600
And this woman, she dropped him off
right in front of the house.

01:22:33.635 --> 01:22:36.240
- God!
- Oh, God. Why won't he answer?

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:40.160
This is the third time
I've tried to call him today.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.560
The red and gold one is ours.

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.240
- Oh. Hey, it's beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.365
My mom says with a tree that size,
the key is "gaudy".

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.200
- More is more.
- What are you doing? Ellen, don't call him again.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.840
I don't want him to worry.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.520
He's still really upset about
Thanksgiving and I think that...

01:22:59.555 --> 01:23:01.920
he was afraid to come
and visit me for the holidays.

01:23:01.955 --> 01:23:04.285
- Oh, please!
- No, I'm serious.

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.200
- I was really, really hard on him.
- Ellen!

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.520
- Hello?
- Hi. Is Jordan there?

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.320
Yeah, he's paying for the Chinese food.
Do you wanna hold on?

01:23:16.355 --> 01:23:18.040
No, that's okay.

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:24.200
Some girl answered and said
that he was paying...

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.040
the Chinese delivery guy.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.160
Okay, uh, Chinese food at home.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.400
- It's New Year's.
- Shit!

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.200
- Shit!
- Shit! Don't call him again.

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.640
El!

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:43.040
Come on, Jordan,
just pick up the phone.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.565
- Answer.
- Hi. This is...

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.480
- Oh, puts the answering machine on.
- Okay, good, then hang up.

01:23:48.515 --> 01:23:51.000
Hi, Jordan. It's me. Just calling...

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.160
to say happy New Year's
and to tell you that...

01:23:56.195 --> 01:23:58.817
I've really been thinking
about what you said...

01:23:58.852 --> 01:24:01.440
about how we needed to talk
about our plans.

01:24:01.475 --> 01:24:03.680
And yeah, we do need to talk.

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:05.720
I just...

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.360
I-I wanna talk.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.560
And, uh...

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.840
if you get a chance,
uh, call me.

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.040
Okay?

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:24.200
And I really hope that
you have a happy New Year.

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.200
Okay.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.000
Sorry.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.600
Is everybody ready?

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.440
Uh, would you... Kate? Darling?

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.365
- Here we go.
- With what?

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.800
- It's almost time for the big moment.
- New Year's resolutions.

01:24:52.835 --> 01:24:54.685
- Okay.
- Another great Gulden family tradition.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.600
Can't dwell on the negative.
Gotta talk about all the great things...

01:24:57.635 --> 01:24:59.965
- that we're gonna accomplish next year.
- Ellen.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.360
- Please.
- Wouldn't it be a lot easier if we could just admit...

01:25:03.395 --> 01:25:06.205
to our failures,
the things that we fucked up on.

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:09.120
- Ellen, would you not use that word in the house, please?
- Sorry.

01:25:09.155 --> 01:25:10.525
Used the "F" word.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.360
Failure isn't allowed
in the Gulden house.

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:16.285
You know, maybe-maybe
we should break tradition this year.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.165
And since I've got a hell of
a good list of failures, I'll start.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.080
- I think it's not a good idea. - No, no.
Come on. Come on. - I don't think so either.

01:25:22.115 --> 01:25:24.480
- I'd like to. Yeah, I'd like to.
- You'd like to.

01:25:24.515 --> 01:25:26.845
Uh, lost my desk
at the magazine.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.760
Uh, really fucked up
the Sullivan interview.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:36.120
- have, uh, really ruined...
- What are you talking about? Why didn't you say something?

01:25:36.155 --> 01:25:38.800
my relationship
with my boyfriend, so...

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.720
- There we go. Happy New Year.
- I failed my English class last semester...

01:25:42.755 --> 01:25:46.400
I'm on academic probation,
and I got kicked off the tennis team.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.925
- Happy New Year.
- Jesus Christ, Brian.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.360
- I could get a tutor. I could help you.
- What's this?

01:25:51.395 --> 01:25:53.777
Mom, I got a job at
the Cambridge Racquet Club.

01:25:53.812 --> 01:25:56.160
- Oh.
- And I don't wanna go back to school.

01:25:56.195 --> 01:25:58.360
You got a job? That's great.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.400
- Isn't it?
- Ten, nine, eight, seven...

01:26:02.435 --> 01:26:04.840
- You like it?
- Yeah, I love it.

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.160
- That's wonderful. That's what you should do then.
- six, five, four, three...

01:26:08.195 --> 01:26:11.880
- Good God, you only live once.
- two, one... and we're into 1988!

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.800
The holidays seemed to take
a lot out of my mother.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
It was right after New Year's when
her health really started to decline.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.200
And this guy in my class
was going on and on...

01:26:31.235 --> 01:26:33.760
about how selfish
she was and how...

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.965
of course, she would leave.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.640
So my professor, who's a woman, said...

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.280
"Anna Karenina would have left
her husband for her lover...

01:26:41.315 --> 01:26:43.645
"but would never
have left her son.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:47.200
And had Tolstoy been a woman,
he would've understood that.,,

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.360
- What do you think of that?
- I haven't been reading Anna Karenina.

01:26:51.395 --> 01:26:53.760
No more whipping. That's enough.
Just drain the cherries.

01:26:53.795 --> 01:26:56.360
You have two hours
till Brian leaves.

01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:00.000
You know I wanna have his pie
ready for him when he goes.

01:27:00.035 --> 01:27:01.885
I think the crust
is probably ready too.

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.800
- You better check that.
- It should probably bake a little longer, but I can...

01:27:04.835 --> 01:27:07.040
I can't read anything anyway.

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.720
My eyesight's gone
like an old lady. Let me see.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.360
- Uh, I don't think...
- Let me see. Let me...

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:18.440
Goddamn it!
I hate this stupid chair.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.045
I hate it. I hate it.
I wish I could...

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.000
just roll it down the street right
through Evelyn Best's front window.

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.285
She pet me like a cat at Christmas.
Did you see that?

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.680
Don't-Don't do that. Just leave it.
Get-Get another pie plate.

01:27:31.715 --> 01:27:34.560
There's another one
over in the left-hand cubby.

01:27:34.595 --> 01:27:36.445
Have time to make another.

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.365
- Left, left-hand cubby.
- No, actually.

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.480
I put them in here. And you know, Mom,
there's handicap access everywhere.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.565
I am not handicapped!

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.360
- Oh, God, I'm not!
- What are you doing?

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.845
- I am not an invalid!
- Stop that!

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.760
I am not! I am not!
It's my house, you know.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:57.320
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm still a mother.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.440
Still a mother here.

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.640
Mom, I know that.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.280
- Hello.
- Ellen, I'm going to be working late tonight.

01:28:29.315 --> 01:28:32.160
- Sorry I didn't make it home for supper.
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:32.195 --> 01:28:34.257
I'll get there as soon as I can.

01:28:34.292 --> 01:28:36.320
Yeah, I'm sure you will, Dad.

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.080
- Who was that?
- It was your husband.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.080
Seems he's working late again.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:47.880
Well, it's a tough job
running that whole department.

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.120
- Not that tough.
- Whatever you're doing, stop and come here.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.720
Right now!

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.240
- Yeah?
- What has happened...

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:07.560
- between you and your father?
- What do you mean?

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.920
You've been so angry at him
ever since you came home.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.120
I don't know. I mean,
there's some stuff that...

01:29:15.155 --> 01:29:17.725
I mean, it doesn't have
anything to do with you.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:20.160
- Pretty soon he's all you'll have, you know.
- Please, Mom, stop.

01:29:20.195 --> 01:29:21.800
No.
You stop.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.965
He's gonna need you.
You're gonna need each other.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.360
My God, you used to be so close.
What... The two of you are so alike.

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.720
- Please don't say that.
- Why?

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.600
Because he's not perfect?
Because he's not the man...

01:29:33.635 --> 01:29:35.440
you thought he was?

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.800
No, I... No, I can't...
I can't talk about this with you.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.640
- Come back here. Come on. I want you to sit down here.
- I can't.

01:29:44.675 --> 01:29:47.600
I want...
I want to talk to you. You sit there.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.680
Now you listen to me because
I'm only going to say this once...

01:29:55.715 --> 01:29:58.360
and I probably
shouldn't say it at all.

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.840
There is nothing that you know
about your father that I don't know.

01:30:03.875 --> 01:30:05.240
Nothing.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.160
And understand better.

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.880
Okay?

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.800
You make concessions
when you're married a long time...

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.240
that you don't believe you'll make
when you're beginning.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.560
When you're young, you say,
"Oh, I'll never tolerate...

01:30:22.595 --> 01:30:24.480
this or that or the other thing.,,

01:30:24.515 --> 01:30:26.365
But time goes by, darling.

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:29.245
And when you've slept together
a thousand nights...

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:32.680
and you've smelled like spit-up
from the babies when they're sick...

01:30:32.715 --> 01:30:35.525
and you've seen your body
droop and get soft...

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:39.360
and some nights you just think, "Oh, God,
I'm not gonna put up with it another minute".

01:30:39.395 --> 01:30:41.537
But you wake up
in the next morning...

01:30:41.572 --> 01:30:43.645
and the kitchen smells
like coffee...

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.560
and the kids have their hair brushed
all by themselves...

01:30:46.595 --> 01:30:48.877
and you look at your husband,
and no...

01:30:48.912 --> 01:30:51.160
he's not the person
you thought he was.

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.160
But he's your life.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:59.320
And the kids and the house and everything
that you do is built around him.

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:02.405
And that's your life.
That's your history too.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:06.280
And if you take him out, that's like
cutting his face out of all the pictures.

01:31:06.315 --> 01:31:09.360
It just makes a big hole
and it ruins everything.

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.560
You can be hard, Ellen.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:17.285
And you can be very judgmental.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.680
And with those two things alone you're
gonna make such a mess out of your life...

01:31:20.715 --> 01:31:24.040
you wouldn't believe, and I wanna be able
to tell you these things in ten years.

01:31:24.075 --> 01:31:27.880
And when I think how most of what you
learned so far came from your dad...

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:31.320
- it just hurts my heart to think how little...
- No. No.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.605
- I have gotten done.
- Mom, don't, um...

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:36.040
- Yes, yes.
- Just, let's not talk about that. Can we...

01:31:36.075 --> 01:31:38.405
I wanna talk. You let me talk.
Now, look. Let me talk.

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:41.320
You're dad won't let me talk
because he says I'll upset myself.

01:31:41.355 --> 01:31:43.737
And you won't let me talk.
"Oh, Mom, please don't talk".

01:31:43.772 --> 01:31:46.120
Brian's the only one that let's me talk.
He's never here.

01:31:46.155 --> 01:31:48.005
I wanna talk before I die.

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:50.405
I do. I wanna be able
to say the things...

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.800
- I wanna say the deep thoughts... without you shushing me...
- Okay. Okay. What?

01:31:53.835 --> 01:31:56.600
- because what I say hurts you.
- Oh, Mom.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.640
Tired of being shushed.

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.000
What do you wanna say?

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:07.480
I already said everything
I wanna say.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.840
Except I'm sad.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:19.400
- Why?
- I'm sad that I won't be able to plan your wedding.

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.085
So promise me that you won't have
a ring bearer...

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.520
or a flower girl, because those kids
always just misbehave...

01:32:24.555 --> 01:32:27.160
and then they distract
from the bride.

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.760
And don't invite too many people.

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.920
- Well, you know, I might not even get married, so...
- Whatever.

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:41.040
If I knew that you would be happy,
I would close my eyes now.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.200
I would.

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.960
It's so much easier
to be happy, my love.

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:49.800
It's so much easier
to choose to love...

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.040
the things that you have.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.840
And you have so much...

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.260
instead of always yearning
for what you're missing...

01:32:58.295 --> 01:33:01.280
or what it is that
you're imagining you're missing.

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.640
It is so much more peaceful.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:14.400
Thank you. That's very nice.
You're-You're too kind. Stay that way.

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:17.960
You know what it is?
I found out today it takes six months...

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.800
What time is it?

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:29.600
I can't see the clock.
What time is it?

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.080
- It's 11:35. Uh-uh.
- Did Harold call yet?

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.480
Ellie, I need you to go get your father
and bring him home.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.160
Where?

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.440
Can I get another beer?

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:07.800
Okay. Yeah.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:32.480
Dad?

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.040
Tsk. Who's that?

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.520
Tsk. You weren't supposed
to see this.

01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:58.720
You shouldn't have, uh...

01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:05.400
I, uh... I...

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:12.520
He didn't, uh... I mean,
he didn't even remember my book.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.480
Didn't even remember it.

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.720
The narcissistic
son-of-a-bitch.

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:24.200
Thinks just 'cause he teaches
at Harvard, right?

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:29.080
He didn't even remember it.

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:34.520
- Let's go home. Mom's waiting.
- Ellen...

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.520
the first time
I saw your mother...

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:45.960
she was so filled with light.

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.400
She lit up everything
around her.

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.560
Even me.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:08.560
I just can't imagine
the light going out.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.280
I can't imagine it.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.480
- I think it's time to go home. Come on.
- Let me get...

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.440
Okay. Yeah.

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.000
Okay.

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:49.400
Harold?

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:53.640
Ellen. I-I-
I was gonna bring him, but...

01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.240
I was just gonna call.

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:58.600
Here. Let me. Let me.

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.600
Ice-cream monster.

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:32.000
- The ice-cream monster!
- The ice-cream monster!

01:37:32.035 --> 01:37:33.440
Good day.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:16.760
Your brother was back
at his new job in Cambridge...

01:38:16.795 --> 01:38:19.760
and your father was back
full time at the college.

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.280
Right.

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.120
So, you were responsible
for giving her her medicine?

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.480
Yeah.

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.920
Teresa! Teresa!

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.360
Teresa!

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:55.720
Mom! The nurse isn't here.
It's me. Are you okay?

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.360
- Oh, I'm fine.
- Well, do you need me to get you...

01:38:59.395 --> 01:39:01.080
I said I'm fine.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.200
I need you to help me.

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:18.320
I can't get up.

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:20.920
Oh, God!

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:22.720
Okay.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.920
Okay, come on.

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.640
Put your arm around me.
Up. Ready?

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.360
Ready?

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:36.320
Okay, lift. Put your arm around me.
Put your arm around me.

01:39:36.355 --> 01:39:37.600
Good.

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:43.400
Good. Okay, good.
Here we go. Here we go.

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:46.240
Okay.

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.160
Okay.

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:53.920
Okay.

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.445
I need a pill, Ellie.

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.840
It's not time yet. Can you wait?

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.000
No.

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.160
No. Please.

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:17.120
Oh, I don't wanna live like this.

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.600
Here.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.080
It'll be better tomorrow.

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:42.360
No, I won't. This is not living.
This isn't living.

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.280
Why can't...
this be over, baby?

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.960
Please help me.
You help me.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:57.960
You're my girl. You help me, please.
Ellie, promise me...

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.040
you'll help me.

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.760
Please. Please. Please.

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.960
We all made this
for you, honey.

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:13.280
See, it's got our names
all over it, embroidered.

01:41:13.315 --> 01:41:16.120
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- I hope you like it.

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.760
What's that smell? It's that
Indian summer potpourri, isn't it?

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:23.160
Mm-hmm.
It's your favorite.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.240
Who's making
a racket out there?

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:28.640
She brought the baby.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.520
You girls do good work,
you know?

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:35.760
Are you available next Tuesday?

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:39.165
- Oh, here he is.
- He says, "I want Kate".

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.565
- Where's Kate? There she is.
- Oh, I thought I never...

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:44.960
- Oh, hello, little man. Oh, my gosh.
- Can you sit down for me?

01:41:44.995 --> 01:41:47.320
Oh, gosh.
Who's that cute baby?

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.120
Ellen, I...

01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:59.360
I'm so sorry.
I know it must be very hard...

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:02.080
for you seeing her like this.

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.160
It's okay.

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.920
It'll be over soon.

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.640
I have a bib too.

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.960
I do remember telling Mrs. Best...

01:44:17.995 --> 01:44:20.320
that it would all be over soon.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.880
But everyone knew that.

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:27.560
Ellen...

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:31.920
did your mother ever ask you
to help her out of her pain?

01:44:31.955 --> 01:44:35.040
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I gave her
her medication every day.

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.960
No.

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.440
Did your mother ever ask you...

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.120
to help her take her life?

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:52.240
If she did, Ellen, I can say with
some assurance no one in this office...

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.720
I did not help my mother
take her life.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.520
Where was your father
on that last night?

01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:04.800
He had a class.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.160
He didn't come home
until she was already sleeping.

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:17.880
- George.
- Yeah.

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.880
- You came home so early.
- They cancelled my class.

01:45:20.915 --> 01:45:22.080
Oh.

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.840
Hi, you pretty girl.

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.040
Did you miss me?

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.600
Oh, no.

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.680
I want to talk to George now.

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.080
Did you feed her?

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.800
No one should have
to live like that.

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:30.400
No one.

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.600
Mom said that.

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:39.320
She was right.

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.400
Hey.

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:20.880
I finished the table.

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:40.840
Love you, Ellie.

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.880
I love you.

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.160
I knew that.

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.280
I always knew that.

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.000
Take care, sweetie.

01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:51.880
El?

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.680
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:00.520
Hi.

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.280
I'm so sorry.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.280
I don't know what else to say.

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.960
I'm so sorry.

01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:19.120
How are you?

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:21.160
Yeah. You okay?

01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:26.040
Never knew I could
miss someone so much.

01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:27.600
Oh, God.

01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:30.240
I know.
I missed you too.

01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:39.160
I know this isn't really
a good time to talk, but...

01:50:39.195 --> 01:50:41.525
you know, when you're ready,
we should...

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:45.240
we should figure out what we're
going to do this year, you know.

01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:49.205
that you just don't understand.

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.440
And I'm sorry, but I don't think
you can understand.

01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:54.700
What? What are you
talking about?

01:50:54.735 --> 01:50:56.800
- Thank you for coming.
- El?

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:09.840
Ellen...

01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:13.720
your mother died
of an overdose of morphine.

01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:18.800
Can you think of any possible
explanation for that?

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:26.200
Do you think your father might have
some idea how it might have happened?

01:52:26.235 --> 01:52:28.640
I really don't know
how he could.

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:32.440
Like I said, he didn't come home
until she was sleeping.

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.280
Have you discussed any of this
with your father?

01:52:36.315 --> 01:52:37.480
No.

01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:41.560
Well, only because I went back
to New York right after the funeral.

01:52:41.595 --> 01:52:43.480
And I really haven't talked
to him since then.

01:52:43.515 --> 01:52:45.840
I've been really busy.
New job.

01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:49.720
- You're writing again?
- Mm-hmm.

01:52:49.755 --> 01:52:51.960
Feature writer for the Voice.

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.720
Hmph.
Congratulations.

01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:57.800
Thanks.

01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:03.720
I may want to speak to your father.

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:07.960
Anyway...

01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.920
thank you.

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.120
Sure.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.920
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:53:20.955 --> 01:53:22.400
Thank you.

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:05.840
How long have you been here?

01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:07.480
Not long.

01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:13.760
I can smell the lilacs
and the hollyhocks under the soil.

01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:20.760
Your mother used to say
she could do the same thing.

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:25.600
How'd it go today?

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.560
All right, I guess.

01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:31.120
He's gonna want
to talk to you too.

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:37.480
Ellen, I just want you to know
how much I admire your courage.

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.200
And I wish I'd done it.

01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:43.800
What?

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:46.520
I wish I had.

01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.200
I would've.

01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:57.400
Couldn't.

01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:06.960
Dad, I didn't do it.

01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:10.360
I didn't do it.
I thought that...

01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:14.560
All this time,
I thought that it was you.

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:22.920
- Oh, my God.
- No.

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:26.680
- It's impossible.
- Oh, my God.

01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:29.880
She was too helpless.
She was too frail.

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:39.680
The pills.

01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:42.080
How could sh...? Jesus.

01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:50.240
Ellen, I...

01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:54.440
I love your mother.

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:07.720
I don't suppose
I'm ever going to stop loving her.

01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:15.200
But because she can do anything...

01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:18.920
run the house, run our lives...

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.840
keep everything
so beautiful and so warm...

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:31.760
I only thought
of what she meant to me.

01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:33.480
My... muse.

01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:39.040
My... lovely wife.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.800
My one true thing.

01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:51.160
Of course she did it.

01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:54.640
Who else would've had
the strength?

01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:24.440
No, you have to go
deeper than that.

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:26.920
You have to go four inches.

01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:30.800
- Four?
- Yeah.

01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:36.280
Yeah, so that they don't rot in the snow,
or so that the animals don't get them.

01:57:36.315 --> 01:57:37.640
Uh-huh.

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.720
And then four inches apart
so that the roots don't tangle...

01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:44.880
and they'll just
look prettier.

01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:50.240
What are these plants?

01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:52.160
Daffodils.

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:54.920
- These are daffodils?
- Yeah.
