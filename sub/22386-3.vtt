misses the basket.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.039

02:49.470 --> 02:50.569
What happened?

02:50.571 --> 02:53.472
<i> I was up on the cliff trying</i>
<i> to take booby bird pictures,</i>

02:53.474 --> 02:56.208
<i> when I fell into</i>
<i> a pirate's hide-out.</i>

<i> completely</i>

<i> unquestionably confident</i>

<i> I could maybe possibly perhaps</i>
<i> have fallen</i>

<i> into the lost lair of the</i>

03:05.419 --> 03:06.985

04:03.010 --> 04:03.875
(Bird squawking)

04:03.877 --> 04:05.510
--when he fell into
a hidden cavern.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.712
A hidden cavern?

04:06.714 --> 04:09.615
Yeah, a cabin filled
with pirate stuff.

04:09.617 --> 04:13.385
He even thinks it might belong
to Captain Blackfur.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.286
Blackfur?

04:14.288 --> 04:17.289

04:17.291 --> 04:18.123
Exactly!

04:18.125 --> 04:20.959

knows what he looked like,

04:20.961 --> 04:22.861

his treasure.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.109

And then... Rubble!

04:39.747 --> 04:40.612

we need to dig in the cavern.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.053
The rest of you pups,
stand by.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.655

06:34.395 --> 06:36.395
Look what I found!

06:36.397 --> 06:40.265
Cool, an old pirate
spyglass.

Wait, if this cave
really was Blackfur's hide-out,

06:44.605 --> 06:47.005
how did he get all this stuff
in here?

06:47.007 --> 06:47.939
Good question!

06:47.941 --> 06:50.108
There has to be another easier
way out of here.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.278
Like a tunnel
of some sort.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.146

we need you down here!

Whoa, nice flag,

Hey, Rubble,
check this out!

07:39.760 --> 07:41.193
Whoa!

07:41.195 --> 07:42.661
A real pirate hat!

07:42.663 --> 07:45.630
That was on a real
pirate's head?

07:45.632 --> 07:46.698
Try it on.

(Sniffing)

08:02.249 --> 08:03.114
Sea water!

08:03.116 --> 08:05.484
That must be the way
to the beach!

08:05.486 --> 08:07.219
But we can't get out
through there.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.286
It's blocked!

08:08.288 --> 08:09.921
Rubble, you know
what to do.

08:09.923 --> 08:13.291
Arrr, stand back,
land-lubbers!

08:13.293 --> 08:16.661
Shovel! Woof!

08:17.664 --> 08:20.732
This is going to take a while.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.402
Woof, woof!

08:24.404 --> 08:25.370
Phew!

08:25.372 --> 08:28.740
All that's left is to move
that big boulder.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.575
(Distant waves crashing)

08:30.577 --> 08:31.743
I hear waves.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.012
We'd better get Zuma to tell us
what it looks like

08:34.014 --> 08:35.580
from the beach side.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.516
Zuma, I need you to come
to the--

08:37.518 --> 08:38.850
<i> North Shore beach?</i>

08:38.852 --> 08:40.452
On my way, Ryder!

08:40.454 --> 08:42.153
I totally knew you'd call!

08:42.155 --> 08:44.222
It's all beach here, Ryder.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.658
You're going to come out
right on the sand.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.526
Go for it!

08:47.528 --> 08:51.463
All right, let's hit the beach!

08:51.465 --> 08:54.933
One, two, three, push!

08:54.935 --> 08:58.370
(All groaning)

08:58.372 --> 09:00.739
(Rumbling)

09:00.741 --> 09:01.806
Yeah!

09:01.808 --> 09:03.375
Ruff, ruff!
Wahoo!

09:03.377 --> 09:04.809
Ha, ha!

09:04.811 --> 09:06.611
Ugh!

09:06.613 --> 09:08.280
Whoa!

09:12.352 --> 09:14.085
(Spitting, coughing)

09:14.087 --> 09:15.820
Thanks, Rubble.

09:15.822 --> 09:16.821
No worries.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.490
Check out this old bottle.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.659
It looks like
there's something in it.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.595
A bottle with a message!
Yes!

09:23.597 --> 09:26.831
That must have been buried
in the tunnel.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.170
It looks like an old map.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.072
A pirate treasure map?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.040
Could be.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.108
But part of it's missing.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.877
There's no X to mark the spot

09:38.879 --> 09:40.845
where the treasure
should be buried.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.380
Looks like we've got a mystery.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.984
I need all paws on deck
to figure this one out!

09:45.986 --> 09:47.852
A pirate treasure map!

09:47.854 --> 09:48.920
(Howling excitedly)

09:48.922 --> 09:52.490
This could be our most
epic adventure ever!

10:10.811 --> 10:13.545
Did you really find
a treasure map?

10:13.547 --> 10:14.679
Yeah, check it out!

10:14.681 --> 10:18.717
Wow, I've never seen a real
treasure map before!

10:18.719 --> 10:22.921
Well, we won't know if it's real
until we find the treasure,

10:22.923 --> 10:24.789
and we won't find the treasure

10:24.791 --> 10:26.558
until we find the rest
of the map.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.759
What happened to the rest of it?

10:27.761 --> 10:31.529
Captain Blackfur hid
two more parts of the map.

10:31.531 --> 10:32.430
Listen!

10:32.432 --> 10:34.699
"A priceless treasure awaits ye

10:34.701 --> 10:38.770
who finds the map torn
into three."

10:38.772 --> 10:42.140
And look, there's a clue
to the next part of the map!

10:42.142 --> 10:44.442
"The part of the map
that you seek

10:44.444 --> 10:46.978
hides in the big parrot's beak."

10:46.980 --> 10:49.047
Big parrot?
In Adventure Bay?

10:49.049 --> 10:52.150
Hey, those boulders at the
bottom of Jake's mountain

10:52.152 --> 10:53.885
kind of look like a parrot.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.186
Yeah, let's check it out.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.288
(All barking, cheering)

10:57.290 --> 11:00.558
Okay, pups, let's see
what we can find.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.960
Uh...

11:01.962 --> 11:06.564
¶

11:06.566 --> 11:10.035
I'll stay here and watch over
the pirate property!

11:10.037 --> 11:12.070
Good luck!

11:12.072 --> 11:12.904
(Sighing)

11:12.906 --> 11:22.180
Those pups get to have
all the fun.

11:27.587 --> 11:32.824
Ryder, I found the boulders
Rocky was talking about!

11:32.826 --> 11:35.427
They really do look like
a parrot!

11:35.429 --> 11:36.828
RYDER:
That's great, Skye!

11:36.830 --> 11:38.697
Any sign of a map?

11:38.699 --> 11:41.232
Hang on, I'll have a look!

11:44.705 --> 11:46.471
(Squawking)

11:46.473 --> 11:48.940
What's that?

11:48.942 --> 11:50.008
(Squawking)

11:50.010 --> 11:51.876
Uh-oh, the giant eagle!

11:51.878 --> 11:54.779
He's not looking at me.

11:54.781 --> 11:55.613
(Gasping)

11:55.615 --> 11:57.949
It's after that little bunny!

11:57.951 --> 12:02.654
(Barking)
Wings!

12:02.656 --> 12:06.725
This pup's gotta fly!

12:06.727 --> 12:09.527
(Howling)

12:09.529 --> 12:13.631
(Eagle squawking)

12:13.633 --> 12:15.900
Catch me if you can!

12:22.142 --> 12:23.675
Run, bunny, run!

12:23.677 --> 12:26.911
(Eagle squawking)

12:28.115 --> 12:30.181
Yikes!

12:30.183 --> 12:32.317
Fly, Skye, fly!

12:32.319 --> 12:34.085
(Squawking)

12:34.087 --> 12:36.521
Whoa! Oh!

12:36.523 --> 12:39.791
Whoa!

12:39.793 --> 12:41.960
(Eagle squawking)

12:41.962 --> 12:44.729
Ruff, ruff!

12:44.731 --> 12:46.698
I did it!

12:51.004 --> 12:52.670
Great job, Skye.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.539
Aw, thanks, Ryder!

12:54.541 --> 12:59.377
Now, let's see if we can
find that map!

12:59.379 --> 13:02.180
(Sniffing)

13:05.218 --> 13:09.654
Didn't the clue say
"in the parrot's beak"?

13:09.656 --> 13:12.857
Is that the map, Skye?

13:12.859 --> 13:14.893
It's another bottle!

13:14.895 --> 13:19.030
Maybe a piece of the map
is inside!

13:22.435 --> 13:23.935
Argh!

13:23.937 --> 13:25.303
Ahh!

13:25.305 --> 13:26.805
Ryder, look out below!

13:26.807 --> 13:28.473
Got it!

13:28.475 --> 13:29.607
There's more map in here.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.810
Does X mark the treasure spot?

13:31.812 --> 13:33.611
Does it? Does it?

13:33.613 --> 13:35.146
No X.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.414
PUPS:
Aww!

13:36.416 --> 13:40.618
The clue said there are
three pieces, remember?

13:40.620 --> 13:41.653
Rocky, tape!

13:41.655 --> 13:46.925
Coming up!
Ruff, tape!

13:46.927 --> 13:48.159
Perfect!

13:48.161 --> 13:49.527
It is part of the map,

13:49.529 --> 13:51.596
and there's another clue!

13:51.598 --> 13:54.699
"From atop Parrot Rock,
look toward the sea.

13:54.701 --> 13:58.102
A clue hides in the hollow
of a very big tree."

13:58.104 --> 14:02.607
If we can solve that clue,
we should find the treasure.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.576
(Pups barking excitedly)

14:04.578 --> 14:08.546
But there are a lot of big trees
in Adventure Bay.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.682
The biggest trees around
are in the forest

14:10.684 --> 14:12.283
where little Hootie lives.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.618
Good thinking, Chase.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.587
Then, let's go check them out!

14:15.589 --> 14:19.057
Arrr! We're gonna find
some treasure!

14:19.059 --> 14:21.926
Hey, wait for me!

14:27.767 --> 14:29.667
These trees are huge!

14:29.669 --> 14:31.536
And lots of them
have knotholes.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.338
I'm going to the find
the rest of

14:33.340 --> 14:37.041
Captain Blackfur's map!
Arrr!

14:39.446 --> 14:40.712
(Sniffing)

14:40.714 --> 14:42.013
Ooh, ooh, yuck!

14:42.015 --> 14:46.050
Uh, Rubble,
don't you mean "arrr"?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.553
Nope!

14:48.555 --> 14:52.156
Yuck, yuck, yuck!
Spider!

14:52.158 --> 14:54.025
(Giggling)

14:54.027 --> 14:57.061
(Barking)
Spider tool!

14:59.432 --> 15:04.636
No clues in there,
just a family of spiders.

15:04.638 --> 15:07.472
Ew, spider cooties!

15:10.176 --> 15:11.910
Ah-choo!

15:11.912 --> 15:13.311
Oof!

15:13.313 --> 15:15.680
Not in there, either.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.749
Just dust.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.784
Hee, hee!

15:19.786 --> 15:22.053
(Sirens blaring)

15:22.055 --> 15:23.788
How's it going?

15:23.790 --> 15:26.324
We're up to our tails
in trees!

15:26.326 --> 15:28.459
Hoo, hoo, hoo!

15:28.461 --> 15:29.894
Hi, little Hootie!

15:29.896 --> 15:31.062
Hoo, hoo!

15:31.064 --> 15:32.330
Have you seen an old bottle

15:32.332 --> 15:33.865
in the knothole of
any of these trees?

15:33.867 --> 15:37.368
Hoo, hoo!

15:40.674 --> 15:41.606
Hoo!

15:41.608 --> 15:43.207
Little Hootie says
it's in there.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.575
MARSHALL:
I'm on it!

15:44.577 --> 15:47.412
(Siren blaring)

15:47.414 --> 15:48.680
(Barking)

15:48.682 --> 15:50.682
Ladder!

15:50.684 --> 15:52.750
Here I come!

15:52.752 --> 15:55.853
Yes, little Hootie was right!

15:55.855 --> 15:57.188
(Cheering)

15:57.190 --> 16:00.325
Thanks, little Hootie.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.926
See you soon!

16:01.928 --> 16:03.695
Hoo, hoo!

16:03.697 --> 16:05.063
Bye!

16:05.065 --> 16:06.898
Whoa, whoa!

16:06.900 --> 16:08.299
Oh, ah, ooh!

16:08.301 --> 16:11.369
(Gasping)

16:11.371 --> 16:13.237
I caught it!

16:13.239 --> 16:15.073
Nice catch too, Ryder.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.774
(Laughing)

16:16.776 --> 16:18.643
Nice job, Marshall!

16:18.645 --> 16:20.144
What is it?
What is it?

16:20.146 --> 16:21.879
If this is the third piece
of the map,

16:21.881 --> 16:23.748
it should fit with
the second piece.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.350
I've got it, Ryder!

16:25.352 --> 16:28.820
Woof, tape!

16:28.822 --> 16:30.154
Thanks, Rocky!

16:30.156 --> 16:31.622
Now we have the whole map,

16:31.624 --> 16:33.791
and guess what else
is on here?

16:33.793 --> 16:36.227
X! X marks the spot!

16:36.229 --> 16:37.628
Whoo-hoo!

16:37.630 --> 16:39.097
I mean, arrr!

16:39.099 --> 16:41.833
Let's find the pirate treasure!

16:41.835 --> 16:43.368
(All laughing)

16:43.370 --> 16:45.403
First I have to read the clue.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.438
"Walk 20 paces from the tree,

16:47.440 --> 16:50.641
toward setting sun
and rising sea."

16:50.643 --> 16:52.110
What's that mean?

16:52.112 --> 16:54.846
Well, the sun sets that way,
over the sea.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.949
So, I walk 20 steps
in that direction.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.884
And we'll find the treasure!

16:59.886 --> 17:01.319
Here it goes.

17:01.321 --> 17:05.323
One, two, three, four, five,

17:05.325 --> 17:09.227
six, seven, eight, nine--

17:09.229 --> 17:10.094
Whoa!

17:10.096 --> 17:13.131
Whoa doesn't come after nine,
ten does!

17:13.133 --> 17:17.969
If I took step 10,
I'd fall right into the ocean.

17:17.971 --> 17:20.838
Oh, the map must be wrong.

17:20.840 --> 17:24.809
Or the pirates took
teeny, tiny steps.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.210
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

17:26.212 --> 17:28.746
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17--
Oh!

17:28.748 --> 17:31.349
Whoa!

17:31.351 --> 17:32.784
Ugh!

17:32.786 --> 17:33.918
Close one.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.853
Sorry, I got twinkle-toed
away.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.656
There's something out there,

17:38.658 --> 17:40.858
but it's hard to see
with all the fog in the way.

17:40.860 --> 17:46.431
Do you think it's mysterious
Captain Blackfur's old ship?

17:46.433 --> 17:48.132
Let's find out!

17:48.134 --> 17:50.101
Ruff, ruff! Wings!

17:55.075 --> 17:57.408
<i> It's a pirate ship for sure,</i>
<i> Ryder!</i>

17:57.410 --> 17:59.143
<i> I can see the flag!</i>

17:59.145 --> 18:01.779
<i> Can we go see if there's</i>
<i> treasure on it?</i>

18:01.781 --> 18:04.082
That old ship is falling apart.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.516
It's not safe.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.285
We need to get it on land, fast,

18:07.287 --> 18:10.955
before the tide comes in and
the waves break it into pieces.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.424
Arrrr, then let's bring 'er in!

18:13.426 --> 18:14.926
The ship's pretty big,

18:14.928 --> 18:18.629
but if we all work together,
maybe we can do it.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.432
(All cheering)

18:24.671 --> 18:26.370
The channel is done!

18:26.372 --> 18:29.707
Now, we can drag the boat
right up the beach.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.042
My forklift is set!

18:31.044 --> 18:33.444
Winch is ready
when Ryder is!

18:33.446 --> 18:35.513
All set!

18:43.990 --> 18:45.923
That's my signal!

18:45.925 --> 18:48.826
Woof, winch on!

18:48.828 --> 18:52.597
(Ship creaking)

18:52.599 --> 18:53.531
We did it!

18:53.533 --> 18:55.566
It's working!
How's it look up there, Skye?

18:55.568 --> 18:59.670
Steady as she goes!

18:59.672 --> 19:00.671
Whoa!

19:00.673 --> 19:01.806
Look at the anchor chain.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.808
The anchor must be caught!

19:03.810 --> 19:05.943
(Tires revving)

19:05.945 --> 19:08.846
Something's wrong.

19:08.848 --> 19:12.817
Let's see if we can
free that anchor.

19:13.686 --> 19:18.990
¶

19:18.992 --> 19:21.859
(Chain rattling)

19:29.936 --> 19:31.068
Ruff!

19:31.070 --> 19:33.304
(Whirring)

19:33.306 --> 19:35.740
(Chain rattling)

19:35.742 --> 19:37.742
They got it free! Yes!

19:37.744 --> 19:39.577
Here comes the ship!

19:39.579 --> 19:40.745
(Pups barking)

19:40.747 --> 19:45.883
Look, it's like
she's sailing again!

19:45.885 --> 19:47.418
Want to take a ride?

19:47.420 --> 19:49.187
Let's do it!

19:54.460 --> 19:58.162
Ahoy, land-lubbers!
It's Captain Blackfur!

19:58.164 --> 20:00.097
(Cheering)

20:00.099 --> 20:01.799
Yay!

20:01.801 --> 20:02.733
Ahem-hem!

20:02.735 --> 20:04.735
As mayor of Adventure Bay,

20:04.737 --> 20:07.038
I am thrilled and proud to play

20:07.040 --> 20:09.574
such a very, very, very
important part

20:09.576 --> 20:13.978
in solving the mystery of
the pirate Captain Blackfur!

20:13.980 --> 20:15.112
(Clucking)

20:15.114 --> 20:16.180
(Laughing)

20:16.182 --> 20:18.916
Okay, everyone, let's see
what's in the ship.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.252
(Cheering, barking)

20:21.254 --> 20:23.254
Marshall, put up your ladder!

20:23.256 --> 20:24.922
Aye-aye, Ryder.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.858
Cap'n Turbot,
can you give me a hand?

20:27.860 --> 20:30.228
Sure thing, Ryder!

20:30.230 --> 20:31.529
Let's go!

20:31.531 --> 20:32.730
Ruff, ruff

20:32.732 --> 20:34.832
Hooray!
Wahoo!

20:34.834 --> 20:36.500
(Pups cheering)

20:36.502 --> 20:38.803
Arrr! I can't wait!

20:38.805 --> 20:39.804
Me neither!

20:39.806 --> 20:42.640
What do you think
the treasure could be?

20:42.642 --> 20:44.742
(Grunting)

20:44.744 --> 20:45.643
Wow!

20:45.645 --> 20:47.645
A real treasure!
Pirate booty!

20:47.647 --> 20:48.613
Thanks, Captain.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.281
Thank you for saving me
from that cave!

20:50.283 --> 20:53.217
Whenever there's a problem,
just yelp--

20:53.219 --> 20:55.453
or "arrr!" for help.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.587
(Laughing)

20:56.589 --> 20:58.055
Yeah, open it, Ryder!

20:58.057 --> 20:58.889
Open it!

20:58.891 --> 21:01.025
Yeah, let's see
what's inside!

21:01.027 --> 21:02.026
(Grunting)

21:02.028 --> 21:03.527
Sorry, it's locked.

21:03.529 --> 21:06.197
I've got this! Arf!

21:11.304 --> 21:13.037
(Lid creaking)

21:13.039 --> 21:14.205
Awesome!

21:14.207 --> 21:15.273
Whoa!

21:15.275 --> 21:17.441
Awesome!

21:17.443 --> 21:19.243
A gold dog bone!

21:19.245 --> 21:21.078
Cool!

21:21.080 --> 21:22.480
(Coins jingling)

21:22.482 --> 21:25.116
Ah, not good for chewing,
though.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.584
A super fancy dog bowl!

21:26.586 --> 21:30.254
This must have belonged
to a super fancy pup.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.990
Why would a pirate captain
have a dog bowl?

21:32.992 --> 21:38.229
Maybe mysterious Captain
Blackfur had a faithful pup!

21:39.565 --> 21:41.766
No, that's why!

21:41.768 --> 21:42.500
Look!

21:42.502 --> 21:46.470
This is the mysterious
Captain Blackfur?

21:46.472 --> 21:50.041
It's not that the captain
had a pirate pup.

21:50.043 --> 21:52.576
The captain was a pirate pup!

21:52.578 --> 21:56.647
He looks just like me, except
for the black fur beard.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.515
Oh, wait, wait!

21:57.517 --> 22:01.419
This paper contains a prominent
pronouncement of the pirate pup.

22:01.421 --> 22:04.922
"He who finds this chest
my pirate command obey,

22:04.924 --> 22:10.227
and return this treasure to the
good people of Adventure Bay!"

22:10.229 --> 22:11.495
Like you!

22:11.497 --> 22:12.697
You're all good,

22:12.699 --> 22:15.333
every last pirate pup
of you!

22:15.335 --> 22:16.767
Arrr!

22:16.769 --> 22:18.202
Ahoy, land-lubbers!

22:18.204 --> 22:20.204
(Laughing, barking)

22:20.206 --> 22:22.173
¶ Arrr! ¶

22:22.175 --> 22:24.675
¶ You're all good pups ¶

22:24.677 --> 22:28.179
¶ And you saved the day ¶

22:28.181 --> 22:32.783
¶ Now it's time to play
'round Adventure Bay! ¶

22:32.785 --> 22:36.754
¶

22:36.756 --> 22:37.688
Huh?

22:37.690 --> 22:39.223
¶ Yo-ho-ho-ho, yo-ho ¶

22:39.225 --> 22:42.960
¶ Yo-ho-ho, yo-ho ¶

22:42.962 --> 22:45.996
Arrr, shiver me timbers!

22:45.998 --> 22:48.299
(Laughing)

22:51.537 --> 23:01.779
