Son, when you're young
and dating in New York,

00:19.228 --> 00:21.855
friend groups can become
pretty incestuous.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.066
Now, this is kind of a spoiler,

00:24.066 --> 00:26.735
but by the time I turned 40,

00:26.735 --> 00:29.947
I had kissed literally all of my friends.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.490
SOPHIE'S SON [phone]:
<i>Oh, Mom.</i>

00:31.490 --> 00:34.993
Please. Your theater camp pals
were just as horny

00:34.993 --> 00:37.162
and way less hot.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.540
And when things get weird enough, sometimes,

00:39.540 --> 00:42.417
you have to hit the reset button.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.212
SOPHIE'S SON:
<i>Wait. You even kissed Aunt Ellen?</i>

00:46.588 --> 00:48.841
Did... I... stutter?

00:49.883 --> 00:52.219
I still can't believe
someone bought my photo.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.554
Pinch me, Naomi!

00:54.304 --> 00:55.305
No.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.725
The couple that bought it wants
to have you over

00:58.725 --> 01:01.061
to their penthouse for dinner tonight
to hear about the piece.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.689
Oh, my God. Do I just, like, sell art

01:03.689 --> 01:06.316
and go to penthouses now? What is my life?

01:06.775 --> 01:09.111
This is how careers start, Sophie.

01:09.111 --> 01:11.738
The buyers brag to their rich friends
about meeting you.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.032
Those rich friends want to buy your work,
and boom.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.410
You're at the Met Gala
wearing a bird's nest as a hat.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.287
Okay, are there actual birds in the hat?

01:18.287 --> 01:19.663
Of course.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.665
They'll parody it on <i>SNL</i>.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.502
That's gonna be so embarrassing.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.881
Oh, and they want you
to bring your model to dinner.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.675
Cool. We're in.

01:31.675 --> 01:32.551
I'm out!

01:33.093 --> 01:36.847
Rich strangers summoning two unsuspecting
fools to their towers?

01:36.847 --> 01:39.433
The start of no less than,
like, five horror movies.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.603
Please. Th-they just wanna
ask us some questions.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.147
Oh, you mean exactly like
the plot of <i>The Questioning?</i>

01:45.147 --> 01:48.734
It's gonna be super fun.
They have a really nice penthouse...

01:48.734 --> 01:52.446
Hm, like Vera Farmiga and
Pablo Schreiber in <i>The Penthouse.</i>

01:52.446 --> 01:53.780
You ever heard of a book, bro?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.157
Oh, yeah! Like you've read a book.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.992
Oh, I own several.

01:56.992 --> 01:57.993
Uh-huh.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.329
- The point is...
- Mm-hmm?

02:00.829 --> 02:03.040
This could be big for my career.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.626
And friends help each other out.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.295
And that's what we are.
Friends. We're totally friends.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.922
The fact you keep
repeating we're friends

02:09.922 --> 02:11.507
makes me think
we're actually mortal enemies.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.842
I know that things are weird
between us right now,

02:13.842 --> 02:16.178
but if I have any points left with you,

02:17.888 --> 02:19.473
I'd like to cash them in.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.978
Fine. Fine. I'll go.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.316
For safety.
- You're not bringing that.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.193
You're right. It would totally
just get used against me.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.447
And I'm pretty sure that's everything.

02:35.447 --> 02:38.367
I didn't realize I kept
so much stuff here. What's in this?

02:38.367 --> 02:41.161
Uh, your air fryer and the cat toys

02:41.161 --> 02:43.247
that you play with when you're on shrooms.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.958
Ooh, it's fun when
I'm not on shrooms, too.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.920
Rachel and I have
a reservation for four at Bar Pacifica,

02:49.920 --> 02:51.672
but her friends just bailed
because they got

02:51.672 --> 02:54.007
last-minute tickets to
<i>The Musical.</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:57.052
<i>♪ Just when things couldn't be bleaker ♪</i>

02:57.052 --> 03:00.639
<i>♪ I made my best friend in a beaker ♪</i>

03:00.639 --> 03:03.725
<i>♪ Flubber, I love... ♪</i>

03:03.725 --> 03:06.395
Lin-Manuel Miranda
really needs to learn how to say no.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.314
Wait, you got into Bar Pacifica?

03:09.314 --> 03:10.941
If I find a date, can I come?

03:10.941 --> 03:13.861
Oh. You're ready
to get back out there, are you?

03:13.861 --> 03:16.363
Very cool? Fun.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.991
Do you really think
you can get a date by tonight?

03:18.991 --> 03:19.908
Got one!

03:20.450 --> 03:23.495
Wonderful. You know,
I actually also have that app.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.622
No.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.666
Yeah. As if.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.959
Eh, she'll do.

03:28.959 --> 03:29.960
Sweetie, that's my phone.

03:33.338 --> 03:37.217
Okay. So, in two weeks,
you come see me,

03:37.217 --> 03:38.927
which will cost us...

03:39.761 --> 03:42.639
Everything we have to our name.
- Let's just try miles.

03:43.182 --> 03:45.434
We have enough miles for...

03:46.143 --> 03:48.854
a subscription to
Delta's in-flight magazine.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.064
Ooh, wait. Is that my boy Josh Groban?
Good for him.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.276
Landing the cover of <i>Sky Magazine</i>.
Nice.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.612
I knew we shouldn't have
spent money on that banner.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.906
Hm...

03:59.865 --> 04:01.783
Hey, lovebirds!

04:01.783 --> 04:03.452
Good news.

04:03.452 --> 04:06.747
I have found a lovely woman on an app

04:06.747 --> 04:08.081
to go out with tonight.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.041
- Okay!
- Wow!

04:09.041 --> 04:11.043
Care to come with me
and make it a double?

04:11.043 --> 04:13.128
- Oh.
- Thanks, man, but we're, like,

04:13.128 --> 04:15.631
deep in long-distance
relationship logistics.

04:15.631 --> 04:18.383
I'm not just casually asking, am I?
I am begging.

04:20.344 --> 04:23.055
Please. I am hanging on
by an emotional thread right now,

04:23.055 --> 04:25.807
and a one-on-one dinner
with a complete stranger might break me.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.227
What if she doesn't ask me any questions?

04:28.227 --> 04:29.978
What if she asks me too many questions?

04:29.978 --> 04:32.898
What if her answers to my questions
aren't in the form of a question?

04:33.732 --> 04:36.193
- Okay, fine. We'll come.
- Brilliant! Thank you so much.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.111
Oh, my God. Is that Josh Groban?
He looks fantastic.

04:42.324 --> 04:43.617
Hello!

04:43.617 --> 04:45.953
You must be Sophie, the <i>artiste</i>.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.497
- Hm.
- That is me, isn't it?

04:48.497 --> 04:51.250
That would make you Jesse, the model.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.293
And that would make you...

04:53.293 --> 04:55.504
Warren, the rich guy.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.758
I am so rich.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.760
Please, come in.

05:03.345 --> 05:07.182
And this lovely woman
carrying the tray of bison carpaccio

05:07.182 --> 05:09.476
is my wife, Megan.
- Welcome.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.728
Let me know
if you need a bib for the blood.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.024
I'm sorry,
is-is that a-a platter of raw meat?

05:16.024 --> 05:19.361
Yes. The mouth-feel is so...

05:19.361 --> 05:22.489
Mm. Wet and sensual.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.617
- Yeah, um, th-that's, uh--
- So interesting!

05:25.617 --> 05:27.369
We'd love to try some.
- I'm good.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.329
Yeah, at trying new things.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.873
<i>Eat the bison, man.</i>

05:35.460 --> 05:36.962
Hm?
Hm.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.381
- Oh!
- Wow!

05:39.381 --> 05:41.383
<i>It's... just like sushi.</i>

05:43.093 --> 05:44.845
<i>But with more veins.</i>

05:45.596 --> 05:47.723
Way more veins.
- Mm-hmm.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.101
The chunky bits are actually cartilage.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.980
You know what?
Why don't I whip up

05:54.980 --> 05:57.232
you menfolk some Manhattans?

05:57.232 --> 05:58.525
Oh!

05:58.525 --> 06:00.110
I better go supervise,

06:00.110 --> 06:01.778
make sure she doesn't screw anything up.

06:02.613 --> 06:03.947
Women.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.707
Ah! Ah!

06:14.333 --> 06:17.961
Ah! This is <i>so much</i> worse
than <i>The Penthouse.</i>

06:17.961 --> 06:20.380
This is <i>The Penthouse Chapter 2:
The Penthousening.</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:21.590
Is that even a real movie?

06:21.590 --> 06:24.259
Nikki Hilton was in it, so... no.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.679
Okay. I know this is a little odd.

06:27.679 --> 06:30.015
Okay? But, w-we have to be nice
to these people, alright?

06:30.015 --> 06:33.060
Because after tonight,
I am gonna be one step closer

06:33.060 --> 06:34.478
to owning a bird hat.

06:34.478 --> 06:37.105
Okay, first of all, there's no way
a hat would stay on a bird.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.192
Secondly, we need
to get out of here, okay?

06:40.192 --> 06:43.612
Because Warren and Megan
are clearly cannibals.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.489
No, they're not.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.990
They're eccentric.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.825
Yeah, that's probably what this guy said

06:48.825 --> 06:51.286
right before we got turned
into an <i>amuse-bouche.</i>

06:54.206 --> 06:56.875
Hi.
Here for a reservation under Charlie.

06:58.043 --> 07:01.547
Hi. I'm Hannah. This is my husband, Sid.

07:01.547 --> 07:04.842
You must be Alice?
- Yes. Pleasure.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.593
Do you know if they give you
free bread here?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.054
Probably...

07:09.513 --> 07:11.098
<i>Famous last words.</i>

07:12.474 --> 07:14.893
Hey, so t-tell us
about yourself, Alice.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.270
Like, what do you-- what do you do?

07:16.270 --> 07:18.939
Oh. Uh, so I run
an airline rewards program.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.525
Hand out miles, change blackout dates.

07:21.525 --> 07:25.445
I'm basically Wizard of Oz of the sky.
Who's behind the curtain? Me.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.824
I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking
about this bread thing.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.037
Oh, my God.
She's the answer to all our problems.

07:34.037 --> 07:37.374
She and Charlie start dating.
She becomes part of the crew.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.793
She gives us all those sweet, sweet miles.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.421
Mm. Bam. Love that.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.964
One problem.
- Hm?

07:44.715 --> 07:47.342
She is... <i>really</i> weird.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.429
No, she isn't. She's amazing.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.598
You hear me? She's <i>amazing</i>.

07:52.598 --> 07:53.599
Oh.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.642
Okay.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.769
Hey, guys.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.731
What?

08:00.731 --> 08:02.482
Oh, is this too much?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.276
Oh, what am I talking about?
Of course, it's too much.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.862
No one in this godforsaken country
wears suits.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.906
Look, I think tonight was a mistake.

08:08.906 --> 08:11.158
I'm not ready, so if you can
just tell her that I'm sorry--

08:11.158 --> 08:13.577
I am not telling her sorry.
I am telling you

08:13.577 --> 08:15.037
congratulations, Charlie.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.955
'Cause <i>we</i> just met Alice,

08:16.955 --> 08:19.208
and she is... wow.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.126
- Really?
- Wow!

08:21.126 --> 08:24.171
Yeah. She is a <i>triumph</i> of a woman.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.589
Ooh!

08:25.589 --> 08:26.590
Oh.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.801
I'm not sharing. Finders keepers.

08:33.055 --> 08:36.558
Your photograph spoke to us
on a very deep level.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.601
Oh!

08:38.393 --> 08:40.729
What can I say? That's what I do.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.731
Because it featured Jesse.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.817
- What?
- Rolling up your sleeves,

08:45.817 --> 08:47.027
fixing that car.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.779
The way the light

08:48.779 --> 08:51.198
hit your forearms, it was just so...

08:51.698 --> 08:54.409
Hi! [nervous laugh] Hi.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.453
We just had to see you in person,

08:56.453 --> 08:58.497
and you do <i>not</i> disappoint.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.376
You are the perfect example
of the American male.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.087
To Jesse.
- To Jesse.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.797
And Sophie!

09:06.797 --> 09:07.798
Yay!

09:08.465 --> 09:12.427
Sure. Congratulations on capturing
what it means to be...

09:13.637 --> 09:15.639
a real man.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.936
Hm... Hm... Hm...

09:20.936 --> 09:22.896
So I don't think
they want to eat us.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.147
They wanna bang us.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.148
Us?

09:26.191 --> 09:27.442
You.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.369
Table for Ellen.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.579
RACHEL/VALENTINA:
Jinx.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.747
Jinx again.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.584
Triple jinx!

09:43.584 --> 09:45.961
This is going better
than I could have ever imagined!

09:45.961 --> 09:49.214
Look at us! Three gals, out on the town.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.049
Just jinxing like no one's watching.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.509
Oh look! There's my date!

09:52.509 --> 09:55.304
Val's date that night
was completely forgettable.

09:55.304 --> 09:59.099
I don't remember what he looked like
or what his name was.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.601
So, we'll just call him Rando.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.270
Everyone, this is Rando.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.605
How long have you guys been together?

10:04.605 --> 10:07.733
Ten seconds. I just got
out of a serious relationship,

10:07.733 --> 10:09.860
but I move on fast 'cause I'm an Aries.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.112
Yeah, right.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.573
W-what's funny about that?

10:15.407 --> 10:17.743
Oh. I-I thought you were kidding.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.620
You don't really believe
in that nonsense, right?

10:21.121 --> 10:23.624
If by "that nonsense,"
you mean my birth chart,

10:23.624 --> 10:26.668
beautifully drawn
by my psychic Madame Deborah?

10:27.336 --> 10:29.129
Yeah, I do.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.631
Uh,

10:30.631 --> 10:33.133
I guess because I'm studying
to be a psychologist,

10:33.133 --> 10:35.219
I just believe in <i>real</i> science.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.388
New topic!

10:38.388 --> 10:42.142
Let's all say our favorite
Arnold Schwarzenegger films.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.393
I'll start.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.729
I haven't seen any. Val?

10:45.729 --> 10:48.065
A psychologist, huh?

10:48.065 --> 10:51.443
So, you're what Madame Deborah would call
"a head-shrinking wackjob."

10:51.443 --> 10:55.239
Hey... Remember
when you guys triple-jinxed?

10:55.239 --> 10:58.200
That was such a great memory. Huh?

10:58.951 --> 11:00.744
Back at the host stand?

11:01.119 --> 11:02.788
Okay, so I'm gonna sprint home.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.206
No, no, no! You can't leave now.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.999
They're just putting out dinner.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.292
Just give me one more hour.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.045
Thirty minutes. And afterwards,
you're buying me a slice of pizza.

11:10.045 --> 11:13.048
- Fine.
- And a... small Coke?

11:13.590 --> 11:15.217
- Sure.
- Still got it.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.677
- Jesse!
- Uh-huh?

11:16.677 --> 11:17.678
Before we eat,

11:17.678 --> 11:20.305
Megan and I would love to give you
a tour of the house.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.307
Great. I'd love to see
where you hung my photo,

11:22.307 --> 11:24.268
and maybe point out some spots
where others could go.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.979
Oh, no talking on this tour.
Except for you, Jesse.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.438
<i>You</i> can speak.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.775
You can say anything. <i>Anything.</i>

11:34.736 --> 11:36.947
Short Line, Chance, Park Place,

11:36.947 --> 11:40.701
Luxury Tax, Boardwalk,
and that brings us back to Go.

11:40.701 --> 11:41.952
Wow.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.663
You really memorized
the entire Monopoly board!

11:44.663 --> 11:46.373
Isn't that cool, Charlie?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.875
Yeah, I suppose so.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.626
You're like a genius.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.211
Do you have a photographic memory?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.629
Oh, no.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.340
I just, uh, really made it a priority.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.011
Uh-oh. Anybody see
where the ladies' room is?

11:59.011 --> 12:01.138
These banana daiquiris
are going straight through me.

12:02.097 --> 12:05.017
You and me both, girlfriend.
I'll go with you.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.394
Boys, order us two more 'nana daqs.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.105
I hope we get stalls
right next to each other.

12:12.316 --> 12:14.067
I have to be honest,

12:14.067 --> 12:16.862
I'm not quite seeing what you
and Hannah is seeing in Alice.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.406
Yeah, well, that's just ridiculous

12:19.406 --> 12:22.159
because you guys got so much in common.
You're both...

12:22.159 --> 12:23.327
right-handed.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.829
Actually, I'm left-handed.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.874
Mother forced me to be right-handed
because she said the devil was in me.

12:28.874 --> 12:31.418
Still counts. <i>Garçon!</i>

12:31.418 --> 12:32.753
Four banana daiquiris.

12:32.753 --> 12:36.173
And here it is, Jesse. Your photo.

12:37.049 --> 12:39.259
I record all of my content in here,

12:39.259 --> 12:41.512
and it makes the perfect backdrop.

12:41.512 --> 12:43.847
Ooh. What's your content about?

12:43.847 --> 12:46.683
If I had to boil it down,
I'd say it's about

12:46.683 --> 12:50.145
how men in this country are under attack.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.776
A-a-and by under attack, you mean...

12:55.776 --> 12:58.028
There's a war against men.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.072
A men-ocide, if you will.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.698
I subscribe.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.618
I-I mean, I would subscribe if
I was allowed to have a phone.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.043
Have you ever considered
that maybe you hate therapy

13:13.043 --> 13:15.295
because you're scared
what you'd learn about yourself?

13:15.295 --> 13:18.006
Have <i>you</i> ever considered
that you're becoming a therapist

13:18.006 --> 13:19.842
because you wanna get paid
for lying on a couch?

13:19.842 --> 13:21.051
The patients lie on the couch.

13:21.051 --> 13:23.303
Oh, like you're never gonna
lie on the couch.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.221
Ellen!

13:24.805 --> 13:25.889
Jinx?

13:27.975 --> 13:29.601
Whose team are you on?

13:29.601 --> 13:31.812
Are you Team Science with your girlfriend,

13:31.812 --> 13:34.940
or are you Team Star Magic with Valentina

13:34.940 --> 13:36.942
and her street psychic Deborah?

13:36.942 --> 13:40.362
It's Madame Deborah,
and she has a tent!

13:41.655 --> 13:42.948
Whose side are you on?

13:42.948 --> 13:45.909
Um... Side...

13:48.453 --> 13:51.206
Who are we kidding?
She's never gonna be able to decide.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.834
Look at this table!
She ordered one of everything.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.920
Oh, I know.
I made her choose a movie last night,

13:56.920 --> 14:00.424
and we ended up watching a YouTube video
on how to decide what to watch.

14:00.424 --> 14:03.552
Classic Ellen.

14:03.969 --> 14:06.597
Yeah! I did do that!

14:06.597 --> 14:07.848
I can't pick for shit!

14:09.016 --> 14:11.810
Quick! What else don't we like about me?

14:13.228 --> 14:15.439
Alright. Who's hungry?

14:15.981 --> 14:17.691
Uh, we will be right in.
I'm just gonna take

14:17.691 --> 14:19.484
a quick photo of Jesse

14:19.484 --> 14:21.612
with his picture to...

14:21.612 --> 14:23.030
celebrate his manhood.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.032
Right. If she can figure out
how to use the flash,

14:25.032 --> 14:26.867
this... woman.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.786
That's a good one...

14:30.787 --> 14:32.831
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.333
Google him, google him, google him.

14:36.001 --> 14:39.588
<i>Ow! Outer space is hurting my period!</i>

14:40.964 --> 14:42.257
<i>After the break,</i>

14:42.257 --> 14:45.135
<i>is wiping your butt gay?</i>

14:46.136 --> 14:48.514
- That explains the smell.
- Oh.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.350
We really should have
put this together sooner.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.269
You are the perfect example
of the American male.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.563
Women!

14:57.064 --> 15:00.234
I am a prominent leader
in the Men's Rights movement.

15:00.234 --> 15:01.235
Really?

15:02.528 --> 15:03.904
Okay, the last one was on me.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.697
All I could think about
was how loud my crunching was.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.075
I can't believe that my photo

15:08.075 --> 15:10.410
is the face of the Men's Rights movement.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.247
Okay, well, <i>my</i> face is the <i>actual</i> face.

15:13.247 --> 15:14.248
So what are we gonna do?

15:14.248 --> 15:16.625
Okay, the way I see it,
we have two options.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.253
- Okay.
- Option one, we start a podcast

15:19.253 --> 15:21.046
combating Warren's disinformation,

15:21.046 --> 15:23.966
while <i>also</i> giving our hot takes
on celebrity hairstyles.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.592
Here are mine. Shawn Mendes, wig.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.593
Tom Holland, wig.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.596
Jason Statham.
Bald cap!

15:30.097 --> 15:31.098
What's option two?

15:31.098 --> 15:33.058
I'm gonna distract them.
You grab my photo.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.935
Okay, I pick that one. Alright?

15:34.935 --> 15:36.019
Do you think I'm wearing a wig?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.064
- I don't know. I've never seen it wet.
- Unbelievable.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.693
She brings her own toilet seat cover.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.319
Yeah. It's reusable.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.738
How cool is that?

15:46.738 --> 15:49.700
So, Alice...

15:50.951 --> 15:52.202
What do you like to do for fun?

15:52.703 --> 15:54.997
Uh, well, um...

15:56.248 --> 15:57.291
I really like dancing.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.754
Oh!

16:03.422 --> 16:06.341
- Okay!
- Oh yeah! Oh, get it, girl!

16:09.928 --> 16:11.221
No, I cannot do this anymore.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.349
I'm sorry. Alice, I'm not ready
to date anyone right now.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.145
And, to be honest with you,
even if I was...

16:19.688 --> 16:21.523
I'm not sure that you
and I are a good fit.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.483
- Charlie...
- And I just don't understand

16:23.483 --> 16:25.736
why you want me and Alice
to work so badly.

16:25.736 --> 16:29.198
Oh.
Yeah, uh, he's after my miles.

16:29.198 --> 16:32.367
Yeah, I-I could sense it
the second that we met.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.578
Is that true?

16:36.330 --> 16:38.123
Wow.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.375
Pimping me out for miles.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.085
How do you sleep at night?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.296
Yeah. How do you?

16:46.423 --> 16:48.675
Look, it's fine.
It happens to me all the time.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.261
Yeah, anyway, at least tonight
wasn't a total waste.

16:52.304 --> 16:53.972
'Cause I met my new best friend.

16:55.224 --> 16:56.725
Yeah, you did.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.561
Bathroom sisters for life.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.605
- Yeah!
- Alice? Let's roll.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.358
Yeah, we will.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.484
You wanna play Yahtzee at mine?

17:05.484 --> 17:07.236
- Yes!
- Thank God, I hope I get a Yahtzee.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.407
Hey, Warren.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.952
You have inspired me.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.161
I have decided

17:16.870 --> 17:19.289
to set aside my silly career

17:19.289 --> 17:22.459
and focus all of my energy
on finding a husband

17:22.459 --> 17:23.752
who can tell me what to do.

17:24.753 --> 17:27.840
That is the smartest thing
I've ever heard a woman say.

17:28.632 --> 17:31.176
You have got to be
the next guest on my podcast.

17:31.176 --> 17:34.972
Now, of course, all female guests
are required to wear bikinis, but...

17:35.973 --> 17:37.015
you're cool with that, right?

17:37.015 --> 17:40.018
Absolutely! I would <i>love</i>
to put on a swimsuit

17:40.018 --> 17:41.979
and tell other women
to quit their jobs!

17:41.979 --> 17:44.022
See? You just get it.

17:44.022 --> 17:47.067
And I love that you're
figuring it out this young.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.653
Before I met Warren, I wasted years

17:49.653 --> 17:51.405
as the mayor of Baltimore.

17:52.739 --> 17:53.782
What?

17:54.950 --> 17:56.451
You were mayor?

17:57.202 --> 17:58.871
And now, you just...

17:58.871 --> 18:01.582
plate raw meat
for <i>this</i> little bitch?

18:01.582 --> 18:02.583
What?

18:02.583 --> 18:04.501
Sorry, Warren, but you're a joke.

18:05.502 --> 18:09.047
I mean, men are up to their
thick, hairy necks in rights,

18:09.047 --> 18:12.551
and Jesse is not
the perfect masculine man.

18:12.551 --> 18:16.555
He can't even figure out how to
get that picture off your wall. Look.

18:18.599 --> 18:22.102
This is so disappointing.
Get that photo out of my house!

18:22.102 --> 18:23.478
I'm trying!

18:23.478 --> 18:26.899
And to think we almost had sex with you.

18:26.899 --> 18:27.900
Both of us?

18:27.900 --> 18:29.860
- No!
- No! Just him!

18:29.860 --> 18:31.278
That's what I thought...

18:35.908 --> 18:38.577
Come on.
What else do I do that's silly?

18:38.577 --> 18:40.329
Ellen, we've been doing this forever.

18:40.329 --> 18:43.207
Can we talk about something else?
- No.

18:43.207 --> 18:44.875
This is a thing
that we all enjoy talking about,

18:44.875 --> 18:46.502
and we will do it
until it's time to go home.

18:48.003 --> 18:50.047
Okay, I-I'll do one. Uh...

18:50.672 --> 18:52.382
before, when we were fighting,

18:52.382 --> 18:53.926
my heart was beating so fast,

18:53.926 --> 18:56.136
I thought I was gonna pass out.

18:58.639 --> 19:01.725
Ellen, is that really how you felt?

19:03.060 --> 19:04.686
I mean, k-kind of.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.899
It sounds like you have
some really big feelings

19:08.899 --> 19:11.235
around conflict that you need to unpack.

19:11.235 --> 19:13.362
Yeah. Seriously, El.

19:13.362 --> 19:16.240
Have you ever considered talking
to a psycholog...

19:18.575 --> 19:21.453
- Ha!
- Okay, fine.

19:21.453 --> 19:24.289
Some people have stuff that
can't be fixed by Madame Deborah.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.582
Thank you.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.501
This is so fun!

19:27.501 --> 19:28.502
Who?

19:30.546 --> 19:32.756
Rachel, Ellen, and Valentina

19:32.756 --> 19:35.425
never hung out as a trio again.

19:35.843 --> 19:38.011
But, on the upside, that night,

19:38.011 --> 19:41.139
Ellen went online
and found herself a therapist.

19:42.391 --> 19:45.686
I'll tell you how I screwed
that up for her another time.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.359
♪ soft music ♪

19:52.359 --> 19:53.861
Hey. Uh...

19:54.611 --> 19:56.029
Sorry about before.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.866
We acted like selfish jerks.

19:58.866 --> 20:02.035
And to make up for it,
we want you to have this.

20:03.537 --> 20:05.539
It's the perfect first-date outfit

20:05.539 --> 20:07.833
for when you're actually ready
to get back out there.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.960
Mm-hmm.
Dressy shirts show that you care,

20:09.960 --> 20:12.629
a pair of jeans so you don't look
like you're trying too hard,

20:12.629 --> 20:15.674
and a pair of tighty-whities because,
brother, I know you can pull it off.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.676
Well, thank you.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.721
Wait, what happened
after you left with Alice?

20:22.306 --> 20:24.850
I got enough miles
for the next few months.

20:25.976 --> 20:26.977
Don't ask me how.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.520
No, go on. How?

20:28.520 --> 20:30.397
She said don't ask her how!

20:31.398 --> 20:33.525
Did we just eat raw bison

20:33.525 --> 20:36.528
to appease the leader
of the Men's Rights movement?

20:36.528 --> 20:38.906
I'm not ready to talk about the bison.

20:38.906 --> 20:41.200
Hey, to be fair, we don't know
that he's their leader.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.452
You know, there might be
somebody above him, and then...

20:43.452 --> 20:45.245
maybe you can
sell your photo to that guy.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.957
Okay.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.376
I'm definitely not getting
a bird hat off of tonight.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.669
No.

20:53.086 --> 20:56.215
But we work well together.
As friends.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.011
Yeah, I-I couldn't agree more.

21:02.971 --> 21:05.599
Hey, so if-if I had known,

21:05.599 --> 21:07.809
uh, you were
gonna come back that night,

21:07.809 --> 21:09.394
I wouldn't have called Meredith.

21:10.687 --> 21:11.897
The thing is--

21:11.897 --> 21:13.315
Jesse, just stop. It's...

21:14.441 --> 21:15.817
I get it.

21:16.735 --> 21:19.112
She's the love of your life, and...

21:20.030 --> 21:22.282
you've gotta give it a shot.

21:22.741 --> 21:25.244
And that's how we hit the reset button.

21:28.789 --> 21:29.790
Sort of.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.336
Uh, this is Meredith.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.046
You mind if I take this
before we get on the subway?

21:36.046 --> 21:38.006
No problem. Yeah, I'll wait.

SOPHIE'S SON:
<i>But if you lost the photo,
how did it end up back here?</i>

21:55.691 --> 21:58.694
Ah. A story for another time, kid.

21:58.694 --> 22:00.863
But trust me, I will get to it.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.158
- Hey.
- Hey. How was your night?

22:05.158 --> 22:06.243
Eh.

22:06.243 --> 22:08.829
I found out I sold my photo
to a hatemonger,

22:08.829 --> 22:10.581
and then a taxi drove away with it.

22:10.581 --> 22:13.208
So, the usual. How about you?

22:13.208 --> 22:15.335
Same. The usual.

22:17.838 --> 22:19.673
Rando!

22:23.343 --> 22:24.511
Damn!

22:24.511 --> 22:25.762
What is your secret?

22:26.555 --> 22:29.391
How are you able to move on
from Charlie so fast?

22:29.391 --> 22:32.019
I always bounce back quickly with guys.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.397

You were in love with him.

22:36.857 --> 22:39.443
Okay, fine.

22:39.443 --> 22:41.236
The truth is I realized something.

22:41.236 --> 22:43.197
Charlie and I are gonna end up together.

22:43.197 --> 22:44.781
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.783
I mean, sure, we want
different things right now,

22:46.783 --> 22:48.285
but life is long,

22:48.285 --> 22:51.079
and eventually, somehow, it'll work out.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.749
So, you're not worried
about him meeting someone else?

22:53.749 --> 22:55.042
No.

22:55.042 --> 22:57.169
Besides, if I know Charlie,

22:57.169 --> 22:59.588
it's gonna be a long time
before he gets back out there.
