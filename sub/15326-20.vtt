TAKING THESE SUITCASES UPSTAIRS?

01:40.266 --> 01:42.727
I'VE GOT TWO WEEKS
OF SHOWS TO CATCH UP ON.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.604

LIKE A QUESTION.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.731
IT WASN'T.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.233
- YES, MOM.

A GREAT VACATION.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.831
- ACTUALLY,
IT WAS ONLY HALF VACATION.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.875
IT WAS ALSO HALF JOB INTERVIEW.

02:05.959 --> 02:06.668
AND THAT WENT GREAT TOO.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.919
- JOB INTERVIEW?

02:09.002 --> 02:11.464
WHAT KIND OF JOB WOULD
YOU DO IN MOZAMBIQUE?

I'LL HAVE TO COMMIT
TO LIVING THERE FOR A YEAR,

OF POSITION YOU TURN DOWN.

COME BACK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE?

MAYBE FOR THE
KIDS' BIRTHDAYS, RIGHT?

02:26.145 --> 02:28.398
- ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING MAYBE
YOU COULD COME THERE

02:28.481 --> 02:30.692
FOR THE KIDS' BIRTHDAYS...

02:30.775 --> 02:31.734
BECAUSE I'D LIKE
TO TAKE THEM WITH ME.

06:48.908 --> 06:49.992
- HOW WOULD WE DO THAT?

07:37.415 --> 07:39.292

07:41.878 --> 07:44.714
IT'S A DEEPER
UNDERSTANDING.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.465

07:46.549 --> 07:48.509
OF YOU FINDING ME A CLOWN,
IS IT?

07:48.593 --> 07:50.178

WANT A CLOWN.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.345
AND OUR CLIENTS HAVE MONEY.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.388

07:52.471 --> 07:54.557
AND I WANT THAT MONEY.

FOR A ONE-YEAR-OLD.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.475
WHY WOULD SHE NEED A CLOWN?

07:56.559 --> 07:59.896
SHE JUST DISCOVERED
HER OWN FEET.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.106
- STEPH,
WHAT IS OUR BUSINESS MOTTO?

08:02.190 --> 08:05.902
- "NO DRINKING ON THE JOB."

08:05.985 --> 08:07.695
- OUR OTHER MOTTO.

08:07.778 --> 08:12.867
- "PARTIES ARE WAR,
AND WE WANT THAT MONEY."

08:12.950 --> 08:14.744
THAT COULD BE SNAPPIER.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.121
- FIRST,
LAND ME THAT CLOWN.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.499
THEN I'LL CRACK OPEN
THE SUGGESTION BOX.

09:10.258 --> 09:13.552
LEAVE THE COUNTRY
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.555
- MOM, NOW IS NOT
THE BEST TIME.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.848
- AND WHY NOT?

09:17.932 --> 09:21.227
- [grunts]

09:21.310 --> 09:23.771
- YOUR BOOK CLUB CAN WAIT.

09:25.731 --> 09:26.983
NOW, WHAT
ABOUT THOSE KIDS?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.734
- THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.319
CHARLIE SAYS THE BEST THING
FOR THEM

09:30.403 --> 09:32.572
IS TO STIFLE OUR FEELINGS
AND SUPPORT KIM.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.157
- CHARLIE IS A LOVING FATHER,

09:35.241 --> 09:36.450
A BRILLIANT SURGEON,

09:36.534 --> 09:39.954
BUT IN THIS CASE,
HE A FOOL.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.625
NOW YOU CANNOT
JUST STAND IDLY BY

09:44.709 --> 09:47.837
AND WATCH YOUR CHILDREN
BE DRAGGED HALFWAY

09:47.920 --> 09:50.172
AROUND THE WORLD BY
SOME STRANGE WOMAN.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.050
- SHE'S THEIR MOTHER.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.052
AND IT'S HER TURN
TO HAVE THEM.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.095
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

09:56.178 --> 09:57.722
I HAVE SOME INTERVIEWS
TO CONDUCT.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.934
- STEPHANIE,

10:02.018 --> 10:03.644
YOUR CHILDREN ARE LEAVING
THE COUNTRY.

10:03.728 --> 10:07.732
NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO JOIN THE CIRCUS!

10:10.401 --> 10:12.528
- EXCUSE ME, LADY.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.322
YOU NEED TO REFILL
THE FRUIT BOWL.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.700
MY AGENT PROMISED ME
A THREE-BANANA GUARANTEE.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.744
- WELL, YOU CAN'T ALWAYS HAVE
WHAT YOU WANT.

10:19.827 --> 10:23.873
SOMETIMES SOMEONE DROPS BANANAS
ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.374
AND THEN A YEAR GOES BY,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.043
AND YOU CAN'T IMAGINE YOUR
TABLE WITHOUT THOSE BANANAS.

10:27.126 --> 10:30.046
THEN SOMEBODY COMES AND SHIPS
THOSE BANANAS OFF TO MOZAMBIQUE,

10:30.129 --> 10:34.008
AND YOU STILL HAVE TO BE STRONG
FOR THOSE BANANAS' FATHER!

10:34.091 --> 10:34.967
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:35.051 --> 10:37.887
I CAN LIVE
WITHOUT THE BANANAS.

10:37.970 --> 10:38.262
- WELL, I CAN'T!

10:38.346 --> 10:40.056
GET OUT!

10:40.139 --> 10:41.849
YOU AND YOUR DUCK.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.895
HEY, WHERE ARE ALL
OF YOU GOING?

10:45.978 --> 10:47.813
- HE'S OUR RIDE.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.070
- I WAS PACKING.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.821
WHAT'S THE BIG EMERGENCY?

10:55.905 --> 10:56.697
- WE'RE PULLING A FAST ONE.

11:00.659 --> 11:03.037
- PLEASE HOLD
FOR MS. KIMBERLY PHILLIPS.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.873
THIS IS THE U.S. EMBASSY
IN MOZAMBIQUE.

11:05.956 --> 11:06.999
IT TURNS OUT, MOM--
THAT'S YOU--

11:07.083 --> 11:09.752
HAS DECIDED TO TAKE
A DIFFERENT JOB INSTEAD,

11:09.835 --> 11:12.171
AND SHE'S GIVING THEM
THE NEWS RIGHT NOW.

11:12.254 --> 11:12.922
- WHAT?

11:13.005 --> 11:14.632
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

11:14.715 --> 11:15.841
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MOM'S--

11:15.925 --> 11:19.678
YES, THIS
IS KIMBERLY PHILLIPS.

11:19.762 --> 11:24.642
YOU JUST HIRED ME TO DO LAWYERLY
THINGS FOR YOUR EMBASSY.

11:24.725 --> 11:25.476
I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

11:25.559 --> 11:28.104
THAT I AM NO LONGER AVAILABLE.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.565
I THANK YOU,
GOD BLESS AMERICA, AND--

11:31.649 --> 11:33.567
I'M SORRY,
WHAT?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.277
WHY AM I DECLINING?

11:35.361 --> 11:38.823
UM, WELL,
BECAUSE...

11:38.906 --> 11:40.950
I'VE JUST BOUGHT A HOUSE
IN PHILADELPHIA,

11:41.033 --> 11:45.663
AND AFRICA IS TOO LONG
OF A COMMUTE.

11:45.746 --> 11:49.625
SO I WILL BE JOINING
A FIRM HERE.

11:49.708 --> 11:53.045
UH, WHAT FIRM?

11:53.129 --> 11:54.964
KRAKOV AND ASSOCIATES.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.091
"WE GET CASH FOR YOUR CRASH."

11:59.844 --> 12:00.761
- WHAT?

12:00.845 --> 12:03.472
I SAW IT ON THE SIDE
OF A BUS.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.099
- UH, WHAT?

12:05.182 --> 12:07.893
OF COURSE THIS
IS KIMBERLY PHILLIPS.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.312
WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS,
HER DAUGHTER?

12:10.396 --> 12:13.357
PLEASE DON'T TELL MY MOM.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.985
- WELL, THAT WAS SMOOTH.

12:16.068 --> 12:21.157
- MY SUBMARINE IDEA ISN'T
LOOKING SO STUPID NOW, IS IT?

12:24.034 --> 12:25.244
- HEY, STEPH.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.079
I HAVE WAY TOO MUCH STUFF
TO PACK FOR AFRICA.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.164
CAN I BORROW ONE
OF YOUR BAGS?

12:28.247 --> 12:29.331
- SURE.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.332
ANYTHING
BUT MY RED PRADA PURSE.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.502
- THEN NEVER MIND.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.921
- YES, CLOWN WORLD?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.798
I NEED A CLOWN
FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.341
YEAH, I'LL HOLD.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.676
- OH, GABBY,
CAN YOU SAY--

12:40.759 --> 12:41.677
- NO.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.595
- OKAY.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.473
I THINK THAT'LL CUT TOGETHER.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.807
UH, STEPH,
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT--

12:46.891 --> 12:48.309
- NOT NOW, CHARLIE!

12:48.392 --> 12:50.019
THE WHOLE CLOWN COMMUNITY'S
TURNED ON ME,

12:50.102 --> 12:51.353
AND I'M DESPERATE!

12:51.437 --> 12:53.481
I EVEN TRIED THIS PLACE
CALLED "CLOWN AND DIRTY."

12:53.564 --> 12:56.233
TURNS OUT
THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER THING.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.444
- REAL QUICK:

12:58.527 --> 13:00.070
THE KIDS' FLIGHT LEAVES
AT 5:00.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.198
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE
HOME IN TIME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.449
- NO PROBLEM.
I'LL BE HERE AT 3:00.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.658
[cell phone chimes]

13:04.742 --> 13:06.035
OH, YES!

13:06.118 --> 13:07.536
I'M SAVED.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.122
TRISH SAYS IF I CAN'T FIND
A CLOWN, SHE HAS A SOLUTION.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.667
- STEPH, CAN I TAKE A PAIR OF
YOUR BOOTS FOR THE RAINY SEASON?

13:13.751 --> 13:15.419
- ANYTHING BUT MY
BLACK-STUDDED LOUBOUTINS.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.504
- THAT'S COOL.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.963
- OR MY SUEDE JIMMY CHOOS.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.008
- UGH! SO CLOSE.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.385
GIMME THAT!

13:31.644 --> 13:33.020
- OKAY, TRISH,
SO WHERE'S THE CLOWN?

13:36.482 --> 13:38.108
I DON'T GET IT.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.736
- HONK, HONK.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.406
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.407
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

13:45.491 --> 13:46.951
- OH, YOU BET I AM.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.452
WE CANNOT MESS THIS UP.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.205
THERE IS A BUTTLOAD OF POTENTIAL
BUSINESS OUT THERE

13:51.288 --> 13:53.415
PLAYING IN THAT BALL PIT.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.417
- OKAY, BUT WHY DO
I HAVE TO DO IT?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.795
- BECAUSE I'M NOT THE ONE
THAT ALIENATED EVERY CLOWN,

13:57.878 --> 14:01.549
JUGGLER, AND MIME
IN PHILADELPHIA.

14:01.632 --> 14:05.469
- TRISH, I HAVE TO GET HOME
AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO MY KIDS.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.804
- YOU'LL BE DONE
IN PLENTY OF TIME.

14:06.887 --> 14:07.805
I PROMISE.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.265
WE NEED THIS.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.434
WELCOME
TO MIDDLE MANAGEMENT.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.772
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
GATHER AROUND.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.233
I'M NOT GOING TO SEE YOU
FOR A WHILE,

14:19.316 --> 14:21.610
SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME
THINGS TO TAKE WITH YOU.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.695
- PRESENTS?

14:22.778 --> 14:23.821
- BETTER:

14:23.904 --> 14:26.532
WORDS OF WISDOM.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.741
- HOW ARE THOSE BETTER?

14:27.825 --> 14:28.576
- BOY, I'M TRYING
TO HAVE A MOMENT HERE.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.036
DON'T MAKE ME POP YOU.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.707
- JAMES,

14:34.790 --> 14:36.917
YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE VOICE
YOU HEAR IN YOUR HEAD,

14:37.001 --> 14:39.461
THE ONE THAT TELLS
YOU WHAT TO DO?

14:39.545 --> 14:40.546
- YEAH.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.132
- HE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.300
TUNE HIM OUT,

14:44.383 --> 14:50.097
OR ONE DAY HE'S GONNA
BE YOUR CELL MATE.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.765
AARON.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.728
OH, YOU ARE SUCH
A SWEET BABY.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.814
NEVER TAKE ADVICE FROM JAMES

14:58.897 --> 15:02.610
BECAUSE HE IS GOING TO LISTEN
TO THAT LITTLE VOICE.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.694
- IT'S TRUE.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.821
- MM-HMM.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.323
AND GABBY,

15:07.406 --> 15:11.619
YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL,

15:11.702 --> 15:15.664
AND BOYS ARE GOING
TO COME OUT OF THE WOODWORK

15:15.748 --> 15:17.583
WANTING TO DATE YOU,

15:17.666 --> 15:19.251
BUY YOU THINGS,

15:19.335 --> 15:21.337
PROMISE YOU THE WORLD.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.006
LET THEM.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.008
- [laughs]

15:26.091 --> 15:27.217
- OOH.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.261
- GRANDMA MAGGIE,
ARE YOU CRYING?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.679
- NO.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.805
I LOVE YOU,
BUT I CAN'T, BABY.

15:31.889 --> 15:35.059
I JUST PAID $300
FOR THESE LASHES.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.727
- IT'S TIME TO GO.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.187
YOU GUYS HAVE GOT YOUR THINGS.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.688
I'VE GOT MY MEMORIES.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.898
LET'S GET YOU IN THE CAR.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.024
- BUT WHAT ABOUT STEPHANIE?

15:42.107 --> 15:43.525
SHE'S NOT BACK
FROM WORK YET.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.653
- IF WE WAIT ANY LONGER,
WE'RE GOING TO MISS OUR FLIGHT.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.154
- OH...

15:47.237 --> 15:50.282
- GRANDMA MAGGIE,
YOUR EYELASHES!

15:50.366 --> 15:51.575
- I KNOW, BABY.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.244
I GOT GLUE IN MY EYES.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.373
- KIDS, I'M HERE!

15:57.456 --> 16:01.543
I MADE IT!

16:01.627 --> 16:02.878
- THE KIDS ARE ALREADY GONE.

16:02.961 --> 16:04.254
YOU JUST MISSED THEM.

16:04.338 --> 16:04.922
- WHAT?

16:05.005 --> 16:07.299
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

16:07.383 --> 16:10.803
- I COULDN'T FIND MY CAR KEYS
IN THESE FRICKIN' CLOWN POCKETS.

16:10.886 --> 16:14.181
- AARON DREW YOU
A GOOD-BYE CARD.

16:14.264 --> 16:17.059
- HONEY, I DON'T WANT
AN AARON CARD!

16:17.142 --> 16:19.603
I WANT AN AARON HUG.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.480
I'VE GOT TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

16:22.898 --> 16:25.442
CHARLIE, TAKE ME
TO THE AIRPORT.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.821
I ALMOST TOOK OUT A JOGGER
DRIVING IN THESE SHOES!

16:30.155 --> 16:31.573
- WHAT'S THE ISSUE HERE?

16:31.657 --> 16:34.743
- HAS THIS BAG LEFT YOUR PERSON
AT ANY TIME?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.162
- IT MOST DEFINITELY HAS NOT.

16:39.248 --> 16:44.420
AT ONE POINT, I DID GO GET
A CINNAMON BUN.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.756
- CARE TO EXPLAIN THESE?

16:47.840 --> 16:48.966
- CARE TO EXPLAIN THESE?

16:49.049 --> 16:53.595
- I BELIEVE THAT ONE'S
A BONING KNIFE.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.847
- AND THOSE SHAMPOO BOTTLES?

16:54.930 --> 16:55.764
WAY OVER THREE OUNCES.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.808
- AND THE MOUTHWASH?

16:57.891 --> 17:00.352
LIGHTER FLUID.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.770
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD CANCEL
OUR TICKETS

17:01.854 --> 17:04.982
WHILE YOU FIGURE THIS OUT.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.942
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.028
YOU KIDS ARE SO...

17:09.111 --> 17:10.194
GROUNDED!

17:10.279 --> 17:13.615
- AND THANKS TO YOU,
SO IS FLIGHT 435.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.992
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

17:16.076 --> 17:17.661
- WE THOUGHT IT WOULD GET YOU
ON THE NO-FLY LIST.

17:17.744 --> 17:20.247
- YEAH, I GOT THAT PART!

17:20.329 --> 17:23.959
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU WANTED ME THERE!

17:24.041 --> 17:26.627
- MOM, WE LOVE YOU,

17:26.712 --> 17:29.590
BUT WE DON'T WANT
TO MOVE TO MOZAMBIQUE.

17:30.883 --> 17:31.842
- OH, MAN.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.386
THIS IS LIKE
CHRISTMAS MORNING.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.764
- CAUGHT CHUCKLES TRYING
TO RUN THROUGH A CHECKPOINT.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.974
- PLEASE, I'M JUST TRYING
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO MY KIDS.

17:39.057 --> 17:42.728
[gasps] OH, LOOK,
YOU'RE ALL HERE!

17:42.811 --> 17:45.606
WELL, THIS WORKED OUT.

17:45.689 --> 17:46.607
JAMES, IT'S ME.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.818
- IT KNOWS MY NAME!

17:49.902 --> 17:52.780
- IDIOT, IT'S STEPHANIE.

17:52.863 --> 17:53.822
- STEPHANIE?

17:53.906 --> 17:54.782
- STEPHANIE?

17:54.865 --> 17:56.492
- STEPHANIE!

17:56.575 --> 17:57.826
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:57.910 --> 18:00.954
- I COULDN'T LET YOU GUYS LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

18:01.038 --> 18:06.001
- SO YOU RAN THROUGH AIRPORT
SECURITY IN A CLOWN SUIT?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.796
- I AM GOING
TO MISS YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.302
JAMES?

18:18.680 --> 18:20.390
IT'S OKAY.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.434
I UNDERSTAND.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.315
- I MISS YOU ALREADY.

18:32.110 --> 18:34.404
- I COULD USE ONE
OF THOSE TOO.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.948
- ME TOO.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.660
- I DON'T NEED IT,
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

18:39.743 --> 18:42.955
[all blow noses]

18:43.038 --> 18:45.749
- IT'S KIND OF TOUCHING,
ACTUALLY.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.753
- I'M GOING
TO GO CALL MY KIDS.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.547
- STEPHANIE?

18:51.630 --> 18:53.674
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

18:55.259 --> 18:57.219
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.389
A YEAR OVERSEAS WITH THEM
SOUNDED LIKE A DREAM...

19:00.472 --> 19:04.393
BUT OBVIOUSLY
THEY DON'T WANT TO GO.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.270
AND YOU'RE SO GREAT WITH THEM.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.564
THEY LOVE YOU.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.357
I DON'T KNOW.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.985
THEIR LIVES ARE HERE, BUT...

19:13.068 --> 19:15.737
YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH ALREADY.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.615
I COULDN'T ASK YOU TO TAKE THEM
FOR ANOTHER YEAR.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.993
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

19:21.076 --> 19:22.578
ASK ME.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.247
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO ASK ME NICELY.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.165
- REALLY?

19:27.249 --> 19:28.750
ARE YOU SURE?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.211
- LOOK AT ME.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.173
- MOM, WE KNOW YOU LOVE US.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.552
THIS JUST
ISN'T THE RIGHT TIME.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.470
GO.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.514
IT'S OKAY.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.516
- COME HERE.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.519
- IT WASN'T EASY TALKING MY WAY
IN HERE,

19:47.603 --> 19:49.104
BUT I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY.

19:49.187 --> 19:52.733
THESE VIDEOS WERE
A TERRIBLE IDEA.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.401
I WATCHED THEM,

19:54.484 --> 19:57.654
AND THEY MADE ME HORRIBLY SAD.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.659
KIM, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE NOT
TAKING THE KIDS TO MOZAMBIQUE.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.244
- CHARLIE,
SHE'S NOT TAKING THE KIDS.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.663
- DARN RIGHT,
SHE'S NOT.

20:06.747 --> 20:07.956
- IS HE STILL LIKE THIS?

20:08.040 --> 20:08.332
- GIRL...
