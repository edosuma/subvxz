WEBVTT

00:05.487 --> 00:07.526
(Car accelerating)

00:21.438 --> 00:23.437
(Groaning)

00:25.076 --> 00:27.875
(Jano) Is she definitely alive?
She's stopped shouting.

00:29.394 --> 00:31.393
(Tamaz)
She's alive.

00:32.752 --> 00:34.831
(Jano)
We should check, no?

00:37.070 --> 00:40.348
(Tamaz) I'm sitting on
the fucking thing. She's moving, okay?

00:41.428 --> 00:42.727
(Groans)

00:42.827 --> 00:44.826
(Knocking)

00:47.625 --> 00:49.624
(Car doors shutting)

00:50.703 --> 00:52.822
(Jano)
Man, this is fucked up.

00:53.382 --> 00:56.540
(Tamaz)
Shut up. Let's just do this.

00:57.899 --> 01:01.397
(Jano)
Tamaz! We need help. It's heavy.

01:01.497 --> 01:06.195
(Tamaz) Poor baby. Hey!
What the fuck is this? You're not ready.

01:06.295 --> 01:07.874
(Jano)
We're ready.

01:07.974 --> 01:11.452
(Tamaz) You're telling me
that's deep enough? Bullshit!

01:12.691 --> 01:15.810
(Tamaz)
You dig then.

01:16.849 --> 01:20.108
(Jano)
Just get her in. Boss is here.

01:20.208 --> 01:22.526
(Thud)

01:23.686 --> 01:25.465
(Clattering)

01:25.565 --> 01:27.344
(Dramatic music)

01:27.444 --> 01:29.723
(Panicked gasps)

01:31.961 --> 01:34.820
(Thud)

01:34.920 --> 01:36.899
(Electrical hum)

01:36.999 --> 01:39.977
(Tamaz)
You're a lazy bastard, Jano.

01:40.077 --> 01:44.235
I ask you for one simple job
and you fuck it up!

01:52.670 --> 01:59.067
(Crying softly) Please let me out!
Please let me out!

02:00.186 --> 02:02.185
(Shovelling)

02:03.385 --> 02:05.744
(Mirlinda's panicked breaths)

02:07.982 --> 02:11.281
- (Quiet voices)
- (Shovelling continues)

02:11.381 --> 02:13.460
(Mirlinda gasping and sobbing)

02:17.457 --> 02:19.456
(Koba)
Luan did this to her.

02:20.576 --> 02:22.954
- Don't forget.
- (Mirlinda) Let me out!

02:23.054 --> 02:24.913
Somebody!

02:25.013 --> 02:27.572
Somebody help me!

02:29.131 --> 02:30.790
Help me!

02:30.890 --> 02:33.229
(Cries fade)

02:33.329 --> 02:35.688
(Dramatic music grows louder)

02:40.965 --> 02:43.324
Let me out!

02:44.363 --> 02:46.362
(Banging)

02:47.242 --> 02:49.541
(Screams) Luan!

02:49.641 --> 02:51.639
Get me out!

02:52.079 --> 02:54.078
Luan!

02:54.438 --> 02:56.437
Luan!

02:58.676 --> 03:00.675
Luan!

03:06.552 --> 03:08.171
Babi!

03:08.271 --> 03:10.550
Babi! Babi!

03:11.989 --> 03:13.988
Look.

03:16.426 --> 03:18.505
Is Mummy really
coming home today?

03:19.425 --> 03:23.823
Of course, Bukoreshe.
She cannot wait to see you.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.659
(Indistinct speech in Albanian)

03:39.055 --> 03:41.053
She's coming, trust me.

04:38.383 --> 04:39.563
(Luan)
Where is she?

04:39.663 --> 04:42.501
Not here. Obviously.

04:48.978 --> 04:51.476
You broke our agreement.

04:51.576 --> 04:54.555
- Marian got away.
- Nothing to do with me.

04:54.655 --> 04:57.173
Someone must have
helped her.

04:58.093 --> 05:00.092
Not my men.

05:00.931 --> 05:05.169
Koba, please,
I knew nothing about it.

05:09.047 --> 05:11.126
It's a shame, man.

05:12.086 --> 05:15.284
I gave you a chance,
you messed it up.

05:17.123 --> 05:19.122
Now look.

05:31.116 --> 05:33.874
(Koba)
She has enough air for now.

05:35.074 --> 05:38.392
(Voice trembling)
I'll give you everything I have, please.

05:39.511 --> 05:41.770
Please give me my wife.

05:41.870 --> 05:44.309
Please, Koba.

05:46.108 --> 05:48.107
(Sobbing)

05:54.064 --> 05:57.202
Gather your guys.
Everyone loyal to you.

05:57.302 --> 06:01.400
Tell them, "Fuck Marian Wallace,
you work for Koba now."

06:01.500 --> 06:04.198
- I'll do that.
- You buy from me, give a cut to me,

06:04.298 --> 06:08.256
and anywhere in this city you find
disloyalty, you bring them to me.

06:08.976 --> 06:12.354
Call a meeting. Tonight.
I want everyone there.

06:12.454 --> 06:13.833
Come with your men.

06:13.933 --> 06:17.471
State all this publicly
and I will give you her location.

06:17.571 --> 06:19.870
(Luan) Oh, please, that's going
to be hours away, Eddie!

06:19.970 --> 06:22.149
Luan.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.248
Have faith in her, Luan.

06:26.527 --> 06:28.525
Do we have a deal?

06:29.205 --> 06:31.684
- Do we have a deal?
- Yeah.

06:34.722 --> 06:36.541
Good.

06:36.641 --> 06:38.640
See you then.

06:40.919 --> 06:42.918
Let's go.

06:44.797 --> 06:46.796
(Luan sobbing)

06:53.073 --> 06:55.071
(Crying)

07:05.066 --> 07:08.205
(Singer) You are the only one
who has a foot in both camps.

07:08.305 --> 07:11.163
I don't care what your plan is.

07:11.263 --> 07:15.841
Sean Wallace will set this city on fire.
I'm not waiting around to get burned.

07:15.941 --> 07:19.998
You've had two days,
so get me out.

07:20.098 --> 07:25.136
Sean is volatile. For now,
that's what makes him useful.

07:25.975 --> 07:28.554
Sends a message
that this city is no longer viable.

07:28.654 --> 07:33.751
I mean, London,
with Sean Wallace at the helm.

07:33.851 --> 07:36.070
Would you invest?

07:36.170 --> 07:38.928
(Tube train rumbling)

07:39.608 --> 07:46.025
And what happens when
he gets cocky, stops taking orders?

07:46.125 --> 07:49.863
Then I'll need someone in play
to keep him in line.

07:49.963 --> 07:55.200
Someone with experience
who understands how he thinks.

07:58.678 --> 08:02.296
No. No fucking way.
Fuck that, fuck you.

08:02.396 --> 08:04.495
- I'm not interested.
- Think... about it, Carter.

08:04.595 --> 08:09.233
Koba's asking questions,
and it's my neck on the line.

08:11.791 --> 08:15.809
Maybe I'm tired
of protecting Sean Wallace.

08:15.909 --> 08:17.968
Maybe next time Koba asks,

08:18.068 --> 08:20.207
I'll tell him exactly
who's been targeting his men.

08:20.307 --> 08:23.445
We both know you wouldn't.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.304
In exchange for
my father's safety, I would.

08:27.463 --> 08:30.042
I'd tell Koba and the Investors

08:30.142 --> 08:33.580
exactly what you're planning
and with who.

08:34.499 --> 08:39.097
So... Get. Me. Out.

08:43.255 --> 08:46.653
Okay. I'll make arrangements.

08:47.532 --> 08:50.011
I'll need that data chip, please.

08:51.690 --> 08:53.669
(Phone vibrates)

08:53.769 --> 08:55.768
(Elliot)
I'll bring it.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.207
You're making a mistake,
you know.

08:59.846 --> 09:03.224
This is a chance
to change this city.

09:03.324 --> 09:05.323
No.

09:06.203 --> 09:08.321
There's nothing here for me.

09:10.081 --> 09:12.159
Go on, Danny!

09:14.278 --> 09:16.537
(Ed)
Oh, yes. Go on, son!

09:16.637 --> 09:18.636
(Man)
Go on, get him!

09:20.715 --> 09:22.714
- (Cheering)
- Come on!

09:23.114 --> 09:25.113
(Ed laughing)

09:25.752 --> 09:27.751
Oh, good.

09:33.028 --> 09:36.806
- Thanks for coming.
- I'm glad you called.

09:36.906 --> 09:39.905
(Shannon) Well, I'm just doing
what's best for Danny.

09:45.262 --> 09:47.261
- Shannon...
- Don't, Dad.

09:49.940 --> 09:53.518
(Man)
Get your head up! Shoot...

09:53.618 --> 09:55.317
That's a bit modern for you.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.416
The tie.

10:01.733 --> 10:03.732
It's Alex's.

10:14.687 --> 10:17.165
I failed you both
and I'm sorry.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.675
(Gun cocking)

10:41.273 --> 10:43.272
Take me to Mirlinda.

10:44.071 --> 10:46.310
(Shallow breaths)

10:48.829 --> 10:52.067
Luan, believe me. I didn't know
what Koba was planning.

10:56.665 --> 10:58.663
Really?

10:59.703 --> 11:06.159
Then what have you done
when Koba put my wife in the ground?

11:06.259 --> 11:09.118
If you do this, he will not stop.
He'll come for your whole family.

11:09.218 --> 11:11.217
That's my wife!

11:12.216 --> 11:14.215
My wife!

11:23.211 --> 11:25.449
(Luan)
They took everything from you.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.287
Your power.

11:31.366 --> 11:33.365
Your principles.

11:34.525 --> 11:36.524
And then your son.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.678
When will you fight back?

12:19.941 --> 12:22.140
(Raining)

12:42.249 --> 12:44.248
Where is she?

13:03.078 --> 13:05.077
Mirlinda!

13:06.716 --> 13:08.715
Mirlinda!

13:09.675 --> 13:11.294
(Mirlinda)
Luan!

13:11.394 --> 13:13.053
(Sobbing)

13:13.153 --> 13:14.612
(Banging)

13:14.712 --> 13:16.711
(Sobbing, panicked breaths)

13:28.065 --> 13:30.064
(Cries out)

13:39.459 --> 13:41.458
Luan.

13:41.898 --> 13:43.897
Luan!

13:46.415 --> 13:47.954
Luan!

13:48.054 --> 13:49.793
(Luan)
Mirlinda!

13:49.893 --> 13:52.172
(Gasping and sobbing)

13:59.688 --> 14:01.687
No!

14:15.840 --> 14:18.199
(Tamaz)
What? He didn't tell you?

14:23.556 --> 14:26.234
We were tracking
the phone all along.

14:30.832 --> 14:32.831
(Cries out)

14:40.427 --> 14:43.425
(Luan gasping)

15:10.851 --> 15:12.850
(Roars)

15:15.089 --> 15:17.088
Aargh!

15:19.286 --> 15:21.285
(Luan gasping)

16:20.015 --> 16:22.493
(Thud as soil clatters)

17:16.265 --> 17:18.664
(Gasping)

17:25.380 --> 17:28.019
(Water rushing)

17:37.614 --> 17:39.613
Luan!

17:49.008 --> 17:51.007
(Water dripping)

18:01.321 --> 18:03.320
(Moaning)

18:32.945 --> 18:36.223
(Baby crying)

18:37.822 --> 18:39.821
(Sighs)

18:52.414 --> 18:54.413
(Crying stops)

18:56.652 --> 18:58.691
(Shushing)

19:58.420 --> 20:01.458
Someone's got to the money.
Half the accounts have been emptied.

20:04.057 --> 20:07.435
- What are you talking about?
- There's only 500 million left.

20:07.535 --> 20:10.373
- That's a third of what we had.
- No, no, no.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.852
It's our money.
We're fucked without it.

20:15.811 --> 20:17.810
Um...

20:18.529 --> 20:22.567
There just might be a way
that I can save the rest of the funds.

20:26.605 --> 20:29.263
(Marian) Thanks for handling
those payments for me,

20:29.363 --> 20:31.362
but the situation has changed.

20:32.522 --> 20:35.380
- Sean's alive and he's in London.
- What?

20:35.480 --> 20:37.219
(Marian) He's planning
on taking the city back.

20:37.319 --> 20:40.478
- I'm going to need your help.
- What?

20:41.437 --> 20:43.616
- Anything to drink?
- Er, water, please.

20:43.716 --> 20:45.775
But does he know about us,
that you got me out?

20:45.875 --> 20:49.893
No. And I think
we should keep it that way.

20:49.993 --> 20:51.572
Yeah.

20:51.672 --> 20:54.770
I need you to go to this lawyer,
Rutherford,

20:54.870 --> 20:56.809
and secure the last of our money.

20:56.909 --> 20:59.748
He's on a flight at 4pm
so you need to hurry.

21:03.705 --> 21:07.344
- Why me?
- Because he won't see you coming.

21:08.743 --> 21:11.841
When I visited you inside,
you told me you were ready

21:11.941 --> 21:16.039
to build something of your own
for you, for Danny.

21:16.139 --> 21:18.078
You've proved yourself tenfold.

21:18.178 --> 21:21.036
What they did to Alex is
the very reason you keep fighting.

21:21.136 --> 21:23.455
Till you're the one
calling the shots.

21:25.054 --> 21:27.053
Marian...
(Clears throat)

21:28.173 --> 21:30.751
If I decide to do this,

21:30.851 --> 21:33.490
I need to know that Danny
and my dad will be safe.

21:34.049 --> 21:38.207
- Of course. Our deal still stands.
- No matter what Sean decides.

21:39.567 --> 21:41.566
You have my word.

21:42.085 --> 21:44.084
Okay.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.958
(Muffled chatter)

21:56.837 --> 21:58.836
(Door closes)

22:07.112 --> 22:09.371
(Man)
How can I help, Ms Dumani?

22:09.471 --> 22:11.950
(Shannon)
I need you to look at an account.

22:17.227 --> 22:19.226
(She clears throat)

22:19.785 --> 22:22.744
It's one of four
Bradbury Holdings accounts.

22:25.742 --> 22:28.461
I'm sorry, but I know nothing
about that account.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.499
Really?

22:34.578 --> 22:36.816
Then why are you doing a runner?

22:40.055 --> 22:42.234
Please,
I told Asif Afridi all I know...

22:42.334 --> 22:44.333
I'm not here
on Mr Afridi's behalf.

22:45.972 --> 22:48.850
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

22:58.605 --> 23:00.984
I think you'll find a way.

23:01.084 --> 23:05.461
(Asif) I think the lawyer
is holding out on us.

23:05.561 --> 23:08.680
But don't worry,
we have retrieved the majority.

23:09.399 --> 23:11.478
Just 500 million remaining.

23:13.637 --> 23:15.956
I have someone on the case.

23:27.070 --> 23:29.069
(Creaking)

23:35.346 --> 23:37.345
(Clatter)

23:51.017 --> 23:53.016
(Creaking)

24:12.846 --> 24:14.845
(Phone ringing)

24:30.597 --> 24:32.596
(Phone ringing)

24:41.031 --> 24:43.030
(Whispers)
Fuck!

24:48.827 --> 24:51.626
- Shannon!
- Mr Rutherford, I've got the Bermuda...

24:53.705 --> 24:56.223
- No. No.
- The fuck are you doing? Get off me!

25:04.939 --> 25:07.757
- We need to get out of here.
- Like I'm going anywhere with you.

25:07.857 --> 25:11.695
- Do you have a better option?
- (Shannon breathless)

25:12.814 --> 25:14.813
(Elliot)
Come on.

25:15.413 --> 25:17.412
Go.

25:20.011 --> 25:22.729
(Tyres screeching)

25:36.122 --> 25:38.101
(Elliot)
Rutherford was my mark.

25:38.201 --> 25:39.700
(Shannon)
He's dead so you should be happy.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.220
Not when you left
a witness out there.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.298
But if you hadn't 'helped'
there wouldn't be a problem.

25:43.398 --> 25:46.337
Why are you doing this?
Danny needs you.

25:46.437 --> 25:48.816
- What you risking this for?
- Everything I do is for Danny.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.214
- Doesn't look like it from here.
- You don't get the moral high ground.

25:51.314 --> 25:54.493
I don't want it. But I don't want
to see you and Danny hurt either.

25:54.593 --> 25:58.930
You walked into our life, convinced
my son you were sticking around.

25:59.030 --> 26:01.149
So your kid not having a dad
is my fault now?

26:02.348 --> 26:04.347
Wow!

26:06.506 --> 26:10.004
(Sighs) Let me out the car, Elliot.

26:10.104 --> 26:11.763
- Shannon, I'm sorry...
- You failed your own family.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.363
Don't tell me how to protect mine.

26:13.463 --> 26:15.761
You don't know anything
about my family!

26:15.861 --> 26:17.960
You're right, I don't.
You're a fucking stranger. So let me out.

26:18.060 --> 26:20.439
- No.
- Let me out now!

26:20.539 --> 26:22.778
Not until you tell me
why you killed him!

26:24.097 --> 26:25.956
- What are you doing?
- Ow!

26:26.056 --> 26:28.055
Sorry. Just... Stop it!

26:48.804 --> 26:50.803
(Lock releases)

26:51.283 --> 26:53.681
(Elliot)
It was never a lie.

26:54.401 --> 26:56.400
With you and Danny.

26:58.079 --> 27:00.858
- I wanted to come with you.
- Yeah, but you didn't.

27:00.958 --> 27:02.957
Why didn't you?

27:06.435 --> 27:09.073
(Miss Kane)
You have a chance to save their lives.

27:23.546 --> 27:27.624
(Man reciting prayer in Arabic)

27:44.575 --> 27:47.473
Allahu akbar!
Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar!

27:47.573 --> 27:50.292
(Prayer continues)

28:15.918 --> 28:17.737
(Crying)

28:17.837 --> 28:19.836
Saba.

28:20.316 --> 28:22.215
What do you want?

28:22.315 --> 28:24.694
Cuz, you know
you can't be in there.

28:24.794 --> 28:27.732
I know. I just didn't want
my last memory to...

28:27.832 --> 28:30.471
(Faz shushing)

28:31.670 --> 28:34.129
Not a single man in there
loves him as much as I do.

28:34.229 --> 28:36.727
- I know.
- And I can't be in there?

28:36.827 --> 28:38.166
Trust me, I know this.

28:38.266 --> 28:40.265
He's gone now.

28:43.424 --> 28:45.463
Yeah, well,
what am I gonna do?

28:46.262 --> 28:48.381
Now that he's gone.

28:53.698 --> 28:55.517
(Talking indistinctly)

28:55.617 --> 28:57.616
(Quiet suspenseful music)

29:07.091 --> 29:10.989
- What do you want, Saba?
- I want to stay here.

29:11.089 --> 29:16.007
I need to finish my studies, Hakim.
I can be useful to you. I promise.

29:18.245 --> 29:20.244
I don't need a waitress.

29:21.124 --> 29:23.922
I can do deliveries.
Faz will show me.

29:25.642 --> 29:27.541
Come on, I'm a fast learner

29:27.641 --> 29:30.279
and I won't get stopped and searched
as much as the boys.

29:35.037 --> 29:37.036
Okay.

29:37.515 --> 29:40.674
- We'll see how it goes.
- Thank you.

29:42.233 --> 29:44.352
I loved Basem too as well,
you know.

29:48.590 --> 29:52.428
That man practically raised me,
and you know that.

29:54.347 --> 29:58.045
We're gonna find out who shot Basem,
and they're gonna pay.

29:58.145 --> 30:00.423
I promise you.
Allah.

30:06.980 --> 30:08.979
(Echoing thud)

30:13.456 --> 30:15.455
(Buzzing)

30:27.809 --> 30:30.488
(Lale) Koba's called Merwan
to a meeting tonight.

30:31.607 --> 30:34.086
We're tired of that lunatic
running things.

30:36.364 --> 30:39.143
My comrades want to know
when we're receiving the money.

30:39.243 --> 30:41.242
- Merwan has...
- Soon.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.440
'Soon' is not a time.

30:45.799 --> 30:47.978
My mother's contacting her sources.

30:48.078 --> 30:50.197
Tell your comrades to wait.

30:52.916 --> 30:55.314
I won't let you down,
I promise.

31:03.910 --> 31:06.928
- I'm sorry, Billy.
- I know.

31:07.028 --> 31:09.127
You had to.

31:09.227 --> 31:11.086
(Baby crying)

31:11.186 --> 31:13.725
If there was another way...

31:13.825 --> 31:15.824
I'd have taken it.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.102
It's all their fault,
Mum and Dad's.

31:20.621 --> 31:22.980
Can't escape, being a Wallace.

31:25.179 --> 31:26.838
What if I'm not good enough?

31:26.938 --> 31:31.096
You are good enough.
Look, what would Dad do?

31:32.175 --> 31:34.614
Cut a deal
with the most powerful man in the room.

31:36.933 --> 31:41.370
- And slowly bleed him dry.
- This is gonna take time.

31:42.530 --> 31:45.828
But I haven't got time.
And I'm not Dad.

31:45.928 --> 31:49.626
- Stop trying to be.
- (Baby crying)

31:49.726 --> 31:52.165
You've been preparing for this
your whole life.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.483
You can do it, your way.

31:58.002 --> 32:00.000
Thank you.

32:22.389 --> 32:24.388
(Keys jangling)

33:03.527 --> 33:05.266
(Elliot)
What are you doing here?

33:05.366 --> 33:07.665
.You weren't answering
your phone.

33:07.765 --> 33:10.443
- What happened with the lawyer?
- I sorted it.

33:11.243 --> 33:15.681
We had to deal with a witness.
She filed a police report.

33:17.520 --> 33:20.558
The report mentioned
two assailants.

33:23.117 --> 33:27.674
Don't push us, Elliot.
You are not indispensable.

33:35.190 --> 33:37.189
(Phone vibrating)

33:42.387 --> 33:45.305
(Singer) Arrangements have
been made. You leave tomorrow.

33:47.584 --> 33:49.683
Unless something's changed
since this morning?

33:49.783 --> 33:53.821
- No. No, nothing's changed.
- Good, bring my chip with you.

34:01.776 --> 34:03.775
(Heavy door opens)

34:04.655 --> 34:06.654
(Door closes)

34:08.253 --> 34:10.572
(Approaching footsteps)

34:22.765 --> 34:24.804
(Door opens then closes)

34:32.440 --> 34:34.479
Be better than us.

35:10.101 --> 35:12.419
(Baby begins to cry)

35:16.817 --> 35:20.075
(Door opening)

35:20.175 --> 35:21.914
- (Crying continues)
- (Echo of door closing)

35:22.014 --> 35:24.013
(Door opens)

35:26.612 --> 35:28.611
- (Door closes)
- Where's Roze?

35:31.569 --> 35:33.848
I took her away.

35:35.247 --> 35:37.246
Somewhere safe.

35:40.525 --> 35:45.062
You had no right to do that.
She was my responsibility.

35:45.162 --> 35:49.440
Exactly. I had to keep her safe
from you, Mum.

35:55.237 --> 35:57.236
I see.

36:13.267 --> 36:14.766
(Singer)
You were right.

36:14.866 --> 36:18.924
Elliot's confirmed that Koba is
meeting with the gangs tonight.

36:19.024 --> 36:21.863
All of the bosses will be there.

36:22.542 --> 36:24.741
What are you thinking, Sean?

36:33.097 --> 36:34.756
(Voices murmuring)

36:34.856 --> 36:38.554
Gather everyone.
We hit Koba tonight.

36:38.654 --> 36:42.192
We strike all his strongholds
simultaneously.

36:42.292 --> 36:45.091
Eight teams take down
his entire network.

36:49.248 --> 36:51.327
(Lale)
You heard him.

36:57.004 --> 36:59.623
(Sean) I want you
to coordinate the attack.

36:59.723 --> 37:01.722
Okay?

37:12.116 --> 37:14.355
(Agitated conversations)

37:22.431 --> 37:25.309
(Lale) At least Marian Wallace
delivered on her guns.

37:27.868 --> 37:29.867
I told you he would come through.

37:31.426 --> 37:34.385
Don't speak too soon.

37:39.342 --> 37:42.320
You were right.
I need to do things my way.

37:42.420 --> 37:44.419
What can I do?

37:47.618 --> 37:49.617
(Cocks gun)

37:52.535 --> 37:54.534
All right. Go.

37:55.334 --> 37:57.333
Let's move out!

38:18.761 --> 38:20.760
(Engine starts)

38:21.920 --> 38:23.919
(Other engines start)

39:06.296 --> 39:08.755
(Faz, laughing) It's easy, cuz.
Don't sweat it.

39:08.855 --> 39:10.714
(Laughing) Fuck off!

39:10.814 --> 39:13.233
The GPS tells you
where to go anyway.

39:13.333 --> 39:15.631
Customer's there waiting.

39:15.731 --> 39:18.590
Just like delivering a pizza,
but with drugs.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.429
Plus, there's perks to it.

39:20.529 --> 39:22.628
- (Laughs)
- Hm, like what?

39:22.728 --> 39:24.547
Like you get
to hang out with me.

39:24.647 --> 39:26.766
(Laughing) Dickhead!

39:28.085 --> 39:31.303
(Koba)
Algerians, Vietnamese,

39:31.403 --> 39:34.502
Albanians, Somalis,

39:34.602 --> 39:37.980
Turkish, the Chinese

39:38.080 --> 39:39.499
and Kurds.

39:39.599 --> 39:42.257
Thank you all for joining me.

39:42.357 --> 39:45.516
I was hoping to gather us today
with good news.

39:46.435 --> 39:50.813
To show you a man
who had finally made the right choice.

39:50.913 --> 39:52.912
(Quiet suspenseful music)

39:54.591 --> 40:01.387
Unfortunately, I'm now showing you
two men that didn't.

40:03.346 --> 40:05.465
What the fuck, Edward?

40:10.223 --> 40:15.300
Thankfully, someone else
has stepped in for you.

40:17.739 --> 40:21.037
(Luan groaning)
You... traitor!

40:21.137 --> 40:24.435
You fucking traitor!

40:24.535 --> 40:26.854
You fucking traitor!

40:35.769 --> 40:39.467
(Lale on radio) Merwan confirmed
all the leaders are there.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.986
Copy that.
Green team en route to Edgware.

40:42.086 --> 40:44.705
Black Team seven minutes eta
for Chinatown.

40:44.805 --> 40:47.223
(Lale)
Is everyone on schedule?

40:47.323 --> 40:49.302
Yellow Team nearing Islington.

40:49.402 --> 40:51.501
Blue Team approaching
Walthamstow.

40:51.601 --> 40:54.619
- Red Team entering Lambeth.
- Silver Team in Docklands.

40:54.719 --> 40:58.238
(Lale) Let me know
when you're all in position.

41:02.355 --> 41:05.674
(All teams)
In position.

41:12.750 --> 41:16.708
(Lale) All teams stand by
and await my signal.

41:18.387 --> 41:21.385
Then we strike as one.

41:26.823 --> 41:29.281
(Saba) Are you sure
this is the right place though?

41:29.381 --> 41:31.380
(Faz)
It's what it says on the GPS.

41:31.900 --> 41:36.457
(Saba) Looks like everyone's been
sent the same delivery address.

41:38.496 --> 41:42.654
- (Luan) You fucking traitor!
- (Koba) Don't criticise Afrim!

41:43.534 --> 41:45.533
He cooperated.

41:46.892 --> 41:49.111
His wife will not die.

41:49.211 --> 41:51.210
Tamaz, please.

41:52.609 --> 41:54.608
Get me out!

41:55.647 --> 41:58.006
Get me out of here!

41:59.645 --> 42:03.723
(Screams)
Get me out of here!

42:05.602 --> 42:07.881
(Luan sobbing)

42:08.681 --> 42:11.159
(Mirlinda)
Motherfucker!

42:13.358 --> 42:16.316
- Motherfucker!
- (Luan sobbing)

42:19.275 --> 42:20.814
(Ed)
Enough!

42:20.914 --> 42:23.992
If you're going to kill us,
get on with it.

42:25.831 --> 42:31.049
(Lale) Think of your families in
our homeland. Money will come soon.

42:31.149 --> 42:33.767
When we go,
we go as one.

42:33.867 --> 42:37.165
Without fear, without care.
Power will be ours!

42:37.265 --> 42:39.824
(Saba)
Is this car one of ours?

42:47.340 --> 42:49.239
- Hey, Faz.
- What you doing here, bro?

42:49.339 --> 42:51.358
Why we all here?

42:51.458 --> 42:52.837
(Cries out)

42:52.937 --> 42:56.775
This is about making
a vital point, Eddie.

42:58.095 --> 43:00.253
(Luan coughing and spluttering)

43:02.812 --> 43:06.850
I am building something
great in this city.

43:07.570 --> 43:09.608
(Lale)
Awaiting Merwan's signal.

43:19.004 --> 43:23.281
(Koba) Those of you who cooperate
will see the benefits.

43:24.361 --> 43:27.479
But those who insult me...

43:37.194 --> 43:39.193
(Lale)
That's it. We go now!

43:41.232 --> 43:43.711
Go, go, go!

43:47.429 --> 43:49.008
- Got an order.
- What?

43:49.108 --> 43:51.107
(Gunfire)

44:01.021 --> 44:03.100
(Shouting)

44:07.018 --> 44:09.017
(Banging on door)

44:30.006 --> 44:32.865
(Panicked shouting)

44:32.965 --> 44:34.964
(Alarm bell ringing)

44:39.321 --> 44:41.320
(Groaning)

44:44.639 --> 44:46.637
(Groaning)

44:58.151 --> 45:00.150
(Koba)
Who is it?

45:01.470 --> 45:03.129
Black Team, mission complete.

45:03.229 --> 45:05.228
Red Team, mission complete.

45:09.066 --> 45:11.065
Green Team, complete.

45:43.048 --> 45:45.287
(Alarm bell ringing)

45:46.846 --> 45:49.005
(Distant voices shouting)

45:55.361 --> 45:57.360
Come out.

45:58.880 --> 46:02.418
(Luan) Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

46:02.518 --> 46:04.936
- Help me, please.
- (Ed) No.

46:05.036 --> 46:08.674
- Go!
- (Luan) We must take Ed.

46:37.939 --> 46:39.938
(Roars)

46:49.253 --> 46:50.392
(Explosion)

46:50.492 --> 46:52.551
(Reporter) Police are unable
to confirm the cause

46:52.651 --> 46:56.269
of multiple explosions and fires
that have rocked the city tonight.

46:56.369 --> 46:58.988
Reports of gunfire
and armed street battles

46:59.088 --> 47:01.986
suggest the return
of gang warfare to the capital.

47:02.086 --> 47:06.144
One eyewitness described the scene
to our reporter with these words:

47:06.244 --> 47:08.143
"London is on fire."

47:08.243 --> 47:10.642
(Helicopter whirring)

47:15.399 --> 47:17.398
(Fire crackling)

47:18.078 --> 47:21.436
Move, move!
Move, move, move, move!

47:24.235 --> 47:26.234
On your knees!

47:38.667 --> 47:41.426
(Sean) I need you to deliver
a message to Koba.

47:42.905 --> 47:45.264
Tell him tonight was just the start.

47:46.823 --> 47:50.321
Tell him Sean Wallace
is coming for him

47:50.421 --> 47:52.420
and everything he touches.

47:54.899 --> 47:57.017
(Whispers) I'm taking London back.

48:18.726 --> 48:21.005
(Helicopter whirring)

48:45.312 --> 48:48.191
(Creaking)

48:50.229 --> 48:52.228
(Thud)

48:53.148 --> 48:55.147
(Sobbing)

49:11.458 --> 49:13.457
(Thunder rumbling)

49:15.056 --> 49:17.095
(Cries out)

49:19.574 --> 49:21.573
(Mirlinda coughs)

49:23.652 --> 49:26.710
(He roars)

49:26.810 --> 49:29.809
(Mirlinda crying)
It's okay.
