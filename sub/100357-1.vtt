- JULIETTE: You know that moment
when you realize

00:04.605 --> 00:05.971
there's no going back,

00:06.073 --> 00:08.207
and that your life
is forever changed?

00:08.309 --> 00:10.175
That was me at the
end of last summer.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.878
My heart truly broke
for the first time.

00:12.980 --> 00:15.848
Alex and I were together
on and off for three years.

00:15.950 --> 00:17.249
There were a lot of good times.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.784
Do you want it
to be just you and me?

00:18.886 --> 00:19.985
- Yeah.

00:20.087 --> 00:21.286
- JULIETTE: But a lot
of dark ones, too.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.921
Is it not obvious
that I don't want you

00:23.024 --> 00:24.456
hooking up with my friends?

00:24.558 --> 00:26.992
- This is how he always
gets away with murder,

00:27.094 --> 00:29.461
because he makes
the girl feel guilty.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.430
- JULIETTE: It was so
hard for me to let go.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.699
I literally walked in on
him sleeping with a girl.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.100
- How did you [bleep]?

00:35.202 --> 00:37.369
- You literally treat
other random women better than

00:37.471 --> 00:39.938
you treat your own girlfriend.
- I treat you like a princess.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.140
I made a mistake.
- Really?

00:41.242 --> 00:42.908

a million [bleep] times.

was my first love.

But it's finally over.

I don't trust you.

We should not see each

up my mind to start over.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.378
- I have some plans. Um...

01:53.481 --> 01:55.914
- I would love to see
you go on to law school,

01:56.016 --> 01:57.449
something like--

01:57.551 --> 01:59.318
because I think you have the
skill set for these sorts of--

01:59.420 --> 02:02.921
- So my friend's opening up
a boutique in Siesta Key.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.090
It's called Blend.
- Blend?

02:05.192 --> 02:06.959
- Gonna see how
I feel about fashion

02:07.061 --> 02:08.560
and if it's something
I'm interested in.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.130
- Really? You're just
gonna be selling clothes?

02:12.833 --> 02:14.466
- JULIETTE: It's so much more
than just selling clothes.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.668
I'll be doing the
buying, the marketing.

02:16.770 --> 02:20.172
She wants to open in LA, New
York, and create a big brand.

02:20.274 --> 02:23.308
So I'm really excited
to be a part of that.

02:23.410 --> 02:26.078
But I'm kind of nervous to go
back to Siesta Key, though,

02:26.180 --> 02:28.447
because, you know,
it's Alex's world and--

02:28.549 --> 02:31.216
- Have you talked to
him at all lately?

02:31.318 --> 02:34.119
- I haven't talked to
Alex in a long time.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.155
Like, no communication.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.257
I hear he's in Europe
for the summer.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.959
- It was really hard
to see you last summer.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.895
- Yeah.
- It was painful.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.663
- It was miserable.
- It was miserable.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.900
- I'm not over him completely.
But I'm just gonna live my life.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.869
And I met this guy, Robby.
- Oh.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.172
- JULIETTE: Oh, yeah.
I kind of have a new boyfriend.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.141
And he might look
a little familiar.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.310
Yup, Robby was on

Can you believe that me
and Kelsey are roommates?

04:15.489 --> 04:17.923
What's even crazier is
we're actually friends.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.626
We got really close after we
realized that our past drama

04:20.728 --> 04:22.661
was all just so dumb.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.483
So where do you and Robby stand?

04:44.585 --> 04:48.186
- Can you stop it?
We're a thing.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.855
We're a thing.
- Yeah.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.189
- But, like, I'm kind of worried

04:51.292 --> 04:53.725
'cause Alex and Robby
used to be friends.

04:53.827 --> 04:54.793
- Yikes.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.028
- JULIETTE: Yes,
you heard right.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.129
My new boyfriend used to be

04:57.231 --> 04:58.930
friends with Alex
back in the day.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.332
But I met him through Kelsey,

05:00.434 --> 05:03.201
who is currently working
with him at Rebella.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.270
Rebella is a social media
influencing company,

05:05.372 --> 05:06.772
and he is the owner.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.941
- Our fearless leader right
here is also a part-time model.

05:10.044 --> 05:11.109
- JULIETTE: He's
hot and successful.

05:11.211 --> 05:14.046
It couldn't be more perfect.

05:14.148 --> 05:18.150
- What do you think Alex thinks
of you, like, being with Robby?

05:18.252 --> 05:20.319
- He's not happy.
- Yeah, I would--

05:20.421 --> 05:21.520
- I mean,
he's not gonna be happy

05:21.622 --> 05:23.155
if I'm with anybody, though.

05:23.257 --> 05:24.456
Truthfully, like, meeting Robby

05:24.558 --> 05:26.491
has helped me
get over Alex a lot.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.793

05:58.125 --> 05:59.157

Remember last year,

05:59.259 --> 06:01.827
how Chloe was 1,000%
Team Juliette?

06:01.929 --> 06:04.229
- It's not how a man should
treat his girlfriend.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.398
That's dsgusting.
You're disgusting.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.800
Everybody in our group knows
you cheated on Juliette.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.570
I'm the only one that's
woman enough to admit to you

06:11.672 --> 06:13.805
what everyone says
behind your back.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.041
- JULIETTE: Well, after
Alex and I broke up,

06:16.143 --> 06:19.277
Chloe jumped right
back to Team Alex.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.880
And now she and I
barely even talk.

06:23.217 --> 06:26.051
- Well, Alex said that pretty
much all he brought to Europe

06:26.153 --> 06:27.686
was camo, shorts,
and t-shirts.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.488
Like, everyone in
Europe dresses so nice.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.655
So I was like, okay, well,

06:30.758 --> 06:33.158
let me go get you
some higher-end stuff.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.459
- This was so sweet
of you, Chloe.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.594
What do we owe you?

06:35.696 --> 06:37.662
- Oh, he left me a
credit card, actually.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.232
- Oh, well, you
should treat yourself.

06:40.334 --> 06:43.602
- Well, maybe I will.
- You deserve it.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.971
- JULIETTE: What's even crazier
is she's running around town

06:46.073 --> 06:50.442
acting like she's Mrs. Kompo.
It's so delusional.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.277
- But it looks like
he's having so much fun.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.545
- I think he needed it,

06:53.647 --> 06:55.714
to get his mind off of
everything with Juliette.

06:55.816 --> 06:59.184
And that relationship,
it was just so toxic and...

06:59.286 --> 07:01.086
- Oh, I agree.
- Have you seen her?

07:01.188 --> 07:03.555
- Not at all, actually.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.425
But I have been seeing,
like, on social media,

07:06.527 --> 07:08.293
I guess Juliette's
seeing someone now.

07:08.395 --> 07:11.496
His name's Robby Hayes.
- Whoa.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.064
- Robby and Juliette,
they're both posting,

07:13.167 --> 07:14.499
like, kissing pictures.

07:14.601 --> 07:18.503
And to me, it just seems like,
are you two really, like, happy?

07:18.605 --> 07:21.773
Or is it more like Juliette
trying to get back at Alex?

07:21.875 --> 07:24.843
- Yeah, rebound kind of thing.
- I mean, who knows?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.045
- Chloe's already talking
[bleep], of course.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.447
- To you?

07:28.549 --> 07:30.682
- Just I think, like,
around to people about Robby,

07:30.784 --> 07:33.018
saying Robby's
not a good person.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.087
- I mean, she also is probably
hearing this from Alex.

07:36.190 --> 07:39.458
- I'm so happy Alex and I were
able to move past everything,

07:39.560 --> 07:41.793
'cause it got so bad
between him and I.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.563
And I just felt like Juliette
always was coming to me with,

07:44.665 --> 07:46.064
like, negative,
negative, negative.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.267
And for me, I'm like, well,
this girl's my little sister.

07:49.369 --> 07:50.702
It's almost like Juliette, like,

07:50.804 --> 07:53.472
pinned Alex and I
against each other.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.840
- Chloe screwed me over.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.909
It's like, didn't you
guys hate each other?

07:58.011 --> 08:00.445
Haven't you said terrible things
to each other in the past?

08:00.547 --> 08:02.747
- I feel like she
always wants power.

08:02.850 --> 08:07.152
- When Alex comes back to town,
those two are gonna be trouble.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.420
- CHLOE: I don't know.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.188
I'm honestly kind of hurt
by her because, you know,

08:10.290 --> 08:11.623
I was there for her so much.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.726
And now Juliette
doesn't call me at all.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.760
- Oh my gosh.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.963
- Now she's having
graduation party.

08:18.065 --> 08:21.533
And she invited me, so, like,
I'm excited to see her,

08:21.635 --> 08:23.535
and, like, maybe see
where her head's at.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.770
- You'll have to get the
T about what's going on.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.672
- Oh, yeah.
You know I'll tell you.

08:27.774 --> 08:32.077
[laughs] I'm excited to see
everyone and, like, Madisson.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.514
She's been, like, taking acting
classes and all that in LA.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.916
And she's been out there
for, like, all of winter.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.751
- That's awesome.

- I want to try a Manhattan.
- You should try a Manhattan.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.470
- I feel like that makes
me very sophisticated.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.138
Baby, look what
you've done to me.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.341
- JULIETTE: We've all
changed since last summer.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.977
Especially Madisson.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.014
- I mean, would you be willing
to give it another shot?

09:09.116 --> 09:10.382
- Yeah.

09:10.484 --> 09:13.518
- JULIETTE: After last summer,
Madisson totally bailed on BG,

09:13.620 --> 09:15.921
and left Siesta Key for LA.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.523
She said it was to
take acting classes,

09:18.625 --> 09:20.725
but I'd say it was
because of a man.

09:20.827 --> 09:21.726
- [laughs]

09:21.828 --> 09:23.395
- JULIETTE: No, a literal man.

09:23.497 --> 09:24.663
- [laughs]

09:24.765 --> 09:26.798
- I love you.
- We're not there yet.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.433
- Shut up!
Shut the [bleep] up!

09:28.535 --> 09:30.869
- Just kidding.
I love you [bleep] too.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.705
- JULIETTE: I bet you're
wondering whose dad this is.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.741
But no, this is
Madisson's new boyfriend.

09:36.843 --> 09:41.479
And this is where it gets weird.
He used to be our producer.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.449
As in, the producer of
the show you're watching.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.418
When he worked with us
way back in the beginning,

09:46.520 --> 09:48.153
we all knew Madisson
had a crush on him.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.556
But none of us ever thought
they would start dating.

09:51.658 --> 09:52.857
And now that he lives in LA,

09:52.960 --> 09:54.960
I guess Madisson
couldn't stay away.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.661
- When you go home,
what are you gonna do?

09:56.763 --> 09:57.829
- You know, I wanna, like,

09:57.931 --> 10:00.031
be able to tell everyone
that we're...

10:00.133 --> 10:01.733
- Dating?

10:01.835 --> 10:06.638
- So, can you come
see everybody in Siesta Key

10:06.740 --> 10:08.473
before you go off to Canada?

10:08.575 --> 10:11.242
- Um...
- MADISSON: What?

10:13.146 --> 10:16.648
- I mean, I would--
listen, here's the thing.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.750
It's gonna be awkward.
And I know, like, you know--

10:18.852 --> 10:20.418
I just don't want it to be
uncomfortable for you.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.853
- No, and I get that.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.955
But, like, I want everyone to
see us in the context of dating

10:24.057 --> 10:26.658
rather than you just being
a producer on the show.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.960
- I'm not your producer anymore.
- MADISSON: I know that.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.296
That's what I want
people to see.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.633
- [indistinct chatter]

10:34.735 --> 10:36.601
- I think I could
probably make it work.

10:36.703 --> 10:40.038
- Really?
- ISH: Yeah.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.008
It's gonna throw
a lot of people off.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.510
- But, like, in a
good way, I hope.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.178
- Well, I think good and bad.
- Yeah.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.082
- My biggest concern is not
so much your group of friends.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.652
But my biggest concern
is more your parents.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.687
- I think the age is gonna
be the biggest thing.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.522
- You know, whatever.

10:57.624 --> 11:01.660
People can either
accept it or [bleep] off.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.331

11:06.433 --> 11:07.932
- He's your boyfriend?

11:08.035 --> 11:10.535
I'm gonna freak the [bleep] out!

11:10.637 --> 11:12.203
- One, you're not
my type of person.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.605
- You're not mine either.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.240
- CHLOE: Everything that
came out of his mouth,

11:15.342 --> 11:17.609
it just seems like
he's full of it.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.844
- When you dumped me,
that was devastating.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.646
- It's not what I wanted to do.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.148

He gets to meet you and see Mom.

And then he's gonna

- Well, have you seen
Madisson recently?

13:29.910 --> 13:31.276
- BRANDON: No, man.
Last time I talked to her

13:31.378 --> 13:34.279
is when she said she doesn't
want to do this anymore.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.281
And then she moved to
LA to go model and act.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.551

to another guy out there and--

who the dude is.

are going to be roommates.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.283
Good luck with that, Madisson.

believe you're finally here.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.222
- And I wanna hear everything.

14:17.324 --> 14:20.091
I feel like I've missed out on
all of the Siesta Key gossip.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.127
- You definitely know that Alex
and Juliette are broken up,

14:23.230 --> 14:25.063
done, done, done.
- Oh, for sure, yeah.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.998
- Do you know about Robby?
He grew up here.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.367
- --on "The Bachelorette."
He used to live in Siesta Key.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.802
- Yeah.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.337
- And now he started this
influencer business, Rebella.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.638
Contacted Kelsey.

14:33.740 --> 14:34.873
Now that Kelsey's
friends with him,

14:34.975 --> 14:36.307
now he's been
introduced to Juliette.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.277
- I think the fact she's moving
on with somebody that used to be

14:39.379 --> 14:41.779
good friends with Alex
could be a problem.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.715
I mean, Alex has, like,
mentioned to me, like,

14:43.817 --> 14:46.317
"I don't know who this
Robby kid thinks he is."

14:46.419 --> 14:47.352
- Okay, wait.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.319
That means you're
talking to Alex.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.621
- CHLOE: Mm-hmm.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.723
I mean, the only reason
we really weren't friends

14:51.825 --> 14:54.626
is because I just
couldn't stand to

14:54.728 --> 14:57.395
watch him treat Juliette
the way he did.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.497
- That relationship brought
out the worst in both of them.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.000
- I mean, if she has a problem
with me being friends with Alex

15:02.102 --> 15:05.637
again, like,
that's on her, so...

15:05.739 --> 15:06.771

- Thank you.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.039

- Yeah.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.908

15:27.093 --> 15:29.560
[laughs]

15:29.663 --> 15:30.795
- I can't.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.330
- Like, do you remember
him from season one?

15:32.432 --> 15:35.500
- I can't!
You guys, I'm gonna freak out.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.968

16:00.360 --> 16:01.859

- The shaved head.

16:08.034 --> 16:09.667

16:20.013 --> 16:21.679
- Okay.
- So... [giggles]

16:21.781 --> 16:23.047
- How old is he?

16:28.088 --> 16:29.921
- That's fine.
He could be our dad.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.290
- Shut the [bleep] up.
Shut the [bleep] up.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.026
- I'm freaking the
[bleep] out, Madisson.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.195
- Yeah, I'm--I'm a little
bit nervous to, like,

16:37.297 --> 16:38.796
bring him to Juliette's
graduation party.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.733
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Does Brandon not know?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.301
- I haven't told Brandon yet.

16:43.403 --> 16:44.802
Like, yes, I'm nervous
to tell Brandon.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.604
Like, I don't wanna

- JULIETTE: Garrett and Cara
ended last summer on the rocks.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.279
- It's my party and
you're standing there

17:28.381 --> 17:30.782
with your [bleep] ex-girlfriend.
You stupid [bleep].

17:30.884 --> 17:33.051
Like, do you think at all?!
- Do you?!

17:33.153 --> 17:34.152
- JULIETTE: And it didn't help

17:34.254 --> 17:36.387
that Cara fled to Jersey
right after that.

17:36.489 --> 17:40.124
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.427
- CARA: You're not gonna be
going on any dates, are you?

17:42.529 --> 17:45.263
- JULIETTE: I guess they were
kind of on and off all year.

17:45.365 --> 17:49.467
But word is they barely spoke
the whole time she was away.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.236
Now Cara's back in
Siesta for the summer.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.872
And from what I hear, they're
just gonna try to pick up

17:54.974 --> 17:56.674
from where they left off.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.010
- Pretty.
- How was Jersey?

18:00.814 --> 18:01.979
- Good.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.414
You wouldn't know that
'cause you never asked.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.882
But it was fun.

18:07.954 --> 18:11.422
- What, uh--what else is new?
- Nothing.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.958
I know Juliette's graduation
party is coming up.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.193
- It should be fun.
- Yeah.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.661
- Being around
everybody again.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.728
- Yeah, I know.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.997
I don't know if
I'm ready for it.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.167
I'm, like, so not
excited to see Kelsey.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.438
- Okay. I get it.
You don't like her.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.340
You don't got to tell me.
- Okay, I won't.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.075
- It should just be,
like, left alone.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.945
- I don't go out of my way
to have problems with her.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.680
- I mean, if you don't
like the girl's name,

18:35.782 --> 18:37.748
then keep it out of
your mouth, then.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.650
- Ew, can you stop
defending her?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.119
Keep her name out of my mouth?

18:41.221 --> 18:42.520
- Yeah, like,
don't talk about her

18:42.622 --> 18:43.888
if you don't want to, you know--

18:43.990 --> 18:45.890
- Just keep defending
your skanky ex-girlfriend,

18:45.992 --> 18:47.525
that's fine.
- I'm not defending her.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.693
Stop thinking that.

18:51.030 --> 18:54.532
- I don't like her.
I don't like her talking to you.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.068
- [chuckles] All right, well,
obviously we have things

18:57.170 --> 19:01.772

then have to be away
from each other?

20:03.036 --> 20:05.203
It's not ideal.

dating this Robby kid.
- CARA: Oh, it's weird.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.670
- All I really know about him is
he used to hang out with, like,

22:19.772 --> 22:21.672
Alex back in high school.
- Yeah.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.674
- CHLOE: And then I really
don't know anything about him

22:23.776 --> 22:25.976
other than he was, like,
on "The Bachelorette"

22:26.079 --> 22:28.079
and, like--I heard
he lies about his age.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.547
- Really?
- Really.

22:29.649 --> 22:33.484
He tells everyone he's 29.
And he's, like, 32 or something.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.319
- Oh, god, he's one of
those kids that, like,

22:35.421 --> 22:37.154
can't get out of his 20's.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.090
- I have an empty fridge.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.257
Do you wanna take
me grocery shopping?

22:40.360 --> 22:41.926
- Mm-hmm.
- That's a quick yes.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.127
Let's do it.

22:43.229 --> 22:44.562
- I was planning on
doing that anyway.

22:44.664 --> 22:48.232
- He's saying 6'1.
It's no way this guy's 6'1.

22:48.334 --> 22:50.201
His all-time favorite films
include

22:50.303 --> 22:52.336
"The Wolf of Wall Street."

22:52.438 --> 22:54.939
Isn't that where they,
like, con people for money?

22:55.041 --> 22:57.441
- [laughs] Yes. It is.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.310
- So, where are you
going with Rebella?

22:59.412 --> 23:02.179
Do you have, like, high hopes?
- Very high hopes.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.482
I'm buying an island right
next to Richard Branson

23:04.584 --> 23:06.617
and we'll just, you know,
hang out there all the time.

23:06.719 --> 23:07.718
- Yeah?

23:07.820 --> 23:10.354
- And it's for, you know,
being just a year old,

23:10.456 --> 23:12.390
I think we're in
a fantastic place.

23:12.492 --> 23:13.391
- You are?

23:13.493 --> 23:16.293
- Does Juliette not
find any of that odd?

23:16.396 --> 23:19.430
- I have no idea, because guess
who hasn't even texted me

23:19.532 --> 23:21.699
in the last,
like, month and a half?

23:21.801 --> 23:23.300
It's honestly a little hurtful.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.370
But I just don't think, like,
her graduation is the time

23:26.472 --> 23:29.240
to sit her down and be like,
what's going on with me and you?

23:29.342 --> 23:31.075
Because I'm feeling neglected.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.743
- I agree with that,
'cause that's, like, her day.

23:32.845 --> 23:33.944
You want her to
have a good time.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.312
So maybe...

23:35.415 --> 23:36.847
- I'll just sit Robby down
and grill him instead.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.082
- So are you looking forward to

23:38.184 --> 23:39.583
meeting my friends
at the grad party?

23:39.685 --> 23:43.821
- Is, uh, Alex gonna be there?
- He shouldn't be there.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.025
- ROBBY: I know Alex.
We were friends.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.694
Helped him on his boat.
I met his parents.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.597
A weak man will never
be able to handle a woman

23:53.699 --> 23:55.833
with a strong personality.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.501
- I like that that's
how you think.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.103
- Even though he knows
exactly what you represent.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.604
You're beautiful.

24:00.706 --> 24:03.707
You're well educated.
You deserve better.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.776
- CHLOE: I'm gonna be nice.
But you know me.

24:05.878 --> 24:09.213
I can read people and I can
smell their bull[bleep].

24:09.315 --> 24:11.348
- But I think everyone can
smell this kid's bull[bleep].

24:11.451 --> 24:13.584
Like, something's
just a little bit off.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.352

35:09.108 --> 35:11.808

of tension's happening.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.777
- Kelsey's a [bleep] psycho.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.379
She's a liar and a cheater
and everybody calls her out,

35:16.482 --> 35:18.548
and she doesn't want
to admit it to anybody.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.749
- Why are you mad?

35:19.852 --> 35:21.184
You shouldn't go out

defending her?

your skanky ex-girlfriend?

- Like, you should say sorry.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.701
I don't want you to
involve yourself--

35:37.803 --> 35:40.270
- You have no [bleep] room
to put your two cents into

35:40.372 --> 35:41.705
anything, because
can I just, like,

35:41.807 --> 35:43.273
tell you something that I feel

35:43.375 --> 35:44.975
that you obviously
don't understand?

35:45.077 --> 35:46.510
When you dumped me,

35:46.612 --> 35:49.646
I thought we were
on top of the [bleep] world.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.982
So that was devastating.
- It's not what I wanted to do.

35:52.084 --> 35:54.518

be with somebody,

36:01.426 --> 36:02.526
you don't keep bringing that up.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.628

how it looks on my end.

It just seems like you're
not putting in any effort in.

you say that I don't.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.037

with a new nose job

36:14.139 --> 36:15.472

to say about it?

36:15.574 --> 36:16.873

36:16.975 --> 36:18.141
I didn't say anything
'cause you should know how--

36:18.243 --> 36:19.876
- That's like if you showed
up with a buzz cut

36:19.978 --> 36:21.444
and I said nothing about it.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.513
Obviously I don't
[bleep] like it.

- That's a self-insecurity
that I can't change.
