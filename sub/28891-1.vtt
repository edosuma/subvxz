(LAUGHING)

00:31.535 --> 00:35.051
Alright, so, Mano e mano

00:35.693 --> 00:38.356
how many girls ask you if
Picasso is your real name?

00:39.161 --> 00:40.626
More than I'd like to talk about.

00:41.039 --> 00:42.825
Especially since a lot
of them argue with me

00:42.827 --> 00:44.586
when I tell 'em it is my real name.

00:44.588 --> 00:46.515
Like, how are you gonna
tell me what my name is?

00:46.517 --> 00:48.283
I think I know more about it than you do.

00:50.683 --> 00:51.516
She's cute.

00:52.504 --> 00:54.964
I bet you 20 bones she has a kid.

00:54.966 --> 00:57.084
How can you tell that from
one inconspicuous photo?

00:57.086 --> 00:59.934
Always trust the bubbling stomach.

00:59.936 --> 01:01.184
Why is your stomach bubbling?

01:01.186 --> 01:02.019
Just scroll.

01:06.763 --> 01:09.294
Illmatic, you're right.

01:09.296 --> 01:10.874
Of all the photos you're
gonna post of your kid,

01:10.876 --> 01:14.174
why would you post the one
directly after you gave birth?

01:14.176 --> 01:15.204
She looks hideous.

01:15.206 --> 01:17.724
I guess she was going for
the natural beauty thing.

01:17.726 --> 01:20.014
Nothing beautiful about that.

01:20.016 --> 01:21.734
Is that her placenta?

01:21.736 --> 01:23.524
Gladly swiping left.

01:23.526 --> 01:24.564
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:24.566 --> 01:26.254
Okay, which one is she?

01:26.256 --> 01:29.814
Every photo is her with
the same four girls.

01:29.816 --> 01:31.084
I'm trying to find Ms. Right Now

01:31.086 --> 01:33.024
and she wants to play
where's fucking Waldo?

01:33.026 --> 01:34.584
I detest that shit.

01:34.586 --> 01:35.474
You know when girls do that,

01:35.476 --> 01:36.764
it's usually 'cause they're the ugliest

01:36.766 --> 01:37.836
one out of the group of friends.

01:37.838 --> 01:38.669
Mhmm.

01:38.671 --> 01:41.624
Then it must be this one.

01:41.626 --> 01:43.834
Duff, you have been spotted.

01:43.836 --> 01:45.949
Ooh, she looks like fuckin' Beetlejuice.

01:45.951 --> 01:47.387
(LAUGHING)

01:47.389 --> 01:48.306
She does!

01:49.316 --> 01:50.779
To the left, to the left.

01:51.886 --> 01:53.854
Oh yeah, you're 25.

01:53.856 --> 01:54.906
25 times two!

01:54.908 --> 01:57.554
(LAUGHING)

01:57.556 --> 01:58.654
Oh, here we go.

01:58.656 --> 02:00.164
Officially head over heels.

02:00.166 --> 02:02.194
Check it out, a close up of her eye.

02:02.196 --> 02:05.514
And, yep, that's her only photo.

02:05.516 --> 02:06.804
Who wouldn't wanna swipe right?

02:06.806 --> 02:07.639
Beats me.

02:10.006 --> 02:11.806
Oh, hold on, let me see something.

02:13.376 --> 02:16.884
You've got quite a few
messages, Master Picasso.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.484
A lot more than I thought you'd have.

02:18.486 --> 02:19.317
Well, if you open up the conversation,

02:19.319 --> 02:21.704
you'll see they're mostly just lonely heys

02:21.706 --> 02:23.174
that no one ever responded to.

02:23.176 --> 02:25.754
You can't just say hey to these girls.

02:25.756 --> 02:27.824
The second you match with them you gotta

02:27.826 --> 02:29.214
do something to show
them you're not just one

02:29.216 --> 02:31.714
of the millions of guys that
wanna make bacon with them.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.154
But I do wanna make bacon with them.

02:33.156 --> 02:33.987
Well, you're not gonna put anything

02:33.989 --> 02:37.044
in the pan with a dry fuckin' DM like hey.

02:37.046 --> 02:42.134
Every hot girl's DM is 50%
lewd messages, 50% heys.

02:42.136 --> 02:43.104
You gotta find the middle ground.

02:43.106 --> 02:44.454
You gotta do something unique.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.369
Well, my heys did work on someone.

02:47.856 --> 02:49.414
Oh, this girl, Sisanie?

02:49.416 --> 02:50.324
Yeah.

02:50.326 --> 02:51.801
We've been talking for like two weeks,

02:51.803 --> 02:54.104
And I can actually keep a
conversation going with her.

02:54.106 --> 02:57.294
No lags, no pretending to be interested.

02:57.296 --> 02:58.874
I mean, it's a good deal.

02:58.876 --> 03:00.119
We text, like, everyday.

03:00.968 --> 03:02.174
Have you guys meet in person yet?

03:02.176 --> 03:03.764
No.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.744
Is a face to face meeting in the works?

03:05.746 --> 03:06.579
Nope.

03:14.312 --> 03:15.334
Dude, will you stop?

03:15.336 --> 03:16.331
What is that for?

03:16.333 --> 03:17.514
That's for preferring to talk

03:17.516 --> 03:19.504
to an attractive young woman on your phone

03:19.506 --> 03:21.774
than talking to her
pussy lips in real time!

03:21.776 --> 03:23.414
I've seen Catfish!

03:23.416 --> 03:24.787
And if I've learned
anything from Nev and Max

03:24.789 --> 03:28.084
it's that anything that seems
too good, really is too good.

03:28.086 --> 03:30.144
Right now, this girl's
on a pillar, you know.

03:30.146 --> 03:32.564
She's cool, she's chill,
and I don't wanna ruin

03:32.566 --> 03:34.924
what we have by meeting her in person.

03:34.926 --> 03:36.474
What if she's a guy?

03:36.476 --> 03:38.124
Or what if she is who she says she is,

03:38.126 --> 03:40.234
but her real life personality pales

03:40.236 --> 03:42.804
in comparison to her online personality.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.544
When I'm not looking for girls to fuck,

03:44.546 --> 03:46.464
I can just sit back, unwind,

03:46.466 --> 03:48.116
and shoot the shit with Sisanie.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.834
What, the, stop, stop!

03:51.836 --> 03:53.744
What the fuck kinda logic is that?

03:53.746 --> 03:56.014
This girl responded to your boring ass hey

03:56.016 --> 03:58.784
and has sustained a
conversation with you for weeks.

03:58.786 --> 03:59.674
She's pretty.

03:59.676 --> 04:01.314
She clearly likes the same things as you.

04:01.316 --> 04:03.634
Look, she's got a Courage
the Cowardly Dog shirt

04:03.636 --> 04:04.714
for crying out loud.

04:04.716 --> 04:06.833
This girl will fuck the
potatoes out of you.

04:06.835 --> 04:07.854
Dude, but what if she's a catfish?

04:07.856 --> 04:09.794
What if she's not a catfish?

04:09.796 --> 04:14.454
Picasso, listen to me
with both ears, alright?

04:14.456 --> 04:17.084
If you haven't at least
discussed the possibility

04:17.086 --> 04:19.793
of meeting this girl in person
by the next time I see you,

04:19.796 --> 04:22.564
I will personally give you a vasectomy

04:22.566 --> 04:25.059
with a rusty safety pin, capiche?

04:26.586 --> 04:30.134
Her vagina is calling your name, dude.

04:30.136 --> 04:34.105
Oh, Picasso, oh, Picasso.

04:34.107 --> 04:34.938
What are you doing?

04:34.940 --> 04:36.588
Just give me that salami.

04:36.590 --> 04:37.421
Stop, just stop.

04:37.423 --> 04:39.194
Just give me that sausage.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.470
I can take it.

04:40.472 --> 04:42.435
Come on, shove it in there, big boy!

04:42.437 --> 04:43.711
Stop it, stop it please!

04:43.713 --> 04:45.134
Come on, shiver me timbers!

04:45.136 --> 04:47.168
(LAUGHING)

04:47.170 --> 04:48.170

06:02.006 --> 06:02.994
The fact that this is Inglewood

06:02.996 --> 06:05.144
shouldn't make a difference.

06:05.146 --> 06:07.874
It's actually not that sketch.

06:07.876 --> 06:09.169
Looks pretty nice inside.

06:10.506 --> 06:11.964
Asshole.

06:11.966 --> 06:13.794
No, but are you sure you know the plan?

06:13.796 --> 06:15.424
Because you tend to have selective memory

06:15.426 --> 06:17.649
and I wanna make sure
my plan is foolproof.

06:18.936 --> 06:22.624
Okay, sad face means call
me so I can make an exit

06:22.626 --> 06:25.279
elegantly, and happy
face means I can stay.

06:27.646 --> 06:30.654
Okay, fuck you very much.

06:30.656 --> 06:32.122

(PHONE BEEPING)

06:41.579 --> 06:42.429
You'll be fine.

It'll be fine.

06:48.279 --> 06:49.142
It'll be fine.

06:51.709 --> 06:54.622
Yeah, I think it'll be fine.

07:09.219 --> 07:10.050
Hi.

07:10.052 --> 07:10.885
Hey.

07:13.629 --> 07:14.462
Thank you.

07:34.669 --> 07:38.002
(ELEVATOR DOOR DINGING)

07:40.981 --> 07:41.814
Thank you.

07:44.883 --> 07:46.469
This is a fuckin' maze.

07:46.471 --> 07:47.302
Yeah.

07:47.304 --> 07:49.034
There's a side entrance
that's closer to my apartment,

07:49.036 --> 07:50.717
but I thought for the sake of presentation

07:50.719 --> 07:52.257
I might as well meet you in front.

07:52.259 --> 07:54.797
Well, you should know
that I hate walking.

07:54.799 --> 07:56.937
If I could ride around
in one of those electric

07:56.939 --> 08:00.107
shopping carts for the
rest of my life, I would.

08:00.109 --> 08:01.537
Well, we don't have any
electric shopping carts,

08:01.539 --> 08:03.767
but there's a few janky ones lying around.

08:03.769 --> 08:04.600
I could push you in one.

08:04.602 --> 08:06.487
I might just take you up on that.

08:06.489 --> 08:08.197
But only if the cart's missing a wheel

08:08.199 --> 08:09.977
and it smells like piss.

08:09.979 --> 08:11.652
Well, I'll see what I can muster up.

08:14.089 --> 08:15.777
How long have we been walking?

08:15.779 --> 08:18.347
Uh, less than a minute.

08:18.349 --> 08:19.923
My feet hurt already.

08:19.925 --> 08:21.017
You really do hate walking.

08:21.019 --> 08:22.162
I did warn you.

08:23.149 --> 08:24.987
This hallway's kinda sketch.

08:24.989 --> 08:27.157
Yeah, I thought the same thing.

08:27.159 --> 08:28.707
Sometimes when I'm by
myself, I turn around

08:28.709 --> 08:30.267
just to make sure I'm not being followed.

08:30.269 --> 08:32.177
Oh my God, imagine if you were.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.647
Like, Leatherface was just posted up

08:33.649 --> 08:36.292
at the very end of the
hallway like, sup, brah.

08:36.294 --> 08:38.971
Uh, I think I'd turn into Usain Bolt.

08:38.972 --> 08:40.857
(IMITATING RUNNING)

08:40.860 --> 08:41.693
Not today!

08:43.179 --> 08:44.010
See, not me.

08:44.011 --> 08:46.177
I am one of those people
that would royally

08:46.179 --> 08:48.377
piss off the horror movie audience.

08:48.379 --> 08:49.847
I'd just wait to be killed.

08:49.849 --> 08:51.973
I mean, what is the point in wasting

08:51.975 --> 08:54.287
Leatherface's time giving this illusion

08:54.289 --> 08:56.927
that I am capable of
engaging in a foot chase.

08:56.929 --> 08:59.767
Nope, just cut me open, I can handle it.

08:59.769 --> 09:02.157
You sure about that?

09:02.159 --> 09:03.527
Nope.

09:03.529 --> 09:05.647
This hallway so reminds
me of The Shining though.

09:05.649 --> 09:06.480
Yeah.

09:06.482 --> 09:07.487
Well, if they ever do another remake,

09:07.489 --> 09:08.577
they could do it right here.

09:08.579 --> 09:10.407
Isn't that infuriating?

09:10.409 --> 09:11.967
Another remake.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.257
The Shining is one of those films

09:13.259 --> 09:15.387
that should never be remade.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.897
No one will ever come close to what

09:16.899 --> 09:18.649
Jack Nicholson was able to achieve.

09:20.889 --> 09:22.697
You were supposed to agree with me.

09:22.699 --> 09:24.597
I'm not really crazy about The Shining.

09:24.599 --> 09:26.317
Well, date's over.

09:26.319 --> 09:28.157
Oh, well, I just think it's overrated.

09:28.159 --> 09:29.567
And before you draw your sword,

09:29.569 --> 09:31.387
I'm not saying it's a bad movie.

09:31.389 --> 09:33.037
It definitely had its effective moments,

09:33.039 --> 09:36.757
but to say it was the greatest
horror movie of all time,

09:36.759 --> 09:38.057
I just don't see it.

09:38.059 --> 09:40.597
That film was style over genuine horror.

09:40.599 --> 09:43.817
Plus, Kubrick put his team through hell.

09:43.819 --> 09:46.037
If a director can't destroy the mental

09:46.039 --> 09:47.847
health of their cast and crew,

09:47.849 --> 09:49.672
they shouldn't call themselves a director.

09:49.674 --> 09:53.484
Um, that's a problematic statement.

09:53.486 --> 09:55.357
Here's what I think.

09:55.359 --> 09:57.877
Remakes give filmmakers this opportunity

09:57.879 --> 10:00.907
to resurrect previously awful movies.

10:00.909 --> 10:03.057
I mean, I can think of so
many shitty horror films

10:03.059 --> 10:05.157
that could be remade and enriched,

10:05.159 --> 10:08.647
but instead people choose
to remake the classics,

10:08.649 --> 10:12.007
the films that should have
a do not touch sign on them.

10:12.009 --> 10:13.157
You can say that again.

10:13.159 --> 10:13.992
Do I have to?

10:19.277 --> 10:20.767
Hmm, not too shabby.

10:20.769 --> 10:21.920
Not too shabby at all.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.767
This is the abode.

10:23.769 --> 10:27.177
I live in a shoebox compared to this.

10:27.179 --> 10:28.417
And you have a staircase.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.957
See, staircases in
apartments to me are just,

10:30.959 --> 10:35.227
like, a fuck you to the rest
of us studio apartment folk.

10:35.229 --> 10:38.147
Like, not one but two
of my floors are bigger

10:38.149 --> 10:39.204
than your entire living space.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.267
There's just a bedroom up there.

10:41.269 --> 10:42.354
It's not that great.

10:42.356 --> 10:44.077
But here's the test.

10:44.079 --> 10:46.367
How many bathrooms do you have?

10:46.369 --> 10:47.200
Two.

10:47.202 --> 10:49.217
Oh, that is exceptional.

10:49.219 --> 10:51.327
So one can blow up your
bathroom because you have

10:51.329 --> 10:55.107
one down here for all
visitant bowel unloads, huh?

10:55.109 --> 10:57.747
You don't even use the
downstairs bathroom, do you?

10:57.749 --> 10:59.157
Not really.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.557
You, young guy, have got it made.

11:02.559 --> 11:04.205
This apartment's not that great.

11:04.207 --> 11:06.987
I get that you're
trying to be unpresuming,

11:06.989 --> 11:10.457
but this is a pretty sick pad.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.517
I do not see one blemish.

11:12.519 --> 11:14.867
Hmm, well then you
haven't looked hard enough.

11:14.869 --> 11:17.215
Bring your eyes this away.

11:17.217 --> 11:19.067
Oh, hiya destruction.

11:19.069 --> 11:20.437
What happened here?

11:20.439 --> 11:21.777
Bronx.

11:21.779 --> 11:24.927
Bronx as in the
borough of New York City?

11:24.929 --> 11:28.317
No, Bronx as in my friend's dog, Bronx.

11:28.319 --> 11:29.617
Goddamn, Gertrude.

11:29.619 --> 11:31.847
My friend, Hut, he got himself a husky.

11:31.849 --> 11:33.379
A very unwise decision.

11:33.381 --> 11:35.017
And why is that?

11:35.019 --> 11:36.957
Huskies are cuteness overload.

11:36.959 --> 11:40.367
Like, I need to stop whatever
I'm doing and hug your face.

11:40.369 --> 11:41.200
No.

11:41.202 --> 11:42.897
The cuteness of the husky hampers people's

11:42.899 --> 11:44.957
ability to make sound decisions.

11:44.959 --> 11:47.377
My friend, Hut, got himself a husky purely

11:47.379 --> 11:50.267
on the basis that it was
his little wolfy-pie.

11:50.269 --> 11:52.307
His words not mine.

11:52.309 --> 11:54.927
Hut got this dog and didn't read up on it.

11:54.929 --> 11:57.847
Huskies are balls of energy.

11:57.849 --> 12:00.247
They get bored easily and
when they're not stimulated,

12:00.249 --> 12:02.367
it's chewin' time.

12:02.369 --> 12:05.137
Huskies are little wolfy-pies.

12:05.139 --> 12:06.777
I'd love to have a husky.

12:06.779 --> 12:08.007
They're always so happy.

12:08.009 --> 12:09.437
And their fur is like,

12:09.439 --> 12:11.887
they're like little hairy marshmallows.

12:11.889 --> 12:14.657
Well, Bronx, the hairy
little marshmallow,

12:14.659 --> 12:16.617
he'd be left alone in Hut's apartment,

12:16.619 --> 12:19.567
and in no time, he was
tearing the place apart.

12:19.569 --> 12:21.277
And Hut didn't wanna get mad at the dog

12:21.279 --> 12:23.697
because it was his pup-pup.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.607
Hut had to get a new couch, new curtains,

12:25.609 --> 12:28.917
new shoes, all thanks to Bronx.

12:28.919 --> 12:30.752
You get off Bronx's back, alright?

12:31.799 --> 12:34.787
Also, if you knew what he was capable of

12:34.789 --> 12:36.927
why'd you let him stay at your apartment.

12:36.929 --> 12:40.047
Especially since you don't
seem like a dog person.

12:40.049 --> 12:43.687
I'm not a dog person, but
I was doing a friend a favor.

12:43.689 --> 12:45.127
Hut had to go on a business trip.

12:45.129 --> 12:47.537
Plus, Hut had told me that Bronx

12:47.539 --> 12:50.277
was taking puppy training classes.

12:50.279 --> 12:53.267
So I thought I didn't have
anything to worry about.

12:53.269 --> 12:55.767
I left Bronx downstairs
while I went upstairs to bed,

12:55.769 --> 12:57.937
and the next morning,
I saw that the little

12:57.939 --> 13:01.187
wolfy-pie had snacked on my apartment.

13:01.189 --> 13:02.797
And the shedding?

13:02.799 --> 13:04.947
These guys shed like nobody's business.

13:04.949 --> 13:07.487
Just white hair clumps everywhere.

13:07.489 --> 13:10.457
Turned my living room
into an Alaskan winter.

13:10.459 --> 13:13.887
So are you gonna fix the wreckage?

13:13.889 --> 13:15.847
I got a guy coming next week.

13:15.849 --> 13:17.967
And Hut gave me money
to pay for the damages,

13:17.969 --> 13:20.987
but this looks terrible, doesn't it?

13:20.989 --> 13:23.327
Yeah, but it doesn't take away

13:23.329 --> 13:25.687
from how bitchin' this pad is.

13:25.689 --> 13:29.407
I'd still take your place
over mine any day of the week.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.787
For a second though, I
thought those scratches

13:31.789 --> 13:34.112
were the result of a
victim trying to escape.

13:37.366 --> 13:38.197
Thank you.

13:38.199 --> 13:39.030
You're welcome.

13:39.032 --> 13:40.460
I tried to go along with the last girl

13:40.462 --> 13:43.997
that made that joke, but
apparently I was too convincing

13:43.999 --> 13:46.327
because her whole demeanor changed,

13:46.329 --> 13:49.817
and she called the Uber
with the quickness.

13:49.819 --> 13:52.294
Well, this is kinda American Pyscho-y.

13:52.296 --> 13:55.427
You know, a young guy
living in a nice place

13:55.429 --> 13:57.237
by himself, none the less, right?

13:57.239 --> 13:58.637
Yeah.

13:58.639 --> 14:01.037
You could so be a serial killer.

14:01.039 --> 14:02.947
Well, the same could be said about you.

14:02.949 --> 14:04.317
People always think it's the guy

14:04.319 --> 14:06.507
who invites the girl over to kill her,

14:06.509 --> 14:07.757
but what about the girl that comes over

14:07.759 --> 14:10.287
to the guy's house to kill him?

14:10.289 --> 14:11.120
You're right.

14:11.122 --> 14:13.197
Femme fatales, they are out there.

14:13.199 --> 14:16.197
Online dating requires so much trust.

14:16.199 --> 14:19.817
My biggest fear is that
I'm gonna meet Justine,

14:19.819 --> 14:21.919
only to find out that she's really Justin.

14:23.439 --> 14:25.147
But the fact that I
could be meeting someone

14:25.149 --> 14:28.047
that could possibly end my life,

14:28.049 --> 14:30.980
or cause me great harm is something

14:30.982 --> 14:33.507
I don't think about as much as I should.

14:33.509 --> 14:37.327
Well, that's a reality
I've experienced head on.

14:37.329 --> 14:38.162
Seriously?

14:39.599 --> 14:40.432
Yeah.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.497
It was a little over 3 years ago.

14:44.499 --> 14:47.487
I met this guy on this app.

14:47.489 --> 14:49.287
It was on a different one I used to use.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.992
I don't use it anymore.

14:53.319 --> 14:55.707
But we'd been talking
for a couple of months,

14:55.709 --> 14:59.389
and I thought he was...

15:02.259 --> 15:04.297
I was trying to think of
another word for Mr. Perfect,

15:04.299 --> 15:07.072
but whatever, he was Mr. Perfect.

15:07.919 --> 15:12.919
I should've known that Mr.
Perfect is never Mr. Perfect.

15:13.229 --> 15:16.597
He was Mr. Perfect At
Pretending To Be Mr. Perfect.

15:16.599 --> 15:19.437
But anyway, we decided to meet up,

15:19.439 --> 15:24.122
and I had the bright idea of
inviting him over to my place.

15:25.289 --> 15:27.027
As soon as he got there I knew that

15:27.029 --> 15:29.107
he didn't actually want
to spend time with me.

15:29.109 --> 15:33.087
He just, he wanted to do the deed.

15:33.089 --> 15:35.847
Everything he said had
something to do with sex.

15:35.849 --> 15:40.849
And I immediately knew
this was gonna suck.

15:41.129 --> 15:45.587
So, I wanted to watch a movie
on my shitty little couch,

15:45.589 --> 15:48.977
but he insisted that
we watch it on my bed.

15:48.979 --> 15:51.407
Another trap I fell into.

15:51.409 --> 15:54.777
But, I just, I felt uncomfortable,

15:54.779 --> 15:58.077
and I thought, be nice, watch the movie,

15:58.079 --> 15:59.502
and maybe he'll go home.

16:00.889 --> 16:03.877
And not five minutes into the movie

16:03.879 --> 16:08.877
he's kissing me, and
just being really rough.

16:08.879 --> 16:11.717
And I try pushing him off,
but then he just got stronger,

16:11.719 --> 16:15.487
and he made this really
awkward eye contact,

16:15.489 --> 16:19.675
and he said, you want me to leave, right?

16:19.677 --> 16:20.907
Well, I will.

16:20.909 --> 16:22.062
Right after this.

16:23.689 --> 16:29.786
And here's the kicker,
I didn't fight back.

16:31.119 --> 16:32.607
I didn't scream.

16:32.609 --> 16:37.167
I could've done anything
in my power to get him off.

16:37.169 --> 16:40.254
I could've done all these
things I always told myself

16:40.256 --> 16:42.956
I'd do if something like
this would ever happen to me.

16:44.309 --> 16:49.309
But then I thought, I
could be the next headline

16:49.799 --> 16:51.872
on one of those Facebook articles.

16:52.759 --> 16:56.132
Woman raped and murdered by online date.

16:57.429 --> 17:02.429
So I just lied there, and I cried,

17:04.219 --> 17:07.166
and I guess that turned him off because

17:07.169 --> 17:10.006
he got off of me and left.

17:11.559 --> 17:14.952
And then he blocked me and I
never heard from him again.

17:19.059 --> 17:20.057
I'm sorry.

17:20.059 --> 17:22.487
Things just got really fuckin' dark.

17:22.489 --> 17:25.946
Note to self, don't tell
almost getting raped stories.

17:25.949 --> 17:28.617
And now I'm trying to make light of it.

17:28.619 --> 17:31.602
Oh my God, there's no coming
back from this, is there?

17:33.429 --> 17:35.571
Thanks for sharing that with me.

17:35.573 --> 17:37.637
And now you're thanking me.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.117
You don't even know what to say.

17:39.119 --> 17:40.857
Oh my God, this is like something

17:40.859 --> 17:42.807
you share on the 15th date.

17:42.809 --> 17:46.737
No, it's, you're right, I
don't know what I should be saying,

17:46.739 --> 17:50.562
but that guy's a hideous fuckin' guy.

17:51.649 --> 17:54.069
Yeah, it wasn't a great time for me.

17:54.071 --> 17:56.057
I mean, I almost stopped
online dating altogether,

17:56.059 --> 17:59.057
but it's like if you get
attacked at a grocery story

17:59.059 --> 18:00.835
are you gonna stop going food shopping?

18:00.837 --> 18:02.647
PICASSO: No.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.647
No, I'm really not trying to
make light of this, I just...

18:05.649 --> 18:07.529
No, you're fine.

18:09.329 --> 18:11.807
So, I thought I'd
give it another chance.

18:11.809 --> 18:14.397
And I know most people in my position

18:14.399 --> 18:15.957
wouldn't do that, but...

18:15.959 --> 18:16.792
You're strong.

18:19.019 --> 18:21.042
Yeah, if you say so.

18:23.468 --> 18:25.027
It took me a long-ass
time to get back here,

18:25.029 --> 18:27.907
but here I stand.

18:27.909 --> 18:30.717
And thankfully, since then all I've had

18:30.719 --> 18:32.802
to deal with is harmless losers.

18:33.778 --> 18:36.004
I hope I don't become one
of those harmless losers.

18:36.006 --> 18:38.257
Oh, only the night will tell.

18:38.259 --> 18:39.987
Okay, I know what'll get us back on track.

18:39.989 --> 18:41.097
You got any alchy?

18:41.099 --> 18:42.672
Yes, what do you want?

18:42.674 --> 18:43.505
Bud Light?

18:43.507 --> 18:44.647
No.

18:44.649 --> 18:45.480
Budweiser?

18:45.482 --> 18:47.277
Mm, No.

18:47.279 --> 18:49.047
Sam Adams?

18:49.049 --> 18:50.007
No.

18:50.009 --> 18:51.404
Okay, what do you have?

18:51.406 --> 18:53.007
I have apple ale.

18:53.009 --> 18:54.072
Anything else?

18:57.459 --> 18:58.327
No.

18:58.329 --> 19:00.937
So you asked me what I wanted when you

19:00.939 --> 19:03.610
already knew you only had
one selection of alchy.

19:03.612 --> 19:05.647
I was hoping you'd ask for apple ale.

19:05.649 --> 19:07.376
That's not even a real beer.

19:07.378 --> 19:09.257
That's like someone promising me a ticket

19:09.259 --> 19:11.387
to a Destiny's Child reunion concert

19:11.389 --> 19:13.389
only to find out Beyoncé won't be there.

19:14.659 --> 19:17.187
Michelle and Kelly are
talented in their own right.

19:17.189 --> 19:18.357
In their own right.

19:18.359 --> 19:19.897
That was such a backhanded compliment.

19:19.899 --> 19:20.947
That's not what I meant.

19:20.949 --> 19:22.177
They are talented.

19:22.179 --> 19:24.947
The only thing they did was
elevate Beyoncé's eminence.

19:24.949 --> 19:27.127
They'd sing and dance
circles around you.

19:27.129 --> 19:28.007
Well, of course they would.

19:28.009 --> 19:30.087
I'm not musically or
rhythmically inclined.

19:30.089 --> 19:33.977
I think Michelle has a great
voice, and so does Kelly.

19:33.979 --> 19:36.367
You cannot underplay their journey.

19:36.369 --> 19:38.987
Their journey on Beyoncé's back?

19:38.989 --> 19:40.127
Technical foul.

19:40.129 --> 19:41.617
Okay, but who's the first person you

19:41.619 --> 19:44.409
think of when you hear the
words, Destiny's Child?

19:44.411 --> 19:45.242
Beyoncé.

19:45.244 --> 19:47.377
No, I actually think of Michelle.

19:47.379 --> 19:49.397
Have you ever been thrown
out of your own apartment?

19:49.399 --> 19:52.607
Picasso, the only reason
Destiny's Child existed

19:52.609 --> 19:54.977
was to prepare Beyoncé for the phenomenal

19:54.979 --> 19:57.197
solo career that she was destined for.

19:57.199 --> 19:59.447
That's all any boy or girl group is.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.297
They're meant to showcase
how great the lead singer

20:01.299 --> 20:04.297
is so they can go solo
and become megastars.

20:04.299 --> 20:05.147
Look at N'Sync.

20:05.149 --> 20:06.737
Who's the first person you think of?

20:06.739 --> 20:07.570
Justin Timberlake.

20:07.572 --> 20:08.987
No, J.C.

20:08.989 --> 20:11.507
I always thought he had a
better voice than J-Timz.

20:11.509 --> 20:12.777
J-Timz?

20:12.779 --> 20:15.257
What is he, you're fucking golf buddy.

20:15.259 --> 20:16.207
Okay, fine.

20:16.209 --> 20:17.357
Forget N'Sync.

20:17.359 --> 20:18.587
What about Backstreet Boy?.

20:18.589 --> 20:19.527
Who do you think of?

20:19.529 --> 20:20.504
Brian.

20:20.506 --> 20:22.537
No, actually, AJ.

20:22.539 --> 20:24.647
Okay, now you're deliberately
disagreeing with me.

20:24.649 --> 20:26.437
You know I'm right.

20:26.439 --> 20:28.127
Okay, here we go.

20:28.129 --> 20:28.960
B2K.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.259
Who drove that group?

20:30.261 --> 20:31.197
Omarion.

20:31.199 --> 20:32.257
Yes.

20:32.259 --> 20:33.447
IMX?

20:33.449 --> 20:34.431
Marques Houston.

20:34.433 --> 20:35.264
Mhmm.

20:35.266 --> 20:36.307
H-Town?

20:36.309 --> 20:37.247
Dino.

20:37.249 --> 20:39.277
Could you imagine what that feels like?

20:39.279 --> 20:41.197
To know the group you're
in wouldn't be shit

20:41.199 --> 20:42.477
without the lead singer?

20:42.479 --> 20:44.627
To know your millions of fans are probably

20:44.629 --> 20:46.079
just fans of the lead singer.

20:47.709 --> 20:50.197
Wait, so did you still
want that apple ale?

20:50.199 --> 20:52.712
I mean, since there's
nothing else, fine.

21:05.082 --> 21:06.307
Thank you, thank you.

21:06.309 --> 21:07.142
Yep, yep.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.077
So what's the deal with your name?

21:12.079 --> 21:13.347
I gotta get to the bottom of this.

21:13.349 --> 21:14.927
What do you mean,
what's the deal with it?

21:14.929 --> 21:16.627
Is Picasso your real name?

21:16.629 --> 21:18.197
I'm sure you've answered
that a million times,

21:18.199 --> 21:19.947
but you've never answered me.

21:19.949 --> 21:21.307
My real name is Picasso.

21:21.309 --> 21:24.923
It's spelled like Picasso,
but it's pronounced pick-a-so.

21:24.925 --> 21:28.157
And who decided Picasso
was the name for you?

21:28.159 --> 21:32.217
The legend goes that my
mom had a list of names

21:32.219 --> 21:34.297
and she didn't know which one to pick.

21:34.299 --> 21:37.357
And my dad was very, very impatient.

21:37.359 --> 21:38.747
Annoyingly so.

21:38.749 --> 21:39.957
Pick!

21:39.959 --> 21:40.903
Pick!

21:40.905 --> 21:43.692
Pick a fuckin' name, you trick-ass bitch.

21:44.759 --> 21:45.887
My dad would never ever
talk to my mom like that,

21:45.889 --> 21:47.737
I was taking some creative liberties.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.507
Okay, I think I know how this ends.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.697
Your dad kept telling your
mom to pick, she got fed up,

21:52.699 --> 21:55.207
and named you Picasso
as a form of rebellion.

21:55.209 --> 21:59.052
No, Picasso was actually
one of the names on the list.

22:00.179 --> 22:03.097
24 years later and I still don't
know where she got it from.

22:03.099 --> 22:05.757
She swears it had nothing
to do with Pablo Picasso,

22:05.759 --> 22:08.127
and she gets really upset when people say,

22:08.129 --> 22:10.827
well isn't his name Picasso?

22:10.829 --> 22:12.747
She's adamant that I was named Picasso

22:12.749 --> 22:15.057
and I shouldn't let
anyone call me Picasso.

22:15.059 --> 22:16.887
Well, wouldn't she be proud.

22:16.889 --> 22:18.237
I've been calling you Picasso all night

22:18.239 --> 22:19.107
and you haven't corrected me.

22:19.109 --> 22:20.297
I don't correct anyone.

22:20.299 --> 22:23.167
I wish my name was Picasso,
that's why I answer to it.

22:23.169 --> 22:24.497
Picasso sounds like the villain

22:24.499 --> 22:26.340
in an episode of Courage the Cowardly Dog.

22:26.342 --> 22:28.537
I could so see that.

22:28.539 --> 22:33.247
For some reason I'm envisioning
a spider-like scarecrow

22:33.249 --> 22:35.647
that comes to life and
eats your happiness.

22:35.649 --> 22:36.547
Oh, I'd watch that episode.

22:36.549 --> 22:38.932
You bet your ass you'd
watch that episode.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.277
So I have something.

22:42.279 --> 22:43.282
Why online dating?

22:45.469 --> 22:47.117
Cause it's there.

22:47.119 --> 22:49.697
I feel like that's so Generation Y.

22:49.699 --> 22:51.397
We're too school for cool.

22:51.399 --> 22:54.287
We refuse to find romance
the way our parents did.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.777
We have to do it technologically.

22:56.779 --> 22:58.647
Isn't that so ironic, though?

22:58.649 --> 23:01.037
That we're connecting
with someone on a device

23:01.039 --> 23:03.982
that isolates us from any and everyone.

23:05.329 --> 23:07.227
I was so Jaden Smith just then.

23:07.229 --> 23:09.157
Wait, I have a Jaden Smithism.

23:09.159 --> 23:12.017
I wish I had a giant toilet

23:12.019 --> 23:14.116
to flush away the world's problems.

23:14.118 --> 23:14.951
Ooh!

23:16.459 --> 23:18.557
If baby goats are called kids,

23:18.559 --> 23:21.117
can kids be called baby goats?

23:21.119 --> 23:21.952
Baa!

23:23.869 --> 23:26.962
Haircuts are cranial abortions.

23:28.889 --> 23:31.199
Are we really reading books or are books

23:31.201 --> 23:32.868
BOTH: Reading us?

23:34.814 --> 23:35.857
Okay, so what about you?

23:35.859 --> 23:37.344
Why was online dating the way to go?

23:37.346 --> 23:39.207
The phone's a safety net.

23:39.209 --> 23:42.827
Online you can be anyone,
you can say anything.

23:42.829 --> 23:45.044
If you get rejected by a
girl, you can just block her.

23:45.046 --> 23:47.077
If you get shut down in real life,

23:47.079 --> 23:48.577
you gotta wallow in that defeat.

23:48.579 --> 23:50.687
You can't just act like nothing happened

23:50.689 --> 23:52.127
like you can online.

23:52.129 --> 23:54.357
Yeah, but in the same respect,

23:54.359 --> 23:56.047
when you meet someone in person,

23:56.049 --> 23:58.187
even if they're not interested,

23:58.189 --> 24:00.067
they still have to acknowledge you.

24:00.069 --> 24:02.517
At least, the mannerly
person will acknowledge you.

24:02.519 --> 24:05.527
You're there in the flesh,
making your interest known.

24:05.529 --> 24:08.057
Whereas, online you get so many messages

24:08.059 --> 24:10.337
that people don't respond to.

24:10.339 --> 24:12.087
You know, there's nothing
that compels people

24:12.089 --> 24:13.317
to give you a chance.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.467
Yeah, but there's
thousands of options online.

24:15.469 --> 24:17.143
You'll get it in eventually.

24:17.145 --> 24:17.976
Hmm.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.457
I didn't mean that.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.827
I was just like...

24:20.829 --> 24:22.462
Removes foot from mouth.

24:27.869 --> 24:29.702
Hello, nurse.

24:32.099 --> 24:33.967
Are You Afraid of the Dark?

24:33.969 --> 24:35.682
The complete series.

24:37.539 --> 24:39.357
That sounded unenthusiastic.

24:39.359 --> 24:41.857
Are You Afraid of the Dark?
Is such a whatever show.

24:41.859 --> 24:43.917
When it comes to children's
horror anthology,

24:43.919 --> 24:45.187
Goosebumps takes the cake.

24:45.189 --> 24:46.917
You think Goosebumps was a better show

24:46.919 --> 24:48.467
than Are You Afraid of the Dark?

24:48.469 --> 24:50.557
Sisanie, I'm worried about you.

24:50.559 --> 24:53.167
It was light years better
than Are You Afraid of the Dark?

24:53.169 --> 24:54.347
Ask anyone.

24:54.349 --> 24:56.637
Clearly, you need a mental
evaluation if you're gonna put

24:56.639 --> 24:59.787
Goosebumps over Are
You Afraid of the Dark?

24:59.789 --> 25:02.997
I mean, on a crappy acting scale, sure,

25:02.999 --> 25:06.287
Are You Afraid of the Dark?
had less crappy performances.

25:06.289 --> 25:07.677
But, come on.

25:07.679 --> 25:10.557
If we're talking about
the nostalgia factor,

25:10.559 --> 25:12.407
nothing will trump Goosebumps.

25:12.409 --> 25:14.167
This is a series that won the kiddies

25:14.169 --> 25:17.097
over in television and literature.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.227
Mad props to R.L. Stine, alright?

25:19.229 --> 25:20.220
Nah.

25:20.222 --> 25:21.837
There was just something so accessible

25:21.839 --> 25:23.227
about Are You Afraid of the Dark?

25:23.229 --> 25:25.547
Here you have a diverse group of kids.

25:25.549 --> 25:27.627
Well, as diverse as you can get

25:27.629 --> 25:29.887
for a Canadian-based
program set in the '90's.

25:29.889 --> 25:32.807
But these kids had
their own little clique,

25:32.809 --> 25:35.447
the Midnight Society,
and they'd sit around

25:35.449 --> 25:37.217
and tell campfire tales.

25:37.219 --> 25:39.177
What kid can't relate to telling

25:39.179 --> 25:41.097
ghost stories with their friends?

25:41.099 --> 25:43.863
The concept alone stole my heart.

25:43.865 --> 25:47.777
But Goosebumps was just so goddamn fun.

25:47.779 --> 25:48.637
See, there it is.

25:48.639 --> 25:49.497
Fun.

25:49.499 --> 25:52.672
I will agree that Goosebumps
was funner, or more fun.

25:53.909 --> 25:55.847
Why isn't funner a real word?

25:55.849 --> 25:57.847
It sounds like a real word.

25:57.849 --> 25:58.847
I think it sounds like a real world.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.009
Picasso, please focus.

26:01.011 --> 26:02.547
Goosebumps was fun,

26:02.549 --> 26:06.067
but Are You Afraid of the Dark? was scary.

26:06.069 --> 26:09.597
That's why it'll always
fart on Goosebumps.

26:09.599 --> 26:11.917
The Goosebumps episodes,
for the most part,

26:11.919 --> 26:13.487
were watered down.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.547
You can tell they were made for kids.

26:15.549 --> 26:19.827
But are You Afraid of
the Dark? had zero chill.

26:19.829 --> 26:22.757
The villains were scary,
the storylines were dark,

26:22.759 --> 26:26.007
and they had no problem
ending a tale on a down note.

26:26.009 --> 26:27.837
They went there.

26:27.839 --> 26:32.297
I always appreciate kid content
that doesn't censor itself.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.987
Because kids are basically
pint-sized adults, right?

26:34.989 --> 26:36.602
We can handle the bleak shit.

26:38.439 --> 26:41.167
I'm just saying, if I had the choice

26:41.169 --> 26:45.077
to binge-watch Goosebumps or
Are You Afraid of the Dark?

26:45.079 --> 26:47.787
I'm always gonna go with Goosebumps.

26:47.789 --> 26:50.657
Even if my preference is solely based

26:50.659 --> 26:53.887
on the fond memories I have
of buying as many Goosebumps

26:53.889 --> 26:55.867
stories as I could at the school book fair

26:55.869 --> 26:58.597
or watching the show on Saturday mornings.

26:58.599 --> 27:01.167
The happiness that Goosebumps brought me

27:01.169 --> 27:04.332
ranks it leaps and bounds above
Are You Afraid of the Dark?

27:09.661 --> 27:11.037
I know what I wanted to ask you?

27:11.039 --> 27:12.557
How much is rent here?

27:12.559 --> 27:13.667
Like $200 something.

27:13.669 --> 27:14.687
Fall off a cliff.

27:14.689 --> 27:16.547
You pay $200 something to live here?

27:16.549 --> 27:18.637
Well, I own it, that's why.

27:18.639 --> 27:20.277
You're a homeowner?

27:20.279 --> 27:21.157
Yeah.

27:21.159 --> 27:22.242
You own a home.

27:23.259 --> 27:25.797
That is what homeowner means.

27:25.799 --> 27:27.867
Are you like low-key
millionaire or something?

27:27.869 --> 27:29.107
No.

27:29.109 --> 27:31.937
My grandfather built cars for Ford.

27:31.939 --> 27:35.127
He worked there for almost 30 years.

27:35.129 --> 27:36.847
He made some very nice money,

27:36.849 --> 27:39.607
and when he passed he
left me a little dough.

27:39.609 --> 27:42.947
A little dough to buy a fuckin' condo.

27:42.949 --> 27:44.887
How much did this place cost?

27:44.889 --> 27:46.587
No, you don't have to answer that.

27:46.589 --> 27:47.427
Wait, yes you do.

27:47.429 --> 27:48.260
How much?

27:48.262 --> 27:50.127
It was not cheap.

27:50.129 --> 27:51.332
That's what I will say.

27:52.479 --> 27:54.807
So what kind of car
do you drive, a Beemer?

27:54.809 --> 27:56.741
No, a Prius.

27:56.743 --> 27:57.801
A Prius?

27:57.803 --> 27:59.020
What's wrong with Priuses?

27:59.022 --> 28:01.089
Do you know how much gas
you save with a Prius?

28:01.091 --> 28:04.747
Priuses are such
anticlimactic cars, you know?

28:04.749 --> 28:07.657
They're also fugly and
they're in abundance.

28:07.659 --> 28:10.587
I see, like, 40 Priuses a day
and they always make me upset.

28:10.589 --> 28:12.137
Why?

28:12.139 --> 28:13.687
Prius drivers are so smug.

28:13.689 --> 28:16.007
Like, ooh, look at me, I drive the most

28:16.009 --> 28:18.707
fuel efficient gasoline-powered
car in the country.

28:18.709 --> 28:20.877
And that's not a good thing?

28:20.879 --> 28:21.957
No, it is.

28:21.959 --> 28:23.502
Then why so hostile?

28:24.569 --> 28:27.587
I don't know, I'll
get back to you on that.

28:27.589 --> 28:30.737
Also, why are you driving a Toyota car

28:30.739 --> 28:33.497
when your grandfather put
his blood, sweat, and tears

28:33.499 --> 28:36.257
into proudly serving
the Ford Motor Company?

28:36.259 --> 28:39.177
You can probably get
discounts on Ford products.

28:39.179 --> 28:40.387
Not at all.

28:40.389 --> 28:42.387
Well, you're still lucky.

28:42.389 --> 28:43.777
Not that your grandpa died.

28:43.779 --> 28:44.927
I'm sorry about that.

28:44.929 --> 28:47.307
But leaving you the inheritance?

28:47.309 --> 28:50.567
I wish my grandpa would die
and leave me some money.

28:50.569 --> 28:52.807
Actually, I don't need the money,

28:52.809 --> 28:54.927
I just wish my grandpa would die.

28:54.929 --> 28:56.287
I don't like my grandpa.

28:56.289 --> 28:58.067
He can't say anything without yelling,

28:58.069 --> 29:00.047
he always spits when he talks,

29:00.049 --> 29:03.427
he can't say thank you,
and he always smells

29:03.429 --> 29:05.667
like olives when he
doesn't even eat olives.

29:05.669 --> 29:07.467
Isn't it interesting how in our old age

29:07.469 --> 29:09.197
we revert back to infancy.

29:09.199 --> 29:13.117
We shit on ourselves freely,
we drool when we're excited,

29:13.119 --> 29:16.497
soft foods are marvelous, and we can say

29:16.499 --> 29:19.357
whatever we want without any backlash.

29:19.359 --> 29:22.407
I remember I was at the
mall with my grandpa,

29:22.409 --> 29:25.787
and this really obese lady walked by,

29:25.789 --> 29:29.012
and my grandfather said, very loudly,

29:30.029 --> 29:32.262
she got the nodamnneck syndrome.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.397
Grandpa, what is nodamnneck?

29:36.399 --> 29:40.612
He said, no damn neck.

29:41.637 --> 29:42.957
And the lady heard him.

29:42.959 --> 29:47.872
She turned around, looked at
him, and then walked away.

29:48.876 --> 29:50.077
You know if I had said that...

29:50.079 --> 29:52.097
She would've beaten
the ambition out of you.

29:52.099 --> 29:53.587
Exactly.

29:53.589 --> 29:55.447
And that wasn't the first or last time

29:55.449 --> 29:57.677
my grandfather said
something crazy like that.

29:57.679 --> 30:02.679
Now, my mom isn't the
best cook, but she tries.

30:02.869 --> 30:05.007
Every Sunday she would make us breakfast.

30:05.009 --> 30:08.397
Pancakes, eggs, fruit, you name it.

30:08.399 --> 30:10.937
Now her eggs weren't so bad,

30:10.939 --> 30:14.197
but her pancakes were a calamity.

30:14.199 --> 30:18.067
Now, my father and I, we'd
never say anything about it,

30:18.069 --> 30:20.397
we'd just eat the pancakes and pretend

30:20.399 --> 30:22.942
they were the best
flapjacks that we ever had.

30:23.879 --> 30:27.287
My grandfather came over one Sunday,

30:27.289 --> 30:29.207
and he ate the food, no problem.

30:29.209 --> 30:31.657
But after breakfast, my mom asked him how

30:31.659 --> 30:35.577
he liked the pancakes, and
he said he would like them

30:35.579 --> 30:38.717
better if they didn't taste like hot shit.

30:38.719 --> 30:39.601
Goddamn, Gertrude.

30:39.603 --> 30:41.967
My mom didn't even get offended.

30:41.969 --> 30:46.537
She just looked at him,
laughed, and walked away.

30:46.539 --> 30:47.937
I look forward to that.

30:47.939 --> 30:49.057
Just being the old dude

30:49.059 --> 30:50.736
that doesn't know how to censor himself.

30:50.738 --> 30:52.527
You and me both.

30:52.529 --> 30:55.253
I'm gonna mow kids down in
my electric shopping cart.

30:55.255 --> 30:57.505
(LAUGHING)

30:58.829 --> 31:00.917
The thought of our
generation being grandparents,

31:00.919 --> 31:02.687
though, is a little scary.

31:02.689 --> 31:05.567
We don't have the same
sensibilities our grandparents had.

31:05.569 --> 31:08.867
Sock hops, having to wait a whole week

31:08.869 --> 31:11.577
just to see a new episode of a TV show

31:11.579 --> 31:12.857
Using landlines.

31:12.859 --> 31:14.318
Respecting our elders.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.867
Actually working to get what you want.

31:16.869 --> 31:19.157
Actually having talent to find success

31:19.159 --> 31:20.724
in the film or music industry.

31:20.726 --> 31:23.617
Having to meet your boyfriend
or girlfriend's parents

31:23.619 --> 31:25.550
before you could actually
call yourselves a couple.

31:25.552 --> 31:26.383
Yeah.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.787
I think the biggest downfall
are the pop culture figures.

31:29.789 --> 31:33.027
Our parents and grandparents
grew up with legit legends.

31:33.029 --> 31:36.187
Who are we supposed to brag
about to our kids or grandkids?

31:36.189 --> 31:39.387
Fetty Wap, Lil' Yatchy,
Beiber the Boy Wonder?

31:39.389 --> 31:44.077
We have J. Cole, Bryson
Tiller, and your girl, Beyoncé.

31:44.079 --> 31:47.207
We have a few icons among
us, but you're right.

31:47.209 --> 31:50.197
It's nowhere near as
special as it used to be.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.682
This is making me sad now.

31:52.799 --> 31:55.157
Wait, random realization.

31:55.159 --> 31:56.857
You grilled me about my name,

31:56.859 --> 32:00.327
but I've never met anybody named Sisanie.

32:00.329 --> 32:02.447
Your name's pretty out there too.

32:02.449 --> 32:05.257
Well, it's a pretty uninspired story.

32:05.259 --> 32:06.907
I was conceived in Sisani.

32:06.909 --> 32:08.498
That's pretty much it.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.927
Where's Sisani?

32:09.929 --> 32:10.760
It's in Greece.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.877
My parents were vacationing there,

32:12.879 --> 32:15.837
things got a little frisky,
and then 9 months later

32:15.839 --> 32:18.247
I was plunged into consciousness.

32:18.249 --> 32:19.197
The only difference is my name

32:19.199 --> 32:20.707
is spelled with an E at the end.

32:20.709 --> 32:22.317
Isn't that unpleasant that your name

32:22.319 --> 32:24.594
brings to mind your parents having sex.

32:24.596 --> 32:25.427
No.

32:25.429 --> 32:27.037
If my parents named me after the place

32:27.039 --> 32:29.397
where they got it on in,
I could never hear my name

32:29.399 --> 32:34.267
without thinking of my parents
doing unspeakable things.

32:34.269 --> 32:37.242
You may have some things
you need to work out then.

32:39.459 --> 32:41.022
You are such a guy.

32:42.319 --> 32:44.017
I feel like I should
be offended by that.

32:44.019 --> 32:45.267
No, it's not a bad thing,

32:45.269 --> 32:48.457
it's just your apartment
is a guy's apartment.

32:48.459 --> 32:51.489
Minimal furniture, a TV
larger than necessary,

32:51.491 --> 32:54.627
and I'm getting a vision
that in one of your cabinets

32:54.629 --> 32:56.987
you have a family size bag of chips in it.

32:56.989 --> 32:59.817
Sour Cream and Onion.

32:59.819 --> 33:01.666
How do you do it?

33:01.668 --> 33:03.227
I's good.

33:03.229 --> 33:05.129
So what do you do for fun around here?

33:12.009 --> 33:12.842
Ha.

33:16.038 --> 33:17.527
You lucky little shit.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.857
Is it luck to win 7 times in a row?

33:19.859 --> 33:21.077
This is skill, chica.

33:21.079 --> 33:22.507
No, reset that shit.

33:22.509 --> 33:24.472
Why are you doing this to yourself?

33:25.479 --> 33:26.312
Hmm?

33:31.789 --> 33:36.067
Three, two, one, Ray Allen with the shot!

33:36.069 --> 33:36.902
Booyah!

33:38.029 --> 33:39.590
Where's the sportsmanship?

33:39.592 --> 33:41.612
It's up my ass and down the street.

33:43.249 --> 33:45.531
You don't have to do
that, I'll pick it up.

33:45.533 --> 33:47.088
Can you get me another ale, though?

33:47.090 --> 33:49.222
I sure can, loser.

33:51.449 --> 33:53.102
Oh, goodness, everywhere.

34:11.239 --> 34:12.717
Look what I found.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.877
This is actually impressive.

34:14.879 --> 34:17.027
You could easily get your
rocks off via the internet,

34:17.029 --> 34:19.587
but you are taking it
back to the old school

34:19.589 --> 34:21.757
with the hard copy porn.

34:21.759 --> 34:23.292
That deserves a slow clap.

34:23.293 --> 34:25.312
(HANDS CLAPPING)

34:25.313 --> 34:27.567
I actually forgot I had that.

34:27.569 --> 34:29.447
So you're taking ownership then?

34:29.449 --> 34:31.429
No cockamamie excuses?

34:31.431 --> 34:32.766
What could I say?

34:32.768 --> 34:34.496
Your friend, Hut, left it.

34:34.498 --> 34:35.667
Nope, it's all me.

34:35.668 --> 34:38.484
Hmm, you got a lot of these?

34:38.485 --> 34:41.226
Not a lot, but there are others.

34:41.228 --> 34:42.842
More honesty, good for you.

34:43.909 --> 34:45.746
One thing I will say is I don't always

34:45.748 --> 34:48.087
look through that for gratification.

34:48.089 --> 34:49.837
I also do it because I find something

34:49.839 --> 34:51.266
feministic about porn stars.

34:51.268 --> 34:53.367
You were doing so well.

34:53.369 --> 34:55.217
Now you're flinging shit in my face.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.947
I mean, doing porn isn't
a glamorous line of work

34:58.949 --> 35:00.747
despite the way it's advertised,

35:00.749 --> 35:03.427
but I still find something feministic

35:03.429 --> 35:05.627
about women in the porn industry.

35:05.629 --> 35:08.637
Yeah, cum on my face Mr. Postman.

35:08.639 --> 35:10.707
What freedom fighters they are.

35:10.709 --> 35:14.997
Well, on a cursory level
it seems very demeaning,

35:14.999 --> 35:17.557
but these women are loaded.

35:17.559 --> 35:19.607
Loaded with semen.

35:19.609 --> 35:23.597
No, well yeah, but they're
also loaded with cash.

35:23.599 --> 35:25.182
They get paid to screw.

35:26.259 --> 35:28.517
So if you had a
daughter and she ended up

35:28.519 --> 35:30.962
being a porn star, you'd support her?

35:31.959 --> 35:34.767
I wouldn't want that,
but if she's of age,

35:34.769 --> 35:36.227
she can make a living however she'd like

35:36.229 --> 35:37.397
as long as it's legal.

35:37.399 --> 35:38.497
You don't mean that.

35:38.499 --> 35:41.987
Look, women are sexualized
everyday against their will.

35:41.989 --> 35:45.087
Porn stars are totally
and completely in control

35:45.089 --> 35:47.487
of what goes in or out of their bodies.

35:47.489 --> 35:50.057
They're not doing anything
that they don't wanna do.

35:50.059 --> 35:52.227
Yeah, but what about those videos

35:52.229 --> 35:53.957
where the dudes take it too far?

35:53.959 --> 35:56.187
They go way past their
co-stars comfort level

35:56.189 --> 35:57.807
without having an ounce of compassion.

35:57.809 --> 36:00.057
Those guys are dick-shits,
but for the most part,

36:00.059 --> 36:02.867
the porn industry has
stipulations that are respected.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.867
I'm not saying that women
should set their sights

36:04.869 --> 36:06.867
on doing porn, of course not.

36:06.869 --> 36:09.937
I am saying those women
that, for whatever reason,

36:09.939 --> 36:11.867
find themselves in that world,

36:11.869 --> 36:14.167
the ones with tough
skin, the ones who know

36:14.169 --> 36:17.037
that they're more than just
fat-tittied bimbo number 2,

36:17.039 --> 36:19.517
they deserve recognition
for paying the bills

36:19.519 --> 36:21.607
with the assets that
they've been blessed with.

36:21.609 --> 36:24.117
The assets they were blessed with?

36:24.119 --> 36:28.497
Um, like, 98% of porn
stars have fake asses,

36:28.499 --> 36:32.037
fake boobs, fake hair,
fake lips, fake eyes.

36:32.039 --> 36:34.587
Well, they're blessed with
the money to adorn themselves.

36:34.589 --> 36:36.757
Yeah, but why are they doing that?

36:36.759 --> 36:38.867
They're doing that to
follow some beauty chart

36:38.869 --> 36:41.597
that was created by some fuckin' vermin

36:41.599 --> 36:42.787
who thinks he has the authority

36:42.789 --> 36:44.417
to decide what makes a woman attractive.

36:44.419 --> 36:46.057
Yeah, but they're doing what they have

36:46.059 --> 36:47.457
to do to stay in the game.

36:47.459 --> 36:50.437
Yeah, but in the end, it's
the men who call the shots.

36:50.439 --> 36:51.877
Hardly feministic.

36:51.879 --> 36:55.467
But the face of porn,
the ones that are keeping

36:55.469 --> 36:58.677
this industry as popular
as it is, are the women.

36:58.679 --> 37:00.437
Yeah, but look at the side effects.

37:00.439 --> 37:02.677
You got those guys out there
that only know how to relate

37:02.679 --> 37:05.907
to women by what they see
on their computer screens.

37:05.909 --> 37:07.677
Did you forget what happened to me?

37:07.679 --> 37:08.947
You're totally right.

37:08.949 --> 37:11.657
I'm just saying that porn stars
are just doing their jobs.

37:11.659 --> 37:13.647
You can't blame them for
the dummies out there

37:13.649 --> 37:16.657
that don't know the difference
between reality and fantasy.

37:16.659 --> 37:19.157
That's like watching Man of Steel

37:19.159 --> 37:23.287
and saying, oh, Superman
can fly, so can I!

37:23.289 --> 37:24.567
People have tried.

37:24.569 --> 37:25.507
And they're dummies.

37:25.509 --> 37:26.707
Like I said.

37:26.709 --> 37:28.907
But also porn can be a
means to better oneself.

37:28.909 --> 37:31.497
Like, look at that girl who
did porn to pay her tuition.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.887
She used what she had
to get what she needed,

37:33.889 --> 37:35.457
and that's awesome.

37:35.459 --> 37:38.247
I know a guy that has sex
with grannies to keep himself

37:38.249 --> 37:41.167
financially satiated
and he's hailed for it.

37:41.169 --> 37:43.787
Female porn stars deserve praise too.

37:43.789 --> 37:48.147
You have a friend that has
sex with old ladies for money?

37:48.149 --> 37:49.827
That is revolting.

37:49.829 --> 37:51.407
You gotta eat.

37:51.409 --> 37:52.527
No pun intended.

37:52.529 --> 37:54.707
That pun was so intended.

37:54.709 --> 37:55.662
How old's this guy?

37:56.579 --> 37:57.597
24.

37:57.599 --> 37:59.377
Of course he is.

37:59.379 --> 38:02.277
Yet another Generation Y distinction.

38:02.279 --> 38:04.847
Only a '90s baby would
mitigate his probity

38:04.849 --> 38:06.617
by investing in his dick.

38:06.619 --> 38:09.077
You act like prostitution and being

38:09.079 --> 38:11.757
a sugar baby are new professions.

38:11.759 --> 38:13.727
They've been around for centuries.

38:13.729 --> 38:14.597
I know that.

38:14.599 --> 38:16.837
But back then, people
had to sell their bodies

38:16.839 --> 38:19.827
because they had no other way
to provide for themselves.

38:19.829 --> 38:22.286
They also weren't proud
of what they were doing.

38:22.288 --> 38:25.571
Does this guy enjoy
having sex with grannies?

38:25.573 --> 38:26.427
Oh yeah.

38:26.429 --> 38:27.287
Ew.

38:27.289 --> 38:29.687
Sex is for pleasure not profit.

38:29.689 --> 38:31.894
I've always thought
any work that was legal

38:31.896 --> 38:34.897
was good work, and porn is legal.

38:34.899 --> 38:36.417
Prostitution isn't legal.

38:36.419 --> 38:37.507
It is in Nevada.

38:37.509 --> 38:39.217
Being a sugar baby isn't legal either.

38:39.219 --> 38:40.706
It actually is.

38:40.708 --> 38:42.147
The guy I told you about,

38:42.149 --> 38:43.827
he actually explained how it works.

38:43.829 --> 38:45.977
He hangs out with the
grannies, but there's never

38:45.979 --> 38:48.567
an explicit deal to
exchange money for sex.

38:48.569 --> 38:52.237
This guy, he's pretty vulgar.

38:52.239 --> 38:55.487
He talks about sex a lot,
but it's more than that.

38:55.489 --> 38:57.057
His sugar mamas take care of him,

38:57.059 --> 38:59.707
and in he provides them
with companionship.

38:59.709 --> 39:01.257
Sex is just a bonus.

39:01.259 --> 39:03.217
It doesn't matter
which way you frame it,

39:03.219 --> 39:07.612
prostitution, sugar babying,
porn, none of that's reputable.

39:08.459 --> 39:09.617
What is reputable?

39:09.619 --> 39:12.937
A job that requires you
to keep your clothes on.

39:12.939 --> 39:14.087
You're in finance, right?

39:14.089 --> 39:15.042
Yeah.

39:16.029 --> 39:17.147
That's a real job.

39:17.149 --> 39:19.617
But it's not a job that I enjoy.

39:19.619 --> 39:21.020
Then why do you do it?

39:21.022 --> 39:22.767
Because it pays well.

39:22.769 --> 39:25.037
Look, for a person like my grandpa,

39:25.039 --> 39:26.877
he worked to take care of his family.

39:26.879 --> 39:28.677
I don't even know if he
liked working for Ford,

39:28.679 --> 39:29.937
but he did it.

39:29.939 --> 39:31.587
That's the old school mentality.

39:31.589 --> 39:34.647
Work to provide, not work to enjoy.

39:34.649 --> 39:36.617
That's something our generation
does get right, though.

39:36.619 --> 39:39.142
We don't do shit unless it makes us happy.

39:40.419 --> 39:41.869
I missed the memo apparently.

39:42.739 --> 39:45.562
So how did you get into
finance if you don't like it?

39:48.129 --> 39:48.960
You're probably going to think

39:48.962 --> 39:50.117
I'm flinging more shit in your face,

39:50.119 --> 39:53.337
but senior year of high
school I saw everyone

39:53.339 --> 39:55.582
around me latch on to a field of study.

39:57.019 --> 39:58.797
I saw everyone find something

39:58.799 --> 40:00.722
that they really connected with.

40:01.699 --> 40:02.877
I didn't know what I wanted to do,

40:02.879 --> 40:05.107
and I didn't want anyone to know

40:05.109 --> 40:06.427
that I didn't know what I wanted to do.

40:06.429 --> 40:10.027
So, literally, I looked up the top 10

40:10.029 --> 40:12.987
most popular professions,
I wrote them all down

40:12.989 --> 40:16.382
on separate pieces of
paper, I put them in a hat,

40:17.319 --> 40:21.487
and I picked one and it said accounting.

40:21.489 --> 40:24.647
So you spent four years studying

40:24.649 --> 40:26.387
something you have no interest in?

40:26.389 --> 40:27.447
Yeah.

40:27.449 --> 40:29.357
I thought by the time I turned 18

40:29.359 --> 40:30.190
I should've found my calling,

40:30.192 --> 40:32.427
and when I hadn't, I was worried.

40:32.429 --> 40:34.397
Even now, I don't really know where I'd be

40:34.399 --> 40:36.549
if I hadn't done that
college major raffle.

40:38.609 --> 40:41.147
I live my days as a chameleon.

40:41.149 --> 40:44.927
I go to work because that's
what people my age do.

40:44.929 --> 40:48.722
I drink coffee because
that's what people my age do.

40:49.849 --> 40:51.137
The only time I don't feel out of place

40:51.139 --> 40:53.632
is when I'm just on my futon watching TV.

40:55.049 --> 40:56.827
That's why I salute porn
stars and the people

40:56.829 --> 40:58.367
that you may call degenerates,

40:58.369 --> 41:02.207
because at least they're
doing what they enjoy.

41:02.209 --> 41:06.447
And speaking of doing things
you enjoy, you're a dramaturg.

41:06.449 --> 41:09.157
I'd never even heard of that before you.

41:09.159 --> 41:11.707
But it's something that you're keen on.

41:11.709 --> 41:14.577
You contextualize the world of a play.

41:14.579 --> 41:16.457
You're the bridge that connects

41:16.459 --> 41:20.740
the text, the actors, and the audience.

41:20.742 --> 41:22.367
Do you know what any
of that means or are

41:22.369 --> 41:24.803
you just snowballing the
shit that I told you before?

41:24.805 --> 41:28.192
Ah, a little bit of both,
but I'm mostly snowballing.

41:29.319 --> 41:32.442
We're theatrical gurus, basically.

41:33.279 --> 41:36.277
We're critical thinkers
to the highest degree.

41:36.279 --> 41:39.247
We take the literary info, cultural info,

41:39.249 --> 41:42.657
artistic info, and symbolic info,

41:42.659 --> 41:45.427
though that's pretty much
in line with artistic info,

41:45.429 --> 41:48.097
and we provide all of that to our team,

41:48.099 --> 41:49.887
before and during the show.

41:49.889 --> 41:51.728
And then sometimes after depending on

41:51.730 --> 41:54.427
how much of a mindfuck the play was.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.267
And you're working on an
ecological piece now, right?

41:56.269 --> 41:57.647
The Shakespeare one?

41:57.649 --> 41:59.917
Yeah, we're doing an
interactive adaptation

41:59.919 --> 42:01.977
of A Midsummer Night's Dream.

42:01.979 --> 42:04.597
There's no actual set, it
takes place place all outside.

42:04.599 --> 42:06.837
We're really playing with nature's role

42:06.839 --> 42:09.477
in this world that Shakespeare created.

42:09.479 --> 42:12.127
Whether he knew it or not, he really gave

42:12.129 --> 42:14.887
a voice to nature in
the form of the fairies.

42:14.889 --> 42:16.271
The forest is their home.

42:16.273 --> 42:18.067
The forest is what they know.

42:18.069 --> 42:20.837
The fairies, the creatures
that embody nature,

42:20.839 --> 42:23.517
they're the strongest
characters in the entire play.

42:23.519 --> 42:27.347
And the fact that they're
proficient in enchantment

42:27.349 --> 42:30.547
conveys just how dominant nature is.

42:30.549 --> 42:33.297
So we're really trying
bringing all that out.

42:33.299 --> 42:34.521
I'd really like to see that.

42:34.523 --> 42:35.773
I can get you a ticket.

42:37.549 --> 42:40.097
But here's my thing
about ecological theater.

42:40.099 --> 42:42.857
I saw this play once, I don't
remember what it was called,

42:42.859 --> 42:44.687
but it was about these two polar bears

42:44.689 --> 42:47.537
that were struggling to survive
in the changing climate.

42:47.539 --> 42:49.767
One thing that I could not get over was

42:49.769 --> 42:52.037
why these polar bears spoke like people,

42:52.039 --> 42:53.007
and not just any people,

42:53.009 --> 42:55.537
they spoke like characters
in a Mamet play.

42:55.539 --> 42:57.427
Like F-words and all.

42:57.429 --> 42:59.225
I think I know what
play you're talking about.

42:59.227 --> 43:00.567
Ben and Bart.

43:00.569 --> 43:02.567
Sure, but if you really wanna make

43:02.569 --> 43:04.077
an ecological theater piece,

43:04.079 --> 43:06.057
wouldn't it be best to show animals

43:06.059 --> 43:08.267
and nature as they really are?

43:08.269 --> 43:10.687
I mean, I understand what
you and your team are doing.

43:10.689 --> 43:12.227
But that's different
because you're working

43:12.229 --> 43:13.867
with material that already exists.

43:13.869 --> 43:18.897
But this Ben and Bart stuff,
polar bears don't talk.

43:18.899 --> 43:21.157
This little buddy comedy approach,

43:21.159 --> 43:23.687
it diminished how serious
climate change is,

43:23.689 --> 43:27.567
and it humanized a very
non-human narrative.

43:27.569 --> 43:29.457
It would've been much more compelling

43:29.459 --> 43:32.797
to let actors that actually
looked like bears move around

43:32.799 --> 43:36.177
the space and react to what's
going on without talking.

43:36.179 --> 43:37.010
I'd be all for that.

43:37.012 --> 43:40.417
But most audiences won't pay
to see something like that.

43:40.419 --> 43:43.907
That's why you see talking
trees or talking polar bears.

43:43.909 --> 43:46.123
We try to wrap an ecological message

43:46.125 --> 43:48.737
into the play without
the audience knowing.

43:48.739 --> 43:51.197
Then don't advertise
them as ecological plays.

43:51.199 --> 43:52.772
Just call them plays.

43:54.019 --> 43:54.969
You got any food?

43:56.262 --> 43:58.107
I think some chips would make you happy.

43:58.109 --> 43:59.259
I think you're right.

44:00.709 --> 44:02.467
Okay, here's one.

44:02.469 --> 44:03.952
Kill, fuck, marry.

44:05.259 --> 44:09.349
Meg, Princess Jasmine, and Princess Tiana.

44:09.351 --> 44:11.257
That is quite the roster.

44:11.259 --> 44:13.787
I would fuck Princess Jasmine,

44:13.789 --> 44:16.497
because you know Aladdin's
not giving it to her right.

44:16.499 --> 44:18.117
I would marry Princess Tiana,

44:18.119 --> 44:21.397
because I really think she'd
make me feel invincible.

44:21.399 --> 44:22.230
Sorry Meg.

44:22.232 --> 44:24.197
Of course you'd kill the most

44:24.199 --> 44:26.967
underrated Disney princess in the world.

44:26.969 --> 44:28.767
What other Princess gives you cynicism,

44:28.769 --> 44:29.957
beauty, and backbone.

44:29.959 --> 44:31.587
I still gotta kill her.

44:31.589 --> 44:33.090
You're such an ass-dragon.

44:33.092 --> 44:34.957
Okay, this is getting serious.

44:34.959 --> 44:39.959
Hmm, Prince Charming, Li Shang,
and the Beast in human form.

44:41.219 --> 44:42.707
Um, geez.

44:42.709 --> 44:44.507
Okay, kill Prince Charming.

44:44.509 --> 44:46.387
He's too much of a square for me.

44:46.389 --> 44:49.377
Marry Li Shang, because I think
he'd make a man out of me.

44:49.379 --> 44:53.387
And fuck the Beast, cause he's a beast.

44:53.389 --> 44:55.997
Ah, that's a noble selection.

44:55.999 --> 44:56.830
Oh yes.

44:56.832 --> 45:00.737
Ursula, Cruella De Vil, and Lady Tremaine.

45:00.739 --> 45:02.777
Ooh, I'd kill Cruella immediately.

45:02.779 --> 45:04.117
She's too skinny for me.

45:04.119 --> 45:06.687
I would marry Lady Tremaine.

45:06.689 --> 45:08.347
And I would fuck Ursula.

45:08.349 --> 45:10.465
I'm swimming all up in that octopussy,

45:10.467 --> 45:11.298
just (IMITATING SWIMMING).

45:11.300 --> 45:12.952
Oh my God, you really just said that.

45:13.882 --> 45:14.713
Ew.

45:14.715 --> 45:17.277
Okay, I get very involved
when I play these games, okay?

45:17.279 --> 45:18.337
Alright.

45:18.339 --> 45:21.962
Jafar, Hades, and Gaston.

45:23.149 --> 45:26.837
Now you'd think I'd fuck the
muscle-bound Gaston, right?

45:26.839 --> 45:27.670
Hell no.

45:27.672 --> 45:30.757
He'd rather fuck himself,
so I'm gonna kill him.

45:30.759 --> 45:33.877
Marry Hades, because he's
the ruler of the underworld.

45:33.879 --> 45:36.437
Can someone say sovereignty?

45:36.439 --> 45:38.577
And I'd fuck Jafar, because underneath

45:38.579 --> 45:41.549
that rough exterior I think
he'd be a generous lover.

45:41.551 --> 45:44.087
Now that deserves a slow clap.

45:44.089 --> 45:46.510
Wait, I have to do it with you.

45:46.512 --> 45:49.262
(HANDS CLAPPING)

45:55.129 --> 45:56.137
You sure you wanna do this?

45:56.139 --> 45:58.697
Did you not hear me when
I said I'm The Riddler?

45:58.699 --> 46:00.067
Okay, last chance to tap out.

46:00.069 --> 46:02.535
I don't need to tap
out, I'm The Riddler.

46:02.537 --> 46:03.368
Are you really?

46:03.370 --> 46:04.287
Yes.

46:04.289 --> 46:06.707
As an only child, you
have a lot of down time.

46:06.709 --> 46:09.057
I read riddle books all day.

46:09.059 --> 46:11.037
That's not something I'd brag about.

46:11.039 --> 46:11.870
Whatever.

46:11.872 --> 46:14.417
I'm ready like Spongebob, alright?

46:14.419 --> 46:16.417
Okay, you know what
happens if you get one wrong.

46:16.419 --> 46:17.420
I do know, but that's not something

46:17.422 --> 46:21.887
that I need to worry about,
because I'm gonna ace this shit.

46:21.889 --> 46:24.157
Okay, coming at you.

46:24.159 --> 46:25.777
Five of the hardest riddles.

46:25.779 --> 46:27.331
Five of the easiest riddles.

46:27.333 --> 46:28.164
Mhm.

46:28.166 --> 46:30.587
Number one, it's more powerful than God.

46:30.589 --> 46:32.157
It's more evil than the devil.

46:32.159 --> 46:33.097
The poor have it.

46:33.099 --> 46:34.017
The rich need it.

46:34.019 --> 46:35.007
If you eat it, you'll die.

46:35.009 --> 46:35.840
What is it?

46:35.842 --> 46:36.827
Nothing.

46:36.829 --> 46:38.507
I have two arms, but fingers none.

46:38.509 --> 46:40.197
I have two feet, but cannot run.

46:40.199 --> 46:42.297
I carry well, but I've found I carry best

46:42.299 --> 46:43.407
with my feet off the ground.

46:43.409 --> 46:44.240
What am I?

46:44.242 --> 46:46.167
Yawn, wheel barrel.

46:46.169 --> 46:48.937
The more you take, the more
you leave behind, what am I?

46:48.939 --> 46:49.770
Fingerprints.

46:49.772 --> 46:51.447
You can't handle me.

46:51.449 --> 46:53.467
What disappears as
soon as you say its name?

46:53.469 --> 46:54.677
Silence.

46:54.679 --> 46:55.752
Last one, come on.

46:56.589 --> 46:59.047
What type of dress can not be worn?

46:59.049 --> 47:00.857
That was your last one, really?

47:00.859 --> 47:01.997
You could've done better.

47:01.999 --> 47:03.727
Much, much better.

47:03.729 --> 47:06.102
An address.

47:08.859 --> 47:11.267
Hey, now I have a bonus one for you.

47:11.269 --> 47:12.487
That wasn't part of the deal.

47:12.489 --> 47:14.097
I thought you were The Riddler.

47:14.099 --> 47:14.977
Fine.

47:14.979 --> 47:16.247
Riddle my boots.

47:16.249 --> 47:17.080
Okay.

47:17.082 --> 47:18.907
I went to a football game, right?

47:18.909 --> 47:22.077
The quarterback threw a
pass to the wide receiver.

47:22.079 --> 47:24.217
The wide receiver caught
it in the end zone,

47:24.219 --> 47:26.037
but no guys scored a touchdown.

47:26.039 --> 47:27.106
How can that be?

47:27.108 --> 47:27.939
What?

47:27.941 --> 47:29.497
This has to be a trick question.

47:29.499 --> 47:31.549
Was there a penalty or something?

47:31.551 --> 47:33.407
No, it was very a clean touchdown.

47:33.409 --> 47:35.047
There just weren't any guys on the field.

47:35.049 --> 47:35.880
That can't be.

47:35.882 --> 47:37.167
You can't score a touchdown

47:37.169 --> 47:38.857
without any guys on the field.

47:38.859 --> 47:39.767
I'm telling you.

47:39.769 --> 47:41.397
No guys were playing.

47:41.399 --> 47:43.184
Was it an imaginary game or something?

47:43.186 --> 47:45.282
No, it was very real game.

47:46.569 --> 47:48.219
You've gotta be pulling my leg.

47:49.319 --> 47:51.792
You can't score a
touchdown without any guys.

47:52.649 --> 47:53.597
What are you talking about?

47:53.599 --> 47:55.552
It was an all girl's football game.

47:56.398 --> 47:58.532
Goddamn, Gertrude.

48:00.489 --> 48:03.302
Gonna do some relish.

48:03.304 --> 48:04.137
Mmm.

48:05.368 --> 48:07.912
I think we'll top it off
with some chocolate sauce.

48:09.589 --> 48:10.482
Oh yeah.

48:12.019 --> 48:13.652
Stir that bad boy up.

48:15.999 --> 48:19.302
One Disaster On the Rocks for
the overconfident young bloke.

48:20.849 --> 48:21.680
Can I tap out now?

48:21.682 --> 48:23.217
I thought you didn't need to tap out.

48:23.219 --> 48:24.669
You're The Riddler, remember?

48:26.029 --> 48:26.862
Drink up.

48:27.729 --> 48:30.363

Nice barf fest?

49:38.059 --> 49:39.237
Oh yeah.

49:39.239 --> 49:41.107
Yeah, I know all about that.

49:41.109 --> 49:44.557
At my old apartment I
accidentally ate a roach.

49:44.559 --> 49:46.697
How do you accidentally eat a roach?

49:46.699 --> 49:48.717
I was making some food in the kitchen.

49:48.719 --> 49:50.717
I turned my back for like two seconds,

49:50.719 --> 49:53.527
and the little dirtbag made
a break for my sandwich.

49:53.529 --> 49:55.347
Of course, I didn't
notice so I put the other

49:55.349 --> 49:57.517
piece of bread on top of the roach,

49:57.519 --> 49:59.857
and didn't realize I
was sharing my sandwich

49:59.859 --> 50:01.037
until it was too late.

50:01.039 --> 50:03.567

transplant after that.

50:03.569 --> 50:04.400
Oh yeah.

50:04.402 --> 50:06.927
I was in the bathroom for
the rest of the night.

50:06.929 --> 50:08.547
Was it at least a small roach?

50:08.549 --> 50:09.380
Oh no.

50:09.382 --> 50:10.837
Small roaches were not welcome

50:10.839 --> 50:13.007
in my old apartment, only the big ones.

50:13.009 --> 50:14.087
These were the kind of roaches

50:14.089 --> 50:16.157
that could go to the
bank and take out a loan.

50:16.159 --> 50:17.409
That's how big they were.

50:18.529 --> 50:20.977
As much as I loathe roaches,

50:20.979 --> 50:23.547
I'd rather eat one than
drink that nasty shit again.

50:23.549 --> 50:26.097
I didn't think you were
actually going to drink it.

50:26.099 --> 50:27.017
I thought you would've been like,

50:27.019 --> 50:29.197
I'm not drinking that
shit, are you nucking futs?

50:29.199 --> 50:31.377
And I would've been like,

50:31.379 --> 50:33.117
okay, I wouldn't have drank it either.

50:33.119 --> 50:35.107
But you went above and beyond.

Now as much as I'd like
to relive my childhood

51:48.949 --> 51:51.487
there are some perks to being an adult.

51:51.489 --> 51:54.757
Like soiling the things that
made being a kid so great.

51:54.759 --> 51:57.371
I'm a huge children's show conspiracist.

51:57.373 --> 51:58.204
Me too.

51:58.206 --> 51:59.637
Lemme hear one of your theories.

51:59.639 --> 52:00.747
Lemme hear one of yours.

52:00.749 --> 52:01.617
I asked you first.

52:01.619 --> 52:03.287
I asked you second.

52:03.289 --> 52:06.517
Okay, I have one for Out of the Box.

52:06.519 --> 52:07.617
You remember that show?

52:07.619 --> 52:08.837
Of course.

52:08.839 --> 52:10.567
Okay, well get ready to hate me,

52:10.569 --> 52:14.914
be cause your beloved Out of
the Box glorified pedophilia.

52:14.916 --> 52:16.049
What?

52:16.051 --> 52:17.357
Look at the premise.

52:17.359 --> 52:18.926
A bunch of kids go and play in a box

52:18.928 --> 52:21.927
with a grown-ass man
and a grown-ass woman.

52:21.929 --> 52:24.017
Tony and Vivian were saints.

52:24.019 --> 52:25.407
Were they?

52:25.409 --> 52:28.267
Did you ever ask yourself,
what do they really want?

52:28.269 --> 52:30.937
And, more importantly,
did these kids' parents

52:30.939 --> 52:33.597
give Tony and Vivian permission to play

52:33.599 --> 52:38.357
with their kids for hours on
end in a box unsupervised?

52:38.359 --> 52:39.190
I think not.

52:39.192 --> 52:41.877
Mm, I would've never gotten pedophilia

52:41.879 --> 52:42.737
from Out of the Box.

52:42.739 --> 52:44.557
Of course not.

52:44.559 --> 52:46.747
But who were Tony and Vivian?

52:46.749 --> 52:48.307
What did they do for a living?

52:48.309 --> 52:50.957
And why did they have so much free time

52:50.959 --> 52:54.167
to play with these kids
alone in a fuckin' box?

52:54.169 --> 52:56.327
The whole come play with us ploy was

52:56.329 --> 52:58.997
just a way to lure these
innocent children away

52:58.999 --> 53:02.307
so Tony and Vivian,
these so-called saints,

53:02.309 --> 53:03.687
could have their way with them.

53:03.689 --> 53:05.763
That sounds like a defamation
lawsuit in the works.

53:05.765 --> 53:06.596
What?

53:06.598 --> 53:08.027
These are just theories.

53:08.029 --> 53:10.467
Fictitious notions to help people like me,

53:10.469 --> 53:13.057
who wish they could live
in the '90s forever,

53:13.059 --> 53:15.767
cope with the lost early years.

53:15.769 --> 53:18.287
If I ruin the images of my
favorite childhood shows,

53:18.289 --> 53:20.711
it cuts back on the sense of longing.

53:20.713 --> 53:22.277
I'm just having a little fun with you.

53:22.279 --> 53:23.787
I'm in the same boat.

53:23.789 --> 53:24.620
I know.

53:24.622 --> 53:26.977
So tell me one of your theories.

53:26.979 --> 53:29.827
I have a Johnny Bravo theory

53:29.829 --> 53:31.320
Let's hear it.

53:31.322 --> 53:32.155
Okay.

53:34.139 --> 53:37.587
So, I always found myself asking,

53:37.589 --> 53:39.327
after watching Johnny Bravo,

53:39.329 --> 53:41.167
why he never gets any girls?

53:41.169 --> 53:44.047
Yes, he's an asshole, yes, he's arrogant,

53:44.049 --> 53:45.887
yes, he lacks subtlety,

53:45.889 --> 53:49.597
but in the real world, how
many girls go after jerks?

53:49.599 --> 53:50.657
A lot!

53:50.659 --> 53:53.277
So every girl that Johnny has any type

53:53.279 --> 53:56.087
of interaction with always hates him?

53:56.089 --> 53:57.397
I don't buy it.

53:57.399 --> 53:59.847
Well, he did live at home with his mom.

53:59.849 --> 54:01.597
These girls don't know that.

54:01.599 --> 54:02.807
How could they know that?

54:02.809 --> 54:04.947
They're just meeting
him for the first time.

54:04.949 --> 54:07.327
But that's something else.

54:07.329 --> 54:10.267
Here's my theory on why he's
so unlucky with the ladies.

54:10.269 --> 54:13.247
The Johnny Bravo that we,
as audience members see,

54:13.249 --> 54:15.077
isn't the real Johnny Bravo.

54:15.079 --> 54:18.787
The real Johnny Bravo is short, bald,

54:18.789 --> 54:21.277
possibly smelly, round.

54:21.279 --> 54:23.727
See, in his distorted mind, he created

54:23.729 --> 54:26.317
an idealized projection of his inner self.

54:26.319 --> 54:28.117
The person he aspired to be.

54:28.119 --> 54:32.497
So on the inside he's tall,
good-looking, strapping.

54:32.499 --> 54:35.097
The quintessential manly man.

54:35.099 --> 54:36.837
In the Johnny Bravo universe,

54:36.839 --> 54:38.907
the women that Johnny Bravo
interact with Johnny Bravo

54:38.909 --> 54:41.427
aren't seeing the Johnny
Bravo that we see.

54:41.429 --> 54:44.757
They're seeing a loser.

54:44.759 --> 54:46.467
His true self.

54:46.469 --> 54:48.887
I'll never look at
Johnny Bravo the same way.

54:48.889 --> 54:51.977
That's all I wanted.

54:51.979 --> 54:53.647
So, tell me something.

54:53.649 --> 54:54.977
Is it true that girls hate it

54:54.979 --> 54:57.243
when guys send hey as the first message?

54:57.245 --> 55:00.927
I'm indifferent to the whole
creative first message thing,

55:00.929 --> 55:03.737
but I do have some friends
that get pretty flustered.

55:03.739 --> 55:04.717
Hmm.

55:04.719 --> 55:06.827
Is it also true that a girl's DMs

55:06.829 --> 55:11.647
are 50% graphically perverted
and 50% bland as hell?

55:11.649 --> 55:15.177
No, it's more like 80%
graphically perverted

55:15.179 --> 55:17.382
and 20% bland as hell.

55:18.619 --> 55:20.987
So, what's the weirdest
thing a guy's said to you?

55:20.989 --> 55:23.857
Oh, I have a Hall of
Fame of weird messages.

55:23.859 --> 55:25.427
Most of them I don't like to repeat,

55:25.429 --> 55:27.445
but I did have this one guy ask

55:27.447 --> 55:29.970
if he could lick the back of my neck.

55:29.972 --> 55:30.803
What?

55:30.805 --> 55:31.636
Yep.

55:31.638 --> 55:32.737
He didn't lead into it,

55:32.739 --> 55:34.897
didn't prepare me for his creepazoidery.

55:34.899 --> 55:36.387
He just went for it.

55:36.389 --> 55:39.047
And usually, I block guys
like that immediately,

55:39.049 --> 55:41.067
but I was kinda curious.

55:41.069 --> 55:44.337
So I asked, why do you wanna
lick the back of my neck?

55:44.339 --> 55:47.808
And he said he wanted to know
what a champion tasted like.

55:47.810 --> 55:49.560

55:49.562 --> 55:52.087

55:52.089 --> 55:53.142

55:54.219 --> 55:56.777
Oh, and I can't tell you
how many dick pics I get.

55:56.779 --> 55:58.537
I get one like every fuckin' day.

55:58.539 --> 55:59.887
I got one this morning.

55:59.889 --> 56:00.817
Shit.

56:00.819 --> 56:02.017

56:02.019 --> 56:03.257
Nope.

56:03.259 --> 56:05.447
That's not even a consideration.

56:05.449 --> 56:08.777
That shit travels online
like an oil spill.

56:08.779 --> 56:10.877
I'm not gonna lose my job because pictures

56:10.879 --> 56:13.227
of me and Mr. Pink are floating around.

56:13.229 --> 56:15.568
Why is your penis called Mr. Pink?

56:15.570 --> 56:20.517
Because he goes in vaginas
and vaginas are pink.

56:20.519 --> 56:21.702
Not all of them.

56:22.824 --> 56:23.657
Ew.

56:24.879 --> 56:27.597
So what's the weirdest thing
a girl's ever said to you?

56:27.599 --> 56:29.487
I once had this girl ask me

56:29.489 --> 56:33.447
if she could borrow $20,000
to bail her dad out of jail.

56:33.449 --> 56:34.280
Are you serious?

56:34.282 --> 56:35.350
Very.

56:35.352 --> 56:36.987
And I told her I couldn't because

56:36.989 --> 56:41.198
I just spent $20K bailing
my own dad out of jail.

56:41.200 --> 56:42.557
Drats.

56:42.559 --> 56:44.997
I also had this one girl
ask me if I was interested

56:44.999 --> 56:48.327
in letting her stick a
stalk of celery up my ass.

56:48.329 --> 56:49.303

has become a legitimate
way to make a connection

won't admit that I use it.

57:12.119 --> 57:14.887
You have no idea how true that is.

57:14.889 --> 57:15.974

58:53.949 --> 58:56.047
That violates so many health codes.

58:56.049 --> 58:58.047
Welcome to my DMs.

58:58.049 --> 59:02.107
Sorry, ZanzyStan46, but
your ass is getting blocked.

59:02.109 --> 59:04.257
These guys are barbarians.

59:04.259 --> 59:05.937
I appreciate how disgusted you are,

59:05.939 --> 59:08.447
but I'm sure you've sent
your titillating messages.

59:08.449 --> 59:11.447
Nope, I'm the boring guy, really.

59:11.449 --> 59:13.650
I usually start off with hey,

59:13.652 --> 59:16.242
or what's your favorite TV show?

59:17.114 --> 59:18.367
I mean, look at our convos,

59:18.369 --> 59:19.707
I haven't said anything too racy.

59:19.709 --> 59:21.397
That's actually true.

59:21.399 --> 59:23.757
You have been pretty racy tonight though.

59:23.759 --> 59:25.667
Cause I'm comfortable.

59:25.669 --> 59:27.877
I have that effect on people.

59:27.879 --> 59:30.077
Okay, Colonel Comfortable,

59:30.079 --> 59:31.677
how many girls have you brought back here?

59:31.679 --> 59:33.567
Not including me.

59:33.569 --> 59:35.427
Well that certainly escalated.

59:35.429 --> 59:37.187
Look, the past is the past.

59:37.189 --> 59:38.797
I'm not gonna hold anything against you.

59:38.799 --> 59:40.607
I'm just curious.

59:40.609 --> 59:45.047
I mean, in total, six
girls have been here.

59:45.049 --> 59:46.782
One of whom was underage.

59:47.808 --> 59:49.357
Um.

59:49.359 --> 59:50.957
I didn't do anything with her.

59:50.959 --> 59:52.847
I thought she was 24.

59:52.849 --> 59:54.427
The second I realized that she

59:54.429 --> 59:57.567
was born post The Amanda
Show, I made her leave.

59:57.569 --> 01:00:01.907
So one of six girls, you
didn't do anything with.

01:00:01.909 --> 01:00:03.777
What about the other ones?

01:00:03.779 --> 01:00:06.902
You're not even trying to
approach this with any delicacy.

01:00:08.189 --> 01:00:11.017
Why not just ask what
you really wanna ask?

01:00:11.019 --> 01:00:12.637
How many girls have I slept with?

01:00:12.639 --> 01:00:13.627
How many?

01:00:13.629 --> 01:00:14.579
In my whole life?

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:16.627
Four.

01:00:16.629 --> 01:00:17.800
Only four?

01:00:17.802 --> 01:00:18.697
Only four.

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:20.282
You wanna get specific?

01:00:21.539 --> 01:00:23.667
I was a virgin all through high school.

01:00:23.669 --> 01:00:26.367
I lost my virginity when I was 20,

01:00:26.369 --> 01:00:29.037
and only had one other partner in college.

01:00:29.039 --> 01:00:31.807
After graduating, I started
using the dating apps

01:00:31.809 --> 01:00:34.237
and only managed to
hook up with two girls.

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:35.637
No game?

01:00:35.639 --> 01:00:38.127
Actually, and I'm not
saying this to brag,

01:00:38.129 --> 01:00:40.067
my body count could've been higher.

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:41.187
I had opportunities.

01:00:41.189 --> 01:00:42.820
So, why didn't you get it in?

01:00:42.822 --> 01:00:45.472
I don't know any guys
to shy away from sex.

01:00:46.479 --> 01:00:48.397
Why are you shaking your head?

01:00:48.399 --> 01:00:50.647
Cause I'm gonna sound like
such a wimp after saying this.

01:00:50.649 --> 01:00:52.682
Let me decide that, alright?

01:00:54.329 --> 01:00:57.967
I haven't had many
partners because I guess

01:00:57.969 --> 01:01:00.497
I like the idea of being a mack more

01:01:00.499 --> 01:01:02.522
than actually being a mack.

01:01:03.429 --> 01:01:06.037
Now, of course, in the
presence of my boys,

01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:07.787
I've had women all around town,

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:10.927
but I wanna return the
honesty that you shared

01:01:10.929 --> 01:01:13.617
with me with a little honesty of my own.

01:01:13.619 --> 01:01:17.947
I say a lot of things, but
I'm not having sex like that.

01:01:17.949 --> 01:01:20.817
I mean, I can be very sexually explicit

01:01:20.819 --> 01:01:22.307
with the things I say,

01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:24.959
but actually going out there
and knocking 'em dead...

01:01:27.629 --> 01:01:28.987
The only person aside from you

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:31.677
that knows this is my friend Hut,

01:01:31.679 --> 01:01:34.167
and even he gets the edited version.

01:01:34.169 --> 01:01:37.257
He thinks I've just hit a dry spell.

01:01:37.259 --> 01:01:39.477
He doesn't know my low number

01:01:39.479 --> 01:01:42.892
of sexual partners is purposeful.

01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:48.437
Alright, I give you full
permission to rag on me.

01:01:48.439 --> 01:01:49.547
I just don't want you thinking

01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:52.587
that I'm the average fuckboy,
cause I'm really not.

01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:53.858
So...

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:58.717
So, does this mean your dick
isn't really named Mr. Pink?

01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:00.082
His real name is Sheldon,

01:02:01.079 --> 01:02:03.779
but he has been known to
answer to Mr. Pink sometimes.

01:02:05.519 --> 01:02:07.584
How do I know you're
telling me the truth?

01:02:07.586 --> 01:02:10.067
What if this is just a line
you feed all the other girls?

01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:11.937
I wouldn't do that.

01:02:11.939 --> 01:02:13.370
Even if I was trying to run game on you,

01:02:13.372 --> 01:02:15.937
I wouldn't do it by downplaying the number

01:02:15.939 --> 01:02:17.397
of girls I've slept with.

01:02:17.399 --> 01:02:18.230
Why not?

01:02:18.232 --> 01:02:19.677
Sensitive guys are in.

01:02:19.679 --> 01:02:21.827
Nothing that I'm saying is a line.

01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:23.459
This is the real Picasso.

01:02:24.399 --> 01:02:26.957
Isn't there woman's intuition?

01:02:26.959 --> 01:02:31.897
You have a knack for sensing
the shit of the bull.

01:02:31.899 --> 01:02:34.649
Is there anything telling
you that I'm being dishonest?

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:37.782
I'm all talk.

01:02:38.819 --> 01:02:41.517
Truthfully, the idea of hooking up

01:02:41.519 --> 01:02:45.877
with hundreds of girls
kinda gives me anxiety,

01:02:45.879 --> 01:02:47.887
but I wear the pimp hat because...

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:49.952
Because, you're a chameleon.

01:02:52.879 --> 01:02:55.887
I've only been with
five guys, for the record.

01:02:55.889 --> 01:02:58.617
I haven't had sex in over three years.

01:02:58.619 --> 01:03:01.797
I've been on some dates,
but nothing got physical.

01:03:01.799 --> 01:03:03.922
Not since Mr. Not So Perfect.

01:03:05.342 --> 01:03:06.877
Do you go to these guys' houses?

01:03:06.879 --> 01:03:10.717
At first, I vowed to keep
meetings in public areas.

01:03:10.719 --> 01:03:13.817
You know, just in case I had
to deal with another psycho.

01:03:13.819 --> 01:03:17.037
But then I realized a lot of guys

01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:19.377
wear their Mr. Perfect masks.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:20.907
They say what they think they need

01:03:20.909 --> 01:03:23.567
to say to get the second date.

01:03:23.569 --> 01:03:25.527
Anything to get the
final prize, which is...

01:03:25.529 --> 01:03:26.952
The boom boom boom.

01:03:28.279 --> 01:03:29.997
When I finally got my zing back

01:03:29.999 --> 01:03:33.287
and stopped thinking
every guy was a predator,

01:03:33.289 --> 01:03:36.397
I started accepting invitations to houses.

01:03:36.399 --> 01:03:38.587
Which I know that's a
very unsafe thing to do,

01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:42.897
but I think the best
way to observe someone

01:03:42.899 --> 01:03:46.677
is in their natural habitat, their home.

01:03:46.679 --> 01:03:47.970
I'm not a complete lamebrain,

01:03:47.972 --> 01:03:51.907
I do have mace and other
defensive materials on deck.

01:03:51.909 --> 01:03:53.287
Now I'm the scared one.

01:03:53.289 --> 01:03:54.662
Just what I wanted.

01:03:56.289 --> 01:03:58.287
Okay, I wanna see something.

01:03:58.289 --> 01:04:00.995
I wanna see your best fuckboy.

01:04:00.997 --> 01:04:01.914
What?

01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:05.397
Act like I'm not me, you're not you.

01:04:05.399 --> 01:04:07.047
We're strangers in the night.

01:04:07.049 --> 01:04:08.817
How would you approach me if you were

01:04:08.819 --> 01:04:10.732
actually the playa you pretend to be?

01:04:11.669 --> 01:04:13.337
Isn't it too early for role playing?

01:04:13.339 --> 01:04:14.377
Shut up, come on.

01:04:14.379 --> 01:04:17.877
This is your chance to
authenticate your smoothness.

01:04:17.879 --> 01:04:19.597
I want to see you pick me up!

01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:21.487
But I already got you to my apartment.

01:04:21.489 --> 01:04:23.327
We're not in your apartment.

01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:26.597
Pretend we're in a cafe.

01:04:26.599 --> 01:04:30.357
I'm already here drinking
my raspberry iced latte.

01:04:30.359 --> 01:04:34.727
You come in for your usual
double espresso and crumb cake.

01:04:34.729 --> 01:04:37.567
You see me over yonder,
attached to my phone.

01:04:37.569 --> 01:04:40.042
What ever does the big playa-playa do?

01:04:41.489 --> 01:04:42.892
You really wanna do this?

01:04:42.894 --> 01:04:45.242
I wasn't oddly specific for nothing.

01:04:46.859 --> 01:04:47.692
Okay.

01:04:57.649 --> 01:04:58.837
Okay, cut.

01:04:58.839 --> 01:05:01.087
Can you not walk like
you're about to backhand me?

01:05:01.089 --> 01:05:03.827
I was just feeling out
the character, alright?

01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:04.782
Do it again.

01:05:25.149 --> 01:05:25.980
Hi.

01:05:25.982 --> 01:05:27.397
Hello.

01:05:27.399 --> 01:05:30.417
What's that, a raspberry latte?

01:05:30.419 --> 01:05:31.382
Yes, it is.

01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:35.127
Sweet drink for a sweet lady.

01:05:35.129 --> 01:05:36.846
Okay, you're not good at this.

01:05:36.848 --> 01:05:38.690
No, no, no, no, lemme do it again.

01:05:38.692 --> 01:05:41.025
A sweet drink for a sweet lady?

01:05:41.027 --> 01:05:42.077
That works on some girls.

01:05:42.079 --> 01:05:44.077
It doesn't work on this girl.

01:05:44.079 --> 01:05:45.327
Start over?

01:05:45.329 --> 01:05:46.267
Start over.

01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:47.357
But you're really not doing well.

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:49.322
Oh, everybody's a critic.

01:06:08.859 --> 01:06:09.797
Hey.

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:10.632
Hi.

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:13.797
I see you're enjoying your drink,

01:06:13.799 --> 01:06:15.697
and I don't wanna take
up too much of your time,

01:06:15.699 --> 01:06:19.207
but I knew I'd kick myself
later if I didn't come over

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:21.559
and say something, even
if nothing comes of it.

01:06:22.419 --> 01:06:23.322
I'm Darryl.

01:06:24.169 --> 01:06:25.837
You don't have to tell me your name,

01:06:25.839 --> 01:06:28.772
I'll just call you beautiful.

01:06:30.849 --> 01:06:33.187
I've seen you in here everyday this week,

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:35.017
coming in, drinking your latte,

01:06:35.019 --> 01:06:37.597
and I've always wanted to talk to you.

01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:39.897
But I'm sure you've got
guys kicking down your door

01:06:39.899 --> 01:06:43.037
all the time, so the
original plan was just

01:06:43.039 --> 01:06:45.047
to let you have this time to yourself.

01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:47.952
But seven times.

01:06:49.209 --> 01:06:51.997
I've seen you here seven times.

01:06:51.999 --> 01:06:54.557
Usually, I don't believe in signs,

01:06:54.559 --> 01:06:56.737
but this can't be ignored.

01:06:56.739 --> 01:06:58.342
I had to come talk to you.

01:06:59.199 --> 01:07:02.812
Now, I'm not asking for your number,

01:07:03.939 --> 01:07:05.107
and I'm not asking you out on a date.

01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:06.982
I just wanted to introduce myself.

01:07:08.949 --> 01:07:10.377
So I'm gonna go over there and grab

01:07:10.379 --> 01:07:12.972
my double espresso and crumb cake,

01:07:13.859 --> 01:07:17.017
then go sit over there, and if you wanted

01:07:17.019 --> 01:07:21.852
to join me I would not mind that.

01:07:24.929 --> 01:07:28.072
Nice to meet you, beautiful.

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:51.497
Not too shabby, Darryl.

01:07:51.499 --> 01:07:53.568
Not too shabby at all.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.727
I'm not a wizard, but I got the magic.

01:07:56.729 --> 01:07:58.360
Saying shit like that is gonna annul

01:07:58.362 --> 01:08:01.817
everything you just did
so no more of that, 'kay?

01:08:01.819 --> 01:08:04.137
Do I get you stamp of approval, though?

01:08:04.139 --> 01:08:06.277
I suppose.

01:08:06.279 --> 01:08:07.707
Then where's my reward?

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:09.157
What do you want?

01:08:09.159 --> 01:08:10.727
Some heroin would be nice.

01:08:10.729 --> 01:08:12.930
Sure, let me just
grab some from my purse.

01:08:14.637 --> 01:08:16.857
No, but there is
something that I do want.

01:08:16.857 --> 01:08:16.858
- No, but there is something that I do want.
- And what would that be?

01:08:16.858 --> 01:08:18.410
And what would that be?

01:08:20.466 --> 01:08:22.365
Um...

01:08:22.367 --> 01:08:23.578
Um...

01:08:24.557 --> 01:08:26.127
I, uh...

01:08:28.827 --> 01:08:29.660
Oh my God!

01:08:37.978 --> 01:08:42.274
You're terrible at being
yourself, you know that?

01:08:42.277 --> 01:08:43.885
You knew I wanted to kiss you?

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:44.718
Duh.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.332
We've been leading to it for a while now.

01:08:46.334 --> 01:08:48.175
You should've kissed me
when we were by the stairs.

01:08:48.176 --> 01:08:49.984
I know, I wanted to.

01:08:49.987 --> 01:08:51.706
That would've been a moment.

01:08:51.707 --> 01:08:55.768
I just, I usually like to
ask girls before I kiss them?

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:57.215
Why?

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:58.795
I don't wanna throw myself on someone.

01:08:58.796 --> 01:08:59.640
That's weird.

01:09:00.966 --> 01:09:03.145
You wouldn't have been
throwing yourself on me.

01:09:03.147 --> 01:09:04.800
I wanted it too.

01:09:04.801 --> 01:09:05.774
But what if you didn't?

01:09:05.777 --> 01:09:07.490
That's what the mace is for.

01:09:09.367 --> 01:09:11.895
After you shave, do you
slap on the aftershave

01:09:11.897 --> 01:09:13.627
or do you dab it on gently?

01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:15.295
Dab it on gently.

01:09:15.296 --> 01:09:16.675
Of course you do.

01:09:16.676 --> 01:09:19.535
Sometimes you gotta throw
caution to the wind.

01:09:19.537 --> 01:09:21.765
You talked about woman's intuition right?

01:09:21.767 --> 01:09:23.175
Guys have it too.

01:09:23.176 --> 01:09:25.185
You knew I wanted to kiss you.

01:09:25.187 --> 01:09:27.319
You felt exactly what I felt.

01:09:27.321 --> 01:09:28.871
You should've just went for it.

01:09:38.487 --> 01:09:39.805
Much better.

01:09:39.807 --> 01:09:42.630
But next time, do it without
us having to talk about it.

01:09:43.594 --> 01:09:44.649
Next time?

01:09:44.652 --> 01:09:45.652
Next time.

01:09:49.627 --> 01:09:51.807
Weren't we supposed to
watch a movie tonight?

01:09:51.807 --> 01:09:51.808
- Weren't we supposed to watch a movie tonight?
- I think we were.

01:09:51.808 --> 01:09:53.715
I think we were.

01:09:53.716 --> 01:09:54.775
We still can.

01:09:54.777 --> 01:09:56.395
Young is the night.

01:09:56.397 --> 01:09:57.435
You wanna pick?

01:09:57.437 --> 01:09:59.045
I shall pick the genre.

01:09:59.047 --> 01:10:01.025
Comedy all the way.

01:10:01.027 --> 01:10:03.760
If it's comedy you want,
it's comedy you'll get.

01:10:05.223 --> 01:10:06.844
I know exactly what to pick.
