WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.137
Lady Luck
is on your side
from LA to Vegas.

00:03.171 --> 00:06.707
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?
Don't cockpit-block me.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.042
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.743
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:09.777 --> 00:11.812
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:11.845 --> 00:12.980
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.482
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.583
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.586
DAVE :
This is your captain.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.654
As we make our final descent
into Los Angeles,

00:20.688 --> 00:23.357
we here at Jackpot would like
to thank you for being a...

00:23.391 --> 00:25.993
Son of a bitch!

00:26.026 --> 00:28.529
You bunch of useless bastards!

00:28.562 --> 00:29.830
How do you miss that shot?

00:29.863 --> 00:30.998
(sports commentator speaking
over phone)

00:31.031 --> 00:32.533
Should you be doing that
right now?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.268
I got a lot of money
riding on this game.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.669
More than your car is worth.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.438
You bet $80,000 on a game?

00:37.471 --> 00:40.341
What? No, what the hell
kind of car do you...

00:40.374 --> 00:43.211
Somebody grab a rebound!

00:43.244 --> 00:45.012
You know, if you want to focus
on that, I can land the...

00:45.045 --> 00:48.082
Stop talking. Every time you
talk, the other team scores.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.550
Damn it.
Now that you're not talking,

00:49.583 --> 00:50.951
the other team is scoring more.

00:50.984 --> 00:54.688
-Talk again.
-Um, well, wh-when I was young,

00:54.722 --> 00:57.558
I-I saw my best friend get
kidnapped from a movie theater.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.260
I didn't say anything.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.794
Come on, come on, shoot.

01:00.828 --> 01:03.197
-Shoot! Shoot!

01:03.231 --> 01:06.033
Oh, God.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.969
Did you win?

01:09.002 --> 01:10.204
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.140
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.143
*

01:18.979 --> 01:21.715
Remember that announcement
I made a few minutes ago?

01:21.749 --> 01:24.218
About everyone closing
their laptops before landing?

01:24.252 --> 01:26.053
You're right.
I didn't mean you.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.621
You're different.
You're special.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.823
You're not
understanding sarcasm.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.292
I'm sorry, Bernard,

01:31.325 --> 01:33.494
but my professor evaluations
just came through.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.396
And I only got one apple
out of five.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.931
I once got a staph infection
at an Airbnb.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.467
I still gave it two stars.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.302
Well, you could think of it
as a challenge.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.903
And you have no idea
how boring it gets

01:42.936 --> 01:44.505
-getting only good reviews
all the time.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.106
-Mm. -Especially
when those good reviews

01:46.140 --> 01:48.842
are covered by nothing
but a thin layer of sweatpant.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.444
I remember the good old days
when people

01:50.478 --> 01:52.246
would dress up to be perverts.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.114
I once saw Gregory Peck
walk into a strip club

01:54.148 --> 01:55.649
in top hat and tails.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.352
You know the worst part? None of
the students even left comments.

01:58.386 --> 02:01.255
How am I supposed to know what
I'm doing wrong?

02:01.289 --> 02:05.025
Hey. I say it's better
without comments.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.695
Hearing the truth never helps.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.763
I'll give you example.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.599
Hey, you have weird neck,

02:11.632 --> 02:13.567
and you gave it to baby.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.870
You see?

02:18.239 --> 02:19.573
-COLIN: That doesn't
make it better.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.546
Thank you for flying Jackpot.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.449
Thanks. Oh. Wait, no, no, no,
no, no. That's not garbage.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.618
My life is in here.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.152
I got evicted from my apartment

02:32.186 --> 02:33.654
and only had ten minutes
to pack.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.456
This is everything I own
worth keeping.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.491
Oh, Ronnie. You continue to
teach me that "sad"

02:37.525 --> 02:40.228
is a diamond
with infinite facets.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.830
-How did you get yourself
evicted? -Well...

02:47.935 --> 02:49.570
Instead of focusing
on the negative,

02:49.603 --> 02:51.739
they could've just been happy
I'm trying to quit smoking.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.174
I wish it was 2005,
so I could call you a hot mess.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.076
I mean, I can tell
how many glasses of wine

02:56.109 --> 02:57.811
you had last night
just by looking at you.

02:57.845 --> 02:58.912
-Three.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.481
Oh, girl, and it was boxed.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.882
Actually, it was canned.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.150
Bernard, that's brilliant.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.585
That's the kind of insight
I need.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.986
Could you come to my class
and tell me

03:06.019 --> 03:07.421
what's wrong with my teaching?

03:07.455 --> 03:09.223
I need your brutal
but cheeky honesty.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.724
No, don't help him. Help me.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.660
Okay, you have the posture
of a Disney witch.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.262
No, not more insults.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.830
I need somewhere to stay
until I find a new apartment.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.500
Okay, fine. You can stay
with me. Briefly.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.934
And you, King's Speech.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.703
I'll come to your class
and rip you apart.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.772
But I need to know:
do you have a family history

03:24.805 --> 03:26.440
of insecurity and depression?

03:26.474 --> 03:29.543
Well, I'm British.
So, yes. Yeah.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.083
Hey, Captain Dave.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.685
Captain Dave!

03:37.718 --> 03:39.920
Run to my voice.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.689
Captain Dave.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.624
Oh, hey, Artem.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.058
I didn't see you there.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.695
Oh, that was a tough loss.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.464
You know, I wish
everyone could be winners,

03:50.498 --> 03:52.633
but then there would be no one

03:52.666 --> 03:54.302
that owed me money.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.137
By the way, you owe me money.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.274
You know what? I don't
have it on me or near me.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.710
I will get it the day
after today.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.977
-Deal.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.145
Just tell me where you live.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.114
I'll come, get money.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.483
I'm actually flying out to
Wyoming, but don't worry,

04:09.517 --> 04:11.218
I'll let you know as soon
as I'm back in town.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.353
Oh, here's my ride.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.724
Say hello to Wyoming.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.594
Of all the Tetons,
they have the grandest.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.668
Hi, roomie.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.503
Here are the house rules.

04:29.537 --> 04:30.971
No shoes on
the Bowron sheepskin,

04:31.004 --> 04:32.673
pillows are decorative
unless otherwise noted,

04:32.706 --> 04:34.475
and your bathroom is the
Bristol Farms down the street.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.645
This is the whole list.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.147
I didn't know they made
a font this small.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.683
6:00 is kimono hour.
If you don't have a kimono,

04:42.716 --> 04:44.918
you'll be rented one
at a competitive rate.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.254
I think I have one of those.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.622
That is a sari.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.157
What are you trying to pull?

04:50.190 --> 04:52.125
Okay. So, lots of rules.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.194
But that's okay,
I can handle this.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.829
Anything else I should know?

04:55.863 --> 04:59.367
Yes. Never-- no matter
what you see, what you hear--

04:59.400 --> 05:02.570
never, ever, open that red door.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.442
So, welcome, girl.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.184
Oh, hey, Artem, I know I said
I'd be back soon,

05:17.217 --> 05:18.886
but I'm still in Yellowstone.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.021
Three, two, one.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.223
Wow, that's a reliable geyser.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.993
Well, got to go. No...
reception.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.262
Ronnie?

05:30.698 --> 05:32.633
Hands off, I have Hep C!

05:32.666 --> 05:34.034
I'm...

05:34.067 --> 05:35.969
I'm sorry,
that's a little technique

05:36.003 --> 05:37.971
I learned at
a self-defense class.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.339
Did you sleep here?

05:39.373 --> 05:40.841
What happened to staying
with Bernard?

05:40.874 --> 05:42.342
It just didn't work out.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.979
-BERNARD: Ronnie.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.915
Was I not clear?

05:47.948 --> 05:50.418
So we mutually agreed
to part ways.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.754
It was just so many rules, and
rules are for work, you know?

05:53.787 --> 05:56.924
When I get home, I just want to
relax and open any door I want.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.892
Well, you can't stay here.
Sleeping in places like this

05:58.926 --> 06:00.928
is probably how you got Hep C
in the first place.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.663
No, I don't...
I don't actually have...

06:02.696 --> 06:04.498
Never mind. I'll be fine.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.166
When I'm in L.A.,
I'll sleep here,

06:06.199 --> 06:09.269
and on layovers, Jackpot puts us
up in a hotel anyway.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.705
Lots of flight attendants do it,
just look at Mernine.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.241
This is my favorite episode

06:14.274 --> 06:16.610
-of Friends.
-Oh, hey, Mernine.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.112
Look, I hate seeing you
like this.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.415
-And as your mentor...
-You're not my mentor.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.451
...it's my job to help you tap
into your potential.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.952
So I'm gonna make you an offer

06:24.985 --> 06:26.620
I've never extended
to anyone before.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.722
I'm inviting you to stay with me

06:28.756 --> 06:31.258
until you get back on your feet.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.960
Thank you, but I'm fine.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.595
This place isn't that bad.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.465
I have a roof over my head,
a comfortable couch.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.932
Mernine is 34 years old.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.768
Yeah, let's get out of here.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.237
Thank you for flying Jackpot.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.308
And so the principle
of opportunity cost,

06:48.341 --> 06:51.378
as demonstrated very clearly
in this next slide is...

06:51.411 --> 06:52.613
Why are the lights on?

06:52.646 --> 06:54.615
What's going on?

06:54.648 --> 06:57.551
I'll tell you
what's going on. You.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.987
And on and on and on and on.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.254
You bored everyone out of here.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.923
Well, not everyone.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.058
Thank you for staying, Alex. Oh.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.160
It was too dangerous to leave
with the lights off.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.430
I thought about it.
Thought about it a lot.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.299
So how did I do?

07:12.332 --> 07:13.601
Give it to me straight.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.469
I'm gonna start with
what you did right.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.505
You asked me to come here.

07:18.806 --> 07:19.907
That's it.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.308
Okay, that can't be it.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.343
Come on, this is
a compliment sandwich situation,

07:23.376 --> 07:25.145
I'm assuming. There's
gonna be more at the end?

07:25.178 --> 07:27.781
This sandwich is open-faced.
You're so dull.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.784
You're like a textbook that made
a wish to become a real boy.

07:30.818 --> 07:31.952
Well, what do I do?

07:31.985 --> 07:33.954
I mean, I need your help.
Improve me.

07:33.987 --> 07:37.357
Sorry, I don't build people up,
I just tear 'em down.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.927
But I do know someone
who's very good with men

07:39.960 --> 07:41.495
and up for the challenge.

07:41.529 --> 07:44.197
Who's horny for sex

07:44.231 --> 07:45.833
That's "economics."

07:45.866 --> 07:47.334
Are you serious right now?

07:49.002 --> 07:51.004
Thanks again for letting me
crash with you, Dave.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.339
You don't
have to thank me, Ronnie.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.340
That's what I'm here for.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.208
That and Herbalife supplements.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.110
It worked for me,
it can work for you.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.445
But we'll get to that later.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.114
Hey, you know what, I'm
actually not parked in this lot.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.983
Do you want to just give me
your address

08:03.016 --> 08:04.652
-No need.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.986
We're already here.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.354
I don't understand.

08:07.387 --> 08:08.689
This is my home.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.423
Welcome to...

08:12.192 --> 08:14.161
...Parking Lot B.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.840
So, we got a Ping-Pong table
and dining patio.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.677
There's a fire pit over there.
And that's Ryshard.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.846
-He's a beautiful theremin
player.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.315
Well, we're guessing. None of us
heard a theremin before.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.818
And that little honey
right there

08:37.851 --> 08:39.887
is my place.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.889
Her name's Lucy.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.523
The trailer, not the mermaid.

08:43.557 --> 08:44.992
The mermaid's name is Seayoncé.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.327
Wait, this is
really where you live--

08:47.360 --> 08:50.197
in a trailer park
in an airport parking lot?

08:50.230 --> 08:52.399
Trailer park? Please.

08:52.432 --> 08:56.169
Parking Lot B is
a trailer aviation community.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.738
It's our sanctuary.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.207
Everyone has a story
of how this place saved them.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.944
For me, it pulled me out of
the rubble of my third marriage.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.614
Yeah, yeah,
it does have a FEMA vibe.

09:06.647 --> 09:10.117
And the people here
are the finest you'll ever meet.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.620
We have a true kinship,
like a group of teenagers

09:12.653 --> 09:14.287
who accidentally killed a man
last summer.

09:14.321 --> 09:18.125
Captain D in the place to be!

09:18.158 --> 09:20.728
Hey! Craig and Danny.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.730
They're structures mechanics
for American

09:22.763 --> 09:25.699
and two damn fine carpenters.

09:25.733 --> 09:29.102
And that cool kitten
is Hillary Eileen.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.038
She's a customer service agent
for Spirit,

09:31.071 --> 09:34.241
but around here, she's known
as our chief vibe officer.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.777
How's the vibe today,
Hillary Eileen?

09:36.810 --> 09:37.645
Chill.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.980
You're damn right it is.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.251
-That's Manny's drum circle.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.788
Gonna be some fire
on the mountain tonight.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.758
Okay, uh, you know what, Dave,

09:50.791 --> 09:53.560
this-this all seems really,
uh, interesting,

09:53.593 --> 09:55.428
-but I just... I just don't know

09:55.462 --> 09:56.496
if this place is for me!

09:56.529 --> 09:58.966
-I mean, it's not really...
-Sorry.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.434
I missed that.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.136
You have to time your talking
to the flyovers.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.304
You'll pick up on it eventually.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.839
It happens every three minutes.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.407
I was saying
this is really weird,

10:07.440 --> 10:09.509
and I'm just gonna go back
to the crew lounge.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.511
Mernine's making a corned beef
for dinner.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.113
I was skeptical at first, too.

10:13.146 --> 10:17.050
But that was before I realized
what this place is really about.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.619
Freedom.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.588
You don't have to worry
about anyone giving you a list

10:21.621 --> 10:23.691
of rules here,
because there are no rules.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.827
In Lot B, we switch our lives

10:26.860 --> 10:28.696
to "airplane mode."

10:28.729 --> 10:31.965
That actually does sound
pretty good.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.467
So, what do you say we head over
to Manny's Winnebago

10:34.501 --> 10:36.103
for a Craig-blown glass

10:36.136 --> 10:38.505
of Cheryl's homemade wine?

10:38.538 --> 10:40.540
*

10:49.349 --> 10:50.818
* Let's take it easy

10:50.851 --> 10:52.986
* And have a drink or more

10:53.020 --> 10:54.621
* And watch the sailboats,
let them float *

10:54.654 --> 10:56.724
* Till Marina calls them home

10:56.757 --> 10:59.059
* Let's go to Paris

10:59.092 --> 11:01.361
* Possibly Peru

11:01.394 --> 11:03.496
Shoo! Shoo!

11:03.530 --> 11:06.299
* Say you wanna see
the world with me *

11:06.333 --> 11:08.902
* Say you wanna leave today

11:08.936 --> 11:10.971
* Say you wanna run away
with me... *

11:11.004 --> 11:14.307
-I love Parking...

11:14.341 --> 11:17.210
Lot B!

11:20.948 --> 11:22.082
Before I can teach you anything,

11:22.115 --> 11:23.416
I need to know
what I'm working with.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.352
So get up here,
pretend it's your class,

11:25.385 --> 11:26.820
and show us what you've got.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.255
-Okay. Ooh!

11:28.288 --> 11:31.358
Hello, class...

11:31.391 --> 11:33.727
-I'm gonna stop you right there.
-Thank you. That was torture.

11:33.761 --> 11:36.864
I'm sorry, no offense,
I don't see how you can help me.

11:36.897 --> 11:40.367
I mean, we work in-- let's just
say vastly different fields.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.669
And I don't doubt your ability
to command an audience.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.337
But you do have
the advantage of being--

11:44.371 --> 11:46.673
what's the word-- naked.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.209
So? Every girl on that stage
is naked. Sit down.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.880
Who can tell me the difference
between a girl

11:52.913 --> 11:56.183
who makes one-dollar tips and a
girl who makes ten

11:56.216 --> 11:57.184
Scars.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.786
Literal and emotional.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.120
Confidence.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.055
The ten-dollar girls
believe in themselves enough

12:02.089 --> 12:03.256
to take chances.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.759
So tell me,
are you a one-dollar stripper

12:05.793 --> 12:07.694
or are you
a ten

12:07.727 --> 12:10.630
I suppose
I'm a ten-dollar stripper.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.033
-No. -Yeah, you're right.
I'm a one-dollar stripper.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.467
-No. -Well,
what do you want me to say?

12:14.501 --> 12:16.569
I want you to say
you're a $20 stripper.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.071
Well, that's not fair.
That wasn't one of the options.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.240
Say it!
Say "I'm a $20 stripper!"

12:20.273 --> 12:21.441
I'm a $20 stripper!

12:21.474 --> 12:22.910
!
-I don't know!

12:22.943 --> 12:25.979
-Louder!
-I am a $20 stripper!

12:26.013 --> 12:27.214
Good.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.149
Now we can begin.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.951
STUDENT:
Excuse me.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.553
Are you guys gonna be using
this room for a while longer?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.388
'Cause, uh,
we're still trying to study.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.058
News flash, study group:
nerd chic is over.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.227
Lovable losers
are just losers again.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.528
Wha...?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.736
Ronnie, we need to talk.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.073
I'm glad you're embracing
Parking Lot B.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.075
And we're all especially
impressed how quickly

12:55.108 --> 12:56.776
-you picked up timing the...

12:58.278 --> 12:59.279
...flyovers.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.281
-But as your mentor...
-Not my mentor.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.916
Fine, then as your friend
and as your mentor,

13:02.950 --> 13:05.418
I'm saying you have
to take it down a notch.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.420
What are you talking about?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.756
All right, let's start
with Danny and Craig.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.093
Don't get me wrong,
I'm all about sexual liberation.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.194
But they are brothers.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.795
And you did make out
with both of them.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.831
And, again, brothers.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.300
In my defense, I thought
they were the same person.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.170
Which brings us
to your drinking.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.471
Look at this.

13:24.504 --> 13:28.876
The life vests
are meant to serve four.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.511
And what about
Hillary Eileen's garden?

13:31.544 --> 13:33.847
All those pigeons
cleaned it out.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.182
It's a garden-- it grows back.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.716
It's seasonal, Ronnie.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.152
We won't see gorgeous tomatoes
like that till next harvest.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.621
I think we need to set
some guidelines.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.223
Oh. So, rules.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.691
No. Guidelines.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.293
Lot B doesn't have rules.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.694
And will you cover up?

13:47.727 --> 13:49.963
There are children landing
in this flight path.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.365
You know what?

13:52.399 --> 13:55.969
You sold this place
like it was a paradise

13:56.003 --> 13:57.837
where we could do
whatever we want,

13:57.871 --> 13:59.306
and now you're getting
pissed off just because

13:59.339 --> 14:01.341
I'm having a little fun.
I mean, what's the big deal?

14:01.374 --> 14:02.910
The big deal
is that I vouched for you,

14:02.943 --> 14:04.811
and now you're taking advantage
of my generosity.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.514
Everything that you do
reflects back on me.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.916
What are you talking about?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.217
None of this affects you.

14:10.250 --> 14:14.054
Captain David, you lied to me!

14:14.087 --> 14:16.589
Artem. How do you know
where I live?

14:16.623 --> 14:19.826
Oh, Ronnie posted many
party pictures on Instagram,

14:19.859 --> 14:22.395
proving you never went
to Yellowstone.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.564
No, you tried to disappear

14:24.597 --> 14:27.000
like the frown on my face
when I see a bubble.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.835
You put this on Instagram?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.737
I told you,
we live off the grid.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.839
We switch our lives
to "airplane mode."

14:32.872 --> 14:34.507
I thought that was a metaphor.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.044
I don't speak in metaphors.
They confuse me.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.946
If you're not gonna
pay me my money,

14:38.979 --> 14:42.082
I'm gonna take some items
from your "Windy-bagel."

14:45.953 --> 14:48.621
Come on, Artem. I'll get you
your money in a few days.

14:48.655 --> 14:52.459
Yeah, until you do, I'm gonna
hold onto your food TV.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.928
What have you done?

14:54.962 --> 14:57.197
This was supposed to be
our place away from groundos,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.099
especially groundos
I owe money to.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.801
How was I supposed to know that?
You can't blame this on me.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.436
Ronnie, you have to choose.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.538
Which one of us
do you like more?

15:05.572 --> 15:08.775
Okay, this one
you can blame on me.

15:08.808 --> 15:11.144
She clearly likes me more.
We made out first.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.046
Which means
you weren't enough for her.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.481
Okay, okay, you guys.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.949
-You guys, it's all right.
-ARTEM: Also,

15:15.983 --> 15:17.617
I'm taking your watch,
and also your milk,

15:17.650 --> 15:20.220
so I don't have to stop
on my way home.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.554
DANNY:
It's not fair!

15:21.588 --> 15:22.822
Mom said I get the next girl.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.958
Fellas, cool it. Come on.
Aah!

15:24.992 --> 15:27.594
My theremin-ing hand--
I think it's broken.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.129
This is a disaster.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.331
Hillary Eileen,
what's the vibe?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.133
-Harsh.
-Oh, no.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.902
This is the first time
it's ever been below dank.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.604
You know what?
You can have her.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.506
-I am out of here!
-Craig, wait.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.408
:
See?

15:41.441 --> 15:42.775
-It fixed itself.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.756
I know a guy
who can patch that right up.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.858
RYSHARD:
This is all your fault, Dave.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.960
Why would you bring her here?

16:00.994 --> 16:03.296
I think it's time
for you to leave.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.539
Is he ready?

16:12.572 --> 16:14.007
I don't know.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.310
We just went over a few things,
but I threw a lot at him.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.485
* She's my cherry pie...

16:25.518 --> 16:27.454
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:27.487 --> 16:30.490
today's class is gonna be
a little different.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.824
* Sweet cherry pie...

16:31.858 --> 16:34.827
So sit back,
and let Professor Colin...

16:34.861 --> 16:37.064
stimulate...

16:37.097 --> 16:38.498
your brain.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.866
* Whoa

16:41.434 --> 16:43.870
"...will trickle down
to the rest of the market."

16:43.903 --> 16:45.405
But it doesn't, does it?

16:45.438 --> 16:48.841
Huh? You're a bad
little textbook, aren't you?

16:48.875 --> 16:50.243
Oh, yeah. You're bad.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.979
And the danger
of too much growth

16:53.012 --> 16:56.349
is the bubble... bursts.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.485
And when supply drops...

16:58.518 --> 17:00.153
Oops.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.656
To meet demand,
prices will slowly...

17:03.690 --> 17:06.359
-rise.
-* She's my cherry pie...

17:06.393 --> 17:08.361
And what's the best way
to visualize

17:08.395 --> 17:10.330
the central limit theorem?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.599
-* Make a grown man cry,
sweet cherry pie * -Oh.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.234
-Oh.
-* Oh, yeah...

17:14.267 --> 17:16.069
I'm gonna make you wait for it.

17:16.103 --> 17:18.505
It's a bell curve!

17:18.538 --> 17:21.574
And when Adam Smith talked
about the "invisible hands,"

17:21.608 --> 17:23.410
what two theories
did that inspire?

17:23.443 --> 17:25.778
Creative destruction and, um...

17:25.812 --> 17:27.680
Come on, Jared.
You can get there.

17:27.714 --> 17:31.684
The invisible hands,
manipulating the market,

17:31.718 --> 17:34.587
working the knots out
of the market...

17:34.621 --> 17:36.223
Spontaneous order!

17:40.327 --> 17:42.295
Oh, how I miss the theatre.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.231
At Grapefruits,
we ring a cowbell

17:44.264 --> 17:46.065
any time that happens.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.805
Hey, Ronnie, look at this.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.208
Captain Dave gave me
a greeting card

17:55.242 --> 17:57.644
with a picture
of an apology cat.

17:57.677 --> 18:01.148
Makes me feel bad
for yelling at him.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.383
Now I am apology cat.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.985
Did he also give you the rest
of the money he owes you?

18:06.018 --> 18:08.155
You are completely
missing the point.

18:13.860 --> 18:14.994
-Yeah.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.296
What happened to you?

18:16.329 --> 18:19.299
Inadvertently made
a student sexually climax. You?

18:19.332 --> 18:22.068
Got kicked out of Dave's
perfect society for no reason.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.670
Really

18:23.703 --> 18:25.805
Really

18:27.340 --> 18:31.178
I guess I got
a little out of control.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.446
Dave tried to do
something nice for me,

18:33.480 --> 18:35.515
and I completely
screwed it up for him.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.350
So

18:39.219 --> 18:41.020
I know, I know.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.156
Put that judgmental
eyebrow away.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.027
Captain Dave, it's Ronnie.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.529
Come on, open the door.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.631
I'm not leaving
until you talk to me.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.767
Hey, why did you turn on the...?

18:56.035 --> 18:58.738
-Saw that coming.
-Not cool.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.479
I bet you've got
five apples now.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.649
Indeed, but I do feel
kind of dirty.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.951
-That's what happens when you
dance the day shift.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.620
But if it makes you feel better,

19:13.653 --> 19:15.488
I'm really happy
I came to your class,

19:15.522 --> 19:17.357
even if it meant
turning down that guy

19:17.390 --> 19:20.293
who offered me a grand to sit
by his pool and eat a hamburger.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.230
But, hey, I guess $1,000 is
my opportunity cost, right?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.831
Wait! What did you just say?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.033
Oh, some short guys
pay pretty girls to...

19:27.066 --> 19:28.635
No, no, the other thing.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.404
That is the perfect example
of opportunity cost.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.206
Did you learn that
from my class?

19:33.240 --> 19:34.541
Yeah. I'm thinking

19:34.574 --> 19:36.709
about taking an economics class
next semester.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.245
Good for you, Nichole.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.313
And I'm glad
I got through to one person,

19:40.347 --> 19:42.081
even though
she's not my student.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.650
And another positive thing--

19:43.683 --> 19:47.354
those moves I taught you can be
used outside the classroom.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.755
Okay. Like in the hallway?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.223
Like in the bedroom.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.824
I don't teach a class
in the bedroom.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.360
Oh, my God,
are you serious right now?

19:55.462 --> 19:58.365
-We're not here.
-But we are.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.035
Come on, Dave. Let me in!

20:07.607 --> 20:08.775
Hello.

20:08.808 --> 20:12.445
So, uh... how's Lot B?

20:12.479 --> 20:14.614
Well, we replanted the garden,

20:14.647 --> 20:17.284
and Hillary Eileen says the vibe
is back up to "bueno,"

20:17.317 --> 20:18.685
so that's something.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.219
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.589
I didn't mean
for any of that to happen.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.257
I just wasn't thinking.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.259
I get it, Ronnie.
You spend half your life

20:26.293 --> 20:29.429
confined to a 500 square foot
tube, breathing recycled air.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.864
So you want to spend
that other half running naked

20:31.898 --> 20:35.535
through the streets, screaming,
"I am alive."

20:35.568 --> 20:38.471
Yeah. That sounds kind of right.

20:38.505 --> 20:40.172
Hey, Alan, do you mind if I...?

20:44.844 --> 20:47.380
When I was a young pilot,
on my days off,

20:47.414 --> 20:48.815
I used to go to restaurants

20:48.848 --> 20:51.551
and send back perfectly-prepared
food just to feel.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.454
I had a massive cocaine problem.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.489
So, how did you get over that?

20:56.523 --> 20:59.125
The trick is to give yourself
just a little taste sometimes

20:59.158 --> 21:00.393
to keep the demons away.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.162
No. You learn your limits.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.331
You find a balance.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.299
So, you're saying I grow up.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.067
No, you're saying it.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.837
Which is better.
And as your mentor...

21:10.870 --> 21:14.073
Today, in this
very specific situation,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.075
I'll give it to you.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.910
You're welcome back
at Parking Lot B.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.313
We had a vote, and unanimously
invited you back.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.681
Well, not unanimous.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.683
Craig abstained
because he's still missing.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.918
Thank you, Dave.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.688
But if I really want to change,

21:28.721 --> 21:30.890
I know where I need to go.

21:32.892 --> 21:36.729
Before you say anything,
I brought my own kimono.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.999
That's a barbecue grill cover.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.802
But at least you're trying.
Get in.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.137
Where's the red door?

21:45.171 --> 21:47.474
What red door, Ronnie?

21:51.511 --> 21:53.480
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:55.415 --> 21:57.517
You've hit the jackpot
with LA to Vegas.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.919
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.890
911. What's your emergency?

22:03.923 --> 22:06.526
MAN :
I'm on Flight 46,
and we're going down.

22:06.559 --> 22:09.328
Just tell my wife
I'm so sorry that I cannot
come home to you.

22:09.362 --> 22:10.397
Hello?

22:12.532 --> 22:15.502
This is your family.
We got you, okay?

22:17.169 --> 22:18.304
Rapid response now!

22:18.337 --> 22:21.240
-We can't save everyone.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.510
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.
