00:01.436 --> 00:01.653
.

00:01.697 --> 00:03.699
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.742 --> 00:05.135
sexually based offenses

00:05.179 --> 00:06.658
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.704
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.747 --> 00:10.575
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.619 --> 00:12.229
are members of an elite squad

00:12.273 --> 00:14.014
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.233
These are their stories.

00:17.669 --> 00:20.150
- No, I wasn't aware--

00:20.194 --> 00:22.065
I mean,
I'm not surprised.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.067
He certainly deserves it.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.939
It's long overdue.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.245
Yeah, well, thank you--

00:28.289 --> 00:30.943
Thank you
for telling me!

00:30.987 --> 00:33.555
Bye.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.346
Fin.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.228
Can you close the door?

00:56.404 --> 00:57.622
So...

00:57.666 --> 00:59.537
You weren't gonna tell me.
You're just...

00:59.581 --> 01:01.887
not gonna show up one day?
- It's not like that.

01:01.931 --> 01:05.021
I have to hear from Dodds?

01:05.065 --> 01:07.197
- He always had
a big mouth.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.330
- I- I thought
we were like family here.

01:09.373 --> 01:12.811
I mean...

01:12.855 --> 01:16.076
You know, Fin,
on days when...

01:16.119 --> 01:18.121
A perp walks
or a victim dies,

01:18.165 --> 01:19.731
you know, I look

01:19.775 --> 01:21.124
at your desk.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.300
And it reminds me
that there is a cop

01:23.344 --> 01:25.563
who will kick in doors,
and...

01:25.607 --> 01:29.828
Give everything he has
without hesitation, and--

01:29.872 --> 01:32.048
I don't have
to look behind me,

01:32.092 --> 01:34.137
because I know...

01:34.181 --> 01:37.053
That he has my back.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.360
And now--

01:39.403 --> 01:43.625
Now he's Sergeant Tutuola.

01:43.668 --> 01:46.802
- I just didn't want to make a
big thing out of it, you know?

01:48.282 --> 01:50.501
- Gotta start somewhere.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.332
- I'm really happy for you.

01:55.376 --> 01:58.292
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:58.335 --> 02:01.251
- And don't think you're
getting away without a party.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.734
- Sergeant.

02:12.741 --> 02:15.091
- To make us happy.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.137
- I think I'm happy.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.182
- That means a lot
to me, Pam.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.924
Maybe next week we can--
- See more flowers.

02:21.967 --> 02:25.101
Whatever you want.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.147
- "Beauty is truth,
truth, beauty.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.149
"That is all
ye know on Earth,

02:29.192 --> 02:30.933
and all ye
need to know."

02:30.976 --> 02:34.632
You used to say that
all the time, remember?

02:34.676 --> 02:36.982
- It wasn't me, Pam.
That was Dad.

02:39.376 --> 02:42.031
- We should probably
get you back to Bayview.

02:42.074 --> 02:44.729
Dr. Cosgrove
will think I stole you.

02:44.773 --> 02:46.644
- Well, no more flowers.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.733

Thursday is knitting day.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.428
- Today's Friday, honey.

05:35.378 --> 05:38.120
- One of the soap operas
had a storyline about ghosts,

05:38.163 --> 05:40.427
and for weeks,
Madeline was convinced

05:40.470 --> 05:42.211
there was a ghost

05:42.254 --> 05:43.821
I thought we were better

- Right, you did--you did right
to call us, Doctor.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.478
- This is her room.
You have some visitors, Maddie.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.785
I'll be in my office.
- Hi, Maddie.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.483
I'm Detective Rollins.
This is Detective Carisi--

05:53.527 --> 05:56.399

She's been talking about it

06:00.360 --> 06:01.665
all afternoon.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.406
I'm Christine Ritchie,
her daughter.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.278
- Grandma says
you have to be careful.

06:06.322 --> 06:08.672
Too much almond meal
gives it a bite.

06:08.716 --> 06:11.414

- Okay.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.720
Maddie, you--

06:12.763 --> 06:16.811
You told your nurse
that you were raped.

- That's why
they're here, Mom.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.468

Well, I should get dressed.

- Come on, Mom.
Come on.

07:19.047 --> 07:21.266
- Doc, I'm gonna need
a list of all your employees.

07:21.310 --> 07:22.529
- They've all been screened.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.661
- Eh, still,
I'm gonna need that list.

07:24.705 --> 07:25.836
- Fine.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.534
- What about visitors
to your facility?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.405
- Patients' families, mostly.
I can get you those records

07:29.449 --> 07:31.407
and footage
from our security cameras.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.409
- You videotape
your patients' rooms?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.758
- Of course not.
They're sick.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.891
They're still entitled
to a modicum of privacy.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.719
We film the common areas.

07:38.762 --> 07:41.504
If you're asking
my medical opinion,

07:41.548 --> 07:42.549
it's all in her head.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.072
- Maybe.
But still,

07:44.115 --> 07:45.726
I'm gonna need to talk
to all your employees,

07:45.769 --> 07:47.945
just to be sure.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.035
- I just thought
she was getting old.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.689
Forgetful, you know?

07:52.733 --> 07:54.256
Maybe I could have
done something.

07:54.299 --> 07:55.562
Maybe I could have
caught it earlier,

07:55.605 --> 07:57.259
if I'd just called some--
- Christine...

07:57.302 --> 08:00.088
I don't think
it works that way.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.742
- I found Esconso Gardens.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.134
It's the best facility
in the city.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.789
- You're a good daughter.

08:05.833 --> 08:09.793
Do I do it for her
or do I do it for me?

08:10.577 --> 08:15.277
She's my mom.
I feel like I shoved her

08:15.320 --> 08:17.235
into an $18,000-a-month
garbage heap,

08:17.279 --> 08:18.846
just so I wouldn't have
to deal with her.

08:18.889 --> 08:22.153
- You don't know how to
handle someone with dementia.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.546
- I could have learned,
I-I--

08:23.590 --> 08:26.027
I could have hired someone.

08:27.463 --> 08:29.291
She changed my dirty diapers.

08:29.334 --> 08:31.249
The least
I could have done was--

08:31.293 --> 08:32.599
Then maybe
this wouldn't have happened.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.514
- Well, we don't know yet
that it did.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.603
- Hey.
- Christine,

08:36.646 --> 08:38.430
this is my lieutenant,
Olivia Benson.

08:38.474 --> 08:41.608
- I'm so very sorry, Christine.
- Thank you.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.523
I guess it bothers me more
than it does my mom.

08:43.566 --> 08:46.613
- Well, you know, when a--
when a woman is raped,

08:46.656 --> 08:49.659
unfortunately,
she's not the only victim.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.967
It affects everyone
who's close to her.

08:53.010 --> 08:56.361
Look, has your mother
ever complained

08:56.405 --> 08:58.886
about being mistreated
at the facility?

08:58.929 --> 09:02.977
- She said she didn't like
the members of this club.

09:03.020 --> 09:06.328
The help was great, though.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.330
If I didn't laugh,
I'd go crazy.

09:11.899 --> 09:12.987
- Confused.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.597
But my guess,
not raped.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.207
- Oh, thank God.
- I still have to wait

09:16.251 --> 09:17.557
for the lab tests,
to be sure.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.517
- Of course.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.608
- Not that you would expect
if she were raped.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.958
No vaginal trauma,
nothing on her shoulders,

09:28.002 --> 09:30.091
her inner thighs,
her arms, her neck.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.310
No evidence of semen.

09:32.354 --> 09:34.486
I doubt we'll find
any DNA but hers.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.792
- Great, can you put
a rush on that?

09:35.836 --> 09:39.622
- Sure.
- Thank you.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.493
- It's all right, Mom,
it's okay.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.452
No!

09:43.495 --> 09:45.193
- Excuse us.
- Uh--

09:45.236 --> 09:46.673
When will the results be back?

09:46.716 --> 09:49.371
- Not sure just yet,
but as soon as we hear anything

09:49.414 --> 09:51.025
we'll let you know.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.679

What's a hottie like you

10:39.769 --> 10:42.642
- I'm trying to get an answer
to my question.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.687
- I sang a couple tunes.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.081
I had a tuna on rye.
And then I split.

10:47.124 --> 10:49.431

any of the patients' rooms?

10:53.522 --> 10:55.263
Oh, that is sick.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.699
I mean,
these are my people!

If I did anything like that,
I couldn't pay my rent!

came back.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.711
Negative for both
foreign DNA and lubricant.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.626
Also the security cameras
at Esconso

11:10.670 --> 11:12.280
show that the only two people
that went in and out

11:12.323 --> 11:15.109
of Madeline's room all day
were two female nurses.

11:15.152 --> 11:17.067

11:18.373 --> 11:19.417
Okay.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.028

11:24.553 --> 11:26.120
- I haven't gone anywhere yet.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.774
- Well, Fin, you know,
I think she's just pissed

11:27.817 --> 11:29.340
because you didn't
invite her to your party.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.778
- There was no party!
And there will be no party.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.694
- Fin, you're getting promoted,
not arrested.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.870
- I need to talk
to Detective Rollins.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.436
Is she here?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.917
- I got this.

11:40.961 --> 11:43.615
Christine, what's wrong?
- It's my mom.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.356
When we got to her room
last night,

11:45.400 --> 11:47.576
she started shaking
and crying.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.012
They had to sedate her.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.362
I slept on a rollaway
just so she wouldn't be alone.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.625
She kept waking up
and sweating,

11:53.669 --> 11:55.758
and screaming,
"Please stop!"

11:55.802 --> 11:57.412
I didn't know
what to believe before.

11:57.455 --> 12:00.371
But now, I--

12:00.415 --> 12:03.287
Something happened to her,
Detective.

12:03.331 --> 12:06.682
- Okay.
Okay.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.337
- Mom, you're not eating.
You want something else?

12:09.380 --> 12:12.122
- Daddy doesn't want him.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.777
But I love him.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.562
I'm gonna call him Pepper.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.260
- Her dog,
when she was a little girl.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.696
- Don't touch me!

12:20.740 --> 12:21.871
- It's okay.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.571
- I don't want you to.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.356
Leave me alone.
- It's okay, Mom.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.184
No one is gonna hurt you.
It's all right.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.707
- I have a big order,

12:31.751 --> 12:33.361
a-a Cupid's Day party.

12:33.404 --> 12:36.538
- Yes, she used to own
a bakery, called Café Roma.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.105
She did all the baking herself.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.585
- A cake,
and six dozen cookies

12:40.629 --> 12:42.283
by noon!

12:42.326 --> 12:44.024
- Get off me.
- Mom!

12:44.067 --> 12:45.721
Mom, it's okay,
calm down.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.161
- Everybody loved them.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.380
I have--to--

12:52.423 --> 12:55.122
Leave me alone!

12:55.165 --> 12:57.689
- Mom--it's all right, Mom!
It's okay!

12:57.733 --> 12:59.996
- I said no, Max!

13:00.040 --> 13:01.650
- Give me the knife, Mom.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.043
- I have no idea!

13:03.086 --> 13:04.784
- It's okay,
baby, okay?

13:04.827 --> 13:06.176
Should get some rest now,
all right?

13:06.220 --> 13:08.352
Let's go to your room.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.527
- Okay, let's go.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.965
- She's never like this!

13:12.008 --> 13:13.662
Could the rape kit be wrong?

13:13.705 --> 13:15.446
- Well, she wasn't
raped yesterday.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.884
I-I don't know what
or when.

13:17.927 --> 13:20.712
But, yeah, something
definitely happened to her,

13:20.756 --> 13:22.323
maybe at the bakery.
- But she's--she's--

13:22.366 --> 13:24.455
She sold it five years ago!
- Well, luckily,

13:24.499 --> 13:28.459
there's no statute of
limitations on forcible rape.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.679
- Oh, my God.

13:30.722 --> 13:33.813
- We just need to find out
who Max is.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.036
- Boss,
these are detectives.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.169
They have some questions
about Maddie.

13:42.212 --> 13:43.866
- She's, you know,

13:43.910 --> 13:45.389
in the hospital, so.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.261
- I heard she got Alzheimer's.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.219
I read somewhere
that 10% of the country

13:49.263 --> 13:51.004
is gonna have it
in a couple of decades.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.440
- Do you remember
a guy named Max

13:52.483 --> 13:54.094
ever working with Maddie?

13:54.137 --> 13:55.269
No.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.358
For years,
it was just me and her.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.750
I was like her apprentice.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.535
Started in high school.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.319
Then there was Gus.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.930
He moved to Florida.

14:03.973 --> 14:07.063
Wendy,
and her cousin Sue.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.456
Nah, no--

14:08.499 --> 14:09.892
No Max that I can recall.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.111
- Okay.
- It was a long shot.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.461
Thank you for your time.
- Thanks.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.897
- Wait, hey!
Uh--

14:14.941 --> 14:17.813
Maybe you mean Maxwell!

14:17.857 --> 14:20.033
- Yeah, maybe.
What was

14:20.076 --> 14:22.339
- Professor Leonard Maxwell.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.037
Maddie called him Max.

14:24.080 --> 14:27.083
He used to come in here
every day after his classes.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.172
He'd sit at that table
reading a book,

14:29.216 --> 14:31.958
nursing a cappuccino
and a cookie for hours.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.960
He helped me
with my math homework

14:34.003 --> 14:35.570
when I was at Hunter.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.964
One day,
he just stopped coming in.

17:16.861 --> 17:20.604
why you stopped going

Maddie was working late,
getting ready for, uh,

17:33.530 --> 17:35.271
Cupid's Day!

I saw she was still there.

17:41.277 --> 17:44.324
I went in, said hello.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.936
We had a cappuccino.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.373
And then...

17:57.293 --> 17:59.817
Did you rape her,
Leonard?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.259
- We made love.

18:06.302 --> 18:10.132
In the kitchen!

18:10.176 --> 18:14.049
It was beautiful.

18:14.093 --> 18:18.575
But Maddie felt so guilty,
she--

18:18.619 --> 18:21.883
She said we shouldn't
see each other again.

18:26.844 --> 18:31.327
And that was it.

18:31.371 --> 18:35.679
I never saw Maddie again.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.250
Or coffee?
- No.

18:42.599 --> 18:44.862
I'd--I'd like to just
sit here a minute,

18:44.906 --> 18:48.649
if you wouldn't mind.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.226
- Well, Jesse's got a teddy
bear more threatening than him.

19:00.269 --> 19:03.316
- We don't know what
he was like 50 years ago.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.796
- Well, if he didn't rape her,

19:05.840 --> 19:06.928
I'll marry him.

19:06.971 --> 19:11.498
- Let's see what happens
if she sees him.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.461
- This is crazy.
He's 83!

19:18.505 --> 19:19.810
Something like this
could give him a stroke.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.334
- Are you his lawyer
or his doctor?

19:21.377 --> 19:22.770
- His grandson.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.381
- Buy the Harley.
- That's my brother.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.296
- This should be quick,
Maddie.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.691
Just remember
what I told you to do.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.434
- You're gonna--
you're gonna tell me

19:34.477 --> 19:37.437
if you recognize anyone.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.048
- Oh. The man who raped me.

19:40.091 --> 19:43.051
- Right, right.
You're gonna do fine.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.619
- Just look carefully, Maddie.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.935
- They're old!

19:57.979 --> 19:59.372
- Yes, they are.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.635
But, Maddie,
look at their faces.

20:01.678 --> 20:04.812
And try to picture them
as younger men.

20:04.855 --> 20:05.987
- Oh, come on.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.510
This is kabuki.

20:07.554 --> 20:10.339
Even if she picked him out,
it wouldn't stand up in court.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.138
- Okay.

20:27.182 --> 20:29.271
You can take him home.

20:29.315 --> 20:32.709
- Come on,
it's okay.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.588
- I think I left them
on the table.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.590
- It's all right.
I'll take care of it.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.854
- My grandfather
left his glasses.

20:46.897 --> 20:50.031
- Follow me.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.386
- Maddie!

20:57.430 --> 21:01.999
Maddie!
It's me, Leonard!

21:02.043 --> 21:04.001
- I don't know you.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.354
- Okay, let's see
what we can do

21:08.397 --> 21:11.139
about those glasses.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.229
- Mrs. Schecter says

21:14.273 --> 21:16.579
we shouldn't talk to strangers.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.756
- Come on.

21:24.065 --> 21:24.239
.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.720
- I respect your request
not to do anything,

21:26.763 --> 21:28.199
but I thought I'd at least
help you pack.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.332
- I'll pass--I've seen
your organizational skills.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.116
- Fin, I told you,
my apartment doesn't always

21:32.160 --> 21:34.293
look like that.
- Don't worry, I travel light.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.859
- Well, when it rains.
We got another rape

21:35.903 --> 21:38.514
in a convalescent home.
- Wow, weirdos.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.342
There's a lot of that
going around.

21:41.691 --> 21:44.303
- No, a state facility,
downtown.

21:48.089 --> 21:50.004
- She said
it happened last night.

21:50.047 --> 21:51.788
- She didn't report it

21:51.832 --> 21:52.963

The police are here.

21:59.492 --> 22:01.189

22:05.149 --> 22:08.414

or Mrs. Connolly?

22:10.372 --> 22:12.548
- Mrs. Connolly,
I know this is...

22:12.592 --> 22:13.854
This is hard,
but we're just here

22:13.897 --> 22:16.422
to find out what happened.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.730
- I was in my chair.

22:20.774 --> 22:23.733
I love to look outside.

22:23.777 --> 22:25.822
He picked me up, and...

22:25.866 --> 22:27.737
He put me on the bed, and...

22:27.781 --> 22:31.437
Said that he wanted
to massage my feet.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.831
And I--
I felt grateful.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.488
And then he told me
that he

22:39.532 --> 22:42.622
wanted me to love him back.

22:42.665 --> 22:44.406
I...

22:44.450 --> 22:47.931
I was petrified.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.933
I said to him,

22:49.977 --> 22:53.110
"I can't love you
the way you want me to."

22:55.983 --> 22:57.767
- He got mad!

22:57.811 --> 23:01.292
He--he told me
to be quiet.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.425
He told me
that I would like it.

23:03.469 --> 23:04.774
And that I--

23:04.818 --> 23:06.776
I would love him.

23:06.820 --> 23:07.908
And then...

23:07.951 --> 23:11.302
Then he lifted up my...

23:11.346 --> 23:12.521
Robe.

23:12.565 --> 23:14.958
And he rubbed

23:15.002 --> 23:18.614
coconut oil
on the back of my legs.

23:18.658 --> 23:21.312
And...

23:21.356 --> 23:23.489
He got undressed.

23:23.532 --> 23:25.447
And he...

23:25.491 --> 23:29.016
Climbed on top of me.

23:30.670 --> 23:33.281
And he raped me.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.631
He raped me!

23:35.675 --> 23:38.808
And he was saying,

23:38.852 --> 23:41.463
"I-I love you.
I love you."

23:41.507 --> 23:45.902
And he wanted me to say
that I love him too,

23:45.946 --> 23:49.036
but I-I just couldn't.
I couldn't say it!

23:49.079 --> 23:51.821
- I'm so sorry
that this has happened.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.519
Okay?
But you're safe now.

23:53.562 --> 23:57.087
You're gonna be okay.
- No, I'm not!

23:57.131 --> 23:59.655
It's never gonna be okay!

24:03.050 --> 24:07.141
I married
my Ben when I was 18.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.839
There's never been
another man.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.841
I--

24:11.885 --> 24:15.105
I didn't even fight.
I didn't--

24:15.149 --> 24:19.109
I didn't even scream.
I didn't do any of that!

24:20.546 --> 24:23.723
You survived.
That's what's important.

24:28.554 --> 24:29.816
- It was Dan.

24:29.859 --> 24:32.296
He was new here.

24:37.911 --> 24:40.391
- Here it is:
Daniel Hammerson,

24:40.435 --> 24:42.524
331 Jane Street,
in the Village.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.222
He's only been with us
two weeks; he was a temp.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.529
We have a lot of turnover.
- EMS is on the way here.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.400
They're gonna take Patrice
to the hospital for a rape kit.

24:49.444 --> 24:52.229
If anything happens,
call me, okay?

24:52.273 --> 24:54.231
- You know no one
has even been to visit her?

24:54.275 --> 24:55.668
- Lesson to be learned:
In the end,

24:55.711 --> 24:58.279
nobody gives a damn.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.587
- You wanna talk to Dan.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.677
My husband.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.897
- Well, hasn't moved.

25:07.941 --> 25:10.421
Ask him anything you want.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.075
- Uh, apologies.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.555
When was it
that he passed away?

25:13.599 --> 25:15.514
- On the calendar,
it's been about a year.

25:15.557 --> 25:19.735
But Danny had dementia.
He was gone from me years ago.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.044
- Sunny Acres,
in Hell's Kitchen.

25:24.087 --> 25:25.915
But there wasn't
any acres.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.917
Or sun.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.223
- The creep
who raped Patrice

25:29.266 --> 25:31.268
used the ID
of a patient who died

25:31.312 --> 25:33.009
in another old-age home.

25:33.053 --> 25:34.576
- Yeah, he moved
from Sunny Acres

25:34.620 --> 25:36.099
to a hospice in Queens.
They gave him a great rec.

25:36.143 --> 25:37.536
He just kept moving
from place to place.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.102
- I ran his picture
through facial recognition,

25:39.146 --> 25:40.147
nothing.
- And he worked

25:40.190 --> 25:41.409
at Maddie Thomas' place?

25:41.452 --> 25:42.976
Yes, he did.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.543
He was a real
renaissance man, this guy.

25:44.586 --> 25:47.415
He was a nurse, a orderly,
a chef, and a rapist.

25:47.458 --> 25:48.938
- He's a temp,
filled in where needed.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.897
- Okay, what did he do at
Esconso Gardens?

25:50.940 --> 25:54.030
- Worked in the kitchen.
- Well, that's interesting.

25:54.074 --> 25:56.293
- The marzipan cookies.
- The smell!

25:56.337 --> 25:59.514
It must have brought her back
50 years, to the bakery.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.429
- And then she conflated
a one-night-stand

26:01.472 --> 26:03.300
with Maxwell in '66
with Nurse Dan's rape.

26:03.344 --> 26:06.303
- Look, somebody
at one of these facilities

26:06.347 --> 26:09.524
has got to know
something about him.

26:12.832 --> 26:13.963
- He worked a shift with you.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.835
- These temps,
they cycle in and out.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.140
It's hard to keep track.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.142
He whistled a lot,
made me crazy.

26:19.186 --> 26:21.144
- It wasn't reggae.

26:21.188 --> 26:22.755
- He seemed very friendly.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.365
Polite.

26:24.408 --> 26:26.454
- No.
- How about what--

26:26.497 --> 26:28.151
what train he took
to get home?

26:28.195 --> 26:30.501
- He didn't really
speak that much.

26:30.545 --> 26:31.807
- What about when
he answered his cell?

26:31.851 --> 26:33.113
Did he always
call himself Dan?

26:33.156 --> 26:34.593
- Actually,
I don't recall him

26:34.636 --> 26:36.290
getting any phone calls.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.508
- Thank you.
- Hey.

26:37.552 --> 26:38.858
I got nothing.
- Yeah.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.861
Just back to Esconso Gardens.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.166
- His name is Dan.
He worked

26:43.210 --> 26:45.299
in the kitchen with you?
- Not exactly.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.822
We made the food.
He delivered it

26:46.866 --> 26:50.434
to the residents.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.828
- If they're not up for meeting
in the main hall, yes.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.264
Also a snack
before bedtime.

26:54.308 --> 26:55.483
- Is there anything
that he said

26:55.526 --> 26:57.441
that might tell us
who he really is?

26:57.485 --> 26:58.791
- He wasn't a big talker.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.531
Always whistling
or humming.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.142
Show tunes,
believe it or not.

27:02.185 --> 27:04.144
And not like
from "Hamilton," old ones.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.536
- Such as...

27:05.580 --> 27:07.626
- The stuff
Trudy Morris sang?

27:07.669 --> 27:09.671
He said he knew her.

27:09.715 --> 27:13.327
- Thank you.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.809
Trudy Morris,
I'm Detective Rollins.

27:16.852 --> 27:18.245
This is Detective Carisi.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.681
- I'm far too busy.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.161
- Don't worry, Ms. Morris,
we're not here

27:21.204 --> 27:22.379
for an autograph.
- Well, that's good,

27:22.423 --> 27:25.382
because I stopped
signing them in '85.

27:25.426 --> 27:27.950
And I'm not going
to sing for you, either.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.691
- Understood.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.041
- I was just about to have
a glass of pinot,

27:32.085 --> 27:34.043
if you care to join me.
- We're good.

27:34.087 --> 27:35.175
We're, uh--
we're actually looking

27:35.218 --> 27:38.308
for a friend of yours.

27:38.352 --> 27:40.180
- He's not a friend!

27:40.223 --> 27:41.660
- He says he knows you.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.705
- That's my son, Henry.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.968
What an unfortunate angle.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.491
You caught his bad side.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.624
He's really
a very handsome young man.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.061
That's us,
in front of the Belasco.

27:52.105 --> 27:53.715
- He's not in the picture.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.761
- And me, backstage,

27:55.804 --> 27:56.892
at Shakespeare in the Park.

27:56.936 --> 27:58.894
"As You Like It."

27:58.938 --> 28:01.854
I was a very
exuberant Rosalind.

28:01.897 --> 28:05.031
It's Will's best
female role, you know?

28:05.074 --> 28:07.207
"Oh, how full of briars

28:07.250 --> 28:08.948
is this working day world."

28:10.253 --> 28:12.299
We really need
to speak with Henry.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.822
- Well, then sit.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.519
Have a glass of pinot.
He'll be back in a minute.

28:15.563 --> 28:18.131
- Thanks, but we're working.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.654
Well, why should that stop you?

28:19.698 --> 28:21.351
The Barrymores
watered the family tree

28:21.395 --> 28:22.526
with Irish whiskey!

28:22.570 --> 28:24.050
- Oh, you know.
Rules.

28:24.093 --> 28:25.573
- Aww, you're cute,

28:25.616 --> 28:29.098
in a very prosaic
sort of way.

28:29.142 --> 28:32.754
That was meant only
in the best way.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.110
They said the green dress
will be ready tomorrow.

28:41.154 --> 28:44.113
Well, I need it today.

28:44.157 --> 28:47.551
Just like his father.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.423
- You don't have
any plans today,

28:49.466 --> 28:51.120
unless you're keeping
something from me.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.643
I'm so sorry, I--
I didn't know

28:52.687 --> 28:54.645
that you had company.

28:54.689 --> 28:56.473
- Phillips, uh--
Mom, what's going on?

28:56.517 --> 28:57.648
- Henry Phillips,
turn around.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.999
You're under arrest.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.740
- This is ridiculous!

29:01.783 --> 29:03.829
- Ma'am.

29:03.872 --> 29:06.788
- Plenty.
- Ow!

29:14.796 --> 29:15.014
.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.755
- So Esconso,
Silverwald,

29:16.798 --> 29:18.408
and, uh, Sunny Acres.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.584
Come on.
What's the matter, Henry?

29:20.628 --> 29:22.021
Can't keep a job?

29:22.064 --> 29:23.805
- I'm restless.
What can I say?

29:23.849 --> 29:25.938
- And invisible.

29:29.115 --> 29:31.726
One of
your dead patients' names.

29:31.770 --> 29:35.121
- Because of
my mother's career.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.514
- Your mother's retired.

29:37.558 --> 29:40.604
You clearly don't understand
the effect celebrity has

29:40.648 --> 29:41.910
on regular people.

29:41.954 --> 29:44.652
If I use my real name,
it's non-stop.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.480
"What's your mom like?"
Or, or--

29:46.523 --> 29:48.264
"I saw her in blah-blah."

29:48.308 --> 29:49.613
Or, the worst:

29:49.657 --> 29:51.441
"Can I meet her?"

29:51.485 --> 29:53.095
Every conversation's about her.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.836
- I thought you used
your dad's name?

29:54.880 --> 29:57.230
- There's something
called "Google."

29:57.273 --> 29:58.405
You should try it.

29:58.448 --> 29:59.667
- All right, yeah, sure.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.103
People are Googling you.

30:01.147 --> 30:03.627
Or maybe,
and let's just try this on...

30:03.671 --> 30:04.933
Maybe it's the fact
that you like

30:04.977 --> 30:06.805
to rape old ladies.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.372
- That's a lie.

30:09.416 --> 30:10.852
- That's interesting.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.636
Most people,
if they were accused

30:12.680 --> 30:13.986
of something like that,
they would say,

30:14.029 --> 30:16.510
"That's sick,"
or, "Disgusting."

30:16.553 --> 30:18.512
- I'm not most people.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.557
- No, of course you're not.
You're special.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.255
You're Trudy Morris'
baby boy.

30:22.298 --> 30:25.040
And you're telling me that you
never used that on a woman?

30:25.084 --> 30:26.563
"Come on in,
come meet my mom.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.957
Maybe we screw--"
- That is sick.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.003
- Well, it's gotta work better
than "Henry Phillips."

30:31.046 --> 30:32.743
- Unless your dad's
a big-shot, too.

30:32.787 --> 30:34.658
I've had four.

30:34.702 --> 30:37.313
- That must have been tough.

30:37.357 --> 30:39.402
Angling for
your mother's attention.

30:39.446 --> 30:41.013
- No, it was great, actually.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.841
Whenever I got tired of one,

30:42.884 --> 30:44.320
Mom simply moved on
to the next.

30:44.364 --> 30:46.453
- Oh, so your mother
managed her love life

30:46.496 --> 30:48.847
based on your whims?

30:51.284 --> 30:53.503
- She's a good mother.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.506
We're very close.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.465
Simpatico.

30:58.508 --> 30:59.509
We have a...

30:59.553 --> 31:02.773
Similar attention span.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.908
- Okay, Henry.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.476
Tell us about
Patrice Conolly.

31:09.519 --> 31:10.825
- Hmm.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.871
Nice lady.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.437
She had problems
with her feet,

31:14.481 --> 31:15.917
so I rubbed them for her.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.353
She liked that.

31:17.397 --> 31:19.355
- She says you did
more than that.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.271
Oh.

31:22.315 --> 31:26.362
Maybe she's living out
some weirdo sexual fantasy.

31:26.406 --> 31:29.148
Older women are attracted to
me, nothing I can do about it.

31:29.191 --> 31:30.714
- We'll know soon enough,

31:30.758 --> 31:33.761
once the rape kit
comes back from the lab.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.721
- I should talk
to a lawyer.

31:40.246 --> 31:42.726
- I have my own counsel,
thank you.

31:42.770 --> 31:46.034
- Great.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.956
- Hey, Sarge.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.349
- Rub it in,
why don't you?

31:56.392 --> 31:59.047
- Come on,
you're gonna get used to it.

31:59.091 --> 32:01.397
- I doubt it, Liv.
If I wanted to push paper,

32:01.441 --> 32:02.659
I'd sell insurance.

32:02.703 --> 32:03.834
- Come on,
it's not gonna last forever.

32:03.878 --> 32:04.966
- Tomorrow's too long.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.968
- You know that
my hands were tied

32:07.012 --> 32:08.404
on this one, right?
- Yeah.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.754
I dug my hole,
I'll eat the dirt.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.456
- Hey, Carisi.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.068
Oh.

32:20.112 --> 32:24.072
Okay, I'm on--
I'm on my way.

32:24.116 --> 32:25.682
Uh--

32:25.726 --> 32:29.034
My rape victim died, so...

32:29.077 --> 32:31.732
I gotta go.
- Go be a cop!

32:31.775 --> 32:34.909
Somebody gotta do it.

32:43.831 --> 32:46.616
- The doctor said
it was a coronary.

32:46.660 --> 32:49.141
- You sound skeptical.

32:49.184 --> 32:53.319
- Patrice was faithful to
her one true love for 50 years.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.147
So maybe you can die
of a broken heart.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.627
- They found his DNA,

32:57.671 --> 32:59.107
but without
Patrice's testimony,

32:59.151 --> 33:00.935
that freak will claim
it was consensual.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.197
And he's gonna
get away with it.

33:02.241 --> 33:05.679
- Not if we charge him
with two rapes.

33:05.722 --> 33:07.028
- You talking about
Madeline Thomas?

33:07.072 --> 33:10.118
- There's still a chance
that she can ID him.

33:12.164 --> 33:15.254
So, Madeline,
I'm gonna show you some photos

33:15.297 --> 33:16.951
in connection to the rape
you reported.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.431
Is that okay?

33:18.474 --> 33:19.258
- Mm-hmm.

33:19.301 --> 33:20.999
- Okay.
And you--

33:21.042 --> 33:22.565
You just let me know if you--

33:22.609 --> 33:24.698
if you recognize anyone.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.482
- That's what friends do!

33:26.526 --> 33:29.442
Okay.

33:29.485 --> 33:32.184
Do you recognize him?

33:38.320 --> 33:39.147
- Well,

33:39.191 --> 33:41.715
remember when you told me

33:41.758 --> 33:44.152
that someone
brought you cookies?

33:44.196 --> 33:46.285
We think that
we may have found

33:46.328 --> 33:48.417
the man that hurt you,
and I just--

33:48.461 --> 33:50.985
I just need to know
if this is him.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.770
- Oh, no,
he doesn't like cookies.

33:53.814 --> 33:55.294
Okay.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.861
Okay, so,
what about him?

33:57.905 --> 34:00.951
- You have such nice hands.

34:00.995 --> 34:02.866
- Thank you!
- Uh, Mom,

34:02.910 --> 34:04.085
can you look
at this picture?

34:04.129 --> 34:05.608
Do you know that man?

34:06.740 --> 34:09.047
Oh, I love you so much.

34:09.090 --> 34:12.485
- That's so sweet, Mom.

34:12.528 --> 34:15.183
I love you too.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.490
- Okay,
what about this man,

34:17.533 --> 34:18.621
do you remember him?

34:18.665 --> 34:23.365
Do you recognize him?

34:23.409 --> 34:24.888
The cookies!

34:24.932 --> 34:26.934
- Did he--

34:26.977 --> 34:28.196
Did he bring you cookies?

34:28.240 --> 34:29.545
Madeline, did he hurt you?

34:34.942 --> 34:37.640
- It's okay.

34:37.684 --> 34:40.556
It's okay, shh.

34:42.471 --> 34:45.039
It's okay, Mom.

34:48.912 --> 34:49.087
.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.088
- It's a long shot.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.394
- It's better than
no shot at all.

34:52.438 --> 34:53.482
- I would object
if opposing counsel

34:53.526 --> 34:54.614
tried to put her
on the stand.

34:54.657 --> 34:55.876
- And I understand that, but--

34:55.919 --> 34:57.486
but these women,
nobody has any need

34:57.530 --> 34:59.488
for them anymore.
Their--their--

34:59.532 --> 35:02.274
"sell-by" dates have expired.

35:02.317 --> 35:03.840
All right,
we can't just--

35:03.884 --> 35:05.799
leave them out on the curb
for Wednesday pick-up.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.627
So what do we do?
We shove them into hospitals,

35:07.670 --> 35:09.672
we shove them in facilities,

35:09.716 --> 35:12.371
and give them old records
and coloring books.

35:12.414 --> 35:13.633
- Show them the flowers.

35:13.676 --> 35:15.417
- The least that we can do

35:15.461 --> 35:17.985
is keep predators out
of their beds.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.029
- Stop.

35:19.073 --> 35:20.596
You win.

35:20.640 --> 35:24.078
Let's just hope we get
a judge who loves his mother.

35:26.385 --> 35:27.690
- She's been institutionalized

35:27.734 --> 35:29.475
for over five years,
Your Honor.

35:29.518 --> 35:31.303
- She has moments
of lucidity.

35:31.346 --> 35:32.608
- She's the
complaining witness.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.306
Moments aren't good enough.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.872
- She's ill, Your Honor.
That doesn't mean

35:35.916 --> 35:38.005
she forfeits the rights
afforded all citizens.

35:38.048 --> 35:39.833
- Let's go to the source.

35:39.876 --> 35:42.444
Hello, Miss.
I'm Judge Peck.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.533
Can you tell me
your name, please?

35:44.577 --> 35:46.448
- Madeline Jane Thomas.

35:46.492 --> 35:47.884
You can call me Maddie.

35:47.928 --> 35:50.670
- Thank you, Maddie.
When's your birthday?

35:50.713 --> 35:53.238
- October 4, 1935.

35:53.281 --> 35:54.587
- And do you know
where you are?

35:54.630 --> 35:58.591
I'm in a courthouse!

35:58.634 --> 36:00.201
Of course I do,
Howard,

36:00.245 --> 36:03.770
I would love to marry you.

36:03.813 --> 36:06.729
- That's beautiful.
- So are chrysanthemums!

36:06.773 --> 36:08.470
White ones, especially.

36:08.514 --> 36:11.256
- Yes, they are pretty.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.171
- The law should be stable,

36:13.214 --> 36:14.955
but must not stand still.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.913
- She's obviously
been prepped, Judge.

36:16.957 --> 36:19.438
Nobody quotes Roscoe Pound
off the top of her head.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.744
- She's not quoting,
she's reading.

36:21.788 --> 36:24.660
- "When in the course
of human events--"

36:24.704 --> 36:26.488
- That's very good, Maddie.

36:26.532 --> 36:27.750
- Thank you, Howard.

36:27.794 --> 36:28.577
Oh!

36:28.621 --> 36:30.666
"Today's specials:

36:30.710 --> 36:33.756
"Corned Beef and Cabbage,
$17.50;

36:33.800 --> 36:35.932
"Tuna melt, $9.50;

36:35.976 --> 36:38.761
Spaghetti and meatballs,
$10.75--"

36:38.805 --> 36:41.416
- I renew my motion to preclude
this witness from testifying.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.896
- Motion is granted.

36:42.939 --> 36:44.767
- In that case,
I move to dismiss the case

36:44.811 --> 36:46.508
against Henry Phillips
in its entirety.

36:46.552 --> 36:48.380
- I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.643
Case dismissed.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.605
- I'm sorry.

36:56.649 --> 36:59.042
He gets away with it?

36:59.086 --> 37:02.089
- It is not
over yet, Christine.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.657
- Come on, Mom.

37:07.703 --> 37:11.229
- No hope is better
than false hope.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.013
Henry's last name
certainly didn't have the draw

37:13.056 --> 37:15.015
I thought it would.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.583
- I don't see any press here,
clamoring for a scoop.

37:17.626 --> 37:20.542
Seems like they'd like
this kind of thing.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.332
- Well, no,
not yet, Jenna.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.681
We've got to give it time.

37:28.724 --> 37:31.379
No, no, no,
it is perfect.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.468
Okay, thank you.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.688
Bye.

37:39.561 --> 37:42.260
You were right,
there's more.

37:46.525 --> 37:48.483
- James, this is
Lieutenant Benson.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.703
- Yes, that's me.

37:50.746 --> 37:52.400
- It happened
to my mom, too.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.184
She's 87.
She's in a nursing home

37:54.228 --> 37:56.491
on the Upper East Side.
I showed her this photo.

37:56.535 --> 37:57.884
She started crying.

37:57.927 --> 37:59.755
She said,
"That's him."

37:59.799 --> 38:01.844
Six months ago,
she told me something happened,

38:01.888 --> 38:04.194
but I didn't
take her seriously.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.109
- Hey.

38:06.153 --> 38:10.592
We got another one.

38:10.636 --> 38:13.247
- Arrest the son of a bitch.

38:19.079 --> 38:20.341
- Not again.

38:20.385 --> 38:22.212
- If we're lucky,
this will be the last time.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.345
- I don't appreciate
your sarcasm.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.825
- I'm not being sarcastic.

38:25.868 --> 38:27.522
We've got evidence
that your son has raped

38:27.566 --> 38:29.045
at least four women.
- And I bet

38:29.089 --> 38:30.569
that number doubles
by the end of the week.

38:30.612 --> 38:32.397
- Because of
that salacious article.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.224
- Mother, it's all lies!

38:34.268 --> 38:35.748
- Well, we've got witnesses
who disagree.

38:35.791 --> 38:37.706
- Don't you see
what's going on here?

38:37.750 --> 38:39.882
The cockroaches are coming
out of the woodwork,

38:39.926 --> 38:42.102
just so they can have
their brief moment

38:42.145 --> 38:44.060
in the spotlight.
Do they care

38:44.104 --> 38:45.714
that they're dragging me
through the mud?

38:45.758 --> 38:47.499
- It's me that's being
libeled here, Mother.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.631
Your father

38:49.675 --> 38:54.549
was a fame whore,
and so are you.

38:54.593 --> 38:57.291
- And Phil
and Jack.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.249
And Spencer.

38:59.293 --> 39:01.382
- Clingers,
every one of them.

39:01.426 --> 39:04.254
- But you keep on
bringing them into your bed.

39:04.298 --> 39:07.127
Sweating and stinking up
your thousand dollar sheets,

39:07.170 --> 39:08.998
while I...

39:09.042 --> 39:12.872
Who is the real whore
here, Mother?

39:12.915 --> 39:14.700
They all just used you and--

39:14.743 --> 39:17.137
and tossed you out,
like last week's pot roast.

39:17.180 --> 39:20.096

39:20.140 --> 39:22.403
They didn't see!

39:22.447 --> 39:24.753
But I did.

39:24.797 --> 39:28.714
I saw how beautiful you were.

39:28.757 --> 39:29.932
Your hair,

39:29.976 --> 39:31.978

in the morning.

Your skin...

After your bath,
so soft.

39:40.769 --> 39:43.990
I loved you, Mother!

39:44.033 --> 39:46.949
Why couldn't you love me back,
just a little?

39:49.735 --> 39:52.477

You're done.
