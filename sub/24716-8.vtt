00:09.926 --> 00:11.511

and started punching.

around the neighborhood?

00:13.054 --> 00:14.514
No, I've never seen him before.

Lucy Welker is supposed
to testify for me this afternoon

00:28.069 --> 00:29.863
I've seen him around the office.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.574
He told me
that if I testified against Simon...

00:32.824 --> 00:34.325
(SOBBING) ...he'd cut my throat.

00:34.451 --> 00:38.163
-Sir, if I could just explain...
-I received an anonymous allegation

00:38.288 --> 00:41.207
that you were working at McGowan's.
I've confirmed that allegation.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.419
As a result, I've referred the matter
to internal affairs.

It's been a week, Counselor.

we don't believe that is sufficient

06:00.026 --> 06:01.903
Well, I'm curious as to what
Miss Munson's referring to

06:02.070 --> 06:04.447
-as "current circumstances."
-Well, you could start with the fact

06:04.572 --> 06:05.948
that our chief witness was assaulted.

06:06.157 --> 06:09.160
There is absolutely no evidence
linking my client to this alleged assault.

implying anything to the contrary.

06:11.662 --> 06:12.914
Is there any reason that this witness

06:12.997 --> 06:14.749
wouldn't be able to testify
at the second trial?

Miss Munson,

I think your office together with
the New York City Police Department,

06:23.424 --> 06:27.095
should be able to do whatever is necessary
to keep her safe and available.

an application for bail to be set.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.904

06:44.987 --> 06:47.156
My client has been incarcerated
for six months.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.699

does he represent a flight risk.

You're making this application based on
length of pre-trial incarceration?

06:55.540 --> 06:58.876
That's correct, Your Honor.
Mr. Korensky's entitled to a speedy trial.

with wife and children.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.390
He also has significant contacts
in Russia and Israel,

07:12.557 --> 07:14.642

with you there, Miss Munson.

Did he trust you with his plans
to burn down the warehouse?

-What plan?
-What'd you do? Pad the inventory,

would back off in prosecuting this case?

21:31.748 --> 21:34.710
so you and your prosecutor buddy
get to carve another notch in your belt.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.420
Janet that's not really fair.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.046
This guy set a fire that killed a fireman.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.673
You don't think it's important
he's prosecuted?

than you give her credit for.

to tell me what my sister's capable of.

getting yourself worked up.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.647
He saved my life this morning,

21:55.772 --> 21:58.025
and I will not have you speak
to him like that.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.737
I'm sorry, perhaps you'd prefer
I didn't involve myself.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.197
Yes, I would.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.535
Fine. I guess you prefer
the company of policemen

22:08.702 --> 22:10.245
-to that of your sister.
-(SIGHS)

22:10.370 --> 22:12.414

-In any event, you're here with them.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.583
I'm sure you'll be perfectly safe.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.589
Why don't you take a few minutes?

22:23.091 --> 22:24.176
Don't be mad at her.

22:24.259 --> 22:25.802
No, she's worried about you.
I understand that.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.889
(SIGHS) It's just that it's all on me.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.683
I know you're there,
and I know Miss Munson's there,

22:31.767 --> 22:34.728
but sitting up there
on that witness stand,

22:35.228 --> 22:37.856
I feel like it's just me.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.859
Lucy, let's get a coffee. Come on.

22:46.698 --> 22:47.699
LUCY: Thank you.

like you're alone in this,

22:50.577 --> 22:52.287
but you know that I care about you.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.206
-You know that I'm here to protect you.
-LUCY: Yes.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.458
You can't keep doing what you're doing.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.337
-What am I doing?
-Carrying secrets around with you.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.798
(STAMMERS) You're telling part truth,

23:02.923 --> 23:04.758
part lies, and hoping that
no one will find out

23:04.883 --> 23:07.094
what you don't want them to find out,
it's too much of a burden.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.720
What choice do I have?

23:09.763 --> 23:11.932
This morning, in Munson's office
you mentioned Ike Korensky,

23:12.099 --> 23:14.434
and then you pulled back
like you wished you hadn't mentioned him.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.229
Well, I wasn't aware of doing that.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.482
And then when you ran into him
on the stairs, you got so upset

23:20.649 --> 23:21.900
that you needed to see a doctor.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.444
That had nothing to do
with running into him.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.823
It was just a buildup
of everything that's been going on.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.450
-What was Ike's involvement, Lucy?
-Oh.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.244
Was he in on starting the fire?

23:32.452 --> 23:35.414
He did everything he could
to talk Sy out of it.

23:36.289 --> 23:39.042
He told him there were other ways
to come up with the money.

23:39.167 --> 23:42.379
He offered to sell his own home.
It didn't matter.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.257
When he saw that Sy was going
through with it,

23:45.674 --> 23:47.551
all he could do was go down
to the warehouse

23:47.676 --> 23:49.052
and give the guard the night off.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.513
-How do you know all this?
-Because Ike told me.

23:51.638 --> 23:54.182
-Why would he tell you?
-Because he trusted me.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.143
(SIGHS)

23:57.436 --> 23:59.104
And because we were lovers.

24:00.856 --> 24:05.068
He wasn't leaving his wife.
I knew he wasn't leaving his wife.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.822
I just loved him. (CHUCKLES)

24:10.157 --> 24:11.366
I still love him.

Normally, I got a lot of regard
for you guys, but this is nuts.

24:55.952 --> 24:57.704
How come you sent
the guard home that night, Ike?

24:57.871 --> 25:00.373
IKE: I sent him home
because there was nothing for him to do.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.168
I think that his daughter was up
from Florida then.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.587
You do realize it comes off
a little suspicious

25:05.754 --> 25:08.131
when you, all of a sudden,
send the night watchman home

25:08.256 --> 25:09.925
the same night the place burns down?

Wolfe is my sister-in-law's father.
He couldn't guard a bowl of dog food.

he was earning a few dollars.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.517
Ike, you discussed the plan ahead of time
with your brother.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.268
You went to the warehouse
the night of the fire.

25:20.435 --> 25:23.438
Believe me when I tell you,
there's 12 people in your future

25:23.563 --> 25:25.232
who are gonna send you to prison for that.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.150
How do you know what I discussed
with my brother?

25:27.275 --> 25:28.568
Lucy Welker told us.

25:28.777 --> 25:32.155
And when she takes the stand
the next time, she's gonna testify to it.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.282
And to how it is she knows.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.826
-She told you?
-JOHN: You should hang your head in shame

25:36.952 --> 25:38.620
that you let a scared-to-death woman

25:38.828 --> 25:41.790
that you supposedly care for,
put her life on the line

25:41.915 --> 25:45.168
because she's the only one willing
to stand up against your scumbag brother.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.461
I can't believe she told you.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.755
She stood the beating
without saying anything,

25:48.838 --> 25:50.840
but getting shot at was a little more
than she could handle.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.175

25:52.300 --> 25:54.886
Doesn't matter what you wanted.
You did it to her.

I had coffee with my girlfriend,

to Continental Avenue.

I was getting a ride into the city
is all I was doing.

to stop off and kill somebody,

33:31.926 --> 33:33.136

I grab a handful of fake Rolexes

33:40.268 --> 33:43.229
off some wink's table on Canal Street,
and I sell them for 15 dollars a piece.

33:43.354 --> 33:46.232
Well, then congratulations,
you've just broken into the big leagues.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.735
What you're looking at
is conspiracy to commit murder

33:48.860 --> 33:50.737
and attempted murder on a police officer.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.197
That'll send you away
for 25 years minimum.

33:53.322 --> 33:55.491
On the other hand,
it'll look a lot more impressive in prison

-than grabbing a handful of fake Rolexes.
-BUTCHIE: Wait a minute.

be terminated.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.736
-There is no basis for this, Your Honor.
-The basis is that either Detective Jones

35:13.820 --> 35:15.738
is actively concealing
Michael's whereabouts

35:15.822 --> 35:17.490
because he's afraid
he's not gonna like the outcome

35:17.573 --> 35:19.033
of these proceedings, or he's negligent.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.828

The boy's not here, I'm not gonna proceed

And so what I would suggest,
is that everyone lend their best efforts

35:32.421 --> 35:34.590
to finding him and bringing him in.

35:37.844 --> 35:38.928
