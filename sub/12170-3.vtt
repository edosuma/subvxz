01:02.000 --> 01:07.370
Despondency breaks off its course.

01:07.430 --> 01:11.270
Anguish breaks off its course.

01:11.330 --> 01:16.930
The vulture breaks off its flight.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.270
The eager light streams out.

01:22.330 --> 01:26.100
Even the ghosts take a draft.

01:30.830 --> 01:34.230
And our paintings see daylight.

01:37.730 --> 01:41.970
Our red beasts of the ice age studios.

01:42.030 --> 01:44.720
Everything begins to look around.

01:44.770 --> 01:49.100
We walk in the sun in hundreds.

01:49.170 --> 01:54.200
Each man is a half-open door,
leading to a room for everyone.

02:06.230 --> 02:11.230
The water is shining among the trees.

02:11.300 --> 02:14.500
The lake is a window into the earth.

02:18.500 --> 02:24.870
♪ Tram wires cross northern skies ♪

02:24.930 --> 02:33.200
♪ Cut my blue heart in two ♪

02:33.270 --> 02:40.470
♪ My knuckles bleed down
the tattered street ♪

02:40.530 --> 02:47.870
♪ On a door that shouldn't
be in front of me ♪

02:55.430 --> 03:01.430
There's a noticeable difference.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.280
Because you're relatively young,

03:04.330 --> 03:06.420
because you're reasonably healthy,

03:06.470 --> 03:09.930
it is likely to take hold more quickly.

03:11.470 --> 03:12.920
How long?

03:12.970 --> 03:15.440
That's difficult to say.

03:18.700 --> 03:25.370
There will be moments of disorientation

03:25.430 --> 03:30.100
and possibly some more acute episodes.

03:30.170 --> 03:36.800
But it is time to start
making some adjustments, Kurt.

03:36.870 --> 03:40.330
It's time to tell people.

04:16.029 --> 04:20.829
Hi Linda, I spoke to...

04:20.899 --> 04:24.970
Linda, I spoke to the doctor, and, uh...

04:25.030 --> 04:26.680
I spoke to the doctor.

04:26.730 --> 04:28.020
I had to, um...

04:28.070 --> 04:31.600
I had to...

04:31.670 --> 04:34.900
I got a call from the, um...

04:37.200 --> 04:39.120
I had to speak...

04:39.170 --> 04:42.200
I wanted to just give you a chat...

05:41.750 --> 05:42.750
What is it?

05:42.800 --> 05:43.850
Have you got a minute?

05:43.900 --> 05:45.120
Yeah, yeah.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.840
Come on in.

05:47.550 --> 05:48.550
What's up?

05:48.600 --> 05:49.380
Um...

05:49.430 --> 05:50.380
Hang on.

05:50.430 --> 05:51.750
What's up, what's up?

05:51.800 --> 05:53.420
Hans's dad's gone missing.

05:53.470 --> 05:54.380
When?

05:54.430 --> 05:55.420
What happened?

05:55.470 --> 05:57.220
Sunday morning.

05:57.270 --> 05:59.880
Haåkon got up for his walk...

05:59.930 --> 06:01.750
... and left the house
before Louise got up.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.480
She heard him go, but he didn't come back.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.420
What time?

06:04.470 --> 06:05.280
6:00 a.m.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.280
He does it every day.

06:06.330 --> 06:07.320
And where does he walk?

06:07.370 --> 06:08.880
Sit down, sit down, come on.

06:08.930 --> 06:11.450
Past the lake, into the woods.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.250
The back of their place.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.880
It's a kilometer and a
half there and back.

06:15.930 --> 06:17.920
And has Louise told the police?

06:17.970 --> 06:19.180
Yeah, they've looked.

06:19.230 --> 06:23.130
I mean, I suppose whatever
the usual search is, but...

06:23.200 --> 06:25.120
Has Hans gone up?

06:25.170 --> 06:27.750
No, she told him not to drop
everything if he was busy,

06:27.800 --> 06:30.800
but he's upset, Dad, he's worried.

06:31.770 --> 06:33.720
Most people don't stay lost.

06:33.770 --> 06:37.130
90-odd percent of them
come back by themselves.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.530
Can you go up, Dad?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.680
See if you can help?

06:41.730 --> 06:43.230
Sure.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.050
Sure, I'll give Louise a call.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.250
Thanks.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.020
But I'm suspended, though.

06:47.070 --> 06:49.410
I can't arrest anyone.

06:53.930 --> 06:55.680
I'm sure it'll be fine.

06:55.730 --> 06:57.120
You tell Hans that.

06:57.170 --> 06:59.970
Tell him his dad will be fine.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.540
I love you, Dad.

07:10.770 --> 07:12.440
I love you.

07:16.530 --> 07:19.730
Why don't you go and pick up Klara?

07:19.800 --> 07:20.950
It'll be fine, sweetheart.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.480
Thank you.

07:22.530 --> 07:23.800
Bye.

08:18.680 --> 08:19.680
Oh, hello.

08:19.730 --> 08:20.680
Hello, Mr. Wallander.

08:20.730 --> 08:21.580
I can take your bag.

08:21.630 --> 08:22.520
Oh, I can...

08:22.570 --> 08:23.480
I can take it.

08:23.530 --> 08:24.320
Thanks.

08:24.370 --> 08:25.970
Thank you.

08:36.669 --> 08:38.070
Louise?

08:38.900 --> 08:41.100
Oh!

08:41.169 --> 08:43.270
Oh, Kurt.

08:43.330 --> 08:46.200
I thought it might have been...

08:46.670 --> 08:49.250
There's a policeman down over the lake.

08:49.300 --> 08:50.280
Ytterberg.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.530
I've told him you're coming.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.340
How are you?

08:55.970 --> 08:58.950
This is so kind of you, but really, I'm...

08:59.000 --> 09:02.770
Please don't worry about me.

09:04.430 --> 09:07.000
We'll find him, Louise.

09:09.370 --> 09:10.640
Yes.

09:13.530 --> 09:16.100
And no sign?

09:16.170 --> 09:17.450
Thanks.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.100
Wallander?

09:21.580 --> 09:22.580
Ytterberg.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.980
Good to meet you.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.500
They're calling it a day.

09:34.230 --> 09:37.080
The Navy sent a team to dredge the lake.

09:37.130 --> 09:38.580
He's not in the forest.

09:38.630 --> 09:40.380
The dogs couldn't find him.

09:40.430 --> 09:42.770
He's not in the water.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.130
His wife doesn't think he has any enemies.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.970
What do you think?

09:50.030 --> 09:51.630
Suicide?

09:51.700 --> 09:53.240
Accident?

09:56.800 --> 10:00.430
Be my guest if you want to look into it.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.820
We're not a big station.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.810
Another mind on this would be...

10:07.030 --> 10:09.570
Here's my card.

10:09.630 --> 10:12.330
Thanks, um...

10:12.380 --> 10:13.380
Sorry.

10:13.430 --> 10:15.020
Let me know if you find anything.

10:15.070 --> 10:17.170
Of course.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.520
You're fine, you're fine.

10:41.570 --> 10:43.310
You're 55...

10:44.700 --> 10:47.070
56...

10:47.130 --> 10:53.570
57, 58, 59, 60, 61.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.080
Come on, you're fine, you're fine.

10:57.130 --> 10:59.330
55, 56...

11:14.420 --> 11:15.420
Good morning, Louise.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.680
Are you a breakfast person?

11:17.730 --> 11:19.280
I'm diabetic.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.270
You're not fat.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.450
Well, I was wondering

11:24.500 --> 11:27.630
if Haåkon would have kept
the cards from his birthday.

11:27.680 --> 11:28.350
Does he usually do that?

11:28.400 --> 11:30.530
Oh, I doubt that.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.670
Now, what does a diabetic eat?

11:33.730 --> 11:36.620
Just some fruit, some cereal, or...

11:36.670 --> 11:37.680
Oh.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.820
You don't have to, it's fine, it's fine.

11:39.870 --> 11:42.010
Just help yourself.

11:42.170 --> 11:43.850
Haåkon's friend Sten called.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.320
He's waiting to hear from you.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.820
And, uh, there's his address.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.940
Okay, uh, sorry...

11:52.270 --> 11:55.570
Do you like Klara's kindergarten?

11:55.630 --> 11:58.470
Yeah, the teachers seem nice.

11:58.530 --> 12:00.850
Doesn't Linda want to stay at home?

12:00.900 --> 12:03.020
Or doesn't Hans earn enough?

12:03.070 --> 12:05.930
It's not a matter of, um...

12:08.500 --> 12:10.280
You know what, I'll
make this call, if I may.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.730
Thanks.

12:36.370 --> 12:37.970
Excuse me.

12:38.730 --> 12:40.280
Excuse me, Sten Norlander?

12:40.330 --> 12:42.570
Yeah.

12:42.630 --> 12:43.880
Wallander?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.550
Yeah, I think Louise
said to give you a call.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.320
Yeah, she did.

12:47.370 --> 12:48.320
Linda's dad.

12:48.370 --> 12:48.920
Right.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.320
Yeah, I can see it.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.450
Never met her, but...

12:52.500 --> 12:56.330
So, you weren't at
Haåkon's birthday party.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.550
My sister was sick.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.880
Plus it's not my kind of thing, so...

13:01.930 --> 13:04.180
Was there anything on his mind recently?

13:04.230 --> 13:07.500
Anything troubling him?

13:07.570 --> 13:10.080
Would you say he was depressed?

13:10.130 --> 13:11.080
Yeah.

13:11.130 --> 13:14.130
Like about 60% of the population.

13:15.900 --> 13:18.500
I mean, he was a brooder.

13:18.570 --> 13:21.150
All this stuff just lately --

13:21.200 --> 13:24.970
Putin sending subs into Swedish waters,

13:25.030 --> 13:27.380
whether or not we should do anything,

13:27.430 --> 13:32.100
whether or not we identify
them, provoke an incident.

13:32.170 --> 13:34.720
It'll have brought it all back again.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.680
The submarine incursions from the '80s?

13:37.730 --> 13:40.520
Pretty much torpedoed the both of us.

13:40.570 --> 13:41.250
You think somebody's killed him?

13:41.300 --> 13:44.900
Why would somebody kill him?

13:44.970 --> 13:47.430
They wouldn't.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.370
He didn't kill himself, though.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.550
You want to come out?

13:53.600 --> 13:56.370
No, thank you.

14:02.900 --> 14:07.530
Can you remember the last
thing that he said to you?

14:07.600 --> 14:09.800
I don't know.

14:09.870 --> 14:12.380
Probably something about boats.

14:12.430 --> 14:15.830
Not much else to talk about.

14:15.900 --> 14:20.600
I don't think either of us
have ever done much else.

14:51.430 --> 14:52.550
Wallander.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.720
Hi Kurt, it's Lennart.

14:53.770 --> 14:55.520
Are you all ready for tomorrow?

14:55.570 --> 14:57.270
Sorry?

14:57.330 --> 15:00.200
The internal affairs interview.

15:00.270 --> 15:01.480
Uh, yeah.

15:01.530 --> 15:02.480
Yeah, no, fine.

15:02.530 --> 15:03.680
You'll be there, right?

15:03.730 --> 15:05.020
Yeah, 10:00 a.m., Kurt.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.680
All right, okay.

15:06.730 --> 15:07.780
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:07.830 --> 15:09.100
Okay.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.050
Bugger.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.500
Bugger, bugger, bugger.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.600
10:00 a.m.

16:20.070 --> 16:23.430
Did you discuss the submarine incursions?

16:23.500 --> 16:24.850
The idea that the government

16:24.900 --> 16:28.400
had purposely let the
Russian submarines go?

16:28.470 --> 16:31.830
They did purposely let them go.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.250
We were out on the archipelago.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.520
We were scrambled.

16:34.570 --> 16:35.750
You know this.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.420
It was all on the news.

16:37.470 --> 16:39.250
It went all the way to the prime minister.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.420
You think the prime minister...

16:41.470 --> 16:43.120
I thought...

16:43.170 --> 16:44.420
I'm so sorry.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.900
I just found a...

16:46.970 --> 16:48.470
Sorry.

16:50.630 --> 16:55.370
Do you know where he
used to play billiards?

16:55.430 --> 16:57.970
He doesn't play billiards.

16:59.370 --> 17:01.320
Just it's the only other
thing in the diary.

17:01.370 --> 17:03.500
He doesn't play.

17:03.570 --> 17:05.770
He's dead, isn't he?

17:06.530 --> 17:09.400
What the hell's been the point?

17:13.470 --> 17:14.480
Louise?

17:14.530 --> 17:16.530
Good night, Kurt.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.480
Why don't you call Hans and Linda, or...?

17:47.530 --> 17:48.950
I'm a sailor's wife.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.520
I'm used to being on my own.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.930
Louise, you don't have to
go through this by yourself.

17:54.980 --> 17:55.680
I'll get them to come up.

17:55.730 --> 17:57.380
I have friends.

17:57.430 --> 17:59.300
I'm all right.

18:01.670 --> 18:03.020
Goodbye, Kurt.

18:03.070 --> 18:05.010
Goodbye, Louise.

18:17.070 --> 18:20.050
Did you discuss the submarine incursions?

18:20.100 --> 18:23.030
The idea that the government

18:23.100 --> 18:25.850
had purposely let the
Russian submarines go?

18:25.900 --> 18:28.620
They did purposely let them go.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.650
We were out on the archipelago.

18:30.700 --> 18:31.480
We were scrambled.

18:31.530 --> 18:32.380
You know this.

18:32.430 --> 18:34.830
It was all on the news.

18:35.130 --> 18:38.170
Did you discuss the submarine incursions?

18:38.230 --> 18:40.850
The idea that the government

18:40.900 --> 18:44.000
had purposely let the
Russian submarines go?

18:44.070 --> 18:45.880
They did purposely let them go.

18:45.930 --> 18:48.800
We were out on the archipelago.

18:48.930 --> 18:50.920
Are you saying the prime minister

18:50.970 --> 18:53.020
ordered you not to mine the submarines?

18:53.070 --> 18:54.980
Yes, that's common knowledge.

18:55.030 --> 18:58.170
Swedish neutrality is a joke.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.670
It always has been.

19:02.570 --> 19:05.570
Did you ever have any reason to believe...

19:13.400 --> 19:15.400
A spy? A traitor?

19:49.370 --> 19:51.170
Okay, thanks.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.130
Sorry, sorry.

19:58.580 --> 19:59.580
You okay?

19:59.630 --> 20:00.620
Yeah.

20:00.670 --> 20:02.140
Come on.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.220
As I said, it was a long day.

20:06.270 --> 20:10.930
I have a pain in the small
of my back when I...

20:11.000 --> 20:13.650
It was uncomfortable to sit there,

20:13.700 --> 20:16.280
so I took it out and put it on the seat.

20:16.330 --> 20:19.630
It was a stupid thing to do.

20:20.870 --> 20:23.070
Shirt, got my shirt.

20:25.930 --> 20:27.400
Shirt...

20:38.500 --> 20:40.570
I've got my shirt.

20:42.870 --> 20:46.900
I've got the shirt, got the shirt.

20:46.970 --> 20:48.840
Got the shirt.

21:11.050 --> 21:12.050
How'd it go?

21:12.100 --> 21:13.970
You all right?

21:14.630 --> 21:15.720
Yeah, yeah.

21:15.770 --> 21:17.550
I'm just, uh...

21:17.600 --> 21:19.730
You okay?

21:24.270 --> 21:26.940
Look, if you need to talk...

21:28.800 --> 21:30.700
No, thanks.

21:33.530 --> 21:34.650
Just, uh...

21:34.700 --> 21:36.970
You have to let it...

21:38.600 --> 21:40.480
Thanks, though.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.150
I'll see you later, yeah?

21:42.200 --> 21:43.870
Yeah, sure.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.730
Swedish neutrality is a joke.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.180
It always has been.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.770
Clearly, it still is.

21:55.830 --> 21:58.450
Did you ever have any reason to believe

21:58.500 --> 22:02.100
that one of the Naval command
may have been unreliable?

22:02.170 --> 22:05.430
HAÅ How do you define that?

22:05.500 --> 22:08.800
How would youdefine it?

22:08.870 --> 22:12.200
A spy? A traitor?

22:21.400 --> 22:22.740
Hello?

22:24.630 --> 22:26.630
Hi, it's just me.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.150
Granddad!

22:31.200 --> 22:32.150
Hello, you!

22:32.200 --> 22:33.320
I've got a scooter!

22:33.370 --> 22:34.320
Wow!

22:34.370 --> 22:35.820
I can ride it myself!

22:35.870 --> 22:37.340
You bet!

22:41.500 --> 22:42.850
Oh, here.

22:42.900 --> 22:44.570
Oh, Christ.

22:46.270 --> 22:48.670
Oh, you look exhausted.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.750
He's got something once a month.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.830
It's every, um...

22:55.900 --> 22:58.520
Every first Friday, as I recall.

22:58.570 --> 22:59.620
Yeah, billiards in the diary.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.280
She says he never played.

23:01.330 --> 23:02.350
What? An affair?

23:02.400 --> 23:03.320
Would you put it in the diary like that?

23:03.370 --> 23:04.450
No, I wouldn't, but...

23:04.500 --> 23:06.280
I was there for two days, and I can't...

23:06.330 --> 23:08.720
I don't think that she
even knows who he is...

23:08.770 --> 23:09.820
No, they're not close.

23:09.870 --> 23:11.320
They function, I think, but...

23:11.370 --> 23:13.120
You know what marriages can be like.

23:13.170 --> 23:15.650
Well, I mean, what exactly did he do?

23:15.700 --> 23:17.280
Submarine commander.

23:17.330 --> 23:19.450
Hans thinks he might have
been in naval intelligence.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.450
Although that's not something you're...

23:22.500 --> 23:23.950
I mean, I don't think...

23:24.000 --> 23:26.520
You keep that secret even
from your family, right?

23:26.570 --> 23:28.280
Maybe that's why Louise is like she is.

23:28.330 --> 23:29.780
It's hard to live with someone

23:29.830 --> 23:33.030
if you know they're keeping secrets.

23:34.930 --> 23:37.930
Klara asked if he was dead today.

23:39.420 --> 23:40.420
Hi!

23:40.470 --> 23:41.480
Oh, hey!

23:41.530 --> 23:42.480
Papa!

23:42.530 --> 23:44.630
Hi, darling!

23:44.700 --> 23:45.950
How are you?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.220
Dad's here.

23:47.270 --> 23:48.180
Oh.

23:48.230 --> 23:50.600
Go and play.

23:54.630 --> 23:56.620
Thanks for going up, Kurt.

23:56.670 --> 23:58.470
How's Louise?

24:01.070 --> 24:03.050
I think she'd be pleased to see you,

24:03.100 --> 24:05.020
whatever she says.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.420
I have a couple more hours to do.

24:06.470 --> 24:08.140
Okay, yeah.

24:09.730 --> 24:11.380
She doesn't want me, Kurt.

24:11.430 --> 24:13.120
And I don't think she wanted you.

24:13.170 --> 24:15.380
No, I asked Dad to go up as a policeman.

24:15.430 --> 24:16.920
- Yes, thanks, I know.
- Hey, come on...

24:16.970 --> 24:17.550
It's fine, it's fine.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.920
It's fine.

24:18.970 --> 24:20.520
Mama, I'm tired.

24:20.570 --> 24:22.600
Uh...

24:22.670 --> 24:25.610
Let's brush your teeth, come on.

24:32.500 --> 24:35.240
I don't think Haåkon is dead.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.540
I think he's left her.

24:41.630 --> 24:42.680
Why would he leave her?

24:42.730 --> 24:44.520
I really need to finish these things off.

24:44.570 --> 24:45.820
Can we just...?

24:45.870 --> 24:46.780
Hans, if you think...

24:46.830 --> 24:49.730
If he's dead, he's dead.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.450
If he's not, he'll come back.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.900
Please.

25:26.530 --> 25:28.000
Come on!

25:36.430 --> 25:38.370
Yeah, Wallander.

25:40.630 --> 25:42.180
Okay, okay.

25:42.230 --> 25:44.230
Come on, come on.

25:45.770 --> 25:47.240
Come on!

25:52.850 --> 25:53.850
Hi.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.150
Steven Wilson.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.280
Haåkon's friend?

25:56.330 --> 25:58.250
I hadn't intended to
turn up without warning,

25:58.300 --> 26:02.270
but I got the time in Copenhagen wrong.

26:02.330 --> 26:04.120
I've been up to visit Louise.

26:04.170 --> 26:04.980
Right.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.080
You got time for a walk?

26:07.130 --> 26:08.350
It's hard to talk to Louise.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.820
Can't get a thing out of her.

26:09.870 --> 26:11.480
You think he had an accident?

26:11.530 --> 26:12.080
We don't know.

26:12.130 --> 26:15.170
He's just gone.

26:15.230 --> 26:17.180
He left a message on my answer service

26:17.230 --> 26:18.380
couple of weeks ago.

26:18.430 --> 26:21.830
I don't check it regularly these days.

26:21.900 --> 26:25.800
Nothing in it to suggest he
was thinking of, you know,

26:25.870 --> 26:27.850
doing something stupid.

26:27.900 --> 26:28.980
Just, "Give me a call."

26:29.030 --> 26:30.920
Didn't seem urgent.

26:30.970 --> 26:33.150
Now, of course, I wonder.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.220
Did he visit you in America?

26:35.270 --> 26:37.750
Every few years, he and Louise.

26:37.800 --> 26:38.820
Once upon a time,

26:38.870 --> 26:42.600
Louise got along very
well with my late wife.

26:42.670 --> 26:45.830
You know Hans is married to my daughter?

26:45.900 --> 26:47.380
I never met Hans.

26:47.430 --> 26:50.700
Was gonna drop by and say hi before I go.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.320
Also the sister.

26:52.370 --> 26:53.280
Sister?

26:53.330 --> 26:54.620
Signe.

26:54.670 --> 26:57.670
I didn't know Haåkon had a sister.

26:58.500 --> 27:01.270
Perhaps I misremember.

27:01.330 --> 27:04.670
I tend to muddle things these days.

27:04.730 --> 27:06.680
Look, um, I better go
if I want to see Hans.

27:06.730 --> 27:08.720
I got a plane to catch.

27:08.770 --> 27:09.680
Can you call if anything...?

27:09.730 --> 27:11.220
If you give me your card.

27:11.270 --> 27:12.540
Sure.

27:16.870 --> 27:19.030
Listen, thank you.

27:19.100 --> 27:20.440
And...

27:22.000 --> 27:23.270
Bye.

27:35.030 --> 27:37.970
Kurt Wallander from Ystad.

27:38.030 --> 27:39.980
I'd like you to help me with
a personal record, please.

27:40.030 --> 27:45.500
The name is Signe Von Enke.

27:45.570 --> 27:56.330
I assume that she is the
sister of Haåkon Von Enke.

27:56.400 --> 28:02.900
Yes, personal number is 400117-5498.

28:02.970 --> 28:06.300
Probably born in the '30s or '40s.

28:20.430 --> 28:22.180
Okay, uh, maybe I have...

28:22.230 --> 28:24.770
What is the date of birth?

28:28.870 --> 28:31.900
1982.

28:31.970 --> 28:34.910
Is there... is there an address?

29:21.030 --> 29:22.620
Can I help you?

29:22.670 --> 29:24.580
I'm looking for Signe Von Enke.

29:24.630 --> 29:26.980
Her brother's married to my daughter.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.980
I didn't know she had a brother.

29:29.030 --> 29:32.570
He doesn't know he has a sister.

29:32.630 --> 29:34.650
Well, it's only ever
her father who visits.

29:34.700 --> 29:35.280
Haåkon.

29:35.330 --> 29:36.350
Regular as clockwork.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.750
The first Friday every month, yes?

29:37.800 --> 29:39.200
Uh-huh.

29:47.070 --> 29:49.130
She's blind.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.180
Severely brain damaged.

29:51.230 --> 29:55.000
She's lived in places
like this her whole life.

29:55.070 --> 29:58.500
What does her father do
when he comes to see her?

29:58.570 --> 30:01.730
He sits with her, reads to her.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.030
Holds her hand.

30:04.100 --> 30:06.020
He was here last on the sixth?

30:06.070 --> 30:07.350
I can check.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.280
Please.

30:08.330 --> 30:09.930
Thank you.

32:02.700 --> 32:05.730
Hello, you have reached Louise Von Enke.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.200
Please leave a message.

32:09.030 --> 32:10.580
Louise, it's Kurt.

32:10.630 --> 32:11.620
I'm on my way over.

32:11.670 --> 32:13.050
I'm not far away.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.750
Could you call give me a
call when you get this?

32:15.800 --> 32:17.200
Thanks.

32:38.750 --> 32:39.750
Can I speak with Louise, please?

32:39.800 --> 32:40.450
I don't know -- she's not here.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.420
It's very unlike her.

32:41.470 --> 32:42.420
She's not answering her phone either.

32:42.470 --> 32:44.180
Yes, I know, I've tried her too.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.150
Her walking shoes are gone.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.800
All right.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.400
Louise!

32:56.670 --> 32:58.100
Louise!

33:03.530 --> 33:04.930
Louise!

35:34.430 --> 35:37.080
I'm going to take them back to Copenhagen.

35:37.130 --> 35:39.870
We'll be back at the weekend.

35:59.470 --> 36:00.880
Why do you think she took her shoes off?

36:00.930 --> 36:02.580
I mean, the soles of
her feet weren't dirty.

36:02.630 --> 36:04.050
How do you hang yourself over a lake

36:04.100 --> 36:06.900
without getting your feet wet?

36:10.070 --> 36:12.080
These were in her coat pocket.

36:12.130 --> 36:14.630
Right, what are they?

36:14.680 --> 36:15.550
It's microfilm.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.280
It's microfilm of naval documents:

36:18.330 --> 36:20.280
plans, movement orders.

36:20.330 --> 36:22.780
They're old -- 30-odd years.

36:22.830 --> 36:26.930
It's the same kind of film the Stasi used.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.280
All right, listen to this.

36:29.330 --> 36:31.380
Did you ever have any reason to believe

36:31.430 --> 36:34.050
that one of the Naval command
may have been unreliable?

36:34.100 --> 36:36.020
HAÅ How do you define that?

36:36.070 --> 36:38.070
A spy? A traitor?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.050
Who's he talking to?

36:43.100 --> 36:45.700
I don't know, I don't know.

36:45.770 --> 36:46.880
Where did you get it?

36:46.930 --> 36:49.280
It was taped under a drawer in his study.

36:49.330 --> 36:52.500
There's no indication of who
he's talking to, or when.

36:52.570 --> 36:54.950
He had a letter, some
sort of news or something,

36:55.000 --> 36:56.120
on his birthday.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.820
It was a card, it was
in with the other cards,

36:57.870 --> 36:59.380
and there was something in it --

36:59.430 --> 37:00.180
a photo, I think.

37:00.230 --> 37:01.320
It really shook him.

37:01.370 --> 37:03.750
Somebody's digging around in the past

37:03.800 --> 37:07.370
from that time into
this alleged espionage.

37:07.430 --> 37:11.930
I thought that it was Haåkon
who was under pressure,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.830
but maybe it was Louise.

37:15.900 --> 37:19.830
Maybe he was suspicious of her.

37:21.570 --> 37:23.250
I mean, what is this?

37:23.300 --> 37:25.480
Is this a suicide note?

37:25.530 --> 37:26.750
A confession?

37:26.800 --> 37:27.980
What's happened to him, then?

37:28.030 --> 37:31.530
I don't know, I don't
know, but it doesn't...

37:33.230 --> 37:35.400
Look.

37:35.470 --> 37:39.270
This all seems very elaborate.

37:39.330 --> 37:40.550
If we suspect foul play,

37:40.600 --> 37:43.120
I'd be inclined to look closer to home.

37:43.170 --> 37:44.280
Meaning...?

37:44.330 --> 37:48.030
Does Hans have financial problems?

37:48.100 --> 37:49.920
He stands to inherit
the property, the money.

37:49.970 --> 37:51.920
He's been dealing with
his parents' finances.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.280
No, no.

37:53.330 --> 37:56.020
I'm just going from past experience.

37:56.070 --> 38:00.170
The truth is often just
staring you in the face.

38:07.130 --> 38:08.600
Come on.

38:33.530 --> 38:35.000
Louise.

38:36.430 --> 38:37.830
Louise.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.470
I, uh...

38:45.730 --> 38:47.800
I found something.

39:00.730 --> 39:02.870
Oh, my goodness me.

39:05.100 --> 39:06.920
What is it all about?

39:06.970 --> 39:08.250
Haårsfjaärden.

39:08.300 --> 39:09.750
Haårsfjaärden?

39:09.800 --> 39:13.500
The submarine incursions.

39:13.570 --> 39:15.320
I knew he was always trying to find out

39:15.370 --> 39:17.620
where the orders were coming from.

39:17.670 --> 39:19.320
I didn't know he was going into it

39:19.370 --> 39:22.330
in so much detail.

39:22.400 --> 39:23.650
Why were the submarines...

39:23.700 --> 39:27.300
Why was the incident so important to him?

39:29.500 --> 39:33.200
The commander wasn't the
only one to be upset.

39:33.270 --> 39:36.220
We all wondered what the hell had gone on.

39:36.270 --> 39:41.130
Ruined a lot of careers,
Soviet subs in Swedish waters.

39:41.200 --> 39:42.420
And, in the end,

39:42.470 --> 39:45.800
we had to let them go
without identifying them.

39:45.870 --> 39:48.250
There were a lot of rumors going around.

39:48.300 --> 39:51.200
Rumors about spies?

39:51.270 --> 39:54.070
Traitors.

39:54.130 --> 39:57.330
A weak link in the chain of command.

40:00.400 --> 40:06.270
So somebody gave a direct order
not to raise the submarines?

40:06.330 --> 40:08.070
Yes.

40:08.130 --> 40:11.270
There was an order to take no action.

40:15.570 --> 40:22.270
Could it have been
Haåkon who decided that?

40:23.600 --> 40:25.530
No!

40:25.600 --> 40:26.950
No, I...

40:27.000 --> 40:30.200
Do you mind taking a look at
the back of the book, please?

40:34.600 --> 40:36.870
Louise.

40:36.930 --> 40:38.870
Yeah, Louise.

40:40.070 --> 40:42.970
So she's in there too.

40:43.030 --> 40:46.400
Do you think that

40:46.470 --> 40:48.480
she could have accessed
confidential information

40:48.530 --> 40:50.670
of his?

40:50.730 --> 40:52.520
Then she could have
passed it on to somebody?

40:52.570 --> 40:57.600
That in some way she was
the bad link in the command?

40:57.670 --> 41:00.020
No, that's totally ridiculous.

41:00.070 --> 41:02.180
I don't think either Haåkon
or Louise committed suicide.

41:02.230 --> 41:03.650
I think there's somebody here now,

41:03.700 --> 41:07.700
and they're covering
up, they're cleaning up.

41:08.430 --> 41:10.450
Haåkon is not a traitor.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.640
Neither was Louise.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.530
Excuse me.

41:19.830 --> 41:21.430
Wallander.

41:35.730 --> 41:40.300
Your son-in-law has received
over three million kronor

41:40.370 --> 41:43.570
from his parents over the past year.

41:45.630 --> 41:47.080
I called him.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.720
He's a hard man to get hold of.

41:49.770 --> 41:51.800
He denied it.

41:51.870 --> 41:55.470
I'm not pointing the finger at anyone.

41:55.530 --> 41:58.750
It's just something I need to clarify.

41:58.800 --> 41:59.520
Hello?

41:59.570 --> 42:00.650
Hi, sweetheart.

42:00.700 --> 42:02.220
Hi Dad, are you okay?

42:02.270 --> 42:03.680
Yeah, can I have a word with Hans, please?

42:03.730 --> 42:06.070
Uh, he's not home.

42:06.130 --> 42:07.150
He's at the office.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.420
Okay, when's he going to be back?

42:08.470 --> 42:10.780
Not until late, I don't
think -- about 10:00.

42:10.830 --> 42:12.350
Is everything all right?

42:12.400 --> 42:14.120
What's going on?

42:14.170 --> 42:16.650
Have you found out anything about his dad?

42:16.700 --> 42:18.670
No, no, no, no.

42:18.720 --> 42:19.320
There are a couple of...

42:19.370 --> 42:20.380
It's silly...

42:20.430 --> 42:21.220
Are you all right?

42:21.270 --> 42:24.170
Yeah, I'm not doing anything.

42:24.230 --> 42:25.580
I'm absolutely fine.

42:25.630 --> 42:26.680
Sorry to bother you.

42:26.730 --> 42:27.920
I'll talk to you later, yeah?

42:27.970 --> 42:29.050
All right, I love you, Dad.

42:29.100 --> 42:29.850
Bye.

42:29.900 --> 42:31.840
All right, bye.

43:19.270 --> 43:20.750
No, I need to see...

43:20.800 --> 43:25.970
I need to see Hans Von Enke
as soon as possible, okay?

43:26.030 --> 43:27.870
Hans?

43:27.930 --> 43:29.200
Hans!

43:29.270 --> 43:31.210
I'll do my best.

43:42.630 --> 43:43.720
Kurt, you can't just...

43:43.770 --> 43:44.950
How long have you been
stealing their money?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.520
How long have you been
stealing their money, Hans?

43:47.570 --> 43:48.620
- I haven't...
- You have!

43:48.670 --> 43:50.320
You have, Hans.

43:50.370 --> 43:51.450
I've read the statements.

43:51.500 --> 43:52.450
You lied.

43:52.500 --> 43:53.080
You lied to Ytterberg about it.

43:53.130 --> 43:54.150
You don't do that.

43:54.200 --> 43:56.050
You don't do that, you don't do that.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.250
You've been taking money.

43:57.300 --> 43:58.350
You have been taking
money from your parents.

43:58.400 --> 44:00.480
You've been taking money
from your parents.

44:00.530 --> 44:01.480
Three million.

44:01.530 --> 44:02.220
Three million from your parents.

44:02.270 --> 44:03.220
I haven't been taking it.

44:03.270 --> 44:04.220
- No?
- No!

44:04.270 --> 44:04.880
What have you been doing, then?

44:04.930 --> 44:05.880
I...

44:05.930 --> 44:06.520
What have you been doing, then?

44:06.570 --> 44:07.320
You've been lying!

44:07.370 --> 44:11.030
They've been giving it to me.

44:11.080 --> 44:11.580
I've borrowed it.

44:11.630 --> 44:13.370
Borrowed it?

44:17.370 --> 44:19.840
I haven't been taking it.

44:24.130 --> 44:26.480
Don't tell Linda, please.

44:26.530 --> 44:28.520
I'm not going to keep
anything back from...

44:28.570 --> 44:29.580
I mean, what else have you
been hiding from my sister?

44:29.630 --> 44:32.170
Hm? Eh?

44:32.230 --> 44:34.470
Did you?

44:34.530 --> 44:36.670
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

44:39.400 --> 44:41.580
Did you kill your parents?

44:41.630 --> 44:43.170
What?

44:43.230 --> 44:44.280
I...

44:44.330 --> 44:47.530
I was here all the time.

44:47.600 --> 44:49.540
For God's sake.

44:52.430 --> 44:55.700
The only thing I'm ever trying to do

44:55.770 --> 44:58.900
is just provide for my
wife and my daughter.

45:01.470 --> 45:03.320
That's all I think of, Kurt.

45:03.370 --> 45:06.000
That's all I ever think of.

45:11.970 --> 45:13.220
I'm sorry, Hans.

45:13.270 --> 45:13.980
I don't really...

45:14.030 --> 45:15.970
I haven't got...

45:26.870 --> 45:28.230
Kurt?

45:36.330 --> 45:37.350
Uh, we'll...

45:37.400 --> 45:39.000
See you...

46:27.300 --> 46:28.700
Haåkon?

46:40.130 --> 46:41.530
Haåkon?

46:47.430 --> 46:48.830
Haåkon!

47:02.730 --> 47:04.130
Haåkon?

47:05.930 --> 47:07.330
Haåkon!

47:24.700 --> 47:26.100
Haåkon?

48:12.470 --> 48:13.870
Haåkon!

49:00.830 --> 49:02.100
Dad?

49:06.070 --> 49:07.410
Jussi.

49:35.830 --> 49:37.100
Dad?

50:04.730 --> 50:06.000
Dad?

50:08.600 --> 50:09.720
Dad?

50:09.770 --> 50:10.880
Dad, Dad...

50:10.930 --> 50:12.400
What...?

50:15.830 --> 50:17.330
Dad!

50:17.400 --> 50:18.780
No, I can't, I've got to be able...

50:18.830 --> 50:19.720
It's okay.

50:19.770 --> 50:20.780
No, no!

50:20.830 --> 50:22.180
Take the taxi!

50:22.230 --> 50:23.720
Got to take the taxi!

50:23.770 --> 50:25.500
Dad, Dad!

50:25.570 --> 50:28.170
Come on, give it!

50:28.230 --> 50:29.500
Stop!

50:34.700 --> 50:35.820
Dad!

50:35.870 --> 50:37.600
Dad, stop!

50:44.600 --> 50:45.870
Eh?!

50:52.730 --> 50:54.000
Okay.

51:31.300 --> 51:33.500
Are you my daughter?

51:40.330 --> 51:41.930
Yes.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.600
I'm Linda.

51:49.200 --> 51:51.270
Dad, Dad, come on.

51:52.030 --> 51:54.700
Come on, let's get you home.

51:56.530 --> 51:58.670
Let's get you home.

52:02.930 --> 52:04.770
Linda, yeah?

52:04.830 --> 52:06.100
Yeah.

52:07.430 --> 52:09.570
Let's get you back.

52:16.980 --> 52:17.980
Come here.

52:18.030 --> 52:19.050
Come on, come on.

52:19.100 --> 52:21.770
Come on, let's get you home.

52:33.430 --> 52:35.880
What did the doctor say?

52:35.930 --> 52:38.300
They can't really say.

52:38.370 --> 52:41.530
Five years, six, seven years, maybe.

52:44.500 --> 52:48.170
What was I doing seven years ago?

52:48.230 --> 52:50.870
Drinking red wine.

52:50.930 --> 52:53.830
Falling asleep in your chair.

52:53.900 --> 52:55.720
I was looking after Granddad.

52:55.770 --> 53:00.130
Me and your mom had just got divorced.

53:00.200 --> 53:04.770
I saw this 15-year-old girl

53:04.830 --> 53:08.670
set herself on fire in a rape field.

53:08.730 --> 53:12.730
That's something I could
do with forgetting.

53:15.030 --> 53:16.970
What's it like?

53:19.470 --> 53:20.580
I can't really...

53:20.630 --> 53:22.880
I don't know, it's all...

53:22.930 --> 53:26.100
It's all sorts of different things.

53:26.170 --> 53:30.670
Sometimes I find that I can't...

53:30.730 --> 53:35.170
I can't even imagine
where I'm supposed to be.

53:35.230 --> 53:37.930
You kind of hit a wall.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.870
You know, you try and go
through it, you can't, so...

53:42.930 --> 53:44.050
You try and get over it,

53:44.100 --> 53:48.700
try and go around it
some other way, but...

53:48.770 --> 53:52.470
You get, uh...

53:52.530 --> 53:55.270
You get so anxious.

53:55.330 --> 53:59.600
You get anxious, you get angry.

53:59.670 --> 54:04.970
And then I just try and think back

54:05.030 --> 54:06.380
to, you know, things I know have happened.

54:06.430 --> 54:07.620
I think I put things...

54:07.670 --> 54:09.280
I know they must have happened.

54:09.330 --> 54:12.400
And it's just the, uh...

54:16.970 --> 54:17.980
It's just the pictures,

54:18.030 --> 54:21.030
the pictures aren't there anymore.

54:22.770 --> 54:25.420
It's like suddenly a lot of things,

54:25.470 --> 54:28.300
it's like they're dissolving.

54:31.700 --> 54:33.680
Why didn't you tell me?

54:33.730 --> 54:35.800
I'm your daughter.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.600
Because you're my daughter.

54:48.370 --> 54:50.650
Because you have a daughter of your own.

54:50.700 --> 54:54.930
Because I'm the son of a
father who had this, and...

55:01.370 --> 55:03.570
Well, let me decide.

55:07.170 --> 55:11.700
I mean, it's gonna be hard.

55:14.500 --> 55:18.800
But it is as it is.

55:18.870 --> 55:22.830
We just have to find a way to...

55:30.000 --> 55:33.700
I don't want you to have to look after me.

55:36.100 --> 55:37.700
I want to.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.740
I choose to.

55:43.470 --> 55:44.740
Okay.

55:48.470 --> 55:50.500
I don't...

55:52.430 --> 55:56.000
I don't think Hans is a murderer.

55:56.070 --> 55:58.870
No, neither do I.

56:08.200 --> 56:10.250
Come on, be methodical.

56:10.300 --> 56:13.200
What do we know about him?

56:13.270 --> 56:16.010
What do we know about Haåkon?

56:39.100 --> 56:40.950
Good evening, OÖstermalmrestaurant.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.320
Hello, this is Kurt Wallander.

56:43.370 --> 56:48.970
I want to talk about some people
who worked at your restaurant.

56:59.630 --> 57:02.370
I was a Communist.

57:02.430 --> 57:04.620
I suppose I still am, in a way.

57:04.670 --> 57:09.370
The only political truth
that can't be questioned,

57:09.430 --> 57:11.300
in my opinion.

57:13.700 --> 57:16.900
Is that why you applied for the job?

57:17.930 --> 57:22.000
I was asked to apply by the party.

57:22.070 --> 57:25.670
It was of some interest to know
what conservative naval officers

57:25.730 --> 57:28.730
were talking about among themselves.

57:28.800 --> 57:32.030
Nobody suspected that a
waitress with swollen legs

57:32.100 --> 57:35.700
would remember what they'd said.

57:35.770 --> 57:37.720
It was 30 years ago.

57:37.770 --> 57:40.080
It can't matter now, can it?

57:40.130 --> 57:41.450
Do you, uh...

57:41.500 --> 57:43.180
Do you remember him?

57:43.230 --> 57:46.370
His name was Commander Von Enke?

57:46.430 --> 57:48.980
He was one of the better ones.

57:49.030 --> 57:53.300
He didn't drink too much,
didn't say too much.

57:53.350 --> 57:53.980
Polite.

57:54.030 --> 57:57.570
So you didn't know him?

57:58.900 --> 58:00.640
In what way?

58:01.330 --> 58:04.430
As a member of the party, or...?

58:05.930 --> 58:06.950
Him?

58:07.000 --> 58:08.570
No.

58:10.130 --> 58:12.980
He was the same as the rest of them.

58:13.030 --> 58:15.620
Hated the prime minister,
terrified of Russia.

58:15.670 --> 58:17.380
The fight between God and the Devil.

58:17.430 --> 58:21.330
And the Devil was in the East?

58:21.400 --> 58:24.470
And God the Father was
also known as the USA.

58:27.230 --> 58:31.570
Commander Von Enke's
wife has been found dead

58:31.630 --> 58:33.720
in mysterious circumstances.

58:33.770 --> 58:36.400
He has disappeared.

58:36.470 --> 58:37.650
Despite appearances,

58:37.700 --> 58:42.070
I think one or both of
them might have been...

58:42.130 --> 58:43.950
Had some involvement...

58:44.000 --> 58:49.070
I think one of them might have
been a Soviet agent, in fact.

58:49.130 --> 58:54.570
And I think somebody might have
killed them because of that.

58:57.630 --> 59:00.700
Could he have been the one who killed her?

59:00.770 --> 59:04.330
That's what usually happened.

59:06.270 --> 59:08.580
Or perhaps it has to do with the book.

59:08.630 --> 59:09.950
Which book?

59:10.000 --> 59:12.300
The historian.

59:12.370 --> 59:15.180
He's writing a book about all of this.

59:15.230 --> 59:17.730
I have something here.

59:17.800 --> 59:19.920
Did you discuss the submarine incursions?

59:19.970 --> 59:23.400
Yes, yes, that's him.

59:23.470 --> 59:25.530
Ola Vikander.

59:46.670 --> 59:48.470
Ola Vikander?

59:49.230 --> 59:51.750
You don't know me -- my
name's Kurt Wallander.

59:51.800 --> 59:53.630
Yes?

59:53.700 --> 59:55.730
I'm a policeman,

59:55.800 --> 59:59.470
and Haåkon Von Enke is my
daughter's father-in-law.

59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.220
Commander Von Enke is a dangerous man.

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:04.980
He is a traitor of the worst kind.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:06.080
Why do you say that?

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:07.650
He made sure that those submarines

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.250
would never be raised.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.020
There was never any orders.

01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:14.130
Then he made an almighty
fuss to cover his tracks.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.720
You delivered that card
to him on his birthday,

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:17.650
telling him what?

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:20.040
What was in that card?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.200
Ha!

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.680
I...

01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:27.930
No!

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:44.830
I tracked a record of payments
from the naval treasury

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.820
to a fisherman whose nets had been damaged

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:49.620
during the incursion.

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:54.230
Haåkon authorized
payments, and he overpaid.

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.330
The usual payment was 2,000 kronor.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.580
When I spoke to the fisherman,

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:03.070
he told me he had been paid 100,000.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:05.080
He found something,

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:08.630
and Haåkon paid him to keep it quiet.

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.450
So what does the fisherman say now?

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.550
He's dead.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.980
His son's alive.

01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:15.650
He knows something.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.380
He's keeping quiet.

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:19.250
Money clearly still talks.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.650
You know that Haåkon
Von Enke's wife is dead?

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.020
Yes, I saw.

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:27.100
Yeah, and I think that you
speaking to him prompted this...

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:28.780
Whatever this... whatever all this is.

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:31.520
He came here eventually
to find out what I knew,

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:34.970
to see how close I was getting to it.

01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:37.570
I can't prove it just now.

01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:43.000
My best lead was a defector
by the name of Ragulin,

01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:47.230
who maintained that there was a Soviet spy

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:51.200
in the OÖstermalm dining club.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:55.630
He had no corroborating
evidence, but I'll find it.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:01.170
Haåkon won't scare me off, dead or alive.

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:02.880
You don't think he is dead?

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:05.020
I don't believe it for a second.

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.200
He's alive.

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:09.630
He's dangerous.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:12.170
And he's behind all this.

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:33.120
What did Commander Von
Enke pay your father for?

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:35.120
The damage to the nets.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:36.780
And you told this man
from Stockholm about it?

01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:37.580
Yeah.

01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:38.950
You told him that

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.220
you had never asked your
father what he got paid for?

01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:42.800
No.

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:44.350
That you were never curious?

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.720
You never wanted to know
what your father knew?

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:49.550
You never wanted to know
what your father was paid

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.270
100,000 kronor to keep quiet about?

01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:54.720
What's it matter now, eh?

01:02:54.770 --> 01:03:01.830
This man who paid your father off is my...

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.950
Is my daughter's father-in-law,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.940
and he is my...

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:10.670
... granddaughter's other granddad.

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:13.350
And I don't know whether
he's alive or dead,

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.530
and I don't know whether he's dangerous.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:22.330
All I want to know is, if he's alive,

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.000
is are my family in danger?

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.570
And I don't think I have much time left,

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.630
and I really need to sort it out.

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:52.000
Come on.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.370
Come on.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.010
Hello, Kurt.

01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:43.620
Here you are.

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:45.920
Ah, that's mighty kind of you.

01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:47.910
To your health.

01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:53.050
So, what are you doing here?

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.040
I guess I didn't make my flight.

01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:02.030
I've been trying to think
of some piece of information

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:05.870
that might help figure
out what's happened.

01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:08.800
And did you think of something?

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:12.970
A friend of mine and
I, we were colleagues,

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:18.470
and I had this deal with
him that he would help me,

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:21.520
and if ever he became
troubled by any consequences,

01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:26.130
then he would let me know, and
I would help him in return.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.020
And the way that he would let me know

01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:32.130
would be that he would disappear.

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:37.120
And how would you help him?

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:37.850
I'd find him.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.040
Take him elsewhere.

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:51.000
This is an American device?

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:51.980
Those submarines weren't Russian,

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:52.880
they were American.

01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:55.530
Haåkon was working for you.

01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:59.350
At that time, it was considered a priority

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.250
to destabilize the government here.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.250
It was perceived as being communist.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.370
It worked.

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:08.280
After the fake Russian subs,

01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:12.300
support for the East dwindled
away to almost nothing.

01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:14.650
Which was another border made safe.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:18.670
Another front closed down.

01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:22.230
And Louise?

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.930
Louise?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.320
Was it always part of the rescue plan

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:26.850
that she would die?

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.600
That he'd arrange a suicide,
leave evidence to blame her?

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:32.610
I liked Louise.

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:35.910
Where is he?

01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:42.270
Waiting for me.

01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:44.480
But I won't go fetch him.

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:49.200
It would be inadvisable
for us to become involved.

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:54.800
Far better for someone else,
someone with an interest,

01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:58.970
to make him face up to
his responsibilities.

01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:01.100
To what he's done.

01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:06.270
What about your responsibilities?

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.320
You wouldn't be here

01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:13.600
if you weren't afraid to face them.

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:15.280
If I confront Haåkon with what he's done,

01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:18.630
I'll make sure I do the same for you.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.870
You're not in the best of health.

01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:31.830
You have a family.

01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:37.470
Are you sure you want to make that threat?

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:42.770
Where is he?

01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:08.680
Haåkon, it's Kurt.

01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:11.200
I'm going to turn around.

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:15.170
Put the rifle down.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.670
Turn around, if you wish.

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:40.800
Move.

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:56.570
If you leave me --

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:59.770
if you let me go out of here, Kurt --

01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:02.000
I'll let you go.

01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:05.200
Where the hell do you think you're going?

01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:08.830
They're not going to come and get you.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.880
You're waiting down here

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:11.050
for a boat that will never arrive.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.830
Wilson sold you out.

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.750
- No.
- Yes, he did.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.570
- No.
- Yes, he did.

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:24.130
I'm not going down in
history as a traitor.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.970
My family...

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:30.830
Klara will not grow up

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.030
with the shame of what I've done.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.370
Yet you'll let them believe the lie

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:40.130
of what your wife did?

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.930
My wife?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.130
My wife cannot be
punished, living or dead,

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.170
any more than she has
punished me and my daughter.

01:11:53.230 --> 01:11:55.500
So you destroyed her.

01:11:58.030 --> 01:12:03.100
You destroyed yourself
all to hide your treachery

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:06.370
in a war that finished 30 years ago.

01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:09.530
You and I both do similar things, Kurt.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.770
We see things, live through things

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:16.300
that would horrify any normal person.

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:20.500
We do it to protect our children.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.150
Haåkon Von Enke, you're under arrest

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.200
for the murder of Louise Von Enke.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.400
No.

01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:54.470
Allow me to go.

01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:08.100
You know I can't do that.

01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:46.140
Kurt?

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.730
Kurt?

01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:15.330
Haåkon?

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.970
Haåkon!

01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:18.530
Haåkon!

01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:35.000
Despondency breaks off its course.

01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:39.630
Anguish breaks off its course.

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:44.930
The vulture breaks off its flight.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.670
The eager light streams out.

01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:53.470
Even the ghosts take a draft.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.730
And our paintings see daylight,

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:03.100
our red beasts of the ice age studios.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.150
Everything begins to look around.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.070
We walk in the sun in hundreds.

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:18.830
Each man is a half-open door,
leading to a room for everyone.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:24.530
The endless ground under us.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:28.930
The water is shining among the trees.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.600
The lake is a window into the earth.

01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:41.580
Where did he wash up?

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:45.230
Near Saltshamn.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:48.170
Drowning's the worst way to go.

01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:53.070
Yes, well...

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:56.970
My condolences.

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:58.830
Thanks.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:14.400
Okay, I'm going to get you
too if you're going to get me.

01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:25.430
Oh no, oh no!

01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:32.770
Thanks.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:40.270
Funny when you have kids.

01:17:40.330 --> 01:17:44.930
You start understanding your own parents.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.130
You realize, you know,
eventually, you start...

01:17:49.630 --> 01:17:57.730
Being a parent is more or less
a long process of letting go.

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:06.170
I never got to give Linda away.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.570
I'm glad she married you.

01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:19.410
Got any advice?

01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:26.770
Nah.

01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:29.370
You don't need any advice.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.400
It's just moments now, Dad.

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:46.830
Everything.

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:50.530
It's just moments now.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.740
They don't join up.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.770
What don't?

01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:58.570
My memories.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:05.030
My life doesn't join up.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.880
I can't remember.

01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:09.570
Someone else will remember.

01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:14.500
Someone will remember for you.

01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:19.270
Dad?

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:25.530
Jussi!

01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:37.930
You okay?

01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:40.240
Yeah.

01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:45.810
I'm fine.
