WEBVTT

00:44.778 --> 00:47.315
Walk, don't run, Barker.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.667
Smith, how many slaves

01:06.734 --> 01:09.170
did Washington
and Jefferson have?

01:09.237 --> 01:10.871
Oh, come on.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.473
Just this once?

01:12.540 --> 01:14.142
I promise.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.177
Washington had 300,

01:16.244 --> 01:17.645
Jefferson 600.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.980
God bless America.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.805
Thomas, you'll lead
the Pledge today.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.274
Yes, sir.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.550
Class, rise.

02:00.721 --> 02:04.392
I swear I will
observe the law,

02:04.458 --> 02:08.896
conscientiously fulfill
my duties at home and school,

02:08.962 --> 02:11.232
be faithful and obedient

02:11.299 --> 02:14.668
and pledge absolute
allegiance until death

02:14.735 --> 02:17.205
to the leader
of the Nazi Empire

02:17.205 --> 02:18.772
Adolf Hitler.

02:20.874 --> 02:25.213
Sieg heil!
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

04:22.696 --> 04:24.332
Ohh!

04:25.198 --> 04:26.400
You all right?

04:26.467 --> 04:27.968
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.042
It's my family.

04:37.911 --> 04:38.846
Lucky guy.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.614
Yeah.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.950
A fella's got to work
for something, right?

04:54.595 --> 04:56.129
Did you guys get
that radio working yet?

04:56.196 --> 04:57.998
Not yet.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.903
Mind if I take
a look at it myself?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.473
What's the rush, friend?

05:05.539 --> 05:07.508
There's a gal
who got me on the boat.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.378
I need to...
make sure she's okay.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.946
We'll get that radio
working.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.382
Don't you worry.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.207
- He's coming.
- Who?

05:40.273 --> 05:42.309
The guy we answer to.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.011
Why did you do it, Juliana?

05:45.446 --> 05:47.448
You're in love with him?
Is that it?

05:47.515 --> 05:49.483
They're going to need
a reason, Juliana,

05:49.550 --> 05:51.018
a good one.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.154
I couldn't--

05:54.221 --> 05:55.423
I couldn't
take his life, Karen.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.857
I couldn't let you, either.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.093
Where's Frank?

06:00.160 --> 06:01.429
I don't know.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.896
I told him someone
shot the Crown Prince,

06:02.963 --> 06:04.498
then he ran off,
I don't know where.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.095
Well?

06:37.598 --> 06:40.033
She just couldn't--
She just couldn't do it.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.268
I don't think she meant--

06:41.334 --> 06:42.870
Doesn't matter
what the hell she meant.

06:42.936 --> 06:43.537
Lem.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.539
Does it?

06:45.606 --> 06:47.475
You know me, Lem.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.777
Yeah. I know you.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.314
I don't believe he'd hurt you,

06:54.381 --> 06:55.916
any of you.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.819
We needed that film.

07:00.488 --> 07:01.522
She knew it.

07:01.589 --> 07:04.625
None of you watched
that film. I did.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.359
You take me to the Man
in the High Castle.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.696
Take me and I can describe
it to him frame by frame.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.731
You've got a lot
of goddamn nerve.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.066
Ask him. Ask him
if he wants to see me.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.503
Already did.

08:29.142 --> 08:32.813
You wish to make
a statement, Mr. Frink?

08:33.881 --> 08:36.617
You know Ed McCarthy...

08:36.684 --> 08:38.819
didn't shoot
the Crown Prince.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.658
I had to do something after--

08:46.994 --> 08:49.262
after you killed my sister...

08:51.331 --> 08:52.800
and her kids.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.670
So you shot him
as an act of revenge?

08:56.737 --> 08:58.639
You know I did.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.879
The general has arrived.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.919
Aren't you
going to arrest me?

09:13.621 --> 09:15.856
You did not shoot
the Crown Prince.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.727
As a Jew, you know
I need no charges

09:19.793 --> 09:21.361
to order your death.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.730
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.198
Then you will accept
your friend's confession.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.468
Confession?

09:28.535 --> 09:30.771
He confessed?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.541
I did it, okay?

09:34.642 --> 09:36.243
I did it.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.246
Okay, look--

09:40.413 --> 09:42.816
I did it, all right?
I did it.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.185
I'm the one
who's supposed to die.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.888
Okay? Please.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.522
I'm the one
who's supposed to die.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.059
I'm the one
who's supposed to die.

10:09.643 --> 10:10.911
General Onoda.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.048
I trust you had
a pleasant journey.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.652
My first time on American
soil since the war,

10:18.719 --> 10:20.320
Kido Tai-i.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.255
Much has changed.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.659
Indeed.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.194
We must go out,
you and I,

10:27.260 --> 10:28.662
to see just how much.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.731
I understand
the North Beach area

10:30.798 --> 10:34.001
has excellent
hostess bars.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.004
So I have been told.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.841
Your sergeant tells me
there's cause to celebrate.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.844
You have a suspect
in the shooting
of the Crown Prince.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.746
The investigation
is not yet complete,

10:45.813 --> 10:49.016
but yes. The case will be
presented tomorrow.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.317
Excellent.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.820
And a film you were pursuing

10:52.886 --> 10:54.955
from the Man
in the High Castle.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.190
It fell into the hands
of the Yakuza.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.225
We--

10:59.392 --> 11:00.828
I lost it.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.163
We shall celebrate,
nonetheless.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.737
Don't press too hard.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.372
Just short strokes
back and forth.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.774
That's it.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.311
Mom, there's
a car outside.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.749
Uh....I'll go see.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.283
Stay with Amy, okay?

12:08.896 --> 12:11.164
You see? I'm fine.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.266
Just fine.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.803
You all right?

12:15.803 --> 12:17.237
What happened?

12:19.006 --> 12:21.441
Heydrich's in prison,
where he belongs.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.645
He'll be questioned...

12:25.712 --> 12:28.248
and hanged as a traitor.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.950
So it's over.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.685
Heydrich
has allies in Berlin:

12:32.820 --> 12:34.487
men prepared to betray
the FÃ¼hrer,

12:34.554 --> 12:35.823
just as he was.

12:35.823 --> 12:36.990
You have to arrest them.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.893
We would if we knew
who they were.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.230
We can't be sure,
and these men
are very dangerous.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.034
So...

12:49.569 --> 12:50.871
you can now...

12:52.105 --> 12:54.374
You can give me
that gun back now.

13:08.655 --> 13:09.857
Hey.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.860
What is it?

13:15.863 --> 13:17.931
I know that you count
on me to be strong.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.268
You are strong.
You're the strongest
person I know.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.705
When I thought about turning
that gun on our children--

13:25.772 --> 13:30.510
If Heydrich had pulled up
in that car instead of me--

13:30.577 --> 13:32.946
I know that. I know that.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.882
But I couldn't have--

13:34.882 --> 13:36.449
Our children--
I couldn't have.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.003
Understood.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.476
You got that radio
working, huh?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.081
You're a goddamn Nazi.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.582
Yeah.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.954
The film. Hand it over.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.423
This film.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.559
If you drop that, you're dead.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.364
How much is the Resistance
going to pay you for it?

14:24.431 --> 14:25.765
50,000.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.167
Look, you guys
are being cheated.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.936
The Yakuza sold it
for twice that,

14:29.002 --> 14:31.704
and I got to tell you
I don't think the
Resistance has the money.

14:31.771 --> 14:32.940
Bullshit.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.943
Look, you guys need cash.
Am I right?

14:36.009 --> 14:37.577
To support your families.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.147
Come on, that's why you smuggle
people like me down to Mexico.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.348
- What's your point?
- Shut up.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.315
I'm not a Nazi.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.716
But I am selling
this film to them,

14:43.783 --> 14:45.818
and there can be a lot
of money in this for you, too.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.421
A lot of money.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.557
- How much?
- I said shut up.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.525
200,000 yen.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.200
200,000 each.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.575
I'm the one
who's supposed to die.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.000
Uhh!

15:53.386 --> 15:55.388
Where is the Trade Minister?

15:55.455 --> 15:58.491
I don't know,
Chief Inspector.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.729
I have been unable
to reach him since the--

16:02.795 --> 16:04.064
I am here.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.737
Are you...quite all right,
Trade Minister?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.389
Since the war,

16:29.456 --> 16:33.326
we have shared an uneasy
alliance with the Nazis.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.230
Now the FÃ¼hrer is ill,

16:37.297 --> 16:40.667
and his men boast
of their will...

16:43.436 --> 16:45.272
We know we must strike
before they strike.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.076
Get your hotdogs
right here!

16:49.109 --> 16:50.577
We got candied apples
and...

16:53.480 --> 16:56.083
Today we
enter the tiger's cave.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.851
We enter it because
two weeks ago

16:58.918 --> 17:03.356
Science Minister Shimura
found a capsule in his pocket,

17:03.423 --> 17:06.459
and inside the capsule
was microfilm

17:06.526 --> 17:10.563
smuggled from the Reich
Research Council in Berlin.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.572
The contents of the microfilm
has been confirmed.

17:19.639 --> 17:25.011
At long last, we, too,
possess the data

17:25.112 --> 17:28.115
to build a Heisenberg device.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.218
When it is completed,

17:31.284 --> 17:33.853
the device must be in range

17:33.920 --> 17:36.156
of North American
Nazi targets...

17:36.223 --> 17:38.958
of New York City.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.794
This is our moment.

17:41.861 --> 17:45.532
We must not hesitate
to seize it.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.246
Trade Minister.

18:04.451 --> 18:07.154
I am all but certain
you have passed those plans

18:07.154 --> 18:10.723
to the Science Minister
with that Nazi colonel.

18:10.790 --> 18:14.427
Are you here to arrest me,
Chief Inspector?

18:16.429 --> 18:19.899
Trade Minister, I know
that this is what you wish,

18:19.966 --> 18:23.436
and yet you seem...
troubled.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.406
I wish for parity
with the Nazis,

18:26.473 --> 18:29.242
to balance the power,
to maintain the peace.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.778
You heard the general.
War is inevitable.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.282
Possibly.

18:35.348 --> 18:39.051
But with a weapon
like this...

18:39.186 --> 18:41.654
how can such a war be won?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.320
Let's open it up.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.090
Oh ho ho ho.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.093
- Mm.
- Yeah.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.795
- Mm.
- Yes.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.232
Ha ha ha ha ha!

19:25.232 --> 19:26.999
That's their end
of the bargain.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.835
Get him out of here, Slim.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.671
- Ha ha ha!
- Don't spend it all
in one place, boys.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.612
Thank you, man.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.905
Whoo.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.407
Am I glad to see you.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.941
Let's get you to New York.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.744
Okay.

20:11.811 --> 20:15.014
Here, here, here, here.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.416
- Where's my bag?
- Here's your bag.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.584
Come on, Captain.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.286
Come on, Jack,
let's get back fast.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.575
Good morning,
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.576
Major Klemm.

20:43.643 --> 20:44.644
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Duncan

20:44.711 --> 20:45.645
is eager
to speak with you, sir.

20:45.712 --> 20:46.746
Has Joe Blake
reported in?

20:46.813 --> 20:48.281
He's waiting
in your office now.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.724
Joe.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.596
Congratulations.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.604
I'm very pleased.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.848
Something wrong, Joe?

21:23.683 --> 21:26.586
You told me
you'd pay those men.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.655
They were criminals, Joe.

21:30.590 --> 21:34.361
Criminals who wanted you dead.
You should feel no remorse.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.172
What about Juliana Crain?

21:46.238 --> 21:47.440
Oh, she's dead.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.377
Almost certainly.

21:50.377 --> 21:53.380
It's been nearly
24 hours, Joe.

21:54.447 --> 21:57.450
You've proved yourself
capable,

21:57.517 --> 21:59.852
but in the future

21:59.919 --> 22:02.021
you have to learn to keep
your feelings in check.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.158
I can't do that, sir.

22:06.225 --> 22:08.294
Oh, you can't?

22:08.395 --> 22:10.863
I'd like to resign.

22:12.732 --> 22:15.134
You don't get to resign,
Joe.

22:15.201 --> 22:17.069
- You got your film.
- Yes.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.706
A film of great importance
to the FÃ¼hrer.

22:19.772 --> 22:22.575
Think about
what that means, Joe.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.846
Think how proud
your father will be.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.284
My father doesn't even
know I work for you.

22:32.419 --> 22:33.853
Oh, of course he does.

22:36.723 --> 22:40.026
Now, I stuck with you...

22:40.092 --> 22:43.262
because I always believed

22:43.329 --> 22:45.632
that when the time came,

22:45.698 --> 22:47.834
you'd do what had to be done.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.072
This isn't
the man I want to be.

22:57.744 --> 23:00.447
This isn't the man
you wanted to be?

23:03.215 --> 23:04.551
I see.

23:13.359 --> 23:15.962
Well, it seems
I misjudged you, Joe.

23:26.172 --> 23:29.241
Major Klemm, what time
is my flight to Berlin?

23:29.308 --> 23:31.043
It leaves in an hour, sir.

23:34.380 --> 23:35.948
Can I go now?

23:40.653 --> 23:41.921
Yes, you can go.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.912
You wish to see me,
Trade Minister?

24:42.715 --> 24:49.321
You told me before
to not lose hope.

24:49.388 --> 24:52.692
That I should keep
meditating.

24:52.759 --> 24:56.228
I hoped meditation
might bring you peace,

24:56.295 --> 24:57.697
as it does me.

24:57.764 --> 24:59.799
And nothing more.

25:04.637 --> 25:07.173
I went to the park
to meditate.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.110
But it did not
bring me peace.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.181
It brought me...

25:16.382 --> 25:18.585
to a strange place.

25:19.619 --> 25:20.953
It was San Francisco

25:21.020 --> 25:25.825
but not
this San Francisco.

25:25.892 --> 25:29.796
It was ruled
by Americans...

25:29.862 --> 25:34.233
walking freely,
shouting...

25:35.968 --> 25:37.069
and laughing.

25:38.605 --> 25:41.107
You had a dream
of the past.

25:41.173 --> 25:44.043
No. No.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.613
It wasn't the past.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.317
And it didn't feel
like a dream.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.096
Get a hold
of the Crown Princess.

26:04.163 --> 26:07.634
Tell her that I have
an urgent matter to discuss.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.426
Juliana.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.069
Juliana. Hey.

26:46.405 --> 26:47.674
Arnold.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.143
What happened to you?

26:53.880 --> 26:54.947
I just had an accident.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.582
You don't want
to get that infected.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.785
- Come on, let me help you.
- I don't need your help.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.687
- Are you alone?
- Yeah, I'm alone.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.255
Listen, you guys,
you left in such a hurry,

27:03.322 --> 27:05.457
I wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

27:05.524 --> 27:06.693
Where's Jules?

27:06.726 --> 27:08.695
She's gone.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.730
What's that supposed
to mean, she's gone?

27:10.797 --> 27:12.865
It means she had
to get out of here.

27:16.535 --> 27:18.570
Is she safe?

27:18.705 --> 27:20.306
No, no thanks to you.

27:22.241 --> 27:23.843
I don't know what that's
supposed to mean, either.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.477
How long have you worked
for them, Arnold?

27:25.544 --> 27:27.146
In the Nippon Building?

27:28.547 --> 27:30.850
How can you do it? How could
you live with yourself?

27:30.917 --> 27:32.852
Spying on your own people?
What kind of man are you?

27:32.919 --> 27:34.721
The kind of man that takes
care of his family.

27:34.787 --> 27:37.189
- I tried to help--
- You didn't take
care of your family.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.791
You got Trudy killed.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.962
God damn you, Frank.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.933
I did not get
my daughter killed.

27:46.999 --> 27:50.302
- I tried to help her.
- You're a fucking Pon.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.612
This is about Ed, isn't it?

28:00.747 --> 28:01.981
What do you know about Ed?

28:02.048 --> 28:03.783
I'm in a listening
room, Frank.

28:03.850 --> 28:04.951
I hear everything.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.819
I heard his grandfather
on the phone.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.087
Arnold,
you got to help him.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.956
I cannot help him.
Nobody can help him.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.024
Come on.
The Kempeitai's got him.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.826
- Frank--
- The Kempeitai.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.028
I tried
to help my own daughter,
and look what happened.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.898
- Oh, come on.
- You got to leave this alone.

28:32.344 --> 28:33.412
You'll need to--

28:33.479 --> 28:35.782
You need to find a Pon.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.319
Somebody well connected.

28:40.386 --> 28:44.023
I don't know any
well connected Pons.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.494
Then find someone who does.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.524
Well, well, well, Mr. Frink.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.292
Have you reconsidered?

29:20.359 --> 29:20.827
Reconsidered?

29:20.893 --> 29:22.261
Yeah, my offer

29:22.328 --> 29:24.496
to place some more
authentic Americana

29:24.563 --> 29:25.832
with my Japanese
clientele.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.433
Listen, you got a problem.
We both do.

29:27.499 --> 29:28.700
What sort of problem?

29:28.835 --> 29:30.669
A friend of mine's
been arrested

29:30.736 --> 29:31.871
for shooting
the Crown Prince.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.873
Then forced him to confess.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.008
So what does that
have to do with me?

29:36.075 --> 29:37.176
He was caught with a gun.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.978
The shells in the chamber
were yours.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.086
Sumimasen,
but I must close.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.922
Uh, uh, a sick aunt.
Sumimasen.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.458
Sumimasen.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.428
Sumimasen.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.572
- What have you done?
- My friend's not guilty.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.008
It's only a matter of time
before they come for me
to kill me.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.643
You must have some
wealthy Japanese clients.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.012
So what if I do?

30:13.079 --> 30:14.613
Well, if you could--
I don't know--

30:14.680 --> 30:15.848
talk to one of them,

30:15.915 --> 30:17.716
get him
to pull some strings.

30:17.783 --> 30:20.019
Pull some st--
Are you out of your mind?

30:20.086 --> 30:21.287
Come on. I'm just
trying to help you.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.689
Help me? It's because
of you, Mr. Frink,

30:23.755 --> 30:25.291
I'm a dead man.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.226
Yeah, you will be
a dead man

30:27.293 --> 30:30.596
unless we find a way
to get my friend
out of this.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.024
How's that sedative
treating you?

31:05.164 --> 31:08.334
Mm. I need
something to drink.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.070
Puzzles.

31:12.438 --> 31:13.940
So many puzzles.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.407
And you are...

31:17.076 --> 31:20.947
just another pretty piece.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.718
- I was dead.
- Heh.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.654
Maybe you are.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.956
What's that
supposed to mean?

31:31.690 --> 31:33.759
Truth is as terrible
as death.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.661
But harder to find.

31:41.133 --> 31:44.336
You have an unnatural mind.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.440
Are you aware of that?

31:57.749 --> 31:59.118
You already got one.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.421
Right.

32:07.726 --> 32:08.894
Mm.

32:08.995 --> 32:10.362
Ohh.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.397
Where am I?

32:11.463 --> 32:13.299
You answer my questions,
chickie,

32:13.365 --> 32:15.401
not the other way around.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.371
You understand?

32:20.472 --> 32:21.507
Yeah.

32:21.573 --> 32:22.641
Mm.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.017
Come with me.

32:57.776 --> 33:01.047
'59, '60...

34:29.668 --> 34:30.836
You're him, aren't you?

34:30.902 --> 34:34.973
I'm Abendsen,
Hawthorn Abendsen.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.608
This is your castle.

34:36.675 --> 34:40.712
This is my castle right here,

34:40.779 --> 34:43.849
the conscious
and unconscious mind,

34:43.915 --> 34:44.916
the psyche.

34:44.983 --> 34:48.254
Karl Jung. Got it?

35:03.169 --> 35:04.336
That's a home movie.

35:04.403 --> 35:08.474
4th of July fireworks
in Phoenix.

35:08.540 --> 35:12.978
4th of July in 1961.
It's not possible.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.846
But it is.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.183
You're holding it.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.846
Tell me
about the film you saw.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.016
It's like a newsreel.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.484
Uh-huh.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.493
I've never
seen anything so...

36:03.795 --> 36:06.131
desolate. It was--
It was San Francisco,

36:06.232 --> 36:07.499
but it was all ruins.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.804
I can make out
the Golden Gate Bridge.

36:12.871 --> 36:16.007
There were shadows
of some of the victims.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.776
They were like...

36:17.843 --> 36:19.578
like burns.

36:30.289 --> 36:31.490
It was--

36:31.557 --> 36:33.759
The end.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.279
What about people?

36:53.279 --> 36:55.080
- What about them?
- Did you see any

36:55.146 --> 36:56.815
after the explosion?
Come on.

37:01.787 --> 37:04.790
There were men lined up
by Nazi soldiers.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.058
They looked like they were
with the Resistance--

37:07.125 --> 37:08.827
- partisans--
- How many?

37:08.894 --> 37:11.129
Ten, maybe 12 soldiers.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.898
Did you recognize anyone?

37:19.571 --> 37:21.006
Why would you ask me that?

37:21.072 --> 37:22.641
Just answer
the question.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.446
My boyfriend Frank.

37:27.513 --> 37:31.216
He was executed by,
uh, a man, a young man.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.818
Joe Blake.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.853
I know who he is.
I know who they both are.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.121
How?

37:36.187 --> 37:38.690
Did you recognize
anyone else?

37:42.328 --> 37:43.829
The man next to Frank.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.798
- Who was he?
- I'm not sure.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.467
He just looked familiar.

37:48.534 --> 37:52.604
Okay. I'm going
to show you a face.

37:52.671 --> 37:56.007
Tell me if it is
the man you saw.

37:58.910 --> 38:02.147
That film I saw-- is that
what's going to happen?

38:02.213 --> 38:08.119
Each one of these films
show a reality like ours

38:08.186 --> 38:10.956
but not ours.

38:11.022 --> 38:15.694
Well, you learn an awful lot
watching these films.

38:15.761 --> 38:19.631
Some of us are
just the same--

38:19.698 --> 38:23.201
rotten or kind
in one reality,

38:23.268 --> 38:25.537
rotten or kind in the next,

38:25.604 --> 38:27.906
but most people
are different,

38:27.973 --> 38:31.477
depending on whether they
have food in their belly

38:31.543 --> 38:33.712
or they're hungry,

38:33.779 --> 38:35.381
safe or scared.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.615
So you watch these films.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.550
You tell the Resistance
what you learn--

38:38.617 --> 38:40.652
about the people you see
and the things.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.754
Things that could
happen here, too.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.291
That's why--

38:46.392 --> 38:48.594
That's why the Nazis
want these films.

38:48.660 --> 38:52.664
Not the Nazis,
just old Adolf.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.633
That demented bastard's
too paranoid

38:54.700 --> 38:56.768
to let anyone else
see them.

39:06.011 --> 39:06.945
Oh, God.

39:08.013 --> 39:08.947
Wait.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.553
Was this the man you saw?

39:15.821 --> 39:17.255
In the film,

39:17.322 --> 39:18.857
he was shot by the Nazis.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.292
He was one of the partisans,
but here he's--

39:21.427 --> 39:22.494
he's a Nazi.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.863
So this was the man.
You recognize him.

39:25.931 --> 39:26.865
I think so.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.501
I don't know.

39:29.568 --> 39:30.769
You don't know. You don't--

39:30.836 --> 39:32.871
You either recognize him,
or you don't.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.540
I'm not po--
I'm not positive.

39:34.606 --> 39:35.774
- Come on, think!
- I'm trying.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.576
You must have
met him somewhere,

39:37.643 --> 39:39.778
seen him someplace.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.020
Then we're screwed.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.889
What are you
talking about?

39:50.956 --> 39:53.459
That's the reason
you're here, chickie.

39:53.459 --> 39:55.861
Every film where the Japs
won the war,

39:55.927 --> 39:59.297
sooner or later San Francisco
is wiped out by an A bomb--

39:59.364 --> 40:01.833
every one except this one

40:01.900 --> 40:04.836
where this bastard dies as
a Nazi in an alley somewhere.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.739
Are you telling me
that if this man
can be found, the--

40:09.407 --> 40:10.976
we could stop--

40:12.077 --> 40:13.445
Yeah.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.652
I don't know who he is.

42:20.505 --> 42:22.874
My sister said
these films were a way out.

42:24.009 --> 42:25.310
Out?

42:25.376 --> 42:28.614
She told me she'd found
the answer to everything.

42:32.618 --> 42:33.819
Yeah.

42:43.461 --> 42:44.996
I saw her...

42:46.197 --> 42:47.298
a few days ago.

42:51.803 --> 42:54.105
She's dead, I know.
I know she's dead.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.907
But she-- she wasn't.

42:57.042 --> 43:00.445
Is it possible my sister
is alive out there

43:00.511 --> 43:02.047
somehow?

43:05.416 --> 43:09.220
I said you don't
ask questions.

43:09.287 --> 43:11.723
You answer them, got it?

43:13.058 --> 43:16.695
Why? Why are you
so angry at me?

43:16.762 --> 43:19.530
Because if you'd seen
what I've seen,

43:19.665 --> 43:21.532
you'd be angry, too.

43:21.667 --> 43:24.836
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

43:24.903 --> 43:26.237
Am I in these films?

43:26.304 --> 43:27.472
Why? Why don't--

43:27.538 --> 43:28.740
Why don't people ever learn?

43:28.807 --> 43:29.775
I am, aren't I?

43:29.841 --> 43:30.809
What did you see?

43:30.876 --> 43:32.377
Fear and violence!

43:32.443 --> 43:33.679
It's who we are.

43:33.679 --> 43:35.847
our whole miserable world,

43:35.914 --> 43:37.883
and people like you,
you j-- you j--

43:37.949 --> 43:39.317
- you end up--
- End up how?

43:39.384 --> 43:41.419
How do I end up?
What about my sister?

43:41.486 --> 43:42.888
Answer me!

43:44.589 --> 43:45.991
The film of your life--

43:46.057 --> 43:48.760
you don't want to see
how it ends.

44:45.216 --> 44:46.985
Hello.

44:47.052 --> 44:50.288
Is that Mrs. Wegener?

44:52.758 --> 44:54.359
Who is this?

44:58.029 --> 45:00.766
This is Tagomi Nobusuke.

45:00.832 --> 45:03.969
I met the colonel
last year in Stockholm

45:04.035 --> 45:05.804
at a trade convention.

45:06.938 --> 45:10.008
Would it be possible
to speak to him?

45:13.344 --> 45:14.846
My husband...

45:16.681 --> 45:17.983
is dead.

45:19.317 --> 45:20.651
He...

45:24.189 --> 45:25.156
Mm...

45:26.524 --> 45:29.494
May I ask what happened?

45:32.898 --> 45:35.801
They say he shot himself.

45:35.834 --> 45:37.803
He was a traitor.

45:40.605 --> 45:43.374
You must know.

45:43.441 --> 45:49.848
Your husband died trying to
make the world a better place.

45:51.382 --> 45:52.918
And did he?

45:56.855 --> 45:59.825
Trying is not enough, is it?

46:16.975 --> 46:18.877
What about this guy Kera?

46:18.944 --> 46:20.278
What about him?

46:20.345 --> 46:21.980
He works
in the Nippon Building.

46:22.047 --> 46:24.215
He's a bureaucrat
with a taste for sake

46:24.282 --> 46:26.251
and Judy Garland
memorabilia.

46:29.687 --> 46:31.689
All right, this one?

46:31.756 --> 46:33.859
Kyoto. No,
he's a silk merchant.

46:33.892 --> 46:35.260
He moved back to Japan.

46:36.394 --> 46:38.063
If I had any sense,
I'd be on a bus

46:38.129 --> 46:39.597
to the Neutral Zone
right now.

46:39.664 --> 46:41.066
Then why aren't you?

46:41.132 --> 46:42.567
You must have enough money.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.369
You ever been
to the Neutral Zone?

46:45.770 --> 46:47.238
- No.
- Then you have no idea

46:47.305 --> 46:48.907
how difficult it would be
for a man of culture

46:48.974 --> 46:50.976
to survive
in an armpit like that.

46:52.043 --> 46:54.279
All right, I got it.

46:54.345 --> 46:55.380
Paul Kasoura.

46:56.481 --> 46:57.648
Yeah, not a chance.

46:57.715 --> 46:59.150
Why not?
It says he's a lawyer.

46:59.217 --> 47:00.618
Lawyers are well connected,
aren't they?

47:00.685 --> 47:02.087
Yeah,
he's indeed a lawyer,

47:02.153 --> 47:03.688
but I sold him and his
lovely wife Betty

47:03.754 --> 47:05.290
that Sitting Bull
gorget you made.

47:05.356 --> 47:06.892
- Yeah, so?
- So it's a forgery.

47:06.958 --> 47:08.126
The last thing we need

47:08.193 --> 47:11.329
is any further attention
from the Kasouras.

47:11.396 --> 47:13.131
Hey, did you hear
what I just said?

47:13.198 --> 47:14.966
This man's
Ed's last chance

47:15.033 --> 47:17.002
and yours, too.

47:22.340 --> 47:23.608
Now come on.

47:44.095 --> 47:45.830
Those guys are Yakuza.

47:45.931 --> 47:49.134
Yeah. So I suggest
you let me do the talking.

48:00.411 --> 48:02.247
- You again.
- We need to see Mr. Kasoura.

48:02.313 --> 48:05.183
Mr. Kasoura does not receive
unannounced visitors,

48:05.250 --> 48:07.352
- and you were told--
- It's all right, Fred.

48:08.954 --> 48:11.022
What is it you want,
Mr. Childan?

48:11.089 --> 48:13.124
Uh, just a moment
of your time, sir.

48:13.191 --> 48:15.093
I assure you
it will be worth it.

48:17.262 --> 48:18.096
Come in.

48:26.204 --> 48:29.074
You are a criminal
defense lawyer,

48:29.140 --> 48:30.241
are you not, Mr. Kasoura?

48:30.308 --> 48:32.777
- Yes.
- I have a case for you,

48:32.843 --> 48:35.280
a very important one.

48:35.346 --> 48:37.782
You see,
this man has a friend

48:37.848 --> 48:41.252
who has been falsely accused
of attacking the Crown Prince.

48:42.420 --> 48:43.989
We do not speak
of such things.

48:43.989 --> 48:45.190
Of course. Of course.

48:45.256 --> 48:47.758
But-- But he is innocent.

48:47.825 --> 48:50.295
I am absolutely certain of it.

48:51.396 --> 48:53.131
What does that
have to do with me?

48:53.198 --> 48:55.766
Well, don't you see?

48:55.833 --> 48:58.336
If the wrong man
has been charged

48:58.403 --> 49:00.305
with attacking
the Crown Prince,

49:00.371 --> 49:03.808
there can be no more serious
miscarriage of justice.

49:03.874 --> 49:07.212
Now, were you to prove this,

49:07.278 --> 49:12.183
it would make you yuumei,
very yuumei.

49:12.250 --> 49:15.020
My clients are private,
Mr. Childan.

49:15.053 --> 49:17.022
I have no interest
in fame,

49:17.022 --> 49:19.257
and I certainly
have no interest

49:19.324 --> 49:22.527
in defending a man
accused of attacking
the Crown Prince.

49:22.593 --> 49:25.030
Forgive a white man's
shallow understanding,

49:25.030 --> 49:27.198
but surely duty
to empire dictates--

49:27.265 --> 49:30.035
You must leave now.

49:30.101 --> 49:33.204
Mr., uh, Mr. Childan,

49:33.271 --> 49:36.541
he sold you this neck plate...

49:37.842 --> 49:40.145
for 80,000 yen.

49:41.746 --> 49:42.747
Yes?

49:43.881 --> 49:45.383
An excellent price

49:45.450 --> 49:46.917
- for such a--
- It's a fake.

49:47.052 --> 49:48.286
Frank.

49:49.887 --> 49:51.056
Why do you say that?

49:51.089 --> 49:54.292
Well, uh, because, uh...

49:56.327 --> 49:57.595
because I made it.

49:57.662 --> 49:59.797
He's lying.

49:59.864 --> 50:01.832
No, I'm not.

50:01.899 --> 50:04.669
I left the edges
unpolished.

50:04.735 --> 50:06.271
Um...

50:07.172 --> 50:10.041
here and here,

50:10.108 --> 50:14.045
to fool even the most
experienced collector
like you.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.415
Uh, this man
is clearly deluded.

50:17.482 --> 50:19.016
The stress of seeing
his friend accused.

50:19.084 --> 50:20.518
Our sincerest apologies,
Kasoura-san.

50:20.585 --> 50:22.787
- We'll leave now.
- You're going nowhere.

50:55.986 --> 50:57.555
You missed the turnoff.

50:57.622 --> 51:00.525
I didn't miss anything.
We're going to Stockton.

51:03.294 --> 51:05.163
Abendsen said
not to kill her.

51:05.230 --> 51:07.398
I don't care
what Abendsen said.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.368
She's seen his face now.

51:11.436 --> 51:13.538
I am not okay with this.

51:13.604 --> 51:16.141
I'm not asking
your permission, Karen.

51:16.207 --> 51:18.143
Since when
did you get so soft?

51:27.452 --> 51:29.320
Sounds like someone's up.

51:37.162 --> 51:39.164
We got to pull over now.

51:43.768 --> 51:44.902
That's Kempeitai.

51:44.969 --> 51:47.305
That's all right.
Just keep moving.

51:49.507 --> 51:50.508
Shit.

52:08.559 --> 52:09.694
TomarÃ©!

52:10.961 --> 52:12.963
TomarÃ©!

52:17.034 --> 52:18.236
TomarÃ©!

52:24.642 --> 52:26.377
Gary--

52:26.444 --> 52:27.412
No.

52:38.389 --> 52:40.491
Gary, stop! Don't!

52:40.558 --> 52:41.592
Aah!

53:00.711 --> 53:01.746
Gary.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.586
Oh, shit. All right. Hold--

53:13.258 --> 53:14.359
Oh.

54:06.110 --> 54:07.144
Gary!

54:09.547 --> 54:10.948
Gary!

54:11.015 --> 54:12.550
We've got to go now!
