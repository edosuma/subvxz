So, Zoey, why don't you tell us
what happened last night?

09:16.730 --> 09:18.514
- [clears throat]

09:18.558 --> 09:21.691
I was acting out
a ravishment fantasy,

09:21.735 --> 09:24.825
pretending a stranger
had broken in.

09:24.868 --> 09:27.001
That's when I saw the comments

09:27.044 --> 09:29.351
saying that someone
was coming in the window.

09:29.394 --> 09:32.310
- So they thought that
it was part of the act?

09:32.354 --> 09:34.486
- It wasn't.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.968
Before I could react,
he was behind me.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.797
Choking me.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.016
I tried to get away.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.409
I screamed, "No!"

09:44.453 --> 09:47.630
And he pulled my nightgown up
and tried to rape me.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.851
He couldn't though.
He used his fingers.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.636
- We saw that he was
wearing a ski mask.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.159
Did you hear his voice?

09:55.203 --> 09:57.292
- He said,

09:57.335 --> 09:58.641
"You know you want it."

09:58.685 --> 10:00.295
Low, like he was disguising it.

10:00.338 --> 10:03.385
- Zoey, do any of your fans
know where you live?

10:03.428 --> 10:04.821
- Absolutely not.

10:04.865 --> 10:07.128
I use wish lists
for deliveries,

10:07.171 --> 10:08.695
never reveal my location.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.566
I'm very safe.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.002
- And I'm sure that you are.

10:12.046 --> 10:15.876
But whoever did this
called you Kendra

10:15.919 --> 10:17.834
and knew that you had

10:17.878 --> 10:21.142
a scheduled
ravishment scenario, right?

10:21.185 --> 10:23.840
- My fans are my friends.

10:23.884 --> 10:26.669
Like, they're nice.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.106
And I would never go private

10:29.150 --> 10:31.152
with someone
that I didn't trust.

10:31.195 --> 10:34.416
- The private sessions--
are you closer with these men?

10:34.459 --> 10:36.940
- Yeah.
It can get very intimate.

10:36.984 --> 10:37.985
- Okay.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.073
So why don't we go
through the list

10:39.116 --> 10:40.857
and see if
we're missing anything.

10:40.901 --> 10:43.860
- So your top customer,
MamasBoy?

10:43.904 --> 10:45.645
- He watches with his wife.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.603
They're trying to get pregnant.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.560
Um...
[clears throat]

10:48.604 --> 10:50.214
TreySlays is a trader.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.173
He's been extremely
stressed with work.

10:52.216 --> 10:55.263
He was caught masturbating
during a work Zoom session.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.568
He's so busy.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.788
He can't even leave
his apartment.

10:58.832 --> 11:02.270
They've all been messaging me
asking if I'm okay.

11:02.313 --> 11:05.186
- So that's why
you shut the room down?

11:16.632 --> 11:18.808

Very.

Good.

- You want me to put on
a nightgown?

<i>- Hey, Liv.
You're gonna wanna see this.</i>

13:13.488 --> 13:15.838

[whispers]
We got him.

13:22.758 --> 13:25.805
- Those photos,
Kendra posed for all of them.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.110
She wanted me to have them.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.720
- Yeah, right.
- Sure.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.897
We're trying to figure out why
she thinks you attacked her.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.333
- I didn't.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.161
That's not what happened.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.771
It was roleplay.
- Roleplay.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.294
- Like we've been doing.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.819
Lately, me and Kendra
have been getting very intense.

13:39.862 --> 13:43.213
- Okay, so you two have
roleplayed in person before?

13:43.257 --> 13:45.346
- No, but it was time.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.217
- It was time?
- We were both ready.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.437
When she said that she wanted
to be ravished,

13:49.480 --> 13:51.743
she looked right at me,
and I know her, her voice.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.180
She wanted it.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.182
- So it was the first time.
- Yes.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.184
- That's why you
couldn't get it up?

13:57.227 --> 13:59.012
- Wait.
Did Kendra tell you that?

13:59.055 --> 14:02.058
- She was just answering
our questions.

14:02.102 --> 14:05.018
So she gave you her address?

14:05.061 --> 14:06.541
- Well, not in so many words.

14:06.584 --> 14:07.847
- Then how'd you know
where she lived?

14:07.890 --> 14:10.066
You stalking her?
- Is that what she's saying?

14:10.110 --> 14:11.720
- She's saying
you tried to rape her.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.287
That's what she's saying.
- Oh, man.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.854
I have to talk to her.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.899
- You wanna take her private?
That's not gonna happen.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.553
- Sergeant, take it easy.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.860
There's clearly some kind
of misunderstanding here.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.514
So why don't you walk us
through how we got here,

14:23.558 --> 14:26.430
and we can clear this all up?

14:31.827 --> 14:34.003
- Uh...

14:34.047 --> 14:37.224
I don't think so.

14:37.267 --> 14:40.227
You do know that
I'm a certified paralegal?

14:40.270 --> 14:41.706
So at this juncture,

14:41.750 --> 14:44.274
I'm going to formally
request representation.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.191
- I don't care
how deluded he is.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.106
That's not a defense.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.238
- I almost feel sorry
for this guy.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.761
- I don't.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.632
- Yeah, well, his side of it,
he's telling the truth.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.156
- About what?

14:56.199 --> 14:57.287
That he didn't rape her?

14:57.331 --> 14:59.550
- Nobody said that.
- No?

14:59.594 --> 15:02.684
So what are you saying, Carisi?

15:02.727 --> 15:05.600
- What I'm saying is they were
in some kind of relationship.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.080
That's how camming works,
right?

15:07.123 --> 15:08.820
That's why the guys keep
coming back to the same girl?

15:08.864 --> 15:10.083
- That's how it all works.

15:10.126 --> 15:13.042
Strippers, escorts--
men start believing 'em.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.870
I mean, guys are fools
or worse.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.090
- And she got on camera
and told her fans

15:17.133 --> 15:18.569
that she wanted somebody
to sneak in,

15:18.613 --> 15:20.267
hold her down, and assault her.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.964
Now we know she
didn't mean that literally,

15:22.008 --> 15:23.574
that she didn't consent to it.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.228
But it could get complicated
for a jury.

15:25.272 --> 15:28.231
- Well, lucky that they have
you to explain the difference

15:28.275 --> 15:31.452
between fantasy and reality,
Counselor.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.628
- And the reality is
that he's a stalker.

15:33.671 --> 15:36.022
- Yeah, and she cams,
mostly undressed

15:36.065 --> 15:37.110
for hundreds of fans
for hours--

15:37.153 --> 15:38.067
- Carisi, how quickly
we switch.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.329
- I'm just showing you

15:39.373 --> 15:41.592
how the defense
is going to play this.

15:43.638 --> 15:46.728
So make sure Zoey
is prepared for that.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.386
<i>- Gabe was one
of my early subscribers.</i>

15:52.429 --> 15:54.736
He was shy at first.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.956
But we ended up camming
every night

15:56.999 --> 15:58.566
when he was working from home.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.307
- He says
you're in a relationship.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.917
- No.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.007
Well, I mean, kind of,
but it's not real.

16:05.051 --> 16:08.358
I mean, we talk all the time,
but it's all virtual.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.360
- So you never told him
where you live, right?

16:10.404 --> 16:11.971
- No.
Never.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.189
- Well, somehow he found you.

16:13.233 --> 16:16.018
Maybe you slipped
during a session?

16:16.062 --> 16:17.193
- I don't see how.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.630
- Zoey, he was stalking you.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.415
He has pictures of you here.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.417
- With my dad?

16:23.460 --> 16:25.245
- Just you out front
on the phone.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.769
- I do cam
from my cell sometimes,

16:27.812 --> 16:29.249
but I'm always
extremely careful

16:29.292 --> 16:31.773
not to have any details
in the frame.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.689
Wait.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.474
- What?

16:37.518 --> 16:39.999
- About six months ago,
I was in a private with Gabe,

16:40.042 --> 16:41.826
and I was really upset.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.351
My dad was sundowning,
and he didn't remember my name.

16:44.394 --> 16:45.700
- And you told Gabe that?

16:45.743 --> 16:47.354
- I said that I probably have
to put my father

16:47.397 --> 16:48.920
in a memory care ward.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.706
Gabe said his law firm did
a lot of elder care cases.

16:51.749 --> 16:54.535
- And he recommended
this place.

16:54.578 --> 16:57.494
- Oh, my God.
I did this.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.062
I let a crazy man into my life,

17:00.106 --> 17:02.412
into my father's life.

17:02.456 --> 17:05.937
I have to go.

17:05.981 --> 17:09.593
He's guilty.

17:09.637 --> 17:12.509
Why do I even have
to take this to trial?

17:12.553 --> 17:15.730
I can't testify in public.

17:21.518 --> 17:22.867
- Okay.
I get it.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.479
No vic wants to testify,
but what are her issues?

17:25.522 --> 17:27.394
- Well, her father is
in a nursing home.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.613
She's in grad school
for social work.

17:29.657 --> 17:33.008
And she volunteers
at a Catholic food bank.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.228
- She doesn't want
the real people in her life

17:35.271 --> 17:36.403
finding out she cams.

17:36.446 --> 17:37.534
- Look--she's afraid of Gabe

17:37.578 --> 17:39.580
for herself, for her father.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.364
- Well, there's
a restraining order in place,

17:41.408 --> 17:43.410
and we could put a squad car
around the block?

17:43.453 --> 17:45.020
Her story seems solid?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.109
- Yes.
Definitely.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.632
Look.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.765
This was an unwanted assault.

17:50.808 --> 17:54.116
Any consent was in Gabe's mind.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.248
- [sighs]
Okay.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.727
But if she won't take
the stand,

17:56.771 --> 17:58.425
I can't take this to trial.

17:58.468 --> 18:01.776
- So play hardball on a deal.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.127
- I don't know why
Zoey's saying these things.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.259
We are in love.

18:06.302 --> 18:08.696
- Gabe, please.
Attempted rape?

18:08.739 --> 18:10.480
It was consensual,
and there was no penetration.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.134
- Why does everyone
keep saying that?

18:12.178 --> 18:13.962
- Maybe I can go down.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.225
Aggravated sexual abuse
in the first degree.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.792
- A felony.

18:17.835 --> 18:18.967
No chance.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.447
We might consider
forcible touching.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.144
- A class A misdemeanor?
No chance.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.059
- This girl cammed that
she wanted to be overpowered,

18:24.103 --> 18:25.321
told her fans
when it was going to happen,

18:25.365 --> 18:26.496
charged them to watch.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.455
That's a lot for a jury
to absorb.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.283
- Well, Zoey's
a very sympathetic witness.

18:30.326 --> 18:31.632
And these days, victim blaming?

18:31.675 --> 18:32.807
Good luck.
- No, no.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.069
We have no intention
of doing that.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.984
- Lowest I can go.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.160
Aggravated sexual abuse
in the third.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.031
He'll be back
to his cam sessions in a year.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.468
- I didn't abuse her.

18:41.511 --> 18:44.035
- Gabe, please.
It's a fair offer.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.648
Give me a few minutes
with my client.

18:47.691 --> 18:50.041
- Are you kidding me?

18:52.435 --> 18:55.308
- Aggravated sexual abuse
in the third degree.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.179
How do you plead?
- Guilty.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.354
- People on bail?
- Hold up.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.182
I'm not--I'm not guilty
of abuse.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.662
- Gabe.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.185
- Well, which is it,
Counselor?

19:03.229 --> 19:05.579
- The only thing I'm guilty of
is loving Zoey Carrera.

19:05.622 --> 19:08.495
- We had a deal in place.
- Maybe you two do.

19:08.538 --> 19:09.409
- This is the first
I'm hearing of this.

19:09.452 --> 19:10.758
- And the last.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.673
I'm firing you,
and I'm representing myself.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.065
I'm a trained paralegal,
Your Honor.

19:14.109 --> 19:16.242
- Even so, I would advise
against it, Mr. Miller.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.592
However, that is your right.

19:18.635 --> 19:21.203
And I am ordering Ms. Myerson
to stay on as co-counsel.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.423
People on bail.
- Remand.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.294
The defendant has been
stalking his victim.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.427
- I'll stay away.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.863
Last thing I wanna do
is upset her.

19:28.906 --> 19:31.561
- Mr. Miller,
I'll release you R.O.R.

19:31.605 --> 19:32.649
But if you violate
your restraining order,

19:32.693 --> 19:33.694
I will remand you.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.826
- As you should, sir.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.219
- This matter is adjourned.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.221
Case is set over for trial.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.528
- He's gonna be his own lawyer?

19:41.571 --> 19:44.618
Can he even do that?
- I'm sorry, Zoey.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.228
- I gave him a better deal
than he deserves.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.360
His lawyer knew it.

19:47.403 --> 19:48.230
I don't know
what this guy wants.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.536
- I do.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.320
He wants her.

19:51.364 --> 19:56.760

20:02.984 --> 20:05.552
- Carisi, you're really
just gonna let this happen?

20:05.595 --> 20:07.249
- Good morning to you too, Kat.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.208
How are you doing?
- Not great.

20:09.251 --> 20:12.080
It's bad enough Gabe is allowed
to represent himself in court,

20:12.123 --> 20:13.603
but now he gets to go
to her apartment?

20:13.647 --> 20:16.084
- Well, it is the crime scene,
and as of last January,

20:16.127 --> 20:18.347
the defense and the defendant
are allowed to examine it.

20:18.391 --> 20:21.437
- Just so you know,
Zoey is completely freaked out.

20:21.481 --> 20:22.786
- I understand that.
I don't blame her.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.266
- She's insisting
on being there.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.747
- That's not a good idea
but that's really up to her.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.227
- Well, is anything up to us?

20:28.270 --> 20:30.098
I mean, is there anything
that you can do?

20:30.141 --> 20:32.274
- Do you mean I am able
to change a state law

20:32.318 --> 20:33.406
in the next hour?

20:33.449 --> 20:35.495
No.
- It's not fair.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.323
Aren't you supposed
to protect the victim?

20:37.366 --> 20:40.326
- Actually, my job is
to uphold the law.

20:42.328 --> 20:45.113
Is there a reason
that you don't like me?

20:45.156 --> 20:47.463
- I just can't believe
that you were ever a cop.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.989
- Well, I'm due at Zoey's.
- Well, I'm coming with you.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.295
- This day just keeps
getting better.

20:53.339 --> 20:56.429
Mask up.
We're taking the subway.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.169
- I came in
through this window.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.997
I'd like to point out
that she left it open.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.522
Then I walked past this table
with the toys.

21:02.565 --> 21:05.612
- Explain to me how
is he allowed in my apartment.

21:05.655 --> 21:06.830
- New discovery laws.

21:06.874 --> 21:09.224
The defendant can examine
the crime scene.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.704
- You don't have to be here,
Zoey.

21:10.747 --> 21:11.922
We'll stay.
- I'm not leaving.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.229
- Wow.
You kept this.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.535
Do you remember
when I bought this for you

21:15.578 --> 21:17.319
for our private session
on your birthday?

21:17.363 --> 21:19.147
- Beyond the scope.
Counselor, control your client.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.192
- Sorry, Zoey.
I overstepped, sorry.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.064
- Gabe, I think we have
everything we need.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.849
- I reserve the right
to come back.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.590
Okay.

21:27.634 --> 21:28.896
Bye, Zoey.

21:28.939 --> 21:31.333
See you in court.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.335
- Gabe, let's go.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.728
[door clicks]

21:34.771 --> 21:36.947
- "Discovery"?
That's bull.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.427
He's getting off on this.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.560
He can't wait
to cross-examine me,

21:40.603 --> 21:41.996
make me say whatever he wants.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.650
I can't do this.

21:43.693 --> 21:47.044
- Zoey, his defense
is that it was consensual.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.177
If you don't testify,
then he gets away with rape.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.265
- Yeah, the judge
will make sure

21:50.309 --> 21:51.875
that he doesn't get
out of line.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.008
If he tries anything, he'll be
held in immediate contempt.

21:54.051 --> 21:56.402
- [exhales]

21:56.445 --> 21:59.535
- I hate this new law.
I hate it.

21:59.579 --> 22:01.407
How is Zoey holding up?

22:01.450 --> 22:03.060
- She's furious at Gabe.

22:03.104 --> 22:04.975
She's worried that
the jury's gonna judge her

22:05.019 --> 22:06.107
for being a cam girl.

22:06.150 --> 22:07.674
- She's right, and they will.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.153
- [sighs]

22:09.197 --> 22:10.590
The whole point of camming

22:10.633 --> 22:12.592
is that the woman
controls the narrative.

22:12.635 --> 22:15.812
No physical contact,
no STDs, no violence.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.118
It's supposed to be empowering.

22:17.161 --> 22:19.381
- But it doesn't make it safe.

22:19.425 --> 22:22.036
- When you say that, it sounds
like you're victim blaming.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.038
- Kat, it's not victim blaming.
It's just--

22:24.081 --> 22:25.996
<i>[phone vibrating]</i>

22:26.040 --> 22:28.259
- Listen--from what Captain
and I have seen,

22:28.303 --> 22:31.393
sex work is far more dangerous
than people wanna believe.

22:31.437 --> 22:34.091
- Carisi says the jury
has been selected,

22:34.135 --> 22:37.573
and Gabe chose
mostly older women.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.923
- Who are gonna judge her
for being a cam girl.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.928
<i>- I could just tell
this guy in a mask</i>

22:44.972 --> 22:46.713
wasn't part of her cam show.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.715
She was screaming, crying.

22:48.758 --> 22:50.151
This was a rape.

22:50.194 --> 22:51.674
- Did you call the cops?

22:51.718 --> 22:53.328
- I videoed it on my phone.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.765
And the next day, I brought it
in to Manhattan SVU.

22:55.809 --> 22:58.289
- Thank you.

23:07.908 --> 23:10.084
- Larry, right?

23:10.127 --> 23:12.913
But your username
on the cam site is?

23:12.956 --> 23:14.958
- TenInchNail.
- Right.

23:15.002 --> 23:17.396
So we already know
that you exaggerate.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.136
- Objection.
Is there a question here?

23:19.180 --> 23:22.270
- Mr. Miller.

23:22.313 --> 23:24.054
- Larry, was that night
the first time

23:24.098 --> 23:25.926
that you watched Kendra--
oh, sorry--

23:25.969 --> 23:28.450
Zoey give a webcam performance?

23:28.494 --> 23:29.538
- No.

23:29.582 --> 23:30.974
- How about the first time
that day?

23:31.018 --> 23:32.323
- I'd seen her several times
that day.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.064
- What were
those earlier sessions about?

23:34.108 --> 23:35.588
- She was telling her fans

23:35.631 --> 23:38.112
that she wanted them to watch
her that night and tip up.

23:38.155 --> 23:40.027
- Watch her do what?

23:40.070 --> 23:42.421
- Enact a fantasy
of a masked stranger

23:42.464 --> 23:44.640
breaking in
and forcing himself on her.

23:44.684 --> 23:45.946
- Yeah, didn't wanna miss that,
did you?

23:45.989 --> 23:46.990
- Your Honor.
- Rephrase.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.209
Did you watch the whole show?

23:48.252 --> 23:49.297
- It was an assault.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.603
- What were you doing

23:50.646 --> 23:52.648
while you were watching
the alleged assault?

23:52.692 --> 23:54.128
- Um...

23:54.171 --> 23:56.260
- Were you masturbating?
- Objection.

23:56.304 --> 23:59.089
- I'll allow.
- Maybe.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.439
- Maybe?
[laughs]

24:00.482 --> 24:02.179
- Until I realize
it wasn't what she wanted.

24:02.223 --> 24:03.398
- Did you come first
and then realize that--

24:03.442 --> 24:04.530
- Your Honor!
- Withdrawn.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.314
Nothing further.

24:09.622 --> 24:12.625
- Would I say that Gabe Miller
is a frequent customer?

24:12.668 --> 24:13.887
Yes, I would.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.323
- And by that, do you mean
that he follows

24:15.366 --> 24:16.890
a lot of different
cam performers?

24:16.933 --> 24:18.239
- No.
Just one.

24:18.282 --> 24:20.676
- And who is that?
- Zoey Carrera.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.853
We refer to him
as a monogamous user.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.420
- You mean obsessive?

24:25.464 --> 24:27.074
- Objection.
Leading.

24:27.117 --> 24:28.336
- Sustained.

24:28.379 --> 24:29.990
- How would you
characterize his usage

24:30.033 --> 24:31.295
as compared to others?

24:31.339 --> 24:32.732
- If there's a bell curve,

24:32.775 --> 24:35.648
he's on the high usage
far end of it.

24:35.691 --> 24:38.215
- And how do you know that?
- Cookies.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.261
We track usage.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.959
When a viewer tips
or takes a girl private,

24:43.003 --> 24:45.005
we monetize that
via his credit card.

24:45.048 --> 24:48.008
- Is there anything else that
would distinguish Mr. Miller

24:48.051 --> 24:49.183
from the other customers?

24:49.226 --> 24:50.706
- Actually, yes.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.622
He contacted our site
for Zoey's address.

24:53.666 --> 24:56.320
Wanted to send her
chocolates and flowers.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.279
So we forwarded him

24:58.322 --> 25:00.629
her Amazon Wish List.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.762
These interactions are virtual.

25:02.805 --> 25:05.808
There's no physical contact.
Our viewers know this.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.854
- Thank you.

25:07.897 --> 25:09.203
- So, Mr. Cougat,

25:09.246 --> 25:12.032
you characterized Gabe Miller
as monogamous.

25:12.075 --> 25:14.382
- Yes.
- How about loyal?

25:14.425 --> 25:16.210
- I guess you could say that.

25:16.253 --> 25:19.256
- And generous,
sending flowers, chocolate?

25:19.300 --> 25:22.042
Things Ms. Carrera
told him she enjoys.

25:22.085 --> 25:23.696
- I suppose so.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.698
- You suppose?

watched her cam?

25:34.445 --> 25:36.143
- I can't say that I have.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.406
- So if she were in a special
relationship with someone,

25:38.449 --> 25:40.495
you would have no way
of knowing that.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.366
She's just an independent

26:02.909 --> 26:05.564
- Gabe just showed up
and talked his way in.

26:05.607 --> 26:06.652
- He told the staff
he's a visitor.

26:06.695 --> 26:07.870
He's with my father.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.491
- What else is camming about?

27:47.535 --> 27:49.711
- It's a community.

Most of my fans just like
hanging out and talking.

are sexual?

28:00.200 --> 28:02.724

- On what grounds, Mr. Miller?

28:02.768 --> 28:05.422

that I want to.

28:16.129 --> 28:18.435
even if somebody requested it,

28:18.479 --> 28:20.307
you would never cam
with somebody else in the room?

28:20.350 --> 28:21.830
- No.
Never.

28:23.919 --> 28:26.966

important boundary.

28:30.926 --> 28:33.102

Mr. Miller.

about the sexual role-play

29:30.377 --> 29:32.335

engaged in.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.990

The markets close,
I pop a beer,

36:29.187 --> 36:30.318
and I party with Kendra.

36:30.362 --> 36:33.060
She's like my best friend
with benefits.

36:33.103 --> 36:36.019
- Have you ever tried
to contact her in person?

36:36.063 --> 36:38.152
- Not in a million years.
- Your best friend?

36:38.196 --> 36:40.285
What--are you gonna say
that she loves you too now?

36:40.328 --> 36:43.462
- Mr. Miller, you'll have your
turn to question the witness.

36:43.505 --> 36:46.160
- Can I answer?

36:46.204 --> 36:49.250
If I pay her to say
she loves me, she'll say it.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.818
It's the deal, man.

36:51.861 --> 36:55.300
- Mr. Carisi, are you done
questioning this witness?

36:55.343 --> 36:57.824
- People rest, Your Honor.

37:00.043 --> 37:02.524
- Mr. Miller.
- No questions, Your Honor.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.352
But at this time,
I recall Zoey Carrera.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.876
- Objection.
- Approach.

37:09.052 --> 37:11.664
- Mr. Miller has already had
his chance to cross.

37:11.707 --> 37:12.839
This is just harassment.

37:12.882 --> 37:13.970
- I have a new line
of questioning.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.102
- [scoffs]

37:15.145 --> 37:16.364
- He's within his rights,
Your Honor.

37:16.408 --> 37:17.800
- I'll need to see a proffer,

37:17.844 --> 37:20.281
exactly what you plan
on asking this witness.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.022
And if I do agree,

37:22.065 --> 37:24.329
you will have very narrow
parameters, Mr. Miller.

37:24.372 --> 37:26.896
Violate them, I will hold you
in contempt.

37:30.378 --> 37:31.727
- What the hell, Carisi?

37:31.771 --> 37:33.338
I told Zoey she wouldn't have
to testify again.

37:33.381 --> 37:34.730
- Yeah, well, you shouldn't
have done that.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.297
- Helpful.
What do I tell her now?

37:36.341 --> 37:38.430
- You tell her that
this is the opposite

37:38.473 --> 37:39.822
of a camming session.

37:39.866 --> 37:42.695
Whatever he wants,
she doesn't give it to him.

37:46.568 --> 37:49.310
- I'm sorry, Ms. Carrera.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.399
I know that you don't wanna
come back up here.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.096
- You subpoenaed me.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.925
- I'm sorry about that too,
but it's the law.

37:55.969 --> 37:57.492
- Is there a question here?

37:57.536 --> 37:59.277
- You've been warned,
Mr. Miller.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.191
- Copy that, Your Honor.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.629
Ms. Carrera,

38:03.672 --> 38:06.588
did you tell Larry Hughes
that you loved him?

38:06.632 --> 38:09.591
- I did.

38:09.635 --> 38:12.768
- Defense exhibit ten.

38:12.812 --> 38:15.031
Would you please read that
out loud for the court?

38:15.075 --> 38:18.861
- "I heart you, TenInchNail."

38:18.905 --> 38:21.908
- And by "heart,"
you mean "love"?

38:21.951 --> 38:24.258
- Your Honor.
- Move on, Mr. Miller.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.564
- [huffs]

38:25.607 --> 38:26.826
In the interest of moving on,

38:26.869 --> 38:29.698
let's skip
to defense exhibit 22.

38:29.742 --> 38:32.962
Would you please read that out
loud to the court, Ms. Carrera?

38:39.621 --> 38:41.014
- I'm not reading that.

38:41.057 --> 38:42.581
- Okay.
Let me help you out.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.061
It says,
"Out of all my cam friends,

38:45.105 --> 38:48.021
you're the only one
I really love, Gabe."

38:48.064 --> 38:51.503
Doesn't it?
- Yes.

38:51.546 --> 38:54.462
- Again, I would just ask you
to read that out loud.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.159
- I don't want to.

38:56.203 --> 38:57.335
- You have to.

38:57.378 --> 38:58.684
I can ask you any question
that I want.

38:58.727 --> 38:59.728
Isn't that right, Your Honor?

38:59.772 --> 39:01.948
- No.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.819
I'm not going to do that.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.517
- Judge, tell her.
She's my witness.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.257
- Mr. Miller.
- Just say it.

39:07.301 --> 39:09.390
Say, "I love you.
I love you the most, Gabe."

39:09.434 --> 39:10.696
- No!

39:10.739 --> 39:11.610
- Judge, tell her
to answer my question

39:11.653 --> 39:12.785
or hold her in contempt.

39:12.828 --> 39:14.134
- Mr. Miller!
- You have to, Kendra.

39:14.177 --> 39:15.396
You have to.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.745

you do it.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.443

the things I'm asking you?

39:19.966 --> 39:21.097
- Bailiffs!
- Seriously?

39:21.141 --> 39:22.664
- Your Honor!
- I'm right here.

39:22.708 --> 39:23.970
Why aren't you doing
what I ask, Kendra?

39:24.013 --> 39:25.101
- Take him out of here.

39:25.145 --> 39:26.320
- What happened?
Why, Kendra?

39:26.364 --> 39:27.277
- I'm not Kendra!

39:27.321 --> 39:28.801
- Tell them you love me please.

39:28.844 --> 39:30.672
- Order, order!
- There is no Kendra!

39:30.716 --> 39:31.978
I'm Zoey, and you raped me!

39:32.021 --> 39:33.893
That's the last thing
that I wanted.

39:33.936 --> 39:35.416
- No, don't--don't say that,
Kendra, don't say that.
