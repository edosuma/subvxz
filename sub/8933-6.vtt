WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:01.968
This is

00:01.968 --> 00:03.737
the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.872
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.176
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.978
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.880 --> 00:15.382
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.383 --> 00:17.417
Yikes!

00:18.218 --> 00:19.319
Yaaaah...

00:22.222 --> 00:23.523
Yeaaaah!

00:23.523 --> 00:26.559
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.302
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.937 --> 00:39.272
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.876 --> 00:45.178
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.912 --> 00:47.547
the Raccoons!!

00:47.547 --> 00:47.614
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:02.095 --> 01:04.798
As the years go by,
things from the past

01:04.798 --> 01:06.599
can take on new meaning.

01:06.599 --> 01:09.202
An old sweater becomes
more comfortable.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.304
Old friends become more special.

01:11.304 --> 01:14.974
But for Cyril Sneer, the most
important thing is,

01:14.974 --> 01:18.178
old things often become
more valuable.

01:18.178 --> 01:21.681
Wow!
It's beautiful, Pop!

01:21.681 --> 01:23.283
Of course it is!

01:23.283 --> 01:25.485
I paid $500,000 for it.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.822
And just what are you
planning to do

01:28.822 --> 01:30.657
with that electric powder puff!?

01:30.657 --> 01:33.927
Pig 3: Er..I was going
to buff the car, Sir.

01:33.927 --> 01:34.928
With that!?

01:34.928 --> 01:37.130
Why don't you just take a
sledgehammer to it!

01:37.130 --> 01:39.799
Don't you understand
what I've got here!?

01:39.799 --> 01:41.935
This is a Clarence Cyclone!

01:41.935 --> 01:44.070
A masterwork of engineering!

01:44.070 --> 01:45.805
It's a piece of automotive art!

01:45.805 --> 01:47.974
There's only three
left in the world!

01:47.974 --> 01:49.175
Pig 3: Ooh!!

01:49.175 --> 01:50.677
Oww!!

01:50.677 --> 01:53.680
Three! Gee Pop,
you should be a shoo-in

01:53.680 --> 01:56.249
to win first prize at
Lady Baden Baden's

01:56.249 --> 01:58.017
antique car show.

01:58.017 --> 01:59.352
I'm counting on it!

01:59.352 --> 02:03.356
And the $100,000 first prize
is only the beginning.

02:03.356 --> 02:07.160
I'll enter this baby in antique
car shows around the world!

02:07.160 --> 02:09.362
I stand to make
a fortune on this!

02:12.132 --> 02:13.900
We'll get it, boss!

02:20.073 --> 02:22.108
Mrs. Pig: Well, I suppose

02:22.108 --> 02:25.178
I was very lucky my car
broke down where it did.

02:25.178 --> 02:27.680
If you and your friend
hadn't been there to help,

02:27.680 --> 02:29.382
I don't know what I'd have done.

02:29.382 --> 02:31.017
Aw, it was our pleasure!

02:31.017 --> 02:33.353
And don't worry about your car.

02:33.353 --> 02:36.156
Schaeffer and I will have it
running again in no time.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.757
He and I are what you call,

02:37.757 --> 02:39.893
whizzes in the
mechanical field.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.031
Pig 1: All right! Cool it!
We're coming!

02:45.031 --> 02:46.633
Pig 2: Well,
have you figured out

02:46.633 --> 02:48.268
how the door bell works,

02:48.268 --> 02:50.270
or do you need more practice?

02:50.270 --> 02:51.871
Mrs. Pig: Surprise!

02:52.672 --> 02:55.275
Mom!?
Mom!?

02:58.144 --> 02:59.846
Look at that engine.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.882
The block's cracked,
the radiator's leaking

03:02.882 --> 03:04.717
and the pistons are hanging out.

03:04.717 --> 03:06.653
Boy, it's
a wreck, all right.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.222
I don't see how
Mrs. Pig got it this far.

03:09.222 --> 03:11.024
Ugh?!

03:11.024 --> 03:15.061
Yeah, she did come
a long way to see her sons.

03:16.095 --> 03:18.298
Boy were those three surprised.

03:18.298 --> 03:21.100
First time I've
seen them speechless.

03:22.302 --> 03:23.937
It was nice.

03:26.906 --> 03:28.474
Bert/Schaeffer: Uh, huh, oh!

03:31.311 --> 03:33.079
Mrs. Pig: This house
is even bigger

03:33.079 --> 03:35.548
than I imagined
from your letters.

03:35.548 --> 03:39.886
Oh, you boys have done
so well for yourselves!

03:39.886 --> 03:41.354
Now...

03:41.354 --> 03:43.756
tell me all about
your life here.

03:43.756 --> 03:48.428
It must be so exciting being
important leaders of business!

03:48.428 --> 03:50.263
Pigs!
Where are you hiding,

03:50.263 --> 03:52.532
you lazy loin chops?!

03:52.532 --> 03:54.934
Pick up the phone, right now!!

03:54.934 --> 03:57.036
Mrs. Pig: Who in
heaven's name is
that?!

03:57.036 --> 04:01.808
Pig 2: Oh, that's.. ah...
one of our employees.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.810
Yes, Cyril Sneer.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.179
Remember, we wrote
you about him?

04:06.179 --> 04:09.882
I'll, er, heh-heh just
see what he wants now.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.487
Yes? Um hummm.

04:14.487 --> 04:17.957
Yes! Sure! Yes.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.959
Now get it done, pronto!

04:19.959 --> 04:22.362
And don't let me
catch you napping!

04:23.963 --> 04:26.032
Pig 2: I want it done pronto!

04:26.032 --> 04:28.801
And don't let me
catch you napping!

04:30.470 --> 04:31.838
Sorry about this mom.

04:31.838 --> 04:37.043
We, um, left Cyril in charge
of a big.. uh.. merger!

04:37.043 --> 04:41.781
Pig 1: Yeah! There's millions to
be made in, in merging things.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.816
Mrs. Pig:
I understand perfectly boys.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.718
When you're all done merging,

04:45.718 --> 04:47.787
why not bring Mr. Sneer around?

04:47.787 --> 04:49.689
I'd love to meet him.

04:49.689 --> 04:53.026
Pig 1: Um.. we would, but
we're sending him to, um...

04:53.026 --> 04:55.595
to Moosejaw... right away!

04:55.595 --> 04:58.031
Big conference in Moosejaw.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.234
Pig 3: Merger! Hah!

05:01.234 --> 05:04.771
Some rich, successful
tycoons we are!

05:04.771 --> 05:08.241
Pig 1: Climbing the
ladder of success! Ha!

05:08.241 --> 05:11.110
Pig 2: Bright lights
of industry! Ha!

05:11.110 --> 05:14.347
Pig 1: We can't tell mom
we just work for the boss!!

05:14.347 --> 05:15.848
Mrs. Pig: Oh, yoohoo!

05:15.848 --> 05:18.384
Pig 1: Uhh.

05:18.384 --> 05:21.154
Pig 3: Ohhh, it'll
break her heart

05:21.154 --> 05:24.257
if she finds out we're
dismal failures.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.759
Pig 2: That's not all
that'll get broken,

05:26.759 --> 05:30.163
if the boss finds out
he's working for us now.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.664
I've looked everywhere

05:31.664 --> 05:33.766
for my old set of
driving goggles,

05:33.766 --> 05:35.535
and that great leather helmet.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.270
I think,
they're in the closet

05:37.270 --> 05:39.105
in the spare bedroom, Pop.

05:39.105 --> 05:42.008
I want to look authentic
for this antique car show,

05:42.008 --> 05:44.344
not to mention dashing,

05:44.344 --> 05:46.446
debonair and suave!

05:46.446 --> 05:48.781
Pig 1: W-what do you
want in there, boss?!

05:48.781 --> 05:50.616
Pig 2:
We'll get it.

05:50.616 --> 05:53.653
Pig 3: It's no problem.
We'll be happy to get it!

05:53.653 --> 05:56.255
You morons don't even
know what I want, yet.

05:56.255 --> 05:57.757
Pig 3: W-w-w-whatever!

05:57.757 --> 06:00.159
Are you trying to
hide something from me?

06:00.159 --> 06:02.161
Who?? Us??

06:02.161 --> 06:05.531
Open that door!!
Yes, sir.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.737
Here they are, Pop.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.238
Out of my way, pigs!

06:17.877 --> 06:19.779
Mrs. Pig: I thought,
I heard voices.

06:19.779 --> 06:22.682
It's just beautiful
on the balcony.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.684
What a lovely view!

06:24.684 --> 06:28.454
And it's all yours,
as far as the eye can see.

06:28.454 --> 06:31.457
I'm so very proud of you.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.159
Pheeeew!

06:36.562 --> 06:39.532
Well,
it's running. Barely.

06:39.532 --> 06:42.235
Wow! Where'd you
get that old beauty?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.603
It's Mrs. Pig's.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.938
She's up at the mansion
visiting her boys.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.740
We said we'd fix it up for her.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.842
They sure don't
make 'em like this anymore!

06:49.842 --> 06:51.411
What a classic!

06:51.411 --> 06:53.479
Uh, what make is it anyway?

06:53.479 --> 06:57.617
This? Why, it's a.. a...

06:57.617 --> 06:58.985
Gosh, I don't know.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.586
I'll see,
if I can find out.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.621
Okay, Ralph.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.523
We're going to take
her for a test run.

07:03.523 --> 07:06.626
By the sound of it,
more like a test lurch.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.365
Mrs. Pig: Oh yes,
it was quite a trip!

07:12.365 --> 07:15.301
And then my poor
old car broke down.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.970
But that nice raccoon
and his friend

07:17.970 --> 07:20.072
took care of everything.

07:20.072 --> 07:22.542
You boys don't look so well.

07:22.542 --> 07:23.843
Is something wrong?

07:23.843 --> 07:25.978
You're not working
too hard, are you?

07:25.978 --> 07:27.447
Pig 1: Uh, no...

07:27.447 --> 07:30.616
I think, we might be
coming down with something.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.819
Pig 3: Probably swine flu mom,

07:32.819 --> 07:35.154
there's a lot of
it going around.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.056
Mrs. Pig: Oh my!

07:37.056 --> 07:39.158
Well, just leave it to me.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.394
I've got the very thing.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.198
What are you
three doing up there?!

07:45.198 --> 07:47.667
The love scene from
Romeo and Juliet?!

07:47.667 --> 07:50.002
Pig 2: Oh!
Ehhh, no, sir.

07:50.002 --> 07:53.039
Pig 1: We're.. um...
cleaning the balcony, sir.

07:53.039 --> 07:57.009
Pig 3: Nothing could be worse
than a dirty balcony, Sir.

07:57.009 --> 07:59.912
They should give their
brains a good cleaning.

07:59.912 --> 08:01.581
Pig 3: Uh. He's gone.

08:01.581 --> 08:03.950
Mrs. Pig: What are you boys
doing down there?

08:03.950 --> 08:08.321
Pig 2: Um.. just inspecting our
new imported Italian tiles.

08:09.589 --> 08:12.792
Didn't Cyril do a good job
installing them?

08:12.792 --> 08:14.494
Pig 3: Exquisite.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.029
Maybe he deserves a raise.

08:17.029 --> 08:18.764
Mrs. Pig: That's my boys.

08:18.764 --> 08:20.733
Always thoughtful.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.402
And I thought you
might like these.

08:23.402 --> 08:25.538
They should keep
you nice and warm.

08:25.538 --> 08:29.041
Pig 2: Wow, thanks mom!

08:29.041 --> 08:31.043
Pig 1: Ah, oh, ya, haha, oh ya.

08:31.043 --> 08:33.145
T-th-they're great.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.615
Mrs. Pig: Boys, I
suppose you're wondering

08:35.615 --> 08:37.583
why I arrived like this,

08:37.583 --> 08:38.885
without any warning.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.754
The fact it, I need your help.

08:41.754 --> 08:44.056
Anything, mom!

08:44.056 --> 08:46.225
Mr. Pig: I've been trying to
think of an easy way

08:46.225 --> 08:48.628
to tell you this,
but there isn't one.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.364
The house.. our house...

08:51.364 --> 08:52.965
is gone.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.134
There was a
hurricane, and, well,

08:55.134 --> 08:57.770
everything is gone. Everything.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.772
Oh, mom!

08:59.772 --> 09:01.007
Mrs. Pig:

09:01.007 --> 09:04.877
And I, I don't have the
money to rebuild our home,

09:04.877 --> 09:08.581
and I know, that you boys are
rich and successful tycoons,

09:08.581 --> 09:10.983
so, I came to you for help.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.085
You will help, won't you?

09:13.085 --> 09:15.454
Pig 1: Of course we will, mom.

09:15.454 --> 09:19.825
Everything we have is yours!

09:19.825 --> 09:23.496
Pig 2:
Ya, everything.

09:25.031 --> 09:25.431
Listen to that

09:25.431 --> 09:27.166
Listen to
that engine, boys.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.068
Sounds like a million bucks!

09:29.068 --> 09:31.203
This baby'll win first prize

09:31.203 --> 09:33.573
in the antique car
show hands down!

09:34.774 --> 09:36.742
A hundred thousand bucks!

09:36.742 --> 09:38.744
I can almost taste it.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.914
Yeah. Just great, boss.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.183
What are you three so
down in the mouth about?

09:44.183 --> 09:45.785
You look like you lost the key

09:45.785 --> 09:47.587
to your safety deposit box.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.790
Pig 1: I wish,
it was that simple.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.491
Great galloping gossip!

09:52.491 --> 09:54.026
Where did they get that!

09:54.026 --> 09:55.194
Blast!!

09:55.194 --> 09:57.430
Those raccoons are
going to enter it

09:57.430 --> 09:59.065
in the antique car show!

09:59.065 --> 10:00.666
Why else would they have it?

10:00.666 --> 10:02.802
I want them.. stopped!

10:04.370 --> 10:06.672
Pig 2: But, boss!
It's just an old wreck.

10:06.672 --> 10:09.275
Yeah, well I'm
not taking any chances!

10:09.275 --> 10:11.978
I intend to win
that first prize!

10:11.978 --> 10:14.880
Now get out there
and get me that car!

10:14.880 --> 10:16.215
Pig 1: But, boss, we don't...

10:16.215 --> 10:18.985
I don't want to hear any
of your lily-livered excuses.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.553
I'm going for a spin,

10:20.553 --> 10:22.221
and when I get back
to the mansion,

10:22.221 --> 10:26.025
I expect to see that heap
safely stashed in my garage!!!

10:27.660 --> 10:29.328
Pig 2: But that's mom's car!

10:29.328 --> 10:31.163
We can't give it to the boss!

10:31.163 --> 10:33.532
Pig 3: Oh oh!
What do we do?

10:33.532 --> 10:35.801
Pig 1: We can't keep
this up much longer.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.870
We'll have to tell
him the truth!

10:37.870 --> 10:42.141
Pig 3: But we've
never done that before!

10:42.141 --> 10:44.844
Pig 1: There's always a
first time for everything.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.379
The worst part is,

10:46.379 --> 10:48.347
we still haven't
figured out a way

10:48.347 --> 10:50.249
to get the money mom needs.

10:50.249 --> 10:52.752
Things can't get any worse.

10:53.552 --> 10:56.422
Uh, without
being too humble,

10:56.422 --> 10:59.859
I think we've done a
brilliant job, Schaeffer.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.762
Not bad,
Bert. Not bad at all.

11:02.762 --> 11:06.432
Well, let's gas it up and
take it back to Mrs. Pig.

11:07.199 --> 11:10.870
Mrs. Pig:
Chocolate brownies.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.272
Just the way the boys like them.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.374
Hmmmm???

11:16.976 --> 11:18.577
Mrs. Pig: Well, hello, Bert.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.746
Hi, Mrs. Pig.

11:20.746 --> 11:24.583
Well, there it is,
running like a charm,

11:24.583 --> 11:26.719
just like we promised.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.788
Mrs. Pig: Oh, Bert!

11:28.788 --> 11:31.724
Schaeffer! You're wonderful.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.927
It would have cost a
fortune to fix in a garage.

11:34.927 --> 11:38.097
There must be some way
I can repay you?

11:40.933 --> 11:43.269
Mrs. Pig: Oh, would you and
Schaeffer care for some

11:43.269 --> 11:45.404
just-made chocolate brownies?

11:45.404 --> 11:47.173
Ha ha! Would we?!

11:47.173 --> 11:48.808
Mrs. Pig: Coming right up.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.243
I'll just put
the car in the garage for you.

11:53.479 --> 11:56.082
Wow! Thanks Mrs. Pig!

11:56.082 --> 11:59.418
Hey, if there are any problems,
just give us a call.

12:01.320 --> 12:05.958
Pig 1: Okay, let's rehearse
this one more time.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.661
Pig 2: W-we couldn't
get the car,

12:08.661 --> 12:10.796
because it belongs
to our mother.

12:11.797 --> 12:12.998
Uaaaah!

12:19.004 --> 12:21.640
Well?
Did you get
that car?

12:21.640 --> 12:25.611
Pig 1: Um.. we wanted to talk
to you about that, boss.

12:25.611 --> 12:26.712
Fine, fine.

12:26.712 --> 12:29.515
But don't just hang
there like lumps of lard!

12:29.515 --> 12:30.583
Close the doors.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.320
Pig 2: (chuckles) We
had a little difficulty.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.256
Yes, the truth is, boss, uh...

12:37.256 --> 12:38.858
Pig 1: Well, the real truth is...

12:38.858 --> 12:40.726
I men the real truth is...

12:40.726 --> 12:43.763
Great work, boys!
The car!!!

12:43.763 --> 12:45.631
Ahhhh!!

12:45.631 --> 12:47.166
Ahh!! Squeak!!! Owww!!!

12:47.166 --> 12:49.168
I don't know
how you got that wreck

12:49.168 --> 12:51.504
away form the Raccoons so fast.

12:51.504 --> 12:55.040
Pig 3: He! Neither do we.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.542
So, how much
did it cost me?

12:56.542 --> 12:58.210
Pig 2: Um, nothing.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.946
Well, I couldn't
ask for a better price.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.849
Remind me to give
you boys a bonus.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.986
Pig 1: Well, seeing as you
brought it up, boss.

13:06.986 --> 13:09.355
Pig 2: Yeah,
we were wondering,

13:09.355 --> 13:12.158
if we could have an
advance on our salary.

13:12.158 --> 13:15.961
We need it for...
personal reasons.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.197
Sure.
Here's 50 cents.

13:18.197 --> 13:19.565
Enjoy!

13:20.800 --> 13:24.003
Pig 1: We were thinking of
something more substantial.

13:24.003 --> 13:26.639
Like about a 50-year advance.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.308
Uh?! See!?
That's what happens

13:29.308 --> 13:33.012
when you try to show a little
kindness to your employees.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.747
They take advantage of you!

13:34.747 --> 13:37.683
Pig 2: Ooh! It's hopeless.

13:37.683 --> 13:39.552
We'll never raise the money

13:39.552 --> 13:42.154
mom needs to rebuild her house.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.361
Bert! Schaeffer!

13:49.361 --> 13:51.664
You won't believe what I found!

13:51.664 --> 13:54.667
The car! Mrs. Pig's car.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.236
It's a Harvey Hurricane!

13:57.236 --> 14:01.073
It says here, um, that
there are only two of them

14:01.073 --> 14:02.441
in the world!

14:02.441 --> 14:07.847
Mrs. Pig's car is worth
almost a million dollars!

14:09.949 --> 14:11.283
Oooo!!!

14:12.284 --> 14:14.253
You were right, Pop!

14:14.253 --> 14:16.055
It's a Harvey Hurricane.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.457
It's practically priceless.

14:18.457 --> 14:21.760
I knew it, I knew it the
moment I laid eyes on it.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.563
It's a winner!
And I got it for nothing!

14:24.563 --> 14:27.366
With this and my
Clarence Cyclone,

14:27.366 --> 14:29.869
I'll make a fortune
at auto shows!

14:32.071 --> 14:35.074
I want this car in mint
condition for the show!

14:35.074 --> 14:37.610
I don't care where you
get the parts for it,

14:37.610 --> 14:39.044
just get 'em!

14:39.545 --> 14:41.981
Don't just stand there
with your fur growing!

14:41.981 --> 14:43.883
Get to work. Now!

I'm telling you, Mrs. Pig,

if you enter that
antique car of yours

15:53.218 --> 15:56.488
in Lady Baden-Baden's
antique car show,

15:56.488 --> 15:58.657
you're sure to be a winner!

15:58.657 --> 16:01.460
Now, let's not get
our hopes up too high.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.896
We've got an awful
lot of work to do,

16:03.896 --> 16:05.965
and very little time to do it.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.733
Mrs. Pig: I can't believe it!

16:07.733 --> 16:10.169
I've had that old car for years!

16:10.169 --> 16:13.138
Huh?!
Holy mackerel!

16:13.138 --> 16:15.341
Somebody's been busy.

16:15.341 --> 16:18.310
Mrs. Pig: And I
think I know who.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.412
Oh, those boys of mine!

16:20.412 --> 16:22.548
They're full of surprises.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.417
(laughs) I can't
argue with you there.

16:25.417 --> 16:28.220
Mrs. Pig: Well Bert,
pull down the rumble seat

16:28.220 --> 16:30.389
and let's take her for a spin!

16:31.090 --> 16:32.992
This is fantastic!

16:32.992 --> 16:35.260
I own a Clarence Cyclone

16:35.260 --> 16:37.429
and a Harvey Hurricane.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.999
There's no stopping me now!

16:42.234 --> 16:43.635
Mrs. Pig: Hi boys!

16:43.635 --> 16:45.838
You did a terrific job!

16:45.838 --> 16:48.407
Who in the name
of hubcaps was that??

16:48.407 --> 16:51.210
Pig 1: Uh, uhm.. Bert and
Schaeffer, wasn't it?

16:51.210 --> 16:54.079
I know that,
you pea-brained porkers!

16:54.079 --> 16:55.447
Who's the ring leader?

16:55.447 --> 16:59.184
Pig 2: Um, gee...
That would be.. um...

16:59.184 --> 17:02.054
Never mind!
I'll find out when I catch her!

17:02.054 --> 17:03.088
Come on!!

17:04.089 --> 17:07.059
Mrs. Pig your
car is beautiful!

17:07.059 --> 17:11.030
Why, that $100,000 prize money

17:11.030 --> 17:13.132
is as good as yours!

17:13.132 --> 17:16.402
Mrs. Pig: $100,000 !!

17:16.402 --> 17:20.105
Good heavens, you never said
the prize was that big!

17:20.105 --> 17:22.408
That's a fortune, Bert.

17:22.408 --> 17:24.476
and it certainly
would come in handy.

17:24.476 --> 17:25.744
Yeah.

17:25.744 --> 17:29.415
That kind of money would
buy a lot of peanut butter!

17:29.415 --> 17:30.816
In fact,

17:30.816 --> 17:34.153
it could buy a whole
peanut butter factory!

17:34.787 --> 17:36.488
Grand theft auto!!

17:36.488 --> 17:39.491
That's what it is!
Grand theft, auto!!

17:39.491 --> 17:42.995
Pig 1: Boss, maybe you're taking
this a bit too seriously.

17:42.995 --> 17:45.898
Maybe you should
just let them... go?

17:45.898 --> 17:47.466
I'll let them
go as soon as

17:47.466 --> 17:49.635
I'm holding them
over a steep cliff!

17:50.903 --> 17:54.273
I hope you pigs have
paid up my hospital insurance!

17:54.273 --> 17:56.108
We've got no brakes!

17:56.108 --> 17:57.743
Yahhhh!!!!

17:57.743 --> 17:59.478
Mrs. Pig: You know it's funny,

17:59.478 --> 18:02.648
the boys have told me
so much about him,

18:02.648 --> 18:05.451
but I've never had the
pleasure of meeting Mr. Sneer.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.319
Aarrrggghhh!!!
Huh?

18:08.821 --> 18:11.190
Well there he is, right now.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.827
He shouldn't be
driving that fast on this road.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.463
Why, he's out of control!

18:17.463 --> 18:19.465
It looks like he's
lost his brakes!!

18:19.465 --> 18:21.300
Mrs. Pig: And my
sons are with him!!!

18:21.300 --> 18:24.369
Hang on, boys!
We're going for a ride!!!

18:25.637 --> 18:27.806
Oooh! Oh, so help me!

18:27.806 --> 18:29.374
Pig 3: Mom!!!

18:29.374 --> 18:32.111
It's mom!
Mom?!

18:32.111 --> 18:35.447
Pig 3: It's a long story, boss.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.849
Give me
the short version.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.650
I don't think we've got long.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.953
Mrs. Pig: Jump boys! Jump!!

18:40.953 --> 18:43.789
Uaaah-ugh!

18:43.789 --> 18:44.890
Phew!

18:44.890 --> 18:47.059
C'mon Cyril!
It's your turn!

18:47.059 --> 18:48.827
Are you crazy?!

18:48.827 --> 18:50.462
And let this baby crash!

18:52.731 --> 18:55.234
Don't go away.
I'm coming!!

18:56.969 --> 18:58.303
Umph!

19:08.747 --> 19:10.349
My car!!

19:10.349 --> 19:14.019
My beautiful, perfect
automotive marvel!

19:14.019 --> 19:15.354
Wrecked!

19:15.354 --> 19:19.258
Mrs. Pig: Oh, Mr. Sneer,
I'm so sorry.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.526
Decimated,

19:20.526 --> 19:21.693
demolished,

19:21.693 --> 19:23.095
destroyed!

19:23.095 --> 19:26.198
But I still have my
Harvey Hurricane.

19:26.198 --> 19:29.168
I can still win the contest!

19:29.168 --> 19:32.337
Mrs. Pig: Excuse me,
but that's my car.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.405
Your car?

19:33.405 --> 19:35.274
Mrs. Pig: Yes, for years.

19:35.274 --> 19:38.343
Apparently there's been
a small misunderstanding.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.045
I'll say there has.

19:40.045 --> 19:42.848
Three small misunderstandings!

19:42.848 --> 19:44.216
Pigs!!!

19:44.216 --> 19:46.418
Y-y-yes, boss?

19:46.418 --> 19:47.586
Mrs. Pig: Boss?!

19:47.586 --> 19:49.521
That's right! Boss!

19:49.521 --> 19:53.592
Don't you think it's time we
were formally introduced?

19:53.592 --> 19:56.595
Pig 2: Oh, sh-sh-sure, boss...

19:56.595 --> 20:00.299
Um... m-m-mom,
t-t-this is our boss.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.734
Pig 3: Uh.. boss,

20:02.734 --> 20:05.270
t-t-this is our mom.

20:05.270 --> 20:08.207
Pig 1: And our name is mud.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.243
Mrs. Pig: Mr. Sneer,
it looks like you and I

20:11.243 --> 20:13.779
have a few things to
straighten out here.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.948
We certainly do, Mrs. Pig.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.883
We certainly do.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.786
Pig 2: Oh my.

20:23.488 --> 20:29.761
Lady Baden-Baden: And the
first prize of $100,000

20:29.761 --> 20:33.498
goes to

20:33.498 --> 20:36.235
the joint winners!

20:36.235 --> 20:40.639
Mrs. Pig and Cyril Sneer!

20:42.274 --> 20:44.443
You know, Suey-Ellen,

20:44.443 --> 20:47.412
this is a very sporting of you.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.181
Mrs. Pig: Oh nonsense, Cyril.

20:49.181 --> 20:52.184
I had no chance of winning
without your help.

20:52.184 --> 20:55.787
After all, half the parts
in the car belong to you,

20:55.787 --> 20:59.625
and half the prize money is all
I need to rebuild my home.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.160
I'm just sorry you lost your car

21:02.160 --> 21:03.462
because of all this.

21:03.462 --> 21:06.064
Well, it's
not exactly lost.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.467
I do know, where it is.

21:08.467 --> 21:09.801
Roughly.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.871
Fortunately
for Mrs. Pig,

21:12.871 --> 21:15.774
her old car meant new
hope for the future.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.209
For Cyril Sneer,

21:17.209 --> 21:19.144
it meant finding a new friend.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.846
And for the pigs?

21:20.846 --> 21:23.181
Well, some things never change.

21:23.181 --> 21:26.285
Just as a mother's love for
her children never changes,

21:26.285 --> 21:28.553
no matter who they
pretend to be.

21:29.354 --> 21:32.524
Pig 3: Hey, I found a fender!

21:32.524 --> 21:36.561
Pig 1: Great. Only 3,425

21:36.561 --> 21:38.530
more pieces to go

21:38.530 --> 21:40.532
before the boss will talk to us.

21:41.733 --> 21:45.537
Pig 2: Oh well,
at least mom still loves us!

21:46.004 --> 21:47.506
Yeah!
