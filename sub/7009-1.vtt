10:05.021 --> 10:06.438
HA HA.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.647
EVEN IF WE DO GET IT,

10:07.815 --> 10:10.108
WE'RE GONNA NEED
SOME SERIOUS GAS MONEY,

10:10.276 --> 10:13.445
'CAUSE THE CRUISER'S
A BOAT.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.656
I KNOW IT'S A BOAT.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.618
THIS WHOLE
GAS SHORTAGE BITES.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.580
WHO'S GETTING A BOAT?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.791
THERE IS NO
GAS SHORTAGE, MAN.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.835
IT'S ALL FAKE.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.588
THE OIL COMPANIES
CONTROL EVERYTHING.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.466
LIKE, THERE'S THIS GUY
WHO INVENTED THIS CAR...

10:34.634 --> 10:36.593
THAT RUNS ON WATER, MAN.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.595
IT'S GOT A FIBERGLASS,
AIR-COOLED ENGINE

10:38.763 --> 10:41.431
AND IT RUNS ON WATER.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.726
SO IT IS A BOAT.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.233
NO, IT'S A CAR.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.904
ONLY YOU PUT WATER IN
THE GAS TANK INSTEAD OF GAS.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.864
HA HA HA HA.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.784
AND IT RUNS
ON WATER, MAN!

11:06.957 --> 11:10.335
I NEVER HEARD OF THIS CAR.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.088
HEY, JACKIE'S GOOD
FOR GAS MONEY.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.342
YOU ARE SUCH A WHORE.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.554
WHEN DOES THE BOAT
GET HERE, WHORE?

11:24.725 --> 11:25.850
ERIC!

11:26.018 --> 11:26.810
YEAH, DAD?

11:26.977 --> 11:28.561
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!

11:29.438 --> 11:31.398
ERIC...

11:31.565 --> 11:34.609
YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE BEEN TALKING.

11:34.777 --> 11:39.030
SINCE I'VE BEEN CUT BACK
TO PART-TIME AT THE PLANT...

11:39.198 --> 11:41.783
AND THE, UH, THE HOSPITAL
IS SO CLOSE,

11:41.951 --> 11:43.284
I CAN TAKE THE TOYOTA
TO WORK,

11:43.452 --> 11:46.996
AND YOUR MOM
CAN TAKE THE BUS.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.667
HONEY...

11:50.835 --> 11:52.377
HONEY, REALLY,
I'D RATHER WALK.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.337
WHEN I RIDE THE BUS
IN MY NURSE'S UNIFORM,

11:54.505 --> 11:57.549
PEOPLE ALWAYS SHOW ME
THEIR SCARS.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.217
THEN I'LL DROP YOU OFF
ON MY WAY TO THE PLANT.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.010
WELL, NO. I DON'T WANT
TO BE ANY TROUBLE.

12:01.178 --> 12:01.886
THEN ERIC
CAN DROP YOU OFF.

12:02.054 --> 12:02.887
OH HONEY,
HE'S A TEENAGER.

12:03.055 --> 12:03.722
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DROP OFF-

12:03.889 --> 12:05.849
WELL, IF HE CAN'T DROP HIS
OWN MOTHER OFF AT WORK,

12:06.016 --> 12:07.851
WELL THEN, I'LL BE DAMNED
IF HE'S GETTING A CAR.

12:08.018 --> 12:08.727
OK.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.061
EXCUSE ME.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.521
AM I GETTING THE CAR?

12:11.689 --> 12:14.399
WE DIDN'T SAY THAT.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.569
THINGS DON'T JUST DROP
INTO YOUR LAP, ERIC.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.863
NOT IN THIS LIFE.

12:20.030 --> 12:24.033
A CAR IS
A RESPONSIBILITY.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.160
YOU'LL NEED INSURANCE.

12:25.327 --> 12:28.288
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH INSURANCE IS?

12:28.456 --> 12:30.081
A CAR IS A PRIVILEGE.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.209
OIL CHANGES,
ROAD FLARES...

12:33.377 --> 12:36.504
FLUIDS.
THAT'S YOUR JOB!

12:36.672 --> 12:40.633
A CAR IS NOT
A BEDROOM ON WHEELS.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.344
ALWAYS YIELD. ALWAYS.

12:43.512 --> 12:48.767
LAURIE'S FRIEND GOT PREGNANT
IN A CAR. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.812
IF I FIND ONE BEER CAN
IN THAT CAR, IT'S OVER.

12:52.980 --> 12:57.692
AND NO DOUGHNUTS,
EITHER.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.444
ANTS.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.031
SO...

13:03.199 --> 13:05.325
DO I GET THE CAR?

13:14.543 --> 13:15.084
BITCHING!

13:15.252 --> 13:16.795
ERIC.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.506
NOT IN FRONT
OF YOUR MOTHER.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.674
THANK YOU, POP...

13:21.842 --> 13:22.967

I'M RIDING SHOTGUN.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.068
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.861
WELL, I'M NOT RIDING
IN THE BACK.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.905
WHY DON'T WE
LET ERIC DECIDE?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.073
ERIC?

13:45.241 --> 13:46.491
KELSO...

13:46.659 --> 13:48.618

13:52.122 --> 13:53.414

13:53.582 --> 13:54.374
YES, SIR.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.543
WELL,
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.836
OH, UH...

13:58.003 --> 13:58.711
ONE MORE THING.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.214
VERY IMPORTANT.
ABOUT THE CAR.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.716
SHE'S OLD, SO...

14:03.884 --> 14:05.426
NO TRIPS
OUT OF TOWN.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.345
EVER.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.888
UNDERSTOOD?

14:09.056 --> 14:10.348
WELL...

14:10.516 --> 14:14.686

14:14.854 --> 14:17.564
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S THAT.
WE'RE NOT GOING.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.315
ERIC,
DO YOU WANT TO GO?

14:19.483 --> 14:20.775
HE SAID NO TRIPS
OUT OF TOWN.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.111
IT'S YOUR CAR.
DO YOU WANT TO GO?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.280
HE'S GOD.

14:25.447 --> 14:29.075
I THINK GOD WOULD WANT US
TO GO TO MILWAUKEE.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.495
ERIC, YOU ARE
A 17-YEAR-OLD MAN.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.330
I'M GONNA GO WITH
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

14:34.498 --> 14:37.458
IT'S YOUR DECISION.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.919
IT IS MY DECISION.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.797
AND MY DECISION IS...

14:42.965 --> 14:43.798
WE'RE GOING
TO A CONCERT.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.550

[CAR LEAVING]

14:48.387 --> 14:49.679
OH.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.180
THE KIDS ARE OFF.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.057
I WONDER WHERE
THEY'RE GOING.

14:53.225 --> 14:57.395
OUT OF TOWN.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.897
ARE YOU SURE?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.440
OF COURSE.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.567
I TOLD THEM NOT TO.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.408
SO I GUESS THEY'LL BE GONE
FOR A WHILE.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.160
YEAH.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.749
LET'S GO.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.884

WE'RE OUT OF GAS.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.260
WE'RE NOT
OUT OF GAS.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.638
IT'S THE BATTERY.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.556
IT'S 6 YEARS OLD
AND SHOT TO HELL.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.183
I KNOW WHAT.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.267
I'LL JUST CALL
MY DAD.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.478

15:38.646 --> 15:40.188

TO EACH OTHER

15:45.152 --> 15:48.988
ABOUT HOW WE SCREW UP.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.740
WHY WOULD THEY TALK
ABOUT THAT?

15:50.908 --> 15:51.866
THEY CAN'T HELP IT.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.785
LOOK, SAY THERE'S
A PARTY, SEE.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.371
