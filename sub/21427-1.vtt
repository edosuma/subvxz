01:34.120 --> 01:35.839
Mommy!

01:38.000 --> 01:39.070
How far can I go?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.554
Just down the street and back.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.637
- You gonna visit the nest for me?
- Yes!

01:45.880 --> 01:47.030
Okay.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.630
Go on, big girl.

01:49.720 --> 01:50.870
Whee!

01:50.960 --> 01:51.950
Come on, Max.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.713
Hey, I'll keep an eye on her for you.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.714
Max! Max!

02:16.680 --> 02:17.670
I win.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.472
Come on, back in.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.556
Come on!

Come on, boy!

Max, come on!

02:29.640 --> 02:30.630
Come on.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.954
Mrs. Deluca they hatched!

02:35.280 --> 02:36.953
That is so great sweetie!

02:37.040 --> 02:37.996
Come on, Max!

02:53.200 --> 02:54.190
Momma?

03:03.960 --> 03:04.950
Mommy?

03:24.480 --> 03:25.470
Momma?

04:26.640 --> 04:27.710
Morning!

04:27.800 --> 04:29.314
Aw, you look so nice.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.273
- Bye!
- Bye, Mrs. Deluca.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.314
<i># She moved like the ocean #</i>

04:50.680 --> 04:51.830

Yeah!

04:53.280 --> 04:55.158
<i># Go get it, L-E... #</i>

04:56.160 --> 04:56.991
Hi, Uncle August.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.799
- No, I'll get the paper.
- Thank you, Clare.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.756
<i># Let's go, let's go #

05:06.080 --> 05:07.719
Go get off the road, winner!

05:08.560 --> 05:10.358
I'm trying to drive here!

05:17.760 --> 05:18.671
Ow!

05:18.960 --> 05:19.950
Oh, gosh...

05:24.360 --> 05:25.271
Are you alright?

05:25.360 --> 05:26.510
Yeah, you know. It's...

05:27.600 --> 05:28.920
it's Monday.

05:30.920 --> 05:31.797
Here you go.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.360
- Thanks
- Yeah.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.631
See you around.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.957
I'll check these. See if there's...

05:52.360 --> 05:54.113
You've gotta be kidding me.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.116
Come on!

05:57.640 --> 05:58.551
Check it out.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.111
Dad!

06:04.440 --> 06:05.430
You serious?

06:06.760 --> 06:07.637
What'd I do now?

06:07.920 --> 06:10.230
You promised
that you wouldn't do this at my school.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.030
We're not at your school.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.395
We're across the street from your school.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.551
Yeah, but people can still see you.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.710
Well, who the hell's watching?

06:16.800 --> 06:18.632
Yeah, her dad's a dumpster driver.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.040
Hey, what happened there?

06:21.560 --> 06:24.435
I fell at Uncle August's house,
he saw the whole thing.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.872
What did I tell you
about talking to Uncle August?

06:26.960 --> 06:28.917
You said not to. But I really don't see why.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.512
Dad, you're killing me, okay?

06:32.040 --> 06:32.951
Hey!

06:33.160 --> 06:34.514
Come on, let's roll out, Shannon.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.031
Thank you.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.750
<i># You get so excited by the prospect #</i>

06:48.240 --> 06:51.039
<i># Of a gentium way #</i>

06:51.560 --> 06:55.349
<i># So surprised by all the possibilities #</i>

06:56.720 --> 06:57.631
So...

06:58.800 --> 06:59.950
what do you guys think?

07:00.040 --> 07:00.871
So good.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.759
- How long it take you?
- Ah, yeah, like weeks.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.672
Clare, you try way too hard, dude.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.593
Jesus, it's better than not trying at all.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.797
- Will you guys help me hang it?
- I got you.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.439
Yeah, just give me one sec.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.076
What is she doing?

07:16.280 --> 07:18.875
It's called <i>Monster Mutant Slayer.</i>

07:19.560 --> 07:20.550
Dumbest game ever.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.474
Hey! Don't mock
what you don't understand dude, okay?

07:23.560 --> 07:25.517
If I kill Lurching Louisa and Hacked-Up Harry

07:25.600 --> 07:26.954
I level up to Mutant Killer.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.513
And if I get Malformed Molly,
I'm a Monster Mutant Master, man!

07:30.600 --> 07:32.080
I know. Awesome? Yes.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.639
Got it.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.632
- Stop!
- Sorry. Don't mind him.

07:42.000 --> 07:42.831
My bad.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.320
Seriously? Bird ass!

07:44.440 --> 07:45.396
Recycle first.

07:47.640 --> 07:48.676
Recycle first.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.271
Hey, Clare.

07:53.880 --> 07:54.870
I liked your banner.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.234
Yeah, I liked it too.

08:56.760 --> 08:57.955
Hey, Carl!

08:58.040 --> 08:58.951
Look at this!

08:59.160 --> 09:00.560
That would fetch a ton at the swap.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.354
I have a better idea.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.960
- Jesus, what's...
- It's so bad.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.759
Put it away.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.880
I mean she's seriously smeggy.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.076
Like ultimate smeggy.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.634
- I know!
- What was that?

09:19.720 --> 09:20.631
Um...

09:21.560 --> 09:22.391
nothing. No.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.597
Um. Mm. But you were laughing.

09:24.840 --> 09:25.830
Which is co-signing.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.111
And we wanna know
what you were laughing about.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.590
Go ahead.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.111
Everyone's listening.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.831
Okay.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.517
Clare, come on.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.080
Go Clare. Yeah, do it.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.991
What's so funny, winner?

09:41.280 --> 09:42.600
Yeah, what's funny...

09:43.760 --> 09:45.353
is that you're smegma.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.596
But like...

09:47.680 --> 09:49.319
ultimate smegma.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.799
What does that even mean?

09:54.360 --> 09:56.113
- Oh, Clare. I got it.
- Well..

09:56.400 --> 09:57.231
Thank you.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.674
Yeah, this is great. Um...

09:59.440 --> 10:00.874
Smegma. It's a noun.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.439
"A malodorous, opaque,
white or yellow substance

10:05.520 --> 10:10.274
produced by the sebaceous glands
of male and female genitalia."

10:10.880 --> 10:13.714
It's found beneath the foreskin and glands
of the penis in males,

10:13.840 --> 10:18.756
and in the folds of skin surrounding
the clitoris in females.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.071
Oh, I... I...

10:21.400 --> 10:24.837
I'm so sorry. Would you like me to define
"ultimate" for you?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.991
Oooh!

10:30.200 --> 10:32.078
Come on. Yeah.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.833
You got it, Clare!

10:37.800 --> 10:39.792
Get up! Get up!

10:48.960 --> 10:50.952
Beat her up, Clare!

10:51.040 --> 10:54.431
Drop her like a red-headed baby
fresh out of the vagina!

10:59.480 --> 11:01.358
Get away from her! Let her go!

11:02.160 --> 11:02.991
Ooh!

11:14.040 --> 11:15.759
Son of a bitch! Get back here!

11:25.640 --> 11:26.471
What's in it?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.552
It's broccoli, apple, lemon and ginger.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.279
'Cause we don't want you to bruise.

11:31.720 --> 11:32.631
You know what you need.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.435
Please don't say it. Please.

11:34.880 --> 11:35.916
A nice boy.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.472
- You said it.
- Or a nice girl.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.914
Come on, come on, come on.

11:40.000 --> 11:40.990
You must like someone.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.995
I do, but...

11:44.160 --> 11:45.389
So what's his or her name?

11:46.040 --> 11:46.951
Paul.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.912
I think he said hi to me once.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.151
Well, that's something.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.031
In the fifth grade.

11:58.440 --> 11:59.396
Hi, Max.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.636
Hey.

12:02.880 --> 12:03.791
There you go.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.033
Man, you got the green stuff.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.230
It's called "salad".

12:14.040 --> 12:15.793
It's healthy and you're welcome.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.434
I got you a little something, buddy.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.556
It's up on your bed.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.360
Dad, please...
we've talked about this already.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.351
You've your space

12:22.440 --> 12:23.954
- and then there's my space.
- I know!

12:24.040 --> 12:27.511
I just found it at this fancy place.
It's got Chinese writing on it.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.272
Figured since you're taking Chinese...

12:30.360 --> 12:32.079
If you don't want it, Carl'll take it.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.510
Shit, you're damn right.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.793
Just consider it an early birthday present.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.200
Come on, Max.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.111
Whoa!

13:03.440 --> 13:04.794
"Wishes...

13:04.880 --> 13:05.870
seven."

13:18.760 --> 13:22.197
<i># I see the lines #
# You try to hide from me... #</i>

13:23.280 --> 13:24.555
<i># And... #</i>

13:25.520 --> 13:27.671
<i># A little bit #</i>

13:28.200 --> 13:30.590
<i># Of my heart feels #</i>

13:31.000 --> 13:34.880
<i># Like we're all messed up inside #</i>

13:36.280 --> 13:41.309
<i># And a little part, #
# Of the fear is gone... #</i>

13:41.400 --> 13:42.550
Of course that would happen.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.871
<i># When you say goodnight... #</i>

13:44.960 --> 13:50.035
<i># These Night Lies #
# Ya little bit of my heart... #</i>

14:10.920 --> 14:12.559
Seven wishes...

14:16.560 --> 14:17.755
Why not?

14:21.400 --> 14:23.039
I wish that...

14:24.360 --> 14:25.874
Darcie Chapman,

14:27.240 --> 14:28.151
would just...

14:30.560 --> 14:32.916
I don't know, but just, like, go rot!

14:40.560 --> 14:41.471
Max?

14:46.120 --> 14:48.316
Come on! Come here!

14:50.520 --> 14:51.874
Okay.

16:38.720 --> 16:39.676
Oh, my God!

16:40.720 --> 16:42.791
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

16:43.720 --> 16:45.996
Oh, my God!

16:46.520 --> 16:47.920
Oh, my God.

16:51.880 --> 16:52.916
Oh, my God!

17:00.520 --> 17:01.351
Darcie?

17:01.440 --> 17:02.510
Darcie!

17:02.600 --> 17:04.114
Oh! Ah!

17:04.200 --> 17:06.954
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

17:07.040 --> 17:09.919
Necrotizing fasciitis.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.108
- No!
- Yeah.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.156
- What?
- Yeah.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.071
So apparently, She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named

17:15.160 --> 17:16.833
picked up a case of it at the spa.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.194
And now she's at the ICU.

17:18.280 --> 17:21.755
She might lose her toes, part
of her leg, and part of her face.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.319
How sweet is that?

17:23.640 --> 17:25.518
Ah, she's rotting!

17:25.599 --> 17:26.511
Yeah.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.638
Apparently Karma is a bigger bitch
than Darcie Chapman.

17:29.720 --> 17:30.756
Who knew?

17:35.240 --> 17:36.117
Oh!

17:36.960 --> 17:38.030
- It's for Darcie.
- Oh!

17:38.160 --> 17:40.277
You said that like we should care.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.953
Um, we're starting a GoFundMe.

17:43.040 --> 17:43.917
Go fund this.

17:45.000 --> 17:45.877
Yeah.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.278
- Go on. Scooch. Bye.
- It's fine. It's fine.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.317
- Meredith.
- It's whatever.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.672
- Oh, my God!
- You're proud.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.353
- I gotta go.
- All right.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.152
Definitely have my attention, lucky box.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.440
Max, come here.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.351
Max?

18:33.080 --> 18:34.196
Max?

18:34.520 --> 18:35.636
Where are you?

18:37.040 --> 18:37.951
Max?

18:42.600 --> 18:43.477
Ma...

18:51.600 --> 18:53.034
Max, are you in there? Buddy?

18:56.560 --> 18:57.471
Buddy?

18:59.920 --> 19:00.831
You in there?

19:03.240 --> 19:05.471
You know you're not supposed to be down here.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.270
Ow.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.436
Max?

19:46.600 --> 19:47.556
Max!

20:02.440 --> 20:03.590
He was a good dog.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.720
Mom gave him to me.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.469
I know, buddy.

20:17.320 --> 20:20.631
But the majority of the characters
are written in Ancient Chinese.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.431
If you want an accurate translation,
you'll probably have to talk to a scholar.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.159
- Got it. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.396
My cousin could hook it up.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.519
Ancient Chinese is her thing.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.640
She'd help you out, for a price.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.279
I don't really have any money.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.430
Who said anything about money?

20:38.520 --> 20:39.510
He'll take a tit pic.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.511
- Uh...
- And so will I.

20:43.120 --> 20:43.997
- What?
- Um...

20:44.080 --> 20:45.036
Never mind.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.031
Sorry.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.158
Offer still stands if you change your mind.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.272
- Dude, seriously?
- Just kidding.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.396
<i>Hey guys, do you feel that?</i>

20:52.520 --> 20:54.477
It's like the darkness has been lifted

20:54.560 --> 20:56.836
ever since Bitchface-Since-Birth
left the building.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.392
I heard they had to amputate
a few of her toes.

20:59.960 --> 21:00.950
Sweet.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.998
Guys, we shouldn't be happy about this.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.797
Clare, I never said I was happy.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.512
I'm freaking ecstatic, man!

21:09.600 --> 21:10.920
Almost like being here.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.040
<i># Laying me down #</i>

21:33.120 --> 21:35.715
<i># Down on the floor #</i>

21:35.800 --> 21:37.917
<i># Waiting for a song to play #</i>

21:41.080 --> 21:45.313
<i># You keep on begging me for more #</i>

21:45.400 --> 21:48.074
<i># I love when you say my name #</i>

21:51.680 --> 21:53.273
<i># Tell me, tell me why #</i>

21:53.360 --> 21:58.116
<i># Were you trying to hide #
# From the fallout? #</i>

22:01.200 --> 22:05.353
<i># Someone tell me why #
# I'm on the other side #</i>

22:05.440 --> 22:08.399
<i># Is it countdown? #</i>

22:10.240 --> 22:13.677
<i># I'll wait up with you #
# I'll stay up #</i>

22:13.760 --> 22:15.274
I wish that

22:15.360 --> 22:19.593
Paul Middlebrook
would fall madly in love with me.

22:19.680 --> 22:24.152
<i># I'll wait up with you #
# I'll stay up with you #</i>

22:24.280 --> 22:27.557
<i># I'll wake up with you #</i>

22:29.240 --> 22:33.359
<i># You give it all, you take it back #</i>

22:33.440 --> 22:37.229
<i># Why's it gotta feel so right? #</i>

22:43.120 --> 22:44.031
Oh!

22:44.400 --> 22:45.311
Hey.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.190
Hey.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.550
- Paul?
- Yeah.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.114
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.236
- So I...
- Bell ringing.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.595
I'll see you around Claire.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.670
Yep!

23:52.600 --> 23:55.513
Oh, my God. Oh, My God.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.719
<i>And now, this news just coming in.</i>

24:14.880 --> 24:16.030
- <i>A local resident...</i>
- Hey.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.630
<i>...owner of the iconic
glass house estate in Gates Mills</i>

24:18.720 --> 24:20.040
- What's going on?
- <i>August Anderson,</i>

24:20.120 --> 24:23.272
<i>was found deceased
in his residence this afternoon.</i>

24:27.800 --> 24:29.314
Are we going to the funeral?

24:29.400 --> 24:32.671
Hey, as far as I'm concerned, good riddance.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.720
What's gonna happen to all of his stuff?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.480
If there's a will, trust me, we ain't in it.

24:39.480 --> 24:40.391
Yeah.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.471
Course not.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.230
Ow! Dammit, Dad! Come on!

24:46.320 --> 24:49.791
- What?
- We don't have room for all of this crap!

24:49.880 --> 24:51.109
Hey, hey, hey.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.554
- What?
- I'm going to use those.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.393
What do you need these for, huh?

24:55.400 --> 24:58.472
Dad, seriously.
You can't get rid of anything!

24:59.280 --> 25:00.475
What would Mom say, huh?

25:02.960 --> 25:03.871
Dad.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.949
Dad! Are you listening to... God!

25:08.440 --> 25:10.432
You never listen to anything I say!

25:24.280 --> 25:25.509
Come on.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.311
I wish...

25:35.080 --> 25:38.278
I wish that Uncle August
would leave me everything.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.431
So there.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.557
God, Clare, you're so stupid.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.393
Uh, thank you for calling.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.471
What's going on, Dad?

26:07.560 --> 26:08.630
You're never gonna believe this.

26:10.040 --> 26:10.871
What?

26:10.960 --> 26:12.679
Apparently, you weren't cut out of his will.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.720
How much do we get?

26:22.080 --> 26:22.991
All of it, buddy.

26:24.520 --> 26:25.397
No way.

26:25.560 --> 26:26.914
Yes... way.

26:33.080 --> 26:34.230
Yes!

26:34.920 --> 26:35.990
Yes! Yes! What?

26:37.120 --> 26:38.031
Yes!

26:39.320 --> 26:40.356
You're gonna...

26:40.600 --> 26:42.353
- take the sax with us?
- Why not?

26:42.560 --> 26:45.280
No, you just you haven't played since mom...

26:45.880 --> 26:46.791
You never know.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.319
I'm so happy for you.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.116
Sweetheart.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.278
Come visit, or you'll hurt my feelings.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.513
- Of course.
- Okay.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.193
- Dad?
- Down here, bud.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.951
- What are you waiting for? Get in!
- Okay, okay, okay.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.640
Oh, my God!

27:15.720 --> 27:16.995
Call the girls.

27:18.120 --> 27:22.160
<i># 'Cause all we ever wanted #
# Was to feel like this #</i>

27:22.240 --> 27:26.200
<i># All we ever wanted #
# All we ever wanted #</i>

27:26.280 --> 27:30.035
<i># All we ever wanted #

27:30.120 --> 27:34.353
<i># Feel like this it's all we ever wanted #</i>

27:42.240 --> 27:44.596
<i># All we ever wanted #</i>

27:45.640 --> 27:48.758
Um, Clare, that thing is,
like, eight hundred dollars.

27:48.840 --> 27:49.876
I know.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.633
Yeah, so if you buy it, you're an asshole.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.831
Totally.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.511
You want one?

27:55.600 --> 27:58.434
No! Wait, I'm not that psycho shallow,
dude. Come on.

27:59.160 --> 28:00.071
June?

28:01.760 --> 28:03.638
I love you. You're my bestest friend ever.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.154
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.191
Damn!

28:10.000 --> 28:11.070
Peer pressure.

28:11.560 --> 28:15.076
<i># All we ever wanted #
# Was to feel like this #</i>

28:15.160 --> 28:16.514
Out of the way, peasants.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.354
<i># ... we ever wanted #
# All we ever wanted #</i>

28:19.440 --> 28:23.150

28:23.240 --> 28:27.200
<i># Feel like this it's all we ever wanted #</i>

28:29.800 --> 28:31.712
- Bye, guys!
- Bye!

30:37.400 --> 30:38.231
Hmm...

31:07.560 --> 31:09.438
I found something you might like.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.034
They're your mother's.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.830
I found them when I was packing up our stuff.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.753
Wow.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.232
I forgot how good she was.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.439
Where do you think you get it from?

31:27.520 --> 31:28.954
Some of these are so happy.

31:30.880 --> 31:31.791
So was she.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.356
Until she wasn't.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.080
Why do you think she did it?

31:48.840 --> 31:52.277
Buddy, I've been asking myself that
every single day for the last 12 years.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.310
Still don't have an answer.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.634
Do you think I'm like her?

32:03.680 --> 32:04.909
Course you are.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.795
No, no, no, sweetie, no.

32:07.680 --> 32:08.716
Not like that.

32:10.440 --> 32:14.710
What I mean is, you're smart and funny,
you don't take people's crap.

32:15.360 --> 32:19.593
Well, statistically, if you have a parent
that committed suicide...

32:19.680 --> 32:22.400
Clare, she was a good woman,
but she had a rough childhood.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.354
And secrets, honey.

32:25.760 --> 32:26.716
I think that...

32:29.280 --> 32:30.191
I think maybe...

32:31.560 --> 32:33.870
her secrets were too big to live with and...

32:35.960 --> 32:37.519
it was easier to just let go.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.200
I'm sorry. Come here.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.120
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just not into it any more.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.993
It's not you... It's just...

34:10.639 --> 34:12.120
Are you breaking up with me?

34:12.199 --> 34:13.998
I can't date someone
I don't have feelings for.

34:16.040 --> 34:16.951
Right.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.231
Right.

34:23.880 --> 34:24.791
Oh!

34:32.639 --> 34:33.551
Oh!

34:34.239 --> 34:35.310
So, will you?

34:36.440 --> 34:37.396
Will I, what?

34:38.480 --> 34:39.391
Go out with me?

34:40.159 --> 34:41.071
Look...

34:41.239 --> 34:42.150
I know this is short notice but

34:42.239 --> 34:44.960
Senior Scavenge is coming up,
I thought it would be fun if we went.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.196
Paul, you just broke up with your girlfriend.

34:50.679 --> 34:53.036
Plus, I already have a team... but thank you.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.159
But, we can still go.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.235
Yeah, I'll think about it.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.879
Yeah.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.280
Oh! Um...

35:02.200 --> 35:03.111
I'll see you around.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.671
Nice.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.155
Whoo!

35:35.880 --> 35:37.030
- That's it.
- Ryan!

35:37.120 --> 35:37.951
What's the price?

35:38.040 --> 35:38.951
Of?

35:39.760 --> 35:42.070
Your cousin helping me translate something.

35:43.160 --> 35:44.719
Ah... well.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.435
She's a slut for wontons.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.476
Oh?

35:47.560 --> 35:48.596
Done, yeah.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.637
- When can we go?
- Let's go right now!

35:51.240 --> 35:52.151
Awesome.

35:54.560 --> 35:57.394
<i># Baby, I was so sad #</i>

35:58.520 --> 35:59.351
<i># Stuck on the couch #</i>

35:59.440 --> 36:01.477
So... I'm waiting.

36:02.840 --> 36:03.717
For?

36:03.800 --> 36:05.154
An apology. Been waiting for years.

36:06.920 --> 36:07.990
What did I do?

36:09.160 --> 36:11.277
First grade. Sharing circle. You farted.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.589
I did not fart!

36:12.680 --> 36:14.751
You farted and you blamed it on me

36:14.840 --> 36:17.799
and everyone called me McFarts
until, like, the sixth grade.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.471
I'm sorry.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.435
Are you really?

36:23.000 --> 36:24.036
Yeah.

36:24.680 --> 36:25.955
Then apology accepted.

36:27.160 --> 36:29.834
But maybe in the multiverse,
it never happened.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.519
Or it did happen and you farted,

36:33.600 --> 36:35.990
blamed it on me and I got called McFarts.

36:36.480 --> 36:37.391
Wait.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.670
You dig on multiverses?

36:38.800 --> 36:42.840
Yeah, I mean, the theory that,
you know, another you exists

36:42.920 --> 36:43.990
in different circumstances

36:44.080 --> 36:47.232
under different planes of reality,
yada, yada, yada.

36:47.640 --> 36:48.551
Yeah, I dig.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.356
Well, maybe in the multiverse,
neither of us farted.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.960
Maybe we're even dating.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.070
Maybe.

36:58.680 --> 36:59.796
Maybe not.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.273
Hey, Gina, it's me. Let me up.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.750
This.

37:15.480 --> 37:16.391
Bitchin'.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.872
Yeah, I don't know anything about it.

37:18.960 --> 37:19.871
And I can't...

37:20.640 --> 37:22.552
I can't really read what it says, but...

37:22.640 --> 37:23.960
Can you open it?

37:26.600 --> 37:29.399
Well, it looks like a
version of a Chinese Wish Pot.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.556
They're pretty common actually.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.791
You take a piece of paper,
write down your wish,

37:33.880 --> 37:35.917
put it in the pot,
and wait for it to come true.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.719
Let's see. This one.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.590
It's heavy.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.070
Okay, it promises to grant seven wishes.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.034
And there are rules.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.754
"Lay your hands upon me."

37:46.840 --> 37:49.150
I guess you have to be touching it
to make a wish?

37:50.520 --> 37:54.439
"Abandon, lose, or sell me
and all your wishes will be undone."

37:56.760 --> 37:57.671
Huh.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.477
Yeah, and what does... What does this say?

38:01.720 --> 38:03.791
That is not a word. It's a name.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.311
"Lu Mei"?

38:10.840 --> 38:12.672
"The legend of Lu Mei."

38:14.120 --> 38:17.431
"In 1910, bubonic plague swept through
mainland China.

38:17.800 --> 38:20.360
Lu Mei and her family were suspected
of being infected

38:20.440 --> 38:22.557
so they were quarantined in a train car

38:22.640 --> 38:25.439
where they died of heat stroke
and dehydration.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.399
Lu Mei was the only survivor.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.751
Local legend says she took the only
valuable thing the family owned,

38:32.200 --> 38:35.432
a music box, and went to a temple
to pray for revenge.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.319
She prayed for seven days and seven nights

38:38.400 --> 38:41.074
and on the seventh night,
a <i>Yaoguai</i> answered."

38:41.160 --> 38:42.071
<i>"Yaoguai"</i> ?

38:42.160 --> 38:44.231
A demon of the Chinese persuasion.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.312
If you believe in that sort of thing.

38:49.480 --> 38:53.554
It says, "Lu Mei became very wealthy
and her enemies were vanquished.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.111
In 1922, she died.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.111
Suicide.

38:57.640 --> 38:58.551
Opium."

38:59.080 --> 38:59.991
Romantic.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.196
So...

39:01.280 --> 39:03.033
what do these numbers mean on the bottom?

39:03.480 --> 39:04.800
I have no idea.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.036
A mystery.

39:06.840 --> 39:09.309
Um... It also says,

39:09.920 --> 39:11.479
"When the music ends..."

39:12.040 --> 39:13.474
something happens.

39:14.000 --> 39:14.911
Like?

39:15.600 --> 39:17.592
I don't know.
It could be a few different things but

39:17.680 --> 39:20.718
my guy Mike at UWA, he's pretty smart, so

39:20.800 --> 39:22.757
I will let you know what he says.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.440
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.273
- Here, get this.
- Thanks.

39:27.400 --> 39:30.871
All right. Well, me and my 'tons
need some time alone.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.917
I prefer to destroy them in private.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.071
Need anything else?

39:34.160 --> 39:35.799
- No. We're out.
- Cool.

39:36.160 --> 39:38.197
- It was great to meet you.
- You too.

39:38.280 --> 39:39.475
Thanks.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.436
Hey, hey.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.434
She's cute. Ask her out.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.600
I'm trying.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.998
Good luck.

39:50.960 --> 39:53.350
- Bye!
- Bye.

39:54.680 --> 39:55.796
Aww.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.800
Mmmm... Yum!

39:59.840 --> 40:01.320
<i># Drive... #</i>

40:04.360 --> 40:05.396
What's up?

40:05.640 --> 40:08.280
Nothing. I just...
I feel like Lu Mei's box...

40:08.560 --> 40:09.835
- God!
- Whoa.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.109
Good stuff in here.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.839
Dad, what are you doing?

40:14.120 --> 40:15.520
Wha... What are you talking about?

40:15.640 --> 40:17.916
I'm just hanging out with Carl,
picking up some stuff.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.834
Dad, we live in a fricking mansion.
What else do you need?

40:20.920 --> 40:21.990
Clare.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.673
- It's not a big...
- No, forget about it.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.520
You didn't see that.

40:35.880 --> 40:39.317
No. Totally didn't see your dad
digging through the trash at all.

40:49.920 --> 40:53.357
I wish that my Dad would just...

40:55.040 --> 40:57.430
just stop being so embarrassing.

41:04.680 --> 41:07.275

Great.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.437
You gotta be kidding me.

41:44.720 --> 41:45.631
Ryan.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.157
Can I say something totally inappropriate?

42:18.360 --> 42:19.680
Sure, go for it.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.196
Your dad is, like...

42:23.920 --> 42:25.559
serious hot sauce.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.433
Like Sriracha hot.

42:38.240 --> 42:39.310
Yes!

42:41.200 --> 42:42.953
<i>Yo, it's Ryan. Leave a message.</i>

42:43.440 --> 42:46.717
Hey, it's Gina.
I got that translation for you and...

42:47.560 --> 42:49.074
it's messed up.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.879
Fuck! Um...

42:53.720 --> 42:56.633
it's so messed up,
it's actually beginning to freak me out.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.116
So, ah, call me back
as soon as you can and...

44:16.080 --> 44:17.833
Hey, Gina, it's me. Let me up.

44:21.720 --> 44:22.949
Hello?

44:44.800 --> 44:45.756
Gina!

44:46.840 --> 44:47.876
Gina!

44:52.720 --> 44:53.915
Gina?

44:57.560 --> 44:59.836
No. No, no, no, no!

45:00.480 --> 45:01.391
Fuck!

45:03.120 --> 45:04.031
Oh, my God!

45:05.440 --> 45:07.591
- Oh, hey. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

45:07.680 --> 45:09.478
- I'm well. Where you going?
- Um...

45:09.600 --> 45:12.832
just the class that we're in together.

45:12.920 --> 45:15.480
Oh, yeah. Duh! I'll walk you there.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.199
Sounds great. Thanks.

45:18.280 --> 45:20.556
- Clare!
- Oh, hey, I'll see you at class.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.270
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Ryan, where have you been?

45:23.360 --> 45:24.316
Is everything okay?

45:24.400 --> 45:26.357
Can I ask you something?
It's gonna sound so...

45:26.920 --> 45:29.435
stupid and so crazy but, um...

45:30.600 --> 45:32.114
You know that wish box your dad got you?

45:32.200 --> 45:33.554
Have you made any wishes?

45:34.280 --> 45:36.078
- What? Why?
- So, have you wished?

45:36.680 --> 45:38.239
Why do you keep asking me that?

45:38.320 --> 45:39.231
Why don't you answer?

45:39.600 --> 45:40.920
Has it played any music yet?

45:41.000 --> 45:42.229
Ryan, who cares? I...

45:42.320 --> 45:43.310
"A blood price."

45:44.520 --> 45:46.477
That phrase Gina couldn't quite translate.

45:46.560 --> 45:47.471
It says...

45:47.920 --> 45:50.873
"When the music ends,
the blood price is paid."

45:51.560 --> 45:52.789
Um...

45:52.880 --> 45:54.030
tell her I said thanks.

45:57.480 --> 45:58.675
What? What is it?

45:58.920 --> 45:59.910
Ah, she's, uh...

46:02.040 --> 46:03.315
She's dead, Clare.

46:05.080 --> 46:05.991
Oh, my God!

46:06.720 --> 46:08.791
I'm so sorry. When did...

46:09.360 --> 46:10.271
A few nights ago.

46:11.360 --> 46:12.919
I don't even know what to say...

46:13.040 --> 46:14.394
Did it play its music then?

46:16.880 --> 46:18.234
I don't know what you're talking about.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.000
How'd you get to live in that mansion, again?

46:22.040 --> 46:24.191
We're gonna be late for class, Ryan.
Are you coming?

46:24.600 --> 46:25.511
Have you?

46:26.120 --> 46:27.076
Clare!

46:33.360 --> 46:36.717

southern China, the area of Guangzhou.</i>

46:36.800 --> 46:39.918

46:48.560 --> 46:49.471
Come join us.

46:53.240 --> 46:54.754
- Um, Paul...
- Okay.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.114
Oh, did that just happen?

46:58.360 --> 46:59.271
I think so.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.911
- Oh, oh.
- Oh! Burn.

47:04.920 --> 47:06.320
Still a nobody.

47:06.960 --> 47:07.950
How's it feel, winner?

47:16.640 --> 47:17.710
We're outta here.

47:21.480 --> 47:22.436
Haters gonna hate.

47:22.520 --> 47:24.193
There's not much you can do about it.

47:49.080 --> 47:52.312
I wish that I was
the most popular girl in school.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.514
Yeah. That'd be awesome.

Yes.

- What?
- Nothing.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.555

dope to say before I kissed you.

Hello?

Who are you?

50:55.880 --> 50:56.870
Hello?

51:05.040 --> 51:05.837
- Clare.
- Oh!

51:05.920 --> 51:07.240
What's going on?

51:09.160 --> 51:10.389
Nothing. I just...

51:10.480 --> 51:11.436
Um...

51:12.280 --> 51:13.999
I think that someone's following me.

51:14.080 --> 51:16.436
- What? Since when?
- Um...

51:18.440 --> 51:20.716
Since I got the music box.

52:03.680 --> 52:05.399
Mrs. Deluca, are you home? It's Clare.

52:08.600 --> 52:09.636
Mrs. Deluca?

Ugh!

Hello?

Hey. What's up?

53:13.280 --> 53:15.511
- So cute.
- Beyond cute.

53:19.320 --> 53:20.231
I don't know, Clare.

53:20.680 --> 53:22.433
Why don't you go ask your new friends?

53:23.840 --> 53:25.513
I mean, seriously, I don't get it.

53:25.760 --> 53:27.558
Why is everyone so into you lately?

53:27.920 --> 53:28.956
You're not that special.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.270
Truth.

53:33.040 --> 53:34.030
Hey.

53:34.120 --> 53:35.031
What's wrong?

53:39.040 --> 53:40.997
I need to talk to you guys about something.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.638
I don't know what's going on and...

53:44.360 --> 53:45.635
I don't know what to do.

53:49.240 --> 53:50.071
This is it?

53:50.160 --> 53:52.595
Don't... kick... that!

53:52.680 --> 53:54.399
Don't do that! Okay?

53:55.480 --> 53:56.675
Will someone say something?

53:57.880 --> 53:58.711
All right.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.553
I mean, have you ever heard of coincidence?

54:00.640 --> 54:02.552
- Oh, my God!
- That's all this is, Clare.

54:02.640 --> 54:03.756
Coincidence.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.879
Yeah, Clare. I don't know.

54:05.960 --> 54:08.111
I'm telling you,
I don't think so. I really don't.

54:08.200 --> 54:10.112
You wanna know what I think, Clare?

54:10.920 --> 54:11.831
Yeah.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.189
I think you're a selfish bowl of bitch sauce.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.917
If I had seven wishes,
you know what I'd have done?

54:18.000 --> 54:19.229
I would have wished for world peace

54:19.320 --> 54:22.119
and I would cure cancer.
I mean, you've used four whole wishes.

54:22.200 --> 54:24.032
- Five wishes.
- Five whole wishes already.

54:24.120 --> 54:26.316
And you didn't wish for anything
for me and June.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.278
Nothing. We're your best friends.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.273
Come on! Like, you didn't think, like...

54:30.360 --> 54:33.910
"Oh, well, I know Meredith wants
an internship at Everest Games

54:34.520 --> 54:37.319
- and June wants to get into Brown."
- You don't believe in this anyway!

54:37.400 --> 54:39.039
- So?
- Guys, are you serious?

54:39.120 --> 54:40.190
Do you think that if...

54:40.880 --> 54:42.872
if I believed this from the very beginning

54:42.960 --> 54:46.032
that I wouldn't have wished for my mom to...

54:46.800 --> 54:48.280
over you guys? I...

54:51.040 --> 54:52.759
It's okay. Say it.

54:53.400 --> 54:54.390
Nothing.

54:55.360 --> 54:56.953
Nothing. I just... I don't...

54:58.200 --> 55:00.192
think that I should be wishing anymore.

55:01.720 --> 55:03.234
I think you should throw it away.

55:03.760 --> 55:05.035
Doesn't that make the most sense?

55:05.120 --> 55:06.440
- Just get rid of it.
- Yeah.

55:08.640 --> 55:11.917
It says if I get rid of it,
all of my wishes will be undone.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.719
But if you really think people have died...

55:16.240 --> 55:18.197
aren't you a bad person if you keep it?

55:19.200 --> 55:22.193
Yeah. By "bad person"
June means, "psycho bitch."

55:22.840 --> 55:23.637
Oh!

55:23.720 --> 55:26.315
Nauseating Norma's outside,
and I'm so over this conversation.

55:29.240 --> 55:30.879
Just throw it away.

55:31.320 --> 55:32.390
You'll feel so much better.

55:33.440 --> 55:36.239
I mean, it hasn't really worked.
I still feel miserable.

55:36.760 --> 55:37.830
Toss it and it's done.

55:38.480 --> 55:39.755
You won't have to worry about it anymore.

56:02.160 --> 56:05.232

- Hi.

56:16.480 --> 56:18.995
Check this out.
Junie and I are still alive, dude.

56:19.080 --> 56:20.560
- Go figure, right.
- Okay.

56:20.640 --> 56:23.075
Just ignore her, Clare. So, did you do it?

56:25.920 --> 56:26.990
Did you throw it away?

56:28.480 --> 56:29.914
Yeah, right after you guys left.

56:30.720 --> 56:31.836
- Cool.
- Come on!

56:31.920 --> 56:34.071
Hey, where you guys going?
The hunt's about to start.

56:34.200 --> 56:35.759
Yeah. We'll be right back.

56:35.840 --> 56:36.910
Hurry up.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.719
Okay, be right back.

56:39.640 --> 56:40.790
- Okay.
- Kids, man.

56:42.200 --> 56:44.157
<i># Lightning in the fire #</i>

56:46.720 --> 56:50.430
<i># Somehow it always feels #
# Like the first time #</i>

56:52.120 --> 56:53.759
Wait, hang on. Paul, stop.

56:55.320 --> 56:56.390
Ow.

57:01.320 --> 57:02.231
What's this?

57:02.320 --> 57:03.231
Nothing.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.514
Let me see your phone.

57:09.520 --> 57:10.795
Now, or I'm out.

57:22.320 --> 57:23.436
They're just pictures of you.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.194
You're even cute when you're sleeping.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.314
You've been spying on me.

57:32.400 --> 57:34.471
- Well, yeah.
- What is wrong with you?

57:34.560 --> 57:35.710
Are you mad?

57:35.800 --> 57:37.120
Yes, I'm mad.

57:37.200 --> 57:38.919
You're smokin' when you're mad.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.719
I think maybe that we need a break.

57:40.800 --> 57:42.029
I don't.

57:43.120 --> 57:44.634
I was just trying to be nice.

57:44.920 --> 57:46.798
Paul, I'm breaking up with you.

57:47.440 --> 57:49.432
- I gotta get out of here.
- Clare, wait.

57:49.880 --> 57:51.837
This isn't over. Clare!

58:00.280 --> 58:02.351
Where is she? It's about to start.

58:13.520 --> 58:14.397
What? No.

58:14.480 --> 58:15.755
Hey, what happened?

58:15.840 --> 58:18.435
Junebug almost just got barbecued
and I saved her.

58:18.520 --> 58:19.840
Hey, got ninja, right?

58:20.280 --> 58:21.316
Ow-wah.

58:23.240 --> 58:24.959
Wait, guys. I just got the first clue.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.759
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

58:32.600 --> 58:33.670
Hey, buddy. It's Dad.

58:33.760 --> 58:36.878
I got a gig outside town so
I'm gonna be home around midnight. Okay?

58:37.520 --> 58:38.431
I love you.

58:41.600 --> 58:42.954
Shit!

58:59.680 --> 59:01.160
- Come on.
- Are you sure?

59:01.240 --> 59:02.435
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

59:02.720 --> 59:03.631
Look.

59:03.880 --> 59:06.554
- What goes up, must come down.
- Yes.

59:06.640 --> 59:08.074
You get it? Alright.

59:08.560 --> 59:10.040
Come on, guys, let's get this selfie.

59:13.320 --> 59:15.835
Boom. Five down, five more to go.

59:15.920 --> 59:17.957
Saxon's goin' down tonight.

59:18.480 --> 59:19.960
All right, where to next?

59:20.040 --> 59:20.951
Oh oh oh!

59:21.200 --> 59:23.157
- Holy... ballsack.
- What?

59:23.240 --> 59:24.913
Malformed Molly's in the building.

59:25.040 --> 59:26.872
Twenty-sixth floor. I gotta go.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.150
Are you kidding me?

59:28.520 --> 59:29.920
Don't hate. Don't hate.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.673
Meredith! Come on!

59:32.000 --> 59:33.992
Clare! Just give me five minutes, alright?

59:34.240 --> 59:38.200
And when I'm back,
Monster Mutant Master. Right here.

59:40.800 --> 59:41.756
Dammit.

59:47.640 --> 59:48.551
I didn't do it.

59:50.200 --> 59:51.190
Do what?

59:53.520 --> 59:56.991
The box. I still have it.
I couldn't throw it away.

59:58.280 --> 59:59.350
That's messed up, Clare.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.551
I know.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.957
I tried, I just... I couldn't do it.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.030
Aw man! I'm the shit!

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:48.431
Great!

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.151
Shit.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.835
- Meredith?
- Hey. Um...

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.716
Clare, I'm stuck, okay?

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.520
<i>Please get someone to help me.
I'm stuck in this stupid elevator.</i>

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.831
Uh...

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.310
Yeah, sure.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:39.471
Argh.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.550
Crap!

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.715
Hey, um, never mind.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.389
Dammit!

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.391
No!

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.590
Clare!

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.160
Meredith!

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.360
Meredith!

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.996
Meredith!

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.919
This is your fault.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.830
All your fault.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.511
Hey, come on.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.439
No.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.553
Come on. Let's get you outta here.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.991
Come on.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.111
You know the number on the box
that we couldn't figure out?

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.751
Well, I did.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.474
It's a military ID number belonging to
an airman by the name of Arthur Sands.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.471
That's him.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.470
He was stationed in China
at the end of World War ll.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:51.110
A few years later he opened up a
very successful car dealership in Jersey.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.751
He lost his best friend in a freak accident.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.477
Here's the kicker.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.190
That's him six months later.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.916
Oh, my God!

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.120
After his suicide,
his wife was institutionalized.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.796
She swore a music box
had destroyed her family.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.515
In the last five years or so...

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.271
the box resurfaced again in Cleveland,
with a man named Lawrence Hart.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:15.517
<i>He wins the lottery, marries his high
school sweetheart and has two daughters.</i>

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.750
<i>A perfect life.</i>

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.153
<i>Until people around him start dying off.</i>

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.759
<i>His daughters drowned,
his wife died in a car accident</i>

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.153
<i>and Hart lost his mind.</i>

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.877
<i>He barricades himself in his house and
that's where he dies, in a massive fire.</i>

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.231
<i>You know what's weird?</i>

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.914
<i>What's left of his estate is
a few blocks from your house, Clare.</i>

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.080
There was another phrase on the box
I don't think you saw.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.354
<i>It was a warning.</i>

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.917
<i>"After seven wishes,
the</i> Yaoguai <i>claims the soul."</i>

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.270
That's its final price.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.800
- Hey.
- What?

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.235
How many wishes have you made?

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.514
I've made five wishes.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.037
Jesus, Clare.
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:37.991
I'm sorry, but...

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.077
"But" how is there a "but?" People are dead!

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.470
It was just nice to be normal for a while.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.391
That's your excuse?

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:44.675
What'd you wish for, anyway?

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.830
- That nice house?
- No.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.998
Oh now, bullshit! People are dead, Clare.
You can't just wish that away.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.150
You can't take that back.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.993
I know, and I said I was sorry.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.037
I didn't know that any of this would happen.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:54.997
Know what I wish?

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.231
I wish I never met you. That's what I wish.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.190
It's my fault.
And I know that I have to get rid of it.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.513
Will you please help me?

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.030
Please, Ryan?

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.240
Okay, let's do it.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.830
Okay.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.230
Bitch!

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.120
She was my best friend, Clare.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.470
I'm sorry.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.911
What are you doing here?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.798
Why haven't you answered my texts?

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.473
You need to leave right now.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.750
What if I said...

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.594
I don't want to live without you.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.670
And I don't want you...

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.796
to live without me.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.392
Please. Just, just leave.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.797
- So, we're done?
- Oh, my God!

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.311
Yes.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.310
I love you, Clare.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.671
Where is it?

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.112
What, what do you mean?

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.629
I don't know.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:17.430
It's...

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.511
I don't know. It was right there last night.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.710
It was right in there. I...

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.791
Oh...

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.236
What does that mean?

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.591
I...

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.796
Maybe it's done with you.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.116
Maybe it's over.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.479
Well, what now? What would I do? What...

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.880
You move on with your life.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.477
You can do it.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.993
That's easy to say, Ryan.

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.752
No, it's easy to wish.

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.274
I liked it. I liked having it.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.033
It made me feel special.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.075
Is there anything you wished for
that you can't live without?

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.399
- No.
- See, you don't need it.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.310
Dad?

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.350
What's going on?

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.712
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:32.960
It's unbelievable. I mean, who forgets
to pay their taxes for ten years?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.832
Your mother's crazy Uncle August.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.837
Well, here we are.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.353
Home sweet home.

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:53.953
<i># You're a curse #
# A disease, and I caught it #</i>

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.557
<i># Like a drug, slowly pulsing #</i>

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.233
Happy birthday, Clare.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.554
<i># And I don't want it anymore #</i>

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.840

<i># I go round #</i>

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.357
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.679

Recycle first.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.316
Gross.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.554
Mmmm, hot.

<i># You're going somewhere, #

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.354
You stole it?

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.197
You couldn't get rid of it.
You saw what it did to Meredith.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.794
I'm just trying to protect you, okay?

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.793
Okay, so you think that you can control it.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.200
You think you can, Clare?

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.791
Really?

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.315
Are you crazy?

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.831
Why would you bring it here
in the first place?

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.957
'Cause I have two little sisters at home.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.680
Give it back. Right now.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.159
After everything that's happened?

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.960
Yes, June.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.400
What's wrong with you?

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.795
No! Clare, no, stop it. Clare!

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.673
You see what it's done. This is a bad idea.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.320
- June, go away.
- Stop, listen to me! Just stop!

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.790
Clare, come on! No, no, no. Clare, come here.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.315
- Just give it to me, Clare. Stop.
- Let go, June!

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.551
- Let go! Let go!
- Clare?

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.875
- Clare!
- No!

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.830
June?

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.556
June? Is she going to be okay?

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.994
What is wrong with you?

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.471
Clare?

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.517
- Go away!
- I thought we were done with this.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.590
I'm not ready yet.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.194
You can't keep it. You know that.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.999
- You have to get rid of it!
- You don't understand.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:50.991
I'm not ready yet!

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.355
What about everything we talked about?

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:53.556
I won't wish anymore, okay?

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.319
Okay, it'll be fine. I just won't wish.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.880
I'm gonna hang on to it for a while.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.553
Clare, please, you're not hearing yourself.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.438
You can't control it. It's controlling you!

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.631
Go away! Okay?

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.279
Please go away.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.030
I have two wishes left
and if you do not go away,

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.954
I will use one on you,
I swear I'll use it on you.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.711
Go away!

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.559
You can't keep running from this!

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.479
I know, I know what to do.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.031
I know, I know what to do,
I know when to... Okay.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.595
Okay.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.399
If I had... No.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.115
If I just don't make any more wishes,
everything will be fine.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.318
Everything will be fine.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.673
Clare? School just called.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.159
Clare? What's going on?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:54.990
Get down here!

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.550
Okay.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.593
I have two wishes left.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.598
I have two wishes left.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.631
Two wishes.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.074
I wish my mother never committed suicide.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.915
Oh, God.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.431
Clare?

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.750
Mom?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:45.877
Mom?

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.834
I missed you so much!

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.038
You missed me so much? What?

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.116
Happy birthday! We got you cake!

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.437
- Sssh!
- And presents!

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.273
Okay, come on. What's the holdup?
Downstairs, kiddo. Chop-chop.

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.717
Al'right. Here it is.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.120
Yay!

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.238
<i># Happy birthday... #</i>

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.955
<i># Happy birthday... #</i>

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.359
Happy birthday, kiddo.

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:25.351
Thank you, Dad.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.231
Make a wish.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.790
Clare?

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.396
I'm up here.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.319
Come open your presents.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.751
Okay.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.154
<i>Mommy! Come on, Max!</i>

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.355
This is your fault.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.600
This is your fault. Everything is your fault.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.236
Oh, my God!

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:58.996
What?

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.269
No. No!

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.990
Yeah, right there is good.

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.119
- Yeah.
- You think so, man?

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.795
No, no, no, no!

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.032
Dad! Dad!

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.952
Dad!

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.838
Dad!

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.956
- Oh, my God! My God!
- No!

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.310
Jon!

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.230
No...

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.476
Argh!

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.553
- No!
- Are you...

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.597
What happened? Are you...

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.115
Jonathan! No!

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.314
No! No!

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.357
I've got one wish left.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.878
I know how to beat you!

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.430
I wanna go back!

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.552
I wanna go back before I got you!

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.196
I wanna go back.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:16.560
My final wish is I wanna go back
to the morning my dad found you.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.317
I wanna go back right now!

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.435
Max?

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.231
Hi, Max!

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.479
Mmm... hi.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.360
Oh, who's a good boy!

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.676
Wait.

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.031
Wait, wait, wait. Wait! Wait!

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.716
Wait! Wait!

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.792
Wait! Hang on, hang on!

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.871
<i>I'm not awake right now.</i>

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.952
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- Nothing. Hi.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.316
I just wanted to, you know, hear your voice.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.996
<i>Seriously? You don't need a kidney
or some ridiculous words of wisdom?</i>

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.833
- No, I just, no...
- <i>Alright, you know</i>

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.958
- <i>I'm gonna go back to sleep, okay? Night!</i>
- Okay, okay.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.276
Dad!

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.950
- Hey!
- Hey. What's all this?

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.514
Um, nothing. I just... um I was just
wondering if I could go with you guys.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.955
You know, like old times.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.153
- Yeah. Get in.
- Awesome.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.110
Sure, it'll be like old times.
Be our good luck charm.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.719
Aw, you look so nice.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.555
Clare, you find anything?

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.869
I found...

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.760
I found these. I don't know
what you could use them for.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.910
Maybe around the house?
I don't know, they're kind of neat.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.998
- Yeah, I can do something with these.
- Yeah?

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.037
Hey, Carl. Check it out.

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.040
Told you my kid has an eye.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.118
You always were my good luck charm.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.156
You gotta come with us again.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.271
Yeah, maybe I will.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.760
I have to get to school,
but have fun today. Love you.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:54.751
Love you too, buddy.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.359
- Yeah, thank you so much.
- You got it.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.680
Let's go buddy.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.954
Ryan! Ryan, hey.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.550
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh, sure.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.990
Okay, um...

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.032
First off, I just wanted to say, um...

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.030
I'm sorry for the whole McFarts thing.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:28.876
Wait. What? Really?

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.560
Yeah. Um...

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.953
But you know what, maybe in the
multiverse, that didn't happen.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.474
- Hold on, you dig on multiverses?
- Yeah.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.951
And, also, maybe in the multiverse,
we're really good friends.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.711
Maybe... we're even dating.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.637
Well... have we done it?

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.476
No, not yet.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.470
I have also met your cousin, Gina.
Hung out in her loft and everything.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.911
Okay, you're freaking me out right now.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:58.990
Yeah, good.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:00.955
'Cause I need a favor.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.192
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy but...

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.914
please don't open this.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.674
Just... just bury it. No shortcuts.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.559
Uh... okay.

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.790
What's in it for me?

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.435
Dinner, if you want?

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.073
And maybe we could talk more
on this whole multiverse thing?

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.034
Yeah, and you can tell me how you
know my cousin and that she has a loft.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.995
- Done.
- Cool.

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.591
Dude!

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.111
I'll see you around.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:03.949
I didn't see her.

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.800
I just didn't see her.
