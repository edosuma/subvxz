00:40.669 --> 00:41.897
Chances are

00:42.004 --> 00:45.064
you've never heard of
Preston Thomas Tucker...

00:45.173 --> 00:46.071
dreamer,

00:46.174 --> 00:47.072
inventor,

00:47.175 --> 00:48.403
visionary,

00:48.510 --> 00:50.910
a man ahead of his time.

00:55.517 --> 00:56.916
Pretty, isn't it?

00:57.019 --> 00:59.579
Mr. Tucker's car
has everything...

00:59.688 --> 01:01.519
pop-out safety windows,
rear motor.

01:01.623 --> 01:04.489
Oh, but I'm getting
ahead of my story.

01:04.593 --> 01:07.494
The first time
he ever saw an automobile,

01:07.596 --> 01:09.996
he was just
a young boy.

01:10.098 --> 01:11.497
In his excitement,

01:11.600 --> 01:14.501
he found the wheels
passing over his feet.

01:14.603 --> 01:16.503
The muddy road was soft.

01:16.605 --> 01:18.004
He wasn't hurt.

01:18.106 --> 01:21.007
That was the first view
of the machine

01:21.109 --> 01:24.010
that was to mold
his thoughts and actions

01:24.112 --> 01:25.511
most of his life.

01:25.614 --> 01:28.515
Determined to learn
how cars were made,

01:28.617 --> 01:30.016
he went to Detroit,

01:30.118 --> 01:32.018
where he met Vera Fuqua.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.020
They were married,

01:34.122 --> 01:37.114
and, wasting no time,
began a family.

01:37.225 --> 01:40.126
He never lost sight
of his dream

01:40.228 --> 01:41.627
to design
and manufacture

01:41.730 --> 01:43.755
the finest automobile
ever made.

01:44.866 --> 01:47.266
He spent
every minute he could

01:47.369 --> 01:48.768
at the Indianapolis
Speedway,

01:48.870 --> 01:50.770
teaming up
with Harry Miller,

01:50.872 --> 01:53.773
one of the greatest
designers of racing cars

01:53.875 --> 01:55.274
who ever lived.

01:57.145 --> 02:00.046
In 1936, Mr. Tucker
saw the war clouds

02:00.148 --> 02:01.479
looming on the horizon

02:01.583 --> 02:02.982
and began working

02:03.085 --> 02:06.077
on a high-speed
combat car.

02:06.188 --> 02:08.588
It was bulletproof,
had air conditioning,

02:08.690 --> 02:11.250
and mounted
a power-operated gun turret.

02:11.360 --> 02:14.761
The combat car was
turned down by the military.

02:14.863 --> 02:17.263
It had one drawback,
they said.

02:17.366 --> 02:18.765
It was too fast.

02:18.867 --> 02:21.768
The War Department's
policy then was

02:21.870 --> 02:25.772
no combat car should go
over 35 miles an hour.

02:28.810 --> 02:30.505
His gun turret,
however,

02:30.612 --> 02:33.410
was immediately
put into service.

02:33.515 --> 02:36.109
Who knows how many
brave Americans

02:36.218 --> 02:38.618
owe their lives
to Tucker's turret?

02:38.720 --> 02:40.244
Where were they built?

02:40.355 --> 02:43.256
In the most practical
place Tucker imagined...

02:43.358 --> 02:45.656
the barn
by his Michigan home

02:45.761 --> 02:48.195
where he
and his family lived.

03:04.279 --> 03:05.678
Oh, my God.

03:12.187 --> 03:14.621
Hold that tiger

03:14.723 --> 03:16.953
Hold that tiger

03:17.058 --> 03:18.992
Hold that tiger

03:19.094 --> 03:20.755
Hold that tiger

03:20.862 --> 03:22.420
Hold that tiger

03:22.531 --> 03:24.965
Come on out, girl.

03:25.066 --> 03:25.964
What's this?

03:26.067 --> 03:28.968
Did you put this
in my car?

03:29.070 --> 03:29.968
No.

03:30.071 --> 03:32.471
Did you?
What is this thing?

03:32.574 --> 03:33.472
Open it.

03:33.575 --> 03:34.974
What is it?

03:35.076 --> 03:37.977
My friends,
you are in for one doozie.

03:38.079 --> 03:39.979
What can
I call this?

03:40.081 --> 03:42.072
It's history
in the making.

03:42.184 --> 03:44.584
Is there anything
you want to explain

03:44.686 --> 03:46.745
about the dogs?

03:46.855 --> 03:50.313
Oh... well, I traded
the old Packard for them.

03:52.127 --> 03:53.526
One dozen
trained dogs.

03:53.628 --> 03:56.529
What will we do
with a dozen dogs?

03:56.631 --> 03:58.531
It was a great trade.

03:58.633 --> 04:01.466
Are you dying
to know what's in here?

04:01.570 --> 04:02.468
Huh? No?

04:02.571 --> 04:03.970
- Yes.
- Yes.

04:04.072 --> 04:05.369
You're dying, huh?

04:05.474 --> 04:07.271
Gallup took a poll

04:07.375 --> 04:09.707
about what Americans want
when the war's over.

04:09.811 --> 04:11.836
87 of Americans said

04:11.947 --> 04:15.713
the first thing
they want is a new car.

04:15.817 --> 04:18.216
Which would the public
rather buy?

04:18.320 --> 04:20.220
The same
old models made

04:20.322 --> 04:21.812
before the war or...

04:23.859 --> 04:25.759
the car of tomorrow...

04:26.995 --> 04:28.360
today.

04:28.463 --> 04:31.227
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

04:31.333 --> 04:34.234
Looks like he's going
90 mph standing still.

04:34.336 --> 04:37.396
Know who's going to
build these cars? We are.

04:37.506 --> 04:40.100
We'll put the Big Three
out of business.

04:40.208 --> 04:42.768
Who will we sell
them to? Buck Rogers?

04:42.878 --> 04:46.177
Under the hood,
we've got luggage.

04:46.281 --> 04:49.546
Engine's in the rear
where it ought to be.

04:49.651 --> 04:52.085
Look at this.
Individual torque converters.

04:52.187 --> 04:53.279
You're crazy!

04:53.388 --> 04:56.687
You'd have to have wheel tracks
70 inches wide.

04:56.791 --> 04:58.224
Dinner's ready!

04:58.326 --> 04:59.350
All right.
Let's go!

04:59.461 --> 05:00.428
How many?

05:01.696 --> 05:02.594
Everybody.

05:02.697 --> 05:04.597
How about
the U.S. Army?

05:04.699 --> 05:06.564
You boys hungry?

05:06.668 --> 05:09.637
Oh, Millie!
Millie!

05:09.738 --> 05:12.332
And our best
dog food, huh?

05:15.310 --> 05:17.471
Hold that tiger

05:17.579 --> 05:19.103
Hold that tiger

05:19.214 --> 05:20.977
Hold that tiger...

05:22.250 --> 05:25.151
How much you going
to tell him?

05:25.253 --> 05:26.151
Everything.

05:26.254 --> 05:28.154
Coming through.
Got dirty dishes.

05:28.256 --> 05:29.655
They'll fall on you.

05:29.758 --> 05:30.656
Don't trip!

05:30.759 --> 05:33.125
The fenders...
Light.

05:33.228 --> 05:34.627
Who's this guy,
Karatz?

05:34.729 --> 05:36.128
He's a business man.

05:36.231 --> 05:38.631
I met him
on the train.

05:38.733 --> 05:39.631
Finance.

05:39.734 --> 05:40.632
Finance?

05:40.735 --> 05:42.134
Come here, Junior.

05:45.073 --> 05:45.971
Who's that?

05:46.074 --> 05:48.474
The man I've been
talking about.

05:48.577 --> 05:49.601
Abe Karatz.

05:50.712 --> 05:52.111
Good luck, honey.

05:52.213 --> 05:54.113
We'll be
in the den.

05:57.752 --> 05:59.481
Look at him.

05:59.588 --> 06:01.488
Yeah. He's scary.

06:01.590 --> 06:02.921
He's not scary.

06:03.024 --> 06:04.548
He's from New York.

06:04.659 --> 06:05.557
Abe.

06:06.795 --> 06:08.194
I appreciate
your coming.

06:08.296 --> 06:09.695
How long
between trains?

06:09.798 --> 06:12.699
You like living in
the middle of nowhere?

06:12.801 --> 06:15.702
You want coffee at
2 a.m., you'd die first.

06:15.804 --> 06:17.203
Yeah, or make one.

06:17.305 --> 06:19.205
Who wants coffee
at 2 a.m.?

06:19.307 --> 06:22.208
You chew the fat
with the waitress.

06:22.310 --> 06:23.709
Here you
look around,

06:23.812 --> 06:25.404
there's nothing
but scenery.

06:25.513 --> 06:26.912
We're stuck
with that.

06:27.015 --> 06:29.415
How do you like
your coffee?

06:29.517 --> 06:30.916
In the city.

06:35.156 --> 06:36.555
Double fives again,

06:36.658 --> 06:38.558
and he does it.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.093
Cars?

06:41.763 --> 06:44.527
You brought me
here for cars?

06:46.768 --> 06:49.669
Does that look
like a car to you?

06:49.771 --> 06:52.672
That is a gold mine
I'm handing you

06:52.774 --> 06:54.173
on a silver platter.

06:54.275 --> 06:55.173
Forget it.

06:56.277 --> 06:57.676
You got no chance.

06:57.779 --> 06:59.679
How can you
say that?

06:59.781 --> 07:02.113
You haven't even
heard my ideas.

07:02.217 --> 07:03.275
Ideas?

07:03.385 --> 07:05.114
Einstein's
in the idea business,

07:05.220 --> 07:06.619
making
numbers so high

07:06.721 --> 07:08.120
only dogs hear them.

07:08.223 --> 07:10.123
But what's it
cost him?

07:10.225 --> 07:11.123
Paper, pencils.

07:11.226 --> 07:12.625
To manufacture a car,

07:12.727 --> 07:14.627
you need millions
of dollars.

07:14.729 --> 07:17.630
Well, that is what
Wall Street is for...

07:17.732 --> 07:20.223
to float
stock issues, Abe.

07:20.335 --> 07:22.269
Who are you?

07:22.370 --> 07:23.769
What do you know?

07:23.872 --> 07:25.931
Any experience
on Wall Street?

07:26.041 --> 07:26.939
It's revolutionary.

07:27.042 --> 07:29.738
This is how cars are
going to be made.

07:29.844 --> 07:32.108
Abe, and with
your connections...

07:32.213 --> 07:33.612
I don't have
connections.

07:33.715 --> 07:35.808
I have connections
with connections.

07:35.917 --> 07:38.579
Speaking for them,
myself, and God...

07:38.687 --> 07:41.622
Him, too...
forget about it.

07:41.723 --> 07:43.088
You got no chance.

08:16.257 --> 08:18.088
Well, think about it.

08:19.427 --> 08:20.951
Drive safely.

08:21.062 --> 08:21.994
Yes, sir.

08:46.121 --> 08:47.281
Preston?

08:50.625 --> 08:51.557
Preston?

09:02.904 --> 09:04.303
Pile in, cutie.

09:04.405 --> 09:06.134
Who wants ice cream?

09:06.241 --> 09:07.640
Let's go to Doc's!

09:07.742 --> 09:08.640
Everybody!

09:08.743 --> 09:10.142
Man your positions.

09:10.245 --> 09:13.078
See if we can break
our record time.

09:13.181 --> 09:14.580
Hurry up! Come on!

09:14.682 --> 09:16.081
I've got
my position.

09:26.094 --> 09:28.995
It was pathetic
how he loved the idea.

09:29.097 --> 09:31.998
Embarrassing
to see a man like that

09:32.100 --> 09:35.001
trying so hard to
play my harp strings.

09:35.103 --> 09:38.470
I'm going to make him
sweat a while first.

09:40.742 --> 09:42.369
Watch this baby
accelerate!

09:43.478 --> 09:44.376
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

09:44.479 --> 09:45.776
Hold that tiger

09:45.880 --> 09:47.142
Hold that tiger

09:47.248 --> 09:48.647
Sounds like Tucker again.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.775
Yep! That's him.
Let's go!

09:50.885 --> 09:52.785
Hold that tiger

09:52.887 --> 09:54.081
Hold that tiger

09:54.189 --> 09:55.747
Hold that tiger

09:57.458 --> 09:58.948
Where's that tiger

09:59.060 --> 10:00.493
Where's that tiger

10:00.595 --> 10:02.256
Here's that tiger

10:02.363 --> 10:04.024
Where's that tiger

10:04.132 --> 10:05.565
Here's that tiger

10:05.667 --> 10:07.692
Where's that tiger

10:07.802 --> 10:08.734
Here's that tiger

10:08.837 --> 10:11.203
Do do do do
do do do do

10:11.306 --> 10:13.433
Do do do do
deedle da da dum

10:13.541 --> 10:15.304
Da da da
deedle da da da

10:15.410 --> 10:17.674
Deedle da da dum...

10:17.779 --> 10:19.178
Who wants
ice cream?

10:21.616 --> 10:23.015
How you doing, Doc?

10:23.117 --> 10:25.517
Ok, if you don't
include everything.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.645
How about sodas
all around?

10:27.755 --> 10:29.222
Triple scoops
tonight.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.222
Triple scoops.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.724
Chocolate,
pistachio, strawberry.

10:31.826 --> 10:34.659
You can
mix them all up, OK?

10:34.762 --> 10:36.229
Strawberry soda.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.730
Hey, uh...

10:37.832 --> 10:39.663
ain't those
prefab houses something?

10:39.767 --> 10:42.668
How do you know
they're any good?

10:42.770 --> 10:44.897
They're not
even built yet.

10:45.006 --> 10:47.338
It says so
in the magazine.

10:47.442 --> 10:48.340
Johnny, stop.

10:48.443 --> 10:50.411
Yuck! He spilled it.

10:50.511 --> 10:52.570
Noble, stop
eating my sundae.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.079
Stop it, Johnny.

10:54.182 --> 10:56.309
Hey, does anybody
want strawberry?

10:56.417 --> 10:58.282
Hold that tiger

10:58.386 --> 10:59.876
Hold that tiger

10:59.988 --> 11:01.319
Working with a writer,

11:01.422 --> 11:04.323
Tucker got an article
about the car published

11:04.425 --> 11:05.824
in pic magazine.

11:05.927 --> 11:07.827
But nobody,
not even Tucker,

11:07.929 --> 11:09.692
was prepared
for what happened.

11:09.797 --> 11:11.196
Within a week,

11:11.299 --> 11:12.698
150,000 letters
poured in

11:12.800 --> 11:14.700
from all over
the country.

11:14.802 --> 11:16.201
"I want a Tucker."

11:16.304 --> 11:18.704
"Where can I
buy a Tucker?"

11:18.806 --> 11:20.706
"Can I get
a dealership?"

11:20.808 --> 11:23.936
Overnight, the nation
had gone Tucker crazy.

11:26.147 --> 11:28.547
Just because Tucker
builds a car

11:28.650 --> 11:31.551
doesn't mean he can
mass produce it.

11:33.554 --> 11:37.684
So... what do we need
to make this work?

11:39.627 --> 11:41.527
Well, we need a car.

11:41.629 --> 11:43.028
A car we got.

11:43.131 --> 11:44.530
A working prototype?

11:44.632 --> 11:46.964
Says so
in the magazine.

11:47.068 --> 11:49.969
We, uh, also
will have to have

11:50.071 --> 11:51.368
some big
Detroit names

11:51.472 --> 11:53.372
for the board...
the prospectus.

11:53.474 --> 11:54.498
Like who?

11:54.609 --> 11:56.509
Well, there was a fellow,

11:56.611 --> 11:59.011
vice president
at Ford many years,

11:59.113 --> 12:00.171
Robert Bennington.

12:00.281 --> 12:02.613
He's president at
Plymouth right now,

12:02.717 --> 12:04.582
but he's being
kicked upstairs.

12:04.686 --> 12:06.153
We might get him.

12:06.254 --> 12:09.246
Will he want a say
in running things?

12:09.357 --> 12:10.255
A say?

12:10.358 --> 12:12.155
Bennington will
run the company.

12:12.260 --> 12:14.694
Tucker may not
go for that.

12:14.796 --> 12:16.195
People don't
buy stock.

12:16.297 --> 12:19.061
They buy people
they can trust

12:19.167 --> 12:20.566
or believe they can.

12:20.668 --> 12:21.999
If what's-his-name...

12:22.103 --> 12:23.127
Tucker.

12:23.237 --> 12:26.104
If Tucker's going to be
a pain in the ass...

12:26.207 --> 12:28.607
Don't worry.
He's a good man.

12:28.710 --> 12:30.610
What else do we need?

12:30.712 --> 12:33.545
We need
a factory, hmm?

12:33.648 --> 12:36.208
You get Bennington,
whatever it takes.

12:37.318 --> 12:38.751
I'll get the factory.

12:41.189 --> 12:42.087
Thank you.

12:44.659 --> 12:46.923
Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.

12:47.028 --> 12:48.461
Norfolk,
Virginia.

12:48.563 --> 12:50.588
Norfolk,
Virginia.

12:50.698 --> 12:52.188
Omaha,
Nebraska.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.858
Omaha,
Nebraska.

12:53.968 --> 12:54.900
Wow. Look.

12:55.003 --> 12:58.200
Here... here's one
from Anchorage, Alaska.

12:58.306 --> 13:00.604
Oh! That's the first
one from there.

13:00.708 --> 13:03.609
Abe should have
been here an hour ago.

13:03.711 --> 13:06.111
You know the trains
now, darling.

13:06.214 --> 13:07.613
They're always late.

13:15.590 --> 13:16.921
Who's that?

13:22.997 --> 13:25.761
Could I have
a few moments with you?

13:25.867 --> 13:27.266
I'm waiting
for somebody.

13:27.368 --> 13:28.266
Five minutes.

13:28.369 --> 13:30.098
Bye, daddy!

13:30.204 --> 13:31.102
What for?

13:31.205 --> 13:33.105
To sell you
something, sir.

13:33.207 --> 13:34.105
What?

13:35.243 --> 13:36.710
Me.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.313
All right.
Five minutes.

13:40.415 --> 13:42.815
Thank you.
I'm Alex Tremulis, sir.

13:42.917 --> 13:45.818
I'll be getting out
of the Air Force

13:45.920 --> 13:47.319
in a few weeks.

13:47.422 --> 13:49.822
Before that, I studied
automotive engineering.

13:49.924 --> 13:52.825
Since I saw that article
about your car,

13:52.927 --> 13:54.758
it's been
driving me crazy.

13:54.862 --> 13:57.262
I made some 3-D
perspective drawings.

13:57.365 --> 13:59.595
If you
wouldn't mind, sir,

13:59.700 --> 14:01.531
taking a look at them.

14:01.636 --> 14:04.036
What you did
with the streamlining

14:04.138 --> 14:05.036
was fantastic.

14:05.139 --> 14:08.040
But if we took that
one step further,

14:08.142 --> 14:10.042
if we applied
real aerodynamics,

14:10.144 --> 14:11.543
like a rocketship

14:11.646 --> 14:12.704
to a family car...

14:12.814 --> 14:14.304
You changed my doors.

14:14.415 --> 14:15.313
Yes, sir.

14:15.416 --> 14:17.816
You only have
31 inches headroom.

14:17.919 --> 14:19.819
An average-size
person needs 36.

14:19.921 --> 14:22.617
But every time
you open the door,

14:22.723 --> 14:24.384
they hit the curb.

14:24.492 --> 14:27.518
I made them open up
like an airplane.

14:27.628 --> 14:29.027
Time's up, kid.

14:29.130 --> 14:30.529
Two more minutes, sir.

14:30.631 --> 14:33.031
Want a job?
You got it.

14:33.134 --> 14:34.761
In the design
department?

14:34.869 --> 14:37.269
Kid, you are
the design department.

14:37.371 --> 14:39.931
Ahh.

14:40.041 --> 14:41.941
Abe!
Did you find it?

14:43.878 --> 14:45.539
Tucker.

14:45.646 --> 14:48.046
I have a lot
to tell you.

14:48.149 --> 14:49.912
It was
a good meeting.

14:51.052 --> 14:51.950
Jimmy!

14:52.053 --> 14:52.951
Hello.

14:54.388 --> 14:55.446
Jimmy Sakiyama,

14:55.556 --> 14:57.353
Abe Karatz,
my partner.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.688
Hi. Nice to meet you.

14:59.794 --> 15:00.852
How do you do?

15:01.996 --> 15:04.726
Tell Eddie we'll be
in the dining room.

15:04.832 --> 15:05.730
You bet.

15:06.834 --> 15:09.064
Hey, didn't they
put the Japs

15:09.170 --> 15:10.569
in camp someplace?

15:10.671 --> 15:12.138
He's not a Jap.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.639
He's an engineer.

15:13.741 --> 15:15.140
He's still a Jap.

15:15.243 --> 15:18.110
Jimmy and me,
we've been together 15 years.

15:18.212 --> 15:20.612
He's in my custody
to work.

15:20.715 --> 15:23.149
But his parents,
his 12-year-old sister,

15:23.251 --> 15:25.879
they're in a relocation camp
in Colorado,

15:25.987 --> 15:28.387
if that makes you
feel better.

15:33.861 --> 15:35.294
Meshugana.

15:35.396 --> 15:37.387
Hi there,
Mr. Karatz.

15:37.498 --> 15:38.897
How are you?

15:40.368 --> 15:42.768
Which leaves three
war surplus plants.

15:42.870 --> 15:44.269
It's a long shot.

15:44.372 --> 15:46.272
Everybody's
trying to get them,

15:46.374 --> 15:48.274
but it's
worth a try.

15:48.376 --> 15:50.276
One of them
is perfect.

15:50.378 --> 15:52.869
Nice, little.

15:52.980 --> 15:54.880
The other
is too big.

15:54.982 --> 15:57.382
Costs twice as much
to retool.

15:57.485 --> 16:00.977
We could swing it
if we had to.

16:01.088 --> 16:02.851
What's the third?

16:02.957 --> 16:05.653
Ah, impossible.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.159
The Dodge plant

16:07.261 --> 16:10.162
where they made
the B-29s in Chicago.

16:10.264 --> 16:12.164
Hmm. What's wrong with that?

16:14.001 --> 16:15.400
For one thing,

16:15.503 --> 16:18.233
it covers 475 acres
with 16 buildings.

16:18.339 --> 16:21.240
One of them
is 73 acres long.

16:21.342 --> 16:22.468
One building...

16:22.577 --> 16:25.910
the biggest building in the world
under one roof.

16:26.013 --> 16:27.207
It's perfect.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.752
You'll love it
in Chicago.

16:39.860 --> 16:42.260
Listen, they've got
a department store...

16:42.363 --> 16:45.025
one of the biggest
in the world.

16:45.132 --> 16:46.531
Oh, everybody
shops there.

16:46.634 --> 16:47.896
You'll love it.

16:49.604 --> 16:51.162
Fantastic!

16:51.272 --> 16:52.170
Oh!

16:53.541 --> 16:56.442
I can build everything
I ever dreamed of

16:56.544 --> 16:57.943
in this plant, Abe...

16:58.045 --> 17:01.310
sports cars, family cars,
convertibles, trucks,

17:01.415 --> 17:02.643
even airplanes!

17:02.750 --> 17:06.413
Just talk the government
into giving it to us.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.919
Did you reach them?

17:08.021 --> 17:10.422
Yep. We finally
got our meeting

17:10.523 --> 17:13.425
with the War Assets Administration
in Washington.

17:13.527 --> 17:14.425
Monday. 3:00.

17:14.528 --> 17:15.926
Oh, that's no good.

17:16.030 --> 17:17.122
What?

17:17.231 --> 17:19.131
It's got to be
lunch someplace.

17:19.233 --> 17:22.134
Do you realize the trouble
I went through?

17:22.236 --> 17:24.568
With roast beef.

17:24.672 --> 17:26.537
Rare. Very rare.

17:28.142 --> 17:31.077
Every 25 seconds

17:31.178 --> 17:33.612
somebody
is killed or crippled

17:33.714 --> 17:35.477
in an automobile accident.

17:35.583 --> 17:38.882
Now 60
of all nighttime accidents

17:38.986 --> 17:40.385
happen on the curb

17:40.488 --> 17:42.388
because there's
a blind spot

17:42.490 --> 17:44.856
between the time
the wheel's turned

17:44.959 --> 17:48.190
and the time your headlights
get where you're going.

17:48.296 --> 17:50.526
When you turn
a Tucker wheel,

17:50.631 --> 17:53.532
you also turn the fenders
and the headlights.

17:53.634 --> 17:57.035
You see where you're going
before you get there.

17:57.138 --> 17:58.537
This woman was thrown

17:58.639 --> 18:00.903
through the windshield
of her car.

18:02.009 --> 18:05.103
Tucker windshields
pop out.

18:05.212 --> 18:08.704
And to make sure
nobody's face gets cut,

18:08.816 --> 18:10.579
we have shatterproof glass.

18:10.685 --> 18:13.415
We also have seat belts.

18:13.521 --> 18:14.647
Now, why?

18:14.755 --> 18:16.154
Tell me why, gentlemen,

18:16.257 --> 18:18.657
has the Big Three
in Detroit

18:18.759 --> 18:21.421
been allowed to make
billions of dollars

18:21.529 --> 18:23.929
without spending one dime
on safety?

18:24.031 --> 18:26.363
What I know,
what you know,

18:26.467 --> 18:27.832
what the public knows...

18:27.935 --> 18:31.302
is that they don't
give a damn about people.

18:31.405 --> 18:33.805
All they care about
is profits.

18:33.908 --> 18:35.637
Let me tell you
something,

18:35.743 --> 18:39.509
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,

18:39.613 --> 18:41.012
the entire
automobile industry

18:41.115 --> 18:43.015
is guilty
of criminal negligence.

18:43.117 --> 18:46.018
And if it were up to me,

18:46.120 --> 18:49.021
they'd be tried and
convicted of manslaughter.

18:51.359 --> 18:52.792
Thank you, gentlemen.

18:52.893 --> 18:55.794
Thank you for the time
you've given me.

19:04.004 --> 19:05.596
Congratulations.

19:05.706 --> 19:09.107
They hate you like poison,
and so do I.

19:09.210 --> 19:12.111
Why did I let you
talk me into...

19:12.213 --> 19:13.271
Oscar Beasley,

19:13.381 --> 19:15.281
special assistant
to the administrator.

19:15.383 --> 19:18.284
Could you be in my office
tomorrow afternoon?

19:18.386 --> 19:21.048
Well, uh...
uh, sure.

19:21.155 --> 19:22.713
Good. See you there.

19:22.823 --> 19:23.881
Mr. Beasley.

19:25.192 --> 19:26.591
They loved it.

19:26.694 --> 19:30.095
Would they want to see us again
if they didn't?

19:30.197 --> 19:32.597
You're talking logic.
This is Washington.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.190
Why see us again?

19:34.301 --> 19:35.393
Politics!

19:35.503 --> 19:38.939
We're being set up for
something, believe me.

19:39.039 --> 19:40.973
We got no chance.

19:45.813 --> 19:47.713
How could we
kid ourselves

19:47.815 --> 19:50.716
into thinking anyone
would give us a loan?

19:50.818 --> 19:53.719
All we've got are debts
and more debts.

19:53.821 --> 19:57.154
How does he do it,
the genius you married?

19:57.258 --> 19:59.624
No matter
how much he makes,

19:59.727 --> 20:01.627
he spends twice as much.

20:07.835 --> 20:09.029
Hello?

20:09.136 --> 20:11.229
Where the hell
were you?

20:11.338 --> 20:12.737
How did it go?

20:12.840 --> 20:15.240
They were eating
out of my hand.

20:15.342 --> 20:17.242
I could've
asked for California

20:17.344 --> 20:19.073
and gotten
Arkansas to boot.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.239
Darling, I'm so sorry.

20:21.348 --> 20:22.747
It's not dead yet.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.715
Completely.
Got another meeting tomorrow.

20:24.819 --> 20:26.218
What does Abe think?

20:26.320 --> 20:27.719
What does he know?

20:27.822 --> 20:29.722
Did you get the loan?

20:29.824 --> 20:31.086
They'll think it over.

20:31.192 --> 20:34.093
You're a worse liar
than I am.

20:35.329 --> 20:38.856
Can you please
come home soon, Preston?

20:38.966 --> 20:40.024
Please?

20:40.134 --> 20:41.692
I will, doll.

20:42.803 --> 20:44.202
I love you.

20:44.305 --> 20:45.704
I love you, too.

20:45.806 --> 20:47.706
I'll see you soon,
sweetheart.

20:47.808 --> 20:49.275
Bye.

21:13.667 --> 21:14.725
Mr. Tucker,

21:14.835 --> 21:17.235
in brief,
the committee has voted

21:17.338 --> 21:20.307
to give you the plant
in Chicago,

21:20.407 --> 21:22.807
provided that you
have certified assets

21:22.910 --> 21:25.572
of no less
than $ 15 million.

21:25.679 --> 21:28.580
And to qualify as a legal
manufacturing company,

21:28.682 --> 21:32.083
you'll be required
to produce at least 50 cars

21:32.186 --> 21:34.279
one year after
taking possession.

21:34.388 --> 21:36.015
Is that satisfactory?

21:37.992 --> 21:40.017
W-well I, uh...

21:40.127 --> 21:41.992
sure, I mean, uh...

21:42.096 --> 21:43.154
fine.

21:43.264 --> 21:46.290
Papers will be
ready for signature

21:46.400 --> 21:47.799
5:00 tomorrow afternoon.

21:48.903 --> 21:50.200
Thank you.

21:50.304 --> 21:53.239
Abe, why don't we
let Mr. Beasley

21:53.340 --> 21:54.739
get back to work?

22:05.252 --> 22:07.015
- Yippee!
- Hyah!

22:08.122 --> 22:09.020
Klondike 436.

22:09.123 --> 22:11.023
Go ahead.
I'll hold on.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.023
Preston Tucker.

22:12.126 --> 22:14.026
United Auto Workers
told Roosevelt

22:14.128 --> 22:16.528
if he wants
the labor vote,

22:16.630 --> 22:20.031
he's got to give the plant
to a car company.

22:20.134 --> 22:22.034
Why not Ford,
General Motors?

22:22.136 --> 22:23.535
They don't want it.

22:23.637 --> 22:26.538
How can nobody want
a plant like that?

22:26.640 --> 22:29.541
Everybody wants it,
but you're the only lunatic

22:29.643 --> 22:31.543
dumb enough
to make cars there.

22:31.645 --> 22:33.044
Yeah, he's right here.

22:33.147 --> 22:34.978
Hold that tiger

22:35.082 --> 22:36.879
Hold that tiger

22:36.984 --> 22:38.508
Hold that tiger

22:38.619 --> 22:40.450
Hold that tiger

22:40.554 --> 22:41.486
Hold on.

22:41.589 --> 22:44.956
When can you get the car
to New York?

22:45.059 --> 22:48.460
I got the best press agent
in the business.

22:48.562 --> 22:50.962
To kick off
the stock sale,

22:51.065 --> 22:54.466
he wants to unveil the car
with enough razzmatazz

22:54.568 --> 22:57.628
to make investors beg
to buy those shares.

22:57.738 --> 22:59.137
You hear that?

22:59.239 --> 23:00.570
You bet I did!

23:00.674 --> 23:02.073
We got it!

23:02.176 --> 23:05.077
The biggest damn plant
in the world!

23:05.179 --> 23:06.510
Oh, that's wonderful!

23:06.614 --> 23:10.106
All we need now
is $ 15 million and a car.

23:10.217 --> 23:11.275
That's it.

23:12.553 --> 23:13.952
You love me?

23:14.054 --> 23:15.453
I love ya!

23:15.556 --> 23:16.488
See you.

23:16.590 --> 23:17.522
All right.

23:18.626 --> 23:20.025
We need a car?

23:20.127 --> 23:22.027
Let's celebrate.
Have a drink.

23:22.129 --> 23:24.029
Do we have a car?

23:24.131 --> 23:27.032
Well, no, it's
not a matter of...

23:27.134 --> 23:29.034
Frank, I'll
call you back.

23:30.904 --> 23:32.303
You all right, Abe?

23:32.406 --> 23:33.464
Huh?

23:35.009 --> 23:37.944
Anything else
you want to tell me?

23:38.045 --> 23:42.004
I don't have a dime
to build it with, uh...

23:43.350 --> 23:45.477
You all right? Huh?

23:45.719 --> 23:46.481
Oh!

23:46.587 --> 23:49.454
$50,000 for one car?

23:49.556 --> 23:52.457
It's a prototype.
Hand-built, don't forget.

23:52.559 --> 23:55.528
How much you need
to get started?

23:55.629 --> 23:57.028
Forget the $50,000.

23:57.131 --> 23:59.292
To get started?

23:59.400 --> 24:00.958
At least 10.

24:02.269 --> 24:03.668
I'll give you 6.

24:03.771 --> 24:06.239
If it turns out
you're right,

24:06.340 --> 24:09.275
we could sell dealerships now,
which sounds crazy.

24:09.376 --> 24:12.436
Why would anybody
pay money for a car

24:12.546 --> 24:15.037
that isn't even
in existence yet?

24:19.086 --> 24:22.613
I'm sitting here writing
a check in my handwriting

24:22.723 --> 24:24.122
calling them crazy?

24:30.431 --> 24:32.160
One thing...

24:32.266 --> 24:35.827
we need it absolutely
in 60 days.

24:37.104 --> 24:39.664
Absolutely.
Any problem?

24:39.773 --> 24:41.172
Problems?

24:41.275 --> 24:42.401
It's impossible.

24:42.509 --> 24:43.806
60 days?

24:43.911 --> 24:44.809
Or never.

24:44.912 --> 24:45.844
Why?

24:45.946 --> 24:47.846
We haven't sold enough stock
to buy a dead herring.

24:47.948 --> 24:50.348
But the letters,
all the excitement...

24:50.451 --> 24:53.545
Some people buy cars.
Some people buy stock.

24:53.654 --> 24:56.088
No major investor
will consider us.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.418
But why 60 days?

24:57.524 --> 24:59.924
Because in 60 days...
June 1 st...

25:00.027 --> 25:02.359
we take possession
of the plant.

25:02.463 --> 25:04.363
And not
until that day,

25:04.465 --> 25:06.092
will the mystery car,

25:06.200 --> 25:09.101
the car of the century,
be unveiled.

25:09.203 --> 25:11.034
Uh, Uncle Abe.

25:11.138 --> 25:12.162
Yeah.

25:12.272 --> 25:15.435
I wondered why you do that
with your nose?

25:15.542 --> 25:17.339
What with my nose?

25:17.444 --> 25:19.344
Move it
like a rabbit.

25:19.446 --> 25:20.845
OK, everybody upstairs.

25:20.948 --> 25:22.381
Oh, murder.

25:22.483 --> 25:23.882
Students
to the grindstone.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.218
Bye.

25:27.321 --> 25:28.219
Goodbye.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.089
Do I do that?

25:31.191 --> 25:34.285
You don't do that
with your nose.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.901
Mr. Tucker, sir,
it takes Ford nine months

25:43.003 --> 25:44.903
to go from model
to prototype.

25:45.005 --> 25:47.906
Call every pitman
we know in Indy.

25:48.008 --> 25:49.407
Carrigan, Milton,
maybe Tully.

25:49.510 --> 25:52.138
All right.
Have them here by tomorrow.

25:52.246 --> 25:55.147
Buy clay.
We got to start on that model.

25:55.249 --> 25:58.150
What about steel?
Enough left from the turrets?

25:58.252 --> 25:59.310
Just about.

25:59.419 --> 26:02.013
There are 24 hours
in every day.

26:02.122 --> 26:04.522
Is there anybody
in this room

26:04.625 --> 26:07.287
who can tell me
we can't do it?

26:07.394 --> 26:09.089
We can't do it!

26:09.196 --> 26:11.323
Except you.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.499
Better get with it.

26:14.601 --> 26:16.000
We can't do it!

26:16.103 --> 26:18.196
We can't do it!

26:18.305 --> 26:20.432
Um, Dad, I've,
uh... thought...

26:20.541 --> 26:21.872
Mr. Tucker?

26:22.976 --> 26:24.375
Excuse me, son.

26:24.478 --> 26:25.376
About college.

26:30.417 --> 26:31.611
Hmm.

26:35.489 --> 26:38.390
Dad, I've been
trying to talk to you,

26:38.492 --> 26:41.893
and each time I try
and bring it up...

26:41.995 --> 26:43.053
Look.

26:44.231 --> 26:45.129
What's this?

26:45.232 --> 26:47.632
It's the answer
from Notre Dame.

26:47.734 --> 26:49.133
I got accepted.

26:50.237 --> 26:51.135
But look...

26:51.238 --> 26:52.637
Hey! Congratulations!

26:52.739 --> 26:54.206
I don't want to go!

26:54.308 --> 26:56.776
Look,
l... I want to learn

26:56.877 --> 26:58.777
everything
about cars from you.

26:58.879 --> 27:01.677
I don't want to become president
or something.

27:01.782 --> 27:04.182
Who wants you
to become president?

27:04.284 --> 27:05.649
I thought you did.

27:05.752 --> 27:08.653
The two crummiest things
a person can be

27:08.755 --> 27:10.154
are lawyers
or politicians.

27:10.257 --> 27:13.158
Why would I want you
to be president?

27:13.260 --> 27:15.160
Most of them
are both.

27:15.262 --> 27:16.559
So it's OK.

27:16.663 --> 27:19.962
Sure. You can stay with me.

27:20.067 --> 27:22.467
I'm going to
depend on you.

27:24.571 --> 27:26.038
They won't sell clay.

27:26.139 --> 27:28.039
Can't build models
without it.

27:28.141 --> 27:30.541
Can't build prototypes
without a model.

27:30.644 --> 27:33.545
Take it easy, kid.
Life's full of surprises.

27:34.948 --> 27:35.846
Doug!

27:37.217 --> 27:38.184
Chris!

27:39.820 --> 27:42.220
Want you
to meet Alex,

27:42.322 --> 27:43.653
Head of the Design Department.

27:43.757 --> 27:46.658
These are the best bodyknockers
in the business.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.695
They'll go from your sketch
straight to metal.

27:49.796 --> 27:51.696
How's this
for a frame?

27:51.798 --> 27:53.698
It's OK for a start.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.199
Face this now, Prez.

27:55.302 --> 27:57.202
You got
engine problems.

27:57.304 --> 28:02.003
I should talk you out of
building one from scratch.

28:02.109 --> 28:05.010
You couldn't,
once he's made his mind up.

28:05.112 --> 28:07.012
The rear engine's
the heart.

28:07.114 --> 28:09.514
Just work
the damn thing out.

28:09.616 --> 28:11.516
You can do it, Eddie.

28:13.353 --> 28:15.287
You can do it, Eddie.

28:15.389 --> 28:18.290
I'm offering you the opportunity
of a lifetime...

28:18.392 --> 28:19.791
a new car
dealership.

28:19.893 --> 28:21.292
The most
revolutionary car

28:21.395 --> 28:22.794
in automotive
history.

28:22.896 --> 28:23.794
Sir?

28:23.897 --> 28:25.797
I'll be right with you.

28:25.899 --> 28:27.264
It's got safety features,

28:27.367 --> 28:29.267
torque converters
on every wheel...

28:29.369 --> 28:31.496
double torque converters
won't work.

28:31.605 --> 28:33.072
We need a transmission.

28:33.173 --> 28:35.073
Why the hell
won't they?

28:35.175 --> 28:38.110
We don't have time
to work it out.

28:38.211 --> 28:40.475
You remember the cord 18
transaxle?

28:40.580 --> 28:43.481
That's the only transmission
I can think of.

28:43.583 --> 28:45.983
Yeah, if you
could find one.

28:46.086 --> 28:47.986
What choice do I have?

28:48.088 --> 28:49.487
But only for now.

28:49.589 --> 28:51.750
The minute
we finish that show,

28:51.858 --> 28:54.258
we'll build the car
we advertised.

28:55.996 --> 28:57.759
$ 7,500.

28:57.864 --> 29:01.197
I never thought
I'd live to see the day.

29:06.840 --> 29:10.241
I didn't make the fenders move
with the wheels

29:10.344 --> 29:12.244
like you
wanted to, sir.

29:15.282 --> 29:17.011
Why the hell not?

29:17.117 --> 29:18.209
Hmm?

29:18.318 --> 29:21.481
Remember Frank Lockhard
when he drove the Stutz?

29:21.588 --> 29:24.614
At high speeds
they acted like rudders.

29:24.725 --> 29:26.124
It was very dangerous.

29:26.226 --> 29:28.626
So I made
the middle light

29:28.729 --> 29:30.128
turn with the wheels,

29:30.230 --> 29:31.629
and it works fine.

29:31.732 --> 29:33.131
And it's safe.

29:34.601 --> 29:38.002
You ever do something
I told you not to,

29:38.105 --> 29:39.572
so help me...

29:39.673 --> 29:41.573
I'll give you a raise.

29:43.076 --> 29:43.974
Hey!

29:45.712 --> 29:46.838
No reverse!

29:47.948 --> 29:49.347
Can we fix it?

29:49.449 --> 29:50.848
Not by Monday.

29:50.951 --> 29:52.350
You'll get it.

29:52.452 --> 29:54.750
Junior,
give me a hand here.

29:54.855 --> 29:56.755
All right,
we'll get it.

29:58.825 --> 29:59.883
Push!

30:04.865 --> 30:07.527
Abe, I still don't
like this idea.

30:07.634 --> 30:09.534
We've got to do it, Tucker.

30:09.636 --> 30:11.035
We need
Detroit experience,

30:11.138 --> 30:13.538
or we won't
sell any stock.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.541
As long as he doesn't
try to run the company.

30:17.744 --> 30:19.644
Mr. Tucker.

30:19.746 --> 30:21.646
I've always
admired innovative men

30:21.748 --> 30:24.148
who are willing
to take risks.

30:24.251 --> 30:28.153
I myself introduced nylon seat covers
in our new line.

30:28.255 --> 30:30.246
Ah...

30:30.357 --> 30:33.758
So, when do I get to see
the car?

30:33.860 --> 30:35.794
Soon, Mr. Bennington.

30:35.896 --> 30:38.296
The car has to be shown

30:38.398 --> 30:41.299
in less than a week,
doesn't it?

30:57.384 --> 30:59.284
The piston load
during compression

30:59.386 --> 31:01.718
is three times
normal family cars.

31:01.822 --> 31:04.723
It needs a 24-volt
battery to start,

31:04.825 --> 31:06.224
which don't exist.

31:06.326 --> 31:08.726
How many volts in those? Six.

31:08.829 --> 31:11.229
Use two truck batteries.
They're 12.

31:11.331 --> 31:12.730
That's 24.

31:13.934 --> 31:15.333
What do you think

31:15.435 --> 31:17.630
of these pictures
in these brochures?

31:17.737 --> 31:19.898
I want to talk
about that.

31:20.006 --> 31:21.405
That board
of directors

31:21.508 --> 31:22.941
they stuck me with...

31:23.043 --> 31:25.944
I don't know if Bennington's
an undertaker

31:26.046 --> 31:28.708
or one of the stiffs
he embalmed.

31:28.815 --> 31:30.214
Preston.

31:30.317 --> 31:32.308
How many years
of testing?

31:32.419 --> 31:33.317
15?

31:33.420 --> 31:35.820
I've been thinking
about that car

31:35.922 --> 31:37.287
longer than 15 years.

31:37.390 --> 31:38.948
Thinking's
not exactly testing.

31:39.059 --> 31:39.957
It's advertising.

31:40.060 --> 31:42.460
You're not supposed
to believe it.

31:42.562 --> 31:43.961
If you're selling candy,

31:44.064 --> 31:46.589
what do you advertise,
rotting teeth?

31:52.372 --> 31:53.430
Uh.

31:53.540 --> 31:55.531
You caught me,
didn't you?

31:55.642 --> 31:59.043
Uh-huh. Don't you give me
that crooked little smile

31:59.146 --> 32:00.977
you stole
from Clark Gable.

32:01.081 --> 32:03.982
What? I didn't steal that
from Clark Gable!

32:04.084 --> 32:05.483
I've caught you
practicing.

32:05.585 --> 32:07.610
You thought
I wasn't looking.

32:08.822 --> 32:12.314
Oh, now,
this smile here. See?

32:12.425 --> 32:14.359
This is my downfall.

32:14.461 --> 32:15.860
The real you.

32:15.962 --> 32:18.396
The canary
who ate the cat.

32:24.838 --> 32:27.238
That smile
made you do that?

32:27.340 --> 32:28.637
Every time.

32:31.845 --> 32:35.076
You know what this smile
makes me want to do?

32:35.182 --> 32:36.649
Punch you.

32:41.855 --> 32:43.755
Let's stick
with the canary.

32:57.871 --> 33:00.203
Mr. Bennington,
members of the board,

33:00.307 --> 33:02.639
we have one
major problem.

33:02.742 --> 33:04.266
Yes, Mr. Tucker?

33:04.377 --> 33:08.609
Just what sort
of problem is that?

33:08.715 --> 33:10.774
Well...

33:10.884 --> 33:12.784
they're putting
the squeeze on.

33:12.886 --> 33:13.784
Detroit.

33:13.887 --> 33:16.788
We can't buy clay.
We can't buy steel.

33:16.890 --> 33:18.289
We can't buy anything.

33:18.391 --> 33:19.790
That doesn't
surprise me.

33:19.893 --> 33:22.293
So I'm meeting
with Senator Ferguson.

33:22.395 --> 33:25.296
We'll straighten this thing out
eyeball to eyeball.

33:25.398 --> 33:26.296
Wait.

33:26.399 --> 33:27.366
You wait.

33:27.467 --> 33:29.867
We'll nip this
in the bud.

33:29.970 --> 33:32.871
You think a smile
will make him forget

33:32.973 --> 33:34.873
he's a senator
from Detroit?

33:34.975 --> 33:37.910
We're making cars
in Chicago.

33:38.011 --> 33:40.536
He's my senator, too,
don't forget.

33:50.857 --> 33:53.257
The senator
will see you now.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.622
Very good.

33:58.598 --> 33:59.496
This way?

33:59.599 --> 34:01.032
Right through
that door.

34:03.236 --> 34:04.134
Senator.

34:05.972 --> 34:07.997
Preston Tucker.

34:08.108 --> 34:09.632
Mr. Tucker.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.643
A.H. Karatz.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.975
K-A-R-A-T-Z, huh?

34:14.080 --> 34:14.978
Huh?

34:15.081 --> 34:17.139
Sit down, gentlemen.
Sit down.

34:18.418 --> 34:20.318
Let's get
to the point.

34:20.420 --> 34:23.321
I know you're a powerful man
in Washington.

34:23.422 --> 34:24.321
Oh.

34:24.424 --> 34:27.324
I also know that
your main job is...

34:27.427 --> 34:30.692
Limo's here, Senator.

34:30.797 --> 34:32.196
Well, I'm sorry,
gentlemen.

34:32.299 --> 34:34.199
It was just
getting interesting.

34:34.301 --> 34:38.203
My plans changed on me
since we made this appointment,

34:38.304 --> 34:40.705
as they do
every two seconds.

34:40.806 --> 34:43.206
I'm not going to
be able to... Alice?

34:43.310 --> 34:45.210
Did you take care of...

34:45.312 --> 34:47.371
First thing
in the morning.

34:47.480 --> 34:50.005
Huh? Walk me to the car?

34:54.487 --> 34:55.418
Good day.

34:55.522 --> 34:58.150
Senator, don't forget
the 4:00 meeting.

34:58.258 --> 34:59.156
Got it.

34:59.259 --> 35:00.157
Senator?

35:00.260 --> 35:03.127
Just bring everything
to the plane.

35:06.299 --> 35:09.132
You, uh...
you like Jack Benny?

35:09.235 --> 35:10.133
Senator!

35:10.236 --> 35:11.635
He's my favorite.

35:11.738 --> 35:12.636
Tickets.

35:12.739 --> 35:14.138
Oh, thank you.

35:14.240 --> 35:18.006
"Problems are just opportunities
in work clothes."

35:18.111 --> 35:22.104
That's a quote from my friend
Henry J. Kaiser.

35:22.215 --> 35:23.113
Karatz.

35:23.216 --> 35:24.581
Afternoon, Senator.

35:24.684 --> 35:27.084
Get that thing
we talked about?

35:27.187 --> 35:28.586
Got a phone call.

35:28.688 --> 35:32.419
Call Tim.
Tell him I told you, huh?

35:32.525 --> 35:33.583
In Washington,

35:33.693 --> 35:36.423
did you meet Harry Macdonald,
head of S.E.C.?

35:36.529 --> 35:37.427
Not yet.

35:37.530 --> 35:40.055
Local boy,
good man, loyal.

35:40.166 --> 35:42.566
Who's your favorite
comedian, Mr. Tucker?

35:42.669 --> 35:45.069
That's how
you keep that figure.

35:45.171 --> 35:46.570
That's one way,
Senator.

35:50.777 --> 35:52.642
Quite an idea
of yours...

35:52.746 --> 35:55.977
selling dealerships for cars
that don't exist.

36:00.253 --> 36:01.584
You remember
that song?

36:01.688 --> 36:03.417
Music goes
round and round

36:03.523 --> 36:04.820
Oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh

36:04.924 --> 36:06.789
And it
comes out here

36:09.662 --> 36:13.063
The Big Three should be indicted
for manslaughter, huh?

36:14.768 --> 36:15.962
Funny line.

36:24.544 --> 36:27.172
What was that all about?

36:27.280 --> 36:30.272
Did he say anything?
What did he say?

36:30.383 --> 36:33.284
He said stay out
of the car business,

36:33.386 --> 36:35.786
or we cut
your nuggies off.

36:40.660 --> 36:42.059
All right.
Now what?

36:42.162 --> 36:44.392
I can't give you
a fuel injection.

36:44.497 --> 36:45.896
No fuel injection?

36:45.999 --> 36:48.399
You want the car
on time,

36:48.501 --> 36:51.402
the only hope we got
is twin carburetors.

36:52.672 --> 36:53.570
Oh!

36:55.008 --> 36:56.407
God damn it!

36:57.844 --> 36:59.744
Where is my car?

37:02.782 --> 37:04.682
What's left of it,
anything?

37:15.295 --> 37:16.523
Hi, Abe.

37:16.629 --> 37:18.187
Vera, how are you?

37:18.298 --> 37:19.697
Great. Come on in.

37:19.799 --> 37:21.528
Uncle Abe! Uncle Abe!

37:21.634 --> 37:22.692
Wha...

37:22.802 --> 37:24.201
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:24.304 --> 37:25.202
My goodness.

37:25.305 --> 37:28.206
Whoa, look what I have for you.

37:28.308 --> 37:29.707
It's from Chicago.

37:29.809 --> 37:30.707
For me?

37:30.810 --> 37:32.710
I hope you like it.

37:36.316 --> 37:38.716
Oh, I love it, Uncle Abe.

37:38.818 --> 37:40.046
Is it all right?

37:40.153 --> 37:42.713
What do I know
about ladies' dresses?

37:42.822 --> 37:44.722
Can I try it on?

37:47.327 --> 37:48.726
Well, well, well.

37:48.828 --> 37:49.726
Oh!

37:49.829 --> 37:50.727
Oh!

37:50.830 --> 37:52.229
You got me.

37:52.332 --> 37:54.732
Here's a present
for you, Noble.

37:54.834 --> 37:56.233
Something for you.

38:04.611 --> 38:06.010
Well, tell me gently.

38:06.112 --> 38:08.012
Do we have a car?

38:10.049 --> 38:10.947
Well...

38:11.050 --> 38:12.517
we've got something.

38:14.687 --> 38:18.088
Does it look like
the car in the ads?

38:18.191 --> 38:20.682
Looks like it.

38:20.793 --> 38:22.693
So why are
you worried?

38:22.795 --> 38:25.696
All they have to do
is see it.

38:25.798 --> 38:27.197
Here's
your martini, Abe.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.699
A drink. Come.

38:35.808 --> 38:37.207
To the car.

38:37.310 --> 38:39.710
- To the car.
- To the car.

38:45.318 --> 38:46.546
Whoo.

38:46.653 --> 38:48.712
Don't you
just love it?

38:48.821 --> 38:50.220
Thank you,
Uncle Abe.

38:50.323 --> 38:51.221
You're welcome.

38:51.324 --> 38:53.724
Thanks.
Don't you just love it?

38:53.826 --> 38:55.726
It's beautiful,
sweetie.

38:55.828 --> 38:56.726
Dad!

38:56.829 --> 38:57.887
Where's dad?

38:57.997 --> 38:59.897
You better
get out there.

38:59.999 --> 39:02.832
Oil's leaking from
the rear main seal.

39:02.936 --> 39:05.336
We just blew
a head gasket.

39:05.438 --> 39:07.406
The whole thing's
falling apart.

39:07.507 --> 39:10.408
What's going on?
I leave for one minute.

39:10.510 --> 39:11.499
Where's Eddie?

39:11.611 --> 39:12.669
Eddie!

39:14.380 --> 39:15.779
What is it?

39:15.882 --> 39:17.941
It's just what
we expected.

39:20.286 --> 39:22.186
What the hell
was that?

39:23.623 --> 39:25.022
Hey, are you OK?

39:25.124 --> 39:26.523
Are you all right?

39:26.626 --> 39:27.684
You're OK?

39:27.794 --> 39:29.193
We could've
gotten killed.

39:29.295 --> 39:30.694
Totalled the suspension.

39:30.797 --> 39:32.697
You're all right.
All right.

39:32.799 --> 39:35.700
With all that weight.
Dutch. Where's Dutch?

39:35.802 --> 39:37.702
We need
four new arms

39:37.804 --> 39:39.203
machined
from solid stock.

39:39.305 --> 39:40.203
No sweat.

39:42.308 --> 39:44.708
What the hell's
happening to you?

39:44.811 --> 39:47.712
That kid nearly got
his brains splattered.

39:47.814 --> 39:49.577
You don't even notice.

39:49.682 --> 39:52.082
For what?
That pile of junk?

39:52.185 --> 39:55.211
That's all it is...
a pile of junk.

39:55.321 --> 39:57.221
Aah!

40:07.834 --> 40:10.234
Listen to me.
You listening? Carefully?

40:10.336 --> 40:12.236
We're going to
build that car,

40:12.338 --> 40:14.238
the one we
dreamed of,

40:14.340 --> 40:16.740
exactly the way
we want it.

40:25.852 --> 40:28.753
Feeling better?
That's what I came down for...

40:28.855 --> 40:30.254
to cheer you up.

40:30.356 --> 40:31.254
I'm fine.

40:31.357 --> 40:32.255
Cheerful?

40:32.358 --> 40:33.757
I'm plenty cheerful.

40:33.860 --> 40:35.088
Too cheerful.

40:38.865 --> 40:40.264
You think
that's cheerful...

40:40.366 --> 40:42.266
watching me
lose my mind?

40:42.368 --> 40:44.268
Know what's
even more cheerful?

40:44.370 --> 40:45.769
Having ringside seats

40:45.872 --> 40:47.271
at your own
crucifixion,

40:47.373 --> 40:49.773
which I might
have in Chicago.

41:07.827 --> 41:09.226
How's it going?

41:09.328 --> 41:12.229
This is Frank
the press agent.

41:12.331 --> 41:15.732
Abe. He thinks
"Frank the press agent" is one word.

41:15.835 --> 41:18.235
Frank. Please.

41:18.337 --> 41:20.237
These are the security guards?

41:20.339 --> 41:22.239
Three shifts
round the clock.

41:22.341 --> 41:24.741
Absolutely nobody
gets near this car.

41:24.844 --> 41:26.243
I told them.

41:27.346 --> 41:28.574
Ooh! Frank.

41:29.849 --> 41:31.248
Naughty, naughty.

41:33.453 --> 41:36.581
No, no. Down, down.
Now, move that.

41:36.689 --> 41:38.088
This is Stan.

41:38.191 --> 41:41.092
He's making a promotional
film about you.

41:41.194 --> 41:42.593
Nice to meet you.

41:42.695 --> 41:45.596
It's a puff kind
of a promo film...

41:45.698 --> 41:48.098
Sales meetings, dealerships,
things like that.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.601
If you have
any family albums,

41:50.703 --> 41:51.601
uh, snapshots...

41:51.704 --> 41:52.602
Home movies?

41:52.705 --> 41:54.104
You just shut up.

41:54.207 --> 41:57.199
Home movies,
anything like that we could use.

41:57.310 --> 41:58.709
What's the point?

41:58.811 --> 41:59.709
Selling stock.

41:59.812 --> 42:01.473
Selling stock
in my family?

42:01.581 --> 42:04.482
We're not just selling cars.
We're selling you...

42:04.584 --> 42:05.881
which includes your family.

42:05.985 --> 42:09.113
That newsreel of you
in the White House?

42:09.222 --> 42:11.122
You think
the President's yelling,

42:11.224 --> 42:12.122
"Get me Tucker!"?

42:12.225 --> 42:14.625
You can't buy
publicity like that.

42:14.727 --> 42:16.285
You did.

42:16.395 --> 42:17.794
Yeah. For money.

42:17.897 --> 42:19.125
Sure.

42:19.232 --> 42:21.132
Nothing you say
makes sense.

42:21.234 --> 42:23.964
How come I always
know what you mean?

42:24.070 --> 42:27.301
Because you talk worse than me
the same language.

42:27.406 --> 42:28.395
Mr. Tucker.

42:28.508 --> 42:31.375
Some shots looking up
at the sign.

42:31.477 --> 42:32.466
Dignified,

42:32.578 --> 42:33.636
serious,

42:33.746 --> 42:34.804
confident...

42:34.914 --> 42:36.973
a regular captain
of industry.

42:42.421 --> 42:45.822
Broadcasting live
from the Tucker auto plant.

42:45.925 --> 42:49.326
The largest parking lot in
the world, completely filled.

42:49.428 --> 42:51.760
People coming here
from everywhere...

42:51.864 --> 42:54.332
Washington, D.C.,
New York.

42:54.433 --> 42:56.333
They're here
with their families,

42:56.435 --> 42:57.834
all looking very excited

42:57.937 --> 42:59.336
about seeing
the innovations

42:59.438 --> 43:01.269
they've heard
so much about

43:01.374 --> 43:02.773
in the Tucker
automobile.

43:02.875 --> 43:04.274
300 people were invited,

43:04.377 --> 43:06.641
and over 1,000
have shown up.

43:18.891 --> 43:21.792
Since 13,
when he was office boy

43:21.894 --> 43:24.294
for the Vice President
of Cadillac,

43:24.397 --> 43:25.796
Preston Tucker's
been identified...

43:25.898 --> 43:27.627
Noble, you sit here.

43:27.733 --> 43:30.793
What did you
get me into?

43:30.903 --> 43:33.303
The biggest day
in automotive history.

43:33.406 --> 43:34.805
I didn't expect this.

43:34.907 --> 43:37.398
Wait and see.
Wait and see.

43:38.911 --> 43:40.310
OK, push it.

43:40.413 --> 43:41.812
Aahh...

43:41.914 --> 43:44.815
How much longer?
We're an hour late already.

43:44.917 --> 43:46.817
The damn wheels
are locked.

43:46.919 --> 43:47.817
Ohh!

43:47.920 --> 43:50.320
Come on.
Let's try rocking it.

43:50.423 --> 43:51.822
Come on, Jimmy.

43:53.759 --> 43:56.626
OK. Try the other way.
Rock it, now.

43:57.930 --> 43:59.329
Come on. Rock it.

43:59.432 --> 44:02.265
Nah, Junior, you got
to go underneath.

44:02.368 --> 44:03.699
Eddie,
get that socket.

44:03.803 --> 44:04.861
Eddie!

44:04.971 --> 44:07.769
Having a little trouble
back there, seems like.

44:07.874 --> 44:10.274
Been up all night,
poor bastards,

44:10.376 --> 44:13.277
trying to hold that pile
of junk together.

44:13.379 --> 44:16.280
It won't even back up.
No kidding.

44:16.382 --> 44:17.280
No reverse.

44:17.383 --> 44:19.783
Jack it up!
Get in there.

44:19.886 --> 44:22.446
Would you like
to help me out?

44:22.555 --> 44:24.853
Let me know
what goes on.

44:24.957 --> 44:26.288
We want the car!

44:26.392 --> 44:28.451
We want the car!

44:28.561 --> 44:30.426
Let's go!
Come on!

44:30.529 --> 44:31.928
What's going on?

44:32.031 --> 44:33.965
Who knows?
The board's getting impatient.

44:38.905 --> 44:40.304
Senator Ferguson.

44:41.607 --> 44:44.007
Preston, get this thing
started now!

44:44.110 --> 44:46.305
Do something. Stall.
Anything.

44:46.412 --> 44:48.312
Bennington
is going crazy.

44:48.414 --> 44:50.882
Signal when ready
from that corner.

44:50.983 --> 44:52.177
That corner?

44:52.285 --> 44:53.183
Yeah.

44:53.286 --> 44:54.651
Take out some weight!

45:02.795 --> 45:05.764
Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

45:05.865 --> 45:07.264
I'm Preston Tucker.

45:07.366 --> 45:08.765
Sorry for the delay.

45:08.868 --> 45:11.996
Perhaps this will perk
you up... the Tuckerettes!

45:12.104 --> 45:13.765
What are
Tuckerettes?

45:13.873 --> 45:15.101
They're girls.

45:15.207 --> 45:16.174
Girls!

45:20.913 --> 45:23.279
The back tires can't move

45:23.382 --> 45:26.351
with all that weight
on the rear wheels.

45:27.887 --> 45:29.946
Try this
for a brace.

45:35.528 --> 45:38.497
Let's hear it
for the Tuckerettes!

45:40.166 --> 45:43.533
OK, Junior. Tell your dad.
Let's go.

45:43.636 --> 45:44.534
We're set!

45:44.637 --> 45:45.968
Aren't they
lovely creatures?

45:46.072 --> 45:47.039
Dad!

45:48.841 --> 45:49.967
Back here!

45:50.076 --> 45:51.236
Back here!

45:51.344 --> 45:53.744
Dad, we got it.
We're set.

45:53.846 --> 45:54.778
And now,

45:54.880 --> 45:56.814
ladies and gentlemen,

45:56.916 --> 45:59.817
the history-making moment
you've all been waiting for.

46:01.387 --> 46:03.787
OK, come on,
let's push, guys.

46:03.889 --> 46:05.117
Hold it, Eddie!

46:05.224 --> 46:07.249
We got a leak again.

46:07.360 --> 46:10.261
Tell your dad
to hold it. Hold it.

46:10.363 --> 46:12.263
Dad! Dad!
Dad, hold it!

46:12.365 --> 46:14.060
Hold it. Stop.

46:17.203 --> 46:19.103
But first, you don't mind

46:19.205 --> 46:21.833
if I introduce
my family, do you?

46:21.941 --> 46:23.533
My lovely wife Vera.

46:26.746 --> 46:29.271
My daughter Marilyn Lee.

46:29.382 --> 46:31.475
Isn't she lovely?

46:31.584 --> 46:34.018
Junior,
get the soldering iron.

46:34.120 --> 46:36.611
My eldest son
is backstage.

46:36.722 --> 46:38.155
Asleep in the car?

46:38.257 --> 46:39.622
Ladies and gentlemen,

46:39.725 --> 46:41.693
the car everyone
calls the Tucker...

46:41.794 --> 46:42.886
let's go.

46:42.995 --> 46:44.121
But first...

46:44.230 --> 46:45.128
Dad!

46:45.231 --> 46:46.596
Dad!

46:46.699 --> 46:47.597
We're set.

46:47.700 --> 46:50.601
Does anybody want
to see the car?

46:52.905 --> 46:53.803
Hold it.

46:53.906 --> 46:55.168
Fire!

46:55.274 --> 46:57.572
Get the fire
extinguishers.

46:59.812 --> 47:02.246
But first...

47:02.348 --> 47:06.614
I'd like to show you
the cars many features.

47:08.888 --> 47:11.550
Ladies, the Detroit-mobile.

47:11.657 --> 47:13.557
You're standing
on my foot.

47:13.659 --> 47:16.150
You're on my foot.

47:16.262 --> 47:18.753
Because of the revolutionary
Tucker rear engine...

47:21.267 --> 47:23.701
Stop. There's no more fire there.

47:23.803 --> 47:25.668
What took you
so long?

47:25.771 --> 47:28.672
Drive your Tucker
to the dumbest mechanic

47:28.774 --> 47:30.173
anywhere in the world,

47:30.276 --> 47:33.177
and he'll be able
to remove the engine

47:33.279 --> 47:35.679
and replace it
within 20 minutes.

47:35.781 --> 47:39.740
Didn't you tell him
we're not doing that?

47:39.852 --> 47:42.844
Let's hear it
for the Tuckerettes.

47:42.955 --> 47:43.853
Come on!

47:43.956 --> 47:45.184
Boo!

47:45.291 --> 47:46.690
We want the car!

47:46.792 --> 47:48.191
We want the car!

47:48.294 --> 47:49.522
Come on, Tucker.

47:49.628 --> 47:52.028
We want the car.

47:52.131 --> 47:54.190
We want the car.

47:54.300 --> 47:56.029
We want the car.

47:56.135 --> 47:57.534
We want the car.

47:57.636 --> 47:59.035
We want the car.

47:59.138 --> 48:00.503
We want the car.

48:00.606 --> 48:03.234
...that dreams
can come true.

48:03.342 --> 48:05.105
Ladies and gentlemen,

48:05.211 --> 48:08.442
don't let a Tucker
pass you by.

48:11.150 --> 48:12.139
Ladies...

48:47.653 --> 48:48.551
Whoa.

48:48.654 --> 48:50.053
That's pretty good.

48:55.661 --> 48:58.391
Get up here.
Come on. Sweetie.

48:58.497 --> 48:59.896
Come on!

49:23.189 --> 49:25.487
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

49:25.591 --> 49:26.888
my love,

49:26.992 --> 49:28.755
my inspiration,

49:28.861 --> 49:30.692
my wife...

49:30.796 --> 49:31.854
Vera.

49:35.167 --> 49:36.361
Yeah! Yeah!

49:45.678 --> 49:48.442
I usually don't take a bath
till Saturday.

50:36.228 --> 50:39.629
We are pleased to say
this newly christened car

50:39.732 --> 50:42.132
gets over
20 miles per gallon,

50:42.234 --> 50:44.794
is capable
of 130 miles per hour,

50:44.903 --> 50:47.463
and hasn't even
been opened up yet.

50:47.573 --> 50:50.474
The car features seat belts,
a rear motor,

50:50.576 --> 50:52.976
and has a sponge-rubber
crash panel.

50:53.078 --> 50:54.477
Buy a Tucker.

50:54.580 --> 50:57.447
Don't let the future
pass you by.

51:00.003 --> 51:03.734
This man Tucker
is a loose cannon.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.239
He just
doesn't understand

51:05.342 --> 51:06.900
how a corporation runs.

51:07.010 --> 51:09.570
He's not much
of an engineer either.

51:09.679 --> 51:11.579
If we don't
watch out,

51:11.681 --> 51:14.582
we'll never build those cars
in time.

51:14.684 --> 51:17.585
Why don't we
let him go off

51:17.687 --> 51:20.087
on a nice long
publicity tour?

51:20.190 --> 51:22.454
Not a bad idea.

51:31.535 --> 51:32.502
All right.

51:55.792 --> 51:59.728
Preston, I'd like you
to meet Mrs. Mellon.

51:59.830 --> 52:01.229
Preston Tucker.

52:13.877 --> 52:15.811
Mr. Preston Tucker,

52:15.912 --> 52:18.312
the key to
our fair city

52:18.415 --> 52:19.814
and this
beautiful plaque

52:19.916 --> 52:21.315
to commemorate
your achievements.

52:51.381 --> 52:52.780
The Tuckers are here.

52:57.787 --> 52:58.811
Sir.

52:58.922 --> 52:59.820
Wow.

52:59.923 --> 53:01.254
This is it...
Chicago.

53:01.358 --> 53:04.259
This has got to be
100 stories high.

53:05.662 --> 53:07.459
This way, ma'am.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.298
Well,

53:11.401 --> 53:13.801
how do you
like it, huh?

53:15.839 --> 53:18.740
I got a real buy
on it.

53:18.842 --> 53:19.740
Hello, Millie.

53:19.843 --> 53:21.242
How are you,
darling?

53:21.344 --> 53:22.538
Hi, Millie.

53:22.646 --> 53:24.045
In here,
the kitchen.

53:24.147 --> 53:25.546
You got
an elevator

53:25.649 --> 53:27.514
goes up
and down.

53:27.617 --> 53:30.950
Strap-work ceilings.
Beautiful.

53:32.522 --> 53:35.082
That's why I got it so cheap,

53:35.191 --> 53:36.590
from a vaudeville
family.

53:36.693 --> 53:38.957
Uh... very wealthy,

53:39.062 --> 53:40.086
but, uh...

53:40.196 --> 53:41.595
midgets.

53:48.238 --> 53:51.139
I want to buy
a steel plant.

53:51.241 --> 53:52.640
We need one.

53:52.742 --> 53:55.302
I'll check with Beasley
at War Assets

53:55.412 --> 53:58.313
and see if we can't
find another plant.

53:58.415 --> 54:00.315
How do you
get one?

54:00.417 --> 54:02.749
They go to
the highest bidder.

54:02.852 --> 54:03.750
May I?

54:05.889 --> 54:08.289
That's a hell
of a lighter.

54:16.466 --> 54:19.367
Here are the new specs
from Mr. Bennington.

54:19.469 --> 54:21.869
64 inches high
instead of 56.

54:21.972 --> 54:23.371
And the wheel track...

54:23.473 --> 54:24.872
Who are you exactly?

54:24.975 --> 54:26.374
I'm from Engineering upstairs.

54:26.476 --> 54:29.377
Take a look
at what we've done.

54:29.479 --> 54:30.878
God damn it!

54:30.981 --> 54:31.879
Damn it!

54:31.982 --> 54:33.381
Hey, what's the matter?

54:33.483 --> 54:36.043
Hey, this is better.

54:36.152 --> 54:39.053
The engine definitely
can't go in the rear.

54:39.155 --> 54:40.986
No rear engine?

54:42.492 --> 54:43.891
No rear engine?

54:43.994 --> 54:46.394
We can't
get it to work.

54:46.496 --> 54:47.758
No rear engine!

54:47.864 --> 54:49.263
We represent
Mr. Tucker.

54:49.366 --> 54:50.765
This is very important.

54:50.867 --> 54:53.267
I'm sorry.
You can't see him.

54:53.370 --> 54:54.769
He went out.

55:00.844 --> 55:02.744
Next time Bennington goes out,

55:02.846 --> 55:05.747
tell him to take
his body with him.

55:14.858 --> 55:16.621
Mrs. Tucker.

55:16.726 --> 55:19.320
Well, well...

55:19.429 --> 55:21.090
what a nice surprise.

55:21.197 --> 55:22.095
I'm, uh...

55:22.198 --> 55:24.598
l-I'm really
delighted to see you.

55:24.701 --> 55:25.929
Uh, but, um...

55:26.036 --> 55:30.405
would you be good enough
to give my wife a call?

55:30.507 --> 55:31.906
Mrs. Bennington
has complete charge

55:32.008 --> 55:33.407
of our social visits.

55:33.510 --> 55:35.910
There's nothing social
about this visit.

55:36.012 --> 55:37.377
Sit down, gentlemen.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.380
We can skip
the minuet.

55:43.887 --> 55:45.411
What is this?

55:46.623 --> 55:47.920
And this?

55:48.024 --> 55:49.150
And this?

55:49.259 --> 55:51.159
And this is ridiculous.

55:51.261 --> 55:52.660
Ha ha ha.

55:52.762 --> 55:54.662
I admire this
very much

55:54.764 --> 55:57.597
when the little woman
takes a keen interest

55:57.701 --> 55:59.601
in her husband's
business affairs.

55:59.703 --> 56:04.470
Why did you change the design
of my husband's car?

56:04.574 --> 56:05.973
And the colors.

56:06.076 --> 56:08.374
Waltz blue
came from the color

56:08.478 --> 56:10.275
of one
of my dresses.

56:10.380 --> 56:11.369
Mrs. Tucker,

56:11.481 --> 56:14.279
your husband's fantasy
of a rear-engine car,

56:14.384 --> 56:16.113
well,

56:16.219 --> 56:18.619
it just doesn't work,
that's all.

56:18.722 --> 56:21.623
There's very little likelihood
it'll ever work.

56:21.725 --> 56:23.556
I'm really sorry
about that.

56:23.660 --> 56:24.957
What about this?

56:25.061 --> 56:27.962
Preston promised his car would sell
for $ 1,000.

56:28.064 --> 56:30.624
In this memo,
you've doubled the price.

56:30.734 --> 56:32.224
Uh...

56:32.335 --> 56:33.734
my wife and I

56:33.837 --> 56:37.739
would like to have you
as our guest for dinner.

56:37.841 --> 56:40.071
I'll buy my own dinner,
Benny.

56:40.176 --> 56:41.438
Answer the question. Why?

56:42.645 --> 56:44.340
Steel.

56:44.447 --> 56:47.348
We just can't get
any of it.

56:47.450 --> 56:51.352
It's costing us twice as much
as the Big Three.

56:51.454 --> 56:52.853
Oh, really, Mrs. Tucker,

56:52.956 --> 56:55.686
I don't mean
to be rude,

56:55.792 --> 56:57.692
but we're
in the middle

56:57.794 --> 56:59.694
of a rather
crucial meeting.

57:09.773 --> 57:12.936
When you're
riding in a Tucker

57:13.042 --> 57:14.134
Doo-doo-do

57:14.244 --> 57:15.871
When you're
riding in a Tucker

57:15.979 --> 57:17.276
Doo-doo-do

57:17.380 --> 57:19.007
When you're
riding in a Tucker

57:19.115 --> 57:20.139
Ooh-ah

57:20.250 --> 57:21.376
The car of tomorrow

57:21.484 --> 57:22.542
The car of tomorrow

57:22.652 --> 57:23.641
The car of tomorrow

57:23.753 --> 57:25.311
Today

57:25.421 --> 57:27.116
The car of tomorrow

57:27.223 --> 57:29.714
Today

57:34.030 --> 57:34.928
Hi, folks.

57:35.031 --> 57:36.430
I'm Preston Tucker.

57:36.533 --> 57:39.434
It's not polite
to blow your own horn...

57:40.537 --> 57:43.938
so I'll let the soundman
do it for me.

57:47.277 --> 57:48.403
But seriously...

57:48.511 --> 57:49.910
who wrote this?

57:50.013 --> 57:52.914
I'll think
of my own stuff to say.

57:53.016 --> 57:54.415
Phone for Mr. Tucker.

57:54.517 --> 57:55.711
I'll call them back.

57:55.819 --> 57:57.047
It's your wife.

57:57.153 --> 57:58.552
She says
it's important.

57:58.655 --> 57:59.587
All right.

57:59.689 --> 58:02.021
We can do better
than this.

58:03.259 --> 58:04.453
Hey, doll.

58:04.561 --> 58:06.461
Get back here
right away.

58:06.563 --> 58:08.554
Dad, Bennington's
changed the designs

58:08.665 --> 58:10.565
to a standard
front-mounted engine.

58:10.667 --> 58:13.227
He's changed the whole body
and everything.

58:13.336 --> 58:15.201
Don't worry.
It's all right.

58:15.305 --> 58:17.432
If Bennington
keeps tooling up

58:17.540 --> 58:20.100
for his 1940 Plymouth
version he's building,

58:20.210 --> 58:22.770
it'll cost millions
for us to retool.

58:22.879 --> 58:24.278
We have to sell stock.

58:24.380 --> 58:27.281
Otherwise,
there won't be a car to ruin.

58:27.383 --> 58:28.611
When I get home,

58:28.718 --> 58:31.380
I'll send him back
to the mortuary.

58:31.487 --> 58:33.955
Bennington says
we'll have to double the price

58:34.057 --> 58:36.617
because we're being
charged double for steel.

58:36.726 --> 58:38.353
Turn that down!

58:38.461 --> 58:41.521
And, Preston,
no waltz blue.

58:41.631 --> 58:42.529
What?

58:42.632 --> 58:43.530
Our color.

58:45.034 --> 58:47.434
Doll, I'm on my way back.

58:47.537 --> 58:48.435
All right.

58:51.541 --> 58:53.441
The rear engine is out.

58:53.543 --> 58:56.444
Your own engineers
admit that 589 engine

58:56.546 --> 58:57.945
is a failure.

58:58.047 --> 59:00.379
The chair recognizes
no further discussion.

59:00.483 --> 59:02.348
Who made him the chair?

59:02.452 --> 59:03.476
Also denied

59:03.586 --> 59:05.884
and eliminated
from any further discussion

59:05.989 --> 59:07.388
are disc brakes,

59:07.490 --> 59:09.856
fuel injection,

59:09.959 --> 59:12.427
hydraulic valve
lifters,

59:12.528 --> 59:13.586
seat belts...

59:13.696 --> 59:14.594
Seat belts?

59:14.697 --> 59:17.598
How can you object
to seat belts?

59:17.700 --> 59:18.928
Our marketing department

59:19.035 --> 59:21.595
says they imply
the cars are unsafe.

59:21.704 --> 59:24.605
If one person is
killed in a Tucker

59:24.707 --> 59:27.608
because of some safety
feature you eliminated...

59:27.710 --> 59:29.109
May I remind you,

59:29.212 --> 59:31.772
you have no voice
in policy matters.

59:31.881 --> 59:34.111
I'm in complete charge
of this company.

59:34.217 --> 59:36.014
What company? My company?

59:36.119 --> 59:37.245
Ha ha ha.

59:37.353 --> 59:40.015
I think you'll find it stated
unequivocally

59:40.123 --> 59:42.421
in my contract.

59:48.731 --> 59:50.255
Is that true?

59:52.635 --> 59:55.536
We needed his name
to sell the stock.

59:56.806 --> 59:59.206
We needed a man
with experience

59:59.309 --> 59:59.976
to run things, but...

59:59.976 --> 01:00:00.635
to run things, but...

01:00:00.743 --> 01:00:03.007
Tucker, I give you my word,

01:00:03.112 --> 01:00:04.443
I swear to God,

01:00:04.547 --> 01:00:07.448
I didn't know that
was in his contract.

01:00:09.519 --> 01:00:11.544
You can't have Falstaff

01:00:11.654 --> 01:00:14.885
and have him thin, Mr. Tucker.

01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:17.653
What does that mean?

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.489
Well...

01:00:19.595 --> 01:00:23.691
little boats should
be kept near the shore.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.200
He talks like
a fortune cookie.

01:00:26.302 --> 01:00:27.701
This is my company.

01:00:27.804 --> 01:00:29.203
That means seat belts,

01:00:29.305 --> 01:00:30.397
disc brakes,

01:00:30.506 --> 01:00:32.974
fuel injection,
and a rear engine.

01:00:33.076 --> 01:00:35.544
We'll see about that,
Mr. Tucker.

01:00:41.384 --> 01:00:41.517
That son of a bitch
isn't getting my company!

01:00:41.517 --> 01:00:45.419
That son of a bitch
isn't getting my company!

01:00:45.521 --> 01:00:46.419
Daddy.

01:00:47.523 --> 01:00:48.922
Forgive me, sweetie.

01:00:50.093 --> 01:00:51.287
Hello.

01:00:51.394 --> 01:00:52.952
Hold on.

01:00:53.062 --> 01:00:55.223
Dad, it's for you.

01:00:56.799 --> 01:00:58.699
He says he's Howard Hughes.

01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:01.798
Hello.

01:01:01.904 --> 01:01:03.872
Is this some kind of...

01:01:08.144 --> 01:01:09.543
I'll be right there.

01:01:14.384 --> 01:01:15.783
Well, I'll be.

01:02:29.725 --> 01:02:31.454
Hi.

01:02:31.561 --> 01:02:33.222
Howard Hughes.

01:02:34.931 --> 01:02:37.832
What do you think
of it, kid?

01:02:37.934 --> 01:02:39.663
It's big.

01:02:39.769 --> 01:02:41.828
That's what
they tell me.

01:02:41.938 --> 01:02:46.375
Here, do you like pistachio nuts?

01:02:46.476 --> 01:02:48.068
Lawyers.

01:02:48.177 --> 01:02:50.077
All they can think about

01:02:50.179 --> 01:02:53.080
is whether it will
fly or not.

01:02:53.182 --> 01:02:55.082
Who cares
whether it flies?

01:02:55.184 --> 01:02:57.482
That's not the point.

01:02:57.587 --> 01:02:59.077
And...

01:02:59.188 --> 01:03:01.019
Spruce Goose.

01:03:01.124 --> 01:03:03.524
Why do they
call it that?

01:03:03.626 --> 01:03:05.526
That seem funny to you?

01:03:05.628 --> 01:03:07.027
I can't tell anymore.

01:03:09.065 --> 01:03:10.498
People.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.467
Did I change, or...

01:03:13.569 --> 01:03:16.970
did the cosmic
sense of humor?

01:03:17.073 --> 01:03:20.907
I used to laugh
when they did.

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:23.240
This...

01:03:23.346 --> 01:03:25.211
prick...

01:03:25.314 --> 01:03:27.179
Homer Ferguson.

01:03:27.283 --> 01:03:29.843
He's after me, too.

01:03:29.952 --> 01:03:33.217
Subpoenaed me
for a congressional investigation

01:03:33.322 --> 01:03:36.382
which either
I show up for,

01:03:36.492 --> 01:03:37.982
in person,

01:03:38.094 --> 01:03:40.562
or he's going
to send me to jail.

01:03:44.467 --> 01:03:46.162
I'm already in jail.

01:03:53.776 --> 01:03:55.676
Steel.

01:03:55.778 --> 01:03:58.178
That's what
I called you about.

01:03:58.281 --> 01:04:00.374
There's
a helicopter plant

01:04:00.483 --> 01:04:02.951
in, uh, Syracuse,

01:04:03.052 --> 01:04:06.613
called the Air-Cooled
Motor Company.

01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:10.089
And they're not connected to any
government agency,

01:04:10.193 --> 01:04:11.421
so...

01:04:13.095 --> 01:04:16.360
the politicians can't
screw you out of it.

01:04:18.768 --> 01:04:20.963
Well, this helicopter company

01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:23.766
has all the steel you need.

01:04:23.873 --> 01:04:27.434
And they're on their ass
financially, so...

01:04:27.543 --> 01:04:30.034
if you hurry up,

01:04:30.146 --> 01:04:31.943
they're ready to deal.

01:04:33.649 --> 01:04:34.741
And they...

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:39.048
they make a really
fine aluminum engine.

01:04:39.155 --> 01:04:41.521
But listen, now.

01:04:41.624 --> 01:04:43.649
For God's sake, now,

01:04:43.759 --> 01:04:44.919
you don't...

01:04:50.233 --> 01:04:52.292
I wonder...

01:04:54.036 --> 01:04:56.937
I wonder how they
get the blood off.

01:05:07.683 --> 01:05:10.083
Well, what do you think, Jimmy?

01:05:10.186 --> 01:05:11.847
It's a helicopter
engine.

01:05:11.954 --> 01:05:13.854
It needs
to be converted

01:05:13.956 --> 01:05:15.355
from air-cooled
to water.

01:05:15.458 --> 01:05:18.256
But as a starting point, maybe.

01:05:18.361 --> 01:05:20.761
It's small,
which is good. Simple.

01:05:20.863 --> 01:05:22.854
I'll work on
the drawings.

01:05:22.965 --> 01:05:24.865
Oh, time. Time.

01:05:24.967 --> 01:05:26.867
Fighting Bennington
would take years.

01:05:26.969 --> 01:05:30.370
Meanwhile, he's retooling his car
as fast as possible.

01:05:30.473 --> 01:05:33.067
We'll have to build
this engine right here

01:05:33.175 --> 01:05:34.574
out of Bennington's sight.

01:05:34.677 --> 01:05:37.111
The Senate War
Investigating Committee

01:05:37.213 --> 01:05:39.613
has subpoenaed aircraft
designer Howard Hughes.

01:05:39.715 --> 01:05:41.615
The committee will
investigate charges...

01:05:41.717 --> 01:05:44.117
We need
a new cam shaft.

01:05:46.155 --> 01:05:49.056
Intake manifold's going
to have to be reworked.

01:05:49.158 --> 01:05:51.558
Excuse me,
but in a helicopter,

01:05:51.661 --> 01:05:54.061
doesn't the engine
stand straight up?

01:05:54.163 --> 01:05:56.063
If we lay our sideways,

01:05:56.165 --> 01:05:59.066
we'll need an oil pan
down there.

01:05:59.168 --> 01:06:00.567
Ha ha ha!

01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:02.069
OK, whatever we do

01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:05.572
has got to fit
into the Franklin assembly line.

01:06:05.675 --> 01:06:07.074
That's it, gentlemen.

01:06:13.282 --> 01:06:15.614
Hey, come on!
Eddie, come on.

01:06:15.718 --> 01:06:17.618
We only got
till tomorrow

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.779
to get this thing
together.

01:06:19.889 --> 01:06:21.789
Click it over.

01:06:24.393 --> 01:06:26.020
Get another battery.

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:39.939
Yay!

01:06:40.042 --> 01:06:40.940
Hey, hey!

01:06:42.078 --> 01:06:42.976
Got it!

01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:48.982
Go ahead! Go ahead!

01:06:49.085 --> 01:06:50.484
There he goes!

01:06:50.586 --> 01:06:51.814
Woo-hoo!

01:06:51.921 --> 01:06:53.320
Just like a swan.

01:06:53.422 --> 01:06:56.323
I want it smooth
like a swan.

01:06:56.425 --> 01:06:57.824
Get out of here!

01:06:57.927 --> 01:06:59.326
You're in the shot!

01:07:02.331 --> 01:07:03.263
Go, Eddie!

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.997
Woo!

01:07:07.103 --> 01:07:08.502
Sounds mighty nice.

01:07:08.604 --> 01:07:09.502
Hey, Eddie!

01:07:09.605 --> 01:07:10.503
Yeah?

01:07:10.606 --> 01:07:12.506
We can drive in relays.

01:07:12.608 --> 01:07:15.509
24 hours without a stop
and push her!

01:07:15.611 --> 01:07:17.511
Push her to the limit!

01:07:19.081 --> 01:07:20.013
Go!

01:07:24.153 --> 01:07:26.053
I hope it holds up.

01:07:29.158 --> 01:07:30.250
Good. Good.

01:07:49.445 --> 01:07:50.343
It's neat.

01:07:50.446 --> 01:07:51.344
Having fun?

01:07:51.447 --> 01:07:52.345
Yeah.

01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:55.249
What have we
got now?

01:07:56.719 --> 01:07:58.550
171/2 hours.

01:08:00.055 --> 01:08:01.181
To go?

01:08:30.352 --> 01:08:31.841
God damn!

01:08:31.953 --> 01:08:34.649
All right, all right.
Stay with him.

01:08:57.645 --> 01:08:58.772
Charlie? Homer.

01:08:58.881 --> 01:09:02.282
That son a bitch Tucker
built the damn thing.

01:09:02.384 --> 01:09:05.216
Well, not everything
he advertised, not yet.

01:09:05.321 --> 01:09:07.220
But enough
to cost billions

01:09:07.323 --> 01:09:09.518
just to keep up
with him.

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:11.456
I'll take care of him.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.993
We did it!

01:09:23.205 --> 01:09:25.069
Hey, Eddie!

01:09:25.174 --> 01:09:27.335
Oh, my God!

01:09:27.443 --> 01:09:28.841
Hold the camera!

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.340
Eddie!

01:09:33.448 --> 01:09:35.349
Eddie,
are you all right?

01:09:35.451 --> 01:09:36.850
Get an
ambulance quick!

01:09:36.952 --> 01:09:38.852
All right.
Now, watch out.

01:09:38.953 --> 01:09:42.014
Watch it. Hold it up.
Watch yourself.

01:09:42.124 --> 01:09:43.352
You OK?

01:09:45.627 --> 01:09:46.526
Blah.

01:09:46.629 --> 01:09:47.527
Yeah.

01:09:49.631 --> 01:09:52.032
Clocked out
just like we said.

01:09:52.134 --> 01:09:54.033
Look at that thing.

01:09:54.136 --> 01:09:55.535
I can't
believe it.

01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:00.441
I bet you 2 bucks
it still runs.

01:10:00.543 --> 01:10:03.444
Go ahead. Start it up.
Let's see.

01:10:05.614 --> 01:10:06.512
Aah!

01:10:06.615 --> 01:10:07.513
Hoo-hoo!

01:10:09.485 --> 01:10:11.476
Told ya.

01:10:11.587 --> 01:10:12.485
Woo!

01:10:12.588 --> 01:10:14.954
All right!

01:10:15.057 --> 01:10:16.752
Woo!

01:10:16.859 --> 01:10:19.259
It's a hell
of a car.

01:10:19.361 --> 01:10:22.262
It's one hell
of a damn car!

01:10:22.364 --> 01:10:25.492
That's a hell of a ride there,
partner.

01:10:26.602 --> 01:10:28.502
You got it, didn't you?

01:10:28.604 --> 01:10:30.003
Yeah, we got it!

01:10:30.105 --> 01:10:33.006
You look like
you didn't get it!

01:10:33.108 --> 01:10:34.507
We got it.

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:35.838
We got it, right?

01:10:35.945 --> 01:10:37.139
We didn't get it.

01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:40.043
That's right.

01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:43.050
We're going to go back
to the original drawings.

01:10:43.152 --> 01:10:44.119
Keep everything
the same...

01:10:44.219 --> 01:10:45.982
the rear engine,
et cetera,

01:10:46.088 --> 01:10:47.487
except for
these numbers...

01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:48.488
13...

01:10:48.591 --> 01:10:50.491
Tucker, what is going on?

01:10:50.593 --> 01:10:52.493
I see you've
resumed production

01:10:52.595 --> 01:10:53.994
on your rear-engine car.

01:10:54.096 --> 01:10:57.156
By whose authority
are you doing this?

01:10:57.266 --> 01:10:59.757
That's the car
you signed for,

01:10:59.868 --> 01:11:01.768
that's the car
we're making.

01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:04.771
If you think
you'll get away with this...

01:11:04.873 --> 01:11:06.807
"Little ships fine,"
Confucius say.

01:11:06.909 --> 01:11:09.810
"Rowboats long in tooth
make big noise,

01:11:09.912 --> 01:11:10.810
go nowhere."

01:11:10.913 --> 01:11:12.881
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:11:12.982 --> 01:11:16.247
Mr. Tucker, you're going to hear
from my attorney.

01:11:16.352 --> 01:11:18.252
You can count
on that.

01:11:18.354 --> 01:11:19.821
Good morning, sir.

01:11:20.923 --> 01:11:22.823
Nothing can
stop us now.

01:11:22.925 --> 01:11:25.018
"You'll hear
from my attorney."

01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:30.130
This beautiful shot
of the grill.

01:11:30.232 --> 01:11:33.133
Now watch this beauty shot
of the side.

01:11:33.235 --> 01:11:35.635
Wait till you see
this attendant.

01:11:35.738 --> 01:11:39.037
He's much better
than that fat guy was.

01:11:39.141 --> 01:11:41.541
Wait till you see
this shot.

01:11:41.644 --> 01:11:42.542
It's great.

01:11:42.645 --> 01:11:45.478
He puts down the rag,
throws it down.

01:11:45.581 --> 01:11:47.981
I took out
kicking the tire.

01:11:48.083 --> 01:11:49.675
This is the best.
Watch.

01:11:49.785 --> 01:11:50.877
Aw! Aw!

01:11:50.986 --> 01:11:52.544
Look at his eyes.

01:11:53.656 --> 01:11:54.554
Now watch.

01:11:54.657 --> 01:11:56.056
Here, I don't know.

01:11:56.158 --> 01:11:58.058
What about a close-up?

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.560
Why did you leave
the tire out?

01:12:00.663 --> 01:12:03.063
The finger.
Do we need it?

01:12:03.165 --> 01:12:06.566
Not the finger,
but the tire.

01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:09.570
Abe, I want you
to see this.

01:12:09.672 --> 01:12:11.970
Stan's promo film.
It's great.

01:12:12.074 --> 01:12:14.042
Come here.
Shh. Come here.

01:12:16.545 --> 01:12:18.536
All right!
All right!

01:12:18.647 --> 01:12:21.946
Turn it off.
I'll see the end later.

01:12:23.552 --> 01:12:24.450
What?

01:12:24.553 --> 01:12:27.044
Did you like it
when he went...

01:12:27.156 --> 01:12:28.054
Yes.

01:12:35.998 --> 01:12:38.899
What's all this cloak and dagger
business now?

01:12:39.001 --> 01:12:40.400
Your office is wired.

01:12:40.502 --> 01:12:41.901
The board room,

01:12:42.004 --> 01:12:43.904
the whole plant,
even washrooms.

01:12:44.006 --> 01:12:46.839
Ever since you road-tested
the new car,

01:12:46.942 --> 01:12:49.706
40 G-men have followed you
around the clock.

01:12:49.812 --> 01:12:52.212
You made the car
too good.

01:12:52.314 --> 01:12:55.215
The whole idea is building
a better mousetrap.

01:12:55.317 --> 01:12:57.217
Not if you're
the mouse.

01:13:00.522 --> 01:13:02.422
What are you
talking about?

01:13:02.524 --> 01:13:04.458
We did it.
We won.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.462
In 2 weeks,
100 cars will come out a day.

01:13:08.564 --> 01:13:11.465
Frank the press agent
says in two weeks

01:13:11.567 --> 01:13:14.968
you'll be dead and buried
by the Big Three.

01:13:23.846 --> 01:13:24.813
Here.

01:13:27.049 --> 01:13:28.641
It's my resignation.

01:13:31.019 --> 01:13:31.986
Take it.

01:13:32.087 --> 01:13:34.487
You're bailing out,
is that it?

01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:37.491
Captains go down
with their ships,

01:13:37.593 --> 01:13:38.491
not businessmen.

01:13:38.594 --> 01:13:40.391
Look me in the eye.

01:13:40.496 --> 01:13:42.225
You're too good
a salesman

01:13:42.331 --> 01:13:45.630
not to look a customer
in the eyes.

01:13:45.734 --> 01:13:47.634
You think
I'm playing games?

01:13:47.736 --> 01:13:50.728
You're trying some double-whammy
hustle backwards! Why?

01:13:50.839 --> 01:13:52.238
I have to say it?

01:13:52.341 --> 01:13:54.241
Yeah. Let's start from there.

01:14:01.717 --> 01:14:02.843
OK.

01:14:05.788 --> 01:14:08.552
I did three years
in the pen

01:14:08.657 --> 01:14:09.988
for bank fraud.

01:14:12.661 --> 01:14:14.026
So what?

01:14:14.129 --> 01:14:16.529
So they'll use it
against you.

01:14:16.632 --> 01:14:20.033
What, you think because of this
piece of paper,

01:14:20.135 --> 01:14:22.000
they're not
going to?

01:14:22.104 --> 01:14:24.072
Leave me alone,
will you?

01:14:25.307 --> 01:14:29.107
The whole 10 years since
I've been in the pen,

01:14:29.211 --> 01:14:33.113
it never bothered me for two seconds
I'm an ex-con.

01:14:33.215 --> 01:14:34.614
Why should it?

01:14:34.716 --> 01:14:35.808
Who cared?

01:14:38.787 --> 01:14:43.724
But for you and Vera
and the kids to know...

01:14:45.561 --> 01:14:48.428
I'm ashamed.

01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:50.327
Abe, come on.

01:14:52.334 --> 01:14:55.167
When I was
a little kid,

01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:58.171
maybe 5 years old
in the old country,

01:14:58.273 --> 01:15:00.173
my mother would warn me,

01:15:00.275 --> 01:15:02.675
"Don't get too close
to people.

01:15:02.778 --> 01:15:05.542
You'll catch
their dreams."

01:15:05.647 --> 01:15:08.480
Years later,
I realized I misunderstood her.

01:15:08.584 --> 01:15:10.211
Germs, she said,
not dreams.

01:15:10.319 --> 01:15:12.116
"You'll catch
their germs."

01:15:15.023 --> 01:15:17.924
I want you to know
something, Tucker.

01:15:18.026 --> 01:15:21.427
I went into business
with you to make money.

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:22.758
That's all.

01:15:22.865 --> 01:15:25.925
How was I to know...

01:15:27.369 --> 01:15:30.770
if I got too close,
I'd catch your dreams?

01:15:41.183 --> 01:15:42.411
Here.

01:15:43.685 --> 01:15:47.348
If you want to know
how they'll finish you off,

01:15:47.456 --> 01:15:50.857
listen to Drew Pearson
tomorrow night on the radio.

01:16:10.145 --> 01:16:10.279
Noble, bring it in!

01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:12.543
Noble, bring it in!

01:16:12.648 --> 01:16:13.637
Don't yell.

01:16:13.749 --> 01:16:15.774
Good evening.
This is Drew Pearson.

01:16:15.884 --> 01:16:18.284
The hottest news
in Washington today

01:16:18.387 --> 01:16:19.786
is about Preston Tucker,

01:16:19.888 --> 01:16:21.719
that promotion happy
self-styled genius

01:16:21.823 --> 01:16:23.222
and revolutionary
auto maker.

01:16:23.325 --> 01:16:24.223
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:16:24.326 --> 01:16:25.725
For several months,

01:16:25.827 --> 01:16:27.624
he has been
under investigation

01:16:27.729 --> 01:16:30.129
by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

01:16:30.232 --> 01:16:33.133
They're ready
to blow the lid off

01:16:33.235 --> 01:16:36.136
one of the slickest
multimillion dollar frauds

01:16:36.238 --> 01:16:38.399
ever perpetrated
on the American people.

01:16:38.507 --> 01:16:40.407
Not only does the car

01:16:40.509 --> 01:16:43.410
have none of the futuristic
features advertised,

01:16:43.512 --> 01:16:45.343
but it was put together

01:16:45.447 --> 01:16:48.473
from parts found
in city dumps.

01:16:48.583 --> 01:16:51.484
Local wags, having dubbed it
the Tin Goose,

01:16:51.586 --> 01:16:52.985
find it
particularly amusing

01:16:53.088 --> 01:16:56.353
that Mr. Tucker's
car of tomorrow

01:16:56.458 --> 01:16:58.358
can't even back up.

01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:59.722
Bull!

01:16:59.828 --> 01:17:02.729
Nor can Mr. Tucker
at this point.

01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:04.230
Senator Homer Ferguson

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:06.233
will spearhead
a congressional probe

01:17:06.335 --> 01:17:09.361
to find out exactly
what happened

01:17:09.471 --> 01:17:12.440
to the $ 26 million
Tucker raised.

01:17:12.541 --> 01:17:13.940
One thing for certain...

01:17:14.042 --> 01:17:16.875
he didn't spend it
making cars.

01:17:16.979 --> 01:17:20.540
The rumor around
Capitol Hill this week...

01:17:26.722 --> 01:17:29.054
They can't say that.

01:17:29.157 --> 01:17:31.387
We'll kill 'em.

01:17:31.493 --> 01:17:34.894
Are you going to let
them say that, pop?

01:17:34.997 --> 01:17:37.898
Who do they think
they're dealing with,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.399
some cream puff?

01:17:41.169 --> 01:17:42.568
They don't know it,

01:17:42.671 --> 01:17:45.003
but they just opened
Aunt Dora's box.

01:17:49.611 --> 01:17:51.511
We love you, daddy.

01:17:53.115 --> 01:17:56.141
But it's Pandora's box.

01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:04.558
Oh, no.

01:18:07.629 --> 01:18:09.529
Good morning,
Miss Yanpaulski.

01:18:09.631 --> 01:18:12.532
When did they take the files,
last night?

01:18:12.634 --> 01:18:13.862
The S.E.C.?

01:18:13.969 --> 01:18:15.596
Nobody touched
anything here.

01:18:15.704 --> 01:18:17.968
I called all
the departments myself.

01:18:18.073 --> 01:18:21.099
Get me the editor
on the phone.

01:18:25.147 --> 01:18:28.275
Can you believe that?

01:18:30.152 --> 01:18:31.983
Nice day.

01:18:32.087 --> 01:18:33.486
You come back here!

01:18:33.588 --> 01:18:35.579
You can't
go in there!

01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:39.456
We're from the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

01:18:39.561 --> 01:18:41.461
We have
a court order

01:18:41.563 --> 01:18:42.962
confiscating
all files,

01:18:43.065 --> 01:18:45.431
letters,
accounting books.

01:18:48.103 --> 01:18:49.502
If you
simply cooperate,

01:18:49.604 --> 01:18:51.003
we'll work quickly.

01:18:51.106 --> 01:18:53.006
That's quite
a newspaper, mister.

01:18:53.108 --> 01:18:55.838
It's the only one
that prints the news

01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:57.411
before it happens.

01:18:57.512 --> 01:18:58.911
So, speaking for myself

01:18:59.014 --> 01:19:01.915
and the other members
of the board,

01:19:02.017 --> 01:19:03.917
we hereby submit
our resignations,

01:19:04.019 --> 01:19:06.283
effective immediately.

01:19:07.722 --> 01:19:09.121
What about
the dealers

01:19:09.224 --> 01:19:10.851
filing suit
against you?

01:19:10.959 --> 01:19:12.859
What about
the district attorney

01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:14.394
confiscating
the company's assets?

01:19:14.496 --> 01:19:15.895
Ladies and gentlemen,
please.

01:19:15.997 --> 01:19:18.090
Address questions
to Mr. Bennington.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.033
How long will
the plant stay open?

01:19:21.136 --> 01:19:23.036
The plant is
officially closed.

01:20:41.349 --> 01:20:42.247
Hey, hey.

01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:43.248
Hey, hey!

01:20:43.351 --> 01:20:44.249
It's dad!

01:20:44.352 --> 01:20:45.182
Yeah.

01:20:59.334 --> 01:21:01.234
Let's see your
driver's license.

01:21:01.336 --> 01:21:03.736
Swell. Where's the girls, huh?

01:21:03.838 --> 01:21:05.237
It comes alone.

01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.238
Hold that.

01:21:06.341 --> 01:21:07.740
Ohh.

01:21:10.512 --> 01:21:12.241
This is a great interior.

01:21:18.687 --> 01:21:20.086
In a week

01:21:20.188 --> 01:21:22.088
we could
push a button

01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:24.681
and produce
100 cars a day.

01:21:24.793 --> 01:21:26.761
Well, tell me
something.

01:21:26.861 --> 01:21:29.591
If 50 cars are
ready by June 1 st,

01:21:29.698 --> 01:21:31.495
they can't take
the plant?

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.693
Not according
to the contract.

01:21:33.802 --> 01:21:36.362
How many cars are
ready right now?

01:21:36.471 --> 01:21:37.369
47.

01:21:37.472 --> 01:21:39.565
We only need
three more?

01:21:39.674 --> 01:21:41.904
Who's going to
do it, though?

01:21:42.010 --> 01:21:43.944
We've worked
for free before.

01:21:44.045 --> 01:21:46.946
Assemble three cars
in four weeks? Ha!

01:21:47.048 --> 01:21:49.812
Can anybody
look me in the eye

01:21:49.918 --> 01:21:51.317
and say we can't?

01:21:52.654 --> 01:21:54.019
We can't do it.

01:21:54.122 --> 01:21:55.089
Except you.

01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.191
- Will you grow a beard?

01:21:58.293 --> 01:22:00.921
Who's he talking to, me?

01:22:01.029 --> 01:22:02.087
Yeah, you.

01:22:02.197 --> 01:22:04.961
You'd look old enough
for a department head.

01:22:05.066 --> 01:22:06.761
Ha ha ha.

01:22:15.844 --> 01:22:16.742
Hello.

01:22:16.845 --> 01:22:18.403
Who's this? You?

01:22:18.513 --> 01:22:19.411
Abe?

01:22:19.514 --> 01:22:20.913
Tucker,
don't go home.

01:22:21.016 --> 01:22:24.076
The police are waiting there
to arrest you.

01:22:24.185 --> 01:22:25.584
Don't go home?

01:22:25.687 --> 01:22:27.086
This you
won't believe...

01:22:27.188 --> 01:22:28.587
outside
the police station,

01:22:28.690 --> 01:22:30.590
maybe there's 50,
100 reporters,

01:22:30.692 --> 01:22:32.091
photographers,
newsreels even.

01:22:32.193 --> 01:22:36.095
They're going to
drag you out in leg irons.

01:22:36.197 --> 01:22:37.289
You're kidding.

01:22:37.399 --> 01:22:38.297
Get out!

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.834
Go somewhere
they can't find you.

01:22:47.809 --> 01:22:49.367
They want headlines.

01:22:49.477 --> 01:22:51.377
I'll give them a beaut!

01:22:51.479 --> 01:22:53.276
Dad, what are you doing?

01:22:53.381 --> 01:22:54.780
I'm going home.

01:23:12.133 --> 01:23:15.034
One of you fellows
have a light?

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.058
Where did he go?

01:24:20.168 --> 01:24:21.396
I don't know.

01:24:21.503 --> 01:24:23.061
We lost him.

01:24:44.192 --> 01:24:45.523
All right!
All right!

01:24:45.627 --> 01:24:47.185
Back off!
Back off!

01:24:47.295 --> 01:24:48.523
Pipe down!

01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:50.689
Quiet!

01:24:51.966 --> 01:24:53.194
Thank you.

01:24:53.301 --> 01:24:56.361
Now, what is
going on here?

01:24:56.471 --> 01:24:57.733
Ask these
officers about

01:24:57.839 --> 01:25:00.034
the 100
mile-an-hour chase

01:25:00.141 --> 01:25:02.871
I gave them
in this poor wreck.

01:25:02.977 --> 01:25:04.376
Want to cuff me, boys?

01:25:04.479 --> 01:25:05.878
Get in there!

01:25:10.285 --> 01:25:11.684
In the local news,

01:25:11.786 --> 01:25:14.687
Preston Tucker
goes on trial this morning

01:25:14.789 --> 01:25:17.690
in the same courthouse
Al Capone was convicted.

01:25:17.792 --> 01:25:19.225
Tucker has been charged

01:25:19.327 --> 01:25:21.727
with 25 counts
of mail fraud,

01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:23.889
five counts
of S.E.C. Violations,

01:25:23.998 --> 01:25:27.058
and one count
of conspiracy to defraud.

01:25:27.168 --> 01:25:30.569
If convicted, Tucker,
who is out on $ 25,000 bail,

01:25:30.672 --> 01:25:34.233
faces a maximum sentence
of 155 years in prison

01:25:34.342 --> 01:25:36.572
plus a $60,000 fine.

01:25:44.619 --> 01:25:45.847
Be seated.

01:25:48.923 --> 01:25:51.756
And regarding his
revolutionary designs,

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.158
we'll prove Mr. Tucker
only designed

01:25:54.262 --> 01:25:56.059
an elaborate
scheme to defraud.

01:25:56.164 --> 01:25:58.860
He only wanted the public's money
for nothing,

01:25:58.967 --> 01:26:01.902
and that's exactly what
the public got... nothing.

01:26:02.003 --> 01:26:03.402
The government
has said

01:26:03.505 --> 01:26:06.406
Mr. Tucker's purpose
was to con the public

01:26:06.508 --> 01:26:09.341
into believing
a great car was coming.

01:26:09.444 --> 01:26:12.538
His real purpose
was to lie

01:26:12.647 --> 01:26:14.114
and get money.

01:26:15.817 --> 01:26:17.216
You all right,
mommy?

01:26:17.318 --> 01:26:19.218
It's very hot
in here.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:22.380
Your father might say
it's not the heat,

01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:24.754
it's the humility.

01:26:24.859 --> 01:26:28.886
The Tucker Corporation
was started in good faith.

01:26:28.997 --> 01:26:33.024
The defendant intended
to mass produce cars.

01:26:33.134 --> 01:26:35.034
His failure to do so

01:26:35.136 --> 01:26:37.900
was caused by a lack
of adequate financing

01:26:38.006 --> 01:26:40.736
due to serious
outside interference.

01:26:58.693 --> 01:27:00.854
I wouldn't put
$ 7,500 down

01:27:00.962 --> 01:27:03.157
on a car dealership

01:27:03.264 --> 01:27:05.459
without a guaranteed
supply of cars.

01:27:05.567 --> 01:27:08.434
They were going to produce
1,000 cars a day.

01:27:08.536 --> 01:27:10.299
I run a service station

01:27:10.405 --> 01:27:12.100
and sell
some used cars.

01:27:12.206 --> 01:27:14.197
Do you see
the person

01:27:14.309 --> 01:27:16.743
who sold you
that dealership?

01:27:16.844 --> 01:27:18.175
Him.

01:27:18.279 --> 01:27:19.678
Let the record state

01:27:19.781 --> 01:27:22.545
that the witness
identified Mr. Abe Karatz.

01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:24.550
Did he disclose
he'd served

01:27:24.652 --> 01:27:26.552
three years
for bank fraud?

01:27:26.654 --> 01:27:29.122
Objection.
Guilt by association.

01:27:29.223 --> 01:27:30.622
Overruled.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.294
Is it not true you were convicted
in June of 1935

01:27:36.397 --> 01:27:38.365
of conspiring
to embezzle funds,

01:27:38.466 --> 01:27:41.492
and you served
three years

01:27:41.603 --> 01:27:43.400
in a federal
penitentiary?

01:27:43.504 --> 01:27:44.835
That's true.

01:27:44.939 --> 01:27:47.499
Tell me,
as a convicted felon,

01:27:47.609 --> 01:27:50.840
do you expect one person
in this entire courtroom

01:27:50.945 --> 01:27:52.845
to believe what you say?

01:28:00.021 --> 01:28:01.147
One.

01:28:15.169 --> 01:28:17.899
A well-run corporation
doesn't waste money

01:28:18.006 --> 01:28:20.031
to research innovations,

01:28:20.141 --> 01:28:21.540
unless, of course,

01:28:21.643 --> 01:28:23.543
keeping up
with the competition

01:28:23.645 --> 01:28:24.543
demands it.

01:28:25.647 --> 01:28:28.047
Here is a man, Mr. Tucker,

01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:29.548
who had
the responsibility

01:28:29.651 --> 01:28:31.710
for forming
a well-run corporation.

01:28:31.819 --> 01:28:34.720
He has the largest
factory in the world,

01:28:34.822 --> 01:28:38.223
containing two foundries,
a dozen tool and die shops,

01:28:38.326 --> 01:28:40.658
every piece of equipment
ever made.

01:28:40.762 --> 01:28:42.923
Can you suggest
why he'd choose

01:28:43.031 --> 01:28:45.625
to build his engine
in a barn?

01:28:45.733 --> 01:28:46.631
Objection!

01:28:46.734 --> 01:28:47.632
Sustained.

01:28:47.735 --> 01:28:49.635
Which had
so little equipment...

01:28:49.737 --> 01:28:51.500
Please confine
your remarks

01:28:51.606 --> 01:28:53.005
to questioning
the witness.

01:28:53.107 --> 01:28:55.507
This trial's
bought and paid for...

01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:58.010
a Christmas present
Detroit gave itself.

01:28:58.112 --> 01:29:01.013
I'll be lucky
to get 15 years.

01:29:01.115 --> 01:29:03.015
He hasn't proven
anything yet.

01:29:03.117 --> 01:29:04.015
Not legally.

01:29:04.118 --> 01:29:07.178
He has if they
think he has.

01:29:19.233 --> 01:29:22.031
I'm an investigating
accountant for the S.E.C.

01:29:22.136 --> 01:29:24.934
What was the amount
the Tucker Corporation paid

01:29:25.039 --> 01:29:27.872
for the prototype
engine and transmission

01:29:27.975 --> 01:29:31.877
which was built entirely from parts
found in junk yards?

01:29:31.979 --> 01:29:35.346
$223,000.

01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:36.348
What?

01:29:36.451 --> 01:29:37.679
That's a lie.

01:29:37.785 --> 01:29:39.685
Who received
this money?

01:29:39.787 --> 01:29:41.948
Ypsilanti Machine
and Tool Company.

01:29:42.056 --> 01:29:44.024
Ypsilanti Machine
and Tool Company.

01:29:44.125 --> 01:29:46.525
Can you describe
their factory?

01:29:46.627 --> 01:29:48.390
What factory?

01:29:48.496 --> 01:29:49.929
It's a barn.

01:29:50.031 --> 01:29:52.932
I can't believe they'd
forge sets of books.

01:29:53.034 --> 01:29:56.026
I've got every
receipt, invoice,

01:29:56.137 --> 01:29:58.196
check,
bank statement.

01:29:58.306 --> 01:29:59.273
Shh.

01:29:59.373 --> 01:30:01.773
Everything to prove
what we spent,

01:30:01.876 --> 01:30:04.606
which is nowhere
near what they said.

01:30:04.712 --> 01:30:06.612
Why would
they do that

01:30:06.714 --> 01:30:08.545
knowing we can
prove otherwise?

01:30:08.649 --> 01:30:10.048
People believe
the newspapers,

01:30:10.151 --> 01:30:11.550
however unbelievable.

01:30:11.652 --> 01:30:13.552
If headlines
say I'm a crook,

01:30:13.654 --> 01:30:16.054
me and the car
are finished.

01:30:16.157 --> 01:30:18.148
That's the whole
idea, right?

01:30:18.259 --> 01:30:21.228
I'll bring every paper
from the files.

01:30:21.329 --> 01:30:23.729
If they make
headlines with lies,

01:30:23.831 --> 01:30:26.095
you'll make bigger
headlines with truth.

01:30:44.352 --> 01:30:45.683
I couldn't sleep.

01:30:45.787 --> 01:30:46.685
Good.

01:30:46.788 --> 01:30:48.688
We could use
some help.

01:31:10.411 --> 01:31:12.811
The evidence suggests
Mr. Tucker diverted

01:31:12.914 --> 01:31:14.814
for his own
personal use

01:31:14.916 --> 01:31:16.315
over a million dollars

01:31:16.417 --> 01:31:19.181
of the stockholders'
money.

01:31:24.859 --> 01:31:27.760
I have a copy of The Detroit News

01:31:27.862 --> 01:31:30.729
with a story about
the S.E.C. Investigation

01:31:30.832 --> 01:31:32.265
of the Tucker Corporation,

01:31:32.366 --> 01:31:35.597
which contains a number
of specific details

01:31:35.703 --> 01:31:37.603
which seem to be verbatim

01:31:37.705 --> 01:31:40.606
from the S.E. C report
admitted as evidence.

01:31:40.708 --> 01:31:43.302
How did The Detroit News
get this information?

01:31:43.411 --> 01:31:44.708
I have no idea.

01:31:47.281 --> 01:31:50.182
Mr. Blue, I have here
a deposition

01:31:50.284 --> 01:31:51.683
from one
Susan McNamara.

01:31:51.786 --> 01:31:54.186
I believe she's
your private secretary,

01:31:54.288 --> 01:31:56.279
in which she states

01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:59.791
she saw you hand
a copy of the report

01:31:59.894 --> 01:32:02.294
to the writer
of that article.

01:32:02.396 --> 01:32:03.795
Furthermore,
you instructed her

01:32:03.898 --> 01:32:06.298
to supply him
with an office

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.799
in a federal building

01:32:07.902 --> 01:32:10.200
in which
to write that article.

01:32:10.304 --> 01:32:12.670
Now, why,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:32:12.773 --> 01:32:14.673
would the S.E.C. Release

01:32:14.775 --> 01:32:16.174
information
about Mr. Tucker,

01:32:16.277 --> 01:32:19.178
which may
or may not be true,

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:23.011
when it is against
S.E.C. Policy to do so?

01:32:23.117 --> 01:32:25.551
The S.E.C.
Isn't on trial.

01:32:25.653 --> 01:32:28.053
If the S.E.C.
Can release information

01:32:28.155 --> 01:32:31.056
for the purpose
of slandering Mr. Tucker's name,

01:32:31.158 --> 01:32:34.184
then lie about it,
like Mr. Blue did...

01:32:34.295 --> 01:32:35.319
Mr. Kirby!

01:32:35.429 --> 01:32:38.193
Then we can't believe
Mr. Tucker stole money.

01:32:38.299 --> 01:32:40.199
You know that's
not permissible.

01:32:40.301 --> 01:32:42.701
Ladies and gentlemen,
I remind you

01:32:42.803 --> 01:32:44.703
the statements
of the attorneys

01:32:44.805 --> 01:32:46.466
are not evidence.

01:32:47.775 --> 01:32:48.799
Mr. Kerner,

01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:50.639
any further witnesses?

01:32:52.446 --> 01:32:54.073
The prosecution rests.

01:32:58.653 --> 01:32:58.786
Number three.

01:32:58.786 --> 01:32:59.548
Number three.

01:32:59.654 --> 01:33:01.554
And that
makes number 50.

01:33:01.656 --> 01:33:03.055
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:33:03.157 --> 01:33:04.556
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:33:04.659 --> 01:33:06.752
Whoo!

01:33:12.733 --> 01:33:14.633
I'm so proud
of you.

01:33:14.735 --> 01:33:15.633
Whoo!

01:33:15.736 --> 01:33:16.634
Hey!

01:33:16.737 --> 01:33:19.171
We did it!

01:33:19.273 --> 01:33:21.298
A week
before deadline.

01:33:21.409 --> 01:33:22.967
It's a real beauty.

01:33:31.319 --> 01:33:33.719
Tomorrow,
it's our turn at bat.

01:33:33.821 --> 01:33:36.722
We'll chop them up
like cat food.

01:33:36.824 --> 01:33:38.724
We've subpoenaed
Ferguson, his wife,

01:33:38.826 --> 01:33:42.227
everybody we need to prove
who started this thing,

01:33:42.330 --> 01:33:43.729
why, and how.

01:33:43.831 --> 01:33:46.664
I want all 50
of these cars

01:33:46.767 --> 01:33:48.166
lined up in front

01:33:48.269 --> 01:33:50.294
at the courthouse
tomorrow morning.

01:33:50.404 --> 01:33:51.996
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:33:52.106 --> 01:33:54.472
Hold that tiger

01:33:54.575 --> 01:33:56.668
Hold that tiger

01:33:56.777 --> 01:33:58.677
Hold that tiger

01:33:58.779 --> 01:34:02.237
Where are they?
Where are the cars?

01:34:08.322 --> 01:34:10.222
We can't wait
any longer.

01:34:10.324 --> 01:34:12.224
Any comment
about the news?

01:34:12.326 --> 01:34:13.224
What news?

01:34:13.327 --> 01:34:15.727
Didn't you read
the paper? Here.

01:34:24.472 --> 01:34:26.372
"Led by Senator Homer Ferguson,

01:34:26.474 --> 01:34:28.203
a special commission

01:34:28.309 --> 01:34:29.708
appointed by President Truman

01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:31.710
ordered
the War Assets Administration

01:34:31.812 --> 01:34:33.712
to evict
the Tucker Corporation

01:34:33.814 --> 01:34:35.714
from the former
aircraft factory

01:34:35.816 --> 01:34:38.717
and give it
to the Lustron Corporation

01:34:38.819 --> 01:34:41.219
for the development
of prefab housing."

01:34:49.263 --> 01:34:50.321
Hey, dad!

01:35:01.342 --> 01:35:02.400
Come on!

01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:04.910
Around the corner!
Around the corner!

01:35:06.781 --> 01:35:09.181
Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

01:35:09.283 --> 01:35:12.013
Around the corner, OK?
Hurry up.

01:35:18.692 --> 01:35:19.681
Hey!

01:35:19.794 --> 01:35:21.193
Hey, hey, hey.

01:35:21.295 --> 01:35:24.196
They're digging up
every street in town.

01:35:24.298 --> 01:35:27.699
We had to go plumb
to China and back.

01:35:27.802 --> 01:35:30.703
I don't get it.
This is the 24th.

01:35:30.805 --> 01:35:33.706
I thought we had
till the first.

01:35:33.808 --> 01:35:36.709
We had till they dropped
the other shoe.

01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:40.579
It's my choice.

01:35:40.681 --> 01:35:42.080
I won't let you...

01:35:42.183 --> 01:35:45.016
They had no right
to take that plant.

01:35:45.119 --> 01:35:46.518
Forget the plant.

01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:49.646
The Tucker car is dead.
That's politics.

01:35:49.757 --> 01:35:52.658
I won't let you cut
your own throat.

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.661
You don't understand how
powerful the forces are

01:35:55.763 --> 01:35:58.163
that are working
against us here.

01:35:58.265 --> 01:36:00.665
I won't let you do it.

01:36:00.768 --> 01:36:02.167
Tucker, look at me.

01:36:02.269 --> 01:36:04.169
Preston, if you're not careful,

01:36:04.271 --> 01:36:07.434
you're going to spend
20 years in prison.

01:36:07.541 --> 01:36:09.907
We will be developing
prefab houses.

01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:12.410
Good to see you,
Senator Ferguson.

01:36:12.513 --> 01:36:15.414
These will be for people
with low income.

01:36:15.516 --> 01:36:18.417
I never thought
I'd see a politician

01:36:18.519 --> 01:36:21.579
with his hands
in his own pockets.

01:36:34.802 --> 01:36:38.238
The defense has chosen
not to call any witnesses

01:36:38.339 --> 01:36:41.240
because we feel
the prosecution has failed

01:36:41.342 --> 01:36:43.674
to make its case.

01:36:43.777 --> 01:36:45.608
And in addition,
your honor,

01:36:45.713 --> 01:36:47.112
the defendant
would like

01:36:47.214 --> 01:36:49.114
to beg
the court's permission

01:36:49.216 --> 01:36:51.844
to make the closing
statements himself

01:36:51.952 --> 01:36:54.853
in the feeling
that perhaps only he

01:36:54.955 --> 01:36:57.856
can put this trial
in its proper perspective.

01:36:59.593 --> 01:37:00.685
No objection.

01:37:03.764 --> 01:37:05.664
Well, permission granted.

01:37:05.766 --> 01:37:08.667
But if anything you say
is unacceptable

01:37:08.769 --> 01:37:12.068
in a court of law,
I'll stop you.

01:37:14.775 --> 01:37:16.174
Thank you,
Your Honor.

01:37:16.277 --> 01:37:17.835
Thank you,
Senator.

01:37:17.945 --> 01:37:20.846
Tell them an honest attempt
means not guilty.

01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:24.478
The prosecution...

01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.021
claims that I never had
any intention

01:37:29.123 --> 01:37:30.522
of building any cars,

01:37:30.624 --> 01:37:35.027
that all I wanted was
to take the money and run.

01:37:35.129 --> 01:37:37.529
If you decide
that they're right,

01:37:37.631 --> 01:37:38.859
well, I'm guilty.

01:37:40.801 --> 01:37:42.701
But according
to the law,

01:37:42.803 --> 01:37:45.636
if I tried
to make the cars,

01:37:45.739 --> 01:37:48.139
even if they weren't
any good,

01:37:48.242 --> 01:37:50.642
even if I didn't
make any...

01:37:50.744 --> 01:37:54.942
but if you believe
that I tried,

01:37:55.049 --> 01:37:57.449
well, then,
I'm not guilty.

01:37:57.551 --> 01:38:00.281
It's not against the law
to be stupid,

01:38:00.387 --> 01:38:02.912
which I was,
building that prototype.

01:38:03.023 --> 01:38:06.982
What nobody has said
is that after the prototype,

01:38:07.094 --> 01:38:10.495
I built the car
that I said I would.

01:38:10.598 --> 01:38:14.034
There are 50 of them
parked on Adam Street.

01:38:14.134 --> 01:38:17.297
All you have to do
is see them,

01:38:17.404 --> 01:38:20.237
and the trial's over.
OK, your honor?

01:38:20.341 --> 01:38:22.241
Objection.
Inadmissible evidence.

01:38:22.343 --> 01:38:23.605
Sustained.

01:38:23.711 --> 01:38:27.112
Please allow the jury
to look out the window.

01:38:27.214 --> 01:38:28.238
Objection.

01:38:28.349 --> 01:38:30.783
You can see them
from here.

01:38:30.884 --> 01:38:33.785
This whole thing's
about whether I intended

01:38:33.887 --> 01:38:35.752
to build the cars.

01:38:35.856 --> 01:38:38.825
Will the defendant abstain
from this flagrant...

01:38:38.926 --> 01:38:40.416
Mr. Tucker!

01:38:40.527 --> 01:38:42.995
Bailiffs,
restrain the defendant.

01:38:43.097 --> 01:38:44.621
Wha... why did l...

01:38:44.732 --> 01:38:46.324
Let the man speak!

01:38:46.433 --> 01:38:49.231
Let's hear
the rest of it!

01:38:54.708 --> 01:38:56.767
If this
behavior continues,

01:38:56.877 --> 01:39:01.177
I may have to declare this
a mistrial.

01:39:01.282 --> 01:39:04.809
I will not tolerate
one more outburst

01:39:04.918 --> 01:39:08.684
of any kind from anybody
in this courtroom!

01:39:08.789 --> 01:39:09.721
I'm sorry.

01:39:14.094 --> 01:39:16.494
You have one minute,
Mr. Tucker.

01:39:18.265 --> 01:39:19.664
Thank you,
Your Honor.

01:39:36.784 --> 01:39:40.185
When I was a boy
I used to, uh...

01:39:40.287 --> 01:39:43.188
I used to read
all about Edison

01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:44.689
and the Wright brothers,

01:39:44.792 --> 01:39:45.850
Mr. Ford...

01:39:45.959 --> 01:39:47.688
they were my heroes.

01:39:47.795 --> 01:39:49.194
Rags to riches,

01:39:49.296 --> 01:39:52.197
that's not just
the name of a book,

01:39:52.299 --> 01:39:55.200
that's what this country
was all about.

01:39:55.302 --> 01:39:57.702
We invented the free
enterprise system

01:39:57.805 --> 01:40:00.706
where anybody,
no matter who he was,

01:40:00.808 --> 01:40:04.209
where he came from,
what class he belonged to,

01:40:04.311 --> 01:40:07.212
if he came up
with a better idea

01:40:07.314 --> 01:40:08.372
about anything,

01:40:08.482 --> 01:40:12.213
there's no limit
to how far he could go.

01:40:12.319 --> 01:40:15.720
I grew up a generation
too late, I guess,

01:40:15.823 --> 01:40:18.724
because now the way
the system works,

01:40:18.826 --> 01:40:22.227
the crackpot who comes up
with some crazy idea

01:40:22.329 --> 01:40:23.728
that everybody laughs at,

01:40:23.831 --> 01:40:26.732
that later turns out
to revolutionize the world,

01:40:26.834 --> 01:40:28.233
he's squashed from above.

01:40:28.335 --> 01:40:31.236
The bureaucrats would
rather kill a new idea

01:40:31.338 --> 01:40:33.602
than let it
rock the boat.

01:40:33.707 --> 01:40:36.107
Today, Benjamin Franklin
would be arrested

01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:39.077
for sailing a kite
without a license.

01:40:39.179 --> 01:40:40.146
It's true.

01:40:40.247 --> 01:40:42.807
We're all puffed up
with ourselves now

01:40:42.916 --> 01:40:45.407
'cause we
invented the bomb.

01:40:45.519 --> 01:40:47.487
Dropped the...

01:40:49.089 --> 01:40:52.490
Beat the daylights
out of the Japanese, the Nazis.

01:40:52.593 --> 01:40:53.992
But if big business

01:40:54.094 --> 01:40:56.688
closes the door
on the little guy

01:40:56.797 --> 01:40:58.196
with a new idea,

01:40:58.298 --> 01:41:00.698
we're closing the door
on progress

01:41:00.801 --> 01:41:03.201
and sabotaging
everything we fought for,

01:41:03.303 --> 01:41:06.204
everything that
the country stands for.

01:41:09.543 --> 01:41:10.942
We're going
to find ourselves

01:41:11.044 --> 01:41:13.478
at the bottom of the heap,

01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:16.481
having no idea
how we got there,

01:41:16.583 --> 01:41:19.518
buying radios and cars
from our former enemies.

01:41:22.689 --> 01:41:25.089
I don't believe
that's going to happen.

01:41:25.192 --> 01:41:27.717
I can't believe it
because...

01:41:28.962 --> 01:41:32.363
if I stop believing
in the common horse sense

01:41:32.466 --> 01:41:33.865
of the American people,

01:41:33.967 --> 01:41:35.366
there'd be no way

01:41:35.469 --> 01:41:38.870
I could get out of bed
in the morning.

01:41:49.082 --> 01:41:50.276
Thank you.

01:42:02.396 --> 01:42:04.956
Why did I
let you do that?

01:42:23.317 --> 01:42:24.545
Be seated.

01:42:29.490 --> 01:42:32.084
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

01:42:34.261 --> 01:42:35.728
We have, Your Honor.

01:42:41.301 --> 01:42:44.099
Will the defendant
please rise.

01:42:47.875 --> 01:42:50.275
We, the jurors...

01:42:51.879 --> 01:42:53.312
find the defendant...

01:42:53.413 --> 01:42:55.973
Preston Tucker...

01:42:58.719 --> 01:42:59.686
Not guilty.

01:43:20.073 --> 01:43:21.973
How about all of you

01:43:22.075 --> 01:43:25.476
take a ride in
one of those Tucker cars

01:43:25.579 --> 01:43:26.978
that don't exist?

01:43:41.094 --> 01:43:41.992
Look.

01:43:42.095 --> 01:43:46.054
They love the cars,
the people.

01:43:46.166 --> 01:43:48.191
Drives me crazy.

01:43:48.302 --> 01:43:51.567
The Tucker Motor Company's dead.

01:43:51.672 --> 01:43:53.970
They'll never be made.

01:43:54.074 --> 01:43:55.473
We made them.

01:43:55.576 --> 01:43:56.941
50 cars.

01:43:58.845 --> 01:44:00.244
Well, what's
the difference,

01:44:00.347 --> 01:44:01.746
50 or 50 million?

01:44:01.848 --> 01:44:03.247
That's only machinery.

01:44:05.586 --> 01:44:09.545
It's the idea
that counts, Abe...

01:44:09.656 --> 01:44:11.317
and the dream.

01:45:07.247 --> 01:45:09.647
What are you
up to now?

01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:11.650
If I could figure out

01:45:11.752 --> 01:45:14.653
how to make these kerosene
refrigerators cheap enough

01:45:14.755 --> 01:45:17.155
so poor people
could afford them.

01:45:17.257 --> 01:45:19.088
Big enough for
two bottles of milk.

01:45:19.192 --> 01:45:20.591
That's all.

01:45:20.694 --> 01:45:24.095
So their kids won't
have to get rickets, see?

01:45:24.197 --> 01:45:26.688
Hold that tiger

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.290
Hold that tiger

01:45:28.402 --> 01:45:30.495
Hold that tiger

01:45:31.305 --> 01:45:37.445
