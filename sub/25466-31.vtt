08:58.755 --> 09:00.583
Of course, it does,
you dang goat boy.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.368
-[screams]
-Now, listen, and learn.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.456
[dings]

09:04.500 --> 09:06.154
So once upon a time,

09:06.197 --> 09:08.069
my man, Jason, was on a quest
for the golden fleece,

09:08.112 --> 09:10.854
because he knew it'd make him
a great screenwriter.

09:10.898 --> 09:13.857
Son, give up this foolish quest
to be screenwriter,

09:13.901 --> 09:15.729
and work with me
here on docks.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.034
No way, Dad.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.601
I'm gonna make it big
in Hollywood.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.560
You'll see.

09:20.603 --> 09:23.388
[Cyborg] Now,
a golden fleece story
always needs a team.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.477
So Jason hired
a bunch of dudes...

09:25.521 --> 09:26.870
[all] That's what's up.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.393
[Cyborg] ...and my
main man, Hercules,

09:28.437 --> 09:29.743
because he was strong

09:29.786 --> 09:31.875
in his screenplay knowledge.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.313
If you have the problems
in the Act Three,

09:35.357 --> 09:39.143
it is because you have
the problems in the Act One.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.755
Okay, now that everything's
been established,

09:41.798 --> 09:43.408
we're heading straight
to Act Two.

09:43.452 --> 09:44.584
[motor revs]

09:44.627 --> 09:46.586
[brakes screech]

09:46.629 --> 09:47.674
[dings]

09:47.717 --> 09:49.240
What happens in Act Two?

09:49.284 --> 09:50.894
Fun and games, baby.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.853
[dings]

09:52.896 --> 09:55.116
Man, we are doing so much fun
than we are doing.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.204
[laughing]

09:56.247 --> 09:58.075
These funs and games
is tight, yo.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.600
Oh, but it's not all
fun and games though.

10:00.643 --> 10:03.428
-[rumbling]
-Here comes the midpoint.

10:03.472 --> 10:04.604
[dings]

10:04.647 --> 10:05.953
[all scream]

10:07.519 --> 10:08.869
[all grunting]

10:08.912 --> 10:10.000
That was rough.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.133
[crying] We lost everything.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.395
[dings]

10:13.438 --> 10:15.745
Awesome, that means
we made it to Act Three.

10:15.789 --> 10:16.790
[dings]

10:16.833 --> 10:18.313
Now, let's grab that fleece.

10:24.058 --> 10:24.928
[dings]

10:24.972 --> 10:27.452
It's just some olds computer.

10:27.496 --> 10:28.671
Yeah, it is.

10:28.715 --> 10:31.456
Hercules, will you
school these fools?

10:31.500 --> 10:33.023
In the golden fleece story,

10:33.067 --> 10:34.938
the hero learns that his goal

10:34.982 --> 10:37.071
was something else
the entire time.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.202
[all gasp]

10:38.246 --> 10:39.290
Wow.

10:39.334 --> 10:40.770
That's right.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.511
A golden fleece won't
make you a successful writer.

10:42.554 --> 10:45.296
But a laptop with
screenwriting software will.

10:45.340 --> 10:48.256
Booyah, time to make it big
in Hollywood, baby.

10:48.299 --> 10:50.650
[Cyborg] And, so,
Jason wrote his screenplay,

10:50.693 --> 10:52.260
[dings]

10:52.303 --> 10:54.741
but, unfortunately, it never
got made into a movie.

10:54.784 --> 10:57.526
[in normal voice]
Yes, and had he listened
to his father

10:57.569 --> 11:01.008
Jason could've avoided
the heartbreak of being
a failed screenwriter.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.663
Failed? Man, you don't know
how Hollywood works.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.752
Jason sold several screenplays,

11:05.795 --> 11:06.970
they never got made.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.798
But my man still got paid.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.408
[Beast Boy]
♪ Got the money Got the money, got the money ♪

11:10.452 --> 11:11.671
[Raven] Yeah. Got the money.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.455
You know what, forget it.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.979
You guys will never learn
to respect authority.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.721
Nah, mans,
we respects authority.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.332
Just not no half goat man's
authority.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.594
[laughs]

11:22.638 --> 11:24.161
[all laughing]

11:24.205 --> 11:25.206
Goat man.

11:26.294 --> 11:27.730
[bleats]
