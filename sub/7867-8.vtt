01:07.450 --> 01:10.780
Sir, we're two minutes from landing
at the Billionaires' Retreat.

01:10.781 --> 01:13.371
Ah, my favorite week
of the year.

01:13.372 --> 01:17.848
Sophisticated financial discussions
with my fellow plutocrats.

01:17.949 --> 01:19.723
Food fight!

01:20.727 --> 01:22.654
Take that, Ted Turner.

01:22.655 --> 01:25.420
In your face,
founder of Facebook.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.691
Skinny-dip!

01:40.692 --> 01:42.015
Yay!

01:43.588 --> 01:45.290
Yee-haw!

01:48.554 --> 01:50.316
Gangway!

02:03.451 --> 02:06.545
"Men."
The room for me.

02:10.995 --> 02:12.763
Nice prank, Simpson.

02:12.769 --> 02:16.543
I dare you to dump that bees' nest
on those second grade babies.

02:16.548 --> 02:17.761
Why would I want to?

02:17.766 --> 02:21.361
Because I said, "I dare you."
Kearney, can you read it back?

02:22.356 --> 02:24.851
"Nice prank, Simpson.
"I dare you to...

02:24.857 --> 02:27.423
"dump that bees' nest
on those second grade babies.

02:27.428 --> 02:30.003
"Bart: Why would I want to?
"Jimbo: Because I said,

02:30.017 --> 02:32.383
'I dare you.'
"Kearney, can you read it back?

02:32.385 --> 02:34.481
"Kearney, reading:
"'Nice prank, Simpson,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.401
- I dare you to...'"
- The point is, Simpson,

02:36.407 --> 02:39.351
a dare has been placed
on your nards.

02:39.358 --> 02:41.332
My nards accept.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.952
Stingamajigs!

02:46.248 --> 02:48.443
Save yourselves!

02:52.465 --> 02:53.473
Huh?

02:53.488 --> 02:56.012
- Where are the bees?
- No bees?

02:56.016 --> 02:58.023
- Dare annulled.
- Can I appeal?

02:58.025 --> 03:01.223
Yeah, appeal to other guys,
Captain Wuss!

03:04.075 --> 03:07.943
Other than the birth of my kid,
this is my happiest moment.

03:09.316 --> 03:11.211
All the bees are dead.

03:11.218 --> 03:13.862
Aye, lass.
The bees are dyin'.

03:13.868 --> 03:16.230
And not just here.
All over the world,

03:16.238 --> 03:19.022
from Glasgow
clear to Edinburgh.

03:19.026 --> 03:20.960
And no one knows why.

03:32.667 --> 03:35.610
I've lost a lot
of wee friends of late.

03:35.896 --> 03:38.361
Willie, I didn't know
you were an apiarist.

03:38.366 --> 03:41.251
From context, I can tell
that means beekeeper.

03:41.257 --> 03:45.031
'Tis a tragedy, Lisa.
No man should outlive his bees.

03:45.136 --> 03:47.710
They're stinging God now.

04:04.588 --> 04:08.320
And the call from the SEC

04:08.327 --> 04:13.110
was coming from inside
their own brokerage house.

04:13.115 --> 04:15.513
Jeff Bezos wet his pants!

04:15.516 --> 04:18.841
I did not. That was apple
juice from before.

04:19.867 --> 04:22.480
- I fold.
- I raise a million dollars....

04:22.487 --> 04:25.522
and to sweeten the pot,
my assistant, Smithers.

04:25.525 --> 04:27.701
If you lose me, sir,
may I say what an honor

04:27.706 --> 04:29.611
- it's been to...
- Bets don't talk.

04:29.616 --> 04:31.062
They see and raise.

04:33.607 --> 04:37.253
Well, if we're betting people,
I got a whole herd of them.

04:37.256 --> 04:39.763
My professional basketball team:

04:39.776 --> 04:41.771
the Austin Celtics.

04:43.527 --> 04:46.500
Well, they're hardly worth a Smithers,
but we don't have all night.

04:46.507 --> 04:49.020
Can you beat nine high?

04:49.808 --> 04:51.852
Damn. Eight high.

04:52.028 --> 04:55.313
So, I own a basketball team,
do I?

04:55.317 --> 04:57.121
Take good care
of them, Burnsie.

04:57.128 --> 04:59.923
Don't let the forwards mix
with the guards.

04:59.926 --> 05:01.761
And if they're acting sluggish,

05:01.768 --> 05:04.630
slip some steroids
into their cocaine.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.322
Mm-hmm.

05:08.257 --> 05:11.161
Fortune Four
lotto numbers are: nine...

05:11.168 --> 05:12.961
- Pfft... knew it.
- seven...

05:12.968 --> 05:14.291
- Duh.
- three...

05:14.297 --> 05:15.500
- What?!
- and...

05:15.508 --> 05:16.641
Boring.

05:16.645 --> 05:19.771
Dad, we have to do something.
All the bees are dying.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.332
Oh, no, no bees?

05:22.335 --> 05:26.801
Ooh, now who will sting me
and walk all over my sandwiches?

05:26.815 --> 05:29.641
But Dad,
bees pollinate flowers.

05:29.647 --> 05:32.802
Flowers: the painted whores
of the plant world.

05:32.807 --> 05:35.431
No bees means no honey.

05:44.256 --> 05:45.692
<i>Synthetic honey.</i>

05:45.695 --> 05:47.550
<i>Just like you remember.</i>

05:48.256 --> 05:50.013
Honey?

05:51.876 --> 05:53.453
Thank you.

06:01.006 --> 06:02.492
D'oh!

06:02.736 --> 06:06.460
I never dreamed the future
could be scary.

06:06.465 --> 06:07.601
Let's go, Lisa.

06:07.605 --> 06:09.663
We've got some worms to save.

06:09.666 --> 06:11.782
- Bees.
- Worms, bees, ticks, fleas.

06:11.795 --> 06:13.253
Let's go, go, go!

06:13.265 --> 06:15.052
I'm glad you called me.

06:15.067 --> 06:18.091
I know I'm not the first
scientist in the phone book.

06:18.097 --> 06:20.490
That's Associate
Professor Aaron Ableman.

06:20.497 --> 06:22.052
How I hate him.

06:22.807 --> 06:26.043
Thundering thorax,
it's just exactly what I feared!

06:27.226 --> 06:29.430
In there, close.

06:29.435 --> 06:31.452
See these red dots?

06:31.455 --> 06:34.821
This bee has been felled
by bee measles...

06:34.827 --> 06:37.522
or, as I call it, "beasles".

06:37.525 --> 06:39.443
Animals can get sick?

06:39.448 --> 06:41.600
I'm going to talk
to the girl from now on.

06:41.608 --> 06:42.632
You're the nerd.

06:42.635 --> 06:46.232
What we need to do now is find
enough uninfected bees

06:46.238 --> 06:47.961
to start a healthy colony.

06:47.977 --> 06:50.322
This pheromone
should attract them.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.180
Marry me,
and I'll support you for life.

06:55.187 --> 06:58.232
You're not a bee!
This thing is useless.

06:59.818 --> 07:01.871
There's one on Lisa.

07:03.115 --> 07:05.863
Hold still, sweetie.
Daddy will kill it.

07:05.865 --> 07:09.661
And this time, no screwups.

07:10.738 --> 07:13.453
Stop, stop,
it's an uninfected queen!

07:13.726 --> 07:15.742
How do we catch her
without hurting her?

07:15.747 --> 07:19.603
Uh, unfortunately, the best method is
to allow her to sting you.

07:19.608 --> 07:21.361
Yeah, much like that.

07:21.368 --> 07:24.371
Now squeeze around the stinger
to keep her attached,

07:24.378 --> 07:28.812
and a colony of bees
will soon form around your face.

07:32.317 --> 07:37.253
Now just keep them there until
the colony is healthy and thriving.

07:37.255 --> 07:38.601
How long is that?

07:38.616 --> 07:42.623
Long enough that you will be known
as Springfield's crazy bee girl.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.162
She likes the stingers.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.333
Marge, remember when we were talking
about our worst fears?

07:49.336 --> 07:52.193
- Uh-huh.
- Mine was snakes, and yours was...

07:52.207 --> 07:53.931
Never being a grandmother.

07:53.937 --> 07:56.733
Really? I thought it was Lisa
with a beard of bees.

07:56.735 --> 07:58.542
Well, whatever...
brace yourself.

08:03.717 --> 08:04.953
President Lincoln!

08:04.955 --> 08:08.130
You've come back,
and you got rid of that hat.

08:08.138 --> 08:10.023
You've got my vote.

08:12.067 --> 08:14.430
Lisa, I don't like this at all.

08:14.435 --> 08:17.512
It's not for long. But until they find
a suitable habitat,

08:17.528 --> 08:20.251
this beard is the only hope
for these bees.

08:20.257 --> 08:23.922
Relax, Mom. I'll mold them into a
shape you know and love.

08:26.665 --> 08:29.092
Stop Milhousing your sister.

08:30.275 --> 08:32.893
Now take it off
before they sting you.

08:32.898 --> 08:35.621
Actually, bees rarely sting
when they're in a cluster.

08:35.626 --> 08:38.102
They only attack
to defend their hive.

08:38.116 --> 08:41.520
I don't know.
All it takes is one troubled loner.

08:41.525 --> 08:44.520
Please let me keep them
for just a little longer.

08:46.755 --> 08:49.393
Okay.
One night.

08:52.935 --> 08:56.503
So, let's see how my burly-bottomed
ball handlers are faring.

08:57.138 --> 08:58.910
Smithers, we're leading
two to nothing.

08:58.916 --> 09:01.491
Run out the clock, boys.
Run out the clock.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.680
Oh, yeah, three points!

09:08.686 --> 09:10.941
Big three in the Big D
for the Big C.

09:10.947 --> 09:12.891
Mark Cuban...
that's me.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.751
Who is that man,

09:14.765 --> 09:16.870
and why isn't his enthusiasm
being punished?

09:16.875 --> 09:18.110
That's Mark Cuban, sir.

09:18.115 --> 09:20.692
He's the most flamboyant
owner in the league.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.120
I'm out of my mind!

09:26.504 --> 09:27.736
How odd.

09:27.731 --> 09:30.435
His money seems to have
bought him happiness.

09:34.125 --> 09:36.103
I'd like to meet him,
Smithers.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.303
So, you made your money
in nuclear power?

09:38.308 --> 09:40.521
I can't remember how
I made my money.

09:40.607 --> 09:42.153
If you're really a billionaire,

09:42.158 --> 09:44.452
give me the secret
billionaires' handshake.

09:44.456 --> 09:46.431
- Smithers, turn away.
- Yay!

10:05.315 --> 10:09.093
So, tell me, why don't you recoil from
the public like a normal billionaire?

10:09.096 --> 10:12.440
Hey, why own a basketball team
if you're not gonna have any fun?

10:12.457 --> 10:13.680
Fun?

10:13.686 --> 10:16.211
Is that how it's pronounced?
I've only seen it written.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.612
Hold that thought. No one's paid
attention to me for ten whole seconds.

10:24.338 --> 10:27.022
It's time for this peacock
to show his feathers.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.613
You know, the feathers
with the big eye

10:28.615 --> 10:30.012
that trick them into
thinking that's my front?

10:30.016 --> 10:32.543
Said feathers are what I'll flaunt.

10:34.966 --> 10:38.842
Uh, Mom, maybe you shouldn't have
put so much syrup on the pancakes.

10:39.698 --> 10:42.403
The secret is not
to swallow the stingers.

10:44.106 --> 10:47.912
- Dad, don't eat the bees!
- They're just drones, Lisa.

10:47.916 --> 10:49.991
They only live for,
like, five minutes anyway.

10:49.997 --> 10:53.670
And they only have haploid cells,
not diploid like me and Bart.

10:53.677 --> 10:54.550
Yeah!

10:54.555 --> 10:58.260
Listen, Lisa, I was trying to think
of a way to help your bees,

10:58.268 --> 11:02.260
and I remembered this abandoned
greenhouse outside of town.

11:02.267 --> 11:03.803
Which used to be a beautiful,

11:03.805 --> 11:06.930
thriving greenhouse till
I was hired to run it.

11:07.578 --> 11:11.100
Your bees will have plenty
of room in this old greenhouse.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.770
Plus, there are flowers,
and it's near a prison,

11:13.775 --> 11:15.782
so they'll have a place
to sting people.

11:15.787 --> 11:17.780
Oh, Mom, it's perfect!

11:17.788 --> 11:20.890
Go live your lives.
Get off my face!

11:22.868 --> 11:24.302
Oh, I miss them.

11:24.316 --> 11:27.060
Now you know how I'll feel
when you go to college.

11:27.076 --> 11:29.432
You'll always have Bart.
Always.

11:29.438 --> 11:32.711
But he'll be gone a lot
repairing refrigerators.

11:32.956 --> 11:34.293
Always.

11:34.798 --> 11:37.152
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:37.155 --> 11:40.092
please welcome your new,
fun-loving owner.

11:40.095 --> 11:41.550
You've seen him on the cover

11:41.558 --> 11:45.202
of the December 1943 issue
of Collier's Magazine.

11:45.207 --> 11:47.990
Montgomery Burns!

11:55.277 --> 11:56.161
Silence!

11:56.166 --> 11:59.152
Now, let's make some noise for
everyone's favorite basketball team,

11:59.156 --> 12:03.031
whom I have renamed
the Springfield Excitement.

12:03.035 --> 12:04.511
I knew it!

12:05.548 --> 12:08.770
Now I would like
to sing our National Anthem.

12:08.778 --> 12:12.343
My country 'tis of thee

12:12.346 --> 12:15.851
Austria, Hungary

12:15.856 --> 12:18.312
Obey your king...

12:18.318 --> 12:19.710
Sir, the Archduke is dead.

12:19.727 --> 12:21.623
What?!
The Archduke is dead?

12:21.627 --> 12:22.950
And the empire is destroyed.

12:22.958 --> 12:24.590
- Then what happened?
- World War I.

12:24.595 --> 12:26.040
- Then what?
- World War II.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.472
- Then what?
- A postwar period.

12:27.477 --> 12:28.841
- Then what?
- The Cold War.

12:28.846 --> 12:29.961
Then what?

12:30.047 --> 12:31.061
Then what?

12:31.535 --> 12:33.093
- Then what?
- The European Union.

12:33.108 --> 12:35.463
The European Union?!
Good heavens!

12:35.637 --> 12:37.873
Ladies, hold onto your husbands!

12:37.876 --> 12:42.790
It's time for the saucy antics
of Springfield's own Basket-belles.

12:48.485 --> 12:50.193
Enough of this vulgarity.

12:50.197 --> 12:52.290
Back to your brothel, harlots!

12:52.615 --> 12:54.362
Now, enjoy your game

12:54.368 --> 12:56.733
and the madcap antics
of the free-wheeling

12:56.735 --> 12:59.310
title-holder of this asset:
me!

13:00.268 --> 13:01.942
<i>Hiphop hooray</i>

13:02.278 --> 13:04.140
<i>Ho, hey</i>

13:04.597 --> 13:06.770
<i>Ho, hey</i>

13:06.966 --> 13:09.021
<i>Ho, hey</i>

13:09.108 --> 13:10.322
<i>Ho</i>

13:10.326 --> 13:11.871
<i>You drew a picture
on my money</i>

13:11.875 --> 13:13.392
<i>But you couldn't make my...</i>

13:14.905 --> 13:16.461
Sir, were those real bullets?

13:16.465 --> 13:18.852
- Yes. Was that a real gorilla?
- No.

13:18.878 --> 13:19.973
I see.

13:22.765 --> 13:25.623
Uh, sir, your escapades,
while well-intentioned,

13:25.635 --> 13:27.930
seem to be driving away our fans.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.871
We have to turn
this business around!

13:29.877 --> 13:32.580
Time to think
outside the boxeola.

13:32.588 --> 13:35.020
What would Mark Cuban do?

13:36.388 --> 13:38.491
I'm out of my mind!

13:40.506 --> 13:41.922
That's not much help.

13:42.078 --> 13:43.342
Build a new arena.

13:43.346 --> 13:44.461
State-of-the-art!

13:44.827 --> 13:46.822
New arena.

13:59.645 --> 14:03.223
That's it, men.
Pave and tar the way God intended.

14:03.225 --> 14:05.400
Mr. Burns, you can't do this!

14:05.408 --> 14:08.580
I can, I shall, and in the future,
I will have done.

14:08.587 --> 14:10.610
I cannot be stopped!

14:12.167 --> 14:15.440
Kill his acorns
and make him watch.

14:16.558 --> 14:18.201
First, one announcement.

14:18.207 --> 14:21.703
I regret to inform you
we are not offering childcare tonight.

14:21.708 --> 14:24.502
I don't know who that guy was
you were leaving your kids with.

14:24.516 --> 14:26.362
Now, without further ado,

14:26.365 --> 14:29.650
let's get ready to referendum!

14:30.037 --> 14:33.213
There's only one place in town
where the bees can survive,

14:33.218 --> 14:35.971
and Mr. Burns wants
to tear it down.

14:36.646 --> 14:37.740
Please, people.

14:37.748 --> 14:39.920
You didn't listen
to me about the snail darter,

14:39.935 --> 14:41.883
you didn't listen to me
about the osprey,

14:41.888 --> 14:44.392
and you didn't listen to me
about the javelina.

14:44.395 --> 14:45.930
The feisty pig of the desert?

14:45.935 --> 14:47.891
Apparently not feisty enough.

14:47.908 --> 14:50.093
Future generations
will judge us

14:50.096 --> 14:52.833
by how we cared for
the tiniest creatures.

14:52.838 --> 14:55.631
I am not just asking you
to save the bees.

14:55.638 --> 14:58.850
I am asking you
to save your souls.

15:01.715 --> 15:04.043
Excellent speech.
Just excellent.

15:04.047 --> 15:07.870
I no longer wish to build my magnificent
new basketball stadium.

15:07.878 --> 15:10.121
- You don't?
- Heavens no!

15:10.428 --> 15:11.790
No skyboxes.

15:11.796 --> 15:13.550
No kiss cam.

15:13.566 --> 15:16.820
Nor will we have the chance
to marvel at number one draft pick

15:16.825 --> 15:19.711
Muk Mu, the human North Pole.

15:21.367 --> 15:24.983
No, I'm afraid he'll be on the first
kayak back to Ketchikan.

15:24.986 --> 15:26.851
Noooooooooooooo!

15:26.858 --> 15:30.173
- Please, don't take our freak!
- I love you, Muk Mu!

15:30.177 --> 15:32.540
Muk Mu! Muk Mu!

15:32.545 --> 15:37.223
All those in favor of building this
decadent monument to excess, say aye!

15:37.235 --> 15:38.352
Aye!

15:39.485 --> 15:40.693
Nay.

15:41.365 --> 15:43.530
I know it's not
your fault, Muk Mu.

15:43.536 --> 15:45.583
You're a gentle,
loving soul.

15:58.477 --> 16:00.270
What's wrong with
your bees, Lisa?

16:00.275 --> 16:02.392
Mr. Burns took away
their sanctuary,

16:02.396 --> 16:05.330
and now, they aren't strong enough
to survive on their own.

16:07.618 --> 16:08.911
I'm going home.

16:08.915 --> 16:10.903
Give me the keys
to my bike lock.

16:10.906 --> 16:12.951
- Are you sure?
- Give me the keys!

16:12.957 --> 16:13.993
Okay, okay!

16:13.998 --> 16:16.133
Don't know why
I had 'em in the first place.

16:20.086 --> 16:23.462
Oh, I'd do anything
to cheer up my little girl.

16:23.476 --> 16:24.510
Really?

16:24.788 --> 16:26.563
Listen, Homer,
in the back room,

16:26.566 --> 16:29.030
I got these super-tough
Africanized bees.

16:29.038 --> 16:31.362
I saw this ad
in a gentleman's magazine

16:31.368 --> 16:33.983
for excited African honeys,
and that's what they sent me.

16:33.987 --> 16:36.203
If we could combine them
with Lisa's bees,

16:36.205 --> 16:39.102
it would make them strong enough
to survive any environment.

16:39.105 --> 16:41.440
But how are we supposed
to combine the DNA

16:41.448 --> 16:43.880
of two strains
of the same species?

16:43.888 --> 16:45.313
Actually, Homer...

16:48.618 --> 16:50.591
You and me?

16:50.596 --> 16:52.863
- No, the bees!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:52.866 --> 16:56.112
That's what I meant, too.
I have no...

16:56.335 --> 16:58.063
inclination...

16:59.155 --> 17:00.580
- Got the queen?
- Yup.

17:00.598 --> 17:03.151
And she's ready for a night
of anonymous sex

17:03.158 --> 17:04.871
with multiple partners.

17:08.708 --> 17:11.622
Now, let's give them
some privacy while they...

17:11.627 --> 17:14.580
get down to buzziness.

17:14.588 --> 17:17.592
<i>Come with me</i>

17:17.597 --> 17:20.011
<i>My love</i>

17:21.355 --> 17:22.963
<i>To the sea</i>

17:23.244 --> 17:25.502
<i>The sea of love...</i>

17:25.517 --> 17:27.442
If they was me,
they'd be done by now.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.403
Wow.
This must be important, Dad!

17:35.405 --> 17:38.310
I've never seen you walk up
an incline before.

17:38.318 --> 17:41.461
Sweetie, I have a very
special surprise for you.

17:41.466 --> 17:42.980
My bees?!

17:44.046 --> 17:46.610
Your bees died days ago.

17:46.616 --> 17:49.103
These are their angry,
mutant descendants.

17:49.115 --> 17:52.331
And they're tough enough
to live in any environment.

17:52.338 --> 17:55.143
They sound awfully mad.
Are they dangerous?

17:55.148 --> 17:56.971
Hmm, I'm not sure.
Let me check.

17:56.975 --> 17:58.951
Are you guys dangerous?
Ooh!

17:59.175 --> 18:01.940
A simple yes
would have sufficed.

18:03.348 --> 18:05.950
Don't worry, Lisa.
Where else are they gonna go?

18:08.077 --> 18:11.530
To that new stadium that
looks exactly like a hive.

18:15.378 --> 18:17.850
Welcome to the American dream...

18:17.856 --> 18:20.702
a billionaire using public
funds to construct

18:20.705 --> 18:23.952
a private playground
for the rich and powerful.

18:25.926 --> 18:29.572
And now, so our skybox owners
can really enjoy the game,

18:29.577 --> 18:32.341
I shall let in the sky!

18:36.127 --> 18:38.383
Stop!
I am one of you!

18:43.375 --> 18:46.302
We've been invaded
by a swarm of killer bees!

18:46.318 --> 18:48.311
My microphone is
no microphone at all.

18:48.318 --> 18:51.052
It's bees!
Am I being badly stung?

18:51.055 --> 18:53.023
Yes!
And it hurts!

19:10.197 --> 19:12.061
Our bullets are useless.

19:12.065 --> 19:14.703
Aah!
Okay, they're useful on me.

19:20.348 --> 19:22.632
Oh, they've found a home.

19:23.566 --> 19:25.341
You've won this round,

19:25.346 --> 19:26.832
but when next we meet,

19:26.846 --> 19:30.640
the beekeeper
will be the beekeepee!

19:35.756 --> 19:37.472
Help me, Muk Mu!

19:42.286 --> 19:46.881
So, that's how I was outfoxed by a
little girl and her half-wit companion

19:46.887 --> 19:49.793
when my beautiful stadium
was declared a bee sanctuary,

19:49.795 --> 19:53.180
and I had to take a third-quarter
write down of $804 million.

19:53.198 --> 19:56.243
Wait a minute.
Someone crunch the numbers!

19:56.575 --> 19:58.292
He's only worth...

19:58.305 --> 20:02.741
$996,036,000.

20:02.748 --> 20:04.553
He's not a billionaire at all!

20:04.555 --> 20:05.533
Wait, wait, wait.

20:05.546 --> 20:08.463
It's only a matter of four million.
I'm sure I can find that somewhere.

20:08.467 --> 20:11.350
I, uh... I have $50 here
in my wallet.

20:12.476 --> 20:15.983
Mark, can you get me off
the hook for old times' sake?

20:15.985 --> 20:17.630
Can't do it, Monty.

20:19.926 --> 20:21.383
Aw, don't worry.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.241
You'll feel a lot
more comfortable in the...

20:24.247 --> 20:26.503
millionaires' camp.

20:26.507 --> 20:29.280
No! No!
Just kill me now!

20:32.337 --> 20:33.562
Howdy do?

20:33.568 --> 20:36.661
I own a minor
league hockey team.
