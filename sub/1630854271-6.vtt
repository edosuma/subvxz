Yes! You did it!

37:17.028 --> 37:20.365
Hello. What is your name
and where are you from?

37:20.407 --> 37:21.783
I'm Grace Bello.

37:21.825 --> 37:24.703
I'm 21 years old,
originally from Cibolo, Texas,

37:24.744 --> 37:26.663
but I just moved
to Lacey, Washington.

37:26.705 --> 37:29.040
Amazing.
Ooh.

37:29.082 --> 37:32.002
It was amazing,
because so many times

37:32.043 --> 37:34.129
we'll get singers
with these big,

37:34.170 --> 37:37.048
huge voices on the show,
and they do really well.

37:37.090 --> 37:41.469
But we've also had those singers
that were way more subtle,

37:41.511 --> 37:43.179
and I actually won
with a singer like that

37:43.221 --> 37:44.347
in my first season here.

37:44.389 --> 37:45.557
Her name was Maelyn,

37:45.598 --> 37:47.100
and I heard that
in you as well.

37:47.142 --> 37:50.979
You just have so much control,
and your tone is so beautiful.

37:51.021 --> 37:52.814
Do you play
any instruments?

37:52.856 --> 37:54.149
I'm learning the keyboard.

37:54.190 --> 37:56.443
I've played a little keyboard
in my day.

37:56.484 --> 37:57.986
[ Laughter ]
Yeah.

37:58.028 --> 38:00.613
I think we could make some
beautiful music on this show,

38:00.655 --> 38:04.534
and I would love
to coach you.
Thank you.

38:04.576 --> 38:06.494
It's really rare
that somebody will show

38:06.536 --> 38:07.954
that many sides
of their voice,

38:07.996 --> 38:10.081
or that they even have
that many sides to their voice.

38:10.123 --> 38:12.167
And you were able to get tender
with your voice

38:12.208 --> 38:14.961
and really listen to the lyrics
of what you're saying,

38:15.003 --> 38:17.047
and that's also rare
for someone so young.

38:17.088 --> 38:18.757
And I think that
you would fit in

38:18.798 --> 38:20.675
really, really good
on Team Gwen.

38:20.717 --> 38:22.802
And there really isn't
anybody on my team that can

38:22.844 --> 38:24.888
do runs the way
that you do.
Yeah.

38:24.929 --> 38:26.473
Like, there's nobody
like you on my team.

38:26.514 --> 38:27.474
"Yeah."

38:27.515 --> 38:28.475
So --
[ Laughter ]

38:28.516 --> 38:29.976
What?

38:30.018 --> 38:30.977
[ Laughs ]

38:31.019 --> 38:33.396
Anyways,
I would love to coach you.

38:33.438 --> 38:34.564
Thank you.

38:34.606 --> 38:36.358
Hey, Grace!
Hi, Camila!

38:36.399 --> 38:39.694
I was like, "Ooh, she's singing
a Justin Bieber song..."
Mm-hmm.

38:39.736 --> 38:42.822
"...so I'm guessing that
she likes pop music."

38:42.864 --> 38:44.657
I do.
I would be really excited

38:44.699 --> 38:47.369
to explore song choices
with you.

38:47.410 --> 38:48.578
And I love
Justin Bieber!

38:48.620 --> 38:50.914
Yeah, and I love
Justin Bieber, too,

38:50.955 --> 38:52.082
and Blake didn't know --
You didn't even know.

38:52.123 --> 38:53.875
I was the one
that told you!

38:53.917 --> 38:55.627
Oh, my God. He <i>is</i>a liar.
What are you talking about?

38:55.669 --> 38:58.171
Eh, Blake would never lie.
You go "Justin Bieber?"
I go, "Yeah."

38:58.213 --> 39:00.548
I was the one
who said Justin Bieber.
She asked if it was
Justin Bieber, and I said yes.

39:00.590 --> 39:02.008
Not true.
[ Laughter ]

39:02.050 --> 39:03.426
But anyway, I thought that
when you went into

39:03.468 --> 39:04.969
your belting tone,
I was like,

39:05.011 --> 39:07.180
"Ooh, I hear a little bit
of like Ariana in there."

39:07.222 --> 39:09.516
Well, I am Sicilian and I know
she's Italian, so --

39:09.557 --> 39:11.518
I'm Italian.
Okay.

39:11.559 --> 39:12.852
I got married in Italy.

39:12.894 --> 39:14.437
I'm also Cuban, Camila, so --
You are Cuban?

39:14.479 --> 39:15.855
I am Cuban.
That's awesome.

39:15.897 --> 39:19.234
I don't have a clue what I am.
Maybe Italian.

39:19.275 --> 39:21.569
Name three Justin Bieber songs
right now.

39:21.611 --> 39:22.987
[ Laughs ]
That's great.

39:23.029 --> 39:25.615
Uh, "MMMBop"?

39:25.657 --> 39:27.158
Is that...?
It's not Justin Bieber.

39:27.200 --> 39:29.285
Uh, Grace,
I really feel like,

39:29.327 --> 39:31.413
to say it's
slipping away from me,

39:31.454 --> 39:33.998
this opportunity,
might be an understatement.

39:34.040 --> 39:36.793
I won't give up.
Your voice is magical.

39:36.835 --> 39:39.045
Maybe I don't know
that much pop music,

39:39.087 --> 39:40.922
but it doesn't mean
that I'm not a fan.

39:40.964 --> 39:42.924
I would just represent you
as somebody who's

39:42.966 --> 39:44.759
done this now
for a long time,

39:44.801 --> 39:46.094
and I can't think of
anything

39:46.136 --> 39:49.764
that would be more
different and weird

39:49.806 --> 39:53.018
than if you chose me
as your coach.
Than you.

39:53.059 --> 39:55.311
Because I feel like an artist
like you, you need --

39:55.353 --> 39:56.938
A kook.

39:56.980 --> 39:57.939
Yeah.

39:57.981 --> 39:59.399
I'd love to be
your coach, Grace.

39:59.441 --> 40:00.775
Thank you.
Let's do this.

and any of the other coaches...

to show you...

the right jacket!

40:19.544 --> 40:21.921
Grace, this is
the real jacket.

no other names on it.

"Camila is a legend."

because it has more words.

one word.
