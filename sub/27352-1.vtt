09:16.389 --> 09:17.805
So I think it was last year,

09:17.807 --> 09:19.473
but it could have
been two years ago.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.224
But there was a huge
problem in China

09:21.226 --> 09:23.353
with the watermelon supply.

09:23.355 --> 09:29.400
Basically watermelons started
spontaneously combusting.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.526
So because of that there
was a huge shortage,

09:31.528 --> 09:33.820
and like the cost of
melons went up.

09:33.822 --> 09:37.074
But that's the reason that I
don't eat Chinese fruit.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.868
I basically try to stay away
from things

09:38.870 --> 09:40.080
that blow up on their own.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.123
China is amazing.

09:44.125 --> 09:48.085
I don't like watermelons anyhow,
so it's fine with me.

09:48.087 --> 09:52.757
When I was in the United States,
I was, uh, I was...

09:52.759 --> 09:54.425
...just everything, everything

09:54.427 --> 09:56.426
wasn't working out
too well for me.

09:56.428 --> 09:58.930
And basically, for somebody
without a

09:58.932 --> 09:59.930
proper college education,

09:59.932 --> 10:01.848
Or all the fucking paperwork
or whatever...

10:01.850 --> 10:03.434
the fact that I'm a genius

10:03.436 --> 10:04.810
really didn't make a difference

10:04.812 --> 10:06.188
uh, when I was trying
to get a job.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.985
And I was thinking,

10:11.568 --> 10:13.151
"How could I kill myself?"

10:13.153 --> 10:14.653
Like, "How could
I actually do it?"

10:14.655 --> 10:15.988
Like, I didn't want to
kill myself,

10:15.990 --> 10:17.699
I wanted something to kill me.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.367
Just happened to be

10:19.369 --> 10:20.951
in the middle of the road
at 2 in the morning...

10:20.953 --> 10:22.994
uh, wearing black,
something like that.

10:22.996 --> 10:24.454
And right then,

10:24.456 --> 10:25.706
I got a call from my friend.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.208
And my friend

10:27.210 --> 10:29.963
offered me a chance to come to,
come to China.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.254
What was he doing?

10:32.256 --> 10:40.722
iPhone? Fake iPhone 3G?

10:40.724 --> 10:43.432
Yeah, this is Jimmy Van Horn?

10:43.434 --> 10:45.600
of Big Horn Global?

10:45.602 --> 10:47.770
Yeah, I just wanted
to follow up.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.354
We talked prior in an email
about...

10:49.356 --> 10:51.898
Remember Spesh hooked me up

10:51.900 --> 10:53.818
...and he said he got
your info through

10:53.820 --> 10:56.070
Johnny Mai Thai? And uh...

10:56.072 --> 10:58.864
Uh, no, I have everything
here now.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.658
We've gone through
the R&D phase,

11:01.660 --> 11:03.578
We've relocated our
company to China.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.289
There was not a lot of
information about it before,

11:06.291 --> 11:09.959
But for proprietary reasons, I,
uh, you know...

11:09.961 --> 11:12.878
...wanted to reveal it in a,
uh... bread crumb

11:12.880 --> 11:15.297
...trail method, that uh,
as I referred to it.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.882
You're actually developing it
in China,

11:16.884 --> 11:19.761
...like, you're trying to get it
manufactured in China?

11:19.763 --> 11:22.220
and I just moved over here, and
then the other...

11:22.222 --> 11:23.805
But... you have a prototype?

11:23.807 --> 11:24.848
Yeah, yeah. I have two
prototypes.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.684
And you have the design?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.478
Right. I have a basic design, I have
more of a functional prototype...

11:29.480 --> 11:35.195
Then in the spiritual world, that there
are products that, that, you know...

11:35.903 --> 11:37.027
But I think at that point

11:37.029 --> 11:39.405
you have to work
with like, priests and shamans..

11:39.407 --> 11:41.366
...and that sort of thing,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.868
...to get them to the point that they
can start manifesting physical reality.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.036
Before you can go
to the next step,

11:45.038 --> 11:46.621
which is trying to market that.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.205
If you really want to make
money,

11:48.207 --> 11:49.791
there's other opportunities.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.792
Literally, if you walk
down the street,

11:51.794 --> 11:54.338
it would be almost impossible to
not make money...

11:54.839 --> 11:57.339
...if you have $20,000
that you want to invest.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.550
For online purposes,
it would open..

12:00.552 --> 12:04.137
By connecting... until we can connect
with them, we don't know what they need.

12:04.139 --> 12:07.099
Because I mean, it's the same thing...
I can do it a cheaper way...

12:07.101 --> 12:08.850
Because you could go to Africa,
right?

12:08.852 --> 12:10.728
And you could set them up on
the Internet, too, right?

12:10.730 --> 12:13.815
Get a big factory, and then just load
it full of laptops, cheap laptops...

12:13.817 --> 12:15.273
And have everybody
looking online.

12:15.275 --> 12:16.441
It's about the same value,

12:16.443 --> 12:18.151
because the people
that are looking

12:18.153 --> 12:20.445
are obviously not going to buy
a product or service.

12:20.447 --> 12:23.449
So it's the same as if you
have dead people.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.243
So it would be actually cheaper

12:25.245 --> 12:27.829
just to go to Africa
and set that up.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.539
And I have a friend in Africa

12:29.541 --> 12:32.791
that can help set that up for
you if you want to do that.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.960
Uh, this area here
is my favorite,

12:34.962 --> 12:37.714
because there's less
white people.

12:37.716 --> 12:38.964
So I mean, why come to China?

12:38.966 --> 12:40.590
And you'll say like, "Oh, I'm
from America."

12:40.592 --> 12:42.719
They say, "Oh, no no no, we have
a contract with America."

I've got people to do that for
me, you know?

13:04.743 --> 13:06.324
So it's not about buying, like,
this one piece.

200,000 pieces.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.954

13:09.956 --> 13:11.124
Know what I mean?

13:11.750 --> 13:13.833
You don't want your shit to get
ripped off, right?

13:13.835 --> 13:15.003
You don't do everything in the
same place.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.960
Because nobody knows what the
fuck they're building.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.503

trust them?

14:30.828 --> 14:32.286

14:34.499 --> 14:35.915
that we're dealing with.

that is one...

15:00.482 --> 15:03.694
Um, there are multiple

15:04.070 --> 15:06.903
and one agitator.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.866
And violator, um...

15:09.408 --> 15:11.700
So we have that in place.

But let me just say, it's a
high-stakes influencer.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.782
Yeah, we know Bob.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.283

out here...

16:37.163 --> 16:38.787

16:38.789 --> 16:40.248
if I wasn't willing to put it on
the line...

16:40.250 --> 16:41.373
...if I wasn't willing to put
my own money

16:41.375 --> 16:42.499
into the R&D.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.042
I know you put your money
where your mouth is.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.713
...for a product where it hasn't
been imagined yet. And so...

16:46.715 --> 16:48.046
I've got to foresee
in the future

16:48.048 --> 16:50.009
that this is something
that is viable.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.551
But I gotta put it in
to a package.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.429
We've got to sell
the whole thing.

16:54.431 --> 16:57.223
We can't, I can't pitch them
just one thing.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.975
We've got to pitch them a
whole ton of things.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.228
Well yeah. I'm going to...
and here's the thing.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.313
It took me two years to
get where I'm at

17:04.315 --> 17:08.191
And I am at a substantially
excellent place right now.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.986

17:09.988 --> 17:11.445
I'm going to fast track you in.

This one party,

17:13.324 --> 17:15.449
you're going to meet 100 of the
most influential

17:15.451 --> 17:17.868
12 year old billionaires
in China.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.286
We're going to pitch
our products.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.122
They don't even
care if they work.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.123
Let me tell you something.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.083
There are three rules in China:

17:24.085 --> 17:27.210
...be young and youthful, and
totally interesting.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.212
Don't be an old
curmudgeon shit bag.

17:29.214 --> 17:35.803
Don't fall in love with a
beautiful hooker.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.555
Thank you, nice to meet you all.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.640
I'm just so glad that all of you
can meet.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.978
This is a very
auspicious moment.

17:46.607 --> 17:54.654
I've been here 11 years and
eaten a lot of heads.

out into the world?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.925
And they feel so good!

18:14.885 --> 18:16.719
I'm wearing them right now and
they feel

18:16.721 --> 18:18.470
incredibly natural to me.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.764
- Wow.
- Mmhm.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.057
We've already got a million
dollars invested.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.267
We're wondering if you'd be

18:23.269 --> 18:25.018
willing to come in for that
second million

18:25.020 --> 18:26.228
as a joust.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.106
A jouster.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.274
OK. I think, I think we can
handle that.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.234
Fantastic.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.067
Yeah.

18:32.069 --> 18:32.943
Fantastic.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.403

Jimmy! Jimmy!

19:28.167 --> 19:30.709
Can you tell us a joke?

19:30.711 --> 19:32.461
Yeah. I used to give a
Japanese speech.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.130
At the end of the speech, I say,

19:34.132 --> 19:35.006
"Thank you very much."

19:35.008 --> 19:36.173
And the teacher say,

19:36.175 --> 19:37.549
"No, you should say in
Japanese."

19:37.551 --> 19:38.884
So I come again,

19:38.886 --> 19:40.344
"Sank you very much-ie"

Can you hear another joke?

19:46.978 --> 19:48.769
Please! Please!

19:48.771 --> 19:49.937
It was very hard for
me to grow up,

19:49.939 --> 19:51.939
because my mom loves me...

19:51.941 --> 19:53.735
...and she beats me a lot.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.777
And when my grandma
look at this,

19:56.779 --> 19:58.363
she would say, "Stop it!"

19:58.365 --> 20:00.782
"My turn!"

20:00.784 --> 20:02.533
"Stop it! My turn!"

21:17.902 --> 21:22.113
Q-zone, and then 0 on zingot?

21:22.115 --> 21:23.698
So that's just the
breakdown in there.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.782
So let me just show you where,

21:24.784 --> 21:26.534
of what, that little bit...

21:26.536 --> 21:27.910
Now you take that, you multiply
it exponentially

21:27.912 --> 21:30.121
once we create these
communications.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.081
The way we do it is with a
couple interfaces.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.415
One is a portable device.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.834
Using EMF frequency,

21:34.836 --> 21:36.126
electromagnetic frequency,

21:36.128 --> 21:37.628
...that is the tracking unit

21:37.630 --> 21:39.463
by which we are able to measure

21:39.465 --> 21:41.425
the presence of a ghost.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.259
And then this helps port

21:44.261 --> 21:46.804
between spiritual
and material world.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.805
...port connectivity.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.640
I'm sure everyone
has a dead grandparent

21:49.642 --> 21:51.144
that they want to talk to.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.438
I can communicate with my
grandmother?

21:54.064 --> 21:55.063
Finally.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.564
With this one?

21:56.566 --> 21:57.899
Yeah, yeah.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.484
If she wants to
communicate with you.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.695
Fantastic.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.446
If you know, if your one
company could

22:03.448 --> 22:04.654
produce the electronics,

22:04.656 --> 22:06.157
...the other company could
produce the plastic.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.449
Um...

22:07.451 --> 22:08.286
We did.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.495
You could? You could?

22:10.497 --> 22:11.746
Because there's a lot of
opportunities.

22:11.748 --> 22:12.749
Yeah.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.750
And then, I think we can upgrade

22:16.752 --> 22:18.878
the materials of those ones.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.255
Looks beautiful, looks good.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.715
Of the outside.

22:22.717 --> 22:23.718
I love it.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.430
I think I need to take
some picture?

22:27.931 --> 22:30.055
Do any other research?

22:30.057 --> 22:31.474
Uh, that sounds great!

22:31.476 --> 22:32.975
Yeah. I think this better.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.352

mind?

sure the size is OK.

results.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.681
So 2 or 3 prototypes, I think?

26:40.683 --> 26:41.724
Is better.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.017
Yeah.

can't do the colors.

29:54.752 --> 29:56.960

I'm going to turn your $40k
into $2 million dollars.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.007
I'm being smart
about revealing it,

30:02.009 --> 30:03.968
so just... if you don't mind,

30:03.970 --> 30:05.930
Oh, I'm not going to tell
anybody shit!

30:10.894 --> 30:13.227
We're 600 miles from the
epicenter of this

30:13.229 --> 30:15.105
factory, in Mongolia.

30:15.606 --> 30:18.106
It's just emitting plumes and
plumes of smoke.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.401
But that smoke is comprised of

30:20.403 --> 30:23.403
billions of little
smartdust cells.

30:23.405 --> 30:25.323
It's a microprocessor,

30:25.325 --> 30:27.410
but on the subatomic level.

30:27.911 --> 30:28.992
But you get used to it.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.495

30:42.342 --> 30:43.966
So this happened a
little while ago

30:43.968 --> 30:45.220
in the north of China.

30:46.637 --> 30:48.554
And, just out of nowhere,

30:48.556 --> 30:54.017
this huge population of giant
gerbils just appeared.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.062
Not just like regular gerbils,

30:56.064 --> 30:59.356
but giant
fucking crazy Chinese gerbils.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.651
They started devouring the
landscape,

31:01.653 --> 31:03.863
just eating everything
in their path.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.698
So what they did is
they started a

31:06.700 --> 31:08.492
breeding farm of eagles.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.994
They, I mean, to get them to
just go faster

31:11.996 --> 31:14.663
they were using growth
hormones...

31:14.665 --> 31:17.040
...and crazy shit.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.959
And they had trained them to

31:18.961 --> 31:20.838
go after gerbils.

31:21.423 --> 31:23.131
What they didn't
count on was how

31:23.133 --> 31:26.217
ferocious these
fucking gerbils were.

31:26.219 --> 31:29.180
And in the end the gerbils won.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.641
Just slaughtered the eagles.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.807
And so the Chinese,

31:33.809 --> 31:36.980
as determined as they are,
they found another solution.

31:37.439 --> 31:39.229
And what it ended
up being is that

31:39.231 --> 31:41.940
in the US, at the same time...

31:41.942 --> 31:44.901
...assisted suicide
was becoming a thing.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.155
I mean, it was becoming legal.

31:54.079 --> 31:54.913
WoonSen?

32:02.713 --> 32:06.342
Life on earth is
beautiful and short.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.760
What happens after we die?

32:09.762 --> 32:11.930
The usefulness of a window is
not in the frame

32:12.557 --> 32:14.974
but in the empty space that
lets the light through.

32:14.976 --> 32:18.143
The usefulness of a cup is
not merely in the clay

32:18.145 --> 32:20.315
but in the empty space
that holds the coffee.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.065
Nothing is something.

32:23.067 --> 32:26.028
Like trying to be somebody
is being nobody.

32:26.488 --> 32:28.112
And vice versa.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.780
Introducing Ghoster,

32:29.782 --> 32:40.123
the world's first transdimensional
communication device.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.794
So at the same time, in the US

32:42.796 --> 32:45.462
suicide was becoming
kind of fashionable.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.507
It was becoming legal.

32:47.509 --> 32:50.051
And so a Chinese company

32:50.053 --> 32:53.136
had come up with a cyanide pill

32:53.138 --> 32:55.347
like pre-packaged, ready-to-go,

32:55.349 --> 32:57.683
and it had a US flag on it.

32:57.685 --> 33:02.771
And the issue was when it got to
the US customs authorities

33:02.773 --> 33:04.399
they said, you know...

33:04.401 --> 33:06.150
...it just, that wasn't
going to happen.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.988
So they had sent the whole
shipment back.

33:10.155 --> 33:10.988
So the Chinese

33:10.990 --> 33:12.741
used this to their advantage

33:13.117 --> 33:18.330
and they loaded up planes packed
with these cyanide pills.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.415
And they laid them out

33:21.417 --> 33:23.711
over the wasteland.

33:24.128 --> 33:25.711
But at this point,

33:25.713 --> 33:29.134
the gerbils had already consumed
everything in their area.

33:29.592 --> 33:31.133
And they were moving south.

33:31.135 --> 33:33.094
For the cities.

33:33.096 --> 33:35.932
And so now, in the north of
China,

33:36.432 --> 33:39.728
there's a strip of land
60 miles wide

33:39.978 --> 33:41.393
...and a thousand miles long,

33:41.395 --> 33:45.523
just littered with these
little cyanide pills

33:45.525 --> 33:52.738
with the US flag on them.

33:52.740 --> 33:58.036
Do you pay your taxes?

33:58.038 --> 34:01.124
And I mean, the gerbils are
still out there

34:02.125 --> 34:03.751
it's still an issue.

34:04.626 --> 34:08.670
They're just devouring
everything.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.213
There's still people trying to
figure out

34:10.215 --> 34:12.469
where they even came from.

34:58.306 --> 35:00.222
Quite dangerous with
animals or people?

35:00.224 --> 35:02.182
Animals or people?

35:02.184 --> 35:03.184
Both?

35:03.186 --> 35:04.184
Both. Yeah.

35:04.186 --> 35:05.188
What kind of animals?

35:05.521 --> 35:07.604
The pig, I think the wild pig.

35:07.606 --> 35:08.438
Oh, wild pig?

35:08.440 --> 35:09.273
Yeah.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.110
Really?

35:15.447 --> 35:16.449
Ah, okay.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.951

35:19.827 --> 35:21.702

going to be there?

36:58.385 --> 36:59.217

37:00.177 --> 37:01.385

definitely coming.

48:16.813 --> 48:18.186
You... paid for that.

48:18.188 --> 48:21.106
No, Bob said you
had that covered.

48:21.108 --> 48:22.108
Fuck your bitcoin.

48:22.110 --> 48:24.068
Your 40,000 didn't
even cover security.

48:24.070 --> 48:26.320
You had 200 Russian
models there.

48:26.322 --> 48:28.322
I didn't ask for
200 Russian models!

48:28.324 --> 48:30.742
You don't throw a party for
triad investors

48:30.744 --> 48:32.909
without 200 Russian
models, you idiot.

48:32.911 --> 48:34.704
There weren't any investors there.
I didn't, I didn't see any.

48:34.706 --> 48:35.954
You were put in front of them.

48:35.956 --> 48:37.875
You know what you did with that?
You fucked it!

48:38.626 --> 48:40.461
I think what Donny is trying
to say is

48:40.836 --> 48:48.008
the optics were extremely bad.

48:48.010 --> 48:51.429
That was all the money I had,
I put everything into that.

48:51.431 --> 48:54.014
I did everything I was asked to
do leading into it.

48:54.016 --> 48:56.018
And you seemed fine with that at
the time and now you're...

49:00.065 --> 49:01.646
What are we getting at?

49:01.648 --> 49:07.279
Are, are you guys... are you guys
not interested in Ghostr anymore?

49:09.449 --> 49:10.947
To be honest,

49:10.949 --> 49:13.077
I didn't realize until just now
you were serious about it.

49:13.536 --> 49:14.537
I assumed it was fake.

49:17.373 --> 49:19.792
Like all of Bob's products.

49:21.126 --> 49:22.503
I don't...

49:22.795 --> 49:25.128
need you vamping me out and
thinking you're the man

49:25.130 --> 49:28.090
because you're the first monies
in, alright?

49:28.092 --> 49:29.342
We have a long history

49:29.344 --> 49:31.177
and I've put a lot of trust in
you with this,

49:31.179 --> 49:33.597
and I need you to follow
through.

49:34.014 --> 49:35.139
If something happened to you,

49:35.141 --> 49:39.017
I hope you're doing okay
and I apologize.

49:39.019 --> 49:41.815
But there is a lot
at stake here.

49:45.193 --> 49:46.569
I'm on standby.

49:50.155 --> 49:53.407
Now more than 17 million dollars
worth of bitcoin,

49:53.409 --> 49:56.536
the online digital currency,
has been stolen

49:56.538 --> 49:59.037
in the 2nd largest
hack of its kind.

49:59.039 --> 50:01.374
Hong Kong based bitcoin
exchange, BitFinex

50:01.376 --> 50:03.166
said it has suspended
trading after a

50:03.168 --> 50:06.503
security breach where
120,000 bitcoin

50:06.505 --> 50:09.840
have been stolen from the
platform globally.

50:09.842 --> 50:13.762
And looking at how the digital
currency is managed, over 20%...

51:02.561 --> 51:06.481
Bob, Ghostr's been
CTRL-C'd in Wahshanbei,

51:06.483 --> 51:09.691
it must have been brain drained
between phase 1 and 2.

51:09.693 --> 51:12.028
This is like the 5th message
I have left for you.

51:12.030 --> 51:13.862
I just called Tax Ninja

51:13.864 --> 51:15.782
and he didn't even know where
you were.

51:15.784 --> 51:17.617
It's hitting the
critical point now.

51:17.619 --> 51:18.867
I have nothing left.

51:18.869 --> 51:21.204
I need your help on this,

51:21.206 --> 51:24.668
because I'm not going to last long
if I don't get this worked out.

51:46.648 --> 51:47.729
Calm down.

51:47.731 --> 51:49.315
How did you know
it was knocked off.

51:49.317 --> 51:51.108
It's not a very unique box.

51:51.110 --> 51:53.235
I'm positive. I don't
know what else...

51:53.237 --> 51:55.112
there's no other way.

51:55.114 --> 51:56.490
No, you're not sure.

51:57.074 --> 51:59.325
Who did you give
the design file to?

51:59.327 --> 52:01.327
Bob. Well, Bob saw it because
he's been walking me

52:01.329 --> 52:04.746
through the whole process, and
then at the dinner...

52:04.748 --> 52:08.918
Whoah whoah whoah.
What do you mean dinner?

52:08.920 --> 52:10.961
Yeah, but there was
no other way...

52:10.963 --> 52:15.258
that was the only way to get introduced
to Vincent, through the dinner.

52:15.260 --> 52:17.262
Do you have enough money for a
hotel, or...

52:17.762 --> 52:19.302
where you at for money?

52:19.304 --> 52:21.472
I've been doing everything out
of the Bighorn Global account

52:21.474 --> 52:22.764
and it's pretty much drained.

52:22.766 --> 52:25.476
You want me to
make some calls?

52:25.478 --> 52:27.269
If you can get a hold of Bob I'd
appreciate it,

52:27.271 --> 52:29.313
if you could get a
hold of Vincent.

52:29.315 --> 52:32.191
I, everyone has iced me out
right now.

52:32.193 --> 52:33.735
Alright. Hang tight.

52:33.737 --> 52:37.572
Let me make some phone calls and
I'll get right back to you.

52:37.574 --> 52:39.909
Get back to me soon, though.

52:45.789 --> 52:47.706
I was in the metro

52:47.708 --> 52:51.337
and it was really hot
and sweaty day.

52:52.380 --> 52:56.298
This guy just grabbed my shirt
and sneezed into my shirt.

52:56.300 --> 52:57.675
And he just looked at me like,

52:57.677 --> 52:59.760
"Yup, I just sneezed, I just
sneezed on your shirt."

52:59.762 --> 53:02.889
And we had to sit there,
standing next to each other,

53:02.891 --> 53:04.474
like just staring at each other
face to face,

53:04.476 --> 53:07.351
like 3 inches away
from his face.

53:07.353 --> 53:10.354
Just for like 15 minutes
until we got to the next stop.

53:10.356 --> 53:11.608
He just didn't care.

53:12.733 --> 53:14.983
But didn't that guy end up
becoming your best friend?

53:14.985 --> 53:17.154
The guy who sneezed
on your shirt?

53:18.322 --> 53:21.492
You said you exchanged numbers,
became friends.

53:22.202 --> 53:24.329
He just can't stand human
beings,

53:25.204 --> 53:26.956
to which I can
totally relate to.

53:27.414 --> 53:31.291
And he had a factory of 500
people replaced to machinery.

53:31.293 --> 53:34.297
Didn't you tell me he fired all
of them except for one guy?

53:35.215 --> 53:36.338
Yeah, he walked me in

53:36.340 --> 53:37.967
and he showed me the guy's
office, it was empty.

53:38.717 --> 53:41.135
He looked down, he was really
depressed,

53:41.137 --> 53:43.179
"I couldn't get rid of him."

53:43.181 --> 53:45.307
"Because he's the guy that
makes the machines."

53:54.442 --> 53:57.610
Happens every year in China.

53:57.612 --> 53:59.989
Betrayal Season.

54:00.489 --> 54:03.365
It's kind of like Thanksgiving
for Americans or

54:03.367 --> 54:06.663
Christmas for the Irish.

54:07.204 --> 54:09.037
This is sweaty betrayal.

54:09.039 --> 54:10.875
Sweaty betrayal season.

54:24.389 --> 54:27.347
Everybody comes out to betray
you at the same time.

54:27.349 --> 54:29.018
It's a community effort.

54:29.893 --> 54:33.439
Don't know what causes it, but
it's areal thing.

54:34.356 --> 54:43.113
You will get fucked in July.

54:43.115 --> 54:45.700
Uh, so I'm a little preoccupied

54:45.702 --> 54:48.327
with pulling penises out of my
ass right now.

54:48.329 --> 54:49.664
Would you say that?

54:53.083 --> 54:54.499
So let's just get through
this phase,

54:54.501 --> 54:56.878
so I can get back to what I was
doing before,

54:56.880 --> 54:58.673
which is just fixing everything
for everybody.

55:00.132 --> 55:02.508
Is that what I said yesterday?

55:02.510 --> 55:04.260
You said it at some point.

55:04.262 --> 55:05.680
Then it's kind of classic.

55:08.307 --> 55:09.432
They're going to do a meeting
tomorrow.

55:09.434 --> 55:11.266
You want to go make some money?

55:11.268 --> 55:12.476
What's involved?

55:12.478 --> 55:15.396
Showing up, but I mean,
it's like really good,

55:15.398 --> 55:16.856
really good money.

55:16.858 --> 55:18.316
I'm talking to you about like
real money.

55:18.318 --> 55:19.650
No no, it's just that...

55:19.652 --> 55:21.235
And it's not like
fucking it off,

55:21.237 --> 55:22.528
because that would be fucking
massively destructive, right?

55:22.530 --> 55:23.780
No, no no no no, no...

55:23.782 --> 55:25.280
They're looking for Americans to
get involved?

55:25.282 --> 55:27.532
Well, they're looking for the
best people

55:27.534 --> 55:29.159
that they can find to get
involved. Right?

55:29.161 --> 55:32.287
And they have the money to back
it up, so you can take it...

55:32.289 --> 55:34.374
I've heard that, yeah.

55:34.376 --> 55:39.128
I mean, it's legitimate. It's
like a fucking meeting, you know?

55:39.130 --> 55:40.757
No, that's how... I mean...

55:41.507 --> 55:44.550
No, I mean, but yeah, just...

55:44.552 --> 55:48.512
No no, that's... I would,
that's super

55:48.514 --> 55:50.682
I like long-distance running,

55:50.684 --> 55:54.894
and swimming, and traveling,

55:54.896 --> 55:57.854
you know, to other countries and
other places.

55:57.856 --> 56:01.775
So that's what brought me here.

56:01.777 --> 56:05.948
You know, the desire to see
other things and other places.

56:07.992 --> 56:09.492
I moved here.

56:09.494 --> 56:11.454
So permanently, yeah. Yeah,
relocated.

56:21.422 --> 56:22.339
I do, I swim a lot.

56:24.342 --> 56:26.758
We have a pool party.

56:26.760 --> 56:28.554
Oh, pool party!
I would, yeah yeah...

56:33.434 --> 56:34.474
Yeah, anything you need.

56:34.476 --> 56:36.478
I'm ready to dive in.

56:37.438 --> 56:38.731
I will work my
fingers to the bone.

56:39.733 --> 56:41.733
So yeah, I have a lot of energy.
I have a lot of energy.

56:41.735 --> 56:44.028
Can I ask you a very
personal question?

56:47.865 --> 56:50.324
<font color="#FFD700">(LAUGHS)</font>

56:50.326 --> 56:52.784
I like girls. So yeah.

56:52.786 --> 56:53.952
Oh, you are straight.

56:53.954 --> 56:54.788
OK, yes.

56:59.753 --> 57:06.007
So we might want to change your
energetic cowboy look

57:06.009 --> 57:09.635
into a very energetic, maybe
sporty look.

57:09.637 --> 57:12.972
Maybe you know, slim fit,
polo shirts...

57:12.974 --> 57:14.724
Sneakers?

57:14.726 --> 57:19.729
Yeah, yeah. Very sunshiney and
sporty look to match their products

57:19.731 --> 57:23.483
Are you okay with it? Because
for marketing campaign,

57:23.485 --> 57:26.068
young people especially...

57:26.070 --> 57:27.820
Yeah, no I think that's good.

57:27.822 --> 57:29.280
They have product team,

57:29.282 --> 57:31.659
they have marketing team, and
marketing campaign,

57:32.034 --> 57:34.244
and also social medias.

57:34.661 --> 57:36.747
So they like international
faces.

58:08.780 --> 58:12.115
I had an idea for a crane!

58:12.117 --> 58:15.534
Just basically can work on four
buildings at once,

58:15.536 --> 58:21.708
it's like a quatro-crane? So
you can build

58:21.710 --> 58:22.708
this building over here...

58:22.710 --> 58:24.336
and this building here, here,
and here.

58:26.547 --> 58:29.465
We could quadruple
civilization in

58:29.467 --> 58:32.846
like, 25 years with that shit.

58:34.139 --> 58:37.222
You think that's a good idea?

58:37.224 --> 58:38.893
You like that idea?

58:44.733 --> 58:46.273
Hi!

58:46.275 --> 58:47.733
How you doing?

58:47.735 --> 58:48.608
Ready?

58:48.610 --> 58:50.903
Oh, I like this pink color.

58:50.905 --> 58:52.615
Yeah, wonderful.

59:07.172 --> 59:10.175
Can I see your teeth?
Smile, please?

59:10.592 --> 59:11.673
Smile?

59:11.675 --> 59:12.633
Yeah, yeah yeah.

59:12.635 --> 59:13.633
Ah, let me see.

59:13.635 --> 59:15.094
Oh, oh, no no no.

59:15.096 --> 59:16.554
uh listen

59:16.556 --> 59:18.639
So whenever you want to smile,

59:18.641 --> 59:20.769
just smile like this.

59:21.478 --> 59:22.851
Closed mouth?

59:22.853 --> 59:25.354
Yes! Oh, wonderful,
that's much better.

59:25.356 --> 59:26.773
You should tell
the story of "you"

59:26.775 --> 59:29.066
but without any words.

59:29.068 --> 59:30.735
Show exciting,

59:30.737 --> 59:32.778
but without any emotion.

59:32.780 --> 59:34.112
That's very important. Right?

59:34.114 --> 59:34.947
OK.

59:34.949 --> 59:35.865
Cool.

59:35.867 --> 59:36.701
I understand.

01:00:29.545 --> 01:00:30.795
This is what I normally do,

01:00:30.797 --> 01:00:34.382
this project I'm putting
together.

01:00:34.384 --> 01:00:36.467
No no no no no no no.

01:00:36.469 --> 01:00:38.221
No, he's fine.

01:00:50.775 --> 01:00:52.691
You are not here for social, OK?

01:00:52.693 --> 01:00:53.525
No no...

01:00:53.527 --> 01:00:55.028
Yeah, you understand?

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:56.031
I understand, this was after we
were done, so it was once we...

01:00:56.905 --> 01:00:58.780
You do your job, that's it.

01:00:58.782 --> 01:01:01.368
Remember. That's all for today.

01:01:01.994 --> 01:01:55.880
You can't do it, man. You just
can't do it.

01:01:55.882 --> 01:01:58.633
You guys have to look deep
within yourselves

01:01:58.635 --> 01:02:01.346
and realize we're all
part of the same ecosystem.

01:02:02.012 --> 01:02:03.970
Fear has two meanings:

01:02:03.972 --> 01:02:05.222
forget everything and run,

01:02:05.224 --> 01:02:07.141
or face everything and rise.

01:02:07.143 --> 01:02:08.019
The choice is yours.

01:02:17.528 --> 01:02:19.528
It's very easy to use, right?

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:20.364
It's very easy!

01:02:47.891 --> 01:02:50.144
Sell this shit. Don't play.

01:03:05.617 --> 01:03:07.746
What I'm doing?
What you told me to do!

01:03:10.914 --> 01:03:12.498
No, I'm doing everything you
want!

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.335
I'm letting everyone know!

01:03:31.853 --> 01:03:33.771
I thought you were fine-

01:03:57.461 --> 01:04:00.003
You've broken this shit, man.

01:04:00.005 --> 01:04:01.590
You've broken the fucking shit.

01:04:07.889 --> 01:04:12.057
I want to tell you that we hired
you for the hove board product

01:04:12.059 --> 01:04:15.186
because we thought you
are a product guy.

01:04:15.188 --> 01:04:17.938
And we expected you to...

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:21.818
we expected you to at least do
some introduction

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.945
of the functionality of the
product.

01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:26.363
Yes well, Carrie, then it is
your responsibility

01:04:26.365 --> 01:04:28.700
to give me the parameters which
within to work,

01:04:28.702 --> 01:04:30.284
so then I can thrive-

01:04:30.286 --> 01:04:33.204
with what this character is
supposed to deliver.

01:04:33.206 --> 01:04:34.831
I was under the impression

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:38.041
that all I was supposed to do
was smile and wave.

01:04:38.043 --> 01:04:40.253
Well, we're clear right now,
right?

01:04:40.255 --> 01:04:43.088
That's your job, it's not the
thing you should do,

01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:45.425
it's the thing that you have to
do, right?

01:04:45.427 --> 01:04:48.135
So I want you
to understand that.

01:04:48.137 --> 01:04:49.220
We don't get paid.

01:04:49.222 --> 01:04:51.514
If we don't get paid, you are
not getting paid.

01:04:51.516 --> 01:04:55.601
So we can still pay
you a KFC coupon...

01:04:55.603 --> 01:04:57.646
This isn't sustainable.

01:04:57.981 --> 01:04:59.983
I don't eat meat on bones.

01:05:29.346 --> 01:05:31.304
Here's what we're going to do.

01:05:31.306 --> 01:05:32.554
Please repeat.

01:05:32.556 --> 01:05:36.141
I, Jimmy, will take my dick out
of my ass...

01:05:36.143 --> 01:05:38.144
They have such particular
expectations

01:05:38.146 --> 01:05:40.521
of what you're wanting to get
out of this.

01:05:40.523 --> 01:05:43.566
I specifically managed this
meeting, because

01:05:43.568 --> 01:05:47.153
out of all of the homeless
foreigners in this country,

01:05:47.155 --> 01:05:50.113
you managed to be the only one
that looks like a cowboy.

01:05:50.115 --> 01:05:54.159
That's the only reason that you
got this opportunity.

01:05:54.161 --> 01:05:56.119
This isn't an opportunity!

01:05:56.121 --> 01:06:00.083
Peddling a bootleg Segway
isn't an opportunity!

01:06:00.085 --> 01:06:03.126
I'm an entrepreneur, Spesh.

01:06:03.128 --> 01:06:09.050
I need to talk to Johnny and
I need to talk to him now.

01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:11.346
Spesh?

01:06:17.184 --> 01:06:21.690
You know, you try to be nice.

01:06:24.733 --> 01:06:28.735
This is all been very very
friendly, very very nice.

01:06:28.737 --> 01:06:30.612
And then there's the threshold,

01:06:30.614 --> 01:06:34.201
and then over that it's just
satanic hatred...

01:06:36.954 --> 01:08:19.304
of everyone.

01:08:19.305 --> 01:08:24.268
No, no, that's mine!

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:25.268
But where was this made?

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:26.188
Because I designed it.

01:08:35.863 --> 01:08:36.990
Alright, how much is that?

01:08:39.452 --> 01:08:48.417
- $380?
- Yeah.

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.421
Will you give me 200?

01:10:06.372 --> 01:10:08.830
Look, just because I'm not
part of a particular ecosystem

01:10:08.832 --> 01:10:10.540
doesn't mean I can't
be fully integrated.

01:10:10.542 --> 01:10:12.795
Why can't you help
me get fully integrated?

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:15.045
Johnny's supposed to be
the lead on this,

01:10:15.047 --> 01:10:15.963
his name is on the term sheet.

01:10:15.965 --> 01:10:17.173
I've known that
guy my whole life.

01:10:17.175 --> 01:10:20.343
Why am I talking to you about
how to see him?

01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:23.262
Johnny Mai Thai doesn't
like to be disturbed,

01:10:23.264 --> 01:10:25.557
he really respects his privacy

01:10:26.475 --> 01:10:28.518
and he likes it when other
people follow suit.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.769
I can't get cut off from every
elite founder in China

01:10:30.771 --> 01:10:32.356
just because I flubbed a speech
at a Guanxi event...

01:10:35.609 --> 01:10:37.653
He's not responsible for anyone.

01:10:39.488 --> 01:10:40.322
None of us.

01:10:40.948 --> 01:10:42.865
Spesh, I need to see
Johnny Mai Thai,

01:10:42.867 --> 01:10:44.659
and I don't need you to be
an intermediary.

01:10:44.661 --> 01:10:46.576
This is crazy.

01:10:46.578 --> 01:10:48.995
I've known this guy my whole life, the
fact that he is the lead on this?

01:10:48.997 --> 01:10:51.206
I mean you can't even give me a
straight answer at this point?

01:10:51.208 --> 01:10:53.418
I can't be kept in
a vault like this.

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.503
The guy is intricately
invoked with this,

01:10:55.505 --> 01:10:56.504
why do I have to go through you?

01:10:56.506 --> 01:10:58.046
This is ridiculous.

01:10:58.048 --> 01:10:59.632
Why can't you just
give me his number

01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:00.633
and tell me where he is?

01:11:00.635 --> 01:11:03.177
You want to see Johnny Mai Thai?

01:11:03.179 --> 01:11:05.429
You really want to see
Johnny Mai Thai?

01:11:05.431 --> 01:11:07.016
I'll tell you exactly
where he is.

01:11:07.266 --> 01:11:09.892
About 1600 miles north of here,

01:11:09.894 --> 01:11:11.893
there's a brand new
city built to be

01:11:11.895 --> 01:11:13.981
the biggest city in the world,

01:11:14.565 --> 01:11:19.360
except it's totally empty,
only 25 people there.

01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:23.572
That means there's only 25
lights on at night.

01:11:23.574 --> 01:11:27.119
One of those lights is Johnny.

01:11:29.038 --> 01:11:31.248

I never saw a wild

dead from a bough

01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:27.472
without ever having
felt sorry for itself.

01:12:30.475 --> 01:12:34.143
I literally repeat that in my
head over and over and over,

01:12:34.145 --> 01:12:36.356
on repeat.

01:12:38.274 --> 01:12:40.066

People that will betray you.

actually work, right?

that you can visualize
people as trees

or people as rocks,

01:13:05.926 --> 01:13:09.970
where I can just
interact with people

01:13:09.972 --> 01:13:12.473
at the very moment that I need
to interact with them,

01:13:12.475 --> 01:13:14.892
then erase them from my memory,

01:13:14.894 --> 01:13:17.186
and erase them from
my thought processes,

be in Northern China

01:34:28.001 --> 01:34:30.462
Cousin Ronny from Cameron Parish

01:34:31.003 --> 01:34:32.836
This is Jimmy.

01:34:32.838 --> 01:34:33.754
My best friend.

01:34:33.756 --> 01:34:35.424
From Port Arthur.

01:34:35.841 --> 01:34:37.760
Go on and have a seat.

01:34:57.029 --> 01:35:06.454
What happened to your face?

01:35:06.456 --> 01:35:07.830
You ever get the one where

01:35:07.832 --> 01:35:09.456
a ghost flies through you,

01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:11.459
slaps your hand
down on your carrot

01:35:11.461 --> 01:35:12.460
fixes your car

01:35:12.462 --> 01:35:13.460
and tells you to date some woman

01:35:13.462 --> 01:35:14.879
and marry her

01:35:14.881 --> 01:35:18.924
and calls you a motherfucking
stupid fucking asshole

01:35:18.926 --> 01:35:22.887
bout every time you try to
pass a rearview mirror

01:35:22.889 --> 01:35:27.349
on your way to the motherfucking
cemetery, bruh?

01:35:27.351 --> 01:35:28.936
You ever get like that?

01:35:35.777 --> 01:35:37.112
No.

01:35:40.907 --> 01:35:44.075
Me, I guess I got one
of 'em real bad

01:35:44.077 --> 01:35:45.744
and now you're lookin' at it

01:36:01.136 --> 01:36:04.762
3000 years ago,
if you heard a voice

01:36:04.764 --> 01:36:06.888
that said kill your dog,

01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:08.518
kill your mama

01:36:09.978 --> 01:36:11.393
that wasn't a crazy voice,

01:36:11.395 --> 01:36:15.356
that was the voice of God

01:36:15.358 --> 01:36:17.110
and you obeyed it immediately

01:36:19.487 --> 01:36:21.614
and now you gotta ask yourself

01:36:22.907 --> 01:36:24.909
what voice are you listening to?

01:36:30.622 --> 01:36:32.080
I'm not a poet,

01:36:32.082 --> 01:36:32.916
I'm an entrepreneur.

01:36:50.435 --> 01:36:53.311
How'd it go with the...

01:36:53.313 --> 01:36:55.729
...the one that Father Regard
used to say

01:36:55.731 --> 01:36:57.317
at Thanksgiving mass?

01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:59.318
Ended up in your video, bruh.

01:37:02.447 --> 01:37:05.072
The usefulness of a cup is not
in the clay

01:37:05.074 --> 01:37:08.118
but in the empty space that
holds the coffee.

01:37:10.537 --> 01:37:13.790
The usefulness of a window
is not in the frame

01:37:13.792 --> 01:37:14.790
<font color="#FFD700">(BOTH)</font>
but in the empty space

01:37:14.792 --> 01:37:17.545
that lets the light through.

01:37:21.131 --> 01:37:23.758
Nothing is something.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:25.425
That's why trying to be somebody

01:37:25.427 --> 01:37:26.593
is trying to be nobody

01:37:26.595 --> 01:37:29.763
and vice versa.

01:37:29.765 --> 01:37:34.852
I call that message zero.

01:37:34.854 --> 01:37:39.857
Better start being
nobody prontissimo.

01:37:39.859 --> 01:37:42.235
Me I know what you went
through back home.

01:37:42.237 --> 01:37:44.986
I know what they did you

01:37:44.988 --> 01:37:46.406
That's why I told Bobby and them

01:37:46.408 --> 01:37:49.659
pull out all the stops.

01:37:49.661 --> 01:37:51.371
Make him a king.

01:37:54.416 --> 01:37:57.290
Sorry we couldn't do
enough for you, bruh.

01:37:57.292 --> 01:37:59.085
It ain't for not trying.

01:37:59.087 --> 01:38:01.294
Transit, commerce, leisure-

01:38:01.296 --> 01:38:03.046
is what IT creates!

01:38:03.048 --> 01:38:05.465
Travel, making purchases, and
relaxing-

01:38:05.467 --> 01:38:06.675
is what IT demands!

01:38:06.677 --> 01:38:15.643
And IT demands that you
participate!

01:38:15.645 --> 01:38:16.479
Baby!

01:38:43.297 --> 01:38:56.099
Come with me

01:38:56.101 --> 01:38:59.439
See you around, Johnny.

01:39:06.529 --> 01:39:08.698
Hey, Jimmy.

01:39:10.949 --> 01:39:12.577
That's a gift,

01:39:16.706 --> 01:39:18.080
when you don't know who you are,

01:39:18.082 --> 01:39:23.169
or why you're doing it...

01:39:23.171 --> 01:39:25.048
you put that on.

01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:40.727
Not sure if you caught it,

01:39:40.729 --> 01:39:42.688
but my name is Ronny.

01:39:42.690 --> 01:39:44.525
So here's what you're
going to do:

01:39:45.193 --> 01:39:47.067
You're going to take the road

01:39:47.069 --> 01:39:49.905
that you came in on, back.

01:39:50.614 --> 01:39:53.117
The road will lead you to a
new development

01:39:53.909 --> 01:39:56.328
on the east end of Kanbashi

01:39:57.579 --> 01:40:00.540
Kanbashi. Say it back to me
so I know you're listening.

01:40:00.542 --> 01:40:01.918
Kanbashi.

01:40:03.127 --> 01:40:06.130
You will meet Xiao Zhou,

01:40:06.588 --> 01:40:09.384
he'll be with a camel.

01:40:09.759 --> 01:40:12.134
I suggest you give him a
gratuity

01:40:12.136 --> 01:40:16.304
or gift of some kind.

01:40:16.306 --> 01:40:18.100
He would appreciate that.

01:40:20.979 --> 01:40:22.519
He will give you the camel.

01:40:22.521 --> 01:40:25.315
You will take the
camel and lead it

01:40:25.984 --> 01:40:27.944
gently to the east.

01:40:28.737 --> 01:40:31.948
There you will find the new
condominiums.

01:40:33.742 --> 01:40:36.411
What do I do then?

01:40:39.163 --> 01:40:41.875
I don't know, I never worked
for those guys.
