00:20.547 --> 00:21.447
Tribeca?

00:22.509 --> 00:23.171
Hey.

00:24.641 --> 00:26.008
I didn't mean to wake you up.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.276
Where you been?

00:27.377 --> 00:30.612
Uh... you know, just working.

00:30.713 --> 00:32.113
Till 5:00 p.m.?

00:32.215 --> 00:34.805
Yeah, uh, I got some beers

00:34.853 --> 00:37.119
with Tanner and Hoffman after work.

00:37.220 --> 00:39.922
Guess I kind of lost track of time.

00:41.457 --> 00:43.025
For future reference,
I like drinking beer

00:43.126 --> 00:44.586
and losing track of time, too.

00:44.656 --> 00:46.628
Yeah, it was really a last-minute thing.

00:46.729 --> 00:49.364
Hoffman was supposed to text you.

00:49.465 --> 00:50.832
All I got was this selfie.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.435
Huh.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.755
The food I stole from work

00:55.799 --> 00:57.606
is in the fridge, if you're hungry.

00:57.707 --> 01:00.275
I ate already, but thanks.

01:05.515 --> 01:07.749
You know, Tribeca, I don't know
what's gotten into you lately,

01:07.850 --> 01:10.986
but you've been acting really distant.

01:11.087 --> 01:12.287
What?

01:12.388 --> 01:15.791
I got to be honest...
I'm really frustrated.

01:15.892 --> 01:18.460
I wonder if it's time
we took a break from dating...

01:18.561 --> 01:20.329
- I totally agree...
- And got married.

01:21.531 --> 01:23.265
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.674
I'm gonna go sleep in the car.

01:54.697 --> 01:55.998
Geils.

01:58.001 --> 01:59.868
We'll be right there.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.271
Tribeca, we got a murder.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.507
Wake me up in 10 minutes.

02:05.608 --> 02:07.709
You know what? Wake yourself.

02:23.472 --> 02:25.236
What are we looking at, Scholls?

02:27.063 --> 02:27.996
Are you okay?

02:28.097 --> 02:29.064
Never better.

02:29.165 --> 02:30.532
Right this way.

02:30.633 --> 02:32.367
This is Dr. Jurgen Kottbulle...

02:32.468 --> 02:33.668
36 years old.

02:33.770 --> 02:35.604
Found dead on the floor
by his assistant.

02:35.705 --> 02:37.005
What do we know about him?

02:37.106 --> 02:39.708
He was a genius pioneer
in robotics and automation.

02:39.809 --> 02:41.676
You ever hear of the dishwasher?

02:41.778 --> 02:42.944
He had two.

02:43.046 --> 02:44.479
Although recently, it was
rumored that he'd been working

02:44.580 --> 02:46.114
on some pretty out-there stuff.

02:49.485 --> 02:51.317
Until someone broke his neck.

02:52.388 --> 02:54.790
I was obsessed with robots as a kid.

02:54.891 --> 02:56.324
I always wanted one that would help

02:56.426 --> 02:57.659
take care of me and my brothers...

02:57.760 --> 02:59.528
cook us dinner, make our beds,

02:59.629 --> 03:01.029
tell us we did a good job...

03:02.465 --> 03:04.066
but my mom never got one for us.

03:05.755 --> 03:07.191
This place is immaculate.

03:07.301 --> 03:09.971
No signs of forced entry,
no evidence of a scuffle.

03:10.073 --> 03:12.007
Necks don't break themselves.
How did he...

03:12.108 --> 03:14.209
I don't know, okay?
I get paid either way.

03:14.310 --> 03:16.078
Monica, take five.

03:16.846 --> 03:18.880
The hell's gotten into her?

03:18.981 --> 03:20.048
Gambling.

03:20.149 --> 03:21.283
It's gotten pretty bad.

03:21.384 --> 03:22.717
Come on now.

03:22.819 --> 03:23.718
Yes!

03:23.820 --> 03:25.821
The world lost a brilliant man today.

03:25.922 --> 03:27.989
I'm sorry. And you are...?

03:28.091 --> 03:29.074
Victoria.

03:29.269 --> 03:31.860
I've been Dr. Kottbulle's
assistant for three years.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.061
Detective Jay Geils.

03:33.162 --> 03:35.297
I-I mean, uh, Detective Jay Geils.

03:35.398 --> 03:37.432
This is my friend Andrew Jarbaca.

03:37.533 --> 03:38.967
"Andrew's" fine.

03:39.825 --> 03:41.103
Cappuccino?

03:41.204 --> 03:42.137
Yes, please.

03:42.238 --> 03:43.472
Tea for me.

03:43.573 --> 03:45.607
What can you tell us about this morning?

03:45.708 --> 03:47.309
I entered the lab at 7:00 a.m...

03:59.989 --> 04:01.590
And that's when you two arrived.

04:01.691 --> 04:04.259
Did anyone else see your boss
before you came in?

04:04.360 --> 04:05.694
I don't think so.

04:13.035 --> 04:15.770
Did he have any enemies?
People with an ax to grind?

04:15.872 --> 04:19.541
His former partner, Dr. Frederick Wurst.

04:23.713 --> 04:25.680
Wurst was jealous of Dr. Kottbulle

04:25.781 --> 04:29.184
and would send frequent angry,
incoherent e-mails.

04:29.285 --> 04:30.585
Pardon my French, but...

04:30.686 --> 04:32.454
il est un grand trou de cul.

04:32.633 --> 04:34.460
Well, thank you
for talking to us, Victoria.

04:34.538 --> 04:35.824
We'll be in touch.

04:35.925 --> 04:37.125
Of course.

04:37.226 --> 04:40.201
And if I can be of any help,
please don't hesitate to call.

04:41.063 --> 04:42.631
Here's my card.

04:55.311 --> 04:56.611
Oh.

04:56.712 --> 04:59.614
We got an address on Frederick Wurst.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.017
Geils?

05:02.118 --> 05:03.785
Don't worry about it.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.457
Maybe we should talk about
what happened last night.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.893
Victoria seemed really upset
about her boss's death.

05:11.994 --> 05:13.328
You think she had a crush on him?

05:13.429 --> 05:14.796
What's going on with us?

05:14.897 --> 05:16.765
Are we taking a break?
Are we not taking a break?

05:16.866 --> 05:18.900
Why don't you talk about it
with Tanner and Hoffman

05:18.970 --> 05:20.168
when you go out for beers tonight?

05:21.337 --> 05:23.071
I'm really trying, Geils.

05:23.172 --> 05:25.273
It's just every relationship before this

05:25.374 --> 05:26.341
has ended in disaster.

05:28.778 --> 05:31.346
I'm just asking you
to bear with me, okay?

05:31.447 --> 05:33.782
Okay. I'm trying, too, you know.

05:36.619 --> 05:37.819
Dr. Wurst?

05:37.920 --> 05:39.321
Come in. Come in.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.056
I'm so sorry I can't be there in person.

05:41.157 --> 05:43.959
I'm currently at a conference in Vienna.

05:44.060 --> 05:45.060
That's convenient.

05:45.161 --> 05:47.596
How long have you been
out of the country?

05:47.697 --> 05:49.264
Oh, I arrived last Thursday,

05:49.365 --> 05:51.633
so way before any murders
were committed.

05:51.734 --> 05:53.602
Please, sit down. Make yourself at home.

05:53.892 --> 05:55.474
Doctor, I don't know if you've heard,

05:55.553 --> 05:58.028
but your former partner,
Dr. Jurgen Kottbulle,

05:58.129 --> 05:59.797
was found dead this morning.

05:59.898 --> 06:01.665
Oh! Great news!

06:01.766 --> 06:02.966
Thank you, detectives.

06:03.067 --> 06:05.102
Suppose there's no right way to grieve.

06:05.203 --> 06:06.603
Well, when the world is rid of a madman,

06:06.704 --> 06:09.373
the only logical response is joy.

06:09.474 --> 06:11.041
You see, Dr. Kottbulle was developing

06:11.142 --> 06:13.544
artificially intelligent beings
who would surely

06:13.645 --> 06:16.580
have hastened mankind's
extinction from the Earth.

06:16.681 --> 06:17.699
Not a fan.

06:17.762 --> 06:21.919
In fact, let me show you a
lecture we gave two years ago.

06:22.020 --> 06:24.021
What if I told you in 20 years,

06:24.122 --> 06:28.725
90% of all relationships
will be computer-to-computer?

06:28.827 --> 06:32.629
And what if I told you
that these very same computers

06:32.730 --> 06:34.264
will murder you in your sleep?

06:34.365 --> 06:36.066
I told you not to tell them that.

06:36.167 --> 06:37.568
They need to know. Don't push me!

06:37.669 --> 06:39.169
What are you talking about?!
Don't push me!

06:39.270 --> 06:40.370
Oh!

06:40.472 --> 06:42.172
I hope you die!

06:42.273 --> 06:45.142
Aside from our weekly dinner,
I never saw him after that.

06:45.243 --> 06:47.778
Okay, we'll be in touch.

06:47.879 --> 06:49.646
Do you mind if I use your restroom?

06:49.747 --> 06:51.114
Uh...

06:51.216 --> 06:53.283
actually, I don't...
I don't have a restroom.

06:53.384 --> 06:55.219
No, isn't that it right here?

06:55.320 --> 06:56.920
No. No!

06:57.021 --> 06:58.055
Yeah. No!

06:58.156 --> 06:59.490
Are you sure this isn't a restroom?

06:59.591 --> 07:00.657
Yeah, I'm sure.

07:01.659 --> 07:03.727
Something's not sitting right.
I feel like it's a trap.

07:03.828 --> 07:05.028
Let's skip dinner at your parents' house

07:05.129 --> 07:07.097
and go straight to your brother's play.

07:07.198 --> 07:08.046
Okay, Wiedner.

07:08.047 --> 07:09.733
Tell me you got something
on the egghead murder.

07:09.834 --> 07:11.001
We have a suspect...

07:11.102 --> 07:12.836
his former partner, Frederick Wurst.

07:12.937 --> 07:14.304
He has a motive but not a shred

07:14.405 --> 07:16.440
of physical evidence
connecting him to the crime...

07:16.541 --> 07:18.775
no fingerprints,
no footprints, no fibers.

07:18.877 --> 07:20.844
So we find one eyelash, one tire tread,

07:20.945 --> 07:22.256
and this Wurst is cooked.

07:22.257 --> 07:24.114
We grilled Wurst, but I don't
think he cuts the mustard.

07:24.215 --> 07:26.283
- No dog in the hunt?
- He's just a sour Kraut.

07:26.384 --> 07:27.951
So we ketchup with him later.

07:28.052 --> 07:29.887
As much as I'd relish
raking him over the coals,

07:29.988 --> 07:31.188
frankly, he's a weenie.

07:31.289 --> 07:33.457
I just don't think
he snapped a man's neck.

07:33.558 --> 07:35.292
Maybe a woman or a child,

07:35.393 --> 07:37.261
but not a full-grown professor.

07:37.362 --> 07:38.862
What about the beautiful assistant?

07:38.963 --> 07:40.597
- Did anyone...
- I'll do it.

07:40.698 --> 07:42.199
You cut me off.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.069
I was gonna ask
if anyone questioned her.

07:44.171 --> 07:45.412
I'll do it.

07:45.685 --> 07:47.772
But I think I should... do it alone

07:47.835 --> 07:48.839
so we don't spook her.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.123
All right, let me know
what you find out.

07:54.412 --> 07:55.646
Hey.

07:55.747 --> 07:58.785
Since when did we start questioning
suspects alone, partner?

07:58.837 --> 08:00.717
Oh, I mean, you can
come along if you want.

08:00.818 --> 08:02.519
I just thought you'd be bored, you know?

08:02.620 --> 08:04.021
"Where were you the night of?

08:04.122 --> 08:05.822
"Did you murder him?" Blah, blah, blah.

08:05.924 --> 08:07.791
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

08:07.892 --> 08:09.226
Promise you'll call me
if you rough her up?

08:09.327 --> 08:10.394
I promise.

08:16.134 --> 08:18.201
Hey, Stirelli, I got a really
big interrogation tonight.

08:18.303 --> 08:19.570
Can I borrow a toothpick?

08:19.671 --> 08:20.837
You got it, Geils.

08:26.814 --> 08:29.269
Let the record show
I'm talking to Victoria...

08:29.769 --> 08:30.789
Nova.

08:31.500 --> 08:35.956
Victoria Nova, assistant
to Dr. Jurgen Kottbulle.

08:37.562 --> 08:38.900
Do you know why you're here?

08:38.900 --> 08:41.599
Yes... you are hoping
I can shed some light

08:41.700 --> 08:42.979
on Dr. Kottbulle's death.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.835
You said the last time you saw him alive

08:44.936 --> 08:46.203
was the previous night.

08:46.304 --> 08:48.239
When I left the office on Tuesday night.

08:48.340 --> 08:50.241
He was enjoying a "M.A.S.H." rerun

08:50.342 --> 08:52.962
and eating a Hungry Man
Salisbury steak dinner.

08:52.976 --> 08:54.801
Do you love Dr. Kottbulle?

08:55.863 --> 08:57.197
What is love?

08:57.549 --> 08:59.083
I know what you mean.

08:59.184 --> 09:01.585
Beats the hell out of me.

09:01.686 --> 09:04.188
But seriously, did you have
any feelings for Dr. Kottbulle?

09:04.289 --> 09:05.476
What is feelings?

09:05.477 --> 09:07.258
Like, did you think
about him all the time?

09:07.359 --> 09:09.160
Could you only picture
your life with him in it?

09:09.261 --> 09:11.969
Do you have feelings for Andrew Jarbaca?

09:12.752 --> 09:14.732
Good feelings, bad feelings...

09:14.833 --> 09:16.133
all kinds of feelings.

09:16.234 --> 09:19.036
I think I had feelings
for Dr. Kottbulle...

09:19.137 --> 09:22.173
good feelings, bad feelings,

09:22.274 --> 09:23.707
all kinds of feelings.

09:23.809 --> 09:28.446
Like I got a giant pit
in my stomach all the time.

09:28.469 --> 09:31.004
Your intestinal tract
is functioning normally.

09:31.042 --> 09:33.176
No foreign bodies detected.

09:33.284 --> 09:35.919
You have a really good
sense of humor, Victoria.

09:35.981 --> 09:37.382
I like talking to you.

09:37.656 --> 09:39.123
And I like your toothpick,

09:39.224 --> 09:40.974
one they call Geils.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.306
Let me ask you something.

09:43.336 --> 09:44.903
If you were gonna go out
and have beers with my friends,

09:44.989 --> 09:46.456
you'd invite me along, right?

09:46.652 --> 09:47.818
Of course I would.

09:47.896 --> 09:49.176
I'm not a monster.

09:50.130 --> 09:52.366
I'm sorry you have bad feelings.

09:53.163 --> 09:55.531
For some reason,
I'm not having them right now.

09:55.632 --> 09:56.598
Because of me.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.851
That might have something to do with it.

09:59.736 --> 10:01.103
Just tell me you didn't
have anything to do

10:01.204 --> 10:03.472
with Dr. Kottbulle's death.

10:03.573 --> 10:05.641
You know what? Never mind.
Don't say anything.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.551
I don't know nothing
more from the last time you called.

10:15.652 --> 10:17.720
Could be a cannonball, could be a knife.

10:17.821 --> 10:19.955
Oh, my God, how
many times you gonna call here

10:20.056 --> 10:21.586
asking about semen?

10:21.664 --> 10:23.076
Hoffman, line 6.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.326
What's going on?

10:28.388 --> 10:29.423
Where's Scholls?

10:29.424 --> 10:31.015
She didn't come in,

10:31.016 --> 10:32.234
and I didn't want to get her in trouble

10:32.335 --> 10:34.003
with the lieutenant, so...

10:34.104 --> 10:36.372
Were you able to get
to the Kottbulle murder?

10:36.473 --> 10:38.574
Kottbulle? Kottbulle.

10:38.675 --> 10:43.212
Kottbulle... Kottbulle... Kottbulle...

10:43.313 --> 10:44.813
Oh, right here.

10:44.914 --> 10:48.517
Now, whatever broke this dude's
neck had to be crazy-strong.

10:48.618 --> 10:50.239
Snapped his spine right in half.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.720
Can a human do that?

10:51.821 --> 10:54.356
Oh, no. We talking about
some type of machine.

10:54.457 --> 10:56.058
So a machine that's mobile enough

10:56.159 --> 10:58.583
to walk into an office
and snap a guy's neck.

10:59.295 --> 11:00.662
Isn't that called a robot?

11:02.899 --> 11:04.800
We're gonna need some help.

11:15.645 --> 11:18.153
Boy, you kids sure
do love your vegetables.

11:20.927 --> 11:22.160
Here you go, Brian.

11:27.090 --> 11:28.557
Hello, Diane.

11:28.658 --> 11:32.294
And we try so hard to
keep rats out of the cafeteria.

11:33.270 --> 11:35.972
What brings you to Carl's Jr.
Junior High School?

11:36.199 --> 11:37.800
I need your help.

11:37.901 --> 11:40.436
I know we didn't leave things
on the best of terms.

11:40.537 --> 11:43.276
You mean imprisoning me for
conspiracy and attempted murder?

11:43.277 --> 11:45.407
But who testified
at your parole hearing?

11:45.508 --> 11:47.509
You did... against me getting parole.

11:47.610 --> 11:49.387
All the more satisfying that you're out.

11:49.388 --> 11:50.821
Just stay away from me.

11:50.923 --> 11:52.590
I have an apartment, a good job.

11:52.691 --> 11:55.159
I'm sitting in on some classes
to open up career options,

11:55.260 --> 11:57.528
maybe in fashion design.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.530
Check out these shorts
I made in home ec.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.899
The subject I'm really
interested in is science...

12:02.000 --> 12:04.368
Specifically, artificial intelligence.

12:04.469 --> 12:05.870
Under the terms of my parole,

12:05.971 --> 12:07.438
I'm not allowed near
anything electronic...

12:07.539 --> 12:10.007
computers, the Internet, cellphones.

12:10.108 --> 12:12.009
I can't even buy a vibrator.

12:12.110 --> 12:13.344
So whatever it is you're talking about,

12:13.445 --> 12:15.479
can you please buy me a vibrator?

12:15.580 --> 12:16.614
If you agree to help me,

12:16.715 --> 12:19.218
there's a lot I can do
to improve your situation.

12:19.385 --> 12:20.619
I'm listening.

12:20.819 --> 12:24.021
Does the name Jurgen Kottbulle
mean anything to you?

12:26.798 --> 12:29.433
The FBI has had its eye
on Kottbulle for a long time.

12:29.534 --> 12:32.052
We used some of his technology
to catfish world leaders.

12:32.053 --> 12:35.243
One of his algorithms dated
Angela Merkel for six months.

12:35.883 --> 12:39.012
I heard he was working on some
pretty out-there A.I. stuff.

12:39.013 --> 12:40.638
How out-there is out-there?

12:40.755 --> 12:42.479
Maybe this will answer your question.

12:45.629 --> 12:47.918
Not that one.

12:52.698 --> 12:55.533
Wait. Is that Victoria, his assistant?

12:55.634 --> 12:56.883
It's an early version.

12:57.226 --> 12:58.536
Early version?

12:59.905 --> 13:02.140
Victoria's a robot.

13:02.622 --> 13:03.868
She's more than just a robot.

13:03.869 --> 13:07.159
She's a work of unparalleled genius.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.789
Victoria, activate.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.190
I am Victoria.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.526
I know 20 animal sounds.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.395
Cow... Mmmmmmmmm.

13:15.496 --> 13:17.597
Monkey... Ooh-ooh-aah-aah.

13:17.698 --> 13:18.631
Victoria.

13:18.732 --> 13:19.665
Listening.

13:19.767 --> 13:20.833
Who designed you?

13:20.934 --> 13:22.735
Dr. Jurgen Kottbulle.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.637
Did you kill him?

13:24.738 --> 13:27.106
Cat... Meow. Meow.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.374
Answer the question.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.776
She may not understand
the question, Tribeca.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.978
The software in this
model is pretty basic.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.880
Your shoes are pretty basic.

13:33.981 --> 13:34.658
What'd you say?

13:34.659 --> 13:36.849
Crow... Raaak! Raaak!

13:36.950 --> 13:39.786
Is it possible that
this thing killed Kottbulle?

13:39.887 --> 13:41.075
Well, it's not likely.

13:41.138 --> 13:43.990
I mean, most A.I. have code
written into their operating system

13:44.091 --> 13:45.825
that prevents them from harming humans.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.760
Let me see what's in here.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.797
Of course, this is
very advanced programming.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.199
Maybe he found the safety codes
got in the way of producing

13:53.300 --> 13:55.068
sophisticated emotional responses.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.170
But it's still a machine,
and for a machine to rise

13:57.271 --> 13:59.038
to that level of anger and violence

13:59.139 --> 14:01.440
presupposes a highly developed cognition

14:01.442 --> 14:05.078
that doesn't exist in anything
I've ever seen or read about.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.049
I think we have to start
with the assumption

14:10.150 --> 14:11.350
that robots are not violent

14:11.452 --> 14:13.619
till we see actual tangible evidence

14:13.720 --> 14:14.821
to the contrary.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.460
Actually, we can answer
all these questions

14:20.561 --> 14:22.195
by looking in her memory chip.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.264
Thanks, Diane.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.500
Couldn't have done it without your help.

14:33.763 --> 14:36.552
You can't run from your
problems anymore, Scholls.

14:36.553 --> 14:39.567
And if I have to look into the stomach
of one more fat, old, dead guy,

14:39.568 --> 14:40.700
I'm gonna lose my mind.

14:40.701 --> 14:42.837
I'm in too deep, Tanner.
They're gonna kill me.

14:42.938 --> 14:45.711
They may be thugs, but they
are still businessmen.

14:46.308 --> 14:50.545
But I ain't gonna lie...
this may get ugly.

14:52.114 --> 14:53.882
Okay... Monica Scholls.

14:54.042 --> 14:54.964
Date of birth?

14:54.965 --> 14:56.850
March 20, 1958.

14:57.473 --> 14:59.374
Here it is.

14:59.655 --> 15:03.857
The balance on your loan is $11,347,

15:04.253 --> 15:07.060
and it looks like you missed
your last two payments.

15:07.888 --> 15:09.640
You don't scare us, Spencer!

15:10.328 --> 15:12.730
I used to eat guys like
you for breakfast.

15:12.831 --> 15:14.598
Okay, now let's talk options.

15:14.699 --> 15:17.267
Are you familiar with
our GentlePay program?

15:17.369 --> 15:19.536
No! Why don't you familiarize us?

15:19.637 --> 15:22.172
Sure. So, basically,
it breaks down your balance

15:22.273 --> 15:24.608
into monthly payments,
but if you miss one,

15:24.709 --> 15:26.410
there is a 30-day grace period.

15:26.511 --> 15:29.593
However, after that,
we do charge a $3 fee.

15:30.148 --> 15:33.017
Well, let me tell you
about my plan, Spencer.

15:33.118 --> 15:34.952
You're gonna waive that fee.

15:35.053 --> 15:37.354
Actually, we do have
a promotion right now

15:37.455 --> 15:40.324
where we're waiving the fee
for the first 12 months.

15:40.425 --> 15:42.990
Now, I don't want to overload
you guys with information,

15:43.069 --> 15:45.329
but we have partnered with Office Depot

15:45.430 --> 15:47.031
to offer you a Visa credit card

15:47.132 --> 15:49.666
with a starting limit of $10,000.

15:52.270 --> 15:53.960
We will both take one!

16:03.264 --> 16:04.915
Turn me on, Geils.

16:05.016 --> 16:07.017
Oh, I plan to.

16:12.223 --> 16:13.524
Mm.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.292
There's something you need
to know about me.

16:15.393 --> 16:17.494
It's okay... I already have it.

16:18.129 --> 16:19.730
Geils, listen to me.

16:19.831 --> 16:21.065
I'm not what you think I am.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.300
I know you're a robot.

16:23.401 --> 16:25.135
And that doesn't bother you?

16:25.236 --> 16:26.804
Look, I've been with plenty of humans,

16:26.905 --> 16:30.174
and they can be as cold
and unfeeling as a machine.

16:30.275 --> 16:33.343
Now, I've never made love to a toaster

16:33.445 --> 16:34.545
or a DVD player,

16:34.646 --> 16:36.880
but being with you
these past couple of days,

16:36.981 --> 16:39.616
I feel like you're the most
human toaster I'll ever know.

16:39.717 --> 16:41.118
Does that make sense?

16:41.219 --> 16:42.619
I want you, Geils.

16:45.023 --> 16:47.724
Um, do you have something?

16:47.826 --> 16:49.159
Of course.

16:49.260 --> 16:50.227
USB?

16:51.896 --> 16:53.063
HDMI?

16:54.799 --> 16:55.966
Bluetooth?

16:58.002 --> 16:58.969
Pairing device.

16:59.070 --> 17:02.239
Connected to Geils, Jay.

17:04.142 --> 17:06.076
Uploading. Uploading.

17:06.176 --> 17:07.978
A file of the same name is detected.

17:08.079 --> 17:09.346
Replace.

17:09.446 --> 17:11.915
No. Rename. Rename.

17:12.016 --> 17:14.251
Creating untitled folder.

17:14.352 --> 17:17.654
Buffering, buffering, buffering.

17:19.557 --> 17:20.424
Upload is complete.

17:20.525 --> 17:23.292
You may safely eject your device.

17:34.269 --> 17:35.836
Cow goes...

17:35.838 --> 17:37.172
Cow goes...

17:37.174 --> 17:37.940
Cow goes...

17:37.942 --> 17:39.609
She's really messed up.

17:39.611 --> 17:40.444
Victoria!

17:40.473 --> 17:42.174
Number 5 is alive!

17:42.580 --> 17:44.214
Victoria, we need you to listen.

17:44.315 --> 17:46.316
[Deep, distorted] ♪ Daisy, Daisy ♪

17:46.417 --> 17:48.506
♪ Give me your answer do ♪

17:49.520 --> 17:51.722
This is hopeless. No one's
gonna get these references.

17:51.823 --> 17:54.291
Hang on. I can see where
Kottbulle put the last update.

17:54.392 --> 17:56.793
Let me try to access it.

17:56.894 --> 17:59.596
Hello, Doctor. My name is Victoria.

17:59.697 --> 18:00.897
Victoria.

18:00.998 --> 18:02.132
I love you.

18:02.233 --> 18:03.400
Do you love me?

18:03.501 --> 18:05.669
Uh, Diane, do you want the room?

18:05.770 --> 18:08.271
He was trying to program them
to experience human love.

18:08.372 --> 18:10.907
Victoria, do you love me?

18:11.008 --> 18:12.943
I... I...

18:13.044 --> 18:15.145
I... I...

18:17.415 --> 18:20.016
It can't handle the emotion
without frying the system.

18:20.118 --> 18:21.318
At least in this version.

18:21.419 --> 18:23.887
Did she kill Kottbulle? Yes or no?

18:23.988 --> 18:26.623
No. She hasn't been active
in the past six months.

18:26.724 --> 18:28.625
But the new Victoria has.

18:29.894 --> 18:31.194
Geils.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.670
Uh, we should probably get going.

18:33.734 --> 18:35.735
I've been off the radar for a while.

18:35.767 --> 18:38.835
You want to leave?
You have bad feelings?

18:38.936 --> 18:41.838
Honestly, Victoria, I am
starting to have bad feelings.

18:41.939 --> 18:44.731
Andrew Jarbaca and I
never officially broke up.

18:45.309 --> 18:48.671
You are a robot, so it's a bit
of a gray area, but...

18:48.890 --> 18:50.647
We are not love?

18:50.748 --> 18:52.616
I mean, we definitely
shared a connection,

18:52.717 --> 18:55.318
that's for sure,
but as far as love goes,

18:55.419 --> 18:57.354
I think maybe I need a little more time.

18:57.455 --> 18:59.489
I don't have time, one they call Geils.

18:59.590 --> 19:02.392
They will want to imprison me
for killing Dr. Kottbulle.

19:02.548 --> 19:03.581
I should get my notebook.

19:03.683 --> 19:05.918
Please love me, Geils.
Let's talk about thi...

19:09.756 --> 19:13.225
Okay, I love you. I love you so much.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.694
Insincerity detected.

19:28.207 --> 19:29.741
This is not what it looks like.

19:29.842 --> 19:32.010
It's okay, Geils. I get it.

19:32.111 --> 19:34.123
You get this?

19:35.381 --> 19:37.049
I haven't been very nice to you lately,

19:37.150 --> 19:40.105
so this isn't a big surprise to me.

19:41.921 --> 19:43.433
So, what do we do now?

19:44.123 --> 19:46.558
Maybe we... take a little break?

19:48.307 --> 19:49.641
Yeah, maybe.

19:58.037 --> 19:59.738
I bet things cooled off mighty quick

19:59.839 --> 20:01.607
once you found out
she was a robot, right?

20:03.042 --> 20:05.077
Yeah. Well...

20:05.178 --> 20:06.612
Wait, what?

20:06.713 --> 20:07.846
Ew!

20:07.947 --> 20:09.448
How do you even do that?

20:09.549 --> 20:11.683
- Well, I first used...
- I don't want to hear about it!

20:11.784 --> 20:12.684
Let's go!

20:12.785 --> 20:14.553
Okay. Let me get my pants.

20:15.788 --> 20:17.422
Victoria.

20:17.523 --> 20:18.457
Listening.

20:18.558 --> 20:19.257
I'm sorry.

20:19.359 --> 20:20.492
This wasn't your fault.

20:20.593 --> 20:21.893
I think we all have some things

20:21.995 --> 20:23.595
we might need to learn about love.

20:23.696 --> 20:26.365
You give me good feelings, Geils.

20:27.567 --> 20:30.002
Stop talking to it! Oh, my God!

20:30.103 --> 20:32.170
All right! God.
