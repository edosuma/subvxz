WEBVTT

04:42.809 --> 04:46.746
Hey! Hey!
He's over there!

07:27.207 --> 07:28.608
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

07:28.642 --> 07:30.277
<i>I'm flying over the mountain,</i>
<i>out of reception.</i>

07:30.310 --> 07:35.048
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
<i>Seven AM, Ravenhill Hangar.</i>

07:35.082 --> 07:38.018
<i>Retirement, here we come.</i>

08:22.662 --> 08:23.964
Ah.

09:17.784 --> 09:18.886
Who are you?

09:18.920 --> 09:20.720
Who am I?
Who the hell are you?

09:20.754 --> 09:21.721
Where's Rahul?

09:21.755 --> 09:23.457
Who the hell is Rahul?

09:32.032 --> 09:35.035
Get out of the trunk, slowly.

09:41.408 --> 09:43.977
- My bag's--
- No, I'll get it.

09:45.679 --> 09:47.180
Move there.

09:55.055 --> 09:56.623
Back more.

10:12.506 --> 10:14.274
They're nail clippers.

10:26.286 --> 10:28.622
Hey! Careful with that!

10:50.043 --> 10:51.411
Tie this.

11:04.157 --> 11:05.792
Did you kill Rahul?

11:06.928 --> 11:09.062
The guy who was driving me.

11:09.095 --> 11:11.131
No, but his nose
might need some work.

11:11.164 --> 11:13.166
Actually bandage it.

11:13.199 --> 11:15.135
Actually bandage it!
Lift it up.

11:15.168 --> 11:17.170
Ow! Turn around.

11:26.546 --> 11:28.248
It's real, asshole.

11:31.551 --> 11:33.353
I'm keeping this.

11:33.386 --> 11:35.288
Not that you're
any good with it.

11:36.824 --> 11:38.091
Get your shit.

11:38.124 --> 11:40.493
Don't walk away from me,
<i>hijoeputa.</i>

11:45.298 --> 11:47.233
We need to get
the hell out of here.

11:47.267 --> 11:49.369
- Excuse me, we?
- Yes, we.

11:49.402 --> 11:51.371
And we need to go
before my husband catches up.

11:51.404 --> 11:54.174
I don't give a shit
about your shitty marriage.

11:54.207 --> 11:57.177
Temple's not gonna
see it that way.

11:58.244 --> 12:00.246
- Temple?
- Yes.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.248
- Temple's your husband.
- Yes.

12:02.282 --> 12:04.317
As in the guy
that I just ripped off?

12:13.159 --> 12:17.430
What? What are
you doing? Hey!
Hey, stop!

12:18.565 --> 12:20.868
You can't just leave me
in the middle of nowhere!

12:20.901 --> 12:23.004
Hell I can't.

12:23.037 --> 12:24.704
Stop!

12:24.738 --> 12:28.742
We're probably
going the same way,
just drop me off!

12:28.775 --> 12:29.877
Ow!

12:32.178 --> 12:35.682
Listen, once Temple finds out
I was trying to leave,

12:35.715 --> 12:37.484
he will kill me.

12:39.419 --> 12:43.356
Yeah. He's crazy.
Good luck.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.360
He'll make me talk!

12:47.394 --> 12:48.996
And I'll be forced
to tell him everything!

12:49.030 --> 12:51.197
Everyone will be
looking for you!

12:51.231 --> 12:53.566
Or you can take me
with you, please!

12:53.600 --> 12:56.369
Please! Please,
for my baby!

13:04.210 --> 13:07.148
Seven AM tomorrow,
Ravenhill Hangar!

13:29.502 --> 13:33.373
Where exactly are you going?

14:13.013 --> 14:14.949
Where did we
find this guy?

14:14.982 --> 14:17.151
I told you ten times,

14:17.184 --> 14:19.385
I don't know
anything about that!

14:19.419 --> 14:21.688
I don't know this dude!

14:23.289 --> 14:25.291
Come on, man.

14:25.325 --> 14:26.760
I don't see you
all morning,

14:26.793 --> 14:29.529
then some dude busts in here,
takes, like, half our cash,

14:29.562 --> 14:32.099
and drives out of here
in your car?

14:32.133 --> 14:34.567
And you don't know
anything about it?

14:38.973 --> 14:40.841
Mia's missing.

14:42.575 --> 14:44.444
You know anything about that?

14:44.477 --> 14:46.780
Yo, Skinny,
if some dude ripped us off,

14:46.814 --> 14:50.350
let's go get him.
You and me, right now.

14:50.383 --> 14:52.219
Let's kill this dude.

14:52.253 --> 14:54.287
Untie me man, come on!

14:58.391 --> 15:00.326
Yeah, I don't know, man.

15:03.730 --> 15:04.832
That's a nice touch.

15:06.566 --> 15:08.235
How did that work?
Did he do it for you,

15:08.269 --> 15:10.204
or you bash your face
into a window, or what?

15:11.806 --> 15:13.140
Skinny, listen to me!

15:13.174 --> 15:15.642
I don't know anything
about this shit,
all right?!

15:17.510 --> 15:19.880
I'd never sell us out
like that.

15:21.115 --> 15:22.817
You know me.

15:25.052 --> 15:26.619
We're brothers.

15:28.989 --> 15:32.692
Oh, yeah. This thing.

15:34.527 --> 15:35.963
Hmm.

15:35.996 --> 15:37.965
Seems kind of meaningless now.

16:17.437 --> 16:18.806
Skinny!

16:23.476 --> 16:24.979
He's lying.

16:26.613 --> 16:30.050
Temple, I swear,
I don't know anything
about the guy or the money--

16:43.197 --> 16:45.698
Relax.

16:45.732 --> 16:48.534
He's the reason
the stranger got away.

16:56.277 --> 16:57.344
Where's Mia?

17:05.986 --> 17:08.255
Now I understand...

17:08.289 --> 17:10.257
the way you used
to look at her.

17:18.631 --> 17:22.535
You try to steal my wife
and unborn son from me.

17:22.568 --> 17:24.805
No, it's not like that.

17:28.943 --> 17:30.377
What's it like?

17:32.980 --> 17:34.480
It was her idea.

17:37.084 --> 17:39.153
She wanted to leave.

17:39.186 --> 17:40.888
She made me do it.

17:43.324 --> 17:47.593
Mia came to me.
She begged me.

17:48.795 --> 17:51.098
She wanted to get the baby
out of here.

17:51.131 --> 17:54.201
I would never try
to steal her from you,
I swear.

17:57.603 --> 17:59.873
Look, look. Look.

18:05.312 --> 18:06.880
That's where she's headed.

18:08.449 --> 18:10.384
A motel.
An old friend of mine

18:10.417 --> 18:12.086
was gonna get her
out of the country.

18:13.153 --> 18:16.689
That dude crashed into us
and took off with her.

18:16.723 --> 18:19.726
That's all I know,
I swear to God.

19:18.052 --> 19:19.286
Where's the Frenchman?

19:19.319 --> 19:20.821
Taking care
of that thing.

19:20.854 --> 19:23.257
Make sure he's at the motel
when Mia gets there.

19:23.290 --> 19:24.590
What about the guy?

19:30.397 --> 19:31.899
That one's yours,
shithead.

19:31.932 --> 19:33.733
If you don't like it,
make your own.

19:34.935 --> 19:37.504
- They're taking forever.
- I got shit to do.

19:37.538 --> 19:39.139
Yeah, right.

19:42.509 --> 19:43.977
Who's that?

20:08.902 --> 20:10.104
Up, up!

20:30.090 --> 20:32.593
My apologies.

20:32.625 --> 20:35.863
I always assume
everyone speaks French.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.967
I'm looking for a couple.

20:41.468 --> 20:44.471
I heard
they're around here.

20:44.505 --> 20:45.539
Never seen 'em.

21:07.594 --> 21:08.829
<i>Bonjour.</i>

21:08.862 --> 21:10.796
<i>It's Skinny.</i>
<i>We got a problem.</i>

21:10.831 --> 21:13.500
- Why?
<i>- We got ripped off.</i>
<i>Some guy took Mia.</i>

21:13.534 --> 21:15.936
<i>I'm sending a pin for where</i>
<i>we think they're headed.</i>

21:15.969 --> 21:19.506
<i>- Finish up.</i>
- No sweat.

21:51.405 --> 21:52.973
Hey!

22:12.559 --> 22:14.161
Finish up in here.

22:15.596 --> 22:17.698
Someone will reach out.

22:17.730 --> 22:19.833
You work for Temple now.

22:39.419 --> 22:41.588
Um, hello?

22:41.622 --> 22:42.923
"Um, hello" what?

22:42.956 --> 22:44.825
Could you not?
It's bad for the baby.

22:44.858 --> 22:47.094
Well, you're doing a great job
keeping it safe so far.

22:47.127 --> 22:50.197
- Him, not it.
- Congratulations.
Like I give a shit.

22:50.230 --> 22:53.200
I'm doing all this
to give my son a real life.

22:53.233 --> 22:55.869
Yeah, well, life on the run
isn't much of a real life.

22:55.902 --> 22:58.505
I won't be running.
My family's in Colombia.

22:58.538 --> 23:00.173
Temple can't get to me there.

23:01.842 --> 23:03.810
What's at this motel of yours?

23:04.777 --> 23:07.381
Some guy's meeting me there.
Rahul knows him.

23:08.915 --> 23:10.317
You ever meet
this guy before?

23:10.350 --> 23:12.185
No.

23:12.219 --> 23:14.288
- So you don't
know his name.
- So?

23:14.321 --> 23:16.390
You don't know anything
about this guy?

23:16.423 --> 23:17.924
- No.
- What are you, stupid?

23:17.958 --> 23:20.761
You're a drug lord's wife.
You don't think
someone's gonna whack you?

23:20.793 --> 23:22.362
It's the stupidest plan
I ever heard of.

23:22.396 --> 23:25.065
Listen, asshole!
You don't know what it was
like for me back there.

23:25.098 --> 23:27.501
You gotta stop pretending
you know what's good
for me or my baby

23:27.534 --> 23:28.902
and shut your smug face.

23:28.935 --> 23:31.938
Look, if you don't like
the sound of my voice,

23:31.972 --> 23:34.941
I can always put you
back in the trunk,
small fry.

23:34.975 --> 23:36.743
- Like you would.
- Try me!

23:36.777 --> 23:38.679
You're only risking
your life for money!

23:38.712 --> 23:41.982
And I doubt your plan
is to drop that bag off
at an orphanage!

23:42.015 --> 23:44.851
Don't act like
you're better than me!
You're a thief!

23:44.885 --> 23:46.887
Yeah, you're right,
it isn't for charity.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.555
It's for me, my retirement.

23:48.588 --> 23:50.857
And tomorrow morning
I'm going to be
getting on an airplane

23:50.891 --> 23:52.993
with someone
that I actually know,

23:53.026 --> 23:55.195
and flying far,
far away from here.

23:55.228 --> 23:57.431
And I'm not gonna lose
a minute of sleep over it.

23:57.464 --> 23:59.900
Sure as shit ain't gonna be
thinking about you.

24:03.337 --> 24:05.472
Where are you flying to?

24:05.505 --> 24:06.606
Not Colombia.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.475
Well, good.

24:08.508 --> 24:09.743
That's right,
it is good.

24:09.776 --> 24:11.144
That's right, it is good.

24:11.178 --> 24:12.846
What are you,
six years old?

24:17.784 --> 24:19.252
Goddamn brat.

24:19.286 --> 24:21.488
Look, I don't think
we should be
talking to each other

24:21.521 --> 24:22.989
for the rest of the drive.

24:23.023 --> 24:25.459
- Fine with me.
- Fine by me.

24:58.325 --> 25:01.094
What are you doing?
Pull in.

25:03.029 --> 25:04.931
What if your boy
gave you up?

25:06.633 --> 25:08.335
Rahul wouldn't do that.

25:11.004 --> 25:13.340
Look, this is
my only chance
to get home.

25:13.373 --> 25:14.941
I'm not gonna hitchhike
out of the country.

25:14.975 --> 25:16.410
I'll get caught for sure.

25:16.443 --> 25:19.246
And you don't want me
getting caught, remember?

25:19.279 --> 25:21.381
So just pull in.

25:41.501 --> 25:42.669
Your funeral.

26:03.757 --> 26:07.661
Well, thanks for the ride.

26:07.694 --> 26:09.329
I'm Mia, by the way.

26:15.735 --> 26:17.537
Enjoy your retirement.

28:39.679 --> 28:41.015
Where's the guy?

28:41.048 --> 28:43.149
What? I don't...

28:43.183 --> 28:45.719
The guy who took you,
took the money.

28:45.752 --> 28:48.254
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he went.

29:00.133 --> 29:01.301
Yeah.

29:02.469 --> 29:05.205
We'll wait
for Temple to arrive.

29:16.282 --> 29:20.186
I have worked for your husband
for a long time.

29:21.388 --> 29:26.159
If I say that I found you
in a bloody mess,

29:26.192 --> 29:28.294
he'll believe me.

29:30.597 --> 29:34.401
Where... is... he?

31:38.025 --> 31:40.527
What's got into you,
sweetheart?

31:40.560 --> 31:42.428
Has he brainwashed you?

31:43.964 --> 31:46.934
You are gonna die a slow death
for this, stranger.

31:48.568 --> 31:51.238
Come on, darling.
Put the gun down,
come with me.

31:51.272 --> 31:53.073
I'd rather die
than go back with you.

32:11.225 --> 32:13.493
See, I told you
you're no good with guns.

32:13.526 --> 32:16.130
Now stop this nonsense.

32:16.163 --> 32:19.465
We're gonna have this baby.
We're gonna be a family.

32:19.499 --> 32:21.869
Now come with me!
Get in the car!

32:23.503 --> 32:25.906
You're right,
I'm not good with guns.

32:28.708 --> 32:29.944
But I bet he is.

32:31.212 --> 32:32.445
No, no, no, no!

32:43.356 --> 32:44.724
Let's have some fun!

32:51.397 --> 32:53.200
She's got my son in there!

32:53.234 --> 32:54.802
Get her back!

33:14.822 --> 33:16.556
You're not helping,
shut up right now!

33:16.589 --> 33:18.359
- Shut up!
- You're not driving
fast enough!

33:18.391 --> 33:20.127
- I'm trying to go fast!
- Go faster!

33:20.160 --> 33:21.461
I'm trying!

33:28.534 --> 33:29.803
Damn!

33:42.415 --> 33:43.984
Get up, get up, get up!

34:45.312 --> 34:46.746
Hold on!

34:54.288 --> 34:55.823
Should have buckled up.

34:57.992 --> 34:59.026
You okay?

35:18.345 --> 35:21.581
Goddammit, run. Come on!

35:23.317 --> 35:25.685
I'm gonna kill
this bastard myself.

35:28.755 --> 35:31.058
What are you doing?

35:31.091 --> 35:32.192
What's he doing?

35:32.226 --> 35:35.095
I don't know.
But don't stop.

35:41.534 --> 35:44.771
- I'm backing out, Temple.
- I said don't stop!

36:12.166 --> 36:14.068
He'll never stop.

36:49.769 --> 36:53.340
- He's not down there.
- No shit.

36:53.373 --> 36:55.109
So what,
he disappeared?

36:56.310 --> 36:59.213
I told you, don't stop!

36:59.246 --> 37:01.647
He was shooting at us,
I was trying to save you.

37:01.681 --> 37:03.016
From my wife and son?

37:03.050 --> 37:05.385
She's turned on you, Temple.
Can't you see that?

37:05.419 --> 37:07.387
She betrayed you.

37:07.421 --> 37:09.655
Look, Skinny,
can you tell him?

37:09.689 --> 37:14.694
She's running away.
It's obvious. Right?

37:14.727 --> 37:16.396
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:16.430 --> 37:17.564
Oh, for Christ's sake.

37:17.598 --> 37:19.066
Temple, look, you know what--

37:24.271 --> 37:26.540
We're down
four guys,
plus the Frenchman.

37:33.347 --> 37:35.849
Thanks for nothing,
you tattooed little freak.

37:35.883 --> 37:37.518
Next time,
I'll give him the knuckles.

37:40.020 --> 37:42.389
No. Look, get Dennis' body.

37:42.422 --> 37:45.092
We need a lift.
I'll drop a pin.

37:48.228 --> 37:50.264
Ride's on the way.

37:50.297 --> 37:52.299
I want every crackhead

37:52.332 --> 37:55.402
and every goddamned banger
out there looking for her.

37:55.435 --> 37:58.605
And you better find her.

38:07.381 --> 38:09.383
Look, there's a clinic.

38:09.416 --> 38:10.584
Are they open?

38:10.617 --> 38:12.785
I don't know,
but we gotta get off the road.

38:24.898 --> 38:26.466
Come on, hurry up.

38:28.502 --> 38:30.270
Come on, let's see
if we can catch it.

38:30.304 --> 38:32.839
Come on, come on, come on.

38:32.873 --> 38:35.042
Whoa, wait, wait!
No, don't close.

38:35.075 --> 38:37.544
- No, I'm sorry--
- Don't close, no, please.

38:37.578 --> 38:38.744
Are you okay?

38:38.778 --> 38:40.847
Oh... Come on,
come inside.

38:40.881 --> 38:43.183
I'll take a look at you.
Come on.

38:54.828 --> 38:57.297
You're gonna be
okay, come on.

38:57.331 --> 38:58.565
Oh, geez.

38:58.599 --> 39:00.133
All right,
can you get up here?

39:00.167 --> 39:01.401
Here.

39:01.435 --> 39:05.138
Okay, good. Oh.
All right.

39:07.307 --> 39:09.109
Your partner?

39:10.644 --> 39:12.412
It's complicated.

39:14.780 --> 39:18.485
All right, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

39:18.518 --> 39:20.187
Wait in the other
room, please.

39:32.666 --> 39:34.067
Sorry I didn't
call you earlier, Vic.

39:34.101 --> 39:36.236
It's been a hell
of a hectic day.

39:36.270 --> 39:37.404
But don't worry,

39:37.437 --> 39:39.940
I'm gonna be there
bright and early
in the morning.

39:39.973 --> 39:41.275
<i>Funny you should</i>
<i>say that.</i>

39:41.308 --> 39:43.477
<i>I've had kind of</i>
<i>a hectic day myself.</i>

39:43.510 --> 39:45.679
<i>- I ran into some trouble--</i>
- Trouble?
What kind of trouble?

39:45.712 --> 39:48.682
<i>I took care of</i>
<i>it,</i>
<i>managed to commandeer us</i>
<i>another one.</i>

39:48.715 --> 39:50.284
<i>But there will be eyes</i>
<i>looking for it,</i>

39:50.317 --> 39:52.819
<i>so we've got about</i>
<i>a ten-minute window, tops,</i>

39:52.853 --> 39:54.554
<i>for me to touch down,</i>
<i>scoop you up.</i>

39:54.588 --> 39:57.524
<i>I hope that doesn't throw</i>
<i>a wrench into the works.</i>

39:57.557 --> 39:58.992
Well, speaking of wrenches,

39:59.026 --> 40:00.327
how do you feel
about another passenger?

40:00.360 --> 40:02.629
<i>How do you feel</i>
<i>about an extra ten grand?</i>

40:02.663 --> 40:04.531
Come on,
she's pregnant, Vic.

40:04.564 --> 40:06.266
<i>In that case, it's 20.</i>

40:06.300 --> 40:07.768
Not very funny.

40:07.801 --> 40:09.169
She's gotta get to Colombia.

40:09.202 --> 40:12.839
<i>Colombia?</i>
<i>What happened to Venice?</i>

40:12.873 --> 40:15.375
<i>Look, I can't risk</i>
<i>a world tour here.</i>

40:15.409 --> 40:17.144
<i>You either escape</i>
<i>with the money,</i>

40:17.177 --> 40:20.681
<i>or you die poor and alone,</i>
<i>like your old man.</i>

40:20.714 --> 40:23.817
Venice. She can find
her way from there.

40:23.850 --> 40:25.986
<i>Whatever you say, kid.</i>
<i>See you.</i>

40:26.019 --> 40:28.121
Okay. See you, buddy.

40:28.155 --> 40:30.590
The baby's heart rate's normal,
and the bleeding's stopped,

40:30.624 --> 40:33.527
so I'm hoping
it's unrelated
to the pregnancy.

40:33.560 --> 40:36.663
But to be safe,
you should get
an ultrasound.

40:36.697 --> 40:38.332
And she needs to rest.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.502
So your baby's okay?

40:42.536 --> 40:43.737
Yeah.

40:43.770 --> 40:46.840
How's your baby doing?

40:46.873 --> 40:48.842
When's the last time
you ate something?

40:50.777 --> 40:52.479
I should get some food.

40:53.847 --> 40:57.150
Is it okay if we stay here
a little bit longer?

40:58.385 --> 41:01.054
As long as you're out
before we open, it's fine.

41:02.489 --> 41:05.827
I'll be in my office
canceling dinner plans.

41:05.859 --> 41:08.028
Thank you.

41:10.697 --> 41:12.366
Well, now I feel bad.

41:15.902 --> 41:17.938
So I talked to my guy.

41:21.541 --> 41:23.577
You can fly with us.

41:23.610 --> 41:25.011
Really? That's okay?

41:25.045 --> 41:29.216
Yeah. You can call it payback
for your bodyguard services.

41:31.017 --> 41:33.920
Hey, uh, thanks for
coming back for me,
by the way.

41:33.954 --> 41:35.389
At the motel.

41:35.422 --> 41:38.959
Yeah, well, I didn't
really think anyone wanted

41:38.992 --> 41:41.628
- that sad-ass
clown doll anyway.

41:43.163 --> 41:46.566
My only regret is,
is that I left it
back there.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.003
It's okay.
You made an effort.

41:50.036 --> 41:54.274
I-I don't really
understand why,
but I appreciate it.

42:03.517 --> 42:05.285
I'm gonna go
get some food.

42:07.889 --> 42:09.389
Get some rest.

42:10.991 --> 42:14.461
So this is really all
just for an early retirement?

42:14.494 --> 42:18.064
Not like--
like a heart transplant
or mob debts?

42:18.098 --> 42:20.934
This is just so you can be
some boring guy on a beach?

42:22.736 --> 42:24.137
Yeah.

44:45.813 --> 44:46.847
How you doing tonight?

44:46.881 --> 44:49.951
I'm doing
pretty good, officers.

44:49.984 --> 44:51.318
What happened to your arm?

44:51.351 --> 44:54.354
Oh, you know, I just
got into a knife fight.

44:54.387 --> 44:56.756
You should see the other guy,
he's a bloody mess.

45:05.165 --> 45:07.634
No, in all seriousness,
it's a--

45:07.667 --> 45:09.536
I took a dart to the arm.

45:09.569 --> 45:11.538
Competitive darts.

45:14.041 --> 45:15.943
It was a big dart.

45:15.977 --> 45:18.545
Hmm.

45:18.578 --> 45:19.613
I've taken a dart.

45:19.646 --> 45:21.816
- You've taken a dart?
- It was at your house.

45:21.849 --> 45:24.417
<i>Car 854,</i>
<i>we've got a possible 420...</i>

45:25.987 --> 45:27.287
10-4, we'll respond.

45:28.956 --> 45:30.790
Yeah, well, uh,
take care of that arm.

45:32.059 --> 45:33.793
Yeah, you bet, Officer.

45:33.828 --> 45:35.662
Good luck on the darts.

47:49.395 --> 47:52.398
Sir, are you
all right?

47:55.635 --> 47:57.670
Oh, we need to get you an
ambulance.

47:57.704 --> 48:00.174
No, water.

48:00.207 --> 48:01.508
I just need water.

48:01.541 --> 48:03.510
Do we have any water?

48:03.543 --> 48:06.046
Nah, no water,
just diet cola.

48:06.080 --> 48:08.681
I'd actually be
grateful for a cup.

48:45.953 --> 48:47.754
<i>All units, we got a call</i>

48:47.787 --> 48:50.490
<i>about a suspicious White male</i>
<i>in a black Mustang</i>

48:50.523 --> 48:52.659
<i>at the Fill-N-Go</i>
<i>in south Saxton.</i>

48:52.692 --> 48:55.728
<i>Employee over there</i>
<i>is a little spooked. Over.</i>

49:06.974 --> 49:08.341
There we go.

49:10.577 --> 49:13.914
- Okay, he's alive.
Should we call him?
- No.

49:13.948 --> 49:16.416
First I want to tell him
that funny story of yours.

49:16.449 --> 49:18.651
You see,
my boy Ronnie here,

49:18.685 --> 49:21.222
we were scoring off
these bikers today.

49:21.255 --> 49:23.257
And they told him

49:23.290 --> 49:25.960
there's a reward for anyone
who spots a, uh...

49:27.094 --> 49:32.867
what was it again, Ronnie?
A-a pregnant lady and...
her kidnapper?

49:36.369 --> 49:37.872
Imagine that, huh?

49:37.905 --> 49:39.539
A, uh...

49:39.572 --> 49:44.078
a pregnant lady,
and her kidnapper.

49:45.179 --> 49:47.848
Apparently,
these two ripped off
some guy named Temple.

49:49.316 --> 49:50.985
Guess he's a big deal.

49:52.853 --> 49:57.557
Now, we can make the call,
and he'll roll right on up.

49:59.759 --> 50:00.760
Or...

50:02.495 --> 50:06.399
Or, you can tell us
what it is you took from him.

50:07.667 --> 50:11.038
'Cause the way I figure,

50:11.071 --> 50:12.806
it could be one of two things:

50:14.074 --> 50:15.508
Money...

50:17.945 --> 50:19.646
or drugs.

50:21.215 --> 50:26.619
And, well, Ronnie and I,
yeah, we happen to like both.

50:28.188 --> 50:33.127
But where is it, huh?

50:33.160 --> 50:34.794
Where is it?

50:34.828 --> 50:37.563
'Cause it sure ain't in
that busted-ass car
of yours out there.

50:37.597 --> 50:41.035
And this bitch,
she don't know a damn thing.

50:41.068 --> 50:44.939
And I'm not about to beat it
out of a pregnant lady.

50:44.972 --> 50:46.639
Yet.

50:51.111 --> 50:52.745
So that leaves you.

50:54.915 --> 50:56.516
Kidnapper.

50:58.551 --> 51:02.689
So... where is it?

51:08.461 --> 51:10.563
See that woman
you got tied over there?

51:13.434 --> 51:15.468
That's Temple's wife.

51:16.370 --> 51:19.706
She's carrying
his unborn child.

51:20.941 --> 51:22.810
That's all he wants.

51:24.044 --> 51:26.313
That's it.

51:26.347 --> 51:28.382
I'm serious.

51:28.415 --> 51:30.750
Let-let's just call the guy
and turn him in
and get the reward.

51:30.783 --> 51:32.019
They said they'd hook us up.

51:32.052 --> 51:35.055
With what, Ronnie, huh?
A measly eight-ball?

51:35.089 --> 51:36.489
Use your head.

51:36.522 --> 51:38.691
Does this guy look
like a kidnapper to you?

51:40.027 --> 51:41.694
He has something.

51:41.728 --> 51:45.498
You have something,
and I want it.

51:45.531 --> 51:47.901
Now where is it?

51:53.073 --> 51:55.242
- Sketch--
- No!

51:56.776 --> 52:00.180
- What are you doing?
- Shut up! Shut up!

52:03.884 --> 52:08.222
Now, let me be
perfectly clear.

52:08.255 --> 52:10.824
If one of you
doesn't start talking,

52:10.858 --> 52:13.760
this doesn't end well
for anybody.

52:15.595 --> 52:18.866
Now, where is it?!

52:24.805 --> 52:27.307
Don't!
There's money.

52:28.842 --> 52:30.643
What'd I tell you, Ronnie?

52:32.312 --> 52:33.746
See?

52:33.780 --> 52:36.950
Isn't it better when we
all just get along? Yeah?

52:38.986 --> 52:41.188
Now, where is it?

52:43.556 --> 52:45.025
It's out front.

52:45.059 --> 52:46.260
Where?

52:46.293 --> 52:49.263
I don't know,
someone must've
hit me in the head.

52:49.296 --> 52:51.899
Listen, I'm not
playing around here.

52:53.067 --> 52:54.935
Okay, take it easy.

52:54.968 --> 52:59.106
The black metal cabinet,
top drawer,

52:59.139 --> 53:01.641
behind the reception desk.

53:01.674 --> 53:05.645
If I come back out here
without that bag...

53:07.747 --> 53:09.917
I'm gonna look forward
to the second date.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.488
Hey, Sketch, man,
what are we doing?

53:14.521 --> 53:15.856
You didn't say nothing
about killing anyone.

53:15.889 --> 53:17.858
- I don't wanna kill anyone.
- Just stay here!

53:17.891 --> 53:19.659
We shouldn't be doing this,
this is a bad idea.

53:19.692 --> 53:21.295
Ripping off this Temple guy
doesn't seem like--

53:21.328 --> 53:24.098
Hey! Well, I guess
you don't need your share
of the money, then

53:24.131 --> 53:27.000
if you're gonna be
such a punk about it.

53:27.034 --> 53:29.336
Now stay here.

53:37.311 --> 53:39.313
Forget this.

53:47.955 --> 53:50.023
Hey, those people
you were looking for?

53:51.191 --> 53:52.625
Pregnant lady and the guy?

53:53.494 --> 53:55.028
Tell your people I got him.

53:55.062 --> 53:57.797
Yeah, Point View Medical,
off Main.

53:59.199 --> 54:02.102
They're fine. Hurry.

54:03.337 --> 54:05.038
He said there was
a reward, right?

54:08.308 --> 54:09.742
Hello?

54:10.611 --> 54:12.279
Hey.

54:13.514 --> 54:14.815
Your name's Ronnie,
right?

54:14.848 --> 54:16.150
Hey, shut up, man,
don't talk to me.

54:16.183 --> 54:19.186
Hey, come on,
listen to me.
Look at her.

54:19.219 --> 54:21.654
Look, she's bleeding out.
She's gonna die.

54:21.687 --> 54:23.789
You want her death
on your hands?

54:23.824 --> 54:26.692
It's exactly
what you don't want.

54:26.726 --> 54:28.095
Come on, help her!

54:28.862 --> 54:29.963
Man, I don't know,

54:29.997 --> 54:32.332
she looks all right to me,
I don't...

54:48.882 --> 54:50.450
He's heavier than I thought.

54:53.253 --> 54:56.323
You take care of her.
I'll be back.

54:57.958 --> 54:59.526
Are you okay?

54:59.560 --> 55:01.794
I don't know.
I don't know.

55:01.828 --> 55:05.032
How does it look?

55:05.065 --> 55:07.868
- I think it went right through.
- Oh, lucky me.

55:24.418 --> 55:25.919
Go.

55:50.177 --> 55:51.744
Ronnie!

55:56.984 --> 55:59.453
- We gotta go.
- No.

55:59.486 --> 56:01.188
I'm getting my money.

56:01.221 --> 56:02.923
No, just leave it!

56:48.568 --> 56:49.836
Hey!

56:49.870 --> 56:51.972
Get out,
or I'll blow your head off!

56:55.475 --> 56:58.011
No! No!

57:58.405 --> 58:00.640
You selfish bastard.

58:03.243 --> 58:05.545
You gotta go back for them.

58:09.316 --> 58:11.184
What took you so long?
We gotta...

58:12.452 --> 58:14.221
You've been busy.

58:15.857 --> 58:17.825
Your husband's waiting.

58:33.707 --> 58:36.243
Stop it.
Stop running, Mia.

58:37.377 --> 58:39.479
I want to help you!

58:39.513 --> 58:41.348
And you know
I can't do that.

58:41.381 --> 58:42.783
We belong to him.

58:42.817 --> 58:44.584
Not today.

58:55.929 --> 58:57.330
How you doing?

58:58.498 --> 59:00.133
Are you kidding?

59:01.034 --> 59:03.470
Look, I know things
have got out of hand.

59:05.405 --> 59:07.674
We can start over.

59:07.707 --> 59:10.444
It's just all about trust.

59:10.477 --> 59:12.746
Trust from me.

59:12.779 --> 59:14.514
Trust from you.

59:36.470 --> 59:40.640
Now... let's start...

59:41.675 --> 59:45.145
with you telling me
where your little friend is.

59:45.178 --> 59:47.214
And where my money is.

59:49.316 --> 59:52.018
- Mia!
- I don't know where he went.

59:52.052 --> 59:54.287
Some guys jumped us
and took off with his money.

59:54.321 --> 59:55.555
His money?

59:55.589 --> 59:57.524
With your money.
Your money.

59:57.557 --> 59:58.960
Mia, Mia!

1:00:08.768 --> 1:00:11.271
Look, listen,
please stop this.

1:00:11.304 --> 1:00:12.372
Stop!

1:00:12.405 --> 1:00:15.075
You know me
better than anyone.

1:00:15.108 --> 1:00:18.578
We had a great life,
me and you, and the family.

1:00:18.612 --> 1:00:21.381
Please, Mia,
you're breaking my heart.

1:00:23.583 --> 1:00:25.318
Trust me.

1:00:44.204 --> 1:00:46.740
Drop your weapons
and get on the ground!

1:00:51.077 --> 1:00:52.813
Let me deal with this.

1:00:59.020 --> 1:01:02.122
Officer, no problem here.

1:01:07.594 --> 1:01:09.997
I have a pregnant wife
in the car.

1:01:10.031 --> 1:01:12.198
I said
drop your weapons!

1:01:17.872 --> 1:01:20.106
I said put
your weapons down!

1:01:22.409 --> 1:01:23.543
Hey!

1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:29.215
Come on, jackass,
where are you?

1:01:32.619 --> 1:01:34.321
You blind?

1:01:46.232 --> 1:01:48.201
I said drop your weapons!

1:01:52.772 --> 1:01:56.443
This is your last warning.
Backup's on the way.

1:01:58.813 --> 1:02:01.414
You hear that, Griz?
Backup.

1:02:02.817 --> 1:02:04.117
Edwards!

1:02:06.286 --> 1:02:09.356
You with me?

1:02:25.538 --> 1:02:26.640
Backup's here.

1:02:34.882 --> 1:02:36.516
I thought you were dead.

1:03:02.910 --> 1:03:05.012
Please.

1:03:05.046 --> 1:03:06.780
I got a family.

1:03:08.548 --> 1:03:11.451
Well, I guess we got
something in common.

1:03:11.484 --> 1:03:12.920
I'm sorry for their loss.

1:03:28.135 --> 1:03:29.502
Come on, get in!

1:03:33.773 --> 1:03:35.308
What are you doing!?

1:03:41.548 --> 1:03:42.749
Stop!

1:03:44.819 --> 1:03:46.153
My son's in there.

1:03:46.187 --> 1:03:47.587
Temple.

1:03:48.688 --> 1:03:50.024
Get my boy!

1:03:59.466 --> 1:04:01.568
Where am I going?
Where's this friend
of yours?

1:04:01.601 --> 1:04:03.904
Well, we're not gonna get to him
with all this heat on us.

1:04:03.938 --> 1:04:04.939
So what should I do?

1:04:04.972 --> 1:04:06.372
I don't know,
I'm figuring it out.

1:04:06.406 --> 1:04:08.374
- Just drive.
- I am driving!

1:04:16.783 --> 1:04:17.918
Jesus!

1:04:21.122 --> 1:04:22.823
Keep going faster,
they're gaining on us.

1:04:22.857 --> 1:04:25.226
I'm trying! God!

1:04:28.162 --> 1:04:30.663
Come on, Vic.
Vic! Listen!

1:04:30.697 --> 1:04:33.767
You still got that old
airplane graveyard
with that piece of shit plane?

1:04:33.801 --> 1:04:36.036
<i>No way we're flying in</i>
<i>that thing, it's worthless.</i>

1:04:36.070 --> 1:04:38.505
- Duly noted.
<i>- I thought you said</i>
there was no more surprises.

1:04:38.538 --> 1:04:40.507
- Look--
<i>- We're on a tight schedule!</i>

1:04:40.540 --> 1:04:43.309
Goddammit, no,
everything's okay.
Ten-minute window out,

1:04:43.343 --> 1:04:45.345
just don't land
until I tell you it's safe.

1:04:45.378 --> 1:04:47.380
<i>- Safe?!</i>
- Just wait for my call.

1:04:47.413 --> 1:04:48.983
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>is going on down there?</i>

1:04:49.016 --> 1:04:50.450
Damn idiot. Head west.

1:05:07.902 --> 1:05:09.870
They're leaving town.

1:05:51.011 --> 1:05:53.948
If they keep doing
this bodyguard bullshit,
we'll lose 'em again.

1:05:57.750 --> 1:05:59.053
Yeah, I know.

1:06:02.455 --> 1:06:04.091
It's coming up quick!

1:06:04.124 --> 1:06:05.192
Right here,
turn right.

1:06:05.226 --> 1:06:06.426
- Here?
- Turn right, right here!

1:06:06.459 --> 1:06:07.460
I'm going! I'm going!

1:06:43.563 --> 1:06:45.299
Come on, let's go!

1:07:06.954 --> 1:07:08.588
What are we doing?
What's the plan?

1:07:08.621 --> 1:07:11.358
- We're gonna wait
for him here.
- What?

1:07:11.392 --> 1:07:13.127
You'll be driving
that way north.

1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:15.963
Go about five miles,
that's where Vic's gonna be.

1:07:15.996 --> 1:07:17.430
I'm gonna stay here.

1:07:18.564 --> 1:07:20.067
I'm not gonna
leave you here alone.

1:07:20.100 --> 1:07:22.269
Listen to me, Mia.
You've got to get
out of here

1:07:22.303 --> 1:07:24.872
and you've got to
trust me on this.
Get the hell out of here.

1:07:32.679 --> 1:07:35.782
I'm gonna be back for this.
Do you trust me now?

1:07:52.665 --> 1:07:55.702
Keep the engine low
until you're out of earshot.

1:07:55.735 --> 1:07:58.005
You <i>are </i> gonna see me
again, okay?

1:07:59.173 --> 1:08:01.041
Go. Go!

1:09:27.828 --> 1:09:30.431
You want to die
like a rat?

1:09:30.464 --> 1:09:33.033
We're not coming out
until we know we're safe.

1:09:33.067 --> 1:09:34.468
I don't see their car.

1:09:40.606 --> 1:09:43.776
Mia! Let me hear
your voice.

1:09:44.545 --> 1:09:46.413
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

1:09:46.447 --> 1:09:48.882
She's not here.

1:09:49.649 --> 1:09:51.552
Let's make a deal.

1:09:51.584 --> 1:09:55.222
I give you back the money,
I get to keep Mia.

1:09:55.255 --> 1:09:57.057
No deal!

1:09:59.792 --> 1:10:01.594
This is bullshit.

1:10:03.931 --> 1:10:05.466
That's her.

1:10:05.499 --> 1:10:07.733
You do what you do.

1:10:34.561 --> 1:10:35.896
Shit.

1:11:09.563 --> 1:11:11.298
Not today.
