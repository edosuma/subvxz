Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:34.164 --> 00:36.924
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:37.084 --> 00:39.444
Unfortunately, we must begin
with the tragic events

00:39.604 --> 00:42.484
in Christchurch, where 50 people
were killed and many injured

00:42.644 --> 00:45.604
when a white supremacist
terrorist attacked two mosques.

00:45.764 --> 00:49.684
And look, this wasn't just
a disgusting act from a fucking asshole.

00:49.844 --> 00:53.244
It was an affront to the basic values
of the people of New Zealand,

00:53.404 --> 00:55.404
as their prime minister pointed out.

00:55.564 --> 00:59.884
We were not chosen for this act
of violence because we condone racism,

01:00.044 --> 01:02.324
because we're an enclave
for extremism.

01:02.484 --> 01:08.004
We were chosen for the very fact
that we are none of these things.

01:08.164 --> 01:12.124
She's absolutely right, because
New Zealand is an incredible place.

01:12.284 --> 01:15.564
And I know that we make fun
of it on this show all the time.

01:15.724 --> 01:19.724
There is honestly nothing I like more
than making fun of New Zealand,

01:19.884 --> 01:22.524
but part of that may be because
controversies over there

01:22.684 --> 01:24.684
are handled
with charm and good cheer.

01:24.844 --> 01:26.524
How can you not love a country

01:26.684 --> 01:30.684
that has a contest to design a new flag
for itself and someone submits this:

01:30.844 --> 01:34.844
a kiwi bird shooting lasers
out of its eyes?

01:35.004 --> 01:38.724
My point is, New Zealand is amazing,
and it is showing its strength

01:38.884 --> 01:40.644
in how it's responded to this tragedy.

01:40.804 --> 01:44.444
The same, sadly, cannot be said
for Australia's Fraser Anning,

01:44.604 --> 01:49.044
a hard-line racist politician
and melted candle of Ed Harris.

01:49.204 --> 01:51.604
We've actually talked about him
before on this show,

01:51.764 --> 01:54.524
after he proposed a final
solution to Muslim immigration.

01:54.684 --> 01:58.804
And his response to the Christchurch
shooting was very much on brand.

01:58.964 --> 02:01.284
This was the statement
from an Australian senator:

02:01.444 --> 02:03.844
"The real cause of bloodshed
on New Zealand streets

02:04.004 --> 02:06.724
"is the immigration program
which allowed Muslim fanatics

02:06.884 --> 02:09.003
to migrate to New Zealand
in the first place."

02:09.163 --> 02:12.004
It goes on to say, "Muslims may
have been the victims today.

02:12.164 --> 02:14.044
Usually they are the perpetrators."

02:14.204 --> 02:18.964
Holy shit. That might be
the worst possible response

02:19.124 --> 02:21.284
to what happened,
because even if you responded

02:21.444 --> 02:23.924
by saying, "The Christchurch
attack makes me wonder,

02:24.084 --> 02:26.724
"was 'DuckTales' supposed to be
in Scotland or America?

02:26.884 --> 02:29.964
I'm guessing America, but when
did Scrooge McDuck move?"

02:30.124 --> 02:32.044
I mean, you're way off topic there,

02:32.204 --> 02:36.643
but you're also not calling Muslims
terrorists, so still a better response.

02:36.803 --> 02:40.003
Thankfully, there was immediate outcry
following Anning's comments,

02:40.163 --> 02:42.203
and one young Australian
went a bit further.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.883
These sort of things happen.

02:44.043 --> 02:48.483
When people are getting
attacked in their own--

02:50.003 --> 02:51.403
<i>You weren't seeing things there.</i>

02:51.563 --> 02:54.203
<i>The teenager smacked an egg</i>
<i>on the senator's head.</i>

02:54.363 --> 02:57.443
<i>You saw the senator fight back.</i>
<i>The boy was led away by police.</i>

02:57.603 --> 03:00.883
<i>He's reportedly been released.</i>
<i>A fundraising page has been set up</i>

03:01.043 --> 03:04.603
<i>to collect donations to cover</i>
<i>the teenager's legal fees</i>

03:04.763 --> 03:06.843
<i>and to "buy more eggs."</i>

03:07.003 --> 03:09.483
"More eggs."
That is fantastic.

03:09.643 --> 03:13.683
And look, you might argue that an act
like that has no place in politics,

03:13.843 --> 03:17.483
and I'm sure Fraser Anning is furious.
He did punch that boy in the face.

03:17.643 --> 03:20.403
But I've prepared a statement
in response on that.

03:20.563 --> 03:22.923
The real cause of Anning
getting hit with an egg

03:23.083 --> 03:26.483
is Anning saying things
that prompt people to throw eggs at him.

03:26.643 --> 03:31.483
He may be the victim today,
but usually he's a huge fucking asshole.

03:31.643 --> 03:35.003
But for now--for now,
let's move on to Brexit,

03:35.163 --> 03:37.083
which is, of course,
a mash-up of the words

03:37.243 --> 03:40.683
"Britain," "exit,"
and "gone to shit."

03:40.843 --> 03:44.963
Britain's deadline to leave the EU
is March 29th, just 12 days away now.

03:45.123 --> 03:48.643
The country's had two years to prepare
for this, so how's it going?

03:48.803 --> 03:52.083
Well, this week was, to put it mildly,
a little bumpy.

03:52.243 --> 03:53.563
To the casual observer,

03:53.723 --> 03:56.123
it may seem Westminster
and our political leaders

03:56.283 --> 03:58.283
are in a bit of a mess over Brexit.

03:58.443 --> 04:00.163
Experts tend to disagree.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.443
They say it's very much worse
than that.

04:02.603 --> 04:06.643
Wow. Do you know how bad
things have to be in Britain

04:06.803 --> 04:10.083
for something to be very much
worse than a bit of a mess?

04:10.243 --> 04:12.723
Remember, this is a people
who refer to three decades

04:12.883 --> 04:15.523
of sustained sectarian violence
as "The Troubles,"

04:15.683 --> 04:19.442
which sounds like an adorable euphemism
for an infant with diarrhea.

04:19.603 --> 04:23.403
"Oh, dear, it seems Alistair
has come down with the troubles again."

04:23.563 --> 04:25.483
But things are indeed a real mess.

04:25.643 --> 04:28.483
You remember in January,
Theresa May presented to Parliament

04:28.643 --> 04:31.643
an agreement she made with the EU,
not for a final Brexit deal,

04:31.803 --> 04:35.483
but just for a transition period, during
which time that deal would be made.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.683
That plan was voted down
in Parliament by historic margin.

04:38.843 --> 04:42.883
This week, she re-presented essentially
the same deal with minor tweaks,

04:43.043 --> 04:47.603
and even supporters of the deal
defended it in less than glowing terms.

04:47.763 --> 04:50.283
It's a choice I do not want
to have to make

04:50.443 --> 04:55.683
between--excuse my language,
Mr. Speaker-- a turd of a deal,

04:55.843 --> 05:00.003
which has now been taken away
and polished and is now a polished turd.

05:00.163 --> 05:03.483
But it might be the best turd
that we've got before us.

05:03.643 --> 05:08.843
Oh, my God. I only wish
that right before the Brexit vote,

05:09.003 --> 05:11.523
a wormhole had opened up in time,

05:11.683 --> 05:13.603
so people could see
that two years later,

05:13.763 --> 05:16.243
supporters of the plan to leave
will be saying,

05:16.403 --> 05:20.403
"All of our options are turds.
Come join me in my turd menagerie.

05:20.563 --> 05:22.843
"Select a turd
that suits your fancy,

05:23.003 --> 05:25.683
"so we may ride that turd
into a bold new era,

05:25.843 --> 05:28.123
an era of turds."

05:28.283 --> 05:30.123
As if things
weren't already dumb enough,

05:30.283 --> 05:33.603
due to the UK's stupid ban on using
parliamentary footage for comedy,

05:33.763 --> 05:36.163
we once more cannot show
that clip in Britain,

05:36.323 --> 05:40.363
so in place of it, they'll be watching,
with no explanation whatsoever,

05:40.523 --> 05:43.203
this clip from a 1980s dating video.

05:43.363 --> 05:46.043
I'm Mike, and if you're sitting there
watching this tape,

05:46.203 --> 05:48.603
smoking your cigarette,
hit the fast-forward button,

05:48.763 --> 05:51.483
'cause I don't smoke
and I don't like people who do smoke.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.963
Wow.
Hard swipe left from Mike there.

05:55.123 --> 05:57.723
That's the point. Britain will get
Mike the Non-Smoker

05:57.883 --> 05:59.523
followed by a long joke about turds,

05:59.683 --> 06:01.683
and they'll have brought that
on themselves.

06:01.843 --> 06:05.443
Unsurprisingly, May's plan was
voted down by Parliament on Tuesday,

06:05.603 --> 06:07.963
taking Britain closer
to the worst-case scenario,

06:08.123 --> 06:11.643
the so-called "no-deal Brexit."
And the good news is, the next day,

06:11.803 --> 06:14.643
they voted in favor of a motion
saying that, no matter what,

06:14.803 --> 06:17.003
Britain won't leave the EU
without a deal.

06:17.163 --> 06:19.723
The bad news is,
that motion is non-binding.

06:19.883 --> 06:24.363
So it carries all the legal obligation
of a wish painted onto a lantern

06:24.523 --> 06:28.163
and released into the deep purple
of the star-dappled summertime sky.

06:28.323 --> 06:30.843
Or, as one European official put it...

06:31.003 --> 06:34.763
Just by saying we don't want a no-deal
Brexit doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

06:34.923 --> 06:39.043
Now, there isn't an alternative,
or if there isn't an idea

06:39.203 --> 06:42.202
of what the alternative
could be by the 29th of March,

06:42.362 --> 06:45.362
there might be a no-deal Brexit,
even if nobody wants it.

06:45.522 --> 06:49.522
You know, European history
is rife of moments

06:49.682 --> 06:52.482
where things happened
that nobody wanted.

06:52.642 --> 06:54.002
Is it, though?

06:54.162 --> 06:57.042
I'm not saying European history
isn't rife with bad moments,

06:57.202 --> 07:00.642
but almost always, those things happened
because people wanted them to,

07:00.802 --> 07:04.162
even people who might later say
they didn't want the things to happen.

07:04.322 --> 07:06.722
Many of them did.
Not everyone's grandpa was

07:06.882 --> 07:10.002
one of the good ones trying to prevent
the things from happening.

07:10.162 --> 07:13.762
Look at the numbers. They couldn't all
have been one of the few good ones.

07:13.922 --> 07:16.962
Somebody's grandpa must have
wanted the things to happen,

07:17.122 --> 07:20.722
and here is the thing, it was yours.

07:20.882 --> 07:24.562
So Parliament decided that
they didn't want "no deal,"

07:24.722 --> 07:26.762
but they also didn't want
Theresa May's deal.

07:26.922 --> 07:29.402
So in another
non-binding wish lantern,

07:29.562 --> 07:34.082
they then resolved that May should ask
the EU for an extension until June 30th.

07:34.242 --> 07:36.362
What would they do
with that extra time?

07:36.522 --> 07:39.322
That's unclear, and also,
the EU would have to agree to it,

07:39.482 --> 07:41.882
all of which is so deeply
confusing and frustrating,

07:42.042 --> 07:45.162
even journalists were snapping
at cabinet ministers.

07:45.322 --> 07:49.722
Secretary of State, you know better
than I do that Parliament is for once

07:49.882 --> 07:51.962
deeply representative
of the country.

07:52.122 --> 07:53.522
It's completely asunder.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.682
Nobody in the country
knows what's going on.

07:55.842 --> 07:57.522
Nobody in there
knows what's going on.

07:57.682 --> 08:00.722
And you know nothing,
even inside the cabinet.

08:00.882 --> 08:03.202
The cabinet is at sea.
The country's at sea.

08:03.362 --> 08:06.042
- We are a laughingstock.
- Is that a question?

08:06.202 --> 08:09.762
No, no.
You know what? It's not.

08:09.922 --> 08:14.842
It's not actually a question,
so let me take another stab at one.

08:15.002 --> 08:18.162
You really fucked up, right?
See? There's a question.

08:18.322 --> 08:20.162
There's a question for you!

08:20.322 --> 08:23.042
The truth is, a bad Brexit outcome

08:23.202 --> 08:25.602
was guaranteed the minute
the vote went final.

08:25.762 --> 08:29.042
There are not, nor will there ever be
good Brexit options.

08:29.202 --> 08:32.642
So members of Parliament need to accept
their options now are limited,

08:32.802 --> 08:36.881
as this MP, who voted for May's deal,
seems to have done.

08:37.042 --> 08:38.922
We were just discussing
in my office

08:39.082 --> 08:41.562
how we would describe
the current situation,

08:41.722 --> 08:43.802
and using good old
Cumbrian terminology,

08:43.962 --> 08:46.442
we were really torn between
whether it's a pig's ear,

08:46.602 --> 08:48.562
a dog's dinner, or a cat's arse.

08:48.722 --> 08:50.642
Okay, okay. Okay.

08:50.802 --> 08:54.682
First, fuck the dog's dinner,
marry the cat's arse,

08:54.842 --> 08:56.282
and kill the pig's ear.

08:56.442 --> 08:59.562
It's easy. Unless, that is,
you're David Cameron,

08:59.722 --> 09:03.082
in which case, you marry the pig's ear,
'cause you've fucked his face.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.762
You make an honest hog
out of that swine corpse,

09:05.922 --> 09:09.282
'cause you're a good guy who's in no way
responsible for this mess.

09:09.442 --> 09:11.482
But I would actually argue that
that MP

09:11.642 --> 09:15.322
has inadvertently hit upon the perfect
metaphor for Britain's choices.

09:15.482 --> 09:18.802
The pig's ear is the decision to leave,
because it's absurd.

09:18.962 --> 09:21.802
The dog's dinner is the exit plan,
because it's distasteful,

09:21.962 --> 09:24.042
but we have to swallow it,
it's all we've got.

09:24.202 --> 09:26.882
And the cat's arse is the consequence
of what we've done,

09:27.042 --> 09:31.202
because it's shitty, but we'll have to
have it shoved in our faces repeatedly

09:31.362 --> 09:33.602
for a long fucking time to come.

09:33.762 --> 09:35.162
And now this.

09:35.322 --> 09:38.522
<i>And now, in honor</i>
<i>of St. Patrick's Day,</i>

09:38.682 --> 09:41.922
<i>Sean Hannity celebrates</i>
<i>his heritage.</i>

09:42.082 --> 09:44.882
Okay.
I'm hopefully optimistic.

09:45.042 --> 09:48.322
- I'm Irish. Don't worry, it's normal.
- Oh, you are.

09:48.482 --> 09:50.882
I like fear as a motivator.
And I'm Irish.

09:51.042 --> 09:53.162
I'm thinking the worst-case scenario.

09:53.322 --> 09:54.642
Maybe it's because I'm Irish,

09:54.802 --> 09:57.602
maybe 'cause I'm always
expecting the worst.

09:57.762 --> 10:00.082
My grandparents came
to this country from Ireland.

10:00.242 --> 10:02.842
All four of my grandparents
came from Ireland.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.722
What is an Irish seven course meal?

10:04.882 --> 10:06.882
- What?
- A six-pack and a potato.

10:07.042 --> 10:08.522
What's an Irish
seven course meal?

10:08.682 --> 10:10.802
- You tell me, bro.
- A six-pack and a potato.

10:10.962 --> 10:12.802
Seven course meal,
six-pack and a potato.

10:12.962 --> 10:15.042
Six-pack. Six-pack.
Six-pack and a potato.

10:15.202 --> 10:17.482
A six-pack and a potato.
I'd laugh.

10:17.642 --> 10:19.442
- That's funny.
- You never heard that?

10:19.602 --> 10:21.522
Excuse me.
No, I never heard it.

10:21.682 --> 10:23.682
You know what an Irish
seven course meal is?

10:23.842 --> 10:26.962
- A six-pack and a potato.
- Is that right?

10:27.122 --> 10:29.642
Seven course meal is
a six-pack and a potato.

10:29.802 --> 10:32.202
<i>A six-pack and a potato, okay?</i>

10:32.362 --> 10:35.162
<i>A six-pack and a potato.</i>

10:35.322 --> 10:36.722
That's funny.

10:39.202 --> 10:44.081
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns public shaming,

10:44.241 --> 10:47.401
or as we call it in England,
parenting.

10:47.561 --> 10:51.321
Thanks to the internet, it's never been
easier to pile onto a public shaming.

10:51.481 --> 10:54.121
In fact, it's now one of
America's favorite pastimes.

10:54.281 --> 10:56.521
A Wisconsin family's
photo shoot's gone viral,

10:56.681 --> 10:58.241
and it's sparking outrage online.

10:58.401 --> 11:01.081
A viral video leads to outrage
on Long Island.

11:01.241 --> 11:03.801
Now the outrage over
another viral video.

11:03.961 --> 11:06.121
The outrage machine
never seems to rest.

11:06.281 --> 11:08.281
As actress Sarah Michelle Gellar
found out,

11:08.441 --> 11:11.961
<i>some people online are just looking</i>
<i>for an excuse to be angry.</i>

11:12.121 --> 11:14.721
Wait, what did
Sarah Michelle Gellar do?

11:14.881 --> 11:17.241
I'm already so angry about it!

11:17.401 --> 11:20.241
Actually, don't tell me.
I just realized I don't care.

11:20.401 --> 11:23.361
The point is, this is a golden age
of internet shaming,

11:23.521 --> 11:25.201
and you've probably
participated in it

11:25.361 --> 11:28.401
if you've been mad at a potential
Oscar host with shitty tweets,

11:28.561 --> 11:31.361
a company who made a blackface shirt,
a beloved Irish actor

11:31.521 --> 11:33.321
who wanted to commit
a racist murder,

11:33.481 --> 11:35.681
and aquarium that called
an otter "thicc,"

11:35.841 --> 11:38.361
a gender reveal party
that started a wildfire,

11:38.521 --> 11:40.281
whoever attacked Jussie Smollett,

11:40.441 --> 11:44.201
whoever didn't believe Jussie Smollett,
and finally, Jussie Smollett.

11:44.361 --> 11:46.721
We're basically goldfish,
except instead of

11:46.881 --> 11:49.761
discovering a new castle in our bowl
every nine seconds

11:49.921 --> 11:52.801
we find something new
to be outraged about online.

11:52.961 --> 11:55.921
You may be expecting me to say
that all public shaming is bad,

11:56.081 --> 11:57.881
but I don't actually think that.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.921
When it's well-directed,
a lot of good can come out of it.

12:01.081 --> 12:02.961
If someone's caught
doing something racist

12:03.121 --> 12:06.281
or someone powerful behaves badly,
it can increase accountability.

12:06.441 --> 12:09.961
This week, it emerged that Tucker
Carlson, the answer to the question,

12:10.121 --> 12:12.681
"What if the sound 'thud'
grew a face?"

12:12.841 --> 12:16.641
had said some awful things
on a radio show a few years prior.

12:16.801 --> 12:21.281
And to hear Tucks tell it, he was
unfairly caught up in public shaming.

12:21.441 --> 12:25.681
The great American outrage machine
is a remarkable thing.

12:25.841 --> 12:29.481
One day you're having dinner with your
family, imagining everything's fine.

12:29.641 --> 12:33.121
The next, your phone is exploding
with calls from reporters.

12:33.281 --> 12:35.881
First, no one having dinner
with Tucker Carlson

12:36.041 --> 12:39.081
has ever imagined
everything was fine.

12:39.241 --> 12:40.921
Most people's answer to the question

12:41.081 --> 12:45.801
"If you could have dinner with anyone,
living or dead" is Tucker Carlson, dead.

12:45.961 --> 12:49.641
And if you look into why Tucker
was caught in that "outrage machine,"

12:49.801 --> 12:53.601
it's because he publicly called Iraqis
"semiliterate primitive monkeys,"

12:53.761 --> 12:56.241
compared women to dogs,
and basically said that

12:56.401 --> 12:58.401
Warren Jeffs,
who is serving a life sentence

12:58.561 --> 13:01.881
for the sexual assault of his underage
brides, wasn't that bad.

13:02.041 --> 13:05.841
Tucker refused to apologize and all week
long, there've been trending hashtags

13:06.001 --> 13:08.841
like "boycott Tucker Carlson,"
and "fire Tucker Carlson,"

13:09.001 --> 13:11.001
and "Tucker Carlson fucks
his Roomba."

13:11.161 --> 13:13.321
That one wasn't technically trending,

13:13.481 --> 13:16.961
but I have this weird feeling
that it will be in 20 minutes or so.

13:17.121 --> 13:21.361
And look, I would argue
that Tucker is actually

13:21.521 --> 13:24.281
a good example of an internet
pile-on being merited.

13:24.441 --> 13:26.881
He's a public figure,
he made his comments publicly,

13:27.041 --> 13:29.441
they are appalling,
and he's standing by them.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.801
But clearly,
it's not always that simple,

13:31.961 --> 13:34.481
because when misdirected,
internet pile-ons

13:34.641 --> 13:36.401
can completely destroy
people's lives.

13:36.561 --> 13:39.681
So tonight, let's try and talk about
the power of public shaming,

13:39.841 --> 13:43.361
because often it is not a famous figure
who's on the receiving end of it.

13:43.521 --> 13:47.521
On a seemingly daily basis, ordinary
people who did not ask for attention

13:47.681 --> 13:51.201
can get sucked into the spotlight,
like this woman did a few years ago.

13:51.361 --> 13:55.281
<i>They're calling her the Aunt From Hell</i>
<i>and the Auntie Christ.</i>

13:55.441 --> 13:57.961
An aunt files suit
against her 12-year-old nephew.

13:58.121 --> 14:01.161
She claims she broke her wrist
when he jumped into her arms.

14:01.321 --> 14:05.361
She sued her young nephew
for $127,000.

14:05.521 --> 14:10.041
That's right, $127,000 over a hug.

14:10.201 --> 14:12.801
Her defense was that
when she goes to a cocktail party,

14:12.961 --> 14:14.281
she actually said this,

14:14.441 --> 14:17.761
she can't hold the plate
when the hors d'oeuvres are passed.

14:17.921 --> 14:19.521
- Oh.
- Because of her wrist.

14:19.681 --> 14:23.641
That sounds terrible, although I'll say
this. I know this isn't the point,

14:23.801 --> 14:26.881
but everyone finds it difficult
to hold an hors d'oeuvres plate.

14:27.041 --> 14:29.441
You have a plate in one hand
and wine in the other.

14:29.601 --> 14:33.841
Do you grab food off the plate with your
teeth, like some kind of trained horse?

14:34.001 --> 14:37.361
Do you hold the wine in your armpit
and grab food with your other hand

14:37.521 --> 14:40.041
then spend the rest of the night
drinking armpit wine?

14:40.201 --> 14:41.601
It's an unsolvable puzzle.

14:41.761 --> 14:45.241
But look, it is pretty shitty
to force a 12-year-old boy

14:45.401 --> 14:47.800
to pay six figures for hugging you
enthusiastically.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.880
Which is, of course,
why she didn't actually do that.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.240
The real story is
much more complicated.

14:53.400 --> 14:57.080
Very basically, her health insurance
didn't cover her massive medical bills.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.600
So to cover her costs,

14:58.760 --> 15:01.720
she had to go through her relative's
homeowner's insurance.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.520
To do that, she had to name
a person in a lawsuit,

15:04.680 --> 15:07.720
even though the kid and his family
were completely fine with it,

15:07.880 --> 15:09.600
and they would not be
required to pay.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.360
She actually went on
"The Today Show"

15:11.520 --> 15:14.320
<i>to explain all of this</i>
<i>after the story blew up.</i>

15:14.480 --> 15:16.720
Unfortunately, it didn't seem
to undo the damage.

15:16.880 --> 15:20.080
Maybe because even while
she was discussing the actual facts,

15:20.240 --> 15:24.200
"The Today Show's" graphics read,
"Worst aunt ever speaks out."

15:24.360 --> 15:27.280
Which doesn't really help, does it?

15:27.440 --> 15:30.560
Meanwhile, she was being
relentlessly attacked on the internet,

15:30.720 --> 15:34.040
meaning anyone Googling her
in the future would likely be inundated

15:34.200 --> 15:37.400
by the inaccurate version of that story,
which, as she'll tell you,

15:37.560 --> 15:40.080
became a real problem when
she was looking for work.

15:40.240 --> 15:44.600
It was very difficult
to find another job.

15:44.760 --> 15:48.080
People reached out
and then canceled interviews

15:48.240 --> 15:50.920
or then said, "Oh, we've
changed our direction."

15:51.080 --> 15:53.440
I've taken--had to take certain measures

15:53.600 --> 15:57.600
in order to reestablish myself.

15:58.760 --> 16:02.280
And I have a refreshed identity.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.400
That's a pretty drastic
measure to have to take.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.720
So to help her move past this,
if you talk about the show tonight,

16:08.880 --> 16:11.960
remember to tag it with the hashtag
"just a normal aunt."

16:12.120 --> 16:13.840
Hashtag "aunt from not hell,"

16:14.000 --> 16:16.760
hashtag "Tucker Carlson
fucks his Roomba."

16:16.920 --> 16:20.840
And look, there was every
reason for her to believe

16:21.000 --> 16:22.920
that refreshing her identity
was necessary,

16:23.080 --> 16:27.320
because fully two months after she went
on TV to correct the record,

16:27.480 --> 16:29.960
Fox News was having this discussion.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.520
Hashtag "worst aunt ever."

16:32.680 --> 16:36.680
But I will tell you that she did then
come on to one of the media outlets

16:36.840 --> 16:39.640
and say that she needed--
she was injured, obviously,

16:39.800 --> 16:42.240
and wanted to sue
her homeowner's association,

16:42.400 --> 16:45.840
but had to--or homeowner's
insurance--and had to name him

16:46.000 --> 16:48.040
as the party and felt bad about it.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.640
By the way, she fell because he was
so excited to see her.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.360
- He jumped up in her arms.
- Right.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.200
"Auntie Jen, I love you!
I love you!"

16:59.600 --> 17:01.440
What are you doing there?

17:01.600 --> 17:04.240
This is the worst aunt ever.
But in all seriousness,

17:04.400 --> 17:07.599
she did the only thing she could have
done and feels bad about it.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.359
But the important thing here is,
she's the worst aunt ever and...

17:12.800 --> 17:16.839
Now, I am not saying those television
personalities are all terrible people.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.720
They just want to fill time more than
they want to say things that are true.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.680
But at some point
it's incumbent on everyone

17:23.839 --> 17:26.040
to consider both context
and consequences

17:26.200 --> 17:28.200
if you're going to pile on
in a shaming.

17:28.359 --> 17:30.760
And I'm not saying
that anything here is easy.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.560
For instance, did I just publicly shame
that lawyer in the last clip?

17:34.720 --> 17:39.000
Yeah, I probably did. And honestly,
I'm absolutely fine with that.

17:39.160 --> 17:43.480
I'm fine with calling him a human popped
collar whose every facial expression

17:43.640 --> 17:47.600
says, "I only wish 'Green Book'
had won more Oscars."

17:47.760 --> 17:49.600
And look-- look, let's be honest.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.960
We make fun of people constantly
on this show. It's a comedy show.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.800
Although, for what it is worth,
we do think,

17:56.960 --> 17:59.440
probably more carefully
than you might imagine,

17:59.600 --> 18:02.520
about who we're making fun of,
why we're doing it, and how.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.600
We ask ourselves questions like,
"Should we use their name?

18:05.760 --> 18:08.720
How much power do they have?"
and "Do they have a soul patch?"

18:08.880 --> 18:11.400
That last one can be
a real deal breaker.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.240
And I'm not saying
that we're perfect at all.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.600
You might disagree with choices
that we've made,

18:16.760 --> 18:18.680
but we've honestly thought about it.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.720
And sometimes the decision is difficult.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.200
Look at another major scandal
that broke this week

18:23.360 --> 18:25.440
concerning fraud in college admissions.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.920
<i>Actresses Felicity Huffman</i>
<i>and Lori Loughlin</i>

18:28.080 --> 18:32.520
<i>among 33 wealthy parents accused of</i>
<i>bribing coaches and administrators</i>

18:32.680 --> 18:35.080
<i>to get their kids</i>
<i>into elite universities.</i>

18:35.240 --> 18:37.560
<i>Loughlin and her husband</i>
<i>Mossimo Giannulli</i>

18:37.720 --> 18:39.840
<i>allegedly put up $1/2 million</i>

18:40.000 --> 18:42.240
<i>in exchange for getting</i>
<i>their two daughters</i>

18:42.400 --> 18:44.400
<i>recruited to the USC crew team,</i>

18:44.560 --> 18:47.040
<i>even though they did not</i>
<i>participate in crew.</i>

18:47.200 --> 18:50.240
Okay, that is such a weird story.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.719
I don't think anyone guessed that
the next celebrity scandal would be

18:53.879 --> 18:57.399
Aunt Becky from "Full House"
allegedly spends $1/2 million

18:57.559 --> 19:01.919
so a guy will pretend her daughters
are good at boats.

19:02.079 --> 19:05.559
And incidentally, if that's all true,
"worst aunt ever."

19:05.719 --> 19:11.759
Now, I have got-- I have no problem--
the truth is, I've got no problem

19:11.919 --> 19:14.079
making fun of the parents
accused of doing that

19:14.239 --> 19:15.959
or the guy who ran that service.

19:16.119 --> 19:18.639
Where it gets more complicated
is with the kids.

19:18.799 --> 19:20.759
How much is it fair
to make fun of them?

19:20.919 --> 19:25.359
Well, I would argue that one of them,
Olivia Jade, is a public figure.

19:25.519 --> 19:28.399
She has nearly 1 1/2 million
followers on Instagram

19:28.559 --> 19:30.359
and has worked with
all these companies.

19:30.519 --> 19:32.759
She's actively made money
off her brand

19:32.919 --> 19:36.839
as a fun, relatable college student,
releasing videos like this.

19:36.999 --> 19:39.239
I don't know how much of school
I'm gonna attend,

19:39.399 --> 19:43.559
but I do want the experience
of, like, game days, partying...

19:43.719 --> 19:46.359
I don't really care about school,
as you all know.

19:46.519 --> 19:51.519
Okay, so even before what we learned
this week, that was a little tone-deaf,

19:51.679 --> 19:55.719
although not quite as tone-deaf as this
sponsored post she made for Amazon,

19:55.879 --> 20:00.599
in which she's decorated her dorm room
at USC with the letters "OJ."

20:00.759 --> 20:05.599
And if you don't see a connection
between the letters OJ and USC,

20:05.759 --> 20:08.719
maybe it should cost $1/2 million
to get you in there.

20:08.879 --> 20:12.839
Now, I'm comfortable
making those jokes.

20:12.999 --> 20:16.239
Am I comfortable with the whole internet
piling on her?

20:16.399 --> 20:19.679
Honestly, that kind of depends on how
and for how long.

20:19.839 --> 20:22.679
If it's death threats and vile comments,
then of course not.

20:22.839 --> 20:25.279
If it defines her forever,
that seems unfair.

20:25.439 --> 20:27.919
The window for making fun of her
is probably closing,

20:28.079 --> 20:30.879
although it should stay open just enough
for me to tell you

20:31.039 --> 20:33.519
one person went to
her Sephora makeup product page

20:33.679 --> 20:35.239
and left a one-star review reading,

20:35.399 --> 20:38.519
"I thought this would give me
the 'just came from crew practice,'

20:38.679 --> 20:42.439
"'spent hours rowing on the lake' glow.
Turns out it was all a sham!"

20:42.599 --> 20:45.479
Because that was excellent.

20:45.639 --> 20:47.599
Just mwah.

20:47.759 --> 20:51.959
But look, that is
the difficult thing here.

20:52.119 --> 20:55.079
When joining in a pile-on,
there's a lot to take into account.

20:55.239 --> 20:57.919
And when millions of people
all feel the need to weigh in

20:58.079 --> 20:59.879
and do it potentially for years,

21:00.039 --> 21:03.319
the punishment can be vastly
disproportionate to the offense.

21:03.479 --> 21:06.439
And perhaps the best example
of this is Monica Lewinsky.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.759
Two decades ago, this country
put her through hell,

21:09.919 --> 21:11.799
as she'll be the first to tell you.

21:11.959 --> 21:16.599
Overnight, I went from being
a completely private figure

21:16.759 --> 21:21.479
to a publically humiliated one
worldwide.

21:21.679 --> 21:25.879
I was patient zero of losing
a personal reputation

21:26.039 --> 21:29.679
on a global scale
almost instantaneously.

21:29.839 --> 21:31.999
Wow.
That has to be terrifying.

21:32.159 --> 21:34.399
Although, in fairness,
almost everything is scary

21:34.559 --> 21:37.079
when you add the phrase
"on a global scale."

21:37.239 --> 21:38.799
If I said, "Karen's ophthalmologist

21:38.959 --> 21:42.239
"says she's gonna need reading glasses
on a global scale,"

21:42.399 --> 21:46.319
you would rightly think, "What the fuck
is going on with Karen's eyes?"

21:46.479 --> 21:47.879
But look, she's not wrong.

21:48.039 --> 21:50.239
And if you're hazy on
the Monica Lewinsky story,

21:50.399 --> 21:54.439
at 22, she and President Clinton began
a relationship that, long story short,

21:54.599 --> 21:56.759
ended up with graphic details
being made public

21:56.919 --> 21:59.319
through the report
by independent counsel Ken Starr.

21:59.479 --> 22:02.999
And it is impossible to overstate
just how globally famous

22:03.159 --> 22:05.599
Monica and private details
of her life became.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.359
The media obsessed over
every angle of her story,

22:08.519 --> 22:10.239
from tabloid stories like these,

22:10.399 --> 22:14.479
to cartoons where microphones pointed
at her face were replaced with penises,

22:14.639 --> 22:16.519
to endless late night comedy jokes.

22:16.679 --> 22:19.199
Look, my hands are not
clean here, either.

22:19.359 --> 22:21.999
I wasn't in the U.S. then,
but ten years after the fact,

22:22.159 --> 22:25.679
I was in a "Daily Show" piece marking
the 10th anniversary of the scandal

22:25.839 --> 22:30.319
above a graphic reading "Ten suckin'
years," which is gross. It's gross.

22:30.479 --> 22:33.519
And many comedians have since
publically expressed regret

22:33.679 --> 22:36.199
about things they said,
although one who hasn't,

22:36.359 --> 22:39.639
and who was among the most relentless,
was Jay Leno.

22:39.799 --> 22:41.479
Let's see what's going on with Monica

22:41.639 --> 22:44.599
or, as President Clinton
calls her, "my little humidor."

22:44.759 --> 22:46.559
1 million samples of DNA.

22:46.719 --> 22:48.839
The largest collection of DNA
in the world,

22:48.999 --> 22:50.719
not counting Monica Lewinsky's closet.

22:50.879 --> 22:52.999
And the humidity--
man, I'll tell you,

22:53.159 --> 22:57.278
people's clothes are stickier than
Monica Lewinsky's. Man, it was just...

22:57.438 --> 23:00.878
You can't get away without one of these:
Lewinsky back on her feet.

23:01.038 --> 23:02.438
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

23:02.598 --> 23:04.918
And the Grammy
for Best Organ Recital

23:05.078 --> 23:08.798
went to Monica Lewinsky,
ladies and gentlemen.

23:08.958 --> 23:13.158
Those jokes have not dated well
in any sense of the word.

23:13.318 --> 23:15.918
And they're pretty rough,
especially coming from a guy

23:16.078 --> 23:18.718
who just this week complained
about late night TV,

23:18.878 --> 23:21.558
saying he'd like to see
"a bit of civility come back."

23:21.718 --> 23:24.318
Like that time that
he did a bit with a fake book

23:24.478 --> 23:26.958
about Lewinsky titled,
"The Slut in the Hat."

23:27.118 --> 23:30.558
And if that's what he means by civility,
may I offer my new book,

23:30.718 --> 23:33.238
"Oh, the Places You Can
Go Fuck Yourself, Jay Leno!"

23:33.398 --> 23:35.758
Look--look how civil I'm being.

23:35.918 --> 23:38.238
Look how civil this is.

23:38.398 --> 23:42.838
Given that, it's frankly a miracle that
Lewinsky seems to have emerged

23:42.998 --> 23:45.998
with her sense of humor,
because when someone recently tweeted,

23:46.158 --> 23:48.158
"I don't know who
Monica Lewinsky is,"

23:48.318 --> 23:52.678
she replied, "I'm the chick
from over 125 rap songs,"

23:52.838 --> 23:56.238
which is both very funny
and also technically true,

23:56.398 --> 23:58.798
because she's referenced
in all these songs.

23:58.958 --> 24:02.598
We actually found 193 of them,
and that is-- and this may shock you--

24:02.758 --> 24:05.238
significantly more rap songs
than have mentioned me.

24:05.398 --> 24:08.598
And to be honest, that kind of feels
like a personal slight.

24:08.758 --> 24:11.118
You know what's an easy name to rhyme?
John.

24:11.278 --> 24:14.038
I'll show you:
begone, swan, Louis Vuitton,

24:14.198 --> 24:16.838
beef bourguignon,
lots of options there.

24:16.998 --> 24:19.478
You know what's also
pretty tight rhyme-wise? Oliver.

24:19.638 --> 24:21.398
Don't want a piece, I want all of her.

24:21.558 --> 24:23.318
Hittin' all the spots like John Oliver.

24:23.478 --> 24:25.438
You can have that for free, rappers.

24:25.598 --> 24:29.038
You know what rhymes with Lewinsky?
Almost nothing.

24:29.198 --> 24:32.398
But look, the point isn't that
I should be in more rap songs,

24:32.558 --> 24:34.558
although I absolutely should.

24:34.718 --> 24:37.398
It's that Lewinsky went through
absolute hell

24:37.558 --> 24:39.878
to get to the point where
she could make that joke

24:40.038 --> 24:41.878
about being the woman
from the rap songs.

24:42.038 --> 24:44.518
And it can be easy to forget
just how ferocious

24:44.678 --> 24:47.038
and devastating
the public attention was.

24:47.998 --> 24:50.118
Hey, pal, get your arms off her!

24:50.278 --> 24:53.638
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>how to begin to describe...</i>

24:55.438 --> 24:58.798
<i>What it was.</i>
<i>But it was to see my face on TV,</i>

24:58.958 --> 25:03.318
<i>to--to read my name</i>
<i>in the newspaper.</i>

25:03.478 --> 25:08.798
People have no idea what--

25:08.958 --> 25:10.718
what this has done.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.558
What this has done.

25:13.718 --> 25:16.358
Behind the name Monica Lewinsky,

25:16.518 --> 25:19.558
there's a person
and there is a family

25:19.718 --> 25:23.598
and there has been so much pain
that has been caused by all this.

25:23.758 --> 25:26.598
And it is...

25:26.758 --> 25:29.678
It was so...

25:31.598 --> 25:34.638
Destructive, was so destructive.

25:35.398 --> 25:38.078
That's horrifying,
and it's impossible to imagine

25:38.238 --> 25:41.358
how bad that was,
but for a second, just try.

25:41.518 --> 25:43.638
Think of the dumbest thing
you did in youth.

25:43.798 --> 25:47.198
Not the dumbest thing you got caught
doing, the dumbest thing you did.

25:47.358 --> 25:49.158
The thing you stole, or cheated on,

25:49.318 --> 25:52.158
or accidentally sexted,
and again, I am sorry, Mom.

25:52.318 --> 25:55.758
Now, imagine hearing about that

25:55.918 --> 25:58.438
every single day for decades on end.

25:58.598 --> 26:01.438
It's a little bit of what it was like
to be Monica Lewinsky.

26:01.598 --> 26:05.438
And I know everything about the subject
of public shaming is complicated.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.078
But Monica Lewinsky might be
the perfect person

26:08.238 --> 26:10.798
to remind all of us
what the consequences can be

26:10.958 --> 26:13.358
to a misdirected flood
of public anger.

26:13.518 --> 26:16.798
I know this because I sat down
with Monica earlier this week,

26:16.958 --> 26:18.358
and this is what happened.

26:18.518 --> 26:22.358
<i>21 years ago, Monica Lewinsky</i>
<i>was at the center of a media frenzy.</i>

26:22.518 --> 26:25.798
<i>In recent years, she's reemerged</i>
<i>as a major voice on online shaming</i>

26:25.958 --> 26:27.438
<i>and anti-bullying initiatives.</i>

26:27.598 --> 26:29.558
<i>And she was kind enough</i>
<i>to sit down with me</i>

26:29.718 --> 26:32.238
<i>in a fancy apartment</i>
<i>that neither of us live in.</i>

26:32.398 --> 26:35.398
So in the last few years,
you've been doing a lot of work

26:35.558 --> 26:37.558
related to bullying
and people being shamed.

26:37.718 --> 26:40.518
- You think the issue has gotten worse?
- Absolutely.

26:40.678 --> 26:44.718
I think that with the advent of the
internet and, of course, social media,

26:44.878 --> 26:46.998
we now have situations

26:47.158 --> 26:49.998
where it's exacerbated
beyond, I think,

26:50.158 --> 26:52.238
what anybody could have imagined.

26:52.398 --> 26:55.078
And the anonymity that comes with that,

26:55.238 --> 26:58.758
that sort of unleashed
these whole new personas for people.

26:58.918 --> 27:02.197
Yeah, it's sad, isn't it?
If you have a chance to come up with

27:02.357 --> 27:06.517
a second persona, you decide to come up
with one that's a fucking monster.

27:06.677 --> 27:07.997
Yeah, exactly.

27:08.157 --> 27:09.797
"How much of an asshole can I be?"

27:09.957 --> 27:14.197
"I'm gonna amplify every worst aspect
of my personality by 100."

27:14.357 --> 27:18.277
Would you agree that somewhere
on the spectrum of shame,

27:18.437 --> 27:20.557
there can be positive effects to it?

27:20.717 --> 27:22.757
I mean people
whose bad behavior hurts others

27:22.917 --> 27:25.397
and who might not change it
without public attention.

27:25.557 --> 27:27.077
Yeah, it's interesting.

27:27.237 --> 27:29.397
I've spent a lot of time
thinking about this.

27:29.557 --> 27:34.117
And we tend to look at it as this kind
of, um, like a binary question, right?

27:34.277 --> 27:35.997
Should we public shame
or shouldn't we?

27:36.157 --> 27:39.157
I do think there's a spectrum
of behavior

27:39.317 --> 27:42.877
on which we could kind of
sort of judge as a society.

27:43.037 --> 27:44.877
Is this where shaming is effective

27:45.037 --> 27:48.037
to change social behavior
or is it damaging?

27:48.197 --> 27:51.037
You were on the receiving end
of one of the worst

27:51.197 --> 27:53.557
internet-fueled public shamings
of all time,

27:53.717 --> 27:56.117
- ...and hopefully, in a way, ever.
- Mm-hmm.

27:56.277 --> 27:59.277
How the fuck
did you get through that?

27:59.437 --> 28:03.877
Yeah. I, um...
I don't actually know. You know?

28:04.037 --> 28:06.117
- Really?
- I mean, it was a shitstorm.

28:06.277 --> 28:09.597
It was an avalanche
of pain and humiliation,

28:09.757 --> 28:14.157
and obviously, I could not have gotten
through it without my family.

28:14.317 --> 28:17.277
And when I was allowed to talk
to my friends, my friends, too.

28:17.437 --> 28:20.597
And I think at 24 years old,

28:20.757 --> 28:22.917
it was, you know,

28:23.077 --> 28:27.597
really hard to hold on
to a shred of dignity

28:27.757 --> 28:31.357
or self-esteem when, you know,

28:31.517 --> 28:34.197
you're the butt of so many jokes
and being misunderstood.

28:34.357 --> 28:37.437
Right, as everything escalated,
all the reaction to it,

28:37.597 --> 28:41.677
what's it like to see this character
of yourself that has your face and name,

28:41.837 --> 28:44.877
but bears less and less
relevance to who you actually are?

28:45.037 --> 28:48.317
Yeah, it was so bizarre.
I mean, it was just--it was...

28:48.477 --> 28:52.677
I say extraordinary not with
any positive connotation.

28:52.837 --> 28:55.637
And I think it was not only
just the slut-shaming,

28:55.797 --> 28:59.597
not only, you know, having had
an intimate relationship

28:59.757 --> 29:02.077
with someone who is now
describing me in way

29:02.237 --> 29:04.757
that no young woman
would want to be described.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.437
- Sure.
- There was just also my looks.

29:07.597 --> 29:10.997
I, you know, was very about
the touch-ups and the makeup,

29:11.157 --> 29:13.197
'cause I'm--like,
part of my vanity now

29:13.357 --> 29:18.357
comes from just the wound
of having been made fun of

29:18.517 --> 29:21.517
for my weight, for, you know,

29:21.677 --> 29:24.037
people saying I was unattractive.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.317
And it was terrifying,
not only because

29:26.477 --> 29:29.357
I was watching myself

29:29.517 --> 29:32.037
or this version of myself
running away from me.

29:32.197 --> 29:35.237
I mean, stolen. My identity was stolen
in a different way.

29:35.397 --> 29:37.117
Not to say that I wasn't flawed,

29:37.277 --> 29:39.837
that I didn't make mistakes,
or do stupid things,

29:39.997 --> 29:41.677
or say stupid things,
of course I did.

29:41.837 --> 29:44.237
- You were 22.
- Right, so...

29:44.397 --> 29:48.357
Every 22-year-old
is some version of an idiot.

29:48.517 --> 29:51.197
You just lost a lot
of viewers, John.

29:51.357 --> 29:52.797
- So...
- That's true.

29:52.957 --> 29:54.357
- Just let me--
- Cut that.

29:54.517 --> 29:57.197
Not you. Whichever 22-year-old
is listening now, not you.

29:57.357 --> 30:00.597
Not you.
But--so I mean, it's not--

30:00.757 --> 30:03.997
it's not like I was this,
you know, perfect angel, right?

30:04.157 --> 30:07.717
But I watched
this sort of deconstruction of me

30:07.877 --> 30:11.117
and rebuilding of me.
It's like a transformer, almost.

30:11.277 --> 30:15.117
Many victims of public shaming say it
affects their ability to earn a living.

30:15.277 --> 30:17.757
- Did that happen to you?
- Oh, 150%.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.357
I mean, I couldn't get a job.

30:20.517 --> 30:22.997
Actually, it was, you know,
it was interesting,

30:23.157 --> 30:27.157
because I went to graduate school
in 2005 and graduated in 2006,

30:27.317 --> 30:30.397
and I thought, "Oh, okay,
now I will begin my life."

30:30.557 --> 30:33.237
I will now put being
"Monica Lewinsky" behind me

30:33.397 --> 30:36.677
and move on to be
so-and-so's employee.

30:36.837 --> 30:39.277
And when I couldn't
find a job, you know,

30:39.437 --> 30:41.917
either someone offered me
a job for the wrong reasons

30:42.077 --> 30:43.957
like, "Oh, you'll be coming
to our events.

30:44.117 --> 30:47.077
That's your job, and there's
media there," you know?

30:47.237 --> 30:48.757
Or it's people saying to me,

30:48.917 --> 30:53.437
the opposite: "Could you get a letter
of indemnification from the Clintons?"

30:53.597 --> 30:56.877
"We rely on government money
and Hillary might be president."

30:57.037 --> 31:03.516
So I mean, there was this wide range
of not being able to support myself

31:03.676 --> 31:07.236
and also have a purpose,
which is equally important,

31:07.396 --> 31:11.236
to feel that you matter in some way.

31:11.396 --> 31:13.876
Is it tough sometimes to get through--

31:14.036 --> 31:16.676
- A typical day?
- Yes. The answer is yes.

31:16.836 --> 31:19.036
Yes, it is tough anytime.
Sorry.

31:19.196 --> 31:22.676
That's probably a fair response
to basically most of the things here.

31:22.836 --> 31:25.276
Is it tough sometimes
to get through a typical day

31:25.436 --> 31:26.876
without having to deal with this?

31:27.036 --> 31:30.356
'Cause the ubiquity of references to you
is incredible.

31:30.516 --> 31:33.996
Yeah, it's insane.
I think, you know, and in part,

31:34.156 --> 31:37.396
a lot of that happened
because of this, you know,

31:37.556 --> 31:39.156
sexist, really, thing that happened,

31:39.316 --> 31:42.596
which is that the scandal was named
after me, became named after me.

31:42.756 --> 31:45.116
It meant that anytime that
this has been referenced

31:45.276 --> 31:48.956
every single day, every single day
in the past 20 years--

31:49.116 --> 31:51.356
so it may not be
a direct reference to me,

31:51.516 --> 31:55.036
but because the investigation
and the scandal has my name,

31:55.196 --> 31:57.076
I'm then therefore attached to it.

31:57.236 --> 32:00.996
- Did you consider changing your name?
- There were several reasons I didn't.

32:01.156 --> 32:04.676
First of all, I don't think
that it really would have worked.

32:04.836 --> 32:07.716
Like, when I was job hunting,
people even suggested,

32:07.876 --> 32:10.836
"Why don't you put a different name
on your CV when you're..."

32:10.996 --> 32:13.996
I thought, so I'm gonna walk
into an office for an interview,

32:14.156 --> 32:16.156
and the person's gonna be like,
"What?

32:16.316 --> 32:18.156
That person looks like
Monica Lewinsky."

32:18.316 --> 32:22.076
And be wondering, and you're starting
a professional relationship on a lie.

32:22.236 --> 32:23.596
So there's not that.

32:23.756 --> 32:27.276
And then lastly,
I think it was also a principle.

32:27.436 --> 32:29.836
I mean Bill Clinton
didn't have to change his name.

32:29.996 --> 32:33.636
Nobody's ever asked him,
did he think he should change his name.

32:33.796 --> 32:38.036
And so I think that that was
an important statement, you know?

32:38.196 --> 32:41.956
I'm not proud of all of the choices
I've made in my life,

32:42.116 --> 32:45.396
but I'm proud of the person I am.
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

32:45.556 --> 32:50.916
And I think that it'is-- as hard as it's
been to have that last name sometimes

32:51.076 --> 32:53.636
and the pain that I have felt
of what it's meant

32:53.796 --> 32:58.596
for the other people in my family
who have that last name...

32:58.756 --> 33:00.476
I am glad I didn't change it.

33:00.636 --> 33:04.356
I definitely don't have your courage
or strength of character--

33:04.516 --> 33:06.356
Honestly, I believe you don't know that.

33:06.516 --> 33:11.556
Oh, no, I already have a mental list
of fake names that I'm going to do.

33:11.716 --> 33:15.476
Alvin, I like... It's not a great name,
but I think I can carry it off.

33:15.636 --> 33:17.996
No, you actually could
carry off Alvin.

33:18.156 --> 33:20.716
Thank you, Monica.
I think I could too.

33:20.876 --> 33:22.476
But I don't know about
Alvin Oliver.

33:22.636 --> 33:24.876
- That's a lot.
- True. That's not great.

33:25.036 --> 33:30.116
My second one was Jacks, no surname,
no explanation, just Jacks.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.956
I like that.
I could get behind that one.

33:33.116 --> 33:35.836
So let's talk a bit about,
like, laughing.

33:35.996 --> 33:37.996
You joke about your experiences.

33:38.156 --> 33:41.316
How long was it
before you could do that?

33:41.476 --> 33:43.916
I think there were stages,
you know,

33:44.076 --> 33:46.596
or things that have happened
a couple years ago.

33:46.756 --> 33:49.956
A friend of mine had--
she and her friend

33:50.116 --> 33:54.836
had a 25th friend-iversary party,
and they had met in the '90s.

33:54.996 --> 33:57.236
So this party that they had
for all their friends

33:57.396 --> 34:00.076
to celebrate their friendship,
started in the '90s,

34:00.236 --> 34:03.476
meant everybody had to come
dressed from the '90s.

34:03.636 --> 34:05.996
I was like, "Oh, shit," you know.

34:06.156 --> 34:09.795
So I just thought, "Okay," you know.

34:09.956 --> 34:12.636
So for the first time
in about 18 years,

34:12.795 --> 34:16.795
I donned a black beret
and went to my friend's party.

34:16.956 --> 34:20.036
You know, in part,
'cause I thought it was funny.

34:20.196 --> 34:22.116
- Oh, it's definitely funny.
- Right.

34:22.275 --> 34:26.596
Is that not a marker for actually having
come a long way, though?

34:26.755 --> 34:30.876
That you're able to actively
participate in humor

34:31.036 --> 34:32.556
connected to what
you went through,

34:32.716 --> 34:35.356
which, again, to reiterate,
was clearly awful.

34:35.516 --> 34:39.436
Yeah.
Like, beret things, I can laugh at.

34:39.596 --> 34:43.356
Other item of clothing, jokes,
not as much.

34:43.516 --> 34:46.196
What is your experience
of the internet now?

34:46.356 --> 34:49.275
'Cause you're on Twitter now,
and you're very funny on there.

34:49.436 --> 34:52.676
- Thank you.
- So how did you decide to go on it?

34:52.835 --> 34:55.636
I guess some of the times
I get really deflated

34:55.795 --> 35:00.316
watching you tweet something funny and
making the mistake of scrolling down.

35:00.476 --> 35:03.356
- Oh, yeah.
- It can become a sewer pretty fast.

35:03.516 --> 35:08.115
Yeah, it can. I mean, I get a lot of
empowerment out of blocking people.

35:08.275 --> 35:10.995
I wish people would not say
shitty things, but they do.

35:11.155 --> 35:12.595
- Right?
- Sure.

35:12.755 --> 35:15.675
And literally to me, it's like,
when I block someone,

35:15.835 --> 35:17.595
- I'm, like, going...
- Oh, really?

35:17.755 --> 35:19.435
That's what it feels like for me.

35:19.595 --> 35:22.315
I'm basically telling someone
to fuck off. It feels great.

35:22.475 --> 35:24.275
I wish they hadn't said something

35:24.435 --> 35:26.115
that would make me want
to block them,

35:26.275 --> 35:28.755
but blocking is
unbelievably empowering.

35:28.915 --> 35:33.235
Actually, I was lucky in some ways
that social media wasn't around.

35:33.395 --> 35:35.955
I think that would have made it worse
in some ways--

35:36.115 --> 35:37.835
- Could it have made it worse?
- Well--

35:37.995 --> 35:40.475
Have you not maxed out
how bad it could be?

35:40.635 --> 35:42.995
Do you really think it could
have got worse? Maybe.

35:43.155 --> 35:44.875
You know what? I don't know.

35:45.035 --> 35:48.955
It might have been worse in the sense
that there certainly would have been

35:49.115 --> 35:51.195
a lot more opinions
that were out there.

35:51.355 --> 35:54.235
But where it may have been
better would have been that,

35:54.395 --> 35:57.515
I think, I would have
heard some support from people.

35:57.675 --> 35:59.675
It might've been
a bit more balanced.

35:59.835 --> 36:02.755
So would it have been really
meaningful to you, at the time,

36:02.915 --> 36:06.595
had social media been around just
to have a stranger tweet something like,

36:06.755 --> 36:08.995
"I think what you're going
through is bullshit"?

36:09.155 --> 36:12.995
Yeah, yeah, it would.
Absolutely.

36:13.155 --> 36:14.955
Because one of the things
that happens

36:15.115 --> 36:18.835
with these kinds of experiences
is that you start to disappear.

36:18.995 --> 36:20.755
You start to feel like
you don't matter.

36:20.915 --> 36:23.795
And I think that when
somebody sees you,

36:23.955 --> 36:28.235
you know, and just acknowledges
your humanity in the smallest way,

36:28.395 --> 36:30.035
it can make
a world of difference.

36:30.195 --> 36:33.995
And you don't know, it could help save
someone's life, and that's important.

36:34.155 --> 36:36.075
What would your advice be to someone

36:36.235 --> 36:39.875
who's either in the eye right now
of the storm of public shaming

36:40.035 --> 36:42.355
or a kid who's being humiliated
at school, online?

36:42.515 --> 36:44.075
Anything you'd be able to tell them

36:44.235 --> 36:46.915
from your personal experience
that nobody else could?

36:47.075 --> 36:51.315
The first thing I'd probably say is that
you can get through it, move past it.

36:51.475 --> 36:53.835
I know it feels like
in this one moment

36:53.995 --> 36:58.595
that your life will forever be defined
by this, but it won't.

36:58.755 --> 37:00.075
And it may be hard.

37:00.235 --> 37:03.315
It may take more time
than you ever could have imagined,

37:03.475 --> 37:05.795
but you can move past
something like this.

37:05.955 --> 37:08.395
Monica Lewinsky,
thanks a lot for talking with me.

37:08.555 --> 37:11.915
Thank you, Alvin Oliver.
No, I'm kidding, sorry.

37:12.075 --> 37:13.755
Or Jacks.

37:15.195 --> 37:16.915
That's our show.
Thanks for watching.

37:17.075 --> 37:20.115
We're off next week, back after that.
Good night!
