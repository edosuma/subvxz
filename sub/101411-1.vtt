M_I_SForEver

00:29.081 --> 00:31.982
Ah!

00:32.015 --> 00:34.115
Ah...

01:12.716 --> 01:15.015
Mm-hmm...

01:15.048 --> 01:16.750
Mm...

01:19.782 --> 01:21.616
Ahem.

01:21.649 --> 01:24.281
Professor Juan.

01:24.314 --> 01:26.648
Professor Juan.

01:26.681 --> 01:30.114
- Professor Juan!
- Oh! Sorry!

01:30.147 --> 01:32.949
I couldn't hear you over my crunching.

01:32.982 --> 01:34.682
It's all right.

01:34.716 --> 01:37.181
I'm going to pick up
some food, my treat.

01:37.214 --> 01:38.281
You want the same
as last night?

01:38.314 --> 01:40.081
No, I'm not that hungry.

01:40.115 --> 01:43.848
Just bring me some tacos,
and two extra-large enchiladas

01:43.881 --> 01:47.049
and a chimichanga
and a few tostadas.

01:47.082 --> 01:52.115
No problem. And keep an eye on the
atomic particle reactor while I'm gone.

01:52.148 --> 01:54.748
Everything is safe with me.
Oh, oh, and...

01:54.781 --> 01:58.583
I know, I know.
"Don't forget the salsa."

02:07.181 --> 02:09.281
Ay, ay...

02:14.615 --> 02:16.282
Oh!

02:16.315 --> 02:17.982
Oh!

02:18.015 --> 02:19.850
Ah!

02:43.848 --> 02:48.816
Welcome to the Greenwood
Public School Science Battle!

02:52.748 --> 02:54.682
Photosynthesis?

02:54.716 --> 02:57.616
Ugh! That's so boring!

02:57.648 --> 02:58.648
Next!

03:00.048 --> 03:01.749
Next!

03:03.047 --> 03:04.049
Next!

03:06.915 --> 03:09.214
Get back here!

03:09.248 --> 03:13.716
Otto! Sit! Stay!

03:13.749 --> 03:16.349
Stop!

03:16.382 --> 03:19.715
Watch where you're going, Einstein.

03:19.749 --> 03:22.049
You know, calling someone
Einstein is a compliment.

03:24.716 --> 03:27.316
Ha! Ha!
Two for flinching!

03:34.847 --> 03:38.181
Up next is
Danny Dawkins

03:38.214 --> 03:40.847
And...

03:40.881 --> 03:42.682
- Ahem.
- Where's your partner?

03:42.715 --> 03:45.648
No partner.
I'm a solo operator.

03:45.682 --> 03:47.583
That's 'cause
he has no friends!

03:49.281 --> 03:52.282
They say the best inventions

03:52.314 --> 03:54.881
come from solving a problem, right?

03:54.915 --> 03:55.782
I suppose.

03:55.816 --> 03:58.649
Well, Otto has fleas,

03:58.682 --> 04:00.182
and he hates
being shampooed.

04:00.215 --> 04:03.583
So I invented a Nano-Bot

04:03.616 --> 04:06.082
to go in and deal with them
face to face.

04:12.749 --> 04:14.583
Huh? Huh?

04:28.748 --> 04:30.049
Have a look
through the microscope,

04:30.081 --> 04:31.582
you can see
my bot in action!

04:39.014 --> 04:40.815
I don't see
what the big deal is.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.048
That's because it's
a small deal!

04:43.082 --> 04:46.049
It's a Nano-Bot! It uses liquid
nitrogen to freeze the fleas...

04:47.748 --> 04:49.648
Next time,

04:49.682 --> 04:51.948
try to make
your project more visual.

04:51.981 --> 04:55.214
Nice one, loser!

04:55.248 --> 04:57.949
What do we have here?

04:57.982 --> 04:59.650
A volcano!

05:07.982 --> 05:11.149
Volcano!

05:11.181 --> 05:13.682
Now that was entertaining!

05:18.114 --> 05:21.914
I think we have
our Science Battle winner!

05:21.947 --> 05:23.114
Volcano!

05:26.747 --> 05:30.048
- Good work, sweetie.
- Thanks, Mom!

05:36.014 --> 05:38.649
I thought this prize
was for the best scientist,

05:38.681 --> 05:41.114
not the most obnoxious
mama's boy.

05:41.147 --> 05:43.781
What did you say
about my mom?

05:43.814 --> 05:45.315
Get him!

05:54.081 --> 05:55.281
Hiya!

05:55.315 --> 05:56.650
Shh.

05:57.981 --> 05:59.248
Ha!

06:02.382 --> 06:03.715
Ha!

06:03.748 --> 06:04.882
Come on, Danny!

06:04.915 --> 06:06.583
You can't hide from us.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.049
You know the rules.

06:08.081 --> 06:10.715
If you run away,
it only makes it worse!

06:10.748 --> 06:11.982
Shh.

06:15.682 --> 06:16.747
Don't!

06:21.848 --> 06:23.781
Yeah.

06:25.615 --> 06:26.282
Huh?

06:32.681 --> 06:33.882
Huh?

06:40.082 --> 06:43.049
They won't be
bothering you anymore.

06:44.247 --> 06:46.014
Wow. That thing
is incredible!

06:46.048 --> 06:48.682
Of course it is.
I invented it.

06:48.715 --> 06:50.315
My name is Miss Evans.

06:50.349 --> 06:52.982
I'm the principal
at Cranston Academy,

06:53.014 --> 06:55.949
a secret boarding school
for geniuses.

06:55.982 --> 06:59.149
I have a private matter
to discuss with you.

06:59.181 --> 07:02.049
It doesn't get
more private than this.

07:02.082 --> 07:04.781
We've been following your
academic progress for years,

07:04.815 --> 07:07.015
and think
that you would be...

07:07.048 --> 07:10.115
better appreciated
elsewhere.

07:10.147 --> 07:11.847
You think? Huh?

07:11.880 --> 07:15.248
We'd like to offer you a
full scholarship to Cranston.

07:20.914 --> 07:25.583
Whoa!

07:25.615 --> 07:29.714
<i>Welcome
to Cranston Academy!</i>

07:29.747 --> 07:32.181
Oh! Ah!

07:32.215 --> 07:35.049
<i>At my old school, they said that
learning wasn't rocket science.</i>

07:35.081 --> 07:37.714
<i>But at Cranston, it is!</i>

07:37.748 --> 07:40.349
<i>Cranston will help you
unlock your full potential.</i>

07:40.381 --> 07:43.015
<i>You can let
your imagination run wild,</i>

07:43.048 --> 07:46.015
<i>with everything you need to
succeed right at your fingertips</i>

07:46.048 --> 07:50.215
<i>Come to Cranston, and you could
be the next Edward Fizzerton!</i>

07:50.248 --> 07:53.215
We want you
to come to Cranston!

07:56.214 --> 07:59.981
Under our guidance, I think
you could do great things.

08:00.015 --> 08:02.949
So I have to decide between
staying at my current school,

08:02.981 --> 08:05.949
where I'm majoring in "trying not
to get flushed down the toilet,"

08:05.982 --> 08:09.282
or take a full scholarship to a place
with the word "genius" in its name?

08:09.315 --> 08:12.615
I'll understand if you need
some time to think it over.

08:12.648 --> 08:13.550
I'm in!

08:15.148 --> 08:17.748
Good.
We'll send a car.

08:17.780 --> 08:19.949
Don't forget
to wash your hands.

08:28.081 --> 08:30.714
Now when they say
"full scholarship",

08:30.748 --> 08:33.049
does that include
this car service?

08:33.082 --> 08:35.182
Because it seems
pretty fancy.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.914
Mom, it's fine.
It's taken care of.

08:37.948 --> 08:39.881
Remember what we
talked about.

08:39.914 --> 08:41.813
I don't want to get a call
from this new school,

08:41.847 --> 08:44.714
telling us that you've reanimated
all the dissected frogs

08:44.747 --> 08:47.815
or developed some sort of
experimental chicken expanding ray.

08:47.848 --> 08:49.782
Yeah, I'm sorry about that,

08:49.814 --> 08:52.181
but the effect
should be temporary.

08:58.382 --> 09:01.316
Have fun at genius school,
sweetheart.

09:01.349 --> 09:02.915
Tell everyone
you get your smarts

09:02.948 --> 09:04.815
from my side of the family!

09:13.615 --> 09:15.848
Bye, Danny!

09:17.214 --> 09:18.781
<i>Estimated time to London,
England,</i>

09:18.814 --> 09:20.981
<i>is approximately
one hour and three minutes.</i>

09:21.014 --> 09:22.115
What?

09:33.914 --> 09:36.181
Oh!

09:44.248 --> 09:46.815
Mm... hmm? Blergh!

09:46.848 --> 09:48.048
Ugh!

09:48.082 --> 09:50.316
The flying car
is very impressive.

09:50.349 --> 09:52.316
These mints leave
a lot to be desired.

09:55.047 --> 09:57.948
<i>Remain seated with your seatbelt fastened</i>

09:57.981 --> 09:59.916
<i>until the vehicle
has come to a complete stop.</i>

10:19.147 --> 10:22.882
Whoa!

10:28.915 --> 10:29.881
Whoa!

10:40.281 --> 10:43.714
Welcome to Cranston Academy!

10:47.148 --> 10:49.214
Park car 17.

10:49.247 --> 10:50.116
Huh?

10:53.747 --> 10:55.082
Wow.

11:12.781 --> 11:15.215
Wow. It's miserable out!

11:15.248 --> 11:17.882
This is the nicest weather
we've had in months.

11:17.915 --> 11:20.316
Welcome to England.

11:22.047 --> 11:24.681
Cranston is home
to the top students

11:24.715 --> 11:26.882
from all over the world.

11:26.915 --> 11:29.815
You're part
of an elite group, Danny.

11:39.914 --> 11:41.282
Wow!

11:41.315 --> 11:43.316
Look at this place.

11:45.282 --> 11:46.848
Hey!

11:54.315 --> 11:58.316
- Whoa!
- Watch where you're hovering, Mr. Ulanov!

11:58.347 --> 12:00.048
Sorry, Miss Evans!

12:06.247 --> 12:08.881
An atomic
particle reactor?

12:08.914 --> 12:10.181
No way!

12:11.648 --> 12:14.215
- Ow!
- The atomic particle reactor

12:14.248 --> 12:18.715
is off limits.
It was damaged a long time ago.

12:18.748 --> 12:21.582
Miss Evans? Can you please
sign my permission form

12:21.615 --> 12:23.148
to keep
my experiment going?

12:23.182 --> 12:26.715
I think you're making
great progress, Tammy,

12:26.747 --> 12:30.048
even though cloning isn't
officially part of the curriculum.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.582
- Ooh!
- You hear that, Tammy 2?

12:32.614 --> 12:35.049
You're getting a sister!
Awesome!

12:38.248 --> 12:39.848
She loves cloning.

12:39.881 --> 12:43.348
Our 3D bio-printer
has been going non-stop.

12:43.381 --> 12:47.782
Oh, which reminds me,
I need to order more flesh cartridges.

12:47.815 --> 12:49.749
Ew!

12:53.915 --> 12:57.014
Oh, you're going to love your
teacher, Professor Stern.

12:57.047 --> 13:00.082
He's a wonderful educator.

13:00.115 --> 13:02.647
And don't let
his name fool you,

13:02.680 --> 13:04.948
I think you'll find
he's quite fun.

13:04.981 --> 13:06.115
<i>IQ scan correct.</i>

13:08.347 --> 13:09.248
Hm!

13:09.280 --> 13:11.280
Principal Evans.

13:11.314 --> 13:14.215
Professor Stern, class,

13:14.247 --> 13:18.214
I'd like to introduce you
to Danny Dawkins,

13:18.247 --> 13:23.714
the first recipient of the new
Cranston academic scholarship.

13:23.747 --> 13:26.647
Ah, yes, the new
scholarship program.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.781
Pluck a child out
of the academic gutter

13:28.814 --> 13:30.948
and drop him into the best
school on the planet.

13:30.981 --> 13:33.614
Danny, why don't you
tell the class

13:33.648 --> 13:36.215
about your science fair
project? Mm-hmm?

13:36.247 --> 13:38.347
I built a Nano-Bot

13:38.380 --> 13:40.949
to freeze the fleas
off my dog.

13:40.982 --> 13:42.782
But that's just
the beginning,

13:42.814 --> 13:45.847
there is a lot of other
applications for this tech.

13:45.881 --> 13:48.315
Good luck, Danny!

13:48.347 --> 13:50.015
I'll take that.

13:54.981 --> 13:56.215
My Nano-Bot!

13:59.115 --> 14:01.582
Let's get one thing
straight, son.

14:01.615 --> 14:04.082
Cranston Academy
is a school for geniuses.

14:04.115 --> 14:06.015
But I'm a genius too!

14:06.047 --> 14:08.681
Please. Your very presence
in this room

14:08.715 --> 14:11.881
is lowering the average IQ
by at least ten points.

14:11.914 --> 14:13.981
And that includes
the pet hamster.

14:20.948 --> 14:22.615
Miss Evans said
she was really impressed

14:22.648 --> 14:24.882
by my science fair project.

14:24.915 --> 14:26.149
Please!

14:26.182 --> 14:28.182
Cranston students
aren't even allowed

14:28.214 --> 14:30.182
to enter science fairs.

14:30.213 --> 14:33.981
This scholarship is our
principal's short-sighted idea

14:34.014 --> 14:35.681
to bring in
some fresh blood.

14:35.714 --> 14:37.280
But you'll fail
soon enough,

14:37.313 --> 14:42.314
and we'll go back to being the
great school we've always been.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.582
Now take a seat.

14:46.048 --> 14:49.213
- Now, class...
- Don't listen to Stern.

14:49.246 --> 14:51.815
He's just jealous.
My name's Liz.

14:51.847 --> 14:55.280
Nice to meet someone normal.
You are normal, right?

14:55.313 --> 14:57.581
Uh... I read about
your bot design online.

14:57.614 --> 14:59.081
It's brilliant.

14:59.114 --> 15:01.280
Your engineering skills
would really come in handy

15:01.313 --> 15:03.981
on the major class project.
Want to work with me on it?

15:04.015 --> 15:06.949
Thanks for the offer,
but I'm a solo operator.

15:06.981 --> 15:07.914
Scholarship boy!

15:07.948 --> 15:09.848
Stop talking!

15:20.147 --> 15:23.181
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.

15:24.681 --> 15:26.281
Thanks a lot, genius!

15:26.314 --> 15:28.847
That took me
two bloody weeks to build

15:28.881 --> 15:30.981
and it's due in an hour!

16:08.681 --> 16:11.049
You don't happen to have
a radiation suit, do you?

16:11.082 --> 16:13.348
- Uh... no.
- Oh!

16:13.380 --> 16:15.081
That's a shame.

16:24.247 --> 16:25.747
Thanks!

16:53.314 --> 16:54.682
Can I help you?

16:54.714 --> 16:55.948
You're in my room.

16:55.981 --> 16:57.681
Actually,
you're in <i>my</i> room.

16:57.715 --> 16:58.882
Huh?

16:59.881 --> 17:00.981
We're...

17:01.014 --> 17:02.681
Roommates?

17:02.714 --> 17:05.213
Are you kidding me?
No way.

17:05.246 --> 17:08.314
This is so unfair!

17:08.348 --> 17:12.681
You think I want this?
Do I look like I need some unhygienic,

17:12.714 --> 17:15.714
never showers, can't clean up
after himself roommate?

17:15.747 --> 17:18.180
Hey! I shower.

17:18.213 --> 17:19.315
Occasionally!

17:19.347 --> 17:21.280
There has got to be

17:21.314 --> 17:24.982
a rational explanation
behind this.

17:25.015 --> 17:28.347
Yes! Someone's trying
to ruin my life!

17:31.614 --> 17:32.914
We'll just go to Miss Evans

17:32.948 --> 17:34.615
and tell her
you need a new room.

17:34.648 --> 17:37.280
First, you're the one
who needs a new room.

17:37.313 --> 17:40.180
Second, she's not going
to do anything.

17:40.213 --> 17:42.681
I'm the only student
without a roommate.

17:42.715 --> 17:45.281
In that case...

17:45.313 --> 17:46.281
What is that?

17:46.313 --> 17:47.847
A holo-wall.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.214
Just a little something
I invented.

17:50.748 --> 17:52.848
It lets me know
if anyone wanders

17:52.881 --> 17:56.615
onto my side of the room
to steal my ideas.

17:56.647 --> 17:58.748
Ugh! Why would I
want to do that?

17:58.780 --> 18:01.314
I don't know, maybe
because my last lab partner

18:01.347 --> 18:03.814
published a scientific paper
I wrote under his name

18:03.848 --> 18:06.048
and got a R&D job
a Global-Tech.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.213
Ouch.

18:07.247 --> 18:08.949
Yeah. Let's just say,

18:08.980 --> 18:11.648
I don't work
with partners anymore.

18:28.081 --> 18:30.715
Uh... What is that?

18:30.747 --> 18:33.080
You don't know
who Edward Fizzerton is?

18:33.113 --> 18:35.747
I can't believe
they let you go here!

18:35.780 --> 18:38.147
He's only the guy who created
the fusion reactor,

18:38.181 --> 18:40.281
photographed the inside
of a black hole,

18:40.314 --> 18:46.013
and just announced the discovery of
a new particle called the Fizz-Boson!

18:46.047 --> 18:51.782
If you couldn't tell,
he's my personal hero.

18:51.814 --> 18:53.013
He's my dad.

18:53.047 --> 18:56.348
Whoa, wait.
You're Liz Fizzerton?

18:56.381 --> 18:59.014
Wow. It's a lot
to live up to.

18:59.046 --> 19:01.747
I'm not living in his shadow,
if that's what you're thinking.

19:01.781 --> 19:03.147
It's just a coincidence

19:03.181 --> 19:05.081
I'm taking all
the same courses he did.

19:05.114 --> 19:08.180
What's he like? Is he, like,
always doing cool things?

19:08.214 --> 19:10.815
Like, just being cool
or whatever?

19:10.848 --> 19:13.281
No. He's my dad.

19:13.313 --> 19:15.781
By definition,
that means he's uncool.

19:15.815 --> 19:17.614
Are you gonna
tell him about me?

19:17.648 --> 19:20.315
Definitely not.
Good night, Danny.

19:20.348 --> 19:22.748
Well, what do you know?
I'm not quite ready for bed yet,

19:22.781 --> 19:25.815
and the light switch is
on my side of the room, so...

19:25.847 --> 19:28.014
Huh? Huh?

19:28.046 --> 19:29.947
Good night, Danny.

19:41.246 --> 19:42.914
Mm...

19:46.748 --> 19:48.047
Huh?

20:01.748 --> 20:04.881
Uh... Thank you
for fixing it.

20:04.913 --> 20:08.014
I had to do something.
I just couldn't sleep.

20:08.046 --> 20:09.980
Was it nerves?

20:10.013 --> 20:11.747
No, it was snores.

20:11.780 --> 20:14.213
You snore so loud!
It's like a chainsaw.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.180
I'm so sorry
to hear that.

20:17.648 --> 20:18.981
I know! It's like...

20:23.213 --> 20:26.015
I mean, I'm sorry to hear that Liz
is stuck with you as a roommate.

20:27.747 --> 20:29.681
And Liz,
don't be ashamed.

20:29.714 --> 20:32.581
I snore too,
due to my elongated uvula.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.215
I don't snore!

20:36.648 --> 20:37.914
Pop quiz!

20:37.946 --> 20:40.947
You have three minutes
to solve this equation.

20:40.981 --> 20:44.881
I'm sure you all did
the required reading.

21:05.147 --> 21:06.315
That's time.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.881
Oh.

21:08.914 --> 21:10.881
I thought you didn't
do the reading.

21:10.913 --> 21:12.781
How did you come up
with this formula?

21:12.814 --> 21:14.914
I reverse-engineered it.

21:14.947 --> 21:18.615
Hmph. Let's run this through
the computer marking system.

21:21.047 --> 21:24.947
Ninety-nine?
Oh, yes! Yes, yes, yes!

21:24.981 --> 21:28.846
Oh, that's the lowest
mark in the class.

21:28.879 --> 21:32.147
At Cranston, 99% is a fail.

21:32.180 --> 21:34.582
Thanks, Tammy 2.

21:34.614 --> 21:35.980
I'm Tammy 3!

21:36.013 --> 21:38.213
You'll need to do
better than that.

21:38.247 --> 21:42.015
If your major project isn't
spectacular, you're gone.

21:54.746 --> 21:56.614
Working on your major project?

21:56.647 --> 21:59.581
Trying to. I need to come
up with something big.

21:59.615 --> 22:03.582
How about some sort of machine
to recycle all those bad ideas?

22:03.614 --> 22:05.180
Very funny.

22:05.214 --> 22:07.315
Well, I'm going to bed,

22:07.347 --> 22:10.315
so you'll have to close the bad
idea factory until tomorrow.

22:10.347 --> 22:12.980
Ahem.

22:17.181 --> 22:19.214
Ah...

22:39.180 --> 22:41.582
What?

22:41.614 --> 22:43.080
Hmm.

22:56.080 --> 22:56.947
Hmm...

22:57.947 --> 22:58.814
Ha!

23:26.146 --> 23:27.014
Oh!

23:29.180 --> 23:30.614
Shh!

23:34.247 --> 23:36.714
Ah!

23:40.879 --> 23:42.048
Ah!

23:51.746 --> 23:53.180
Oh...

23:59.746 --> 24:02.280
Hmm... New plan.

24:02.313 --> 24:04.180
Fix the atomic
particle reactor,

24:04.213 --> 24:06.280
discover a new particle,
name it after myself,

24:06.314 --> 24:07.880
and prove to everyone
that I'm a genius

24:07.914 --> 24:09.248
and I deserve to be here.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.781
Simple.

24:14.114 --> 24:16.247
Well, Rome
wasn't built in a day.

24:17.613 --> 24:19.080
April 8th.

24:19.113 --> 24:21.880
Inventor's journal.
The atomic particle reactor

24:21.914 --> 24:23.846
is in worse shape
than I thought.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.881
I'm going to need
high voltage batteries,

24:25.913 --> 24:28.247
an insane amount
of copper wire...

24:28.281 --> 24:31.713
and an even more insane
amount of chocolate.

24:39.646 --> 24:40.681
Huh?

25:34.014 --> 25:36.281
Whoa!

25:40.846 --> 25:41.914
Huh?

25:42.980 --> 25:44.081
Hmm...

25:48.047 --> 25:49.347
Oh... oh!

26:04.147 --> 26:06.013
Huh.

26:06.047 --> 26:08.248
So this is where you've been
going every night.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.780
What are you doing here?

26:09.814 --> 26:11.647
Some nights I can't sleep.

26:11.679 --> 26:13.847
Every time I've woken up
in the past two weeks,

26:13.879 --> 26:14.981
you've been gone.

26:15.013 --> 26:16.281
So this time I followed you.

26:16.313 --> 26:18.280
Nice detective work.

26:18.314 --> 26:21.813
You know this atomic particle
reactor is off limits, right?

26:21.846 --> 26:23.680
You're going to be
in so much trouble.

26:23.714 --> 26:25.780
If I don't do
something amazing,

26:25.813 --> 26:27.147
I'm not going to last
at Cranston.

26:27.181 --> 26:29.814
So I'm fixing this thing.

26:29.846 --> 26:32.247
Professor Stern has been trying
to fix this thing for years.

26:32.281 --> 26:36.213
He'll be even more impressed with me!
I built a new IC circuit

26:36.247 --> 26:39.881
and rewired a high powered microwave
generator into the control panel.

26:41.046 --> 26:42.113
Now stand back.

26:42.147 --> 26:44.147
I'm going to fire it up.

26:44.181 --> 26:47.181
Don't fire anything up
until I'm back in the dorm.

26:47.213 --> 26:49.047
Don't be such a baby.

26:49.081 --> 26:51.814
Nobody ever made history
sitting around doing nothing.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.813
Huh?

27:00.281 --> 27:02.981
Well, that was
monumental.

27:03.013 --> 27:05.880
I don't get it.

27:05.913 --> 27:08.780
Your electromagnetic polarity
is reversed, dummy.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.580
Huh?

27:18.247 --> 27:20.548
So far, so good.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.314
That's a bit alarming.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.181
Oh!

27:34.614 --> 27:37.680
Um... Danny?

27:55.213 --> 27:57.180
- What are you doing?
- Checking it out.

27:57.214 --> 27:59.214
Wait.

27:59.246 --> 28:00.680
If you get into trouble
in there,

28:00.714 --> 28:02.213
I can pull you out.

28:02.246 --> 28:04.014
You're such a worrier.

28:11.114 --> 28:12.614
Oh!

28:32.280 --> 28:34.547
Oh! Oh! Oh!

28:41.680 --> 28:43.281
What's going on in there?

28:43.314 --> 28:45.881
It's fine!
Stop pulling the cord!

29:01.947 --> 29:03.847
Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah!

29:07.746 --> 29:09.713
Maybe it's time to go home.

29:13.647 --> 29:15.015
Ah!

29:18.347 --> 29:21.647
Ah! Okay,
it is definitely time to go home!

29:33.813 --> 29:35.148
What happened?

29:35.180 --> 29:37.914
You're supposed
to be tied to this cord!

29:47.280 --> 29:48.747
We've got
to turn it off.

29:48.779 --> 29:50.747
Come on! Come on!

29:50.779 --> 29:52.080
Come on!

29:52.113 --> 29:53.813
Why won't it shut down?

30:03.214 --> 30:05.114
Well, that problem's solved.

30:05.147 --> 30:07.014
Now let's get
that monster.

30:20.380 --> 30:23.313
Uh... Huh?

30:38.913 --> 30:42.346
Yes! Ha, ha, ha!

30:42.379 --> 30:44.347
This is what I needed!

30:45.946 --> 30:48.279
Yes, <i>sí, sí.</i>
Come with me.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.881
<i>Ven</i> aquí.

30:49.913 --> 30:51.581
It doesn't look
dangerous.

30:51.613 --> 30:52.780
Are you serious?

30:52.813 --> 30:54.313
For a monster,
I mean.

30:55.914 --> 30:57.314
Maybe we should try
and talk to it.

30:57.346 --> 31:00.547
Be my guest. I'll be
right behind you.

31:02.679 --> 31:05.013
Very far behind you.

31:05.047 --> 31:07.681
Ooh! So bright!

31:07.713 --> 31:09.680
So beautiful!

31:09.714 --> 31:12.814
It's like you speak
directly to my heart.

31:12.847 --> 31:15.279
- The whisper from an ancient love...
- Ahem.

31:15.313 --> 31:17.681
- ...fills me with passion.
- Uh, hello?

31:17.713 --> 31:19.880
- Like the warm glow from the sun...
- Hello?

31:19.913 --> 31:23.114
...starts a party in my eyes.

31:25.913 --> 31:27.680
Ay, ay, ay!

31:27.713 --> 31:29.880
Sorry, <i>mi amor,</i>
it's not you, it's me.

31:29.913 --> 31:32.147
Ahem. Hello there!

31:35.747 --> 31:39.148
Hello, <i>chiquitita!</i>

31:39.179 --> 31:41.213
Ay, ay, ay!

31:41.245 --> 31:43.280
Please, no!
Don't take me back.

31:43.312 --> 31:45.614
Don't take me back
to the scary place!

31:45.646 --> 31:47.747
We just want
to talk with you.

31:48.746 --> 31:49.647
Who are you?

31:49.679 --> 31:51.746
I am... Liz.

31:51.780 --> 31:54.279
No, I'm Danny.
That's Liz.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.081
Hi.

31:56.114 --> 31:57.781
Who are you?

31:57.814 --> 32:00.580
<i>Daniel, Elizabeth,
mucho gusto.</i>

32:00.614 --> 32:03.781
I guess you can call me Mothman.

32:03.814 --> 32:06.314
I used to be something else
but now I'm a <i>monstruo.</i>

32:06.346 --> 32:08.980
What? Where did you
come from?

32:09.014 --> 32:12.048
- Why are you here?
- What's this glowing slime?

32:12.080 --> 32:13.580
What is a "monstraw"?

32:13.614 --> 32:16.081
Not "monstraw."

32:16.113 --> 32:18.947
<i>Monstruo.</i>
Say it with me.

32:18.981 --> 32:20.314
What kind of alien language
is that?

32:20.347 --> 32:21.747
You serious, Danny?

32:21.780 --> 32:23.846
It's not alien,
it's Spanish.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.081
Wait a minute,
that makes even less sense.

32:26.113 --> 32:27.980
Why does the moth creature
speak Spanish?

32:28.014 --> 32:30.914
I will answer all
your questions, <i>amigos,</i>

32:30.946 --> 32:33.180
but first, I need
something to eat.

32:33.212 --> 32:36.014
What do moths eat?
Oh, I know!

32:36.046 --> 32:37.781
Liz has a bunch
of really tacky sweaters.

32:37.813 --> 32:41.013
My sweaters
are off limits.

32:41.047 --> 32:42.881
Do not eat it them.

32:42.913 --> 32:44.180
Sweaters sound good,

32:44.212 --> 32:47.880
but I'm absolutely
craving for some tacos.

32:47.914 --> 32:50.015
I know just the place.

32:51.747 --> 32:53.814
Oh! I thought I lost you.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.948
You will be
my baby forever.

33:08.079 --> 33:09.713
It looks okay.

33:11.913 --> 33:14.346
Welcome to El Tacos.
May I take your order?

33:14.380 --> 33:17.580
Oh, <i>sí,</i> yes,
good evening.

33:17.614 --> 33:21.781
I would like an order of tacos al
pastor, please, with <i>todo.</i>

33:21.814 --> 33:23.647
Two quesadillas
with cheese,

33:23.680 --> 33:26.213
and one <i>gringa.
Por favor.</i>

33:26.245 --> 33:29.212
We only have
what's on the menu, sir.

33:29.245 --> 33:32.980
Oh, <i>mi Dios,
qué horror.</i>

33:33.014 --> 33:34.981
<i>¿Y eso?</i>

33:35.014 --> 33:36.981
Mexican sushi?

33:37.013 --> 33:38.614
This will make
my ancestors cry,

33:38.646 --> 33:41.881
even those on the moth side
of the family.

33:41.913 --> 33:43.780
We'll just go
take a seat.

33:43.813 --> 33:44.680
Uh...

33:45.746 --> 33:46.947
You call this Mexican?

33:46.981 --> 33:48.314
This is an insult!

33:48.347 --> 33:49.681
Keep your voice down!

33:49.713 --> 33:50.814
If anyone sees you here,

33:50.846 --> 33:52.613
they're going to call
the cops!

33:52.647 --> 33:54.614
Oh, because I'm Mexican?

33:54.647 --> 33:57.814
No, because you're
a four-armed moth creature

33:57.847 --> 33:59.079
from another dimension!

33:59.113 --> 34:01.747
Ah, I see, I see.

34:01.779 --> 34:03.646
Okay, we got you
some food,

34:03.679 --> 34:05.246
now it's time to answer
some questions.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.047
You better start
from the beginning.

34:07.079 --> 34:09.681
Assume we know nothing.
Especially her.

34:09.713 --> 34:11.947
- Huh?
- Uh...

34:11.980 --> 34:14.612
You know, I wasn't
always like this.

34:14.647 --> 34:17.813
I was an engineer
at Cranston Academy.

34:17.847 --> 34:20.213
One night, during
a terrible rainstorm...

34:21.212 --> 34:23.246
<i>...lightning struck.</i>

34:24.914 --> 34:27.681
<i>And I got sucked
into the scary place.</i>

34:29.280 --> 34:31.347
<i>So that happened
when a super high-voltage surge</i>

34:31.380 --> 34:33.112
<i>went through the atomic
particle reactor?</i>

34:33.146 --> 34:36.047
<i>I think the place
you got sucked into is...</i>

34:36.079 --> 34:38.246
- <i>the fourth dimension!</i>
- Huh?

34:38.280 --> 34:40.013
What are you
talking about?

34:40.045 --> 34:41.947
The fourth dimension
is time.

34:41.978 --> 34:43.112
Everybody
knows that.

34:43.145 --> 34:44.813
Yes, everybody
knows that.

34:44.847 --> 34:48.714
Fine. I think the place
that you got suck into is...

34:48.746 --> 34:51.347
the fifth dimension!

34:51.380 --> 34:53.246
Ah!

35:15.747 --> 35:18.646
What...
is this place?

35:26.379 --> 35:29.547
Oh! Oh!

35:39.279 --> 35:41.246
I never thought
I would make it out alive.

35:41.279 --> 35:42.880
And believe it or not,

35:42.914 --> 35:45.847
I was quite handsome
before I was a monster.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.280
<i>But in the fifth dimension</i>

35:50.313 --> 35:52.180
<i>I was attacked by a giant moth.</i>

36:11.913 --> 36:13.747
No!

36:27.913 --> 36:29.714
What is this?

36:29.747 --> 36:31.714
<i>¿Qué pasa? No...</i>

36:31.747 --> 36:33.979
Oh... It hurts.

36:38.245 --> 36:40.046
<i>Ayuda!</i>

36:41.912 --> 36:44.879
Uh... Huh?

36:44.912 --> 36:47.179
Huh? Oh...

36:47.213 --> 36:48.879
Ay, ay, ay.

36:48.912 --> 36:51.580
I spent the last 20 years
searching for that moth.

36:51.613 --> 36:53.180
I wanted my revenge!

36:54.913 --> 36:56.314
You talking to me?

36:56.347 --> 36:59.913
We meet again, my darling,
as I knew we would.

36:59.946 --> 37:04.047
I can still feel your photons
caressing my skin. Come here.

37:07.245 --> 37:09.713
It must be terrible
to have me...

37:09.747 --> 37:12.913
- What is he doing?
- ...and then to lose me like this.

37:12.946 --> 37:17.246
This is the most amazing scientific
discovery in the last hundred years.

37:17.279 --> 37:20.879
I'm definitely getting a
good mark in science class!

37:20.913 --> 37:23.347
We have to share this
with the world!

37:23.380 --> 37:25.247
Easy for you to say, <i>chica.</i>

37:25.280 --> 37:27.880
You don't have moth wings
growing out of your back.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.780
We've all got stuff we wish we
could change about ourselves.

37:30.812 --> 37:32.780
Like Liz
and her snoring.

37:32.812 --> 37:35.580
Danny, I swear I'm going to
strangle you in your sleep.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.213
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

37:40.245 --> 37:42.279
Oh, I'm sorry,
<i>chamacos.</i>

37:42.312 --> 37:46.647
Ever since I became a monster,
I've had horrible headaches.

37:46.679 --> 37:49.880
The only thing that
gives me relief is this.

37:49.913 --> 37:52.113
My dear <i>salsita.</i>

37:52.146 --> 37:54.113
"Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce"?

37:54.146 --> 37:56.046
Ha! My own recipe.

37:56.079 --> 38:00.112
And the one good thing to
come from the fifth dimension.

38:00.145 --> 38:02.212
As I scavenged for food,

38:02.245 --> 38:05.580
I discovered the hottest
peppers I've ever eaten.

38:05.613 --> 38:09.146
They are truly
not of this Earth.

38:09.180 --> 38:11.979
And you made them into hot sauce.

38:13.045 --> 38:14.713
Naturally.
I am Mexican.

38:16.013 --> 38:18.047
- Can I try some?
- Mm.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.980
Be cautious,
my pale friend.

38:20.013 --> 38:23.548
It is hotter than the
fiery depths of hell.

38:24.346 --> 38:26.012
I can handle it.

38:26.045 --> 38:27.347
I love spicy food.

38:27.379 --> 38:29.647
- Hm.
- We'll see.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.113
Mm.

38:39.079 --> 38:42.112
Ahem.
Excuse me for a moment.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.079
Mm-hmm.

38:46.146 --> 38:47.980
Good luck.

38:59.646 --> 39:00.912
Ahem.

39:00.945 --> 39:03.580
So, how was it?

39:03.613 --> 39:05.813
Eh... I've had hotter.

39:25.778 --> 39:29.346
Oh! Oh...

39:29.379 --> 39:32.279
- Hmm...
- Huh?

39:32.312 --> 39:33.879
What are you doing?
We have class.

39:33.912 --> 39:37.146
Who cares about Stern's
stupid class?

39:37.179 --> 39:38.946
We've got to go back
to the portal!

39:38.979 --> 39:42.346
Students at Cranston
don't just skip class.

39:42.380 --> 39:46.247
If you're not there,
they'll send out a search party.

39:46.280 --> 39:49.047
We need to play it cool
and act like nothing's wrong.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.745
We'll go back to the portal
as soon as we can get away.

39:51.778 --> 39:53.979
All right. Fine.

39:54.013 --> 39:55.880
Mothman,
you hang out here.

39:55.913 --> 39:57.581
Make yourself at home.

39:57.613 --> 40:01.113
Oh! Clean sheets!

40:01.146 --> 40:03.679
What's the chance that he's
regularly laundering that underwear

40:03.713 --> 40:05.280
in the fifth dimension?

40:05.312 --> 40:09.879
Actually, Mothman,
do you mind sleeping under the bed?

40:09.912 --> 40:12.113
Keep it low-key
in case somebody comes in.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.146
I'm going to have
to burn those sheets.

40:22.614 --> 40:24.014
- Finally!
- Mm?

40:25.080 --> 40:26.846
Ah! I knew it!

40:26.879 --> 40:28.613
Do not eat my sweater!

40:35.712 --> 40:37.146
Hmm?

40:45.379 --> 40:47.013
Oh...

40:48.746 --> 40:52.912
Your major project makes up
80% of your final grade.

40:52.945 --> 40:54.646
In many cases,

40:54.679 --> 40:58.646
it will be what defines
your time here at Cranston.

40:58.678 --> 41:01.612
Who will be the first
to share their proposal?

41:01.646 --> 41:03.646
Why not Mr. Dawkins,

41:03.679 --> 41:06.913
our "Give a kid a chance"
student?

41:10.312 --> 41:15.779
For my major project,
I'm working with Liz,

41:15.813 --> 41:16.913
and we're going
to demonstrate

41:16.945 --> 41:19.179
proof of a parallel
fifth dimension.

41:19.213 --> 41:22.712
Uh, we're not sure
how it got here.

41:22.745 --> 41:25.912
I think it's kind of like
what happens in a black hole,

41:25.945 --> 41:29.146
where space-time
gets bent on itself,

41:29.179 --> 41:32.346
or maybe like a wormhole
or something...

41:35.813 --> 41:40.347
This is a science class,
not science fiction.

41:40.380 --> 41:43.713
Elizabeth, I would advise
you not to shackle yourself

41:43.746 --> 41:45.912
to someone who's going
to drag you down.

41:45.945 --> 41:48.879
You've got
a lot to live up to.

41:48.913 --> 41:51.213
Now, does anyone have
a real proposal?

41:51.246 --> 41:54.879
I'm working on developing a
wrist-mounted cold fusion machine!

41:54.912 --> 41:57.612
Ooh! <i>Taquitos ricos.</i>

41:57.646 --> 42:00.281
Uh... Psst!

42:01.279 --> 42:02.946
- Liz!
- Ow!

42:04.746 --> 42:05.580
Um...

42:05.613 --> 42:06.980
What are we going to do?

42:07.012 --> 42:08.347
At least he's not
kissing light bulbs.

42:08.379 --> 42:09.745
Danny!

42:09.779 --> 42:11.080
Professor Stern?

42:11.112 --> 42:12.946
I need to use the bathroom.

42:12.979 --> 42:14.212
Stop interrupting!

42:14.246 --> 42:15.746
It's an emergency!

42:15.779 --> 42:17.913
I ate some bad Mexican
last night.

42:17.945 --> 42:19.779
It really didn't
agree with me.

42:19.813 --> 42:22.580
I'll probably be
gone for a while.

42:22.612 --> 42:25.646
Uh, I also have to use
the bathroom...

42:25.678 --> 42:27.079
Bad enchiladas.

42:32.245 --> 42:33.779
What are you doing?

42:33.813 --> 42:35.813
We told you
to stay in the room!

42:35.846 --> 42:39.646
Ha, ha!
Oh, my kids!

42:39.679 --> 42:41.880
I found a taco truck
down the road

42:41.912 --> 42:44.246
that had some real Mexican food.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.946
Ooh!

42:45.979 --> 42:48.779
I was so excited
that I had to come find you!

42:48.813 --> 42:49.779
Okay...

42:51.012 --> 42:53.346
Wow. Mm...

42:53.379 --> 42:55.280
That's really good.

42:55.312 --> 42:58.047
Liz, you gotta try this.

42:58.079 --> 42:59.979
Do you know how much
trouble we'd be in

43:00.012 --> 43:01.812
if someone sees you
walking around out here?

43:01.845 --> 43:03.346
Because I'm Mexican?

43:03.380 --> 43:06.746
No! For the last time,
because you're a four-armed...

43:06.778 --> 43:10.279
Oh, of course.
Because I'm a four-armed monster.

43:10.312 --> 43:13.212
Sometimes I forget,
but then there they are.

43:13.245 --> 43:17.180
Well, Mr. "You-have-to-do-
better-than-this" already hates me,

43:17.212 --> 43:19.147
and now he hates <i>you</i>
for working <i>with</i> me,

43:19.180 --> 43:21.845
so we might as well cut class
and check out the portal.

43:21.878 --> 43:22.812
Uh...

43:26.145 --> 43:29.112
Be a pal and grab the door, would you?

43:29.146 --> 43:31.646
- Ay, ay, ay.
- Oh.

43:31.679 --> 43:33.147
That's not good.

43:33.180 --> 43:34.645
You know
that feeling you have

43:34.678 --> 43:36.979
when things are
about to get really bad?

43:37.013 --> 43:38.846
I never get that feeling.

43:38.879 --> 43:40.612
Now quit being
a negative Nellie.

43:40.645 --> 43:42.012
I'd rather be
a negative Nellie

43:42.046 --> 43:43.879
than a dead Nellie!

43:43.912 --> 43:46.346
Uh, who is this Nellie?

43:49.612 --> 43:51.879
The portal! It's back!

43:51.913 --> 43:53.280
Whatever monster
came out of there

43:53.312 --> 43:55.579
is running wild
on school property.

43:55.612 --> 43:57.113
You always assume
the worst...

43:58.746 --> 43:59.980
In fairness, that student

44:00.012 --> 44:01.779
could be screaming
about anything.

44:01.812 --> 44:03.613
Homework, acne,

44:03.645 --> 44:04.880
final exams...

44:08.080 --> 44:09.780
In this case,
you were right to assume the worst.

44:09.813 --> 44:12.213
New plan: get the monster
back in the portal

44:12.246 --> 44:13.880
and convince that kid
he's crazy.

44:20.113 --> 44:23.213
Oh, man! It totally wiped
itself off on that kid!

44:24.279 --> 44:25.613
Come on.

44:27.913 --> 44:32.712
You didn't see nothin'.

44:32.745 --> 44:34.913
Nothing.

44:38.079 --> 44:40.712
You're <i>loco.</i>

44:40.746 --> 44:42.579
<i>Loco.</i>

44:42.612 --> 44:45.313
<i>Loco,</i> man.

44:57.945 --> 45:00.146
Shh.

45:03.246 --> 45:04.979
No!

45:07.312 --> 45:08.579
What are you doing?

45:08.613 --> 45:10.613
- He's a student!
- A kid?

45:10.645 --> 45:12.346
I thought
he was a monster.

45:12.379 --> 45:15.713
Kids over here
are very ugly!

45:25.746 --> 45:27.047
Did you guys see that?

45:27.079 --> 45:29.679
It looks like it went
right through the wall.

45:30.678 --> 45:31.912
Ladies first.

45:31.945 --> 45:34.946
Why me? You're the one
who opened the portal.

45:34.980 --> 45:38.180
Technically, you fixed the
last piece of the reactor,

45:38.213 --> 45:41.645
which makes you the one
who opened the portal.

45:41.678 --> 45:43.079
Mm-hmm.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.746
So... after you.

45:47.945 --> 45:49.247
You suck.

45:51.612 --> 45:54.879
Uh...

45:54.913 --> 45:58.180
Hello! Gooey
pink monster?

45:58.213 --> 46:00.979
- His name is Manuel.
- That thing has a name?

46:01.012 --> 46:03.645
Well, that is
what I named him.

46:03.679 --> 46:04.680
Huh?

46:07.311 --> 46:08.812
Uh, guys...?

46:11.912 --> 46:15.212
Remember, it's probably more
scared of us than we are of it.

46:18.346 --> 46:21.279
I don't know,
I'm pretty scared right now.

46:23.913 --> 46:25.247
<i>Quieto, Manuel!</i>

46:25.279 --> 46:27.646
Oh!

46:38.713 --> 46:39.880
That sounded expensive!

46:41.179 --> 46:42.345
Ooooh!

46:49.612 --> 46:52.612
This tastes even grosser
than it looks.

47:01.245 --> 47:02.214
Danny! Use this!

47:06.245 --> 47:08.246
Suck on this, Manuel!

47:13.778 --> 47:14.646
Oh.

47:21.913 --> 47:23.579
Explain yourselves.

47:23.612 --> 47:25.980
I fixed the atomic
particle reactor

47:26.012 --> 47:27.713
and messed
with space-time.

47:27.746 --> 47:31.013
I accidentally opened a portal
to another dimension,

47:31.045 --> 47:35.779
and accidentally released a pink
slime monster into our world.

47:35.812 --> 47:38.180
He totally destroyed
our computer lab.

47:38.211 --> 47:39.779
Are you finished?

47:39.812 --> 47:41.579
Yes. No. Uh,

47:41.612 --> 47:44.012
the monster's name
is Manuel. Now I'm finished.

47:44.045 --> 47:46.312
He's lying about the atomic
particle reactor.

47:46.346 --> 47:47.880
I wasn't smart enough
to fix it,

47:47.912 --> 47:50.212
which means
you certainly aren't.

47:50.244 --> 47:52.645
If there's ever been
a better case for expulsion,

47:52.679 --> 47:54.147
I can't remember it.

47:54.180 --> 47:55.880
Uh, wha...?

47:58.345 --> 48:00.579
Something horrible
is going on

48:00.613 --> 48:03.613
and I've got the feeling we're
the only ones who can stop it.

48:09.013 --> 48:10.679
Get in the car.

48:10.712 --> 48:12.112
Go to the atomic
particle reactor

48:12.146 --> 48:13.312
and see for yourself.

48:13.345 --> 48:15.979
There is a portal
to another dimension!

48:16.013 --> 48:18.845
Please, Miss Evans,
you have to believe us.

48:18.878 --> 48:20.979
Life only gives you
so many chances, Danny.

48:21.013 --> 48:23.880
The next time someone
goes out on a limb for you,

48:23.913 --> 48:26.146
try not to throw it
in their face.

48:31.745 --> 48:32.846
Oh!

48:36.080 --> 48:38.146
<i>Warning, warning!</i>

48:42.645 --> 48:44.779
Manuel, you idiot!

48:44.812 --> 48:46.046
You ate the principal!

48:46.079 --> 48:48.046
Miss Evans!

48:55.312 --> 48:58.112
We've got to stop
that thing!

48:58.144 --> 48:59.645
Portal's getting bigger.

48:59.679 --> 49:01.346
It's doubled in size again!

49:01.378 --> 49:04.012
That means bigger monsters
can come out.

49:04.045 --> 49:05.546
How much bigger
can they get?

49:11.645 --> 49:14.046
- I imagined something bigger.
- Awww.

49:18.245 --> 49:21.246
Yes, that's more like it.

49:21.278 --> 49:23.211
Ha!

49:23.244 --> 49:25.046
Javier,
you are bad eel!

49:32.713 --> 49:35.046
I really think you need
meaner sounding names

49:35.079 --> 49:37.812
for these monsters that
are trying to kill us.

49:37.846 --> 49:39.313
What happened to you?

49:39.346 --> 49:41.047
We were trying
to convince the teachers

49:41.079 --> 49:42.846
that the fifth dimension
was real.

49:42.879 --> 49:43.912
You were our proof!

49:43.945 --> 49:45.579
Oh, I'm sorry.

49:45.613 --> 49:47.279
You told me
"hide from humans,"

49:47.312 --> 49:48.980
so I hid from humans.

49:49.012 --> 49:52.079
There's no need to hide anymore.
You'll fit right in.

49:52.112 --> 49:54.178
There are monsters
everywhere.

50:06.378 --> 50:08.145
- Okay...
- Hm?

50:32.746 --> 50:34.713
<i>IQ scan failed...</i>

50:55.779 --> 50:58.011
Huh?

51:21.845 --> 51:24.279
<i>Sorry f...
brr... sorry...</i>

51:36.145 --> 51:38.780
If my calculations
are correct

51:38.812 --> 51:41.245
and that thing keeps
growing at this rate,

51:41.278 --> 51:42.979
the portal will swallow
everything in...

51:43.011 --> 51:45.645
Twenty-four hours?

51:48.311 --> 51:52.178
Take them to the brain.

51:52.211 --> 51:54.312
What are you doing?
Let us go!

51:54.345 --> 51:56.312
- Mothman, stop!
- Mothman!

51:56.346 --> 51:57.979
Come on, Mothman!
What are you doing?

51:58.011 --> 52:00.745
Let go!

52:00.779 --> 52:02.579
Oh! I'm sorry
about that.

52:02.612 --> 52:04.645
Danny, hit him
with the ghost!

52:04.679 --> 52:06.179
Take them to the brain...

52:10.745 --> 52:12.613
Ay!
It's a little bit spicy.

52:12.646 --> 52:14.912
- Stay back!
- Don't come any closer!

52:14.945 --> 52:17.246
- Eh, what's wrong?
- You grabbed us by our heads,

52:17.278 --> 52:19.812
and said "Take them
to the brain!"

52:19.845 --> 52:22.979
- What? No!
- Danny dislocated your finger trying to get free!

52:23.011 --> 52:26.345
I think I would remember
if you dislocated my f...

52:30.745 --> 52:33.078
For the record,
I immediately apologized for that.

52:33.112 --> 52:35.112
Let me see that.

52:35.144 --> 52:37.146
Don't worry,
this will only hurt...

52:37.178 --> 52:38.179
...a lot.

52:41.211 --> 52:45.779
Thank you. <i>Amigos,</i>
I have not been totally honest with you.

52:45.812 --> 52:48.579
My headaches,
they're not normal headaches.

52:48.613 --> 52:52.313
See, inside the headache,
I hear voices that tell me what to do.

52:52.345 --> 52:55.312
The hot sauce is the only
thing that clears my mind.

52:55.345 --> 52:58.979
You didn't think that would've
been useful information to tell us

52:59.012 --> 53:00.713
before you tried
to kill us?

53:00.746 --> 53:02.146
This is why
I'm telling you now.

53:02.179 --> 53:03.912
In case you try
to kill us again.

53:03.945 --> 53:06.046
- Yes
- Very well. Proceed.

53:06.079 --> 53:07.679
I didn't tell you

53:07.712 --> 53:10.078
because it would make you
think I was a monster.

53:10.111 --> 53:12.745
Yeah, you <i>are</i> a monster.

53:12.779 --> 53:15.813
But you're only a monster
if you act like a monster.

53:15.845 --> 53:18.580
Now's your chance to prove
who you really are.

53:18.612 --> 53:22.011
Help us shut down that
portal once and for all.

53:22.045 --> 53:23.712
What did you mean
when you said,

53:23.745 --> 53:26.045
"Take them
to the big bad brain"?

53:26.079 --> 53:27.246
There's a guy in charge?

53:27.279 --> 53:30.245
No, man. I mean
an actual brain.

53:30.278 --> 53:31.579
No way!

53:31.612 --> 53:32.878
The whole thing is powered

53:32.912 --> 53:35.780
by a giant, disembodied,
pulsating brain.

53:35.813 --> 53:37.978
It's pretty <i>asqueroso,</i>
to be honest.

53:38.011 --> 53:41.945
Yeah, but it's our fault.
We have to destroy it.

53:41.978 --> 53:43.111
If we want
to kill this thing,

53:43.145 --> 53:45.179
we're gonna need supplies.

53:46.745 --> 53:49.179
Come on! Come on!

53:49.212 --> 53:51.579
It's ringing!

53:51.612 --> 53:54.078
Hello? Miss Evans?

53:54.112 --> 53:58.146
<i>Mwar. Fick. Toosh.
De. Belan.</i>

53:58.179 --> 53:59.212
Wrong number.

54:00.844 --> 54:02.813
They got Mr. Heath!

54:08.878 --> 54:11.112
Just because the portal
was my experiment

54:11.144 --> 54:13.045
doesn't mean it was
my fault.

54:13.079 --> 54:15.680
Professor Stern, we need your...

54:15.713 --> 54:18.279
Ooh. Darling.

54:18.311 --> 54:20.844
It's okay, Tesla.
We'll go to a new school.

54:20.877 --> 54:22.079
Everything will be okay.

54:37.312 --> 54:39.346
Take anything you might need
in the fifth dimension.

54:39.379 --> 54:40.779
- Flashlights!
- Safety goggles.

54:40.812 --> 54:42.946
- Pillow?
- Magnifying glasses!

54:42.978 --> 54:47.145
Liquid nitrogen!
Flare! Chocolate bars!

54:47.179 --> 54:50.078
- Chocolate bars?
- There's always room for snacks.

54:50.111 --> 54:53.345
I don't want to eat whatever weird
food they have in the fifth dimension.

54:53.378 --> 54:55.579
- Right, Mothman?
- Ooh...

54:55.613 --> 54:57.279
- Mothman!
- Oh, good idea.

54:57.312 --> 55:00.613
The food there is scarier
than the monsters.

55:00.646 --> 55:02.580
Hey! You think we have
time to get churros?

55:02.613 --> 55:04.845
No time for churros.

55:04.878 --> 55:07.313
The tinfoil should stop
those purple tentacles

55:07.346 --> 55:09.211
from making a connection
with your brain.

55:09.244 --> 55:11.211
- You sure about that?
- Of course not!

55:11.244 --> 55:12.345
But it can't hurt.

55:12.379 --> 55:14.745
No bracelet for me.
I'm a monster.

55:16.612 --> 55:19.078
I must warn you
to prepare yourselves

55:19.111 --> 55:21.312
for a horrifying journey.

55:21.346 --> 55:23.979
You will see things
in the fifth dimension

55:24.011 --> 55:29.713
that will make you wish
you were never born.

55:29.745 --> 55:33.211
Mm-mm! Delicious.

55:33.245 --> 55:35.712
Come on.

55:35.744 --> 55:38.579
My love, it's time for me
to work and become a hero,

55:38.612 --> 55:40.279
but we'll have
dinner tomorrow.

55:47.378 --> 55:48.911
What?

55:48.945 --> 55:50.012
Oh!

55:55.279 --> 55:56.746
Oh!

55:59.279 --> 56:01.246
We need to get past
those monsters

56:01.279 --> 56:04.580
and make it to the atomic
particle reactor in one piece.

56:04.613 --> 56:07.844
But there's
too many of them!

56:07.877 --> 56:08.878
Guys...

56:10.745 --> 56:14.313
This school has been
around for over 500 years.

56:14.346 --> 56:17.612
My grandfather studied here,
my father too.

56:17.645 --> 56:20.345
It's our duty to protect it.

56:20.379 --> 56:22.879
If anyone's going to be able
to stop these things,

56:22.911 --> 56:24.878
it's the smartest kids
in the world.

56:24.911 --> 56:26.978
We need your help to blow
some stuff up

56:27.012 --> 56:28.612
and cause a diversion.

56:28.645 --> 56:31.345
- Can you help us?
- Yeah!

56:36.978 --> 56:37.945
Huh?

56:39.212 --> 56:42.078
Whoa!

56:45.612 --> 56:46.778
What's the pH?

56:46.811 --> 56:48.178
It's a 100% acid!

56:48.212 --> 56:49.878
Neutralize it with a base!

56:49.911 --> 56:51.978
Yoo-hoo! Here,
doggie, doggie!

56:52.012 --> 56:54.879
I will distract him!
You guys meet me in the hall!

56:54.911 --> 56:57.078
We need to go to the lab.

56:57.112 --> 56:58.679
Oh!

56:59.678 --> 57:01.613
Ay, Ma-Ma-Ma... Marta.

57:01.645 --> 57:05.979
Lupe!
Nice to see you again!

57:06.011 --> 57:08.911
Uh... Easy, girls! Easy...

57:08.945 --> 57:10.912
Would
you like to dance?

57:23.179 --> 57:25.612
Come on, Marta!

57:25.645 --> 57:28.580
Hyah!

57:28.611 --> 57:31.778
Yes! Yes...

57:31.811 --> 57:33.278
Easy... Oh!

57:38.978 --> 57:40.312
Easy...

57:42.044 --> 57:43.745
Oh... oh!

57:43.777 --> 57:45.744
He won't be able
to last for much longer.

57:48.678 --> 57:50.712
- Where are you going?
- Trust me!

57:50.745 --> 57:52.012
I've done this before!

57:52.045 --> 57:53.878
Oh!

58:01.211 --> 58:02.679
Get ready, you guys!

58:02.711 --> 58:03.844
Lupe!

58:03.877 --> 58:06.345
Run, run!

58:08.845 --> 58:12.079
Lithium hydroxide
coming up!

58:20.912 --> 58:22.912
Stop it! No!

58:22.945 --> 58:26.179
Nice work.

58:29.978 --> 58:31.145
Huh?

59:00.644 --> 59:03.012
My money's
on the hamster.

59:21.745 --> 59:23.245
Don't worry!

59:23.278 --> 59:26.145
He'll return to his normal
size in a few minutes.

59:32.312 --> 59:34.313
We will take care of them.

59:48.745 --> 59:50.146
Come on, Mothman.
Let's go!

59:50.178 --> 59:54.345
I can't...
I can't go back.

59:54.379 --> 59:56.778
Yes, you can.
Come on!

59:56.811 --> 59:58.545
If you had seen
what I have seen...

59:59.844 --> 01:00:02.212
Danny, we've got
to do something quick.

01:00:02.244 --> 01:00:03.978
It's time to moth up.

01:00:04.012 --> 01:00:06.679
We're going in,
and you better be behind us.

01:00:14.312 --> 01:00:16.313
I'm sorry, Danny.

01:00:21.079 --> 01:00:22.578
He left us.

01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:25.046
I know,
but we gotta move.

01:00:30.245 --> 01:00:31.612
Liz!

01:00:43.612 --> 01:00:44.946
Ah...

01:00:51.912 --> 01:00:54.212
Danny...

01:00:57.677 --> 01:00:59.612
Hey! Give me back
my chocolate.

01:01:01.211 --> 01:01:04.945
- Danny...
- Leave my friends alone!

01:01:04.978 --> 01:01:07.245
Mothman!

01:01:07.279 --> 01:01:09.845
You came back!

01:01:09.877 --> 01:01:12.811
- What are you doing here?
- You are my new <i>familia</i>

01:01:12.844 --> 01:01:15.045
and nothing is more
important than family.

01:01:15.079 --> 01:01:16.246
I guess he mothed up.

01:01:16.279 --> 01:01:18.112
You're darn right he did.

01:01:18.145 --> 01:01:20.779
All right, Mothman,
it's a good thing you're here,

01:01:20.812 --> 01:01:23.012
because we have no idea
what we're doing

01:01:23.044 --> 01:01:26.045
- Lead the way.
- Of course, my horse.

01:01:41.711 --> 01:01:43.646
Shh.

01:01:53.244 --> 01:01:55.313
Huh?

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.978
Are you serious?

01:01:58.011 --> 01:01:59.978
Danny!

01:02:00.012 --> 01:02:04.079
Oh?

01:02:19.978 --> 01:02:21.278
Oh...

01:02:25.244 --> 01:02:27.778
Hmm? Huh?

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:31.678
Come on,
we gotta keep moving.

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:39.878
Um... uh, um... <i>Este....</i>

01:02:46.744 --> 01:02:48.113
Uh, guys...

01:02:56.078 --> 01:02:57.311
Danny!

01:02:57.344 --> 01:02:59.878
Wow, they got everyone.

01:03:04.878 --> 01:03:05.812
Miss Evans!

01:03:05.845 --> 01:03:07.712
She's okay!

01:03:07.745 --> 01:03:10.179
That's what I call a generous
assessment of the situation.

01:03:10.212 --> 01:03:12.079
I meant she's not dead.

01:03:12.112 --> 01:03:14.712
I'm just saying you've got
a low bar for "okay."

01:03:14.745 --> 01:03:18.645
The more brains it drains,
the more powerful this place becomes.

01:03:26.744 --> 01:03:28.744
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- It got Tammy!

01:03:28.778 --> 01:03:31.046
And Tammy 2!
And Tammy 3!

01:03:31.079 --> 01:03:33.344
And I can only assume
that's Tammy 4.

01:03:33.378 --> 01:03:36.979
And Tammy 5.
And 6. And 7.

01:03:37.011 --> 01:03:40.745
No! If you unplug her now,
she will never wake up.

01:03:40.777 --> 01:03:42.611
We must stop it
at the source.

01:03:42.645 --> 01:03:44.945
We have to save
everyone before it's too late.

01:03:47.277 --> 01:03:49.344
Stern? <i>Amigo?</i>

01:03:49.377 --> 01:03:50.644
<i>Amigo?</i>

01:03:51.944 --> 01:03:55.711
We used to work together.
He is my <i>cuate.</i>

01:03:56.944 --> 01:03:58.745
Did you bring the salsa?

01:03:58.777 --> 01:04:01.145
Stern!

01:04:01.179 --> 01:04:03.146
We are going to save you!

01:04:06.744 --> 01:04:09.277
No offense,
but your <i>cuate</i> stinks

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:10.845
Shh.

01:04:15.744 --> 01:04:17.078
This way.

01:04:22.777 --> 01:04:26.145
We camp here
for the night.

01:04:26.178 --> 01:04:28.811
Sounds good to me.

01:04:28.845 --> 01:04:30.046
I can't take
another step.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:36.146
Hmm.

01:04:36.179 --> 01:04:38.046
Huh?

01:04:38.079 --> 01:04:39.579
Cover yourself
in the pus.

01:04:39.611 --> 01:04:42.046
- Ew!
- What for?

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:44.844
When the night bugs come,
they will eat the pus,

01:04:44.878 --> 01:04:47.046
and you will still
have skin in the morning.

01:04:47.079 --> 01:04:48.611
I beg your pardon?

01:04:48.644 --> 01:04:51.277
Night bugs.
They feast on flesh.

01:04:51.311 --> 01:04:52.879
How are you
okay with this?

01:04:52.912 --> 01:04:54.012
It's only logical.

01:04:54.045 --> 01:04:55.711
I hate bugs more
than I hate pus.

01:04:55.744 --> 01:04:58.177
You don't want
no <i>cucarachas</i> up there, man.

01:04:58.210 --> 01:05:00.177
No, thanks.
I don't plan on sleeping.

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:16.344
Huh?

01:05:16.377 --> 01:05:18.878
Huh... Huh...

01:05:20.612 --> 01:05:23.712
Ow, ow! Huh... get off!

01:05:23.745 --> 01:05:27.311
Huh.. Huh...

01:05:27.344 --> 01:05:29.079
This place sucks!

01:05:29.111 --> 01:05:32.178
To the brain!

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:33.679
Oh, Liz.

01:05:33.711 --> 01:05:34.978
Liz!

01:05:35.011 --> 01:05:35.912
Hmm?

01:05:40.612 --> 01:05:43.178
Why would you wake me up
when I'm covered in bugs?

01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:45.277
I'm going to be
traumatized for life!

01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:47.744
You'd rather be covered in
bugs, and not know about it?

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:51.110
Absolutely! Would you want
to be awake during surgery?

01:05:51.144 --> 01:05:52.879
- No...
- There you go.

01:05:52.911 --> 01:05:54.145
I didn't wake you up
to argue

01:05:54.178 --> 01:05:56.012
about the merits
of disassociation.

01:05:56.044 --> 01:05:58.277
Listen to Mothman.
He doesn't sound good.

01:05:58.311 --> 01:06:03.712
Oh, Great Brain,
I will do as you command.

01:06:03.745 --> 01:06:04.879
He's just dreaming.

01:06:04.912 --> 01:06:06.745
Take them to the brain.

01:06:06.778 --> 01:06:08.578
Sounds like a nightmare.

01:06:08.611 --> 01:06:11.945
So you may suck the brains
of Liz and Danny.

01:06:11.978 --> 01:06:13.644
That's an oddly specific
nightmare.

01:06:13.677 --> 01:06:15.078
Yeah. Let's wake him up.

01:06:18.744 --> 01:06:22.579
Mwar. Fick. Toosh. De Belan.

01:06:22.612 --> 01:06:23.879
Danny, hit him
with the ghost.

01:06:23.911 --> 01:06:27.578
Oh, no!

01:06:27.612 --> 01:06:29.778
- Mwar. Fick.
- It's empty!

01:06:29.811 --> 01:06:31.110
Toosh. De Belan.

01:06:31.144 --> 01:06:33.345
Run! You have to get
away from me!

01:06:33.378 --> 01:06:35.879
Mothman, no!
We're not going to leave you.

01:06:35.912 --> 01:06:38.811
We're not going anywhere.
We're a team and we're sticking together.

01:06:38.844 --> 01:06:41.277
- Mwar. Fick. Toosh. De. Belan!
- Fight it, Mothman.

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:44.210
You're only a monster if you
let yourself be a monster!

01:06:44.244 --> 01:06:46.979
- I'm not a monster. I'm not a monster.
- That's it!

01:06:47.011 --> 01:06:50.111
- That's it!
- Come on, Mothman, you can do it!

01:06:50.143 --> 01:06:55.811
I'm not a monster!

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.645
Mothman?

01:06:58.677 --> 01:07:02.144
The voices.
They stopped.

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:07.245
- Let him go, you purple piece of...
- Danny, don't!

01:07:07.277 --> 01:07:09.711
You know what happens
if you disconnect him.

01:07:09.744 --> 01:07:11.144
We can't just
leave him here!

01:07:11.177 --> 01:07:13.811
There's only one way
to free him now.

01:07:13.845 --> 01:07:17.679
We've got to go to the brain
and shut it down.

01:07:24.745 --> 01:07:27.812
This whole thing is my fault.
I opened the portal,

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:31.044
I'm the reason there are brain
tendrils attached to half the school...

01:07:31.077 --> 01:07:32.744
And now Mothman's gone.

01:07:32.777 --> 01:07:34.779
Get out of here, Liz,

01:07:34.811 --> 01:07:37.111
before my next stupid idea
gets you killed.

01:07:37.143 --> 01:07:39.779
- But we're a team!
- I caused this problem

01:07:39.812 --> 01:07:41.946
and I'll fix it on my own.

01:07:41.978 --> 01:07:44.711
I don't need something
to happen you too.

01:07:44.745 --> 01:07:47.178
I'm a solo operator
for a reason.

01:07:49.043 --> 01:07:50.844
Stupid fifth dimension.

01:07:50.877 --> 01:07:53.811
Stupid vines.
Stupid tinfoil bracelet.

01:07:57.377 --> 01:07:58.711
Danny!

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:03.611
Let him go!

01:08:13.243 --> 01:08:16.810
- Are you okay?
- Thank you.

01:08:16.845 --> 01:08:18.746
So? Are we a team yet?

01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:21.844
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said that stuff.

01:08:21.877 --> 01:08:23.044
I can't do this without you.

01:08:23.078 --> 01:08:25.045
Good, because I've
been thinking.

01:08:25.078 --> 01:08:27.312
Mothman said the fifth
dimension was a living organism

01:08:27.344 --> 01:08:29.578
and we're looking
for a brain.

01:08:29.611 --> 01:08:32.210
What do these tendrils
look like to you?

01:08:32.243 --> 01:08:34.211
Disgusting,
veiny death hoses?

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.277
Nerves!
Like a nervous system

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:38.877
that runs through
the whole organism.

01:08:38.912 --> 01:08:42.345
The tendrils will lead us
right to it. Like a map!

01:08:42.377 --> 01:08:45.578
A disgusting, veiny,
pulsating purple map.

01:08:45.611 --> 01:08:47.644
Honestly?
I'd prefer a GPS.

01:08:55.645 --> 01:08:58.010
It's some kind
of membrane.

01:08:58.044 --> 01:09:00.912
- <i>♪ Insane in the membrane ♪</i>
- Don't start.

01:09:00.944 --> 01:09:03.345
We must be close.
I bet the membrane is here

01:09:03.377 --> 01:09:05.109
to stop anything
from getting near the brain.

01:09:05.144 --> 01:09:06.812
Stop this!

01:09:06.845 --> 01:09:08.578
You okay?

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:10.612
I think so. Though I admit,

01:09:10.644 --> 01:09:12.877
that plan wasn't
fully thought out.

01:09:17.611 --> 01:09:19.778
Unless you want to do
some major exfoliating,

01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:22.243
you might want
to stand back.

01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:28.077
- Good thinking!
- Hurry!

01:09:36.345 --> 01:09:38.077
This way.

01:09:49.845 --> 01:09:50.712
Whoa!

01:09:51.711 --> 01:09:52.977
These tendrils look

01:09:53.011 --> 01:09:54.645
like they're all
plugged into stuff.

01:09:54.677 --> 01:09:56.210
I don't think they're going
to be a problem.

01:09:56.244 --> 01:09:58.145
Well, that makes it easy.

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.344
It's a brainstorm.

01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:16.011
Really, Danny?
Puns at a time like this?

01:10:16.043 --> 01:10:17.944
Fine! What would you
call it, then?

01:10:17.978 --> 01:10:20.211
A fifth dimension
meteorological anomaly.

01:10:20.244 --> 01:10:22.212
Oh, yeah, because that
really rolls off the tongue.

01:10:23.843 --> 01:10:25.244
Let's do this!

01:10:34.677 --> 01:10:35.711
Huh?

01:10:35.744 --> 01:10:37.843
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:10:37.877 --> 01:10:41.679
Uh, uh...!

01:10:41.711 --> 01:10:44.144
Whoa!

01:11:00.311 --> 01:11:02.345
These are
our friends.

01:11:02.377 --> 01:11:03.811
We can't hurt them.

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:04.877
What are we
going to do?

01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:06.877
We gotta split them up!

01:11:10.078 --> 01:11:12.646
Split them
and tie them! Whoa!

01:11:20.745 --> 01:11:21.945
It's working!

01:11:23.377 --> 01:11:24.977
Yes!

01:11:49.944 --> 01:11:50.811
Come on!

01:11:52.744 --> 01:11:53.778
Look!

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:57.044
Whoa!

01:12:03.712 --> 01:12:07.579
Liz! Help me get the flashlight
and the magnifying glass!

01:12:17.911 --> 01:12:21.111
I couldn't get the magnifying glass.
Watch out!

01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:27.245
Danny!

01:12:27.278 --> 01:12:30.145
I'm okay, but I still need
that magnifying glass.

01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:45.611
Throw it!

01:12:57.078 --> 01:12:58.744
Huh?

01:12:58.777 --> 01:13:00.778
Danny, no!

01:13:05.676 --> 01:13:06.877
Let him go!

01:13:06.911 --> 01:13:09.579
Danny, no! Oh!

01:13:18.744 --> 01:13:20.178
[crackling

01:13:38.278 --> 01:13:40.345
Danny, you're alive!

01:13:40.378 --> 01:13:43.878
Oh!

01:13:43.911 --> 01:13:46.844
I knew it would work.

01:13:46.876 --> 01:13:49.611
Brain freeze!

01:13:49.644 --> 01:13:52.111
- Hmm...
- Oh, come on! That was good!

01:13:52.144 --> 01:13:55.744
What else are you gonna say when you're
literally freezing a giant brain?!

01:13:55.777 --> 01:13:57.643
I'll allow it.

01:14:03.944 --> 01:14:05.211
Stern?

01:14:05.243 --> 01:14:08.677
Stern! My friend!

01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:11.144
Stern, it's me, Juan!

01:14:11.178 --> 01:14:12.678
Oh, my goodness.

01:14:12.711 --> 01:14:14.644
Juan?

01:14:14.677 --> 01:14:18.710
Oh! You haven't
changed a bit, <i>chaparro!</i>

01:14:21.078 --> 01:14:22.778
- Run!
- Oh!

01:14:28.776 --> 01:14:31.177
The portal.
It's closing!

01:14:33.977 --> 01:14:36.611
It's losing power
because the brain is dead!

01:14:36.643 --> 01:14:39.108
It's too far!
We're never going to get out in time!

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:40.777
I-I'm on it!

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.145
Initiate field trip
pick-up sequence!

01:14:43.177 --> 01:14:44.577
Field trip?

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:46.010
Huh?

01:14:57.244 --> 01:14:59.279
Go! Go! Go!

01:15:02.610 --> 01:15:04.112
Huh?

01:15:05.843 --> 01:15:08.344
Mothman! Quick!

01:15:08.377 --> 01:15:10.810
Stop!

01:15:10.843 --> 01:15:13.045
- We've got to get Mothman!
- Don't worry, Danny.

01:15:13.077 --> 01:15:14.944
I got a little thing
I like to call...

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:16.710
disgusting moth wings!

01:15:22.111 --> 01:15:23.811
<i>Adiós, Manuel!</i>

01:15:25.777 --> 01:15:27.611
Let's get out of here!

01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:31.578
Oh...

01:15:33.377 --> 01:15:35.710
Francisca!

01:16:32.177 --> 01:16:33.744
Where's Mothman?

01:16:36.377 --> 01:16:38.810
He didn't make it.

01:16:41.911 --> 01:16:45.711
He gave his life
to save us.

01:16:45.743 --> 01:16:48.044
I ain't giving
my life for no one.

01:16:48.078 --> 01:16:49.011
I want to live!

01:16:49.043 --> 01:16:50.110
Mothman!

01:16:50.144 --> 01:16:52.078
I got four arms.

01:16:52.111 --> 01:16:55.678
Lots of room for hugs!

01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:57.778
- So now what?
- Eat a churro!

01:16:57.810 --> 01:17:01.743
- Okay, but then what?
- Danny serves a lifetime of detentions...

01:17:01.776 --> 01:17:04.945
- - ...but we
probably win the Nobel Prize for Physics.

01:17:04.977 --> 01:17:06.311
- Mm-hmm.
- Sounds good!

01:17:06.344 --> 01:17:08.245
But we start
with a churro, eh?

01:17:13.744 --> 01:17:17.745
Welcome to Cranston's Genius
of the Year Award ceremony.

01:17:20.144 --> 01:17:23.312
And this year's award for
discovering a new dimension

01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:26.277
and saving the whole school
from total annihilation

01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:30.045
goes to Liz Fizzerton
and Danny Dawkins.

01:17:30.077 --> 01:17:33.144
Hi.

01:17:37.143 --> 01:17:39.577
Oh, stop it.

01:17:39.611 --> 01:17:41.611
I always knew
he had it in him.

01:17:44.278 --> 01:17:46.211
Thank you.

01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:50.111
The world tells us that
geniuses are solo operators.

01:17:50.143 --> 01:17:52.577
But I've learnt that genius

01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:56.711
is something created by a group
of great minds working together.

01:17:56.743 --> 01:18:00.078
Hey, <i>amigos!
Gracias!</i> Thank you.

01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:01.877
I'm just so happy.

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:04.711
It's so good to be back
as part of the Cranston team.

01:18:04.743 --> 01:18:08.210
<i>A ver, digan:
Quinta dimensión.</i>

01:18:08.244 --> 01:18:10.678
<i>Quinta dimensión</i>

01:18:10.710 --> 01:18:12.810
<i>Muy bien!</i>

01:18:16.977 --> 01:18:20.210
Oh, man!
T-t-t-that's your...

01:18:20.243 --> 01:18:22.078
Yup, that's
my father.

01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:24.643
He wants you to have
lunch with us later.

01:18:24.677 --> 01:18:25.544
Oooh.

01:18:37.611 --> 01:18:40.644
Wow! All that research
grant money

01:18:40.676 --> 01:18:43.210
was enough to fix
the atomic particle reactor.

01:18:43.244 --> 01:18:47.045
Hey, do you think
there's a sixth dimension?

01:18:47.077 --> 01:18:49.610
There's only
one way to find out.
