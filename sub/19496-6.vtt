01:10.106 --> 01:11.934
Basically,

01:11.959 --> 01:14.574
some people are just better
at things than others.

01:14.599 --> 01:16.926
That's what coding makes you realize.

01:17.402 --> 01:20.129
The number seven is the number seven.

01:20.154 --> 01:21.421
If you call it the number eight,

01:21.446 --> 01:23.280
you don't actually make
it the number eight,

01:23.305 --> 01:25.702
you just embarrass yourself.

01:26.024 --> 01:30.435
Likewise, men are better
at invention than women.

01:30.785 --> 01:32.583
Just a fact.

01:32.608 --> 01:34.823
Now, this makes SJWs upset.

01:34.824 --> 01:36.396
They think there's
something wrong with the fact

01:36.421 --> 01:37.482
and they want to change it.

01:37.507 --> 01:38.560
_

01:38.585 --> 01:39.942
But go to a Google search

01:39.967 --> 01:41.836
and type in "she invents"

01:41.861 --> 01:45.442
and it'll ask, "Did
you mean he invents?"

01:46.184 --> 01:48.294
Or it did until a year ago.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.732
You want to know why
there's an alt-right?

01:51.757 --> 01:53.943
Because Google just
changed its algorithm

01:53.944 --> 01:55.594
so the cucks wouldn't be offended

01:55.619 --> 01:56.734
that men invent...

01:56.759 --> 01:58.969
- and women barely contribute to soci...
- _

02:00.443 --> 02:03.085
That's just one posting
flagged as problematic

02:03.110 --> 02:04.631
by my moderators.

02:04.656 --> 02:06.098
Here are...

02:07.320 --> 02:10.865
4,758 more.

02:10.889 --> 02:13.483
That's why I called you here today.

02:13.793 --> 02:15.547
Oh, and also I wanted to see

02:15.572 --> 02:17.530
what my new Midwest
law firm looked like.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.962
We're glad to have you here, Mr. Gross.

02:19.963 --> 02:21.329
Thanks, Diane.

02:21.354 --> 02:24.017
Not quite as many white faces
as at my other law firms.

02:24.043 --> 02:27.954
Um, I have a little gift for you guys.

02:28.478 --> 02:29.586
Here you go.

02:31.002 --> 02:32.024
VoilÃ .

02:32.049 --> 02:34.055
Uh, pass those around both directions.

02:37.457 --> 02:38.707
He misspelled my name.

02:38.732 --> 02:40.597
He's bringing in 86 million a year.

02:40.622 --> 02:42.246
I'll teach him how to spell your name.

02:42.271 --> 02:44.183
Here is what I need.

02:44.208 --> 02:45.707
A term of service.

02:45.732 --> 02:47.214
I have two sites that have become

02:47.239 --> 02:50.912
like the Wild West of racism and sexism.

02:51.043 --> 02:54.752
My Facebook-like service
Chummy Friends and, uh, Scabbit.

02:54.777 --> 02:56.790
And here's a sample from that.

02:57.313 --> 02:59.719
- "Great, it's..."
- ... Black History Month.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.587
Gives all those porch monkeys an excuse

03:01.612 --> 03:04.003
to be more annoying than usual.

03:04.712 --> 03:07.352
I'm sure you'll be disgusted
by what you find in here,

03:07.377 --> 03:09.024
but it's not just bad,

03:09.049 --> 03:11.141
it's also hurting my business.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.696
It scares off online advertising.

03:12.721 --> 03:14.446
So, you want us to come up with a code

03:14.471 --> 03:15.938
in order to delete certain posts?

03:15.963 --> 03:18.396
Yes, and which users should be banned.

03:18.421 --> 03:19.542
Now, look, Diane,

03:19.543 --> 03:22.668
this is not something I have
to worry about with the ACLU.

03:22.693 --> 03:24.832
I own these services.

03:24.833 --> 03:26.193
I can control them in any way I see fit.

03:26.218 --> 03:28.122
I notice only eyes for Diane.

03:28.123 --> 03:29.693
- Mm-hmm.
- We got to talk to her.

03:29.718 --> 03:32.467
- Make sure he's our client, too.
- Mm.

03:32.492 --> 03:35.121
And now here's the bad news for you.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.938
Disney is threatening to pull

03:37.963 --> 03:40.462
all of its advertising from my sites,

03:40.463 --> 03:43.688
so I need a TOS by 5:00 p.m. today.

03:44.584 --> 03:45.792
Ooh, ooh.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.771
So, I hope no one needs
to use the bathroom.

03:49.538 --> 03:51.207
You know what, one last thing.

03:51.208 --> 03:54.188
I love that this firm
is African-American.

03:54.213 --> 03:56.738
I look at all your faces and...

03:58.437 --> 04:00.076
and I see hope.

04:06.699 --> 04:08.949
So, we should probably
split up into groups.

04:08.974 --> 04:10.652
No, let's divide up the posts.

04:10.677 --> 04:12.371
Agreed. Everybody take a pile.

04:12.396 --> 04:14.938
Uh, let's have racist posts here,

04:14.963 --> 04:17.041
anti-Semitic right here,
and at the end up there

04:17.065 --> 04:20.172
- we'll have threatening posts.
- Uh, we might need another pile.

04:20.173 --> 04:21.457
What?

04:21.963 --> 04:23.735
- "I would love to see you..."
- ... Dead.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.212
Not because you're a feminist,

04:25.213 --> 04:27.448
but because you're an
enormous fucking bitch.

04:27.473 --> 04:30.665
- Misogynistic posts here.
- All righty. Let's get to it.

04:30.690 --> 04:32.042
Oh, good God.

04:32.067 --> 04:33.979
This one is disgusting...

04:34.447 --> 04:36.245
Dad, I've been working
pretty hard lately,

04:36.284 --> 04:38.204
but, um, I'll try.

04:38.229 --> 04:40.049
- I have to go.
- Well, it's just been two weeks.

04:40.074 --> 04:41.792
I don't know how long
I'll be out on bail.

04:41.793 --> 04:43.612
But the problem is, I'm an associate.

04:43.637 --> 04:45.135
I don't control my own fate.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.167
Come by tonight. I'll
make Irish coffees.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.082
Okay. I will.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.582
I really have to go
now. Diane is calling me.

04:53.583 --> 04:55.083
See you tonight.

04:57.112 --> 04:58.861
"... Think we wouldn't chop
you up, too, and do the s..."

04:58.903 --> 05:00.862
Wait, stop. Read the whole thing again.

05:00.887 --> 05:02.190
- Read-read that again.
- Okay.

05:02.215 --> 05:03.628
"You're such a hypocrite."

05:03.653 --> 05:06.337
You chop up baby parts
and drop them in dumpsters.

05:06.362 --> 05:08.282
Why don't you think we
wouldn't chop you up, too,

05:08.307 --> 05:09.659
and do the same?

05:09.684 --> 05:11.003
It's politics.

05:11.028 --> 05:13.268
- It's a political point of view.
- No, it's a threat.

05:13.293 --> 05:14.783
He suggests he'll
chop up the respondent.

05:14.808 --> 05:17.369
No, he's saying why
shouldn't he chop her up?

05:17.394 --> 05:18.768
- He's pointing out the hypocrisy.
- Seriously?

05:18.793 --> 05:20.846
- He clearly means it as intimidating.
- It's the equivalent of me...

05:20.871 --> 05:23.579
taking your political thinking
to its logical conclusion.

05:23.604 --> 05:26.307
If you don't treat an
unborn baby as human,

05:26.332 --> 05:28.510
then why don't we not
treat you as human?

05:28.535 --> 05:29.675
Okay, why don't we vote on this?

05:29.700 --> 05:31.901
Excuse me. You're an
associate. I'm the partner.

05:31.926 --> 05:34.065
- Oh, come on, Julius.
- There's no reason to call rank.

05:34.090 --> 05:35.212
Okay, wait, wait. Let's compromise.

05:35.213 --> 05:36.993
Lucca, start a political pile.

05:37.018 --> 05:38.148
We'll-We'll decide on it later.

05:38.173 --> 05:40.352
Then should we vote on this one?

05:40.377 --> 05:41.971
Is this a threat?

05:42.176 --> 05:44.311
- "Here's a..."
- ... Thought experiment.

05:44.336 --> 05:47.799
If The Purge were real, who
would you set out to rape?

05:48.043 --> 05:50.768
For me, it'd be Zendaya.

05:50.897 --> 05:52.524
Threat. Clearly a threat.

05:52.565 --> 05:55.283
Wait a second. He didn't
actually threaten to rape her.

05:55.308 --> 05:56.768
It seems to me he's
talking about a movie.

05:56.793 --> 05:58.080
Are you seriously defending this?

05:58.105 --> 05:59.549
No, I'm not defending this.

05:59.574 --> 06:03.006
I'm making a legal distinction
between a threat, a real threat,

06:03.031 --> 06:04.987
and a crude, misogynistic comment.

06:05.012 --> 06:08.423
You're saying the person has
to say, "I want to rape you"?

06:08.448 --> 06:11.777
The person has to say,
"I am going to rape you."

06:11.802 --> 06:13.479
Everything else is protected speech.

06:13.504 --> 06:15.533
So, we can't do anything
about it if the person writes,

06:15.558 --> 06:17.764
"I want to" instead of "I'm going to."

06:17.789 --> 06:20.415
Actually, we can do anything we want.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.260
Mr. Gross owns these sites.

06:22.285 --> 06:24.244
He can legally set
whatever terms he wants.

06:24.269 --> 06:26.018
Yes, but the terms have to be fair.

06:26.043 --> 06:28.065
Okay, so, here we go.

06:28.744 --> 06:30.438
-  "I want to..."
- ... Rape you.

06:30.759 --> 06:33.088
I want to come to your house and ra...

06:33.293 --> 06:36.869
If this were another century,
I could fuck you until you bl...

06:36.894 --> 06:40.399
The cucks could never admit
to wanting to rape you.

06:40.424 --> 06:42.588
These posts are all
from the same person.

06:42.613 --> 06:44.119
Directed at the same person?

06:44.144 --> 06:46.276
Yes. Ten posts about rape.

06:46.301 --> 06:47.710
So, shouldn't that person be banned?

06:47.735 --> 06:49.205
It's not just about threats.

06:49.230 --> 06:50.690
It's about continual harassment.

06:50.715 --> 06:53.338
Well, isn't the problem here
that we're thinking of censoring

06:53.363 --> 06:55.872
based on sensitivities and not content?

06:55.873 --> 06:57.401
Does that matter?

06:59.829 --> 07:01.658
I think it does.

07:02.385 --> 07:06.205
And if I'm attacked 50 times a day?

07:08.003 --> 07:09.993
Then I sympathize with you,

07:10.018 --> 07:12.315
but I don't think speech
should be judged by those

07:12.340 --> 07:14.399
who feel the most harmed.

07:20.623 --> 07:23.594
- "I'm hoping they..."
- ... Find your address.

07:23.619 --> 07:25.462
I hope they cut off your nipples

07:25.487 --> 07:28.149
and rape you in a pool of blood.

07:29.204 --> 07:32.477
This is one of 50 posts
sent to my account.

07:33.235 --> 07:36.187
Uh, but that's about your
parents' scandal, right?

07:36.212 --> 07:37.751
My guess is yes,

07:37.954 --> 07:40.457
but sometimes they're so
busy discussing my rape

07:40.482 --> 07:41.767
that they, uh,

07:41.792 --> 07:44.987
they don't have time to
state their reasoning.

07:48.833 --> 07:51.175
I think we should vote on banning users

07:51.200 --> 07:53.270
who continually send harassing posts.

07:53.295 --> 07:54.566
Here's the problem for us.

07:54.591 --> 07:56.575
You know what continual means,
I know what continual means.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.715
How do we define it?

07:57.740 --> 07:58.934
There are people out
there who will quibble.

07:58.959 --> 08:01.371
Yeah, but Mr. Gross wants
us to come up with a code.

08:01.396 --> 08:04.762
That's the bottom line. Otherwise,
we're just filing papers.

08:05.645 --> 08:07.465
Hey. What's up?

08:07.490 --> 08:09.042
... See you today.

08:09.043 --> 08:10.278
What? I can't hear you.

08:10.303 --> 08:12.629
I need to see you today at lunch.

08:12.654 --> 08:14.231
What color panties are you wearing?

08:14.256 --> 08:16.660
I don't know. I'm color blind.

08:16.685 --> 08:18.645
I was in a plea bargaining
session when I realized

08:18.670 --> 08:20.375
I sent someone to jail for 30 years

08:20.400 --> 08:21.599
because I hadn't gotten laid.

08:21.624 --> 08:23.309
You wanted to talk?

08:23.395 --> 08:24.739
Uh, y-yeah,

08:24.764 --> 08:26.590
I'll have to get back to you on that.

08:27.231 --> 08:28.512
Four hours.

08:28.537 --> 08:30.643
Sir, I just don't understand
why we're undercutting

08:30.668 --> 08:33.371
our most important case by
letting the suspect out on bail.

08:33.395 --> 08:35.195
Look at this salad.

08:35.344 --> 08:37.706
Are there any actually good salads?

08:38.886 --> 08:40.332
Chinese chicken salad?

08:40.506 --> 08:42.654
I mean, the cashews
and oranges are good,

08:42.679 --> 08:45.342
but the rest is just salad.

08:45.367 --> 08:47.990
Sir, as important as
this conversation is,

08:48.015 --> 08:50.818
the most hated man in
Illinois is out on bail.

08:50.843 --> 08:53.808
Why are you so concerned
about what Kresteva is doing?

08:53.833 --> 08:56.092
Because I think he's
hurting more important cases.

08:56.117 --> 08:57.912
He's trying to save Illinois money

08:57.913 --> 08:59.818
on these police brutality cases.

08:59.843 --> 09:02.172
So, if he makes
Reddick/Boseman an example,

09:02.197 --> 09:03.787
he scares off 20 other firms.

09:03.812 --> 09:06.728
If he has to let this Henry
Rindell guy out on bail

09:06.753 --> 09:09.131
to make his case, so be it.

09:09.748 --> 09:10.967
Yes, sir.

09:11.772 --> 09:13.295
Wait.

09:14.147 --> 09:15.856
This is what I can do.

09:15.881 --> 09:18.889
You've just been made
oversight head of...

09:19.592 --> 09:22.475
whatever, we'll figure
out the title later.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.334
I want you to supervise
the Reddick/Boseman cases.

09:25.359 --> 09:27.238
- What? Why?
- Because you're obsessed.

09:27.263 --> 09:29.200
I'm harnessing your obsession.

09:29.225 --> 09:31.082
Report back to me on their progress.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.551
Will I have veto power?

09:32.576 --> 09:34.590
No. Oversight power.

09:34.615 --> 09:37.584
- What is that?
- It's like a drone without bombs.

09:37.609 --> 09:40.686
Why is it that whenever
I get a promotion,

09:40.753 --> 09:42.615
I feel like I'm being demoted?

09:42.640 --> 09:43.982
It's a good question.

09:44.397 --> 09:46.850
Tell me when you find out the answer.

09:48.158 --> 09:51.625
Seriously, we can't ban
every use of the N-word.

09:51.650 --> 09:52.916
Yes, you can.

09:52.941 --> 09:54.369
- The only question is how...
- Mm-mm. No, no.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.931
Every rap lyric on the planet

09:55.956 --> 09:57.598
would go out the window, Diane.

09:57.623 --> 09:58.673
What about Huckleberry Finn?

09:58.698 --> 10:00.558
Yes, that would be unfortunate.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.126
All those times Huckleberry
Finn is quoted in tweets.

10:03.151 --> 10:04.392
Here's the problem.

10:04.417 --> 10:05.720
They did a study that showed

10:05.745 --> 10:07.830
that 50% of Twitter's misogyny

10:07.855 --> 10:09.751
was perpetrated by women.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.220
So, if we're banning

10:11.245 --> 10:13.154
misogynistic posts and racist posts...

10:13.179 --> 10:15.376
Uh, wait, I read that
study. It was bogus.

10:15.401 --> 10:17.009
Yeah, I did, too. It's
like they just counted

10:17.034 --> 10:18.815
the words "slut" and
"whore" as misogynistic.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.339
Right, and a lot of the women

10:20.364 --> 10:22.392
used the word "slut"
as in "slut-shaming."

10:22.417 --> 10:24.456
Which supports my contention.

10:24.481 --> 10:25.971
We need to be language neutral.

10:25.996 --> 10:27.720
Yeah, but that's not what you said.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.040
Yeah, I'm going.

10:32.244 --> 10:33.793
Who is that?

10:37.824 --> 10:39.284
I'm bored.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.158
Teach me something.

10:46.974 --> 10:48.223
Come on, seriously.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.463
Teach me how to do your job.

10:49.488 --> 10:51.282
I could be an investigator.

10:53.493 --> 10:56.282
What's that? Why are you
doing that to the photos?

10:56.383 --> 11:00.250
Measuring the distance between
the shell casing and the body.

11:01.873 --> 11:03.883
God, this one's grisly.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.622
Have you ever seen a
dead body in person?

11:07.877 --> 11:09.216
Yes.

11:09.241 --> 11:11.176
- How many?
- Six.

11:11.201 --> 11:12.672
I've seen 12.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.002
Suicide bomb on a bus.

11:15.003 --> 11:17.522
I got to the scene just afterwards.

11:17.881 --> 11:20.139
It's weird how normal it was.

11:20.717 --> 11:22.809
- Can be.
- Except for the kid.

11:22.834 --> 11:25.014
There was a baby in a stroller.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.896
Okay, what do you want to know?

11:31.443 --> 11:33.678
- How do you become an investigator?
- Get a license.

11:33.703 --> 11:35.264
I can't investigate
unless I have a license?

11:35.289 --> 11:37.160
Well, you can, but you'll get caught.

11:37.185 --> 11:39.228
God, that's what's killing
initiative in this country.

11:39.253 --> 11:40.420
Everything needs a license.

11:40.445 --> 11:42.977
Well, you can always assist
a licensed investigator.

11:43.002 --> 11:44.121
Like you?

11:44.146 --> 11:45.889
No, no, that's not what I'm saying.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.443
- But you said it.
- No.

11:47.468 --> 11:49.178
I said, in the abstract...

11:49.203 --> 11:51.662
Um, Maia Rindell, please.

11:51.873 --> 11:53.975
Yeah, she's in there. Hang on.

11:56.261 --> 11:58.545
Are they American citizens?

12:08.504 --> 12:10.904
- What?
- Has your dad called you?

12:11.118 --> 12:12.475
Why?

12:13.576 --> 12:15.327
God, look at you.

12:15.476 --> 12:18.166
- You hate me.
- You're trying to destroy my dad.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.067
- How should I look?
- I'm not destroying Henry.

12:20.092 --> 12:22.252
I'm just trying to keep
him from destroying me.

12:22.490 --> 12:24.154
And you. I'm not the enemy here.

12:24.179 --> 12:25.396
You turned evidence.

12:25.421 --> 12:27.975
Because your dad was doing the same.

12:29.309 --> 12:30.888
Okay, good.

12:30.913 --> 12:33.176
We talked. We understand each other.

12:33.201 --> 12:34.215
- You should go.
- Maia,

12:34.240 --> 12:35.832
your dad is gonna call
you in the next day or two

12:35.833 --> 12:37.623
and ask you to meet him to talk.

12:38.685 --> 12:39.938
Just the two of you.

12:39.963 --> 12:42.832
He'll try to make it sound
casual... drinks or something.

12:42.833 --> 12:45.592
If he does that, say no.

12:46.138 --> 12:48.438
- Why?
- He'll be wearing a wire.

12:49.963 --> 12:51.752
He'll try to get you to
say something incriminating

12:51.753 --> 12:54.332
about me, about this firm.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.184
Maybe even about yourself.

12:58.564 --> 12:59.778
Why do I trust you?

12:59.803 --> 13:01.617
Because I'm your uncle,
and I'm on your side.

13:04.786 --> 13:09.614
My uncle, who is sleeping with my mom.

13:10.739 --> 13:12.278
Is that what Lenore said?

13:12.303 --> 13:14.278
I walked in on you two.

13:15.708 --> 13:18.035
- I've got to get back to work.
- Say no, Maia.

13:18.402 --> 13:20.027
If your dad calls to talk to you,

13:20.052 --> 13:21.621
tell him you can't meet.

13:49.873 --> 13:51.433
Yeah, ready?

13:51.458 --> 13:53.120
Hold on. Whoa, whoa.

13:57.289 --> 13:58.408
Hello?

13:58.433 --> 14:00.667
Dad, uh... I've...

14:00.692 --> 14:02.488
I can't do tonight, sorry.

14:02.513 --> 14:04.284
Oh. Why not?

14:04.417 --> 14:06.728
- Work.
- Well, then, maybe I'll come to you.

14:06.753 --> 14:08.457
No, no.

14:08.613 --> 14:10.292
Not tonight.

14:10.293 --> 14:12.644
Let me see if I can
arrange another night.

14:12.692 --> 14:15.519
Maia, please, we need to talk.

14:17.544 --> 14:18.753
Tell me on the phone.

14:18.778 --> 14:21.062
No, it's better if we do it in person.

14:21.806 --> 14:23.304
Tomorrow night.

14:25.021 --> 14:27.156
Let me see what I can do.

14:28.873 --> 14:30.445
Love you.

14:47.393 --> 14:49.423
You know what the worry is.

14:49.448 --> 14:51.369
Our rules are gonna be
used for political ends.

14:51.394 --> 14:53.395
We have simply been asked to
create a civil atmosphere...

14:53.420 --> 14:55.605
No, we've been asked
to create fair rules

14:55.630 --> 14:56.669
for expelling members.

14:56.694 --> 14:58.455
If all of those members
are conservative...

14:58.480 --> 15:00.603
- They aren't all conservative.
- Yes, they are.

15:00.628 --> 15:02.547
Every example we've used is about

15:02.572 --> 15:04.541
passionate pro-lifers intimidating

15:04.566 --> 15:05.698
poor, helpless little pro-choicers.

15:05.723 --> 15:08.166
That's because the intimidation
is coming from the right.

15:08.191 --> 15:10.042
Well, the censorship
is coming from the left!

15:13.034 --> 15:15.135
_

15:17.934 --> 15:20.002
No, but I have a... could I...

15:20.003 --> 15:22.916
Guys? Guys. Could I
please say something?

15:23.003 --> 15:25.175
Okay, the problem here is

15:25.200 --> 15:27.962
and always will be context, right?

15:27.963 --> 15:30.588
I mean, we can't create
one-size-fits-all rules,

15:30.613 --> 15:33.963
so what we need is an appeal process.

15:34.330 --> 15:35.486
Keep going.

15:35.511 --> 15:38.211
Well, say someone harasses
more than 13 times,

15:38.213 --> 15:39.940
or threatens more than twice.

15:39.965 --> 15:43.048
They are kept from posting
any more until a panel...

15:43.073 --> 15:44.690
reviews their work.

15:44.715 --> 15:46.268
Then the person is given the chance

15:46.293 --> 15:49.260
to defend him or herself.

15:50.299 --> 15:52.057
Can we agree on that?

15:53.537 --> 15:55.126
Julius?

15:55.408 --> 15:56.872
- Yes.
- Good.

15:56.873 --> 16:00.385
So we just kicked our problem
down the road to an appeal process.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.649
Doesn't it feel good?

16:15.182 --> 16:17.348
_

16:20.526 --> 16:22.596
Ho, ho, ho.

16:23.935 --> 16:25.885
This is gonna be fun.

16:33.917 --> 16:37.197
So come on in. Um, have a seat.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.042
Sorry,

16:43.067 --> 16:45.597
they still haven't
delivered my furniture.

16:45.622 --> 16:48.558
Oh, well, that's okay.

16:52.933 --> 16:55.925
Feels like we should have
barbecue and franks here.

16:57.041 --> 16:59.550
My dad called. Um...

16:59.722 --> 17:03.118
he wanted to meet,
alone, without a lawyer.

17:03.143 --> 17:05.877
Okay, well, that's not
necessarily anything.

17:05.902 --> 17:11.058
My uncle Jax, he warned me
that my dad would wear a wire.

17:13.222 --> 17:15.665
Could you, um, reach up there

17:15.690 --> 17:17.862
and hand me that pad there?

17:22.821 --> 17:26.280
Oh, so, this just happened?

17:26.281 --> 17:28.327
Uh, yeah, yeah, today.

17:28.352 --> 17:31.360
My dad, he wanted to meet
tonight, but I said I couldn't.

17:31.385 --> 17:33.531
- Good girl.
- Playing "Goodie"...

17:33.556 --> 17:34.774
... by Good Girl.

17:34.799 --> 17:36.124
No. Stop.

17:36.149 --> 17:38.219
Ada, stop.

17:38.244 --> 17:40.860
Sorry, it's this thing Fantasia got me.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.750
- Ada, stop playing!
- Volume up.

17:46.439 --> 17:48.774
Go ahead, it wears itself out.

17:48.799 --> 17:51.378
- What should I do?
- Well...

17:51.403 --> 17:53.868
I know what I want you to do,

17:53.893 --> 17:56.001
but you may not want to.

17:56.026 --> 17:57.704
What?

17:57.729 --> 17:59.172
Uh, I said I know what I want you to do.

17:59.197 --> 18:00.844
No, no, no, I heard that. Um...

18:00.869 --> 18:02.930
What do you want me to do?

18:02.955 --> 18:05.485
Feed him false information.

18:06.993 --> 18:09.818
Do you know who Travis Leopold is?

18:10.476 --> 18:12.771
- No.
- He's a real estate magnate...

18:12.796 --> 18:15.258
with $8 million in
business at your law firm.

18:15.283 --> 18:18.086
- I never heard of him.
- Because I just made him up.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.728
If your dad asks about your business,

18:21.753 --> 18:23.110
act worried.

18:23.135 --> 18:24.711
He'll ask you why you're worried.

18:24.736 --> 18:27.025
You tell him you can't talk about it.

18:27.050 --> 18:30.390
If he lets it go, he's
not wearing a wire.

18:30.415 --> 18:32.282
But if he pushes you,

18:33.195 --> 18:35.975
tell him Adrian Boseman
backdated earnings

18:36.000 --> 18:38.415
for Mr. Leopold to
help him with his taxes.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.329
And Mr. Leopold gifted your firm

18:41.354 --> 18:45.993
with a bonus of $800,000.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.728
I can't do that.

18:50.729 --> 18:52.438
Yeah, yeah.

18:52.463 --> 18:56.165
That's why I said you
might not want to do it.

18:56.399 --> 18:59.524
I mean, the other option
is don't see your dad.

18:59.725 --> 19:01.665
Okay, um...

19:04.266 --> 19:05.975
Oh. Here we go.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.460
Thank you.

19:09.196 --> 19:12.424
Oh, uh, but if you do do it,

19:12.449 --> 19:14.197
record it.

19:14.625 --> 19:18.624
Just turn on your iPhone and, uh...

19:18.859 --> 19:20.752
hit "record."

19:29.041 --> 19:31.040
Wanna have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

19:31.324 --> 19:32.874
Dinner...

19:33.199 --> 19:35.199
or dinner dinner?

19:35.801 --> 19:37.937
You'll have to explain the difference.

19:38.312 --> 19:40.131
Dinner is fucking.

19:40.156 --> 19:43.257
Dinner dinner is a date, then fucking.

19:43.704 --> 19:47.156
Mm, okay. Dinner dinner.

19:52.156 --> 19:53.646
No.

19:56.189 --> 19:58.521
Hi, I'm Felix Staples.

19:58.813 --> 20:01.232
My heroes are Christopher Hitchens,

20:01.257 --> 20:03.349
Wyndham Lewis, Andrew Brietbart,

20:03.374 --> 20:05.787
Yitzhak Rabin, and Lil' Kim.

20:07.213 --> 20:09.248
Hello, Mr. Staples.

20:09.273 --> 20:10.873
We've been appointed
to hear your appeal.

20:10.898 --> 20:12.404
Great. Mind if I stand?

20:12.429 --> 20:14.623
I... please do.

20:16.346 --> 20:18.712
Who did you vote for
in the last election?

20:18.859 --> 20:20.540
- Excuse me?
- Who did you vote for for president?

20:20.565 --> 20:22.048
- I'm not gonna answer that.
- Why not?

20:22.073 --> 20:23.693
It's irrelevant.

20:25.564 --> 20:28.863
Really? Your politics
are irrelevant to this?

20:29.488 --> 20:34.019
Mr. Boseman, you gave
$8,564 to Hillary Clinton.

20:34.044 --> 20:35.733
Diane Lockhart, you gave...

20:35.758 --> 20:37.483
- Where'd you get that?
- Public records.

20:37.508 --> 20:41.152
$18,860 to Hillary.

20:41.177 --> 20:43.037
Barbara Kolstad,

20:43.062 --> 20:45.770
you gave $23,000 to,

20:45.795 --> 20:48.123
wait, let me check... hmm,
want to get this right.

20:48.148 --> 20:50.507
- Hmm. Hillary.
- What about me?

20:50.983 --> 20:52.054
What about you?

20:52.079 --> 20:54.204
- How much money did I give to Trump?
- I don't know.

20:54.229 --> 20:55.413
I didn't check your contribution

20:55.438 --> 20:56.918
'cause it doesn't fit my narrative.

20:56.943 --> 20:58.562
Ah.

20:58.587 --> 20:59.676
$7,500.

20:59.701 --> 21:01.218
Great. Write your own narrative.

21:01.243 --> 21:03.663
Mine is that I'm a martyr

21:03.688 --> 21:05.601
to your political correctness.

21:05.626 --> 21:07.523
- Maybe not yours.
- I win.

21:08.729 --> 21:11.189
I guessed you would say
"political correctness"

21:11.214 --> 21:14.048
- within the first five minutes.
- Well, that was almost funny.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.744
You know, you're in an
unfortunate position to be funny

21:16.769 --> 21:20.072
because you're all
Tom and Katie Buellers.

21:20.165 --> 21:21.315
Who is Tom Bueller?

21:21.340 --> 21:22.923
They're the parents in Ferris Bueller.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.439
Nobody likes the parents.

21:24.464 --> 21:26.203
Everybody likes me. Right?

21:26.228 --> 21:28.166
The funny guy. The guy who doesn't care.

21:28.191 --> 21:29.478
Good to know, Mr. Staples.

21:29.503 --> 21:31.695
Is that your appeal, that you're funny?

21:31.720 --> 21:34.580
In part, but first I'd like
to know why you banned me.

21:34.605 --> 21:37.374
Well, let's start with
your anti-Semitic posting.

21:37.399 --> 21:39.528
Okay, let's do it.

21:40.298 --> 21:42.079
"When I read your posts..."

21:42.120 --> 21:44.823
... Sometimes I think we
need a surgical holocaust.

21:44.848 --> 21:47.556
Just kill the irritating Jews.

21:51.073 --> 21:53.589
- Yes?
- It's your appeal, not ours.

21:53.614 --> 21:55.440
Well, I'm Jewish, circumcised.

21:55.465 --> 21:57.440
I can show you right now.

21:58.112 --> 22:00.986
Uh, I was arguing with another Jew

22:01.011 --> 22:02.892
who criticized Netanyahu

22:02.917 --> 22:05.495
and wanted to paste happy face stickers

22:05.520 --> 22:07.358
on all the Palestinian faces.

22:07.359 --> 22:08.988
So I said what I knew would hurt him.

22:08.989 --> 22:10.183
Are you arguing that

22:10.208 --> 22:12.418
someone who's Jewish
can't be anti-Semitic?

22:12.443 --> 22:14.964
No. I'm arguing my post was political

22:14.989 --> 22:16.238
and not anti-Semitic.

22:16.263 --> 22:17.667
Right? I-I could've written

22:17.692 --> 22:19.722
"With all due respect,
sir, I disagree with you."

22:19.747 --> 22:21.246
Sure, but that wouldn't have hurt him.

22:21.271 --> 22:23.074
- And I wanted to hurt him.
- Physically?

22:23.099 --> 22:25.362
No, I wanted to make him to cry.

22:25.683 --> 22:28.746
I want to make him cry for
his poor dead ancestors...

22:28.771 --> 22:30.753
slaughtered by anti-Semites.

22:30.778 --> 22:34.040
I understand you want to make
yourself the victim here, Mr. Staples,

22:34.065 --> 22:36.151
but you are a leader of the alt-right.

22:36.176 --> 22:39.011
The alt-right, ma'am,
hates gays, don't they?

22:39.036 --> 22:41.542
- Well, for the most part.
- They hate gay marriage,

22:41.567 --> 22:43.315
they're religious, they're conservative,

22:43.340 --> 22:45.509
and yet, I... do...

22:46.159 --> 22:47.761
Damian?

22:48.054 --> 22:49.909
I didn't want to have to...

22:50.993 --> 22:53.414
Damian is a gay prostitute

22:53.439 --> 22:55.430
whom I paid $50

22:55.455 --> 22:57.179
to blow me right now.

22:57.204 --> 22:59.117
- Okay. All right.
- Too good of a deal to pass up.

22:59.119 --> 23:00.733
- Told you I was Jewish.
- All right, all right.

23:00.758 --> 23:02.619
- You made your point.
- Who's the conservative?

23:02.644 --> 23:04.226
Who's the homophobe, sir?

23:04.251 --> 23:05.658
Not me.

23:05.683 --> 23:09.047
Look, I would... I'd be a heterosexual
in a second, if I could be,

23:09.072 --> 23:10.494
but I'm willing to be fellated

23:10.519 --> 23:11.915
in front of this panel

23:11.940 --> 23:13.650
because I believe in America.

23:13.675 --> 23:14.767
- Damien!
- Okay.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.627
♪ Mine eyes have seen the glory ♪
- All right.

23:17.705 --> 23:20.860
♪ Of the coming of the Lord ♪

23:20.885 --> 23:22.595
♪ He has trampled ev... ♪

23:25.319 --> 23:27.493
God, talk about a piece of work.

23:27.518 --> 23:30.424
He's looking for publicity,
he's trying to provoke us.

23:30.529 --> 23:33.018
So, we don't engage.

23:33.043 --> 23:34.315
We stick to his posts.

23:34.340 --> 23:35.713
See, if we debate politics,

23:35.738 --> 23:37.086
- we lose.
- _

23:37.111 --> 23:38.858
He's trying to make
it about us, you see.

23:46.155 --> 23:47.248
What do you need?

23:47.273 --> 23:49.773
Uh, I know we have another
session tomorrow, but I just...

23:49.798 --> 23:51.998
I want to apologize ahead of time.

23:52.023 --> 23:53.374
For?

23:53.609 --> 23:55.438
People on the interwebs

23:55.439 --> 23:58.304
might have nasty things
to say about you guys,

23:58.329 --> 24:00.399
I just want you to know, I
have nothing to do with it.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.939
Good to know.

24:02.664 --> 24:04.577
You remind me of my mom.

24:05.352 --> 24:07.163
She was a school teacher.

24:07.288 --> 24:09.422
And she taught me...

24:09.447 --> 24:11.311
to love my fellow man,

24:11.336 --> 24:14.773
and if we all just hug our enemies,

24:14.943 --> 24:17.874
peace would last 1,000 years.

24:19.525 --> 24:20.778
So this is rebellion?

24:20.803 --> 24:23.341
No, this is having a laugh.

24:23.540 --> 24:25.749
You don't smile enough, Mrs. Lockhart.

24:25.774 --> 24:27.896
You need to get more joy out of life.

24:28.528 --> 24:30.466
Bye, Mom.

24:38.362 --> 24:39.892
- Marissa?
- Yeah.

24:39.917 --> 24:41.041
Check the Chummy sites

24:41.066 --> 24:43.510
for any new comments
on our firm, or on us.

24:43.535 --> 24:45.424
- Sure. What are we looking for?
- Threats.

24:45.449 --> 24:47.666
- Harassment.
- No problem.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.745
Oh, Diane?

24:51.057 --> 24:52.479
You mean like,

24:52.504 --> 24:53.604
"Is it considered rape..."

24:53.629 --> 24:56.237
... If you rape a female lawyer?

24:57.081 --> 24:58.463
Tell me, Ms. Lockhart,

24:58.488 --> 25:02.276
could you get me off if
I raped a female lawyer?

25:07.614 --> 25:09.231
And here's another.

25:09.731 --> 25:11.452
Ugh, and two more.

25:11.477 --> 25:13.307
Do you want me to forward these to you?

25:15.030 --> 25:17.145
Uh, yes, please.

25:24.091 --> 25:26.817
Yes, I hope you get raped,
but for legal purposes,

25:26.842 --> 25:29.200
I do not intend to rape you myself.

25:58.514 --> 26:00.648
They know to keep it under 13 posts.

26:00.673 --> 26:02.177
- What?
- The alt-righters.

26:02.202 --> 26:04.231
They've been sending us harassing posts.

26:04.256 --> 26:06.723
And each person has only sent 12.

26:07.380 --> 26:09.341
- And how do they know to do that?
- I don't know.

26:09.366 --> 26:11.989
The rules were discussed
in private session.

26:13.727 --> 26:15.200
Did someone leak?

26:16.411 --> 26:18.044
- Jay?
- I'll do what I can,

26:18.069 --> 26:19.489
but these alt-right guys,

26:19.514 --> 26:22.481
my guess is they're not
gonna want to talk to me.

26:39.826 --> 26:41.544
What are you doing?

26:45.602 --> 26:47.101
Mm.

26:47.126 --> 26:49.140
I was surprised to get your text.

26:49.165 --> 26:51.184
- It's been forever.
- Yeah.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.895
Do they have hummus
here, or is it just chips?

26:57.920 --> 26:58.981
What?

26:59.006 --> 27:01.055
Uh, do they have real food
here, or is it just drinks?

27:01.080 --> 27:03.120
I'm on this detox.

27:04.328 --> 27:06.096
I mean, if you eat eight chips,

27:06.121 --> 27:07.818
that's 142 calories.

27:07.819 --> 27:10.265
Uh, I-I don't know.

27:13.504 --> 27:14.889
And everyone goes on about

27:14.914 --> 27:17.041
how healthy guacamole is.

27:17.066 --> 27:18.253
What?

27:19.029 --> 27:20.188
Hey.

27:20.729 --> 27:23.284
- How are you doing?
- Good, how are you?

27:23.309 --> 27:24.335
Good.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.399
Hey, man.

27:25.610 --> 27:27.083
Oh, this is Zack.

27:27.116 --> 27:29.030
- Hey.
- Hey, Zack, nice to meet you. Colin.

27:29.069 --> 27:31.167
Yeah, you too. Good grip. Pfft.

27:31.508 --> 27:32.797
Where do you work out?

27:32.822 --> 27:34.811
Uh... I... nowhere.

27:34.836 --> 27:37.078
I just, uh... it's just
some weights at home.

27:37.103 --> 27:39.569
Oh. If you want to get serious,

27:39.594 --> 27:40.859
here's my card.

27:40.884 --> 27:42.228
- Serious?
- Yeah.

27:42.229 --> 27:43.312
Uh, thanks.

27:43.337 --> 27:44.470
How do you two know each other?

27:44.495 --> 27:46.288
Oh, I'm Lucca's personal trainer.

27:46.313 --> 27:47.652
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

27:47.677 --> 27:50.223
Well, you're doing a great job.

27:50.286 --> 27:52.535
Anyway, I should, uh, I should head out.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.079
Uh, hey, have a good evening.

27:54.104 --> 27:55.422
Yeah, you too.

27:56.412 --> 27:57.711
He's a nice guy.

27:57.736 --> 27:59.207
What's his story?

28:01.863 --> 28:02.893
Huh?

28:02.918 --> 28:05.149
You seem distracted tonight.

28:42.561 --> 28:44.620
Maia! Look who's here.

28:44.645 --> 28:46.552
- Maia, darling.
- Oh.

28:46.577 --> 28:47.703
What's going on?

28:47.728 --> 28:50.076
Oh, your dad was feeling
blue, so last minute,

28:50.101 --> 28:51.770
I threw him a party.

28:51.899 --> 28:53.030
Did Dad call you?

28:53.055 --> 28:54.287
Yeah, yesterday.

28:54.312 --> 28:55.494
Henry, look who's here, Maia.

28:55.519 --> 28:57.598
Oh, my God, I missed you.

28:58.110 --> 28:59.230
Ah, come on in.

28:59.255 --> 29:01.275
I'm helping the caterers make pizzas.

29:02.082 --> 29:03.640
Aw, thank you.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.807
He's been missing you.

29:06.655 --> 29:08.065
Come, come, come.

29:17.819 --> 29:19.960
Look at you two here.

29:19.985 --> 29:22.154
I was just saying how
much I missed us...

29:22.179 --> 29:24.122
- Mm.
- ... being together.

29:24.161 --> 29:26.537
Mm. Yeah.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.136
Bora Bora, we need to go back.

29:31.655 --> 29:33.887
The Pauls are-are
getting ready to leave.

29:33.912 --> 29:36.124
- Oh, I'll get an Uber.
- Yeah.

29:36.149 --> 29:37.673
They're too drunk.

29:41.082 --> 29:42.361
How are you, Maia?

29:42.386 --> 29:43.888
Good.

29:44.451 --> 29:45.740
You seem happy, Dad.

29:45.765 --> 29:46.785
Yeah, yeah,

29:46.810 --> 29:48.399
I guess I am. I mean,
this is the first time

29:48.424 --> 29:50.043
I've felt normal in weeks.

29:50.068 --> 29:51.729
Mm-hmm, yeah.

29:51.754 --> 29:53.241
Oh, me too.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.969
- Feels like when I was eight.
- Mm-hmm.

29:57.130 --> 29:58.920
And work is going well?

30:00.864 --> 30:02.837
It is. Mm.

30:05.869 --> 30:07.914
You seemed a little worried at dinner.

30:07.939 --> 30:09.269
Nothing wrong?

30:11.938 --> 30:13.317
Nothing, no.

30:13.594 --> 30:16.278
I mean, work is... work.

30:16.303 --> 30:17.816
Yeah.

30:17.989 --> 30:20.067
I mean, anything you want to talk about?

30:20.870 --> 30:22.290
No.

30:23.638 --> 30:25.855
I mean, come on, it's your dad.

30:29.951 --> 30:31.722
You can tell me anything.

30:42.233 --> 30:43.630
It's just...

30:44.563 --> 30:47.334
I can never quite tell
where that line is, you know?

30:47.359 --> 30:50.398
Between the legal and the illegal.

30:53.702 --> 30:55.240
What issue?

31:05.753 --> 31:07.382
He asked you about work?

31:07.561 --> 31:10.290
Yeah, but it might've just
been, you know, talking.

31:10.315 --> 31:13.805
Just... I don't know, being a dad. I...

31:14.474 --> 31:15.763
I hate this.

31:15.788 --> 31:17.718
I know. I'm sorry.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.652
Did you tell him about Travis Leopold?

31:21.437 --> 31:22.740
Yeah.

31:26.729 --> 31:27.931
Yeah.

31:27.956 --> 31:29.245
Family's hard.

31:29.270 --> 31:31.359
Yeah, yeah.

31:33.187 --> 31:36.656
Uh, Ada, play something nice.

31:36.681 --> 31:38.233
Playing something nice.

31:38.258 --> 31:42.491
♪ Strumming my pain with his fingers ♪

31:42.548 --> 31:46.674
♪ Singing my life with his words ♪

31:47.189 --> 31:50.438
♪ Killing me softly with his song ♪

31:50.439 --> 31:52.621
♪ Killing me softly... ♪

32:04.319 --> 32:06.231
Hi, do you know where Aaron is?

32:06.256 --> 32:09.136
I'm supposed to get him some
kind of message from Felix.

32:09.569 --> 32:11.327
- Who are you?
- Marissa.

32:11.352 --> 32:13.042
Why, do you know Aaron?

32:13.067 --> 32:14.292
I might. Why?

32:14.317 --> 32:15.606
Look, I don't have a lot of time.

32:15.631 --> 32:17.531
If you see him, tell
him Marissa dropped by,

32:17.556 --> 32:20.425
and I love his "Seven
doesn't equal eight" post.

32:20.561 --> 32:22.332
Uh, s-sorry,

32:22.485 --> 32:24.129
I just get a lot of unwanted attention.

32:24.154 --> 32:25.443
I'm Aaron.

32:25.899 --> 32:27.787
Seriously? Your stuff is so great.

32:27.812 --> 32:30.088
Thanks, it's mostly my late night stuff.

32:32.248 --> 32:33.728
What do you need?

32:33.729 --> 32:35.216
Felix told me to get in touch with you.

32:35.241 --> 32:37.590
He wants to stay off 4chan for a while.

32:37.615 --> 32:39.996
He said we shouldn't exceed,
like, 15 threatening posts.

32:40.021 --> 32:42.390
No, 13, stay below 13.

32:42.415 --> 32:44.584
Someone said it was more.
They know someone in Chumhum.

32:44.609 --> 32:47.425
No, this is from the censorship panel.

32:47.450 --> 32:49.883
Felix has their transcripts.

32:51.352 --> 32:52.695
Good to know.

32:53.152 --> 32:54.556
See you around.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.500
Wait a minute, what?

32:59.525 --> 33:02.185
He has your transcripts
from your deliberations.

33:03.207 --> 33:04.387
How?

33:04.412 --> 33:05.821
We don't know.

33:06.198 --> 33:08.179
Looks like someone leaked.

33:12.698 --> 33:13.990
Who do you think?

33:14.015 --> 33:16.227
- That would surprise me.
- Yeah.

33:16.348 --> 33:19.210
Um, what is your name again?

33:19.235 --> 33:20.368
- Marissa.
- Marissa.

33:20.393 --> 33:23.401
Would you step outside for
a second, Marissa, please?

33:23.426 --> 33:24.658
Thank you.

33:26.135 --> 33:27.655
Jay...

33:29.807 --> 33:32.087
Check out Julius. See if he leaked.

33:35.609 --> 33:36.945
Sure.

33:48.767 --> 33:51.589
What shall we talk about today?

33:52.419 --> 33:54.429
Your posts, sir.

33:54.605 --> 33:56.984
This is all about your posts.

33:57.233 --> 33:58.541
- Diane.
- How fitting.

33:58.566 --> 34:01.525
Uh, Ms. Lockhart and I have
a certain rapport, don't we?

34:02.228 --> 34:04.600
Mr. Staples, please explain your posts

34:04.625 --> 34:07.767
regarding the pro-choice
activist Dahlila Mills.

34:08.313 --> 34:11.918
Dahlila Mills. Dahlila Mills.

34:11.944 --> 34:13.826
Dahlila Mills...

34:13.851 --> 34:16.389
Beautiful name. I... can't place it.

34:16.949 --> 34:20.395
Ah! Yes. My days of rage.

34:20.420 --> 34:22.320
Let's all do our part.
Who wants to contribute

34:22.344 --> 34:25.134
to a fund to take out Dahlila Mills?

34:25.159 --> 34:27.252
Tell me, Mr. Staples,

34:27.277 --> 34:29.866
why is that not an actionable threat?

34:29.891 --> 34:31.148
Because I'm not threatening her.

34:31.172 --> 34:33.563
I don't mean "take her
out" as in "kill her."

34:33.588 --> 34:35.614
My goodness, what kind of monster

34:35.639 --> 34:37.114
do you think I am?

34:37.139 --> 34:39.529
I'm talking about taking
her out of the debate.

34:39.554 --> 34:41.053
And how do you take
someone out of a debate?

34:41.078 --> 34:43.413
I don't know. Shout
her down, embarrass her.

34:43.438 --> 34:44.628
Why do you need funds for that?

34:44.652 --> 34:46.681
Why do you need funds for that dress?

34:46.706 --> 34:49.085
Because I don't want to
end up in that jacket.

34:49.529 --> 34:51.397
Oh! I will see you in court.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.591
Again, why do you need
funds to shut someone down?

34:54.665 --> 34:57.739
I can't think of anything
funny, so I decline to reply.

34:57.764 --> 34:59.039
Well, after you wrote that,

34:59.064 --> 35:01.103
these posts were sent to Ms. Mills.

35:01.632 --> 35:04.132
- "We're coming to get you, be..."
- ... Sure to lock your doors,

35:04.157 --> 35:06.901
'cause the Second Amendment
was made for people like you.

35:06.926 --> 35:10.225
You ever see what a Glock
does to cantaloupe close up?

35:10.899 --> 35:13.073
It's hard to clean up in your shower.

35:13.196 --> 35:15.127
The easiest thing is to just dox you.

35:15.588 --> 35:17.667
- Try using your credit card tomorrow.
- _

35:17.692 --> 35:19.089
See what happens.

35:19.419 --> 35:22.696
Bitch, bitch, bitch,
bitch, double-cunt, bitch...

35:22.743 --> 35:24.110
"... Bitch, bitch."

35:24.529 --> 35:26.347
Wow, they all sound angry.

35:26.372 --> 35:28.911
These are the same
accounts now harassing us,

35:28.936 --> 35:30.466
because you told them to.

35:30.491 --> 35:32.782
You act like I have some
secret control over people.

35:32.807 --> 35:34.579
No, not secret.

35:35.687 --> 35:38.568
Do you have some proof to
back up this contention?

35:38.831 --> 35:40.167
Yes.

35:40.909 --> 35:44.174
An Aaron Fowler claimed
you directly told him

35:44.199 --> 35:48.052
to keep his harassment of
this panel to under 13 posts.

35:50.976 --> 35:52.378
Do you know, the only thing sadder

35:52.403 --> 35:54.451
than Tom and Katie Bueller

35:54.476 --> 35:57.385
is a sputtering Ferris
Bueller caught in a lie.

35:57.609 --> 36:00.595
God, you are exactly like my mom.

36:01.702 --> 36:03.265
- Can I read you a few posts?
- Please.

36:03.290 --> 36:05.581
We want to give you every
opportunity to defend yourself.

36:05.606 --> 36:08.294
This is to me from a
pro-choice activist.

36:08.319 --> 36:09.324
- "Go to..."
- ... Hell.

36:09.387 --> 36:10.737
I hope you choke on the cocks

36:10.762 --> 36:12.520
of the southern rednecks you're blowing.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.794
Now this is clearly a
racist pro-choice activist,

36:15.882 --> 36:18.308
because it's well known the
cocks in question are black.

36:18.333 --> 36:20.753
You can check my dating profile.

36:22.236 --> 36:23.671
There's more.

36:23.709 --> 36:25.549
- "First they'll come..."
- ... For my abortion rights,

36:25.574 --> 36:27.016
then they'll come for your gay marriage,

36:27.041 --> 36:28.386
you self-hating kike.

36:28.411 --> 36:30.540
"Kike." And there are more.

36:30.565 --> 36:34.302
So you can see, I'm wondering
why I'm being targeted

36:34.327 --> 36:36.994
when the pro-choice
side is just as ugly.

36:37.019 --> 36:40.368
If its ugliness matches
yours, it will be addressed.

36:40.393 --> 36:42.345
We're not targeting any one side.

36:42.370 --> 36:44.870
And yet, in your transcripts
from your deliberations...

36:44.895 --> 36:46.364
Wait a second, wait a...

36:46.389 --> 36:48.691
- You have our transcripts?
- I believe I do.

36:48.716 --> 36:50.811
And you know that's
proprietary information?

36:50.836 --> 36:51.995
It doesn't say so.

36:52.020 --> 36:53.613
Chumhum could sue you for that.

36:53.638 --> 36:55.055
No, they could sue the
person who leaked it.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.449
I'm just the citizen-journalist

36:56.474 --> 37:00.247
wanting to communicate it to the world.

37:00.950 --> 37:05.396
Anyway, in this earlier
discussion, Ms. Kolstad,

37:05.421 --> 37:07.630
you shouted down Julius Cain

37:07.655 --> 37:09.657
in language most indecorous.

37:09.682 --> 37:12.642
I believe you used the
word "Uncle Tom" as a verb.

37:17.499 --> 37:18.838
He's a fucking asshole.

37:18.863 --> 37:20.451
And he's trying to make
us look hypocritical.

37:20.476 --> 37:21.805
He's a racist little motherfucker.

37:21.830 --> 37:23.455
So what do we do?

37:24.522 --> 37:26.232
Wait a minute. What is it?

37:29.513 --> 37:31.302
Oh, my God.

37:31.327 --> 37:34.072
When did this law firm become a circus?

37:40.846 --> 37:42.845
Diane. Do you have a second?

37:44.219 --> 37:46.442
If you have something
to say, Mr. Staples,

37:46.467 --> 37:48.871
say it in front of the
whole committee, not just me.

37:48.896 --> 37:49.907
But I don't like them.

37:49.932 --> 37:51.824
- Because you're racist.
- No.

37:52.189 --> 37:54.548
And yes, I don't like blacks as a group.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.544
But that's beside the point.

37:56.569 --> 37:59.647
Have you ever wondered why
Neil Gross chose this firm

37:59.689 --> 38:01.117
to be in charge of his TOS committee?

38:01.142 --> 38:03.259
You obviously want to tell
me something, so tell me.

38:03.284 --> 38:05.492
Putting an all-black law firm

38:05.517 --> 38:07.636
in charge of his censorship committee?

38:07.661 --> 38:09.660
Does that make sense to you?

38:13.460 --> 38:14.919
Good-bye, Mr. Staples.

38:14.944 --> 38:17.027
Good-bye, Diane Lockhart.

38:32.173 --> 38:35.074
I promised to give you a
progress report on your case.

38:35.099 --> 38:36.933
So, hi, here I am.

38:39.545 --> 38:43.917
Anyway, I leaked a fictitious
story to Henry Rindell

38:43.942 --> 38:47.084
about your firm receiving
an $800,000 bribe

38:47.109 --> 38:48.466
from a fictitious client

38:48.491 --> 38:50.245
to backdate his earnings.

38:50.270 --> 38:52.688
Uh, w-what?

38:52.713 --> 38:56.822
Yeah, I know. But we can use
this to embarrass Kresteva.

38:56.847 --> 39:00.941
Ms. Tascioni, I'm sorry to
be prosaic in my thinking,

39:00.966 --> 39:03.675
but this doesn't seem
like a baroque matter.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.167
We didn't do anything wrong.

39:05.192 --> 39:07.681
Why are you misleading the investigator?

39:07.706 --> 39:09.295
Good question. And...

39:09.337 --> 39:12.724
if this investigator were honest,

39:12.749 --> 39:14.137
I would say you were right.

39:14.162 --> 39:17.791
But... and I hate to say
this about any person...

39:17.816 --> 39:20.380
Mike Kresteva tends to lie.

39:20.405 --> 39:22.248
So what do you need from us?

39:22.273 --> 39:25.614
If you hear about this
$800,000 gift from anyone,

39:25.639 --> 39:28.478
that means Henry Rindell
is working against us,

39:28.503 --> 39:30.827
and we might be able to use it.

39:33.822 --> 39:35.234
So what do I do?

39:35.259 --> 39:36.800
Act young and sweet.

39:36.825 --> 39:38.150
Who are we?

39:38.175 --> 39:39.464
Anyone we want.

39:39.489 --> 39:41.530
God, I love this job.

39:43.622 --> 39:45.572
I need glasses. I
want to be a geologist.

39:45.597 --> 39:47.397
No, this isn't a cartoon.

39:47.422 --> 39:50.224
All right? You're a product
analyst. No one asks what that is.

39:50.813 --> 39:52.234
Hi.

39:52.297 --> 39:53.874
- Do you want a setup?
- Sure.

39:53.899 --> 39:56.530
Hi, we're just in the market
for a two bedroom in the Loop,

39:56.555 --> 39:59.535
so we saw this and we skidded
to a stop, didn't we, Jay?

39:59.560 --> 40:01.687
Oh, God, he hates when
I rattle on like that.

40:01.712 --> 40:03.796
But we love each other,
so what can I say?

40:04.006 --> 40:05.586
Young love. It's infectious.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.944
Isn't it? Like the plague.

40:08.455 --> 40:10.969
Well, this is a very
good starter apartment

40:10.994 --> 40:12.219
for young couples.

40:12.244 --> 40:14.474
Especially young professionals.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.384
They're all flocking
back from the suburbs

40:16.409 --> 40:19.074
because they want to be near
the restaurants and the clubs.

40:19.099 --> 40:20.603
Sounds like us, Jay. Dancing.

40:20.628 --> 40:21.938
That's right.

40:21.963 --> 40:24.076
- Do you work in the Loop?
- Yes.

40:24.101 --> 40:26.062
Well, I work as a product analyst,

40:26.087 --> 40:28.186
but I want to be a geologist.

40:28.555 --> 40:30.423
Jay doesn't want me to.

40:30.448 --> 40:32.696
Hey, you look familiar, do I know you?

40:32.721 --> 40:33.868
No, I don't think so.

40:33.893 --> 40:35.682
Yeah. Where have I seen you before?

40:35.746 --> 40:38.504
On that thing that you showed me. Um...

40:38.529 --> 40:41.425
Oh, right. That thing
involving what's his name, um...

40:41.450 --> 40:43.282
- Felix...
- Staples!

40:43.307 --> 40:44.695
- Right.
- All right.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.374
He's my boyfriend.

40:46.399 --> 40:49.386
But our politics are very different.

40:49.926 --> 40:52.092
- Let me show you the kitchen.
- Hey, hey, hey.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.741
That's all right. Our politics
are very different too.

40:54.766 --> 40:56.961
- Wow, so he's the alt-right guy?
- Shh.

40:56.986 --> 40:58.797
I'd rather not share that here.

40:58.822 --> 41:00.345
He's very different in private.

41:00.370 --> 41:01.619
I understand.

41:01.644 --> 41:03.263
But what's he doing now?

41:03.337 --> 41:05.160
I heard he's trying to keep
from being kicked offline.

41:05.185 --> 41:07.256
Yeah, this stupid thing.
They're trying to censor him.

41:07.281 --> 41:08.833
Oh, God, I hate that.

41:08.858 --> 41:10.334
- Is he fighting them anyway?
- Yeah.

41:10.359 --> 41:12.945
Good. Tell me how. I'm curious.

41:18.775 --> 41:20.484
How did you get this I.P. address?

41:20.509 --> 41:22.008
Uh, Staples's boyfriend.

41:22.033 --> 41:24.309
He was bragging about how
Felix had insider information.

41:24.334 --> 41:25.885
And he wanted to sell us a condo.

41:25.910 --> 41:27.569
He showed us the transcripts.

41:27.594 --> 41:30.223
And we got to see the meta-data,
including the I.P. address.

41:30.248 --> 41:31.766
Our I.P. address?

41:31.791 --> 41:34.380
- No.
- Well, whose, then?

41:36.093 --> 41:38.124
Is it Julius's home?

41:38.149 --> 41:40.268
The offices of Chumhum.

41:41.217 --> 41:42.505
Okay.

41:42.992 --> 41:44.472
Okay, let's shut this down.

41:44.497 --> 41:45.746
Why?

41:45.771 --> 41:46.965
Barbara, we have a client

41:46.990 --> 41:49.025
who may not want us
digging into this stuff.

41:49.050 --> 41:51.397
Well, what are you saying,
Chumhum leaked this?

41:51.422 --> 41:52.590
Why?

41:54.171 --> 41:55.751
Because we're being set up.

41:55.776 --> 41:56.979
By whom?

41:57.004 --> 41:59.145
All right. Check and
see if Felix Staples

41:59.170 --> 42:02.135
has any relationship at all
to anybody inside of Chumhum.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.315
It could be anybody.

42:03.340 --> 42:05.523
I'm not liking this. I don't like this.

42:15.060 --> 42:18.549
Slavery ended 153 years ago.

42:18.574 --> 42:21.845
It's time for the fucking
Neil Grosses to get over it.

42:24.752 --> 42:27.214
America is being turned
into a welfare state

42:27.239 --> 42:29.849
by all these stupid Neil Grosses.

42:30.223 --> 42:32.697
#DumbNeilGross.

42:45.962 --> 42:48.211
Love seeing all the
Neil Grosses in Ferguson,

42:48.236 --> 42:50.868
breaking windows to steal Nikes.

42:56.724 --> 42:58.068
Any relationship at all, to anybody...

42:58.093 --> 43:00.078
Can I talk to you for a second?

43:02.461 --> 43:04.254
One of the alt-right
boys really likes me,

43:04.279 --> 43:05.593
he thinks I'm one of them.

43:05.618 --> 43:06.811
- How do you even know...
- It's nothing.

43:06.836 --> 43:09.125
They're easily confused when
women offer them attention.

43:09.150 --> 43:10.596
Anyway, he sent me a link.

43:10.621 --> 43:13.750
They're working to get
around your racist N-word ban.

43:14.091 --> 43:15.149
How?

43:15.174 --> 43:18.345
Whenever they mean N-word
they instead type Neil Gross.

43:18.915 --> 43:21.676
Yeah. I can print up the
posts, but there are a lot.

43:21.701 --> 43:24.740
All racist jokes with Neil
Gross as the punchline.

43:26.051 --> 43:28.729
That's not gonna go over well.

43:32.747 --> 43:35.895
I hate games, so knock it the fuck off.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.879
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

43:37.904 --> 43:39.787
That guy you saw me with last night...

43:39.812 --> 43:41.485
- Oh, Magic Mike?
- Yes.

43:41.510 --> 43:43.009
You know I fucked him.

43:43.161 --> 43:45.320
I figured as much.

43:45.612 --> 43:47.195
But you don't care.

43:47.220 --> 43:49.292
Well, uh, you made it pretty clear

43:49.317 --> 43:52.195
that our relationship was,

43:52.220 --> 43:55.199
- well, not really a relationship.
- It's not.

43:56.149 --> 43:57.230
Okay.

43:57.255 --> 44:00.171
Let me take a shot at what I
think is happening right now.

44:00.196 --> 44:02.472
You're worried that
we're getting too serious,

44:02.497 --> 44:03.999
so you turn down a date with me,

44:04.024 --> 44:05.498
and then you invite your boy toy

44:05.523 --> 44:07.347
to a place where I might see him,

44:07.372 --> 44:09.734
thus ending our "relationship."

44:09.759 --> 44:11.023
Am I right?

44:11.610 --> 44:14.169
Problem is, now you're
here, arguing with me,

44:14.194 --> 44:17.756
which kind of proves
your plan didn't work out,

44:17.781 --> 44:20.030
and our relationship isn't over.

44:20.226 --> 44:21.684
How'd I do?

44:23.864 --> 44:25.144
Let's go.

44:28.617 --> 44:30.130
Where?

44:30.155 --> 44:31.643
You decide.

45:52.870 --> 45:54.507
What is this?

45:54.778 --> 45:56.362
My place.

45:59.228 --> 46:01.218
So, you're rich?

46:02.609 --> 46:05.403
I guess so. Does that bother you?

46:06.318 --> 46:07.839
I don't know.

46:08.421 --> 46:13.130
Can we... decide whether
it bothers you later?

46:40.771 --> 46:42.127
You bastards.

46:42.152 --> 46:43.278
Whoa, whoa.

46:43.303 --> 46:44.826
You thought I leaked?

46:47.386 --> 46:48.725
You searched my office.

46:48.750 --> 46:50.806
No, we didn't know
whether you leaked or...

46:50.831 --> 46:53.100
This is about Trump.
This is about politics.

46:53.125 --> 46:56.324
Julius, this is about maintaining
the integrity of this firm.

46:56.349 --> 46:59.388
No. I was loyal to you.

46:59.834 --> 47:01.282
I was the most loyal employee you had.

47:01.307 --> 47:02.896
We had to know who was leaking.

47:02.921 --> 47:05.010
And did you investigate Diane?

47:06.282 --> 47:07.624
Or Lucca?

47:08.425 --> 47:10.280
Or anybody else?

47:13.974 --> 47:16.697
You just lost your most loyal employee.

47:35.272 --> 47:38.493
Hi, this is Julius Cain.

47:39.158 --> 47:40.957
You were right.

47:42.326 --> 47:44.253
I think we should talk.

47:52.136 --> 47:53.723
They're using my name?

47:53.748 --> 47:54.895
Yes.

47:55.026 --> 47:57.288
I-I don't understand. How?

47:58.108 --> 48:00.087
As a replacement for the N-word.

48:05.128 --> 48:06.311
What, seriously?

48:06.336 --> 48:07.375
- Yes.
- Why?

48:07.400 --> 48:10.514
- They know you can't censor it.
- Oh, my God.

48:11.648 --> 48:13.570
They're like savages.

48:16.183 --> 48:17.399
So, what do we do?

48:17.424 --> 48:19.330
I'm not sure there's
anything you can do.

48:19.355 --> 48:21.354
They're like kids wanting
to upset Mommy and Daddy.

48:21.379 --> 48:22.980
Well, here's the problem, Diane.

48:23.005 --> 48:24.237
I am upset.

48:24.699 --> 48:25.828
I know.

48:25.853 --> 48:28.037
You know, they're reacting
to that damn committee.

48:28.062 --> 48:30.466
Yeah. They're working around
the new rules we implemented.

48:30.491 --> 48:32.668
This whole mess with
Staples needs to end.

48:32.693 --> 48:33.861
He's got too many followers,

48:33.886 --> 48:36.020
and they're threatening
to leave my services,

48:36.045 --> 48:37.419
so make it end.

48:45.462 --> 48:47.078
We've reconsidered.

48:47.103 --> 48:48.122
"Reconsidered"?

48:48.147 --> 48:51.420
We're prepared to overturn
the ban and reinstate you.

48:51.615 --> 48:52.902
What?

48:54.561 --> 48:57.167
No, things were just
getting interesting.

48:57.764 --> 48:59.806
- We're done.
- I'm not...

48:59.831 --> 49:02.100
- Thank you.
- No, we're not done. Diane.

49:02.101 --> 49:04.617
Diane, I've got a number of po...

49:05.221 --> 49:06.514
I've...

49:07.293 --> 49:08.801
Diane!

49:10.001 --> 49:11.858
This is totally fucked!

49:11.883 --> 49:14.742
I am here defending myself
and what? You all slink off?

49:14.767 --> 49:18.016
Mr. Staples. It's over. We're done.

49:18.041 --> 49:20.764
We took the oxygen
from your room. Go home.

49:20.789 --> 49:22.405
I want you to read
this new attack on me.

49:22.430 --> 49:25.403
"Die, you cocksucker.
Free speech is outmoded.

49:25.428 --> 49:28.034
"It's a law written by slave owners."

49:28.059 --> 49:29.597
What do you want, Mr. Staples?

49:29.622 --> 49:31.233
You've been reinstated.

49:31.258 --> 49:33.652
I don't accept your reinstatement.

49:36.746 --> 49:38.646
You're a clown.

49:39.548 --> 49:41.728
What's worse is you're a smart clown

49:41.753 --> 49:44.413
who occasionally has a point,

49:44.438 --> 49:47.900
a point you destroy by mixing
it up with racism and misogyny

49:47.925 --> 49:50.255
you probably don't even believe.

49:51.428 --> 49:54.438
When you were little, someone
rejected you or made fun of you,

49:54.463 --> 49:56.941
and now you get to be one of the
mean guys, making fun of others.

49:56.966 --> 49:59.519
And you get to be the
principal? Outraged?

49:59.544 --> 50:01.288
No, I just have better things to do.

50:01.313 --> 50:02.708
Oh, really?

50:03.048 --> 50:05.308
You think this is some grand rebellion

50:05.333 --> 50:09.143
against progressives and social
justice warriors, it's not.

50:09.413 --> 50:12.034
You're just some kid in
the corner pissing yourself,

50:12.059 --> 50:13.738
so have at it.

50:17.174 --> 50:19.418
You've lost, Diane.

50:21.016 --> 50:22.799
And you're upset,

50:23.509 --> 50:25.938
'cause I'm the
embodiment of free speech.

50:26.993 --> 50:30.272
No, but you are what
we have to tolerate,

50:30.298 --> 50:32.174
so thank you.

50:32.461 --> 50:33.751
Now go.

50:38.342 --> 50:39.701
Go.

50:50.428 --> 50:53.127
So, there were no real expulsions?

50:53.128 --> 50:56.710
One, but it was reversed on appeal.

50:56.735 --> 50:58.627
- That was Staples?
- Mm-hmm.

50:58.628 --> 51:01.259
And, uh, the leak of your deliberations?

51:01.284 --> 51:02.772
That was from you.

51:06.315 --> 51:10.967
You're saying we leaked
your deliberations?

51:11.202 --> 51:12.594
Yes.

51:14.334 --> 51:16.486
- Why?
- We were a trial balloon.

51:16.511 --> 51:18.155
You wanted to censor your sites,

51:18.180 --> 51:21.948
but if we failed, you could
point to us as the problem:

51:21.973 --> 51:23.859
a liberal African-American firm.

51:23.884 --> 51:25.736
- Really?
- That's why we're here, sir,

51:25.761 --> 51:27.573
to make you look good.

51:31.668 --> 51:35.048
Okay, good. Thanks.

51:37.100 --> 51:38.619
Um,

51:39.129 --> 51:42.040
I, uh, I have a few issues overseas.

51:42.065 --> 51:45.048
Do you have a minute, Adrian, Barbara?

51:48.576 --> 51:50.173
- We do.
- Good.

51:56.506 --> 51:58.793
Do you need anything from me?

51:58.917 --> 52:01.236
No, I think we're good.

52:01.261 --> 52:02.771
Thanks.

52:19.494 --> 52:21.983
- What are you doing...
- I need a second.

52:28.090 --> 52:29.443
What?

52:29.468 --> 52:31.701
You're not up for partner
anytime soon, are you?

52:31.726 --> 52:34.553
No, not that I know of.

52:35.159 --> 52:37.539
You should, uh...

52:37.965 --> 52:40.842
stay clear of your firm's finances.

52:42.311 --> 52:43.561
Why?

52:47.676 --> 52:51.903
Reddick/Boseman took an
$800,000 bribe from a client.

52:51.928 --> 52:53.960
It might be in trouble.

52:55.515 --> 52:58.100
I don't want you to get in trouble.

52:59.358 --> 53:02.433
The client's name is Travis Leopold.

53:10.532 --> 53:11.744
Okay.

53:13.599 --> 53:14.868
Thanks.
