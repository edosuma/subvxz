- Previously on <i>the affair...</i>

00:09.610 --> 00:12.478
- Mr. Solloway,
thanks for coming in.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.346
- Well,
like I had much of a choice.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.647
- Where's martin?

00:15.649 --> 00:18.283
- I hate grandpa.
- I know. So do I.

00:18.285 --> 00:21.387
At least you stand to inherit
some of his money when he dies.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.654
- So I read your book.

00:22.656 --> 00:25.224
Everyone has one book in them.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.092
Almost nobody has two.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.261
- Why're you laughing?
- It's--

00:29.263 --> 00:31.497
- What? Why you laughing?
- Your face is a little funny.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.432
That's all.
[giggles]

00:33.434 --> 00:35.100
- Welcome to the end
of the world.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.369
- Do you remember the first time
you saw her?

00:37.371 --> 00:39.104
- Like it was yesterday.

00:39.106 --> 00:41.373
- Ms. Lockhart, do you remember
seeing him for the first time?

00:41.375 --> 00:44.076
- Turn her over.
- Hit her hard!

00:44.078 --> 00:45.577
- I remember he
was holding his daughter.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.112
[overlapping shouting]

00:47.114 --> 00:49.782
- You saved her life.
I'm noah, by the way.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.117
- Why don't you tell me
how it began?

00:52.119 --> 00:55.087
- How many times do you think
we've had sex?

00:55.089 --> 00:56.488
10,000?

00:56.490 --> 00:57.790
- Yeah, maybe.

00:57.792 --> 01:01.326
Let's try to have
a good day today.

01:01.328 --> 01:04.663
I wake up every morning
with his face in my mind too.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.566
- It just hurts.
Make it stop.

01:08.701 --> 01:11.270
- Alison?
- You found me!

01:11.272 --> 01:13.405
- I found you.
- Oh, hi.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.207
- You live around here?

01:15.209 --> 01:17.209
- Walk me home then?

01:17.211 --> 01:19.144
I think you want to see this.

01:19.146 --> 01:23.715
- I got to go.
- Thanks for the walk.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.784
Oh, no.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.553
So go.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.489
- Leave me alone!
- Stop it!

01:34.494 --> 01:36.428
- How much longer
is this gonna take?

01:36.430 --> 01:38.597
- I just have
a few more questions.

married when I first met her.

03:06.654 --> 03:10.622
I mean, how would I have known?
She never mentioned it.

03:10.624 --> 03:14.927
She seemed like
the loneliest girl in the world.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.873
I just thought she was bad news.

03:32.445 --> 03:37.950
So, after that first night I
went out of my way to avoid her.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.562
I had my second book on my mind.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.932
I was under a lot of pressure
to get it done, make it good.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.342

04:07.880 --> 04:10.349
- I just picked up a copy
of that book.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.551
I'm looking forward
to reading it.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.587
- Oh, good for you, man.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.423
I hope you enjoy it.

04:18.425 --> 04:22.728
Anyway, the point is I wasn't
thinking about her at all.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.286

[door opens]

05:07.641 --> 05:08.640
- Hi.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.975
- Hi.

05:11.911 --> 05:14.413
- Want some company?

05:14.415 --> 05:16.581
- Uh...

05:16.583 --> 05:18.784
Not really.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.653
- Gee, thanks.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.990
- I'm taking some me time.

05:24.992 --> 05:29.561
- You know, you're not as much
fun as you used to be.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.931
- I was never fun.
I think you've become more fun.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.966
I think that's the problem.

05:37.537 --> 05:42.107
- I'm gonna go find a pool boy
that lets me shower with him.

05:42.109 --> 05:46.812
- Can we have breakfast
together before you do?

05:55.121 --> 05:58.857
- Ready?
Whoops, that's a big one.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.394
[sizzling sound]

06:04.732 --> 06:06.798
Advil, right?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.468

were there last summer.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.836
- They were.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.372
Mother had an efficiency
expert re-do the kitchen.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.973

I got years
of my life back.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.677

- Miranda,

06:18.679 --> 06:21.113
Make sure the caterers know
we increased the guest count

06:21.115 --> 06:23.048
To 200 people.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.550
- Good morning, mr. Solloway.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.119
- Hello, ruby.
- Checkmate!

06:27.121 --> 06:29.721
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.791
- Trevor, it's highly unlikely
you're gonna win this game.

06:32.793 --> 06:33.959
I'm older and I'm smarter--

06:33.961 --> 06:35.594
- Well,
you could let him win, dad.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.729
- Why would I do that?
- Because he's ten.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.698
- So we're gonna let him think
he's better than he is?

06:39.700 --> 06:40.932
How will real life feel?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.701
- He'll be an adult
in real life,

06:42.703 --> 06:44.469
So it will feel fine.
- Checkmate.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.004
- Daddy, please make me
a cappuccino.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.839
- I would, whit, if I
could work out how to use this--

06:47.841 --> 06:49.708

It's a very temperamental

Miranda, would you please--

06:58.519 --> 07:00.185
- Cappuccino or espresso?

07:00.187 --> 07:02.020
- Macchiato, please.
Thank you.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.189
- Oh, my god!
Miranda, the flowers!

07:04.191 --> 07:08.093
We completely, utterly, entirely
forgot to order flowers.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.861
- Oh, no.
- What are we gonna do?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.963
- Calm down. Just relax.
It's okay.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.599
Noah and I will go
to the farmer's market today.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.701
I'll get you some flowers,
and I'll arrange them for you.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.738
- Noah shouldn't have
to spend his Saturday like that.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.839
- He doesn't mind.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.474
Do you?

07:22.476 --> 07:23.775
- Not at all.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.877
- [laughs]
great!

07:29.048 --> 07:31.082
- How come ruby's hanging out
with us again?

07:31.084 --> 07:33.084
I thought you guys
said she was a bad influence.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.753
- 'cause she's a friend
of your sister's,

07:34.755 --> 07:36.788
And I think that she's
grown up a lot this year.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.989
- I heard she got expelled.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.991
- Is that true?
- No.

07:39.993 --> 07:43.495
She spent a little time
in rehab.

07:43.497 --> 07:44.863
- Horsies! Stop!

07:44.865 --> 07:45.931
I want to pet the horsie!

07:45.933 --> 07:47.933
- Uh, we can't stop now, honey,

07:47.935 --> 07:49.601
But on the way back we can.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.836
- But I want to pet the horsie!

07:50.838 --> 07:53.605
- You will. I promise.
On the way back.

07:53.607 --> 07:57.008
I used to ride there
when I was a little girl.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.145
- Do you know how many times
you've told me that?

08:00.147 --> 08:04.182
- Well, you repeat things too,
you know.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.487
There's a really nice woman
that ran that ranch.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.088
She had four boys.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.257
They must be all grown up
by now.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.059
- Mm. I knew that.

[pop music on radio]

08:16.830 --> 08:18.263

something white.

- Disaster.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.235
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.571
- Would you like
to try a sample?

08:59.573 --> 09:02.007
- Yes.
- Okay.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.809
This one is strawberry-peach.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.279
How do you like it?
Better than the blueberry?

09:07.281 --> 09:09.080
- Hm.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.583
- And this one...
- How are you?

09:12.618 --> 09:14.152
- I'm fine.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.589
- How do you like it?
- Mm-hmm.

09:17.591 --> 09:21.126
- I've been, uh...
A bit worried about you, uh--

09:23.597 --> 09:25.096
- Not really.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.200
- Apples?
- Yes, it has apples in it,

But there's also
a secret ingredient.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.004
- Cinnamon?
- Yes.

So you want one?

- Sure, honey. Yeah.

uh, keep the change.

But you were very young,
so you probably don't remember.

good enough,

- This is helen.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.115
- Ma'am.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.718
Well, you're not qualified,

11:59.720 --> 12:01.186
But you are first,

12:01.188 --> 12:02.353
And that does count
for something.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.122
So I'll tell you what.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.424
Why don't you spend a couple
more hours here with us today,

12:06.426 --> 12:08.126
If it's all right
with your folks.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.061
I'll teach you how to brush
a horse, polish a saddle.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.496
See if you got the stuff.
- Can I?

12:11.498 --> 12:13.765
- Yeah, sure.
- No, I don't know, I don't--

12:13.767 --> 12:14.799
- Yeah. Sure.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.234
- What about your parents'
party?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.769
- We'll just pick him up
later.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.804
He's excited.
It's like a miracle.

12:19.806 --> 12:20.905
Please?

12:23.309 --> 12:26.478
- Yeah. Great. Thanks.
- It's my pleasure, sir.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.946
I like your boy.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.181
All right.
First lesson.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.984
Take those into the barn.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.758
- You folks want to head up?

12:44.964 --> 12:47.966
- Everyone says to you when
you're young, "who do you love?

12:47.968 --> 12:52.303
Love is all you need,"
and it sends you into a panic.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.039
At least it did for me.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.374
My mother had just died,

12:56.376 --> 12:59.377
And my father
was drinking himself to death.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.380
My sister had taken off
for nepal with some sherpa,

13:02.382 --> 13:06.785
And I thought, "who do I love?
Who do I even have?"

13:08.120 --> 13:10.121
I had helen.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.992
I popped the question the night
we graduated college.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.527
None of my family had come,

13:15.529 --> 13:17.095
But helen's parents
took us both out

13:17.097 --> 13:18.863
To the nicest restaurant
in town,

13:18.865 --> 13:23.501
And her dad
bought a $200 bottle of wine...

13:23.503 --> 13:26.371
And afterwards all our friends
were so excited.

13:26.373 --> 13:29.240
She felt like
some sort of princess,

13:29.242 --> 13:32.177
And I felt like...Such a man.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.979
[chuckles]

13:34.981 --> 13:36.915
- Why are you laughing?

13:36.917 --> 13:38.283
- Oh, nothing.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.251
Just for some reason
that strikes me as funny,

13:40.253 --> 13:43.221
Thinking about that now.

13:49.228 --> 13:52.931
- I made you some lunch.

13:52.933 --> 13:56.067
- Oh, thanks.
- How's it going?

13:56.069 --> 14:00.338
- Badly.
- Oh. What's wrong?

14:00.340 --> 14:03.308
- Uh, I'm not inspired,
helen, I'm...

14:03.310 --> 14:05.276
I'm bored.
- Oh...

14:05.278 --> 14:06.611
I'm sorry.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.280
I'll try not to
take that personally.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.928
- This is delicious.
What is it?

14:23.930 --> 14:29.601
And some of that jam
you got at the farmer's market.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.569
Which dress?

14:31.571 --> 14:34.405
- Um...That one.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.443
- I think I'm gonna wear
this one.

14:46.051 --> 14:49.287
[overlapping chatter]

14:55.094 --> 14:56.327
- Whitney?
- Hey.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.162
- Whitney!
- What?

14:58.164 --> 15:00.365
- Come here.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.101
Where is the rest of
your dress?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.602
- Dad.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.904
- Go change.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.572
- I don't have
anything else to wear.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.507
- Then stay in your room.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.910
- Thanks a lot, dad.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.915
- Ruby, you can't drink.
You're 16.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.453
- It's apple juice.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.261
- Something totally fucked up
is happening.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.531
- What?
What is it?

15:33.533 --> 15:37.135
- Something totally fucked up is
going on, that's what.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.573
All right. See that lady
with the witchy hair

15:42.575 --> 15:44.409
And the long dre--don't look!

15:44.411 --> 15:45.476
- Well,
how am I supposed to see--

15:45.478 --> 15:47.145
- That's her.
- Who?

15:47.147 --> 15:48.680
- The piano teacher.

15:48.682 --> 15:51.215
- Who? The one your dad
had the affair with?

15:51.217 --> 15:52.684
- Yeah.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.519
- What was the name, maria?
- Theresa.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.421
- Theresa. I knew it was
something catholic.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.022
- What is she doing here?

15:58.024 --> 16:00.024
Do you think he invited her?
- Why would he do that?

16:00.026 --> 16:02.694
- 'cause he's a dick,
or hadn't you noticed?

16:02.696 --> 16:04.462
- Yeah.
- That's a rhetorical question.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.664
Don't answer it.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.701
What am I gonna do?
I don't want my mom to see her.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.402
- Did your mom know?
- Yeah, she knew.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.304
I mean, she didn't know,
but she knew.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.440
It--she knew.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.008
It's--oh, fuck.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.177
I can't believe she came.
It's so unfair.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.511
My mother worked
so fucking hard

16:20.513 --> 16:22.246
To make everything perfect
for the party,

16:22.248 --> 16:25.283
And then he just comes in and he
shits all over everything.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.451
- It's okay. It's okay.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.686
It's okay.

16:53.545 --> 16:56.781
[mellow dinner music
playing]

16:56.783 --> 16:59.751
- First he was a writer,
then he was a blogger,

16:59.753 --> 17:02.220
And now he's waiting on tables
in astoria.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.421
I shit you not.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.756
Hey, harry!

17:04.758 --> 17:07.358
Harry, this is my son-in-law,
noah.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.427
This is harry, my agent.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.595
You're never gonna believe this,

17:10.597 --> 17:13.097
But he read your book.
- Really?

17:13.099 --> 17:15.767
- I told him to.
I said you weren't bad.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.668
- You did?
- Surprised, aren't you?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.203
You thought I didn't like it.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.506
That's part of your problem,
noah.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.776
You've got no faith in people.

17:24.778 --> 17:27.378
- Well, not everyone
is as magnanimous as you, bruce.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.247
[men chuckling]
- so bruce tells me

17:29.249 --> 17:31.382
That you're working on
something new this summer?

17:31.384 --> 17:33.484
- That's right.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.520
- So what's it about?

17:35.522 --> 17:39.190
- Uh, well, I haven't really
gotten too far with it yet.

17:39.192 --> 17:42.827
It's, uh, it's sort
of in the research phase.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.165
Well, I'm thinking of setting
it out here on the island.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.534
- Come on, noah.
Harry here's a big deal.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.369
You're gonna
have to sell yourself

17:51.371 --> 17:52.503
A little harder than that.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.505
- What are we talking about?

17:54.507 --> 17:56.707
- Noah's new book.
- Wow. Great.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.810
I didn't know there was
enough to talk about yet.

17:58.812 --> 18:00.678
- There isn't really.
- I'm trying to convince

18:00.680 --> 18:03.281
Harry here to take him on.
- That would be incredible.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.817
- But the kid isn't giving us
much to work with.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.652
- Well, noah doesn't like
to talk about his work

18:07.654 --> 18:09.687
Before he starts writing.
- That's understandable.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.722
- But I'm getting the sense
that this next book--

18:11.724 --> 18:13.291
If it's okay to say--

18:13.293 --> 18:16.094
Is, um, gonna be
a little bit more commercial.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.129
You know?
If that's not a bad word.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.698
Still incredibly smart.
Just a little more accessible.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.266
- He liked the first book,
helen.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.668
- Yeah, well,
because it was brilliant,

18:23.670 --> 18:26.571
But, um, this house
just publishes

18:26.573 --> 18:29.140
Bigger feeling bo--books.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.441
- Excuse me, sir.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.143
You order whiskey?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.814
- Thank you.

18:40.819 --> 18:44.455
- I think that's the girl
from the lobster roll.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.557
- Hm?
- The waitress.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.526
The day stacey choked.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.661
- Oh, was it?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.897
- Is she flirting with you?

18:52.899 --> 18:55.533
- Of course
she was flirting with him.

18:55.535 --> 18:56.667
[chuckles]

18:56.669 --> 18:58.202
If I had an ass like hers,

18:58.204 --> 19:00.138
I'd do exactly
the same thing--

19:00.140 --> 19:02.173
Wear a tight dress
to a nice party,

19:02.175 --> 19:05.309
Try to find some poor schmuck
to take me home.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.611
[men laughing]

19:06.613 --> 19:10.615
- Did you just call me
a schmuck, bruce?

19:10.617 --> 19:13.351
- Did I? I didn't mean to.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.220
- But you did call the waitress
a whore though, right?

19:16.222 --> 19:17.655
- Noah.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.894
- I need to get a, uh, refill.

19:22.896 --> 19:26.330
Can I get anyone anything?
No? Excuse me.

20:10.275 --> 20:13.711
[muted background chatter]

20:19.818 --> 20:22.653
Hey!

20:22.655 --> 20:24.388
- Hey.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.325
- Hey.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.626
- How are you?

20:29.761 --> 20:32.430
- I'm good.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.764
How are you?

20:33.766 --> 20:36.767
- [hoarsely]
yeah. I'm better now.

20:39.805 --> 20:42.807
- You know, you really
shouldn't smoke that here.

20:42.809 --> 20:46.410
They'll smell it in the kitchen.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.780
- Okay.
Where should we go?

20:54.620 --> 20:58.956
[muted background chatter]

21:08.834 --> 21:10.868
Forgot the code?
- I hope not.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.503
It's my wife's birthday.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.438
- [laughs]

21:14.440 --> 21:15.606
Oh...

21:15.608 --> 21:19.343
[distant laughter]

21:19.345 --> 21:20.678
[laughing]
no.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.448
[click]
- wrong year.

21:31.323 --> 21:35.459
[surf crashing]

21:38.697 --> 21:40.931
[noah laughs]

21:58.050 --> 22:00.885
- [faintly under surf]
join me!

22:02.521 --> 22:03.888
- What?

22:03.890 --> 22:06.991
- It's beautiful!

22:26.678 --> 22:29.714
- So you're having trouble
with your new book?

22:29.716 --> 22:32.049
- A little.
- Because you wrote about

22:32.051 --> 22:34.952
Everything that ever happened
in the first book,

22:34.954 --> 22:37.588
And now you have nothing else
to write about.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.023
- Is it that obvious?

22:39.025 --> 22:40.725
- You know what I
think you should do?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.493
- What?
- Forget about the book

22:42.495 --> 22:44.128
For a while.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.097
You came out here
to take a vacation, right?

22:46.099 --> 22:49.533
- No, I came out here
to finish my book.

22:50.902 --> 22:54.105
- Well, maybe you
should try living a little...

22:56.508 --> 22:59.377
And then you'll have something
to write about.

23:08.987 --> 23:10.588
- When I saw you this morning,

23:10.590 --> 23:13.124
You didn't want to have anything
to do with me.

23:13.126 --> 23:15.526
- You were with your daughter.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.863
- [sighs]

23:18.865 --> 23:20.464
I'm married.

23:20.466 --> 23:21.599
- [laughs]
okay.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.100
- You know what that means?

23:23.102 --> 23:25.903
- Well, marriage means different
things to different people.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.140
- No, no. Not to me.
To me it means...

23:29.142 --> 23:31.909
Nothing can happen between us.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.814
- You're serious?

23:36.816 --> 23:38.816
- I'm very serious.

23:43.622 --> 23:44.955
- Okay.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.893
In that case,

23:48.895 --> 23:51.796
It was nice meeting you,
noah solloway.

23:56.034 --> 23:57.601
- You too, alison...

23:57.603 --> 23:58.869
- Lockhart.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.171
- Like the ranch?

24:00.173 --> 24:04.108
- Yeah.
It belongs to my husband.

24:05.076 --> 24:07.445
- You're married too?

24:07.447 --> 24:09.914
- [laughs]
that's right.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.618
Surprise.

24:38.677 --> 24:42.480
- What the fuck was that?

24:45.484 --> 24:50.087
- What happened later
that night?

24:50.089 --> 24:52.189
- Nothing, man.
I, uh...

24:52.191 --> 24:55.793
Apologized to my father-in-law
and...

24:55.795 --> 24:58.496
Went to sleep with my wife.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.640
Can I ask you a question?

25:09.642 --> 25:11.008
- Of course.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.010
- How is any of this relevant
to what happened?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.845
- It may not be, mr. Solloway.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.914
I'm just gathering a little
background on the people

25:16.916 --> 25:20.217
Who knew the victim and how
they're connected to each other.

25:20.219 --> 25:23.821
- Trying to figure out if anyone
might have had a motive

25:23.823 --> 25:26.290
To kill this fella.

25:27.859 --> 25:30.528
- I thought it was an accident.

25:49.814 --> 25:51.148
- I'm sorry, I--

25:51.150 --> 25:54.118
I didn't know
your wife's birthday.

27:00.318 --> 27:01.986
- Hey, will.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.754
How was the night?

27:03.756 --> 27:05.022
- I'm fucking beat, ali.

27:05.024 --> 27:08.292
