WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:03.879
Next item is Friday's
alumni dance.

00:04.171 --> 00:05.422
How's that progressing?

00:05.714 --> 00:07.466
I've emailed ever former student

00:07.758 --> 00:09.468
who's not in prison or jail.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.154
Everyone, remember,
there's a difference.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.180
Our alumni are touchy
about that.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.515
What's the difference?

00:14.806 --> 00:16.475
You go to jail
if a cop doesn't like you.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.228
They can't send you to prison
without knowing you're poor.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.000
Do you believe half
your own politics?

00:21.188 --> 00:23.190
Yeah.

00:23.482 --> 00:24.482
Yeah.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.044
I'm still trying to find
a good deejay,

00:26.068 --> 00:28.108
by which I mean figure out
what makes a deejay good.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.447
Or bad. Or different
from a phone or laptop.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.049
Chang, how's it going
with the PowerPoint

00:32.073 --> 00:33.234
for the city council meeting?

00:33.450 --> 00:34.576
Good question.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.044 --> 00:46.255
When you asked
if I knew PowerPoint,

00:46.547 --> 00:47.839
I said...

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
"Yes."

00:51.009 --> 00:52.928
But what did I really mean?

00:53.220 --> 00:55.806
These are yeses and noes
in a chart.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.475
They appear to be the same.
However...

01:03.397 --> 01:04.982
I think you'll find...

01:13.824 --> 01:16.201
that within some eggs...

01:17.327 --> 01:19.079
is the truth.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.209
That should have been
a dollar bill.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.378
But I'm no magician.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.797
I'm just a guy
that knows PowerPoint.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.551
Okay, pushing that meeting.

01:32.843 --> 01:36.722
In other news, campuses across the
country, including this area,

01:37.014 --> 01:39.933
have been seeing a dramatic
rise in guerilla marketing.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.786
Why do they need marketing?
They're amazing.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.853
Guerilla with a U. Got it.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.022
I'm talking about
undercover advertisers

01:45.314 --> 01:48.609
that blend in with the public while
covertly marketing certain products.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.028
They can advertise things
without you knowing?

01:51.320 --> 01:53.488
Is that legal? It sounds
like brain windexing.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.532
It is legal,
and it's mostly harmless,

01:55.824 --> 01:57.344
but I would like
to protect some of our

01:57.534 --> 01:58.785
more impressionable students

01:59.077 --> 02:00.454
from being unduly influenced,

02:00.746 --> 02:03.373
so if you see anything,
let the Dean know.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.334
Okay, don't freak out.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.145
Someone just told me
that Honda has released

02:07.169 --> 02:09.713
some kind of super vehicle
called the Honda Fit.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.174
It's a small car
with a big personality

02:12.466 --> 02:15.385
that can handle anything
life throws at you.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.196
Why am I standing here
talking about it?

02:17.220 --> 02:19.180
I have to find a Honda dealer,
school is canceled.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.464
The Honda Fit! It's happening!

02:20.599 --> 02:21.975
It's finally happening!

02:22.267 --> 02:23.828
I'm just going to give
the school's assets

02:23.852 --> 02:25.020
a quick freezie-weezie.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.313
Is this meeting over?

02:26.605 --> 02:29.066
I think so, but sometimes
we just hang out

02:29.358 --> 02:30.692
and say funny... stuff.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.569
Have fun with that. Oh.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.407
Guys,

02:37.699 --> 02:40.494
do you feel
like Elroy doesn't like us

02:40.786 --> 02:42.496
as much as we like him
and each other?

02:42.788 --> 02:44.057
He probably doesn't know
his role yet.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.291
I mean, is he Black Pierce,
Old Troy,

02:46.583 --> 02:48.418
or Shirley Without
a Giant Purse?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.605
I haven't exactly been a whirlwind
of entertainment since Troy left.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.029
That's not true.
No, you're amazing.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.775
It's not just me, You guys
have been boring, too.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.550
Okay, I just gotta ask,
what was so special

02:55.842 --> 02:58.387
about this Troy person,
did he own a rainbow,

02:58.679 --> 03:00.347
was he the group's pharmacist?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.099
We don't like to talk about it.

03:02.391 --> 03:03.684
But you often do.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.645
I'm a problem solver,
give me information.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.438
I'll handle this.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.191
Troy was very gifted
at steel drums.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.946
Steel drums. Interesting.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.989
Well, this has been
a great meeting.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.783
I'm off.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.910
That won't pay off immediately,

03:22.202 --> 03:24.246
- but it's gonna pay off.
- And that, Jeff,

03:24.538 --> 03:25.914
is the truth.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.587
Did you lose the egg you
put the dollar bill in?

03:32.879 --> 03:35.257
That's how it works?

03:35.549 --> 03:38.385
♪ Give me some rope
Tie me to dream

03:38.677 --> 03:41.763
♪ Give me the hope
to run out of steam

03:42.055 --> 03:45.016
♪ Somebody said it can be here

03:45.308 --> 03:49.020
♪ We could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year

03:49.312 --> 03:53.692
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay

03:53.984 --> 03:57.779
♪ One by one they all
just fade away ♪

04:04.411 --> 04:06.788
Britta, remember that guy
who you were in love with,

04:07.080 --> 04:08.457
but your love was torn asunder

04:08.749 --> 04:10.143
because he was
the human incarnation

04:10.167 --> 04:12.002
of a certain sandwich franchise?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.294
Sub... Don't say it.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.047
Don't ever say that name
without compensation.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.216
I know how much
that experience hurt you,

04:18.507 --> 04:19.760
which is why I'm warning you

04:20.051 --> 04:21.529
that I just saw him
in the parking lot.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.929
Breathe.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.658
The self-destructive part of you
wants to run straight to him,

04:25.682 --> 04:27.976
but we need to be smarter
than that, right? Right.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.268
Thank you, Annie.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.599
Now, I have one more class,

04:30.729 --> 04:32.355
but if you can wait

04:32.647 --> 04:33.690
I will meet you...

04:35.609 --> 04:36.985
Nuh-uh.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.237
See, I don't just fling
myself into the wild.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.239
The hub of a quality
camping experience

04:41.531 --> 04:43.575
is a safe and reliable
generator.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.078
Uh, you know what? Um,

04:47.370 --> 04:48.639
I'll talk to you girls later,
all right?

04:48.663 --> 04:50.499
Stay inventive and enthusiastic.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.709
Thank you. Britta.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.086
Su... No, no, no, no.
That's my sandwich name.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.922
I'm my own man, now.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.925
I'm a free, reliable,
quality man...

05:00.217 --> 05:02.093
named Rick. Hi, Rick.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.929
That's for half of my heart.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.639
And that's for the other half.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.307
And this is for being the reason

05:07.599 --> 05:09.309
there's two halves of my heart.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.120
Can you actually crouch
down a little bit

05:11.144 --> 05:12.497
'cause your taller
than my instructor

05:12.521 --> 05:13.688
and I'm only a yellow belt.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.020
No, Britta. It took me this
long to gain my freedom.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.734
I never stopped
thinking about you.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.706
And you touched me
in ways no one ever has.

05:19.778 --> 05:20.779
Nice.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.240
I came back for you.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.699
You did?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.451
Hey, Rick.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.119
Look what I got.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.538
Ho, ho, great, Dean.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.872
Yeah.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.999
But, uh...
where's your Honda Fit?

05:33.291 --> 05:34.417
Oh, I drive a CR-V.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.795
And the Fit combines
the efficiency of a subcompact

05:37.087 --> 05:39.287
with the versatility to take
whatever life throws at it.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.216
Yeah, that's what you said,
that's me.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.385
Can the CR-V not take
what life throws at it?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.804
Yeah, but the CR-V
adds durability and storage.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.431
Okay. That makes sense.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.226
I bet my bank
has a grace period.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.020
I'm going to get a CR-V.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.314
Dean, dean.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.441
Are you guerilla marketing
for Honda?

05:58.733 --> 06:00.777
Shh! You're not
allowed to know that.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.529
I'm useless to Honda
if anyone knows.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.156
Unbelievable, it's the
same story all over again.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.528
I disagree. You know, I think
it's a whole new story.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.287
I have a beard now,
and an identity.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.038
Selling Hondas is just my job.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.611
And they make great products
that I'd want to sell anyway.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.085
So can you have a girlfriend?

06:17.377 --> 06:21.089
That's what I thought. Then see you around.
As a friend.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.216
As a friend, Britta,

06:23.508 --> 06:26.136
can I at least show you
the CR-V's easy-fold down

06:26.428 --> 06:27.762
60/40 split-rear seat?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.764
For 15 minutes.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.308
Then friends for real.

06:36.104 --> 06:39.107
Great news! The steel
drum thing paid off.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.879
We invited Elroy to meet us in
the study room for a game night.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.403
He said yes! Ah!

06:43.695 --> 06:45.381
Are you gonna play "Pretty
Please Will You Like Us More?"

06:45.405 --> 06:46.740
That'll warm him up. Better.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.409
In celebration of Elroy's life
peaking in the early '90s,

06:49.701 --> 06:51.036
The Ears Have It.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.888
The classic game of
whose ears you have,

06:53.163 --> 06:55.016
which ears have it and
whether you have those ears.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.042
Meow.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.630
We're workshopping
new handshakes.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.424
You guys realize you're just
reinforcing his aloofness?

07:04.716 --> 07:05.902
If you want someone to like you,

07:05.926 --> 07:07.006
you don't get to know them.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.238
You sit back and wait for them
to notice you're cool.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.639
What are you, 13?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.909
- What's the age limit on The Ears Have It?
- Seven and up.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.351
Then I'm six. Ugh.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.983
I will say you've become
more reliable and durable.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.486
Oh, I hope we can do this again.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.614
No, Rick.
I want a normal relationship.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.033
I want to experience
brunch in public.

07:30.325 --> 07:33.370
I want a non-financial reason
to text my parents.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.342
I want to tell another person
how to dress.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.665
We can have a relationship.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.559
We just have to follow
a few simple rules.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.168
Rick?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.379
Are you in there?
You have to hide.

07:42.671 --> 07:43.791
The windows are fogged over.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.591
Are you napping heavily?
I can't hide forever.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.176
No, but you can hide in comfort.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.512
There's 35.2 cubic feet
of cargo space back here.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.846
Please, Britta.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.264
Damn it!

07:54.891 --> 07:56.309
Ah.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.478
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.355
Ta-da!

08:00.647 --> 08:02.941
Why choose when you can
Hond-oose?

08:03.233 --> 08:05.360
Oh, and that blower.
That was just an impulse buy.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.279
Wow, Dean, you know, one
vehicle's enough for one person.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.864
I guess I know that in my head,

08:10.156 --> 08:11.449
but I can't shake this fear

08:11.741 --> 08:15.453
of losing even one small part
of what Honda has to offer.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.956
My God. You're a Level
Seven Susceptible.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.499
A what? Uh, nothing.

08:19.791 --> 08:20.792
Nothing, I... Look, Rick.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.544
Whatever that is,
you can tell me.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.962
I'm on board.

08:25.755 --> 08:26.755
Yes.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.049
Hmm.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.176
Yes, you are.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.436
Am I found in Africa?

08:39.727 --> 08:42.272
Yes and San Diego and the Bronx.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.274
- A woman?
- Am I large?

08:44.566 --> 08:46.735
Am I an elephant?

08:47.652 --> 08:48.987
I was thinking dolphin

08:49.279 --> 08:50.559
but I knew they didn't have ears

08:50.739 --> 08:53.033
because my dentist has a
poster of one on the ceiling

08:53.324 --> 08:54.659
and I recently had a root canal.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.015
Hey, party people. I could hear
you all the way down the hall.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.808
We're playing The Ears Have It.
Chang's ahead by three pair.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.125
With an asterisk. I'm cheating.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.228
Here, you can have my spot.
I should... I should leave.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.129
Whoa! ANNIE: Oh, no! Oh, no!

09:06.421 --> 09:07.964
Well, fun hanging out
with you, Elroy.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.776
We know you have
your choice of friends

09:09.883 --> 09:11.468
and we thank you
for choosing us.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.094
Easy choice to make.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.140
See? Told ya.

09:17.432 --> 09:21.019
"Elroy doesn't like us, what are
we gonna do?" You guys are goofs.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.771
Yeah. We were silly.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.457
I got up to make nachos,
and Elroy said

09:24.481 --> 09:26.399
that was "not-cho" job, and we laughed.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.731
Then he made them for me.
It was more than wordplay.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.862
It really wasn't my job
in his eyes.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.239
I hadn't seen that
side of him until now.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.866
He had a great time.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.826
Until Jeff showed up.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.398
Maybe he just doesn't like Jeff.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.081
Okay, my deal, Boston rules.
Two up, one down,

09:41.372 --> 09:43.212
elf ears are wild,
joker ears are regular ears,

09:43.249 --> 09:44.769
ears go cold once
they're off the head,

09:44.793 --> 09:46.169
rat ears are an automatic loss,

09:46.461 --> 09:48.647
no peeking, sniffing, or grunting,
and no asking "do I have lobes."

09:48.671 --> 09:50.441
- Chang's ahead by three pair.
- With an asterisk.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.817
It's not true, you know?
Oh, it is.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.343
I cheat my ass off
at everything.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.529
I'm cheating at a game
of hide and seek right now.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.198
We weren't supposed
to leave the rec center.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.640
Okay, let's do this.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.391
Extra cards.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.478
Stupid sink!

10:03.770 --> 10:05.355
Every time!

10:05.647 --> 10:08.316
Mother! I hate... oh!

10:09.234 --> 10:10.860
Oh! No rush.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.613
Hi. What do you need?

10:13.905 --> 10:15.281
A club soda, please.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.384
How about a little something
in there to keep it company?

10:17.408 --> 10:18.408
What do you recommend?

10:18.660 --> 10:20.495
Well, scotch and soda
is a classic.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.956
This one's okay.
We just got this one in.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.582
It's got a pig on the bottle.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.502
But this one,
this one's really good.

10:27.794 --> 10:31.047
It's aged eight years,
smoky, from Scotland.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.216
A little pricier but worth it.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.760
I drink this one when I've
got a reason to celebrate.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.054
Well then, I will take that one.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.906
I think I've got
something to celebrate.

10:39.931 --> 10:40.931
Oh yeah, what's that?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.143
She's good.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.979
What are you doing here?

10:46.271 --> 10:49.023
Britta, this is my boss.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.692
From Honda?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.903
In public you will refer to us as
"Hilary" from now on. Continue.

10:54.195 --> 10:57.240
There's a program we can be in where
we covertly market as a team.

10:57.532 --> 11:00.326
We can be a couple
in a relationship in public.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.537
We can walk down the street
holding hands.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.249
If I take a job tricking people
into buying things they don't want.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.960
Do you enjoy billboards
and commercials, Miss Perry?

11:09.252 --> 11:12.881
You mean shill-boards
and con-mercials?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.424
No, I don't.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.509
I detest them.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.363
They are unmanned bulldozers rolling
over everything in their path.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.306
What Rick does is surgical.

11:21.598 --> 11:24.976
He finds that part of each
life that Honda can improve

11:25.268 --> 11:29.314
and gently bathes it in the most
helpful information possible.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.941
I don't think you understand
how surgery works.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.651
I came in here
to get a club soda.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.823
Right now I am drinking
probably the best scotch

11:36.112 --> 11:38.114
I've had in years.
Did you trick me?

11:38.823 --> 11:40.033
Am I suffering?

11:42.493 --> 11:43.786
Do you love this man?

11:44.954 --> 11:46.289
I do.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.666
Then I pronounce you
a highly influential couple.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.627
You may kiss your boyfriend.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.384
Wait, where'd he go? Well,
that's not for us to understand.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.138
Well, okay,
but he's right there.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.983
Hi, Todd. Hey, guys.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.275
Mind if we sit with you?
Oh, yeah. That'd be great.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.823
I have to say you guys
seem very happy together.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.283
Well, we have our moments.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.744
I'm excited because we're
going antiquing this weekend.

12:25.036 --> 12:28.456
I love antiquing.
Everything is so old.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.228
I like it, too.
You said you hated it.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.793
I hated finding these treasures

12:32.085 --> 12:33.646
and not being able
to fit them in the car.

12:33.670 --> 12:34.754
Now I got a CR-V.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.589
CR-V? Yeah, Rick's new Honda.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.258
He won't shut up about it.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.717
It's kind of a game-changer.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.552
It's certainly
a sex-life changer.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.513
Sorry.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.848
We're being obnoxious.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.267
So what have you been up to?

12:47.558 --> 12:50.728
I don't remember. CR-V, you say?

12:51.020 --> 12:53.231
CR-V. CR-V.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.860
You're amazing. You're amazing.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.612
Honda's amazing.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.906
I want you to meet my parents.
Yes.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.617
Honda...

13:04.909 --> 13:06.369
Look, Britta's in love.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.514
Yep. ELROY: He must
be a very special young man.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.833
I bet they'll be together
for a very long time.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.965
You got her pegged, man. Pegged.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.633
Oh, hey, Jeff. Hey.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.302
Hey, here. You can have my seat.

13:22.593 --> 13:23.633
I was just going to class.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.720
Oh, wait, before you go.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.640
I know you have every one
of Natalie is Freezing CDs,

13:27.932 --> 13:30.310
but Abed found some songs
by them online that they did

13:30.601 --> 13:32.603
for a charity album
for homeless skateboarders.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.357
Plastic Doll Parts,
Wallpaper Chrysalis,

13:36.649 --> 13:38.568
Weird Blanket.

13:38.860 --> 13:39.860
I've never heard these.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.779
This is great. Thanks.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.490
Hey, stay away
from that mechanic.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.342
Unless I need a wrench
made of licorice.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.417
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
Inside joke.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.169
Man, I'm like a fart
to that guy.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.661
He can't get away fast enough.

13:57.795 --> 14:01.090
What? No. I mean, maybe.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.942
What the hell happened
at that Ears game

14:03.134 --> 14:04.374
that made him like you so much?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.155
A few brief moments
of human vulnerability.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.388
Not really your wheelhouse.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.307
Oh, I'm sure you have
detailed files

14:09.599 --> 14:10.933
on human vulnerability, Abed.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.310
What... oh!

14:12.602 --> 14:14.330
- Whoa, take a knee, man.
- He's right, Jeff.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.832
If you want Elroy to like you, maybe
you need to put yourself out there.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.609
You mean bribe him with gifts,

14:19.901 --> 14:22.111
like your Natasha Freezes CD?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.988
Natalie is Freezing.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.115
Ugh. Natalie is Freezing.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.659
Natalie is Freezing.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.161
Mmm-hmm. Natalie is Freezing,

14:30.453 --> 14:32.133
Natalie is Freezing,
Natalie is Freezing...

14:35.750 --> 14:37.001
What is this?

14:39.045 --> 14:40.838
I don't know. I...

14:43.883 --> 14:45.468
I don't know.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.845
Honda. The power of dreams.

14:48.137 --> 14:51.307
Dean Pelton, I know how susceptible
you are to advertising.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.726
Would you say I'm a Level
Seven Susceptible? No.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.019
Because why would I?

14:55.311 --> 14:56.979
Because that's moon man talk.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.399
You mentioned a new kid earlier

14:59.690 --> 15:01.651
who told you about
the new Honda Fit.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.111
Rick. Britta's boyfriend?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.279
Yeah. But he's not... no.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.656
He's a good man.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.784
And he wouldn't secretly
be working for Honda

15:10.076 --> 15:12.036
because when we first met,
he was secretly working

15:12.078 --> 15:14.789
for a completely different
company.

15:15.081 --> 15:19.001
Are you...
I don't know how to...

15:19.293 --> 15:21.671
I have a rule about
being constructive,

15:21.963 --> 15:23.506
so I can't ask
any questions right now

15:23.798 --> 15:25.943
because all the questions that I
have right now are rhetorical

15:25.967 --> 15:27.468
and they end
with the word idiot.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.220
Do you know what a rhetorical...

15:29.512 --> 15:31.615
no, of course you don't know what
that is, you're an idiot...

15:31.639 --> 15:33.015
I'm sorry.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.477
I am so sorry,
but you're so stupid.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.729
You have no idea,
and you're the only one

15:39.021 --> 15:40.481
who has no idea,
because guess why.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.692
Don't answer that.
You'll get it wrong.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.319
Aw, so dumb. You're
just a dumb little man

15:45.611 --> 15:47.491
who tries to destroy
this school every minute...

15:47.697 --> 15:49.949
I am sorry!

15:50.241 --> 15:52.160
I'm so sorry.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.499
Oh! Oh, it's okay.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.002
I mean it's not okay, but... shh.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.545
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.630
Oh, so stupid.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.632
Oh, shh, shh, shh.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.010
Such a dummy.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.054
We are just so thrilled
that you brought a friend.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.890
Thrilled.
And it is "friend," then?

16:14.182 --> 16:16.392
I mean,
is that the correct moniker?

16:16.684 --> 16:19.103
Boyfriend.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.231
This is... well that's... whoa!
This is very exciting.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.923
Boy, you could just bowl me over
with one of those, um, uh...

16:25.026 --> 16:26.626
sweetheart, you know,
what are the, uh...

16:26.861 --> 16:28.362
you remember
at the Johnson's cabin...

16:28.654 --> 16:29.654
Feathers.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.449
You could bowl me over
with a feather.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.661
Well, you have a lovely home.
I love this carpet.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.662
It reminds me of the quality
floor mats in my Honda CR-V.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.789
Oh, come on, sweetie,
that's not necessary.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.000
You refer to your floor mats
as "quality."

16:41.292 --> 16:44.921
I've never heard that level
of floor-mat enthusiasm.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.333
Should we be caring more about
our floor mats, George?

16:47.548 --> 16:49.508
I don't think we need to
jump to conclusions, Deb.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.870
Just let the man
finish his story.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.492
They're floor mats,
that's the story.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.722
Hey, what's this? What's that?
Look all around.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.265
There's things all around us.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.237
Would you like to see a movie?
We have one.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.853
What is it, George? It's, uh,
it's the, uh... The Aviator!

17:01.145 --> 17:02.313
N-no... The Avatar.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.273
Uh, no, thank you. That movie
is three hours of puke.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.575
Of course, Britta's joking.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.453
We enjoy Avatar very much.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.413
We do? Yes.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.374
It's an immensely popular movie.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.084
Of course, we love it.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.838
How many alumni have responded?

17:28.130 --> 17:29.882
Not many, but I think
our current students

17:30.174 --> 17:31.534
will show up
for the degree raffle.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.903
How 'bout we put
the deejay over there?

17:32.927 --> 17:34.220
You're not gonna need a deejay.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.532
I've been saying that since the
invention of the shuffle button.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.308
I have booked a surprise
musical guest this evening...

17:39.600 --> 17:41.519
a little piece of '90s nostalgia

17:41.811 --> 17:44.772
you might call
Natalie is Freezing.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.059
Are you out of your damn mind?

17:50.236 --> 17:51.404
What? You know this band?

17:51.696 --> 17:53.197
You know damn well I do.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.534
Why do you always... what... what, are
you trying to get me to like you?

17:56.826 --> 17:57.994
No. Good.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.579
'Cause it ain't working.

17:59.870 --> 18:03.374
You weird hair-gelled CPR dummy.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.376
It's pomade! Ah.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.713
As long as I'm up here, does
anyone want anything reached?

18:10.006 --> 18:11.048
Hey.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.466
We're Natalie is Freezing.

18:12.758 --> 18:13.759
Oh, are you Natalie?

18:14.051 --> 18:16.262
I'm Julie. The name of the
band is Natalie is Freezing.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.390
Why would anyone in the band be Natalie?
We're artists.

18:19.682 --> 18:20.891
Cool.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.703
So, our deejay was gonna man
the frozen yogurt machine.

18:22.727 --> 18:23.996
Is that something
that you guys can handle?

18:24.020 --> 18:26.897
If you do need anything
reached, I've been practicing.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.402
We like Avatar?

18:31.694 --> 18:34.989
In public, yes, we like
things most people like.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.824
Our job isn't
to alienate people.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.743
We're on the job
with my parents?

18:39.035 --> 18:41.912
With everyone,
everywhere, all the time.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.456
You wanted a relationship.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.583
A real one. It's real.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.555
Do you not think
Honda makes good products?

18:47.835 --> 18:48.835
Of course I do.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.671
That's never been
remotely in question,

18:50.963 --> 18:52.757
but why does that mean
that I like Avatar?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.609
Because you're not a
monster, all right?

18:54.675 --> 18:57.261
Because people don't want to
drive what a monster drives.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.097
Stop the Honda, Rick!
Do you hear me?

19:00.389 --> 19:01.589
Use a light press of your foot

19:01.724 --> 19:03.976
to engage the highly
responsive anti-lock brakes

19:04.268 --> 19:06.103
of this incredible vehicle, now!

19:09.649 --> 19:12.068
I want to be with you...
the real you.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.488
This is me. This is what I do.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.908
When I influence people
to buy Honda products...

19:19.950 --> 19:21.661
I feel God's pleasure.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.204
That's from Chariots of Fire.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.915
I love Chariots of Fire.
So do I.

19:27.833 --> 19:28.918
Also, we have to.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.254
Damn it, Britta!

19:33.923 --> 19:34.924
Oops.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.391
Aw, man,
you people are everywhere.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.017
I was looking for a place
to hide.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.061
Don't worry. I'm not
gonna bother you.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.980
Okay, then,

19:50.272 --> 19:52.066
give me a gin and tonic.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.615
Your friend Jeff booked Natalie
is Freezing for the dance.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.951
What? Tonight? We got to go!

20:02.243 --> 20:03.869
Why aren't you excited?

20:04.161 --> 20:05.246
I used to date her.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.123
Natalie?

20:07.415 --> 20:08.582
Her name is Julie.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.852
Why would the band's name
be her name? She's an artist.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.796
We listened to them together. You
never said anything about this.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.881
She messed me up.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.217
She messed me up pretty good.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.012
Here's to forgetting.
Not gonna toast to that.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.306
Well, then, forget you too.
Aw, give me a break.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.766
That's the whole problem.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.618
Everybody's in such a rush to
protect themselves from each other.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.396
Sure, yes, you got to
defend your castle,

20:30.688 --> 20:32.648
but you also got to...

20:32.940 --> 20:35.234
What's that thing
that castles have?

20:35.526 --> 20:36.819
Walls? Come on.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.191
A moat? Goes over the moat.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.114
Goes over the moat.
Enemy knights?

20:40.406 --> 20:41.741
Cavalry? Uh, arrows?

20:42.032 --> 20:44.410
No. Come on, stop it.
Goes like this.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.328
Alligators? No! It's one thing.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.260
It's mechanical.
One mechanical alligator!

20:48.539 --> 20:49.749
Are you screwing with me?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.727
I don't even know what
the hell you're talking about!

20:51.751 --> 20:54.545
It's one mechanical thing! It goes
over the moat! It goes like this!

20:54.837 --> 20:55.837
A catapult!

20:55.921 --> 20:57.241
Ow, Jesus!
W-What are you doing...

20:57.423 --> 20:59.759
Britta, I love you.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.093
I'm gonna quit Honda.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.471
I'll get a job, uh...

21:03.763 --> 21:06.140
I... I don't know,
what do regular people do?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.267
Well, they buy things.
I'll do that.

21:08.559 --> 21:09.852
For me? No, for Honda.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.021
Yes, for you!

21:12.313 --> 21:13.833
Normally, I would
give you a hard time,

21:14.023 --> 21:16.817
but I don't want
to be like this guy, so...

21:17.109 --> 21:18.629
Oh, you're coming...
I'm coming to you.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.058
You're coming over? Okay. You...

21:20.279 --> 21:21.999
Okay, that seems like
a really a hard way...

21:22.072 --> 21:23.967
Can you give me... okay, wait,
watch out for this foot, though.

21:23.991 --> 21:24.991
Okay. Okay.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.660
Hold on to me. Hold on to me.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.788
Oh, my God!

21:31.123 --> 21:33.000
Oh, wow. Uh, what do we do now?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.812
Uh, my school's having
a dance tonight.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.122
My favorite band is playing.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.254
Let's go!

21:41.217 --> 21:43.594
A drawbridge. A drawbridge!

21:53.813 --> 21:55.648
You need a drawbridge.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.229
It's Elroy's favorite band, too.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.868
Really? I once... I
once hallucinated

22:08.160 --> 22:10.996
one of their music videos in his RV.
That's weird.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.088
No, the Dean can't
introduce the band tonight.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.810
He's in his office, deciding
what kind of vehicles

22:14.834 --> 22:16.194
to buy for
the athletic department.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.087
Yeah, he needs a whole fleet.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.922
That's right, a fleet of vehicles.

22:20.214 --> 22:21.924
He just needs
to pick a model of car.

22:22.216 --> 22:23.696
He's in his office.
Did you hear that?

22:23.759 --> 22:25.886
Yes, I heard it, Rick,
but we're out of the game.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.972
Not yet. We can leave on a high.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.391
The Dean is a Level Seven
Susceptible, Britta.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.883
It's a once-in-a-lifetime feeling.
You won't believe it.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.146
I do believe it, but I don't need it.
Do you?

22:36.438 --> 22:39.024
I'll just do this one last
job, then we'll be free.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.530
Be right back.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.451
Guess I'm a Level Seven
Susceptible, too.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.431
Why do they assume somebody
is named Natalie in the band?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.057
It, like, happens all the time.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.029
Like, remember when we were in Syracuse...

23:15.394 --> 23:17.396
Elroy? Julie,

23:17.688 --> 23:19.648
you messed me up.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.780
You came after me,
because I wasn't interested.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.421
You got me interested,
and I fell hard.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.739
Then, you got bored
and destroyed me.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.366
And I've been afraid to love
anybody for 20 years since,

23:29.658 --> 23:30.658
but not anymore.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.494
Okay. I still love you.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.456
But I'm not gonna keep on hurting
others just because you hurt me.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.499
Fine. "Fine."

23:37.791 --> 23:40.169
That's you.
That's my impression of you,

23:40.461 --> 23:41.795
you jaded, hipster a-hole.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.714
I still love your music.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.342
Have a great gig.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.594
Elroy, I'm tired
of playing this game.

23:48.886 --> 23:51.138
I like you and I
want you to like me.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.100
Oh, okay.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.685
You're a good guy, Jeff Winger.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.354
You and I are gonna be friends.

23:58.646 --> 23:59.647
Okay, great. Whatever.

23:59.939 --> 24:00.981
I love you.

24:01.565 --> 24:02.691
I love you.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.944

24:06.695 --> 24:07.947

24:15.746 --> 24:17.122
Sorry, Britta.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.419
Britta,

24:22.711 --> 24:26.340
did you know your boyfriend was
guerilla marketing for Honda?

24:26.632 --> 24:29.843
I knew he represented
something I wanted to buy.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.304
I did good, Frankie.
Didn't I do good?

24:32.596 --> 24:35.099
Yes. Good Dean.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.725
Smart Dean.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.853
He'll be fine.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.605
But he can never come back here.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.023
I understand.

24:47.861 --> 24:51.490
Of course, if you want
to come with us...

24:51.782 --> 24:54.368
because you are good.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.412
I had nothing to do with it.

24:56.704 --> 25:00.374
The 2015 Honda CR-V
sells itself.

25:00.666 --> 25:04.712
That's why it's this year's Motor
Trend Sport/Utility of the Year.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.476
Oh, my.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.021
Where did he go?

25:22.855 --> 25:24.023
Thank you.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.692
Thank you.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.486
I know all of you
know this next one.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.929
So now I ask a question?
Mom does. We answer it.

26:37.221 --> 26:38.221
What am I? A rabbit.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.507
Obviously, you can't do that.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.996
Obviously you can't ask
what you are.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.183
Mom, change your ears.

26:42.392 --> 26:45.104
Okay, sweetie.
You didn't say that before.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.397
Dad, ask Mom a question
about your ears.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.525
I can't see my ears.
That's why you're asking!

26:49.817 --> 26:50.984
Okay, Deb, what are my ears?

26:51.276 --> 26:52.945
No! Like, "Am I an animal?"

26:53.237 --> 26:55.656
Well, yes! You are!
And so are you.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.367
Britta, whatever
happened to Rick?

26:58.659 --> 27:00.786
Oh, my God! Okay, okay.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.358
Ships in the night, I guess, eh?

27:02.454 --> 27:03.580
Why would you ask that?

27:03.872 --> 27:05.707
I came over here, because
Rick and I broke up.

27:05.999 --> 27:08.293
I know that. I just thought
maybe something had changed.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.003
While I was sitting here?

27:10.295 --> 27:12.095
Well, you know, these
days, with all the apps.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.257
Play the game!

27:13.549 --> 27:16.301
All right, which friend
of ours collects me?

27:16.593 --> 27:19.138
Joanne Schoenbuchner.
I'm elephants.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.640
Yes! Am I an animal?
How in the hell did...

27:21.932 --> 27:23.725
Aw, not by a long shot.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.520
Do I work in your office?

27:26.812 --> 27:28.572
Mom. GEORGE: Nathan in
accounts receivable...

27:28.772 --> 27:30.172
not his first wife,
his second wife.

27:30.399 --> 27:31.918
The one that made cake
for Memorial Day.

27:31.942 --> 27:35.112
Am I Mister Spock?
Yes, you are. That's it.

27:35.404 --> 27:36.604
I love this game. This is fun.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.490
Where... where...

27:38.782 --> 27:40.534
Ugh.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.205
I think we did something wrong.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.666
I know we did, Deb.
