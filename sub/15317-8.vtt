WEBVTT

00:01.967 --> 00:04.500
Uh, Magnus...

00:04.500 --> 00:05.700
I think I'm going to throw up!

00:05.700 --> 00:06.967
This is ridiculous!

00:06.967 --> 00:08.867
Hold on, I've lost lateral control!

00:12.067 --> 00:14.467
Okay, this is really not going well!

00:14.467 --> 00:15.700
I know!

00:15.700 --> 00:16.801
No lift.

00:16.801 --> 00:17.801
I can't get any altitude!

00:17.801 --> 00:20.867
Bloody hell!

00:20.867 --> 00:22.300
Try hitting it with more sedation!

00:22.300 --> 00:24.001
Yeah, I'm already doing that!

00:24.001 --> 00:25.400
What the hell is wrong with...

00:27.967 --> 00:29.700
Magnus...

00:31.700 --> 00:33.534
Magnus, pull up.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.534
I can't!

00:34.534 --> 00:36.734
Pull up now!

00:36.734 --> 00:37.867
Dammit!

00:37.867 --> 00:39.867
Oh, this is going to be nasty.

01:14.567 --> 01:16.001
Just... just come on.

01:16.001 --> 01:17.567
Just say it with me once...

01:17.567 --> 01:19.433
Reykjavik.

01:19.433 --> 01:20.567
I love that word.

01:20.567 --> 01:22.067
Yes, you've told me a dozen times.

01:22.067 --> 01:23.934
But I'm talking vodka, good food,

01:23.934 --> 01:25.168
fresh-faced women

01:25.168 --> 01:28.433
with names like "goodmansdottir..."

01:28.433 --> 01:30.134
Stimulating conversation

01:30.134 --> 01:31.901
under intricate ice sculptures...

01:31.901 --> 01:33.234
Will, I've already told you,

01:33.234 --> 01:35.101
you can't go to the conference.

01:35.101 --> 01:36.600
Why?

01:36.600 --> 01:38.201
Some things have come up.

01:38.201 --> 01:39.834
Things? What things?

01:39.834 --> 01:41.201
Well, for starters,

01:41.201 --> 01:43.400
our sensors have picked
up a very rare abnormal

01:43.400 --> 01:44.500
in the Gulf of Mexico.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.901
And?

01:46.901 --> 01:50.300
Mutated vampyroteuthis infernalis,

01:50.300 --> 01:51.333
a vampire squid,

01:51.333 --> 01:53.201
incredibly shy.

01:53.201 --> 01:54.201
I've only ever encountered one

01:54.201 --> 01:55.268
once before,

01:55.268 --> 01:57.067
60-odd years ago in French Polynesia.

01:57.067 --> 01:59.001
Okay, so a shy vampire.

01:59.001 --> 02:00.101
There's a first.

02:00.101 --> 02:01.634
Actually, the name is misleading.

02:01.634 --> 02:04.234
They're amazingly
intelligent and very docile.

02:04.234 --> 02:05.634
It's believed that
they're called "vampire"

02:05.634 --> 02:07.234
not because of a violent predilection,

02:07.234 --> 02:09.400
but more because of
their superior intellect.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.300
You know, this is fascinating,
it really is, but...

02:11.300 --> 02:12.667
the beacon is coming from

02:12.667 --> 02:15.234
an abandoned oil rig
off the Louisiana coast.

02:15.234 --> 02:16.567
Okay, so one of our retrieval teams

02:16.567 --> 02:17.801
Will pick it up, bring it back, boom.

02:17.801 --> 02:20.300
They're all in mission mode right now.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.034
I'd rather not interrupt them

02:22.034 --> 02:23.234
for something as simple as this.

02:23.234 --> 02:24.567
We Will charter a
helicopter in New Orleans

02:24.567 --> 02:26.268
and fly out there.

02:26.268 --> 02:27.467
Hey, take Kate.

02:27.467 --> 02:29.168
Kate can't dive. I need you.

02:32.134 --> 02:35.067
Okay, okay, so...

02:35.067 --> 02:36.268
I'll miss the opening reception,

02:36.268 --> 02:37.667
but I'll still be there
to give my presentation.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.001
Fine, I'll go.

02:39.001 --> 02:39.700
Actually, no.

02:41.201 --> 02:43.101
I need you here for the next few days.

02:43.101 --> 02:44.201
Why?

02:45.634 --> 02:47.001
I have a meeting in Berlin

02:47.001 --> 02:49.333
with my un security council liaison.

02:49.333 --> 02:50.934
Very time sensitive.

02:50.934 --> 02:51.867
Henry.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.101
He's in Tasmania surfing.

02:53.101 --> 02:54.101
The big guy?

02:54.101 --> 02:54.667
Is with him.

02:54.667 --> 02:55.367
Kate.

02:55.367 --> 02:56.667
Is not ready

02:56.667 --> 02:58.134
for an extended period
of being in charge.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.700
No, no, no, no, no,

02:59.700 --> 03:02.201
because I told you about
this trip months ago, okay?

03:02.201 --> 03:03.534
I'm a guest speaker.

03:03.534 --> 03:04.500
They're giving me a nice hotel room.

03:04.500 --> 03:05.567
I'm touring fjords.

03:05.567 --> 03:06.600
There's always next year.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.101
Which is next year.

03:09.101 --> 03:12.667
I'm sorry, Will. This is not a request.

03:33.134 --> 03:34.667
Magnus!

03:34.667 --> 03:39.333
Magnus! Magnus!

03:43.767 --> 03:46.600
Will? Will!

03:46.600 --> 03:47.700
Hey...

03:52.367 --> 03:54.467
Hey...

03:54.467 --> 03:56.168
You all right?

03:56.168 --> 03:58.567
I don't know.

03:58.567 --> 04:01.600
My door kind of gave way when
we, uh, you know, stopped.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.634
What about you?

04:05.634 --> 04:06.934
Well, you know,

04:06.934 --> 04:08.767
any landing you can swim away from...

04:10.400 --> 04:12.333
What is it with you and flying, anyway?

04:12.333 --> 04:15.667
Two crashes in 158
years, that's not bad.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.201
They only invented flying

04:17.201 --> 04:20.168
110 years ago, so...

04:23.134 --> 04:25.067
Oh, great.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.168
We lost our air tanks

04:26.168 --> 04:29.201
and half our scuba gear.

04:31.201 --> 04:32.067
And our friend as well.

04:34.433 --> 04:36.400
You think it's still around here?

04:36.400 --> 04:38.700
I'm sure it's long gone.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.400
This bore well leads to open water.

04:46.234 --> 04:48.400
Well, another rare abnormal stays rare.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.534
Dammit, and we had him.

05:21.433 --> 05:23.067
I've never seen something so big

05:23.067 --> 05:27.168
fit into such a small container.

05:27.168 --> 05:28.567
Cephalopod.

05:28.567 --> 05:32.400
Thankfully, a very passive one at that.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.400
This one doesn't seem too pleased

05:34.400 --> 05:35.734
that we captured it.

05:35.734 --> 05:37.500
It's much safer with us, believe me.

05:38.767 --> 05:40.500
These creatures are so passive,

05:40.500 --> 05:42.300
they're often killed by other species

05:42.300 --> 05:43.767
very early in their life cycle.

05:43.767 --> 05:46.300
Yeah, well,

05:46.300 --> 05:48.168
welcome to your new home...

05:48.168 --> 05:49.234
Squidly.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.801
We Will not be calling it that.

05:53.801 --> 05:55.168
Well, there are far more
inappropriate nicknames

05:55.168 --> 05:56.201
I could give it.

05:56.201 --> 05:57.567
I'm sure there are.

05:57.567 --> 05:58.534
Good, there's still time.

05:58.534 --> 06:03.268
For what?

06:03.268 --> 06:04.567
Connecting through Halifax,

06:04.567 --> 06:06.634
landing in the lovely city of Reykjavik,

06:06.634 --> 06:09.600
the capital of Iceland.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.134
Oh, come on, Magnus.

06:11.134 --> 06:13.500
I mean, I know Kate is
not your first choice,

06:13.500 --> 06:15.333
but can't she just hold the fort down

06:15.333 --> 06:16.567
for a couple days?

06:16.567 --> 06:17.801
I mean, I'm not going
to be gone that long.

06:17.801 --> 06:19.834
I'm sure she can, Will.

06:19.834 --> 06:22.901
Ah, see, that's the
Magnus I know and love.

06:22.901 --> 06:24.667
But the answer is still no.

06:24.667 --> 06:28.500
Prep it for flight, please.

06:36.634 --> 06:38.867
Mayday, mayday!

06:38.867 --> 06:41.168
Mayday...

06:43.333 --> 06:45.367
the radio's broken

06:45.367 --> 06:46.634
or there's far too much
concrete and steel in here

06:46.634 --> 06:48.433
for us to get a transmission out.

06:48.433 --> 06:49.767
Meaning nobody can pick up

06:49.767 --> 06:51.333
the chopper's transponder
signal, either.

07:02.634 --> 07:04.801
How deep do you think this goes?

07:06.500 --> 07:07.600
70 feet, maybe more.

07:08.567 --> 07:09.834
Without scuba gear...

07:09.834 --> 07:12.834
it's much too far for us to
try to dive to the bottom.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.700
Okay, here's what I think.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.467
Once we don't check in for a while,

07:19.467 --> 07:21.500
those lovely people we
rented the chopper from

07:21.500 --> 07:23.001
Will come looking for us, right?

07:23.001 --> 07:24.834
I mean, isn't that how
it's supposed to work?

07:24.834 --> 07:26.500
And if they follow the bogus flight plan

07:26.500 --> 07:28.333
that I filed,

07:28.333 --> 07:30.700
they'll be loooing for
us 200 Miles west of here.

07:33.268 --> 07:35.801
It's how we keep our work private, Will.

07:39.901 --> 07:41.268
Okay.

07:41.268 --> 07:43.934
Well, then, according
to the mission plan,

07:43.934 --> 07:45.667
we're due back tomorrow night.

07:45.667 --> 07:48.567
Once we don't show up,
Kate's got to get suspicious,

07:48.567 --> 07:49.867
she'll just probably...

07:51.333 --> 07:54.634
Right, right, you're right.

07:54.634 --> 07:55.967
We're totally screwed.

08:11.734 --> 08:13.367
I'm sorry about your trip to greenland.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.934
Iceland.

08:14.934 --> 08:16.801
It's... it's Iceland.

08:16.801 --> 08:18.867
I'm sorry your trip to
Iceland was scuttled,

08:18.867 --> 08:20.734
but obviously we have

08:20.734 --> 08:22.767
a far more important
problem on our hands.

08:23.867 --> 08:25.801
Yeah...

08:25.801 --> 08:27.534
We always do.

08:28.867 --> 08:29.934
What's that supposed to mean?

08:29.934 --> 08:31.801
What does it mean?

08:31.801 --> 08:32.933
It means whatever you want it to...

08:43.332 --> 08:45.867
whoa.

08:45.867 --> 08:47.834
It's all right.

08:47.834 --> 08:49.001
It just shifted position.

08:49.001 --> 08:51.600
You think it'll hold?

08:51.600 --> 08:52.801
If the crash didn't bring it down,

08:52.801 --> 08:53.901
I doubt we can.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.333
All I know is

08:56.333 --> 08:58.567
the deposit you gave
the rental company's

08:58.567 --> 08:59.700
history.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.600
You know, Magnus,

09:03.600 --> 09:04.901
maybe everything you
heard about this creature

09:04.901 --> 09:06.168
is wrong.

09:06.168 --> 09:09.300
Maybe they're not as
docile as you think.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.300
Nonsense.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.567
We captured it easily enough.

09:12.567 --> 09:14.500
It offered no resistance.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.867
Yeah, well, something freaked it out.

09:16.867 --> 09:18.634
Flying,

09:18.634 --> 09:20.367
or the vibrations from the rotors,

09:20.367 --> 09:21.500
different altitude.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.767
No.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.333
Its container was specially designed

09:24.333 --> 09:25.567
to mimic its preferred atmosphere.

09:25.567 --> 09:27.634
It should have been fine.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.534
Well, how did it go

09:29.534 --> 09:31.634
from happy-go-lucky
cephalopod

09:31.634 --> 09:33.367
to air-rage squid

09:33.367 --> 09:34.367
in a matter of a minute?

09:34.367 --> 09:37.034
I don't know.

09:48.101 --> 09:50.400
You know, I should be learning
icelandic phrases right now

09:50.400 --> 09:52.700
and discussing psychoanalytic theory

09:52.700 --> 09:54.534
over cocktails.

09:54.534 --> 09:59.034
Yes, instead, you're stuck here with me.

09:59.034 --> 10:00.567
You know what I mean.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.600
Actually, I do.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.767
This isn't about conferences

10:03.767 --> 10:05.934
or ice sculptures.

10:05.934 --> 10:07.667
It's about some immature tryst

10:07.667 --> 10:08.867
with a woman you barely know.

10:08.867 --> 10:10.067
Excuse me?

10:10.067 --> 10:12.367
Dr. Halstrom,

10:12.367 --> 10:13.433
or should I say Sigrid,

10:13.433 --> 10:14.534
your internet chat friend?

10:14.534 --> 10:16.134
Internet chat friend?

10:16.134 --> 10:18.034
She happens to be the foremost authority

10:18.034 --> 10:19.567
on deviant psychology in scandinavia,

10:19.567 --> 10:21.433
thank you very much.

10:21.433 --> 10:22.700
Such an attractive element in a woman...

10:22.700 --> 10:24.600
she has a phd!

10:24.600 --> 10:25.667
Really, Will, it's about priorities.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.367
My priorities?

10:27.367 --> 10:28.667
What is this, an
employee training seminar?

10:28.667 --> 10:30.067
Why did you want me to stay, anyways,

10:30.067 --> 10:31.367
other than to ruin my fun?

10:31.367 --> 10:32.634
Do not pretend

10:32.634 --> 10:33.967
that this is some
giant intellectual loss.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.500
This is about your libido.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.767
Come on. If you think that
this is all about me chasing...

10:38.767 --> 10:39.767
do not get self-righteous with me...

10:39.767 --> 10:41.500
whoa, hold on.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.500
What?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.067
Something just swam past my leg.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.433
What?

10:46.433 --> 10:49.600
Well, maybe that unhappy vampire squid

10:49.600 --> 10:50.901
that we have in here with us.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.567
It's Miles away by now.

10:52.567 --> 10:55.201
No, I'm telling you...

10:55.201 --> 10:57.967
Something is in here with us.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.667
Something just swam past my leg,

10:59.667 --> 11:01.634
and it's slimy...

11:45.534 --> 11:46.801
you all right?

11:46.801 --> 11:49.300
Oh, I'm Miles away from all right.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.767
You said it would break for open water.

11:50.767 --> 11:52.600
Well, it should have.

11:54.467 --> 11:55.434
Then why is it still here?

11:55.434 --> 11:57.767
I don't know.

11:57.767 --> 11:59.467
And why does it hate me so much?

11:59.467 --> 12:00.901
It might have marked this

12:00.901 --> 12:02.567
as its territory.

12:02.567 --> 12:05.567
Oh, that's wonderful news.

12:05.567 --> 12:06.934
I've never seen such aggressive behavior

12:06.934 --> 12:08.534
in this species.

12:08.534 --> 12:09.834
Come on.

12:09.834 --> 12:10.600
You might want to get out of the water.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.667
Good idea.

12:22.834 --> 12:24.967
I'm going to fry you up...

12:24.967 --> 12:28.567
A little tartar sauce...

12:33.867 --> 12:36.801
I think those tentacles gave me a rash.

12:38.034 --> 12:41.434
I've got an idea.

12:41.434 --> 12:43.068
Why don't we just shoot it?

12:43.068 --> 12:44.967
I'd prefer not to. It's a very...

12:44.967 --> 12:46.534
rare species of abnormal.

12:46.534 --> 12:47.567
Right.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.534
What we need to do

12:51.534 --> 12:53.068
is send it a clear message,

12:53.068 --> 12:55.801
at least until we figure out
why it's behaving this way.

13:06.801 --> 13:08.901
Whoa, incoming!

13:38.001 --> 13:39.701
It's really pissed now.

13:39.701 --> 13:41.101
Do not touch the water!

13:50.701 --> 13:52.734
Okay, do it!

13:52.734 --> 13:54.101
Clear!

14:04.901 --> 14:06.101
You okay?

14:06.101 --> 14:08.434
Yeah.

14:09.801 --> 14:11.600
Well, that seemed to have worked.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.001
For now.

14:13.001 --> 14:14.901
It'll be back, and...

14:14.901 --> 14:16.734
The battery's pretty much dead.

14:29.867 --> 14:30.901
Hey, uh...

14:30.901 --> 14:34.434
Thanks for, uh...

14:34.434 --> 14:36.168
Of course.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.134
So what now?

14:42.134 --> 14:43.767
Well, we can't send an sos.

14:43.767 --> 14:46.200
Eventually someone
will notice us missing

14:46.200 --> 14:46.934
and start a search.

14:46.934 --> 14:48.600
In the meantime,

14:48.600 --> 14:50.834
I want to know what turned
this creature violent...

14:50.834 --> 14:52.667
Come on, we should change.

14:52.667 --> 14:55.500
Otherwise, we'll freeze to death.

15:02.034 --> 15:04.101
I'll change somewhere else.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.068
Maybe, uh...

15:20.068 --> 15:21.901
maybe it's environmental.

15:21.901 --> 15:25.300
You know, something from the
rig is poisoning its food supply.

15:25.300 --> 15:29.001
No, scans didn't indicate
any sea water anomalies.

15:29.001 --> 15:30.134
Okay, fine,

15:30.134 --> 15:31.500
then it's just a crazy giant squid.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.767
Honestly, Will,

15:32.767 --> 15:34.134
they are one of the
most docile creatures

15:34.134 --> 15:35.267
in the entire ocean.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.967
You got to stop using
that word to describe it,

15:36.967 --> 15:38.634
'cause it is not docile.

15:38.634 --> 15:41.934
It feeds on plankton,
it lives in coral caves,

15:41.934 --> 15:44.101
it can create

15:44.101 --> 15:45.534
entire mandelbrot mathematical patterns

15:45.534 --> 15:46.867
on the floor of the ocean.

15:46.867 --> 15:48.667
I have never known one to
attack another life form.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.101
Really?

15:50.101 --> 15:51.534
Well, what about
bringing down a chopper?

15:51.534 --> 15:53.801
'Cause this one did.

15:55.167 --> 15:58.034
Delegates from around the
world are going to be there!

15:59.633 --> 16:01.301
Plus, there's an
intense discussion group

16:01.301 --> 16:03.468
on amygdaline mutation!

16:03.468 --> 16:06.334
I think it would
really benefit our work!

16:06.334 --> 16:08.334
Would you tie off the
other side, please?

16:08.334 --> 16:09.733
Yeah!

16:11.067 --> 16:12.401
Anyway, I think my being there

16:12.401 --> 16:14.234
would expand my knowledge

16:14.234 --> 16:17.568
of cutting-edge psychological theory!

16:17.568 --> 16:18.967
The cross-over in treating abnormals

16:18.967 --> 16:20.367
would be endless!

16:20.367 --> 16:22.367
Uh, Will, could you
sit in the back, please?

16:22.367 --> 16:25.134
Just in case it needs sedation!

16:25.134 --> 16:27.334
Really? It...

16:27.334 --> 16:28.667
It seems fine.

16:28.667 --> 16:30.167
Better safe than sorry!

16:30.167 --> 16:34.700
Sea creatures rarely like flying!

16:34.700 --> 16:36.367
All right.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.201
All set?

16:51.201 --> 16:52.700
Let's go.

17:01.234 --> 17:03.167
Whoa!

17:03.167 --> 17:04.401
Hey!

17:13.067 --> 17:14.434
Fuselage is intact.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.101
What the hell made us crash?

17:16.101 --> 17:17.599
I remember a loud noise

17:17.599 --> 17:20.101
and then the squidapus went insane,

17:20.101 --> 17:23.134
so maybe it just really
didn't like flying.

17:23.134 --> 17:24.334
Possibly,

17:24.334 --> 17:25.568
though why it's still upset

17:25.568 --> 17:27.067
is anyone's guess.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.234
Antenna's broken.

17:37.234 --> 17:39.434
Means the radio is definitely out.

17:46.767 --> 17:49.667
Hey...

17:49.667 --> 17:52.468
I should have come clean
to you about sigrid.

17:52.468 --> 17:54.434
I'm sorry.

17:54.434 --> 17:56.134
What you do in your own time

17:56.134 --> 17:57.767
is your own business,

17:57.767 --> 17:59.434
just so long as it
doesn't affect our work.

17:59.434 --> 18:01.600
Granted, but...

18:01.600 --> 18:05.234
What's wrong with
taking a little time off?

18:05.234 --> 18:08.134
Things have been pretty
hectic around here.

18:08.134 --> 18:10.334
What's your point, Will?

18:14.834 --> 18:17.367
Well, don't you ever
want to take a break?

18:17.367 --> 18:19.534
Not really.

18:23.301 --> 18:24.834
Stranded.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.334
Well, we've got some flares.

18:31.334 --> 18:33.733
We could wait till night,

18:33.733 --> 18:34.568
fire them off.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.267
Flares only work

18:37.267 --> 18:39.501
if there's someone in
the vicinity to see them.

18:39.501 --> 18:42.367
This rig is Miles from
the nearest shipping lanes.

18:42.367 --> 18:45.700
Okay, well, you must have
been stranded at Sea before.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.700
Only once.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.667
April 14th, 1912.

18:51.234 --> 18:52.434
Really?

19:01.134 --> 19:02.134
I wonder

19:02.134 --> 19:03.267
how they serviced the drill apparatus

19:03.267 --> 19:05.834
when it was in here.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.568
I mean, do you see right up there,

19:07.568 --> 19:09.501
right up by the lights?

19:10.867 --> 19:12.101
I bet you those air vents

19:12.101 --> 19:14.167
double as maintenance portals.

19:14.167 --> 19:16.367
And the pattern continues down below.

19:16.367 --> 19:18.334
Yeah.

19:18.334 --> 19:19.600
How far do you think down that is?

19:19.600 --> 19:21.867
30, 40 feet?

19:21.867 --> 19:23.867
That's doable as a free dive, right?

19:23.867 --> 19:25.234
Yeah.

19:25.234 --> 19:27.401
Okay.

19:27.401 --> 19:28.700
So, we take the transponder

19:28.700 --> 19:29.800
from the helicopter,

19:29.800 --> 19:31.600
we swim down to the portal,

19:31.600 --> 19:33.234
out to the surface,

19:33.234 --> 19:35.167
and signal for help.

19:36.501 --> 19:37.700
Unless, of course,

19:37.700 --> 19:40.600
the docile squid attacks us before then.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.134
Well, if it attacks both of us,

19:43.134 --> 19:44.367
we don't stand a chance,

19:44.367 --> 19:47.633
but if one of us were to stay here...

19:47.633 --> 19:49.834
What, like as a distraction?

19:49.834 --> 19:51.767
It seems to hate you more.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.534
Yeah, it really does, doesn't it?

20:02.234 --> 20:03.900
All right?

20:03.900 --> 20:05.367
Hold on a second.

20:05.367 --> 20:07.201
All right.

20:07.201 --> 20:08.301
You're good to go.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.733
All right, if I make it out...

20:13.733 --> 20:15.700
Throw me down a sandwich.

20:15.700 --> 20:16.800
And an uzi.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.834
Hey...

20:18.834 --> 20:20.900
Are you sure you're all right?

20:20.900 --> 20:23.301
Yeah.

22:17.034 --> 22:18.534
Come on.

22:37.834 --> 22:40.834
Okay, so when you say priorities...

22:40.834 --> 22:42.267
Does that include drowning?

22:45.367 --> 22:46.334
Thank you.

22:46.334 --> 22:47.834
Don't thank me.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.501
The system purged itself.

22:49.501 --> 22:52.101
You got lucky.

23:08.334 --> 23:10.101
Of course!

23:10.101 --> 23:11.633
What?

23:11.633 --> 23:15.267
Why didn't I think of this earlier?

23:15.267 --> 23:19.034
If we can salvage enough wiring,

23:19.034 --> 23:20.301
we run an extension

23:20.301 --> 23:21.934
from the radio's internal antenna...

23:21.934 --> 23:22.967
right to the wall.

23:22.967 --> 23:24.367
Yeah.

23:24.367 --> 23:27.334
We can use the entire
rig to boost the signal.

23:27.334 --> 23:30.334
But isn't the battery almost dead?

23:30.334 --> 23:33.934
We should be able to get
one last transmission out.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.334
All right.

23:35.334 --> 23:38.101
Bring on the hail Mary.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.034
What?

23:41.034 --> 23:43.301
It's Worth a shot.

23:53.334 --> 23:55.134
All right...

23:55.134 --> 23:57.434
Start with the avionic wiring.

23:57.434 --> 23:59.000
We definitely don't need that anymore.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.600
All right.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.934
Rip as much wire as you can.

24:02.934 --> 24:07.101
Start splicing.

24:22.468 --> 24:24.234
So you never go on vacation, huh?

24:24.234 --> 24:25.568
I travel all the time. You know that.

24:25.568 --> 24:28.301
Yeah, on missions or for research.

24:28.301 --> 24:29.900
I'm talking about, you know,

24:29.900 --> 24:33.134
flopping down on a
beach with a good book,

24:33.134 --> 24:37.067
a never-ending supply of mojitos.

24:37.067 --> 24:39.000
I own a villa in Italy,

24:39.000 --> 24:40.534
on Capri, near naples.

24:40.534 --> 24:42.034
I go there every seven years.

24:42.034 --> 24:43.934
Seven years?

24:43.934 --> 24:46.367
Yeah, for a long weekend.

24:46.367 --> 24:48.967
Wow, I take it back.

24:48.967 --> 24:51.534
You really do know how to unwind.

24:51.534 --> 24:53.633
That's about as long as
I can stand doing nothing.

24:53.633 --> 24:55.501
British, remember?

24:55.501 --> 24:58.600
Wait a second. Let me get this straight.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.034
You own a villa in Italy, and
you never told me about it?

25:01.034 --> 25:04.468
I own a lot of things
you don't know about.

25:04.468 --> 25:06.234
Really?

25:06.234 --> 25:08.267
What about a working helicopter?

25:08.267 --> 25:12.234
Yeah, several.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.034
She's nice, you know.

25:17.034 --> 25:18.267
Sigrid.

25:18.267 --> 25:21.234
She's friendly and charming.

25:21.234 --> 25:23.501
She's chair of advanced psychology

25:23.501 --> 25:24.600
at Stockholm university.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.000
She sounds lovely.

25:29.201 --> 25:32.034
You know, ever since Clarr,
things have been kind of...

25:32.034 --> 25:33.234
lonely.

25:33.234 --> 25:34.667
Yeah.

25:34.667 --> 25:38.234
Well, goes with the
territory, I'm afraid.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.700
Yeah, but doesn't it make us all

25:42.700 --> 25:44.468
more productive

25:44.468 --> 25:46.434
if we have, you know, normal,

25:46.434 --> 25:48.700
healthy relationships?

25:48.700 --> 25:50.401
You're not being serious, are you?

25:50.401 --> 25:52.134
What am I talking about?

25:52.134 --> 25:53.800
Nothing we do is normal.

25:55.367 --> 25:58.067
I don't think the bout
of occasional loneliness

25:58.067 --> 26:00.667
is too High a Price
to pay for what we do.

26:00.667 --> 26:02.000
Maybe you do.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.534
You just should have told me about it

26:03.534 --> 26:05.067
when you recruited me.

26:06.468 --> 26:07.600
But then you never
would have taken the job.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.667
Probably not.

26:08.667 --> 26:09.767
And you'd be miserable.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.167
So, what's your cover with sigrid,

26:14.167 --> 26:15.301
greeting card salesman?

26:15.301 --> 26:17.633
Fire insurance.

26:21.667 --> 26:22.767
Oh, God...

26:22.767 --> 26:24.700
All right, ready?

26:24.700 --> 26:27.101
Hang on a second.

26:38.568 --> 26:40.367
You think this'll work?

26:40.367 --> 26:42.234
It should do.

26:42.234 --> 26:43.501
I've never been stranded for too long.

26:45.568 --> 26:48.367
So, uh...

26:48.367 --> 26:49.568
The Titanic?

26:52.134 --> 26:54.534
I was fished out of the
water by Molly Brown.

26:54.534 --> 26:55.800
She hauled me into her life raft.

26:58.334 --> 26:59.867
I was very lucky.

27:04.101 --> 27:05.234
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

27:05.234 --> 27:07.534
This is a-star 350,

27:07.534 --> 27:10.267
n-zero-x-one-seven-j.

27:10.267 --> 27:11.468
Aircraft down.

27:11.468 --> 27:14.633
Requesting immediate assistance.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.600
We are at 27 degrees North

27:17.600 --> 27:19.633
by 89 degrees West.

27:19.633 --> 27:22.600
Two souls onboard.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.234
Mayday, mayday, mayday...

27:26.167 --> 27:27.534
Oh, come on...

27:29.501 --> 27:31.501
No.

27:31.501 --> 27:33.733
The battery's gone.

27:35.767 --> 27:38.434
You weren't kidding about the hail Mary.

27:46.201 --> 27:47.867
Do we have any food?

27:47.867 --> 27:49.501
Yeah.

27:49.501 --> 27:53.234
There's mres in my gear bag.

27:53.234 --> 27:56.234
Well, did you move it?

27:57.900 --> 28:00.301
It was right there.

28:00.301 --> 28:01.633
Maybe it got knocked into the water.

28:04.201 --> 28:05.267
You don't think it took it, do you?

28:05.267 --> 28:07.834
What, the squid?

28:07.834 --> 28:10.267
After the shock we gave
it, highly unlikely.

28:10.267 --> 28:11.667
Besides,

28:11.667 --> 28:12.900
it wouldn't be remotely interested

28:12.900 --> 28:15.934
in our emergency rations.

28:15.934 --> 28:19.800
They're kind of a
last resort for me too.

28:30.367 --> 28:32.568
What is this?

28:39.534 --> 28:41.967
Some kind of residue
the squid left behind

28:41.967 --> 28:43.301
when it attacked?

28:43.301 --> 28:45.667
Adult vampire squid
don't secrete anything

28:45.667 --> 28:46.834
remotely like this.

28:46.834 --> 28:48.501
Well, then, what the hell...

28:52.667 --> 28:53.867
quiet.

29:07.568 --> 29:08.767
Holy crap.

29:14.234 --> 29:16.733
Don't tell me it's another squid.

29:16.733 --> 29:18.367
Maybe one of its Young.

29:18.367 --> 29:20.301
It explains why it
gave us such a hard time

29:20.301 --> 29:22.267
when we tried to take off.

29:22.267 --> 29:24.834
Now, we have to be extremely careful

29:24.834 --> 29:27.667
not to hurt or frighten it.

29:35.600 --> 29:39.568
Okay, that is definitely
not a baby vampire squid!

29:55.867 --> 29:57.534
Southern hemispheric sea scorpion!

29:58.034 --> 29:59.867
Very rare,

29:59.867 --> 30:01.334
extremely dangerous!

30:01.334 --> 30:03.767
How the hell did it
get inside the chopper?

30:03.767 --> 30:07.667
I knew I wasn't that bad a pilot.

30:15.801 --> 30:17.334
Hey!

30:20.834 --> 30:22.100
I think I'm going to throw up!

30:22.100 --> 30:23.367
This is ridiculous!

30:23.367 --> 30:25.300
Hold on, I've lost lateral control!

30:28.701 --> 30:31.034
Okay, this is really not going well!

30:31.034 --> 30:33.068
Looks like it climbed onto the tail

30:33.068 --> 30:34.734
as we took off.

30:34.734 --> 30:38.100
Crawled inside the exhaust louver.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.968
It must have got trapped
in the engine compartment.

30:39.968 --> 30:41.901
That's why I lost flight control.

30:41.901 --> 30:45.200
I thought vampire squid
weren't aggressive,

30:45.200 --> 30:47.300
that other creatures killed them off?

30:47.300 --> 30:49.400
Yeah, ordinarily, they're the victim.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.133
It could be that the Sea scorpion

30:51.133 --> 30:53.334
is the one species that
triggers its fight response.

30:53.334 --> 30:56.200
Both these creatures
must have claimed the rig

30:56.200 --> 30:57.934
as their territory.

30:57.934 --> 30:59.267
They'll fight to the
death if we let them.

30:59.267 --> 31:03.200
So it's a turf war? Wonderful.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.601
It must have sensed
its adversary was nearby

31:04.601 --> 31:05.934
when we loaded it into the chopper.

31:07.867 --> 31:10.867
But see, if the scorpion
hates the squid so much,

31:10.867 --> 31:12.068
why doesn't it just jump into the water,

31:12.068 --> 31:14.133
and they can, you know, do battle?

31:14.133 --> 31:15.467
It's a bottom-dwelling
arachnid amphibian.

31:15.467 --> 31:17.767
It can't swim. The squid can.

31:17.767 --> 31:21.068
Ah, so it needs solid
ground to settle the score.

31:21.068 --> 31:23.167
They're actually very
well suited as enemies.

31:23.167 --> 31:25.001
The Sea scorpion is also

31:25.001 --> 31:26.834
more intelligent than it looks.

31:26.834 --> 31:28.334
It's just that it's incredibly vicious.

31:28.334 --> 31:30.467
It's the vicious part
that I'm worried about,

31:30.467 --> 31:32.834
not so much the smart.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.200
Whoa!

31:43.367 --> 31:44.834
It unlocked the hatch?

31:44.834 --> 31:46.801
How did it know how to unlock the hatch?

31:48.901 --> 31:50.034
I told you it was intelligent!

31:50.034 --> 31:51.467
Hold on, Will, I'm coming!

31:54.367 --> 31:55.367
Will, you have to load the harpoon!

32:03.834 --> 32:05.133
What is t about me

32:05.133 --> 32:06.334
that makes these things hate me so much?

32:06.334 --> 32:07.567
Where is it?

32:07.567 --> 32:09.167
It's gone to the other
side! I can't see it!

32:13.434 --> 32:16.001
Will, it's coming 'round this side!

32:19.934 --> 32:20.901
Magnus!

32:23.167 --> 32:26.034
Hello, beastie.

32:53.901 --> 32:55.534
Will!

33:17.068 --> 33:19.001
The other hatches are sealed.

33:19.001 --> 33:20.300
This should hold it for now.

33:40.267 --> 33:42.667
I now officially hate seafood.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.434
We have to get these two creatures

33:44.434 --> 33:46.500
as far away from us as possible.

33:46.500 --> 33:47.701
Agreed...

33:47.701 --> 33:49.467
But how?

33:51.200 --> 33:53.500
We drop the chopper.

33:54.634 --> 33:56.667
Okay.

33:56.667 --> 33:58.200
Okay, so...

33:58.200 --> 34:00.068
scorpion can't swim,

34:00.068 --> 34:01.400
the squid won't leave

34:01.400 --> 34:02.667
until it gets the scorpion.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.100
We cut the helicopter loose,

34:04.100 --> 34:05.434
squid Will follow it down.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.534
How are we going to do that?

34:07.534 --> 34:09.266
The acetylene torch from my diving Kit.

34:09.266 --> 34:11.001
It should be able to
cut through those wires.

34:11.001 --> 34:12.734
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

34:12.734 --> 34:17.400
So we're goong to use... a torch

34:17.400 --> 34:20.068
on top of a fuel-soaked chopper

34:20.068 --> 34:22.199
that has a Sea scorpion trapped inside

34:22.199 --> 34:25.934
so the giant vampire
squid will follow it down?

34:25.934 --> 34:28.667
Sounds like a plan.

34:28.667 --> 34:33.367
No beaches. No mojitos. No fancy villas.

35:01.034 --> 35:02.300
These cables

35:02.300 --> 35:03.734
are really thick.

35:03.734 --> 35:06.233
It'll take me forever to get through.

35:06.233 --> 35:08.300
Just try weakening the
major stress points.

35:08.300 --> 35:10.334
Yeah.

35:20.034 --> 35:22.534
So the un.

35:22.534 --> 35:26.167
Yeah, what about it?

35:26.167 --> 35:27.767
Well, why does the liaison

35:27.767 --> 35:29.034
want to meet with you?

35:30.400 --> 35:31.667
Uh...

35:31.667 --> 35:33.068
He wants to talk to me

35:33.068 --> 35:36.167
about how I exposed Emma
Correia as a mole in our network.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.500
In person?

35:38.500 --> 35:40.767
You averted a major security breach.

35:40.767 --> 35:42.300
Couldn't you just do a teleconference?

35:42.300 --> 35:44.334
I don't mind.

35:44.334 --> 35:46.767
Munich's lovely this time of year.

35:52.367 --> 35:54.400
You mean Berlin.

35:56.034 --> 35:57.100
Right.

35:57.100 --> 35:58.400
Yes, of course, I mean Berlin.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.400
Berlin...

36:01.534 --> 36:02.667
Because you said Munich...

36:02.667 --> 36:04.701
Yeah, both are in Germany, Will.

36:04.701 --> 36:07.367
Yeah...

36:19.167 --> 36:22.068
but isn't Munich where...

36:22.068 --> 36:23.567
Olaf lives?

36:23.567 --> 36:24.634
Who?

36:24.634 --> 36:26.834
You think I don't know about you

36:26.834 --> 36:29.734
and Olaf Von Ausburg?

36:29.734 --> 36:31.434
Super-rich guy,

36:31.434 --> 36:33.300
he owns the Bremen soccer club.

36:33.300 --> 36:35.367
I haven't seen him in decades.

36:36.601 --> 36:38.233
Okay...

36:38.233 --> 36:40.500
You look me in the eye

36:40.500 --> 36:43.300
and tell me that you were
going to meet the un liaison

36:43.300 --> 36:44.867
and not Olaf.

36:49.233 --> 36:51.334
I appreciate the offer, Olaf,

36:51.334 --> 36:53.100
but it's not a good time right now.

36:54.701 --> 36:56.167
It never is, Helen.

36:56.167 --> 36:58.500
Honestly, I don't know
why you keep asking.

36:58.500 --> 37:01.334
Because even you need some
time off once in a while,

37:01.334 --> 37:05.434
especially after everything
you've been through.

37:05.434 --> 37:07.233
Please...

37:07.233 --> 37:10.667
Let me be there for you, hmm?

37:10.667 --> 37:13.467
You need this.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.267
He offered me a weekend away.

37:18.267 --> 37:19.734
I was considering going.

37:19.734 --> 37:21.767
I knew it!

37:21.767 --> 37:23.667
It was a romantic getaway, wasn't it?

37:23.667 --> 37:25.001
It's my prerogative

37:25.001 --> 37:26.367
how I spend my personal time.

37:26.367 --> 37:28.133
Oh, but when I try to get away,

37:28.133 --> 37:29.267
I get the speech about priorities?

37:29.267 --> 37:30.801
Double standard much?

37:30.801 --> 37:31.801
I've been doing this a lot
longer than you have, Will.

37:31.801 --> 37:32.901
Which I respect,

37:32.901 --> 37:35.233
but just don't give me a hard time

37:35.233 --> 37:36.267
when I try to take care of myself.

37:36.267 --> 37:37.601
Oh, please.

37:37.601 --> 37:38.701
With sigrid?

37:38.701 --> 37:40.167
Yeah.

37:40.167 --> 37:41.167
You can do much better than that.

37:41.167 --> 37:44.200
Oh, and Olaf is some prize catch?

37:44.200 --> 37:45.734
The guy looks like a MaseratI salesman.

37:47.901 --> 37:50.701
It doesn't matter anyway. I'm not going.

37:52.701 --> 37:54.167
Why?

37:54.167 --> 37:56.233
Magnus?

37:56.233 --> 37:59.334
Far too many things going on.

38:01.267 --> 38:03.167
That clears the air.

38:03.167 --> 38:05.767
Well...

38:05.767 --> 38:08.634
I think you should have
taken him up on his offer.

38:12.534 --> 38:13.801
- Look out!
- Will, hold on!

38:22.667 --> 38:23.801
Will!

38:23.801 --> 38:24.934
Don't move!

38:37.300 --> 38:39.034
Any sudden movement, and it will strike!

38:41.133 --> 38:43.634
Okay.

38:43.634 --> 38:45.133
Will, look out!

38:45.133 --> 38:46.534
Get out of there!

39:12.968 --> 39:15.267
Ah, that's not good.

39:16.968 --> 39:18.400
The squid can't win.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.233
We have to end this, and now!

39:21.233 --> 39:23.534
Well, that thing ain't coming down

39:23.534 --> 39:24.934
any time soon,

39:24.934 --> 39:27.267
not without something
stronger to cut those cables.

39:36.233 --> 39:38.367
Stay here.

39:38.367 --> 39:39.367
Hey, where are you going?

40:15.133 --> 40:16.968
How deep can you dive?

40:16.968 --> 40:18.701
Light it up!

40:48.500 --> 40:51.334
Whoa! Wow!

40:51.334 --> 40:53.667
Wow!

40:53.667 --> 40:55.667
You just blew the whole thing!

40:55.667 --> 40:57.701
It's just... gone!

40:59.667 --> 41:01.467
You're crazy, you know that?

41:01.467 --> 41:03.200
You're absolutely certifiably insane.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.300
That was pretty cool.

41:05.300 --> 41:06.534
Cool, yeah!

41:06.534 --> 41:08.634
That was, like, James Bond,

41:08.634 --> 41:10.167
die hard cool.

41:10.167 --> 41:11.367
Better than room service

41:11.367 --> 41:12.400
in Reykjavik?

41:14.100 --> 41:16.133
Yeah, way better.

41:16.133 --> 41:18.634
Never let it be said

41:18.634 --> 41:20.567
that I don't know how to
show someone a good time.

41:20.567 --> 41:23.233
Yeah, you got it, believe me.

41:36.133 --> 41:37.500
Tuesday is Ashley's birthday.

41:41.133 --> 41:42.701
That's the real reason
I wanted you to stay.

41:42.701 --> 41:43.734
I just...

41:43.734 --> 41:45.300
I didn't know how to ask you.

41:45.300 --> 41:49.534
Oh, Magnus, i...

41:52.100 --> 41:53.500
I guess it didn't help

41:53.500 --> 41:56.567
that I was desperately
trying to get away to Iceland.

42:02.467 --> 42:04.567
It's hard, isn't it?

42:06.400 --> 42:07.767
To find someone worth a damn.

42:07.767 --> 42:09.834
You're kidding, right?

42:09.834 --> 42:13.367
I mean, there's plenty
of fish in the sea.

42:15.367 --> 42:16.734
No, no, no....

42:16.734 --> 42:18.601
No, no, no, you... you
didn't just make that joke.

42:18.601 --> 42:20.767
You didn't just make
that joke right here.

42:20.767 --> 42:21.867
You laughed.

42:21.867 --> 42:23.100
No, I didn't.

42:23.100 --> 42:25.233
I... it was derisively, out of pity.

42:25.233 --> 42:26.734
Ah, a laugh's a laugh.

42:26.734 --> 42:30.334
Yeah, no, I was just
choking on helicopter fuel.

42:41.701 --> 42:43.400
You know...

42:43.400 --> 42:45.767
we sent up a pretty good flare just now.

42:45.767 --> 42:47.434
I think so.

42:50.634 --> 42:52.601
You think anybody'll see it?

42:52.601 --> 42:54.867
I don't know.

42:54.867 --> 42:56.167
With my luck...
