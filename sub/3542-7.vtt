00:03.753 --> 00:07.256
KLAUS: Only thing stronger than the craving
for blood is your love for this girl.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.425
Turn it off.

00:09.592 --> 00:10.634
STEFAN:
No!

00:12.429 --> 00:13.637
Turn it off!

00:14.014 --> 00:16.306
- What did you do?
- I fixed him.

00:16.474 --> 00:20.269
Klaus is gone but he's asked me
to keep watch on you until he returns.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.771
From now on,
you're under my protection.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.273
It's kind of a push and pull.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.859
I'm pushing from the other side,
trying to contact you.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.695
And sometimes, like just now,
if you pull...

00:29.863 --> 00:31.697
Bonnie, stop dodging my calls.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.116
Why are you thinking about me
when calling her?

00:34.284 --> 00:35.993
I don't think I can stop.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.328
DAMON: Who's the guy with Carol?
FORBES: Mason Lockwood.

00:38.496 --> 00:41.457
DAMON: Mason Lockwood is a werewolf.
He'll kill me the first chance he got.

Hurts, doesn't it?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.703
Oh, Stefan.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.002
Low blow, Stefan.

01:27.378 --> 01:29.671
Low blow.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.757
What the hell happened to you?

01:31.925 --> 01:35.177
Whatever twisted ripper game this is...

01:35.345 --> 01:37.179
...leave me out of it.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.849
- I didn't do this.
DAMON: Quit screwing around.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.851
I didn't.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.689
- That's pretty messed up, isn't it?
- Yep.

[CROWD APPLAUDING]

02:30.859 --> 02:33.402
Tonight we turn off our town's lights
and flare up our lanterns...

02:33.570 --> 02:38.407
...in honor of the Night of Illumination
started by our founders 150 years ago.

02:38.575 --> 02:43.078
Here's founding family member
Tobias Fell with a history lesson.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.580
What are we doing here?

02:44.747 --> 02:47.791
Tobias Fell is the head
of the History Department.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.251
I didn't have a choice.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.628
All right, that explains
what you're doing here.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.256
I'm the one who can fail you
if you don't help me out.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.092
Hey, sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

02:57.260 --> 03:00.095
- Just a bunch of historical lies.
- You didn't miss anything.

03:00.263 --> 03:04.766
The first illumination was held in
celebration of the newfound prosperity...

03:04.934 --> 03:07.603
...that Mystic Falls enjoyed
after the war.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.980
After the founders stole
from all the vampires.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.107
TOBIAS:
The founders, they placed lanterns...

03:12.275 --> 03:14.860
- What's so funny?
TOBIAS: Above their doors to indicate...

03:15.028 --> 03:18.447
...that it was safe for their neighbors
to come outside again.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.283
- Safe from the vampires.
TOBIAS: That night...

03:21.451 --> 03:24.161
...was an opportunity for the community
of Mystic Falls...

03:24.329 --> 03:27.539
...to come together.
A chance to strengthen ties

03:27.707 --> 03:32.127
...with neighbors, business owners
and returning soldiers.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.631
When you did the spell to send
Vicki away, did that get rid of Anna too?

03:35.798 --> 03:40.177
I wish. All I did was block the magic that
was helping Vicki get a foothold here.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.721
Jeremy's still got a direct line
to the other side.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.140
And as long as he wants to see Anna...

03:45.308 --> 03:48.143
...and she wants to see him,
she's still here.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.854
You don't think
I can actually resist commenting on that.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.814
There. You commented.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.026
- Bonnie...
- What do you want me to say, Caroline?

03:56.194 --> 03:58.862
I went against nature
when I brought Jeremy back to life.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.740
- I'm paying the consequences.
- Say you're not okay with it.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.535
I'm a thousand times not okay with it.
I just don't know what to do about it.

04:11.542 --> 04:15.003
Greetings, blondie, witchy.

04:15.171 --> 04:18.507
You got your voodoo wires crossed
when you got rid of Vicki Donovan.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.009
- What do you mean? Why?
- Because I'm pretty sure...

04:21.177 --> 04:23.595
...I just got spit-roasted
by Mason Lockwood's ghost.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.514
- What?
- Why would you think that?

04:25.682 --> 04:29.268
Maybe because he chained me to a chair
and shoved a hot poker in my chest.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.770
Let's just say I'm having déjà vu.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.690
You said ghosts couldn't
physically interact with people.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.567
- They can't.
- I don't have time for vengeful Lockwood.

04:37.735 --> 04:40.988
When I kill someone,
they're supposed to stay dead.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.491
Whatever you screwed up, fix it.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.794
- Hey, Jer, I need you to help me.
- What's up?

04:56.004 --> 05:00.257
Been going through Stefan's journals.
Every time that he's gone off the rails...

05:00.425 --> 05:02.467
...Lexi has been the one
to bring him back.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.469
So where is she now
that we need her?

05:04.637 --> 05:05.721
She's dead.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.390
You want me to try to reach her,
don't you?

05:08.558 --> 05:11.059
If I knew how she did it,
maybe I could help him.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.395
I don't even know
if she's on the other side.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.063
Is that what it's called?

05:15.231 --> 05:18.567
That's what Anna calls it.
There's not, like, an official brochure.

05:18.735 --> 05:22.279
So, what is it, like some sort
of supernatural purgatory?

05:22.447 --> 05:26.658
Anna said it's like being here with us,
only we can't see her or hear her...

05:26.826 --> 05:28.785
...and she can't interact with anyone.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.829
And she's all alone.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.959
Vicki could interact.
She blew up my car.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.754
Vicki had help from a witch
on the other side.

05:38.921 --> 05:42.591
Anna, she's doing this all by herself.

05:43.259 --> 05:46.803
I'm just saying, maybe we learned our
lesson about summoning dead people.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.432
I haven't seen Vicki. I swear.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.101
- I sent her back like you told me to.
- Are you sure?

05:53.269 --> 05:55.812
She has as much reason
to haunt Damon as Mason does.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.815
She's gone, Bonnie.
If she was here, I'd know it.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.942
Why do you think it's Vicki
and not Mason?

06:01.110 --> 06:05.447
If any ghosts other than Vicki Donovan
has a physical foothold on our side...

06:05.865 --> 06:09.451
...then that means Damon's right
and something has gone really wrong.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.120
I've had enough of this ghost stuff
to last forever.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.289
So you guys can leave me out
of this one.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.626
I feel so sad for him.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.128
Took a lot for him
to send his sister away.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.880
Yeah.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.675
So much strength is a man.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.719
I've got a ghost problem to deal with.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.806
Save the Jeremy lecture for later.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.480
- Okay, did your Grimoire just...?
- I think so.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.322
Please tell me that's a recipe
for witch cookies.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.491
It's a manifestation spell.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.077
It's used to reveal veiled matter.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.162
What's "veiled matter"?

06:54.997 --> 06:56.123
Ghosts.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.001
Do you think it's even possible
to contact Lexi?

07:00.169 --> 07:04.005
I don't know. I didn't have
an emotional connection with her.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.174
- I never even met her.
- Could we drop it?

07:06.342 --> 07:08.218
I can't, Ric.
I don't know what else to do.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.012
Don't you think we have too many
vampires in our past...

07:11.180 --> 07:13.515
...to be sitting here,
thinking of them watching us?

07:14.183 --> 07:17.018
I don't think all supernatural spirits
go to the other side.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.356
I think some of them find peace.

07:22.733 --> 07:26.236
- Is Anna here right now?
- Don't tell her I'm here. She won't like it.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.906
No. No. I'm gonna go, uh,
check my work schedule.

07:36.914 --> 07:40.542
Hey, guys. Who forgot to invite me
to the family summit?

07:45.673 --> 07:46.798
Oh, wow.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.217
All these words.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.262
I forgot how much I used to care.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.222
I didn't.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.438
You know, Elena, it's probably best
you not torture yourself...

08:01.606 --> 08:03.106
...with memories from the past.

08:04.233 --> 08:08.195
It's best we both just move on
and accept things as they are.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.405
You don't have to be here, Stefan.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.407
You know what? You're right, I don't.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.494
But Elena's here
and I look out for Elena.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.996
There's gonna be people
everywhere tonight...

08:18.206 --> 08:20.707
...so there's gonna be lots to eat.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.926
I can't drop it, Ric.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.933
So this is where
you brought Jeremy back to life?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.519
Yeah. Sorry, I know it's creepy.

08:40.727 --> 08:44.314
But we needed a private place
around here to do the spell.

08:45.441 --> 08:48.276
There's no chance it's haunted
by the hundred dead witches...

08:48.444 --> 08:51.655
...who were horrifically burned to death
in this very spot, is there?

08:52.740 --> 08:54.115
They're not here anymore.

08:54.283 --> 08:56.701
And they made it clear
they were never coming back.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.495
Great.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.248
They pinky swear?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.172
What's wrong?

09:09.340 --> 09:11.174
Why did you tell me to lie?

09:12.134 --> 09:14.302
Elena is Bonnie's best friend.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.471
She won't like
what's going on between us.

What is going on between us?

09:18.975 --> 09:23.520

Vicki had to use magic to do that.

I don't know. Honestly, I have no idea.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.902

that gave Vicki her foothold...

09:31.070 --> 09:32.654
...is she helping you now?

09:32.822 --> 09:35.657
What? No.

- Swear to me.

there'd be consequences...
