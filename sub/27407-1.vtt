00:51.584 --> 00:54.088
<i>Pretty good. That's good.</i>

00:55.726 --> 00:56.993
<i>Try it again. Whap!</i>

00:56.995 --> 00:58.261
<i>Make sure your fingers
are in the right..</i>

00:58.263 --> 01:00.502
<i>That's not bad. Okay.</i>

01:03.106 --> 01:04.510
Ready? Go!

01:06.480 --> 01:10.151
- You got it.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, over here.

01:14.931 --> 01:17.267
Oh, oh, I got it!

01:28.757 --> 01:30.026
Oh!

01:33.934 --> 01:35.167
Come here.

01:35.169 --> 01:37.407
<i>Joe, napkin's in that box
behind you.</i>

01:38.911 --> 01:41.212
So did you have fun at practice?

01:41.214 --> 01:42.782
Yeah, it was okay.

01:42.784 --> 01:45.287
There's no law that says
you have to play football.

01:45.289 --> 01:46.690
He'll be fine.
He's just gotta show 'em

01:46.692 --> 01:47.859
what he's worth, that's all.

01:47.861 --> 01:49.396
Hon, where's the carving knife?
Is it..

01:49.398 --> 01:51.800
Uh, it's just
on the counter there.

01:51.802 --> 01:53.337
I'll just go and grab it.

01:53.339 --> 01:54.873
Oh, guess what.

01:54.875 --> 01:56.009
We're using
the same math textbook

01:56.011 --> 01:57.712
that I had in Lewiston
last year.

01:57.714 --> 01:59.115
Already done it all.

01:59.117 --> 02:01.284
Well, they should put you
in a more advanced class then.

02:01.286 --> 02:02.522
Do you want me to call them?

02:02.524 --> 02:04.993
Oh, no harm
in letting the boy get ahead.

02:04.995 --> 02:06.529
This way, he'll be the front
of his class.

02:06.531 --> 02:09.101
He could be the front
of his class, anyway.

02:09.103 --> 02:11.574
You'll tell the teacher
if it gets too easy. Right, Joe?

02:12.643 --> 02:14.246
Yeah. Okay.

02:16.818 --> 02:19.488
Do we need a comma here?

02:19.490 --> 02:22.494
- Yeah. Here. I've got it.
- Okay.

02:31.648 --> 02:33.683
<i>That's a full count.</i>

02:33.685 --> 02:35.152
<i>Jerry?</i>

02:35.154 --> 02:36.856
- Yeah?
- <i>Can you help me?</i>

02:36.858 --> 02:38.027
Mm-hm.

02:40.698 --> 02:43.335
<i>Rusty needs to be careful.</i>

02:43.337 --> 02:44.404
<i>He winds the pitch.</i>

02:46.677 --> 02:49.981
<i>That's in there. Strike three.</i>

02:51.252 --> 02:52.620
No!

02:53.724 --> 02:56.330
<i>1960 has been a heck of a year.</i>

03:06.549 --> 03:09.186
<i>Now fire can be
a positive force.</i>

03:09.188 --> 03:10.321
<i>Clears the undergrowth</i>

03:10.323 --> 03:12.492
and helps the forest regenerate.

03:12.494 --> 03:15.064
You'll make a home
out of that timber someday.

03:15.066 --> 03:17.969
But these fires
are burnin' out of control.

03:17.971 --> 03:20.575
The fire started
about 60 miles west of us.

03:20.577 --> 03:22.546
<i>That wind is carryin'
the smoke over the plains</i>

03:22.548 --> 03:24.783
<i>and dumpin' it right here
in our valley.</i>

03:24.785 --> 03:26.954
<i>And that's a real danger.</i>

03:26.956 --> 03:29.660
<i>Scar your lungs
without you knowin' it.</i>

03:29.662 --> 03:32.331
<i>You know, nine out of ten fires
are preventable..</i>

03:32.333 --> 03:34.235
You don't have to take notes.

03:34.237 --> 03:35.370
Sorry?

03:35.372 --> 03:36.841
It's the same
as the bomb drills.

03:36.843 --> 03:38.847
If the fire ever gets to us,
it will be too late.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.520
<i>Now does anyone
have any questions?</i>

03:45.125 --> 03:46.426
My old partners can't believe

03:46.428 --> 03:47.695
the luck we've been
having up here.

03:47.697 --> 03:49.832
<i>Luck's not luck
when you plan for it.</i>

03:49.834 --> 03:51.001
<i>Signs all pointed north</i>

03:51.003 --> 03:52.471
<i>those boys were scared
to take a risk</i>

03:52.473 --> 03:53.573
<i>and didn't move fast enough.</i>

03:53.575 --> 03:54.709
<i>In a moment.</i>

03:54.711 --> 03:56.245
- <i>Leg's acting up.</i>
- Alright.

03:56.247 --> 03:57.581
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

03:57.583 --> 03:59.017
<i>Hope Jerry's treating you well.</i>

03:59.019 --> 04:00.219
Oh, he's a good one.

04:00.221 --> 04:01.723
I went ahead
and booked a lesson for tomorrow

04:01.725 --> 04:03.360
after he damn near fleeced
the pants off of me.

04:03.362 --> 04:04.829
Oh, no, no, you gentlemen

04:04.831 --> 04:07.334
were just buttering me up
for next time.

04:07.336 --> 04:09.537
You're not supposed to wager
with our guests, Jerry.

04:11.443 --> 04:14.082
Well, don't worry about it.
It was all in fun.

04:16.921 --> 04:18.154
Well, gentlemen,
you can follow me

04:18.156 --> 04:19.291
if you'd like another beer
on the house.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.593
<i>I'll take one, Clarence.</i>

04:21.764 --> 04:22.897
Oh!

04:22.899 --> 04:24.337
Thanks, Jerry.

04:28.678 --> 04:31.782
See you tomorrow,
Mr. Cartwright.

04:31.784 --> 04:34.854
I thought my husband
had already paid for everything.

04:34.856 --> 04:37.661
- <i>It seems the check bounced.</i>
- Oh.

04:38.998 --> 04:41.435
I... I'm so sorry.

04:41.437 --> 04:44.573
We, um, we had to switch banks
when we moved.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.512
That must be the problem.

04:49.885 --> 04:51.587
Must be nice

04:51.589 --> 04:53.791
being around young people
all day.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.662
All that spirit.

04:55.664 --> 04:56.764
I guess.

04:56.766 --> 04:59.370
It can tire a person out.

04:59.372 --> 05:01.974
Oh, I know.
I worked as a substitute.

05:01.976 --> 05:03.878
The last place we lived,
the teacher had a baby

05:03.880 --> 05:05.851
and I ended up staying all year.

05:07.587 --> 05:11.494
I believe we've made our hires
for the fall.

05:11.496 --> 05:13.830
No, I wasn't..

05:13.832 --> 05:15.267
Um..

05:15.269 --> 05:17.705
No, my... my... my husband
and I decided

05:17.707 --> 05:19.410
I should be home
with our son now.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.800
Brinson, ball!

05:31.802 --> 05:32.870
Come on.

05:34.606 --> 05:36.843
You grab that. Bring it in!

05:36.845 --> 05:38.245
Alright, the offense
is getting through.

05:38.247 --> 05:39.247
You gotta stop that.

05:39.249 --> 05:40.490
You can't have that
in the game.

05:45.563 --> 05:47.230
At school, they told us
to be careful outside

05:47.232 --> 05:49.169
because of all the smoke.

05:50.003 --> 05:52.206
Do you see any smoke?

05:52.208 --> 05:54.813
They are making people afraid
for no reason.

05:58.489 --> 05:59.621
How's football going?

05:59.623 --> 06:01.825
You're gonna be the next
Bob Waterfield?

06:01.827 --> 06:04.531
I don't know.

06:04.533 --> 06:07.736
Oh, that's alright. I'm not gonna
be the next Walter Hagen either.

06:07.738 --> 06:09.374
Oh, I bet you could be.

06:09.376 --> 06:12.012
Nah, he could miss a shot
and still win the hole.

06:12.014 --> 06:14.150
The game came naturally to him.

06:14.152 --> 06:16.156
But wasn't it the same for you?

06:17.892 --> 06:19.829
I thought it was that easy.

06:21.467 --> 06:23.404
<i>There's probably
something wrong in that.</i>

06:26.376 --> 06:27.646
Dad, I..

06:29.080 --> 06:31.786
I'm not... I'm not really sure
that I like football.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.366
Are you making friends
on the team?

06:39.368 --> 06:41.306
They already know each other.

06:41.973 --> 06:44.175
I know.

06:44.177 --> 06:46.447
Ask 'em personal questions.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.616
Works like a charm.

06:47.618 --> 06:49.589
People love to talk
about themselves.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.394
<i>Jerry, you got everything done?</i>

06:53.396 --> 06:54.731
Nearly.

06:58.137 --> 06:59.806
<i>Clarence, this is my son,
Joe Brinson.</i>

06:59.808 --> 07:01.677
Joe, this is Clarence Snow

07:01.679 --> 07:03.782
president of the club
and the best golfer out there.

07:05.686 --> 07:06.820
Jerry, I'd like a word with you.

07:06.822 --> 07:09.525
- That's fine.
- Give us a minute, son.

07:09.527 --> 07:10.728
Oh, could it wait till tomorrow?

07:10.730 --> 07:13.101
I... I have to get him
back home for dinner.

07:14.903 --> 07:16.575
<i>This won't take long.</i>

07:19.514 --> 07:21.451
- Okay, finish up, son.
- Yeah.

08:12.685 --> 08:14.655
Count that, would you, son?

08:22.471 --> 08:23.906
Are we rich yet?

08:26.144 --> 08:28.248
It's a little over $80.

08:32.725 --> 08:34.327
Two weeks' pay.

08:38.234 --> 08:40.738
What's a man entitled to?

08:40.740 --> 08:42.510
What do you think?

08:50.224 --> 08:52.430
Did he say why he fired you?

08:57.372 --> 09:00.345
He says I overstepped my
boundaries with the customers.

09:03.083 --> 09:06.287
I'm just personal, you know.

09:06.289 --> 09:07.591
That's what
people like about me.

09:07.593 --> 09:09.728
It's an important part
of the job.

09:09.730 --> 09:12.834
- <i>No, I know.</i>
- No, I'm too well liked.

09:12.836 --> 09:14.838
That's my problem.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.108
<i>They just, they just don't
want small people like us</i>

09:17.110 --> 09:18.715
<i>to get ahead.</i>

09:21.387 --> 09:22.956
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

09:28.567 --> 09:30.672
What am I gonna
tell your mother?

09:34.612 --> 09:37.148
Did he even give a good reason?

09:37.150 --> 09:39.187
<i>Doesn't have to have a reason.</i>

09:42.595 --> 09:44.666
You must have done something
he didn't like.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.353
Well..

09:56.957 --> 09:59.093
...that man is a damn fool.

10:00.931 --> 10:04.037
How is he ever gonna find
a better man for that job?

10:05.874 --> 10:08.344
- <i>You're not angry?</i>
- No.

10:08.346 --> 10:09.781
Not at you, anyway.

10:11.051 --> 10:13.887
<i>I'll... I'll find
something better.</i>

10:13.889 --> 10:17.662
<i>You're right. This is
an opportunity in disguise.</i>

10:17.664 --> 10:19.263
<i>The phone will be ringing
off the hook</i>

10:19.265 --> 10:21.203
<i>once people hear you're free.</i>

10:22.238 --> 10:24.477
Hey! H... Hey!

10:26.047 --> 10:27.449
Enough of that.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.923
Why don't you see
if there's a game on the radio?

10:55.004 --> 10:57.108
You won't have to worry
about anything, Joe.

10:58.544 --> 11:00.614
Yeah.
No, I'm, I'm not worried.

12:05.876 --> 12:07.678
<i>Hey, I... I missed the bus.
Can you drive me?</i>

12:07.680 --> 12:10.183
<i>Uh, your father has the car.
You'll have to take your bike.</i>

12:10.185 --> 12:12.588
<i>- Did he get an interview?
- I don't know, sweetheart.</i>

12:13.792 --> 12:15.226
Joe!

12:15.228 --> 12:16.531
- Yeah?
- <i>Can you..</i>

12:18.267 --> 12:20.171
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.879
Hello?

12:25.983 --> 12:28.187
Uh, no, he isn't in right now.
Concerning what?

12:36.270 --> 12:37.373
Dad?

12:41.012 --> 12:42.515
Dad?

12:45.688 --> 12:46.957
Hey, kiddo.

12:50.196 --> 12:52.265
Shouldn't you be in school?

12:52.267 --> 12:53.835
Yeah, uh, Mom sent me
to find you.

12:53.837 --> 12:55.775
A man from the Wheatland Club
called.

12:58.279 --> 12:59.914
What do they want?

12:59.916 --> 13:02.052
<i>They said
they made a big mistake.</i>

13:02.054 --> 13:03.991
<i>They want you to come back.</i>

13:06.762 --> 13:08.264
- They do?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

13:08.266 --> 13:09.499
You have to call right away.

13:09.501 --> 13:11.639
They said there's a job
available tomorrow.

13:18.285 --> 13:20.457
I have nothing to say
to those people.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.163
What do you mean?

13:25.165 --> 13:27.103
I won't work for people
like that.

13:29.073 --> 13:31.275
- But, Dad.
- Joe, I'll..

13:31.277 --> 13:33.481
You tell your mother

13:33.483 --> 13:34.782
that I won't work
for people like that.

13:34.784 --> 13:36.921
If they call again,
I'm not interested.

13:39.761 --> 13:40.796
Go on.

13:42.233 --> 13:43.336
Okay.

13:52.052 --> 13:54.554
Did you mail the rent?

13:54.556 --> 13:56.327
<i>I will. Tomorrow.</i>

14:02.272 --> 14:04.209
You see, they're hiring
at the Valu-Mart.

14:07.048 --> 14:10.520
I didn't, I didn't come
to Montana to bag groceries.

14:10.522 --> 14:12.560
<i>No, it'd just be
to tide us over.</i>

14:14.663 --> 14:16.800
I am not doing a teenager's job.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.812
Maybe I should go back
to work then.

14:24.983 --> 14:28.056
- I'm making contacts, Jean.
- Just a part-time job.

14:29.926 --> 14:31.863
Till you get established.

14:33.032 --> 14:36.070
It would be a good way
to meet people.

14:36.072 --> 14:38.344
It's about time
I made some friends around here.

14:43.920 --> 14:44.989
Jerry?

14:48.228 --> 14:50.498
Sure. If that's what you want.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.637
Okay.

15:19.289 --> 15:20.526
Mom?

15:22.530 --> 15:24.534
Well, would you hire me?

15:25.703 --> 15:28.105
Yeah, you look nice.

15:28.107 --> 15:29.344
Thank you.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.257
Mom, is Dad, is Dad okay?

15:37.360 --> 15:38.828
Of course, he is.

15:40.163 --> 15:42.969
Then wh... why wouldn't he
take his job back?

15:45.073 --> 15:48.412
I don't know.
Maybe his pride got hurt.

15:48.414 --> 15:49.850
That happens sometimes.

15:51.954 --> 15:54.694
Right, but he's still looking
for work though.

15:55.862 --> 15:58.197
He's interviewing, isn't he?

15:58.199 --> 15:59.569
He says he is.

16:05.448 --> 16:07.385
Will we have to move again?

16:10.625 --> 16:15.266
He's been out of work before
and he always finds his way.

16:17.003 --> 16:19.543
We have to trust him.
That's all.

16:22.881 --> 16:24.820
Come on. Zip me up.

16:32.634 --> 16:34.902
- Joe.
- Hm?

16:34.904 --> 16:36.843
Get out of my bathroom.

17:00.221 --> 17:02.326
How come you don't always
take the bus?

17:03.729 --> 17:05.564
I like to ride my bike.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.067
You're not gonna be able
to do that much longer.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.238
- The weather's about to turn.
- Yeah.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.242
I'm... I'm not looking forward
to that.

17:12.243 --> 17:13.680
I am.

17:13.682 --> 17:16.653
First sign of snow, my dad gets
to come home from the fire.

17:16.655 --> 17:18.924
Oh, is your father at the fire?

17:18.925 --> 17:20.761
He's gone almost every time
it's happened

17:20.762 --> 17:23.367
and he still has eyebrows
and hair on his head too.

17:25.338 --> 17:27.907
Don't think I've ever met
a real firefighter.

17:27.910 --> 17:30.379
He's not a firefighter.
He works in construction.

17:30.381 --> 17:33.454
But times like these, they use
all the men they can get.

17:36.594 --> 17:38.462
Have you been watching
on the news?

17:38.464 --> 17:40.668
No. Our TV's been on the fritz.

17:59.672 --> 18:02.074
<i>I have been
a substitute teacher.</i>

18:02.076 --> 18:04.880
<i>I've also been
an accountant of sorts</i>

18:04.882 --> 18:06.617
<i>um, so I'm, I'm good
with numbers.</i>

18:06.619 --> 18:07.920
And I'm also very good
with children, so...

18:07.922 --> 18:10.527
<i>We have no positions.</i>

18:15.671 --> 18:17.031
Could I speak
to your manager then?

18:18.475 --> 18:20.948
His answer's the same as mine.
We're not hiring.

18:23.084 --> 18:25.621
I can answer phones.
I can type...

18:25.623 --> 18:27.024
You know,
you should try the pharmacy.

18:27.026 --> 18:28.393
I hear they're looking
for a girl.

18:28.395 --> 18:30.263
I asked over there.

18:30.265 --> 18:31.967
Um, your ad in the paper says...

18:31.969 --> 18:34.237
There is no
secretarial position.

18:34.239 --> 18:37.878
The newspaper ran an old notice.
God knows why.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.150
<i>It's giving me a real headache
today sorting that out.</i>

18:42.322 --> 18:44.659
I'm sorry.

18:44.661 --> 18:47.364
That must be frustrating
for you.

18:47.366 --> 18:49.603
Yes, it is.

19:03.431 --> 19:06.134
Do you have anything for a man?

19:06.136 --> 19:08.239
My husband's looking for work
as well.

19:09.910 --> 19:11.781
Shucks.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.926
You don't happen to know
how to swim, do you?

19:20.364 --> 19:23.401
<i>There are two mixed age groups
and one junior class</i>

19:23.403 --> 19:25.372
<i>and they'll let me teach
privately too.</i>

19:25.374 --> 19:26.874
Can you believe the luck?

19:26.876 --> 19:31.951
Imagine, people in Montana
wanna learn to swim.

19:31.953 --> 19:35.124
- Why do you think that is?
- I don't know.

19:35.126 --> 19:38.398
Maybe we're all about to get
washed away in a big flood.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.034
No.

19:40.036 --> 19:42.740
Some of us
will get washed away

19:42.742 --> 19:45.979
but some of us
will float to the top.

19:45.981 --> 19:47.883
- It's better, isn't it?
- <i>Much better.</i>

19:47.885 --> 19:50.488
A happy ending
for the right people.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.596
People who signed up
for swimming at the Y.

20:06.855 --> 20:08.323
Maybe I should get a job too.

20:08.325 --> 20:11.463
That is a fine idea.
We can all pitch in.

20:11.465 --> 20:14.434
No, you... you have school
and football. That's enough.

20:14.436 --> 20:17.040
He'll learn more at a job
than he will playing football.

20:17.042 --> 20:20.981
He, he won't learn anything
bagging groceries.

20:20.983 --> 20:22.985
Why don't we let Joe
decide for himself?

20:39.987 --> 20:41.322
Hm?

20:41.324 --> 20:43.391
<i>- Don't threaten me, Jean.
- Oh, grow up.</i>

20:43.393 --> 20:45.229
<i>Jerry, you have your feelings
hurt is all.</i>

20:45.231 --> 20:47.235
<i>You have to face facts.</i>

21:17.795 --> 21:20.834
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, kiddo.

21:23.005 --> 21:25.510
Just turning the radio.

21:26.478 --> 21:28.681
<i>...three parts divisions.</i>

21:28.683 --> 21:31.954
<i>I learn the number of men
already out on the line</i>

21:31.956 --> 21:34.427
<i>what equipment's up front</i>

21:34.429 --> 21:36.964
<i>and that more is on the way.</i>

21:36.966 --> 21:40.236
<i>The campaign fire
is just like war</i>

21:40.238 --> 21:45.348
<i>and war, as we all know,
is grim.</i>

21:45.350 --> 21:48.787
<i>Yes, our objective goes
pretty much without saying.</i>

21:48.789 --> 21:51.594
<i>Put the fire out
as quick as we can.</i>

21:53.432 --> 21:54.565
Fingers together.

21:54.567 --> 21:56.470
Fingers together. Okay.

21:56.472 --> 21:59.442
Now push the water.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.278
That's great.
So let's try it in the pool.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.384
Everybody, down.

22:08.496 --> 22:10.764
<i>- Name?
- Joe Brinson.</i>

22:10.766 --> 22:12.667
<i>- Age?
- 14.</i>

22:12.669 --> 22:15.640
- Any work experience?
- No, sir.

22:15.642 --> 22:18.678
So have you ever handled
this kind of equipment before?

22:18.680 --> 22:20.149
No, sir.

22:20.151 --> 22:23.121
But my mother says
I'm a quick study.

22:23.123 --> 22:24.893
Hm, alright.

22:26.364 --> 22:27.965
Come with me then.

22:30.237 --> 22:31.507
Watch your head.

22:32.842 --> 22:34.478
See, one of the first things
you wanna do

22:34.480 --> 22:36.714
is to check to see
if the bulb is still hot.

22:36.716 --> 22:38.486
So just use
the back of your hand.

22:38.488 --> 22:39.921
Go ahead.

22:39.923 --> 22:43.462
<i>Now don't touch it,
but, yeah, that's good.</i>

22:43.464 --> 22:45.799
<i>Now you wanna ask
the customer to take a seat.</i>

22:45.801 --> 22:47.970
<i>So go ahead.</i>

22:47.972 --> 22:50.509
<i>And if it's a group,
you might have them stand up</i>

22:50.511 --> 22:52.346
<i>and, uh, you know,
tall people in the back</i>

22:52.348 --> 22:54.284
<i>short people in the front.</i>

22:57.558 --> 22:58.826
And then..

23:01.566 --> 23:02.866
...you know, warn the customer
you're going to turn

23:02.868 --> 23:04.970
on a bright light.

23:04.972 --> 23:07.545
And always remember to smile.

23:08.913 --> 23:11.485
That is great.
Now swim towards me.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.521
You're doing fantastic.

23:13.523 --> 23:15.693
I wanna see
both of your legs kicking.

23:25.846 --> 23:27.748
<i>We are a powerful country</i>

23:27.750 --> 23:31.154
<i>but I believe we can be
a more powerful country.</i>

23:31.156 --> 23:33.760
<i>Now in 1960,
in these dangerous</i>

23:33.762 --> 23:36.433
<i>and difficult
and challenging times</i>

23:36.435 --> 23:39.340
<i>I believe we can get
this country moving again.</i>

23:58.978 --> 24:00.813
<i>You see</i>

24:00.815 --> 24:03.653
<i>people like to come in here
to remember something good</i>

24:03.655 --> 24:05.592
<i>that's happening
in their lives.</i>

24:07.362 --> 24:09.467
<i>They wanna make
that happy moment permanent.</i>

24:10.868 --> 24:12.839
<i>That way,
they can keep it forever.</i>

24:14.008 --> 24:16.012
<i>And we're here
to help 'em do that.</i>

24:19.051 --> 24:21.155
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

24:22.224 --> 24:23.494
Good.

24:25.196 --> 24:27.065
Alright.

24:27.067 --> 24:29.103
Let me show you
how to work the register.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.716
<i>Goodnight.</i>

25:09.551 --> 25:12.888
<i>Civics test was hard.
All those dates.</i>

25:12.890 --> 25:14.994
Yeah, I know. I'm, I'm behind.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.468
I heard you quit football.

25:19.470 --> 25:21.808
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I had to get a job.

25:23.779 --> 25:25.883
You're working
after school then?

25:26.851 --> 25:28.887
Not today.

25:39.877 --> 25:42.080
- Ruth, where are we going?
- You'll see.

25:52.836 --> 25:54.439
<i>Sorry, I'm late.</i>

26:01.720 --> 26:02.720
Mom?

26:04.023 --> 26:05.893
Talk to your father.

26:05.895 --> 26:07.497
Tell him not to act like a fool.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.901
I am not being foolish.

26:09.903 --> 26:12.238
I put my name on a list,
I waited for my chance

26:12.240 --> 26:13.709
and now they finally have
a place for me.

26:13.711 --> 26:16.279
You don't know anything about
fires. You'll get burned up.

26:16.281 --> 26:18.016
Well, I've been reading
about them. I know enough.

26:18.018 --> 26:20.522
You've been reading about them?
You've been studying up?

26:20.524 --> 26:22.157
Don't turn my words on me, Jean!

26:22.159 --> 26:23.193
Dad, what's going on?

26:23.195 --> 26:24.463
Your father is leaving us

26:24.465 --> 26:26.467
to go and fight those wildfires.

26:26.469 --> 26:28.905
What? Dad, why?

26:28.907 --> 26:30.775
<i>Ask him, Joe. He won't take
a job at a grocery store</i>

26:30.777 --> 26:31.944
<i>but he'll go out
with a bunch of deadbeats</i>

26:31.946 --> 26:33.279
<i>and risk getting killed.</i>

26:33.281 --> 26:35.487
- You don't have to go there...
- <i>What does it pay?</i>

26:36.889 --> 26:38.826
- What?
- What does it pay?

26:41.799 --> 26:44.001
- A dollar an hour.
- Oh, my God.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.339
<i>Jerry, listen, you don't have
to do this. I'm working...</i>

26:46.341 --> 26:47.641
I know,
but it won't be for long.

26:47.643 --> 26:49.045
What if, what if
you get yourself killed?

26:49.047 --> 26:50.447
It's gonna snow.
The fire's gonna go out...

26:50.449 --> 26:52.384
What if it doesn't?
What if it never snows at all?

26:52.386 --> 26:54.789
- Joe, what do you think...
- Oh, my God. Don't ask him...

26:54.791 --> 26:57.361
He's almost grown. He has a say
in what happens...

26:57.363 --> 26:59.332
...your father gets burned up
and you never see him again?

26:59.334 --> 27:01.068
- You guys go straight...
- Don't say that, Jean!

27:01.070 --> 27:02.738
You can't keep running
every time

27:02.740 --> 27:04.007
something doesn't go your way!

27:04.009 --> 27:05.309
<i>You don't know what I'm doing.</i>

27:05.311 --> 27:06.846
Don't I?
I'm a grown woman, Jerry.

27:06.848 --> 27:08.208
<i>Why don't you act
like a grown man?</i>

27:26.787 --> 27:29.023
I wish I had some money
to give you.

27:29.025 --> 27:30.962
I feel like I should.

27:33.768 --> 27:35.705
What are you gonna be
doing out there?

27:37.074 --> 27:39.978
Digging trenches
the fire won't cross.

27:39.980 --> 27:41.917
Doing whatever
they need men for.

27:45.256 --> 27:47.193
How long are you gonna be gone?

27:51.836 --> 27:53.071
I got this hum inside my head.

27:53.073 --> 27:55.076
I... I need to do
something about it.

27:56.312 --> 27:58.381
You understand?

27:58.383 --> 28:00.583
You tell your mother that
I didn't mean to make her mad.

28:03.693 --> 28:07.098
You're too old to give your dad
a kiss, hm?

28:07.100 --> 28:08.935
You know,
men love each other too.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.007
- You know that, don't you?
- Yeah.

29:45.760 --> 29:46.963
He left.

29:49.402 --> 29:51.738
<i>He said that he didn't mean
to make you mad.</i>

29:53.809 --> 29:56.213
He has
very beautiful intentions.

30:00.489 --> 30:02.959
Maybe he's gonna leave me.

30:02.961 --> 30:05.397
<i>I don't think
he's gonna do that.</i>

30:05.399 --> 30:08.169
We haven't been intimate lately.

30:08.171 --> 30:10.108
You're old enough now
to hear that.

30:13.081 --> 30:14.783
Don't answer that.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.544
I told him
we shouldn't have come here.

30:30.315 --> 30:32.384
What kind of a man
leaves his wife and child

30:32.386 --> 30:34.323
in such a lonely place?

30:37.729 --> 30:39.498
You probably think
I'm making too big a deal

30:39.500 --> 30:41.437
out of this, don't you?

30:43.540 --> 30:45.478
I don't know
what you're thinking.

30:57.133 --> 31:00.239
Tomorrow something will happen
to make things feel different.

31:02.745 --> 31:04.014
You think so?

31:17.374 --> 31:18.776
Goodnight, Mom.

32:05.636 --> 32:07.370
You'll have to take
the bus today.

32:07.372 --> 32:09.308
I'm gonna look for a better job.

32:09.310 --> 32:11.177
I thought you liked the Y.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.281
<i>I did.</i>

32:13.850 --> 32:16.622
How do you feel? Strange?

32:16.624 --> 32:17.691
I wouldn't be surprised

32:17.693 --> 32:19.727
with your father
taking off like that.

32:19.729 --> 32:22.866
- Uh, no, I feel fine.
- Good.

32:22.868 --> 32:24.973
No use feeling sorry
for ourselves.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.512
We might have to move
to a smaller place.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.550
Would you mind that?

32:30.552 --> 32:32.419
Well, have... have you talked
with Dad about it?

32:32.421 --> 32:34.658
This fire could go on
for a long time.

32:34.660 --> 32:36.126
I have to be smart about things.

32:36.128 --> 32:39.299
Uh, Dad said he'll be home soon.
As... as soon as it snows.

32:43.910 --> 32:46.880
You're wasting your life standing
there watching me, sweetheart.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.217
Go to school.

32:48.219 --> 32:50.256
Well, will you be here
when I get home?

32:51.825 --> 32:53.428
I'm not going off
to fight any fires

32:53.430 --> 32:55.367
if that's what you're asking.

32:58.038 --> 32:59.509
<i>Take one and pass it down.</i>

33:01.044 --> 33:03.847
<i>You all have 15 minutes
to complete the quiz</i>

33:03.849 --> 33:05.788
<i>on last night's homework.</i>

33:12.567 --> 33:15.136
<i>Sir, I didn't get a chance
to complete the homework.</i>

33:15.138 --> 33:16.240
<i>Why not?</i>

33:16.974 --> 33:19.379
<i>Um, I..</i>

33:19.381 --> 33:22.116
<i>Joe, you're still gonna
have to take the quiz.</i>

33:22.118 --> 33:24.089
<i>Just do better next time.</i>

33:25.224 --> 33:26.495
<i>Okay.</i>

33:47.902 --> 33:49.705
Mickey Mantle
or Bobby Richardson?

33:49.707 --> 33:51.744
Uh, Mickey Mantle..

33:52.979 --> 33:54.949
There's no way
they're gonna win.

33:56.821 --> 33:58.187
Where does your family
come from?

33:58.189 --> 33:59.459
Several places.

34:01.930 --> 34:05.134
- Who do you have for English?
- Miss Todd.

34:05.136 --> 34:07.071
Yeah, I had her last year.

34:07.073 --> 34:08.375
Everybody thinks she's tough

34:08.377 --> 34:10.648
but as long as you do
the reading, she likes you.

34:28.951 --> 34:30.386
It's a neat car.

34:31.889 --> 34:33.158
<i>It's not ours.</i>

34:34.762 --> 34:36.030
It's too bad.

34:40.572 --> 34:43.377
I don't think I have that power.

34:43.379 --> 34:45.481
As a matter of fact,
I think I went to high school

34:45.483 --> 34:47.385
with a gentleman who, uh

34:47.387 --> 34:49.956
is in control
of the boiler of that building.

34:49.958 --> 34:53.697
Well, you have powerful friends
in powerful places.

34:53.699 --> 34:56.302
Maybe for our next class,
you'll find...

34:56.304 --> 34:58.408
Well, that would be fantastic.

35:00.479 --> 35:02.617
Joe, didn't you have work?

35:03.786 --> 35:07.961
- No, not on Tuesdays.
- Oh, right.

35:09.330 --> 35:10.330
Uh..

35:11.634 --> 35:12.768
Where are my manners?

35:12.770 --> 35:16.609
Mr. Miller, this is my son,
Joe Brinson.

35:16.611 --> 35:19.415
It's good to meet you, Joe.

35:19.417 --> 35:21.621
<i>I recently taught Mr. Miller
how to swim.</i>

35:23.089 --> 35:24.825
And he's going to give me
a job at his car dealership.

35:24.827 --> 35:26.564
- Isn't that right?
- Sure is.

35:28.467 --> 35:31.839
- Has Dad called?
- No, he hasn't, sweetheart.

35:31.841 --> 35:34.344
<i>I hear your father
is fighting this fire.</i>

35:34.346 --> 35:36.615
<i>You worried about him?</i>

35:36.617 --> 35:37.985
No, sir.

35:37.987 --> 35:39.924
That's a brave boy
you got there, Jenny.

35:42.194 --> 35:45.131
Warren wants to learn
about poetry.

35:45.133 --> 35:47.204
He's going to borrow
a book from me.

35:48.707 --> 35:50.142
That's correct.

35:53.584 --> 35:55.521
I'll just go and fetch it.

36:04.538 --> 36:06.941
What do you have there?

36:06.943 --> 36:08.544
Toilet part.

36:08.546 --> 36:10.483
Real man of the house, huh?

36:11.519 --> 36:13.456
Doesn't he seem like a nice man?

36:15.760 --> 36:18.366
He fought in two wars
but never learned to swim.

36:19.601 --> 36:21.403
Isn't that odd?

36:21.405 --> 36:24.343
That's not supposed to happen.

36:46.921 --> 36:48.957
Uh, Mom?

36:48.959 --> 36:51.829
- <i>What is it?</i>
- I fixed the toilet.

36:51.831 --> 36:54.535
- <i>What?</i>
- I... I fixed the toilet.

36:54.537 --> 36:56.204
<i>Hold on.</i>

36:56.206 --> 36:58.543
<i>I'm on the phone, sweetheart.</i>

36:58.545 --> 37:01.649
<i>I'm sorry, it's just my son.
What were you saying?</i>

37:01.651 --> 37:03.587
Uh, what time's dinner?

37:59.632 --> 38:02.167
There you are.
Where'd you go?

38:02.169 --> 38:03.705
I was going to make dinner.

38:16.464 --> 38:20.171
Well, how do you like
this particular get-up?

38:21.140 --> 38:22.411
Looks nice.

38:25.749 --> 38:28.620
I used to dress like this
all the time when I was younger.

38:28.622 --> 38:30.691
I'd stand behind
the bull chutes at the rodeo

38:30.693 --> 38:33.495
and hope some cowboy
would approve of me.

38:33.497 --> 38:35.436
Made my father very mad.

38:36.804 --> 38:39.741
They called us chute beauties.

38:39.743 --> 38:41.979
Isn't that an impressive thing
to know about your mother

38:41.981 --> 38:43.849
that she was a chute beauty?

38:43.851 --> 38:45.720
Yeah, Dad told me about it.

38:45.722 --> 38:47.590
He said he liked it.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.059
Yeah, it's probably nice to know

38:49.061 --> 38:51.165
your parents were once
not your parents.

38:55.441 --> 38:57.379
Who were you on the phone with?

38:59.048 --> 39:01.609
Don't worry. If it had been your
father, I would have put you on.

39:06.562 --> 39:08.365
Do you like Miller?

39:08.367 --> 39:10.702
<i>Oh, you mean Mr. Miller?</i>

39:10.704 --> 39:12.641
Yeah, do you like him?

39:13.576 --> 39:15.479
Not very much.

39:15.481 --> 39:16.781
Things do happen
around him though.

39:16.783 --> 39:18.720
He has that feel about him.

39:20.491 --> 39:22.993
And what's his wife like?

39:22.995 --> 39:24.830
<i>He doesn't have one anymore.</i>

39:24.832 --> 39:26.769
She left him, apparently.

39:31.144 --> 39:33.082
How would you like
to skip school tomorrow?

40:04.243 --> 40:06.645
<i>You know what they call trees
in a forest fire?</i>

40:06.647 --> 40:07.916
<i>Fuel.</i>

40:10.255 --> 40:11.688
<i>You know what they call
the trees left up</i>

40:11.690 --> 40:13.629
<i>when the fire goes by?</i>

40:15.765 --> 40:18.704
They call them
the standing dead.

40:22.580 --> 40:25.017
What happens to all the animals
that live out here?

40:26.119 --> 40:28.322
They adapt, I suppose.

40:28.324 --> 40:30.662
<i>Sometimes the little ones
get confused and burn up.</i>

40:32.264 --> 40:33.933
<i>I used to cry about it
when I was a kid</i>

40:33.935 --> 40:37.442
<i>but my father said
that didn't help anything.</i>

40:39.078 --> 40:40.348
You know what?

40:41.383 --> 40:42.818
He was right.

40:54.241 --> 40:56.811
That must be the stage-up.

40:56.813 --> 40:58.750
That's where
the firefighters stay.

41:00.219 --> 41:02.956
Let's drive in and find Dad.

41:02.958 --> 41:04.895
I'm not going looking for him
in this mess.

41:11.141 --> 41:13.580
<i>Ugh, that sickening smell.</i>

41:56.964 --> 41:59.102
Get out there.
See what it feels like.

42:35.874 --> 42:37.311
<i>Do you like it?</i>

42:38.814 --> 42:39.916
No.

42:47.363 --> 42:49.702
You had to see
what he finds so important.

42:52.105 --> 42:54.544
I'm sorry we both can't
sympathize with him.

43:58.704 --> 44:00.641
How do you feel about your name?

44:04.849 --> 44:07.353
I've never thought about it.

44:07.355 --> 44:09.457
<i>We chose it
because it was plain.</i>

44:09.459 --> 44:11.059
<i>Joe.</i>

44:11.061 --> 44:12.999
<i>You could be anyone
with that name.</i>

44:14.067 --> 44:15.268
I suppose.

44:17.675 --> 44:18.944
Jeanette.

44:20.313 --> 44:22.280
I never liked that.

44:22.282 --> 44:24.987
It seemed
like a waitress' name.

44:24.989 --> 44:27.893
<i>What would you
rather be called?</i>

44:27.895 --> 44:31.502
Well, there used to be
a singer named Ladie.

44:33.105 --> 44:34.839
Ladie-dah.

44:34.841 --> 44:37.414
- <i>How would that be?</i>
- I like Jeanette.

44:39.384 --> 44:42.388
You have to like me
the way I am.

44:42.390 --> 44:44.828
Anyway, I guess at my age,
I don't have much choice.

44:46.465 --> 44:47.901
How old are you?

44:50.505 --> 44:51.942
I'm 34.

44:53.578 --> 44:55.515
Does that seem
like the wrong age?

44:57.453 --> 44:59.390
Would you like it better
if I said I was 50?

45:00.993 --> 45:03.563
No, 34 is alright.

45:03.565 --> 45:05.200
Alright.

45:05.202 --> 45:07.104
Well, I won't be
this age forever

45:07.106 --> 45:09.075
so don't get used to it.

45:14.587 --> 45:16.624
<i>I think your father
has a woman out here.</i>

45:18.060 --> 45:19.528
<i>He wouldn't do that.</i>

45:19.530 --> 45:22.533
No? Why do you think
men do things?

45:22.535 --> 45:25.172
They either go crazy
or it's a woman. Or it's both.

45:25.174 --> 45:26.441
I... I don't think that's true.

45:26.443 --> 45:27.643
You don't know anything.
How could you?

45:27.645 --> 45:29.249
You haven't done anything.

45:39.702 --> 45:41.640
He's gonna be alright, Mom.

45:43.844 --> 45:44.946
Yeah.

45:49.488 --> 45:50.925
What about me?

45:55.166 --> 45:57.137
You're gonna be alright too.

46:23.555 --> 46:24.992
Where are we?

46:28.265 --> 46:29.867
That's Warren's house.

46:32.273 --> 46:33.508
Mr. Miller.

46:34.744 --> 46:36.681
<i>I looked it up
in the phonebook.</i>

46:39.388 --> 46:42.023
What? Are we going inside?

46:42.025 --> 46:43.127
No.

46:44.330 --> 46:46.601
I had something to ask him,
but it can wait.

46:50.342 --> 46:52.713
<i>He doesn't live
like a rich man, does he?</i>

46:54.383 --> 46:56.888
<i>Just a plain house
on a plain street.</i>

47:04.669 --> 47:06.671
I feel like I need to wake up..

47:09.279 --> 47:11.215
...but I don't know what from.

47:12.852 --> 47:14.121
Or to.

47:17.362 --> 47:19.131
<i>That's a big change.</i>

47:21.670 --> 47:22.839
Mom?

47:27.614 --> 47:29.551
Come on, let's get you home.

47:53.933 --> 47:56.403
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

47:56.405 --> 47:58.673
Mm, looks good.

47:58.675 --> 48:01.245
I'll start the car

48:01.247 --> 48:04.285
and you can tell us about going
back to the world fair today.

48:04.287 --> 48:07.559
- Did you have fun?
- I sure did.

48:07.561 --> 48:09.162
Everything I saw was..

48:26.096 --> 48:27.632
Mom?

48:31.640 --> 48:33.210
Mom?

48:36.182 --> 48:37.451
Hello?

48:37.453 --> 48:39.622
<i>Joe, what's going on
over there?</i>

48:39.624 --> 48:42.360
- <i>Why aren't you at school?</i>
- Oh, Dad, Dad. Are you okay?

48:42.362 --> 48:44.634
<i>I'm fine.
Where's your mother?</i>

48:45.735 --> 48:47.572
<i>Uh, she, uh..</i>

48:48.941 --> 48:51.010
She went into town, I..

48:51.012 --> 48:53.681
H... how are things up there?

48:53.683 --> 48:56.287
<i>It's a mess, really, but
we don't have control over it.</i>

48:56.289 --> 48:58.425
<i>We just watch it burn.</i>

48:58.427 --> 49:00.364
A... are you coming home soon?

49:01.966 --> 49:04.770
<i>Uh, how's school going?</i>

49:36.066 --> 49:39.237
- Can I help you, honey?
- Oh, yes.

49:39.239 --> 49:41.976
I'm, I'm looking for my mother,
Jeanette Brinson.

49:41.978 --> 49:44.382
Oh, I don't think we've had
a customer by that name today.

49:44.384 --> 49:46.656
No, no, she... she works
for Mr. Miller.

49:48.760 --> 49:51.396
Or maybe she's seeing him
about a job.

49:51.398 --> 49:52.933
I don't think..

50:24.763 --> 50:26.367
Cameron, look right there.

50:34.516 --> 50:36.718
Move a little closer.
Yeah, that's perfect.

50:36.720 --> 50:38.724
Yeah, you look great. Alright.

50:53.453 --> 50:54.453
Mom?

51:11.153 --> 51:12.255
<i>Mom.</i>

51:14.126 --> 51:15.563
Where have you been?

51:17.967 --> 51:20.671
You weren't there
when I woke up.

51:20.673 --> 51:22.008
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

51:25.983 --> 51:27.420
Dad called.

51:29.223 --> 51:30.724
When?

51:30.726 --> 51:31.994
<i>This morning.</i>

51:32.996 --> 51:35.400
<i>When you were gone.</i>

51:35.402 --> 51:37.972
Did you have a nice chat
about me?

51:37.974 --> 51:40.244
All my character flaws
on parade.

51:41.715 --> 51:43.852
<i>No, I... I think he misses us.</i>

51:49.998 --> 51:51.935
Where'd you say I was?

51:54.205 --> 51:56.240
I said you went into town.

51:56.242 --> 51:59.045
<i>Yes, I went to the dealership</i>

51:59.047 --> 52:01.320
<i>to get a few things done
just to get started.</i>

52:02.789 --> 52:04.726
You were there this morning?

52:05.695 --> 52:07.061
Don't worry.

52:07.063 --> 52:09.232
It'll only be part-time.

52:09.234 --> 52:11.339
I still have a son to raise,
I think.

52:13.476 --> 52:15.279
<i>Here, put this on.</i>

52:17.017 --> 52:18.116
Why?

52:18.118 --> 52:20.755
Mr. Miller invited us over
for dinner.

53:09.521 --> 53:12.325
This is my desperation dress.
What do you think?

53:15.197 --> 53:17.567
I think Dad would like it.

53:17.569 --> 53:20.240
<i>I'm sure he would.
And as much as he paid for.</i>

53:22.412 --> 53:24.381
Those are the Helen Apartments.

53:24.383 --> 53:27.219
A couple of the girls
from the Y live there.

53:27.221 --> 53:29.727
What would you think of that?
Living by the river?

53:32.399 --> 53:33.568
I like our house.

53:35.170 --> 53:37.774
It's not our house, Joe.
It's a rental.

53:40.114 --> 53:41.684
Ugh, Canada.

53:42.619 --> 53:44.890
I live near Canada now. My God!

53:46.727 --> 53:48.831
I can't stand Canada tonight.

53:55.811 --> 53:58.915
<i>You look like a beauty
pageant queen, Jeanette.</i>

53:58.917 --> 54:01.088
I was on one occasion.

54:03.058 --> 54:05.395
You should always say
nice things to women

54:05.397 --> 54:07.800
especially your mother.

54:07.802 --> 54:09.904
What will you have to drink,
Jeanette?

54:09.906 --> 54:11.540
Oh, just a little something.

54:11.542 --> 54:13.647
Gotta keep my wits about me
with you two.

54:15.016 --> 54:16.951
<i>Tell me, Joe,
how's your old man?</i>

54:16.953 --> 54:20.624
- <i>Is he coming home soon?</i>
- I hope so.

54:20.626 --> 54:21.963
Who's this?

54:23.732 --> 54:26.169
Oh, that's my wife..

54:26.171 --> 54:27.638
...formerly.

54:27.640 --> 54:29.542
I'm sure she regrets leaving.

54:29.544 --> 54:32.515
Well, she hasn't called me up
and said so.

54:32.517 --> 54:34.151
Poor old thing.

54:34.153 --> 54:36.257
Nobody's nice enough to you.

54:37.259 --> 54:38.329
Muah.

54:39.631 --> 54:41.766
It was never like this
in Washington.

54:41.768 --> 54:43.436
Or Idaho.

54:43.438 --> 54:45.206
Every time we've moved,
it's gotten colder.

54:45.208 --> 54:48.546
Your husband had to go
where the work was.

54:48.548 --> 54:52.954
He had work in Idaho,
but he insisted on leaving.

54:52.956 --> 54:55.493
You don't get anywhere
if you don't try.

54:55.495 --> 54:57.597
I started with a small farm

54:57.599 --> 54:59.468
and simply never stopped
trying for more.

54:59.470 --> 55:01.237
Well, that's different.

55:01.239 --> 55:03.377
You worked for your success.

55:03.379 --> 55:05.780
Jerry's always looking
for a shortcut.

55:05.782 --> 55:07.550
He gets an idea in his head
about what's gonna

55:07.552 --> 55:09.556
make him happy
and he won't let go.

55:11.092 --> 55:13.863
I respect
what your father's doing.

55:13.865 --> 55:16.804
<i>When he comes home, I'm gonna
discuss a job with him.</i>

55:18.640 --> 55:20.678
Well, that... that's great.
Isn't it, Mom?

55:22.114 --> 55:24.652
Well, I'm glad someone's here
to take care of us.

55:28.361 --> 55:30.094
Tell me, Joe

55:30.096 --> 55:32.377
have you thought about what
you want to do with your life?

55:35.507 --> 55:36.841
Um..

55:36.843 --> 55:39.479
Uh, no, not really.

55:39.481 --> 55:42.552
Uh, maybe I'd like to work
at a, a railroad someday.

55:42.554 --> 55:44.991
No, that's not very good.

55:44.993 --> 55:46.626
You need to come up
with a better answer.

55:46.628 --> 55:49.032
- Kid's only 15, Jenny.
- <i>14.</i>

55:49.034 --> 55:51.138
See? Plenty of time.

55:53.009 --> 55:54.976
Your mother says you want to go
to school back east.

55:54.978 --> 55:56.279
- Is that true?
- No.

55:56.281 --> 55:58.684
I, I... I wanna go to school
where my parents went.

55:58.686 --> 56:01.723
- <i>Washington State.</i>
- No, you don't, believe me.

56:01.725 --> 56:03.192
You said you liked it there.

56:03.194 --> 56:07.167
Well, what do I know?
I left before I hardly started.

56:07.169 --> 56:09.906
You wanna grow up
to be like Warren.

56:09.908 --> 56:11.575
He went to Dartmouth.

56:11.577 --> 56:16.285
Yes, but I learned everything
that meant anything in the army.

56:16.287 --> 56:18.256
But the army
didn't make you rich.

56:18.258 --> 56:19.459
No.

56:19.461 --> 56:21.997
Other people's incompetency
made me rich.

56:21.999 --> 56:25.170
Money begets money
based on no other principle.

56:25.172 --> 56:29.043
Just because we're... poor
doesn't mean we're incompetent.

56:29.045 --> 56:30.381
Of course not.

56:30.383 --> 56:31.582
But money begets money

56:31.584 --> 56:33.018
and that's how
the rich stay rich

56:33.020 --> 56:34.822
and the poor stay poor, right?

56:34.824 --> 56:36.761
That's not what I'm saying
at all.

56:45.077 --> 56:46.811
Would you mind very much
telling me

56:46.813 --> 56:49.351
where the little girl's room is?

56:49.353 --> 56:51.289
Just through the bedroom.

57:04.517 --> 57:06.554
<i>Put that record on, won't you?</i>

57:41.690 --> 57:43.793
Have you ever been up
in an airplane, Joe?

57:45.095 --> 57:47.064
No, sir.

57:47.066 --> 57:49.770
I own one. I could take you up
sometime if you'd like.

57:51.308 --> 57:54.012
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- We could take your mother.

58:00.693 --> 58:02.961
<i>Once it was fall like now.</i>

58:02.963 --> 58:04.798
Only colder.

58:04.800 --> 58:07.404
I was flying up to look
at some poor man's failed crop

58:07.406 --> 58:09.140
and suddenly

58:09.142 --> 58:12.514
there were all these geese
in formations, you know.

58:12.516 --> 58:13.852
Big Vs.

58:15.221 --> 58:18.359
Do you know what I did?

58:18.361 --> 58:22.032
<i>I turned the engine off,
4000 feet up</i>

58:22.034 --> 58:23.869
<i>so I could listen.</i>

58:23.871 --> 58:25.674
They were all around me

58:25.676 --> 58:27.977
honking and honking
up in the sky

58:27.979 --> 58:32.218
where no one ever heard them
except God Himself.

58:32.220 --> 58:34.725
<i>And I thought..</i>

58:34.727 --> 58:37.396
<i>...this is like
seeing an angel.</i>

58:37.398 --> 58:40.969
<i>It was the most wonderful thing
I ever did in my life.</i>

58:40.971 --> 58:42.408
<i>Ever will do.</i>

58:43.812 --> 58:45.013
Were you afraid?

58:47.652 --> 58:49.589
Yes, I was afraid.

58:50.924 --> 58:54.597
Because in that moment,
I had lost all humanity.

58:54.599 --> 58:57.803
I had all these people
on the ground trusting in me.

58:57.805 --> 59:01.745
My wife and my mother
and my four businesses.

59:01.747 --> 59:04.449
But they didn't matter to me
in the slightest.

59:04.451 --> 59:05.853
Not that I didn't care
about them.

59:05.855 --> 59:08.291
I just didn't even think
about them at all.

59:11.732 --> 59:13.871
Do you understand
what I'm talking about, Joe?

59:16.675 --> 59:17.778
I..

59:19.013 --> 59:20.115
Yes, sir.

59:23.689 --> 59:25.627
You want a glass of wine?

59:31.405 --> 59:32.405
Yeah, okay.

59:40.188 --> 59:41.792
Here's to the angels..

59:43.227 --> 59:45.363
...and to your old man
not getting burned up

59:45.365 --> 59:47.303
like a piece of bacon.

59:49.005 --> 59:50.442
Uh, thank you.

59:56.621 --> 01:00:00.091
Mm. Look now,
the pretty lady's back.

01:00:00.093 --> 01:00:02.498
Why is it so gloomy in here?

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.334
Someone put on
some dancing music.

01:00:04.336 --> 01:00:07.174
- Oh, we'll dance.
- Mom, I have homework.

01:00:23.507 --> 01:00:25.107
Cha-cha-cha.

01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:26.547
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:00:28.148 --> 01:00:30.183
Cha-cha-cha.

01:00:30.185 --> 01:00:32.087
Cha-cha-cha.

01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:33.725
Cha-cha-cha.

01:00:33.727 --> 01:00:34.894
Come on, Joe.

01:00:34.896 --> 01:00:36.998
Dance with your mother.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.133
<i>Come on.</i>

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.338
<i>Joe, dance with your mother.</i>

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.444
Come, da.. Joe, come dance
with your mother.

01:00:44.014 --> 01:00:45.182
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:00:46.151 --> 01:00:47.217
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:00:47.219 --> 01:00:49.088
<i>There you go.</i>

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:50.460
Aww.

01:00:52.163 --> 01:00:53.998
Cha-cha-cha.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.403
Cha-cha-cha.

01:00:56.103 --> 01:00:57.639
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:00:57.641 --> 01:00:58.774
<i>Joe!</i>

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:02.016
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:01:03.352 --> 01:01:05.152
Cha-cha-cha.

01:01:05.154 --> 01:01:08.093
Joe, you're a terrible dancer.

01:01:08.095 --> 01:01:10.030
I'm ashamed of you.

01:01:10.032 --> 01:01:13.436
Warren, you'll have
to dance with me.

01:01:13.438 --> 01:01:15.075
There's nobody else.

01:01:17.113 --> 01:01:19.147
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:01:19.149 --> 01:01:20.218
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:01:21.153 --> 01:01:23.088
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:24.925
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:01:24.927 --> 01:01:26.229
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:01:27.197 --> 01:01:28.367
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:30.971
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:01:30.973 --> 01:01:32.442
<i>Cha-cha-cha.</i>

01:01:35.683 --> 01:01:37.182
<i>Look, Joe.</i>

01:01:37.184 --> 01:01:39.020
<i>Warren's a man who can dance.</i>

01:01:39.022 --> 01:01:41.591
<i>He's one in a million.</i>

01:03:46.373 --> 01:03:48.107
Your mother
is a very passionate dancer.

01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:50.079
<i>Did you know that, Joe?</i>

01:03:52.016 --> 01:03:54.087
It means I go till I drop.

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:01.434
<i>When Joe's father and I
first got married</i>

01:04:01.436 --> 01:04:04.373
<i>I rented a little
sailor costume</i>

01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:06.879
and I did a little tap dance
when he got home from work.

01:04:14.294 --> 01:04:16.763
It was an anniversary present.

01:04:16.765 --> 01:04:19.003
- He loved it.
- <i>I bet he did.</i>

01:04:31.027 --> 01:04:32.795
We have to go.

01:04:32.797 --> 01:04:35.133
I'm irritable all of a sudden
and Joe's bored.

01:04:35.135 --> 01:04:36.970
<i>Well, you can't drive
in this condition.</i>

01:04:36.972 --> 01:04:38.473
- Stay the night.
- No.

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:39.808
<i>Come on.
There's another bedroom.</i>

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:41.247
I can drive us.

01:04:43.751 --> 01:04:45.155
Uh, Dad taught me.

01:04:48.026 --> 01:04:49.128
See?

01:04:50.265 --> 01:04:51.535
Joe can drive us.

01:04:53.439 --> 01:04:56.545
Well, you can put a coat on
at least.

01:04:57.679 --> 01:04:59.048
Wait here.

01:05:10.904 --> 01:05:12.842
You don't mind, do you?

01:05:14.712 --> 01:05:16.781
No.

01:05:16.783 --> 01:05:18.286
I like driving.

01:05:21.759 --> 01:05:24.195
"Calm that experience."

01:05:24.197 --> 01:05:25.665
That's what my mother
used to call it

01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:28.205
when my father
would roar in drunk.

01:05:30.377 --> 01:05:32.647
Don't worry,
I'll get us home safely.

01:05:36.489 --> 01:05:37.925
You're a good boy.

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:41.963
One day, you'll get
a big promotion

01:05:41.965 --> 01:05:43.334
which is to say you'll be grown.

01:05:43.336 --> 01:05:44.736
You can leave.

01:05:44.738 --> 01:05:46.342
<i>This should do the job.</i>

01:05:48.346 --> 01:05:51.484
Don't you have
one of your wife's coats?

01:05:51.486 --> 01:05:53.555
They're in a bag somewhere
to be thrown away.

01:05:53.557 --> 01:05:54.625
Here.

01:06:18.472 --> 01:06:20.409
Come on, Joe. The fun's over.

01:06:32.098 --> 01:06:34.035
My heart's just pounding away.

01:06:39.045 --> 01:06:41.783
I drank too much.
That makes your heart race.

01:06:44.054 --> 01:06:46.492
I don't wanna wear this coat.

01:06:46.494 --> 01:06:47.826
Mom!

01:06:47.828 --> 01:06:50.333
Can you imagine
what the neighbors would say?

01:06:50.335 --> 01:06:52.305
Stay there.
I'll be back in a minute.

01:09:07.337 --> 01:09:09.973
Well..

01:09:09.975 --> 01:09:12.412
...I surprised myself
and had a good time.

01:09:12.413 --> 01:09:14.214
Did you?

01:09:41.002 --> 01:09:42.270
There you go.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.520
Can you smile?

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:53.158
Get the smile.

01:09:55.263 --> 01:09:58.470
<i>Across Northern Montana,
we're still waiting for snow.</i>

01:10:01.677 --> 01:10:03.812
<i>The low tonight
for Great Falls..</i>

01:10:08.057 --> 01:10:09.392
<i>Local news..</i>

01:11:15.489 --> 01:11:17.658
<i>Shh. Be quiet.</i>

01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:20.162
<i>Okay. I'm trying.</i>

01:11:20.164 --> 01:11:21.668
<i>Hurry up. Get dressed.</i>

01:11:40.738 --> 01:11:41.907
<i>Shh.</i>

01:14:03.685 --> 01:14:06.156
Goddammit!

01:14:06.158 --> 01:14:08.561
You scared me! Oh, God!

01:14:08.563 --> 01:14:11.031
You scared me. You can... you
cannot sneak up on me like that.

01:14:11.033 --> 01:14:12.868
I didn't mean to.

01:14:16.912 --> 01:14:18.713
What was he doing here?

01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:20.185
What does it matter?

01:14:22.289 --> 01:14:23.759
Do you love him?

01:14:31.173 --> 01:14:33.144
Do you still love Dad?

01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:43.061
He wants to make things better.

01:14:43.063 --> 01:14:45.368
Maybe I'm not up to that,
I don't know.

01:14:47.204 --> 01:14:48.975
I wish I was dead.

01:14:52.449 --> 01:14:55.020
If you've got a better plan
for me, tell me.

01:14:56.323 --> 01:14:58.494
I'll try it. Really.

01:14:59.663 --> 01:15:01.667
Maybe it will be better
than this.

01:15:05.006 --> 01:15:06.610
I don't have one.

01:17:34.768 --> 01:17:37.039
Ah, hey.

01:17:38.576 --> 01:17:41.314
Oh, I thought I would
never see you again.

01:17:42.917 --> 01:17:44.351
- How are you doing?
- I'm good.

01:17:44.353 --> 01:17:45.856
Okay. Here.

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:53.605
Here, Dad.

01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:05.094
Go on, put that up.

01:18:09.403 --> 01:18:11.337
Hi, Jean.

01:18:11.339 --> 01:18:12.743
<i>Hello, Jerry.</i>

01:18:21.092 --> 01:18:23.229
I don't know who I'm waiting
to impress here.

01:18:34.786 --> 01:18:36.320
You smell like a campfire.

01:18:36.322 --> 01:18:38.292
Well, I should.
I've been out in it.

01:18:39.293 --> 01:18:41.664
- Are you hungry?
- Mm.

01:18:41.666 --> 01:18:43.603
<i>No, we ate on the road.</i>

01:18:45.708 --> 01:18:46.741
You must be tired.

01:18:49.749 --> 01:18:51.018
Come, sit down.

01:19:04.778 --> 01:19:08.182
<i>Well, how was the fire?
Did you put it out?</i>

01:19:08.184 --> 01:19:09.283
Well, we got most of it.

01:19:09.285 --> 01:19:11.287
The snow should take out
the rest.

01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:12.426
That's good.

01:19:13.796 --> 01:19:15.800
Yeah, it was,
it was hell out there.

01:19:17.035 --> 01:19:18.837
Can't tell ya. I..

01:19:18.839 --> 01:19:20.707
...had to stop a man
from running in the fire.

01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:22.744
- I had to drag him down.
- <i>It sounds dangerous.</i>

01:19:22.746 --> 01:19:25.450
It was.
But I'm happy to be home.

01:19:25.452 --> 01:19:27.890
Well, we're glad you came.

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:35.539
I have some good news.

01:19:37.776 --> 01:19:39.511
I talked to a man up there
about a job

01:19:39.513 --> 01:19:43.285
at the Forestry Department
up at the eastern front.

01:19:43.287 --> 01:19:46.224
<i>And they'd even provide us
with a house.</i>

01:19:46.226 --> 01:19:48.996
But we'd have to move again?

01:19:48.998 --> 01:19:51.302
Well, you know,
it's not that far.

01:19:51.304 --> 01:19:53.507
And plus, it's a good time
to be up there, you know.

01:19:54.843 --> 01:19:56.947
I have something
to tell you too.

01:20:02.057 --> 01:20:03.694
What is it, Jean?

01:20:11.008 --> 01:20:13.079
I have taken
an apartment in town..

01:20:14.381 --> 01:20:15.516
...for myself..

01:20:16.585 --> 01:20:18.522
<i>...and I can move in tomorrow.</i>

01:20:20.526 --> 01:20:22.495
<i>It's a tiny place,
but I can afford the rent</i>

01:20:22.497 --> 01:20:24.768
<i>and there's room for Joe
if he wants to come.</i>

01:20:27.674 --> 01:20:30.480
It's a surprise, I know.
I'm surprised myself.

01:20:33.953 --> 01:20:36.324
Have you lost your mind, Jean?

01:20:36.326 --> 01:20:38.261
No, I don't think I have.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.833
Well, you can't... you can't
get mad at me

01:20:41.835 --> 01:20:44.505
'cause I went to some fire.

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:46.575
I'm not.

01:20:46.577 --> 01:20:48.479
I was, I'm not anymore.

01:20:48.481 --> 01:20:51.085
Well, then what... what is it?

01:20:51.087 --> 01:20:53.858
<i>Ah, I need some time
to figure things out.</i>

01:20:54.995 --> 01:20:56.398
<i>Figure what out?</i>

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:11.427
Jean, are you
stepping out on me?

01:21:20.044 --> 01:21:22.146
Yes, I am.

01:21:22.148 --> 01:21:24.119
But this doesn't
have to do with that.

01:21:25.788 --> 01:21:27.058
<i>Who is it?</i>

01:21:30.399 --> 01:21:31.666
<i>Who is it?</i>

01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:35.273
Uh, it's Warren Miller.

01:21:39.682 --> 01:21:40.885
Miller?

01:21:43.056 --> 01:21:45.026
I've been teaching him at the Y.

01:21:47.064 --> 01:21:49.001
Oh, you've been teachin' him?

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:53.841
Are you movin' in with him?

01:21:53.843 --> 01:21:55.011
Joe, go to your room.

01:21:55.013 --> 01:21:57.215
Jean, are you moving in
with him?

01:21:57.217 --> 01:21:59.387
No, I told you,
I'm taking an apartment.

01:21:59.389 --> 01:22:01.089
The Helen Apartments.
They're down by the river.

01:22:01.091 --> 01:22:03.028
<i>I know where they are.</i>

01:22:05.834 --> 01:22:07.103
Christ!

01:22:09.975 --> 01:22:12.479
<i>What? Are you... you havin'
a, a hard week?</i>

01:22:12.481 --> 01:22:15.351
<i>- Is that it?
- No, not very hard.</i>

01:22:15.353 --> 01:22:17.390
<i>Or are we not getting along?</i>

01:22:18.559 --> 01:22:19.895
<i>I think so.</i>

01:22:21.499 --> 01:22:23.268
Boy, boy, boy!

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:27.276
Boy!

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.160
I won't have this conversation
if you won't take me seriously.

01:22:35.859 --> 01:22:37.026
Stop it.

01:22:39.767 --> 01:22:41.903
<i>Well, it's a wild life,
isn't it, son?</i>

01:22:41.905 --> 01:22:44.109
Leave him be. He doesn't know
what is and what isn't.

01:22:58.338 --> 01:23:00.309
I think I'm wasted on you.

01:23:02.779 --> 01:23:04.716
I think you are too.

01:23:27.828 --> 01:23:30.265
It'd be nice to live on the
eastern front. Don't you think?

01:23:30.267 --> 01:23:34.105
You think... your mother
would take a chance on it?

01:23:34.107 --> 01:23:35.544
Yeah, sure, Dad.

01:23:39.485 --> 01:23:42.757
You know, she just needs
something to believe in again.

01:23:42.759 --> 01:23:43.960
You'll see.

01:23:48.235 --> 01:23:51.141
Go on.
Have some of that delicious pie.

01:24:02.597 --> 01:24:05.334
<i>You know, I'm surprised
about this Miller though.</i>

01:24:05.336 --> 01:24:07.136
<i>You know, I mean..</i>

01:24:07.138 --> 01:24:09.109
<i>...has it been going on
for a long time?</i>

01:24:12.818 --> 01:24:14.786
I don't know.

01:24:14.788 --> 01:24:15.788
You know, I just, I don't

01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:16.856
believe
that she would choose him.

01:24:16.858 --> 01:24:19.595
You know, he's an old man and..

01:24:19.597 --> 01:24:21.666
...he's married at that.

01:24:21.668 --> 01:24:23.338
<i>He's not married anymore.</i>

01:24:28.113 --> 01:24:30.050
What? You know him then?

01:24:31.588 --> 01:24:33.325
No, I..

01:24:34.761 --> 01:24:36.698
I... I've met him once.

01:24:39.235 --> 01:24:41.172
When did you happen to meet him?

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:46.715
He... he just stopped
by the house.

01:24:46.717 --> 01:24:48.889
W... what happened
when he stopped by the house?

01:24:50.691 --> 01:24:52.660
Nothing.

01:24:52.662 --> 01:24:54.599
He... he borrowed a book.

01:24:59.309 --> 01:25:01.814
You.. You never see him again?

01:25:18.881 --> 01:25:20.748
Where did you see him again?

01:25:27.898 --> 01:25:30.535
Mother and I went to his house.

01:25:30.537 --> 01:25:32.541
We had our dinner there.

01:25:36.916 --> 01:25:38.050
You did.

01:25:40.957 --> 01:25:42.025
When?

01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:45.366
<i>A few nights ago.</i>

01:25:50.009 --> 01:25:52.112
- Did you stay all night?
- No.

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:55.819
No, we ate and then we left
and that's all.

01:26:11.952 --> 01:26:14.688
Did your mother
do something that..

01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:16.794
...you wouldn't like
to have to tell me about?

01:26:24.241 --> 01:26:25.876
<i>Joe.</i>

01:26:29.953 --> 01:26:31.822
Did you see them, uh, together?

01:26:43.212 --> 01:26:44.313
Yes.

01:26:57.073 --> 01:26:58.843
<i>Where'd you see them?</i>

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:04.320
- They were in the house.
- <i>In our house?</i>

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.630
Dad!

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:38.253
<i>Dad.</i>

01:27:40.693 --> 01:27:42.193
Dad.

01:27:42.195 --> 01:27:43.997
<i>Dad, please,
we should just go home now.</i>

01:27:43.999 --> 01:27:45.936
Stay in the car, Joe.

01:28:04.372 --> 01:28:06.809
What the hell's going on?

01:28:06.811 --> 01:28:08.113
<i>Jerry.</i>

01:28:09.382 --> 01:28:10.382
Dad.

01:28:11.887 --> 01:28:14.824
- Dad, Dad.
- <i>Get out here, Miller!</i>

01:28:14.826 --> 01:28:17.696
Dad, Dad.
What's wrong with you?

01:28:17.698 --> 01:28:19.633
How could you?

01:28:19.635 --> 01:28:21.237
How could you do this?

01:28:21.239 --> 01:28:22.806
<i>Dad.</i>

01:28:22.808 --> 01:28:25.110
Jerry! Goddammit, Jerry!

01:28:25.112 --> 01:28:26.814
You are a goddamn drunk!

01:28:26.816 --> 01:28:28.852
<i>You hear me, a fool and a drunk</i>

01:28:28.854 --> 01:28:29.954
<i>and you've ruined my house.</i>

01:28:29.956 --> 01:28:32.659
- Fuck you, Miller.
- No, no, no, no!

01:28:32.661 --> 01:28:35.665
Get away.
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

01:28:35.667 --> 01:28:37.368
- Stop!
- <i>Who is that?</i>

01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:39.340
- None of your business!
- Where's my wife?

01:28:39.342 --> 01:28:41.476
How should I know?

01:28:41.478 --> 01:28:44.382
<i>Goddammit, Jerry,
you have a son here.</i>

01:28:44.384 --> 01:28:45.952
<i>What do you think's
gonna happen now?</i>

01:28:45.954 --> 01:28:48.326
<i>The police are coming.
They'll put you in jail.</i>

01:28:49.728 --> 01:28:51.030
<i>I'd be ashamed.</i>

01:28:53.034 --> 01:28:54.836
Come on.

01:28:54.838 --> 01:28:56.374
<i>Joe.</i>

01:28:56.376 --> 01:28:58.344
<i>What are you standing
around looking at?</i>

01:28:58.346 --> 01:29:00.648
Joe, come on, come on, help me.
Give me a hand.

01:29:02.553 --> 01:29:03.622
Joe.

01:29:05.993 --> 01:29:06.993
Joe!

01:31:23.797 --> 01:31:25.834
Yes? Can I help you?

01:31:30.679 --> 01:31:32.348
<i>What is it, son?</i>

01:31:53.889 --> 01:31:56.730
<i>- Where did you go?
- Are you okay?</i>

01:31:58.366 --> 01:32:00.370
I went to the police station.

01:32:03.141 --> 01:32:05.078
I thought you'd be there.

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:12.761
Oh, I... I, I talked
to Mr. Miller and, uh..

01:32:14.398 --> 01:32:16.468
...we agreed
that it was a misunderstanding..

01:32:18.406 --> 01:32:20.343
...and he's not
gonna press charges.

01:32:24.082 --> 01:32:26.687
What's going to happen?

01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:29.358
<i>Nothing. I'm in the clear.</i>

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.598
No, I mean, what's going
to happen to us?

01:32:45.191 --> 01:32:46.361
Mom..

01:32:48.197 --> 01:32:50.133
<i>...what's going
to happen to us?</i>

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.350
I don't know.

01:33:10.341 --> 01:33:11.841
I'm going to bed.
I have school tomorrow.

01:33:11.843 --> 01:33:13.045
<i>Joe.</i>

01:33:19.659 --> 01:33:21.730
I won't blame you
if you hate me.

01:33:30.078 --> 01:33:31.415
Goodnight.

01:34:41.085 --> 01:34:43.120
Sorry, I'm late.

01:34:43.122 --> 01:34:44.392
<i>That's okay.</i>

01:34:46.363 --> 01:34:47.630
You eat?

01:34:47.632 --> 01:34:49.834
<i>Yeah, we had something in town
after school.</i>

01:34:49.836 --> 01:34:51.605
Good.

01:34:51.607 --> 01:34:54.177
- Finish your homework?
- <i>Almost.</i>

01:34:56.449 --> 01:34:59.754
Alright. Watch the game later?

01:34:59.756 --> 01:35:01.457
<i>Ah, I... I promised Ruth
I'd study with her</i>

01:35:01.459 --> 01:35:03.429
but maybe I'll catch
the end with you.

01:35:07.437 --> 01:35:09.439
<i>Joe, letter for you.</i>

01:35:45.879 --> 01:35:48.418
What does she say?
Is she still in Portland?

01:35:49.954 --> 01:35:51.289
Yeah, she's fine.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.333
She... she wants to come visit
and she bought a ticket.

01:35:57.837 --> 01:35:59.104
When?

01:35:59.106 --> 01:36:02.345
<i>Uh, she arrives at 5:00 p.m.
on the 20th.</i>

01:36:03.815 --> 01:36:05.451
What, April 20th?

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.057
<i>That's tomorrow.</i>

01:36:13.167 --> 01:36:15.336
Can I have the car?

01:36:15.338 --> 01:36:17.675
I can, uh, I can pick her up
after school.

01:36:20.046 --> 01:36:21.882
Well, Joe, um,
you don't know her plans.

01:36:21.884 --> 01:36:23.888
You don't know how long
she's gonna be here for.

01:36:24.923 --> 01:36:27.194
I know. It... it's fine.

01:36:30.167 --> 01:36:31.469
Okay.

01:36:36.379 --> 01:36:37.982
Thanks, Dad.

01:37:21.267 --> 01:37:22.536
You've grown.

01:37:23.672 --> 01:37:25.342
Yeah, well, I'm trying.

01:37:26.611 --> 01:37:28.682
Couple more inches
would be nice.

01:37:32.188 --> 01:37:34.557
But how's Oregon?

01:37:34.559 --> 01:37:37.232
It's not always what I expected,
but I'm getting along.

01:37:38.335 --> 01:37:39.935
And how are your students?

01:37:39.937 --> 01:37:41.772
They're fine.

01:37:41.774 --> 01:37:44.244
- Yeah?
- Some of them like me, I think.

01:37:44.246 --> 01:37:46.448
And I've made
some good friends at work.

01:37:46.450 --> 01:37:48.986
- Joe tell you the good news?
- What news?

01:37:48.988 --> 01:37:49.990
Dad.

01:37:51.192 --> 01:37:53.129
He made the honor roll again.

01:37:54.566 --> 01:37:56.971
- That's wonderful.
- Thank you.

01:38:01.579 --> 01:38:03.583
- Can I..
- Sure. Thank you.

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.562
And how is work, Jerry?

01:38:10.564 --> 01:38:12.400
Good.

01:38:12.402 --> 01:38:14.538
Turns out I do fine
as a salesman.

01:38:16.242 --> 01:38:17.743
I'll send you some money
when I can.

01:38:17.745 --> 01:38:19.882
Oh, you don't have to do that.

01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:24.590
<i>Joe?</i>

01:38:26.696 --> 01:38:28.700
So how long
will you be here for?

01:38:30.002 --> 01:38:32.939
Just through the weekend.

01:38:32.941 --> 01:38:35.046
<i>I have to be back at work
on Tuesday.</i>

01:38:42.361 --> 01:38:45.264
Uh, can you stop by
the photo shop tomorrow?

01:38:45.266 --> 01:38:48.637
I, um, wanna show you something.

01:38:48.639 --> 01:38:52.010
- You're still working there?
- <i>Yeah, on weekends.</i>

01:38:52.012 --> 01:38:55.249
- He's been promoted.
- <i>Is that so?</i>

01:38:55.251 --> 01:38:57.957
Yes. Yeah, I'm, uh,
I'm taking portraits now.

01:39:00.695 --> 01:39:02.834
But will you come by?

01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:05.672
Both of you.

01:39:13.621 --> 01:39:15.357
So we have some cameras
and frames here

01:39:15.359 --> 01:39:17.896
and people can come,
get their negatives developed.

01:39:19.198 --> 01:39:21.438
- <i>You do that for them?</i>
- Yeah.

01:39:22.806 --> 01:39:25.010
Okay. And this is where
we take all the portraits.

01:39:27.682 --> 01:39:29.118
Very official.

01:39:32.158 --> 01:39:34.128
<i>Okay. So, Mom, sit here.</i>

01:39:36.567 --> 01:39:39.437
Oh, no.
I didn't even set my hair.

01:39:39.439 --> 01:39:41.876
<i>No, that doesn't matter.
It's just for me.</i>

01:39:52.831 --> 01:39:54.769
And, Dad, you can sit here.

01:40:03.887 --> 01:40:05.357
Okay.

01:40:08.028 --> 01:40:10.299
Why don't I take a photo
of you and your dad instead?

01:40:11.569 --> 01:40:13.739
Because I want one
with all of us in it.

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:49.977
Ready?

01:40:53.686 --> 01:40:55.020
Okay, hold still.

01:40:56.758 --> 01:41:00.164
One, two, three.
