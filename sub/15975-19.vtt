01:04:29.502 --> 01:04:30.867
<i>Dana: This is idiotic!
Bert: Dana.</i>

01:04:30.937 --> 01:04:32.666
This is idiotic, and I'll
tell you what else --

01:04:32.739 --> 01:04:34.366
this is no way
to run a network!

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.807
-- Don't call me idiotic.
-- Bert...

01:04:36.876 --> 01:04:38.037
No, I'm a full-grown adult,
lady,

01:04:38.111 --> 01:04:39.408
and I've heard about you
at these meetings.

01:04:39.479 --> 01:04:42.881
I am not other people.
lam the network CFO.

01:04:42.949 --> 01:04:45.145
This is not slow-pitch softball,
Bert, it's the Olympics,

01:04:45.218 --> 01:04:46.913
and whatever you might think
of my decorum,

01:04:46.986 --> 01:04:48.886
what I'm doing right now
is my job!

01:04:48.955 --> 01:04:52.414
I understand, Dana, but unless you can point
to the tree upon which money is growing --

01:04:52.492 --> 01:04:53.516
This sucks.

01:04:53.593 --> 01:04:55.027
A casual observer
would never guess

01:04:55.094 --> 01:04:56.493
you were from
a good family, Dana.

01:04:56.562 --> 01:04:57.427
Hey, let's leave families
out of --

01:04:57.497 --> 01:04:59.090
This is happening
every week, Isaac.

01:04:59.165 --> 01:05:00.223
Not every week.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.233
Every damn week

01:05:01.301 --> 01:05:02.234
we're looking for change

01:05:02.302 --> 01:05:03.326
under sofa cushions!

01:05:03.403 --> 01:05:04.837
Meanwhile, Luther Sachs has just

01:05:04.904 --> 01:05:07.737
cashed a $740 million bonus!

01:05:07.807 --> 01:05:09.206
-- <i>Dana...</i>
-- <i>Newsweek says he's one</i>

01:05:09.275 --> 01:05:11.039
of the five highest-paid CEOs

01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:12.509
in the country,

01:05:12.578 --> 01:05:15.275
and you're still cutting back
on Olympic coverage?!

01:05:15.348 --> 01:05:16.782
-- Yes.
-- So I'm <i>asking</i> --

01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:18.442
-- what's going on?
-- We reviewed the budget.

01:05:18.518 --> 01:05:19.451
A budget that was approved

01:05:19.519 --> 01:05:20.452
eight months ago!

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.750
It went through
the normal review process

01:05:22.822 --> 01:05:23.948
at the network level

01:05:24.023 --> 01:05:26.117
and was sent up
to the corporate level.

01:05:26.192 --> 01:05:27.956
Oh, I like the sound
of this.

01:05:28.027 --> 01:05:31.053
<i>Dana, a budget that calls
for a 34-man team in Sydney</i>

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:32.256
is overly ambitious.

01:05:32.332 --> 01:05:33.925
Well, God forbid
we be ambitious!

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.094
Let's dial down
the volume a bit.

01:05:36.169 --> 01:05:37.500
<i>And, Ray, Bert,</i>

01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:41.165
I got to say that
cutting down from 34 to 12

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:44.005
is off-the-charts
ludicrous.

01:05:44.077 --> 01:05:47.843
<i>12 people is gonna look
like local news.</i>

01:05:47.914 --> 01:05:50.645
Isaac, CSC's gonna close
a deal with Austech.

01:05:50.717 --> 01:05:51.650
Austech?

01:05:51.718 --> 01:05:53.208
It's an Australian
carrier.

01:05:53.286 --> 01:05:55.846
-- What <i>kind of</i> deal? -- <i>Austech
shares production costs in Sydney</i>

01:05:55.922 --> 01:05:57.447
and supplies
supplementary manpower.

01:05:57.523 --> 01:05:59.787
-- What do we do?
-- Wraparound.

01:05:59.859 --> 01:06:01.520
-- Wraparound?
-- Yeah.

01:06:01.594 --> 01:06:03.153
<i>For a refreshing
change of pace?</i>

01:06:03.229 --> 01:06:05.323
That'll be exciting
for us.

01:06:05.398 --> 01:06:06.490
We're not here to keep you
interested, Dana.

01:06:06.566 --> 01:06:08.295
However, we do
keep you employed,

01:06:08.368 --> 01:06:11.565
so, as long as we do,
please watch your mouth.

01:06:12.772 --> 01:06:15.969
<i>Isaac: Bert, I'm more steamed
about this than Dana is,</i>

01:06:16.042 --> 01:06:17.567
<i>so bring it over here.</i>

01:06:17.643 --> 01:06:18.940
Isaac.

01:06:19.011 --> 01:06:21.946
<i>For instance, why are you
in this meeting?</i>

01:06:22.014 --> 01:06:23.607
I'm in it because
I'm in it, Isaac.

01:06:23.683 --> 01:06:26.118
Well, that answer is far from
satisfactory to me

01:06:26.185 --> 01:06:28.449
<i>'cause I think you'd agree
that it's unusual</i>

01:06:28.521 --> 01:06:31.320
that you'd play
a hands-on role in --

01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:34.793
Finance is going to be playing more
of a hands-on role in CSC operations.

01:06:34.861 --> 01:06:36.727
-- Well, that's good news,
-- Isaac.

01:06:36.796 --> 01:06:39.163
<i>'Cause it's the sensitive
hand of finance</i>

01:06:39.232 --> 01:06:42.133
that always leads
to prizewinning coverage.

01:06:42.201 --> 01:06:44.693
Your prizewinning coverage
is racking up deficits

01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:47.035
to the tune
of $120 million a year.

01:06:47.106 --> 01:06:48.574
You want to cut me a check,

01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:50.473
we can end all this
right here.

01:06:51.544 --> 01:06:52.978
How's it gonna work?

01:06:54.013 --> 01:06:56.948
Austech works out
of their studio in Melbourne.

01:06:57.016 --> 01:06:59.451
<i>They've got another facility
in Sydney.</i>

01:06:59.519 --> 01:07:01.453
They're hardwired
into your earpiece.

01:07:01.521 --> 01:07:04.821
<i>Can I ask why they need
any producers at all?</i>

01:07:04.891 --> 01:07:06.586
-- They don't.
-- <i>What?</i>

01:07:06.659 --> 01:07:08.218
Ray just said they don't.

01:07:08.294 --> 01:07:10.456
<i>If you look through the budget,
you'll see traveling staff</i>

01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:12.692
is limited to on-air
and support.

01:07:12.765 --> 01:07:15.325
-- Are you -- -- Dana, are you telling
me you'd produce better coverage

01:07:15.401 --> 01:07:17.096
if you were sitting in the back
of a truck in Sydney?

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:18.365
Yes, I'm telling you that.

01:07:18.438 --> 01:07:20.065
Sydney is where
the Olympics are.

01:07:20.139 --> 01:07:22.039
Folks, this is not
a town-hall meeting.

01:07:22.108 --> 01:07:23.542
I'm telling you
the way it is.

01:07:23.609 --> 01:07:24.576
Live with it,
don't live with it.

01:07:24.644 --> 01:07:26.874
Either way,
I've got a lunch.

01:07:26.946 --> 01:07:28.436
Nice to see you, Isaac.

01:07:28.514 --> 01:07:30.414
Yeah.

01:07:30.483 --> 01:07:31.917
It's gonna be great.

01:07:31.984 --> 01:07:34.043
You're gonna love
the footage from Austech.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:35.053
Get out.

01:07:35.121 --> 01:07:36.486
It's gonna be fine.

01:07:37.824 --> 01:07:39.155
[Sighs]

01:07:44.063 --> 01:07:45.292
Is there any chance

01:07:45.364 --> 01:07:47.992
they're just talking
about the Olympics?

01:07:48.067 --> 01:07:49.228
No.

01:07:49.302 --> 01:07:51.896
-- They're talking about production?
-- Yep.

01:07:51.971 --> 01:07:54.599
-- Promotion?
-- Yeah.

01:07:57.810 --> 01:07:59.608
So they're talking
about losing people.

01:07:59.679 --> 01:08:01.010
They're not <i>talking</i>
about it.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.570
Right.

01:08:02.648 --> 01:08:04.082
-- Do me a favor.
-- <i>What?</i>

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:05.311
Keep it to yourself.

01:08:07.053 --> 01:08:08.612
Yep.

01:08:08.688 --> 01:08:10.622
<i>[ Chuckles ]</i>

01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:12.920
That was funny
what you said before

01:08:12.992 --> 01:08:15.086
about the prizewinning
coverage.

01:08:15.161 --> 01:08:17.288
You do this job
for a lifetime,

01:08:17.363 --> 01:08:19.559
and you do get
a sense of humor.

01:08:19.631 --> 01:08:20.895
Yeah.

01:08:20.966 --> 01:08:22.401
Want a drink?

01:08:22.468 --> 01:08:23.697
It's noon.

01:08:23.769 --> 01:08:25.703
Austech.

01:08:36.015 --> 01:08:37.005
-- Hey.
-- Hey, Jeremy.

01:08:37.082 --> 01:08:37.743
I didn't know

01:08:37.817 --> 01:08:39.011
anyone was using the room.

01:08:39.085 --> 01:08:40.575
I'm just doing
the A.L. East.

01:08:40.653 --> 01:08:42.381
I can pick it up later
if you want.

01:08:42.455 --> 01:08:43.388
-- No.
-- You sure?

01:08:43.456 --> 01:08:45.254
Yeah.

01:08:45.323 --> 01:08:47.383
So, it's Passover.

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.087
Yeah, I know.
I'd have known anyway

01:08:49.161 --> 01:08:50.993
from being 28
and looking at a calendar,

01:08:51.063 --> 01:08:53.292
but my mother called me
this morning just in case.

01:08:53.366 --> 01:08:54.356
You doing anything?

01:08:54.433 --> 01:08:56.265
Well, we've got
the two shows.

01:08:56.335 --> 01:08:58.359
Yeah, well, I'm,
you know, just --

01:08:58.437 --> 01:08:59.563
What?

01:08:59.639 --> 01:09:01.663
I'm just, uh --
Elliot, Will, and I

01:09:01.741 --> 01:09:04.176
are doing a little something
between shows.

01:09:04.243 --> 01:09:05.210
A Seder?

01:09:05.278 --> 01:09:06.904
It's not gonna be a big deal.

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:08.310
We're just gonna break
some matzo, say a prayer.

01:09:08.381 --> 01:09:09.314
That's great.

01:09:09.381 --> 01:09:11.042
-- You want to come?
-- Yeah.

01:09:11.117 --> 01:09:13.415
-- It's not gonna be a big deal.
-- <i>Let's</i> make <i>it</i> a <i>big</i> deal.

01:09:13.486 --> 01:09:14.680
No, I want to keep it small.

01:09:14.754 --> 01:09:16.153
I don't want to make a lot
of noise about it.

01:09:16.221 --> 01:09:17.849
-- I understand -- quiet, understated.
-- Yeah.

01:09:17.924 --> 01:09:20.325
-- I'll go write the pageant.
-- The pageant?

01:09:20.393 --> 01:09:22.953
There are sections of the Haggadah that,
quite frankly, could use a polish.

01:09:23.029 --> 01:09:24.929
You're gonna do a rewrite
on the Haggadah?

01:09:24.997 --> 01:09:26.020
It's not written in stone,
Danny.

01:09:26.098 --> 01:09:27.259
Actually, some of it is.

01:09:27.332 --> 01:09:29.461
Now, I'll need a company
of players. Who's coming?

01:09:29.535 --> 01:09:31.799
Well, me, you, Elliot, Will
pretty much represent

01:09:31.871 --> 01:09:33.532
the Jewish population
around here.

01:09:33.606 --> 01:09:35.005
Let's throw open
our doors.

01:09:35.073 --> 01:09:36.734
-- You think?
-- Yeah. Passovefis about

01:09:36.809 --> 01:09:38.937
the telling of a great story
to those who've never heard it.

01:09:39.011 --> 01:09:42.037
Usually it's small children,
but, you know, gentiles will do.

01:09:42.113 --> 01:09:43.343
[Chuckles]

01:09:43.416 --> 01:09:45.180
All right, well,
ask whoever you want,

01:09:45.251 --> 01:09:47.015
but I don't think anybody's
gonna want to be there.

01:09:47.086 --> 01:09:49.487
-- Why not?
-- 'Cause I'm gonna be there.

01:09:49.555 --> 01:09:51.649
-- Dan, it wasn't that bad.
-- It was.

01:09:51.724 --> 01:09:53.783
-- <i>No, it wasn't.</i>
-- <i>You're not Casey.</i>

01:09:53.859 --> 01:09:56.521
Casey's gonna forgive you.
Everyone else already has.

01:09:56.596 --> 01:09:58.928
Anyway, between shows.
I took care of the food.

01:09:58.998 --> 01:10:01.592
Well, then all that's left is
for me to organize production.

01:10:01.667 --> 01:10:02.600
<i>Okay-</i>

01:10:02.668 --> 01:10:03.931
Ask Casey.

01:10:04.003 --> 01:10:04.970
Go away.

01:10:05.037 --> 01:10:06.471
-- Ask Casey.
-- Go away now.

01:10:06.539 --> 01:10:08.200
Okay.

01:10:18.985 --> 01:10:20.612
I would like to see
the following things --

01:10:20.686 --> 01:10:23.917
I would like to see our feed from
Toronto on any even-numbered monitor,

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:26.015
I would like to hear
a sound test at Shea,

01:10:26.092 --> 01:10:28.254
-- and I would like someone to
feel my forehead. Dave: Natalie --

01:10:28.327 --> 01:10:29.795
-- Elliot, feel my forehead.
-- Are you sick?

01:10:29.862 --> 01:10:31.261
She's not sick.

01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:33.128
-- Oh, I believe I'm coming
down with something. -- What?

01:10:33.199 --> 01:10:35.031
<i>Dave: Don't encourage her.
Will: The picture's up on four.</i>

01:10:35.101 --> 01:10:37.160
-- Will, <i>give me your</i> hand.
-- <i>I just ate</i> a <i>sticky bun.</i>

01:10:37.236 --> 01:10:38.761
Okay, then don't
give me your hand.

01:10:38.838 --> 01:10:40.533
You'll have to trust me.
I'm burning up.

01:10:40.606 --> 01:10:42.165
<i>Dave: Natalie.
-- <i>Olympic fever,</i> baby!</i>

01:10:42.241 --> 01:10:43.902
-- Oh, God.
-- Catch it!

01:10:43.976 --> 01:10:46.411
-- I thought there was something really
wrong with her. -- VVell, you be the judge.

01:10:46.479 --> 01:10:48.641
-- <i>Hey.</i> -- <i>I've got the fever, Jeremy.
I'm hot.</i>

01:10:48.714 --> 01:10:50.239
-- Yeah?
-- I cannot be stopped.

01:10:50.316 --> 01:10:51.249
Okay.

01:10:51.317 --> 01:10:53.081
Keep cobalt-Z
on a standby.

01:10:53.152 --> 01:10:54.381
Sound 10's
on a flat roll.

01:10:54.453 --> 01:10:55.545
What do you need?

01:10:55.621 --> 01:10:57.248
Dan and I are making a Seder
between the shows.

01:10:57.323 --> 01:10:58.586
-- Will and I are already there.
-- Yeah.

01:10:58.658 --> 01:11:00.922
-- And the rest of you are invited, too.
-- I'm not Jewish.

01:11:00.993 --> 01:11:02.722
Yeah, I dated you
for a year and a half.

01:11:02.795 --> 01:11:04.126
Right up until the day
I broke up with you.

01:11:04.196 --> 01:11:06.460
An event that occurred just moments
after I broke up with you,

01:11:06.532 --> 01:11:08.626
but it's Passover,
and I digress.

01:11:08.701 --> 01:11:10.294
That's pretty unusual
for you.

01:11:10.369 --> 01:11:12.736
<i>Hey, just the kind of festive
wit I'm looking for.</i>

01:11:12.805 --> 01:11:14.068
This is a universal Seder,

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.040
and you'll be playing
evil Pharaoh.

01:11:16.108 --> 01:11:17.007
-- Thanks.
-- You <i>bet.</i>

01:11:17.076 --> 01:11:18.168
-- We're playing roles?
-- <i>Jeremy:</i> Yeah.

01:11:18.244 --> 01:11:19.177
Like in a play?

01:11:19.245 --> 01:11:21.407
-- Exactly like that, Will.
-- Cool!

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.073
Let me tell you something,
Erickson can pitch.

01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:24.776
Yep. Who am I playing?

01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:27.842
You're playing Pharaoh's
assistant Maggie.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.514
-- There's someone named Maggie
in the Haggadah? -- There <i>is</i> now.

01:11:30.589 --> 01:11:31.579
All right,
I'm locking the Chyron.

01:11:31.657 --> 01:11:33.557
<i>Olympic fever,
mi muchacho!</i>

01:11:33.626 --> 01:11:36.618
-- Oh, man, she's doing it in Spanish now.
-- Give me sound.

01:11:36.696 --> 01:11:38.027
EXCUSE me, everyone.

01:11:38.097 --> 01:11:40.759
Cut footage for the 50s
in a half-hour.

01:11:40.833 --> 01:11:42.665
-- Dana.
-- Yeah.

01:11:42.735 --> 01:11:44.965
-- Hey.
-- Hey, what?

01:11:45.037 --> 01:11:47.165
-- N-Nothing.
-- Okay.

01:11:47.239 --> 01:11:48.502
-- So listen...
-- Yeah.

01:11:48.574 --> 01:11:50.269
There's this video store
on my corner --

01:11:50.342 --> 01:11:51.832
now, it's not a chain
or anything.

01:11:51.911 --> 01:11:53.777
-- It's just the one store.
-- Hurry up with this.

01:11:53.846 --> 01:11:55.746
I don't feel I have
your undivided attention.

01:11:55.815 --> 01:11:57.214
You don't.

01:11:57.283 --> 01:11:58.307
Okay.

01:11:58.384 --> 01:12:00.546
So, I go into this place
from time to time.

01:12:00.619 --> 01:12:01.677
<i>To rem Caddyshack?</i>

01:12:01.754 --> 01:12:03.313
<i>Or La Dolce Vita, yeah.</i>

01:12:03.389 --> 01:12:06.620
Anyway, the guy wants me
to do a "10 favorites" list

01:12:06.692 --> 01:12:08.285
so he can put it up on
the wall next to my picture.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.522
You're having trouble
coming up with 10 movies?

01:12:10.596 --> 01:12:12.530
-- No.
-- Then what's the problem?

01:12:12.598 --> 01:12:13.997
I don't want to do this.

01:12:14.066 --> 01:12:15.158
Then don't.

01:12:15.234 --> 01:12:17.601
I mean, I <i>really</i> don't want
to do this.

01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:18.728
Then don't.

01:12:18.804 --> 01:12:20.932
It's not like I'm being
a snob or anything.

01:12:21.006 --> 01:12:22.531
It's just --
I have a career,

01:12:22.608 --> 01:12:25.134
and I can't have my picture
up there next to the guy

01:12:25.211 --> 01:12:27.407
who just opened for Carrot Top
at Carolines.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.175
Don't do it.

01:12:29.248 --> 01:12:31.046
I just don't know
what to say to the guy.

01:12:31.117 --> 01:12:32.778
Tell him
you won't do it.

01:12:32.852 --> 01:12:34.217
I'll sound
like a jackass.

01:12:34.286 --> 01:12:35.378
You are a jackass.

01:12:35.454 --> 01:12:36.387
You think I should do it?

01:12:36.455 --> 01:12:39.390
I honestly don't care,
Casey.

01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:41.893
I would give <i>all</i> I had
at this moment

01:12:41.961 --> 01:12:44.191
for my biggest problem
to be your ego.

01:12:44.263 --> 01:12:45.788
That was a little harsh.

01:12:47.366 --> 01:12:48.561
Do me a favor.

01:12:48.634 --> 01:12:50.432
Go make up with Dan,
would you?

01:12:50.503 --> 01:12:51.595
Hey, leave me alone.

01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:52.831
-- Casey...
-- No, I'm serious, Dana.

01:12:52.905 --> 01:12:56.136
-- Leave that be.
-- Okay.

01:12:57.943 --> 01:12:59.911
If I did do the list,
it'd be a damn good list,

01:12:59.979 --> 01:13:01.504
I can tell you that much
right now.

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:04.311
-- <i>How many Rocky movies?</i>
-- <i>"I" through "III."</i>

01:13:04.383 --> 01:13:06.818
-- [ Laughs ] Not IV and <i>V?</i>
-- Don't <i>be</i> ridiculous, Dana.

01:13:06.886 --> 01:13:09.321
This is the 10 best movies
of all time.

01:13:09.388 --> 01:13:10.219
Ah.

01:13:10.289 --> 01:13:11.313
[Snaps fingers]
See ya.

01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:12.380
<i>Okay-</i>

01:13:14.794 --> 01:13:15.727
[Sighs]

01:13:15.795 --> 01:13:16.728
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

01:13:16.796 --> 01:13:18.491
I did most
of the A.L. East,

01:13:18.564 --> 01:13:20.328
but I'm gonna
come back to it.

01:13:20.399 --> 01:13:22.163
-- After the stuff at 4:00?
-- Yeah.

01:13:22.234 --> 01:13:23.724
Okay,
I'll keep it open.

01:13:23.803 --> 01:13:26.636
Yeah. Good. I'm also gonna get
some more film on Erickson.

01:13:26.705 --> 01:13:28.503
-- They're sending it to me...
-- On the satellite.

01:13:28.574 --> 01:13:29.837
-- Yeah.
-- Okay.

01:13:29.909 --> 01:13:30.842
Casey...

01:13:34.446 --> 01:13:36.437
Believe it or not, um,
Jeremy and I

01:13:36.515 --> 01:13:39.348
are having a little Passover
Seder in between shows.

01:13:39.418 --> 01:13:40.681
I don't know, actually,

01:13:40.753 --> 01:13:42.721
I thought it might be
kind of fun.

01:13:42.788 --> 01:13:45.348
We never have had
a Seder together, me and you.

01:13:45.424 --> 01:13:46.983
Yeah.

01:13:47.059 --> 01:13:48.618
Yeah.

01:13:48.694 --> 01:13:50.662
Yeah, I've never been
to a Seder at all.

01:13:50.729 --> 01:13:51.924
Yeah, well, this one's

01:13:51.997 --> 01:13:54.398
not gonna start a stampede
of conversions or anything.

01:13:54.466 --> 01:13:58.960
[Chuckles] But, uh, it might
be nice if you want to come.

01:13:59.038 --> 01:14:01.370
No, I don't --
I don't think so, Danny.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.430
Oh, just asking.

01:14:02.508 --> 01:14:04.272
Yeah,
I gotta do this stuff.

01:14:04.343 --> 01:14:05.435
Yeah.

01:14:05.511 --> 01:14:07.445
I'm saving 2:20
for the A.L. East.

01:14:07.513 --> 01:14:09.242
Good. Thanks.

01:14:13.686 --> 01:14:16.121
<i>Dan: Manager Johnny Wilson
was upbeat</i>

01:14:16.188 --> 01:14:17.622
after the announcement,
declaring,

01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:19.624
"This is great.
This is great.

01:14:19.692 --> 01:14:21.660
"This is how
you win championships.

01:14:21.727 --> 01:14:23.252
This is just so great."

01:14:23.329 --> 01:14:26.299
Close your eyes. It's just
like sitting by Walden Pond.

01:14:26.365 --> 01:14:27.924
Indeed. We're gonna
pay some bills

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.468
and come back
in just a minute.

01:14:29.535 --> 01:14:32.095
I'm Casey, he's Dan.

01:14:32.171 --> 01:14:33.798
-- Don't go <i>away.</i>
-- We're out.

01:14:33.873 --> 01:14:35.034
Three minutes back.

01:14:35.107 --> 01:14:37.166
Let me tell you something,
I'm feelin' a little woozy.

01:14:37.243 --> 01:14:38.711
-- Yeah?
-- Why do you --

01:14:38.777 --> 01:14:39.938
I'm feelin'
a little lightheaded,

01:14:40.012 --> 01:14:42.709
-- a little woozy. -- Let's
see Nashville on ready-1.

01:14:42.781 --> 01:14:45.842

tell me, please, what be ailin' me?

a second.

2:30 back.

01:14:51.323 --> 01:14:52.313
What's up?

01:14:52.391 --> 01:14:53.517
No, nothing.

01:14:53.592 --> 01:14:56.960
I was just --
I keep meaning to ask you.

01:14:57.029 --> 01:14:59.054
Do you know Rick Rogers
at Prime Sports?

01:14:59.131 --> 01:15:01.031
I don't know him. We've probably
shaken hands at some point.

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.296
-- You should call him.
-- Why?

01:15:03.369 --> 01:15:04.632
No, nothing.

01:15:04.703 --> 01:15:07.001
I keep meaning to tell you
over the past few days,

01:15:07.072 --> 01:15:08.506
there've --

01:15:08.574 --> 01:15:10.565
there's a senior producer
leaving.

01:15:10.643 --> 01:15:12.407
Are they looking for me
to recommend someone?

01:15:12.478 --> 01:15:13.411
No.

01:15:13.479 --> 01:15:15.174
'Cause Kim's ready.
She can do that job.

01:15:15.247 --> 01:15:17.045
No, I just wanted
to mention it 'cause --

01:15:17.116 --> 01:15:18.743
How was the budget meeting
this morning?

01:15:18.817 --> 01:15:20.410
It wasn't good.

01:15:20.486 --> 01:15:21.681
Cutbacks?

01:15:21.754 --> 01:15:22.846
Yeah.

01:15:22.922 --> 01:15:24.287
What?

01:15:24.356 --> 01:15:25.790
Olympic coverage.

01:15:27.526 --> 01:15:29.620
I know.
I wanted that for you.

01:15:32.998 --> 01:15:34.466
What about people?

01:15:34.533 --> 01:15:36.297
I think we're gonna lose
some people.

01:15:38.037 --> 01:15:39.869
Kim and Elliot
are very employable.

01:15:39.939 --> 01:15:41.668
-- Yeah.
-- Don't worry about it.

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:42.901
I am worried about it.

01:15:42.975 --> 01:15:44.204
-- Don't be today.
-- Why?

01:15:44.276 --> 01:15:46.711
I don't know.
It's Passover.

01:15:48.113 --> 01:15:49.376
Okay.

01:17:34.019 --> 01:17:35.453
It's no big deal.

01:17:35.521 --> 01:17:37.319
See ya later.

01:17:38.424 --> 01:17:41.860
[indistinct voices]

01:17:54.706 --> 01:17:55.969
So.

01:17:56.041 --> 01:17:57.839
Yes.

01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:59.969
I was sorry to hear that you
and Joanie split up.

01:18:00.045 --> 01:18:02.776
Jenny. It wasn't Joanie.
It was Jenny.

01:18:02.848 --> 01:18:05.613
-- If you don't mind me saying so
-- -- Not much chance of that.

01:18:05.684 --> 01:18:08.176
I think she was good for the boy
in you, but not the man in you.

01:18:08.253 --> 01:18:10.779
-- Really?
-- A choreo-animator?

01:18:10.856 --> 01:18:12.756
That's like dating
Mary Poppins

01:18:12.825 --> 01:18:14.987
or your junior-high-school
librarian.

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:16.619
-- Natalie.
-- Am I out of line?

01:18:16.695 --> 01:18:20.188
-- No, except she wasn't a choreo-animator.
-- What was she?

01:18:20.265 --> 01:18:21.926
A porn star.

01:18:24.536 --> 01:18:25.833
Really?

01:18:25.904 --> 01:18:27.838
She's made
over 80 adult films.

01:18:27.906 --> 01:18:30.967
She's slept with, if possible,
more men than you have.

01:18:31.043 --> 01:18:32.477
Jenny was a porn star

01:18:32.544 --> 01:18:34.774
for both the boy
and the man in me.

01:18:34.847 --> 01:18:35.837
Ah.

01:18:35.914 --> 01:18:37.040
Yes.

01:18:38.784 --> 01:18:40.047
Hey.

01:18:40.119 --> 01:18:41.917
-- Hello.
-- You got a second?

01:18:41.987 --> 01:18:43.045
I believe I do, yes.

01:18:43.122 --> 01:18:44.988
Not quite finished
with your scene yet, Dana.

01:18:45.057 --> 01:18:47.116
-- VVell, hurry up. I'm all aflutter.
-- <i>Okay.</i>

01:18:47.192 --> 01:18:48.216
I'll stay right here.

01:18:48.293 --> 01:18:51.228
And the problem is
I'm already on page 9

01:18:51.296 --> 01:18:53.560
and I haven't introduced
Moses yet.

01:18:53.632 --> 01:18:56.567
That's problematic if you're
telling the story of Exodus,

01:18:56.635 --> 01:18:58.831
yet it's an epic tale,

01:18:58.904 --> 01:19:00.838
so maybe
it isn't problematic,

01:19:00.906 --> 01:19:03.341
nor is it problematic
that I'm talking to myself,

01:19:03.408 --> 01:19:05.740
for that
is the creative process.

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:10.881
All right, stop now.

01:19:10.949 --> 01:19:12.974
-- <i>A porn star?</i>
-- <i>Yes.</i>

01:19:13.051 --> 01:19:14.985
-- A <i>porn</i> star?
-- Yes.

01:19:15.053 --> 01:19:17.522
He broke up with me 'cause
I wanted to <i>do</i> too much.

01:19:17.589 --> 01:19:19.250
I wanted
to have too much fun.

01:19:19.324 --> 01:19:22.123
So, logically, his next
girlfriend would be a porn star.

01:19:22.194 --> 01:19:25.255
I was not entirely
forthcoming before.

01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:26.593
When?

01:19:26.665 --> 01:19:27.962
When I talked to you
before

01:19:28.033 --> 01:19:29.660
about Rick Rogers
and Prime Sports.

01:19:29.735 --> 01:19:31.169
W-What do you mean?

01:19:31.236 --> 01:19:33.796
In the next few months, there are
going to be massive rollbacks.

01:19:33.872 --> 01:19:36.773
You think Kim and Elliot
are in danger?

01:19:36.842 --> 01:19:38.435
-- No.
-- Jeremy?

01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:40.410
-- Natalie... -- Don't ever
misunderstand me, Dana.

01:19:40.479 --> 01:19:41.913
I hate
Jeremy's breathing guts,

01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.914
but I love him like
I've never loved anyone,

01:19:43.982 --> 01:19:45.472
<i>plus which,
I honestly don't think</i>

01:19:45.551 --> 01:19:47.349
-- <i>we can do the show without him.</i>
-- I <i>know.</i>

01:19:47.419 --> 01:19:49.251
<i>My point is that
if anyone's job</i>

01:19:49.321 --> 01:19:51.153
<i>is worth fighting for,
it's</i> --

01:19:55.827 --> 01:19:57.420
Oh, God.

01:19:57.496 --> 01:19:59.794
-- Natalie...
-- They want to fire me.

01:19:59.865 --> 01:20:02.232
All it is
is an instinct right now.

01:20:02.301 --> 01:20:03.826
Yeah.

01:20:03.902 --> 01:20:05.996
A senior associate's
a luxury position.

01:20:06.071 --> 01:20:08.665

CNN/SI.

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:11.766
Yeah...

01:20:11.843 --> 01:20:13.937
Yeah, okay.

01:20:14.012 --> 01:20:14.843
Okay?

01:20:14.913 --> 01:20:15.971
Yeah.

01:20:18.183 --> 01:20:19.617
So...

01:20:19.685 --> 01:20:22.620
maybe you want to call
Rick Rogers at Prime Sports.

01:20:22.688 --> 01:20:24.087
-- Nah.
-- Natalie...

01:20:24.156 --> 01:20:25.715
-- I'll wait.
-- Okay.

01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:27.725
I'll wait
and see what happens.

01:20:27.793 --> 01:20:28.988
That's fine, but --

01:20:29.061 --> 01:20:30.426
I'm gonna go check out
some cut footage.

01:20:30.495 --> 01:20:31.587
Okay.

01:20:31.663 --> 01:20:33.757

I can't work like this.

01:20:45.143 --> 01:20:46.702
-- Natalie!
Natalie." Yeah.

01:20:46.778 --> 01:20:48.610
-- You're on.
-- Can I talk to you outside?

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:49.670
-- That's happening a lot today.
-- Out there.

01:20:49.748 --> 01:20:52.012
Somebody find me my Moses.
It's almost time.

01:20:52.084 --> 01:20:53.609
It's almost time?

01:20:53.685 --> 01:20:55.585
VVell, we've got another 500 or 600
years, but we're getting there.

01:20:55.654 --> 01:20:57.622
-- Hey.
-- Yeah.

01:21:00.259 --> 01:21:02.250
A porn star?

01:21:02.327 --> 01:21:04.728
-- Yes.
-- You slept with a porn star?

01:21:04.796 --> 01:21:07.026
It never actually
got that far.

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.330
You dated a porn star
and never slept with her?

01:21:10.402 --> 01:21:11.335
Yeah.

01:21:11.403 --> 01:21:12.564
What a goober.

01:21:12.638 --> 01:21:13.935
Thanks.

01:21:14.006 --> 01:21:15.098
Natalie?

01:21:15.173 --> 01:21:16.163
Yeah?

01:21:16.241 --> 01:21:17.640
You okay?

01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:18.699
Yeah.

01:21:18.777 --> 01:21:20.108
It looked
for a second like --

01:21:20.178 --> 01:21:21.839
Dana thinks there's gonna be
some rollbacks.

01:21:21.913 --> 01:21:24.780
-- Does she think it's gonna be you?
-- Yeah.

01:21:24.850 --> 01:21:27.217
Dana's not gonna
let it happen, Natalie.

01:21:27.286 --> 01:21:29.721
-- Jeremy... -- Dana's
not gonna let it happen,

01:21:29.788 --> 01:21:31.483
and neither will I.

01:21:34.326 --> 01:21:36.021
I miss you.

01:21:37.829 --> 01:21:39.763
Okay.

01:21:39.831 --> 01:21:42.095
Let's go back inside.

Ah, Moses.

Right there's good.

01:22:00.719 --> 01:22:04.178
I was hoping --
if no one minded --

01:22:04.256 --> 01:22:08.454
I was hoping on saying
a few words before we started.

01:22:08.527 --> 01:22:10.552
I know I've spoken
to you all individually,

01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:12.859
<i>but it's worth saying
out loud on this occasion</i>

01:22:12.931 --> 01:22:15.593
<i>that my behavior last week,</i>

01:22:15.667 --> 01:22:19.103
both on and off the air,
was regrettable.

01:22:19.171 --> 01:22:21.469
<i>I appreciate
those who have forgiven me,</i>

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.565
and I understand those
who haven't yet.

01:22:23.642 --> 01:22:26.509

these are fractious times</i> --

professionally, personally,
socially.

01:22:29.948 --> 01:22:32.110
I'd suspect in the next
few days, we're gonna hear

01:22:32.184 --> 01:22:34.619
that our Olympic budget
has been cut back dramatically

01:22:34.686 --> 01:22:38.281
<i>and that
there might be other cutbacks</i>

01:22:38.357 --> 01:22:40.189
that could be far worse.

01:22:41.426 --> 01:22:43.690
<i>It seems to me
that more and more</i>

01:22:43.762 --> 01:22:46.322
we've come to expect
<i>less</i> and <i>less</i> from each other,

01:22:46.398 --> 01:22:48.696
and I'd like to be first
to start bucking that trend.

01:22:50.135 --> 01:22:52.365
We need each other badly.

01:22:52.437 --> 01:22:53.871

at my video store.

01:23:20.966 --> 01:23:22.764

What?
