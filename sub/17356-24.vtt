WEBVTT

00:07.274 --> 00:09.308
- ¶

00:09.310 --> 00:11.310
- What's the emergency?
Did King Crab escape?

00:11.312 --> 00:13.145
Did Dark Mayhem escape?
Who escaped?

00:13.147 --> 00:16.448
- Nobody. We need your money
so we can buy cookies.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.383
- Oh...

00:17.385 --> 00:18.884
well, it's a good
thing I left

00:18.886 --> 00:20.419
in the middle of
getting my cavity filled!

00:20.421 --> 00:23.355
- Sweet Gam Gam Cookies
is holding a contest.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.857
- Oh, I love
Sweet Gam Gam.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.258
Her peanut butter-
fudge cookies

00:26.260 --> 00:28.193
are the reason
I have that cavity.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.094
- If you find
the winning box,

00:29.096 --> 00:31.530
you get to visit
Sweet Gam Gam's Cookie Palace.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.298
- Yeah, she invented
a microchip cookie

00:33.300 --> 00:35.434
that can be programmed
with any flavor.

00:35.436 --> 00:36.301
- We can finally taste

00:36.303 --> 00:39.304
the Billy Thunderman Super
Chocolate Chunk Surprise.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.140
- What's the surprise?

00:41.142 --> 00:41.974
- Cat food!

00:41.976 --> 00:43.575
- Billy, I don't
think you should be

00:43.577 --> 00:45.477
at the helm
of this ship.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.945
Oh, one box, please?

00:46.947 --> 00:49.415
- One box? Pffft!
You'll never win.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.618
- [confetti explodes]
- [musical fanfare]

00:52.620 --> 00:53.886
- Ha! I won!

00:53.888 --> 00:56.455
"Congratulations on winning
Sweet Gam Gam's Cookie Contest.

00:56.457 --> 00:59.091
I look forward
to sweeting you."

00:59.093 --> 00:59.925
[laughing]

00:59.927 --> 01:02.928
She said "sweeting"
instead of "meeting."

01:02.930 --> 01:04.163
- You're the worst,
Phoebe.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.597
- Oh, I get to take
someone with me.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.199
- You're still
the worst, Phoebe.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.334
But please take
me with you.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.936
- ¶

01:10.938 --> 01:11.937
- The kids should
be home soon.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.173
- I wonder if one of them
won that cookie contest?

01:14.175 --> 01:16.075
- I'm the only choice!
- Take me!

01:16.077 --> 01:18.110
- Take me to
the Cookie Palace!

01:18.112 --> 01:20.045
- Take me with you!

01:20.047 --> 01:20.546
- Stop!

01:20.548 --> 01:24.316
I will pick one of you.
Just give me a second.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.986
- You heard her.
Give her some time.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.321
Time's up!

01:29.323 --> 01:31.490
- I'm the one going!
- Take me!

01:31.492 --> 01:33.492
- Take me to
the Cookie Palace!

01:33.494 --> 01:36.261
- Every day
with those four.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.630
- [gasps]
Barb, look at this!

01:38.632 --> 01:41.967
The Little Mini Metroburg
Pageant is coming up.

01:41.969 --> 01:44.203
- Oh, Hank,
I'm flattered.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.638
But I'm not exactly
pageant ready.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.174
- Not you. Chloe.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.175
- What's a pageant?

01:50.177 --> 01:52.578
- Well, it's a little contest
to see who the cutest,

01:52.580 --> 01:54.947
most talented
superkid is.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.683
- Little contest?
[chuckling]

01:57.685 --> 01:59.118
Maybe for a simple
farm girl.

01:59.120 --> 02:03.622
But for this stylish
city boy, it was everything.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.125
- Next up,
ready to dazzle us

02:06.127 --> 02:08.494
with a flying
ribbon routine,

02:08.496 --> 02:10.395
Little Hank Thunderman!

02:10.397 --> 02:12.664
- AUDIENCE:
[applauding]

02:12.666 --> 02:14.466
- [pageant music playing]

02:14.468 --> 02:17.536
- BIG HANK: Everything
started out great.

02:17.538 --> 02:23.976
- ¶

02:23.978 --> 02:26.211
- AUDIENCE:
[gasping]

02:26.213 --> 02:32.017
- ¶

02:32.019 --> 02:34.253
- BIG HANK: My ribbon
routine was hot--

02:34.255 --> 02:37.389
maybe a little
too hot.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.361
- Fire! Fire!

02:42.363 --> 02:46.632
All these superheroes and
nobody has water powers?

02:47.034 --> 02:49.401
- Everyone made it
out alive that day--

02:49.403 --> 02:52.738
except my dreams
of pageant glory.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.306
- Your father
never competed

02:54.308 --> 02:57.576
or shook what his
mama gave him again.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.479
- I couldn't.
They banned me.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.581
But they
didn't ban you!

03:02.583 --> 03:03.549
- I'm in, Daddy!

03:03.551 --> 03:06.385
- Oh, this will be great
for you two to do together.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.520
Hey, let's go change,
so we can get started.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.423
- [chuckling] Oh, this
is gonna be so much fun!

03:11.425 --> 03:13.392
- LITTLE HANK:
Not for fun, Hank.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.326
It's war.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.395
- We're gonna do this
for you, Little Hank.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.463
- I know you will,
Big Hank.

03:18.465 --> 03:21.767
Also, your fly is down.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.202
Gotcha!

03:23.204 --> 03:26.138
- BOTH:
Yo, ho, ho!

03:26.140 --> 03:31.243
- ¶

03:35.115 --> 03:35.847
- What are you doin'?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.382
- Ah, just practicing
my surprise face

03:37.384 --> 03:38.817
for when Phoebe
chooses me.

03:38.819 --> 03:42.487
Should I go with the, oh,
I'm so honored to win.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.289
Oh, my gosh!

03:44.291 --> 03:45.591
Or the...

03:45.593 --> 03:49.328
Ha! Yes! In your faces!

03:49.330 --> 03:50.495
- Hey, guys.

03:50.497 --> 03:54.466
- My twin!
How are ya, dear?

03:54.468 --> 03:56.568
- Freaked out.
Anyway...

03:56.570 --> 03:58.503
after some careful
consideration,

03:58.505 --> 04:02.341
I have decided that each
of you should convince me

04:02.343 --> 04:03.141
why I should take you.

04:03.143 --> 04:07.079
- Oh! Oh! I'd like to
throw my hat in the ring.

04:09.116 --> 04:09.848
- Get lost.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.350
- [banana zooming]

04:11.352 --> 04:12.251
- Missed me!

04:12.253 --> 04:14.553
- [banana thuds]
- Ow!

04:14.555 --> 04:17.723
The old second
banana trick.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.259
- All right, Max,
you start.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.527
Why should you get to try
the microchip cookie?

04:22.529 --> 04:23.795
- Because if you
don't choose me,

04:23.797 --> 04:26.098
I'll release that
picture I have of you

04:26.100 --> 04:28.333
picking at your
supersuit wedgie.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.534
- You don't have
a picture like that.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.404
- Or do I? Pick me like
you picked that wedgie.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.872
- I did not!

04:33.874 --> 04:36.375
All right. Now, Nora.
Why should I pick you?

04:36.377 --> 04:38.677
- We're sisters, which
automatically puts me

04:38.679 --> 04:40.779
ahead of these dingdongs.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.514
But if you choose
one of them,

04:42.516 --> 04:44.249
I'll laser off
your left eyebrow.

04:44.251 --> 04:47.419
- Oh, no, that's
the good one.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.221
- For now.

04:50.557 --> 04:51.823
- Yikes!

04:51.825 --> 04:54.359
Okay, Billy,
what about you?

04:54.361 --> 04:56.194
- Look, Sweet Gam Gam
is my heroine.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.796
I'd love to try
that microchip cookie,

04:57.798 --> 05:00.565
but I can't compete
with Max and Nora.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.566
- What are you
talking about?

05:01.568 --> 05:02.668
- Well, Max is
your twin brother,

05:02.670 --> 05:05.704
and Nora is your sister
from another mister.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.840
- Actually, we're
from the same mister.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.710
- What I'm trying to say is
you and I don't really hang out.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.446
So, you should probably
take one of them.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.380
- Wow, Billy,

05:15.382 --> 05:17.282
that's absolutely true.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.917
Okay, Phoebe,
who's it gonna be?

05:18.919 --> 05:21.353
Me or Nora?
- Ohhhh...

05:21.355 --> 05:23.588
It's a lot
to think about.

05:23.590 --> 05:24.523
Um...

05:24.525 --> 05:27.859
I've decided
I'm taking...

05:27.861 --> 05:31.563
Billy!
- MAX & NORA: What?!

05:32.599 --> 05:34.166
- COLOSSO:
Gotcha!

05:34.168 --> 05:37.469
Could I have
my hats back, please?

05:38.872 --> 05:41.406
- ¶

05:41.408 --> 05:42.441
¶ What you see ¶

05:42.443 --> 05:43.675
¶ Is not what you get ¶

05:43.677 --> 05:47.346
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

05:47.348 --> 05:48.847
¶ We fit right in ¶

05:48.849 --> 05:50.248
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

05:50.250 --> 05:51.817
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

05:51.819 --> 05:53.485
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

05:53.487 --> 05:55.420
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

05:55.422 --> 05:57.322
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

05:57.324 --> 05:58.724
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

05:58.726 --> 06:00.359
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

06:00.361 --> 06:02.227
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

06:02.229 --> 06:03.662
¶ It's our reality ¶

06:03.664 --> 06:04.763
¶ Just your average family ¶

06:04.765 --> 06:08.400
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

06:08.402 --> 06:12.604
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

06:14.775 --> 06:16.608
- ¶

06:16.610 --> 06:17.976
- Wow, you're really
choosing me?

06:17.978 --> 06:20.879
- Yeah, you're
really choosing him?

06:21.915 --> 06:23.248
- Hat attack!

06:23.250 --> 06:25.584
[chuckling]

06:25.586 --> 06:26.385
- What a day!

06:26.387 --> 06:27.753
I'm going to
Sweet Gam Gam's

06:27.755 --> 06:30.689
and I caught a hat
with my face.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.527
- I warned you, Phoebe.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.629
Now I'm releasing
that wedgie picture.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.931
- Okay, there is
no picture...

06:39.933 --> 06:42.801
because a lady
never picks.

06:42.803 --> 06:43.769
- They don't?

06:43.771 --> 06:46.271
I mean, everybody
knows that.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.973
- Billy's right.
We don't hang out enough.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.776
This is a great time
to bond with my little bro.

06:50.778 --> 06:51.877
- Sorry, I missed that.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.279
I was too busy
barfing in my mouth.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.415
- All right, you two need
to let this go.

06:56.417 --> 06:59.317
I'm taking Billy
and that's tough cookies.

06:59.319 --> 06:59.985
[laughing]

06:59.987 --> 07:03.488
I made my point
and I said "cookies."

07:03.924 --> 07:04.956
- I can't believe this.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.826
You know, if Phoebe and Billy
are gonna hang out,

07:07.828 --> 07:09.428
we should hang out, too.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.730
- P-p-p-pass!
[laughs]

07:11.732 --> 07:12.898
- Come on, Max.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.965
How else are we
gonna break into

07:13.967 --> 07:16.601
Sweet Gam Gam's Cookie Palace
to eat that microchip cookie?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.837
- Nora, I'm a candidate
for the Z-Force.

07:18.839 --> 07:19.571
I can't do that.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.705
- I get that you're
not evil, anymore,

07:20.707 --> 07:23.408
but you don't have to
be all "Phoebe" about it.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.377
- Wha-wha-what?

07:25.379 --> 07:27.679
- Never mind.
You're probably right.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.714
We should let them
eat our cookie

07:29.716 --> 07:30.982
while you go do ballet.

07:30.984 --> 07:31.817
- Phoebe takes ballet.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.653
- Oh, sorry, I get you
two confused lately.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.989
- Oh! That's it!
We're gettin' that cookie.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.524
And I am nothing
like Phoebe.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.327
- You're twins.
- Nothing!

07:42.329 --> 07:46.565
- ¶

07:46.567 --> 07:48.834
- Okay, Chloe, we've
got until tomorrow

07:48.836 --> 07:50.001
to get you ready
for the pageant.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.537
Let's work on
your thunder wave.

07:52.539 --> 07:54.739
Spin the lightbulb,

07:54.741 --> 07:55.841
wipe the window,

07:55.843 --> 07:58.343
and face.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.879
- I've been waving
all wrong.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.615
- You sure have, honey.
But Daddy's gonna fix it.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.517
Now, first, we've
gotta figure out

08:05.519 --> 08:07.486
what talent you
wanna showcase.

08:07.488 --> 08:10.789
- How about my
tele-handsprings?

08:10.791 --> 08:12.491
[whooshing]

08:12.493 --> 08:13.391
[whooshing]
Ta-da!

08:13.393 --> 08:17.496
- Oh, it's like you inherited
my looks and my talent.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.730
Oh. Now, for you
to win this thing,

08:18.732 --> 08:21.766
you have to be able to answer
questions under pressure.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.502
- What if I don't
know what to say?

08:23.504 --> 08:28.006
- Easy. The answer
is always "world peace."

08:28.008 --> 08:29.374
Now crowds eat that up.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.476
Now, I'm gonna spin you
to simulate how nervous

08:31.478 --> 08:34.045
and disoriented you'll
be on stage. Ready?

08:34.047 --> 08:36.982
Bah, bah, bah, bah,
bah, bah, bah, up!

08:36.984 --> 08:40.519
Young lady, what do you
wanna be when you grow up?

08:40.521 --> 08:42.487
- World peace?

08:42.489 --> 08:44.856
[tiny thud]
- [gasps]

08:44.858 --> 08:48.460
Very good, Chloe.
You didn't land on your face.

08:48.462 --> 08:52.497
- Daddy, pageants are
a lot of work.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.532
- It'll all be worth it

08:53.534 --> 08:56.735
when they hand
that trophy to me.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.638
- Don't you mean me?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.072
- Uh...

09:09.816 --> 09:11.917
- Welcome to
the Cookie Palace.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.986
Sweet Gam Gam will
be with you soon.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.788
- Thanks again for
choosing me, Phoebe.

09:16.790 --> 09:20.025
I thought you were gonna
bring your boyfriend Link.

09:20.027 --> 09:23.695
- Wow, we really
don't hang out.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.398
- MAN ANNOUNCING:
And now, introducing

09:26.400 --> 09:27.966
the Countess of Cookies,

09:27.968 --> 09:30.702
the Duchess
of Deliciousness,

09:30.704 --> 09:33.104
Sweet Gam Gam!

09:33.106 --> 09:37.075
- Sweet Gam Gam,
in the house!

09:38.946 --> 09:40.078
- It's really you.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.680
I've eaten so many
of your cookies,

09:41.682 --> 09:43.815
I feel like
we know each other.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.717
- Oh, we do.

09:45.719 --> 09:46.618
Just kidding.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.688
I've never seen you
before in my life.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.425
- Sweet Gam Gam,
your Cookie Palace is amazing.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.460
I love all of
these inventions.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.462
- The milk and cookies
t-shirt.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.830
I wanna wear it.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.566
- I wanna eat it.

10:01.568 --> 10:04.536
- And this is my
shrink wrap ray.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.705
- [ray gun blasting]

10:06.707 --> 10:09.541
- It keeps cookies
fresh for years.

10:09.543 --> 10:12.477
And people, too.
I'm 130.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.881
- Sweet Gam Gam, is this
the microchip cookie?

10:16.883 --> 10:19.751
- No, that's
the microchip cookie.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.987
- Is it true
you only made one?

10:21.989 --> 10:22.554
- Yes.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.990
- And it can be programmed
to taste like anything?

10:24.992 --> 10:25.624
- Yes.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.792
- Can I lick the glass?
- No.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.595
You can taste it after
we have a dip in my pool.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.031
- [gasps] The cookie
dough swimming pool?

10:33.033 --> 10:33.698
That's real?

10:33.700 --> 10:36.101
- Oh, you bet your sweet
snicker doodle it is.

10:36.103 --> 10:41.106
- Hey, Gam Gam, did you order
a giant bag of chocolate chips?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.073
- I don't know.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.710
I can't even remember the name
of this pretty young girl.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.847
- It's Billy
and I'm a boy.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.950
- Just leave the bag.

10:51.952 --> 10:55.086
Follow me,
my cookie crumbs.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.087
- Oh, this is great.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.057
I'm so glad I chose you, Billy.
- Me, too.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.072
- My plan worked!
We're in!

11:14.074 --> 11:16.875
- Yay! Maybe next time
add air holes to the bag.

11:16.877 --> 11:17.942
But, yay!

11:17.944 --> 11:22.781
- There it is, Nora--
the cookie of the future.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.684
- It's beautiful.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.086
Smash that glass!

11:28.088 --> 11:29.087
- Calm down.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.189
I'm gonna hack it open.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.260
Once my device finishes
deciphering the lock code,

11:35.262 --> 11:37.862
we can remove the glass
and eat that cookie.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.531
- You know, Max,
I've gotta say

11:39.533 --> 11:41.700
hanging out with
you's been really cool.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.301
- Oh. Yeah.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.604
- Now you say something
nice about me.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.673
- Oh, um...

11:53.080 --> 11:55.580
Boop!
[laughs]

11:55.749 --> 11:58.650
What? It's the best
I can come up with.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.553
- [pageant music playing]
- Pop the hip, Chloe.

12:01.555 --> 12:05.557
It's a sassy walk,
not a gassy walk.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.926
- Is this better?

12:07.928 --> 12:11.096
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.131
No.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.132
Watch.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.000
- [pageant music playing]

12:16.002 --> 12:19.137
- See? Fierce!
Confident!

12:19.139 --> 12:21.740
Pageantry!

12:21.742 --> 12:23.141
Now you keep
on practicing

12:23.143 --> 12:26.044
while I see where Colosso
is with your dress.

12:26.046 --> 12:30.849
Barb, she's at a three.
I need her at an eight.

12:31.818 --> 12:34.219
- Oh, you're working
so hard, sweetie.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.655
Are you excited
for the pageant?

12:37.657 --> 12:40.024
- Daddy is.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.627
- And what about you?

12:42.629 --> 12:44.763
- Daddy is.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.700
- I worked my paws
to the bone on this,

12:48.702 --> 12:52.036
but I'm pretty proud
of how it came out.

12:52.038 --> 12:52.937
- This isn't a dress.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.040
It's a diaper dipped
in who cares?

12:56.743 --> 13:01.012
- Keep it together, Colosso.
Don't let him see you cry.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.948
- Hank, can I have
a word with you?

13:03.950 --> 13:08.319
- Oh, sure, honey.
Make it sparkle, bunny.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.120
What's up, Barb?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.188
The pageant's in two hours

13:10.190 --> 13:12.757
and Chloe's hair's
a three-hour problem.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.325
- I wanted to talk
to you about Chloe.

13:14.327 --> 13:18.663
I'm worried she may not be as
into the pageant as you are.

13:18.665 --> 13:19.364
- Oh, that's crazy.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.199
I mean, look how much
fun she's having

13:21.201 --> 13:23.735
practicing her
sassy walk.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.337
- [tiny thud]

13:28.675 --> 13:30.675
Pageantry!

13:31.344 --> 13:34.179
- See? Time of her life.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.213
- I don't know.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.749
- Trust me, Barb.
She's lovin' it.

13:37.751 --> 13:40.318
And she's gonna
love her new hair.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.988
The bigger the hair,
the bigger the trophy!

13:45.091 --> 13:47.992
- Only one more number
stands between us

13:47.994 --> 13:50.094
and tasting history.

13:50.096 --> 13:50.995
- [gadget beeps]

13:50.997 --> 13:53.698
- [lock clicks]
- BOTH: We're in!

13:53.867 --> 13:55.934
- Oh, ho, ho.
It's magnificent.

13:55.936 --> 14:00.104
- And it smells like
a laptop dipped in sugar.

14:00.106 --> 14:02.774
- Now to program
the flavor.

14:02.776 --> 14:03.708
- [gadget beeping]

14:03.710 --> 14:04.809
- How about chocolate
turkey wasabi?

14:04.811 --> 14:09.314
- Ooh, it'll be like a Japanese
Thanksgiving in our mouths.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.081

14:10.083 --> 14:11.850
- SWEET GAM GAM's VOICE:
Downloading deliciousness.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.919
- Now watch the door and make
sure someone isn't coming.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.254
- I don't have to go
to the bathroom.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.857
- Just try. You don't wanna
be the guy who peed

14:18.859 --> 14:19.791
in the cookie dough pool.

14:19.793 --> 14:22.727
I'll just wait out here
with Max and Nora.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.762
Max and Nora!

14:25.098 --> 14:29.267
- Well, Japanese
Thanksgiving's been ruined.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.706
- Phoebe, I know
what you're thinking.

14:34.708 --> 14:35.874
- That you're
a terrible cheat

14:35.876 --> 14:37.809
who's about to steal
the cookie we won?

14:37.811 --> 14:40.311
- Yeah, that's
pretty much it.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.113
- I can't believe
you two.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.616
This was supposed to be
a beautiful brother-sister day.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.251
- It is--
for me and Dora.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.186
- Nora!
- Nora!

14:49.856 --> 14:52.090
- Max, come on,
put that down.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.658
- Or what?
- Or this...

14:53.660 --> 14:55.159
[blowing frosty air]

14:55.161 --> 14:57.595

Thank you!

14:59.099 --> 15:00.865
- [lasers zapping]

15:00.867 --> 15:03.568
- She froze me and stole
the cookie, didn't she?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.771
- Sure did. You
looked real dumb.

15:06.773 --> 15:07.639
- Come on, let's go.

15:07.641 --> 15:09.140
- [powers whooshing]
- Whoa!

15:09.142 --> 15:12.076
- Ha! Ha!
Now she looks dumb.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.211

15:13.213 --> 15:16.614
- [zooming]
Got it!

"wraps" that up.

15:23.857 --> 15:24.856
[blows air]

15:24.858 --> 15:27.158
- You're not funny, Phoebe.
- Yes, she is.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.328
And she's also not
dating Link anymore.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.630
- Don't worry, once we
put this cookie back,

15:32.632 --> 15:34.232
we'll free you two
so you can leave

15:34.234 --> 15:36.367
before you get in
trouble with Sweet Gam Gam.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.771
- What in the cinnamon
spice is going on here?

15:39.773 --> 15:42.340
- Oh, Sweet Gam Gam,
we can explain.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.108
- Save it,
cookie thieves!

15:44.110 --> 15:47.178
It's time to kick
some butterscotch!

15:47.180 --> 15:50.882

15:50.884 --> 15:52.951
- Hi-ya!

130-year-old lady

15:53.987 --> 15:56.120
kicking the sprinkles
out of them?

15:56.122 --> 15:58.623
- She sure is.
We should probably help.

15:58.625 --> 16:02.126
Hit 'em harder,
Gam Gam! Ha! Ha!

16:03.029 --> 16:04.262

of applause

- I know.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.716
What's that geezer
even doing in this competition?

16:25.885 --> 16:31.089
- Now our next contestant
is Chloe Thunderman!

16:31.091 --> 16:33.891
- AUDIENCE:

16:33.893 --> 16:36.127
- Now it's time for
the question and answer segment.

16:36.129 --> 16:40.865
So, Chloe, if you
had any superpower,

16:40.867 --> 16:42.934
what would that be?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.704
- World peace!

16:48.241 --> 16:50.842
- Well, the good news
is no one in the audience

16:50.844 --> 16:52.377
is gonna be hungry later.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.711
- Why is that?

16:53.713 --> 16:56.280
- Because they are
eating this up!

16:56.282 --> 16:57.682
- Now, a follow
up question.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.085
If you could just have
one wish, what would that be?

17:01.087 --> 17:04.822
- I wish I had
a magical unicorn.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.259
That poops world peace.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.262

That's my daughter!

what you're gonna be doing

17:14.367 --> 17:16.067
in the talent round
coming up.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.403

for everyone to see

17:18.405 --> 17:19.404
her tele-handsprings!

17:19.406 --> 17:23.975

decided to do my ribbon dance.

She is not having fun.

17:39.225 --> 17:42.026
- Ah, this is not
supposed to be fun, Barb.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.494
This is war.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.129
- Uh, Big Hank?

17:45.131 --> 17:46.931
- Oh, good, Little Hank.
I saved you a seat.

17:46.933 --> 17:50.435
- The lady's right--
Chloe's miserable out there

17:50.437 --> 17:52.170
trying to make our
dream come true.

17:52.172 --> 17:55.039
- Uh-huh, I think "miserable"
is a little strong,

17:55.041 --> 17:56.908
don't you think?

17:56.910 --> 17:58.509
- Pageantry.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.147
- Okay, I see it.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.048
What have I done?

18:04.050 --> 18:07.051
- Nothing that can't
be undone, big guy.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.754
I'll be at the snack bar.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.524
- That is one wise
imaginary boy.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.760
- Were you talking
to Little Hank?

18:15.762 --> 18:19.063
- No, I was
listening to him.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.065
Chloe, stop.

18:21.468 --> 18:26.170
I need to accept I lost this
pageant all those years ago.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.973
And I shouldn't have
made you enter this one.

18:28.975 --> 18:29.874
I'm sorry.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.342
- I forgive you, Daddy.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.844
- Oh, let's go home.

18:32.846 --> 18:37.014
- Wait, there's something
you have to do, first.

18:37.016 --> 18:37.515
- Really?

it's done, baby!

and watch this.

Ya! Ya!

call the cops

19:13.853 --> 19:16.988
and take us to prison
like a normal grandma?

19:16.990 --> 19:20.057
- Because I want
to do this!

19:20.059 --> 19:21.459
Ya!

19:23.263 --> 19:24.495
Ya!

19:24.497 --> 19:25.363
Hi-ya!

19:25.365 --> 19:26.130
- All right, Nora,

19:26.132 --> 19:28.966
I think I have a plan
to get us out of here

19:28.968 --> 19:29.934
and get us that cookie.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.103
- [lasers zapping]
And done!

19:32.105 --> 19:35.373
- For the record,
that was my plan.

19:37.110 --> 19:39.243
- Oh, come on.
What is that for?

19:39.245 --> 19:40.578
- Smacking fools!

19:40.580 --> 19:44.148
Ya! Hi-ya!

19:44.150 --> 19:46.284
Ya!

19:46.286 --> 19:47.218
- Hello, cookie.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.486
You're about to be
in my belly soon.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.555
There are a couple of
other cookies in there,

19:50.557 --> 19:52.256
but they meant
nothing to me.

19:52.258 --> 19:55.860
- Are you gonna eat
it or date it?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.362
- Ya!

19:58.364 --> 20:00.531
Hi-ya!

20:00.533 --> 20:02.300
That'll take
care of ya now!

20:02.302 --> 20:04.502
- Nora, something
about this feels wrong.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.237
- Yeah, you didn't
bring any milk.

20:06.239 --> 20:11.108
- No. I mean, Phoebe just
wanted to hang out with Billy.

20:11.110 --> 20:11.776
But because of us,

20:11.778 --> 20:15.880
they're both being smooshed
by a comically-large spatula.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.416
- Let 'em suffer!

20:18.418 --> 20:19.383
What's wrong with me?

20:19.385 --> 20:21.419
- I think this is why
we don't hang out.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.955
We're bad influences
on each other.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.022
- You're right.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.390
- PHOEBE: Why does
it hurt so bad?

20:26.392 --> 20:28.593
- We should probably save them.
- Yeah.

20:28.595 --> 20:29.894
Sweet Gam Gam, wait!

20:29.896 --> 20:31.195
You're flattening
the wrong people.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.196
We tried to steal
the cookie.

20:32.198 --> 20:35.967
- What the devil's chocolate
are you talking about?

20:35.969 --> 20:37.501
- We did it because
we were jealous

20:37.503 --> 20:39.904
our brother and sister
got to eat it.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.339
You should let them go.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.407
- Your honesty is
as refreshing as

20:43.409 --> 20:47.078
a glass of milk
after a cookie taco.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.113
- You really have
a cookie taco?

20:49.115 --> 20:51.916
- Soft and hard shell.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.117
- Hey, uh, could
you discuss this

20:53.119 --> 20:56.153
after you stop
squishing our organs?

21:01.628 --> 21:02.360
I'm so sorry, Billy.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.161
This is not how
I wanted our day to go.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.963
- Are you kidding?
You could have chosen anyone

21:05.965 --> 21:09.200
to get beaten up by Sweet
Gam Gam, and you chose me.

21:09.202 --> 21:10.501
- And I'd do it again.

21:10.503 --> 21:14.505
The choosing you, not
the massive amounts of pain.

21:15.174 --> 21:18.509
- Aw, I should
thank you guys.

21:18.511 --> 21:21.545
I haven't smacked
a fool in years.

21:21.547 --> 21:25.516
And it made me
feel 90 again!

21:25.518 --> 21:28.386
- Well, Sweet Gam Gam,
since we won the contest,

21:28.388 --> 21:31.022
is there any chance we can
still try the microchip cookie?

21:31.024 --> 21:34.725
- Yes, and you can
download any flavor you want.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.361
- Billy, you should
pick the flavor.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.297
- Okay.

21:41.034 --> 21:41.699
- [gadget beeping]

21:41.701 --> 21:45.536
- SWEET GAM GAM's VOICE:
Downloading deliciousness.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.370
- [bell dings]

21:46.372 --> 21:48.706
- Okay, everybody,
take a piece.

21:51.311 --> 21:54.412
- Guys, this is so good.
You have to try it.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.747
- ALL:
[crunching]

21:56.749 --> 21:58.616
Bleccch!

21:58.618 --> 22:00.551
Cat food?

22:00.553 --> 22:02.186
- SWEET GAM GAM:
[laughing]

22:02.188 --> 22:05.122
That little girl
is crazy.

22:09.462 --> 22:25.910
