And second, what was number one again?

08:21.417 --> 08:25.213
Let me spell it out for you, the reason
the foosa have been leaving you alone

08:25.296 --> 08:27.507
is because they have been
farming chickens,

08:27.590 --> 08:30.051

and keep your people safe,

you'll hand over that rooster right now.

I know what you're going to say, Maurice,
that I made the wrong decision.

09:12.176 --> 09:15.096
I shouldn't have sent that rooster back
to the foosa to be eaten.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.306
Actually, I can't believe I'm saying this,

09:17.390 --> 09:19.642

Your Majesty.

Well, I don't care what... Wait, what?
You say what?

09:22.353 --> 09:25.273
Either the foosa eat chickens
or the foosa eat us.

09:25.356 --> 09:28.568
By sending that rooster back,
you saved a lot of lemur lives.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.696
-You made a tough call, but I support it.
-You do?

09:31.779 --> 09:32.697
Mm-hmm.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.616
But, if you think I made
the right decision,

09:35.700 --> 09:37.994
why don't I feel better about it?

09:38.077 --> 09:42.915
Because decisions like these are hard.
But, as king, it's your job to make them.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.042
I like it better when I just had to decide

09:45.126 --> 09:47.378
whether or not to build
another trampoline.

I'm sure you'll feel better

Why don't you go bed?

At least now you should be able
to get some sleep.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.476
[Julien snoring]

10:03.060 --> 10:05.187
[whimpering]

10:07.064 --> 10:07.940
[both laughing]

10:08.608 --> 10:09.775
Huh?

10:10.943 --> 10:13.279
J'accuse! J'accuse! J'accuse!

10:13.863 --> 10:15.489
[gasps] Huh?

10:16.115 --> 10:17.033
[humming]

10:17.491 --> 10:18.993
There you are, Maurice.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.746
King Julien, are you all right?
You look terrible.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.080
[grunts]

10:23.164 --> 10:27.460
I haven't slept, Maurice.
I've been plagued by horrible nightmares.

10:27.543 --> 10:30.838
I just can't shake the feeling that
sending that jungle rooster back

10:30.921 --> 10:31.756
was wrong,

10:32.214 --> 10:34.258
which is why I have changed my mind!

10:34.342 --> 10:35.217
Changed your mind?

10:35.301 --> 10:38.095
Uh-huh, I've decided that I want to do
the wrong thing,

10:38.179 --> 10:40.139
which I actually think is the right thing.

10:40.222 --> 10:44.101
It's all very confusing. But the point is,
we have to get the jungle rooster back!

10:44.185 --> 10:46.228
But, it's too dangerous. The foosa--

10:46.312 --> 10:48.606
[exclaiming] Did someone say dangerous?

10:48.689 --> 10:51.359
'Cause I haven't done anything dangerous
in a really long while

10:51.442 --> 10:53.986
and I need a danger fix. Like, really bad!

10:54.070 --> 10:56.572
I'm coming too! You know, just 'cause.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.783
[spy music playing]

10:59.659 --> 11:00.826
-Hmm?
-Huh?

[growling]

11:08.709 --> 11:09.919
[sniffs]

11:15.466 --> 11:18.052
Look at all those chickens, Maurice.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.137
Yeah, it's worse than I thought.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.515
I don't know. Looks kinda homey to me.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.351
-[groans]
-Oh, are those panko crumbs they're using?

11:25.434 --> 11:27.144
[gasps] There's Karl and Mary Ann.

11:27.353 --> 11:31.190
Thank you for finding
and returning my rooster so quickly.

11:31.273 --> 11:35.236
That's why they call me
the Chicken Hunter.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.570
[rooster crowing]

11:36.987 --> 11:37.947
Oh, you.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.324
-[shrieks]
-[both laughing]

11:40.491 --> 11:41.409
Hmm.

11:41.492 --> 11:45.621
I have to admit, I was a little leery
of working with you, Karl,

11:45.704 --> 11:48.624
but it turns out we make
a pretty good team.

11:49.417 --> 11:54.672
What would you say to making our
working relationship more permanent?

11:55.548 --> 11:57.299
-Permanent?
-Official.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.968
[purrs]

11:59.427 --> 12:00.302
Uh...

12:00.678 --> 12:06.267
Think about it, if we combined forces,
we would be unstoppable.

12:06.350 --> 12:10.563
Together, we could rule all of Madagascar.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.314
[shrieking]

12:12.398 --> 12:16.277
I'm sorry, Your Majesty, there's nothing
we can do for the rooster now.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.779
Maurice is right, Your Majesty,
we can't be here.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.740
I need to take you back to the kingdom,
where it's safe.

12:25.786 --> 12:26.787
Mm?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.332
-[whimpering]
-Hmm.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.042
Mm-hmm.

12:32.793 --> 12:37.339
I thought a little snack might
cheer you up, Your Majesty. King Julien?

12:37.423 --> 12:40.551
King Julien? Wakey, wakey. Where'd he go?

12:41.385 --> 12:44.013
Let my roosters go!

12:44.096 --> 12:45.598
[grunts]

12:46.390 --> 12:48.142
[grunts and laughs]

12:48.434 --> 12:52.396
Uh, hey, buddy. Good to see you again.
How've you been?

12:52.563 --> 12:53.522
[clucks]

12:53.647 --> 12:55.316
Lock them up, Chauncey.

12:55.399 --> 12:59.445
Mary Ann will be so pleased when I
tell her tonight's fried chicken dinner

12:59.528 --> 13:03.616
will be served with a King Julien
dipping sauce.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.034
[laughing maniacally]

13:07.578 --> 13:11.248
Ah, they named a sauce after me.
That's really...

13:11.332 --> 13:12.750
Oh!

13:19.381 --> 13:22.384
I know you think I don't have a plan here,
but you just wait.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.385
[giggles]

13:23.469 --> 13:25.638
I'll get us out of here. You'll see.

13:25.721 --> 13:26.805
[clucks]

13:27.389 --> 13:29.225
[squeaking]

13:32.311 --> 13:35.731
Watch and learn, Jungle Rooster.
Watch and learn.

13:35.814 --> 13:36.815
Oh, hey, Chaunce.

13:36.899 --> 13:41.612
Surprised to see you here, you know,
since Karl and Mary Ann are an item now.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.864
They do make a cute couple though,
don't you think?

13:43.948 --> 13:44.907
[squeaking]

13:46.492 --> 13:47.451
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:47.535 --> 13:51.914
Relax, guy. I'm sure Mary Ann
isn't planning on getting rid of you.

13:51.997 --> 13:57.294
Who wouldn't want a tiny bug
as a third wheel always hanging around

13:57.378 --> 13:58.504
and getting in the way?

13:59.421 --> 14:03.759
I mean, really, what would Karl
and Mary Ann even do without you?

14:04.134 --> 14:05.469

[lemurs screaming]

14:16.939 --> 14:19.400
I love you, Mary Ann.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.736
But, don't you miss Chauncey?

14:22.820 --> 14:24.321
Chauncey who?

14:24.405 --> 14:26.240
[both laugh]

14:29.118 --> 14:30.578
[Karl] I'm so happy!

14:31.662 --> 14:33.122
[whimpers]

14:34.415 --> 14:38.794
You know, on second thought,
Mary Ann doesn't strike me as a sharer.

14:38.878 --> 14:43.090
If I were you, I'd get rid of her
before she gets rid of you.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.467
Just my two cents, you know,
take it or leave it.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.054

15:11.535 --> 15:13.537
What, you thought
I couldn't pick this lock?

15:13.621 --> 15:16.206
Please, too easy. Follow me.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.462
[both scream]

15:22.004 --> 15:22.838
This is it.

15:22.922 --> 15:23.756
King Julien.

15:23.839 --> 15:24.673
[screams]

15:24.757 --> 15:28.093
You ate Maurice, too! My best friend!

No!

15:33.724 --> 15:35.225
[sobbing]

15:35.643 --> 15:39.146
No, King Julien. It's me.
I haven't been eaten.

15:39.229 --> 15:40.814
We're disguised as a foosa.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.691
Oh. Wait, who's we?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.194
Hi, King Julien. This is great, isn't it?

15:45.277 --> 15:47.446
[giggles] Hi!

15:48.113 --> 15:52.910
[Xixi] Xixi here, reporting live
from inside a foosa costume. [chuckles]

15:52.993 --> 15:54.536
We came to save you, King Julien.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.080
We can talk about the fact that you left

15:56.163 --> 15:57.957
without telling anyone
where you're going later.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.084
You got the jungle rooster back,
like you wanted,

16:00.167 --> 16:02.503
so now it's time to get you outta here.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.879

-What?
-What? Say what?

16:20.771 --> 16:21.647
I'm hungry.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.023
Don't you understand?

16:23.107 --> 16:27.194
Being a great king isn't about doing
the right thing or the wrong thing.

16:27.277 --> 16:32.282
It's about doing the great thing.
We have to save all the roosters!

16:32.408 --> 16:33.575
[clucks]

16:34.284 --> 16:35.661
I'm with you, Your Majesty.

-Mm.
-Yeah, Mort's in too.

16:43.669 --> 16:47.006
Just one thing, how in the world
are we gonna free all these chickens

16:47.089 --> 16:48.966
right out from under the foosa's' noses?

16:49.174 --> 16:50.551
Don't worry, Maurice.

16:50.634 --> 16:54.054
Operation Love Triangle
is already in motion.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.597
Karl!

16:56.265 --> 16:58.892
Mary Ann, darling. Whatever is the matter?

16:58.976 --> 17:01.687
Don't play dumb and don't call me darling!

17:01.770 --> 17:04.982
You think you can send your
little cockroach friend to take me out

17:05.065 --> 17:07.443
so that you can take over my kingdom?

17:07.568 --> 17:10.487
I should have known better
than to trust you!

17:10.571 --> 17:12.031
I don't know what you're talking about,

17:12.114 --> 17:14.575
but I'm sure there's a logical explanation
for all of this.

17:14.658 --> 17:18.287

Oh, right, right. I remember.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.657
Okay, first chicken, go.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.078
Chauncey. Come here this minute
and tell me what's going on.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.288
I'll tell you what's going on.

18:01.371 --> 18:04.541
I'm going to kill you
and your little friend.

18:04.625 --> 18:09.213
Now, just one minute.
Chauncey, what did you do?

18:09.296 --> 18:10.297

18:14.551 --> 18:18.597
I should have known. Well played, Julien.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.141
Uh. He can't see me. He can't see me.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.977
Oh, I see you.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.189
Mary Ann, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

18:27.272 --> 18:29.775
but all of your chickens are getting away.

18:41.745 --> 18:44.248
King Julien, what do we do now?

18:44.414 --> 18:48.252
Hey, Clover. Now would be a good time
to do your angry fighting thing.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.295
-Over here!
-[Julien] What are you doing?

18:50.420 --> 18:51.463

18:53.924 --> 18:55.384
I don't mean to micromanage,

18:55.467 --> 18:58.804
but I think it would be better
if you kicked the foosa, Clover!

18:58.887 --> 19:00.264
-[all gasp]
-Popcorn!

19:01.265 --> 19:03.267
Not so fast, Karl!

19:05.394 --> 19:08.689
Chauncey, where are you going?
Don't leave me here.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.652
What are you all waiting for? Attack!

19:13.735 --> 19:14.570
Popcorn.

19:16.572 --> 19:20.492
Get the chickens to safety, Your Majesty.
I'll keep the foosa busy.

This way, guys. Follow me.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.215
What kind of birds are you?

20:16.298 --> 20:18.508
Seriously, you guys can't talk.
You can't fly.

You're the worst birds ever. I mean, ever!
