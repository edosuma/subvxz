(CRYING)

01:56.158 --> 01:58.820
Hey.
Slow down, sister.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.525
Actually,
I need to speed up.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.778
Rachel woke up
early with a fever

02:02.873 --> 02:06.365
and she's been
terrorizing me
all morning.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.658
I'm already late.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.039
Sorry, the stakeout
went longer
than I thought.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.287
Have you ever
been to a rave?

02:11.381 --> 02:12.416
Goodbye.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.835
You're already late,
and Rachel's sick.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.759
Neither of which can be
solved by you leaving
right this second.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.425
The entire hospital's
depending on a proposal
l have yet to finish

02:20.557 --> 02:21.888
and need to
present at 8:30.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.090
It's 7:30.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.261
It's 7:37.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.014
I'll have you on
the road in 10 minutes.

02:26.104 --> 02:30.894
Come on, you don't wanna get
into your meeting all tight
and stressed out, do you?

02:40.786 --> 02:42.276
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

02:43.288 --> 02:44.744
It's yours.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.738
It's House.
lgnore it.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.331
It says,
"Emergency page."

02:48.418 --> 02:49.794
I said ignore it.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.080
Sweet.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.920
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

03:01.765 --> 03:03.346
I'm sorry,
it's hard
to pace yourself

03:03.433 --> 03:05.515
when you've been
thinking about it
for 10 hours straight.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.718
That's great,

03:07.813 --> 03:11.271
now I'm late,
stressed out
and frustrated.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.482
So, if you give me
a minute, I can...

03:14.569 --> 03:15.604
It'll wait.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.947
(SIGHING)

03:22.452 --> 03:23.783
You can do it.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.572
Do what?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.287
I thought you were
coming in at 7:30.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.830
Rachel woke
up with a fever,

04:10.917 --> 04:14.501
and then ljust
couldn't get here
any sooner.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.165
There's a problem
in the pharmacy.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.962
HOUSE: Hey, boss lady!

04:18.175 --> 04:20.131
You don't answer
emergency pages anymore?

04:20.218 --> 04:21.879
Tell them all
I'll be by as
soon as I can.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.300
And tell him I assumed
it was either about
the wolf again

04:25.390 --> 04:28.678
or the procedure
I refused to approve
yesterday.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.552
Turned out it wasn't
a resistant staph,

04:31.688 --> 04:34.304
but I still say if it
had been, infecting
him with malaria...

04:34.399 --> 04:36.606
Seriously, House,
I don't have time for this.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.649
You're lying.
l have a meeting
in 20 minutes.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.102
Not talking about
your meeting.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.403
I'm talking about
the phone call.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.364
I didn't ask what
you were talking about
because I don't care.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.702
l was with your
boytoy on the
stakeout last night.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.496
You were with Lucas?

04:51.583 --> 04:55.622
He needed someone who could
diagnose a soft tissue injury
from across the street.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.044
Apparently
he doesn't know
any good doctors.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.165
Or the ones he does
know actually have
lives outside of work.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.877
Things got a little slow,
so we made some wagers.

05:05.388 --> 05:09.882
One being whether
I could get you to stop
the miscegenation

05:10.227 --> 05:12.559
with an emergency page.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.813
What made
you think we'd...

05:13.897 --> 05:15.558
He said you guys
do it every morning.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.021
Everybody lies,
remember?

05:17.108 --> 05:18.143
So you weren't actually...

05:18.235 --> 05:19.350
Goodbye, House.

05:19.444 --> 05:22.811
I'm gonna need a
definitive answer before
any money changes hands.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.488
Sorry to interrupt,
but the GRC called
about the budgets,

05:25.575 --> 05:28.988
the pharmacy is still waiting,
and your 8:30 just
arrived on campus.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.944
He should be here
in 10 minutes.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.948
Figures this would
be the one day
he comes early.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.494
Can you proofread
this for me?

05:35.585 --> 05:36.961
When are you
gonna find your
own assistant?

05:37.087 --> 05:40.079
Not today. Thank you.
I'll be back in five.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.919
Dr. Cuddy.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.921
I know we're usually
fine with two CS reps,

05:46.054 --> 05:48.420
but I want a few
extra hands today,
just in case.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.263
And have lT
recheck the network.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.507
I don't want
to hear later that

05:51.601 --> 05:54.684
the new lines can
only dial out or the
computer crashed.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.227
What's going on?
Hopefully, nothing.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.431
Just make sure you're ready
if people start calling.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.018
You wanted to see me?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.273
Hey, Dr. Cuddy, yeah.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.692
I wanted to let you know
there's a problem
with one of the orders

06:06.783 --> 06:08.193
that came in last night.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.570
Which is?

06:09.786 --> 06:11.777
They sent double
the amount of meds
we ordered.

06:11.913 --> 06:12.902
Did you call
and ask why?

06:12.998 --> 06:14.363
Yeah. They insist
it's not a mistake.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.833
80 fax them
the original PO.

06:15.959 --> 06:20.293
Yeah, that's what I was
planning on doing,
but I can't find it.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.253
Actually, I can't
find any of them.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.423
Oscar, I don't have time
to straighten out
your paperwork.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.125
Where's Stan?
He doesn't get in till 9:00.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.877
And it's actually
not my paperwork,

06:28.972 --> 06:30.803
it's Gail's paperwork,
and she's out sick today.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.548
So put it on her desk
and let her figure it out
when she comes back.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.053
All right,
but it's not my
problem if...

06:35.145 --> 06:37.932
Oscar, not today,
okay?

06:40.609 --> 06:42.315
Was it the whole shipment
orjust one med?

06:42.402 --> 06:43.562
It's just one.

06:43.653 --> 06:44.642
Vicodin?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.899
No, 25-milligram
ephedrine tablets.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.700
What?
Call Gail.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.785
Tell her I want
to see her in
my office ASAP.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.079
But she's sick.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.202
This place is full
of sick people,
just get her in here.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.576
Dr. Cuddy,
your 8:30 is waiting
in your office.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.785
Now.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.040
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

07:03.131 --> 07:05.042
I gotta make
a quick trip upstairs.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.258
Can you get the guy in
my office a cup of coffee?
I'll be right back.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.711
I've gotten you
coffee before.

07:13.683 --> 07:14.798
What's wrong?

07:14.893 --> 07:17.384
It’s freezing in here.
/ can hardly feel
my fingers.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.806
Please tell me
you didn't send
a 911 page

07:19.898 --> 07:21.513
to tell me the
heater’s broken.

07:21.650 --> 07:22.730
It's not broken.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.898
House bribed the physical
plant to turn on the
AC so I'd hurry up.

07:27.030 --> 07:27.985
So hurry up.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.938
This man's abdomen
is wide open.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.773
His core temp
is down to 95!

07:31.868 --> 07:33.654
Fine,
I will deal with it.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.736
You better,
or I'm gonna file...

07:36.164 --> 07:39.577
I don't care
what he told you.
Turn it back up, now.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.209
Thought you had
an important meeting.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.581
You're an idiot.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.877
What are you gonna do the
next time one of your patients
needs a liver transplant?

07:48.009 --> 07:51.968
Go talk to Wilson about
something completely unrelated
and see what happens.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.296
Mystery infection guy
is now covered in boils

07:54.391 --> 07:57.098
and has an abscess
big enough to put
your fist in.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.559
He needs
to get into an OR
tout de suite.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.474
Hourani will
be done soon.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.690
Good.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.765
I'll have some hot
chocolate waiting.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.440
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

08:06.528 --> 08:09.235
Marina. Hey,
how is she doing?

08:10.407 --> 08:12.147
She vomited?

08:12.242 --> 08:15.575
Give her some more
ibuprofen and put her
in the bath for a bit.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.538
And call me in
a half hour if
it doesn't go down.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.283
(PHONE BEEPS)
Sorry, Marina,
l have another call.

08:19.374 --> 08:22.081
Just call me in
a half hour either way.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.034
Hey, what's up?

08:24.796 --> 08:26.536
Tell him
I'm halfway there.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.128
He's the one
who insisted on
the early meeting.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.584
All right,
I'm coming.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.103
Morning, Eli.
Sorry about the wait.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.441
That's all right.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.815
I hear you've
got a sick kid.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.024
Yeah, I know
what that's like.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.728
Or, I should say,
my wife does.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.941
So, you guys ready
to give some ground so
we can make this deal?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.450
Why would we do that?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.198
We've been
going at this
for eight months.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.904
As soon
as you decide
to get reasonable.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.115
I'm the one
that's unreasonable?

09:03.251 --> 09:05.663
You've taken weeks
to respond to every
proposal l've presented.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.037
AtlanticNet Insurance is
the largest healthcare
provider in New Jersey,

09:09.132 --> 09:11.623
and you're not
the only hospital whose
contracts are up.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.341
So is your team
ready to come
back to the table?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.756
Yeah.
We're not going to.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.221
This is our final offer.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.889
We're willing
to go with
a capitated structure,

09:19.976 --> 09:21.887
but we need at
least a 12% increase

09:21.978 --> 09:24.640
in reimbursements
across the board.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.140
Well, good news
is I can give you
a quick response.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.313
Not a chance.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.107
But as always,
nice talking to you.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.813
Say hi to your
sister for me.

09:39.162 --> 09:43.246
If you don't accept
the offer, we're gonna
terminate the contract.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.742
Gonna be hard
to keep this place open

09:46.836 --> 09:49.794
if all your patients
have to pay cash.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.873
Princeton-Plainsboro
is the smallest hospital
in our entire network.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.749
We're also the best.
It doesn't matter.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.960
We are responsible
for covering
13 million people.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.920
We don't have enough cash
to buy them all Maseratis.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.758
I know what you pay
Bergen, Newark Beth Israel,
Robert Wood Johnson...

10:02.852 --> 10:04.467
It's because
they have leverage.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.554
You can be expensive or small,
but you can't be both.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.022
l've engaged
Jones/Curtin
to handle the PR

10:10.151 --> 10:13.860
and I'm prepared
to make the announcement
at 3:00 pm. today.

10:14.823 --> 10:18.691
First lesson every
good poker player learns
is don't get emotional.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.442
You don't have the cards.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.572
And the sooner
you realize that,

10:21.663 --> 10:24.700
the sooner
a reasonable contract
will get signed.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.414
You have until 3:00 pm.
to change your mind.

10:30.213 --> 10:34.582
I always did like your style.
Gonna be sad to see you go.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.565
They're waiting for you
in the conference room.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.987
Thanks.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.318
Take this up
to the call center

11:03.413 --> 11:05.369
and tell Claudia
to give one
to each CS rep

11:05.456 --> 11:07.617
and to start going
over the answers
to each question.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.785
Okay.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.910
And under no circumstances
is any of this info
to go outside that room.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.838
The scripts are numbered,
and I want a list of every
person she gives one to.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.176
Got it.
Anything else?

11:17.260 --> 11:18.420
No.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.848
If you really wanted
to make a deal,

11:22.932 --> 11:24.183
you should've
ditched the push-up

11:24.267 --> 11:25.928
and gone
with the demi.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.135
Nothing makes
a guy wanna close
like highbeams.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.306
What have you heard?

11:29.439 --> 11:31.896
Your meeting with
the weasel lasted
less than five minutes,

11:31.983 --> 11:35.942
which means you either
agreed to a completely
sensible 30-day extension

11:36.029 --> 11:40.523
or one of you issued
a completely
ridiculous ultimatum.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.287
Oh, goody,
you or him?

11:45.371 --> 11:46.406
Me.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.579
Way to go, boss.
You said it was ridiculous.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.043
Ridiculous to make,
fun to watch.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.083
As long as it's
notjust a bluff.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.331
Please tell me
it's not a bluff.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.380
It's not a bluff,
and it's not ridiculous.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.129
Just because
we're not some huge...

12:00.887 --> 12:03.173
Mr. Pluta started
hallucinating before
we could put him under.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.262
His BP's plummeting,
he has an elevated
heart rate.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.090
Looks like
congestive heart failure.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.345
Interesting.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.934
I don't care
how interesting it is,

12:10.021 --> 12:12.808
you are not
infecting him
with malaria.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.106
Since when is malaria
a cure for heart failure?

12:15.193 --> 12:19.983
It's not. It's not
congestive heart failure,
it's gotta be one of the...

12:24.702 --> 12:27.159
ljust got off
the phone with Hourani.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.115
I'm sorry, Dave,
I don't really have time...

12:29.207 --> 12:31.414
You think I had time
to listen to him
go for 20 minutes

12:31.501 --> 12:32.911
about the damn
temperature in the OR?

12:33.002 --> 12:34.117
I took care of it.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.828
It's not an "it," it's a "him"
you need to take care of.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.335
You've got the entire
staff catering to
House's every whim,

12:39.425 --> 12:42.212
and I can't get approval
to hire a replacement
for the surgeon

12:42.345 --> 12:44.006
he stole from
my department.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.713
A doctor | only took on
in the first place because
of pressure from you.

12:46.849 --> 12:50.933
So you didn't want Chase,
but now you're pissed
you can't have him?

12:51.020 --> 12:52.180
You want to convene
a search committee

12:52.272 --> 12:53.933
and start looking
for a new chief
of surgery?

12:54.023 --> 12:55.138
No, Dave.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.689
Then you better stop
spending all your time

12:56.776 --> 13:00.360
putting out his fires
and start doing your damn job.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.192
(CLEARING THROAT)

13:07.578 --> 13:09.830
There a problem
with Dr. Thomas?

13:09.914 --> 13:13.406
No, just refereeing
a dispute about the OR.

13:13.793 --> 13:19.208
So, we don't yet
have a contract
with AtlanticNet.

13:20.258 --> 13:24.046
We gave you an extra week.
And you assured us
you'd have a deal by today.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.049
We could have a deal,
just not the deal
we deserve.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.426
So, what do you want,
approval for an extension?

13:29.559 --> 13:31.049
We've been at this
for eight months,

13:31.144 --> 13:33.430
an extension
isn't going to
change anything.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.598
So what's your plan?

13:34.689 --> 13:35.929
I presented
a final offer.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.807
I told them
that we would agree
to a capitated structure

13:38.901 --> 13:42.064
if they increase
reimbursements by 12%.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.437
A final offer.
What does that mean?

13:44.574 --> 13:48.192
If they don't
accept it by 3:00,
we're gonna terminate.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.993
Are you out
of your mind?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.116
If we don't accept
AtlanticNet Insurance

13:53.207 --> 13:55.243
we'll lose 80%
of our patients.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.582
We'd be lucky
to last three months.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.794
We're not asking
for anything
they can't afford.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.664
Their last offer
was a 4% increase,

14:02.759 --> 14:04.044
and you're demanding 12?

14:04.135 --> 14:06.501
They're paying even
more at some places.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.257
Units that have
lower ratings
than ours.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.175
In a perfect world
that would definitely
matter.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.097
Sanford,
they're all
about growth,

14:12.226 --> 14:15.889
and they know they don't get
new customers by marketing
themselves as the biggest.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.720
They do it by claiming
they're the best,

14:17.815 --> 14:21.057
and they can't do that
if their patients can't
come to us.

14:22.612 --> 14:23.852
(SIGHING)

14:23.946 --> 14:26.232
What was Morgan's reaction
when you told him?

14:26.324 --> 14:29.282
He didn't give in.
But he will.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.653
I told him
I'd make the
announcement at 3:00.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.996
He'll call back
before then.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.120
They need us.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.872
No, we need them.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.748
We need each other.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.624
The negotiation is
your responsibility,

14:46.761 --> 14:49.628
so we can't stop you
if this is what you
want to do.

14:49.764 --> 14:54.007
But just so we're clear,
if we don't have a
contract with AtlanticNet,

14:54.143 --> 14:56.725
you're not gonna
have a contract with us.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.642
Guess who didn't show
up for clinic duty.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.515
(GROANING)
Don't tell me,

15:40.606 --> 15:42.517
the guy with all
the boils needs
a liver transplant.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.231
No, his doctor
needs a nap.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.569
You want me to try
to find him?

15:45.695 --> 15:48.107
You really need him?
I need someone.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.690
I have cancer.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.160
Why do you think
you have cancer?

15:53.244 --> 15:56.577
I don't think I have cancer,
I know I have cancer.

15:56.914 --> 16:00.998
I had surgery to remove
a malignant polyp in
my colon six months ago,

16:01.085 --> 16:03.167
and now it's spread
to my liver
and lymph nodes.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.620
So you're under
the care of an oncologist?

16:05.715 --> 16:07.751
Yeah, but he won't give me
the prescription I need.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.465
You need more
pain killers?

16:09.552 --> 16:11.713
No, I need breast milk.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.630
Human breast milk?

16:15.725 --> 16:18.011
Yes, it has
cancer-fighting
qualities.

16:18.102 --> 16:21.390
Well, in newborns
it's been shown to
reduce future risk...

16:21.522 --> 16:25.435
No. In adults
with cancer, too.
I've read studies.

16:27.987 --> 16:32.151
Look, I even know
a place where
I can buy it.

16:32.241 --> 16:36.735
ljust need a prescription
so I can get reimbursed
by my insurance company.

16:36.871 --> 16:41.080
They said they'd reimburse
the cost of breast milk
as a cancer treatment?

16:41.167 --> 16:42.998
They reimburse
prescriptions.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.165
So, if you write
me a prescription,

16:44.253 --> 16:45.584
then they have
no choice but to pay.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.580
Well, actually,
they have a choice.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.423
What are you,
some type of shill for
the insurance company?

16:51.552 --> 16:54.259
No.
I've been paying
premiums for 30 years

16:54.347 --> 16:57.760
and I've never been
sick a day in my life
till this happened.

16:57.892 --> 17:01.350
Now I can't work.
I got no money,

17:01.854 --> 17:03.185
and you want to help
them screw me over.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.307
I'm not screwing
you over.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.021
Well, then give me
the script.
It won't help you.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.439
Will it hurt me?
No,but”

17:07.527 --> 17:11.065
Okay, so it won't harm me
and it won't harm you,

17:11.197 --> 17:13.279
but it's this insurance
company...
This is not about insurance.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.693
Then give me
the damn script!

17:15.785 --> 17:17.195
(SIGHING)

17:21.958 --> 17:23.448
I'm sick.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.292
I need help.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.377
I'm sorry.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.974
Bitch.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.140
Anyone call?

17:49.235 --> 17:50.350
Yeah.

17:51.445 --> 17:55.154
The ER. They said
the vascular who's on call
doesn't have privileges.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.822
Then why is he on call?

17:56.951 --> 17:58.566
Dowd's at a conference
and got him to fill in.

17:58.661 --> 18:02.324
Be nice if he got somebody
who could actually work here.
Call Ereshefsky.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.321
Ereshefsky?
She's not gonna do it.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.447
She owes me a favor.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.828
She's still not
gonna do it.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.584
All right.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.163
Oh, and there's
a guy in your office.
I think he's a lawyer.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.338
Why is he
in my office?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.082
Said he didn't
want to sit around
a bunch of sick people.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.304
I tried to stop him.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.761
Hi. I'm Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.013
Ronald Westbrook.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.011
I appreciate
your taking the time
to meet with me.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.188
Hard to avoid,
since you're already
in my office.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.687
Sorry about that,
I just got over
a wicked cold.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.275
I didn't want to...
How can I help you?

18:33.362 --> 18:35.523
I represent
Martin Acevedo.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.693
He's filed a suit
against PPH and
Dr. Robert Chase

18:38.784 --> 18:41.036
for performing surgery
without consent.

18:41.162 --> 18:44.700
Yes, I saw that.
I also saw the
consent forms.

18:44.832 --> 18:45.867
They were all signed.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.368
Yes, but my client
was assured

18:47.460 --> 18:50.122
that the procedure
would just be a
few minor sutures.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.954
Wait, your client
accidentally cut
his thumb off

18:53.049 --> 18:54.459
with a table saw, right?
Yes.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.256
And Dr. Chase
reattached it?

18:56.344 --> 18:57.550
Yes.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.756
You're saying
he didn't want it
reattached?

18:59.847 --> 19:02.714
No, he most
certainly did not.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.558
His insurance only
covered 60% of
inpatient expenses,

19:06.687 --> 19:08.552
so he would only agree
to the cheapest option.

19:08.689 --> 19:09.724
So what did you tell him?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.807
I said I'd sew up
the skin over
the exposed bone.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.062
Then I put him under,

19:14.153 --> 19:17.316
got his thumb from
the paramedics
and reattached it.

19:17.865 --> 19:18.900
What's he gonna do?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.482
Tell a judge that
I harmed him by
reattaching a vital digit?

19:21.577 --> 19:25.570
Both he and the insurance
company are suing to get
out of paying the bill.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.155
It's over $80,000.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.625
It was his thumb.

19:28.918 --> 19:32.752
I couldn'tjust let him
toss it in the trash
to save a few bucks.

19:36.217 --> 19:40.301
The pharm tech who called
in sick is here. She's
waiting in your office.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.714
He barely even
looks at me anymore.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.549
We haven't had
sex in months.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.593
You don't need
pills to lose weight.

19:50.231 --> 19:53.394
There are healthier ways,
legal ways.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.395
You don't understand
how hard it is.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.566
Ever since our second child,
no matter what I do...

19:59.657 --> 20:03.821
ljust wanted to lose
10 more pounds, and
then I was gonna stop.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.651
I'm sorry.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.821
Forging pharmaceutical
orders, stealing...

20:08.916 --> 20:10.201
Don't fire me, Dr. Cuddy.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.954
Please, I'm begging you.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.380
If Sam finds out,
he'll divorce me for sure.
And my kids...

20:18.342 --> 20:22.551
I will never do it again,
I swear. Just give
me a second chance.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.593
I won't report
the theft to the DEA.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.263
But I have to fire you.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.977
(CRYING)

20:35.192 --> 20:38.525
Just take a few minutes
to compose yourself,

20:38.612 --> 20:41.854
then go down to HR,
and they'll give you
your last check.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.565
I've been a perfect
employee for seven years.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.322
I know, but this
is too big.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.615
I'm sorry.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.724
(SIGHING)

21:13.481 --> 21:14.846
How's it going?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.602
I've got three hours
to save this place
from bankruptcy,

21:17.693 --> 21:19.354
I just fired one of
my best employees,

21:19.487 --> 21:22.945
and the woman taking care
of my sick child isn't
returning my calls.

21:23.032 --> 21:26.024
Rachel's gonna be fine,
I'm sure whoever he
or she is deserved it,

21:26.160 --> 21:29.197
and we're not going
bankrupt. Are we?

21:29.705 --> 21:32.367
Don't worry. The board
will fire me before they
allow that to happen.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.369
They'd never fire you.

21:35.044 --> 21:39.708
I just told AtlanticNet
Insurance I'd terminate unless
they give us a 12% bump.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.710
They might fire you.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.216
Marina, hey, it's me.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.552
I haven't heard back
from you. Can you call me
as soon as you can?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.056
Thank you.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.225
You try Lucas?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.641
He's either sleeping
or avoiding me.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.843
You in a fight?

21:53.938 --> 21:55.303
Not yet, but
we're gonna be.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.905
What do you think
I should do about
AtlanticNet?

22:06.992 --> 22:10.655
You're asking a guy
who paid full sticker
price for his last car.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.407
You ask House?

22:13.415 --> 22:15.997
He is a master
manipulator who always
gets what he wants.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.167
This situation is
out of control
enough already.

22:18.254 --> 22:21.542
House is the last person
I want to get involved.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.931
Get out of my chair,
and the answer's no.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.769
Have you noticed how many
porn sites have "mom"
in the domain name?

22:36.897 --> 22:40.014
Hot moms,
hungry moms,
mature moms.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.600
That ought
to make you feel
pretty good.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.939
What do you want?

22:48.075 --> 22:51.112
Looks like boils,
altered mental status
and heart failure

22:51.245 --> 22:52.860
was caused by renal
cell carcinoma.

22:52.955 --> 22:56.038
I need your signature
to start treating it
with malaria.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.456
Don't worry.
I'm giving him
chemo, too.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.374
What is your
sudden obsession
with malaria?

22:59.461 --> 23:02.123
Just trying
to play my part,
cutting costs.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.297
Malaria is the simplest,
cheapest method of
delivering hyperthermia.

23:05.426 --> 23:08.259
Right, the only money
you care about...

23:08.721 --> 23:12.305
You bet someone
you could use malaria
as a diagnostic tool?

23:12.558 --> 23:13.798
That doesn't
sound like me.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.383
Forget it.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.887
Okay, let me see
if I've got this
straight,

23:16.979 --> 23:19.971
a bet that puts
one patient at minor
nskisjuvenHe”.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.601
And irresponsible
and dangerous.

23:21.692 --> 23:24.809
But going all-in
against AtlanticNet...

23:25.112 --> 23:26.648
Is not a bet.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.572
That is a carefully
considered
negotiating position.

23:30.993 --> 23:33.484
I'm gonna put
this in your in-box.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.910
I just hope
it doesn't get lost

23:34.997 --> 23:39.081
underneath all the
other stuff you're
carefully considering.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.466
Can you take a look
at these per diem schedules,

23:46.592 --> 23:48.423
let me know if
you see any conflicts?
Got it.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.252
Oh, and Ereshefsky
actually did come in.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.258
You catch her leaving
a sponge in a guy
or something?

23:53.349 --> 23:55.260
Wasn't a medical mistake.
What was it?

23:55.351 --> 23:56.932
Can't tell you now.
She came in.

23:57.019 --> 24:00.762
Hey, Stan, have you
audited the ephedrine
orders, yet?

24:00.856 --> 24:02.687
Why? You told me
she confessed.
Stan!

24:02.816 --> 24:03.851
All right, yeah,
I'll take care of it.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.979
Today.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.560
You know he's
cussing you out now.

24:07.655 --> 24:08.940
I don't care,
as long as
he does it.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.146
What a bitch.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.366
What are you
doing here?

24:11.492 --> 24:13.357
Sounded like you were
gonna be too busy
for lunch, so...

24:13.452 --> 24:14.783
My specialty.
Spinach lasagna.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.371
Sure you didn't come
looking for more people

24:16.455 --> 24:18.787
you could brag about
our sex life to?

24:18.874 --> 24:20.159
Okay, sorry.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.617
From now on I've got
nothing but bad things
to say about our sex life.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.498
Or nothing to say.

24:26.048 --> 24:28.039
And what's going on
with Marina? She
hasn't called me back.

24:28.175 --> 24:31.383
She was gonna call,
I told her I'd let you know
everything was okay.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.880
So her fever broke?

24:33.013 --> 24:35.550
What exactly
does that mean,
when a fever breaks?

24:35.683 --> 24:38.345
Lucas, I'm very busy,
does she have a fever
or not?

24:38.435 --> 24:40.346
That was gonna
be your lunch?

24:40.437 --> 24:42.644
And you didn't have
breakfast either.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.312
No, she doesn't
have a fever,

24:44.400 --> 24:46.857
and the rash
was just like
a little diaper rash.

24:46.944 --> 24:47.979
What rash?
She has a rash?

24:48.070 --> 24:49.856
A little one.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.196
Lisa, don't worry,
I'm telling you.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.819
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

24:54.910 --> 24:56.320
Come on.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.405
Oh, God. I must have
grabbed Marina's
cell by mistake.

25:02.584 --> 25:03.915
(EXHALING)

25:05.379 --> 25:09.713
And I turned the ringer off
on the home phone
so I could sleep.

25:10.968 --> 25:12.128
What are you
doing to me?

25:12.219 --> 25:13.425
I take it your
deal's not done.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.013
Not yet.

25:15.097 --> 25:18.385
How about I take a quick
look into the guy who's
in charge of the negotiations,

25:18.475 --> 25:20.466
or better yet, the CEO.

25:20.561 --> 25:23.098
If I get some dirt,
you can use it
as leverage.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.099
There's no time.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.766
How do you even
find these guys?

25:34.575 --> 25:35.985
You should've
seen the guy's face.

25:36.076 --> 25:39.193
I thought he was gonna
have a damn coronary
right there in the tee box.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.700
Excuse me,
you're Keith Tannenbaum,

25:41.790 --> 25:43.906
CEO of AtlanticNet
Insurance, right?

25:44.001 --> 25:45.582
That's me.
How can I help you?

25:45.669 --> 25:47.375
Well, actually,
I think we can
help each other.

25:47.463 --> 25:51.422
I am Dr. Lisa Cuddy,
Dean of Medicine
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.885
Oh, yeah.
Well, how are you?

25:53.969 --> 25:55.425
Well, I'm a
little unhappy.

25:55.512 --> 25:58.094
You're aware that our
contract with your company
is up this week.

25:58.182 --> 26:00.468
Yes, and we have
a negotiating team that's
working all that out.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.596
Princeton-Plainsboro
has the highest
rated ER in the state,

26:03.687 --> 26:05.348
the most advanced ICU,

26:05.439 --> 26:09.432
and the most innovative
diagnostic medicine department
in the entire country.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.517
Good to know.
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to...

26:11.612 --> 26:14.149
While AtlanticNet Insurance
has a marketing budget

26:14.239 --> 26:17.731
that is more than our
pediatric ICU's and
transplant unit's combined.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.203
Your PGA sponsorship
could pay for
our walk-in clinic,

26:20.287 --> 26:22.323
and the money you
spend to fuel your
two private jets

26:22.414 --> 26:25.952
could fund our air
ambulance service
for the next three years.

26:26.043 --> 26:27.078
Your point being?

26:27.169 --> 26:28.750
Your growth may be good
for your bottom line,

26:28.837 --> 26:30.828
but ours allows us
to save lives.

26:30.923 --> 26:34.131
And Iwould rather
not have to announce
to the press

26:34.218 --> 26:38.461
how selective your company
appears to be when it
comes to cutting costs.

26:40.682 --> 26:41.888
(MUMBLING)

26:41.975 --> 26:45.388
Morgan was right.
You are one tough gal.

26:49.733 --> 26:53.066
You can portray me as
a rich bastard in the
press all you want,

26:53.153 --> 26:55.109
just as long
as I stay rich.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.788
Stan is looking for you.
I'm busy.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.743
He said it's urgent.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.960
I don't understand how
it's even possible.
I've checked it twice.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.089
How much?

27:20.180 --> 27:21.260
(SIGHING) Ten cases.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.137
Ten cases?

27:23.225 --> 27:24.761
Going back three years.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.467
What the hell have
you been doing, Stan?

27:26.562 --> 27:28.393
You're supposed
to be managing
this place.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.856
All the paperwork
I signed was correct.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.101
She must have altered
the orders afterwards.

27:32.192 --> 27:35.184
Didn't you ever
cross check it with
the bills that came in?

27:35.279 --> 27:36.519
I delegated it.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.399
To whom?

27:39.658 --> 27:40.898
To Gail.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.279
Well, she seemed perfectly
trustworthy, how was I
supposed to know?

27:43.370 --> 27:45.156
By doing yourjob!
Sorry.

27:45.247 --> 27:47.238
Have you notified the DEA?
The DEA?

27:47.332 --> 27:49.038
Jeez, Stan, hello!

27:49.126 --> 27:52.289
You don't steal $50,000
worth of pills because
you want to lose weight.

27:52.379 --> 27:55.837
She's supplying a meth lab.
Just get her back in here.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.664
All right.
Now.

28:03.307 --> 28:05.514
Well, you ever
want a job, trust me.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.432
He'll double whatever
you're making here.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.020
I take it he liked
my proposal.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.562
Enough to tell me
to get my ass back
over here today.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.812
Here. He's willing
to go to 8%.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.648
Eight?
We were at four.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.730
Your board's gonna think
you walk on water.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.944
lwant 12.

28:26.330 --> 28:29.572
You're not gonna get 12.
There's just no way.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.952
8% barely covers
our cost inflation.

28:32.044 --> 28:35.036
The capitated structure
should allow you to
hold down inflation.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.870
And shifts all
your risk onto us,

28:36.965 --> 28:38.341
which is why
we deserve 12.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.414
Lisa, come on.

28:39.509 --> 28:42.046
The guy who mows
my lawn makes more
than my kid's teacher.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.378
Hell, the two guys
whose lunch you interrupted
could get fired,

28:44.473 --> 28:48.341
their severance would be
more than most of their
employees make in a lifetime.

28:48.435 --> 28:51.677
It doesn't have anything
to do with what you deserve.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.476
This is it.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.564
Take it or leave it.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.699
(SIGHING)

29:28.141 --> 29:29.517
What are you doing?
Hey.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.466
Know any good
transplant surgeons?

29:31.561 --> 29:34.223
Turns out his kidneys
aren't the only
thing failing.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.520
And I know what
you're thinking,

29:35.607 --> 29:38.394
but malaria
wouldn't destroy
his liver that fast,

29:38.485 --> 29:40.897
especially since
we never infected him.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.569
I thought you said...
Apparently Foreman now thinks

29:42.656 --> 29:44.521
that he has the authority
to overrule my orders

29:46.910 --> 29:48.286
Don't worry,
I'll deal with him.

29:48.370 --> 29:50.782
If you could just
talk to Hourani...

29:54.001 --> 29:55.286
What would you do?

29:56.545 --> 29:58.126
If you paged me
during sex?

29:58.213 --> 30:00.875
About the contract
with AtlanticNet?

30:01.800 --> 30:05.543
I got them to come up to 8%,
but we should get at least 12.

30:06.596 --> 30:10.214
It's all numbers,
do the math,
and nothing else.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.388
It's not about my pride,
it's about the principle.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.139
They're trying
to screw us over
because we're small.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.265
That's what they're
supposed to do.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.142
They should be pressuring
other hospitals

30:18.233 --> 30:22.727
to be more like us,
not trying to make us more
like them. It's stupid.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.270
And putting your
job on the line

30:24.364 --> 30:27.231
in an effort to stamp
out stupidity isn't?

30:28.535 --> 30:29.820
You would.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.871
Probably.

30:31.955 --> 30:35.243
But then I also wanted to try
to cure cancer by infecting
a guy with malaria

30:35.334 --> 30:38.701
to win a $50 bet.
You really want
to be like me?

31:07.949 --> 31:11.441
we've been trying to
renegotiate our contract
with AtlanticNet Insurance.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.778
It's been a difficult process,
but I wanted to
let you all know

31:14.873 --> 31:18.411
before we made the formal
announcement, that,
as of 5:00 pm. today,

31:18.502 --> 31:21.369
our contract
with AtlanticNet
will be terminated.

31:21.838 --> 31:22.998
We've doubled the number

31:23.090 --> 31:26.048
of customer service
representatives
in our call center,

31:26.134 --> 31:30.047
current patients will still
be allowed to remain
in our care for 30 days,

31:30.138 --> 31:33.630
but starting tomorrow
we will no longer
be accepting patients

31:33.725 --> 31:36.262
with AtlanticNet
health insurance.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.056
MAN 1: Dr. Cuddy!

31:38.146 --> 31:40.523
(ALL CLAMORING)

31:40.607 --> 31:42.472
MAN 2: Why weren't
we told about
this sooner?

31:48.949 --> 31:51.861
Come on, Marina,
pick up the phone.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.985
I'm busy.

31:58.708 --> 31:59.788
We found a liver match.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.082
All right.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.251
Get him prepped.
I'll straighten things
out with Hourani.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.750
Hourani's not
the problem.
House is.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.627
Now he wants Chase
to do the surgery.

32:07.717 --> 32:09.457
To prove to Hourani
he doesn't need him?

32:09.553 --> 32:12.545
To prove to Thomas
that Chase was his
department's best surgeon.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.717
And what does
Chase want to do?
Chase wants to do the surgery.

32:14.808 --> 32:15.888
And you don't want
him to do it because?

32:15.976 --> 32:17.056
I don't care
who does it.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.133
So what's the problem?

32:18.228 --> 32:19.343
In order to get our
patient into the OR,

32:19.438 --> 32:20.848
we have to get him
on the surgery schedule.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.895
In order to do that
we need someone
to put him there

32:22.983 --> 32:25.190
who neither House
nor Thomas can overrule.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.608
(SIGHING)

32:40.417 --> 32:42.624
What?

32:42.711 --> 32:44.372
Would you rather
I go back on Vicodin?

32:44.463 --> 32:45.794
She's not massaging
yourleg.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.372
She will eventually.

32:48.758 --> 32:52.421
Why am I the only person
here who cares what
happens to this hospital?

32:52.512 --> 32:55.504
Get off your ass
and get your department
under control,

32:55.599 --> 32:57.555
at least for the
next few days.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.303
It's gonna take longer
than a few days

32:59.394 --> 33:01.601
for a company
the size of AtlanticNet

33:01.688 --> 33:04.851
to start feeling the squeeze
of your PR campaign.

33:04.941 --> 33:05.976
If they ever do.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.193
And you know this how?

33:07.277 --> 33:10.235
From all the time you spent
researching them and
their other contracts,

33:10.322 --> 33:11.732
the way they handle
their press relations?

33:11.823 --> 33:13.814
I know they have
a NASCAR team.

33:13.909 --> 33:17.447
Despite what you may
have learned at Hebrew
school or from Jimmy Cliff,

33:17.537 --> 33:21.655
sometimes the bigger they are,
the harder they kick your ass.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.169
ACEVEDO:
I'm not trying
to be greedy.

33:31.259 --> 33:35.468
But he's also not interested
in being forced into
a medical bankruptcy.

33:35.555 --> 33:38.843
Mr. Acevedo, I'm sorry
you're having
financial difficulties,

33:38.934 --> 33:41.391
but because of us
you still have a thumb.

33:41.478 --> 33:43.810
I assume that's something
a carpenter might need.

33:43.897 --> 33:48.687
And I assume you didn't
ask for this meeting so
you could lecture my client.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.313
You have insurance,

33:50.403 --> 33:54.646
but by filing the suit you've
caused us to get paid
nothing by them either.

33:54.741 --> 33:55.776
That's not our problem.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.482
Actually, it is,
since he's responsible

33:57.577 --> 33:59.693
for any expense
we're not reimbursed.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.904
But if you drop this suit
and make it clear

34:01.998 --> 34:04.080
that Dr. Chase
was acting in
your best interest

34:04.167 --> 34:07.079
when he reattached
your thumb, then we'll be
able to resubmit the claim.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.661
And you'll cover
his deductible,
attorney's fees,

34:09.756 --> 34:11.462
and 50 grand for
pain and suffering.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.883
Actually I was thinking
more like we'd cover
half his deductible,

34:14.970 --> 34:18.007
which means you'd
only owe $16,000.

34:18.265 --> 34:20.256
You want him to pay you?
Yes!

34:20.350 --> 34:22.261
Do you have any idea
how much it costs,

34:22.352 --> 34:26.140
how many years
it takes to train someone
in microsurgery?

34:26.231 --> 34:28.392
We gave you back your life.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.938
You can still work,
you can button your own
shirt, hold a fork...

34:32.028 --> 34:33.814
WESTBROOK:
Martin, let's go.

34:34.698 --> 34:39.692
I'm sorry,
I know I should pay,
but I just can't.

34:40.453 --> 34:44.116
I still cannot work,
I'm already under water
on my house,

34:44.207 --> 34:46.619
and I have two kids
with braces.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.451
You think you'd be
in better shape
without a thumb?

34:49.546 --> 34:54.757
Right now, financially?
Yeah, Iwould be.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.960
Well, so would we,
but when you came in,

34:59.055 --> 35:01.888
we didn't think about that,
we just took care of you.

35:01.975 --> 35:04.432
Made sure we did
whatever you needed
to get well.

35:04.519 --> 35:05.599
Yeah, right.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.894
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)
All you doctors care
about is healing.

35:07.981 --> 35:10.393
That's why there are all
those BMWs and Porsches
in the parking lot.

35:10.483 --> 35:11.518
Damn it.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.975
Come on,
we're out of here.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.275
We'll see you in court.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.193
You're right,
you will.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.321
You still have
a thumb because of us,

35:18.408 --> 35:21.320
and like everyone
else in this world,
we don't work for free.

35:21.411 --> 35:25.745
We earn this money, and
if we have to take
your house to get it, we will.

35:32.714 --> 35:33.794
What's going on?

35:33.882 --> 35:34.962
I think
they're fighting.

35:35.842 --> 35:38.333
CUDDY: Out of my way.
Now! Out of the way!

35:38.762 --> 35:40.844
(BOTH GRUNTING)

35:40.930 --> 35:42.795
What the hell
is going on?

35:42.891 --> 35:45.678
I told them to use
their words, but...

35:46.061 --> 35:47.676
(CUDDY WHISTLING)

35:54.944 --> 35:57.902
That pharm tech is back.
She's in your office.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.230
You, there.
You, over there.

36:00.325 --> 36:04.068
I don't want to hear
a word out of either one
of you until I get back.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.162
You lied.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.831
So? What are you
gonna do about it?

36:12.170 --> 36:15.378
Well, for one,
notify the DEA.

36:15.465 --> 36:17.581
Good, I'm sure
they'll be very
interested to hear

36:17.676 --> 36:20.463
how Dr. House forced me
to help him steal the meds

36:20.553 --> 36:24.592
and the administrator who
he's having sex with has
been helping him cover it up.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.553
You really think you can
lie your way out of this?

36:27.644 --> 36:29.555
Yeah, I do.

36:29.646 --> 36:32.308
Anything else you
want to know, bitch?

36:41.157 --> 36:42.693
The hospital board's
chairman wants
to speak to you.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.320
Tell him I'm busy.
I did, but he...

36:44.411 --> 36:46.322
Then tell him I quit.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.773
(SIGHING)

37:26.077 --> 37:27.942
You owe Lucas the money.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.537
We were having sex
when you called.

37:36.838 --> 37:41.298
The breast milk guy finally
found a doctor who'd give
him what he wanted.

37:41.384 --> 37:44.467
If it works, that's way
better than malaria.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.054
It's worth a shot.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.222
Great.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.813
I thought they
were the ones bluffing.

37:58.485 --> 38:01.318
No way they'd
let us terminate.

38:04.324 --> 38:08.408
They're not gonna fire you,
and you're not gonna quit.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.161
Why not?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.082
Because you're an idiot.

38:17.295 --> 38:20.583
This place needs you,
and that matters to you.

38:20.673 --> 38:22.254
(SIGHING)

38:27.806 --> 38:30.798
What do you think
of that pharm tech, Gail?

38:30.892 --> 38:32.132
She's a sociopath.

38:32.227 --> 38:33.512
You knew she was
stealing meds?

38:33.603 --> 38:37.596
No. But have
you seen the way
she opens the mail?

38:38.399 --> 38:41.106
Why didn't you
ever tell me?

38:41.194 --> 38:43.276
Figured it might
come in handy one day.

38:55.583 --> 38:58.416
Gail, I like you.
I always have.

38:58.586 --> 39:01.498
And I know you must've
gotten sucked up
into a situation

39:01.589 --> 39:03.125
you weren't able to control.

39:03.216 --> 39:06.253
Really? Is that
what happened
with you and House?

39:06.719 --> 39:10.086
I'm not gonna back down
just because you
threaten to smear me.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.305
Now, if you agree
to tell the truth,

39:13.393 --> 39:16.100
there are things
I can do to help.

39:16.563 --> 39:19.600
Think about your
husband, your kids.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.896
I know you're
a good person,
deep down inside.

39:24.153 --> 39:28.522
You can't completely hide
everything about yourself
in seven years.

39:30.118 --> 39:31.449
(EXHALING)

39:32.203 --> 39:33.943
You're an idiot.

39:34.414 --> 39:38.248
I started stealing
from here six months
after you hired me.

39:39.043 --> 39:42.501
You still don't even
know the half of it,
and you never will.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.547
You wouldn't have even
found out about this
if I hadn't gotten sick.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.670
And you aren't as tough
as you think you are.

39:48.761 --> 39:52.128
There's no way
you'd let this job
get taken away.

39:52.640 --> 39:56.553
And if I go down,
you're going down.

40:11.659 --> 40:16.323
Hey, can you tell Stan
to give this to the DEA
agent when he comes by?

40:16.623 --> 40:17.703
A flower?

40:17.790 --> 40:18.916
Yeah,
Lucas gave it to me.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.831
Thought it might come
in handy one day.

40:20.919 --> 40:24.787
GAIL: / started stealing
from here six months
after you hired me.

40:24.881 --> 40:26.837
Nice.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.166
Least I came out
on top once today.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.636
Where you going?

40:30.720 --> 40:33.211
To hand the board
my resignation.

40:33.514 --> 40:37.302
Hopefully whoever
they hire to replace me
can still get the 8%.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.223
(BEEPING)

40:42.106 --> 40:45.940
Marina, I've been
trying to get in
touch with you all day.

40:48.154 --> 40:51.362
It's all right.
I understand.
How is Rachel?

40:52.241 --> 40:53.902
And the rash?

40:54.911 --> 40:57.197
Great. I'll be home early.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.787
(GROANS)

41:00.041 --> 41:01.372
Perfect.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.580
MORGAN: You bitch.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.956
I didn't think
you'd actually do it.

41:10.051 --> 41:11.257
I told you I would.

41:12.512 --> 41:14.298
Call the dogs off.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.181
You got your 12.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.143
Congratulations.

41:27.527 --> 41:29.859
Yes!

41:30.738 --> 41:32.069
(WHOOPING)

41:32.615 --> 41:33.821
Yes!

You gonna get that?
