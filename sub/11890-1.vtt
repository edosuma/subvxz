come in on the feeds?

13:15.212 --> 13:17.422

Hi, Adam.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.274
Hey.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.948
I brought you something.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.074
Oh...

24:10.199 --> 24:12.743
It's a birthday present,

24:12.869 --> 24:15.455
but you dumped me before I had
the chance to give it to you.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.915
Well, that's not really what
happened, but thank you.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.208
It's a robe.

24:19.292 --> 24:20.793
Surprise!

24:22.712 --> 24:26.299
I figured you could use something
up here to keep you warm.

24:26.382 --> 24:27.425
Absolutely.

24:27.550 --> 24:30.553
No. Thank you, this is
really sweet of you. Thanks.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.559
So, what's your plan?

24:36.893 --> 24:38.186
Stop the Inupiats.

24:38.269 --> 24:39.312
Mmm-hmm.

24:39.395 --> 24:43.316
Use the media to show the world
what heartless hunters they are.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.068
Adam?
What?

24:46.152 --> 24:47.737
Are you even listening to me?

24:47.904 --> 24:50.156
Yes. Yes, I definitely am.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.908
You know, the Inupiats
are very good people.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.117
They're killers, Adam.

24:53.659 --> 24:57.914
And I'm the only thing standing between
those whales and their harpoons.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.081
But when I'm done,

24:59.165 --> 25:02.585
the press is gonna want to
hang them from the rafters.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.254

25:20.269 --> 25:21.270
Yep.

25:21.604 --> 25:22.605
Yes.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.524

Okay, can I help
whoever is next?

25:35.368 --> 25:37.036
Right here.
I have cash.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.538
This machine was built in 1970.

25:38.621 --> 25:39.664
Prudhoe Bay, Alaska

25:39.789 --> 25:40.873
The next year it enters
the record books,

25:40.957 --> 25:43.501
making an ascent
straight up to 36,000 feet

25:43.626 --> 25:44.669
in under six minutes.

25:44.794 --> 25:48.464
That's a faster climb rate
than an F-14 Tomcat.

25:48.548 --> 25:50.007
So, my old girl here
and her sister

25:50.132 --> 25:52.343
will be pulling 75,000
pounds of hover barge

25:52.468 --> 25:55.805
from here all the way to those three
whales stuck off Point Barrow.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.432
Now, the hover barge
is 40 by 60 feet.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.351
We have jet-fueled turbines.

26:00.476 --> 26:04.021
These massive engines create
a cushion of air right here,

26:04.146 --> 26:05.565
underneath the barge.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.316
And this causes the hover barge

26:07.400 --> 26:09.527
to liftoff
the ground four feet,

26:09.652 --> 26:13.030
enabling us to move at will,
pulverizing any ice in our path.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.198
How long do you...

26:14.323 --> 26:16.534
I'm sorry, we're going to get back
to work now, if you don't mind.

would drag me up to the beach,"

Yeah, but Pebbles
was also a girl. So...

No, and no one is
going to go down there.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.028
Why not?

37:18.111 --> 37:21.156

10,000-pound killer whales

37:21.240 --> 37:23.575

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.379
No one does.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:58.132
And no one would
watch them even if we did.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:03.095
Do you know that there are
at least 30 wars going on

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.763
around the world, as we speak?

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:06.306
Yeah.
Of course you don't.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.392
Because there are no reporters
there to tell you about them

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:12.229
because they're all here
covering three stupid whales!

01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:16.984
Look at what
they've done to me.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:21.113
I'm just a smelly, drunk,

01:02:22.281 --> 01:02:26.326
depressed Barbie.

01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:28.328
No, no,
of course not. You...

01:02:28.454 --> 01:02:29.496
Do you know what?

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:31.749
Maybe this is
my wake-up call.

01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:32.916
Okay.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.837
If this is what
reporting is all about,

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:39.506
I don't want any part of it.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.300
What would you do?

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:45.929
I don't know.
Maybe be a teacher.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:49.808
<i>Adam, it's Rachel. Come in.</i>

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:51.351
Hey, Rachel,
can you give me a second?

01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:52.853
I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.689
<i>Adam, we need a generator!</i>

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:58.358
<i>There's got to be
one at your station.</i>

01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:01.862
<i>If we don't get it in the next few
minutes, the whales are dead.</i>

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:03.864
<i>Now, start it up inside</i>

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:07.201
<i>and keep it running until
you get to the SAR hangar.</i>

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:08.702
<i>Adam, do you roger that?</i>

01:03:08.786 --> 01:03:10.454
Yeah, I got it.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.372
I'm just saying, grab a
camera and some equipment

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:13.540
while you're in there.

01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:15.459
It'll take two seconds. I
need you to be my cameraman.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.044
Jill, this is about the whales.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.545
And, by the way, what happened
to your wake-up call?

01:03:18.629 --> 01:03:20.714
Five minutes ago, you were
going to be a school teacher.

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:22.966
Since things have
slowed with the rescue...

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:24.384
You're no different than I am.

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:26.720
You want to move
up just as badly.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:28.555
This story is our chance, Adam.

01:03:28.639 --> 01:03:32.559
It fell into your lap, but it
landed you on national television!

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:34.895
What's happening out there
on the ice right now, Adam,

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.146
that's our story.

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:37.981
No, it's everyone's story.

01:03:38.065 --> 01:03:41.735
Do you think that if they had the
scoop, they would give it to you?

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:44.571
We are being handed the ticket
to where we both want to go.

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:46.740
Don't throw it away.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.328
The people will spend the next
two months in total darkness.

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:53.580
What happened?
What the hell?

01:04:00.254 --> 01:04:01.421
Okay.

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:07.928
No way! There's about a million
FAA regs against that.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:09.263
Shut it off, or we don't go.

01:04:09.388 --> 01:04:11.265
It'll freeze.
This is the only way.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.601
Pat! We'll all be unconscious
in five minutes.

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:16.186
That's not what you
want from your pilot.

01:04:18.272 --> 01:04:22.901
What if we just leave all the doors
open and let all the air out?

01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:24.778
You're joking, right?

01:04:28.866 --> 01:04:29.908
Fine!

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:35.539
But there's a pretty good chance
we're going to freeze to death.

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:58.061
Seventy below?
That can't be right.

01:04:59.897 --> 01:05:00.981
Feels pretty right.

01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:02.649
But wait,
if we're going 100 knots,

01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:04.651
then that makes our
wind chill at about...

going to get electrocuted?

My absolute favorite whale
is the mommy, Wilma,

01:09:28.874 --> 01:09:33.086
because she's a gentle mommy that loves
and cares for her cute little baby.

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:35.755
And that must mean
she has a big heart.

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:38.091
She also has big lungs.

she can stay underwater.

you tell the President

how badly the rescue was
going when he called?

01:40:26.771 --> 01:40:29.774
<i>of a 40-year cold war
beginning to thaw.</i>

01:40:29.899 --> 01:40:31.609
<i>So, all this is
rather interesting.</i>

01:40:31.818 --> 01:40:34.779
<i>When you've seen
these magnificent animals</i>

01:40:34.904 --> 01:40:36.823
<i>up close like I have, Larry,</i>

01:40:36.990 --> 01:40:41.911
<i>you come to know that
indomitable American spirit</i>

01:40:41.995 --> 01:40:43.079
<i>that lives within them.</i>

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:45.415
<i>Thanks very much
for joining us tonight.</i>

01:40:45.498 --> 01:40:47.167
<i>We'll be back
with Arsenio Hall.</i>

01:40:47.667 --> 01:40:49.919
<i>Ice is freezing
the Beaufort Sea</i>

01:40:50.003 --> 01:40:52.338
<i>more quickly than usual
for this time of year.</i>

01:40:52.464 --> 01:40:55.592
<i>And three gray whales,
two adults and their baby,</i>

01:40:55.675 --> 01:40:59.304
<i>are now trapped in walls
of ice, six inches thick.</i>

01:40:59.471 --> 01:41:02.098
<i>And I'll be back
with an exclusive report.</i>

01:41:09.939 --> 01:41:13.151
<i>Time is running out for the whales
trapped in the ice in Alaska...</i>
