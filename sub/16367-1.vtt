00:25.692 --> 00:27.192
Good evening.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.594
I'm Helen Mirren,

00:28.596 --> 00:33.065
and you're watching
"Documentary Now" season 51.

00:33.067 --> 00:36.168
In 1992,
filmmaker RC Baumgartner

00:36.170 --> 00:40.973
set out for Ohio to chronicle
a gubernatorial campaign.

00:40.975 --> 00:44.143
While the intended focus
was the candidates,

00:44.145 --> 00:47.479
it soon shifted
to those behind the scenes.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.883
Through Baumgartner's lens,
the world was introduced

00:50.885 --> 00:54.253
to political operators
Teddy Redbones

00:54.255 --> 00:55.721
and Alvin Panagoulious

00:55.723 --> 00:59.725
in the campaign classic,
"The Bunker."

02:10.798 --> 02:12.264
That's right.

02:12.266 --> 02:17.236
As a former councilman,
I care very much about Ohio.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.171
Yes.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.806
And I think it's important
to run

02:20.808 --> 02:24.009
and give Ohioans a choice.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.844
That's right.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.080
I run as a...

02:28.082 --> 02:31.350
as a kindness,
you might say.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.985
Okay.

02:32.987 --> 02:36.088
Well, you have
a good afternoon

02:36.090 --> 02:38.624
and then a good night.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.727
Now, that is fun.

02:41.729 --> 02:45.164
Talking on the telephone
to reporters.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.733
Hey, listen to this.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.268
"Modest though he is,

02:49.270 --> 02:51.303
"Ben Herndon yesterday
handed his campaign

02:51.305 --> 02:54.173
"over to a rogue's gallery
of political gurus

02:54.175 --> 02:55.941
"including Teddy Redbones,

02:55.943 --> 02:58.377
"the so-called
Mississippi Machiavelli,

02:58.379 --> 03:00.946
and Alvin Panagoulious,
the boy-hunk..."

03:00.948 --> 03:02.614
"...of the Beltway."

03:02.616 --> 03:04.883
You think I'm a cute hunk?

03:04.885 --> 03:06.218
I feel like I'm shy.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.953
No, they always write
the same stuff about me.

03:07.955 --> 03:12.925
A Mississippi Machiavelli
or Sunburnt Succubus or...

03:12.927 --> 03:14.459
What's the other one?
Suspected arsonist.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.228
Yeah?

03:16.230 --> 03:19.031
But... You know
what they always leave out?

03:19.033 --> 03:21.200
Undefeated.
That's right.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.334
Undefeated.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.403
Did you fellas forget
to take your shoes off?

03:24.405 --> 03:25.904
Oh, sorry.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.139
Apologies.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.013
I mean, my goal is
to have an office

03:35.015 --> 03:37.216
that just has a lot
of open communication,

03:37.218 --> 03:39.551
so any messages
for the candidate

03:39.553 --> 03:40.986
can go through me.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.888
If there are any phone calls
for the candidate,

03:42.890 --> 03:44.356
this all goes through me.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.191
Everything's streamlined
so it goes through me.

03:46.193 --> 03:49.795
Just faster that way,
and...

03:49.797 --> 03:51.663
I don't know who put these up,

03:51.665 --> 03:54.766
but this one is a nine,

03:54.768 --> 03:56.535
and this wall should be
all tens.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.870
You know, blondes, brunettes.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.672
Tasteful.
Just tens.

04:00.674 --> 04:04.276
It's a little thing but it
just affects everything, so...

04:04.278 --> 04:07.346
- Okay.
- All right, thanks.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.881
And let's please make sure
on all the flyers

04:09.883 --> 04:11.683
that the name
is spelled correctly.

04:11.685 --> 04:15.153
It's H-E-R-N-D-O-N, Herndon.

04:15.155 --> 04:18.322
And now let's hear from the man
of the campaign, Mr...

04:18.325 --> 04:19.825
Get out of my way.
Out of my way.

04:19.827 --> 04:20.826
- Teddy Redbones.
- Get out of my way.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.830
Let me tell you what this
election's about, okay?

04:24.832 --> 04:29.034
Let me tell you why I wake up
at 4:30 in the morning so angry.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.637
Because Governor Lester
with his head of hair

04:31.639 --> 04:33.905
and his perfect suits
and his "jogging,"

04:33.907 --> 04:35.140
well, he thinks he's got

04:35.142 --> 04:38.410
this re-election in the bag,
right?

04:38.412 --> 04:40.078
What, because our guy
ain't James Dean?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.580
Well, let me tell you something.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.483
We've all been the most
unpopular guy in the room.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.118
Yeah?

04:46.120 --> 04:48.020
We've all been the person
at the wedding

04:48.022 --> 04:52.257
no one wants to speak to
during passed appetizers, yeah?

04:52.259 --> 04:54.293
And now we're up
against Mr. Popular.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.494
Okay?

04:55.496 --> 04:58.864
Governor Lester with his...
his perfect record

04:58.866 --> 05:01.867
and his money
and his $10 family,

05:01.869 --> 05:03.235
well, let me tell you something.

05:03.237 --> 05:06.271
Even the shiniest,
most beautiful apple

05:06.273 --> 05:09.274
has something mushy
and brown underneath.

05:09.276 --> 05:13.145
Now, we got to find
whatever weird, mushy brownness

05:13.147 --> 05:15.080
we can on Governor Lester,
all right?

05:15.082 --> 05:18.216
So let's get this goin'.
Come on.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.485
So I guess the question is,
how do you get excited

05:20.487 --> 05:23.755
about a candidate
who says he is only running

05:23.757 --> 05:25.924
as a "kindness to the voters,"

05:25.926 --> 05:27.459
and who has
publicly praised

05:27.461 --> 05:29.194
Governor Lester's
first term in office?

05:29.196 --> 05:32.364
He praised it publicly,
exactly, to be nice.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.566
It's kind of like when you meet
someone's wife

05:34.568 --> 05:37.502
and you say she's a ten
when really she's a true five.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.137
I mean, I don't think
I'm speaking out of turn

05:39.139 --> 05:41.273
when I say that.
We all do that.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.041
And that's
your political strategy?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.409
Rating women?

05:45.412 --> 05:49.014
You could see it that way.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.382
Okay.
Okay.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.718
I'm Luanne Maltley
with "Politics Now."

05:52.720 --> 05:53.719
We'll be right back.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.454
I think it went very well.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.689
I understand that you're new
to our style,

05:57.691 --> 06:00.792
but it's very effective,
I assure you.

06:00.794 --> 06:01.727
Don't worry.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.028
Not gonna do anything

06:03.030 --> 06:04.296
that makes you feel
uncomfortable.

06:04.298 --> 06:07.466
Jackass alert right here.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.735
"Re-elect Lester."

06:09.737 --> 06:11.436
All right, hold up.

06:18.911 --> 06:20.045
A lawn jockey?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.513
It's 1992.

06:21.515 --> 06:26.351
What kind of people are
th-these Lester supporters?

06:26.353 --> 06:28.086
Our man's a little nervous
about our tactics,

06:28.088 --> 06:30.555
but he just needs to see that
we've got it under control.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.357
Yeah, I'm not worried
about our man.

06:32.359 --> 06:35.093
No, what
I'm worried about is...

06:35.095 --> 06:37.529
we don't have any
honest-to-God dirt

06:37.531 --> 06:39.731
on Governor Lester.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.100
Here's another one.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.568
It's why I love Ohio,

07:16.570 --> 07:21.573
because you can't say it
without saying, "Oh, hi."

07:21.575 --> 07:24.543
And I want to say "Oh, hi"
to all the voters

07:24.545 --> 07:27.078
on election day.

07:27.080 --> 07:31.283
And maybe the voters
would like a change.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.485
We have had a lot
of Governor Lester

07:33.487 --> 07:36.421
and his cronies
in the toll authority.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.857
That's right, you go
for the jugular, fat man.

07:38.859 --> 07:42.294
I appreciate your support
and thank you all for being here

07:42.296 --> 07:45.464
and... let's...
let's win this thing.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.532
Thank you.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.201
Thank you.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.044
Is that my jacket?

07:59.046 --> 08:01.446
It's the room's jacket.

08:01.448 --> 08:06.218
Our man's a little nervous
that the new TV ad is negative.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.519
We have it?

08:07.521 --> 08:09.020
Mary Beth, we have it?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.155
Put it in.
Let's see it.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.156
Come on.
Let's go.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.761
This Sunday is
Governor Lester's birthday.

08:16.763 --> 08:17.863
Let's hope...

08:18.866 --> 08:21.700
It's his last.

08:25.672 --> 08:29.541
On election day
vote for Ben Herndon.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.843
Okay, our biggest problem,
as usual, is time,

08:31.845 --> 08:33.678
so this is running 18 seconds.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.113
Local TV will run it
twice as long

08:35.115 --> 08:36.481
if we get it done at 11.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.750
Now can we add kids
singing "Happy Birthday"

08:38.751 --> 08:40.919
all spooky-like?

08:40.921 --> 08:42.587
That will just add more time.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.089
Right.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.657
Am I the only one
that's concerned

08:45.659 --> 08:46.658
that this spot plays

08:46.660 --> 08:50.462
like we want Governor Lester
to die?

08:50.464 --> 08:51.830
I don't understand.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.164
W...
Walk me through that.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.733
I feel like you're saying,

08:54.735 --> 08:57.035
"We hope it's
your last birthday."

08:57.037 --> 08:59.137
In office.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.072
We hope that Governor Lester
will celebrate

09:01.074 --> 09:02.741
his last birthday in office

09:02.743 --> 09:05.911
because we've got the right guy
with the right ideas

09:05.913 --> 09:07.345
who loves his state.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.513
We're not only saying...

09:08.515 --> 09:09.514
"Happy birthday,
Governor Lester."

09:09.516 --> 09:10.582
We're also saying,

09:10.584 --> 09:12.183
"Hope you don't have to work

09:12.185 --> 09:13.585
on your birthday next year."

09:13.587 --> 09:15.887
I mean, it's two different types
of nice.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.255
It's a death threat.

09:17.257 --> 09:21.459
It's clear,
it's a death threat.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.461
I know how we can shave off
five seconds.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.396
Go.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.997
What if we take out

09:25.999 --> 09:28.366
"This election,
vote for Ben Herndon?"

09:28.368 --> 09:30.035
Yes, just say,
"Hope it's your last."

09:30.037 --> 09:32.404
Cut to spooky kids singing,
"Happy birthday."

09:32.406 --> 09:35.707
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

09:35.709 --> 09:36.841
Spooky as shit.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.843
Freeze frame,
x-ray on the photo.

09:38.845 --> 09:41.146
Okay, you just added
15 more seconds.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.647
Goddamn it, Mary Beth.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.683
In one hour I got to go meet
with a forger

09:44.685 --> 09:46.318
to try to change
Governor Lester's

09:46.320 --> 09:48.219
high school yearbook quote,
you understand?

09:48.221 --> 09:49.721
So I've got to be able
to leave here

09:49.723 --> 09:52.524
knowing that this ad plays
without you coming

09:52.526 --> 09:55.260
and pinching out the waist
about ten seconds.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.361
Okay?

09:56.363 --> 09:57.862
I can't work like that.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.364
I trust you.
It'll be okay.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.398
Figure it out!

10:10.577 --> 10:12.410
Mr. Redbones,
"The Cleveland Plain Dealer"

10:12.412 --> 10:13.511
wrote today
that Herndon is

10:13.513 --> 10:15.447
"wildly unfit to be governor."

10:15.449 --> 10:17.148
Okay, well, first,
"The Cleveland Plain Dealer's"

10:17.150 --> 10:18.717
a terrible name for a newspaper.

10:18.719 --> 10:21.186
Man, it sounds
like a boring blackjack dealer.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.454
I mean, I like
my blackjack dealers

10:22.456 --> 10:24.289
to be celebrity impersonators,
and...

10:24.291 --> 10:26.091
and while we're talking about
gambling,

10:26.093 --> 10:28.793
I mean, Governor Lester...
you know,

10:28.795 --> 10:32.197
he's never publicly come out
against riverboat gambling

10:32.199 --> 10:35.300
between...
Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.735
So I mean, ask yourselves that.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.637
We could have ourselves
a gambling addict in the...

10:38.639 --> 10:41.006
in the governor's mansion.

10:42.775 --> 10:44.242
Y'all are barking up
the wrong dirt tree.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.581
I want to write a story

10:49.583 --> 10:51.182
that Herndon failed
basic economics

10:51.184 --> 10:53.051
in community college five times

10:53.053 --> 10:55.387
because we're gonna win.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.656
We're young, we're cute.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.491
You don't want to be the guy
who bet against us.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.825
You want to be the guy

11:00.827 --> 11:02.694
who went to high school
with Kathy Ireland?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.729
And you ignored her
because she was mousy-looking

11:04.731 --> 11:07.065
and then years later
she's on the cover

11:07.067 --> 11:08.600
of "Sports Illustrated?"

11:08.602 --> 11:11.202
How's that gonna feel?

11:11.204 --> 11:13.004
You don't want to be that guy.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.072
All right, now, listen up.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.507
We're exactly one week away

11:15.509 --> 11:16.908
from the only important debate

11:16.910 --> 11:18.410
of this entire election.

11:18.412 --> 11:19.944
I need some dirt
on Governor Lester, all right?

11:19.946 --> 11:21.212
And I'm not talking
about mudslinging.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.747
Something real.

11:22.749 --> 11:25.517
What about that intern hours
thing we talked about?

11:25.519 --> 11:27.419
Remind me, what is that again?

11:27.421 --> 11:28.486
That's we have
the news footage

11:28.488 --> 11:29.721
from Lester's headquarters.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.089
Got interns.
They're working.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.557
Not only on holidays

11:32.559 --> 11:34.993
but also more than five hours
on a business day.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.227
These are unpaid workers so...

11:36.229 --> 11:37.762
So he's got slaves?

11:37.764 --> 11:39.330
No, these are interns.
It's fine to have interns.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.732
Alvin.
Alvin.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.967
We got footage of Lester
using slaves.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.804
No, no, no. These are interns.
They're kids.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.639
Child slaves.
That's even better.

11:47.641 --> 11:49.374
- That's great.
- Child slaves.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.643
I want a press conference,
that's what I want.

11:51.645 --> 11:52.744
Tell Mary Beth
we want press conference.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.279
You're signing off on this?

11:54.281 --> 11:55.680
I'm signing off on...
We're both signing off on it.

11:55.682 --> 11:56.748
What do you mean,
we sign off on it?

11:56.750 --> 11:58.316
We're both signing off.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.785
Don't with us, Mark.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.322
Sign off on it.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.759
No, but Ben, it will absolutely
dominate the airwaves tomorrow

12:07.761 --> 12:10.829
if we hit them
with this today.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.498
Yeah, but sir,
here's what makes me nervous.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.201
We've got nothing
going into the debate.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.536
Nothing that pops.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.772
I'm sure you picked
a nice suit out.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.274
That's...

12:23.276 --> 12:24.676
Okay.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.412
It's a no-go.

12:31.550 --> 12:32.851
What does he want from us?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.085
I mean, he just can't
wrap his head

12:34.087 --> 12:35.854
around any kind of negativity.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.823
It's what... I never...
We've never had zilch, nothing.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.126
Nothing at this late
in the game, I mean...

12:41.128 --> 12:44.195
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, Teddy.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.930
What is it?

12:52.539 --> 12:53.538
Got something, boss.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.539
Once again,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.407
this is a shoes-off house.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.408
Yeah, not gonna happen.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.877
Look, we got legit evidence

12:58.879 --> 13:01.846
that Lester had a child
with his college girlfriend

13:01.848 --> 13:03.348
and he's never admitted to it.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.582
- Look at this. Look at this.
- What?

13:04.584 --> 13:07.986
It's true.
It's all true.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.921
- And he abandoned the child?
- Yes.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.890
Well, technically he didn't
and he's never mentioned it.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.792
I mean, he does pay
child support

13:13.794 --> 13:15.727
and apparently they have
a good relationship...

13:15.729 --> 13:17.829
The point is
he's a liar, okay?

13:17.831 --> 13:20.098
He's lied time and time again
about how many children he has...

13:20.100 --> 13:23.735
Oh, man.
Well, now this raises questions.

13:23.737 --> 13:25.069
Yes, yes, it does raise
some questions

13:25.071 --> 13:26.905
we're gonna raise
in the debate tomorrow.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.206
Oh, no...

13:28.208 --> 13:30.809
Yes, yes, the people of Ohio
deserve to know...

13:30.811 --> 13:32.177
You got to
take the reins on this.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.678
Who they're gonna
pick for governor.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.380
They need to know the truth.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.382
Okay.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.383
Okay, I will do it.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.484
You'll do it?

13:39.486 --> 13:40.852
Right,
we'll see you tomorrow.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.587
Wait.
I got to go take a dump.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.956
- Where's your commode at?
- No, don't... wait...

13:44.958 --> 13:47.458
Wipe up.
Shit.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.233
I've been working on a...
a Herndon impression.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.467
- You guys want to see it?
- Yeah.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.602
You can't tell him.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.504
He's always so nervous.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.172
"Well, I...

14:01.174 --> 14:04.075
Alvin.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.143
I think I'm nervous."

14:06.479 --> 14:08.079
You think you're nervous?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.581
Yeah, if you think you're
nervous, you are nervous.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.351
Put the taffy down,
Tubby Tammy.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.519
Yeah, this one works good.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.855
I like it.

14:16.857 --> 14:20.058
Put the taffy down, Tubby Tammy.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.026
This one works.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.595
You guys want to see
the King of Pop?

14:23.597 --> 14:25.964
- Yeah, do it.
- All right, I'll do it.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.335
Shamone!

14:33.640 --> 14:34.639
Boss, which one you want?

14:34.641 --> 14:35.874
I want the colorful one.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.342
I like the one
that makes me stand out.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.611
Let me see it.
Let me see it.

14:46.185 --> 14:48.653
Boss.
Boss.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.127
Right?

15:01.400 --> 15:06.471
Tonight, the 1992 Ohio state
gubernatorial debate,

15:06.473 --> 15:08.239
with current governor
Tom Lester

15:08.241 --> 15:12.010
facing off against
former councilman Ben Herndon.

15:12.012 --> 15:16.781
And now, your debate
moderator, Rhonda Lawndes.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.416
Live from
Civic Center,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.786
the 1992
Ohio gubernatorial debate.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.122
Tonight is the night, Alvie.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.791
The tide is gonna change.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.393
I have prayed on it,

15:28.395 --> 15:29.827
and I cannot engage

15:29.829 --> 15:32.597
in this kind of attack.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.599
Well...
Do you want to lose the race?

15:34.601 --> 15:35.967
Is that what you want to do?

15:35.969 --> 15:38.303
If I do this,
how will I sleep at night?

15:38.305 --> 15:41.372
Y-you drink and you take pills
like everybody else.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.641
I believe in forgiveness.

15:43.643 --> 15:48.246
And I am not sure what you two
believe in except yourselves.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.481
I want you off my campaign.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.216
Now if you will excuse me,

15:52.218 --> 15:54.552
I'm going to have
an honest debate.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.354
Thanks for all your help.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.655
Thanks for having me on.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.724
Yes, it's a lot of work.

15:59.726 --> 16:00.925
- Yeah.
- Not for us.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.627
- No, no, for Mr. Herndon.
- Right.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.796
Please welcome
Governor Tom Lester.

16:10.836 --> 16:15.173
And former councilman
and grandfather Ben Herndon.

16:19.611 --> 16:23.781
That's the governor.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.717
It's okay.
It's all right.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.785
With Ohio's economy
having a surplus

16:27.787 --> 16:29.754
for the first time
in a generation,

16:29.756 --> 16:33.057
how would you continue
economic momentum?

16:33.059 --> 16:35.660
Well that's a...
a good question.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.629
And I would like
to answer it tomorrow,

16:38.631 --> 16:41.466
and also I'm out of water.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.067
I have water for you.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.079
We're gonna lose
this election.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.682
No, no, no, we're ain't
gonna lose this election.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.917
Come here.

16:59.919 --> 17:03.121
Remeber what I told you I'd do
before I lose an election?

17:03.123 --> 17:06.057
Oh, yes,
that was crazy.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.659
Should I do it?

17:09.595 --> 17:10.728
Yeah.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.130
- Yeah.
- You should do it.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.998
Yeah.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.901
Although I think my opponent
would make

17:16.903 --> 17:19.237
a great grandfather
of the year,

17:19.239 --> 17:22.106
I think I'd make
a better governor.

17:27.946 --> 17:30.415
Teddy Redbones's been shot!

17:30.417 --> 17:31.883
They shot me!

17:31.885 --> 17:34.252
Someone on Lester's campaign
shot me!

17:35.288 --> 17:36.521
Oh, man, that hurt.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.274
That's what I'm saying.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.609
So Cleveland, Youngstown,
Columbus,

17:58.611 --> 18:01.813
and all the southern districts
are in.

18:01.815 --> 18:04.749
Well, we're waiting on that,
but I don't think it matters.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.917
We got this.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.786
It's ours.

18:08.788 --> 18:12.957
Congratulations, Mr. Governor.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.260
We won.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.998
We won!

18:21.000 --> 18:21.833
Yeah!

18:30.042 --> 18:32.877
If you don't mind,

18:32.879 --> 18:35.947
I'd like to say...
a few things.

18:35.949 --> 18:39.350
There are three things
that I'm grateful for

18:39.352 --> 18:41.853
at this moment.

18:41.855 --> 18:46.257
The first is the way
we ran this campaign.

18:48.061 --> 18:51.429
I'm proud of everyone
in this room.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.865
The second thing,

18:53.867 --> 18:56.734
I recently met someone

18:56.736 --> 18:59.403
and I...
I am just giddy.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.038
It's in that early phase
where just...

19:01.040 --> 19:04.175
everything is exciting.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.176
Anything.

19:05.178 --> 19:08.179
Holding hands,
seeing each other,

19:08.181 --> 19:10.414
just walking into the same room.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.553
Third thing

19:15.555 --> 19:17.421
is that I am proud and grateful

19:17.423 --> 19:19.056
for this man right here.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.333
Shut up.
Shut up.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.503
Shut up.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.740
I'm gonna cry now.

19:35.742 --> 19:39.477
It's gonna be a weird cry.

19:39.479 --> 19:44.215
This all started with a bet
in a restaurant, that right?

19:44.217 --> 19:48.386
A bet that we could get anyone
elected to anything.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.325
And we did.

19:54.327 --> 19:57.628
This was never
about the state of Ohio

19:57.630 --> 20:00.031
or Ben...

20:00.033 --> 20:03.901
- Herndon.
- Herndon.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.304
It's about what we did.

20:11.276 --> 20:15.880
We changed the way that election
narratives are hijacked.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.818
Y'all are
political professionals.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.021
You should
be proud of that.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.390
I'm proud of you.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.995
You love your work,

20:30.997 --> 20:32.597
and you learned a lot.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.266
We all learned a lot.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.401
Like the difference between
shooting someone in their ass

20:37.403 --> 20:38.803
and shooting them
in their femur,

20:38.805 --> 20:40.338
ain't that right,
Mary Beth?

20:41.307 --> 20:42.807
You should have seen her
out there.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.442
She went,
"Ahh!"

20:44.444 --> 20:46.844
It was like Wile E. Coyote
down there.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.179
You dumb knuckle head.

20:48.181 --> 20:49.180
Anyway, give yourself.
Come on.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.321
Thank you.

20:57.323 --> 21:00.024
I just heard
from Governor Lester

21:00.026 --> 21:01.859
who offers his congratulations.

21:04.163 --> 21:07.198
I cannot believe I am governor.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.937
I should say now,

21:12.939 --> 21:16.173
we have a
family cruise planned in October

21:16.175 --> 21:17.875
for my aunt's
80th birthday,

21:17.877 --> 21:21.946
so I will be gone
for three weeks

21:21.948 --> 21:23.581
for the cruise.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.384
I hope that's okay.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.785
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.453
Thank you for your support.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.621
Thank you for your vote.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.689
Thank you.
