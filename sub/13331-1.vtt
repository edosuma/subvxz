WEBVTT

00:07.574 --> 00:10.176
Geordie Shore is back!

00:10.243 --> 00:12.479
Last time was mint.
Two new housemates.

00:12.545 --> 00:13.747
Alreet?

00:13.813 --> 00:15.648
We caused havoc.

00:15.715 --> 00:18.518
There was ups, downs.
I'd like to shit in his face.

00:19.252 --> 00:22.389
Last time the Buck Squad dominated.

00:22.455 --> 00:24.657
Where's the fucking fanny?

00:24.724 --> 00:26.860
I ended up banging Scott...
(moans)

00:26.926 --> 00:29.362
And realised
I had feelings for James.

00:29.429 --> 00:32.499
I got meself a girlfriend.
Vicky and Ricci got kicked out.

00:32.564 --> 00:34.801
You're an arsehole!
I'm gonna leave.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.203
I had to leave and be with him.
(all) Bye!

00:37.270 --> 00:39.572
Charlotte had a boyfriend
and now doesn't.

00:39.639 --> 00:42.575
Me and Scott finished.
Feelings coming back for Gary.

00:42.642 --> 00:45.445
Give us a kiss.
Why has he kissed us?

00:45.512 --> 00:47.714
This could just mean
fucking anything.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.619
What the hell
is going to happen this time?

00:52.685 --> 00:53.987
Geordie Tours.
Where?

00:54.053 --> 00:56.089
Across Europe.
(all cheer)

00:56.790 --> 00:58.958
She's sending us to Europe.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.728
(girls)
What happens on tour stays on tour!

01:02.896 --> 01:04.931
Geordie Tours.
Chaos.

01:04.998 --> 01:09.536
With a little side of pandemonium
and a sprinkling of insane.

01:09.602 --> 01:11.704
Jagerbombs.
Vomit.

01:11.771 --> 01:14.140
Banging. Arguing.
Fuck off!

01:14.207 --> 01:15.542
Blow jobs.
Fucking.

01:15.608 --> 01:17.544
Poo. Bucking.
(girl moans)

01:17.610 --> 01:18.978
Smashing.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.281
Loads more cock in the hole.

01:21.347 --> 01:23.817
This is unbeatable.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.518
Boom! Boom! Boom!

01:25.585 --> 01:28.188
Bring on the fucking carnage!

01:28.254 --> 01:30.990
Geordie Tours!
(all cheer)

01:32.992 --> 01:35.228
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:35.295 --> 01:37.397
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.732
If you look up pulling,
I'm next to it.

01:39.799 --> 01:41.801
I won't kiss a guy
without a six-pack.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.903
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.905
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:45.972 --> 01:47.974
Got the looks, the charm.
Just works.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.443
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.278
The hardest graft I do is my hair.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.914
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:57.550 --> 01:58.885
# WILLY MOON: Yeah Yeah

02:06.826 --> 02:11.030
I'm free, I'm single
and I'm ready for my clit to tingle.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.567
Holl, I'm single now with you.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.336
I know.
Can you believe it?

02:16.402 --> 02:19.439
This time I've got Charlotte back,
wing woman.

02:19.506 --> 02:22.575
So, Charlotte, does that mean
you're on rebound?

02:22.642 --> 02:27.046
No! But yeah, cos you're single now.
That's when you can just run free.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.048
OK, I'm on crazy rebound then.

02:29.115 --> 02:32.452
When me and Gary said our goodbyes,
we ended up kissing.

02:32.519 --> 02:36.956
It smacked us in the face
and I didn't know how to take it.

02:37.023 --> 02:40.627
I'd try to see if I liked it.
That's what people do on the rebound.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.161
It happens all the time.

02:42.228 --> 02:45.498
I have said this before.
I'm not going back to Gary.

02:45.565 --> 02:49.569
I'm not going back to the parsnip.
But this time around, I mean it.

02:58.878 --> 03:02.382
Breather, breather.
Are you buzzing for going in?

03:02.448 --> 03:04.017
Not really.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.053
Last time I seen Charlotte,
it was that awkward kiss.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.056
Last time I've seen Charlotte,
I was kissing her.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.358
A little peck turned
into tongue action.

03:12.425 --> 03:15.128
Are you gonna bang her again?
Nah.

03:15.194 --> 03:19.699
As soon as you do, that's when
she's... That's game over.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.569
I'm one half of the Buck Squad
and Gaz is the other.

03:22.635 --> 03:25.438
Together,
we're like a fucking pulling force.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.477
If they're the Buck Squad, right,
what are we?

03:31.544 --> 03:33.446
What about the Cock Capturers?

03:33.513 --> 03:37.884
So like a fly catcher, isn't it?
A Cock Capturer. A Venus trap.

03:37.951 --> 03:41.588
We're gonna give the Buck Squad
a run for their money.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.257
We're going back in
so we better go get packing.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.326
I've still got so much to pack.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.794
See you in the house!

03:51.064 --> 03:53.900
Last time around,
I got myself a girlfriend.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.868
We're still together.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.036
What's that?

03:57.103 --> 03:59.939
A thousand girls' hearts breaking
in Newcastle.

04:00.006 --> 04:03.843
All Scott and Gaz want to do
all the time is pull.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.778
It's not the boys that worry us.

04:05.845 --> 04:09.782
I think, you know,
it's the actions of Holly

04:09.849 --> 04:12.785
that I just think's
so inappropriate, like.

04:12.852 --> 04:16.055
Once upon a time, me and Holly
were friends with benefits,

04:16.122 --> 04:17.656
but that's all in the past.

04:17.724 --> 04:22.028
Holly's not gonna get the time of
day, especially if it upsets you.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.564
I'm looking forward to getting back

04:24.631 --> 04:26.966
and seeing the rest
of me fucked-up family.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.202
If only I didn't have so many vests.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.749
Surprisingly,
I haven't missed James.

04:42.815 --> 04:46.919
It's completely old news.
It's like a dried-up prune.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.389
So why the fuck did I ever go there?

04:49.455 --> 04:51.658
He knew you were an easy target...

04:51.724 --> 04:55.495
I'm not that easy!
You were there for the taking, Holly.

04:58.364 --> 05:02.769
I can't wait to get in there,
see the girls, have a drink.

05:02.835 --> 05:05.371
We are happy being engaged...
I think.

05:05.438 --> 05:08.041
We're never gonna be
a couple who never argues.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.575
We've got to accept that.

05:09.642 --> 05:13.212
The house is a great environment
for certain things to flourish,

05:13.279 --> 05:14.280
like Chlamydia.

05:14.347 --> 05:16.749
However, it is
one of the worst places

05:16.816 --> 05:19.619
to have a monogamous,
healthy relationship.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.622
Cos obviously being in the house,
it is a test.

05:22.689 --> 05:26.859
Last time in the house, me and Ricci
had a lot of problems and conflict.

05:26.926 --> 05:29.829
It stemmed down to the fact
he's a massive tosser.

05:29.896 --> 05:32.331
Nobody wants to see
me and Vicky arguing.

05:32.398 --> 05:34.067
I think I'm going to rein it in,

05:34.133 --> 05:36.502
so I don't get
any more trouble from Anna.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.706
This is our opportunity
to have some fun and be ourselves

05:39.772 --> 05:42.008
and not get too caught up
in all the drama.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.812
We love each other,
so it shouldn't be that hard.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.614
So, I'm buzzing
cos it's all going off again.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.084
We're back in that house
and I can't wait.

05:51.150 --> 05:54.654
I think you'll be able to hold
your own now you've settled in.

05:54.721 --> 05:58.257
I think I've become a lot more
independent. I've matured a lot.

05:58.324 --> 06:01.694
I don't mind being the little
brother. They are over the hill.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.963
That place is like
an old peoples' home.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.203
Oh, that's gross.
(laughs)

06:10.269 --> 06:12.905
Don't get too drunk.
See you later.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.775
Who's that?

06:15.842 --> 06:18.444
Me and Joel are together,
stronger than ever.

06:18.511 --> 06:20.146
We have been through a lot

06:20.213 --> 06:22.548
and I know nothing is
gonna come between us.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.018
I'm off to pick up Charlotte.

06:26.085 --> 06:28.654
But no doubt
she's going to stink of fake tan

06:28.721 --> 06:30.590
and smell like a tart's arsehole.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.560
Scramble and Egg
are still alive and kicking

06:34.627 --> 06:36.729
and they cannot wait to come back.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.366
(both scream)

06:43.803 --> 06:45.772
He's gonna die!

06:45.838 --> 06:48.007
Oh, my God, that was horrible.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.843
Scramble and Egg, time to go home.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.712
Whoo!

06:59.452 --> 07:01.187
I'm always excited to get back.

07:01.254 --> 07:05.424
To me, it's heaven. It's partying,
it's birds, it's banter.

07:05.491 --> 07:08.127
Last time,
the house was a fucking shit hole.

07:08.194 --> 07:09.762
It absolutely stunk.

07:09.829 --> 07:10.930
Fucking hell!

07:10.997 --> 07:14.500
(laughs)
Look at the fireplace and that!

07:14.567 --> 07:17.336
To see the house change that much,

07:17.403 --> 07:21.707
it's like going from a warehouse
to a mansion. The perfect lads' pad.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.776
I bet as soon as the girls get in,

07:23.843 --> 07:26.579
they'll start shitting
all over the place.

07:26.646 --> 07:29.115
I've missed everyone.
Let's get on it.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.854
We're back in Newcastle.
We're gonna smash it.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.958
This is unbelievable.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.493
(Gaz and Scott) Oi, oi!

07:40.560 --> 07:42.628
The new house is absolutely mint.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.765
James has a bird. I hope
he's not as boring as last time.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.568
I'm gonna go in this comfy room
again, down here.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.370
I'm not gonna share a room
with the Buck Squad.

07:51.437 --> 07:55.174
They should just get a tally chart
to see who can pull the ugliest.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.376
Every time,
when it comes to this time,

07:57.443 --> 08:00.146
and we're about to go in,
I get so excited.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.683
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

08:03.749 --> 08:05.484
All right?
Yeah.

08:05.551 --> 08:10.189
Only thing I'm worried about is
how James is gonna react around me.

08:10.256 --> 08:11.858
I've told me girlfriend Kate

08:11.924 --> 08:14.927
that this time around
I'm not gonna speak to Holly.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.330
This is gonna be awkward. Bothered.

08:17.396 --> 08:21.567
Right, this time,
it's not gonna be the Buck Squad,

08:21.634 --> 08:23.603
it's gonna be the Cock Capturers.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.272
Me and Charlotte
are gonna capture the cock.

08:27.607 --> 08:31.177
Holly challenged the Buck Squad
to a banging competition.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.410
Schoolgirl error.

08:32.477 --> 08:34.080
Game on.
(laughs)

08:35.313 --> 08:37.616
It's time to get back in that house.

08:37.683 --> 08:41.787
This time, I'm not taking any shit.
And I'm not sucking up to anybody.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.258
I'm gan radge, buck birds
and just generally be a legend.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.293
You been on the sunbed?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.329
Last time, Dan was competing
with the Buck Squad.

08:50.396 --> 08:52.198
I hope he just does his own thing.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.800
Welcome back, our kid.

08:56.769 --> 08:59.906
I feel this responsibility for Dan,
as an older brother.

08:59.972 --> 09:03.042
I've got to guide him to girls,
tell him what to do.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.778
So you got the Buck Squad
and the little brother.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.947
I go for quality, not quantity.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.751
(cheering)

09:13.519 --> 09:16.656
I walk into the new house
and it is absolutely beautiful.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.292
Half an hour
before it's covered in piss,

09:19.358 --> 09:21.460
before Holly's sucked someone off.

09:21.527 --> 09:23.329
Vicky and Ricci left last time.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.132
It must be so hard in this house
being a couple.

09:26.198 --> 09:30.403
This is what happened last time...
(indistinctly mumbles)

09:30.469 --> 09:33.439
I don't understand what you said.
(laughter)

09:33.506 --> 09:35.775
It's good to have Ricci
back in the house,

09:35.841 --> 09:38.344
but I still can't understand
a word he says.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.847
I know what I'm saying in me head,
but I can't get the fucker out.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.652
I feel like I've got this hatred
towards Gary now

09:46.719 --> 09:49.922
for all the shit
and all the mind games.

09:49.989 --> 09:52.124
Especially what happened last time.

09:52.191 --> 09:58.130
Last time around, at the end, Gary
picked us up and we ended up kissing.

09:58.197 --> 10:01.367
Well, that was a head fuck
and I was so upset afterwards.

10:01.434 --> 10:06.605
But it was a moment
that was kind of breathtaking

10:06.672 --> 10:10.876
because it's what I always, kind of,
wished or imagined would happen.

10:12.611 --> 10:15.648
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about it.

10:17.316 --> 10:20.419
You'll get married.
You know you're gonna get married.

10:20.486 --> 10:23.622
First commitment I would go to is,
"I will only bang you."

10:23.689 --> 10:26.359
Charlotte might love us.
I love her to bits.

10:26.425 --> 10:30.463
But boyfriend/girlfriend thing...
I can stop it. She sometimes can't.

10:30.529 --> 10:35.801
He constantly says it's me.
It's me who gets the feelings back.

10:35.868 --> 10:39.238
He's the one who leads us on.
He's the one who flirts with me.

10:39.305 --> 10:44.377
Shut up. Stop being a stupid,
fucking ignorant, stupid prick.

10:44.443 --> 10:49.415
Oh, now I'm getting angry.
Angry tears.

10:50.449 --> 10:53.185
He's got Scott now.
He can fucking buck him.

10:53.252 --> 10:55.421
Why is he pretending to be this lad?

10:55.488 --> 10:58.190
I hate being a girl.

11:06.565 --> 11:09.602
You'd be like Scramble and Egg
rolling around the bowl.

11:09.668 --> 11:14.340
Just so happy and so in love
and so unaware of what's going on.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.042
Can that never happen?

11:16.108 --> 11:18.544
In all honesty,
I have missed Charlotte.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.646
The minute we step foot
in that house,

11:20.713 --> 11:23.416
feelings come back
and it's back to square one.

11:26.052 --> 11:29.722
I fucking hate him. He's gonna be
in here. He's gonna be all smarmy.

11:29.789 --> 11:32.324
"Yeah, I'm back now. Bucking Squad."

11:33.559 --> 11:36.495
I'm going into the house 100% single,

11:36.562 --> 11:40.599
and I'm gonna put the biggest
front on ever that I don't like Gary.

11:40.666 --> 11:44.170
What if you got all this
gallivanting out of your system

11:44.236 --> 11:47.840
in the next couple of year...
Yeah, couple of weeks.

11:47.907 --> 11:50.776
Next couple of weeks...
Then chill with Charlotte.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.478
I don't know.

11:52.545 --> 11:56.215
But you love her, though?
(girls yelling)

11:56.282 --> 11:58.784
Come on, Gary.
Is that them?

11:58.851 --> 11:59.852
Yeah!

12:08.194 --> 12:10.029
And it begins.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.966
What the actual fuck?

12:14.033 --> 12:16.202
Have you seen the big fish tank?

12:16.268 --> 12:17.903
Oh, my God!

12:17.970 --> 12:19.772
It's so good.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.574
Oi, oi.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.777
What the hell? This is so weird.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.278
The new house is amazing.

12:26.345 --> 12:29.815
It's the perfect distraction,
so I don't have to speak to Gary.

12:29.882 --> 12:30.883
(girls gasp)

12:30.950 --> 12:34.987
He's doing it. I think that's
the deepest he's ever went.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.556
It is wicked,
everyone being back together.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.558
Things are awkward with Charlotte.

12:39.625 --> 12:44.663
So, I've just been talking to Gary.
Gary was punching above his weight.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.005
I'd be sick.
No, you wouldn't.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.807
I don't want him to plan things.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.176
Clearly, Gary has
some kind of agenda,

12:57.243 --> 12:59.979
and I don't wanna get involved
in his silly games.

13:00.045 --> 13:02.047
Three, two, one...
(all) Go.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.183
God, not this again.

13:05.584 --> 13:11.023
We're all back in the house now.
Let's fucking have it! Yeah!

13:11.090 --> 13:13.425
Set up a new company.
Geordie Tours.

13:13.492 --> 13:14.727
Where?
Across Europe.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.228
(all cheer)

13:16.295 --> 13:17.863
She's sending us to Europe.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.966
(girls)
What happens on tour stays on tour!

13:21.033 --> 13:22.668
Hardcore double sex.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.771
Don't be a fool, wrap your tool.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.808
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:45.925 --> 13:48.527
We're back in Newcastle.
It was mint last time.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.729
I can't wait to do it
all over again.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.365
Everyone's back. It's mint.

13:53.432 --> 13:54.700
(doorbell rings)

13:54.767 --> 13:57.803
Go, Dan. Go, go, go.

13:58.871 --> 14:02.041
So, Anna's our boss. She's the one
who dishes out the jobs

14:02.107 --> 14:04.777
while we're staying
in the Geordie Shore house.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.445
All of them are fucking shit.

14:07.446 --> 14:12.284
I've come up with a new venture cos
you've been shit at everything else.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.986
I was all right at massaging.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.689
I haven't got a clue
what the job's gonna be.

14:16.755 --> 14:19.625
I just hope it's not
gonna be like last time,

14:19.692 --> 14:21.927
where we've got to go
and massage people.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.897
I've seen too many wrinkly
ball sacks and saggy tits.

14:24.964 --> 14:28.500
The only thing that you guys
are good at is partying.

14:28.567 --> 14:32.371
I've set up a new company,
Geordie Tours.

14:32.438 --> 14:35.407
Specialises in hen and stag dos.
Bridesmaids.

14:35.474 --> 14:38.210
And we show them how Geordies party?
That's it.

14:38.277 --> 14:41.647
We've got to show hen and stag
parties how to have a good time.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.682
Could this job get any easier?

14:43.749 --> 14:46.819
When? Where?
Across Europe.

14:46.885 --> 14:49.588
What's Europe?
Europe is a continent.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.890
Europe!
Where in Europe?

14:51.957 --> 14:53.492
All the European cock.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.562
You're going to Amsterdam.
Yes!

14:56.629 --> 14:59.531
(all cheer)
Fucking red light district!

14:59.598 --> 15:01.467
Amsterdam.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.202
And it's Amsterdam!

15:03.269 --> 15:06.739
I've heard their cake selection's
brilliant. (laughter)

15:06.805 --> 15:09.008
You're dealing with stags and hens,

15:09.074 --> 15:13.479
and I do not want to hear that you
have slept with any of the hens.

15:13.545 --> 15:17.182
She didn't say anything about
the hen's mates. Hashtag loophole.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.051
Enjoy getting married.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.388
Amsterdam is a trial. Do you copy me?

15:22.454 --> 15:24.189
To be fair, Anna has delivered.

15:24.256 --> 15:29.028
She's sending us to Europe to look
after hen parties in Amsterdam.

15:29.094 --> 15:33.198
You are representing my company.
I want you to do a good job. OK?

15:33.265 --> 15:36.502
Get me self a little bit of
Dutch fluff, and make her yodel.

15:36.568 --> 15:38.537
(yodels)

15:38.604 --> 15:40.572
Tomorrow, you need to be up early.

15:40.639 --> 15:43.609
You need to get yourselves
to the airport. Goodbye.

15:46.912 --> 15:50.649
What is gonna happen
when Amsterdamish mix with Geordies?

15:50.716 --> 15:53.919
I went to the sex museum in
Amsterdam, and it was weird.

15:53.986 --> 15:57.890
People wanking off goats and stuff.
Bucking Squad on another level.

15:57.956 --> 16:01.093
(makes goat noise)
What happens in Amsterdam...

16:01.160 --> 16:04.229
(girls)
What happens on tour, stay on tour!

16:04.296 --> 16:06.699
...means a whole lot of chaos.

16:06.765 --> 16:09.768
Geordie Tours.
(all cheer)

16:11.070 --> 16:12.404
Europe! Europe!

16:12.471 --> 16:14.907
Amsterdam is not gonna know
what's hit it.

16:14.973 --> 16:18.944
Vicky's fanny's only small.
Mine's gaping wide for all the cock.

16:19.011 --> 16:21.814
Me and Holly have been doing
pelvic floor exercises

16:21.880 --> 16:24.016
to tighten up our walls
of our vaginas.

16:24.083 --> 16:28.454
So, you think you're so wide,
you might make a giant black hole?

16:28.520 --> 16:32.458
I'm doing the pelvic floor exercises.
I'm not doing them.

16:32.524 --> 16:35.761
It's like the Bermuda Triangle.
I've got my legs crossed.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.664
I'm so pleased,
otherwise I'd get sucked right in.

16:38.731 --> 16:42.134
Charlotte's saying
she's ready for loads of cock.

16:42.201 --> 16:43.802
That's not Charlotte,

16:43.869 --> 16:46.839
and I can't help but think
this might all be for Gary.

16:57.549 --> 16:59.017
Are you all ready?

16:59.084 --> 17:04.123
I am fluent in Amsterdamish.
Guten tag, which is hello.

17:04.189 --> 17:08.327
I can't wait to get to Amsterdam,
but I don't know where it is.

17:08.394 --> 17:12.897
Hola. Bonjour. Las Weidersehen.

17:12.964 --> 17:17.002
In my fanny hole. Come, come, come.

17:20.204 --> 17:23.909
(all) We're going to Amsterdam!
We're going to Amsterdam!

17:26.545 --> 17:29.615
Amsterdam!
Sex! Dildos!

17:31.016 --> 17:32.851
(speaks German)

17:32.918 --> 17:34.319
I am a shit house.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.554
(laughter)

17:37.055 --> 17:39.291
I look like a horse.
(laughter)

17:43.762 --> 17:46.999
Amsterdam, we have landed!

17:51.370 --> 17:54.840
Newcastle and Amsterdam,
they're both very similar.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.542
They're easy to get a bang.

17:56.608 --> 18:00.145
The only difference with Amsterdam,
is you've gotta pay for it.

18:00.212 --> 18:03.081
Amsterdam is all about sex,

18:03.148 --> 18:05.484
so Geordie Shore
and Amsterdam together

18:05.551 --> 18:08.854
is all about hardcore double sex.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.057
I'm buzzing to see the hotel.

18:12.124 --> 18:15.694
I'm hoping it's got a sauna,
steam room,the whack.

18:15.761 --> 18:20.098
I can't be seen on that. What?!

18:20.165 --> 18:25.237
We end up on a bastard river,
floating on a fucking boat.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.840
I can't even swim.
I get sea sick.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.945
It's like a house!

18:33.011 --> 18:35.547
So, how the hell am I
supposed to live on a boat?

18:35.614 --> 18:39.985
My name's not Rosie and I don't have
a boyfriend called Jim.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.454
I couldn't care less
if I'm on a canal boat.

18:42.521 --> 18:45.757
I could be on a pedalo.
The same damage will be done.

18:48.994 --> 18:52.097
Everyone's sitting round
being boring as per usual,

18:52.164 --> 18:55.934
so me and Gaz are off out
to smash the red light district.

18:58.470 --> 19:01.740
Do you think the boys are gonna
go to the red light district?

19:01.807 --> 19:05.277
Probably. They'll do anything
for sex. Even pay for it.

19:05.344 --> 19:06.778
That doesn't bother me

19:06.845 --> 19:10.616
cos Gary can shag as many
rank Dutch birds as he wants.

19:21.193 --> 19:23.262
Me and Gaz are
like Dora the Explorer,

19:23.328 --> 19:25.597
walking round
the red light district.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.100
Me and Scott spot
a novelty condom shop.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.536
They've got big ones,
glow in the dark ones,

19:30.602 --> 19:33.505
animal ones, fetish ones.
No wonder they're sex mad.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.706
(laughs)

19:34.773 --> 19:36.041
Do you know your size?

19:36.108 --> 19:41.213
I cannae get round the top.
I'm like, "Whoa!" (laughter)

19:41.280 --> 19:43.949
I hope I can find one
to fit over my fucking pipe.

19:44.016 --> 19:48.387
This is standard. This is bigger.
That's what I need.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.858
I want a condom
that just says "Gaz-ed".

19:52.925 --> 19:55.460
"Gaz-ed"?
Like, "You've been Gaz-ed."

19:55.527 --> 19:58.497
I speak English,
but I don't understand you.

19:58.564 --> 20:00.399
Don't be a fool, wrap your tool.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.267
That's wicked, that shop, like.

20:07.205 --> 20:08.407
Put one on, then.

20:09.241 --> 20:10.442
Get us hard, then.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.578
No, Dan, you're gonna snap it.
Don't.

20:12.644 --> 20:15.681
What do you do with condoms?
You put them on your head.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.452
(laughter)

20:21.853 --> 20:25.090
Fair play to the kid. He's not
gonna get to use it on his cock.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.559
(laughter)

20:31.330 --> 20:34.232
We're getting ready
to hit Amsterdam hard!

20:38.704 --> 20:42.441
It's our first night in Amsterdam.
I can't wait to smash it.

20:42.507 --> 20:43.976
(all cheer)

20:46.678 --> 20:50.349
(all) Tighten it up! Tighten it up!
Tighten it up!

20:50.415 --> 20:53.652
We're in Amsterdam.
All we wanna do is party.

20:58.190 --> 21:02.694
We get to the club, music's bouncing,
everyone's drinking, it's class.

21:03.929 --> 21:07.466
This is what I expected Amsterdam
to be like.

21:07.532 --> 21:10.769
Gaz and Scott go off
to reunite the Buck Squad.

21:11.670 --> 21:15.974
My tongue is already balls deep
down some wicked brunette's throat.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.810
I'm doing what I do best,
sharking birds.

21:18.877 --> 21:22.347
We're looking good
and tonight is about pulling.

21:23.515 --> 21:28.053
I've seen nothing like it.
All the boys have greasy throwbacks.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.521
We'll just do CLS.

21:30.789 --> 21:36.428
CLS. Consequential
lowering of standards.

22:06.758 --> 22:09.594
Gary likes to dish it out,
but he cannot take it.

22:20.672 --> 22:24.009
Thank fuck I haven't
consequentially lowered my standards

22:24.076 --> 22:26.445
with Gary tonight. He can fuck off.

22:29.815 --> 22:31.616
Charlotte is doing my head in,

22:31.683 --> 22:34.720
so I'm gonna go and see
what else Amsterdam has to offer.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.056
I don't give a shit
if Gary wants to pull.

22:38.123 --> 22:41.793
I am so in control of the situation.
He can do what he wants.

22:44.596 --> 22:47.065
So, I'm so drunk
and I just can't pull,

22:47.132 --> 22:50.836
and at this point, what usually
happens is, I just pass out.

22:52.571 --> 22:56.708
I've been keeping me distance from
Holly. I can't be bothered any more.

22:56.775 --> 22:59.478
All I wanna do is have
a good time with the lads.

23:03.014 --> 23:05.183
Holly's mortal again, shock.

23:06.284 --> 23:08.720
The Buck Squad's back
in the fucking game,

23:08.787 --> 23:11.923
but shock, Dan's letting
the single side down.

23:11.990 --> 23:15.327
First night in Amsterdam
and the Buck Squad haven't banged.

23:15.393 --> 23:18.730
I guess the girls they were looking
for didn't come, Ug and Ly.

23:18.797 --> 23:22.267
The Cock Capturers
might have failed tonight,

23:22.334 --> 23:27.139
but I have succeeded in giving Gary
the knockback he deserves.

23:27.205 --> 23:28.874
Get in!

23:33.011 --> 23:36.214
That was actually the best
thing I've ever seen in me life.

23:36.281 --> 23:39.284
Birthdays, another excuse
to get shit-faced.

23:39.351 --> 23:40.619
(all) Down it! Down it!

23:40.685 --> 23:43.889
It smells like Charlotte's vagina.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.424
I am in control.

23:46.491 --> 23:49.294
What the fuck has happened
to Charlotte?

23:49.361 --> 23:51.563
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

24:09.481 --> 24:13.618
We're on a Geordie tour of Amsterdam
and it's fucking mint.

24:13.685 --> 24:16.188
Last night, we absolutely
smashed Amsterdam.

24:16.254 --> 24:19.691
And I'm ready to do it all over
again tonight, like a pure hero.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.928
It's Vicky's birthday today.

24:22.994 --> 24:27.599
I wanna spoil her, and I wanna
see a smile on that girl's face.

24:27.666 --> 24:31.803
Birthdays in the Geordie Shore house,
another excuse to get shit-faced.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.038
(all cheer)

24:34.673 --> 24:39.144
I've got a great feeling. I'm
surrounded by me friends, me fiance.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.246
(cheering)

24:44.249 --> 24:46.985
Guys, I need everyone
in the living room, please.

24:47.052 --> 24:49.888
This blonde bird walks past us.
I'm thinking, "Eh?"

24:49.955 --> 24:51.723
The lads forgotten something?

24:51.790 --> 24:55.527
I'm just here on Anna's behalf,
so I need you all here quickly.

24:55.594 --> 24:58.263
I was starting to think
they'd forgot about work

24:58.330 --> 25:00.365
and could just party and get pissed.

25:01.566 --> 25:04.769
Her name's Sam,
and she's apparently Anna's friend.

25:04.836 --> 25:08.406
I'm gonna be her representative
whilst you're here.

25:08.473 --> 25:10.208
We've got a stag group,

25:10.275 --> 25:14.145
so I need Holly and Charlotte
ready in your uniforms.

25:14.212 --> 25:15.947
You can show the guys a good time.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.250
Stag! Stag! Stag! Stag!

25:18.316 --> 25:20.585
And I cannae think
of two better girls

25:20.652 --> 25:23.521
to show a bunch of cock
how a party is done.

25:34.132 --> 25:36.902
Mine and Holly's job
is that we're on a massive bike

25:36.968 --> 25:39.004
with loads of pedals and a beer pump.

25:39.070 --> 25:42.841
Hi, lads! Come get on the bike,
and get your feet on the pedals.

25:42.908 --> 25:44.876
All the stags sit around it

25:44.943 --> 25:47.479
and have to pedal their fastest
for us to move.

25:47.545 --> 25:52.250
And there's this man steering it.
He sits there and joins in the craic.

25:52.317 --> 25:55.687
You want a good head.
Everyone likes a good bit of head.

25:55.754 --> 25:59.624
Me and Holly are drinking
the beer that we don't even like.

25:59.691 --> 26:02.961
(all chanting) Down it! Down it!
Down it! Down it! Down it!

26:08.400 --> 26:12.704
It's me birthday. I'm gonna see the
sights. See what it has to offer.

26:12.771 --> 26:15.573
Amsterdam's known
for its radge foods,

26:15.640 --> 26:19.444
so I'm gonna take the Squad
and make them try some vile things.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.615
What is it?
Herring.

26:23.682 --> 26:24.816
Heron?
Aye.

26:24.883 --> 26:28.086
So, is herring a fish or a bird?

26:28.153 --> 26:31.289
It's a fish?
I thought it was a bird.

26:31.356 --> 26:36.528
It smells like Charlotte's vagina.
It's fucking lifting.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.500
Wicked.
It's wicked?

26:42.567 --> 26:46.905
So, I think I'm gonna be sick,
but I bypass it cos I'm brick. Nut.

26:46.972 --> 26:50.976
Get me out this place. I wanna
get with the girls and get pissed.

26:51.042 --> 26:53.845
(cheering)

26:53.912 --> 26:57.282
(girls) # Let's get down on the cock
Let's get low on the cock

26:57.349 --> 27:00.885
# Let's get down, let's get low
Let's get down on the cock

27:00.952 --> 27:04.255
# It might be a big cock
It might be a small cock

27:04.322 --> 27:07.292
These lads might not have been
anything to look at,

27:07.359 --> 27:09.027
but they did have good banter.

27:09.094 --> 27:12.063
# It might be a big cock
It might be a small cock

27:12.130 --> 27:13.598
# It might be a round cock

27:13.665 --> 27:17.102
# But any cock's good
When it's cock, cock, cock #

27:17.168 --> 27:19.804
I think Sam would be happy
with what we've done.

27:19.871 --> 27:23.842
We've got them all pissed.
That's what she asked us to do.

27:23.908 --> 27:28.880
(all chanting) Party! Party! Party!

27:32.450 --> 27:34.819
I'm worried
about Charlotte and Gary.

27:34.886 --> 27:38.056
It's none of me business.
I can't help being protective.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.463
So, you're just gonna
keep it casual?

27:45.530 --> 27:47.499
They aren't the Geordie fairy tale.

27:47.565 --> 27:51.069
Rapunzel doesn't hoy down her hair,
Prince climbs up, they kiss,

27:51.136 --> 27:54.773
then he fucks off, has a threesome
and leaves her with an STI

27:54.839 --> 27:57.776
and a fucking broken heart.
That is not what happens.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.578
If I went as far as
sleeping with Charlotte again,

28:00.645 --> 28:02.881
I would just be
sleeping with Charlotte.

28:02.947 --> 28:07.519
You know how she feels. I know.
I know. That's why I wouldn't.

28:07.585 --> 28:10.989
Do I go off with the boys
and bang as many birds as possible,

28:11.056 --> 28:13.691
or chill with Charlotte,
get less grief

28:13.758 --> 28:18.496
and just bang her and have an easy
life? I just don't know what to do.

28:18.563 --> 28:20.498
If Gaz and Charlotte got together,

28:20.565 --> 28:22.801
that would just leave me,
a one-man army.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.670
I'd be like the Jean-Claude
Van Damage of pulling.

28:29.607 --> 28:30.608
Happy birthday.

28:30.675 --> 28:35.246
It's Vicky's birthday. The flowers
are just the start of the surprises.

28:35.313 --> 28:37.282
We're gonna shoot.
Where we going?

28:37.348 --> 28:39.117
You'll find out. See you later.

28:40.118 --> 28:43.021
One of the things that
pisses me off about Amsterdam

28:43.088 --> 28:44.689
is the bell-ends on bikes.

28:44.756 --> 28:49.227
Do you like this bike here?
I thought we'd go for a bike ride.

28:49.294 --> 28:51.529
Imagine my surprise
when Ricci announces

28:51.596 --> 28:54.699
he's gonna take me
on a tandem bike ride.

28:54.766 --> 28:56.401
Oh, my God!

28:56.468 --> 28:57.936
You fucking ball bag.

29:00.905 --> 29:04.642
Looking at bikes is quite funny,
but I know it's gonna be a laugh.

29:04.709 --> 29:07.812
Tweedledum and Tweedledee here.
Tweedletwat.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.648
Look out!
We're not from Amsterdam!

29:10.715 --> 29:13.551
It's so hard.
It's a road, get out. (rings bell)

29:17.522 --> 29:20.458
I've noticed it's getting awkward
with me and James.

29:20.525 --> 29:22.727
I'm completely
getting pied in the face

29:22.794 --> 29:26.264
whenever I try and do anything
and it's frustrating me.

29:26.331 --> 29:29.534
I'm gonna fucking hit him
in the face, or burst into tears.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.837
I do eventually wanna get back
to being friends with Holly,

29:32.904 --> 29:35.940
but for the minute,
I wanna keep that space.

29:36.007 --> 29:38.710
And hopefully,
there'll be nothing else.

29:42.313 --> 29:45.884
It's me birthday night out.
We're all getting ready, excited.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.685
And then the phone goes.

29:47.752 --> 29:50.655
It's Sam, the bearer of bad news,
as per usual.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.690
"I've got a big group tonight,

29:52.757 --> 29:56.227
so I need you and Scott to come
and help me do a guided bar crawl."

29:56.294 --> 29:59.097
Me and Gaz have gotta go
and guide a bar crawl.

29:59.164 --> 30:01.866
It's Vicky's birthday.
Have we got to go?

30:01.933 --> 30:05.170
"You're gonna have to work tonight,
unfortunately."

30:05.236 --> 30:07.972
Gary and Scott are not gonna
be that much of a miss.

30:08.039 --> 30:10.975
I doubt the conversation
will be about bucking.

30:16.447 --> 30:18.183
I hope it's full of young birds.

30:18.249 --> 30:22.287
Amsterdam's famous for tulips.
I'll de-flower the whole country.

30:22.353 --> 30:26.024
You're not here to have a good time,
but to make sure other people do.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.959
No flirting, as well.

30:28.026 --> 30:29.694
Sam says no flirting.

30:29.761 --> 30:33.298
You've got more chance of Hugh
Hefner handing me the mansion keys

30:33.364 --> 30:34.365
than that.

30:34.432 --> 30:38.136
No drinking.
What? Come on!

30:38.203 --> 30:41.539
Is she radge?
I'm definitely getting pissed, me.

30:41.606 --> 30:43.841
I'll have to be a sniper
with the drinks.

30:43.908 --> 30:46.044
Go, go, go, go!

30:46.110 --> 30:48.012
Oh, we've gotta go and work.

30:48.079 --> 30:50.348
Let's get fucking smashed.

30:53.351 --> 30:58.289
Ten blondes, brunettes, all up for
it? That's not work, that's heaven.

30:58.356 --> 31:01.092
This is just an excuse
to get pissed and crack on.

31:08.866 --> 31:11.603
So, the easiest way to pull a girl,
on this planet,

31:11.669 --> 31:12.804
is the ice cube game.

31:13.805 --> 31:16.641
All you need is one ice cube
and about ten girls.

31:17.809 --> 31:23.281
You're necking on with six girls,
and you're playing a "game".

31:23.348 --> 31:26.718
It's also a mint excuse
to watch other girls neck on.

31:26.784 --> 31:28.186
Works in every country.

31:32.957 --> 31:36.995
We're gonna hit Amsterdam hard,
like only a bunch of Geordies can.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.639
Do you think the club's gonna
be as good as last night?

31:47.705 --> 31:48.906
I hope so.

31:48.973 --> 31:52.477
Last night was good,
but there was no boys. No, not one.

31:56.047 --> 31:58.916
I've been that focused
on banging a Dutch bird,

31:58.983 --> 32:01.152
I forgot we're here to work. Oops.

32:02.186 --> 32:05.523
We're gonna go for a Geordie Shore
record, a six-way kiss.

32:08.226 --> 32:11.029
But we can't get all our heads in,

32:11.095 --> 32:13.665
so I'm just gonna neck on
with them one by one.

32:13.731 --> 32:17.602
This job could not get any better.
I think it was made for me and Gaz.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.170
That was not a bad shift.

32:19.237 --> 32:21.973
I'll happily put my name down
for overtime.

32:23.641 --> 32:26.044
It's a shame we've gotta
go meet the others,

32:26.110 --> 32:28.713
or all those birds would be
coming back with me.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.451
We just went off the rails there.

32:33.518 --> 32:36.254
I think we necked on
with about ten birds each.

32:36.321 --> 32:39.023
Sam should be impressed
with the work we done.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.359
I won't be surprised
if she asks us again.

32:44.762 --> 32:47.799
It's Vicky's birthday
and we're gonna go all out.

32:47.865 --> 32:50.968
It's time to celebrate in Amsterdam!

33:01.279 --> 33:03.881
Gary's turned up
and I don't give a shit.

33:03.948 --> 33:06.317
I'm just gonna have a laugh
and crack on.

33:06.384 --> 33:10.254
I walk in and see Charlotte.
I'm gonna sit, have a drink with her

33:10.321 --> 33:12.290
and take a different approach.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.928
Usually, Charlotte is chasing Gary.

33:16.994 --> 33:20.365
But for once,
he's all over her like a fanny rash.

33:22.400 --> 33:26.104
Wingman down. What the fuck?
Is he going soft on us?

33:30.074 --> 33:33.578
For once, I feel like
the ball may be in my court

33:33.644 --> 33:35.613
and I am in control.

33:38.983 --> 33:42.653
I don't have feelings for him like I
used to, so if he wants to pull,

33:42.720 --> 33:44.255
it's not gonna be awkward.

33:47.125 --> 33:50.261
Gary doesn't know how to take it.
I can see in his face.

33:50.328 --> 33:52.997
That's because I am so independent.

33:55.733 --> 33:58.469
If he wants to get wifed in,
he can get wifed in.

33:58.536 --> 34:02.006
Not gonna stop me. I'm on the
dance floor, hoying me wang around.

34:07.145 --> 34:10.681
What has happened to Charlotte?
Is this the same person?

34:14.952 --> 34:18.822
For fuck's sake! Holly keeps
shooting us daggers. What the fuck?

34:18.889 --> 34:22.860
I'm just feeling absolutely shit
about the whole James situation

34:22.927 --> 34:25.096
because he's completely ignoring me.

34:25.163 --> 34:29.199
I just wanna keep that space
between us. I don't want any drama.

34:35.239 --> 34:39.476
James has point-blank ignored Holly.
It is killing her.

34:39.543 --> 34:44.081
I think it must be the harshest
thing I've ever known him do.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.188
The sex museum.
Dust this, buck that.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.956
Sex machine!
The fucking thing'll blow up.

34:53.024 --> 34:56.060
I think James is being
a massive dickhead.

34:56.127 --> 34:59.063
Disco clunge. It looks like
I've got a hanging gammon.

34:59.130 --> 35:03.000
I go and cuddle him.
They've taken it too far this time.

35:03.067 --> 35:05.236
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

35:23.254 --> 35:26.958
Amsterdam is buzzing. We're living
on a boat and having a mint time.

35:27.024 --> 35:31.095
We're having a radge time. I've
always wanted to come to Germany.

35:34.031 --> 35:39.237
She's noticed now that James
is avoiding her at all costs.

35:39.303 --> 35:42.206
Everybody's noticing
an atmosphere with James.

35:42.273 --> 35:46.677
There's tension you could slice.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

35:46.744 --> 35:50.848
I can understand that, though.
You can understand him avoiding her?

35:50.915 --> 35:52.049
He, like...

35:53.050 --> 35:55.887
He doesn't want to hurt
his girlfriend's feelings.

35:55.953 --> 35:59.924
But at the same time, the amount
he's hurting Holly's really bad.

36:06.230 --> 36:09.500
So, all you ever see in Amsterdam
is dust this and buck that,

36:09.567 --> 36:12.803
so what else is there to do,
but go to a fucking sex museum?

36:13.871 --> 36:18.009
The sex museum,
where my ashes will be scattered.

36:18.075 --> 36:21.512
This will be like your house
when you're older, Gaz, won't it?

36:23.447 --> 36:27.084
(Charlotte) Sex machine!
Oh, it tells you about your sex life.

36:27.151 --> 36:28.419
There's a sex machine.

36:28.486 --> 36:31.188
It's supposed
to tell you about your sex life.

36:31.255 --> 36:36.494
"Concentrate more on foreplay."
(laughter)

36:36.561 --> 36:38.262
You just dive in.

36:38.329 --> 36:40.164
That machine's full of shit.

36:40.231 --> 36:43.568
I know for a fact if I do it,
the fucking thing'll blow up.

36:43.634 --> 36:45.169
How much are you, Dan?

36:45.236 --> 36:49.307
(Sophie) It's basically statues what
me mam has on her kitchen table.

36:49.373 --> 36:52.009
Whoop-de-do.
I was hoping to see a bit of porn.

36:52.076 --> 36:55.346
James is being a complete prick.
He's still ignoring me.

36:56.681 --> 37:00.284
I hope the sex museum
isn't giving Holly any ideas

37:00.351 --> 37:04.121
cos the only girl I wanna get
erotic with is me girlfriend, Kate.

37:09.226 --> 37:11.295
Me and the girls
are leaving the lads.

37:11.362 --> 37:14.398
It's time to have girly time
and catch up on the gossip.

37:15.933 --> 37:18.502
I'm talking to the girls about James

37:18.569 --> 37:22.506
because I feel like
I've lost me best friend.

37:32.049 --> 37:36.053
He's making everyone uncomfortable.
It's not nice.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.456
I think James is being
a massive dickhead.

37:38.522 --> 37:42.693
Just leave all this emotion behind
in Amsterdam. Leave it on the boat.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.363
It'll get washed away
when the Titanic sinks.

37:48.265 --> 37:51.569
It's our last night,
and we're gonna tear it a new one.

37:51.636 --> 37:55.206
But James has got a face
like a smacked arse.

37:55.272 --> 37:57.808
James, you coming out?
Nah, not tonight.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.410
You're not gonna get ready?

37:59.477 --> 38:02.413
Nah, I'm gonna have a chilled
one tonight and stop in.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.814
James is full of shit.

38:03.881 --> 38:07.485
The only reason he's not coming out
is so he can avoid Holly again.

38:07.551 --> 38:10.855
# Let's get down, let's get low
Let's get down on the cock

38:13.124 --> 38:14.458
# It might be a round cock

38:14.525 --> 38:16.761
# But any cock's good
When it's cock, cock #

38:18.562 --> 38:21.732
It's our last night in Amsterdam,
so we're going out.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.367
What is that? It's paper.

38:23.434 --> 38:27.238
I thought it was knickers.
I didn't know it was paper.

38:27.304 --> 38:30.975
But I cant wear any knickers
cos I've got VPL.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.644
She's made knickers.
Out of what?

38:33.711 --> 38:35.279
Wrapping paper.

38:35.346 --> 38:40.618
Paper knickers is the best idea
I have ever had. I am a genius.

38:40.685 --> 38:42.620
Last night out in Amsterdam.

38:42.687 --> 38:45.956
It's time to head out
and do serious damage.

38:55.166 --> 38:59.103
It's completely pathetic that James
hasn't come out on our last night,

38:59.170 --> 39:03.174
but it does mean I can just go out,
have a good time and just be myself.

39:06.310 --> 39:08.379
James isn't coming out. Who cares?

39:08.446 --> 39:11.015
The only thing he does
is make us look good.

39:13.751 --> 39:16.487
James isn't just pie-ing Holly
by not coming out,

39:16.554 --> 39:17.922
he's pie-ing everyone.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.232
We are gonna commandeer
all the Dutch cock.

39:31.836 --> 39:35.806
I can't believe I am slut dropping
a man who is three times my age.

40:03.734 --> 40:07.538
You know what happens
when paper gets wet.

40:07.605 --> 40:10.875
My pants have come apart.
It looks like a hanging gammon.

40:15.913 --> 40:19.583
Once again, Charlotte is commando
with her flaps out.

40:24.722 --> 40:28.259
Luckily, Holly brought
a spare pair of knickers out.

40:28.325 --> 40:32.530
She's got thrush. In case she'd
wanted to pull, she'd have to change.

40:32.596 --> 40:36.367
They're on! They're on!
Yay!

40:39.203 --> 40:41.272
We've had a fucking boss last night.

40:43.641 --> 40:47.211
And then this radge Dutch kid
starts going acker,

40:47.278 --> 40:49.480
piping off his saxophone on stage.

40:49.547 --> 40:52.883
I thought Amsterdam was
supposed to be about live sex shows,

40:52.950 --> 40:54.351
not live sax shows.

40:59.089 --> 41:01.525
It's time to get back
to the pirate ship.

41:09.934 --> 41:12.403
It's been a great
last night in Amsterdam.

41:12.469 --> 41:14.371
Newcastle!
To the Toon.

41:14.438 --> 41:16.373
Down it! Down it!

41:16.440 --> 41:20.744
I think, "Let's have loads of drinks
to celebrate." And I'm mortal.

41:23.314 --> 41:27.718
And Gary really, really wants us
to come and cuddle for five minutes.

41:27.785 --> 41:29.420
He can't stop asking us.

41:29.486 --> 41:32.489
And I'm kinda thinking,
the roles have reversed here.

41:32.556 --> 41:34.758
You want me and I don't want you.

41:37.027 --> 41:39.196
Me and Holly take ourselves
off to bed.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.202
(Gary) Hell.

41:46.270 --> 41:49.874
Gary's come in the room where me
and Holly are lying together.

41:52.676 --> 41:53.677
Can I get in?

42:00.784 --> 42:04.054
So, I go and cuddle him
and there's nothing wrong with that.

42:05.189 --> 42:06.690
I've been independent.

42:06.757 --> 42:10.060
I've got what I wanted with Gary.
I've put him in his place.

42:10.127 --> 42:12.963
I've told him I don't have
feelings for him any more,

42:13.030 --> 42:14.999
we won't be having sex.
(moaning)

42:15.065 --> 42:18.269
And then all of a sudden,
I wanna shag him. (moans)

42:18.335 --> 42:22.573
Charlotte's bouncing on top of us,
screaming in fucking Holly's ear.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.509
All of a sudden,
I start hearing these noises.

42:26.644 --> 42:30.147
And I'm wondering, "Am I awake now?"

42:30.214 --> 42:35.252
"Oh! Yeah!"
In this crazy American accent.

42:35.319 --> 42:38.622
I'm thinking, "Why the fuck
is she moaning in American?"

42:38.689 --> 42:42.293
And secondly, "Why the fuck are they
having sex right next to me?"

42:42.359 --> 42:44.295
They've taken it too far this time.

42:46.163 --> 42:49.533
What the fuck is going on with
me and Gary? This is so weird.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.602
Will it change when we're home?

42:56.473 --> 42:58.909
Fuck me,
I'm in bed with the parsnip.

43:00.544 --> 43:02.880
It's time to kick off in Newcastle.

43:02.947 --> 43:05.249
Wait until the Buck Squad
see this one.

43:05.316 --> 43:07.985
(laughs)
James is looking down his nose.

43:08.052 --> 43:11.422
It's Geordie Shore,
not Geordie fucking bore.

43:11.488 --> 43:14.224
Everyone knows drunken sex
is the best sex.
