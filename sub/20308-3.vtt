WEBVTT

00:02.585 --> 00:05.547
(siren wailing)

00:11.553 --> 00:14.097
-Captain.
-Howard, I'm sorry.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.432
They're recommending demotion.

00:16.182 --> 00:19.728
-(sighs) That was a clean shoot, Frank.
-I know that.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.104
I walked into a store
that was being robbed.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.981
The perpetrator turned his weapon on me.

00:23.815 --> 00:27.027
Judas, what in heaven's name
was I supposed to do?

00:27.485 --> 00:30.947
Your load wasn't department authorized,
the weapon wasn't department issued,

00:31.031 --> 00:33.033
he was 14 with no priors,

00:33.825 --> 00:35.618
the entry wound was in his side.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.620
(sighs)

00:38.580 --> 00:39.873
Sergeant Hunter.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.667
Howard, can I try out an idea on you?

00:43.251 --> 00:44.627
(chattering)

00:44.711 --> 00:47.589
Gentlemen and ladies,

00:48.590 --> 00:49.591
good morning.

00:51.259 --> 00:54.888
I announce reshuffling in our ranks.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.516
Stanislav Jablonski,

00:59.517 --> 01:04.439
roll call sergeant,
is now on the voluntary retirement list

01:04.522 --> 01:06.107
for reasons of health.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.779
And I henceforth am Sergeant Hunter.

01:10.862 --> 01:14.365
Oh, Lord, you got to
fight this, Lieutenant.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.617
(chattering)

01:15.700 --> 01:18.161
Grateful as I am for the sentiment

01:18.828 --> 01:22.624
expressed in Andrew's exhortation,
I won't allow myself to be ensnared

01:22.707 --> 01:26.169
in the web of bureaucratic reviews
or board of appeals.

01:26.252 --> 01:30.757
As I have done for the last 14 years,
I'm going to go about the business

01:30.840 --> 01:33.176
of being a law enforcement officer

01:33.259 --> 01:35.804
as it is given me to perform the task.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.264
Item one...

01:38.348 --> 01:42.018
Because if we're asking officers
to use discretion in the street,

01:42.102 --> 01:44.187
I want veterans making the calls.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.774
Look, if you have any pull
with Councilman Wisniewski

01:47.857 --> 01:51.069
I suggest you use it
'cause this is gonna get bad fast.

01:51.986 --> 01:52.821
Right.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.949
-Hi.
-Hi. Strike settled?

01:56.491 --> 01:59.702
Dropping off case files for the lawyers
who replace us.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.038
Sidney Leftcourt called me this morning.

02:02.288 --> 02:06.668
Said the Bar Association contacted him,
asked if he wanted to do some PD work.

02:06.751 --> 02:09.963
-He's a negligence attorney.
-Sidney Leftcourt Sr.

02:10.046 --> 02:11.297
(knocking)

02:12.006 --> 02:14.843
We're meeting with the city council
negotiators at 8:00.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.012
Any progress
on those senior citizens assaults?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.640
Have I told you I'd favor settlement?

02:21.432 --> 02:23.101
They've got to give the jobs back.

02:24.602 --> 02:28.731
Items related
to the current despicable job action

02:28.815 --> 02:31.151
carried on by the city's public defenders.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.777
(grumbling)

02:32.861 --> 02:35.113
The usual motor patrol pairings

02:35.196 --> 02:38.992
will instead take foot patrol
in their assigned sectors.

02:39.075 --> 02:42.036
Foot? Oh, my aching bunions.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.373
Listen up. Listen up.
Until the strike is resolved,

02:45.456 --> 02:50.378
motor patrol units will be manned
by transferees from Division.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.505
To you newcomers, welcome.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.717
Your assignments are posted
on the board upstairs.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.303
That's just to the left of the landing.

02:58.386 --> 03:01.306
Keep saying it, Neal.
Keep telling me it isn't fate.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.392
-It isn't fate.
-It's fate.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.895
It's Division, babe. (chuckles)

03:07.896 --> 03:11.733
To all officers,
Division's issued this directive.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.570
"Because of the ongoing
public defender's strike,

03:15.653 --> 03:18.698
at 6:00 this morning, detainees arrested

03:18.781 --> 03:22.327
in the past 48 hours
for relatively minor offenses

03:22.410 --> 03:26.664
and not yet charged or arraigned
have been released."

03:26.748 --> 03:29.167
-(coughs)
-Listen up, there's more.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.836
-(chattering)
-"Consonant with this policy

03:31.920 --> 03:34.756
because of the difficulty
of securing representation

03:34.839 --> 03:36.633
for the indigent offenders,

03:37.175 --> 03:40.970
until settlement of the strike,
officers will exercise prudence

03:41.054 --> 03:43.139
in making discretionary arrests."

03:43.223 --> 03:45.600
(clamoring)

03:45.683 --> 03:48.311
A pop is either right or it's wrong.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.687
(agreeing)

03:49.771 --> 03:52.357
I couldn't agree with you more.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.527
And yet it remains for us to do our jobs

03:56.611 --> 04:00.406
with whatever difficulty
or however unfairly burdened

04:00.490 --> 04:02.242
or charged or unacknowledged

04:02.325 --> 04:05.870
or even held in disrepute
by those we serve.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.915
We sought our duty freely.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.919
Let us perform it
to the best of our abilities.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.880
And with pride.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.010
I'm looking forward to serving with you.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.306
-Dismissed.
-Got to walk all day.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.891
All day I got to walk.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.061
Hey, hey, hey. Slow down, lover.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.355
She didn't exactly dig your act yesterday.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.149
You got to learn to hear below the words.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.444
Uh, what do you say...

04:40.071 --> 04:43.616
We submit this to the Second Chance
For Happiness Book Club?

04:44.784 --> 04:46.035
Break your arm.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.497
-She's weakening.
-(chuckles)

04:49.747 --> 04:52.583
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:52.667 --> 04:54.377
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:54.460 --> 04:58.256
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th street.</i>

04:58.339 --> 04:59.924
(sirens wailing)

05:05.638 --> 05:08.683
(theme music playing)

07:06.551 --> 07:10.179
Sergeant, how about I work the squad room
with you this morning?

07:10.263 --> 07:12.849
Oh, I am grateful for the thought,
Sergeant Bates,

07:12.932 --> 07:16.144
but I believe that you're best assigned

07:16.227 --> 07:20.356
supervising the Division
transferees in motor patrol.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.274
You're right.

07:25.903 --> 07:29.157
-Russo. Who's Russo?
-Here.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.576
Tina.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.787
Patrick Flaherty. Unit six.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.582
And six is my lucky number.

07:37.665 --> 07:41.335
Well, it better be because that car
is a real bomb.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.879
Patrick Flaherty, Sergeant.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.505
-How you doing?
-Tina Russo.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.341
Tina, how are you? What do you say
to some company today?

07:47.425 --> 07:49.343
Patrick Flaherty from the Heights?

07:49.427 --> 07:51.262
Used to ride with Andy Schuler?

07:52.221 --> 07:53.097
That's right.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.268
Remember it.
I don't want you talking to me, kid.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.438
You got it.

08:03.399 --> 08:04.275
Let's go.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.737
Yo, Howard.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.948
I heard you're the man this morning.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.202
You look good in blue. I mean that.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.913
Jesus, we are in the middle
of a crisis situation.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.165
The cavalry has arrived, Howie.

08:19.624 --> 08:23.878
Cut a deal with the city to supply lawyers
for your indigents in custody.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.129
Meet my boy.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.967
Heaven help the indigents.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.802
I wouldn't count on it, Howie.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.847
It hasn't happened yet.
Interrogation is that way.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.141
Jesus, where's the bathroom?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.435
It's on the way, Sy, it's on the way.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.855
Can you make it? We're almost there, huh.

08:43.439 --> 08:47.401
You know, Sy's plumbing
is not working too well.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.320
He's got one of those bags.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.364
But his noodle is class A.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.866
(speaks Spanish)

08:53.950 --> 08:56.410
You ever think of using perfume, Sy?

08:56.494 --> 08:57.870
For reasons we'll get to,

08:57.954 --> 09:00.122
I wanted to give you your
assignments this morning.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.832
Henry, you--

09:04.418 --> 09:06.921
You're seeing Chief Daniels
on a black tar task force.

09:07.004 --> 09:10.424
Trying to get a budget allocation
over two figures.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.593
Norman, when the open
the cells this morning

09:12.677 --> 09:14.595
because of the PD's job action,

09:14.887 --> 09:17.306
three class A felons got released
among the non-A perps.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.143
-I'll pick them up. Yeah.
-Uniform backup as appropriate.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.813
For all of you,
SID turned up evidence overnight

09:23.896 --> 09:26.482
linking the Levison murder
with the earlier rob-assaults

09:26.566 --> 09:28.276
of the elderly over on Michigan Avenue.

09:28.359 --> 09:32.029
Neal, J.D., interview possible witnesses
in the stationhouse.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.532
Maybe they can help each
other with recollections.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.867
Mick, authorization finally came through.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.370
You can start your undercover
at the Puleo Bakery.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.621
Counterman's your contact.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.124
Howard Hunter's been demoted to sergeant.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.711
Department's got nothing
but guts, huh, Captain?

09:47.545 --> 09:49.213
I've appointed Howard
sergeant of the watch.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.299
After today he'll be giving
you your assignments.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.135
It's gonna be a tough adjustment
for him across the board.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.846
Maybe the toughest part's gonna be
working with officers

09:56.929 --> 10:00.224
who used to be his equals in rank
who are now his superiors.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.934
We won't rub his nose in it, Captain.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.979
Well, I know each of you
will do everything you can

10:05.062 --> 10:06.564
to help him make this transition.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.358
Good shift.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.445
If I was Hunter
I'd tell them all to kiss my...

10:17.533 --> 10:19.410
Stan Jablonski is on two, Captain.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.828
Thanks, Howard.

10:22.663 --> 10:23.873
FRANK: Stan, how are you?

10:23.956 --> 10:26.500
They got me all drugged up, Captain.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.169
Can't feel a thing.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.212
Can you beat it?

10:30.796 --> 10:34.550
Came in for tests,
and they're putting me under the knife.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.552
Oh, I'm sure it'll turn out all right.

10:37.136 --> 10:40.264
So how's it going?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.266
FRANK (over phone): <i>Um, okay.</i>

10:43.476 --> 10:45.102
Is there anything I can do for you, Stan?

10:45.186 --> 10:48.272
STAN (over phone): <i>Yeah, have somebody</i>
<i>sneak me in a kielbasa.</i>

10:48.356 --> 10:50.107
<i>The food here is the worst.</i>

10:50.483 --> 10:53.986
(groans) Got to go now.
Looks like it's time.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.531
-So long, Stan. Good luck.
<i>-So long, Captain.</i>

11:00.242 --> 11:01.077
Mick?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.704
Why aren't I on
the old people's investigation?

11:03.788 --> 11:06.165
-It's shoe leather.
-I want it.

11:06.248 --> 11:10.086
Mick, it took us a month to get permission
from that bakery owner for your stakeout.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.755
I'm not being punished for yelling
at your wife, am I?

11:12.838 --> 11:15.132
-That's out of line.
-But am I right?

11:15.216 --> 11:18.427
I think you were overinvolved.
I don't want you making mistakes.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.887
While LaRue and Washington are bringing in

11:19.970 --> 11:21.931
possible witnesses
from last night's homicides,

11:22.014 --> 11:26.435
I'd suggest we run down MOs
on fences for stolen checks.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.730
I'd start with stores
closest to the post office.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.193
Keep Neal and J.D. posted.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.361
Thank you.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.492
COUNCILMAN: When I proposed
a 30 percent cutback in PD staff,

11:41.575 --> 11:43.452
I was out to make a point.

11:43.869 --> 11:47.498
Less money for mollycoddling criminals
and more money for jails.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.376
We didn't come down here to listen to you
make a speech, Wisniewski.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.670
And I didn't come here to make one either.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.880
It's our understanding
that the city council

11:54.964 --> 11:56.382
held a midnight caucus.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.885
That's true.
We had a long, difficult evening.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.138
Aw, you're breaking our hearts here.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.432
You are out of line, young man.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.475
Would you allow the councilman to speak?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.562
That's all he ever does,
but he never says anything.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.772
-That's enough, Danny.
-All right, look.

12:12.940 --> 12:15.234
Nobody is trying to be unreasonable here.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.903
We understand that you people
have legitimate job concerns

12:17.987 --> 12:20.114
and if our first proposal was too harsh,

12:20.197 --> 12:22.408
there's no reason
that has to be written in stone.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.618
DANNY: Ah, translation from English.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.954
Iggy's plan has backfired.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.914
Public opinion is with the PDs.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.292
Shorts getting a little tight, Iggy?

12:31.834 --> 12:35.588
There's no dealing with these people.
They've got a hooligan in charge!

12:36.297 --> 12:38.090
Goodbye, civilization!

12:38.549 --> 12:39.675
That was helpful.

12:43.929 --> 12:48.893
Yo, Jerry. Jerry! Put that away.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.316
All done, honey.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.279
Guy's been all done for 20 years.

13:00.362 --> 13:04.200
Hey, Sarge, I heard the captain's wife
is leading the PD strike. Is that right?

13:04.283 --> 13:06.285
She's head of some committee or something.
I don't know.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.871
-You met the captain yet, you guys?
-Not really.

13:09.747 --> 13:10.706
You're gonna like him.

13:11.707 --> 13:12.583
So, Tina,

13:13.209 --> 13:16.712
I hear that you already
know Detective LaRue.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.630
We met.

13:18.839 --> 13:22.051
Patrick, you and Detective Buntz
go back to the Heights together?

13:22.134 --> 13:24.178
I don't know Detective Buntz.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.557
Let's get clear on this discretion
making arrests.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.227
Now we see an A-type felony,

13:31.811 --> 13:34.021
that's it, no questions,
we take the perp in.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.190
Anything else, I mean anything else,

13:36.273 --> 13:39.109
we bang the pots and pans together,
we make a lot of noise

13:39.193 --> 13:41.403
then we find some reason
not to make the collar.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.989
How long do you
think we can keep that up, Sarge?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.366
As long as the PD strike lasts.

13:45.449 --> 13:49.286
Yeah, but how long can we keep it up
before the perps figure the play?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.705
Knowing we ain't making any arrests,

13:51.789 --> 13:53.707
they start thieving
whatever isn't tied down.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.960
Well, I guess we're gonna
have to find that out.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.461
-Russo.
-Hmm?

13:57.545 --> 13:58.838
Spot quiz.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.715
If it's murder, what do we do?

14:01.799 --> 14:04.635
Uh, close call,
but I think we take them in.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.220
-Arson?
-A pop.

14:06.303 --> 14:09.932
What about kicking? That would depend
where the kick was aimed.

14:10.724 --> 14:14.228
Was it a drunk
just doing a lazy kick at a pal?

14:14.770 --> 14:17.064
Which in case,
I would personally use discretion.

14:17.147 --> 14:21.819
Or, on the other hand,
what if it was in the genital area?

14:22.319 --> 14:23.529
Oh!

14:23.612 --> 14:25.614
Has he been like this a long time?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.533
I just met the officer.

14:27.992 --> 14:31.412
Furthermore, it is not our job
to be pounding the pavement

14:31.495 --> 14:33.414
at this advanced stage of our seniority.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.498
Renko, that's a part of it.

14:34.582 --> 14:38.294
And if I happen to see a PD,
I'm gonna do bodily harm regardless--

14:38.377 --> 14:41.589
-Police. Hey, come here.
-Oh, Lord, what is this?

14:41.672 --> 14:43.257
This guy, he's got my bananas.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.551
Sticking them in his ear.
He's a nut. Come on.

14:45.634 --> 14:48.512
If you can't get through,
get me somebody who can.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.056
Or at least-- at least get me
a transmitter that works.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.017
Hey, mister, why are you doing this?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.019
I'll turn it around on you.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.730
What would you do
if you had been held prisoner

14:57.813 --> 15:00.649
on a gravity shelf for almost 18 months?

15:00.733 --> 15:03.193
Tortured night and day by the laser squad.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.155
The man's got a point.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.533
Sir, we had no idea
you'd been held there that long.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.161
I don't believe this. Bust him!

15:12.244 --> 15:15.539
I'm sorry, sir, but due to circumstances
we did not create,

15:15.623 --> 15:16.832
we can't do it right now.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.792
I understand what you mean.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.670
I was lost out there fuseless
in that barren waste.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.923
My shield smashed into fragments.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.300
Where is this gravity shelf, sir?

15:26.383 --> 15:29.261
Oh... Forget about it. Forget about it.
Don't ever go there.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.346
You wouldn't last a minute.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.806
Sir, excuse me.
How much would two bucks buy?

15:32.890 --> 15:34.391
-Three bunches.
-Three bunches?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.185
Sire, I have a suggestion.

15:36.268 --> 15:40.356
Why don't we take a walk around the corner
and we can continue this battle?

15:40.564 --> 15:42.608
They're tastier if you put them
in your mouth.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.693
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

15:48.948 --> 15:49.782
No.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.620
(shop bell rings)

16:02.795 --> 16:03.837
Thanks very much.

16:06.882 --> 16:07.758
What can I get you?

16:08.175 --> 16:10.636
Uh, I want to cash a check.

16:12.429 --> 16:15.516
Guy I knew up in Harrisonville
said maybe you could help me out.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.477
Florence Sinowitz.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.982
-Is that you, Florence Sinowitz?
-Do you want to do business or not?

16:26.276 --> 16:27.611
House gets 60 percent.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.197
(chuckles) Get out of here.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.116
Hey, that's the going rate
for this kind of paper.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.575
I got risks, too, you know.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.536
Take it or leave it.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.248
Okay.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.384
(sighs)

16:50.467 --> 16:56.056
Twenty, 40, 60, 80,
120, 135, 136. That's it.

16:56.140 --> 16:59.768
Not quite, toe jam. You're under arrest.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.687
MAN 1: Hey, man,
what is the matter with you?

17:01.770 --> 17:03.814
-Can't you see where you're going?
-(siren blares)

17:03.897 --> 17:06.108
How come you stopped your car
in the middle of the street?

17:06.191 --> 17:09.069
-MAN 2: Are you blind?
-MAN 1: Hell, no, I'm not blind.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.905
-If your brake lights worked--
-MAN 2: My brake lights are working--

17:11.989 --> 17:13.991
Yo, yo, hang on, buddy.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.119
(shouting)

17:17.202 --> 17:19.538
All right, that's it.
We're gonna settle this right here.

17:19.621 --> 17:20.456
Now what happened?

17:20.539 --> 17:21.832
-I'll--
-I'll tell you what happened!

17:21.915 --> 17:25.169
I stopped and this turkey rammed me
in my backside! That's what happened!

17:25.252 --> 17:27.129
Well, if you had given me--

17:27.212 --> 17:29.339
Don't you go lying to me!

17:29.423 --> 17:30.841
That's enough. Go!

17:30.924 --> 17:34.762
That's it. I want license, registration,
and insurance cards from both of you now.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.513
-MAN: Insurance?
-LUCY: Yes.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.683
With an automobile like this
you don't need insurance.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.477
-Nothing happens to her.
-MAN: Oh, that's perfect, man.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.145
That's perfect!
You don't have no insurance?

17:43.228 --> 17:46.023
-MAN: Right!
-He don't have no insurance. Arrest him!

17:46.106 --> 17:47.983
He don't have no insurance.
You're going to jail.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.277
No one is going to jail today.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.321
That's not gonna happen.
I want you to exchange names

17:52.404 --> 17:54.073
and numbers and that's it.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.200
And they call this justice?

17:56.283 --> 17:57.743
-That's right.
-No, I'll show you justice.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.244
I'll show you justice.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.917
-(tires squeal)
-Hey, where you going?

18:07.628 --> 18:08.754
I got his number.

18:09.838 --> 18:10.798
I got it.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.424
I can't figure it out.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.552
The guy with insurance takes off.
Unbelievable.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.721
I tell you,
about 60 percent of everything up here--

18:17.805 --> 18:20.516
Well, then I believe
I should be on my way.

18:21.016 --> 18:22.017
Hold it.

18:22.559 --> 18:26.271
I want that Caddy to have insurance
or I want it up on blocks, you got that?

18:27.231 --> 18:29.358
Yes, Sergeant, ma'am.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.277
-(tires squeal)
-(woman shrieks)

18:35.405 --> 18:36.490
What the hell?

18:36.573 --> 18:38.075
Couldn't see your brake light.

18:38.158 --> 18:41.703
Well, check it out!
What you gonna do about that?!

18:41.787 --> 18:43.288
PATRICK: Is it discretion, Sergeant?

18:43.622 --> 18:45.415
Tina. No.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.168
You're under arrest.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.672
Pushed it just too far, didn't you, huh?

18:52.881 --> 18:54.299
What kind of pressing business was it?

18:54.383 --> 18:56.301
A sudden opening
to have his teeth cleaned?

18:57.511 --> 18:59.304
Did he say when he wanted to reschedule?

19:00.931 --> 19:02.808
Look, tell Chief Daniels I'm a big boy.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.978
He doesn't want to allocate funds
for black tar, that's his prerogative,

19:06.061 --> 19:07.771
but what I don't want
is to be jerked around

19:07.855 --> 19:09.565
until he decides to tell me that.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.193
Great. We'll reschedule.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.154
I'll be looking forward to your call.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.365
Yo, I could use some
more bodies over here.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.617
Take Thorstein from the Heights
and send me Lane

19:20.701 --> 19:23.662
and Fitzsimmons from the Polk, ASAP.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.497
This is classic!

19:26.081 --> 19:27.833
Provoke a man beyond toleration,

19:27.916 --> 19:30.043
and then persecute him for protecting
his own interests.

19:30.127 --> 19:33.463
-Vehicular assault.
-217, roger. Hang on.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.967
-How you doing, Howard?
-Holding down the fort, Captain.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.970
-Your name, sir?
-Eli Arnold, victim.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.597
HOWARD: Eli Arnold Victim.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.725
-First felon, Captain.
-Attaboy, Norm.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.021
I checked with County, Captain.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.398
Sergeant Jablonski
is still in the operating room.

19:51.481 --> 19:54.985
-Thank you.
-Tuesday. Tuesday.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.154
You just said Monday, Mr. Gidwitz.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.614
Was it Monday?

19:58.697 --> 20:01.992
Monday or Tuesday, Irma? It was the day...

20:02.075 --> 20:04.453
We got a big shot of catching the guy.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.623
-Progress?
-Getting nowhere fast, Captain.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.499
Most of these folks,
they didn't see anything.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.919
Those that did,
they can't remember what it was.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.171
Let's try them in a group.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.923
-Hey, Lieutenant.
-Yeah, Norm?

20:16.006 --> 20:17.966
-You busy?
-Can't you tell?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.509
You know Carlos Gomez, right?

20:20.344 --> 20:22.012
Muscle man in Echevarria's outfit.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.764
We put him away two days
ago on murder one.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.516
Yeah, well, he's one of the guys
they let out last night.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.061
-You're kidding.
-You know where he hangs?

20:29.937 --> 20:30.938
Let's go.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.274
MICK: So, you got two priors pending.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.944
Both for receiving
and selling stolen property.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.571
Plus, we found checks from the guy's

20:39.655 --> 20:42.241
other assault victims
in your cash register.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.702
How does accessory to murder sound to you?

20:45.786 --> 20:48.121
-Hey, come on.
-Relax, bro.

20:48.205 --> 20:51.792
Detective Belker's been watching
too many reruns of <i>Deputy Dawg.</i>

20:51.875 --> 20:53.877
They ain't got a case, right, Sy?

20:53.961 --> 20:56.296
Well, I'll have to bone up
on the specific case law.

20:56.380 --> 21:00.259
What, everything anybody says
he's got to bone up on it.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.302
-(Sy groans)
-What's the matter?

21:02.386 --> 21:04.888
-It the back, Sy?
-No, it's okay. I'm all right.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.516
I'm fine, I'm fine. What was the question?

21:07.599 --> 21:10.519
Is he hanging tough or what?
The man's a boar.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.854
Look, I was in the middle of chapter 11.

21:12.938 --> 21:16.316
My other PD was putting together a package
on my other two priors,

21:16.400 --> 21:20.320
plus, I got this federal rap
for dealing with government checks.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.492
If I roll on this,
she's who puts it together.

21:25.575 --> 21:26.576
What's her name?

21:27.536 --> 21:29.162
-Davenport.
-She's on strike.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.706
He can do this for you.

21:30.789 --> 21:35.711
NG. I got a name for you,
but she's got to do the deal.

21:36.586 --> 21:37.879
You listen to me.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.800
That name you got belongs
to a guy who's killing people.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.927
And if you don't give us that name
before he kills somebody else,

21:44.011 --> 21:47.848
it's gonna be 20 years before you
ever fence another check.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.727
So get me my lawyer.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.228
You got a lawyer!

21:53.895 --> 21:56.273
JESUS: Pretty close to intimidating
your clients, huh?

21:56.356 --> 21:59.234
Don't worry. I ain't intimidated.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.610
(grunts)

22:02.404 --> 22:05.615
Some people take any latitude
you give them for weakness.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.826
Well, those people
you don't give any latitude to.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.786
Can we resume, folks?

22:09.870 --> 22:12.622
-Uh, Councilman.
-What?

22:13.874 --> 22:15.751
Before the shouting started this morning,

22:15.834 --> 22:18.128
I had the feeling
that there was negotiating room

22:18.211 --> 22:19.338
in the council's position.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.049
Let me tell you something, miss.

22:22.132 --> 22:25.635
Nobody is gonna go out on a limb
as long as your friend Mr. Santana

22:25.719 --> 22:28.472
is sitting out there
with his trusty little saw.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.849
But you were going to
offer a new proposal.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.268
-Look, no one likes--
-What terms?

22:34.269 --> 22:37.105
Well, first of all, you might have
been able to get your jobs back.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.899
And without being punished for going out.

22:38.982 --> 22:42.027
But not, see,
if it's just gonna be a foot in the door

22:42.110 --> 22:45.197
so that he can ask for 50 things more
and just to embarrass me.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.615
Rough negotiating session out here?

22:46.698 --> 22:47.783
What's going on, Joyce?

22:48.658 --> 22:50.702
The councilman's proposed
restoring the jobs

22:50.786 --> 22:52.120
and no reprisals for the strike.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.748
It is just a possibility.
We are discussing it.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.416
Well, I think we can do better.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.711
I think we should take it back
to the membership, Danny.

23:03.590 --> 23:06.843
Joyce, why do you think
they're backing down?

23:06.927 --> 23:09.137
I think we should take it back.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.891
Uh, offer's official?

23:13.683 --> 23:15.268
You won't lie and deny you made it?

23:15.352 --> 23:20.107
-You know, you are a lousy little punk!
-(grunting) Take it to your membership.

23:26.738 --> 23:29.408
Ms. Davenport. Excuse me.

23:29.491 --> 23:30.659
Um...

23:31.785 --> 23:33.286
I got a situation at the precinct--

23:33.370 --> 23:36.665
Oh, don't you people learn?
She's on strike.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.167
You wouldn't have to be a lawyer.

23:39.793 --> 23:40.877
Please.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.839
-It'll have to be fast.
-Thank you.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.299
I'll be seeing you.

23:49.928 --> 23:53.515
MAN: See a human detonate himself,
ladies and gentlemen.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.852
In exchange
for your generous contributions,

23:56.935 --> 24:00.605
Professor Explosion will blow himself
to smithereens.

24:00.689 --> 24:04.317
Where you been? That guy's been going
at it for over an hour.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.486
-Nobody's coming into my store.
-I know, lady.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.989
We're gonna take it. You take the crowd,
I'm gonna take the talker.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.366
Okay, let's move it along, folks. Come on.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.411
-TINA: Come on.
-Any donations. Any amount right here.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.413
Hey, come on,
let the guy rock and roll, huh?

24:16.496 --> 24:17.831
Come on, move it back.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.541
The perp will be gone any minute now.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.710
Sir, you're blocking the sidewalk.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.503
It's a public place. You got to get out.

24:23.587 --> 24:27.174
Huh? Burst ear drum in 1954.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.134
The great Tallahassee blow.

24:29.843 --> 24:33.096
You're blocking the sidewalk.
You have to leave.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.557
As soon as he raises the money,

24:35.640 --> 24:38.018
Professor Explosion will surround himself

24:38.101 --> 24:41.229
with 20 pounds of dynamite, 20 pounds.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.857
Hey, my wallet.
Hey, you got my wallet, sucker.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.401
-Give me my wallet!
-He's got a knife!

24:46.485 --> 24:48.653
(clamoring)

24:49.613 --> 24:51.656
Take it, man. (groans)

24:51.740 --> 24:53.533
It didn't have to be like that.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.620
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.330
I got a paramedic.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.541
Listen, this is not the right day for you,
ding-dong,

25:01.625 --> 25:02.959
so you got to get out of here.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.837
I want you to know,

25:06.546 --> 25:09.883
I never saw that unfortunate man
in my life.

25:09.966 --> 25:12.260
I'm not a mere stall for a pickpocket.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.595
I'm an artist.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.976
Short and sweet, Mr. Flowers.

25:20.060 --> 25:23.146
I, along with the other public defenders,
am on strike.

25:23.230 --> 25:27.025
Whatever happened to neither rain
nor snow nor any of that stuff--?

25:27.108 --> 25:28.985
That's the postal service. The point is--

25:29.069 --> 25:35.367
No, the point is these people want a name
of a guy I possibly cashed a check for.

25:35.450 --> 25:38.328
Seems maybe he croaked
a couple of old folks.

25:39.037 --> 25:44.125
Now I figure we are crazy not to fold
my federal beef into the same package.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.003
I am not giving you legal advice,

25:47.379 --> 25:51.049
but Mr. Domarecki here can fold in

25:51.132 --> 25:53.260
those agreements on
your outstanding charges

25:53.343 --> 25:55.929
with the federal prosecutor
just as well as I can.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.473
I brought the pertinent files.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.811
-Well, I'll have to bone up on those.
-Bone up on those, right.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.772
How did I know he was gonna say that?

26:06.940 --> 26:08.733
Do you want to know what I say?

26:08.817 --> 26:11.778
-What?
-No way.

26:14.656 --> 26:18.326
Ms. Davenport.
Couldn't you call this federal guy?

26:18.410 --> 26:21.454
I've done everything that I can,
Detective. Have Mr. Domarecki--

26:21.538 --> 26:24.374
(scoffs) Mr. Domarecki can't walk
and chew gum at the same time.

26:24.457 --> 26:27.043
Detective,
I came here instead of going directly

26:27.127 --> 26:29.087
to report a new offer to the membership.

26:29.838 --> 26:33.258
I recommended to Mr. Flowers
that he accept new counsel.

26:33.341 --> 26:34.926
Now I'm asking you to do one more thing.

26:35.010 --> 26:38.722
If I phone the federal prosecutor,
I'm acting as Flowers' attorney

26:38.805 --> 26:40.015
and I will not do that.

26:40.974 --> 26:41.808
Please, excuse me.

26:43.810 --> 26:45.812
Come on. Get in there.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.357
-Howard.
-Oh, Judas.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.693
Raymond,
would you ice another one, please?

26:54.112 --> 26:55.614
Listen, Sergeant, we are so undermanned

26:55.697 --> 26:58.700
that I'm gonna have to turn you
right around and send you back out.

26:59.868 --> 27:04.539
Eighth and Piedmont. Man is--
He's gonna explode himself?

27:05.248 --> 27:06.833
-(groans)
-Can you believe it?

27:06.916 --> 27:10.211
Neal, J.D., Mick's perp continues
his refusal to cooperate.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.797
I want to use a search warrant
on his store.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.466
Maybe there's a diary, a list.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.926
Something with a name pinned to it

27:17.010 --> 27:19.262
that might give us whoever he was
buying the stolen checks from.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.430
You got it, Captain.

27:22.557 --> 27:23.391
Mick.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.354
You're the arresting officer.
I'll need you in court.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.147
(groans)

27:29.230 --> 27:32.400
(drumming on dash)

27:36.154 --> 27:38.698
Hey, let me guess. Gene Krupa?

27:39.783 --> 27:42.494
Sorry. I just keep thinking about Daniels

27:42.577 --> 27:45.205
giving me the runaround
on that black tar task force.

27:45.288 --> 27:48.333
I sent my proposal three and a half
months ago on this thing.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.877
I stopped counting at
the eighth broken appointment.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.880
Hard to figure that stuff be
such high priority, Lieutenant.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.091
It's cheaper than regular smack.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.677
Junkies don't have to rob
as much to stay high.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.679
Plus, more of them OD, right, Norm?

28:01.596 --> 28:02.847
Policeman's helper.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.767
If we had a task force, we could nail
major dealers like Echevarria.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.478
Instead, we're tailing his flunky to get
a guy we already had in custody.

28:08.561 --> 28:11.898
Yeah, well, <i>que sera, sera</i> . Check it out.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.486
HENRY: Good day, Norm.
Guy in the doorway is Gomez.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.782
NORMAN: If that greaseball leaves
the chick in the red dress

28:20.865 --> 28:23.535
sitting in the car,
I'm gonna go up and slash his tires.

28:24.911 --> 28:25.912
Wait a second.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.750
Ooh, come on, baby. Shake it, mama.

28:33.128 --> 28:36.548
HENRY: They say the place upstairs
is where Echevarria stashes,

28:36.631 --> 28:38.174
but his attorney
had him renovate the building

28:38.258 --> 28:40.093
so there's no legal address.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.222
Hey, wait, wait.

28:44.305 --> 28:45.765
What do you say, Lieutenant?

28:45.849 --> 28:48.560
-Want to start our own task force?
-What do you mean?

28:49.060 --> 28:51.688
That's supposed to be Echevarria's
stash pad, right?

28:51.771 --> 28:53.606
-That's the information.
-All right.

28:53.690 --> 28:57.610
So first we pop Zorro there,
then we head upstairs for fun and games.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.029
-Huh?
-No warrant?

29:00.113 --> 29:02.365
Lieutenant,
you want the good cops medallion

29:02.449 --> 29:05.535
or you want to put some crabs
in Echevarria's jockey shorts, huh?

29:07.829 --> 29:09.330
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.214
Hey, man. Hey, man.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.675
-Forget it.
-Hey, man, can you help me?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.886
I just got here from Jamaica today, man.

29:22.969 --> 29:26.347
I brought my family fortune with me.
See here?

29:26.806 --> 29:29.893
Lame hustle, bad rug.
Go on, beat it, Calypso.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.104
In your ear, man.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.234
Mr. Gomez. Police, you're busted.

29:38.318 --> 29:40.612
-You can't do that.
-We can't, huh?

29:41.905 --> 29:45.325
You know, part of the task force's job
is education, right, Lieutenant?

29:45.408 --> 29:46.618
See you upstairs.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.666
-(knocks)
-Police!

29:53.750 --> 29:55.126
You got three to open up.

29:55.376 --> 29:56.461
-(toilet flushes)
-One!

29:56.544 --> 29:59.255
ECHEVARRIA: Yeah, just a minute.
Hey, hold your horses, all right?

29:59.339 --> 30:00.548
Two!

30:03.134 --> 30:04.928
We got one more, Echevarria.

30:05.011 --> 30:07.180
ECHEVARRIA:
Just relax, all right? We're going.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.224
-Three!
-ECHEVARRIA: Yeah, yeah.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.981
Where's the warrant?

30:17.065 --> 30:19.859
Detective, present the man
with his warrant.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.990
I thought you had the warrant, Detective.

30:26.574 --> 30:29.869
Oh, no. We must have made a mistake,
then, huh?

30:29.953 --> 30:32.497
And all that dope
flushed down the tubes, too.

30:34.123 --> 30:38.044
You are very stupid if you think
you've accomplished anything.

30:38.127 --> 30:42.257
Well, now we just thought you might like
to say adios to Gomez here.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.925
He's going away for a while.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.261
Maybe you'll see him soon.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.263
You have a nice day now, you hear?

30:48.346 --> 30:50.014
Come on, let's go.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.891
(laughs)

30:54.018 --> 30:56.271
(siren blaring)

31:00.733 --> 31:03.152
(Professor Explosion shouting)

31:05.113 --> 31:07.782
RENKO (on megaphone): All right,
Professor, put the dynamite down.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.160
-Nice and easy.
-Fruit cake with dynamite.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.581
All right, Professor,
unhook yourself from that dynamite

31:14.664 --> 31:17.959
and give us a chance to get organized
over here, please.

31:18.042 --> 31:21.921
It will amaze you. It will delight you.

31:23.423 --> 31:26.593
Now, Professor, you really don't want
to blow yourself up, now do you?

31:26.676 --> 31:28.011
It's a living.

31:28.094 --> 31:30.471
Professor, put down the dynamite.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.015
Oh, I can't.

31:32.599 --> 31:36.519
I can't disappoint my public.
They expect detonation.

31:36.603 --> 31:37.979
Well, they're not gonna get it.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.357
Now, Professor, you're endangering
the lives of innocent people--

31:41.441 --> 31:43.234
No, never!

31:43.318 --> 31:45.278
The professor knows all there is to know

31:45.361 --> 31:49.324
about force vectors,
thermodynamic venting.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.285
I was blowing myself up
when you were in diapers.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.745
We're not gonna let you do it.

31:53.828 --> 31:57.040
I don't think this man
is exactly from this here planet.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.750
Too risky to try a sniper, Sarge?

31:58.833 --> 32:00.627
Not with that detonator in his hand.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.046
Sarge, if this guy's
doing it for the money,

32:03.129 --> 32:05.214
maybe we could pay him
more to call it off.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.425
-Good idea.
-Yeah? Who's gonna make the delivery?

32:07.508 --> 32:10.303
Hell, I will. This guy is harmless.

32:10.386 --> 32:12.555
-Come on, come on. Fork some money over.
-All right.

32:12.639 --> 32:15.892
You know, I don't think this is
the firmest investment I ever made.

32:15.975 --> 32:18.102
One minute, ladies and gentlemen.

32:18.186 --> 32:21.272
-(cheering)
-One minute, ladies and gentlemen.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.859
One minute. One minute.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.986
One minute.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.696
Officer coming through.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.326
Hey, Flaherty, be careful out there.
The guy's a real whacko.

32:33.409 --> 32:35.161
This guy's an entrepreneur.

32:36.412 --> 32:37.288
Duck.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.500
-Yo, Professor.
-Stay back.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.920
I cannot guarantee
the safety of interlopers.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.923
Professor, we got some money here for you

32:47.006 --> 32:49.717
if you'll just put this thing off
till tomorrow.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.678
Yo, Professor.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.389
How much?

32:54.472 --> 32:57.225
Oh, I don't know. We got about $100.

32:57.308 --> 33:00.019
-Drop it in.
-You got to cut this out now.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.813
Are you doubting my word?

33:02.397 --> 33:03.231
I'll come out.

33:04.524 --> 33:05.692
Drop it in, I promise.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.948
Ok, now, let's go, Professor.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.326
There's less than $50 here!

33:15.410 --> 33:17.203
Hey, what do you want? We gave you--

33:17.286 --> 33:19.288
Ten, nine...

33:19.372 --> 33:21.791
Get out of there.
Get out of there, Flaherty!

33:22.083 --> 33:23.626
-Professor.
-...eight...

33:23.710 --> 33:25.753
-Oh, come on, Professor.
-...seven...

33:25.837 --> 33:27.171
Flaherty, come on, come on, come on.

33:27.255 --> 33:30.299
...six, five...

33:30.967 --> 33:32.635
What, are you a psychiatrist or something?

33:33.511 --> 33:37.557
...three, two, one.

33:43.229 --> 33:44.647
See, I told you.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.739
Nice plan. Nice plan.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.034
Professor!

33:58.327 --> 33:59.245
Yo!

34:00.288 --> 34:01.456
Professor!

34:07.962 --> 34:09.255
(chattering)

34:09.338 --> 34:12.133
And what about a humane pay scale?

34:12.508 --> 34:16.387
Cost of living adjustments?
Decent medical coverage?

34:16.471 --> 34:18.139
Are any of these things unreasonable?

34:18.222 --> 34:20.975
-No.
-Well, then let's get them.

34:22.351 --> 34:25.229
The city is on its knees.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.316
Let's take our best shot.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.902
Vote to keep the strike alive.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.404
(cheering)

34:33.488 --> 34:34.655
Joyce.

34:36.032 --> 34:38.701
We went on strike because the city
made it impossible

34:38.785 --> 34:41.496
for us to give our clients
adequate representation.

34:42.205 --> 34:45.416
Under this proposal
the jobs would be restored.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.127
-You like handling a caseload of 300?
-Let her talk.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.839
In answer to Ms. Greene, no, I don't.

34:53.674 --> 34:56.969
But to prolong this strike
to get additional concessions

34:57.053 --> 34:58.971
discredits our integrity.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.682
And while we fight on,

35:02.642 --> 35:04.185
people who are homeless,

35:05.269 --> 35:07.230
unjustly accused of crimes,

35:07.980 --> 35:09.232
helpless people,

35:09.982 --> 35:11.400
will continue to suffer.

35:11.776 --> 35:16.155
We got what we asked for and I am voting
to end the strike and go back to work.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.449
-MAN: Hear, hear.
-And I urge you to do the same.

35:18.533 --> 35:22.453
(cheering)

35:22.537 --> 35:25.957
All right, people. Time to vote.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.210
(overlapping chatter)

35:29.919 --> 35:32.130
-DANNY: Joyce.
-What?

35:33.005 --> 35:34.132
Congratulations.

35:34.590 --> 35:36.509
They couldn't have counted
the votes that fast.

35:36.592 --> 35:39.053
Come on, Joyce. You know you won.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.597
You brought the sheep back into the fold.

35:42.056 --> 35:45.143
If you're saying prevailing sentiment
was for settlement,

35:45.226 --> 35:47.770
I think you're right,
but I don't think it was my doing.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.398
You really don't get it, do you, Joyce?

35:51.149 --> 35:53.401
Every so often there's a window open.

35:53.901 --> 35:58.781
Somehow the fat cats slip up
and the working stiffs get a chance.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.700
Danny, maybe it's shortsighted of me,

36:00.783 --> 36:04.537
but I don't see this as part of some
historical dialectic.

36:05.329 --> 36:08.791
All I know is my work is important to me
and I want a chance to do it.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.752
Well, if you thought that 100 percent,

36:11.836 --> 36:14.297
you wouldn't have swung
on Wachtel yesterday.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.926
I guess I don't buy anything 100 percent.

36:19.677 --> 36:22.680
I'm going to court in case we settle.
You want me to drop you someplace?

36:22.763 --> 36:24.182
No, I'm gonna wait inside.

36:25.057 --> 36:27.226
I'll see if I can jimmy the ballots.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.188
I'll see you.

36:32.481 --> 36:34.567
MICK: Give us a name, hairball.

36:34.650 --> 36:37.445
-You're pushing your luck.
-You blame me?

36:37.528 --> 36:39.989
Infrequent enough a guy like me
gets a little leverage.

36:40.072 --> 36:42.825
The trick is knowing how to apply it,
Mr. Flowers.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.077
-Hey, fellas.
-One moment, please, Your Honor.

36:45.161 --> 36:48.581
Look, I want those other charges dropped.
Those two other check things.

36:48.664 --> 36:50.166
We're dropping our part of it.

36:50.249 --> 36:52.919
You see, the federal charges
are not in their control.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.463
-The social security checks--
-Butt out.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.632
Look, she was dealing with
the federal prosecutor.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.175
They were putting together a package.

36:59.258 --> 37:02.011
We have been unable to secure
federal agreement as of yet,

37:02.094 --> 37:04.889
Mr. Flowers, but I promise you,
giving the police the name they're after

37:04.972 --> 37:06.641
will only help your federal situation.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.143
Look, I understand you guys
are in a hurry.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.520
An addict is attacking
and killing old people.

37:11.604 --> 37:14.482
But I got to get what I can out of this.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.859
No name till I get the whole deal.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.486
Look at this.
Everything's falling apart here.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.071
Hey, look at this.

37:20.821 --> 37:22.615
Federal prosecutor's agreed to waive

37:22.698 --> 37:25.243
in exchange for your cooperation
with the city police.

37:26.118 --> 37:27.119
There.

37:27.536 --> 37:29.080
Now wasn't that easy?

37:29.163 --> 37:30.873
Name, hairball.

37:30.957 --> 37:35.253
Excuse me. You and I have got some
outstanding business, Ms. Davenport.

37:36.170 --> 37:39.382
Your Honor, I'm not representing
this client in business before the court.

37:39.465 --> 37:42.009
Oh, please approach.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.268
(clears throat) Your Honor.

37:51.560 --> 37:56.774
I apologize for my unprofessional conduct
at my last appearance before the bench.

37:56.857 --> 37:58.901
You hit me with a hell of a right.

37:59.902 --> 38:03.364
Mr. Flowers is my client in several other
proceedings, Your Honor.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.660
We've just worked out an agreement
that will be beneficial to all parties.

38:08.244 --> 38:09.328
Regardless of my status--

38:09.412 --> 38:13.124
You see, I thought you were playing games
in my courtroom, Ms. Davenport.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.668
I know you felt that way.

38:16.585 --> 38:18.337
I assure you that was not my intention.

38:18.421 --> 38:22.049
I know I got provocative. That was why.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.844
I'm sorry I responded that way.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.514
I've had the record revised
to grant recess

38:28.597 --> 38:30.558
when you requested it yesterday.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.478
Subsequent events are, um, hm...

38:35.771 --> 38:36.856
off the record.

38:37.523 --> 38:38.983
I appreciate that, Your Honor.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.277
That should square you with the bar.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.571
You guys back to work?

38:43.654 --> 38:45.865
-I hope so, Your Honor.
-You know, Joycie,

38:47.199 --> 38:49.493
I look at you and you are beautiful.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.371
Mm. Got a few bucks.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.624
But I get the feeling
you're just visiting.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.046
I have to live here.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.672
I assure you, Your Honor,

39:02.006 --> 39:04.425
that I'm no visitor.
This is my house, too.

39:05.551 --> 39:06.552
Good.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.138
All right, step back.

39:12.808 --> 39:13.809
Bernstein.

39:16.145 --> 39:19.857
-The people waive prosecution, Your Honor.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dismissed.

39:19.940 --> 39:20.775
(bangs gavel)

39:20.858 --> 39:21.901
Go ahead.

39:23.235 --> 39:24.278
Come on!

39:26.030 --> 39:30.409
Joey Summers. Lives in the Genesee Hotel.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.748
Okay, here you go.

39:36.540 --> 39:37.708
There's one.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.128
There's two. Two for the price of one.
Today only.

39:45.007 --> 39:47.051
J.D., this ain't working, babe.
Let's call it.

39:47.843 --> 39:49.804
Patience, Neal. Patience.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.348
But this is wrong, man.
We only have a warrant to search.

39:52.431 --> 39:54.433
Don't say nothing about opening up
this place for business.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.810
J.D.: Hey, hey, check it out.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.238
(humming)

40:12.118 --> 40:14.912
-Hey, Manny around, man?
-Mm-mm, out sick.

40:15.746 --> 40:16.705
When will he be back?

40:17.623 --> 40:19.500
Why? You need something?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.168
You know what the split is?

40:21.252 --> 40:24.380
-The usual.
-(chuckles) I'll wait for Manny.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.590
Hey, yo, man!

40:26.674 --> 40:30.010
Hey, you cheated me out of my share, man!

40:30.094 --> 40:32.179
Uh-uh, uh-uh, that ain't right.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.472
That ain't right.

40:33.556 --> 40:36.058
Now, I take all the risks
and then you gonna take me, Jack?

40:36.142 --> 40:38.686
-Pal, you want to keep it down?
-I want what's coming to me.

40:38.769 --> 40:41.313
All right. Hey, cool your jets. Now here.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.357
Here's your lousy 50 bucks, huh?

40:43.441 --> 40:44.775
-Now take a hike.
-Chump.

40:48.571 --> 40:49.780
(door bell jingles)

40:51.449 --> 40:54.827
Sixty-forty split, man.
And don't try to do me.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.039
Abraham Levinson.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.751
Hey, that's the guy who got killed
last night, isn't it?

41:03.502 --> 41:05.045
Don't move, my man. Police.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.381
What he means is spread 'em.

41:11.677 --> 41:14.388
Come on, stand up straight,
will you, Desi, huh?

41:14.889 --> 41:17.892
You know, I got real excited
when I heard they cut you loose.

41:17.975 --> 41:19.185
I love mistakes like that.

41:19.268 --> 41:22.229
It means we get a second chance
to rearrange your chops.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.314
(chuckles)

41:23.397 --> 41:24.857
You got his paper, Lieutenant?

41:26.108 --> 41:29.862
You know, uh, we'll be real sure
to tell your buddy Echevarria

41:29.945 --> 41:32.156
that you're not giving him up in here.

41:32.239 --> 41:34.283
I mean,
you're not giving us chapter and verse

41:34.366 --> 41:36.827
of every single freakin' thing he does.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.079
(laughs) Pepe.

41:40.581 --> 41:43.250
If I get real lucky,
they'll cut you loose again, you know?

41:43.334 --> 41:45.961
Maybe we'll get to play
a sudden death overtime, huh.

41:46.504 --> 41:50.883
Now, don't steal any bongos, all right?
(chuckles)

41:50.966 --> 41:53.761
Not enough people
remember Desi for his music.

41:55.971 --> 41:56.805
You don't like it, right?

41:59.308 --> 42:00.351
I got to admit it.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.730
Lieutenant, I want my perp

42:04.813 --> 42:07.399
the minute he sets foot on my turf,
I want him scared.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.693
That makes up for all
the legal mumbo jumbo

42:09.777 --> 42:11.111
they get the benefit of later on.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.364
You mean that mumbo jumbo
about representation,

42:13.447 --> 42:15.950
the right to confront one's accuser,
like that?

42:16.033 --> 42:17.326
Booking is an important part

42:17.409 --> 42:19.745
in the criminal's journey
through the legal system, you know.

42:19.828 --> 42:23.958
It helps us maximize the benefits
of our law enforcement dollars.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.918
-(chuckles)
-Maybe you're right, Norm.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.754
I don't see me getting my task force.

42:28.837 --> 42:30.047
How about a cold, frosty lager?

42:32.132 --> 42:34.051
-Twist my arm.
-You mean that?

42:39.473 --> 42:41.058
Am I understanding this right?

42:41.141 --> 42:44.436
You go into the fences' hardware store
on a warrant to search

42:44.520 --> 42:47.356
and instead of searching,
you open up for business?

42:47.439 --> 42:51.068
What Belker is trying to say, Neal,
is, "Guys, thanks for helping.

42:51.151 --> 42:52.987
Thanks for popping Joey Summers."

42:53.070 --> 42:54.446
What if he claims entrapment, John?

42:54.530 --> 42:56.949
-No way.
-Dude came to us, Mick.

42:57.032 --> 42:58.242
He was ready to do business.

42:58.325 --> 43:00.035
I'm telling you guys, a sharp attorney--

43:00.119 --> 43:01.120
Will you give it a rest, Mick?

43:01.203 --> 43:03.455
-The case makes.
-It can unmake.

43:03.539 --> 43:06.792
They can say the bust
was proceeds of a misapplied warrant.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.836
Young Clarence Darrow.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.214
Two minutes off a picket line,
I'm hip-deep in felons.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.758
They got your signature
on that dead guy's check?

43:14.842 --> 43:16.969
Guess I should have signed it left-handed.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.763
That was a weak stall at that store, man.

43:19.847 --> 43:21.599
Look like you bought it, small time.

43:22.099 --> 43:24.518
All right, look, I'll look over this stuff
when I get the chance.

43:24.602 --> 43:27.646
Top of my head,
we plead what they give us.

43:27.730 --> 43:28.897
Take him to holding.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.774
NEAL: Busy as the PDs are, Mick,

43:30.858 --> 43:33.319
-I think we're gonna be okay.
-Now will you relax?

43:33.402 --> 43:34.737
(scoffs)

43:41.535 --> 43:42.369
Howard.

43:43.912 --> 43:46.081
-Captain.
-What did you think?

43:47.333 --> 43:49.251
I had duties, I performed them.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.212
Well, you have a choice here, Howard.

43:52.713 --> 43:54.089
Tell me if you like the job.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.509
It was hardly my choice
to be demoted, Captain.

44:02.431 --> 44:05.100
But, if I am to be a sergeant...

44:07.603 --> 44:09.396
This is the sergeant I'd like to be.

44:14.026 --> 44:17.279
Aw, Renko. Would you please?

44:17.363 --> 44:19.531
My feet hurt me so bad.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.867
I'm gonna tell you something,
I'm never gonna permit myself

44:21.950 --> 44:23.327
to get put on foot patrol again.

44:23.410 --> 44:26.372
I think walking a beat puts you
back in touch with the precinct,

44:26.455 --> 44:29.124
though it does have its downside.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.377
Renko, is this-- what?

44:32.169 --> 44:33.545
RENKO: What do you think of him?

44:33.921 --> 44:35.839
-BOBBY: Flaherty?
-Yeah.

44:35.923 --> 44:38.092
I mean, he showed me
some intestinal fortitude

44:38.175 --> 44:39.510
facing up that professor today

44:39.593 --> 44:41.553
with all that dynamite
strapped to his body.

44:42.471 --> 44:45.391
-But still--
-Renko, she's got to ride with someone.

44:45.808 --> 44:47.017
Yeah, I suppose.

44:48.268 --> 44:49.687
Mm...

44:49.770 --> 44:51.772
-Oh!
-Enough.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.190
Excuse my fingers.

44:53.273 --> 44:55.109
(chuckles)

44:55.192 --> 44:56.276
Flaherty.

44:57.903 --> 44:59.321
Patrick, uh...

45:01.657 --> 45:04.743
maybe this is the wrong time.

45:04.827 --> 45:07.996
-I should wait.
-Sergeant, proceed.

45:09.248 --> 45:10.833
It's about Professor Explosion.

45:10.916 --> 45:13.377
-Yeah.
-About your idea.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.504
-My brilliant idea.
-Yeah.

45:16.255 --> 45:17.923
Which, uh, backfired.

45:18.006 --> 45:20.926
Even if it hadn't, you were wrong.
I mean, you should never have tried that.

45:21.009 --> 45:22.428
Figured I'd take a shot.

45:22.511 --> 45:25.514
Yeah, but, Patrick, procedure is
the bomb squad does the business.

45:25.597 --> 45:27.516
Uniforms provide backup

45:27.599 --> 45:30.018
and deal with the safety of the crowds.
That's it.

45:30.102 --> 45:31.854
Bomb squad wasn't doing nothing.

45:31.937 --> 45:33.605
The bomb squad was
getting ready to do something.

45:37.359 --> 45:40.404
Sorry, forgive
the office lecture afterhours.

45:40.487 --> 45:42.030
Why didn't you tell me at the time?

45:43.824 --> 45:45.701
I really haven't figured
that out yet. I...

45:46.076 --> 45:49.037
I guess I just got caught up
in watching you.

45:50.998 --> 45:53.375
-Anyway...
-Anyway.

45:55.169 --> 45:56.545
Welcome to the Hill.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.847
Ed Andrews says you gave quite a speech.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.684
I think I made an enemy
out of Danny Santana.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.686
Danny Santana is his own enemy.

46:12.978 --> 46:15.939
He talked to me after
we had voted to go back.

46:17.191 --> 46:21.236
Said that I had cost us a chance
to change how we do our jobs.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.198
There's a kind of guy
who doesn't want solutions, you know?

46:24.281 --> 46:25.991
He just wants to keep the pot boiling.

46:26.074 --> 46:27.367
I ain't one of them.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.497
Hope you're not sick of this hotel.

46:31.830 --> 46:33.874
Actually, I couldn't believe it

46:34.708 --> 46:38.337
when you said you had made
a dinner reservation here of all places.

46:40.005 --> 46:42.466
How do you feel about room 317?

46:50.933 --> 46:53.268
(monitor beeping)

46:55.145 --> 46:56.146
Look.

46:57.314 --> 46:58.315
An angel.

46:58.899 --> 47:00.150
Hi, Sarge.

47:02.236 --> 47:03.821
I came through, huh?

47:04.988 --> 47:06.073
You came through.

47:08.700 --> 47:09.993
I guess that's good.

47:12.830 --> 47:15.123
-Mick.
-How you feeling, Stan?

47:15.666 --> 47:18.126
Okay, unless I'm hallucinating.

47:19.002 --> 47:20.838
Doctor said you made it
through the tough part.

47:20.921 --> 47:23.423
-He said you're gonna be fine.
-No kidding?

47:23.507 --> 47:26.218
He's gonna be in here in a second.
You ask him yourself.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.096
Mouth feels like it's full of cotton.

47:32.558 --> 47:33.684
Here, take a sip of this.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.442
Boy, that's good.

47:46.446 --> 47:50.284
(chuckles) I'm alive.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.662
I'm alive.

48:03.130 --> 48:06.133
(closing theme playing)
