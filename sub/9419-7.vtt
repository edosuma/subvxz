At my stomach, and I was like...

Then suddenly, out of the blue,

02:04.758 --> 02:06.658
He disappeared.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.593
His myspace account was

02:07.595 --> 02:08.526
Deleted.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.394
He no longer called,

02:09.395 --> 02:10.395
And I couldn't get ahold of

02:10.396 --> 02:11.497
Him in any way.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.865
I felt abandoned.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.399
Had I done something wrong?

02:14.401 --> 02:15.801
For two years, I sat through

02:15.803 --> 02:17.503
My mistrust when, out of

02:17.505 --> 02:18.537
The blue, I got a message

02:18.539 --> 02:20.506
From elijah on facebook.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.141
He was searching for me.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.041
We started up communication

02:23.043 --> 02:24.576
Again, but I wasn't over

02:24.578 --> 02:25.911
His disappearance and didn't

02:25.913 --> 02:26.945
Really trust him.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.847
The real elijah that I'mis

02:28.849 --> 02:29.815
Talking to?

02:29.817 --> 02:30.949
Over the years, elijah and I

02:30.951 --> 02:32.284
Have never video chatted.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.418
He doesn't have a webcam,

02:33.420 --> 02:34.419
And the last time we spoke on

02:34.421 --> 02:36.889
The phone was six years ago

02:36.891 --> 02:38.357
When I was 14, before his

02:38.359 --> 02:40.092
Myspace account was deleted.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.161
We now only message on a text

02:42.163 --> 02:44.463
App and on facebook.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.964
I have recently met a guy here

02:45.966 --> 02:46.798
In delaware.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.966
His is name is danny.

02:47.968 --> 02:48.767
He really wants to move our

02:48.769 --> 02:49.635
Relationship to the next

02:49.637 --> 02:51.637
Level, but in my mind,

02:51.639 --> 02:53.272
I keep thinking about elijah

02:53.274 --> 02:55.541
And what could have been.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.542
I need to know whether I should

02:56.544 --> 02:58.343
Move on with my life or

02:58.345 --> 02:59.778
Potentially move forward

02:59.780 --> 03:00.712
With elijah.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.182
Best regards, solana.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.416
She can't shake this guy,

03:04.418 --> 03:07.386
This mystery crush.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.687
>> elusive elijah.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.454
>> let's get her on

03:09.456 --> 03:11.156
The old horn.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.791
Solana.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.059
>> hello.

03:14.061 --> 03:14.960
>> hi.

03:14.962 --> 03:15.994
>> you have the big gauged

03:15.996 --> 03:17.196
Earrings there, huh?

03:17.198 --> 03:18.397
>> I have two.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.765
Like, one on each side.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.966
>> and what are you doing now

03:20.968 --> 03:22.134
In delaware?

03:22.136 --> 03:22.901
>> well, I work at, like,

03:22.903 --> 03:24.236
A salon spa.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.470
>> we just read your email.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.872
We've got a lot of questions.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.073
First of all, how did you

03:28.075 --> 03:29.675
Meet elijah?

03:29.677 --> 03:30.676
>> well, we talked a lot on

03:30.678 --> 03:31.877
Myspace and messaged back

03:31.879 --> 03:32.778
And forth.

03:32.780 --> 03:33.645
He was always giving me

03:33.647 --> 03:34.780
Good advice and really, like,

03:34.782 --> 03:36.348
There for me when I didn't

03:36.350 --> 03:37.649
Know anybody else.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.584
Our relationship just kind of

03:38.586 --> 03:40.152
Grew really fast, and, like,

03:40.154 --> 03:41.920
I confided in him and told him

03:41.922 --> 03:42.988
All my secrets.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.890
>> and then one day, just--

03:44.892 --> 03:46.358
He went offline?

03:46.360 --> 03:47.359
>> one day, I signed on to

03:47.361 --> 03:48.760
Myspace to, like, message him,

03:48.762 --> 03:50.062
And his profile was just

03:50.064 --> 03:51.296
Completely gone.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.732
>> wow.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.600
>> it just said, "the user

03:54.602 --> 03:56.501
Does not exist."

03:56.503 --> 03:58.337
At first, I was really sad,

03:58.339 --> 03:59.338
And, like, I kind of thought,

03:59.340 --> 04:00.239
Like, maybe I did

04:00.241 --> 04:01.540
Something wrong.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.008
>> but two years after elijah

04:03.010 --> 04:05.177
Disappears on myspace, all of

04:05.179 --> 04:06.011
A sudden, he pops up

04:06.013 --> 04:07.112
On facebook.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.513
>> yeah, exactly.

04:08.515 --> 04:09.815
He messaged me saying, "well,

04:09.817 --> 04:11.149
I used to talk to a girl named

04:11.151 --> 04:12.084
Solana, and, like, I'm hoping

04:12.086 --> 04:13.352
It's you, and if it's you,

04:13.354 --> 04:14.653
Like, reply to me."

04:14.655 --> 04:15.420
I didn't want to let someone

04:15.422 --> 04:16.588
Back into my life that was just

04:16.589 --> 04:17.889
Gonna walk out.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.458
And I told him to text me,

04:19.459 --> 04:21.093
But he didn't have a phone.

04:21.095 --> 04:21.760
>> what do you mean,

04:21.762 --> 04:22.928
He didn't have a phone?

04:22.930 --> 04:23.762
>> he still doesn't.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.231
>> do you really believe that?

04:26.233 --> 04:27.232
>> not really.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.267
I mean, I don't know.

04:28.269 --> 04:28.967
>> I mean, everybody has

04:28.969 --> 04:29.768
A phone.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.236
>> he has a texting app on

04:31.238 --> 04:32.437
An ipod.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.539
>> you are still holding on

04:34.541 --> 04:35.440
To this.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.108
>> yeah.

04:36.110 --> 04:36.942
There's a big question

04:36.944 --> 04:38.977
Lingering from my past.

04:38.979 --> 04:39.911
>> but you've also started

04:39.913 --> 04:41.513
Dating this danny guy.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.614
>> I really like danny,

04:42.616 --> 04:43.448
And he's good to me,

04:43.450 --> 04:44.449
Which is really awesome.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.450
He's a great guy.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.318
>> does he know that you

04:46.320 --> 04:47.219
Reached out to us?

04:47.221 --> 04:48.053
>> yeah, I told him, and

04:48.055 --> 04:50.188
Honestly, he really wants me

04:50.190 --> 04:53.191
To be happy, so he's been

04:53.193 --> 04:54.593
Supportive, which is really

04:54.595 --> 04:55.894
Awesome, because most guys

04:55.896 --> 04:57.462
Would be like, "screw you.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.196
I'm out of here."

04:58.198 --> 05:00.265
>> inviting us to come into your

05:00.267 --> 05:02.634
Life and connect you with

05:02.636 --> 05:04.369
Elijah is only gonna

05:04.371 --> 05:06.271
Cause waves.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.339
Are you ready for that?

05:07.341 --> 05:08.473
>> I just need to solve this

05:08.475 --> 05:09.308
Thing, because it's been

05:09.310 --> 05:11.176
Lingering, and it's been

05:11.178 --> 05:12.644
Basically holding me back from

05:12.646 --> 05:14.780
Committing fully to danny,

05:14.782 --> 05:16.114
And that's not fair to him.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.249
Yeah, I don't want to wonder,

05:17.251 --> 05:18.984
"what if" about this person

05:18.986 --> 05:20.085
For the rest of my life.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.219
>> we want to help you,

05:21.221 --> 05:22.054
And I want to see if we can

05:22.056 --> 05:22.988
Figure this out.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.189
>> that's super awesome.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.457
Thank you so much.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.992

05:57.458 --> 05:58.690

05:58.692 --> 06:00.325
That when they met, they used

06:00.327 --> 06:01.193
To talk on the phone

06:01.195 --> 06:01.893
All the time.

06:01.895 --> 06:02.961
Then he disappears.

06:02.963 --> 06:03.929
He pops back up.

06:03.931 --> 06:04.663
>> right, and then after

06:04.665 --> 06:06.064

Talked on the phone since.

06:18.679 --> 06:19.444
>> give me a hug.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.246
>> both: Nice to meet you.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.414
>> nev, it's your turn now.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.382
>> yeah.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.549
>> have you spoken to elijah

06:24.551 --> 06:25.450
Recently?

06:25.452 --> 06:26.551
>> we usually text every day.

06:26.553 --> 06:27.219
Yeah.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.320
>> there's still that level of

06:28.322 --> 06:29.354
Excitement, like, when you get

06:29.356 --> 06:30.088
A text from him.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.690
>> oh, yeah, definitely.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.058
I'm always excited to have him

06:33.060 --> 06:34.025
Text me.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.294
>> how did it start with elijah?

06:36.296 --> 06:37.896
>> I was going through so much.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.532
I think that my dad and my mom

06:40.534 --> 06:41.933
Hated each other.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.101
And I was, like, daddy's girl

06:43.103 --> 06:44.536
Growing up, so I wanted to live

06:44.538 --> 06:45.404
With my dad.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.204
I moved to king george,

06:46.206 --> 06:46.872
Virginia.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.039
I was culture shocked and,

06:48.041 --> 06:50.075
Like, alone and bored,

06:50.077 --> 06:51.309
So elijah popped into my life

06:51.311 --> 06:52.377
And kind of fixed everything,

06:52.379 --> 06:53.145
Basically.

06:53.147 --> 06:53.812
Just, like, he made me

06:53.814 --> 06:54.980
Feel better.

06:54.982 --> 06:55.914
He made me forget about

06:55.916 --> 06:58.750
Everything that was going on.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.751
>> and so elijah is, like,

06:59.753 --> 07:01.153
Your best friend?

07:01.155 --> 07:01.820
>> mm-hmm.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.088
>> and your support system.

07:03.090 --> 07:03.755
>> exactly.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.357
>> and your boyfriend.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.425
>> eventually, yeah.

07:06.427 --> 07:07.659
After, like, a month or so of us

07:07.661 --> 07:09.461
Talking and feeling it out,

07:09.463 --> 07:10.362
He asked me to be his

07:10.364 --> 07:11.196
Girlfriend, even though--

07:11.198 --> 07:12.264
>> very quickly, you guys

07:12.266 --> 07:13.298
Started talking on the phone.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.966
>> well, he had a house phone,

07:14.968 --> 07:16.935
So I could let him call me,

07:16.937 --> 07:18.203
'cause I had a cell phone,

07:18.205 --> 07:19.171
But I wasn't allowed to call

07:19.173 --> 07:20.338
Him 'cause his mom was, like,

07:20.340 --> 07:22.707
Super strict if, like, she

07:22.709 --> 07:24.709
Caught me calling or whatever.

07:24.711 --> 07:25.510
>> and you kind of grieved for

07:25.512 --> 07:27.179
Him after he disappeared.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.413
>> definitely, yeah.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.614
I was really messed up,

07:29.616 --> 07:30.348
Honestly.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.183
For him to, like, give me

07:31.185 --> 07:32.551
Advice and tell me everything's

07:32.553 --> 07:34.052
Gonna be okay and then one day,

07:34.054 --> 07:35.587
Just be, like, completely gone--

07:35.589 --> 07:36.721
Maybe I pushed him away by,

07:36.723 --> 07:37.789
Like, telling him too much about

07:37.791 --> 07:38.690
My life.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.424
>> you don't hear from him,

07:39.426 --> 07:40.091
Nothing.

07:40.093 --> 07:40.759
>> not at all.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.526
>> and what are you feeling

07:41.528 --> 07:42.494
During that time?

07:42.496 --> 07:43.361
>> one day, I'd be super sad

07:43.363 --> 07:44.429
About it, and the next day,

07:44.431 --> 07:46.264
I'd just be, like, ticked off.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.132
But then I would always just try

07:47.134 --> 07:47.833
To push it in the back of

07:47.835 --> 07:49.267
My mind.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.403
>> so a year or so goes by

07:51.405 --> 07:52.838
Where you guys don't talk.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.105
>> out of the blue one day,

07:54.107 --> 07:55.240
I get a message on facebook

07:55.242 --> 07:56.675
From elijah.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.542
>> do you have messages?

07:57.544 --> 07:59.177
>> yeah, we do, and you can read

07:59.179 --> 08:00.712
Them and show him if you want.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.713
>> oh, wow, so this is

08:01.715 --> 08:03.215
The message he sent you...

08:03.217 --> 08:03.882
>> yeah.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.351
>> reconnecting back in 2012.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.052
>> slowly but surely,

08:07.054 --> 08:08.053
Our communication started

08:08.055 --> 08:09.020
Picking back up.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.289
And so he texted me from his

08:11.291 --> 08:13.358
App text number or whatever,

08:13.360 --> 08:14.359
And basically, we've just been

08:14.361 --> 08:15.327
Texting ever since.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.528
>> did you ask him what

08:16.530 --> 08:17.295
Happened?

08:17.297 --> 08:18.396
>> he told me his mom had him

08:18.398 --> 08:20.232
On lockdown and, like,

08:20.234 --> 08:21.566
Took his stuff away.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.434
Wouldn't let him have internet

08:22.436 --> 08:23.468
Access or phone access

08:23.470 --> 08:24.503
Or anything like that.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.438
>> have you ever asked elijah

08:26.440 --> 08:27.873
To video chat?

08:27.875 --> 08:28.740
>> I mean, I've asked him,

08:28.742 --> 08:30.509
But he doesn't have a webcam.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.311
>> do you buy his story?

08:33.313 --> 08:35.080
>> parts of it, yes, but

08:35.082 --> 08:37.048
There's a lot of, like, holes.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.149
I don't want to, like, accuse

08:38.150 --> 08:40.118
Someone who's done such nice

08:40.120 --> 08:42.386
Things for me of, like,

08:42.389 --> 08:43.788
Doing bad stuff.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.123
>> you were pursuing elijah

08:45.125 --> 08:45.857
There for a while,

08:45.859 --> 08:47.726
And he was pursuing you.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.494
Were you thinking it was leading

08:49.496 --> 08:51.329
To kind of a reboot?

08:51.331 --> 08:53.331
Sort of relationship 2.0?

08:53.333 --> 08:54.232
>> definitely our relationship

08:54.234 --> 08:55.333
Was, like, evolving.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.134
>> a couple of months later,

08:56.136 --> 08:57.335
You met danny.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.970
>> [sighs]

08:58.972 --> 09:01.673
Yeah, that was great timing.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.909
>> he's willing to let you

09:03.911 --> 09:06.311
Discover who elijah is.

09:06.313 --> 09:06.978
>> he just wants me to

09:06.980 --> 09:07.979
Be happy.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.848
>> do you think elijah kind of

09:09.850 --> 09:11.149
Could always be coming in and

09:11.151 --> 09:12.117
Out of your life?

09:12.119 --> 09:12.951
>> I would prefer if he would

09:12.953 --> 09:14.052
Just stay in my life, 'cause

09:14.054 --> 09:14.920
It's just confusing.

09:14.922 --> 09:15.754
It messes up my other

09:15.756 --> 09:16.555
Relationships.

09:16.557 --> 09:17.756
I just want something stable,

09:17.758 --> 09:18.757
Because my whole life has been

09:18.759 --> 09:19.858
Up and down and rocky and all

09:19.860 --> 09:20.792
Over the place.

09:20.794 --> 09:21.493
I just want, like, a safe

09:21.495 --> 09:22.861
Place, and I don't know if that

09:22.863 --> 09:24.596
Person can be elijah or not.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.498
>> you're sort of holding on to

09:26.500 --> 09:28.600
An idea that this guy that you

09:28.602 --> 09:29.868
Kind of fell in love with when

09:29.870 --> 09:32.704
You were 13 could be the one

09:32.706 --> 09:33.405
For you.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.239
>> yeah, it's like, torn

09:34.241 --> 09:35.707
Between the two.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.608
I want to know what elijah's

09:36.610 --> 09:38.109
Motives are, what he wants,

09:38.111 --> 09:39.344
What he's been thinking, and,

09:39.346 --> 09:41.079
Like, who he is, and, like,

09:41.081 --> 09:42.447
What's really going on.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.115
>> we're gonna go and research

09:44.117 --> 09:45.016
This guy.

09:45.018 --> 09:45.984
>> I'm excited.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.285
I'm scared excited.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.687
>> we got this.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.688
>> I'm glad.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.555
[laughs]

09:50.557 --> 09:51.222
Go.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.391
>> all right, see you later.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.060
>> if I were having any kind of

09:55.062 --> 09:56.394
Long-distance relationship

09:56.396 --> 09:57.662
With this girl, I would figure

09:57.664 --> 09:59.931
Out a way to get my ass

09:59.933 --> 10:00.599
Down here.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.366
>> oh, my god.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.233
So what does he want?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.134
And if it's just friendship,

10:03.136 --> 10:04.736
Then why not talk?

10:04.738 --> 10:05.637
And the reason she's freaking

10:05.639 --> 10:07.739
Out is because she sees that

10:07.741 --> 10:08.807
Danny is really into her and

10:08.809 --> 10:09.541
That he wants to move

10:09.543 --> 10:10.642
Things along.

10:10.644 --> 10:11.810
>> she definitely has some big

10:11.812 --> 10:13.778
Decisions coming up.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.847
It's not gonna be easy.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.984
>> all right, let's find

10:18.986 --> 10:19.651
A cozy spot.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.119
Right here.

10:21.121 --> 10:21.953
You know, my parents are

10:21.955 --> 10:22.921
Coming here.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.489
My mom just texted me.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.590
>> you're the only one that

10:25.592 --> 10:26.491
Should be allowed to talk

10:26.493 --> 10:27.525
About himself.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.426
You got catfished.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.661
Oh, boy.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.096
>> #relatable!

10:31.098 --> 10:31.896
>> [laughs]

10:31.898 --> 10:33.765
No one knows anything about me.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.600
>> let's keep it that way.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.335
Is this thing focused on me

10:37.337 --> 10:38.436
Well enough?

10:38.438 --> 10:40.138
>> where we do we start

10:40.140 --> 10:42.207
With elijah prok,

10:42.209 --> 10:44.409
Solana's online relationship?

10:44.411 --> 10:45.510
First things first.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.211
>> both: Who is the guy in

10:46.213 --> 10:48.013
The pictures?

10:48.015 --> 10:48.913
>> let's just search this

10:48.915 --> 10:49.681
Phone number.

10:49.683 --> 10:50.782
>> this is the first number that

10:50.784 --> 10:53.418
He gave her.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.553
We got something.

10:55.555 --> 10:56.421
>> what?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.490
>> she's 33.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.358
>> possible sister.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.459
Or maybe she could be

11:01.461 --> 11:03.862
Catfishing solana.

11:03.864 --> 11:04.629
What could have really

11:04.631 --> 11:06.431
Happened here is that solana

11:06.433 --> 11:09.034
The real guy back inntially,

11:09.036 --> 11:09.701
The myspace days.

11:09.703 --> 11:10.602
>> who could've been a girl.

11:10.604 --> 11:11.269
>> but they've been on

11:11.271 --> 11:11.936
The phone.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.071
>> they were both 13,

11:13.073 --> 11:14.205
So their voices could've both

11:14.207 --> 11:15.273
Been high.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.775
A girl could've passed as a guy,

11:16.777 --> 11:18.176
But now that it's four years

11:18.178 --> 11:19.778
Later and this boy, elijah,

11:19.780 --> 11:21.913
Is supposed to be 18 or 19,

11:21.915 --> 11:24.683
That high voice wouldn't fly.

11:24.685 --> 11:25.350
>> yeah.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.986
>> so hence why elijah won't

11:27.988 --> 11:30.221
Audio chat or video chat.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.289
>> sure.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.092
Elijah could be a girl.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.695
Let's now go to

11:36.697 --> 11:38.797
Elijah's profile.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.265
>> hair is a very important part

11:40.267 --> 11:41.132
Of this episode.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.634
I'm just gonna say it right now.

11:42.636 --> 11:43.301
>> here we go.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.870
Elijah's photos.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.605
A lot of photos.

11:47.607 --> 11:48.740
>> it is worth noting that

11:48.742 --> 11:49.874
None of these pictures have

11:49.876 --> 11:51.376
Anyone else in them.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.977
>> where are all of his friends?

11:52.979 --> 11:53.845
>> there's another facebook

11:53.847 --> 11:55.547
Page for him.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.082
>> both: Prok elijah.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.917
>> and there's elijah_prok.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.485
Elijah [bleep] prok.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.352
Why are there so many

12:01.354 --> 12:02.787
Elijah prok's?

12:02.789 --> 12:05.590
Go to mr. Def d.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.591
>> "I am elijah.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.759
I sing and scream.

12:07.761 --> 12:08.760
I skateboard."

12:08.762 --> 12:09.427
>> oh, look, he wrote

12:09.429 --> 12:10.428
Something in spanish.

You're all updated.

39:32.804 --> 39:37.474
>> it sounds like he supports

39:37.476 --> 39:38.742
The decisions that she makes,

39:38.744 --> 39:39.809
Which is what you need to, you

39:39.811 --> 39:40.510
Know, in a relationship.

39:40.512 --> 39:41.478
You want to be supportive.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.412
But, like, I hope that it works

39:42.414 --> 39:43.580
Out, like, really well for them,

39:43.582 --> 39:44.247
You know?

39:44.249 --> 39:45.248
I hope it's a positive thing.

39:45.250 --> 39:45.915
>> that's nice.

39:45.917 --> 39:46.649
I hope it all does work out

39:46.651 --> 39:47.684
For the best.

39:47.686 --> 39:48.451
Good to talk to you.

39:48.453 --> 39:49.619
Have a great summer.

39:51.022 --> 39:51.855

39:51.857 --> 39:53.923

39:58.630 --> 39:59.996
>> wow, look at the new hairdo.

39:59.998 --> 40:00.864
>> it's purple.

40:00.866 --> 40:01.731
It's pretty fun.

40:01.733 --> 40:02.732
[chuckles]

40:02.734 --> 40:03.600
>> wait, can you hold up your

40:03.602 --> 40:04.768
Hand again?

40:04.770 --> 40:05.902
>> yeah.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.270
>> what is that?

40:07.272 --> 40:08.671
>> it's a wedding ring.

40:08.673 --> 40:09.939
>> what?

40:09.941 --> 40:11.074
>> I'll try to get it close.

40:11.076 --> 40:11.741
>> what?

40:11.743 --> 40:12.976
>> you got married?

40:12.978 --> 40:13.643
>> yes.

40:13.645 --> 40:14.511
Me and danny went to the

40:14.513 --> 40:15.979
Courthouse and got married.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.480
>> oh, my god.

40:17.482 --> 40:18.848
He put a ring on it.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.083
Is he there?

40:20.085 --> 40:20.850
>> what's up, guys?

40:20.852 --> 40:21.518
>> yo!

40:21.520 --> 40:22.185
>> hey.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.119
>> danny, what did you think

40:23.121 --> 40:24.220
Of her tattoo when she

40:24.222 --> 40:25.388
Came home?

40:25.390 --> 40:26.122
>> it's good artwork.

40:26.124 --> 40:26.790
I liked it.

40:26.792 --> 40:27.457
Now, they have, like,

40:27.459 --> 40:29.192
A little tight bond.

40:29.194 --> 40:30.527
>> does that bother you?

40:30.529 --> 40:31.461
>> no.

40:31.463 --> 40:32.562
>> well, you guys seem

40:32.564 --> 40:33.396
Pretty happy.

40:33.398 --> 40:34.364
>> it's been good.

40:34.366 --> 40:35.265
We've had a lot of fun.

40:35.267 --> 40:35.932
>> congrats.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.033
I mean, just enjoy

40:37.035 --> 40:38.001
The honeymoon.

40:38.003 --> 40:38.768
>> we are enjoying it,

40:38.770 --> 40:39.636
Definitely.

40:39.638 --> 40:40.370
>> see you later, solana.

40:40.372 --> 40:43.106
>> bye.

40:43.108 --> 40:46.142
>> I've been in love with two

40:46.144 --> 40:48.278
Guys, but it's the same guy.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.012
>> were you thinking about

40:49.014 --> 40:49.979
Marrying this guy?

40:49.981 --> 40:51.514
>> yeah, and I don't know

40:51.516 --> 40:52.348
Who it is.

40:52.350 --> 40:53.716
>> he is confined to a state or

40:53.718 --> 40:55.685
Federal penitentiary.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.187
We're close, so he's definitely

40:57.189 --> 40:58.922
Feeling the heat.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.590
Let's do this.

41:00.592 --> 41:01.257
Did you see that?

41:01.259 --> 41:03.326
>> whoa.
