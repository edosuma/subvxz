00:17.017 --> 00:19.186
We're on in two minutes!

00:19.353 --> 00:22.939
I was busy preparing
your schedule for tomorrow.

00:23.106 --> 00:28.820
Lunch with the manager, flowers
for your sister-in-law in the hospital.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.740
Oh, yes. Maris' facelift.

00:32.698 --> 00:36.328
- I didn't know she needed one.
- She doesn't.

00:36.536 --> 00:40.916
All she needs is a little sun,
some exercise and a personality.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.588
- What are those?
- Copies of your schedule.

00:46.796 --> 00:51.051
Why are you running to the Xerox room
for copies of my schedule?

00:51.217 --> 00:54.846
- Is it because of that new intern?
- Eli.

00:55.972 --> 00:59.059
- He's probably all of 19!
- That's legal.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.729
Well, koo koo ka choo,
Mrs Robinson.

01:03.730 --> 01:09.152
He's so gorgeous you just want to bite
him all over. Haven't you seen him?

01:09.319 --> 01:14.699
No. I've been eating out lately.
You're not serious about dating him?

01:14.824 --> 01:20.246
Why can older men date younger
women, but not the other way round?

01:20.413 --> 01:24.042
I don't make the rules. I just enjoy them.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.252
You're on.

01:28.755 --> 01:32.550
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.554
I'll be with you for three hours.
Roz, who's our first caller?

01:36.763 --> 01:39.766
Linda, calling from a car phone.

01:39.932 --> 01:42.685
Hello, Linda. I'm listening.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.897
(Linda) 'My husband and l
are in the middle of a fight.

01:46.105 --> 01:49.025
'We're on our way to the Antique Mart.

01:49.192 --> 01:53.404
'We're lost, but he won't stop
and ask for directions.'

01:53.613 --> 01:58.200
Yes, this is a common source
of friction among couples.

01:58.367 --> 02:03.581
Some men need to be in control.
They see asking for help as weakness.

02:03.789 --> 02:06.709
'Everybody knows that.
I called to ask

02:06.876 --> 02:11.380
'how we get to the Antique Mart
from Cherokee and 14th Street.'

02:11.547 --> 02:15.217
(Husband) 'I don't need directions!
I know where I am!'

02:15.384 --> 02:19.138
(Linda) 'We're lost,
Walter. Face it, we're lost.'

02:19.305 --> 02:22.558
This isn't normally
the kind of advice I give,

02:22.725 --> 02:26.520
but let me see.
I've lived in Seattle most of my life.

02:26.729 --> 02:30.983
- I have a map right here.
- No, thanks, I don't need any help.

02:34.153 --> 02:39.575
Eddie, that's disgusting!
Why do animals drag things in?

02:39.783 --> 02:43.704
- What is it? A rat?
- No. A stupid doll.

02:43.871 --> 02:46.373
He carries it everywhere.

02:46.582 --> 02:48.542
(Doorbell)

02:48.751 --> 02:51.795
He never did this
before you had him fixed.

02:52.921 --> 02:55.591
- Hello.
- Not at the hospital?

02:55.758 --> 03:01.013
I'm on my way now. Poor Maris.
She has no hospital experience.

03:01.180 --> 03:05.851
Except the usual childhood things:
tonsils, adenoids, force-feeding.

03:08.854 --> 03:13.150
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing. Cosmetic surgery.

03:13.358 --> 03:18.071
Her chin, her lips,
her cheeks, her eyelids...

03:18.280 --> 03:22.034
You'd be faster telling us
what she's leaving alone.

03:23.368 --> 03:28.373
- In my opinion, this is just vanity.
- It's not vanity, it's insecurity.

03:28.540 --> 03:33.336
Women fall victim to our culture's
worship at the altar of beauty.

03:33.545 --> 03:38.300
Women over 40 feel unattractive
if they don't have perfect hair,

03:38.467 --> 03:42.512
porcelain skin, limpid eyes,

03:42.721 --> 03:48.226
pouting lips,
the voluptuous contours of a goddess.

03:49.394 --> 03:52.230
(Sighs wistfully)

03:55.233 --> 03:59.195
(Silence continues)

03:59.404 --> 04:03.241
I'm sorry.
I've forgotten what my point was.

04:03.408 --> 04:08.204
I know just what you mean.
I fell victim to that pressure myself.

04:08.413 --> 04:10.707
- I had a mole removed.
- Where?

04:10.915 --> 04:14.085
Just south of Manchester.

04:15.420 --> 04:18.464
- I meant where on your body?
- So did I.

04:24.178 --> 04:27.056
So, what time
is the surgery tomorrow?

04:27.223 --> 04:30.101
First thing in the morning.

04:30.268 --> 04:35.606
I was wondering if I might have your
moral support down at the hospital.

04:35.773 --> 04:40.778
- Sure. No problem.
- Thank you. Well, I'd better be off.

04:40.945 --> 04:45.700
Hey, Niles. It's not my business,
but how much is this setting you back?

04:45.867 --> 04:49.620
In the neighbourhood of $25,000.

04:49.787 --> 04:53.958
For an extra five grand, you can
get a new wife from the Philippines.

05:05.970 --> 05:08.556
- Ah, Dr Crane.
- Dr Sternstein.

05:08.723 --> 05:13.269
Excuse me... Your wife is recovering,
but it went splendidly.

05:13.477 --> 05:16.147
- You can see her in a few minutes.
- Thank you.

05:16.313 --> 05:19.150
All right, Mrs Patterson.

05:21.235 --> 05:26.282
He's an incredible plastic surgeon.
Did you see that woman?

05:26.490 --> 05:30.536
- Mr Patterson is a lucky man.
- Maybe that was Mr Patterson.

05:35.249 --> 05:40.713
Guess whose room I passed by on
the way down the hall: Artie Walsh.

05:42.423 --> 05:46.176
- Dad's old partner?
- Yes, he was in for tests last week.

05:46.343 --> 05:48.637
The results weren't very good.

05:48.846 --> 05:51.890
- Oh, no! I always liked him.
- Yeah.

05:52.099 --> 05:56.270
I remember him inviting us
for weenie roasts when we were kids.

05:56.437 --> 06:01.066
I'm sure he remembers you, too -
asking for a salade niÃ§oise.

06:05.863 --> 06:08.532
- Does Dad know he's here?
- I doubt it.

06:08.699 --> 06:12.369
- Think he wants to?
- No. They haven't spoken in years.

06:12.536 --> 06:15.163
Did Artie say why they had a fight?

06:15.372 --> 06:17.416
No, he's tight lipped.

06:17.624 --> 06:21.753
But, with some arm-twisting,
he admitted it was Dad's fault.

06:22.796 --> 06:25.215
You should try the cafeteria here.

06:25.382 --> 06:28.301
They've got a new chef.
He's from Yemen.

06:29.302 --> 06:32.264
So many of the great ones are!

06:33.223 --> 06:37.769
Dad, Artie Walsh is in hospital here.
He's not at all well.

06:37.978 --> 06:42.190
I know. They may have to scoop out
half his intestines.

06:42.399 --> 06:46.278
Taste this meat loaf.
It's just chewy enough.

06:46.486 --> 06:49.155
No, thank you.
Are you going to see him?

06:49.322 --> 06:53.827
- Can't think of any good reason to.
- He was your best friend.

06:53.994 --> 06:56.621
He never came when I took that bullet

06:56.830 --> 07:01.209
and was lying with tubes and drains
from every bodily opening.

07:01.418 --> 07:03.920
At least taste this gravy.

07:04.754 --> 07:08.091
Dad, we're talking about
a few minutes out of your life

07:08.258 --> 07:11.636
to have a little chat with a very sick man.

07:11.845 --> 07:14.764
Now, come on! You'll be glad you did.

07:14.931 --> 07:18.476
That sanctimonious tone
may wow them on the radio,

07:18.685 --> 07:21.020
but it doesn't cut ice with me.

07:21.187 --> 07:25.400
When I say "no", I mean it.
I'm not chatting with Artie Walsh.

07:27.110 --> 07:30.321
- Artie thought as much.
- What did he say?

07:30.530 --> 07:34.993
That you wouldn't have the guts
to see him. Then he sniggered.

07:35.201 --> 07:39.580
I've got news for him!
I've got twice the guts he has!

07:39.789 --> 07:44.127
And after his surgery tomorrow,
I'll have four times the guts!

07:48.631 --> 07:50.925
Artie, it's me again.

07:52.552 --> 07:55.388
- Martin?
- Artie.

07:56.639 --> 08:01.018
Dad insisted on rushing over
to see you, didn't you?

08:01.227 --> 08:03.229
Yeah, well...

08:05.982 --> 08:09.110
They said you were
in pretty rocky shape.

08:09.318 --> 08:12.113
They've been saying a lot of things.

08:17.159 --> 08:21.789
- Well, Marty, how's it been going?
- OK.

08:21.997 --> 08:24.583
Good. Small steps.

08:26.001 --> 08:29.672
- Sorry you're laid up.
- Thanks.

08:29.839 --> 08:32.133
It's nice of you to come by.

08:32.341 --> 08:35.260
- Somebody had to be the big man.
- Yeah.

08:36.345 --> 08:38.514
What's that supposed to mean?

08:38.681 --> 08:41.933
- I think you know.
- Why don't you tell me?

08:42.101 --> 08:44.562
I'm being bigger than you were.

08:44.770 --> 08:48.232
- With that lousy bullet in your hip?
- It hurt.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.484
Not enough!

08:50.693 --> 08:55.614
- A bullet might have improved you.
- Be glad it wasn't the butt.

08:55.781 --> 09:00.452
- It could have caused brain damage.
- You always want the last word.

09:00.619 --> 09:05.332
- I don't want any words with you.
- Too bad! I've got some choice ones.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.130
Next time, we'll stay longer.

09:22.391 --> 09:27.437
Stop staring at me like that!
I didn't touch your damned doll.

09:32.818 --> 09:36.822
Look, even if I did,
I did it for your own good.

09:36.988 --> 09:41.284
You were the joke of the park.
Even the poodles were laughing.

09:45.622 --> 09:48.250
Oh, all right.

09:48.458 --> 09:50.252
Here.

09:53.672 --> 09:56.591
Got to get that dog a GI Joe.

09:59.469 --> 10:01.554
Yes, Maris, I'm sure.

10:01.721 --> 10:05.475
No, you can't gain weight
from a glucose IV.

10:09.270 --> 10:12.816
No, there's no such thing
as a NutraSweet drip.

10:18.029 --> 10:21.574
Just close your eyes and go to sleep.

10:21.783 --> 10:24.077
Good night, Puppy Toes.

10:24.285 --> 10:26.371
Is everything OK?

10:26.579 --> 10:29.791
No.
She can't get on with her nurses.

10:29.958 --> 10:34.128
How can a reputable hospital
hire such troublemakers?

10:34.337 --> 10:39.509
Yes, the Little Sisters of Mercy
have always had that reputation.

10:43.638 --> 10:46.307
Dad, how was your reunion with Artie?

10:46.474 --> 10:48.685
Lousy.

10:48.893 --> 10:52.814
What started this bad blood
between the two of you?

10:52.980 --> 10:55.733
He spread a rumour about me at work.

10:56.901 --> 11:00.113
- About what?
- None of your business.

11:00.321 --> 11:03.825
I don't want to talk about it.
Subject closed.

11:08.079 --> 11:10.122
Must have been pretty bad.

11:10.331 --> 11:15.336
- Must have been on the take.
- More likely drugs.

11:15.503 --> 11:19.632
- Drugs, yes. Or sex.
- Or all three.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.052
All right,
it was worse than any of that.

11:23.844 --> 11:25.971
He told people...

11:26.180 --> 11:28.599
I cried at "Brian's Song".

11:34.021 --> 11:37.233
Dear God.
You think that's the kind of thing

11:37.441 --> 11:40.569
that happens
to other people's fathers.

11:40.778 --> 11:44.949
I wasn't crying!
Me and Artie were watching the movie

11:45.115 --> 11:47.826
and I got some pretzel salt in my eye.

11:49.036 --> 11:53.999
Artie told everybody.
I became the joke of the department.

11:54.208 --> 11:59.296
Other cops left Kleenex on my desk.
They called me Boo-hoo Crane.

12:00.631 --> 12:03.884
I can understand
your being upset with him,

12:04.051 --> 12:07.304
but what's he so cheesed off
with you for?

12:09.390 --> 12:11.433
Well, I...

12:11.642 --> 12:16.104
I guess I let something slip
about the size of his wife's behind.

12:16.980 --> 12:21.276
- I beg your pardon?
- She's got this gigantic rear end.

12:21.485 --> 12:24.863
Looks like she's shoplifting pillows.

12:31.912 --> 12:35.123
You felt compelled
to share that with him?

12:35.332 --> 12:39.961
For 20 years, I tried not to,
then, one day, I let my guard down.

12:40.170 --> 12:44.216
We were coming into work,
and he says, "How's the wife?"

12:44.424 --> 12:49.763
And I said, "At least she doesn't
have an arse the size of Albuquerque."

12:52.265 --> 12:57.646
A 20-year relationship ruined
because of a little name-calling?

12:57.854 --> 13:00.190
No, there's more to it than that.

13:00.357 --> 13:03.443
Artie always had to have the last word.

13:05.278 --> 13:07.739
He couldn't leave well alone.

13:08.615 --> 13:11.493
Couldn't let sleeping dogs lie.

13:14.454 --> 13:18.291
You'd think it was all over,
then he'd start again.

13:19.292 --> 13:21.294
Can we drop this?

13:21.461 --> 13:26.508
I've got better things to do than
sit in a hospital room taking abuse.

13:26.716 --> 13:29.385
Oh, God, I'm due back with Maris.

13:31.805 --> 13:36.935
- I'll be sleeping at the hospital tonight.
- Why?

13:37.143 --> 13:42.148
Maris' doctor feels it soothes the
patient to copy the home environment.

13:42.315 --> 13:46.945
So I slipped a gun under her pillow
and got a room across the hall.

13:55.828 --> 13:59.207
We'd better say a prayer
for the night nurse.

13:59.415 --> 14:05.421
It's a shame your father and his
friend can't let bygones be bygones.

14:05.588 --> 14:10.843
- I don't know what else to do.
- Maybe if I had a go at it.

14:11.010 --> 14:14.263
I've come to have
a pretty good understanding

14:14.430 --> 14:18.226
of how the Crane mind works.
When it works.

14:19.936 --> 14:23.898
- About your partner...
- I don't want to talk about it.

14:24.106 --> 14:27.693
No, I just wanted to tell you
I'm on your side.

14:27.860 --> 14:32.198
- I say good riddance to bad rubbish.
- Damn right.

14:32.365 --> 14:34.950
You can't have had any good times.

14:35.117 --> 14:39.121
There weren't many.
Occasionally, we'd go fishing.

14:39.288 --> 14:42.666
- That's not much fun.
- Not the way I did it.

14:42.875 --> 14:45.461
But Artie decided he'd teach me.

14:45.628 --> 14:49.048
He even bought this beat-up old boat.

14:49.215 --> 14:52.760
He said after we retired,
we'd get more use out of it.

14:52.968 --> 14:56.305
It seems pushy
to foist his interests on you.

14:56.472 --> 15:00.559
Oh, it wasn't so bad.
I remember once I bust my hump

15:00.726 --> 15:04.063
reeling in what turned out
to be an old slipper.

15:04.229 --> 15:09.318
You know what Artie did? Unhooked it
and threw it on the barbecue.

15:10.319 --> 15:13.781
Maybe he wasn't
such a bad guy after all.

15:16.492 --> 15:22.539
Maybe you're right. I listen to myself talk
and I sound like a big fool.

15:23.665 --> 15:28.128
- Thanks, Daphne. You opened my eyes.
- I thought I might.

15:28.337 --> 15:32.799
I'm going to go to that hospital,
buy him a big stuffed animal,

15:33.008 --> 15:36.261
throw my arms around him
and never let him go.

15:40.265 --> 15:44.144
You really are a hateful old sod,
aren't you?

15:44.353 --> 15:47.022
Come on, Eddie! Time for your walk.

15:49.274 --> 15:51.693
Hello? Yes, it is.

15:53.695 --> 15:55.822
Oh, I see.

15:56.031 --> 15:59.618
I guess it isn't really a shock,
considering.

16:00.535 --> 16:04.080
Yes. I'm sure they did
everything they could.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.292
Thank you.

16:08.877 --> 16:12.589
- Who was that?
- We can talk about it later, Dad.

16:15.216 --> 16:18.094
- Is everything OK?
- Why do you ask?

16:19.387 --> 16:25.018
I hear you say "I'm sorry" and such
like. It's natural to be concerned.

16:25.226 --> 16:27.395
- You thought it was about Artie.
- No!

16:27.562 --> 16:30.315
- Yes, you did.
- So what if I did?

16:30.482 --> 16:33.318
It proves you still care about him.

16:33.485 --> 16:38.990
All right, suppose I do feel bad about
this fight. What the hell can I do?

16:39.157 --> 16:43.995
That's up to you.
I could drive you to the hospital.

16:46.247 --> 16:49.042
I don't need you. I can drive myself.

16:49.250 --> 16:53.504
You can't. That was your mechanic.
Your transmission's dead.

17:05.767 --> 17:08.435
(TV gunfight)

17:11.521 --> 17:15.151
- Artie...
- Oh, Jeez!

17:15.358 --> 17:20.114
- You guys got off on the wrong foot.
- All right. I'll handle this.

17:22.782 --> 17:24.868
Artie...

17:27.371 --> 17:31.208
- Will you turn the TV off?
- I'll turn it down.

17:34.712 --> 17:40.134
Listen, Artie, I'm sorry about some
of those things I said earlier, OK?

17:41.218 --> 17:43.054
Maybe all of them.

17:43.220 --> 17:47.266
I was steamed that you never came
to see me in hospital.

17:47.475 --> 17:51.520
I didn't come by because
I didn't think you'd want see me.

17:51.687 --> 17:53.731
Of course I wanted to!

17:54.815 --> 17:59.111
- That's what my wife said.
- Oh, yeah. Loretta.

18:10.164 --> 18:12.207
It's nice of you to come.

18:12.416 --> 18:15.586
It's not easy for someone
as stubborn as you.

18:15.753 --> 18:20.716
Me stubborn? I'm not the one
who always has to have the last...

18:23.093 --> 18:26.597
No, you're right, Artie. I am stubborn.

18:27.764 --> 18:30.392
- And it wasn't easy.
- Thanks, Martin.

18:31.518 --> 18:34.104
We have a few things to talk about,

18:34.271 --> 18:38.275
so if you'll just wait outside,
it'll be a lot easier.

18:38.442 --> 18:40.903
Anything I said would be irrelevant.

18:41.111 --> 18:47.034
As a therapist, you learn once things
are working, anything else would be...

18:52.622 --> 18:56.084
What's an old cop like you
doing in a joint like this?

18:56.293 --> 18:59.796
Believe me,
I didn't expect to end like this.

19:00.005 --> 19:03.842
End? You'll be out raising hell
before you know it.

19:04.050 --> 19:08.889
I don't know. The doctors
aren't tossing their hats in the air.

19:09.055 --> 19:12.434
My sons are doctors.
They don't know nothing.

19:12.642 --> 19:15.729
You've got to get out of here.

19:15.896 --> 19:19.065
We've got a lot of lost time
to make up for.

19:19.232 --> 19:23.653
- You still got that stupid boat?
- Yeah. I hung on to it.

19:23.862 --> 19:27.032
We'll sink that damn thing yet.

19:27.240 --> 19:31.453
Hey, Artie, remember the time
you barbecued the slipper?

19:31.661 --> 19:35.832
Stuff always tastes better
when you catch it yourself.

19:41.838 --> 19:47.093
- What are you doing here?
- I got Artie and Dad talking again.

19:47.260 --> 19:51.723
I had to resort to some cheap,
manipulative pseudo-psychology.

19:51.931 --> 19:54.809
Always go to your strengths.

19:57.520 --> 20:01.983
Looks like you've bought out
the entire gift shop for Maris.

20:02.150 --> 20:05.528
This isn't for Maris. It's for her nurses.

20:07.030 --> 20:12.452
They're meeting to discuss her
and I gather hospital strikes are ugly.

20:14.454 --> 20:18.791
- Visiting hours are over.
- Thank you. I'll go round up Dad.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.880
Excuse me. Do you work on
my wife's floor, Mrs Maris Crane?

20:25.131 --> 20:27.383
Yes, I do.

20:27.592 --> 20:30.636
I'd like you to have these chocolates.

20:31.554 --> 20:35.808
- I'm on the night shift.
- And this lovely watch.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.028
Dad, it's time to go.

20:47.236 --> 20:51.907
What? You get another phone call
about your dad's transmission?

20:52.074 --> 20:55.661
- Your dad told me about that.
- All I was doing was...

20:55.870 --> 20:58.581
I know what you were doing.
Thanks, kid.

20:59.999 --> 21:02.042
- See you soon.
- Sure.

21:03.502 --> 21:05.504
OK, we've got a deal.

21:05.671 --> 21:09.675
When you get out of this joint,
you give me fishing lessons.

21:09.842 --> 21:12.219
- lf I get out.
- When you get out.

21:12.428 --> 21:15.681
You can't have the last word
on this one.

21:17.641 --> 21:19.852
- See you, Marty.
- See you, Art.

21:20.019 --> 21:21.603
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:21.812 --> 21:23.605
Take care.

21:25.858 --> 21:27.693
Take care.

21:27.860 --> 21:29.987
Stay loose!

21:35.951 --> 21:37.953
See you, Artie!

21:59.391 --> 22:01.435
(Artie) See you, Marty.

22:12.779 --> 22:18.451
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:18.618 --> 22:20.036
# Oh, my!

22:20.245 --> 22:27.168
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:27.377 --> 22:32.924
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.091 --> 22:35.635
# They're calling again #

22:35.844 --> 22:38.555
Good night!
