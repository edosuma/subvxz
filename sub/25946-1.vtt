01:00.606 --> 01:02.129
Be careful, your fingers.

01:22.149 --> 01:23.672
May I help you?

01:23.759 --> 01:27.981
This is the Calthorpe.
Private hotel.

01:28.068 --> 01:30.244
I'm Mrs. Eleanor Young.

01:30.331 --> 01:33.813
I have a reservation
at the Lancaster Suite.

01:33.900 --> 01:37.425
We spoke on the phone
when I confirmed yesterday.

01:37.512 --> 01:40.820
Sorry, don't seem to have
your reservation.

01:42.343 --> 01:43.866
Good evening.

01:43.953 --> 01:45.694
I'm Reginald Ormsby,

01:45.781 --> 01:48.001
hotel manager.
Is there a problem?

01:48.088 --> 01:49.959
I'm Mrs. Eleanor Young.

01:50.046 --> 01:53.398
My family and I would like
to be shown to our suite.

01:53.485 --> 01:55.356
We've had a long flight.

01:55.443 --> 01:59.055
We're fully booked, madam.
You must have made a mistake.

01:59.142 --> 02:00.753
I'm sure
you and your lovely family

02:00.840 --> 02:03.059
can find other accommodation.

02:03.146 --> 02:06.454
May I suggest
you explore Chinatown?

02:13.200 --> 02:16.116
Please, may I use
your phone to call my husband?

02:16.203 --> 02:18.336
It's the least you can do.

02:18.945 --> 02:20.294
Mmm.

02:27.649 --> 02:29.869
Mrs. Young,
I must ask you to leave

02:29.956 --> 02:31.131
or I'll have to call
the police.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.046
Please, go right ahead.

02:35.962 --> 02:38.965
Lord Calthorpe, my apologies
for the disturbance.

02:39.052 --> 02:43.926
Eleanor! I just got off
the phone with your husband.

02:44.013 --> 02:46.364
Get the Lancaster Suite ready.
Now.

02:47.756 --> 02:49.497
Surely you're joking, sir.

02:49.584 --> 02:51.717
I assure you, I'm not.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.414
As of this evening,

02:53.501 --> 02:55.808
my family's long history

02:55.895 --> 03:00.160
as custodians
of the Calthorpe is ended.

03:00.247 --> 03:03.293
I'm selling the hotel
to my dear friends,

03:03.381 --> 03:05.644
the Young family of Singapore.

03:07.036 --> 03:09.778
Meet the new lady
of the house,

03:09.865 --> 03:11.301
Eleanor Young.

03:13.086 --> 03:14.435
Join me for a toast.

03:14.522 --> 03:16.089
We'd be delighted.

03:20.354 --> 03:23.096
Do get a mop. The floor's wet.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.278
Get a mop.

04:03.441 --> 04:05.486
I'm all in.

04:14.103 --> 04:16.236
Fold.

04:16.322 --> 04:17.803
Oh...

04:17.890 --> 04:19.021
Nothing?

04:20.545 --> 04:22.329
This whole time
you had nothing?

04:23.286 --> 04:24.853
All right, so

04:24.940 --> 04:28.901
how did I beat T.A. Curtis
so very, very badly?

04:28.988 --> 04:32.121
Well, I know for a fact
that Curtis is cheap.

04:33.688 --> 04:36.561
So he's not playing
using logic or math,

04:36.648 --> 04:38.345
but using his psychology.

04:38.432 --> 04:41.043
Our brains so hate the idea

04:41.130 --> 04:42.741
of losing something
that's valuable to us

04:42.828 --> 04:44.351
that we abandon
all rational thought,

04:44.438 --> 04:46.048
and we make some really
poor decisions.

04:46.135 --> 04:47.963
So, Curtis wasn't playing
to win.

04:48.050 --> 04:50.009
He was playing not to lose.

04:50.096 --> 04:52.881
Here.
Put it towards a haircut.

04:54.230 --> 04:56.145
All right,
that's it for today.

04:56.232 --> 04:58.583
Don't forget your essays
on conditional probability

04:58.670 --> 05:00.715
are due next week.

05:10.508 --> 05:12.292
Yes! Mmm-hmm.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.468
You know what?
You can order your own.

05:14.555 --> 05:16.601
Mmm. I'm okay with coffee.
Thanks.

05:16.688 --> 05:18.428
Yeah, well,
you always say that,

05:18.516 --> 05:20.300
and then you end up eating
all my dessert.

05:20.387 --> 05:21.606
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:21.693 --> 05:23.782
'Cause I have, like,
a tiny bit.

05:23.869 --> 05:25.087
Uh-huh. Okay.
Can we have one more

05:25.174 --> 05:26.524
of these, please? Thank you.

05:28.134 --> 05:31.137
So what about us
taking an adventure east?

05:34.836 --> 05:37.404
You wanna get pork buns
in the East Village.

05:37.491 --> 05:38.623
That's what it is, isn't it?

05:40.363 --> 05:43.715
I was actually thinking
of further east.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.152
Like Queens?

05:46.239 --> 05:48.807
Like Singapore.
For spring break.

05:48.894 --> 05:50.417
Colin's wedding.

05:50.504 --> 05:52.158
We've been dating
for over a year now,

05:52.245 --> 05:53.420
and I think it's about time

05:53.507 --> 05:55.161
people met
my beautiful girlfriend.

05:55.248 --> 05:57.772
Come on, I'm Colin's best man.

05:57.859 --> 05:59.557
Don't you wanna see
where I grew up?

05:59.644 --> 06:02.168
Meet my family, my Ah Ma?

06:02.255 --> 06:04.562
And meet up with that strange
college roommate of yours.

06:04.649 --> 06:06.041
Peik Lin.

06:06.128 --> 06:07.477
- Mmm-hmm. Peik Lin.
- She has been begging me

06:07.565 --> 06:08.957
to come visit her, you know.

06:09.044 --> 06:11.743
The universe has spoken.
It wants you over there.

06:13.092 --> 06:14.833
Come to Singapore.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.792
I want the whole island to
meet the brilliant Rachel Chu.

06:18.532 --> 06:19.620
Aww.

07:36.131 --> 07:38.090
"If then you have
been raised with Christ,

07:39.352 --> 07:40.875
"Seek the things
that are above

07:40.962 --> 07:43.051
"where Christ is seated

07:43.138 --> 07:46.228
"at the right hand of God.

07:46.315 --> 07:49.188
"Set your minds
on things that are above,

07:49.275 --> 07:52.191
"not on things
that are on Earth."

07:52.278 --> 07:54.149
Eleanor,
is Nicki bringing a girl

07:54.236 --> 07:55.803
to Colin's wedding?

07:55.890 --> 07:58.153
My Amanda heard it
from her friend Francesca.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.852
Eddie says
her name is Rachel Chu.

08:00.939 --> 08:03.419
Oh, I thought that
Nick was coming alone.

08:03.506 --> 08:05.683
Did you know
he had a girlfriend?

08:05.770 --> 08:09.295
Nick dates many girls.
It's hard to keep track.

08:09.382 --> 08:10.905
Amanda knows everyone

08:10.992 --> 08:12.994
and she has never heard
of her.

08:13.081 --> 08:14.735
Rachel Chu.

08:14.822 --> 08:17.956
Maybe she's from the Taiwan
plastics Chu family.

08:18.043 --> 08:20.741
If you want,
I have a private investigator.

08:20.828 --> 08:22.308
Very discreet.

08:22.395 --> 08:25.137
I think we should return
to the word of God.

08:26.573 --> 08:27.661
Alix.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.926
Ephesians.
Chapter six, verse four.

08:32.013 --> 08:34.320
"Bring up your children
in the discipline

08:34.407 --> 08:35.842
"and instruction of the Lord."

08:35.929 --> 08:37.409
Oh, I do hope
she's a good Christian girl.

08:37.496 --> 08:38.498
Well,
if he's bringing her home,

08:38.585 --> 08:39.847
it must be serious.

08:39.933 --> 08:40.934
Exactly.

08:45.723 --> 08:47.376
Oh.

08:47.463 --> 08:49.509
- It's my mum. Do you mind?
- Mmm. Go ahead.

08:49.596 --> 08:50.771
All right.

08:50.858 --> 08:52.251
- Save me some of that.
- Okay.

08:54.296 --> 08:56.429
Hey, Mum,
everything okay?

08:56.516 --> 08:59.171
Does something have
to be wrong for me to call?

08:59.258 --> 09:01.521
Yeah, usually.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.610
Very funny.

09:03.697 --> 09:05.264
Are you bringing
the girl you're seeing

09:05.351 --> 09:07.222
to Colin's wedding?

09:07.309 --> 09:10.356
Mmm. We were literally
just talking about that.

09:10.443 --> 09:12.010
How could you know?

09:12.097 --> 09:13.751
Everybody knows.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.715
Radio One Asia.

09:21.802 --> 09:24.413
Move on to Corinthians.
I'll catch up.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.980
Oh, yes.

09:26.067 --> 09:28.374
We're looking forward
to having you home.

09:28.461 --> 09:31.681
And your room
is all ready for you.

09:31.769 --> 09:33.466
Thanks, Mum.

09:33.553 --> 09:35.729
But Rachel and I will be
staying together.

09:35.816 --> 09:37.165
I see.

09:37.252 --> 09:39.472
Well, I'm having
the house re-done.

09:39.559 --> 09:41.387
And it's not ready for guests.

09:41.474 --> 09:43.693
If Rachel comes, I think
she might be more comfortable

09:43.781 --> 09:45.608
staying somewhere else.

09:47.872 --> 09:49.438
All right, sorry about that.

09:49.525 --> 09:50.962
I saved you a piece.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.312
You did, did you?
A very small piece at that.

09:53.399 --> 09:55.227
Thank you very much.

09:55.314 --> 09:58.099
How's your mom?
Everything okay?

09:58.186 --> 10:00.972
Couldn't be better.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.017
Hey, Mom, this one's kind of
cute. What do you think?

10:03.104 --> 10:06.716
No, no! You can't wear that
to meet Nick's Ah Ma.

10:06.804 --> 10:09.328
Blue and white
is for Chinese funerals.

10:09.415 --> 10:14.072
Now this, this symbolizes
good fortune and fertility.

10:14.159 --> 10:17.727
Great! I was really going for
that "lucky baby maker" vibe.

10:17.815 --> 10:19.599
Hey! You're the one
who asked for my help

10:19.686 --> 10:21.340
picking out a dress
to meet Nick's family.

10:21.427 --> 10:23.777
It's only 'cause I hardly know
anything about them.

10:23.864 --> 10:25.866
Every time I bring them up,
Nick changes the subject.

10:25.953 --> 10:27.737
Maybe he's embarrassed.

10:27.825 --> 10:30.001
Maybe his parents are poor,
and he has to send them money.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.133
That's what
all good Chinese children do.

10:32.220 --> 10:33.831
Oh, you're going to have

10:33.918 --> 10:35.528
a wonderful time.

10:35.615 --> 10:37.704
You've always wanted
to go to Asia.

10:37.791 --> 10:40.576
And who knows, if all
goes well in Singapore,

10:40.663 --> 10:42.578
you might just come back
with a souvenir.

10:42.665 --> 10:44.798
Oh, Mom, stop!

10:44.885 --> 10:46.495
Nick and I haven't
even talked about that.

10:48.933 --> 10:51.587
I mean, his parents
can't not like me, right?

10:53.981 --> 10:55.809
What was that look?
I saw that.

10:55.896 --> 10:58.029
Nothing. It's just,

10:58.116 --> 10:59.987
Nick bringing a girl
all the way there

11:00.074 --> 11:01.684
to meet them can mean a lot

11:01.771 --> 11:03.904
to these overseas families.
They're different from us.

11:03.991 --> 11:07.647
How are they different?
They're Chinese, I'm Chinese.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.041
I'm so Chinese,
I'm an economics professor

11:10.128 --> 11:12.173
with lactose intolerance.

11:12.260 --> 11:14.088
Yeah, but you grew up here.

11:21.966 --> 11:23.271
You're different.

11:24.577 --> 11:25.970
But wearing a lucky color

11:26.057 --> 11:29.060
will make
a good first impression.

11:34.674 --> 11:36.328
Okay, game plan.

11:36.415 --> 11:38.373
Check our bags,
get through security,

11:38.460 --> 11:40.288
and then we could eat
one of the three homemade

11:40.375 --> 11:42.551
Tupperware meals
my mom packed for us.

11:42.638 --> 11:44.423
Good afternoon, Mr. Young,
Miss Chu.

11:44.510 --> 11:46.294
We'll take your bags and get
you checked into first class.

11:46.381 --> 11:48.383
- Great.
- Oh. No, there's a mistake.

11:48.470 --> 11:51.169
We're not first class.
We're economy people.

11:51.256 --> 11:52.387
This way, please.

11:52.474 --> 11:54.607
Just go with it. Come on.

11:54.694 --> 11:56.217
But...

11:56.304 --> 11:58.219
Yeah, they'll be fine.
Just leave them there.

12:02.310 --> 12:04.225
Welcome aboard,
Mr. Young, Miss Chu.

12:04.312 --> 12:06.053
Here's the way
to your private suite.

12:07.446 --> 12:09.317
And some champagne.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.147
Thank you.

12:16.672 --> 12:19.197
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

12:19.284 --> 12:21.764
After takeoff, would you like
to enjoy the lounge chairs,

12:21.851 --> 12:23.462
or should we convert
your suite into a bedroom?

12:23.549 --> 12:26.204
Uh... We're good. Thank you.

12:26.291 --> 12:27.292
Enjoy.

12:29.337 --> 12:31.426
- Nick. We can't afford this.
- Mmm.

12:34.386 --> 12:37.998
These pajamas are fancier
than any of my real clothes.

12:38.085 --> 12:39.652
My family has business
with the airline.

12:39.739 --> 12:42.133
The tickets, they're a perk.

12:45.223 --> 12:46.920
What kind of business?

12:47.007 --> 12:49.531
Real estate, investment,
other things.

12:49.618 --> 12:50.793
Nothing interesting.

12:50.880 --> 12:51.881
"Dim sum."

12:54.928 --> 12:58.888
So your family is, like, rich?

12:58.976 --> 13:01.021
We're comfortable.

13:01.108 --> 13:04.329
That is exactly what
a super-rich person would say.

13:06.809 --> 13:08.768
It's not a big deal,
obviously.

13:08.855 --> 13:12.990
I just think it's kind of
weird that I had no idea.

13:13.077 --> 13:15.035
I mean,
you have a Jamba Juice card.

13:15.122 --> 13:17.255
You use my Netflix password.

13:17.342 --> 13:19.779
You play basketball at that Y
that kind of smells.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.868
I really like that place,
thank you very much.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.306
And yes, my family has money,

13:25.393 --> 13:27.134
but I've always
thought of it as theirs.

13:27.221 --> 13:28.614
Not mine.

13:28.701 --> 13:30.268
I get that.
But I'm going all the way

13:30.355 --> 13:32.139
over there to meet them...

13:32.226 --> 13:34.446
Kind of just wanna know
what I'm getting into.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.970
And, you know,
they're your family.

13:37.057 --> 13:38.667
Well...

13:40.669 --> 13:42.280
My family is much like
anybody else's.

13:42.367 --> 13:43.890
Mmm-hmm.

13:43.977 --> 13:45.805
There's half of them
that you love and respect,

13:45.892 --> 13:47.981
and then
there's the other half.

13:48.068 --> 13:49.417
Which half am I meeting?

13:52.942 --> 13:54.379
Well,
there's my cousin Alistair,

13:54.466 --> 13:56.250
based in Taiwan,
works in movies.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.993
And cut!

14:00.080 --> 14:03.779
He's dating Kitty Pong,
an actress.

14:03.866 --> 14:04.911
- Kitty.
- Alistair.

14:06.782 --> 14:10.003
You like it?
I was feeling very,

14:10.090 --> 14:13.441
very the emotions.
Can you feel it?

14:13.528 --> 14:16.575
Oh, I can feel all of you.
And all of me.

14:30.023 --> 14:31.329
Okay, and what
about your cousin Eddie?

14:31.416 --> 14:32.852
You don't ever talk about him.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.246
Well, Eddie's a big
finance guy in Hong Kong.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.464
A real family man.

14:40.294 --> 14:41.382
You know,
if you move,

14:41.469 --> 14:42.862
it will look more natural.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.386
No, this way you get
our optimal angles.

14:45.473 --> 14:47.388
Then we're done.

14:49.042 --> 14:50.652
Russell, thank you so much.

14:50.739 --> 14:52.350
It's an honor
to be photographed by you.

14:52.437 --> 14:54.047
My pleasure.
People will love it

14:54.134 --> 14:55.831
in the next Hong Kong Vogue.

14:55.918 --> 14:58.530
Thank you, Russell.

14:58.617 --> 15:01.576
Hong Kong Vogue? I knew it.
Your dress is a disaster.

15:01.663 --> 15:03.274
If you wore a Bottega gown,
like I told you to,

15:03.361 --> 15:04.623
we'd be in the American Vogue.

15:04.710 --> 15:06.668
You can wear
that gown to Hell, Eddie.

15:06.755 --> 15:08.583
Stop!

15:08.670 --> 15:09.845
Then there's Astrid.

15:09.932 --> 15:11.934
Ah. I remember Astrid.

15:12.021 --> 15:13.806
She's like who I wanna be
when I grow up.

15:13.893 --> 15:15.677
Astrid is awesome.

15:15.764 --> 15:16.765
And she's probably
the only one

15:16.852 --> 15:18.158
I'm actually close with.

15:18.245 --> 15:19.681
And she's really grounded
and down to earth,

15:19.768 --> 15:21.248
once you get to know her.

15:28.603 --> 15:31.302
Not only did she graduate
top of her class at Oxford,

15:31.389 --> 15:34.566
start multiple charities,
and is a fashion icon,

15:34.653 --> 15:37.699
Astrid has the biggest heart
of any of my cousins.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.181
Mummy? See what I made
for bunny?

15:41.268 --> 15:42.313
No, not now.

15:48.101 --> 15:51.713
Hi, I'm Astrid.
What's your name?

15:51.800 --> 15:52.932
Vita.

15:53.019 --> 15:54.412
And who's this?

15:54.977 --> 15:56.631
Bun-Bun.

15:56.718 --> 16:00.157
Well, I think Bun-Bun looks
very dashing with his bow.

16:00.244 --> 16:01.462
You have a good eye.

16:01.549 --> 16:02.855
Thank you.

16:02.942 --> 16:05.118
Miss Leong, right this way.

16:05.205 --> 16:06.511
It's very nice
to meet you both.

16:16.651 --> 16:19.132
These are all
brand-new from Antwerp.

16:19.219 --> 16:22.048
You're the first person
I've shown them to.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.532
What are those?

16:29.403 --> 16:30.883
Those?

16:33.277 --> 16:35.757
Those are very special.

16:35.844 --> 16:38.151
Burmese pearl drop earrings.

16:38.238 --> 16:42.764
Set with emeralds, and rare
pigeon blood-red rubies.

16:42.851 --> 16:45.506
They were worn
by Queen Supayalat

16:45.593 --> 16:49.206
at her self-anointed
coronation in 1878.

16:50.207 --> 16:52.905
How much?

16:52.992 --> 16:55.647
Having you wear
one of my pieces

16:55.734 --> 16:58.780
is better publicity
than I can buy.

16:58.867 --> 17:03.002
I'll let them go at cost.
1.2 million.

17:07.354 --> 17:09.356
So if you have
all this family there,

17:09.443 --> 17:11.531
why are we staying in a hotel?

17:11.618 --> 17:13.534
Aren't good Chinese sons

17:13.621 --> 17:16.363
supposed to stay
with their parents?

17:16.450 --> 17:21.063
Well, because A,
I'm not that good a son.

17:22.717 --> 17:23.675
And B,

17:26.590 --> 17:29.202
I just want you to myself,
just for a bit.

17:29.898 --> 17:30.986
That okay?

17:33.772 --> 17:35.295
Okay.

18:11.940 --> 18:15.335
God, I can't believe this
airport has a butterfly garden

18:15.422 --> 18:17.555
and a movie theater.

18:17.642 --> 18:20.732
JFK is just salmonella
and despair.

18:20.819 --> 18:23.169
Nick! Nick!

18:30.524 --> 18:31.656
Araminta!

18:34.267 --> 18:35.877
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

18:35.964 --> 18:37.226
- Rachel.
- Hi.

18:37.314 --> 18:38.532
There he is.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.142
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

18:40.229 --> 18:41.970
It's so nice to meet you, too.

18:42.057 --> 18:44.233
- Nicki-Nick!
- It's been too long, brother.

18:44.321 --> 18:46.758
It has been too long.
Welcome back.

18:46.845 --> 18:47.976
You guys didn't have to
pick us up.

18:48.063 --> 18:49.761
Of course we did. We had to.

18:49.848 --> 18:52.067
Of course I had to come
welcome my best man properly.

18:52.154 --> 18:53.504
- Hi, Rachel.
- Hello.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.027
Oh! Lovely to finally
meet you.

18:55.114 --> 18:56.333
Nice to meet you, too.

18:56.420 --> 18:57.290
Shall we?
Let me help you with this.

18:57.377 --> 18:58.639
Yes.

18:58.726 --> 19:00.206
- These are for you.
- I can grab these.

19:00.293 --> 19:01.555
I know
they're a bit over-the-top.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.209
Let's get
you guys localized.

19:03.296 --> 19:04.428
- Are you hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

19:04.515 --> 19:07.561
So let's eat
everything we can.

19:24.186 --> 19:28.190
Welcome to
heaven on earth!

19:28.277 --> 19:30.802
I hope you're hungry.
I am bloody starving.

19:37.939 --> 19:40.768
Guys! Here! Whoo!

19:40.855 --> 19:43.249
Come with me.

19:43.336 --> 19:44.337
Each of these
hawker stalls

19:44.424 --> 19:45.860
sells pretty much one dish,

19:45.947 --> 19:48.254
and they've been perfecting it
for generations.

19:48.341 --> 19:50.343
You know, this is one of
the only places in the world

19:50.430 --> 19:53.390
where street food vendors
actually earn Michelin stars.

19:53.477 --> 19:55.174
- Hey! How are you?
- Uncle.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.958
Long time no see, my friend.

19:57.045 --> 19:59.744
Here you go.
Thank you very much, sir.

19:59.831 --> 20:02.442
- Look at this. Look at this.
- My favorite.

20:06.054 --> 20:07.142
Hmm.

20:12.452 --> 20:13.540
One of those for you.

20:13.627 --> 20:14.628
Yes, thank you.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.809
Looks a little vomity.

20:28.816 --> 20:30.557
- Oh, my God!
- Yes?

20:30.644 --> 20:32.733
I told you. Best satay
on the island for sure.

20:32.820 --> 20:34.039
So yummy, isn't it?

20:34.126 --> 20:35.997
All right, dig in, guys. Oh.

20:36.084 --> 20:37.912
Before I forget,
I need your help tomorrow.

20:37.999 --> 20:39.479
I need to do
some groomsmen stuff,

20:39.566 --> 20:41.481
and I don't wanna do it alone
with Bernard Tai.

20:41.568 --> 20:42.700
I still cannot believe
that you got

20:42.787 --> 20:44.353
that guy to be your groomsman.

20:44.441 --> 20:45.616
Thank you. Thank you.
I rest my case.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.313
Minty...

20:47.400 --> 20:50.316
Well, it wasn't up to me,
was it? It's not my choice.

20:50.403 --> 20:52.274
Bernard is
the human douche nozzle

20:52.361 --> 20:54.929
who used to steal my tuck shop
money when we were kids.

20:55.016 --> 20:56.757
Until Nicki-Nick beat him up.

20:56.844 --> 20:58.498
- Well...
- You beat somebody up?

20:58.585 --> 21:00.021
I threw a single punch.

21:00.108 --> 21:02.459
I fell on the floor
and the guy sat on me.

21:02.546 --> 21:05.331
So, wasn't really
much of a fight.

21:05.418 --> 21:07.246
A toast, guys.

21:07.333 --> 21:11.337
To my best man, Nick Young,
who can't fight for nuts,

21:11.424 --> 21:13.818
but will always
have your back.

21:13.905 --> 21:17.125
- A toast to married life.
- To...

21:17.212 --> 21:19.084
- Not yet! Too early.
- Oh, God!

21:19.171 --> 21:20.738
Well, this time
next week, guys!

21:22.653 --> 21:24.263
We gotta get over your
bachelor party first, matey.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.308
Is that necessary, man?
Come on!

21:26.395 --> 21:29.398
Listen, Rachel,
I know we've only just met,

21:29.486 --> 21:31.444
but it's my bachelorette party
this weekend,

21:31.531 --> 21:32.924
and I would love
for you to come.

21:34.534 --> 21:35.883
That'll be amazing.

21:35.970 --> 21:37.929
- Thank you so much!
- Good! Good!

21:38.016 --> 21:39.408
- Am I out of the picture?
- Thanks, man.

21:39.496 --> 21:40.758
Am I totally
out of the picture?

21:40.845 --> 21:41.759
Yes, I've replaced you
with Bernard.

21:41.846 --> 21:43.282
Screw that man!

21:43.369 --> 21:46.111
Also, I have to say,

21:46.198 --> 21:49.636
I can't remember the last time
I saw Nick like this.

21:49.723 --> 21:50.985
That's funny, though.

21:52.683 --> 21:54.554
He's just happy to be home.

21:54.641 --> 21:56.730
Oh, yeah,
he's just happy to be home.

21:57.688 --> 21:59.951
With you.

22:00.038 --> 22:01.735
Your dad
will be the death of you.

22:01.822 --> 22:02.954
My dad
will be the death of me.

22:03.041 --> 22:04.129
Oh, cheers to that.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.134
Guys, we have to dig in

22:09.221 --> 22:10.831
'cause this crab
is not gonna eat itself.

22:10.918 --> 22:12.572
What should I try first?

22:12.659 --> 22:13.791
- Try some of this. Thank you.
- Do you want some of this?

22:15.357 --> 22:17.011
- It's really spicy.
- It is really spicy.

22:55.659 --> 22:57.095
Whoo!

22:57.182 --> 23:00.402
Nick's in Singapore!

23:00.489 --> 23:01.795
It's good to be home.

23:10.412 --> 23:11.892
- Is Michael here?
- Not yet, ma'am.

23:11.979 --> 23:14.199
Also, your son woke up.
He wants to see you.

23:14.286 --> 23:15.809
All right.

23:15.896 --> 23:18.595
You know what to do. Quickly.

24:11.648 --> 24:14.128
I'm sorry.
Got stuck in a meeting.

24:14.215 --> 24:15.347
It's okay. I get it.

24:15.434 --> 24:16.870
But don't forget,

24:16.957 --> 24:17.871
wedding festivities
start on Wednesday,

24:17.958 --> 24:19.264
so no emergencies next week.

24:19.351 --> 24:20.657
I know.

24:20.744 --> 24:22.397
Wouldn't dream
of missing a second

24:22.484 --> 24:24.095
with your family
and their friends.

24:24.182 --> 24:25.836
Come on, it won't be all bad.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.446
Nick and his new girlfriend
will be there.

24:27.533 --> 24:28.708
You'll like her.

24:28.795 --> 24:30.275
Oh, yeah?

24:30.362 --> 24:33.800
Why? 'Cause she's a commoner
like me?

24:33.887 --> 24:35.454
You know
that's not what I meant.

24:35.976 --> 24:37.935
Ooh.

24:38.022 --> 24:41.068
You know, I thought
I caught the maids

24:41.155 --> 24:45.333
trying to shove a pair
of Jimmy Choos behind a dryer.

24:45.420 --> 24:47.640
Yeah, I don't know
why you bother

24:47.727 --> 24:49.729
trying to hide
your shopping from me.

24:49.816 --> 24:51.078
You can buy whatever you want.

24:51.165 --> 24:54.778
I get it.
Besides, everybody knows

24:54.865 --> 24:56.780
you wear the money pants
in this family.

24:56.867 --> 24:59.347
Pants are overrated.

25:01.262 --> 25:03.395
Oh, I got you something, too.

25:08.052 --> 25:11.098
To celebrate
the launch of your startup.

25:11.185 --> 25:13.144
I know you don't like
expensive gifts,

25:13.231 --> 25:15.276
but you're not a captain
in the army anymore.

25:15.363 --> 25:18.410
You're a CEO.
You should look the part.

25:23.937 --> 25:25.504
I...

25:28.115 --> 25:31.466
I love it. Thank you.

26:01.845 --> 26:04.238
What time is it?

26:04.325 --> 26:06.153
Morning.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.721
I'm afraid it's time for me
to do some groomsman duties.

26:08.808 --> 26:12.159
Stay in bed.

26:12.246 --> 26:14.771
You stay here.
I'll get you a breakfast tray.

26:22.779 --> 26:24.955
You know what?
I should get up, too.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.305
I told Peik Lin I would
meet up with her today.

26:27.392 --> 26:29.046
Ah, a little college reunion.

26:29.133 --> 26:30.787
But don't forget.
Dinner at Ah Ma'stonight.

26:30.874 --> 26:32.179
The whole family's
gonna be there.

26:32.266 --> 26:34.138
- Yes.
- I can't wait to show you off.

26:36.531 --> 26:39.099
Hubba, hubba.

26:39.883 --> 26:41.014
How can I resist?

26:41.101 --> 26:42.624
Ooga-ooga.

26:42.711 --> 26:44.801
You put those glasses on
on purpose.

27:10.391 --> 27:12.785
New York in the house!

27:12.872 --> 27:14.352
Yeah! Yeah!

27:15.135 --> 27:16.484
Peik Lin!

27:16.571 --> 27:20.227
What up, bitch? Yeah!

27:20.314 --> 27:22.229
Oh, my God! You look amazing.

27:22.316 --> 27:24.449
I know. Some things
never change, right?

27:24.536 --> 27:27.321
And this is quite a place.

27:27.408 --> 27:30.934
Astor!
Vanderbilt! Rockefeller!

27:31.021 --> 27:34.024
Naughty, naughty boys.
Stop barking.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.504
- Hey, Rachel!
- Hi!

27:36.591 --> 27:40.247
Singapore is so hot. Come in
and enjoy the aircon. Come on.

27:40.334 --> 27:43.468
Whole family waiting to
meet you. Very excited.

27:43.555 --> 27:46.819
Rachel, welcome, welcome.

27:46.906 --> 27:48.734
Wow! Oh, my gosh!

27:48.821 --> 27:51.476
Your house is amazing,
Mrs. Goh.

27:54.914 --> 27:57.961
Call me Auntie. Auntie Neenah.

27:58.048 --> 27:59.484
Sorry. Auntie Neenah.

27:59.571 --> 28:01.007
Oh, yeah.

28:04.924 --> 28:06.839
We were inspired by

28:06.926 --> 28:10.147
the Hall of Mirrors
in Versailles.

28:10.234 --> 28:12.149
And Donald Trump's bathroom.

28:12.236 --> 28:14.238
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:14.325 --> 28:15.674
You like it or not?

28:15.761 --> 28:20.809
Oh, yes.
The gold is very brilliant.

28:24.161 --> 28:28.078
Rachel Chu, we are so grateful

28:28.165 --> 28:30.689
for all the help
you have given

28:30.776 --> 28:34.562
my Peik Lin
back in her uni days.

28:34.649 --> 28:37.609
I mean, without you,
she would be a hot mess.

28:37.696 --> 28:39.959
Oh, my God, no.
Actually,

28:40.046 --> 28:41.613
if it wasn't for her,
I'd be a big mess.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.223
She was a huge help
to me in college.

28:44.529 --> 28:46.096
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Goh.

28:46.183 --> 28:49.969
Nice to meet you, too, Chu.

28:50.056 --> 28:55.627
Ku-ku. Ku-Chu. You. Poo-poo.

28:55.714 --> 28:57.063
No, I'm just kidding.

28:57.150 --> 28:58.630
I don't have an accent.

28:58.717 --> 28:59.979
I'm just messing with you.

29:00.066 --> 29:01.763
No, I studied
in the States, too.

29:01.850 --> 29:03.548
Yeah, Cal State Fullerton.

29:03.635 --> 29:05.550
- I majored in Thought.
- Mmm.

29:05.637 --> 29:07.769
Don't stand
on ceremony, Rachel.

29:07.856 --> 29:09.554
This is simple food, lah.

29:09.641 --> 29:12.513
Ah, cha, cha, cha!
Don't be shy.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.341
- Oh. Thank you.
- You're not a model.

29:14.428 --> 29:15.821
I'm definitely not.

29:15.908 --> 29:18.171
No, you're not.
Not at all. Far from it.

29:18.258 --> 29:19.390
I know.

29:19.477 --> 29:21.087
Make sure you eat it all.

29:21.174 --> 29:22.915
'Cause I'm watching you.

29:23.002 --> 29:24.961
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay, yeah.

29:25.048 --> 29:27.528
- Ah Pa, can we go trampoline?
- ...go trampoline?

29:27.615 --> 29:29.878
You haven't finished
your nuggets yet, sweetie.

29:29.966 --> 29:31.010
Okay, there's
a lot of children

29:31.097 --> 29:33.143
starving in America, right?

29:33.230 --> 29:35.841
I mean, take a look at her.
She's American, huh?

29:35.928 --> 29:37.495
Really skinny.
You wanna look like that?

29:37.582 --> 29:38.713
No.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.932
Then eat your nuggets!

29:41.499 --> 29:44.110
So, Rachel,
what you do in America?

29:44.197 --> 29:45.459
Um...

29:45.546 --> 29:48.941
- I'm an economics professor.
- Wow.

29:49.028 --> 29:53.206
Very impressive.
Econ professor, eh?

29:53.293 --> 29:56.688
Wow, you must be very smart.
Good for you.

29:56.775 --> 29:58.037
Let me get this straight.

29:58.124 --> 29:59.865
You both went
to the same school,

29:59.952 --> 30:02.737
yet someone came back
with a degree that's useful.

30:02.824 --> 30:05.653
And the other one came back
as Asian Ellen.

30:10.745 --> 30:12.182
Psst, P.T.

30:12.269 --> 30:13.792
Hmm?

30:13.879 --> 30:15.315
Look over here.

30:15.402 --> 30:16.751
She's a hottie.

30:16.838 --> 30:19.232
This is the kind of girl
you should date.

30:19.319 --> 30:23.323
Smart, beautiful.
Not those like K-Pop skanks

30:23.410 --> 30:27.153
with no brain,
big eyes and small backsides.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.286
She has an amazing backside.

30:29.373 --> 30:31.679
This is Goh standard.

30:31.766 --> 30:33.855
Don't be shy.
Just talk to her.

30:33.942 --> 30:35.031
I love you.

30:35.118 --> 30:36.945
Okay. No, just, uh...

30:37.033 --> 30:38.469
Pa, she's here
with her boyfriend.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.559
I don't see no ring
on her finger.

30:41.646 --> 30:43.126
Well,
my boyfriend's actually

30:43.213 --> 30:44.692
from Singapore
and that's why we're here.

30:44.779 --> 30:46.738
We're here to go
to his best friend's wedding,

30:46.825 --> 30:48.740
where he's gonna be
the best man.

30:48.827 --> 30:50.568
- Hmm.
- What's his name?

30:50.655 --> 30:53.658
This is a very small island.
Maybe we know his family.

30:53.745 --> 30:55.007
His name is Nick Young.

31:03.537 --> 31:04.886
Uh...

31:04.973 --> 31:06.410
The Nick you're dating
is Nick Young?

31:08.542 --> 31:10.544
His best friend...

31:10.631 --> 31:13.156
You're invited
to Colin Khoo's wedding, ah?

31:13.243 --> 31:15.854
Yeah. You guys
know them or something?

31:15.941 --> 31:17.421
Hells yeah.

31:17.508 --> 31:19.031
The Khoos, the Youngs...

31:19.118 --> 31:21.251
I mean, who doesn't know
who they are?

31:21.338 --> 31:23.035
They're just
the biggest developers...

31:23.122 --> 31:25.081
...in all of Singapore.

31:25.168 --> 31:28.519
And Malaysia, Thailand,
Brunei, New Mexico.

31:28.606 --> 31:29.781
She gets it.

31:29.868 --> 31:31.391
Colin and Araminta's wedding

31:31.478 --> 31:33.524
is Singapore's
event of the century.

31:33.611 --> 31:35.830
The Youngs are like royalty.

31:35.917 --> 31:37.571
Did you not know?
Does she not know?

31:37.658 --> 31:39.747
Why you never
say before?

31:39.834 --> 31:42.663
Tell, tell,
what are they like?

31:42.750 --> 31:45.362
I don't really know
what they're...

31:45.449 --> 31:47.451
I haven't met them yet.
I'm gonna meet them tonight.

31:47.538 --> 31:48.626
I'm going to
Nick's grandma's house.

31:50.497 --> 31:52.325
You're going to Nick's
grandma's house wearing this?

31:52.412 --> 31:53.674
Wearing that?

31:59.158 --> 32:00.681
No way. No way.

32:00.768 --> 32:02.466
Yeah, I thought
red was a lucky color, right?

32:02.553 --> 32:06.774
Yeah. If you're an envelope.
Zing! Nailed it!

32:06.861 --> 32:09.299
Zing!

32:09.386 --> 32:11.649
Rachel, these people
aren't just rich, okay?

32:11.736 --> 32:14.086
They're crazy rich. Look.

32:14.173 --> 32:15.566
There's new money
all over Asia.

32:15.653 --> 32:16.741
We got
the Beijing billionaires,

32:16.828 --> 32:18.351
the Taiwan tycoons...

32:18.438 --> 32:20.614
But the Young family,
they're old-money rich.

32:20.701 --> 32:23.878
They had money when
they left China in the 1800s.

32:23.965 --> 32:26.794
And they went
all the way down here.

32:26.881 --> 32:29.667
Not there... Here.

32:29.754 --> 32:31.364
They came to Singapore

32:31.451 --> 32:32.800
when there was nothing
but jungle and pig farmers.

32:32.887 --> 32:34.541
There was a snake here,
eating an apple.

32:34.628 --> 32:36.935
You know what I mean?
And they built all of this.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.676
Now, they're the landlords

32:38.763 --> 32:40.373
of the most expensive city
in the world. Here you go.

32:40.460 --> 32:44.508
These people are so posh
and snobby, they're snoshy.

32:44.595 --> 32:45.900
Here you go.

32:45.987 --> 32:47.685
Yeah,
but Nick's not like that.

32:47.772 --> 32:49.382
Even if he isn't,
I guarantee you the family is.

32:49.469 --> 32:50.731
Which is why tonight,

32:50.818 --> 32:51.732
you need to not look
like Sebastian

32:51.819 --> 32:52.907
of The Little Mermaid.

32:52.994 --> 32:54.344
You know, the little crab guy?

32:58.913 --> 33:00.306
Look at this guy,
he's sleeping.

33:00.393 --> 33:01.916
Come on,

33:02.003 --> 33:03.483
this isn't
your grandma's road.

33:03.570 --> 33:05.137
God damn it!

33:05.224 --> 33:06.704
Thank you for driving me.

33:06.791 --> 33:08.532
Duh. This is like
my one chance to see

33:08.619 --> 33:10.490
- the Young family mansion.
- Mmm.

33:17.671 --> 33:18.759
At the next intersection,

33:18.846 --> 33:20.065
make a U-turn.

33:20.935 --> 33:22.415
Make a U-turn.

33:22.502 --> 33:24.112
Are you sure
you gave me the right address?

33:24.200 --> 33:25.679
The GPS says there's, like,
nothing here.

33:25.766 --> 33:27.246
Like, literally nothing.

33:32.208 --> 33:33.905
I don't know
why we're here.

33:33.992 --> 33:36.603
I mean,
I put in the exact address.

33:36.690 --> 33:38.953
- You copied and you pasted it?
- Yeah.

33:39.040 --> 33:40.259
Did you just
copy and paste "jungle"

33:40.346 --> 33:42.087
and just kind of
threw it in there?

33:42.174 --> 33:43.349
- No. This is the address...
- Because I feel like that's...

33:43.436 --> 33:45.699
You actually used the...
Okay! All right.

33:45.786 --> 33:48.224
That's a...
Uh, hi! So we'll just...

33:50.008 --> 33:52.053
Hello, sir. How are you?

33:52.140 --> 33:53.838
We're here for the party,
and we're...

33:53.925 --> 33:55.970
We come in peace.

33:56.057 --> 33:58.669
Do you know where
the Young family house is?

33:58.756 --> 34:00.758
Nicholas Young?
I'm Rachel Chu.

34:00.845 --> 34:03.326
I'm here to go
to his family dinner.

34:03.413 --> 34:06.981
Uh, Rachel Chu for the list.
If there is a list.

34:07.068 --> 34:08.940
He's on the phone.
He's on the phone.

34:09.027 --> 34:11.116
Is that a gun knife?
It's a knife gun.

34:11.203 --> 34:14.815
Okay, and there's a friend.
Hi! Very nice to...

34:16.730 --> 34:19.429
We can go through?
We're going through? Okay.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.474
- Don't stab the car.
- Okay.

34:24.042 --> 34:28.264
Okay, okay. Thank you, bye!

34:50.373 --> 34:53.376
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

34:53.463 --> 34:56.987
Beautiful? It's 200 mil
worth of real estate.

34:57.074 --> 34:59.120
It's spectacular.

35:26.931 --> 35:31.065
Damn, Rachel.
He's like the Asian Bachelor.

35:31.152 --> 35:32.328
Thanks, brother.

35:37.420 --> 35:38.899
Hello, gorgeous.

35:46.037 --> 35:48.605
Wow! I think I've just fallen
in love with you

35:48.692 --> 35:50.607
all over again.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.528
Rachel!

35:58.615 --> 35:59.703
I missed you, too.

35:59.790 --> 36:01.487
- Yeah?
- What did you get up to?

36:01.574 --> 36:03.620
Psst! Rachel!

36:03.707 --> 36:06.579
Oh, uh, this is my friend,
Peik Lin.

36:06.666 --> 36:08.059
- Hi, there.
- Howdy.

36:08.146 --> 36:09.060
Thank you very much
for bringing Rachel.

36:09.147 --> 36:10.409
Oh, no worries.

36:10.496 --> 36:12.106
Do you wanna stop by
for some dinner?

36:12.193 --> 36:13.717
- Oh, no, I couldn't impose.
- No, it's not a problem.

36:13.804 --> 36:14.935
- I had some dinner plans.
- Seriously, we've got...

36:15.022 --> 36:16.241
Yeah, I'll fucking come
to dinner.

36:20.593 --> 36:21.986
- I missed you.
- Did you?

36:22.073 --> 36:23.596
- Yes.
- How was your day?

36:23.683 --> 36:25.555
It was fun!
I got to meet

36:25.642 --> 36:27.600
Peik Lin's whole family,
her dog.

36:30.864 --> 36:31.822
Nope.

36:34.781 --> 36:36.348
You have a cocktail dress
in your trunk?

36:36.435 --> 36:37.915
I'm not an animal, Rachel.

36:43.007 --> 36:45.923
I thought
this was just a family thing.

36:46.010 --> 36:48.839
My grandmother's invited some
of her friends over tonight.

36:48.926 --> 36:51.842
Her tan huasare blooming.
It's a whole thing.

36:51.929 --> 36:53.278
You ready for this?

36:56.977 --> 37:00.328
Oh, damn, Nick.
It's a party though. Okay.

37:12.384 --> 37:13.733
The good bathrooms
are up the stairs,

37:13.820 --> 37:15.343
and you can
get changed in there.

37:15.431 --> 37:17.694
Okay, good, I'll find it.
Thank you.

37:29.575 --> 37:30.968
You know,
when you said you grew up

37:31.055 --> 37:32.709
in your grandma's house,

37:32.796 --> 37:35.799
I wasn't expecting this.

37:35.886 --> 37:37.453
Thank you.

37:37.540 --> 37:41.152
Oh, no, no.
Those are for your fingers.

37:41.239 --> 37:42.588
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

37:42.675 --> 37:44.590
A little bit much, I know.

37:44.677 --> 37:46.462
I mean,
this place is gorgeous.

37:46.549 --> 37:48.202
And like
the rolling green hills.

37:48.289 --> 37:51.510
I mean, there are
armed guards out there.

37:51.597 --> 37:52.990
And a giant tiger.

37:53.077 --> 37:54.731
Okay.

37:55.775 --> 37:58.517
That is Mr. Harimau.

37:58.604 --> 38:00.693
Now, my great-grandfather
actually shot him

38:00.780 --> 38:02.521
when he ran into the house.

38:02.608 --> 38:06.307
But Astrid and I, we used to
hide cigarettes in his paws.

38:06.394 --> 38:07.831
Do you wanna head in?

38:07.918 --> 38:10.050
Actually, I wanted to
bring you over

38:10.137 --> 38:11.399
- to my mum first.
- Oh.

38:11.922 --> 38:13.314
Come on.

38:54.399 --> 38:55.487
Mum.

38:58.708 --> 39:01.058
You need a haircut.
So unkempt.

39:01.145 --> 39:03.103
And you look tired
from your trip.

39:03.190 --> 39:05.932
I'm gonna ask the cook
to make you some herbal soup.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.414
I'll send it
to the hotel later.

39:09.501 --> 39:12.286
Mum, this is Rachel Chu.

39:12.373 --> 39:15.812
Oh, my gosh! I'm so happy
to meet you, Mrs. Young.

39:15.899 --> 39:18.162
Or Auntie. Right?

39:18.249 --> 39:21.295
I'm learning
the lingo.

39:21.382 --> 39:23.602
I'm very glad
to finally meet you, too.

39:23.689 --> 39:25.952
And I'm sorry Nick's father
couldn't be here.

39:26.039 --> 39:28.041
He was called to business
in Shanghai.

39:28.128 --> 39:31.305
I told Rachel when duty calls,
Dad answers.

39:31.392 --> 39:32.698
As it should be.

39:32.785 --> 39:34.526
Nick tells me
you're a professor, too.

39:34.613 --> 39:36.006
What do you teach?

39:36.093 --> 39:37.703
Um, I teach economics.

39:37.790 --> 39:40.532
And she's brilliant.
NYU's youngest faculty member.

39:44.928 --> 39:46.277
So, economics...

39:46.364 --> 39:47.713
Sounds challenging.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.672
Are your parents
academics as well?

39:49.759 --> 39:53.197
No. Well, my dad actually died
before I was born,

39:53.284 --> 39:55.373
and my mom
didn't even go to college.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.157
She actually hardly spoke
any English

39:57.244 --> 39:59.464
when she immigrated
to the United States.

39:59.551 --> 40:01.901
But she worked really hard,
and she studied,

40:01.988 --> 40:03.816
and she earned
her real estate license

40:03.903 --> 40:06.123
while she was waiting tables
to support us.

40:06.210 --> 40:07.733
Now, she likes to say

40:07.820 --> 40:10.301
that she's Flushing's
top real estate broker.

40:10.388 --> 40:16.046
Self-made woman.
She must be so proud of you.

40:16.133 --> 40:18.265
Well, she knows that I'm
passionate about what I do,

40:18.352 --> 40:19.745
and she's always
wanted that for me.

40:21.486 --> 40:25.446
Pursuing one's passion.
How American.

40:25.533 --> 40:28.101
Well, your mother's
very open-minded,

40:28.188 --> 40:29.581
not like here,

40:29.668 --> 40:31.452
where parents are obsessed

40:31.539 --> 40:33.411
with shaping the life
of their children.

40:35.631 --> 40:36.675
That's dinner.

40:36.762 --> 40:37.937
Go ahead.

40:38.024 --> 40:39.373
I'll be out in a minute.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.767
Rachel, it was lovely
meeting you.

40:41.854 --> 40:45.118
Thank you. You, too.

40:45.205 --> 40:46.859
Okay, she hates me.

40:46.946 --> 40:48.731
She takes a little minute
to warm up,

40:48.818 --> 40:50.733
- but we'll get there.
- A minute?

41:04.224 --> 41:06.487
- Nicki! Rachel!
- Astrid.

41:07.488 --> 41:09.229
Hey. Good to see you.

41:09.316 --> 41:10.404
I'm so glad you could make it.

41:10.491 --> 41:12.015
- Michael.
- Nick.

41:12.102 --> 41:13.407
Astrid. So good
to see a face I know.

41:13.494 --> 41:14.931
This is my husband, Michael.

41:15.018 --> 41:17.194
Nice to meet you.
Heard so much about you.

41:17.281 --> 41:18.674
Nice to meet you, Michael.

41:18.761 --> 41:21.546
Hey, the golden boy's back!
Nick!

41:21.633 --> 41:23.896
And you must be Rachel.

41:23.983 --> 41:25.942
I'm Edison Cheng.
This is my wife.

41:26.029 --> 41:27.508
- Hi. I'm...
- Her name is Fiona.

41:27.595 --> 41:29.249
So I see you've already met
Princess Astrid

41:29.336 --> 41:31.774
and her little
soldier toy-boy, Mikey.

41:31.861 --> 41:33.776
You know, Mikey is a big-shot
tech startup guy.

41:33.863 --> 41:35.299
So if you forget
your password,

41:35.386 --> 41:36.996
he's your man.

41:37.083 --> 41:40.347
So you're from the Taiwan
plastic Chus, right?

41:40.434 --> 41:43.046
Can I punch him in the face?
Just once.

41:43.133 --> 41:44.395
Take a number.

41:44.482 --> 41:47.354
I'll be in my usual corner.
Champagne?

41:47.441 --> 41:48.878
Thank you.

41:53.404 --> 41:56.886
So, have you prepped Rachel
to face the wolves?

41:56.973 --> 41:58.757
Rachel is a New Yorker.

41:58.844 --> 42:01.455
She lectures millennials
for a living.

42:01.542 --> 42:03.544
I think she'll manage
our family.

42:03.631 --> 42:05.808
You've been away too long.

42:05.895 --> 42:07.418
Okay, sorry, time out.

42:07.505 --> 42:09.333
So you're not
from a Taiwan Chu family?

42:09.420 --> 42:10.769
Nope.

42:10.856 --> 42:12.205
Hong Kong telecom Chus?

42:12.292 --> 42:13.424
No.

42:13.511 --> 42:15.382
Malaysian packing peanut Chus?

42:15.469 --> 42:16.993
Is that really a thing?

42:17.080 --> 42:18.908
- Yeah, it's everywhere.
- I'm gonna stop you there

42:18.995 --> 42:20.518
because I'm gonna take her
on the rounds.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.520
- We'll be back, though.
- No, wait. Hang on.

42:22.607 --> 42:25.523
China instant noodle Chus.
Rachel,

42:25.610 --> 42:28.091
Chu are you?

42:29.353 --> 42:31.398
Ugh. Let's go.

42:34.662 --> 42:37.013
This is Auntie Alix
and Auntie Felicity.

42:37.100 --> 42:39.102
Hi!
It's so nice to meet you.

42:39.189 --> 42:41.931
I've never been
to a tan huaparty before.

42:42.018 --> 42:44.020
We love any excuse
to throw a soiree.

42:44.107 --> 42:46.152
Do your parents like
to entertain?

42:46.239 --> 42:48.938
Oh. I'm sorry.
Your mother's single.

42:49.677 --> 42:51.114
Yup.

42:51.201 --> 42:52.506
Auntie Jacqueline.

42:52.593 --> 42:54.030
One of my parents'
oldest friends.

42:54.117 --> 42:57.120
I actually met Nick's father
at Cambridge.

42:57.207 --> 43:00.036
So, what line of work
is your father in?

43:00.123 --> 43:02.299
Oh, my father died
before I was born.

43:02.386 --> 43:05.258
But he was a factory worker
in China.

43:20.534 --> 43:22.319
This is Ling Cheh,

43:22.406 --> 43:24.147
my old nanny.

43:28.542 --> 43:32.242
Look, now's the time
we need all hands on deck.

43:32.329 --> 43:34.461
Please, please,
just do me this favor.

43:34.548 --> 43:35.941
Thank you. Bye-bye.

43:37.595 --> 43:39.727
They started
clearing away dinner.

43:39.815 --> 43:41.338
Your favorites.

43:42.730 --> 43:44.558
Thank you.

43:46.996 --> 43:48.824
You know if you need
bodies at the office,

43:48.911 --> 43:50.303
I could always come in
and help out.

43:52.436 --> 43:54.481
The glamorous Astrid Leong

43:54.568 --> 43:58.137
- working as an assistant?
- Mmm-hmm.

43:58.224 --> 44:02.707
Wait, isn't Araminta's
bachelorette party tomorrow?

44:02.794 --> 44:06.102
And this will be the perfect
excuse to get out of it.

44:06.189 --> 44:08.582
Thank you. Really.

44:08.669 --> 44:10.410
But I've got
everything covered.

44:11.585 --> 44:12.848
Okay.

44:14.066 --> 44:15.589
I forgot to get you a fork.

44:15.676 --> 44:17.504
It's okay, you stay.
I'll go get it.

44:26.600 --> 44:29.299
Michael,
I think it's the office.

44:45.184 --> 44:48.187
Oh, my God! Nick, I can't
believe I just did that.

44:48.274 --> 44:49.972
It's fine. I don't think
anybody even noticed.

44:50.059 --> 44:51.538
I think I freaked out
your nanny...

44:51.625 --> 44:53.845
Oh, my God!

44:53.932 --> 44:55.281
So sorry.

44:55.368 --> 44:56.326
It's fine,
don't worry about it.

44:56.413 --> 44:57.849
Can I have a tissue please?

44:57.936 --> 45:00.373
Go, go. Get changed.
I'll keep Rachel company.

45:00.460 --> 45:02.375
Thank you, Oli.
You're in good hands.

45:02.462 --> 45:03.550
Give me two minutes.
I'll change.

45:03.637 --> 45:05.030
Sorry.

45:06.902 --> 45:08.120
Hi, I'm Rachel.

45:08.207 --> 45:09.643
Oh, I know.

45:09.730 --> 45:11.950
Rachel! Rachel!

45:12.037 --> 45:13.647
I heard you thought
Ah Mawas the cook!

45:15.127 --> 45:16.737
Ahh!

45:16.824 --> 45:19.392
On the bright side,
you're the talk of the party.

45:19.479 --> 45:20.828
People like your dress.

45:20.916 --> 45:21.960
Oh, I did that.

45:22.047 --> 45:23.222
- Oh.
- I know!

45:23.309 --> 45:25.094
Such a chic '70s goddess.

45:25.181 --> 45:26.660
I know.

45:26.747 --> 45:28.619
It's very disco Cleopatra,
but in a good way.

45:28.706 --> 45:30.012
That's exactly
what I was going for.

45:30.099 --> 45:32.840
Oh, well. Oliver.

45:32.928 --> 45:34.407
- Hi.
- I like your shoes.

45:34.494 --> 45:36.061
Oh, thank you.
I'm Peik Lin. Ditto.

45:36.148 --> 45:37.584
- Cheers.
- There you go.

45:37.671 --> 45:38.890
Gosh, these are lovely.

45:38.977 --> 45:39.978
They're clip-ons. Thank you.

45:40.065 --> 45:41.806
Are they? Oh, wow!

45:41.893 --> 45:43.808
So, Oliver,
are you a cousin, too?

45:43.895 --> 45:47.072
Mmm. Well, I'm one of
the poorer relations.

45:47.159 --> 45:48.595
The rainbow sheep
of the family.

45:49.857 --> 45:51.163
But I make myself useful.

45:51.250 --> 45:53.296
Whatever the Youngs want,
I procure.

45:53.383 --> 45:56.299
Golden koi fish,
Huanghuali furniture.

45:56.386 --> 45:57.996
A rare Cambodian gong.

45:58.083 --> 46:00.738
Why would they want to buy
a rare Cambodian gong?

46:03.871 --> 46:05.438
Because they can.

46:10.574 --> 46:13.011
Ah Mainsists
all your clothes be washed

46:13.098 --> 46:14.839
and pressed every two weeks.

46:17.059 --> 46:19.148
This one.

46:19.235 --> 46:22.020
Everything is exactly
as I left it.

46:30.463 --> 46:32.378
Looking for your cigars?

46:32.465 --> 46:34.859
I had them thrown out
years ago.

46:37.644 --> 46:39.255
Never could get
anything past you, could I?

46:41.170 --> 46:43.955
I keep telling Ah Ma
to put your things away,

46:44.042 --> 46:45.391
but she says this room

46:45.478 --> 46:47.219
makes her feel
like you're still here.

46:49.613 --> 46:51.615
Well, I got an earful

46:51.702 --> 46:54.096
when you didn't move back
last year.

46:55.619 --> 46:58.317
Your father and I were really

46:58.404 --> 47:00.058
looking forward
to having you home.

47:03.322 --> 47:05.020
He's not getting any younger.

47:05.890 --> 47:07.283
With you on board,

47:07.370 --> 47:09.372
maybe he'll take a day off
once in a while.

47:10.895 --> 47:12.810
I know, Mum.

47:12.897 --> 47:15.421
I'm just not ready yet.

47:15.508 --> 47:17.641
There's things in New York
that I wanna see through.

47:20.557 --> 47:24.126
Well, I'm happy
I finally met Rachel.

47:24.213 --> 47:26.432
She is very impressive.

47:26.519 --> 47:28.608
I think so, too.

47:28.695 --> 47:29.957
I thought
you might be excited

47:30.045 --> 47:32.264
that the first girl
that I bring home

47:32.351 --> 47:34.310
is a Chinese professor.

47:35.746 --> 47:38.053
Chinese American.

47:41.665 --> 47:45.190
You know, bringing her home,

47:45.277 --> 47:48.106
introducing her
at a large family gathering,

47:49.151 --> 47:50.848
some people may say...

47:50.935 --> 47:53.111
When there's something
to say

47:53.198 --> 47:56.506
about Rachel and me,
you'll be first to hear.

47:59.683 --> 48:04.992
But some things I need to
figure out on my own.

48:05.080 --> 48:07.865
Is that an American accent
I'm hearing?

48:09.736 --> 48:10.911
How do I look?

48:18.528 --> 48:19.790
Perfect.

48:33.543 --> 48:35.588
Everyone! Everyone!

48:35.675 --> 48:38.591
The tan huaplants
very rarely bloom,

48:38.678 --> 48:41.159
and even then only at night.

48:41.246 --> 48:45.598
Their beauty is spectacular
but fleeting.

48:45.685 --> 48:48.558
By dawn, they'll be gone.

48:48.645 --> 48:50.603
Come. Come.

48:59.438 --> 49:02.093
Oh, someone forgot
to wear a bra.

49:02.180 --> 49:06.967
Kitty Pong. Cousin Alistair's
latest flame. An actress.

49:07.054 --> 49:11.624
Rumor is, she was in a porno. Two Girls, One Cup of Noodles.

49:11.711 --> 49:14.236
You know, I thought I would
like that more than I did.

49:14.323 --> 49:16.020
- The book was much better.
- Mmm-hmm.

49:18.762 --> 49:22.809
Is it just me
or are people staring at me?

49:22.896 --> 49:26.726
Oh, they're just jealous.
You nabbed the crown prince.

49:26.813 --> 49:30.165
Nicki is Ah Ma'sfavorite,
in line to inherit everything.

49:30.252 --> 49:32.950
No surprise there
when that's the competition.

49:35.126 --> 49:36.954
Oh, speaking of
the grande dame...

49:59.019 --> 50:00.195
There you are.

50:00.282 --> 50:01.413
I've been looking
all over for you.

50:01.500 --> 50:03.763
You ready to meet
my grandmother?

50:06.201 --> 50:07.202
Ah Ma...

50:49.853 --> 50:52.159
Look,
they're in full bloom.

51:08.872 --> 51:11.614
It's so nice
having Nick back home.

51:11.701 --> 51:14.051
But he seems different.

51:16.401 --> 51:19.535
When children are away
from home too long,

51:19.622 --> 51:21.363
they forget who they are.

51:31.764 --> 51:33.940
What's up? Let's jam!

51:41.208 --> 51:45.517
Rachel!
So happy you're here. Oh!

51:45.604 --> 51:49.391
Oh, my God.
Your Gap look, brilliant.

51:49.478 --> 51:51.436
Thanks.

51:51.523 --> 51:53.656
- She's coming with me.
- Uh, hold on.

51:53.743 --> 51:55.658
Kiss. 36 hours. Bye.

51:55.745 --> 51:57.964
- Minty, one piece please.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

51:58.051 --> 51:59.531
Not listening at all.

51:59.618 --> 52:02.229
So, I'm gonna intro you
to my posse.

52:02.317 --> 52:05.189
We're flying to
my mom's resort in Sumatra.

52:05.276 --> 52:09.106
She's closed down
the whole place just for us.

52:09.193 --> 52:11.021
We're gonna have so much fun.

52:11.108 --> 52:13.980
Come on, meet the girls.
Girls, this is Rachel Chu.

52:14.067 --> 52:15.068
Hi!

52:20.509 --> 52:22.598
So you let Bernard Tai
organize all of this?

52:22.685 --> 52:23.686
Yeah.

52:24.774 --> 52:25.818
Bernard.

52:25.905 --> 52:26.993
Hey.

52:27.994 --> 52:30.301
This is for you, asshole.

52:33.870 --> 52:38.614
Tina! Tini!
The twins are in the house!

52:38.701 --> 52:42.618
I'm so glad you made it!
How are you?

52:42.705 --> 52:44.315
It's easy to make
a killer entrance

52:44.402 --> 52:46.230
when you come
as a matching set.

52:46.317 --> 52:49.189
Hi, we haven't met.
I'm Amanda Ling.

52:49.276 --> 52:51.496
Hi, I'm Rachel Chu.

52:51.583 --> 52:53.498
Oh, you're
Nick Young's friend.

52:53.585 --> 52:55.935
- Yeah.
- Word gets around fast here.

52:56.022 --> 52:58.329
You're a professor
at NYU, right?

52:58.416 --> 53:00.636
Yes. Um, what about you?

53:00.723 --> 53:02.855
Oh, I'm a lawyer.
General counsel

53:02.942 --> 53:04.988
to the Young Family
Corporation, actually.

53:05.075 --> 53:06.598
That's very impressive.

53:06.685 --> 53:09.427
Mmm. Nah. Just good,
old-fashioned nepotism.

53:09.514 --> 53:12.343
I grew up with Nick and Colin.
We're family friends.

53:12.430 --> 53:14.214
It's nice to meet you,
Rachel Chu.

53:15.955 --> 53:19.742
Ladies, come on.
We're wheels up in five.

53:19.829 --> 53:20.830
Let's do this?

53:20.917 --> 53:22.222
Let's go.

53:28.533 --> 53:30.796
Yeah!

53:30.883 --> 53:34.017
All I wanted was a weekend
away with my boys.

53:34.104 --> 53:36.628
And some beer.
Maybe some rugby.

53:36.715 --> 53:38.978
Don't worry. It's gonna be
great, whatever happens.

53:39.065 --> 53:40.327
Yeah.

53:40.415 --> 53:42.199
Let's make
some babies!

53:42.286 --> 53:45.158
I don't think it will be.

53:56.213 --> 53:58.955
Any asshole can plan
a normal stag party.

53:59.042 --> 54:02.306
Hookers, drugs, dog-fighting.

54:02.393 --> 54:05.048
That's minor league shit.

54:05.135 --> 54:07.398
To organize a party
this massive...

54:07.485 --> 54:09.487
Takes a massive asshole.

54:09.574 --> 54:12.229
...takes a goddamn mastermind.

54:12.316 --> 54:14.100
Where exactly is this party?

54:15.841 --> 54:17.103
It's right there.

54:21.717 --> 54:22.979
Bloody hell!

54:33.903 --> 54:34.947
Whoo!

55:05.369 --> 55:07.023
Did you just see that?

55:07.110 --> 55:08.894
Oh, my God, Nick.
What are you worried about?

55:08.981 --> 55:10.200
You don't have to
keep Rachel happy.

55:10.287 --> 55:11.636
She's just lucky to be here.

55:11.723 --> 55:13.116
Nice, Eddie.

55:13.203 --> 55:14.813
Oh, what?

55:14.900 --> 55:16.598
So we're gonna pretend
like that's not the truth?

55:16.685 --> 55:17.816
Are we in some kind of
fairy tale story

55:17.903 --> 55:19.122
that I don't know about?

55:19.209 --> 55:20.384
Did you find a shoe
at midnight

55:20.471 --> 55:21.951
and jump in a pumpkin?

55:22.038 --> 55:24.214
Yo, I got so much shit
about marrying Fiona,

55:24.301 --> 55:25.781
and her parents own

55:25.868 --> 55:27.870
the biggest shipping company
in Hong Kong.

55:27.957 --> 55:30.176
Hey, Araminta's adorable,
but you think your dad

55:30.263 --> 55:31.917
would be spending millions
on this wedding

55:32.004 --> 55:35.007
if her parents didn't own
a billion-dollar resort chain?

55:35.094 --> 55:37.183
What's Rachel bringing
to the table?

55:37.270 --> 55:39.664
Oh! Small tits!

55:39.751 --> 55:41.187
Oh!

55:41.274 --> 55:44.147
Hey. It's not worth it, man.
They're drunk.

55:44.234 --> 55:47.977
Hey, guys,
this is boring. Massage time.

55:48.064 --> 55:50.806
And you, the bachelor,

55:50.893 --> 55:53.504
you're gonna get one
before this weekend is over.

55:53.591 --> 55:57.116
Or we're gonna tie you up
and shave your coo coo chara.

55:58.770 --> 56:00.424
Coo coo chara!

56:00.511 --> 56:02.557
Hey, come try this.

56:03.949 --> 56:05.734
We have to get off this ship.

56:17.136 --> 56:20.096
Welcome to paradise.

56:20.183 --> 56:23.447
This is Samsara Island.

56:25.797 --> 56:28.408
This weekend
is about sisterhood

56:28.495 --> 56:32.761
and connecting
with the divine in all of us.

56:32.848 --> 56:36.852
So, I hope you'll all find
your bliss,

56:36.939 --> 56:40.812
starting with an all-paid
shopping spree

56:40.899 --> 56:42.901
at the fashion boutique!

56:48.341 --> 56:51.083
Come on! Come on!

56:53.956 --> 56:55.305
Bitch, I saw this first!

56:55.392 --> 56:56.567
But you have ping pong tits!

56:56.654 --> 56:57.655
What about
your mosquito bites?

56:57.742 --> 56:59.526
- No!
- You know it's true!

56:59.614 --> 57:03.922
One more minute!
You keep what you can carry.

57:04.009 --> 57:08.884
One more minute!
You keep what you can carry.

57:08.971 --> 57:12.888
Yeah, no one loves free stuff
more than rich people.

57:12.975 --> 57:14.846
Just the one dress for you?

57:14.933 --> 57:17.327
I don't wanna lose an arm.

57:17.414 --> 57:20.069
Ooh. Well, in that case,

57:23.507 --> 57:25.074
one last touch.

57:33.256 --> 57:35.127
Well, isn't Nick a lucky guy.

57:35.214 --> 57:36.433
Time's up!

57:36.520 --> 57:39.088
Next stop... Spa!

57:46.095 --> 57:48.010
You're a genius.
You know that, right?

57:48.097 --> 57:49.620
What's a best man for?

57:49.707 --> 57:51.840
Guess that pilot's license
came in handy after all.

57:51.927 --> 57:53.537
Here you go, champ.

57:53.624 --> 57:55.234
Oh, thank you, sir.

57:55.321 --> 57:57.715
Mmm. I think that is the best
beer I've ever had.

57:57.802 --> 58:00.370
I'm gonna have to agree
with you on that.

58:03.808 --> 58:05.201
You know,
if it wasn't for Araminta,

58:05.288 --> 58:06.855
I'd ask you to marry me.

58:09.335 --> 58:10.510
Although,

58:12.904 --> 58:14.166
there is a little something

58:14.253 --> 58:15.385
that might get
in the way of that.

58:18.518 --> 58:20.129
Mmm.

58:20.216 --> 58:22.522
- No!
- Yeah.

58:22.609 --> 58:24.829
- Is that real?
- Yes.

58:24.916 --> 58:26.483
- Wow! Yes!
- Yes.

58:26.570 --> 58:28.485
Yes, man! Congratulations!

58:28.572 --> 58:30.617
- I know.
- That is freaking amazing.

58:30.705 --> 58:32.184
- I'm ready.
- You're ready.

58:32.271 --> 58:34.230
You're doing it.

58:34.317 --> 58:36.275
Nick, I'm really happy
for you, man.

58:36.362 --> 58:38.190
Thanks, dude.

58:47.417 --> 58:49.680
I think my masseuse
just got me pregnant.

58:55.338 --> 58:58.210
I can see why Nick put off
coming back to Singapore.

58:58.994 --> 59:00.647
What do you mean?

59:00.735 --> 59:03.650
You know, he was supposed
to come back last year,

59:03.738 --> 59:06.001
take over the family business.

59:06.088 --> 59:08.481
His parents freaked out
when he didn't.

59:08.568 --> 59:12.921
But, now that he's back,
I'm sure all is forgiven.

59:13.008 --> 59:14.836
But he's not back
for good.

59:14.923 --> 59:16.663
I mean,
we're just here for a wedding.

59:20.798 --> 59:22.278
Wow!

59:23.932 --> 59:24.976
But?

59:25.063 --> 59:27.370
No, I'm really happy for you.

59:27.457 --> 59:29.459
Colin, I've known you
since you were in nappies.

59:29.546 --> 59:31.853
I know when there's something
on your mind.

59:31.940 --> 59:34.769
Well, it wasn't
that long ago

59:34.856 --> 59:38.076
that you were sure
you were moving back home.

59:38.163 --> 59:41.950
And I mean, Rachel loves
her job in New York.

59:43.212 --> 59:45.867
Yeah, we're gonna
figure that out.

59:45.954 --> 59:49.044
You're going to
figure it out. Right.

59:49.131 --> 59:51.829
Rachel, I get it.

59:51.916 --> 59:53.222
It's hard knowing
where you stand

59:53.309 --> 59:55.137
with someone
like Nicholas Young.

59:55.224 --> 59:57.704
He has all that pressure
from his family.

59:57.792 --> 01:00:01.708
Not just in business,
but in who he's dating.

01:00:01.796 --> 01:00:03.928
It's like, you just never know

01:00:04.015 --> 01:00:06.583
what's quite going on
in that gorgeous head of his.

01:00:09.978 --> 01:00:12.937
Nick told you that
we were together, right?

01:00:13.024 --> 01:00:15.505
It's ancient history now.

01:00:15.592 --> 01:00:18.900
Although our families,
particularly his mother,

01:00:18.987 --> 01:00:22.207
always wanted us
to get married.

01:00:22.294 --> 01:00:23.861
I guess we weren't ready then.

01:00:23.948 --> 01:00:26.516
Dude, ever since
primary school,

01:00:26.603 --> 01:00:28.344
you were always going to be

01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:30.868
the next chairman
of the Young Corporation,

01:00:30.955 --> 01:00:33.044
your family's shining heir.

01:00:33.131 --> 01:00:34.480
You really think
your family's going to

01:00:34.567 --> 01:00:36.831
accept anything
less than that?

01:00:36.918 --> 01:00:38.441
I mean, unless you...

01:00:39.659 --> 01:00:40.791
No.

01:00:42.227 --> 01:00:44.664
Are you thinking
of walking out?

01:00:44.751 --> 01:00:47.319
Leaving everything
to bloody Alistair and Eddie?

01:00:47.406 --> 01:00:49.452
I'm not walking out
on anything.

01:00:49.539 --> 01:00:52.934
I met a girl, I fell in love
and I want to marry her.

01:00:53.021 --> 01:00:55.414
And it can't just be
one thing or the other.

01:00:55.501 --> 01:00:57.112
Uh... No, no, no.

01:00:57.199 --> 01:01:00.463
It's not that simple.
You know that.

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:02.552
I really admire you.

01:01:02.639 --> 01:01:05.816
It takes guts
coming all the way over here,

01:01:05.903 --> 01:01:07.774
facing Nick's family.

01:01:07.862 --> 01:01:12.170
Especially when Eleanor isn't
exactly in your corner.

01:01:12.257 --> 01:01:14.564
Okay, your family aside,
have you ever thought about

01:01:14.651 --> 01:01:16.914
what your relationship
with Rachel

01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:19.351
will be like
if you got married?

01:01:19.438 --> 01:01:20.875
I mean, okay,

01:01:20.962 --> 01:01:22.920
you're Nicholas Young.
You're untouchable.

01:01:23.007 --> 01:01:27.794
You always have been.
But Rachel's not.

01:01:27.882 --> 01:01:30.972
And if she becomes
Mrs. Nicholas Young,

01:01:31.059 --> 01:01:33.278
every day for her
is going to be a struggle.

01:01:38.675 --> 01:01:42.722
I heard she told Tini
that Nick is a good catch.

01:01:42.809 --> 01:01:45.595
So typical.
She's not even that pretty.

01:01:45.682 --> 01:01:48.815
It's like she's never heard
of plastic surgery.

01:01:48.903 --> 01:01:50.382
Oh, shit.

01:01:56.736 --> 01:01:58.173
Sorry.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.826
You sure she's ready for that?

01:02:08.574 --> 01:02:09.836
Rachel?

01:02:17.714 --> 01:02:19.890
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

01:02:19.977 --> 01:02:22.240
Let's just forget
about those girls.

01:02:22.327 --> 01:02:23.459
Camp out here

01:02:23.546 --> 01:02:24.590
and order room service?

01:02:36.341 --> 01:02:37.429
I'll call security.

01:02:37.516 --> 01:02:38.604
No.

01:02:40.911 --> 01:02:44.306
I'm not gonna make a scene.

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:46.699
I'm not gonna give them
the satisfaction.

01:02:52.749 --> 01:02:56.187
This weekend was supposed
to be mani-pedis,

01:02:56.274 --> 01:02:58.668
cocktails served
in pineapples.

01:02:58.755 --> 01:03:01.149
This definitely wasn't
on the menu.

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:04.021
Why would Araminta even have
friends like that?

01:03:04.108 --> 01:03:05.892
They're so mean.

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.112
Well, you grow up
your whole lives together,

01:03:08.199 --> 01:03:09.809
you make excuses for people.

01:03:10.985 --> 01:03:13.074
Specially the morons.

01:03:13.161 --> 01:03:15.554
I mean, I know Michael didn't
have to deal with catty,

01:03:15.641 --> 01:03:18.644
fish-killing sociopaths.

01:03:18.731 --> 01:03:20.995
How did you two
get through all this?

01:03:22.909 --> 01:03:27.218
Well, I didn't have it quite
as bad, but it wasn't pretty.

01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:32.093
Well, at least tell me
it gets better.

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.312
Of course it does.

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:39.883
You okay?

01:03:41.363 --> 01:03:42.538
Yeah.

01:03:56.856 --> 01:04:00.817
Actually... No.

01:04:06.866 --> 01:04:08.477
You could talk to me.

01:04:16.267 --> 01:04:19.140
Michael is having an affair.

01:04:28.062 --> 01:04:30.107
I'm really sorry, Astrid.

01:05:00.181 --> 01:05:02.400
I thought I was here
to meet your family,

01:05:02.487 --> 01:05:04.663
go to your best friend's
wedding, eat some good food.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:07.536
Instead, I feel like I'm
a villain in a soap opera

01:05:07.623 --> 01:05:10.626
who's plotting to steal
your family fortune.

01:05:11.801 --> 01:05:13.542
What happened?

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:16.153
I mean, I met Amanda.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.068
She told me
that everyone here thinks

01:05:18.155 --> 01:05:19.330
that I'm the evil person

01:05:19.417 --> 01:05:20.810
that prevented you
from moving back

01:05:20.897 --> 01:05:21.985
to Singapore last year,

01:05:22.072 --> 01:05:23.247
when I didn't even know

01:05:23.334 --> 01:05:25.467
you were supposed
to come home.

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:27.556
You have every reason
to be upset.

01:05:27.643 --> 01:05:29.166
I'm not done yet.

01:05:29.253 --> 01:05:33.170
There was also this gutted,
bloody fish

01:05:33.257 --> 01:05:35.172
that Araminta's friends
left for me

01:05:35.259 --> 01:05:36.565
in my hotel room

01:05:36.652 --> 01:05:38.436
on my bed next to the words,

01:05:38.523 --> 01:05:41.483
"Catch this,
you gold-digging bitch."

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:44.529
Written in big,
fat serial-killer letters.

01:05:44.616 --> 01:05:46.879
Is that all that happened?

01:05:46.966 --> 01:05:48.968
I mean, please tell me
that's all that happened.

01:05:49.055 --> 01:05:50.361
You know what?
I don't even care

01:05:50.448 --> 01:05:51.710
about those stupid girls

01:05:51.797 --> 01:05:53.538
with their stupid little
designer handbags

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:54.931
and sunglasses.
I don't care about that.

01:05:55.018 --> 01:05:56.280
I don't care
that your ex-girlfriend

01:05:56.367 --> 01:05:57.716
told me all this crap.

01:05:57.803 --> 01:05:58.978
It's that you didn't
tell me any of it.

01:05:59.849 --> 01:06:01.111
I screwed up.

01:06:01.198 --> 01:06:02.243
Why? Were you trying
to test me?

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:03.679
I really
messed up, okay?

01:06:03.766 --> 01:06:05.550
- Why would you do that?
- I made a mistake.

01:06:05.637 --> 01:06:09.119
When we first met,
you had no idea who I was,

01:06:09.206 --> 01:06:11.165
who my family were.
You didn't care!

01:06:11.252 --> 01:06:13.732
Yeah, I don't care
about that stupid stuff.

01:06:13.819 --> 01:06:16.344
Well, exactly.

01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:18.998
You are so different
from all of the women

01:06:19.085 --> 01:06:20.522
that I grew up with.

01:06:22.263 --> 01:06:24.526
And I love who I am
around you.

01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:29.487
I don't want that to change.

01:06:29.574 --> 01:06:33.404
- And that's selfish, I know.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:06:33.491 --> 01:06:35.363
I'm sorry that you had to deal
with that on your own.

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:40.933
But I'm here now.

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.284
Whatever happens,
we'll get through it together.

01:06:43.371 --> 01:06:45.155
Dead fish and all.

01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:47.984
All right?

01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:49.333
It was so gross.

01:06:50.813 --> 01:06:52.118
But I buried it.

01:06:55.165 --> 01:06:56.471
You dealt with it.

01:06:58.212 --> 01:06:59.604
Come here.

01:07:03.826 --> 01:07:05.523
You know what? We need to do
something tonight.

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:07.395
We need to do something
that's just you and me, okay?

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:09.397
- 100% agree.
- Yes.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:13.618
But we do have to go
make some dumplings first.

01:07:14.706 --> 01:07:15.794
Okay?

01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:17.100
And can we eat them?

01:07:17.187 --> 01:07:18.319
We can eat
as many as you like.

01:07:18.406 --> 01:07:19.668
Okay, fine.

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:47.913
This is too much.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.046
We're hosting
a rehearsal dinner,

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:52.396
not feeding an army.

01:07:52.483 --> 01:07:54.703
Better too many than have
people say we're stingy.

01:07:55.878 --> 01:07:58.141
So, right.

01:07:58.228 --> 01:08:01.100
You put the baby in bed.

01:08:01.187 --> 01:08:06.323
You tuck, tuck, tuck.
Same on the other side.

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:08.456
You give him
a kiss good night.

01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:10.284
That's so cute.

01:08:10.371 --> 01:08:12.111
- How's that?
- And then you eat the baby.

01:08:12.198 --> 01:08:14.418
Then you eat the baby
after he's cooked.

01:08:14.505 --> 01:08:16.072
No, you gotta
make sure he's cooked.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.160
Did your Ah Mateach you that?

01:08:17.247 --> 01:08:19.162
She did.

01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:20.642
I, on the other hand,

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.252
was taught
by Grand-Auntie Mabel.

01:08:22.339 --> 01:08:24.645
You put the Botox in the face,

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:28.084
and then
you pinch, pinch, pinch.

01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:30.738
Then, voila!

01:08:30.826 --> 01:08:32.828
Did you guys all learn
when you were kids?

01:08:32.915 --> 01:08:34.176
We didn't have a choice.

01:08:34.264 --> 01:08:35.874
We taught you so you'd know

01:08:35.961 --> 01:08:37.788
the blood, sweat,
and tears it took

01:08:37.876 --> 01:08:39.529
to raise and feed you monkeys.

01:08:39.617 --> 01:08:41.053
Not like the ang-mohs

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:42.925
microwaving macaroni
and cheese

01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:44.229
for their own children.

01:08:44.318 --> 01:08:46.015
No wonder
they put their parents

01:08:46.102 --> 01:08:47.799
in the old folks' home
when they all grow up.

01:08:47.886 --> 01:08:49.714
I know!

01:08:49.801 --> 01:08:52.412
Ah Masays if we don't pass
traditions down like this,

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.415
they'll disappear.

01:08:54.502 --> 01:08:56.546
God forbid, we lose
the ancient Chinese tradition

01:08:56.634 --> 01:08:57.983
of guilting your children.

01:08:59.462 --> 01:09:00.856
It's totally worth it.

01:09:00.943 --> 01:09:02.423
Mother used to wait for me
after school

01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:04.425
with a nice basket of these.

01:09:08.951 --> 01:09:11.562
Hey, I never got
after-school dumplings.

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:13.042
Well, that's because
Auntie Felicity

01:09:13.129 --> 01:09:15.174
was doing after-school
microdermabrasion.

01:09:23.835 --> 01:09:26.621
Auntie, this is Dolce.

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:28.404
You speak Cantonese?

01:09:28.492 --> 01:09:30.363
No, I don't.

01:09:30.451 --> 01:09:33.715
It's just great seeing
you guys all like this.

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:35.281
When I was growing up,

01:09:35.368 --> 01:09:38.154
it was just me and my mom,
which I loved.

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:40.895
But we didn't really have
a big family like this.

01:09:40.983 --> 01:09:42.854
It's really nice.

01:09:42.941 --> 01:09:45.203
Oh, that's so lovely
of you to say, Rachel.

01:09:45.291 --> 01:09:47.468
We are all very lucky
to have each other.

01:09:49.731 --> 01:09:52.777
That's a beautiful ring,
Auntie Eleanor.

01:09:52.863 --> 01:09:55.301
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:09:55.389 --> 01:09:58.435
Nick's father had it made
when he proposed to me.

01:09:58.522 --> 01:10:02.483
That's very romantic.
How did you guys meet?

01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:04.528
Actually, they met
at Cambridge.

01:10:04.615 --> 01:10:06.182
They were both
studying law together.

01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:07.662
Oh, I didn't know
you were a lawyer.

01:10:07.749 --> 01:10:09.620
I wasn't.
I withdrew from university

01:10:09.707 --> 01:10:10.882
when we got married.

01:10:10.969 --> 01:10:12.406
Oh.

01:10:12.493 --> 01:10:14.277
I chose to help my husband
run a business

01:10:14.364 --> 01:10:16.018
and to raise a family.

01:10:16.105 --> 01:10:18.803
For me, it was a privilege.

01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:20.979
But for you, you may think
it's old-fashioned.

01:10:22.503 --> 01:10:25.070
It's nice
you appreciate this house

01:10:25.157 --> 01:10:27.769
and us being here together
wrapping dumplings.

01:10:27.856 --> 01:10:30.598
But all this
doesn't just happen.

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:33.209
It's because we know
to put family first,

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:35.733
instead of chasing
one's passion.

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.002
Ah Ma...

01:10:45.482 --> 01:10:46.570
Thank you.

01:10:46.657 --> 01:10:48.093
Oh, Nick.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:49.443
Come and sit.

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:05.502
Mmm.

01:11:06.068 --> 01:11:07.461
Mmm.

01:11:50.025 --> 01:11:53.245
Oh, hi.
I think I'm a little lost.

01:11:53.332 --> 01:11:54.725
This house is pretty big.

01:11:58.076 --> 01:12:00.078
I'm glad I found you.

01:12:00.165 --> 01:12:02.559
I am afraid
that I've been unfair.

01:12:02.646 --> 01:12:04.039
Oh, no, you know what?

01:12:04.126 --> 01:12:05.910
I'm sorry
I made an assumption.

01:12:05.997 --> 01:12:07.259
I didn't mean to offend you.

01:12:07.346 --> 01:12:08.347
Not at all.

01:12:09.697 --> 01:12:12.047
You asked about my ring.

01:12:12.134 --> 01:12:15.006
The truth is
Nick's father had it made

01:12:15.093 --> 01:12:17.792
when he wanted
to propose to me

01:12:17.879 --> 01:12:21.012
because Ah Mawouldn't
give him the family ring.

01:12:21.099 --> 01:12:23.537
I wasn't her first choice.

01:12:23.624 --> 01:12:27.715
Honestly, I wasn't her second.

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:30.761
Gosh, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

01:12:30.848 --> 01:12:32.894
I didn't come
from the right family,

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.678
have the right connections.

01:12:34.765 --> 01:12:36.158
And Ah Mathought
I would not make

01:12:36.245 --> 01:12:37.681
an adequate wife to her son.

01:12:37.768 --> 01:12:40.554
But she came around,
obviously.

01:12:43.339 --> 01:12:45.950
It took many years,

01:12:46.037 --> 01:12:48.692
and she had good reason
to be concerned.

01:12:48.779 --> 01:12:51.869
Because I had no idea
the work

01:12:51.956 --> 01:12:54.916
and the sacrifice
it would take.

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:57.222
There were many days
when I wondered

01:12:57.309 --> 01:13:00.356
if I would ever measure up.

01:13:00.443 --> 01:13:02.706
But having been through
it all,

01:13:03.968 --> 01:13:05.709
I know this much.

01:13:11.585 --> 01:13:14.022
You will never be enough.

01:13:18.635 --> 01:13:22.639
We should head back.
I wouldn't want Nick to worry.

01:13:38.394 --> 01:13:39.656
You all right?

01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:41.571
Yeah.

01:13:44.574 --> 01:13:46.228
I know my mum
can be tough at times,

01:13:46.315 --> 01:13:51.146
but there isn't anything
she wouldn't do for me.

01:13:51.233 --> 01:13:54.628
And there is a reason why
I lived with Ah Magrowing up.

01:13:54.715 --> 01:13:57.892
It's because my mother knew
she wasn't the favorite.

01:13:57.979 --> 01:14:01.373
So she let her raise me,
so I would be.

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:04.986
You were just a kid?

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:07.336
Yeah.

01:14:07.423 --> 01:14:11.688
But it's hard to understand
from the outside.

01:14:14.343 --> 01:14:17.346
But she did what she thought
was best for the family.

01:14:17.433 --> 01:14:19.435
- Mmm-hmm.
- For everyone involved.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:24.658
Anyway, I think I've had
enough with dumplings

01:14:24.745 --> 01:14:26.921
for the rest of my life.

01:14:27.008 --> 01:14:28.923
What should we do?

01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:31.969
Sushi, movies,
anything you like. Really.

01:14:35.059 --> 01:14:36.844
Wait, what?

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:39.498
Was she like, "You will never
be good enough for my son"?

01:14:39.585 --> 01:14:42.110
Or was it like, "You...

01:14:42.197 --> 01:14:44.199
"You will never be good enough
for my son"?

01:14:45.722 --> 01:14:47.115
- It's like the second one.
- Oh.

01:14:47.202 --> 01:14:48.899
Except for in a way
that made me wanna cry

01:14:48.986 --> 01:14:50.205
and puke at the same time.

01:14:50.292 --> 01:14:52.642
Gosh, she's so badass.

01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:53.948
You know,
I bet if you told her

01:14:54.035 --> 01:14:55.601
you'd leave Nick
for a million dollars,

01:14:55.689 --> 01:14:57.734
she will write that check.
They do that around here.

01:14:57.821 --> 01:14:59.867
And she looked at me
like I was nothing.

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:01.346
Like a $10 million check.

01:15:01.433 --> 01:15:02.739
I feel like she would do that.

01:15:02.826 --> 01:15:04.741
I don't even know
what I should do.

01:15:04.828 --> 01:15:07.570
I mean, I can't even tell Nick
because he worships her.

01:15:07.657 --> 01:15:09.572
Yeah, Chinese sons
think their moms

01:15:09.659 --> 01:15:11.661
fart Chanel No. 5.

01:15:11.748 --> 01:15:14.795
What about the Ah Ma?
Does she hate your face, too?

01:15:14.882 --> 01:15:17.536
Okay, nobody said
they hated my face.

01:15:17.623 --> 01:15:22.324
And Ah Ma, she liked my face.
She said I had a lucky nose.

01:15:22.411 --> 01:15:23.934
That's great!

01:15:24.021 --> 01:15:25.588
You know, Eleanor can hate you
all day long,

01:15:25.675 --> 01:15:29.157
but you can't beat 2,000 years
of Chinese filial piety.

01:15:29.244 --> 01:15:31.507
I feel like I shouldn't
even go to the wedding.

01:15:31.594 --> 01:15:33.639
You know,
it's Colin and Araminta's day.

01:15:33.727 --> 01:15:34.989
I don't wanna cause
any drama there.

01:15:35.076 --> 01:15:38.166
I feel like I should just
sit it out.

01:15:38.253 --> 01:15:40.821
You know? Tell Nick I had
food poisoning or something.

01:15:43.954 --> 01:15:46.087
- What?
- That's bullshit.

01:15:46.174 --> 01:15:48.132
- You're just scared.
- No, I'm not.

01:15:48.219 --> 01:15:51.179
Okay, here's what you need to
understand. All right?

01:15:51.266 --> 01:15:53.311
It's not about getting Eleanor
to like you.

01:15:53.398 --> 01:15:56.358
It's about getting her
to respect you, all right?

01:15:56.445 --> 01:15:59.491
Right now, she just thinks
you're some undeserving,

01:15:59.578 --> 01:16:02.451
- clueless, gold-digging...
- Yeah, I got it.

01:16:02.538 --> 01:16:05.628
...trashy, unrefined banana.

01:16:05.715 --> 01:16:07.978
Yellow on the outside,
white on the inside.

01:16:08.065 --> 01:16:10.241
I know what a banana is.

01:16:10.328 --> 01:16:12.940
When, in reality, you're
a super sophisticated, smart

01:16:13.027 --> 01:16:15.551
professor of
freaking game theory.

01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:17.335
Show her that side of you,
you know?

01:16:18.162 --> 01:16:19.163
You're right.

01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:20.425
Damn straight, I'm right.

01:16:20.512 --> 01:16:22.123
It's Peik Lin,
I'm always right.

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.472
Yeah, she's like
trying to play

01:16:23.559 --> 01:16:25.126
a game of chicken with me.

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:27.345
Where she's like coming at me,
and thinking

01:16:27.432 --> 01:16:28.694
I'm going to swerve
like a chicken.

01:16:28.782 --> 01:16:30.044
But you can't swerve.

01:16:30.131 --> 01:16:31.567
I'm not gonna swerve.
Not for her.

01:16:31.654 --> 01:16:33.264
No.
Chickens are bitches, dude!

01:16:33.351 --> 01:16:35.266
- And I'm not a chicken.
- You're not a chicken.

01:16:35.353 --> 01:16:36.877
You're gonna roll up
to that wedding,

01:16:36.964 --> 01:16:38.400
you're gonna be like,
"Bak-bak, bitch!"

01:16:38.487 --> 01:16:39.793
Bak-bak, bitch!

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.056
Chickens are bitches.

01:16:42.143 --> 01:16:44.188
Sorry, Uncle.

01:16:44.275 --> 01:16:45.624
What are you doing tonight?

01:16:45.711 --> 01:16:47.801
I was gonna go to FedEx
or something.

01:16:47.888 --> 01:16:50.368
Why? Oh!

01:16:50.455 --> 01:16:53.328
I have been waiting to
do this properly for so long.

01:16:53.415 --> 01:16:55.591
I'm thinking eyebrow triage,
root crimps,

01:16:55.678 --> 01:16:56.940
maybe some eyelid tape.

01:16:57.027 --> 01:16:59.029
What do you think?

01:16:59.116 --> 01:17:00.944
Ugh. All of it.

01:17:01.031 --> 01:17:03.686
And I would throw in
a Korean snail face mask.

01:17:03.773 --> 01:17:07.255
Sweetie, your skin is so dry,
it's hurting my face.

01:17:07.342 --> 01:17:08.560
Thank you.

01:17:08.647 --> 01:17:09.910
You know, it's about time

01:17:09.997 --> 01:17:11.781
someone stood up
to Auntie Eleanor.

01:17:11.868 --> 01:17:13.348
Well, you, not me. Oh, God!

01:17:13.435 --> 01:17:14.566
She can't know
I was ever here.

01:17:14.653 --> 01:17:16.307
Oh, no.

01:17:16.394 --> 01:17:19.745
Right. Well, okay, let's get
to work. Cappuccinos.

01:17:30.931 --> 01:17:33.107
Pull the plum Balenciaga,
the peach Chloe,

01:17:33.194 --> 01:17:35.631
the Giambattista,
all the Bottegas.

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:37.720
Oh, and that Jason Wu with
the deconstructed ruffles.

01:17:37.807 --> 01:17:39.635
And a sandwich for Peik Lin.

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:42.507
- Oh! Okay. All right.
- Oh. Right.

01:17:42.594 --> 01:17:43.900
I'm not sure if it's working

01:17:43.987 --> 01:17:47.295
or if she looks like
a clown's tampon.

01:17:47.382 --> 01:17:49.036
On a heavy day.

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:51.125
You look like a flower.

01:17:51.212 --> 01:17:54.955
A sad, lonely flower
no one wants to be around.

01:17:58.915 --> 01:18:00.699
I mean, it's the wedding
of the century.

01:18:00.786 --> 01:18:02.527
So, of course, we're here.
It's the natural...

01:18:03.615 --> 01:18:05.530
Oh!

01:18:06.444 --> 01:18:10.840
It's not that bad.

01:18:10.927 --> 01:18:12.494
It's holding you up.

01:18:12.581 --> 01:18:14.496
It's a hands-on dress.
You know what I mean?

01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:15.758
Incoming.

01:18:16.498 --> 01:18:17.542
Okay.

01:18:22.199 --> 01:18:23.766
I love my fans.

01:18:23.853 --> 01:18:26.290
Taipei Tiger 2is going
to redefine the genre.

01:18:26.377 --> 01:18:28.510
- She's a star. She's a star.
- TT2,honey.

01:18:28.597 --> 01:18:29.772
Oh!

01:18:29.859 --> 01:18:31.252
I'm blinded by the light.

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:32.993
This is why disco died.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.343
You kind of look
like a slutty Ebola virus.

01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:38.694
It's like a bag of Skittles.
Taste the rainbow.

01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:40.043
Could work if we...

01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:41.915
Yes. I think
we just ought to...

01:18:42.002 --> 01:18:45.135
I just think if we could tell
her this is coming from you

01:18:45.222 --> 01:18:46.963
'cause she probably doesn't
want to hear it from a guy.

01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:48.095
Okay. Okay.

01:18:49.835 --> 01:18:51.925
Okay, remember.
Optimal angles.

01:19:08.245 --> 01:19:09.986
Just right here!
Just right here!

01:19:19.648 --> 01:19:20.779
Ma'am.

01:19:30.615 --> 01:19:32.748
Everyone, I've got
Rachel Chu of New York.

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:34.271
Rachel Chu of New York.

01:19:39.276 --> 01:19:41.017
Rachel! Rachel! To me!

01:19:41.104 --> 01:19:43.367
Okay, ladies, looking good.

01:19:43.454 --> 01:19:44.934
Out of the way, please.
Out of the way.

01:19:45.021 --> 01:19:47.632
- So gorgeous!
- Thank you.

01:19:47.719 --> 01:19:48.982
Ladies, move, please.
Out of the way!

01:19:50.722 --> 01:19:53.116
Good, that's great.
Beautiful dress.

01:19:53.987 --> 01:19:55.379
Ladies.

01:19:57.555 --> 01:19:58.730
Amanda.

01:19:58.817 --> 01:20:01.255
- Mmm.
- You're in my way.

01:20:04.606 --> 01:20:06.738
Okay, what?

01:20:09.828 --> 01:20:12.309
Our Chinese investors
are getting nervous.

01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:14.355
I have to fly in to Shenzhen
on Monday

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:16.966
to try and talk them down.

01:20:17.053 --> 01:20:18.924
That's Cassian's birthday.

01:20:20.230 --> 01:20:22.580
Yeah, I know.

01:20:22.667 --> 01:20:27.890
I hate to miss it,
but this is important.

01:20:27.977 --> 01:20:30.762
You'd think your son's
birthday's important.

01:20:30.849 --> 01:20:32.547
Get someone else to handle it.

01:20:37.073 --> 01:20:41.338
Unless there's another reason
you're out of town?

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:45.081
What are you saying?

01:20:54.351 --> 01:20:56.223
I know
you're having an affair.

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:58.355
Oh, Jesus. Astrid.

01:20:58.442 --> 01:21:00.966
Let's just
get through the wedding,

01:21:01.054 --> 01:21:02.533
and we'll deal with it after.

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:04.579
I don't wanna make a scene.

01:21:08.365 --> 01:21:09.845
You find out
I'm having an affair

01:21:09.932 --> 01:21:11.281
with another woman,

01:21:11.368 --> 01:21:13.762
and you're worried
about making a scene?

01:21:13.849 --> 01:21:16.634
You'd rather I scream
and carry on?

01:21:16.721 --> 01:21:20.638
Yes. Honestly,
I wish you would.

01:21:20.725 --> 01:21:22.945
It would show you cared about
more than what people thought

01:21:23.032 --> 01:21:25.643
of you and your family.

01:21:25.730 --> 01:21:27.819
Don't try and turn this on me.

01:21:27.906 --> 01:21:29.865
I'm not the one
who screwed up!

01:21:29.952 --> 01:21:31.301
Of course not.

01:21:31.388 --> 01:21:33.521
You're always the prettiest,

01:21:33.608 --> 01:21:35.740
richest, most perfect girl
in the room.

01:21:35.827 --> 01:21:37.046
While I'm just
this lucky bastard

01:21:37.133 --> 01:21:38.482
who will never measure up.

01:21:38.569 --> 01:21:40.005
Don't say that.

01:21:40.093 --> 01:21:42.051
I know
what you're thinking, Astrid.

01:21:42.138 --> 01:21:43.835
That's why
you hide your shoes,

01:21:43.922 --> 01:21:45.663
the jewelry you buy,

01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:48.231
as if every minute of my life
I'm not reminded of it.

01:21:49.624 --> 01:21:52.279
I'm just tired.

01:21:52.366 --> 01:21:55.717
I'm tired of having nothing
I do matter.

01:21:55.804 --> 01:21:58.372
Including having the affair.

01:21:58.459 --> 01:22:01.984
Of course
what you do matters!

01:22:02.071 --> 01:22:05.422
How can you say that?

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.105
Is this a church
or a paddy field?

01:22:36.192 --> 01:22:38.368
They spent 40 million
on the wedding.

01:22:38.455 --> 01:22:40.283
Really? That's too much.

01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:42.155
We're Methodists.
20 million is our limit.

01:22:42.242 --> 01:22:43.286
I know.

01:22:43.373 --> 01:22:47.464
Princess Intan. Vicious woman.

01:22:47.551 --> 01:22:50.902
I heard she demanded
a whole row to herself,

01:22:50.989 --> 01:22:53.253
so she wouldn't be bothered
by anyone.

01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.341
Really?

01:22:57.779 --> 01:22:59.389
Who is that?

01:23:12.837 --> 01:23:14.187
Aunties.

01:23:15.710 --> 01:23:19.235
Rachel, how lovely to see you.

01:23:19.322 --> 01:23:21.019
The pleasure is all mine.

01:23:22.586 --> 01:23:24.936
I'm sorry,
our row is full.

01:23:33.684 --> 01:23:35.991
I love it.

01:23:39.951 --> 01:23:43.433
Bak-bak. Okay.

01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:55.576
Princess Intan. Rachel Chu.

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:58.405
I read your great article
about microloans

01:23:58.492 --> 01:23:59.928
in the
Asian Economics Journal.

01:24:00.015 --> 01:24:02.191
I received so much criticism

01:24:02.278 --> 01:24:04.062
about that article.

01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:06.848
Well, you know what? I think
your critics missed the point.

01:24:06.935 --> 01:24:09.154
'Cause your microloans
helped women,

01:24:09.242 --> 01:24:11.200
and women lift up economies.

01:24:12.767 --> 01:24:15.073
What was your name, again?

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.640
Rachel Chu.

01:24:16.727 --> 01:24:18.338
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:24:18.425 --> 01:24:20.209
Now, what brings you here?

01:24:20.296 --> 01:24:21.906
I followed a boy...

01:24:26.041 --> 01:24:27.434
Ah Mais here.

01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:29.610
She never comes
to these things.

01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:54.896
How are you feeling?

01:24:54.983 --> 01:24:56.376
- Good.
- All right. Don't be nervous.

01:24:56.463 --> 01:24:57.768
- I'm not nervous.
- You look great.

01:24:57.855 --> 01:24:59.553
Thank you.

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.382
Hey, Rachel's not sitting
with your family.

01:25:02.469 --> 01:25:04.297
Yeah. I don't blame her.

01:25:04.384 --> 01:25:07.038
Mother hasn't exactly been
the most welcoming.

01:25:07.125 --> 01:25:10.825
But I'm sure she'll be at
the back somewhere laying low.

01:25:10.912 --> 01:25:14.481
No. She's right at the front.
Take a look.

01:25:22.227 --> 01:25:24.317
I think you've got a fighter.

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:31.498
Guys, it's time.

01:25:32.542 --> 01:25:35.153
- Okay.
- All right.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.938
- Hey.
- Yeah?

01:25:37.025 --> 01:25:38.461
Make sure
she doesn't take your balls.

01:25:40.289 --> 01:25:41.943
Just joking. Just joking.

01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:43.901
Thanks for dressing up,
Bernard.

01:25:43.988 --> 01:25:45.642
Hey. It's not about me.

01:25:45.729 --> 01:25:47.644
Yeah. Come on.
Thanks, Bernard.

01:25:47.731 --> 01:25:49.994
- It's not about me.
- All right.

01:29:24.861 --> 01:29:27.734
You look spectacular,
you know that?

01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:30.606
It's the double Spanx.
I can't breathe.

01:29:30.693 --> 01:29:34.305
It's not the clothes.
It's just you.

01:29:35.698 --> 01:29:37.744
Uh, excuse me.

01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:40.268
This party isn't gonna
dance itself. Come on.

01:29:40.355 --> 01:29:42.531
- Come on, Nicki-Nick.
- All right.

01:29:42.618 --> 01:29:44.359
You're very good.

01:29:44.446 --> 01:29:45.360
- Yeah? I only stepped
on her twice.
Very.

01:30:06.163 --> 01:30:07.382
Oliver.

01:30:07.469 --> 01:30:09.471
Yes, Auntie?

01:30:09.558 --> 01:30:11.168
Be a dear
and take care of that.

01:30:14.389 --> 01:30:17.087
As you wish.

01:30:27.968 --> 01:30:30.797
You know, you should wear
a tux more often.

01:30:32.015 --> 01:30:34.583
Like, all the time?

01:30:34.670 --> 01:30:36.541
Mmm, yeah.

01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:39.632
You know, when you're
playing basketball at the Y,

01:30:39.719 --> 01:30:42.591
shaving, brushing your teeth.

01:30:51.687 --> 01:30:53.994
Alistair, your father's
looking for you.

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:56.866
Something about an overdrawn
discretionary account.

01:30:57.693 --> 01:30:59.521
Oh, my God.

01:30:59.608 --> 01:31:02.002
Baby! Oh, my gosh!

01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.787
Oh. Hi.

01:31:04.874 --> 01:31:07.703
So, how do you like
the wedding?

01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:11.620
Oh, my gosh!
It's so glamorous!

01:31:11.707 --> 01:31:13.796
When it's Alistair's
and my wedding,

01:31:13.883 --> 01:31:16.190
I want it
just like this.

01:31:16.277 --> 01:31:20.455
No, no, no! I want it big!
Big! Better!

01:31:20.542 --> 01:31:22.587
Sweetie!

01:31:22.675 --> 01:31:24.372
You'll be lucky
if Alistair's parents

01:31:24.459 --> 01:31:26.722
give you a tea ceremony.

01:31:26.809 --> 01:31:28.681
You know Alistair's
only the fourth son

01:31:28.768 --> 01:31:30.378
of a penny-pinching family,
don't you?

01:31:30.465 --> 01:31:32.380
I mean, he'll get
next to nothing.

01:31:32.467 --> 01:31:34.034
You want a wedding like this?

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:36.297
You should've fallen in love
with an only child.

01:31:36.384 --> 01:31:37.646
Someone like...

01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:41.258
Bernard Tai.

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.569
Master Nicholas,

01:31:47.656 --> 01:31:48.962
your grandmother would like

01:31:49.049 --> 01:31:50.964
to speak to you
and Miss Rachel.

01:31:53.706 --> 01:31:55.272
Okay.

01:31:56.186 --> 01:31:57.274
Sick party.

01:31:57.361 --> 01:31:58.362
Yeah!

01:32:00.016 --> 01:32:01.104
Hold that.

01:32:13.595 --> 01:32:15.118
Ah Ma, Mum,

01:32:15.205 --> 01:32:16.903
what's all this about?

01:32:31.656 --> 01:32:33.136
Ah Ma!

01:32:33.223 --> 01:32:34.703
I'm sorry to tell you,

01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:36.139
but Rachel has been lying
to us about her family

01:32:36.226 --> 01:32:37.488
and her mother.

01:32:37.575 --> 01:32:38.751
What are... What are you
talking about?

01:32:38.838 --> 01:32:40.448
I hired
a private investigator...

01:32:40.535 --> 01:32:42.276
- Mom, you didn't.
- ...to look into her past.

01:32:42.363 --> 01:32:43.407
She said her father
passed away in China...

01:32:43.494 --> 01:32:44.582
Mum!

01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:46.106
...but that's not true.

01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:48.630
Your mother's husband
is very much alive.

01:32:48.717 --> 01:32:50.806
During her marriage,
she cheated on him

01:32:50.893 --> 01:32:52.982
and became pregnant
with another man's child.

01:32:53.069 --> 01:32:55.680
And before he found out,
she ran away to America.

01:32:55.768 --> 01:32:57.334
- It's all in here.
- You had no right!

01:32:57.421 --> 01:32:58.901
- We had every right!
- You did not!

01:32:58.988 --> 01:33:00.207
You're lying!

01:33:00.294 --> 01:33:01.208
Do you have any idea
the scandal

01:33:01.295 --> 01:33:02.644
this would have caused

01:33:02.731 --> 01:33:04.428
for Rachel to hide
something like this?

01:33:06.996 --> 01:33:08.955
She wouldn't have.

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:12.480
We cannot be linked
to this sort of family.

01:33:17.354 --> 01:33:19.095
I don't want
any part of your family.

01:33:19.182 --> 01:33:20.183
Rachel.

01:33:24.448 --> 01:33:25.580
Let me go!
Rachel.

01:33:25.667 --> 01:33:26.799
Nick!

01:33:47.210 --> 01:33:48.777
Hey, Cinderella.
What's wrong?

01:33:48.864 --> 01:33:51.214
You gotta return your dress
before midnight?

01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:56.350
- Nicki-Nick!
- Oh, you're just in time.

01:34:08.405 --> 01:34:10.146
Oliver.

01:34:10.233 --> 01:34:11.408
- Oh, Nicki, have you...
- Rachel. Have you seen Rachel?

01:34:14.542 --> 01:34:16.022
Nicholas! Hi!

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:17.066
- It's been so long.
- Yes.

01:34:20.896 --> 01:34:23.029
Amanda, no. Amanda, not now!

01:35:06.637 --> 01:35:09.814
Rachel. Come to breakfast.

01:35:11.294 --> 01:35:13.601
You need to eat.

01:35:13.688 --> 01:35:19.041
Or use the bathroom,
or maybe a shower.

01:35:21.914 --> 01:35:23.393
It's there if you need it.

01:35:48.462 --> 01:35:51.726
Here, Rachel.
This is your dinner.

01:35:51.813 --> 01:35:53.206
Thank you.

01:36:13.617 --> 01:36:15.445
I'll stop by
again tonight.

01:36:15.532 --> 01:36:19.014
Rachel, please,
just give me a call.

01:36:20.537 --> 01:36:24.324
Anytime. Please.

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:39.426
Rachel,
someone's here to see ya.

01:36:39.513 --> 01:36:41.558
I don't want
to see him.

01:36:41.645 --> 01:36:42.603
It's not Nick.

01:36:46.259 --> 01:36:47.912
Mom!

01:37:00.490 --> 01:37:03.058
Drink more.

01:37:03.145 --> 01:37:06.322
The dong-quaiand the ginseng
will give you more energy.

01:37:09.238 --> 01:37:11.023
Thanks.

01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:14.939
Your spirit
has always been so strong,

01:37:15.027 --> 01:37:16.158
ever since young.

01:37:16.245 --> 01:37:19.031
You will get through this.

01:37:22.208 --> 01:37:25.124
Why didn't you tell me
about my father?

01:37:35.047 --> 01:37:39.486
My husband wasn't a good man.

01:37:40.922 --> 01:37:42.358
He hurt me.

01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:50.497
But an old schoolmate of mine
helped me through things,

01:37:50.584 --> 01:37:52.586
and we fell in love,

01:37:54.066 --> 01:37:56.677
and I got pregnant
with his baby.

01:37:57.591 --> 01:38:00.028
That's you.

01:38:00.115 --> 01:38:02.596
I was so afraid
my husband would find out

01:38:02.683 --> 01:38:03.988
and kill us both,

01:38:04.076 --> 01:38:07.166
so I just took you
and I ran to America.

01:38:09.559 --> 01:38:11.170
Did you ever...

01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:16.000
I don't know, think about
trying to talk to him?

01:38:16.088 --> 01:38:17.785
I mean,
do you think about him?

01:38:19.743 --> 01:38:20.744
Every day.

01:38:20.831 --> 01:38:22.485
Oh.

01:38:22.572 --> 01:38:24.661
When we first
came to America,

01:38:24.748 --> 01:38:26.620
all I could think about
was reaching out for him,

01:38:26.707 --> 01:38:30.450
but I was so afraid
my husband would find us.

01:38:30.537 --> 01:38:34.410
And now, I just don't want
to cause any trouble.

01:38:34.497 --> 01:38:35.455
Oh...

01:38:39.198 --> 01:38:40.721
I'm really sorry.

01:38:42.505 --> 01:38:44.855
Oh! Don't be sorry.

01:38:47.771 --> 01:38:49.338
You listen to me.

01:38:49.425 --> 01:38:52.385
Everything that happened
in my past life

01:38:52.472 --> 01:38:54.865
is the reason why I got you.

01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:59.174
My brave and clever girl.

01:39:14.798 --> 01:39:16.887
I really thought
he was the one.

01:39:19.238 --> 01:39:21.153
Now, I just want to go home.

01:39:23.503 --> 01:39:27.202
You know, Nick was the one
who called me

01:39:27.289 --> 01:39:30.031
and brought me out here.

01:39:30.118 --> 01:39:34.862
Before we go, I think
you should go and talk to him.

01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:50.486
I'll e-mail the photo later.

01:39:50.573 --> 01:39:52.445
P.T., how long you been
standing there?

01:39:52.532 --> 01:39:53.968
Just a short while.

01:40:32.136 --> 01:40:35.618
I'm so sorry about everything.

01:40:37.229 --> 01:40:39.318
What my mother did to you
is unforgivable.

01:40:39.405 --> 01:40:41.233
- It's not your fault.
- It is.

01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:44.279
Ever since I can remember,

01:40:44.366 --> 01:40:46.107
my family has been
my whole life.

01:40:46.194 --> 01:40:48.805
And I am done
making excuses for them.

01:40:58.598 --> 01:40:59.729
Nick.

01:40:59.816 --> 01:41:01.557
Marry me.

01:41:01.644 --> 01:41:02.863
Marry me, and we'll start

01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:04.386
a new life together
in New York.

01:41:04.473 --> 01:41:06.910
Just you and me.
I'll leave all of this behind.

01:42:21.115 --> 01:42:22.725
Thanks for meeting me here.

01:42:24.858 --> 01:42:26.294
Don't worry about them.

01:42:26.381 --> 01:42:28.470
They're half deaf
and they only speak Hokkien.

01:42:56.672 --> 01:42:58.413
My mom taught me how to play.

01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:00.459
She told me Mahjong
would teach me

01:43:00.546 --> 01:43:03.113
important life skills.

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:07.074
Negotiation,
strategy, cooperation.

01:43:08.989 --> 01:43:13.036
You asked me here. I assume
it's not for a Mahjong lesson.

01:43:15.996 --> 01:43:17.040
Pong.

01:43:21.001 --> 01:43:22.872
My mother taught me, too.

01:43:27.399 --> 01:43:31.185
I know Nick told you the truth
about my mom.

01:43:31.272 --> 01:43:33.666
But you didn't like me
the second I got here.

01:43:34.754 --> 01:43:36.059
Why is that?

01:43:36.146 --> 01:43:38.192
There is a Hokkien phrase.

01:43:39.541 --> 01:43:41.413
It means,
"Our own kind of people."

01:43:43.327 --> 01:43:45.808
And you're not our own kind.

01:43:45.895 --> 01:43:48.115
'Cause I'm not rich?

01:43:48.202 --> 01:43:50.378
'Cause I didn't go to
a British boarding school,

01:43:50.465 --> 01:43:52.902
or I wasn't born
into a wealthy family?

01:43:52.989 --> 01:43:55.209
You're a foreigner. American.

01:43:55.296 --> 01:43:59.648
And all Americans think about
is their own happiness.

01:43:59.735 --> 01:44:01.650
Don't you want
Nick to be happy?

01:44:01.737 --> 01:44:03.870
It's an illusion.

01:44:03.957 --> 01:44:07.439
We understand
how to build things that last.

01:44:07.526 --> 01:44:09.310
Something you know
nothing about.

01:44:12.182 --> 01:44:13.880
You don't know me.

01:44:13.967 --> 01:44:16.360
I know you're not
what Nick needs.

01:44:21.278 --> 01:44:23.063
Well, he proposed
to me yesterday.

01:44:28.721 --> 01:44:30.549
He said he'd walk away
from his family

01:44:30.636 --> 01:44:32.507
and from you for good.

01:44:36.729 --> 01:44:38.426
Don't worry.
I turned him down.

01:44:43.039 --> 01:44:45.085
Only a fool
folds a winning hand.

01:44:45.172 --> 01:44:50.307
There's no winning.
You made sure of that.

01:44:50.394 --> 01:44:53.485
Because if Nick chose me,
he would lose his family.

01:44:56.009 --> 01:44:58.315
And if he chose his family,

01:44:58.402 --> 01:45:01.536
he might spend the rest
of his life resenting you.

01:45:21.774 --> 01:45:24.777
So you chose for him.

01:45:24.864 --> 01:45:27.344
I'm not leaving
'cause I'm scared

01:45:27.431 --> 01:45:29.999
or because I think
I'm not enough.

01:45:30.086 --> 01:45:34.351
Because maybe for the first
time in my life,

01:45:35.352 --> 01:45:36.832
I know I am.

01:45:38.530 --> 01:45:41.750
I just love Nick so much.

01:45:41.837 --> 01:45:44.536
I don't want him
to lose his mom again.

01:45:49.062 --> 01:45:54.197
So I just wanted you
to know that one day,

01:45:54.284 --> 01:45:56.460
when he marries
another lucky girl

01:45:56.548 --> 01:45:58.811
who is enough for you,

01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:02.945
and you're playing
with your grandkids

01:46:03.032 --> 01:46:04.817
while the tan huas
are blooming

01:46:04.904 --> 01:46:07.210
and the birds are chirping,

01:46:08.429 --> 01:46:11.824
that it was because of me.

01:46:11.911 --> 01:46:16.089
A poor,
raised by a single mother,

01:46:16.176 --> 01:46:21.703
low class, immigrant nobody.

01:46:59.436 --> 01:47:01.134
Hey.

01:47:01.221 --> 01:47:03.876
I'm gonna send someone
for the rest of my stuff.

01:47:03.963 --> 01:47:05.355
But I wanna talk to you

01:47:05.442 --> 01:47:06.313
about my visitation rights
with Cassian.

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:07.488
Stop talking.

01:47:08.141 --> 01:47:09.533
What?

01:47:09.621 --> 01:47:11.623
Don't worry
about packing your things.

01:47:11.710 --> 01:47:15.670
You bought this apartment,
you keep it. We're leaving.

01:47:15.757 --> 01:47:16.889
What do you mean
you're leaving?

01:47:16.976 --> 01:47:18.412
Where are you gonna go?

01:47:18.499 --> 01:47:20.806
I have 14 apartment
buildings that I own,

01:47:20.893 --> 01:47:24.374
so probably one of those.

01:47:24.461 --> 01:47:25.811
And you'll see Cassian
when it's good for him,

01:47:25.898 --> 01:47:27.203
not when it's good for you.

01:47:29.597 --> 01:47:30.990
Hey!

01:47:31.077 --> 01:47:32.774
Look, you know,
it's not just my fault

01:47:32.861 --> 01:47:35.211
that things didn't work out.

01:47:35.298 --> 01:47:39.215
You're right. I shouldn't have
kept things from you.

01:47:39.302 --> 01:47:42.044
Hidden my shoes,
turned down jobs,

01:47:42.131 --> 01:47:43.567
charity work,
worrying that it might

01:47:43.655 --> 01:47:45.569
make you feel lesser than.

01:47:45.657 --> 01:47:47.615
But let's be clear.

01:47:47.702 --> 01:47:50.792
The problem with our marriage
isn't my family's money.

01:47:50.879 --> 01:47:54.666
It's that you're a coward.
You gave up on us.

01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:57.669
But I've just realized,

01:47:57.756 --> 01:48:01.368
it's not my job
to make you feel like a man.

01:48:01.455 --> 01:48:04.153
I can't make you
something you're not.

01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:12.335
Good for you!

01:48:12.422 --> 01:48:14.120
Walking away from Nick

01:48:14.207 --> 01:48:18.515
and his family's fat-ass
property portfolio.

01:48:18.602 --> 01:48:23.042
You have no one,
no net worth,

01:48:23.129 --> 01:48:27.176
but you have integrity.
That's why I respect you.

01:48:27.263 --> 01:48:29.004
Thank you for everything.

01:49:04.648 --> 01:49:07.739
- Bye, Mrs. Chu.
- Goodbye and thank you.

01:49:09.523 --> 01:49:11.568
Sure I can't get you to stay?

01:49:11.655 --> 01:49:14.180
You know, my brother P.T.,
he's still single.

01:49:27.541 --> 01:49:29.369
All right.

01:50:07.407 --> 01:50:09.017
Rachel!

01:50:10.366 --> 01:50:14.675
Rachel! Stay there.

01:50:14.762 --> 01:50:18.113
I'm gonna go and look
for some extra blankets.

01:50:20.246 --> 01:50:21.943
Hello.

01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:25.338
Sorry, just one second.
Nick, what are you doing here?

01:50:25.425 --> 01:50:27.427
I'm flying back
to New York with you.

01:50:27.514 --> 01:50:29.951
God, don't make this harder
than it already is.

01:50:30.038 --> 01:50:31.648
I always imagined what me

01:50:31.735 --> 01:50:33.694
proposing to you
would be like.

01:50:33.781 --> 01:50:36.479
You know what?
I had it all planned out.

01:50:36.566 --> 01:50:37.916
Oh!

01:50:38.003 --> 01:50:40.048
I'm right behind you.
Don't mind me.

01:50:40.135 --> 01:50:42.746
I'd bring you to my favorite
spot on the island.

01:50:42.834 --> 01:50:45.271
There's a hidden trail that
I used to go to as a child.

01:50:45.358 --> 01:50:46.707
Now there's a cove there

01:50:46.794 --> 01:50:49.492
that opens up
to this beautiful lake.

01:50:49.579 --> 01:50:51.277
Um... Sorry, dude.

01:50:51.364 --> 01:50:52.887
Give me a second.

01:50:55.542 --> 01:50:59.415
When the sun hits the horizon,
I'd get down on one knee.

01:51:00.982 --> 01:51:03.289
And the rest of the world
would fall away.

01:51:03.376 --> 01:51:04.768
Because it would
just be you...

01:51:06.466 --> 01:51:07.946
Because it's just you...

01:51:08.033 --> 01:51:09.599
Sorry,
I can help you with that.

01:51:09.686 --> 01:51:11.427
All right, it's fine.
Stay there.

01:51:11.514 --> 01:51:14.517
Yay. You, too?
Watch your fingers.

01:51:14.604 --> 01:51:16.171
- Lift it up. Okay.
- Thank you.

01:51:16.258 --> 01:51:18.434
Everybody okay?

01:51:18.521 --> 01:51:21.002
Because I just need 30 seconds
with this woman.

01:51:21.089 --> 01:51:22.874
Okay, thank you.

01:51:22.961 --> 01:51:25.528
Oh. Coming through. Sorry.

01:51:25.615 --> 01:51:28.880
I know this is a far throw
from a hidden paradise.

01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:32.013
But wherever
you are in the world,

01:51:33.493 --> 01:51:34.668
that's where I belong.

01:51:36.539 --> 01:51:37.584
But I...

01:51:43.068 --> 01:51:44.983
Rachel Chu,

01:51:46.854 --> 01:51:48.116
will you marry me?

01:51:51.076 --> 01:51:53.426
And make me the happiest man
in this world?

01:51:53.513 --> 01:51:56.472
Yes! Yes! Yes!
She will marry you!

01:51:57.256 --> 01:51:58.474
Yes!

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:01.564
Oh!

01:52:12.488 --> 01:52:16.318
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:52:16.405 --> 01:52:19.800
This is gonna be
some flight back to New York.

01:52:19.887 --> 01:52:22.846
Well, I was actually thinking
about staying one more night.

01:52:36.077 --> 01:52:38.123
It's all about you, Nick!

01:53:20.904 --> 01:53:23.733
Make babies! Make babies!
