00:48.420 --> 00:50.040
We have a midcourse deviation.

00:50.130 --> 00:53.300
Target heading 036, 126 miles.

00:53.380 --> 00:56.300
Bearing 062, Havana, VOR.

01:01.470 --> 01:03.060
He's landing at Cray Cay.

01:03.140 --> 01:04.769
Advise Key West Drug Enforcement.

01:04.849 --> 01:07.440
Roger, sir. AWACS to Key West.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.520
Key West Drug Enforcement, please come in.

01:09.610 --> 01:12.820
If they hurry, they just might
be able to grab the bastard.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.990
Now, you're sure you've got the ring?

01:25.250 --> 01:26.500
Relax, Felix.

01:33.670 --> 01:35.090
Friends of yours?

01:35.170 --> 01:36.840
My partners at the DEA.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.270
What the hell is going on?

01:52.360 --> 01:54.190
Sanchez is in the Bahamas.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.570
Have you cleared it with Nassau?

01:55.650 --> 01:56.740
We've got the green light.

01:56.820 --> 01:58.900
Let's go! Hey, Felix, Felix!

01:58.990 --> 02:00.450
Haven't you forgotten something?

02:00.530 --> 02:03.450
Oh, James, explain to Della, will you?

02:03.540 --> 02:05.490
No way. I'm coming with you.

02:05.580 --> 02:08.460
Okay, but strictly as an observer.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.330
- Sorry, Sharkey.
- Hey, why me?

02:11.420 --> 02:13.790
Hey, you guys, you can't do this to me!

02:13.880 --> 02:16.050
What will I tell Della?

02:37.530 --> 02:40.280
What did he promise you? His heart?

02:42.950 --> 02:44.620
Give her his heart.

02:45.410 --> 02:46.490
No.

02:46.580 --> 02:49.250
No, Franz. I didn't mean any harm.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.580
It's all right, baby.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.760
We all make mistakes.

03:01.590 --> 03:03.930
Your escapades are getting more creative.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.560
Not a word.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.580
He's still not here.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.370
Can you go around the block again?

03:28.450 --> 03:29.450
What about the guests?

03:29.540 --> 03:31.870
I told you this was a mistake!

03:35.960 --> 03:38.050
James, just in case.

03:59.900 --> 04:01.280
Okay.

04:14.330 --> 04:17.630
I want Sanchez alive! Stay here, James.

04:35.270 --> 04:36.730
- No Sanchez.
- Damn.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.190
Watch out!

05:25.030 --> 05:26.570
Hey, observer!

05:27.070 --> 05:28.950
You're trying to get yourself killed?

05:29.030 --> 05:32.240
If I don't get you back for the
wedding, I'm a dead man for sure!

05:40.210 --> 05:43.670
- You need help?
- No. Take your hands off me.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.420
Just go away.

05:49.090 --> 05:50.180
Sanchez!

05:50.260 --> 05:51.300
Let's go!

06:14.240 --> 06:16.620
Come on! Come on!

06:24.590 --> 06:27.090
He'll be in Cuban airspace in 20 minutes.

06:27.170 --> 06:28.920
He hasn't got away yet.

06:29.010 --> 06:30.930
What the hell are you doing?

06:31.010 --> 06:32.800
Let's go fishing!

07:08.170 --> 07:10.670
Forward. Forward.

07:11.510 --> 07:13.470
Easy. Hold it.

07:14.010 --> 07:15.600
Back up. Back up.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.560
Forward now.

07:24.150 --> 07:25.400
Hold it!

07:33.200 --> 07:35.870
Bring him in. Take the load.

07:46.670 --> 07:48.090
No, please go home. I'm very...

07:48.170 --> 07:49.500
There he is!

07:56.550 --> 07:58.180
Let's go, James!

08:24.120 --> 08:25.670
We made it!

08:35.679 --> 08:37.260
Come along. James!

08:37.720 --> 08:39.299
- Your hat.
- Thank you.

09:02.660 --> 09:06.370
I need, I need, I've got
to hold on to your love.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.090
Ooooh.

09:13.300 --> 09:20.220
Hey, baby, think you need a friend
to stand here by your side?

09:20.300 --> 09:21.760
Yes, you do.

09:21.850 --> 09:23.270
Your side.

09:24.980 --> 09:29.440
Oh, baby, now you can depend on me.

09:29.520 --> 09:33.020
To do things right.

09:33.110 --> 09:34.990
Things right.

09:36.150 --> 09:41.160
Please don't bet that
you'll ever escape me.

09:42.330 --> 09:45.370
Once I get my sights on you.

09:45.830 --> 09:48.750
Got a license to kill.

09:48.830 --> 09:54.840
And you know I'm going
straight for your heart.

09:55.090 --> 10:00.470
Got a license to kill.

10:01.220 --> 10:07.180
Anyone who tries to tear us apart.

10:07.270 --> 10:08.270
Honey.

10:08.350 --> 10:10.060
License to kill.

10:11.400 --> 10:15.280
Say that somebody tries
to make a move on you.

10:17.530 --> 10:21.700
In the blink of an eye,
I will be there too.

10:23.490 --> 10:27.870
And they'd better know why
I'm gonna make them pay.

10:29.960 --> 10:35.380
Till their dying day Till their dying day.

10:36.380 --> 10:41.800
Till their dying day.

10:44.890 --> 10:47.560
Got a license to kill.

10:48.180 --> 10:54.810
And you know I'm going
straight for your heart, baby.

10:54.900 --> 10:59.940
Got a license to kill.

11:00.530 --> 11:05.700
Anyone who tries to tear us apart.

11:06.740 --> 11:09.340
License to kill.

11:21.590 --> 11:24.180
Gotta hold onto your loving.

11:25.510 --> 11:29.430
License to kill.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.610
Kill.

11:37.070 --> 11:38.610
On the double!

11:39.940 --> 11:41.990
Get away from the door!

11:42.700 --> 11:46.280
You're facing 139 felony counts, Sanchez.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.620
Why, that's 936 years.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.790
Even one of your famous million-dollar
bribes can't get you out of this one.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.090
Two.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.300
What?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.840
$2 million, U.S.

12:03.470 --> 12:06.300
A standing offer for anyone who springs me.

12:07.350 --> 12:08.680
God damn it!

12:08.760 --> 12:11.390
You think you're in some banana republic?

12:11.480 --> 12:14.480
All that scumbag money won't
do you a bit of good here.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.850
Very good.

12:15.940 --> 12:17.480
But I think I'm gonna be home soon, huh?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.070
Why you...

12:19.150 --> 12:21.190
Get a hold of yourself!

12:23.610 --> 12:26.910
We got a nice private cell waiting
for your ass at Quantico,

12:26.990 --> 12:29.530
and I'm going to personally
see you get there.

12:32.620 --> 12:34.500
I'm terribly sorry!

12:36.380 --> 12:39.960
That's a custom. You see, the bride
always gets to kiss her best man.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.590
I thought it was the other way around.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.300
Oh, James, would you mind?

12:47.390 --> 12:50.760
Felix is still in the study, and
we've got to cut this cake.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.930
I'll do anything for a woman with a knife.

12:53.020 --> 12:55.440
Thank you. Yes, could you help me here?

13:05.700 --> 13:07.780
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. Come in. We're finished.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.030
Pam, meet James.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.450
Goodbye, Felix.

13:14.540 --> 13:16.250
Strictly business, my friend.

13:16.330 --> 13:17.750
Switch that thing off, Felix.

13:17.830 --> 13:19.670
You know you have a house
full of guests waiting.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.960
Just let me save this. Take a seat.

13:22.050 --> 13:25.550
The department wants a
full report, yesterday.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.380
We really hit it lucky today.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.970
Sanchez hasn't been out of
his home base for years.

13:30.050 --> 13:31.050
Well, couldn't you extradite him?

13:31.140 --> 13:32.140
Not a chance.

13:32.220 --> 13:33.810
He's killed, intimidated or bribed

13:33.890 --> 13:36.390
half the government officials
from here to Chile.

13:36.480 --> 13:39.600
There's only one law down
there, Sanchez's law.

13:41.730 --> 13:43.110
Lead or silver.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.570
Ed.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.610
Double congratulations, old buddy.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.780
You take your time on the honeymoon.
Everything's okay.

13:51.870 --> 13:55.450
You must be Bond, the guy who
came along for the ride.

13:55.540 --> 13:56.960
Ed Killifer.

13:57.620 --> 14:00.750
We're taking Sanchez to
Quantico this afternoon.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.500
Hey, stay and have a drink with us.

14:02.590 --> 14:03.630
Can't. Got to get back.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.090
I just came by to kiss the bride.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.680
Felix, it's time to cut the cake.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.890
Hand me the picture of Della. Quick.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.100
She must be ready to kill me.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.650
I tied them myself.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.530
- What are these?
- Lures!

14:28.610 --> 14:30.530
These'll keep you busy
for the next few days.

14:30.610 --> 14:33.620
I'm not going fishing on my honeymoon!

14:35.950 --> 14:37.910
How many others are being held in there?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.540
Where are you taking him, Mr. Killifer?

14:39.620 --> 14:41.170
Now, why did you go to the Bahamas?

14:41.790 --> 14:45.170
Mr. Sanchez, will you look this
way for a picture, please?

14:45.250 --> 14:47.670
Come on, get him inside!

14:49.340 --> 14:50.840
Are you really a Colombian?

14:50.930 --> 14:52.390
Have you been fairly treated?

14:52.470 --> 14:54.050
One more picture, please!

14:54.140 --> 14:56.390
Are you connected with any
laboratories in South America?

14:56.470 --> 14:57.640
Why did you go to the Bahamas?

14:57.730 --> 14:58.980
No more questions.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.390
Do you expect to be
vindicated, Mr. Sanchez?

15:01.480 --> 15:02.980
Wait a minute!

15:05.610 --> 15:07.070
Okay, let's go.

15:07.150 --> 15:08.480
Yeah, we're moving out.

15:28.170 --> 15:30.590
Will you excuse me, Liala? Just a minute.

15:30.670 --> 15:32.220
- I have a surprise for you.
- Oh, really.

15:32.300 --> 15:35.010
Yes, I do. It's right over here.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.100
What's that?

15:45.310 --> 15:48.230
James. Love always, Della and Felix.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.730
We love you.

15:50.690 --> 15:51.990
Thanks.

16:27.610 --> 16:28.820
Come on!

16:56.510 --> 16:57.720
Did you get him?

16:57.800 --> 16:58.850
Hang on.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.010
I can't see him.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.260
How deep is it there?

17:01.350 --> 17:03.060
How many were inside?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.640
Oh, James!

17:41.720 --> 17:44.060
I wanted you to have something.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.930
You know the tradition?

17:46.020 --> 17:49.440
The next one who catches
this is the next one who...

17:49.770 --> 17:50.940
No.

17:51.650 --> 17:53.690
No. Thanks, Della.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.490
It's time I left.

17:55.990 --> 17:57.400
Oh, James.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.370
Did I say something wrong?

18:07.460 --> 18:10.830
He was married once, but
it was a long time ago.

18:17.720 --> 18:21.220
Felix, you're no good to
me with a wrecked back.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.730
Let her go. I'm the one you want.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.910
Hey! Ready to go?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.960
We got the batteries recharged on the sub.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.290
It'll take you to the 12-mile limit.

18:52.380 --> 18:55.340
Fast boat to Cuba, you'll
be there for breakfast.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.090
Relax. We'll wait for Dario.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.920
Look, are you crazy?

18:59.010 --> 19:01.180
You got everybody looking for you.

19:01.260 --> 19:02.720
What about Killifer?

19:02.800 --> 19:04.930
Having a cop here is nuts!

19:06.010 --> 19:07.930
I want to deep-six him.

19:09.100 --> 19:12.310
I made a deal with this guy,
and I'm going to keep my word.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.270
I don't like it. He can finger me.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.900
I spent a fortune on this cover.

19:19.610 --> 19:22.660
Something you'd better understand, amigo,

19:23.910 --> 19:26.990
loyalty is more important to me than money.

19:27.870 --> 19:29.790
Now, get the cop.

19:32.370 --> 19:33.750
Killifer.

19:39.050 --> 19:41.630
There's $2 million, all in twenties.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.010
It's very heavy, but difficult to trace.

19:44.090 --> 19:45.140
Smart.

19:45.220 --> 19:46.550
Be ready for tomorrow.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.100
I have someone to pick you up.

19:48.180 --> 19:50.640
- Where's Lupe?
- On the boat.

19:50.730 --> 19:53.350
Keep her there until I send for her.

19:56.270 --> 19:58.860
Hey, no fooling around with my girl.

19:59.610 --> 20:00.570
You kidding?

20:00.650 --> 20:02.780
After what you did to
that guy on the islands?

20:02.860 --> 20:05.030
You liked my little valentine, huh?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.350
Where's my wife?

20:35.440 --> 20:39.940
Don't worry. We gave her a nice honeymoon.

20:48.530 --> 20:51.660
I want you to know this
is nothing personal.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.330
It's purely

20:53.910 --> 20:55.210
business.

21:20.860 --> 21:21.940
Killifer!

21:22.030 --> 21:25.900
Sorry, old buddy, but two mil
is a hell of a chunk of dough.

21:31.740 --> 21:34.750
Killing me won't stop anything, Sanchez!

21:35.250 --> 21:37.790
There are worse things than dying, hombre.

21:45.380 --> 21:47.010
See you in hell!

21:48.050 --> 21:49.140
No.

21:49.220 --> 21:52.350
Today's the first day of
the rest of your life.

21:54.390 --> 21:55.980
No!

22:30.680 --> 22:31.840
Thank you.

22:34.010 --> 22:35.720
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

22:37.430 --> 22:38.890
Thank you.

22:38.980 --> 22:40.850
Your passport, please?

22:43.940 --> 22:45.150
What's going on?

22:45.230 --> 22:47.860
Some big drug dealer just escaped.

22:48.950 --> 22:52.200
Now, will that be smoking
or non-smoking, Mr...

22:52.280 --> 22:53.320
Your ticket!

23:21.270 --> 23:22.480
Felix?

23:36.870 --> 23:37.990
Della!

24:39.720 --> 24:40.810
Della?

24:40.890 --> 24:42.060
Felix.

24:42.140 --> 24:44.140
You'll be all right. Hang on.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.480
Hey, Leiter. Where you been?

24:49.570 --> 24:52.530
It's Bond. Get an ambulance here, quick!

25:01.830 --> 25:03.290
Hi, Sharkey.

25:03.830 --> 25:05.000
You stick around.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.790
I might have some more
questions for you, okay?

25:07.880 --> 25:09.290
How is he?

25:10.300 --> 25:12.340
His left leg's gone below the knee.

25:12.420 --> 25:14.340
They might be able to save his arm.

25:14.420 --> 25:16.220
You can bet it was a chain saw.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.680
Colombians love to use them on informers.

25:18.760 --> 25:22.180
Hell, they sell more here
than in the state of Oregon.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.770
I wish I could be more hopeful,

25:24.850 --> 25:26.810
but we'll have to wait and see.

25:28.520 --> 25:30.650
Chain saw, my ass!

25:30.730 --> 25:32.940
I know a shark bite when I see one.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.240
Sanchez has vanished.

25:42.330 --> 25:43.870
He's got all of Leiter's files.

25:43.950 --> 25:45.370
God only knows what's in them.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.830
Well, find him.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.500
He's out of our jurisdiction.

25:48.580 --> 25:51.170
I mean, there's plenty of
countries that will protect him.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.800
We can't even get an extradition.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.880
There are other ways.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.880
Let it go, Commander.

25:56.970 --> 25:58.010
You're going to do nothing?

25:58.090 --> 25:59.180
You're just going to forget all about it?

25:59.260 --> 26:01.390
No, I'm not gonna forget about it!

26:02.390 --> 26:06.140
Looks like Sanchez's law operates
north of the border, too.

26:06.730 --> 26:08.640
Let's go shark hunting.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.740
This is the last place in the Keys.

26:17.820 --> 26:20.110
We'll have to try Miami next.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.660
Stay here.

26:34.380 --> 26:37.340
You stay out of sight. I'll handle this.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.140
We're closed. Ain't nobody here.

26:47.230 --> 26:50.390
Look, I've come all the way
from London to see you.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.600
Universal Exports.

26:51.690 --> 26:53.360
We've been retained by
the Regent's Park Zoo

26:53.440 --> 26:56.320
to arrange shipment of a
Carcharodon carcharias.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.440
A what?

26:57.530 --> 26:58.490
Great white shark.

26:58.570 --> 27:01.450
It's all right, Bill. Let him in.

27:01.530 --> 27:04.950
Unfortunately, we sold all
our sharks years ago.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.620
As you can see, we do purely research now.

27:07.700 --> 27:09.660
It's a project to feed the third world.

27:09.750 --> 27:12.500
We feed maggots to our special breed

27:12.580 --> 27:14.710
of genetically engineered fish,

27:14.790 --> 27:18.420
use hormones to make them all
male, gain weight faster.

27:24.140 --> 27:26.930
From your shark-hunting days?

27:27.020 --> 27:29.350
Yeah. Actually, it's for sale.

27:29.430 --> 27:32.650
Look, I'm kind of busy.
Maybe some other time.

27:36.900 --> 27:40.110
Thank you. I look forward
to seeing you again.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.070
Goodbye, Mr...

27:42.160 --> 27:43.410
Goodbye.

28:16.270 --> 28:18.190
Mr. Krest said to be ready.

28:18.270 --> 28:20.730
He'll send the sub back in
three hours to pick you up.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.360
Can't wait.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.700
This dump gives me the creeps.

28:36.380 --> 28:37.750
James.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.920
Hold it, right there.

30:13.810 --> 30:16.310
Do you mind if I get my hands out of here?

30:16.390 --> 30:18.270
Yeah. Do it slowly.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.970
Freeze!

31:40.180 --> 31:42.310
Over by the trapdoor, old buddy.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.740
Is this where you put your old buddy Felix?

31:52.820 --> 31:54.160
Not me.

31:54.660 --> 31:57.370
Chalk that one up to Sanchez and Krest.

32:22.390 --> 32:24.980
There's $2 million in that suitcase.

32:26.190 --> 32:28.190
I'll split it with you.

32:35.700 --> 32:37.240
You earned it.

32:37.870 --> 32:40.370
You keep it, old buddy.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.340
God, what a terrible waste.

32:58.930 --> 33:00.220
Of money.

33:05.810 --> 33:07.230
Hey, Sharkey!

33:09.230 --> 33:10.480
Any news on the Wavekrest?

33:10.570 --> 33:14.570
Yeah. She's a big marine research
vessel owned by a Milton Krest.

33:15.450 --> 33:18.870
They're collecting specimens
off the Cay Sal Bank.

33:18.950 --> 33:20.990
How long will it take us to get there?

33:21.080 --> 33:23.080
Maybe about six hours.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.960
I have a few things to pick up.
Be ready in an hour.

33:26.040 --> 33:27.500
Yeah, okay.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.760
Hey, Commander, you got a minute?

33:35.930 --> 33:38.840
Local cops got a tip about
a warehouse last night.

33:38.930 --> 33:42.970
Turned up 500 keys of Colombian
pure, a couple of stiffs,

33:43.060 --> 33:46.230
and a little bitty piece of
what used to be Killifer.

33:46.310 --> 33:49.190
Good. At least someone's on the case.

33:49.270 --> 33:52.900
You may be a pal of Leiter's, but
I can only cover up so much.

33:52.980 --> 33:55.400
The D.A. Is screaming
to know what happened.

33:55.490 --> 33:58.410
You know, we got laws in this country, too.

33:59.410 --> 34:02.830
Do you have a law against
what they did to Leiter?

34:06.660 --> 34:09.330
Look, you're in over your head.

34:09.420 --> 34:11.460
This is where it ends, Commander.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.250
You were supposed to be
in Istanbul last night.

34:51.330 --> 34:54.250
I'm afraid this unfortunate Leiter business

34:54.340 --> 34:55.710
has clouded your judgment.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.050
You have a job to do.

34:57.130 --> 34:59.470
I expect you on a plane this afternoon.

34:59.550 --> 35:00.880
I haven't finished here, sir.

35:00.970 --> 35:02.640
Leave it to the Americans.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.470
It's their mess. Let them clear it up.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.930
Sir, they're not going to do anything.

35:07.020 --> 35:09.520
Look, I owe it to Leiter.

35:10.230 --> 35:12.020
He's put his life on the
line for me many times.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.610
Spare me this sentimental rubbish.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.690
He knew the risks.

35:17.650 --> 35:18.990
And his wife?

35:19.070 --> 35:22.280
This private vendetta of yours
could easily compromise.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.200
Her Majesty's government.

35:24.280 --> 35:27.580
You have an assignment, and I
expect you to carry it out

35:27.660 --> 35:30.040
objectively and professionally.

35:31.870 --> 35:34.250
Then you have my resignation, sir.

35:34.340 --> 35:37.000
We're not a country club, 007.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.760
Effective immediately,

35:42.840 --> 35:45.180
your license to kill is revoked,

35:45.260 --> 35:48.310
and I require you to hand over your weapon.

35:49.430 --> 35:50.640
Now.

35:53.400 --> 35:57.650
I need hardly remind you that you're
still bound by the Official Secrets Act.

35:59.650 --> 36:01.900
Well, then I guess it's

36:03.200 --> 36:04.910
a farewell to arms.

36:14.670 --> 36:15.790
Don't! Too many people.

36:22.380 --> 36:23.930
God help you, Commander.

36:43.150 --> 36:45.030
Something in sector C.

36:57.130 --> 37:00.420
You caused us all a lot
of trouble, young lady.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.840
You're borracho. Go to bed.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.340
When Sanchez heard you ran away,

37:06.800 --> 37:08.760
he went nuts.

37:08.850 --> 37:11.060
It's none of your business.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.350
It's my business when
your stupid little tricks

37:13.430 --> 37:15.480
get Sanchez arrested,

37:16.520 --> 37:20.070
and I gotta put my organization
at risk to get him out.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.730
The DEA just raided Key West.

37:23.650 --> 37:25.900
You cost me a lot of dough.

37:25.990 --> 37:27.530
He'll give you the money.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.740
He doesn't work that way.

37:31.830 --> 37:34.000
You better watch yourself, girlie.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.080
I've known him a long time.

37:36.170 --> 37:39.630
I've seen a lot of girls
like you come and go.

37:39.710 --> 37:41.800
You're drunk. Get out.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.470
And stop peeking through my windows.

37:45.550 --> 37:48.890
Hey, come on, come on, what
are you so stuck-up for?

37:48.970 --> 37:52.140
He fixed that phony beauty contest you won.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.020
Hey. Mr. Krest?

37:55.980 --> 37:57.140
Yeah, what?

37:57.230 --> 37:59.850
The Sentinel's picking up something
large on the monitor, sir.

37:59.940 --> 38:02.360
I think you'd better take a look.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.400
I don't believe this.

38:13.580 --> 38:15.700
What the hell is it now?

38:19.380 --> 38:22.420
It's just a manta ray.
Get the probe back in.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.300
We'll start loading now.

38:24.380 --> 38:25.380
Yes, sir.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.990
He said you're okay.

40:53.860 --> 40:55.610
Take care of him.

41:14.220 --> 41:16.840
Make a sound and you're dead.

41:20.260 --> 41:21.640
You.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.640
What are you doing in here?

41:23.730 --> 41:25.520
Krest gave me his cabin.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.310
He's next door. Where's Sanchez?

41:28.400 --> 41:29.980
He's not onboard.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.650
I don't know where he is.

41:31.730 --> 41:33.150
You're his girlfriend.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.820
He doesn't tell me anything.

41:37.910 --> 41:40.330
Open it. I need to talk to you.

41:41.830 --> 41:43.240
Answer it.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.710
Just a moment.

41:48.750 --> 41:50.750
- What do you want?
- Somebody slipped aboard.

41:50.840 --> 41:53.380
Did you see anybody?

41:54.420 --> 41:56.420
No, I was sleeping. Go away.

41:56.510 --> 41:58.510
Mr. Krest. They're back.

41:59.430 --> 42:01.010
Bolt your door.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.850
Who whipped you? Sanchez?

42:09.150 --> 42:11.150
It was my fault.

42:11.230 --> 42:13.530
I did something wrong, made him angry.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.200
Nice work, Clive.

42:25.290 --> 42:29.370
Thanks, Mr. Krest. Guess what?
His name was Sharkey.

42:31.290 --> 42:34.170
Get rid of the boat. We've got work to do.

42:36.260 --> 42:38.510
You'd better find yourself a new lover.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.800
Don't you men know any other way?

42:40.890 --> 42:43.850
It's Sanchez's way. You seem to like it.

42:43.930 --> 42:45.810
You know nothing.

42:45.890 --> 42:46.930
Please go.

42:47.020 --> 42:49.100
If they find you here,
we'll both be killed.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.770
Stay here.

42:56.610 --> 42:58.650
We got everything useful out of her.

42:58.740 --> 43:00.780
That's it. Take her out and sink her.

43:00.860 --> 43:02.950
Okay, Clive. Cast off!

43:06.290 --> 43:08.330
Compliments of Sharkey.

43:12.330 --> 43:14.090
Man overboard!

43:24.350 --> 43:26.850
Get him! Don't let him get away!

43:28.520 --> 43:29.520
What's wrong?

43:29.600 --> 43:31.390
Get back in your cabin and stay there.

43:31.810 --> 43:33.440
The guy must have drowned, Mr. Krest.

43:33.520 --> 43:36.150
Don't be so sure. Find him!

43:40.490 --> 43:42.200
Come on!

43:45.990 --> 43:47.120
Launch Sentinel!

43:47.200 --> 43:48.370
Yes, sir!

44:04.050 --> 44:06.680
Stand by to dive when I tell you.

44:18.110 --> 44:20.360
Numbers one and two, dive!

44:36.500 --> 44:39.340
I can see something reflecting over there!

44:45.640 --> 44:48.470
There's too much turbulence to be sure.

45:02.900 --> 45:04.360
Wavekrest! Wavekrest!

45:07.120 --> 45:08.490
Loading completed, Mr. Krest.

45:08.580 --> 45:09.780
Bring Sentinel back in.

45:09.910 --> 45:11.120
Yes, sir.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.290
Mr. Krest!

46:03.670 --> 46:05.550
Bring Sentinel up!

46:06.930 --> 46:10.220
There he is! There! Right there! Get him!

46:10.300 --> 46:11.510
There!

46:15.140 --> 46:17.270
Dive, damn it! Dive!

46:17.350 --> 46:18.770
Right there!

49:13.860 --> 49:15.700
There! Pick him up!

49:22.660 --> 49:24.500
All boats return to Wavekrest!

49:24.580 --> 49:26.210
Aye, aye, sir.

51:03.470 --> 51:05.390
Here. Put her stern-in.

51:19.200 --> 51:22.030
Hey, do you know someone called Bouvier?

51:22.660 --> 51:24.120
Over there.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.460
Well, this is an unexpected pleasure.

51:29.540 --> 51:30.790
Where's Leiter?

51:30.870 --> 51:32.460
Hospital, intensive care.

51:32.540 --> 51:35.380
Where you'll be if you don't
get out of here fast.

51:35.460 --> 51:37.250
Sanchez has Leiter's files.

51:37.340 --> 51:39.050
Your name's all over them.

51:40.470 --> 51:42.890
Hell, I knew something was wrong.

51:43.470 --> 51:45.100
Those two have been at the bar for hours.

51:45.180 --> 51:47.390
Probably waiting to see
who showed up to meet me.

51:47.470 --> 51:49.060
Would you like anything to drink?

51:49.140 --> 51:50.850
Bud with a lime. Yeah, same.

51:50.940 --> 51:52.650
Sure thing, hon.

51:55.440 --> 51:59.070
Shit! It's Dario. He's bad news.

52:00.110 --> 52:02.660
He used to be with the Contras
before they kicked him out.

52:02.740 --> 52:05.530
Just the kind of guy Sanchez would send.

52:06.870 --> 52:08.490
You carrying?

52:12.290 --> 52:16.210
If they start shooting, you just
hit the deck and stay there.

52:27.930 --> 52:33.270
La senorita Bouvier.Don't I
know you from somewhere?

52:33.730 --> 52:36.360
- No.
- Oh, yes, I do.

52:36.440 --> 52:40.030
You used to fly charter planes
for some friends of mine.

52:40.900 --> 52:42.900
I got a job for you.

52:42.990 --> 52:44.660
Why don't we go outside,
and we talk in private.

52:44.740 --> 52:47.450
Take your hands off her. She's with me.

52:47.530 --> 52:49.370
Nobody's asking you, gringo.

52:49.450 --> 52:52.410
He's with me. Keep your hands on the table.

52:55.710 --> 52:57.170
Here we go.

52:58.300 --> 53:00.920
Two beers. That'll be $3.50.

53:01.340 --> 53:03.340
Do your friends want something?

53:03.430 --> 53:05.090
Let me get it!

53:09.350 --> 53:11.520
He's had enough. Run a tab.

53:11.600 --> 53:13.020
Okay.

53:13.100 --> 53:14.480
- How did you get here?
- By boat.

53:14.560 --> 53:17.190
- Where is it?
- Back behind this wall.

53:25.700 --> 53:26.950
Thanks.

54:09.490 --> 54:10.660
Touche.

54:26.170 --> 54:27.800
Get it started.

54:43.940 --> 54:45.280
Come on!

55:13.560 --> 55:14.640
Don't move.

55:14.720 --> 55:17.850
Relax. It's a bulletproof vest.

55:18.390 --> 55:20.310
This Kevlar's great.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.730
You're bloody lucky to be alive!

55:22.810 --> 55:26.030
It's not luck. It's experience.

55:26.110 --> 55:28.320
A few inches higher, it'd
have been your head.

55:28.400 --> 55:30.320
Look, I just saved your life back there.

55:30.410 --> 55:31.570
If it wasn't for me,

55:31.660 --> 55:33.370
your ass would've been nailed to the wall.

55:33.450 --> 55:34.660
You saved my life?

55:34.740 --> 55:36.200
Yes.

55:36.290 --> 55:38.660
It's a tough business you've
picked, Miss Bouvier.

55:38.750 --> 55:40.080
Leave it to the professionals.

55:40.170 --> 55:42.500
Look, pal, I was an army pilot.

55:42.580 --> 55:45.340
I have flown to the toughest
hellholes in South America,

55:45.420 --> 55:49.090
and I will not have you lecture
me about professionalism.

55:58.020 --> 55:59.520
Out of gas.

55:59.600 --> 56:02.390
I haven't heard that one in a long time.

56:03.270 --> 56:05.810
Well, they must have hit the fuel line.

56:05.900 --> 56:08.320
Look, I'm gonna need your help.

56:08.400 --> 56:11.610
I want a complete rundown
on Sanchez's operation,

56:12.030 --> 56:15.200
and I'll need a flight to
Isthmus City, private.

56:15.280 --> 56:16.950
No one must know I've left.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.580
What do you want to go there for?

56:19.660 --> 56:21.540
I'll pay you very well.

56:21.620 --> 56:24.380
You're going after Sanchez, aren't you?

56:25.630 --> 56:27.130
Will you help me?

56:27.250 --> 56:28.750
How many men have you got?

56:32.340 --> 56:34.130
Just you and me.

56:35.890 --> 56:36.930
Are you crazy?

56:37.010 --> 56:39.140
Sanchez has an entire army
protecting him down there.

56:39.220 --> 56:41.850
Just fly me in and leave. $50,000.

56:41.940 --> 56:43.350
It's not that easy.

56:43.440 --> 56:45.480
False flight plans, payoffs
at Isthmus City Airport.

56:45.560 --> 56:47.400
I can't do a job like
that for less than 100.

56:47.480 --> 56:48.730
Sixty.

56:51.190 --> 56:52.900
- Ninety.
- Seventy.

56:53.910 --> 56:55.990
- Eighty.
- Seventy-five.

56:57.580 --> 56:59.200
You pay the fuel?

56:59.290 --> 57:00.830
You get the plane.

57:04.580 --> 57:05.790
Deal.

57:16.510 --> 57:18.930
Now, why don't you wait until you're asked?

57:19.010 --> 57:21.220
Well, why don't you ask me?

57:55.300 --> 57:57.800
There are five typing errors
on the first page alone.

57:57.890 --> 57:59.140
What's got into you?

57:59.220 --> 58:00.470
Sorry, sir.

58:03.730 --> 58:06.440
"U.S. Immigration has no reports of 007"

58:06.520 --> 58:10.360
"leaving the United States
as of 1500 hours today."

58:11.820 --> 58:13.440
Who authorized this?

58:13.530 --> 58:14.740
I did, sir.

58:15.320 --> 58:17.530
I thought you'd be worried about James.
He's gone missing.

58:17.610 --> 58:21.160
You know him better than that.
He'll go after Sanchez.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.830
He's got to be stopped.

58:23.910 --> 58:26.710
I've already alerted our man in Isthmus.

58:27.080 --> 58:28.330
I want that out by this afternoon.

58:28.420 --> 58:30.170
Yes, sir.

58:32.920 --> 58:33.960
Q Branch, please.

58:57.360 --> 58:59.400
This is the master bedroom.

58:59.490 --> 59:01.320
I hope everything is satisfactory, senor.

59:01.410 --> 59:03.030
It's adequate.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.990
I'd like a case of
champagne, Bollinger R. D.

59:06.080 --> 59:07.330
Certainly, senor.

59:07.410 --> 59:09.370
If I could ask you to sign
the registration cards?

59:09.460 --> 59:13.540
No. My executive secretary, Miss
Kennedy, will take care of that.

59:13.630 --> 59:15.210
Miss Kennedy...

59:16.340 --> 59:18.090
Right here, please.

59:30.650 --> 59:32.940
Fresh flowers every day.

59:33.020 --> 59:34.730
Thank you very much.

59:34.820 --> 59:37.320
Your key. Enjoy your stay.

59:41.360 --> 59:42.570
It's Ms. Kennedy,

59:42.660 --> 59:45.160
and why can't you be my
executive secretary?

59:46.950 --> 59:50.040
We're south of the border.
It's a man's world.

59:51.830 --> 59:54.460
Thanks for everything. Your job's finished.

59:54.540 --> 59:57.050
- I want to stay.
- Too dangerous.

59:57.130 --> 59:58.420
Enough people have been killed already.

59:58.510 --> 01:00:00.380
Don't talk to me about danger.

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:02.880
I won't be safe until Sanchez is dead.

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:05.350
Besides, you could use my help.

01:00:08.850 --> 01:00:10.770
Well, if you're going to stay
and be my executive secretary,

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.890
you'd better look the part.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.770
Here. Buy yourself some decent clothes.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.450
What bank does Sanchez use?
I need to make a deposit.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.320
The biggest one in town, Banco de Isthmus.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:25.870
He owns it.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.680
Senor Bond.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.850
I've come to make a small deposit.

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:52.680
Well, I'm sure my people
downstairs are quite capable of...

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.560
Please sit down.

01:00:56.230 --> 01:01:00.440
We operate the world's largest
private investment fund.

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:03.990
Our biggest problem is what
to do with all the money.

01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:08.450
We have a cash surplus
of $10 million a day,

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:10.410
which we ship, through our bank,

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.910
to the U.S. Federal Reserve,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.870
thus establishing credits

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.790
which can be used for any
legitimate investment.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.510
See, someone has to help the
gringos with their trade deficit.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:27.550
Make out a deposit receipt for
$4,900,000 for senor Bond.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:31.430
And of course there will be additional
monthly deposits in the same amount.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.640
Of course. Be assured,
we at Banco de Isthmus

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:35.690
are experienced in handling
accounts of this nature.

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:37.310
Let me pass, please.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.190
- Senor Montelongo.
- Yes?

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.650
I'm Ms. Kennedy,

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:47.160
Mr. Bond's executive secretary.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.570
I'd also appreciate it
if you could establish

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.830
a line of credit for me at the casino.

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:53.410
Shall we say $2 million?

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.540
No problem.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.040
You have excellent collateral,

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.460
and our chairman also owns the casino.

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.380
Oh, a very convenient arrangement.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:03.210
We have always thought so, senorita.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.720
Thank you. Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen, and welcome.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.760
This is a very special night for us.

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:15.100
We want you to know that only through
your very generous donations

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.440
can the work here at the
OMI continue to progress.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.650
We've learned so much, but we've
only just scratched the surface.

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:23.730
We need your help.

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:27.360
We need you to go to your phones
right now and make a pledge.

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:29.160
This is not for me.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.950
This is not for them. It's for all of us.

01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:32.410
You okay, reinita?

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:33.870
I'm fine.

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.950
Krest called me from the boat

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.040
with a story about
somebody ripping him off.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.420
Did you see anything happen
when you were there?

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.880
No, Franz. I stayed in my
cabin most of the time.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.550
We need your help.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.470
What's the matter, baby, huh?

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:51.140
You know I can't stand that thing.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.940
I'd like a private table. Blacklack.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.690
Certainly, senor Bond.

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:05.030
Would you come this way, please?

01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:14.700
Quarter of a million dollars,

01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:18.040
and I'd like to raise the
limit to $5,000 a box.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.620
Put these wonderful
volunteers behind me to work.

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.960
Dario will take you shopping tomorrow.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.000
You can spend a lot of money, have fun.

01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:28.300
Now, give me a little kiss.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.510
Want one, too?

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.810
We can raise the price.

01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:38.310
$22,000 per kilo this month.

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:39.810
I like that.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.020
Yeah, this is Truman-Lodge.

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.400
$22,000.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.030
Our goal today is to raise...

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.860
$22,000 from each of our
meditation chapters.

01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:54.910
That's $22,000 each.

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:58.200
Go to your phones. Please help us.

01:03:58.870 --> 01:04:00.250
Bless your hearts.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.960
Let me have half a million.

01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:11.840
Listen to this. Our
wonderful Manhattan chapel

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:14.140
has just made a special $500 pledge.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:18.470
Five hundred kilos. I
knew they'd go for it.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.560
This guy cracks me up.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.270
Is senor Sanchez there?

01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:24.230
Yes, he's right here.

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:28.650
Yeah? I got a British sucker

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.280
who dropped a quarter of a million,

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.150
and he wants to play no-limit.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.280
Which one?

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.620
Table two. Plays like a real jerk-off.

01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:40.660
That's the guy that flew in
in the private plane today,

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:43.040
opened that account at the bank.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.540
$5 million in cash.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.010
Let him play.

01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:58.430
Double down.

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:01.680
Split.

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:26.790
Listen to this.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.800
Our Chicago chapel has just
received a $1,000 double pledge.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.720
They all accepted the new price.

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.510
- Senor Sanchez.
- Yes, he's right here.

01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:42.720
Bless your hearts.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.270
The British guy is a quarter-million ahead.

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:48.520
Shall I close the table?

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:51.940
No.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.450
Tell Lupe to come in here.

01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:58.620
Right.

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:05.290
You have good luck tonight.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.920
You gonna share any of that money?

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.800
Miss Kennedy, would you get me
a medium-dry vodka martini?

01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:23.430
- Well, why don't you ask...
- Shaken, not stirred.

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:26.560
Cut?

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.490
You're very professional.

01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:40.200
Used to work here.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.200
Am I going to win or lose?

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.740
Lose, but not much.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.620
Vodka martini, que?

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:52.000
Shaken, not stirred.

01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:56.210
Looks like your luck has changed.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.510
Is that why he sent you?

01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:00.930
And to find out more about you.

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:03.350
Perhaps I'd better quit for the night.

01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:08.850
You should walk straight out of here,

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:11.230
go to the airport and never come back.

01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:19.740
Where's Sanchez?

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.820
Upstairs in his office.

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:22.990
He's been there all day.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.700
He's planning a big party for
some Orientals tomorrow night.

01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:29.370
And what did you tell him
about the Wavekrest?

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.080
Nothing. Now go.

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:36.880
Take me to him.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.010
You loco? You'll get us both killed.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.330
This way, please.

01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:14.630
Send us a dollar. Send us 50 cents.

01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:16.630
Send whatever you can send.

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:20.090
We've got a very special
offer for you guys out there

01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:21.380
with your beer and your popcorn...

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.300
This is almost over.

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:30.520
This particular book has sold in excess
of a quarter of a million copies.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.479
Anyone who sends in a $100 pledge or more

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.609
will receive a personally
autographed copy of my book,

01:08:37.689 --> 01:08:39.029
The Secrets of Cone Power Revealed.

01:08:39.109 --> 01:08:40.359
Lovely view.

01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:47.080
It's a $49.95 value, and you
get it absolutely free.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.740
Bond, James Bond.

01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:50.370
Sit, please.

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.040
We need your help. Bless your hearts.

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.680
Well-traveled man.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.010
You did all right at the tables tonight.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.810
I had the feeling my luck
was about to change.

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:18.020
Well, it's a wise gambler who
knows when his luck has run out.

01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:19.229
Why this?

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:21.819
In my business, you prepare
for the unexpected.

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:24.859
And what business is that?

01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:27.779
I help people with problems.

01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:29.740
Problem solver?

01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:31.740
More of a problem eliminator.

01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:47.260
And now you're here on business?

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.220
No. Temporarily unemployed.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.850
I thought I might find work here.

01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:57.100
Well, it's very difficult to
obtain a work permit in Isthmus.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:03.280
Well, one has to show a special
talent that people here don't have.

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:08.240
Well, that shouldn't be too difficult.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:12.950
Senor Bond, you got big cojones.

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.750
You come here to my place, without
references, carrying a piece,

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.790
throwing around a lot of money.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.880
But you should know something...

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:28.300
Nobody saw you come in, so
nobody has to see you go out.

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:36.980
Senor Sanchez, I could be very
useful to a man in your position.

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:38.730
And I understand you have a reputation

01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:41.650
for rewarding loyalty very well.

01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:48.910
I'll keep this for a few days.
We'll talk again.

01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:51.910
And you won't need a gun in Isthmus.

01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:53.410
It's a very safe city.

01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:57.160
In the meantime, I welcome you
to the casino at all times.

01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:09.090
Check him out.

01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:13.140
So what did you find out?

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.520
He's sitting up there behind
two inches of armored glass.

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.020
I'd need a cannon to get to him.

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:37.700
Senor Bond, you'll be pleased
to know your uncle has arrived.

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:39.790
I put him in your suite.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.000
Thank you. Good night, senor.

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:49.840
Your uncle?

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:52.140
Let's make this a proper family reunion.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.680
Give me a gun.

01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:19.290
Stay here.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.810
Really, 007.

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:43.270
Q! What the hell are you doing here?
I might have killed you!

01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:45.060
Well, I'm on leave.

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:48.190
Thought I'd pop around and
see how you're getting on.

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.320
- You all right?
- Yes, of course I'm all right.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.360
- How'd you find me?
- Well, Moneypenny, of course.

01:12:52.450 --> 01:12:54.320
She's worried sick about you!

01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:56.200
This is no place for you, Q. Go home.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.030
Don't be an idiot, 007.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.790
I know exactly what you're up to.

01:12:59.870 --> 01:13:01.950
And quite frankly, you're
gonna need my help.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.080
Remember, if it hadn't been for Q Branch,

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:06.210
you'd have been dead long ago.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.800
Everything for a man on holiday.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.260
Explosive alarm clock.

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:15.010
Guaranteed never to wake
up anybody who uses it.

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:19.140
Dentonite toothpaste, to be used sparingly.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.310
It's the latest in plastic explosive.

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:22.930
I could do with some plastic.

01:13:26.650 --> 01:13:30.530
I thought there might
be a mess to clean up.

01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:32.360
Pam, this is Q, my uncle.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.240
Uncle, this is Miss Kennedy, my cousin.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.910
We must be related.

01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:39.990
How do you do? Now, pay attention, 007.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.370
Now, this looks like an
ordinary camera, doesn't it?

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.040
What kind of film does it take, 120?

01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:49.630
No, .220, high-velocity.

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:57.550
Now, this is a signature gun, and
that is an optical palm reader.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:03.680
And if I plug this into the bottom
like that, once I've programmed it...

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:10.730
Now, nobody can use the gun but you.

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.190
Smile, boys.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.440
Don't use the flash!

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:22.410
Stop fiddling about with
things you don't understand!

01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:23.830
You might easily have killed him.

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:25.410
That's odd.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.130
Look, let's all get some rest, shall we?

01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:34.130
We've got a long, hard day
ahead of us tomorrow.

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:35.630
Good night, Q.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.550
Sweet dreams, Mr. Bond.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.520
I hope you don't snore, Q.

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.940
You all know Truman-Lodge,

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:57.650
and this is my head of
security, Colonel Heller.

01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:03.910
This is an historic moment.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.160
East meets West.

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:08.660
Drug dealers of the world, unite.

01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:15.920
Extra bonus. Your job's done.

01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:17.670
Take Q and fly out of here now.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:20.010
I'll make my own way back.

01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:21.640
I'd like to stay.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.430
No. I work better alone.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.800
In this business, there's a lot of cash,

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.810
and with a lot of people
with their hands out.

01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:51.770
In a word, bribery.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.770
Exactly.

01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:55.770
He took the words right out of my pocket.

01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:59.730
So you pay.

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:02.190
Everyone and his brother is on the payroll.

01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:09.450
So you buy a mayor, a chief
of police, a general,

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.130
Presidents.

01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:19.300
One day you wake up, you own
the whole goddamn country.

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:20.960
Then you take what you want.

01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:25.050
Bank, a gambling casino,
airline concession.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.640
Why?

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.220
Simple. It's easier for the
politicians to take silver than lead.

01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:36.730
We have an invisible empire
from Chile to Alaska.

01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:43.610
What I want to do, amigos,
is to make you part of it.

01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:47.200
I want the Pacific to be our little puddle.

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:53.080
What you have before you,
gentlemen, is a demographic report,

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:56.420
breaking down each of your territories

01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:59.840
by age and socioeconomic group.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.380
Now, as you can clearly see, there
is a huge potential demand,

01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:07.840
given the implementation
of aggressive marketing.

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:09.850
As in the United States,

01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:14.930
Senor Sanchez is prepared to offer
each of you exclusive franchises.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:19.520
The price is $100 million per territory.

01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:26.280
I believe you'll find that works out to
$20 million per metric ton, Mr. Tan.

01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:49.680
We guarantee quality and
price for five years.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.810
Senor Sanchez,

01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:55.680
since arriving, we've eaten well,

01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:57.770
heard many good stories,

01:18:57.850 --> 01:19:01.810
but before I pay anything, I
want to see some hardware.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:06.900
Mr. Kwang, you don't pay for hardware.

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:10.660
You pay for my personal
guarantee and protection.

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:13.580
Surely, if you were to invest $100 million,

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:15.830
you would want some reassurance.

01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:20.790
You know, you're right. Why not?

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.380
Tomorrow, I'll take you to our
main distribution center.

01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:31.010
Here you are.

01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:34.890
Goodbye, Q. Thanks for all you've done.

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:36.140
What?

01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:39.940
You're a hell of a field operative.

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.230
Now, go. I'll see you back in London.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.530
No more business.

01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:57.040
Gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.

01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:59.080
Hi, there!

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.330
- Hi!
- How are you?

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.890
This Kwang, he seems like trouble.

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:17.560
Why show them the labs?

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:21.440
Don't worry. He won't expose the operation.

01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:48.340
His Excellency, el Presidente Lopez.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.360
There's been a mistake with my check.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.240
Look at it. It's half the usual amount.

01:21:12.570 --> 01:21:15.700
You were very quiet when I was arrested.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:21.000
Remember, you're only President for life.

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:50.400
Watch the birdie, you bastard.

01:22:48.670 --> 01:22:50.170
Take his arm.

01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:58.220
Who'd have a signature gun?

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.140
James Bond.

01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:05.930
This is the property of
Her Majesty's government.

01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:07.100
How did you get it?

01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:08.190
Piss off.

01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:09.650
Who ordered you to kill Sanchez?

01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:11.770
No one. He's a rogue agent.

01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:15.070
I've got orders to take him
back, one way or the other.

01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:17.820
We're Hong Kong Narcotics, you bastard!

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.910
Sanchez is taking us to the
heart of his operations.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.580
I've been setting it up for years!

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:27.500
I just hope that little stunt
of yours hasn't scared him off.

01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:33.380
Get me out of these bloody things.

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.800
No, Commander. You're a
loose cannon on deck.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.260
I'm shipping you straight back to London.

01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:47.100
- Leave him!
- No!

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.430
Come on!

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.290
Don't let them take you alive.

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.000
He's still alive.

01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:02.170
Who was it? Who sent you?

01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:07.640
Cyanide.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:20.670
Hey, amigo!

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:30.680
How do you feel?

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:32.890
I'll survive.

01:26:33.810 --> 01:26:35.310
Lupe, please.

01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:43.190
The Wavekrest is arriving tonight.
Krest is coming here.

01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:45.400
No, no, no, I'll call you back.

01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:46.860
Pedro, bring us some coffee, por favor.

01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:48.110
Good.

01:26:51.490 --> 01:26:53.660
Baby, please?

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.970
Well, we both had close calls last night.

01:27:08.050 --> 01:27:09.340
You were just in time.

01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:11.300
Things were about to turn nasty.

01:27:11.970 --> 01:27:13.060
Who were those guys?

01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:14.100
Freelance hit team.

01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:15.770
What did they want with you?

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:19.810
One of them must have
recognized me in the casino.

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:25.940
They were afraid I'd warn
you, spoil their plans.

01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:29.280
So you knew them?

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.200
I used to work for the British government.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.990
We kept dossiers on such people.

01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:35.490
British agent.

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:38.460
I knew it.

01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:43.880
You have class.

01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:47.340
Those men tried to kill me.

01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:50.090
Who would do such a thing?

01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.510
Someone close to you.

01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:52.890
Cream? Sugar?

01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:55.310
No.

01:27:55.390 --> 01:27:57.270
Did they tell you this?

01:27:57.350 --> 01:28:01.100
They were well-briefed, obviously
by someone on the inside.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.690
Did they mention a name?

01:28:04.770 --> 01:28:05.860
No.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.780
Only that they were expecting
to be paid a great deal of cash

01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:15.580
by someone arriving in Isthmus tonight.

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:19.910
You suspect someone?

01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:24.580
Everyone in my organization is 100% loyal.

01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:25.960
Then you have nothing to worry about.

01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:28.920
Yeah, well, I have to go meet some people.

01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.260
Why don't you rest here?

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.800
No. I have to go back to my hotel.

01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:38.180
No. Don't go to the hotel.
Save your money. I insist.

01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:41.270
Stay here. Enjoy my hospitality.

01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.900
Lupe, show him the easy way up, please.

01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:04.250
You are not gonna believe who this guy is.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.380
Former British agent.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:11.920
How did you know that?

01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:13.550
Because I know things.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:18.510
I want to meet Krest's boat tonight.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.310
We'll need a dozen reliable men.

01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:23.020
Is there a problem with Krest?

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:26.480
We'll see. And bring Lupe. She was there.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.940
He's not gonna lie in front of her.

01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.240
What are you doing?

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.370
I've had my fill of Sanchez's hospitality.

01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:38.780
He told you to stay. You're
asking for big trouble.

01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:41.040
Look, there's no need for
you to get involved.

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:43.040
Just give me five minutes,
then scream your head off.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.710
James, please, listen to me.

01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:46.250
There's guards all over the place.

01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:47.540
You'll never make it.

01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:22.410
I'm going shopping. I won't be long.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.120
Please don't. Not now.

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:25.710
Senor Sanchez said.

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.230
I haven't had one of these in five years.

01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:48.690
Don't worry. 007 always comes back.

01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.150
James, hi.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.320
I thought I told you to leave, Q.

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.240
We couldn't go without knowing
what had happened to you.

01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:59.570
Get your bags packed, Q.

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:01.580
What the hell is the matter with you?

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:03.330
Just a couple of things.

01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:05.580
Kwang and his team of
British agents are dead.

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.210
Sanchez is alive.

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:09.290
I saw you in Heller's office.

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:11.130
You're working with them. No.

01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:14.800
I want the truth. I am telling the truth.

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:18.550
Sanchez has arranged to buy four
Stinger missiles from the Contras,

01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:20.640
and he's threatened to shoot
down an American airliner

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.010
if the DEA doesn't lay off.

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:23.810
What's that got to do with you and Heller?

01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:26.220
Felix gave me a letter at his
wedding from the Attorney General

01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:29.770
granting Heller immunity if
he gets the Stingers back.

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:33.570
Did he go for the deal?

01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:35.940
Yes.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.910
And then you missed Sanchez,

01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:42.990
and Heller panicked and
he said the deal was off,

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.750
and that I was dead if
he ever saw me again.

01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:51.040
There's more to this than
your personal vendetta.

01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:58.130
It's a mess.

01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:03.180
Sanchez has tripled his security.

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.560
You'll never get another shot at him.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.110
We don't have to.

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:20.030
Meet me at the harbor
master's office in two hours.

01:32:20.110 --> 01:32:22.570
Q, bring the Rolls round
to the front of the hotel.

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:24.280
Yes, sir.

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:28.040
Senor Bond.

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.910
Senor Montelongo, I'm making a withdrawal.

01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:51.850
Pilot coming aboard, sir.

01:32:55.730 --> 01:32:57.900
Well? Take me to the bridge.

01:33:04.410 --> 01:33:06.410
Gracias, Captain. I'll take over now.

01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:09.120
You? You're the harbor pilot?

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.410
No, I'm his secretary!

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.710
All yours, sir... Ma'am.

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:32.020
Do you think you're going
in a bit too fast?

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:35.020
You wanna do the driving?
You take the wheel.

01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:46.700
Full speed astern.

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.790
What the hell are you doing?

01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:56.120
Check the forward component!

01:33:56.210 --> 01:33:57.580
Harbor pilot went crazy.

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:34.330
I'd stick to flying if I were you.

01:34:34.410 --> 01:34:36.080
I got the job done.

01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:50.850
Franz, what a surprise!

01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:52.680
I didn't think you'd be here.

01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:54.850
Yeah. I like surprises.

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.860
You seem to be having a
lot of problems lately.

01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:06.950
Well, we had this crazy harbor pilot.

01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:09.700
Let's talk about the money you owe me.

01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:12.950
Why don't we talk inside.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:22.090
- Does he have a safe?
- Not up here. Maybe below.

01:35:24.130 --> 01:35:25.760
Have a look around.

01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:39.850
Do I have this right?

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:42.690
He water-skied behind the
plane, jumps on it...

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:46.320
No, no. He was...

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:47.570
Well, yeah.

01:35:47.650 --> 01:35:49.650
He threw the pilots out and flew away.

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.030
Like a little bird.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.840
The knife.

01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:23.770
Pedro.

01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:42.500
Would I make up a story like that?
You must have seen something.

01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:57.350
- Where's 007?
- He's coming.

01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.990
That's not my money. I swear.

01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:17.240
That's right, amigo. It's mine.

01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:24.330
You think I'm stupid, huh?

01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:28.590
You rip me off, then use my own
money to pay someone to kill me?

01:37:28.670 --> 01:37:31.630
You want it so bad? Then take it!

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:36.390
What are you doing?

01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:41.100
Wait. Let me talk. It's not my money!

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:48.440
No! What the...

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.690
That hurts. Please!

01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:58.700
What are you doing?

01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:00.290
Sanchez.

01:38:08.630 --> 01:38:11.750
Please, Franz. No!

01:38:27.150 --> 01:38:29.480
What about the money, patron?

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:33.070
Launder it.

01:38:50.290 --> 01:38:51.670
This is where you leave.

01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:53.920
Take the plane. I'll see you both in Miami.

01:38:54.010 --> 01:38:55.420
Aren't you coming?

01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:59.090
No. They'll be after me.
It'll be safer on my own.

01:39:11.650 --> 01:39:13.570
Come on, my dear.

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:24.540
See you later.

01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:30.330
What's that?

01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:31.880
Bond's clothes. They're clean.

01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:52.360
Sorry to wake you, hermano.

01:39:57.530 --> 01:40:01.320
I thought you'd like to know the
information you gave me paid off.

01:40:01.410 --> 01:40:03.740
I got the guy who set me up.

01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:06.200
Only one guy?

01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:07.830
What do you mean?

01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:10.210
I just thought that

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.920
no one would be stupid enough to
try to take you on on their own.

01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:27.600
Listen, I want you to
come with me tomorrow.

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.390
Where are we going?

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:33.270
It's a surprise. You're gonna like it.

01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:50.620
James, what are you doing back here?

01:40:50.710 --> 01:40:52.870
I don't think your being
here's a good idea, Lupe.

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:57.000
It's all right. Franz is having
dinner with the Chinese.

01:40:58.210 --> 01:40:59.760
Do you know where he's taking me tomorrow?

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:01.590
He's showing them a special place.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.470
I don't know where.

01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:07.510
James, don't go. I'm scared.
What's gonna happen to us?

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.810
Don't worry.

01:41:08.890 --> 01:41:11.140
When this is all over, I'll
make sure you get back home.

01:41:11.230 --> 01:41:14.060
Home? It took me 15 years
to get away from there.

01:41:14.150 --> 01:41:16.980
I don't wanna go back.

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.570
Can't we leave together?

01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:21.150
I'll be safe with you.

01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:29.990
No, Lupe. I don't think
that would work out.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.330
How can we tell unless we try?

01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:42.550
I think it's gonna work out very well.

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:51.680
All right. I'll answer it.

01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:58.690
Miss Kennedy, I saw you
at the casino with James.

01:41:58.770 --> 01:42:01.190
We need to speak in private.

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.570
It's all right. He's with me.

01:42:02.650 --> 01:42:05.320
James is in danger. Sanchez is no fool.

01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:10.030
He's checking up on him. You know,
if they find anything suspicious...

01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:12.620
Listen, it's all right. He's
safely out of the country by now.

01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:13.910
You don't understand.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.580
Last night, he stayed with me.

01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:21.170
At Sanchez's house?

01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.130
Si. Franz is taking him on a trip.

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:25.300
They leave in an hour. You must help him.

01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:28.010
If anything happens to him,
I don't know what I'll do.

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:29.970
You know, I love James so much.

01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:32.310
Look, you must go before you're missed.

01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:36.310
Now, don't worry. We'll think of something.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:41.190
"I love James so much." I'll
be damned if I'll help him.

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:44.490
Look, don't judge him too harshly, my dear.

01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:47.740
Field operatives must often use
every means at their disposal

01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:50.450
to achieve their objectives.

01:42:50.530 --> 01:42:51.830
Bullshit.

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:08.510
Bond's just left in convoy.
Two cars and a Jeep,

01:43:08.590 --> 01:43:10.430
turning north onto the main highway.

01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:12.720
- I copy that, Q.
- Over and out.

01:43:22.150 --> 01:43:24.650
What are you doing to my plane?

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:27.950
Overhaul. Senor Sanchez order it.

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:33.580
I must have a plane. Where can I rent one?

01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:36.580
No planes.

01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.760
You brought the Stingers, manito.

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:51.140
From now on, I want them close to me.

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:25.130
We started this place strictly as a cover,

01:44:25.210 --> 01:44:29.010
but Professor Joe manages
to turn a tidy profit.

01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:54.870
Welcome. This way, please.

01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:59.160
I'm going to have to ask that
each of you put on one of these.

01:44:59.250 --> 01:45:04.080
It's for your own safety, so
I'm sure you'll understand.

01:45:04.170 --> 01:45:09.130
We can't have our best customers
developing a drug habit.

01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:12.130
This way, gentlemen.

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:54.510
Our product dissolves completely
in ordinary gasoline,

01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:57.470
making it absolutely undetectable.

01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:03.560
How do you get it back?

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:09.770
Hey, you want us to tell you all
our secrets before we're partners?

01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:11.360
Take them to the lab.

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:13.070
This way, gentlemen.

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:25.460
Who's the new guy?

01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:27.960
Somebody I thought could be useful.

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:41.810
Can I help you?

01:46:41.890 --> 01:46:44.020
I have a special surprise
for Professor Joe.

01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:45.560
Sorry. No visitors this week.

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.980
I came all the way from Wichita Falls.

01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:50.230
- I'm sorry.
- The folks back home took up a collection.

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:53.030
They'd be so disappointed if Professor
Joe didn't accept it personally.

01:46:55.450 --> 01:46:59.530
You may remove your masks now, gentlemen.

01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:01.950
So, do we have a deal?

01:47:05.290 --> 01:47:07.080
The terms, gentlemen,

01:47:07.170 --> 01:47:10.920
were $100 million in negotiable
bearer bonds from each of you.

01:47:12.670 --> 01:47:13.670
Welcome.

01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:25.310
Professor Joe. It's really you!

01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:30.060
It's magnificent.

01:47:30.150 --> 01:47:34.780
Rebuilt stone for stone and restored
to all of its original glory.

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.900
Is this for me?

01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:38.610
Yes, I almost forgot. I got so flustered...

01:47:40.410 --> 01:47:44.200
Tell me, child, have you ever
thought of studying here?

01:47:44.290 --> 01:47:45.790
Would that be possible?

01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:48.410
Come along. Let's see if
you have the aptitude.

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:51.960
To a long association.

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:53.090
What's the process?

01:47:53.210 --> 01:47:54.300
It's very simple.

01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:02.550
An 18% mixture of cocaine
and ordinary gasoline.

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.260
Just keep quiet.

01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:31.870
We already have your first shipment being
loaded into the four tanker trucks.

01:48:32.250 --> 01:48:34.210
Welcome, my dear.

01:48:36.090 --> 01:48:37.880
Please join me.

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:47.060
This is my humble sanctuary away
from the cares of the world.

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:50.480
Your own private meditation chamber.

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:53.850
Built from the sacred rocks
of the original temple.

01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:02.400
I did have it soundproofed, so
nothing will disturb our meditation.

01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:08.950
I brought you another surprise.

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:10.960
I love surprises. Where is it?

01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:24.470
Look, this really isn't necessary.

01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:28.810
Give me the keys.

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:43.950
Bless your heart.

01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:47.700
Your monthly delivery will
be by ocean-going tanker.

01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:53.120
We'll send our chief chemist along to
supervise the reconversion process.

01:49:53.210 --> 01:49:57.540
You'll keep the gas as a bonus.

01:49:57.630 --> 01:50:01.380
And if there's a problem
with customs, no evidence.

01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:16.520
Come on, hurry!

01:50:23.610 --> 01:50:25.820
I know him. He's an informer.

01:50:28.530 --> 01:50:30.410
You disappoint me.

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:34.660
Who are you working for, huh? Tell me.

01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:41.170
You don't wanna talk?

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:59.650
I can get the trucks out, but I
don't think I can control the fire.

01:50:59.730 --> 01:51:03.440
Forget the fire. Get some cars. We're
gonna take the tankers with us.

01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:06.490
Wait a minute. This setup
cost us $32 million.

01:51:06.570 --> 01:51:07.950
We have to try and save it.

01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:09.780
I don't give a shit about the setup.

01:51:09.870 --> 01:51:11.990
We've got $500 million in the case and

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:14.370
20 tons of Colombian pure in the tankers.

01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:15.580
Now go help Heller.

01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:18.750
But we have a deal with the Orientals.
We've got their money.

01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:20.500
I said go help Heller.

01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:30.510
Now, do you wanna make this hard or easy?

01:51:35.890 --> 01:51:37.850
Put him in the conveyor.

01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:50.820
When you're up to your ankles,

01:51:50.910 --> 01:51:52.870
you're gonna beg to tell me everything.

01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:56.790
When you're up to your knees,
you'll kiss my ass to kill you.

01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:03.590
I'm the least of your problems, Sanchez.

01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:06.800
If you couldn't trust
Krest, who can you trust?

01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:12.340
Who's got your $500 million?

01:52:12.430 --> 01:52:13.970
Truman-Lodge?

01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:19.350
What about the Stingers?

01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:24.940
What do you know about Stingers?

01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:31.070
We gotta go, patron. This
place'll blow up any second.

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:32.110
Where's Heller?

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:33.240
I don't know.

01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:36.830
That's the last you'll see
of Heller and your Stingers.

01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:43.210
Thanks for the advice.

01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:59.310
Have my car meet me up at the top.
Braun, come with me.

01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:39.220
You're dead.

01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:42.060
You took the words right out of my mouth.

01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:54.610
Sanchez!

01:54:02.910 --> 01:54:04.750
Are you all right?

01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:06.750
Switch the bloody machine off.

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:24.390
Hey. I was making sure these were secure.

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:28.190
It's a good idea. Take them up to my car.

01:54:28.610 --> 01:54:29.820
Of course.

01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:16.360
Oh, God. It's Heller.

01:55:16.450 --> 01:55:18.360
Yeah. Looks like he came to a dead end.

01:55:18.450 --> 01:55:19.700
Come on.

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:35.960
Come on! Come on! Follow me!

01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:46.270
You. Come with me.

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:06.450
Come on.

01:56:22.010 --> 01:56:23.430
Surprise!

01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:27.180
Bless your heart!

01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:15.960
Perez.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.420
Bond has escaped.

01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:19.880
Meet me at Paso del Diablo.

01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:13.270
Don't worry. It's only money.

01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:41.920
Okay, que pase.

02:01:35.410 --> 02:01:37.370
Oh, no.

02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:41.040
Shit!

02:01:53.380 --> 02:01:56.090
Brilliant.

02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:57.970
Well done, Franz.

02:01:58.060 --> 02:02:01.980
Another $80 million write-off.

02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:04.350
I guess it's time to
start cutting overhead.

02:04:09.230 --> 02:04:11.480
Dame el Stinger!

02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:14.040
James!

02:07:10.450 --> 02:07:11.910
You could have had everything.

02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:13.950
Don't you want to know why?

02:08:14.010 --> 02:08:16.180
What are you waiting for? Get in.

02:08:17.770 --> 02:08:19.060
Yes, sir.

02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:33.870
I'll be up to see you next week.
We'll do some fishing.

02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:36.450
Good. I'll be out by then. M called.

02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:40.040
He tried to reach you. I think
he may have a job for you.

02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:43.250
Look, Felix, I have to go.
My hostess has just arrived.

02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:44.340
Take care, James.

02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:46.090
You, too. Goodbye.

02:08:49.010 --> 02:08:50.260
I thought you hated that thing.

02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:53.850
Don't you know, iguanas
are a girl's best friend.

02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:03.480
Well, here's to you, my dear.

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.020
Cheers.

02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:08.900
Thank you for everything, James.

02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:13.660
Thank you.

02:09:26.130 --> 02:09:28.380
You could stay here with me.

02:09:29.670 --> 02:09:30.760
Excuse me.

02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:46.690
I think you and el Presidente
will make a perfect couple.

02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:22.390
Why don't you wait until you're asked?

02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:25.060
So, why don't you ask me?

02:10:30.610 --> 02:10:34.900
Used to be that I believed in something.

02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:40.330
Used to be that I believed in love.

02:10:41.410 --> 02:10:46.120
It's been a long time since
I've had that feeling

02:10:46.210 --> 02:10:52.380
I could love someone I could trust someone

02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:57.970
I said I'd never let nobody
near my heart again, darling

02:10:58.050 --> 02:11:03.600
I said I'd never let nobody in.

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:09.060
If you asked me to

02:11:09.150 --> 02:11:15.700
I just might change my mind And
let you in my life forever.

02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:20.200
If you asked me to

02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:26.710
I just might give my heart And
stay here in your arms forever.

02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:31.290
If you asked me to.

02:11:33.130 --> 02:11:37.930
Somehow ever since I've been around you.

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:43.220
Can't go back to being on my own.

02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:48.640
Can't help feeling, darling
Since I've found you.

02:11:48.730 --> 02:11:54.900
That I've found my home
That I'm finally home

02:11:54.990 --> 02:12:00.490
I said I'd never let nobody
get too close to me, darling

02:12:00.570 --> 02:12:05.700
I said I needed Needed to be free.

02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:10.120
If you asked me to

02:12:10.210 --> 02:12:16.760
I just might change my mind And
let you in my life forever.

02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:21.260
If you asked me to

02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:27.890
I just might give my heart And
stay here in your arms forever.

02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:31.310
If you.

02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:35.940
Ask me to and I will give my world.

02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:41.660
To you, baby I need you now.

02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:44.280
Ask me to and I'll do anything.

02:12:44.410 --> 02:12:46.950
Anything.

02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:52.960
For you baby For you baby.

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:55.040
