02:43.747 --> 02:46.796
<i>There was nothing in their backgrounds</i>

02:47.959 --> 02:49.632
<i>that would suggest,</i>

02:50.462 --> 02:53.466
<i>you know, something like that
would... would happen.</i>

02:56.510 --> 02:58.558
I... I was at a loss.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.487
<i>They were pretty darn good kids.</i>

03:08.980 --> 03:11.358
These boys weren't criminals,
they didn't have records.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.028
And, you know,
for something like this to happen,

03:14.111 --> 03:18.790
to the boys and to the school,
of course, it was a big loss at the time.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.802
<i>We were in shock.</i>

03:32.045 --> 03:33.467
<i>I mean, we did not expect...</i>

03:34.423 --> 03:36.050
<i>that from our son, ever.</i>

03:39.386 --> 03:41.605
It's like we woke up in a nightmare.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.534
<i>Everything in our family was</i>

04:02.617 --> 04:04.790
<i>geared towards our kids to be successful.</i>

04:07.164 --> 04:08.211
<i>It was just a...</i>

04:08.874 --> 04:11.172
<i>a moment which we lost him.</i>

04:23.013 --> 04:23.855
Sorry.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.689
Spencer. Thank you for waiting.

05:07.182 --> 05:10.106
We've been very impressed with your portfolio

05:10.685 --> 05:13.313
and the exceptional
commendations of your teachers.

05:13.522 --> 05:17.322
But now we're hoping to find out
a little bit more about you personally.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.406
Um, like my family background, stuff?

05:21.863 --> 05:23.536
Whatever you think is most relevant.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.084
Just tell us a little bit about who you are.

05:28.078 --> 05:28.954
Well...

05:29.371 --> 05:30.714
My name is Spencer Reinhard.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.920
I'm from Lexington, Kentucky,
and I'm 30 years old

05:34.000 --> 05:36.594
for another... less than a month, I guess.

05:38.630 --> 05:41.475
My father, he is, uh, an engineer.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.848
My mom is a stay-at-home mom, I guess.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.601
Let me stop you there. That's great.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.854
I suppose, what we'd really like to know,

05:50.976 --> 05:51.977
is about you.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.153
Like, uh, hobbies and stuff?

05:58.233 --> 06:00.782
What do you hope to express with your work?

06:01.403 --> 06:02.245
I mean...

06:03.613 --> 06:06.367
Who are you as an artist?

06:23.592 --> 06:25.310
Next one! Next one!

06:26.219 --> 06:28.643
Mr. Reinhard, the honorable man, if you will.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.309
Um, he strives for the generosity
of the generous.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.730
For the humility of the humble.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.360
The honorable man is...

06:46.406 --> 06:48.158
Suck it up! Suck it up!

06:48.575 --> 06:50.543
Suck it up! Suck it up!

06:50.994 --> 06:53.088
- Suck it up! Suck it up!
- Hit it!

06:53.705 --> 06:55.423
Suck it up! Suck it up!

07:38.291 --> 07:39.543
<i>Growing up, I had a...</i>

07:40.502 --> 07:44.382
a desire for some kind
of life-altering experience.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.099
<i>I started to read about other artists.</i>

07:51.096 --> 07:54.100
<i>They were always affected
by some kind of tragedy in their life,</i>

07:54.182 --> 07:56.355
<i>and had to suffer a great deal.</i>

07:57.811 --> 07:59.358
Van Gogh ended up killing himself.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.402
Monet went blind.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.361
<i>I felt like they understood
something more about life</i>

08:06.444 --> 08:08.321
<i>that I wasn't getting to experience.</i>

08:11.491 --> 08:13.164
Art has to be about more than just...

08:15.537 --> 08:18.040
"My life is great,
and I'm really good at drawing."

08:38.018 --> 08:39.645
<i>About fucking time.</i>

08:40.311 --> 08:41.357
What do you mean it's about time?

08:41.438 --> 08:42.859
<i>I left you like a zillion messages.</i>

08:42.938 --> 08:44.907
You haven't left me
a message in weeks, Warren.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.277
<i>Anyway, do you wanna do something?</i>

08:47.360 --> 08:49.237
- I think I'm gonna go to bed.
- <i>I'm coming over.</i>

08:49.446 --> 08:51.619
Seriously, man, fuck fraternities.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.745
The reason to be a part of that is so one day

08:53.825 --> 08:56.122
you can walk in the door
of an office you never wanna go in

08:56.202 --> 08:57.579
to see a guy you never wanna meet,

08:58.038 --> 08:59.790
all on the hopes that he might give you a job

08:59.873 --> 09:01.125
you never wanna fucking do.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.084
Something I've often thought about, is how,

09:03.710 --> 09:05.883
my life would've been different
if I hadn't met Warren.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.140
So this is the, uh...

09:11.051 --> 09:13.224
dinosaur, T-Rex,

09:14.929 --> 09:16.351
trying to turn off a ceiling fan.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.854
<i>Warren was definitely somebody</i>

09:19.934 --> 09:22.983
that my mom did not want me
to be friends with.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.152
We were not thrilled
with the relationship with Warren,

09:26.232 --> 09:28.280
but we accepted it because...

09:31.362 --> 09:32.363
that was his friend.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.868
You need to have a little bit of...

09:36.618 --> 09:37.836
spice...

09:39.496 --> 09:40.588
in the broth.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.377
And Warren probably was that spice.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.383
People have said that...

09:48.296 --> 09:49.634
I was the ring leader,

09:49.714 --> 09:51.432
but that's just not true.

09:51.966 --> 09:52.933
There was no ring leader.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.016
Yes! Shit!

09:55.553 --> 09:56.516
Did I work here?

09:56.596 --> 09:57.684
Half of this shit got wasted.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.767
Literally, thrown in the fucking trash.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.480
Hand me the flashlight.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.691
Uh, Warren, what are we doing here?

10:07.941 --> 10:10.363
Did you know that 40%
of restaurant food in America

10:10.443 --> 10:12.036
gets thrown in the trash? Just thrown away.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.615
We are the fattest
fucking nation on the planet,

10:14.823 --> 10:16.575
and we still throw nearly half
of our food away.

10:17.826 --> 10:18.827
- I mean, kids are starving...
- Fuck, man.

10:18.910 --> 10:19.911
...in Africa, dude.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.374
It's fucking tragic.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.832
What the fuck are we gonna do with this, huh?

10:24.415 --> 10:25.837
We're saving it from landfill.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.672
Do you eat avocados? They're over...

10:27.752 --> 10:28.965
No, I'm fine, Warren...

10:29.045 --> 10:30.763
- Shit.
- Run! Run, run, run, run, run!

10:31.881 --> 10:34.305
Don't drop the fucking meat. Goddammit.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.554
Next time, you're gonna get
a fucking bullet, Warren!

10:38.179 --> 10:39.852
Fuck 'em up in their ass!

10:41.141 --> 10:42.438
Whoo!

10:45.436 --> 10:46.274
- Drive. Drive.
- I'm driving.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.776
I'm driving. I'm driving!

10:47.856 --> 10:49.574
I'm driving! I'm driving!

10:51.025 --> 10:52.368
<i># I'm alive #</i>

10:53.278 --> 10:55.867
<i># And I see things
Mighty clear today #</i>

10:55.947 --> 10:57.324
<i># I'm alive #</i>

11:00.827 --> 11:01.874
<i># I'm real #</i>

11:03.288 --> 11:05.666
<i># I can taste and touch
And see and feel #</i>

11:05.748 --> 11:06.920
<i># I'm alive #</i>

11:12.213 --> 11:13.635
Look at these fucks.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.511
We should just rev up
and put 'em out of their misery.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.558
I don't even know what we're doing back here.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.231
Whoo!

11:24.017 --> 11:26.361
So, did you meet
any new cool people over there?

11:27.270 --> 11:29.068
No. Bunch of jocks.

11:29.856 --> 11:30.698
You?

11:31.983 --> 11:32.825
No.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.119
Uh-uh.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.656
It's not what I thought it would be.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.673
Do you ever wonder,
you ended up being born you...

11:48.041 --> 11:49.918
here, and not someone else?

11:54.339 --> 11:57.764
Do you ever feel like you're waiting
for something to happen,

12:01.054 --> 12:02.226
but you don't know what it is?

12:04.891 --> 12:05.733
But, it's...

12:08.645 --> 12:10.363
that thing that could, um...

12:12.482 --> 12:13.700
make your life special.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.696
Yeah.

12:19.614 --> 12:20.615
Like what?

12:22.575 --> 12:23.667
Exactly.

12:24.827 --> 12:25.874
"Like what?"

12:27.705 --> 12:29.043
<i>Good news if you woke up wondering</i>

12:29.123 --> 12:31.171
<i>if you're living
in the right town today, folks.</i>

12:31.417 --> 12:33.511
<i>'Cause</i> Forbes Magazine <i>votes Lexington</i>

12:33.795 --> 12:36.674
<i>fourteenth best place in the US
for business and careers.</i>

12:39.592 --> 12:41.556
<i>If there is a book you cannot find,</i>

12:41.636 --> 12:43.809
<i>either on the shelves or on the computer,</i>

12:44.347 --> 12:47.851
<i>please make a point of asking
a member of the library staff.</i>

12:49.185 --> 12:52.109
Through these doors
live the special collection.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.737
And in future, you will require
an appointment to go through these doors,

12:55.817 --> 12:57.488
and you will need to be accompanied

12:57.568 --> 13:01.072
by a member of the library staff
at all times.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.457
Someone take the door. Thank you.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.755
Many of the books in this library

13:13.835 --> 13:16.174
have been here since the 19th century,

13:16.254 --> 13:18.006
and we are very pleased to be home

13:18.089 --> 13:21.343
to some of the rarest editions
in the United States.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.017
John James Audubon

13:25.513 --> 13:28.187
is responsible for this masterpiece here.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.777
First edition, <i>Birds of America.</i>

13:32.478 --> 13:34.275
He lived here in Kentucky.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.859
He had some misfortune in business,
went to prison for debt.

13:38.401 --> 13:41.491
When he left prison,
he headed for the wilderness

13:41.571 --> 13:43.868
with a gun, some paint,

13:43.948 --> 13:47.452
and a deep desire to paint
every bird in America.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.956
And when he came back into civilization,

13:51.581 --> 13:55.381
he was acclaimed as one of
the foremost figures in American art.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.463
So, how much is it worth?

13:58.004 --> 14:01.427
Well, we don't discuss
the worth of our books,

14:01.507 --> 14:03.350
but I can assure you that Mr. Audubon

14:03.968 --> 14:05.139
would never have imagined

14:05.219 --> 14:07.722
that his book would be
the most valuable in existence.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.146
Now, most of you are familiar with this book.

14:12.226 --> 14:15.275
Arguably among
the most important ever written.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.608
Darwin's <i>On The Origin of Species.</i>

14:18.024 --> 14:21.494
Please look at line number ten,
and tell me what you see.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.243
Species is spelt wrong.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.246
That's correct. Species is...

14:42.882 --> 14:44.225
Will you be joining us, sir?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.823
I'm pretty sure he told me
about it at Richard's party.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.827
I remember it being cold.

15:06.697 --> 15:07.573
A book?

15:07.865 --> 15:09.788
In what world can a book
be worth $12 million?

15:10.743 --> 15:12.290
It's not really a book.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.714
It's more like a collection of paintings.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.000
I think I told him about it in the car.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.802
Maybe November. It was cold.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.759
I still don't understand how a book
could be worth $12 million.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.726
So like if Picasso
had a bunch of his paintings

15:30.221 --> 15:31.268
in a book.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.643
When you say it's in the library,
it's like, what...

15:35.852 --> 15:37.229
sitting on a shelf?

15:37.311 --> 15:41.066
No, it's in the, uh,
special collections room.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.696
Which is what? Like a vault?

15:43.276 --> 15:46.780
More like a secure room
with glass cases and stuff.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.789
With guards on the doors and shit?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.584
No, but obviously,
you can't just walk in there.

15:52.952 --> 15:53.999
Hey, pull in here.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.625
'Cause there's security everywhere?

15:56.456 --> 15:57.457
Not that I saw.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.050
Well...

16:00.751 --> 16:01.673
what, then?

16:05.673 --> 16:07.516
Because you have to make an appointment.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.492
So, this is how you remember it?

16:26.527 --> 16:27.528
Not exactly.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.286
But if this is how Spencer remembers it,

16:31.365 --> 16:32.287
then let's go with it.

16:37.747 --> 16:38.748
<i>It's $12 million.</i>

16:41.709 --> 16:43.256
Could we get it?

16:44.212 --> 16:46.055
You know, like, what would it take?

16:46.547 --> 16:49.392
It would take extraordinary effort to get it.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.351
<i>Not ordinary effort.</i>

17:06.858 --> 17:07.701
What?

17:08.486 --> 17:09.532
I think you know what.

17:13.907 --> 17:16.411
There's been so much, "Who brought it up?

17:16.493 --> 17:17.837
Who kinda started it?"

17:18.037 --> 17:20.165
I feel like he was fishing...

17:20.248 --> 17:22.000
and that I took the bait.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.923
It would be true to say that
once Warren latches on to an idea,

17:26.002 --> 17:29.178
that he's not easily going to let it go.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.086
<i>Look, all I'm saying is
that nothing will happen,</i>

18:04.166 --> 18:05.713
<i>unless you make something happen.</i>

18:06.752 --> 18:08.595
We're supposed to be hunter-gatherers, man.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.224
And our whole life,
we're just unwrapping shit.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.639
Packaging, packaging, packaging.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.262
The illusion of choice.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.643
It's bullshit, man.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.937
Everyone in here thinks that
they're gonna win the lottery,

18:21.017 --> 18:22.064
but no one buys a ticket.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.903
Well, yeah, a prison would be a...

18:25.605 --> 18:26.982
nice change of scenery.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.905
Well, what about ending up
on a fucking boat in the Caribbean?

18:30.985 --> 18:32.362
Like the end of <i>Shawshank Redemption.</i>

18:32.445 --> 18:33.446
Oh, my God.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.038
What about that?

18:36.157 --> 18:37.875
They'd been in prison for 20 years.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.753
And sorry to burst your bubble, but, uh,

18:41.078 --> 18:43.206
it doesn't work like that
in real life, Warren.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.835
Bad guys, they don't get
to ride off into the sunset

18:46.917 --> 18:48.256
- with the money and...
- Wait a second.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.257
...the gold, and, uh...

18:49.337 --> 18:50.555
How will we be the bad guys?

18:51.422 --> 18:53.174
Uh, we'd be the robbers.

18:58.554 --> 18:59.772
Aren't you even curious...

19:00.681 --> 19:02.149
in your little, little brain,

19:02.516 --> 19:04.634
to find out what would actually happen?

19:07.897 --> 19:08.864
Aren't you curious?

19:09.440 --> 19:10.278
Find out what?

19:10.358 --> 19:13.112
To find out what would
really happen in real life.

19:22.620 --> 19:23.457
I've lost count.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.127
Can you go, man, please? I work here, Warren.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.334
- I work...
- Listen to me.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.759
- Come on.
- Listen to me.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.588
I gotta do this shit.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.765
We're gonna need the blueprints.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.592
We're gonna need to know
the exits and entry points.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.804
We're gonna need to know the staff entrances
and the fastest way out of the building

19:39.887 --> 19:41.355
at any given point in time.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.189
What do you say?

19:49.689 --> 19:50.816
You don't need blueprints.

19:51.649 --> 19:52.650
We can just draw it.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.573
<i>These guys are fools.</i>

19:59.031 --> 20:00.494
<i>They can't afford to weasel out on the deal.</i>

20:00.574 --> 20:02.167
<i>If they did, they'd be washed up, okay?</i>

20:02.451 --> 20:04.044
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Any other questions?</i>

20:05.955 --> 20:07.332
<i>Well, let's take a look at this, then.</i>

20:08.499 --> 20:12.129
<i>This is a rough drawing
of the track, as I remember it.</i>

20:12.920 --> 20:14.638
<i>There aren't exactly books</i>

20:15.047 --> 20:18.301
that instruct you on how to steal art.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.308
<i>I want you to go over this thing
with me inch-by-inch.</i>

20:21.887 --> 20:23.351
<i>Add or subtract the slightest change,</i>

20:23.431 --> 20:25.900
<i>even if it's something as small
as the placement of a hot dog stand.</i>

20:26.350 --> 20:29.565
5:10, tall, redhead, librarian one,

20:29.645 --> 20:30.692
leaves for the evening.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.114
5:11,

20:39.905 --> 20:42.704
short, male administrative assistant returns.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.722
Hold the door, please.

20:57.923 --> 21:01.928
Many of the books in this library
have been here since the 19th century.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.333
Neither of us were really serious
about the idea.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.210
I took it very seriously from the start.

21:33.751 --> 21:34.969
Warren, there's no secret knock.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.470
Yeah, well, there should be.

21:38.923 --> 21:39.760
Hi.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.396
You lost your fake ID already, didn't you?

21:46.764 --> 21:49.313
Actually, I came
to talk to you about something.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.061
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

21:51.936 --> 21:52.778
What's up?

21:56.482 --> 21:59.782
What if I have something to get rid of?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.281
What thing are you talking about?

22:05.199 --> 22:06.200
Something rare.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.044
So, you're looking for a fence?

22:14.625 --> 22:16.673
I'm looking for a guy
who's gonna buy something rare.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.428
Right.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.133
I don't wanna hear anything about this.

22:22.925 --> 22:25.053
But, I know a guy
you might be able to talk to.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.227
But I've only met him once.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.647
And, I don't know
if I can vouch for him, so...

22:28.973 --> 22:30.475
- Do you understand?
- Absolutely, I get it.

22:33.394 --> 22:34.395
Okay.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.997
He's out in New York.
He does not like phone calls.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.461
How do I get in touch with him?

22:55.749 --> 22:57.547
- <i>What is this?</i>
- <i>That's a fence.</i>

22:58.419 --> 22:59.466
What's a fence?

23:00.004 --> 23:00.880
"What's a fence?"

23:02.548 --> 23:04.596
A fence is somebody who buys stolen shit.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.311
We're supposed to email that guy,
ask him for a meeting,

23:07.970 --> 23:09.347
and sign off with the name "Terry".

23:10.598 --> 23:12.851
And he said to never email
from the same account twice.

23:15.352 --> 23:16.440
How fucking cool is that?

23:16.520 --> 23:19.114
- Good work.
- Thank you.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.871
"Best, Terry."

23:27.031 --> 23:27.907
Happy?

23:27.990 --> 23:29.583
- I wanna change that...
- Oops.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.250
I just don't get, like,
what a "good faith" payment is.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.761
I mean, we give him 500 bucks for a meeting?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.427
It's to show we're serious
and not time-wasters.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.467
I would've thought, driving
across the country for 12 hours

23:46.550 --> 23:48.052
was a good demonstration of that.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.603
It's just how it's done, man.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.309
Oh, you know this
from all your previous heists?

23:52.389 --> 23:53.356
Would you relax?

23:58.729 --> 24:00.026
What would you do with the money?

24:02.441 --> 24:03.659
Aren't artists supposed to starve?

24:04.234 --> 24:06.453
<i>You're listening
to your favorite oldies station.</i>

24:06.820 --> 24:10.245
<i>Back-to-back hits
from the '50s, '60s and '70s.</i>

24:24.755 --> 24:27.099
<i># Many years since I was here #</i>

24:29.510 --> 24:33.100
<i># On the street
I was passin' my time away #</i>

24:33.180 --> 24:36.275
<i>We were out of Kentucky,</i>
<i>and nobody knows that we're gone.</i>

24:37.017 --> 24:39.315
<i>There was a sense of possibility.</i>

24:40.437 --> 24:42.940
Real things were actually
starting to happen, and they were...

24:43.357 --> 24:46.030
It was changing...
changing our lives right then.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.909
<i># Here I am, and in this city #</i>

24:49.822 --> 24:51.911
<i># With a fistful of dollars #</i>

24:51.991 --> 24:54.538
<i># And baby You'd better believe #</i>

24:54.618 --> 24:57.997
<i># I'm back
Back in the New York Groove #</i>

24:59.665 --> 25:03.420
<i># I'm back
Back in the New York Groove #</i>

25:04.670 --> 25:08.391
<i># I'm back
Back in the New York Groove #</i>

25:10.217 --> 25:11.093
<i># Back #</i>

25:31.780 --> 25:34.828
<i>I was fearful at the time
that, if the guy didn't show up,</i>

25:34.908 --> 25:36.160
<i>that this fantasy would be over,</i>

25:36.243 --> 25:37.620
and we'd be going back to Kentucky,

25:37.703 --> 25:42.175
and... things would kinda resume
their normal, uh, course.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.989
<i>And then, suddenly, Warren's talking to a guy</i>

26:10.069 --> 26:11.446
<i>with a ponytail and a blue scarf.</i>

26:12.571 --> 26:13.789
<i>Or was it a purple scarf?</i>

26:26.668 --> 26:28.045
The guy was in his 50s.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.553
I mean, white hair, and well-dressed.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.187
<i>He hands me the piece of paper,</i>

26:41.809 --> 26:43.903
<i>and that was that,
he didn't even count the money.</i>

26:48.774 --> 26:49.650
Hi.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.698
So, what'd he say? What'd he say?

26:54.780 --> 26:55.781
He wasn't the buyer.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.415
But he gave us a contact.

26:58.075 --> 26:58.951
The fence.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.163
So, that guy wasn't the fence?

27:02.246 --> 27:03.919
I thought you said he was the fence.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.131
I guess not.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.342
We just...

27:08.001 --> 27:10.090
We spent $500 on an email address.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.013
Now all we have to do is contact this guy.

27:12.798 --> 27:13.970
He says he speaks English.

27:15.092 --> 27:15.934
What?

27:17.594 --> 27:18.641
He's...

27:19.054 --> 27:20.517
Let's go get some food.
Come on, I'm freezing.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.686
Uh, why wouldn't he speak English, Warren?

27:22.766 --> 27:23.767
Warren.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.194
<i>"Sir, thank you for your email.</i>

27:34.111 --> 27:36.408
<i>I'm afraid we only do business in person,</i>

27:36.488 --> 27:40.118
but we'll welcome you
and your items in the Netherlands

27:40.826 --> 27:42.123
at your earliest convenience."

27:51.211 --> 27:52.463
- We have to go.
- To Holland?

27:52.546 --> 27:54.259
- To the Netherlands.
- Can you stop?

27:54.339 --> 27:56.216
No, I'm not stopping until it's burned.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.677
- Warren.
- It's evidence.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.227
Hot. Motherfuck.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.273
Thank you. Sorry.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.813
So, you wanna go all the way over there,

28:06.476 --> 28:08.023
to meet some actual criminals

28:08.979 --> 28:10.151
we know nothing about,

28:11.315 --> 28:13.028
to talk about something we don't even have?

28:13.108 --> 28:14.200
Yes.

28:16.153 --> 28:17.200
What's your suggestion?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.499
Maybe it's time, you know, to face reality.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.410
Maybe it's something we're not able to do.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.541
So we're just gonna sit here and do nothing?

28:29.666 --> 28:33.591
That is so disappointing.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.431
I can't even tell you.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.844
<i>How about you, Spencer?
You keeping your game up?</i>

28:41.261 --> 28:42.808
Uh, not so much.

28:42.888 --> 28:46.563
I mean, I'm trying to take
the whole art thing seriously.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.151
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.191
Well, I guess somebody has to, huh?

28:50.979 --> 28:53.027
But, you know, you wanna keep
that blood pumping, son.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.445
And speaking of which, uh,

28:55.525 --> 28:57.239
I ran into Burt Morris last week,

28:57.319 --> 28:59.572
and he said you missed
a couple of practice games.

28:59.655 --> 29:00.907
- Yeah.
- Now, Warren,

29:01.573 --> 29:02.700
you're there on a scholarship.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.707
And that's what it means.
You're there to play.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.046
I had it the same way.

29:08.622 --> 29:09.919
- Fuck!
- Jesus Christ.

29:10.999 --> 29:11.921
You okay?

29:12.459 --> 29:14.381
Remember, quitters never win...

29:14.461 --> 29:18.135
- And winners never quit.
- Here you go, Spencer.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.467
Yeah, something to live by.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.393
So, how is your mom, Spencer?

29:22.010 --> 29:23.432
Uh, she's doing good.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.934
- Good. You tell her I said hi for me.
- I will.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.357
I need to speak with you, please.

29:28.642 --> 29:29.730
What, now, Sue?

29:29.810 --> 29:30.902
Now?

29:32.020 --> 29:33.238
Excuse me, guys.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.942
What I wanna do is just have
dinner with the boys.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.114
- What is this?
- You're holding my...

29:59.631 --> 30:00.974
I'm divorcing your father.

30:03.969 --> 30:04.891
I'm sorry.

30:07.848 --> 30:10.442
And then, I think
I looked over at Spencer, and...

30:11.935 --> 30:14.188
I mean, who knows if this is
how it really went, but he said...

30:14.271 --> 30:15.567
I remember it being like, "Whoa."

30:15.647 --> 30:16.614
I should go now.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.168
Is she fucking crying?

30:36.126 --> 30:37.503
Are you fucking crying?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.467
Warren, I'm gonna go, man.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.137
Yeah, let's go.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.594
You should chew your food, man, seriously.

31:24.591 --> 31:25.763
We're carrying on with the plan.

31:27.511 --> 31:28.512
What are you talking about?

31:29.054 --> 31:31.899
Holland. Amsterdam, and then gone.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.064
Come on, Warren, you know I can't go.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.561
Even if I wanted to.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.201
Come on, man.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.241
Fuck.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.493
Look, maybe I can, uh, find some money,

31:48.573 --> 31:51.543
and... put it towards half the ticket.

31:56.748 --> 31:57.749
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:59.376 --> 32:00.423
But...

32:01.753 --> 32:03.050
it'll be only you going.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.010
That's okay.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.765
What?

32:15.350 --> 32:16.818
- Give me a kiss.
- Don't you even touch me, man.

32:19.312 --> 32:20.655
- All right, bro.
- Thanks, brother.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.987
- Go get 'em, all right?
- Yeah.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.260

33:39.059 --> 33:39.901
Hi.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.317
You mind if I sit?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.078
You guys are the guys that we...

33:55.158 --> 33:56.330
You have some books,

33:56.993 --> 33:58.745
and you have some paintings.

34:00.789 --> 34:01.711
That I do.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.713
That I do.

34:04.668 --> 34:08.797
Now, uh, we have a number
of items pertaining to

34:09.422 --> 34:10.924
the existence, for which I'm here.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.350
Um...

34:26.106 --> 34:28.074
The books, the Audubons.

34:28.525 --> 34:29.777
They're very rare.

34:29.859 --> 34:30.951
Yes.

34:31.777 --> 34:32.824
That's why I'm here.

34:34.281 --> 34:35.408
That's why you're here

34:36.074 --> 34:37.996
with your piece of paper.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.003
Well, uh, I didn't know...

34:57.804 --> 34:59.681
Mr. Beckman is your father?

35:03.018 --> 35:05.646
No, uh, Mr. Beckman is my employer.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.251
Actually, we are kind of related.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.124
He's, uh, he's actually my...

35:22.621 --> 35:24.669
my mom's sister's husband,

35:25.081 --> 35:27.379
which makes him sort of, uh, uncle.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.341
You have authentication?

35:36.259 --> 35:38.557
Okay, when you say authentication...

35:38.637 --> 35:40.809
We take items from various sources,

35:40.889 --> 35:43.233
and we don't inquire where they came from,

35:43.933 --> 35:46.481
as long as we have authentication

35:46.561 --> 35:49.815
with a very famous auction house.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.116
Yeah, um...

35:51.608 --> 35:54.612
So, you're saying,
with the correct authentications,

35:55.570 --> 35:58.790
that these items would be of interest to you?

36:00.533 --> 36:01.455
Yeah.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.329
So...

36:05.622 --> 36:08.671
Mr. Beckman's gonna be very pleased
about this, by the way. Um...

36:09.918 --> 36:12.467
So... can I ask, roughly,

36:14.673 --> 36:16.346
in terms of, um...

36:17.217 --> 36:19.514
- It's hard, I imagine, to...
- How much?

36:19.594 --> 36:20.561
Yes.

36:21.471 --> 36:22.393
How much?

36:23.098 --> 36:25.943
Thirty to forty percent
of the valuation price.

36:26.768 --> 36:30.272
That's, um, millions of dollars, right?

36:30.605 --> 36:31.572
Yeah!

36:32.315 --> 36:35.945
Look, I've been thinking just, uh, you know,

36:36.569 --> 36:37.912
we're gonna need a bigger boat.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.245
We're gonna need a bigger boat?

36:42.325 --> 36:43.827
I mean, we're gonna need somebody else.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.212
Um...

36:52.293 --> 36:53.761
Why do we need someone else?

36:54.337 --> 36:56.590
We need somebody with skills
that we don't have.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.683
Somebody who's good with logistics,

36:59.050 --> 37:00.927
and chess.

37:01.386 --> 37:05.767
Accepted accounting... principles.

37:08.852 --> 37:09.944
Statements...

37:11.771 --> 37:13.239
on auditing.

37:13.523 --> 37:16.363
So, in 1992,

37:16.443 --> 37:18.867
we get SAS 82.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.665
Anyone dare to explain
the significance of this one?

37:24.242 --> 37:25.209
Mr. Borsuk.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.751
I was majoring in accounting
because I wanted a career at the FBI.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.170
At the time, that was only one
of the two majors

37:32.250 --> 37:33.718
they accepted straight out of college.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.171
<i>Eric was a gentleman.</i>

37:36.838 --> 37:37.885
<i>A good student.</i>

37:38.840 --> 37:42.094
Gave made no pause

37:42.177 --> 37:46.182
or concern, uh, whatsoever.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.312
I always felt like I was, um...

37:49.768 --> 37:51.270
kind of a loner for some reason.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.233
Um, yeah, um, SAS 82

37:57.066 --> 38:00.031
states that auditors have the duty
to actively look for fraud

38:00.111 --> 38:01.954
and not just report it if they find it.

38:02.864 --> 38:03.827
That's correct.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.376
Except, in reality, it doesn't
always work like that, does it?

38:08.036 --> 38:09.003
Arthur Andersen.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.919
Remember them? Auditors to Enron?

38:13.124 --> 38:15.468
Um, thank you for that, Mr. Borsuk.

38:18.213 --> 38:21.558
So, in 2002, that leads us to SAS 99...

38:23.176 --> 38:24.803
Don't cancel me.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.349
Shit! What the fuck are you doing here?

38:26.429 --> 38:27.647
I need to talk to you.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.148
But not here.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.778
Warren and I lost touch.
We had a falling out.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.363
Been about three months
since we had last spoken.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.623
I thought that we weren't speaking.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.951
What? Wait.

38:48.368 --> 38:49.995
No. Uh, no, no, no, no.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.292
Can... we just agree

38:52.372 --> 38:54.124
to put all that stupid shit
behind us, please?

38:54.207 --> 38:56.005
I mean, no.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.003
- Hey.
- So, what's up, man?

38:58.086 --> 38:59.213
What's with all the mystery?

38:59.587 --> 39:01.590
I'm here to talk to you
about something deadly serious.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.011
I figured you must want something.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.843
Actually, I came to offer you something.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.473
- Oh, really? Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.932
There's no one else I could trust with this.

39:12.141 --> 39:13.438
You're either in or you're out, right now.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.857
How can I tell you if I'm in or I'm out
without you telling me

39:15.937 --> 39:17.776
the first thing about
what I might be in or out of.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.530
I would just need you to say
"in principle," okay?

39:20.900 --> 39:23.574
Because this might be something
not exactly legal.

39:24.571 --> 39:26.164
And there's a chance

39:26.614 --> 39:28.286
that we would have
to leave everything behind.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.788
Okay, when you say "not legal"...

39:30.577 --> 39:33.422
I'm gonna say this one time,
and one time only.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.126
You're either in or you're out. Right now.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.506
- I'm gonna need more than this, Warren.
- Not till you commit.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.546
This would be something dangerous,

39:42.630 --> 39:43.927
and very fucking exciting,

39:45.258 --> 39:47.556
that I need you to be a part of.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.393
This could change everything.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.896
This is your red pill
or blue pill moment, my friend.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.406
How's college?

40:08.740 --> 40:09.992
Would we have to go tonight?

40:10.742 --> 40:13.086
I think I was just saying yes,
because I knew that

40:14.162 --> 40:15.584
I wanted to, um...

40:17.415 --> 40:19.258
regain our friendship more than anything.

40:24.714 --> 40:25.715
So what's your plan?

40:25.798 --> 40:28.513
This is partly where you come in.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.971
Just take a look for me, please.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.981
- It can't be done at night.
- What?

40:38.061 --> 40:40.610
What's the one time of day when
no one's supposed to be in the building?

40:41.898 --> 40:44.367
It'd be impossible to get in
without triggering the alarms.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.070
It would have to be done during the day.

40:50.531 --> 40:51.578
You see?

40:52.492 --> 40:53.830
I knew you were the man for this.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.498
Look at him. Just like a fish in water.

40:55.578 --> 40:56.454
Sure.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.795
Let's just walk in there
in broad daylight and rob the place.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.465
Oh, yeah, while... while you're at it,
you're gonna dynamite the canteen, right?

41:05.672 --> 41:08.346
How many cameras did you say
were in the special collections room?

41:08.967 --> 41:11.890
Because they're gonna be watching
everything from the campus safety office.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.847
The cameras, the alarms.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.398
They're gonna know who's coming in and out.

41:16.808 --> 41:17.684
What are you doing?

41:19.143 --> 41:20.565
I'm taking notes. This is good stuff.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.022
Are you fucking retarded?

41:22.730 --> 41:23.572
No.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.195
Why don't you just email the FBI and ask them

41:26.275 --> 41:27.527
where they'd like us
to leave our fingerprints?

41:27.610 --> 41:28.577
You can make it easy for them.

41:29.946 --> 41:33.701
Guys, we need to find out who's watching
the special collections room and when.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.208
I concur with that.

41:42.959 --> 41:43.881
Come in.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.756
Hey.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.967
- Take a seat, Warren.
- Okay.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.646
I assume you know why you're here.

41:56.597 --> 41:57.473
Uh...

41:58.850 --> 41:59.726
Not really, sir.

42:00.727 --> 42:01.945
Right. Mr. Lipka...

42:03.312 --> 42:06.737
you came here on an athletic scholarship.

42:07.191 --> 42:11.116
Perhaps it doesn't seem
like a particularly big deal to you.

42:12.488 --> 42:14.035
No, sir, it does.

42:14.115 --> 42:15.788
Well, son, you have
a funny way of showing it.

42:16.909 --> 42:19.248
Because I warned you countless times

42:19.328 --> 42:22.332
what would happen
if you continue to fail to show up.

42:22.415 --> 42:26.340
Assistant coach suspects drugs
or alcohol may be involved.

42:29.464 --> 42:32.468
Now... it pains me

42:32.550 --> 42:34.678
to see you lose this scholarship.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.972
But it's gonna pain

42:38.056 --> 42:41.731
and probably embarrass your father
a whole lot more.

42:43.019 --> 42:44.482
So you might wanna reflect on

42:44.562 --> 42:46.781
what that kind of disappointment
will mean for him.

42:50.359 --> 42:51.360
Yeah.

42:53.362 --> 42:54.739
That will be a disappointment.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.535
Thing is...

43:01.329 --> 43:03.798
I worked to get on that team
since I was about five.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.345
And I have absolutely no idea why.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.216
To be honest, sir...

43:14.967 --> 43:17.345
I think this whole place is a disappointment.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.522
I think you're a disappointment.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.273
And I think this whole goddamn town

43:29.941 --> 43:31.193
is a disappointment.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.204
Get out.

43:47.750 --> 43:48.626
Is that it?

43:55.258 --> 43:56.476
<i>The cameras aren't cameras.</i>

43:57.343 --> 43:58.561
<i>They're motion detectors.</i>

43:59.095 --> 44:00.847
<i>We're gonna email the library,</i>

44:00.930 --> 44:04.771
asking to have the <i>Audubon</i>
and the illuminated manuscript

44:04.851 --> 44:06.228
on display when we arrive.

44:07.061 --> 44:09.025
They will be here and here.

44:09.105 --> 44:11.859
Can you please not touch the model? Thanks.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.944
As I was saying.

44:15.653 --> 44:19.283
Back here is target priority number one,
the <i>Audubon.</i>

44:19.824 --> 44:22.497
Now, directly behind the display case
is a doorway

44:22.577 --> 44:25.422
which leads to a staff elevator
that goes straight to the basement.

44:26.122 --> 44:28.044
Now, once in the basement,

44:28.124 --> 44:31.173
we can access the fire exit
at the side of the building.

44:35.047 --> 44:36.594
Uh, where's the librarian?

44:38.176 --> 44:39.303
- Thank you.
- Just watch it.

44:40.761 --> 44:44.857
The librarian is the single biggest risk
to this entire operation.

44:47.143 --> 44:49.567
She needs to become a non-factor
as soon as possible.

44:57.403 --> 44:59.617
Now, once inside the room,

44:59.697 --> 45:01.324
you two will bag up the smaller books,

45:01.908 --> 45:04.787
and I'll unlock the cases
containing the Audubon and the Darwin.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.834
We should be in and out
in less than three or four minutes.

45:07.914 --> 45:09.666
- Good afternoon. Come in.
- How are you?

45:09.749 --> 45:10.750
I'm Betty Jean Gooch,

45:10.833 --> 45:13.052
and I will need your names
for the log, please.

45:13.502 --> 45:15.129
I am, uh, Spencer Green.

45:29.435 --> 45:32.610
<i># A little less conversation
A little more action, please #</i>

45:33.648 --> 45:36.652
<i># All this aggravation
Ain't satisfactioning me #</i>

45:37.777 --> 45:39.654
<i># A little more bite

45:39.946 --> 45:41.742
<i># A little less fight

45:41.822 --> 45:43.244
<i># Close your mouth

45:43.324 --> 45:44.746
<i># And, baby, satisfy me #</i>

45:45.993 --> 45:47.211
<i># Satisfy me, baby #</i>

45:48.537 --> 45:50.414
<i># Come on, baby
I'm tired of talking #</i>

45:52.792 --> 45:54.840
<i># Grab your coat

45:57.046 --> 45:58.764
<i># Come on, come on
Come on, come on #</i>

45:59.257 --> 46:00.804
<i># Come on, come on
Come on, come on #</i>

46:01.384 --> 46:02.931
<i># Come on, come on
Come on, come on #</i>

46:03.469 --> 46:05.516
<i># Don't procrastinate
Don't articulate #</i>

46:05.596 --> 46:08.975
<i># Girl, it's getting late
You just sit and wait around #</i>

46:09.058 --> 46:11.230
<i># Yeah
A little less conversation #</i>

46:11.310 --> 46:12.983
<i># A little more action
Please #</i>

46:14.063 --> 46:16.566
<i># All this aggravation
Ain't satisfactioning me #</i>

46:16.649 --> 46:17.776
Stop.

46:18.359 --> 46:19.201
Wait.

46:19.443 --> 46:20.444
Doesn't work.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.740
We need two guys, at least, in the room.

46:23.823 --> 46:24.950
Then you need a third guy,

46:25.032 --> 46:27.251
downstairs in the library keeping lookout.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.124
Then, we're gonna have to have
a getaway driver.

46:30.204 --> 46:31.251
Who's your driver?

46:32.748 --> 46:34.751
- The three of us isn't enough.
- He's right.

46:35.001 --> 46:37.004
I just wanna see
how any of this is gonna work.

46:37.086 --> 46:40.135
I mean, does this seem realistic or...

46:41.966 --> 46:43.639
Well, you got a better idea, Spence?

46:45.511 --> 46:47.229
No. Fuck.

46:49.682 --> 46:54.899
I was torn between the desire
to keep the adventure going,

46:54.979 --> 46:58.028
and waiting for the insurmountable
obstacle that would...

46:59.150 --> 47:03.030
stop everything in its tracks
and return things to normal.

47:03.487 --> 47:05.201
We need someone else that we can trust.

47:05.281 --> 47:07.033
Wait, wait, wait. Someone else?

47:08.534 --> 47:09.911
You wanna bring in someone else?

47:10.703 --> 47:11.795
You got a better idea?

47:15.458 --> 47:16.630
Who else can we trust with this?

47:17.752 --> 47:19.049
Someone with a fast car.

47:20.087 --> 47:21.088
Or the money to get one.

47:46.155 --> 47:49.455
<i>I'd only met him a couple
of times in high school.</i>

47:51.452 --> 47:54.080
I'd never really got along
too well with Chas.

47:54.163 --> 47:57.508
The decision to bring on
the fourth person came from Eric.

47:57.833 --> 47:59.297
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was Warren's idea.

47:59.377 --> 48:02.381
I definitely wouldn't have
ever suggested we bring Chas on.

48:04.340 --> 48:07.719
My name is Charles Thomas Allen ll,
but people call me Chas.

48:08.969 --> 48:10.846
<i>My dad built me for success.</i>

48:11.305 --> 48:14.353
<i>I started my first company at 12 years old.</i>

48:14.433 --> 48:17.356
At 16, bought my first rental property.

48:17.436 --> 48:20.315
He's been a little entrepreneur,
as long as I can remember.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.733
You know, mowing grass, uh...

48:23.234 --> 48:24.780
You know, he followed his dad around.

48:24.860 --> 48:25.948
He was a little Tom.

48:26.028 --> 48:27.825
He just followed him around all the time,

48:27.905 --> 48:29.532
wanting to be, you know,

48:29.615 --> 48:32.288
business and, you know,
do everything his dad did.

48:32.368 --> 48:35.668
Chas, interestingly enough, I knew his dad.

48:36.247 --> 48:39.842
Uh, he worked out at the same gym
that I did for a while.

48:40.376 --> 48:42.379
Just a wonderful person.

48:43.295 --> 48:47.596
Uh, you know, I mean,
a prince of an individual.

48:48.551 --> 48:49.973
I think the qualities that...

48:50.719 --> 48:53.268
we thought Chas could bring was money.

49:00.187 --> 49:02.026
Jesus fucking Christ, Warren.

49:02.106 --> 49:03.699
- Stop doing that shit.
- Sorry.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.409
Sorry, man.

49:06.485 --> 49:07.782
Can we talk to you about something?

49:08.154 --> 49:09.155
Yeah, what's up?

49:09.238 --> 49:12.578
<i>Once I realized they were
serious about the plan,</i>

49:12.658 --> 49:15.412
I thought they were smoking too much.

49:15.703 --> 49:17.375
I think you guys are smoking too much...

49:17.455 --> 49:20.878
And I thought they're likely
to get themselves

49:20.958 --> 49:22.460
in a lot of trouble and get caught.

49:22.543 --> 49:25.466
...and likely to get yourselves
in a lot of trouble,

49:25.546 --> 49:26.422
and get caught.

49:26.505 --> 49:27.848
- Chas?
- Mm-hmm?

49:29.008 --> 49:31.386
You really need to see
how easy this is gonna be.

49:34.763 --> 49:37.061
Wait. What the fuck are you guys
even talking about here?

49:37.141 --> 49:41.613
We're talking about $12 million
in rare books.

49:42.229 --> 49:44.152
And only one old lady guarding it.

49:51.405 --> 49:52.748
Names first.

49:53.574 --> 49:55.076
Eric, Mr. Black.

49:55.159 --> 49:56.832
Spencer, Mr. Green.

49:57.161 --> 49:58.458
Mr. Yellow, that's me.

49:59.205 --> 50:01.253
Chas, Mr. Pink.

50:04.251 --> 50:05.252
Fucking really, dude?

50:05.336 --> 50:07.384
- What?
- You're making me Mr. Pink?

50:08.172 --> 50:10.594
What? What's wrong with Mr. Pink?

50:10.674 --> 50:13.428
You know exactly what's wrong
with Mr. Pink, okay?

50:14.178 --> 50:16.517
I'm sorry, can I just say
how dumb this entire thing is?

50:16.597 --> 50:18.099
Okay? Because in the motion picture,

50:18.557 --> 50:20.184
the whole point of the names
was so that nobody knew

50:20.267 --> 50:22.481
what the others were called,
so they couldn't give each other up.

50:22.561 --> 50:24.188
Relax, okay?

50:24.271 --> 50:25.484
It's just protocol,

50:25.564 --> 50:28.033
so we don't address each other
by our names during the robbery.

50:28.859 --> 50:29.951
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.244
No names.

50:31.737 --> 50:33.576
- Mr. Pink.
- It's fucking ridiculous, man.

50:33.656 --> 50:35.369
Didn't they all die in the end of that movie?

50:35.449 --> 50:38.669
<i>Spencer was Mr. Green,
because he smoked lots of green.</i>

50:39.703 --> 50:42.582
<i>Eric was Mr. Black,
because he said his soul was black.</i>

50:43.541 --> 50:47.136
I was Mr. Yellow because I was...
I was my mom's sunshine.

50:47.836 --> 50:51.716
And I named Chas Mr. Pink
just to fuck with him.

50:51.799 --> 50:54.803
I'm not gonna be Mr. Pink.
I'd be any color but pink.

50:57.054 --> 50:58.681
It's probably my least favorite
Tarantino film.

50:58.764 --> 51:01.479
Okay. Housekeeping first.

51:01.559 --> 51:04.233
Mr. Green, you will see to the disguises.

51:04.603 --> 51:07.231
Makeup, prosthetics, outfits, wigs, etcetera.

51:08.816 --> 51:11.238
- Costume party?
- Making a movie.

51:11.318 --> 51:15.284
Mr. Black, your first task
is to find a reliable getaway vehicle.

51:15.364 --> 51:17.453
<i>A Ford or similar, nothing flashy.</i>

51:17.533 --> 51:18.746
Which you will purchase

51:18.826 --> 51:21.165
- using cash and a fake ID.
- Yeah, thank you.

51:21.245 --> 51:25.336
Mr. Pink, your first job
is to identify the quickest route

51:25.416 --> 51:28.386
from the library to the drop off point, here.

51:28.877 --> 51:32.757
<i>I mean, practice it over and over again
until it becomes second nature.</i>

51:44.310 --> 51:46.938
14 minutes, 18 seconds, mostly green lights.

51:47.354 --> 51:49.903
Mr. Yellow. That's me, of course.

51:50.399 --> 51:53.822
I will make the authentication appointment
in New York for the weekend,

51:53.902 --> 51:55.370
immediately following the robbery.

51:55.738 --> 51:58.536
<i>Meaning, that even if the books
are reported missing,</i>

51:58.616 --> 52:01.290
<i>they won't yet show up
on the national index of stolen art.</i>

52:03.412 --> 52:05.251
<i>Once we have the authentication,</i>

52:05.331 --> 52:08.676
<i>we will arrange a rendezvous
with the buyers in the Netherlands.</i>

52:11.795 --> 52:14.219
<i>Dear sir, my name is Walter Beckman.</i>

52:14.840 --> 52:17.184
<i>I'm a collector of rare manuscripts,
based in Texas.</i>

52:17.801 --> 52:20.646
<i>I would like to arrange an appraisal
of some of the items in my collection.</i>

52:21.472 --> 52:22.314
Now...

52:23.182 --> 52:25.271
I have emailed the library
to make an appointment

52:25.351 --> 52:27.775
to view the books
on the penultimate day of term.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.026
That's eight days from now.

52:31.148 --> 52:32.616
The library will be almost empty,

52:33.400 --> 52:34.572
as everyone will be in finals.

52:34.652 --> 52:35.990
I have an exam that day.

52:36.070 --> 52:39.159
- Me too.
- Yeah, me too, I have art history.

52:39.239 --> 52:40.366
Exactly.

52:41.075 --> 52:42.247
What do you mean "exactly"?

52:42.868 --> 52:44.495
I mean, who's gonna suspect
a group of robbers

52:44.578 --> 52:45.955
who all happen to be in exams that day?

52:49.500 --> 52:51.969
Mr. Green, would you like
to walk us through the disguises?

52:52.628 --> 52:56.758
So, the idea is,
we go in disguised as old men.

52:56.840 --> 52:58.888
I'm sorry. Why the fuck would
we go disguised as old men?

52:59.259 --> 53:02.604
Because, being old
is the closest thing to being invisible.

53:03.555 --> 53:04.602
I have a question.

53:05.516 --> 53:08.110
I'm still unclear on what's
gonna happen with the librarian.

53:08.352 --> 53:10.774
- Who's gonna be doing...
- We should probably decide that

53:10.854 --> 53:13.357
by drawing lots or a vote or something.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.487
Well, I vote to have nothing
to do with it whatsoever.

53:15.567 --> 53:17.990
Yeah, me too. I don't wanna do that.
I'm not gonna.

53:18.070 --> 53:20.242
Hey. Whoa. What the fuck?

53:20.322 --> 53:22.996
Obviously, nobody wants to do it.
That's why we need to decide it by...

53:23.409 --> 53:24.872
drawing lots or a vote or something.

53:24.952 --> 53:26.329
Isn't there maybe a...

53:27.579 --> 53:30.549
a way to make her not be there on the day?

53:31.166 --> 53:33.419
No. Of course, there isn't a fucking way.

53:33.502 --> 53:35.591
That's how you get to be in the room.
Someone has to be in there with you.

53:35.671 --> 53:37.343
That's how you get to be in the fucking room!

53:37.423 --> 53:38.800
What if she starts screaming or something?

53:38.882 --> 53:40.679
Yeah, or has a fucking heart attack, man.

53:40.759 --> 53:41.597
Yeah.

53:41.677 --> 53:43.179
Guys, when this is all over,

53:43.262 --> 53:44.889
we're gonna send her an anonymous package

53:44.972 --> 53:46.975
filled with thousands of fucking dollars.

53:47.516 --> 53:49.268
- She's gonna be happy.
- Look, I'm not doing it.

53:49.893 --> 53:50.735
Okay?

53:51.145 --> 53:52.363
I'm not comfortable with it.

54:03.198 --> 54:04.165
Wow.

54:16.336 --> 54:17.178
Fuck it.

54:20.924 --> 54:21.766
I'll do it.

54:24.887 --> 54:25.934
I'll fucking do it.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.270
<i>There was no obstacle.</i>

54:30.392 --> 54:32.269
<i>Nothing was gonna prevent us from doing it.</i>

54:33.937 --> 54:36.110
<i>We had started it, and it could be done.</i>

54:40.486 --> 54:45.037
There were so many opportunities,
looking back, where I could have...

54:46.450 --> 54:48.874
completely,
that I could have gotten out, or...

54:50.579 --> 54:53.924
Or change what we were doing.
And... and I didn't.

55:02.591 --> 55:04.184
- Duct tape.
- Check.

55:05.511 --> 55:07.514
- Change of clothes.
- Check.

55:07.596 --> 55:08.973
- Sheet.
- Check.

55:09.515 --> 55:11.311
- Ski masks.
- Ski masks.

55:11.391 --> 55:12.438
Cell phones.

55:13.101 --> 55:14.068
Zip ties.

55:15.395 --> 55:16.817
- Taser.
- Check

55:17.815 --> 55:18.691
No taser.

55:19.566 --> 55:20.567
Shit!

55:21.068 --> 55:22.614
Whose job was it to order the taser?

55:22.694 --> 55:24.037
I believe it was your job.

55:25.906 --> 55:27.408
Fuck it, I can't think of everything.

55:43.799 --> 55:44.891
Open your books.

55:45.425 --> 55:49.305
You have two hours to complete
two of the three essay questions.

55:49.388 --> 55:52.060
When I give the signal,
you may turn over your papers.

55:52.140 --> 55:53.854
Any problems, raise your hand.

55:53.934 --> 55:54.855
And begin.

55:54.935 --> 55:56.437
<i># Blood in the streets

- Don't you have exams today?
- Yeah.

56:23.964 --> 56:25.466
Uh, hey, listen, I gotta borrow the van.

56:30.929 --> 56:34.354
Pencils down. Close your tests
and exit the room.

56:34.933 --> 56:38.153
Your scores will be posted
by the end of next week.

56:48.864 --> 56:50.582
You're seven minutes late. Let's go!

57:11.762 --> 57:12.729
<i>Time's up.</i>

57:13.430 --> 57:15.524
Pens down. Close your books.

57:15.849 --> 57:17.772
Please pass them to your left,

57:18.268 --> 57:20.362
and leave in an orderly fashion.

Eleven minutes.

Don't even fucking think about
throwing up in this car, Spencer.

Remember, you're old.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.660
- There's people everywhere.
- Just stick to the plan.

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:25.498
Let's do this.

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:29.921
Abort, abort.

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:32.086
- Abort.
- What? Why?

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.599
There's four fucking librarians up there
having some kind of meeting or something.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:46.680
I don't know, I can't...

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.185
- I can't do it.
- Who's up there, all right?

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.268
- There's a man...
- It doesn't matter who's up there.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.188
There's four of them.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.190
We're not gonna tie up
four fucking librarians.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.362
What's going on?

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.356
There's a fucking meeting
up there or something, okay?

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.403
There's four librarians.
We can't tie up all of these people.

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.656
I'm not... I'm not staying, okay?
They're all looking at me.

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:02.488
I'm losing a sideburn.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:05.157
Okay, listen. Everyone,
just chill out, all right?

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.828
We haven't done anything.
We can wait, all right?

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.330
They're not gonna be up there forever.

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:12.923
Okay. Who wants to wait?

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.970

- Man.

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:17.445
The plan was off,
there was gonna be no heist.

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.485
And it was glorious. The sun was shining,

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:23.034
and it was like a new... a new beginning.

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:30.617

After all that, that's it.
That's the end of it. It's over.

Did you fucking think?

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.677
- To call me fucking...
- I'm tired of all this shit.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:42.504
Fuck!

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:46.761
Maybe we dodged a bullet.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:49.811
We didn't dodge anything,
'cause we didn't fucking do anything.

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:51.725
We just fucked it up.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:53.352
Fuck!

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.233

I just called the library.

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:38.610
We're back on. Tomorrow morning, 11:00 a.m.

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:41.396
She says there are
no other appointments scheduled.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:46.117
Whoo!

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:06.800
You rang the theater?

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.258
I guess you didn't realize how bad it was.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.805
I guess you just never know
how you're gonna react

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:12.886
in a situation like that.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:15.392
Wait, what? She let
her husband practically die

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.349
because she didn't wanna
interrupt the concert?

01:06:17.432 --> 01:06:19.856
Maybe she just never
really liked him all that much.

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:22.650
Well, not everybody
has the presence of mind...

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.952
You okay, sweetie?

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.326
- Not hungry?
- I'm just tired.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.161
Exams and stuff.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:36.250
Honey, you gotta take
better care of yourself.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:40.463
Are you sure you're okay?

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:41.919
Yeah.

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:47.842
I just, uh, I just remembered,
I have an exam tomorrow.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.632
I didn't study for it, so...

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.929
- You okay, champ?
- Spencer.

01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:00.229
<i>All limitations are self-imposed.</i>

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:03.277
Warren.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:11.407
- Warren.
- What? What the fuck, man?

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:13.826
I'm done.

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:15.539
I'm done.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:17.621
I can't see it ending well.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.627
I just can't go back in there.

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.755
Okay, well, just... all right.

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.717
Look, today was bad luck.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.128
But we got a trial run, okay?

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:29.758
Now, we can make adjustments, and...

01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:32.090
Dude, nothing bad is gonna happen.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:34.635
- Nobody's gonna get hurt,
- Stop saying that, Warren!

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:35.638
"No one's gonna get hurt."

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.220
How do you know no one's gonna get hurt?

01:07:37.762 --> 01:07:39.514
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:42.184
I'm talking about my family, okay?

01:07:44.519 --> 01:07:46.567
They're good people
and they don't deserve it.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.240
Have you even thought about... I mean...

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.406
What could happen, like,
if it goes wrong, with our futures?

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:55.784
Which fucking future are you worried about?

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:59.785
The one that's fucking indistinguishable
from everyone else's?

01:07:59.867 --> 01:08:01.369
Where you fucking beaver away

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:02.916
to get the shit you're told you need to have

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:04.918
by some fucking asshole who's gonna tell you

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:07.217
what a great big success you are
once you get it all?

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:10.420
Spence, you are the one
who wanted to fucking change.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:12.471
You started this whole thing, remember?

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.598
- Huh?
- Yeah, I do.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:21.098
But, I think we should just quit
while we're ahead.

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:24.475
Dude, this isn't fucking ahead.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.773
This is just more of the same shit.

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.947
Nothing has changed. What has changed?

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.149
Tell me.

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:39.866
I'm just not cut out for it, Warren.

01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:44.246
Okay? I'm not cut out for it, so I'm not...

01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:46.497
I'm done.

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:47.924
- Look, you just...
- I'm done.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:51.006
You really wanna come all this way...

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.966
and not find out what happens next?

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:03.560
I mean, tell me this hasn't been
the time of your fucking life.

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.854
Man, I don't want you waking up,

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:12.107
ten years from now

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:14.567
wondering what could've happened.

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:18.078
And who you could've been.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:24.622
Fine.

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:28.372
I'll see you around, man.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:37.174
One day, you'll be dead!

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:45.745
<i>You can go through life,</i>

01:10:45.825 --> 01:10:48.579
with this expectation that something...

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.416
fantastic is gonna happen,

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:54.046
something life-altering that's gonna make
your life different and unique.

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:06.263
<i>I realized that I had to...</i>

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.483
actually make something happen on my own.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.022
So, plan B.

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:18.783
We've agreed that Chas will be the driver.

01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:21.741
He stays in the van with the engine
running and the doors open.

01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:23.908
Myself and Eric

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:25.865
will be the only ones
to go inside the library.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:28.496
No disguises.
It just creates unwanted attention.

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:29.623
What about him?

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:33.836
Spencer will be outside on lookout.

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:36.504
- What, why?
- Well, he can't go inside.

01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:39.006
People will recognize him.
We can't risk that.

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:41.676
So, then who's gonna be
the lookout inside the library?

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:43.970
You. You're gonna be downstairs

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.722
until I call you to come bag up the books.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:48.391
You know that I can't be involved
in dealing with the librarian, right?

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:50.184
- You get that?
- Like I said,

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:51.728
I will take care of that,

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:54.482
and then I will call you once she's been...

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.280
She's neutralized.

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:03.445
This time, it's gonna work.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.747
Okay, so, when I go up,

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:09.705
she'll be dealt with. It'll be done?

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.170
Yes, Warren?

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:15.418
It's what I just said.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:16.999
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:17.704
- Mr. Beckman.
- Yes, hi. Walter Beckman.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.750
Yes, Betty Jean Gooch. Nice to see you.

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:21.252
- Nice to see you, too.
- Come in, please.

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:25.212
I have to say, I expected someone much older.

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:28.386
Yeah, you never know, do you?

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:30.466
No, you never know.

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:34.562
Now, I'm gonna ask you
to sign in for the log,

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.517
by your printed name.

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:41.152
- Right there, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:43.195
And then, if you would date it, please.

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:46.987
<i>And how is your day going thus far?</i>

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:49.196
It's going fine, thank you.

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:51.870
Um, I'm very sorry about the other evening.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.198
Uh, the other day, sorry.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:57.330
We, uh... I had a family emergency
I had to take care of.

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:58.706
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:00.789
- Yeah.
- I trust everything is okay.

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.589
- It's okay now, thank you.
- Good.

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:05.794
Well, what you have requested to see,

01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:09.005
uh, are among our most treasured items.

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:12.094
I have laid out the illuminated manuscript

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:15.394
and the <i>Hortus Sanitatis</i> on my left.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.473
Please remember to use
the gloves at all times

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:20.684
while touching any of the pages.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:22.439
Sure.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:27.109
Uh, is this a personal interest of yours,

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.487
or are you working on some kind of a project?

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:32.783
Uh, I just, um,
heard a great deal about them.

01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:34.580
Ah.

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:39.627
Well, as you can see, one of the volumes
of the Audubon is displayed here.

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.664
This case will remain locked at all times.

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:45.795
However, if you do wish to see
some of the other plates,

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:49.629
I can help you to turn some
of the pages, if time permits.

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:20.664
You can come up now.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.842
Ms. Gooch, uh, my friend, he's right there.

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:18.892
Oh.

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:21.387
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:35.735
Hello. Come in, please.

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.999
I will need your name for the log book.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.709
You need to sign in, John.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:46.329
John.

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:50.336
John...

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.462
- Rutherford.
- Rutherford.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:00.679
Please sign by the...

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:02.887
Oh, shit! What are you doing?

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:06.769
No, no, no! That's hurting me!

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:08.852
- I'm sorry. Just relax, all right?
- No, I can't. I got to get out.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:10.561
We're here for the books.
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:12.396
Just relax.
This will all be over in a second.

01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:14.573
No, no, I can't.

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:17.485
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:19.404
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:21.408
You keep struggling,
it's gonna fucking hurt more.

01:18:21.488 --> 01:18:22.576
Shut up!

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:24.158
- Oh, God.
- Zip-tie her legs.

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:25.914
Oh, God, help me.

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:30.422
Zip-tie her fucking legs right now!

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:34.378
Don't tie my hands. Please, I can't...

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.554
- I can't have my hands tied.
- Goddamn it.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:39.803
- God, help me.
- Shit. Shit.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.054
Drop the fucking gloves. What are you doing?

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:44.181
- I just wanna go.
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:47.891
- Just relax, all right?
- I can't breathe. You're hurting me.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.941
I'm not fucking hurting... Oh, shit.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:54.942
- Fuck!
- Why? Why are you doing this?

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:56.235
- Why?
- It's the books.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:57.282
We want the books.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:18:58.783
Not you.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.783
You good? You good?

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:12.377
Fuck.

01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:18.884
Find the keys.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:20.848
Find the fucking keys!

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:22.345
Wake the fuck up!

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.101
There's no keys.

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:33.606
- What?
- There's no keys.

01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:34.687
There's no fucking keys.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.567
- I can't find any fucking key.
- Find the fucking key!

01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:38.319
- Goddamn it.
- There's no fucking keys.

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:40.117
Get the fucking door. Get it out of the case.

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:52.329
Shit!

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:55.253
Fuck.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:24.570
That's it.

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:42.964
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:48.761
Get the fucking books, right now.

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:53.690
What the fuck?

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.649
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
She's moving towards the door.

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:00.693
I'm not fucking touching her.

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:02.361
I'm done touching her. That's it.

01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:04.819
- Fuck, I'm trying to get the thing out.
- I'm not touching her anymore!

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:05.990
- I'm done.
- Goddamn it,

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:07.783
- I gotta do everything my fucking self.
- I don't give a fuck.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:09.035
I'm not fucking touching her anymore.

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:14.745
All right, that's it.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:23.379
Shut the fuck up.

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:27.971
Shut the fuck up!

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.807
I'm sorry, okay? We're in and out.

01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:39.771
I got it! I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:55.960
Let's go.

01:21:58.122 --> 01:21:59.214
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:14.224
Fucking wrap this up.

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:16.181
Wait, we need another one. Another one.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:18.814
What the fuck are you talking about?
This shit could be the fucking thing.

01:22:19.143 --> 01:22:20.314
Leave it. Fucking leave it.

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:22.358
- What the fuck, man?
- It's fucking good enough.

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:23.484
This is good enough.

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:25.441
- The Darwin. Get the Darwin.
- No, fuck the Darwin, man.

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:27.112
- Fucking leave the Darwin, man.
- Yeah. Fuck.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:29.570
This is fucking gold, man.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:08.276
Hit B, hit B.

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:13.489
What the fuck?

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:15.324
- You hit one?
- Oh, fuck!

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:16.659
You hit one!

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:17.869
Fuck.

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:19.836
It might not be bad.

01:23:28.545 --> 01:23:29.763
The fuck.

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:31.764
This is bad, man.

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:33.426
Oh, this is really bad.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.265
Oh.

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:41.893
What the fuck?

01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:43.898
- Wait here. Hold the door.
- It's pitch-black. Fuck.

01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:48.653
Goddamn it, Warren.
This isn't supposed to be like this.

01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:51.611
Oh, shit. Where's the exit?

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:54.324
This is really bad.

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:57.283
- Fuck!
- This is really fucking bad, Warren.

01:23:57.824 --> 01:23:59.326
Oh, shit!

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:02.254
Fuck! Fuck!

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:03.876
Where's the fucking exit?

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:05.378
- I don't know!
- Huh?

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:09.803
What the fuck? What are we gonna do?

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:11.676
- We have to make a run for it.
- What?

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:14.052
- We gotta make a run for it.
- What do you mean, "make a run for it"?

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:16.180
- We need to make a fucking run for it.
- They're gonna fucking see us.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.973
- We have no choice.
- Fuck, man...

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:19.475
- We have no choice.
- ...this is bad.

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:21.731
This is so fucking bad.

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.111
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:42.915
No! No!

01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:44.041
- Keep fucking going.
- No!

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:45.334
Fucking leave it. Go.

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.212
- Go!
- Oh, fuck!

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:51.379
Oh, shit!

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:55.007
Warren, what the fuck are you doing?

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.222
Shit.

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:01.977
Hey, stop! Fucking idiot, stop!

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:06.939
Fucking go, go, go, go.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:09.147
Hey, Eric, where are the books, huh?

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.361
Where the fuck is Warren?

01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:14.569
Hey!

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:18.780
Holy fuck.

01:25:28.206 --> 01:25:30.425
Drive. Drive, drive, drive!

01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:38.554
Jesus Christ!

01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:42.896
- Fucking drive.
- Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.269
Slow down. You gotta fucking cool it.

01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:46.645
Don't tell me what to fucking do.

01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:49.444
- Oh, man, oh, man.
- Where are the books, Warren?

01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:52.105
- Fuck.
- Warren, where are the fucking books?

01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:53.407
We dropped the fucking books!

01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:55.237
Okay, Chas? There's no fucking books!

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.739
- What are you telling me? We got nothing?
- We fucking dropped them!

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.696
- They fell out of our hands.
- We got fucking nothing.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.077
Nothing, there's nothing. Shut the fuck up!

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:03.620
- Hey, fuck you, man.
- Please.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.789
If you got nothing,
why did you take so long up there?

01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:07.337
What the fuck happened up there, man?

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:10.669
You know, fuck the both of you.
You guys fucked this up again.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:13.088
I knew it, I knew you were
gonna fucking do this again.

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:15.171
You didn't fucking go in there.

01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:17.631
I have the Darwin. I have the Darwin.

01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:19.175
Who do you got?

01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:22.055
- Oh, gee.
- Eric, what do you fucking got?

01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:23.887
Please, give me a fucking second, please.

01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:25.847
Your fucking backpack, man. Check it!

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.492
What's he got? He got something?

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:46.243
Yeah.

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:11.521
What are you doing?

01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:12.939
- Get out.
- What?

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:15.359
What are you fucking talking about?
I'm not getting out of the fucking car.

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:16.860
Dude, they're gonna be looking for a gray van

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.487
with three guys in it, okay? Get out.

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:20.864
- What the fuck is this, man?
- Get the fuck out, man!

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:23.742
Hey, I'm not moving this car
with the three of us in it. Get out!

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:25.035
- I'm not getting out of here...
- Get out!

01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:27.618
I'll come back for you.
I will come back for you in my car.

01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:29.289
- Just get the fuck out.
- You fucking promise?

01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:30.707
I swear to fucking God I'll come back.

01:27:30.787 --> 01:27:32.790
- I'm not getting out...
- Get out! Get out!

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:35.671
Eric, get the fuck out of the fucking door!

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:37.879
Get the fuck... Get the fuck out.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.343
- Get the...
- All right!

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:42.891
Please take your fucking bag.

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:45.056
Close the fucking doors. Hurry the fuck up.

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:51.729
Fuck.

01:28:24.174 --> 01:28:25.387
Okay.

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:27.806
You gotta watch this, okay, buddy?
Fucking guard this.

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:30.184
Give me your clothes.
Give me your fucking clothes.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.538
You can't stay here, okay?

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.498
Get your shit. Let's fucking go.

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:50.910
Get it together. Let's go.

01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:02.466
<i>There is a special collection room
inside of this library.</i>

01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:04.924
<i>Now, we're told that some
of the books inside that room</i>

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.758
<i>date back to the 1700s.</i>

01:29:07.092 --> 01:29:08.935
<i>They're very rare and expensive.</i>

01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:11.391
<i>This morning, two men took advantage of that.</i>

01:29:11.471 --> 01:29:14.850
<i>This is Dave Wachinski reporting
from Transylvania University,</i>

01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:17.898
<i>where the audacious robbery
was carried out in broad daylight...</i>

01:29:17.978 --> 01:29:19.480
- Listen to this.
- Shh. Turn it up.

01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:21.440
<i>...forced their way into
the special collections room,</i>

01:29:21.815 --> 01:29:23.988
<i>home to some of America's
most valuable books.</i>

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:27.157
<i>Police say the group knew exactly
what they were looking for.</i>

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:30.535
<i>Officials are helping police search
for the two men who stole the books,</i>

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:32.663
<i>and the two men who drove
the getaway vehicle.</i>

01:29:33.326 --> 01:29:35.040
- How did they know there were four of us?
- Quiet!

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:39.876
<i>...as a gray Dodge mini-van,
license plate number 331094.</i>

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:42.255
- <i>Police are appealing for...</i>
- They got nothing on us.

01:29:42.335 --> 01:29:44.884
- How did they know there were four of us?
- They don't know shit.

01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:47.969
They have plates from a different car.

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:50.472
<i>...they violently restrained
a female librarian,</i>

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:51.895
<i>leaving her bound...</i>

01:30:36.389 --> 01:30:37.356
Okay?

01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:43.105
<i>Absolutely stunning, aren't they?</i>

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:47.280
And did Mister...

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:49.489
Beckman.

01:30:49.569 --> 01:30:52.117
Did Mr. Beckman give you any information

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:53.910
regarding the provenance of the books?

01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:56.955
Only that he inherited them many years ago,

01:30:57.035 --> 01:31:00.750
uh, and wishes to realize their value
through a private sale.

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:01.797
Right.

01:31:06.753 --> 01:31:08.175
They're extremely rare.

01:31:11.549 --> 01:31:14.097
Yeah, his eyes are failing.

01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:17.898
He says the books no longer receive
the attention they fully deserve.

01:31:19.516 --> 01:31:22.144
Any does he possess any documentation

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:24.571
pertaining to his ancestor's
acquisition of the books?

01:31:27.023 --> 01:31:31.489
Um, I mean, they've been
in his family for generations,

01:31:31.569 --> 01:31:34.914
so, there's really
no documentation to speak of.

01:31:37.867 --> 01:31:39.080
Well, they're exquisite,

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.460
and, uh, undoubtedly genuine.

01:31:43.957 --> 01:31:46.961
So... let me talk this over with Mr. Leckey,

01:31:47.043 --> 01:31:48.295
and then we'll be in touch

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:50.756
regarding an estimate
and steps toward a private sale.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.762
Not today?

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:55.055
Not today?

01:31:55.135 --> 01:31:57.763
I'm afraid Mr. Leckey
is out of the office all day.

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:00.724
Well, you see, um...

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:03.644
- I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.
- Melanie Halloran.

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:08.610
Ms. Halloran, we were really
hoping to supply Mr. Beckman

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:13.071
with a, um... estimate today.

01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:17.248
That's why we came up here.

01:32:17.574 --> 01:32:20.497
I wouldn't be able to give you that
without Mr. Leckey's sign off.

01:32:20.577 --> 01:32:23.041
There no one else who could maybe
take a look today?

01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:25.585
As I say, this is really Thomas' department.

01:32:25.665 --> 01:32:27.508
And he'll be back here tomorrow.

01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:30.512
Is there a number we can reach you on
while you're in town?

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:33.886
Ah, fuck.

01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:35.224
So?

01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:37.472
- It went well.
- And?

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:38.679
The main guy wasn't there,

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:42.187
so we had to talk
to the, uh, junior executive...

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.564
- Uh, deputy.
- Deputy, and, uh...

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:49.106
She said what we got is very valuable

01:32:49.731 --> 01:32:53.702
and, uh, we just gotta wait
for the main guy to get back.

01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:57.205
So, we gotta wait for the call,
and then we can get in touch with the...

01:32:57.655 --> 01:32:59.452
- For the meeting.
- When you say wait for their call,

01:32:59.532 --> 01:33:01.250
you mean at the hotel, right?

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:09.209
They're gonna call my cell.

01:33:13.338 --> 01:33:14.385
Turn the engine off.

01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:17.304
Ring your cell phone number.

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:18.885
Ring it now.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:23.560
Fucking ring it, Spencer!
Okay, you know what,

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.517
I'll ring it for you, dipshit.

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:32.399
Let's see.

01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:36.948
<i>What's up? This is Spence.
You know what to do.</i>

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:38.950
Does that sound like
a fucking art dealer to you, huh?

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:40.618
Look, Chas, we can change the message.

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:43.497
Hey, hey, hey, shut up, Eric, all right?
Shut the fuck up!

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:47.206
You need to go back in there.

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:50.042
You get whatever piece of paper
that has your phone number on it back.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:51.796
- How?
- Right fucking now,

01:33:51.876 --> 01:33:54.674
I shit you not, that number's gonna
put us all in jail, you fucking asshole.

01:33:54.754 --> 01:33:55.881
You just need to calm down.

01:33:55.964 --> 01:33:58.178
Hey, don't fucking tell me
to calm down, Warren.

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:01.387
You guys are sending us to jail,
you fucking idiots!

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:04.142
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:06.225
Do you not understand
or are you too fucking stupid?

01:34:06.766 --> 01:34:08.855
If you're so smart, Chas,
why don't you go in there?

01:34:08.935 --> 01:34:10.232
You know what,

01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:13.523
I'll show you what I can do, bitches.

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:18.156
What you got, Mr. Pink?

01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:19.988
- Whoa!
- Fuck! Okay, okay, what?

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:21.910
- What're you doing?
- What the fuck did you just call me?

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:23.578
- What the fuck, man?
- What'd you call me, you fucking bitch?

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:26.286
- Chas.
- What? Where's the talk now, bitch, huh?

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:32.003
This is my life you are
fucking with, man, okay?

01:34:32.083 --> 01:34:33.926
This isn't some fucking game.

01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:38.677
You gotta go back in there
and get that number back.

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:41.638
You gotta go back in there and get that
fucking number back right now, Spencer.

01:34:41.718 --> 01:34:42.639
Go!

01:34:42.719 --> 01:34:44.437
Chas, man, you know
we can't go back in there.

01:34:45.221 --> 01:34:46.434
- We can't.
- I don't give a fuck

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:47.766
what you think you know.

01:34:51.394 --> 01:34:52.896
You've killed us.

01:34:56.316 --> 01:34:57.989
You shot us all in the fucking head.

01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:55.167
See you guys around, I guess.

01:36:02.507 --> 01:36:03.554
See you, man.

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:05.684
I'll call you later.

01:36:06.511 --> 01:36:07.478
Yeah.

01:36:15.186 --> 01:36:16.399
<i>To have this...</i>

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:19.824
<i>this need to know what is on
the other side of that line...</i>

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:25.581
<i>and realizing the only way
to actually do that is to cross it,</i>

01:36:26.572 --> 01:36:28.199
there's never a point in your life after that

01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:30.877
where you haven't already crossed that line.

01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:33.037
Um...

01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:36.298
you know, it's... it was...

01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:38.509
It was definitely a terrifying thing.

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:51.309
<i>I distinctly remember hearing that scream</i>

01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:52.810
<i>in my head over and over again.</i>

01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:54.358
<i>Just the scream of the librarian.</i>

01:36:56.978 --> 01:36:58.070
<i>What have I just done?</i>

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:03.068
<i>I felt so confident this was
gonna be what I needed.</i>

01:37:03.151 --> 01:37:05.740
<i>It was this, "Really? Did I just...
do something horrible?</i>

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:06.821
Did I just...

01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.874
hurt someone forever? Did I just, um,

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:14.045
just take part in something awful?" You know?

01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:21.462
You know, I'm sorry I haven't been
to your games lately. I just...

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:24.593
It's okay.

01:37:25.256 --> 01:37:26.178
How's your form?

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:30.227
Never better.

01:37:33.931 --> 01:37:35.308
How's the new place?

01:37:37.143 --> 01:37:38.486
Well, it's great, you know.

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:44.952
It's actually very convenient.
It's near the shops,

01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:47.954
and close to work and everything.

01:37:48.446 --> 01:37:51.325
<i>We tried to... say things, like,</i>

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.498
<i>"We're not gonna hurt anybody."</i>

01:37:56.579 --> 01:37:59.833
"We're just gonna try to scare,
and get in and get out."

01:38:00.416 --> 01:38:02.510
"We're gonna call the cops afterwards."

01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:05.049
"We're gonna talk to her

01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:06.676
and tell her we're not gonna hurt her."

01:38:20.853 --> 01:38:22.025
But we did.

01:38:31.072 --> 01:38:32.449
And we just tried to...

01:38:34.992 --> 01:38:37.620
get past it, but there's no...

01:38:47.046 --> 01:38:48.673
<i>There's no looking past it.</i>

01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:02.315
<i>It's the middle of the fucking night.</i>

01:39:02.395 --> 01:39:04.693
Warren, it's worse than we thought.

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:07.025
- What are you talking about?
- <i>We, uh,</i>

01:39:07.108 --> 01:39:11.113
we used the same email address
to make the library appointment

01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:13.243
that we used to email Christie's, man.

01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:18.704
<i>They'll find the email,
they're gonna find Halloran,</i>

01:39:19.078 --> 01:39:21.125
find me, us, my phone number.

01:39:21.205 --> 01:39:22.172
Fuck!

01:39:22.915 --> 01:39:25.004
Chas was right, man. Chas was right, Warren.

01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:26.256
Dude, you're overthinking this.

01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:30.132
<i>You just gotta...</i>

01:39:31.382 --> 01:39:32.509
<i>chill out,</i>

01:39:32.592 --> 01:39:34.265
and go back to bed, all right?

01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:39.565
<i>Paranoia will destroy you.</i>

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:52.740
# <i>Happy birthday to you #</i>

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.867
I didn't know.

01:39:54.322 --> 01:39:57.952
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:02.500
<i># Happy birthday, dear Dad #</i>

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:04.082
Finish with a flurry, come on.

01:40:04.165 --> 01:40:07.169
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

01:40:10.546 --> 01:40:12.640
- Okay.
- All right, good job.

01:40:14.467 --> 01:40:16.845
- Good job.
- Happy birthday, Dad.

01:40:16.928 --> 01:40:18.100
Thank you.

01:40:20.264 --> 01:40:21.641
- Cheers.
- Here's to me.

01:41:02.348 --> 01:41:03.440
I love you.

01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:06.402
Oh. All right.

01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:10.531
Okay.

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:12.987
Thanks for coming.

01:41:13.067 --> 01:41:14.364
- All right.
- Love you.

01:42:24.055 --> 01:42:26.183
Excuse me, sir, stop. Stop right there!

01:42:27.099 --> 01:42:28.066
Stop there!

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:34.569
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Fucking asshole!

01:42:34.649 --> 01:42:36.071
Is that all you fucking got?

01:42:36.942 --> 01:42:38.319
Come on!

01:43:38.462 --> 01:43:41.056

<i>After pleading guilty to robbery, conspiracy,</i>

<i>and theft of major artworks,</i>

<i>Spencer Reinhard, Eric Borsuk,</i>

01:45:50.135 --> 01:45:53.730
<i>Charles Allen, and Warren Lipka
now know their fate.</i>

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:59.896
<i>A federal judge sentenced them each
to seven years in a federal prison</i>

01:45:59.979 --> 01:46:01.982
<i>after the four plotted for months to steal</i>

01:46:02.064 --> 01:46:05.029
<i>millions of dollars' worth
of manuscripts and sketches</i>

01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:07.954
<i>from Transylvania University's
special collections.</i>

01:46:13.117 --> 01:46:15.456
<i>You're taught your entire life</i>
<i>that what you do matters</i>

01:46:15.536 --> 01:46:16.754
<i>and that you're special.</i>

01:46:18.664 --> 01:46:22.134
And that, there are things
you can point towards

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:23.711
that would...

01:46:24.461 --> 01:46:25.963
which'll show that you're special,

01:46:26.547 --> 01:46:27.799
that shows that you're different,

01:46:27.882 --> 01:46:31.807
when, in all reality, those things...

01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:34.141
don't matter.

01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:35.518
And you're not special.

01:46:36.849 --> 01:46:38.772
<i>And so, the idea that</i>

01:46:39.935 --> 01:46:42.529
<i>we were doing this extraordinary thing</i>

01:46:43.856 --> 01:46:45.403
absolutely appealed to us.

01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:47.742
Appealed to me.

01:46:52.197 --> 01:46:53.289
<i>Looking back on it,</i>

01:46:54.158 --> 01:46:57.913
I've often wondered which events
I remember from Warren's point of view,

01:46:58.537 --> 01:46:59.875
or I remember from my own.

01:46:59.955 --> 01:47:03.255
And, if it was easier to...

01:47:04.543 --> 01:47:07.843
choose one over the other
because of what it provided for us.

01:47:18.307 --> 01:47:20.435
<i>I don't remember if the guy
I saw in Central Park</i>

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:24.567
was someone that I saw

01:47:24.647 --> 01:47:27.275
or somebody that Warren told me I saw.

01:47:32.863 --> 01:47:35.036
- All right, bro. Go get 'em.
- Yeah.

01:47:36.951 --> 01:47:41.172
<i>All I remember from his Amsterdam trip
was dropping him off at the airport</i>

01:47:41.747 --> 01:47:42.794
<i>and picking him up.</i>

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:57.388
I definitely don't have evidence
or actual proof

01:47:57.471 --> 01:48:00.145
that... that Warren went to Amsterdam.

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:09.150
<i>Over the years, I've definitely come to think</i>

01:48:09.233 --> 01:48:12.112
<i>that Warren's whole story</i>

01:48:12.194 --> 01:48:14.492
about meeting with an Amsterdam buyer,

01:48:15.698 --> 01:48:18.417
that, most likely,
he just made the whole thing up.

01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:29.177
I guess they just have
to take my word for it.

01:48:32.798 --> 01:48:36.052
There was a version of the story
that I wanted to believe,

01:48:36.135 --> 01:48:38.513
and that I chose to believe.

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:41.899
And oftentimes, it was Warren's.

01:48:45.686 --> 01:48:48.734
But the pain that I caused,

01:48:48.814 --> 01:48:52.613
both to my family and to BJ are...

01:48:52.693 --> 01:48:58.075
were never worth the adventure
that we felt at the time, or the...

01:48:59.825 --> 01:49:01.873
the change in our life that we were craving.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.595
<i>I think they wanted things
to come easy for them.</i>

01:49:12.171 --> 01:49:16.017
<i>They did not want to work
for a transformative experience.</i>

01:49:16.633 --> 01:49:21.309
<i>They didn't want to help other people
to achieve a transformative experience.</i>

01:49:21.847 --> 01:49:23.724
<i>I find them all very selfish.</i>

01:49:25.476 --> 01:49:29.857
<i>And I see they all have trouble
figuring out how a person</i>

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:33.279
crosses a line in their own mind,

01:49:33.942 --> 01:49:37.157
to be willing to hurt another person

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:38.659
to get what they want.

01:49:39.907 --> 01:49:42.329
And I think that,
once you've crossed that line,

01:49:42.409 --> 01:49:44.707
I think it's a dangerous line to cross.

01:49:54.046 --> 01:49:56.765
It makes me wonder
if they really know why they did it.

01:52:42.005 --> 01:52:44.303
<i># Was it a huntsman
Or a player #</i>

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:46.928
<i># That made you pay the cost #</i>

01:52:47.386 --> 01:52:49.889
<i># That now assumes
Relaxed positions #</i>

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:52.308
<i># And prostitutes your loss #</i>

01:52:52.891 --> 01:52:55.564
<i># Were you tortured
By your own thirst #</i>

01:52:55.644 --> 01:52:57.738
<i># In those pleasures
That you seek #</i>

01:52:58.313 --> 01:53:00.691
<i># That made you
Tom the curious #</i>

01:53:01.024 --> 01:53:02.867
<i># That makes you
James the weak? #</i>

01:53:13.412 --> 01:53:17.087
<i># And you claim
You got something going #</i>

01:53:20.377 --> 01:53:22.425
<i># Something you call unique #</i>

01:53:25.882 --> 01:53:28.351
<i># But I've seen
Your self-pity showing #</i>

01:53:31.305 --> 01:53:33.899
<i># As the tears rolled down your cheeks #</i>

01:53:44.276 --> 01:53:46.370
<i># Soon you know I'll leave you #</i>

01:53:46.695 --> 01:53:48.914
<i># And I'll never look behind #</i>

01:53:49.323 --> 01:53:51.792
<i># 'Cause I was born for the purpose #</i>

01:53:52.117 --> 01:53:54.290
<i># That crucifies your mind #</i>

01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:56.956
<i># So, con, convince your mirror #</i>

01:53:57.456 --> 01:53:59.675
<i># As you've always done before #</i>

01:54:00.250 --> 01:54:02.469
<i># Giving substance to shadows #</i>

01:54:02.919 --> 01:54:04.922
<i># Giving substance ever more #</i>

01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:19.486
<i># And you assume
You got something to offer #</i>

01:54:22.439 --> 01:54:24.737
<i># Secrets shiny and new #</i>

01:54:27.903 --> 01:54:30.076
<i># But how much of you is repetition #</i>

01:54:33.325 --> 01:54:35.623
<i># That you didn't whisper to him, too #</i>
