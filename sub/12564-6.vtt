<i>Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>
I'm pregnant.</i>

00:04.313 --> 00:06.647
- This is your first day.
- I have the job?

00:06.649 --> 00:08.265
Unpaid internship.

00:08.267 --> 00:10.317
Remember I told you that
councilman retired last night?

00:10.319 --> 00:11.402
Don't do it, Evan.

00:11.404 --> 00:12.903
I'm gonna run for village council.

00:12.905 --> 00:14.355
We want to buy Hankmed.

00:14.357 --> 00:16.824
I know you're talking to Dr. Van Dyke.

00:16.826 --> 00:18.993
But does that mean you're done
talking to Hankmed?

00:18.995 --> 00:20.911
Well, it depends
on what Hankmed is saying.

00:20.913 --> 00:23.747
It's still a maybe,
but an interested maybe.

00:23.749 --> 00:25.916
- Call me Milos.
- Will do.

00:25.918 --> 00:28.702
He continues to push
for access to Shadow Pond.

00:28.704 --> 00:30.254
Whatever he wants seems to be there.

00:30.256 --> 00:32.840
You've been spending
a lot of time here, haven't you?

00:34.793 --> 00:35.909
Dima!

00:37.679 --> 00:39.797
You still don't know
what Milos wants, right?

00:39.799 --> 00:41.932
But maybe I can offer him
something he needs.

00:41.934 --> 00:44.768
There may be a clinical trial
available for your condition.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.474 --> 01:25.976
- I thought you'd be taller.
- So did I.

01:32.434 --> 01:36.770
Tell me, the fda was amenable
to our plan?

01:36.772 --> 01:38.022
Sort of.

01:38.024 --> 01:40.240
We'll be posted online
as a clinical trial,

01:40.242 --> 01:41.825
but only for two weeks

01:41.827 --> 01:45.646
and visible only to computers
with Hungarian I.P. addresses.

01:45.648 --> 01:48.916
So we can go fishing,
just in a very small pond.

01:48.918 --> 01:50.751
Well, it's more than I expected.

01:50.753 --> 01:52.319
For a guy who's supposed to be dead,

01:52.321 --> 01:53.871
you still wield an impressive amount

01:53.873 --> 01:55.255
of government influence.

01:55.257 --> 01:58.342
Well, we're fortunate
that my wife is both an expert

01:58.344 --> 02:00.094
on my family disease

02:00.096 --> 02:01.629
and a cooperative Cuban dissident.

02:01.631 --> 02:04.181
Marisa's been great.

02:04.183 --> 02:06.600
Once we finalize the protocols,
this will walk, talk,

02:06.602 --> 02:09.219
and smell like a real clinical trial.

02:09.221 --> 02:11.055
Good.

02:11.056 --> 02:13.357
So the trap is nearly set.

02:13.359 --> 02:15.893
The sealed indictment is in place,

02:15.895 --> 02:20.180
and in a matter of weeks,
Milos will get off a plane...

02:20.182 --> 02:21.699
And be arrested.

02:21.701 --> 02:24.318
Boris, this is good news.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.204
But incomplete, Hank.

02:27.206 --> 02:29.490
I want to know what it is he had Dmitry

02:29.492 --> 02:30.991
trying to find at Shadow Pond.

02:30.993 --> 02:35.879
And I want to know what it is
worth killing Dima for.

02:35.881 --> 02:38.832
Once he's arrested, Milos may...

02:38.834 --> 02:40.801
not be so willing to reveal that.

02:40.803 --> 02:42.720
The world thinks you're dead, Boris.

02:42.722 --> 02:46.140
If the price of being able
to put Milos behind bars

02:46.142 --> 02:48.509
and properly bury your brother
is living a little longer

02:48.511 --> 02:51.044
with that mystery, isn't it worth it...

02:51.046 --> 02:52.896
to actually be living again?

03:06.778 --> 03:07.945
Good morning, Divya.

03:07.947 --> 03:10.364
Hey, Sandra. Hi, Max.

03:10.366 --> 03:12.950
Oh, another nosebleed?

03:12.952 --> 03:14.418
Just like Rudolph!

03:14.420 --> 03:17.171
Oh, his is red on the outside, honey.

03:17.173 --> 03:19.256
Did it start spontaneously, like before?

03:19.258 --> 03:21.008
Along with some picking probably,

03:21.010 --> 03:22.676
or maybe it's related to his allergies.

03:22.678 --> 03:24.595
Or the wind's affecting his asthma.

03:24.597 --> 03:26.680
I can give him
a quick checkup if you'd like.

03:26.682 --> 03:29.683
Max is one of those kids
who just catches everything.

03:29.685 --> 03:31.602
Plus, he's late for camp.
I'm late for work.

03:31.604 --> 03:33.937
I don't even have time to do my makeup.

03:33.939 --> 03:37.391
Ah, the glamorous life
of a single mother.

03:37.393 --> 03:39.593
How about this?

03:39.595 --> 03:42.196
I'll put Max in the car,
check up on his nosebleed

03:42.198 --> 03:43.313
while you do your makeup?

03:43.315 --> 03:45.816
That's a deal. Thanks.

03:45.818 --> 03:47.267
Come on.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.702
Okay, Max, here we go.

03:48.704 --> 03:52.239
So tell me, to stop a nosebleed,

03:52.241 --> 03:54.625
do you tilt your head forward or back?

03:54.627 --> 03:57.327
- Forward.
- Gold star!

04:00.249 --> 04:03.450
Okay, let's have a look inside.

04:08.389 --> 04:09.640
A little inflammation,

04:09.642 --> 04:11.225
but otherwise nothing unusual.

04:11.227 --> 04:13.093
Let me know if he develops
any other symptoms

04:13.095 --> 04:15.229
or if you'd like me
to give him a closer look.

04:15.231 --> 04:17.130
Of course. Thanks for your help.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.982
Max, say thank you to Divya.

04:18.983 --> 04:21.134
Thank you to Divya.

04:21.136 --> 04:24.188
You are welcome.

04:24.190 --> 04:26.139
Oh! Bless you.

04:36.202 --> 04:38.786
It was nice to meet you,
and you as well.

04:38.788 --> 04:39.920
And you, sir.

04:39.922 --> 04:42.172
Your eyes are striking.
May I just say that?

04:42.174 --> 04:44.675
Um, you know what? Uh, nice to meet you.

04:44.677 --> 04:46.126
I want to thank all of you for coming.

04:46.128 --> 04:47.878
Sir, thank you so much for coming.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.214
Thank you so much
for coming, sir, really.

04:50.216 --> 04:51.665
Um, look at this hair, huh?

04:51.667 --> 04:52.933
It's like a bird's gonna
fly out of there.

04:52.935 --> 04:55.686
Okay, can I have a picture
with your baby?

04:55.688 --> 04:57.638
Do you mind?
You guys want to get in too?

04:57.640 --> 05:00.440
Okay, Paige. Say cheese.

05:00.442 --> 05:02.609
Dr. Sacani's been with Hankmed
for almost a year,

05:02.611 --> 05:04.111
but recently spent the winter
in Greenland?

05:04.113 --> 05:05.479
- Iceland.
- Oh, that's right.

05:05.481 --> 05:07.281
The icy one's green,
and the green one's icy,

05:07.283 --> 05:09.366
and no one can tell you why.

05:09.368 --> 05:11.118
Iceland is a semantic translation

05:11.120 --> 05:12.536
of their words for "is" and "land."

05:12.538 --> 05:14.521
Greenland was named by Erik The Red

05:14.523 --> 05:15.956
to attract settlers.

05:15.958 --> 05:17.241
Oh, well, look at that.

05:17.243 --> 05:20.160
Now tell us what "Ikea" means.

05:20.162 --> 05:21.712
- Hello, Shelby.
- Oh.

05:21.714 --> 05:22.996
Hello.

05:22.998 --> 05:24.698
Jeremiah, do you mind seeing
if Hank is here for me?

05:24.700 --> 05:26.083
Not at all.

05:26.085 --> 05:27.868
Divya Katdare
is the other member of Hankmed

05:27.870 --> 05:28.919
who toured Savannah.

05:28.921 --> 05:30.137
Oh, you're also with Symphony.

05:30.139 --> 05:32.055
Yes, and I understand
we might soon be saying

05:32.057 --> 05:33.140
the same for you.

05:33.142 --> 05:34.925
- Eugene Sims.
- Nice to meet you.

05:34.927 --> 05:36.260
I'd love to stay and chat,

05:36.262 --> 05:38.562
but I've got to jump
on this call with Dr. Van Dyke.

05:38.564 --> 05:41.732
Pleasure meeting you,
Ms. Katdare. Shelby.

05:43.569 --> 05:45.569
Dr. Sims is the big boss.

05:45.571 --> 05:48.054
- Hmm, checking up on you.
- No, checking up on you.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.274
He's pushing me for a decision
on who's gonna run

05:50.276 --> 05:51.992
the concierge program by Monday.

05:51.994 --> 05:54.161
He's a big Dr. Van Dyke fan.

05:54.163 --> 05:56.580
Then he and Dr. Van Dyke
have that in common.

05:56.582 --> 05:59.032
- Paul's a good doctor.
- Okay.

05:59.034 --> 06:02.202
But would he have diagnosed
my M.S. off of a broken finger?

06:02.204 --> 06:04.504
I came here for Hankmed, so help me out.

06:04.506 --> 06:06.907
What's Hank's achilles' heel?

06:06.909 --> 06:08.625
What floats his boat?
Where's his "yes" button?

06:08.627 --> 06:10.761
I'm sorry, but you're gonna
have to ask Hank.

06:10.763 --> 06:13.096
Excuse me.

06:13.098 --> 06:16.767
Excuse me, may I have your attention?

06:16.769 --> 06:19.386
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure

06:19.388 --> 06:22.105
to introduce to you my husband

06:22.107 --> 06:24.224
and your next village councilman,

06:24.226 --> 06:26.860
Evan R. Lawson.

06:28.781 --> 06:32.316
Thank you very much. Thank you, Paige.

06:32.318 --> 06:35.819
So let me just start by saying

06:35.821 --> 06:37.988
I am so pleased to be here today.

06:37.990 --> 06:42.292
To trample the habitat
of the piping plover?

06:42.294 --> 06:44.110
Not sure what that means,

06:44.112 --> 06:46.296
but, uh, sir, sorry, would you mind...

06:46.298 --> 06:47.998
unrestricted development is destroying

06:48.000 --> 06:49.800
the biodiversity of long island.

06:49.802 --> 06:51.752
If people like you are elected,

06:51.754 --> 06:53.220
our children could grow up never seeing

06:53.222 --> 06:55.806
an eastern tiger salamander
or a banded sunfish

06:55.808 --> 06:57.391
or a swamp darter.

06:57.393 --> 07:00.627
So, yes, yes, I would mind.
I see it's going well.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.562
So maybe... we can talk about
this afterwards if you'd like.

07:02.564 --> 07:03.981
Let me ask you something.

07:03.983 --> 07:05.816
Have you ever held
an eastern tiger salamander?

07:05.818 --> 07:07.801
Because I suggest that you do

07:07.803 --> 07:10.487
and that you look it
in its tiny, little eyes,

07:10.489 --> 07:14.074
and you tell it face-to-face,
man-to-salamander,

07:14.076 --> 07:16.743
how it can kiss
its breeding ponds good-bye

07:16.745 --> 07:18.362
'cause you need your double venti

07:18.364 --> 07:20.831
- corporation-blend coffee drink.
- Stop!

07:20.833 --> 07:22.749
- And how the best place...
- Watch... wa... sir, wa...

07:22.751 --> 07:24.584
- for your new parking lot...
- Look at... wait, wait... look out.

07:24.586 --> 07:27.204
Where you want to stick
your big, fat SUV

07:27.206 --> 07:28.672
- right on top of...
- Everybody look out!

07:30.709 --> 07:33.377
Everybody stay calm. Oh, my God.

Oh, my God! Aah. Help! Somebody help!

07:42.540 --> 07:44.189
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Get it out of me!

07:44.191 --> 07:46.158
- You want me to...
- Get it out of me now!

07:46.160 --> 07:48.577
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry!
- Oh! Oh!

07:48.579 --> 07:51.163
- No, never do that!
- Oh!

07:51.165 --> 07:52.581
I didn't do it! It was the wind!

07:52.583 --> 07:54.199
Don't take the object out.

07:54.201 --> 07:56.218
Depending on what it's hit,
you could do more damage.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.253
- Oh, God.
- You're trying to kill me!

07:58.255 --> 08:00.756
No, I'm not. You were
screaming, "get it out."

08:00.758 --> 08:02.707
Sir, I'm a doctor. Hank Lawson.

08:02.709 --> 08:04.393
- What's your name?
- Pat.

08:04.395 --> 08:06.762
Wait, Lawson? Are you related to him?

08:06.764 --> 08:08.347
Yes. We're brothers.

08:08.349 --> 08:10.432
- Oh, God, I'm gonna die!
- What do you need?

08:10.434 --> 08:12.518
Betadine, clinda solution, lidocaine,

08:12.520 --> 08:14.603
a suture set, and an irrigation tray,

08:14.605 --> 08:16.605
maybe a rubber glove.

08:16.607 --> 08:18.357
Pat, I need to probe the wound, okay?

08:18.359 --> 08:19.691
This is gonna be a little uncomfortable.

08:19.693 --> 08:21.743
Whoa, more uncomfortable
than getting stabbed

08:21.745 --> 08:23.946
by a flying umbrel... oh, God!

08:23.948 --> 08:25.080
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Stop!

08:25.082 --> 08:27.166
But I need to be sure
no organs were damaged.

08:27.168 --> 08:28.567
- No, stop it!
- Okay.

08:28.569 --> 08:30.502
- Ugh! Aah!
- Okay.

08:30.504 --> 08:32.287
Yeah. And it looks like nothing
went past the fascia,

08:32.289 --> 08:33.505
so you're lucky.

08:33.506 --> 08:36.174
Oh, super lucky, that's me.

08:36.177 --> 08:37.741
Jeremiah, would you
anesthetize and irrigate?

08:37.744 --> 08:39.428
- Can you stitch it up here?
- Yeah, definitely.

08:39.429 --> 08:41.413
But to help with any
lymphatic fluid buildup,

08:41.414 --> 08:43.347
I want to make a penrose drain
out of a rubber glove.

08:43.350 --> 08:47.052
- Of course you do.
- Grab me a glove.

08:47.054 --> 08:49.137
Thank you. Good.

08:49.139 --> 08:51.773
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:51.775 --> 08:54.776
Okay. Good.

08:54.778 --> 08:56.528
All right.

08:56.530 --> 08:59.031
- What are you doing?
- I'm inserting the drain.

08:59.033 --> 09:00.432
Oh!

09:00.434 --> 09:01.650
All right, you're gonna feel
some pinching.

09:01.652 --> 09:02.784
Oh, yep! Pinching!

09:02.786 --> 09:04.269
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

09:04.271 --> 09:06.788
- It's going through.
- It's going <i>through?</i>

09:06.790 --> 09:08.790
Yes, it's going through.

09:08.792 --> 09:11.776
Okay.

09:11.778 --> 09:14.213
And...

09:14.215 --> 09:15.297
There we go.

09:15.299 --> 09:16.948
And...

09:16.950 --> 09:18.417
There.

09:18.419 --> 09:21.553
Why would you even bring
that homicidal umbrella

09:21.555 --> 09:22.787
on a day like this?

09:22.789 --> 09:24.172
The weatherman said it would be hot.

09:24.174 --> 09:26.475
He doesn't control the weather!

09:26.477 --> 09:28.927
Think for yourself, puppet man.

09:28.929 --> 09:30.646
Oh, man.

09:30.648 --> 09:33.315
Look, Evan, he's gonna be okay.

09:33.317 --> 09:34.850
Yeah, I'm not.

09:34.852 --> 09:36.735
This is a full-blown
P.R. crisis now, Paige.

09:36.737 --> 09:38.854
How am I supposed to recover
from this? I can't.

09:38.856 --> 09:41.156
Wait a second. Maybe your dad can help.

09:41.158 --> 09:43.108
Would he talk to me?
Yeah, I'm sure he would.

09:43.110 --> 09:44.493
But maybe you don't need that.

09:44.495 --> 09:46.361
Maybe this whole thing will just...

09:46.363 --> 09:48.146
Blow over? Really?

09:48.148 --> 09:50.249
Okay, I'll ask.

09:50.251 --> 09:51.700
Thank you.

09:51.702 --> 09:54.286
Would you describe your pain
as dull or sharp?

09:54.288 --> 09:56.955
Sharp. It comes and goes.

09:56.957 --> 10:00.325
Okay, so abdominal pain,
gastrointestinal distress.

10:00.327 --> 10:02.261
Could it be
Montezuma's revenge's revenge?

10:02.263 --> 10:05.097
- Uh...
- I was in Mexico last week,

10:05.099 --> 10:07.182
and I used the tap water
to brush my teeth,

10:07.184 --> 10:09.184
and I threw up all night.

10:09.186 --> 10:12.554
Now I don't feel well,
so revenge's revenge.

10:12.556 --> 10:15.474
Ah. Well, barring any symptoms
between then and now,

10:15.476 --> 10:16.841
it's unlikely to be related.

10:16.843 --> 10:18.226
Well, I guess not, then.

10:18.228 --> 10:19.561
Were you there on vacation?

10:19.563 --> 10:21.179
No. Business.

10:21.181 --> 10:24.683
Have you ever heard
of SkinnieMinnie cocktails?

10:24.685 --> 10:27.953
Low-Cal mojitos, margaritas.

10:27.955 --> 10:29.788
- You know.
- You're the "Minnie."

10:29.790 --> 10:31.873
And that's the skinny.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.209
So what do I need... antibiotics?

10:34.211 --> 10:36.194
No, I think what you have
is probably just a stomach bug

10:36.196 --> 10:38.029
that's been going around or
maybe a touch of food poisoning,

10:38.031 --> 10:39.698
for which you can blame the Hamptons,

10:39.700 --> 10:41.383
not the habañeros.

10:41.385 --> 10:42.834
Can you tell us about your diet?

10:42.836 --> 10:45.721
It's not a diet. It's a lifestyle.

10:45.723 --> 10:47.639
- Your trainer?
- Slash-nutritionist,

10:47.641 --> 10:49.558
slash-life coach, slash-boyfriend.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.226
- His name's Todd.
- My name's Todd.

10:51.228 --> 10:52.678
Hi, Todd. I'm Dr. Hank Lawson,

10:52.680 --> 10:54.646
and this is Divya Katdare,
my physician assistant.

10:54.648 --> 10:56.398
- Hello.
- Seriously?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.266
Why would you call a doctor
when you have me?

10:58.268 --> 10:59.685
Because you're not a doctor.

10:59.687 --> 11:01.737
- Uh, listen, Todd...
- No, you listen.

11:01.739 --> 11:03.355
Just because you went to medical school

11:03.357 --> 11:04.906
doesn't mean you know
all about the human body.

11:04.908 --> 11:06.558
It means I know something about it.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.527
Everything we consume is medicine.

11:08.529 --> 11:11.496
Food is medicine. Vitamins are medicine.

11:11.498 --> 11:13.615
Medicine is medicine.

11:13.617 --> 11:15.900
Yeah, I get where
you're coming from, I think,

11:15.902 --> 11:18.403
but of those three things,
one requires a prescription,

11:18.405 --> 11:19.738
which requires a doctor.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.174
All we require is unprocessed foods

11:22.176 --> 11:23.625
and functional training.

11:23.627 --> 11:24.926
And supplements.

11:24.928 --> 11:26.428
Supplements?

11:26.430 --> 11:29.014
Vitamin "D," vitamin "E,"
i-theanine, magnesium,

11:29.016 --> 11:31.933
glucosamine, creatine, a daily
super green, and a probiotic.

11:31.935 --> 11:34.686
Have you added any
or changed quantities recently?

11:34.688 --> 11:36.722
No.

11:36.724 --> 11:39.441
Okay, well, until
your stomach settles down,

11:39.443 --> 11:41.560
my advice is to lay off the supplements,

11:41.562 --> 11:44.095
get plenty of fluids, and I'll
prescribe you some loperamide

11:44.097 --> 11:45.147
for the G.I. issues.

11:45.149 --> 11:46.531
You don't need that.

11:46.533 --> 11:47.932
What you need is more intestinal flora.

11:47.934 --> 11:49.534
- Todd...
- I know what I'm doing, Minnie.

11:49.536 --> 11:51.603
Seriously, I got this.

11:51.605 --> 11:53.905
Uh, personally, I love intestinal flora,

11:53.907 --> 11:56.708
especially this time of year,
but just in case.

11:56.710 --> 12:00.128
Thank you.

12:00.130 --> 12:01.830
Okay.

12:01.832 --> 12:03.832
Get it out! Get it out of me!

12:03.834 --> 12:06.001
- You want me to pull it out?
- Get it out now!

12:09.139 --> 12:11.973
No, Evan, never do that!

12:11.975 --> 12:14.476
At least he got it out.

12:14.478 --> 12:15.927
Daddy.

12:15.929 --> 12:18.313
Well, he's not exactly Mr. Universe.

12:18.315 --> 12:19.848
Evan's in a panic over this.

12:19.850 --> 12:21.233
He thinks his campaign is over.

12:21.235 --> 12:24.936
Nothing's over
till the last ballot is counted.

12:24.938 --> 12:26.738
Isn't that what you used to say to me?

12:26.740 --> 12:29.274
Yes. But if you said it to him,

12:29.276 --> 12:31.309
I think it would mean a lot more.

12:31.311 --> 12:33.078
You know how he respects you.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.312
I thought he was afraid of me.

12:34.314 --> 12:37.699
Terrified... but in a respectful way.

12:37.701 --> 12:39.367
I don't know, honey.
Maybe the best thing is just

12:39.369 --> 12:42.254
to wait five minutes
till the next knucklehead

12:42.256 --> 12:45.424
shows up on the Internet.

12:45.426 --> 12:47.008
I don't mean to be critical.

12:47.010 --> 12:50.995
It's just, I've never found him
to be the most serious person.

12:50.997 --> 12:54.883
Okay, but Evan has no idea
how brutal it can be.

12:54.885 --> 12:57.936
You do. So can you just
set him straight?

12:57.938 --> 13:01.139
Sweetie, I'm a four-star general

13:01.141 --> 13:03.341
and a United States senator.

13:03.343 --> 13:06.111
A personal pep rally
for a local council candidate

13:06.113 --> 13:10.115
is sort of below my pay grade.

13:10.117 --> 13:14.119
But I'm also your father, so...

13:14.121 --> 13:16.955
Just don't tell anyone.

13:18.692 --> 13:19.875
Thank you.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.135
Max, you okay, honey?

13:31.505 --> 13:32.921
Let me get you some water, Max.

13:44.016 --> 13:46.485
No, you've done an amazing job.

13:46.487 --> 13:48.770
I mean, the methodology, the research,

13:48.772 --> 13:50.405
the physician BIOS...

13:50.407 --> 13:51.773
it definitely looks and feels like

13:51.775 --> 13:53.408
a real clinical trial,

13:53.410 --> 13:55.744
which is, obviously, the whole...

13:55.746 --> 13:57.078
Idea.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.063
I need to call you back.

13:59.065 --> 14:00.615
Who was that?

14:00.617 --> 14:02.334
That was no one.

14:02.336 --> 14:04.402
Why are you stealing my milk again?

14:04.404 --> 14:05.904
Forget the milk. Why are you setting up

14:05.906 --> 14:07.405
a fake clinical trial?

14:07.407 --> 14:09.073
You're supposed to be
up in the big house, right?

14:09.075 --> 14:11.242
Not eavesdropping on my conversations.

14:11.244 --> 14:12.845
Oh, that's funny,
'cause my eavesdropping

14:12.846 --> 14:14.262
just told me that you might be headed

14:14.264 --> 14:15.514
to the actual big house.

14:15.516 --> 14:18.133
So what's going on?

14:18.135 --> 14:20.418
I can't tell you, okay?

14:20.420 --> 14:24.139
But I swear it will all
make sense eventually.

14:24.141 --> 14:26.424
Okay, I don't care about eventually.

14:26.426 --> 14:28.443
I care about right now,
because right now

14:28.445 --> 14:30.478
the only explanation
I can even come up with

14:30.480 --> 14:32.314
is that you're involved
in some kind of insurance fraud

14:32.316 --> 14:34.399
- or something.
- Well, I'm not, okay?

14:34.401 --> 14:36.618
- Trust me.
- Just trust you? No!

14:36.620 --> 14:38.703
Henry, that's not how this works.

14:38.705 --> 14:40.622
We are brothers, and we're partners.

14:40.624 --> 14:42.607
And what I just heard in there
isn't only about you.

14:42.609 --> 14:44.993
It's about us, our lives, our business,

14:44.995 --> 14:46.294
all of it.

14:46.296 --> 14:50.916
So, for a change,
how about you trust me?

15:01.273 --> 15:05.076
So Dmitry is dead...

15:05.078 --> 15:07.645
and Boris is alive?

15:07.647 --> 15:09.013
Mm-hmm.

15:10.917 --> 15:13.351
- And you've known this since?
- Budapest.

15:13.353 --> 15:14.819
Oh.

15:14.821 --> 15:16.588
I didn't tell you
because Boris wants to keep

15:16.590 --> 15:18.356
the number of people who know
to a minimum,

15:18.358 --> 15:20.759
particularly given
what Milos is capable of.

15:20.761 --> 15:23.928
Okay. Why can't he just
be arrested over there?

15:23.930 --> 15:25.330
He could, with enough evidence,

15:25.332 --> 15:27.999
but all the attempts
on Boris' life were made here.

15:28.001 --> 15:29.134
Oh, that's interesting.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.136
Are Paige and I safe
in the castle or...?

15:31.138 --> 15:33.004
That's the first thing I asked.

15:33.006 --> 15:36.140
Milos will never get
within 50 miles of this place,

15:36.142 --> 15:37.992
as long as we stick to the plan.

15:37.994 --> 15:39.143
What about the thing?

15:39.145 --> 15:40.528
The thing he was having Dmitry
look for...

15:40.530 --> 15:41.830
- do you know what that could be?
- Don't know.

15:41.832 --> 15:43.198
But whatever it is,
we have to let go of it

15:43.200 --> 15:44.999
and focus on getting Milos behind bars,

15:45.001 --> 15:46.501
for Boris' sake.

15:46.503 --> 15:48.986
Okay. All righty.

15:48.988 --> 15:50.321
- Okay.
- I'm in.

15:50.323 --> 15:51.790
You're...

15:51.792 --> 15:54.626
- Tell me what I can do.
- Nothing.

15:54.628 --> 15:56.010
You're not part of the plan.

15:56.012 --> 15:59.180
But... I'm in.

15:59.182 --> 16:01.099
But...

16:01.101 --> 16:03.101
- You're not.
- But...

16:03.103 --> 16:04.969
Evan, the plan is to let
Milos think he's coming here

16:04.971 --> 16:07.722
to be part of a clinical trial,
land at JFK, and get arrested.

16:07.724 --> 16:09.190
That's it.

16:09.192 --> 16:11.643
We deviate from that,
we start taking risks.

16:11.645 --> 16:13.194
But if you really want
to do something...

16:13.196 --> 16:15.179
- I do.
- You can buy me more milk...

16:15.181 --> 16:16.781
Two percent.

16:16.783 --> 16:18.283
That's really very funny.

16:21.187 --> 16:23.037
I'm supposed to be
at Hotel Hampton later today,

16:23.039 --> 16:24.239
schmoozing and boozing.

16:24.241 --> 16:26.241
There are gonna be photographers, Hank...

16:26.243 --> 16:27.742
professional photographers.

16:27.744 --> 16:29.377
Okay, well,
I'll prescribe you some Benadryl

16:29.379 --> 16:31.546
and a topical steroid,
but that's treating symptoms,

16:31.548 --> 16:32.964
and I want to treat the cause.

16:32.966 --> 16:34.999
- With antibiotics?
- With a diagnosis.

16:35.001 --> 16:37.085
So did you stop taking the supplements?

16:37.087 --> 16:38.920
Well, much to Todd's chagrin.

16:38.922 --> 16:40.839
He means well, I swear.

16:40.841 --> 16:43.308
If it wasn't for Todd,
I wouldn't be Skinny Minnie.

16:43.310 --> 16:45.677
I'd be Minnie-Minnie-Double-Chinny.

16:45.679 --> 16:47.178
High-school nickname.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.596
Uh, did you lose the weight recently?

16:48.598 --> 16:50.515
In college, thanks to diet and exercise.

16:50.517 --> 16:51.733
- Good for you.
- I'm kidding.

16:51.735 --> 16:53.685
- I totally had bulimia.
- Oh, okay.

16:53.687 --> 16:55.887
- But now, medically, you're...
- All clear.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.572
I have been for years.

16:57.574 --> 16:59.858
But I was bad... no willpower.

16:59.860 --> 17:04.244
So he's like my savior.
He is my willpower.

17:04.247 --> 17:05.829
So what do you think I have?

17:05.832 --> 17:07.531
Well, it could be
an inflammatory bowel disease.

17:07.534 --> 17:08.750
Ew.

17:08.752 --> 17:10.417
So I'd like to take some blood
and schedule you

17:10.420 --> 17:11.786
for a colonoscopy with a biopsy.

17:11.788 --> 17:14.672
- Yay! Colonoscopy!
- It's very routine.

17:14.674 --> 17:16.457
Now, if you do have
an intestinal condition,

17:16.459 --> 17:18.675
some symptoms can be aggravated
by certain foods.

17:18.678 --> 17:20.762
You know who else is aggravated?

17:20.763 --> 17:22.513
Does he do this a lot?

17:22.516 --> 17:24.965
Me. I'm aggravated.

17:24.968 --> 17:26.684
- Hi, Todd.
- You cheated on me.

17:26.685 --> 17:28.603
Wh... what? I would never...

17:28.605 --> 17:31.022
But worse, you cheated on yourself.

17:31.024 --> 17:34.025
Look what I found on Facebook.

17:34.027 --> 17:35.610
Okay, that is not what it looks like.

17:35.612 --> 17:37.278
It looks like you're drinking
a ton of beer.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.314
Then it is what it looks like.

17:39.316 --> 17:41.366
So, when you got sick in Mexico,

17:41.368 --> 17:43.117
- it wasn't from the water.
- Dude, I got this.

17:43.119 --> 17:44.602
So, when you got sick in Mexico,

17:44.604 --> 17:46.788
- it wasn't from the water.
- No, it wasn't.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.105
Minnie, you should have told me that.

17:48.107 --> 17:49.457
Dude, I said I got this.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.709
Minnie, you should have told me that.

17:51.711 --> 17:53.494
Well, you went for a run,

17:53.496 --> 17:55.663
and I went and did
a little market research.

17:55.665 --> 17:57.882
You don't make beer.
How's that market research?

17:57.884 --> 18:01.252
The bar was attached to a market?

18:01.254 --> 18:02.470
You're angry.

18:02.472 --> 18:05.890
I'm disappointed.

18:38.841 --> 18:42.594
There you are.

18:42.596 --> 18:44.262
Hello, sir.

18:44.264 --> 18:46.547
Um...

18:46.549 --> 18:49.601
- Are you looking for Paige?
- No. For you.

18:49.603 --> 18:53.354
She told me about the incident
at your, uh, campaign event,

18:53.356 --> 18:55.673
thought you might like
a little crash course

18:55.675 --> 18:57.642
in crisis management.

18:57.644 --> 19:00.895
Right. Um, great.

19:00.897 --> 19:04.032
Have a seat, please.

19:06.152 --> 19:08.903
You know, I've...
I've really just been trying

19:08.905 --> 19:11.239
to keep the whole thing in perspective.

19:11.241 --> 19:13.124
You know, I was gonna suggest that.

19:13.126 --> 19:15.910
In a 24-hour news cycle,
you can't get hung up

19:15.912 --> 19:17.078
on the little things.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.880
I completely agree.

19:18.882 --> 19:21.249
A stronger wind
or a sharper umbrella pole...

19:21.251 --> 19:23.167
could've been a lot worse.

19:23.169 --> 19:25.920
Son, you seem a whole lot
less flustered about this

19:25.922 --> 19:27.338
than I was led to believe.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.558
Yeah, I guess just with some distance

19:30.560 --> 19:33.811
and some larger concerns
that have come to my attention,

19:33.813 --> 19:36.230
I find it hard to worry
about containing a viral video,

19:36.232 --> 19:37.565
'cause you can't anyway, right?

19:37.567 --> 19:38.883
All you can do is sit back

19:38.885 --> 19:40.268
and wait for the next one to come along.

19:40.270 --> 19:41.769
And the good news is, one always does.

19:41.771 --> 19:43.821
That's for sure.

19:43.823 --> 19:46.357
Hey, have you seen the one
where the kittens get stuck

19:46.359 --> 19:48.860
in a paper towel doodad?

19:48.862 --> 19:51.446
I've been pretty busy, sir.

19:51.448 --> 19:54.365
Of course. Larger concerns.

19:54.367 --> 19:58.586
Anything you want to talk about there?

19:58.588 --> 20:02.206
I'm not really at liberty to discuss it.

20:02.208 --> 20:05.093
- I hope you understand.
- Oh, please.

20:05.095 --> 20:08.296
Some things you take to your grave.

20:08.298 --> 20:12.684
Well, I'd say this was
a wasted visit for you,

20:12.686 --> 20:15.252
but maybe it wasn't for me.

20:15.254 --> 20:19.774
I'm glad to see this new,
more serious side of you, son.

20:19.776 --> 20:22.760
- Very pleased.
- Thank you, sir.

20:51.957 --> 20:55.059
Did you buy that bumper sticker?

20:55.061 --> 20:56.344
What are you doing here?

20:56.346 --> 20:57.762
Following up. I'm a doctor.

20:57.764 --> 21:00.932
It's what I do. So did you buy it?

21:00.934 --> 21:02.734
Uh, no, I made it.

21:02.736 --> 21:04.986
But that's a great idea.
I should sell them.

21:04.988 --> 21:06.771
For the record, that's not
what I was getting at.

21:06.773 --> 21:08.356
You're right, they should be free.

21:08.358 --> 21:09.690
That's even better.

21:09.692 --> 21:11.159
Oh, boy.

21:11.161 --> 21:12.660
Would you mind lying down
on that chaise lounge

21:12.662 --> 21:14.311
so I can get a look at your stitches?

21:14.313 --> 21:16.330
Uh, yeah. Fine.

21:29.711 --> 21:32.930
Uh, good. Good. No signs of infection.

21:32.932 --> 21:34.132
Any discomfort?

21:34.134 --> 21:36.217
Just the usual achiness.

21:36.219 --> 21:37.301
What do you mean "usual"?

21:37.303 --> 21:38.853
My back has been acting up

21:38.855 --> 21:40.388
for the past couple weeks,

21:40.390 --> 21:41.973
so as much as I'd like to,

21:41.975 --> 21:44.108
I can't blame your corporate
shill of a brother for that.

21:44.110 --> 21:46.060
Uh, okay. But let's make sure

21:46.062 --> 21:48.813
there's no internal involvement
from your injury, okay?

21:48.815 --> 21:50.114
Okay, just make it quick, okay?

21:50.116 --> 21:53.151
I need to start printing those stickers.

21:56.405 --> 21:58.706
No, you need to go to a hospital.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.992
I think your back pain is the result

22:00.994 --> 22:02.526
of an aortic dissection.

22:02.528 --> 22:04.745
- Because of the umbrella?
- No, this is unrelated.

22:04.747 --> 22:07.415
But I feel a pulsatile abdominal mass,

22:07.417 --> 22:09.750
and that could mean a tear
in the inner wall of your aorta.

22:09.752 --> 22:12.303
Come on, you're just trying
to protect your brother. This...

22:12.305 --> 22:13.971
No, Pat, this isn't a campaign issue.

22:13.973 --> 22:15.556
It's your life.

22:15.558 --> 22:18.342
All right.

22:18.344 --> 22:19.477
Ah, easy.

22:19.479 --> 22:21.979
But why would my back hurt

22:21.981 --> 22:23.648
because of a problem with my heart?

22:23.650 --> 22:25.549
Because your aorta is
putting pressure on the nerves

22:25.551 --> 22:26.601
running through your back.

22:26.603 --> 22:27.985
Look, I know it's strange,

22:27.987 --> 22:30.021
but that's what makes these
so hard to diagnose.

22:30.023 --> 22:31.405
So how do they usually find them?

22:31.407 --> 22:34.725
During the autopsy.

22:34.727 --> 22:37.578
This has been a lousy couple days.

22:38.698 --> 22:40.665
Bring your head down a little bit

22:40.667 --> 22:42.667
and look towards me a little more.

22:42.669 --> 22:44.869
This is so nice of you. Thank you.

22:44.871 --> 22:47.872
I thought between the cough
and the nosebleeds,

22:47.874 --> 22:49.457
could use a second opinion.

22:49.459 --> 22:52.793
Have you had any recent fatigue?

22:52.795 --> 22:54.629
Uh, uh, weariness.

22:54.631 --> 22:56.764
Lethargy.

22:56.766 --> 22:58.099
Have you been feeling tired?

22:58.101 --> 22:59.467
Uh-uh.

22:59.469 --> 23:02.220
He never gets tired.
I wish I could say the same.

23:02.222 --> 23:05.273
Deep breath.

23:05.275 --> 23:06.807
Good. Again.

23:14.199 --> 23:15.650
He has blood in his sputum.

23:15.652 --> 23:17.151
Blood? Oh, my God.

23:17.153 --> 23:19.070
Why would that be there?

23:19.072 --> 23:21.272
- Can I play now?
- Uh, not just yet.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.991
Hold still, please.

23:27.162 --> 23:30.665
Okay.

23:30.667 --> 23:33.467
Don't worry. We'll schedule
some tests and figure it out.

23:33.469 --> 23:35.836
Well, what kinds of tests?

23:35.838 --> 23:38.005
Pulmonary function, T.B., chest X-ray.

23:38.007 --> 23:40.958
- Did you build this?
- Uh-huh.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.760
- Is it your own design?
- No.

23:42.762 --> 23:44.228
It's on the box.

23:44.230 --> 23:46.013
Oh.

23:46.015 --> 23:48.933
It's still nice.

24:07.536 --> 24:09.921
Um, excuse me.

24:12.090 --> 24:13.841
Uh, may I look under this carpet?

24:13.843 --> 24:15.209
Sure.

24:15.211 --> 24:17.962
Wait a minute.

24:17.964 --> 24:20.464
What are you doing?

24:20.466 --> 24:22.683
And what is that?

24:22.685 --> 24:23.801
Black mold.

24:23.803 --> 24:26.103
When I got down on the carpet by Max,

24:26.105 --> 24:27.355
it smelled musty.

24:27.357 --> 24:29.273
Is that what's making him sick?

24:29.275 --> 24:30.674
Almost certainly.

24:30.676 --> 24:32.310
Children are especially
sensitive to its effects.

24:32.312 --> 24:33.561
Uh, until it can be dealt with,

24:33.563 --> 24:34.979
you'll have to find
someplace else to stay.

24:34.981 --> 24:37.281
And we should alert the neighbor.

24:37.283 --> 24:38.849
I'm the neighbor.

24:40.235 --> 24:43.154
Then it's not safe for you here either.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.500
Okay, I think I might have found it.

24:53.528 --> 24:56.039
- Found what?
- What Milos is after.

24:56.070 --> 24:57.937
Henry, look...

24:57.939 --> 24:58.988
- At this.
- Aah!

24:58.990 --> 25:00.439
Hey, what are you doing?

25:03.077 --> 25:05.444
Singing-bird pistols...

25:05.446 --> 25:07.747
Built in Geneva
by the three Rochat brothers.

25:07.749 --> 25:09.298
Three brothers, Hank...

25:09.300 --> 25:11.300
symbolizing the triumvirate
Milos longed for

25:11.302 --> 25:14.303
with Boris and Dmitry... but was denied.

25:14.305 --> 25:15.788
Triumvirate?

25:15.790 --> 25:17.089
What are you... Ev, I told you not...

25:17.091 --> 25:18.474
And the song the bird sings

25:18.476 --> 25:19.959
is from a melody by Bela Bartok,

25:19.961 --> 25:21.510
- who is from?
- North Dakota.

25:21.512 --> 25:23.679
Hungary, just like Milos.

25:23.681 --> 25:25.815
Ev, what did I say
about deviating from the plan?

25:25.817 --> 25:29.435
- Not to do it!
- Not to do it! Exactly.

25:29.437 --> 25:32.104
Now, go put your little
singing-bird pistols back.

25:32.106 --> 25:36.242
All right.

25:36.244 --> 25:39.195
Don't you think Boris deserves
to know the truth, though?

25:39.197 --> 25:40.863
The guy's brother died for it.

25:40.865 --> 25:43.699
I think straying from the path
is asking for trouble.

25:43.701 --> 25:46.285
Boris already lost his brother.
I don't want to lose mine.

25:54.044 --> 25:55.428
The way you described him,

25:55.430 --> 25:57.880
I expected he'd be like chicken little.

25:57.882 --> 26:01.000
You think that about anyone
who hasn't taken live fire.

26:01.002 --> 26:03.436
True, but you'll be glad to know

26:03.438 --> 26:06.005
he was calm and rational
about the whole thing.

26:06.007 --> 26:08.140
Yeah.

26:08.142 --> 26:10.643
Okay, well, thanks anyway.

26:10.645 --> 26:13.396
What's wrong?
You said to set him straight.

26:13.398 --> 26:15.031
Turns out he already is.

26:15.033 --> 26:17.984
I know. I just thought
it'd go differently.

26:17.986 --> 26:20.236
So did I.

26:20.238 --> 26:23.355
I even think that boy
might have a future in politics.

26:23.357 --> 26:26.492
Great. Maybe you can be
his campaign wife.

26:26.494 --> 26:28.995
What? Now, hang on.

26:28.997 --> 26:30.546
Did you want me to set him straight

26:30.548 --> 26:33.666
or scare him straight so he'd quit?

26:33.668 --> 26:35.217
The second one.

26:35.219 --> 26:38.421
And in my defense,
I feel terrible about it.

26:38.423 --> 26:41.373
It's just, having stepped in for mom

26:41.375 --> 26:43.876
over and over again during your career

26:43.878 --> 26:46.012
and then your campaign, I just...

26:46.014 --> 26:47.680
I know it's selfish.

26:47.682 --> 26:49.214
I just don't want to do it again.

26:49.216 --> 26:51.851
Say no more.

26:51.853 --> 26:54.403
You want me to scare him
out of politics?

26:54.405 --> 26:57.073
Hell, I'll tell him stories

26:57.075 --> 26:59.191
that'll make him afraid to vote again!

27:01.362 --> 27:03.362
You're sweet, daddy,

27:03.364 --> 27:05.748
but this isn't your job,

27:05.750 --> 27:06.749
it's mine.

27:12.039 --> 27:14.256
Thank you, doctor. I'll let him know.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.709
So, Ev, good news
about the guy who hates you.

27:16.711 --> 27:18.594
Pat the protester is gonna live.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.713
A lot of mixed feelings about that.

27:20.715 --> 27:22.465
- Mm.
- Great.

27:22.467 --> 27:25.851
My landlord can't say
when the mold will be gone.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.419
I am officially homeless.

27:27.421 --> 27:30.139
So stay here. Evan's room is empty.

27:30.141 --> 27:32.058
Yeah, Evan's room is empty
because he lives in a castle

27:32.060 --> 27:33.392
with 16 bathrooms,

27:33.394 --> 27:34.777
3 of which could be yours if you want.

27:34.779 --> 27:36.562
Couldn't you move back in
to your parents' house?

27:36.564 --> 27:38.230
Uh, it's rented for the summer,

27:38.232 --> 27:41.117
though even if it weren't,
I can't see that going too well.

27:41.119 --> 27:42.985
Thank you for the offers, though.

27:42.987 --> 27:46.155
- I didn't offer.
- I meant Hank and Evan.

27:46.157 --> 27:49.942
Oh. But you could stay at my house.

27:49.944 --> 27:53.278
Jeremiah, you're not obligated
to offer just because they did.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.664
And in the meantime,
I'm at the Hampt-Inn.

27:55.666 --> 27:57.282
Oh, my God, the Hampt-Inn.

27:57.284 --> 27:59.335
I think that place invented mold.

27:59.337 --> 28:00.803
Can we please just get back to work?

28:00.805 --> 28:03.139
Yeah, okay, so Crohn's usually presents

28:03.141 --> 28:04.673
with erythema nodosum.

28:04.675 --> 28:07.093
But Minnie's reaction
looks like urticaria.

28:07.095 --> 28:09.228
The early inflammatory stages
of erythema nodosum

28:09.230 --> 28:10.763
often resemble urticaria.

28:10.765 --> 28:11.931
I think you're overlooking
the carpe diem,

28:11.933 --> 28:12.982
e pluribus unum ad nauseum.

28:12.984 --> 28:14.133
Not helping.

28:14.135 --> 28:16.102
Besides, you know urticaria.
It means hives.

28:16.104 --> 28:17.319
Oh, yeah, like I get when I'm stressed.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.238
Could this be a stress reaction?

28:19.240 --> 28:21.023
Well, she's definitely been
under a lot of pressure.

28:21.025 --> 28:22.491
Well, that's what happens
when you call your drink

28:22.493 --> 28:23.776
"SkinnieMinnie" and put your silhouette

28:23.778 --> 28:25.161
on every single bottle.

28:25.163 --> 28:26.645
God, you should have seen Todd's face

28:26.647 --> 28:28.147
when he found out
she drank beer in Mexico.

28:28.149 --> 28:29.982
Maybe she's on the Mexican
tapeworm diet.

28:32.702 --> 28:35.171
- The what?
- The Mexican tapeworm diet.

28:35.173 --> 28:36.672
Never heard of this?

28:36.674 --> 28:38.674
You swallow a pill
with a baby tapeworm in it.

28:38.676 --> 28:40.009
It eats whatever you eat,

28:40.011 --> 28:41.160
and then once you reach
your target weight,

28:41.162 --> 28:42.828
you take antibiotics and it dies.

28:42.830 --> 28:44.713
Well, that's awful.

28:44.715 --> 28:47.499
You could do irreparable damage
to your digestive system.

28:47.501 --> 28:49.435
Yeah, also, you could die.

28:49.437 --> 28:50.836
And the antibiotics
wouldn't kill the tapeworm.

28:50.838 --> 28:52.004
You'd need anthelmintics.

28:52.006 --> 28:53.639
Hey, all I know is a guy in college said

28:53.641 --> 28:55.357
his sister went down
to Mazatlan for spring break,

28:55.359 --> 28:57.476
and that's how she lost the freshman 15.

28:57.478 --> 28:59.145
Okay, that has got to be
an urban legend.

28:59.147 --> 29:01.513
Minnie's symptoms
are consistent with a tapeworm.

29:01.515 --> 29:04.850
And it's an actual thing.

29:04.852 --> 29:06.819
Look.

29:06.821 --> 29:09.155
- Yep. Told you.
- Oh, my God.

29:09.157 --> 29:11.023
Minnie's asked for antibiotics twice.

29:11.025 --> 29:13.492
Wait. So I made the diagnosis?

29:13.494 --> 29:14.994
Could someone really be that desperate

29:14.996 --> 29:16.361
that they would infect themselves?

29:16.363 --> 29:18.798
Maybe. Or maybe someone she trusts

29:18.800 --> 29:20.833
is so desperate that he'd do it to her.

29:20.835 --> 29:22.051
Todd.

29:22.053 --> 29:23.586
She has no idea what's in any

29:23.588 --> 29:25.304
of those supplements he gives her.

29:38.652 --> 29:39.735
Hey!

29:39.737 --> 29:42.071
- Hey, Shelby.
- Minnie!

29:42.073 --> 29:43.772
Oh, excuse me. I'll be right back.

29:43.774 --> 29:46.859
Dr. Sacani, what a happy accident

29:46.861 --> 29:48.744
finding you in my hotel.
Skinnie tangerita?

29:48.746 --> 29:51.747
Thank you.

29:51.749 --> 29:53.199
- To Greenland.
- Iceland.

29:53.201 --> 29:55.117
That was a joke.

29:55.119 --> 29:57.119
This tastes like tang.

29:57.121 --> 29:58.787
Yeah, let's get something else.

29:58.789 --> 30:01.040
I love tang.

30:01.042 --> 30:02.541
Two more.

30:02.543 --> 30:04.627
So we say, "pack your knives and go,"

30:04.629 --> 30:07.263
and she goes,
but she forgets her knives.

30:07.265 --> 30:08.631
- No!
- Yes.

30:08.633 --> 30:11.300
- And then?
- We mailed them to her.

30:11.302 --> 30:13.018
Wow.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.270
- Uh, Minnie...
- Hey.

30:14.272 --> 30:16.555
This is Gail Simmons
from <i>Top Chef Masters.</i>

30:16.557 --> 30:18.057
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:18.059 --> 30:19.808
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

30:19.810 --> 30:21.477
- The drinks are free, right?
- Uh-huh.

30:21.479 --> 30:23.812
Perfect.

30:23.814 --> 30:25.898
Okay, uh, Minnie,
I need to ask you something,

30:25.900 --> 30:27.616
and it's gonna sound a little strange.

30:27.618 --> 30:29.652
- Okay.
- When you were in Mexico,

30:29.654 --> 30:31.403
did you deliberately
infect yourself with a tapeworm

30:31.405 --> 30:32.571
in order to lose weight?

30:32.573 --> 30:34.606
Oh, my God, no.

30:34.608 --> 30:36.825
That's disgusting.

30:36.827 --> 30:38.744
The only worm I ever swallowed
was in a bottle of mescal

30:38.746 --> 30:40.129
when I was 20.

30:40.131 --> 30:41.947
Wait. That wasn't a tapeworm, was it?

30:41.949 --> 30:44.216
- No, not a tapeworm.
- Okay, good.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.804
So the rich old man died,

30:48.806 --> 30:51.790
and the administrator
threw Hank under the bus

30:51.792 --> 30:53.809
because it turned out he was an ad...

30:53.811 --> 30:55.761
'cause it turned out he was a trustee.

30:55.763 --> 30:58.264
Well, no wonder Hank's
so skittish about hospitals.

30:58.266 --> 31:01.466
But medically, he was right
to take care of the boy.

31:02.852 --> 31:05.271
I know that. You know that.

31:05.273 --> 31:08.524
Apparently, even the hospital
board in Brooklyn knew that,

31:08.526 --> 31:11.944
but somebody had to take
the fall, and you know who.

31:11.946 --> 31:14.780
- Hank.
- Hank.

31:14.782 --> 31:17.583
Is that what brought him
to the Hamptons?

31:17.585 --> 31:20.252
That and his brother, Evan.

31:20.254 --> 31:22.154
- Have you met Evan?
- I have.

31:22.156 --> 31:23.872
Right. Curly hair.

31:23.874 --> 31:26.041
- Mm-hmm.
- Where was I?

31:26.043 --> 31:27.826
Oh, right, dead trustee.

31:27.828 --> 31:31.430
So Hank gets fired...

31:31.432 --> 31:33.299
No job, no hope.

31:33.301 --> 31:34.967
- Guess what happened next.
- I don't know.

31:34.969 --> 31:37.102
- His fiancee dumped him.
- What?

31:37.104 --> 31:38.971
Did I mention he had a fiancee?

31:38.973 --> 31:41.640
- You did not.
- He had a fiancee...

31:41.642 --> 31:43.475
to be married... to.

31:43.477 --> 31:45.527
- Right.
- Right. So...

31:45.529 --> 31:47.696
Hank got fired... No job, no hope.

31:47.698 --> 31:49.348
Guess what happened next.

31:49.350 --> 31:53.369
- His fiancee dumped him.
- His fiancee dumped him.

31:53.371 --> 31:54.653
- Minnie, over here.
- Over here, Minnie.

31:54.655 --> 31:55.988
Have you ever heard of something called

31:55.990 --> 31:57.356
"the Mexican tapeworm diet"?

31:57.358 --> 31:59.625
Sure. Dumb chicks on spring break

31:59.627 --> 32:01.493
go down to Mazatlan...

32:01.495 --> 32:02.878
hold up. You think I did that to Minnie?

32:02.880 --> 32:06.081
- Did you?
- Okay, couple of things...

32:06.083 --> 32:07.333
first, if there weren't people here,

32:07.335 --> 32:08.550
I'd be hitting you right now.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.469
- Oh, okay.
- Second...

32:10.471 --> 32:12.471
I don't just care about Minnie's
health because it's my job.

32:12.473 --> 32:15.540
I care because I love her.
She's strong. She's smart.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.893
She's successful, and she trusts me.

32:17.895 --> 32:20.012
So there's no way
she's got a tapeworm, dude,

32:20.014 --> 32:21.213
not on my watch.

32:21.215 --> 32:22.648
Wait a second.

32:22.650 --> 32:25.717
That night in Mexico,
she wasn't on your watch.

32:25.719 --> 32:27.987
Can I see that picture of her
at that bar again?

32:27.989 --> 32:29.822
Yeah.

32:32.442 --> 32:35.411
You know, other than that night,
she's been perfect.

32:35.413 --> 32:37.613
She is perfect.

32:37.615 --> 32:39.398
Look at her.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.117
Minnie.

32:50.348 --> 32:51.866
She's going into anaphylactic shock.

32:51.868 --> 32:54.852
- What do we do?
- Calm down, Todd. I got this.

32:58.741 --> 33:00.124
Ow!

33:05.865 --> 33:09.667
Oh, my stomach hurts.

33:09.669 --> 33:11.719
Why is this happening to me, Hank?

33:11.721 --> 33:14.755
I think I know, but we need
to get you an endoscopy.

33:20.395 --> 33:22.813
Okay...

33:22.815 --> 33:25.933
this is what's in your intestine.

33:25.935 --> 33:27.602
Anisakis worms

33:27.604 --> 33:29.070
from the shellfish you ate in Mexico.

33:29.072 --> 33:30.988
- Calamari.
- Fried food is the devil.

33:30.990 --> 33:32.857
Well, this wasn't friend enough.

33:32.859 --> 33:34.241
That night, you weren't sick
from drinking.

33:34.243 --> 33:35.559
You were sick because
your body was trying

33:35.561 --> 33:36.911
to get rid of the parasites.

33:36.913 --> 33:39.330
- Only I wasn't that successful.
- No.

33:39.332 --> 33:41.065
And then they traveled
to your intestine,

33:41.067 --> 33:43.334
hence the abdominal pain,
the G.I. symptoms,

33:43.336 --> 33:45.453
and eventually,
your gastroallergic reaction

33:45.455 --> 33:48.089
- of hives and anaphylaxis.
- Sick.

33:48.091 --> 33:50.174
Yeah, and if you let it go, dead.

33:50.176 --> 33:51.792
But fortunately, we caught it early,

33:51.794 --> 33:53.127
and a few more days of albendazole

33:53.129 --> 33:54.845
- should clear things up.
- Thank you.

33:54.847 --> 33:57.682
Guess I need to keep
a closer eye on you.

33:57.684 --> 34:00.518
Actually, I think it's the opposite.

34:00.520 --> 34:03.054
What do you mean "opposite"?

34:03.056 --> 34:04.305
You don't know what "opposite" means?

34:04.307 --> 34:05.556
Of course I know what it means, numbnut.

34:05.558 --> 34:06.857
I'm asking for the deeper implication.

34:06.859 --> 34:08.476
Oh, right. Sorry.

34:08.478 --> 34:12.429
I mean, instead of you
being my willpower,

34:12.431 --> 34:14.532
I should be my own willpower.

34:14.534 --> 34:16.817
I don't need you to be my trainer,

34:16.819 --> 34:19.937
slash-nutritionist, slash-life coach.

34:19.938 --> 34:22.072
I just need you to be my boyfriend.

34:22.074 --> 34:24.440
I got this.

34:26.911 --> 34:29.630
I'm gonna leave-slash-go.

34:34.803 --> 34:37.888
Is he sleeping?

34:45.063 --> 34:47.898
Are those sustainably farmed?

34:47.900 --> 34:50.317
Uh...

34:50.319 --> 34:52.636
Well, the grower said
no ladybugs were harmed

34:52.638 --> 34:54.321
when they were cut.

34:54.322 --> 34:57.992
Your brother said
that I was a walking time bomb.

34:57.994 --> 35:00.644
If it weren't
for your umbrella stabbing me,

35:00.646 --> 35:03.647
he wouldn't have found
my aortic dissection.

35:03.649 --> 35:06.417
So, in a way, I saved your life.

35:06.419 --> 35:08.669
No, you didn't do it. It was the wind.

35:12.124 --> 35:15.626
But there's no wind now, so...

35:15.628 --> 35:16.994
Give me your spiel.

35:16.996 --> 35:19.013
Is this really the time for politics?

35:19.015 --> 35:21.348
Yeah. It's always time.

35:21.350 --> 35:23.768
Come on, what's your platform?

35:23.770 --> 35:25.502
I thought you knew my platform...

35:25.504 --> 35:27.388
unchecked growth
and destroying the habitats

35:27.390 --> 35:29.440
of adorable woodland creatures, right?

35:29.442 --> 35:31.776
No, I'm... I'm serious.

35:31.778 --> 35:35.980
We may not agree,
but the least I can do is to...

35:35.982 --> 35:38.399
to hear you out.

35:39.852 --> 35:41.285
I'm running

35:41.287 --> 35:43.370
against Blythe Ballard's
handpicked candidate

35:43.372 --> 35:44.739
because Blythe has a monopoly

35:44.741 --> 35:46.857
on the power
of the Hamptons village council.

35:46.859 --> 35:49.326
And I'm a guy who thinks
that when it comes to power,

35:49.328 --> 35:51.629
there should be more than one voice.

35:51.631 --> 35:54.632
Hmm. Maybe we're not so different.

35:56.051 --> 36:00.671
Can I get a picture with you
for the campaign?

36:00.673 --> 36:01.889
Sure.

36:01.891 --> 36:03.874
Yes! Really?

36:03.876 --> 36:05.392
- Awesome. Here.
- Hmm?

36:05.394 --> 36:06.677
Here you go, Paige. Do you mind?

36:06.679 --> 36:08.229
Not at all.

36:08.231 --> 36:10.481
A very wise man once said
that with great power

36:10.483 --> 36:11.599
comes great responsibility.

36:11.601 --> 36:13.267
I love that quote. I live by it.

36:13.269 --> 36:16.487
Yeah. Voltaire said that in 1832.

36:16.489 --> 36:17.738
That's a very good guess.

36:17.740 --> 36:21.492
No, it was actually Uncle Ben
in <i>Spider-man.</i>

36:21.494 --> 36:23.527
I was wrong. We are very different.

36:24.664 --> 36:27.281
Not bad.

36:27.283 --> 36:29.867
- It's a little backlit.
- I can't do this anymore.

36:29.869 --> 36:32.169
Don't beat yourself up.

36:32.171 --> 36:33.537
You're not a professional photographer.

36:33.539 --> 36:36.373
No, I can't do the
political-wife thing anymore...

36:36.375 --> 36:39.076
just stand there smiling quietly

36:39.078 --> 36:41.462
at all the meet and greets
and all the photo ops

36:41.464 --> 36:43.180
and the platform speeches.

36:43.182 --> 36:45.266
I... I did it for my dad his whole career,

36:45.268 --> 36:47.134
and I am just not ready to do it again.

36:47.136 --> 36:50.054
I have work, and I have school,
and I have my internship.

36:50.056 --> 36:52.640
And you... you are the one
who convinced me

36:52.642 --> 36:53.691
to go for all of it.

36:53.693 --> 36:55.559
Ow.

36:55.561 --> 36:57.061
Sorry.

36:57.063 --> 36:59.980
Paige, I'm sorry that you feel

36:59.982 --> 37:01.765
you have to stand there quietly.

37:01.767 --> 37:04.318
You don't. You can say
whatever's on your mind.

37:04.320 --> 37:07.905
Okay, but that's usually,
"look at all these people.

37:07.907 --> 37:09.957
How long till this is over?"

37:09.959 --> 37:12.660
- Oh.
- Mm.

37:12.662 --> 37:14.044
Why didn't you say something sooner?

37:14.046 --> 37:16.380
Because I know how important
this is to you.

37:16.382 --> 37:19.133
Yeah, but it's not life and death.

37:19.135 --> 37:20.885
I know you're always there for me.

37:20.887 --> 37:23.220
So, if you don't want to literally,

37:23.222 --> 37:26.140
physically be there
all the time, it's fine.

37:26.142 --> 37:28.259
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:28.261 --> 37:31.645
So, like, you don't
need me there this afternoon?

37:31.647 --> 37:34.098
Need you? No.

37:34.100 --> 37:37.184
Want you?

37:37.186 --> 37:38.686
Always.

37:42.324 --> 37:43.741
- Hank.
- Hey.

37:43.743 --> 37:45.526
Uh, it's not Monday
till tomorrow, right?

37:45.528 --> 37:47.361
I know. I'm not here
to ask you for your answer,

37:47.363 --> 37:49.079
just to say I know
what you're going through.

37:49.081 --> 37:50.414
Uh, you're a concierge doctor

37:50.416 --> 37:51.749
who's being courted by Symphony too?

37:51.751 --> 37:53.500
No, but I am a patient.

37:53.502 --> 37:56.086
And so I wouldn't associate
with a company

37:56.088 --> 37:57.487
that doesn't put patients first.

37:57.489 --> 37:58.923
Name one hospital that doesn't say

37:58.925 --> 38:00.374
they put patients first.

38:00.376 --> 38:02.492
Well, it's easy to say it.
Symphony actually does it.

38:02.494 --> 38:06.547
Look, during residency,
I was at a big-name hospital

38:06.549 --> 38:09.633
on an E.R. rotation,
and an aids patient came in...

38:09.635 --> 38:11.468
homeless, uninsured.

38:11.470 --> 38:14.305
And the administrator said
she was low priority

38:14.307 --> 38:15.940
because she was dying.

38:15.942 --> 38:19.360
And I thought to myself,
"when did the health care system

38:19.362 --> 38:21.511
become the health we-don't-care system?"

38:21.513 --> 38:25.449
And I quit, and I got angry
and cynical...

38:25.451 --> 38:27.534
So cynical I went to business school.

38:27.536 --> 38:32.039
When I was there,
I met the founder of Symphony,

38:32.041 --> 38:34.375
who said three magic words to me...

38:34.377 --> 38:36.460
"medicine before money."

38:36.462 --> 38:39.496
And I trusted him,
and I returned to medicine,

38:39.498 --> 38:41.382
and I've never been happier.

38:43.051 --> 38:46.470
Your story is weirdly similar to mine.

38:46.472 --> 38:48.255
I don't think that's weird.

38:48.257 --> 38:51.258
Okay...

38:51.260 --> 38:54.561
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.

38:54.563 --> 38:56.046
No. Wait.

38:57.649 --> 38:59.516
Forget tomorrow.

38:59.518 --> 39:02.069
I'll have my attorney
look over the contract tonight.

39:02.071 --> 39:03.570
Why waste any more time?

39:03.572 --> 39:06.490
It's gonna be such a pleasure
doing business with you.

39:06.492 --> 39:08.801
- I can't wait.
- Me too.

39:20.097 --> 39:22.298
I'm just glad that you came,
and thank you.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.634
And nice to meet you as well,
and you, sir.

39:24.636 --> 39:26.386
That's the first thing I'm gonna change.

39:26.388 --> 39:28.605
Oh, excuse me for one second. Hey!

39:28.607 --> 39:30.023
Hey!

39:30.025 --> 39:32.475
Oh, yes, "hey." Yeah, very good.

39:32.477 --> 39:33.977
I'm glad you guys could make it.

39:33.979 --> 39:35.428
Yeah, got to be supportive.

39:35.430 --> 39:37.564
And, given the last time, prepared.

39:37.566 --> 39:40.150
Ah, very funny,
but unnecessary this time.

39:40.152 --> 39:41.651
You can't get injured on a balloon.

39:41.653 --> 39:42.869
Divya.

39:42.871 --> 39:44.237
Sandra, hey.

39:44.239 --> 39:46.706
Hank, Evan, this is Sandra,
my next-door neighbor.

39:46.708 --> 39:48.041
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

39:48.043 --> 39:49.209
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

39:49.211 --> 39:51.161
- And her son, Max.
- Hey, what's up, Max?

39:51.163 --> 39:53.463
- Hey, man.
- Can I have a balloon?

39:53.465 --> 39:56.633
- Oh...
- That depends. Can you vote?

39:56.635 --> 39:58.051
I'm just kidding. You know what,
my little constituent?

39:58.053 --> 39:59.803
You can have as many balloons
as you would like.

39:59.805 --> 40:01.004
They're right over there. Is that cool?

40:01.006 --> 40:02.305
Go ahead, honey. I'm watching.

40:02.307 --> 40:05.341
So I'm staying with my sister
in Mattituck.

40:05.343 --> 40:07.126
- How about you?
- I'm at the Hampt-Inn.

40:07.128 --> 40:09.345
But not for long.
Thanks again for your help.

40:09.347 --> 40:13.266
I much prefer a healthy kid
driving me crazy to a sick one.

40:13.268 --> 40:15.435
Being a single parent
must be pretty hard.

40:15.437 --> 40:17.604
Well, being any kind of parent is hard,

40:17.606 --> 40:19.939
but it completes you
in a way that nothing else does.

40:19.941 --> 40:20.990
It fills you with...

40:20.992 --> 40:22.859
Max, stop that! You'll choke!

40:22.861 --> 40:24.327
I'm sorry. I got to go. Bye.

40:24.329 --> 40:25.811
Yeah. No, it's a good thing
you can't get injured

40:25.813 --> 40:26.996
by a balloon.

40:26.998 --> 40:29.032
Well, you're not supposed to eat them.

40:29.034 --> 40:32.335
- Hey, Jeremiah, no tie.
- Not so loud, please.

40:32.337 --> 40:34.204
Is someone hungover?

40:34.206 --> 40:36.289
I prefer the term "glutamine rebound."

40:36.291 --> 40:37.841
Wha...?

40:37.843 --> 40:43.129
Front door, back door, deadbolt, garage.

40:43.131 --> 40:44.881
W... wait. You're staying with Jeremiah?

40:44.883 --> 40:47.267
I intruded on the guesthouse
last summer.

40:47.269 --> 40:49.219
I don't want to intrude
on newlyweds this summer.

40:49.221 --> 40:51.304
And Jeremiah has so much room.

40:51.306 --> 40:54.840
15,214 square feet,
not including the garage.

40:54.842 --> 40:56.342
I'm gonna go back to sleep.

40:56.344 --> 40:59.362
Just, uh, be quiet
when you come in, please.

41:03.702 --> 41:06.069
Wife! What are you doing here?

41:06.071 --> 41:09.122
Ah, I was at the printers
getting the mock-up

41:09.124 --> 41:11.074
of my auction catalog
to take to Russel's,

41:11.076 --> 41:12.825
- and I just couldn't...
- Resist stopping by?

41:12.827 --> 41:14.911
- Find any parking.
- Oh.

41:14.913 --> 41:16.246
I'm over there.

41:16.248 --> 41:18.882
Well, cool. I'm still glad you came.

41:18.884 --> 41:21.501
- I'd love to see the catalog.
- Yeah.

41:21.503 --> 41:23.670
Paige, what do you mean
"my auction catalog"?

41:23.672 --> 41:25.555
Well, technically it's Russel's,

41:25.557 --> 41:27.140
but I'm the one who did all the work.

41:27.142 --> 41:31.177
Did all the work... you mean,
like, going room by room?

41:31.179 --> 41:33.146
- Mm-hmm.
- And describing everything?

41:33.148 --> 41:35.381
Yeah. It's called
"detailing the provenance."

41:35.383 --> 41:37.383
You have to do it for every auction.

41:40.104 --> 41:42.238
It's called "detailing the provenance."

41:42.240 --> 41:44.741
They do it for every auction.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:44.743 --> 41:47.076
What assurance have we
that dangling the contents

41:47.078 --> 41:48.611
of Shadow Pond in front of Milos

41:48.613 --> 41:51.247
will cause him to show his hand?

41:51.249 --> 41:52.832
None.

41:52.834 --> 41:55.668
But if it works, we get Milos
and whatever he's been after.

41:55.670 --> 42:00.206
And if it doesn't, we still get Milos.

42:00.208 --> 42:01.925
So what do you think?

42:04.612 --> 42:08.709
I think... we change the plan.
