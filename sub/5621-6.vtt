00:18.552 --> 00:20.019
Now I know that all of you
are expecting

00:20.021 --> 00:22.354
a patented Mitch Grinder
closing argument.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.856
Well, today...

00:23.858 --> 00:26.158
I don't have one.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.660
(murmuring)
Because I don't need one.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.863
Instead, I'd like
to take this time

00:30.865 --> 00:34.233
to thank the little people
that helped me shock the world

00:34.235 --> 00:37.369
and vigorously get this man off.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.872
I want to thank my clerks
and paralegals,

00:39.874 --> 00:42.941
who work so tirelessly
behind the scenes...

00:47.882 --> 00:49.581
but one in particular.

00:54.088 --> 00:58.724
(hoarsely):
Matt... "The Fuss" Fusfeld,

00:58.726 --> 01:02.327
a blind and deaf paralegal

01:02.329 --> 01:06.865
who sees and hears more
with his heart

01:06.867 --> 01:10.269
than he ever could
with his useless eyes and ears.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.737
This is for you, sir.

01:11.739 --> 01:15.107
Everyone knows how hard I grind.

01:15.109 --> 01:18.210
But what they don't know...

01:18.212 --> 01:23.082
is that you grind
even harder behind me.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.306
(sporadic slow-clapping)

01:27.955 --> 01:30.022
¶ ¶

01:34.261 --> 01:35.961
(TV clicks off)

01:35.963 --> 01:37.062
(sniffles)

01:37.064 --> 01:38.064
Dad, are you okay?

01:38.065 --> 01:39.231
This one always gets me.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.732
Stew.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.267
Put your arm around Dad.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.136
Comfort him, he's hurting.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.698
He's gonna be fine.
He needs you.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.044
(clears throat)

01:56.217 --> 01:58.550
That feels great.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.953
Thanks, Dean.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.489
How did you make yourself
cry like that?
I don't know.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.791
Dad, how did you
make yourself cry?
It just happened.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.759
Exactly, genuine emotion.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.128
You think it's genuine?

02:09.130 --> 02:10.729
What you saw was Mitch crying,

02:10.731 --> 02:12.731
but what you felt was
Mitch trying not to cry.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.233
Suddenly I feel
like I'm gonna cry.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.601
Aw, come here.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.170
Oh, no, I didn't
mean like that.
DEAN: Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.172
Don't fight it.
(quietly): Just let it happen.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.875
(sniffles)

02:28.816 --> 02:30.349
STEWART:
Hey, there he is.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.984
Look at him...
Little guy all set

02:31.986 --> 02:33.285
for his first day of stage crew.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.520
You look great.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.155
You excited?
Yeah.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.357
You should see how he holds
a flashlight in his mouth.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.592
I mean...
You didn't get a part
in the school play?

02:40.594 --> 02:42.361
No, auditions haven't
happened yet.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.696
He decided to follow in the
footsteps of his old man.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.699
Stew, you did crew?
I did, I did, and
I am not offended

02:47.701 --> 02:49.801
that you don't remember
because when you're a crewman,

02:49.803 --> 02:51.336
doing your job right
means... Ethan?

02:51.338 --> 02:53.505
No one notices.
No one notices.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.840
Cool, right?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.508
So cool.
Well...

02:56.510 --> 02:58.143
STEWART: We got so good at
moving around the stage

02:58.145 --> 02:59.378
without being seen or heard,

02:59.380 --> 03:00.979
we became known
as the Shadow Boys.

03:00.981 --> 03:01.980
DEBBIE: Ooh,
the Shadow Boys.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.849
Tell me more.
Come here.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.852
All joking aside, and
I know you're joking,

03:06.854 --> 03:08.453
people talk about actors
like they're the heroes.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.556
The crew is the real hero.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.357
That's exactly right...
I mean, Ethan,

03:12.359 --> 03:14.159
would you rather be a guy
who takes all the credit

03:14.161 --> 03:15.294
or a guy who does all the work?

03:15.296 --> 03:17.529
So you're the real heroes,

03:17.531 --> 03:20.866
but they're the ones
that get treated like one.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.367
Doesn't seem right, does it?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.369
I mean, we win all the awards,

03:24.371 --> 03:27.639
and they...
hand us all the awards.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.675
Because they're on the crew
of the award show.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.210
I mean, I do like
getting awards.

03:31.212 --> 03:35.080
Oh, I think someone's been
bitten by the acting bug.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.683
Well, I think maybe he was
bitten by the crew bug, uh,

03:37.685 --> 03:39.851
just a little... little sooner
than that, little before, right?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.853
Uh...
See? I sense some hesitation.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.488
You know, being an actor,

03:43.490 --> 03:45.324
there's a lot of rejection,
a lot of heartbreak.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.425
But you can't make
decisions out of fear.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.893
It's like Dad used to say.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.695
"Swing for the fences.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.431
You want something bad enough,
anything's possible."

03:52.433 --> 03:53.665
Wait, who said that?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.334
Dad said that? Our dad?

03:55.336 --> 03:57.269
DEAN: Oh yeah, all the time.
I'd be like, "Dad, back off."

03:57.271 --> 03:58.904
I get it, I can do anything."

03:58.906 --> 04:00.872
Huh.
But you know,

04:00.874 --> 04:02.341
we might find that
Ethan has a true talent.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.276
Well, I think
we've already found that...

04:04.278 --> 04:05.510
It's the-the flashlight
in the mouth thing.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.246
And nobody would argue that.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.081
But it begs the question.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.683
If he's that talented with
a flashlight in his mouth,

04:11.685 --> 04:14.620
what would happen if we tossed
a little Shakespeare in there?

04:14.622 --> 04:15.622
(scoffs)

04:15.623 --> 04:17.356
Okay, I have an idea.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.124
How about we let Ethan decide
what Ethan wants to do?

04:19.126 --> 04:21.526
Sweetie?

04:25.399 --> 04:27.866
So he just turns his back
on the crew, just like that?

04:27.868 --> 04:30.369
What if he doesn't
get a part?
Then I guess
he doesn't get a part.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.371
A little dose of failure is not
the worst thing in the world.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.306
You know, you get scuffed up
a little bit... it's life.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.408
Oh, where'd you learn that? On
the wrong side of the tracks?

04:36.410 --> 04:39.611
Okay, you know what, North Boise
has some very rough patches.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.247
(sighs) I mean, you're really
okay setting him up for failure?

04:42.249 --> 04:43.882
Honey, I really don't think
the stakes are that high.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.150
It's a middle school play.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.252
And who knows?
He might not fail.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.954
How could he fail?
You heard what Dad said...

04:48.956 --> 04:50.656
"You swing for the fences,
anything's possible."

04:50.658 --> 04:53.325
Oh, yeah, that bothered you,
huh? I saw that.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.626
You know, my dad didn't
say things like that to me.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.961
My dad said very
different things to me.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.396
My dad said,
"Know your limits."

04:57.398 --> 04:58.897
In fact, he pointed
them out to me.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.299
He said, "Here are your
limits, don't go past them."

05:00.301 --> 05:02.301
Sweetie, I know that
you're feeling very upset

05:02.303 --> 05:04.303
that Ethan doesn't want
to follow in your footsteps

05:04.305 --> 05:07.339
and be a Shadow Boy, but, I
mean, maybe it's good, you know?

05:07.341 --> 05:09.207
(chuckling): Maybe it's
not the coolest thing.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.312
I didn't...
Oh, wow, Deb.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.347
Hon, you know I'm
vulnerable right now.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.915
Well...
I'm not feeling...

05:16.917 --> 05:18.784
No, you're cool.
Uh, you can't... you
can't take that back.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.319
You put that out there.

05:20.321 --> 05:22.421
You know, hon,
I-I didn't...

05:22.423 --> 05:23.455
I'm not talking about you.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.790
I'm just talking
about the brotherhood.

05:24.792 --> 05:25.791
No, but you talk about
one Shadow Boy,

05:25.793 --> 05:26.925
you talk about us all.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.294
You know, we're a group.
Wow.

05:29.296 --> 05:30.462
You can't just
p-put 'em down,

05:30.464 --> 05:31.997
say, "Oh, I'm not
talking about you."

05:31.999 --> 05:33.799
You know,
we're-we're a team.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.534
STEWART:
<i>All right,</i>

05:35.536 --> 05:37.169
so if there aren't
any other questions,

05:37.171 --> 05:38.470
uh, let's move on.
I have a question.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.505
Does anyone want
to trade lunches?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.474
I kind of panicked and ordered
outside my comfort zone.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.209
No, Todd, learn from this.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.779
Uh, okay, so the next case
is<i> Bradford v. McKenna.</i>

05:47.781 --> 05:49.514
That's the, uh, parking
lot fender bender.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.883
Uh, now, since our client
did back up into their car,

05:51.885 --> 05:53.685
I think we should
probably settle.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.121
That does seem like what most
lawyers would... would do.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.989
Dad, do you think that's
what I should do?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.791
Yeah, sure.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.327
'Cause the other way to
go is we chase the win.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.696
You know, I bet on myself,
take the big swing.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.131
Okay.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.399
Do you have any...
any advice for me

06:07.401 --> 06:08.633
on whether I should even swing?

06:08.635 --> 06:10.335
And if I do, what
I should swing for?

06:10.337 --> 06:12.170
I don't even know what the hell
you're talking about.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.406
Well, Dad, let's...
let's say I swing.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.742
Um, should I have,
a-a goal, you know,

06:16.744 --> 06:18.543
or a-a target
in mind?

06:18.545 --> 06:19.644
Some sort of, like, a...

06:19.646 --> 06:21.646
like, a chain-link
barrier

06:21.648 --> 06:23.548
or, like, a... like,
a white picket thing?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.584
For what it's worth, I
took a really big swing

06:25.586 --> 06:27.552
with this lunch order, and
I am really regretting it.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.420
Seems like we should settle.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.422
Then we all agree.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.989
Of course.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.991
What was I, uh...
what was I thinking?

06:32.993 --> 06:36.361
¶ ¶

06:36.363 --> 06:38.263
(crying):
And that man's name...

06:38.265 --> 06:39.731
was Luther.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.268
Something like that?

06:43.270 --> 06:44.536
Something very much like that.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.771
Uh, one small note.

06:45.773 --> 06:46.773
The crying?

06:46.774 --> 06:49.274
Yeah, you were acting sad,

06:49.276 --> 06:51.443
instead of being sad.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.544
Great actors don't act.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.045
They be.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.180
Does that make sense?

06:55.182 --> 06:56.615
I get it up here,

06:56.617 --> 06:58.083
but it just hasn't made
its way down here yet.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.418
Does that make sense?

06:59.420 --> 07:01.420
Let me answer your question
with a story.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.890
You may be surprised to know
that before I ever acted a word,

07:04.892 --> 07:06.858
I was a star quarterback
on the school team.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.395
And the week before the state
championship, I broke my ankle.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.596
In practice?
No.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.265
Without going into

07:13.267 --> 07:14.699
too much detail,
I was having sex

07:14.701 --> 07:16.268
with the hottest girl
in the school

07:16.270 --> 07:17.436
in her parents' shower
and I slipped.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.970
And I knew then

07:18.972 --> 07:20.772
that my playing days were over

07:20.774 --> 07:22.574
and that I would have to learn

07:22.576 --> 07:24.876
to make a living
with my two hands...

07:24.878 --> 07:26.211
through acting.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.446
You must've been scared.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.448
I was. And sad.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.716
So when the school play
rolled around,

07:31.718 --> 07:33.585
I was able to tap into that

07:33.587 --> 07:36.455
and crush my audition
as Ichabod Crane,

07:36.457 --> 07:38.623
the scaredest, saddest man

07:38.625 --> 07:40.058
in Sleepy Hollow.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.461
My heart's going like
a jackhammer right now.

07:42.463 --> 07:44.629
That's good! That's what
it should be doing, man.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.231
You need to find something

07:46.233 --> 07:48.667
that rocks your world
and use it.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.669
Well, I'm only 12.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.304
I don't think
I have anything like that.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.573
Well, the only place
you can find it

07:54.575 --> 07:56.341
is on the stage.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.677
But didn't you say
that I need to have it

07:58.679 --> 08:00.479
so I could use it
to get on that stage?

08:00.481 --> 08:01.813
Ah!

08:01.815 --> 08:03.682
The actor's riddle.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.450
Hey. What's, uh...

08:05.452 --> 08:07.018
what's going on in here?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.920
Uncle Dean's helping me
with my monologue for tomorrow.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.489
Yeah?
Kid's a natural.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.656
Huge loss for the crew,

08:11.658 --> 08:13.158
but a big win for the theater.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.292
Crew's still part
of the theater.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.528
Yeah.
Let's try it again.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.598
Okay, I'll, uh...
I'll just leave you guys to it.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.633
Probably just be getting
in the way, so...
Oh, Stew,

08:21.635 --> 08:24.102
you wouldn't be getting in
our way. We could use the help.
Yeah?

08:24.104 --> 08:25.670
Yeah, yeah.
Do you want to dim the lights?

08:25.672 --> 08:26.838
I'd love to.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.875
All those years on crew,

08:29.877 --> 08:31.917
and he still
doesn't understand dimming.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.150
I'm confused. What do you mean,
you didn't get the part?

08:39.152 --> 08:41.052
This is what
I was worried about.
Okay, calm down.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.387
It's not the end of the world.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.688
It's one part.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.657
This part?

08:45.659 --> 08:46.992
"12 years old,
looks like he's nine,

08:46.994 --> 08:48.293
"skinny, precocious,

08:48.295 --> 08:49.628
"articulate redhead,

08:49.630 --> 08:50.962
wise beyond his years"?

08:50.964 --> 08:52.297
Somebody beat him out for this?

08:52.299 --> 08:53.565
It's so in my wheelhouse.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.567
I don't get it.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.067
It is...

08:56.069 --> 08:57.569
very much in your wheelhouse.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.004
But there will be
other plays, honey.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.338
Don't get discouraged.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.406
No, get outraged!

09:01.408 --> 09:02.741
Because something stinks.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.642
What are you talking about?

09:03.644 --> 09:04.709
Stew, we are going to get

09:04.711 --> 09:05.911
to the bottom of this.

09:05.913 --> 09:06.978
Dean, we're not going to get

09:06.980 --> 09:08.547
to the bottom of anything. Okay?

09:08.549 --> 09:09.814
Ethan's been through enough.
Now it's time

09:09.816 --> 09:11.583
to welcome him back
with open arms

09:11.585 --> 09:13.351
into a group that never
turns anyone away.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.586
You still get to be on stage

09:14.588 --> 09:15.554
for all the most
important parts.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.821
Before and after the play,

09:16.823 --> 09:18.023
and in-between the scenes.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.158
No. That is not

09:20.160 --> 09:21.526
good enough, not anymore.

09:21.528 --> 09:22.594
Not here.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.229
From where I stand,

09:24.231 --> 09:26.631
this school play has taken
an ugly plot twist.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.935
And it's up to me...

09:32.706 --> 09:34.573
to rewrite the third act.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.745
The backyard is fenced in.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.081
There's a fence around the yard.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.787
And that man's name was...

09:48.789 --> 09:50.055
Line.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.423
"Luther."

09:51.425 --> 09:53.358
"Luther" is the line, Blaine.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.226
You're supposed to be off book.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.595
Sorry, Sandy.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.130
No, I'm sorry.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.765
I jumped on you
pretty hard, there,

10:00.767 --> 10:02.434
and you didn't deserve that.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.768
DEAN:
Or did he?

10:03.770 --> 10:06.438
'Cause that is one of the most

10:06.440 --> 10:09.441
pathetic examples of acting
I've ever seen.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.809
Although, Blaine,
it's not your fault.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.243
You're just terribly miscast.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.044
Yeah, I get it.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.646
Dean Sanderson.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.448
It's been a long time.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.450
Do we know each other?

10:17.451 --> 10:19.050
That depends.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.486
Does the name Sandy Malmuth
ring a bell?

10:21.488 --> 10:23.822
Malmuth... Sandy...

10:23.824 --> 10:26.725
Malmuth...
I need more.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.627
Okay.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.629
Well, then, what if I told you
that this isn't the first time

10:30.631 --> 10:31.896
we've shared this stage
together?

10:31.898 --> 10:33.098
Wait, that might be helpful.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.500
Nope, lost it.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.635
That's funny.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.269
Because I also lost something,

10:38.271 --> 10:40.839
once upon a time.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.674
The role that I was
born to play,

10:42.676 --> 10:44.442
was cast to play.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.244
Until I broke my ankle

10:46.246 --> 10:47.846
and took it from you.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.280
So you do remember.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.448
Ichabod Crane...

10:50.450 --> 10:51.850
(accent):
The saddest,

10:51.852 --> 10:53.118
scaredest man

10:53.120 --> 10:54.653
in Sleepy Hollow.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.121
What?

10:56.123 --> 10:58.023
That's the accent
I was going to use.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.824
Thank God you never had
that opportunity.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.826
It's regional and
historically accurate.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.194
Is that what this is about,
Malmuth?

11:03.196 --> 11:05.430
You taking revenge on me

11:05.432 --> 11:07.799
by denying my nephew
the role he was born to play?

11:07.801 --> 11:10.035
That's quite an accusation.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.671
And one that I do not care for.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.873
Shame on you, sir,

11:14.875 --> 11:16.841
for implying that
I would compromise

11:16.843 --> 11:19.210
the integrity of the theater.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.513
I am not implying anything.

11:23.717 --> 11:27.018
I'm flat-out saying it.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.324
BLAINE:
Uh... Sandy?

11:33.326 --> 11:34.859
What's going on?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.361
Everything's okay, Blaine.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.329
BLAINE:
Doesn't seem like it.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.565
We'll be done in a bit.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.300
This is grown-up stuff.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.702
All right.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.338
Dean, the drama teacher
isn't depriving

11:47.340 --> 11:48.873
a 12-year-old
of a part

11:48.875 --> 11:50.709
'cause of some high school
vendetta against you.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.044
No, he's depriving
the entire school

11:53.046 --> 11:54.979
of a performance for the ages.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.515
What's the move?
I don't know. Counselor?

11:57.517 --> 11:59.517
Maybe I should just help Ethan
do the thing

11:59.519 --> 12:01.519
he's wanted to do in the first
place, which is stage crew.

12:01.521 --> 12:02.821
Well, I'm not ready

12:02.823 --> 12:04.522
to roll over and die just yet.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.357
Stage crew is not
rolling over and dying.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.159
Pop... what should I do?

12:08.161 --> 12:09.928
You swing away, Deano.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.730
Really?
All right,
so who do we sue first?

12:11.732 --> 12:13.698
Malmuth, the school board,

12:13.700 --> 12:14.733
or the fat kid in the wig?

12:14.735 --> 12:16.167
I want to say... none of them?

12:16.169 --> 12:18.269
I'm going the other direction.
All of them.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.771
Attaboy, Todd.
I like that spirit.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.073
Do you?
Because if Ethan went in there

12:22.075 --> 12:24.609
and did half of what I taught
him, he earned that part.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.578
We just need proof.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.612
There's got to be a video.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.848
On Malmuth's computer.
What?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.783
Claire, how quickly can we set
up a meeting with our hacker?

12:31.785 --> 12:33.585
Uh, never, because
we don't have one.

12:33.587 --> 12:34.786
We don't? We had a whole team
of them at Stutz & Grinder.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.187
They saved our ass all the time.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.756
I took an Excel course
in college.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.023
Maybe I could do it.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.391
I have no objection to that.
Claire?

12:40.393 --> 12:41.559
You're asking me

12:41.561 --> 12:42.794
if I'm okay with Todd

12:42.796 --> 12:44.195
using his dated
spreadsheet knowledge

12:44.197 --> 12:45.930
to hack into
a drama teacher's computer?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.632
I am.
Okay.

12:47.634 --> 12:48.634
So what do you say, boss?

12:48.635 --> 12:50.201
I say we get our hands

12:50.203 --> 12:52.203
on some flame-retardant suits,

12:52.205 --> 12:56.207
because we are about
to bust through a firewall.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.979
Whose?

13:00.981 --> 13:03.882
What is this plan?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.450
DEBBIE:
<i>Maybe Todd will find something</i>

13:05.452 --> 13:07.752
on Malmuth's computer.
I mean, how secure could it be?

13:07.754 --> 13:09.988
Honey, that's what
you're asking about,
is Malmuth's computer?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.589
What?
He wants to sue
the school, babe.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.925
Oh! Okay. Well, maybe that
is taking it a little far.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.393
Right?
Yeah.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.262
I mean, this was going
so well, you know?

13:17.264 --> 13:19.264
Ethan was on the crew
and he was enjoying it,
Keep folding.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.665
Mm-hmm.
and then Dean comes in
and fills his head

13:20.667 --> 13:22.267
with pipe dreams of awards.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.469
And that's not real life.
You know what I'm saying.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.837
Yeah. You're saying
Ethan has his limits

13:25.839 --> 13:27.405
and he should know them.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.574
No. No, this is not that.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.242
Isn't it?
That is something
totally different.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.511
Is it?

13:35.348 --> 13:36.648
I think it is...

13:36.650 --> 13:38.783
I think it is.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.351
¶ ¶

13:47.828 --> 13:50.028
Okay.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.830
Uh, great. Great.

13:51.832 --> 13:52.864
Ethan... terrific.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.432
I mean, the headline says,

13:54.434 --> 13:56.167
"Boy Great at Moving Stuff
in the Dark."

13:56.169 --> 13:57.836
You know, page two...

13:57.838 --> 13:59.838
uh, the audience could hear
almost all of it.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.006
Damn it, Ethan.
No, no,
don't beat yourself up, buddy.

14:02.008 --> 14:02.974
Don't beat yourself up,
you're doing great.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.809
You're getting better at this.

14:04.811 --> 14:05.844
And we're... we're doing
it together, you know?

14:05.846 --> 14:07.212
This is fun, right?

14:07.214 --> 14:08.847
Yeah.
Hey, I got
something for you.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.616
Uh, I was gonna wait
till opening night,

14:11.618 --> 14:13.852
but, uh, you know, I'm
terrible at keeping secrets,

14:13.854 --> 14:15.019
so...

14:15.021 --> 14:18.022
Ah! Yeah? See?

14:18.024 --> 14:20.325
Got your name embroidered
on it and everything.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.893
You did?

14:21.895 --> 14:23.828
I did. The, uh...
the lettering's in black,

14:23.830 --> 14:25.063
otherwise you run the risk of...

14:25.065 --> 14:27.398
Being seen.
Being seen. You got it. Yeah!

14:27.400 --> 14:30.201
You want to, uh, try it on?
See how it fits?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.469
Maybe later.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.737
Okay, yeah.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.806
We'll, uh, we'll do it later.

14:37.711 --> 14:38.877
JUDGE:
<i>It is my understanding</i>

14:38.879 --> 14:40.478
that the two sides

14:40.480 --> 14:41.913
have reached a settlement.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.915
That's correct,
Your Honor.
Hey, a new gavel?

14:43.917 --> 14:46.150
We're good on all terms,
Your Honor.
Uh, no,
we're not, Your Honor.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.919
We're not good
on-on any terms.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.687
What the hell you
talkin' about, Stew?

14:49.689 --> 14:51.155
May I have a moment to
confer with co-counsel?

14:51.157 --> 14:53.558
You mean you need
to talk to your dad?
We got nothing.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.059
That's where you're wrong,
Dad; We got something.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.061
Could we proceed?

14:59.766 --> 15:01.165
You think there's
a shot to take?

15:01.167 --> 15:02.533
Only one way to find out.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.768
While I'm still young.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.169
Your Honor, I have here a record

15:05.171 --> 15:07.005
of six previous occasions
where their client

15:07.007 --> 15:08.172
intentionally drove into

15:08.174 --> 15:10.108
someone's blind spot.
It's a scam.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.110
How'd you find that?
I took the other advice, Dad.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.344
The advice you gave to Dean.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.512
That if you swing to the fences

15:14.514 --> 15:15.580
anything is possible.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.951
¶ ¶

15:19.953 --> 15:22.086
Hey. What are
you guys doing?

15:22.088 --> 15:23.354
Stew, good news.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.089
Todd just hacked
into Malmuth's computer.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.125
Yep. Here it is.
CLAIRE:
You guys know the difference

15:27.127 --> 15:28.793
between hacking
and stealing, right?

15:28.795 --> 15:29.961
I know one of 'em's
way more complicated

15:29.963 --> 15:30.962
than I thought it would be.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.563
Oh, Stew...

15:32.565 --> 15:35.066
I know how you feel about
potential illegal activity,

15:35.068 --> 15:36.968
so perhaps you do not
want to be present.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.136
You know what?
Screw it.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.371
Let's see what
the bastard's hiding.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.773
Wow. Really?

15:41.775 --> 15:42.941
If Ethan wants to be in the play

15:42.943 --> 15:43.942
instead of the crew,
I'm all for it.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.276
Todd, what have we got?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.711
Hang on, I'm looking.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.112
Well, look faster, Todd!

15:48.114 --> 15:49.480
Dean.
No, he's right.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.982
And I need to hear it
in that tone, too.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.083
Wait.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.952
I think I may have
found something.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.386
A folder

15:55.388 --> 15:56.988
marked "auditions."

15:56.990 --> 15:58.323
All right, Todd, listen to me

15:58.325 --> 15:59.624
and listen very carefully.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.992
I want you to highlight
that folder,

16:00.994 --> 16:02.560
double-click it,

16:02.562 --> 16:04.162
and tell me what you see.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.164
TODD:
It looks like...

16:05.165 --> 16:06.998
a bunch of auditions.

16:07.000 --> 16:07.966
Look for Ethan's.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.168
It's missing.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.069
Malmuth.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.570
He deleted it.
Is it possible

16:12.572 --> 16:14.973
to get chills all over
your body at once?

16:14.975 --> 16:16.975
But why would anyone delete
just one audition?

16:16.977 --> 16:18.142
STEWART:
It was too powerful.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.311
We need to take this
to Principal Davis.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.846
And get justice for Ethan.

16:21.848 --> 16:24.515
Todd, your question
about full-body chills?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.317
They<i> are</i> possible.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.592
I still don't understand
how you two stealing

16:34.594 --> 16:36.027
Mr. Malmuth's laptop
proves anything.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.196
Well, it proves you need to beef
up your school security system.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.031
Hey, if you knew the budget
I was working with,

16:40.033 --> 16:41.966
you would not be making cracks
about school security.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.167
Noted.
All we're asking

16:43.169 --> 16:45.670
is that you let Ethan
audition again, for you.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.271
You're an impartial observer.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.873
(scoffs)
This is ridiculous.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.609
Just because I forget
to press record on one audition,

16:51.611 --> 16:53.778
suddenly he's questioning
my integrity?

16:53.780 --> 16:55.880
Hey, Malmuth,
you want to come after me?

16:55.882 --> 16:57.048
I welcome it.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.850
But what I don't welcome

16:58.852 --> 17:00.151
is you bringing my nephew
into this.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.020
Because the only thing
he's guilty of

17:02.022 --> 17:04.055
is following
his little baby heart.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.824
Fine. I've got nothing to hide.

17:06.826 --> 17:09.060
And I'm quite confident
that Principal Davis

17:09.062 --> 17:11.162
will see things the same as me.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.064
Well, we'll just see.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.399
Mm-hmm.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.566
Won't we?

17:15.568 --> 17:16.667
SANDY:
We will.

17:16.669 --> 17:17.835
DEAN:
So let's.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.137
SANDY:
I'm ready.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.071
DEAN:
Bring it.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.507
(crying):
And that man's name...

17:22.509 --> 17:24.075
was Luther.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.077
Well...

17:26.079 --> 17:27.678
Principal Davis,

17:27.680 --> 17:30.515
you want to help Malmuth
get his face off the floor?

17:30.517 --> 17:33.051
Look, it was fine, but I'm
afraid it wasn't good enough

17:33.053 --> 17:34.485
to overrule my teacher.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.887
Are you kidding me?

17:35.889 --> 17:38.022
That was the most amazing
thing I've ever seen!

17:38.024 --> 17:40.058
We see what we want
to see, Mr. Sanderson.

17:40.060 --> 17:43.161
And what I saw was an audition
that... no offense, Ethan...

17:43.163 --> 17:44.595
Was nothing special.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.932
And the impartial observer that
you yourself asked for agrees.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.167
I think we're done here.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.502
Hey, hey.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.072
Don't listen to him, buddy...
You<i> are</i> special.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.634
Let me walk you back to class.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.344
I'll meet up with you.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.716
(quietly): What happened
here was an embarrassment!

18:05.718 --> 18:07.185
Not just to the theater,

18:07.187 --> 18:09.887
not just to the public school
system, not just to...

18:09.889 --> 18:13.124
Is it quicker if you just
say the main thing that it
is an embarrassment to?

18:13.126 --> 18:14.525
Quicker, yes,

18:14.527 --> 18:16.594
but not as a dramatic.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.098
And you've never
understood drama...

18:20.100 --> 18:22.266
have you?

18:23.870 --> 18:26.270
(exhales)

18:26.272 --> 18:28.306
(exhales)
I did not think

18:28.308 --> 18:30.641
I was gonna be able
to keep it together there.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.210
That kid was
something else, huh?

18:32.212 --> 18:33.277
Sublime.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.713
I haven't seen anything
like it since...

18:35.715 --> 18:37.215
well...

18:37.217 --> 18:38.883
his uncle.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.285
Well, that is the last lie
that I tell for you, Malmuth.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.087
I don't care if you
release the pictures.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.922
I never want to feel
this dirty again.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.724
Well, you say that<i> now...</i>

18:46.726 --> 18:49.594
but how will you feel when my
department is short on funds?

18:49.596 --> 18:52.296
In fact, we're already
running low on glow tape.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.464
What are you doing
with that stuff anyway?

18:53.466 --> 18:54.732
What were<i> you</i> doing

18:54.734 --> 18:57.168
on the pole vault mat
with Mrs. Dunbar?

18:57.170 --> 18:59.237
I'll put in the order.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.339
STEWART:
Aha!

19:01.341 --> 19:03.241
DAVIS: Dear God.
I don't want to know
what happened

19:03.243 --> 19:04.175
on that pole vault mat.
I don't even

19:04.177 --> 19:05.309
want to know
what happened to all

19:05.311 --> 19:07.411
that glow tape...
What I do want to know...

19:07.413 --> 19:08.813
is how you live with yourselves

19:08.815 --> 19:10.515
after what you
just did to my son.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.316
Wh-Where did
you come from?

19:12.318 --> 19:14.285
The wings, Malmuth.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.287
You know what they say

19:15.288 --> 19:18.322
about telling secrets
in the theater.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.957
Always...

19:19.959 --> 19:23.027
check for the Shadow Boys.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.429
Shadow Boys?

19:25.431 --> 19:27.365
Well, it just must be the name

19:27.367 --> 19:29.927
for his, like, backstage
group or whatever.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.807
Guys, it was amazing.
You should've seen it.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.142
I mean, I've walked
quietly before,

19:38.144 --> 19:40.144
but I have never walked
like this. I mean,

19:40.146 --> 19:41.445
they had no idea
I was even there.

19:41.447 --> 19:43.614
No, he just exploded from the
wings like a true Shadow Guy.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.815
Shadow Boy.
Whatever.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.050
It's almost as if
you were training

19:46.052 --> 19:47.218
your whole life
for that one moment.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.152
Right?

19:48.154 --> 19:49.154
Congratulations, honey.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.321
And how about you, Ethan,

19:50.323 --> 19:52.223
did you get
the part?
Oh, Deb,

19:52.225 --> 19:55.026
if he hadn't gotten the part,
we'd still be at the school.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.527
Grinding.
Together.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.963
For justice.
For justice.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.331
Good job.
STEWART: Thank you.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.668
And thanks, Dad. You almost
made stage crew look cool.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.204
Aw.
Yeah, almost.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.238
I'm proud of you.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.073
DEAN:
I'm proud of you, too, Stew.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.641
Thanks, guys.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.411
Whatever I said to you
when you were a kid...

20:13.413 --> 20:15.413
I'm sorry.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.316
I appreciate that, Dad.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.685
Sometimes you don't think
about... (sighs)

20:20.687 --> 20:24.255
how those things can affect
your kids in the long run.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.389
Hm.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.033
(quietly):
Put your arm around him.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.702
Again with the arm thing?
He's hurting.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.270
It's like that's all we do now.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.552
He needs you.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.083
Thanks, Dean.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.452
Uh, Dean?
It's my arm, Dad.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.454
Shh, shh, shh.
I-I'm doing it.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.256
Shh. This isn't
about recognition,

20:58.258 --> 21:00.818
not for a true Shadow Boy.
