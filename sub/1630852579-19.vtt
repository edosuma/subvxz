WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.167
NARRATOR:
A mystical Jewish tradition

00:03.250 --> 00:05.208
that speaks
of underground realms

00:05.375 --> 00:08.000
inhabited by strange creatures.

00:08.125 --> 00:09.833
RABBI ARIEL BAR TZADOK:
It is believed and taught

00:09.958 --> 00:11.500
that we are not alone

00:11.583 --> 00:15.125
as intelligent beings
upon our own Earth.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.667
NARRATOR:
A Buddhist legend

00:17.750 --> 00:20.000
that tells
of a lost civilization

00:20.167 --> 00:23.250
surviving in vast
underground canyons.

00:23.375 --> 00:25.792
DAVID CHILDRESS:
Shambhala is
a secret city underground.

00:25.917 --> 00:28.000
It's ruled by kings

00:28.125 --> 00:30.125
who live for hundreds of years.

00:30.250 --> 00:32.042
NARRATOR:
Modern accounts

00:32.167 --> 00:34.500
of humanlike entities
beneath the earth.

00:34.625 --> 00:37.833
WILLIAM HENRY:
Local residents described seeing

00:37.958 --> 00:40.583
reptilian-type humanoid beings

00:40.708 --> 00:42.500
deep inside this cave.

00:42.625 --> 00:46.333
NARRATOR:
Could it be that other
intelligent beings exist

00:46.458 --> 00:49.833
right here on our own planet?

00:49.958 --> 00:52.833
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
Someone may be here

00:53.000 --> 00:55.333
underneath the surface
of the Earth.

00:55.417 --> 00:57.583
And what if these entities
have been here

00:57.708 --> 00:59.125
for thousands of years?

01:01.292 --> 01:03.625
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:03.708 --> 01:06.333
in the universe.

01:06.458 --> 01:09.500
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:10.958 --> 01:13.083
It demands
we question everything

01:13.208 --> 01:15.333
we have ever been taught.

01:15.417 --> 01:19.792
The evidence is all around us.

01:19.917 --> 01:23.083
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.875
We are not alone.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.458
We have never been alone.

01:41.708 --> 01:45.125
NARRATOR:
This historic mountain village
in Upper Galilee is home

01:45.250 --> 01:48.833
to a sacred cave that is the
second most visited Jewish site

01:49.000 --> 01:51.417
in the world
after the Western Wall,

01:51.542 --> 01:54.667
with as many
as two million annual visitors.

01:54.792 --> 01:57.542
According to Hebrew tradition,

01:57.708 --> 02:01.000
this cave served as the home
of the famous rabbi

02:01.125 --> 02:04.833
Shimon Bar Yochai
in the second century AD

02:05.000 --> 02:08.750
when Jerusalem was under
the rule of the Roman empire.

02:09.792 --> 02:11.792
HENRY:
Rabbi Shimon Yochai

02:11.917 --> 02:13.833
lived during a very difficult
time for the Jewish people

02:13.958 --> 02:16.625
living in the kingdom
of-of Israel.

02:17.958 --> 02:22.542
The Emperor Hadrian had been
violently persecuting the Jews.

02:22.667 --> 02:26.167
They forbade them
from studying the Torah.

02:26.333 --> 02:29.000
They forbade them, under penalty
of death, from even

02:29.167 --> 02:32.208
initiating new students
in the Torah.

02:33.917 --> 02:37.833
TZADOK:
Shimon Bar Yochai was one

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
who spoke out
against the empire.

02:41.167 --> 02:44.292
This caused the Romans
to brand him a criminal

02:44.375 --> 02:46.208
and to hunt him to death.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.833
HENRY:
Rabbi Yochai fled
to Northern Israel

02:49.958 --> 02:52.250
into the Galilee where he hid

02:52.375 --> 02:55.000
in a cave
for as long as 13 years.

02:55.167 --> 02:57.708
TZADOK:
When he was concealed
in the cave,

02:57.875 --> 03:01.167
he received a tremendous amount

03:01.292 --> 03:04.333
of profound, sacred wisdom,

03:04.417 --> 03:08.917
secrets that were revealed
to him in the cave

03:09.042 --> 03:13.167
by none less than the immortal
prophet himself, Elijah.

03:13.292 --> 03:16.833
NARRATOR:
If Rabbi Bar Yochai
truly encountered

03:16.958 --> 03:20.833
the prophet Elijah as he
claimed, it would be a miracle,

03:20.958 --> 03:26.417
because Elijah lived in Judea
almost a thousand years earlier.

03:26.542 --> 03:29.000
DANIEL MATT:
According
to Jewish tradition, Elijah

03:29.125 --> 03:30.500
never died.

03:30.583 --> 03:32.875
So he appears
and he enlightens people,

03:33.042 --> 03:34.625
he helps people
who are in trouble.

03:35.542 --> 03:37.708
TZADOK:
So, Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai

03:37.875 --> 03:40.250
communed with Elijah.

03:40.375 --> 03:42.500
He received secrets

03:42.583 --> 03:43.667
of the universe.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.667
NARRATOR:
Rabbi Bar Yochai
understood the teachings

03:46.750 --> 03:49.417
he received
from this immortal messenger

03:49.542 --> 03:52.083
to be of great importance

03:52.208 --> 03:54.667
but also felt
that they should only be shared

03:54.833 --> 03:58.292
with a trusted few and not
yet revealed to the public.

03:58.417 --> 04:00.167
TZADOK:
After he

04:00.333 --> 04:02.000
came out of the cave,

04:02.083 --> 04:05.167
after the Romans
forgot about him,

04:05.250 --> 04:08.083
he gathered together
his students

04:08.208 --> 04:11.125
and taught them the secrets

04:11.250 --> 04:14.458
that were revealed to him
in the cave.

04:15.542 --> 04:17.750
HENRY:
This knowledge was then
written down

04:17.875 --> 04:19.667
or transmitted orally

04:19.792 --> 04:21.750
for centuries
for a thousand years

04:21.875 --> 04:24.000
until a Spanish rabbi

04:24.125 --> 04:28.708
acquired this knowledge that
he then shared with humankind.

04:29.542 --> 04:32.542
NARRATOR:
In the late 13th century,

04:32.667 --> 04:35.500
the secret writings
of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai

04:35.667 --> 04:38.417
were finally published
as the <i>Zohar--</i>

04:38.542 --> 04:42.125
a text
that is still held as sacred

04:42.208 --> 04:45.333
by millions of people
around the world.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.458
It is considered fundamental

04:47.583 --> 04:50.500
to the Jewish tradition
of kabbalah.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.792
MATT:
People often confuse kabbalah

04:53.875 --> 04:55.292
and <i>Zohar.</i>

04:55.375 --> 04:57.500
There's no book
called the <i>Kabbalah.</i>

04:57.625 --> 05:00.333
The <i>Zohar</i> is the major text
of the kabbalah.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.667
So if someone says
they're studying kabbalah,

05:02.792 --> 05:04.958
they probably mean that
they're studying the <i>Zohar.</i>

05:05.042 --> 05:08.667
NARRATOR:
According to practitioners
of kabbalah,

05:08.792 --> 05:11.375
the teachings
include ancient knowledge

05:11.542 --> 05:13.583
that was far ahead of its time,

05:13.708 --> 05:17.500
such as information related
to modern atomic theory,

05:17.625 --> 05:20.417
the spherical shape
of the Earth,

05:20.542 --> 05:24.000
and the existence
of other solar systems.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.333
But of all the teachings
of kabbalah,

05:26.500 --> 05:30.042
many believe the most profound
comes from a passage found

05:30.208 --> 05:35.333
in the <i>Zohar--</i> one that says
there are seven earths.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.958
TSOUKALOS:
Kabbalistic texts teach
that there are

05:38.042 --> 05:40.000
multiple worlds out there.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.208
In fact, there are seven earths.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.500
And they give the name
of each of them,

05:44.583 --> 05:47.500
and when I hear that
then I wonder,

05:47.667 --> 05:51.667
well, could it be possible
that what we have here

05:51.833 --> 05:56.333
is a reference that there are
six other inhabited planets

05:56.458 --> 05:58.417
in the rest of our galaxy?

05:58.542 --> 06:00.125
CHILDRESS:
When you look at these

06:00.208 --> 06:02.125
kabbalistic texts,
and they're talking

06:02.208 --> 06:04.500
about there being
six other earths

06:04.583 --> 06:06.792
besides the one that we're on,

06:06.875 --> 06:10.083
and they're not just
some allegory, uh,

06:10.208 --> 06:11.833
or talking about, you know,

06:11.917 --> 06:13.583
seven continents
or something like that,

06:13.708 --> 06:16.083
well, you have to ask yourself,

06:16.208 --> 06:20.417
is it possible that
these are actual other planets

06:20.542 --> 06:22.833
and they're inhabited?

06:23.708 --> 06:26.292
NARRATOR:
While seven earths may sound

06:26.375 --> 06:28.500
like a reference
to seven planets,

06:28.667 --> 06:31.125
according to those
who study kabbalah,

06:31.250 --> 06:35.583
this concept has another,
even more profound meaning.

06:36.542 --> 06:39.125
Many people have this idea

06:39.250 --> 06:42.917
that the concept of seven earths

06:43.042 --> 06:46.250
has something to do
with some other place.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.833
It's not some other place,
and in fact,

06:48.917 --> 06:52.958
according to Zoharic literature,
it's inside the earth.

06:53.083 --> 06:56.500
There are seven lands,
one above the other.

06:56.583 --> 07:00.000
One of the lands is
actually the Outer Earth,

07:00.125 --> 07:03.208
which is the one
that we're walking on right now.

07:03.333 --> 07:06.583
According to <i>Zohar</i> as well as
Jewish religious interpretation,

07:06.708 --> 07:10.000
the six other earths
are physical locations

07:10.167 --> 07:13.333
that are subterranean
to our present reality.

07:13.458 --> 07:17.333
Even more compelling is
that it also teaches

07:17.500 --> 07:20.958
that each of the six
other earths are inhabited

07:21.042 --> 07:22.667
by intelligent creatures.

07:22.750 --> 07:25.167
There could be
this multiplicity of beings.

07:25.292 --> 07:27.333
They exist in other realms

07:27.500 --> 07:30.792
but are always kept hidden
in the Inner Earth.

07:33.542 --> 07:36.000
TZADOK:
One of the profound teachings

07:36.083 --> 07:39.167
of the oral Torah tradition

07:39.250 --> 07:41.292
is that we human beings

07:41.417 --> 07:45.500
are not the only
intelligent species

07:45.667 --> 07:48.500
indigenous to our Earth.

07:49.542 --> 07:54.708
And within this Earth live
other types of entities.

07:54.833 --> 07:59.500
TSOUKALOS:
Of course, the notion
of a hollow Earth is absurd.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.750
The Earth is not hollow.

08:01.875 --> 08:05.750
However, if you change
the word "hollow" to "inner,"

08:05.875 --> 08:09.417
then I even have to say
there could be an argument made

08:09.542 --> 08:13.375
that someone may be here

08:13.542 --> 08:16.708
underneath the surface
of the Earth.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.833
Because it is a geological fact

08:19.958 --> 08:24.667
that there are gigantic chambers
underneath the Earth's crust,

08:24.792 --> 08:27.625
some of which
even contain water

08:27.750 --> 08:31.167
that are larger
than the world's oceans.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.000
So, you know,
you have to wonder

08:33.125 --> 08:38.500
if it's at all possible
that somebody is down there.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.125
And what if these entities
have been here

08:40.208 --> 08:42.000
for thousands of years?

08:42.958 --> 08:44.833
NARRATOR:
Is it possible
that Earth is home

08:44.917 --> 08:49.042
to other intelligent beings that
exist deep beneath the surface?

08:49.208 --> 08:53.500
And if so, how long have
they been on this planet?

08:53.667 --> 08:56.125
According to the teachings
of kabbalah,

08:56.250 --> 09:00.500
some of the beings of Inner
Earth once lived on the surface

09:00.667 --> 09:04.125
long before the time of humans.

09:07.875 --> 09:09.875
NARRATOR:
In the Hebrew Bible's

09:10.042 --> 09:13.500
Book of Ecclesiastes
is the well-known saying,

09:13.667 --> 09:16.833
"There's nothing new
under the sun."

09:16.917 --> 09:20.208
But according
to practitioners of kabbalah,

09:20.333 --> 09:22.458
this seemingly
philosophical verse,

09:22.542 --> 09:24.833
which continues with the phrase

09:24.958 --> 09:27.500
"No one remembers
the former generations,"

09:27.625 --> 09:30.708
also has a very literal meaning.

09:31.958 --> 09:36.083
The kabbalah teaches that
there were pre-Adamic races.

09:36.208 --> 09:39.500
In the Book of Genesis,
Adam is the first man.

09:39.583 --> 09:41.458
So, what the kabbalah
is saying is that,

09:41.583 --> 09:45.333
before Adam, there were
other races of beings

09:45.458 --> 09:47.208
and previous civilizations.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.542
TZADOK:
It is believed and taught

09:50.667 --> 09:53.375
that we have had civilization
upon our Earth

09:53.500 --> 09:57.500
for tens of thousands of years,

09:57.625 --> 10:00.667
possibly much longer,

10:00.792 --> 10:05.500
prior to Adam spoken of
in the Bible.

10:05.667 --> 10:08.750
NARRATOR:
According
to the kabbalah teachings,

10:08.875 --> 10:11.667
some of the beings
that inhabit Inner Earth lived

10:11.792 --> 10:14.875
on the surface
long before the time of humans.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.083
And kabbalah is not
the only ancient tradition

10:19.208 --> 10:22.333
that speaks
of prehuman civilizations.

10:22.458 --> 10:26.875
BIRNES:
All across the planet,
there are stories

10:27.000 --> 10:30.500
of a highly technical,
highly sophisticated,

10:30.583 --> 10:33.917
brilliant civilization
that's no longer here.

10:35.708 --> 10:38.125
The story of Lemuria
is the story

10:38.250 --> 10:41.625
of an ancient civilization,
a brilliant civilization

10:41.708 --> 10:43.500
that reached high points,

10:43.583 --> 10:47.125
but dreadful climate
wiped it out.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.167
The story of Atlantis
is the same thing.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.167
It's in the Bible,

10:53.292 --> 10:55.500
as well as Gilgamesh.

10:55.625 --> 10:58.167
HENRY:
This corresponds
with Greek thought

10:58.250 --> 11:00.708
that there were five ages.

11:01.542 --> 11:03.875
The Hindus teach
about the yugas

11:04.000 --> 11:06.917
and the rise and fall
of civilization,

11:07.042 --> 11:09.875
where civilization advances
to a very high place

11:10.000 --> 11:14.167
and then descends
and then reascends.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.333
JONATHAN YOUNG:
In Hinduism, there are cycles

11:17.417 --> 11:19.333
of destruction and rebirth,

11:19.417 --> 11:20.875
and we're in the fourth now.

11:21.042 --> 11:23.917
Three entire stages
have come before now.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.333
In the Hopi Native American
Indigenous teaching,

11:27.500 --> 11:29.458
there are a number of worlds,

11:29.542 --> 11:33.125
and we are
on the fourth reality.

11:34.458 --> 11:38.833
NARRATOR:
If Earth was inhabited
by prehuman civilizations,

11:38.958 --> 11:42.000
could there be physical evidence
of their existence?

11:42.125 --> 11:47.208
Incredibly, scientists have
recently identified anomalies

11:47.333 --> 11:48.917
in Earth's geological record

11:49.042 --> 11:52.167
that could be markers
of an advanced civilization

11:52.292 --> 11:55.208
that existed millions
of years ago.

11:56.167 --> 11:58.500
HENRY:
Today, modern science is looking

11:58.667 --> 12:00.875
into our ancient geological past

12:01.042 --> 12:04.250
in a concept
they call techno signatures.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.625
They're looking
at our civilization and saying

12:06.750 --> 12:09.500
that one day
everything that we see around us

12:09.625 --> 12:12.833
on the Earth
will be reduced to rock.

12:14.125 --> 12:17.625
It'll be a thin layer of rock
in our geological record.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.750
And some future species
will be able to look back

12:19.875 --> 12:22.417
and see that we were
a technological civilization

12:22.542 --> 12:24.750
because we have left residue.

12:24.875 --> 12:28.083
We have left
chlorofluorocarbons.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.292
And what they're doing now
is looking back

12:30.375 --> 12:32.375
into the geological record.

12:32.500 --> 12:36.833
They have actually found a seam
or a line of rock

12:36.958 --> 12:42.000
that's 56 million years old
that reveals that at that time

12:42.125 --> 12:43.667
there was more carbon
in the sediment

12:43.792 --> 12:45.833
than is supposed to be there,
and suddenly

12:45.958 --> 12:48.375
there is an ecological collapse.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.167
How do you explain this,

12:50.333 --> 12:52.167
other than
there must have been some kind

12:52.250 --> 12:55.667
of a nonhuman civilization
that caused this?

12:55.792 --> 12:57.125
The evidence is there.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.750
NARRATOR:
Some archaeologists
and geologists also point

13:02.875 --> 13:06.583
to the discovery
of extremely ancient artifacts

13:06.708 --> 13:09.167
as further evidence
that civilizations

13:09.250 --> 13:12.333
existed on Earth
long before humans.

13:13.333 --> 13:17.125
One such artifact is an object
called the London Hammer

13:17.208 --> 13:21.417
that was discovered
in Texas in 1936.

13:22.375 --> 13:25.000
It was a prehistoric hammer,
if you will,

13:25.167 --> 13:27.667
with part of the handle
still in place,

13:27.792 --> 13:32.042
inside some very old rock.

13:32.208 --> 13:36.500
The hammer itself was found
in the Travis formation.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.333
It's a concretion
of sandstone.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.583
And it usually takes
about 140 million years

13:41.708 --> 13:43.417
for this to form.

13:43.542 --> 13:47.917
That would put the hammer
at 140 million years old.

13:48.042 --> 13:49.875
Where did it come from?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.667
Who was here
140 million years ago?

13:52.792 --> 13:54.917
There's been many fossils
and artifacts

13:55.042 --> 13:58.458
that have been found
that defies our timeline.

13:58.583 --> 14:03.125
Some of them have been found
in Antelope Valley, in Utah,

14:03.208 --> 14:06.250
which was a shoe print,
which was 200 million years old.

14:06.375 --> 14:10.167
We're constantly finding
new relics, new pieces,

14:10.292 --> 14:13.833
new evidence that suggests
there's probably civilizations

14:13.958 --> 14:17.375
that were here
long before we have been here.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.292
If we are essentially due
to a cataclysm,

14:20.375 --> 14:23.833
whether this is the tilting
of the Earth's axis,

14:23.958 --> 14:27.000
or if it's through a solar flare
or something like this,

14:27.083 --> 14:29.958
or-or even a war or something

14:30.042 --> 14:31.708
that there's
virtually nobody left,

14:31.833 --> 14:34.083
after three or four generations,

14:34.208 --> 14:38.250
nobody will remember what
was here a hundred years ago.

14:39.875 --> 14:44.125
It's quite possible
that something like us

14:44.208 --> 14:50.125
already existed
and there's nothing left.

14:51.208 --> 14:52.833
BIRNES:
So, history,

14:52.958 --> 14:56.500
archaeology themselves point

14:56.583 --> 15:00.333
to life-forms on this planet
long before human beings.

15:00.417 --> 15:03.708
The question is,
where are they from?

15:03.833 --> 15:06.167
I believe we've been visited

15:06.250 --> 15:08.792
by lots
of extraterrestrial races.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.500
Some took, some didn't.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.417
Some stayed, some left.

15:13.542 --> 15:17.333
Some are on land,
some are underwater.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.208
We're a colony.

15:19.333 --> 15:22.500
NARRATOR:
Could it be
that long before the time

15:22.583 --> 15:26.042
of modern humans,
other intelligent species--

15:26.167 --> 15:30.042
possibly even from other
planets-- populated the Earth?

15:30.167 --> 15:34.083
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

15:34.208 --> 15:36.333
and point to the teachings
of kabbalah

15:36.458 --> 15:38.583
for evidence
that some of these species

15:38.708 --> 15:42.417
that predated humans
also coexisted with them.

15:43.625 --> 15:47.375
One example can be found
in the Bible's Book of Genesis

15:47.500 --> 15:50.292
and the creature described
in the Garden of Eden

15:50.417 --> 15:52.292
as the serpent.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.500
TZADOK:
The serpent not only spoke

15:55.667 --> 15:57.417
but stood erect,

15:57.542 --> 16:00.792
had arms and legs

16:00.875 --> 16:02.917
and, clearly, intelligence.

16:03.042 --> 16:04.917
We're describing

16:05.042 --> 16:07.042
a pre-Adamic,

16:07.167 --> 16:11.042
Earth-based reptilian.

16:12.875 --> 16:17.250
And this we find echoed
in legends

16:17.375 --> 16:21.292
and teachings from cultures
around the world.

16:21.417 --> 16:25.333
So, one of the great
pre-Adamic civilizations

16:25.458 --> 16:29.375
clearly was
a reptilian humanoid.

16:29.500 --> 16:33.500
And these are referred to
as seraphim.

16:34.542 --> 16:37.500
NARRATOR:
If a prehuman race
is represented

16:37.625 --> 16:39.167
in the Garden of Eden,

16:39.292 --> 16:42.708
does that mean that it continued
to inhabit the Earth

16:42.833 --> 16:46.083
after the time
of the first humans?

16:47.042 --> 16:49.000
BIRNES:
It could well be

16:49.125 --> 16:52.792
that there was a whole
evolving race of reptilians--

16:52.875 --> 16:55.542
call them seraphim, call them
anything you want to--

16:55.667 --> 16:59.333
that basically were,
in their own way,

16:59.417 --> 17:03.292
civilizing this planet,
organizing life on this planet.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.833
And then human beings came
to this planet,

17:05.917 --> 17:07.792
and they realized
we couldn't live together

17:07.917 --> 17:10.083
and they went underground.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.708
NARRATOR:
Could ancient stories
of other intelligent species

17:14.833 --> 17:17.333
sharing the planet with humans

17:17.417 --> 17:21.417
and then migrating
to subterranean realms be true?

17:22.583 --> 17:25.625
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

17:25.750 --> 17:27.708
the evidence can be found

17:27.833 --> 17:29.542
in numerous ancient traditions

17:29.708 --> 17:33.250
that describe
not only underground worlds

17:33.375 --> 17:36.292
but also the many strange beings

17:36.375 --> 17:39.167
that reside within them.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.333
NARRATOR:
For centuries,

17:45.458 --> 17:48.250
the Jewish mystical text
called the <i>Zohar</i>

17:48.375 --> 17:52.208
has been a source of sacred
teachings and esoteric wisdom.

17:53.250 --> 17:56.333
But the idea
that there are inhabited realms

17:56.417 --> 18:00.458
within the earth is not
exclusive to the <i>Zohar</i> alone.

18:01.542 --> 18:04.583
This concept can also be found
in ancient texts

18:04.708 --> 18:06.958
from numerous cultures
around the world,

18:07.042 --> 18:11.083
like the <i>Vishnu Purana</i> of India.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.417
Written roughly 2,000 years ago,

18:13.542 --> 18:16.708
the <i>Vishnu Purana</i> describes
multiple domains

18:16.833 --> 18:18.958
that exist deep underground.

18:19.875 --> 18:23.875
HENRY:
In India, we learn
of a place called Patala,

18:24.042 --> 18:26.292
which is beneath
the surface of the Earth.

18:26.375 --> 18:29.292
And Patala has many subterranean
realms that are believed

18:29.375 --> 18:32.333
to be inhabited
by intelligent creatures.

18:32.417 --> 18:35.500
In fact,
myth and folklore are filled

18:35.625 --> 18:38.000
with stories
of Inner Earth civilizations,

18:38.167 --> 18:40.042
the same as the <i>Zohar.</i>

18:40.167 --> 18:43.167
The Greeks believed
the same thing.

18:43.292 --> 18:45.833
CHILDRESS:
This is very similar
to the story

18:46.000 --> 18:47.333
of the Tuatha Dé Danann.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.000
And ancient Irish texts talk

18:50.083 --> 18:52.500
about the Tuatha Dé Danann as

18:52.625 --> 18:55.667
arriving in shadowy airships,

18:55.750 --> 18:59.667
coming from the sky,
they're enveloped in mist.

18:59.750 --> 19:03.708
They had all kinds
of tremendous technology.

19:03.833 --> 19:07.500
And they were the rulers,
allegedly, of Ireland

19:07.625 --> 19:13.000
for quite a long time until
modern Irish came to Ireland,

19:13.083 --> 19:16.250
and they made a pact

19:16.375 --> 19:19.333
with the Tuatha Dé Danann.

19:19.417 --> 19:22.167
The Tuatha Dé Danann,
according to the legend,

19:22.292 --> 19:24.417
go underground in Ireland,

19:24.542 --> 19:26.833
and now are living
in the underground world.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.417
AMIR HUSSAIN:
You've got, you know,
the similar kind of story

19:29.542 --> 19:31.375
with the Sumerian texts.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.917
The Anunnaki literally
are the sky gods.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.875
But then, as you get into
later versions of the stories,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.333
one of them, Inanna,
goes into the netherworld.

19:39.458 --> 19:42.500
And so, you have these gods
that start up in the sky

19:42.667 --> 19:46.125
but then come down not just
to Earth but into the earth.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.625
And you see this
across different cultures.

19:50.542 --> 19:53.000
NARRATOR:
Many ancient cultures taught

19:53.125 --> 19:55.625
that beings living
inside the earth are not

19:55.708 --> 19:58.583
of the same physical nature
as humans

19:58.708 --> 20:01.917
but have the ability
to effortlessly travel

20:02.042 --> 20:04.000
between our realm and theirs.

20:04.917 --> 20:07.500
YOUNG:
In Islamic culture,

20:07.667 --> 20:09.917
there is the idea of the djinn,

20:10.042 --> 20:12.083
from which we get
our word "genie,"

20:12.208 --> 20:14.500
and this was not
an angelic presence.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.750
It had a category of its own.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.333
It wasn't human,
it wasn't exactly godlike.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.250
It was in between.

20:21.375 --> 20:24.375
It could travel from this world
to another and back.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.958
And sometimes
they cause trouble.

20:27.042 --> 20:29.250
Sometimes they help people.

20:30.292 --> 20:32.833
TZADOK:
It is known
that they are indigenous

20:32.958 --> 20:35.375
to the domains of Inner Earth.

20:35.500 --> 20:39.042
And these djinn are said
to have bodies

20:39.167 --> 20:43.667
only of fire and air.

20:44.667 --> 20:47.292
And we might think,
"Well, they're all spiritual,"

20:47.375 --> 20:50.083
but our traditions teach
that's not so.

20:51.125 --> 20:56.375
Like human beings, it is said
they eat and they drink,

20:56.500 --> 20:58.625
they sexually procreate,

20:58.708 --> 21:00.875
and they die.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.875
And yet they can be invisible.

21:06.417 --> 21:08.333
NARRATOR:
While many traditions talk

21:08.417 --> 21:11.500
of humanlike beings inhabiting
Earth's inner realms,

21:11.625 --> 21:14.750
the <i>Zohar</i> teaches
that all kinds of entities

21:14.875 --> 21:18.333
reside below the surface.

21:18.458 --> 21:21.792
And some are even hybrids
of different creatures.

21:23.875 --> 21:27.000
TZADOK:
The <i>Zohar</i> tells us
that there are hybrid beings

21:27.125 --> 21:29.375
who live there.

21:29.542 --> 21:33.000
Some of whom are half human,
half animal.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.708
There are beings

21:35.833 --> 21:38.667
that have the bodies
of human beings

21:38.750 --> 21:41.708
with the heads of lions
or the heads of bulls.

21:41.833 --> 21:45.375
And this sounds
very familiar to us

21:45.542 --> 21:48.167
from ancient mythologies
and legends.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.208
NARRATOR:
The hybrid beings

21:50.333 --> 21:52.500
that the <i>Zohar</i> describes
as having descended

21:52.625 --> 21:54.875
to Inner Earth also appear

21:55.000 --> 21:56.833
in other ancient traditions

21:56.958 --> 22:00.667
as creatures that once lived
on the surface.

22:00.833 --> 22:02.750
The ancient Egyptians
recorded evidence

22:02.875 --> 22:04.167
of-of hybrid beings,

22:04.292 --> 22:07.083
including Thoth the birdman,

22:07.208 --> 22:09.542
Sekhmet the lion goddess,

22:09.667 --> 22:13.708
as well as Anubis, who's
a humanoid with a canine head.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.333
We have the satyrs
of Greek mythology

22:17.500 --> 22:19.667
that are part human, part goat.

22:20.542 --> 22:24.625
In Sumeria,
we have mermen and mermaids.

22:24.750 --> 22:28.375
We have beings that are
half human and half serpent.

22:29.333 --> 22:32.125
In India,
the most popular God is Ganesh,

22:32.250 --> 22:34.667
who's half human, half elephant.

22:36.875 --> 22:39.167
NARRATOR:
In addition to hybrid beings,

22:39.333 --> 22:41.542
Inner Earth is also said
to be home

22:41.667 --> 22:43.917
to fantastical creatures
that are described

22:44.042 --> 22:46.833
in myths and legends
throughout the world.

22:47.833 --> 22:50.417
TZADOK:
According
to the ancient teachings,

22:50.542 --> 22:55.333
in Inner Earth
there do live real dragons,

22:55.458 --> 22:57.833
spoken of in the Book of Job.

22:58.958 --> 23:04.000
The phoenix, which burns itself
to ashes in its nest

23:04.083 --> 23:05.833
and then resurrects itself

23:05.958 --> 23:08.375
just as the Book of Job teaches,

23:08.500 --> 23:10.833
also live in Inner Earth.

23:11.792 --> 23:16.333
And it is taught
that unicorns, real ones,

23:16.458 --> 23:19.500
are alive today in Inner Earth.

23:20.542 --> 23:22.042
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

23:22.167 --> 23:24.500
that these Inner Earth entities
that come up

23:24.625 --> 23:26.917
in tradition after tradition

23:27.042 --> 23:29.250
were actually witnessed
by our ancestors

23:29.375 --> 23:31.667
thousands of years ago?

23:31.833 --> 23:33.333
TSOUKALOS:
So, all around the world

23:33.500 --> 23:36.000
we have these depictions

23:36.125 --> 23:39.333
in ancient carvings,
in ancient paintings,

23:39.500 --> 23:42.000
figurines, everything.

23:42.083 --> 23:45.792
It doesn't matter
what ancient culture you go to.

23:45.875 --> 23:49.042
We have the same stories
worldwide.

23:49.958 --> 23:52.000
And the further
you go back in time,

23:52.125 --> 23:56.208
the more similar
these stories become.

23:56.375 --> 23:57.875
HENRY:
Ancient cultures

23:58.000 --> 24:00.083
must have experienced
these types of beings,

24:00.208 --> 24:03.833
or why else would humans
have been making depictions

24:03.958 --> 24:07.792
from virtually the beginning
of recorded history?

24:08.958 --> 24:11.542
NARRATOR:
The <i>Zohar</i> and other traditions

24:11.667 --> 24:13.542
that speak of intelligent beings

24:13.667 --> 24:16.750
and fantastical creatures
occupying Inner Earth

24:16.875 --> 24:19.375
were written many centuries ago.

24:19.542 --> 24:23.292
If these stories are more
than mere mythology,

24:23.375 --> 24:26.958
are there still entities
living within the earth today?

24:27.875 --> 24:30.167
Perhaps further clues
can be found

24:30.292 --> 24:32.292
by examining modern-day reports

24:32.375 --> 24:35.208
of encounters
with strange beings

24:35.333 --> 24:38.083
emerging from caves.

24:42.750 --> 24:45.250
NARRATOR:
Quang Binh Province, Vietnam.

24:46.542 --> 24:48.833
1991.

24:48.917 --> 24:52.667
Logger Ho Khanh discovers
a mysterious entrance

24:52.750 --> 24:54.500
to a hidden mountain cave

24:54.667 --> 24:57.000
obscured
by dense jungle overgrowth.

24:57.083 --> 25:00.833
The cliffs leading down
to the entrance are so steep,

25:00.917 --> 25:04.708
he cannot explore it further,
but he notes its location.

25:04.875 --> 25:07.500
Nearly two decades later,

25:07.667 --> 25:09.875
the British Cave
Research Association

25:10.042 --> 25:12.042
finally explores the cave.

25:12.167 --> 25:14.792
What the team discovers
is astounding.

25:14.875 --> 25:18.167
It is the largest
underground chamber

25:18.333 --> 25:20.458
on the planet.

25:20.542 --> 25:23.333
It's not just a cave.

25:23.417 --> 25:25.875
It's an actual world in Vietnam.

25:27.208 --> 25:31.292
Inside this cave,
it's 40 stories high.

25:32.208 --> 25:34.625
There's actually
an ancient forest.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.708
It's got flowing water.

25:36.875 --> 25:40.917
Not just a puddle or a stream
but an actual river.

25:42.292 --> 25:47.875
Inside the cave is
an entire growing ecosystem.

25:48.042 --> 25:50.625
And it's so deep that
it looks like it's an entrance

25:50.750 --> 25:53.042
to a whole other reality.

25:55.167 --> 25:57.375
NARRATOR:
This incredible
subterranean realm,

25:57.542 --> 25:59.292
called the Son Doong Cave,

25:59.417 --> 26:03.000
is estimated to be roughly
three million years old.

26:03.125 --> 26:06.792
It runs through the earth
for nearly six miles,

26:06.875 --> 26:09.833
and numerous areas where
the cave ceiling has collapsed

26:09.958 --> 26:12.500
allow sunlight to enter,
resulting in the growth

26:12.625 --> 26:15.208
of trees and other vegetation.

26:16.750 --> 26:19.708
But according to area residents,

26:19.875 --> 26:22.083
what's most notable
about Son Doong Cave

26:22.208 --> 26:25.792
are the strange creatures that
are believed to dwell within it.

26:26.708 --> 26:29.625
HENRY:
Local residents described seeing

26:29.708 --> 26:32.625
reptilian-type
humanoid beings emerging

26:32.708 --> 26:34.250
from the Son Doong Cave.

26:34.375 --> 26:36.208
And they believe
that they actually live

26:36.333 --> 26:38.500
deep inside this cave.

26:38.625 --> 26:40.875
What's fascinating about this is

26:41.000 --> 26:43.458
that these reptilian-type
humanoid beings

26:43.542 --> 26:46.042
are similar to the seraphim,

26:46.167 --> 26:49.000
or the winged serpents
in kabbalistic tradition.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.500
The seraphim are said
to have gone and lived

26:51.583 --> 26:54.708
in the Inner Earth, according
to kabbalistic teaching.

26:55.958 --> 26:58.000
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that reports

26:58.125 --> 26:59.958
of reptilians at Son Doong Cave

27:00.042 --> 27:03.375
are encounters with beings
from Inner Earth?

27:05.375 --> 27:07.333
While it may sound
too incredible to be true,

27:07.458 --> 27:10.583
there have been reports
that during the Vietnam War

27:10.708 --> 27:14.792
in the 1970s,
U.S. soldiers encountered

27:14.875 --> 27:18.958
what they described as "upright
lizards" inhabiting caves.

27:20.292 --> 27:24.167
And accounts of reptilian beings
existing in underground caverns

27:24.292 --> 27:27.792
can be found
all across the globe,

27:27.875 --> 27:32.458
even on the other side
of the world in Cuzco, Peru.

27:32.542 --> 27:34.667
CHILDRESS:
Throughout Peru and

27:34.750 --> 27:36.708
around Cuzco, particularly,

27:36.875 --> 27:40.667
there are many, many stories
of a tunnel system

27:40.792 --> 27:45.333
that has something to do
with serpent deities,

27:45.458 --> 27:47.958
which they call the Amaru there.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.833
The Peruvian authorities
themselves decided

27:50.917 --> 27:54.333
it was too dangerous for people
to go into these tunnels.

27:54.417 --> 27:57.667
So, they looked for all
of the entrances they could

27:57.792 --> 28:00.500
around Cuzco,
and they sealed them up.

28:01.417 --> 28:05.167
And this is a well-known story
within Peruvian history.

28:06.125 --> 28:08.000
NARRATOR:
While there have been
many reports

28:08.083 --> 28:11.458
from around the world
of humanlike reptilians,

28:11.583 --> 28:14.875
there is another Inner Earth
entity described in the <i>Zohar</i>

28:15.042 --> 28:19.333
that is even more commonly
witnessed in modern times.

28:19.417 --> 28:21.167
SALOFF:
According to Zoharic literature,

28:21.292 --> 28:23.750
there are beings
inside the earth

28:23.875 --> 28:25.958
having large black eyes

28:26.042 --> 28:30.875
and a nose that is only
two darks holes on the face.

28:31.042 --> 28:34.042
Now, that corresponds to things
that we've seen about,

28:34.208 --> 28:38.583
heard about these, uh,
for lack of a better word, ETs.

28:39.542 --> 28:42.833
There is a lot of evidence
that these beings

28:42.917 --> 28:45.292
that we think are coming
from another planet

28:45.375 --> 28:47.000
are not coming
from another planet.

28:47.167 --> 28:49.833
They're coming
from inside our own Earth.

28:50.708 --> 28:52.792
NARRATOR:
The black-eyed entities,

28:52.875 --> 28:55.292
commonly referred to
as Greys by ufologists,

28:55.375 --> 28:58.042
are the beings
most often reported

28:58.167 --> 29:00.667
by alleged alien abductees,

29:00.792 --> 29:02.792
many of whom claim

29:02.875 --> 29:06.458
to have been taken aboard
saucer-shaped craft.

29:06.583 --> 29:09.750
Could it be that
the so-called flying saucers

29:09.875 --> 29:12.833
so often reported
in modern times

29:12.917 --> 29:16.500
are not coming from outer space
but Inner Earth?

29:18.125 --> 29:21.000
According to some
ancient astronaut theorists,

29:21.125 --> 29:24.875
this notion is supported
by numerous accounts of UFOs

29:25.000 --> 29:28.167
that are seen disappearing
into the landscape

29:28.250 --> 29:32.625
and sometimes even flying
directly into mountains.

29:32.708 --> 29:37.167
In fact, one of the first
UFO sightings on record involves

29:37.250 --> 29:39.625
an entire squadron of vehicles

29:39.708 --> 29:42.292
that appeared
to enter a volcano.

29:43.417 --> 29:46.667
One of the first modern
UFO sightings was recorded

29:46.792 --> 29:49.500
in June of 1947
by Kenneth Arnold.

29:49.583 --> 29:54.458
He was flying his private plane
near Mount Rainier in Washington

29:54.542 --> 29:58.000
when he catches sight
of some flashes of light.

29:58.083 --> 30:00.083
And soon he discovers
that this is actually

30:00.208 --> 30:04.083
a squadron of what he described
as flying saucers

30:04.208 --> 30:05.917
skipping across the sky.

30:06.042 --> 30:08.125
He follows them

30:08.208 --> 30:10.333
as they disappear
into the direction

30:10.458 --> 30:13.458
of nearby Mount Adams,
a volcano,

30:13.542 --> 30:17.292
which is the sight
of many modern UFO sightings.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.542
Is it possible
that Mount Rainier

30:19.708 --> 30:23.625
and Mount Adams are perhaps
entranceways utilized

30:23.708 --> 30:26.917
by these craft
into other realms?

30:27.042 --> 30:30.250
If these craft did enter
into Mount Rainier

30:30.375 --> 30:35.000
and/or Mount Adams, it would
not seem unusual to UFO experts.

30:35.125 --> 30:38.500
Mountains around the world,
like Bugarach in Southern France

30:38.625 --> 30:42.000
and Musinè in Northern Italy,
are often sites

30:42.125 --> 30:46.333
where UFOs are reported actually
entering into the mountains.

30:47.625 --> 30:51.292
NARRATOR:
Mountains are often cited
in ancient traditions

30:51.375 --> 30:54.042
as entrances
to Inner Earth realms.

30:55.042 --> 30:58.958
The most well-known is
the legendary land of Shambhala

30:59.042 --> 31:00.750
that Buddhists
and Hindus identify

31:00.875 --> 31:03.625
as the home of the gods.

31:03.750 --> 31:07.167
Many believe that the entrance
to this subterranean realm

31:07.333 --> 31:11.458
exists among the ruins
of the lost Kingdom of Gu-ge

31:11.542 --> 31:14.583
on top of Mount Kailash
in Tibet.

31:14.708 --> 31:18.583
CHILDRESS:
Shambhala is said
to be underground.

31:18.708 --> 31:22.542
It's ruled by kings
who live for hundreds of years.

31:22.708 --> 31:25.750
They have wonderful technology.

31:25.875 --> 31:28.625
There's electricity,
there's airships.

31:28.708 --> 31:31.292
And also, part of the tradition
of Shambhala is

31:31.417 --> 31:33.500
that they are guiding mankind.

31:33.583 --> 31:37.417
Very much as we often think that
extraterrestrials are doing.

31:37.542 --> 31:41.542
A number of people have
suggested that Shambhala,

31:41.667 --> 31:45.500
the hidden city, is
at Mount Kailash or very nearby.

31:45.625 --> 31:51.167
Gu-ge, right near Mount Kailash,
is a very strange fortress

31:51.292 --> 31:55.208
built on the top
of a pyramidal mountain.

31:55.375 --> 31:59.667
And the fortress of Gu-ge had
all kinds of tunnels

31:59.792 --> 32:01.667
and hidden staircases

32:01.750 --> 32:05.208
that went underground
and went inside this mountain.

32:05.333 --> 32:08.458
So, when archaeologists went
there, they were astounded

32:08.542 --> 32:14.167
that this city of Gu-ge
apparently led inside the earth.

32:14.292 --> 32:16.167
What people seemed
to believe was that

32:16.250 --> 32:18.333
if you were to follow
these tunnels far enough

32:18.458 --> 32:21.208
into the earth,
you would eventually come

32:21.333 --> 32:24.417
to that hidden city
of Shambhala,

32:24.542 --> 32:28.292
an active city
full of light and-and power.

32:29.583 --> 32:31.625
NARRATOR:
While there have been
numerous reports

32:31.750 --> 32:33.792
of UFOs at Mount Kailash,

32:33.917 --> 32:36.333
explorers have yet to find

32:36.458 --> 32:39.042
the legendary subterranean
realm of Shambhala.

32:41.083 --> 32:43.417
But according
to the secret diary

32:43.542 --> 32:47.500
of one of the United States'
most celebrated naval officers,

32:47.583 --> 32:50.333
a hidden entrance
to Inner Earth can be found

32:50.458 --> 32:52.958
thousands of miles to the south

32:53.083 --> 32:55.167
-in Antarctica.
-(wind whistling)

33:03.333 --> 33:06.167
NARRATOR: Esteemed U.S.
naval officer and explorer

33:06.250 --> 33:09.167
Admiral Richard Byrd,
one of the first pilots

33:09.292 --> 33:11.875
to fly over both
the North and South Poles,

33:12.042 --> 33:14.125
organizes Operation Highjump,

33:14.208 --> 33:18.000
the largest expedition ever
to travel to Antarctica,

33:18.125 --> 33:22.333
with 13 ships, 23 aircraft,

33:22.458 --> 33:26.125
and over 4,700
military personnel.

33:26.208 --> 33:28.542
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
This was very important

33:28.667 --> 33:34.208
that after the conclusion
of World War II,

33:34.333 --> 33:40.167
Admiral Byrd was asked
if he would mount

33:40.292 --> 33:44.458
a large armada
and go for four months.

33:44.583 --> 33:48.167
It was supposed to be
that they would go in December,

33:48.292 --> 33:52.167
January, February and March,
and there was a list

33:52.292 --> 33:56.458
of military goals
that they were to achieve, but

33:56.542 --> 33:58.833
by the end of February,
something happened.

33:59.708 --> 34:02.833
NARRATOR:
One of the mission's
official goals

34:02.917 --> 34:05.958
was investigating sites
for potential military bases

34:06.083 --> 34:07.792
in Antarctica.

34:09.042 --> 34:10.750
But during his explorations,

34:10.875 --> 34:15.208
Admiral Byrd allegedly came upon
something highly unexpected.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.333
YOUNG:
This story

34:17.417 --> 34:19.333
is said to come
from his diaries,

34:19.500 --> 34:21.167
not his published account
of the trip,

34:21.292 --> 34:22.917
but something he held back

34:23.042 --> 34:26.333
and then later was suppressed
by government authorities

34:26.458 --> 34:27.750
that found it frightening.

34:27.875 --> 34:30.333
HENRY:
In his diary,

34:30.458 --> 34:33.583
which was discovered
by his son after his death,

34:33.708 --> 34:36.708
Admiral Byrd tells
an extraordinary story.

34:38.417 --> 34:40.708
BIRNES:
Admiral Byrd heard
there was an entrance

34:40.833 --> 34:42.917
to the center of the Earth
through the South Pole,

34:43.042 --> 34:46.500
and he took planes into the
South... under the South Pole.

34:46.583 --> 34:50.292
And when he did that,
he discovered

34:50.417 --> 34:52.625
that as he flew over the Pole,

34:52.708 --> 34:55.792
suddenly he's looking at things
that shouldn't be there.

34:55.917 --> 34:58.292
I mean, it was temperate.

34:58.417 --> 35:02.292
He and a squadron flew
under the earth, into the earth.

35:02.417 --> 35:05.125
HENRY:
It turns into this lush
and green area,

35:05.250 --> 35:07.000
and he can't even
believe his eyes.

35:07.125 --> 35:09.667
But that's just the beginning
of his extraordinary story.

35:09.833 --> 35:12.000
He tells how, all of a sudden,
he starts

35:12.083 --> 35:17.833
to see a shimmering rainbow
city that's made of crystal.

35:17.917 --> 35:19.833
His airplane is taken control of

35:20.000 --> 35:23.292
when he suddenly sees
these flying disk-shaped objects

35:23.375 --> 35:26.708
around him
that lead him to the ground...

35:28.000 --> 35:33.375
...whereupon he's escorted
into a cavernous type of an area

35:33.500 --> 35:38.167
where he meets a being he refers
to as "The Master" in his diary.

35:38.292 --> 35:41.167
The Master tells him
that they're highly disappointed

35:41.333 --> 35:43.917
in what humans are doing
with nuclear weapons

35:44.042 --> 35:47.958
and how they recently destroyed
Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

35:48.042 --> 35:51.083
and they really are concerned
about what is going on

35:51.208 --> 35:52.917
on the surface of the planet.

35:54.542 --> 35:56.750
They tell Admiral Byrd that

35:56.875 --> 35:59.583
they hope that humanity
will ultimately stop this.

35:59.708 --> 36:02.667
NARRATOR:
For UFO researchers,

36:02.750 --> 36:05.208
this account
from Admiral Byrd's diary

36:05.333 --> 36:07.708
is particularly significant

36:07.833 --> 36:11.125
due to the fact
that the modern UFO era began

36:11.208 --> 36:12.833
right after World War II

36:12.917 --> 36:16.792
and the detonation
of the first atomic bombs.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.167
It has also been noted

36:20.250 --> 36:22.750
that a high number
of UFO sightings

36:22.875 --> 36:24.875
have been reported
in the vicinity

36:25.042 --> 36:27.625
of nuclear missile silos.

36:27.750 --> 36:31.292
Admiral Byrd's story is
congruent with the stories

36:31.375 --> 36:34.292
that we hear
from numerous accounts

36:34.375 --> 36:37.458
of angelic
or extraterrestrial-type beings

36:37.542 --> 36:39.375
that are very concerned
about what humanity is doing

36:39.500 --> 36:40.958
with nuclear weapons.

36:42.458 --> 36:46.417
Just ask the Air Force officers
at the U.S. missile silos,

36:46.542 --> 36:49.208
the nuclear missile silos
that have seen their silos

36:49.333 --> 36:51.958
and their nuclear arms disarmed

36:52.042 --> 36:55.500
by what are perceived
to be extraterrestrial beings.

36:57.875 --> 37:00.000
They are very concerned
that we are ultimately

37:00.125 --> 37:01.875
not just going
to destroy ourselves

37:02.042 --> 37:05.833
but could harm our planet,
which is their world as well.

37:09.958 --> 37:12.917
NARRATOR:
If Admiral Byrd's
secret diary is authentic,

37:13.042 --> 37:15.208
does it reveal not only

37:15.333 --> 37:16.917
that there are highly
advanced beings

37:17.042 --> 37:19.708
living inside the earth but also

37:19.875 --> 37:24.000
that they are monitoring
what happens on the surface?

37:24.083 --> 37:28.583
According to the diary,
after this incredible encounter,

37:28.708 --> 37:31.292
Admiral Byrd was eager
to share his story

37:31.375 --> 37:34.667
but was ordered
to remain silent.

37:34.792 --> 37:38.000
HENRY:
Byrd comes back
after this experience.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.542
He is taken
to a government compound

37:40.708 --> 37:44.750
where he is told that he is
never to speak of this publicly

37:44.875 --> 37:47.750
and that everything
he says is-is classified.

37:49.792 --> 37:51.583
NARRATOR:
Could Admiral Byrd's story point

37:51.708 --> 37:53.333
to a profound connection

37:53.458 --> 37:55.250
between the ancient traditions

37:55.375 --> 37:57.667
of strange beings
living inside the earth

37:57.833 --> 38:00.750
and the modern-day
UFO phenomenon?

38:01.708 --> 38:04.500
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

38:04.625 --> 38:07.750
and believe we may be
fast approaching the time

38:07.875 --> 38:10.542
when we will
find ourselves face-to-face

38:10.667 --> 38:13.792
with the beings of Inner Earth.

38:23.167 --> 38:26.333
NARRATOR: According
to the teachings of kabbalah,

38:26.417 --> 38:28.708
on this date,
which marks the beginning

38:28.833 --> 38:31.667
of the seventh millennium
on the Judaic calendar,

38:31.792 --> 38:36.125
humankind will be introduced
to a profound new reality.

38:38.167 --> 38:39.667
According to the <i>Zohar,</i>

38:39.750 --> 38:41.792
at the beginning
of the seventh millennium,

38:41.917 --> 38:45.125
the gates of wisdom
will open on the Earth.

38:45.208 --> 38:47.167
That seems like a long way off.

38:47.333 --> 38:49.583
However, the <i>Zohar</i> also tells us

38:49.708 --> 38:52.167
that there will be
preliminary stages

38:52.250 --> 38:53.958
of the opening of this wisdom.

38:54.083 --> 38:59.750
Those stages, the kabbalists
teach, began around 1840.

38:59.875 --> 39:02.750
That's the beginning
of the Industrial Revolution,

39:02.875 --> 39:08.083
when suddenly humans are
taking control of nature.

39:08.208 --> 39:12.083
After that, we enter into
the technological revolution

39:12.208 --> 39:15.458
of the 1950s--
the invention of the computer,

39:15.542 --> 39:18.667
the transistor, and
other technologies like that.

39:18.792 --> 39:22.625
Now we're moving
into the nanotechnology,

39:22.750 --> 39:25.250
the artificial intelligence era.

39:25.375 --> 39:27.583
These are all believed
to be signs

39:27.708 --> 39:31.542
that we are ultimately
moving into this new era

39:31.708 --> 39:35.167
when immense wellsprings
of wisdom will open up.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.500
BIRNES:
At that point, there will be
an age of enlightenment

39:39.583 --> 39:41.000
that will come upon the planet

39:41.083 --> 39:43.792
and come upon all the life
on this planet.

39:43.917 --> 39:45.708
Now, isn't this fascinating,

39:45.875 --> 39:49.042
that the three Adamic religions

39:49.167 --> 39:51.083
all talk about the same thing?

39:52.042 --> 39:57.333
In Christianity, it is the
Second Coming and the Rapture.

39:57.458 --> 40:01.708
<i>-MAN: Allahu Akbar...</i>
-In Islam, it is
the Twelfth Imam.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.750
-(call to prayer)
-In Judaism,

40:03.875 --> 40:06.833
it is the Messiah who will come,

40:06.917 --> 40:10.542
and there will be
a whole new life on this planet.

40:10.667 --> 40:15.375
TZADOK:
When it comes time
for the Messiah to come,

40:15.500 --> 40:18.833
the Messiah will not come
from the skies,

40:18.958 --> 40:22.667
but rather the Messiah
and his army

40:22.792 --> 40:25.583
will come from Inner Earth.

40:25.708 --> 40:29.750
And there is Midrashic legend
that states in the

40:29.875 --> 40:32.542
"world to come,"
we will have first contact

40:32.708 --> 40:37.083
with those races in Inner Earth.

40:38.042 --> 40:40.792
NARRATOR:
Do the prophecies
of kabbalah confirm

40:40.875 --> 40:44.083
that even to this day,
humankind continues

40:44.208 --> 40:47.292
to share the planet
with other intelligent beings

40:47.375 --> 40:49.875
that occupy hidden realms?

40:51.125 --> 40:56.542
SALOFF:
There are many different
species, races of beings.

40:56.667 --> 41:01.250
Some of them came
from earlier times,

41:01.375 --> 41:05.167
and some of them come from now
but in just a different place.

41:05.333 --> 41:06.958
There's not only one or two.

41:07.042 --> 41:09.875
There are many,
many different races.

41:10.042 --> 41:14.333
And coming in contact
with other races or beings

41:14.458 --> 41:17.292
is coming in the next epoch.

41:19.083 --> 41:21.333
TZADOK:
The purpose of the teachings

41:21.417 --> 41:23.667
of the mystical traditions

41:23.750 --> 41:28.333
is to provide light
and redirection back

41:28.458 --> 41:31.167
to communion
with the higher domains.

41:31.250 --> 41:33.958
We are not alone

41:34.042 --> 41:38.750
as intelligent beings
upon our own Earth.

41:39.708 --> 41:43.667
NARRATOR: Is humanity
rapidly approaching the day

41:43.833 --> 41:46.583
when the secrets
of Inner Earth will be revealed?

41:46.708 --> 41:49.042
Have we been sharing the planet

41:49.208 --> 41:51.625
with other
intelligent life-forms

41:51.708 --> 41:53.333
for thousands of years?

41:53.500 --> 41:57.667
Perhaps it will be below
rather than above

41:57.792 --> 41:59.208
where we will
ultimately discover

41:59.375 --> 42:01.375
the truth about our past,

42:01.542 --> 42:05.500
our future,
and our alien ancestors.
