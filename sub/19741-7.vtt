00:00.172 --> 00:01.597
Previously on "The Catch"...

00:01.601 --> 00:03.195
Tessa Riley. Is that your real name?

00:03.198 --> 00:05.196
Perhaps you should go
directly to the source.

00:05.199 --> 00:06.264
Tell us, Mum.

00:06.266 --> 00:07.866
I mean, if you knew she was mine...

00:07.868 --> 00:08.900
Of course she was yours.

00:08.902 --> 00:09.976
Then why not tell me?

00:09.979 --> 00:11.703
Because I knew you'd want
to do the right thing...

00:11.705 --> 00:13.772
Settle down and be a "family."

00:13.774 --> 00:15.207
Tessa wants to join the Firm.

00:15.209 --> 00:17.085
No. She's not gonna
turn out like we did.

00:17.088 --> 00:18.143
She already has.

00:18.146 --> 00:19.671
Who the bloody hell are you?

00:19.674 --> 00:20.579
I'm Troy.

00:20.581 --> 00:22.013
What do you mean, you're the hard drive?

00:22.015 --> 00:23.248
When Blackwell needs data copied,

00:23.250 --> 00:25.817
I look at it once, it's in here forever.

00:25.819 --> 00:27.352
What if I could tell you
where your husband is?

00:27.354 --> 00:29.054
- What?
- Special Agent Edgar Diaz.

00:29.056 --> 00:31.423
Wait. Your husband is in the FBI?

00:31.425 --> 00:33.558
How weird was it seeing Ethan again?

00:33.560 --> 00:35.794
- Did you tell them that I killed that cop?
- No.

00:35.796 --> 00:37.028
I loved you.

00:37.030 --> 00:38.563
- Ethan.
- I was gonna marry you.

00:38.565 --> 00:40.699
Ethan Ward was innocent.

00:40.701 --> 00:42.534
I owe you an apology.

00:42.536 --> 00:43.869
I was wrong.

00:43.871 --> 00:46.541
There was a man in my
life before I met you.

00:46.544 --> 00:47.339
Ethan Ward.

00:52.746 --> 00:54.779
Can we talk?

00:59.010 --> 01:00.675
I know I should've called first,

01:00.678 --> 01:02.420
but I-I didn't want to
do this over the phone.

01:02.422 --> 01:04.456
- Ethan...
- When we broke up...

01:04.458 --> 01:07.034
I wasn't exactly at my best.

01:08.061 --> 01:10.128
And I did some things that I regret.

01:10.130 --> 01:11.930
Me too. It's okay.

01:11.932 --> 01:13.498
No, it's not okay.

01:14.568 --> 01:16.868
I need you to know that I'm better now.

01:16.870 --> 01:19.871
What I would love more
than anything is...

01:19.873 --> 01:21.640
could we just start again?

01:25.646 --> 01:26.611
Hey.

01:26.613 --> 01:28.647
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:30.117 --> 01:32.684
I'm so sorry. I didn't
realize you had company.

01:32.686 --> 01:35.053
- Hi. Ethan.
- Ethan.

01:35.055 --> 01:36.321
We were just talking about you.

01:37.257 --> 01:38.189
Oh.

01:38.191 --> 01:40.147
Ben is my fiancé.

01:41.028 --> 01:42.360
Wow.

01:42.362 --> 01:43.628
Wow. Congratulations.

01:43.630 --> 01:44.525
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:44.528 --> 01:45.330
Yeah.

01:46.566 --> 01:48.333
Well, don't let me interrupt.

01:48.335 --> 01:49.801
You guys... talk.

01:49.803 --> 01:52.137
No, I'm the one who's interrupting.

01:52.139 --> 01:54.205
I should go.

01:54.207 --> 01:55.707
I'll call you.

01:55.709 --> 01:56.808
Great.

01:56.810 --> 01:59.177
- Nice to meet you, Ben.
- You too.

01:59.179 --> 02:00.445
Unless...

02:02.049 --> 02:03.329
You want to come in for a drink?

02:06.453 --> 02:08.320
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

02:10.723 --> 02:13.792
I could definitely use one.

02:13.794 --> 02:16.795

02:22.936 --> 02:23.969
I see you redecorated.

02:23.971 --> 02:25.704
A... little.

02:25.706 --> 02:26.905
Oh, that's right.

02:26.907 --> 02:28.239
This used to be your house, too.

02:28.241 --> 02:29.207
For a while.

02:29.910 --> 02:31.042
You two live together?

02:31.044 --> 02:32.644
- Yeah.
- No.

02:32.646 --> 02:34.279
I'm here most nights.

02:34.281 --> 02:35.480
And how long have you been...

02:35.482 --> 02:37.115
- A year.
- Two months.

02:37.117 --> 02:39.651
- No, we've been together for...
- Dating for longer.

02:39.653 --> 02:41.553
But engaged for two months.

02:41.555 --> 02:42.721
Got it.

02:43.824 --> 02:44.923
Have you set a date?

02:44.925 --> 02:46.725
- June 29th.
- We haven't dec...

02:48.562 --> 02:52.364
We're still, uh, figuring it out.

02:55.268 --> 02:56.601
What do you do, Ben?

02:56.603 --> 02:59.337
- I am...
- He's in...

03:01.842 --> 03:03.555
Do you need to get that?

03:03.558 --> 03:04.876
Sorry.

03:07.180 --> 03:09.043
Everything okay?

03:09.046 --> 03:10.615
Sorry. I'm gonna have to go.

03:10.617 --> 03:11.916
What's wrong?

03:12.953 --> 03:14.352
- Can I help?
- Maybe.

03:14.354 --> 03:16.521
It okay if I call you
tomorrow at the office?

03:16.523 --> 03:17.795
- Of course.
- All right.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.591
Very nice to meet you, Ben.

03:19.593 --> 03:21.426
Likewise.

03:21.428 --> 03:23.495
We should all have dinner sometime.

03:25.321 --> 03:26.831
I'd love that.

03:26.833 --> 03:28.187
Me too.

03:28.301 --> 03:29.834
Me too.

03:35.842 --> 03:38.343
- Just say it.
- Say what?

03:38.346 --> 03:39.978
Say whatever it is
you've been dying to say

03:39.980 --> 03:41.813
since he left.

03:41.815 --> 03:42.914
He seems nice.

03:45.044 --> 03:47.519
Was I not supposed to tell
him that he's not a murderer?

03:47.521 --> 03:49.355
I think he probably
knows he's not a murderer.

03:49.358 --> 03:51.228
Well, I felt I owed him an apology.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.123
Obviously.

03:52.125 --> 03:54.025
And I did not expect him to come over.

03:54.027 --> 03:56.161
Yeah, well, who doesn't like a surprise?

03:56.163 --> 03:57.162
I know I do.

03:57.164 --> 03:58.763
Especially when the surprise

03:58.765 --> 04:01.166
has the piercing blue
eyes of a Siberian husky.

04:01.168 --> 04:02.801
Come on.

04:02.803 --> 04:04.235
Thank you.

04:04.237 --> 04:05.670
What do you think you're doing?

04:05.672 --> 04:07.072
I had a pretty exhausting day.

04:07.074 --> 04:08.606
I found a human hard drive,

04:08.608 --> 04:10.241
I met my fiancée's ex-fiancé,

04:10.243 --> 04:11.743
who apparently is not a murderer...

04:11.745 --> 04:12.744
Oh, is that so?

04:12.746 --> 04:13.976
And I have an early breakfast

04:13.979 --> 04:16.314
with the daughter I
never knew I had, so...

04:16.315 --> 04:19.017
You must be so tired.

04:19.019 --> 04:20.685
Oh, I am. I really am.

04:20.687 --> 04:24.022
Well, I guess you won't
mind if I call up Ethan.

04:25.025 --> 04:28.326
You're not calling Ethan.

04:32.766 --> 04:34.405
How did you two meet?

04:34.408 --> 04:35.767
Your uncle introduced us.

04:35.770 --> 04:37.068
Is that Uncle Rhys?

04:37.070 --> 04:38.736
- Mm-hmm.
- Your Uncle Rhys stranded us

04:38.738 --> 04:40.939
on a stolen yacht while he disappeared

04:40.941 --> 04:43.708
on a three-day opium
bender with two prostitutes.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.343
By the time the Italian
Coast Guard arrived,

04:45.345 --> 04:46.611
we were practically married.

04:46.613 --> 04:48.713
When do I get to meet Uncle Rhys?

04:48.715 --> 04:50.148
- How about never?
- That can wait.

04:50.150 --> 04:52.650
So, you met, fell in love,

04:52.652 --> 04:55.653
and, for 15 years, you
were happy together?

04:55.655 --> 04:58.623
I was. Or thought I was.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.325
Your mother and I
wanted different things.

05:00.327 --> 05:02.894
Yes, I wanted to steal
from Alice Vaughan.

05:02.896 --> 05:04.195
He wanted to marry her.

05:04.197 --> 05:06.965
So you gave up everything... The Firm,

05:06.967 --> 05:09.801
your whole life together... For a mark?

05:09.803 --> 05:11.603
It's very romantic.

05:11.605 --> 05:12.670
Thank you.

05:12.672 --> 05:15.673
No, I meant in a teenage-girl way.

05:15.675 --> 05:19.611
Which reminds me, we have
a birthday party to attend.

05:19.613 --> 05:22.547
- What?
- A Sweet 16 party.

05:22.549 --> 05:24.249
You know other teenagers?

05:24.251 --> 05:25.850
Is that so hard to believe?

05:25.852 --> 05:27.485
Will there be boys at this party?

05:27.487 --> 05:28.553
All girls, I'm afraid.

05:28.555 --> 05:30.155
And their parents will be there.

05:30.157 --> 05:31.222
Relax, Dad.

05:31.224 --> 05:32.524
What is that?

05:32.526 --> 05:34.926
Well, I'm not sending
her in there unarmed.

05:34.928 --> 05:36.861
Have you been to a kids' party in L.A.?

05:36.863 --> 05:38.596
Give me that.

05:42.702 --> 05:44.002
May I have a word?

05:50.243 --> 05:52.977
She's not bringing a gun
to a child's birthday party.

05:52.979 --> 05:53.978
It's not just any child.

05:53.980 --> 05:55.813
Do you remember Carl
and Galinda Mangels?

05:55.815 --> 05:57.982
- What about the Mangels?
- They were busted by the feds.

05:57.984 --> 05:59.517
Now, it turns out that their crew

05:59.519 --> 06:01.920
is less than happy with Carl's
successor... Raymond Taggart.

06:01.922 --> 06:03.555
Well, Taggart can't
handle Mangels' crew.

06:03.557 --> 06:05.156
If I can fold them into Kensington,

06:05.158 --> 06:06.958
I will finally have the crew that I need

06:06.960 --> 06:08.660
to be taken seriously in this country.

06:08.662 --> 06:10.261
Well, not if you're
recruiting teenage girls.

06:10.263 --> 06:11.696
It's Taggart's daughter's birthday.

06:11.698 --> 06:13.231
Tessa's gonna breeze
in, plant a few bugs,

06:13.233 --> 06:14.465
and I'll learn everything I need.

06:14.467 --> 06:15.833
By putting our daughter in danger.

06:15.835 --> 06:17.835
At her age, we were
doing this... and worse.

06:17.837 --> 06:19.904
Neither of us had a choice.
I was surviving, and you...

06:19.906 --> 06:22.140
I was learning the family
business, as is she.

06:22.142 --> 06:24.142
- It's too dangerous.
- It's a birthday party.

06:24.144 --> 06:25.543
The answer is no.

06:25.545 --> 06:27.045
Excuse me?

06:27.047 --> 06:29.214
She's not going. I forbid it.

06:29.216 --> 06:30.682
Ready?

06:30.684 --> 06:32.850
I am, but your father forbids it.

06:34.087 --> 06:36.688
Oh. That's so sweet.

06:36.690 --> 06:39.490
No one's ever cared what I do.

06:39.492 --> 06:40.925
Thank you, Daddy.

06:42.662 --> 06:43.995
Coming, Mum?

06:45.232 --> 06:47.532
You try telling a
teenage girl what to do.

06:52.005 --> 06:52.999
Hey.

06:53.002 --> 06:56.040
Remember our friend Troy,
the human hard drive?

06:56.042 --> 06:57.742
Uh-oh. Did you break him?

06:57.744 --> 06:59.344
Rhys, he's going back to the FBI.

06:59.346 --> 07:01.145
He's not. Justine's keeping him.

07:01.147 --> 07:02.380
I didn't see Troy as her type.

07:02.382 --> 07:04.549
Well, first of all,
Troy's everyone's type,

07:04.551 --> 07:06.484
and secondly, she's gonna
use him to kill her husband.

07:06.486 --> 07:07.518
- What?
- Exactly.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.653
You need to come home now.

07:08.655 --> 07:09.921
I hate being the sensible one.

07:09.923 --> 07:11.889
I can't. You're gonna
have to cover for me.

07:11.891 --> 07:14.025
I'm... taking a personal day.

07:14.027 --> 07:15.393
What? What... What is that?

07:15.395 --> 07:16.761
Is that a thing in this country?

07:16.763 --> 07:18.529
- Can I have one of those?
- No, not today.

07:18.531 --> 07:20.198
Whatever's going on, you can handle it.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.499
Since when? I...

07:21.501 --> 07:22.800
Hello?

07:25.272 --> 07:27.205
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:27.207 --> 07:28.373
Where are you going?

07:28.375 --> 07:30.942
Out. To get Troy some clothes.

07:30.944 --> 07:31.909
You'd better not be.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.978
Troy, where is she going?

07:33.980 --> 07:35.313
To take down some arms dealers.

07:35.315 --> 07:37.115
Troy, just because you know everything,

07:37.117 --> 07:38.916
doesn't mean you have to say everything.

07:38.918 --> 07:40.818
I go outside for 10 seconds.

07:40.820 --> 07:42.220
What the hell's going on?

07:42.222 --> 07:43.888
According to the file
I saw at the Bureau,

07:43.890 --> 07:45.356
Justine's husband was on assignment

07:45.358 --> 07:48.493
to infiltrate some arms
dealers, code-named Argosy.

07:48.495 --> 07:50.495
The operation was highly classified,

07:50.497 --> 07:52.196
then terminated two months later.

07:52.198 --> 07:53.464
That was six months ago.

07:53.466 --> 07:56.834
Everyone came home. Except for Eddie.

07:56.836 --> 07:58.803
And you never heard from him?

07:58.805 --> 08:00.538
No, I did.

08:00.540 --> 08:01.706
He e-mailed me

08:01.708 --> 08:04.142
saying he had fallen in
love with someone else.

08:04.144 --> 08:05.877
Which is why you want to kill him.

08:05.879 --> 08:07.912
Just really... hurt him.

08:11.384 --> 08:13.397
Argosy is Billy McLeland's outfit.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.486
Troy said they used to
operate out of Santa Barbara.

08:15.488 --> 08:16.621
Yeah, they still do.

08:17.557 --> 08:20.591
I may have done some business
with them in the past.

08:20.593 --> 08:21.793
So you know these guys?

08:21.795 --> 08:25.163
Very civilized... as gunrunners go.

08:25.165 --> 08:27.732
In fact... Yeah.

08:27.734 --> 08:29.862
They gave me these.

08:29.865 --> 08:31.169
Care for a stogie?

08:31.171 --> 08:32.303
When did they give you these?

08:32.304 --> 08:33.770
Uh, a few weeks back.

08:33.773 --> 08:36.474
These are Orbazos, from Cuba.

08:36.476 --> 08:37.909
No one here smokes these.

08:37.910 --> 08:39.711
Except for Eddie.

08:39.712 --> 08:41.746
This is proof he's still with Argosy,

08:41.748 --> 08:43.548
and thanks to the two of you,

08:43.549 --> 08:45.249
I know exactly how to find him.

08:46.886 --> 08:49.120
Ethan Ward is now our client?

08:49.122 --> 08:51.255
Not if it makes you guys uncomfortable.

08:51.257 --> 08:52.690
It doesn't make me uncomfortable.

08:52.692 --> 08:53.891
I'm just worried about him.

08:53.893 --> 08:55.827
I left him to work for you.

08:55.829 --> 08:57.462
And Ben is okay with this?

08:57.464 --> 08:59.797
He's pretending to be. He
even asked Ethan to dinner.

08:59.799 --> 09:00.765
- Uh, what?
- Wow.

09:00.767 --> 09:01.933
- When?
- Last night,

09:01.935 --> 09:03.634
when Ethan showed up at my door,

09:03.636 --> 09:05.737
and we all drank bourbon
like it wasn't weird.

09:05.739 --> 09:07.071
And was it not weird?

09:07.073 --> 09:08.673
No, it was super weird.

09:08.675 --> 09:10.675
Guys, he's here.

09:12.045 --> 09:14.612
- Detective Anderson.
- It's just "Val" now.

09:14.614 --> 09:16.280
Ethan, this is our in-house counsel

09:16.282 --> 09:18.082
and computer specialist, Sophie Novak.

09:18.084 --> 09:19.507
Sophie, pleasure to meet you.

09:19.510 --> 09:20.485
And, of course...

09:20.487 --> 09:22.854
- Ethan...
- Hey, nice to meet you. Ethan Ward.

09:24.290 --> 09:25.757
Well, listen, thank you, guys,

09:25.759 --> 09:27.158
for seeing me on such short notice.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.826
Um, it's kind of an emergency.

09:28.828 --> 09:30.962
Last night, me and my
entire Board of Directors

09:30.964 --> 09:33.364
had our personal
information published online.

09:33.366 --> 09:34.866
- What?
- Like what?

09:34.868 --> 09:37.435
Bank statements, tax
returns, confidential e-mails.

09:37.437 --> 09:39.003
- Ethan.
- Oh, my God.

09:39.005 --> 09:41.739
I've got deals falling
apart, investors pulling out.

09:41.741 --> 09:43.241
My Board is threatening to sue.

09:43.243 --> 09:44.842
You think it's someone on the inside?

09:44.844 --> 09:47.044
You know, at this point,
I'm not sure what to think.

09:48.081 --> 09:49.380
That's why I'm here.

09:49.382 --> 09:51.783
Well, we can't do anything
about what's already out there,

09:51.785 --> 09:55.219
but we can prevent anything
else from being exposed.

09:55.221 --> 09:56.854
Sophie, will upgrade your servers

09:56.856 --> 09:59.157
to our secure network
protocols, encrypt your files

09:59.159 --> 10:00.398
while we investigate the hack.

10:00.401 --> 10:02.160
And we should start with your employees.

10:02.162 --> 10:03.961
Maybe someone you've fired recently

10:03.963 --> 10:08.266
or someone from your past that
you've forgotten about entirely.

10:08.268 --> 10:11.769
As well as your
competitors, rivals, enemies.

10:11.771 --> 10:13.037
They stand the most to gain.

10:13.039 --> 10:14.071
Well, that's a long list.

10:14.073 --> 10:15.940
I've been doing this for a while,

10:15.942 --> 10:18.810
and, as you know, I haven't
always played by the rules.

10:18.812 --> 10:20.311
Oh, that's okay.

10:20.313 --> 10:22.914
Neither do we.

10:22.916 --> 10:25.450
It's very impressive what
you've built here, Allie.

10:25.452 --> 10:27.952
Be impressed after we fix this.

10:27.954 --> 10:30.121
I don't know if even you can do that.

10:30.123 --> 10:32.401
We will shut this down,
find out who did it,

10:32.404 --> 10:34.358
and shut them down.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.260
Thank you.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.800
We can't take Ethan's case.

10:42.802 --> 10:43.901
Why not?

10:43.903 --> 10:46.103
Because I know who hacked his company.

10:46.105 --> 10:47.638
Who was it?

10:47.640 --> 10:50.107
It was me.

10:54.562 --> 10:56.904
Please tell us you did not hack Ethan.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.373
- I didn't.
- Oh, thank God.

10:58.376 --> 11:00.026
I asked my friend Heather to.

11:00.028 --> 11:01.361
Oh, my God.

11:01.363 --> 11:02.762
Heather also worked for Anonymous?

11:02.764 --> 11:04.230
She still does, which is why,

11:04.232 --> 11:06.299
when we were investigating
Ethan for murder,

11:06.301 --> 11:08.236
I asked her to see if
she could find anything,

11:08.239 --> 11:09.936
and maybe she left a door open.

11:09.938 --> 11:11.304
Could she have leaked Ethan's data?

11:11.306 --> 11:12.605
No, she would never.

11:12.607 --> 11:14.574
She's very... truth and justice.

11:14.576 --> 11:15.542
You would love her.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.074
So, she's not a hacktivist

11:17.077 --> 11:19.579
working for an
anti-capitalist organization?

11:19.581 --> 11:21.247
No, she is.

11:21.249 --> 11:24.150
Which is why I never
should've asked for her help.

11:24.152 --> 11:26.019
It's why I'm quitting,
effective immediately.

11:26.021 --> 11:27.387
- What? No.
- Sophie.

11:27.389 --> 11:30.090
If I don't work here, Ethan
can't press charges against AVI.

11:30.092 --> 11:31.491
He won't press charges.

11:31.493 --> 11:32.625
I don't think.

11:32.627 --> 11:34.394
You guys could lose
your license if I stay.

11:34.396 --> 11:36.272
No. This is on me.

11:36.275 --> 11:37.764
I asked you to look into Ethan.

11:37.766 --> 11:39.366
You were doing your job,

11:39.368 --> 11:42.202
and you will continue to do
that by helping us fix this.

11:42.204 --> 11:43.770
I'll fix it.

11:43.772 --> 11:45.038
- Sophie...
- I will.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.906
I promise.

11:52.114 --> 11:53.646
This is for the birthday girl.

11:53.648 --> 11:54.714
What is it?

11:54.716 --> 11:56.816
Sterling silver hip flask.

11:56.818 --> 11:58.485
I was a girl once, too, you know.

11:58.487 --> 12:00.286
And these are for you.

12:00.288 --> 12:02.222
Plant mics with built-in transceivers.

12:02.224 --> 12:03.356
Mum, you shouldn't have.

12:03.358 --> 12:04.891
Now, position those all around the house

12:04.893 --> 12:06.059
and in the back garden.

12:06.061 --> 12:07.560
People have the most annoying habit

12:07.562 --> 12:09.929
in this town of discussing
business matters en plein air.

12:09.931 --> 12:12.065
Take these, as well.

12:12.067 --> 12:14.467
You didn't mention you were
sending me in as a wallflower.

12:14.469 --> 12:15.869
No, quite the opposite.

12:15.871 --> 12:18.338
I need you to mingle with
everybody at this party.

12:18.340 --> 12:20.240
Those are so I can help.

12:21.343 --> 12:23.410
Ah, so you'll be my eyes.

12:23.412 --> 12:25.245
As well as your ears.

12:27.783 --> 12:29.482
Oh, my God!

12:32.888 --> 12:34.387
Oh, my God.

12:38.593 --> 12:41.194
Hey!

12:41.196 --> 12:43.496
Remember, this is a job.

12:43.498 --> 12:45.098
No, this is a nightmare.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.489
I got eyes on Raymond Taggart.

12:47.492 --> 12:49.506
Forget about him. To get
the run of this place,

12:49.509 --> 12:50.909
you need to sidle up to his daughter,

12:50.911 --> 12:53.506
the birthday girl, Arabella Taggart.

12:53.508 --> 12:56.476
- Any sign of Arabella's BFF?
- Maddie Collins?

12:56.478 --> 12:59.045
I don't see her, so this is your window.

12:59.047 --> 13:00.647
Then here I go.

13:00.649 --> 13:01.781
You look gorgeous.

13:01.783 --> 13:04.350
Hi! Arabella, happy birthday.

13:04.352 --> 13:05.952
Maddie has told me all about you,

13:05.954 --> 13:08.254
and she said I just had
to come, and now I see why.

13:08.256 --> 13:09.956
Your house is amazing.

13:09.958 --> 13:11.791
Who... are you?

13:11.793 --> 13:12.725
Oh, my God.

13:12.727 --> 13:14.148
She didn't tell you I was coming?

13:14.151 --> 13:15.595
This is so embarrassing.

13:15.597 --> 13:16.979
Oh, well. I got you a present.

13:16.982 --> 13:18.565
Maddie turned me on to your beauty blog,

13:18.567 --> 13:20.900
so these are all the Nars spring colors.

13:20.902 --> 13:23.303
Honestly, though,
that shade is stunning.

13:23.305 --> 13:25.138
I wish I could pull off reds.

13:25.140 --> 13:27.107
Oh. Thanks.

13:27.109 --> 13:29.409
I mean, I think with your complexion,

13:29.411 --> 13:31.678
you could pull off a rose-toned red.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.913
How did you say you knew Maddie?

13:33.915 --> 13:36.116
She's my cousin. I'm Rachel, by the way.

13:36.118 --> 13:37.484
Is Maddie really not here?

13:37.486 --> 13:38.818
I don't think so.

13:38.820 --> 13:40.453
I am so sorry. Do you
mind if I call her?

13:40.455 --> 13:42.889
Flying a bit close
to the sun, aren't we?

13:42.891 --> 13:44.624
You know there's no
lipstick in that box.

13:44.626 --> 13:46.300
I also know it's bad manners

13:46.302 --> 13:47.468
to open your birthday gift

13:47.471 --> 13:49.529
before you've made your
eating-disordered friends

13:49.531 --> 13:51.030
say no to cake.

13:51.032 --> 13:52.866
Well done. You're
coming in loud and clear.

13:52.868 --> 13:54.200
Who's the girl on the sofa?

13:54.202 --> 13:56.336
The girl on the sofa
is Stephanie Porter.

13:56.338 --> 13:58.872
Just won state championship
for distance running.

13:58.874 --> 14:00.373
Stephanie!

14:00.375 --> 14:01.741
Rachel. We met at regionals?

14:01.743 --> 14:03.977
Sorry. I should say you
kicked my ass at regionals.

14:06.548 --> 14:07.981
Who's up next?

14:07.983 --> 14:10.850
The young woman in your
eyeline is Eve Hildebrand,

14:10.852 --> 14:14.020
aspiring poet and folk singer.

14:14.023 --> 14:17.061
I have played that breakup
song you wrote so many times.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.592
Your metaphors literally,
like, destroy me.

14:19.594 --> 14:20.827
Microphone 2 is live.

14:20.829 --> 14:22.762
Microphone 3 is live.

14:22.764 --> 14:24.164
Microphone 4 is live.

14:24.166 --> 14:25.331
Well done.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.534
They're all coming in loud and clear.

14:27.536 --> 14:30.136
Who are you, and why are you
telling people you know me?

14:30.138 --> 14:32.805
And that would be your
cousin Maddie Collins.

14:32.807 --> 14:34.440
Use your ammunition.

14:34.442 --> 14:37.577
Arabella's boyfriend, Tad, has
favorited a suspicious number

14:37.579 --> 14:39.512
of Maddie's photos and vice versa.

14:39.514 --> 14:40.980
You know, what's confusing is,

14:40.982 --> 14:43.082
I do have a cousin Rachel,
only you're not her.

14:43.084 --> 14:45.652
So maybe you should tell me what
the hell is going on, psycho?

14:45.654 --> 14:48.354
What's going on is you're
about to do everything I say.

14:48.356 --> 14:49.389
Why would I do that?

14:49.391 --> 14:51.257
'Cause I've seen all the naked selfies

14:51.260 --> 14:53.493
you've been sending to
Arabella's boyfriend, Tad.

14:53.495 --> 14:55.461
- What?
- What?

14:55.463 --> 14:57.897
Oh, yes. I've seen everything.

14:57.899 --> 14:59.766
So if you want to keep your best friend,

14:59.768 --> 15:02.602
you're going to turn around, put
on your biggest birthday smile,

15:02.604 --> 15:05.605
and tell anyone who asks
that I'm your cousin from...

15:05.607 --> 15:06.973
Where am I from again?

15:06.975 --> 15:08.104
- Newport Beach.
- Newport Beach.

15:08.106 --> 15:09.542
Exactly.

15:09.544 --> 15:10.877
Oh, and give me that bracelet.

15:12.031 --> 15:13.731
The bracelet, or I talk.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.820
You shaking down 16-year-olds now?

15:20.822 --> 15:21.854
What are you doing here?

15:21.856 --> 15:23.056
What is he doing here?

15:24.159 --> 15:25.959
I am taking our daughter home.

15:26.962 --> 15:28.962
How did you get in here?

15:28.964 --> 15:30.630
Seems my little princess
forgot her inhaler.

15:30.632 --> 15:31.731
Let's go. We're leaving.

15:31.733 --> 15:32.699
- Dad, no.
- Tessa.

15:32.701 --> 15:33.866
Just go, would you?

15:33.868 --> 15:35.268
I can handle these idiots.

15:35.270 --> 15:36.803
What about the guards on the grounds?

15:36.805 --> 15:38.972
Did you notice the 9-millimeter
bulge in their jackets?

15:38.974 --> 15:41.241
You think they're gonna care
that you're 15 years old?

15:41.243 --> 15:42.677
I just found out you exist.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.311
I would hate to lose you to
one of your mother's turf wars.

15:45.313 --> 15:47.680
It's my turf, too, now.

15:47.682 --> 15:49.849
And it would've been yours
if you hadn't left Mum.

15:51.019 --> 15:52.364
So help me.

15:52.367 --> 15:54.520
Just got to plant a few
microphones inside the house.

15:54.522 --> 15:56.189
Absolutely not.

15:56.191 --> 15:59.325
Then I'll make a scene in
front of those armed guards.

15:59.327 --> 16:00.326
It's your choice.

16:05.967 --> 16:07.967
This is the only cigar
lounge in the area

16:07.969 --> 16:09.602
that sells rare Cubans.

16:09.604 --> 16:11.638
It's got to be where
Eddie's getting his supply.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.240
And may I ask what you're
planning to do if we find him?

16:14.242 --> 16:16.609
Just want to talk.

16:16.611 --> 16:18.678
I want answers, closure.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.079
Well, the answer is,

16:20.081 --> 16:21.848
he fell in love with someone else.

16:21.850 --> 16:22.849
It happens.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.861
It could happen to you if you moved on.

16:24.864 --> 16:27.887
You don't just move on
from a seven-year marriage.

16:29.324 --> 16:30.990
What choice do you have?

16:32.027 --> 16:34.661
You have no idea how this feels, do you?

16:34.663 --> 16:38.798
You think I've never been betrayed?

16:38.800 --> 16:40.566
You could not be more wrong.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.871
Her name was Felicity.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.172
And where is she now?

16:46.174 --> 16:48.308
She's gone.

16:48.310 --> 16:50.877
But I know what happened.
I have my answers.

16:50.879 --> 16:54.247
And yet... no closure whatsoever.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:03.892 --> 17:04.891
Hello.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.358
I wonder if you can help me.

17:06.361 --> 17:09.028
Today is my birthday,
and a friend told me

17:09.030 --> 17:13.098
I might enjoy something
called an Orbazos?

17:13.101 --> 17:14.901
I'm afraid we don't sell those here.

17:16.003 --> 17:17.804
Hi. FBI.

17:17.806 --> 17:20.705
I couldn't help overhear you
lying to my friend just now.

17:20.709 --> 17:22.275
Are you saying that
if we go in the back,

17:22.277 --> 17:24.310
we won't find your secret stash?

17:24.311 --> 17:25.778
The embargo was lifted.

17:25.780 --> 17:28.247
Yes, it was... For cigars manufactured

17:28.249 --> 17:30.149
after 2014.

17:30.151 --> 17:34.153
So, you have a choice...
I can shut you down, or...

17:34.155 --> 17:35.000
Or what?

17:35.003 --> 17:36.756
You can tell me everything you know

17:36.758 --> 17:38.758
about this son of a bitch.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.400
Hey, could you help me break
into Heather's apartment?

17:47.402 --> 17:48.368
What?

17:48.370 --> 17:50.303
I called and texted and e-mailed,

17:50.305 --> 17:51.504
and she's not responding.

17:51.506 --> 17:52.839
We have to get in there.

17:52.841 --> 17:53.973
I need to get onto her network.

17:53.975 --> 17:55.842
Isn't this how the
whole thing started...

17:55.844 --> 17:58.811
By you asking your friend
Heather to do something illegal?

17:58.813 --> 18:01.245
Like you don't break into
people's houses all the time.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.882
Not for fun.

18:02.884 --> 18:06.018
Well, could you do it as a favor?

18:06.020 --> 18:07.920
If not for me, for Alice and Val.

18:07.922 --> 18:11.891
I messed this up. I
messed everything up.

18:11.893 --> 18:13.226
Please?

18:15.675 --> 18:16.841
Come on.

18:16.844 --> 18:18.998
Let's go break into
your friend's apartment.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.336
Sophie, I just checked in
with the police about Heather.

18:25.273 --> 18:27.507
Honey...

18:27.509 --> 18:30.576
they found her... in her apartment.

18:30.578 --> 18:33.112
She's gone.

18:33.114 --> 18:34.480
She's dead.

19:00.241 --> 19:04.710
What are you doing in
here? Come on. Let's go.

19:04.712 --> 19:07.413
I'm guessing she's yours.

19:07.415 --> 19:10.716
I caught her hiding this under my desk.

19:10.718 --> 19:13.186
You two aren't going anywhere.

19:19.788 --> 19:21.801
Thank you.

19:21.803 --> 19:23.503
Sweetie, if you want to go home...

19:23.505 --> 19:24.304
No.

19:24.306 --> 19:25.967
What did the police say?

19:25.970 --> 19:27.803
They found her body in the tub,

19:27.806 --> 19:30.225
a bottle of sleeping pills by the sink,

19:30.228 --> 19:33.313
but there was also slight
bruising around her neck,

19:33.315 --> 19:34.314
which suggests...

19:34.316 --> 19:36.482
That she was killed.

19:36.484 --> 19:37.884
Oh, my God.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.853
But there was no forced
entry, no sign of a struggle,

19:40.855 --> 19:43.656
not a single fingerprint, hair, or fiber

19:43.658 --> 19:45.191
that wasn't the victim's.

19:45.193 --> 19:46.453
So it was a professional hit.

19:46.456 --> 19:48.661
The police also found
Heather's bank statements.

19:48.663 --> 19:50.530
Two days after you
asked her to hack Ethan,

19:50.532 --> 19:54.167
she made a cash deposit
in the amount of $250,000.

19:54.169 --> 19:55.902
So she did sell Ethan's data?

19:55.904 --> 19:57.737
Or she was paid to leak it.

19:57.739 --> 19:58.838
And whoever bought the data

19:58.840 --> 20:00.873
sent somebody in to cover his tracks.

20:02.043 --> 20:03.743
So let's go find him.

20:03.745 --> 20:06.908
Soph, if the killer knows or finds out

20:06.911 --> 20:08.277
that you were part of the hack...

20:08.280 --> 20:09.714
We'll set you up in the security wing.

20:09.716 --> 20:10.783
- We'll put an agent with you.
- No. No.

20:10.785 --> 20:12.652
I don't want to just go sit in security.

20:12.654 --> 20:14.187
But they'll keep you safe.

20:14.189 --> 20:17.533
This guy killed my friend.
I have to do something.

20:17.536 --> 20:19.292
At least let me get you a
gun for your own protection.

20:19.294 --> 20:20.524
No, I don't need one.

20:20.527 --> 20:21.593
If we find out who he is,

20:21.596 --> 20:23.663
I can use my phone
and hack into his life

20:23.665 --> 20:24.998
a million different ways.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.934
I can hack into his car and
drive it off a cliff if I want.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.402
Copy that.

20:29.404 --> 20:31.504
We just need to find him.

20:31.506 --> 20:33.573
I may know someone who can help.

20:38.380 --> 20:39.679
There you are.

20:39.681 --> 20:41.375
What happened? Is your father with you?

20:41.378 --> 20:45.180
Oh, he's here all right.
They're both here, Margot.

20:45.183 --> 20:47.520
Raymond, darling. How are you?

20:47.522 --> 20:48.654
Are you well?

20:48.656 --> 20:50.056
Happy birthday to Arabella.

20:50.058 --> 20:51.724
They grow up so fast, don't they?

20:51.726 --> 20:53.793
- I found the microphones, Margot.
- Ah.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.728
What kind of parents use their daughter

20:55.730 --> 20:57.196
to move on another family?

20:57.198 --> 20:58.876
For the record, that is
exactly what I told her.

20:58.878 --> 20:59.610
Dad.

20:59.613 --> 21:00.645
Oh, for God sakes.

21:00.648 --> 21:02.001
Raymond, just tell me what you want.

21:02.003 --> 21:04.269
I think a $10 million cash penalty

21:04.271 --> 21:06.337
might discourage you from crashing

21:06.339 --> 21:08.373
any more of my parties, don't you?

21:08.375 --> 21:09.841
- $10 million?
- Are you joking?

21:14.514 --> 21:15.747
Honey, it's cake time.

21:15.749 --> 21:16.648
Two seconds, baby.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.717
What'd I say? Cake time.

21:21.989 --> 21:25.223
$10 million by 3:00 p.m., or
this party ends with a bang.

21:27.308 --> 21:28.774
I'm coming. Damn.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.138
Any sign of Eddie yet?

21:37.140 --> 21:38.839
Not yet, but then, not showing up

21:38.841 --> 21:40.441
is kind of his thing, isn't it?

21:40.443 --> 21:41.742
He'll show.

21:41.744 --> 21:44.078
He won't be able to resist
a box of fresh Orbazos.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.613
I'm just saying, anyone who chooses

21:45.615 --> 21:48.382
a box of cigars over you is...

21:48.384 --> 21:50.284
headed your way.

21:50.286 --> 21:52.153
Okay. Here we go.

22:03.366 --> 22:05.032
Turn around.

22:06.970 --> 22:08.436
Justine.

22:12.075 --> 22:13.941
You can't be here. It's not safe.

22:13.943 --> 22:16.210
It's not safe for me?

22:16.212 --> 22:18.446
You have fundamentally
misread this situation.

22:18.448 --> 22:19.914
I'm still undercover.

22:19.916 --> 22:22.183
Are you telling me
they left you in play?

22:22.185 --> 22:23.951
I will tell you everything.

22:23.953 --> 22:26.654
But you have to leave now.

22:28.291 --> 22:30.491
Impeccable timing. I need you.

22:30.493 --> 22:33.877
Much as I would love
to be of service to you,

22:33.880 --> 22:35.467
I need you to look at something for me.

22:35.470 --> 22:36.889
- I'm sending you a photo.
- Ooh.

22:36.892 --> 22:39.400
No, not that kind of
photo. Check your e-mail.

22:40.870 --> 22:43.437
Why am I looking at a photo of a
dead girl instead of your penis?

22:43.439 --> 22:46.374
It's a murder case. It
was staged as a suicide.

22:46.376 --> 22:48.772
You do know I'm not
the detective, right?

22:48.775 --> 22:50.041
I mean, allegedly, that's you.

22:50.044 --> 22:51.544
I know, but I thought,

22:51.546 --> 22:53.846
based upon your particular skill set...

22:53.848 --> 22:55.114
Murdering people.

22:55.116 --> 22:56.916
That you might be able
to identify the killer.

22:56.918 --> 22:58.417
Do you think we all just hang out,

22:58.419 --> 23:00.953
having drinks and trading pro tips?

23:00.955 --> 23:02.555
'Cause we do, occasionally.

23:02.557 --> 23:05.491
His name's Willy Grace.
Loves that bathtub gag.

23:05.493 --> 23:07.493
I'm sending you a photo of us all

23:07.495 --> 23:09.896
at the annual murderers'
Christmas party.

23:09.898 --> 23:11.189
Willy Grace, okay.

23:11.192 --> 23:13.232
Well, now that I've solved
your little murder mystery,

23:13.234 --> 23:14.800
I need you to help me
with a job this afternoon.

23:14.802 --> 23:16.802
Fine, but first, tell me
how to find Willy Grace.

23:16.804 --> 23:17.837
Oh, well you see, now, I'm afraid

23:17.839 --> 23:20.506
that will cost you a peen pic.

23:24.913 --> 23:26.579
What am I looking at?

23:26.581 --> 23:28.581
That is a photo of a
man named Willy Grace,

23:28.583 --> 23:31.984
also known as John A.C. Kennedy,
also known as Syd Quilling.

23:31.986 --> 23:33.319
That is the man who killed Heather.

23:33.321 --> 23:34.654
How did you find out?

23:34.656 --> 23:35.755
My source. Uh, wait.

23:35.757 --> 23:36.856
It's, uh, the only photo I got.

23:36.858 --> 23:38.057
Let me see.

23:38.059 --> 23:39.232
It's, uh...

23:39.235 --> 23:40.393
What do we know about him?

23:40.395 --> 23:41.761
Where he lives, what he drives,

23:41.763 --> 23:44.063
how much he charges for a
murder staged as a suicide.

23:44.065 --> 23:45.932
And how do we know all this?

23:45.934 --> 23:47.200
Yeah. Who's your source?

23:48.169 --> 23:50.436
You called Margot, didn't you?

23:50.438 --> 23:52.104
Should I not have?

23:52.106 --> 23:55.308
In my experience, sometimes a
criminal can be very helpful.

23:56.377 --> 23:58.878
Grab your phone. Let's
go get this Willy Grace.

24:06.854 --> 24:08.554
Willy Grace?

24:08.556 --> 24:10.756
I'm here to talk about Heather Reynolds.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.090
_

24:31.104 --> 24:32.077
_

24:38.304 --> 24:39.478
_

24:54.636 --> 24:55.901
Like I said...

24:57.263 --> 24:59.165
my friend and I would
like to have a word.

25:03.812 --> 25:05.879
Heather's killer is
stonewalling the cops.

25:05.881 --> 25:07.213
He's not giving up anything.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.615
Probably because whoever hired him

25:08.617 --> 25:10.183
is paying him a fortune to keep quiet.

25:10.185 --> 25:11.668
Think I might know who's paying him.

25:11.671 --> 25:12.552
- What?
- How?

25:12.554 --> 25:13.987
When I hacked his car's computer,

25:13.989 --> 25:15.288
I also accessed its call log.

25:15.290 --> 25:17.557
Six minutes after the
killer's NAV system

25:17.559 --> 25:18.791
puts him at Heather's place,

25:18.793 --> 25:20.593
he made a call to
someone named Marcus Nash.

25:20.595 --> 25:23.396
Of course he did. Who's Marcus Nash?

25:23.398 --> 25:25.398
We have to call Ethan.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.301
Marcus Nash has been trying to
drive me out of business for years.

25:28.303 --> 25:30.003
He was doing it to us
when we were together.

25:30.005 --> 25:30.837
How?

25:30.839 --> 25:32.972
Stealing contract bids,
poaching investors,

25:32.974 --> 25:33.940
spreading rumors.

25:33.942 --> 25:35.275
So you think Nash paid this girl

25:35.277 --> 25:37.076
- and then had her killed?
- To cover his tracks.

25:37.078 --> 25:39.646
And this guy is untouchable...
Commercial real estate,

25:39.648 --> 25:41.247
capital investments, tech companies.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.750
So we're just gonna let him get
away with this because he's rich?

25:43.752 --> 25:44.551
No.

25:44.553 --> 25:46.150
If he had Heather killed,

25:46.153 --> 25:47.863
who knows what else
he's gotten away with.

25:47.866 --> 25:49.656
We have to get this guy.

25:49.658 --> 25:50.491
We will.

25:50.494 --> 25:52.621
And you'll have all my
resources at your disposal.

25:52.624 --> 25:54.060
Thank you.

25:54.062 --> 25:55.862
What do you know about
Nash's current projects?

25:55.864 --> 25:58.131
Well, for the past two months,
Nash and I have been vying

25:58.133 --> 25:59.933
for the old Vauxhall
properties downtown.

25:59.935 --> 26:01.912
And now since he's cost you
your Board of Directors...

26:01.914 --> 26:03.369
He probably grabbed them.

26:03.371 --> 26:04.704
He has.

26:04.706 --> 26:06.005
Not only that, but he's holding

26:06.007 --> 26:07.407
a press event this afternoon

26:07.409 --> 26:09.108
to announce his development plans.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.543
Well, that sounds like a party.

26:11.713 --> 26:14.013
And you know how I love parties.

26:16.952 --> 26:18.117
Excuse me.

26:18.119 --> 26:19.819
Would you mind telling me the time?

26:19.821 --> 26:22.488
I'm just curious to know how
much longer it is I have to live.

26:22.490 --> 26:23.494
Relax.

26:23.497 --> 26:25.291
Taggart doesn't want a
gang war with Kensington.

26:25.293 --> 26:27.860
He just wants to put
your mother in her place.

26:27.862 --> 26:30.063
A sentiment with which
you clearly agree.

26:30.065 --> 26:31.798
Did I not tell you this was a bad idea?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.933
It would've been fine
if you hadn't shown up.

26:33.935 --> 26:35.401
Wait. Remind me why we're sitting here.

26:35.403 --> 26:36.836
Oh, that's right...
Because you got caught.

26:36.838 --> 26:38.071
You put me off my game.

26:38.073 --> 26:40.540
That's right. Blame the
parents. That's what children do.

26:40.542 --> 26:42.875
I was so close to
taking down Kensington.

26:42.877 --> 26:45.545
I hired hit men on three
different continents.

26:45.547 --> 26:47.113
You paid for stuff on the Internet.

26:47.115 --> 26:48.881
Any idiot with a
credit card can do that.

26:48.883 --> 26:50.917
A true con artist relies on her wits.

26:50.919 --> 26:53.086
A true con artist
doesn't fall for his mark.

26:53.088 --> 26:54.687
Well, that mark took you
down, if I recall correctly.

26:54.689 --> 26:57.123
Yes, and I am desperate
to return the favor.

26:57.125 --> 26:58.459
Tessa?

26:59.794 --> 27:01.494
- Can you help, please?
- She has asthma.

27:01.496 --> 27:02.629
Her inhaler's in my jacket pocket.

27:02.631 --> 27:04.290
- Just take it out of my pocket...
- Daddy...

27:04.292 --> 27:05.732
and give her her dose, please.

27:05.734 --> 27:06.933
- Daddy.
- Honey, hold on.

27:06.935 --> 27:09.055
We're getting your medicine.
Just hang in there, okay?

27:12.271 --> 27:14.404
That was a very
convincing asthma attack.

27:14.407 --> 27:15.608
Thank you.

27:15.610 --> 27:17.538
Now please tell me a true con artist

27:17.541 --> 27:19.007
knows how to get out of these.

27:20.282 --> 27:21.414
Allow me.

27:22.817 --> 27:24.384
There you are.

27:24.386 --> 27:25.618
Thank you.

27:30.525 --> 27:33.526
A new Jaguar. Arabella's cleaning up.

27:33.528 --> 27:35.995
We're getting out of here.

27:37.632 --> 27:40.266
Oh, my gosh!

27:40.268 --> 27:42.568
Thank you so, so much, Daddy!

27:42.570 --> 27:44.837
You're welcome, baby.

27:45.974 --> 27:47.307
Did my wife order this?

27:47.309 --> 27:48.708
From Margot Bishop.

27:48.710 --> 27:52.011
She said the bonus you
discussed is in the trunk.

27:52.013 --> 27:55.214
Oh, well, please, tell Ms. Margot Bishop

27:55.216 --> 27:58.318
to expect her delivery shortly.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.986
Thank you.

27:59.988 --> 28:01.287
Park it in the garage.

28:01.289 --> 28:03.723
Take the cash out the trunk, count it.

28:13.401 --> 28:14.500
Surprise.

28:19.507 --> 28:21.274
You invited your husband here?

28:21.276 --> 28:23.182
I couldn't bring him back to our house.

28:23.185 --> 28:26.212
McLeland could be watching.
The FBI could be watching.

28:26.214 --> 28:27.647
But it's okay for Eddie

28:27.649 --> 28:29.749
to lead a platoon of arms dealers here.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.117
Aren't you already a customer?

28:31.119 --> 28:33.319
Thank you, Troy.

28:33.321 --> 28:34.987
Yeah, thank you, Troy.

28:34.989 --> 28:36.689
Sorry.

28:36.691 --> 28:39.425
It doesn't matter. He's
not gonna show up, anyway.

28:40.995 --> 28:42.628
I hate this guy.

28:44.065 --> 28:45.264
Hey.

28:46.534 --> 28:48.067
Don't let him sweet-talk you.

28:48.069 --> 28:50.036
Give me some credit.

28:55.143 --> 28:56.809
- Should we give them some privacy?
- No.

28:56.811 --> 28:58.745
Why would we want to do that?

29:10.237 --> 29:11.303
Which way out?

29:11.306 --> 29:12.725
There were two guards on the front door

29:12.727 --> 29:14.594
when I came in... That's a no-go.

29:14.596 --> 29:17.263
So we'll leave the way I came in.

29:17.265 --> 29:18.564
Don't move.

29:18.566 --> 29:21.634
See, this is why I hate guns.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.239
And this is why I love them. Hello, Mum.

29:26.241 --> 29:28.802
I just gave our daughter
the "no gun" speech.

29:28.805 --> 29:30.005
Well, thanks to me and my gun,

29:30.007 --> 29:31.241
you'll live to bore her with it again.

29:31.243 --> 29:32.845
Can we insult each other
on the move, please?

29:32.847 --> 29:34.480
- We got to go.
- We're not going anywhere.

29:34.482 --> 29:36.616
Taggart just tried to
ransom you and extort me.

29:36.618 --> 29:37.950
That doesn't go unanswered.

29:37.952 --> 29:39.604
- Margot.
- What are you planning to do?

29:39.607 --> 29:41.654
Make this a party he'll never forget.

29:48.670 --> 29:51.570
The Bureau ended their
operation six months ago.

29:51.572 --> 29:52.571
They made arrests.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.005
But they didn't get McLeland.

29:54.007 --> 29:56.375
And if they'd listened to me...

29:56.377 --> 29:58.310
if they'd waited for
even two more weeks,

29:58.312 --> 29:59.411
I could've delivered him.

29:59.413 --> 30:00.946
Wait a minute.

30:00.948 --> 30:03.148
Are you saying you
stayed under voluntarily?

30:03.150 --> 30:04.683
Baby...

30:04.685 --> 30:05.650
Oh, my God.

30:05.652 --> 30:06.885
I can get him.

30:06.887 --> 30:08.687
- I know I can.
- What is wrong with you?

30:08.689 --> 30:10.689
McLeland is arming terrorists.

30:10.691 --> 30:12.924
So you stay undercover, by yourself,

30:12.926 --> 30:15.927
and then divorce me via e-mail?

30:15.929 --> 30:17.929
Wait. Justine.

30:19.533 --> 30:21.533
I didn't want you wasting your life,

30:21.535 --> 30:26.505
waiting for a-a dead man
who was never coming home.

30:26.507 --> 30:31.309
Which basically means
he chose work over you.

30:31.311 --> 30:32.911
I'm sorry. W-Who are these people?

30:32.913 --> 30:35.180
These are the people who
actually care about Justine.

30:35.182 --> 30:37.082
These are the people who have her back

30:37.084 --> 30:39.818
and won't let you hurt her again.

30:39.820 --> 30:41.353
I'm Troy.

30:41.355 --> 30:43.822
Okay. That was sweet, but...

30:43.824 --> 30:46.525
H-He's right. The longer I'm with you...

30:46.527 --> 30:48.193
the less safe you are.

30:48.195 --> 30:49.995
And the less safe you are.

30:49.997 --> 30:52.864
Just please know I
never meant to hurt you.

30:52.866 --> 30:56.768
I never stopped loving you.

30:56.770 --> 30:58.637
And if I can get out of this alive...

30:58.639 --> 31:00.005
Oh, you will.

31:00.007 --> 31:02.841
Because we're gonna figure
out what to do about McLeland,

31:02.843 --> 31:04.843
and then we're gonna get you out.

31:11.852 --> 31:15.020
Wow. Marcus Nash went all out.

31:15.022 --> 31:16.788
So did you.

31:16.790 --> 31:18.523
Ben is a very lucky man.

31:18.525 --> 31:20.258
I will tell him you say so.

31:20.260 --> 31:23.395
He's okay with us working together?

31:23.397 --> 31:25.230
He doesn't have a say in the matter. Mm.

31:25.232 --> 31:26.965
And he's fine with it.

31:26.967 --> 31:28.366
What about you?

31:28.368 --> 31:30.101
Oh, I'm fine with it, too, yeah.

31:30.103 --> 31:32.443
No, I mean, are you seeing anyone?

31:32.446 --> 31:34.005
Not that it's any of my business.

31:34.007 --> 31:35.707
Right, 'cause we're
just working together.

31:40.280 --> 31:41.279
Speaking of which...

31:41.281 --> 31:42.614
Marcus.

31:42.616 --> 31:44.115
Ethan.

31:44.117 --> 31:45.684
Alice.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.853
What a surprise... The
two of you back together.

31:49.379 --> 31:50.956
What's surprising is that people

31:50.958 --> 31:52.390
are still willing to
do business with you

31:52.392 --> 31:53.837
after everything you've done.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.827
Do you recognize this woman?

31:55.829 --> 31:57.162
Heather Reynolds.

31:57.164 --> 31:59.264
These are crime-scene photos,

31:59.266 --> 32:02.067
implicating an assassin
named Willy Grace,

32:02.069 --> 32:04.703
who called you six minutes
after he murdered her,

32:04.705 --> 32:07.339
according to these phone records.

32:07.341 --> 32:09.040
Bold presentation,

32:09.042 --> 32:11.910
but it'll never hold
up in a court of law.

32:11.912 --> 32:15.146
What about the court of public opinion?

32:15.148 --> 32:17.282
Your press packet.

32:17.284 --> 32:21.119
Bold presentation.

32:21.121 --> 32:22.821
And we made sure that our people

32:22.823 --> 32:25.123
put one of those on
every chair in this room.

32:27.060 --> 32:29.895
I think the media's gonna have
more than a few questions for you.

32:29.897 --> 32:31.296
And not just about the property.

32:35.469 --> 32:36.835
Get these two out of here now!

32:42.843 --> 32:44.910
What?

32:44.912 --> 32:47.779
It's been a while since we
were thrown out of a party.

32:49.650 --> 32:51.550
This is everything that is wrong

32:51.552 --> 32:53.685
with raising children in Los Angeles.

32:53.687 --> 32:56.388
This is why we need to take
our daughter out of here now.

32:56.390 --> 32:57.422
Too late.

32:57.424 --> 32:59.124
I'm already getting
ideas for my Sweet 16.

32:59.126 --> 33:01.493
Just help me with Taggart,
and then we'll leave.

33:01.495 --> 33:02.727
I am not helping you kill Taggart

33:02.729 --> 33:04.062
at his daughter's birthday party.

33:04.064 --> 33:06.398
The plan was never to kill
him, just to take over his crew.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.766
How do we do that?

33:07.768 --> 33:09.134
Thanks to your fine work,

33:09.136 --> 33:11.036
I've overheard every
conversation in this place

33:11.038 --> 33:12.571
for the last three hours.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.639
Most of the parents here
are Taggart's employees,

33:14.641 --> 33:16.041
and they've got grievances.

33:16.043 --> 33:17.309
Which you plan to start airing.

33:17.311 --> 33:19.010
Precisely.

33:19.012 --> 33:21.112
But how do we do that
without getting caught?

33:21.114 --> 33:22.314
Taggart's just got word

33:22.316 --> 33:24.683
he's got a rather messy
problem in his garage,

33:24.685 --> 33:27.686
so he's off to clean it up,
which puts us in the clear.

33:27.688 --> 33:28.853
So if we all work together,

33:28.855 --> 33:30.889
I'll have us out of
here in 10 minutes, tops.

33:30.891 --> 33:31.890
Give you five.

33:31.892 --> 33:32.791
I'll take it.

33:32.793 --> 33:34.526
Thanks, Daddy.

33:34.528 --> 33:35.961
Now it's a party.

33:35.963 --> 33:37.128
First, there's Scotty Beene.

33:37.130 --> 33:38.944
Taggart's been cutting
him out of the profits

33:38.947 --> 33:40.013
for the last several months.

33:40.015 --> 33:41.466
Scotty, right? Ted.

33:41.468 --> 33:43.501
- Have we met?
- East Coast operations.

33:43.503 --> 33:44.638
Hell of a month, right?

33:44.641 --> 33:46.905
Got to say, really generous
of Raymond to up our weeklies.

33:46.907 --> 33:48.873
- You got a raise?
- You didn't?

33:48.875 --> 33:50.342
While you enrage the husbands,

33:50.344 --> 33:51.716
I'll rile up the trophy wives.

33:51.719 --> 33:54.179
I can't believe that I'm
just meeting you all now.

33:54.181 --> 33:56.548
I feel like I have no one
to talk to except for Ted,

33:56.550 --> 33:59.217
and he just drones on
about work and his buddies

33:59.219 --> 34:01.620
and his $10k stipend.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.455
Did you say $10k?

34:03.457 --> 34:05.657
I mean, everyone is
paid the same, right?

34:05.659 --> 34:07.525
It seems Taggart's
not just a cheapskate.

34:07.527 --> 34:09.260
He's also a bit of a ladies man.

34:09.262 --> 34:10.996
I really shouldn't say.

34:10.998 --> 34:12.697
Debbie's so nice, and...

34:12.699 --> 34:14.099
her dad is right there.

34:14.101 --> 34:15.233
What is it?

34:15.235 --> 34:16.801
Lydia said that Maddie said

34:16.803 --> 34:19.938
that Arabella told her
that her dad, Mr. Taggart...

34:19.940 --> 34:20.972
Mm-hmm.

34:20.974 --> 34:23.108
Is having an affair with Debbie's mom.

34:23.110 --> 34:25.275
Oh, my God!

34:25.277 --> 34:26.610
You can't tell anyone.

34:26.612 --> 34:28.380
We're gonna spread so much dirt

34:28.382 --> 34:30.715
on Raymond Taggart to his employees

34:30.717 --> 34:32.817
that by the time he
returns to this party,

34:32.819 --> 34:34.985
he'll be walking into a mutiny.

34:34.987 --> 34:37.155
Of course I was gonna pay you.

34:37.157 --> 34:39.524
Of course your husband
will get his stipend.

34:39.525 --> 34:40.891
Of course not, Frank.

34:40.893 --> 34:42.402
I-I wouldn't sleep with your wife.

34:42.406 --> 34:43.706
Who told you that?

34:44.902 --> 34:46.731
Seems you're not very popular, Raymond.

34:46.733 --> 34:48.733
Not only are your people cross with you,

34:48.735 --> 34:50.368
but most of them have defected.

34:50.370 --> 34:52.170
- Defected?
- To the Kensington Firm.

34:52.172 --> 34:53.804
Pleasure doing business with you.

34:53.806 --> 34:56.206
You watch your step, little girl.

34:56.208 --> 34:59.511
You take what I love,
I'll take what you love.

34:59.513 --> 35:01.680
Raymond, father to father,

35:01.682 --> 35:03.748
if you come anywhere
near my daughter again,

35:03.750 --> 35:05.817
I will do more than break your wrist.

35:05.819 --> 35:06.951
My wrist?

35:06.953 --> 35:08.653
Aah!

35:08.655 --> 35:09.888
Now we can go.

35:09.890 --> 35:12.924
You...

35:14.594 --> 35:17.929
She's banging Tad, by the way.

35:17.931 --> 35:19.698
What?!

35:42.327 --> 35:44.861
I just wanted to say thank you.

35:44.863 --> 35:46.162
For what?

35:46.164 --> 35:48.097
For going along with all of this.

35:48.099 --> 35:49.599
As if I had a choice.

35:49.601 --> 35:51.634
And for trying to protect me.

35:51.636 --> 35:53.469
Fat lot of good that did.

35:53.471 --> 35:55.838
And for letting Eddie
and me spend the night.

35:57.342 --> 35:58.641
What?

35:58.643 --> 35:59.909
Here?

35:59.911 --> 36:01.744
I can't take him back to my place.

36:01.746 --> 36:03.379
So you're just gonna shag him here?

36:03.381 --> 36:05.882
I haven't seen him in eight months.

36:07.986 --> 36:12.455
Well, I'm glad you got the
answers you were looking for.

36:12.457 --> 36:13.756
Thank you.

36:15.660 --> 36:16.926
And who knows?

36:16.928 --> 36:19.462
Maybe it's not too late
for you and Felicity.

36:19.464 --> 36:21.698
No, i-it is.

36:23.101 --> 36:24.567
When Felicity betrayed me,

36:24.569 --> 36:27.770
I wasn't quite as forgiving as you.

36:38.349 --> 36:40.850
That was the scene at a
disastrous press conference

36:40.852 --> 36:42.652
held by Marcus Nash just hour ago,

36:42.654 --> 36:44.821
where it was revealed
that he may have ties

36:44.823 --> 36:46.823
to the murder of Heather Reynolds.

36:46.825 --> 36:49.625
Nash & Partners stock
is expected to plummet,

36:49.627 --> 36:53.229
as the FBI has now launched an
investigation into the C.E.O...

36:53.231 --> 36:55.431
The feds made a deal
with Heather's killer.

36:55.433 --> 36:56.799
He confessed.

36:56.801 --> 36:58.301
Nash paid him for the hit.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.569
We got him, Soph.

36:59.571 --> 37:01.304
He's going away for good.

37:01.306 --> 37:02.572
Thanks, you guys.

37:05.844 --> 37:07.610
Maybe give her a minute, hmm?

37:07.612 --> 37:11.481
And then...

37:11.483 --> 37:13.182
it's good working with you again, Danny.

37:13.184 --> 37:15.351
You did remember. He remembered.

37:17.055 --> 37:19.722
Everything looks good.
Nash is in police custody.

37:19.725 --> 37:21.301
They'll need all of our statements.

37:21.304 --> 37:23.025
Happy to help out any way I can.

37:23.027 --> 37:25.128
Oh, how the times have changed.

37:26.765 --> 37:28.297
- Oh.
- Oh, ignore it.

37:28.299 --> 37:31.000
Come on. We're celebrating.

37:31.002 --> 37:34.169
Be right back.

37:39.110 --> 37:39.855
Hey.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.677
I'd almost forgotten
the sound of your voice.

37:41.679 --> 37:43.412
It's been less than 24 hours.

37:43.414 --> 37:45.982
Which is officially too long.

37:45.984 --> 37:47.884
How are you? How was your day?

37:47.886 --> 37:51.521
It was, uh... actually...

37:51.523 --> 37:52.989
pretty great.

37:52.991 --> 37:54.731
How was yours?

37:59.731 --> 38:01.030
It wasn't terrible.

38:01.032 --> 38:03.833
So, I am just wrapping
up here at the office.

38:03.835 --> 38:05.693
Yeah, we're just ordering
a quick dinner here.

38:05.696 --> 38:07.670
Oh. You still there with Tessa?

38:07.672 --> 38:09.205
Unless you need me.

38:09.207 --> 38:11.240
No, no. Take your time.

38:11.242 --> 38:13.209
I'll call you later.

38:13.211 --> 38:15.545
Absolutely, or I'll call you.

38:28.259 --> 38:30.226
You want your usual... Steak-frites...

38:30.228 --> 38:31.627
Or do you want something else?

38:31.629 --> 38:33.629
- Steak-frites sounds great.
- Your cholesterol.

38:35.567 --> 38:37.800
Do you think this is what
it would've been like?

38:37.802 --> 38:39.202
What what would've been like?

38:39.204 --> 38:42.104
Us. As a family.

38:46.077 --> 38:48.744
I suppose so.

38:48.746 --> 38:50.012
Uh, room service. Yeah, hi.

38:50.014 --> 38:53.015
Uh, I'd like to start by
ordering three martinis.

38:53.017 --> 38:54.684
You are not ordering her a martini.

38:54.686 --> 38:55.685
Why? She asked for it.

38:55.687 --> 38:56.819
She's gonna ask for a lot of things.

38:56.821 --> 38:57.854
That doesn't mean we're just supposed

38:57.856 --> 38:59.455
- to give them to her.
- It's one drink.

38:59.457 --> 39:01.057
- She earned it.
- Absolutely not.

39:01.059 --> 39:02.825
You are being ridiculous.

39:02.827 --> 39:04.227
You are being irresponsible.

39:04.230 --> 39:07.263
Tessa, your father's
putting his foot down again.

39:07.265 --> 39:08.839
Oh, I love it when he does that.

39:08.842 --> 39:10.967
Do it again, Dad, so I can see.

39:10.969 --> 39:12.301
I take it back.

39:12.303 --> 39:13.684
This is what it would've been like.

39:17.742 --> 39:19.542
Uh, yes, steak-frites...

39:23.414 --> 39:27.316
Are those two...

39:27.318 --> 39:28.451
Maybe.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.019
- I don't actually know.
- Mm.

39:30.021 --> 39:31.821
That's what it means to be the boss.

39:31.823 --> 39:34.156
All the problems and none of the gossip.

39:34.158 --> 39:36.525
But I love the gossip.
That was my favorite part.

39:37.567 --> 39:39.451
All right, well, I
have some for you, then.

39:39.454 --> 39:40.963
Mm.

39:40.965 --> 39:42.431
Her name's Gretchen.

39:42.433 --> 39:44.834
Your girlfriend.

39:44.836 --> 39:47.103
No, my fiancée, actually.

39:47.105 --> 39:50.206
Wow.

39:50.208 --> 39:51.514
That is good gossip.

39:51.517 --> 39:53.109
I'd love you both to meet. I ju...

39:53.111 --> 39:54.877
I... I think you'd really like her.

39:54.879 --> 39:57.580
Yeah, I'm sure I will.

40:16.334 --> 40:19.135
Tessa, did you forget something?

40:19.137 --> 40:21.671
Felicity.

40:25.710 --> 40:27.910
Aah!

40:27.912 --> 40:31.647
Who's Tessa? Should I be jealous?

40:31.649 --> 40:33.249
I thought you were in India.

40:33.251 --> 40:34.617
Does Rhys know you're here?

40:34.619 --> 40:36.686
No, he doesn't.

40:36.688 --> 40:39.488
I didn't come to see him.

40:39.490 --> 40:41.190
Well, what did you come for?

40:41.192 --> 40:44.827
I've come to cause a bit of trouble.

40:44.829 --> 40:47.096
Are you up for it?
