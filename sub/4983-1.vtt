How do you do?

00:22.398 --> 00:25.525
Mr. Rob Zombie feels it would
be a little unkind

00:25.609 --> 00:28.903
to present this picture without
just a word of friendly warning.

00:28.987 --> 00:33.449
We are about to unfold
the story of El Superbeasto,

00:33.534 --> 00:35.243
a man of action.

00:35.327 --> 00:38.913
It is one of the strangest
tales ever told.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.749
I think it will thrill you.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.960
It may shock you.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.921
It might even horrify you.

00:47.005 --> 00:51.217
So if any of you feel that you
do not care to subject your nerves

00:51.301 --> 00:52.760
to such a strain,

00:52.845 --> 00:55.847
now's your chance to, uh--

00:55.931 --> 00:58.683
Well, we warned you.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.847
All right now, bitches, listen up.

02:19.932 --> 02:23.518
The director's on the set.
The director is on the set!

02:23.602 --> 02:27.271
Howdy-doodly-doo, ladies?
Gather round, gather round.

02:27.356 --> 02:29.899
Big Time Movie Casting
is now in session.

02:29.983 --> 02:34.904
I've got a very special porno--
I mean art film-- to shoot today.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.782
[chuckles]
So, time to get a-crack-a-lackin'.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.952
You heard him.
Get your asses a-crack-a-lackin'!

02:41.036 --> 02:44.580
Now just to let you know, I'm not
one of those shallow Hollywood types

02:44.665 --> 02:46.207
that casts based on looks.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.875
I'm all about pure talent.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.919
I want the audience to believe
in the characters,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.921
to experience the emotions,

02:52.005 --> 02:54.632
breathe in the spicy meatball man,

02:54.716 --> 02:55.925
as they breathe life itself.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.010
All right, Granny,

02:58.095 --> 03:00.930
tell me a little about
why I should ignore the fact

03:01.014 --> 03:03.015
that you're, like,
a thousand years old.

03:03.100 --> 03:07.770
In 1910, I attended the
Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts

03:07.855 --> 03:11.941
- on full scholarship, winning the...
- Next.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.651
...stunning portrayal of Blanche Dubois

03:13.735 --> 03:16.153

Oh my God!

03:16.238 --> 03:19.365
I know I'm, like,
totally like a star.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.284
I know it!
[giggles]

03:21.368 --> 03:22.368
Perfect perfect!

03:22.452 --> 03:24.412
You're hired. Next.

03:24.496 --> 03:27.915
I dig into the inner texture
of the soul of the character

03:28.000 --> 03:30.376
- and reflect society's issues with women...
- [snoring]

03:30.460 --> 03:32.753
- ...and their hatred of the vagina.
- Next!

03:32.838 --> 03:34.130
- Let me tell you--
- No.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.965
- I'd really like to--
- Next!

03:36.049 --> 03:37.967
- People make me nauseous.
- No way!

03:38.051 --> 03:39.468
- Hello!
- Nope.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.053
- Who do I have to fuck--
- No.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.889
- Oh, Edgar, why did you--
- Ugh!

03:42.973 --> 03:44.599
- I'm ready for my-- whoa!
- Next!

03:44.683 --> 03:47.184
Well, hello, honeypants.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.187
[giggles]
I think a good tan is as important

03:50.272 --> 03:51.522
as a good script, you know?

03:51.607 --> 03:54.233
Also, I can't really read so good,

03:54.318 --> 03:57.153
but I can do 300 crunches
without stopping.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.530
Words are so overrated.

03:59.615 --> 04:03.284
But on the other hand, tight abs--
so underrated.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.369
[breathing]
Oh, oh my God.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.996
Quiet on the set!

04:20.385 --> 04:22.720
Yeah yeah, I got it.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.223
Man #2:
Okay, and we're still rolling, mate.

04:26.308 --> 04:30.061
Mama mia, how about
some delicious sauce

04:30.145 --> 04:33.022
for the spicy a-jumbo meatballs?

04:33.106 --> 04:35.858
Ow! What are you,
like totally weird?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.027
That's, like, so hot!

04:38.111 --> 04:41.364
If it's not a-hot, how am I
gonna melt-a the cheese?

04:41.448 --> 04:43.658
Luigi, she wonder why
it is too hot.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.326
The cheese a-not gonna melt!

04:56.922 --> 05:00.091

Get ready!
Holy monkey!

05:36.712 --> 05:38.170
That wasn't in the script!

05:45.012 --> 05:46.178
Here we go again.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.563
Please tell me
that was good for focus.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.064
Yeah, focus was good.
We got it.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.107
Check that gate, baby!

05:58.191 --> 06:00.109
Yeah, good gate.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.237
That's a wrap. Make sure
you hand in your paperwork

06:03.321 --> 06:06.866
to Production before you leave.

06:06.950 --> 06:11.120
Whoo! After a hard day
of directing-slash-acting,

06:11.204 --> 06:14.081
there's only one way
I like to chillax.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.916
Titty bar!

06:17.461 --> 06:20.087
Now let's see.
Confidence? Check.

Frighteningly chiseled

06:37.481 --> 06:41.025
Carry on, my simpleminded,
minimum-wage friend.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.527
Yeah, I only kill these things
on the side.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.947
I got me an application in
to the Dinky Donuts.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.366
I know I know,
you want an autograph.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.493
Oh, that'd be great.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.453
Sorry, I don't sign.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.872
I feel it damages
my artistic credibility.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.166
- What?
- Oh, fine.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.919
Take a headshot, and here,
a Superbeasto bumper sticker.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.588

Now lay off!

- Dandruff Away shampoo...
- Wow, this is embarrassing.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.897
It's my commercial.
[chuckles]

12:53.982 --> 12:56.316
On the TV, right up there.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.193
...have any more flakes
on my clothes.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.362
People thought
I either didn't shower

13:00.447 --> 13:02.406
or had a bad coke problem.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.991
Announcer: May cause anal bleeding,
penis shrinkage, migraine headaches,

13:04.075 --> 13:05.909
and nipple crumbling.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.369
[sniffs]

13:07.454 --> 13:08.745
You got a problem, Rover?

13:08.830 --> 13:11.248
Go blow yourself, has-been.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.167
Ooh, easy, Beasto.

13:13.251 --> 13:17.129
Not now, darling.
I need to smash a little fuckface.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.848
Oh my God, you killed him!

13:27.932 --> 13:29.641
Calm down, folks.

13:29.726 --> 13:33.312
You can't do any real damage
to a werewolf without silver.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.774
[all gasp]

13:37.859 --> 13:39.568
The kid doesn't look so good.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.945
No worries. He's fine.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.864
Nothing to see here.
[chuckles]

13:43.948 --> 13:46.742
- Oh, silver-- not the silver.
- Back to your drinks.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.620
- Oh, Beasto!
- Hey, bumper pool.

13:49.704 --> 13:50.662
I'm next!

13:50.714 --> 13:55.542
[laughing]

13:55.627 --> 13:58.045
[groans]

13:58.129 --> 14:00.047
[farts, plops]
Oh, yeah.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.216
- Mmm.
- [toilet flushes]

14:02.300 --> 14:05.010
Women,
women everywhere,

14:05.094 --> 14:07.471
but none of them
bear the mark.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.307
My army of video voyeur bats
are everywhere,

14:10.391 --> 14:11.683
and I can spy on them all!

14:11.768 --> 14:14.228
I can see them in their showers,

14:14.312 --> 14:17.564
in their boudoirs,
even on the can.

14:17.649 --> 14:21.026
[laughing]

14:21.110 --> 14:25.030
Where are you,
my future queen of evil?

14:25.114 --> 14:27.616
Ah, look who is in the paper!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.868
Give me that,
you silly noodle-ass!

14:29.953 --> 14:32.204
Steve Wachowski?

14:32.288 --> 14:35.123
How many times do I have to
tell them it's Dr. Satan?

14:35.208 --> 14:38.794
Dr. Satan!
Dr. Satan!

14:38.878 --> 14:41.463
Steve Wachowski is no more.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.049
There there.
Who's the big man?

14:44.133 --> 14:45.634
I told them.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.844
I- I- I told the editors.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.264
I even legally changed my name.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.641
It's not you, it's them.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.060
I am evil, aren't I, Otto?

14:55.144 --> 14:58.438
- Really really scary?
- Yes yes.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.482
We all tremble
at your very name.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.902
- You do?
- And by midnight tonight

15:03.987 --> 15:06.071
so will the rest
of the world.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.698
Do tell, Otto.

15:07.782 --> 15:11.785
Tell me again how I will gain
all the sudsy powers of hell!

15:11.869 --> 15:13.620
Oh God, here we go again.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.498
Now pay attention,
because this is serious shit.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.669
<i># Find the woman with
the devil's mark #</i>

15:20.753 --> 15:22.170
<i># On her backside #</i>

15:22.255 --> 15:24.339

the Number of the Beast

oh yeah!

15:26.926 --> 15:29.386
<i># Bring her back here
for a meatpole ride #</i>

15:29.470 --> 15:32.014
"Here" is an adverb of location
referring to this castle.

15:32.098 --> 15:35.809
"Meatpole" is an adjective
describing the kind of ride.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.145
<i># Make her your unholy bride #</i>

15:38.229 --> 15:41.064
Marriage is a contractual union
generally recognized by society,

religion, and/or government.
In other words, legalized fucking!

15:44.360 --> 15:46.903

major ass, buster!

16:19.520 --> 16:21.521
Hurry, Otto, to the joystick!

16:23.858 --> 16:27.861
Ladies and gentlemen, the
Haunted Palace is proud to present--

16:33.076 --> 16:35.285
Miss Velvet von Black.

Oh oh oh, is that it, Otto?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.640
The mark-- I think I see the mark.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.393
I think that mark could be
due to G-string chafing.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.854
Otto, you must fetch her for me.

18:25.938 --> 18:30.192
That could be the mark
of my unholy bride!

18:30.276 --> 18:33.612
Just when I've almost
perfected my soufflé.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.782
Listen, you, you wouldn't
even be able to say soufflé

18:36.866 --> 18:39.201
if I hadn't put that smart screw
in your head.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.912
I can always take it out,
you know,

18:41.996 --> 18:44.206
send you back to the jungle.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.626
You remember the
jungle, don't you?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.961
[screeching]

18:52.882 --> 18:55.592
Not the jungle!
There's no cable in the jungle!

18:55.676 --> 18:58.887
Are we on the same page,
monkey?

18:58.971 --> 19:01.765
Yes yes, master, yes.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.768

Ooh! Ooh! Ahh! Ahh!

19:18.491 --> 19:21.326
It's hot out.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.121
Tomorrow's
gonna be even hotter,

19:25.206 --> 19:26.915
they say.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.709
Yes, hot weather
happens in the summer.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.801
See the game last night?

19:37.885 --> 19:41.763
A real white-knuckler.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.182
That Puerto Rican kid

19:44.267 --> 19:46.810
can really hit.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.698
Okay, then.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.032
Here we go. See ya.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.909

- Ah, finally.

20:02.994 --> 20:05.078
Ooh! Ooh! Ahh! Ahh!

20:08.040 --> 20:10.709
I think I left a nickel onstage.

20:10.793 --> 20:14.796
Consider it my donation
to the Sad-Ass Ho Club.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.506
Ay! What did she say?

20:16.591 --> 20:18.842
I said "sad ho,"

20:18.926 --> 20:20.552
you sad-ass deaf ho.

Funny!

Goddamn wedgies
up in my pussy and shit.

20:36.193 --> 20:39.154
Excuse me, but I didn't see no sign
saying "dumb-ass ape wanted."

20:39.238 --> 20:40.989
How charming.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.992
All right. Here we go.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.328
Keep it simple.
No fancy stuff needed.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.622
After all, she's only a stripper.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.457
You're a world-famous
man of action.

20:50.541 --> 20:51.917
No need to be nervous.

20:52.001 --> 20:55.587
Hello, Miss von Black?

20:55.671 --> 20:57.005
Otto:
Come on, get in there.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.007
[both struggling]

20:59.091 --> 21:01.343
Excuse me?
Didn't catch that.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.595
- [struggling]
- Otto: Come come come!

21:03.679 --> 21:06.014
Come in? I don't mind if I do.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.017
I hope you're not decent!

21:11.062 --> 21:12.145
Yowza!

21:12.229 --> 21:14.606
Hey, should I leave or join in?

21:18.110 --> 21:19.819
I'm just gonna go.

21:19.904 --> 21:23.907
Come on, Beasto.
Flowers? Beer hat?

21:23.991 --> 21:27.035
Stop thinking with your brain
and start thinking with your c--

21:27.119 --> 21:29.537
[Velvet screams]
Do I look like a wheelbarrow?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.039
Get your hands off me!

21:31.123 --> 21:32.123
Did you say something?

21:32.208 --> 21:33.500
Negative.

21:33.584 --> 21:36.127
Velvet: Hello, will somebody get
a monkey off a bitch?

21:38.130 --> 21:43.093
Take your stinking paws
off her, you damn dirty ape!

21:43.177 --> 21:46.346
Now that's a little derivative,
don't you think?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.274
That is one kinky broad.

22:03.155 --> 22:07.075
Hello, am I in for some
hot monkey love? Hmm? Is that it?

22:07.159 --> 22:10.078
Would you keep quiet? This is
humiliating enough.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.081
What would Penelope say if she
knew I was with someone like you?

22:13.165 --> 22:14.457
Be-atch, your shit should be honored.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.085
I bet if I save Velvet
from that screwy ape

22:17.169 --> 22:19.170
- she'll love me long time.
- [moaning]

22:19.255 --> 22:21.506
But my order of hot wings
is almost up,

22:21.590 --> 22:24.092
and I do love the hot wings.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.469
Draping my ass over your
hairy-ass fucking shoulders

22:26.554 --> 22:28.388
like I was a mink-ass stole and shit.

22:28.472 --> 22:32.100
- Mink stole? More like a stanky mole.
- Motherfucker!

22:32.184 --> 22:33.601
If you want to scratch this here,

22:33.686 --> 22:35.103
you better watch
your ass mouth!

22:35.187 --> 22:37.731
Oh, but she does
have an amazing ass.

22:37.815 --> 22:40.108
And those jumbo jiggly-wigglies!

22:40.192 --> 22:41.693
- [moaning]
- The only thing that comes close

22:41.777 --> 22:43.653
is the bleu cheese
they give you with the wings.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.113
You see, the wings are spicy,

22:45.197 --> 22:47.991
and the bleu cheese
cools them off just so.

22:48.075 --> 22:51.202
- [farts]
- Madam, you repulse me.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.540
Hey, monkey, where's
your organ grinder?

22:55.624 --> 22:58.126
- [laughs]
- I find that very hurtful.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.670
Oh, boo hoo.
You know what else is hurtful?

23:00.755 --> 23:03.006
Your thumb all up in my ass.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.008
My thumb is not in your ass!

23:05.092 --> 23:07.469
Well, why not?
What are you, queer?

23:07.553 --> 23:11.765
- [clock ticking]

23:14.185 --> 23:15.143

23:15.227 --> 23:17.979
Aw! I'll save the day.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.608
Celebrity coming through.

23:21.692 --> 23:23.109
Out of the way, lard-ass.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.779
Grab my car, pronto.
I'm in a hurry.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.656
Hey, get to the back
of the fucking line!

23:28.741 --> 23:31.785
People, people,
I only have so many headshots.

23:31.869 --> 23:35.163
Motherfucker,
I don't want this!

23:35.247 --> 23:38.583
Fine. Here's a free copy
of my new CD, "Beasto Crankies."

23:38.667 --> 23:40.543
It's a full 40 minutes
of phony phone calls.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.837
Hi, I'm calling from the bank.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.672
Woman:
Beasto, nigga, I know it's you!

23:44.757 --> 23:48.218
No, it's not Beasto.
I'm calling from the bank.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.804
Beasto, you hear me?

23:50.888 --> 23:52.514
Stop calling my ass.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.182
- I have some--
- Beasto--

23:54.266 --> 23:56.768

23:56.852 --> 23:58.728
[laughing]

24:00.022 --> 24:02.190
Now I'm off to see Suzi X.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.025
What a dickhead!

24:04.110 --> 24:05.568

24:25.798 --> 24:29.217
# She turns left
and some don't make it #

24:29.301 --> 24:33.138
# Zombie Nazis
fucking with my day now #

24:33.222 --> 24:36.391
# Here they come,
time to put on lipstick #

24:36.475 --> 24:38.726
# That's not safe

24:38.811 --> 24:40.603
# And here comes a train #

24:40.688 --> 24:44.315
# Sweet bleeding Christ,

35:41.848 --> 35:45.309
Dr. Satan, that is the
barrel-chested luchador

35:45.393 --> 35:47.853
that saw me kidnap
Miss von Black!

35:47.938 --> 35:50.773
So? The graveyard is
crammed with security.

35:50.857 --> 35:51.941
What's the big stinkeroo?

35:52.025 --> 35:55.236
[blows]
Ooh, pretty.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.077
- I'm not yelling at you!
- [high-pitched voice on phone]

36:03.161 --> 36:04.829
I'm not-- I'm not yelling at you.

36:04.913 --> 36:08.999
I'm just saying I deserve
to be a star.

36:10.669 --> 36:11.919
Well, I am-- I know I'm a star,

36:12.003 --> 36:13.629
but I want to be a
bigger fucking star.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.339
[roars]

36:15.423 --> 36:17.091
[high-pitched voice on phone]

36:17.175 --> 36:19.260
Um, I gotta go.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.636
Listen to me, tootsie.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.556
Ain't no dame ever gonna
make me turn pigeon, you hear?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.850
I've been kicked around by the best!

36:25.934 --> 36:28.936
Joey the Roach, Frankie the Mug,
Jimmy the Cracker--

36:29.020 --> 36:31.105
All right, you little worm,
you got until I count to three

36:31.189 --> 36:33.691
to tell me who that smelly ape
with the screw in his noggin

36:33.775 --> 36:36.902
is working for or I'm gonna
blow your little friggin' worm head

36:36.987 --> 36:38.946
- into a million pieces!
- Aw, blow me!

36:39.030 --> 36:40.531
- Uno...
- "F" you!

36:40.615 --> 36:43.242
- ...dos...
- Bet you can't even count to three.

36:43.326 --> 36:46.036
...and three--
I mean tres!

36:46.121 --> 36:49.164
Go ahead, blondie.
I don't want to live, you hear me?

36:49.249 --> 36:51.166
I don't want to live!

36:52.210 --> 36:54.920
Ah, fine. Dr. Satan.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.756
[gun blasts]
Murray, we've got a name, an address.

36:57.841 --> 36:58.966
Let's move, Tin Man!

36:59.050 --> 37:01.552
Thanks, fellas.
Nice ass kicking!

37:01.636 --> 37:02.970
Ta-ta!

37:03.054 --> 37:05.639
[roars]

37:05.724 --> 37:07.975
[grunts, groans]

37:08.059 --> 37:11.145
You picked the wrong guy
on the wrong night.

37:11.229 --> 37:16.525
I just lost another goddamn pilot
to that punk from "Malcolm in the Middle"!

37:16.610 --> 37:18.694
[grunts]
You like that?

37:18.778 --> 37:22.823
This is the result of several pushups
and that new ab thingy.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.992
It looks kind of shitty
but it really works.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.911
Ow, my ball joint!

37:26.995 --> 37:28.329

37:28.413 --> 37:29.955
Listen, ass pile,

37:30.040 --> 37:33.125

37:33.209 --> 37:36.003
No, you get out of my friggin' face!

37:36.087 --> 37:38.422
Out of the way, Sally.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.132
No siree, Barbara!

37:40.216 --> 37:44.303
Look, Mary,
I'm an A-list celebrity.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.388
I don't have time for this shit!

37:46.473 --> 37:49.016
Oh, yeah? Well, you're
also on private property,

Yello?

37:54.314 --> 37:55.397
Who loves you, baby?

37:55.482 --> 37:57.983
Dig it-- I got the lowdown
on the hoedown.

37:58.068 --> 38:00.527
Yeah, the ape works for
some cat called Dr. Satan,

38:00.612 --> 38:02.071
and he's trying to take
over the world.

38:02.155 --> 38:04.031
Huh. Yeah, right!

38:04.115 --> 38:07.284
Dr. Satan? Holy schnikeys!

38:07.369 --> 38:10.329
What would that crazy fruit ball
want with my lady?

38:10.413 --> 38:12.164
Did you say "your lady"?
[smacks]

38:12.248 --> 38:13.874
I knew this was about pussy!

38:15.835 --> 38:18.212
Cell phone people are so rude!

38:18.296 --> 38:20.255
Beasto, are you all right?
Are you okay?

38:20.340 --> 38:23.217
Fred Savage, is that you?

38:26.137 --> 38:29.056
Murray, I can dig a scene, and
this one is about to swing mondo.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.059
Beasto's hit the ultraskids and
I ain't a dame to take it on the arches

do this any more than you do.

Now why'd you stop?
I'm the one who tells you when.

41:53.052 --> 41:55.262

I'm busy.

Line, please.

- Oh, right.

Why? Why? Why?

Why? Why?

43:06.793 --> 43:09.086
I can't believe you're here.
My idol,

43:09.170 --> 43:12.339
locked in chains like
a towelhead at Guantanamo.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.759
Yeah, well, this is
a temporary setback, see?

43:15.843 --> 43:18.095
You remember when
I was pitted against

43:18.179 --> 43:20.347
the Raging Earth's Crust
at the Razzledome?

43:20.431 --> 43:21.640
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.558
He was squeezing my head

43:23.643 --> 43:24.977
- like I was a tit--
- Do you mind?

43:25.061 --> 43:28.355
I'm trying to formulate
an exciting plan of action.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.357
Then he yanked my balls off.

43:30.441 --> 43:33.360
That's great.
Your family must be very proud.

43:33.444 --> 43:35.988
I bet they gave you a party cake
and everything.

43:36.072 --> 43:38.865
Oh, no. Can't have any cake.
I'm a diabetic.

43:38.950 --> 43:42.369
But I did get a new set of
pendulous balls grafted on.

43:42.453 --> 43:43.996
- See?
- Hmm.

43:44.080 --> 43:47.332
Could this get any more repulsive?

43:47.417 --> 43:51.003
Oh, sweet buns--
firm, yet squishy.

43:51.087 --> 43:52.462
Oh, I love 'em.

43:52.547 --> 43:56.008

43:56.092 --> 43:57.968

44:00.179 --> 44:01.513
I dig the new cycle, Murray.

44:01.597 --> 44:04.641
But if I didn't know better,
I'd say the design was a bit,

44:04.726 --> 44:07.394
shall we say, kinky.

44:07.478 --> 44:11.398
Kinky? Um, uh, no,
it was, uh-- I mean--

44:11.482 --> 44:13.650
I meticulously calculated
the wind velocity

44:13.735 --> 44:16.111
and that was the most
aerodynamically sound...

44:16.195 --> 44:17.404
Time to change, Murray.

44:17.488 --> 44:20.407
If somebody caught me wearing the
same outfit in two different adventures,

44:20.491 --> 44:23.785
I think it would
simpwy bwake my wittle heart.

44:23.870 --> 44:25.412
Oh, I understand
how the heart can ache--

44:25.496 --> 44:28.123
sometimes achy-break.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.916
Suzi, oh, please--

44:30.001 --> 44:32.461
Wow, Murray, you're a riot.

44:32.545 --> 44:35.505
Let me tell you-- count yourself
lucky you don't have a heart.

44:35.590 --> 44:38.675
You never have to feel the rush
of hot blood racing through your veins,

44:38.760 --> 44:40.427
pumping life into vital organs,

44:51.022 --> 44:52.230

- Cool it, hot stuff.

44:52.315 --> 44:54.816

45:30.144 --> 45:32.813
Take Deirdre.
We met in pre-med.

45:32.897 --> 45:35.023
Oh, how I adored her.

45:35.108 --> 45:36.525
Oh, she was beneath you, sir--

45:36.609 --> 45:39.486
and beneath every man on the
Manchester United Football Club.

45:39.570 --> 45:42.364
Oh? And what would
you know about it, monkey?

45:42.448 --> 45:44.574
Anyway, she was boring.

45:44.659 --> 45:48.662
Ah, my second marriage, to Lilith,
was a debaucherous downward spiral.

45:48.746 --> 45:49.704
Mmm!

45:49.789 --> 45:52.082
Ah, Shirley.
She was cute--

45:52.166 --> 45:54.626
couple of father issues, though.
Hmm.

45:54.710 --> 45:56.294
Oh, Maria.

45:56.379 --> 45:58.505
Philosophical differences.
Mmm.

45:58.589 --> 46:01.174
Impala-- she wouldn't
let me get too close to her.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.427
Sarah--
she ran hot and cold.

46:03.511 --> 46:05.429
Sex was mechanical!

46:05.513 --> 46:06.513
Too clingy.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.848
Too bossy.
Slurped her soup.

46:07.932 --> 46:09.015
Oh! My dry cleaning.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.308
Nope.
Wrong.

46:10.393 --> 46:11.810
No no no no no.

46:11.894 --> 46:12.853
Nose!

46:12.937 --> 46:15.522
Ball busters on parade, brother!

46:15.606 --> 46:17.691
22 wives, Otto,

46:17.775 --> 46:20.068
all of them abysmal catastrophes!

46:20.153 --> 46:21.736
A total waste of time!

46:21.821 --> 46:24.865
Oh, but how I love the ladies!

46:24.949 --> 46:27.159
Nothing will stop me now!

46:27.243 --> 46:29.953
Get me Velvet von Black!

46:30.003 --> 46:31.204
[squeaking]

46:31.289 --> 46:33.540
- What was that?
- I'll tell you what it was,

46:33.624 --> 46:36.501
if you ask me. But quite honestly,
you've been difficult to talk to.

46:36.586 --> 46:40.005
Oh, shit.
I think that was a rat.

46:40.089 --> 46:43.925
Well, then-- there are only two things
in this world that I'm afraid of:

46:44.010 --> 46:47.387
my Uncle Carl in a thong,
and rats!

46:47.472 --> 46:49.139
Well, I got bad news for you, son.

46:49.223 --> 46:50.348
And worse news.

46:50.433 --> 46:52.517
Uh, what's the bad news?

46:52.602 --> 46:55.687
Hey, Beasto, you want to
play "My Bad Little Pony"?

46:55.771 --> 46:57.606
Uncle Carl!

46:57.690 --> 47:00.484
Jesus, Mary, and Seacrest!

47:00.568 --> 47:01.735
What's the worse news?

47:01.819 --> 47:03.153
Hey, check this out.

47:05.656 --> 47:06.656
B- b-b-b-b-b!

47:11.245 --> 47:12.579
[farts]
Oh, moist.

47:12.663 --> 47:13.997
That's a new one.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.582
People'd pay money to see that.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.293
I can't take it.
I'm not supposed to die like this.

47:18.377 --> 47:20.003
I'm a celebrity, damn it!

47:20.087 --> 47:24.674
Wachowski, get ready for
the wedgie of your life!

47:29.680 --> 47:31.598
Whoo! Attaboy!

47:42.485 --> 47:46.029
[cackling]

47:46.113 --> 47:49.574
My pretty Miss X.
[laughs]

47:49.659 --> 47:52.619
You thought you'd seen
the last of us, didn't you?

47:52.703 --> 47:54.913
Yeah, well, I was kinda hoping,
you know.

47:54.997 --> 47:57.624
I did change my outfit and all.
Do you like it?

47:57.708 --> 48:00.418
[wolf whistles]

48:00.503 --> 48:02.128
Zombies:
It looks like it was painted on.

48:02.213 --> 48:06.925
- She's much hotter than Eva Braun.
- Come to Papa!

48:07.009 --> 48:09.386
- Now you're cooking with gas!
- [sizzles]

48:09.470 --> 48:10.971
Ooh, sexy Mama!

48:11.055 --> 48:12.639
Silence, Grossberger!

48:12.723 --> 48:15.475
Very clever, Miss X,

48:15.560 --> 48:20.355
but you are not familiar
with the Nazi Curse, are you?

48:20.439 --> 48:23.066
Hmm, which one?
Let me see.

48:23.150 --> 48:24.734
There's "Fuck Nazis,"

48:24.819 --> 48:25.986
"God Damn Nazis,"

48:26.070 --> 48:27.112
"Nazi Assholes,"

48:27.196 --> 48:28.280
"Nazi Pricks,"

48:28.364 --> 48:29.447
"Nazi Douche Bags,"

48:29.532 --> 48:30.657
"Nazi Jerk Offs"--

48:30.741 --> 48:32.659
the list just goes on and on.

48:32.743 --> 48:36.121
Ha ha ha.
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

48:36.205 --> 48:39.666
No, my pretty.
The Nazi Curse proclaims

48:39.750 --> 48:42.919
that the one who vanquishes
the soul of the Fuhrer

48:43.004 --> 48:45.880
will suffer the second coming
of the Third Reich!

48:45.965 --> 48:49.175
Arise, soldiers of the Third Reich!

48:49.260 --> 48:51.761
[cackling]

48:54.765 --> 48:56.683
Nobody's laughing now!

48:56.767 --> 48:59.102
Well, I am, but it's
all about context, you see.

48:59.186 --> 49:00.353
[laughs]

49:00.438 --> 49:01.896
Correct me if I'm wrong here,

49:01.981 --> 49:03.982
but wouldn't the second coming
of the Third Reich

49:04.066 --> 49:06.318
actually be the first coming
of the Fourth Reich?

49:07.778 --> 49:09.821
What did you say?

49:09.905 --> 49:11.698
Since this is the new one
after number three,

49:11.782 --> 49:14.701
wouldn't this technically
be number four, dipshit?

49:14.785 --> 49:18.330
That's right. You go, girl.
You know what you're talking about.

49:19.790 --> 49:21.207
Technically she is correct.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.917
Wilhelm, would you do me a favor?

49:23.002 --> 49:24.711
- Yeah.
- Shut up!

49:24.795 --> 49:26.254
- Aw, forget it.
- [zombies grumbling]

49:26.339 --> 49:28.715
Wait wait, my brothers.
No no no!

49:28.799 --> 49:30.300
Do over! Do over!

49:30.384 --> 49:34.304
Arise, soldiers of either the
Fourth or the Third Reich,

49:34.388 --> 49:37.140
you know, depending on
how you choose to count it.

49:37.224 --> 49:38.683
[laughs maniacally]

49:38.768 --> 49:41.519
Who's your daddy now?
That's right. Me!

49:41.604 --> 49:44.564
Murray, prepare
for Ass Kicking 101!

49:44.649 --> 49:45.815
Let's get it done!

49:49.070 --> 49:51.738
So, Dr. Satan, huh?
What the fuck?

49:51.822 --> 49:53.740
You a doctor, like a PhD and shit?

49:53.824 --> 49:58.536
Ah, Velvet, you are the most
delightful and bewitching woman

49:58.621 --> 50:00.914
I have ever met.
[coughs]

50:00.998 --> 50:02.624
That's 'cause I'm a fuckin' lady.
Mmm.

50:03.626 --> 50:06.961
Hmm. I don't want
to seem too forward, Velvet,

50:07.046 --> 50:09.714
but the truth is I've grown
quite smitten with you.

50:09.799 --> 50:10.757
Oh, God.

50:10.841 --> 50:12.759
[burps]
Yeah, me too.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.761
You got some nice digs, though.
I ain't gonna front.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.930
When Tananeesha and
Roqwana come through,

50:17.014 --> 50:18.598
ooh, it's gonna be on!

50:18.683 --> 50:19.766
Them bitches gonna be jealous.

50:19.850 --> 50:21.976
Velvet, I'm going to cut to the chase.

50:22.061 --> 50:24.938
50% of everything
you see here is yours

50:25.022 --> 50:27.357
if you will be my bride.

50:27.441 --> 50:30.402
Oh, Satan, you're
the motherfuckin' man!

50:30.486 --> 50:32.696
And now, my dear--

50:32.780 --> 50:35.532
[sawing]

50:35.616 --> 50:37.117
And now--

50:37.201 --> 50:39.160
- [sawing]
- Otto!

50:39.245 --> 50:40.370
Where the fuck is the ring?

50:40.454 --> 50:44.290
How fast do you think I can
saw the finger off a corpse?

50:46.043 --> 50:49.796
Hmm, so, this is awkward.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.631
- [chainsaw]
- Mmm-hmm.

50:51.716 --> 50:53.550
[clears throat]

50:58.097 --> 50:59.222
[bone snaps]

51:01.350 --> 51:04.227
Be my number 23.

51:04.311 --> 51:05.812
Da-a-amn!

51:05.896 --> 51:07.605
Now that's what
I'm talking about!

51:07.690 --> 51:08.898
That shit's tight!

51:08.983 --> 51:10.692
Alright, I'm down.

51:10.776 --> 51:11.818
Let's turn this mother out!

51:11.902 --> 51:13.820
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

51:13.904 --> 51:18.950
We are gonna have
the best Polish wedding ever!

51:19.034 --> 51:21.828
[laughs maniacally]

51:21.907 --> 51:24.831
You gotta understand--
it's not an exercise program,

51:24.915 --> 51:26.166
it's a lifestyle.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.042
Look at me. I don't eat carbs.

51:28.127 --> 51:29.836
I don't eat 'em after 8:00.

51:29.920 --> 51:30.920
I just don't do it.

51:34.425 --> 51:35.425
[groans]

51:43.434 --> 51:45.602
[growls]

51:45.686 --> 51:47.645
You know what we are,
don't you?

51:47.730 --> 51:48.855
I'll tell ya--
we're doomed!

51:48.939 --> 51:51.858
Not so fast, my big-balled friend.

51:51.942 --> 51:55.695
I didn't come this far to go down
like a Filipino transvestite

51:55.780 --> 51:56.905
during Fleet Week.

52:04.038 --> 52:06.164
Uh, music.

52:08.334 --> 52:11.336

- [speaking Japanese]

52:31.982 --> 52:34.192
Whoo, that was a lot of fun.

52:34.276 --> 52:36.653
I haven't kicked ass
like that in a long time.

52:36.737 --> 52:38.488
Wait, I hear something.

52:38.572 --> 52:41.866
Is that Bodislav Bodinsky
the polka king?

52:41.951 --> 52:43.493
Outrageous!

52:43.577 --> 52:45.036
Let's go!

52:45.120 --> 52:48.540
Oh, sure, use a man's balls
to beat the hell out of something

52:48.624 --> 52:49.749
and then don't wait for him!

I was in such a good mood.

52:59.385 --> 53:01.886
Mind if I borrow these
for a moment?

53:05.015 --> 53:06.266
Time to take over, big boy.

53:06.350 --> 53:07.684
I'm going in.

53:07.768 --> 53:10.019
Going in?
Fucking awesome!

53:11.981 --> 53:16.401
Damn iit, Otto, this is my special day
and those two are going to ruin it!

53:16.485 --> 53:17.819
Now, hold still.

53:17.903 --> 53:20.613
I don't think you're
taking this problem seriously.

53:20.698 --> 53:23.616
Not taking it seriously?

53:23.701 --> 53:27.495
Whose idea was it for the giant
cascading waterfall of shrimp, hmm?

53:29.039 --> 53:29.998
You.

53:30.082 --> 53:32.959
And who was going
to surprise you

53:33.043 --> 53:35.086
with a life-size ice sculpture

53:35.170 --> 53:39.299
of His Supreme Evilness
Dr. Satan in all his glory?

53:39.383 --> 53:41.968
- You didn't.
- I did.

53:45.472 --> 53:46.931
Well, that's fine and dandy,

53:47.016 --> 53:48.600
but did you ever stop
for one second

53:48.684 --> 53:51.519
and think that if you weren't
acting like a giant Froot Loop

53:51.604 --> 53:53.938
parading around
knee-deep in doilies,

53:54.023 --> 53:55.982
then you would have noticed
that there were two superheroes

53:56.066 --> 53:58.776
about to throw a
goddamn monkey wrench

53:58.861 --> 54:02.906
in my master plan,
you stupid monkey!

- Fuck you and your shrimp boat.

54:05.701 --> 54:07.076
I'm doing this my way.

54:08.078 --> 54:09.996
Oh! I meant to do that.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.248
Mark my words, Steven.

54:12.333 --> 54:15.126
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Oh!

54:15.210 --> 54:18.046
[groans]

54:21.091 --> 54:23.801
Don't all try and crowd in
on this one.

54:23.886 --> 54:26.012
There'll be another shuttle
along shortly.

54:26.096 --> 54:28.890
Hmm. Perfect.

for everyone.

54:32.019 --> 54:33.394
- Hi.
- Oh!

54:33.479 --> 54:36.105
So, are you with the bride
or the boobs-- the groom?

54:36.190 --> 54:38.191
I'm with the groom, honeycakes.

54:38.275 --> 54:39.359
Slut!

54:39.443 --> 54:42.028
Please, Mildred,
don't make a scene.

54:42.112 --> 54:43.529
She seems nice.

54:48.327 --> 54:50.828
So, Latrizza, I'm just saying,

54:50.913 --> 54:52.789
he's a crazy, fugly sonofabitch,

54:52.873 --> 54:55.041
but I'm gonna get all that money,
you know what I'm saying? Half!

54:56.126 --> 54:58.670
Half, bitch, you
understand that shit? Half!

55:00.631 --> 55:03.341
Darling, are you almost ready?
The guests are arriving.

55:03.425 --> 55:05.051
Oh, I know you ain't talking to me.

55:05.135 --> 55:06.886
Do I look motherfucking ready?

55:06.971 --> 55:09.347
Yeah, you needs to
wait your ass outside. Shit!

55:09.431 --> 55:12.517
No, I just thought that- that--

55:12.601 --> 55:13.685
Thought what?

55:13.769 --> 55:14.852
- Um--
- What?

55:14.937 --> 55:16.396
- Uh, um--
- What?

55:16.480 --> 55:20.066
Yo, spit that motherfucking shit
out or get out.

55:20.150 --> 55:21.526
Please, sweetie pants,

55:21.610 --> 55:23.653
your tone is distressing!

55:23.737 --> 55:27.657
Special day.
Shrimp boat.

55:27.741 --> 55:30.076
I'll be ready when I'm goddamn ready.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.369
Yo, is this the way you gonna be,

55:31.453 --> 55:32.996
acting like a fool and shit?

55:34.331 --> 55:35.999
Act a fool?

55:36.083 --> 55:38.167
No, cupcake.

55:40.879 --> 55:43.506
I'm gonna act like this!

[Theme from "The Godfather" plays]

you'd like to say, Otto?

55:54.518 --> 55:56.811
I'll save my comments for later, sir.

55:56.895 --> 55:59.272
Then get this frozen
bitch to the altar!

56:00.649 --> 56:03.109

these pierogies taste like shit!

Here, you try them.

56:05.863 --> 56:08.114
Time to blend in and mingle.

Look at those ass flaps!
