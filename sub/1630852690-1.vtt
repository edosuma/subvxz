00:13.013 --> 00:15.223
<i>male narrator:</i>
<i>In the middle of America,</i>

00:15.265 --> 00:17.308
<i>where the temperatures</i>
<i>are cold,</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:19.436
<i>the winter ice is solid,</i>

00:19.477 --> 00:22.063
<i>and the dreams are pure,</i>

00:22.105 --> 00:24.065
<i>these four dudes--</i>

00:24.107 --> 00:26.484
<i>yep, these average Joe's--</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:30.113
<i>are chasing a little more</i>
<i>Olympic glory.</i>

00:30.155 --> 00:33.158
<i>What's that? "They don't seem</i>
<i>the type," you say.</i>

00:33.199 --> 00:35.410
Well, you must not know
the story

00:35.452 --> 00:37.871
of how far
they've already traveled

00:37.912 --> 00:41.624
and how badly they want
to do it all over again.

00:41.666 --> 00:42.459
Whoo!

00:42.500 --> 00:44.919
<i>And that is it:</i>

00:44.961 --> 00:46.671
<i>curling gold.</i>

00:46.713 --> 00:49.215
<i>narrator: Four years ago,</i>
<i>at the last Olympics,</i>

00:49.257 --> 00:54.679
<i>the United States men's</i>
<i>curling team won a gold medal,</i>

00:54.721 --> 00:56.556
<i>which was kind of a big deal,</i>

00:56.598 --> 01:01.144
<i>because, well, did I mention</i>
<i>it was a gold medal?</i>

01:01.186 --> 01:03.355
<i>But also, because,</i>
<i>let's be frank,</i>

01:03.396 --> 01:08.068
<i>they don't exactly look like</i>
<i>Michael Phelps or Usain Bolt.</i>

01:08.109 --> 01:10.904
<i>Now, they're hoping</i>
<i>to go clear across</i>

01:10.945 --> 01:14.616
<i>to the other side of the world</i>
<i>to defend their title</i>

01:14.657 --> 01:17.535
<i>and make history</i>
<i>all over again.</i>

01:17.952 --> 01:19.704
<i>John, the team captain,</i>

01:19.746 --> 01:22.582
<i>a family man who's been</i>
<i>competing at the Olympics</i>

01:22.624 --> 01:24.793
<i>for nearly half his life.</i>

01:24.834 --> 01:30.131
<i>Matt, gloriously shaggy</i>
<i>and deadly with the stone.</i>

01:30.173 --> 01:32.634
<i>The other John, quiet fellow,</i>

01:32.676 --> 01:35.303
<i>but a nice way about him,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

01:35.345 --> 01:37.639
<i>And last, the new guy Chris,</i>

01:37.681 --> 01:41.393
<i>who knows gold is</i>
<i>the only acceptable outcome.</i>

01:41.434 --> 01:43.269
<i>Perfect timing,</i>
<i>wouldn't you say?</i>

01:43.311 --> 01:45.647
Hard! Hard!

01:46.648 --> 01:49.651
<i>narrator: This is the story</i>
<i>of a team of a team of guys</i>

01:49.693 --> 01:52.362
<i>who might look like</i>
<i>your dad or your brother,</i>

01:52.404 --> 01:54.614
<i>aiming to accomplish something</i>

01:54.656 --> 01:57.867
<i>I'll bet your dad or brother</i>
<i>have never even tried:</i>

01:57.909 --> 02:02.205
<i>defending a gold medal</i>
<i>at the Olympics.</i>

02:02.247 --> 02:04.874
<i>The road there won't be easy.</i>

02:04.916 --> 02:07.502
<i>The competition is as fierce</i>
<i>as it's ever been</i>

02:07.544 --> 02:09.254
<i>in their sport.</i>

02:09.295 --> 02:11.339
<i>But only</i>
<i>the hardest challenges</i>

02:11.381 --> 02:13.675
<i>can turn men into giants,</i>

02:13.717 --> 02:16.344
<i>competitors into champions,</i>

02:16.386 --> 02:18.221
<i>and guys who look like this</i>

02:18.263 --> 02:21.099
<i>into American rock stars.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:23.852
<i>So get comfortable</i>
<i>and keep your eyes open,</i>

02:23.893 --> 02:26.855
<i>because one of the greatest</i>
<i>sports stories ever told</i>

02:26.896 --> 02:30.316
<i>is about to slide</i>
<i>towards you real fast.</i>

02:54.341 --> 02:57.135
<i>- Whoo!</i>

02:57.177 --> 03:00.597
<i>- That was, like,</i>
<i>cracking under foot.</i>

03:01.931 --> 03:04.392
If I roll an ankle,

03:04.434 --> 03:06.561
I directly blame you.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.730
Yeah, that's fair.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.315
So where do you want to go?

03:10.357 --> 03:12.609
- I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.195
I know we're going
the right direction, though.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.364
<i>narrator: One of the most</i>
<i>irresistible things</i>

03:17.405 --> 03:18.865
<i>in the world</i>

03:18.907 --> 03:21.493
<i>is when ordinary folks</i>
<i>come together</i>

03:21.534 --> 03:24.621
<i>to do extraordinary things.</i>

03:25.789 --> 03:27.415
<i>And how about</i>
<i>we start the tale</i>

03:27.457 --> 03:29.668
<i>of their epic journey here,</i>

03:29.709 --> 03:33.004
<i>on a frozen lake</i>
<i>outside of Duluth, Minnesota,</i>

03:33.046 --> 03:36.216
<i>with the 2022 Olympic</i>
<i>Curling Trials</i>

03:36.257 --> 03:37.759
<i>nine months away,</i>

03:37.801 --> 03:39.969
<i>a timeline that</i>
<i>you'd think would mean</i>

<i>the guys of Team USA would be,</i>
<i>you know, curling today.</i>

03:44.974 --> 03:46.017
<i>But no.</i>

03:46.059 --> 03:48.103
<i>On this gorgeous day,</i>

03:48.144 --> 03:49.896
<i>they have a different plan.</i>

03:54.401 --> 03:55.985
Ooh.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.362
There she is.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.531
- A lot of ice out here still.
- That was like 14.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.616
- Again, there's cars down there.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.784
- See, I don't really
even need to fish.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.911
- I can just drink some beers.
- Yeah.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.329
- That's my favorite
part of fishing.

04:06.371 --> 04:07.539
- The beer?
- Yeah.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.915
- Yeah, that's why
I come out here.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.376
I mean, obviously,
it's not like

04:11.418 --> 04:14.379
I'm coming out to catch fish,
because I'm like 0-for-10.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.840


04:21.261 --> 04:22.887
Nah, he's coming.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.390
Give him a second
without jigging it.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.600
Don't--don't--
don't go too far down, Adam.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.893
You kind of want them
to compete.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.061
If you can get them up
to the same level,

04:30.103 --> 04:32.397
a lot of times
they get competitive.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.399
- Yeah.
- That's what he says, Matt,

04:34.441 --> 04:36.651
but I have yet to see
one even hooked.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.988
- Today is the day, Colin.
Today is the day.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.240
- Someone should
pull me one, please.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.242
- Already?
- Dude, I have--

04:44.284 --> 04:46.161
I have got a wet line.
I should have a beer in hand.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.999
Here you go, big guy.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.335
- Oh, my gosh,
that slid like a curling stone.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.086
- Really?
You're better than that.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.964
I thought for sure you had it.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.342
<i>narrator: That right there</i>

05:00.383 --> 05:02.135

<i>but he's one of the best</i>
<i>damn curlers in the world.</i>

05:14.731 --> 05:17.984
- We got this today, guys.
Today's our day.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.070
Today is our day.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.112
Oh, it is a fish.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.739
Son of a gun. All right.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.700
This one's up higher.
This one's gonna bite.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.328
I think he bit
and I just missed him.

<i>narrator: And that is</i>
<i>Chisolm, Minnesota's</i>

05:32.832 --> 05:34.167
<i>Wherever there's ice,</i>

<i>he tends to be</i>
<i>the guy in charge.</i>

05:36.753 --> 05:38.880
<i>He's the skip of the team</i>

05:38.922 --> 05:42.258

05:51.101 --> 05:53.395
- Chris might be the grumpiest
person in curling, though.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.564
- Not just in U.S. curling,
either.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.066
Like, in curling in general.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.943
- A walking,
talking curmudgeon.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.862
- Like, yeah. I'm gonna be
really bad when I'm older, man.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.239
- The lines--

06:04.280 --> 06:06.574
the phrases Chris says
more than anything else

06:06.616 --> 06:08.076
are "Do you know what I hate?"

06:08.118 --> 06:10.120
or "Do you know
what makes me mad?"

06:10.161 --> 06:12.330
or "Do you know
what grinds my hears?"

06:12.372 --> 06:14.916
- "You know what gets my goat?"
- Yeah, yeah.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.042
So much.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.777
Oh, yeah!

06:44.612 --> 06:46.448
- Anything is possible!
- Can't shut us out.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.949
It is not very big.

- No, you got a...

06:49.826 --> 06:50.910

One time!

down there.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.546
Get really close.

- Put it--put it on my line,
so I can catch one.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.632
Need longer arms.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.884

I better just put him back.
Yeah.

<i>to that legendary</i>

07:27.906 --> 07:29.866
<i>when John Shuster</i>
<i>and Matt Hamilton</i>

<i>in a place called Pyeongchang.</i>

07:41.920 --> 07:46.341
<i>- The Olympics</i>
<i>are my pinnacle of sport.</i>

07:46.383 --> 07:48.051
I mean, the Olympics--

07:48.093 --> 07:49.969
if you can't find energy
at the Olympics,

07:50.011 --> 07:52.055
good luck finding energy
anywhere as an athlete.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.309
<i>narrator:</i>
<i>Energy? Sure. Plenty.</i>

07:56.351 --> 07:57.811

<i>- It's a horrible break.</i>
<i>Look at it.</i>

08:02.691 --> 08:03.900
<i>It's going sideways.</i>

08:03.942 --> 08:05.402

<i>The U.S. and John Shuster</i>

<i>With Shuster as skip,</i>

<i>the team</i>
<i>finished last in 2010.</i>

08:23.586 --> 08:26.047
What a disaster.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.799
<i>narrator: And then in 2014,</i>

08:27.841 --> 08:30.135
<i>they finished</i>
<i>slightly better--</i>

08:30.176 --> 08:31.886
<i>second to last.</i>

08:31.928 --> 08:34.556

Jesus Christ!

<i>That was definitely</i>
<i>the low point</i>

08:38.601 --> 08:41.062
<i>in my curling journey.</i>

It was difficult to even
decide to continue playing

like that happens.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.945
But I'm not gonna quit

<i>focused on Pyeongchang.</i>

<i>He continued</i>

<i>and good thing, too,</i>

08:59.831 --> 09:01.666
<i>because the road</i>
<i>to Pyeongchang</i>

<i>would be quite a bumpy one,</i>

09:21.936 --> 09:23.396
That would have been great
mid-story, dog.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.564
He came flying up too.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.406
<i>Team lead John Landsteiner</i>

09:33.448 --> 09:35.784
<i>isn't on the lake</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

09:35.825 --> 09:39.579
<i>Though he's an integral part</i>
<i>of a team whose sport,</i>

09:39.621 --> 09:42.165
<i>come to think of it,</i>
<i>is a lot like fishing.</i>

09:42.207 --> 09:43.958
<i>You keep taking your shot,</i>

09:44.000 --> 09:45.960
<i>and you keep up hope,</i>

09:46.002 --> 09:50.715
<i>even when things</i>
<i>aren't going your way.</i>

09:50.757 --> 09:53.426
- I'm sure you have heard
about Team Reject.

09:53.468 --> 09:57.931
That was--that was our team
initially in 2015.

09:57.972 --> 10:01.309
<i>narrator:</i>
<i>Ah, yes, Team Reject,</i>

10:01.351 --> 10:04.187
<i>a moniker that was born</i>
<i>when U.S. curling</i>

10:04.229 --> 10:07.065
<i>started a new</i>
<i>High Performance Program</i>

10:07.107 --> 10:10.068
<i>after several</i>
<i>dismal Olympics showings,</i>

10:10.110 --> 10:14.280
<i>and no one from Team Shuster</i>
<i>made the cut.</i>

10:14.322 --> 10:17.325
- I think three of the four
people on our Olympic gold team

10:17.367 --> 10:18.576
tried out at the combine,

10:18.618 --> 10:22.330
and none of us
were brought into the program.

10:22.372 --> 10:26.418
Yeah, we were "rejected"
from the program.

10:26.459 --> 10:31.548
<i>So we created our own team</i>
<i>kinda the old school way.</i>

10:32.298 --> 10:34.342
- When we didn't make
the national team, I was like,

10:34.384 --> 10:35.802
well, I guess I'm gonna
have to do it on my own

10:35.844 --> 10:37.554
like I always have,
pick my own teammates,

10:37.595 --> 10:39.014
and hopefully
there's a few good ones left.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.140
I was pretty confident

10:40.181 --> 10:42.559
going into this,
like, "tryout."

10:42.600 --> 10:44.811
Then I got an email from
the High Performance Director.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.980
He's like,
"Hey, I regret to inform you

10:47.022 --> 10:49.065
that you didn't make
the team this year."

10:49.107 --> 10:51.109
And I replied
in an email saying,

10:51.151 --> 10:53.653
"Hey, I know it was
totally your choice,

10:53.695 --> 10:55.488
"and I respect your opinion,

10:55.530 --> 10:59.242
and I look forward to proving
how wrong you were."

10:59.284 --> 11:02.537
So I don't get accepted
to the HP program,

11:02.579 --> 11:04.205
so what are my next options?

11:04.247 --> 11:08.376
I'm like, well,
Shusty is obviously

11:08.418 --> 11:11.963
a three-time Olympian
at this point,

11:12.005 --> 11:13.131
and he called me and was like,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.842
"Hey, want to join
my team of rejects?"

11:17.302 --> 11:18.887
It's totally true.
He asked me if I wanted

11:18.928 --> 11:20.513
to join his team of rejects,
and we did.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.266
I really wanted
to prove these guys wrong

11:23.308 --> 11:24.642
for not picking me
in this program.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.852
It lit a fire.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.771
Instead of, like,
totally crushing me,

11:27.812 --> 11:29.439
it just lit a fire.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.067
<i>narrator:</i>
<i>And so, all fired up,</i>

11:32.108 --> 11:34.444
<i>Shuster, Hamilton,</i>
<i>and their teammates</i>

11:34.486 --> 11:37.280
<i>went up at nationals</i>

11:37.322 --> 11:39.616
<i>from the High Performance</i>
<i>Program.</i>

11:39.657 --> 11:43.286

<i>Team Reject beat 'em all.</i>

11:43.328 --> 11:45.080
<i>Then, something</i>

11:45.121 --> 11:46.956

11:46.998 --> 11:48.333

<i>John Shuster and his team</i>

11:54.464 --> 11:57.759
<i>narrator: Nobody had expected</i>
<i>them to get to Pyeongchang,</i>

11:57.801 --> 11:59.761
<i>but they'd earned their spot</i>
<i>and couldn't wait</i>

11:59.803 --> 12:02.597
<i>to prove everyone wrong again</i>
<i>when they arrived there.</i>

12:06.976 --> 12:08.311
<i>I was stoked.</i>

12:08.353 --> 12:10.105
<i>We were really excited</i>
<i>to play together.</i>

12:10.146 --> 12:11.314
<i>We get to play Korea,</i>

12:11.356 --> 12:12.774
<i>and they let me pick</i>
<i>the outfits,</i>

12:12.816 --> 12:15.068
<i>and I picked white shirts</i>
<i>with white pants,</i>

12:15.110 --> 12:16.903
which was awesome,
in my opinion.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.279
I don't care--

12:18.321 --> 12:20.240
if you thought we looked bad,
you're wrong.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.539
<i>- The opening stone thrown</i>
<i>in end number one.</i>

12:28.665 --> 12:30.000

12:30.041 --> 12:32.502
<i>by the Americans'</i>
<i>white-on-white palette,</i>

12:32.544 --> 12:34.421
<i>you might also</i>

12:34.462 --> 12:36.339

12:36.381 --> 12:39.092
<i>So how 'bout now</i>

12:39.134 --> 12:41.386
<i>In curling,</i>

12:41.428 --> 12:45.056
<i>throwing the stone</i>
<i>down the ice eight times,</i>

12:45.098 --> 12:47.851

12:47.892 --> 12:49.352
<i>After each end,</i>

12:49.394 --> 12:51.521

<i>stones,</i>

12:56.151 --> 12:58.403
<i>- It's been a good start</i>
<i>to these games.</i>

12:58.445 --> 13:00.530
<i>The United States</i>
<i>have opened up the Olympics</i>

13:00.572 --> 13:03.742

13:07.579 --> 13:11.291
<i>Team USA won their opening</i>
<i>round robin match...</i>

13:13.585 --> 13:16.296
<i>but then lost</i>

13:16.338 --> 13:18.882
<i>- John Shuster said,</i>
<i>"I'll throw it good."</i>

13:18.923 --> 13:21.009
<i>He did not.</i>

13:21.051 --> 13:22.844
<i>After week one,</i>

13:22.886 --> 13:25.263
I was a little down.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.350
<i>It's tough,</i>
<i>'cause we were setting 'em up.</i>

13:28.391 --> 13:30.769
<i>Nothing sounded good there.</i>

13:30.810 --> 13:32.062
<i>Yeah, that's frustrating.</i>

13:32.103 --> 13:33.521
Come on.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.149
- John had a couple bad misses
late in some games.

13:36.191 --> 13:39.903
And honestly, Johnny was
kind of struggling early.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.322
- It's not okay.
That's not okay.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.990
I'm sorry.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.241
<i>narrator: The skip of a team</i>

13:45.283 --> 13:47.535

14:01.841 --> 14:04.427

14:11.184 --> 14:13.395
- 2-4, you could be out
of the tournament already.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.606
Four losses might not be good
enough to make the top four.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.400
We're good?

14:18.441 --> 14:20.944
John, how frustrating a morning
has that been for you?

14:20.985 --> 14:23.029
Oh, extremely. Yeah.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.031
We--we actually
played pretty decent

14:25.073 --> 14:27.158
and had a couple,
you know, tough ends there,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.160
tough ends of ends,
where we had some stuff set up

14:29.202 --> 14:31.079
and just couldn't
finish them today.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.372
- From your own perspective--

14:32.414 --> 14:34.165
I saw you banging your brush
at one point--

14:34.207 --> 14:35.875
how frustrated were you
with your own performance?

14:35.917 --> 14:37.460
- Oh, I--I--

14:37.502 --> 14:39.087
the worst feeling in the world
is letting your team down.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.797
<i>So pretty heartbreaking</i>
<i>for me to--</i>

14:40.839 --> 14:42.173
<i>to do that to my teammates,</i>

14:42.215 --> 14:43.466
<i>'cause, you know,</i>
<i>you try to not do that.</i>

14:43.508 --> 14:45.093
<i>But that comes</i>
<i>with being a skip.</i>

14:45.135 --> 14:46.261
- Course. Thanks, John.
- Thank you.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.929
Appreciate your time.

if we're gonna continue on.

<i>I had a couple bad games</i>

<i>something negative</i>

15:31.306 --> 15:32.515
<i>was happening</i>
<i>at the Olympics again,</i>

15:32.557 --> 15:35.352
<i>because I just put</i>
<i>so much into it.</i>

15:35.393 --> 15:38.313
I walked my family

16:00.335 --> 16:01.628

amongst our family
is the exact phrase:

18:36.449 --> 18:37.742
"Everything happens
for a reason."

18:37.784 --> 18:39.953
And I have a sign
in my basement that says

18:39.994 --> 18:41.329
"Everything happens
for a reason."

18:41.371 --> 18:43.415
- No!
<i>- You just have to believe.</i>

18:44.749 --> 18:46.126
All right.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.254
<i>John Shuster is money.</i>

18:49.754 --> 18:52.173
<i>- John Shuster is</i>
<i>a different person right now.</i>

18:52.215 --> 18:55.301
<i>He's extremely confident.</i>

18:57.762 --> 18:59.139
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

18:59.180 --> 19:00.598
He might have got struck
by lightning or something.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.434
But we weren't
losing that game.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.270
<i>They like it.</i>

19:05.311 --> 19:07.272
<i>And why not?</i>

19:07.313 --> 19:09.941
<i>Belief for the Americans.</i>

19:09.983 --> 19:12.694
<i>- I was able to finally</i>
<i>let go of that emotion</i>

19:12.736 --> 19:18.616
of caring about the results
and just enjoying the process,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.827
and that's when the magic
really happened for me.

19:21.578 --> 19:24.956
<i>- Got it around the guard.</i>
<i>Got it there.</i>

19:24.998 --> 19:28.835
<i>And got the United States</i>
<i>a much-needed victory.</i>

19:30.503 --> 19:33.048
<i>In a must-win situation,</i>

19:33.089 --> 19:35.508
<i>John Shuster delivers.</i>

19:38.636 --> 19:40.221
- John, what did that mean
to you out there today,

19:40.263 --> 19:42.307
- to win that one?
- It was a huge win.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.851
You know, it meant a lot too,
'cause, um, you know,

19:44.893 --> 19:47.645
I've obviously been struggling
here for a few games.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.648
And to come out here
and get a win against,

19:50.690 --> 19:52.484
you know,
the class of the field was--

19:52.525 --> 19:55.737
was very big for--
for both our team and--

19:55.779 --> 19:58.323
and our team's momentum
here going forward.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.034
<i>It didn't feel like the end.</i>
<i>It really just felt like--</i>

20:01.076 --> 20:02.952
like we were just
getting onto something,

20:02.994 --> 20:04.913
and it was the beginning
of something.

20:05.914 --> 20:09.417
<i>- Now, for Team USA to stay in</i>
<i>medal contention,</i>

20:09.459 --> 20:12.295
<i>it needs to do it</i>
<i>again and again.</i>

20:12.337 --> 20:14.881
<i>- You knew if you lost one,</i>
<i>you were out.</i>

20:14.923 --> 20:17.550
But as a team,
we had talked about

20:17.592 --> 20:19.511
just making sure we go out
and have fun.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.307
Yeah, Johnny!

20:24.349 --> 20:28.395
<i>- It's been a curling clinic</i>
<i>for John Shuster.</i>

20:29.688 --> 20:30.855
<i>We were having fun.</i>

20:30.897 --> 20:32.565
<i>I was giving Johnny</i>
<i>some fist pumps</i>

20:32.607 --> 20:34.526
<i>after made shots and stuff.</i>

20:34.567 --> 20:36.778
That's how Team Shuster plays.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.822
Enjoy it, baby.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.366
<i>Concession from the Swiss,</i>

20:41.408 --> 20:43.910
<i>and the U.S. still alive.</i>

20:45.620 --> 20:47.372
<i>narrator:</i>
<i>As the U.S. kept winning,</i>

20:47.414 --> 20:48.707
<i>millions back home</i>

20:48.748 --> 20:51.459
<i>fell in love</i>
<i>with the team of rejects.</i>

20:51.501 --> 20:56.089
<i>America was a country</i>
<i>gripped by curling fever.</i>

20:57.424 --> 20:58.883
<i>It was so much fun.</i>

20:58.925 --> 21:00.677
<i>The number of notifications</i>
<i>that were people</i>

21:00.719 --> 21:02.971
<i>saying something to you</i>
<i>in a positive matter,</i>

21:03.013 --> 21:05.598
it was, like, unlike anything
I had ever seen.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.058
I don't think we had a clue

21:07.100 --> 21:10.145
how many people were paying
attention and watching.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.939
- Curling is having
something of a moment.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.444
<i>- John Shuster</i>
<i>with another beauty.</i>

21:17.485 --> 21:19.320
It gave us more inspiration

21:19.362 --> 21:22.032
to go out and do well
again and again and again.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.952
<i>That's it.</i>

21:25.994 --> 21:28.913
<i>Three straight wins</i>
<i>from Team USA,</i>

21:28.955 --> 21:32.208
<i>and their medal hopes</i>
<i>are alive.</i>

21:32.250 --> 21:34.336
Come on!

21:37.797 --> 21:40.133
<i>- Team Shuster now has</i>
<i>celebrity followers,</i>

21:40.175 --> 21:43.553
<i>including Mr. T.</i>

21:43.595 --> 21:45.096
<i>- John never saw</i>
<i>this positive side</i>

21:45.138 --> 21:47.140
of social media before,
because we had such--

21:47.182 --> 21:49.434
we, like, finally
went on a winning streak.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.686
I rem--dude...

21:51.728 --> 21:54.731
<i>narrator: Positive feedback</i>
<i>on social media.</i>

21:54.773 --> 21:57.108
<i>Take that, Shusterers!</i>

21:57.150 --> 21:59.861
<i>And while people falling</i>
<i>for a team of curlers</i>

21:59.903 --> 22:02.197
<i>might have seemed</i>
<i>surprising to some,</i>

22:02.238 --> 22:04.783
<i>not so to Matt Hamilton.</i>

22:04.824 --> 22:06.743
- You see, like,
an Olympic speedskater

22:06.785 --> 22:09.788
and his, like, legs
are tree trunks, right?

22:09.829 --> 22:11.122
And you see
the hockey players, and, like,

22:11.164 --> 22:13.083
they're professional
hockey players.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.793
Then you see curlers,
and they're, like,

22:14.834 --> 22:16.795
"That dude looks just like me."

22:16.836 --> 22:18.088
Like, there's a meme
that, like,

22:18.129 --> 22:19.881
got really popular
and went around.

22:19.923 --> 22:22.300
It was like, "Team USA
looks like a bunch of dads

22:22.342 --> 22:24.552
"that tried to get away
from their family for a weekend

22:24.594 --> 22:26.638
and wound up
winning the Olympics."

22:26.680 --> 22:28.473
And it's just, it's funny,

22:28.515 --> 22:30.350
'cause it's--it's kinda true.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.144
We're just more relatable
than a lot of other

22:33.186 --> 22:34.813
Olympic athletes,
and I think that has

22:34.854 --> 22:36.189
a little bit
to do with it as well.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.984
<i>- Well, a few days ago,</i>
<i>the U.S. men's curling team</i>

22:40.026 --> 22:42.570
<i>was reeling,</i>
<i>one loss from elimination.</i>

22:42.612 --> 22:46.991
<i>But now, they're one win away</i>
<i>from playing for Olympic gold.</i>

22:47.033 --> 22:48.410
<i>United States</i>
<i>needing to beat Canada</i>

22:48.451 --> 22:50.745
<i>for the second time</i>
<i>in this tournament.</i>

22:50.787 --> 22:52.580
<i>- If you asked them</i>
<i>who they wanted to play,</i>

22:52.622 --> 22:54.416
<i>100% of the time</i>
<i>they were saying,</i>

22:54.457 --> 22:56.418
<i>"We would rather play USA</i>
<i>than any other team,"</i>

22:56.459 --> 22:58.003
<i>even though we just beat 'em.</i>

22:58.044 --> 23:00.505
<i>100% of the time</i>
<i>they're taking us.</i>

23:00.547 --> 23:03.842
So...joke's on them.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.971
- Looks good.
- Yep.

23:08.013 --> 23:09.723
Hard! Hard!

23:09.764 --> 23:12.308
<i>- The semifinal game</i>
<i>at the Olympics</i>

23:12.350 --> 23:15.145
<i>is the toughest game</i>
<i>in curling.</i>

23:15.186 --> 23:16.688
<i>narrator:</i>
<i>Like the age-old debate</i>

23:16.730 --> 23:18.898
<i>over who has better bacon,</i>

23:18.940 --> 23:21.234
<i>the battle between</i>
<i>the U.S. and Canada</i>

23:21.276 --> 23:22.986
<i>was tense and heated...</i>

23:23.028 --> 23:25.030
<i>It's only one for Canada.</i>

23:25.071 --> 23:28.241
<i>narrator: With neither team</i>
<i>giving an inch.</i>

23:28.283 --> 23:30.577
<i>Shuster on the money.</i>

23:32.787 --> 23:34.372
<i>The Americans</i>
<i>are hanging in there</i>

23:34.414 --> 23:36.332
<i>against Team Canada here.</i>

23:37.125 --> 23:38.918
<i>- So now they're waiting</i>
<i>to see who gets that</i>

23:38.960 --> 23:40.420
<i>first two points.</i>

23:40.462 --> 23:41.880
I like the line.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.381
- Hard, Benny!
- Hard, Benny.

23:43.423 --> 23:44.424
Not close, boys.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.134
<i>Wow. Not even close.</i>

23:46.176 --> 23:49.554
<i>That's a steal of two</i>
<i>for the United States.</i>

23:49.596 --> 23:51.890
<i>A huge swing in this game.</i>

23:51.931 --> 23:53.558
<i>narrator: It appeared</i>
<i>John Shuster's luck</i>

23:53.600 --> 23:55.143
<i>had turned.</i>

23:55.185 --> 23:57.103
<i>After that mistake by Canada,</i>

23:57.145 --> 24:00.482
<i>the skip had one shot</i>
<i>to win the match.</i>

24:00.523 --> 24:03.777
<i>The curling gods couldn't have</i>
<i>scripted it any better.</i>

24:03.818 --> 24:07.447
<i>John Shuster and Team USA</i>

24:07.489 --> 24:10.075
<i>with American curling history.</i>

24:10.116 --> 24:13.411
<i>They're off to play for gold</i>
<i>for the first time ever.</i>

24:13.453 --> 24:14.704
- I want gold.
- Yeah!

24:14.746 --> 24:17.624
I want gold. I want gold!

24:17.665 --> 24:19.751
- We're not done.
- I want gold.

24:19.793 --> 24:21.628
<i>I got an Olympic medal</i>
<i>back in 2006,</i>

24:21.670 --> 24:22.837
<i>but I remember</i>
<i>what it felt like</i>

24:22.879 --> 24:24.255
<i>standing on that podium,</i>

24:24.297 --> 24:26.049
<i>watching somebody else's flag</i>
<i>go up on the top</i>

24:26.091 --> 24:27.342
<i>and that national anthem.</i>

24:27.384 --> 24:28.635
<i>And it's something</i>
<i>I've dreamt about--</i>

24:28.677 --> 24:31.137
is to see that
American flag at the top,

24:31.179 --> 24:32.972
in the middle,
and hear our national anthem.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.183
Come on!

24:40.772 --> 24:41.981
- Oh, look who's
got one over here!

24:42.023 --> 24:43.400
Look who caught a fish!

24:43.441 --> 24:45.819
- Look who's got a fish!
You're missing it!

24:45.860 --> 24:47.237
Yeah, they're missing it.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.155
I need the video evidence
of this.

24:49.197 --> 24:51.199
- It never happens.
- Yeah, finally.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.994
Monster.

24:55.036 --> 24:57.497
- Got it? Getting it?
- Yeah.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.624
Mwah.

24:59.666 --> 25:02.669
<i>narrator: It's not about</i>
<i>the size of the trophy.</i>

25:02.711 --> 25:04.754
<i>It's how you earn it.</i>

25:04.796 --> 25:07.465
<i>Four years ago,</i>
<i>a group of everyday guys</i>

25:07.507 --> 25:08.925
<i>nobody had ever heard of</i>

25:08.967 --> 25:11.594
<i>went on a magical</i>
<i>Olympic ride,</i>

25:11.636 --> 25:15.348
<i>and they did it</i>
<i>with patience, resilience,</i>

25:15.390 --> 25:18.184
<i>and, sure,</i>
<i>a little bit of style.</i>

25:18.226 --> 25:20.020
- You know, during
the Olympics, you know,

25:20.061 --> 25:21.688
Matt had--you know,
his mustache

25:21.730 --> 25:23.189
got all this publicity.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.357
Mario.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.526
Red hat and the mustache.

25:26.568 --> 25:27.944
<i>Chris and Matt go way back</i>

25:27.986 --> 25:29.779
<i>and are really, really,</i>
<i>really good buddies.</i>

25:29.821 --> 25:32.032
But, you know,
we beat Chris and his team

25:32.073 --> 25:33.491
to get to the Olympics,

25:33.533 --> 25:36.077
and Chris is, like,

<i>'cause he knows</i>
<i>Matt's just eating that up.</i>

25:40.999 --> 25:42.709
- Like, 100% eating it up.
- I'm still--I'm still, like--

25:42.751 --> 25:44.753
truly, I'm still waiting
for my check.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.713

- Must have gotten lost.

25:46.755 --> 25:48.798
- Me too.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.216
Must have gotten lost.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.093
- During the gold medal game,
they panned to me,

25:52.135 --> 25:54.220
and I do my little, like,
twist the mustache,

25:54.262 --> 25:56.556

Didn't say hi to my family.

26:03.855 --> 26:05.398

the love really lies.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.359
- Right.

26:09.736 --> 26:10.945
I mean.

26:17.202 --> 26:19.412
<i>- We weren't, like,</i>

26:21.414 --> 26:22.916
<i>It was just, like,</i>

26:22.957 --> 26:25.335
we're just curling here.

26:25.377 --> 26:27.754
It's kind of like, from
the classic "Hoosier" movie.

26:27.796 --> 26:30.173
They go to the big court
in Indianapolis,

26:30.215 --> 26:31.508

the free throw line,

26:31.549 --> 26:32.759
<i>they measure</i>
<i>the height of the hoop,</i>

26:32.801 --> 26:34.094
<i>and it's, like,</i>
<i>the exact same.</i>

<i>It's like, the same</i>
<i>with the curling stone.</i>

26:35.470 --> 26:37.847
<i>It's like,</i>
<i>it's still 42 pounds.</i>

26:37.889 --> 26:40.392
<i>Still got to throw it</i>
<i>150 feet.</i>

26:40.433 --> 26:41.810

<i>I was blacked out</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

27:31.234 --> 27:32.861
I couldn't tell you
a single shot in that game.

27:32.902 --> 27:37.240
Well, I can tell you a couple
that the other guy made, but.

27:37.282 --> 27:39.826
That game was just us

the previous four games,

27:42.370 --> 27:44.956
making shots,
calling the right shots,

27:44.998 --> 27:47.500
and keeping constant pressure

27:47.542 --> 27:49.586
<i>on a great curling team.</i>

27:49.627 --> 27:51.212
<i>Shuster stays hot.</i>

27:51.254 --> 27:55.175
<i>The United States</i>
<i>gets its deuce to tie it up.</i>

27:55.216 --> 27:57.010
<i>narrator:</i>
<i>It's a funny thing, pressure.</i>

27:57.052 --> 27:59.721
<i>Team Shuster may have</i>
<i>felt it early,</i>

27:59.763 --> 28:01.514
<i>but when our scrappy underdogs</i>

28:01.556 --> 28:04.642
<i>trailed by only one</i>
<i>at the halfway mark,</i>

28:04.684 --> 28:08.104
<i>it was the Swedes</i>
<i>who started feeling the heat.</i>

28:08.146 --> 28:10.732
- Okay, we got past
the beginning,

28:10.774 --> 28:13.568
where this could have went
the wrong way, and now,

28:13.610 --> 28:14.778
now we go.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.488
- Trust it. Trust it.
You're all over 'em.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.239
You're--it's what
it's all about.

28:18.281 --> 28:20.075
<i>- From then on, like,</i>
<i>we put the pressure on them</i>

28:20.116 --> 28:22.744
<i>every single shot</i>
<i>of every single end.</i>

28:22.786 --> 28:24.829
Let's go!

28:24.871 --> 28:29.084
<i>- A compelling affair,</i>
<i>this battle for gold.</i>

28:29.125 --> 28:34.005
<i>The U.S.</i>
<i>and their fans love it.</i>

28:36.716 --> 28:39.886
<i>And Niklas Adin</i>
<i>somehow pulls it off.</i>

28:39.928 --> 28:42.555
<i>But it's only one.</i>

28:42.597 --> 28:44.891
<i>Tie game.</i>

28:44.933 --> 28:46.851
<i>narrator: Heading into</i>
<i>the final three ends,</i>

28:46.893 --> 28:49.312
<i>the match was tied at five.</i>

28:49.354 --> 28:51.398
<i>The gold</i>
<i>would have to be earned</i>

28:51.439 --> 28:54.651
<i>the only way</i>
<i>Team USA knew how:</i>

28:54.693 --> 28:56.486
<i>the hard way.</i>

28:59.739 --> 29:02.117
<i>- Last here for Adin</i>
<i>in the eighth.</i>

29:05.036 --> 29:09.290
<i>Needing a perfect roll here.</i>

29:09.332 --> 29:11.668
<i>Doesn't quite roll enough.</i>

29:11.710 --> 29:17.173
<i>So a huge potential here</i>
<i>for the U.S.</i>

29:17.215 --> 29:21.970
<i>This is a potential</i>
<i>double for five,</i>

29:22.012 --> 29:25.557
<i>and maybe gold for the U.S.</i>

29:25.598 --> 29:27.308
<i>- I knew</i>
<i>I was gonna make the shot.</i>

29:27.350 --> 29:30.270
And it seemed like déjà vu,
because I play Jeff Eriksson

29:30.311 --> 29:32.480
from our curling club
one-on-one.

29:32.522 --> 29:34.190
When I stood up and look,
I'm like,

29:34.232 --> 29:35.984
"I had to throw this
same shot against Jeff

29:36.026 --> 29:37.068
"when I played him
the last game

29:37.110 --> 29:38.486
before I left
for the Olympics."

29:38.528 --> 29:40.238
<i>And all of a sudden I had</i>
<i>the ability to look up</i>

29:40.280 --> 29:42.449
<i>and be like, I feel like</i>
<i>I've seen this before.</i>

29:42.490 --> 29:45.410
<i>- So John Shuster,</i>
<i>last eight years,</i>

29:45.452 --> 29:48.079
<i>at times, he's floundered.</i>

29:48.121 --> 29:51.624
<i>Tying to finish</i>
<i>a remarkable turnaround.</i>

29:51.666 --> 29:53.752
<i>- Going into that shot,</i>
<i>before John even threw it,</i>

29:53.793 --> 29:55.628
I'm like, he's gonna make this,
we're gonna get five,

29:55.670 --> 29:58.631
and we're gonna win
a gold medal right now.

30:05.263 --> 30:06.639
All you guys.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.648
all: Yeah!

30:15.690 --> 30:19.527
<i>- Five on the board</i>
<i>for Team USA!</i>

30:19.569 --> 30:20.945
He did it!

30:20.987 --> 30:26.117


30:27.452 --> 30:28.745
<i>- I turned right around</i>
<i>to get--</i>

30:28.787 --> 30:31.164
<i>go to John</i>
<i>and give him a high five,</i>

30:31.206 --> 30:33.208
<i>and he just had this huge grin</i>

30:33.249 --> 30:35.377
<i>and these big eyes.</i>
<i>I'll never forget.</i>

30:35.418 --> 30:37.504
Like, 'cause, you know
we were both thinking it,

30:37.545 --> 30:39.089
and no one really wanted
to be like,

30:39.130 --> 30:41.633
"We just won a gold medal."

30:41.675 --> 30:43.093
But we were thinking it.

30:43.134 --> 30:45.470
Just kind of, like,
you could tell.

30:49.683 --> 30:52.310
<i>And that is it.</i>

30:52.352 --> 30:54.604
<i>Concession.</i>

30:54.646 --> 30:58.817
<i>The United States has won</i>
<i>curling gold at the Olympics.</i>

30:58.858 --> 31:01.611
- You want to hug me still?
You still want to hug me?

31:01.653 --> 31:03.029
Whoo!

31:35.353 --> 31:37.814
- We wanted to win
a gold medal,

31:37.856 --> 31:39.649
and it's true now!

31:43.028 --> 31:44.863
- Yeah.
- Wow.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.156
<i>My parents and wife</i>

31:46.197 --> 31:47.824
<i>have always done</i>
<i>everything they could</i>

31:47.866 --> 31:50.577
<i>to help me chase my dreams</i>
<i>and accomplish my dream,</i>

31:50.618 --> 31:55.707
<i>and achieving that</i>
<i>with them in attendance was...</i>

31:55.749 --> 31:57.917
pretty damn good.

32:02.339 --> 32:04.549
<i>- I'm not one</i>
<i>to really compare,</i>

32:04.591 --> 32:07.844
but people have called us
the Mira-curl on Ice too,

32:07.886 --> 32:11.097
so I--I don't know.

32:11.139 --> 32:14.559
- And it was
the Mira-curl on ice.

32:14.601 --> 32:18.271
<i>The U.S. men's curling team</i>
<i>getting gold against Sweden.</i>

32:18.313 --> 32:20.398
<i>They're on their way</i>
<i>back home.</i>

32:27.447 --> 32:29.949
<i>- Man, did I make</i>
<i>the right choice.</i>

32:29.991 --> 32:32.827
<i>I decided to pursue curling,</i>

32:32.869 --> 32:36.456
The lucrative,
lucrative sport of curling.

32:36.498 --> 32:39.334
And it paid off
to be an Olympic gold.

32:39.376 --> 32:40.794
So, it's pretty crazy.

32:50.053 --> 32:52.263
<i>- We spent four years</i>
<i>grinding together</i>

32:52.305 --> 32:53.515
<i>and then stood</i>
<i>on the podium together.</i>

32:53.556 --> 32:56.267
I think that's what made
even being on the podium

32:56.309 --> 32:58.186
that much more meaningful,
which, again--

32:58.228 --> 32:59.437
- How much--how much--

32:59.479 --> 33:01.272
how much do you want to repeat?

33:01.314 --> 33:02.691
- The only thing
that does scare me--

33:02.732 --> 33:05.235
like, I want to repeat, but,
like, it scares me, like,

33:05.276 --> 33:07.529
there's gonna be, like,
an expectation

33:07.570 --> 33:09.197
- after the last one.
- Yeah, I know.

33:09.239 --> 33:10.657
- We got hot, man.
Like, it's--it's--really,

33:10.699 --> 33:11.908
that's kinda
what curling's about,

33:11.950 --> 33:13.660
is who's got the hot hand
during that week.

33:13.702 --> 33:16.121
- 100%.
It'd be pretty dope, though.

33:16.162 --> 33:17.872
- Sure would.
- Be the only team ever.

33:17.914 --> 33:19.833
- Yeah.
- Yeah, 'cause no one's ever

33:19.874 --> 33:23.795
repeated in--like,
there's actually been only

33:23.837 --> 33:26.214
one team that's even
went back to the Olympics

33:26.256 --> 33:29.676
and had the chance
at repeating.

33:29.718 --> 33:31.344
You know? Trying to--
trying to get back

33:31.386 --> 33:33.096
to the Olympics to, you know,

33:33.138 --> 33:35.807
honestly see if we can
get that magic going again.

33:35.849 --> 33:38.435
Best fishing day ever.

33:38.476 --> 33:40.145
- Beat you on that bike ride.
Come on, bud.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.939
<i>narrator: Next time,</i>
<i>on "American Rock Stars."</i>

33:42.981 --> 33:45.692
- You can stop filming me
after 30 seconds.

33:45.734 --> 33:47.402
<i>narrator:</i>
<i>The honeymoon is over,</i>

33:47.444 --> 33:51.197
<i>as Team Shuster's Olympic</i>
<i>Trial preparations ramp up...</i>

Get up, son.
