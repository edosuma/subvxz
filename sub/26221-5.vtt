That guy, mustache.

18:34.915 --> 18:37.016
<i>Okay, he didn't. But it's Griff.</i>

18:37.050 --> 18:40.119

[dance music]

18:44.124 --> 18:46.792
Oh, hey! What's up little ladies?
Any requests?

18:46.826 --> 18:50.129
You're revolting! Men like you
are the reason we're changing the world.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.931
We're gonna run this company one day.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.899
So you better get used to it!

18:56.136 --> 19:00.139
Huh. See that? I knew I had something
to contribute to your mentees, Norman.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.608
Without guys like me,
there is no women's movement.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.710
I'm like... I inspire them. I'm the hero,

19:04.744 --> 19:07.146
because I'm the villain. Yeah!

19:07.180 --> 19:11.884
- Wow, that guy is incredible...
- Horrific.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.954
- Horrific.
- Horrific.

19:16.690 --> 19:17.990
- Oh...
- Why were we

19:18.024 --> 19:19.725
so hard on ourselves back then?

19:19.759 --> 19:22.594
Look at my skin. I wanna lick it.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.596
I did, and it was great.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.933
Oh... look at that handsome schmuck.

19:27.968 --> 19:30.736
He probably could have
gotten any girl he wanted...

19:30.770 --> 19:32.304
I mean, that girl was you.

19:33.304 --> 19:34.573
And so, he did.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.008
- You know what's sad?
- Hmm?

19:36.042 --> 19:37.509
Right now's the best we'll ever look.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.178
I disagree with... [burp]

19:39.212 --> 19:41.814
Whoa!

19:41.848 --> 19:43.248
You're right,
we're not turning this thing around.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.817
We're on a luge to death.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.686
Maybe that's why we got so carried away.

19:47.721 --> 19:50.689
But you know what?
As long as we're into each other,

19:50.724 --> 19:53.025
we're good. Although,
one more of those demon burps,

19:53.059 --> 19:54.126
and this house of cards tumbles.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.260
[laughing]

19:55.295 --> 19:56.695
It's not good.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.030
Well, if I have to get old,

19:58.064 --> 20:00.099
I am glad that I get to do it with you.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.700
[bottles clink]

20:01.735 --> 20:03.335
Let's just be honest
with each other, please?

20:03.370 --> 20:07.206
No more Fat Pats, no secret bathroom eating.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.841
Oh... toilet cake?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.142
I mean, where does the cake come from?

20:10.176 --> 20:11.710
Does he sneak it in there?

20:11.745 --> 20:13.879
Or does he store the cake in the bathroom?

20:14.961 --> 20:17.316
Some mysteries are never meant to be solved.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.726
You had to put it up.

20:27.761 --> 20:29.194
We're sorry you didn't
get the perfect photo,

20:29.229 --> 20:32.898
but you do look like a very capable woman.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.800
Capable of guarding a bridge.

20:35.354 --> 20:36.702
Okay, you know what? Shut up, Griff.

I don't care what you think, 'cause someday

20:39.239 --> 20:41.006
20 years from now when I see that picture

20:41.041 --> 20:43.075
I'm gonna think: "Damn, I was hot."

I know you'll never admit it, but I know you
care about me and I care about you.

So I'm actually gonna
give you a sincere hug.

Did you see that?

21:14.240 --> 21:16.375
- I did.
- Did you see the hair tousle?
