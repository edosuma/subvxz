in some flooding last fall,

00:20.478 --> 00:23.186
but, fuckin', I didn't.

00:23.269 --> 00:24.603
And, Baba, let me tell you,

00:24.687 --> 00:27.561
there are some boss jams
on that thing.

00:27.645 --> 00:28.978
Mm-hmm.

00:29.770 --> 00:31.603

00:31.687 --> 00:33.812
Well, I'll give you one
when I see you.

00:33.895 --> 00:35.019

Hey, what was that
Chardonnay barrel-aged sour
you gave me last week?

07:23.812 --> 07:25.895
The Handfarm
from Tired Hands.

07:25.978 --> 07:28.144
Do you have another sour
or a farmhouse

07:28.228 --> 07:29.770
that you would recommend?

I think I got something
for you.

Hey, I'm here!

08:16.895 --> 08:19.019
Where you at, Baba?

08:23.228 --> 08:24.687
Are you upstairs?

08:24.770 --> 08:26.895
(footsteps ascending)

08:33.395 --> 08:34.853
Suzanne:
He wanted to die
young, though.

08:34.937 --> 08:38.186
He told me he hoped
he didn't make it past 40.

08:38.269 --> 08:41.687
But that was when
we were dating, like
a million years ago.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.770
-I'm sorry.
This is my husband, Bill.
-Hi. Jerry.

08:44.853 --> 08:47.520
Suzanne:
Bill and I both teach
poli-sci at Vassar.

08:47.603 --> 08:49.269
Suzanne:
How'd you know Berg?

08:49.353 --> 08:52.478
Jerry:
We met at the college
radio station 15 years ago.

08:52.561 --> 08:55.978
-He sold me pot ever since.
-Oh, sounds about right.

08:56.061 --> 08:59.353
But every time I'd call him out
on that funny smell wafting
in our windows,

08:59.436 --> 09:02.561
he'd say,
"Who me? There's skunks
everywhere, man."

09:02.645 --> 09:06.395
He taught me guitar,
but it's not like we ever got
to the lessons or anything.

09:06.478 --> 09:09.895
I know, I know.
"Let me twist one up
for us, Baba."

09:09.978 --> 09:12.937
Yeah. "Forget about
the notes, man.
Let's jam!"

09:13.019 --> 09:14.770
"Life is funny..."

09:14.853 --> 09:17.019
Both:
"Bees make honey!"

09:17.103 --> 09:18.853
-Sal: What a guy.
-Joy: Oh, my gosh.

09:18.937 --> 09:21.770
That sweet, man.
Oh, I'm gonna miss him.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.311
But it's beautiful to see
all these people here.

09:25.395 --> 09:27.561
(Joy continues
indistinctly)

09:27.645 --> 09:29.978
(softly):
I got you something, Baba.

09:33.478 --> 09:37.978
(chattering, laughing)

09:40.770 --> 09:44.478
Yo. What's up, man?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.019
-Hey.
-How are you?

09:47.103 --> 09:49.228
-I'm doin' good, man.
Good to see you.
-It's been a while.

09:49.311 --> 09:52.061
Man, I can't even remember
the last time I saw you.

09:52.144 --> 09:53.770
I think it was...

09:53.853 --> 09:56.937
You were with a guy
from Kentucky on a motorcycle.

09:57.019 --> 09:58.520
-Right.
-Yeah, man.

09:58.603 --> 10:01.728
Dude, you and your wife
were here, camping in a tent
on the lawn.

10:01.812 --> 10:03.728
Oh yeah.
Good memory.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.645
What's up, man?
How are you?

10:05.728 --> 10:08.687
You know, I mean, I'm growing
in the Berkshires now.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.478
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

10:10.561 --> 10:13.186
Goddamn, I keep forgetting
Massachusetts is legal,

10:13.269 --> 10:15.019
and, like, right there.

10:15.103 --> 10:16.937
It's fucking crazy, dude.

10:17.019 --> 10:18.937
I mean, I spent years
smoking Berg-schwag,

10:19.019 --> 10:21.645
but this past year,
I've been supplying him

10:21.728 --> 10:24.395
with the kindest bud
you ever saw.

10:24.478 --> 10:25.812
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

10:25.895 --> 10:27.687
You know, maybe I should
get your number.

10:27.770 --> 10:31.353
-I'm always looking for, like,
uh, someone to hang out with.
-For sure.

10:31.436 --> 10:32.853
I know what you mean.

10:32.937 --> 10:35.103
-Hey!
-Hey.

10:35.186 --> 10:38.269
I think this is for you.
That's your RV outside, right?

10:38.353 --> 10:40.853
-Yeah. Oh, wow,
that is me.
-Yeah.

10:40.937 --> 10:43.353
I found it when
I was cleaning up.

10:43.436 --> 10:45.895
Man, I was supposed
to come up this week,

10:46.019 --> 10:49.520
but, uh...
I guess I just missed him.

10:52.103 --> 10:54.603
-You know, this is
a great party, Cori.
-Thanks.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.144
It's really cool.
I want to put this pie down.

10:57.228 --> 10:58.895
Suzanne:
Anyway, I...

10:58.978 --> 11:01.395
I don't actually think
that he was lonely.

11:01.478 --> 11:07.395
That man had a very rich
interior life and world.

11:08.478 --> 11:11.478
He kept his cup very full,

11:12.061 --> 11:16.144
and I feel like
one of the lucky people
he gave a drink to.

11:16.228 --> 11:17.770
-(chuckling)
-Woman: Yeah.

11:17.853 --> 11:19.311
Suzanne:
To Berg.

11:19.395 --> 11:20.853
All:
To Berg!

11:20.937 --> 11:23.353
Greg:
Whoa, heh.
Getting smoky in here.

11:23.436 --> 11:24.895
Suzanne:
Goddamn right!

11:24.978 --> 11:30.061
Um, thanks for coming everyone.

11:30.144 --> 11:32.853
It's really awesome to be

11:32.937 --> 11:35.603
with a bunch of people
who loved Berg.

11:35.687 --> 11:39.353
Uh, I'm Cori.
I was his friend,

11:39.436 --> 11:44.645
and I was his neighbor
for the last couple of years.

11:45.478 --> 11:47.436
I live upstairs.

11:48.269 --> 11:54.603
And we had
this weekly ritual of...

11:55.478 --> 11:58.520
Well, it was more
like a daily ritual
of getting stoned.

11:58.603 --> 12:00.269
(laughter)

12:00.353 --> 12:06.269
And we would watch old episodes
of Doctor Who  together.

12:06.353 --> 12:09.186
And I would bring over
a nice beer,

12:09.269 --> 12:11.895
and he would order a pizza

12:11.978 --> 12:15.561
from Emiliano's--
an onion pizza, just onions.

12:15.645 --> 12:18.228
(laughter)

12:18.311 --> 12:22.436
But I'm rambling now.
Um...

12:23.853 --> 12:27.603
You know, like, Berg didn't have
much in the way of blood family,

12:27.687 --> 12:31.144
and he and I had
that in common...

12:33.061 --> 12:37.770
(voice breaking):
but he was, like,
better than any family.

12:40.478 --> 12:43.603
Better than any family
that I've ever known.

12:46.770 --> 12:50.561
And the thing that I appreciate
about-- appreciate about him

12:50.645 --> 12:53.937
is that he never judged me
for anything.

12:54.019 --> 12:55.603
Woman:
Yeah, that's right.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.186
He...

12:58.520 --> 13:02.186
-He didn't judge anyone,
did he? So...
-Woman: No.

13:03.103 --> 13:06.436
He just, like,
would let you be...

13:06.520 --> 13:10.311
exactly the kind of person
that you needed to be.

13:12.603 --> 13:16.478
-Like, you didn't have
to clean up your place for him.
-(laughter)

13:17.728 --> 13:19.645
He just was easy.

13:20.436 --> 13:23.228
(crying):
And he was
my friend, so...

13:25.770 --> 13:27.311
Cori:
To Berg.

13:27.395 --> 13:28.895
All:
To Berg!

13:34.228 --> 13:35.520
I'll go.

13:35.603 --> 13:38.311
-Come on, everyone. Let's jam!
-Wait. I was gonna--

13:38.395 --> 13:41.061

13:41.144 --> 13:42.645
Rita:
What should we play?

13:42.728 --> 13:46.144
He always ended every radio set
with "Crimson and Clover."

13:46.228 --> 13:49.853
-(cheers, applause)
-Rita: Oh, boy.
That brings back memories.

13:49.937 --> 13:51.978

-I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you.
-Oh, no, no.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.395
I was just seeing
if maybe Berg

15:21.478 --> 15:23.728
had decided
to stick around
in here.

15:23.812 --> 15:27.937
-You know, he left his body
while he was in a bath.
-Oh, wow.

15:28.019 --> 15:30.561
I didn't know that.
I can let you have
your privacy.

15:30.645 --> 15:32.144
No, no, no, no.
It's all right.

15:32.228 --> 15:35.603
I'm sure he's still
circulating this party...

15:35.687 --> 15:37.728
(laughing):
if I know Berg.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.895
-All right.
-(Rita chuckles)

16:03.520 --> 16:05.478
(birds singing)

16:06.853 --> 16:08.478
Well, shit.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.853
All right.

16:15.561 --> 16:17.687
(ducks quacking)

16:35.061 --> 16:36.395
(exhales)

16:47.978 --> 16:50.061
(loon wails)

17:52.645 --> 17:54.770
(sighs)

18:08.937 --> 18:10.978
-Sorry to be nosy.
-Oh.

18:11.311 --> 18:13.812
Was that weed I smelled earlier?

18:14.937 --> 18:16.728
-Oh, yeah.
-Amazing.

18:16.812 --> 18:18.687
Sorry, I'm coming at you
like some fiend.

18:18.770 --> 18:20.937
It's not for me,
it's for my friend.

18:22.937 --> 18:24.019
The Guy:
Aw, man.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.895
Yeah, this is Nigel.
He's got a problem.

18:26.978 --> 18:29.561
I'm Lee.
I'm totally cool.

18:29.645 --> 18:32.269
(chuckles)
Hi, Lee. I'm...

18:32.353 --> 18:34.603
-(coughing)
-Oh, I'm sorry.

18:34.687 --> 18:37.269
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

18:37.353 --> 18:38.895
Want so--

18:38.978 --> 18:40.770
-Want some more?
-No.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.269
(laughing):
No, I do not.

18:42.353 --> 18:44.186
-I'm so sorry.
-It's all right.

18:44.895 --> 18:47.645
So, color consultant.
Do you have like...

18:49.186 --> 18:51.978
-mental associations
with colors?
-Mm-hmm.

18:52.061 --> 18:53.937
-Like, are you a synesthete?
-A little bit.

18:54.019 --> 18:56.645
I mean, there are
some associations.
It's not-- It's...

18:57.687 --> 19:01.395
I don't necessarily,
like, uh, hear green.

19:01.478 --> 19:05.520
But if I said the number six,
would you have a color in mind?

19:05.603 --> 19:08.520
Hmm... curry.

19:08.603 --> 19:09.645
Curry.

19:09.728 --> 19:12.895
What about summertime?

19:14.728 --> 19:15.645
Peach.

19:15.728 --> 19:18.520
Ooh. Loneliness?

19:18.603 --> 19:21.687
Indigo, definitely.

19:25.895 --> 19:27.520
Yeah.

19:28.436 --> 19:30.228
I like this RV.

19:30.311 --> 19:32.853
Yeah, it's awesome.
I love it.

19:32.937 --> 19:35.561
I've been just chillin'
for like the last two weeks.

19:35.645 --> 19:38.228
-(Nigel growling)
-Having the time
of my fucking life.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.103
-What's up, buddy?
-Hey, buddy!

19:40.186 --> 19:42.728
Oh, he's hungry.
We gotta feed him.

19:43.728 --> 19:44.978
Do you want to eat?

19:45.061 --> 19:47.770
(growling)

19:50.144 --> 19:51.687
(growling continues)

19:51.770 --> 19:53.895
What, does he have to answer
before you feed him?

19:53.978 --> 19:56.311
Do you-- do you want to eat?
Do you?

19:56.395 --> 19:57.978
Well, you were looking
at the dog.

19:58.061 --> 20:01.019
Right, and then I turned--
I pivoted my head
and looked at you.

20:01.103 --> 20:03.061
-Well, now you're looking at me.
-Now I'm looking at you.

20:03.144 --> 20:06.019
-Do you want to eat?
-Okay.

20:06.103 --> 20:08.269
(distant train horn blaring)

20:23.687 --> 20:25.728
Woman:
It's crazy.
But you know what?

20:25.812 --> 20:27.436
Stella loves that.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.395
Woman 2:
I know. And I'm still going
to ask her to cover for me.

20:30.478 --> 20:31.770
(chuckles)

20:31.853 --> 20:35.269
Um, I loved this. Can I have
a growler to take home?

20:35.353 --> 20:37.603
-Yeah, you got it.
-Thank you.

20:59.687 --> 21:01.770
Cori:
Hey, sorry. I said onions.

21:01.853 --> 21:03.395
Not veggie, just onions.

21:03.478 --> 21:05.770
Man:
Ah, sorry Cori.
No problem.

21:05.853 --> 21:09.478
-Don't forget me.
-Oh. Sarah...

21:10.895 --> 21:13.144
Dr. Who:
Don't you forget me.

21:15.436 --> 21:17.645
-Sarah: Bye, Doctor.
-Dr. Who: Bye.

21:18.687 --> 21:20.812
(cell phone vibrating)

21:20.895 --> 21:24.103
Sarah:
You know, travel
does broaden the mind.

21:24.186 --> 21:25.853
Dr. Who:
Yes.

21:26.728 --> 21:28.895
Until we meet again,
Sarah.

21:34.436 --> 21:35.978
(phone clatters)

21:41.269 --> 21:43.395
The Guy:
Okay, the results are in.
You ready?

21:43.478 --> 21:47.687
-Lee: Mm.
-You're gonna be married
to Angela Merkel,

21:47.770 --> 21:50.812
-and you'll have 2,001
children together.
-Wow.

21:50.895 --> 21:54.478
Your car will be self-driving,
and you'll live in a shack.

21:54.561 --> 21:55.728
Nice.

21:55.812 --> 21:59.478
Angela's a boss, super hot.
I can make a shack cute.

21:59.561 --> 22:01.603
Cute shack, baby.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.770
-Your turn.
-Go for it.

22:05.061 --> 22:08.186
All right.
Your future awaits.

22:08.269 --> 22:10.770
Potential spouses...

22:12.895 --> 22:15.103
I don't want to get
married again.

22:15.186 --> 22:16.978
-Lee: No?
-Well, I don't know.

22:17.061 --> 22:19.561
-You want to get married?
-Uh...

22:20.186 --> 22:22.395
Technically,
I'm not divorced yet.

22:25.395 --> 22:27.687
Well, you know,
it takes a while.

22:27.770 --> 22:30.436
-Uh-huh.
-At least a year
sometimes.

22:32.395 --> 22:33.728
Yeah.

22:35.186 --> 22:38.395
I'd prefer it didn't
take so long.

22:38.978 --> 22:40.103
Bad?

22:43.019 --> 22:44.436
Was yours bad?

22:45.687 --> 22:48.520
Oh, no. We're friends.
We're good.

22:48.603 --> 22:50.311
Lucky.

22:51.645 --> 22:56.687
Yeah, I mean, I still
totally get it.

22:56.770 --> 22:59.144
When it wasn't good,
it wasn't good.

23:01.770 --> 23:02.895
Yeah.

23:03.937 --> 23:05.478
I gotta keep going here.

23:05.561 --> 23:08.353
I think we're good
on the game. Mm-hmm.

23:08.436 --> 23:11.311
-We can trash M.A.S.H.
-Let's trash M.A.S.H.

23:17.311 --> 23:18.353
You tired?

23:20.978 --> 23:22.269
All right, I'll just
call a Lyft,

23:22.353 --> 23:23.812
and then you don't
have to drive me back.

23:23.895 --> 23:27.019
It's not a--
I'm kind of drunk, so...

23:27.103 --> 23:29.478
Or you could
just sleep here.

23:32.269 --> 23:33.812
Do you want to?

23:34.853 --> 23:35.978
Yes!

23:37.436 --> 23:39.395
(whispers):
What happened to you?

23:39.478 --> 23:42.103
-What happened--
-Preventative medicine?

23:42.186 --> 23:43.728
Yeah, maybe.

23:43.812 --> 23:45.186
(voice cracking)
Thank you.

23:45.269 --> 23:47.228
-Your voice just cracked.
-I know.

23:47.311 --> 23:50.228
Thanks for dinner. I had
a really nice time with you.

23:50.311 --> 23:54.144
I'm, um... yeah.
I'm glad we met.

23:54.228 --> 23:56.436
Same. Yeah.

23:59.311 --> 24:01.728
All right, well, good night.

24:01.812 --> 24:03.853

-Lee: Hello, hello.
-Hey.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.728
Did you sleep okay?

25:04.812 --> 25:06.645
Yeah, I slept great.

25:06.728 --> 25:08.561
Oh my God.
I feel like a new man.

25:08.645 --> 25:11.603
-Yeah, Paul Newman.
-That's me.

25:11.687 --> 25:12.770
Coffee?

25:12.853 --> 25:14.937
Yeah, sure.
What time is it?

25:15.019 --> 25:17.144
It's about 11:15.

25:17.228 --> 25:19.812
Oh, man. I don't usually
sleep this late.

25:19.895 --> 25:21.561
Well, you probably
needed it.

25:22.812 --> 25:23.937
Yeah.

25:25.770 --> 25:27.603
Um...

25:29.353 --> 25:32.478
-You cool? Everything good?
-Yeah, totally.

25:32.561 --> 25:33.687
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

25:33.770 --> 25:35.269
Um...

25:35.353 --> 25:38.144
There's just a place in town
that I need to go to get
the good eggs,

25:38.228 --> 25:40.603
'cause if you don't get there
by a certain time,
they're all gone.

25:40.687 --> 25:42.103
Oh, yeah. Well...

25:42.186 --> 25:44.436
-(Cockney accent):
Come on, Nigel.
-(Nigel grows)

25:44.520 --> 25:47.186
If we don't get the good eggs,
we'll have to eat gruel.

25:47.269 --> 25:49.728
And that's all we eat.

26:26.269 --> 26:29.061
The Guy:
I was so glad we went.
I miss video stores.

26:29.144 --> 26:31.603
Lee:
Yeah, Joyce's Lawn & Video.

26:31.687 --> 26:34.728
-Joyce is fun.
-She's a gem.

26:34.812 --> 26:37.144
And she had
Drop Dead Gorgeous  ,

26:37.228 --> 26:40.728
which is not a video you can
find online. I've been looking.

26:40.812 --> 26:42.520
(laughing):
Really?

26:42.603 --> 26:44.561
-I needed this, too.
-You did.

26:44.645 --> 26:46.520
I could tell you needed it.

26:50.645 --> 26:52.269
Hey, uh...

26:52.353 --> 26:55.186
This is kind of funny,
but, um...

26:55.853 --> 26:58.144
I saw you buy gas
for that mom the other day.

26:59.353 --> 27:00.978
-Huh.
-That was you, right?

27:01.061 --> 27:03.478
-Wait, really?
-Yeah.

27:05.269 --> 27:08.520
-Yeah. Yeah.
-I can't believe you saw that.

27:10.645 --> 27:13.269
-You do that a lot?
-No.

27:13.353 --> 27:15.395
Well... no.

27:21.228 --> 27:25.853
Funny thing
I didn't mention is that I'm...

27:27.019 --> 27:28.561
pregnant.

27:31.228 --> 27:32.520
Really?

27:35.353 --> 27:36.436
Yep.

27:38.645 --> 27:40.311
Is that a good thing?

27:40.395 --> 27:42.520
(sighs)

27:44.895 --> 27:46.228
Messy?

27:47.395 --> 27:49.061
It's pretty messy.

27:50.353 --> 27:53.770
It's my ex's, so...

27:53.853 --> 27:55.812
You okay?

27:55.895 --> 27:58.728
Yeah.
Yeah, I will be.

28:01.436 --> 28:04.561
You know, what they say about
pregnancies is, "No big deal."

28:04.645 --> 28:07.228
(laughing)
They do say that,
don't they?

28:07.311 --> 28:09.436
-Like... (scoffs)
Whatever.
-Yeah.

28:10.269 --> 28:12.395
Life is funny.
Bees make honey.

28:14.019 --> 28:15.561
Yeah, that's true.

28:15.937 --> 28:17.436
Um...

28:18.144 --> 28:21.978
So you... You for sure have
to go back to the city tonight?

28:22.853 --> 28:24.186
-Yeah.
-Okay.

28:24.269 --> 28:27.770
I'm gonna be there Wednesday.
Do you want to hang out?

28:29.395 --> 28:30.687
Well...

28:30.770 --> 28:31.853
Yes.

28:31.937 --> 28:34.311
-(laughing)
-I do.

28:35.395 --> 28:37.436
Yeah, okay.

29:07.561 --> 29:10.228
I'm not really sure
how to get in there.
It's like there's a--

29:10.311 --> 29:12.144
-I wasn't planning for this.
-It's like a gate.

30:03.061 --> 30:05.853
("Les Amis" by Francois

checked Craigslist?

(YELPS)

33:24.895 --> 33:26.812
How often do you think
Craigslist missed connections

33:26.895 --> 33:28.645
-are about you?
-This is the first one.

33:28.728 --> 33:30.061
I'm so honored.

33:30.770 --> 33:33.687
You wouldn't be interested
in a bag of sand, would you?

33:34.395 --> 33:35.687
Nah, I'm good.

33:36.978 --> 33:37.978

33:38.061 --> 33:40.395
I don't wanna take business away
from myself,

if you should be smoking pot.
