18:52.132 --> 18:54.048
How is this happening?!

18:54.134 --> 18:56.175
How is this happening?!
How is this happening?!

18:56.261 --> 19:01.639
Aah! Get it off!
Get it off before he-- oh!

19:01.766 --> 19:02.807
-Ew.
-Ugh.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.725
-Ow! Ow!
-[lisa] bart, do something!

19:04.811 --> 19:06.644
[grunts]

19:06.729 --> 19:07.645
Sorry.

19:07.730 --> 19:08.938
We thought he loved you.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.773
This is how he shows love.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.151
By grooming me
and regurgitating on me.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.111
I could never have friends over,

19:15.196 --> 19:16.529
He was so possessive.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.780
Mine!

19:17.866 --> 19:20.283
[squawking angrily]

19:28.084 --> 19:29.625
So why did you even get him?

19:29.711 --> 19:32.086
I didn't.
I wanted a kitten.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.338
Our neighbor was
giving away their parrot.

19:34.424 --> 19:38.509
Since petey can meow, my dad
decided he was close enough.

19:38.595 --> 19:39.802
[petey] meow.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.221
-You're nothing like a kitten!
-[all yell]

19:42.348 --> 19:45.183
Don't worry, we'll
take him back to townsburg.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.059
He's part of a wild flock there.

19:47.145 --> 19:49.312
You went all the way
to townsburg?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.772
We wanted to get
you something, you know,

19:51.900 --> 19:53.733
Personal for your birthday.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.403
Yeah. We did not make friends
on the bus ride home.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.071
Petey is kind of racist.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.991
Well, that's just...
[crying]

20:02.076 --> 20:03.367
We're sorry.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.203
We didn't mean to
re-traumatize you

20:05.330 --> 20:07.663
With your childhood
nightmare bird.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.041
My wonderful babies!

20:10.168 --> 20:12.501
You went to all that trouble
for me.

20:12.587 --> 20:16.214
I wasn't an afterthought,
I was a thought.

20:16.299 --> 20:19.800
Well, yeah, 'cause... You know,

20:19.928 --> 20:23.221
We see you as a person.

20:23.348 --> 20:27.516
We really do.
Our favorite person.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.769
Oh, that is so...

20:29.854 --> 20:31.896
-[crunch]
-ow!

20:32.023 --> 20:34.649
You little...

20:34.734 --> 20:38.402
Who wants to help mommy
abandon petey in townsburg?

20:38.529 --> 20:39.779
[both] we do!

20:56.756 --> 20:59.799
Marge, what a beautiful robe.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.384
Is that terry cloth?

21:01.469 --> 21:05.012
French terry, from the terry
province of France.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.014
[excited murmuring]

21:07.141 --> 21:08.474
My kids got it for me.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.644
I just threw it on to see
what that noise was.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.772
I think it came from over there.

21:14.857 --> 21:17.316
Look at the fullness
in that sleeve.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.528
What was that sound?
I don't see anything.

21:20.571 --> 21:24.031
Well, it's a mystery.
We may never know.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.783
-Look at how it moves.
-Poetry in fabric.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.076
You better work.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.538
[bart laughs]

21:30.623 --> 21:32.832
Mission accomplished. Over.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.750
[both] roger that. Over.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.961
Shh!
