Of course

I believe you and I have
something in common after all.

02:50.735 --> 02:51.780
What is that?

02:55.392 --> 02:59.483
The old German word
for wolf is "warg."

02:59.527 --> 03:04.140
Simply translated, it means
strangler and evil spirit.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.098
And wargs were cast out
from society,

03:06.142 --> 03:08.405

in the wilderness.

That's where
the werewolf comes from.

What's going to happen
when we get to Berlin?

03:34.083 --> 03:37.086
My job was to retrieve
the stolen files
and bring them back.

03:38.827 --> 03:39.958
This I've done.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.179
But I'll tell you
something, Emily,

03:43.223 --> 03:45.007
I wouldn't like
to be in your shoes.

03:48.402 --> 03:50.665
Because if your plan
doesn't work,

03:52.362 --> 03:55.974

the last trip
that you ever make.

04:17.169 --> 04:18.388
Yo, Cal.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.266

the airport ground crew,

04:26.309 --> 04:29.399
they confirmed that
the two people on board
the private jet

04:29.443 --> 04:31.967
are matched to Emily
and Dawkins' descriptions.

04:32.010 --> 04:35.318
The FAA flight plan says
they're travelling to Berlin.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.277
Okay, well...

04:37.320 --> 04:39.540
This is Emily's
cell phone call log.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.630
All right.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.284
She made a call
to a German cell phone

04:44.327 --> 04:46.242
a few hours before she hopped
on the plane with Dawkins.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.289
The numbers
aren't registered.

04:52.857 --> 04:55.251
I don't know, Derek.
I don't know what her plan is.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.819
She deliberately
ghosted me.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.577

about a mole.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.187
I did some digging.
Check it out.

internally accessing
Emily and Nick's files,

05:23.714 --> 05:25.542
sending their info
to a secure email.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.718
Yeah, to Dawkins.
Yeah.

05:27.762 --> 05:31.505
So, it seems Meridian
does have an informant
in this office.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.289
That's why Dawkins was always
one step ahead of us.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.464
And look whose account
it's from.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.423
Adam Radford.
He's been dead for ages.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.816
Okay.
Someone's got
his access code.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.690
But do you think whoever is
compromising this office

05:42.733 --> 05:44.822
is being blackmailed
and coerced by Meridian?

05:44.866 --> 05:46.215
That would
make sense.
