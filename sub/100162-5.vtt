00:11.000 --> 00:14.640
[radio] ...to Prime Minister Harold Wilson
and his government today,

00:14.720 --> 00:16.200
as pressure on the pound...

00:21.040 --> 00:22.440
Good afternoon, Mr. King.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.400
-[TV] The damage had been done...
-Afternoon, Mr. King.

00:25.480 --> 00:29.360
Britain's trade gap is
a staggering £107 million.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.920
It's the worst figure on record.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.240
The government said that these figures
were distorted and meaningless.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.520
-[phones ringing]
-[typewritters typing]

00:39.480 --> 00:40.640
Good afternoon, Mr. King.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.640
Good afternoon, Mr. King.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.240
Good afternoon, Mr. King.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.480
Where is it?

00:47.840 --> 00:50.040
Here. Tomorrow's front page, sir.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.800
-Not strong enough.
-It's the strongest headline

00:53.880 --> 00:56.040
the Daily Mirror's ever written
about a Labour leader.

00:56.120 --> 00:59.000
"Bowed head, guilty conscience"?
I don't know what it's saying.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.360
Now I know what it's saying.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.000
[lighter clicks]

01:25.640 --> 01:28.520
It's a sad day when the Daily Mirror,
a Labour-supporting newspaper,

01:28.600 --> 01:30.240
turns against a Labour leader like this.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.760
We've done some thinking

01:35.840 --> 01:39.800
and come up with an idea
for how to deflect any further criticism.

01:39.880 --> 01:40.800
[Wilson] Yeah, go on.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.040
Lord Mountbatten.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.680
What's he got to do with anything?

01:46.760 --> 01:49.360
[Thomson] I'm sure we all agree
that he's a symbol of a bygone era,

01:49.440 --> 01:53.440
of privilege and inequality,
empire and extravagance.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.200
-Not to mention a pompous bloody arse.
-[Wilson] Go on.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.760
[Thomson] As Chief of the Defence Staff,

01:58.840 --> 02:01.680
he's refusing to make
the defense cuts we need,

02:01.760 --> 02:05.440
cuts which you promised
in your election manifesto.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.960
One might even tolerate it
if he weren't so...

02:09.320 --> 02:13.200
-Vain or crooked or power-mad.
-[Thomson] Quite.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.760
What are you proposing?

02:16.680 --> 02:17.920
That we kick him out.

02:21.080 --> 02:24.200
But at least he's busy,
and inside the tent.

02:24.280 --> 02:27.760
You know, people like Mountbatten,
meddlers, for want of a kinder word,

02:27.840 --> 02:29.480
energetic, well-connected meddlers,

02:29.560 --> 02:31.840
it's better that they're inside the tent
pissing out

02:31.920 --> 02:33.600
than outside the tent pissing in.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.560
But he belongs to another time, Harold.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.800
Kicking him out makes economic sense
and shows we're tough.

02:41.200 --> 02:45.200
And who knows?
It might just buy us some good headlines.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.040
Yes, I could do with some good headlines.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.800
[soldier] General salute!

02:55.440 --> 02:59.040
Present... arms!

02:59.120 --> 03:00.360
[boots stamp]

04:20.240 --> 04:22.240
[footsteps approach]

04:28.280 --> 04:30.240
[Wilson] As Chief of the Defence Staff,

04:30.320 --> 04:33.440
you will be aware
that the Treasury has been conducting

04:33.520 --> 04:37.040
a wide-ranging review
of defense spending--

04:37.120 --> 04:39.240
And before you go any further,

04:39.320 --> 04:43.040
the cuts you propose would leave us
hopelessly vulnerable and weak,

04:43.120 --> 04:44.880
especially east of Suez.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.080
Now, are our enemies cutting back
on military spending?

04:48.160 --> 04:51.880
No, they're increasing fivefold, tenfold.

04:51.960 --> 04:56.600
[Wilson] And the conclusion of the review
is that we'd like to make a few changes.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.840
One of which is to your post
of Chief of the Defence Staff.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.160
What?

05:08.840 --> 05:10.400
Are you kicking me out?

05:12.440 --> 05:14.120
Well, no, sir, I'm thanking you

05:14.200 --> 05:16.560
on behalf of the government,
on behalf of the armed forces,

05:16.640 --> 05:22.360
on behalf of the whole country
for your many years of remarkable service.

05:23.840 --> 05:24.920
You are.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.880
You're kicking me out.

05:27.640 --> 05:28.720
[guffaws]

05:29.320 --> 05:32.520
Well, there we are! [chuckles]

05:32.600 --> 05:34.800
Well... [chuckles]

05:35.200 --> 05:37.520
[sighs] There we are.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.800
[King] It's absurd.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.160
That a man
of Lord Mountbatten's achievements,

06:06.240 --> 06:08.640
Supreme Allied Commander
for South East Asia,

06:08.720 --> 06:11.840
one of the chief architects
of the invasion of occupied Europe,

06:11.920 --> 06:14.120
which, incidentally, won us the war,

06:14.200 --> 06:16.480
should be told by a man
who's achieved what?

06:16.800 --> 06:17.760
Nothing.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.360
Broken his promises, crippled the economy,
run this great country into the ground.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.760
...that he, Mountbatten,
is surplus to requirements?

06:25.440 --> 06:26.880
It's not absurd.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.400
-It's obscene.
-[door closes]

06:34.600 --> 06:36.960
But where one door closes,

06:38.840 --> 06:40.560
another opens.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.640
"There is special providence
in such a fall.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.760
If it be now, 'tis not to come;
if it be not to come, it will be now;

06:48.840 --> 06:51.440
if it be not now, yet it will come.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.280
The readiness is all."

07:10.040 --> 07:12.160
What am I going to do, Barratt?

07:12.640 --> 07:14.560
[Barratt] You'll bounce back, sir.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.960
Before long,
you'll have a hundred projects.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.680
Cake, sir.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.160

09:03.840 --> 09:04.760
Hey.

09:05.720 --> 09:06.920
Welcome home, sir.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.840
[distant thunder]

09:56.520 --> 09:57.480
Yes, of course.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.280
I think that should be fine.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.320
I don't think we need to worry
about the stairs.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.440
Pens down, Your Majesty.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.800
Ten minutes to Newmarket.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.720
[Elizabeth] Thank you, Cecil. How is he?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.280
As good as new again.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.640
[Elizabeth] And do you really think
he's recovered from his injury?

10:58.720 --> 11:00.200
[Cecil] I do, ma'am.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.760
Gelded, fired, well rested.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.720
We won't have him
breaking down on us again.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.640
Any chance of seeing him
on the gallops today?

11:09.040 --> 11:12.800
Oh, no, ma'am.
It's too wet and muddy out there.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.880
It's been a lot like this.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.400
Hardly been able to train him at all.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.240
Well, we can't do anything
about the weather.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.080
[commentator]
Now we come to the most anticipated race

11:26.160 --> 11:29.680
of this year's Royal Ascot meeting,
the Queen Alexandra Stakes.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.040
This is Britain's longest flat race,

11:32.120 --> 11:33.840
where stamina is of the essence,

11:33.920 --> 11:36.280
and the favorite is,
of course, number nine,

11:36.760 --> 11:39.360
Her Majesty's own horse, Apprentice.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.760
And they're off with number six, Panic,
taking an early lead,

11:42.840 --> 11:44.680
followed by number one, Valentine's Day,

11:44.760 --> 11:47.320
with number two, Olympic Boy,
breathing down their necks.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.840
They're on the pace now
as they make their start.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.000
Behind them at number ten,
Omphialus, is far off the leaders,

11:54.080 --> 11:57.200
but number nine, Apprentice,
tails behind in fifth place.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.120
A disappointing start for last year's
Yorkshire Cup champion.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.720
And Panic is still ahead, but behind him,
Apprentice is gaining ground,

12:05.800 --> 12:08.800
seeing off a challenge from number seven,
Philemon, and pulling into fourth.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.000
Your Majesty.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.880
-Your Majesty.
-Dickie, darling. Chin up, buttercup.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.360
[commentator]
Apprentice really has the look of eagles.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.240
-Apprentice turns up the pressure...
-Come on!

12:20.320 --> 12:22.360
...on Olympic Boy
as he moves into third place.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.280
And in what is a fantastic recovery
from a slow start,

12:25.360 --> 12:29.280
Apprentice is now level with number two,
Olympic Boy, as they race uphill.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.040
As they come up to the final turn,
Panic leads by a length and a half

12:32.120 --> 12:34.040
but Apprentice is coming through
with a challenge.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.320
Now it's the home straight.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.520
Apprentice is charging down
the near side, digging deep.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.120
Nearly, nearly, nearly...

12:41.200 --> 12:44.360
-No, he hasn't got it.
-No, Apprentice is starting to struggle.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.080
Panic is holding on,
he's holding his lead,

12:46.160 --> 12:49.440
and Apprentice is falling behind
as Valentine's Day pulls back into second.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.080
Olympic Boy coming up from the rear,
and it's a busy finish,

12:53.160 --> 12:55.160
but number six, Panic, finishes first,

12:55.240 --> 12:58.560
and closely followed
by number two Olympic Boy, and...

12:58.640 --> 13:00.320
What are we doing wrong, Porchey?

13:01.040 --> 13:03.960
We used to be at the top.
Now we barely compete.

13:04.440 --> 13:08.880
It's... possible that the system
set up by your late father

13:08.960 --> 13:10.680
is now a little...

13:10.760 --> 13:11.920
Obsolete?

13:12.320 --> 13:14.320
And might need, uh...

13:14.680 --> 13:17.200
Kicking out? Throwing on the dust heap?

13:19.480 --> 13:22.640
If you want to keep up
with the Aga Khans of this world,

13:22.720 --> 13:26.280
I would suggest you follow their lead.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.800
And do what?

13:28.240 --> 13:31.320
Travel round the world and catch up
with all the latest developments.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.960
I can't just do that.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.360
In case you hadn't noticed,
I have a job to do.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.800
It would only be France, not Timbuktu.

13:39.800 --> 13:43.640
There are experienced people who are able
to deputize for you in your absence.

13:53.000 --> 13:53.920
[Wilson] As you know,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.440
this government is committed
to maintaining sterling

13:56.520 --> 13:58.320
at $2.80 to the pound.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.960
But with every economic blow,

14:01.040 --> 14:04.040
the oil embargo,
the balance of payments deficit,

14:04.600 --> 14:06.720
and the Dockers' Union strike,

14:06.800 --> 14:09.720
it's proving harder and harder
to maintain.

14:23.600 --> 14:28.600
And I'm afraid that now we have
no alternative but to devalue the pound.

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
Oh.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.920
[Wilson] And I need hardly say
it is a matter of overwhelming regret

14:36.600 --> 14:37.960
for me personally.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.880
And a humiliation for the government.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.160
It feels like a bad time to say that
I won't be here for our meeting next week.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.840
Perhaps the next two weeks.

14:51.800 --> 14:55.160
But Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother,
will step in as counsellor of state.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.800
Uh... Oh.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.080
[Elizabeth]
A role she's executed many times.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.120
[bell rings]

15:08.000 --> 15:09.160
Your Majesty.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.120
[door opens]

15:21.680 --> 15:22.800
[door closes]

15:25.760 --> 15:26.760
[Wilson] Good evening.

15:27.520 --> 15:33.040
A few days ago, the Cabinet took its
unanimous decision to devalue the pound.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.160
I can now tell you

15:35.240 --> 15:36.520
why we have taken this action,

15:36.600 --> 15:39.920
and, more importantly,
what it will mean for you.

15:40.600 --> 15:45.120
From now on, the pound abroad
will be worth 14% or so less

15:45.200 --> 15:46.960
in terms of other currencies.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.360
Now, this doesn't mean, of course,

15:49.440 --> 15:51.000
that the pound here in Britain

15:51.080 --> 15:54.160
in your pocket or your purse
or your bank has been devalued.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.520
What it does mean is that the goods
we buy from abroad will be dearer.

15:59.240 --> 16:02.560
So, for many goods,
it will be cheaper to buy British.

16:04.840 --> 16:08.960
Now, this devaluation
has been a hard decision,

16:09.440 --> 16:13.000
and some of its consequences
will be hard for a time.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.440
[chuckles]

16:14.520 --> 16:17.280
[Wilson] For three years,
this government has fought,

16:17.360 --> 16:19.560
as it was our duty to fight,

16:19.640 --> 16:22.960
the burden of the deficit
that the previous government left us with.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.240
But now is not the time
to attribute blame.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.720
Now is our chance to break free
from that straitjacket,

16:30.480 --> 16:33.960
to seize this opportunity
with both hands.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.680
This is a proud nation.
We're out on our own now.

16:40.080 --> 16:45.040
Now we must choose to put Britain first.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.440
[sighs]

17:06.720 --> 17:11.040
[Mountbatten] Tonight,
we veterans of the Burma campaign

17:11.120 --> 17:14.320
are gathered here
to renew old comradeships

17:15.200 --> 17:17.160
and to remember fallen brothers

17:17.720 --> 17:20.720
at Yenangyaung and Rangoon.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.640
We remember how it was fought.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.040
The old way, the honorable way.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.160
[audience murmurs]

17:28.240 --> 17:30.760
Body to body, bayonet to bayonet.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.600
[scattered applause]

17:32.680 --> 17:35.680
And that swift,
exhilarating sweep of victory

17:35.760 --> 17:39.840
that carried us over the Irrawaddy
and into Mandalay.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.240
And there we met the Japanese army,

17:44.000 --> 17:45.680
and we tore it apart.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.760
[cheering]

17:49.040 --> 17:50.600
Yes, gentlemen,

17:50.680 --> 17:54.880
we military men will always have
our past glories to look back on.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.440
But what of this new generation?

17:59.520 --> 18:03.560
These young men and women for whom
some of the best of us gave our lives.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.720
[man] Hear, hear.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.080
[Mountbatten] Decline,

18:06.720 --> 18:11.240
irrelevance,
and the devaluation of pound sterling.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.640
That is the sunless future
that faces them.

18:15.480 --> 18:20.600
For them, the white heat of revolution
is not a forging heat.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.600
It is a melting heat.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.920
It melts the silver of our battle honors

18:26.640 --> 18:32.080
and reduces to cinders the very foundation
of our economy, our currency.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.560
-[man 1] Yes.
-[man 2] Hear, hear.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
[Mountbatten] So...

18:37.800 --> 18:43.520
if the only glories available
to this nation are its past glories,

18:44.440 --> 18:46.520
then let us cherish them now.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.560
[audience] Hear, hear.

18:50.680 --> 18:54.760
"Come you back, you British soldier,
come you back..."

18:58.360 --> 18:59.600
Who will join me?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.560
[audience murmurs]

19:01.640 --> 19:04.600
"Ship me somewhere east of Suez,

19:05.280 --> 19:07.680
where the best is like the worst,

19:08.400 --> 19:11.040
Where there are no Ten Commandments

19:11.520 --> 19:14.000
and a man can raise a thirst,

19:14.680 --> 19:16.960
For the temple bells are calling,

19:17.440 --> 19:19.640
and it's there that I would be

19:20.240 --> 19:22.640
By the old Moulmein Pagoda,

19:23.240 --> 19:25.320
looking lazy at the sea.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.800
[audience joins in]
On the road to Mandalay,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.320
Where the old flotilla lay,

19:33.160 --> 19:35.880
with our sick beneath the awnings

19:37.080 --> 19:39.320
when we went to Mandalay.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.920
O' the road to Mandalay,

19:44.400 --> 19:46.680
Where the flying-fishes play,

19:47.680 --> 19:50.480
And the dawn comes up like thunder

19:51.400 --> 19:54.400
out of China 'crost the Bay."

19:54.480 --> 19:56.480
[cheering]

20:03.880 --> 20:05.040
What do you think?

20:06.640 --> 20:07.720
Very good.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.840
-Lord Mountbatten?
-Excuse me.

20:26.920 --> 20:27.840
Cecil King.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.680
I hoped to talk to you, sir,

20:29.760 --> 20:33.360
to express my sympathy at the way
you've been treated by the government.

20:33.560 --> 20:37.360
A shameful piece of
political grandstanding and opportunism.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.240
You're very kind.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.080
[King] Well, this country needs great men
more than ever

20:42.160 --> 20:44.320
to restore confidence, inspire us,

20:44.400 --> 20:47.920
and perhaps even lead us out of the mire.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.800
Well, it's been made very clear to me
that my leadership days are over.

20:51.880 --> 20:55.600
[King] Oh, well, my colleagues
and I don't believe that, sir.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.280
Not for a minute.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.680
As a matter of fact,

20:58.760 --> 21:02.760
we'd be delighted if you would have lunch
with us at Threadneedle Street one day.

21:02.840 --> 21:03.720
Bank of England?

21:04.320 --> 21:09.040
We've been working on a proposal,
which we'd very much like to put to you.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.600
Hmm.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.440
Sir.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.600
-[chickens cluck]
-[girls speak French]

21:27.880 --> 21:29.080
[horn blares]

21:35.760 --> 21:37.600
-Hello.
-[in French] Your Majesty.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.680
Welcome to Haras du Quesnay.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.440
[in French] Thank you, Mr. Head.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.160
But there is no need for such formality.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.920
In the world of breeding,
it is you who are king.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.080
[chuckles] You are very kind, ma'am,
and very indulgent.

21:50.160 --> 21:53.120
I suspect you are flattering me.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.040
-[in English] Hello, Alec.
-Henry.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.360
[in French] Shall we? Good morning.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.880
[in English] And, of course,
it was Malin Comme un Singe

22:03.960 --> 22:07.480
who came out of Lady Danjar,
a magnificent stayer.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.680
Oh! And his grandsire, White Settler.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.560
Oh, that's right.
We had tremendous success with him.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.840
Yes, I remember him. A wonderful sprinter.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.520
-Are these your stud books?
-[man] Indeed, ma'am.

22:18.600 --> 22:22.320
And I think you will find
some very familiar names in there.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.800
Yes, I bet I will.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.000
If I'm not mistaken...

22:26.800 --> 22:28.600
-this one.
-Oh, gosh, yes.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.960
My grandfather's, one of his favorites.

22:32.440 --> 22:35.240
-What would you say? Six months?
-[Porchey] Mm, yes, I'd say so.

22:35.320 --> 22:38.400
Nice temperament,
warm-blooded, not too skittish.

22:38.480 --> 22:42.120
-Indeed. Look at her hocks.
-Oh, yes.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.720
Very well proportioned,
excellent line to the back.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.160
[Porchey] Yes.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.760
May I?

22:55.400 --> 22:57.120
[Elizabeth] It was extraordinary.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.200
Not just their facilities,
their entire attitude to breeding,

23:01.280 --> 23:04.400
but the fact they keep their foals
and their yearlings so close...

23:04.480 --> 23:05.400
[Porchey] Merci.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.720
...while we send ours off
to graze in Ireland.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.320
Tell me honestly. Is it over?

23:12.720 --> 23:14.280
Have we slipped too far behind?

23:14.680 --> 23:15.880
Not yet, ma'am.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.880
But if you want to keep up,

23:17.960 --> 23:20.320
you, uh, you do need
to act decisively now.

23:20.920 --> 23:25.640
It'd mean rethinking the operation
from top to toe, changing the personnel,

23:25.720 --> 23:26.960
-changing the approach.
-Yes.

23:27.040 --> 23:31.320
And currently there is a drain of the best
British racehorses to America.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.200
You have to ask yourself... why?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.320
You don't think I should go there, too?

23:37.400 --> 23:40.120
Obviously, from a racing perspective,
it will be ideal.

23:40.880 --> 23:45.480
Just for a day or two, but, uh...
won't you be needed at home?

23:46.640 --> 23:48.080
Well, they've always got Mummy.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.320
Me being away is good for her.

23:50.400 --> 23:54.120
She hates feeling old and superannuated
and surplus to requirements.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.280
I'm sure she's relishing
being the big chief again.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.960
[both chuckle]

24:01.760 --> 24:02.760
Hmm.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.400
-Thank you.
-Sir.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.400
-Mr. King.
-Lord Mountbatten.

24:20.520 --> 24:24.160
[King] The Great Britain of our childhood
is dying before us.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.760
The country is bankrupt,
our national security is in tatters,

24:28.840 --> 24:30.840
our allies are in despair.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.600
And on our current trajectory, by 1970,

24:34.680 --> 24:37.400
we will be a vassal state.

24:37.480 --> 24:38.720
A pariah.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.200
I don't know about you, sir,

24:41.280 --> 24:44.880
but I'd sooner die than stand idly by
and watch this happen.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.600
And to that end,

24:46.680 --> 24:49.600
my associates and I
have come up with a plan

24:49.680 --> 24:51.640
to put the country back on track.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.080
Which is?

24:55.520 --> 24:57.720
Replacing the Prime Minister

24:58.160 --> 25:01.480
and installing a new emergency government.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.720
-What?
-And in his place,

25:03.800 --> 25:07.400
we would need to install
an inspirational figurehead.

25:07.480 --> 25:11.080
Someone who could unite the nation,
command its respect.

25:11.160 --> 25:15.160
Someone who had stepped
into a national leadership role before.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.520
Now, there are some obvious candidates,

25:17.600 --> 25:19.720
but, frankly,
none would be as good as you, sir.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.800
No, no, no, this is quite unthinkable.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.760
At this point, I should close my ears.

25:27.160 --> 25:28.240
[clears throat]

25:28.320 --> 25:32.160
Despite my own very profound reservations
regarding our prime minister,

25:32.240 --> 25:35.200
what you're talking about
is effectively a coup.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.640
And I can have nothing whatsoever
to do with it.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.560
[King] In peacetime, it's true,

25:40.640 --> 25:44.240
an intervention like this
would be unconstitutional.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.600
But we believe
this is no longer peacetime,

25:49.280 --> 25:53.920
and the circumstances are unprecedented
and quite exceptional.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.160
Gerald.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.840
[Gerald]
In order to hijack control of the economy,

26:00.920 --> 26:04.640
Wilson and his socialist colleagues
have devised a plan,

26:05.320 --> 26:06.680
Plan Brutus,

26:07.560 --> 26:10.560
which would strip the Bank of England
of all its powers,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.800
freeze the sterling balances
of foreign governments,

26:14.320 --> 26:17.840
and enforce crash cuts
in defense spending.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.880
[Benn] The bankers cannot be allowed
to run the show.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.560
The Bank of England has known

26:22.640 --> 26:25.360
about gold pouring out of the country
since Monday

26:25.440 --> 26:28.520
-and has done nothing to stop it.
-What is our response?

26:28.600 --> 26:30.880
[Thomson]
The imposition of exchange controls,

26:31.320 --> 26:33.320
crash cuts in defense expenditure,

26:33.400 --> 26:38.320
and the compulsory acquisition
of all privately held overseas securities.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.640
Show of hands.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.240
[lawyer]
It is an effective declaration of war

26:47.680 --> 26:50.240
on freedom, democracy, and capitalism.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.040
[King] We must act now.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.160
Not just to save Britain, but the world.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.040
We are proposing a radical revolution

27:00.120 --> 27:03.160
led by bankers, businessmen,
and the armed forces.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.440
Professionals who can save us
from amateurism,

27:05.520 --> 27:08.160
incompetence, and Russian infiltration.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.400
And as our interim leader,

27:12.280 --> 27:15.080
we can think of
no one better than you, sir.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.400
[inhales then exhales deeply]

27:28.000 --> 27:29.600
This is all very interesting.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.240
[taps fingers]

27:34.320 --> 27:36.520
May I suggest that we meet again...

27:38.560 --> 27:39.800
in 48 hours?

27:42.440 --> 27:43.400
Sir.

27:51.880 --> 27:55.560
[presenter] With the pound down and
the rest later, I suppose that sums it up.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.960
Devaluation and a gigantic loan
that we'll all have to pay back.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.200
Britain now finds itself

28:00.280 --> 28:02.840
looking at a complete reversal
of government policy

28:02.920 --> 28:05.640
after three years
of devaluation and denial.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.280
[crowd]
Wilson must go! Wilson must go!

28:08.360 --> 28:11.120
[presenter] Outside 10 Downing Street,
protesters gathered

28:11.200 --> 28:13.280
as the reality
of what a devalued pound...

28:30.800 --> 28:33.080
Welcome to the Commonwealth of Kentucky,
Your Majesty.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.680
-Thank you, Mr. Hancock.
-Please, call me Bull.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.880
Sorry we don't have
better weather for you.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.920
It's quite all right.
We like a good watering.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.680
-Bull Hancock.
-Pleasure to meet you.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.800
[presenter] Your shopping basket
will hold less for the same money.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.480
A whole lot of imported foodstuffs
will cost more,

28:47.560 --> 28:50.000
around threepence a pound more for beef.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.240
-This the one?
-Excellent.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.440
[presenter]
On Monday, after the announcement,

28:54.520 --> 28:55.800
the Stock Exchange was empty.

28:55.880 --> 28:57.040
There was no trading.

28:57.120 --> 29:01.040
But outside in Throgmorton Street,
brokers and jobbers crowded together

29:01.120 --> 29:03.120
to try and sort out
what the drop in the pound...

29:05.560 --> 29:06.760
[Hancock] Morning, boys.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.200
-Morning, sir.
-Morning, Mr. Hancock.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.480
[Hancock] They're testing for minerals.
Sulfur, calcium.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.480
Correct nutrition is vital, ma'am,

29:14.560 --> 29:17.120
when it comes to the bone strength
and bone formation

29:17.200 --> 29:19.320
-in the foals we're raising.
-Yes, sir.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.640
-[Hancock] Tommy's one of the best.
-[Tommy] Thank you, sir.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.760
-Does Tommy ever come to England?
-Oh, no, no, no.

29:23.840 --> 29:24.760
Oh.

29:25.440 --> 29:28.720
[presenter] Paris woke up to find
that France was on the brink of civil war.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.640
Would the rebel generals in Algeria
send paratroopers?

29:31.960 --> 29:34.600
Defense measures
were quickly put into operation.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.240
Orly Airport was closed
to flights in and out.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.800
Nobody in the capital knew
the rebels' intentions,

29:43.880 --> 29:46.320
but plastic bomb outrages
here and elsewhere

29:46.400 --> 29:49.360
showed that pro-rebel sympathizers
were on the prowl.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.600
They struck
at the Gare de Lyon railway terminus

29:52.680 --> 29:54.280
and at the Austerlitz station,

29:54.360 --> 29:56.560
not with any serious effect,
but it was...

29:56.640 --> 30:00.160
[Hancock] These are veterinary students
we've invited to spend time at the farm.

30:00.760 --> 30:04.000
They learn reproductive management,
neonatal and foal management,

30:04.080 --> 30:05.600
herd health management.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.400
What we're aiming for
is better integration

30:08.480 --> 30:10.280
between our practices here at the stud

30:10.360 --> 30:13.760
and the clinical research
being conducted in the wider world.

30:16.960 --> 30:20.480
-[Elizabeth] Remind me of the year.
-[Porchey] 1967. Why?

30:20.880 --> 30:24.360
'Cause having seen what I've just seen,
one might think it 2067.

30:25.080 --> 30:28.080
In terms of technology,
and their management of the pasture,

30:28.360 --> 30:30.720
and their willingness
to embrace new ideas,

30:30.800 --> 30:33.920
the Americans aren't just on a different
level, they're on a different planet.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.080
And their racing manager,
wasn't he impressive?

30:37.160 --> 30:39.280
When you think about Cecil
by comparison...

30:39.360 --> 30:41.960
-Yes, he is getting on now.
-Hmm, 150.

30:42.040 --> 30:46.360
Well, not quite that, but certainly 80.
Dear old Cecil.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.800
The Ben-Hur of Newmarket.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.480
[both chuckle]

30:49.560 --> 30:51.560
He had such success with your father.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.280
And grandfather.
You know he was wounded at the Somme?

30:54.360 --> 30:58.360
Yes. So, it's probably time
for someone a little bit younger.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.440
The question is, who is there?

31:01.440 --> 31:03.480
What about... Gordon Richards?

31:03.880 --> 31:06.280
He's with the Weinstocks.
They'd never let him go.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.960
-Or... David McCall?
-Hmm.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.760
He's good.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.720
But can you honestly see him fitting in?

31:16.080 --> 31:17.800
-No.
-Try that.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.200
Oh.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Mmm.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.600
Would you ever consider it?

31:33.240 --> 31:35.000
-Me?
-Why not?

31:35.080 --> 31:37.640
You're brilliant,
and you know the family inside out.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.240
Well, I'm honored.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.480
-But I'm also very ambitious, so...
-Hmm.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.640
I could never accept unless I felt sure

31:47.720 --> 31:50.800
we had every chance of success
at the highest level.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.440
And in terms of our research,

31:53.520 --> 31:56.280
there's still one thing
that we really need to see.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.680
-What?
-Their training facilities.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.080
If we're going to gain the edge,

32:01.160 --> 32:03.280
there's still a lot to learn
from the Americans.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.840
Porchey, how much longer
is that going to take?

32:07.120 --> 32:08.080
Well...

32:10.040 --> 32:11.200
[chuckles]

32:12.120 --> 32:14.040
-[Porchey] Do you want to try this?
-Yes, please.

32:41.640 --> 32:42.840
[Mountbatten] Gentlemen.

32:43.680 --> 32:47.640
In the past decade alone,
there have, by my reckoning,

32:47.720 --> 32:52.760
been 73 coups in 46 different countries
around the world,

32:53.200 --> 32:56.800
and the success of some of these
might encourage us.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.600
In Ghana two years ago,

32:59.680 --> 33:03.200
President Nkrumah
was ousted with just 500 men.

33:04.280 --> 33:06.440
And in 1961 in South Korea,

33:06.520 --> 33:12.320
Major General Park Chung-hee
seized power with 3,500 men.

33:13.680 --> 33:16.480
And in 1964 in Gabon,

33:17.080 --> 33:21.560
just 150 men were able
to arrest President M'ba

33:21.640 --> 33:25.440
and thus gain control
over the levers of state power.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.400
And, of course,
it was with just one legion

33:28.480 --> 33:30.480
that Caesar crossed the Rubicon.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.880
And perhaps we would not seek
to follow his fate.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.960
Sic semper tyrannis, gentlemen.

33:38.040 --> 33:39.240
[chuckling]

33:39.320 --> 33:42.560
And what all successful insurgencies
have in common

33:43.240 --> 33:45.240
are five key elements.

33:45.800 --> 33:49.160
Control of the media,
control of the economy,

33:49.240 --> 33:51.800
and the capture of administrative targets,

33:51.880 --> 33:56.160
for which you need the fourth element,
the loyalty of the military.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.480
Now, in Ghana and Gabon,

33:58.560 --> 34:01.320
this can be achieved
with a handful of battalions,

34:01.400 --> 34:03.840
but here in the United Kingdom...

34:05.880 --> 34:08.080
we would need to secure Parliament,

34:09.040 --> 34:10.080
Whitehall,

34:10.800 --> 34:13.240
the Ministry of Defence,
and the Cabinet Office.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.360
The Prime Minister
will be arrested, of course,

34:16.440 --> 34:18.800
along with other politicians still loyal.

34:18.880 --> 34:22.520
We would have to shut down
the airports, air traffic control.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.520
Same with the train stations.

34:24.600 --> 34:28.480
Curfews will be put in place,
martial law declared.

34:28.720 --> 34:30.920
And I haven't even mentioned the police.

34:32.480 --> 34:36.840
It would take tens of thousands
of unquestioningly loyal servicemen,

34:37.320 --> 34:40.560
and even in my heyday,
I could never command that.

34:42.160 --> 34:44.160
Which brings me to the fifth element.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.160
Legitimacy.

34:47.720 --> 34:49.960
Now, our government draws its strength

34:50.040 --> 34:53.240
from long-established institutions
that support it.

34:53.720 --> 34:58.640
The courts, body of common law,
the constitution.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.720
For any action against the state
to succeed,

35:01.800 --> 35:03.520
you'd have to overthrow these as well.

35:04.520 --> 35:08.040
But in a highly evolved democracy
such as ours,

35:08.120 --> 35:10.480
their authority is sacrosanct.

35:12.760 --> 35:17.960
Which is why, gentlemen,
a coup d'état in the United Kingdom...

35:19.120 --> 35:21.320
doesn't stand a chance.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.600
Unless...

35:31.920 --> 35:33.560
Unless...?

35:34.560 --> 35:38.320
[Mountbatten] Unless we had the support
of the one person not yet mentioned.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.120
Do you see the temperament?

35:42.920 --> 35:48.440
[Mountbatten] The Crown has at
its disposal unique constitutional powers

35:48.520 --> 35:51.640
which could still make
something like this possible.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.640
In 1834, William IV used them

35:54.720 --> 35:58.040
to dismiss his government
in the face of opposition from the House.

35:59.160 --> 36:02.600
And in 1920,
the Emergency Powers Act was passed,

36:03.440 --> 36:06.880
which gave the sovereign power
in certain circumstances

36:06.960 --> 36:10.240
to declare
a state of emergency by proclamation.

36:10.320 --> 36:13.480
Meaning our Queen
could dissolve Parliament

36:14.240 --> 36:18.040
and appoint a new government,
and a prime minister as well.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.560
She's also Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces.

36:22.120 --> 36:25.160
They swear allegiance to her
and not to Parliament,

36:25.240 --> 36:28.280
so could count on their support
to see it through.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.000
She is our Caesar.

36:34.080 --> 36:35.480
[music plays over dialogue]

36:39.440 --> 36:42.720
[King] And you think
she might entertain this idea?

36:42.800 --> 36:45.360
The circumstances
are certainly compelling.

36:45.440 --> 36:48.880
Now, I've made a list here
of exactly how compelling.

36:49.960 --> 36:54.080
And as her second cousin,
I am in an ideal position to ask.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.160
-Not hungry?
-No.

37:10.600 --> 37:14.160
Somehow today has managed to be
one of the most enjoyable days of my life.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.720
And at the same time,
one of the most depressing.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.240
[knocking at door]

37:21.840 --> 37:23.800
Telephone call for you, ma'am.
Lord Mountbatten.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.320
I'll call him back.

37:30.600 --> 37:31.880
[door closes]

37:33.880 --> 37:36.440
If I tell you something,
do you promise it will stay between us?

37:36.520 --> 37:37.520
Of course.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.920
This is how I'd like to spend all my time.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.080
[chuckles]

37:45.480 --> 37:48.720
Owning horses,
breeding horses, racing horses.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.960
It's what makes me truly happy.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.680
And I actually think
it's what I was born to do,

37:55.960 --> 37:57.840
until the other thing came along...

37:58.880 --> 38:02.400
that someone else was born to do,
that they elected not to do,

38:02.480 --> 38:04.720
which meant that first my father,
and then I,

38:04.800 --> 38:06.680
had to do a job we were never meant to do.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.000
Well, you've managed to make it look like

38:11.080 --> 38:14.000
the other thing is the only thing
you were ever meant to do.

38:15.480 --> 38:17.640
Hmm. You're kind.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.520
But it isn't.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.240
And on days like today...

38:38.000 --> 38:41.520
in places like this,
in company like this...

38:43.080 --> 38:45.760
you get a glimpse
of what it all might have been like.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.600
The unlived life...

38:52.880 --> 38:55.080
and how much happier
it might have made me.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.880
-[knocking at door]
-Not now!

39:07.240 --> 39:08.480
Oh, dear. Did I just snap?

39:08.560 --> 39:10.400
-Slightly.
-I shall have to grovel now.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.320
-No, it's all right. He'll understand.
-[knocking at door]

39:13.400 --> 39:16.640
-[Charteris] I'm so sorry, Your Majesty.
-Yes, all right, I'm coming.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.120
Honestly, only Dickie.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.880
[door opens]

39:25.720 --> 39:27.720
Yes, thank you, Martin. I'll talk to him.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.240
[sighs]

39:47.600 --> 39:48.840
[Charteris] Your Majesty.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.720
You are persistent.
Is it really so important?

39:59.520 --> 40:00.680
Yes, Your Majesty.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.280
Prime Minister?

40:05.560 --> 40:08.040
Ma'am, I have reason to believe

40:08.120 --> 40:12.320
there is currently a full-blown plot
developing against me

40:12.400 --> 40:15.080
and the democratically elected
Labour government

40:15.160 --> 40:17.000
that governs in your name

40:17.760 --> 40:20.760
being led
by a senior member of your family.

40:21.560 --> 40:22.520
Who?

40:25.160 --> 40:26.560
Lord Mountbatten.

40:27.080 --> 40:30.280
And that he, in cahoots with Cecil King,

40:30.360 --> 40:32.360
the chairman
of the Mirror Group newspapers,

40:32.440 --> 40:35.680
has been attempting
to overthrow this government.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.280
Now, I feel compelled
to remind Your Majesty

40:41.360 --> 40:45.520
that tolerance of the royal family
is hanging by a thread as it is.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.720
And throughout my time in office,

40:50.440 --> 40:52.760
I have done my level best to protect you.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.800
But if members of the royal family

40:57.360 --> 41:00.200
were to interfere with
the political business of the day,

41:00.280 --> 41:01.920
I would be left with no option

41:02.000 --> 41:06.200
but to side with the republican elements
of my Cabinet,

41:06.280 --> 41:09.760
which I have successfully controlled
until now...

41:12.320 --> 41:13.960
and take steps.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.560
Leave it with me, Prime Minister.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.040
Your Majesty. [hangs up]

42:06.640 --> 42:07.960
[door opens]

42:15.680 --> 42:16.960
Drink up, Porchey.

42:17.720 --> 42:18.920
We're going home.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.720
[reporters shout questions]

42:58.000 --> 42:59.600
Lord Mountbatten, Your Majesty.

43:10.560 --> 43:11.560
Your Majesty.

43:17.480 --> 43:18.960
You asked to see me.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.720
I did.

43:20.800 --> 43:23.200
[Mountbatten]
Well, great minds think alike.

43:23.280 --> 43:25.920
As it happens,
I was planning to drop by myself...

43:29.120 --> 43:30.640
on a matter of great importance.

43:41.800 --> 43:45.280
I'm getting a feeling
that I've not had since Dieppe,

43:46.400 --> 43:48.160
that I'm walking into a trap.

43:51.120 --> 43:53.080
I'd like to think you had
that sinking feeling

43:53.160 --> 43:54.760
on another occasion recently,

43:55.600 --> 43:57.800
when going to see your friends
at the Bank of England.

43:59.680 --> 44:00.800
Is it even true?

44:02.440 --> 44:05.360
Yes, I did go to lunch
at the Bank of England

44:05.440 --> 44:06.840
to meet and listen to people

44:06.920 --> 44:09.920
who are horrified
by what's happening to the country.

44:10.920 --> 44:12.880
A horror I hope you share.

44:12.960 --> 44:13.960
Perhaps.

44:14.640 --> 44:17.040
But conspiring with them
is not the solution.

44:17.120 --> 44:19.000
[Mountbatten]
It is the beginning of a solution.

44:21.640 --> 44:25.200
Why are you doing this?
Why would you protect a man like Wilson?

44:34.200 --> 44:36.800
I am protecting the Prime Minister.

44:37.880 --> 44:39.880
I am protecting the constitution.

44:40.840 --> 44:43.080
I am protecting democracy.

44:45.080 --> 44:48.560
But if the man at the heart
of that democracy threatens to destroy it,

44:48.640 --> 44:50.840
are we supposed to just stand by
and do nothing?

44:51.080 --> 44:52.080
Yes.

44:52.680 --> 44:56.520
Doing nothing is exactly what we do,
and bide our time,

44:56.600 --> 44:59.760
and wait for the people that voted him in
to vote him out again,

44:59.840 --> 45:02.800
if indeed that is what they decide to do.

45:04.920 --> 45:06.080
Mm-hmm.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.160
[clears throat]

45:22.000 --> 45:24.240
I'm sure you find it near impossible
to do nothing

45:25.120 --> 45:28.480
and to not have the role
and responsibilities you've always had.

45:29.440 --> 45:32.160
You were born to be busy and to lead.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.120
But you still have
a huge role to play in this family.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.640
A father figure to my husband.

45:40.560 --> 45:42.560
An uncle and a guide to me.

45:43.480 --> 45:48.320
A king to make in Charles,
not to mention a brother to your sister.

45:49.880 --> 45:52.040
When was the last time
you even visited her?

45:52.640 --> 45:53.720
Cheered her up?

46:00.520 --> 46:02.720
That would be a greater service
to the Crown

46:02.800 --> 46:05.280
than leading unconstitutional coups.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.200
Hmm.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.680
[clock ticks]

46:47.360 --> 46:49.040
[coughing]

47:03.880 --> 47:05.120
[door closes]

47:05.200 --> 47:07.200
[footsteps approach]

47:10.280 --> 47:12.240
Nice of you to find the time.

47:12.320 --> 47:15.680
Hmm! These days, I've nothing but time.

47:17.160 --> 47:19.000
And too little time.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.200
[sighs]

47:25.840 --> 47:26.840
Hmm.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.280
The four of us.

47:32.360 --> 47:34.440
-What?
-The four of us.

47:38.080 --> 47:39.360
Look at us now.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.080
Only two left.

47:42.520 --> 47:45.080
You're left, not me.

47:45.600 --> 47:46.840
I'm on the way out.

47:47.160 --> 47:48.360
Nonsense.

47:49.960 --> 47:53.920
There came a moment
around the time I turned 70...

47:55.000 --> 47:59.160
when it dawned on me
that I was no longer a participant,

47:59.240 --> 48:01.480
rather a spectator.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.320
I've discovered that for myself.

48:04.400 --> 48:07.520
Then it's just a matter of waiting

48:08.240 --> 48:11.280
and not getting in the way.

48:14.080 --> 48:15.440
-[coughs]
-[lighter clicks]

48:16.040 --> 48:17.040
[lighter clicks]

48:20.560 --> 48:23.400
I hear you have been getting in the way.

48:23.480 --> 48:25.640
-[coughs]
-Who told you that?

48:25.720 --> 48:29.280
-There are no secrets in this place!
-Hmm.

48:29.800 --> 48:34.080
Did you get a dressing down
from our doughty Queen?

48:35.200 --> 48:38.800
-Yes, I did.
-[guffaws]

48:38.880 --> 48:39.920
Oh, what's so funny?

48:40.480 --> 48:42.000
Well, that's funny.

48:43.040 --> 48:47.320
The little girl admonishing
the grand old Admiral of the Fleet.

48:47.400 --> 48:49.080
Well, I'm glad it amuses you.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.320
Because the situation
this country is facing

48:52.400 --> 48:54.400
is anything but amusing.

48:57.080 --> 48:58.080
Oh...

48:59.000 --> 49:02.400
Who cares? Honestly.

49:04.920 --> 49:09.000
One of the few joys
of being as old as we both are

49:09.640 --> 49:11.840
is that it's not our problem.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.920
It's not really our country, either.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.720
What are you talking about?

49:16.800 --> 49:18.600
Of course it's our country.

49:18.680 --> 49:21.840
We Battenbergs have no country.

49:23.800 --> 49:27.480
Our family might have kings
and queens in its ranks,

49:28.120 --> 49:30.600
but we're mongrels, too.

49:32.120 --> 49:36.080
Part-German, part-Greek,
part-nowhere at all.

49:37.720 --> 49:40.680
Well, this is my country.

49:43.320 --> 49:45.800
It gave me a home, it gave me a name,

49:47.880 --> 49:50.200
and in return, I've given it my life.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.280
And to see it like this breaks my heart.

50:34.320 --> 50:35.320
You must sleep.

50:38.480 --> 50:39.480
Sister.

50:50.240 --> 50:54.400
Princess Alice of Nowhere at All.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.360
[footsteps approach]

52:18.160 --> 52:19.160
You.

52:20.320 --> 52:23.800
-Don't sound so surprised.
-[Philip] I am. It's been so long.

52:27.920 --> 52:30.840
So, how was France and America?

52:32.280 --> 52:33.320
Educational.

52:34.800 --> 52:38.400
Oh. The trip was supposed to be a week.
You were gone almost a month.

52:38.480 --> 52:39.480
[Elizabeth] Yes.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.080
With Porchey?

52:43.160 --> 52:44.160
Yes.

52:46.480 --> 52:47.680
Was that fun?

52:49.720 --> 52:53.520
We went on racing business.
It was a fact-finding expedition.

52:54.200 --> 52:55.080
Right.

52:56.520 --> 52:58.560
[Elizabeth]
If you have something to say, say it now.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.360
Otherwise, if you don't mind, I'm busy.

53:00.440 --> 53:02.880
I've heard you've appointed him
as your racing manager.

53:02.960 --> 53:05.280
-I have.
-Which means he'll be around all the time.

53:05.360 --> 53:06.360
Yes, with any luck.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.920
-Good for you.
-Good for all of us.

53:49.880 --> 53:51.400
I... heard about Dickie.

53:52.800 --> 53:54.840
-A coup.
-Yes. Can you believe it?

53:57.520 --> 53:59.320
It must be hard getting old.

54:05.800 --> 54:06.800
Yes.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.080
I'll be up in a minute.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.000
Oh, will you?

54:23.720 --> 54:24.920
Yes, I thought so.

54:26.160 --> 54:27.640
Unless you'd rather I wasn't.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.400
I'll see you in a minute.
