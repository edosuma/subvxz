00:39.439 --> 00:41.941
HAS BEEN A VERY BUSY WEEK,

00:54.454 --> 00:56.823
AMPLIFIED BY HOSTS ON FOX.

04:51.357 --> 04:53.159
CHIEF WAS THE ONE GETTING YELLED

04:53.159 --> 04:54.961
AT WAS BECAUSE NO ONE FROM

05:13.846 --> 05:14.747

05:24.190 --> 05:25.725
TELLING REPORTERS ABOUT THIS

05:26.659 --> 05:28.161
CBS NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT

05:28.161 --> 05:29.562
SOME OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES

05:29.562 --> 05:31.297
HAD PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED CONCERN

05:31.297 --> 05:34.434
OVER THE EXCESSIVE SIZE AND

05:34.434 --> 05:36.469
WEIGHT OF THE 151-CAR TRAIN,

05:36.469 --> 05:39.439
WHICH WAS 9,300 FEET LONG AND

05:39.439 --> 05:41.874
WEIGHED 18,000 TONS.

05:41.874 --> 05:43.476
THEY SAY IT HAD SUFFERED AT

05:43.476 --> 05:45.878
LEAST ONE BREAKDOWN ON ITS ROUTE

05:45.878 --> 05:47.480
BEFORE IT DERAILED IN EAST

05:47.480 --> 05:48.281
PALESTINE.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.615
John: THAT'S NOT GREAT!

05:49.615 --> 05:50.850
AND IT SHOULD SAY SOMETHING THAT

05:50.850 --> 05:52.318
EMPLOYEES WERE RAISING CONCERNS

05:52.318 --> 05:54.387
ABOUT THE 18,000 TON COMBUSTIBLE

05:54.387 --> 05:56.022
CENTIPEDE THAT THE COMPANY WAS

05:56.022 --> 05:57.323
OPERATING.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.025
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU

05:59.025 --> 06:00.326
CAN JUST BRUSH OFF, LIKE ME

06:00.326 --> 06:01.828
BEING TOLD, "I THINK YOU SHOULD

06:01.828 --> 06:03.229
SHOW YOUR PARENT COMPANY A

06:03.229 --> 06:04.197
LITTLE MORE RESPECT."

06:04.197 --> 06:05.631
I'LL DO THAT IF YOU CAN TELL ME

06:05.631 --> 06:06.866
WHO THE FUCK IT ACTUALLY IS

06:06.866 --> 06:08.167
RIGHT NOW.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.535
THEN I'LL GIVE MY DEADBEAT

06:09.535 --> 06:12.071
BUSINESS DADDY THE EXACT AMOUNT

06:12.071 --> 06:13.606
OF RESPECT THEY DESERVE.

06:13.606 --> 06:14.574
AND TROUBLINGLY, THIS IS PART OF

06:14.574 --> 06:16.609
A LARGER TREND OF TRAINS GETTING

06:16.609 --> 06:18.244
LONGER AND HEAVIER, EVEN AS

06:18.244 --> 06:20.046
COMPANIES HAVE OPERATED WITH

06:20.046 --> 06:21.447
SMALLER STAFFS.

06:21.447 --> 06:22.749
AND WORKERS HAVE CLAIMED THIS

06:22.749 --> 06:23.416
WAS WIDELY KNOWN AS A DIFFICULT

06:23.416 --> 06:24.517
TRAIN TO RUN.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.085
AND THAT, WHILE ITS OFFICIAL

06:26.085 --> 06:28.321
NAME WAS 32N, IT HAD A NICKNAME

06:28.321 --> 06:29.589
AMONG SOME RAIL WORKERS OF

06:29.589 --> 06:31.858
"32 NASTY."

06:31.858 --> 06:33.226
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A BRA SIZE

06:33.226 --> 06:34.794
THAT WAS ON SALE AT

06:34.794 --> 06:35.528
VICTORIA'S SECRET UNTIL, LIKE,

06:35.528 --> 06:38.030
TWO YEARS AGO.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.766
THE THING IS, THIS ACCIDENT IS

06:39.766 --> 06:41.567
EXPOSING MORE THAN JUST

06:41.567 --> 06:42.802
CHEMICALS.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.171
IT'S EXPOSING SOME BROADER BIG

06:45.171 --> 06:46.606
ISSUES IN HOW FREIGHT TRAINS

06:46.606 --> 06:48.608

OF WHICH EVEN SEEMED TO STARTLE

06:51.410 --> 06:52.678
OHIO GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE.

06:52.678 --> 06:54.180

CONSIDERED A HIGH HAZARDOUS

06:58.518 --> 06:59.919
HAVE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL ON

06:59.919 --> 07:03.222
BOARD, AND WHILE MOST OF THEM

07:03.222 --> 07:05.191
DID NOT, THAT'S WHY IT WAS NOT

07:05.191 --> 07:08.161
CATEGORIZED AS A HIGH HAZARDOUS

07:08.161 --> 07:11.230
MATERIAL TRAIN.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.765
FRANKLY, IF THIS IS TRUE AND I'M

07:12.765 --> 07:15.635
TOLD IT'S TRUE, THIS IS ABSURD.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.670
John: OH, COME ON, MIKE!

07:17.670 --> 07:19.038
WHAT'RE YOU SO CONFUSED ABOUT?

07:19.038 --> 07:20.339
EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S NOT

07:20.339 --> 07:21.674
DANGEROUS IF ONLY PART OF

07:21.674 --> 07:23.676
SOMETHING CAN KILL YOU.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.378
THAT'S WHY RUSSIAN ROULETTE IS A

07:25.378 --> 07:26.245
GREAT ACTIVITY FOR A CHILD'S

07:26.245 --> 07:27.713
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

07:27.713 --> 07:28.714
IT'S THE NEW PIN THE TAIL ON THE

07:28.714 --> 07:29.215
DONKEY.

07:29.215 --> 07:33.119
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

07:33.119 --> 07:34.320
THEY LOVE IT, IT'S FINE!

07:34.320 --> 07:34.887
AND I WILL SAY, I DON'T KNOW

07:34.887 --> 07:36.289
EXACTLY HOW TO REGULATE OR

07:36.289 --> 07:37.757
CLASSIFY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ON

07:37.757 --> 07:39.125
TRAINS, BUT A KEY QUESTION FOR

07:39.125 --> 07:40.760
ME WOULD BE, "IF IT DERAILS,

07:40.760 --> 07:42.094
WILL AUTHORITIES HAVE TO TURN IT

07:42.094 --> 07:43.429
INTO AN APOCALYPTIC MUSHROOM

07:43.429 --> 07:44.330
CLOUD TO TRY AND MITIGATE THE

07:44.330 --> 07:46.632
DAMAGE?"

07:46.632 --> 07:47.600
BECAUSE IF YES, MAYBE SLAP THAT

07:47.600 --> 07:53.573
"HAZARDOUS" LABEL ON IT, JUST TO

07:53.573 --> 07:54.407
BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.775
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S NOW BEING

07:55.775 --> 07:56.475
DISCUSSED IS ANTIQUATED BRAKING

07:56.475 --> 07:57.476
SYSTEMS, AS ON MANY TRAINS, EACH

07:57.476 --> 07:58.811
RAILCAR RECEIVES THE STOP SIGNAL

07:58.811 --> 08:00.279
ONE AFTER THE OTHER, INSTEAD OF

08:00.279 --> 08:01.647
ALL AT ONCE, COSTING VALUABLE

08:01.647 --> 08:02.715
SECONDS.

08:02.715 --> 08:04.517
AND A LOT CAN HAPPEN IN EVEN

08:04.517 --> 08:05.451
SMALL AMOUNTS OF TIME.

08:05.451 --> 08:06.619
FOR INSTANCE, A FEW MINUTES AGO,

08:06.619 --> 08:10.690
YOU WERE EXCITED TO SEE THIS

08:10.690 --> 08:11.257
SHOW COME BACK, WEREN'T YOU?

08:11.257 --> 08:12.825
NOT SO MUCH NOW!

08:12.825 --> 08:13.693
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

08:13.693 --> 08:15.828
ACTUALLY TOOK STEPS TO ADDRESS

08:15.828 --> 08:17.163
THIS, ISSUING A RULE IN 2015

08:17.163 --> 08:18.631
REQUIRING RAILROADS TO USE

08:18.631 --> 08:20.032
ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED

08:20.032 --> 08:21.567
PNEUMATIC BRAKES ON ESPECIALLY

08:21.567 --> 08:28.207
DANGEROUS TRAINS.

08:28.207 --> 08:28.741
WHICH REMEMBER, THE TRAIN

08:28.741 --> 08:29.308
WASN'T.

08:29.308 --> 08:29.876
BUT TRAIN COMPANIES LOBBIED

08:29.876 --> 08:30.743
AGAINST IT, CONGRESS HELD IT UP,

08:30.743 --> 08:31.310
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

08:31.310 --> 08:32.545
FINALLY KILLED IT.

08:32.545 --> 08:33.980
AND IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE WEREN'T

08:33.980 --> 08:35.448
WARNING US ABOUT THE RISKS OF

08:35.448 --> 08:36.082
DOING THAT.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.683
BECAUSE HERE'S A RAIL ACCIDENT

08:37.683 --> 08:39.118
INVESTIGATOR, IN OHIO, AT THAT

08:39.118 --> 08:40.786
TIME.

08:40.786 --> 08:42.088
A CONTROLLED PNEUMATIC

08:42.088 --> 08:43.456
BRAKING SYSTEM COULD MAKE A BIG

08:43.456 --> 08:45.024
DIFFERENCE VERSUS WHAT THESE

08:45.024 --> 08:46.058
HAVE NOW.

08:46.058 --> 08:47.660
THERE HAVE BEEN FIRES,

08:47.660 --> 08:49.662
EXPLOSIONS ALL CAUSED BECAUSE

08:49.662 --> 08:51.797
THEY'RE USING THIS ANCIENT,

08:51.797 --> 08:54.400
150-YEAR-OLD BRAKING SYSTEM.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.035
IT'S BEEN AVAILABLE FOR AT LEAST

08:56.035 --> 08:57.737
20 YEARS.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.005
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT IT IN

08:59.005 --> 09:03.576
BECAUSE IT COSTS MONEY.

09:03.576 --> 09:05.478
John: EXACTLY, AND THAT'S

09:05.478 --> 09:07.380
PRETTY FRUSTRATING, BECAUSE A

09:07.380 --> 09:09.215
TRAIN'S ABILITY TO "STOP" IS

09:09.215 --> 09:09.615
KIND OF IMPORTANT.

09:09.615 --> 09:10.783
IT'S IN THE TOP 3 THINGS TRAINS

09:10.783 --> 09:12.084
NEED TO DO, ALONG WITH "GO" AND

09:12.084 --> 09:13.552
TEACH CHILDREN THEIR ONLY VALUE

09:13.552 --> 09:15.554
TO SOCIETY IS "HAVING A JOB."

09:15.554 --> 09:18.224
AND AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW YET

09:18.224 --> 09:19.659
EXACTLY WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH IN

09:19.659 --> 09:20.459
OHIO.

09:20.459 --> 09:21.861
MAYBE CLASSIFYING THAT TRAIN AS

09:21.861 --> 09:23.029
HAZARDOUS AND REQUIRING THOSE

09:23.029 --> 09:23.829
BRAKES WOULD'VE HELPED.

09:23.829 --> 09:24.263
MAYBE NOT.

09:24.263 --> 09:26.265
BUT IN GENERAL, IT SURE SEEMS

09:26.265 --> 09:27.900
LIKE WE NEED TO BE TIGHTENING

09:27.900 --> 09:29.368
THINGS UP GOING FORWARD.

09:29.368 --> 09:30.536
AND, TRAIN WORKER UNIONS HAVE

09:30.536 --> 09:31.771
BEEN WARNING US ABOUT SAFETY

09:31.771 --> 09:33.306
ISSUES FOR A LONG TIME.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.241
AND IT FEELS LIKE WE SHOULD

09:35.241 --> 09:36.375
MAYBE START LISTENING MORE TO

09:36.375 --> 09:38.444
THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY RUN

09:38.444 --> 09:39.679
THESE TRAINS, RATHER THAN JUST

09:39.679 --> 09:41.013
TO THOSE WHO PROFIT FROM THEM.

09:41.013 --> 09:42.248
BECAUSE IF YOU ASK YOURSELF

09:42.248 --> 09:43.582
WHETHER THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE

09:43.582 --> 09:45.217
WAY TO RUN A VITAL NATIONAL

09:45.217 --> 09:46.752
INDUSTRY, IF I MAY QUOTE THE

09:46.752 --> 09:47.920
PEOPLE OF EAST PALESTINE, THE

09:47.920 --> 09:52.291
ANSWER SHOULD PRETTY CLEARLY BE:

09:52.291 --> 09:53.225
EXACTLY.

09:53.225 --> 09:58.064
AND NOW THIS.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.332
Announcer: AND NOW, JIM

09:59.332 --> 10:03.135
CRAMER WILL NOT SHUT UP ABOUT

10:03.135 --> 10:03.402
HIS SUITS.

SUIT.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.144
YOU LOOK AMAZING BY THE WAY.

10:12.144 --> 10:13.279

10:13.279 --> 10:18.417

10:19.752 --> 10:20.319

10:20.319 --> 10:21.654
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S A SUIT WORTH

10:21.654 --> 10:23.789
A LOT MORE THAN YOU.

REPORTER GETTING INADVERTENTLY

HALF TONS OF HEROIN, OPIUM,

11:24.984 --> 11:28.454

11:44.770 --> 11:46.138
THAT DESERVES THE PULITZER PRIZE

11:46.138 --> 11:49.875
FOR "REPORTER ON MOST DRUGS."

11:49.875 --> 11:50.676
I'M NOT SURE WHAT MY FAVORITE

11:50.676 --> 11:51.410
PART IS.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.045
HIS LITTLE GIGGLE, THE IDEA THAT

11:53.045 --> 11:54.180
SOMEONE THOUGHT "LET'S PUT A GUY

11:54.180 --> 11:55.281
DOWNWIND FROM AN EIGHT AND A

11:55.281 --> 11:56.715
HALF TON PILE OF BURNING

11:56.715 --> 11:58.284
NARCOTICS," OR THE FACT THAT ITS

11:58.284 --> 11:59.718
MAIN EFFECT ON HIM WAS TO "TURN

11:59.718 --> 12:02.254
HIM INTO A TOTAL SWEETIE PIE."

12:02.254 --> 12:03.589
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

12:03.589 --> 12:04.990
TALK ABOUT PSYCHEDELICS, a

12:04.990 --> 12:06.459
CATEGORY THAT INCLUDES DRUGS

12:06.459 --> 12:07.426
LIKE PSILOCYBIN, LSD, AND MDMA.

12:07.426 --> 12:10.429
AND LET ME FIRST SAY, I KNOW.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.864
ANYONE WITH MY FACE, VOICE, AND

12:11.864 --> 12:12.932
GENERALLY OFF-PUTTING AURA WHO

12:12.932 --> 12:14.700
TALKS ABOUT DRUGS IS USUALLY

12:14.700 --> 12:15.468
WARNING YOU ABOUT "THE DEVIL'S

12:15.468 --> 12:17.336
LETTUCE."

12:17.336 --> 12:18.771
BUT I'M NO FUCKING NARC.

12:18.771 --> 12:19.905
IN COLLEGE I PRACTICALLY MAJORED

12:19.905 --> 12:21.407
IN HERBOLOGY WITH A MINOR IN

12:21.407 --> 12:22.741
GANJA-NEERING.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.110
THEY CALLED ME SONIC THE

12:24.110 --> 12:26.145
HEDGEHOG BECAUSE I ROLLED

12:26.145 --> 12:27.613
TIGHTLY.

12:27.613 --> 12:28.714
ALSO, I'VE DONE BLOW ON TOUR

12:28.714 --> 12:30.483
WITH OZZY OSBOURNE, WHO'S MY DAD

12:30.483 --> 12:31.250
BY THE WAY.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.151
SO I'M IN THE SCENE, OKAY?

12:32.151 --> 12:33.886
I GET IT.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.121
THE TRUTH IS, LOTS OF PEOPLE USE

12:35.121 --> 12:36.055
PSYCHEDELICS.

12:36.055 --> 12:37.156
SOME FOR SPIRITUALITY, SOME FOR

12:37.156 --> 12:38.724
HEALING, AND SOME, LIKE ASAP

12:38.724 --> 12:40.626
ROCKY, JUST FOR FUN.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.228
THE FIRST TIME HE DID LSD, IT

12:42.228 --> 12:43.996
STARTED TO KICK IN JUST AS HE

12:43.996 --> 12:44.663
WAS HAVING SEX, WITH SURPRISING

12:44.663 --> 12:47.399
CONSEQUENCES.

12:47.399 --> 12:49.935
NO LIE, A RAINBOW SHOT OUT OF

12:49.935 --> 12:51.637
MY DICK.

12:51.637 --> 12:53.939
AND IT HAD A SOUND WITH IT, LIKE

12:53.939 --> 12:55.641
A PIANO OR SOME SHIT.

12:55.641 --> 12:57.209
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THERE WAS A

12:57.209 --> 13:00.679
RAINBOW COMING OUT OF MY PENIS.

13:00.679 --> 13:03.015
I DON'T EVEN LIKE RAINBOW.

13:03.015 --> 13:04.550
John: EXCELLENT.

13:04.550 --> 13:05.951
EVERY SENTENCE IS BETTER THAN

13:05.951 --> 13:06.952
THE LAST.

13:06.952 --> 13:07.586
"A RAINBOW SHOT OUT OF MY DICK"

13:07.586 --> 13:08.988
FANTASTIC.

13:08.988 --> 13:09.855
"IT HAD A SOUND WITH IT, LIKE A

13:09.855 --> 13:10.589
PIANO OR SOME SHIT"

13:10.589 --> 13:11.991
LOVE IT.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.459
"I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THERE WAS A

13:13.459 --> 13:15.828
RAINBOW COMING OUT OF MY PENIS"

13:15.828 --> 13:17.830
NOW, HE'S INTRODUCED SUSPENSE!

13:17.830 --> 13:19.098
"I DON'T EVEN LIKE RAINBOWS."

13:19.098 --> 13:21.000
WHAT A WAY TO STICK THE LANDING.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.135
ALSO, I'M PRETTY SURE ASAP ROCKY

13:23.135 --> 13:24.370
JUST GAVE SKITTLES THEIR NEXT

13:24.370 --> 13:25.337
COMMERCIAL.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.138
"SKITTLES: TASTE THE DICK

13:26.138 --> 13:30.809
RAINBOW."

13:30.809 --> 13:31.477
[LAUGHTER]

13:31.477 --> 13:32.044
BUT TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO

13:32.044 --> 13:32.645
FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR USE OF

13:32.645 --> 13:34.380
PSYCHEDELICS IN THERAPY.

13:34.380 --> 13:35.548
IT'S A FIELD YOU MAY HAVE HEARD

13:35.548 --> 13:36.615
ABOUT RECENTLY, IN STORIES

13:36.615 --> 13:38.384
FEATURING TESTIMONIES FROM SOME

13:38.384 --> 13:40.286
VERY SATISFIED PATIENTS.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.154
I HAD ALL THIS ACCESS TO MY

13:42.154 --> 13:43.756
MIND AND I COULD CONTROL WHERE I

13:43.756 --> 13:45.391
WAS THINKING AND GOING.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.892
IT CONNECTED ME BACK TO MY

13:46.892 --> 13:48.627
BODY, LIKE I COULD FEEL MY BODY

13:48.627 --> 13:49.628
AGAIN.

13:49.628 --> 13:50.930
IT MADE ME FEEL MORE

13:50.930 --> 13:52.831
COMFORTABLE WITH-- WITH LIVING,

13:52.831 --> 13:56.902
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

13:56.902 --> 13:59.572
AFRAID OF DYING.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.673
IT'S LIKE DOING THERAPY WHILE

14:00.673 --> 14:02.975
BEING HUGGED BY EVERYONE WHO

14:02.975 --> 14:03.676
LOVES YOU IN A BATHTUB FULL OF

14:03.676 --> 14:05.411
PUPPIES LICKING YOUR FACE.

14:05.411 --> 14:06.946
John: WOW.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.013
THAT'S A PRETTY POWERFUL

14:08.013 --> 14:09.315
ENDORSEMENT.

14:09.315 --> 14:10.816
HE MAKES IT SOUND PRETTY NICE.

14:10.816 --> 14:12.184
IT'D SOUND NICER IF A RAINBOW

14:12.184 --> 14:13.285
ALSO SHOT OUT OF YOUR DICK, BUT

14:13.285 --> 14:15.421
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE ASAP ROCKY

14:15.421 --> 14:16.722
HAS NOW RAISED THE BAR ON WHAT

14:16.722 --> 14:17.289
CONSTITUTES A PLEASANT HUMAN

14:17.289 --> 14:18.991
EXPERIENCE.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.292
THAT LAST GUY IS A VETERAN WHO

14:20.292 --> 14:22.194
CLAIMS THAT PSYCHEDELIC

14:22.194 --> 14:24.096
TREATMENT NOT ONLY HELPED HIM

14:24.096 --> 14:25.097
WITH PTSD BUT SAVED HIS LIFE--

14:25.097 --> 14:27.032
AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY VET WHO'S

14:27.032 --> 14:28.601
BENEFITED.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.535
I HAD THREE EXPERIENCES AT

14:29.535 --> 14:33.038
FULL DOSAGE, BUT THE EFFECTS

14:33.038 --> 14:35.007
AFTER THE FIRST TREATMENT WERE

14:35.007 --> 14:36.809
PROFOUND.

14:36.809 --> 14:37.409
I WOULD HAVE SAID A 60%

14:37.409 --> 14:40.012
REDUCTION IN MY SYMPTOMS

14:40.012 --> 14:42.214
IMMEDIATELY.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.349
I FELT A MIGHTY CHANGE HAD

14:43.349 --> 14:45.017
OCCURRED.

14:45.017 --> 14:46.752
John: 60% IMMEDIATELY.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.087
IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU SEE THOSE

14:48.087 --> 14:49.288
KINDS OF RESULTS AFTER YOUR

14:49.288 --> 14:50.456
FIRST THERAPY SESSION.

14:50.456 --> 14:51.757
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT SO MUCH OF

14:51.757 --> 14:54.026
IT HAPPENS ON ZOOM.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.294
USUALLY DAY ONE IS SPENT FOR

14:55.294 --> 14:56.795
INTRODUCTIONS AND TRYING TO

14:56.795 --> 14:57.963
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUCK THAT

14:57.963 --> 14:58.831
THING BEHIND YOUR THERAPIST'S

14:58.831 --> 14:59.398
HEAD IS.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.232
THAT CAN'T BE WHAT I THINK IT

15:00.232 --> 15:00.933
IS, RIGHT?

15:00.933 --> 15:04.036
IT JUST CAN'T BE.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.672
AND IT'S NOT JUST ANECDOTAL, A

15:06.672 --> 15:08.040
RECENT CLINICAL TRIAL OF MDMA

15:08.040 --> 15:09.375
ASSISTED THERAPY FOUND THAT, FOR

15:09.375 --> 15:10.776
THOSE SUFFERING FROM PTSD.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.711
JUST TWO MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT,

15:12.711 --> 15:15.681
67% NO LONGER QUALIFIED FOR A

15:15.681 --> 15:17.583
PTSD DIAGNOSIS.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.118
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN GETTING INTO

15:19.118 --> 15:20.619
THE PROMISE PSYCHEDELICS HAVE

15:20.619 --> 15:21.920
SHOWN IN TREATING CONDITIONS

15:21.920 --> 15:22.855
LIKE ADDICTION AND DEPRESSION.

15:22.855 --> 15:23.956
THE FACT IS, ALL THIS IS HUGELY

15:23.956 --> 15:26.358
ENCOURAGING.

15:26.358 --> 15:27.559
BUT IT'S WORTH KNOWING, WE'VE

15:27.559 --> 15:29.228
ACTUALLY BEEN HERE BEFORE WITH

15:29.228 --> 15:32.064
PSYCHEDELICS, AND FUCKED IT ALL

15:32.064 --> 15:32.731
UP.

15:32.731 --> 15:33.432
AND IF WE'RE NOT VERY CAREFUL IN

15:33.432 --> 15:34.767
THE YEARS AHEAD, WE COULD GO

15:34.767 --> 15:35.367
BACKWARDS AGAIN.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.002
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

15:37.002 --> 15:38.437
PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.471
ITS HISTORY, ITS POTENTIAL, AND

15:39.471 --> 15:40.172
WHAT THE PITFALLS AHEAD MIGHT

15:40.172 --> 15:42.007
BE.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.475
AND LET'S BEGIN BY ACKNOWLEDGING

15:43.475 --> 15:45.244
A LOT OF THESE MEDICINES,

15:45.244 --> 15:46.278
ESPECIALLY PSILOCYBIN, ARE

15:46.278 --> 15:46.812
NOTHING NEW TO INDIGENOUS

15:46.812 --> 15:48.280
COMMUNITIES, WHO'VE BEEN

15:48.280 --> 15:49.548
CONDUCTING RITUALS INVOLVING

15:49.548 --> 15:51.250
MUSHROOMS, PEYOTE, AYAHUASCA,

15:51.250 --> 15:52.751
AND OTHER CEREMONIAL MEDICINES,

15:52.751 --> 15:53.319
FOR FAR LONGER THAN WESTERN

15:53.319 --> 15:54.920
CIVILIZATION HAS.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.622
BUT INTEREST IN PSYCHEDELICS

15:56.622 --> 15:58.457
OUTSIDE OF INDIGENOUS

15:58.457 --> 15:59.391
COMMUNITIES REALLY PICKED UP

15:59.391 --> 16:00.626
AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST

16:00.626 --> 16:01.360
CENTURY.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.028
LSD WAS FIRST SYNTHESIZED IN A

16:03.028 --> 16:04.596
SWISS LAB IN 1938.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.732
AND A BANKER AT JP MORGAN NAMED

16:06.732 --> 16:08.967
R.

16:08.967 --> 16:09.601
GORDON WASSON POPULARIZED MAGIC

16:09.601 --> 16:10.202
MUSHROOMS, AFTER HEARING ABOUT

16:10.202 --> 16:11.170
AN INDIGENOUS MEXICAN WOMAN

16:11.170 --> 16:16.308
NAMED MARIA SABINA, WHO USED

16:16.308 --> 16:16.942
THEM IN HEALING CEREMONIES, AND

16:16.942 --> 16:18.777
TRACKED HER DOWN IN 1955.

16:18.777 --> 16:20.145
AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS, HE

16:20.145 --> 16:21.914
FINALLY CONVINCES MARIA SABINA

16:21.914 --> 16:24.383
TO LET HIM TASTE THE "MAGIC

16:24.383 --> 16:24.983
MUSHROOMS," AS THEY CAME TO BE

16:24.983 --> 16:26.085
CALLED.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.120
HE COMES BACK AND WRITES AN

16:28.120 --> 16:30.155
ACCOUNT OF HIS ADVENTURE THAT IS

16:30.155 --> 16:30.756
PUBLISHED IN LIFE MAGAZINE OF

16:30.756 --> 16:33.192
ALL PLACES.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.293
NOW THIS IS ASTONISHING.

16:34.293 --> 16:36.061
THIS IS 1957 WHEN IT COMES OUT,

16:36.061 --> 16:37.629
THOUSANDS OF WORDS IN THE

16:37.629 --> 16:39.798
BIGGEST MAGAZINE IN AMERICA.

16:39.798 --> 16:41.266
THIS ARTICLE, WHEN IT'S

16:41.266 --> 16:45.637
PUBLISHED, IS A SENSATION.

16:45.637 --> 16:46.238
John: IT'S TRUE, WASSON WAS

16:46.238 --> 16:47.239
BASICALLY THE VERY FIRST WHITE

16:47.239 --> 16:47.906
GUY WHO DID SHROOMS THEN MADE IT

16:47.906 --> 16:49.675
HIS WHOLE PERSONALITY.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.410
THAT ARTICLE STARTED A STAMPEDE

16:51.410 --> 16:53.312
OF HIPPIES AND CELEBRITIES INTO

16:53.312 --> 16:55.047
MARIA SABINA'S VILLAGE, THAT

16:55.047 --> 17:00.252
TURNED HER NEIGHBORS AGAINST HER

17:00.252 --> 17:02.755
TO SUCH A POINT THEY

17:02.755 --> 17:10.829
BURN HER HOUSE TO THE GROUND.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.198
SO ADD MUSHROOMS ALONG TO THE

17:13.198 --> 17:14.767
LIST THAT RUINED

17:14.767 --> 17:15.401
FINANCE BROS, ALONG WITH VESTS,

17:15.401 --> 17:16.001
DATING APPS, AND THE MIDDLE

17:16.001 --> 17:17.236
CLASS.

17:17.236 --> 17:18.137
BUT IT WASN'T JUST BANKERS AND

17:18.137 --> 17:18.737
HIPPIES DRAWN TO THE POWER OF

17:18.737 --> 17:19.938
THESE SUBSTANCES.

17:19.938 --> 17:20.773
THE U.S. MILITARY ACTUALLY

17:20.773 --> 17:21.740
CONDUCTED EXPERIMENTS TO SEE IF

17:21.740 --> 17:22.841
THEY COULD BE DROPPED ON ENEMY

17:22.841 --> 17:23.409
TROOPS TO INCAPACITATE THEM.

17:23.409 --> 17:24.877
AND LUCKY FOR US, THEY FILMED

17:24.877 --> 17:25.511
THOSE EXPERIMENTS FOR POSTERITY.

17:25.511 --> 17:26.278
HERE IS A GROUP OF NORMAL

17:26.278 --> 17:27.212
SOLDIERS RESPONDING CORRECTLY TO

17:27.212 --> 17:27.746
A SERIES OF ROUTINE DRILL

17:27.746 --> 17:28.947
COMMANDS.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.617
AFTER RECEIVING A SMALL DOSE OF

17:31.617 --> 17:32.151
LSD, THEY'RE CONFUSED AND

17:32.151 --> 17:34.620
UNDISCIPLINED.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.021
John: YEAH, YOU REALLY GOT

17:36.021 --> 17:37.523
THEM THERE.

17:37.523 --> 17:38.524
THOSE SOLDIERS WENT FROM

17:38.524 --> 17:40.492
"TIGHTLY CHOREOGRAPHED PARADE"

17:40.492 --> 17:42.127
TO "TOURISTS TRYING TO DECIDE

17:42.127 --> 17:42.761
WHERE TO HAVE LUNCH," AND ALL IT

17:42.761 --> 17:43.929
TOOK WAS A TINY BIT OF CHEMICAL

17:43.929 --> 17:45.831
WARFARE.

17:45.831 --> 17:46.532
IT'S BRILLIANT!

17:46.532 --> 17:47.666
BUT EVEN AS THE ARMY WAS DICKING

17:47.666 --> 17:49.568
AROUND TRYING TO INVENT A

17:49.568 --> 17:50.869
LITERAL LOVE-BOMB, SOME

17:50.869 --> 17:51.503
RESEARCHERS WERE USING LSD AS A

17:51.503 --> 17:53.472
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT.

17:53.472 --> 17:55.207
IN 1966, CBS NEWS ACTUALLY

17:55.207 --> 17:57.676
FOLLOWED A MAN WHO RECEIVED LSD

17:57.676 --> 17:59.445
AS PART OF HIS TREATMENT FOR

17:59.445 --> 18:01.346
ALCOHOLISM, AND REPORTED ON ITS

18:01.346 --> 18:03.248
STARTLING RESULTS.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.550
SIX MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT

18:04.550 --> 18:07.453
WITH LSD, SIX MONTHS AFTER HIS

18:07.453 --> 18:08.220
RELEASE FROM THE ALCOHOLICS'

18:08.220 --> 18:09.988
WARD AT SPRING GROVE HOSPITAL,

18:09.988 --> 18:11.523
ARTHUR KING HAS STARTED OVER.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.525
AT THE AGE OF 33, HE HAS GONE

18:13.525 --> 18:14.893
BACK TO SCHOOL, SOMETHING HE

18:14.893 --> 18:16.428
TALKED ABOUT DOING FOR YEARS.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.231
IN EVENING CLASSES, HE'S

18:19.231 --> 18:21.066
STUDYING ACCOUNTING.

18:21.066 --> 18:21.700
HAVE YOU HAD ANYTHING TO DRINK,

18:21.700 --> 18:22.034
FOR EXAMPLE?

18:22.034 --> 18:23.368
NO, I HAVEN'T.

18:23.368 --> 18:24.736
NOTHING AT ALL.

18:24.736 --> 18:25.838
AND I HAVEN'T HAD ANY DESIRE TO

18:25.838 --> 18:27.739
DRINK ANYTHING.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.241
John: THAT'S INCREDIBLE, BUT

18:29.241 --> 18:31.910
ALSO, THAT GUY'S 33?

18:31.910 --> 18:36.281
I KNOW I'M HARDLY ONE TO TALK,

18:36.281 --> 18:37.282
AS A LEGAL 45 BUT A "SPIRITUAL

18:37.282 --> 18:38.150
OCTEGENARIAN."

18:38.150 --> 18:39.818
BUT HOLY SHIT, PEOPLE SURE AGED

18:39.818 --> 18:41.353
A LOT WORSE BACK WHEN WE PAINTED

18:41.353 --> 18:42.588
EVERYTHING WITH LEAD AND LET

18:42.588 --> 18:43.355
PEOPLE SMOKE IN THE DELIVERY

18:43.355 --> 18:44.590
ROOM.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.325
UNFORTUNATELY, BY THE LATE

18:46.325 --> 18:47.693
1960S, PSYCHEDELICS BECAME

18:47.693 --> 18:48.994
INCREASINGLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

18:48.994 --> 18:49.528
COUNTERCULTURE.

18:49.528 --> 18:50.863
AND AS THE GOVERNMENT CRACKED

18:50.863 --> 18:52.798
DOWN ON THAT MOVEMENT, THEY

18:52.798 --> 18:54.366
BEGAN AN ERA OF ANTI-PSYCHEDELIC

18:54.366 --> 18:57.769
HYSTERIA.

18:57.769 --> 18:58.237
AND IT WAS INTENSE.

18:58.237 --> 18:59.471
JUNK STUDIES MADE DUBIOUS BUT

18:59.471 --> 19:00.272
TERRIFYING CLAIMS, LIKE THAT LSD

19:00.272 --> 19:02.140
COULD WARP YOUR CHROMOSOMES, AND

19:02.140 --> 19:04.176
EDUCATIONAL FILMS EMPLOYED A

19:04.176 --> 19:05.944
WIDE RANGE OF TONES, AND SCARE

19:05.944 --> 19:07.479
TACTICS, LIKE THESE.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.548
THIS IS A FETUS FROM A MOTHER

19:09.548 --> 19:11.116
NOT RECEIVING LSD, A NORMAL

19:11.116 --> 19:12.551
FETUS.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.553
THIS IS A FETUS FROM THE MOTHER

19:14.553 --> 19:15.487
RECEIVING LSD.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.955
I KNOW DOCTORS, AND I KNOW

19:16.955 --> 19:18.757
LAWYERS, AND I KNOW THE MOST

19:18.757 --> 19:22.027
STABLE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT

19:22.027 --> 19:24.129
HAVE TAKEN TRIPS ON LSD AND ARE

19:24.129 --> 19:25.631
STILL WAITING TO RETURN.

19:25.631 --> 19:34.106
UNFORTUNATELY, THESE DREAMY,

19:34.106 --> 19:36.308
PSYCHEDELIC TRIPS ARE VERY

19:36.308 --> 19:36.675
OFTEN, ONE-WAY.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.109
John: WOW, OKAY.

19:37.109 --> 19:37.743
THAT'S QUITE THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN,

19:37.743 --> 19:38.477
FROM THE HAMSTER FETUS THAT

19:38.477 --> 19:39.912
LOOKS LIKE DINO NUGGETS, TO THE

19:39.912 --> 19:40.679
WOMAN SCREAMING AT YOU ABOUT ALL

19:40.679 --> 19:41.647
THE DOCTORS AND LAWYERS SHE

19:41.647 --> 19:42.714
KNOWS, TO THE HEARSE THAT

19:42.714 --> 19:43.715
APPARENTLY MAKES HOUSE CALLS.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.250
AND WHILE ALL OF THAT WAS

19:45.250 --> 19:46.118
NONSENSE, I DO MISS THE DAYS

19:46.118 --> 19:48.754
WHEN WE USED TO GET DRESSED UP

19:48.754 --> 19:49.254
TO WATCH OUR DRUGGED-OUT

19:49.254 --> 19:50.355
RELATIVES GET CARTED OFF TO THE

19:50.355 --> 19:50.822
MORGUE.

19:50.822 --> 19:52.090
"HONEY, THEY'LL BE HAULING

19:52.090 --> 19:53.625
JIMMY'S BODY TO ITS FINAL STOP

19:53.625 --> 19:55.093
BEFORE HIPPIE HELL, QUICK,

19:55.093 --> 19:55.627
WHERE'S MY TIE CLIP?

19:55.627 --> 19:56.528
HELEN!

19:56.528 --> 19:57.896
TIE CLIP!

19:57.896 --> 19:58.864
THE NEIGHBORS MAY SEE, THEY'RE

19:58.864 --> 20:01.199
GONNA THINK WE'RE POOR, GET IT

20:01.199 --> 20:02.768
TOGETHER AND FIND MY TIE CLIP!

20:02.768 --> 20:05.804
THE BOY IS DEAD!"

20:05.804 --> 20:06.805
TALL TALES ABOUT LSD RAN

20:06.805 --> 20:07.906
RAMPANT.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.274
AT ONE POINT, A PENNSYLVANIA

20:09.274 --> 20:16.415
STATE COMMISSIONER BUT THE

20:16.415 --> 20:19.451
CLAIMED STUDENTS WENT COMPLETELY

20:19.451 --> 20:19.651
BLIND.

20:19.651 --> 20:21.320
BUT THE TRUTH AS HE MADE IT UP.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.621
HE LAID AND ADMITTED THE HOAX HE

20:22.621 --> 20:26.658
ATTENDED THE LECTURE AND BECAME

20:26.658 --> 20:28.427
CONCERNED HE WANTED TO SCARE

20:28.427 --> 20:30.495
PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE DRUG BUT

20:30.495 --> 20:31.730
THE HYSTERIA HIT ITS ABSOLUTE

20:31.730 --> 20:32.497
PEAK WHEN NIXON

20:32.497 --> 20:33.131
PASSED THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES

20:33.131 --> 20:33.665
ACT, WHICH PLACED LSD AND

20:33.665 --> 20:34.299
PSILOCYBIN IN THE MOST

20:34.299 --> 20:36.335
RESTRICTIVE LEGAL CATEGORY

20:36.335 --> 20:36.935
POSSIBLE, ALONGSIDE DRUGS LIKE

20:36.935 --> 20:43.141
HEROIN, ESSENTIALLY STOPPING

20:43.141 --> 20:43.709
MEDICAL RESEARCH DEAD IN ITS

20:43.709 --> 20:44.309
TRACKS.

20:44.309 --> 20:45.077
ONE RESEARCHER DESCRIBED THE

20:45.077 --> 20:45.677
WORK AS BEING PUT IN THE "DEEP

20:45.677 --> 20:47.012
FREEZE."

20:47.012 --> 20:47.579
AND WHEN SCIENTISTS STARTED

20:47.579 --> 20:48.981
WORKING WITH MDMA, IT, TOO, GOT

20:48.981 --> 20:50.115
SWEPT UP INTO THE PANIC, WITH

20:50.115 --> 20:51.550
THE JOURNAL SCIENCE ALLEGING

20:51.550 --> 20:53.518
THAT JUST ONE USE CAN CAUSE

20:53.518 --> 20:54.152
PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE IN

20:54.152 --> 21:00.192
MONKEYS, A STUDY THAT GOT A LOT

21:00.192 --> 21:00.726
OF ATTENTION BEFORE BEING

21:00.726 --> 21:02.094
RETRACTED AFTER IT WAS FOUND

21:02.094 --> 21:03.128
THAT THE MONKEYS HADN'T ACTUALLY

21:03.128 --> 21:04.796
TAKEN MDMA AT ALL,

21:04.796 --> 21:06.064
BUT INSTEAD, HAD BEEN GIVEN

21:06.064 --> 21:07.032
METH.

21:07.032 --> 21:07.833
AND THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT

21:07.833 --> 21:10.369
DRUG!

21:10.369 --> 21:11.269
ANY STUDY'S RESULT IS GOING TO

21:11.269 --> 21:12.604
CHANGE IF THE INDEPENDENT

21:12.604 --> 21:13.705
VARIABLE IS SUDDENLY, AND

21:13.705 --> 21:16.708
UNEXPECTEDLY, METH.

21:16.708 --> 21:17.809
"WE'VE STUDIED THE VACCINE FOR

21:17.809 --> 21:19.444
COVID AND THE PARTICIPANTS ARE

21:19.444 --> 21:22.280
GOING APESHIT FOR IT!"

21:22.280 --> 21:23.348
BUT IN RECENT YEARS, PERCEPTIONS

21:23.348 --> 21:24.549
HAVE FINALLY BEGUN TO SHIFT,

21:24.549 --> 21:26.084
WITH THE FDA GRANTING

21:26.084 --> 21:28.286
BREAKTHROUGH STATUS TO SUPPORT

21:28.286 --> 21:29.521
THE STUDY OF MDMA FOR TREATING

21:29.521 --> 21:30.856
PTSD, AND DOING THE SAME FOR

21:30.856 --> 21:32.524
PSILOCYBIN TO TREAT DEPRESSION.

21:32.524 --> 21:34.092
AND AT THIS POINT, LET'S TALK

21:34.092 --> 21:35.427
ABOUT EXACTLY WHY PSYCHEDELICS

21:35.427 --> 21:37.629
CAN BE SO EFFECTIVE.

21:37.629 --> 21:38.597
DIFFERENT ONES CAN WORK IN

21:38.597 --> 21:39.631
DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT FOR

21:39.631 --> 21:41.066
INSTANCE, RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

21:41.066 --> 21:42.267
MDMA DAMPENS THE RESPONSE IN THE

21:42.267 --> 21:43.702
AMYGDALA, WHICH IS THE

21:43.702 --> 21:45.337
THREAT-DETECTING CENTER OF THE

21:45.337 --> 21:46.938
BRAIN, MEANING YOU'RE ABLE TO

21:46.938 --> 21:48.273
CONFRONT AND PROCESS TRAUMA THAT

21:48.273 --> 21:50.108
YOU CAN'T OTHERWISE FACE.

21:50.108 --> 21:51.743
HERE'S ONE RESEARCHER EXPLAINING

21:51.743 --> 21:53.478
HOW IT WORKS WITH A STORY ABOUT

21:53.478 --> 21:55.247
TAKING MDMA RECREATIONALLY IN

21:55.247 --> 21:56.715
HIS YOUNGER DAYS.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.417
I CAN REMEMBER ONE TIME AFTER

21:58.417 --> 22:00.819
A RAVE, ALL OF US LYING AROUND

22:00.819 --> 22:03.155
ALL LOVED UP AND SOMEBODY SAID,

22:03.155 --> 22:04.456
"OH, WOW, THIS IS AMAZING.

22:04.456 --> 22:06.124
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

22:06.124 --> 22:06.725
EVERYTHING'S SO PERFECT."

22:06.725 --> 22:08.894
AND SOMEONE SAID, "LET'S THINK

22:08.894 --> 22:09.528
OF THE WORST POSSIBLE THING WE

22:09.528 --> 22:11.163
CAN IMAGINE."

22:11.163 --> 22:11.997
AND SOMEONE SAID, "LET'S--

22:11.997 --> 22:14.132
LET'S IMAGINE OUR MUMS DYING."

22:14.132 --> 22:15.333
AND THEN SOMEONE SAID, "IT'S NOT

22:15.333 --> 22:18.203
THAT BAD."

22:18.203 --> 22:19.705
AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT THEN, BUT

22:19.705 --> 22:24.076
THAT REALLY WAS WHAT MDMA DOES.

22:24.076 --> 22:27.879
IT ALLOWS YOU TO THINK ABOUT AND

22:27.879 --> 22:29.281
GO TO THOSE DARK, DIFFICULT,

22:29.281 --> 22:32.350
FORBIDDEN AVOIDANT MEMORIES THAT

22:32.350 --> 22:32.951
YOU NORMALLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

22:32.951 --> 22:34.219
TOUCH.

22:34.219 --> 22:36.588
John: THAT'S FASCINATING, AND

22:36.588 --> 22:37.823
I'M GLAD THAT WORKED OUT FOR

22:37.823 --> 22:38.457
HIM, BUT "LET'S IMAGINE OUR MUMS

22:38.457 --> 22:42.294
DYING" DOESN'T SOUND AN AMAZING

22:42.294 --> 22:43.328
TIME.

22:43.328 --> 22:44.296
IT SOUNDS LIKE A RAVE DJ'D BY

22:44.296 --> 22:45.564
WERNER HERZOG.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.199
"LIFE IS FLEETING.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.967
LET'S IMAGINE OUR MUMS DYING AS

22:48.967 --> 22:50.769
A SOLEMN REMINDER THAT ALL WE

22:50.769 --> 22:52.237
HAVE IS TONIGHT.

22:52.237 --> 22:54.172
NOW, WAVE YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR

22:54.172 --> 22:55.841
AS IF OUR SLOW PASSAGE TOWARDS

22:55.841 --> 22:57.509
OBLIVION MAKES YOU JUST NOT

22:57.509 --> 23:02.781
CARE."

23:02.781 --> 23:04.616
[LAUGHTER]

23:04.616 --> 23:05.317
[APPLAUSE]

23:05.317 --> 23:05.917
NOW, TO BE CLEAR, PSYCHEDELIC

23:05.917 --> 23:06.518
THERAPY INVOLVES MUCH MORE THAN

23:06.518 --> 23:08.553
JUST TAKING A PILL.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.323
THESE DRUGS ALONE DON'T

23:11.323 --> 23:11.990
AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCE RESULTS.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.592
USUALLY, TREATMENT ENTAILS

23:13.592 --> 23:15.060
MULTIPLE SESSIONS LASTING MOST

23:15.060 --> 23:16.495
OF THE DAY, IN WHICH YOU TAKE

23:16.495 --> 23:17.796
MDMA OR PSILOCYBIN UNDER THE

23:17.796 --> 23:19.131
SUPERVISION OF MEDICAL

23:19.131 --> 23:19.831
PROFESSIONALS, AND THEN FOLLOW

23:19.831 --> 23:20.766
UP WITH PROCESSING AND

23:20.766 --> 23:21.600
AFTERCARE.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.801
THEY'RE NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR

23:22.801 --> 23:23.935
CONVENTIONAL TALK THERAPY, THEY

23:23.935 --> 23:25.904
JUST SEEM TO MAKE YOU MUCH MORE

23:25.904 --> 23:27.506
RECEPTIVE TO IT.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.107
JUST WATCH THIS FORMER

23:29.107 --> 23:30.442
FIREFIGHTER NARRATE VIDEO OF

23:30.442 --> 23:31.943
HIMSELF, UNDERGOING

23:31.943 --> 23:33.478
MDMA-ASSISTED THERAPY.

23:33.478 --> 23:34.212
THIS IS YOUR FIRST MEDICATED

23:34.212 --> 23:35.180
TREATMENT SESSION.

23:35.180 --> 23:36.414
CORRECT.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.482
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF SOME

23:37.482 --> 23:38.116
INTERESTING REVELATIONS ON THIS

23:38.116 --> 23:39.618
VIDEO.

23:39.618 --> 23:40.886
ARE YOU FEELING COMPLETELY

23:40.886 --> 23:41.520
CONSCIOUS AND YOU'RE IN CONTROL

23:41.520 --> 23:42.587
AND--

23:42.587 --> 23:44.523
YEAH, I FELT LIKE I WAS ABLE

23:44.523 --> 23:46.625
TO RELAX EVEN WHEN I WAS TALKING

23:46.625 --> 23:47.793
THROUGH PROBABLY MY MOST

23:47.793 --> 23:49.795
TRAUMATIC MEMORIES.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.029
I DON'T THINK I'D SEEN A DEAD

23:51.029 --> 23:55.066
PERSON UNTIL THEN.

23:55.066 --> 23:55.767
FIRST ONE WAS GRUESOME, TOO.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.035
IT WAS LIKE BEING ABLE TO TAKE A

23:57.035 --> 23:59.304
BIG BREATH, YOU KNOW, AFTER

23:59.304 --> 23:59.871
BEING STUCK UNDERWATER FOR A

23:59.871 --> 24:00.839
LONG TIME.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.374
John: YEAH, AND YOU CAN SEE

24:02.374 --> 24:04.075
THE UTILITY OF HAVING TWO PEOPLE

24:04.075 --> 24:05.477
EITHER SIDE OF THAT MAN, TALKING

24:05.477 --> 24:06.511
HIM THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE.

24:06.511 --> 24:08.079
AND IF IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M

24:08.079 --> 24:09.447
TREATING "HAVING TWO PEOPLE TO

24:09.447 --> 24:10.015
TALK TO ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS"

24:10.015 --> 24:11.650
LIKE A RADICAL IDEA, YOU HAVE TO

24:11.650 --> 24:15.253
REMEMBER I WAS BORN TRAGICALLY,

24:15.253 --> 24:16.288
MEDICALLY BRITISH.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.523
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS, IT'S NOT

24:18.523 --> 24:20.792
JUST THAT YOUR FEAR IS MUTED,

24:20.792 --> 24:21.993
YOUR BRAIN'S ABILITY TO MAKE

24:21.993 --> 24:23.061
OTHER CONNECTIONS AND FORGE NEW

24:23.061 --> 24:23.562
NEURAL PATHWAYS IS ALSO

24:23.562 --> 24:24.930
HEIGHTENED.

24:24.930 --> 24:26.131
MEANING THESE SESSIONS CAN

24:26.131 --> 24:27.098
FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE WAY YOU

24:27.098 --> 24:28.400
PROCESS THINGS.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.835
THAT'S THOUGHT TO BE ONE REASON

24:29.835 --> 24:30.769
WHY PSYCHEDELICS ARE SO

24:30.769 --> 24:31.703
PROMISING FOR TREATING

24:31.703 --> 24:32.304
CONDITIONS LIKE ADDICTION AND

24:32.304 --> 24:34.339
DEPRESSION.

24:34.339 --> 24:36.274
AND WHY THEY'RE PROVING

24:36.274 --> 24:36.875
ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR DEALING

24:36.875 --> 24:38.243
WITH TRAUMA.

24:38.243 --> 24:39.678
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS FORM OF

24:39.678 --> 24:41.112
THERAPY PARTICULARLY APPEALING

24:41.112 --> 24:42.881
TO VETERANS, AS PTSD IS AN

24:42.881 --> 24:43.949
URGENT ISSUE FOR THEM.

24:43.949 --> 24:46.051
IN 2019, OVER 6,000 VETERANS

24:46.051 --> 24:47.953
DIED BY SUICIDE, A RATE

24:47.953 --> 24:49.788
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THE

24:49.788 --> 24:51.256
GENERAL POPULATION.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.524
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE VA'S

24:52.524 --> 24:54.392
CURRENT TREATMENT METHODS ARE

24:54.392 --> 24:55.660
PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.128
REMEMBER THE GUY FROM EARLIER,

24:57.128 --> 24:58.396
WHO COMPARED PSYCHEDELIC

24:58.396 --> 24:59.030
TREATMENT TO A BATHTUB FULL OF

24:59.030 --> 25:00.732
PUPPIES?

25:00.732 --> 25:02.133
LISTEN TO HIM DESCRIBE THE

25:02.133 --> 25:03.835
MENTAL HEALTH CARE FROM THE VA.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.670
HE INITIALLY RECEIVED.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.472
I DROVE TO WOMACK ARMY

25:07.472 --> 25:09.007
MEDICAL CENTER AT FORT BRAGG,

25:09.007 --> 25:09.574
AND I SAID I WAS GONNA KILL

25:09.574 --> 25:12.010
MYSELF.

25:12.010 --> 25:19.718
THEY GAVE ME SIX XANAX, TOLD ME

25:19.718 --> 25:20.318
NOT TO TAKE THEM ALL AT THE SAME

25:20.318 --> 25:20.919
TIME BECAUSE IT MIGHT KILL ME.

25:20.919 --> 25:21.853
THEY ASKED IF I HAD GUNS AT

25:21.853 --> 25:22.721
HOME, AND I SAID YES, A LOT, AND

25:22.721 --> 25:23.355
THEY ASKED IF I HAD AMMO, I SAID

25:23.355 --> 25:24.522
YEAH, PLENTY.

25:24.522 --> 25:25.657
AND THEY SAID OKAY WHEN YOU GET

25:25.657 --> 25:27.058
HOME, GIVE ALL YOUR GUNS TO A

25:27.058 --> 25:28.226
NEIGHBOR, THIS IS LIKE 4:00 IN

25:28.226 --> 25:31.129
THE MORNING.

25:31.129 --> 25:32.330
AND THEY SAID COME BACK AFTER

25:32.330 --> 25:33.798
THE HOLIDAYS.

25:33.798 --> 25:35.333
John: OKAY, I KNEW THE VA'S

25:35.333 --> 25:37.002
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE

25:37.002 --> 25:38.403
SUBPAR, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THEY

25:38.403 --> 25:40.372
STOOPED TO "HERE'S A BUNCH OF

25:40.372 --> 25:41.006
WAYS TO KILL YOURSELF, BUT HONOR

25:41.006 --> 25:42.173
SYSTEM, DON'T.

25:42.173 --> 25:43.541
ANYWAY, SEE YOU AFTER THE

25:43.541 --> 25:46.077
SADDEST TIME OF THE YEAR!"

25:46.077 --> 25:48.280
THANKFULLY, THAT GUY SAW SUCH A

25:48.280 --> 25:49.514
PROFOUND CHANGE FROM MDMA

25:49.514 --> 25:50.382
THERAPY THAT HE'S HELPING TO

25:50.382 --> 25:51.650
LEAD A MOVEMENT TO ALLOW

25:51.650 --> 25:53.218
PSYCHEDELICS TO BE USED TO TREAT

25:53.218 --> 25:55.587
CONDITIONS LIKE PTSD, ENLISTING

25:55.587 --> 25:56.621
HELP FROM DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS

25:56.621 --> 25:58.623
LIKE AOC, AND EVEN REPUBLICAN

25:58.623 --> 25:59.991
LEADERS LIKE RICK PERRY AND

25:59.991 --> 26:02.127
DAN CRENSHAW.

26:02.127 --> 26:04.529
AND THAT KIND OF BIPARTISAN

26:04.529 --> 26:05.597
CONSENSUS HAS BROUGHT US TO THE

26:05.597 --> 26:07.432
TIPPING POINT WE'RE AT NOW.

26:07.432 --> 26:08.166
BECAUSE SO FAR, IN THE U.S.,

26:08.166 --> 26:09.434
THESE DRUGS HAVE ONLY LEGALLY

26:09.434 --> 26:11.503
BEEN AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE IN

26:11.503 --> 26:12.771
CLINICAL TRIALS.

26:12.771 --> 26:13.805
BUT OVER THE NEXT YEAR, IT'S

26:13.805 --> 26:15.173
WIDELY ANTICIPATED THAT THE FDA

26:15.173 --> 26:16.908
WILL APPROVE MDMA FOR CLINICAL

26:16.908 --> 26:18.743
USE, WITH PSILOCYBIN EXPECTED TO

26:18.743 --> 26:20.145
FOLLOW A FEW YEARS LATER, AND

26:20.145 --> 26:22.514
MAYBE EVEN LSD ONE DAY.

26:22.514 --> 26:23.982
MEANING WE MAY BE ABOUT TO

26:23.982 --> 26:26.551
FINALLY REALIZE SOME OF THE HUGE

26:26.551 --> 26:28.787
POTENTIAL OF PSYCHEDELICS.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.155
WHICH IS GREAT.

26:30.155 --> 26:31.489
BUT IT'S WORTH BEING VERY

26:31.489 --> 26:34.092
CAREFUL AT THIS POINT TO MAKE

26:34.092 --> 26:35.260
SURE WE DON'T REPEAT PAST

26:35.260 --> 26:36.027
MISTAKES, OR, INDEED, MAKE NEW

26:36.027 --> 26:38.964
ONES.

26:38.964 --> 26:39.597
AND THOSE WHO WORK IN THIS FIELD

26:39.597 --> 26:40.832
POINT TO A FEW BIG AREAS FOR

26:40.832 --> 26:41.299
CAUTION.

26:41.299 --> 26:42.434
THE FIRST CONCERNS HOW

26:42.434 --> 26:43.802
PSYCHEDELICS ARE ADMINISTERED,

26:43.802 --> 26:45.136
AND BY WHOM.

26:45.136 --> 26:46.104
BECAUSE WHILE PEOPLE HAVE USED

26:46.104 --> 26:47.205
THESE DRUGS RECREATIONALLY

26:47.205 --> 26:48.707
FOREVER, AND WILL CONTINUE TO AT

26:48.707 --> 26:50.241
PARTIES, AT RAVES, IN NATURE, OR

26:50.241 --> 26:53.078
TO REALLY LIVEN UP A BAPTISM,

26:53.078 --> 26:56.514
PSYCHEDELIC-ASSISTED THERAPY IS

26:56.514 --> 26:57.882
NOT FOR EVERYONE.

26:57.882 --> 26:58.917
FOR EXAMPLE, ANYONE WITH A

26:58.917 --> 27:00.919
HISTORY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA OR

27:00.919 --> 27:01.486
PSYCHOSIS MAY WANT TO STEER

27:01.486 --> 27:02.354
CLEAR.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.588
AND EVEN IF YOU ARE A GOOD

27:03.588 --> 27:05.757
MATCH, BECAUSE THESE DRUGS CAN

27:05.757 --> 27:07.392
PUT YOU IN AN INCREDIBLY

27:07.392 --> 27:08.927
VULNERABLE STATE, EXPERTS

27:08.927 --> 27:09.928
EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF

27:09.928 --> 27:11.429
TRYING THEM IN A CONTROLLED

27:11.429 --> 27:13.231
SETTING, WHICH IDEALLY WOULD

27:13.231 --> 27:13.832
INVOLVE TWO PEOPLE PRESENT AT

27:13.832 --> 27:15.533
ALL TIMES, AND EVEN VIDEOTAPING

27:15.533 --> 27:17.235
THE SESSION LIKE THAT ONE THAT

27:17.235 --> 27:18.703
YOU JUST SAW EARLIER.

27:18.703 --> 27:19.938
THEY ADVISE THIS NOT JUST FOR

27:19.938 --> 27:21.306
YOUR OWN SAFETY, BUT ALSO

27:21.306 --> 27:22.140
BECAUSE, FOR ALL THEIR POTENTIAL

27:22.140 --> 27:24.275
BENEFITS, THESE DRUGS AREN'T

27:24.275 --> 27:25.310
ALWAYS A BATHTUB FULL OF

27:25.310 --> 27:27.012
PUPPIES.

27:27.012 --> 27:28.980
WE TELL PEOPLE THAT THEIR

27:28.980 --> 27:31.216
EXPERIENCES MAY VARY, FROM VERY

27:31.216 --> 27:33.451
POSITIVE TO, YOU KNOW,

27:33.451 --> 27:34.853
TRANSCENDENT AND LOVELY, TO

27:34.853 --> 27:36.221
LITERALLY HELL REALM

27:36.221 --> 27:37.255
EXPERIENCES.

27:37.255 --> 27:38.656
HELL REALM?

27:38.656 --> 27:40.358
AS FRIGHTENING AN EXPERIENCE

27:40.358 --> 27:42.027
AS YOU HAVE EVER HAD IN YOUR

27:42.027 --> 27:43.461
LIFE.

27:43.461 --> 27:44.863
John: THAT DOES SOUND BAD,

27:44.863 --> 27:46.531
ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR, YOU DON'T

27:46.531 --> 27:48.400
NEED TO TAKE DRUGS TO GET TO THE

27:48.400 --> 27:49.267
HELL REALM.

27:49.267 --> 27:50.835
AFTER ALL, THAT'S WHY AIRPORTS

27:50.835 --> 27:53.605
HAVE SBARRO'S.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.974
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

27:55.974 --> 27:58.109
EVEN THOSE IN STUDIES WHO'VE

27:58.109 --> 27:58.843
REPORTED "HELL-REALM" TYPE

27:58.843 --> 28:00.445
EXPERIENCES HAVE OFTEN STILL

28:00.445 --> 28:02.213
FELT THEY'D BENEFITED FROM THE

28:02.213 --> 28:03.415
TREATMENT.

28:03.415 --> 28:04.049
BUT SAFETY IS NOT THE ONLY WORRY

28:04.049 --> 28:05.250
HERE.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.918
THERE ARE ALSO CONCERNS OVER

28:06.918 --> 28:07.452
ACCESSIBILITY.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.487
THESE TREATMENTS ARE LIKELY TO

28:09.487 --> 28:10.989
BE VERY EXPENSIVE, AND THERE ARE

28:10.989 --> 28:11.689
SOME PLAYERS ANGLING TO MAKE

28:11.689 --> 28:13.324
THEM EVEN MORE SO.

28:13.324 --> 28:15.693
JUST LOOK AT COMPASS PATHWAYS, A

28:15.693 --> 28:16.728
FOR-PROFIT PSYCHEDELIC COMPANY

28:16.728 --> 28:18.563
BACKED BY PETER THIEL.

28:18.563 --> 28:20.031
IT SOUGHT, AND OBTAINED, PATENTS

28:20.031 --> 28:21.800
TO PROTECT ITS FORMULATIONS OF

28:21.800 --> 28:22.700
PSYCHEDELIC COMPOUNDS, WHICH

28:22.700 --> 28:24.402
ALREADY SEEMS PRETTY AGGRESSIVE

28:24.402 --> 28:26.204
FOR A DRUG THAT, REMEMBER, HAS

28:26.204 --> 28:27.205
BEEN AROUND FOR THOUSANDS OF

28:27.205 --> 28:28.306
YEARS.

28:28.306 --> 28:30.575
AND COMPASS'S EXECUTIVES SEEMED

28:30.575 --> 28:31.676
PRETTY DEFENSIVE WHEN THEY WERE

28:31.676 --> 28:33.244
PRESSED ABOUT THIS.

28:33.244 --> 28:34.746
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT

28:34.746 --> 28:36.748
YOUR FORM OF PSILOCYBIN IS NOVEL

28:36.748 --> 28:38.049
AND NON-OBVIOUS?

28:38.049 --> 28:39.217
WELL, IT DOESN'T REALLY

28:39.217 --> 28:40.752
MATTER WHAT WE BELIEVE.

28:40.752 --> 28:42.454
WHAT DOES MATTER IS WHAT THE

28:42.454 --> 28:43.788
U.S. PATENT OFFICE BELIEVES,

28:43.788 --> 28:45.423
WHAT THE UK PATENT OFFICE

28:45.423 --> 28:46.958
BELIEVES, WHAT GERMANY, WHAT

28:46.958 --> 28:47.959
HONG KONG BELIEVES.

28:47.959 --> 28:51.162
AND ALL OF THEM BELIEVE THAT

28:51.162 --> 28:51.830
ACTUALLY IT IS, BECAUSE WE HAVE

28:51.830 --> 28:53.331
THE GRANTED PATENTS.

28:53.331 --> 28:54.265
John: OKAY, BUT, WE SHOULDN'T

28:54.265 --> 28:56.201
NECESSARILY TRUST THE U.S.

28:56.201 --> 28:57.402
PATENT OFFICE AS AN ARBITER OF

28:57.402 --> 28:58.203
GOOD JUDGMENT.

28:58.203 --> 28:59.704
THIS IS THE SAME PLACE THAT

28:59.704 --> 29:01.339
ISSUED PATENTS FOR AN UMBRELLA

29:01.339 --> 29:03.441
FOR YOUR BEER, A TRICYCLE WITH A

29:03.441 --> 29:04.909
LAWNMOWER ATTACHED TO IT, AND A

29:04.909 --> 29:05.810
STICK.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.412
THAT'S IT, JUST A STICK FOR

29:07.412 --> 29:08.546
ANIMALS TO PLAY WITH.

29:08.546 --> 29:09.881
SOMEONE AT THE PATENT OFFICE SAW

29:09.881 --> 29:11.082
THAT AND SAID, "WE'VE NEVER SEEN

29:11.082 --> 29:11.649
A STICK BEFORE!

29:11.649 --> 29:13.785
APPROVED!"

29:13.785 --> 29:15.453
SO TAKE "WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS

29:15.453 --> 29:17.655
IMPORTANT" WITH A PINCH OF SALT.

29:17.655 --> 29:18.189
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE DRUG

29:18.189 --> 29:19.290
FORMULATION.

29:19.290 --> 29:20.892
COMPASS HAS ALSO TRIED TO PATENT

29:20.892 --> 29:22.760
OTHER ASPECTS OF WHAT'S OFTEN

29:22.760 --> 29:24.095
CALLED THE "SET AND SETTING" OF

29:24.095 --> 29:24.729
TREATMENT, FROM THE ROOM

29:24.729 --> 29:27.165

29:29.467 --> 29:31.069

29:31.069 --> 29:41.246

29:47.685 --> 29:49.087
SUIT WHILE SITTING AT A DESK.

29:49.087 --> 29:49.721
I'M CLEARLY NOT THE ONLY PERSON

29:49.721 --> 29:50.054
WHO DOES THIS.

29:50.054 --> 29:50.722
NOW IF I WERE TO PATENT THE

29:50.722 --> 29:51.656
CONCEPT OF DOING THAT WHILE

29:51.656 --> 29:52.290
MAKING YOU WONDER WHY THE FUCK

29:52.290 --> 29:53.525
THE TV IS STILL ON AFTER

29:53.525 --> 29:55.994
"THE LAST OF US" HAS ENDED.

29:55.994 --> 29:57.295
THAT WOULD BE UNIQUE MY MY

29:57.295 --> 29:58.563
THING.

29:58.563 --> 29:59.164
NOW, THOSE "SET AND SETTING"

29:59.164 --> 29:59.764
PATENT APPLICATIONS ARE STILL

29:59.764 --> 30:00.999
PENDING, BUT THE VERY FACT THEY

30:00.999 --> 30:01.966
APPLIED FOR THEM AT ALL IS A

30:01.966 --> 30:02.567
PRETTY CLEAR SIGN OF JUST HOW

30:02.567 --> 30:03.568
AGGRESSIVE COMPANIES IN THIS

30:03.568 --> 30:04.068
SPACE INTEND TO BE GOING

30:04.068 --> 30:10.041
FORWARD.

30:10.041 --> 30:10.542
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THESE

30:10.542 --> 30:11.176
TREATMENTS ARE GOING TO BE CHEAP

30:11.176 --> 30:12.243
TO START WITH.

30:12.243 --> 30:13.478
EXPERTS PROJECT A COURSE OF

30:13.478 --> 30:14.946
PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY IS LIKELY TO

30:14.946 --> 30:15.847
COST UPWARDS OF $15,000.

30:15.847 --> 30:16.848
AND GIVEN THAT, AS WE'VE

30:16.848 --> 30:18.650
DISCUSSED BEFORE ON THIS SHOW,

30:18.650 --> 30:19.784
THERE'S CURRENTLY A MASSIVE

30:19.784 --> 30:20.385
SHORTAGE OF MENTAL-HEALTH

30:20.385 --> 30:21.719
PROFESSIONALS IN THIS COUNTRY,

30:21.719 --> 30:23.154
DUE IN PART TO HOW FUCKED-UP OUR

30:23.154 --> 30:24.556
HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM IS.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.157
YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS COULD

30:26.157 --> 30:28.526
EASILY BECOME A BIG MESS, OR

30:28.526 --> 30:29.761
ONLY ACCESSIBLE TO THE

30:29.761 --> 30:34.065
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS.

30:34.065 --> 30:34.666
SO THERE'S A LOT TO FIGURE OUT

30:34.666 --> 30:36.367
HERE EVEN BEFORE YOU GET TO

30:36.367 --> 30:37.635
QUESTIONS LIKE, "WHO'LL REGULATE

30:37.635 --> 30:38.903
PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY?"

30:38.903 --> 30:40.939
BECAUSE THE FDA IS IN CHARGE OF

30:40.939 --> 30:42.140
DRUGS, BUT IT DOESN'T REGULATE

30:42.140 --> 30:43.675
THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.109
NOW, STATE LAWS COULD COVER IT,

30:45.109 --> 30:46.945
STATE REGULATORY AGENCIES COULD,

30:46.945 --> 30:47.545
OR PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

30:47.545 --> 30:49.714
MIGHT.

30:49.714 --> 30:52.116
BUT SOMEONE HAS TO, BECAUSE IF

30:52.116 --> 30:52.750
THEY DON'T, PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO

30:52.750 --> 30:54.152
GET HURT, WHICH COULD SEND US

30:54.152 --> 30:56.888
ALL THE WAY BACK TO

30:56.888 --> 30:57.488
FEARMONGERING, BANS, AND

30:57.488 --> 30:59.324
RESEARCH GETTING PUT ON ICE.

30:59.324 --> 31:00.625
WHICH IS THE LAST THING WE

31:00.625 --> 31:02.160
SHOULD WANT TO HAPPEN.

31:02.160 --> 31:02.994
BECAUSE THERE IS MASSIVE

31:02.994 --> 31:05.396
POTENTIAL HERE.

31:05.396 --> 31:06.431
THESE TREATMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT

31:06.431 --> 31:08.933
THEY CAN HAVE LASTING EFFECTS.

31:26.184 --> 31:27.085
THERE WAS A PROBLEM THAT I HAD

31:27.085 --> 31:28.886
TO RESOLVE, AND I FACED IT, AND

31:28.886 --> 31:30.555
