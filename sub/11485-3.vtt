<i>If you've got bugs</i>

00:10.493 --> 00:12.723
<i>If you've got ants</i>

00:13.496 --> 00:17.262
<i>If you've got bugs and flies and
slugs and things that crawl</i>

00:20.937 --> 00:22.097
We're here!

00:22.172 --> 00:24.834
- Mom, come see my room!
- I'll be right there, honey!

00:24.941 --> 00:26.738
- Hey, Uncle Charlie.
- Hi, shorty!

00:26.843 --> 00:28.140
Hello, Charlie.

00:28.244 --> 00:30.269
Hi, Judith. What're you doing here?

00:30.346 --> 00:33.076
If you must know, I'm here to help
Jake set up his room,

00:33.149 --> 00:34.878
so he feels like nothing's changed.

00:34.951 --> 00:37.943
Really? You don't think he'll notice
his dad's living here

00:38.021 --> 00:39.318
and his mom's dating chicks?

00:40.957 --> 00:44.085
Could you say that a little louder?
Jake might not have heard you.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.185
Just for the record, I'm not
dating anyone,

00:46.262 --> 00:49.754
and I threw your brother out 'cause
he was sucking the life out of me.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.098
Could you say that a little louder?

00:53.269 --> 00:55.499
Uncle Charlie hasn't met Porky yet!

00:55.605 --> 00:58.597
I don't suppose that's a
Rubenesque 19-year-old girl.

00:59.175 --> 01:01.370
Porky's his pet guinea pig.

01:01.444 --> 01:04.140
You're bringing vermin into my house?

01:04.781 --> 01:07.477
Uncle Charlie, check him out!
Isn't he awesome?

01:07.550 --> 01:08.744
Yeah.

01:08.818 --> 01:11.218
See those little black things?
That's his poop.

01:13.690 --> 01:14.987
Awesome.

01:16.059 --> 01:19.688
I don't want him in the water this
weekend. He might have an ear infection.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.023
Oh, Mom.

01:21.097 --> 01:24.260
No, it's okay, pal.
We can go to Disneyland.

01:24.367 --> 01:25.857
We'll have a great weekend.

01:25.935 --> 01:29.496
We can play miniature golf, go bowling,
bike riding, whatever you want.

01:29.572 --> 01:33.030
Alan, relax, you're starting to
sound like a tampon commercial.

01:36.780 --> 01:39.010
Jake, why don't you go put Porky
in your room?

01:39.082 --> 01:40.379
Okay.

01:40.917 --> 01:45.081
Alan, I'm very concerned. He's just a child.
I don't know if he can deal with this.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.782
Give your son some credit.
He's an incredible kid.

01:47.924 --> 01:49.915
I was talking about you.

01:51.795 --> 01:53.558
- That's fair.
- Yeah.

02:14.584 --> 02:18.816
Charlie? That strange lady
from down the beach is back.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.953
Yeah, she's here to baby-sit.

02:26.729 --> 02:28.253
Come again?

02:28.965 --> 02:30.899
I thought we'd go out and have a drink.

02:30.967 --> 02:34.562
You want me to leave my son with the
whack job who's been stalking you

02:34.637 --> 02:36.628
since your one night stand?

02:36.840 --> 02:39.900
You try and find a
baby-sitter on a Friday night.

02:40.510 --> 02:44.241
It's okay, Alan.
Charlie and I talked and I understand

02:44.314 --> 02:47.340
that we're just friends,
and that it is not okay for me

02:47.417 --> 02:50.147
to sneak into his house
and lick all his silverware.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.987
As reassuring as that sounds,
we can't go out tonight.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.258
We're getting up early to go to Disneyland.

03:03.333 --> 03:04.391
We?

03:04.467 --> 03:07.095
Yeah. I thought that maybe
you'd want to come with us.

03:07.170 --> 03:10.765
Alan, I'm not thrilled about having one
small rodent in my house.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.934
Why would I drive fifty miles
to see their kingdom?

03:15.511 --> 03:17.308
I'll go!

03:19.148 --> 03:23.346
Maybe some other time, Rose. It turns out
we're not gonna need a babysitter tonight.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.786
No problem.
I'm gonna take this seat cushion, okay?

03:29.459 --> 03:31.188
Knock yourself out.

03:32.729 --> 03:34.629
Why does she want your seat cushion?

03:34.697 --> 03:38.064
I don't know why she brought it,
I don't know why she's taking it.

03:40.536 --> 03:42.128
Okay, then, I'll see you later.

03:42.205 --> 03:44.537
Wait, you're still going out?

03:44.741 --> 03:46.333
Yeah. Why?

03:46.542 --> 03:49.477
I thought you wanted us
to spend some time together.

03:49.545 --> 03:50.705
Here?

03:53.383 --> 03:54.509
Okay.

04:12.902 --> 04:14.631
What're you thinking? 10, 15 minutes?

04:14.704 --> 04:15.898
- Go.
- Thanks.

04:24.447 --> 04:26.711
Good morning, Uncle Charlie.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.775
Morning, Porky.

04:29.419 --> 04:31.546
Did you have sweet dreams?

04:33.423 --> 04:37.086
Jake, rule number one.
Uncle Charlie does not like

04:37.160 --> 04:40.288
to start his day with a
squealing creature in his face.

04:40.396 --> 04:43.797
Sorry. Grandma's here.
She wants you to come down.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.901
Okay, you're not listening.

04:46.436 --> 04:48.097
Rule number one...

04:50.373 --> 04:53.433
This is a list of the top divorce
attorneys in Los Angeles.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.807
I've made appointments for you
with each of them.

04:55.912 --> 04:58.938
I don't need to meet any attorneys.
I'm not getting a divorce.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.073
I'm sure you don't think so.

05:03.619 --> 05:05.951
The point is, if you consult with all

05:06.055 --> 05:10.389
the good lawyers, it's a conflict of
interest for them to represent Judith.

05:10.493 --> 05:13.519
She'll be stuck with some ambulance-
chasing clown from Van Nuys

05:13.596 --> 05:15.860
who will fold like an origami swan.

05:16.466 --> 05:17.933
I don't want this to be...

05:18.001 --> 05:20.162
Mommy busted her hump on this, Alan.

05:23.606 --> 05:24.664
Thank you?

05:26.409 --> 05:27.808
Morning.

05:30.079 --> 05:32.513
Is that all you have to say for yourself?

05:33.783 --> 05:36.149
You haven't returned any
of my calls this week.

05:36.252 --> 05:40.655
It's all I can do to not imagine you
lying dead in a ditch somewhere.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.456
Right back at ya, Mom.

05:48.131 --> 05:49.621
What did you want to talk about?

05:49.699 --> 05:52.031
Too late. I'm not speaking to you.

05:52.135 --> 05:54.501
- All right.
- Would you like to know why?

05:55.204 --> 05:57.365
No, I trust your judgment.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.875
Because when your
brother's marriage ended,

06:00.977 --> 06:03.810
yes, I know, Alan, blah, blah, blah,

06:04.714 --> 06:08.377
and he chose to move in here, your
coldness towards your mother

06:08.484 --> 06:11.476
became more than just the behavior
of an ungrateful son.

06:11.554 --> 06:15.650
It's now an obstacle to my spending
quality time with my beloved grandchild.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.857
Are you coming to Disneyland with us,
Grandma?

06:19.962 --> 06:23.227
Darling, Grandma doesn't do Anaheim.

06:24.467 --> 06:28.369
We'd better hit the road. Try to beat
the traffic. Thanks for dropping by, Mom.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.268
Let's go, Jake. I'll race you to the car.

06:30.373 --> 06:32.170
- Bye, Grandma. Bye, Uncle Charlie.
- Bye.

06:38.014 --> 06:40.005
Wait for me, I'm going!

07:02.271 --> 07:06.970
Come on, boy. Heel. Stay. Now, stay.

07:07.076 --> 07:11.103
Who's a good dog? Oh, yeah!

07:12.315 --> 07:14.408
Hey, Jake, you want to take him?

07:14.484 --> 07:16.611
Whatever. Come on, leash.

07:19.222 --> 07:23.124
Get ready for bed.
I'll be right in to tuck you in.

07:25.761 --> 07:28.753
Happiest place on earth,
my snow white ass.

07:34.604 --> 07:36.333
I had a good time.

07:38.074 --> 07:41.737
Oh, really? Which part did you like best?

07:41.878 --> 07:45.575
The equatorial heat, the endless
lines, or the large German woman that

07:45.648 --> 07:47.616
threw up on me in the Teacup?

07:50.086 --> 07:54.853
Maybe things could have gone smoother,
but tomorrow's gonna make up for it.

07:55.291 --> 07:59.193
Alan, you could get us all laid
tomorrow, it's not gonna make up for it.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.527
Hey, sleepy head. You're just in time.
Your pancakes are almost ready.

08:08.604 --> 08:10.003
I'm not hungry.

08:10.439 --> 08:13.602
Not hungry?
Come on, you've gotta fuel up that engine.

08:13.676 --> 08:17.510
- We've got a big day planned.
- My ear hurts.

08:18.314 --> 08:19.542
Oh, no.

08:20.850 --> 08:24.342
Let me feel. Yeah, you're a little warm.

08:25.054 --> 08:27.682
Probably another ear infection.

08:27.957 --> 08:29.982
Okay, new plan.

08:30.059 --> 08:33.551
We'll get you on the antibiotics,
we'll watch a little TV,

08:33.629 --> 08:36.563
play some video games.
We'll have a great day.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.395
I want to go home.

08:38.501 --> 08:40.366
You are home.

08:40.469 --> 08:43.029
I know, but the real one, with Mom.

08:47.677 --> 08:51.238
Okay, I understand that.
You know, when a guy's feeling sick,

08:51.314 --> 08:53.646
he needs his mom. Right, Charlie?

08:53.716 --> 08:54.740
Well,

08:57.386 --> 08:59.217
I may not be the one to ask.

09:00.389 --> 09:03.984
Okay, I'll, call your mom and,
tell her we're on our way.

09:06.596 --> 09:10.327
All right, it's just you and me now.
Are you really sick, or are you just

09:10.399 --> 09:12.924
fakin' it to get out of another
fun-filled afternoon?

09:13.035 --> 09:14.662
I'm really sick.

09:14.737 --> 09:17.365
Just checking.
Because I was gonna fake it.

09:22.078 --> 09:27.243
<i>If your home is bug infested
filled with spiders, flies or gnats</i>

09:27.383 --> 09:33.288
<i>All our sprays are safety tested
we kill vermin, not your cats</i>

09:35.291 --> 09:37.782
Hey. How's the jingle coming?

09:38.394 --> 09:41.625
The lyrics are fine,
the music needs a little work.

09:43.232 --> 09:44.256
How's Jake?

09:44.467 --> 09:47.402
He'll be okay.
I stayed over at the house a little while.

09:47.470 --> 09:50.701
We watched some movies,
I made us some soup and a couple of

09:50.773 --> 09:54.607
sandwiches,
and Judith suggested I take mine to go.

09:55.778 --> 09:57.143
Suggested?

09:57.413 --> 10:00.576
She started my car and threw my
sandwich in the back seat.

10:01.117 --> 10:02.414
That's rough.

10:03.252 --> 10:06.653
Listen, I'm afraid I got some more
bad news for you.

10:06.756 --> 10:09.816
No, gosh, I forgot to bring Porky back.

10:10.593 --> 10:14.791
See, that's the thing.
Nothing's bringing Porky back.

10:16.599 --> 10:19.033
What? Porky's dead?

10:19.402 --> 10:22.098
"Buh-dee, buh-dee, buh-dee,
that's all folks!"

10:25.875 --> 10:27.206
Oh, God.

10:31.914 --> 10:35.941
It's okay.
We can get Jake another guinea pig.

10:36.385 --> 10:40.219
Jake will be fine.
This is his fourth Porky in three years.

10:42.625 --> 10:45.287
He goes through them faster than shoes.

10:46.329 --> 10:48.627
No, this is about my life.

10:49.965 --> 10:51.489
Everything is going to hell.

10:52.468 --> 10:56.302
Okay, well, don't cry.
We can still be friends.

10:59.442 --> 11:00.602
What?

11:00.776 --> 11:04.473
I'm sorry. It's the only thing I know to
say when someone cries around here.

11:07.950 --> 11:09.815
I am so sorry, Porky.

11:10.986 --> 11:13.511
You just kept running around
in your little cage,

11:13.622 --> 11:17.183
trying to make everybody
happy. And what do you get?

11:18.160 --> 11:19.650
You get dead.

11:21.497 --> 11:24.466
You do know the pig can't hear you, right?

11:24.934 --> 11:28.028
Don't you get it? I am the pig!

11:28.337 --> 11:33.365
Okay. I'm just asking, because your
reaction doesn't seem very healthy to me.

11:33.476 --> 11:35.706
And what do you think would be healthy,
Charlie?

11:35.811 --> 11:39.338
I don't know. Why don't we toss Porky
in the ocean and go get bombed?

11:43.753 --> 11:46.779
How could you?

11:48.591 --> 11:49.615
Okay.

11:59.568 --> 12:03.163
Toss him in the ocean. Very clever.

12:04.206 --> 12:06.731
Who knew pelicans eat guinea pigs?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.844
What's happening?

12:16.552 --> 12:19.146
Sunday's Tequila Night at Pavlov's.

12:19.221 --> 12:21.689
Every time the bell rings,
you gotta take a shot.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.216
Why?

12:24.093 --> 12:26.027
'Cause the bell rings.

12:27.396 --> 12:28.522
Okay.

12:28.597 --> 12:30.497
You gotta bark first.

12:37.239 --> 12:38.263
Charlie,

12:38.741 --> 12:43.110
when my son looked at me and told me
that he wanted to go "home",

12:44.513 --> 12:46.105
that broke my heart.

12:46.215 --> 12:47.443
I saw.

12:47.583 --> 12:51.212
You know, my kid is sick,
and I can't even be with him.

12:51.520 --> 12:56.116
You know, I'm a failure, Charlie.
I'm a failure as a father,

12:56.225 --> 12:57.624
I'm a failure as a husband.

12:57.726 --> 13:02.459
You didn't fail.
First of all, that little boy loves you.

13:02.531 --> 13:05.659
Second of all, just because your wife
decides she doesn't like

13:05.734 --> 13:08.532
sleeping with men, doesn't mean
you've failed as a husband.

13:08.604 --> 13:11.198
Although, I wouldn't brag about it.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.570
You're right. This is Judith's fault.

13:14.643 --> 13:17.942
She's the one who breached our
marriage contract asunder.

13:18.080 --> 13:22.847
And I let her make decisions that
should have been in my dominion.

13:24.453 --> 13:28.389
Alan, people are gonna do whatever
they're gonna do in this world.

13:28.624 --> 13:32.116
The only thing a man can control
is his own actions.

13:42.104 --> 13:44.470
I don't remember where we left our car.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.372
This isn't our car?

13:50.579 --> 13:51.637
Where to?

13:51.747 --> 13:52.975
Home.

13:53.616 --> 13:56.585
- And that would be?
- Sherman Oaks.

13:56.652 --> 13:58.279
We don't live in Sherman Oaks.

13:58.387 --> 14:01.481
I do. I am a Sherman Oaksian and I am

14:01.557 --> 14:04.424
going home for as to reclaim my home.

14:05.995 --> 14:10.455
That's a very bad idea.
I'll tell you what's a good idea.

14:10.733 --> 14:14.999
Chili cheese fries and a large root
beer. With chili cheese fries.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.637
And girls.

14:19.174 --> 14:24.077
No. I am going home to my wife

14:24.146 --> 14:26.512
to impose my dominion over her.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.846
Yeah. The lesbians love that.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.016
Driver! Sherman Oaks!

14:36.258 --> 14:39.284
1167, Bonnie Meadow Drive.

14:39.528 --> 14:43.259
Goodbye, Charlie.
I'll be back for my things tomorrow.

14:43.332 --> 14:46.199
Thank you, driver. You've been most kind.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.440
So, back to Malibu?

14:56.879 --> 14:59.006
No. Let's give it a second.

15:03.018 --> 15:07.785
Did you know they put
chocolate pudding in tubes now?

15:08.057 --> 15:10.890
No, I did not.

15:11.994 --> 15:15.794
They do. My nephew eats them.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.293
They're surprisingly good.

15:24.139 --> 15:26.471
You know, that's an interesting
sibling dynamic

15:26.542 --> 15:28.510
you've got goin' with your brother there.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.641
You get that I'm loaded, right?

15:36.552 --> 15:38.144
Drive!

15:43.559 --> 15:47.120
So? How'd it go?

15:49.031 --> 15:52.228
She chased me out of the house
with a golf club.

15:55.504 --> 15:57.233
Taking up golf already.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.971
What was it like, a six iron?

16:01.043 --> 16:02.635
What difference does it make?

16:02.711 --> 16:05.908
I just want to be able to
tell the story accurately.

16:15.157 --> 16:16.681
It's not funny.

16:16.925 --> 16:19.223
Then why are you laughing?

16:19.528 --> 16:21.689
Because I don't know what else to do.

16:23.766 --> 16:26.166
I wish I could ask Dad for advice.

16:26.669 --> 16:29.263
You'd go to Dad for marriage counseling?

16:29.838 --> 16:33.171
Alan, our father committed suicide
to get away from our mother.

16:33.242 --> 16:37.178
What're you talking about? Dad didn't
commit suicide. He died of food poisoning.

16:37.246 --> 16:41.046
I maintain that he knew the fish was
bad, but he kept eating it anyway.

16:42.551 --> 16:45.452
Your mother sounds like
a real piece of work.

16:46.555 --> 16:49.456
You have no idea, my friend.

16:49.558 --> 16:54.018
My mother took my baby brother
and dipped him in sissy sauce

16:54.797 --> 16:58.096
and turned him into the people-pleasing
control freak you see today.

16:58.200 --> 17:02.534
That's right!
And she made him so scared of intimacy

17:02.604 --> 17:05.698
that he has just this
endless stream of gorgeous girls

17:05.773 --> 17:07.742
running in and out of his life.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.175
Damn her.

17:11.780 --> 17:16.615
You know, many psychologists agree,
until the core maternal relationship

17:16.685 --> 17:21.520
is resolved, most men are doomed to
repeat dysfunctional childhood patterns.

17:22.590 --> 17:25.025
Just drive the cab, Doctor Phil.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.431
You know what, Charlie? He's not wrong.

17:29.531 --> 17:32.125
At some point, we have to stand up to her.

17:32.234 --> 17:34.634
Look who's got beer muscles
all of a sudden.

17:34.737 --> 17:36.932
No, I'm serious. Come on. Right now.

17:37.039 --> 17:41.135
Let's confront her. You with me? Come on!

17:41.443 --> 17:43.206
Oh, my God.

17:44.046 --> 17:47.140
I can't believe it!
You really are afraid of Mom!

17:47.483 --> 17:48.814
I am not.

17:49.084 --> 17:51.575
All these years,
I thought you were so cool.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.121
But you're just a big clucking chicken!

17:54.223 --> 17:55.247
Ouch.

17:56.692 --> 17:57.784
Ouch?

17:57.860 --> 18:01.125
Okay, that's it. We have a new destination.

18:01.363 --> 18:02.921
Beverly Hills.

18:03.198 --> 18:04.756
You got an address?

18:04.833 --> 18:08.792
Just go east on Sunset until
you reach the Gates of Hell.

18:12.107 --> 18:13.836
She'll buzz us in.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.209
I can't wait to see her face.

18:20.315 --> 18:22.044
She's gonna freak.

18:23.485 --> 18:24.884
You ready?

18:24.987 --> 18:27.319
Ring the bell.

18:37.966 --> 18:39.331
<i>Who is it?</i>

18:40.202 --> 18:41.794
It's your sons!

18:42.604 --> 18:44.265
Charlie and Alan.

18:49.344 --> 18:50.641
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

18:52.948 --> 18:55.940
<i>Dear God. Hold on. I'll be right there.</i>

18:56.852 --> 18:59.821
Okay, what exactly are we
gonna say to her?

19:00.322 --> 19:03.348
Now you ask? This was your safari.

19:03.692 --> 19:07.128
We're here to resolve the core
maternal thing.

19:07.196 --> 19:09.494
Wait, I'll go ask the cabbie.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.723
Nice try.

19:18.140 --> 19:20.165
Somebody better be dead.

19:21.643 --> 19:23.133
Porky's dead.

19:26.148 --> 19:29.015
And you completely screwed up our lives.

19:29.651 --> 19:30.675
I'm sorry?

19:30.752 --> 19:33.186
- That's good enough for me.
- Yeah, I'm good.

19:34.556 --> 19:36.148
Driver, drive!

19:44.700 --> 19:46.361
Good morning, sunshine.

19:48.770 --> 19:52.934
God. Close the drapes.

19:55.744 --> 20:00.272
Hey, what's this?
"Release and indemnification form. "

20:01.250 --> 20:02.444
What?

20:02.784 --> 20:05.753
Were you on some kind of
television show last night?

20:06.221 --> 20:07.381
I don't think so.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.788
You and your brother signed it.

20:09.892 --> 20:11.723
Let me see that.

20:14.196 --> 20:15.220
Alan.

20:17.199 --> 20:19.531
Alan, wake up.

20:23.405 --> 20:25.100
We got a problem.

20:28.844 --> 20:30.744
"Taxicab Confessions?"

20:33.715 --> 20:35.706
<i>If you've got bugs</i>

20:36.118 --> 20:38.552
<i>If you've got ants</i>

20:39.288 --> 20:42.746
<i>If you've got bugs and flies and
slugs and things that crawl</i>

20:45.060 --> 20:46.584
<i>Ain't that Beethoven?</i>

20:49.865 --> 20:54.359
<i>I don't even know how my wife
is gonna be a lesbian.</i>

20:55.304 --> 20:57.272
<i>She hates oral sex.</i>

20:57.539 --> 20:58.972
<i>Hates it!</i>

21:27.169 --> 21:28.363
