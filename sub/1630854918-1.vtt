WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:04.587
<i>- Hi, babe.</i>
- Hey, sweetie, listen.

00:04.587 --> 00:06.589
I'm sorry, but I got some bad news.

00:06.589 --> 00:08.466
The conference is running long.

00:08.466 --> 00:10.218
Seriously?

00:10.218 --> 00:12.804
I was making your favorite
casserole for dinner.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.097
The kids are gonna be bummed.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.849
I know, I know, and I'm sorry,

00:15.849 --> 00:17.475
but it's a sales banquet.

00:17.475 --> 00:18.893
<i>And you know Luther-- he thinks</i>

00:18.893 --> 00:20.520
<i>no one's gonna buy a computer server</i>

00:20.520 --> 00:22.522
unless you eat
a rubber chicken breast with them.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.149
It's okay,

00:24.149 --> 00:26.151
I have a million linguistics finals
to grade.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.987
But I was really
looking forward to seeing you.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.448
No, I know, honey,
but it's-it's a big project.

00:31.448 --> 00:34.117
<i>If I get this commission,
we can get the dishwasher fixed.</i>

00:34.117 --> 00:35.285
Okay.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.661
<i>Well, have fun in Cleveland.</i>

00:36.661 --> 00:38.663
Who doesn't have fun in Cleveland?

00:38.663 --> 00:40.790
Look, I got to go.
The banquet's about to start.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.417
Please don't be mad.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.960
I'm not mad.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.712
Try to enjoy your sales banquet chicken.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
I will. I love you.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.215
<i>- Kisses.</i>
- More kisses.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.386
- Do you need a hug?
- Aw. "Kisses.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.597
Please don't be mad at me"? Seriously?

00:55.597 --> 00:57.849
Let's put a hold on the toxic masculinity.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.267
We're behind schedule.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.935
I love my wife.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.729
Give me a break.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.865
Okay, mission review.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.700
You go in, kidnap the weapons dealer

01:15.700 --> 01:17.035
<i>and get him out. Ambulance arrives</i>

01:17.035 --> 01:18.870
<i>in exactly 22 minutes.</i>

01:18.870 --> 01:20.371
<i>Any questions?</i>

01:20.371 --> 01:21.956
If we're unclear on the mission

01:21.956 --> 01:24.417
<i>at this point, Gib,
I'm pretty sure we're dead.</i>

01:24.417 --> 01:25.794
Aw.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.556
<i>We're in place. Initiate.</i>

01:44.479 --> 01:46.147
Luther, buddy, you're up.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.237
Man, I love this thing.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.321
It slices, it dices,

01:53.321 --> 01:55.615
it cuts through carbon steel bars,

01:55.615 --> 01:58.868
and it's still sharp
enough to slice through a tomato.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.453
Boys and their toys.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.955
My next op, I need a smaller gun

02:01.955 --> 02:03.581
or a bigger suit.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.083
<i>Uh, you're grabbing one of the biggest</i>

02:05.083 --> 02:06.626
weapons dealers in the hemisphere.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.044
<i>It's not supposed to be easy.</i>

02:08.044 --> 02:10.463
Easy for you to say, Gib.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.965
You don't have to carry
a 200-pound bad guy

02:11.965 --> 02:14.259
- halfway across the Caribbean.
<i>- Aw.</i>

02:14.259 --> 02:16.302
Field agents get all the glory

02:16.302 --> 02:18.346
and all the lower back pain.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.889
<i>Maybe you'll remember that the next time</i>

02:19.889 --> 02:22.767
<i>you make fun of me
for sitting in a van all day.</i>

02:22.767 --> 02:24.769
Have all you want.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.604
Your dad's not gonna
make it to dinner, so...

02:26.604 --> 02:28.148
What, he's not?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.941
Yeah, I thought he was
supposed to be home tonight.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.734
Uh, I guess he got stuck

02:31.734 --> 02:33.611
at a sales conference in Cleveland.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.196
Poor Dad.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.115
Seriously, when is he not

02:37.115 --> 02:38.992
- stuck at a sales conference?
- I know it happens

02:38.992 --> 02:41.411
a lot, but you know what your dad says.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.955
"Computers don't sell themselves."

02:43.955 --> 02:45.874
Yeah, but

02:45.874 --> 02:47.750
he should still have a life. I mean,

02:47.750 --> 02:49.627
it's not like he's saving the world.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.338
Can't he just tell them no?

02:52.338 --> 02:54.632
I wish.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.052
Oh, boy. This is not good.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.721
Trilby didn't tell us
who's on the guest list.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.848
It's a who's who of global bad guys.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.100
Gib, why didn't we get a full report

03:04.100 --> 03:07.020
on what we're walking into?
This is a nightmare.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.230
<i>Talk to the boss, man. I just work here.</i>

03:09.230 --> 03:11.191
<i>- What's your approach?</i>
- The catering van

03:11.191 --> 03:12.859
with the grill
at the back side of the house.

03:13.026 --> 03:13.943
All right, let's roll.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.285
<i>♪ Ya-hee, icky thump, who'd have thunk ♪</i>

03:22.285 --> 03:25.079

<i>♪ Redhead señorita

- Okay, guys,</i>

03:34.923 --> 03:36.299
once you clear the catering area,

03:36.299 --> 03:37.550
you're gonna want to scale

03:37.550 --> 03:39.677
the second balcony on your...

03:39.677 --> 03:41.554
left. On your left.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.139
Rand's office is on the far east

03:43.139 --> 03:44.599
<i>end of the home.</i>

03:44.599 --> 03:45.767
<i>Remember,</i>

03:45.767 --> 03:47.185
once you get inside, any sound

03:47.185 --> 03:48.603
over a normal speaking voice

03:48.603 --> 03:49.729
will set off the alarm.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.147
<i>So, when you grab him,</i>

03:51.147 --> 03:52.565
<i>no yelling, no shooting.</i>

03:52.565 --> 03:54.192
<i>Harry, keep it quiet.</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:04.661
Excuse me.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.204
What are you doing in here?

04:06.204 --> 04:08.081
I was getting bored downstairs.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.416
Just looking for some fun.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.335

04:12.335 --> 04:15.338

04:27.684 --> 04:29.352
Harry, what was that?

04:29.352 --> 04:32.438
<i>I told you, nothing over
a normal speaking voice.</i>

04:34.232 --> 04:36.025
It's fine, won't happen again.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.443
M-Make sure it doesn't.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.654
We're about one wet fart
away from dead, okay?

04:39.654 --> 04:42.407
<i>Now, get in your uniforms,
get that stretcher set up</i>

04:42.407 --> 04:44.701
<i>and kill the security system.
We got to move.</i>

04:50.498 --> 04:52.375
<i>Luther, you're gonna find the keypad</i>

04:52.375 --> 04:54.419
<i>for the security system
behind the painting</i>

04:54.419 --> 04:56.713
<i>on the west wall. Get that thing decoded</i>

04:56.713 --> 04:58.589
<i>and shut it down.</i>

04:58.589 --> 05:01.009
Also, Harry,

05:01.009 --> 05:02.218
Helen just texted

05:02.218 --> 05:03.636
to remind you about her work barbecue.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.847
"I didn't forget.
I'm all over it."

05:05.847 --> 05:07.181
<i>Heart emoji.</i>

05:07.181 --> 05:09.475
<i>Kissy heart emoji. Send pic three.</i>

05:10.685 --> 05:11.936
Pic four is way cuter.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.897
Pic three.

05:19.777 --> 05:21.237
What a goofball.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.197
Mr. Rand?

05:23.197 --> 05:24.824
You all right?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.075
Guys, what's going on?

05:29.829 --> 05:31.497
Psst.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.665
Harry.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.344
What's-what's happening?

05:44.344 --> 05:45.762
<i>- Luther?</i>
- He's having a pillow fight

05:45.762 --> 05:47.221
with this guy in front of my face.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.431
There's nothing I can do.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.600
Maria.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.938
- Guys, you're peaking out here.
<i>- It's fine.</i>

05:55.938 --> 05:57.398
Harry's got it under control.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.077
Go, go, go! Get out of there!

06:09.077 --> 06:10.745
New plan. Corner of the house,

06:10.870 --> 06:12.038
the catering van with the grill.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.873
- Go. Go!
- Get out! Get out!

06:19.545 --> 06:21.005
- Dana.
- Mom!

06:21.005 --> 06:23.091
Can you knock next time, please?

06:23.091 --> 06:25.301
I'm just checking on your homework.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.386
I already did it.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.638
I was just looking at my snow globes.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.431
Okay.

06:30.431 --> 06:31.641
All right.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.309
- Love you.
- I love you.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.644
Good night.

06:36.104 --> 06:39.399
No. No, no, no.
Maria, you've got to drive faster.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.984
I got three guards on motorcycles
coming in hot.

06:41.984 --> 06:45.071
It's a catering van. It can't go faster.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.246
<i>Harry, can you take them out?</i>

06:53.246 --> 06:54.455
I'm trying.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.374
I got a giant grill
full of T-bones in the way.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.389
No, no, no, no, no.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.266
Harry, they're gaining on you.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.351
Yeah, Gib, I see that. I can't get a shot.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.436
<i>I got an idea.</i>

07:16.436 --> 07:17.854
The laser cutter-- give it to me.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.445
Hey, sweetie.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.155
Hey. I'm about to go to bed.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.489
Just playing a video game.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.491
Okay, nothing too violent, I hope.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.201
I know. No violence.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.437
<i>Oh, shame to waste all those T-bones.</i>

07:59.437 --> 08:01.772
<i>All right, everybody, let's go home.</i>

08:08.196 --> 08:10.198
Okay, cover story review.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.532
Where'd you stay?

08:11.532 --> 08:12.783
Cleveland Ramada, room 713.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.118
How'd you get the bruise on your arm?

08:14.118 --> 08:15.119
Luther's bag fell out of

08:15.244 --> 08:16.579
the overhead compartment on the plane.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.705
Good, good.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.123
Your plane was United 238.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.583
Breakfast was a Denver omelet.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.544
Here are your presents.
Where'd you get them?

08:23.544 --> 08:25.296
Airport gift shop next to the Starbucks

08:25.296 --> 08:27.256
where I got my muffin.
Receipts are in my wallet.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.466
I got it, okay?

08:28.466 --> 08:29.759
Hey, don't get mad at me.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.428
I don't need a cover story.
You're the genius

08:32.428 --> 08:34.096
who decided to get married
and have a family.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.516
Yeah, well...

08:36.516 --> 08:38.017
what's the point of saving the world

08:38.017 --> 08:39.852
if you're not doing it
for the people you love?

08:39.852 --> 08:42.146
That's really touching, Harry.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.856
Maybe if the spy thing doesn't work out

08:43.856 --> 08:45.233
you could write greeting cards.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.235
I know a guy.

08:49.612 --> 08:50.947
I'll see you later.

08:50.947 --> 08:51.948
Good luck.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.951
Jakey, isn't this your textbook?

08:54.951 --> 08:56.327
Yeah, I was looking for that. Thanks.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.162
Okay. Dana. No breakfast?

08:58.162 --> 08:59.497
I had a protein bar.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.207
That's not breakfast. I made eggs.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.625
Eggs are cruel, mom.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.085
I watched this video, and these chickens

09:04.210 --> 09:05.586
- were just, like...
- Hey, everyone.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.004
- Dad's home.
- Hey, Dad.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.589
- Hi, welcome home, honey.
- Hi.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.049
Uh, I'm sorry I can't stay,

09:10.049 --> 09:11.384
I've got to bring the kids to school,

09:11.509 --> 09:12.468
and I have yoga.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.844
Okay, no problem,

09:13.844 --> 09:16.514
but before you go, I come bearing gifts.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.225
Jake, Cleveland Browns cap.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.686
- Huh, buddy?
- Awesome.

09:21.686 --> 09:22.687
Dana,

09:22.687 --> 09:24.146
this is a very special

09:24.146 --> 09:25.356
Cleveland snow globe.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.440
It's from the James Garfield

09:26.566 --> 09:27.984
monument gift shop.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.653
This is so great. Thank you, Dad.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.239
I don't have this one yet. It's awesome.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.575
He was assassinated,
never got to finish his term.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.785
And for my lovely wife...

09:39.662 --> 09:40.663
Another travel book.

09:40.663 --> 09:41.747
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.207
- You're welcome.
- There's a shopping list

09:43.207 --> 09:44.625
on the counter for the barbecue,

09:44.625 --> 09:46.043
and love you. Okay, bye.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.713
Come on, let's go. Everybody.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.800
Bye, Dad. Thanks again for the snow globe.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.719
Yeah, Dad. See you later.

10:08.899 --> 10:12.236
<i>It's so sweet of Dad
to bring us presents all the time, but</i>

10:12.236 --> 10:15.906
this has to be the most
boring object in the universe.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.200
Weren't you playing
with your snow globes last night?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.037
Yeah, but I'm into other stuff, too.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.039
Sometimes it's like
he doesn't even know me.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.165
Seriously.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.916
It's cool that he thinks of us.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.668
I don't even wear baseball caps.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.295
Yeah, 'cause you like to show off

10:29.295 --> 10:30.796
your cute little haircut we got you.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.590
All right, have fun at school.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.175
Learn all the... I love...

10:35.426 --> 10:36.761
I love you both.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.860
A hundred places we'll never see,

10:52.860 --> 10:54.362
a hundred things we'll never do.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.584
<i>♪ Beat on the brat, beat on the brat ♪</i>

11:08.584 --> 11:10.461
<i>♪ With a baseball bat, oh, yeah ♪</i>

11:12.338 --> 11:13.923
<i>♪ Oh, yeah, oh-oh ♪</i>

11:16.300 --> 11:19.512
<i>♪ Beat on the brat, beat on the brat. ♪</i>

11:33.401 --> 11:34.902
- That is insane.
- Mm.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.655
How do they do that with their legs?

11:37.655 --> 11:38.989
It's not that hard,

11:38.989 --> 11:41.575
you just have to breathe into it.

11:42.702 --> 11:43.619
Okay, is something wrong?

11:43.619 --> 11:46.288
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.248
Tell me.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.791
Do you promise not to say anything?

11:50.626 --> 11:52.420
On the way here,
I drove a hundred miles an hour.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.587
- What?
- Yeah.

11:53.587 --> 11:54.630
Maybe more. I don't know.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.756
- Are you insane?
- Yeah.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.049
I don't know, I think maybe I am.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.384
I think I was just trying to feel,

11:58.509 --> 11:59.593
like, a little bit of excitement

11:59.593 --> 12:00.803
because I look at my life,

12:00.803 --> 12:02.054
and it's the kids and class

12:02.054 --> 12:03.472
and a peck on the cheek from Harry,

12:03.472 --> 12:04.598
- so...
- Okay.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.183
This is about Harry.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.226
Mm, I don't know.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.687
I love Harry.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.356
He's an amazing husband,
he's a great father.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.692
But you're not satisfied?

12:16.110 --> 12:17.153
It wasn't always like this.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.696
In the beginning,

12:18.696 --> 12:20.072
- he was very exciting.
- Mm-hmm.

12:20.072 --> 12:24.118
He is still this amazing, sexy man,

12:24.118 --> 12:27.663
but sometimes he can be a little--

12:27.663 --> 12:29.874
I feel a little bad saying this--
he can be boring.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.253
He's a computer salesman
whose idea of fun and adventure

12:34.253 --> 12:36.130
is ordering coffee from Hawaii.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.758
Oh.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.844
I want to hold his hand,

12:41.844 --> 12:44.680
and I want to look into his eyes,

12:44.680 --> 12:47.850
and I want to feel...

12:47.850 --> 12:49.769
passion.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.522
All right, listen.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.107
You say he's gone a lot.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.567
Tell me this.

12:56.567 --> 12:59.195
Is he canceling plans a lot, last-minute?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.823
Take phone calls
and texts in the other room?

13:04.033 --> 13:06.494
When he does that,
it's mostly just for work stuff.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.789
Helen, I know you don't want to hear this,

13:09.789 --> 13:11.749
but you might not be

13:11.749 --> 13:13.459
the only one keeping a secret here.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.644
Hey, Tony.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.020
Good morning, Donna.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.980
Hey, how was the sales conference?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.190
Pretty good, pretty good.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.359
We might make
our June sales numbers after all.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.330
<i>Please identify.</i>

13:59.880 --> 14:03.342
<i>Access granted. Welcome to Omega Sector.</i>

14:03.342 --> 14:06.095
Trilby, you want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.180
What? You had a successful mission.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.266
- We're questioning Rand right now, and...
- What arms dealer

14:10.391 --> 14:11.892
gets every major rogue state
and terror group

14:12.017 --> 14:13.853
to come to him for an event like that?

14:15.896 --> 14:17.898
All right. Sit.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.108
And try to remember

14:19.108 --> 14:20.526
you're talking to your boss.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.570
Take a look at this.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.363
Iraq, last May.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.199
This is a military base
on the Turkish border.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.954
It was attacked using some kind of device.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.126
All the defenses, the concrete, the steel,

14:37.126 --> 14:39.503
crumbled in seconds.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.633
That event last night--

14:44.633 --> 14:47.344
everyone there was shopping
for one of their very own.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.429
Where'd it come from?

14:48.429 --> 14:49.430
We don't know.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.931
We hoped Rand would know,

14:50.931 --> 14:53.517
but it looks like
he's just a well-paid middleman.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.144
Are those things still out there?

14:55.144 --> 14:56.896
I wish I could say no, Harry,

14:56.896 --> 14:59.106
but there's one we can't account for yet.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.400
Stay ready.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.361
We'll get in touch
when we know our next move.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.405
You do that, and next time,

15:06.405 --> 15:09.033
tell me what I'm walking in to.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.540
Jake, where's the barbecue sauce?

15:16.540 --> 15:18.000
It's behind the cereal.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.335
What's it doing behind the cereal?

15:19.543 --> 15:21.295
I like it on my sandwiches.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.005
Buddy, you can't hoard barbecue sauce.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.131
I was looking for this.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.342
Okay, Dad, I don't get this.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.344
Why do we have to have a barbecue anyway?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.721
Well, because we're a family
and we're supporting your mother.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.556
And if you really
want to go to the beach tomorrow

15:32.681 --> 15:34.391
with Riley, you'll stop complaining.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.312
Don't forget to talk to Lawrence.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.314
My department chair?

15:40.314 --> 15:41.899
- Right, yes.
- Yes. We talked about this.

15:41.899 --> 15:42.858
- Okay.
- I got it.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.068
- You'll be fine.
- Lawrence, yup.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.611
I'm on it.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.239
You know, they say the more you flip it,

15:49.239 --> 15:51.075
it dries it out.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.159
- That what they say?
- Uh-huh.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.327
I'll keep that in mind.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.995
So you're the head
of the department, I hear?

15:54.995 --> 15:55.996
Yes.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.999
Oop, a little flare-up there.

15:58.999 --> 16:02.336
So, uh, Helen tells me
you work in computers?

16:02.336 --> 16:04.505
Yes. Sales to mid-sized
insurance companies.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.756
We specialize...

16:05.756 --> 16:08.384
Sometimes I wish
I was in something like sales.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.177
Get away from all the constant pressure.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.471
Harry. Look who's here.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.640
- Hey!
- Uh, hey!

16:14.640 --> 16:16.141
I guess I caught you in the middle of

16:16.266 --> 16:17.351
some kind of party or something?

16:17.476 --> 16:18.894
Yeah, just an event
for my work colleagues.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.354
Sorry to drop in on you.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.898
Just got a quick
office update for the big guy.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.483
There's cheese, Gib. Go have some cheese.

16:24.608 --> 16:25.526
- Mmm.
- I'm sorry.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.277
Uh, we'll just be a second.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.363
Uh, we'll get you
another refreshment, Lawrence.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.698
Don't mind if I do.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.074
All right.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.204
What are you doing here?

16:37.204 --> 16:38.580
You wouldn't answer the phone,

16:38.580 --> 16:39.790
so Trilby sent me over.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.250
Our worst fears have come true.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.961
That missing weapon
everybody was worried about?

16:43.961 --> 16:46.046
Well, it turns out
Rand sold one of those weapons

16:46.046 --> 16:47.131
before we picked him up.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.008
We head to Paris tomorrow to intercept it.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.592
Tomorrow?

16:50.592 --> 16:52.678
Mmm. Is that gouda?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.304
She has to send us?

16:54.304 --> 16:56.015
We're the only ones that are authorized.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.100
Plus, we are the best.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.185
Two missions in four days?

17:00.185 --> 17:02.521
Gib, I have a cover ID
I need to maintain here.

17:02.521 --> 17:06.483
Mm, technically,
it's just part two of one mission,

17:06.483 --> 17:08.569
and it's a good thing
your cover ID isn't barbecue master,

17:08.569 --> 17:10.320
'cause your grill game's weak, bro.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.114
- We all good here?
- Yes.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.824
Yes, yes. Just finishing up the update,

17:13.824 --> 17:15.117
uh, on the sales trip for tomorrow.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.411
Yeah.
There's a sales trip tomorrow?

17:17.411 --> 17:18.996
Sure is. Third-biggest

17:18.996 --> 17:20.539
insurance carrier in the region.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.957
The spread is awesome.

17:21.957 --> 17:22.916
Thank you.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.418
Can I talk to you for a second, Harry?

17:24.543 --> 17:25.461
Yeah, but the chicken...

17:25.461 --> 17:27.004
Leave the chicken.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.677
Another work trip? Really? Tomorrow?

17:33.677 --> 17:34.970
I know, honey. I am so sorry.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.221
It just came up last-minute.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.223
- Gib just told me...
- Yes, and Gib-- that's another thing.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.558
He's eating all of my hors d'oeuvres

17:39.683 --> 17:41.268
that I got for my work party.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.394
Harry, sometimes I don't think

17:42.394 --> 17:44.021
that you're focused
on your family anymore.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.481
What are you talking about?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.691
I'm making chicken
for your work barbecue as we speak.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.693
I'm not talking about chicken, Harry.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.737
I'm talking about us.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.324
What's wrong with us?

17:56.992 --> 17:58.327
I didn't want to have to say this,

17:58.327 --> 18:00.370
but Cherry showed me a checklist online.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.122
- Cherry?
- Mm-hmm.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.875
"Ten Signs Your Husband
is Having an Affair."

18:04.875 --> 18:06.043
- Oh...
- Late-night texts,

18:06.043 --> 18:07.920
secret phone calls, emotionally distant,

18:07.920 --> 18:10.047
and seven other things
that I don't remember,

18:10.047 --> 18:11.757
but the point is you've checked
every single one

18:11.882 --> 18:13.300
- of the boxes, Harry.
- Helen,

18:13.300 --> 18:15.469
an affair? How can you even think that?

18:15.469 --> 18:17.346
What other explanation could there be?

18:17.346 --> 18:18.889
Explanation? I'm working.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.474
I showed you the pictures from Cleveland.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.226
I don't need to see pictures
from Cleveland, Harry.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.769
I'm saying that our marriage is in crisis.

18:23.769 --> 18:24.978
Helen, I swear to you

18:24.978 --> 18:27.314
that it's not what you think.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.732
Well, what is it?

18:28.732 --> 18:30.317
I was planning something,

18:30.317 --> 18:31.944
and I wanted it to be a surprise.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.113
Oh, I wanted it to be a surprise.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.948
That's why Gib is here.
He was helping me plan.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.744
What, what's he helping you plan?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.998
We're going to Paris tomorrow.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.417
What? Yes.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.044
Oh, is that why
you got me the travel book?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.380
Yes.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.756
Surprise!

18:55.968 --> 18:57.594
Huh?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.558
- Dude, this is a joke, right?
- Shh...

19:02.558 --> 19:03.976
You invited your wife on a mission?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.519
No, I didn't invite her on a mission,

19:05.519 --> 19:07.104
I invited her on a vacation.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.897
Helen thought I was having an affair.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.315
I had to tell her something.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.568
So you say you got
a secret fantasy football league.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.861
You don't bring your wife...

19:13.861 --> 19:16.029
There's a reason
that they don't even let us

19:16.029 --> 19:17.990
date people without Omega clearance.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.450
They made an exception for you
because Harry's the best,

19:20.450 --> 19:22.953
- but you can't just...
- You think I wanted this?

19:22.953 --> 19:25.414
Helen said our marriage was in crisis.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.207
I thought I had this
whole husband thing handled,

19:27.207 --> 19:29.626
and all of a sudden
she thinks I don't love her anymore?

19:29.626 --> 19:31.461
So get a marriage counselor.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.922
Listen, we can have an agent in place

19:33.922 --> 19:36.049
tomorrow that can convince Helen
that this whole thing

19:36.049 --> 19:38.635
is in her head, she's going cra...

19:38.635 --> 19:40.679
Whatever. Just cancel the Paris thing...

19:40.679 --> 19:42.806
I can't. I already invited her.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.266
Fine. I'll talk to her, then.

19:44.474 --> 19:45.851
I told her you were helping me plan it.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.227
You...

19:47.227 --> 19:48.312
Plus, she's mad at you

19:48.312 --> 19:49.688
'cause you ate all of her cheese.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.690
This is the woman I love, Gib.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.317
She's coming. That's it.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.318
All right.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.986
But for the record,

19:55.986 --> 19:57.487
this is a bad idea.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.574
And also for the record,

20:00.574 --> 20:02.451
a lot of people were eating cheese.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.785
Okay?

20:22.763 --> 20:24.932
Wow, honey, that's so impressive.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.475
You sound so French.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.268
I teach languages, Harry.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.229
It's my thing.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.105
So, how does it feel to finally

20:32.105 --> 20:33.857
have a stamp in your passport?

20:33.857 --> 20:36.818
Uh, you know, it's fun. Something new.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.408
Welcome to the Grand Hotel Champs-Élysées.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.868
Help with your bags?

20:51.458 --> 20:53.126
Sorry, sorry.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.920
What language was that?

20:54.920 --> 20:57.005
Malagasy, from Madagascar.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.757
A former French colony.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.968
Malagasy. Now you're just showing off.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.844
Maybe just a little.

21:03.971 --> 21:04.972
<i>Harry!</i>

21:04.972 --> 21:06.723
This place is amazing.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.476
The bathtub
is the size of a swimming pool.

21:09.476 --> 21:10.769
This is really sweet.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.562
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:12.562 --> 21:15.399
I'll be right back,
I got to go pick up the opera tickets.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.359
You didn't tell me
we were going to the opera.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.903
I know. I'm full of surprises.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.989
Relax. Enjoy this.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.115
Take a bath.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.616
I'll be back to pick you up for dinner.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.451
- Okay. Love you.
- Love you.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.709
<i>What's our status?</i>

21:33.709 --> 21:35.502
Oh, our status is time is tight

21:35.502 --> 21:37.629
because you couldn't stay at the Ramada.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.423
Look, a courier's delivering the weapon

21:39.423 --> 21:41.258
to an office building downtown.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.093
But he has to meet the buyer alone, okay?

21:43.093 --> 21:44.094
That's our window.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.679
We get in, we take out the guy,

21:45.679 --> 21:48.181
we snatch the weapon. We have one hour.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.766
Let's make it in 45 minutes.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.601
I got to buy flowers on the way back.

21:51.601 --> 21:55.022
Wearing that to the op?

21:55.022 --> 21:56.732
What? What is wrong with what I'm wearing?

21:56.732 --> 21:58.692
Nothing. If you're happy...

21:58.692 --> 21:59.943
Well, you can't just say... Oh.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.195
Uh-huh.
You're trying to mess with my head.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.613
Trying? Looks like I'm succeeding.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.740
You're not gonna get in there.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.199
My head is fine and so are my clothes.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.868
- Thank you.
- We got to toughen you up, dude.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.135
Courier approaching. He has the weapon.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.481
Courier is entering the elevator now.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.941
<i>Copy that. In place.</i>

22:51.620 --> 22:53.538
<i>Securing courier
on the roof of the elevator.</i>

22:55.957 --> 22:58.794
<i>Tell the interrogation guys
they can pick him up any time.</i>

23:02.964 --> 23:04.674
Weapon secured, mission accomplished.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.676
<i>Nice work. Go get your flowers, Harry.</i>

23:06.802 --> 23:08.053
Yes, madam, no problem.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.013
At what time would you like to reserve?

23:10.013 --> 23:14.184
Um, okay,
so for tonight, we want 8:30, and then

23:14.184 --> 23:15.602
for tomorrow night...

23:17.646 --> 23:20.357
Uh, monsieur? Monsieur?
I can help you here.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.692
Thank you.

23:24.277 --> 23:27.697
Uh... I need a dinner reservation
for 6:00 p.m.,

23:27.697 --> 23:28.782
someplace romantic.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.325
And two tickets to the opera.

23:30.325 --> 23:31.326
Can you do that?

23:31.326 --> 23:32.452
Of course, of course.

23:32.452 --> 23:33.703
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

23:33.703 --> 23:36.123
Ah, I can recommend Bistro Adeline.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.750
- Yeah.
- Excellent, <i>très romantique.</i>

23:38.750 --> 23:40.794
And, uh, which opera?

23:40.794 --> 23:43.588
Oh, uh, I don't know. Any opera.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.174
Of course. Of course, monsieur...

23:46.174 --> 23:48.176
Tasker, Harry Tasker. Room 515.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.469
- Merci, Monsieur Tasker.
- Thank you.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.978
Thank you. Or merci. Oh.

23:57.978 --> 24:01.064
Cheers.

24:04.609 --> 24:08.280
Helen, I want to apologize.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.614
For everything.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.116
I've been a terrible husband.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.618
No. No, Harry, you haven't
been a terrible husband.

24:13.618 --> 24:16.163
I-I, you know,

24:16.163 --> 24:18.373
I just miss how...

24:18.373 --> 24:19.749
we used to be.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.544
You remember when we first met?

24:22.544 --> 24:24.254
Of course, every minute.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.631
Well, you remember
how we stayed up all night

24:26.631 --> 24:28.341
at that bar near Puerta del Sol?

24:28.341 --> 24:31.011
Puerta del Sol.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.179
Talking about

24:32.179 --> 24:34.890
dreams and adventures.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.516
It's just...

24:36.516 --> 24:38.518
where did that Harry Tasker go?

24:38.518 --> 24:41.480
He's still here,
I'm still the same Harry Tasker.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.523
I love Madrid,

24:43.523 --> 24:44.983
but I wanted to do something more stable

24:44.983 --> 24:46.151
for you and the kids.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.694
And you have to admit,

24:47.694 --> 24:49.779
Telonyx has been amazing to us.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.781
The 401(k), the medical flex account...

24:51.781 --> 24:54.159
I married you, Harry, I didn't marry

24:54.159 --> 24:58.330
America's number-three
supplier of computer systems

24:58.330 --> 24:59.581
to the insurance industry.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.334
- Ooh, number two.
- Oh...

25:02.334 --> 25:05.420
The number two. I'm just saying,

25:05.420 --> 25:07.172
maybe...

25:07.172 --> 25:10.592
there's more to life than just,

25:10.592 --> 25:12.427
you know, car payments

25:12.427 --> 25:13.803
and getting the kids to school on time

25:13.803 --> 25:15.847
and re-seeding our lawn, you know?

25:15.847 --> 25:18.058
Don't you ever

25:18.058 --> 25:20.602
want passion?

25:20.602 --> 25:23.522
Or just...

25:23.522 --> 25:24.856
adventure?

25:26.066 --> 25:27.692
Harry?

25:27.692 --> 25:28.818
Am I boring you?

25:28.818 --> 25:30.320
Helen, we need to get out of here now.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.446
Unbelievable.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.365
The second I talk about something
a little more serious

25:33.365 --> 25:35.242
than an electric bill,
you completely check out.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.368
- Helen!
- What?

25:36.493 --> 25:37.911
There are men here. They're coming for us.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.955
Oh, okay. Are they single?

25:39.955 --> 25:41.623
Can they talk about their emotions?

25:41.623 --> 25:42.666
Is this a joke?

25:42.666 --> 25:44.376
Honey, if that's a joke, it doesn't work.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.627
I have a lot of...

26:00.225 --> 26:01.768
Harry, what's going on?

26:18.285 --> 26:20.412
Oh, Harry, no, no, no, no!

26:28.378 --> 26:30.255
Harry, what is going on?

26:30.255 --> 26:32.132
Where did you learn to fight like that?

26:32.132 --> 26:34.301
Remember the tae kwon do class
I took with Dana?

26:34.301 --> 26:35.552
You learned all of that

26:35.552 --> 26:37.095
from getting a yellow belt
at a strip mall?

26:37.262 --> 26:38.638
How do you know how to shoot guns?

26:38.638 --> 26:40.348
I don't know,
I just pull the trigger thing.

26:40.348 --> 26:42.309
What about you--
when did you learn to fight like that?

26:42.434 --> 26:43.852
I learned everything
from an exercise video.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.437
Why are you punching in an exercise video?

26:45.437 --> 26:47.063
It relieves stress.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.150
(speaks French) Don't move.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.694
What do we do now?

26:54.321 --> 26:56.281
We move slowly.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.630
The distress signal
from Harry's watch is still live.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.424
I've pulled together the van,
the driver, but

27:14.424 --> 27:16.843
- trying to get a fix on his position is...
- Gib, what happened?

27:16.843 --> 27:19.095
You remember Harry's
little errand to get flowers?

27:19.095 --> 27:21.556
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, he got followed.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.516
Guy snuck into the hotel,

27:23.516 --> 27:25.435
disguised himself as a concierge,

27:25.435 --> 27:27.270
got Harry's plans,
got a whole team in place.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.605
Well, they captured them both,

27:28.605 --> 27:29.939
so they wanted them alive.

27:29.939 --> 27:31.524
Well, that's worse.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.527
I just-I just mean
that if they want Harry to talk,

27:34.527 --> 27:36.363
now they've got his wife,
and that's leverage.

27:36.363 --> 27:39.574
Can you guys please focus?
We got to save Harry and Helen.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.036
Bunch of street workers out back.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.956
It's kind of weird.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.833
They just fixed that street.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.838
All right, listen.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.840
I have to go
meet up with Riley in an hour.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.008
My boyfriend's gonna come over

27:57.175 --> 27:58.677
to help out with the beer
and then I'm gonna go...

27:58.677 --> 27:59.636
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.638
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
And beer?

28:01.638 --> 28:02.806
Where do you have beer?

28:02.806 --> 28:03.973
Behind my snow globes.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.725
All right? At least the stupid things

28:05.725 --> 28:07.602
are good for something.

28:11.981 --> 28:12.899
Hey, Mrs. Myers.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.360
Hi. I'm just checking in,

28:15.360 --> 28:16.903
thought I'd fix you two some dinner.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.571
No, we...

28:18.571 --> 28:20.573
we were gonna order pizza,
so we're-we're good.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.950
Don't be silly.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.077
Your father wanted you
to have a home-cooked meal.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.286
I brought lasagna.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.793
Helen, please, don't say anything.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.253
Harry, I know that you're scared,

28:33.253 --> 28:34.838
but I've read about this, okay?

28:34.838 --> 28:36.297
We have to engage with them.

28:36.297 --> 28:37.465
We have to humanize ourselves,

28:37.465 --> 28:38.842
- What?
- so I'll give a name,

28:38.842 --> 28:40.218
find a common interest. It's very...

28:40.218 --> 28:41.761
Excuse me, sir.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.471
There's been a mistake.

28:43.471 --> 28:46.474
My husband Harry is a computer salesman,

28:46.474 --> 28:47.934
and my name is Helen

28:47.934 --> 28:49.728
and I teach at a junior college.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.688
- What are you doing?
- Funny thing about me-- I love...

28:51.813 --> 28:53.022
- Honey, let me handle it.
- Harry...

28:53.022 --> 28:54.566
Harry, you're very good with computers,

28:54.566 --> 28:56.401
and, apparently, tae kwon do...

28:56.401 --> 28:58.486
Helen. Helen, I'm in sales.

28:58.486 --> 29:00.196
Negotiating is what I do.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.906
Honey, okay, but...

29:01.906 --> 29:03.700
Monsieur Tasker.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.076
You know him?

29:06.244 --> 29:09.330
Yeah, he's the hotel concierge.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.040
Too bad you won't make the opera.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.250
They were excellent seats.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.543
What do you want?

29:13.543 --> 29:15.003
You know exactly what I want.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.046
And your friends at Omega Sector

29:17.046 --> 29:18.381
are going to give it to me.

29:18.381 --> 29:19.799
What are you talking about?

29:19.799 --> 29:22.427
No! Harry...

29:26.890 --> 29:27.974
Where's the weapon?

29:27.974 --> 29:29.601
What weapon? This is crazy.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.977
I don't know who you think we are,

29:31.102 --> 29:32.645
but I've never heard of Omega Sector.

29:32.645 --> 29:34.939
Harry sells computers.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.357
He's not even a manager.

29:36.357 --> 29:39.068
He makes $63,000 a year,

29:39.068 --> 29:41.613
he drives a 2004 Subaru

29:41.613 --> 29:43.072
when we're not switching out the vans.

29:43.072 --> 29:45.325
He is the fourth-best player

29:45.325 --> 29:46.534
in his bowling league.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.161
Shut up.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.662
Kill the woman. She's useless to me.

29:49.662 --> 29:51.539
Wait! Wait, wait.

29:51.539 --> 29:52.999
Yes, you're right, you're right.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.626
I'm an operative for Omega Sector

29:54.626 --> 29:56.044
and she's my supervisor.

29:57.420 --> 29:58.421
You're saying...

29:59.547 --> 30:01.007
...she is a spy?

30:01.007 --> 30:02.967
Oh, of course she is.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.844
What idiot brings a useless

30:04.844 --> 30:07.222
junior college teacher on a mission?

30:10.892 --> 30:12.852
Right? I mean, come on.

30:12.852 --> 30:16.189
I think... I think you're lying to me,

30:16.189 --> 30:19.567
and maybe you'll change your story

30:19.567 --> 30:21.569
if-if I take an eye,

30:21.569 --> 30:23.446
if I cut it out.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.575
I want the truth. Now.

30:27.575 --> 30:30.787
Uh, it's true, what he's saying.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.872
I am...

30:32.872 --> 30:35.583
an Omega supervisor.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.710
And if you cut out my employee's eye,

30:37.710 --> 30:39.379
there's gonna be hell to pay, buddy.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.381
You, a supervisor?

30:41.381 --> 30:42.674
I'm sorry that I'm a woman

30:42.674 --> 30:43.883
and that surprises you.

30:43.883 --> 30:45.260
What year is it?

30:45.260 --> 30:46.594
How do you think she helped me

30:46.594 --> 30:47.804
fight off your team

30:47.804 --> 30:49.556
- in the bistro?
- Uh-huh.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.808
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- She's trained.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.394
And currently, I supervise...

30:54.394 --> 30:56.062
all the others.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.233
We've got to move. Take them both.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.818
We'll sort this out at the base.

31:01.818 --> 31:03.778
Get the helicopter ready.

31:07.365 --> 31:08.616
Harry, I think it's time you tell

31:08.616 --> 31:10.118
this useless junior college teacher

31:10.118 --> 31:11.119
what the hell is going on.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.912
These people obviously have us

31:12.912 --> 31:14.080
mixed up with someone else,

31:14.080 --> 31:15.373
and you're playing along with them?

31:16.916 --> 31:18.376
Are you trying to get us killed?

31:19.669 --> 31:20.753
Please don't be mad.

31:20.753 --> 31:22.088
Well, it's too late, Harry.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.299
- I'm mad.
- I'm a spy.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.801
I work for an organization
called Omega Sector.

31:26.801 --> 31:27.886
That is insane. You were just

31:27.886 --> 31:29.512
in a sales conference in Cleveland.

31:29.512 --> 31:30.722
Helen, I was in the Caribbean,

31:30.722 --> 31:32.307
capturing a black market arms dealer.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.850
We intercepted a weapon earlier today.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.644
Toda... You...
When you were getting opera tickets?

31:36.644 --> 31:37.687
Eh...

31:37.687 --> 31:39.606
So...

31:41.024 --> 31:42.233
You don't...

31:42.233 --> 31:44.110
you don't sell computers?

31:44.110 --> 31:46.446
No, I do.
That's true. I do sell computers.

31:46.446 --> 31:50.033
But, uh, Telonyx
is a front for a spy organization.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.245
For how long is...

31:55.872 --> 31:57.081
I got recruited in '98.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.666
In 1998?

31:58.666 --> 32:01.085
Harry, you looked me in the eye.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.670
You told me you weren't lying.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.213
- I wasn't lying.
- Yes, you were.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.257
No, I wasn't. I did not have an affair.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.342
I didn't have an affair.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.718
But you've just been lying about

32:08.718 --> 32:10.261
everything since we met?

32:10.261 --> 32:12.722
Harry, you put the children in danger.

32:12.722 --> 32:13.806
No, the kids are fine.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.266
Omega Sector kept them safe.

32:15.266 --> 32:16.517
Mrs. Myers, from next door--

32:16.517 --> 32:18.770
she's a trained
countersurveillance officer.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.105
The cat lady from next door?

32:21.105 --> 32:22.982
She's a trained assassin.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.032
Mm.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.784
This is Socks Two.

32:34.911 --> 32:36.829
His mommy was Socks One.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.248
I'm not sure who his daddy was.

32:39.248 --> 32:41.459
- It's complicated.
- Mm.

32:41.459 --> 32:45.505
This... this is Domino.

32:45.505 --> 32:48.716
Because her spots look like dominos.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.843
Well, as much as I would love to see more,

32:50.843 --> 32:52.220
I have homework that I have to do.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.263
But I bet that Jake would love to see

32:54.263 --> 32:55.556
more pics of the cats in sweaters.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.141
Actually, I should, um,

32:57.141 --> 32:58.685
probably hit the books, too.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.687
So, um, maybe a little later?

33:00.687 --> 33:02.855
Any time, dear.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.065
Thanks for dinner.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.692
Enjoy your studying.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.152
All right.

33:18.037 --> 33:20.415
Security team, this is team leader.

33:20.415 --> 33:23.167
<i>Fox cub one, fox cub two secure.</i>

33:23.167 --> 33:24.752
Copy, team leader.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.720
Looks like they're in there.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.560
What do we got?

33:40.560 --> 33:41.811
Two guards posted outside.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.396
Sounds like there's a chopper out back.

33:43.396 --> 33:45.023
Probably preparing to move them.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.607
- This is for you.
- Hey.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.276
Oh, I'll be in the van.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.278
Gib, Harry's in trouble.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.155
Let's go.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.160
Harry, if we live through this,

33:57.160 --> 33:58.745
you're sleeping on the couch.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.204
Yeah, yeah, I figured.

34:03.458 --> 34:04.834
The guy on the left-- there's something

34:04.834 --> 34:06.502
- wrong with his knee.
- How do you know?

34:06.502 --> 34:08.129
Because they're from northern Spain,

34:08.129 --> 34:11.132
and your useless wife speaks Basque.

34:28.441 --> 34:29.859
Nice job.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.402
Is that from your exercise video?

34:31.402 --> 34:33.821
That's from yoga class. What's next?

34:34.781 --> 34:36.032
Come here.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.408
Okay.

34:37.408 --> 34:39.494
Our best bet is to steal that helicopter.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.662
You can fly a helicopter?

34:41.662 --> 34:44.040
Harry, what about that time
when we were in Maui

34:44.040 --> 34:45.583
and I wanted to go on the volcano tour

34:45.583 --> 34:47.126
and you said it made you airsick?

34:47.126 --> 34:49.045
Uh, honey, please, can this wait?

34:49.045 --> 34:51.172
Fine. But this can't.

34:55.384 --> 34:59.055
Okay. Okay.

35:05.144 --> 35:07.647
Ah, so I get to ruin my favorite dress
to tie up a terrorist.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.982
I'll have Omega
get you a new one, all right?

35:09.982 --> 35:11.359
Just make sure he's secure.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.113
All right, take this.
We got to shoot our way

35:15.113 --> 35:16.280
- to the helicopter.
- What? No.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.116
It'll be fine. I'll talk you through it.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.450
Harry, that's the worst idea ever.

35:19.575 --> 35:20.868
- There's, like, eight guys out there.
- Helen,

35:20.868 --> 35:21.953
we have one chance.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.246
I'm trying to save our lives.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.581
You're not doing a very good job, Harry.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.626
Just take the guard's uniform

35:28.626 --> 35:30.044
and walk me outside.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.254
They're expecting two prisoners.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.630
So get on the radio and tell them

35:32.630 --> 35:33.881
that you're bringing me out first.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.258
I don't know how to speak Basque.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.844
It'll be fine. I'll talk you through it.

35:53.192 --> 35:55.444
So explain to me
where you were when you were

35:55.444 --> 35:56.904
- fly fishing last month?
- Helen, please.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.996
- Can we do this later?
- I just wanted to know

36:04.996 --> 36:06.747
where you were
when you missed our anniversary.

36:06.747 --> 36:08.291
I was in Argentina, saving the president.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.542
Hmm, of course you were.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.087
Now.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.307
Hey!

36:29.270 --> 36:31.355
We have to take off. Hold on.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.444
Aah!

36:45.203 --> 36:46.787
Harry!

36:49.749 --> 36:51.626
Helen, I can't control it!
You got to get him off.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.002
I'm trying!

37:01.969 --> 37:04.263
- Helen!
- Harry, get us down!

37:04.263 --> 37:06.182
I can't land.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.935
- There's too much gunfire.
- Harry!

37:08.935 --> 37:10.519
<i>Autopilot engaged.</i>

37:12.939 --> 37:14.357
Give me your hand!

37:17.443 --> 37:19.654
Come on, baby. Give me your hand.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.590
You okay?

37:43.219 --> 37:45.137
That's one way to see Paris.

37:56.232 --> 37:57.650
How was the sales trip?

37:57.650 --> 37:59.068
Oh, you know me. Killed it.

37:59.068 --> 38:01.153
Helen's helping me hang up my sales award.

38:02.154 --> 38:03.114
Harry, I don't understand

38:03.114 --> 38:04.490
why we can't just go home already.

38:04.490 --> 38:06.325
I know it's a pain,
but we have to get debriefed.

38:07.493 --> 38:08.411
Debriefed, yes.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.204
Oh, yes. Of course.

38:10.204 --> 38:11.372
Good morning.

38:12.665 --> 38:15.084
All of the people who work here

38:15.084 --> 38:16.460
are part of this...

38:16.460 --> 38:19.088
No, no. Some... Most sell computers.

38:19.088 --> 38:21.590
Just... some of us have a side job.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.761
Helen, I know this is a lot to absorb,

38:25.761 --> 38:27.388
but I just want to tell you,

38:27.388 --> 38:29.765
you were amazing in Paris.

38:29.765 --> 38:32.018
- You saved our lives.
- Oh.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.686
And with this coming out, finally,

38:33.686 --> 38:35.646
this could be really good for us.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.023
I've wanted to be honest with you

38:37.023 --> 38:38.983
for so many years.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.610
Yes, but you weren't, Harry.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.279
Uh, get-get right in the middle.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.780
What?

38:45.197 --> 38:46.991
I've been married to somebody
that I don't know.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.909
I spent 17 years of my life

38:49.035 --> 38:50.953
married to someone who said
that skiing was too dangerous

38:51.203 --> 38:53.789
and that foreign foods
gave him an upset stomach.

38:53.789 --> 38:55.499
Well, technically, some foreign foods do

38:55.499 --> 38:57.835
upset my stomach.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.799
Well...

39:03.799 --> 39:05.593
this was a disaster.

39:05.593 --> 39:07.803
Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't ideal.

39:07.803 --> 39:10.973
But the mission was technically a success.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.059
We'll discuss the mission later.
Right now,

39:13.059 --> 39:15.061
we have a lot to do.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.438
Why did she say "we"

39:17.438 --> 39:18.814
and then look at me?

39:18.814 --> 39:20.941
I don't think there's a "we,"

39:20.941 --> 39:22.318
uh, 'cause I'm not part of this.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.986
That's not how it works.

39:23.986 --> 39:25.404
Once you know about Omega,

39:25.404 --> 39:27.573
once you've been
a part of an operation like this,

39:27.573 --> 39:29.742
you're a target.

39:29.742 --> 39:32.119
And you're a part of it,
whether any of us like it or not,

39:32.119 --> 39:34.997
for your safety and ours.

39:34.997 --> 39:37.208
Yes, uh, but I'm a teacher.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.126
I'm not a spy.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.878
You'll still be a teacher.

39:40.878 --> 39:44.256
We got you a tenured position at Shoreton.

39:48.260 --> 39:51.389
That is quite interesting. Tenure?

39:51.389 --> 39:54.016
At Shoreton? Is she serious?
Are you serious?

39:54.016 --> 39:55.684
Yes.

39:55.684 --> 39:58.479
You'll need something with a more flexible

39:58.479 --> 40:00.231
teaching schedule during your training.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.359
It's exciting, right--

40:03.359 --> 40:05.111
- going back to a university?
- Hang on a sec, Harry.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.071
My training-- what's my training?

40:07.071 --> 40:08.823
The basics.

40:08.823 --> 40:11.367
Countersurveillance, weapons,

40:11.367 --> 40:13.327
self-defense, evasive driving,

40:13.327 --> 40:15.871
threat detection, data security.

40:17.164 --> 40:20.167
Harry, did you know
this was going to happen?

40:21.377 --> 40:22.670
I guess that's a yes, then.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.880
Honey, it's for your protection,

40:24.880 --> 40:27.550
and our family's.

40:27.550 --> 40:30.386
Looks like the two of you
have plenty to talk about.

40:30.386 --> 40:33.013
Welcome aboard, Helen.

40:47.069 --> 40:49.238
Okay.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.282
Here we are.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.908
Home sweet home.

40:54.243 --> 40:55.494
Uh, guys,

40:55.494 --> 40:57.580
I don't want to overstep, but

40:57.580 --> 40:59.790
I'm picking up some tension.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.876
So, security-wise, it may be best

41:01.876 --> 41:03.961
if you guys acted, uh, normal.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.046
All right? All right.

41:10.217 --> 41:13.345
Jake, doesn't this seem a little weird?

41:13.345 --> 41:15.598
What's so weird? They're home.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.933
Okay, tell me this:

41:17.933 --> 41:20.352
do they look like they
just got back from vacation?

41:20.352 --> 41:22.730
No, not really.

41:22.730 --> 41:25.107
I wonder what's going on.

41:25.107 --> 41:28.110
And how, exactly,
are we supposed to act normal

41:28.110 --> 41:29.862
after we were kidnapped,

41:29.862 --> 41:31.822
almost died in a helicopter crash

41:31.822 --> 41:34.325
and your spy plane
lost the rest of my luggage?

41:34.325 --> 41:35.784
Look, I know it's a lot,

41:35.784 --> 41:37.703
but please, just do it for the kids.

41:37.703 --> 41:38.871
They need you.

41:39.872 --> 41:41.290
I need you.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.294
We're a team, right?

41:52.259 --> 41:53.594
Hey!

41:53.594 --> 41:54.678
- Hey, we're home!
- Hey!

41:57.473 --> 41:59.141
We did.

41:59.141 --> 42:01.936
- Yes, you wouldn't believe it.
- Oh, come here.
