[Jughead] After Mr. Cooper
told Mrs. Cooper that Betty

00:04.587 --> 00:07.382
had been dancing
in her window,
in her skivvies,

00:07.382 --> 00:10.760
for Archie's...
uh, benefit,

00:10.760 --> 00:14.264
Mrs. Cooper phoned
Hollywood, California

00:14.264 --> 00:18.893
to give Hermione Lodge
a little good old fashioned
East Coast what-for,

00:18.893 --> 00:21.563
since Veronica had supplied
the skivvies in question.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.067
Then, Alice rang
her good friend
Penelope Blossom

00:26.067 --> 00:28.111
for advice about what to do,

00:28.111 --> 00:29.571
mother-to-mother.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.323
Well, I can't say
I'm surprised.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.701
By what, Mother?

00:37.287 --> 00:41.082
Operator, can you put me
through to Stratford-747?

00:41.082 --> 00:44.836

saving her little hussy
of a daughter.

you won't believe...

00:49.549 --> 00:52.594
[Jughead] So by morning,
everyone knew some version
of what had happened,

00:52.594 --> 00:57.432
most of it untrue,
and repercussions
were being felt far and near.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.142
She's never gonna talk
to me again, is she?

00:59.142 --> 01:00.685
Your mother just
needs to understand

01:00.685 --> 01:02.812
that you're a red-blooded,
American young man

01:02.812 --> 01:06.608
and that Betty, well,
she's a voluptuous,
ripe peach of a girl.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.193
[sighs]

01:08.193 --> 01:10.779
I just...
I'm so embarrassed,
Uncle Frank.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.572
Well...

01:12.572 --> 01:14.783
Were you caught
with your pants down?

01:14.783 --> 01:16.201
- Yes.
- [sighs]

01:16.201 --> 01:17.368
Was what you were doing
a little raunchy?

01:18.369 --> 01:19.913
Well, maybe.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.748
But I'd be more worried
about you

01:21.748 --> 01:23.708
if you weren't
showing an interest
in that kitten.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.668
But for now,
just keep up
with your schoolwork,

01:25.668 --> 01:27.170

01:27.170 --> 01:29.005

01:29.005 --> 01:30.757
- take plenty of cold showers.
- [chuckles]

01:30.757 --> 01:33.093
We'll get you
through this,
Archie. All right?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.052
Yeah.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.179
Good.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.562
[Alice] You cannot
parade around naked
in front of boys.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.272
Okay, again,

01:46.272 --> 01:50.110
Archie and I were not naked.
We were just...

01:50.110 --> 01:53.196
Having fun.
We were in
separate houses, Mom.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.823
What did you think
was going to happen?

01:54.823 --> 01:57.408
With you,
anything's possible.

01:57.408 --> 02:01.746
Which is why, starting today,
you will be cutting a rug
on Riverdale Grandstand.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.290
Mom, no.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.459
Mom, I don't wanna be
part of Dad's dance show.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.963
Only nerds and squares
are on Dad's dance show.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.423
All right, enough of the sass,
young lady!

02:12.423 --> 02:16.052
You will be dancing
from 3:00 to 6:00
every afternoon after school.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.388
We will make sure that
you're nice and tuckered out

02:18.388 --> 02:22.142
so there's no more
late-night shows with
your pinkie out of jail

02:22.142 --> 02:24.477
for over-sexed young men
like Archie.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.856
And if I catch wind of you
even saying "hello" to that
red-headed pervert,

02:27.856 --> 02:28.982
well...

No. Actually, I'm quite proud

12:10.187 --> 12:12.481
I was wondering
if I could trade
this check in for cash.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.817
I don't trust banks.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.485
[Bernie] Sure, Mr. Rayberry.

12:17.903 --> 12:18.863
Let me talk to payroll.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.032
Thank you.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.826
- Again, I'm so sorry--
- It's 12:30.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.912
Shouldn't you be in school?

12:26.912 --> 12:27.955
I might have dropped out.

12:28.664 --> 12:29.540
Why?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.625
Well...

12:31.625 --> 12:34.044
The finks at the top
said that if I don't stop
writing comic books

12:34.044 --> 12:36.255
and corrupting America's youth,

12:36.255 --> 12:39.383
that I'll be expelled
for some cooked-up malarkey.

12:39.383 --> 12:40.885
So... I beat feet.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.636
Huh.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.388
Hope it's worth it.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.351
What time is your
lunch break, anyway?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.856
Any time, I guess.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.322
Hey, Kev.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.990
You know, you and I
have been in the same
grade since kindergarten.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.370
Why basketball? Why now?

13:08.370 --> 13:10.122
Uh, it was my dad's idea.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.627
I just think he wants me
to be a regular guy.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.003
Less of an off-horse.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.379
What does that even mean?

13:18.964 --> 13:20.841
You know, a guy
who likes sports,

13:20.841 --> 13:22.551
who, um...

13:22.551 --> 13:26.514
does, like, what
you did with Betty.

13:26.514 --> 13:30.267
Who isn't interested
in things like poetry

13:30.267 --> 13:34.104
and drama and music
and movie stars and--

13:34.104 --> 13:35.231
I like those things.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.149
Well, yeah, but you're...

13:39.318 --> 13:40.194
[chuckles]

13:40.194 --> 13:41.111
What?

13:42.655 --> 13:43.989
What am I?

13:43.989 --> 13:44.865
You're normal, Archie.
You're normal.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.993
Kevin, so are you.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.247
Yeah, I...
I wanna be,

13:51.247 --> 13:52.164
more than anything.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.334
I just want to be
like everybody else.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.420
[door opens]

13:59.213 --> 14:00.089
[grunts]

14:03.759 --> 14:05.094
[players chattering
indistinctly in distance]

14:07.388 --> 14:08.639
[people chattering
indistinctly]

14:10.140 --> 14:11.892
Again and...
and for the rest
of my life,

14:11.892 --> 14:13.435
I would like
to apologize...

14:13.435 --> 14:15.646
For stealing and
reading my novel.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.732
- For that. Yeah.
- [Brad] Mmm-hmm.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.276
It was a chump move

14:20.276 --> 14:21.861
and you had every right
to bite my head off.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.862
I did.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.489
That said, I, um...

14:27.074 --> 14:29.994
I may have, uh, overreacted.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.287
[Jughead] No, I... I...

14:31.287 --> 14:32.621
I totally understand

14:32.621 --> 14:34.164
why you were
being protective over

14:34.164 --> 14:35.708
The Jupiter Journals.
Mr. Rayberry, I...

14:37.710 --> 14:39.628
I think it's
a masterpiece.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.672
- Huh.
- [chuckles]

14:41.672 --> 14:42.965
If I wrote that manuscript,

14:42.965 --> 14:44.550
I... I think I could
die a happy man.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.218
Wow.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.636
Before we start

14:47.636 --> 14:49.054
planning your funeral,
let's talk about

14:49.054 --> 14:50.222
you dropping
out of school.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.516
You should go back.

14:52.516 --> 14:53.767
Education's important.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.854
I... I just
don't really

14:56.854 --> 14:59.356
see why I have
to choose between
writing comic books

14:59.356 --> 15:00.482
and getting an education.

15:00.482 --> 15:01.400
You shouldn't.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.736
And this,

15:03.736 --> 15:06.864
young sir, is what is
known as a [sniffs]

15:06.864 --> 15:08.032
Gordian knot.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.536
So, tell me everything
you know

15:12.536 --> 15:13.746
about this
Werthers clown,

15:13.746 --> 15:15.039
who he is,

15:15.039 --> 15:16.373
where he comes from,
what he's about,

15:16.373 --> 15:17.291
what he believes.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.252
[players whistling
and cheering]

15:20.252 --> 15:22.212
- [Julian] Fellas,
an announcement.
- [clapping and whooping]

15:22.212 --> 15:24.965
Let's give a proud woof
for Rodgers here

15:24.965 --> 15:26.467
who finally did

15:26.467 --> 15:29.595
the dirty deed with
Jenny Stevens last night.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.556
In the back of his dad's
Thunderbird, no less.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.350
- [clapping and whistling]
- [player 1] Whoo!

15:34.350 --> 15:36.894
- [player 2] Whoo! Whoo!
- Between Rodgers
and Andrews'

15:36.894 --> 15:38.354
X-rated peep show
with Betty Cooper,

15:38.354 --> 15:40.272
we might want
to rename our team

15:40.272 --> 15:41.815
[inhales] the Horndogs.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.275
[players grunting]

15:43.275 --> 15:44.568
The question is,

15:44.568 --> 15:46.362
which one of you
fruitcakes is next?

15:47.863 --> 15:49.281
Can't be a real man

15:49.281 --> 15:50.658
unless you've gone
all the way with a woman.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.242
We all know
Fogarty's solid.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.786
You and Midge, right?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.454
That's none of your
beeswax there, Blossom.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.415
Man of mystery, okay.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.251
What about you, Keller?

16:02.628 --> 16:03.504
What about you?

16:04.254 --> 16:06.298
Julian?

16:06.298 --> 16:07.549
Pretty sure
you're still a virgin?

16:07.549 --> 16:09.718
Uh, keep dreaming.

16:09.718 --> 16:10.761
Crossed into
the promised land

16:10.761 --> 16:13.013
on my 16th birthday,

16:13.013 --> 16:15.432
when my dad took me
to see Twyla Twyst.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.642
Who's Twyla Twyst?

16:16.642 --> 16:18.686
A floozy who works

16:18.686 --> 16:20.771
out of the Cozy Time Motel
behind the school.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.690
- [player whoops]
- Spend one night with her.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.149
[exhales] Heck, even one hour

16:24.149 --> 16:25.359
and you'll never
be the same.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.488
What do you say, Keller?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.116
You up for it?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.325
Put a lid on it. Julian.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.577
- Kevin--
- Yeah, I'll do it.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.495
I'll go see her.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.580
Attaboy, Keller.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.041
That's the spirit.

16:41.041 --> 16:41.917
Let me know
when and where.

16:46.714 --> 16:50.217
So, Clay,
bring me up to speed.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.886
Am I sensing you're
a fellow cinephile?

16:52.886 --> 16:54.930
It's actually what
I wannna study in college.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.266
Filmmaking.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.102
I know, it sounds nutty
as a can of peanuts,

17:00.102 --> 17:01.729
but I dream
of one day

17:01.729 --> 17:03.856
inspiring people like
my hero inspired me.

17:04.648 --> 17:05.899
Oscar Micheaux.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.609
- Who's he?
- [Clay] A Black director.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.902
He started at
the same time as

17:08.902 --> 17:10.029
D.W. Griffith
and Mary Pickford.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.905
Well, if we're,

17:11.905 --> 17:15.117
indulging in pipe dreams today.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.036
I've never been crazy
about being in front

17:17.036 --> 17:19.496
of the cameras
but I do love

17:19.496 --> 17:20.414
being near them.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.792
Well, maybe

17:23.792 --> 17:27.337
your destiny is to run
a studio one day and then,

17:27.337 --> 17:29.715
- you can hire me
to direct my first movie.
- [laughs]

17:30.799 --> 17:31.675
Deal.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.511
[door opens]

17:35.179 --> 17:36.889
Oh, Mr. Lemly.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.223
When does our rush begin?

17:40.225 --> 17:41.643
You're looking at it.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.937
Seems like it's gonna be
another slow night.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.981
Uh, slow is one thing

17:45.981 --> 17:48.358
but graveyard-like
is another.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.194
What gives?

17:50.194 --> 17:52.279
TV's taken
a Dracula-sized bite

17:52.279 --> 17:53.530
out of our business.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.657
Also, that new [sighs]

17:55.657 --> 17:58.035
drive-in that's just
opened up, The Starlight,

17:59.369 --> 18:00.287
doesn't help either.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.830
Excuse me.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.041
Living rooms
and drive-ins

18:04.041 --> 18:05.793
cannot compete with
the experience

18:05.793 --> 18:07.377
of seeing a movie

18:07.377 --> 18:10.255
in a palace like
the Babylonium.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.341
People need to be
reminded of that.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.134
How about an ad
in the Riverdale Register?

18:15.469 --> 18:18.138
Or what about a commercial?

18:18.806 --> 18:20.182
On television

18:20.182 --> 18:22.810
aired during
Riverdale Grandstand.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.019
All the kids will
see it that way.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.818
Dancing up a storm
sure is hard work.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.236
That's why
I like to fortify myself

18:32.236 --> 18:33.737
throughout the day
with hearty helpings

18:33.737 --> 18:35.114
of Blossom Maple Syrup.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.573
Try it on your pancakes.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.075
- [Julian] Waffles.
- [Penelope] Biscuits.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.202
[Cheryl] And even your
favorite ice cream.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.537
Nine out of 10 Americans agree

18:41.537 --> 18:43.122
there is nothing quite like

18:43.122 --> 18:44.915
the extra sweet flavor
of Blossom maple syrup.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.208
And remember, kids,

18:46.208 --> 18:47.501
it's not just for
breakfast anymore.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.419
Now in economy-sized tins.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.381
[director] And cut!

18:52.381 --> 18:54.174
["Listen To Me Baby" playing]

18:54.174 --> 18:58.387
All right, kids,
let's swing again
to, "Listen To Me Baby."

19:06.979 --> 19:07.855
Hey, there.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.316
It's Betty, right?

19:11.316 --> 19:15.237
I'm Troy. My, uh,
usual partner, Judy,
has the mumps.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.364
You wanna let me
take you out for a spin?

19:17.364 --> 19:19.324
Sure, you might as well.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.242
Well, that's swell.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.624
[slow music playing]

19:35.007 --> 19:35.883
So, is it true?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.179
That you, uh,

19:40.179 --> 19:42.514
like it when guys watch you?

19:44.516 --> 19:46.518
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.979
[chuckles]
Come on, fess up.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.522
I mean, we've all
heard the story.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.692
After we wrap here,

19:53.692 --> 19:56.486
how about you and I
go down to the river

19:56.486 --> 19:58.071
and you can
put on a little

19:58.071 --> 19:59.448
private show for me?

19:59.990 --> 20:00.866
Will ya?

20:02.075 --> 20:04.077
Get your paws
off me, creep!

20:05.329 --> 20:07.080
[gasps]

20:07.080 --> 20:08.957
[Alice] Betty! Betty!

20:08.957 --> 20:12.044
[gasps] You cannot do that
on live television.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.670
[chuckles softly]
Atta girl.

20:18.842 --> 20:19.885
For the 100th time,

20:19.885 --> 20:21.261
it wasn't my fault.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.471
Troy got fresh with me.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.431
- He grabbed my--
- If he did,

20:24.431 --> 20:27.267
it's because you have
created a fast reputation.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.978
I barely touched him.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.897
What is the matter with you?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.607
You know what would
solve this problem?

20:33.607 --> 20:35.776
If you let me off
Riverdale Grandstand.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.653
You know what?
I'm gonna have a little chat

20:37.653 --> 20:39.738
with all of
the young men
on our show.

20:39.738 --> 20:43.033
And no one is going
to dance with you.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.785
Wait, so what am I
going to be doing then?

20:44.785 --> 20:46.161
You can sit in the corner

20:46.161 --> 20:48.080
and stew like a sourpuss
for all I care.

20:50.832 --> 20:51.708
[knocking on door]

20:53.543 --> 20:55.254
Hey, Mr. Rayberry.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.339
Uh, sorry, can...
Can I come in?

20:57.339 --> 20:58.590
Sure.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.842
As long you don't
swipe anything.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.052
I've... I've...
I've been thinking about it.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.971
I don't wanna
give up writing.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.681
My high school diploma
be damned.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.182
[Brad] I agree.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.684
And you're right.
You shouldn't stop writing,

21:08.684 --> 21:10.269
but you do need a front.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.853
- A cover.
- A front?

21:11.853 --> 21:13.730
I have friends in
Hollywood who, uh,

21:13.730 --> 21:14.731
were blacklisted

21:14.731 --> 21:17.317
when McCarthy was, um,

21:17.317 --> 21:18.986
ringing the alarm
on the so-called

21:18.986 --> 21:20.195
"Communist threat."

21:20.779 --> 21:22.114
And, uh,

21:22.114 --> 21:23.490
they kept writing
but under pseudonyms.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.742
You should do that.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.286
Hmm?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.912

21:34.293 --> 21:35.752
that I just quit writing
comic books altogether?

And I just most
recently started

23:26.988 --> 23:28.281
How, uh,

23:28.281 --> 23:30.909
magnanimous of you.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.453
Jughead agrees to stop
writing horror comics

23:33.453 --> 23:34.830
per this agreement.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.581
But I will continue
to write comics

23:36.581 --> 23:39.751
for Pep, specifically,
Super Duck.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.462
It's wholesome,

Unobjectionable,
you might say.

What you are doing
to my mentee

23:56.393 --> 23:58.395

And if you continue
to harass him,

So how does
Jones v. Board of Education
sound to you?

24:19.624 --> 24:21.209
I'm curious
if the justices

24:21.209 --> 24:22.711
would take the same stance

24:22.711 --> 24:25.589
regarding comic books
as you do, Mr. Werthers.

24:25.589 --> 24:29.551
Namely that they are
as problematic as

Yes, for the moment.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.020
I feel for him,

33:42.020 --> 33:43.229
having a son who's bent.

33:44.605 --> 33:45.690
Such a shame.

33:49.861 --> 33:50.945
Well, what about
your breakfast?

33:50.945 --> 33:52.697
Uh, lost my appetite.

33:59.912 --> 34:00.872
Hmm.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.752
I've been mulling over

34:05.752 --> 34:08.129
our conversation
from yesterday,
Mr. Lemly.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.757
And I'd like to buy
the Babylonium.

34:12.925 --> 34:15.219
More specifically,

34:15.219 --> 34:18.598
I'd like to trade this painting
from my personal collection
for your theater.

34:19.432 --> 34:20.933
I've spoken to Crestby's

34:20.933 --> 34:23.311
and I think you'll find
that on the open market,

34:23.311 --> 34:25.855
an original Hopper
is worth much more

34:25.855 --> 34:27.648
than what my parents
are offering you.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.195
I'm deep in negotiations
with your folks.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.112
I know.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.864
But...

34:34.864 --> 34:38.993
our commercial
wasn't false advertising.

34:38.993 --> 34:43.748
Going to the movies
is special.

34:43.748 --> 34:47.085
Working here at the Babylonium,
even briefly, has rekindled

34:47.085 --> 34:48.669

[Clay] Plus,

34:51.130 --> 34:53.841
wouldn't you feel better
knowing that someone's

keeping the lights on
and the projector running?

34:56.594 --> 35:01.015

the same love and respect
you have all these years?

I don't know,
I think I messed up
with Kevin, Betty.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.858
I think I made things worse.

35:10.858 --> 35:13.069
No, Arch.

35:13.069 --> 35:15.613
You were just trying
to include him, make him
feel like a part of things.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.243
You protected him
as best as you could.

35:20.243 --> 35:24.372
Well, isn't this
a sight to behold?

35:24.372 --> 35:26.833
My mother and father
wanted to invite
any and all students

35:26.833 --> 35:28.876
to this afternoon's taping
of Riverdale Grandstand.

35:28.876 --> 35:31.295
Why today's?

35:31.295 --> 35:34.132
Because it's our 50th episode,
and my parents wanna see
some fresh faces on screen.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.425
Toodle-oo.

35:40.721 --> 35:43.099

how screwed up
the world is.

I know, the hypocrisy.

No matter what
we're going through,

are putting us through,

on Grandstand

smiling and dancing
like trained seals,
everything's peachy keen.

35:55.194 --> 35:58.656
And all the grownups do
is to tell us how to think,
how we're supposed to act.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.324
How to dress, who to date.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.868
They're trying to control
every second of our lives,

36:01.868 --> 36:03.202
and there's not a thing
we can do about it.
