00:53.928 --> 00:55.972
The last moments of my parent's lives...

00:57.891 --> 00:59.434
were ruined by me.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.771
When they saw me run off,

01:04.397 --> 01:05.732
they were disappointed in me.

01:06.816 --> 01:07.734
Where are you going?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.319
<i>With that, their lives...</i>

01:09.486 --> 01:10.779
Do you even have money?

01:10.862 --> 01:12.363
<i>...came to a sudden end.</i>

01:14.407 --> 01:15.825
I made it that way.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.244
I doubt that.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.833
In their last moments,
they must've thought "What a relief.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.920
What a relief that our son got off."

01:28.588 --> 01:29.881
That's what they thought.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.971
I would be living just fine.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.891
And then out of nowhere...

01:41.059 --> 01:42.894
I would remember that day.

01:44.562 --> 01:45.939
And I hated myself.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.905
I started Happiness to lessen my guilt.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.075
It was my parents' life wish...

01:58.993 --> 02:00.995
to expand Happiness.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.673
I started it because of my guilt.

02:12.924 --> 02:18.596
I didn't want to pretend
to be a good andÂ kind person.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.349
I understand everything.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.727
But it wasn't your fault.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.315
It was my fault.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.693
It wasn't your fault.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.864
It was my fault.

02:37.365 --> 02:38.575
You're a victim too.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.327
You lost your family.

02:46.207 --> 02:48.710
You just did something a little immature.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.546
An accident happened to occur
at that moment.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.049
You're a victim.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.722
Let's stop talking about this.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.566
Sorry.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.528
I made you bring up your painful past.

03:18.781 --> 03:19.782
Song Ma-rin.

03:21.701 --> 03:26.122
So far, this is all that I can tell you.

03:29.083 --> 03:29.918
I...

03:33.546 --> 03:35.381
do have secrets from you.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.301
After the accident...

03:40.136 --> 03:42.263
something unbelievable happened.

03:45.058 --> 03:45.934
For now,

03:46.976 --> 03:49.103
it's just not something I can tell you.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.234
Can you accept that
and wait a little longer?

03:56.110 --> 03:57.278
Until when?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.034
I don't know.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.914
March 25, 2019?

04:09.207 --> 04:10.124
What?

04:12.835 --> 04:13.878
There will be...

04:15.630 --> 04:17.632
<i>a fireworks festival that night.</i>

04:19.384 --> 04:21.552
<i>Let's go see that together.</i>

04:23.137 --> 04:25.139
<i>We'll watch fireworks all night.</i>

04:26.516 --> 04:27.725
<i>After that...</i>

04:31.104 --> 04:35.108
I will tell you
everything that happened to me.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.611
This thing you can't tell me...

04:40.071 --> 04:42.490
it's not something I should worry about,
is it?

04:46.661 --> 04:50.665
Unlike the accident at Namyeong Station,

04:52.250 --> 04:54.502
I'm going to make sure
I don't have any regrets.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.506
So trust me.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.679
That's a long way off.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.392
When is it again?

05:10.601 --> 05:12.020
2019.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.814
March 25.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.116
We'll be going now.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.951
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.539
I rested well for a few days.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.791
You must think this is a resort.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.752
We're not going home yet.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.003
We're going somewhere?

05:37.295 --> 05:38.296
That place.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.589
Where?

05:40.256 --> 05:41.132
That place.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.146
What are you doing for so long?

05:57.148 --> 05:58.441
I made a wish.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.610
For things to go well for you.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.153
Are they God or something?

06:04.655 --> 06:07.075
I said sorry for not knowing
who they were earlier.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.495
I'm trying to make it fun,
so that you don't feel sad.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.038
Can't you play along?

06:16.042 --> 06:18.378
"I'll be good to So-joon forever."

06:19.295 --> 06:22.048
Isn't it the kind of thing you say
to your in-laws?

06:23.716 --> 06:25.009
You wish!

06:25.385 --> 06:26.594
What about this then?

06:29.013 --> 06:31.599
"I won't ever be sick enough
to go to the hospital again.

06:32.433 --> 06:36.521
I'll make sure
your son doesn't have to worry."

06:41.776 --> 06:43.945
Why bother expecting anything from you?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.768
Wow.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.146
Home really is the best.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.649
It's so nice.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.467
What?

07:48.092 --> 07:50.845
Nothing. I feel strange.

07:53.139 --> 07:57.143
You know how people say
they feel like they've been born again?

07:58.811 --> 08:02.190
It feels like you and I have been reborn.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.736
I feel like things will work out,
whatever we do.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.197
Only good things will happen.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.866
That's just how I'm feeling.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.076
It's nice.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.207
I'll do better for you.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.461
Thank you for saying that.

08:26.589 --> 08:30.384
Then... I won't be using
that small room anymore.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.512
Of course not.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.223
Use our bedroom. I'll use the small room.

08:35.848 --> 08:36.724
What?

08:36.807 --> 08:39.393
<i>You want to keep using separate rooms?</i>

08:39.685 --> 08:42.563
How can I feel at ease
if you sleep in the small room?

08:43.397 --> 08:44.732
Use our room.

08:46.150 --> 08:49.028
<i>Why are you being like this?</i>
<i>Didn't we make up?</i>

08:50.530 --> 08:53.824
Just because I told you more about myself,

08:54.700 --> 08:58.412
I'm not assuming
you're over everything that upset you.

08:58.996 --> 09:02.208
Women aren't as simple as men.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.876
How different could they be?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.587
Two arms and two legs.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.465
-Do you know what a mimosa is?
-No.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.009
What is it? A snake?

09:12.927 --> 09:13.886
A viper?

09:15.763 --> 09:19.559
It's a very sensitive plant
that closes up when you touch it.

09:20.643 --> 09:24.730
I've decided to think of you as a mimosa.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.943
I'm going to be careful with you,
as if you're a mimosa.

09:30.194 --> 09:32.738
I'm not going to pressure you or anything.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.115
I promise you.

09:36.075 --> 09:39.287
You don't know anything about agriculture.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.080
Where did you learn about this?

09:41.998 --> 09:47.003
I can hold back and wait now.
Once you're ready to share a room...

09:47.878 --> 09:52.383
I mean, if you want to use
the same room again,

09:52.883 --> 09:53.759
give me a sign.

09:54.802 --> 09:55.970
Okay.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.430
Mimosa?

09:58.514 --> 09:59.348
Yes.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.435
Promise!

10:04.854 --> 10:05.730
Yes.

10:08.065 --> 10:08.899
Stamp.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.696
-Sign.
-No need to sign...

10:13.779 --> 10:14.739
Photocopy.

10:15.698 --> 10:16.657
Laminate.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.369
-Should we write this down?
-No.

10:32.506 --> 10:33.758
I'm so cool.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.843
So dependable!

10:36.844 --> 10:39.597
Wow, I'm so damn considerate.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.309
How? How did I come up with this?

10:44.560 --> 10:45.686
Hey, So-joon.

10:46.729 --> 10:49.649
Good manners make the man.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.405
What is this?

10:58.115 --> 11:00.159
If we made up,
we should use the same room.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.411
This is ridiculous.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.124
What was it?

11:08.542 --> 11:09.794
What is this mimosa?

11:10.294 --> 11:12.505
Where did this mimosa suddenly come from?

11:13.798 --> 11:14.757
Mimosa.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.637
<i>Mimosa flower means sensitive heart.</i>

11:20.054 --> 11:23.099
<i>When it is touched,</i>
<i>it acts like it is shy.</i>

11:23.182 --> 11:24.850
It should like being touched!

11:25.101 --> 11:26.769
It's just a measly weed.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.605
Teacher, you know the game.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.066
Can't you feel and see it?

11:32.149 --> 11:34.026
I can feel it and see it.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.737
This place is empty
and looks so common now.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.823
But it will turn into gold.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.866
I can guarantee it.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.203
Almost all of my investors are positive
about this.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.247
You need to make your move.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.874
Then we can start getting this land.
It is possible.

11:49.917 --> 11:50.751
Well...

11:52.753 --> 11:54.630
-I thought about it.
-Yes, Teacher.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.842
Leave your company now.

11:58.217 --> 12:02.596
-Then I will just...
-No, I told you before.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.223
-No.
-Leaving the company--

12:04.306 --> 12:08.269
I thought about it. Why would I invest
in something that's not upfront.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.228
Why?

12:09.478 --> 12:12.106
I don't need this. I don't need it at all.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.946
-Teacher, honestly...
-Yes.

12:19.822 --> 12:23.409
I don't know why you're helping me

12:24.577 --> 12:27.288
to start my own business,
pushing me forward.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.626
-Can I ask you why?
-I want to give you an opportunity.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.129
-An opportunity?
-Yes.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.758
Director Kim, you're ambitious.
Do you work out?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.887
I will help you grow and succeed.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.769
You almost sound like a shaman.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.023
I do have some foresight.
Let me take a look at you.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.359
Wow, Director Kim.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.529
I'm your last opportunity, Director Kim.

13:02.740 --> 13:03.574
Also, here.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.243
I brought my contract deposit.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.537
It's cash and certified checks,
1 billion won.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.665
-Excuse me?
-Oh yeah.Â That bag was too small.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.793
This is the rest. It wouldn't fit.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.505
I don't like to use banks.

13:18.380 --> 13:23.719
Would I scam you
when I'm giving you my money?

13:24.303 --> 13:26.931
I'll give the remaining 9 billion won
later when we sign.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.933
I have one condition.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.978
Once the land contract is processed,

13:33.229 --> 13:34.688
you leave Myreits.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.106
That's it.

13:37.942 --> 13:38.901
What do you think?

13:39.902 --> 13:41.946
Are you going down with the bag,

13:42.863 --> 13:44.406
or empty-handed?

13:47.743 --> 13:49.620
-I'm not doing it.
-No.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.706
No, Teacher.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.124
Well...

13:56.752 --> 13:58.546
Thank you so much for the opportunity.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.215
I will work hard.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.304
Opportunity?

14:08.264 --> 14:10.474
Giving me an opportunity? What a joke.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.521
Then are you moving forward with Jangho?

14:15.604 --> 14:18.315
Yes, the real game starts now.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.068
You need to focus now
and watch what you say.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.070
Of course, Director.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.071
I will do my best.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.535
Yu So-joon.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.662
Yu So-joon.

14:32.496 --> 14:35.749
You've had enough of your share,
you young punk.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.960
You can stop now.

14:38.502 --> 14:39.628
It's my turn.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.160
I have to look good

15:11.243 --> 15:13.537
for my mimosa.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.747
That's right.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.217
I feel bad now.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.561
<i>Flower, are you still sleeping?</i>

15:42.274 --> 15:45.569
<i>Yeah, Flower is getting up now.</i>

15:46.445 --> 15:47.780
<i>Gosh, I'm sleepy.</i>

15:53.452 --> 15:55.079
You're dead now.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.626
-Good morning, Realtor.
-Hi.

16:02.711 --> 16:03.671
What are you doing?

16:04.213 --> 16:06.757
Are you getting ready for work?

16:08.092 --> 16:11.470
Oh! I usually dress like this at home.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.933
You do?
But it'll be hard to exercise in that.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.018
Exercise?

16:20.187 --> 16:21.146
What exercise?

16:21.897 --> 16:24.400
Let's go jogging. Get changed first.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.111
No, I don't like to exercise.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.822
I only do it once or twice a year.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.865
One of those days is today.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.243
-Get changed.
-Then let's think of an exercise

16:34.952 --> 16:37.079
we could do at home instead of outside.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.288
At home?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.583
I'd like to do that too,

16:41.667 --> 16:43.836
but jogging is best outside.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.087
Go get changed.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.132
Go on.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.176
One, two...

16:54.722 --> 16:56.682
Your doctor says you need to get more fit.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.143
We should exercise every morning.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.185
Sounds good, right?

17:00.269 --> 17:03.480
I thought you don't like to exercise.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.858
-Yeah.
-You never exercise.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.193
I'll try hard, now.

17:08.610 --> 17:09.611
It's good!

17:11.488 --> 17:13.782
That's good and all.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.702
It's not good for people
to change so suddenly.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.956
Why do you think there's a saying,
"people die if they change too suddenly?"

17:23.876 --> 17:28.255
Can't we just live a long and simple life?

17:28.922 --> 17:32.551
I like you the way you are.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.845
If you have the strength to talk, run!

17:34.928 --> 17:35.888
Focus!

17:37.931 --> 17:39.183
I don't know.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.393
Don't use all your energy for running!

17:42.436 --> 17:45.355
Breathe.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.442
Do you think this is really what I want?

17:50.027 --> 17:51.028
Don't you like this?

17:54.490 --> 17:57.743
Maybe he doesn't feel
a sexual desire for you.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.163
He's so good to me,
I don't think that's it.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.291
Hello.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.418
-Hello.
-Hello! You're all here?

18:06.960 --> 18:10.714
-Kids, go in and practice your drills.
-Okay.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.466
I'll be in soon.

18:13.008 --> 18:13.884
Good.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.056
When you're a newlywed,

18:20.099 --> 18:23.268
I heard you do it in during meals
and in the middle of the night.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.104
While running the washing machine--

18:26.188 --> 18:28.273
Can't you hear
the innocent children playing?

18:29.274 --> 18:32.444
So do you think newlyweds
are slaves to lust?

18:33.362 --> 18:34.822
You watch too many weird things.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.698
Don't watch any more porn.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.743
No, friends of mine
who got married were like that.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.497
They said they could barely rest.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.791
Whether it was day or night,

18:45.874 --> 18:47.960
they would just look at each other.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.795
They would look away, then look again.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.505
Every time their eyes met,

18:51.588 --> 18:54.466
they would do it so hard
that their noses bled.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.594
-It was just crazy.
-Stop it.

18:58.929 --> 19:02.432
You look so conservative,
but you get so excited about this stuff.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.768
It's because I'm lonely.

19:06.019 --> 19:06.937
I'm lonely too.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.189
Very lonely.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.695
I don't need a lot.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.156
I just want to be in the same bed
with him.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.824
Just be honest with him.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.952
Do you need to hold back
because you're a woman?

19:22.578 --> 19:24.413
It's not an issue about women and men.

19:25.330 --> 19:29.418
Realtor has suddenly become very pure.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.129
Very pure and sincere.

19:33.505 --> 19:37.676
He's like a freshly ironed white shirt.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.137
I feel like I can't get dirt on it.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.514
I shouldn't touch it either.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.975
I feel like I'm some staining material.

19:47.394 --> 19:50.981
Anyway, I feel very awkward
to approach him first.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.192
I did rebuff him a lot, too.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.945
People often use separate rooms
and are comfortable.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.157
Apparently, many couples
use separate rooms forever.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.408
Really?

20:01.533 --> 20:04.036
So if you feel weird

20:04.119 --> 20:07.956
being all blatant towards him,

20:08.957 --> 20:11.126
just be subtle.

20:12.628 --> 20:13.921
Seduce him.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.506
How can I be subtle about it?

20:18.425 --> 20:19.551
Manager Shin.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.511
Wait.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.348
Well...

20:25.766 --> 20:28.769
About what you said yesterday,
did you mean it?

20:29.436 --> 20:30.312
Are you really...

20:31.939 --> 20:33.315
going to quit?

20:34.816 --> 20:37.236
Yes. Keep it to yourself for now.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.412
It seems like you haven't been in touch
with Se-young lately.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.998
I saw her at Happiness' house opening.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.002
You haven't met her separately, right?

20:54.544 --> 20:55.420
Hey, Kang Ki-doong.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.172
Yes?

20:57.714 --> 21:01.051
If you feigned innocence,
did you think I wouldn't know?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.137
When did I feign innocence?

21:05.305 --> 21:07.933
You pretended not to care, but...

21:09.142 --> 21:10.394
your heart couldn't resist?

21:12.771 --> 21:13.814
What?

21:15.732 --> 21:16.942
So, you do have feelings.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.530
Stop saying that nonsense.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.616
No matter what, she's a friend.
How could--

21:24.700 --> 21:27.160
Still, you shouldn't have touched
my babies.

21:27.869 --> 21:28.704
Babies?

21:29.037 --> 21:30.831
Take them off while I'm asking nicely.

21:31.832 --> 21:35.210
Take your dirty feet
out of my sacred sneakers.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.878
They're just shoes.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.047
Do you think they're made for wearing?

21:39.756 --> 21:41.341
I've never worn them myself.

21:41.675 --> 21:44.761
I went to the other world many times
just to get a pair.

21:44.845 --> 21:45.721
You're so petty.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.390
-I won't get them dirty.
-You're not taking them off?

21:49.099 --> 21:50.350
Come on.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.352
You're really not?

21:52.436 --> 21:54.855
I'll keep them clean, so don't worry.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.024
What are you doing? What!

21:57.107 --> 21:58.567
That hurts. My back hurts!

21:58.650 --> 22:00.777
My back hurts. Ouch! Hey!

22:00.861 --> 22:04.197
-Take them off.
-Hey, hey!

22:04.281 --> 22:06.825
-They're mine.
-Okay. All right.

22:10.412 --> 22:14.041
If you're going to come in
right after you knock,

22:14.124 --> 22:15.792
why bother knocking at all?

22:15.959 --> 22:19.046
You should wait at least three seconds
for a response.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.381
I... I'm sorry.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.176
It's just that Director Kim...

22:25.218 --> 22:27.512
It's nothing. Oh, my.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.640
Shouldn't you finish what you were doing?

22:30.724 --> 22:32.726
You can be more gentle.
I should lower this.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.854
-I didn't see a thing.
-Hey. Gosh!

22:39.775 --> 22:40.817
Jeez.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.110
<i>Are you datingÂ Ki-doong?</i>

22:42.652 --> 22:43.779
Someone told me

22:44.446 --> 22:46.156
that you two are living together.

22:48.492 --> 22:49.409
Where are you going?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.329
Chairman Yu likes Manager Kang more.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.498
In the middle of the day, at the office.

22:54.581 --> 22:55.916
I shouldn't have seen that.

22:56.041 --> 22:59.461
-Secretary Hwang.
-Yes, Chairman.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.048
What's that look on your face?

23:03.590 --> 23:06.176
It seems like you're imagining something.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.804
What could you be imagining?

23:09.221 --> 23:11.223
I was thinking about my mom. Mom?

23:11.932 --> 23:13.266
-Secretary Hwang?
-Yes.

23:18.313 --> 23:20.774
Are you imagining the same thing
as Hwang, Director?

23:21.483 --> 23:22.317
Excuse me?

23:22.859 --> 23:24.111
My goodness.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.950
Do you have time this evening?

23:30.867 --> 23:32.994
Why don't we have dinner with our wives?

23:34.454 --> 23:37.499
I'm not busy this evening.
My wife, as well?

23:37.582 --> 23:40.127
Yes. I would like to see her today.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.421
I think we have a lot to discuss.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.092
-Over here.
-Oh!

23:47.843 --> 23:49.803
Why are we eating out all of a sudden?

23:51.430 --> 23:52.597
This place looks nice.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.307
We have to meet someone today.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.101
Who?

23:56.393 --> 23:57.269
Ki-doong?

23:57.352 --> 23:58.186
No.

23:58.770 --> 24:02.983
The person who started the rumorÂ about us
that I don't even want to repeat.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.317
Gun-sook?

24:05.819 --> 24:09.448
How did you know
Gun-sook said those things?

24:09.990 --> 24:10.949
You just said it.

24:13.493 --> 24:14.453
Let's go.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.496
Let's go punish Gun-sook.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.004
How is it being newlyweds?

24:24.546 --> 24:28.300
There are many things you have
conflicts over, aren't there?

24:29.551 --> 24:33.597
No, it's honey-fun.
What about you, Honey?

24:35.015 --> 24:36.266
It's honey-fun for me, too.

24:38.643 --> 24:39.644
What's "honey-fun"?

24:41.521 --> 24:43.148
It means fun, something like that.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.065
I see.

24:45.817 --> 24:48.695
Chairman, you don't careÂ much
about keeping up appearances.

24:50.030 --> 24:53.950
You must end up
with many misunderstandings about you.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.911
I'm not here as a chairman today.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.830
I'm here as Flower's husband.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.583
Treat me as the husband
of one of your friends.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.336
Flow...

25:05.587 --> 25:08.006
He calls me that for fun, Flower.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.007
For fun.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.930
Honey, don't bother cutting that.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.765
Eat this.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.850
You'll get tired cutting that.

25:19.392 --> 25:20.268
Thank you.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.604
Here. These are yours, Honey.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.274
She's just so delicate,

25:26.733 --> 25:28.735
I can't take my eyes off of her
for a moment.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.278
She's like a baby.

25:32.447 --> 25:35.075
Honey, you have to chew your food well.

25:35.158 --> 25:36.326
Here's some warm water.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.662
-What are you doing?
-Drink up.

25:39.829 --> 25:40.664
Oh, my.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.798
Excuse me a moment.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.885
Must be work again.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.929
All he knows is work.

25:57.389 --> 26:01.226
I've always been curious about something.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.770
How did the two of you meet?

26:07.232 --> 26:08.233
It was fate.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.737
She's so pretty, cute, and sexy.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.407
It's rare to find a woman
who does cute things, too.

26:15.991 --> 26:16.992
At first sight...

26:19.369 --> 26:24.874
I wondered to myself,
how could a beauty like this exist?

26:26.960 --> 26:28.169
I'm so happy.

26:32.882 --> 26:35.760
Honey, you're so affectionate today.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.347
Calm down.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.392
Oh, stop that. You're too cute.

26:46.187 --> 26:48.648
With such a woman living with me,

26:48.982 --> 26:50.400
calling me "honey" every day,

26:50.483 --> 26:52.819
I literally melt every single day.

26:56.865 --> 26:57.949
I'm so happy.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.451
I need to go to the restroom.

26:59.534 --> 27:00.410
Should I go with?

27:00.493 --> 27:02.203
No, it's okay. Thank you.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.288
Come back soon.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.418
I can't bear to take my eyes off her.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.964
When would I have the time
to look at another person?

27:14.299 --> 27:15.508
Especially a man, at that.

27:16.718 --> 27:17.594
Excuse me?

27:17.677 --> 27:20.221
I'm saying you don't need to worry
about Ma-rin.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.558
Please be nice to her.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.852
Stop playing tricks on her.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.439
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

27:30.857 --> 27:33.735
Where did he learn how to be
so cheesy like that?

27:36.029 --> 27:38.448
I do like it, though.

27:39.532 --> 27:40.784
How embarrassing.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.578
It's embarrassing just thinking about it.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.378
I don't know
why Chairman Yu said no to Jangho.

27:51.461 --> 27:52.629
It's clearly a mistake.

27:52.712 --> 27:53.588
No.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.715
A monkey has fallen from a tree.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.092
You can trust me on this.

27:58.093 --> 28:02.430
Chairman Yu's biggest investor
has already come to me on this.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.515
Yes.

28:03.765 --> 28:09.354
Actually, it's his money
that's pushing this project forward.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.648
What do you think this means?

28:12.190 --> 28:15.068
It means that my judgment is correct. Yes.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.821
Yes, Chairman. Thank you.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.031
I will await your reply.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.119
-Yeah.
-Yes, Chairman.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.246
I lost my way back from the restroom.

28:26.329 --> 28:27.455
I'll be right there.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.750
What are you doing here?

28:32.585 --> 28:34.879
I'm not very good with directions.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.091
Did you get lost too, Director?

28:39.134 --> 28:40.760
It is a little confusing here.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.762
Have you been here for a long time?

28:42.846 --> 28:44.222
Yes... no.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.142
Let's go. It's this way.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.436
It's so confusing here.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.897
It's a very big place.

28:55.275 --> 28:58.069
He said your investor was with him now.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.029
It's okay.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.240
I won't be ruined
because he takes an investor.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.492
We're all in the same company anyway.

29:06.286 --> 29:09.205
It didn't feel that simple.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.461
I'm being careful with my words here.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.632
It felt veryâ¦ how should I put it?

29:21.301 --> 29:23.887
It was strange and shady.

29:24.512 --> 29:25.764
I didn't like it.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.810
He seems to be on guard around you.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.937
He might do some petty things to me,

29:33.021 --> 29:34.939
but it doesn't mean he's a bad person.

29:35.356 --> 29:36.900
He works very hard too.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.944
Why? Are you that worried about me?

29:41.362 --> 29:43.031
Well...

29:44.491 --> 29:46.075
Who would dare to mess with me?

29:46.659 --> 29:49.621
There's nothing about me
they can even mess with.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.165
Don't worry.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.586
I don't know where you got
all that confidence from.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.550
Am I overreacting?

30:11.810 --> 30:13.812
What's going on for you to call so late?

30:13.895 --> 30:16.064
<i>Sorry. I called because I think</i>

30:16.731 --> 30:18.983
<i>the investment will be complete</i>
<i>by tomorrow.</i>

30:19.067 --> 30:19.901
Is that so?

30:20.527 --> 30:23.404
<i>Yes, I spoke to the last investor.</i>

30:23.488 --> 30:26.282
He is much more optimistic
than I expected.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.370
You can assume
that this project will move forward.

30:31.204 --> 30:34.541
Once we have the investors,
I will proceed with the contract.

30:34.958 --> 30:39.796
<i>Then that means</i>
<i>you will have to leave Myreits.</i>

30:39.879 --> 30:42.173
Yes, I will leave.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.883
Mr. Kim Yong-jin,

30:45.260 --> 30:50.640
don't forget what I said about this being
an opportunity for you.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.977
Yes, I won't forget.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.019
Thank you.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.729
Okay. Bye, then.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.414
So-joon can't know about this.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.418
Yes, I did it.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.548
I'm the leader and I'm the winner.

31:31.598 --> 31:32.849
Wow, this thing!

31:58.499 --> 32:00.168
<i>Don't only say what I want.</i>

32:00.251 --> 32:03.296
<i>Listen to Realtor, and wait.</i>

32:05.840 --> 32:09.302
<i>Even if you fought and are angry,</i>
<i>always make sure to talk.</i>

32:09.969 --> 32:11.554
<i>But we have nothing to fight over.</i>

32:11.638 --> 32:12.513
Yeah, right.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.727
<i>Tell him things</i>
<i>to give him courage and strength.</i>

32:18.436 --> 32:20.939
<i>Realtor, you are the best. Awesome!</i>

32:32.241 --> 32:34.994
<i>Why is there a newspaper from next year</i>
<i>in our house?</i>

32:39.374 --> 32:40.667
<i>Is he a spy?</i>

32:42.293 --> 32:43.211
<i>Spy?</i>

32:44.420 --> 32:45.672
<i>What is he?</i>

32:47.423 --> 32:49.258
<i>I've married a strange man.</i>

32:51.302 --> 32:53.680
<i>No, you shouldn't doubt him.</i>

32:55.765 --> 32:59.394
<i>But does he even really love me?</i>

33:07.819 --> 33:09.570
Everything is so perfect.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.906
But why do I feel empty?

33:14.283 --> 33:15.660
I'm so happy.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.579
Why am I not full of joy?

33:20.081 --> 33:23.084
<i>People often use separate rooms</i>
<i>and get comfortable.</i>

33:23.209 --> 33:25.586
<i>Apparently, many couples</i>
<i>use separate rooms forever.</i>

33:26.337 --> 33:28.339
<i>Just be subtle.</i>

33:29.007 --> 33:30.466
<i>Seduce him.</i>

33:30.883 --> 33:32.468
<i>So that he can't wait!</i>

33:33.344 --> 33:36.431
Subtle, so that he can't wait.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.563
Should I give in for the sake of us?

33:45.982 --> 33:46.983
Realtor.

33:48.609 --> 33:49.444
Yeah.

33:49.819 --> 33:50.903
What are you doing?

33:51.571 --> 33:52.405
Nothing much.

33:52.947 --> 33:54.574
I thought you were sleeping.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.371
When we were eating dinner with Gun-sook,

34:01.456 --> 34:03.541
you were a little over the top, darling.

34:05.960 --> 34:06.919
Darling?

34:07.503 --> 34:10.548
You called me a baby, Darling.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.342
Oh, that.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.011
Shall we watch TV?

34:15.094 --> 34:16.179
Where's the remote?

34:17.889 --> 34:18.848
Just look at me.

34:21.017 --> 34:23.186
You said you couldn't take your eyes
off of me.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.105
You said I make you melt.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.983
I heard everything earlier.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.946
I'm so embarrassed.

34:35.990 --> 34:37.033
Hold me.

34:37.116 --> 34:41.788
Earlier... I was trying to clarify
my sexual identity to Gun-sook.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.998
-I wanted to show that we were...
-Come on.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.793
-Why do you keep saying "Come on?"
-Pat me on the back.

34:47.794 --> 34:49.128
Do it.

34:50.379 --> 34:51.672
Here.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.300
Let's drink beer. You like it.

34:54.383 --> 34:56.135
I don't want to be drunk
when we do it.

34:57.553 --> 34:58.763
Do what?

34:59.347 --> 35:00.181
What?

35:00.556 --> 35:03.351
Being drunk when we do what?

35:05.394 --> 35:06.229
My legs hurt.

35:06.312 --> 35:08.106
They hurt so much.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.858
Why do they hurt so much?

35:12.360 --> 35:14.153
My back feels all wrong too.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.657
What do you say?
Do you want to give me a massage?

35:19.534 --> 35:21.202
Should I call you a Thai masseuse?

35:23.996 --> 35:25.456
It's not that bad.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.457
Okay.

35:29.085 --> 35:32.630
Are you seducing me, by any chance?

35:36.384 --> 35:38.970
No. Did it seem like I was?

35:39.053 --> 35:41.639
Oh no.Â It didn't seem that way...

35:42.223 --> 35:44.392
I won't do anything if you say no.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.603
I... I almost misunderstood you just now.

35:48.312 --> 35:51.649
You seemed very impatient.

35:52.900 --> 35:53.985
It's not that.

35:54.068 --> 35:55.653
It's not, right?

35:55.736 --> 35:59.282
I'm so stupid. IÂ have a dirty mind.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.159
I'm so sorry.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.870
Then, sleep well.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.705
Be careful of me.

36:22.471 --> 36:23.848
So embarrassing.

36:24.849 --> 36:28.603
<i>Discovered in hot South Africa,</i>

36:28.686 --> 36:32.190
<i>Mimosa's flower means sensitive heart.</i>

36:32.315 --> 36:33.149
Mimosa!

36:33.232 --> 36:35.693
<i>When touched, it acts as if it is shy.</i>

36:36.110 --> 36:37.820
See if I make a move again.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.698
He is so dull!

36:44.869 --> 36:47.788
I did not do anything.

36:48.831 --> 36:51.876
I did not lust after him.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.669
I'm a man too.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.215
I can't stand it anymore.

36:59.133 --> 37:00.676
But I have to.

37:01.844 --> 37:04.138
Because I'm a gentleman.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.611
BUILDING HOUSES AND CHANGING LIVES

37:19.737 --> 37:21.739
Wow. It is really big here.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.741
How many units will there be?

37:23.824 --> 37:24.742
Eight.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.244
Looks good, right?

37:26.327 --> 37:29.580
It's the biggest one we've built
at Happiness.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.791
Wow, you are really capable.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.501
You're the best.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.419
What did I do?

37:35.503 --> 37:37.338
It's all from the donations.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.424
There's one particular person
who donates a lot.

37:41.217 --> 37:44.053
I don't know who it is,
but he made big contributions.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.555
-Let's go this way.
-Okay.

37:46.889 --> 37:49.141
He's talking about So-joon.

37:49.308 --> 37:50.434
He was!

37:54.689 --> 37:55.815
Why don't you pick up?

37:55.898 --> 37:56.941
It's Ki-doong.

37:57.358 --> 37:58.818
How can I pick up the phone now?

37:59.527 --> 38:00.569
What did your dad say?

38:00.861 --> 38:02.071
He must be upset.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.991
I'm going to take my time telling him.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.994
You should be honored
that I told you first.

38:10.371 --> 38:11.956
I'm going to leave within a month.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.083
What's the big rush?

38:14.709 --> 38:17.211
The company in Japan is in a rush.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.922
What if you go there
and find it difficult?

38:20.339 --> 38:21.966
What if it's job fraud?

38:22.049 --> 38:24.468
It's my school senior's company
and kind of small.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.138
But they're pretty stable
and it's a good company.

38:27.596 --> 38:28.806
Is he a good person?

38:29.181 --> 38:31.475
Did he hit on you in school or anything?

38:31.559 --> 38:33.102
He has three daughters now.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.063
He's as trustworthy as my dad.

38:37.356 --> 38:39.942
Okay. Go if you want to.

38:40.026 --> 38:42.028
Yeah, I'm going to.

38:43.779 --> 38:45.197
I'd go further away if I could.

38:46.115 --> 38:49.827
You eat in a hurry
and you leave in a hurry too.

38:50.870 --> 38:54.165
Yeah, so tell me quickly
that you're upset to see me go.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.834
Even if you're not upset,
just say that you are.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.920
Live your life
the way you want.

39:00.046 --> 39:03.090
Since you're going to leave,
go with a light heart.

39:03.549 --> 39:05.926
Japan is so close, anyway.

39:09.555 --> 39:10.389
So-joon.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.016
Yeah?

39:20.274 --> 39:21.692
Are you going to eat all that?

39:22.568 --> 39:24.153
Why? Should I order you a new one?

39:24.236 --> 39:25.154
Let me take some.

39:26.155 --> 39:27.323
Why eat the one I ate?

39:27.406 --> 39:28.449
Just order a new one.

39:28.532 --> 39:31.369
It's fine.
We shared ramen when we were younger.

39:31.452 --> 39:34.497
We even shared the same candy.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.874
That's when we were total kids.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.542
That was still you.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.087
Well...

39:41.879 --> 39:44.340
I consider you in the past to be you now.

39:44.965 --> 39:47.551
You talk about the past
as if it's nothing.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.848
Where else
would all of our memories reside?

40:06.862 --> 40:09.073
Ki-doong, I forgot to call you back.

40:09.156 --> 40:11.158
This films my front door, right?

40:11.450 --> 40:12.410
Did you check?

40:12.535 --> 40:15.704
Do you want to move out on your own
or do you want to get kicked out?

40:16.205 --> 40:17.998
I didn't put one in your room.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.876
Do you do weird things in the living room?

40:20.960 --> 40:22.420
Yeah, I do a lot!

40:22.503 --> 40:25.214
I love doing weird things.Â I enjoy it.

40:25.297 --> 40:26.632
Why? Because it's my house.

40:26.715 --> 40:29.635
How long do you plan
on living that way? Hey.

40:32.179 --> 40:34.432
Do you have
some sort of voyeuristic tendencies?

40:34.515 --> 40:36.767
Are you curious about my private life,
you psycho?

40:36.851 --> 40:39.937
I met you in the other world
on December 3rd.

40:40.062 --> 40:44.358
I told you.
I have no interest in your other world.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.153
The future you told me nonsense,

40:48.154 --> 40:50.239
that I should break up with Ma-rin.

40:50.990 --> 40:51.866
I did?

40:52.116 --> 40:55.244
You said things weren't good between us
after getting married.

40:56.829 --> 40:57.788
But...

40:59.165 --> 41:00.833
I don't think that I can do that.

41:01.917 --> 41:04.920
I can't let things go bad or break up.

41:06.422 --> 41:09.091
I will never run away.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.136
Why would you run away?

41:12.219 --> 41:15.639
I put these up
because I need to find that out.

41:18.851 --> 41:20.144
You have to help me.

41:21.228 --> 41:22.188
FLOWER

41:22.271 --> 41:26.942
So, you want me to save
the CCTV footage in this folder,

41:27.026 --> 41:29.445
and you're going to go to the future
and look at it?

41:31.655 --> 41:35.659
At the very least,
I'll know what happens here.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.168
Thanks, friend.

41:44.418 --> 41:45.419
I'll call you.

41:46.629 --> 41:48.088
Thanks so much.

41:48.714 --> 41:49.757
I love you.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.384
You must be so glad
to have a friend like me.

41:52.468 --> 41:54.720
You need to be grateful to me forever.

41:55.054 --> 41:56.263
I'll see how you do first.

41:56.722 --> 41:59.808
-Where are you going?
-To see how you did on your assignment.

42:00.017 --> 42:02.144
I'm going to get the files
from the other world.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.688
Gosh, that's so complicated.
Get out of here.

42:04.772 --> 42:08.275
I'm going to think
about time and space for a while.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.945
Your brain can't handle it.
Just accept it.

42:12.321 --> 42:15.407
Se-young said
she's going to work in Japan.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.909
-Have you heard?
-What?

42:16.992 --> 42:19.495
I met her earlier
and she suddenly said that.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.706
You should call her later.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.708
We should do a goodbye party or trip.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.378
Let's set something up.
We can't just send her off.

42:28.837 --> 42:31.715
Put all the files in the Flower folder,
okay?

42:47.523 --> 42:48.899
SHIN SE-YOUNG

42:55.030 --> 42:55.990
I'm not picking up.

42:57.700 --> 42:58.784
This one looks good.

42:59.285 --> 43:00.202
Try it on.

43:02.037 --> 43:04.790
This is Yu So-joon's style.
It looks like kids' shoes.

43:05.666 --> 43:07.418
Do you have to bring up Yu So-joon?

43:07.751 --> 43:09.545
I'm out here buying you shoes!

43:09.628 --> 43:11.130
I said I don't want it.

43:11.213 --> 43:12.798
Why are you buying me a pair?

43:13.132 --> 43:16.010
Did you hear something from So-joon?
That I took his sneakers?

43:16.093 --> 43:18.262
Stop bringing up Yu So-joon.

43:19.388 --> 43:21.515
I don't like seeing you wear
those old ones.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.059
Do you think I'm buying them
because I like you?

43:24.476 --> 43:25.853
I don't want to buy them now.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.272
What's wrong with mine?
What? What's so old?

43:28.355 --> 43:30.524
Stop complaining and choose a pair.

43:30.608 --> 43:34.028
Here we go. These ones.
These are Kang Ki-doong style.

43:35.237 --> 43:36.447
Are you blind?

43:37.531 --> 43:38.365
I don't want any.

43:40.492 --> 43:42.578
-Kang Ki-doong, come back.
-I don't want them.

43:42.661 --> 43:44.455
Come back before I count to three.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.707
One, two...

43:48.042 --> 43:49.251
I'm here. What now?

43:49.335 --> 43:52.713
I think the ones I chose are
the most stylish.

43:52.796 --> 43:54.214
Just get the ones I picked.

43:54.882 --> 43:56.050
They're the best ones.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.677
Whatever. Do what you want.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.054
I'm not thankful at all.

44:01.680 --> 44:04.058
I'm not thankful at all, but thanks.

44:04.391 --> 44:05.392
I'll wear them well.

44:06.685 --> 44:09.146
I'm getting insulted
even after buying them for you.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.358
Forget it. Let's go eat.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.234
No, I want to go.Â See you next time.

44:14.318 --> 44:16.236
You're not even going to buy me a meal?

44:16.320 --> 44:18.030
Didn't you buy me these
to get lost?

44:19.073 --> 44:22.368
If you were going to tell me about Japan
over dinner, forget it.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.620
I already know.

44:25.829 --> 44:27.206
I heard from So-joon.

44:32.711 --> 44:34.254
Then why didn't you say anything?

44:35.673 --> 44:38.634
It seems like
you keep making angry remarks.

44:38.717 --> 44:41.303
This is a goodbye present, right?

44:42.388 --> 44:45.099
-It is, right?
-It is. So, what?

44:45.182 --> 44:46.225
So, thanks.

44:46.308 --> 44:48.686
I'll make good use of them.
You're great. Good luck.

44:48.977 --> 44:50.813
I don't know
why you're taking that tone.

44:51.230 --> 44:52.773
Why are you getting mad at me?

44:52.856 --> 44:55.025
What did I do?

44:56.068 --> 44:57.778
I said thank you!

44:58.445 --> 44:59.905
I said farewell.

45:00.447 --> 45:02.491
Thank you and goodbye!

45:04.952 --> 45:08.455
Am I supposed to get emotional
because you bought me shoes?

45:31.019 --> 45:31.854
What is this?

45:32.604 --> 45:33.981
Why is it only up to October?

45:34.398 --> 45:35.899
Kang Ki-doong.

45:36.358 --> 45:38.110
He stopped after a few days?

45:41.155 --> 45:42.531
I should take this for now.

45:55.002 --> 45:58.964
They say your future is in your hands.
Literally, in this case.

46:08.849 --> 46:09.683
Flower.

46:10.225 --> 46:12.019
Should I buy some red bean bread?

46:14.146 --> 46:15.189
Hello?

46:15.939 --> 46:16.940
Anyone here?

46:18.525 --> 46:19.651
Is no one here?

46:31.872 --> 46:33.707
Oh, Ma-rin.

46:34.792 --> 46:35.959
What brings you here?

46:39.129 --> 46:40.047
You're...

46:41.381 --> 46:43.258
not the Yu So-joon that I know, are you?

46:49.389 --> 46:50.849
You're from the past.

46:54.728 --> 46:58.106
You... found out everything.

46:59.399 --> 47:00.275
I know it all.

47:01.693 --> 47:03.362
I know you're a time traveler.

47:04.655 --> 47:05.614
Yes.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.283
You must have been surprised.

47:11.161 --> 47:12.871
You're being very cold to me.

47:21.588 --> 47:24.258
Did I make you this way?

47:26.093 --> 47:29.513
Why did things go wrong for us?

47:30.514 --> 47:31.849
What other reasons are there?

47:33.350 --> 47:35.978
-Our feelings faded.
-I shouldn't have asked.

47:36.353 --> 47:37.521
I'm not curious at all.

47:41.358 --> 47:42.860
Your future will change too.

47:43.735 --> 47:45.028
When you wake up,

47:45.195 --> 47:49.366
I will be by your side,
as if nothing happened.

47:50.868 --> 47:53.620
You won't even remember

47:53.704 --> 47:55.289
meeting me here.

47:57.082 --> 48:00.586
You hating me won't have ever happened.

48:00.669 --> 48:01.837
Are you still doing that?

48:05.465 --> 48:07.718
We never should have met.

48:09.553 --> 48:10.596
You and I...

48:12.598 --> 48:14.391
were never meant to meet.

48:14.808 --> 48:17.019
You forcefully changed the future.

48:19.271 --> 48:20.564
That's why this happened.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.317
How much do you know?

48:24.401 --> 48:25.569
Once you return...

48:26.862 --> 48:28.947
end things with me as soon as you can.

48:30.574 --> 48:34.286
Put my life back the way it was.

48:36.997 --> 48:37.956
I don't want to.

48:44.046 --> 48:44.963
I like you.

48:49.426 --> 48:52.554
I'm scared that you'll change like this.

48:54.556 --> 48:58.018
So I've been so careful around you lately.

48:59.686 --> 49:02.856
I'm worried that you'll hate me.

49:04.024 --> 49:04.900
No,

49:06.318 --> 49:07.819
I'm worried that you'll get hurt.

49:09.237 --> 49:11.698
I'm just careful about everything.

49:13.659 --> 49:14.576
Yet stillâ¦

49:16.828 --> 49:17.704
I'm happy.

49:21.083 --> 49:23.210
I certainly like you.

49:23.919 --> 49:26.254
And I will certainly continue to like you.

49:28.924 --> 49:31.802
You're talking
as if you don't remember any of it.

49:33.595 --> 49:35.222
That's why I'm telling you this.

49:36.640 --> 49:37.557
I remember.

49:43.355 --> 49:44.982
Even though it was brief.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.528
That moment...

49:51.363 --> 49:53.031
is everything to me right now.

50:03.709 --> 50:07.462
Has Se-young not left for Japan yet?

50:09.923 --> 50:13.010
If she hasn't left for Japan yet,
don't let Se-young leave.

50:15.387 --> 50:16.638
That's all I have to say.

50:45.584 --> 50:47.002
<i>I'm not in Seoul right now.</i>

50:47.294 --> 50:49.046
<i>Can you come pick me up?</i>

50:49.129 --> 50:51.840
<i>I'm waiting. Call me when you get this.</i>

50:54.509 --> 50:56.178
Where are you? Is something wrong?

51:08.440 --> 51:10.609
Ma-rin, are you okay?

51:10.984 --> 51:12.152
Are you hurt?

51:12.235 --> 51:13.445
I was waiting for you.

51:13.528 --> 51:14.613
Come sit.

51:16.698 --> 51:19.743
Gosh! You scared me.

51:19.826 --> 51:22.621
I made a little fire to set the mood.

51:23.246 --> 51:24.081
Hurry up.

51:24.289 --> 51:26.458
Are you shooting a horror film
or something?

51:26.541 --> 51:28.919
What kind of mood can we have
at a construction site?

51:29.002 --> 51:32.464
-You have to come here every time?
-But it's nice, isn't it?

51:33.131 --> 51:34.800
Were you here alone?

51:36.635 --> 51:38.845
What kind of girl stays here alone
so fearlessly?

51:39.679 --> 51:43.308
This complex is being built thanks to you.

51:46.353 --> 51:48.396
I wanted you to see it
when no one is around.

51:49.147 --> 51:51.108
A lot of your effort has gone into it.

51:53.026 --> 51:56.113
You wouldn't have come
unless I did something like this.

51:56.196 --> 51:57.489
So I played a little trick.

51:58.281 --> 52:00.617
I even refused a ride
from the board director.

52:03.995 --> 52:07.332
Still, you shouldn't be
at a construction site alone.

52:07.833 --> 52:09.793
Stop lecturing me.

52:10.127 --> 52:11.294
It's so nice here.

52:14.256 --> 52:16.258
I'm relieved nothing happened to you.

52:18.552 --> 52:21.346
Then will you be taking pictures here?

52:22.472 --> 52:23.348
Yes.

52:24.266 --> 52:27.352
I'll be keeping
a record of them building this.

52:28.270 --> 52:30.147
They'll use it for promotional purposes.

52:30.564 --> 52:32.816
There's a photo exhibition
at the end of the year.

52:35.569 --> 52:38.280
I guess you're officially going to work
at Happiness.

52:40.073 --> 52:44.035
Yeah, there will be many opportunities
to take good pictures,

52:44.744 --> 52:46.413
and it's something important to you.

52:47.247 --> 52:48.874
It's also a family business.

52:49.749 --> 52:53.044
Aren't I being a good daughter-in-law
to the Yu family?

52:57.090 --> 52:59.467
Here you go.Â Oh, it's hot.

52:59.551 --> 53:00.510
What is it?

53:01.011 --> 53:01.970
I...

53:03.930 --> 53:05.473
prepared this for you.

53:05.557 --> 53:07.100
-It's so hot.
-Here. I'll do it.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.268
No, no.

53:08.602 --> 53:11.938
You'll get soot on your hands.
I'll peel it for you to eat.

53:13.523 --> 53:14.357
Here.

53:16.985 --> 53:18.403
It looks good, right?

53:20.363 --> 53:22.073
You've never roasted potatoes, right?

53:24.576 --> 53:27.037
-Isn't this a sweet potato?
-No, it's a potato.

53:27.579 --> 53:28.413
Oh, it is.

53:29.456 --> 53:30.665
It looks good, doesn't it?

53:30.749 --> 53:32.500
-Can I eat it?
-Yes. Try it.

53:36.046 --> 53:37.631
Be careful. It's hot.

53:44.012 --> 53:45.805
-Is it good?
-No.

53:48.642 --> 53:49.851
What was that?

53:50.852 --> 53:52.979
-It's good, right?
-It is.

53:54.564 --> 53:57.359
Did you take any pictures today?

53:57.734 --> 53:59.444
Show me if you did.

53:59.903 --> 54:03.240
Today, I spent my time gettingÂ friendly
with the construction crew.

54:04.449 --> 54:06.159
Look at the ones
from the 30th house?

54:07.035 --> 54:09.788
Everyone loved
how the pictures turned out.

54:10.956 --> 54:12.999
My talent is just exploding.

54:13.583 --> 54:14.459
Take a look.

54:18.046 --> 54:20.048
I'm relieved that everyone liked them.

54:20.507 --> 54:21.967
Start from here.

54:33.895 --> 54:35.230
Are you touched by that one?

54:35.981 --> 54:38.441
Be quiet. I'm looking.

54:43.363 --> 54:45.365
I hope we can grow old together like them.

54:50.078 --> 54:51.079
What?

54:53.748 --> 54:55.458
I was just thinking the same thing.

55:00.171 --> 55:02.507
Marriage is really amazing.

55:04.968 --> 55:08.555
We didn't really know each other
just a few months ago.

55:10.765 --> 55:11.725
Now,

55:13.101 --> 55:15.770
we're planning out
the rest of our lives together.

55:19.691 --> 55:23.611
Even when I'm an old grandma,
you will be there with me.

55:24.195 --> 55:25.864
I think that's so amazing.

55:30.744 --> 55:31.661
I know.

55:32.412 --> 55:34.831
You and I were never meant to meet.

55:36.374 --> 55:37.417
<i>Once you return,</i>

55:38.335 --> 55:40.378
end things with me as soon as you can.

55:40.837 --> 55:44.341
Put my life back the way it was.

55:46.926 --> 55:49.054
What do you think we'll be like
when we're old?

55:49.971 --> 55:52.098
I wish I had a time machine
to see for myself.

55:56.144 --> 55:56.978
Realtor.

55:57.854 --> 56:01.024
What would you want to do
if you could go to the future?

56:01.858 --> 56:02.692
Stocks?

56:03.860 --> 56:04.986
Lottery?

56:07.530 --> 56:10.116
You could see
what land will increase in value.

56:10.700 --> 56:12.327
That is your job.

56:13.536 --> 56:14.496
Hold on.

56:14.579 --> 56:15.538
Why?

56:17.290 --> 56:18.541
Do I have soot on my face?

56:18.958 --> 56:19.793
Yes.

56:20.794 --> 56:22.170
Here? Here too?

56:30.095 --> 56:32.305
I'm not the type
to get stuff on my face.

56:32.722 --> 56:34.099
Maybe it's on my hands.

56:35.809 --> 56:36.810
Am I really dirty?

56:37.894 --> 56:40.355
No. You're so pretty.

56:41.356 --> 56:42.273
You're cute.

56:46.403 --> 56:48.613
I wish every day was like today.

56:52.367 --> 56:53.368
Me too.

56:57.831 --> 56:59.499
Oh, that looks good.

57:02.585 --> 57:05.922
Cooking is so easy
when the kitchen is this big.

57:09.634 --> 57:11.177
It was good today, right?

57:11.553 --> 57:12.470
It was.

57:13.138 --> 57:14.139
-Oh, my!
-What!

57:14.222 --> 57:16.057
Why would you get scared
seeing your mom?

57:16.266 --> 57:18.643
Oh, my son!

57:18.726 --> 57:20.061
You're coming home now?

57:20.145 --> 57:21.020
Hello, Mother!

57:21.688 --> 57:24.107
How did you get in?
How did you get a key?

57:24.190 --> 57:27.026
My son gave me one last time.

57:28.027 --> 57:30.613
My son wanted me to come
whenever I want to.

57:30.738 --> 57:32.240
I gave her one.
I did good, right?

57:33.116 --> 57:35.410
You must be hungry. I cooked for you.

57:35.535 --> 57:37.662
-Oh, then I'll wash up.
-Okay.

57:39.122 --> 57:40.373
You cooked, Mom?

57:40.457 --> 57:42.041
I made what I'm good at.

57:42.125 --> 57:43.376
You must be crazy.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.128
The pork is really good.

57:45.670 --> 57:47.672
-I made soybean paste stew.
-Don't make that.

57:47.755 --> 57:50.383
-Well, then. There's mackerel.
-Don't do mackerel.

57:51.009 --> 57:52.427
-There's noodles.
-No noodles.

57:52.510 --> 57:53.845
I bought these.

57:54.679 --> 57:56.890
-This is the only store-bought?
-Yes. Taste it.

58:00.602 --> 58:04.147
I didn't prepare much,
but enjoy your meal, son.

58:04.230 --> 58:06.232
Mother, thank you for the food.

58:08.359 --> 58:09.194
You eat too.

58:11.988 --> 58:13.698
What is it? Is something wrong?

58:14.240 --> 58:16.117
No. It's just so good.

58:16.201 --> 58:17.494
You can be honest.

58:17.911 --> 58:19.579
My mom needs to know the truth.

58:21.414 --> 58:24.542
I see that Ma-rin learned
to cook from you.

58:24.626 --> 58:26.920
-My cooking is that good?
-My cooking is that bad?

58:28.213 --> 58:31.633
I meant that they were both good.

58:34.302 --> 58:35.386
You shouldn't...

58:38.890 --> 58:42.185
This stew is very unique and modern.

58:42.310 --> 58:45.230
It's like art. It's great.

58:46.648 --> 58:49.359
Just consider the thought put into it
and eat up.

58:49.442 --> 58:51.528
-Food is all about effort.
-Sure.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.948
Here, I will make a lettuce wrap.

58:57.075 --> 58:58.284
Oh, Mom.

58:58.952 --> 58:59.911
Yeah?

59:00.161 --> 59:03.665
-Did you say you're staying over?
-Huh? Did I?

59:08.503 --> 59:10.129
You said you were sleeping over.

59:11.130 --> 59:13.466
You should sleep here. It's late.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.260
There's a room upstairs.

59:15.343 --> 59:16.678
Should I do that?

59:17.178 --> 59:18.638
Something's up, right?

59:18.721 --> 59:20.306
There's nothing.

59:20.390 --> 59:23.101
It's late.Â Get some good sleep tonight.

59:23.184 --> 59:25.979
Something's going on.
Why won't you tell me?

59:26.229 --> 59:27.730
Am I supposed to live here, then?

59:27.897 --> 59:30.233
One day can turn into two.
Two can turn into a year.

59:30.650 --> 59:32.151
Why would you say such a thing?

59:32.694 --> 59:33.778
Go to bed.

59:33.861 --> 59:34.821
Sleep tight.

59:34.946 --> 59:37.865
So-joon is a light sleeper,
so don't come downstairs.

59:37.949 --> 59:39.325
What if I need the bathroom?

59:39.409 --> 59:41.661
Go to sleep. A bathroom is right there.

59:41.744 --> 59:43.162
-Okay.
-Bye.

59:43.288 --> 59:44.247
Good night.

59:44.330 --> 59:45.790
Good night.

59:47.959 --> 59:48.876
Gosh.

59:49.502 --> 59:52.171
This is nice and soft.

59:52.255 --> 59:54.007
Oh so good!

59:54.591 --> 59:55.550
Oh my.

59:56.676 --> 59:59.429
Thanks to my daughter,
I get to sleep on this nice bed.

1:00:37.592 --> 1:00:39.260
We became her parents,

1:00:40.178 --> 1:00:41.763
and never did anything for her.

1:00:43.097 --> 1:00:45.475
All we did was cause her suffering.

1:00:50.104 --> 1:00:53.941
Your daughter is living
in this big house now.

1:00:55.443 --> 1:00:58.613
She wasn't blessed with good parents,
just a good husband.

1:01:07.413 --> 1:01:08.247
Realtor.

1:01:08.748 --> 1:01:10.041
Wait a second.

1:01:12.251 --> 1:01:14.545
-You're going to sleep in there?
-What?

1:01:16.381 --> 1:01:17.715
My mom is here.

1:01:18.966 --> 1:01:20.259
Oh, right.

1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:22.053
If we use separate rooms...

1:01:22.470 --> 1:01:24.889
She'll worry and think we're fighting.

1:01:25.890 --> 1:01:29.936
A lifestyle like ours is not common.

1:01:30.937 --> 1:01:32.855
It won't be easy to understand.

1:01:34.190 --> 1:01:35.066
Then...

1:01:35.149 --> 1:01:36.192
What else?

1:01:36.776 --> 1:01:39.987
We need to pretend to use one room
while my mom is here.

1:01:41.864 --> 1:01:42.907
Should we?

1:01:43.157 --> 1:01:45.743
I guess we have no choice, right?

1:01:45.827 --> 1:01:46.994
We have no choice.

1:01:47.078 --> 1:01:48.037
Yes.

1:01:48.996 --> 1:01:49.872
Okay.

1:02:24.031 --> 1:02:26.367
Good night, Mimosa.

1:02:30.037 --> 1:02:30.997
You too.

1:03:04.071 --> 1:03:05.406
What, what?

1:03:06.866 --> 1:03:08.075
I'm so thirsty.

1:03:08.326 --> 1:03:09.410
Should I get you water?

1:03:11.496 --> 1:03:12.330
No, thanks.

1:03:16.834 --> 1:03:18.211
So hot.

1:03:19.879 --> 1:03:21.255
I can get it for you.

1:03:24.550 --> 1:03:26.260
Where is the hula hoop?

1:03:33.142 --> 1:03:37.897
Must you be the one
wrapped around my waist tonight?

1:03:45.822 --> 1:03:47.114
What are you doing here?

1:03:49.075 --> 1:03:50.034
Can't you see?

1:03:50.701 --> 1:03:51.994
I'm doing the hula hoop.

1:03:52.662 --> 1:03:55.623
Why are you doing that so late?

1:03:55.706 --> 1:03:56.582
Leave me be.

1:03:57.959 --> 1:04:00.545
I'm overflowing with strength.
I'm so hot.

1:04:01.337 --> 1:04:03.381
Sleep tonight.
Tomorrow morning, we can--

1:04:03.464 --> 1:04:04.841
I don't like mornings.

1:04:05.049 --> 1:04:06.759
I'm a night person.

1:04:08.386 --> 1:04:09.554
Okay, then.

1:04:10.388 --> 1:04:11.472
Don't go overboard.

1:04:11.806 --> 1:04:13.975
They say too much
can harm your intestines.

1:04:14.809 --> 1:04:16.727
Ruin my intestines? Yeah, right.

1:04:17.228 --> 1:04:19.689
Hey! Yu So-joon.

1:04:19.772 --> 1:04:20.606
Yeah?

1:04:20.690 --> 1:04:22.441
Why are you so dull?

1:04:23.651 --> 1:04:26.070
How many more signs do I need to give you?

1:04:26.737 --> 1:04:30.867
You asked me for a sign
if I'm ready and open.

1:04:31.242 --> 1:04:32.743
Should I actually sign something?

1:04:33.870 --> 1:04:35.496
Bring a pen. I'll sign something.

1:04:35.913 --> 1:04:36.747
Okay.

1:04:43.671 --> 1:04:45.882
Look at this.
You're pretending to be innocent.

1:04:46.299 --> 1:04:48.551
Earlier, you kept touching me
and set the mood,

1:04:48.634 --> 1:04:50.970
when I didn't even have soot on my face.

1:04:51.304 --> 1:04:52.388
Are you teasing me?

1:04:53.723 --> 1:04:54.807
Did you feel teased?

1:04:55.308 --> 1:04:56.309
I didn't know.

1:04:58.394 --> 1:04:59.270
Don't smile.

1:05:01.147 --> 1:05:02.064
Then...

1:05:02.940 --> 1:05:06.027
you like me, right?

1:05:06.110 --> 1:05:08.946
Did I ever not like you?

1:05:09.947 --> 1:05:12.617
Did I act like you were a man
I didn't like?

1:05:13.034 --> 1:05:13.868
No.

1:05:15.036 --> 1:05:17.288
I just wanted to hear it
from you directly.

1:05:19.665 --> 1:05:20.541
I love you.

1:05:24.253 --> 1:05:26.380
As for that secret you can't tell me yet,

1:05:27.465 --> 1:05:29.008
I'm not curious at all anymore.

1:05:29.383 --> 1:05:31.886
I just love you, no matter what.

1:05:32.261 --> 1:05:33.596
I love you, Yu So-joon.

1:05:37.850 --> 1:05:38.851
You can have me.

1:05:40.269 --> 1:05:41.520
I want to have you too.

1:06:46.210 --> 1:06:49.338
<i>Will tomorrow be as happy as today?</i>
