Colleen, I never thought
that we’d end up here...

18:48.041 --> 18:50.166
in an airport hotel
getting married

18:50.166 --> 18:51.917
in front of a luggage rack,
a prostitute,

18:51.917 --> 18:53.125
and only some of our family,

18:53.125 --> 18:56.375

beautiful place in the world

wanna interrupt, I wasn’t--

-...just say your vows, yeah.

Matt...

19:12.542 --> 19:15.333
this is not
the wedding I expected,

19:15.333 --> 19:18.458
but I never expected to fall
so deeply in love,

19:18.458 --> 19:20.709
or to find someone
who makes every setback

19:20.709 --> 19:22.709
feel like an adventure.

19:22.709 --> 19:25.500
This has been
an insane and bumpy road,

19:25.500 --> 19:27.709
but I would take it
again and again

19:27.709 --> 19:29.542
