03:41.973 --> 03:44.241
Shh.

03:44.275 --> 03:46.010
Shh, hey, it's okay.

03:47.578 --> 03:49.213
Shh.

03:49.246 --> 03:52.249
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, shh,
shh, shh.

03:52.283 --> 03:54.118
It's just a nightmare.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.152
Hey, hey.

04:05.896 --> 04:07.198
Wanna tell me about it?

04:07.231 --> 04:10.067
Oh, I knew you'd ask me that.

04:12.636 --> 04:15.206
Oh, just go, you stink of
cigars.

04:15.239 --> 04:17.208
Sometimes it's best to talk
about it.

04:19.877 --> 04:21.679
You're weird.

04:23.114 --> 04:25.549
Am I?

04:43.134 --> 04:44.135
You sleep okay?

05:34.718 --> 05:36.720
Sleepover.

05:36.754 --> 05:37.755
Or is it tomorrow?

05:39.290 --> 05:40.691
It's too thick, isn't it?

05:41.826 --> 05:43.194
They don't even like me.

05:43.227 --> 05:46.864
You mean you don't even like
them?

05:46.897 --> 05:47.998
What's not to like?

05:48.032 --> 05:50.067
They've only known you two
months.

05:50.101 --> 05:52.036
You're the new girl on the
block.

05:52.069 --> 05:53.170
On the block?

05:53.204 --> 05:54.271
Queen of the Scottish castle.

05:54.305 --> 05:57.908
Oh, don't say that, I hate
it when people say that.

06:04.682 --> 06:07.017
Where are all your friends,
anyway?

06:07.051 --> 06:08.752
Why is it just me who
has to make an effort?

06:08.786 --> 06:10.254
One, I do make an effort.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.723
And two, you're the one
finishing school today.

06:12.756 --> 06:14.325
I don't want you moping
about in your room all day

06:14.358 --> 06:15.527
not seeing anyone.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.028
You seem to have made a
pretty good career out of that.

06:18.062 --> 06:20.197
Yes, but I get paid for it.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.435
You could pay me.

06:23.468 --> 06:27.405
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

06:31.108 --> 06:34.311
It was the perfect blend!

06:47.958 --> 06:48.792
Bee, wait.

06:48.826 --> 06:49.860
- I'm late, Dad.
- Wait,

06:49.894 --> 06:51.162
I wanna show you something.

06:52.897 --> 06:53.864
Close your eyes.

06:53.898 --> 06:55.467
- What?
- Please.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.700
No tricks.

07:00.371 --> 07:03.240
Ladies and gentlemen, behind
these boards

07:03.274 --> 07:05.276
is the seed of what lies ahead,

07:05.309 --> 07:06.277
a vision of what is yet to be.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.778
Do not be afraid.

07:07.811 --> 07:08.647
It may appear as magic,

07:08.679 --> 07:10.848
but I can assure you, it's only
theatre.

07:11.982 --> 07:13.050
The makeover.

07:14.486 --> 07:17.087
Which is your favourite, two or
six?

07:17.121 --> 07:19.023
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

07:19.056 --> 07:20.991
I prefer it as it is.

07:22.427 --> 07:23.260
You're absolutely right,

07:23.294 --> 07:24.762
- it's more...
- Ugly.

07:24.795 --> 07:26.263
Yes.

07:28.098 --> 07:31.101
Bee, can you at least show
some excitement about all this?

07:31.135 --> 07:34.038
Forget the paint, I mean the
whole thing.

07:34.071 --> 07:35.739
This place, our new life.

07:35.773 --> 07:38.209
I didn't want a new life.

07:38.242 --> 07:40.010
I'm trying to make things
better for us.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.813
There's something here, I can
feel it.

07:42.846 --> 07:45.216
I'm alive, I'm alive!

07:45.249 --> 07:48.085
- The "Living Play."
- The "Living Play," Bee.

07:48.118 --> 07:50.821
- A play that has to be...
- Has to be experienced,

07:50.854 --> 07:52.856
not merely seen.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.893
Hundreds of people exploring
multiple rooms all at once.

07:55.926 --> 07:56.894
Yes.

07:56.927 --> 08:00.864
Props, costumes, sound
design, special effects.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.099
Yes.

08:02.132 --> 08:05.236
Actors bring history alive
under one terrifying narrative.

08:05.269 --> 08:08.072
- Yeah, a living...
- A living piece of shit.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.075
See you later, dad.

08:12.209 --> 08:14.011
Don't write anything I wouldn't
do.

08:20.418 --> 08:23.455
My patience is thin, Mr.
Bremner.

08:24.522 --> 08:26.491
What exactly are you asking?

08:34.599 --> 08:35.933
One more week, sir.

08:39.504 --> 08:40.505
One more week, sir.

08:41.338 --> 08:45.309
My boys, they'll work in
the fields until I can pay.

08:45.342 --> 08:47.211
They're fit, strong...

08:49.313 --> 08:53.451
If I wanted labourers,
I'd employ labourers.

09:00.224 --> 09:01.225
I have a daughter.

09:04.295 --> 09:09.300
And what area of employment
would you presume upon your...

09:10.535 --> 09:12.136
And what area of employment

09:12.169 --> 09:14.972
would you presume upon this
daughter?

09:19.511 --> 09:22.212
She, uh, a maidservant, or...

09:28.052 --> 09:29.053
Or?

12:26.764 --> 12:29.701
Hi, you must be our new
neighbour.

12:33.303 --> 12:34.304
I'm Jenny.

12:35.807 --> 12:36.608
Bee.

12:36.641 --> 12:38.275
It's nice to finally meet you,
Bee.

12:39.811 --> 12:41.679
- Is that short for...
- Beleth.

12:43.113 --> 12:46.083
Beleth, oh, that's nice.

12:47.485 --> 12:48.453
Well, we've been curious to know

12:48.486 --> 12:50.020
who's moved into the castle.

12:51.154 --> 12:53.056
So, your parents with you?

12:53.090 --> 12:54.091
My dad.

12:55.460 --> 12:57.094
Is he gonna fix the place up?

12:57.862 --> 12:59.531
Guess you could say that,
yeah.

13:01.866 --> 13:03.367
Gets awful lonely up here.

13:04.769 --> 13:07.204
My dad's a writer,
that's kind of the point.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.340
Be good to catch him sometime.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.510
You sure about that?

13:13.578 --> 13:15.713
Jack Travis, look him up.

13:26.791 --> 13:28.526
Guessing the sheds are
cleared.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.300
I see you got the TV working.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.435
It's been working for ages.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.169
Did you even hear what
I said?

13:39.904 --> 13:42.205
Something about making tea or
something?

13:57.889 --> 13:59.390
Where's that tea?

13:59.424 --> 14:00.458
No, no!

14:00.491 --> 14:01.759
You can get out there
and take down those sheds

14:01.793 --> 14:03.428
like I've been asking for weeks.

14:03.461 --> 14:05.195
Oh, yeah, 'cause no one's
gonna buy your granny's house

14:05.228 --> 14:06.664
if there's some nasty sheds in
the garden.

14:06.698 --> 14:08.733
Not if they're falling
apart, they won't.

14:11.803 --> 14:13.270
Your family should've
sold this place ages ago,

14:13.303 --> 14:14.672
your granny's been dead for
years.

14:14.706 --> 14:16.273
- Callum!
- What?

14:16.306 --> 14:17.307
I'm not being funny.

14:17.341 --> 14:18.543
You've got to admit,
it's pretty awful timing.

14:18.576 --> 14:21.813
Us having to come all the way
up here and sort it out now.

14:22.747 --> 14:24.749
We're supposed to be taking a
year out.

14:26.350 --> 14:29.219
Is it too cold and
windy in the far north

14:29.252 --> 14:30.655
for poor wee Callum?

14:30.688 --> 14:33.424
More like it's too boring and
shite.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.325
Yeah, well, that's life.

14:35.359 --> 14:36.561
Look, you'd only be sat on your
ass

14:36.594 --> 14:38.563
watching TV somewhere else
anyway.

14:38.596 --> 14:39.664
Oh, what was that?

14:41.766 --> 14:43.835
Oh, oh, and what's that,
Callum?

14:43.868 --> 14:46.336
Is that the sound of a big,
manly man

14:46.370 --> 14:47.672
smashing sheds to pieces?

14:47.705 --> 14:49.373
I'll smash you to pieces.

14:49.407 --> 14:50.875
Fat chance.

14:50.908 --> 14:53.176
After everything I've
done for you, Jenny?

14:53.210 --> 14:55.413
Look, you'll get a tea
if you do some bloody work.

14:55.446 --> 14:56.381
Oh, sorry, did I say tea?

14:56.414 --> 14:58.449
I meant coffee.

14:58.483 --> 15:01.386
Coffee helps me do manly things.

15:08.426 --> 15:10.428
Jack Travis in the castle.

15:11.529 --> 15:12.797
What was that?

15:12.830 --> 15:13.665
What?

15:13.698 --> 15:14.899
You said a name.

15:14.932 --> 15:16.366
Um, Jack Travis.

15:17.669 --> 15:18.736
The writer?

15:20.672 --> 15:21.673
Two seconds.

15:25.443 --> 15:27.445
Here he is, Jack Travis.

15:28.413 --> 15:29.580
What?

15:29.614 --> 15:32.684
Jack Travis is famous, man,
has to be.

15:32.717 --> 15:33.584
Look, he's had this hit West End
play

15:33.618 --> 15:36.421
that scared the shite out of
everyone.

15:36.454 --> 15:38.656
Horrorpreneur, what is that?

15:38.690 --> 15:40.858
I guess it's somebody that's
an expert in scaring people.

15:41.759 --> 15:42.994
That is awesome.

15:43.027 --> 15:45.897
Yeah, well, why has he moved
here?

15:46.798 --> 15:48.733
Jack Travis in the frigging
castle.

16:01.479 --> 16:02.847
Katie, truth or dare?

16:02.880 --> 16:03.881
Dare.

16:04.949 --> 16:09.352
Okay, I dare you to down
all of that drink in one go.

16:09.387 --> 16:10.655
- I can't.
- Come on.

16:10.688 --> 16:12.957
- No.
- Come on.

16:12.990 --> 16:13.958
Yes.

16:13.991 --> 16:15.325
♪ We like to dine with Katie ♪

16:15.358 --> 16:16.861
♪ 'Cause Katie is our mate ♪

16:16.894 --> 16:17.595
♪ We like ♪
Come on.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.630
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.
- Yeah, come on.

16:21.432 --> 16:22.433
That burns.

16:22.967 --> 16:26.571
Okay, Alex, truth or dare?

16:26.604 --> 16:27.605
Truth.

16:28.539 --> 16:29.741
Okay.

16:29.774 --> 16:33.444
What was the name of your first
ever

16:36.047 --> 16:36.881
pet?

16:36.914 --> 16:37.915
Lame.

16:38.883 --> 16:40.384
You had a pet called Lame?

16:40.418 --> 16:43.521
Ha ha, no.

16:44.422 --> 16:45.523
Bee's turn.

16:45.556 --> 16:50.260
Oh, queen of the castle,
do your worst.

16:53.363 --> 16:54.966
Ticktock, ticktock.

16:57.835 --> 17:00.571
Katie, truth or dare?

17:00.605 --> 17:02.573
Um, truth.

17:02.607 --> 17:03.908
Lame.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.376
Everybody's frigging lame.

17:07.011 --> 17:09.013
Why are you really friends
with Alex?

17:13.117 --> 17:15.887
What sort of a shite question
is that?

17:15.920 --> 17:18.422
Why am I friends with Alex?

17:18.456 --> 17:19.924
'Cause we're friends?

17:19.957 --> 17:21.759
I said, why are you really her
friend?

17:21.793 --> 17:23.461
This is fricking stupid.

17:24.796 --> 17:29.801
Uh, 'cause I like her and
she likes me.

17:30.234 --> 17:32.670
Like, honest to god.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.005
All right, Bee, truth.

17:34.705 --> 17:37.340
Why do you think Katie's
friends with me, hmm?

17:38.543 --> 17:39.544
I don't know.

17:40.111 --> 17:44.015
Maybe because you make her
feel better about herself,

17:45.049 --> 17:48.920
because she's secretly a
good girl and you're a slag.

17:51.689 --> 17:52.690
What the fuck?

17:55.827 --> 17:57.762
What game are you playing at,
woman?

17:59.063 --> 18:00.798
We had an agreement.

18:06.037 --> 18:09.140
I, I couldn't help it, Campbell.

18:09.173 --> 18:10.775
He knew already.

18:16.147 --> 18:18.850
Then a curse be on your
footsteps

18:18.883 --> 18:21.953
as you bring service to this
household.

18:32.530 --> 18:34.732
This comes from a girl who
sits at the back of the class

18:34.765 --> 18:36.801
drawing dragons and
bats all over her work.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.069
At least I can draw.

18:38.102 --> 18:39.770
Oh, who gives a
shite?

18:39.804 --> 18:41.505
That's just weird.

18:41.539 --> 18:43.441
And how old is your dad,
anyway?

18:43.474 --> 18:46.010
Must have been about 15 when he
had you.

18:46.043 --> 18:49.513
Oh, touched a nerve.

18:49.547 --> 18:51.015
At least I know who my dad is.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.585
Uh, piss off, you arrogant
cow.

18:54.619 --> 18:55.887
You think you're all so high and
mighty

18:55.920 --> 18:57.421
in your frigging castle, don't
you?

18:57.455 --> 18:58.389
I'd rather live here

18:58.422 --> 19:00.625
than on some shitty
council estate in Wick.

19:00.658 --> 19:02.159
And I'd rather live in
the back of a bin lorry

19:02.193 --> 19:04.662
than this shitehole of
a haunted castle anyway.

19:04.695 --> 19:06.764
Oh my god, a bin
lorry.

19:06.797 --> 19:07.465
You do know why no one else

19:07.498 --> 19:09.133
would come here for a sleepover?

19:09.166 --> 19:10.434
I don't think she
knows.

19:10.468 --> 19:11.535
This should be good.

19:19.543 --> 19:21.479
It was a cold, dark

19:21.512 --> 19:23.714
- and stormy night.
- Shut up.

19:23.748 --> 19:27.718
The rain lashed at the
roof tiles like an old granny

19:27.752 --> 19:29.587
pissing herself on the kitchen
floor.

19:29.620 --> 19:31.222
Oh, that's nasty.

19:31.255 --> 19:34.992
Okay, so there was this evil
baron who used to live here

19:35.026 --> 19:39.797
called Laird Mackay or some
shite who everyone hated.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.232
And the scandal was,

19:41.265 --> 19:44.535
he was shagging his
housekeeping maid, Tabitha.

19:44.568 --> 19:47.672
And obviously she got
up the duff, pregnant.

19:48.973 --> 19:51.976
So they had this son, Alasdair,

19:52.009 --> 19:54.211
who, when he was older one
night,

19:54.245 --> 19:57.248
blurts out in front of all
of the Laird's dinner guests,

19:57.281 --> 19:59.183
"My mother's not my real mother.

19:59.216 --> 20:02.153
"My mother's the frigging
maid, you bunch of culls."

20:04.588 --> 20:06.257
But that's the nice part.

20:06.290 --> 20:10.761
Laird Mackay chased Alasdair
all the way down to the cellar

20:10.795 --> 20:12.730
here he spent the whole night

20:12.763 --> 20:15.199
building an entire wall around
him,

20:15.232 --> 20:18.869
leaving him to thirst and starve
for days.

20:19.670 --> 20:23.774
And night after night, Alasdair
would cry out for help,

20:24.475 --> 20:29.547
and not even his mother, his
real mother, came to save him.

20:30.815 --> 20:33.217
But there was one who did come.

20:34.719 --> 20:37.054
The devil.

20:37.088 --> 20:38.990
The devil made a pact with
Alasdair.

20:40.658 --> 20:43.094
"You may have your revenge
in this place, Alasdair,

20:43.828 --> 20:48.899
"but you will do my work
for eternity."

20:48.933 --> 20:51.769
Next thing you know, Tabitha is
found dead

20:51.802 --> 20:55.206
at the bottom of the
staircase, every bone broken.

20:56.273 --> 20:58.676
Laird Mackay went insane,

20:58.709 --> 21:01.946
threw himself out of the
highest window in the castle.

21:01.979 --> 21:03.047
Or so they say.

21:03.748 --> 21:06.083
Some say, if you put
your hands to the wall

21:06.117 --> 21:07.918
where Alasdair was buried alive,

21:07.952 --> 21:09.820
you can still hear his screams.

21:09.854 --> 21:12.590
His screams to be set
free again.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.794
That's ridiculous.

21:16.827 --> 21:18.095
Then prove it.

21:18.129 --> 21:19.597
Dare.

21:19.630 --> 21:22.266
I dare you to put your hands on
the wall.

21:24.001 --> 21:25.236
What's the point?

21:25.269 --> 21:27.571
It's just a wall.

21:27.605 --> 21:29.807
A pact with the devil?

21:29.840 --> 21:31.776
Then what are you worried
about?

21:31.809 --> 21:32.743
The only thing I'm worried
about

21:32.777 --> 21:34.745
is looking completely stupid.

21:34.779 --> 21:38.049
Well, you already
kinda are, so.

21:41.018 --> 21:43.154
You two are doing it as well.

21:43.187 --> 21:45.623
Aye.

21:45.656 --> 21:48.826
You left me no choice,
Tabitha.

21:48.859 --> 21:51.195
Please, Mackay, he's just a boy.

21:52.797 --> 21:54.265
And a boy he shall remain.

21:56.200 --> 22:00.704
Let him go, far from here.

22:00.738 --> 22:03.040
You're his mother, Tabitha.

22:03.074 --> 22:06.610
Would you wish him away so far
from home?

22:26.398 --> 22:28.766
Oh my God, is this it?

22:29.800 --> 22:30.801
It has to be.

22:33.070 --> 22:34.071
Okay, who's first?

22:35.306 --> 22:36.707
You's can frig off.

22:37.708 --> 22:38.709
Bee?

22:40.144 --> 22:41.145
Stupid question.

23:04.168 --> 23:05.169
Hm.

23:07.238 --> 23:08.305
Okay, Bee, your turn.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.875
What about Katie?

23:10.908 --> 23:11.909
It's your castle.

23:17.181 --> 23:20.985
This is so stupid.

24:21.845 --> 24:22.846
Hey.

24:34.559 --> 24:36.827
Sorry if I acted like a bitch
yesterday.

24:38.430 --> 24:40.097
I don't think that.

24:40.998 --> 24:43.133
Why do you think you were?

24:44.235 --> 24:45.302
I just hate school.

24:47.071 --> 24:48.072
So did I.

24:52.843 --> 24:53.911
So why the castle?

24:55.346 --> 24:58.215
It's kind of a big old
place for just two people.

24:58.249 --> 24:59.517
My dad's kind of...

25:02.152 --> 25:03.521
He writes weird stuff.

25:07.958 --> 25:09.360
What was his last one about?

25:13.498 --> 25:14.499
Never watched it.

25:16.568 --> 25:18.335
You never watched your dad's
play?

25:28.112 --> 25:29.313
What's he working on how?

25:30.482 --> 25:32.249
He has this crazy idea.

25:32.283 --> 25:33.117
What?

25:33.150 --> 25:34.151
I can't say.

25:36.086 --> 25:37.389
I won't tell anyone.

25:42.394 --> 25:45.929
It's immersive, um,
like a walkaround play.

25:49.066 --> 25:50.067
In the castle?

25:55.105 --> 25:56.106
What's it about?

26:01.979 --> 26:03.914
Maybe you should come over
sometime.

30:46.196 --> 30:48.833
Shit, I'm just making this
worse.

30:48.866 --> 30:50.668
You're gonna have to
come and do this, love.

30:53.236 --> 30:55.640
Since when did you ever iron a
shirt?

30:55.673 --> 30:58.241
Exactly, that's exactly my
point.

30:58.275 --> 31:00.478
Who are these people
anyway, the crease police?

31:02.747 --> 31:04.482
You don't have to come.

31:04.515 --> 31:07.150
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, uh,
wine and cheese in a castle?

31:07.184 --> 31:08.519
No, I think I might just stay
home,

31:08.553 --> 31:10.320
maybe iron the rest of my
clothes.

31:13.958 --> 31:16.159
So this girl just invited us
over, then?

31:16.894 --> 31:18.596
She's just being nice.

31:18.630 --> 31:20.565
Yeah, well, let's hope they
are, eh?

31:21.933 --> 31:23.735
You can always leave.

31:23.768 --> 31:26.303
What do you mean, "You
can always leave"?

31:26.336 --> 31:28.338
I'm beginning to think
you don't want me there.

31:28.372 --> 31:30.775
I didn't mean...

31:33.711 --> 31:36.447
Apparently her dad likes his own
company.

31:37.882 --> 31:39.684
Okay, so why are you going,
then?

31:42.387 --> 31:44.689
Look, Jenny, if I
had something better to do,

31:44.722 --> 31:46.724
believe me, I would go and do
it.

31:46.758 --> 31:49.560
Leave you with all the
socialising with famous writers.

31:51.361 --> 31:52.930
I honestly don't know
how your family survived

31:52.964 --> 31:54.866
growing up round here, I really
don't.

32:02.473 --> 32:05.643
People are afraid of the
dark, aren't they?

32:05.677 --> 32:10.715
It's as though we can just all
forget our deepest troubles

32:10.748 --> 32:13.885
by sitting in a circle,
and stroke some kittens,

32:13.918 --> 32:18.489
and do some mindfulness
exercises.

32:18.523 --> 32:20.858
There's this idea that we're
like, um,

32:23.260 --> 32:24.261
wheelie bins.

32:25.997 --> 32:26.998
Here we go.

32:27.031 --> 32:28.633
No, seriously.

32:28.666 --> 32:32.870
This idea that we're all
just full of rubbish, okay,

32:32.904 --> 32:35.473
and that all we need
to do is just empty it

32:35.506 --> 32:38.376
and do some breathing, stroke an
iguana,

32:38.409 --> 32:39.577
listen to some whale song

32:39.610 --> 32:43.448
and bang, it's all
gone.

32:44.247 --> 32:46.484
What would you do with all
this rubbish instead, then?

32:46.517 --> 32:47.685
Well, uh,

32:47.719 --> 32:49.787
if we are going for the
wheelie bin analogy,

32:49.821 --> 32:53.558
which is mine, thank you,
what I would say

32:53.591 --> 32:55.760
is that we need to, uh,

32:56.527 --> 33:00.565
look closely at what's in
the rubbish, go through it

33:00.598 --> 33:04.936
and find what's in there
that might be, uh...

33:07.038 --> 33:08.206
Rubbish.

33:09.807 --> 33:13.411
No, um, no, useful.

33:15.513 --> 33:17.982
But isn't it so much easier
to just pay the council tax

33:18.015 --> 33:20.551
and have someone take
it all away?

33:20.585 --> 33:21.886
No self-examination needed.

33:21.919 --> 33:24.589
Well, I suppose that's
the problem, isn't it?

33:24.622 --> 33:26.524
It's always about what's
easiest.

33:26.557 --> 33:27.925
Take Jack, okay?

33:27.959 --> 33:31.829
Jack's got his own troubles,
his own rubbish, hm?

33:31.863 --> 33:34.364
You're a writer, I imagine
you use it to write.

33:35.133 --> 33:38.436
You can't write without
some serious reflection,

33:38.469 --> 33:40.303
some self-examination, right?

33:40.337 --> 33:41.472
Oh, you can.

33:41.506 --> 33:42.874
Okay, okay, you can.

33:42.907 --> 33:45.943
But I mean, it wouldn't
be any good, would it?

33:45.977 --> 33:49.380
All you have to do is, you
have to go back to your life,

33:49.413 --> 33:54.385
examine your rubbish, and in
some way turn it into fuel.

33:55.686 --> 33:59.690
I mean, for example, uh, hm,

33:59.724 --> 34:01.993
what was it that fueled
you to buy this place?

34:04.796 --> 34:05.797
A witch.

34:10.568 --> 34:11.636
Sorry, did I say witch?

34:11.669 --> 34:14.038
I meant estate agent.

34:17.542 --> 34:18.576
Oh, you got me.

34:18.609 --> 34:21.078
That just sort of fitted,
didn't it?

34:21.112 --> 34:22.480
See?

34:22.513 --> 34:25.917
Jack's not afraid to go to dark
places.

34:25.950 --> 34:27.552
That's where people find
themselves.

34:27.585 --> 34:28.753
If we don't know what we're
afraid of,

34:28.786 --> 34:31.455
then how can we know anything at
all?

34:31.489 --> 34:33.858
We know ourselves from
the decisions we make.

34:38.462 --> 34:39.964
Yeah, okay, to a degree,
but...

34:39.997 --> 34:41.098
Why don't we ask Bee?

34:42.834 --> 34:44.969
Bee, what's that short for
again?

34:45.002 --> 34:46.671
I told you, Beleth.

34:48.472 --> 34:50.775
Oh, isn't Beleth a demon?

34:50.808 --> 34:51.976
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:52.009 --> 34:53.144
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:53.177 --> 34:56.447
He's the, one of the gods
of hell, isn't he?

34:56.480 --> 34:59.851
He had like 85 legions of
demons, of...

35:15.433 --> 35:16.934
Why would a Cambridge student

35:16.968 --> 35:20.004
decide to have a child
before he graduated?

35:24.508 --> 35:25.710
Okay.

35:25.743 --> 35:28.746
Or maybe it was because he
didn't decide to have a child.

35:28.779 --> 35:30.681
- Maybe it just happened...
- That's enough.

35:30.715 --> 35:33.517
And he thought, can't change
shit now.

35:33.551 --> 35:34.886
That's enough.

35:34.919 --> 35:37.521
Bee, Bee, wait.

35:39.790 --> 35:41.726
What is all that shit in your
office?

35:41.759 --> 35:43.461
What, this place is haunted?

35:43.494 --> 35:44.528
Don't be ridiculous.

35:44.562 --> 35:46.864
Well, what's with the
paranormal murder inquiry

35:46.898 --> 35:48.032
pinned to your fucking wall?

35:48.065 --> 35:50.801
It's nothing, it's
just folklore and rumours.

35:50.835 --> 35:53.738
And you're all over it
like a fly around shit.

35:53.771 --> 35:54.906
That's enough.

35:56.574 --> 35:59.744
We wouldn't even have this
place if it wasn't for all that.

35:59.777 --> 36:03.514
I never even wanted this
place.

36:03.547 --> 36:06.117
God, Mum was right, it's all
about you.

36:06.984 --> 36:08.185
You're messed up.

36:16.027 --> 36:17.828
You listen here, Beleth.

36:17.862 --> 36:20.698
I am this close to something
great.

36:20.731 --> 36:22.166
Thousands of people will come
here

36:22.199 --> 36:25.169
and experience something they
have never before imagined.

36:25.202 --> 36:27.038
I don't care.

36:27.071 --> 36:29.840
You need to start honouring
everything I've done for you,

36:29.874 --> 36:32.143
you feckless waste of skin.

36:33.544 --> 36:35.079
Dad, let go of me.

39:49.240 --> 39:52.076
I'm not saying
don't do it.

39:52.109 --> 39:53.244
Just think about it, Jack,

39:53.277 --> 39:54.479
- it's a long way away.
- From where?

39:54.513 --> 39:57.915
I don't want people just nipping
out from London at high tea

39:57.948 --> 40:00.452
to pop in on Jack Travis's new
play thing.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.186
This is a whole new level of
experience.

40:02.219 --> 40:03.687
I know what
you're trying to do.

40:03.721 --> 40:06.090
I'm sorry, I don't think you
do.

40:06.123 --> 40:07.691
People will come for days.

40:07.725 --> 40:08.893
Well, they'll have to.

40:08.926 --> 40:09.760
Days?

40:09.793 --> 40:10.961
Weeks, months.

40:10.995 --> 40:13.864
They'll quit the rat race and
build houses on the beach.

40:15.032 --> 40:16.033
Samantha?

40:17.435 --> 40:18.537
Samantha?

40:18.570 --> 40:21.338
I love your
passion, Jack, you know I do.

40:21.372 --> 40:24.909
The whole thing does add
colour to your story.

40:24.942 --> 40:26.744
Who's gonna back you?

40:28.112 --> 40:29.447
I've got backing.

40:29.481 --> 40:30.314
Really?

40:30.347 --> 40:32.950
The whole thing's coming
together.

40:32.983 --> 40:33.817
Well, I'm happy for
you,

40:33.851 --> 40:35.186
because all I'm hearing

40:35.219 --> 40:36.887
is that none of the major
players are interested.

40:36.921 --> 40:38.423
It's too off the beaten track.

40:40.525 --> 40:44.028
Aye, well, perhaps that's for
the best.

40:44.061 --> 40:45.963
What?

40:45.996 --> 40:48.466
Call me when you're back in
London.

40:53.337 --> 40:56.508
We'll show them, won't we,
Alasdair?

40:56.541 --> 40:57.975
Father and son.

41:37.382 --> 41:38.383
Hey.

41:41.118 --> 41:42.286
Pull up a seat.

41:44.054 --> 41:45.789
How's the writing
going?

41:47.891 --> 41:51.195
You know, there used to be
a whole village over there.

41:53.964 --> 41:55.467
That what you're writing
about?

41:56.200 --> 41:58.002
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

41:58.035 --> 42:00.505
On whether I can
provide disabled access.

42:02.239 --> 42:03.240
How's Bee?

42:04.609 --> 42:05.809
Bee?

42:07.211 --> 42:08.212
Bee.

42:10.147 --> 42:11.348
Let me see.

42:11.383 --> 42:13.284
You ever think maybe your
interest in darkness and evil...

42:13.317 --> 42:14.318
No.

42:19.056 --> 42:20.458
She's a teenager.

42:20.492 --> 42:21.693
She seems troubled.

42:21.726 --> 42:24.895
And she'll probably be very
successful like her father.

42:28.165 --> 42:30.000
How much do you want for it?

42:30.034 --> 42:31.101
Want for what?

42:31.135 --> 42:32.236
I can help you.

42:32.269 --> 42:34.938
You can move back to Glasgow,
get on with your lives.

42:34.972 --> 42:36.240
I don't think my great
grandmother

42:36.273 --> 42:37.107
- would approve.
- Ah,

42:37.141 --> 42:39.209
so the bungalow was hers.

42:40.911 --> 42:42.447
I take it she's no longer with
us?

42:42.480 --> 42:43.481
Oh, no, she is.

42:45.282 --> 42:47.217
She's buried in your back
garden.

43:11.543 --> 43:12.544
Bee?

45:33.116 --> 45:34.117
Tabitha.

45:42.827 --> 45:47.231
Your great grandmother was
Mackay's maid.

45:51.436 --> 45:53.103
You have no idea what you're
doing.

45:53.136 --> 45:55.239
- Tell me.
- Get away from me!

45:55.272 --> 45:57.475
What's the matter, Jenny?

46:08.620 --> 46:10.087
It's too late.

46:44.722 --> 46:47.157
Hey, hey, baby.

46:49.527 --> 46:50.628
What you writing?

46:50.662 --> 46:52.329
Right, do you remember
that time we went to Ullapool

46:52.362 --> 46:53.196
and we kept missing everything

46:53.230 --> 46:55.600
because we couldn't get out on
time?

46:55.633 --> 46:59.671
The shops, the,
remember the ferry?

46:59.704 --> 47:02.574
The whisky thing, the...

47:02.607 --> 47:03.474
Well, I'm taking that idea,
right,

47:03.508 --> 47:06.143
this couple who just can't seem
to do

47:06.176 --> 47:08.446
- that they want to do...
- You're writing a play?

47:13.484 --> 47:15.285
What if we don't sell this
place?

47:15.987 --> 47:18.590
What if we move here
permanently?

47:18.623 --> 47:21.191
Do it up, do the gardens,
everything, right?

47:21.224 --> 47:24.261
You can keep teaching,
I can start writing.

47:26.330 --> 47:27.865
Look, I know, I know it sounds
crazy.

47:27.899 --> 47:29.400
But just think, if I can get
Jack's help,

47:29.434 --> 47:31.168
his connections, then...

47:31.201 --> 47:32.269
What are you doing?

47:33.905 --> 47:35.473
What?

47:35.506 --> 47:38.241
I'm thinking about us, about our
future.

47:41.446 --> 47:42.747
I fucking hate teaching.

47:42.780 --> 47:44.816
Callum, you can't stand it
here.

47:44.849 --> 47:46.851
Yeah, but that's because I'm a
nobody.

47:46.884 --> 47:48.519
I'm what, I'm a teacher on
sabbatical

47:48.553 --> 47:50.922
trying to clean out his
grandmother in law's

47:50.955 --> 47:52.824
shitty old bungalow.

47:52.857 --> 47:55.125
It's like Damacles' sword
hanging over me.

47:56.527 --> 47:59.797
Look, I've really got
a shot here with Jack.

48:00.965 --> 48:02.700
- The guy's right there.
- No.

48:02.734 --> 48:05.637
No, I don't want you going over
there.

48:05.670 --> 48:07.170
You still haven't taken down
those sheds.

48:07.204 --> 48:09.507
What the hell is wrong with
you?

48:09.540 --> 48:11.709
I thought you wanted to move
back up here.

48:11.743 --> 48:14.311
You're not a writer, Callum.

48:14.344 --> 48:15.345
Get a grip.

48:16.279 --> 48:18.716
Can't just suddenly do this in
the middle of us trying to...

48:18.750 --> 48:19.917
Trying to what, Jenny?

48:25.556 --> 48:26.758
At least I'm trying to make
something

48:26.791 --> 48:28.393
of this awful situation.

49:16.841 --> 49:18.609
Come on.

49:18.643 --> 49:22.580
Come on, Alasdair, I know you're
in there.

49:22.613 --> 49:24.649
Talk to me, talk to me!

49:25.817 --> 49:27.350
What's the matter?

49:27.385 --> 49:29.420
Is this where Mackay put you?

49:29.454 --> 49:30.822
Where he starved you?

49:30.855 --> 49:35.626
That's what you get
when you disrespect me.

49:35.660 --> 49:39.430
I gave you everything and
you spat it back in my face!

49:39.464 --> 49:41.466
Couldn't help yourself, could
you,

49:41.499 --> 49:43.801
exposing your mother's shame!

49:54.378 --> 49:59.383
Who's that?

50:06.591 --> 50:07.592
Who's there?

50:27.512 --> 50:28.746
Who's there?

50:30.581 --> 50:31.582
Bee?

50:37.388 --> 50:39.457
Don't come in.

50:41.859 --> 50:42.860
Okay.

50:47.832 --> 50:48.933
What's the matter?

50:51.002 --> 50:52.003
Where have you been?

50:57.842 --> 51:00.044
Why don't you want me to see
you?

51:00.077 --> 51:01.879
You haven't missed
me.

51:03.047 --> 51:04.048
Yes I have.

51:04.849 --> 51:08.586
I came back to
help, but you don't want me.

51:13.424 --> 51:14.759
Help with what?

52:02.039 --> 52:05.443
Shit.

52:22.760 --> 52:24.495
Hi, Jack.

52:24.528 --> 52:28.766
Sorry, the ole' door was open.

52:39.911 --> 52:40.978
So how's it all going?

52:41.779 --> 52:44.615
Yeah, I know how that
feels.

52:44.649 --> 52:47.118
The creative process, huh?

52:47.151 --> 52:48.452
Oh, speaking of which, I was...

52:59.130 --> 53:00.064
Eh, what are we drinking to?

53:00.097 --> 53:01.933
You know why I bought
this place, Callum?

53:02.900 --> 53:06.103
No.

53:06.137 --> 53:09.473
You know what happens
when you tell people

53:10.174 --> 53:11.809
that you own a castle?

53:13.010 --> 53:15.212
No, what's that?

53:15.246 --> 53:18.482
Sex and drugs.

53:20.084 --> 53:20.785
Eh?

53:20.818 --> 53:23.087
- I'll drink to that.
- Yeah.

53:23.120 --> 53:25.523
So, what's with the papers?

53:26.590 --> 53:27.525
Ah, it's just a play.

53:27.558 --> 53:28.893
Play?

53:28.926 --> 53:30.061
Whose play, your play?

53:30.094 --> 53:31.762
Well, I mean, it's just
notes at the moment, but...

53:31.796 --> 53:33.197
Well, then perform it.

53:33.965 --> 53:35.967
Oh, no, no, no, no, it's not
finished.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.001
Oh, you must.

53:37.034 --> 53:39.937
A play is not for writing,
it's for performing.

53:39.971 --> 53:41.238
Well, couldn't I just
tell you what it's about?

53:41.272 --> 53:43.140
I don't wanna know what it's
about.

53:43.174 --> 53:47.278
I want to experience it
live in the flesh, huh?

53:47.311 --> 53:52.183
I wanna feel it like a cat
clawing up my clavicle,

53:52.216 --> 53:57.221
searing my sinews, feasting
on my festering soul.

53:57.755 --> 54:02.760
I want you to make love to my
loins with your words, Callum.

54:02.793 --> 54:06.063
Rain death down upon my
dissident psyche.

54:06.097 --> 54:10.901
Forget your notes, I want your
play

54:12.269 --> 54:13.270
inside me.

54:15.072 --> 54:17.675
Inside me the way that Jenny's
ancestors

54:17.708 --> 54:19.877
are inside this place.

54:21.345 --> 54:22.580
What?

54:22.613 --> 54:25.549
You know, her great grandmother
thrown down the stairs,

54:25.583 --> 54:26.817
used and abused.

54:26.851 --> 54:29.787
Her great uncle left
to starve in the wall.

54:37.094 --> 54:39.196
Please, Callum,
listen...

54:39.230 --> 54:40.064
You lied to me, Jenny.

54:40.097 --> 54:40.931
Please.

54:40.965 --> 54:42.533
This is some heavy shit.

54:44.035 --> 54:45.536
- You need counselling.
- Counselling?

54:46.937 --> 54:49.607
I spent my entire
childhood being counselled

54:49.640 --> 54:51.108
by everyone who had an opinion.

54:51.142 --> 54:52.243
Exactly.

54:52.276 --> 54:53.711
No wonder you can't look out the
window

54:53.744 --> 54:54.912
without freaking out.

54:54.945 --> 54:57.681
He's got no idea what he's
doing, digging up all this.

54:57.715 --> 55:00.217
There's supposed to be
a curse on that castle,

55:00.251 --> 55:01.786
a fricking curse.

55:02.753 --> 55:04.755
Your great granny was
standing in this kitchen

55:04.789 --> 55:06.090
making beef bridies

55:06.123 --> 55:09.160
while her son starved to
death inside a fucking wall?

55:13.697 --> 55:15.066
You wanted to find out if it's
all true,

55:15.099 --> 55:16.734
if he's bringing it all back.

55:16.767 --> 55:18.702
- Callum...
- Sweetheart,

55:18.736 --> 55:19.703
you need help.

55:19.737 --> 55:21.072
Callum, please.

55:22.807 --> 55:25.743
He wants people to laugh at
my great grandmother's murder.

55:28.646 --> 55:31.649
My granny, my Mum.

55:36.253 --> 55:38.923
It gets a hold of you, it won't
let go.

55:38.956 --> 55:39.924
Well, then, why did we move
here, then?

55:39.957 --> 55:43.227
Because I can't bring
a child into this world

55:43.260 --> 55:45.296
if there's still something
there.

57:37.074 --> 57:38.042
Jenny.

57:39.843 --> 57:41.845
Hello, what are you doing here?

57:43.214 --> 57:44.181
I think we should have a talk.

57:44.215 --> 57:45.517
Don't you?

57:45.550 --> 57:48.886
Uh, have a seat, make yourself
at home.

57:48.919 --> 57:50.221
Shouldn't be too hard.

57:50.254 --> 57:51.855
What's on your mind, neighbour?

57:53.290 --> 57:55.192
I need to know what you're
working on,

57:56.327 --> 57:58.762
who it's about, what happens.

57:58.796 --> 58:01.265
I'm afraid I can't
discuss that with you.

58:01.298 --> 58:02.467
Will you excuse me?

58:03.367 --> 58:04.335
We're out of coal.

58:04.368 --> 58:05.869
Leave it.

58:05.903 --> 58:09.206
I said we're out of coal.

58:15.145 --> 58:15.980
Jenny.

58:16.013 --> 58:17.014
- Callum.
- Go home.

58:17.047 --> 58:19.149
This is between me and Jack.

58:19.183 --> 58:20.217
Over my dead body it is.

58:20.251 --> 58:22.853
Oh, please, I don't
want to cause any trouble.

58:23.555 --> 58:25.557
Callum, would you be a darling

58:25.590 --> 58:27.958
and go and fetch us some more
coal?

58:27.992 --> 58:30.127
It's much more cheerier with a
fire.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.229
We're not here for a soiree,
Jack.

58:32.263 --> 58:33.264
Please!

58:34.865 --> 58:36.534
Downstairs, I insist.

58:48.178 --> 58:49.813
Might as well get cosy, yeah?

59:36.026 --> 59:37.027
Bee?

59:37.895 --> 59:42.066
So your great grandmother
was Mackay's maidservant,

59:43.200 --> 59:45.269
the illicit mother of Alasdair
Mackay,

59:45.302 --> 59:47.871
the devil's own tortured
servant of the night.

59:50.240 --> 59:52.009
I suppose you don't want
me to make anything of it,

59:52.042 --> 59:53.911
keep it in the wheelie bin.

59:53.944 --> 59:57.515
What gives you the right to
come up here, dig up my past

59:57.549 --> 1:00:01.151
and put it on display like
some gothic freak show?

1:00:01.185 --> 1:00:02.886
I wasn't aware it was buried.

1:00:02.920 --> 1:00:05.490
I'll tell you what I am
very interested to dig up

1:00:05.523 --> 1:00:10.361
is why a young woman so
traumatised by her dreadful,

1:00:11.061 --> 1:00:14.365
dreadful past would
choose to live next door

1:00:14.399 --> 1:00:17.234
to the very place where her
family were so

1:00:20.204 --> 1:00:21.205
affected?

1:00:21.806 --> 1:00:25.342
It strikes me, if anybody's
digging anything up, it's you.

1:00:26.511 --> 1:00:28.178
And what about Bee?

1:00:28.212 --> 1:00:29.880
What does she make of all this?

1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:37.121
There's your coal.

1:00:39.691 --> 1:00:41.091
Let's go, Jenny.

1:00:41.125 --> 1:00:42.226
I'm not finished.

1:00:42.259 --> 1:00:43.428
Yes you are, let's go.

1:00:43.461 --> 1:00:44.596
Callum, I'm not leaving.

1:00:44.629 --> 1:00:46.096
Jenny, we're going.

1:00:46.130 --> 1:00:47.399
Like hell we are.

1:00:48.232 --> 1:00:52.670
Look, I don't know
what's going on here, okay,

1:00:52.704 --> 1:00:55.239
but I don't like it, any of it.

1:00:57.207 --> 1:00:59.544
Whatever happened to your
family here was awful.

1:01:00.478 --> 1:01:04.716
All I know is that we need to
leave now.

1:01:04.749 --> 1:01:06.718
What is it?

1:01:06.751 --> 1:01:07.951
Oh, shit!

1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:09.521
We need to go!

1:01:20.765 --> 1:01:22.032
You wee devil.

1:01:37.582 --> 1:01:38.583
Very good, Beleth.

1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:44.354
You can come out now.

1:03:05.235 --> 1:03:06.504
Nice place.

1:03:18.248 --> 1:03:19.450
It's a little draughty.

1:03:20.818 --> 1:03:23.353
I should write a piece on this.

1:03:23.388 --> 1:03:26.791
Let me guess, feckless
playwright

1:03:26.824 --> 1:03:29.359
buys Scottish castle to bolster
career.

1:03:29.394 --> 1:03:33.631
I was thinking more tortured
artist

1:03:34.766 --> 1:03:39.637
escapes ex-wife at castle from
hell.

1:03:40.705 --> 1:03:42.306
Clearly I failed.

1:03:42.339 --> 1:03:43.608
Oh, no.

1:03:43.641 --> 1:03:46.243
You still look a little tortured
to me.

1:03:49.414 --> 1:03:51.281
Are you gonna give me the grand
tour?

1:03:52.584 --> 1:03:53.751
You shouldn't be here.

1:03:55.152 --> 1:03:56.153
I'm working.

1:03:58.456 --> 1:04:00.592
What are you working on?

1:04:01.626 --> 1:04:03.226
- A story.
- Story.

1:04:06.898 --> 1:04:08.198
Is it about me?

1:04:08.231 --> 1:04:09.567
I haven't finished it yet.

1:04:09.601 --> 1:04:11.536
You should finish it.

1:04:13.404 --> 1:04:14.371
Get out.

1:04:17.575 --> 1:04:19.309
Where is she?

1:04:19.343 --> 1:04:20.478
You can't see her.

1:04:20.511 --> 1:04:21.144
Why?

1:04:21.178 --> 1:04:22.212
What have you done with her?

1:04:22.245 --> 1:04:24.515
- What have I done with her?
- I'm Bee's mother.

1:04:24.549 --> 1:04:25.550
Her mother?

1:04:26.851 --> 1:04:28.686
Welcome home.

1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:29.921
You call this a home?

1:04:29.954 --> 1:04:31.656
Oh, no, no, no.

1:04:33.424 --> 1:04:35.627
This is more than just a home.

1:04:35.660 --> 1:04:40.665
You are full of shit, Jack
Travis.

1:05:06.691 --> 1:05:07.925
Oh, Jack.

1:06:54.599 --> 1:06:56.067
Shit.

1:06:56.100 --> 1:06:57.902
You stay there, love.

1:07:03.708 --> 1:07:04.842
What do you want, Jack?

1:07:06.878 --> 1:07:08.746
She's, she's, she's dead.

1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:09.480
What?

1:07:09.514 --> 1:07:10.715
- She's dead.
- Who's dead?

1:07:10.748 --> 1:07:11.783
- Who's dead?
- I told you,

1:07:11.816 --> 1:07:12.817
stay in the room.

1:07:15.019 --> 1:07:16.621
It's Beleth.

1:07:16.654 --> 1:07:18.623
What, Bee's dead?

1:07:18.656 --> 1:07:19.657
No.

1:07:21.125 --> 1:07:22.493
What is it, Jack?

1:07:22.527 --> 1:07:23.594
Kathryn, Kathryn...

1:07:23.628 --> 1:07:24.929
Listen to me, Jack.

1:07:24.962 --> 1:07:26.998
What the hell is going on here?

1:07:27.031 --> 1:07:28.666
Kathryn, Kathryn.

1:07:28.699 --> 1:07:30.835
- Who, who's dead?
- Kathryn!

1:07:30.868 --> 1:07:32.904
She shouldn't even be here,
she should be in London.

1:07:32.937 --> 1:07:33.838
I don't...

1:07:33.871 --> 1:07:34.772
Where is she?

1:07:34.806 --> 1:07:35.840
Where is she, Jack?

1:07:36.741 --> 1:07:37.775
Jack, where is she now?

1:07:37.809 --> 1:07:40.611
The stairs, the stairs,
the bottom of the stairs.

1:07:40.645 --> 1:07:42.747
- We're coming over.
- I'm getting my coat.

1:08:27.992 --> 1:08:28.993
Wait.

1:09:17.675 --> 1:09:18.676
She's gone.

1:09:20.244 --> 1:09:21.612
Doesn't make any sense.

1:09:21.646 --> 1:09:23.514
Makes perfect sense.

1:09:23.547 --> 1:09:25.950
Bee, Bee.

1:09:30.755 --> 1:09:32.990
- Wait, hey...
- Let go of me.

1:09:33.024 --> 1:09:34.425
Hey!

1:09:36.027 --> 1:09:37.762
Where's Bee?

1:09:37.795 --> 1:09:39.163
She's not here.

1:09:39.196 --> 1:09:41.732
What do you mean, she's not
here?

1:09:42.733 --> 1:09:45.469
Something is happening.

1:09:45.503 --> 1:09:46.771
Damn right it is.

1:09:46.804 --> 1:09:49.106
Something wonderful.

1:09:49.140 --> 1:09:51.475
Where's Bee, Jack?

1:09:51.509 --> 1:09:53.511
I'll tell you exactly what's
happening.

1:09:53.544 --> 1:09:54.545
Someone's losing his frigging
mind.

1:09:54.578 --> 1:09:55.813
It's not like that.

1:09:55.846 --> 1:09:57.515
No?

1:09:57.548 --> 1:09:59.717
Well, then where's your
ex wife's dead body?

1:10:01.552 --> 1:10:04.989
Jack, where's Bee?

1:10:06.958 --> 1:10:07.959
I don't know.

1:10:09.827 --> 1:10:11.162
How long has she been missing?

1:10:12.263 --> 1:10:16.534
Goodness sake, Jack, open your
eyes.

1:10:18.235 --> 1:10:21.605
Look at what's happening to you.

1:10:21.639 --> 1:10:26.644
You have to stop this.

1:11:53.364 --> 1:11:55.599
I helped you finish
your play.

1:11:59.203 --> 1:12:00.738
Everyone was scared.

1:12:03.741 --> 1:12:05.076
Yes, they were.

1:12:07.812 --> 1:12:10.314
How are you doing all of this?

1:12:22.660 --> 1:12:23.694
Beleth?

1:12:28.065 --> 1:12:29.800
No one will come, you
know.

1:12:30.734 --> 1:12:31.735
Come where?

1:12:33.037 --> 1:12:34.338
To the living play.

1:12:37.108 --> 1:12:38.642
Why do you say that?

1:12:38.676 --> 1:12:40.744
We need to start
again

1:12:40.778 --> 1:12:42.346
so people will be scared for
real.

1:12:45.383 --> 1:12:48.018
Why can't you come back,

1:12:50.721 --> 1:12:52.022
huh, as you were?

1:12:56.927 --> 1:12:58.095
We'll do it together.

1:13:01.765 --> 1:13:03.801
We are doing this together.

1:13:38.235 --> 1:13:39.236
Hi, girls.

1:13:40.037 --> 1:13:41.105
Hi.

1:13:41.138 --> 1:13:42.840
Where are you off to?

1:13:42.873 --> 1:13:43.941
Seeing a friend.

1:13:43.974 --> 1:13:46.744
- Sorry, who are you?
- Are you friends with Bee?

1:13:46.777 --> 1:13:49.213
Um, depends what you mean by
friends.

1:13:49.246 --> 1:13:50.080
She's in our class.

1:13:50.114 --> 1:13:51.348
Have you heard from her?

1:13:52.417 --> 1:13:54.285
We're not her frigging
secretary.

1:13:54.318 --> 1:13:55.152
Bee's weird like that,

1:13:55.186 --> 1:13:57.321
she'll just drop off the radar
for days

1:13:57.354 --> 1:13:58.722
and then show up when she wants.

1:13:58.756 --> 1:14:00.291
When did you last see her?

1:14:00.324 --> 1:14:01.325
When we had a sleepover.

1:14:01.358 --> 1:14:02.760
Did something happen?

1:14:02.793 --> 1:14:04.094
No.

1:14:04.128 --> 1:14:05.129
Come on.

1:14:09.166 --> 1:14:10.167
Is Bee missing?

1:14:10.834 --> 1:14:12.269
Just tell me what happened.

1:14:12.303 --> 1:14:13.837
Come on, Katie.

1:14:13.871 --> 1:14:14.506
Nice to meet you.

1:14:14.539 --> 1:14:15.739
No, please.

1:14:16.807 --> 1:14:18.209
Did something bad happen?

1:14:19.843 --> 1:14:21.312
Something at the wall?

1:14:24.315 --> 1:14:25.316
She screamed.

1:14:27.218 --> 1:14:29.787
When she touched the wall, she
screamed.

1:14:32.156 --> 1:14:33.491
You need to go home.

1:14:33.525 --> 1:14:34.925
- What?
- Now.

1:14:34.959 --> 1:14:36.126
You need to leave, go on!

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:38.862
- What the fuck?
- Let's just go.

1:14:40.164 --> 1:14:41.131
Callum!

1:14:49.441 --> 1:14:50.442
Callum!

1:15:19.571 --> 1:15:20.971
What do you want, Jack?

1:15:24.241 --> 1:15:25.809
What do I want?

1:15:30.047 --> 1:15:31.549
I want to be left alone

1:15:32.883 --> 1:15:35.553
to do whatever the fuck I want.

1:15:37.087 --> 1:15:39.923
You peasants

1:15:41.091 --> 1:15:44.462
coming in here like you've
something important to say.

1:15:48.566 --> 1:15:50.067
What do you want?

1:15:52.169 --> 1:15:55.973
I want you to calm down and
listen to what I'm saying.

1:15:57.107 --> 1:15:59.243
You being here is a problem for
me.

1:16:02.547 --> 1:16:07.552
Callum, I thought we were
gonna work together.

1:16:09.119 --> 1:16:12.022
You and me?

1:16:12.056 --> 1:16:16.193
Look, we can't have all this
heavy shit

1:16:16.226 --> 1:16:18.630
being paraded on our doorstep.

1:16:18.663 --> 1:16:20.297
Jenny's fragile.

1:16:27.204 --> 1:16:29.106
She needs to let go of all this.

1:16:31.676 --> 1:16:34.278
It's not right for her to
carry that sort of pain.

1:16:38.248 --> 1:16:39.983
Jack, there's no shame in it.

1:16:40.017 --> 1:16:41.051
You can work on something else,

1:16:41.085 --> 1:16:44.355
something people will
actually want to remember.

1:16:52.930 --> 1:16:55.065
Jack, are you hearing what I'm
saying?

1:16:57.034 --> 1:17:02.039
This has to end.

1:17:32.537 --> 1:17:33.671
Jenny.

1:17:38.410 --> 1:17:40.010
Jack!

1:17:40.043 --> 1:17:42.514
Jack let me out of here now!

1:18:29.594 --> 1:18:31.161
Get out of here.

1:19:17.809 --> 1:19:22.747
You let me out
of here now!

1:19:32.356 --> 1:19:35.827
Ah!

1:19:55.713 --> 1:19:59.551
Everything we've
worked for.

1:19:59.584 --> 1:20:01.553
I never wanted this.

1:20:01.586 --> 1:20:03.454
You never wanted me.

1:20:05.857 --> 1:20:07.725
What are you?

1:20:44.696 --> 1:20:46.497
Tell me what you are!

1:20:47.432 --> 1:20:48.766
You created me.

1:21:19.931 --> 1:21:22.132
You are not my daughter!

1:22:29.400 --> 1:22:34.405
Bee.

1:22:47.618 --> 1:22:48.619
Jenny.

1:22:57.294 --> 1:22:58.295
Oh.

1:23:07.805 --> 1:23:08.840
Bee, wake up.

1:23:11.374 --> 1:23:12.977
Bee, can you hear me?

1:23:35.066 --> 1:23:37.300
Bee, Bee, oh, Bee!

1:23:38.803 --> 1:23:41.338
Shh, you're okay.
