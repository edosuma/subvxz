 I might come home for a visit.

    Just to say hi. So, you
    know, pick up the phone.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.446

  thing one more time I swear

04:07.448 --> 04:09.281
       I will cut it off
       with a power saw.

09:12.553 --> 09:14.586
     would this news fall?

12:44.131 --> 12:49.200
     The award for the most
   disturbing costume goes to

12:50.203 --> 12:53.171
          Zoe Balicki
who decided to come as a pilgrim

12:53.173 --> 12:57.275
         who has been..

12:57.277 --> 12:59.410
            scalped.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.480
        -quiet applause-

13:07.821 --> 13:11.156
            -crying-

13:11.158 --> 13:13.925
        Zoe, we have to
    applaud your creativity.

13:13.927 --> 13:17.362
        However, a quick
  reminder for Zoe's parents:

13:17.364 --> 13:20.365
 including, ah, raw meat on an

13:20.367 --> 13:26.104
  elementary school costume is
not considered strictly sanitary

13:26.106 --> 13:27.872
        And now, if the
    children will join me in

13:27.874 --> 13:29.941

13:36.149 --> 13:39.150
        I didn't finish
      telling you my news.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.820
    I'm sorry, there's more?

13:42.856 --> 13:47.425
     I invited my fiancée's
    family over for dinner.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.094
    I want you to meet her.

13:51.998 --> 13:55.300
     Beg your pardon. Her?

13:55.302 --> 13:58.369
      I'm a lesbian, Dad.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.370

13:59.372 --> 14:01.606
         I'm a lesbian!

      So, this is how you

14:17.190 --> 14:20.091
        choose to share
 important news with the family

14:20.093 --> 14:23.294
       Just dumping it on
      us out of the blue.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.130
 Believe me, coming out in the
 middle of a grade school play

14:26.132 --> 14:29.334
    was not my ideal way of
coming out of the closet either.

14:29.336 --> 14:32.136
     Well, couldn't we have
 had a more gradual transition?

14:32.138 --> 14:34.539
      I mean, last I knew,
      you had a boyfriend.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.041

       Yeah, isn't there
    supposed to be some like

14:37.043 --> 14:40.345
      I don't know, sexual
     experimentation first?

14:40.347 --> 14:41.346
        There has been.

            Oh God.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.048
          Come on Dad,
    when's the last time you

14:44.050 --> 14:45.884
  actually saw me with a man?

14:45.886 --> 14:48.953
  There was that guy you went
 to the Fire & Ice dance with.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.124
       Was that a woman?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.892
        No Uncle Oscar,
     that was Bobby Milton

14:53.894 --> 14:56.060

      Well we re so sorry
     to offend you, Zilla.

 We really apologize that your
family's been too insensitive to

15:08.541 --> 15:11.609
    notice, possibly because
    you've always dated men.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.345
  I knew you wouldn't approve.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.381
        It's not that I
       disapprove, honey.

15:16.383 --> 15:20.451
       It's just... well,
     it's all very sudden.

           AUNT MARGE
    Sal told me everything.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.590
I brought you some chicken soup.

       You do understand
     that this is not like

15:30.463 --> 15:33.264
   a contagious disease that
can be treated with soup, right?

15:33.266 --> 15:36.167
         And I brought
     some dresses for Zoe.

 sensation at the school play.

      You should remarry.

      million times, Marge

16:04.397 --> 16:06.197
 I haven't met the right woman.

    If we show the werewolf
    coming out of the coffin

20:54.954 --> 20:58.022

      and with artificial
    insemination these days

25:45.645 --> 25:47.311
   that's entirely possible.

25:47.313 --> 25:52.316
 I think Zilla wants to finish
  college before she has kids.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.985
        Well, naturally!

25:54.987 --> 25:57.721
         But she won't
     want to wait too long.

25:57.723 --> 26:01.125
 I waited until I was older to
have children and quite frankly

26:01.127 --> 26:04.194
       I think something
    went wrong with my eggs.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.166
           -whisper-
   They re practically mutes.

26:11.704 --> 26:14.071
            GEOFFREY
    So you re a gay couple?

26:14.073 --> 26:17.074
             OSCAR
            Um, no.

26:17.076 --> 26:21.345
      Mm mm, no no, we re
    not any kind of couple.

26:21.347 --> 26:24.648
        That would be an
    incestuous relationship.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.050
        We re brothers.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.818
            GEOFFREY
              Hmm.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.921
You come off like a gay couple.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.590
              CORA
             Anyway

26:32.592 --> 26:35.859
     Have you thought about
what kind of ceremony you want?

26:35.861 --> 26:39.063
    Well, I think we'd like
      something very small

26:39.065 --> 26:42.166
   and informal... with just
 a few of our closest friends.

26:42.168 --> 26:46.236
     Oh. Well that wouldn't
   be very festive, would it?

26:47.940 --> 26:52.810
       Don't be afraid to
 splurge a little, sweetheart.

26:52.812 --> 26:57.281
  Geoffrey and I have decided
  we want to cover everything.

26:57.283 --> 27:01.151
       We re delighted to
     do it, aren't we dear?

27:02.788 --> 27:04.822
    Well now, wait a minute.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.224
      Why should you pay?

27:07.226 --> 27:10.127
     Well, it's traditional
     for the bride's family

27:10.129 --> 27:12.096
       to cover expenses.

27:12.098 --> 27:16.367
         Yes, but there
      are two brides here.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.937
Well I just thought that because

27:19.939 --> 27:23.140
          we re really
     extremely supportive-

27:23.142 --> 27:25.809
        Now hey, I don't
    think that's very fair.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.411
  Sal was a little taken aback

27:27.413 --> 27:29.113
      when Zilla said she
     wanted to get married

27:29.115 --> 27:30.781
    because she's so young.

27:30.783 --> 27:33.250
       That doesn't mean
      he's not supportive.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.119
     He's very supportive.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.187
            Are you?

27:39.392 --> 27:41.742
              Yes.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.093
    Sal has raised these two
  little girls all on his own

27:44.096 --> 27:47.831
and yes, he gets a little surly
 sometimes, don't get me wrong.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.067
  He has a lot of weaknesses.

27:50.069 --> 27:54.304
Frankly, he's terrifying if you
wake him up early in the morning

27:54.306 --> 27:57.708
 and if you spill just a little
    bit of furniture varnish

27:57.710 --> 28:00.444
    in the laundry machine..

28:00.446 --> 28:01.912
           watch out.

28:01.914 --> 28:02.813
           He's also-

28:02.815 --> 28:05.816
      Ahem, thanks Oscar.

28:05.818 --> 28:11.021
         But overall he
      is a very good guy.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.824
     And so if you want to
    have this competition of

28:13.826 --> 28:16.827
who's the most supportive parent

28:16.829 --> 28:20.230
    I would like to nominate
Sal as a very strong contender.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.206
       I'm not competing.

28:29.208 --> 28:34.078
      We would be happy to
  host Lu and Zilla's wedding.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.815
    And we ll do everything
   we can to make it special.

28:37.817 --> 28:42.853
      Well if we host the
   wedding, we ll go all out.

28:43.155 --> 28:47.958
       Couldn't you both
       host the wedding?

28:47.960 --> 28:50.027
            Jointly?

28:50.429 --> 28:55.833
          I suppose we
      could consider that.

28:55.835 --> 28:59.803
      This is going to be
     the best wedding since

28:59.805 --> 29:02.172
         Prince William
      and Kate Middleton!

29:02.174 --> 29:03.173
       But we don't want-

29:03.175 --> 29:04.842
   Now nonsense, sweetheart.

29:04.844 --> 29:08.112
       Everyone says they
    don't want a big wedding

29:08.114 --> 29:10.981
        but I know it's
      every girl's dream.

29:10.983 --> 29:16.053
 And I know it's hard to plan a
  wedding without your mother.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.456
        But I've always
    wanted another daughter

29:19.458 --> 29:23.260
and it doesn't look like I ll be
acquiring one via these buffoons

29:23.262 --> 29:26.430
         any time soon.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.999
         I'd be honored

29:29.001 --> 29:31.468

      of me in that role.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.023
 You know those severed fingers
I was marinating in the fridge?

32:40.025 --> 32:42.042
             Yeah.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.060
     Well, Lu's mother came
 downstairs dressed as a ghoul.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.963
         Why would she
     be dressed as a ghoul?

   I don't know, but she was.

32:47.566 --> 32:51.501
          And she saw
   the fingers and screamed.

   we can make a horror film

38:39.851 --> 38:41.651
          Nice dress.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.553
          I'd keep the
    comments about the dress

38:43.555 --> 38:46.022
  to a minimum if I were you.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.566
       Okay. The werewolf
 just climbed out of his coffin

38:56.568 --> 38:59.069
       and he's wandering
      around town lonely.

38:59.071 --> 39:01.438
       He wants friends.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.806
But no one will be friends with
  him because he's a monster.

39:03.809 --> 39:07.744
The only way he can make friends
is if they become monsters too.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.412
   So he has to bite someone.

39:09.414 --> 39:12.916
            Action.

39:12.918 --> 39:16.486
     Now that is adorable.

39:16.488 --> 39:20.590
  Oh, and what about this one?

39:20.592 --> 39:23.526
           SALES LADY
    Would you like to try a
   mother-of-the-bride dress?

39:23.528 --> 39:26.730
   Ooh, that would be lovely!

39:32.671 --> 39:34.704
         I don't know,
      it's kind of dumpy.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.905
 I don't feel like any of these

39:35.907 --> 39:43.079
       really capture my
       true personality.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.482
   You have to get higher up.

40:04.569 --> 40:07.637
         But this would
      look lovely on you!

40:07.639 --> 40:10.473
         Mom, you know
     I don't wear dresses.

40:10.475 --> 40:12.976
       You don't normally
     get married either Lu

40:12.978 --> 40:15.578
      but I was hoping you
    could make an exception

40:15.580 --> 40:18.448
          for the most
  elaborate day of your life.

40:18.450 --> 40:20.550
          Now darling

40:20.552 --> 40:24.721
        this would look
  absolutely fabulous on you.

40:28.660 --> 40:32.962
     Doesn't it just leave
    you at a loss for words?

40:32.964 --> 40:34.030
              Yes.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.800
        Now this is me.

40:36.802 --> 40:39.903
           Excuse me,
but that is out of the question.

40:39.905 --> 40:43.173
       We are planning a
  classic, black tie wedding.

40:43.175 --> 40:44.207
        Oh, in Portland?

40:44.209 --> 40:46.776
I don't think I own a black tie.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.546
    Well, it's your niece's
    wedding.You can buy one.

40:49.548 --> 40:52.115
      If Pat gets to wear
   that, I want to wear this.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.516
 Picture it with combat boots.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.118
        Absolutely not.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.187
  What we re going to need for
 her is something with sleeves.

40:57.189 --> 40:58.955
           Excuse me

40:58.956 --> 41:00.722
but I feel like my accouterment
  preferences are not being..

41:00.725 --> 41:02.742
           respected?

41:02.743 --> 41:04.760
   I mean, I'm wearing pants.
   Why can't he wear a dress?

41:04.763 --> 41:08.531
      How come she gets to
    wear pants and I don't?

41:08.533 --> 41:12.035
  Hey. You re at a here, and I
   need to see you at a here.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.736
  I'd also be willing to wear
        the blue taffeta

41:13.738 --> 41:15.138
       with rhinestones.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.539
         Maybe everyone
     should wear all black.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.842
       Ordinarily I think
  rhinestones are super tacky

41:18.844 --> 41:20.677
     but this is a wedding,
    and we have to sparkle.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.145
     Who are you, Liberace?

41:22.147 --> 41:24.481
      I just want everyone
     to feel comfortable..

41:24.483 --> 41:27.317
     Comfortable? In that?

41:27.318 --> 41:30.152
   Hey, I saw this exact same
look in the June issue of Vogue.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.821
      On a man or a woman?

41:31.823 --> 41:33.256
           I told you
     we should have eloped.

41:33.258 --> 41:34.991
  I volunteer to wear a tuxedo

41:34.993 --> 41:36.893
      to balance out Pat's
    slutty barmaid costume.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.862
       It's not a slutty
        barmaid costume

41:38.864 --> 41:40.063
          it's a gown!

41:40.065 --> 41:42.499
   I am not wearing a dress!

41:42.501 --> 41:47.504
    This is not just choose
   your favorite gender day!

41:47.506 --> 41:49.873

           SALES LADY
The ones in the shipping closet?

41:56.248 --> 41:58.882
     I sent them out on the
delivery truck half an hour ago.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.984
       I didn't hang them
    in the shipping closet.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.919
         I hung them in
      the dressing rooms.

42:02.921 --> 42:04.954
     Those were not gowns.

42:04.956 --> 42:07.590
 Those were everyone's clothes!

42:07.592 --> 42:09.025
            Action!

   without getting arrested?

43:26.972 --> 43:30.807

    about a wedding, right?

46:08.967 --> 46:11.801
       We re only allowed
    to shoot wedding stuff.

46:11.803 --> 46:14.504
   So the werewolf goes into
  this wedding shop trying to

46:14.506 --> 46:17.940
        bite people and
 he looks up and sees a bride.

46:17.942 --> 46:21.444
     And he falls in love.

46:21.446 --> 46:23.246
         I don't know..

46:23.247 --> 46:25.047
        Falling in love
isn't as cool as biting people.

46:25.049 --> 46:28.017
       Francis, of course
   he's going to bite people

46:28.019 --> 46:29.986
 but there's got to be a plot.

46:29.988 --> 46:33.055
     We can't be too picky,
 the deadline's in three weeks.

46:33.057 --> 46:35.525
   I don't see why they have
  to get married in a church.

46:35.527 --> 46:38.828
 I've always dreamed of seeing
my daughter married in a church.

46:38.830 --> 46:41.197
            Besides,
 weddings should be religious.

46:41.199 --> 46:42.532
         We re Jewish.

46:42.534 --> 46:44.200
        Non-practicing.

46:44.202 --> 46:46.586
             Fine.

46:46.587 --> 46:48.971
So find a rabbi who's willing to
  perform a same-sex marriage

46:48.973 --> 46:51.507
    for non-practicing Jews,
    and he can be there too.

46:51.509 --> 46:53.976
  I found the perfect church.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.511
  They re non-denominational,

46:55.513 --> 46:58.581
 and they simply love the gays.

47:00.985 --> 47:02.485
      Why is Francis here?

47:02.487 --> 47:04.954
  Why is Francis always here?

47:04.956 --> 47:07.056
      Francis, why are you
      wearing this thing?

47:07.058 --> 47:08.391
  I thought you were allergic.

47:08.393 --> 47:10.193
   I have to practice, Mr. B.

47:10.195 --> 47:11.928
     Well if you re coming
     to the church with us

47:11.930 --> 47:13.462
          you need to
  at least take the mask off.

47:13.464 --> 47:16.032
     It's not appropriate.

47:18.536 --> 47:21.237
     Yeah, put it back on.

47:21.239 --> 47:23.973
    I think it's fair to say
   Mom won yesterday's brawl.

47:23.975 --> 47:26.576
         Matt, honestly
       it wasn't a brawl.

47:26.578 --> 47:29.078
        It was a simple
       miscommunication.

47:29.080 --> 47:32.081
    I couldn't help noticing
   that I was being strangled

47:32.083 --> 47:34.016
   so I reacted defensively.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.885
   All's well that ends well.

47:35.887 --> 47:38.454
  You consider doing jail time
      ending well, do you?

47:38.456 --> 47:40.890
 Well, we got what we came for.

47:40.892 --> 47:43.993
  The dresses were purchased,
 you could say we broke them in

47:43.995 --> 47:47.096
         and Zilla and
     Zoe will look lovely.

47:47.098 --> 47:49.031
    As for the bridesmaids.

47:49.033 --> 47:52.168
  I simply plan not to look at
that half of the wedding photos.

47:52.170 --> 47:55.238
Where is Zilla? It's time to go.

47:58.076 --> 47:59.942
           You know..

47:59.944 --> 48:01.510
   this dress we picked out..

48:01.512 --> 48:04.080
   It's not really my style.

48:04.082 --> 48:05.648
        I know it's not.

48:05.650 --> 48:09.285
        I thought it was
  some secret inner girliness

48:09.287 --> 48:11.921
           coming out
     after all these years.

48:11.923 --> 48:16.926
         No, it's just-
   Your mom really liked it.

48:16.928 --> 48:20.062
       It's our wedding.
If you don't like it, return it.

48:20.064 --> 48:22.531
        I don't want to
  hurt your mother's feelings.

48:23.101 --> 48:25.668
     Well, if you care more
 about what other people think

48:25.670 --> 48:28.938
         than being who
     you are, then wear it.

48:33.111 --> 48:36.379
I don't get it, Zill. Either you
wear the dress or you return it.

48:36.381 --> 48:39.448
         Those are your
    only two options, right?

48:39.450 --> 48:41.517
             Right.

48:42.186 --> 48:45.254
    So what's the big deal?

48:50.461 --> 48:53.412
         What is this?

48:53.413 --> 48:56.364
   Oh, it's Portland. People
like to let each other go first.

48:56.367 --> 48:57.400
             DRIVER
         You go first.

48:57.402 --> 49:00.436

       No, you go first..

49:00.438 --> 49:03.239
     No, no, you go first.

49:04.676 --> 49:05.675

         You go first.

49:05.677 --> 49:06.709

         You go first!

49:06.711 --> 49:08.945
             DRIVER
            I won't!

49:12.016 --> 49:15.351
         Well! You are
   going to love this church.

49:15.353 --> 49:17.620
   It is absolutely charming.

49:17.622 --> 49:20.990
   I'm not really sure about
 getting married in a church..

49:20.992 --> 49:23.359
       I always imagined
      an outdoor wedding.

49:23.361 --> 49:25.361
         Well they have
      very large windows.

49:25.363 --> 49:28.564
        So that's almost
      like being outside.

49:28.566 --> 49:32.034
        So, the werewolf
 falls in love with the bride.

49:32.036 --> 49:34.470
     What would he do next?

49:34.472 --> 49:38.174
 Would he maybe eat something?

49:38.176 --> 49:40.209
   No, that's not what people
    do when they re in love.

49:40.211 --> 49:42.611
 They recite poetry and stuff.

49:42.613 --> 49:44.413
         But you re not
      ready to do that yet

49:44.415 --> 49:46.082
  because you have a problem:

49:46.084 --> 49:48.651
      the bride's in love
       with someone else.

49:48.653 --> 49:51.020
         So here's your
     mission in the church:

49:51.022 --> 49:53.155
  make Zilla break up with Lu

49:53.157 --> 49:56.559
          and fall in
     love with you instead.

50:00.498 --> 50:01.998
          It is nice.

inside an actual church before.

50:56.154 --> 50:57.586

50:59.724 --> 51:02.525
      I ll make the toast!

51:02.527 --> 51:04.527
        To Zilla and Lu.

51:04.529 --> 51:06.328
     I hope your daughters
       aren't dirty sluts

51:06.330 --> 51:09.131
  like we were in high school.

51:09.133 --> 51:12.201
  That's the Blood of Christ.

51:16.441 --> 51:20.476
  Yeah, that's very nice, Zoe.

51:20.478 --> 51:23.446
 Now the first step to getting
 married at the Church of Peace

51:23.448 --> 51:25.681
     is to do an interview
  of the significant parties.

51:25.683 --> 51:29.418
 So if the significant parties
  could step right this way..

51:29.420 --> 51:32.121
     We re all significant.

51:32.123 --> 51:34.824
  Okay, we ll get more chairs.

51:34.826 --> 51:37.426
         Alright, make
  Zilla fall in love with you.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.462
            Action.

51:45.236 --> 51:46.802
      Is there a problem?

51:46.804 --> 51:49.105
       How do you make a
  girl fall in love with you?

51:49.107 --> 51:52.174
 I don't know. You ll probably
 have to kiss her or something.

51:54.345 --> 51:56.229
          So tell me.

51:56.230 --> 51:58.114
   What makes you want to get
 married at the Church of Peace

51:58.116 --> 52:01.183
Well, the building is charming.

52:01.185 --> 52:03.419
     I mean it's precious.

52:03.421 --> 52:05.421
           And also,
    you re Christian, right?

52:05.423 --> 52:07.123
        Well, of course!

52:07.125 --> 52:10.292
And when was the last time each
of you actually went to church?

52:10.294 --> 52:14.730
     Ah well, that would be
   at my godson's baptism in

52:14.732 --> 52:17.299
          um.. oh, um-

52:17.301 --> 52:19.368
             1987?

52:20.505 --> 52:22.204
 It was more recent than that.

52:22.206 --> 52:24.740
    And I'm sure there have
 been several times in between.

52:24.742 --> 52:27.526
      And the rest of you?

52:27.527 --> 52:30.311
     I guess that would be
   my marriage to my ex-wife.

52:30.314 --> 52:33.382
  Which was sixteen years ago.

52:33.384 --> 52:35.184
      My father's funeral.

52:35.186 --> 52:37.203
        Which is ironic

52:37.204 --> 52:39.221
  because that son-of-a-bitch
 is almost definitely in hell.

52:39.223 --> 52:41.857
          I'm Jewish.

52:41.859 --> 52:43.626
            FRANCIS
     I can't just kiss her.

52:43.628 --> 52:47.530
      Besides, my werewolf
   nose will get in the way.

52:47.532 --> 52:50.199
      Give her a hug then.

52:50.201 --> 52:54.603
     Maybe we ll just skip
  along to the next question.

52:54.605 --> 52:58.340
       Do you believe in
    God the Father Almighty

52:58.342 --> 53:01.577
       who sacrificed his
       only begotten Son

53:01.579 --> 53:03.245
   to save us from our sins?

53:03.247 --> 53:04.246
         GEOFFREY: No.

53:04.248 --> 53:05.247
            LU: Dad.

53:05.249 --> 53:07.583
     What? I'm an atheist.

53:07.585 --> 53:10.653
        Me too! We have
       so much in common.

53:15.259 --> 53:17.726
      Um, thanks Francis.

53:24.635 --> 53:27.469
 I don't think she went for it.

53:27.471 --> 53:30.673
          That was my
       best possible hug.

53:30.675 --> 53:32.908
       Well, try to take
   things to the next level.

53:32.910 --> 53:33.976
             OSCAR
           I'm a Jew

53:33.978 --> 53:35.678
  who converted to Catholicism

53:35.680 --> 53:38.647
      to marry my ex-wife
       then got divorced

53:38.649 --> 53:41.750
 which completely goes against
   the rules of Catholicism.

53:41.752 --> 53:44.820
       So I'm not really
      sure what I am now.

53:44.822 --> 53:46.655
      I'm a neo-Mennonite.

53:46.657 --> 53:48.390
           Excuse me?

53:48.392 --> 53:50.459
             Wicca.

53:52.763 --> 53:55.397
         Okay well, um

53:55.399 --> 53:58.334
    what really matters here
  is what the brides believe.

53:58.336 --> 54:00.236
       So, Lu and Zilla?

54:00.238 --> 54:02.404
        I would describe
      myself as Christian.

54:02.406 --> 54:03.539
           You would?

54:03.541 --> 54:05.307
             Yeah.

54:05.309 --> 54:07.376
          Oh. Well...

54:07.378 --> 54:09.778
     I guess I'm not really
    sure what I believe in.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.981
  I mean, it seems to me like

54:11.983 --> 54:15.284
    a lot of religions could
     be on the right track.

54:15.286 --> 54:17.920
But I do believe in spirituality
   and being nice to people-

54:17.922 --> 54:20.990
 Francis, get the hell off me..

54:26.697 --> 54:30.532
     I don't usually swear.

54:30.534 --> 54:32.501
       That was pathetic.

54:32.503 --> 54:35.504
  Obviously, she's a lesbian.

54:35.506 --> 54:36.705
           PASTOR BOB
         Next question:

54:36.707 --> 54:40.009
Um, if you were to have children

54:40.011 --> 54:42.778
        would you raise
  them in the Christian faith?

54:42.780 --> 54:44.947
           We haven't
     really discussed that.

54:44.949 --> 54:46.782
    What have you discussed?

54:46.784 --> 54:48.751
         You don't even
   know what religion she is.

54:48.753 --> 54:50.753
        We've discussed
    that we love each other.

54:50.755 --> 54:52.855
       So you re divorced

54:52.857 --> 54:56.592
    your sister is divorced,
    your brother is divorced

54:56.594 --> 54:58.661
and your parents were divorced?

54:58.663 --> 55:00.813
             Yeah.

55:00.814 --> 55:02.964
     Basically everyone in
    my family gets divorced.

55:02.967 --> 55:04.366
          DELIVERY MAN
        Hey, Pastor Bob?

55:04.368 --> 55:05.901
         Delivery from
      Stump Town Funeral?

55:05.903 --> 55:08.871
     Oh, yes. If you could
   just put it by the organ.

55:08.873 --> 55:10.973
    One of our parishioners
        passed this week

55:10.975 --> 55:13.942
  so the family asked if they
 could deliver the casket here.

55:13.944 --> 55:16.512
         It's made from
  Oregon pine and Eco-friendly

55:16.514 --> 55:18.347
      pesticide-free glue.

55:18.349 --> 55:19.682
            GEOFFREY
           Oh, good.

55:19.684 --> 55:22.084
     Because I'd hate to be
    poisoned with pesticide

55:22.086 --> 55:25.587
 on top of already being dead.

55:25.589 --> 55:27.956
Look, can we move things along?

55:27.958 --> 55:30.359
           Evidently,
 I have to go pick up the wine

55:30.361 --> 55:33.429
    and I need to take these
 three little faggots with me..

55:36.701 --> 55:38.434
         Oh, I'm sorry.

55:38.436 --> 55:42.504
     Is that word no longer
 PC because of this situation?

55:44.742 --> 55:47.643
       It- it was never..

55:47.645 --> 55:52.081
  Oh, please don't touch that!
 That's someone else's coffin.

55:52.083 --> 55:55.784
             Well.
  To return to the interview..

55:55.786 --> 55:58.487
       Do you follow the
       Ten Commandments?

55:58.489 --> 55:59.988
 What exactly are those again?

55:59.990 --> 56:01.890
            You know

56:01.891 --> 56:03.791
    thou shalt not lie, thou
 shalt not break the Sabbath..

56:03.794 --> 56:08.497
 I sometimes break the Sabbath

56:08.499 --> 56:11.133
          even though
    I'm disputably Catholic.

56:11.135 --> 56:12.634
              How?

56:12.636 --> 56:14.370
         Well you know

56:14.372 --> 56:16.038
        if I need money?

56:16.040 --> 56:18.674
   Sometimes I just take it.

56:18.676 --> 56:20.476
           From whom?

56:20.478 --> 56:22.444
  Usually from my mom's purse.

56:22.446 --> 56:24.580
      You steal from Mom?

56:24.582 --> 56:27.015
  She would give me the money
         if I asked her

56:27.017 --> 56:29.017
      but she can't hear!

56:29.019 --> 56:30.903
         Hurry, get in

56:30.904 --> 56:32.788
     and we can reshoot the
coffin scene before anyone sees.

56:32.790 --> 56:33.989
         Are you sure?

56:33.991 --> 56:36.392
           Of course.
    Nobody else is using it.

56:36.394 --> 56:39.595
         So what you re
       saying is that you

56:39.597 --> 56:41.797
       do sometimes steal

56:41.799 --> 56:44.466
           from your
     mother on the Sabbath.

56:49.607 --> 56:50.506
              Yes.

56:50.508 --> 56:51.640
           You idiot!

56:51.642 --> 56:52.908
            GEOFFREY
          Okay, look.

56:52.910 --> 56:55.978
    Let's cut to the chase.
     How much do you want?

56:56.747 --> 56:58.814
           Excuse me?

56:58.815 --> 57:00.882
   What does a normal family
    pay to get married here?

57:00.885 --> 57:02.951
        We ll double it.

57:17.668 --> 57:21.069
         You.. can't..

57:21.071 --> 57:25.641
       get married here..

57:25.643 --> 57:28.710
           Mm mm. No.

57:36.120 --> 57:38.086
 Isn't it a little un-Christian

57:38.088 --> 57:41.623
    to ban an entire family
     from going to church?

57:41.625 --> 57:43.892
     Unwelcoming, I think.

57:43.894 --> 57:46.662
        I mean as far as
       they re concerned

57:46.664 --> 57:49.832
            they are
    dooming us all to Hell..

57:52.770 --> 57:56.004
  Zoe, I was being figurative.

57:56.006 --> 57:57.539
    Guys. I need your help.

57:57.541 --> 57:59.575
        I didn't get any
      good footage today.

57:59.577 --> 58:01.944
     Will you put on these
 masks and do a monster dance?

58:01.946 --> 58:04.713
       It's really easy.
   Francis choreographed it.

58:04.715 --> 58:06.248
              CORA
    What I don't understand

58:06.250 --> 58:10.185
      is why they were so
   upset about a little thing

58:10.187 --> 58:14.122
       like breaking the
       Ten Commandments.

58:14.124 --> 58:17.226
       Everyone breaks a
  commandment sooner or later.

58:17.228 --> 58:19.127
It's not like it's a mortal sin.

58:19.129 --> 58:22.998
   Actually I think it's the
  definition of a mortal sin.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.667
 Well, maybe it's for the best.

58:26.537 --> 58:28.136
    What do you mean, Zill?

58:28.138 --> 58:31.807
I mean, maybe my dad was right.

58:31.809 --> 58:33.175
We barely even know each other.

58:33.177 --> 58:35.978
         I didn't even
   know you were a Christian.

58:35.980 --> 58:37.946
      That's not the most
   important thing about me.

58:37.948 --> 58:39.147
     And we never discussed

58:39.149 --> 58:41.683
        how we re going
     to raise our children

58:41.685 --> 58:43.785
       We don't even know
 if we re gonna have children.

58:43.787 --> 58:47.089
       And everyone in my
     family gets a divorce!

58:47.091 --> 58:49.925
     Hey, hey, but it's not
      without good reason.

58:49.927 --> 58:53.262
          I mean, your
 grandparents had a fundamental

58:53.264 --> 58:57.165
difference of opinion regarding
  the definition of  monogamy

58:57.167 --> 59:00.102
          and my wife?

59:00.104 --> 59:05.073
            She was,
   quite frankly, psychotic.

59:07.011 --> 59:09.545
             Zilla.

59:09.547 --> 59:11.046
     Ever since we started
     planning this wedding

59:11.048 --> 59:13.715
   you haven't been yourself.

59:15.052 --> 59:18.320
        (CRYING SOUNDS)

59:25.262 --> 59:29.131
        What's going on?

59:30.067 --> 59:34.269
       Zoe, what is this?

59:35.239 --> 59:39.308
    It's not enough that you
 humiliated us at church today?

59:39.310 --> 59:42.010
  It's not enough that you re
 ruining your sister's wedding?

59:42.012 --> 59:45.714
   Can't you see how unhappy
   you re making your sister?

59:47.651 --> 59:51.153
          I am ashamed
I ever let you buy this camera.

59:51.155 --> 59:55.057
      I am ashamed that I
   didn't put a stop to this

59:55.059 --> 59:58.994
        horror business
     the moment it started.

59:58.996 --> 01:00:01.129
      You know what, Zoe?

01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:04.199
        I guess I'm just
        ashamed of you.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:43.705
      What are you doing?

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:45.707
          I'm leaving.

01:00:45.709 --> 01:00:46.842
           How come?

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:50.112
         You heard him!
      He's ashamed of me.

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:54.182
       Where will you go?

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.718
       I ll stay at your
   house tonight, and then..

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.420
   I ll go live with my mom.

01:00:58.422 --> 01:01:00.155
 Do you even know where she is?

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:03.692
     No, but I ll find her.

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:06.795
  What about the horror film?

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:09.264
           It's over.

01:01:16.774 --> 01:01:19.775
     -he grunts and groans-

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:37.926
          We need help
   locating a missing person.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:41.029
      Does this appear to
  be a police station to you?

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:44.366
 No, but you re the only adult
  we know who's talking to us.

01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:47.002
      Well, I do happen to
     be an expert on crime.

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:49.471
This person isn't a criminal...

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:51.773
           we think.

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:53.075
        Well, who is it?

01:01:53.077 --> 01:01:54.843
            Her mom.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:56.144
     Your mother's missing?

01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:57.145
              Yes.

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:58.213
         For how long?

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.948
        About ten years.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.249
        How old are you?

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:03.085
              Ten.

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:04.319
             I see.

01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:06.188
        So this isn't so
     much a  missing person

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:07.989
     as it is a  person who
    intentionally abandoned

01:02:07.991 --> 01:02:09.958
        her daughter and
     hasn't been seen since

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.926
         is that right?

01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:12.027
              Yes.

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:13.212
And has it occurred to you that

01:02:13.213 --> 01:02:14.396
         she might have
    done this for a reason?

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.215
         As in, rather
     than failing to share

01:02:16.216 --> 01:02:18.033
   this information with you
  because it slipped her mind

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:19.468
       she may have made
     a deliberate decision

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:20.902
        that she doesn't
      want to be bothered

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.471
     by a sniveling cretin
    who can't even remember

01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:24.005
to clean under her fingernails?

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:26.041
        You don't clean
    under your fingernails!

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.226
             DWAYNE
          Digression!

01:02:27.227 --> 01:02:28.410
       You re completely
    drifting from the point.

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:29.945
          Your mother
     doesn't even know me.

01:02:29.947 --> 01:02:32.247
    Try to be more logical.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:34.182
 We just want help finding her.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.418
      Look, if your mother
    doesn't want to meet you

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.787
forcing the acquaintance on her
  is not the kind of situation

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:40.856
      that's going to lead
     to love and cupcakes.

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:43.759
      Meanwhile, I've been
  working on your horror film.

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:45.444
        I've designed a
       trip wedding cake

01:02:45.445 --> 01:02:47.128
     that when you cut into
   it, it spurts fake blood.

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:49.765
         You wanna see?

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.833
           We re here
        for information.

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:52.868
             Fine.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:54.803
            Have you
       checked Facebook?

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.338
  She doesn't have an account.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.539
             DWAYNE
     Well when I was a boy

01:02:57.541 --> 01:02:59.007
           we had an
   old-fashioned device known

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:00.475
     as a  telephone book.

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:02.944
       You could look up
addresses in a small metal hovel

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.880
           known as a
        telephone booth.

01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:07.115
    There's one conveniently
  located at the bus station.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:12.053
     You could look her up
    and get right on a bus..

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:13.922
         I suggest you
    avoid this step though!

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:15.857
      You re only setting
     yourself up for pain.

01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:17.425
      I have to find her.

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:19.294
    My dad doesn't love me.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.363
       Actually, I'd say

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:23.431
 all evidence so far points to
  your mother not loving you.

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:26.201
Although I suppose it's possible
    that neither of them do.

01:03:26.203 --> 01:03:28.220
       What do you know?

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:30.238
     The only thing you re
    good at is horror stuff!

01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:35.177
             I also
      specialize in magic!

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:59.968
         I never wanted
       to be like my mom.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.603
          You re not.

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:03.605
        How do you know?

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:05.524
    My dad's been telling me

01:04:05.525 --> 01:04:07.442
   my whole life not to rush
  into things but I always do.

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:09.344
         Just like her.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.880
She rushed into getting married

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:13.348
          when she was
      too young to commit

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.916
         and she rushed
      into having children

01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:17.118
       before she was old
     enough to realize that

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.422
    she didn't even want us.

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:23.258
       So marriage didn't
       work out for her.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.627
 It works out for some people.

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:28.063
        It will for us.

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:30.465
        How do you know?

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:32.534
           I just do.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.370
       That doesn't seem
       like a good enough

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:38.974
reason to go through with this.

01:04:38.976 --> 01:04:40.408
         You know what?
         You re right.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.944
    You do rush into things.

01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:46.414
     You rushed into trying
    out for the soccer team

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:48.617
         when you were
        only a freshman.

01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:52.587
     And you made varsity.
    You rushed into pre-med.

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:55.991
    And now you re on track
    to graduate with honors.

01:04:55.993 --> 01:05:01.129
     It's one of the things
     that I love about you.

01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:04.633
You re impulsive and passionate

01:05:04.635 --> 01:05:07.903
     and you jump into the
    things you care about..

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:11.907
     and see them through.

01:05:14.645 --> 01:05:17.245
  Why would marriage work for
  me when it hasn't worked out

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:20.615
           for anyone
       else in my family?

01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:22.584
  I think marriage would have
    worked out for your dad

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:26.221
    if he'd married somebody
a little bit more like himself.

01:05:26.223 --> 01:05:29.157
        Look how well he
    did raising you and Zoe

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:31.626
        all by himself.

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:35.630
       You don't think we
   turned out kind of weird?

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:39.167
          Yeah, I do.

01:05:39.169 --> 01:05:42.370
  You re weird when you laugh.

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:46.274
    It's weird when you eat
  leftover soup for breakfast.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:51.179
You have this weird little dent

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:54.649
          on your lip
     from when you bite it.

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:05.360
         I love all the
    weird things about you.

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:09.030
       That's how I know
     you re the one for me.

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:12.701
      I love all the weird
     things about you, too.

01:06:12.703 --> 01:06:15.403
    Then let's get married.

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:31.486
      Are we to understand
     the wedding's back on?

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:36.992
         And where's it
      going to take place?

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:39.995
         We thought we
  could just get married here.

01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:43.298
    That's a fabulous idea.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.301
        I'm picturing..

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:49.371
             swans.
          On the lawn.

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:54.042
           By the way

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:58.046
        I couldn't help
   noticing that Zoe's gone.

01:06:58.048 --> 01:07:00.148
    What do you mean, gone?

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:03.051
    Well I went upstairs to
  press her flower girl dress

01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:04.452
     and she wasn't there.

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:06.554
      The bed didn't look
   like it had been slept in.

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:08.456
      Maybe she ran away.

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:10.291
She was pretty upset last night.

01:07:10.293 --> 01:07:14.329
  Did it look like she packed
    her clothes or anything?

01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:18.400
  No, but that vampire poster
   on her wall was missing..

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:24.506
       Frankly, I felt it
   looked better without it.

01:07:24.508 --> 01:07:26.574
   You two search the house.

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:29.244
     I ll go find Francis.

01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:37.318
        Duh nuh nuh nuh!
   Duh nuh nuh nuh! Duh nuh!

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.660
    Uh, two in one morning!
    This is really too much.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:48.430
       I can't deal with
  these kind of interruptions.

01:07:48.432 --> 01:07:52.767
      Oh. It's you again.
       What do you want?

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.135
          Do you know
          my daughter?

01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:55.804
          Zoe Balicki.

01:07:55.806 --> 01:07:57.806
            I might.

01:07:57.808 --> 01:08:02.444
     She's about this tall,
and she always carries a camera.

01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:05.713
         She's not dead
      or anything, is she?

01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:06.748
         Of course not.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:09.350
             Fine.
   She came in this morning.

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:13.521
       Yes, I believe she
   was asking you for advice?

01:08:13.523 --> 01:08:16.323
        A lot of people
       ask me for advice.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:18.493
      I can't always keep
   track of what I tell them.

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:20.328
       You told Zoe to go
     to the bus station and

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:21.696
        look up her mom
       in the phone book

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:24.232
     and then you said she-

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:26.667
       Listen, we re not
   accusing you of anything.

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:28.886
   We just want to find her.

01:08:28.888 --> 01:08:31.104
    Well, then I suggest you
 take the advice of this small

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:34.609
    flesh-eating carnivore,
   and call the bus station.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:38.279
     I'm dialing right now.

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:42.317
      You know, I wouldn't
    say this to her face but

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:44.853
your daughter's fairly talented.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:47.139
   I've seen her horror films

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.424
   and she has the potential
     to really be someone.

01:08:49.426 --> 01:08:50.792
       Someone like you?

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:53.461
     I have chosen to focus
  my talents in other spheres

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:56.865
       such as the retail
         industry and..

01:08:56.867 --> 01:08:58.832
             magic.

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:02.604
      but I believe she's
primarily interested in horror.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:06.140
  Yeah, well sorry if  horror

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:09.344
       doesn't sound like
     a viable career path.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:11.479
         It worked out
      for Stanley Kubrick.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.314
          They didn't
     sell her a bus ticket.

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.483
          Okay, look.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.651
      If her mother wasn't
   listed in the phone book,

01:09:17.652 --> 01:09:19.819
   do you have any idea where
   else she might have gone?

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:23.291
        I might know one
   other place she might be.

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:35.937
            ACTIVIST
      Keep Portland weird!

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:39.207
             Yeah,
  we got that covered, thanks.

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:07.268
              Zoe.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:10.438
            Come on.
       We re going home.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:19.781
              Hey!
      I just got in line.

01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:22.884
     I can't believe we re
    actually going to Vegas!

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:23.885
         Neither can I.

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:26.821
 Best bachelorette party ever!

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:29.224
        Well, naturally.
         I planned it.

01:10:29.226 --> 01:10:30.992
    I still think it's weird
  that the mother of the bride

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:33.695
     is going along on her
 daughter's bachelorette party.

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:35.797
        Anything to get
     her out of the house.

01:10:35.799 --> 01:10:37.932
          Why can't I
          go to Vegas?

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:40.868
          (a) Because
     you re still grounded

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:43.771
        for running away
       from home and (b)

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:46.874
  Because ten-year-olds don't
 go to these kinds of events..

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:48.977
I want you to be careful, okay?

01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:51.279
           Vegas is a
        dangerous place.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:53.248
Do not come back with pink eye.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.783
    You do not want pink eye
 in all your wedding pictures.

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:56.985
              Dad!
       That's disgusting.

01:10:56.987 --> 01:10:59.320
         Yeah. Exactly.
     It's very disgusting.

01:10:59.322 --> 01:11:00.955
         But it happens
      at bachelor parties,

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:02.824
        and I'm assuming
        it can happen at

01:11:02.826 --> 01:11:04.826
     lesbian bachelorettes.

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:06.427
   Your eye will swell up and

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:08.997
        you ll look like
      a zombie who is ill.

01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:13.401
    How do you get pink eye?

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:16.471
          Don't worry!
   The wedding's in two days.

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:21.342
   I won't let a thing happen
 to these two beautiful girls.

01:11:21.344 --> 01:11:22.577
         Are you ready
        for the big day?

01:11:22.579 --> 01:11:23.678
              Yup!

  noticed that they've chosen

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:32.720
       a self-proclaimed
      witch to marry them?

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:35.857
Okay, I think that's everything!

01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:38.760
        You won't forget
    that the ice sculptures

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:40.028
      arrive Friday night

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.996
          and the dove
     wrangler will be here

01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:44.399
        bright and early
       Saturday morning.

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:45.800
         Yeah, got it.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:46.934
             Okay!

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:48.353
           Well boys

01:11:48.354 --> 01:11:49.771
         why don't you
    drive us to the airport

01:11:49.773 --> 01:11:54.008
     and then you can pick
   up the fireworks displays?

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:11.426

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:15.963
  I never thought Zilla would
  be the type to want a crazy

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:18.032
  elaborate wedding like this.

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:21.102
       Oh, Zilla doesn't
       want this wedding.

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:42.357
          We have some
       really good stuff.

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:44.392
        Yeah, but how's
        it going to end?

01:12:44.394 --> 01:12:46.828
     I couldn't get anybody
    to do the monster dance.

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:49.497
           And we re
      almost out of time.

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:55.403
          Maybe there
      isn't a happy ending

01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:57.872
 so there is no monster dance.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:59.841
     Maybe it's a tragedy.

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:01.142
          Like Bambi.

01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:02.844
     Bambi's not a tragedy.

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:07.648
       The mom dies, Zoe.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:11.986
         Okay, so maybe
       the werewolf dies.

01:13:11.988 --> 01:13:14.722
       Maybe he realizes
    he can't marry the bride

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:16.457
      so he kills himself.

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:17.609
              How?

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:18.760
         Drive a stake
       through his heart?

01:13:18.762 --> 01:13:20.995
   That's a vampire, Francis.

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:23.531
Werewolves can die any old way.

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:26.834
Normally it isn't about figuring
  out how to kill the werewolf

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:29.871
it's figuring out whether you re
  going to be able to kill it

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:31.773
      before it kills you.

01:13:31.775 --> 01:13:35.743
         Maybe he could
      jump off the roof...

01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:44.085
             Uh uh.
        It's too steep.

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:45.987

  a special honeymoon package.

       in Colorado is...

01:18:50.293 --> 01:18:53.360
    just not that romantic.

    with a select assortment
     of spiders and insects

01:19:46.048 --> 01:19:48.315
       It's just that you
   look like a cross between

01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:52.887
         a Barbie doll
      and Queen Victoria.

01:19:52.889 --> 01:19:55.956
          This Is not,
     A good time to laugh.

       (CREAKING SOUNDS)

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:13.541
      This will be great.

01:20:13.543 --> 01:20:15.943
         Are you sure?

01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:18.095
           Of course.

01:20:18.096 --> 01:20:20.246
      The werewolf will be
 silhouetted against the trees.

01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:23.884
         No, I mean are
      you sure it's safe?

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:26.220

      do it all the time.

01:20:26.222 --> 01:20:29.056
       Well yeah, but I'm
 pretty sure a lot of them die.

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:31.075
            If I die

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.093
   make sure this gets edited
  and submitted before Sunday.

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:38.432
   Hey, don't get mad at me.
   You did this to yourself.

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:40.201
  I didn't do this to myself!

01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:41.335
        Your mother did.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.070
            Exactly.
        And you let her.

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:45.873
   What part of my childhood
 stories do you not understand?

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:48.142
     Do not let this woman
  get within three feet of you

01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:50.511
    with mascara, a curling
  iron, or a set of tweezers!

01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:52.580
      I wouldn't have had
     to if you hadn't left!

01:20:52.582 --> 01:20:54.582
        Oh, I'm supposed
       to sit around here

01:20:54.584 --> 01:20:56.917
      and let my head get
dipped into toxic waste because

01:20:56.919 --> 01:20:59.086
   you don't have the guts to
   stand up for who you are?

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:02.089
     This isn't about that!
   Why can't you understand?

01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:03.457
        Understand what?

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:05.125
That you want her for a mother?

01:21:05.127 --> 01:21:07.928
          This is what
   having a mother is about!

01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:10.130
      She's been trying to
  turn me into a beauty queen

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:13.133
        pageant princess
     for twenty-five years!

01:21:13.135 --> 01:21:15.903
   I've fought my whole life
  for the right to be who I am

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:17.171
          and I'm not
     going to give that up

01:21:17.173 --> 01:21:18.973
    just because you want to
     suck up to my mother.

01:21:18.975 --> 01:21:21.976
   Suck up to your mother? Is
 that what you think I'm doing?

01:21:21.978 --> 01:21:24.545
 It seems like it to me, yeah.

01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:27.414
      You have no idea how
  lucky you are to have a mom!

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:30.084
     I'm getting a divorce!

01:21:34.023 --> 01:21:36.090
             What?

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:44.365
       Maybe the werewolf
     could just take pills.

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:47.434
       Just focus on the
     cinematography, okay?

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:56.510
   I didn't want to tell you
 this until after the wedding.

01:21:56.512 --> 01:22:00.014
    Your father and I just..

01:22:00.016 --> 01:22:04.184
             well,
   we can't stand each other.

01:22:04.186 --> 01:22:07.521
     And I wanted to throw
      the perfect wedding

01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:09.323
          for you both

01:22:09.325 --> 01:22:11.692
       because I love you

01:22:11.694 --> 01:22:15.129
     and... I guess, well,

01:22:15.131 --> 01:22:19.300
    I wanted you to love me
more than you love your father.

01:22:22.238 --> 01:22:25.105
             Okay.

01:22:27.043 --> 01:22:29.043
          Okay, what?

01:22:29.045 --> 01:22:32.112
        Okay, we ll love
       you more than Dad.

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:36.267
            Really?

01:22:36.268 --> 01:22:38.419
   Yeah, it's not that hard,
   Dad's kind of an asshole.

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:44.258
         What can I do

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:47.161
      to give you both the
    wedding of your dreams?

01:22:47.163 --> 01:22:49.463
   Mom, don't you understand?

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:52.132
  I don't care about weddings.

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:54.468
 I'm only doing this for Zilla.

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:56.337
        Are you kidding?

01:22:56.339 --> 01:23:01.241
          I don't even
       want this wedding.

01:23:01.243 --> 01:23:04.311
          Then why are
         we doing this?

           Well, it's
       really happening.

       and truly becoming

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.306
      a permanent lesbian.

            You know

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:11.612
      I once met a lesbian
     at the senior center.

01:24:11.614 --> 01:24:13.547
 I think she had a crush on me.

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:16.817
              Mom!
      Did you lead her on?

01:24:16.819 --> 01:24:18.786
         I might have.

01:24:18.788 --> 01:24:21.321
           Well, she
      was very attractive

01:24:21.323 --> 01:24:24.391
     considering she was a
   woman and had false teeth.

01:24:26.429 --> 01:24:28.629
   Is everything ready to go?

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:30.798
        Yes, thank God.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.067

         with four air
       conditioning units

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.139
     and I finally got the
       male swan to stop

01:24:39.141 --> 01:24:41.842
    attacking the violinist.

01:24:41.844 --> 01:24:44.511

      you worked on this.

  we finally realized that...

         neither of us
      wanted this wedding.

  setting up out on the lawn.

     Zoe's in the hospital.

01:25:48.878 --> 01:25:50.310
         What happened?

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:52.212
         I don't know.
        They didn't say.

    the night at Francis's.

            Oh God.

01:25:57.219 --> 01:25:59.553
    The last thing she said
  before she left was that...

01:25:59.555 --> 01:26:02.389
       I don't love her.

01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:03.690
       What did you say?

01:26:03.692 --> 01:26:08.195
       I said, she makes
       it hard sometimes.

01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:13.433
           Okay, bro.
     It's going to be okay.

01:26:13.435 --> 01:26:14.768
 Also you re driving right now,

01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:17.671
      so I really need you
      to look at the road.

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:19.673
That was Francis's grandmother.

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:22.209
          She said Zoe
      jumped off the roof.

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:24.845
  She's under anesthetic right
  now so we can't see her yet.

01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:28.916
But the nurse wants us to bring
 her clothes and insurance card

01:26:28.918 --> 01:26:32.452
   and maybe a stuffed animal
 or something to cheer her up.

01:26:32.454 --> 01:26:33.820
 Most of Zoe's stuffed animals

01:26:33.822 --> 01:26:35.389
          have parted
     ways with their heads

01:26:35.391 --> 01:26:37.958
        so I don't know
     how cheerful that is.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.228
        What else would
        make her happy?

  We ll put them in the coffin

01:30:32.027 --> 01:30:35.028
     and she can enjoy them
    when she wakes up. Okay?

01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:38.098
           Me first.
       I brought maggots.

          Fake blood.

01:30:40.068 --> 01:30:42.035
    I mean, I know she just
  had real blood transfusions.

01:30:42.037 --> 01:30:44.504
        So she might not
      need it until later.

Mom, do you have an extra pair?

01:30:57.719 --> 01:31:00.754
      Um, it's a colander.

01:31:00.756 --> 01:31:04.891

01:31:10.899 --> 01:31:14.100
  I noticed her supply in the
   refrigerator was dwindling

01:31:14.102 --> 01:31:15.535
  and I don't want to know why

01:31:15.537 --> 01:31:17.604

         We needed the
    footage for the ending.

01:31:37.993 --> 01:31:39.893
    It wasn't because of me?

01:31:39.895 --> 01:31:42.762
        Why would it be?

01:31:42.764 --> 01:31:46.166
     I thought maybe it was
    because I yelled at her.

  two days before the deadline
