00:16.642 --> 00:17.848
[sniffs]

00:56.641 --> 00:59.053
These are the last two eggs.

01:07.318 --> 01:09.309
From my own bookshelf.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.486
- Help you pass the time.
- I've already read it.

01:12.615 --> 01:15.982
You might catch something
you missed the second time around.

01:18.204 --> 01:21.037
Why did you move me
from the rec room down here?

01:21.165 --> 01:23.656
I wanted you under my own roof.

01:27.338 --> 01:30.250
Where are you keeping
your other prisoner? Miles, is it?

01:31.509 --> 01:34.922
- Or you don't want to share.
- l was hoping you would share, Ben,

01:35.054 --> 01:37.545
seeing as you claimed
to have a spy on his ship.

01:42.812 --> 01:46.020
| feel for you, John. I really do.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.852
You keep hitting dead ends.

01:51.028 --> 01:55.522
You couldn't find the cabin,
you can't make contact with Jacob.

01:55.658 --> 01:59.901
You're so desperate to figure out what
to do next you're asking me for help.

02:03.249 --> 02:06.116
So here we are, just like old times.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.035
Except l'm locked in a different room.

02:12.383 --> 02:15.045
And you're more lost
than you ever were.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.548
I know what you're trying to do.

02:18.681 --> 02:20.137
It's not gonna work.

02:20.224 --> 02:23.762
- Excellent, John. You're evolving.
- Done with your breakfast?

02:30.151 --> 02:32.483
[door locks]

02:46.083 --> 02:47.698
What's that all about?

02:49.545 --> 02:51.456
Who knows? lt's Locke.

02:53.424 --> 02:55.255
Mornin', ladies.

02:55.343 --> 02:58.210
- Good morning.
- Mornin'.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.928
Hm, coffee smells good.

03:02.016 --> 03:06.100
Well, why don't I go make you a cup?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.479
Kinda weird, ain't it?

03:15.780 --> 03:19.318
Sitting on porches,
drinking coffee out of mugs.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.865
Anyway, I found some clothes
about your size.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.738
Hung 'em in the closet.

03:23.829 --> 03:27.788
- So after I kick out Hugo...
- I'm not moving in with you, James.

03:29.335 --> 03:33.999
- Well... then why did you stay?
- That's none of your business.

03:34.090 --> 03:36.832
You got a secret agenda, huh?

03:37.802 --> 03:40.714
- If you're spying for Jack...
- I'm not spying for anyone.

03:40.805 --> 03:43.547
- Why don't you tell...?
- Because I don't trust you.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.560
This is about the pregnancy thing.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.892
- James.
- Yeah?

03:56.737 --> 03:57.772
Go home.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.189
OK, fine.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.863
[sighs]

04:05.746 --> 04:07.247
See you later then.

04:19.844 --> 04:21.505
You ready?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.555
Is there a back entrance?

04:23.639 --> 04:25.846
Yeah, but you're going in
the front door

04:25.933 --> 04:28.015
with your head held high, OK?

04:30.354 --> 04:32.766
Yeah. OK.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.355
Let's do this.

04:36.527 --> 04:37.733
[car door opens]

04:39.655 --> 04:41.771
[indistinct yelling]

04:41.866 --> 04:43.572
What was your statement?

04:46.203 --> 04:50.037
Folks, we're not making any statements
or answering any questions.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.242
[man] Help us out here, please.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.465
[man] The People vs.
Katherine Anne Austen.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.211
The Honorable Arthur Galzethron
presiding.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.881
The bailiff will read the counts.
Will the defendant please rise?

05:05.389 --> 05:08.722
Katherine Anne Austen,
you are charged with fraud,

05:08.851 --> 05:11.263
arson, assault on a federal officer,

05:11.395 --> 05:13.260
assault with a deadly weapon,

05:13.355 --> 05:16.062
grand larceny, grand theft auto

05:16.192 --> 05:18.308
and murder in the first degree.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.768
Miss Austen, how do you plead?

05:23.949 --> 05:25.064
Not guilty.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.241
- [crowd murmuring]
- Thus entered.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.909
l'll now hear argument on bail.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.330
Your Honor, we are requesting
the defendant be remanded

05:33.417 --> 05:35.624
into custody
for the duration of the trial.

05:35.753 --> 05:38.335
My client's been free
pending arraignment.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.459
- Now she's a flight risk?
- The definition of a flight risk.

05:41.592 --> 05:45.710
She has one of the most recognizable
faces. Where will she run?

05:45.804 --> 05:48.136
Miss Austen,
based on your prior history,

05:48.224 --> 05:52.092
I'm inclined to agree with the People.
You're remanded into federal custody

05:52.186 --> 05:56.020
for the duration of your trial. Bailiff,
take the defendant into custody.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.939
- [gavel slams]
- Sorry.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.047
"Albuquerque?"

06:28.138 --> 06:29.298
Too hot.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.967
- New York.
- Too many people.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.471
[speaking Korean]

06:44.488 --> 06:47.776
I learn English for you.

06:49.994 --> 06:53.612
To live in America.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.417
[woman] Hey, look! Jack!

07:09.263 --> 07:10.844
Jack!

07:11.181 --> 07:12.967
All right.

07:13.517 --> 07:14.506
[man] Hey, man.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.844
- This is... Charlotte, Dan.
- Hey, welcome.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.394
- [woman] Hey.
- [woman 2] Hey.

07:19.481 --> 07:23.690
Their helicopter already took Sayid
and Desmond back to their freighter.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.065
They can make arrangements
to get all of us off this island.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.865
Where's Kate?

07:31.785 --> 07:33.366
She stayed with Locke.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.577
Hello, Kate.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.910
Is that blood?

07:43.005 --> 07:45.712
| just killed a chicken.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.253
What can I do for you?

07:49.011 --> 07:51.718
I want to talk to Miles.
Where are you keeping him?

07:51.805 --> 07:55.013
- Why do you need to talk to him?
- That's personal.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.016
No.

07:58.103 --> 08:01.812
- And what gives you the right...
- You may think this is a democracy

08:07.446 --> 08:10.028
Then I guess that makes it
a dictatorship.

08:10.658 --> 08:14.446
If I was a dictator, I would just
shoot you and go about my day.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.366
Dinner's at 6:00 if you're hungry.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.670
Wait. You bringing that to Miles?

08:30.761 --> 08:32.797
- Yeah.
- Locke asked me to do it.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.129
Cool. That dude creeps me out.

08:35.224 --> 08:38.842
- He's still in the rec room, right?
- I moved him to the boathouse...

08:44.858 --> 08:47.315
You just totally
Scooby-Doo'd me, didn't you?

08:47.403 --> 08:48.438
Sorry.

08:49.071 --> 08:52.188
- You're not gonna let him go, are you?
- No. No, I promise.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.318
Just don't tell Locke it was me.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.327
[birds chirping, squawking]

09:28.152 --> 09:30.313
So the Arab traded you too.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.284
- Do you know who I am?
- Excuse me?

09:43.375 --> 09:45.491
Do you know who I am?

09:47.713 --> 09:49.374
Do you know what I did?

09:51.508 --> 09:53.373
What did you do?

09:54.219 --> 09:55.800
Answer the question.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.505
OK.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.801
I'll tell you what you want to know,

10:04.897 --> 10:07.013
but you gotta do something
for me first.

10:08.192 --> 10:11.059
- I'm not letting you go.
- I don't want to be let go.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.939
I am exactly where I want to be.

10:15.407 --> 10:20.697
What I want is one minute
of someone's time.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.570
You bring him to me...

10:23.665 --> 10:27.624
...and lwill tell you
everything I know about you.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.286
Who?

10:34.176 --> 10:35.791
Who do you think?

10:41.642 --> 10:43.803
[indistinct chattering]

10:51.193 --> 10:53.900
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, fine.

10:54.738 --> 10:58.401
Listen, the DA's decided
to try this case herself...

10:59.243 --> 11:02.110
...which means they're
gonna do the full-court press.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.570
We need to start talking about
cutting a deal.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.571
- What kind of deal?
- My best guess,

11:06.667 --> 11:09.750
I'd say she'll take a 15-year sentence.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.795
- And you serve seven.
- No way.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.670
If you go to trial, you're looking
at 20 years on each count

11:17.761 --> 11:19.922
and a life sentence
on the murder charge.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.550
- No.
- Kate, you confessed to your mother

11:22.641 --> 11:26.350
that you killed your father,
and now she's their star witness.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.437
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to win this?

11:30.566 --> 11:32.102
Put me on the stand.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.854
And take a chance with the DA
crossing you? No.

11:35.654 --> 11:38.612
Way | see it,
we've got one shot at this.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.315
- What's that?
- We make it about character.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.693
Not about what you did or didn't do,
but about who you are.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.284
What do you mean, who I am?

11:49.793 --> 11:52.876
- I want him in the courtroom.
- Absolutely not.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.454
We need him, Kate.
lt'll generate sympathy.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.586
Duncan, listen to me.
You are not bringing him in here.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.714
You want to make this about me,
my character, fine.

12:01.805 --> 12:05.844
But you are not using my son.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.055
[chattering indistinctly]

12:10.147 --> 12:11.478
[busy signal]

12:11.565 --> 12:14.227
Maybe we should try a number
other than the boat,

12:14.318 --> 12:16.149
like 911.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.564
- [beeps]
- What's wrong?

12:21.658 --> 12:25.367
Nothing. We're just having trouble
getting ahold of their boat.

12:25.454 --> 12:29.322
You haven't heard from Sayid?
You said they left yesterday.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.077
And I'm sure they're fine.

12:33.462 --> 12:34.747
What if Locke was right?

12:34.838 --> 12:37.045
What if these people
are here to hurt us?

12:37.174 --> 12:39.165
Locke has no idea what he's doing.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.667
Then why is Kate with him?

12:46.016 --> 12:48.177
[birds chirping]

12:52.731 --> 12:54.892
You sure he's got Ben
in his basement?

12:54.983 --> 12:58.066
Uh-huh. I saw Rousseau
take him in there last night.

12:58.153 --> 13:01.737
- And does Locke ever go out?
- He's been in there cooking all day.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.609
He invited us all over for dinner.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.736
[Aaron crying]

13:05.827 --> 13:08.079
Oh, can you get Aaron for me?

13:11.166 --> 13:13.623
Just pick him up
and rock him a little bit.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.452
- Um...
- [gurgles]

13:17.047 --> 13:20.289
Yeah, l'mjust...
not very good with babies.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.375
I wouldn't want him
to get more upset.

13:22.469 --> 13:26.178
- [Aaron gurgling]
- Here, I got him.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.761
Oh...

13:30.852 --> 13:33.059
- [whimpers]
- It's OK.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.309
- There we go, muffin.
- [grunts]

13:36.400 --> 13:37.389
There we go.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.111
You're so good with him.

13:40.195 --> 13:42.686
- [babbles]
- [laughs]

13:43.281 --> 13:44.270
What?

13:44.366 --> 13:48.109
Just the last thing I ever thought
I'd be good at is being a mom.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.162
You know, you should try it sometime.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.581
Hey, Aaron.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.332
[Bailiff] Please rise.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.422
Court is now in session.
Please be seated.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.432
- Don't fire me, OK?
- What?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.685
We got killed in the opening.
I had to do this.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.982
Does the defense have a witness?

14:22.320 --> 14:23.821
Yes, we do, Your Honor.

14:23.905 --> 14:27.693
The defense calls Dr. Jack Shephard
to the witness stand.

14:37.586 --> 14:40.578
Your Honor, I'd like to renew
my objection to this witness

14:40.672 --> 14:44.756
- on the basis of relevance.
- And I'll renew my overruling.

14:45.427 --> 14:48.510
You have to be aware this witness
did not meet the defendant

14:48.597 --> 14:51.805
until after the alleged crimes
she's being charged with.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.884
He is to be viewed
as a character witness only.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.140
- Proceed.
- Please raise your right hand.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.643
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

15:00.734 --> 15:02.941
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

15:03.028 --> 15:04.438
Yes.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.194
Dr. Shephard.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.987
Could you please tell the ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

15:15.082 --> 15:18.995
if there are any of you who don't read
newspapers, the internet or watch TV,

15:19.086 --> 15:21.077
how you met the defendant?

15:21.171 --> 15:22.786
Um...

15:22.881 --> 15:25.839
On September 22, 2004,

15:25.926 --> 15:28.087
Kate, uh... [chuckles]

15:29.012 --> 15:30.593
Miss Austen and l

15:30.680 --> 15:33.012
were both passengers
on Oceanic flight 815,

15:33.100 --> 15:35.887
which crash-landed on an island
in the South Pacific.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.514
Were you aware Miss Austen
was a fugitive

15:38.605 --> 15:42.723
being transported by a United States
marshal on that flight to Los Angeles?

15:42.818 --> 15:46.276
- I did learn that eventually, yes.
- From the US marshal?

15:46.363 --> 15:48.820
No, the marshal died in the crash.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.984
I never spoke to him.
Miss Austen told me.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.324
Did you ever ask her if she was guilty?

16:00.418 --> 16:02.249
No. Never.

16:02.337 --> 16:05.124
That seems like a reasonable question.
Why not?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.833
| just assumed there had been
some kind of mistake.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.918
And why would you think that?

16:12.931 --> 16:16.389
Only eight of us survived the crash.
We landed in the water.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.562
l was hurt pretty badly.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.389
In fact, if it weren't for her I would
have never made it to the shore.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.850
[chuckles] She took care of me,
took care of all of us.

16:26.945 --> 16:30.233
She gave us first aid, water,

16:30.323 --> 16:32.655
found food, made shelter.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.984
- She tried to save the other two...
- Stop.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.036
Miss Austen, please sit down.

16:39.124 --> 16:42.457
This has nothing to do with...
with anything.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.838
This is my trial, and I don't want him
to say anything else.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.758
That's fine. I have no more questions,
Your Honor.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.796
[Judge] Miss Dunbrook, your witness.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.602
That was very moving, Dr. Shephard.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.102
| only have one question for you.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.438
- Do you love the defendant?
- Objection!

17:10.113 --> 17:13.822
You opened this door, Mr. Forrester.
I'm going to allow it.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.655
Dr. Shephard?

17:19.289 --> 17:21.075
Do you love Miss Austen?

17:23.543 --> 17:24.532
No.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.794
Not anymore.

17:37.807 --> 17:42.050
So, what do you want to watch,
Xanadu or Satan's Doom?

17:42.145 --> 17:43.646
I'm reading.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.980
[J‘ Olivia Newton John: Xanadu]

17:47.067 --> 17:49.149
- Will you turn that thing down?
- Sorry.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.478
- [lowers volume]
- [knock on door]

17:59.955 --> 18:02.617
- Hey.
- Can I come in?

18:04.834 --> 18:07.291
Sure. I believe you know my roommate.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.370
- Hi, Hurley.
- Hey, Kate.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.048
You got something in your eye, Hugo?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.051
Why don't we talk in the kitchen.

18:23.979 --> 18:27.722
I know it's in a box,
but it's pretty damn good wine.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.772
I tested it.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.942
So how's life at casa de Claire?

18:33.029 --> 18:37.614
- Baby Aaron keeping you up all night?
- No. He's a good sleeper.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.692
Good for you.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.073
[exhales deeply]

18:46.876 --> 18:48.707
You are terrible at this, Freckles.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.126
Terrible at what?

18:51.214 --> 18:53.796
You already said you didn't
stay behind for me.

18:54.551 --> 18:58.544
At least be woman enough to tell me
you want to use me for something.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.341
I want to use you for something.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.718
See? Wasn't that hard.

19:08.231 --> 19:11.223
- [exhales] For what?
- For Ben.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.395
I want you to help me bust him out.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.617
Want to play some backgammon?

19:24.164 --> 19:25.153
You're on.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.630
Do you think I know what I'm doing?

19:37.802 --> 19:39.542
Huh?

19:39.637 --> 19:43.129
Do you regret following me out here?

19:43.224 --> 19:46.261
Are you worried about
what we should do next?

19:48.646 --> 19:52.480
All I know is I'd be a lot more worried
if I was sitting on that beach.

19:52.567 --> 19:55.024
And the rest of the group,
what are they saying?

19:55.111 --> 19:56.942
I think they're saying "baa."

19:57.280 --> 20:01.364
[chuckles] That's the nice thing
about sheep. They're predictable.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.737
But I ain't so sure about Kate.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.824
What do you mean?

20:11.711 --> 20:12.871
[sighs]

20:12.962 --> 20:15.669
I need your word you ain't gonna
do nothing to her.

20:15.757 --> 20:19.045
- Why would I do anything...?
- Just give me your word, John.

20:22.597 --> 20:25.885
- You know what? Forget it.
- No, no, no. All right.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.307
- [sighs deeply]
- You have my word.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.513
She came to me about an hour ago.

20:33.316 --> 20:36.433
Said she wanted my help
busting Ben out of your basement.

20:38.154 --> 20:42.818
- Why?
- She talked to that guy...

20:42.909 --> 20:45.867
Bruce Lee, from the freighter,
the guy you got locked up.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.320
He told her to bring Ben down
to him for a chat.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.578
No, that's impossible.
She doesn't know where Miles is.

20:51.668 --> 20:54.205
The boathouse down by the dock?

20:54.295 --> 20:56.627
lf Hugo knows, everybody knows.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.425
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.844
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going with that?

21:08.935 --> 21:11.517
Whatever Miles has to say to Ben...

21:11.646 --> 21:13.352
...he can say to me.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.031
Son of a bitch.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.663
[shatters]

21:47.682 --> 21:49.547
[creaks]

21:49.642 --> 21:50.973
Come on.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.495
[clanks]

22:18.254 --> 22:20.290
You got one minute. Go.

22:22.717 --> 22:25.754
- How about some privacy?
- Fifty-five seconds.

22:28.556 --> 22:31.593
- You know who I am?
- Yes.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.684
- You know who I work for?
- Yes.

22:35.772 --> 22:39.310
And you know he's put a lot of time
and energy into finding you.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.106
So now I found you.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.609
And I can tell him exactly
where you are.

22:49.285 --> 22:52.743
Or I can lie and tell him
you're already dead.

22:54.290 --> 22:58.499
And I'd be willing to do that
for $3.2 million.

23:01.631 --> 23:04.623
You've arranged this meeting
so you could blackmail me?

23:05.218 --> 23:07.709
lt's extortion,
if you want to get technical.

23:07.804 --> 23:10.637
Three-point-two...
Why not 3.3 or 3.4?

23:15.687 --> 23:18.599
What makes you think l have
access to that kind of money?

23:18.690 --> 23:20.726
Do not treat me like I'm one of them,

23:20.817 --> 23:24.526
like I don't know who you are
and what you can do.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.655
Your friend Charlotte has seen me.
She knows I'm alive.

23:28.741 --> 23:32.199
I'll take care of Charlotte. You worry
about getting me the money.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.579
You have two days.

23:33.663 --> 23:37.576
My present situation is a little bit
restricted. Can that be amended?

23:37.667 --> 23:38.702
OK.

23:40.295 --> 23:42.911
- One week, in cash...
- Time's up.

23:43.006 --> 23:45.543
- Don't even think about...
- I said time's up!

23:49.053 --> 23:50.338
This is hot.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.421
You got your meeting.
I want my answer.

23:55.852 --> 23:58.594
We got your name
when you called the freighter.

23:59.188 --> 24:02.225
Of course we know about you
and everybody else on the 815.

24:02.358 --> 24:05.942
- Prove it.
- Your name is Katherine Anne Austen.

24:06.029 --> 24:08.520
You're wanted for murder,
fraud, arson,

24:08.615 --> 24:11.072
whole bunch of other stuff
I can't remember.

24:11.159 --> 24:12.774
You're a fugitive.

24:12.869 --> 24:16.407
You were caught in Australia
and the feds were bringing you back.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.747
So yeah, we know.

24:22.045 --> 24:24.878
If I were you, I'd stay right here
on the island.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.797
Who knows? Maybe you
didn't survive the crash.

24:28.885 --> 24:31.547
- Come on, come on.
- [slams]

24:35.808 --> 24:36.888
[gun cocks]

24:39.395 --> 24:40.976
Go back to your house, Kate.

24:41.773 --> 24:45.686
- John, this has nothing to do with you.
- Go back to your house, Kate!

24:59.749 --> 25:02.240
[J‘ Patsy Cline: She's Got You]

25:07.090 --> 25:09.752
Hi. You OK?

25:11.636 --> 25:13.172
I couldn't sleep.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.345
Yeah, the beds
take a little getting used to.

25:17.183 --> 25:20.596
- I didn't wake Aaron, did I?
- No. Aaron was born on this island.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.223
He can sleep through anything.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.263
John.

25:27.068 --> 25:31.311
- What are you doing?
- I'd like a moment alone with Kate.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.613
Would you excuse us, please, Claire?

25:35.618 --> 25:36.983
It's OK.

25:41.916 --> 25:45.204
- John...
- I don't need to know why you did

25:45.294 --> 25:47.876
what you did, Kate.

25:47.964 --> 25:50.751
| just need to know what they said
to each other.

25:53.386 --> 25:56.970
Miles told Ben he would lie to
the people he works for on the boat,

25:57.056 --> 26:00.173
tell them Ben was dead for $3.2 million.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.890
Hm?

26:04.981 --> 26:07.563
Listen, John, I'm sorry.

26:07.650 --> 26:11.188
- | asked you where he was...
- You're not welcome here anymore.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.774
I want you gone by morning.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.198
[door slams]

26:39.348 --> 26:42.215
I worked it out so you two
can have a few minutes of privacy.

26:42.310 --> 26:45.268
- I don't need any privacy.
- You need to talk to her, Kate.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.513
I'll be outside.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.318
Hello, Katherine.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.323
Was it true, what he said?

27:06.209 --> 27:07.995
Dr. Shephard.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.586
That you're a hero?

27:19.222 --> 27:20.803
Why won't you talk to me?

27:20.890 --> 27:24.883
Because, Mom, the last time I tried
to talk to you, when you got sick,

27:25.019 --> 27:28.136
when l risked my life to see you,
you called the police.

27:28.231 --> 27:29.562
Please.

27:32.902 --> 27:35.063
I don't want to fight with you,
Katherine.

27:36.614 --> 27:38.730
Why are you here?

27:43.579 --> 27:45.570
Because...

27:51.963 --> 27:55.672
It all changed,
when I thought you were dead.

28:02.974 --> 28:07.809
My doctors have given me six months
to live for the last four years.

28:08.938 --> 28:11.520
I don't know how long I'm going to last.

28:12.817 --> 28:15.103
I came here to tell you that l...

28:16.445 --> 28:19.187
I don't want to testify against you.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.289
Then don't.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.706
I want to see my grandson.

28:45.308 --> 28:47.344
You came here to make a deal?

28:47.435 --> 28:50.142
Just want to meet him.

28:51.814 --> 28:53.770
I don't want you anywhere near him.

28:58.446 --> 29:00.061
[Kate] We're finished.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.654
We're finished!

29:07.872 --> 29:09.032
Oh, hey, Freckles.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.618
[lock clicks]

29:14.629 --> 29:16.039
[grunts]

29:16.130 --> 29:17.461
You OK?

29:22.595 --> 29:25.052
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't do nothing.

29:25.139 --> 29:27.846
I wanted him to think
that you fooled me too.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.677
No sense in him
not trusting both of us.

29:35.483 --> 29:37.314
He wants me gone by tomorrow.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.560
What, he banished you?

29:42.657 --> 29:45.023
Well, | unbanish you.

29:48.621 --> 29:51.954
- You can stay right here.
- [chuckles]

29:52.041 --> 29:54.532
[grunts] This is my house.

29:56.337 --> 29:58.578
[toilet flushes]

29:59.632 --> 30:02.419
- OK, me and Montezuma's house.
- {giggles}

30:04.553 --> 30:06.464
You're gonna be all right.

30:07.264 --> 30:08.720
I'll keep you safe.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.825
Time. OK, tell me.

30:33.916 --> 30:35.781
What do you remember?

30:35.876 --> 30:38.868
OK, queen of diamonds?

30:40.631 --> 30:43.589
Then we have the six...

30:43.676 --> 30:46.463
...of clubs. Sorry.

30:47.263 --> 30:50.380
And we have a red ten of...

30:52.935 --> 30:54.391
...hearts, maybe?

31:01.944 --> 31:04.151
lt's two out of three.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.187
It's not bad.

31:06.282 --> 31:07.488
lt's progress.

31:08.075 --> 31:10.782
Three cards, Charlotte?

31:10.870 --> 31:12.360
Is that progress?

31:12.455 --> 31:13.786
[Jack] Hey.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.160
I'm calling your boat all day.

31:17.251 --> 31:20.709
- Why isn't anyone answering?
- We're here. How should we know?

31:20.796 --> 31:24.584
- If they're not answering...
- There's only one line on that boat?

31:27.928 --> 31:31.591
There is another number we're only
supposed to use in emergencies.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.349
It's an emergency.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.487
Put it on speaker.

31:48.991 --> 31:52.233
[beeping, ringing]

31:57.374 --> 32:00.582
- [woman] Yeah?
- Regina, it's Charlotte.

32:00.669 --> 32:02.876
[Regina]
Why are you calling this number?

32:02.963 --> 32:05.921
Minkowski wasn't answering.
The people on the island

32:06.008 --> 32:08.670
want to talk to their friends,
make sure they're OK.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.843
[Regina] What friends?

32:12.223 --> 32:14.054
[Charlotte] They left last night.

32:14.141 --> 32:16.257
Frank took them up in the helicopter.

32:16.352 --> 32:20.641
[Regina] What do you mean?
/ thought the helicopter was with you.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.622
Good morning.

32:44.755 --> 32:47.918
Listen, I don't know
what you think you're doing,

32:48.008 --> 32:51.136
- but you're wasting your time.
- Open your mouth.

32:51.220 --> 32:52.551
Open your mouth.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.796
- Wide.
- [grunts]

32:54.890 --> 32:56.630
Don't talk. Bite down, bite down.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.807
- [clicks]
- [grunts]

32:58.894 --> 33:01.476
I realize, when l tied you up in here
the other day,

33:01.564 --> 33:04.271
I made the mistake of failing
to introduce myself.

33:04.400 --> 33:05.560
My name is John Locke,

33:05.693 --> 33:08.810
and I'm responsible
for the well-being of this island.

33:08.904 --> 33:11.691
Eventually, Miles, you're gonna
tell me who you are,

33:11.782 --> 33:14.319
and you'll tell me about the people
on the boat

33:14.410 --> 33:16.526
and why you're so interested in Ben.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.156
In the meantime, however,

33:18.247 --> 33:20.613
you're gonna keep your mouth shut.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.832
[muffled grunts]

33:23.919 --> 33:25.500
I learned something yesterday.

33:25.588 --> 33:28.625
No use having rules if there's
no punishment for breaking them.

33:28.716 --> 33:30.172
[whimpers]

33:30.259 --> 33:32.875
You'll be fine if you bite down
on the trigger.

33:32.970 --> 33:34.506
[whimpers]

33:34.597 --> 33:37.259
- Enjoy your breakfast.
- [muffled screams]

34:05.169 --> 34:06.659
[gasps]

34:09.048 --> 34:10.709
[grunts] Wait, wait.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.051
Wait. Just slow down.

34:13.135 --> 34:16.468
Oh, come on. It's not like
we ain't ever done it before.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.927
I'm cool we didn't go all the way
last night.

34:21.018 --> 34:23.725
| get it. You were sad.

34:23.812 --> 34:28.226
But, I mean, how can you resist
after that whole

34:28.317 --> 34:30.478
- "I'll keep you safe" thing?
- [chuckles]

34:30.569 --> 34:32.434
No. Sawyer.

34:33.656 --> 34:36.113
What? [gasps]

34:36.200 --> 34:38.065
What'd I say?

34:38.160 --> 34:39.661
Forget it.

34:40.162 --> 34:44.826
Oh, right. You still think
you might be pregnant.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.496
I'm not worried.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.878
And I'm not pregnant.

34:57.638 --> 35:00.596
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

35:00.683 --> 35:02.264
[chuckles]

35:02.351 --> 35:05.309
I mean... Whoo!

35:05.396 --> 35:07.762
Would it have been
the worst thing in the world?

35:07.856 --> 35:11.189
Yes! It would have been
the worst thing in the world.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.938
What would we have done with a baby?

35:15.030 --> 35:17.817
- I'm going back to the beach.
- The beach?

35:17.908 --> 35:21.275
What, you're leaving?
Because of this? That's that?

35:21.370 --> 35:23.611
You crawl up in my bed one second,
the next...

35:23.706 --> 35:24.991
Goodbye, James.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.076
[sighs]

35:27.167 --> 35:31.251
Don't make this about me, Kate. You
didn't want a baby any more than I did.

35:31.964 --> 35:35.297
You're looking for some excuse
to split, now you got one.

35:36.969 --> 35:40.427
That's all right, Freckles,
I ain't gonna hold it against you.

35:40.514 --> 35:43.551
I'm just gonna sit right here
in my comfy bed,

35:43.684 --> 35:45.299
because in about a week,

35:45.394 --> 35:48.978
you'll find some reason to get pissed
at Jack and bounce right back to me.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.565
- [slaps]
- [grunts]

36:00.242 --> 36:01.573
[door opens]

36:06.832 --> 36:09.244
[indistinct whispering]

36:12.546 --> 36:14.537
[muttering]

36:15.132 --> 36:18.920
...got back last night, I know
which doctor she's been seeing...

36:19.762 --> 36:21.593
Miss Dunbrook.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.096
May we approach the bench,
Your Honor?

36:28.187 --> 36:29.427
Oh, please.

36:35.736 --> 36:38.352
Unfortunately, Your Honor,
our chief witness,

36:38.447 --> 36:41.780
Diane Jansen, the mother of
the defendant, is unable to testify

36:41.867 --> 36:44.734
- because of medical reasons.
- How long will you need?

36:46.288 --> 36:47.653
I can't say right now.

36:47.748 --> 36:49.739
What I'll do is grant a recess
for lunch,

36:49.833 --> 36:53.371
but be prepared to proceed
with your case after we return.

36:53.462 --> 36:56.374
- This court is now in recess.
- [gavel slams]

36:56.465 --> 36:57.545
[Bailiff] All rise.

37:00.094 --> 37:01.800
We have to talk.

37:06.392 --> 37:10.226
My key witness spoke to her daughter
yesterday, now she's got cold feet.

37:10.312 --> 37:13.930
Quit posturing. Let's get to it.
What are you offering?

37:15.567 --> 37:16.898
Four years in.

37:20.322 --> 37:23.109
No jail time.
Kate Austen is a worldwide hero

37:23.200 --> 37:26.158
who saved five other people's lives
after a plane crash

37:26.245 --> 37:28.827
and nearly starved to death
on a deserted island.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.405
After all that,
you put this woman on trial

37:31.542 --> 37:34.500
for rescuing her mother
from an abusive husband.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.920
If you think that jury
is gonna give her actual time,

37:39.007 --> 37:42.750
then you must have
a hell of a closing, Melissa.

37:42.845 --> 37:45.712
Hm.

37:45.806 --> 37:47.137
All right.

37:48.767 --> 37:53.101
Time served plus ten years probation,
agreement she does not leave the state.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.930
- What does that matter? She can...
- I'll take it.

37:56.024 --> 37:59.391
- No, wait, Kate...
- Give me something to sign, l'll sign.

37:59.486 --> 38:02.273
And then I walk out that back door.

38:02.364 --> 38:03.900
| just...

38:06.994 --> 38:08.484
| just want this to be over.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.538
[Melissa] I can do that.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.616
Ten years probation, and you stay put.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.375
l have a child.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.502
I'm not going anywhere.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.385
- [sirens blaring]
- [car door opens]

38:36.106 --> 38:38.313
- [car door closes]
- Hey.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.652
How did you know I'd be here?

38:46.241 --> 38:50.200
Your... lawyer gave me the heads-up.

38:51.788 --> 38:53.494
He owed me one.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.493
Thank you...

38:56.752 --> 38:58.162
...for saying what you did.

38:58.253 --> 38:59.789
[chuckles]

38:59.880 --> 39:01.290
You're welcome.

39:02.257 --> 39:05.670
You know, Jack, I've heard you say
that story so many times...

39:05.761 --> 39:08.377
...l'm starting to think you believe it.

39:11.266 --> 39:12.802
[sighs]

39:12.893 --> 39:17.136
| just... I just wanted to tell you
that what I said in there...

39:20.275 --> 39:21.435
...I didn't mean it.

39:29.076 --> 39:32.068
You want to follow me?
Come by for a visit?

39:33.580 --> 39:35.741
Uh... [exhales]

39:35.832 --> 39:38.960
I actually have to get over
to the hospital.

39:39.836 --> 39:44.876
But... maybe you and I can grab
some coffee together or something.

39:51.306 --> 39:54.013
I know why you don't
want to see my baby, Jack.

39:56.353 --> 40:00.437
But until you do, until you want to...

40:02.693 --> 40:06.185
...there's no you and me
going for coffee.

40:08.574 --> 40:09.939
But, um...

40:11.410 --> 40:13.571
...if at any time
you change your mind,

40:13.662 --> 40:16.153
- come and see us.
- Yeah.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.080
OK.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.263
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:32.347 --> 40:34.133
[car starts]

41:16.767 --> 41:18.052
Hello?

41:18.894 --> 41:21.556
Kate. I'm so glad you're back.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.687
[sighs]

41:24.775 --> 41:27.938
- He missed you so much.
- Did you keep him away from the TV?

41:28.028 --> 41:29.359
Absolutely.

41:30.405 --> 41:32.111
| just put him down for a nap.

41:55.681 --> 41:57.797
[whispers] Hey, buddy.

41:57.891 --> 41:59.256
Hey.

41:59.351 --> 42:02.468
- [ yawns]
- [chuckles]

42:06.525 --> 42:07.640
Hey.

42:09.820 --> 42:11.105
Hi, Mommy.

42:12.364 --> 42:13.570
[sighs]

42:14.908 --> 42:16.739
Hi, Aaron.
