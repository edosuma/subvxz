WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:04.338
BRYAN:
No one gives you a handbook
on how to be a parent.

00:04.372 --> 00:08.542
You just arrive home one day
with a tiny, lovable blob

00:08.576 --> 00:09.877
and figure it out on your own.
(whimpering)

00:09.910 --> 00:12.213
Oh, oh, oh.
(gasps)

00:12.246 --> 00:14.882
Oh, who's the baby?
Who's there?

00:14.915 --> 00:17.385
Pets, like our little
Harvey Milkbone,

00:17.418 --> 00:19.887
are training wheels
for raising a baby.
(chew toy squeaking)

00:19.920 --> 00:22.056
They give you a glimpse into
what your life will be like

00:22.090 --> 00:23.057
with an infant.
Oh!

00:23.091 --> 00:25.059
You got him a present.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.427
Like other parents,

00:26.460 --> 00:28.562
we watched our new baby,
riveted

00:28.596 --> 00:30.598
for hours, while he played
in his crib.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.600
(barking)

00:32.633 --> 00:34.602
(whining)

00:34.635 --> 00:36.637
(barking)

00:39.940 --> 00:43.277
We struggled
through sleepless nights.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.313
(Harvey whining)

00:46.414 --> 00:48.082
(angry muttering)

00:48.116 --> 00:51.419
And we nearly exploded with joy

00:51.452 --> 00:53.387
when he uttered
his very first word.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.122
(barks)
(gasps)

00:54.155 --> 00:55.356
Was that "Daddy"?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.091
I heard "Papa."
Oh.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.760
I heard "crazy gay men."
(barks)

00:59.793 --> 01:02.630
And after months
of poop and tears

01:02.663 --> 01:06.134
and countless chewed-up,
hand-cobbled Italian Oxfords,

01:06.167 --> 01:10.771
we achieved the sweetest reward
any parent can ever hope for:

01:10.804 --> 01:12.440
a full night's sleep.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.575
(whining)

01:14.608 --> 01:16.910
BOTH:
Your turn.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.147
(David groans)
Well...

01:19.180 --> 01:21.115
almost a full night's sleep.

01:21.149 --> 01:23.083
Becoming doggy daddies
taught us

01:23.117 --> 01:25.419
how to love something
outside ourselves,

01:25.453 --> 01:28.055
and isn't that what
true parenting is all about?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.623
Okay.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.325
Smelly, how about you,
you want any of this?

01:31.359 --> 01:32.993
(barks)
No? All right.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.469
(knocking)
Ah, come in, Ms. Clemmons.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.137
Just listening
to a sixth grader's

01:43.171 --> 01:46.307
confiscated iPod. That's how
assistant principals stay hip.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.143
(chuckles)
Somebody's gonna learn
how to Dougie.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.279
Ooh. (chuckles)
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.281
I was waiting on
my ex-husband, but

01:53.314 --> 01:55.616
he didn't show, which isn't
a surprise to me or to the judge

01:55.649 --> 01:57.151
who gave me full
custody of Shania.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.687
Uh, I'm oversharing.
I overshare when I'm hot and...

01:59.720 --> 02:01.655
it's hot.
Do you smell pita chips?

02:01.689 --> 02:02.790
No.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.125
No? My pregnancy hormones

02:05.159 --> 02:07.328
are giving me a super
strong sense of smell,

02:07.361 --> 02:09.830
amongst some
other crazy feelings.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.299
Don't ever get pregnant.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.000
Can I offer you some water?

02:13.033 --> 02:14.302
Mmm. Yes, please.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.707
(upbeat music begins playing)

02:19.740 --> 02:21.175
(water pouring)

02:21.209 --> 02:24.478
* Let's get sexy in here,
in here *

02:24.512 --> 02:27.348
* Let's, let's, let's
let's get sexy in here *

02:27.381 --> 02:30.218
* Ah, I know you feel it

02:30.251 --> 02:34.355
* Sex, sex, sex, sexy

02:34.388 --> 02:36.657
* Sex, sex, sex, sexy

02:36.690 --> 02:38.359
* You're making me feel

02:38.392 --> 02:42.062
* Sex, sex, sex, sexy

02:42.095 --> 02:45.199
I've had some complaints
about... Shania.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.701
Who cares?

02:47.735 --> 02:49.870
* Feel, ah, feel, ah.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.038
(music stops)

02:51.071 --> 02:52.373
I'm sorry. Uh...

02:52.406 --> 02:54.041
(chuckles)
what did she do?

02:54.074 --> 02:55.709
Well, apparently she has

02:55.743 --> 02:58.512
an unusual fixation
with a British actress

02:58.546 --> 03:00.248
from the Harry Potter movies.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.082
Her name is, uh,

03:02.115 --> 03:03.417
Maggie Smith?

03:03.451 --> 03:04.752
Yeah.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.187
Wingardium Leviosa.

03:07.221 --> 03:10.358
Girl, I am a Christian woman.
I cannot abide your witchcraft.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.260
Muggle.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.728
What the hell
did you just call me?!

03:16.864 --> 03:20.401
Shania has been doing her Maggie
Smith impression for months.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.870
She loves her.
Says she's the greatest...

03:22.903 --> 03:26.607
...actress of her generation.
Maybe of all time.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.410
My favorite thing about her
is that she always plays

03:29.443 --> 03:31.879
the same role:
snooty British lady.

03:31.912 --> 03:35.783
Watching Dame
Maggie Smith is
very reassuring.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.451
It's like no matter
which country

03:37.485 --> 03:39.052
you eat McDonald's
fries in,

03:39.086 --> 03:41.221
they taste exactly the same.

03:41.255 --> 03:44.758
I know it's a little strange,
but no harm, no foul, right?

03:44.792 --> 03:47.428
Mm. Well, today,
things went afoul.

03:47.461 --> 03:50.964
By the turn
of the century in England,

03:50.998 --> 03:53.601
the working class grew
increasingly hostile

03:53.634 --> 03:57.738
toward the oppressive nature
of the British aristocracy.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.474
(British accent):
I beg your pardon,
you hobbledy-hoy!

04:00.508 --> 04:02.410
Shania, you need to have a seat.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.446
You will address me as
Lady Grantham of Downton Abbey,

04:05.479 --> 04:07.615
or better yet, not at all.

04:07.648 --> 04:11.285
And I will not sit on these
vulgar middle-class chairs

04:11.319 --> 04:13.787
designed as an insult
to one's coccyx.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.790
Now, who's joining me
for high tea?

04:17.658 --> 04:20.160
Shania's disrupting class,

04:20.193 --> 04:21.429
and there will be serious
consequences

04:21.462 --> 04:22.663
if it happens again.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.165
I am so sorry.
I'll make sure it doesn't.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.768
Great. Hey, more water?

04:27.801 --> 04:29.803
(music resumes playing)

04:29.837 --> 04:33.941
* Sex, sex, sex, sexy,
you're making me feel, ah. *

04:33.974 --> 04:37.778
Sawyer on the 18th hole,
Pebble Beach.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.447
Wind strong to the west.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.149
David?!
Oh, come on! I hooked it.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.951
Hit some guy
in the gallery.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.486
Uhp, he's dead. What's up, Bry?

04:45.519 --> 04:47.488
Something's wrong with Harvey.
Please call 911.

04:47.521 --> 04:51.158
Oh, you mean 911 for dogs,
with the little doggy operator?

04:51.191 --> 04:53.794
I can tell by your tone
there is no such thing.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.796
He threw up on the bath mat.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.631
So? Dogs do that.
Don't you, boy? Yes.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.166
And then sometimes
you eat it afterwards.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.334
We're not talking

05:00.368 --> 05:02.035
about Courtney Love.
We're talking about our puppy.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.204
We have to take him
to the vet today.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.706
(groans)
Please take him to the vet.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.676
I will make it worth your while.
I will do anything you want.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.378
Really?
Yeah.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.179
Anything?
Yeah.

05:12.212 --> 05:15.215
Okay, I want you to watch
The Hobbit with me.
Oh, why?!

05:15.248 --> 05:16.684
And I don't want you
to check your phone

05:16.717 --> 05:18.452
and I want no long anecdotes
about how Ian McKellan

05:18.486 --> 05:19.687
came on to you
at the car wash.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.355
But that really happened.
Oh, God.

05:21.389 --> 05:24.191
We both reached for the same
piÃ±a colada-scented
air freshener.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.394
Okay, please stop.
I'll do it.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.496
He was such a good kisser.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.899
GOLDIE:
First of all, you will have
no screen time or TV for a week.

05:31.932 --> 05:35.836
Especially this Downtown Abby
or whatever her name is.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.338
(British accent):
The name-- and you'd be wise
not to forget it--

05:38.372 --> 05:40.508
is Countess Violet Crawley.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.377
And your threats of punishment
are as empty as your dowry,

05:43.411 --> 05:46.079
judging by your absurdly
thick knuckles.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.015
What? You...!

05:48.048 --> 05:49.683
(knocking)
Shania...

05:49.717 --> 05:53.020
Oh, hey, Clay!
What's up?!

05:53.053 --> 05:54.588
You're only, what,
four hours late

05:54.622 --> 05:56.056
for the parent-teacher
conference?

05:56.089 --> 05:57.691
That's almost on time
for you.

05:57.725 --> 06:01.261
Come on, Goldie, I'm late
'cause I was at the gym.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.063
I despise everything late.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.766
From payments to trains
to the late Charles Dickens.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.402
Always writing
about the wretched poor.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.370
Monkey, why are you pretending
to be Sharon Osbourne?

06:10.404 --> 06:13.407
How dare you!
I'm the Dowager Countess,

06:13.441 --> 06:15.075
you lowly son of a laundry maid!

06:15.108 --> 06:16.610
This is why she got in trouble.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.912
But don't worry. I'll take care
of it, like everything else.

06:18.946 --> 06:22.450
No. Don't ever disrespect
me or your mother again.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.217
And lose the costume.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.453
I hate the British.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.755
Clay, it's okay
if she wears...

06:27.788 --> 06:28.922
No, it's not okay.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.892
It's a bigger thing.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.594
She's trying
to escape reality

06:33.627 --> 06:34.762
'cause reality hurts

06:34.795 --> 06:36.296
when the whole family
isn't together.

06:38.432 --> 06:42.803
Shania, I just want you to be
you, 'cause you're awesome.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.740
But if you have to pretend
to be someone else,

06:46.774 --> 06:50.110
at least have it be an American,
all right?

06:50.143 --> 06:51.579
Be, uh, be Taylor Swift.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.813
Oh, I like that!

06:59.787 --> 07:02.490
Oh, no! I've been dumped again!

07:02.523 --> 07:05.659
I'll write a song about it,
ignoring the fact

07:05.693 --> 07:09.329
that I'm the common denominator
in all my failed relationships!

07:09.362 --> 07:10.798
Yeah.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.667
Clay, how'd you like
to stay for dinner?

07:13.701 --> 07:16.303
I'd love that.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.171
Hmm.

07:18.205 --> 07:22.309
Our two hearts are like one
super big heart.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.812
Flynn, are you crying?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.480
He's not crying!

07:26.514 --> 07:27.648
Cut!
(bell rings)

07:27.681 --> 07:29.016
This is so frustrating.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.184
It's the second take
and he's still not getting it.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.520
I need him to weep.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.121
(phone buzzes)

07:34.154 --> 07:36.289
Oh.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.526
Hey, David, honey,
I can't talk right now.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.427
We're right in the middle
of a scene.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.795
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
slow down, slow down.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.363
What happened to Harvey?

07:43.396 --> 07:44.865
Oh, there's
my little baby.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.100
Are you okay?
Did they do a blood panel?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.502
They don't always do that.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.437
You have to ask for that,
you know.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.340
Has the vet been in here yet?
Why did they feed him a banana?

07:53.373 --> 07:54.675
Okay, relax.
We saw the vet.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.511
They drew blood.
She did a full abdominal X-ray.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.379
And I ate the banana.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.549
Okay, right off the bat,
I'd just like to say

08:01.582 --> 08:03.851
I will not be looking at
any more Christmas photos

08:03.884 --> 08:05.385
of pets wearing
reindeer antlers.

08:05.418 --> 08:06.687
David, you show
her those?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.522
That being said, let's
check out the X-rays.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.723
Okay.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.191
Did the blood panel
come back yet?

08:11.224 --> 08:13.527
It did. But that's not
what I'm worried about.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.162
This is your dog's stomach.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.397
As you can see, Harvey's
abdomen is very distended.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.000
Now, we can't tell for sure,
but it might be starting

08:20.033 --> 08:21.368
to twist around
the digestive tract.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.070
I'd like to decompress
the stomach,

08:23.103 --> 08:24.171
and then operate immediately.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.238
Whatever you need
to do, Doctor.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.306
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.041
I don't want you
to just cut into him.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.710
Bloat is very serious.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.244
Yes, but it might not be bloat.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.046
I mean, you just said
the X-rays were inconclusive.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.214
Couldn't we just give him

08:34.247 --> 08:36.183
some medication,
maybe reduce the gas?

08:36.216 --> 08:38.218
Look, I've got a cat
with six pennies in

08:38.251 --> 08:40.053
it's gut and a labradoodle
on suicide watch after

08:40.087 --> 08:41.889
I snip-snipped
the only balls he didn't chew.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.924
You two figure out
what you want to do.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.192
Let me know what you decide.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.594
Of course.
Thank you, Doctor.

08:46.627 --> 08:50.097
David, I don't want
to just cut into him.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.265
Well, if we don't, it could get
serious very fast.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.267
No, David, we're gonna
give him some medicine,

08:54.301 --> 08:56.570
we're gonna let him relax,
and then we're gonna take
another X-ray.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.171
And, Harvey, honey,
when you're back there,

08:58.205 --> 09:00.574
please promise me
you will not speak
to that labradoodle,

09:00.608 --> 09:03.911
because you do not need
that kind of negativity
in your life right now.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.414
(door closes)

09:07.447 --> 09:08.916
She's fast asleep.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.118
Aw. What did you read to her?

09:11.151 --> 09:13.086
Oh, no, she read to me.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.122
Some book about the
future called 1984.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.025
Which is weird,
'cause you and me,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.593
we weren't even born then.

09:19.627 --> 09:20.728
No.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.929
Hey, you okay?

09:21.962 --> 09:24.231
Oh, yeah.
Just a little kink.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.266
I was driving yesterday

09:26.299 --> 09:28.401
and rubbernecked
to stare at a barefoot hooker.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.807
Scooch.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.715
(music begins playing)

09:41.749 --> 09:45.252
* Let's get sexy in here,
in here *

09:45.285 --> 09:46.754
* That's how you make me feel

09:46.787 --> 09:49.489
* Ah... ah, I know you feel it

09:49.522 --> 09:52.159
* Sex, sex, sex, sexy,
that's how you make me feel *

09:52.192 --> 09:56.630
* Sex, sex, sex, sexy,
you're making me feel *

09:56.664 --> 09:59.299
Okay, now tell
that baby to scooch.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.668
I'm coming in.

10:00.701 --> 10:05.005
* Sex, sex, sex, sexy,
you're making me feel *

10:05.038 --> 10:06.807
* Feel, ah, feel, ah.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.914
Hey, Bry, I lost two pounds.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.415
That's 14 in
dog pounds.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.084
That's not how that works.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.285
We didn't wait here all night

10:18.318 --> 10:20.187
so we could mess around
with a scale.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.724
We're here to make sure our baby
gets the treatment he needs.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.927
Excuse me.
It's-it's been ten minutes.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.829
Could you give my dog
the medicine, please?

10:28.862 --> 10:29.997
Mr. Collins, we're going to.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.098
Oh, good. Go ahead.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.499
In just a few minutes.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.668
Well-well, please,
it's-it's been ten minutes.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.169
It's-it's been ten minutes.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.806
I-I don't, I don't know why
he has to have this pain.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.607
Sir, he's not my patient.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.643
It's-it's time for his medicine,
do you understand?!

10:43.677 --> 10:44.812
Do something.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.147
All he had to do was hold out
for ten minutes,

10:47.180 --> 10:48.381
and it's been ten minutes!

10:48.415 --> 10:50.650
My dog is in pain!
My dog is in pain!

10:50.684 --> 10:53.353
Give him the medicine,
do you understand?!

10:53.386 --> 10:55.655
Give my dog the medicine!

11:00.694 --> 11:02.863
Thank you very much.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.231
Thank you.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.665
That's good.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.534
Now let's do another scene
from Terms of Endearment.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.302
Ooh, how about the one
where Shirley MacLaine rides

11:09.336 --> 11:10.537
in the Corvette
with Jack Nicholson?

11:10.570 --> 11:13.306
You joke, but I could.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.342
(Goldie sobbing)

11:16.910 --> 11:18.879
Clay,

11:18.912 --> 11:19.980
wake up.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.681
Mm-hmm.
Something's wrong.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.983
I have cramps

11:23.016 --> 11:24.151
and pains.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.886
I think I have to
call Bryan and David.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.888
Okay... okay.
Oh, my God, what
am I going to do?

11:27.921 --> 11:29.489
Hey, hey, ev-everything's
gonna be good, all right?

11:29.522 --> 11:30.657
I'm right here.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.992
I'm scared.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.061
Okay.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.695
Uh,

11:35.729 --> 11:36.897
we'll drop Shania
off at Nana's

11:36.930 --> 11:38.165
on the way to
the hospital.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.333
I'm gonna take care of
you, baby, all right?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.169
Mm-hmm.
Come on, come on.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.336
(groans)

11:43.370 --> 11:45.038
Take it slow.
(grunts)

11:45.072 --> 11:46.339
(meows)

11:46.373 --> 11:48.008
What's wrong with your kitty?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.242
He's not mine.

11:49.276 --> 11:52.345
He ate my mouse
and I want the body back.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.513
Closure.
(yowls)

11:53.546 --> 11:55.749
(bird squawks)

11:57.384 --> 11:59.352
Hello.
What's going
on with him?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.789
He hasn't been eating.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.390
Something's got him agitated.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.391
Who's your daddy?

12:04.424 --> 12:05.392
Pound that butt.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.194
Take it all.
Fill me up.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.729
Also there are
some language issues.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.234
Hey.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.735
You can call off
the candlelight vigil.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.637
Your pooch is fine.
Thank God.

12:17.670 --> 12:20.040
He had excessive air
in his GI tract.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.109
So, gas?
Yup.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.276
We're gonna keep him
overnight,

12:23.310 --> 12:24.311
make sure
the swelling goes down.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.545
He'll be good to go
in the morning.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.613
Thank you.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.615
Mr. Lecompte,
we're ready for your cat.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.650
(yowls)

12:32.786 --> 12:35.222
I can't believe I was going
to let them do that surgery.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.057
Oh, honey, you just wanted
Harvey to be better.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.225
It's okay.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.260
No, it's not okay,
I reacted too fast.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.762
What, what if
that was our son?

12:42.796 --> 12:44.832
David, I could have
just as easily been wrong.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.433
I knew that I wasn't.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.600
(phone chimes)

12:47.634 --> 12:51.071
Oh... oh.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.272
This is Dr. Sawyer.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.774
What?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.409
Oh, my God.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.744
Okay, we'll be
right there.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.248
It's Goldie; she's
in the hospital.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.116
Goldie, Goldie,

13:03.150 --> 13:04.952
are you all right?
BRYAN:
How's the baby?

13:04.985 --> 13:06.086
What did the doctor say?

13:06.119 --> 13:07.787
I don't know,
they're running some tests.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.289
Okay.
Guys, I'm so scared.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.024
I was having cramps and pains.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.625
DAVID:
Okay, let's just wait
to hear what the doctor

13:12.659 --> 13:14.928
has to say, okay? This could be
any number of things.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.429
It's my fault.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.797
Me and Goldie--
we, uh,

13:17.831 --> 13:19.199
we kind of,

13:19.232 --> 13:21.534
you know, we...

13:21.568 --> 13:22.635
We had sex.

13:22.669 --> 13:23.837
And if I broke
your baby,

13:23.871 --> 13:26.206
I promise I'm gonna make
you guys a new one.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.641
GOLDIE:
It's no one's fault,
and Clay's been great.

13:28.675 --> 13:29.776
He's been with me
the whole time.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.112
DOCTOR:
Okay, it's good news.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.514
Looks like it's just a case
of Braxton Hicks.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.350
(sighs)
Unless that is a duet
between Grammy sensation Toni

13:37.384 --> 13:39.219
and fifth season
American Idol winner Taylor,

13:39.252 --> 13:40.287
I am unfamiliar.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.288
DAVID:
It's very normal

13:41.321 --> 13:42.289
in pregnancy,

13:42.322 --> 13:43.523
and although
I'm sure it was

13:43.556 --> 13:44.791
scary for
you, Goldie,

13:44.824 --> 13:47.727
it just means that the uterus
is getting ready to push.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.996
Okay.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.063
But Goldie can't push yet.
The baby

13:50.097 --> 13:51.164
is only 29 weeks--
he's not ready.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.232
Your baby's fine.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.968
Rest of the pregnancy
should be uneventful.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.736
(chuckles)

13:56.769 --> 13:58.571
BRYAN:
I don't know what

13:58.605 --> 14:00.007
I would have done if something
happened to our baby.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.242
That was the scariest moment
of my life,

14:02.275 --> 14:04.377
next to seeing my mom get
out of the bathtub.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.881
(phone buzzing)

14:07.915 --> 14:09.883
What?
Oh, it's the vet.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.584
Oh, get it.
Bryan Collins.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.087
I'm sorry,
what, now?

14:14.121 --> 14:16.323
David.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.390
Yeah.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.526
Harvey Milkbone died.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.873
Harvey.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.709
I just don't
get it, Bry.

14:36.743 --> 14:40.914
He was up, he was walking
around, and then a car hits him?

14:40.948 --> 14:43.283
They take him out for
a walk, he gets loose,

14:43.316 --> 14:44.884
and a car hits him.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.954
It just doesn't--
I-I just can't...

14:46.987 --> 14:48.121
Honey, we can't keep going

14:48.155 --> 14:50.057
over and over this,
trying to make sense of it.

14:50.090 --> 14:53.927
It was just a random,
freakish thing.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.695
(sighs)

14:55.728 --> 14:57.597
I just can't help thinking,

14:57.630 --> 15:00.067
if we'd brought him home
last night, he'd still be here.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.901
Yeah, but we don't know
what would have happened.

15:01.935 --> 15:02.902
Isn't that
the first thing

15:02.936 --> 15:04.304
they teach you
in medical school--

15:04.337 --> 15:06.940
that you can do
all the right things,

15:06.974 --> 15:10.310
but sometimes
patients just die?

15:10.343 --> 15:12.912
Yeah, but it still hurts.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.414
I know.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.448
It's just...

15:16.449 --> 15:19.086
I had this whole picture
in my mind

15:19.119 --> 15:21.254
of me and our boy

15:21.288 --> 15:23.991
playing ball in the park
with Harvey Milkbone.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.161
(voice breaking):
And now our boy's
never gonna know Harvey.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.197
Oh, honey.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.433
This can never
happen to our kid, okay?

15:33.466 --> 15:34.734
I mean it.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.970
I-I just can't go
through that, I can't.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.608
(knocking)

15:41.641 --> 15:43.276
(door opens)

15:43.310 --> 15:44.644
Shania's here with
Goldie and Clay,

15:44.677 --> 15:47.114
and she has something
she wants to say to you.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.548
ROCKY:
Come on.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.187
Hey. How
you feeling?

15:54.221 --> 15:55.955
Much better.
Good.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.424
We told Shania

15:57.457 --> 15:58.758
what happened, and she
wanted to come over

15:58.791 --> 16:00.027
right away to
cheer you guys up.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.828
Oh...

16:03.196 --> 16:04.464
(British accent):
Hello.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.133
I bring the Lord's
thoughts and prayers

16:06.166 --> 16:07.667
to you in this
time of need.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.136
CLAY:
You know,

16:09.169 --> 16:10.537
she almost got kicked
out of school

16:10.570 --> 16:12.505
for dressing up like
this Maggie Smith lady.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.642
But seeing as your dog
got totally creamed,

16:15.675 --> 16:17.510
I made an exception
for you guys.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.179
BRYAN:
Oh, my God,

16:19.212 --> 16:20.647
you're the
Mother Superior

16:20.680 --> 16:22.182
from Sister Act.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.883
Or Sister Act 2:
Back in the Habit.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.685
My dear boys,

16:25.718 --> 16:27.854
loss is never easy.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.522
But have faith.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.324
The light of
the angels shines

16:31.358 --> 16:33.326
brightly upon
Harvey Milkbone.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.227
(laughs)

16:34.261 --> 16:35.395
You shall carry him

16:35.428 --> 16:36.563
in your hearts
forever.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.165
Amen.
Come here.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.068
Oh, thank you.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.837
Oh, hey, Bryan.
Great to see you.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.673
Hi, Father.
Wait, you can see me?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.841
Just the poofy part
of your hair.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.510
Oh.
You should
also know

16:50.543 --> 16:51.678
this confession's being recorded

16:51.711 --> 16:52.879
for quality assurance purposes.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.181
My puppy died.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.349
Oh, boy.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.517
And I know
you're gonna say

16:57.550 --> 16:58.685
he'll always be
in my heart.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.853
But I don't want him
in my heart.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.922
No, you want him in your lap,

17:02.955 --> 17:04.391
licking your face.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.359
What kind of god

17:06.393 --> 17:08.361
lets a nine-month-old
puppy get killed?

17:08.395 --> 17:09.596
Are you mad at God, Bryan?

17:09.629 --> 17:11.531
Hells yes, I'm mad at God.
Well, then,
tell him.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.765
He's a big boy,

17:12.799 --> 17:13.933
he can take it.

17:13.966 --> 17:15.102
Why are you mad?

17:15.135 --> 17:16.703
Well, because he allows

17:16.736 --> 17:18.438
such incredible suffering
in the world.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.373
Look...

17:20.407 --> 17:21.608
I don't want to trivialize

17:21.641 --> 17:23.443
the pain of your dog's death.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.711
But the apostle Paul?

17:24.744 --> 17:27.046
He suffered through
beatings, stonings,

17:27.080 --> 17:28.581
shipwrecks, imprisonments,

17:28.615 --> 17:29.582
homelessness,

17:29.616 --> 17:31.951
and all of that without Wi-Fi.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.421
It sounds like
you're trivializing it.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.755
(sighs)

17:35.788 --> 17:37.790
I'm just saying...

17:37.824 --> 17:39.892
without suffering,

17:39.926 --> 17:42.295
joy and happiness
become commonplace.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.598
Like it or not,
suffering and loss

17:45.632 --> 17:48.235
are what teach us to appreciate
life's blessings.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.738
I'm scared, Father.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.773
(sniffles)

17:55.074 --> 17:56.209
I love Harvey.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.745
I, uh...

17:58.778 --> 18:01.448
I loved him very much.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.749
And losing him hurts.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.854
What if, next, God wanted
to take my baby?

18:11.324 --> 18:12.925
Or David?

18:12.959 --> 18:15.128
Or... Goldie, or Shania,

18:15.162 --> 18:16.929
or anybody that I love?

18:17.964 --> 18:19.332
Wow.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.768
Just listen to the list of
people God has put in your life.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.504
All of them here
to help you

18:24.537 --> 18:26.105
through a time
like this.

18:27.807 --> 18:28.941
Look, Bryan.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.843
The pain that
you're feeling now,

18:30.877 --> 18:32.912
as horrible
as it is,

18:32.945 --> 18:33.946
will eventually

18:33.980 --> 18:36.816
be replaced by moments
of great joy.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.017
Like the arrival

18:38.050 --> 18:40.187
of your baby.
(exhales)

18:40.220 --> 18:41.354
Of course, someday

18:41.388 --> 18:42.489
he, too, will
bring you pain.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.791
Come see me
when he's a teenager,

18:44.824 --> 18:47.126
and knocks up some
professional hula-hooper

18:47.160 --> 18:48.528
he just met at Burning Man.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.696
(laughs)

18:49.729 --> 18:51.831
(sniffles)

18:51.864 --> 18:53.933
So you're saying we can't open
ourselves up to love

18:53.966 --> 18:56.135
without opening ourselves
up to pain?

18:56.169 --> 18:58.171
You got it, kid.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.173
Joy and pain,

19:00.207 --> 19:01.508
sunshine and rain.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.844
I'll miss him, Father.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.615
Do you think we could, uh...

19:08.648 --> 19:10.217
we could say a prayer for him,

19:10.250 --> 19:12.185
wherever he is, that he's okay?

19:12.219 --> 19:13.853
Of course.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.133
(sighs)

19:27.166 --> 19:28.968
Mom, I'll be
in my room

19:29.001 --> 19:31.170
binge-watching Downton
season one.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.705
Okay.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.808
Aren't you, uh...

19:35.842 --> 19:37.009
coming in?

19:38.778 --> 19:40.980
Goldie...

19:41.013 --> 19:42.349
I've been a bad guy.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.217
I lied,

19:44.251 --> 19:46.486
and I cheated,

19:46.519 --> 19:48.187
and... (sighs)

19:48.221 --> 19:49.522
I caused you tons of pain.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.258
But when
I saw you

19:51.291 --> 19:53.593
hurting last night,
it made me realize that

19:53.626 --> 19:57.364
if anything ever
happened to you...

19:57.397 --> 19:58.931
I'd feel like my life was over.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.068
I'm gonna make up

20:02.101 --> 20:04.504
for all the bad things
I did to you.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.474
You don't have to believe me
yet, just watch.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.118
DAVID:
Love isn't always easy.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.254
Sometimes it can really throw
you for a loop.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.957
The minute you start
to love something,

20:24.991 --> 20:27.594
you accept the risk
that someday

20:27.627 --> 20:29.862
it might not be there.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.932
But with the sadness
of lost love,

20:32.965 --> 20:35.535
it's important to treasure
all the wonderful memories

20:35.568 --> 20:37.904
you shared together.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.606
BRYAN:
We had hoped that our puppy

20:39.639 --> 20:40.907
would be like training wheels

20:40.940 --> 20:42.775
for raising a baby,
and he was.

20:42.809 --> 20:46.112
But he also taught us
about love.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.780
How exciting it could be,

20:47.814 --> 20:49.248
and how heartbreaking.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.594
So now, the training wheels

21:01.628 --> 21:04.531
have come off,
and we're still pretty wobbly.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.305
But the truth is,

21:12.339 --> 21:13.906
despite the bumps in the road,

21:13.940 --> 21:15.975
I think we're
a lot more prepared

21:16.008 --> 21:17.744
to handle the ride.
