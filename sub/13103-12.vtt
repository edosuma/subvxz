00:01.752 --> 00:04.243
This is your rookie evaluation form--

00:04.922 --> 00:06.833
your report card.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.582
It says your training officer
thinks that you're a good cop.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.129
It says one day that he thinks
you're gonna be a great cop.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.387
This is an excellent evaluation, McNally.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.722
Let me talk you through the categories--

00:21.980 --> 00:25.268
problem solving, report writing, uniform--

00:25.734 --> 00:27.645
you got very high marks across the board.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.027
You're not smiling.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.153
I'm sorry. Um...

00:33.367 --> 00:34.777
I'm glad it's a good evaluation.

00:36.787 --> 00:37.822
It's just that...

00:37.871 --> 00:40.203
what happened tonight
really scared the hell out of me.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.661
It should. You had a rough shift.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.540
No, it's notjust this one shift, sir.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.542
It's every single shift.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.548
It's like it's all adding up.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.345
It's creeping up on me,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.552
and it just took today for me
to finally see it.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.591
See what?

01:01.645 --> 01:03.931
The cost of doing this job.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.063
(Dov) Any more intel yet?

01:11.113 --> 01:14.105
Negative, and we still don't know
if it's happening before or after shift.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.533
Uh, your tie is on crooked.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.820
I can't get this thing to sit right.

01:17.869 --> 01:20.702
Relax. They can't fire us for not knowing
how to tie a tie, right?

01:20.747 --> 01:22.783
The uniform makes the cop, okay?
Plus it's a clip-on.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.371
I don't know why you guys are so worried.
They're just evaluations.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.788
No, like, worst-case scenario--
you won't get cut loose.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.422
You'll still have to ride with your T.O.,

01:32.467 --> 01:35.709
or big dea|--you'|| get transferred
to another division.

01:35.762 --> 01:39.050
I cannot get transferred, okay?
I mean, this is my family.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.590
3 o'clock. Don't look.
I said don't look.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.179
He's holding yellow forms.
(copier beeps)

01:43.228 --> 01:44.388
What, you think those are them?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.895
Can you--
Honestly, can you relax?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.976
You're gonna know
what he says soon enough.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.353
Those are definitely them.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.859
(copier whirring)

01:55.115 --> 01:57.071
Hey, I think he forgot some.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.824
Well, we should probably take
those back to him right away.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.906
I mean, before somebody else
accidentally finds 'em.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.287
Okay, but we're not looking at them.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.914
"Diaz is great at following the rules,

02:05.959 --> 02:08.746
but he has to step up,
learn to think for himself."

02:08.795 --> 02:10.501
There's no way they're cutting me loose!

02:11.506 --> 02:13.007
See, I told you we shouldn't have read this.

02:13.050 --> 02:17.589
At least yours doesn't say, "I'm concerned
about Epstein's level of professionalism.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.629
He needs to take the job more seriously."

02:19.681 --> 02:22.764
I can't believe Oliver wrote this about me.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.595
Hey, there you guys are.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.226
Everything all right?

02:26.271 --> 02:27.431
- Yes, sir.
- Uh, yes, sir.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.938
Good. Listen, evaluations after shift tonight.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.484
So, uh, go ahead and spread the word.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.489
(door squeaks closed)

02:36.990 --> 02:38.230
So what do we do now?

02:38.283 --> 02:41.070
We got one last shift to serve, protect,

02:41.119 --> 02:42.404
and prove everybody else wrong.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.534
(hands slap)

02:44.206 --> 02:47.448
So then he says that he broke up
with the yoga instructor,

02:47.501 --> 02:50.288
and he wants to clean up his act.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.795
He wants to try again, and...
I mean, I don't know.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.707
Having him around
would make this job easier.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.171
But then there's Jerry, right?

02:59.388 --> 03:00.377
Right?

03:01.556 --> 03:03.342
Do I look like Oprah to you?

03:03.392 --> 03:05.474
You said you wanted me to distract you.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.352
Yeah, with something
that I'm interested in hearing.

03:12.192 --> 03:16.151
Well, you want to give me a heads-up
on my evaluation?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.027
Uh-huh.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.819
Does it say that, uh,

03:21.868 --> 03:25.406
you know, my childcare situation
has made me unreliable?

03:26.415 --> 03:28.076
Or that you question my priorities?

03:28.125 --> 03:31.663
Uh, would I be asking you
to stick a needle in my ass

03:31.712 --> 03:35.421
if I thought that a woman couldn't be
a single mom and a good cop?

03:37.426 --> 03:40.463
(phones ringing)

03:40.929 --> 03:43.090
- Hey.
- Hey, sunshine.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.220
Can I talk to you for a second?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.174
| see "sunshine" was a little off the mark.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.343
Look, you got nothing to worry about.
You're gonna get cut loose.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.978
- Yeah, well, it's actually about my dad.
- Is he okay?

03:52.023 --> 03:54.435
You know how he's been going
to those meetings every night this week?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.691
I went to go meet him there tonight,
and he didn't show up.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.102
I mean, what if something happened?

03:58.155 --> 03:59.520
Maybe he just went to another meeting.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.564
(P.A.) Detective Callaghan,
HQ on line four.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.574
(clears throat) Look, Andy, I'm sorry.
I have to take this, okay?

04:04.619 --> 04:05.608
I'm sure he's fine.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.421
It's a door, McNally.
You knock, it opens.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.004
- (Andy sighs)
- You all right?

04:18.049 --> 04:21.212
Yeah. Nothing a solid ten hours
on the job can't fix.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.546
Yeah, be careful with that.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.427
Putting on the uniform
to get away from your life

04:25.766 --> 04:27.347
makes it harder and harder
to take it off.

04:28.059 --> 04:31.267
Well, thank you for your concern,
but I have no problem taking it off.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.428
I mean...

04:34.274 --> 04:35.775
You know what I mean.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.561
Dad, where are you?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.230
I'm kind of freaking out a little.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.989
All right, pleasejust call me.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.556
I've never seen you do a proper
radio check before, Epstein.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.436
Did you and Diaz
switch bodies or something?

05:15.482 --> 05:17.222
I'm just trying to focus on the job.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.526
(Oliver) Oh.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.312
Did, uh...
(Dov clicks gun clip)

05:21.822 --> 05:24.780
uh, I sleep with you and | forgot to call?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.440
ljust want to do thejob right, sir.

05:26.952 --> 05:31.321
Mm. All right,
well, let's get right on to the food.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.123
- You get to choose today.
- Yes, sir.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.875
Falafel, burrito...
You want to go for a burger?

05:37.921 --> 05:40.253
- I'm not really hungry.
- And you call yourself a copper?

05:42.592 --> 05:45.459
(helicopter hovering)

05:45.512 --> 05:46.752
It's quiet tonight.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.425
Yeah. I'm just thinking.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.931
I meant the streets.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.269
It's Friday night. Should be busier.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.433
You're not worried aboutjinxing us?

05:58.525 --> 06:02.359
(scoffs) Listen, you wear this uniform
long enough, you'll see.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.689
The calls come when they come.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.322
No one's calling 911
just 'cause I said it was quiet.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.571
(woman on radio) All available units,
we've got a code 1. 911.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.318
My bad.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.873
Code 1 for a 911 call.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.497
Possible sudden death
at 216 Hillstreet Avenue.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.829
Victim is a teenage girl.
Witnesses are fleeing the scene.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.210
(siren wails)

06:20.255 --> 06:23.543
This is 1515. Show us en route.
Do you have any more info on the call?

06:23.592 --> 06:26.459
(woman on radio) No call back.
Stand by for the 911 patch.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.672
(girl on phone) Oh, my God.
We need an ambulance.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.714
This girl--oh, my God!
It looks like she’s dead!

06:31.766 --> 06:34.052
(gasping) / think she’s dead!

06:34.728 --> 06:36.389
(woman on radio)
EMS has arrived on scene.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.225
(siren whooping, tires screech)

06:44.446 --> 06:46.437
(sirens, police radio chatter)

06:47.032 --> 06:48.988
We need you to clear this area!

06:49.034 --> 06:51.150
Everybody, into the living room!

06:51.202 --> 06:53.158
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

06:53.204 --> 06:56.332
(Noelle) All cell phones in your pockets!
If I see 'em, I take 'em.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.831
(Andy)
Girls, I'm sorry. You gotta go.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.833
Thank you.
Whose party is this?

07:00.879 --> 07:02.870
(Andy)
Come on. Somebody help him up.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.000
You know this girl?

07:05.050 --> 07:06.711
I've never seen her before in my life.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.966
So what's she doing at your party?

07:08.011 --> 07:10.252
Uh, having a good time
like everybody else.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.887
Do your parents know
that you're having this party?

07:12.933 --> 07:16.721
Uh, they're in London.
That's in England.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.056
Oh, well, then I guess
there'll be no one around

07:19.105 --> 07:20.766
to bail your funny ass out ofjail.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.023
I really don't know who she is, ma'am.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.226
That's what I thought.
In the living room.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.563
(EMS tech) She's ice cold.
We've already pronounced her.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.907
Looks like she broke her neck
when she hit the ground.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.204
Jumped or pushed?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.111
That's your job.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.371
Thanks.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.000
This is McNally.
We need C.|.B. here.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.251
The victim's been pronounced.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.832
(police radio chatter)

07:44.881 --> 07:46.212
Hey, did you get her name?

07:46.257 --> 07:49.590
No. Anybody who's
sober enough to remember

07:49.636 --> 07:50.921
ran off when they heard the sirens.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.087
(officer)
Hey! Put that beer down!

07:53.139 --> 07:54.128
Here we go.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.093
(officer)
All of you, take a step back.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.473
Her name is Ashley Kennedy.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.477
(officer) Hey, hey, hey,
stand inside the living room.

08:00.522 --> 08:01.682
This is not her lD.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.432
(officer) Keep it down in there!

08:05.485 --> 08:07.601
Tonight's not our night, McNally.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.771
Yeah, there's gotta be some reason why
she has this ID in her back pocket.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.191
I say we go to this address
and see who opens the door.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.326
Uh, I say we let the D's chase that.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.202
We gotta help lock this place down.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.784
Yeah, but there's more
than enough guys here.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.951
Karpenko, Day,
you're on the body.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.039
(man) You got it.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.666
All right, rookie, you take the lead.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.165
According to the logbook,

08:31.219 --> 08:33.301
Mr. Joseph signed in
at 0900 this morning.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.506
No breach of conditions so far.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.259
Okay, thanks.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.513
(cell phone rings)

08:42.188 --> 08:43.303
(ring)

08:44.399 --> 08:45.388
(beep)

08:45.734 --> 08:47.065
ls Leo all right?

08:47.235 --> 08:48.566
You said you were gonna
stay with him all night.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.522
Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna visit someone special.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.521
(slaps phone closed)

08:57.412 --> 08:58.868
I'm at work, Dex.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.239
For you--li|ies, your favorite.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.372
(Traci sighs)

09:05.045 --> 09:06.785
Now come on.
People get flowers at work all the time.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.624
Not cops.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.709
I wanted to see you in your uniform.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.044
Rob a bank.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.426
Look, Trace,
the more I hang outwith Leo,

09:15.472 --> 09:18.214
the more I realize what we're missing
not being a family.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.554
And don't we owe it to him
to see if we can make this work?

09:23.563 --> 09:24.598
(sighs)

09:24.647 --> 09:25.898
How about we start with breakfast?

09:28.276 --> 09:30.608
After your shift, just the three of us.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.066
Please get out of here.
Take your flowers.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.374
Ruiz, can you get everybody
into the dining room, please?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.539
Everybody, we need you
to move into the dining room!

09:52.592 --> 09:55.550
Into the dining room, please!
Follow Officer Ruiz.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.096
(Ruiz) You heard the man!
Right through here!

09:57.263 --> 09:58.548
(Gail) Oh, that's encouraging.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.010
These kids are graduating,
and they still can't spell.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.429
(Sam chuckles)

10:03.478 --> 10:05.594
Maybe they go to Spanish school.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.183
Voila.

10:09.484 --> 10:10.599
(man) Tell them to get back here.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.517
You guys, over here.
You two, over on the wall.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.395
Ma'am, over on the wall.
Put that beer down.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.733
You, hair, let's go.

10:16.783 --> 10:17.772
(Gail) Sir, you should see this!

10:19.452 --> 10:21.067
(Oliver) Okay, I want to see your le.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.077
- If your le belong to your older brother...
- What do you got?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.454
(Oliver) ...or sister,
go in the living room.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.909
This leads up to the roof.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.951
(police radio chatter,
helicopter hovering)

10:30.964 --> 10:32.829
Okay, well,
she must have fallen from here,

10:34.551 --> 10:36.132
'cause it's right over the backyard.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.129
So she's up here
because she wants a smoke,

10:41.224 --> 10:42.930
she needs some fresh air, what?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.638
You really think
she came out here by herself?

10:45.979 --> 10:49.597
I mean, you're at a party full of people,
and you climb out onto the roof alone?

10:49.983 --> 10:52.315
Well, teenagers are idiots.
Anything's possible.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.105
Maybe shejumped.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.395
Maybe.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.731
All right, there's too many people
coming and going down there.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.446
I want you in charge of that body
until the coroner comes.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.329
Well, I mean, I can take statements
and brief the detectives when they get here.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.114
You got a problem babysitting a body?

11:08.168 --> 11:11.126
No. Dead bodies are part of the job.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.411
Okay.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.877
- I mean look at us--
- (Oliver) Everybody, get out your le.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.632
putting up party decorations
while he deals with the witnesses.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.465
Well, maybe if I took myjob more seriously,
he'd let me question them.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.554
I'm the one who needs to step up.
Remember?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.885
Not if I step up first.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.095
Everybody, against the wall.
Everybody, line up. Make a line.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.510
I got questions, all right?

11:28.563 --> 11:30.554
- (vomits)
- Ohh!

11:36.362 --> 11:39.604
- Sir, I'd like to question the witnesses.
- Me, too.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.907
Well, look at 'em.
They're drunk, and they're freaked out.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.738
What makes you think
they're gonna talk to the two of you?

11:44.787 --> 11:46.243
I speak that language.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.660
Um, I could seize their cell phones,
you know, as evidence,

11:49.709 --> 11:51.870
and not give 'em back to them
until they start talking.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.330
(sighs)

11:53.379 --> 11:56.291
Well, the two of you better
make good on this, all right?

11:56.341 --> 11:58.798
We need these little nobs
to start talking right now.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.764
(officers speaking indistinctly)

12:30.208 --> 12:32.745
(dog barking in distance)

12:32.794 --> 12:35.786
(police radio chatter)

12:38.508 --> 12:40.965
(doorbell rings)

12:42.220 --> 12:44.632
McNally, are you here
to borrow a cup of sugar

12:44.681 --> 12:46.137
or do some investigating?

12:46.182 --> 12:48.343
I'm just trying to look friendly.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.304
Well, you look like a weirdo.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.968
Ashley Kennedy?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.272
Yes?

12:53.314 --> 12:55.771
l'm Officer Williams.
This is Officer McNally.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.102
Can we come in, please?

12:57.986 --> 12:59.192
Sure.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.821
Are your parents home?

13:03.866 --> 13:05.072
Uh, it'sjust my mom,

13:05.118 --> 13:07.404
but I shouldn't wake her unless it's important.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.614
Can you have a seat, please?

13:13.209 --> 13:17.043
Is there any reason why someone else
would be in possession of your identification?

13:18.006 --> 13:18.995
What do you mean?

13:19.048 --> 13:20.333
May | see your license, please?

13:22.218 --> 13:25.756
Okay, but I don't understand why.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.217
Um...

13:30.601 --> 13:31.590
it should be here.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.350
Could anyone have taken it?

13:34.272 --> 13:35.352
No.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.269
Well, actually, my little sister Julia

13:39.319 --> 13:41.776
asked if she could borrow it
a few days ago, but...

13:41.821 --> 13:44.153
I didn't give it to her, obviously.

13:44.699 --> 13:45.859
And where's Julia tonight?

13:45.908 --> 13:49.617
She's sleeping. She doesn't really
go out when mom's back.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.278
- Back?
- Go wake her up, please.

13:54.917 --> 13:55.952
Okay.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.709
This is exactly why I didn't want
to chase that lD here.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.000
- What are you doing?
- lfthat girl isn't in her room,

14:05.053 --> 14:07.260
this is gonna turn
into a death notification,

14:07.305 --> 14:08.511
and you're gonna do it.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.593
(lowers voice) What? Me?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.975
Look, they taught you how to do it
in the academy, right?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.430
Yeah, in a classroom.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.766
All right, look,
you--you sit 'em down,

14:17.815 --> 14:20.352
and you be sympathetic,
but don't drag it out.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.785
I think this is what you're looking for.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.535
This is the hardest thing
that we do in ourjob. All right?

14:40.588 --> 14:43.330
No matter how it goes, you're gonna
feel like you didn't do it right,

14:44.258 --> 14:45.509
that you didn't do enough.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.540
(door closes)

14:50.181 --> 14:51.546
You can do this, McNally.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.590
Julia's not in her room.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.759
What's going on?

14:57.230 --> 15:00.393
Um, ma'am, l'm Officer McNally,
and this is Officer Williams.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.065
Please have a seat.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.558
VVhy?

15:06.114 --> 15:08.196
- Is this Julia?
- Yeah.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.741
I'm really sorry to have to tell you this,

15:13.079 --> 15:14.444
but there's been an accident.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.072
Julia was at a party,
and she had a fall.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.082
(voice breaking)
Is she okay?

15:20.128 --> 15:24.246
Actually, she's...
She's not.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.586
I'm sorry, but she's dead.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.058
(camera shutter clicks)

15:38.104 --> 15:40.436
Excuse me, folks.
Excuse me.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.470
(police radio chatter)

15:43.443 --> 15:45.399
(speaking indistinctly)

15:45.445 --> 15:47.811
So, uh, they're almost done here.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.729
You can go in and help
with the witnesses.

15:49.782 --> 15:53.400
I should stay with her--
um, with the body--

15:53.453 --> 15:54.909
un-until they take it away.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.411
Okay. Fine with me.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.372
- (man) I think that's it.
- (2nd man) Okay, yeah.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.497
The coroner's already here.

16:01.711 --> 16:02.826
Yeah, we'll be right down.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.828
What was the cause of the fall?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.457
We're still investigating the incident.
It's really early.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.754
(voice breaking)
I want to see her.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.044
Well, you can see her as soon
as the investigation is complete.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.428
I want to see her now.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.714
I'm sorry, but we need to wait.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.894
You can'tjust come into our house
and tell us this crap!

16:18.936 --> 16:19.971
(mother) Shut up, Ashley!

16:20.521 --> 16:23.479
If the officer says we have to wait
to see the body, then we wait.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.855
"The body"?

16:25.401 --> 16:28.643
(sniffles) Mom, we're talking about Julia.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.937
(Ashley crying softly)

16:30.990 --> 16:32.776
How do you expect me
to believe she's dead

16:32.825 --> 16:33.905
if you won't let me see her?

16:33.951 --> 16:35.066
I saw her.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.115
It's definitely the girl in the photo.
I'm sorry.

16:40.374 --> 16:43.207
Look, is--is there anybody
that we can call--

16:43.836 --> 16:46.828
you know, some family
or maybe a pastor or something?

16:46.881 --> 16:49.623
No, there's no one to call.
There's no family,

16:49.675 --> 16:52.087
and my platoon's still over there.

16:53.429 --> 16:56.671
I'm the only one that got leave this time
because I've got kids.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.303
(crying)

17:05.858 --> 17:08.770
(telephone ringing,
indistinct conversations)

17:08.819 --> 17:11.276
(beeping)

17:11.989 --> 17:14.605
Hey. How are the prisoners this evening?

17:14.659 --> 17:16.650
More sleepy than hungry.
You want one?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.988
Mmm. Anything from you.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.369
- Ooh.
- (Traci chuckles)

17:20.414 --> 17:22.575
- Hey, just hang on.
- ljust have to touch--

17:22.625 --> 17:25.037
- Jerry.
- What's wrong?

17:27.171 --> 17:28.160
Flowers?

17:31.801 --> 17:34.042
Who'd throw away fresh flowers?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.173
Allergies, something?

17:37.640 --> 17:38.675
Lmes,huh?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.931
- A lot of people like lilies.
- Mm-hmm. There's no--

17:44.564 --> 17:45.804
There's no card.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.230
They're from Leo's dad.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.237
Yeah, but...
he came here...

17:59.287 --> 18:01.448
and he brought you a...
a bouquet?

18:01.497 --> 18:05.410
I'm trying to be civil to him,
Jerry, for Leo's sake.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.450
He's Leo's dad.

18:07.545 --> 18:10.412
Yeah, but these aren't
child support checks, Traci.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.251
These are...
These are flowers.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.257
Which is why they were in the trash.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.752
All right.

18:21.892 --> 18:25.555
You know, the guy couldn't even take
10 seconds to sign a card.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.489
We need to separate them,

18:40.620 --> 18:42.406
find out all that we can about Julia--

18:43.080 --> 18:45.571
who her friends were,
if she had a boyfriend,

18:45.625 --> 18:46.740
if she was depressed.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.123
Wait. Depressed?
Do you think it was a suicide?

18:51.172 --> 18:53.663
l have no idea, McNally.
That's why we need to ask.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.126
You want to take the mother?

18:56.093 --> 18:57.594
What do I even say?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.093
I mean, she obviously
doesn't want to talk to me.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.426
All right, take the sister.
Find out what she knows.

19:08.189 --> 19:11.431
Um, did Julia have a lot of friends?

19:12.360 --> 19:13.440
Please don't do that.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.106
Don't talk about her in the past tense.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.271
I'm sorry.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.524
I'm sure you probably
just want me to go away

19:21.577 --> 19:23.488
so that you and your mother
can grieve in peace.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.826
My mom's not waiting to grieve.
She's just like that now.

19:27.875 --> 19:32.118
Well, it was probably really hard for her
to be away from you guys so often.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.042
She wasn't always like this.

19:37.051 --> 19:40.760
When Julia and me were little
and she'd come back from her tour,

19:42.056 --> 19:43.637
she'd want us to sleep in her bed.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.892
It was the only way she could sleep,

19:48.521 --> 19:51.809
knowing we were close and safe.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.478
And now?

19:57.488 --> 19:58.477
(sniffles)

19:58.531 --> 20:00.442
Since she reenlisted, it's been different.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.074
She sleeps a lot now,

20:05.371 --> 20:06.656
stays locked in her room.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.321
T.C.O.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.583
(laughs) Totally checked out.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.666
That's what Julia and me call it.
(sniffles)

20:18.968 --> 20:20.959
I don't really know how to ask you this.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.339
Do you think Julia
would ever hurt herself?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.216
What?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.181
Ashley, if we're gonna find out
exactly what happened,

20:32.231 --> 20:33.812
I'm gonna need you to help me.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.604
She would never have done that to Mom.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.773
She just wouldn't have.

20:41.949 --> 20:42.938
(cell phone rings)

20:43.784 --> 20:45.024
(velcro rips)

20:45.286 --> 20:46.401
(ring)

20:47.913 --> 20:49.028
Who is it?

20:49.081 --> 20:52.073
Uh, it's... (closes phone)
It's just a personal call.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.665
Is that how it's gonna be from now on--

20:58.758 --> 21:00.248
every time the phone rings...

21:01.260 --> 21:04.172
(voice breaking)
hoping it's someone calling to say

21:04.221 --> 21:05.472
you made a mistake?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.931
You guys came to the party together?

21:11.520 --> 21:15.763
No. She went to get us some booze first
with her sister's lD.

21:15.816 --> 21:19.149
Which we realize is totally illegal,

21:19.195 --> 21:21.106
and we swear,
we've never done it before.

21:21.155 --> 21:25.615
Did she do that a lot--
Drink? Party?

21:25.659 --> 21:27.741
She used to think
getting crunked was lame.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.075
But lately...

21:29.121 --> 21:32.830
she's been drinking and... stuff.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.081
All right.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.375
I know you guys are scared.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.288
You know that other officer,
the one who took your phones?

21:42.218 --> 21:43.549
He's my BFF.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.592
Now if something happened to him,

21:45.638 --> 21:46.753
no matter how scared I was,

21:46.806 --> 21:48.637
I'd want his parents to know the truth.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.678
There's this guy, Adam.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.310
Julia's been dating him
for a couple months.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.527
He's a total wheel show.
He dates everyone.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.482
- Anyway, they broke up.
- He's a complete douche nozzle.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.700
Was he here tonight?

22:12.748 --> 22:14.113
He took her upstairs.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.658
He said he needed to talk to her.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.331
The next thing we knew,
they were screaming at each other...

22:20.381 --> 22:21.746
like they were gonna
kill each other.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.796
(Sam) You've done this before,
so you know the drill.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.841
Yeah, you take the lead.
I'm gonna ride shotgun.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.805
Yeah. This is just a warm-up.
If he coughs up anything relevant,

22:35.855 --> 22:37.186
we gotta call in the D's.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.303
(door beeps open)

22:38.649 --> 22:40.185
(Sam) Doesn't look good, Adam.

22:40.234 --> 22:41.440
Please, I didn't do anything.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.066
What were you doing up there?
(door closes)

22:43.863 --> 22:44.852
Talking.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.400
(laughs) On the roof?

22:48.242 --> 22:50.699
Upstairs in the--
in the bedroom.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.656
She was super drunk,
and, you know, she--

22:53.706 --> 22:55.116
I told her she shouldn't be drinking,

22:55.165 --> 22:57.201
and--and she said she felt sick,

22:57.251 --> 22:59.207
and so she needed some fresh air.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.369
So she's super drunk,
but you let her go out on the roof?

23:01.422 --> 23:03.708
Well, she was being all dramatic,
and she was yelling at me

23:03.757 --> 23:06.669
and saying that, you know,
she didn't care if she fell

23:06.719 --> 23:08.835
and, you know, she didn't
care if it was over.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.176
Look, I know |--| shouldn't
have let her go out there,

23:12.224 --> 23:14.340
but I swear she fell.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.382
And you just ran?

23:15.436 --> 23:18.052
I didn't know what else to do.
l was freaked out.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.096
You could have called 911,
tried to get help,

23:20.149 --> 23:21.184
tried to save her life.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.350
I saw what she looked like down there,

23:24.403 --> 23:26.234
and there was nothing to save.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.360
Nothing to save?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.522
You know that's a human being
that you're talking about.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.315
That's not what--what I meant.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.904
No, it's not like she's a nobody.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.282
You can'tjust push a girl off a roof,
walk away and forget about it.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.039
I didn't push her!
It's not my fault!

23:39.084 --> 23:40.244
Calm down. Calm down.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.457
She shouldn't have been
drinking in the first place.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.292
Why not? Why shouldn't she
have been drinking? Huh? Hmm?

23:46.342 --> 23:49.800
She's a girl and...
You know what I mean.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.176
No, I don't know what you mean.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.216
Whatever it is you're not telling us, Adam,

23:53.265 --> 23:55.221
it's time you came clean, okay?

23:55.267 --> 23:56.598
Adam?

23:59.313 --> 24:00.769
Got it.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.065
(beep)

24:07.905 --> 24:09.566
(lowers voice)
Things just got worse.

24:09.615 --> 24:10.775
(whispers) What?

24:15.287 --> 24:18.450
Boyfriend told Swarek
that Julia was pregnant.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.035
Ohh.

24:20.084 --> 24:23.167
He was on the roof with her.
Says she fell.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.668
Yeah, or she was pushed.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.455
Yeah, or maybe she doesn't want
to be pregnant, so she jumps.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.384
No, I don't think shejumped.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.255
Even Ashley said her sister
would never hurt herself.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.919
Okay, so that's what Ashley says.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.429
But maybe her mom knows different.

24:35.474 --> 24:39.092
No, I think she's right.
Look, a parent like that--

24:39.144 --> 24:42.136
stressed out
and head somewhere else--

24:42.982 --> 24:46.190
Julia would have never wanted
to hurt her. I know.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.233
All right. Well, now I gotta hurt her.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.939
How can we possibly tell
those poor people more bad news?

24:53.367 --> 24:55.653
'Cause that's ourjob.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.539
(sighs)

25:04.294 --> 25:06.876
(somber music plays)

25:15.472 --> 25:18.339
(no audible dialogue)

25:38.203 --> 25:39.363
Are you all right?

25:39.413 --> 25:41.870
(voice breaking)
Yeah. I just want to be alone.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.681
(indistinct conversations)

26:04.730 --> 26:07.187
These kids are gonna be
grounded for life.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.723
Yeah, that's getting off easy.
There's a dead girl outside.

26:09.777 --> 26:10.766
(cell phone beeping)

26:10.819 --> 26:12.400
Man, and none of these kids
saw her fall?

26:12.446 --> 26:14.437
Dude, are you still working
on the cell phones?

26:14.490 --> 26:17.197
Yeah. Manual says you should do
a full inventory of personal property.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.450
Relax with the manual. Didn't you learn
anything from your evaluation?

26:20.496 --> 26:21.611
Come on.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.324
Don't tell me to relax.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.080
I mean, it's not my fault

26:26.126 --> 26:28.788
I don't think following procedure
is a joke, okay?

26:28.837 --> 26:30.543
I mean, at least I do that
instead of goofing off.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.080
Right, 'cause being a mindless grunt
is so much better.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.998
Better than being a child.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.043
I mean, "Hey, dude,
how's the washing machine work?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.302
When's garbage day?"

26:38.347 --> 26:41.214
Garbage day? You have a machine
that crushes up your pop cans.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.474
- So?
- So real men use their hands.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.181
Yeah, well, I guess real men
also date strippers.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.396
Real coppers put their skills to use.

26:50.484 --> 26:53.066
Now, I found out about that boyfriend.
What have you done?

26:56.281 --> 26:57.441
(woman on cell phone video)
Oh, my God!

26:58.617 --> 27:00.858
(screaming)

27:00.911 --> 27:03.823
- (man) She fell! She fell!-
- (woman) Oh, my God!

27:03.872 --> 27:04.861
Look.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.075
- (people screaming)
- (man) ...something horrible!

27:06.125 --> 27:08.662
Hey, Dad. I saw that you called.

27:08.710 --> 27:09.836
Just give me a callback.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.539
(beep, shuts cell phone)

27:12.047 --> 27:13.708
(distant clatter from downstairs)

27:15.384 --> 27:16.373
Dana?

27:20.889 --> 27:21.924
Sergeant?

27:24.476 --> 27:25.977
Is everything okay?

27:38.073 --> 27:39.233
Oh, my God.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.161
What kind of mother have I become?

27:51.253 --> 27:52.584
Dana, don't move.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.254
Okay, let's just talk about this.

27:57.551 --> 27:58.666
You know, one minute...

27:59.469 --> 28:01.175
you're digging out lEDs...

28:02.181 --> 28:04.092
and picking up body parts,

28:05.309 --> 28:08.517
and the next, your little girl's
standing at the bedroom door

28:08.562 --> 28:09.893
wanting to say good night.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.306
How do you go
from one to the other?

28:15.027 --> 28:16.062
I don't know.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.692
And there's a part of you

28:18.739 --> 28:20.024
that knows...

28:21.200 --> 28:22.736
you should open up to her

28:23.535 --> 28:25.036
because she needs you.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.079
But you can't do it...

28:30.209 --> 28:32.291
because if you crack that armor

28:32.794 --> 28:34.330
long enough to let her in,

28:35.297 --> 28:38.255
then you have to go back over there
with it cracked.

28:39.009 --> 28:39.998
I understand.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.213
(voice breaking)
You don't understand.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.838
How can you possibly understand?

28:47.226 --> 28:48.215
You wait.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.933
You wait another ten years.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.012
You just wait until this job
has ruined every relationship

28:54.066 --> 28:55.397
you've ever tried to have.

28:57.861 --> 29:00.102
You wait until some stranger
knocks on your door

29:00.155 --> 29:02.111
to tell you that your baby's dead.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.443
And the worst thing is...

29:06.119 --> 29:07.905
you aren't even surprised

29:09.456 --> 29:11.788
because everyone you've ever loved,

29:12.167 --> 29:14.374
everyone who's gotten close to you,

29:15.254 --> 29:17.461
eventually turns to dust.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.424
This is not your fault.

29:23.679 --> 29:24.759
(Andy) Oh, my God.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.464
It is my fault...

29:28.517 --> 29:29.632
Don't. Don't.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.300
...because she needed me,

29:34.815 --> 29:36.396
and I wasn't there for her.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.556
Put the gun down.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.568
Mom, please!
No, don't. Get back. Stop.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.989
Put it down. Now.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.110
If you pull that trigger,

29:46.159 --> 29:48.821
all you'll be is a selfish woman

29:48.870 --> 29:51.862
who forced her 21-year-old daughter

29:51.915 --> 29:55.123
to bury her whole family in one day.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.746
Are you gonna do that to her?

29:58.630 --> 29:59.710
Huh?

30:00.173 --> 30:03.006
Are you gonna make her scrub
your blood off these walls?

30:03.760 --> 30:05.170
Are you gonna do that to us--

30:05.220 --> 30:07.757
force us to take down one of our own?

30:08.932 --> 30:11.048
What kind of soldier are you?
(begins to sob)

30:11.351 --> 30:13.592
What kind of mother are you?

30:16.273 --> 30:17.604
Drop the gun, Dana.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.436
Yeah. Yeah.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.605
Yeah. (groans)

30:22.654 --> 30:25.111
You get the body.
I'll get the gun. Okay?

30:25.157 --> 30:26.772
(sobbing) I tried to be a good mother.
(handcuffs clicking)

30:26.825 --> 30:28.816
(Noelle) I know. I know you did.
I know you did.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.734
What--what are you doing?
It's for her own safety.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.119
- Ashley.
- Mommy.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.826
Oh, baby.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.708
- (Ashley crying)
- (Dana) I'm sorry.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.331
(sobbing) I'm sorry.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.922
(people on cell phone video,
shouting indistinctly)

30:43.967 --> 30:45.207
(Julia laughs)

30:45.302 --> 30:46.337
(man) Come,
I’ll make you a drink!

30:46.636 --> 30:48.797
(Julia laughs, speaks indistinctly)

30:48.847 --> 30:49.882
You see?

30:49.931 --> 30:51.307
The boyfriend
wasn't anywhere near her

30:51.350 --> 30:52.339
when she slipped and fell.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.304
Whoo! (laughs, speaks indistinctly)

30:56.188 --> 30:58.554
- (man) Hey! Hey! She fell!
- (screaming)

30:58.607 --> 31:00.438
- (man) She fell!
- (woman) Oh, my God!

31:00.484 --> 31:02.691
All right, so that's the kid who taped it.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.480
He was outside when the fight started.

31:04.529 --> 31:05.939
I guess he thought
it was funny or something.

31:08.950 --> 31:13.444
And donkey here doesn't think
to bring it to us right away?

31:13.497 --> 31:15.533
(Dov) Actually, sir, he doesn't
remember taking the video.

31:15.582 --> 31:16.571
Well, how did you find it?

31:16.625 --> 31:18.456
It was Chris' idea to search the phones.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.659
Oh? Good work, Diaz.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.293
Thank you, sir.

31:22.672 --> 31:23.878
Don't know how to turn this off.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.290
- (Chris) Oh, uh...
- And, you, with the two girls.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.762
Whatever those are,
wipe 'em off your faces.

31:32.849 --> 31:34.805
You gotta get back
for your evaluations.

31:36.770 --> 31:38.635
Hup two, hup, hup.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.848
(crunches)

31:39.898 --> 31:42.105
It's not like I was expecting
a hug or anything, but...

31:42.150 --> 31:44.983
I know, but not even
a hair tousle or a high five?

31:45.028 --> 31:46.234
Yeah.

31:46.279 --> 31:49.407
Hey, for the record,
I do know when garbage day is.

31:49.449 --> 31:52.657
Yeah, man, I...
l was being a jerk.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.235
Me, too.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.620
And the pop can crusher you have...

31:58.417 --> 31:59.406
It's totally awesome.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.871
(laughs) Thanks, man.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.749
(Noelle) You ready?

32:14.141 --> 32:15.176
McNally?

32:16.726 --> 32:18.853
If you hadn't have come in,
she would have killed herself.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.271
You don't know that.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.024
Come on.
Boss is waiting for you.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.107
(Andy)
It's like it's all adding up.

32:29.823 --> 32:30.903
It's creeping up on me,

32:30.949 --> 32:33.281
and itjust took today
for me to finally see it.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.025
See what?

32:37.456 --> 32:39.367
The cost of doing this job.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.832
(exhales deeply)
Sit down.

32:48.925 --> 32:49.914
So what are you saying?

32:49.968 --> 32:52.254
I'm saying I'm scared

32:52.304 --> 32:55.296
of what happens when you wear
your uniform too long,

32:56.308 --> 32:57.297
like that woman tonight.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.760
That woman lost a child.

32:58.810 --> 33:02.052
That woman screwed up her life
because she couldn't take her uniform off.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.482
- You think that's gonna happen to you?
- It already is happening to me.

33:05.609 --> 33:08.146
Every night, I lie in bed
weighing my decisions.

33:09.738 --> 33:14.072
That family tonight--the pain
that I brought into their home--

33:14.117 --> 33:16.779
how am I supposed to just take
my uniform off and forget about that?

33:16.828 --> 33:17.988
You don't.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.112
You've had a heavy year, Andy.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.703
It's okay to be affected by it.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.161
No one expects you to be able
to just brush it off.

33:28.548 --> 33:31.255
Every bad call is--
is like a ghost...

33:33.512 --> 33:34.922
(sighs)

33:34.971 --> 33:38.304
And I know firsthand what shoving
all those ghosts into a closet

33:38.350 --> 33:39.339
can do to a cop.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.094
You mean your old man?

33:42.437 --> 33:43.426
(whispers) I'm sorry.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.599
(voice breaking)
What if that happens to me?

33:52.030 --> 33:53.110
Listen...

33:53.657 --> 33:55.193
the uniform does not make the cop.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.319
Andy, listen to me.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.485
The uniform does not make the cop.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.994
You--

34:01.039 --> 34:02.870
The cop makes the uniform.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.705
There are as many ways to do this job
as there are cops who do it.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.088
Give me the badge.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.641
(thud)

34:28.191 --> 34:29.931
You've been carrying around
your father's badge.

34:29.985 --> 34:32.146
It's a nice gesture,
keeping it in family.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.731
But you need a new one--

34:33.780 --> 34:37.068
your own badge, a fresh start.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.440
But it's up to you.

.l‘ And, if for the moment, I .l‘

35:18.867 --> 35:23.236
.l‘ Should have left those words
for a quiet prayer .l‘

35:25.582 --> 35:29.200
.l‘ It'd be 7 years gone .l‘

35:29.252 --> 35:32.244
.l‘ I'd still be asking why .l‘

35:32.297 --> 35:34.879
.l‘ I'd still be waiting .l‘

35:34.924 --> 35:36.755
.l‘ La, da, da, da-da-da .l‘

35:37.010 --> 35:42.380
.l‘ 7 years for one moment just to try .l‘

35:42.432 --> 35:44.764
.l‘ I'd still be waiting .l‘

35:45.518 --> 35:47.509
.l‘ Oh-ohh .l‘

35:56.655 --> 35:59.567
.l‘ That night's a familiar taste .l‘

36:00.450 --> 36:02.441
J‘ In my mouth where .l‘

36:02.494 --> 36:04.735
.l‘ Words often keep their place .l‘

36:07.040 --> 36:10.157
.l‘ And, if for the moment, I .l‘

36:10.460 --> 36:15.045
.l‘ Would've left those words
for a better day .l‘

36:17.425 --> 36:21.213
.l‘ It'd be 7 years gone .l‘

36:21.262 --> 36:23.799
.l‘ I'd still be asking why .l‘

36:26.643 --> 36:28.474

36:28.520 --> 36:32.809
.l‘ 7 years for one moment .l‘

36:32.857 --> 36:36.645
.l‘ Just to try, I'd still be waiting .l‘

36:37.362 --> 36:39.318
.l‘ Oh-ohh .l‘

36:40.115 --> 36:43.027
.l‘ We faded once one time .l‘

36:45.286 --> 36:48.778

36:49.582 --> 36:53.495
.l‘ That I only gave it one good-bye .l‘

36:54.087 --> 36:55.668
Ah. (laughs)

36:55.714 --> 36:57.170
Hey. How'd you guys do?

36:57.215 --> 36:59.331
Flying colors, all of us.
Wasn't worried.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.590
Now it's official.
We're all part of the family.

37:01.636 --> 37:02.625
What about you?

37:02.679 --> 37:04.465
Yeah, me, too.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.846
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah! All right!

37:06.891 --> 37:09.849
Um, am | the only one that's terrified?

37:10.437 --> 37:11.597
(Traci) Oh!

37:11.688 --> 37:12.973
(Frank) You've all been judged...

37:14.399 --> 37:16.230
and you've been found...

37:17.652 --> 37:18.641
capable...

37:19.738 --> 37:20.818
(One Republic's "Good Life"
playing)

37:20.864 --> 37:22.570
resourceful...

37:25.493 --> 37:26.482
loyal...

37:29.080 --> 37:30.536

37:33.918 --> 37:34.998

37:36.254 --> 37:37.915
So it's with great pleasure

37:38.381 --> 37:39.882

37:41.801 --> 37:45.214
And in the great tradition of 15 Division,

37:45.263 --> 37:47.094
I say to your training officers...

37:47.849 --> 37:49.464
coppers, cut those ties.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.008
(cheering)

37:52.061 --> 37:57.351
.l‘ Oh, this has gotta be the good life,
This could really be a good life J‘

37:57.400 --> 37:59.777
.l‘ Good life, I say oh .l‘

37:59.819 --> 38:03.152
.l‘ Got this feeling that you can't fight .l‘

38:03.198 --> 38:05.610
.l‘ Like this city is on fire tonight .l‘

38:05.658 --> 38:07.194
J‘ This could really be a good life .l‘

38:07.243 --> 38:08.278
You sure you want to be here?

38:08.328 --> 38:10.535
Yes, sir. lam.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.242
(cheering)

38:17.378 --> 38:18.367
Thank you.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.914
Ladies and gentlemen--
the new and improved

38:21.966 --> 38:23.297
rookies of 15 Division!

38:24.052 --> 38:25.212
(cheering)

38:29.474 --> 38:30.509
(sighs) All right, Trace.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.131
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.390
All right, I can't watch anymore.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.054
I'm gonna get another round.
Anybody want?

38:38.107 --> 38:39.142
No, thank you.

38:40.443 --> 38:41.478
Whoa.

38:42.111 --> 38:43.146
(Andy) Wow.

38:43.196 --> 38:44.606
Hate to dominate and dash.

38:44.656 --> 38:45.896
What--Leo?

38:45.949 --> 38:47.814
Um, sort of.

38:48.618 --> 38:51.781
Oh, nice to see that, uh,
you got your appetite back.

38:51.830 --> 38:55.038
Yes, sir. Cut loose, ready to get...
(singsong voice) crunked.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.658
(normal voice) Ah, that's what the kids
are saying these days.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.672
Right. Well, it's a good thing
you speak idiot.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.329
Kind of came in handy today.

39:03.842 --> 39:07.926
You know, sir, for the record,
I do take myjob very seriously.

39:07.971 --> 39:10.212
You know, I actually know that.

39:11.641 --> 39:14.724
You know? And the big, uh,
the big secret to policing

39:14.769 --> 39:16.134
is just you are what you are.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.178
You just gotta make the most of it.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.563
Yeah, think about that
while you're getting crunked.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.015
And by the way, Epstein,

39:23.069 --> 39:24.809
the boss doesn'tjust
leave paperwork around

39:24.863 --> 39:26.649
unless he wants you to read it.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.777
(clink)

39:34.330 --> 39:37.197
(lowers voice) Did you want me
to give you your shot before I go?

39:38.710 --> 39:42.544
Mm, this is the only shot
that I need for now.

39:43.548 --> 39:48.133
Um, to finally being free of our rookies.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.428
(clinking)
Hooah!

39:49.470 --> 39:50.459
Hooah!

39:53.391 --> 39:54.426
Ah.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.176
Look, I know that I could do it by myself,

39:58.229 --> 39:59.810
but I'm...

39:59.856 --> 40:01.266
I'm just not sure I should.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.056
Are you sure?

40:04.235 --> 40:05.315
Look, you have Dex.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.943
All right, he may not be perfect,
but he's there.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.314
Good night.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.107
- (Sam) Good night.
- (Oliver) Congrats.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.364
- Three more?
- (Jerry) Officer Nash?

40:16.414 --> 40:18.154
An apple martini--
your favorite.

40:18.207 --> 40:19.663
l was just heading out.

40:19.709 --> 40:21.199
Mm. You want some company?

40:22.879 --> 40:24.210
Actually, I'm going to see Leo.

40:25.632 --> 40:27.918
Oh, I thought he--
Dex had him all weekend.

40:27.967 --> 40:31.926
He does, but we're having
breakfast together.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.008
I want to be there when he wakes up.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.345
Right.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.770
I'm sorry, Jerry.

40:39.812 --> 40:40.972
Yeah.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.434
Um, you give, uh,

40:43.483 --> 40:45.940

a little kiss for me.

40:46.903 --> 40:47.938
Yeah.

40:51.491 --> 40:52.697
(door squeaks)

40:53.242 --> 40:56.029
- Okay, so any preferences?
- No, lady's choice.

40:56.079 --> 40:58.536
Ooh. Tequila!

40:58.581 --> 41:00.572
That's what I'm talkin' about!
(Gail laughs)

41:00.625 --> 41:02.707
- Augh...eww.
- (Andy laughs)

41:02.752 --> 41:04.959
- Hey! Congratulations.
- Hi!

41:05.463 --> 41:07.419
Mwah. What did I say?
No sweat, huh?

41:07.465 --> 41:10.047
Oh, very cute even when
you're being patronizing.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.082
Let's get a drink.

41:12.679 --> 41:13.668
(Gail) Thank you.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.757
So have you, uh,
heard from your father yet?

41:15.807 --> 41:17.968
Yeah, he called me
when l was in with sarge.

41:18.267 --> 41:21.100
He just left a message saying
he decided to go to a different meeting.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.681
- And so you were right.
- Hmm.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.891
Well, at least now
you can relax and celebrate.

41:25.942 --> 41:28.433
Yeah, except I have no idea
how I'm gonna tell him

41:28.486 --> 41:29.851
I'm not gonna use his badge anymore.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.644
Oh, come on. He'll understand.

41:31.698 --> 41:33.234
He'll be too proud of you to be upset.

41:33.616 --> 41:34.696
I hope so.

41:42.792 --> 41:43.781
Are you okay?

41:45.253 --> 41:47.335
Yep. Great. You?

41:48.881 --> 41:50.337
Can we get some air?

41:50.383 --> 41:52.624
Sure. Sure.
