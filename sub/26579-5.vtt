22:10.710 --> 22:12.710

Mr. Askari is clearly connected

It's a relic of a time

22:51.290 --> 22:53.120
drove a wedge between the cops
and the community.

22:53.120 --> 22:56.000
I get it. You think it promotes
an "us versus them" mentality.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.830
And you're right. But the "them"
isn't the community.

22:57.830 --> 22:59.790
It's the criminals.

22:59.790 --> 23:01.880
