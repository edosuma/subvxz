WEBVTT

00:26.986 --> 00:33.826
In every war... In every age...

00:34.076 --> 00:38.998
The forgotten weapon is...

00:40.082 --> 00:44.879
...Food. For to kill, soldiers must live...

00:46.547 --> 00:51.344
...to live, they must eat.

00:52.386 --> 00:57.683
And a herd of cattle is...

00:57.975 --> 01:01.687
...as vital as a herd of cannon.

01:08.277 --> 01:13.949
The United States in 1864.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.836
Hey, we made it, amigos!

03:48.479 --> 03:52.066
When you're ready to talk business,
Kelly, I'll be at my hotel.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.485
- You're Steadman.
- Major Steadman.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.613
Major Steadman.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.073
Sorry.

03:59.323 --> 04:03.869
Major, I've got the most
marvellous beef in the world for you.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.581
The best beef in all of Mexico.
No, Sanchez?

04:08.666 --> 04:11.794
They're a little thin by now,
but it's been a long walk.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.089
- A few days in the pasture...
- You are late, Mr. Kelly.

04:15.297 --> 04:20.302
Ten days late. Ten miserable days
in this stinking, hot town.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.472
Is it Vermont or Massachusetts?

04:24.557 --> 04:25.975
I'm from Boston...

04:26.225 --> 04:31.355
...which, may I tell you, is one
long way from this prairie rat hole.

04:32.690 --> 04:36.777
Well, there are certain compensations,
major, in a railroad town.

04:37.028 --> 04:40.156
I was hoping that you brought
a couple of them along.

04:40.406 --> 04:41.615
I see.

04:41.866 --> 04:44.952
I don't happen to be a procurer, Mr. Kelly.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.370
Forgive me.

04:47.246 --> 04:48.497
Whiskey or sherry?

04:48.748 --> 04:52.626
I'm here on business, Mr. Kelly.
United States Army business.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.129
I'm waiting for an explanation.

04:57.006 --> 04:59.091
What were you in civilian life?

04:59.300 --> 05:01.510
A lawyer. I want an explanation.

05:01.761 --> 05:03.304
Lawyer, huh?

05:03.554 --> 05:06.223
- You've never driven cattle?
- Hardly.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.850
Hardly.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.645
Three months, major. Not ten days.

05:11.896 --> 05:15.441
Three months, staring into
the rear ends of those beeves.

05:15.691 --> 05:18.069
Smelling their stink,
choking on their dust...

05:18.319 --> 05:21.405
...listening to their
damn bellowing night and day.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.576
I'm a reasonable man.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.287
If I weren't...

05:28.496 --> 05:32.458
...I might go over to the other side
and see how their manners are.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.586
You'd do business with the Confederates?

05:39.423 --> 05:40.591
No.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.510
Their money's no good.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.184
Kelly.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.228
What's he doing?

05:57.149 --> 06:00.403
If I'm not mistaken,
someone's stealing my wine.

06:06.492 --> 06:09.370
I thought you were a soldier,
not a sheriff.

06:16.961 --> 06:19.171
You like my wine, Paco?

06:21.132 --> 06:22.633
I like it if you do, huh?

06:22.883 --> 06:25.011
Costs five dollars a bottle.

06:25.261 --> 06:27.722
That's ten dollars out of your pay.

06:28.180 --> 06:32.727
Since you're a generous man,
share the rest with your friends here.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.817
I don't understand you.
I don't understand you at all.

06:40.026 --> 06:42.319
A thief should be punished.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.113
We'll have dinner now.

06:44.363 --> 06:47.742
And take a few more bottles of wine
out to our friends.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.205
He's a lonely thief, Steadman...

06:53.456 --> 06:56.334
...trying to celebrate
after a rough journey.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.002
He'll be happy to go home.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.837
They all will.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.589
And so will I.

07:01.797 --> 07:05.259
I'm afraid you won't be going home
quite yet, Mr. Kelly.

07:05.509 --> 07:09.013
There's been a change.
Take the cattle by rail to Virginia.

07:09.221 --> 07:13.392
Deliver them to a plantation
near Richmond. The pasture is there.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.186
You'll be paid on arrival.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.063
That's not in the agreement.

07:17.313 --> 07:19.857
I was ordered to bring the cattle here.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.151
The war's going into a new phase.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.113
We're concentrating on Richmond.
And when we take it, we've won.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.407
I don't care who wins.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.578
You want that herd in Virginia?

07:32.870 --> 07:36.123
It'll cost you five dollars per head extra.

07:36.540 --> 07:40.419
I'm authorized to pay you one dollar
a head extra. Not a penny more.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.380
That's not Army beef yet, major.

07:42.588 --> 07:45.299
Not until I get paid off on my contract.

07:45.508 --> 07:50.638
The contract specifies, in rather
small print, I'll admit:

07:51.097 --> 07:54.684
" Payment shall be made when the beef
is delivered to the area...

07:54.892 --> 07:58.229
...deemed most urgent
by the commanding general."

07:58.813 --> 08:01.023
Which is 30 miles south of Richmond.

08:01.232 --> 08:06.153
It's in order. I prepared it myself.
Even specifying the size of the print.

08:06.529 --> 08:09.198
Now those steers are going east, Mr. Kelly.

08:16.122 --> 08:19.750
Oh, by Godfrey, that judge.
He thought he had me licked.

08:20.001 --> 08:21.794
Licked, Kelly.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.548
But he underestimated the man
he was dealing with.

08:27.883 --> 08:29.719
I hit that judge...

08:30.219 --> 08:33.681
I hit him with a writ of certiorari.

08:33.889 --> 08:37.643
It's like a brilliant bolt
out of the black, a tiger springing.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.102
A writ of certiorari!

08:39.311 --> 08:41.188
Play cards, Steadman.

09:10.051 --> 09:11.093
Thousands of them.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.228
The boys in blue
are gonna eat beef tonight.

09:21.437 --> 09:25.191
And tomorrow and next month.
Till it's coming out of their craws.

09:25.399 --> 09:28.527
Maybe it's our stomachs
making us see what ain't there.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.239
Colonel, how about me going
and bringing back proof.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.784
Just to make it official.

09:34.992 --> 09:38.120
My orders are to scout that herd.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.164
Go ahead.

09:40.873 --> 09:43.959
Just make sure the Yanks don't scout me.

10:20.913 --> 10:21.956
Oh, Lord.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.917
This is always embarrassing.

10:25.710 --> 10:28.796
I'm sure you'll handle it
with your customary tact.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.549
- Take over, captain.
- Yes, sir.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.771
Major Steadman, ma'am.

10:46.439 --> 10:47.481
I'm Charity Warwick.

10:48.232 --> 10:51.318
This is Alvarez Kelly,
who brought the cattle here.

10:52.445 --> 10:55.322
I was ordered to arrange quarters
for the two of you.

10:55.573 --> 10:58.409
Your men can camp in the field
below the house.

10:58.909 --> 11:02.163
Mr. Kelly, the grazing is best
in the north pasture.

11:02.413 --> 11:04.915
You may eat
in my dining room tonight, major.

11:05.124 --> 11:08.336
But from tomorrow on,
you'll make other arrangements.

11:08.586 --> 11:09.920
Mrs. Warwick...

11:10.129 --> 11:12.048
...will you join us for dinner?

11:17.261 --> 11:18.679
Nice try, but I don't think...

11:18.929 --> 11:20.514
She's a lady, Kelly.

11:20.765 --> 11:22.016
A great lady.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.685
One rarely has the privilege
to meet such a...

11:26.145 --> 11:27.521
What does that mean?

11:27.772 --> 11:29.065
Woman.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.946
- Pick up those strays.
- I'll get them.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.748
Go get that meat!

12:08.104 --> 12:08.938
Sir?

12:09.146 --> 12:12.775
Cleet Warwick must be
rolling around in his grave.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.488
I'll bet this is the first time
his place...

12:17.738 --> 12:21.117
...has been lit up like that
since Manassas.

12:22.410 --> 12:25.204
- Eat while it's hot.
- The man who brought the cattle.

12:25.454 --> 12:29.125
- Colonel, I promise you...
- That man really knew his business.

12:29.375 --> 12:33.295
Moved that herd like it was
a column of infantry.

12:36.424 --> 12:38.676
That's prime beef, Johnny.

12:46.308 --> 12:50.604
And there's enough down there
to feed a lot of people...

12:52.356 --> 12:56.861
...who haven't chewed on meat
in a long, long time.

12:57.570 --> 13:00.239
Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.

13:00.489 --> 13:03.367
Now with the $10,000 advance
paid to you in Mexico...

13:03.617 --> 13:07.913
...it makes it a total of $50,000
and completes our original contract.

13:08.289 --> 13:09.790
Plus the...

13:10.499 --> 13:12.918
...additional $2500.

13:13.127 --> 13:15.004
Just sign here.

13:16.339 --> 13:19.383
- Buying beef at three dollars a head.
- Two.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.845
- And selling them for 20.
- Not bad.

13:23.429 --> 13:25.222
It's outrageous.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.351
You go to some nice place
to count your profits?

13:29.060 --> 13:32.521
I spend it, Steadman.
I spend it and enjoy it.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.858
And when it's all gone, raise it again.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.569
You make it sound simple.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.280
It is, if you don't want it too bad.

13:42.573 --> 13:46.285
Money, whiskey and women.
Your three deities.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.788
Tell me something, Mr. Kelly:

13:49.246 --> 13:51.499
Have they made you a happy man?

13:53.167 --> 13:54.418
No.

13:54.919 --> 13:57.338
But not as miserable a one as you.

14:04.095 --> 14:05.304
Mrs. Warwick.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.557
Dinner is served, gentlemen.

14:09.517 --> 14:12.269
How nice. You changed your mind.

14:12.520 --> 14:13.813
A lady's privilege.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.315
Your privilege is our pleasure, ma'am.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.192
I got hungry.

14:20.027 --> 14:24.073
Driving thousands of half-wild
animals across thousands of miles.

14:24.323 --> 14:27.785
For someone brought up in these parts,
it seems impossible.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.705
I have such respect for special knowledge.

14:30.955 --> 14:32.415
It's nothing.

14:32.623 --> 14:34.917
You certainly know how to charge for it.

14:35.459 --> 14:38.045
Do you object to making money,
Miss Charity?

14:38.295 --> 14:40.965
In wartime? I think so.

14:41.215 --> 14:45.094
Making money out of war.
It's almost an act of nature.

14:46.095 --> 14:48.806
Do you have any idea
what a major's salary is?

14:49.974 --> 14:51.976
I wasn't talking about that.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.605
What about a colone"s salary?
And the prestige afterward?

14:56.856 --> 15:00.234
You'll carry that rank
into every courtroom for life.

15:00.443 --> 15:03.863
- I didn't go to war for that.
- No, but you'll use it.

15:04.488 --> 15:07.658
Every man, in his own special way,
takes care of number one.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.745
I don't admire men like that, Mr. Kelly.

15:11.412 --> 15:13.039
Mrs. Warwick...

15:13.664 --> 15:17.752
...if there were a kind of profit
driven right into your own back yard...

15:18.002 --> 15:21.172
...would there be any reason not
to take advantage of it?

15:21.881 --> 15:23.466
What do you mean by that?

15:23.716 --> 15:26.385
I would say it's a matter
of the north pasture.

15:26.886 --> 15:29.680
The north... You're talking in riddles.

15:31.349 --> 15:32.850
To you, ma'am?

15:34.185 --> 15:35.770
I don't understand.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.732
I was curious.

15:39.982 --> 15:44.362
When Mrs. Warwick specified the
north pasture, I wanted to know why.

15:44.612 --> 15:46.405
The soil, major, is overworked.

15:46.655 --> 15:49.700
Dying for the lack of fertilizer.

15:50.534 --> 15:54.121
- Well, yes, but I still don't...
- Manure, major.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.832
I didn't know you were a farmer.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.834
I was raised on a farm.

15:59.085 --> 16:01.045
My father's estancia in Texas.

16:01.295 --> 16:04.048
Estancia. What a lovely word.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.842
So is caridad.

16:07.468 --> 16:08.928
Charity.

16:10.680 --> 16:11.889
Yes, it was lovely.

16:12.139 --> 16:15.601
It was lovely and big.

16:16.060 --> 16:17.269
Open.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.772
Fifty families lived on it.

16:20.231 --> 16:23.651
My father was like a lord.
Like an Irish lord.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.861
Yet this virtuous Irish lord...

16:26.112 --> 16:30.616
...was not quite able to stop his son
from turning pirate, was he?

16:32.368 --> 16:36.247
Make jokes, Steadman, about the war,
about God, and about me.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.999
But don't make jokes about my father.

16:43.629 --> 16:45.756
He was killed defending our home.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.384
Mexican War, I think you called it.

16:48.634 --> 16:52.263
We had other names for the theft
of a piece of our country.

16:52.805 --> 16:55.224
The officers wore the same uniform
you have on.

16:55.433 --> 16:58.978
Only some of them now
have changed it to grey.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.314
So I say, "Alvarez Kelly..."

17:02.565 --> 17:06.861
...take what you can from both sides.
Small return for your birthright."

17:07.903 --> 17:10.321
- Beg pardon, ma'am.
- What is it?

17:10.531 --> 17:12.366
A guard found one of our drovers...

17:12.616 --> 17:16.119
- ...beaten and unconscious.
- We're 30 miles behind the lines!

17:16.328 --> 17:18.455
They butchered a steer inside the gates.

17:18.664 --> 17:22.335
Where the hell were the sentries?
Excuse me.

17:23.461 --> 17:24.837
All right, let's go.

17:29.592 --> 17:30.885
The poor major.

17:31.093 --> 17:34.013
He finds duty more fascinating than...

17:34.597 --> 17:35.890
...pleasure.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.355
Do you undress every woman you meet?

17:44.315 --> 17:46.108
There has to be some beauty.

17:47.985 --> 17:50.488
Then it's no special compliment.

17:52.156 --> 17:54.575
Being a beautiful woman
is compliment enough.

18:05.961 --> 18:09.256
From what you've said
about your father's estancia...

18:10.091 --> 18:13.636
...it must have been something
like it was here before the war.

18:14.095 --> 18:15.721
Very much like it.

18:17.598 --> 18:20.935
Might be interesting
to buy some land around here.

18:21.727 --> 18:24.939
Not to help rebuild, though. Not to live.

18:25.189 --> 18:29.652
- Just to buy cheap and sell dear.
- It's a nuisance the other way around.

18:30.194 --> 18:32.029
You disappoint me, Mr. Kelly.

18:32.279 --> 18:36.075
After what happened to you, I should
think you'd sympathize with us.

18:36.283 --> 18:40.746
I have no sympathies, only instincts.
And they shy away from losers.

18:42.915 --> 18:45.126
I'm overstaying my welcome.
You must be tired.

18:45.334 --> 18:48.045
You underestimate yourself, Mr. Kelly.

18:48.754 --> 18:50.131
Rarely.

18:50.923 --> 18:52.633
Thank you for the evening.

18:55.511 --> 18:57.680
How long since you've been with a woman?

18:59.265 --> 19:00.766
Three months.

19:01.642 --> 19:02.685
A lifetime.

19:04.103 --> 19:06.397
My husband's been dead three years.

19:42.016 --> 19:44.560
There was someone
under the bed all the time.

19:45.478 --> 19:46.479
Hatcher.

19:46.729 --> 19:47.730
The money.

19:51.275 --> 19:53.819
I got just as many men outside.

19:54.028 --> 19:56.030
I warn you, I'm a Mexican national.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.199
Doing business with the Yanks.

19:58.991 --> 20:01.243
- My privilege.
- Grazer!

20:14.215 --> 20:15.841
The money.

20:24.684 --> 20:26.811
Obliged, Mr. Kelly.

20:31.649 --> 20:33.984
Just how far would you have gone?

20:38.531 --> 20:41.492
You bastards couldn't have
waited a while longer.

20:42.702 --> 20:43.994
Hatcher.

20:45.121 --> 20:46.247
Good night, Charity.

20:47.206 --> 20:48.290
God bless.

20:48.541 --> 20:50.376
Take care, Tom. God bless.

20:52.586 --> 20:53.796
God bless, Charity.

20:54.672 --> 20:55.881
Bless.

20:57.091 --> 20:58.134
Oh, Mrs. Warwick.

21:01.262 --> 21:02.847
Good night and God bless.

21:18.404 --> 21:19.447
Yes?

21:19.655 --> 21:21.532
Major Steadman.

21:29.248 --> 21:31.959
- Yes, major?
- You had visitors.

21:33.085 --> 21:34.879
Old friends of mine.

21:35.087 --> 21:36.505
Old, dear friends.

21:38.632 --> 21:40.343
And why did they take Kelly?

21:40.593 --> 21:42.595
For the money, wouldn't you say?

21:42.803 --> 21:45.556
They didn't have to kidnap him
to get his money.

21:45.806 --> 21:48.893
Perhaps they didn't want to shoot him
in front of me.

21:49.143 --> 21:50.561
Shoot him? For what?

21:51.437 --> 21:56.359
The way they see it, he committed
an act of war against the Confederacy.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.652
Of course, they're prejudiced.

21:59.111 --> 22:00.529
Mrs. Warwick...

22:01.238 --> 22:03.157
...did you know about this?

22:03.407 --> 22:05.117
Of course! I saw it happen.

22:05.326 --> 22:08.621
No, I mean beforehand.
I mean aiding and abetting.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.415
Oh, that difficult lawyer talk, major.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.918
Mr. Kelly was certainly right.

22:22.468 --> 22:25.554
Alvarez Kelly hijacked by rebels.

22:26.055 --> 22:28.224
You appreciate that, major?

22:30.518 --> 22:32.228
Mrs. Warwick.

22:38.234 --> 22:39.527
- Beaurider.
- Yes, sir.

22:39.735 --> 22:42.071
Get back to camp fast as you can.

22:42.321 --> 22:45.491
Straight back. We've had
our enjoyment for the evening.

22:45.700 --> 22:46.617
Yes, sir.

22:46.826 --> 22:48.703
Turn them around, boys!

22:52.081 --> 22:56.836
Now that that's over, would you mind
telling me what this is all about?

22:58.295 --> 23:00.589
Not yet. Get in.

23:03.259 --> 23:06.137
- Tell him to keep his hands off me.
- Get in.

23:06.345 --> 23:07.513
I may choose not to.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.182
You may choose to die too.

23:11.017 --> 23:15.021
You'd give up those stripes for that
privilege, wouldn't you, sergeant?

23:15.271 --> 23:17.898
As long as you knew my hands were tied.

23:18.816 --> 23:22.737
Rossiter, we both know you didn't
bring me this far to shoot me.

23:23.821 --> 23:28.576
For some reason, you want me alive
and in one piece. Why?

23:28.826 --> 23:32.288
You know, Mr. Kelly,
you talk too much. Get in.

23:38.544 --> 23:40.963
I'd like to tell you a little something.

23:41.213 --> 23:44.300
This river winds all the way to Richmond.

23:44.550 --> 23:47.053
Now, if I was to put you to sleep...

23:47.261 --> 23:50.639
...you'd miss some of the prettiest
scenery in all of Virginia.

23:51.766 --> 23:56.312
Colonel, in my inside pocket,
where my money used to be...

23:56.562 --> 23:59.190
...there's a cigar.
You could get it for me.

24:00.733 --> 24:02.318
Or better yet...

24:02.610 --> 24:04.403
...I could get it for myself.

24:04.653 --> 24:07.865
Bust him, colonel, sir!
Make him shut his big mouth.

24:26.592 --> 24:28.803
Confederate man-of-war?

24:54.328 --> 24:56.372
Kelly, we've got to have that beef.

24:56.622 --> 24:58.958
The army and the whole South is starving.

24:59.166 --> 25:02.169
- That's your problem, not mine.
- Damn it!

25:02.378 --> 25:05.923
If hungry people don't mean
anything to you, this should!

25:06.132 --> 25:08.217
That already belongs to me.

25:08.426 --> 25:09.427
We'll double it.

25:09.844 --> 25:11.137
In gold, colonel?

25:11.345 --> 25:14.682
Are you suggesting
our currency is no good, sir?

25:15.725 --> 25:17.643
Can I tell you what for?

25:17.852 --> 25:21.230
Colonel, I have to hand it to you.
You're not just half-mad.

25:21.439 --> 25:24.817
How do you figure you're going to
get 2500 head of cattle...

25:25.067 --> 25:27.236
...over Grant's lines? By balloon?

25:27.486 --> 25:30.156
Nope. We don't have that many balloons.

25:30.406 --> 25:32.658
All right, we can't get over them.

25:32.908 --> 25:35.119
But we can go around.

25:35.327 --> 25:39.290
We can make this big circle.
Come up behind the plantation.

25:39.498 --> 25:42.877
Then we just shoo those cattle
back the way we came.

25:43.085 --> 25:45.963
- Just "shoo" them back?
- That's right.

25:49.050 --> 25:51.969
You know there's a small army
guarding those steers.

25:52.178 --> 25:54.096
Don't you expect a fight?

25:54.305 --> 25:56.807
I'll handle the military.
You handle the herd.

25:57.016 --> 25:58.934
- Fair division.
- Then you'll do it?

25:59.727 --> 26:04.398
Mr. Harrison, I intend to die in bed,
in the arms of a beautiful woman.

26:04.607 --> 26:07.360
We all share that wish, sir.

26:07.568 --> 26:10.071
I do not intend to die
from a Yankee bullet.

26:10.321 --> 26:12.448
So I say the hell with it, colonel.

26:14.325 --> 26:16.827
You're not walking out of here.

26:17.620 --> 26:22.041
This city is swarming with spies,
and you know our plan.

26:23.042 --> 26:24.669
Worth nothing.

26:24.919 --> 26:27.213
You couldn't even try it without me.

26:37.682 --> 26:41.227
Oh, look at the soldier boy!

26:44.647 --> 26:46.023
Morning.

26:47.983 --> 26:49.151
Morning.

26:49.402 --> 26:51.237
Enjoying yourself?

26:51.904 --> 26:53.322
Oh, yes.

26:53.572 --> 26:55.658
I like cockroaches with my soup.

26:56.450 --> 26:57.952
Specialty of the house.

26:58.202 --> 26:59.912
You about ready to leave?

27:01.080 --> 27:03.165
Not under your terms.

27:03.416 --> 27:06.919
- But I've got some advice for you.
- Yeah? What's that?

27:07.169 --> 27:11.382
Nobody's even gonna start to move
that herd out without drovers.

27:11.632 --> 27:14.343
- My Comanches can handle it.
- Cavalry?

27:14.552 --> 27:16.929
Top riders. Fought under Jeb Stuart.

27:18.139 --> 27:20.266
Any Texans among them? Cowhands?

27:20.850 --> 27:22.351
They're Virginians.

27:22.601 --> 27:26.689
And there's no damn thing anybody
can do on a horse they can't match.

27:28.315 --> 27:31.694
No, except maybe drive a cow
out of a closet.

27:32.611 --> 27:34.989
Takes a long time to train a drover.

27:37.116 --> 27:38.367
Jailer!

27:38.826 --> 27:40.244
Open up.

27:41.996 --> 27:46.959
Mr. Kelly, your education
has been sadly neglected.

28:00.973 --> 28:02.266
Not bad.

28:02.516 --> 28:04.852
But you're not charging the enemy.

28:05.102 --> 28:08.606
You're pushing cattle.
For that, you need trained cowboys.

28:08.814 --> 28:11.025
- Now look...
- These is warhorses, mister.

28:11.275 --> 28:13.819
I reckon they can handle
them little old cows.

28:16.489 --> 28:17.782
All right, lieutenant.

28:18.032 --> 28:22.995
Take your warhorses and push those
little old cows into that back corral.

28:23.204 --> 28:25.081
With your permission, colonel?

28:33.506 --> 28:34.590
Move, cow.

28:38.636 --> 28:40.513
Come on, cows! Get in there!

28:40.763 --> 28:43.015
You darn fool cows, get in there!

28:43.516 --> 28:45.685
Come on, get in there!

28:46.227 --> 28:48.229
You darn fool cows, get in there!

28:51.357 --> 28:55.236
Colonel, where the hell you get these
cows? From an old ladies' home?

28:55.486 --> 28:56.987
Move them out!

28:59.240 --> 29:02.535
Get on! Get out of here! Get out of here!

29:16.882 --> 29:18.676
All right, you darn fool cow!

29:38.320 --> 29:39.530
Come on!

29:52.209 --> 29:54.962
Get out of my way! Go on! Move along there!

29:56.464 --> 29:57.506
Watch out!

30:04.764 --> 30:07.058
- Sound retreat.
- What's that, sir?

30:07.266 --> 30:10.603
- I said sound retreat!
- Yes, sir.

30:21.072 --> 30:22.698
Close the gate.

30:22.948 --> 30:25.618
Get those cattle! Go on, get them.

30:30.664 --> 30:31.791
Now, listen:

30:32.041 --> 30:36.921
There are 2500 head of Mexican
range-bred steers on that plantation...

30:37.171 --> 30:41.676
...stupid, temperamental and a lot more
vicious than anything you've got here.

30:42.677 --> 30:45.429
All right, so we got plenty to learn.

30:46.972 --> 30:48.307
But you can train us.

30:50.267 --> 30:52.937
Damn you, Kelly, you're gonna train us!

30:55.106 --> 30:56.148
Back to jail.

31:08.369 --> 31:10.871
Are you coming in or am I going out?

31:11.122 --> 31:13.708
General Lee has approved the raid.

31:13.958 --> 31:16.919
That makes you the only missing link.

31:18.045 --> 31:19.505
Missing's the word.

31:27.013 --> 31:31.308
That's a lot of cash to carry around,
colonel. It'd be safer in a bank.

31:31.517 --> 31:35.271
Matter of fact, I'll give you
permission to open an account in...

31:40.234 --> 31:43.404
They'll be butchering and eating
that herd before long.

31:44.947 --> 31:49.285
I figure you've got no more
than ten days to get us ready.

31:55.166 --> 31:56.751
Burn it all.

31:57.585 --> 32:00.379
Ten days before we start.

32:02.006 --> 32:04.675
God deliver me from dedicated men.

32:16.354 --> 32:18.064
Ten days.

32:31.369 --> 32:34.747
You used to have ten fingers.
Now you got nine.

32:34.997 --> 32:36.832
Tomorrow, you'll have eight.

32:37.083 --> 32:40.252
You stay stubborn, the day after that,
you'll have seven.

32:40.503 --> 32:41.837
The day after that...

32:43.214 --> 32:44.256
...it's up to you.

32:44.757 --> 32:48.594
You decide whether you want to end up
with a pair of stumps...

32:48.844 --> 32:51.555
...or lend us your talent.

32:58.771 --> 33:00.564
You decide.

33:01.565 --> 33:02.608
Get a doctor.

33:08.864 --> 33:11.283
Don't split them up like that. Get them.

33:11.492 --> 33:14.328
All right, get those back.
Get them together.

33:17.123 --> 33:20.584
He drives hard, I'm glad to say.

33:20.793 --> 33:25.214
Don't split them up! Slow down there!
Take it easy with them.

33:26.298 --> 33:28.759
I deplore what happened, colonel.

33:28.968 --> 33:32.805
- However, under the circumstances...
- It was necessary.

33:33.014 --> 33:37.059
Still, there's a time for sandpaper
and a time for silk.

33:37.309 --> 33:41.147
From now on, I think we'd be wise
to cater to his taste.

33:43.024 --> 33:44.358
I want to borrow a hat.

33:45.651 --> 33:48.237
- Tool of the trade.
- Will mine do?

33:49.196 --> 33:54.160
Mr. Kelly, I'd be honoured if you'd
accept the hospitality of my home...

33:54.368 --> 33:56.203
...for the remainder of your visit.

33:56.454 --> 33:59.707
I believe you'd find
the accommodations more cheerful...

33:59.915 --> 34:01.417
...than your present quarters.

34:01.625 --> 34:04.754
- And the bourbon?
- More plentiful.

34:06.464 --> 34:09.967
You gentlemen have a way
of making it hard for me to refuse.

34:12.303 --> 34:13.137
Who am I?

34:13.721 --> 34:17.891
You're a rich land speculator
looking for bargains.

34:18.809 --> 34:22.271
Seems to me I heard you mention
something like that...

34:22.521 --> 34:24.148
...recently.

34:24.982 --> 34:26.067
Satisfactory?

34:26.275 --> 34:30.112
Yes, yes, that would go down well
with anyone who was curious.

34:30.654 --> 34:35.284
Mrs. Townsend is having a soiree
next week. Nothing pretentious.

34:35.868 --> 34:38.746
No, certainly not.
Not in starving Richmond.

34:39.580 --> 34:41.831
I can't offer you a clean shirt...

34:42.041 --> 34:44.210
...but we'll take care of the one you got.

34:44.418 --> 34:45.835
That's thoughtful.

34:47.672 --> 34:49.215
Now watch this.

34:55.471 --> 34:56.806
Slow down.

34:57.348 --> 34:59.600
When he moves to your house...

35:00.643 --> 35:03.145
...one of my men goes with him.

35:03.854 --> 35:05.231
Naturally.

35:14.865 --> 35:18.828
Oh, Mr. Kelly, I couldn't.
I'd love to, but I just couldn't.

35:19.036 --> 35:21.080
- I'm spoken for.
- Loudly?

35:21.288 --> 35:24.458
By a seafaring monster
who can shrivel a girl right up.

35:24.709 --> 35:26.085
Where's he?

35:31.966 --> 35:33.801
Very impressive.

35:42.018 --> 35:44.562
Since you and I are only
going to be friends...

35:44.812 --> 35:47.606
...it's only fair that
you turn me over to her.

35:47.815 --> 35:51.152
Liz Pickering?
You're really running in luck tonight.

35:51.402 --> 35:53.029
- Married?
- Engaged.

35:53.279 --> 35:55.281
It's not the same, is it?

36:01.537 --> 36:04.498
I bet you could tell me,
if you really wanted to.

36:04.749 --> 36:06.125
Military secret.

36:06.375 --> 36:09.879
- Damn the military and their secrets.
- Come on.

36:15.801 --> 36:17.928
I suppose it's very dangerous.

36:18.179 --> 36:20.514
Not as dangerous as you.

36:21.098 --> 36:25.728
The way you look tonight, you could
start pandemonium in the streets.

36:27.021 --> 36:29.065
And that perfume...

36:30.191 --> 36:33.027
But you do prefer horse sweat.

36:33.444 --> 36:36.364
Oh, Tommy, I'm sorry,
but I see you so seldom.

36:36.614 --> 36:39.492
You know, that's what
I hate most about the Yanks.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.994
They keep us apart.

36:42.661 --> 36:47.416
I understand married officers
have more leave than single ones.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.461
But what if one of those nasty old Yanks...

36:50.670 --> 36:52.838
...threw a speck of dust in my other eye?

36:53.089 --> 36:56.300
How would you look leading
a blind man down the street?

36:56.550 --> 36:58.886
As foolish as you sound talking about it.

36:59.095 --> 37:00.137
Thank you.

37:10.439 --> 37:12.024
Who's he?

37:12.650 --> 37:17.071
Rich businessman from Mexico.
Friend of the Harrisons.

37:17.321 --> 37:19.740
But not a friend of yours?

37:20.408 --> 37:21.617
No.

37:21.826 --> 37:24.120
Tom, what's the matter?

37:24.620 --> 37:26.414
I don't know.

37:27.081 --> 37:29.542
I guess the war's the matter.

37:29.792 --> 37:32.211
War's the matter with all of us.

37:36.674 --> 37:40.011
Mr. Kelly, this is
Captain Angus Ferguson of Glasgow.

37:40.261 --> 37:43.097
- Captain.
- Isn't he magnificent?

37:43.556 --> 37:48.102
Aye, it's good when they adore you,
especially when they're half your age.

37:48.310 --> 37:51.897
Or could it be the wee gifts
I bring her in my ship?

37:52.148 --> 37:54.233
The French perfumes and silk nighties?

37:54.483 --> 37:57.820
- Let's dance.
- I'm not used to a ballroom.

37:58.029 --> 38:00.823
There are many stout lads
to stretch your muscles.

38:01.032 --> 38:04.785
If you don't put your arm around me
now, I'll take you up on that.

38:05.661 --> 38:09.373
I will dance the whole night through
with you in my rooms.

38:09.582 --> 38:11.542
Angus, you're a devil.

38:14.045 --> 38:16.797
No use telling her
it's my farewell night, is there?

38:17.048 --> 38:18.924
Not till morning, that is.

38:19.133 --> 38:22.928
Which one of you will help me
make an old sea dog jealous?

38:23.554 --> 38:24.388
Tom.

38:24.638 --> 38:28.768
Rank does have its responsibilities.
Go ahead, darling.

38:31.520 --> 38:35.900
So I weigh anchor tomorrow evening,
courtesy of Secretary Harrison.

38:36.150 --> 38:39.653
After four months wait
and a good deal more effort...

38:39.862 --> 38:42.740
...than a Scotsman cares to spend.

38:43.115 --> 38:45.034
For mercy sakes, no, Mr. Kelly.

38:45.242 --> 38:47.370
That stuff there will distemper a whale.

38:47.620 --> 38:52.541
Here, you take a taste of this.
Blessed nectar from Scotland.

38:52.792 --> 38:56.253
Will you believe it, there are
1000 bottles of that aboard my ship?

38:56.462 --> 38:58.381
Sounds like paradise.

38:58.756 --> 39:01.967
I was commissioned to run it
in here, but then I found...

39:02.176 --> 39:05.304
Confederate money isn't worth
the match to burn it with.

39:05.554 --> 39:07.515
Aye, so I'll take it to New York.

39:08.015 --> 39:12.353
Heavens, Mr. Kelly, don't tell me
the currency there is still wampum.

39:13.062 --> 39:15.231
Mr. Kelly, you have my flask!

39:20.486 --> 39:23.447
If I may suggest, Miss Pickering,
the punch is pale.

39:23.698 --> 39:25.241
This will improve the colour.

39:25.449 --> 39:27.993
You're gallant enough to be a Virginian.

39:28.619 --> 39:32.164
And your beauty goes beyond
the bounds of geography.

39:32.415 --> 39:33.999
I'm Alvarez Kelly.

39:34.208 --> 39:37.003
And you've learned my name
and a few particulars.

39:37.211 --> 39:38.421
Only one.

39:38.713 --> 39:40.756
You've shortchanged yourself.

39:40.965 --> 39:43.009
You could remedy that.

39:46.595 --> 39:48.556
Are you any kind of gambler, Kelly?

39:48.806 --> 39:51.142
I've lost my last few bets.

39:51.976 --> 39:53.519
Will you come to my house?

39:54.562 --> 39:58.024
I need some advice that
can't very well be given here.

40:02.987 --> 40:04.030
What time?

40:04.780 --> 40:07.199
Midnight, number 19, Royall Street.

40:07.450 --> 40:09.910
Make sure there's no carriage outside.

40:10.536 --> 40:13.456
Why, Mr. Kelly, whatever
happened to your hand?

40:14.206 --> 40:16.167
One of the bets I lost.

40:18.669 --> 40:21.213
Darling, I think he's rather charming.

40:21.464 --> 40:22.673
Yeah.

40:24.717 --> 40:28.471
- You understand?
- Playing with fire, aren't you, lad?

40:30.306 --> 40:32.224
It's not my house.

40:54.205 --> 40:55.998
Now, follow me.

40:56.624 --> 40:59.960
With all of the beautiful women
that were here tonight...

41:00.961 --> 41:03.631
...the result is
I don't feel much like sleeping.

41:03.881 --> 41:05.383
You know what I mean?

41:09.178 --> 41:13.933
I don't know how to put it to your
delicate ears, but in Richmond there...

41:15.184 --> 41:17.895
There must be a house of joy.

41:19.438 --> 41:21.148
There's a few.

41:21.399 --> 41:24.151
Now, let me guess what your orders were.

41:25.820 --> 41:27.738
Let him do what he wants...

41:27.988 --> 41:31.033
...but don't let him
out of your sight. Right?

41:34.412 --> 41:37.790
Well, let's be off. Two men of the world.

41:51.846 --> 41:54.390
You ever seen him before?

41:54.640 --> 41:57.351
No, but I wish I had.

42:03.315 --> 42:05.443
Kelly, you might not like these women.

42:05.651 --> 42:09.864
I understand that the Mexicans
like their women fat and dumpy.

42:10.114 --> 42:12.658
Relax, Hatcher, you can't
make me angry tonight.

42:12.908 --> 42:15.161
What part of Mexico, amigo?

42:15.411 --> 42:17.204
Durango, amigo.

42:21.959 --> 42:23.210
You lonely?

42:23.669 --> 42:25.254
Not really.

42:27.006 --> 42:28.174
Friendly?

42:28.466 --> 42:29.842
Not very.

42:30.509 --> 42:31.719
Thirsty?

42:32.386 --> 42:34.055
Not especially.

42:35.681 --> 42:37.350
You're the one I want.

42:38.392 --> 42:40.061
A bottle of your best wine.

42:46.901 --> 42:50.696
- This is where I draw the line.
- I'll wait.

42:51.989 --> 42:53.616
May take all night.

43:13.969 --> 43:15.930
Should I take it off?

43:17.765 --> 43:19.100
The wedding ring.

43:19.308 --> 43:23.229
Some like it on, some like it off.
You men are peculiar.

43:29.527 --> 43:31.779
What do you do in case of fire?

43:33.322 --> 43:35.408
I don't know, we never had one.

43:37.201 --> 43:39.495
Well, suppose you had one right now.

43:41.330 --> 43:44.625
There's a window with
a big, old wisteria vine right by it.

43:44.875 --> 43:46.168
Show me.

44:00.016 --> 44:03.477
Now, look, I want you
to stay here all night...

44:08.149 --> 44:09.984
...and improve your mind.

44:10.192 --> 44:12.445
Your body's already perfect.

44:20.953 --> 44:22.455
Come in, sir.

44:27.418 --> 44:30.588
Miss Pickering will be down
in a minute, sir.

44:50.858 --> 44:53.944
My Japanese room. Uncluttered.

44:58.699 --> 45:00.618
Does she have to stay here?

45:01.452 --> 45:03.537
You can go to bed now, Ellie.

45:11.837 --> 45:15.216
Why, Kelly, whatever are you thinking of?

45:15.716 --> 45:17.927
I was thinking there might be...

45:18.135 --> 45:20.846
...some chimney sweeps
up there in grey uniforms.

45:21.472 --> 45:24.642
I've grown to expect anything
from Southern belles.

45:24.850 --> 45:28.354
I'm not a Southern belle.
I'm Liz Pickering.

45:29.605 --> 45:32.358
This house was something
quite special in its day.

45:32.608 --> 45:34.443
Sorry you couldn't have seen it.

45:34.652 --> 45:37.321
Used to be a lovely miniature
over the mantle.

45:37.571 --> 45:41.283
Till last week. It paid for
the gown I wore this evening.

45:42.118 --> 45:45.663
I don't know why you asked me here,
but it was not to pity you.

45:46.539 --> 45:50.418
Hardly. Pity is the real
empty room I despise.

45:55.256 --> 45:57.341
I amuse you, Kelly?

45:58.259 --> 46:00.261
It's too early to tell.

46:00.720 --> 46:03.514
Well, we're getting older by the minute.

46:03.764 --> 46:06.809
Would you like to drink that
where it's more comfortable?

46:13.065 --> 46:17.778
Whatever your friend's got,
he ought to market it, huh?

46:18.029 --> 46:19.280
Well, good night.

46:19.739 --> 46:22.783
Wherever did you get wine
at this time of night?

46:23.451 --> 46:25.494
Ask me no questions.

46:26.704 --> 46:29.707
Haven't tasted anything so good
since the war began.

46:31.334 --> 46:34.879
You should've seen that too, Kelly.
It was grand.

46:35.129 --> 46:38.007
That was the year Tom Rossiter
and I became engaged.

46:38.257 --> 46:40.509
The year the boys went off singing.

46:41.010 --> 46:42.595
I begged Tommy to marry me.

46:42.845 --> 46:45.348
It wasn't very ladylike, but I begged him.

46:45.598 --> 46:47.600
I loved him so much.

46:48.809 --> 46:51.520
But he was noble, he had principal.

46:51.729 --> 46:54.065
Said he couldn't risk leaving me a widow.

46:55.483 --> 46:57.818
The second and the third years...

46:58.402 --> 47:00.529
...the singing somehow stopped.

47:01.781 --> 47:03.908
I still wanted Tommy to marry me.

47:04.158 --> 47:07.203
He'd lost an eye by then,
but that didn't matter.

47:07.703 --> 47:09.330
But he was nobler than ever.

47:09.538 --> 47:13.459
Said it might be an arm next or a leg.

47:15.836 --> 47:18.673
Those were the years of frustration.

47:20.132 --> 47:21.801
Then tonight...

47:22.927 --> 47:26.013
Tonight I realized what he feared the most.

47:26.222 --> 47:27.598
Losing his sight.

47:33.729 --> 47:36.190
Tom Rossiter is right.

47:36.649 --> 47:39.735
I couldn't stand to live with half a man.

47:40.861 --> 47:44.323
God, Kelly. It must be
some hideous failing in me.

47:45.241 --> 47:49.537
I'm so sick and tired to death
of all the fighting and killing...

47:49.745 --> 47:53.499
...and trying to be brave
and patient over a lost cause.

47:56.419 --> 47:59.171
So then we come to the fourth year.

47:59.380 --> 48:01.632
The year of temptation.

48:18.315 --> 48:21.861
Thank God you're not another one
of those honourable men.

48:22.111 --> 48:25.614
I've spent my life
surrounded by honourable men.

48:26.407 --> 48:29.368
Enjoying myself is one of my weaknesses.

48:30.244 --> 48:33.748
I guess people like us
have our own kind of honour.

48:40.588 --> 48:43.758
It's not your advice I want, Kelly.
It's your money.

48:50.306 --> 48:53.601
- House mortgaged?
- I've been asked to vacate.

48:53.851 --> 48:55.644
Any other assets?

48:57.521 --> 48:58.606
Myself.

48:58.814 --> 49:00.649
To buy another dress?

49:01.650 --> 49:04.403
I want you to help me get out of Richmond.

49:07.615 --> 49:08.991
At the moment, impossible.

49:09.241 --> 49:10.743
Nothing's impossible for you...

49:11.243 --> 49:14.372
The minute our good colonel
found out I was missing...

49:14.580 --> 49:18.626
...he'd send a regiment after me.
I wouldn't make it to the city limits.

49:18.834 --> 49:20.461
Tom and you?

49:22.380 --> 49:25.508
- You're not what you're supposed to be.
- Who is?

49:25.716 --> 49:27.677
Then why did you come here tonight?

49:28.636 --> 49:30.054
Many reasons.

49:33.182 --> 49:35.685
Mainly because you were his girl.

49:37.436 --> 49:39.855
Only now, I find out you're not.

49:43.776 --> 49:48.656
If I could manage something for you,
would you be willing to go anywhere?

49:48.906 --> 49:49.949
Anywhere.

49:50.282 --> 49:51.951
There's a chance.

49:53.285 --> 49:55.079
Just a chance.

49:55.913 --> 49:57.456
Then you will try?

49:59.125 --> 50:00.835
Yes, I'll try.

50:02.128 --> 50:04.839
Kelly, I think we ought to drink to that.

50:05.047 --> 50:07.800
I think we should.
I promised a friend that...

50:08.384 --> 50:10.511
...this might take all night.

50:11.429 --> 50:15.307
I wouldn't make a liar out of you
for anything in the world.

50:20.521 --> 50:23.649
Now, the main thing to remember is that...

50:23.941 --> 50:25.776
...cattle are like women.

50:25.985 --> 50:27.737
Sometimes you have to be firm.

50:28.112 --> 50:30.364
Sometimes you have to be gentle.

50:31.240 --> 50:34.702
And sometimes you have to give them
a slap on the rump.

50:34.910 --> 50:36.579
Your pistol, captain.

50:48.758 --> 50:53.679
Now that's just a reminder that
the sound of gunfire spooks cattle.

50:53.971 --> 50:57.058
A sound that's practically
guaranteed on our venture.

50:59.602 --> 51:02.021
All right, now start singing, captain.

51:02.313 --> 51:03.939
That's right. Sing.

51:04.190 --> 51:07.193
Music's the best medicine
for scared animals.

51:07.401 --> 51:08.527
Now, look here.

51:08.944 --> 51:10.738
The man said sing!

51:11.822 --> 51:13.074
Yes, sir!

51:13.699 --> 51:15.826
Loud and clear!

51:16.369 --> 51:20.414
I wish I was in the land of cotton.

51:29.632 --> 51:32.259
You, Hatcher, out there and sing.

51:34.345 --> 51:37.890
For the want of one voice,
the battle could be lost.

51:38.683 --> 51:39.975
Sing.

51:41.268 --> 51:43.521
- Damn it, sing!
- Colonel.

51:53.656 --> 51:57.910
You know, I keep wondering
why you came back to us...

51:58.119 --> 52:00.830
...after slipping away from Hatcher.

52:01.330 --> 52:03.124
I have a commitment.

52:04.792 --> 52:07.712
Don't suppose you'd care
to say where you went.

52:10.214 --> 52:11.465
Not yet.

52:20.266 --> 52:22.226
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

52:22.476 --> 52:26.105
Developing a new weapon, Tom?
Trying to scare the Yanks to death?

52:26.355 --> 52:27.648
His idea.

52:27.857 --> 52:29.900
I hope those wailing banshees are ready.

52:30.151 --> 52:32.737
They're ready.
We move tonight, on schedule.

52:32.945 --> 52:34.822
I know your opinion, I want his.

52:35.072 --> 52:37.575
What about it? Can the men manage the herd?

52:37.783 --> 52:41.037
If he would keep after them
so that the men sing on key...

52:41.245 --> 52:43.622
You're beginning to annoy me, Mr. Kelly.

52:44.623 --> 52:46.834
To the point of refusing my services?

52:47.043 --> 52:49.837
Mr. Kelly, I'd give you
the Richmond symphony...

52:50.046 --> 52:52.214
...if they weren't already in the army.

52:52.631 --> 52:54.592
Polish up your contralto, Tom...

52:54.800 --> 52:57.553
...and I'll notify General Lee
you're set to go.

53:01.599 --> 53:04.769
Carry on. I'm going back to town.

53:05.019 --> 53:09.023
Nothing like a bath, a bite to eat
and a bottle of whiskey before battle.

53:28.084 --> 53:29.710
- Reception.
- Yes, sir?

53:29.919 --> 53:32.797
My name is Kelly.
Captain Ferguson is expecting me.

53:33.005 --> 53:34.882
Tell him I'm in the dining room.

53:35.132 --> 53:37.176
I shall tend to that, Mr. Kelly.

54:00.199 --> 54:01.867
I'd like a double whiskey.

54:02.743 --> 54:07.081
- Make that two. One for the captain.
- Mr. Kelly.

54:09.041 --> 54:11.293
- Hope I didn't disturb you.
- Not at all.

54:11.544 --> 54:13.337
I was just packing my gear.

54:13.546 --> 54:17.008
- Getting ready to shove off.
- Aye, that I am. At nightfall.

54:17.800 --> 54:20.636
Now, what can I do for you?

54:22.388 --> 54:24.181
Book a passenger. A lady.

54:26.142 --> 54:27.727
Anyone I might know?

54:27.977 --> 54:29.603
Beside the point.

54:30.104 --> 54:31.689
And yourself.

54:35.651 --> 54:36.902
No.

54:37.820 --> 54:41.532
Now, the Athena is a broad ship,
but she's tiny.

54:41.782 --> 54:43.367
I don't think...

54:48.998 --> 54:50.875
Two thousand.

54:51.667 --> 54:55.504
On the other hand, I am a man
with no contempt for money at all.

54:56.081 --> 54:59.459
And the advantage of being able
to tell a beautiful lady...

54:59.709 --> 55:02.754
...magnificent lies
all the way to New York.

55:06.091 --> 55:09.010
Nineteen Royall Street. She'll be waiting.

55:09.219 --> 55:11.721
Alone, mind. No maidservants.

55:11.930 --> 55:13.181
Alone.

55:20.980 --> 55:22.399
With maidservant.

55:27.946 --> 55:29.864
Bon voyage, captain.

55:32.784 --> 55:35.704
And good luck to you, Mr. Kelly.

55:46.756 --> 55:48.425
It's done.

55:48.717 --> 55:51.344
And you halfway wish it weren't.

55:51.970 --> 55:53.638
You're scared.

55:54.305 --> 55:58.893
And if you weren't a proud person and
in a public place, you'd be crying.

55:59.144 --> 56:00.311
Like a baby.

56:01.396 --> 56:03.023
It's quite a gamble.

56:04.357 --> 56:06.401
You don't have to go through with it.

56:06.651 --> 56:08.653
Oh, yes, I do.

56:09.321 --> 56:12.198
Where I'm going, I don't know
what will become of me.

56:12.407 --> 56:16.369
But if I stay here, I know damn well
what I'll become.

56:17.287 --> 56:22.208
No girl, as pretty or passionate as you,
has a right to such an honest mind.

56:23.335 --> 56:25.712
What I wouldn't give to have you along.

56:27.797 --> 56:29.090
If it's any comfort...

56:29.341 --> 56:32.010
...I would have booked passage, only...

56:32.302 --> 56:33.887
Only what?

56:35.597 --> 56:37.682
In the courtyard is a bloodhound.

56:38.516 --> 56:40.143
Rossiter's.

56:40.352 --> 56:42.645
He can't see you, but don't turn.

56:43.271 --> 56:45.398
When I leave here, he'll follow...

56:45.648 --> 56:48.068
...and I'll let him chase me up a tree.

56:48.360 --> 56:50.570
You stay for a while and then leave.

56:52.530 --> 56:54.658
I've used you. Forgive me for that.

56:56.576 --> 56:58.495
There's nothing to forgive.

56:59.329 --> 57:02.457
As for using me, it seems to be
the national pastime...

57:02.707 --> 57:05.168
...of the Confederate States of America.

57:07.128 --> 57:08.713
Goodbye, Liz.

57:10.256 --> 57:13.093
What a ridiculous way to say goodbye.

57:13.468 --> 57:16.429
Perhaps that's why we'll
remember it longer.

57:17.222 --> 57:21.434
Goodbye, Kelly. I'll be throwing you
kisses from the rail tonight.

57:40.078 --> 57:43.540
Yes, as I say,
I recognized the man with him...

57:43.790 --> 57:46.376
...as one of Rossiter's Comanches...

57:46.626 --> 57:49.170
...when the two of them
entered the bordello.

57:50.088 --> 57:54.009
I don't avail myself of its services,
you understand, general.

57:54.259 --> 57:56.678
But you'd be amazed how much information...

57:56.886 --> 57:58.138
Get along with it.

57:58.972 --> 58:00.223
Yes, sir.

58:00.432 --> 58:01.725
This morning...

58:01.975 --> 58:05.520
...ear to the ground, I learned
from one of Harrison's servants...

58:05.770 --> 58:09.524
...that Kelly had been spending
his days at the Comanche camp.

58:09.774 --> 58:12.652
And this afternoon, my vigilance paid off.

58:12.902 --> 58:16.489
This afternoon, gentlemen,
he made contact with one...

58:16.740 --> 58:21.077
...Captain Ferguson,
a well-known blockade runner.

58:21.703 --> 58:23.705
Well, need I spell it out?

58:24.289 --> 58:26.166
If it's not asking too much.

58:26.458 --> 58:28.001
No, sir, not at all.

58:28.251 --> 58:31.671
He is not looking for cheap land,
as he pretends.

58:32.213 --> 58:34.424
No, gentlemen. Alvarez Kelly...

58:34.674 --> 58:37.886
...is planning to import
herds of Mexican beef...

58:38.136 --> 58:40.221
...into the Southern states by sea.

58:41.598 --> 58:43.850
How long have you been in this business?

58:44.267 --> 58:45.518
Four years.

58:46.311 --> 58:47.354
Too long.

58:48.146 --> 58:49.189
I beg your pardon?

58:49.856 --> 58:53.234
Your theory is idiotic. Dismissed.

58:54.235 --> 58:57.197
- What's that?
- I said, you're dismissed.

58:57.447 --> 58:58.823
Out!

59:00.325 --> 59:02.369
As you wish, sir.

59:09.417 --> 59:11.127
Amusing picture.

59:11.544 --> 59:15.882
Boatload of seasick cows, all standing
with their heads over the rail.

59:20.512 --> 59:22.514
Not priceless, Steadman?

59:22.764 --> 59:23.890
Yes, sir.

59:24.224 --> 59:25.475
But you're troubled.

59:26.768 --> 59:30.772
Sir, I think there's something
in what Mclntyre was saying.

59:31.022 --> 59:33.566
Shipping cows from Mexico?

59:33.817 --> 59:36.986
No, sir. Cattle closer to home.

59:37.445 --> 59:40.865
Are we being exposed to the
legal mind at work, major?

59:41.116 --> 59:44.119
It's Kelly spending all that time
with Rossiter.

59:44.369 --> 59:46.579
Are you suggesting Kelly and Rossiter...

59:46.830 --> 59:49.374
...are concocting a scheme
to steal your herd?

59:54.212 --> 59:55.255
Yes, sir.

59:56.423 --> 59:59.718
Grant has an army around Richmond.

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:03.471
Rossiter has to get his cavalry out...

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.348
...and the cattle in.

01:00:07.892 --> 01:00:10.562
Now, plead your case.

01:00:16.443 --> 01:00:17.610
Anything else?

01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:22.032
Request the general assign me
additional troops.

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:26.411
If anybody tries to steal
one of your precious cows...

01:00:26.619 --> 01:00:29.372
...just telegraph me.
I promise to come a-running.

01:00:37.297 --> 01:00:39.549
Get the officers in here.

01:00:41.926 --> 01:00:45.013
Colonel Kelly will stay with me.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.933
Colonel, huh?

01:00:49.559 --> 01:00:52.479
I just made you lieutenant colonel...

01:00:52.729 --> 01:00:54.814
...for the period of the raid.

01:00:55.065 --> 01:00:58.318
Aren't you taking a risk,
giving me that kind of authority?

01:00:58.526 --> 01:01:03.323
When we get those cattle,
I'll be needing you to crack the whip.

01:01:12.999 --> 01:01:14.793
You want to share the fun?

01:01:15.293 --> 01:01:19.381
I doubt if you'd appreciate it.

01:01:20.674 --> 01:01:22.717
- I like to laugh.
- I know you do.

01:01:22.926 --> 01:01:26.471
Of course, this harebrained scheme
is enough to make any man giddy.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:30.642
Well, it's not my scheme making you giddy.

01:01:32.143 --> 01:01:33.978
It's yours.

01:01:36.147 --> 01:01:39.109
- How many guesses do I get?
- You don't need any.

01:01:39.359 --> 01:01:43.071
That's bright of you, though,
not to try to shake Hatcher off...

01:01:43.321 --> 01:01:45.323
...a second time.

01:01:48.868 --> 01:01:51.162
I wouldn't do a foolish thing like that.

01:01:51.746 --> 01:01:53.206
I bet you wouldn't.

01:01:53.456 --> 01:01:55.750
My goodness.

01:01:55.959 --> 01:01:58.628
Parting with all that money.

01:01:58.878 --> 01:02:00.463
For nothing.

01:02:01.089 --> 01:02:02.549
It's a pity.

01:02:02.757 --> 01:02:06.511
Considering what money means to you.

01:02:09.639 --> 01:02:11.850
I think it went for a good purpose.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.810
I'm sure of that.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.563
I can see Ferguson donating it to a fund...

01:02:16.813 --> 01:02:19.024
...for needy Scotchmen.

01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:26.323
- You don't know how funny.
- It's too late.

01:02:27.449 --> 01:02:29.868
- It is?
- Sure, his ship has sailed.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.413
- I imagine it has.
- Didn't take you with him.

01:02:37.542 --> 01:02:39.461
No, but he took Liz.

01:02:43.089 --> 01:02:44.466
What?

01:02:44.758 --> 01:02:46.634
I said, he took your girl.

01:02:55.769 --> 01:02:58.855
Now how many guesses do I get?

01:03:08.657 --> 01:03:11.409
You went to Royall Street, didn't you?

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:16.373
That money to Ferguson...

01:03:17.707 --> 01:03:19.626
...for her passage.

01:03:19.876 --> 01:03:21.127
Not yours.

01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:39.729
Damn you, Kelly! Why?

01:03:41.022 --> 01:03:43.733
Let's just say I was
getting even with someone...

01:03:43.983 --> 01:03:45.652
...for shooting a finger off.

01:03:47.112 --> 01:03:50.407
I don't know how Liz could have
anything to do with you!

01:03:50.657 --> 01:03:54.577
Listen, you silly ass!
She's a female not a crinoline saint!

01:03:54.828 --> 01:03:59.666
If you'd been as intent on pleasing her
as serving the cause, she'd be with you.

01:03:59.916 --> 01:04:02.168
Did you please her, Kelly?

01:04:04.629 --> 01:04:07.257
I've got some advice for you, Rossiter.

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:10.593
Just close the book on this one.

01:04:10.969 --> 01:04:13.096
I think I'll just do that.

01:04:13.346 --> 01:04:15.348
- I'll close it...
- Colonel...

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.975
Reporting as ordered.

01:04:20.895 --> 01:04:22.689
All right, gather around.

01:04:34.909 --> 01:04:38.246
The tricky business
is to get past Grant's line.

01:04:38.496 --> 01:04:41.041
So we'll swing way out around it.

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:43.126
Fewer sentries.

01:04:43.626 --> 01:04:46.880
We'll head for his back door,
through Blackwater Swamp.

01:04:47.088 --> 01:04:49.174
About a 50-mile route.

01:04:49.799 --> 01:04:52.302
- If we can...
- Colonel? Pardon me, sir.

01:04:52.552 --> 01:04:54.971
You're saying we'll plow through
Blackwater?

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.432
- That's one big swamp.
- That's my gamble.

01:04:57.682 --> 01:05:01.102
Nobody will expect us, because
nobody'd believe we could cross.

01:05:01.353 --> 01:05:04.397
If we can get to the plantation
by tomorrow night...

01:05:04.606 --> 01:05:06.524
...we'll hide till dawn...

01:05:06.775 --> 01:05:09.402
...take care of whatever Yanks are there.

01:05:10.362 --> 01:05:11.946
- And then...
- I crack the whip.

01:05:14.658 --> 01:05:16.201
That's what I'm here for.

01:05:19.204 --> 01:05:23.375
Cavalry under General Hampton
will cover our flank on the return.

01:05:23.667 --> 01:05:28.421
General Lee's ordered a diversionary
attack to hold the enemy's attention.

01:05:28.672 --> 01:05:30.882
His artillery will be our sig...

01:05:32.092 --> 01:05:34.886
That's it. That's Lee's artillery.

01:05:35.136 --> 01:05:37.972
Our signal to ride. Let's go.

01:05:40.642 --> 01:05:43.186
Bugler, call the men!

01:05:43.853 --> 01:05:45.689
Colonel Kelly.

01:05:57.033 --> 01:05:59.452
That book's not closed...

01:05:59.828 --> 01:06:01.329
...yet.

01:06:14.884 --> 01:06:17.012
If anything happens to me...

01:06:17.262 --> 01:06:19.139
...kill him.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:08.772 --> 01:07:11.608
Beaurider, ride across. Try it.

01:07:35.965 --> 01:07:38.093
Old friends are the fairest.

01:07:38.885 --> 01:07:41.763
General Rossiter detailed me as your aide.

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.600
Aide?

01:07:47.727 --> 01:07:49.145
Light.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.662
Next time, remember...

01:08:05.912 --> 01:08:09.791
...never put the flame to the cigar.
A half an inch under.

01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:14.004
You can learn about things like that
in your spare time...

01:08:14.254 --> 01:08:16.256
...while you're polishing my boots.

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:24.680
Looks fine, sir.

01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:27.975
- All right. Take them across.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:28.225 --> 01:08:30.562
Troops, full ahead.

01:08:54.252 --> 01:08:57.589
Our luck's holding out.
That bridge is sound as a bell.

01:08:58.256 --> 01:09:01.301
- I don't think so.
- They're crossing it.

01:09:01.926 --> 01:09:05.638
Well-trained cavalrymen.
Slow their horses down and spread out.

01:09:06.096 --> 01:09:08.390
What are you trying to say?

01:09:09.017 --> 01:09:12.979
You ought to know cattle
don't spread out. They jam together.

01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:16.232
And when they do,
they'll outweigh your horses 10-to-1.

01:09:16.483 --> 01:09:20.069
This will come apart before
the first steer hits the other side.

01:09:24.741 --> 01:09:28.243
Williams, how long will it take you
to shore up this bridge?

01:09:28.495 --> 01:09:30.913
The rest of today and most of tomorrow.

01:09:31.122 --> 01:09:32.999
You got till midnight.

01:09:33.249 --> 01:09:34.667
Yes, sir.

01:09:37.879 --> 01:09:40.423
Obliged, Mr. Kelly...

01:09:40.674 --> 01:09:43.676
...for being so considerate of our problem.

01:09:44.551 --> 01:09:46.345
My problem too.

01:09:47.055 --> 01:09:48.973
I want to get Kelly across.

01:09:50.475 --> 01:09:51.975
Yeah.

01:10:01.027 --> 01:10:02.404
Move it!

01:10:22.632 --> 01:10:24.300
Timber!

01:13:11.176 --> 01:13:14.888
- Can you finish by midnight?
- No, sir. We can't. But we will.

01:13:15.096 --> 01:13:16.973
Bring the column when you're done.

01:13:17.182 --> 01:13:20.310
Farrow will meet you
with word about the Yanks.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.854
If I run into trouble, you take command.

01:13:23.104 --> 01:13:25.940
And the herd. Let's go!

01:13:33.323 --> 01:13:35.742
Is this the best way you could pick?

01:13:35.992 --> 01:13:38.495
Yep. The best.

01:13:38.745 --> 01:13:41.164
Because it's the most improbable.

01:13:41.373 --> 01:13:45.752
Can you drive the cattle through here?
Solid spine, about 50 yards wide...

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.046
...and the Yanks know nothing about it?

01:13:49.047 --> 01:13:51.216
If we keep the herd tight.

01:13:51.466 --> 01:13:53.468
That's your job.

01:14:03.269 --> 01:14:04.729
Farrow.

01:14:05.146 --> 01:14:06.398
Beaurider.

01:14:09.192 --> 01:14:10.568
Hatcher.

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.697
Just make sure you get there before dawn.

01:14:14.072 --> 01:14:15.365
Come on.

01:14:25.875 --> 01:14:29.546
Don't you ever get tired
of being a chaperone?

01:14:30.171 --> 01:14:31.423
I like it.

01:14:32.674 --> 01:14:34.134
You know why?

01:14:34.426 --> 01:14:35.802
Tell me.

01:14:36.511 --> 01:14:38.930
I figure you might try once more.

01:14:40.473 --> 01:14:42.475
You do that, Kelly.

01:14:42.684 --> 01:14:44.352
Anytime you want to.

01:14:44.602 --> 01:14:45.854
Just feel free.

01:15:29.439 --> 01:15:32.317
I haven't been in this place for years.

01:15:33.026 --> 01:15:37.322
Charity and I were kids, we used to
sleep down here. Steal fruit.

01:16:00.345 --> 01:16:05.058
When I get there, pick up a cone
and throw it. And watch him.

01:16:36.297 --> 01:16:37.590
Go on.

01:16:59.112 --> 01:17:00.780
Hatcher, wait for me.

01:17:21.134 --> 01:17:22.385
I'll take that.

01:17:24.554 --> 01:17:26.389
Not even you...

01:17:27.474 --> 01:17:29.225
...would shoot this close in.

01:17:37.901 --> 01:17:39.319
Hurry up.

01:17:40.445 --> 01:17:43.114
- How many men?
- Two hundred at least.

01:17:43.365 --> 01:17:45.408
Any idea what regiment they are?

01:17:45.659 --> 01:17:47.369
Pennsylvania 12th, and proud.

01:17:48.078 --> 01:17:50.205
We fought them in the wilderness.

01:17:50.455 --> 01:17:53.083
They're equipped with new repeating rifles.

01:17:53.541 --> 01:17:56.711
- Where are they bunked down?
- Down by the old corral.

01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:58.213
The old corral.

01:17:58.463 --> 01:17:59.756
Farrow.

01:18:01.424 --> 01:18:04.219
Charity. Apple core.

01:18:05.387 --> 01:18:06.596
Baltimore.

01:18:07.013 --> 01:18:08.264
Who's your friend?

01:18:08.598 --> 01:18:09.974
Tom.

01:18:10.183 --> 01:18:12.602
- Where's Steadman?
- Overseer's cottage.

01:18:12.852 --> 01:18:15.230
- Telegraph line?
- At the cottage.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.983
Cut it. As far from the cottage as you can.

01:18:19.234 --> 01:18:22.696
Obliged, Charity. You've done
your homework real well.

01:18:22.904 --> 01:18:24.155
Come on.

01:18:52.392 --> 01:18:54.602
- Hatcher?
- Here.

01:19:07.699 --> 01:19:10.660
I hate to see loose guns lying around.

01:19:12.412 --> 01:19:14.414
I'm glad you got it.

01:19:15.206 --> 01:19:19.002
It'll make me feel better
when I blow your guts out.

01:19:19.461 --> 01:19:22.881
You'd better be faster than
these two clowns you got here.

01:19:23.131 --> 01:19:25.258
You could make me a Yankee hero.

01:19:32.307 --> 01:19:36.102
He was near the fence, major.
We ordered him to halt. He ran.

01:19:41.107 --> 01:19:43.651
- Should we notify Kautz?
- And tell him what?

01:19:43.902 --> 01:19:45.487
- Reb spy.
- One man.

01:19:45.737 --> 01:19:50.492
Unless we can produce the whole of
Hapham's cavalry, he'll just laugh.

01:19:50.784 --> 01:19:53.620
- Corporal, get the servants.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:57.248 --> 01:19:58.458
Beaurider.

01:19:58.708 --> 01:20:00.085
Prisoner?

01:20:00.794 --> 01:20:02.170
He's dead.

01:20:03.713 --> 01:20:06.675
Question is, did he cut that wire?

01:20:13.682 --> 01:20:15.100
Ruth.

01:20:17.185 --> 01:20:18.687
You recognize him?

01:20:18.937 --> 01:20:20.313
No, sir.

01:20:21.731 --> 01:20:22.816
You sure?

01:20:23.316 --> 01:20:25.944
I ain't never seen him before in my life.

01:20:28.071 --> 01:20:29.280
Men?

01:20:29.698 --> 01:20:33.284
- Never laid eyes on him, master.
- No, sir.

01:20:35.245 --> 01:20:36.287
Anybody else?

01:20:37.831 --> 01:20:39.332
I don't understand.

01:20:41.042 --> 01:20:43.253
We're down here fighting for you.

01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:45.547
Fighting to free you.

01:20:46.548 --> 01:20:49.509
Ruth, how can you be so loyal...

01:20:49.759 --> 01:20:52.345
...to someone who wants
to keep you a slave?

01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:58.768
Maybe that's the worst of them.

01:21:01.896 --> 01:21:03.898
All right, bury him.

01:21:07.402 --> 01:21:09.112
Wait.

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.834
Apples? This time of year?

01:21:26.463 --> 01:21:28.506
Storage apples.

01:21:29.632 --> 01:21:31.426
From a fruit cellar.

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.561
Game's up!

01:21:41.811 --> 01:21:43.521
Everybody out!

01:21:45.482 --> 01:21:47.901
All right, come on out with your hands up!

01:21:50.904 --> 01:21:52.072
Come on out!

01:21:53.281 --> 01:21:54.949
Come out or we'll fire!

01:21:55.450 --> 01:21:57.077
Hands up! Up!

01:21:59.996 --> 01:22:02.707
You put that gun down, please.

01:22:05.710 --> 01:22:07.212
Well, Mr. Kelly.

01:22:22.602 --> 01:22:24.396
Sergeant...

01:22:25.855 --> 01:22:27.524
Lieutenant, sir.

01:22:32.278 --> 01:22:33.405
No!

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:41.079
After him! Webster, telegraph line,
make sure it's cut!

01:22:42.622 --> 01:22:44.249
Farrow, the Yanks.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.795
Now, you just hold it here, Kelly.
This is where I put you to work.

01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:52.799
Let's get these Yanks out of here.
Come on, get going!

01:23:07.188 --> 01:23:09.733
Rise and shine, gents! Get up! Come on!

01:23:09.983 --> 01:23:11.401
Up and at them, blue boy.

01:23:11.651 --> 01:23:13.069
Easy.

01:23:13.361 --> 01:23:14.279
All right, out.

01:23:14.946 --> 01:23:16.406
All right, out!

01:23:19.701 --> 01:23:21.453
Get them in the corral!

01:23:35.383 --> 01:23:37.844
Come on, boys. Let's move that powder.

01:23:38.386 --> 01:23:39.721
Be careful there, Zeb.

01:24:04.663 --> 01:24:06.915
All right. Start moving that herd.

01:24:08.917 --> 01:24:11.628
- You see where Steadman's headed?
- I said, move.

01:24:13.296 --> 01:24:16.716
Listen, you idiot.
Cattle can't make 5 miles an hour.

01:24:16.966 --> 01:24:18.677
You'll be in Yankees up to here.

01:24:18.927 --> 01:24:22.097
- You'll be lucky to get your men out.
- I told you to move!

01:24:23.598 --> 01:24:25.475
No herd, no Kelly.

01:24:41.282 --> 01:24:44.119
It was like playing games
the other night, wasn't it?

01:24:44.369 --> 01:24:46.746
Exciting and honorable.

01:24:48.873 --> 01:24:51.334
How does it strike you now?

01:25:00.885 --> 01:25:03.430
I'll ride point. Williams,
you take the left flank.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.057
Captain Webster, you take the right.

01:25:06.599 --> 01:25:08.852
Would you consider riding drag?

01:25:09.102 --> 01:25:10.395
No.

01:25:10.645 --> 01:25:12.355
I didn't think so.

01:25:12.939 --> 01:25:15.316
All right, move them out!

01:26:07.035 --> 01:26:12.165
There it is, colonel. Just the way
you saw it in that crazy dream.

01:26:22.467 --> 01:26:23.927
With the genera"s permission...

01:26:24.177 --> 01:26:27.555
...I'd like to remind the general
I warned him about this.

01:26:27.847 --> 01:26:29.766
My judgement was correct all along.

01:26:30.016 --> 01:26:31.810
Absolutely correct.

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:35.605
I gambled Lee would risk his cavalry
and he did. He did.

01:26:35.855 --> 01:26:38.400
The herd is big for Rossiter,
and he's big for Hampton.

01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:41.861
- Hampton?
- He was sighted, just as I planned.

01:26:42.112 --> 01:26:44.447
I knew what that beef meant to the Rebs.

01:26:46.282 --> 01:26:48.159
Colonel Jacobs is ready to ride.

01:26:48.368 --> 01:26:50.453
- What's his strength?
- About 6000.

01:26:51.037 --> 01:26:54.958
Excellent. Jacobs is to proceed down
the Jerusalem Plank Road...

01:26:55.208 --> 01:26:58.211
...and if he's fast he'll have
Hampton by the throat.

01:26:58.461 --> 01:27:00.380
Which might never have happened...

01:27:00.630 --> 01:27:03.550
...if I'd listened to your request
for more troops.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.593
What are you waiting for?

01:27:07.345 --> 01:27:08.972
Detect my strategy, major?

01:27:09.222 --> 01:27:10.849
Yes, sir.

01:27:11.099 --> 01:27:13.768
Now, major. Question:

01:27:14.352 --> 01:27:18.314
How do you believe Rossiter expects
to get that herd back to Richmond?

01:27:18.565 --> 01:27:22.902
Well, I'd say he's gonna drive
the cattle into Blackwater Swamp.

01:27:23.153 --> 01:27:24.988
I guess that's how they came...

01:27:25.238 --> 01:27:27.741
...using the bridge at Cook's Crossing.

01:27:27.991 --> 01:27:32.287
Splendid. That's why I'm giving
you my reserves: 300 cavalry...

01:27:33.121 --> 01:27:34.664
...plus a howitzer battery.

01:27:35.582 --> 01:27:36.624
Satisfied?

01:27:38.126 --> 01:27:39.419
Well?

01:27:40.086 --> 01:27:43.882
Yes, sir. That's splendid, sir.

01:27:44.341 --> 01:27:45.633
Yes, sir.

01:28:38.687 --> 01:28:39.979
Herd them in tighter.

01:29:02.961 --> 01:29:04.462
Colonel!

01:29:04.671 --> 01:29:06.131
What is it?

01:29:06.339 --> 01:29:10.135
I couldn't catch him.
Not with no quarter-mile lead.

01:29:12.012 --> 01:29:15.432
Farrow! Take two men, scout ahead.

01:29:15.682 --> 01:29:18.685
Yes, sir. Lanier, Dugot, let's go.

01:29:36.619 --> 01:29:38.038
Yankees!

01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:44.813
Let's get to the colonel. Let's go!

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:05.834
Come on, you stupid hunk of leather!
Get out of here!

01:31:06.084 --> 01:31:08.962
You're miles from the stew pot!

01:31:15.301 --> 01:31:17.262
Come on, move them out of here!

01:31:17.929 --> 01:31:21.099
After a march, they've a right
to a rest and a drink.

01:31:21.558 --> 01:31:23.893
We don't have the time!

01:31:34.612 --> 01:31:35.905
Get over!

01:31:37.115 --> 01:31:38.366
Yankee cavalry.

01:31:38.575 --> 01:31:41.077
They're hustling.
Probably at the bridge now.

01:31:41.328 --> 01:31:43.413
- How many?
- Looked like a full squadron...

01:31:43.663 --> 01:31:45.665
...and a battery of howitzers.

01:31:46.458 --> 01:31:48.376
Can we bypass that bridge?

01:31:48.585 --> 01:31:51.588
Nothing but swamp.
We'd drown every one of them.

01:31:53.381 --> 01:31:55.091
- Williams?
- Yes, sir.

01:31:55.342 --> 01:31:56.760
Drown them.

01:31:57.010 --> 01:31:58.928
Drive them in the swamp.

01:31:59.179 --> 01:32:01.765
At least that'll deny them
the Yankee bellies.

01:32:02.015 --> 01:32:03.808
Yes, sir.

01:32:04.434 --> 01:32:06.353
- And, Williams?
- Yes, sir.

01:32:07.228 --> 01:32:11.941
It does seem a pity to disappoint
those Yanks at the bridge.

01:32:12.192 --> 01:32:13.860
What you got in mind, colonel?

01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:17.072
We'll split in two ranks,
move at them from both sides.

01:32:17.322 --> 01:32:20.116
Holy Mother of God.

01:32:20.367 --> 01:32:24.663
3000 miles to drown in a stinking swamp!

01:32:24.913 --> 01:32:26.748
You make me sick.

01:32:27.957 --> 01:32:30.335
The Virginia Comanches do or die.

01:32:30.919 --> 01:32:33.880
You're long on gallantry
but short on sense.

01:32:34.130 --> 01:32:35.507
We'll talk later.

01:32:35.715 --> 01:32:37.300
You know nothing about cattle.

01:32:37.759 --> 01:32:40.512
- What are you driving at?
- You want them in Richmond?

01:32:40.887 --> 01:32:44.891
You know something, or are you
just blowing hard, as usual?

01:32:45.141 --> 01:32:47.602
You want this herd in Richmond?

01:32:48.061 --> 01:32:50.522
You trying to tell me you know a way?

01:32:50.939 --> 01:32:52.190
I might.

01:32:53.108 --> 01:32:54.693
What's it worth to you?

01:32:55.777 --> 01:32:57.821
What's your price?

01:32:59.114 --> 01:33:01.157
You know what the price is.

01:33:08.873 --> 01:33:10.959
All right, you got it.

01:33:11.334 --> 01:33:13.044
Hatcher...

01:33:13.294 --> 01:33:17.424
...any instructions I gave
regarding Colonel Kelly:

01:33:18.675 --> 01:33:20.176
Cancelled.

01:33:22.804 --> 01:33:24.347
Yes, sir.

01:33:24.597 --> 01:33:26.224
I'm in command now.

01:33:27.267 --> 01:33:28.685
Go ahead.

01:33:29.102 --> 01:33:30.979
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:32.689
How many Yanks did you say?

01:33:32.939 --> 01:33:34.983
I'd say abut 300, sir.

01:33:35.608 --> 01:33:37.485
And about 100 of us.

01:33:39.738 --> 01:33:42.198
2500 head of cattle.

01:33:42.866 --> 01:33:45.994
That makes 2600 for our side.

01:33:46.202 --> 01:33:48.913
We'll divide them up into
groups of 500 each.

01:33:49.122 --> 01:33:53.960
I want an inventory of ammunition.
Assemble your men for instructions.

01:33:54.210 --> 01:33:56.212
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

01:34:00.175 --> 01:34:02.802
This business of command comes easy to me.

01:34:03.053 --> 01:34:04.471
Hatcher.

01:34:08.183 --> 01:34:10.018
You know, sergeant...

01:34:10.268 --> 01:34:14.773
...I'm going to miss your merry smile
and winning ways. Get to work.

01:34:24.658 --> 01:34:26.284
Let's hurry that up.

01:34:39.130 --> 01:34:41.549
Do you still think they'll come this way?

01:34:42.759 --> 01:34:46.513
- Get your men quiet.
- Quiet on the line!

01:34:47.764 --> 01:34:52.352
The funny thing about cattle. You can
hear them like the pounding of surf.

01:35:08.368 --> 01:35:09.911
Come on!

01:35:10.161 --> 01:35:13.164
Move it along! Get them going!

01:35:13.415 --> 01:35:16.543
Move it along! Keep them moving!

01:35:18.962 --> 01:35:20.255
Alert your men.

01:35:20.505 --> 01:35:23.425
Ready on the firing line!

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:56.791
Get them moving!

01:35:57.042 --> 01:35:59.252
All right, split them up!

01:36:17.687 --> 01:36:18.730
Here they come.

01:36:22.359 --> 01:36:23.902
Keep them moving!

01:36:53.556 --> 01:36:55.767
- Shall I fire now?
- No, hold your fire.

01:37:04.609 --> 01:37:06.611
All right, fire! Fire!

01:37:42.439 --> 01:37:45.025
Shoot! Get the cattle! Get the cattle!

01:38:11.134 --> 01:38:13.970
All right, hold, men. Hold!

01:38:15.263 --> 01:38:17.307
Move them over to the right!

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.568
Hold your fire!

01:39:32.799 --> 01:39:34.718
Here's the second group. Move!

01:39:42.767 --> 01:39:45.103
Circle them twice!

01:40:30.774 --> 01:40:34.110
Take it across the bridge. Fast!

01:40:40.325 --> 01:40:42.285
- Williams!
- Yes, sir.

01:40:42.535 --> 01:40:45.372
- Keep them on the run.
- Yes, sir!

01:40:45.622 --> 01:40:47.540
Hatcher!

01:41:13.817 --> 01:41:16.027
Ropes.

01:42:03.533 --> 01:42:05.035
Drop it.

01:42:05.869 --> 01:42:07.537
Swing it over.

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:16.546
Pull the rope.

01:42:22.844 --> 01:42:25.972
Set the next one. Come on, hurry it up!

01:42:53.083 --> 01:42:54.834
Hatcher, lay a trail.

01:42:55.085 --> 01:42:57.045
Yes, sir!

01:43:31.621 --> 01:43:33.915
Get them across the bridge!

01:43:50.807 --> 01:43:53.727
As soon as the last man's over, light it.

01:43:54.477 --> 01:43:55.729
Yes, sir!

01:43:55.937 --> 01:43:57.856
Move them out! Move them over!

01:43:59.315 --> 01:44:01.401
Over to the bridge!

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:04.779
Everybody out! Move!

01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:07.282
Across the bridge!

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:17.292
Come here.
Get me a report of all companies.

01:44:17.542 --> 01:44:19.836
Regroup here. Follow me!

01:45:08.343 --> 01:45:09.594
Hatcher!

01:45:19.604 --> 01:45:24.609
Hey, Mex! Now's your time!

01:46:28.923 --> 01:46:30.633
General Hampton's compliments.

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:33.261
He's got the Union troops contained.

01:46:33.511 --> 01:46:37.223
- It's clear sailing to Richmond.
- That's fine. Just fine.

01:46:38.099 --> 01:46:40.018
We lost about 40 steers.

01:46:40.268 --> 01:46:41.478
That's not bad.

01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:45.357
You got one eye.
Looks like now you got one lung.

01:46:45.607 --> 01:46:49.486
You keep on fighting like this, you'll
wind up with one of everything.

01:46:51.655 --> 01:46:55.742
You seem to manage pretty well yourself.

01:46:56.368 --> 01:46:58.078
For a nine-fingered man.

01:46:58.328 --> 01:46:59.412
Got 20 wounded.

01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:03.708
Eight dead, sir.
Including Farrow and Hatcher.

01:47:05.126 --> 01:47:07.837
Must've dropped Hatcher when
he lit that fuse.

01:47:08.463 --> 01:47:10.382
He timed it well.

01:47:10.632 --> 01:47:13.301
If he'd lit that fuse any earlier, l...

01:47:13.551 --> 01:47:14.844
He timed it fine.

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:16.846
He got chopped down like a hero.

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.306
Yeah.

01:47:18.556 --> 01:47:20.934
We're all heroes.

01:47:21.142 --> 01:47:22.394
Start pushing that herd.

01:47:22.852 --> 01:47:24.145
All right, sir.

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:34.155
Well...

01:47:35.657 --> 01:47:37.659
...I suppose you'd like to be moving on.

01:47:37.867 --> 01:47:40.954
The sooner I get to Richmond,
the quicker I get home.

01:47:41.454 --> 01:47:44.791
Better feel your ground.
You're a wanted man...

01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:48.712
...by the Yanks.

01:47:49.421 --> 01:47:51.089
Kelly?

01:47:52.549 --> 01:47:56.261
I saw some crazy things at that bridge.

01:47:56.511 --> 01:48:01.266
One of them was you, risking your
life to save a Confederate officer.

01:48:02.559 --> 01:48:04.769
Seems to me that was...

01:48:04.978 --> 01:48:08.481
...kind of long on gallantry,
short on sense.

01:48:08.732 --> 01:48:11.067
- Wouldn't you say?
- I try everything on once.

01:48:11.317 --> 01:48:12.318
See if it fits.

01:48:12.569 --> 01:48:15.613
Looked kind of stylish on you.

01:48:17.073 --> 01:48:19.659
I never thought I'd catch
myself saying that.

01:48:22.037 --> 01:48:24.998
Don't worry, I won't try it twice.

01:48:37.594 --> 01:48:40.138
For once, the soldiers of
the Confederacy...

01:48:40.388 --> 01:48:43.141
...and the people of Richmond
would eat their fill.

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:45.268
What General Grant said when he heard...

01:48:45.518 --> 01:48:48.605
...that his prize herd was raided
is unquotable.

01:48:48.855 --> 01:48:52.359
President Lincoln's comment
is a matter of record.

01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:53.777
Lincoln called it.

01:48:53.985 --> 01:48:58.615
"The slickest piece of cattle stealing
I ever heard of. "
