WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:09.835
Okay. Plug her in.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.576
Oh, yay!

00:11.620 --> 00:12.969
- All right. Wonderful.
- Yeah. Yeah!

00:13.013 --> 00:14.797
Your old gazebo's looking
pretty good, huh, Hetty?

00:14.840 --> 00:17.191
Indeed!
Now, get some swans in the lake,

00:17.234 --> 00:19.932
Yeah.and a couple of giraffes
at a dinner party...

00:19.976 --> 00:21.673
It'll be the Gilded Age
all over again.

00:21.717 --> 00:22.848
They love it, Jay.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.850
Woo-hoo!
Two days of sanding,

00:24.894 --> 00:26.635
three coats of paint,
but the smiles

00:26.678 --> 00:28.854
you claim to see on
your invisible friends' faces

00:28.898 --> 00:30.900
make it all worthwhile.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.511
Hey, should we hang some
- Halloween decorations on it?
- Yes.

00:33.555 --> 00:36.036
Oh, my God, wait.
Halloween? Ghosts!

00:36.079 --> 00:38.647
This is your holiday.
You guys must love Halloween.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.170
Who's gonna tell her?

00:40.214 --> 00:41.998
We hate Halloween.

00:42.042 --> 00:42.999
What'd they say?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.044
They don't like it.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.219
Okay, that feels off brand.

00:45.262 --> 00:46.959
All Hallows Eve mocks us

00:47.003 --> 00:49.092
and belittles
our very existence.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.267
People putting sheets
over their heads

00:50.311 --> 00:51.660
and pretending
to be "ghosts"?

00:51.703 --> 00:53.140
I mean,
what is that?

00:53.183 --> 00:54.880
Plus, we can't do any of the
fun stuff that Livings do.

00:54.924 --> 00:57.100
We can't dress up in costumes,
we can't eat candy...

00:57.144 --> 00:58.623
Can't hook up with
a sexy nurse.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.190
Or a sexy kitten.
Or sexy Bobby Boucher

01:00.234 --> 01:01.365
from <i>Waterboy.</i>

01:01.409 --> 01:02.540
I didn't think
it was possible, either,

01:02.584 --> 01:04.020
but this chick pulled it off.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.891
Also, I died on Halloween.

01:07.719 --> 01:09.852
At a party at the mansion
in 1995.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.114
This is a costume.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.116
I'm actually an accountant
and my name is Mike.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.552
Seriously?

01:14.596 --> 01:16.076
No, I'm 500 years old.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.947
Come on, Sam.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.253
Oh, that was a good one.

01:19.296 --> 01:20.906
Huh. Storyteller.
It's a gift.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.699
Okay, I get that you guys
don't like Halloween.

01:30.742 --> 01:33.354
But all the kids dressed up...
It's so cute.

01:33.397 --> 01:36.096
Don't get us
started on "kids."

01:36.139 --> 01:37.662
Every year
on Halloween,

01:37.706 --> 01:40.404
my beloved Woodstone
Mansion is defiled

01:40.448 --> 01:41.710
by adolescent
hooligans.

01:41.753 --> 01:42.711
They throw eggs,

01:42.754 --> 01:44.234
put toilet paper
in the trees...

01:44.278 --> 01:45.627
Been going on
for decades.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.194
It's sort of a
local tradition,

01:47.237 --> 01:49.109
passed down from delinquent
father to delinquent son.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.458
It's humiliating.

01:50.501 --> 01:51.459
This is our home.

01:51.502 --> 01:52.677
This is where we live.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.723
And we're powerless to stop it.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.117
- What's going on?
- The ghosts say
there's a group of kids

01:57.160 --> 01:58.596
that vandalize the house
each Halloween.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.729
Oh, no, no, no.
Not on my watch, babe.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.165
Guys, don't worry.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.819
Of course-- we have them.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.429
We don't have
to depend on

02:05.473 --> 02:07.344
some useless old lady
to defend the house.

02:07.388 --> 02:10.304
My great-great-granddaughter,
may she rest in peace.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.175
That's right.
This year we have Samantha

02:12.219 --> 02:13.568
and her virile
young husband.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.136
They can do battle against
the wayward youths for us.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.181
Jump out of tree,
and bash their heads!

02:18.225 --> 02:19.313
Oh, my God, no.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.488
Nobody's doing battle
with anybody.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.490
Jay and I will
talk to the kids.

02:22.533 --> 02:23.665
They're probably just
messing with the house

02:23.708 --> 02:25.362
'cause a creepy
old lady lived there.

02:25.406 --> 02:26.842
She was really creepy.
That's true.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.409
Again, my descendant.

02:28.452 --> 02:29.627
Who just passed.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.847
We all were there.
Mm.

02:34.415 --> 02:35.546
<i>Ooh, pre-Halloween pics</i>

02:35.590 --> 02:37.244
are coming in
on the 'Gram.

02:37.287 --> 02:38.767
Yeah, there's gonna be
a lot of Carole Baskins

02:38.810 --> 02:40.682
hooking up with
Baby Yodas this year.

02:40.725 --> 02:43.641
I know it's English,
and yet I gleaned nothing.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.209
Aw, man. Some of our friends
are at a rooftop in Brooklyn.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.559
Aw, somebody's got FOMO.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.170
What is FOMO?

02:50.213 --> 02:51.562
Oh, it's "fear
of missing out."

02:51.606 --> 02:53.260
Like if you're not invited
to a party or something.

02:53.303 --> 02:56.176
Like when Mamie Fish
excluded me from her cotillion

02:56.219 --> 02:57.829
because she knew
I had the more comely ankles.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.353
Okay, I know we're
not in the city anymore.

02:59.396 --> 03:01.485
But think of

03:01.529 --> 03:03.574
This is our first
Halloween as homeowners.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.185
We're getting
trick-or-treaters.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.664
And we're still
the Step Brothers.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.797
Yeah, I guess it's cool.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.842
- Who are the Step Brothers?
It's from a movie.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.496
We dress like
this every year,

03:12.540 --> 03:13.889
because it's cheap,
it's comfortable,

03:13.932 --> 03:15.717
and it doesn't
sexually objectify me.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.588
But that's the whole point
of Halloween.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.547
Our first trick-or-treaters.

03:19.590 --> 03:20.896
Are you ready?

03:23.377 --> 03:24.943
It's go time.

03:27.555 --> 03:28.686
Trick or treat.

03:28.730 --> 03:29.687
Aw.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.559
He's a little
Ghostbuster.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.865
- A little what?
- What is ghostbuster?

03:33.909 --> 03:35.345
Not now.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.607
Oh, sorry, are we too early?

03:36.651 --> 03:39.306
No, no, I was just
trying to remember

03:39.349 --> 03:41.264
when the <i>Ghostbusters</i> movie
came out

03:41.308 --> 03:44.702
and it was not now,
so it must have been before.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.313
Nailed it, sweetie.

03:46.356 --> 03:50.578
Uh, Ghostbuster, would
you like some candy?

03:50.621 --> 03:52.275
Are you seriously not going to
tell us what a ghostbuster is?

03:52.319 --> 03:54.451
- It's another movie.
- Classic Bill Murray.

03:54.495 --> 03:55.757
He plays a scientist

03:55.800 --> 03:56.932
who's trying to sleep
with Sigourney Weaver

03:56.975 --> 03:58.368
and bust ghosts.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.849
Bust ghosts?

04:01.719 --> 04:03.852
You want to bust me?

04:03.895 --> 04:05.897
I bust you!

04:05.941 --> 04:07.290
Okay, thanks for stopping by,
enjoy your Mounds.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.422
Uh, Happy Halloween!

04:09.597 --> 04:11.425
Ghost thing?
Ghost thing.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.469
Cool.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.733
Ooh! We should watch <i>
Ghostbusters</i> tonight.

04:15.777 --> 04:16.908
You guys will
love it, trust me.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.432
Is there a Blockbuster
around here?

04:18.475 --> 04:19.955
We don't have time
for frivolous entertainment.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.435
We must set up sentries.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.914
An attack is nigh.

04:22.958 --> 04:23.915
Okay, take it easy.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.656
We should do shifts
or something.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.702
Some of you stand around,
keeping lookout,

04:27.745 --> 04:29.443
while I watch
a talkie with Trev.

04:29.486 --> 04:30.748
Oh, you know what?
I'll join you.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.750
What? No! You guys are
the worst army ever.

04:32.794 --> 04:33.925
I never saw it.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.449
It came out
the year before I died,

04:35.492 --> 04:37.364
but you know how it is--
between work and family

04:37.407 --> 04:38.756
and getting shot in the neck
with an arrow...

04:38.800 --> 04:40.454
Fine, fine.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.369
But the rest of us
will keep watch

04:42.412 --> 04:43.761
and alert the Livings

04:43.805 --> 04:45.763
so they may confront
- our vandals.
- Mm.

04:45.807 --> 04:49.332
Then bash them on the heads!

04:49.376 --> 04:51.378
Any chance you
change your mind on that?

04:51.421 --> 04:52.596
No?

04:52.640 --> 04:54.294
Okay.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.299
The enemies have arrived.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.518
Jay, Isaac says
the enemies have arrived.

05:01.562 --> 05:02.998
Enemies?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.958
You mean these kids
out here on the bikes?

05:07.002 --> 05:08.569
- Come on!

05:12.747 --> 05:14.444
It's the parents
who are at fault.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.054
Properly raised children
would be at home

05:16.098 --> 05:17.882
or working
in a factory.

05:19.449 --> 05:22.452
That's the evil leader Zack,
his paramour Zoey,

05:22.496 --> 05:24.976
and their very dumb
third wheel Robbie.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.326
Dude.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.457
How do you know so much
about these kids?

05:27.501 --> 05:28.763
Last year,
they hung out

05:28.806 --> 05:29.981
and split something called
a "hard lemonade."

05:30.025 --> 05:31.766
And we listened in
on their conversation.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.550
What's up, bro-hams?

05:33.594 --> 05:35.509
Hey, you got some
sick cykes, huh?

05:35.552 --> 05:37.424
Thank you, sir.

05:37.467 --> 05:38.860
I'm sorry, what? Sir?

05:38.903 --> 05:40.165
Ouch.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.341
Well, we just wanted
to introduce ourselves.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.385
I'm Samantha, this is Jay.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.387
And we're the owners
of this house.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.736
So, listen, like,
whatever happened in the past,

05:45.780 --> 05:46.824
it's water under the bridge.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.740
But let's just agree
that it ends here.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.829
Yeah, you know, we were actually
planning on egging the place,

05:51.873 --> 05:53.701
but after seeing you guys,
and seeing how cool you are,

05:53.744 --> 05:55.572
it just doesn't feel right
anymore.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.879
Hmm. This feels like a trap.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.489
Well, thank you.
- Anyway,

05:59.533 --> 06:01.012
we'll be on our way.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.362
Well, next time,
pop on your helmets.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.406
Cool kids wear lids.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.408
They do!
Keep it a hundo.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.062
They seem really nice.

06:07.105 --> 06:09.760
Very. See, Isaac?
No need for war.

06:11.675 --> 06:12.937
Attack!

06:12.981 --> 06:15.549
Egg war!
Get 'em!

06:15.592 --> 06:17.072
Hey! What?
Whoa! What-- No!

06:17.115 --> 06:19.727
- That's not fair!
- How do you like that, bro-ham?

06:22.730 --> 06:24.601
I hate to say
"I told you so."

06:24.645 --> 06:26.560
Wait, no, it's actually
quite satisfying.

06:26.603 --> 06:27.778
This is just great.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.389
Our friends
are partying on rooftops,

06:29.432 --> 06:30.999
and we're being egged by
the cast of <i>Stranger Things.</i>

06:31.042 --> 06:32.435
We have to do something.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.045
Those kids can't
get away with that.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.656
Do something? It's over.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.875
We've just got to get
cleaned up and move on.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.529
Wait, no. Samantha is right.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.444
There must be accountability.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.141
Without repercussions,
these children will never learn.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.535
The ghosts agree.
The kids need consequences.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.015
Come on, babe.
What do they know?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.712
Well, for one thing,
we were parents.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.105
Well, they were all parents.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.541
I'm definitely not a parent.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.151
I don't know why
I said "definitely."

06:53.195 --> 06:54.805
I mean, I had sex
during my life.

06:54.849 --> 06:57.852
We just have also been around
for such a very long time,

06:57.895 --> 06:59.506
we have observed what works
and what doesn't work

06:59.549 --> 07:01.072
with regard to disciplining
children.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.683
So what do you think
we should do?

07:02.726 --> 07:04.685
I just told you I think
we should let it go.

07:04.728 --> 07:05.729
I was actually asking
the ghosts.

07:05.773 --> 07:08.036
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

07:08.079 --> 07:09.516
They've been around forever.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.734
We should take advantage
of this.

07:10.778 --> 07:13.084
It's like a wise council
of elders.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.696
43 times.
I had sex 43 times.

07:15.739 --> 07:18.176
A number so specific
it'd be impossible to make up.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.787
You know what I would do,
if I were alive

07:19.830 --> 07:21.179
and the telephone

07:21.223 --> 07:22.920
- call their mommies.
Yes.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.488
Zack's last name is Ekenrod
if that helps.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.969
His mother is Meg. She works
at a place called Applebee's

07:28.012 --> 07:29.449
as some sort of wench.

07:29.492 --> 07:31.581
They're saying we should
call Zack's mom.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.888
They want us to narc? Mm-mm.
Snitches get stitches.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.498
You're only gonna
antagonize him.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.065
Or correct his behavior.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.721
Okay, do people think
I'm lying about the sex thing?

07:40.764 --> 07:42.200
'Cause I'm really not lying.

07:42.244 --> 07:43.811
Don't worry.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.160
I know you tell truth.

07:45.203 --> 07:47.902
As ghost I watch you
many times.

07:47.945 --> 07:51.035
Thank you.
Wait, what?

07:51.079 --> 07:52.559
<i>Pause the movie, Trev.</i>

07:52.602 --> 07:54.212
<i>Pause the movie.</i>

07:54.256 --> 07:55.649
Paused. Whew.

07:55.692 --> 07:58.478
What the H-E-double hockey
sticks is this movie?

07:58.521 --> 07:59.740
People rounding up ghosts,

07:59.783 --> 08:01.698
keeping them in some
contraption.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.961
For what? Till when?

08:04.005 --> 08:05.659
I thought Venkman
was a hero.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.704
He's no hero,
he's a war criminal.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.967
Poor Slimer's just trying
to live his afterlife,

08:10.011 --> 08:12.143
eating leftover room service
that no one even wants.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.842
And then they vacuum him up
into this tiny little box?

08:14.885 --> 08:17.148
I don't remember it
being this disturbing.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.020
Well, you were a Living
when you watched it last.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.891
This is a whole new perspective.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.024
Also, why the hell
are they all green?

08:23.067 --> 08:24.634
Were they green in life?

08:24.678 --> 08:27.681
I mean, what died
and made that ghost?

08:29.291 --> 08:31.511
Look, we're not trying to
get anyone in trouble.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.556
But we didn't want to
just let it go.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.166
Tell her to deny him supper.

08:35.210 --> 08:38.605
Tell her to do Blood Eagle;
tear out ribs and lungs.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.607
Zack, apologize to them.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.610
Fine. I'm sorry.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.133
It wasn't nice,

08:45.176 --> 08:46.134
and I won't do it again.

08:46.177 --> 08:47.657
Thank you, Zack.

08:47.701 --> 08:49.006
Apology accepted.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.878
All right, let's go.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.843
- Well, that was subtle.
- It wasn't great.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.671
I told you we were gonna
antagonize

09:01.715 --> 09:02.933
the little psychopath.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.022
Maybe he was just
messing with us.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.546
Blood Eagle get out truth.

09:06.589 --> 09:11.159
Or fake confession.
Either way it's still fun.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.944
Troops, we all saw
the threatening gesture

09:13.988 --> 09:15.990
made by young Zack.

09:16.033 --> 09:20.211
It doesn't take a military
genius, which I am,

09:20.255 --> 09:23.301
to know that we must be
on guard for a new attack.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.868
We must spread out.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.783
Vast territory to defend.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.219
Yes, that is the rub.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.699
But where?

09:29.743 --> 09:32.049
Where will these rapscallions
strike next?

09:32.093 --> 09:34.051
Well, I can tell you
an obvious target.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.662
We're sitting in it.

09:35.705 --> 09:38.012
Sasappis is right.
This recently restored

09:38.055 --> 09:40.710
grand structure, all lit up,
it's begging to be hit.

09:40.754 --> 09:41.929
Yes, that's right.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.321
We must tell Samantha to

09:43.365 --> 09:44.845
turn these lights off
immediately.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.803
This place is a sitting duck.

09:46.847 --> 09:50.198
Thorfinn turn
off lights. Easy.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.808
Very good.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.947
Gadzooks, what have you done?!

09:59.990 --> 10:01.992
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

10:02.036 --> 10:04.691
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.000
Uh-oh.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.654
If anyone has a water power
they're sitting on,

10:11.698 --> 10:13.961
now would be
a good time to use it.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.358
Oh, this isn't good.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.403
They worked forever on this.
I watched Jay sand for hours,

10:21.446 --> 10:24.014
getting sweatier
and sweatier...

10:24.058 --> 10:27.627
Maybe they won't notice.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.717
The Livings are not
going to be happy.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.632
Well, the good news is there's
nothing they can really do.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.330
We're ghosts. We're impervious
to their worldly punishments.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.592
They could take away our TV.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.941
Wait, no.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.290
But there's
a new season of <i>The Bakeoff.</i>

10:39.334 --> 10:42.163
- No! No, no, no, no!
- Our gazebo!

10:42.206 --> 10:43.294
Oh, my God.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.774
What happened?
Did anybody see anything?

10:44.818 --> 10:47.255
Is actually funny story.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.430
It was the kids.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.040
- The kids did it.
I got this.

10:50.084 --> 10:54.697
And that's-that's what happened,
and that's what we all saw.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.743
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

10:56.786 --> 10:57.831
What? What's going on?

10:57.874 --> 10:59.615
They're saying they saw
those kids

10:59.659 --> 11:00.660
burn down the gazebo.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.400
I-I can't believe this.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.663
Oh, my God, that kid
really follows through

11:03.706 --> 11:04.794
on a threat, doesn't he?

11:04.838 --> 11:06.491
The tiny fiends approached

11:06.535 --> 11:08.145
with malice in their eyes,

11:08.189 --> 11:10.278
their torches held aloft.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.671
They had torches?

11:11.714 --> 11:12.802
Those tiny wooden torches.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.499
Matches, I believe
you call them.

11:14.543 --> 11:15.675
Yes, that's the word
I was looking for.

11:15.718 --> 11:16.806
Damn my female brain.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.634
This doesn't make any sense.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.505
I mean, they egg, they TP,
but arson?

11:20.549 --> 11:23.508
- This is a major escalation.
And yet it happened.

11:23.552 --> 11:26.337
As sad a comment on today's
youth though that may be.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.905
We're gonna have to
call the cops.

11:28.949 --> 11:32.300
This is officially
the worst Halloween ever.

11:32.343 --> 11:33.562
Fine! I get it.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.738
I took you away from
all those fun parties,

11:35.782 --> 11:37.740
and then I called
that kid's mommy,

11:37.784 --> 11:39.524
and now we have no gazebo,
and it's all my fault.

11:39.568 --> 11:40.569
I'm sorry, Jay.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.705
Man, I can't believe kids are

11:45.748 --> 11:47.315
capable of this sort of thing.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.273
Didn't kids murder you?

11:49.317 --> 11:52.320
That was an accident,
I-I'm pretty sure.

11:52.363 --> 11:55.192
<i>Well, we talked
to the kids, and...</i>

11:55.236 --> 11:56.367
they denied everything.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.239
The kid made a weird
throat slash gesture,

11:58.282 --> 11:59.544
and an hour later,
the gazebo burned down.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.198
Isn't that pretty damning?

12:01.242 --> 12:02.634
She'd have made
a great lawyer

12:02.678 --> 12:04.724
had she not gone into journalism
or been born a woman.

12:04.767 --> 12:05.942
Okay, look,

12:05.986 --> 12:07.465
this is a small town.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.946
We know these kids,
and frankly, they're bad news.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.688
Nothing like arson before,
but maybe they just snapped.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.691
They did say that you
called their mommies.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.301
Listen, what's gonna happen
to these kids?

12:17.345 --> 12:18.738
Eh, we're looking at fines,

12:18.781 --> 12:20.130
maybe community service.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.567
They'll definitely kick Zack
off the basketball team.

12:22.611 --> 12:25.396
Yeah, what these kids
really burned down tonight

12:25.440 --> 12:26.833
was any hope
for a bright future.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.486
Oh, boy.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.402
- Keep it together, man.
- Have you noticed any other

12:31.446 --> 12:35.232
suspicious activity
around the house?

12:35.276 --> 12:36.886
Mm... no.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.801
Well, would you mind
showing us to the, uh,

12:38.845 --> 12:41.412
uh, uh... the gazebo?

12:41.456 --> 12:43.240
Sure.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.981
You couldn't remember
"gazebo"?

12:45.025 --> 12:46.722
Well, all's well that ends well.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.637
And, oh, God,
I believe it's Sunday.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.508
Pete, I think it's time
for Food Club.

12:50.552 --> 12:51.771
- Oh, where did we
leave off last week?

12:51.814 --> 12:52.946
Thor was talking about cod.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.817
Oh, yes, you're right.
Absolutely.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.689
It was quite a cliffhanger,
- if I recall.
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!

12:57.733 --> 12:59.822
Not so fast.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.607
Something doesn't
smell right here.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.696
I think everything smells
perfectly fine.

13:04.740 --> 13:08.526
Thorfinn, sounds like those kids
are in a lot of trouble.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.963
Do you think they deserve it?

13:10.006 --> 13:11.791
Well, I mean...

13:11.834 --> 13:13.923
Of course he thinks
- they deserve it.
- I didn't ask you.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.578
Spill it, iceberg.
What are you sitting on?

13:16.621 --> 13:21.409
Okay! Kids didn't do it.
I did.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.280
- What?
- Good God, man,

13:23.324 --> 13:25.674
- that's all it took?
- How did you know?

13:25.717 --> 13:27.632
You date a two-timing
bootlegger for five years,

13:27.676 --> 13:30.374
you learn to tell
- when someone's lying.
- It was an accident.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.854
Also, Isaac lie.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.900
Hetty and Sass went along.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.466
Sorry.

13:35.510 --> 13:36.859
Law of the sea.

13:36.903 --> 13:40.036
The ship goes down,
we all perish.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.821
Well, we have to tell Sam.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.039
Look, maybe these kids
didn't commit

13:43.083 --> 13:44.867
this particular offense,

13:44.911 --> 13:46.086
but they have been
terrorizing

13:46.129 --> 13:47.827
Woodstone Mansion
for years.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.959
We can't just frame them.

13:50.003 --> 13:53.093
This goes against
- everything I stand for.
- Oh, really, Pete?

13:53.136 --> 13:55.878
Because from where
I'm sitting, I see a man

13:55.922 --> 13:57.749
who for the past 40 years
has blathered on

13:57.793 --> 14:00.274
about his "troop,"
and things like loyalty.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.232
I mean, you literally have
a loyalty badge.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.147
So?

14:04.191 --> 14:05.192
So we're your troop now.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.063
Your loyalty lies with us.

14:07.107 --> 14:10.850
So what's it gonna be, Pete,
the ghosts or the Livings, hmm?

14:11.894 --> 14:13.940
Trevor, back us up.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.075
I stand with Pete.

14:19.119 --> 14:21.686
Wait, what? But Pete's
on the side of good.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.079
I mean, the other side.

14:23.123 --> 14:26.778
We spend our days complaining
about how Halloween

14:26.822 --> 14:28.693
makes us out to be evil,

14:28.737 --> 14:32.654
and movies paint us
to be the villains.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.656
But if we let some kids
take the fall

14:34.699 --> 14:36.136
for something that we did,

14:36.179 --> 14:40.053
then aren't we exactly
what they say we are?

14:40.096 --> 14:42.925
And don't we deserve
to be busted?

14:42.969 --> 14:45.101
Oh, amen.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.842
Really?

14:46.886 --> 14:47.974
He's the one doing
the right thing?

14:48.017 --> 14:49.845
I really do feel bad now.

14:51.847 --> 14:53.675
Are you slow-clapping
your own speech?

14:53.718 --> 14:55.285
You're damn right I am.
They haven't seen an '80s movie,

14:55.329 --> 14:57.722
and you didn't start it,
so I have to.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.825
That's weird.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.351
There's some charred wood
over there.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.396
Is that part of the gazebo?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.659
Why would they drag it
over there?

15:21.703 --> 15:23.661
Oh, no, no, no.
That's our canoe.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.315
Yeah, yeah, we dragged it
up from the lake.

15:25.359 --> 15:28.057
Hold up. You're the folks
that burned down the canoe

15:28.101 --> 15:29.058
a few weeks ago.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.364
I didn't get
a good look at you.

15:30.407 --> 15:31.800
Well, here we are.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.019
And now you're claiming
that some kids

15:33.062 --> 15:34.411
burned down your gazebo?

15:34.455 --> 15:35.891
Okay, it doesn't
look great.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.762
- Yeah, but we're not arsonists.
- No.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.851
Although if we were arsonists,
we would definitely

15:39.895 --> 15:41.244
deny being arsonists.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.029
'Cause that would--
I'm not gonna talk anymore.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.987
Why would we burn down
our own gazebo?

15:45.031 --> 15:46.902
Why would you burn down
your own canoe?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.860
- We had zero to do with this.
- Zero.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.993
- This was 100% those kids.
- It was the kids.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.168
And frankly, we're
a little offended

15:52.212 --> 15:53.213
that you would even
accuse us

15:53.256 --> 15:54.301
of something so heinous.

15:54.344 --> 15:55.824
A quick word if I may, Samantha.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.957
It wasn't the kids.
We lied.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.175
We burned down the gazebo.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.351
So, okay, carry on.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.355
Although actually, it may
not have been the kids.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.878
What?

16:06.922 --> 16:08.706
Yeah, it's sort of
coming to me now.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.447
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.101
Ma'am, what's going on?

16:12.145 --> 16:15.148
I had a cigarette earlier.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.933
I recently started
smoking again.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.066
And I thought
I put it out,

16:20.109 --> 16:21.371
but now that I'm
thinking about it again,

16:21.415 --> 16:23.199
maybe it wasn't completely out.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.158
And you just
remembered this now?

16:25.201 --> 16:26.724
I didn't want Jay
to find out.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.988
And, uh, then the lies just
sort of started piling up

16:29.031 --> 16:32.034
on top of each other,
and then he called you guys.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.557
Okay, Jim, I think
we should wrap this up.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.342
Ma'am, if you have
any other problems,

16:35.385 --> 16:36.386
please lose our number.

16:36.430 --> 16:39.520
That's more than fair.
Thank you.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.043
- Sorry.
- You're smoking?

16:41.087 --> 16:42.175
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

16:42.218 --> 16:43.654
Jay, the ghosts
burned down the gazebo.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.439
What do you mean the ghosts
burned it down? How?

16:45.482 --> 16:48.050
I don't know, but
they are in big trouble.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.009
W-Well, what, can they shoot
lasers out of their eyes?

16:50.052 --> 16:52.011
That would be so cool.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.056
I mean terrifying,
but so cool!

16:57.103 --> 16:58.843
Samantha, we want you
to know that

16:58.887 --> 17:00.932
- we just feel terrible.
Yes.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.325
And we would like to take
this opportunity

17:02.369 --> 17:03.935
to formally apologize

17:03.979 --> 17:05.502
for this evening's, um,

17:05.546 --> 17:08.027
you know what, let's call them
missteps, shall we?

17:08.070 --> 17:10.029
Because I think we all learned
a very valuable les...

17:10.072 --> 17:11.508
Shut it, Isaac.
Ooh. Yep.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.206
Tonight was unacceptable.

17:13.249 --> 17:16.122
You guys destroyed our property,
then lied about it,

17:16.165 --> 17:18.080
then tried to get
children arrested.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.864
You're no wise council
of elders.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.344
You know what they are?

17:21.388 --> 17:22.867
They're the children
in this scenario.

17:22.911 --> 17:23.955
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.045
- Nuh-uh!
- It was Thor.
He started it.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.524
Just so you know,

17:27.568 --> 17:28.917
not all of us were to blame.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.092
I gave a big speech about
doing the right thing.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.051
- It was very moving.
- Mm-hmm.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.269
Someone started a slow-clap.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.401
I don't want to hear it.

17:34.444 --> 17:35.880
You know what children need

17:35.924 --> 17:37.404
when they do something
wrong, babe?

17:37.447 --> 17:40.015
You give 'em consequences.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.104
That's true, Jay.
I like that.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.585
Small man using our
own words against us.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.021
Not loving where this is headed.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.154
No TV, one week.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.633
But <i>The Bakeoff!</i>

17:49.677 --> 17:50.591
- Oh, no!
- All of us?!

17:50.634 --> 17:52.506
- It's football season.
- Come on!

17:52.549 --> 17:54.421
You guys did this. Come on!

17:57.424 --> 18:00.122
What's the latest?

18:00.166 --> 18:01.602
Ooh, they left the rooftop,

18:01.645 --> 18:03.299
and now they're at
a warehouse party

18:03.343 --> 18:04.909
in the Meatpacking District.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.911
Oh, sounds fun.

18:06.955 --> 18:10.219
Yeah. We would've
crushed that.

18:10.263 --> 18:14.484
Well, without storming off
or yelling and in all sincerity,

18:14.528 --> 18:17.096
I'm sorry you had
a lame Halloween.

18:17.139 --> 18:20.099
Yeah, that's the thing,
I didn't.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.839
What do you mean?

18:21.883 --> 18:25.016
Um, our gazebo got
burned down by ghosts

18:25.060 --> 18:28.846
on Halloween, in front
of our haunted house.

18:28.890 --> 18:31.588
We by far had the coolest
Halloween of all our friends.

18:31.632 --> 18:32.937
Really?

18:32.981 --> 18:34.113
Yeah. When we first
moved here from New York,

18:34.156 --> 18:35.940
I thought our lives
were gonna be boring

18:35.984 --> 18:38.291
and slow, but after tonight,

18:38.334 --> 18:42.121
turns out they're gonna
be anything but.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.384
You're okay stuck out here
alone with me?

18:44.427 --> 18:47.387
Hell yeah.
You're all I need.

18:49.258 --> 18:51.260
You're my stepbrother.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.523
No, you're my stepbrother.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.438
<i>Well, this is just disturbing.</i>

18:55.482 --> 18:56.483
<i>Didn't you marry your cousin?</i>

19:02.880 --> 19:05.579
So, how are the ghosts
taking their punishment?

19:05.622 --> 19:07.276
They're not loving it.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.496
Yeah, I wasn't stoked
on no TV either,

19:09.539 --> 19:11.585
but it's kind of peaceful.

19:11.628 --> 19:12.934
- This is so unfair!
- Oh, come on!

19:12.977 --> 19:14.240
We did nothing wrong!

19:14.283 --> 19:15.589
I think they've learned
their lesson.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.199
Mm-mm, stay strong.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.201
Maybe we just put on
something educational.
