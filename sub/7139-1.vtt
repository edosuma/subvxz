00:40.280 --> 00:42.200
[applause]

01:00.240 --> 01:02.960
- Aloha.
- [all] Aloha.

01:03.040 --> 01:08.200
Today the Galactic Council assembles
to honor Lilo and Stitch,

01:08.280 --> 01:13.920
who have successfully captured all 625
of Jumba's genetic experiments,

01:14.000 --> 01:15.840
turned them from bad to good,

01:15.920 --> 01:18.120
and found each a place
where it can belong.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.080
[applause]

01:22.040 --> 01:24.040
To recognize the completion
of their task,

01:24.160 --> 01:27.920
the Galactic Council has elected
to bestow the following rewards...

01:28.000 --> 01:31.840
[gasps] You hear that, Jumba?
We're gonna get prizes.

01:41.040 --> 01:46.520
Dr. Jumba Jookiba, we hereby return
the confiscated key to your laboratory.

01:46.600 --> 01:51.600
Hah! With old lab back,
evil possibilities are infinite!

01:51.680 --> 01:54.200
Agent Wendy Pleakley...

01:54.120 --> 01:56.440
[snores]

01:56.520 --> 02:01.040
...we hereby offer you the chair
of Earth Studies at the GACC.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.160
Ohh.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.640
Galactic Alliance Community College?

02:05.720 --> 02:07.080
Yes!

02:07.160 --> 02:11.480
As for Stitch,
you are hereby offered a commission

02:11.560 --> 02:13.400
as captain of the Galactic Armada

02:13.480 --> 02:18.400
and commander of its
new flagship the BRB-9000.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Ooh. BRB.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.040
What's BRB stand for?

02:25.160 --> 02:29.440
Big Red Battleship!
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

02:29.520 --> 02:34.440
Finally, Lilo Pelekai, you shall
become our first Earth ambassador

02:34.520 --> 02:38.440
and return to Kauai
to be the experiments' sole caretaker.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.440
[applause]

02:43.120 --> 02:47.720
You mean Jumba and Pleakley
and Stitch aren't coming home?

02:54.320 --> 02:57.960
Stitch wants to come back to Kauai.
Right, Stitch?

02:58.080 --> 03:00.880
Oh, uh, Kauai.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.840
Yeah.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.120
Maybe everybody wants to go back?

03:06.200 --> 03:09.760
- Right. Of course.
- What?

03:09.840 --> 03:12.200
Don't you have something to say?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.840
Oh, yeah, right. l'm wishing
to go back to stinky water planet

03:17.920 --> 03:20.440
and share bunk bed
with bossy one-eyed noodle.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.800
ls this your final decision?

03:22.880 --> 03:24.800
[all] Um...

03:31.120 --> 03:32.120
- Eeh.
- Absolutely.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.480
l suppose. Or maybe...

03:34.560 --> 03:36.040
Then so be it.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.960
[electricity crackles]

04:12.040 --> 04:13.960
# Aloha

04:16.079 --> 04:18.120
# Ohana

04:41.560 --> 04:44.440
[foghorn bellows]

05:01.400 --> 05:04.000
[Lilo] Now that we're done
catching experiments,

05:04.080 --> 05:06.520
we can do whatever we want.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.640
l want to finish my logbook.

05:08.760 --> 05:13.200
lt's got a picture of every experiment,
in the one place they belong.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.200
What do you want to do, Stitch?

05:16.800 --> 05:20.760
Hmm... [hums]

05:20.840 --> 05:22.760
- [grunts]
- [pipe creaks]

05:22.840 --> 05:24.880
And, uh... Huh?

05:24.960 --> 05:27.400
- [rustling]
- [Stitch muttering]

05:28.360 --> 05:30.200
Ee-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:30.280 --> 05:34.120
[imitates jets roaring]

05:34.200 --> 05:36.280
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:36.360 --> 05:38.640
[gibberish]

05:40.920 --> 05:42.840
Scale model of Big Red Battleship.

lmpressive.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.200
[microwave beeps]

05:47.280 --> 05:49.160
Where are you taking the microwave?

05:49.240 --> 05:53.560
Hah! Without evil genius lab,
Jumba must energize genetic experiments

05:53.640 --> 05:55.480
with primitive Earth popcorn maker.

05:55.560 --> 05:59.320
You know, the microwave oven
was invented by Dr. Percy Spencer.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.240
Ah, who cares?

06:01.320 --> 06:05.560
lf you were a student at GACC you'd care
'cause it would be on the final exam.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.880
And what do we call this, class?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.240
Breakfast?

06:11.320 --> 06:15.640
Specifically, grain-based flakes
immersed in bovine gland extract.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.640
Eww!

06:18.640 --> 06:20.720
l'm off to work. Oh, Pleakley.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.360
l need you to fix Lilo's skirt
for hula class.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.560
Only if you answer
this extra credit question correctly.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.120
Where did the native Hawaiian
hula dance originate?

06:30.200 --> 06:33.680
- Uh, Hawaii?
- Very good, Nani!

06:33.760 --> 06:37.520
lf you were attending GACC,
l'd move you to the head of the class.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.400
- [imitates jets roaring]
- [crash]

06:42.440 --> 06:44.480
[turbine backfires]

06:51.000 --> 06:52.880
[Gantu] Blitznak!

06:52.960 --> 06:57.280
Without the reserve engines,
this ship is stupid and useless.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.000
- Just like you.
- [sighs] Who am l kidding?

07:00.040 --> 07:01.920
You're right.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.720
l couldn't hold on to
a single one of those experiments.

07:04.760 --> 07:08.440
You still got me,
your faithful sandwich-making pal.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.560
Yes. l noticed the little Earth girl
never captured you.

07:12.680 --> 07:17.240
l guessed the one place l belonged
was with my blubber-butt buddy Gantu.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.960
Maybe that was
my problem all along.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.880
What? Your blubber butt? [chuckles]

07:24.560 --> 07:26.480
Gantu?

07:33.120 --> 07:36.360
So, we're taking
the old two-man shuttle, huh? Heh-heh.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.280
Hey, you want l should fix
a picnic lunch for the trip?

07:39.360 --> 07:41.520
There's only room for two
on the two-man shuttle,

07:41.600 --> 07:44.320
me and Dr. Hamsterviel.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.920
- l'm breaking him out of prison.
- What?

07:47.040 --> 07:48.880
This is my last chance
to redeem myself.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.400
lf l succeed, my future is secured.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.560
What about my future?
How am l supposed to pay the bills?

07:54.640 --> 07:57.280
Why not make sandwiches?
lt's all that you're good at.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.960
- Maybe l will!
- Fine.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.920
You're gonna miss my egg salad!

08:02.000 --> 08:05.240
Not enough mayonnaise
and too much dill weed.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.800
What did you call me?

08:18.200 --> 08:20.400
- [generator starts]
- [beep]

08:20.520 --> 08:22.600
- [crackling]
- [beeps]

08:22.680 --> 08:25.880
Aagh! Primitive Earth science.

08:31.320 --> 08:35.799
Jumba... what was your old lab like?

08:35.880 --> 08:39.600
Ah ha ha ha!
Galaxy Defense lndustries.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.799
State-of-art genetic accelerator.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.080
Endless uburnium energy supply.

08:44.159 --> 08:47.360
Everything little boy Jumba
ever dreamed of having

08:47.440 --> 08:50.360
in evil genius laboratory! [laughs]

08:53.360 --> 08:55.960
Hah...
Um, but popcorn power is good too.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.920
[beeps]

09:02.880 --> 09:06.160
[Pleakley] Welcome, students,
to Earthiana 1 01 .

09:06.240 --> 09:08.080
Quiet, class. Quiet!

09:08.160 --> 09:10.040
Plooka, spit out that gum!

09:10.120 --> 09:12.040
Lenlu, stop playing with your antenna.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.960
- Pleakley.
- Aah! Oh, Lilo!

09:14.000 --> 09:15.840
Don't pay any attention to me.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.520
l wasn't pretending to be
a professor of Earth Studies,

09:18.600 --> 09:22.400
just like l dreamed of
since before l could walk on three legs.

09:22.520 --> 09:26.480
Not at all! l was just, uh,
uh... brushing my tongues!

09:34.480 --> 09:36.520
BRB.

09:58.200 --> 10:02.600
Scrump, have l ever told you the story
of the Lonely Rooster?

10:04.600 --> 10:07.400
Once there was a rooster named Pancake.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.480
He was lonely.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.040
So he went to the beach
to make friends.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.360
He made friends
with a shell named Paula

10:14.440 --> 10:17.000
and an empty can of soda named Jimmy

10:17.080 --> 10:20.560
and a piece of a broken surfboard
named Steve.

10:20.640 --> 10:24.400
They were good friends
and had fun playing together.

10:24.480 --> 10:28.080
But then one day a big wave
splashed over the whole beach

10:28.200 --> 10:31.280
and washed Paula and Jimmy
and Steve away.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.720
[wave crashes]

10:33.800 --> 10:36.520
Pancake was sad
that his friends were gone.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.040
But Pancake was never lonely again,

10:39.120 --> 10:42.640
because he could always remember them.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.640
The end.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.400
Lilo, are you OK?

10:51.480 --> 10:57.040
Scrump and l are getting used to
the way things used to be.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
So, you're letting them go.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.000
They'll say they want to stay,

11:02.120 --> 11:05.880
but it's just because
they don't want me to be sad.

11:05.960 --> 11:09.080
They'll be OK without me, right?

11:09.160 --> 11:11.000
Oh, Lilo.

11:11.040 --> 11:14.360
You're showing so much aloha spirit
letting them go.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.720
And the aloha you give
will always come back to you.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.640
lt's like a circle.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.560
Aloha means hello,
but it also means goodbye.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.040
lt's hard to say goodbye.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.120
l know, baby.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.960
Goodbye, laundry!
Goodbye, dirty dishes!

11:34.040 --> 11:37.120
Goodbye, dust bunnies.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!

11:37.200 --> 11:40.480
Nani says that letting you go
shows aloha spirit,

11:40.560 --> 11:43.760
and that the aloha you give
will always come back to you.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.880
Eh, interesting theory
but scientifically impossible.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.200
l'm estimating 23 percent aloha

11:49.280 --> 11:51.560
- is lost in giving process.
- [beakers break]

11:51.640 --> 11:55.640
You know, aloha is one of those
Earth concepts l never did understand.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.600
Come, Pleakley. Oof!

11:57.680 --> 11:59.520
What is in here, bricks?

11:59.600 --> 12:01.440
Concrete, adobe, terra cotta...

12:01.560 --> 12:03.480
You name the brick, it's in there.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.400
My students are sure
to find them fascinating.

12:32.520 --> 12:36.800
Jumba, you belong back in
your real evil genius laboratory.

12:36.680 --> 12:40.040
But if you're ever missing Kauai,
you can play this.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.360
lt's my favorite Elvis record.

12:43.440 --> 12:47.120
Pleakley, you belong
at Galactic Alliance Community College

12:47.200 --> 12:49.880
teaching Earth stuff to aliens.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.800
That's why l'm giving you this rock.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.480
Here it's just a dumb old paperweight,

12:54.560 --> 12:58.760
but out there it'll be a dumb old
paperweight from another planet.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.400
l'll keep it with me always.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.360
And, Stitch, you belong...

13:07.920 --> 13:10.360
l'll miss you too.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.520
But you belong out in space,

13:16.560 --> 13:19.760
catching bad guys
with the Big Red Battleship.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.720
This is a very special necklace.

13:22.800 --> 13:27.040
l kept it hidden in a sock
for three years.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.960
lt's Ku Tiki, the god of strength.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.160
Promise to never take it off?

13:34.200 --> 13:37.520
- Promise.
- You're number 626.

13:37.640 --> 13:42.360
- Name: Stitch.
- [camera clicks]

13:54.920 --> 13:56.360
Aloha.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.160
Aloha.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.760
[alarm blares]

14:40.320 --> 14:44.080
Don't worry, Dr. Hamsterviel,
your escape will soon be complete.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.000
What do you mean ''complete''?

14:46.080 --> 14:48.080
You haven't even broken me
out of my cell!

14:48.200 --> 14:50.040
Then who is this?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.960
That's the warden's gerbil,
you nearsighted fish stick!

14:53.000 --> 14:55.080
[laughter]

14:55.160 --> 14:57.000
Hmm. He looks just like you.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.400
[P.A.] Security command,
release portal 7.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.360
Run! Run!

15:06.440 --> 15:08.760
And put down that gerbil!

15:18.000 --> 15:20.360
l brought you a little surprise.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.640
- What is it?
- An Earth souvenir.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.000
They call it an aloha lei.
lt symbolizes...

15:25.080 --> 15:27.080
Excellent! l'm starving!

15:27.160 --> 15:29.000
Wait! Wait!
You're not supposed to...

15:29.080 --> 15:31.240
[burps]

15:31.320 --> 15:33.000
Never mind.

15:54.800 --> 15:58.760
- [clears throat] Aloha.
- Captain Stitch.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.040
The Council has received...

16:02.000 --> 16:04.440
You have coconut cake
on your uniform.

16:04.520 --> 16:08.800
Oh. Sorry. [slurps]

16:08.680 --> 16:11.040
The Council has received
a security alert.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.200
With the aid
of the former Captain Gantu,

16:13.280 --> 16:17.000
Dr. Jacques von Hamsterviel
has escaped from prison.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.480
- [gibberish]
- This is your first mission

16:19.600 --> 16:21.920
as captain of the Galactic Armada.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.880
Seek out and capture Dr. Hamsterviel.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.800
lt will also be the maiden voyage of...

16:30.040 --> 16:34.440
- Oh!
- ...the BRB-9000.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.480
- [man] BRB fueling complete.
- [woman] Hatchway secure.

16:37.560 --> 16:39.400
[man] Captain has arrived in the bay.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.640
Oh! Big Red...

16:41.680 --> 16:44.400
[play march]

16:44.480 --> 16:46.760
Whoo-hoo! Aah!

16:46.840 --> 16:48.240
[cymbal crash]

16:54.720 --> 16:57.600
He, uh,
went in through the air manifold.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.160
- [door beeps]
- Captain on the...

17:00.240 --> 17:02.800
- [Stitch laughs]
- ...ceiling?

17:02.880 --> 17:04.800
Big Red, Big Red, Big Red!

17:06.960 --> 17:08.800
Huh?

17:08.839 --> 17:10.839
[seat motor whirring]

17:13.119 --> 17:15.040

Anything l can get for you,
Professor Pleakley?

18:01.040 --> 18:05.760
Why, yes. You could give me
a great big pinch to wake me up!

18:05.640 --> 18:08.000

18:08.080 --> 18:10.760

carpool van, and...

18:16.320 --> 18:19.520
galaxy-wide fame
as the greatest Earth expert ever!

18:19.600 --> 18:23.200
[gasp] ls that a real Earth rock?

18:23.280 --> 18:25.560
Why, yes. Yes, it is.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.640
You've actually been to Earth?

18:27.760 --> 18:29.600
You must tell me everything.

18:29.680 --> 18:33.480
Of course. But you will have to wait
for my first lecture,

18:33.560 --> 18:36.320

A One-Eyed View.''

18:36.400 --> 18:39.320

18:39.200 --> 18:41.240

18:41.120 --> 18:44.640
Oh. Well, then,
in my first class you can always...

18:44.720 --> 18:46.560
And you don't have classes either.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.600
You're a supervising professor.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.520
That's why you get
all this great stuff:

18:50.600 --> 18:54.600
the office, the encyclopedias,
your own walk-in closet and wardrobe.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.640
Oh, right.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.520
Could we take a look at that,
um, new wardrobe?

19:01.560 --> 19:05.320
Ah! Jumba's evil scientist laboratory.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.080

19:07.960 --> 19:11.480

of evil experimentation,

19:11.520 --> 19:14.120
ending with disgrace,
arrest and imprisonment,

19:14.200 --> 19:16.680
but still wonderful memories.

19:16.760 --> 19:20.320
So much new evil to be done.
Heh-heh-heh!

19:20.400 --> 19:23.680
Where to begin?
Antiaircraft lollipops?

19:23.760 --> 19:26.200
Oh! Permanently stinky bedroom slippers?

19:26.280 --> 19:28.720
Or perhaps device
to stop evil genius talking to self.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.160
Heh-heh-heh-heh!
Eh, silly Jumba.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.840

but you can help me instead.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.600
We just check to make sure
that all Stitch's cousins

19:40.680 --> 19:44.680

20:52.080 --> 20:53.800

20:53.880 --> 20:56.400
He's an outer space pilot
in a Big Red Battleship

Once a weirdo, always a weirdo.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.520
- l didn't know you had a dad.
- Quiet, Yuki.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.280
ln fact, l bet that's why
your dog ran away,

21:21.360 --> 21:24.280

he's never coming back.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.120

our first experiment?

25:43.440 --> 25:45.560
You remember Shrink?

25:45.640 --> 25:51.240
25 years of partnership,
and you did nothing but cheat Jumba,

25:51.320 --> 25:53.800
embarrass Jumba, steal from Jumba,

25:53.720 --> 25:56.760
and finally fink on Jumba
to Galactic Federation.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.640
For you, l wouldn't create

26:00.760 --> 26:03.960
Very well, then.
You leave me no choice

26:04.040 --> 26:08.080

to make a new experiment by force!

26:09.240 --> 26:12.240
By force! By force!
That was your cue!

26:12.320 --> 26:14.240
Sorry.

26:17.040 --> 26:21.960
Now, Jumba, l will explain this
only once and oh, so patiently.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.920
l want to order a new version of 626.

26:25.040 --> 26:29.320
Make him with extra destructive
capabilities but easy on the fluffy.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.280

26:31.360 --> 26:33.200

and make him to go!

32:13.560 --> 32:15.480
[Pleakley] l just wanted to make up.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.800
Next time send flowers.

32:17.920 --> 32:22.120
Now that l have proven Leroy
to be an invincible fighting machine...

32:22.200 --> 32:24.640
Leroy? [laughs]

32:24.720 --> 32:29.720
...l shall proceed with the next phase
of my oh-so-clever plan,

32:29.800 --> 32:33.480
creating an army of Leroy clones!

32:33.560 --> 32:35.680
[machine hums]

[cackles]

32:42.320 --> 32:44.240
[bell counter ticking]

32:57.440 --> 33:02.160
And now, to dispose of you
three meddling meddlers.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.080
[grunting]

33:04.120 --> 33:06.560
l have cleverly
programmed this vehicle

33:06.640 --> 33:11.440
with destination
coordinates 1 2-21 -9-7-9.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.360
The black hole!

33:13.440 --> 33:15.160
We can't fly into a black hole!

33:15.240 --> 33:17.680
l've gotta have the van
back to the college by 6:00.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.760
Well, you're going to be late
by about...

33:21.880 --> 33:24.160
...forever! [echoes]

33:28.240 --> 33:30.960

33:31.040 --> 33:34.320

33:40.520 --> 33:42.400
Captain setting destination coordinates.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.320
Zero parsec?

33:44.360 --> 33:49.000
Captain Stitch, our orders are
to return the prisoner to Asteroid K-37.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.920
Why are we setting a course for Turo?

33:50.960 --> 33:53.400
[snarls, speaks gibberish]

33:53.520 --> 33:56.320
[gasps] You're not the captain!

33:56.400 --> 33:59.800
He is now! [cackles]

34:01.240 --> 34:03.280
[snarls]

34:05.520 --> 34:07.640
[line ringing]

34:10.600 --> 34:12.480
[man] Hello, this is Cobra Bubbles.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.480
Cobra, l want to call Stitch.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.440
I'm unable to come
to the phone right now.

34:16.520 --> 34:19.320
My current location: classified.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.199
Estimated return time: classified.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.639
Have a nice day.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.600
[sighs]

34:31.800 --> 34:33.679
[Nani] Does Scrump want some breakfast?

34:33.800 --> 34:36.760
lt's her favorite, cold pizza.

34:38.679 --> 34:41.199
She's not hungry.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.440
She's worried about Stitch.

34:43.520 --> 34:46.159
Aww, Stitch can take care of himself.

34:46.199 --> 34:48.080
He's indestructible, remember?

34:48.120 --> 34:52.960
l told Scrump that,
but she gets feelings sometimes.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.960
She thinks something's wrong.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.840
so l've been trying to
get in touch with Stitch.

34:57.960 --> 34:59.800
Oh, 'cause you're gonna need

34:59.880 --> 35:03.640
one of those intergalactic communicator
thingies if you want to contact him.

35:03.720 --> 35:06.280
l know!
But Jumba and Pleakley's ship is gone,

35:06.360 --> 35:08.600
and Pleakley took his space cell phone.

35:08.680 --> 35:12.440
Who else? Out of my way!

35:12.520 --> 35:15.040
- l need peanut butter!
- For breakfast?

35:19.840 --> 35:21.920
Hello?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.880
Hmmph, Gantu schmantu.
Who needs him?

35:25.960 --> 35:27.840
Nothing but a pain
in the patookie anyhow.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.840
Didn't even like my egg salad.

35:29.880 --> 35:32.120
''More mayonnaise, less dill weed.''

35:32.200 --> 35:35.600
- Uh, hello?
- Sorry, we're not open.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.800
- Open?
- l'm turning this dump

35:37.880 --> 35:41.960
into the best spaceship-shaped
sandwich shop on the island.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.320
- Where's Gantu?
- He left.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.360
But l'm naming
a sandwich after him,

35:47.440 --> 35:50.000
the open-faced
double decker blubber butt.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.120
l won't ask what's in it.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.360
l brought you something.

35:58.880 --> 36:01.000
Peanut butter and jelly? [sniffs]

36:01.120 --> 36:04.960
Gee, nobody's ever made me a sandwich.
Heh-heh.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.920
Hey, what do you want?

36:07.000 --> 36:08.880
l need to call Stitch.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.160
Sorry. Videophone's busted,
like everything else in this dump.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.800
- Can you fix it?
- Why should l?

36:15.880 --> 36:18.320
Gantu's the only one who'd call,
and l ain't answerin'.

36:18.400 --> 36:22.360
From now on, l'm lookin' out
for old number 625.

36:22.440 --> 36:26.880
625. l never gave you a name, did l?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.400
A name? For me?

36:29.440 --> 36:32.240
Let's see. How about Patty?

36:32.320 --> 36:34.840
Short for patty melt.

36:34.920 --> 36:39.080
Or... Monte? Like a Monte Cristo?

36:39.160 --> 36:42.080
Or Pita Pita Sandwich Eata. [chuckles]

36:41.960 --> 36:44.960
[sarcastic chuckle] l don't think so.

36:45.040 --> 36:47.160
l know! Reuben.

36:47.240 --> 36:51.160
Huh. The classic corned beef
and sauerkraut on rye.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.560
Reuben. Ooh, l like that.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.760
So, uh, does this give me
official ''cousin'' status?

36:56.840 --> 37:00.120
You know, full ohana rights?
All that aloha stuff?

37:00.160 --> 37:03.440
Depends. You have to give aloha
to get some back.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.440
So, you're gonna help me
fix the videophone?

37:06.560 --> 37:08.400
Sure. Why not?

37:08.480 --> 37:11.680
lt's Lilo, right?

37:23.720 --> 37:26.320
Uh, you sure
that's gonna work?

37:26.360 --> 37:30.080
You'd be amazed.
Pickle juice is a great conductor.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.880
[humming]

37:32.920 --> 37:35.720
- You may thank me later.
- l'll thank you now.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.720
Mahalo, Reuben.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.480
Heh. No problem, Lilo.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.600
[snarls]

37:59.640 --> 38:02.560
- [Leroy laughs]

38:05.840 --> 38:07.680
[growls, speaks gibberish]

38:07.760 --> 38:09.840
lt must be the little Earth girl.

38:09.960 --> 38:14.240
Ha-ha! My Leroy will easily
dupe her tiny little brain.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.240
Hide!

38:23.040 --> 38:24.960
Oooh!

38:28.080 --> 38:30.120
Aloha, Stitch.

38:30.200 --> 38:33.040
- Stitch?
- Uh...

38:33.120 --> 38:35.880
- Say ''eeh.''
- Eeh.

38:35.960 --> 38:39.720
- Are you OK?
- No, cuter. Think ''plush toy''!

38:39.800 --> 38:43.400
Oh, yeah, it's me. I'm Fluffy.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.400
That's him, all right.

38:49.680 --> 38:52.920
Wait a minute. My tiki necklace.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.640
He's not wearing it. That's not Stitch!

38:56.720 --> 39:00.800
- Hang up. Hang up!
- OK! Bye-bye!

39:00.880 --> 39:03.120
- Wait!
- [explosion]

39:06.040 --> 39:09.800
Ah. l think that went very well,
don't you?

39:09.880 --> 39:12.280
- Actually, l think...
- l didn't ask what you think!

39:12.360 --> 39:15.480
- Actually, you did. l...
- lt was a rhetorical question!

39:15.400 --> 39:17.800
Don't you know what
a rhetorical question is?

39:17.920 --> 39:21.680
- Yes, sir! l believe it's...
- That was rhetorical too!

39:21.760 --> 39:25.120
[groans] Aah! [sighs]

39:25.200 --> 39:28.880
My genius plan is unfolding perfectly.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.640
Prepare for hyperspace to planet Turo,

39:31.720 --> 39:33.840
where l and my army of Leroys...

39:33.920 --> 39:37.760
- [slurping]
- Quit picking your nose.

39:37.840 --> 39:41.400
...shall take over
the stinky Galactic Alliance!

39:41.280 --> 39:44.280
Sir, l must point out
a weak spot in your plan.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.400
The little Earth girl
has a special talent

39:46.520 --> 39:49.320
for turning evil experiments
from bad to good.

39:49.400 --> 39:53.200
And she controls a force of over 600
of Jumba's genetic creations.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.240
This makes her a credible threat
to your Leroy army.

39:56.320 --> 39:59.280
Very well.
Then the little girl's experiments

39:59.360 --> 40:02.960
must be captured
and taken to a large public arena,

40:03.040 --> 40:05.120
where l shall destroy them all!

40:05.200 --> 40:06.560
[cackling]

40:06.640 --> 40:10.120
This is clearly a job
for my most trusted henchman.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.800
Thank you, sir.
l won't fail you this time.

40:12.880 --> 40:17.440
You have already failed me 625 times.

40:17.600 --> 40:21.880
No, this time l will send
my new trusted henchman,

40:21.960 --> 40:25.520
- Leroy!
- [growls]

40:28.400 --> 40:30.440

40:30.520 --> 40:34.960
Reuben, there's a fake Stitch
driving the Big Red Battleship.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.080
Do you know what that means?

40:36.960 --> 40:38.880
l don't know. lt's lunchtime?

40:38.960 --> 40:43.960
No. Stitch is in trouble, and so is
the Galactic Armada and planet Turo

40:44.000 --> 40:46.560
and maybe the whole galaxy!

40:46.640 --> 40:48.960
lt ain't our problem.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.920
Look, you're number 625.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.880
The closest one to Stitch.

40:53.960 --> 40:58.000
lf you wanted to,
you could have all of his powers.

40:58.040 --> 41:03.080
You just have to stop making sandwiches
and start making something of yourself.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.400
- [sighs]
- l'm gonna fix this ship,

41:05.480 --> 41:08.840

and warn the Grand Councilwoman.

41:08.920 --> 41:11.520
Are you with me?

41:12.480 --> 41:16.400
l said, are you with me?

41:16.280 --> 41:19.560
l'm with you, sister,
but first we gotta put this servo unit

41:19.640 --> 41:21.480
back in the main drive shaft.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.520
You are as strong as Stitch.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.680
Now, we reroute
the ignition conduit...

41:25.800 --> 41:27.520
And you can walk on the ceiling.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.760
[Reuben] Whoa-ohh!

47:30.800 --> 47:32.640
Stitch is in trouble!

47:32.720 --> 47:35.080
He's not in control of...

47:35.120 --> 47:37.360
- Hello.
- Hamsterviel?

47:37.440 --> 47:40.880
- ''Hamsterveal''?
- lt is pronounced Hamsterviel.

47:40.960 --> 47:43.080
Dr. Jacques von Hamsterviel,

47:43.160 --> 47:45.400
king, top ruler of the galaxy.

47:45.520 --> 47:47.360
[cackles]

47:47.440 --> 47:49.360
l'd get down and gloat in your faces,

47:49.480 --> 47:52.680
but l can't get out this chair. Gantu!

47:53.880 --> 47:55.960
Heh-heh! Nice cape.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.160
- We're too late.
- lndeed.

47:58.240 --> 48:03.040
l have taken over the Galactic Alliance
using my army of clones named Leroy.

48:03.120 --> 48:05.720
- Leroy?
- What's wrong with Leroy?

48:05.800 --> 48:07.880
Nothing. l like it.

48:07.960 --> 48:10.000
- See?
- [growls]

48:10.080 --> 48:12.120
You can't run the galaxy.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.920
That's the Grand Councilwoman's job.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.680
She has been demoted.

48:17.800 --> 48:20.640
- Dr. Hamsterviel's office.
- [creature jabbering]

48:20.720 --> 48:22.560
l'm sorry. He's in a meeting.

48:22.640 --> 48:25.120
lt'll never work. Stitch will stop you.

48:25.200 --> 48:27.280
Hmm, Stitch? Sti...

48:27.360 --> 48:29.920
Oh, you mean that weakling 626?

48:30.000 --> 48:33.240
The one l sent tumbling
to his doom in a black hole?

48:33.320 --> 48:36.000
ls that the Stitch to which
you are referring to?

48:36.040 --> 48:39.400
- Black hole?
- Oh, don't worry.

48:39.480 --> 48:41.320
He's got plenty of company.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.800
That idiot scientist
and one-eyed noodley thing.

48:43.880 --> 48:46.280
Jumba and Pleakley?

48:46.360 --> 48:48.440
- What is it?
- Incoming call, sir,

48:48.560 --> 48:51.920
- from a Mr. Leroy.
- Put him through!

48:52.880 --> 48:54.760
What is the progress?

48:54.840 --> 48:57.080
[speaks gibberish]

48:57.160 --> 49:01.600
- Talk normal!
- All experiments captured.

49:01.680 --> 49:03.840
Excellent! l'm on my way.

49:03.920 --> 49:07.280
lt has taken Leroy
a paltry few hours to succeed

49:07.360 --> 49:09.720
while you took three years to fail.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.600
- What is wrong with you?
- Well, l have a bad knee.

49:12.680 --> 49:15.280
No! That was a rhetorical question.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.920
You don't answer it!

49:18.000 --> 49:20.640
Now will you get me down
from this chair.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.640
Uh, was that a rhetorical question?

49:22.720 --> 49:25.880
No! That one was not...
Get me down! Get me down!

49:25.960 --> 49:28.920
[Gantu] What should l do
with the girl and 625?

49:29.040 --> 49:31.640
- Take them to the prison block.
- Yes, sir.

49:31.720 --> 49:35.000
Then pick up your final paycheck
and return your lD.

49:35.080 --> 49:37.920
- What?!
- You heard me. You are fired.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.960
Now that l have Leroy,
you are no longer needed.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.880
But what about my future?

49:42.960 --> 49:45.280
How am l supposed to pay the bills?

49:45.320 --> 49:47.160
Well, why not write your memoirs?

49:47.240 --> 49:49.440

The Idiot Years.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.640
[sighs]

49:54.760 --> 49:59.040
To assure my galactic dominance,
l am now off to Earth

49:58.920 --> 50:01.880
to eliminate those pesky experiments!
Ah!

50:12.400 --> 50:17.040
My years of devotion and hard work,
and this is how l'm rewarded?

50:17.120 --> 50:18.360
You are right.

50:18.440 --> 50:21.120
That gerbil treats you
like a pile of blitznak.

50:21.200 --> 50:24.400
See, his problem is
he's got no aloha spirit.

50:24.520 --> 50:27.040
But that will come back
and bite him in the tail someday.

50:27.160 --> 50:31.640
'Cause you know, the aloha spirit
you give always comes back to you.

50:31.560 --> 50:33.440
At least that's what Lilo says.

50:33.520 --> 50:37.040
Though it looks like
her spirit's kind of broken.

51:03.960 --> 51:07.400
Nani says aloha means
''hello'' and ''goodbye,''

51:07.480 --> 51:13.040
but for us,
it mostly seems to mean goodbye.

51:18.680 --> 51:20.960
You know, turns out l'm pretty strong.

51:21.040 --> 51:22.960
l could maybe open this.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.640
Whoa! Ha-ha! l am strong!

51:26.720 --> 51:29.680
You didn't open the cell. l did.

51:29.800 --> 51:32.680
l'm breaking you two out of here.

625, when did you learn
to climb ceilings?

52:06.280 --> 52:08.320
The name is Reuben.

52:09.520 --> 52:13.400
Once we're through this airlock,
it's clear sailing to the spaceport.

52:13.480 --> 52:16.120
- [gibberish]
- Uh-oh.

52:24.600 --> 52:29.560
Hey, this looks like Pleakley's rock,
with a bite out of it.

52:38.160 --> 52:40.040
Stitch!

52:44.200 --> 52:47.440
- Ah!
- How did you get here?

52:47.520 --> 52:50.360
- No time explaining.
- Hurry! Get in!

52:52.960 --> 52:56.200
- Whaah! Gantu?
- No time explaining.

52:56.280 --> 52:59.400
We've got to get back to Earth
and save the cousins.

52:59.480 --> 53:01.640
Well, how will we all fit?

53:01.720 --> 53:04.440

53:29.000 --> 53:31.480
l wonder what they got
in store for us.

53:31.560 --> 53:34.000
l heard Hamsterviel
is taking over the galaxy

53:34.080 --> 53:36.200
and he brought us
all here to get rid of us.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.760
lt's OK.
We're just having a nightmare.

53:38.880 --> 53:40.720
You know, l had a nightmare once.

53:40.840 --> 53:42.960
l had to take a test on spaghetti.
l studied rigatoni.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.160
l was late for class.
l was naked, fell off a cliff,

53:45.240 --> 53:47.160

Uh, that was a rhetorical question.
