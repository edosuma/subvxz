WEBVTT

00:07.091 --> 00:10.834
Where's your fucking chain now?

00:11.012 --> 00:12.252
Cunt!

00:14.640 --> 00:15.846
Dumb-ass ponytail.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.268
Here we go.

00:24.859 --> 00:27.726
-I love you.
-I love you too, baby.

00:34.452 --> 00:38.411
Well, fuck you, Fido.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.123
The fuck?

00:56.098 --> 00:58.134
Show your fucking face, freak!

02:50.755 --> 02:52.916
It is too bad I don’t have fangs.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.250
Oh, yeah!

02:54.425 --> 02:56.256
-Rip your fucking throat out.
-Oh, yeah.

02:56.427 --> 02:59.260
Fuck, yeah. Here it comes.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.170
Are you ready?

03:01.557 --> 03:04.424
Fuck. Oh, fuck, yeah!

03:15.363 --> 03:17.570
That was intense, huh?

03:21.660 --> 03:23.241
Ma udette ?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.456
Hey.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.288
Maudette.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.248
Oh, Shit.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.709
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

03:43.099 --> 03:45.090
Oh, Jesus.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.490
What a moron.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.164
I didn't kill her.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.833
I didn't kill her.

04:18.342 --> 04:21.004
Well, somebody sure as hell did.

04:32.690 --> 04:34.305
A vampire.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.689
You're sure?

04:35.860 --> 04:37.020
Oh, yeah.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.185
Yeah, I saw his fangs.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.696
Hey, Maudette had fang marks
on her innerthigh.

04:42.992 --> 04:45.199
We know. We examined the body.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.449
Okay.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.657
This be the same vampire
your sister's messing around with?

04:49.832 --> 04:52.824
Okay, first, my sister ain't
messing around with nobody.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.367
My sister don't mess around.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.251
And second...

04:57.423 --> 05:00.756
I don't know. I never met that vampire.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.508
I never met any vampire,
and I hope to hell I never do.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.045
What'd this vampire
on the videotape look like?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.135
Bald-headed.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.142
Weird skeleton tattoo.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.058
And he looked crazy.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.062
Crazy out of his motherfucking mind.

05:21.238 --> 05:25.197
It's interesting,
because this the only videotape...

05:25.367 --> 05:27.699
...we found in Maudette's apartment.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.787
Well, I guess that means
somebody took them all, right?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.868
Somebody didn't want you to see them?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.914
Or somebody only wanted us
to find this one?

05:39.131 --> 05:41.588
Because it supposedly
clears him of a crime...

05:41.759 --> 05:45.001
...that maybe he came back later
to commit?

05:51.810 --> 05:54.187
Come on, Andy.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.103
I'm not that smart.

06:01.946 --> 06:03.777
SooMe.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.610
SooMe.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.451
I can't feel my legs.

06:24.969 --> 06:27.085
Quick, drink before the wound closes.

06:27.263 --> 06:28.969
-Would I be a vampire?
-You won't be.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.266
Goddamn it, Sookie,
do you wanna live or not?

06:33.852 --> 06:35.012
No.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.479
Go back to the green room.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.186
Turns out that I'm ﬁrst
in the walk-and—ta/k challenge.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.567
Walking and talking
can't be too hard, right?

07:25.738 --> 07:27.945
B.J., your category is
Names of U. 8. States.

07:32.828 --> 07:33.863
Arizona.

07:34.038 --> 07:37.075
-Oh, Mama, damn.
-Alabama. Mississippi.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.364
Memphis.

07:38.751 --> 07:42.039
New Jersey.
New York. Connecticut.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.339
Hello, hooker. What's the T?

07:51.513 --> 07:53.094
Where are you?

07:53.265 --> 07:55.221
I'm on my way to a party in Monroe.

07:55.392 --> 07:59.635
And hell, no, I ain't swinging by
to pick your needy ass up, hooker.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.394
Lafayette, please.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.226
My mama's passed out on the couch...

08:03.400 --> 08:06.142
...and I can't face cleaning her up
and putting her to bed.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.311
It's just too goddamn depressing.

08:08.489 --> 08:11.356
What's depressing is how often
I get this phone call from you.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.034
That's depressing.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.568
Why come you won't call
Jason Stackhouse?

08:15.954 --> 08:17.410
You a mean, nasty bitch.

08:17.581 --> 08:20.243
And you need to move your sorry ass
out your mama house.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.033
-That's what you needs to do.
-Yeah, whatever.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.411
Well, all right.

08:25.589 --> 08:28.205
All right, l's on my way.

08:28.384 --> 08:30.716
But you might got to find
your own ride home.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.922
Just in case | get lucky.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.587
What you mean, if you get lucky?

08:34.765 --> 08:37.427
Your standards are so low,
you always get lucky.

08:38.769 --> 08:42.762
Damn straight. Hallelujahs, hallelujahs.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.978
Good Lord, I'm coming.

08:48.404 --> 08:50.269
Jesus.

08:50.948 --> 08:54.111
Jason, what the fuck?

08:56.286 --> 08:58.538
Did I say you could come in?

09:06.839 --> 09:08.955
Look, Jason, it's 3:00 in the morning.

09:09.133 --> 09:12.671
You have no idea what I've been through
since last night.

09:14.304 --> 09:18.718
I spent the whole day thinking
I'd really killed Maudette Pickens.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.850
Oh, my God.

09:26.191 --> 09:29.524
I thought I'd accidentally
strangled her during sex.

09:30.821 --> 09:35.064
And Bud and fucking Andy
waited 12 whole hours...

09:35.242 --> 09:39.110
...to show me a videotape
that proved I didn't do it.

09:44.126 --> 09:47.368
I thought I'd ruined my whole life.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.706
Jason.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.355
Do | taste different from other people?

10:18.494 --> 10:20.200
Yes.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.535
What are you?

10:22.706 --> 10:26.039
Well, apparently I'm not dead.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.708
What I am is telepathic.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.964
I can hear people's thoughts.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.804
-Even mine?
-No.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.590
That's why I like you so much.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.594
I can't hear you at all.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.225
You have no idea how peaceful it is...

10:49.399 --> 10:54.393
...after a lifetime of blah, blah, blah.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.092
May | ask you a personal question?

11:23.976 --> 11:27.343
Bill, you were just
licking blood out of my head.

11:27.521 --> 11:31.059
I don't think it gets
much more personal than that.

11:32.442 --> 11:37.152
How do you manage a social life
with men your own age?

11:37.322 --> 11:40.029
-Their only thought must be--
-I don't date.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.450
-Ever?
-Oh, I've--

11:44.121 --> 11:45.782
I've been on a few dates.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.493
I can't wait to see her naked.
I wonder if she's a natural blond.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.954
Nothing worse than a blond
with a big, black bush.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.459
What the heck?

11:53.630 --> 11:56.042
Not every guy was a pig.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.208
Kind of girl I could marry
and spend the rest of my life loving.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.297
Never have those thoughts
of Matt Damon...

12:01.471 --> 12:04.759
...Jake Gyl/enhaal in Jarhead,
when he had that little Santa hat on--

12:04.933 --> 12:06.969
Hey, where you going? What's wrong?

12:08.854 --> 12:12.392
But it always ends up the same.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.353
There must be some people
who know about your talent.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.813
The people closest to me.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.980
But we never talk about it.

12:22.284 --> 12:25.151
And I do my best
to stay out of their heads.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.570
Over the years, I've learned how.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.245
It's kind of unethical...

12:29.416 --> 12:32.749
...to listen in to my family
and my friends, my boss.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.831
But they know.

12:35.005 --> 12:38.964
Other people suspect
or they think I'm psychic.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.708
Most people just think I'm crazy.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.387
What does it sound like?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.639
It's sort of like...

12:48.769 --> 12:51.727
...a stream Of COl'lSClOUSl'leSS.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.562
Gets weirder when people are mad...

12:54.733 --> 12:57.850
...or upset, and sometimes...

13:04.701 --> 13:07.363
Sometimes it's just images.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.929
I should be getting home.

13:38.402 --> 13:41.189
Wow, I feel completely healed.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.899
You are.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.408
Do doctors know
that V-juice can do this?

13:48.829 --> 13:50.319
No.

13:51.123 --> 13:53.239
We wanna keep it that way.

13:58.422 --> 14:01.004
I should show you to your car.

14:23.822 --> 14:27.110
-Look at this motherfucker.
-What's up, Joe?

14:27.617 --> 14:30.279
Sexy ass over there.

14:30.996 --> 14:33.658
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.539
Hey, big boy. What's up, you?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.582
-They said they were.
-Oh, no.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.468
What's up, baby?

14:53.977 --> 14:56.138
-l'm Terrell.
-Tara.

14:56.313 --> 14:59.100
Tara. All right, all right, all right.

14:59.274 --> 15:02.732
So, what's a fine girl like you...

15:02.903 --> 15:04.814
...doing sitting here all by herself?

15:04.988 --> 15:08.731
I'm watching my fool cousin
trying to hit on the straightest man here.

15:13.538 --> 15:14.653
All right.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.994
Well, baby,
I am the straightest man here.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.163
Really?

15:20.587 --> 15:24.330
You can just ask
any one of these honeys.

15:24.508 --> 15:27.124
Look, I should tell you.

15:27.302 --> 15:28.337
I'm married.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.883
Yeah. Blackwater.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.974
He just got back from
assassinating some guys in Iraq.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.228
You making that shit up.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.766
| wish I was. Because he ain't worth me,
I can tell you that.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.402
But if he ever caught me
with another man...

15:47.572 --> 15:48.652
...he'd kill us both.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.615
I'm not sure who he'd kill first.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.696
Probably me.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.240
I hope so.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.663
Bitch, you crazy.

15:58.834 --> 16:02.793
He already shot one guy in the nuts
just for buying me a CD.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.797
Hell, no.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.398
Fuck. Fuck.

16:41.084 --> 16:44.167
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

16:46.798 --> 16:49.414
-This how you wanna play, huh?
-Yeah.

16:55.265 --> 16:56.300
Yeah.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.473
How old are you?

16:59.644 --> 17:00.975
Am I allowed to ask that?

17:01.146 --> 17:03.933
l was made a vampire in 1865.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.472
When I was 30 human years old.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.232
Wow, you look older than that.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.106
Life was harder then.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.237
Were you in the Civil War?

17:13.408 --> 17:14.443
l was.

17:14.618 --> 17:17.075
Would you be willing
to talk to my grandmother's club?

17:17.245 --> 17:20.829
It's mostly a bunch of old people
who had family in the war.

17:20.999 --> 17:24.708
They call themselves
the Descendants of the Glorious Dead.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.994
The Glorious Dead?

17:28.298 --> 17:30.880
There is nothing glorious
about dying in a war.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.962
Bunch of starving, freezing boys..

17:33.136 --> 17:36.424
...killing each other
so the rich people can stay rich.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.300
Madness.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.096
I'm sure it was awful.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.481
Would it make you happy if I did this?

17:52.656 --> 17:55.193
Oh, it would make
my grandmother ecstatic.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.780
Would it make you happy?

18:01.498 --> 18:02.988
Well....

18:04.960 --> 18:06.700
Yes.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.625
I'll do it, then.

18:18.056 --> 18:21.014
I look fon/vard
to meeting your grandmother.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.016
When may I call on you?

18:25.480 --> 18:28.267
I'm off work tomorrow.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.066
Just after dark, then.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.029
Sam's still up.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.082
Well, that's creepy.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.164
We never should have
given them the vote...

19:29.336 --> 19:31.372
...and legitimized their unholy existence.

19:31.546 --> 19:34.413
The American people need to know
these are creatures of Satan.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.707
Demons, literally. They have no soul.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.217
But, Reverend New/in,
you must be aware of polls...

19:39.387 --> 19:42.094
...that show growing support
for vampire rights.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.300
Those polls are ﬁxed.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.591
Know how much money
the monsters have given...

19:45.769 --> 19:48.602
...to politicians of both parties?
As well as corporate media?

19:48.772 --> 19:51.514
Nonsense. Vampires
don't seek to control human policy.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.306
It's of very little interest to us.

19:53.485 --> 19:57.353
-We want the same rights as humans--
-You can’t trace it. It’s all been laundered.

19:57.530 --> 20:01.022
Are you accusing my organization
of criminal activity, sir?

20:01.576 --> 20:03.692
I will not speak to her direct/y, Sharon.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.782
-Why is that, Reverend New/in?
-My commitment to Christ Jesus...

20:06.956 --> 20:10.198
...praise his name,
compels me not to recognize her kind.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.709
That's gonna make it difficult
to have a dialogue.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.961
I will not speak to her direct/y.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.120
Okay.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.130
Thank you, Sharon. Now, TBBN--

20:21.805 --> 20:24.797
I don't think Jesus would mind
if somebody was a vampire.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.757
I don't either, honey.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.897
Is this sausage different
from what you usually make?

20:35.068 --> 20:36.399
No.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.812
It tastes so much more complex
than it usually does

20:40.990 --> 20:43.197
Oh, dear, you think it's gone bad?

20:43.368 --> 20:46.360
No, it's delicious.
It's like I can close my eyes...

20:46.538 --> 20:48.620
...and I can see the farm
the pig lived on...

20:48.790 --> 20:50.655
...and feel the sun and rain
on my face...

20:50.834 --> 20:54.543
...and even taste the earth
that the herbs grew out of.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.292
Hey, Miss Stackhouse.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.591
Good morning, Tara.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.210
No, you sit down.

21:04.973 --> 21:07.635
-|'|| make a new pot.
-All right.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.973
-You look awful.
-Yeah.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.683
| feel even worse.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.685
-Can--?
-Yes, you can take a shower here.

21:16.860 --> 21:20.102
-And you can borrow some of my clothes.
-Thanks

21:20.280 --> 21:21.690
Any news about Jason?

21:21.865 --> 21:24.857
Yeah, we heard from Everly already.
They let him go last night.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.695
-I knew they would.
-I didn't.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.193
Well, I'm glad to see you're still alive.

21:29.372 --> 21:32.830
You obviously did not hook up
with that vampire last night.

21:33.543 --> 21:36.330
-Sookie, sometimes you are just plain dumb.
-Shut up.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.881
Lucky Gran was in bed
when I got in last night.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.333
-Did he bite you?
-No.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.590
Are you sure?
You know they can hypnotize you.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.048
Yeah, and black people are lazy
and Jews have horns

21:47.599 --> 21:50.762
You must be glad they let Jason go,
huh, Miss Stackhouse?

21:50.935 --> 21:54.098
I can't even believe
that they arrested him to begin with.

21:54.272 --> 21:57.389
l have a good mind to call Bud Dearborne
and chew him out.

21:57.567 --> 22:00.149
Jason's a good boy.
Everybody knows that.

22:03.573 --> 22:04.904
Hello.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.407
Hey, Everly.

22:08.369 --> 22:11.076
I'm sorry I was such a bitch
to you last night.

22:11.247 --> 22:14.114
Well, I'm sorry I been acting
like I'm your mother.

22:14.292 --> 22:17.534
| just worry about you, Sookie.
You're basically my only friend.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.540
Am I too late for breakfast?
Hey, Tara.

22:20.715 --> 22:24.082
Hey. Hey, Jason.
I'm so glad they didn't lock you up.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.677
Yeah. Me too.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.213
I don't even know
why they suspected me.

22:30.934 --> 22:33.016
I think somebody heard
I'd been with Maudette.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.221
Had you?

22:34.395 --> 22:35.430
-No.
-Are you sure?

22:35.772 --> 22:37.888
She was a woman.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.931
That's funny. At least she was human.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.609
You will never believe what happened.

22:43.780 --> 22:44.860
-Hey, Jason.
-Hey, Gran.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.067
You sit down. I'll fix you breakfast.

22:47.242 --> 22:48.607
-Yes
-What happened?

22:48.785 --> 22:52.152
Well, apparently...

22:52.330 --> 22:56.573
...a tornado touched down
over at Four Tracks Corners

22:56.751 --> 23:00.414
It turned over that rent trailer
in the clearing. You know the one?

23:01.881 --> 23:05.965
And it killed that couple
that's been staying in there.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.758
Mack and Denise Rattray?

23:08.304 --> 23:09.965
They were trapped under the trailer.

23:10.139 --> 23:14.132
Mike Spencer said
they were crushed to a pulp.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.785
Well, Sookie Stackhouse.

24:20.209 --> 24:23.827
-What are you doing here?
-Sookie, you know Mike Spencer.

24:24.005 --> 24:26.371
Of course. You buried my parents

24:26.549 --> 24:29.712
Yep. Got a newjob. Parish coroner.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.877
But I still run the funeral home.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.511
That's gotta be convenient.

24:35.058 --> 24:39.597
Sookie, this is still
a restricted crime scene.

24:39.771 --> 24:41.227
Why are you here?

24:41.397 --> 24:44.264
When I heard what happened,
I just had to come look.

24:44.442 --> 24:46.023
What an awful thing.

24:46.194 --> 24:49.231
You know, I did hear
you weren't too fond of the Rattrays.

24:49.572 --> 24:50.937
Where'd you hear that?

24:51.115 --> 24:53.902
My niece is the emergency-room
nurse in Monroe.

24:54.077 --> 24:57.194
Says somebody busted up
old Mack pretty bad last night.

24:57.372 --> 25:00.739
-Everybody says that was you.
-They were hurting a friend of mine.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.328
This be that vampire
I been hearing about?

25:03.503 --> 25:05.960
The one who's living
at the old Compton house?

25:06.130 --> 25:07.290
The old Compton house?

25:07.465 --> 25:09.922
-Across the field from where | live?
-That's the one.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.425
Your grandmother lets you
associate with a vampire?

25:12.595 --> 25:14.096
You can take that up with her.

25:14.263 --> 25:18.302
I'm sure she'd love to know that somebody
thinks she's not taking proper care of me.

25:18.476 --> 25:19.932
The Rattrays were draining him.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.264
Draining vampires
is against the law, isn't it?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.394
l was doing my civic duty
by stopping them.

25:24.565 --> 25:25.600
And now they're dead.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.857
Yeah. Killed by a tornado.

25:28.027 --> 25:31.690
Tornadoes hop.
This one didn't land anywhere else.

25:31.864 --> 25:36.324
And nobody around here heard or saw
anything like a tornado last night.

25:36.494 --> 25:39.907
Are you telling me you seriously
think one man could do all this?

25:40.081 --> 25:41.366
He's not a man.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.249
They're not that different
from you and me...

25:45.420 --> 25:47.160
...if you bothered to get to know one.

25:47.338 --> 25:49.454
Sookie, you're a good girl.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.961
I hate to see you go down this path.

25:53.136 --> 25:56.344
Well, lucky for you, Sheriff Dearborne,
nobody's forcing you to watch.

25:56.514 --> 25:59.802
Now, if y'all two rednecks
will excuse me, I gotta go.

26:12.822 --> 26:15.029
You know,
he sleeps in the ground all day.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.451
I don't think he's gonna even
look at the rug.

26:17.618 --> 26:20.325
I'm not doing this for him,
I'm doing this for me.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.157
So I can be proud of my home.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.492
And how do you know
where he sleeps?

26:25.168 --> 26:27.375
I don't, actually.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.541
What's that smell?

26:33.176 --> 26:35.132
What smell?

26:35.303 --> 26:37.214
It smells like rotten food
or something.

26:37.388 --> 26:38.628
You can't smell that?

26:40.600 --> 26:41.840
Well, find it.

26:56.491 --> 26:58.607
You can't smell this?

27:02.246 --> 27:03.497
I better throw this out.

27:06.876 --> 27:09.538
-SooMe.
-Yeah?

27:09.712 --> 27:12.704
Jason and Tara are coming over
this evening as well.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.464
-Gran.
-Well, they invited themselves.

27:15.635 --> 27:19.048
Jason said that he wants to meet
the vampire for himself.

27:19.222 --> 27:21.804
And Tara said she thought
she ought to be here as well.

27:21.974 --> 27:25.683
I don't know why everyone's getting their
panties in a wad about some vampire.

27:26.938 --> 27:29.475
Did you want to be alone with him?

27:30.900 --> 27:32.561
I don't know.

27:33.361 --> 27:34.396
Maybe.

27:36.489 --> 27:39.071
Aren't you gonna tell me to be careful?

27:39.909 --> 27:43.572
You're always careful, Sookie,
about what counts.

27:43.746 --> 27:46.909
And I can depend on that.
Isn't that right?

28:05.768 --> 28:07.008
Look, I'm just saying.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.302
Do you want a vampire
sucking blood out of you?

28:09.480 --> 28:11.812
I'm just trying to get to know
the man, that's all.

28:11.983 --> 28:14.474
Because that's where it's gonna end up.
Always does

28:14.652 --> 28:16.859
What do you know
about vampires, anyway?

28:17.655 --> 28:19.611
Yeah, I know a lot more than I care to.

28:19.782 --> 28:20.817
Oh, please, Jason.

28:20.992 --> 28:23.699
You ain't even got enough sense
to pour piss out of a boot.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.291
That's my beer.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.620
You asked if I wanted anything
to drink...

28:32.128 --> 28:33.959
...and I said I'd have a beer.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.416
And that's when you went to the fridge.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.299
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Here.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.300
It's okay.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.275
Bill, I don't like it
when you do that.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.566
I've upset you.

29:05.536 --> 29:07.037
No.

29:08.998 --> 29:11.330
Well, since you're here....

29:16.923 --> 29:18.754
What's wrong?

29:19.508 --> 29:21.920
You have to invite me in.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.754
Othen/vise it's physically impossible
for me to enter a mortal's home.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.719
Seriously?

29:28.893 --> 29:30.679
Well, come on, try.

29:31.020 --> 29:34.638
I can't. I can't even try.

29:35.608 --> 29:38.475
That is so weird.

29:39.362 --> 29:43.696
-Oh, Bill, won't you please come in?
-Thank you.

29:43.866 --> 29:46.573
So if I were to withdraw my invitation...

29:46.744 --> 29:48.780
...would you have to leave?

29:52.416 --> 29:54.748
I'll have to remember that.

30:07.890 --> 30:08.970
Oh, my stars

30:09.558 --> 30:11.810
Of course. You don't--

30:16.273 --> 30:18.264
I'm sorry.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.859
Your people, Mr. Compton...

30:26.033 --> 30:28.240
...they were from this area, I believe.

30:28.411 --> 30:30.743
Yeah, my father's people
were Comptons...

30:30.913 --> 30:33.325
...and my mother's people
were Loudermilks.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.410
Oh, there are a lot of Loudermilks left.

30:35.584 --> 30:39.418
But I'm afraid old Mr. Jesse Compton
died last year.

30:39.588 --> 30:40.919
Yes, ma'am.

30:41.090 --> 30:42.830
That's why I came back to Bon Temps.

30:43.801 --> 30:48.170
There were no living Comptons, so I've
set up home in the old Compton place.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.463
And as I expect the VRA to pass--

30:50.641 --> 30:53.599
Yeah, I wouldn't be too sure
about that if I were you.

30:55.813 --> 30:59.772
A lot of Americans don't think
you people deserve special rights

30:59.942 --> 31:01.557
They're the same rights you have.

31:01.736 --> 31:04.728
No, I'm just saying there's a reason
things are the way they are.

31:04.905 --> 31:07.442
Yeah. It's called injustice.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.942
-Listen, it's called "this is how we do it."
-Jason.

31:12.496 --> 31:15.112
This is my house.
I will not tolerate rudeness.

31:22.673 --> 31:25.790
Did you know the Stackhouses,
Mr. Compton?

31:25.968 --> 31:27.583
Yes.

31:28.179 --> 31:31.137
I remember Jonas Stackhouse.

31:31.307 --> 31:32.638
He and his wife moved here...

31:32.808 --> 31:36.221
...when Bon Temps
was just a hole in the road.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.473
I was a young man of 16.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.731
Isn't this the house he built?
I mean, at least in part?

31:42.902 --> 31:44.062
Yes, it was.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.487
Did you own slaves?

31:45.654 --> 31:46.780
Tara.

31:49.992 --> 31:52.278
I did not, but my father did.

31:53.621 --> 31:54.827
A house slave...

31:54.997 --> 31:58.410
...a middle-aged woman
whose name I cannot recall...

31:58.584 --> 32:01.246
...and a yard slave...

32:01.420 --> 32:03.832
...a young, strong man named Minas.

32:04.006 --> 32:08.340
Oh, this is just the sort of thing my club
will be so interested in hearing about.

32:08.511 --> 32:09.751
About slaves?

32:10.805 --> 32:15.265
Well, about anything
having to do with that time.

32:20.397 --> 32:24.481
I look fon/vard to speaking
to your club, Mrs. Stackhouse.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.900
Now...

32:27.071 --> 32:28.936
...if it's all right with you...

32:29.115 --> 32:32.027
...I thought that Sookie and I
might take a walk.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.988
It's such a lovely night.

32:36.789 --> 32:38.029
Well...

32:39.125 --> 32:41.286
...it's all right with me...

32:41.460 --> 32:43.291
...if it's all right with Sookie.

32:45.798 --> 32:49.290
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-I don't think it's any of your business.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.845
She's right, Jason.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.173
Look, Gran, I am the man in this family--

32:54.348 --> 32:58.466
You are a man in this family,
but I am the oldest person here...

32:58.644 --> 33:01.761
...and this is my house.
You better respect me, boy.

33:01.939 --> 33:02.974
Actually...

33:04.066 --> 33:06.398
...I'm the oldest person here.

33:09.697 --> 33:11.233
Shall we?

33:12.283 --> 33:13.989
We shall.

33:24.837 --> 33:27.829
Thanks for making me
look like a fool in front of him, Gran.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.372
Jason”.

33:30.551 --> 33:33.088
...you don't need any help
looking like a fool.

33:36.265 --> 33:38.927
I went to the Rattrays' trailer.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.262
I told you I was strong.

33:41.645 --> 33:46.105
I don't believe I fully gauged
the extent of your strength.

33:46.609 --> 33:48.691
Over the years, we become stronger...

33:48.861 --> 33:51.443
...and more skillful
at hiding what we've done.

33:51.614 --> 33:54.902
You might wanna remember,
for next time, tornadoes hop.

33:55.075 --> 33:58.112
They don'tjust land in one place.

34:01.290 --> 34:04.782
So I guess you've killed a lot of people.

34:05.252 --> 34:07.288
I killed a few by accident at first.

34:07.463 --> 34:10.500
I was never sure when
I was gonna get my next feed.

34:11.008 --> 34:12.293
But it's all different now.

34:13.469 --> 34:14.675
There's Tru Blood.

34:15.429 --> 34:18.466
I can get donor blood
from a clinic in Monroe.

34:18.641 --> 34:22.304
Or I can glamour someone
into letting me feed on them for love...

34:22.478 --> 34:24.810
...and then they'll forget all about it.

34:25.481 --> 34:27.392
Did you feed on the Rattrays?

34:27.900 --> 34:28.935
Yes.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.809
After I'd given you my blood,
while you were healing.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.480
You drank a lot of my blood.

34:36.825 --> 34:38.656
What'll that do to me?

34:38.827 --> 34:41.318
Well, you'll have keener senses.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.453
What else?

34:47.336 --> 34:49.668
Your libido will be more active.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.878
Is that it?

34:57.972 --> 35:00.429
I'll always be able to feel you.

35:00.891 --> 35:03.132
I'll be able to find you fast.

35:04.103 --> 35:07.516
If you're ever in trouble,
that could come in quite handy.

35:13.404 --> 35:15.816
You're gonna have to give me
a minute here, Bill.

35:15.990 --> 35:19.198
I'm feeling a little ovenNhelmed.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.319
Of course.

35:43.684 --> 35:46.471
I don't know why your grandmother
was so short with you.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.022
You're just trying to protect Sookie.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.476
Like I'm still just a kid...

35:55.863 --> 35:57.728
...or, I don't know, in the way.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.897
I know what that's like.

36:00.242 --> 36:02.028
It sucks, that's what it's like.

36:02.202 --> 36:05.694
You feel alone in the world,
like nobody understands you...

36:05.873 --> 36:06.988
...or even sees you.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.906
Yeah. Sucks

36:09.668 --> 36:10.748
That ain't right...

36:10.919 --> 36:13.251
...because everybody is,
you know, somebody.

36:15.424 --> 36:16.413
What?

36:16.592 --> 36:20.210
We're all just trying to be--
Trying to be seen, to--

36:20.721 --> 36:22.427
To matter.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.759
Yeah.

36:26.268 --> 36:27.849
You're right.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.348
How'd you get to be so smart?

36:32.941 --> 36:35.273
I'm not smart at all, Jason. I'm not.

36:35.444 --> 36:38.902
I am constantly doing things I shouldn't
and end up getting me in trouble.

36:39.073 --> 36:42.406
-Yeah?
-I'm a fucking idiot sometimes.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.610
Well, can I tell you a secret?

36:45.788 --> 36:47.119
I am too.

36:47.664 --> 36:50.280
It's not that much of a secret.

36:50.793 --> 36:53.000
-What? What?
-Come here.

36:54.171 --> 36:56.787
"Not that much of a secret."

37:02.304 --> 37:03.965
Shit.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.347
I was supposed to pick up Dawn
from work.

37:08.811 --> 37:10.426
Goddamn it.

37:12.189 --> 37:14.646
She gonna be all pissed.

37:15.526 --> 37:19.644
-Night, Gran.
-Night, Jason. Drive careful.

37:23.617 --> 37:25.448
Well, shit.

37:26.662 --> 37:29.574
You said you could glamour somebody
into letting you bite them?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.329
What is that, hypnosis?

37:31.500 --> 37:33.582
Kind of. It's similar.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.334
All humans are susceptible to it.

37:37.423 --> 37:40.335
-Have you done it to me?
-No.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.500
-And I never will.
-Really?

37:43.011 --> 37:44.467
Try it.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.591
No.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.845
-I don't feel comfortable with that.
-You chicken?

38:12.583 --> 38:14.323
SooMe.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.870
Yes?

38:20.591 --> 38:23.128
Can you feel my influence?

38:29.349 --> 38:31.726
No, not a bit. Sorry.

38:33.270 --> 38:35.511
Well, Sookie, this is very strange.

38:35.689 --> 38:39.022
You don't like not being able to
control people, do you?

38:40.944 --> 38:43.151
It's not a very attractive trait, Bill.

38:43.822 --> 38:47.360
Humans are usually more squeamish
about vampires than you are.

38:49.411 --> 38:52.198
Who am I to be squeamish
about something out of the ordinary?

38:53.332 --> 38:57.075
Sookie, Jason, y'all get out
of the water, now.

38:59.880 --> 39:02.747
How can our car insurance go up
so much after just one ticket?

39:02.925 --> 39:06.383
Damn it all to hell, I hate having to ask
my mother-in-law for money again.

39:06.553 --> 39:07.588
Damn what all to hell?

39:08.347 --> 39:11.680
I can break open my piggy bank
if you need some money.

39:12.226 --> 39:14.683
Sookie, who told you we need money?

39:14.853 --> 39:16.263
Mama.

39:17.272 --> 39:20.355
Corbett, I swear,
I haven't spoken a word.

39:20.526 --> 39:24.690
Sookie, do you know why you're here?

39:25.906 --> 39:31.196
Your parents, they're concerned
about something that can't possibly exist.

39:31.370 --> 39:36.114
But you and I are gonna
put all this silliness to rest today.

39:36.291 --> 39:39.533
Now, can you tell me what I'm thinking?

39:40.212 --> 39:43.796
I'm thinking about the color red
and the number nine.

39:43.966 --> 39:47.458
The color red and the number nine.

39:50.138 --> 39:53.630
The psychologist thinks that
Sookie just reads our body language...

39:53.809 --> 39:56.300
...and is highly observant, that's all.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.810
Well, that's a relief.

39:58.981 --> 40:00.266
That's bullshit.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.475
Isn't it?

40:01.650 --> 40:02.981
What's body language?

40:03.151 --> 40:05.016
Why was that doctor so scared?

40:05.195 --> 40:07.277
Because she was lying to me, that’s why.

40:07.447 --> 40:11.611
Because there is something to be
scared of inside my little girl.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.614
Oh, my God.
She knows everything I'm thinking.

40:15.956 --> 40:17.912
Oh, sweet Jesus. What do I do?

40:18.083 --> 40:20.495
Poor child. She can't....

40:28.218 --> 40:30.379
I was diagnosed with ADD.

40:30.554 --> 40:33.341
They tried to put me on drugs,
but my mama wouldn't let them.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.676
She knew that wasn't it.

40:36.518 --> 40:40.352
She tried to protect me,
even though I scared her.

40:42.274 --> 40:43.639
When did you lose her?

40:44.443 --> 40:46.525
Just before I turned 8.

40:46.695 --> 40:47.855
Both my parents

40:48.030 --> 40:49.861
Flash flood.

40:51.491 --> 40:54.028
I lost my wife and my children.

40:54.578 --> 40:57.411
Everyone I knew from my human life.

40:58.332 --> 41:00.414
Most of them are buried here
in this cemetery.

41:00.584 --> 41:03.951
You really don't consider
yourself human at all?

41:05.255 --> 41:07.166
I'm not human.

41:16.266 --> 41:18.473
Can you turn into a bat?

41:19.019 --> 41:20.054
No.

41:20.228 --> 41:23.095
There are those who can change form,
but I'm not one of them.

41:23.273 --> 41:26.106
-Can you levitate?
-No.

41:26.276 --> 41:29.609
-Turn invisible?
-Sorry.

41:29.780 --> 41:34.570
Well, Bill, you don't seem like
a very good vampire.

41:34.743 --> 41:36.074
What can you do?

41:38.080 --> 41:40.742
I can bring you back to life.

41:56.682 --> 41:58.764
This is where you live?

41:58.934 --> 42:01.596
Since old Jesse Compton
had no living heirs when he died...

42:01.770 --> 42:03.260
...ownership reverts back to me.

42:03.438 --> 42:05.929
I thought that wasn't for sure
unless the VRA passes

42:06.108 --> 42:10.442
Well, I haven't been getting any trouble
with the renovations I've been doing.

42:10.612 --> 42:14.446
Although, of course,
I've been doing them myself in the night.

42:14.783 --> 42:18.617
I need an electrician,
but I can't get anyone to return my calls.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.911
Maybe if I made a few calls tomorrow...

42:22.082 --> 42:27.452
...I could come by after work
and tell you who to contact.

42:30.966 --> 42:32.456
Thank you.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.636
Take your clip out.

42:57.951 --> 42:59.487
May I?

43:39.242 --> 43:42.405
I can smell the sunlight on your skin.

44:12.567 --> 44:14.728
I should see you home.

44:17.405 --> 44:19.020
All right.

44:24.412 --> 44:25.492
What's the matter, baby?

44:25.664 --> 44:26.744
Don't you like me?

44:26.915 --> 44:29.201
Oh, sure, I like you, Jason.

44:29.376 --> 44:32.584
I wouldn't tie any old man up to my bed.

44:33.004 --> 44:37.088
So call in sick. Sam won't mind.

44:37.717 --> 44:39.844
One, Sam would mind.

44:40.011 --> 44:42.218
And two, we've had sex,
like, three times today.

44:42.389 --> 44:45.096
At this rate, we're gonna burn out
by the end of the week.

44:45.267 --> 44:47.804
And then you're gonna
get all weird and closed-off...

44:47.978 --> 44:51.266
...and I've already been down
that road with you, baby.

44:52.190 --> 44:53.475
But I'm horny.

44:53.650 --> 44:56.141
Well, I'll be back by midnight.

44:57.320 --> 45:02.235
Hey, you're not--
You're not leaving me here like this.

45:03.618 --> 45:07.736
You just better be happy
that's all I'm doing to you, baby.

45:08.331 --> 45:09.741
What?

45:11.960 --> 45:13.325
What--?

45:13.795 --> 45:16.707
You can just think of it as foreplay.

45:17.674 --> 45:19.960
Foreplay, my-- Dawn!

45:23.930 --> 45:26.546
Okay, this ain't funny, goddamn it.

45:29.394 --> 45:31.760
Goddamn it!

45:31.938 --> 45:33.474
Dawn!

45:33.815 --> 45:35.476
Fuck!

45:36.151 --> 45:37.812
Bitch.

-Hey.

45:46.745 --> 45:48.201
Hey, sugar.

45:48.371 --> 45:51.033
Make Mama another stinger,
would you?

45:52.792 --> 45:55.124
You listen to me, Jane Bodenhouse.

45:55.295 --> 45:57.251
You're already drunk as a skunk.

45:57.631 --> 45:59.963
Ain't no man in here
gonna wanna take you home.

46:00.133 --> 46:04.001
And Sam will have to call your son to
come and get you, just like he always does

46:04.179 --> 46:07.171
Even though everybody knows
it humiliates him to death.

46:07.349 --> 46:09.305
Ain't you ashamed of yourself?

46:10.769 --> 46:12.259
What'd you just say to me?

46:12.437 --> 46:15.099
I said, any particular brand of cognac?

46:15.273 --> 46:19.357
No. Whatever you have
that's nice and cheap.

46:19.527 --> 46:21.358
I told you where
to buy your uniform.

46:21.529 --> 46:23.520
Sam, how come you don't
wear a uniform?

46:23.698 --> 46:25.814
Because I own this place
and wear what I want.

46:25.992 --> 46:29.155
Well, how come Terry Bellefleur
don't wear a uniform?

46:29.329 --> 46:31.786
-Because--
-|'ve spent enough time in uniforms.

46:31.957 --> 46:33.493
No, because you're a man.

46:33.750 --> 46:35.160
And Sam don't feel the need...

46:35.335 --> 46:39.123
...to sexualize the men in his employment
the same way he do the women.

46:40.048 --> 46:41.163
Okay.

46:41.341 --> 46:42.922
You don't have to wear a uniform.

46:43.093 --> 46:44.629
Thank you.

46:45.178 --> 46:46.714
Remind me why I hired you, again.

46:46.888 --> 46:49.049
Affirmative action.

46:56.564 --> 46:59.180
Loaded skins and a pitcher of Bud.
Is that it for y'all?

46:59.359 --> 47:00.724
Yes, ma'am.

47:00.902 --> 47:04.269
If you could serve them nachos
off them pen‘ect titties, we 'd all be obliged.

47:04.447 --> 47:06.028
Ain't nothing I like more
than licking food off a girl's tits.

47:07.200 --> 47:08.565
And that's a fine ass too.

47:10.745 --> 47:14.408
You wanna let go of the lady, you, or
you want me to knock you into next week?

47:14.582 --> 47:17.119
Damn, man, you're about
to break my arm.

47:17.293 --> 47:19.204
Apologize.

47:20.422 --> 47:21.912
Sorry.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.843
Maybe you and your friends
should find someplace else to eat, yeah?

47:32.726 --> 47:34.182
Let's go.

47:35.478 --> 47:36.558
Don't look at me, you.

47:38.606 --> 47:41.598
Rene, you should have let me
handle that myself.

47:42.068 --> 47:45.686
Merlotte's is a nice place.
We all wanna keep it that way.

47:47.032 --> 47:50.069
Besides, you remind me
of my baby sister, you.

47:50.243 --> 47:54.532
I hope to God somebody will stick up for
her if some asshole ever does her that way.

48:04.883 --> 48:08.626
Arlene, would you tell Rene thank you for
helping me out with those jerks tonight?

48:08.803 --> 48:11.055
I was so flustered
I might have seemed ungrateful.

48:11.222 --> 48:12.883
Please let me get my period tonight.

48:13.058 --> 48:14.798
Even though Rene wants one of his own.

48:14.976 --> 48:18.264
But / sure don’t want him
to feel like he's being forced into--

48:20.065 --> 48:21.555
Did you just read my mind?

48:21.733 --> 48:23.519
Sorry. I'm not very focused tonight.

48:23.693 --> 48:26.901
My private thoughts
are none of your business.

48:27.322 --> 48:28.812
SooMe.

48:29.491 --> 48:31.698
You wanna step into my office?

48:34.829 --> 48:37.320
I swear, I try not to listen...

48:37.499 --> 48:39.455
...but I can't always keep my guard up.

48:39.626 --> 48:42.663
Is it true you can't hear
the vampire's thoughts at all?

48:44.964 --> 48:46.340
God, that's--

48:46.508 --> 48:48.544
I mean, that must be
very relaxing for you.

48:48.718 --> 48:53.462
You know, not having
to work so hard not to hear.

48:58.520 --> 49:00.101
Yes.

49:02.482 --> 49:04.473
Can you hear me?

49:06.361 --> 49:08.443
-I don't wanna hear you.
-Why not?

49:08.613 --> 49:11.229
I'd have to quit ifl read
your mind, and I like it here.

49:11.407 --> 49:13.739
-You don't have to quit.
-Sam, I've had to leave...

49:13.910 --> 49:16.697
...everyjob I've had because
I could hear my boss's thoughts.

49:16.871 --> 49:18.736
You might be surprised by what you find.

49:18.915 --> 49:22.078
-Not all surprises are good.
-Try sometime.

49:26.089 --> 49:27.499
Now, listen...

49:28.133 --> 49:29.669
...don't you worry.

49:29.843 --> 49:33.301
You got a job here
as long as you want one.

49:39.727 --> 49:42.218
I should get back to work.

50:00.123 --> 50:03.081
Baby girl, don't even
let that get you down.

50:04.711 --> 50:06.167
Don't let what get me down?

50:06.796 --> 50:09.003
Don't let nothing get you down.

50:09.591 --> 50:12.082
It's the only way to live.

50:15.054 --> 50:18.262
-Ain't that right, Big John?
-That's right.

50:23.021 --> 50:24.056
Hey, how's Jason?

50:24.230 --> 50:26.767
He's probably pretty pissed off
at me right about now...

50:26.941 --> 50:29.432
...but, hell, he probably deserves it.

50:29.611 --> 50:32.694
I have to say, I'm surprised
you and him got back together.

50:32.864 --> 50:35.105
No more than I am, baby. Believe me.

50:35.283 --> 50:36.864
Think it's gonna last?

50:38.411 --> 50:41.118
-Is there a reason you wanna know, Tara?
-No.

50:41.289 --> 50:43.245
Ever since I been friends with Sookie...

50:43.416 --> 50:47.830
...I've just gotten a kick out of watching
Jason's escapades with women, you know.

50:51.299 --> 50:52.414
Sort of.

50:56.012 --> 50:58.253
God only knows what happened
to my tables

50:58.431 --> 50:59.466
In other news...

50:59.641 --> 51:03.475
...a tragic car crash in town
has claimed three lives today....

51:03.645 --> 51:05.476
Hey, turn it up.

51:06.648 --> 51:09.014
