19:31.128 --> 19:33.797
MAYBE I'LL SLIDE YOU
UNDER THERE TO BATTLE THEM.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.173
[both chuckle]

19:35.257 --> 19:38.135
- THAT'S RIGHT.
KICK A MAN WHEN HE'S DOWN.

19:39.177 --> 19:41.430
- DID YOU SAY KISS A MAN
WHEN HE'S DOWN?

19:41.513 --> 19:42.639
- MM.

19:42.723 --> 19:43.307
- [clears throat]

19:45.767 --> 19:47.519
THEY'RE PLOWING THE ROADS.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.688
I CAN GO.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.816
- WELL, IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO MEET YOU, LAVOK.

19:52.900 --> 19:53.817
- THAT'S FINE,

19:53.901 --> 19:56.820
BUT I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT THE MONEY.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.113
- BEG YOUR PARDON?

19:58.196 --> 20:00.616
- METER'S BEEN RUNNING
SINCE I GOT HERE.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.287
MUST BE APPROXIMATELY $712.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.665
- SEVEN HUNDRED AND WHAT?

20:08.749 --> 20:10.000
AHH!

20:11.043 --> 20:13.003
- NOT INCLUDING TIP.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.671
- WELL, MAYBE WE
SHOULD JUST CHARGE YOU

20:14.755 --> 20:16.506
ROOM AND BOARD, PAL.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.841
- FINE.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.093
LET'S MAKE IT $100 DOLLARS,

20:20.177 --> 20:23.430
OR GET ME A DATE
WITH THE FEISTY LADY.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.268
- NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!
