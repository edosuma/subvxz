00:01.126 --> 00:02.075
My brother, jacob greenleaf...

00:02.077 --> 00:03.877
<i>Previously on "greenleaf"...</i>

00:03.879 --> 00:06.063
The plan was to
move triumph over here,

00:06.065 --> 00:08.665
But right here is the new pastor.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.133
Of triumph two,

00:10.135 --> 00:12.753
Jacob greenleaf.

00:16.959 --> 00:19.025
People love to see
the high brought low,

00:19.027 --> 00:20.827
Even if based on
nothing but hearsay.

00:20.829 --> 00:22.279
This friday feature
about churchgoers.

00:22.281 --> 00:23.880
In the d.A.'s office...
Some are saying they're.

00:23.882 --> 00:25.248
Slowing the investigation down.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.750
Written by this darius nash?

00:26.752 --> 00:29.386
What an insidious way
this man has.

00:29.388 --> 00:30.687
You're hired.
There's something that you.

00:30.689 --> 00:32.622
Should know before
you pull that trigger.

00:32.624 --> 00:34.391
Full disclosure... I'm gay.

00:34.393 --> 00:35.926
That's no problem.

00:35.928 --> 00:38.862
Daddy, I need your help.

00:38.864 --> 00:42.482
You know I never could deny you.

00:42.484 --> 00:43.984
What do you need?

00:46.271 --> 00:47.871
You. What are you doing?

00:47.873 --> 00:49.606
Stay the hell out of
my business, you hear me?

00:49.608 --> 00:50.707
I was trying to help.

00:50.709 --> 00:52.476
I told you
he was not the problem.

00:52.478 --> 00:56.179
Kevin, I have no idea what is
going on with the two of you.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.647
Charity, I've been doing
some research.

00:57.649 --> 00:58.915
About what?

00:58.917 --> 01:00.317
What I've been struggling with.

01:00.319 --> 01:01.768
You are what you are.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.186
You can't change that.

01:09.762 --> 01:11.561
We were up with that baby
all night?

01:11.563 --> 01:13.330
You know he's still
struggling with that rash,

01:13.332 --> 01:15.665
But he'll be fine.

01:15.667 --> 01:19.419
We had a long
and wonderful conversation.

01:19.421 --> 01:20.871
Jacob scheduled the movers.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.222
That's a shame.

01:22.224 --> 01:24.274
I was looking forward
to watching him carry.

01:24.276 --> 01:26.359
All that furniture
we bought him across town,

01:26.361 --> 01:27.994
Piece by ill-gotten piece.

01:27.996 --> 01:31.748
When are you gonna tell him
who basie skanks really is?

01:31.750 --> 01:34.251
If you tell him,
he'll stay, james.

01:34.253 --> 01:36.169
I'm not even sure it's true.

01:36.171 --> 01:39.089
As I recall,
darrell had two daughters,

01:39.091 --> 01:40.323
And that was it.

01:40.325 --> 01:42.359
Do you remember any boys
in that family?

01:42.361 --> 01:43.643
No.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.861
But men have been known.

01:44.863 --> 01:47.164
To let their seed
fly on the wind,

01:47.166 --> 01:50.834
Desiring for fields
not their own.

01:50.836 --> 01:52.002
I'll talk to him about it.

01:52.004 --> 01:54.788
Thank you.

01:54.790 --> 01:56.590
But I won't beg him to stay.

01:56.592 --> 01:59.009
Far be it from me to ask you
to scuff your pride.

01:59.011 --> 02:00.143
In the name of something.

02:00.145 --> 02:02.963
As small and worthless as love.

02:02.965 --> 02:04.014
Come here. What?

02:04.016 --> 02:05.348
What?

02:07.953 --> 02:09.919
Baby.

02:09.922 --> 02:13.290
What?

02:13.292 --> 02:16.560
Hey!

02:16.562 --> 02:18.645
Where's that boy's father?

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.421 --> 02:43.703
It doesn't have to be a novel.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.989
Just try one sentence.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.807
"Hello, isaiah."

02:47.809 --> 02:50.627
Doesn't even have
to have a verb.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.062
And what if
he doesn't text back?

02:52.064 --> 02:55.982
Come on, sliding into the d.M.S
is a critical component.

02:55.984 --> 02:57.467
In 21st century dating.

02:57.469 --> 02:58.902
You've been staring
at his instagram.

02:58.904 --> 03:00.687
For 10 days now.

03:02.274 --> 03:03.473
No, wait, give it back!

03:03.475 --> 03:05.358
"Hey, isaiah.
It's your girl, sophia.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.677
Was wondering about
your relationship situation."

03:07.679 --> 03:08.778
Stop!

03:10.649 --> 03:12.115
I just don't want to
seem desperate.

03:12.117 --> 03:13.884
But you are.

03:13.886 --> 03:15.218
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

03:15.220 --> 03:20.140
You know, isaiah rehearses
every saturday at triumph.

03:20.142 --> 03:22.459
We could go.

03:22.461 --> 03:23.877
That wouldn't be weird?

03:23.879 --> 03:27.030
It would.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.766
How long you been here?

03:29.768 --> 03:32.385
I couldn't sleep.

03:32.387 --> 03:34.037
Go get ready for school.

03:35.374 --> 03:38.775
Do you want to be
bae goals 2017 or not?

03:38.777 --> 03:41.845
Closed mouths don't get fed.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.681
Hey, she's gonna miss me.
You know, when I'm gone?

03:44.683 --> 03:48.018
I'm not arguing with you.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.503
Isaiah hambrick?

03:50.505 --> 03:52.038
Eavesdropping's a sin, you know.

03:53.392 --> 03:56.559
Why didn't you come down?

03:56.561 --> 03:58.178
Because I wasn't
in the mood for another one.

03:58.180 --> 03:59.613
Of my father's paranoid

03:59.615 --> 04:01.414
"basie skanks is out
to get me" speeches.

04:01.416 --> 04:04.134
There you go.

04:04.136 --> 04:06.403
That being said,
I need to talk to basie.

04:06.405 --> 04:08.254
About that foolishness
he pulled last week.

04:08.256 --> 04:11.458
He should've told us
he was giving me that church.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.460
Definitely not making
my life any easier.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.529
Wait a minute, pastor.

04:17.531 --> 04:19.916
There you go.

04:20.986 --> 04:21.952
Yeah?

04:21.954 --> 04:23.086
Yeah.

04:25.424 --> 04:26.957
Okay.

04:26.959 --> 04:28.558
Can't wait to get out of here.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.860
Tasha's finally showing me
the parsonage this afternoon,

04:30.862 --> 04:32.996
So we could be out of here
as soon as next week.

04:33.465 --> 04:34.698
Mwah.

04:38.971 --> 04:41.037
Pastor greenleaf.

04:41.039 --> 04:42.172
Bishop's ring cleared, scoop.

04:42.174 --> 04:43.807
Story's over. No comment.

04:43.809 --> 04:45.291
I'm not here for the paper.

04:45.293 --> 04:47.527
That's a nice try.

04:47.529 --> 04:50.413
I thought you might want to go
on a post-scandal date.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.498
Yeah, to celebrate.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.783
You know, whoever told you
you were funny.

04:53.785 --> 04:55.285
Did the world
a great disservice.

04:55.287 --> 04:57.320
I'm serious.

04:57.322 --> 05:00.390
Look, I'll be off the clock.

05:00.392 --> 05:01.524
Is that really possible?

05:01.526 --> 05:04.995
I give you my word
as a christian.

05:04.997 --> 05:07.697
Mr. Nash, I'm flattered.

05:07.699 --> 05:09.165
No.

05:09.167 --> 05:13.269
Okay.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.221
If you change your mind.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.113
And it's darius.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.331
Good morning, pastor.
Morning, darlene.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.595
Have we heard back yet from
that girl at hallelujah 95.7?

05:38.597 --> 05:41.231
The one who finds you
so terribly transformative?

05:41.233 --> 05:42.365
I have, actually.

05:42.367 --> 05:44.751
And?

05:44.753 --> 05:46.436
She's having me
come in next week.

05:46.438 --> 05:48.104
To do an interview with mike o.

05:48.106 --> 05:49.906
Well, be sure
to give him my best.

05:49.908 --> 05:53.226
Outside of the lord,
mae, I assure you,

05:53.228 --> 05:54.778
You will be my main theme.

05:54.780 --> 05:57.080
You rang, mama?

05:57.082 --> 05:59.716
What is that thing?

05:59.718 --> 06:01.117
It's mama's way
of saying "come,".

06:01.119 --> 06:03.203
In lieu of a dog whistle
or a chain.

06:03.205 --> 06:05.722
It bestows a certain
poetry upon something.

06:05.724 --> 06:08.391
Which might otherwise
be merely mechanical.

06:08.393 --> 06:10.226
And it saves me from listening.

06:10.228 --> 06:12.662
To that interminable
voice message on her phone.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.030
What can I do for you, mama?

06:14.032 --> 06:16.766
We want you to fire carlton.

06:16.768 --> 06:19.719
Because betty wilcox has
an issue with gay marriage? No.

06:19.721 --> 06:22.205
No, this is about
more than betty wilcox.

06:22.207 --> 06:25.675
Over half the deacon board
haven't even pledged yet.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.844
And his brazenness
causes concern.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.062
For many of our other members.

06:29.064 --> 06:30.880
Says who? Betty wilcox?

06:30.882 --> 06:32.382
Says half the deacon board.

06:32.384 --> 06:34.134
Then they should
go somewhere else.

06:34.136 --> 06:35.969
Well, that's the problem...
They will.

06:35.971 --> 06:37.987
Are you okay with this?

06:37.989 --> 06:39.672
I can't lose half
the deacon board.

06:39.674 --> 06:41.374
Over a choir director.

06:41.376 --> 06:42.826
Wasn't he fired
from another church?

06:42.828 --> 06:44.394
Two churches. And he sued them.

06:44.396 --> 06:46.312
And he lost.

06:46.314 --> 06:47.597
I won't do it.

06:47.599 --> 06:48.631
Gigi...

06:48.633 --> 06:50.116
Who's gonna direct the choirs?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.035
I will not debate this with you.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.003
You are the associate pastor.

06:54.005 --> 06:56.906
Now, are you going to fire him,
or do I have to do it?

07:01.129 --> 07:04.564
I'll take care of it.

07:04.566 --> 07:06.316
And do it soon, please.

07:06.318 --> 07:07.917
Betty's leaving town
for new orleans.

07:07.919 --> 07:09.886
To see that granddaughter
that you baptized,

07:09.888 --> 07:11.287
And I don't want
her leaving here.

07:11.289 --> 07:12.922
Without writing us a check.

07:53.298 --> 07:56.166
<font color="#ffff00">Captions by vitac</font>...
<font color="#00ffff">www.Vitac.Com.</font>

07:56.168 --> 07:59.035
Captions paid for by
discovery communications.

08:36.274 --> 08:37.674
What'd you think?

08:37.676 --> 08:39.008
Sold.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.043
Thank you.

08:41.712 --> 08:43.279
What's good, pastor greenleaf?

08:43.280 --> 08:44.447
Yeah, so, just real quick...

08:44.449 --> 08:46.216
No, for you,
I got nothing but time.

08:46.218 --> 08:47.917
I met with the g.C., all right?

08:47.919 --> 08:49.936
They're gonna start digging
the foundation this week.

08:49.938 --> 08:51.387
I'm also putting together
a packet of.

08:51.389 --> 08:53.289
Potential worship team hires
for you to take a look at.

08:53.291 --> 08:55.391
Boy, you firing on all
cylinders, aren't you, pastor?

08:55.393 --> 08:56.576
I'm trying to, yeah.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.794
Yeah. I try to.

08:57.796 --> 09:00.363
Um, also wanted to say...

09:00.365 --> 09:01.864
In the future...

09:01.866 --> 09:04.133
Speak your heart. Bring it on.

09:04.135 --> 09:05.568
If you, - if you plan
on giving me big news.

09:05.570 --> 09:06.669
Like you did last week...

09:06.671 --> 09:09.272
I remember
the look on your face.

09:09.274 --> 09:11.841
You were like moses
on the mountaintop up there.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.210
"What?"

09:18.416 --> 09:19.616
Yeah, so, just, -

09:19.618 --> 09:21.351
Just kind of give me
a heads up from now on.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.586
Well, if god had
given me prior notice,

09:23.588 --> 09:25.855
I certainly would've
given it to you.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.324
So, you're gonna tell me.

09:28.326 --> 09:29.759
You didn't have
any plans to do that?

09:29.761 --> 09:30.893
What do you mean?

09:30.895 --> 09:32.095
The lord just gave it
to me to do, brother,

09:32.097 --> 09:34.397
Right then and there,
and I did it.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.299
I'm just finding that
a little hard to believe.

09:36.301 --> 09:37.734
Pastor greenleaf.

09:37.736 --> 09:39.669
Yeah?

09:39.671 --> 09:41.571
You languished in the shadow
of your father.

09:41.573 --> 09:44.040
Like some anemic little weed.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.375
In the space
of three short months,

09:45.377 --> 09:47.977
I have given you a church,
a place to live if you wanted,

09:47.979 --> 09:50.546
And access to your own soul
the way god made it to be.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.048
Before your daddy grabbed
ahold of it.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.785
And started stomping it flat
with his contempt.

09:55.787 --> 09:58.571
I've given you everything
you ever wanted.

09:58.573 --> 10:00.139
And I appreciate
everything you've done.

10:01.459 --> 10:03.159
Then don't accuse me of lying.

10:05.864 --> 10:08.131
I'm your brother.

10:08.133 --> 10:11.100
Got to trust me.

10:11.102 --> 10:13.236
Okay.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.237
Sorry.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.506
Okay, then.

10:16.508 --> 10:19.142
Boy, what I wouldn't
give to have a cigarette.

10:19.144 --> 10:21.411
Sometimes on a day like this.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.814
God says, "no, can't have that."

10:24.816 --> 10:25.999
I want you to go out
to southwind.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.350
This afternoon, door to door.

10:27.352 --> 10:30.069
Spread the word
about triumph two.

10:30.071 --> 10:32.121
I think most of the black folks
out there already go to calvary.

10:32.123 --> 10:33.256
I know.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.325
So, how happy would
they be to see you?

10:39.431 --> 10:42.098
What a blessing.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.469
Wow.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.870
That's all I meant.

11:20.872 --> 11:22.522
I love that.

11:22.524 --> 11:24.891
And with all the parts...
That's what I'm saying.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.809
Any time you can
get voices to weave in.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.429
And out like that,
pressing against each other,

11:29.431 --> 11:33.383
Sailing away,
coming back home again...

11:33.385 --> 11:37.186
That just puts a person
smack in the heart of god.

11:37.188 --> 11:39.005
That's how I see it, anyway.

11:40.892 --> 11:42.125
Did I say something wrong?

11:42.127 --> 11:43.126
No!

11:43.128 --> 11:44.761
No, that was beautiful.

11:47.799 --> 11:49.315
Hey.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.800
Sorry to interrupt.

11:50.802 --> 11:53.669
No. That's my sister, grace.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.571
Jabari is producing my album.

11:55.573 --> 11:57.540
Nice to meet you. Likewise.

11:57.542 --> 11:58.941
You got a second?

11:58.943 --> 12:00.543
Yeah.

12:08.153 --> 12:09.735
So, who will direct the choir?

12:09.737 --> 12:12.321
I guess mama assumes you.
Or wanda.

12:12.323 --> 12:15.158
Wanda's not a choir director,
and I just had a baby.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.794
I need more help now, not less.
This is so dumb!

12:17.796 --> 12:20.279
And immoral. No small thing.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.831
Well, no, I understand.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.749
Why people like betty think
what they think,

12:23.751 --> 12:25.768
But it's not very loving.

12:25.770 --> 12:27.303
But can't you
just talk to daddy?

12:27.305 --> 12:28.638
One little "but, daddy"
from gigi.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.006
Usually fixes
something like this.

12:30.008 --> 12:32.892
Daddy was sitting right there
when mama asked me to fire him.

12:32.894 --> 12:34.110
He's in.

12:34.112 --> 12:36.245
And I actually think
you are the only person.

12:36.247 --> 12:39.098
Who can stop this
from happening.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.851
Okay. I'll talk to her.

12:41.853 --> 12:43.202
I'm sorry to lay this on you.

12:43.204 --> 12:44.403
No, don't be.

12:44.405 --> 12:45.822
It's just one more thing.

12:45.824 --> 12:47.206
I'll handle it.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.625
Thank you.

12:49.627 --> 12:51.727
Gigi. Yeah?

12:51.729 --> 12:55.031
Thanks for including me.

12:55.033 --> 12:57.266
Of course.

12:57.268 --> 12:59.302
I have jeremiah, earl,

12:59.304 --> 13:02.505
J. Anthony, and rebecca
at the p.F.

13:02.507 --> 13:04.707
What about lionel?

13:04.709 --> 13:06.442
Well, he hasn't gotten
back to me about preaching,

13:06.444 --> 13:07.910
Let alone lodging.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.512
I'll call him myself.

13:09.514 --> 13:11.714
I don't feel good about
begging the man.

13:11.716 --> 13:13.115
Let it be.

13:13.117 --> 13:14.767
He just lost patrice, didn't he?

13:14.769 --> 13:17.503
Well, she didn't take his phone.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.472
With her to the grave
or his manners.

13:24.345 --> 13:27.663
Is that lionel?

13:27.665 --> 13:29.532
It's mac.

13:29.534 --> 13:31.234
Now, that's three times, now.

13:35.056 --> 13:37.440
What do you want, mac?

13:39.794 --> 13:42.628
You know, I couldn't care less.

13:42.630 --> 13:44.614
And listen, don't make me
change this number.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.883
Just don't call me again.

13:48.253 --> 13:50.269
What'd he want?

13:54.125 --> 13:55.925
Daddy's dying today.

13:58.062 --> 14:00.513
But that's according
to him, you know,

14:00.515 --> 14:02.532
And I never know anymore
whether he's making some excuse.

14:02.534 --> 14:04.967
Just to keep in contact
with me or do... you know?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.203
Are you sure you don't
want to go visit the man.

14:07.205 --> 14:08.638
And get things settled?

14:08.640 --> 14:10.706
He kept you out of jail,

14:10.708 --> 14:12.708
And that's settled
enough for me.

14:16.514 --> 14:17.980
Praise the lord!

14:17.982 --> 14:19.315
How you doing?
I'm pastor jacob greenleaf.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.117
Can I have a minute to talk
to you about triumph church?

14:21.119 --> 14:25.238
Gymnasium, pilates,
everything, man.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.207
And the bag and the mug
are yours to keep.

14:28.209 --> 14:29.292
What you doing here?

14:29.294 --> 14:32.261
Just, telling people
about triumph two.

14:32.263 --> 14:34.297
About the church that's
going up down the street?

14:34.299 --> 14:35.848
Yes, ma'am. That's the one.

14:35.850 --> 14:37.617
Does bishop know
you're here recruiting?

14:37.619 --> 14:39.185
I'm not recruiting.

14:39.187 --> 14:42.455
I'm, just letting folks know
there's an option.

14:42.457 --> 14:43.873
I'm giving out mugs.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.641
I don't need a mug.

14:45.643 --> 14:46.909
They're recyclable.

14:46.911 --> 14:48.978
I don't care if it came
from the winding cloth.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.047
That they wrapped my lord in
when he died.

14:51.049 --> 14:52.498
I'm with calvary.

14:55.420 --> 14:59.372
And you ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

15:03.111 --> 15:06.212
The lord is speaking to you
in all things,

15:06.214 --> 15:07.580
So in all things,

15:07.582 --> 15:11.050
Respond as if
you're responding to god.

15:13.304 --> 15:15.538
101.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.020
I think that's
a good tweet for today.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.559
Hey, mama. Got a minute?

15:19.561 --> 15:20.843
Yes, come on in.

15:20.845 --> 15:21.844
Hey! Hey.

15:21.846 --> 15:23.429
You know, I told corin.

15:23.431 --> 15:26.199
To stay on top of me
about this tweeting thing,

15:26.201 --> 15:27.683
And it is really paying off.

15:27.685 --> 15:29.685
How many followers do you have?

15:29.687 --> 15:31.637
70,000 and counting.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.072
Yeah.

15:33.074 --> 15:35.324
So, now I want you to ice
that cake with some hashtags...

15:35.326 --> 15:38.144
Hashtag obedience,
hashtag kindness.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.946
Already did it, all right?

15:39.948 --> 15:42.014
You see?

15:42.016 --> 15:43.182
Wow.

15:43.184 --> 15:46.719
Praise god we had the wisdom
to hire that girl.

15:46.721 --> 15:48.654
Especially these days.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.791
Mama, are you okay?

15:51.793 --> 15:55.761
Yes, I'm okay, baby.

15:55.763 --> 15:58.865
Grace told me the deacons
are trying to push carlton out.

15:58.867 --> 16:01.267
Nobody said any sort of thing.

16:01.269 --> 16:03.970
We are just trying to firm up
our financial base...

16:03.972 --> 16:05.688
Cut costs where we can.

16:05.690 --> 16:08.141
So, it has nothing to do
with carlton being gay?

16:09.911 --> 16:12.145
It is purely
a financial decision.

16:12.147 --> 16:15.114
Well, then, can we cut
something else?

16:15.116 --> 16:17.483
Well, I don't know. Let's see.

16:17.485 --> 16:20.486
Now, what about
this music producer,

16:20.488 --> 16:21.754
This jabari?

16:21.756 --> 16:24.974
Now, I think I saw a check
going out for $50,000.

16:24.976 --> 16:26.559
But it's less than
he usually charges.

16:26.561 --> 16:29.378
But it's more than
we usually spend.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.497
Kevin produced your last album.

16:31.499 --> 16:32.865
Why don't you just
let kevie do it?

16:32.867 --> 16:35.201
No, kevin's not
really a producer.

16:37.555 --> 16:39.605
What is going on
between you two?

16:39.607 --> 16:41.140
Your father is losing patience.

16:41.142 --> 16:42.842
With all this loose jell-o
kind of thing,

16:42.844 --> 16:44.744
And I can't say
that I blame him.

16:44.746 --> 16:49.081
Mama, I gave carlton my word
that this wouldn't happen.

16:49.083 --> 16:52.451
Just don't make a liar
out of me, please.

16:52.453 --> 16:56.155
This is not a discussion.

16:56.157 --> 16:58.391
And I apologize for anything.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.427
That led you to believe
that it was.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.099
Okay.

17:09.570 --> 17:14.123
Hey, "shawty," can I get them
trigonometry notes, or not?

17:15.226 --> 17:17.159
Lord have mercy.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.612
Isaiah just invited me
to his rehearsal.

17:19.614 --> 17:22.381
Let me see. Let me see.

17:22.383 --> 17:24.599
What do I do?

17:24.602 --> 17:27.136
I know they say there's no
such thing as dumb questions,

17:27.137 --> 17:29.939
But, girl.

17:29.941 --> 17:31.941
Will you come with me?

17:31.943 --> 17:34.393
No.

17:34.395 --> 17:37.096
I'm kidding. You know I got you.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.181
I got you, I got you!

17:39.183 --> 17:43.369
We know that if
our earthly house.

17:43.371 --> 17:48.074
Of this tabernacle
were to be absolved,

17:48.076 --> 17:51.244
We have a building of god.

17:51.246 --> 17:53.396
Not made with hands,

17:53.398 --> 17:55.932
Eternal in the universe.

17:55.934 --> 17:58.284
Amen.

18:01.389 --> 18:02.772
James?

18:02.774 --> 18:06.058
Yes, henry, it's me.

18:06.060 --> 18:09.028
I did what mae said.

18:09.030 --> 18:13.266
I know you did, and thank you.

18:14.269 --> 18:16.302
Henry...

18:16.304 --> 18:20.189
Did darrell james have a son?

18:20.191 --> 18:23.276
I remember the two little girls,
but I don't remember a boy.

18:23.278 --> 18:25.144
Mac?

18:29.901 --> 18:32.285
I was just leaving.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.658
You'll be in my prayers, henry.

18:42.797 --> 18:44.930
James... don't speak to me.

18:48.970 --> 18:52.505
The lord says
I have to forgive you,

18:52.507 --> 18:54.907
And one day I may.

18:57.178 --> 19:00.613
But I will never forget.

19:01.883 --> 19:05.751
I will leave you to deal
with your father.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.037
Until you have to
deal with ours.

19:15.179 --> 19:16.829
I don't want to die.

19:24.906 --> 19:28.641
I know.

19:28.643 --> 19:30.076
I know.

19:33.064 --> 19:35.798
It's gonna be okay.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.268
It's gonna be okay.

19:39.270 --> 19:42.838
It's gonna just like
when you threw me in coro lake.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.141
It's gonna be cold,

19:45.143 --> 19:49.978
It's gonna be scary,

19:49.980 --> 19:53.332
And then...

19:53.334 --> 19:57.853
you're gonna swim.

19:57.855 --> 20:01.807
You gonna swim all the way
across to Jesus...

20:05.380 --> 20:07.747
All the way home to the lord.

20:10.551 --> 20:12.618
You're gonna swim.

20:14.489 --> 20:17.857
Brother kevin. Darlene.

20:17.859 --> 20:19.125
How's lita?

20:19.127 --> 20:20.960
As well as can be expected.
Good, good.

20:20.962 --> 20:22.928
Listen, I've been meaning
to give this to you.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.197
It's a gift card for the baby
from both of us.

20:25.199 --> 20:27.867
Thank you.
You two must be tickled pink.

20:27.869 --> 20:30.503
I saw him roll by earlier.
So cute.

20:30.505 --> 20:31.637
Yeah,
we're feeling pretty blessed.

20:31.639 --> 20:32.905
And that rash is clearing up.

20:32.907 --> 20:35.524
Just like I told
charity it would.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.692
What rash is that?

20:36.694 --> 20:39.678
The one that's been
keeping him up.

20:39.680 --> 20:42.281
That rash.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.517
Yeah, he's doing
a lot better now.

20:44.519 --> 20:45.818
Well, thank you for this,

20:45.820 --> 20:46.919
And I probably should
get back to work.

20:46.921 --> 20:48.721
All right.
Well, congratulations again.

20:48.723 --> 20:51.140
Thank you.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.834
All righty. Here we are.

21:01.836 --> 21:03.068
Nice.

21:03.070 --> 21:04.670
Thank you.

21:04.672 --> 21:05.971
You're gonna love it.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.057
Come on. I got to show you.

21:09.777 --> 21:12.144
Come on!

21:12.146 --> 21:14.647
So, I actually used to
sell real estate.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.632
Before I joined basie
and the ministry.

21:16.634 --> 21:18.934
And I can tell you that
for this neighborhood,

21:18.936 --> 21:20.970
This is
a very attractive property.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.991
I can imagine it's
a little like, "what?"

21:25.993 --> 21:29.695
You know, but basie and I shared
a great five years here.

21:29.697 --> 21:32.097
And I know that once
you and jacob move in.

21:32.099 --> 21:33.782
And make it your own that
you're gonna love it.

21:33.784 --> 21:35.401
Just like we did.

21:35.403 --> 21:39.038
And I can help you
decorate, too, if you want.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.173
I did stage all the houses
when I was a realtor,

21:41.175 --> 21:44.026
So I've got a certified eye.

21:44.028 --> 21:46.145
That'd be great.

21:46.147 --> 21:48.314
Good. Come on in!

21:48.316 --> 21:49.648
Hey. Hey!

21:49.650 --> 21:51.600
So, what'd mama say?

21:51.602 --> 21:52.985
What do you think?

21:52.987 --> 21:55.387
No, and it's not
up for discussion.

21:55.389 --> 21:57.473
So, what are we gonna do?
There's nothing we can do.

21:57.475 --> 21:58.524
That's not true.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.892
We can both march
back up in her office.

21:59.894 --> 22:01.627
Gigi, I'm not about to do that.

22:03.130 --> 22:04.563
Charity, you promised him.

22:04.565 --> 22:06.448
If you want to make this
another one of your crusades,

22:06.450 --> 22:08.567
Then go ahead, but I can't.

22:08.569 --> 22:10.870
Honey, why?
Because I don't want to.

22:15.259 --> 22:17.510
I'm sorry.

22:38.866 --> 22:40.065
It's nash.

22:40.067 --> 22:43.536
Hey. It's grace greenleaf.

22:43.538 --> 22:45.454
Okay.

22:45.456 --> 22:48.474
This is happening an hour
before I expected it to.

22:48.476 --> 22:50.226
I don't want to go on a date.

22:50.228 --> 22:51.894
Fine.

22:51.896 --> 22:53.779
Slow day at church?

22:53.781 --> 22:55.798
Actually, I want to get together
and talk about something else,

22:55.800 --> 22:58.117
If that's okay.

22:58.119 --> 23:00.603
Is that okay?

23:00.605 --> 23:02.504
As long as I pick the place.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.391
Done.

23:08.345 --> 23:12.881
When I look back now
at the way I behaved,

23:12.883 --> 23:16.951
I feel like I'm looking at
a whole different person.

23:16.953 --> 23:19.754
I think you are.
That's the thing.

23:19.756 --> 23:22.991
Real transformation is the goal,

23:22.993 --> 23:24.926
And you achieved that.

23:24.928 --> 23:26.361
Congrats.

24:00.163 --> 24:02.430
What's up, ladies?

24:02.432 --> 24:04.899
Hey. I'm sophia.

24:04.901 --> 24:08.236
Thanks for coming out.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.470
You're pastor greenleaf's
daughter.

24:09.472 --> 24:11.856
He's sort of my dad, yes.

24:11.858 --> 24:13.291
We love your music.

24:13.293 --> 24:15.109
<i>She loves your music.</i>

24:15.111 --> 24:17.845
I think it's okay
to mildly great.

24:17.847 --> 24:20.398
Zora, right? Yep.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.550
Cool. I asked around about you.

24:22.552 --> 24:23.685
Hope that's okay.

24:23.687 --> 24:25.220
It's perfectly fine.

24:25.222 --> 24:27.488
I'm sort of a public figure.
I'm used to it, right?

24:28.792 --> 24:30.458
How do you like triumph?

24:30.460 --> 24:32.493
It's cool.

24:32.495 --> 24:35.880
The hook in that last song,
um, would that work?

24:37.901 --> 24:39.918
I mean, it worked. It worked.

24:42.239 --> 24:43.905
Cool.

24:43.907 --> 24:47.208
Kevin, how's it going
with your wife?

24:47.210 --> 24:48.610
Any chance I'm gonna
see her at a meeting.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.311
One of these nights?

24:50.313 --> 24:51.446
I don't know.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.914
She still got me
staying in a hotel.

24:52.916 --> 24:54.082
After nathan was born.

24:54.084 --> 24:55.850
And today, I found out
he had a rash.

24:55.852 --> 24:57.885
And she didn't even
tell me about it.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.120
I don't know what to do.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.882
Look, kevin,
I know from experience, brother,

25:01.423 --> 25:01.489
Blah.

25:01.690 --> 25:03.570
You probably feel like
you're the whole problem.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.293
To say the least.
But you're not,

25:05.295 --> 25:06.995
'cause you're coming
to these meetings.

25:06.997 --> 25:08.296
If your wife
isn't ready to do that,

25:08.298 --> 25:10.131
Well, that's her prerogative.

25:10.133 --> 25:12.233
This might be a situation.

25:12.235 --> 25:15.570
Where you need
to step up and lead.

25:15.572 --> 25:18.256
Be the man.

25:18.258 --> 25:20.258
It may be what
she's hoping you'll do.

25:28.051 --> 25:29.167
Is it okay?

25:29.169 --> 25:30.551
I mean, no, it's great,
it's good.

25:30.553 --> 25:31.586
Good.

25:31.588 --> 25:32.837
I didn't even know
this place was here.

25:32.839 --> 25:34.589
Yeah, it's an insider thing.

25:34.591 --> 25:36.691
But they let you in. Yeah.

25:36.693 --> 25:38.092
I'm sorry it's so loud.

25:38.094 --> 25:39.994
I didn't know
there'd be music tonight.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.363
Yeah, I don't believe you.

25:42.365 --> 25:45.099
Well, I... I thought
we could have some fun, too.

25:45.101 --> 25:48.202
I mean, we can go
somewhere else if you...

25:48.204 --> 25:50.104
No, no, this is good.

25:50.106 --> 25:53.675
We can talk later.

25:57.981 --> 25:59.080
You want to dance?

26:00.850 --> 26:02.050
No. Come on.

26:02.052 --> 26:03.518
Nobody here goes to church.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.952
I don't know. I'm telling you.

26:04.954 --> 26:07.121
Come on, come on. Yes, yes.

26:15.832 --> 26:18.232
Come on, come on!

26:41.958 --> 26:43.691
James?

26:43.693 --> 26:45.259
Wait a minute.

26:49.215 --> 26:50.598
James?

26:50.600 --> 26:51.632
Wha...

26:54.838 --> 26:56.204
Good evening, dear.

26:56.206 --> 26:58.039
Have you spoken to jacob yet?

27:00.560 --> 27:03.378
You said you were gonna do it.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.046
And... and I haven't,

27:05.048 --> 27:08.182
'cause I have the rather
hopeless feeling that...

27:08.184 --> 27:11.252
That he'll see
you actually want him leave.

27:11.254 --> 27:13.988
To put a fine point on it, yes.

27:13.990 --> 27:16.491
Why are you so hard on him?

27:16.493 --> 27:18.843
All he's ever done
is try to please you.

27:20.997 --> 27:23.331
May I be frank with you, mae?
I wish you would.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.338
Ever since gigi
started preaching,

27:30.340 --> 27:33.107
You have forced that boy into my
field of vision out of nothing,

27:33.109 --> 27:34.709
I believe, except jealousy
of your own daughter.

27:34.711 --> 27:36.944
Jealousy?
Ascribing to him a call.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.279
And a variety of talents.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.814
He never showed
any evidence of having.

27:39.816 --> 27:41.032
And gigi does?

27:41.034 --> 27:43.351
She did.

27:43.353 --> 27:45.119
Until we broke her spirit.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.804
And she ran off and left us.

27:46.806 --> 27:48.222
Please.

27:48.224 --> 27:53.227
I'm sorry if
I've misdirected my anger.

27:53.229 --> 27:55.046
About all this to him,

27:55.048 --> 27:57.265
But he seems to have drank
the kool-aid you brewed.

27:57.267 --> 28:02.520
And between the two of you,
I'm about to lose my mind.

28:02.522 --> 28:03.721
Let him go.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.840
Jacob deserves to know
the truth about basie.

28:05.842 --> 28:08.042
Before he's subject
to his authority.

28:10.246 --> 28:12.997
Or do you not even love
your son enough to do that?

28:31.460 --> 28:32.409
Hey.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.978
From darlene.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.613
You couldn't
give me this tomorrow?

28:36.615 --> 28:39.216
Why didn't you tell me
about nathan's rash?

28:39.218 --> 28:40.934
Well, it wasn't a big deal.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.269
He's my son, too.

28:42.271 --> 28:44.221
I know he's your son.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.722
I didn't think you'd
freak out about it.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.825
I'm not freaking out.
I'm just saying.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.326
For the past three months,
I'm trying to make things right,

28:49.328 --> 28:50.794
And it feels like
I'm still being punished.

28:50.796 --> 28:53.630
You're not the only
one who feels punished.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.399
But I'm the only one
that's trying.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.425
You should've told me
about the rash.

29:05.427 --> 29:07.211
You're right.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.646
I'm sorry.

29:12.635 --> 29:15.552
No, no.

29:15.554 --> 29:16.837
Let me. I got him.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.757
Okay.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.001
My brother used
to always give me.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.803
So much heat
about my two left feet.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.554
Well, there was no
evidence of them tonight.

29:34.556 --> 29:36.490
When we were growing up,
my parents only let us.

29:36.492 --> 29:39.660
Listen to secular music
on saturday night.

29:39.662 --> 29:41.812
But jacob had this
boom box in his room,

29:41.814 --> 29:44.231
So we would have dance wars...
Me, him, charity, and faith.

29:44.233 --> 29:45.782
Who'd win? Jacob.

29:45.784 --> 29:46.917
It was his boom box,

29:46.919 --> 29:48.318
And he always picked
everybody's songs.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.820
That doesn't sound fair to me.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.688
Yeah.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.774
Not much is, is it?

29:53.776 --> 29:56.743
What did you want to talk about?

29:56.745 --> 29:58.595
Nothing.

30:00.733 --> 30:03.167
Didn't sound like that earlier.

30:03.169 --> 30:04.885
Off the record?

30:04.887 --> 30:06.336
Promise.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.056
My parents are making me
fire our choir director.

30:09.058 --> 30:10.841
Why are they letting him go?
Because he's gay,

30:10.843 --> 30:13.393
And some folks at the church
have a problem with it.

30:13.395 --> 30:15.245
And I guess he was fired
from a couple of churches.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.047
Before that for the same reason.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.916
Kind of makes you wonder
why he keeps trying, doesn't it?

30:18.918 --> 30:20.551
No, I get that.

30:20.553 --> 30:22.469
You know, there's something
you get in church.

30:22.471 --> 30:25.455
That you don't get
anywhere else.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.991
You said you're a christian?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.059
I am.

30:29.061 --> 30:31.762
Do you go to church?

30:31.764 --> 30:32.963
No.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.898
I didn't think so.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.700
But I do know
what you're saying. I do.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.151
I mean, I miss some things.

30:39.505 --> 30:42.573
And then, there's some things
I do not miss at all.

30:44.710 --> 30:47.244
So, what are you gonna do?

30:47.246 --> 30:48.545
I'm gonna do it.

30:48.547 --> 30:51.798
If I don't do it,
somebody else will do it.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.817
And I'd rather it come from me.

31:02.628 --> 31:05.913
I got to go. I'm sorry.
It's my daughter.

31:05.915 --> 31:08.198
Thank you for everything.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.634
It's my pleasure.

31:16.859 --> 31:19.009
Am I gonna see you again?

31:19.011 --> 31:22.079
Well, I hope so.

31:27.653 --> 31:30.487
You were driving the corolla.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.873
That was what, our third date?

31:35.044 --> 31:37.761
The night I met your family.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.696
I remember.
The bishop was giving me.

31:39.698 --> 31:43.233
Some mini-sermon
about godly restraint.

31:44.519 --> 31:47.037
And lady mae wanted
my entire family genealogy.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.206
Especially
after she saw that car.

31:50.292 --> 31:51.375
Do you remember how I broke down.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.409
Right when
we were trying to leave?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.878
Right at the front gate.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.313
And me and jacob
were under the hood.

31:56.315 --> 31:57.564
Trying to get it to start again,

31:57.566 --> 31:58.732
And you sitting
in the front seat.

31:58.734 --> 32:00.384
With your legs crossed
like a princess.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.836
Well, there was
nothing else I could do.

32:06.558 --> 32:10.327
Our little man's gonna get tired
of hearing those stories.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.429
Maybe you should stay the night.

32:12.431 --> 32:15.432
You can wake up with him.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.402
You sure?

32:18.404 --> 32:21.204
Yeah.

32:21.206 --> 32:23.156
I'd like that.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.042
Okay.

32:27.212 --> 32:29.413
Jacob?

32:29.415 --> 32:31.181
Yes, sir.

32:31.183 --> 32:34.384
You eating standing up
like a horse?

32:34.386 --> 32:36.586
There's another half there
on the plate.

32:36.588 --> 32:39.956
I could throw some texas pete
on there, the way you like it.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.792
It's too late
for that texas pete,

32:41.794 --> 32:45.078
At least for this old man.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.730
How's the new job working out?

32:46.732 --> 32:50.283
It's great.
Things are going well.

32:50.285 --> 32:51.968
Why?

32:51.970 --> 32:54.321
I know you're not gonna believe
what I've got to say.

32:54.323 --> 32:55.305
Wait, yeah, pop...

32:55.307 --> 32:56.606
You're not gonna let me finish?

32:56.608 --> 32:58.342
Please, just don't.

32:58.344 --> 33:01.695
I don't want to hear any more
about your conspiracy theories.

33:01.697 --> 33:03.513
About you and basie skanks.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.182
My life's not about you, pop.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.417
It's about me.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.987
Test test test test test test.

33:11.255 --> 33:11.355
Wy.

33:11.422 --> 33:12.422
T

33:13.709 --> 33:16.026
I know. And what do you want?

33:16.028 --> 33:18.028
When do you give a damn
about what I think?

33:18.030 --> 33:21.865
You don't want me there,
you don't want me here.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.133
What do you want?

33:23.135 --> 33:24.568
What am I supposed to do?

33:28.357 --> 33:30.841
Basie skanks might
not be perfect.

33:30.843 --> 33:34.111
He might be boo boo the fool.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.979
At least he's not
a false prophet.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.968
Bishop find you?

33:57.970 --> 34:00.937
Yeah, he found me.

34:00.939 --> 34:03.373
What happened?

34:05.544 --> 34:08.277
I've done everything
he's asked...

34:08.280 --> 34:13.650
Loyal, worked hard,
put my time in,

34:13.652 --> 34:16.969
Worshipped the ground
that man walked on.

34:16.972 --> 34:20.190
All he ever had
to do was just...

34:20.192 --> 34:23.092
Was just say, "good job, son."

34:23.094 --> 34:25.728
I mean, hey, maybe,

34:25.731 --> 34:28.632
"I couldn't have done it
without you."

34:28.634 --> 34:29.933
Instead, what I get?

34:29.935 --> 34:32.502
"Gigi would have done it better.
You're not called.

34:32.504 --> 34:35.205
I wasn't quite feeling
the word today, jacob."

34:40.512 --> 34:42.913
He doesn't respect me.

34:42.915 --> 34:45.498
He doesn't respect me
as an ordained pastor,

34:45.501 --> 34:49.186
As his son, as a man.

34:53.225 --> 34:56.827
I respect you.

34:56.829 --> 34:59.279
I know you don't
like that place,

34:59.281 --> 35:01.414
But we're getting out of here.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.608
Good morning, lady mae.
Good morning.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.711
You wanted to see me?
Yes, um, sit over there.

35:15.713 --> 35:16.929
Thank you.

35:20.251 --> 35:22.852
Carlton, let me start by saying.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.137
What a wonderful addition.

35:25.139 --> 35:28.958
Your ministry of music
has been here at calvary.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.760
Thank you.
And I want you to know.

35:30.762 --> 35:33.846
That if you ever need
a personal reference from me...

35:33.848 --> 35:36.398
That's what this is.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.117
I'm afraid so.

35:38.119 --> 35:40.386
I'm sure you know
that we've been.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.437
Going through
some financial issues.

35:42.439 --> 35:44.757
That we couldn't have
foreseen last year.

35:44.759 --> 35:47.810
And so we've had
to look hard for cuts.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.829
And unfortunately,
the music ministry.

35:49.831 --> 35:51.680
Is one of those areas.

35:51.682 --> 35:53.115
That is unfortunate.

35:53.117 --> 35:56.285
And since you were the last
person hired in the department,

35:56.287 --> 35:58.954
Well, you know the rest.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.539
I do, actually.

36:00.541 --> 36:03.425
Quite well.

36:03.427 --> 36:05.678
May I ask you a question?

36:05.680 --> 36:08.247
Of course.

36:08.249 --> 36:11.016
Do you think
gay marriage is wrong?

36:11.018 --> 36:13.486
Because you knew I was gay
when charity hired me,

36:13.488 --> 36:16.555
So all this has got to be about
reggie and I getting married.

36:18.943 --> 36:21.360
I believe what the bible says
about marriage.

36:21.362 --> 36:24.096
And sexual immorality.

36:24.098 --> 36:26.549
But what about
what it says about love,

36:26.551 --> 36:28.517
Or not sitting in the seat
of the scornful,

36:28.519 --> 36:29.819
Or being in judgement?

36:29.821 --> 36:31.704
Listen.

36:31.706 --> 36:34.256
Because I believe
what the bible says.

36:34.258 --> 36:36.292
Doesn't mean I don't love you.

36:36.294 --> 36:40.062
It doesn't mean that I am
sitting in judgement of you.

36:40.064 --> 36:43.849
This is purely
a financial decision.

36:45.786 --> 36:47.586
For the record,

36:47.588 --> 36:51.406
I don't believe you.

36:51.408 --> 36:53.425
But I love you,

36:53.427 --> 36:56.962
And I will pray
for the broken part in you.

36:56.964 --> 37:00.516
That has to believe that there
is a broken part in me.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.387
Thank you.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.016
You're here.

37:17.018 --> 37:18.934
Mama, I'm gonna fire him today.

37:18.936 --> 37:20.519
I just did.

37:20.521 --> 37:23.022
Your father's dallying
I have to be patient with.

37:23.024 --> 37:26.475
Yours? No.

37:26.477 --> 37:28.994
Life's too short.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.150
Really?

37:51.152 --> 37:52.902
You know you not
cooking that chicken this time.

37:52.904 --> 37:55.070
Hey, reggie.

37:55.072 --> 37:56.855
Pastor.

37:56.857 --> 37:59.074
That's a nice car.

37:59.076 --> 38:01.860
What can we do for you, pastor?

38:01.862 --> 38:04.914
Can we talk?

38:04.916 --> 38:06.348
Whatever you have to say,

38:06.350 --> 38:09.484
You can say in front of him.

38:09.486 --> 38:11.003
Look, I'm just sick about this.

38:11.005 --> 38:12.154
Yeah, well, how do you think
we feel?

38:12.156 --> 38:13.339
Hey, baby... no, shorty...

38:13.341 --> 38:15.374
It's all right.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.793
We knew we were taking
a risk getting married.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.178
Been in the church
my whole life.

38:19.180 --> 38:20.829
I know my people.

38:20.831 --> 38:22.681
They love you all week, as long
as they can shove you back.

38:22.683 --> 38:24.717
In that closet
come sunday morning.

38:27.705 --> 38:31.056
Don't worry. I'm not gonna sue.

38:31.058 --> 38:32.841
But will you keep
coming to church?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.897
The only way to work on
the church is to be in it.

38:43.454 --> 38:44.486
Call you later, mama.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.071
Don't leave like this.

38:46.073 --> 38:47.072
I hear you.

38:47.074 --> 38:49.008
This is a mistake.

38:49.010 --> 38:51.693
He's still your father.

38:51.695 --> 38:53.379
Gigi. Bro.

38:53.381 --> 38:55.047
It's like in the hood,

38:55.049 --> 38:56.565
But not the...
Not the hood-hood.

38:56.567 --> 38:59.034
I guess my school commute
will be shorter or something.

38:59.036 --> 39:00.669
Facetime me so I can see it.

39:00.671 --> 39:01.720
Okay.

39:01.722 --> 39:03.555
Come on, kids. Let's go.

39:03.557 --> 39:05.891
See you, sweetie.

39:05.893 --> 39:08.710
I love this little...
You smell so good.

39:48.686 --> 39:51.003
I got betty wilcox's
pledge check.

39:52.606 --> 39:54.873
Congratulations.

40:43.724 --> 40:44.990
What's going on? Off the record?

40:44.992 --> 40:47.176
Off the record.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.343
Are you gonna tell her
the truth?

40:48.345 --> 40:49.578
About what?

40:49.580 --> 40:53.365
Why we made her wait so long
to visit her grandson.

40:53.367 --> 40:56.201
God has placed his
goliath in our path, david.

40:56.203 --> 40:57.753
Have you got the stones?

40:57.755 --> 41:01.006
Son, you're being used.

41:01.008 --> 41:02.791
One of my uncle's victims
tried to killer herself.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.143
Why isn't he in jail?

41:04.145 --> 41:06.345
The fact
that he's out there free...

41:08.082 --> 41:09.281
Weighs on me.

41:11.685 --> 41:14.186
