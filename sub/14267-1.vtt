♫ There are places I remember ♫

00:19.644 --> 00:24.189
♫ All my life Though some have changed ♫

00:24.274 --> 00:28.777
♫ Some forever Not for better ♫

00:28.862 --> 00:33.574
♫ Some have gone And some remain ♫

00:33.658 --> 00:38.537
♫ All these places Had their moments ♫

00:38.580 --> 00:43.042
♫ With lovers and friends
I still can recall ♫

00:43.084 --> 00:47.629
♫ Some are dead And some are living ♫

01:43.728 --> 01:47.940
will transform the salient
misdeeds of bloodthirsty mobs

01:48.024 --> 01:51.693
into the calculated good
deeds of orderly citizens.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.947
I know there are temptations

01:54.989 --> 01:56.865
to turn to physical violence.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.828
I know the temptations that we all face.

02:00.912 --> 02:04.123
But let me urge you as we
go on in the days ahead

02:04.165 --> 02:06.959
to recognize that we have a power

02:07.001 --> 02:09.794
greater than guns, greater than ammunition

02:09.838 --> 02:13.298
greater than hand grenades,
we have a power.

03:08.146 --> 03:14.193
Hello, Heinz. Long time no see.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.534
Ha. I was in prison.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.869
We know.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.704
And now you're out.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.373
Yeah.

03:28.458 --> 03:33.253
Just out.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.714
How much for the pie?

03:35.757 --> 03:37.341
One dollar.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.229
How much is it now?

03:50.271 --> 03:53.815
Now?

03:53.900 --> 03:55.359
Now it's nothing.

05:19.986 --> 05:20.986
Drop me.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.330
Wow. Am I not wonderful?

05:36.336 --> 05:37.669
What is youse doin' now?

05:37.712 --> 05:39.921
Glue.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.507
You've just done pills.

05:42.592 --> 05:47.095
Those downs were garbage.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.016
Melanie, Melanie, why don't
you sit up here with me, huh?

05:51.100 --> 05:55.562
Hey, now, don't mess up my thoughts, Sal.
This is hard.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.817
Okay, that's it.

06:11.662 --> 06:16.750
I'm flyin', man. I'm flyin'
from my friggin' feet!

06:24.342 --> 06:26.468
What a pair of freakin' debutantes.

06:26.552 --> 06:31.556
Melanie, you know. Come here, honey.
Come here.

06:31.599 --> 06:36.603
You got glue all over your friggin' beak.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.314
All right, you wanna fly? You wanna fly?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.149
I can fly too, all right?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.609
Let's fly.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.739
I'm flyin', man.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.494
It is not as it should be.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.287
It's beautiful.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.832
There's too much space between the letters.

06:56.916 --> 07:02.087
My eyes cannot see it together as one word.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.005
So, I took two of 'em.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.341
It was like 11 o'clock
and nothin' happened.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.510
Hey, you wanna couple of broads?

07:08.594 --> 07:10.679
Que pasa, my friend?

07:10.763 --> 07:12.431
I wanna know if you wanna take

07:12.515 --> 07:14.182
a couple a broads off my hands?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.434
What's wrong with 'em?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.102
Look at 'em. They're
ripped outta their gourds.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.271
I'm sick a lookin' at 'em
in my rear view mirror.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.856
I want them out of the car. Capisce?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.357
You want them or not?

07:22.442 --> 07:25.444
I can't feel my arms...

07:25.486 --> 07:26.945
What is he saying?

07:26.988 --> 07:29.030
He wants us to take these girls.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.200
Really? That's marvelous. Isn't it?

07:32.285 --> 07:34.286
Five dollars.

07:34.328 --> 07:35.954
Five bucks what?

07:35.997 --> 07:37.873
Five dollars and we'll take the girls.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.624
Look, I'm telling yah, these downs

07:39.709 --> 07:42.335
these downs were the most serious kind of-

07:42.420 --> 07:45.046
Okay. Here.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.381
Kind of garbage I ever had.

07:46.466 --> 07:50.177
They're all yours. Go. Bye.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.728
Who are you?

07:59.812 --> 08:01.396
Castro.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.815
Where's your beard?

08:07.737 --> 08:08.987
You live around here?

08:09.071 --> 08:10.822
Yeah, I live around here.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.574
I live all around here.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.092
Where are they now?

08:32.178 --> 08:34.011
Murray, wait a minute, wait a minute.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.764
Where is it? What happened?

08:35.847 --> 08:37.182
Oh, no.

08:37.265 --> 08:37.849
Our sign.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.352
I know, come on. Let's
just take the stuff in.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.604
It's you who wanted the sign.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.688
Save the sign.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.273
You wanted to spend money on a sign.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.442
It's all right, don't worry
about it. Don't worry about it.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.235
Look-look-

08:48.319 --> 08:50.529
I know, I know. It's just a pumpkin.
They had some fun!

08:59.789 --> 09:01.373
What are you staring at?

09:01.457 --> 09:03.057
So, forgive me, I just caught a flash of

09:03.084 --> 09:04.459
why you kissed me off.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.211
Yeah, who asked ya?

09:06.254 --> 09:08.588
What'd you think? You think I don't think?

09:08.673 --> 09:10.757
I know what's going on here. I
know exactly what's going on here.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.592
You don't know nothin'.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.385
That's the one I want.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.052
No, it ain't.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.471
Heinz is back. I just saw him.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.847
Oh, he is?

09:17.932 --> 09:19.057
You're trying to protect me?

09:19.141 --> 09:20.350
No, I ain't.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.114
When it's me who should be protecting you.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.104
Yeah, like the last time?

09:30.236 --> 09:33.113
This fish is a female fish.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.824
So I don't want this one. I want that one.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.993
Take the freakin' fish and
get off my back, okay?

09:38.077 --> 09:39.828
Go pay my father at the register.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.496
All right.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.123
Dad, I'm gonna take some lunch.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.666
You hold down the fort, okay?

09:44.750 --> 09:45.750
Okay then.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.669
James.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.504
James! Look-

09:49.589 --> 09:51.339
you're gonna have to excuse me.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.091
I know I ain't going about
this the ideal way-

09:53.175 --> 09:54.718
but, like, Heinz tried to rape me

09:54.802 --> 09:58.847
you tried to stop him and now you limp.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.308
So what?

10:01.392 --> 10:03.768
So Heinz is back and I
gotta get some protection.

10:03.853 --> 10:04.853
I'll protect you.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.354
You can't.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.231
What, are you gonna go to the police?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.357
They ain't gonna help you.
He ain't done nothin'.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.484
No, I ain't gonna go to the
cops. I'm gonna go to Harry.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.445
Harry?

10:13.529 --> 10:15.488
Yeah. That's who stopped him the last time.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.990
But don't you know what Harry's
been doing? That was then.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.783
He ain't gonna help you with this.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.660
We'll see about that.

10:20.745 --> 10:21.995
Ain't you heard?

10:22.079 --> 10:24.331
Harry's nonviolent now!

10:27.043 --> 10:29.127
Who will support the fight
for democracy around the world.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.962
Vote for the man who believes extremism

10:31.047 --> 10:33.131
in the pursuit of liberty is no vice.

10:33.174 --> 10:37.344
Moderation in the pursuit
of freedom is no virtue.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.849
♫ Don't stand in the doorway,
Don't block up the hall ♫

10:42.933 --> 10:47.812
♫ For he that gets hurt
Will be he who Has stalled ♫

10:47.897 --> 10:52.025
♫ The battle outside raging ♫

10:52.109 --> 10:54.194
♫ Will soon shake Your windows ♫

10:56.572 --> 10:58.740
♫ For the times, They are a-changin' ♫

10:58.824 --> 11:01.409
Harry?

11:01.494 --> 11:02.952
Yeah, Ma?

11:03.037 --> 11:06.581
You promised you'd walk the Buddha.

11:06.666 --> 11:11.252
♫ Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land ♫

11:11.337 --> 11:14.381
Come on... come on out, baby. Come on.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.260
He won't cooperate with me.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.265
I don't really haven't
that much time, Ma-Mother.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.598
I'm supposed to be meeting
the guy-the gentleman

11:23.683 --> 11:26.726
from SNCC in Harlem this afternoon.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.604
Excuse me, Harry, who belongs to this dog?

11:29.689 --> 11:30.480
It's my dog.

11:30.564 --> 11:34.567
That's right. The Buddha belongs to you.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.903
I cannot walk the Buddha.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.822
I cannot do anything with the Buddha

11:38.906 --> 11:40.699
that the Buddha does not want me to do.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.784
Okay, I'll walk him.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.077
Come here, Buddha boy.

12:27.913 --> 12:32.083
Hey, Brita.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.251
Brita!

12:36.756 --> 12:37.839
Brita.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.758
Oh, I got a headache.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.261
Where are we?

12:43.304 --> 12:47.474
I don't know. This ain't my house.

12:49.268 --> 12:53.271
This ain't my house either.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.940
Well, whose house is this?

12:55.983 --> 12:57.817
What did we do last night?

12:57.902 --> 12:59.444
You were with Sal.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.696
This ain't Sal's house.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.950
Wait a minute.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.161
There were some guys.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.330
Yeah?

13:10.414 --> 13:12.165
Yeah.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.962
I ain't wearing no clothes.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.470
I ain't wearing no clothes neither.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.976
M rs. Fitzgerald.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.728
Yeah?

13:33.813 --> 13:37.398
Hi. Uh, I'm Linda Komkowski. Is Harry in?

13:37.483 --> 13:40.151
No, I'm sorry, he's not.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.403
He'll be right back.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.822
Do you want to come in and wait for him?

13:43.864 --> 13:45.198
Sure, yeah.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.783
Come on.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.792
Hello, Heinz.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.961
Fuck you.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.297
So they let you out.

14:42.381 --> 14:46.092
I don't let no hair grow over to
hide this scar you gave me, Harry.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.052
You should. You look like shit.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.471
I don't wanna forget!

14:50.556 --> 14:53.600
What? That some goon hit you
over the head with a beer pitcher?

14:53.684 --> 14:55.810
It don't seem like no golden memory to me.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.896
Why don't you forget it?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.773
I'm trying to forget it.
I'm not proud of it.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.818
I had a lot of time to think
when I was in that fucking hole.

15:03.903 --> 15:08.072
Yeah, well, it's a shame you didn't use it.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.826
Yeah, well-

15:14.079 --> 15:16.331
why don't you go walk your dog?

15:16.415 --> 15:20.084
Leave me to smoke my cigarette.

15:20.127 --> 15:24.672
Look, Heinz, I-

15:24.757 --> 15:26.674
I wanna say something to you.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.597
I love you.

15:35.851 --> 15:38.269
I did a lotta soul searching
while you were gone

15:38.312 --> 15:41.147
I've had a lot of bad shit happen.

15:41.231 --> 15:44.609
And I don't wanna do that
caveman stuff no more.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.110
I wanna help people.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.536
You love me?

15:55.621 --> 15:56.621
Yeah.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.979
It's funny how things are, you know.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.272
How things are set up.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.358
You're the first girl ever
to come here asking for Harry

16:25.442 --> 16:28.736
and he's out walking the dog.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.530
You know him from Fordham?

16:30.614 --> 16:33.157
No, no, from the neighborhood.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.703
It's funny. I figured he'd go to school

16:36.787 --> 16:40.748
meet some girl and get married.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.834
And here he graduated in june

16:42.876 --> 16:45.086
and he's still as single
as he ever was. Right?

16:45.170 --> 16:47.380
Right.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.007
Well, I guess so. It's...

16:51.510 --> 16:55.179
He got so serious after his father died.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.057
His father was a hero cop.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.685
You get to be a hero cop by being killed.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.604
Yeah. I know about that.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.231
Why don't you sit down?

17:12.823 --> 17:16.117
You with the student
nonviolent Negro thing?

17:16.201 --> 17:17.952
No.

17:18.037 --> 17:22.457
Harry's got it in his
head to be a hero, too.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.960
Harry's gonna go down to M ississippi

17:26.045 --> 17:30.048
him and a buncha other heroes.

17:30.090 --> 17:36.971
Register Negroes for the vote.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.432
Those hillbilly cops down there

17:39.516 --> 17:41.642
with their third-grade
educations and their shotguns

17:41.727 --> 17:43.936
and their love of the Negro people-

17:44.021 --> 17:46.814
they're gonna welcome
Harry the hero, my son

17:46.899 --> 17:50.068
make him feel at home.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.611
Maybe I should go.

17:51.695 --> 17:54.739
I'm sorry.

17:54.782 --> 17:58.910
He's packing his bag.
It was just on my mind.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.661
Why do you wanna see Harry?

18:04.124 --> 18:06.709
Who's that?

18:11.256 --> 18:11.798
Can I help you-

18:11.882 --> 18:13.716
Excuse me. Excuse me, Mrs. Fitzgerald

18:13.801 --> 18:15.510
but Linda's here, right?

18:15.594 --> 18:17.261
James, what are you doing here?

18:17.346 --> 18:20.306
I just figured it out. You
got a thing for this guy.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.433
This number about protection,
that's just smoke.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.268
You're throwing me over
so's you can make a play

18:24.353 --> 18:25.353
for Harry Fitzgerald.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.646
Uh, your son.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.189
Excuse me, M rs. Fitzgerald

18:28.273 --> 18:28.981
but I'm in love with this girl.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.316
She's pulling a number on me.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.943
I figured it out, Linda. Tell me I'm wrong.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.027
You're wrong.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.113
Bull-hockey.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.405
Maybe you don't understand what's going on.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.530
Shall I explain it to you?

18:37.574 --> 18:38.783
I wish you would.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.284
This one here is my girl.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.869
Last night she breaks up with me.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.704
I feel bad. You could understand that.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.248
Sure.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.372
And she don't tell me why.

18:46.416 --> 18:50.128
So today I'm eatin' my heart out
- when I see Heinz.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.879
Heinz?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.631
Hei - uh, bad boy from way back.
He busted my hip.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.475
He tried to rape Linda,
et cetera, et cetera.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.135
Harry saved the situation.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.679
Iced Heinz completely
with a pitcher of beer.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.014
So, now she tells me she's
breaking up with me

19:02.099 --> 19:03.724
on account of Heinz being back.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.184
You said that.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.936
Ah, you didn't contradict me.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.896
And that she's going to
Harry for protection.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.690
Now the whole world knows that Harry's

19:10.774 --> 19:12.316
out to lunch with this Gandhi thing.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.860
Would you like some coffee?

19:13.944 --> 19:15.528
No, I think a cup of coffee right now

19:15.612 --> 19:17.446
would give me a heart attack. Thank you.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.131
So when I got a minute to think about it

19:19.199 --> 19:21.868
I'm thinking it definitely don't add up.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.203
And then, bam, I understand!

19:24.288 --> 19:28.541
It must be like she got
obsessed for Harry Fitzgerald

19:28.625 --> 19:32.712
and that she's using Heinz
for smoke to blow on me.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.922
Oh, james, please.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.507
But what else could it be?

19:36.592 --> 19:37.216
Would you like to sit down?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.886
I can't sit down M rs.
Fitzgerald. I'm a man on the move.

19:39.970 --> 19:44.265
Sit down!

19:48.687 --> 19:50.438
What's this?

19:50.522 --> 19:54.650
This? This is your life, clown.

20:04.953 --> 20:08.539
Bud, hey, come and see
me inside in 20 minutes.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.216
Good morning, Maxine.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.717
Good morning.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.135
Busy day, huh?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.641
Why don't you wait a little
while, will ya? They'll turn up.

20:26.725 --> 20:29.018
But neither of their own
mothers ain't heard from them.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.812
Well, why ain't their own mothers down
here complaining about it then, huh?

20:31.897 --> 20:34.398
Because they got a shitty attitude.
Like you.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.609
Oh, yeah? Well why don't you
take a lesson from them

20:36.693 --> 20:38.236
and just don't worry about it.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.862
How's it going, Phil?

20:39.947 --> 20:41.489
Good, Sully. What'd it look like?

20:41.573 --> 20:44.242
Homicide.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.244
Look, you gotta help me find
these chicks, all right?

20:46.286 --> 20:47.870
I feel responsible for them.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.830
Well, go! Go and find 'em. Go with God.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.791
Just leave me alone, will
ya, for cryin' out loud?

20:51.875 --> 20:53.334
Thirty-third Precinct.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.843
So, it was really an arrow?

21:02.928 --> 21:05.179
Yeah. Right in the back.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.014
What do you make of that?

21:07.099 --> 21:09.767
I ndians. What happened there?
Somebody tag you?

21:09.810 --> 21:12.270
No, it's a pimple.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.855
You know there used to
be Indians around here.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.024
Is that right?

21:17.109 --> 21:22.113
Sure. This whole area here was I
ndians. It was called Keskeekek.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.281
Is that right?

21:23.365 --> 21:24.532
Sure.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.616
Well, what happened?

21:25.701 --> 21:27.326
What do you mean?

21:27.411 --> 21:29.704
Why ain't they here now?

21:29.788 --> 21:31.998
The neighborhood changed.

21:39.381 --> 21:44.844
So who killed this-what was he?

21:44.928 --> 21:50.641
Algebra teacher. I don't know.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.561
Heinz Sabatino's back on
the street, you know.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.230
Yeah, I know.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.357
Think it might be him?

21:58.442 --> 22:02.903
Maybe, but where did he learn
the art of the bow and arrow?

22:02.988 --> 22:07.033
He could've picked it up in the pen.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.784
Who from?

22:08.869 --> 22:13.998
An I ndian. A camp counselor. I don't know.

22:14.041 --> 22:19.378
So, uh, we moved in and
the I ndians moved out.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.422
That's right, the I ndians moved out

22:21.506 --> 22:24.842
and a Dutch couple moved in.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.385
Who were they?

22:26.470 --> 22:28.387
They were the Bronx.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.057
Something like John and Katrina Bronc.

22:31.141 --> 22:36.103
People used to say, "Let's go over
and visit the Broncs tonight."

22:36.188 --> 22:38.856
Boy, this is weird.

22:38.899 --> 22:45.112
This is, like, the weirdest
thing that's ever happened to me.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.031
It's them.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.783
Who? The guys from last night?

22:48.867 --> 22:51.952
Hi, Brita. You get some good sleep?

22:52.037 --> 22:57.041
He knows my name. And
he's French or something.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.959
German.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.128
German, huh?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.755
Is that your apartment?

23:02.839 --> 23:04.882
No, not exactly.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.093
This is an apartment
over which we have use.

23:07.177 --> 23:10.096
Until the superintendent finds out!

23:10.180 --> 23:12.056
Listen, somebody murdered our teacher

23:12.140 --> 23:13.391
so we got the day off.

23:13.475 --> 23:18.104
You wanna go for a ride?

23:18.188 --> 23:23.567
A ride?

23:23.652 --> 23:24.735
All right.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.887
Tweet, tweet, tweet. Tweet.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.681
Tweet, tweet.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.447
Someone there?

24:11.032 --> 24:12.450
Is someone there?

24:12.534 --> 24:13.868
It's me.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.412
Heinz? Is that you?

24:20.292 --> 24:21.500
Yeah.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.502
I can't believe it's you!

24:51.490 --> 24:52.907
God, I hate that.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.034
I do play it a little loud

24:55.118 --> 24:57.244
but it's so beautiful. It
makes me feel so good.

24:59.831 --> 25:03.167
I got your letters all
the time you was gone.

25:03.251 --> 25:04.919
I didn't write.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.462
Oh, I know you did.

25:06.546 --> 25:07.963
Maybe I didn't get 'em all the time

25:08.048 --> 25:09.757
but I know you wrote your mother.

25:09.841 --> 25:10.883
How's the asthma?

25:13.845 --> 25:16.931
I ain't had asthma since I was twelve.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.766
Yeah, you've been gone a long time.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.769
Ooh, what a weird haircut.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.814
I'm sure it's the style now.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.777
This what I have they call
Corinthian Curls. Ya like it?

25:31.780 --> 25:34.698
I wanna change my clothes.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.200
My clothes still here?

25:36.243 --> 25:37.243
Yeah.

25:43.166 --> 25:47.586
I want
- I wanna change my clothes.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.296
Where's the bathroom?

25:49.381 --> 25:50.589
Okey doke.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.954
Look, you don't even know
he's gonna bother you.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.914
When I talked to him today, it was like-

26:23.999 --> 26:26.166
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You talked to Heinz?

26:26.251 --> 26:29.336
Yeah. And I told him I loved him.

26:29.421 --> 26:33.257
You told Heinz Sabatino you loved him?

26:33.341 --> 26:36.594
Yeah, I did.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.305
This is who you're going to for protection?

26:39.389 --> 26:41.265
I'm sorry, Linda.

26:41.349 --> 26:42.829
I gotta have a chuckle over this one.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.852
This guy's further out than Sputnik.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.813
Look, when you want my help,
you know where to find me.

26:47.897 --> 26:50.858
Harry, all the best in Mississippi.

26:50.942 --> 26:54.653
It ain't worth it being jealous with you.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.197
You're a wacko and you're leaving town.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.991
It ain't worth it.

26:59.075 --> 27:03.829
This is not a rival. This is a phenomenon.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.002
You gotta excuse him.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.129
He's just... he's just kinda nervous

27:12.213 --> 27:13.505
about himself, you know?

27:13.590 --> 27:15.883
It's okay.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.218
You saved him too, right?

27:18.303 --> 27:23.390
I guess that makes him feel kinda weird.

27:23.475 --> 27:27.728
He limps around and I, I
guess he don't feel like a

27:27.812 --> 27:30.564
you know, like enough
of a man or something.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.833
Hi, Ed.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.502
What do you say?

27:51.544 --> 27:54.088
Good afternoon, Esther.

27:54.172 --> 27:57.549
Hi, Jimmy.

27:57.634 --> 27:58.676
Quiet all day?

27:58.718 --> 28:00.761
So far.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.012
Ha, how's he doing?

28:02.097 --> 28:03.806
One more, it's a knock.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.522
What you drinking, Esther?

28:11.564 --> 28:13.524
Nothing.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.359
What was in that glass?

28:15.443 --> 28:19.363
Hmmm... let's see.

28:19.447 --> 28:24.118
No-that one.

28:24.202 --> 28:27.246
Uh, excuse me, Jimmy. I'm
lookin' for Melanie.

28:27.330 --> 28:30.374
Maybe you seen her?

28:30.417 --> 28:32.876
No.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.294
Nothing?

28:34.379 --> 28:36.588
Look, I just got on.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.340
All right. Thanks.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.556
I understand, you got things you gotta do.

28:45.598 --> 28:48.267
I'm just scared is all.

28:48.351 --> 28:51.645
I guess that's my problem, though, right?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.564
You probably won't even hear from the guy.

28:53.648 --> 28:55.566
All that junk was a long time ago.

28:55.608 --> 28:58.986
But what if I do hear from him?

28:59.070 --> 29:01.655
All right, if you hear from him, call me.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.449
Thanks.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.951
Listen, uh, I'm probably
only gonna be around

29:06.035 --> 29:07.578
a couple more days

29:07.662 --> 29:10.330
and then you're strictly on your own.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.499
He probably won't bother you.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.463
All right, take it easy.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.179
She left the bag open for like two hours.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.663
The glue was like a frigging' rock.

29:26.681 --> 29:27.514
What a shame.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.766
Okay.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.434
Okay what?

29:30.518 --> 29:31.518
Whatnot Willie?

29:31.561 --> 29:32.936
Whatnot.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.605
This is a whatnot.

29:34.647 --> 29:36.190
What's it for?

29:36.274 --> 29:38.150
Watch. We're on the tenth floor, right?

29:38.234 --> 29:39.777
Right.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.654
So I push nine and
- can you hold this?

29:42.739 --> 29:43.989
This?

29:44.073 --> 29:45.949
Yeah. And-

29:50.789 --> 29:52.039
I put this here.

29:58.671 --> 30:01.131
Come on. This is the ride I promised you.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.674
This one is for us.

30:02.759 --> 30:04.802
Oh there?

30:04.844 --> 30:06.136
Come on. It's a goof.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.186
After you.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.152
Come on. Don't be afraid.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.159
Sit down.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.673
So, what do we do now?

30:42.715 --> 30:44.341
Now we wait.

30:48.972 --> 30:52.099
Oh. They're gone.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.434
They'll be back.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.733
Melanie, dig this. It's like outer space!

31:01.818 --> 31:04.486
Yeah, it's like that down here too.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.579
Hi!

31:57.707 --> 31:58.749
Bye!

32:52.679 --> 32:54.388
What you want, dear?

32:54.472 --> 32:56.181
He don't want nothin', Nancy.

32:56.265 --> 32:58.141
He's just crazy, right?

32:58.184 --> 33:00.227
I'm meeting a couple friends.

33:00.311 --> 33:05.190
Shoot. Ain't nobody got no
friends in here, Sonny.

33:05.274 --> 33:07.651
Hey, gimme a dollar-

33:07.694 --> 33:11.363
I may be able to get you outta here alive.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.658
Hello, Arthur.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.159
Hello, Brother Harold.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.245
Sit down.

33:18.329 --> 33:21.081
We haven't met, have we, uh-?

33:21.165 --> 33:23.834
You're not sure?

33:23.918 --> 33:27.671
Um, I'm Harry Fitzgerald.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.257
This is Brother Samuel Kemp.

33:30.341 --> 33:33.844
He's been down in Mississippi
for us for a long time now.

33:33.886 --> 33:36.930
He's been working with
Brother Stokely Carmichael.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.182
Can I get you something?

33:39.267 --> 33:47.107
Yeah, I'll have coffee, too. Black.

33:47.191 --> 33:51.278
The purpose of the M
ississippi Project is to, uh

33:51.362 --> 33:53.697
get rich white kids working down there

33:53.781 --> 33:56.616
beside those of us Negroes
who've been beaten up enough

33:56.701 --> 33:59.411
to satisfy a lifetime in
the cause of The Movement

33:59.495 --> 34:02.581
without the population up
North getting upset about it.

34:02.665 --> 34:05.959
Now, we figure if we can
get these rich white kids

34:06.044 --> 34:09.087
to get beat up in the cause of The Movement

34:09.172 --> 34:11.965
that'll get the TV cameras
rolling real good.

34:12.050 --> 34:17.262
Here you go.

34:17.346 --> 34:19.056
Thank you.

34:19.098 --> 34:23.393
I, uh, I want you to like me, M r. Kemp.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.900
I don't like you.

34:30.985 --> 34:35.655
I don't like the idea of you.

34:35.739 --> 34:40.327
What I mean is I want you to,
uh, approve me for this project.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.954
I want to be on that bus-

34:43.039 --> 34:45.081
the day after tomorrow.

34:45.123 --> 34:48.251
Why should I approve you?

34:48.293 --> 34:52.339
Why should Brother Arthur here approve you?

34:52.422 --> 34:54.466
Look at you.

34:54.550 --> 34:57.427
You look to me like you're
made out of sweet butter

34:57.470 --> 35:00.347
and when that Mississippi sun lands on you

35:00.431 --> 35:03.016
you're gonna melt down
to nothing but grease.

35:03.101 --> 35:07.270
They got State Troopers down
there waiting for you, uh

35:07.355 --> 35:11.024
Harvard types with a knife and fork.

35:11.109 --> 35:15.362
Now, why don't you go home?

35:18.407 --> 35:21.034
I can understand if you
don't like me, M r. Kemp.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.871
I can. I, uh

35:24.956 --> 35:28.708
I might not like you.

35:28.793 --> 35:32.045
I don't know. Yet.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.966
But lemme set you straight
on a couple things.

35:36.050 --> 35:38.635
I'm not rich.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.512
I didn't go to Harvard.

35:40.596 --> 35:43.306
I went to Fordham, which ain't Harvard.

35:43.349 --> 35:47.894
And I come from a place in
the Bronx called Five Corners.

35:47.979 --> 35:52.357
Now, The Movement has, has
not been to this place.

35:52.441 --> 35:56.153
If a Negro, if you, for instance

35:56.195 --> 35:59.531
were to walk through Five Corners

35:59.615 --> 36:01.158
before you'd gone one block

36:01.242 --> 36:02.701
people would come outta their houses

36:02.785 --> 36:05.537
and stomp your ass into the ground.

36:05.621 --> 36:08.832
Now, two years ago, I woulda
been one of those people

36:08.916 --> 36:11.084
but something happened-

36:11.169 --> 36:15.422
And.. I.. I had a change of heart.

36:15.506 --> 36:19.092
You see, my, uh-

36:21.512 --> 36:23.722
my father was killed, my father was shot.

36:23.806 --> 36:27.726
He was, he was a cop and
he was shot by some kid

36:27.810 --> 36:31.897
some crazy kid, and, uh

36:31.981 --> 36:34.524
when I was sitting home with my mother

36:34.567 --> 36:38.445
watching the news about it on TV

36:38.529 --> 36:40.530
the next thing they showed after that

36:40.615 --> 36:42.782
was Dr. Martin Luther King speaking.

36:42.867 --> 36:48.622
And he was talking about the power of love

36:48.706 --> 36:52.626
in the face of senseless
cruelty and violence.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.045
I heard him, Mr. Kemp.

36:55.087 --> 36:59.049
I guess something knocked
the wax outta my ears

36:59.133 --> 37:03.470
'cause I heard him loud and clear.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.472
And that's why I am sitting here now.

37:10.645 --> 37:14.064
Was this, uh-

37:14.148 --> 37:19.611
kid who killed your father black?

37:19.695 --> 37:21.404
You know, I don't remember.

37:24.742 --> 37:25.492
Hey!

37:25.576 --> 37:26.576
Hey, you two!

37:26.577 --> 37:27.410
What's up?

37:27.495 --> 37:29.913
Hey. Come over on this one.
We'll all be on one.

37:29.956 --> 37:30.997
Yeah!

37:31.082 --> 37:32.582
All right.

37:35.086 --> 37:35.669
Come on, Melanie.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.587
Oh, no.

37:37.672 --> 37:38.672
I ain't walkin' around in here.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.674
Don't be a chicken-ass,
Melanie. It's like the sidewalk.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.634
Come on.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.554
Come on.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.815
Oh, shit.

37:56.899 --> 37:59.818
Uh, hurry up. Come down now. Come down.

37:59.902 --> 38:02.862
Just step down. Go on hurry.
Quickly. Go on.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.949
Come on, Melanie, just jump down. come on.

38:05.992 --> 38:07.784
Come on now-you just step down. Come on.

38:07.868 --> 38:10.912
All right. All right. All right.
All right. Jesus.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.168
That's it.

38:17.253 --> 38:18.044
All right.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.714
That's it.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.132
All right, Melanie.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.805
Come on.

38:28.848 --> 38:31.850
Come on. That's it.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.018
Just a little more.

38:35.771 --> 38:37.814
Oh my God!

38:37.898 --> 38:39.316
Oh my God.

38:39.358 --> 38:40.483
What a disaster...

38:46.991 --> 38:52.329
Oh, man.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.039
Shit.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.593
I think I'm gonna throw up.

39:06.677 --> 39:08.511
No! Don't, don't throw up!

39:08.554 --> 39:10.263
Help me down!

39:10.348 --> 39:13.266
Oh, my God.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.524
Oh my God, I am horribly sorry
for having offended Thee

39:21.609 --> 39:23.443
and I detest all my sins because I dread

39:23.527 --> 39:25.528
the loss of heaven and the pain of hell.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.120
Let go.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.789
I ain't lettin' go.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.374
Hurry up before it moves!

39:37.458 --> 39:40.293
Hey, Melanie, just jump, man. Fuck it!

39:40.378 --> 39:42.212
Why don't you jump off something

39:42.296 --> 39:44.589
if you're so freakin' hot to jump?

39:44.673 --> 39:48.635
Melanie, I'll give you
five dollars if you jump.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.304
I know where you got that five dollars!

39:51.389 --> 39:53.098
So I'm offering it to you.

39:53.182 --> 39:57.102
You can take it and shove
it up the guy's nose.

40:02.274 --> 40:03.900
Well, are you just gonna stand there

40:03.943 --> 40:11.943
or are you gonna help me down?

40:12.284 --> 40:14.244
I got you.

40:15.454 --> 40:17.664
I'm saved.

40:17.748 --> 40:18.998
Wonderful.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.917
It's moving.

40:21.001 --> 40:23.294
Oh, I think I broke a nail.

40:35.015 --> 40:37.267
He said that the Democrats would enforce

40:37.309 --> 40:39.853
the recently enacted
civil rights laws which

40:39.937 --> 40:43.690
were initiated by Kennedy
and his martyred brother.

40:43.774 --> 40:46.192
Johnson, quoted from the Oval Office

40:46.277 --> 40:48.611
declared that Senator Goldwater's policies

40:48.696 --> 40:53.867
would lead the U.S. into a
hopeless land war in Southeast Asia.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.702
In Neshoba County, Mississippi

40:55.786 --> 40:57.495
the bodies of three civil rights workers-

41:41.916 --> 41:43.208
Hello?

41:43.292 --> 41:46.211
Hello, Linda?

41:46.295 --> 41:48.046
Hi, Heinz.

41:48.130 --> 41:50.757
Did you know I was back?

41:50.841 --> 41:53.593
Uh-yeah, yeah I did.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.263
Oh you did, huh?

41:57.348 --> 42:00.934
Listen, listen, I got you a present.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.936
Uh, guess what it is.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.395
I don't know. What?

42:04.480 --> 42:05.855
I said guess.

42:05.940 --> 42:08.107
Uh-flowers?

42:08.192 --> 42:11.236
No.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.530
You're wrong.

42:13.572 --> 42:16.032
Listen, listen, I want you to meet me

42:16.116 --> 42:19.285
at twelve o'clock at the Oval Fountain.

42:19.370 --> 42:23.957
No, I don't meet nobody
at midnight nowhere.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.625
You'll meet me.

42:25.709 --> 42:26.709
Or what?

42:26.752 --> 42:28.795
You'll meet me

42:28.879 --> 42:30.755
because if you don't meet me-

42:34.218 --> 42:36.427
I don't know, something might happen.

42:36.512 --> 42:40.723
How's your friend, uh, what's his name?

42:40.766 --> 42:43.726
I ain't even going out with him anymore.
We broke up.

42:43.811 --> 42:49.274
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you
won't mind if I pay him a visit.

42:49.358 --> 42:51.651
All right. I'll meet you.

42:51.735 --> 42:52.777
Don't be late.

42:52.861 --> 42:54.070
Yeah, I'll be there.

42:54.154 --> 42:55.321
Goodbye, Linda.

42:59.118 --> 43:01.244
Last few weeks of uncertainty

43:01.328 --> 43:04.497
has ended in the knowledge
of the murder of our son

43:04.582 --> 43:06.833
Andrew Goodman...

43:06.917 --> 43:10.503
and his companions james
Chaney and Michael Schwerner.

43:10.588 --> 43:15.425
Hope, slim though it was, has passed away

43:15.467 --> 43:18.595
and a painful certainty has come.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.932
Our grief, though personal

43:23.017 --> 43:25.435
Hello, Harry?

43:25.477 --> 43:29.439
Um, oh, I guess Harry's
not there then, huh?

43:29.523 --> 43:31.608
Who is this?

43:31.692 --> 43:33.818
It's Linda. Do you know
when Harry'll be home?

43:33.902 --> 43:35.820
I don't know when he'll be back.

43:35.904 --> 43:37.822
Well, could you just tell
him that I gotta meet Heinz

43:37.906 --> 43:40.658
at the Oval by the fountain at 12 o'clock?

43:40.743 --> 43:42.785
And I'd-I'd feel a heck of a lot better

43:42.828 --> 43:44.871
if Harry was there too.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.372
Will you tell him that?

43:46.457 --> 43:47.790
All right, I'll tell him.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.251
Okay. Um, goodnight.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.801
People who might go to Mississippi

43:58.844 --> 44:02.472
they will go because many believe

44:02.514 --> 44:05.475
and I have received hundreds
of letters from young people

44:05.559 --> 44:08.895
all over the country
expressing this belief.

44:08.979 --> 44:11.898
And if they go, if they choose

44:11.982 --> 44:15.693
to fight for equality along
with the other young people there

44:15.778 --> 44:17.320
they have my heart

44:17.404 --> 44:18.821
and they have my strength-

44:32.211 --> 44:33.378
Trick or treat.

44:33.462 --> 44:37.423
Harry? Where you been?

44:37.508 --> 44:40.051
Been out walking.

44:40.135 --> 44:42.845
You want a drink?

44:42.930 --> 44:45.181
Come on.

44:45.224 --> 44:46.349
All right.

44:52.606 --> 44:54.190
Guess it didn't go so well, huh?

44:54.233 --> 44:58.528
Why you say that?

44:58.570 --> 45:02.198
'Cause you haven't said yes
to a drink in about a century.

45:02.241 --> 45:03.783
Well, you're right.

45:03.867 --> 45:06.536
It didn't go great. Went okay.

45:14.211 --> 45:15.586
Where's the Buddha?

45:15.671 --> 45:17.588
I got him locked in the kitchen.

45:17.673 --> 45:20.550
Ma, why'd you lock him in the kitchen?

45:20.634 --> 45:22.434
You're lucky I didn't
send him out after you.

45:22.469 --> 45:24.262
I told you not to lock him in the kitchen.

45:24.346 --> 45:26.472
Harry, you've been gone eight hours.

45:26.557 --> 45:29.142
I've been gone six and a half hours.

45:29.226 --> 45:31.310
All right, six and a half hours.

45:31.395 --> 45:34.480
Six and a half hours is a
very long time in Harlem.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.818
Mother, you worry too much.

45:38.902 --> 45:40.486
You know what happened today?

45:40.571 --> 45:42.155
No, what happened?

45:42.239 --> 45:44.157
You know those three kids in M ississippi?

45:44.241 --> 45:46.117
Yeah, Goodman, Chaney and
Schwerner, what about 'em?

45:46.201 --> 45:49.328
They're dead.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.122
I know they're dead, Ma.

45:51.206 --> 45:52.498
What do you mean, you know they're dead?

45:52.583 --> 45:54.292
Their parents just found out.

45:54.376 --> 45:57.086
Everybody knows they've
been dead for weeks.

45:57.129 --> 45:59.338
What do you mean, everybody?

46:32.122 --> 46:37.835
I woulda gotten a strike, but
without my thumbnail, I'm no good.

46:37.920 --> 46:42.048
Listen, did we do anything last night?

46:42.132 --> 46:43.800
Whaddaya mean?

46:43.842 --> 46:47.804
I mean I woke up with no clothes on.

46:47.888 --> 46:50.348
No, I didn't do anything.

46:53.727 --> 46:54.727
Good.

46:58.315 --> 47:00.066
Excuse me.

47:00.150 --> 47:02.652
Where the hell you been?

47:02.694 --> 47:05.071
I've been through three
friggin' neighborhoods

47:05.155 --> 47:05.822
lookin' for you.

47:05.906 --> 47:08.991
Where you been? You been all
your time with these guys?

47:09.076 --> 47:10.243
Where have I been?

47:10.327 --> 47:12.328
Yeah.

47:12.412 --> 47:15.665
Excuse me if I don't feel like
explainin' that to you, Sal.

47:15.707 --> 47:20.711
I got a five-dollar bill that
you gave these guys, ya big shot!

47:20.796 --> 47:22.004
What?

47:22.089 --> 47:26.175
What! What! Don't gimme that "what" shit.

47:26.260 --> 47:30.930
Oh, boy. Your mother is like insane.

47:31.014 --> 47:32.265
She don't know where you are.

47:32.349 --> 47:33.850
She's sittin' by the phone,
staring at the phone

47:33.934 --> 47:35.560
like it was a crystal ball
or some shit, Melanie

47:35.644 --> 47:37.353
but it don't ring, 'cause you don't call.

47:37.437 --> 47:38.563
Shut up about my mother!

47:38.647 --> 47:41.107
Don't you mention my
frigging' mother to me.

47:41.191 --> 47:42.900
They're engaged.

47:42.985 --> 47:47.530
You'd swear ta God they
was already married.

47:47.614 --> 47:49.740
Where'd you sleep last night?

47:49.825 --> 47:52.577
That's none of your goddamn business!

47:52.661 --> 47:55.454
Thank you.

47:55.539 --> 47:58.124
I'm engaged, too.

47:58.208 --> 47:59.959
Really?

48:00.043 --> 48:02.086
Yeah.

48:02.170 --> 48:04.463
To her brother, Ronny. He's in the Navy.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.382
Well, you never wanna do nothin'.

48:06.466 --> 48:07.300
Whaddaya mean, I don't wanna do nothing?

48:07.384 --> 48:10.553
Oh, are you gonna give the guy some money?

48:10.637 --> 48:17.226
Oh, oh, I gotta pay this guy's date.
Oh, that is rich.

48:17.269 --> 48:19.270
That guy's like takin' me dancin' tonight.

48:19.354 --> 48:21.480
We'll see about that

48:21.565 --> 48:24.108
'cuz I think you got a few
things to apologize about.

48:24.192 --> 48:26.193
Come on.

48:26.278 --> 48:28.738
I gotta apologize to you? For
selling me for five dollars?

48:28.822 --> 48:30.740
I'm worth 25!

49:03.231 --> 49:04.565
Hi, Heinz.

49:20.499 --> 49:26.671
How you been, huh?

49:26.755 --> 49:29.131
I've missed you.

49:29.174 --> 49:31.717
You did, huh?

49:31.802 --> 49:32.969
Yeah.

49:33.053 --> 49:36.389
Outta the whole world

49:36.473 --> 49:38.391
you were the only one I missed.

49:38.475 --> 49:42.144
Thanks. That's nice.

49:42.187 --> 49:44.563
I brought you a present.

49:44.648 --> 49:47.149
Yeah?

49:47.234 --> 49:48.901
Turn your back.

49:51.363 --> 49:52.905
Why?

49:52.990 --> 49:54.907
'Cause it's a surprise!

49:54.992 --> 49:58.452
Okay.

50:05.752 --> 50:08.170
Don't turn around until I say.

50:08.255 --> 50:09.547
I won't.

50:17.514 --> 50:21.267
I really tried to think
of somethin' you'd like.

50:21.351 --> 50:25.021
Thanks, that's nice.

50:25.105 --> 50:29.066
'Cause I want you to like me.

50:29.151 --> 50:31.569
I like you, Heinz.

50:56.762 --> 50:59.972
Okay. You can turn around now.

51:06.730 --> 51:08.606
I don't see nothing.

51:08.690 --> 51:14.236
'Cause you're not lookin'
in the right place.

51:14.321 --> 51:15.696
Look in the water!

51:33.465 --> 51:36.675
Huh, they're so cute!

51:36.760 --> 51:41.097
I wanted to get you a present.

51:41.139 --> 51:44.433
I tried to think a
somethin' that you'd like.

51:44.476 --> 51:47.812
They're unbelievable. Where'd you get 'em?

51:47.896 --> 51:51.357
From the zoo.

51:51.441 --> 51:53.275
You stole 'em outta the Bronx Zoo?

51:53.318 --> 51:57.113
Yeah. I climbed over the fence with a bag.

51:57.197 --> 51:59.782
It was easy. No, you know, no big thing.

51:59.825 --> 52:01.450
They keep 'em outside.

52:01.535 --> 52:03.327
You gotta take 'em back, you know.

52:03.411 --> 52:05.204
What?

52:05.288 --> 52:08.207
Otherwise they'll die.
They need special stuff.

52:08.291 --> 52:10.292
They're a present.

52:10.335 --> 52:12.878
Yeah, I know, but serious
now, you gotta take 'em back.

52:12.963 --> 52:16.048
I thought you'd like 'em,
'cause you like animals.

52:16.133 --> 52:18.300
I do like 'em, but that a...
that ain't the point.

52:18.385 --> 52:20.010
But, then you take 'em, then.

52:20.095 --> 52:23.013
I can't, Heinz. I mean, it won't be right.

52:23.098 --> 52:25.641
They're like
- they're like wild things, you know

52:25.684 --> 52:27.643
they, they ain't like dogs or some shit.

52:27.686 --> 52:31.355
They belong in a zoo. In a zoo, right?

52:31.439 --> 52:37.403
You know?

52:37.487 --> 52:39.572
You don't want my present?

52:39.656 --> 52:41.615
No.

53:03.972 --> 53:05.139
God.

53:21.198 --> 53:25.201
It's all right.

53:25.243 --> 53:27.703
It's all-it's all right.

53:30.540 --> 53:33.250
It's just that when somebody
gives you a present

53:33.335 --> 53:36.921
you should take it, that's all.

53:37.005 --> 53:38.923
It's all right.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.636
There's another one over there.

53:43.720 --> 53:47.932
I'll give you that one...

53:48.016 --> 53:51.477
and this time you'll take it, right?

53:52.604 --> 53:53.687
All right.

54:06.451 --> 54:07.451
Come here.

54:27.806 --> 54:31.850
Now, here's your present, Linda.

54:31.935 --> 54:33.143
Take it.

54:38.233 --> 54:39.942
What do you say?

54:39.985 --> 54:41.277
Thank you.

54:41.319 --> 54:45.114
You're welcome.

54:45.156 --> 54:48.492
Are you gonna give me something?

54:48.576 --> 54:52.037
Whaddaya want?

54:52.122 --> 54:53.872
A thankâ€you kiss.

55:02.632 --> 55:04.967
That's good. That's good.

55:05.051 --> 55:07.136
I better be gettin' home. I...

55:07.178 --> 55:08.721
Oh no, no, not yet.

55:08.805 --> 55:10.097
Yeah. I gotta get home. My-

55:10.181 --> 55:11.974
my father ain't feelin' good.

55:12.058 --> 55:13.642
And I've got-I gotta take
care of your present.

55:13.685 --> 55:15.894
I gotta fix him up with water and stuff.

55:15.979 --> 55:21.233
All right-gimme, uh, gimme another kiss.

55:45.675 --> 55:49.386
Gin.

55:49.471 --> 55:52.514
I'm going to bed.

55:52.557 --> 55:54.475
If you want another
drink, make it yourself.

55:54.559 --> 55:56.852
No, I gotta get up early.
Arthur's calling me tomorrow.

55:56.895 --> 55:58.520
Arthur the Negro?

55:58.605 --> 56:00.856
Yeah, Ma, Arthur the Negro's gonna call me

56:00.940 --> 56:02.858
and gimme the verdict whether I go or not.

56:02.901 --> 56:05.194
Not that it didn't seem
pretty clear, like I said.

56:05.278 --> 56:07.363
Speaking of calls, you got a call.

56:07.405 --> 56:09.198
I did. Who?

56:09.282 --> 56:10.616
That girl, what's her
name-she was here today?

56:10.700 --> 56:13.369
Linda called? What'd she say?

56:13.411 --> 56:17.081
Oh, you know-something like this afternoon.

56:17.165 --> 56:18.374
You already said no.

56:18.458 --> 56:21.293
Be more specific, please.

56:21.378 --> 56:23.879
Don't play the cop with me, sonny boy.

56:23.963 --> 56:25.881
What did she say?

56:25.924 --> 56:29.385
She hadda meet Heinz somewhere
and she was scared.

56:29.469 --> 56:30.969
Where?

56:31.054 --> 56:34.765
The Oval, at the fountain at midnight.

56:34.849 --> 56:37.101
Why didn't you tell me?

56:37.185 --> 56:39.478
You already said no.

56:39.562 --> 56:40.896
Why didn't you tell me?

56:40.939 --> 56:43.816
Figure it out!

56:43.900 --> 56:47.069
You're so determined to kill
yourself, one way or the other.

56:47.112 --> 56:49.071
If they won't let you go to M ississippi

56:49.155 --> 56:52.157
then you'll go out and lock
horns with some nutcase here!

56:52.242 --> 56:54.410
You're just like your goddamn father

56:54.452 --> 56:57.830
Lord have mercy on his dumbass hero soul!

56:57.914 --> 56:59.081
I'm going to bed!

56:59.124 --> 57:00.207
I'm going out.

57:00.291 --> 57:01.291
Take the Buddha.

57:01.334 --> 57:02.793
What?

57:02.877 --> 57:04.169
Take the Buddha. He needs the walk.

57:04.254 --> 57:05.838
Christ Almighty!

57:05.922 --> 57:07.047
Buddha!

57:09.926 --> 57:12.052
Bye.

57:27.110 --> 57:28.193
It's open.

57:32.991 --> 57:35.784
You gotta help me do something.

57:35.827 --> 57:36.827
Come on.

58:04.647 --> 58:07.816
I wanna leave this penguin with you, james.

58:07.901 --> 58:08.901
Oh, no.

58:08.985 --> 58:11.695
Yeah. You gotta take care
of this penguin for me.

58:11.779 --> 58:13.238
Why don't you
- why don't you take him to your shop?

58:13.323 --> 58:14.823
You've got the cages and everything.

58:14.908 --> 58:16.241
I can't go back there.

58:16.326 --> 58:18.827
Heinz could be waiting for me.

58:18.870 --> 58:20.913
I don't know, why, why don't
you go to the police?

58:20.997 --> 58:22.414
Police? What's that gotta do?

58:22.499 --> 58:24.249
Why, 'cause he murdered a penguin?

58:24.334 --> 58:25.751
How much time you think
he's gonna get for that?

58:25.835 --> 58:27.753
Oh, I gotta get some sleep.

58:27.837 --> 58:29.838
I could go stay at my Aunt Pam's house.

58:29.881 --> 58:31.757
Oh, she don't give a
shit if I stay out late.

58:31.841 --> 58:33.675
We could figure about all this tomorrow.

58:33.718 --> 58:37.012
But, uh, that means you
gotta, you gotta take care

58:37.096 --> 58:40.182
of this penguin for me tonight. Okay?

58:40.266 --> 58:42.851
Okay?

58:42.936 --> 58:44.102
Okay.

58:44.187 --> 58:45.270
All right.

58:53.321 --> 58:54.947
No, Millie, I will not hit the kid.

58:55.031 --> 58:56.114
I don't care what he did.

58:56.199 --> 58:56.782
Excuse me, sir.

58:56.866 --> 58:57.699
Hold on.

58:57.742 --> 58:58.782
Yeah, I just don't believe

58:58.826 --> 59:00.118
in hitting my own kid, will ya.

59:00.203 --> 59:00.994
Excuse me-

59:01.079 --> 59:01.745
There's plenty of other
guys down here to hit

59:01.829 --> 59:04.748
if I wanna hit somebody. All right?

59:04.832 --> 59:06.041
Hey!

59:17.512 --> 59:19.930
Uh, excuse me.

59:20.014 --> 59:22.057
Can I help you?

59:22.100 --> 59:24.059
I need help.

59:24.143 --> 59:26.395
Did you explain your problem
to the Sergeant at the desk?

59:26.437 --> 59:27.563
Hey.

59:28.398 --> 59:32.317
You look just like Ed Fitzgerald,
may he rest in peace.

59:32.402 --> 59:33.986
I'm his son.

59:35.488 --> 59:38.323
Did anybody ever tell you he saved my life?

59:38.408 --> 59:40.409
You Bigfoot Sullivan?

59:43.746 --> 59:45.914
The very same.

59:45.957 --> 59:49.042
Listen, I need help now, fast.

59:59.053 --> 01:00:00.596
Come on, kiddo.

01:00:00.638 --> 01:00:02.431
There we go. Yeah.

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:08.687
That outta hold you.

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:09.813
You got any fish?

01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:11.440
Fish?

01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:14.192
Yeah, I thought he might be hungry.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:16.778
No, I don't have any fish.

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:19.656
We'll just have to hope he likes beer.

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:20.782
Thanks, James.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.723
I don't wanna walk into the neighborhood.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.892
Why not?

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.257
I told ya my Aunt Pam's only
two stops away on the trains.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:50.979
We could take the trains.

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:53.148
Huh. We?

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:56.485
Absolutely. Look, I'm protecting you now.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:03.992
No, wait a minute.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:08.246
What?

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.498
Linda...

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.750
What?

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:17.172
You gotta kiss me about,
uh, six times right now.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:20.258
Oh, come on. We're in a hurry.

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:21.927
No, there's got to be time for this.

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:23.261
Well, what if I don't want to, huh?

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.680
You gotta. It's your duty, okay?

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:26.556
It's like a medical emergency.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:34.356
One-two-

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:37.150
three-

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:39.069
four-

01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:40.153
five-

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.279
six.

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.170
Come on, chucklehead.

01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:07.723
What is it?

01:02:07.765 --> 01:02:09.516
I think your dog sees something.

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:14.938
It's a bird.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.567
It's a big dead bird.

01:02:18.609 --> 01:02:20.986
I thought it was a bloody
foot or some shit.

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:23.155
But it's just a big dead penguin.

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:25.323
So some nutcase killed a bird.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:28.410
That's bird blood over there.
It's just bird blood.

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:30.662
I think it's a penguin.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.622
So where's Linda?

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:35.167
Probably where we outta be. Home in bed.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.509
What did you call me?

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.136
Chucklehead.

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:46.762
You want to stay pretty?

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:50.015
You like birdbrain better?

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.600
Yeah, birdbrain. That's, uh

01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:53.351
that's way up there.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:57.481
Yeah, yeah, it's right
up there with geekface.

01:02:57.565 --> 01:02:58.607
Hi, Linda.

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:03.361
No!

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:06.323
Shit!

01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:10.702
Leave her alone!

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.162
Get away from her!

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.629
Get away from her!

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:26.259
Get away!

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:29.721
Get off her!

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:33.308
Heinz! Heinz! Heinz! Look at me!

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:34.976
Look at me!

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:37.479
Get the fuck off her!

01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:44.903
Linda!

01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:54.204
No!

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.250
Who's he calling?

01:04:40.334 --> 01:04:46.756
He's callin' the girl's house
to see if she's there.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:47.966
Penguin.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:50.302
Yeah.

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:53.221
Who'd kill a penguin?

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:56.141
An Eskimo might. For food.

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.768
An Eskimo, huh?

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.812
Ain't no Eskimos around here.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:06.484
No, but an Eskimo is a kind of I ndian.

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.486
You trying to pin this on the Indians too?

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:10.322
Oh no.

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:13.491
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.953
No, this was Heinz.

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:21.833
There ain't no Eskimos in the Bronx... yet.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.002
She's not there. She never got home.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:28.590
Call in, okay? See if
anything's been reported.

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:30.467
Hell of a dog. St. Bernard, right?

01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:32.010
Yeah.

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.678
He acts like a friggin' bloodhound.

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.722
Yeah, well, they're rescue dogs, you know.

01:05:35.806 --> 01:05:38.087
They use 'em for findin' people
that get lost in the Alps.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.602
Okay, we'll be right in!

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:44.314
Hey. They just brought
in a guy we should see.

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:49.778
Did you see where he went?

01:05:49.862 --> 01:05:51.863
No, they were gone. This is all I found.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.365
Somebody check on Heinz's mother?

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.033
We sent a patrolman over there

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:56.326
but the mother said she ain't seen him.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:57.953
Did the patrolman stay?

01:05:58.037 --> 01:05:59.955
No, but I sent over a plainclothes.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:02.123
Good.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:06.962
Then let's go. I think we
both had the same stupid idea.

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:21.393
Hey, I seen Sullivan just going.

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:23.061
He travels with a dog now, huh?

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.188
Yeah, he's a regular Sergeant Preston.

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:30.735
33rd Precinct.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.403
Sully?

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.989
Sullivan? No, he just left.

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.448
I'm just checking to say that I'm here.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:36.324
Stakeout?

01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:37.325
Yeah.

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:38.785
You see the apartment?

01:06:38.869 --> 01:06:39.744
Ah, I'm looking up there right now.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:40.620
Any action?

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:42.789
Nah. Nothing's going on.

01:06:42.873 --> 01:06:44.249
All right. Check in on the hour.

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.500
And don't fall asleep.

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:46.918
Right.

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:50.672
Call you tomorrow.

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:53.174
All right.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:57.012
Now, ready to sit up here with me?

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:08.189
Happy?

01:07:08.232 --> 01:07:10.358
You know, Melanie

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:14.070
I don't like it, your always
sittin' in the back seat with Brita.

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:16.364
I can't believe that I broke this nail.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:19.117
I'm talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to you.

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.870
And, and you're all the time getting high.

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:23.872
Tonight is the first time

01:07:23.956 --> 01:07:26.458
I seen you and Brita straight
at one and the same time

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:30.920
in like, I don't know, forever.

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:32.047
Sal...

01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:33.423
What?

01:07:33.507 --> 01:07:35.258
Would you please take me home?

01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:37.052
I'm very tired.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.313
Look, what's the dog's name?

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:49.397
The Buddha.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.316
Buddha.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.111
All right. Give the Buddha
the sweater to smell.

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:56.738
Listen, I don't know if this is gonna work

01:07:56.822 --> 01:07:58.782
you know, this ain't exactly the Alps.

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:00.700
I don't know why you drafted this nutcase

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:03.953
to do your job in the first
place, Officer Dragnet.

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:06.081
Hey, look, you.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:09.959
I got a All Points out for Heinz right now.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.921
I got his apartment staked out.

01:08:12.963 --> 01:08:14.589
Now that's about all that I can do

01:08:14.673 --> 01:08:16.299
that makes any real sense.

01:08:16.383 --> 01:08:18.426
But that's not enough for me, all right?

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:22.346
So I'm down here in the friggin'
subway with a St. Bernard

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:24.140
doin' somethin' that, like as not

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:26.184
back at the Precinct is
gonna get me nominated

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:28.645
for Hoople of the Year!

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.854
Now I can live with that, but please

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:34.776
don't make me think about it too much.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.903
Now this guy is here because he owns a dog.

01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:38.947
I'm not gonna start askin' why you're here

01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:44.285
unless you start bustin' my hump.
All right?

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:46.121
So give the stupid dog the
stupid sweater to smell

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:48.540
and let's see what happens!

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.299
He's smellin' it.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:03.179
I think he's eatin' the friggin' thing!

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:04.889
I think he's doing it.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.683
I think he picked up the trail.

01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:08.685
Okay. I guess we follow the dog.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.247
Look, I'm sorry

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:54.082
I gave you such a hard time before.

01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:55.667
I appreciate what you're doin'.

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:57.252
Is she your girlfriend?

01:10:57.336 --> 01:11:00.630
Yeah... nah... you know, it's on and off.

01:11:00.714 --> 01:11:02.090
Don't worry about nothin'.

01:11:02.174 --> 01:11:04.676
Guys like this Heinz, they
get wound up real good

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.511
then they bust like a two-dollar watch.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.598
Stay with Sullivan! I'll get him!

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:12.600
Let's go-but don't get ahead of me!

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.455
All right, my friend, don't move, please!

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.444
Linda's in there!

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:31.179
Mazola!

01:12:31.263 --> 01:12:32.930
Yeah?

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:35.558
Are you dead?

01:12:35.642 --> 01:12:39.103
No. Is Heinz dead?

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:41.564
No.

01:12:41.648 --> 01:12:45.693
Then-the night's over for me

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:47.612
but not for you.

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:52.450
I'll have you in Jacobi
Emergency in ten minutes.

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.577
That's it for you guys.

01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:57.372
From here on in it's strictly O.
K. Corral time.

01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:06.047
All right, I'm sorry. Okay? I apologize.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:12.220
Well, that's very sweet,
but I do not accept.

01:13:12.262 --> 01:13:14.555
Come on, Melanie.

01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:18.434
What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry, I said.

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:20.812
Don't do this to me, Melanie.

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:22.656
I've been sick about
doin' what I did, okay?

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:24.607
I've been sick about it.

01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:27.985
But you've been fucked
up all the time and I...

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:32.782
I figure one day we're gonna have kids.

01:13:32.866 --> 01:13:35.159
I don't want want their
mother in the back seat

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:37.286
poppin' pills with Brita.

01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:01.811
You all right?

01:14:01.895 --> 01:14:02.895
What?

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:03.813
You all right?

01:14:03.897 --> 01:14:06.524
Yeah. You?

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:09.735
Yeah. What was that?

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:12.530
I dunno. Some friggin' total maniac.

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:16.701
♫ I n Dublin's fair city ♫

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:20.121
♫ Where the girls Are so pretty ♫

01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:27.837
♫ Had a wheelbarrow ♫

01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:30.798
♫ Through the streets Broad and narrow ♫

01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:35.470
♫ Crying cockles and mussels ♫

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:16.427
Who is it?

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:20.264
It's me!

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.600
Maybe you should come back in the morning

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.852
and we can have a nice breakfast.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:27.021
Open the fuckin' door!

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:33.528
Oh, you brought home a friend.

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:36.531
Yeah. I brought home a girlfriend.

01:15:36.573 --> 01:15:39.242
A girlfriend. That's nice.

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:42.370
You'll probably be getting
married soon and leave the nest.

01:15:42.454 --> 01:15:43.621
Should I put on some music?

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:46.207
No. No music.

01:15:46.291 --> 01:15:50.044
Would your friend like something to eat?

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:51.128
A sandwich?

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:54.590
No.

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:56.801
She's tired, ain't she? Let her sleep.

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.302
I'll put a blankie on her.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.762
No, I said no!

01:15:59.846 --> 01:16:01.973
Okay.

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:04.392
Oh I was havin' the most beautiful dream

01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:06.102
when you rang the bell.

01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:07.812
Your father was still alive

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:12.275
and, and we was eatin' fish.

01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:13.943
You're dreamin' right now.

01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:15.653
Me? No.

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:18.406
I'm awake now, Heinz.
Can I play some music?

01:16:18.448 --> 01:16:20.908
No. You're sleepin'.

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:22.243
No. I'm not.

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:25.746
Wake up. Wake up, Ma!

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.748
I'm not sleepin'.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:30.418
Look at me.

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:33.337
Look. At. Me.

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:36.465
What do you see?

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:38.676
My boy, my little boy.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.012
Wake up. I'm tellin' you!

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:42.597
What was that?

01:16:42.639 --> 01:16:44.098
Oh, no!

01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:52.273
The cops been here?

01:16:52.357 --> 01:16:54.400
A policeman came and asked about you before

01:16:54.484 --> 01:16:56.777
but I told him you wasn't
lost, you was just out.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.155
Listen!

01:16:59.239 --> 01:17:00.990
I'm gonna die tonight, Ma.

01:17:01.074 --> 01:17:04.619
No. Let me, let me play some music...

01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:07.371
I'm gonna die tonight, Ma.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:10.541
Just once-just once

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:14.962
before I die-

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:16.881
I'd like ya ta see me.

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.883
I see you.

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.843
Who am I?

01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:22.511
You're my little Heinz.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:24.722
Where have I been?

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:26.390
I don't know.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:28.184
I've been in jail, Ma.

01:17:28.268 --> 01:17:29.393
No.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:32.063
I've been in jail.

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.065
And now I'm out and the cops
are comin' for me again.

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.900
And they're gonna kill me.

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:37.568
No. I'm-I'm-
I'm gonna go.

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:39.070
What's my name?

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.988
Heinz.

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:43.074
Who am I to you?

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:45.409
You're my boy.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:48.996
And what's your boy gonna do tonight?

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:56.337

01:17:56.421 --> 01:18:00.007
Tell me!

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:01.175
He's gonna die.

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:19.019
Thank you.

01:18:36.002 --> 01:18:37.169
Thank you, ma.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.633
Oh, Heinz!

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.218
Heinz!

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.013
Holy shit.

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.394
Watch this dog.

01:18:57.941 --> 01:18:59.358
Call an ambulance!

01:19:07.659 --> 01:19:08.951
Linda, you in there?

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:12.788
Linda!

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:14.457
Be quiet!

01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:36.103
Hey, hey, hey.

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:37.521
Yeah, I'll be right there,
sir, just a minute.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:38.606
Where the hell's the stakeout?

01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:40.191
Under that mess.

01:19:55.415 --> 01:19:56.832
The woman on the sidewalk's dead.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.667
Neighbors say it's Heinz's mother.

01:19:58.752 --> 01:20:01.378
What happened?

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.463
Let's go in.

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:03.506
He's got a gun.

01:20:03.673 --> 01:20:04.965
I don't care. We gotta get her.

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:05.591
But he's got a gun.

01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:07.551
I don't care! I don't care!

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:08.636
James.

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.346
James!

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:12.515
You know, forget about the gun, Harry.

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:15.976
I could just kill myself bangin'
into this door over and over!

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:33.577
I want the two of you to
go cover the fire escape.

01:20:37.707 --> 01:20:39.834
And I want you on the
front door, all right?

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:41.001
Yes sir, you got it.

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:44.338
He's on the roof.

01:20:58.687 --> 01:20:59.895
He's going to throw her off.

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.772
No, he won't.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:04.608
Sully, we've got a guy up
on the roof over there.

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.110
Where, here?

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:07.862
No, right behind ya, next door.

01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:08.988
Let's go.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.535
Let's rush him. We'll knock him right off.

01:21:14.619 --> 01:21:16.036
No, no violence.

01:21:16.079 --> 01:21:18.789
No
- What are you, nuts?

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.749
You save that shit for M ississippi.

01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:58.621
Heinz.

01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:06.670
Let her go.

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.881
You still love me?

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:11.300
Yeah.

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:16.639
Come here.

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:20.809
Come here to me.

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:25.022
I'm not going to lift a
finger to you, Heinz.

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:26.941
Those days are gone for me.

01:22:32.989 --> 01:22:36.158
Just let me take the girl off
the ledge before she falls.

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:43.040
Do whatever you want to me.

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:45.668
Just let me take the girl off the ledge.

01:22:45.752 --> 01:22:49.546
If you get a clear shot, take
him down. He's a cop killer.

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:52.257
I'll try, but one nudge
and the girl's dead.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:02.017
You don't want to hurt her now, do you?

01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:19.827
Taking him out.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.758
Sullivan, there's too much goin' on here.

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.301
I ain't gonna risk another shot.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:58.615
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard!

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:00.617
Run!

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:02.619
Are you all right?

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:03.704
Linda!

01:24:03.788 --> 01:24:04.872
You look at me!

01:24:04.914 --> 01:24:05.914
Linda!

01:24:06.916 --> 01:24:08.167
Go hide.

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.326
Come on! Come on!

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:43.869
Come on!

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:45.913
Come on!

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:42.052
Sorry.

01:25:51.771 --> 01:25:53.897
Harry...

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:56.859
I know you, Harry.

01:25:56.943 --> 01:26:01.071
You've always been good, and
I've always been bad, huh?

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:04.491
Ain't that right, Harry?

01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:06.994
You love me?

01:26:07.036 --> 01:26:10.247
You ain't got the right.

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:14.835
If I let you go, would you kill me now?

01:26:14.919 --> 01:26:17.671
If I gave you the shot

01:26:17.755 --> 01:26:19.840
would you throw my ass off this roof, huh?

01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:21.884
Please?

01:26:21.968 --> 01:26:23.510
No.

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:31.185
Then, good boy, you tell me this.

01:26:31.227 --> 01:26:34.688
What good are you to me now?

01:26:47.243 --> 01:26:48.327
Okay.

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:02.359
Maybe there are I ndians in
the friggin' neighborhood.

01:28:05.863 --> 01:28:10.492
Hey. Better have somebody
take a look at that.

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:11.928
Fell? He threw her out the window.

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:13.847
Such a cheerful woman.

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:16.183
She had a screw loose.

01:29:16.225 --> 01:29:17.768
Pst. Still.

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:20.062
I saw the stain on the sidewalk.

01:29:20.146 --> 01:29:22.314
Sad. Sad.

01:29:24.984 --> 01:29:27.277
Excuse me.

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:29.196
Hello.

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.031
Oh, my.

01:29:31.115 --> 01:29:33.075
Could you tell me which
way is Leland Avenue?

01:29:33.159 --> 01:29:36.411
Two blacks-blocks

01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:37.788
that way.

01:29:37.872 --> 01:29:39.456
Thank you.

01:29:46.923 --> 01:29:49.549
You know, uh-

01:29:49.592 --> 01:29:52.219
someone who I intend to
work with once told me

01:29:52.303 --> 01:29:54.971
that a Negro couldn't walk
through this neighborhood.

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.974
You ever heard anything so absurd?

01:29:58.059 --> 01:29:59.893
Thanks for directions.

01:30:23.876 --> 01:30:26.461
Excuse me, is this the
Fitzgerald residence?

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:28.004
Yeah, it is.

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.256
Is Harry home?

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.757
Yeah.

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:33.176
I'm Samuel Kemp, here to see him.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.637
It's nice to see you, Samuel.

01:30:35.721 --> 01:30:36.930
Come on in.

01:30:40.309 --> 01:30:41.351
Go on.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:31:01.204
