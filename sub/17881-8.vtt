00:04.593 --> 00:07.439
Comunication. It's the word to any
successful relationship.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.672
It's true between people,

00:08.673 --> 00:10.373
and between the company
and theirs employess.

00:10.820 --> 00:12.032
Debie.

00:12.548 --> 00:13.618
Relax.

00:13.619 --> 00:14.628
Breath.

00:14.663 --> 00:16.350
Turn.

00:16.351 --> 00:17.496
Hello.

00:17.497 --> 00:19.476
I want comunicate to you
and idea had bought

00:19.511 --> 00:21.736
- The meals-ready-to-eat project.
- I'm sorry. It's my fault.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.088
What's your fault?

00:23.089 --> 00:24.623
I'm not prepared
to have a meeting right now.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.233
Oh, no. We're not having
a meeting. We're just...

00:26.268 --> 00:28.074
I'm not prepared,
I wish I was.

00:28.075 --> 00:31.559
because when I'm not prepared,
I get nervous and repeat.

00:31.776 --> 00:32.863
Repeat.

00:32.864 --> 00:35.483
Why don't I just jot
my idea down and send it to you?

00:35.736 --> 00:37.432
that would be fantastic.

00:37.433 --> 00:38.705
Fantastic.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.660
She gets a little
nervous around me.

00:42.661 --> 00:44.892
Luckily talk with Debie isn't
only way to

00:44.927 --> 00:46.109
We communicate around here.

00:46.110 --> 00:48.874
There's also the memo.

00:48.875 --> 00:52.140
memo 314...
employees must not use

00:52.141 --> 00:55.608
offensive or insulting
language in the workplace.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.412
"Employees must now use
offensive or insulting language

00:58.413 --> 01:00.864
in the workplace"?
This has to be a mistake.

01:00.899 --> 01:02.576
Why would the company want
us to swear at each other?

01:02.611 --> 01:04.697
Well, maybe they're trying
to make the people at work

01:04.733 --> 01:08.842
seem more like a real
family, butt-munch.

01:09.324 --> 01:10.908
Yeah, this is gonna be good.

01:10.909 --> 01:12.552
Like everything
the company does to us,

01:12.553 --> 01:14.391
is got to save money,

01:14.426 --> 01:17.087
maybe when someone's called
a "lazy sack of crap,"

01:17.122 --> 01:20.275
they work harder so they
can just be a "sack of crap."

01:20.310 --> 01:21.804
Oh, this is gonna be a problem.

01:21.805 --> 01:23.261
People here follow memos.

01:23.296 --> 01:26.405
That memo came out saying
people have to follow memos.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.490
This one is gonna
cause potty-mouth chaos.

01:28.525 --> 01:30.351
Oop, Ted's gearing up for a burst of

01:30.386 --> 01:31.829
middle-management leadership.

01:31.864 --> 01:34.225
Out goes the chest,
up goes the chin...

01:34.260 --> 01:36.490
I am going to go get
this fixed.

01:36.491 --> 01:38.245
And away.

01:39.653 --> 01:41.085
This whole memo thing

01:41.120 --> 01:43.342
Is bringing up this
strange sensation.

01:43.701 --> 01:45.957
It's like my feelings are itchy.

01:45.992 --> 01:48.248
Oh. Sounds like
something human is trying

01:48.283 --> 01:51.500
- to fight its way out of you.
- Yes, I think it's an emotion...

01:51.664 --> 01:54.101
like joy or spicy food.

01:54.136 --> 01:56.701
Technically, spicy food isn't a...

01:56.702 --> 02:00.138
So what is it about the
memo that brings all this up?

02:02.140 --> 02:04.593
well, it reminds me of
another memo five years ago,

02:04.628 --> 02:06.938
when I was promoted to this job.

02:06.973 --> 02:08.555
I was up against this man... Walter...

02:08.590 --> 02:10.481
who had the same last name as I do,

02:10.515 --> 02:12.895
although we pronounce it differently.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.644
There's another way
to pronounce "Palmer"?

02:15.679 --> 02:17.645
In his family, the "p" is silent.

02:17.924 --> 02:19.403
I think they're dutch.

02:19.438 --> 02:22.417
Sounds like their stupid
handiwork, with their cheeses

02:22.452 --> 02:24.596
and their giant propeller buildings.

02:24.631 --> 02:27.246
So Walter... "almer"?

02:27.281 --> 02:29.716
I know. Those people are unbelievable.

02:29.751 --> 02:32.858
Anyway, they announced
the promotion in a memo,

02:32.859 --> 02:34.516
Congratulating V. Palmer

02:34.551 --> 02:36.671
only then,
it went on to wish him well.

02:36.706 --> 02:38.899
I put through the paperwork,
but I've never known

02:38.934 --> 02:42.124
whether that job was really
meant for me or Walter.

02:42.159 --> 02:44.659
Maybe that itchy feeling
you have is guilt.

02:44.694 --> 02:47.670
Guilt is a powerful emotion.
Every Thanksgiving, it makes me

02:47.705 --> 02:50.842
take three planes just so i
can visit my racist aunt cookie.

02:50.877 --> 02:52.986
So this is guilt, huh?

02:53.021 --> 02:55.276
In the past, I've always
just counteracted this feeling

02:55.311 --> 02:58.287
with other emotions,
like sugar or drunk.

02:58.322 --> 03:01.398
You should talk Walter. Maybe
find some way to help him.

03:01.433 --> 03:03.250
Guilt it is a terrible thing
to carry around.

03:03.691 --> 03:06.449
Well, I do hate this feeling.

03:06.484 --> 03:09.966
- I hate it like I hate...
- don't tell me. The dutch?

03:10.040 --> 03:12.775
I don't hate the
dutch. I love the dutch.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.678
That's why I hold them
to a higher standard.

03:17.815 --> 03:19.042
I don't know where this
memo came from...

03:19.077 --> 03:21.466
but it's obviously a mistake,
so I was hoping human resources

03:21.501 --> 03:24.182
- could put out a correction.
- We'll look into the matter.

03:24.217 --> 03:25.299
Really?

03:25.300 --> 03:28.410
No. The company doesn't
make mistakes like this, mr. Crisp.

03:28.445 --> 03:31.779
What about that memo
announcing "casual fribsday"?

03:31.814 --> 03:33.716
The company said
that wasn't a mistake.

03:33.751 --> 03:37.399
They explained that the ancient
mayans prophesized fribsday...

03:37.400 --> 03:39.308
the first ever end day of week,

03:39.343 --> 03:41.579
which will occur in 2024,

03:41.614 --> 03:44.732
and the company believes
should be celebrated casually.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.556
I'm going to wear a denim pantsuit.

03:47.427 --> 03:50.685
And when they urged all
employees to "carpoop"?

03:50.720 --> 03:53.235
That was not mandatory. Thank God.

03:53.270 --> 03:54.917
Although, we did find
out what people will do

03:54.952 --> 03:56.672
to park slightly closer
to the building.

03:57.374 --> 03:59.493
So you're not
gonna help me with this?

03:59.494 --> 04:01.143
Sorry. I like the memo.

04:01.189 --> 04:04.170
All day long, I have to listen
to people like you complain.

04:04.205 --> 04:06.244
Now I can finally
tell 'em what I think,

04:06.279 --> 04:09.801
- you white-toothed Ken doll.
- You know, having white teeth

04:09.836 --> 04:12.194
and looking like a handsome
doll is not exactly...'

04:12.195 --> 04:14.588
- turd-hat.
- Very enough.

04:14.623 --> 04:16.803
the company wasn't
going to retract the memo

04:16.839 --> 04:19.452
telling employees to be rude
and abusive, and that meant

04:19.454 --> 04:22.043
things we are going to get
very confusing for Phil in lab,

04:22.077 --> 04:24.825
who unfortunately never read
their memos.

04:24.826 --> 04:26.437
And so this new line

04:26.472 --> 04:28.550
of meals-ready-to-eat gives
the soldier in the field

04:28.585 --> 04:31.203
a portable meal with all
the home-cooked flavor of

04:31.238 --> 04:34.623
something mom used to chemically
dehydrate and vacuum pack.

04:34.658 --> 04:36.451
I was looking at the
ingredients and I was wondering

04:36.486 --> 04:39.304
if there's enough protein
content, you boob.

04:39.305 --> 04:41.512
Excuse me?

04:41.547 --> 04:43.030
I was wondering about
the protein content.

04:43.031 --> 04:44.724
- But then you said...
- You boob.

04:44.725 --> 04:45.784
There is.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.165
I suppose we could add more
protein to the thing we call

04:48.200 --> 04:50.566
"beige block three," or "stroganoff."

04:50.601 --> 04:53.905
It's got plenty of protein,
you big-eyed stick insect.

04:53.940 --> 04:55.323
The problem is the vegetables.

04:55.358 --> 04:57.646
Okay, fellas, let's just try
to keep it under control here.

04:57.681 --> 05:00.041
Don't listen to these
bucktoothed hillbillies.

05:00.076 --> 05:01.391
Taste is the real problem.

05:01.392 --> 05:02.884
It's a battlefield,
not a four-star restaurant,

05:02.919 --> 05:04.115
back-alley crab muffin.

05:04.150 --> 05:07.252
Okay,
I gotta ask... What's going on?

05:07.287 --> 05:10.407
Because this meeting is a lot
saucier than the one yesterday.

05:10.442 --> 05:12.273
Looks like somebody didn't
get the memo.

05:13.728 --> 05:15.034
he asks a simple question

05:15.035 --> 05:17.112
and you give him sarcasm
for the eighties?

05:17.113 --> 05:18.825
Here.

05:19.386 --> 05:20.716
oh, it's an actual memo.

05:20.717 --> 05:24.404
They want
us to insult each other... sir?

05:25.314 --> 05:26.797
that wasn't a good one.

05:26.832 --> 05:29.381
But in my meetings,
that's not going to happen.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.743
But the memo said we had to.

05:30.778 --> 05:32.724
Well, we're not doing
it in here, pudberger.

05:32.759 --> 05:35.802
What? That's his last name.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.088
So Veronica went down to
the basement...

05:43.123 --> 05:46.026
hoping she'd feel better if
she talked to Walter Palmer.

05:46.061 --> 05:47.673
Hello, Walter.

05:47.674 --> 05:50.219
I don't believe it.
Veronica Palmer.

05:50.254 --> 05:51.548
I'm sorry, Palmer.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.659
I never could get used to the way you
pronounce it.

05:53.660 --> 05:55.135
Here, I brought you a cake

05:55.170 --> 05:56.736
and a jar of herring.

05:56.771 --> 05:57.911
Maybe you can wait until I leave

05:57.946 --> 05:59.699
before you smear the cake
with it.

06:00.207 --> 06:01.242
I'm not dutch.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.400
Uh, and the dutch don't smear herring

06:02.435 --> 06:04.399
on half the things you say they do.

06:04.582 --> 06:06.934
But thanks for the
cake. Is it my birthday?

06:06.969 --> 06:09.152
I sort of lose track of time down here.

06:09.187 --> 06:11.621
No, I just want to say
I've always felt bad

06:11.656 --> 06:14.051
that we had to compete
for the same job.

06:14.052 --> 06:17.599
Please. I'm the one who feels bad.
I've always hated how I acted

06:17.634 --> 06:19.572
in the bull pen after
losing that promotion.

06:19.692 --> 06:21.923
It was not a good impression of you,

06:21.958 --> 06:24.118
and I'm sorry I stretched
out your shoes.

06:24.119 --> 06:25.246
Don't worry.

06:25.281 --> 06:27.245
They were the cheap footwear
of my former life.

06:28.387 --> 06:31.034
can I buy you something
to cheer this place up?

06:31.035 --> 06:33.503
Maybe a lava lamp or
a freezer of steaks.

06:35.134 --> 06:36.714
I'm the one who feels guilty

06:36.749 --> 06:38.389
about the way I handled your promotion.

06:38.424 --> 06:39.732
Let me make it up to you...

06:39.767 --> 06:42.203
take you out for a
drink or something.

06:42.204 --> 06:43.344
Ew.

06:43.379 --> 06:46.358
Are very thoughtful, but I can't.

06:47.328 --> 06:49.488
Oh, I get it. You're still mad at me.

06:49.523 --> 06:51.134
I'm such a jerk.

06:51.169 --> 06:52.887
And I deserve to carry this guilt around

06:52.922 --> 06:54.893
back and forth in this tiny basement.

06:55.877 --> 06:57.826
Okay, I'll have a drink with you.

06:58.165 --> 07:00.060
Any chance you have a bottle down here,

07:00.095 --> 07:02.169
and we can just knock it
out right now?

07:05.418 --> 07:08.021
That meeting was chaos. I
hate all the name-calling.

07:08.056 --> 07:09.598
And it's nott because my mama is fat

07:09.633 --> 07:11.003
and does sit around the house.

07:11.004 --> 07:13.379
I kind of like it.
It makes people freer...

07:13.414 --> 07:15.137
like they can say
whatever's on their mind.

07:15.172 --> 07:18.074
Even Debbie spoke up today,
and she never talks in meetings.

07:18.109 --> 07:20.741
Well, we're not doing
it in here, pudberger.

07:21.461 --> 07:23.139
What? That's his last name.

07:23.174 --> 07:24.747
All right, let's just try to regroup.

07:24.782 --> 07:26.953
Wait! You pretty-boy suit rack.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.263
What this m.r.e. Needs
is ethiopian stew.

07:31.477 --> 07:33.707
It's hearty, nutritious and simple,

07:33.742 --> 07:35.525
like all of you bastards.

07:36.109 --> 07:37.980
Debbie's never opened her mouth before,

07:38.015 --> 07:40.087
- and it was a good suggestion.
- It was a good idea.

07:40.122 --> 07:42.065
But then mark called her
a Tory-loving royalist,

07:42.203 --> 07:43.235
and everything fell apart again.

07:43.236 --> 07:44.274
You ju don't like this

07:44.305 --> 07:46.017
because you always
have to be in control.

07:46.052 --> 07:47.724
You're a control freak...
that's what you are.

07:47.725 --> 07:49.233
I don't always have to be in control...

07:49.509 --> 07:51.181
although, it is my
exact job description.

07:51.182 --> 07:52.937
You're tall, you're handsome,

07:52.972 --> 07:54.836
you got the power tie,
the power suit.

07:54.871 --> 07:56.506
People think you're intimidating, Ted,

07:56.541 --> 07:57.865
and you like that because it means

07:57.950 --> 07:59.906
- you get everything you want.
- Okay, first of all,

07:59.941 --> 08:02.740
my appearance is not my
fault. God made me this way,

08:02.775 --> 08:04.703
and then he told me
where to shop for suits.

08:04.704 --> 08:06.918
Ted, a little caos can be
a good thing.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.328
My grandpa met my grandma

08:08.363 --> 08:10.338
when a Tornado blew her into his barn.

08:10.496 --> 08:14.432
He pulled the rake out of her
chest and proposed on the spot.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.749
We really should have
been reading these memos.

08:17.784 --> 08:20.654
Damn! We didn't have
to work on Thanksgiving?

08:20.689 --> 08:22.594
And look! Like I suspected,

08:22.629 --> 08:24.840
we were supposed to
be wearing lead aprons

08:24.875 --> 08:27.181
when we were working on
that genital x-Ray project.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.478
Here it is.

08:28.513 --> 08:31.666
"Employees must now use
offensive or insulting language

08:31.701 --> 08:33.125
in the workplace."

08:33.159 --> 08:34.791
I can play this game.

08:34.826 --> 08:37.332
I wrote that humorous column
in my college newspaper...

08:37.366 --> 08:40.246
"Lem's snappy answers to
theoretical physics questions."

08:40.280 --> 08:43.119
Pow! You've been Lem-basted.

08:43.154 --> 08:45.052
I'm terrible at insults.

08:45.087 --> 08:47.993
As a child,
I was beaten up constantly.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.115
The best comeback i
ever came up with was,

08:50.150 --> 08:52.765
"you're right.
I'll work on that."

08:53.580 --> 08:57.485
I can help you, you
sad jar of hobo urine.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.909
Pow! I've been Lem-basted.

09:05.280 --> 09:08.715
Hey, who is that relaxed
and approachable guy?

09:08.750 --> 09:11.222
Is that Ted? Why, yes, it is.

09:11.257 --> 09:12.941
You look like you're on
your way to mix cocktails

09:13.159 --> 09:14.205
at a swim-up bar.

09:14.206 --> 09:16.148
Well, i-I was
thinking about what you said...

09:16.183 --> 09:18.804
about how I might seem a little
controlling and intimidating.

09:18.839 --> 09:21.269
So I tell you to take a look
at the way you approach life,

09:21.304 --> 09:24.235
and you put different
clothes on? What a dill weed.

09:24.270 --> 09:26.307
And that's not a
company-mandated insult.

09:26.342 --> 09:27.783
That one came from the heart.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.187
Well, come on.

09:29.222 --> 09:31.516
The clothes are symbolic...
the first step in saying

09:31.551 --> 09:33.591
that I'm willing to
try to make a change.

09:33.626 --> 09:35.701
Actually, I was hoping
the clothes would cover it.

09:35.702 --> 09:37.792
I had the worst night last night.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.159
Didn't you get the memo?

09:39.194 --> 09:41.583
Casual fribsday is not until 2024.

09:41.618 --> 09:44.114
I'm trying to be less
intimidating. Apparently, my...

09:44.149 --> 09:46.686
wow. That's the fastest I've
ever lost interest in something.

09:46.721 --> 09:50.700
I went out with Walter Palmer
last night because of you.

09:50.735 --> 09:52.403
Me? What did I do?

09:52.404 --> 09:53.832
You started questioning memos,

09:53.867 --> 09:55.226
which brought up all this itchy guilt,

09:55.261 --> 09:56.793
so I agreed to have
drinks with the guy.

09:56.936 --> 09:59.875
He told me, after he lost
the promotion, his wife left.

09:59.876 --> 10:02.575
I felt even more guilty, so i
let him take me out to dinner,

10:02.610 --> 10:04.769
where I learned he also lost his house.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.240
Then I find out he's living
in his parents' basement,

10:07.275 --> 10:10.143
which is so damp, his dog got
arthritis, fell down the stairs

10:10.178 --> 10:12.446
and now has to be carried
around like a suitcase.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.279
- So I let him kiss me.
- Oh, my God!

10:14.314 --> 10:16.584
But then I still felt guilty, so
I let him feel me up.

10:16.585 --> 10:17.714
- Oh, my...
- yeah.

10:17.762 --> 10:19.620
I'm thinking i
might need new breasts.

10:19.655 --> 10:21.224
These are covered in
sadness.

10:21.225 --> 10:24.039
Wow. This is like the most depressing
"penthouse" letter ever.

10:24.074 --> 10:26.736
I kept waiting for the guilt
to lift, but it never did.

10:26.771 --> 10:28.221
What am I gonna do?

10:28.596 --> 10:31.507
Maybe I'll buy him a boat.
Guys like boats, right?

10:31.542 --> 10:32.945
Hey, Veronica.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.674
I had a great time last night.

10:35.709 --> 10:38.275
I was wondering if maybe i
could take you to dinner later

10:38.310 --> 10:39.786
for a little Walter and Veronica,

10:39.787 --> 10:41.454
version 2.0.

10:42.401 --> 10:44.424
how would you like a boat?

10:44.425 --> 10:46.826
something you could
just get in and go...

10:46.827 --> 10:49.429
Really shove off...
Just get out of here.

10:49.430 --> 10:52.432
Well, I couldn't take a
gift like that from you.

10:52.433 --> 10:53.685
I'd feel too guilty.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.432
Yeah,
guilt. What a horrible thing.

10:56.467 --> 10:57.576
See you at 8:00.

10:57.611 --> 10:59.228
Oh, and this time, please don't say,

10:59.263 --> 11:01.977
"thank you for kissing with me."

11:06.196 --> 11:08.631
can you press "10" for
me, you rat-face nazi?

11:11.553 --> 11:13.376
Your breasts should be on display

11:13.411 --> 11:15.710
at the swiss museum of miniatures.

11:17.030 --> 11:18.996
You said 10, right?

11:19.852 --> 11:22.141
Before we start, I realize
some people may think

11:22.176 --> 11:24.066
I'm controlling and
a little intimidating.

11:24.067 --> 11:27.636
But I want you to know,
all ideas are welcome.

11:27.637 --> 11:30.338
Really. I want to hear
from everyone.

11:31.351 --> 11:34.321
could you repeat that in
English? I don't speak wuss-ass.

11:35.043 --> 11:36.494
We're not doing that in here, Phil.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.996
I'm so very sorry. You won't
hear another word out of me.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.292
So not being controlling
lasted for about one second?

11:42.327 --> 11:45.656
I'm sorry. The naggity-nag-nag
bitchy-bitch is right.

11:45.691 --> 11:47.691
Anything anyone wants
to say is fine by me.

11:47.692 --> 11:49.159
You heard the corporate chimp.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.194
Start making suggestions
for meals-ready-to-eat

11:51.195 --> 11:53.731
before his head goes back up his butt.

11:54.525 --> 11:56.819
I like fresh tomatoes,
right off the vine.

11:56.854 --> 11:58.156
Oh, come on, mark, use your head.

11:58.191 --> 11:59.308
How are we gonna get fresh...

11:59.309 --> 12:01.674
open forum, chim chim.
Just let the ideas flow.

12:01.709 --> 12:04.874
I'm sorry, mark. I'm writing it down.

12:04.875 --> 12:09.211
Sometimes when I'm lonely,
I like to watch myself eat.

12:09.212 --> 12:11.525
Why don't we put a mirror in there?

12:11.526 --> 12:13.143
You like to watch yourself eat?

12:13.178 --> 12:15.216
I'm writing it down.

12:15.217 --> 12:17.933
I like to have some wine
with dinner.

12:17.934 --> 12:19.609
They're soldiers!

12:20.427 --> 12:22.152
Writing it down.

12:27.721 --> 12:29.456
I need your help, slut.

12:29.491 --> 12:30.934
What's the problem, tight-ass?

12:30.969 --> 12:33.733
Easy, Linda. It's a
memo, not a magic shield.

12:34.379 --> 12:37.482
I need to make a man run
screaming from my life.

12:38.387 --> 12:40.021
I'm happy you
came to me for advice,

12:40.056 --> 12:42.599
but sad this is my area of expertise.

12:42.634 --> 12:45.220
I went out again with
Walter. Now if I blow him off,

12:45.255 --> 12:47.007
he'll think that i
hurt him five years ago,

12:47.042 --> 12:48.733
then looked him up and got
him to fall in love with me

12:48.768 --> 12:50.239
so I could hurt him again.

12:50.274 --> 12:51.934
Plus, I backed over his
foot when I was leaving,

12:51.969 --> 12:53.972
which, according to
our relationship math,

12:54.007 --> 12:56.202
means tonight's the night.

12:56.237 --> 12:59.412
Well, in my experience,
scaring a man away is pretty easy.

12:59.586 --> 13:01.487
Basically, you're gonna
want to put three words

13:01.522 --> 13:05.538
into heavy rotation...
future, babies, commitment.

13:05.573 --> 13:07.860
Back off! I need my space.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.477
Wow, those words are powerful.

13:17.568 --> 13:20.087
What are you ciphering there, jethro?

13:20.765 --> 13:22.665
I've really enjoyed
repeating the put-downs

13:22.700 --> 13:25.321
you've been feeding me, but
I want to do it on my own.

13:25.710 --> 13:28.226
Give a man an insult, he
can hurt people for a day.

13:28.261 --> 13:31.421
Teach a man to insult,
he can hurt people

13:31.456 --> 13:34.358
who tease him because
he never learned to fish.

13:34.393 --> 13:36.794
Anyway, I've devised a formula.

13:36.829 --> 13:38.695
Look at that.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.026
You had a problem in your life
and who stepped up to help you?

13:41.061 --> 13:44.036
Math. She has always been
there for you, hasn't she, Phil?

13:44.071 --> 13:47.734
If she ever took physical form,
I'd leave my wife and marry her.

13:47.769 --> 13:49.528
Stand in line, my friend.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.080
Anyway, it's really quite simple.

13:51.115 --> 13:53.687
You take a person's most
marked physical feature,

13:53.722 --> 13:56.656
compare it to genitalia...
male, female or animal...

13:56.691 --> 14:00.967
and end with the suffix
"-bag," "-wipe" or "-muncher."

14:01.002 --> 14:03.149
You could also add an
optional reference to excretion

14:03.184 --> 14:05.127
from any of the glorious openings

14:05.162 --> 14:06.712
offered by the human body.

14:07.078 --> 14:09.087
Should we take her for a spin?

14:09.122 --> 14:10.973
Excuse me, Roger?

14:11.008 --> 14:15.373
Your head looks like lizard
butt flap, you snot wipe.

14:21.551 --> 14:22.941
Walter.

14:22.976 --> 14:25.012
Hey... it looks like
somebody can't get enough of me.

14:25.047 --> 14:28.636
You're right. I can't. In
fact, we need to talk about us

14:28.671 --> 14:32.980
and the future of our babies
and how they'll be committed.

14:33.015 --> 14:35.888
Wow, that's a lot to take in. Okay.

14:35.923 --> 14:37.896
I need this relationship
to have a future

14:37.931 --> 14:40.188
because I need babies. That's right...

14:40.223 --> 14:42.842
big, screaming babies
shooting out of my uterus,

14:42.877 --> 14:44.700
just stacking up like cordwood.

14:44.701 --> 14:46.006
Really?

14:46.041 --> 14:48.583
Yes, sir. That's all
I ever think about...

14:48.618 --> 14:51.052
the future, babies and commitment.

14:51.087 --> 14:53.551
Future, babies, commitment.
Future, babies, commitment.

14:53.586 --> 14:54.947
Commitment, commitment,
commitment, commitment...

14:54.982 --> 14:58.239
whoa, slow down! This is
happening a little fast.

15:00.285 --> 15:02.650
Okay! I'll do it!

15:03.838 --> 15:06.047
- Babies, babies, babies, babies...
- yes!

15:06.082 --> 15:07.700
As many as you want!

15:07.735 --> 15:09.640
My parents always say
that since my wife left,

15:09.675 --> 15:12.408
I've been too cautious about
relationships, but damn it!

15:12.443 --> 15:14.418
This is the one. I know it is.

15:14.453 --> 15:16.975
Let's light this candle and blast off

15:17.010 --> 15:20.528
into a calm, settled,
monogamous relationship.

15:20.563 --> 15:22.902
Oh, my. Look at me.

15:22.937 --> 15:25.481
I'm so happy, I can't
feel my legs.

15:27.903 --> 15:30.939
so I took everyone's ideas for
the meals-ready-to-eat project,

15:30.940 --> 15:32.941
and here it is.

15:32.942 --> 15:34.743
The specs called for a soldier to carry

15:34.778 --> 15:36.431
three of these in his backpack.

15:36.466 --> 15:39.815
Now we have to design
a 14-foot soldier.

15:39.816 --> 15:41.249
Good news, Ted.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.585
I cured Walter of his
fear of commitment.

15:43.586 --> 15:45.919
He wants to get portraits
painted of the two of us

15:45.954 --> 15:49.046
with his suitcase dog, all
wearing turtlenecks.

15:50.027 --> 15:52.528
I've got a box lunch the
size of a handball court.

15:52.529 --> 15:53.977
Now I gotta go find Phil and Lem

15:54.012 --> 15:55.594
and straighten out this m.r.e.
Disaster.

15:55.595 --> 15:57.293
Don't "boo-hoo" me.

15:57.328 --> 15:59.873
Did that m.r.e.
Touch your boobies, Ted?

15:59.908 --> 16:02.737
Then shut the hell up.

16:05.574 --> 16:08.472
What I didn't know was Phil
and Lem weren't in the lab.

16:08.507 --> 16:10.550
They were having an entirely
different adventure...

16:10.585 --> 16:12.593
test-driving their new
insult-generating formula.

16:12.594 --> 16:14.609
Your eyes look like
two beady rabbit pellets

16:14.644 --> 16:16.582
on the face of a
monkey-licking pus-bomb.

16:16.617 --> 16:18.984
- You've just been Phil-abusted.
- Nice!

16:21.667 --> 16:23.887
That's it... fill up your
canker-blossomed hole,

16:23.922 --> 16:26.227
you ale-soused
apple-John.

16:26.228 --> 16:28.229
That was the elizabethan model.

16:28.230 --> 16:31.533
Ye have been served.

16:36.993 --> 16:38.280
nice man-boobs,

16:38.315 --> 16:41.742
for a panty-snatching steroid muncher.

16:41.743 --> 16:44.144
What's the matter? Didn't
you get the memo?

16:44.145 --> 16:46.146
no, Phil, he didn't.

16:46.147 --> 16:50.082
He delivers the water.
He doesn't work here.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:02.262 --> 17:04.630
thank God that finally broke.

17:04.631 --> 17:06.066
Hey, Ted.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.935
I may go home early
today and never come back.

17:09.730 --> 17:11.939
you can't go home.
I need you guys.

17:11.940 --> 17:14.909
And that's it... the insulting
language stuff has got to end,

17:14.910 --> 17:16.377
you douche-nozzles.

17:17.165 --> 17:20.714
Sorry. That was one for the road.

17:20.715 --> 17:22.817
We just got Ted-ucated.

17:22.818 --> 17:24.952
Look, Janet, it's crazy out there.

17:24.953 --> 17:26.847
Two of my guys just
got beaten with water.

17:26.848 --> 17:29.572
I'm sorry. There's
nothing I can do, mr. Crisp.

17:29.607 --> 17:31.724
I don't like that memo
anymore either.

17:31.725 --> 17:33.949
Way too many people
are having fun with my name.

17:33.950 --> 17:35.242
I'm surprised it took this memo

17:35.277 --> 17:36.641
to get that train out of the station.

17:36.642 --> 17:38.370
Look, I've had several complaints,

17:38.405 --> 17:41.101
but the company is not going
to admit it made a mistake.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.233
What if it didn't have to
admit it made a mistake?

17:43.268 --> 17:46.191
What if it could just say that
it... it's making a-a new policy,

17:46.226 --> 17:49.278
based on a groundswell
of employee opinion?

17:49.279 --> 17:52.115
Look at that pretty little
head of yours, working up ideas.

17:52.116 --> 17:53.934
I'm a fan.

17:53.935 --> 17:55.722
Well, I like you, too, Janet.

17:55.757 --> 17:58.621
So we gonna do this?

17:58.622 --> 18:00.888
What are we talking about,
exactly?

18:00.889 --> 18:02.261
End this policy.

18:02.296 --> 18:03.342
Oh, that.

18:03.377 --> 18:06.282
Well, if we call it a groundswell,

18:06.317 --> 18:07.865
I think the company would go for it.

18:07.866 --> 18:10.387
That way, it gets to
pat itself on the back

18:10.422 --> 18:12.812
for listening and being a great
communicationer.

18:12.813 --> 18:14.250
You mean "communicator."

18:14.285 --> 18:18.141
That's not what it
says in the handbook.

18:22.141 --> 18:24.075
hey, I just got this memo.

18:24.109 --> 18:25.977
We don't get to swear
at each other anymore.

18:26.011 --> 18:27.720
It was due to a "groundsmell."

18:27.721 --> 18:29.075
well, the good news is, this company

18:29.110 --> 18:31.215
does not squander its best
and brightest typing memos.

18:31.250 --> 18:34.665
So is this all going in the m.r.e.?

18:34.700 --> 18:37.888
Yeah. It now stands for "meal
really enormous."

18:39.089 --> 18:41.582
This is what happens when you
take everyone's suggestions.

18:41.617 --> 18:43.186
Well, why did you do that?

18:43.187 --> 18:45.771
Because someone I care
about thought I was controlling.

18:45.806 --> 18:48.666
You care that much
what I think about you?

18:48.701 --> 18:51.181
You are taing about me, right?

18:51.182 --> 18:52.650
Yes.

18:55.290 --> 18:57.943
so is any of this stuff usable?

18:57.978 --> 19:00.837
Yeah. Debbie's ethiopian
stew is pretty good.

19:00.872 --> 19:02.635
And... and when it hardens,

19:02.670 --> 19:04.786
it forms an unbreakable
arch support in your foot.

19:04.821 --> 19:06.891
Oh, well, see? There you go.

19:06.926 --> 19:08.961
All you needed was one good idea.

19:08.996 --> 19:11.010
And you got that because
you listened to everyone,

19:11.487 --> 19:13.488
which you did because
you listened to me.

19:13.523 --> 19:16.258
In case you missed it, the
lesson heris listen to me.

19:16.292 --> 19:20.049
What's this I'm hearing
about ethiopian stew shoes?

19:20.084 --> 19:21.962
It's all they're
talking about upstairs.

19:21.997 --> 19:23.971
Well, speaking of
exciting developments...

19:24.006 --> 19:26.223
when I was in h.r.,

19:26.258 --> 19:28.701
I dug up this old memo
about your promotion.

19:28.736 --> 19:31.061
All the executives had
to sign off on it.

19:31.062 --> 19:32.314
Really?

19:32.349 --> 19:35.586
"I know we agreed not to let
women into upper management,

19:35.621 --> 19:37.996
"but Veronica Palmer is man-smart.

19:38.568 --> 19:41.930
"And, hello, as she breaks
through the glass ceiling,

19:41.965 --> 19:43.802
we can all look up her skirt."

19:43.837 --> 19:47.567
Oh, my God. That promotion was mine.

19:47.602 --> 19:49.541
I didn't ruin Walter's life.

19:49.576 --> 19:52.586
what is wrong with
those old farts upstairs?

19:52.621 --> 19:54.805
Seriously, they wrote that in 2005.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.065
I am off to scrape Walter off my shoe.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.399
You may want to be more gentle...

20:00.434 --> 20:03.836
I have a hickey on my belly.

20:06.850 --> 20:09.494
And so Veronica went
down to the basement

20:09.529 --> 20:10.858
and broke up with Walter.

20:10.893 --> 20:13.437
But then she made it up to him

20:13.472 --> 20:16.350
by giving him a new aboveground office.

20:16.385 --> 20:19.787
Wow.

20:19.822 --> 20:22.123
thank you.

20:22.888 --> 20:26.113
Phil and Lem retired
their insult formula

20:26.148 --> 20:28.521
and made amends with the water guy.

20:31.386 --> 20:34.187
and I realized communication
isn't just about talking.

20:34.222 --> 20:35.475
It's about listening.

20:35.510 --> 20:38.310
Debbie, I just wanted to say

20:38.345 --> 20:39.857
I appreciated your work on the m.r.e.,

20:39.892 --> 20:41.798
and when it comes to any
other toughts you may have,

20:42.012 --> 20:43.063
I'm listening.

20:43.064 --> 20:44.604
I think
we should go out, Ted.

20:44.639 --> 20:48.086
You can do whatever you want to me.

20:49.466 --> 20:50.959
And just because I listen

20:50.994 --> 20:53.024
doesn't mean I have to
take every suggestion.
