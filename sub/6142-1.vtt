01:47.917 --> 01:51.353
<i>Yet another quick knockout for</i>
<i>Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.</i>

01:51.554 --> 01:53.579
<i>The fans let him know</i>
<i>how they feel about it.</i>

01:53.756 --> 01:56.748
<i>Hide the women and children.</i>
<i>This could get ugly.</i>

01:56.926 --> 02:01.056
<i>This crowd does nothing to hide</i>
<i>its anger over this latest debacle.</i>

02:01.464 --> 02:04.297
<i>The fans are mad as hell.</i>
<i>They don't want to take it anymore.</i>

02:04.500 --> 02:07.401
<i>They seem to be blaming Dixon,</i>
<i>a good fighter, for the decline...</i>

02:07.570 --> 02:11.836
<i>... not only of the heavyweight-division</i>
<i>guys, but of the entire sport.</i>

02:12.008 --> 02:13.441
<i>They're actually pelting...</i>

02:13.609 --> 02:17.170
<i>... the undefeated heavyweight</i>
<i>champion of the world with ice.</i>

02:17.346 --> 02:21.043
<i>Maybe this angry, visceral reaction</i>
<i>will pressure Dixon to fight someone...</i>

02:21.217 --> 02:24.152
<i>... who can fight back for a change.</i>
<i>If there's somebody out there.</i>

02:24.320 --> 02:29.553
<i>All of boxing is hoping for a warrior</i>
<i>who thrills us with his passion.</i>

04:57.640 --> 04:59.733
Time goes by too fast.

04:59.909 --> 05:03.174
Yeah? Not fast enough.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.575
- Your kid should've been here.
- That's all right.

05:05.748 --> 05:09.149
- No, it ain't all right.
- The kid gets a little busy sometimes.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.012
He don't get that busy.

05:11.320 --> 05:15.450
Let's not talk about it here, okay?
You're coming tonight, right?

05:15.658 --> 05:19.355
I'm working. I took the tour
the last three years.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.621
I know, but it's the anniversary.

05:21.797 --> 05:23.424
Fine. You got my word.

05:23.599 --> 05:28.059
I appreciate it, thank you.
I owe you, Paulie.

05:59.635 --> 06:02.798
Yo, Robert. What's going on?
Where have you been? You're late.

06:04.607 --> 06:07.269
No. I don't wanna hear this.
Look, your job performance...

06:07.443 --> 06:10.412
...is nowhere near good enough
to be pulling this.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.571
I don't give a damn who your father is.
You understand me?

06:13.749 --> 06:16.013
- All right. Now get out of here.
- Okay.

06:16.185 --> 06:17.914
Thank you, sir.

06:20.322 --> 06:22.586
Yo, Robert. Yo.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.521
- Hey, Rocky.
- Hey.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.054
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

06:26.228 --> 06:27.718
What's up, champ?

06:27.897 --> 06:29.592
- You caught me off guard.
- I know.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.699
I wanted to catch you
before you got busy.

06:31.867 --> 06:33.528
Yeah, it gets busy up there.

06:33.702 --> 06:36.296
- So how you doing? Yeah?
- Real good. Yeah.

06:36.705 --> 06:39.697
- Yo, Rock!
- Yeah, how you doing?

06:39.875 --> 06:41.502
Yeah, real good.

06:41.677 --> 06:44.271
Listen, you wanna go out
and get some coffee?

06:44.446 --> 06:46.141
I'm kind of behind. Maybe later?

06:46.649 --> 06:49.709
Yeah. That'd be great. You ought to
come by the restaurant tonight.

06:49.885 --> 06:52.319
I can have something
made special for you.

06:52.488 --> 06:56.390
Tonight I can't. I got plans.
A few of the guys get together.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.621
- Did I do something wrong?
- What do you mean?

06:59.795 --> 07:02.491
Well, I don't know exactly
what I mean...

07:02.665 --> 07:06.601
...but I just think, like, when I come
here, you don't feel so comfortable.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.066
And I certainly don't wanna do that.

07:10.439 --> 07:13.465
- Well, you throw a big shadow.
- A big shadow?

07:13.642 --> 07:16.270
You're not gonna get anything done
down here, Robert.

07:16.445 --> 07:19.812
Well, if you're not gonna introduce me,
I will. Hi, I'm William Tomilson.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.177
- How you doing?
- Your son works for me.

07:22.718 --> 07:24.413
- It's a good job.
- Yeah.

07:24.586 --> 07:27.419
I've told Robert about 20 times
that I wanted to meet you.

07:27.589 --> 07:29.750
You're pretty busy,
which isn't a bad thing.

07:29.959 --> 07:32.325
- I get a little tied up.
- Grab a shot, will you?

07:32.928 --> 07:36.159
I may not get this chance again.
Old warhorses have to stick together.

07:36.332 --> 07:38.664
- The old horses, yeah.
- I'll tell you.

07:39.535 --> 07:42.595
- Good thing it's not your left.
- This makes you popular with people.

07:43.005 --> 07:45.940
- One, two, three.
- Finally, we get to meet.

07:46.108 --> 07:48.838
I gotta get going. It was nice
to meet you face to face.

07:49.011 --> 07:52.378
You take care of yourself.
Robert, I'll see you later.

07:54.783 --> 07:58.344
I gotta get going.
I'll change my plans for tonight.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.385
That'd be great.
I'm looking forward to it.

08:00.556 --> 08:01.989
- How you doing?
- Okay.

08:02.157 --> 08:03.954
- Okay.
- All right.

08:04.126 --> 08:07.527
And do not let those numbers
drive you crazy.

08:07.696 --> 08:11.757
- Too late.
- Use an eraser, get rid of all of them.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.097
- Yo, Rock.
- Hey, guys.

08:15.471 --> 08:17.530
- Hey, Rock.
- Hey, how you doing?

08:32.988 --> 08:33.977
There you go.

08:39.660 --> 08:43.119
It'll be about 10 tenths.
You guys take care, okay? You got it.

08:46.435 --> 08:48.460
I'll try a few of these later on.

08:49.304 --> 08:51.829
- It's good for baking.
- How much...?

08:52.007 --> 08:53.975
- Yo, Paul, what's the cost?
- 58.40, sir.

08:54.143 --> 08:56.543
All right, take it out of that.
I trust you.

08:58.847 --> 09:00.542
- How you doing?
- You're too generous.

09:00.716 --> 09:02.445
Not a problem.

09:18.567 --> 09:21.001
How you guys doing?

09:27.342 --> 09:29.435
How we doing, Isabel?

09:29.611 --> 09:32.011
Okay, except for the freebie
reading the Bible.

09:32.181 --> 09:34.615
- He's okay.
- Just because you fought him...

09:34.783 --> 09:37.684
...don't mean you gotta feed him.
He doesn't look like a fighter.

09:37.853 --> 09:39.514
Spider Rico could hit.

09:39.688 --> 09:42.248
- Listen, how's your stomach?
- It's okay.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.756
If you keep rubbing olive oil
on your stomach...

09:44.927 --> 09:46.918
...your kid's gonna be
born very strong.

09:47.096 --> 09:49.963
- Okay, Rocky. Whatever you say.
- No, really.

09:52.835 --> 09:55.429
- Yo, how you doing, Spider?
- God bless you, Rocky.

09:55.637 --> 09:56.865
Thanks.

10:02.177 --> 10:04.168
How you guys doing?

10:06.014 --> 10:09.848
Jose, can you make something special
for my kid who's coming tonight?

10:10.052 --> 10:11.314
No problemo.

10:11.487 --> 10:14.581
Good. I appreciate it.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.260
<i>Back and forth, back and forth,</i>
<i>give and take.</i>

10:19.428 --> 10:22.693
And then I went in there like an animal
and threw him into the corner...

10:22.865 --> 10:26.562
...and I unloaded everything I had.
Hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.

10:26.735 --> 10:29.363
But Creed, he kept
busting me back pretty good...

10:29.538 --> 10:31.472
...and the agony began to pile up.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.939
Then I heard the best sound
that I ever heard in my life...

10:35.110 --> 10:36.737
- The bell.
- That's right, the bell.

10:36.912 --> 10:40.075
I ain't never been so tired,
and I'm sitting in my corner.

10:40.249 --> 10:42.877
I'm trying to figure out
how to survive the last round...

10:43.051 --> 10:44.882
...when Mickey leans
into my ear and says:

10:45.053 --> 10:48.147
"Come on, get out there
and fight this guy hard, you bum.

10:48.323 --> 10:53.158
You gotta be first. You gotta be first."
I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could...

10:53.328 --> 10:56.092
- "I would."
...I would."

10:56.265 --> 10:57.562
The end.

11:24.293 --> 11:27.490
<i>Yet another quick knockout for</i>
<i>Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.</i>

11:27.663 --> 11:30.325

11:30.499 --> 11:32.091

<i>... the undefeated heavyweight</i>

11:41.910 --> 11:45.209
Hello, Adrian's. Yeah?

11:45.747 --> 11:50.081
Tell him you can't make it?
Yeah, I'll give him the message.

11:51.486 --> 11:55.616
I just kept hearing Mickey's voice
in my head over and over again.

11:55.824 --> 11:57.724
I just dug down,
and before you know it...

11:57.893 --> 12:01.090
...it was toe to toe and it was...
Excuse me.

12:01.263 --> 12:05.495
Your son said he can't make it.
He said he'll take a rain check. Okay?

12:18.914 --> 12:20.108
<i>Look at these birds.</i>

12:20.282 --> 12:23.080
<i>Don't these birds look like candy?</i>
<i>Flying candy?</i>

12:23.252 --> 12:25.152
<i>Hey, birdie,</i>
<i>you wanna fly me home?</i>

12:25.320 --> 12:27.845
You need somebody
to walk you home?

12:28.790 --> 12:29.779
<i>No?</i>

12:29.958 --> 12:34.861
It's a cold night. We need a few laughs
in our life. What do you think? Maybe?

12:35.530 --> 12:37.521
<i>Maybe? Maybe?</i>

12:37.699 --> 12:40.190
<i>Okay. Let's get out of here, okay?</i>

12:55.183 --> 12:57.617
That place ain't changed much
from last year.

12:57.786 --> 12:59.549
Are we done?

12:59.855 --> 13:02.050
Hey, how you doing, Mick?

13:04.926 --> 13:06.894
That sign is falling apart, Paulie.

13:07.062 --> 13:10.395
The whole world is falling apart.
Look at us.

13:10.565 --> 13:12.931
Don't talk crazy, Paulie.

13:13.168 --> 13:18.435
You know, I think if you live someplace
long enough, you are that place.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.601
I ain't no talking building.

13:21.777 --> 13:24.041
Come on, it's getting late, Rocko.

13:24.346 --> 13:27.076
I get a headache from this train.

13:47.002 --> 13:49.869
I remember when
she was standing there...

13:50.038 --> 13:53.735
...all nervous and shy,
with this little smile.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.573
And all I wanted her to do
was trust me.

14:00.916 --> 14:02.884
She did.

14:03.952 --> 14:06.386
- She did.
- You done?

14:21.937 --> 14:24.735
- How long are we staying here?
- Not long.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.272
Well, I'm glad they tore
this ice rink down.

14:27.442 --> 14:28.670
Come on.

14:28.844 --> 14:32.644
You heard me.
I'm happy they tore it apart.

14:36.284 --> 14:40.744
First time I walked your sister
across this ice, we was over there.

14:40.922 --> 14:44.414
She was nervous, but I wasn't so great
on the blades either.

14:44.593 --> 14:48.620
Ice is stupid. People standing on ice
are more stupid.

14:49.865 --> 14:53.824
And over there,
when she was falling...

14:54.169 --> 14:55.636
...and my hand grabbed her...

14:56.772 --> 15:00.640
...and I got her arm through that coat,
I could feel it.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.206
Electric.

15:03.712 --> 15:06.146
You said the same thing
last year, Rock.

15:07.449 --> 15:08.711
Did I?

15:08.884 --> 15:11.079
- So you better develop your brain.

15:11.253 --> 15:13.118
- You're left-handed.
- Absolutely.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.586
Come on, Rock. Let's go.

15:18.026 --> 15:21.826
We're done. There's no place
to sit down around here.

15:21.997 --> 15:23.294
It's all right.

15:23.465 --> 15:27.799
It ain't all right! It's depressing
and freaking cold!

15:28.537 --> 15:30.164
What's the matter with you, Paulie?

15:30.539 --> 15:32.632
You're living backwards, Rocko!

15:32.808 --> 15:36.300
Change the channel from yesterday!
Yesterday wasn't so great!

15:36.478 --> 15:38.878
- It was to me.
- Not to me!

15:40.749 --> 15:43.912
You treated her good.
You had the good times.

15:44.820 --> 15:48.347
I treated her bad.
I don't have to think about this.

15:49.758 --> 15:51.919
She always loved you, Paulie.

15:56.231 --> 15:59.496
Sorry, Rocko,
I can't do this no more.

17:12.339 --> 17:13.500
Can I help you?

17:13.909 --> 17:16.570
No, no, I used to come down
to this place a long time ago.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.373
I was just looking around.
No big deal.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.476
Can I get you a drink?

17:23.417 --> 17:26.751
- All right. Maybe just a short beer.
- Okay.

17:35.664 --> 17:37.461
Go. Go on.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.264
Yeah, go on.
Get him to buy a round.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.335
Get him to buy a round. Go.

17:42.704 --> 17:45.571
Get him to... He's got it.
He's spending money.

17:45.740 --> 17:50.939
Listen, I don't mean to cross the line
or anything...

17:51.112 --> 17:54.104
...but I read about your wife's passing
a few years back.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.840
Yeah, it was woman cancer.

17:56.017 --> 17:58.986
Yeah. I always heard
she was a nice person.

17:59.154 --> 18:01.588
Yeah, the best.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.990
- Do I know you?
- We met a long time ago.

18:05.493 --> 18:06.551
We did?

18:06.761 --> 18:09.252
When I was a kid,
you walked me home.

18:09.431 --> 18:12.696
- I did?
- Told me to stop smoking and things.

18:14.235 --> 18:16.430
Stop smoking...

18:17.105 --> 18:20.632
Are you Little Marie that used to
hang out at that Atomic Hoagie shop?

18:20.809 --> 18:22.640
Yeah, that's right.

18:23.278 --> 18:25.644
Yeah, now I remember.
I walked you home.

18:25.814 --> 18:29.682
When you got there, you turned
around and said, "Screw you, creepo."

18:29.851 --> 18:32.183
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, you did.

18:32.354 --> 18:35.790
- You sure?
- Great insults last a long time.

18:35.957 --> 18:39.324
Yo! Yo, is that you?
Is that really you?

18:39.861 --> 18:42.193
- How you doing?
- I think he wants to drink alone.

18:42.430 --> 18:45.399
Well, then give him his drink, then.
I ain't stopping you.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.036
What's that, your man or something?
No, I don't think so.

18:51.873 --> 18:55.206
Anyway, me and my friends,
we're right down there.

18:55.377 --> 18:58.676
Think you could buy us a round?
You got the money. Just one round.

18:58.847 --> 19:01.748
Hey. Thank you.

19:01.916 --> 19:05.010
What are you doing
pushing my hand away like that?

19:05.186 --> 19:07.586
- What's your name?
- Angie. What do you wanna know for?

19:07.756 --> 19:10.725
- Don't be playing a fool for that guy.
- A fool?

19:10.892 --> 19:12.086
- Yeah.
- A fool?

19:12.260 --> 19:15.229
I'm the fool? You're the fool, not me!

19:15.397 --> 19:18.423
You got it twisted. You're the fool.
I'm a person, just like you.

19:18.633 --> 19:22.194
You ain't no better than me. You think
you're a big shot now? You're nothing.

19:22.370 --> 19:26.204
You ain't no better than me.
No better!

19:27.842 --> 19:29.139
Glad you dropped in?

19:29.310 --> 19:31.972
I think the neighborhood
is changing a little.

19:32.847 --> 19:35.577
- What was that all about?
- I don't know. Forget about it.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.981
I'm gonna lock up, so if you wanna
take off, I'll tally everything up.

19:39.154 --> 19:40.781
- Yeah, thanks.
- How you doing, Rock?

19:40.955 --> 19:42.547
I'm good, thanks.

19:45.093 --> 19:47.926
- You live around here?
- About eight blocks from here.

19:49.097 --> 19:50.928
Eight blocks.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.863
You need a lift?

19:54.335 --> 19:56.360
All right.

19:56.538 --> 19:58.335
Did you ever get married?

19:58.506 --> 20:00.303
- Yeah, sort of.
- Sort of?

20:00.475 --> 20:02.966
- Yeah, well, he took off.
- Poof, just like that?

20:03.144 --> 20:05.271
Yeah, just like that.

20:05.714 --> 20:08.581
- You sort of have any kids?
- Yeah, I got one kid.

20:08.783 --> 20:12.412
Yeah? Me too. Me too.
Wonderful boy.

20:12.587 --> 20:16.250
Hey, tough guy! What's the matter,
you can't buy a round?

20:16.424 --> 20:18.984
The girl was being nice
to your dumb ass.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.822
- What you doing with that pig?
- Think you can disrespect us?

20:21.996 --> 20:24.897
- She ain't nothing but a jealous bitch!
- Come on back!

20:25.266 --> 20:27.029
Hey, don't listen to them.

20:27.202 --> 20:30.228
Both of youse,
you ain't no better than me.

20:30.405 --> 20:33.670
Come over here, you'll get
your head kicked in around here.

20:33.842 --> 20:37.903
- You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.
- You ain't no big shot, look at you.

20:38.079 --> 20:41.981
You ain't even got a car
to take that pig home.

20:44.719 --> 20:46.016
You all right?

20:47.555 --> 20:48.544
Yeah.

20:51.192 --> 20:53.990
What are you doing?
Don't get out. It's all right.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.995
No, Little Marie. It ain't all right.

21:04.773 --> 21:06.536
- Yo.
- What?

21:06.741 --> 21:08.709
I'll tell you what. Get inside.

21:08.877 --> 21:11.903
- You get inside. Yeah, you.
- Hey, leave him alone!

21:12.080 --> 21:13.308
- Yo, man!
- See it?

21:13.481 --> 21:15.676
- You see that? You see that?
- Yeah. All right.

21:15.850 --> 21:18.182
- What do you say?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

21:18.353 --> 21:20.014
Get a job!

21:36.070 --> 21:38.038
That guy sends his apologies.

21:38.907 --> 21:40.374
Okay.

21:57.192 --> 22:01.561
Martin. Martin. Yo, Martin!

22:06.401 --> 22:08.301
I see you still got your key.

22:08.469 --> 22:10.369
Yeah, I got a key.
You got time to talk?

22:11.072 --> 22:13.768
I got a lot of time
since your people let me go.

22:13.942 --> 22:16.240
You know I had
nothing to do with that.

22:16.411 --> 22:17.935
Yeah.

22:19.614 --> 22:21.639
Yeah, we moved in
about a year ago.

22:21.816 --> 22:24.148
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, it's only temporary.

22:24.319 --> 22:27.220
- Yeah, I could see that.
- I'm gonna look for an apartment.

22:27.388 --> 22:28.980
Apartments are nice.

22:29.157 --> 22:30.886
Yeah. It is what it is, you know.

22:31.059 --> 22:32.959
Yeah, it is what it is.

22:33.127 --> 22:36.324
This place used to be pretty nice.
There's a lot of history around here.

22:36.497 --> 22:38.021
- Yeah.
- Like down the street...

22:38.199 --> 22:39.791
...is the Cambria Fight Club.

22:39.968 --> 22:41.833
They used to call it
the Bucket of Blood.

22:42.003 --> 22:45.268
I took some massive beatings there.
But it was nice. Good memories.

22:45.440 --> 22:50.503
And I heard these buildings are like,
I don't know, 100, 150 years old.

22:50.678 --> 22:55.741
If I was 150 years old, I'd be falling
apart too. So it's okay, building.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.145
Does that light work?

22:57.318 --> 22:59.650
- No, it's burnt out or something. Yeah.
- Yeah?

23:02.257 --> 23:06.660
Listen, thanks for the ride,
and I'm sorry about those guys.

23:06.828 --> 23:10.389
Some of those guys just got their
brains on backwards and stuff.

23:10.565 --> 23:13.432
- What's he doing out so late?
- Is that your kid?

23:13.601 --> 23:15.728
Yeah. Wish he wouldn't
stay out so late.

23:16.037 --> 23:18.835
- Amazing.
- Yeah, what's that?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.772
Last time I seen you,
you was a kid...

23:21.943 --> 23:24.104
...and now you officially
got one of your own.

23:24.279 --> 23:25.371
It's amazing.

23:25.546 --> 23:29.607
You know, he sort of resembles you.
He's got that big Irish hair.

23:30.518 --> 23:31.780
Yeah, it's the other one.

23:35.256 --> 23:37.656
- Yeah?
- His father was from Jamaica.

23:37.825 --> 23:39.156
Jamaica? European.

23:42.196 --> 23:44.596
Was you on a cruise ship
or something?

23:44.766 --> 23:46.700
- No, not really.
- What's his name?

23:46.868 --> 23:51.464
- Steps. Short for Stevenson.
- Makes sense.

23:55.009 --> 23:58.172
Does he look mad at me, or is it
maybe the angle I'm standing at?

23:58.346 --> 24:00.974
No. He's a good kid.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.583
- You wanna meet him?
- It's getting kind of late.

24:03.751 --> 24:07.346
- I got so many things to do.
- Yeah, yeah, I understand.

24:08.222 --> 24:12.158
Thanks again for the ride
and everything else.

24:14.195 --> 24:15.753
I'll see you.

24:16.898 --> 24:18.331
You too.

24:18.499 --> 24:22.435
Hey, Steps, come on. Let's go.
Say good night to your friend.

24:22.670 --> 24:25.104
What are you doing out
in the cold with no hat on?

24:25.273 --> 24:27.639
- Did you get something to eat?
- Yeah, I already ate.

24:27.809 --> 24:29.401
All right.

24:29.577 --> 24:31.909
- You're late, you know.
- I can take care of myself.

24:32.747 --> 24:34.681
Yo, Little Marie!

24:35.850 --> 24:37.818
Ain't you gonna
introduce me to your kid?

24:37.986 --> 24:40.216
- How you doing, Steps?
- What's up?

24:40.388 --> 24:45.587
Listen, I got this place, this restaurant,
nice little eatery not too far from here.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.728
What's all this junk? Got a tissue.

24:47.895 --> 24:51.558
Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo,
all the stuff in my pocket, you know.

24:51.733 --> 24:53.860
Here you go.
I got a card, there it is.

24:54.035 --> 24:56.094
And if you ever get a chance,
it'd be great...

24:56.270 --> 24:59.103
...if both of youse
come down there and eat.

24:59.273 --> 25:05.109
It'd be great, free. You know.
Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.

25:06.314 --> 25:09.841
I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.

25:13.388 --> 25:15.151
See you later.

25:17.191 --> 25:19.056
Come on, let's go.

25:21.596 --> 25:23.894
<i>You've known what's best for you</i>
<i>since you were 10.</i>

25:24.065 --> 25:26.090
Since you walked in here alone.

25:27.068 --> 25:29.536
Got everything money can buy...

25:29.704 --> 25:31.763
...except what it can't.

25:32.573 --> 25:36.566
It's pride. Pride is what got
your ass out of here.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.944
Losing is what brung you back.

25:41.516 --> 25:46.283
But people like you, they need
to be tested. Need a challenge.

25:46.454 --> 25:48.684
That ain't gonna happen.
Ain't nothing out there.

25:49.023 --> 25:52.424
There's always somebody
out there. Always.

25:52.894 --> 25:55.158
When that time comes
and you find something...

25:55.329 --> 25:57.797
...standing in front of you
that ain't running...

25:57.965 --> 26:03.335
...that ain't backing up, hitting on you,
and you're too damn tired to breathe...

26:03.704 --> 26:06.673
You find that situation on you,
that's good.

26:06.841 --> 26:09.366
Because that's baptism under fire.

26:11.446 --> 26:14.142
You get through that,
you find the only kind of respect...

26:14.315 --> 26:15.976
...that matters in this damn world:

26:16.150 --> 26:18.311
Self-respect.

26:20.855 --> 26:23.722
Thanks, Martin. I appreciate that.

26:23.891 --> 26:25.654
Now, what can the champ
do for you?

26:26.994 --> 26:29.656
You can give me
some of that money you got.

26:30.898 --> 26:33.458
- You know, I like you, Martin.
- But not that much.

26:34.569 --> 26:36.560
Exactly.

26:40.341 --> 26:42.571
How about a picture with the kid?
All right?

26:42.743 --> 26:44.142
Sure.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.878
Here, son, hold up your fist.
Makes you look more hazardous.

26:51.552 --> 26:52.814
- There you go.
- Thanks, Rock.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.852
Enjoy your meal.

26:55.690 --> 26:57.282
- He's a nice guy, isn't he?
- Rocky?

26:57.458 --> 26:59.585
- Yeah.
- Spider just went downstairs.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.228
- I don't know if that's all right.
- What's he doing?

27:02.396 --> 27:04.660
I don't know. That's your friend.

27:10.771 --> 27:12.204
Yo, Spider!

27:12.373 --> 27:15.934
- Let me do some dishes. I feel better.
- Come on. You're my guest.

27:16.110 --> 27:18.601
- Let me do something.
- Keep eating. Guests do that.

27:18.779 --> 27:21.213
Don't make me fight you again.
Last time you got lucky.

27:21.649 --> 27:23.708
Lucky? Okay.

27:23.918 --> 27:25.510
Jesus wants me to work.

27:26.220 --> 27:28.688
- Yo, Rocky.
- Yeah?

27:28.856 --> 27:29.948
You've got guests.

27:32.593 --> 27:34.322
Don't get too wet, okay?

27:35.730 --> 27:37.527
Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.

27:43.938 --> 27:45.599
You kept the card.

27:45.773 --> 27:47.604
Yeah, I kept the card.

27:47.775 --> 27:50.107
- Why don't you sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

27:59.687 --> 28:04.249
Because, you know what, I walk in
there, I say good morning, I do this:

28:04.859 --> 28:06.121
<i>Tonight, boxing once again.</i>

28:06.294 --> 28:09.058
<i>Two contrasting styles</i>
<i>in almost every way.</i>

28:09.230 --> 28:12.563
Hey, can you turn this up?
Turn this up, please.

28:12.733 --> 28:16.100
<i>Who was the best of all time?</i>
<i>If two athletes from different eras...</i>

28:16.304 --> 28:19.467
<i>... could compete against one another,</i>
<i>who would come out on top?</i>

28:19.640 --> 28:23.440
<i>Given the same rules, using the same</i>
<i>equipment, who was the greatest?</i>

28:23.611 --> 28:25.442
<i>We feed our facts</i>
<i>into the computer.</i>

28:25.613 --> 28:28.013
<i>They weigh in on who they</i>
<i>think will reign supreme...</i>

28:28.182 --> 28:31.310
<i>... while fielding the comments of our</i>
<i>illustrious panel of sportswriters.</i>

28:37.091 --> 28:38.718
Champ!

28:40.294 --> 28:41.761
- Yo, champ!
- Yeah?

28:41.929 --> 28:44.864
Come check out this trash
they're talking about you, man!

28:45.032 --> 28:47.967
- What you talking about?
- Come check this out. Hurry up.

28:48.269 --> 28:50.635
<i>Tonight, the former two-time</i>
<i>heavyweight champion...</i>

28:50.805 --> 28:52.830
<i>... from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.</i>

28:53.007 --> 28:54.975
<i>All right, Chuck Johnson,</i>
USA <i>Today?</i>

28:55.142 --> 28:57.906
<i>There's no question that</i>
<i>Rocky Balboa fought tougher fights...</i>

28:58.079 --> 28:59.637
<i>... during a tougher era in boxing.</i>

28:59.814 --> 29:01.645
<i>You look at Mason Dixon</i>
<i>in his career...</i>

29:01.816 --> 29:04.114
<i>... he's basically been</i>
<i>spoon-fed his opponents.</i>

29:04.285 --> 29:06.480
<i>No question in my mind.</i>
<i>Not only does Rocky win...</i>

29:06.654 --> 29:07.951
<i>... but he wins knockout.</i>

29:10.057 --> 29:11.684
Rocky!

29:13.060 --> 29:14.049
Offspring.

29:15.363 --> 29:16.387
<i>Bernard Fernandez?</i>

29:16.564 --> 29:18.327
<i>Dixon is a victim</i>
<i>of his own dominance.</i>

29:18.499 --> 29:21.559
<i>He's never been in</i>
<i>real knockdown-dragout brawls.</i>

29:21.736 --> 29:23.499
<i>He never had to dig down</i>
<i>to rally back.</i>

29:23.971 --> 29:25.871
<i>If he tries to dig down</i>
<i>against Balboa...</i>

29:26.040 --> 29:28.474
<i>... he'll find he doesn't have</i>
<i>a big enough shovel.</i>

29:28.643 --> 29:31.476
<i>I clearly give it to Balboa.</i>

29:31.679 --> 29:34.910
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

29:35.082 --> 29:37.482
<i>Boxing historian</i>
<i>Burt Randolph Sugar.</i>

29:37.652 --> 29:40.849
<i>Dixon has fought cream puffs.</i>
<i>We don't know what he's made of.</i>

29:41.022 --> 29:43.149
<i>But both in their primes,</i>
<i>you gotta factor in...</i>

29:43.324 --> 29:45.224
<i>... Dixon's unbelievable speed...</i>

29:45.393 --> 29:48.021
<i>... his slashing offense.</i>
<i>He cuts Balboa to bits.</i>

29:48.195 --> 29:51.028
<i>No doubt. Dixon wins all the way.</i>

29:52.333 --> 29:56.770
<i>Here's where our subjectivity ends.</i>
<i>Let's see what the computer says.</i>

29:56.937 --> 30:01.704
<i>Dixon unloads on Balboa. Rocky has</i>
<i>no answer. Balboa is eating jabs.</i>

30:02.743 --> 30:04.506
- What time is it?
- Mason time.

30:04.712 --> 30:07.340
- What time is it?
- Mason time.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.676
- What time is it?
- Mason time.

30:18.059 --> 30:22.519
<i>Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.</i>
<i>He is almost out on his feet!</i>

30:22.697 --> 30:25.222
<i>Balboa turning up the heat.</i>
<i>Pounds him across the ring.</i>

30:25.399 --> 30:29.130
<i>Boy, he's bit off more than he</i>
<i>can chew this time. Believe it.</i>

30:29.303 --> 30:32.636
<i>Oh, a murderous right hook!</i>
<i>And Dixon is out on his feet.</i>

30:33.040 --> 30:36.203
<i>He is out cold as he</i>
<i>crumbles to the canvas.</i>

30:36.377 --> 30:40.609
<i>And it is Balboa who has won...</i>

30:41.716 --> 30:44.514
Ladies and gentlemen, Baby Rocky.
Baby Rocky.

30:51.025 --> 30:55.462
I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat
that up, it's pretty good in the morning.

30:56.731 --> 30:58.198
Yeah, thanks, man.

30:58.733 --> 31:02.430
Nice kid. I hope this music ain't giving
you a headache. I like this old stuff.

31:02.603 --> 31:04.764
No, I like it. It's nice.

31:05.206 --> 31:07.231
Well, good. Good.

31:16.650 --> 31:20.882
Yo, you think Steps wants a job?
Make a few bucks on the weekend?

31:21.055 --> 31:24.684
It's good making your own G's. My kid
stashed a few bucks doing that.

31:25.259 --> 31:26.988
Why are you being so nice?

31:28.229 --> 31:30.424
I don't want you to think
nothing's off, you know.

31:30.598 --> 31:33.761
My wife, she's gone, but she ain't.
You know what I mean?

31:33.934 --> 31:36.027
Yeah, well, I wasn't thinking that.
Believe me.

31:36.203 --> 31:38.831
- No? Then what was you thinking?
- No.

31:39.006 --> 31:41.440
That you don't owe us nothing.
What are you doing?

31:41.609 --> 31:43.338
Be patient.

31:43.511 --> 31:45.001
Now...

31:45.546 --> 31:49.482
...I don't owe you nothing,
but why do you gotta...

31:49.650 --> 31:53.279
...owe something to get...?

31:54.255 --> 31:55.483
Bingo.

32:00.795 --> 32:05.129
Why do you gotta owe something
to get something, you know? Really.

32:08.002 --> 32:11.733
I think hanging out with your kid
would be nice. What do you think?

32:11.906 --> 32:14.101
I think that'd be nice.

32:15.176 --> 32:18.612
Good. That's very nice.

32:18.779 --> 32:20.974
I'm glad you come by.

32:21.449 --> 32:24.748
It was nice watching you eat.

32:26.654 --> 32:28.451
Good company.

32:31.492 --> 32:34.052
Yo, Little Marie. Let there be light!

32:45.105 --> 32:47.164
- You like dogs?
- Dogs?

32:47.341 --> 32:52.005
Dogs. This is like a dog pound.
It's where they keep...

32:52.480 --> 32:57.179
...a large variety of dogs. I used to
come here all the time for sightseeing.

32:57.351 --> 33:00.787
But, you know,
you learn a lot talking to dogs.

33:00.955 --> 33:04.413
- Really, you do.
- Yeah, man. So...

33:04.592 --> 33:07.083
Hey, man, how about this one?

33:08.729 --> 33:10.458
He don't look too friendly, my friend.

33:10.631 --> 33:13.327
Man, this is the one.
Hey, boy, how you doing?

33:13.501 --> 33:16.766
Hey, what about this one here?
Come here, boy.

33:16.937 --> 33:18.427
- Who, him?
- Yeah, why not?

33:18.606 --> 33:20.767
Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.

33:20.941 --> 33:25.275
I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.
If you look at it closely, the color...

33:25.446 --> 33:29.280
...it looks like old furniture, like some
kind of pirate-chest thing going on.

33:29.450 --> 33:31.884
Yeah, sure, man.
Hey, so how about a young one?

33:32.052 --> 33:35.544
Steps, forget him. Come over here.
I want you to see something.

33:35.723 --> 33:40.092
Now, you notice what this animal
is doing here? Lying in that position?

33:40.261 --> 33:41.489
He ain't doing nothing.

33:41.662 --> 33:44.392
No, he's doing a lot.
He ain't wasting no energy.

33:44.565 --> 33:45.725
Because he's dead.

33:52.006 --> 33:54.907
He ain't dead. There's a lot of
good mileage left on that animal.

33:55.075 --> 33:59.136
Good food, the addition of a couple
of new friends, bingo, he's back.

33:59.313 --> 34:02.749
- What do you think is a good name?
- It's your dog. You name him.

34:02.917 --> 34:05.511
No. It's, like,
a community animal. Fifty-fifty.

34:05.686 --> 34:08.154
Look, I don't know much
about no dogs.

34:08.322 --> 34:09.949
Well, it ain't that complicated.

34:10.123 --> 34:13.719
You pet him, you feed him,
and nature takes its course.

34:13.928 --> 34:16.761
You know, so...
Don't you wanna name an animal?

34:16.931 --> 34:20.958
Every guy should at one time
try to name an animal something.

34:21.467 --> 34:22.900
I don't know. Fleabag?

34:23.704 --> 34:27.764
It's catchy. It ain't original,
but it's pretty good.

34:27.942 --> 34:30.342
I think you could come up with,
in your young brain...

34:30.511 --> 34:33.503
...something better to throw out
than Fleabag.

34:34.348 --> 34:36.179
Punchy. How's that?

34:37.685 --> 34:40.085
- Punchy?
- Yeah, Punchy.

34:43.857 --> 34:45.882
- I like it, you know.
- For real?

34:46.060 --> 34:51.293
Yeah, for real. Punchy it is. It's easy to
remember, it's not that hard to spell.

34:51.465 --> 34:54.866
And once it's in your brain, you never
forget it. Punchy. Very good.

34:55.034 --> 34:57.697
- All right, man.
- Good call.

34:57.871 --> 35:01.034
All right, Punchy. You ready
to get bailed out, my friend?

35:01.308 --> 35:03.173
Okay.

35:04.278 --> 35:06.143
Hey, you know
it was a joke, don't you?

35:06.313 --> 35:09.077
Yeah, I know.
You're a very funny guy.

35:43.884 --> 35:45.511
Rocky?

35:46.487 --> 35:48.614
<i>The fans let him know</i>
<i>how they feel about it.</i>

35:48.789 --> 35:51.053
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

35:52.660 --> 35:55.060
<i>This could get ugly.</i>

35:55.796 --> 35:57.286
- Rock.
- Yo, Paulie.

35:57.464 --> 36:00.399
They're gonna be talking about
that fake Looney Tune fight.

36:01.101 --> 36:03.831
Hey, come on. We're about
to serve today's special.

36:04.004 --> 36:07.462
Italian food cooked up by a bunch
of Mexicans ain't so special.

36:07.641 --> 36:09.575
Hey, yo.

36:10.911 --> 36:12.503
Hey, I skipped work for this.

36:16.417 --> 36:19.011
What an ugly dog.

36:20.254 --> 36:21.619
It's a cute dog.

36:23.891 --> 36:25.119
- Hey, Rock.
- Yeah?

36:25.292 --> 36:28.193
I'm gonna take off.
That stuff back there is pretty cool.

36:28.395 --> 36:29.760
- Oh, you like that?
- Yeah, man.

36:30.297 --> 36:32.527
- Thanks, I appreciate it.
- I'll catch you later.

36:32.700 --> 36:34.497
All right.

36:39.106 --> 36:41.301
- Who's the criminal?
- He's a nice kid.

36:41.475 --> 36:43.136
He dresses like a bum.

36:43.577 --> 36:46.137
Coming from a human hamper,
that's quite a compliment.

36:47.614 --> 36:49.104
Hide the silverware.

36:49.283 --> 36:50.841
That's nice.

36:52.786 --> 36:53.912
Hey, Spider.

36:58.726 --> 37:00.990
Didn't you knock out
that bum once?

37:01.161 --> 37:03.129
Will you give it a rest?

37:13.540 --> 37:16.839
I'm gonna be late for work for this.
Give me a break, huh?

37:17.077 --> 37:19.841
All right. Just for a few seconds.

37:20.013 --> 37:23.210
<i>In the late '60s, a simulated fight</i>
<i>took place between two legends...</i>

37:23.417 --> 37:25.817
<i>... Muhammad Ali</i>
<i>and Rocky Marciano.</i>

37:25.986 --> 37:29.752
<i>Marciano long retired,</i>
<i>and Ali unable to fight legitimately...</i>

37:29.923 --> 37:33.290
<i>... for three years for having refused</i>
<i>induction into the armed forces...</i>

37:33.460 --> 37:36.258
<i>... was in need of money,</i>
<i>and agreed to the dream match...</i>

37:36.430 --> 37:38.990
<i>... whose outcome would be</i>
<i>decided by a computer.</i>

37:39.166 --> 37:41.396
<i>It's almost 35 years</i>
<i>since Rocky Marciano...</i>

37:41.568 --> 37:43.934
<i>... won the much-disputed</i>
<i>computer decision...</i>

37:44.104 --> 37:46.800
<i>... and guess what?</i>
<i>Not much has changed.</i>

37:46.974 --> 37:49.169
<i>Last week, Rocky Balboa</i>
<i>won a decisive fight...</i>

37:49.343 --> 37:52.369
See? That's the cartoon fight
I'm telling you about.

37:52.546 --> 37:54.013
Yeah.

37:54.181 --> 37:55.648
<i>A stunning knockout.</i>

37:55.816 --> 37:58.444
<i>Keep in mind, this is taking</i>
<i>the human factor out of it.</i>

37:58.652 --> 38:00.449
- <i>The computer says Balboa...</i>
- Beautiful.

38:00.621 --> 38:05.422
<i>... would be triumphant, KO 13.</i>
<i>And here's some of the fallout:</i>

38:05.592 --> 38:07.787
<i>What started as a simple</i>
<i>form of entertainment...</i>

38:07.961 --> 38:10.259
<i>... has become a rallying cry</i>
<i>for people who think...</i>

38:10.430 --> 38:13.194
<i>... an old-school athlete like Balboa</i>
<i>could actually be better.</i>

38:13.367 --> 38:17.098
<i>Computer technology has to create</i>
<i>what isn't. That's just not responsible.</i>

38:17.271 --> 38:19.239
Get therapy, will you?

38:19.406 --> 38:21.931
<i>How do you think Balboa</i>
<i>would have done against Dixon?</i>

38:22.109 --> 38:25.272
<i>Badly. Personally, I think Balboa</i>
<i>was completely overrated.</i>

38:25.445 --> 38:27.276
<i>He owns a restaurant</i>
<i>in South Philly.</i>

38:27.447 --> 38:29.415
<i>What's the specialty,</i>
<i>pounded chicken?</i>

38:29.583 --> 38:33.041
<i>Anyway, I would have paid to see</i>
<i>the fight. Next topic, NAS CAR...</i>

38:33.220 --> 38:35.120
<i>... and the controversy</i>
<i>that won't go away.</i>

38:35.289 --> 38:37.689
<i>Let's go back to Sunday's race...</i>

38:37.858 --> 38:39.519
Hey, hey, hey, cheer up.

38:39.693 --> 38:43.220
It's free advertisement.
Come on. Meat house calls.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.037
Yo, Robert.

38:57.578 --> 38:59.170
What are you doing out so late?

38:59.346 --> 39:01.906
I tried calling,
but nothing was picking up.

39:02.082 --> 39:04.312
- Is something wrong?
- I just wanted to come by...

39:04.484 --> 39:06.475
...and see you in person.
- Wanna come inside?

39:06.653 --> 39:09.451
No. I just wanna get
your opinion on something.

39:10.090 --> 39:11.557
Sure. Opinion on what?

39:11.725 --> 39:14.091
You know, they say you only
go around once, right?

39:14.261 --> 39:16.491
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- Well...

39:16.663 --> 39:19.154
...I think I wanna, like,
do something.

39:19.333 --> 39:22.234
- Like what?
- Fight.

39:23.036 --> 39:26.631
You know, nothing big.
Small stuff, like locally. You know.

39:28.542 --> 39:31.375
Don't you think you're too,
you know, old?

39:31.912 --> 39:33.846
You think you ought to
stop trying things...

39:34.014 --> 39:36.482
...because you had a few
too many birthdays? I do not.

39:36.650 --> 39:38.083
People will think you're crazy.

39:38.252 --> 39:42.154
What's crazy about standing
toe to toe saying, "I am," you know?

39:42.422 --> 39:43.946
That's just ego talking.

39:45.492 --> 39:48.154
What are you trying to prove
to other people, Pop?

39:49.162 --> 39:51.653
Prove? Listen, I stopped thinking...

39:51.832 --> 39:53.925
...the way other people think
a long time ago.

39:54.101 --> 39:55.796
You gotta think like you think.

39:57.638 --> 40:01.369
- I do.
- Do you? Good.

40:01.541 --> 40:06.103
You gotta face reality, okay?
It's a different world now.

40:06.980 --> 40:09.346
Only the clothes is different.

40:11.351 --> 40:14.343
I really don't know
what you want from me.

40:14.721 --> 40:19.681
I just wanted us to get involved.
You know, like, home team.

40:21.728 --> 40:27.189
Look, whatever it is, whatever
you're going through, it'll pass.

40:27.401 --> 40:29.392
Yeah, you're probably right.

40:29.569 --> 40:32.129
Time is gonna catch up to all of us.

40:32.372 --> 40:35.637
- Especially if you're standing still.
- Hey, come on.

40:38.512 --> 40:40.810
Look, I'm gonna call you
in the morning.

40:43.750 --> 40:46.218
- <i>Did you tell this to your kid?</i>
- <i>Yeah, I did.</i>

40:46.386 --> 40:48.547
- <i>What'd he think, you're nuts, right?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

40:48.722 --> 40:54.456
Oh, well, he don't believe in you?
Welcome to my world, buddy.

40:54.628 --> 40:57.859
Rocko, nobody's giving you
no title shot.

40:58.031 --> 41:00.431
I know that. I don't want one.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.000
So this isn't a mental disturbance?

41:04.171 --> 41:05.536
No.

41:05.739 --> 41:08.731
You're mad because
they took down your statue?

41:09.343 --> 41:11.174
No.

41:12.012 --> 41:13.570
Not really, no.

41:13.780 --> 41:18.877
If it's about money, just hang a sign
around your neck saying, "Punch me."

41:19.052 --> 41:22.021
Five dollars, you'll make big money.

41:23.724 --> 41:26.158
What? You haven't peaked yet?

41:27.060 --> 41:29.460
- Peaked?
- Yeah, peaked.

41:29.896 --> 41:32.387
I don't know. There's still
some stuff in the basement.

41:33.467 --> 41:36.197
- What basement?
- In here.

41:37.037 --> 41:38.698
Tell me about the stuff.

41:40.007 --> 41:43.443
- What about it?
- Tell me about the stuff inside.

41:43.610 --> 41:46.044
- Is it angry?
- Angry?

41:46.213 --> 41:48.306
Are you mad because
Adrian left you?

41:48.482 --> 41:51.076
She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.

41:51.251 --> 41:53.048
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

41:57.557 --> 42:01.288
You know, sometimes
it's hard to breathe.

42:01.461 --> 42:05.192
You know, I feel, like,
this beast inside me.

42:05.499 --> 42:08.161
It's okay, Rocko. Please, it's okay.

42:08.335 --> 42:11.736
Is it okay?

42:17.077 --> 42:20.672
I just never knew it was
supposed to be this hard.

42:20.847 --> 42:23.816
It wasn't supposed to be like this,
Paulie. You know, it...

42:33.794 --> 42:35.955
So you wanna come by
and help me train?

42:36.129 --> 42:37.562
I got a job here.

42:37.998 --> 42:39.556
I understand.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.867
Remember you said if you stay
one place long enough...

42:43.036 --> 42:44.367
...you become that place?

42:45.038 --> 42:47.302
Rocko, this is all I got.

42:47.741 --> 42:50.266
I understand, Paulie. I do.

42:54.848 --> 42:58.841
If you get time and come down
and see me train, I'd appreciate it.

42:59.820 --> 43:01.811
Of course, Rocko.

43:04.958 --> 43:06.653
Bye, Paulie.

43:06.893 --> 43:07.327
Goodbye, Rocko.

43:07.327 --> 43:08.954
Goodbye, Rocko.

43:11.631 --> 43:13.656
Take care, Rocko.

43:18.972 --> 43:22.601
<i>This plenary session of the</i>
<i>Pennsylvania Athletic Commission...</i>

43:22.776 --> 43:28.339
...is convened in order to consider
the application of Rocky Balboa...

43:28.515 --> 43:32.747
...for the issuance of a discretionary
professional boxing license...

43:32.919 --> 43:37.720
...due to his ineligibility to be
licensed as a matter of right.

43:37.891 --> 43:41.850
Mr. Balboa, you're welcome here.
Since you're representing yourself...

43:42.028 --> 43:45.156
...we invite you to make an opening
statement, if you'd like to.

43:45.332 --> 43:47.892
No, I was just curious how I did,
that's all.

43:48.068 --> 43:52.596
All right, well, the Medical
Advisory Board has informed us...

43:52.772 --> 43:55.707
...that the battery of tests
to which you've been subjected...

43:55.876 --> 43:59.141
...you've passed these tests
with flying colors.

43:59.379 --> 44:01.904
And we congratulate you for that.

44:02.082 --> 44:04.983
- Thanks.
- However, this commission...

44:05.152 --> 44:08.918
...in good conscience,
cannot recommend you for a license...

44:09.322 --> 44:12.519
...and we therefore deny
your application.

44:13.860 --> 44:16.658
- Didn't I do what you asked?
- Yes, you did.

44:16.830 --> 44:18.525
So I should get a license, right?

44:18.865 --> 44:20.059
Not exactly.

44:23.069 --> 44:26.596
So why did you give me all them tests
if you was never passing me?

44:26.773 --> 44:28.741
We've gotta stand by
our decision here...

44:28.909 --> 44:32.276
...and we have to deny your request
for a license at this time.

44:44.558 --> 44:47.152
Yo, don't I got some rights?

44:47.327 --> 44:49.420
What rights do you think
you're referring to?

44:49.596 --> 44:52.258
Like in that official paper
they wrote down the street?

44:52.432 --> 44:54.366
- That's the Bill of Rights.
- Bill of Rights.

44:54.534 --> 44:56.764
Don't it say something about going
after what makes you happy?

44:56.937 --> 44:59.701
No, that's "the pursuit of happiness."
But what's your point?

44:59.873 --> 45:03.138
My point is I'm pursuing something,
and nobody looks too happy about it.

45:03.443 --> 45:05.809
But we're just looking out
for your interests.

45:05.979 --> 45:09.642
I appreciate that, but maybe you're
looking out for your interests more.

45:09.816 --> 45:13.149
You shouldn't ask people to come here
and pay the freight on something.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.483
They pay, it still ain't good enough.
You think that's right?

45:16.656 --> 45:19.921
Maybe you're doing your job, but why
you gotta stop me from doing mine?

45:20.460 --> 45:24.328
If you're willing to go through all the
battling to get where you want to get...

45:24.497 --> 45:26.226
...who's got the right to stop you?

45:26.399 --> 45:29.835
Maybe you got something you never
finished, something you wanna do.

45:30.003 --> 45:32.233
Something you never said
to somebody, something!

45:32.405 --> 45:34.532
And you're told no,
even after you pay your dues.

45:34.708 --> 45:37.302
Who's got the right
to tell you that? Who? Nobody!

45:37.477 --> 45:40.640
It's your right to listen to your gut.
It's nobody's right to say no...

45:40.814 --> 45:44.215
...after you earn the right to be what you
wanna be or do what you wanna do!

45:48.455 --> 45:52.551
The older I get, the more things
I gotta leave behind. That's life.

45:52.726 --> 45:57.288
The only thing I'm asking you guys
to leave on the table is what's right.

46:14.714 --> 46:16.511
Yo! Have you seen
the paper today?

46:16.683 --> 46:18.810
Front row. Front row.

46:20.153 --> 46:21.211
That is so great.

46:21.421 --> 46:23.912
- All right, all right.
- Let's go get some food. Food.

46:24.090 --> 46:27.924
- Let's get a beer. Come on.
- Come on.

46:28.395 --> 46:30.454
The last two pay-per-views
were in the toilet.

46:30.630 --> 46:33.224
You're not making
heavyweight-championship money.

46:33.400 --> 46:35.368
There's a bunch of nobodies
out there, Mase.

46:35.535 --> 46:38.561
I wanna talk to you about an
opportunity we should run with.

46:38.738 --> 46:42.572
Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa
applied for a license and got one?

46:42.742 --> 46:44.642
- I heard. Forget about him.
- Hear me out.

46:44.811 --> 46:48.178
You want me to fight a guy I can beat
with both hands tied behind my back.

46:48.348 --> 46:51.715
Everybody knows you could beat him
sitting down. That's not what it's about.

46:51.885 --> 46:55.150
It's about making money. We gotta
capitalize on that computer fight.

46:55.322 --> 46:58.052
This could do a million buys.
That's 15, 20 million to you.

46:58.224 --> 47:00.215
- Forget it.
- No one's beating the door down...

47:00.393 --> 47:03.055
...to watch you fight anymore.
- We got guaranteed fights.

47:03.229 --> 47:06.198
You wanna do this now in front
of your friends, we'll do it now.

47:06.366 --> 47:09.824
We got nothing. All the pay-per-view
fights you come up with got rejected.

47:10.003 --> 47:13.530
You know why? They're all bums
out there. Nobody cares about them.

47:13.940 --> 47:17.671
There's no marquee value.
But this Balboa thing is interesting.

47:17.977 --> 47:19.535
- I don't wanna do it.
- Listen to me.

47:19.713 --> 47:23.615
It's a has-been, never-gonna-be world.
Call it nostalgia, whatever you want...

47:23.783 --> 47:26.980
...but people relate to that stuff.
This is a no-lose. It's all good.

47:27.454 --> 47:30.048
- Good for who?
- For you! Not for me! For you!

47:30.390 --> 47:33.325
Maybe you don't understand.
People don't like you no more.

47:33.493 --> 47:36.951
They don't follow you. They're not
supporting you anymore. Understand?

47:37.130 --> 47:39.257
Don't look at me like
I'm messing with your legacy.

47:39.432 --> 47:41.161
Every jock now thinks
they got a legacy.

47:41.334 --> 47:44.269
A legacy is what you get instead
of getting paid. That's a legacy.

47:44.437 --> 47:46.997
- Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
- I'm not no more.

47:47.173 --> 47:50.734
Everybody knows you could kick
this old man's ass. But you don't.

47:50.910 --> 47:52.935
Leave him with a little
dignity, so they say:

47:53.113 --> 47:56.605
"Mason Dixon's got compassion.
He's a decent guy, he's a nice guy."

47:56.783 --> 47:59.183
You get a whole new audience,
we'll double your money.

47:59.352 --> 48:01.411
You want a new image?
That's how you get it.

48:01.588 --> 48:03.317
To replace the one
that you two made?

48:03.490 --> 48:06.323
Whoa, wait. We made your
world green. You made the rest.

48:06.493 --> 48:08.461
This is you.
You made all this junk happen.

48:08.628 --> 48:10.323
I've had it up to here with this mess.

48:10.497 --> 48:12.988
Time for me to make changes.
I'm going to Martin's gym.

48:13.166 --> 48:14.895
- We'll talk about it.
- Forget this crap.

48:15.068 --> 48:17.434
I want Martin back.
There's nothing to talk about.

48:28.148 --> 48:29.911
- How you doing?
- Hey, what a surprise.

48:30.083 --> 48:32.483
I was driving around
the neighborhood, I thought...

48:32.652 --> 48:35.280
...why not drive by and say hello?
- You wanna come inside?

48:35.455 --> 48:38.481
No, the dog needs some exercise.
You wanna take a little walk?

48:38.658 --> 48:41.058
- Yeah, yeah. All right.
- It's nice outside.

48:41.227 --> 48:43.787
- All right.
- Nice and brisk.

48:43.963 --> 48:45.157
When did you get a dog?

48:45.331 --> 48:47.424
We picked up Punchy
a couple of days back.

48:47.600 --> 48:48.794
- Punchy?
- Yeah.

48:48.968 --> 48:50.196
You named your dog Punchy?

48:50.370 --> 48:52.065
Your kid come up with the name.

48:52.238 --> 48:54.672
Oh, yeah?
I think that's disrespectful.

48:54.841 --> 48:56.604
Oh, no, no. It's fine, really.

48:56.776 --> 49:00.075
No, it's easy to remember
and it's all that, you know.

49:00.246 --> 49:03.238
Listen, what do you think about
coming over to the restaurant?

49:03.416 --> 49:06.442
- What for?
- Well, you know, for, like...

49:06.619 --> 49:10.055
For work. The hostess is gonna
be having a kid. You'd do good.

49:10.223 --> 49:12.748
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you, you'd do so good.

49:12.926 --> 49:15.394
I appreciate what you're doing
for my kid, but I can't.

49:15.562 --> 49:18.030
Hey, listen, I think you'd like it a lot.

49:18.198 --> 49:20.632
It's a nice environment,
it's very pleasant.

49:20.800 --> 49:22.859
Yeah, can we drop it?

49:25.338 --> 49:26.828
What's bothering you?

49:27.006 --> 49:29.236
Nothing. It's all right.
Listen, I gotta get back.

49:30.677 --> 49:32.611
- No, it ain't all right.
- Oh, come on.

49:32.946 --> 49:34.811
- What?
- I'm gonna be the first person...

49:34.981 --> 49:37.415
...people see when they walk in?
- You give out menus.

49:37.584 --> 49:40.348
You say, "Hello, how are you?"
You sit people down.

49:40.520 --> 49:42.784
Look, if I can do it,
anybody can do it.

49:42.956 --> 49:46.221
You could find 10 better people,
a hundred better people for this job.

49:46.392 --> 49:48.223
Give it a try, like two weeks.

49:48.394 --> 49:50.191
I don't wanna try.

49:50.363 --> 49:52.593
- Who put this stuff in your head?
- Nobody.

49:52.765 --> 49:54.756
Well, it just don't
get in there by itself.

49:58.338 --> 50:00.272
Thanks for coming by.

50:02.175 --> 50:06.669
Yo, when was the last time you
went dancing? Has it been a while?

50:06.846 --> 50:08.711
- Why are you asking?
- I'm asking because...

50:08.882 --> 50:12.147
...you dance around these problems,
you might as well dance with me.

50:12.318 --> 50:15.344
I ain't that good,
but I'm better than the average bear.

50:15.522 --> 50:18.184
Where that came from, I don't know.

50:18.825 --> 50:20.292
- You're crazy.
- A little bit.

50:20.460 --> 50:23.725
But the way you're thinking
and talking, it's a little crazy too.

50:24.597 --> 50:28.226
Come on, you deserve better.
Really. Come on over.

50:28.401 --> 50:32.633
I need you to class my place up.
Philly needs you.

50:33.006 --> 50:36.669
And if you say, "Screw you, creepo"
again, I totally understand.

50:36.843 --> 50:39.277
But I'm warning you,
I'm gonna put myself...

50:39.445 --> 50:41.310
...in the middle of the street here...

50:41.481 --> 50:44.416
...and stand here, me and Punchy,
and wave to the first bus, say:

50:44.584 --> 50:46.313
"Come on over here and mash me!

50:46.486 --> 50:48.954
Little Marie turned down
the job at the restaurant.

50:49.122 --> 50:50.817
She thinks she's better than us."

50:50.990 --> 50:54.255
Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been
a bus down here in 20 years.

50:54.894 --> 50:56.885
- Yeah?
- No.

50:58.965 --> 51:00.592
That was a close call.

51:01.668 --> 51:06.662
Listen, seriously. Come on over.
It'd be nice.

51:09.309 --> 51:10.742
All right.

51:28.995 --> 51:30.553
Paulie!

51:33.900 --> 51:35.697
Sorry, Paulie.

51:37.103 --> 51:38.798
Sorry.

52:10.069 --> 52:13.197
How are you?
Get my unusual up there.

52:13.373 --> 52:16.137
Excuse me.
Deliveries are in the back.

52:16.309 --> 52:18.004
I'm not a delivery guy.

52:18.177 --> 52:19.974
Well, do you have a reservation?

52:20.146 --> 52:22.876
Do I look like a freaking Indian?

52:25.852 --> 52:28.150
Hey, Rock? Rocky?

52:33.059 --> 52:35.823
I think we've got a little bit
of a problem with this guy.

52:35.995 --> 52:38.327
Problem?
No, no, he's just a relative.

52:38.498 --> 52:40.762
Oh, okay.

52:43.302 --> 52:44.735
Yo, Paulie.

52:47.006 --> 52:48.997
- What happened to your eye?
- I hit it.

52:49.308 --> 52:51.105
- Why?
- Needed to.

52:51.744 --> 52:53.075
What happened?

52:53.246 --> 52:55.976
- I'm celebrating, Rock.
- Why?

52:56.149 --> 52:58.583
- I retired.
- Retired?

53:04.424 --> 53:07.018
So when did they start
giving retired people meat...

53:07.193 --> 53:09.354
...instead of watches, Paulie?

53:12.165 --> 53:14.133
I don't need a watch.

53:15.968 --> 53:19.369
I got a watch! You gave me a watch!

53:19.572 --> 53:20.834
Paulie...

53:21.007 --> 53:23.532
I don't need no goddamn watch.

53:25.178 --> 53:28.306
- Yo, Paulie.
- I got a watch!

53:29.615 --> 53:31.606
I got two watches!

53:32.085 --> 53:34.246
Yo, Paulie!

53:46.599 --> 53:47.623
Yo, Paulie.

53:49.268 --> 53:50.758
Rock.

53:51.070 --> 53:55.473
It takes guts climbing back in that ring,
knowing you're gonna take a beating.

53:58.177 --> 54:00.077
You're gonna do all right, Rocko.

54:00.346 --> 54:01.677
How do you know that?

54:03.583 --> 54:06.143
The stuff in the basement.

54:17.130 --> 54:18.859
Thanks, Paulie.

54:23.669 --> 54:26.570
- Hey.
- Hey, Rock, how are you?

54:27.940 --> 54:30.067
- You okay?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

54:30.243 --> 54:31.870
- Yeah, fine. This is great.
- Good.

54:32.044 --> 54:34.706
Listen, some guys over there
wanna talk to you.

54:34.881 --> 54:37.679
- Okay. You got it.
- Okay?

54:41.120 --> 54:43.816
- Thanks for coming by. I appreciate it.
- Our pleasure.

54:43.990 --> 54:45.981
- Wanna hear stories?
- What kind of stories?

54:46.192 --> 54:48.888
Well, a lot of people like to hear
these old fight stories.

54:49.061 --> 54:50.528
- Maybe later.
- Okay.

54:50.696 --> 54:55.156
I'm Lou DiBella. This is L.C. Luco.
He's Mason Dixon's manager.

54:55.368 --> 54:57.768
- Will you sit down and join us?
- Sure.

54:59.338 --> 55:02.136
You know, we have the promotional
contract for Mason Dixon...

55:02.308 --> 55:03.832
...who's a big fan.
- Really?

55:04.010 --> 55:06.137
When he heard you were
interested in fighting...

55:06.312 --> 55:08.542
...he thought why not try
to work something out?

55:08.714 --> 55:11.740
Like a special event.
Like a first-class exhibition fight.

55:13.286 --> 55:15.379
- Why me?
- He respects the hell out of you.

55:15.555 --> 55:19.514
All right? And let's be honest,
that computer fight got people curious.

55:19.692 --> 55:22.126
- This could be very interesting.
- I ain't interested...

55:22.295 --> 55:24.422
...in getting, like,
mangled and embarrassed.

55:24.597 --> 55:26.758
No, that's not gonna happen.
Never happen.

55:26.933 --> 55:31.097
Truthfully, I was thinking
more on a, like...

55:31.504 --> 55:35.099
...miniscule, small level.
You know. Small fights, not big fights.

55:35.374 --> 55:39.310
Small fights. Things that...
Local. You know what I mean?

55:39.478 --> 55:43.005
Not a bad idea. Don't think of it as big.
Think of it like an exhibition.

55:43.182 --> 55:46.743
Think of it as a glorified sparring
session. Here's something you'll like.

55:46.919 --> 55:49.444
We're gonna donate a portion
of the gate to charity.

55:49.622 --> 55:51.715
- That's always nice.
- It's good to give.

55:51.891 --> 55:53.358
Yeah.

55:53.793 --> 55:55.385
Where's it taking place?

55:55.561 --> 55:56.926
- Las Vegas.
- Las Vegas.

55:57.096 --> 56:00.327
Nice and warm.
This cold's gotta be killing you.

56:00.533 --> 56:02.899
- Little stiff.
- You move better when you're warmer.

56:03.502 --> 56:05.129
- Yeah.
- And if nothing else...

56:05.304 --> 56:07.397
...you'll have new stories to tell.

56:07.673 --> 56:10.506
- I really gotta think about this.
- Absolutely.

56:10.676 --> 56:13.076
- Is that okay?
- I understand. No problem.

56:13.446 --> 56:15.641
I'm gonna go over there.
You can order something.

56:15.815 --> 56:17.908
- What do you recommend?
- It's all edible.

56:20.820 --> 56:23.414
Okay. Thanks.

56:24.023 --> 56:27.857
We got him. Imagine if Dixon
met this bastard in his prime?

56:28.027 --> 56:30.495
- He'd kill him. Kill him.
- You ain't kidding.

56:31.030 --> 56:33.396
Man, I'm confused.

56:40.606 --> 56:42.506
I didn't think this was gonna
come along.

56:42.675 --> 56:44.302
But this is what you wanted, right?

56:44.477 --> 56:46.775
I don't know.
You know, I talk and I talk.

56:46.946 --> 56:49.039
Sometimes I think
what I'm saying is true...

56:49.215 --> 56:53.549
...and then I look at myself and I'm
not even sure what is true anymore.

56:53.719 --> 56:56.711
Because it's like, I pushed
this crazy idea about fighting.

56:56.889 --> 56:58.447
I mean, what's it all about?

56:58.624 --> 57:01.559
Do I really care about standing
toe to toe and all that stuff...

57:01.727 --> 57:05.322
...or, like my kid says,
is it just, like, ego?

57:05.498 --> 57:09.264
Or am I this old pug who's just trying
to replace old pain with new pain?

57:09.435 --> 57:12.029
I don't know. I don't know.

57:13.806 --> 57:16.570
Look, I know
I usually don't say a lot.

57:16.742 --> 57:20.803
I'm always listening and looking.

57:20.980 --> 57:25.917
But who you are, the part of you
that's so full of life...

57:26.085 --> 57:28.144
...we all have that feeling, that fire...

57:28.321 --> 57:32.815
...but usually never get a chance
to use it. And then it just goes away.

57:32.992 --> 57:37.929
But you can. You've got this
opportunity, so do it. Why not?

57:38.097 --> 57:42.397
I mean, this is who you are.
This is who you'll always be.

57:42.568 --> 57:45.867
And you don't move aside for nobody
until you're ready to move.

57:46.038 --> 57:48.836
And it doesn't matter
how this looks to other people.

57:49.008 --> 57:51.306
All that matters
is how it looks to you.

57:53.479 --> 57:55.003
Rocky.

57:56.215 --> 57:58.206
Rocky, look at me.

57:59.318 --> 58:02.754
How it looks to you.

58:03.756 --> 58:05.747
And if this is something
that you wanna do...

58:05.925 --> 58:09.952
...and if this is something that
you gotta do, then you do it.

58:11.364 --> 58:13.025
Fighters fight.

58:16.769 --> 58:19.203
You're not gonna punch me,
are you?

58:22.808 --> 58:26.437
Listen, I gotta go before I wear out
my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.

58:27.913 --> 58:29.210
Thanks.

58:40.059 --> 58:42.357
Fighters fight, right?

58:48.601 --> 58:52.560
It's rare when you get to promote
an event bigger than boxing. This is.

58:52.738 --> 58:56.504
Skill versus will, with part
of the proceeds going to charity.

58:56.675 --> 59:00.873
The brainchild of Mason Dixon,
to honor past heavyweight champions.

59:01.047 --> 59:04.278
Warriors like Rocky Balboa.
Let's open it up for questions.

59:04.450 --> 59:05.644
Hey, champ!

59:05.818 --> 59:09.811
A few great fighters have fought in
their 50s, often with disastrous results.

59:09.989 --> 59:11.650
Why risk the danger
and embarrassment?

59:11.824 --> 59:14.258
The smart money says
you have virtually no chance.

59:14.427 --> 59:18.488
A puncher always has a chance.
This fight will be competitive.

59:19.932 --> 59:21.923
Why are you doing this, Rocky?

59:22.101 --> 59:26.265
<i>I don't know, I'd rather do</i>
<i>something I love badly than...</i>

59:26.439 --> 59:31.035
<i>Than to feel bad by not</i>
<i>doing something you love.</i>

59:31.811 --> 59:34.473
Rocky, the press has labeled you
a Balboasaurus.

59:36.348 --> 59:38.009
How do you feel about that?

59:38.184 --> 59:42.143
Let's say the following happens:
You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.

59:42.321 --> 59:45.813
You lose, say a thumb in the eye,
you'll be the joke of the decade.

59:45.991 --> 59:49.392
You all know that will never happen.
This is only an exhibition.

59:49.562 --> 59:52.998
Don't go trying to make more out
of this than that computer tried.

59:54.867 --> 59:58.462
Isn't this sport in enough trouble
without these circus events?

59:58.771 --> 01:00:01.069
- Next question.
- On the surface, this looks like...

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.640
...a cheap bit of ring theater
between, no offense...

01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:06.334
...a has-been and a man
whose own credible legacy...

01:00:06.512 --> 01:00:08.002
...and popularity is in doubt.

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.807
- What's the upside?
- Doubt?

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:12.507
Upside? I mean...

01:00:12.685 --> 01:00:16.348
What do you mean, upside?
I mean, what do I have to do?

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:19.854
You know, I'm 33-0
with 30 knockouts.

01:00:20.126 --> 01:00:23.061
I'm doing you people a favor.
I'm having this exhibition for you.

01:00:23.229 --> 01:00:26.221
You gonna get up here and make
a mockery out of me? I'm the champ.

01:00:26.899 --> 01:00:29.060
I mean, I get pissed,
this guy get hurt.

01:00:30.002 --> 01:00:31.663
See you at the fight.

01:00:35.774 --> 01:00:38.038
The guy's a joke.
He's gonna get crushed.

01:00:47.786 --> 01:00:49.515
- Look who's here.
- How you doing?

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:51.952
- Have you seen my father?
- He's in the back.

01:00:52.124 --> 01:00:54.957
This place has never served
this many meals. It's unbelievable.

01:00:55.127 --> 01:00:59.223
You're doing good? Hope you're
enjoying everything, all right?

01:01:01.467 --> 01:01:02.991
Excuse me.

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:08.231
How you doing? Glad you come by.

01:01:08.807 --> 01:01:09.933
Can I talk with you?

01:01:10.242 --> 01:01:12.733
- Sure.
- Can we do it outside?

01:01:17.583 --> 01:01:20.416
- So you're going through with this?
- I start training tomorrow.

01:01:20.586 --> 01:01:23.817
Hey, Rock.
I made some connections.

01:01:23.989 --> 01:01:26.355
I can make some money
on this, endorsements.

01:01:27.526 --> 01:01:28.720
Absolutely. Do that.

01:01:29.128 --> 01:01:31.562
- Thank you, Rock. Okay.
- Sure.

01:01:32.264 --> 01:01:35.665
- So you nervous about the fight?
- Scared to death.

01:01:35.834 --> 01:01:38.564
- You don't look scared.
- Well, I ain't supposed to.

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:41.137
Then you don't have to do it.

01:01:41.307 --> 01:01:43.605
Yeah, well, I think I do.

01:01:46.712 --> 01:01:49.875
You know, living with you,
it hasn't been easy.

01:01:50.049 --> 01:01:52.677
People see me
but they think of you.

01:01:52.851 --> 01:01:55.684
Now with all this going on,
it's gonna be worse than ever.

01:01:55.854 --> 01:01:57.788
- It don't have to be.
- Sure it does!

01:01:57.957 --> 01:02:00.687
- Why? You've got a lot going on, kid.
- What, my last name?

01:02:00.859 --> 01:02:02.793
That's the reason I got a decent job.

01:02:02.962 --> 01:02:05.157
That's why people deal with me
in the first place.

01:02:05.331 --> 01:02:06.992
Now I start to get a little ahead...

01:02:07.166 --> 01:02:11.102
...I start to get a little something
for myself, and this happens.

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:14.535
Now, I'm asking you as a favor
not to go through with this.

01:02:14.707 --> 01:02:17.870
This is gonna end up bad for you,
and it's gonna end up bad for me.

01:02:18.043 --> 01:02:20.773
- You think I'm hurting you?
- Yeah. In a way, you are.

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:22.978
That's the last thing
I ever wanted to do.

01:02:23.148 --> 01:02:26.584
I know that's not what you wanna do,
but that's just the way that it is.

01:02:26.752 --> 01:02:29.846
Don't you care what people think?
Doesn't it bother you that people...

01:02:30.022 --> 01:02:33.082
...are making you out to be a joke
and that I'll be included in that?

01:02:33.259 --> 01:02:36.285
Do you think that's right? Do you?

01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:47.238
You ain't gonna believe this,
but you used to fit right here.

01:02:47.406 --> 01:02:49.636
I'd hold you up
and say to your mother:

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:52.368
"This kid is gonna be
the best kid in the world.

01:02:52.544 --> 01:02:55.775
This kid is gonna be somebody
better than anybody ever knew."

01:02:55.948 --> 01:02:58.781
And you grew up
good and wonderful.

01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:02.079
It was great just watching,
every day was like a privilege.

01:03:02.254 --> 01:03:05.451
Then the time come for you to be
your own man and take on the world...

01:03:05.624 --> 01:03:10.152
...and you did. But somewhere
along the line, you changed.

01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:11.591
You stopped being you.

01:03:11.764 --> 01:03:15.063
You let people stick a finger in
your face and tell you you're no good.

01:03:15.234 --> 01:03:18.897
And when things got hard, you started
looking for something to blame...

01:03:19.071 --> 01:03:21.164
...like a big shadow.

01:03:22.641 --> 01:03:24.905
Let me tell you something
you already know.

01:03:25.077 --> 01:03:27.409
The world ain't all
sunshine and rainbows.

01:03:27.579 --> 01:03:31.413
It's a very mean and nasty place,
and I don't care how tough you are...

01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:35.178
...it will beat you to your knees
and keep you there if you let it.

01:03:35.821 --> 01:03:39.814
You, me or nobody
is gonna hit as hard as life.

01:03:39.992 --> 01:03:44.122
But it ain't about how hard you hit.
It's about how hard you can get hit...

01:03:44.296 --> 01:03:45.695
...and keep moving forward.

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:49.061
How much you can take
and keep moving forward.

01:03:49.234 --> 01:03:51.634
That's how winning is done!

01:03:52.104 --> 01:03:54.834
If you know what you're worth,
go and get what you're worth.

01:03:55.007 --> 01:03:58.272
But you gotta be willing to take
the hits, and not pointing fingers...

01:03:58.444 --> 01:04:02.540
...saying you ain't where you wanna be
because of him or her or anybody!

01:04:02.715 --> 01:04:06.947
Cowards do that, and that ain't you!
You're better than that!

01:04:13.692 --> 01:04:17.025
I'm always gonna love you
no matter what.

01:04:17.196 --> 01:04:19.061
No matter what happens.

01:04:19.431 --> 01:04:22.229
You're my son and you're my blood.

01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:25.165
You're the best thing in my life.

01:04:26.405 --> 01:04:30.273
But until you start believing in
yourself, you ain't gonna have a life.

01:04:35.114 --> 01:04:37.605
Don't forget to visit your mother.

01:05:27.499 --> 01:05:30.127
- Yeah, those are beautiful.
- Yeah.

01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:35.164
- You get off early from work?
- No.

01:05:35.607 --> 01:05:37.097
I left.

01:05:37.743 --> 01:05:39.267
I quit.

01:05:40.045 --> 01:05:41.342
Quit, why?

01:05:42.748 --> 01:05:45.114
I wasn't very...

01:05:45.751 --> 01:05:48.879
I don't know, I just...
I didn't fit in there.

01:05:50.923 --> 01:05:52.356
I understand.

01:05:57.029 --> 01:06:00.294
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Right now?

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.394
Right now I'd rather be with you.

01:06:06.738 --> 01:06:08.535
Is that all right?

01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:11.672
Yeah.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.843
It's been a long time
since I seen a fight.

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:26.758
You know all there is
to know about fighting...

01:06:26.758 --> 01:06:28.919
You know all there is
to know about fighting...

01:06:29.094 --> 01:06:32.257
...so there's no sense us going down
that same old road again.

01:06:32.431 --> 01:06:36.561
To beat this guy, you need speed.
You don't have it.

01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:42.006
And your knees can't take the
pounding, so hard running is out.

01:06:42.174 --> 01:06:45.905
And you got arthritis in your neck.
And you've got calcium deposits...

01:06:46.078 --> 01:06:49.377
...on most of your joints,
so sparring is out.

01:06:50.315 --> 01:06:51.782
I had that problem.

01:06:52.684 --> 01:06:57.883
So what we'll be calling on is good
old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:02.720
Horsepower. Heavy-duty,
cast-iron, pile-driving punches...

01:07:02.895 --> 01:07:05.921
...that will have to hurt so much
they'll rattle his ancestors.

01:07:06.498 --> 01:07:08.227
Every time you hit him with a shot...

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.369
...it's gotta feel like he tried kissing
the express train.

01:07:12.704 --> 01:07:16.640
Yeah! Let's start building
some hurting bombs.

01:07:48.941 --> 01:07:51.774
- Yeah, you'll get it.
- You can do it, Rocko!

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.203
Getting stronger!

01:08:31.617 --> 01:08:33.345
- Up! Up! Up!
- Come on!

01:08:35.287 --> 01:08:36.549
Go!

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.493
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:08:47.232 --> 01:08:48.631
Come on, Rocko!

01:08:56.041 --> 01:08:58.339
Come on. Come on.
Let's hit them. Hit them.

01:09:03.881 --> 01:09:05.179
You can do it, Rock.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:09.514
Getting stronger!

01:09:20.564 --> 01:09:23.432
- Up, up, up!
- Go! Go!

01:09:24.603 --> 01:09:26.069
All right!

01:09:26.604 --> 01:09:27.867
Yeah! Yeah!

01:09:47.591 --> 01:09:49.219
Yeah!

01:09:59.004 --> 01:10:03.065
Rocky Balboa, 217!

01:10:03.809 --> 01:10:09.941
The undisputed heavyweight
champion, Mason Dixon, 221!

01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:15.943
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.724
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:34.363
- Know how much money is in this?
- A lot of it.

01:10:34.539 --> 01:10:36.905
Imagine trying to clean this place.

01:10:37.075 --> 01:10:38.474
- No, seriously.
- Balboa!

01:10:42.147 --> 01:10:44.911
You guys, I'll catch up
with you all later, okay?

01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:47.278
Robert, why don't
you hang with me?

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:51.388
- How you doing, champ?
- I'm good.

01:10:52.891 --> 01:10:55.519
No reason for neither one of us
to get hurt in this fight.

01:10:55.694 --> 01:10:58.686
I'll do my best to carry you,
make sure you save face.

01:10:58.864 --> 01:11:00.661
There'd be no embarrassment.

01:11:00.832 --> 01:11:05.132
But I promise you, you try to press me,
you hit me, you hurt me...

01:11:05.337 --> 01:11:08.864
...you hit me low, cheap-shot me,
I'll get you out of there.

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:14.472
You know, a lot of people come
to Vegas to lose. I didn't.

01:11:14.679 --> 01:11:15.976
It's already over.

01:11:16.148 --> 01:11:18.048
Ain't nothing over till it's over.

01:11:18.216 --> 01:11:19.877
What's that from, the '80s?

01:11:20.051 --> 01:11:22.417
That's probably the '70s.

01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:26.814
Just remember what I said.

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:30.351
Hey, yo, champ.

01:11:30.595 --> 01:11:32.222
Yo, ain't you a little scared?

01:11:33.198 --> 01:11:35.029
I don't get scared.

01:11:38.103 --> 01:11:40.537
I think you try a little harder
when you're scared.

01:11:41.139 --> 01:11:44.336
This is what has worked for me.

01:11:45.076 --> 01:11:47.442
- I ain't scared.
- Oh, yeah. You ain't scared of me?

01:11:47.612 --> 01:11:50.012
Come on, let's see what you got.
Come on.

01:11:50.182 --> 01:11:51.615
Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.

01:12:07.299 --> 01:12:08.994
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:12:09.167 --> 01:12:10.828
- How you doing?
- I was just thinking.

01:12:11.002 --> 01:12:13.300
- Did you wanna come in?
- No, no, no, it's okay.

01:12:13.471 --> 01:12:15.632
I just wanted to...

01:12:15.807 --> 01:12:18.605
...I don' t know, come by and wish you
good luck for tomorrow.

01:12:18.777 --> 01:12:20.608
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:12:20.779 --> 01:12:22.747
I brought you something.

01:12:22.914 --> 01:12:25.246
I hope you don't mind,
I took it from the restaurant.

01:12:25.417 --> 01:12:27.214
- No.
- Thanks.

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:29.148
Adrian.

01:12:29.321 --> 01:12:32.085
Yeah. Thought she would
keep you safe.

01:12:32.257 --> 01:12:34.691
Yeah. Yeah, she always
brought me luck.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.589
Yeah.

01:12:37.295 --> 01:12:42.358
I wanted to say thanks for everything
you've done for me and my kid.

01:12:43.134 --> 01:12:45.068
You've been great and...

01:12:49.474 --> 01:12:51.374
You know, tomorrow...

01:12:52.844 --> 01:12:56.837
...you're gonna prove that the last thing
to age on somebody is their heart.

01:12:58.884 --> 01:13:01.079
- I'll try.
- You go show them.

01:13:01.253 --> 01:13:02.914
Thank you.

01:13:24.142 --> 01:13:25.939
<i>The heavyweight championship</i>

<i>Two-time heavyweight champion</i>
<i>Rocky Balboa...</i>

01:13:32.584 --> 01:13:35.678
<i>... the Philadelphia slugger,</i>
<i>renowned for his cast-iron jaw...</i>

01:13:35.854 --> 01:13:38.618
<i>... ferocious body attack</i>
<i>and will of steel...</i>

01:13:39.124 --> 01:13:41.991
<i>... all of which have carried</i>
<i>the smaller fighter to victories...</i>

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.561
<i>... over the years against</i>
<i>physically superior opponents.</i>

01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:48.324
<i>And Mason Dixon, the current</i>
<i>heavyweight title holder...</i>

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.867
<i>... with all the speed, determination</i>
<i>and confidence any fighter could want.</i>

01:13:52.037 --> 01:13:55.996
<i>But many still question whether</i>
<i>he has the heart of a true champion...</i>

01:13:56.174 --> 01:13:59.974
<i>... never having been pushed to go</i>
<i>the distance. Tonight, we find out.</i>

01:14:01.579 --> 01:14:04.047
<i>Here at the Mandalay Bay</i>
<i>Event Center in Las Vegas...</i>

01:14:04.215 --> 01:14:06.046
<i>... for the much-anticipated</i>
<i>showdown...</i>

01:14:06.217 --> 01:14:08.151
<i>... between Mason</i>
<i>"The Line" Dixon...</i>

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.221
<i>... and Rocky</i>
<i>"The Italian Stallion" Balboa.</i>

01:14:11.723 --> 01:14:14.658
Hello, I'm Jim Lampley with
Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman...

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:18.023
...live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel
in Las Vegas, where we anticipate...

01:14:18.196 --> 01:14:21.393
...one of the most outrageous and
compelling events in boxing history.

01:14:21.566 --> 01:14:25.297
The unappreciated heavyweight
champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon...

01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:27.233
<i>... putting his reputation</i>
<i>on the line...</i>

01:14:28.573 --> 01:14:30.370
<i>... against legendary ex-champion,</i>
<i>Rocky Balboa.</i>

01:14:31.710 --> 01:14:34.770
<i>Even though most see this as more</i>
<i>of a glorified sparring session...</i>

01:14:34.946 --> 01:14:36.914
...the energy in the room is electric.

01:14:37.082 --> 01:14:39.175
Larry, why is this billed
as an exhibition?

01:14:39.351 --> 01:14:43.515
Wild guess: So they wouldn't
have to call it an execution.

01:14:44.322 --> 01:14:49.521
Zacariah 4:6 says,
"It is not by strength, not by might...

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:53.460
...but by his spirit
we have already claimed the victory...

01:14:53.631 --> 01:14:56.327
...in our Lord Jesus Christ."

01:14:56.968 --> 01:14:58.663
Good luck, Rocky.

01:14:58.837 --> 01:15:01.101
Thanks, Spider. Appreciate it.

01:15:12.217 --> 01:15:15.482
Nobody's expecting much, I think,
from the way-past-his-prime...

01:15:15.653 --> 01:15:17.746
...former champ, Rocky Balboa.

01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:21.488
Rock, I gotta talk to you.

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:28.096
Look, I know you got a lot of stuff
you gotta get out of your system.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.562
Tonight you do it. Right?
Get rid of the damn beast...

01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:38.573
...let it be done, once and for all.
Please, I love you.

01:15:39.477 --> 01:15:43.106
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:52.322
There go the lights. The buzz is
building toward a roaring crescendo.

01:16:08.239 --> 01:16:10.434
Where did that come from?

01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:13.600
I told you. I love Sinatra.

01:16:14.279 --> 01:16:16.304
He's very good, Sinatra.

01:16:16.481 --> 01:16:19.507
- Let's go.
- Very good.

01:16:21.753 --> 01:16:26.247
And here comes Rocky Balboa,
veteran of the wars...

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:29.120
...here for one more last hurrah.

01:16:29.294 --> 01:16:32.229
Or the Last Supper, perhaps,
with him as the main course.

01:16:32.397 --> 01:16:35.025
What's that music?
You can't be serious.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.930
"High Hopes"?
Talk about wishful thinking.

01:16:38.136 --> 01:16:41.594
Well, maybe no hopes is more
realistic. Anyway, the crowd likes it.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.637
Look at the Italian Stallion.
Cool and relaxed.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:49.541
Rocky's an off-the-board underdog,
and they don't care at all.

01:16:49.714 --> 01:16:53.480
This is about his pride and dignity
and his punch, guys.

01:16:53.718 --> 01:16:56.243
The last thing to go
is a guy's punch.

01:16:56.421 --> 01:16:59.879
Rocky always has
that puncher's chance.

01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:08.325
Rocky Balboa is still, as you can hear,
the people's champion.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.934
Prediction, guys:
For at least two rounds...

01:17:11.102 --> 01:17:12.831
...Dixon's gonna have
his hands full.

01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:17.031
Two whole rounds? We have
a cockeyed optimist in the house.

01:17:18.009 --> 01:17:19.840
- How you doing?
- The crowd wants to see...

01:17:20.011 --> 01:17:21.672
...something real, or at least...

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:23.871
Rocky Balboa just asked me
how I'm doing.

01:17:24.048 --> 01:17:28.712
I grew up watching this guy. I never
thought I'd be calling one of his fights.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.916
This is unbelievable.
I'm a fan, I can't help it.

01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:34.718
Now here comes Mason Dixon.

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.428
Mason Dixon establishing
his presence in the ring.

01:18:11.596 --> 01:18:15.362
And suddenly now a conversation
breaking out at ringside.

01:18:15.533 --> 01:18:18.263
Mike Tyson calling out
Mason "The Line" Dixon.

01:18:18.436 --> 01:18:20.961
You can't call no shots here.
I'm the champ.

01:18:21.139 --> 01:18:23.505
You not doing nothing.
This is charity work.

01:18:23.675 --> 01:18:26.735
You got that midget
with you right there.

01:18:31.449 --> 01:18:34.941
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Mandalay Bay...

01:18:36.554 --> 01:18:39.079
...resort and casino of Las Vegas.

01:18:39.257 --> 01:18:42.715
And a special main event
of the evening...

01:18:42.894 --> 01:18:46.193
...10 rounds of
heavyweight excitement...

01:18:46.364 --> 01:18:48.798
...sanctioned by the Nevada
State Athletic Commission.

01:18:48.967 --> 01:18:52.835
And when the bell rings, the referee
in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.

01:18:54.606 --> 01:18:57.734
And now, for the thousands
in attendance...

01:18:57.909 --> 01:19:03.643
...and the millions watching around
the world, ladies and gentlemen...

01:19:03.815 --> 01:19:09.378
...let's get ready to rumble!

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:14.952
Introducing first,
fighting out of the blue corner...

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:19.825
...wearing black with gold,
official weight, 217 pounds.

01:19:19.998 --> 01:19:24.628
His professional record, 57 victories
including 54 knockouts...

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:27.828
...with 23 defeats and one draw.

01:19:28.006 --> 01:19:31.169
He is the fighting pride
of Philadelphia...

01:19:31.442 --> 01:19:35.811
...the two-time heavyweight
champion of the world...

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:38.073
..."The Italian Stallion"...

01:19:38.249 --> 01:19:42.845
...Rocky...

01:19:43.021 --> 01:19:45.387
...Balboa!

01:19:48.426 --> 01:19:50.018
Hope he gets his head busted.

01:19:52.063 --> 01:19:53.997
Shut up.

01:19:56.768 --> 01:19:59.566
Across the ring,
fighting out of the red corner...

01:19:59.737 --> 01:20:03.537
...wearing white with blue,
official weight, 221 pounds.

01:20:03.775 --> 01:20:08.769
He has a perfect professional record,
consisting of 33 bouts...

01:20:08.946 --> 01:20:12.211
...33 victories,
including 30 knockouts.

01:20:12.383 --> 01:20:14.351
Originally from Tampa, Florida...

01:20:14.519 --> 01:20:17.545
...but now fighting out
of Las Vegas, Nevada...

01:20:17.722 --> 01:20:22.056
...the reigning undisputed,
undefeated...

01:20:22.226 --> 01:20:25.195
...heavyweight champion
of the world...

01:20:25.363 --> 01:20:28.855
...Mason "The Line"...

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:32.992
...Dixon!

01:20:37.141 --> 01:20:38.802
All right, gentlemen.

01:20:38.976 --> 01:20:42.343
All right, Mason, Rocky. We went
over the rules in the dressing room.

01:20:42.513 --> 01:20:46.540
I expect a good, clean fight. Watch
the kidney punches, rabbit punches...

01:20:46.718 --> 01:20:49.915
...low blows, be careful with those.
Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.

01:20:50.088 --> 01:20:53.785
Remember, gentlemen, I'm fair
but I'm firm. Touch them up!

01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:56.518
- Enjoy the ride.
- The champ is not in the best shape...

01:20:56.694 --> 01:20:59.993
...we've seen him in. Maybe he plans
to phone this in and go home early.

01:21:00.164 --> 01:21:02.598
- That wouldn't be a surprise.
- Glad you could make it.

01:21:02.767 --> 01:21:05.395
One thing about Rocky
we know for sure:

01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:07.800
This guy's showing up in shape.

01:21:07.972 --> 01:21:10.805
- The old man's crazy.
- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.

01:21:10.975 --> 01:21:12.909
- Okay.
- Take it easy. This is an exhibition.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:14.544
All right? Do it to him.

01:21:14.712 --> 01:21:17.909
You got three rounds to set a pace.
Every time you hit him, make a dent.

01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:20.050
- Got it.
- The moments before...

01:21:20.218 --> 01:21:23.710
...a Rocky Balboa fight?
I can't believe it's here!

01:21:24.856 --> 01:21:26.084
Round one begins.

01:21:26.257 --> 01:21:29.954
If old George Foreman shocked
the world with one punch...

01:21:30.128 --> 01:21:32.255
...why can't old Rocky Balboa?

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:34.762
And as much excitement
as there is in the arena...

01:21:34.932 --> 01:21:37.298
...there's a sense of foreboding
as well.

01:21:41.639 --> 01:21:45.302
And now, Mason "The Line" Dixon
goes to work with his jab as though...

01:21:45.476 --> 01:21:49.344
...he's fighting against the number one
challenger in the heavyweight division.

01:21:49.781 --> 01:21:51.681
See, this is to be expected early on.

01:21:51.849 --> 01:21:54.545
You knew the champ would
control the distance with his jab...

01:21:54.719 --> 01:21:56.744
...his height, his range.

01:21:58.122 --> 01:22:01.216
Balboa looking to get in a shot,
misses wildly.

01:22:01.392 --> 01:22:03.223
Did you like that?

01:22:03.694 --> 01:22:06.822
It looks like a speed bag
against a punching bag.

01:22:07.031 --> 01:22:08.623
Rocky's understandably frustrated...

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.132
...but he came out of retirement
to get into a fight.

01:22:11.302 --> 01:22:13.862
Guys named Rocky
don't like to be toyed with.

01:22:14.038 --> 01:22:15.733
One punch could still turn it around.

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:19.034
Apparently he forgot
his arthritis meds this morning.

01:22:19.343 --> 01:22:20.810
Rocky misses.

01:22:21.179 --> 01:22:24.910
There's a meat-seeking missile
on the point of the chin by the champ.

01:22:25.082 --> 01:22:27.812
- More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.
- <i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

01:22:27.985 --> 01:22:31.318
And there's a hard right hand
and a left and a right by Balboa!

01:22:31.489 --> 01:22:34.458
He drives Dixon into the ropes
with a series of shots!

01:22:34.625 --> 01:22:37.059
And the crowd goes berserk!

01:22:41.899 --> 01:22:46.165
Dixon punishing Balboa for
the temerity of landing those shots.

01:22:49.674 --> 01:22:54.270
It's toe to toe in the corner.
Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:03.885
Balboa landing potent combinations
to the head of the champion.

01:23:04.222 --> 01:23:05.450
A wake-up call for Dixon.

01:23:05.623 --> 01:23:07.250
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:23:07.425 --> 01:23:10.622
- The man's got bricks in his gloves.
- Where's the stuff in the basement?

01:23:10.795 --> 01:23:12.990
- It's still there.
- He came to battle, okay?

01:23:13.164 --> 01:23:14.631
- Trying to knock me out.
- Listen.

01:23:14.799 --> 01:23:17.233
If there's a bone he can break,
he's gonna do it.

01:23:17.401 --> 01:23:19.699
- Give the man respect.
- What about my respect?

01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:22.704
CompuBox numbers
tell the grisly story here.

01:23:22.874 --> 01:23:25.934
Balboa landed nine of 13
punches in that round.

01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:31.275
Dixon landed an incredible
59 out of 69.

01:23:31.449 --> 01:23:34.907
- Why don't you listen to me?
- Rocky's been here a million times.

01:23:35.086 --> 01:23:38.283
Coming out to start a round after
he took a beating in the previous one.

01:23:38.456 --> 01:23:41.619
- Remember what I said, okay?
- I warned him. I warned him.

01:23:42.693 --> 01:23:47.630
He's tired. His legs are going fast,
or already gone.

01:23:47.798 --> 01:23:52.360
And what's truly extraordinary
is that Rocky can still take it.

01:23:52.537 --> 01:23:57.474
The boxing commission, which
was criticized for licensing him...

01:23:57.642 --> 01:24:01.874
...would be massacred
if something happened to Rocky.

01:24:05.182 --> 01:24:07.844
And a monstrous straight left hand!
Down goes Rocky!

01:24:08.052 --> 01:24:10.350
And that could conceivably
be the end of the fight!

01:24:10.521 --> 01:24:14.355
That could be the exhibition
right there. But no. Balboa up.

01:24:14.525 --> 01:24:18.825
Referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants
to continue, and Rocky says yes.

01:24:18.996 --> 01:24:21.863
Even Rocky Balboa could be
too brave for his own good.

01:24:22.033 --> 01:24:25.628
Dixon comes right back to try to
finish it. Balboa almost went down!

01:24:25.803 --> 01:24:27.794
Rocky actually shoves Dixon back.

01:24:27.972 --> 01:24:30.497
As Dixon lands these brutal shots.

01:24:30.675 --> 01:24:33.235
- Cover up! Cover up!
- Open shots at close range.

01:24:33.411 --> 01:24:35.936
Right and left hands,
and down goes Balboa!

01:24:36.113 --> 01:24:39.480
Perhaps for the last time
in his fighting career!

01:24:39.650 --> 01:24:42.050
- That should do it.
- Three! Four!

01:24:42.219 --> 01:24:44.551
Five! Six!

01:24:44.722 --> 01:24:46.349
Get up! Get up!
- Seven!

01:24:46.524 --> 01:24:48.321
Eight! Nine!

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.957
- How do you feel, man? You okay?
- Now Rocky is furious with himself.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:55.724
He convinces Cortez
he wants to keep fighting.

01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.765
Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it.

01:24:57.935 --> 01:25:00.028
Rocky waving his arms
and saying he's fine.

01:25:00.204 --> 01:25:02.365
- He wants to go on!
- Let it go! Let it go!

01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:06.367
And Balboa comes back!
With a left and a right...

01:25:06.544 --> 01:25:10.446
...and bulls Dixon into the ropes
for the second round in a row!

01:25:11.649 --> 01:25:14.209
Back comes Dixon
with brutal left-hand shots.

01:25:14.385 --> 01:25:16.580
- Dixon hurt his hand there!
- Go after him!

01:25:16.754 --> 01:25:18.415
This is Rocky's best chance!

01:25:18.589 --> 01:25:20.819
The champ obviously hurt
his hand on Rocky's hip!

01:25:20.992 --> 01:25:24.826
And Balboa immediately going to
work to the body! Huge right hook!

01:25:24.996 --> 01:25:28.557
Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body!
These are big punches.

01:25:28.799 --> 01:25:32.530
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

01:25:33.938 --> 01:25:34.996
Yes!

01:25:37.441 --> 01:25:41.901
Rocky Balboa has knocked the
reigning heavyweight champion down!

01:25:42.079 --> 01:25:43.979
- You hurt him!
- Mason "The Line" Dixon...

01:25:44.148 --> 01:25:46.207
...has never taken
this kind of punishment...

01:25:46.384 --> 01:25:48.545
...in his entire professional career!

01:25:48.719 --> 01:25:52.712
Maybe he's clearing his head, but
the body shots really caved in his ribs.

01:25:52.890 --> 01:25:55.552
Balboa is thinking knockout himself!

01:25:55.726 --> 01:25:59.253
Another counterhook by Balboa,
followed by two more!

01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:01.921
Dixon fires back his own hooks!
Now Rocky's stunned.

01:26:02.099 --> 01:26:04.624
It's an all-out war along the ropes...

01:26:04.802 --> 01:26:09.830
...as round two comes to a close
amid a giant tumult in the ring!

01:26:10.541 --> 01:26:12.133
Incredible.

01:26:12.309 --> 01:26:13.970
All right!

01:26:14.145 --> 01:26:15.942
Welcome to Rockyland.

01:26:20.051 --> 01:26:22.485
- How's the hand?
- My hand's broken.

01:26:24.588 --> 01:26:26.613
We lose, it's your ass! Your ass!

01:26:26.791 --> 01:26:29.089
It will numb up on you
in a few rounds.

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:32.855
Once that hand numbs up,
Dixon will be able to throw it hard.

01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:35.430
Until then, here is Rocky's chance.

01:26:35.599 --> 01:26:38.329
- No reverse!
- Take the pain, champ.

01:26:38.502 --> 01:26:41.300
Stay on him! Everybody thought
this was a joke, including me!

01:26:41.472 --> 01:26:44.100
Now nobody's laughing!
Stay on him! You go get him!

01:26:44.875 --> 01:26:46.775
Go out strong!

01:26:58.589 --> 01:26:59.578
Keep him off you!

01:27:03.461 --> 01:27:04.450
That's it! That's it!

01:27:18.909 --> 01:27:20.968
You won that round.
Break him down.

01:27:26.650 --> 01:27:28.641
Bomb him! Bomb him!

01:27:34.358 --> 01:27:35.552
Yeah!

01:27:39.497 --> 01:27:41.795
Just keep throwing them bombs!

01:27:53.577 --> 01:27:54.737
Come on.

01:28:02.286 --> 01:28:04.345
You can do this.

01:28:05.222 --> 01:28:07.986
Rocko. Rocko.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.966
Yeah, come on, go!

01:29:16.026 --> 01:29:17.891
Go through him! Run over him!

01:29:33.344 --> 01:29:34.572
Unload on him!

01:29:36.447 --> 01:29:37.436
Get down, Mason!

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.251
They're leaving nothing
on the table, guys.

01:29:51.462 --> 01:29:55.956
The fans are still standing. They may
not be able to sit down for a week.

01:29:56.133 --> 01:29:58.897
- You're doing great!
- I'm doing better than I thought.

01:29:59.069 --> 01:30:02.869
- You sure he's okay?
- I've had worse.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.771
Toe to toe, one round to go. Who
would've believed this was possible?

01:30:06.944 --> 01:30:09.310
- Can you see out of that eye?
- Let me talk to him.

01:30:09.713 --> 01:30:11.738
Don't take any more chances
than you have to.

01:30:11.916 --> 01:30:14.885
There's nothing more to prove, Pop.
There's nothing more to prove.

01:30:15.052 --> 01:30:17.179
I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.

01:30:17.354 --> 01:30:18.912
You can do it, Rocko!

01:30:19.123 --> 01:30:21.421
- One more round, we go home.
- Okay, then do it.

01:30:21.592 --> 01:30:25.119
There's an old saying that
every great champion has...

01:30:25.296 --> 01:30:30.598
...one great fight left in him,
and Rocky is proving it so far.

01:30:30.768 --> 01:30:33.965
- Come on. Touch them up.
- Rocko! The last round of your life!

01:30:34.138 --> 01:30:35.799
- Come on, guys.
- The last round!

01:30:35.973 --> 01:30:38.339
Come on. Touch them up, let's go.
Touch them up.

01:30:39.009 --> 01:30:41.910
- You are one crazy old man.
- You'll get there.

01:30:42.379 --> 01:30:43.539
Let's go.

01:30:43.847 --> 01:30:47.078
Tenth round of a scheduled 10.
Who would ever have dreamed...

01:30:47.251 --> 01:30:52.052
...that Rocky Balboa would still be
in this quote, "exhibition," against...

01:30:52.222 --> 01:30:54.986
...the heavyweight champion?
- You can do it! Come on!

01:30:55.159 --> 01:30:59.493
This fight is as though Dixon
got on-the-job training in courage.

01:31:00.597 --> 01:31:03.361
- Cover up! Cover up!
- They're both in a pain-free zone!

01:31:03.534 --> 01:31:06.765
These guys are fighting
in another dimension right now!

01:31:06.937 --> 01:31:10.998
Beyond belief! Balboa just walking
straight into Dixon's punches.

01:31:11.175 --> 01:31:13.769
Target practice for Dixon.

01:31:17.214 --> 01:31:19.682
They're exchanging right hooks!
Balboa's drilled!

01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:23.081
Here comes Dixon! He's exhausted
from just punching the man!

01:31:24.955 --> 01:31:26.286
Knock this bum out, Mase!

01:31:38.836 --> 01:31:42.863
<i>What is it you said to the kid?</i>
<i>It ain't about how hard you hit.</i>

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.067
<i>It's about how hard you can get hit</i>
<i>and keep moving forward.</i>

01:31:47.378 --> 01:31:51.075
<i>How much you can take</i>
<i>and keep moving forward.</i>

01:31:51.248 --> 01:31:53.045
- <i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>
- <i>Get up.</i>

01:31:53.217 --> 01:31:55.208
- Let's go! Get up!
- <i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

01:31:55.419 --> 01:31:58.115
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

01:31:58.355 --> 01:32:00.255
<i>Get up.</i>

01:32:21.311 --> 01:32:24.906
Another monster body shot. Rocky's
ancestors must have felt that one.

01:32:25.082 --> 01:32:27.141
Come on, Rocky!
Start moving those hands!

01:32:27.384 --> 01:32:29.079
Less than two minutes to go.

01:32:29.253 --> 01:32:31.619
The crowd is astonished
that Balboa got up.

01:32:31.789 --> 01:32:34.280
- Come on!
- Turn it over! All the way through!

01:32:34.725 --> 01:32:36.420
And retaliates with fury!

01:32:39.963 --> 01:32:41.157
Chop him down!

01:32:44.835 --> 01:32:46.496
Come on, Rocky! Come on!

01:32:48.939 --> 01:32:50.497
Take him out now!

01:32:51.642 --> 01:32:53.701
They're trading shots again!

01:32:53.877 --> 01:32:57.472
Balboa is trying to hit
anything and anywhere!

01:32:59.817 --> 01:33:01.148
Win it! Win it!

01:33:10.294 --> 01:33:10.894
Yes!

01:33:10.894 --> 01:33:11.792
Yes!

01:33:20.571 --> 01:33:23.404
You're a great champion.
You got heart.

01:33:23.574 --> 01:33:25.337
Thanks for the opportunity.
Good man.

01:33:28.378 --> 01:33:31.472
That was unbelievable. That was
the greatest thing I've ever seen.

01:33:33.617 --> 01:33:36.347
You did it. That's the kind
of fighting you're talking about.

01:33:37.921 --> 01:33:39.889
Hey, Paulie.

01:33:40.090 --> 01:33:42.923
That beast is gone now.
The beast is out.

01:33:43.093 --> 01:33:46.893
One of the most overused words
in sports, guys, is "incredible."

01:33:47.064 --> 01:33:51.364
I hate to say it. This is incredible.

01:33:52.736 --> 01:33:54.397
Let's go!

01:33:57.141 --> 01:34:00.804
Ladies and gentlemen,
before we go to the scorecards...

01:34:00.978 --> 01:34:07.076
...a round of applause for these
two heavyweight warriors!

01:34:11.722 --> 01:34:15.715
We have a split decision.

01:34:18.362 --> 01:34:23.231
Adelaide Byrd scores it 95-94...

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.197
...Dixon.

01:34:26.503 --> 01:34:30.906
Chuck Giampa has it 95-94...

01:34:31.074 --> 01:34:33.042
...Balboa.

01:34:40.217 --> 01:34:45.086
And Bill Graham scores it 95-94...

01:34:45.255 --> 01:34:50.420
...for the winner by split decision,
and still undefeated...

01:34:50.594 --> 01:34:53.461
...the heavyweight champion
of the world...

01:34:53.630 --> 01:34:59.330
...Mason "The Line" Dixon!

01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:04.730
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

01:35:56.393 --> 01:35:59.362
You know, I couldn't have
done nothing without you.

01:36:01.832 --> 01:36:04.392
Yo, Adrian, we did it.

01:36:11.174 --> 01:36:12.937
We did it.
