WEBVTT

00:06.601 --> 00:07.689
The Dark Ones.

00:07.819 --> 00:08.864
They're here.

00:08.994 --> 00:10.344
Ruby killed me.

00:10.474 --> 00:12.041
She killed me with the dagger.

00:12.171 --> 00:13.912
There's someone else inside of her body.

00:14.043 --> 00:15.653
That's why Kelly couldn't come
through the rift.

00:15.784 --> 00:17.307
Her soul doesn't have a body
to come back to.

00:17.438 --> 00:19.831
It's a little weird having
Kelly doing this to me.

00:19.962 --> 00:23.095
Pablo, I'm going to the hardware
store so get the rift ready.

00:23.226 --> 00:25.903
I got Kelly, I got the Necronomicon.

00:25.973 --> 00:28.144
Ruby's dead.

00:28.274 --> 00:30.364
<i>We interrupt this
program with an emergency bulletin.</i>

00:30.494 --> 00:32.192
<i>Due to the extensive violent rioting,</i>

00:32.293 --> 00:35.456
<i>the Governor of Michigan
has implemented Marshall Law.</i>

00:35.586 --> 00:38.720
The Dark Ones,
they got the Necronomicon.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.680
Run!

00:42.811 --> 00:45.814
Run, run, run! Go, go!

00:45.944 --> 00:47.773
Run!

00:47.882 --> 00:49.339
Fuuuuuck!!

00:50.384 --> 00:52.081
Dad?

00:52.211 --> 00:53.865
Brandy.

00:53.996 --> 00:55.127
As your father,

00:55.258 --> 00:57.826
I will always tell you to stand up
for what you believe in.

00:57.956 --> 01:00.089
But in this case...

01:00.219 --> 01:01.307
Run!

01:04.397 --> 01:06.182
Pablo, help me get Kelly's body!

01:07.575 --> 01:10.969
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Get that dagger!

01:16.033 --> 01:17.149
I got it!

01:18.716 --> 01:21.240
One by one, we will take you!

01:21.371 --> 01:22.764
Brandy, duck!

01:24.461 --> 01:26.075
This way! Out the back door!

01:26.145 --> 01:27.464
Give me that dagger!

01:29.292 --> 01:30.380
Come on.

01:34.515 --> 01:36.255
Dead by Dawn!

01:36.386 --> 01:37.561
Dead by Dawn!

01:44.307 --> 01:46.178
I have never been so proud.

01:48.485 --> 01:51.357
Come on! Now!

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074

02:01.078 --> 02:04.414
Oh, yeah. Right!

02:04.545 --> 02:05.807
What is that?

02:05.937 --> 02:07.678
It's Kandar, the Destroyer.

02:07.809 --> 02:10.072
And it's come to test the mettle of man.

02:10.202 --> 02:12.204
Ash?

02:12.335 --> 02:14.119
We're doomed.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.686
This is it, Ash.

02:15.817 --> 02:17.209
Everything that's ever been foretold:

02:17.340 --> 02:19.037
The Necronomicon, your destiny.

02:19.168 --> 02:21.387
It all comes down to this moment.

02:21.518 --> 02:23.564
It's the final test, <i>Jefe</i>.

02:23.589 --> 02:24.608
He's right!

02:24.739 --> 02:26.044
Ash is the demon killer.

02:26.175 --> 02:27.568
So go!

02:27.698 --> 02:29.178
Go kill the demon!

02:29.203 --> 02:31.918
Yes, I do kill demons. But that...

02:32.059 --> 02:34.410
that thing is... bullshit, man.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.237
No way. I'm not doing it.

02:36.368 --> 02:37.488
If it's here to test you, then...

02:37.597 --> 02:38.594
then you will get out there

02:38.718 --> 02:40.110
- and you will fight!
- Let go of him!

02:40.241 --> 02:41.329
Get your hands off me! Go out there!

02:41.460 --> 02:42.678
No! Let go of him!

02:42.809 --> 02:44.767
Damn you, Ash Williams!

02:44.898 --> 02:46.595
You're no hero. You're a coward!

02:46.726 --> 02:48.075
And you're going to get us all killed!

02:48.205 --> 02:49.642
Well, I'm not gonna let that happen.

02:49.772 --> 02:51.383
Hey, he's here!

02:51.513 --> 02:53.472
Hey, Ash Williams, is the one you want!

02:53.602 --> 02:56.953
- Dude, that's a really bad idea!
- He's right here.

03:05.266 --> 03:06.441
Let's go!

03:08.865 --> 03:10.706
I'm right behind you!

03:29.856 --> 03:30.813
This can't be real!

03:30.944 --> 03:31.988
This can't be happening!

03:32.119 --> 03:33.860
Oh, it's real.

03:37.603 --> 03:38.691
Okay.

03:39.779 --> 03:42.999
This is a bit worse than usual.

03:43.130 --> 03:44.305
A bit worse?

03:44.436 --> 03:45.828
Dad, what are we going to do?

03:45.959 --> 03:47.090
How are we gonna fight that thing?

03:47.221 --> 03:48.614
Maybe it'll just go away.

03:48.744 --> 03:50.877
Guys, check this out.

03:52.705 --> 03:54.228
<i>Auckland, Paris and Berlin</i>

03:54.358 --> 03:56.448
<i>are now reporting similar
events to New York.</i>

03:56.578 --> 03:59.189
<i>Militaries in affected
countries are being mobilized.</i>

03:59.320 --> 04:01.936
<i>Let's go over to Gordon Daly
in New York.</i>

04:02.030 --> 04:03.081
<i>What happened?</i>

04:03.106 --> 04:05.608
<i>- What did you see?
- Ah, ah, the...</i>

04:05.678 --> 04:08.242

04:08.316 --> 04:11.637

Oh, my God.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.838
<i>Jefe</i>...

04:18.993 --> 04:21.082
It's global.

04:21.298 --> 04:22.909
Global?

04:24.301 --> 04:25.477
Oh, great.

04:25.607 --> 04:27.722
I've doomed humanity.

04:32.042 --> 04:35.095
Yeah, well, you know what?

04:36.010 --> 04:37.620
Not like I didn't tell 'em.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.041
Pablo, how many times
you heard me say this, huh?

04:40.100 --> 04:41.928
Why me?!

04:42.058 --> 04:44.060
Who am I?! Nobody.

04:44.191 --> 04:47.368
Nobody! Guy from Elk Grove, Michigan.

04:47.499 --> 04:48.630
Where the fuck is that?

04:48.761 --> 04:50.937
In the middle of Jack shit nowhere.
That's where.

04:51.067 --> 04:53.287
You know what? I got news for you.

04:53.417 --> 04:54.854
I didn't ask for this!

04:54.984 --> 04:56.595
You think I want this horse shit?

04:56.725 --> 04:58.422
Be covered in blood twenty four-seven?

04:58.553 --> 05:00.642
Who the fuck would want that?!

05:02.557 --> 05:05.429
Savior my ass.

05:08.171 --> 05:11.261
I'm a... a god damn failure.

05:11.392 --> 05:12.698
Don't say that.

05:12.828 --> 05:15.222
<i>- Jefe</i>, we're still in this.
- Yeah.

05:15.352 --> 05:16.615
We got Kelly's body.

05:16.745 --> 05:18.836
- We need to save her.
- Yeah, why?

05:18.914 --> 05:20.617
So she can die with the rest of us?

05:20.703 --> 05:22.664
So she can die with the rest
of the human race?!

05:24.536 --> 05:26.146
Enough!

05:26.276 --> 05:28.540
I don't know much
about this Evil Dead crap,

05:28.670 --> 05:30.454
and I know even less
about why it chose you.

05:30.585 --> 05:32.326
But it did.

05:32.456 --> 05:33.980
You're the "Savior of Humanity"

05:34.110 --> 05:37.679
so get on your damn feet
and own up to who you are!

05:37.810 --> 05:39.246
In the short time that I have known you,

05:39.376 --> 05:42.771
I have seen things
that I never thought existed.

05:42.902 --> 05:46.558
Seen you do things that
I never thought possible.

05:46.688 --> 05:50.213
You taught me to trust you,
you taught to believe in you.

05:50.344 --> 05:51.563
And I do.

05:51.693 --> 05:53.565
Please, don't let me down now.

05:57.264 --> 05:58.526
You're right by God.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.013
Oh, boy.

06:07.143 --> 06:08.797
Give-give me a hand here.

06:11.090 --> 06:14.586
I've been kicking Evil's ass
for more than thirty years.

06:14.716 --> 06:19.025
Who cares if Kandar is six feet
tall or six hundred?

06:19.155 --> 06:22.071
I'm gonna show the world
what a Williams can do.

06:25.597 --> 06:26.641
First things first.

06:29.339 --> 06:31.211
Is this really the best time
to be getting baked?

06:31.341 --> 06:33.561
I'm not gonna fight
that thing with a clear head.

06:35.345 --> 06:36.477
No.

06:39.096 --> 06:40.807
- Don't do drugs.
- But you...

06:40.869 --> 06:43.005
Are not going to pick up
the bad habits of your father.

06:43.127 --> 06:45.433
You got that?

06:45.462 --> 06:48.184
- Yes, Dad.
- Okay, gear up.

06:48.315 --> 06:50.099
Get some water, some food, some tools.

06:50.230 --> 06:52.449
- Where are we going?
- You are going out of town.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.712
No, I'm not leaving now.

06:53.842 --> 06:55.452
You can't stay here.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.151
Evil has a bullseye on my back
the size of Tiger Stadium.

06:58.281 --> 06:59.500
I can't put you in any more danger.

06:59.590 --> 07:00.894
No, I can take care of myself!

07:00.965 --> 07:02.043
- No!
- Why not?!

07:02.111 --> 07:04.097
Because I can't watch you die again!

07:09.058 --> 07:12.774
Look, I know that we don't
really know each other...

07:12.905 --> 07:14.428
but you're my daughter.

07:14.558 --> 07:16.038
You're part of me.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.127
Yeah, and you're all
that I have left now.

07:19.433 --> 07:22.175
- If we are going to die...
- Again.

07:22.305 --> 07:24.732
Again. I want to die together.

07:25.739 --> 07:26.850
I'm a Williams too.

07:26.919 --> 07:28.572
We're family.

07:32.643 --> 07:33.655
Okay.

07:35.231 --> 07:37.407
Hey, Pablo, lets get back to that
rift and save Kelly's soul,

07:37.538 --> 07:40.729
because honestly, I can't stand
her smell much longer.

07:40.799 --> 07:42.021
But how?

07:42.151 --> 07:43.401
Evil's all over Elk Grove.

07:43.472 --> 07:45.104
There's no way you
and Brandy are gonna make it

07:45.175 --> 07:47.243
- to the hardware store.
- What? And you can?

07:47.374 --> 07:49.942
There's something
about my <i>Brujo</i> abilities.

07:50.072 --> 07:52.074
Evil sees me as one of them.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.250
So, you're like Kane.

07:54.381 --> 07:55.675
That's what I was thinking.

07:55.700 --> 07:56.706
Kane?

07:56.731 --> 07:58.273
Kane. WWE. He's a wrestler.

07:58.298 --> 07:59.516
Half good, half bad.

07:59.550 --> 08:00.785
Come on, Brandy keep up.

08:00.816 --> 08:03.216
Pablo, you can't do this alone.

08:03.346 --> 08:06.251
I know a way me and Brandy can
get there without being seen.

08:12.355 --> 08:15.141
Okay, this connects
to the main line in town.

08:15.271 --> 08:17.404
Which leads right
to the hardware store cellar.

08:17.534 --> 08:18.840
Unseen!

08:18.971 --> 08:20.494
Always thinking one step ahead of Evil.

08:25.753 --> 08:27.893
Those are military jets, <i>Jefe</i>!

08:28.023 --> 08:30.667
Okay, this won't take us long.
We'll meet you there.

08:30.792 --> 08:33.855
- Ready?
- Fine. Let's dance.

08:44.431 --> 08:46.215
Whoa.

08:46.346 --> 08:48.391
What is this place?

08:48.522 --> 08:49.741
Well, most of Elk Grove

08:49.871 --> 08:51.655
drains right through
this abandoned mine.

08:51.786 --> 08:52.787
It's this way.

09:25.099 --> 09:26.125
Holy shit!

09:26.255 --> 09:28.475
They're just making it more powerful.

09:43.065 --> 09:44.221
Three days ago my biggest concern

09:44.281 --> 09:45.935
was getting out of Elk Grove.

09:46.058 --> 09:49.235
Now I'm under it, with Ashy Slashy,

09:49.365 --> 09:51.019
who turns out to be my father

09:51.150 --> 09:53.271
and we're facing the end of humanity.

09:53.349 --> 09:55.415
Yep. That's a hell
of a shit sandwich, kiddo.

09:55.545 --> 09:57.025
I eat 'em everyday.

09:57.156 --> 09:58.494
I'm really sorry.

10:00.724 --> 10:03.466
That must've really sucked going
through everything you did

10:03.597 --> 10:05.817
and no one believing you.

10:05.947 --> 10:07.209
When this is all over,

10:07.340 --> 10:09.385
I'd really like to hear about it.

10:09.516 --> 10:11.735
And you.

10:11.866 --> 10:14.782
Deal.

10:14.913 --> 10:17.480
Hey, uh...

10:22.703 --> 10:25.097
The night I first found the
Necronomicon, I had this.

10:27.447 --> 10:30.624
I've never told anyone this before,

10:30.754 --> 10:33.018
but ever since that day,

10:33.148 --> 10:35.411
I always carried this necklace on me.

10:35.542 --> 10:36.760
Not sure why exactly.

10:36.891 --> 10:38.414
I guess I thought it would keep me safe.

10:41.678 --> 10:43.064
I want you to have it.

10:43.173 --> 10:44.767
- Oh, I can't take that.
- No, please.

10:44.868 --> 10:45.876
Trust me.

10:45.939 --> 10:48.207
I can't keep doing this shit forever.

10:48.290 --> 10:50.078
It belongs in your hands now.

10:50.142 --> 10:52.037
I feel better knowing that you have it.

10:56.335 --> 10:58.067
Thank you.

11:09.442 --> 11:11.932
I don't think we're alone down here.

11:14.971 --> 11:20.804
- Ashy Slashy hatching and saw.
- Don't worry. It's only one of 'em.

11:22.806 --> 11:26.854
And all of his buddies.

11:26.985 --> 11:31.337
Ashy Slashy...

11:31.467 --> 11:34.906
cuts off your tongue so you can...

11:42.858 --> 11:44.306
Go! That way!

11:46.608 --> 11:48.397
Where are you going?

11:58.407 --> 11:59.452
Get out of here, daughter.

12:17.252 --> 12:19.994
We're not finished with you!

12:35.488 --> 12:37.033
<i>Jefe</i>!

12:37.098 --> 12:38.882
Evil's upstairs.

12:38.946 --> 12:40.009
They're in the drains too.

12:40.058 --> 12:41.259
Okay, no time to waste.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.228
- Do me.
- No, I'm going in.

12:43.314 --> 12:45.157
What did I just tell you
about the "not dying" thing?

12:45.193 --> 12:47.065
- Oh, my God!
- You wanna be grounded?

12:47.195 --> 12:49.156
- My God.
- One foot in each world.

12:50.633 --> 12:53.158
<i>Jefe</i>, the rift's already open.

12:53.288 --> 12:55.638
- I might be able to just go in.
- No, Pablo.

12:55.769 --> 12:57.640
- What if you're wrong?
- What if I'm right?

12:59.338 --> 13:00.469
Brandy.

13:05.344 --> 13:06.954
Dad...

13:07.085 --> 13:09.304
I can do this, <i>Jefe</i>.

13:09.435 --> 13:10.958
All right, go get her.

13:15.441 --> 13:17.095
Brandy, hang onto that!

13:17.225 --> 13:18.357
I got these jokers.

13:19.836 --> 13:21.012
And I got this guy.

13:27.409 --> 13:28.541
Here we go.

13:30.891 --> 13:32.110
We found you Ash!

13:32.240 --> 13:34.808
The Book of the Dead is now ours...

13:34.938 --> 13:35.939
Your Mama should have taught

13:35.974 --> 13:37.090
you not to speak with your mouth full.

14:13.304 --> 14:15.655
Heads up.

14:19.766 --> 14:21.159
What the fuck!

14:33.519 --> 14:35.956
Pablo!

14:40.896 --> 14:43.066
Kelly?

14:43.889 --> 14:44.934
No.

14:45.096 --> 14:46.967
No, no, no. Kelly.

14:47.098 --> 14:49.317
Kelly?

14:49.448 --> 14:50.797
I brought her through.

14:50.882 --> 14:51.913
No!

14:51.972 --> 14:53.321
No!

14:53.443 --> 14:55.845
No! I don't understand.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.051
I wanted to save you, but I couldn't.

15:02.472 --> 15:04.778
I'm sorry.

15:04.932 --> 15:07.418
<i>Descansa en paz, mi amor.</i>

15:11.034 --> 15:14.255
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:14.386 --> 15:15.865
You're fine.

15:15.996 --> 15:17.128
You're safe.

15:19.347 --> 15:20.653
Am I alive?

15:20.783 --> 15:22.785
- Mm-hm.
- You're alive.

15:31.161 --> 15:33.627
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:36.016 --> 15:38.888
What the actual...

15:39.019 --> 15:41.500
Fuck me!

15:41.630 --> 15:43.632
Oh, I look like Keith Richards.

15:43.763 --> 15:45.112
I was thinking more Iggy Pop.

15:45.243 --> 15:46.896
Filthy and not fine.

15:48.898 --> 15:51.118
Yep, there's two of 'em now.

15:52.574 --> 15:54.774
- Hey, Ash.
- Easy.

15:56.993 --> 15:59.735
I'm sorry, Ash.

15:59.866 --> 16:02.340
I thought I could take Ruby on my own.

16:03.851 --> 16:06.201
I thought I could be like you.

16:06.426 --> 16:07.775
I was wrong.

16:07.927 --> 16:09.092
Fuckin' A right, you were.

16:10.659 --> 16:12.487
Oh, Ash, what the hell
did you do this time?

16:12.618 --> 16:14.315
Nothing! Didn't do anything.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.405
The Dark Ones have the Necronomicon.

16:17.536 --> 16:18.493
What?

16:18.624 --> 16:19.755
Get out!

16:19.886 --> 16:21.192
Get out now!

16:56.923 --> 16:58.316
Dad, don't leave me.

16:58.446 --> 16:59.969
I won't, kiddo.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.785
I promise you.

17:14.664 --> 17:17.422
Mom?! Mom!

17:17.551 --> 17:19.554
Where are you, Mom?

17:21.295 --> 17:23.602
Hi, hey, you okay? You hurt?

17:23.732 --> 17:24.777
No?

17:24.906 --> 17:25.994
Fall back! Bravo, cover fire!

17:26.126 --> 17:27.214
Move, move, move!

17:27.345 --> 17:29.608
Come on! Move it, move it!

17:29.738 --> 17:30.783
Jesus!

17:30.913 --> 17:32.231
Hold your fire!

17:32.309 --> 17:35.091
- Everybody okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.859
- Let's go!
- I repeat, fall back...

17:37.887 --> 17:39.052
Federal law!

17:39.182 --> 17:40.401
There we go.

17:40.532 --> 17:42.424
All right, hang on tight!

17:42.508 --> 17:44.249
Fall back!

17:44.321 --> 17:46.022
Move back! Move back!

17:48.670 --> 17:50.281
Back, back, back!

17:50.411 --> 17:51.934
Oh, shit!

17:53.849 --> 17:55.851
Behind you! Watch out!

18:04.947 --> 18:06.601
Come on!

18:06.732 --> 18:08.560
Fuck you!

18:14.130 --> 18:15.784
Kelly!

18:15.915 --> 18:17.656
Come on!

18:17.786 --> 18:20.322
I got ya!

18:21.283 --> 18:22.624
- Come with me!
- Get 'em in there!

18:22.682 --> 18:23.879
Let's go! Let's go!

18:25.455 --> 18:27.230
Get into the transport!
We're evacuating!

18:27.361 --> 18:28.884
We're out of time, people!

18:29.015 --> 18:30.843
Sir!

18:30.973 --> 18:33.233
Strike group authorized!
They're gonna nuke it!

18:33.326 --> 18:35.413
God damnit! Not until we're clear!
On our signal!

18:35.441 --> 18:37.138
On our signal!

18:37.264 --> 18:39.014
<i>Jefe</i>! That won't kill it.

18:39.108 --> 18:40.358
It's only gonna make it stronger.

18:40.383 --> 18:41.688
- Bigger.
- Hey, chief!

18:41.854 --> 18:43.116
I wouldn't nuke
that thing if I were you.

18:43.246 --> 18:44.509
Get your ass into the transport

18:44.639 --> 18:46.467
or you're on your own, cowboy!

18:50.079 --> 18:52.168
Fuck!

18:53.953 --> 18:55.258
- Give me that!
- Fuck!

18:55.389 --> 18:57.043
- Yeah, you want some more?
- Come on, let's go!

18:57.173 --> 18:58.566
Let's go! Get in there!

18:58.697 --> 18:59.915
Gather up the rest of this!

19:00.046 --> 19:01.439
We're out! We then fire!

19:01.569 --> 19:03.919
Dad, get in!

19:25.332 --> 19:26.986
No!

19:27.116 --> 19:28.814
What are you doing!?

19:28.944 --> 19:33.558
My father always said I ran
from my fights, Brandy.

19:33.688 --> 19:34.950
I'm not running from this one.

19:35.081 --> 19:37.779
Ash, come on. Get in the fucking truck!

19:39.625 --> 19:42.697
Kelly, the people are
gonna need a strong leader.

19:42.828 --> 19:44.395
Someone they can depend on.

19:44.525 --> 19:45.831
Someone they can believe in.

19:46.614 --> 19:48.268
That's you.

19:48.399 --> 19:49.704
Pablo.

19:49.835 --> 19:51.880
You're the <i>Jefe</i> now.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.406
You save them.

19:59.758 --> 20:01.760
You said you wouldn't leave me!

20:01.890 --> 20:03.196
I'm doing this for you.

20:03.326 --> 20:05.938
I'm doing it for all of you.

20:06.068 --> 20:08.984
I gotta finally for once,
own up to who the hell I am.

20:17.297 --> 20:18.763
Soldiers, we are leaving!

20:18.788 --> 20:19.778
Let's go!

20:27.663 --> 20:30.005
I repeat. Clear.

20:45.238 --> 20:46.587
Come get some.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.075
Oh, that could be handy.

21:03.662 --> 21:07.397
Okay Ash, just like Battle Zone,
the arcade game.

21:07.506 --> 21:08.653
How hard could it be right?

21:23.232 --> 21:24.843
Sorry, Pablo! My bad!

21:33.460 --> 21:34.592
That's it.

21:47.169 --> 21:48.649
Come on, you bucket of bolts!

21:54.786 --> 21:56.352
Okay, big boy!

21:56.483 --> 21:59.269
Ashley J. Williams is coming for you!

21:59.530 --> 22:01.619
Yeeeaaah!

22:18.947 --> 22:21.464
There you are, you big bastard!

22:21.595 --> 22:22.944
Don't go anywhere.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.946
I've got a little something for ya.

22:42.939 --> 22:45.616
Locked and loaded.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.363
Hey, you bag of assholes!

22:50.493 --> 22:52.626
You looking for me!?

23:11.027 --> 23:12.792
You want to test the mettle of man, huh?

23:15.040 --> 23:17.172
How about if you taste
the metal of man?!

23:20.358 --> 23:21.873
Oh, crap!

23:22.003 --> 23:23.135
Whoa!

23:30.035 --> 23:31.404
Whoa!

23:33.493 --> 23:35.843
Whoooooa!

24:19.337 --> 24:22.212
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

24:22.509 --> 24:25.110
Ohh! Noooo!

25:50.352 --> 25:51.762
Hello.

26:34.848 --> 26:36.154
The Savior is awake.

26:39.635 --> 26:40.811
Come.

27:17.184 --> 27:18.413
Oh, no.

27:18.544 --> 27:20.496
It's all gone.

27:20.598 --> 27:22.156
Not everything.

27:33.554 --> 27:35.380
Okay.

27:35.466 --> 27:36.691
What's going on?

27:36.778 --> 27:37.998
Where's my daughter?

27:40.653 --> 27:42.278
I'll explain while you drive.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.129
The Dark Ones are on the move.

28:21.172 --> 28:23.043
How do you feel, Sire?

28:27.308 --> 28:28.875
Groovy.

28:28.900 --> 28:29.982
Heeaaahh!
