WEBVTT

00:14.000 --> 00:15.733
(SOLDIERS MARCHING)

00:40.529 --> 00:43.763
MINOS: I love you
more than anything.
ARIADNE: I know.

00:44.329 --> 00:46.963
-Gods be with you.
-And you.

01:10.210 --> 01:11.277
(GASPS)

01:12.410 --> 01:14.344
(WHISPERING) Don't be afraid.

01:14.377 --> 01:16.010
I mean you no harm.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.344
I have a message for you.

01:28.710 --> 01:30.344
RAMOS: Princess Ariadne.

01:30.377 --> 01:31.410
Run.

01:31.444 --> 01:32.544
Guards!

01:44.644 --> 01:46.510
There's nowhere left
for you to run.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.344
(THUD)

01:57.510 --> 01:59.084
-(ARROW STRIKES)
-(GROANS)

02:37.584 --> 02:39.417
Do we know who this man is?

02:39.450 --> 02:41.217
He has yet to regain
consciousness.

02:41.250 --> 02:44.350
I thought Princess Ariadne
might be able to tell us more.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.150
Ariadne.

02:47.184 --> 02:49.050
Did you recognise
the man who attacked you?

02:49.084 --> 02:51.484
I'd never seen him before.

02:51.517 --> 02:53.550
What became of him?
Did he escape?

02:53.584 --> 02:56.650
He was wounded by one
of the archers.

02:56.684 --> 02:58.784
Did this man
say anything to you?

02:58.817 --> 03:02.724
He demanded my jewellery
and said he would hurt me
if I did not comply.

03:03.457 --> 03:04.690
Mmm.

03:06.157 --> 03:08.424
He said nothing else?

03:08.457 --> 03:10.990
I'm not inclined to converse
with thieves.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.324
(CHUCKLES)

03:12.357 --> 03:15.190
Must have been
a terrible shock for you.
You look pale.

03:15.224 --> 03:16.490
You should get some sleep.

03:16.524 --> 03:19.724
Would you please
escort Ariadne
to her chambers?

03:24.924 --> 03:26.590
HEPTARIAN: Do you believe her?

03:26.624 --> 03:28.690
Why would a thief
attempt to steal
from the king's daughter?

03:28.724 --> 03:31.824
There are far easier
pickings in the city.

03:31.857 --> 03:33.457
No...

03:33.490 --> 03:37.524
Ariadne seemed more concerned
for the man's fate
than for her own safety.

03:37.557 --> 03:40.190
Then what did this man
want with her?

03:41.657 --> 03:44.624
We shall have to persuade him
to tell us.

03:46.557 --> 03:48.757
Do not fail me, my friend.

03:49.790 --> 03:52.024
Excuse me, sorry, sorry...

03:52.624 --> 03:54.057
(CHUCKLES)

03:57.990 --> 04:01.264
I can't believe you talked us
into betting what little money
we have on a beetle.

04:01.297 --> 04:04.197
-Hercules told me his beetle
has never lost a race.
-That's true.

04:04.230 --> 04:06.264
Never actually been in a race,
though, has it?

04:06.297 --> 04:10.830
That is also true,
but I swear to you,
it's as swift as an eagle.

04:10.864 --> 04:13.230
An eagle? Really?

04:13.264 --> 04:15.764
Well, maybe not that swift,
but it's swift for a beetle.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.664
We have to get our money back.

04:17.697 --> 04:19.430
Well, it's not all our money.

04:19.464 --> 04:22.097
I have some gold coins
hidden under the floorboards
in my chamber.

04:22.130 --> 04:25.497
You had some gold coins
under the floorboards
in your chamber.

04:25.530 --> 04:27.364
I have gambled them
on your behalf.

04:28.097 --> 04:29.697
-(KNOCKING)
-Oh...

04:29.730 --> 04:31.297
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:31.330 --> 04:33.663
(CROWD YELLING)

04:37.930 --> 04:40.764
Go on! Go on, run!
Run faster!

04:40.797 --> 04:42.864
Run faster, faster.

04:42.897 --> 04:47.064
I will squash you
like a fly. Go! Go!

04:47.097 --> 04:48.664
(ALL SHOUTING)

04:51.897 --> 04:53.297
Yes!

04:53.330 --> 04:55.330
We did it!
We did it!

04:55.364 --> 04:57.730
-We're rich!
-We did it!

04:58.497 --> 04:59.837
(DOOR OPENS)

05:05.970 --> 05:09.004
What is it you want with
the Princess Ariadne?

05:09.037 --> 05:11.770
-I meant to rob her.
-Hmm.

05:14.604 --> 05:16.770
I don't believe you.

05:19.237 --> 05:20.904
I can give you jewels.

05:21.670 --> 05:23.804
All you ever dreamed of.

05:24.670 --> 05:27.037
But you must
tell me the truth.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.204
I can give you jewels...

05:33.504 --> 05:36.270
...or pain. That is all.

05:36.304 --> 05:38.670
What is it you want
with Ariadne?

05:40.770 --> 05:42.704
I meant to rob her.

05:43.804 --> 05:46.170
Then you have
made your choice.

05:54.770 --> 05:57.204
Fetch me
when he's ready to talk.

05:58.504 --> 05:59.610
(SWORD SWISHING)

05:59.644 --> 06:01.144
(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

06:05.977 --> 06:07.644
Is there something
troubling you, Ariadne?

06:09.177 --> 06:12.944
I'm told the intruder
was caught,
he cannot harm you.

06:12.977 --> 06:14.777
He meant me no harm.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.877
There is something
I must ask of you.

06:20.977 --> 06:24.010
I would not do so
if it were not important.

06:28.244 --> 06:31.510
-What on earth are you doing?
-I'm fetching breakfast.

06:31.544 --> 06:33.444
I've seen him eat worse
when he's drunk.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.510
Not for me, you fool,
it's for Astrabacus.

06:35.544 --> 06:38.677
-Who's Astrabacus?
-It's the name
I've given to my beetle.

06:38.710 --> 06:40.110
You've named him?

06:40.144 --> 06:42.810
After his victory last night,
it's no less than he deserves.

06:42.844 --> 06:46.377
Astrabacus? You don't
think that's a little grand?
For a dung beetle?

06:46.410 --> 06:47.810
You may mock all you like,

06:47.844 --> 06:51.644
but Astrabacus is the most
valuable possession we have.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.844
That is truly depressing.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.250
Korinna!

06:59.284 --> 07:00.350
What are you doing here?

07:00.384 --> 07:02.950
I was hoping I might
speak with you.

07:02.984 --> 07:04.117
Alone.

07:05.184 --> 07:06.717
Yeah.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.450
I've received word
that the man I love

07:08.484 --> 07:10.750
is at the ruined palace
at Synas.

07:10.784 --> 07:13.717
I must journey there
if I am to see him.

07:14.584 --> 07:16.417
Why can't he come to Atlantis?

07:16.450 --> 07:18.417
He was accused of a crime
that he didn't commit

07:18.450 --> 07:20.450
and forced to flee the city.

07:20.484 --> 07:23.084
If he returns,
he faces imprisonment.

07:24.950 --> 07:26.384
The mountains
are full of robbers

07:26.417 --> 07:29.484
and it isn't safe for me
to travel alone.

07:29.517 --> 07:33.684
But if I don't go,
he will think
I have forsaken him.

07:33.717 --> 07:35.384
So you want me to escort you?

07:35.417 --> 07:38.350
I wouldn't ask
if there were any other way.

07:38.384 --> 07:40.584
It's been many months
since I've seen him.

07:40.617 --> 07:43.517
-Then I'll take you to him.
-Thank you.

07:54.580 --> 07:58.280
PASIPHAE: For whom
do you make an offering?

07:58.313 --> 08:02.153
I ask the gods
to look favourably
upon all those I care for.

08:05.587 --> 08:08.453
The intruder from
last night...

08:08.487 --> 08:12.887
It would seem that robbery
was not his true purpose.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.753
-He told you this himself?
-Not yet.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.253
But he shall talk
soon enough.

08:18.287 --> 08:20.887
I will leave you
to your prayers.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.753
What are you doing?

08:29.787 --> 08:31.887
I'm giving Astrabacus
some mountain air.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.487
It will make him strong.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.187
-You brought him with you?
-Where I go, he goes.

08:36.220 --> 08:39.153
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were in love.

08:39.187 --> 08:40.887
I heard you were in love
with Medusa.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.220
Has she said something?
Does she speak of me often?

08:43.253 --> 08:46.153
-No. Pythagoras told me.
-Did I?

08:46.953 --> 08:48.620
It may have slipped out.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.887
You'll have to
console yourself with the love
of your dung beetle.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.520
He's a better friend to me
than you.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.887
PASIPHAE: I admire
your courage.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.993
Lesser men would have
broken by now.

09:05.393 --> 09:06.860
I have told you all I know.

09:07.327 --> 09:08.627
We shall see.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.427
(PANTING)

09:17.427 --> 09:19.160
(PASIPHAE CHANTING)

09:21.093 --> 09:22.260
Please!

09:23.193 --> 09:25.760
No more!

09:25.793 --> 09:29.793
Tell me what it is
I wish to know
and I will end your pain.

09:29.827 --> 09:31.793
What is it you want
with Ariadne?

09:31.827 --> 09:33.527
(GROANS)

09:33.560 --> 09:36.493
I... I was to...

09:36.527 --> 09:38.760
I was to deliver a message.

09:40.127 --> 09:41.427
A message?

09:43.560 --> 09:44.693
Who was it from?

09:44.727 --> 09:46.027
(GROANING)

09:46.060 --> 09:49.760
It was from her brother.

09:54.293 --> 09:55.493
(GASPING)

09:56.493 --> 09:58.293
(WHISPERING) He's dead.

09:58.327 --> 10:01.367
-The prince lives.
-He is here? In Atlantis?

10:01.400 --> 10:02.900
He waits for her at Synas.

10:08.867 --> 10:11.433
You promised to end my pain.

10:15.033 --> 10:15.967
And I will.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.767
-(SWORD SWISHING)
-(SCREAMS)

10:25.733 --> 10:28.133
(CHANTING)

10:53.433 --> 10:55.833
You told me Therus was dead.

10:55.867 --> 10:59.033
How is it that
I've just learned
that he lives?

10:59.867 --> 11:03.207
I did not say
the prince was dead.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.607
-I said he was lost at sea.
-You deliberately misled me!

11:08.173 --> 11:10.207
The images I see
are not always clear.

11:13.407 --> 11:15.973
You must interpret them
as you can.

11:19.873 --> 11:22.607
And what else have you told me
that I can no longer trust?

11:22.640 --> 11:25.540
I speak the truth
when I tell you now

11:25.573 --> 11:30.373
that your hunger for power
will lead to bloodshed
and suffering.

11:31.373 --> 11:33.540
(LAUGHING)

11:33.573 --> 11:37.707
And you think you can stop me
with your lies and deceit?

11:39.707 --> 11:42.107
It is not I who will stop you.

11:49.107 --> 11:51.740
And what about
your own future? Hmm?

11:54.440 --> 11:56.240
What do you see for yourself?

11:59.840 --> 12:02.380
The gods will not allow me
to see my own destiny.

12:02.413 --> 12:06.347
Then do not make the mistake
of thinking that you are...

12:07.547 --> 12:09.047
untouchable.

12:12.147 --> 12:16.213
Mislead me again, and I shall
determine your fate for you.

12:27.813 --> 12:29.713
How can that be?
You told me Therus was dead.

12:29.747 --> 12:31.313
I believed it to be true.

12:31.347 --> 12:33.513
If Ariadne were to
learn the true reason
he fled Atlantis...

12:33.547 --> 12:35.213
I will not allow that
to happen.

12:35.247 --> 12:39.147
Take a squad of soldiers
to Synas. Kill Therus.
Burn his body.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.247
He is the king's son.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.380
Do you think Ariadne
will accept your hand
in marriage

12:45.413 --> 12:46.780
if she learns the truth?

12:46.813 --> 12:50.047
If you wish
to take the throne,
you will do as I say.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.313
They've been attacked
by thieves.

12:58.213 --> 13:00.947
Shouldn't we at least
bury the bodies?

13:00.980 --> 13:04.220
Mountain paths
are littered with corpses.

13:04.253 --> 13:06.187
We can't bury them all.

13:21.687 --> 13:23.787
My lord,
if I'm to give orders
to my men,

13:23.820 --> 13:25.620
I must know the nature
of our mission.

13:25.653 --> 13:28.020
It seems the intruder was part
of a plot to kidnap Ariadne.

13:28.053 --> 13:30.553
The other conspirators
are hiding out at Synas.

13:30.587 --> 13:33.087
Your men are to take
no prisoners.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.187
Do not fear, Ariadne.

13:47.220 --> 13:49.187
We've learned why the intruder
was in the palace.

13:50.053 --> 13:51.753
And why was that?

13:52.553 --> 13:55.020
He was sent by your brother.

13:55.053 --> 13:57.420
It seems the traitor
has returned.

13:57.453 --> 13:58.787
I do not believe
he is a traitor.

13:58.820 --> 14:01.060
Well, it's been hard
for all of us
to accept his betrayal,

14:01.093 --> 14:03.293
you more than anyone.

14:03.327 --> 14:07.060
Fortunately,
the intruder has told us
where Therus is hiding.

14:07.093 --> 14:09.893
Heptarian rides to Synas
as we speak.

14:11.193 --> 14:14.993
-What will Heptarian do
if he finds Therus?
-Ah, now...

14:15.027 --> 14:19.027
No. It's best not
to think about it.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.560
You've been through
quite an ordeal.

14:22.427 --> 14:24.593
Therus will soon be dead.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.593
This will all be over.

14:54.127 --> 14:57.227
-I will continue alone.
-Are you sure it's safe?

15:17.600 --> 15:18.867
(MUFFLED SCREAM)

15:18.900 --> 15:22.067
You cry out,
it'll be the last thing
you do.

15:22.100 --> 15:25.367
-Who are you?
-I bring word
from your sister.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.833
What are they doing in there?

15:32.867 --> 15:36.600
Really, Pythagoras?
Do I have to explain
with diagrams?

15:38.533 --> 15:41.067
They will not thank us
for interrupting them.

15:46.533 --> 15:48.567
You can trust them,
they're my friends.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.933
I'm ready to return
to Atlantis.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.633
Really? That was quick.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.733
The light's fading.

15:55.767 --> 15:58.467
The mountain paths
are too dangerous in the dark.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.940
We should make camp
for the night.

16:06.814 --> 16:08.248
MINOS: Ariadne.

16:08.881 --> 16:10.748
What is it?

16:10.781 --> 16:13.414
It's nothing.
I was just taking some air.

16:13.448 --> 16:15.381
What troubles you?

16:18.414 --> 16:20.581
I was thinking of Therus.

16:22.348 --> 16:26.248
There isn't a day that passes
when he does not
enter my thoughts.

16:26.281 --> 16:28.748
When I learned
of his betrayal...

16:30.648 --> 16:33.481
-There is no greater sadness.
-Therus loved
and respected you.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.014
I cannot believe
he meant you any harm.

16:35.048 --> 16:36.481
Those he plotted with
confessed.

16:36.514 --> 16:38.548
Why would he flee the city
if it were not true?

16:48.514 --> 16:52.848
With Therus gone,
you are more precious to me
than ever.

16:58.681 --> 17:01.014
I do not say it often enough.

17:13.521 --> 17:14.621
HERCULES: Hmm.

17:15.954 --> 17:17.554
What is it?

17:17.588 --> 17:19.321
I don't believe
they've ever been lovers.

17:19.354 --> 17:21.454
They've barely said two words
to each other.

17:23.221 --> 17:26.121
Why would Korinna lie to us?

17:26.154 --> 17:28.921
I don't know.
We should be on our guard.

18:06.796 --> 18:08.696
You would risk your life
for a beetle?

18:08.730 --> 18:10.330
He's like family to me.

18:12.230 --> 18:13.396
Go!

18:24.963 --> 18:27.930
What are soldiers from
Atlantis doing out here
in the middle of the night?

18:27.963 --> 18:30.496
They're here for you,
aren't they?

18:32.263 --> 18:35.463
For what crime
did you flee the city?

18:35.496 --> 18:39.696
I was accused of plotting
to kill my father, the King.

18:39.730 --> 18:41.996
You're Prince Therus?
The King's son?

18:43.196 --> 18:45.363
I know a hunting lodge
in the mountains.

18:45.396 --> 18:46.596
We'll be safe there.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.663
Great, now we're traitors.

18:53.696 --> 18:55.796
You know what they do
to traitors?

18:55.830 --> 18:58.030
I have a pretty good idea.

18:58.063 --> 18:59.696
You mean to tell me
he escaped?

18:59.730 --> 19:02.130
I have scouts searching
the mountains.
He will not get far.

19:06.670 --> 19:09.336
No.

19:09.370 --> 19:12.570
No, what Therus seeks is not
to be found in the mountains.
It is here...

19:14.470 --> 19:16.603
In Atlantis.

19:16.636 --> 19:18.870
-Ariadne?
-She will not be able
to resist

19:18.903 --> 19:20.470
the thought
of seeing her brother.

19:20.503 --> 19:23.103
She will lead us to him.

19:34.103 --> 19:36.236
Astrabacus needs
to build up his strength.

19:36.270 --> 19:40.170
Breakfast, most important
meal of the day.

19:40.203 --> 19:42.736
-Where are you going?
-I must go to Ariadne myself.

19:42.770 --> 19:44.536
It's too dangerous for you
to enter the city.

19:44.570 --> 19:46.903
-They'll be searching for you.
-It's the only way.

19:49.103 --> 19:51.303
We'll bring your sister
to you.

19:51.336 --> 19:54.836
Are you completely
out of your mind?

19:54.870 --> 19:58.203
You intend to smuggle
the Princess Ariadne
out of Atlantis,

19:58.236 --> 20:01.270
under the nose of the Queen
and the entire garrison?

20:01.303 --> 20:02.370
Yes.

20:03.610 --> 20:05.310
You would do this for me?

20:06.110 --> 20:08.976
I would do it for your sister.

20:09.010 --> 20:12.543
Surely after all
that has happened,
Ariadne will be under guard.

You won't be able
to get to her.

20:14.176 --> 20:16.143
I won't. Korinna will.

Wait at the servants' entrance
above the Northern Gate.

I'll send Ariadne to you.

20:45.076 --> 20:48.276
I was so worried for you,
I feared you'd been caught.

20:48.310 --> 20:52.676
-Therus, is he alive?
-Your brother is safe,
he's in the mountains.

20:52.710 --> 20:53.810
I must go to him.

20:53.843 --> 20:56.476
I believe that's
what's expected of you.

20:56.510 --> 20:57.776

she may have been abducted.

She cannot be allowed
to leave, I want her found.

21:51.883 --> 21:53.750
I will see to it.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.883
Ariadne must not reach
her brother.

She cannot be allowed
to learn the truth.

Is there something
troubling you?

22:19.056 --> 22:20.356
What is it?

22:21.890 --> 22:23.756
You could have told me
the truth about your brother.

22:24.690 --> 22:27.056
I would have gladly
helped you.

22:27.090 --> 22:30.156
You asked me and my friends
to risk our lives on a lie.

22:31.190 --> 22:34.390
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have done that.

22:34.423 --> 22:36.623
It's difficult for me to know
who I can trust.

tell the King.

confessed to
plotting with you?

to murder their families

if they didn't say
I was a traitor.
Those men were innocent.

32:50.686 --> 32:53.119
Pasiphae had them executed
to protect herself.

she desired the throne.

to protect me.

35:19.255 --> 35:20.621
Ariadne.

35:26.755 --> 35:28.155
Why are you doing this?

35:28.188 --> 35:30.721
Ariadne's life is in danger.
I have to take her away.

35:32.288 --> 35:33.355
(GRUNTS)

35:35.155 --> 35:37.588
If you will drug her,
she has no say in the matter.

35:37.621 --> 35:40.555
I have to protect her.
If you care for her at all,
you will let us go.

35:46.721 --> 35:49.121
I care for your sister more
than anything.

35:49.155 --> 35:50.888
I will not let you
take her against her will.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.055
Then I have no choice
but to kill you.

35:59.088 --> 36:00.755
I would gladly
give my life for her.

36:00.788 --> 36:02.955
I must do this. I'm sorry.

36:02.988 --> 36:04.155
No!

36:07.895 --> 36:10.395
Therus, I cannot go with you.

36:10.428 --> 36:12.528
I will not leave the people
to the mercy of Pasiphae.

36:12.561 --> 36:14.828
It is my duty
to stay in Atlantis.

36:14.861 --> 36:16.595
You'll be of no help
to the people
if you are dead.

36:16.628 --> 36:18.328
If it means
abandoning the city

36:18.361 --> 36:20.295
and turning my back
on those I care for,

36:23.795 --> 36:26.028
then I would rather be dead.

36:28.428 --> 36:30.128
Lower your sword.

36:35.528 --> 36:36.861
Please.

36:48.828 --> 36:50.161
You must go.

36:51.261 --> 36:52.928
And I must stay.

37:14.801 --> 37:17.768
I hope someday
I might be able to return.

37:17.801 --> 37:21.034
I wish for that
more than anything.

37:21.068 --> 37:23.201
I will send word when I can.

37:24.601 --> 37:27.135
Is he a part of the reason
you stay in Atlantis?

37:31.968 --> 37:35.968
As I said,
there are many people
I care for.

37:52.801 --> 37:55.535
Farewell, little sister.

38:01.101 --> 38:02.501
Farewell.

38:26.775 --> 38:28.741
I cannot thank you enough
for everything you've done.

38:33.175 --> 38:34.408
I must go.

38:40.075 --> 38:41.441
Ariadne.

38:49.141 --> 38:52.841
In the forest when Therus
had his sword to me,

38:52.875 --> 38:57.175
-how much of what I said
did you hear?
-Very little.

38:57.208 --> 38:59.508
I was still a little drowsy.

39:00.975 --> 39:02.675
What did you say?

39:03.275 --> 39:04.975
Nothing, really.

39:06.341 --> 39:08.381
No, I was just curious.

39:40.315 --> 39:41.848
PASIPHAE: Ariadne.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.115
Where have you been?

39:45.148 --> 39:47.581
The entire garrison has been
searching for you.

39:47.615 --> 39:50.703
If they thought to
look for me in the temple,
they would have found me

39:50.737 --> 39:52.003
consulting with the Oracle.

39:52.037 --> 39:54.337
I'm sorry if
I've caused you concern.

39:54.370 --> 39:57.137
And what did the Oracle
tell you of your future?

39:59.303 --> 40:02.303
She warned me
that I must be careful.

40:02.337 --> 40:04.703
It seems there are those
who plot against me.

40:07.103 --> 40:09.943
Do you really expect me
to believe that you were
with the Oracle?

40:09.977 --> 40:12.477
I no longer care
what you believe.

40:14.110 --> 40:16.710
I see you exactly
for what you are.

40:16.743 --> 40:18.110
(DOOR OPENS)

40:18.143 --> 40:20.843
I have been out of my mind!

40:20.877 --> 40:22.643
I feared something
had happened to you!

40:23.710 --> 40:25.043
I am perfectly safe.

40:25.077 --> 40:27.177
I cannot bear the thought
of any harm coming to you.

40:27.210 --> 40:30.443
-I love you more than
anything in this world.
-And I you.

40:30.477 --> 40:32.610
Come, let me walk you
to your chamber.

40:41.343 --> 40:44.610
We've been through a lot
these past few days,
you and I.

40:44.643 --> 40:49.377
I risked my life for yours,
now it's time for you
to repay that debt.

40:49.410 --> 40:50.643
(KNOCKING)

40:53.410 --> 40:54.643
Come on!

40:56.410 --> 40:57.977
(ALL CHEERING)

41:14.483 --> 41:16.183
What happened?

41:16.217 --> 41:19.050
I believe that's my shirt
you're wearing.

41:19.083 --> 41:21.050
You bet your shirt?

41:21.083 --> 41:22.783
I was confident of victory.

41:22.817 --> 41:24.950
Your shirt, if you will.

41:30.250 --> 41:33.150
What if the beetle we found
at the farmstead
wasn't Astrabacus

41:33.183 --> 41:35.783
-but an entirely
different beetle?
-You think of that now?

41:35.817 --> 41:36.950
Well, all beetles are alike.

41:36.983 --> 41:38.683
No, they're clearly
not all alike,

41:38.717 --> 41:42.583
otherwise I would not
be standing before you
without the shirt on my back.

41:44.150 --> 41:46.883
-What about your beetle?
-That is not my beetle.

41:46.917 --> 41:49.150
He is lazy, slow, and useless.

41:50.217 --> 41:53.083
Then I shall
call him Hercules.

42:00.817 --> 42:02.950
I wish to capture
the heart of the woman I love.

42:04.750 --> 42:07.057
<i>I've heard your powers</i>
<i>are unrivalled.</i>

42:09.590 --> 42:11.023

42:13.557 --> 42:14.490
