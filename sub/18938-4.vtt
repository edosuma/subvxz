crescent,

00:11.572 --> 00:13.372
and then come down,

00:13.372 --> 00:14.772
yeah, for a boat pose.

00:14.772 --> 00:16.505
- Can we all be brave adults,

00:16.505 --> 00:18.405
and just admit that babies
don't need yoga?

00:18.405 --> 00:20.338
All: Ohhh! Yeah.
(Babies coo and gurgle)

00:20.338 --> 00:21.572

okay, we can move on

00:24.272 --> 00:26.072
Yeah, who's got a new topic?

- I'm pregnant.

Alicia: Oooh, late May.

00:44.072 --> 00:46.538
Yikes.
- What?! What is it?

00:46.538 --> 00:48.538
- Well, are you worried
about a Taurus baby?

00:48.538 --> 00:49.738
- No, Alicia,

00:49.738 --> 00:51.772
I'm actually not worried
about a Taurus baby,

00:51.772 --> 00:53.672
I am worried about
ten million other things,

00:53.672 --> 00:55.438
like who the hell
is gonna take care

00:55.438 --> 00:57.205
of all of these tiny humans
I've decided to create.

00:57.205 --> 00:59.005
- Oh, sounds messy.

00:59.005 --> 01:01.438
- Anne, it sounds like you're
gonna need some extra help.

01:01.438 --> 01:03.205
Have you thought
about hiring a nanny?

01:03.205 --> 01:05.705
Jenny: Uh, Well, haven't we all
considered hiring a nanny?!

01:05.705 --> 01:07.105
Pretty luxurious, though.

01:07.105 --> 01:08.538
- Yeah, as soon as I start
making some green,

01:08.538 --> 01:10.238
you know I'm hiring a nanny.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.438
- Little tip though,
don't hire your mother.

01:12.438 --> 01:14.705
It gets very personal,
very quickly.

01:14.705 --> 01:16.538
- Ian's our nanny.

01:16.538 --> 01:20.172
And I'm pretty sure he's doing
nothing with our kid.

01:20.172 --> 01:22.005
- You try talking to him?

01:22.005 --> 01:23.338
- No...

01:23.338 --> 01:26.638
he's a writer, so he's better
with his words than me.

01:26.638 --> 01:28.072
- You wanna out talk Ian?

01:28.072 --> 01:29.305
Next time that he gives you
any trouble,

01:29.305 --> 01:32.172
you just attack him
with some "I" language.

01:32.172 --> 01:34.205
So basically, you phrase
everything in terms

01:34.205 --> 01:36.638
of how it's affecting you,
all while smiling,

01:36.638 --> 01:39.438
with soft eyes, even when
you're insulting him.

01:39.438 --> 01:40.605

01:40.605 --> 01:42.105

01:43.672 --> 01:46.138
How do you not know

01:46.138 --> 01:49.472
I feel like I am being
very clear.

01:49.472 --> 01:52.738
I'm worried that you may be
a slow person.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.072
- That'll work.
- I don't think that'll work.

01:55.072 --> 01:56.672

with a blowjob

Jenny: There you go.

02:46.705 --> 02:49.372

02:50.705 --> 02:52.705
that you just tidy up the house,

02:52.705 --> 02:56.338
feed the dog,

this stuff away,

until you find someone...

08:24.572 --> 08:26.105
uh, more suitable.

08:26.105 --> 08:27.438
- Thank you.

08:29.672 --> 08:31.272
(Laughs nervously)

08:32.638 --> 08:34.638
Woman on TV: I'm sick
of the way you treat me!

08:34.638 --> 08:36.005
- You've been drinking
too much tonight.

08:36.005 --> 08:37.405
- You have!
- Why are you coming up here?!

08:37.405 --> 08:40.005
You told me to leave!
- I did not!

08:40.005 --> 08:41.672
- Stop it!
Get out of the elevator!

08:41.672 --> 08:44.305
Woman on TV: Goodbye!
Get out of my space!

08:44.305 --> 08:47.205
- Why are you so aggressive?
- Get out!

08:48.472 --> 08:50.238
- Jesus!
- Did I scare you?

08:50.238 --> 08:52.238
I just wanted to hand off
the monitor.

08:52.238 --> 08:54.472
Jayme's sleeping.
- Mhmm...

08:54.472 --> 08:57.072
- You don't scare me.
- Cool.

08:57.072 --> 08:58.772
I'm gonna go pick up
Alice from school.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.272
- Cool.
Wait, isn't it early?

09:01.272 --> 09:02.705
- Well, I thought I'd stop
at the store,

09:02.705 --> 09:04.772
and pick up some fruits
and veggies first.

09:04.772 --> 09:07.138
There aren't any here
for after school snacks.

09:07.138 --> 09:09.472
- Huh, I could've sworn I saw
an apple around here somewhere.

09:09.472 --> 09:12.305
- I only found chips,
and other processed things.

09:12.305 --> 09:13.738
- Yeah, we must've blown
through all that healthy stuff

09:13.738 --> 09:16.105
on the weekend.
- Hmm.

09:16.105 --> 09:17.772
Anything I can grab
at the store for you?

09:17.772 --> 09:19.705
- Um, how about a couple
of carrots

09:19.705 --> 09:21.038
and celery, and...

09:21.038 --> 09:23.505
ack-cees... berries?
- Acai.

09:23.505 --> 09:24.772
- Yeah, you know what,
it's Lionel.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.405
that eats all that crap.

09:26.405 --> 09:28.105
- I totally get it.
- Mhmm, thanks.

09:28.105 --> 09:29.272
This is a really big help.

09:29.272 --> 09:31.305
It's so hard to keep this place
stocked up.

09:31.305 --> 09:32.405
- 'Kay. 'Kay.
- Mhmm.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.738
- See you lates!
- Late...s.

09:34.772 --> 09:37.605
(Door creaks open and shut)

09:39.438 --> 09:41.072
(Noisy crunching)

09:42.138 --> 09:43.705
(Keys clack)

09:46.272 --> 09:48.305
(Low hum of chatter)

09:48.305 --> 09:50.572
- Uh hey, you have a minute?

09:50.572 --> 09:52.638
- Uh... for you, of course.

09:54.272 --> 09:56.272
- I've noticed a significant
change...

09:56.272 --> 09:57.538
in your behavior,

09:57.538 --> 09:59.372
you've really been going
above and beyond lately.

09:59.372 --> 10:01.072
I mean, you've turned
your work in early,

10:01.072 --> 10:03.005
you've stayed late every night
this week.

10:03.005 --> 10:04.338
- So...

10:04.338 --> 10:06.238
you're happy with me?

10:06.238 --> 10:07.705
- Uh, yeah.

10:07.705 --> 10:10.238
- Knowing that I have
your support...

10:10.238 --> 10:12.505
makes me feel like
I can do anything.

10:12.505 --> 10:14.505
- (Gary sighs) I'm pretty
sure my productivity

10:14.505 --> 10:16.672
is at an all time high.

10:16.672 --> 10:18.305
It's worth mentioning.

10:18.305 --> 10:19.572
- Anyway, um,

10:19.572 --> 10:22.172
I was hoping if you had time
after work today,

10:23.638 --> 10:26.438
y-you'd want to have
a little--

10:26.438 --> 10:28.005
Ian: Jenny!

10:28.005 --> 10:29.605
- Ian! (Laughs)
- Hey, baby.

10:29.605 --> 10:30.738
- Hi...

10:31.772 --> 10:34.505
- We wanted to stop by,
see you in action.

10:34.505 --> 10:36.605
She said she wanted to see
her badass mommy at work.

10:36.605 --> 10:39.105
- Awww!

10:39.105 --> 10:42.105
- Hi, I'm Ian.

10:42.105 --> 10:43.238
Jenny's husband.

10:43.238 --> 10:44.572
- Oh! Yeah, yeah, hi.

10:44.572 --> 10:46.572
I'm Marvin, her department
manager, nice to meet you.

10:46.572 --> 10:48.472
- Marvin the manager.

10:48.472 --> 10:51.005
That's funny, I like that.
- Okay, honey, um...

10:51.005 --> 10:53.105
this is such a nice
surprise, but...

10:53.105 --> 10:55.005
isn't it almost her nap time?

10:55.005 --> 10:57.705
- Uh you know, she's pretty lax
about her schedule, actually.

10:57.705 --> 11:00.138
Hey, I was thinking the three
of us could grab some lunch.

11:00.138 --> 11:03.005
- Ian, it's almost four.
- Crap, okay, uh...

11:03.005 --> 11:04.538
coffee? She could use a coffee.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.705
- Uh, I should uh...
I should really dive back in.

11:06.705 --> 11:08.172
It was really nice
to meet you, Ian.

11:08.172 --> 11:09.205
- You too...
- Bye.

11:09.205 --> 11:11.038
- Marvin the manager.
- Okay.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.505
That is not funny.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.105
- Oh, come on, that's funny!

11:15.105 --> 11:17.238
As a writer, I can confirm
that that is very funny.

11:17.238 --> 11:20.272
- Look, I am serious here,
this is my place of business.

11:20.272 --> 11:22.772
- All right, it just feels
like you're kinda you know,

11:22.772 --> 11:24.605
maybe hiding something.
- No!

11:24.605 --> 11:27.238
I'm just trying to be
professional here,

11:27.238 --> 11:30.138
and it's hard to do that
when you two show up.

11:30.138 --> 11:31.338
- Okay.

11:31.338 --> 11:34.405
- I'm sorry, I feel bad.
- We'll go. It's okay.

11:34.405 --> 11:36.005
Don't worry about it.

11:36.005 --> 11:37.705
See you at home.

11:40.305 --> 11:41.738
- (Sighs heavily)
- That counts as your 15.

11:41.738 --> 11:44.072
- Okay!

11:44.072 --> 11:46.372
- I read that she was actually
sick on an elderly lady.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.005
She claims she had
motion sickness.

11:48.005 --> 11:49.538
- Code for mixing pills
and booze.

11:49.538 --> 11:51.072
- Probably.

11:51.072 --> 11:53.005
- She's a bestselling author,
and a mother of four,

11:53.005 --> 11:54.272
how hard could it be?

11:54.272 --> 11:55.572
- Someone tweeted a pic of her
roaming coach,

11:55.572 --> 11:58.572
talking to strangers...
I smell an addict.

11:58.572 --> 12:00.272
- It's not our job to judge,
just fix it.

12:00.272 --> 12:02.005
Who's up for restoring
her image?

12:02.005 --> 12:04.105
- Oh, I can handle this.

12:04.105 --> 12:05.738
- I can handle this too.

12:05.738 --> 12:07.538
- How about both of you
work on it?

12:07.538 --> 12:10.072
- I really don't need any help,
pretty straightforward job.

12:10.072 --> 12:12.705
Rosie: Oh, sorry to interrupt,
um, Kate?

12:12.705 --> 12:15.372
You have a phone call.
- Oh, uh, take a message.

12:15.372 --> 12:17.172
- Actually, it's your mum.

12:17.172 --> 12:18.638
- Take a message please, Rosie.

12:18.638 --> 12:21.105
- She was bit by your dog.

12:21.105 --> 12:23.005
- (Mo laughs)

12:24.105 --> 12:25.572
Oh, wow.

12:25.572 --> 12:28.372
Looks like your afternoon
just got busy, Kate.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.538
Don't worry about it,

12:29.538 --> 12:32.472
take care of your mom.
I got this.

12:35.372 --> 12:36.738

are you okay?

12:49.338 --> 12:53.238
- Well, I am now, thanks
to this wonderful doctor.

12:53.238 --> 12:55.672
You know, he and his wife
are having a little baby too.

12:55.672 --> 12:57.138
A little girl.

12:57.138 --> 12:59.638
Kate wants a little girl,
but she's just so busy.

12:59.638 --> 13:01.372

13:01.372 --> 13:03.438
Congrats on your baby,
is my mom okay?

13:03.438 --> 13:06.005
- Yeah, she will be fine.
The dog did break the skin,

13:06.005 --> 13:07.772
so I provided her with
a tetanus shot...

13:07.772 --> 13:09.172
and a Band-Aid.

13:09.172 --> 13:11.772
- And I'll take some of that
pain medication.

13:11.772 --> 13:14.672
- Well good, yeah,
whatever gets her through it.

13:14.672 --> 13:16.705
- Eleanor, that must've been
really scary.

13:16.705 --> 13:18.172
- It was, Nathan.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.605
It was very scary.

13:19.605 --> 13:21.405
I thought, well,
if this is it,

13:21.405 --> 13:24.272
I can at least protect
the baby on my way out.

13:24.272 --> 13:26.338
I love him so dearly.

13:27.772 --> 13:30.305
- Uh Mom, I'm so sorry
about earlier,

13:30.305 --> 13:33.138
please stay on with us.

13:33.138 --> 13:35.472
It's so good for Charlie
to be around his grandmother.

13:35.472 --> 13:37.105
- You know I hate that word.

13:37.105 --> 13:39.105
- Well, until you can think
of an alternative.

13:39.105 --> 13:42.172
- You know, Kate, I don't know
why you love that dog so much.

13:42.172 --> 13:44.438
Sometimes I think you have more
intimacy with that dog

13:44.438 --> 13:47.038
than you do with your own
husband. (Laughs)

13:49.472 --> 13:51.238
- Okay, we're all done here.

13:51.238 --> 13:53.005
Try to take it easy
the next couple days.

13:53.005 --> 13:54.172
Call me if you have
any complications.

13:54.172 --> 13:56.438
Kate: Thank you.
Eleanor: All right.

13:56.438 --> 14:00.072
Kate: You know, Mom,
Nathan loves Olly too.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.672
Nathan?
- Hmm?

14:01.672 --> 14:02.672
Oh, I--
- The dog!

14:02.672 --> 14:05.238
- Yeah, I mean...
I do love Olly.

14:05.238 --> 14:06.505
It's just--
- You see? You see that?

14:06.505 --> 14:08.638
- See what?!
It's just what, Nathan?!

14:08.638 --> 14:10.505
- Well, it's just that
he's a biter now,

14:10.505 --> 14:12.638
and I don't think there's
any coming back from that.

14:12.638 --> 14:15.005
- Well, he was just being
protective,

14:15.005 --> 14:16.305
you know, and-and...

14:16.305 --> 14:17.738
and Mom, are you sure
you weren't asking for it,

14:17.738 --> 14:20.305
maybe just a little bit?
You know, you can do some...

14:20.305 --> 14:22.205
dramatic hand gestures that
might trigger something,

14:22.205 --> 14:24.672
or you do a whispery voice
that puts some people on edge,

14:24.672 --> 14:27.005
I'm just saying.
- Kate, come on.

14:27.005 --> 14:28.738
- What? I'm saying, her skin
is basically tissue paper,

14:28.738 --> 14:30.738
I've seen her cut it
on a spoon!

14:30.738 --> 14:32.705
- Can we please do this
some other time?!

14:32.705 --> 14:34.072
We both have to get back
to work.

14:34.072 --> 14:36.072
- Well, I guess you're right,
Kate.

14:36.072 --> 14:39.705

vigilant, that's all.

a bunch of perfectly good food,

all over the world.

would be a whole lot better

Look at you,
you're "skinny-fat".

- Another late night, huh?

16:51.238 --> 16:53.305
- I had work to do.

16:53.305 --> 16:54.772
Have you eaten yet?

16:54.772 --> 16:56.438
- Yeah.

16:56.438 --> 16:58.038
I made us meatloaf.

16:58.038 --> 17:00.572
- Oh, that sounds good!

17:00.572 --> 17:02.505
Where is it?

17:02.505 --> 17:05.405
- Well Jenny, I uh, ate it.

17:05.405 --> 17:08.638
I was waiting, but you were
taking so long,

17:08.638 --> 17:11.072
and yeah, it was really good.

17:12.405 --> 17:14.738
- You ate an entire meatloaf?

17:14.738 --> 17:17.338
- Don't do that!
- What?

17:17.338 --> 17:19.205
- Don't humiliate me!

17:19.205 --> 17:21.038
It's bad enough that
I gotta sit around here

17:21.038 --> 17:23.438
waiting for you,
cooking and cleaning.

17:23.438 --> 17:26.372
- Hmm, you cleaned?
- Yeah!

17:26.372 --> 17:28.272
- So is she asleep?
- Yeah.

17:28.272 --> 17:30.238
I put her down at six.

17:30.238 --> 17:31.772
- Hm, that seems early.

17:31.772 --> 17:34.005
- Look, you can't just come
in here at crazy hours,

17:34.005 --> 17:35.538
and start criticizing me,
Jenny!

17:35.538 --> 17:37.005
- It's eight!

17:37.005 --> 17:40.005
- Yeah well, I have been
working my ass off,

17:40.005 --> 17:42.572
and I just, I needed
a little "me" time.

17:42.572 --> 17:45.072
- I totally get it.
- Thank you.

17:45.072 --> 17:47.338
- Did you get some writing done?

17:47.338 --> 17:49.072
- Yeah. Of course.

17:49.072 --> 17:51.438
- Can I see it?
- You're unbelievable!

17:51.438 --> 17:53.305
I know what you're up to
at work, okay?!

17:53.305 --> 17:54.472
I'm not an idiot, Jen!

17:54.472 --> 17:57.005
- Okay, this seems
a little paranoid. I--

17:57.005 --> 18:00.038
- Just- just...
don't look at me,

18:00.038 --> 18:02.105
you're giving me dragon eyes.

18:02.105 --> 18:05.038
- Dragon eyes?
- Yes, the dragon eyes.

18:05.038 --> 18:07.072
It's something that I've
introduced into my screenplay.

18:07.072 --> 18:09.005
You'd know if you asked
once in a while!

18:09.005 --> 18:12.038
- Seriously? Ian, I just did!

18:12.038 --> 18:13.305
Ian!

18:16.472 --> 18:18.505
Ohhhh...

- Kate.

19:43.105 --> 19:45.138
- It's so clean in here!

19:45.138 --> 19:47.072
- Well, I thought you might
like to come home

19:47.072 --> 19:48.638
to that for a change.

19:48.638 --> 19:50.305
- What's that I'm smelling?

19:50.305 --> 19:51.572
- Can't you guess?
- (Gasps)

19:51.572 --> 19:53.772
Did you make spaghetti?
- Oh!

19:53.772 --> 19:56.338
You just sounded like when
you were a little girl.

19:56.338 --> 19:57.572
- Mm! Hot!

19:57.572 --> 19:59.372
- Let me do that.
- Mmm!

19:59.372 --> 20:02.372
- Let me help you just
slow down for once.

20:02.372 --> 20:04.505
- Mmm, oh, you don't have
to do all that!

20:04.505 --> 20:06.605
- (Blows)

20:06.605 --> 20:08.538
I like doing things for you.

20:08.538 --> 20:09.572
- Mmm!

20:11.772 --> 20:13.705
- This is nice.
- Yeah!

20:15.305 --> 20:18.138
- (Sighs)
- Is uh, Charlie's down?

20:19.138 --> 20:21.138
- Right on schedule.
- Mhm.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.038
- Nathan?
- Not home yet.

20:24.038 --> 20:25.738
- Hmm.

20:32.505 --> 20:34.572
Where's Olly?

20:37.305 --> 20:38.705
Mom, where's Olly?!
- Hmm?

20:38.705 --> 20:40.405
- My dog?

20:40.405 --> 20:41.605
- I put him out.

20:41.605 --> 20:44.005
- What, Uh...
what does that mean?

20:44.005 --> 20:45.138
- He's outside now.

20:46.138 --> 20:47.605
- He's not an outside dog!

20:47.605 --> 20:50.072
- Kate, all dogs
are outside dogs.

20:50.072 --> 20:51.238
- He doesn't know that!

20:51.238 --> 20:52.705
- Well, if I can't leave him
in the garage,

20:52.705 --> 20:54.372
and I can't tie to him a tree,

20:54.372 --> 20:56.738
where is that dog
supposed to live?!

20:56.738 --> 20:58.172
- In my house, Mom!

20:59.172 --> 21:01.572
You tied him to a tree?!

21:01.572 --> 21:02.705
(Sighs)

21:02.705 --> 21:05.038
(Olly pants)

21:05.038 --> 21:07.172
- I put a plushy blanket
out for him.

21:07.172 --> 21:09.238
It was practically cashmere.

21:09.238 --> 21:10.772
- Don't even!
