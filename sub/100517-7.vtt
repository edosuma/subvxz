WEBVTT

00:53.970 --> 00:55.555
No, they're all gone.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.768
Particle's signature
consistent with Angelfire.

01:10.278 --> 01:14.115
All these stacks.
This has got to be Joshua Kemp.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.701
Not anymore.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.502
Negative on the fugitives.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.337
There's no sign of them.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.014
Wait a minute! I've got something.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.153
We've got a survivor!

01:57.117 --> 02:00.161
-Is he the only one alive?
- The only one at the scene.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.665
Falconer and the others
are still unaccounted for.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.585
Incredible.

02:09.879 --> 02:12.048
They were right in the path of its beam.

02:13.091 --> 02:16.678
Everything around them destroyed,
including the ground under their feet.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.222
And they walked away.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.266
Or drove away.

02:22.934 --> 02:26.146
We just got word.
Captain Veutin's transport is missing.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.356
I want that vehicle found.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.234
Look, do you want it or not?

02:31.317 --> 02:34.195
How the fuck am I supposed
to hawk a Protectorate transport?

02:34.279 --> 02:36.656
Strip it. Sell it in parts.
You'll figure it out.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.575
Do you have what I asked for?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.618
You're lucky I'm feeling thirsty today.

02:40.702 --> 02:44.664
-I don't usually make house calls.
-Too bad. Bar is closed.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.416
Easy, quick draw.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.544
How's that pile of scrap
they call your father?

02:49.627 --> 02:52.797
-Why? He owe you money?
- He always owes me money.

02:53.131 --> 02:56.467
But he never misses a poker game.
Thought you might know something.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.721
What do I look like, his social secretary?
Give it to me.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.058
No more paying me in shit!

03:11.649 --> 03:12.650
How is she?

03:12.984 --> 03:15.320
She's burning up. Did you get it?

03:16.279 --> 03:17.447
Portable nanoswarm.

03:18.239 --> 03:21.576
-Let's hope it works.
-Make the call. We're gonna need help.

03:27.248 --> 03:30.418
I've come to check on the patient.
Miss Dig...

03:31.544 --> 03:34.964
you are meant to be recuperating.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.801
I'm almost finished with the program
I promised you.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.970
I just need to run a few tests.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.097
I do not think that's important right now.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.975
You have been the victim
of a heinous offense,

03:46.226 --> 03:48.686
the torture of which I can hardly imagine.

03:49.520 --> 03:53.775
My functions
are all intact. There's no lasting damage.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.825
Not all damage is corrupted code.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.786
I'm not the one you should be
worrying about.

04:06.371 --> 04:07.997
Have you heard anything?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.917
Mr. Kovacs has not returned
our messages, but...

04:11.834 --> 04:14.921
there is a report of an explosion
in an outlying forest.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.925
I prefer to focus on you.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.472
What's this?

04:24.555 --> 04:27.684
It's a gesture of care
exchanged by humans.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.604
Of course, AIs do not require sustenance.
It's more of an...

04:32.855 --> 04:33.815
an approximation.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.818
It's not very practical.

04:36.901 --> 04:37.902
Ah.

04:41.948 --> 04:46.953
It is the impractical things
in this tumultuous hellscape of a world...

04:48.621 --> 04:49.831
that matter most.

04:51.124 --> 04:55.086
A book, a name, chicken soup.
They help us remember...

04:57.422 --> 04:59.299
that even in our darkest hour...

05:02.510 --> 05:04.595
life is still to be savored.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.851
I don't need soup for that.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.104
I have you.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.025
Yes.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.362
That is true.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.490
But...

05:26.159 --> 05:28.411
in my experience with Miss Elizabeth,

05:28.828 --> 05:31.622
it was not only the psychosurgery
that helped her cope with her trauma,

05:33.291 --> 05:36.044
it was the sheer act of facing it.

05:36.627 --> 05:40.715
So perhaps I could help you
comb over the files.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.425
That isn't necessary. I'm...

05:43.134 --> 05:44.761
fine.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.347
Ignoring what happened won't--

05:50.975 --> 05:52.852
-Poe, are you glitching?
-No, it's Miss Trepp.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.813
She's interfacing with a nanoswarm.
It appears she's in dire need.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.489
Good heavens, Miss Falconer.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.407
She needs a doctor.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.701
All Archaeologue AIs
have medical programming.

06:09.285 --> 06:10.244
What happened?

06:10.328 --> 06:14.040
One minute she was fine, the next she was
calling Angelfire down from the sky.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.918
Impossible. No human's been able
to control an Orbital.

06:17.001 --> 06:17.960
She did.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.337
It almost killed her.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.382
Her sleeve is breaking down.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.387
The diagnostics are processing.
It shouldn't take long.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.016
Perhaps I may garner a brief word?

06:35.812 --> 06:39.315
Since our paths last crossed,
I, too, went on a journey.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.527
-Brief, Poe.
-I infiltrated the Renouncers' construct.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.946
I assure you
they are perpetrating a fallacy.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.198
Aren't you quite the detective?

06:48.533 --> 06:50.201
Konrad Harlan is not there.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.703
-Where is he at?
-This I have not yet discovered.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.122
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.666
Miss Falconer's sleeve is shutting down.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.960
But the problem
stems from her stack. Look.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.964
These red strands,
I've never seen anything like it.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.298
I have.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.844
In Tanaseda's stack,
when his DHF was decaying.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.345
There's someone else.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.347
Anil.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.474
His stack has it too.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.563
If I could find out what happened to him,
maybe we can save them both.

07:36.664 --> 07:39.333
I got your message.
Are you sure that it's true?

07:39.834 --> 07:40.793
I saw it happen.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.255
But Angelfire has never
touched ground before.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.715
Open your mind, Stone.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.884
This is a flash point.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.762
The breadth of human knowledge
expanding in an instant.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.600
Yesterday, wielding an Elder weapon
was unthinkable.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.768
Not today.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.397
Quellcrist Falconer just changed
the course of history.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.901
Dealing out real death,
controlling an Orbital.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.946
No person has ever possessed
that much power with that much precision.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.323
It's what we've been waiting for.

08:10.406 --> 08:13.993
The Protectorate can't dictate terms
whilst staring down fire.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.871
Find me an Archaeologue.

08:16.954 --> 08:19.540
I need an expert on Elder technology.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.417
See if this means anything.

08:21.876 --> 08:22.960
It will be difficult.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.545
I need to know how she did it.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.924
Falconer may be the first
to master the Orbitals,

08:28.007 --> 08:29.717
but she won't be the last.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.389
Be careful.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.227
-You have no idea what state he's in.
-Whatever it is, I need to find out.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.231
Dig will monitor your brain waves.
If it gets dicey,

08:43.731 --> 08:44.774
I'll pull you out.

08:55.576 --> 08:56.827
<i> I can't...</i>

08:56.911 --> 08:58.955
<i>I can't hold it.</i>

08:59.580 --> 09:01.999
-Anil?
- <i>I'm getting a reading.</i>

09:02.083 --> 09:05.461
- <i>Think it's Protectorate tech?</i>
- <i>How should I know?</i>

09:05.545 --> 09:07.129
-Anil.
- <i>Are you sure it's safe?</i>

09:07.213 --> 09:08.923
<i>We don't know what tech's</i>
<i>on the other side.</i>

09:09.006 --> 09:12.218
<i>My sister would know.</i>
<i>She's a wizard with those coils.</i>

09:12.802 --> 09:16.097
- <i>You should've brought her.</i>
<i>-Nah.</i> <i>Trepp's no Quellist.</i>

09:16.180 --> 09:18.683
<i>Only thing she believes in</i>
<i>is herself and getting paid upfront.</i>

09:20.017 --> 09:20.851
That's not true.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.312
<i>What'd she say when you told her</i>
<i>you were gonna join us?</i>

09:23.396 --> 09:26.649
<i>I didn't. She spent her whole life</i>
<i>putting up with my shit.</i>

09:27.692 --> 09:30.820
<i>Besides, this is my chance</i>
<i>to change the Settled Worlds.</i>

09:50.006 --> 09:51.173
<i>Can't hold it...</i>

09:54.760 --> 09:57.305
- <i>Look out!</i>
- <i>What the hell?</i>

10:08.149 --> 10:09.108
<i>It's her.</i>

10:09.191 --> 10:11.068
<i>Call Kemp. It's Falconer!</i>

10:11.736 --> 10:12.820
He woke her up.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.578
- <i>What happened?</i>

10:24.415 --> 10:26.208
-<i>It's in me!</i>
- Anil, don't!

10:28.878 --> 10:30.630
<i>I can't...</i>

10:32.798 --> 10:34.425
<i>can't hold it.</i>

10:48.981 --> 10:50.816
He found her.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.612
-It was Quell.
-What do you mean he found her?

10:55.446 --> 10:57.448
She was in cryo.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.784
All hell broke loose.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.037
Something got in him and he...

11:03.579 --> 11:05.122
he couldn't hold it.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.417
His mind...

11:10.044 --> 11:11.337
is broken.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.423
Did he say anything else?

11:16.300 --> 11:17.718
I tried...

11:18.511 --> 11:20.513
and he couldn't hear me.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.265
There was screaming.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.738
- <i>You finally see me.</i>
- <i>To find Miss Falconer...</i>

11:37.822 --> 11:40.408
<i>or the dastardly sleeve-jacker</i>
<i>who's inhabiting her.</i>

11:41.575 --> 11:44.328
<i>Can you hear them?</i>
<i>Do you hear the screams?</i>

11:44.412 --> 11:45.955
<i>Someone else is riding her sleeve.</i>

11:46.038 --> 11:47.331
I can't stop it! I can't hold it!

11:47.748 --> 11:49.250
-I'm not here for you.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.295
"I'm not here for you."

11:54.171 --> 11:57.007
When we got here, you said
someone else was riding her sleeve.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.135
-I was mistaken.
-What if you weren't?

11:59.593 --> 12:01.345
Anil said something got into him.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.638
What if it was someone?

12:03.055 --> 12:05.975
Another consciousness invaded
from the outside?

12:06.058 --> 12:07.727
Two minds in the same stack?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.520
It would explain her two personas.

12:09.603 --> 12:12.189
You can't put two DHFs in one stack.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.108
It would take everything to hold it,

12:14.400 --> 12:15.276
even her memory.

12:16.110 --> 12:19.488
But Quell spent her entire life pushing
the boundaries of the human mind.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.032
If anyone could survive, it would be her.

12:22.116 --> 12:26.328
If you are correct, perhaps it was not
Miss Falconer who rained Angelfire down...

12:28.122 --> 12:29.290
but the invader.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.876
If someone can get in,
there must be a way to get them out.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.002
We could use VR.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.920
Build a construct.

12:35.004 --> 12:38.215
Upload everything
from Miss Falconer's stack, good and bad.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.759
But the data's intertwined.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.135
We'll tear her in half.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.762
We could spin her down first.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.181
Her DHF is connected
to her organic sleeve,

12:45.264 --> 12:46.849
so it will lie dormant.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.144
-But the invader--
-It would remain in the construct.

12:50.227 --> 12:53.105
We can build a firewall around it,
leave it trapped in VR.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.023
And what about Quell?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.442
Then we spin her up.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.028
-It's brilliant.
- It's fucking insane.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.490
-What you're proposing could kill her.
-And if we do nothing?

13:06.368 --> 13:07.620
Get started on the construct.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.514
Time for my execution already?

13:27.014 --> 13:28.849
Circumstances have changed.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.108
You lost them. Again.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.402
Bring them in
and I'll commute your sentence.

13:40.486 --> 13:44.240
You revived the most dangerous insurgency
in the Settled Worlds.

13:45.282 --> 13:49.745
You hoarded alloy from the Protectorate
so you could profit off an inflated price.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.956
The Protectorate was raping this planet.

13:52.039 --> 13:55.125
They wanted us to bow and scrape
when we own

13:55.209 --> 13:57.920
the most valuable resource there is.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.129
Someone had to do something.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.383
So you created a smokescreen.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.844
Kemp was my creation, it's true.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.096
But his followers are real.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.599
Now, Falconer has returned,
Angelfire in hand,

14:10.683 --> 14:12.726
with the Last Envoy at her side.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.396
Do you know what that means?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.525
They will reignite The Uprising.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.943
Not if we stop them.

14:22.653 --> 14:27.116
Your sham of a war is an insult
to every soldier who died fighting it.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.119
Why would I <i>ever</i> help you?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.414
Because I know what you want...

14:35.457 --> 14:36.458
Jaeger.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.796
I left that name behind a long time ago.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.216
Not by choice.
The Protectorate took it from you.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.470
After you unleashed the Rawling Virus
on Stronghold,

14:48.554 --> 14:50.431
you were supposed to be a hero,

14:51.265 --> 14:52.391
a legend.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.103
Instead they made you nothing.

14:57.771 --> 15:00.107
We have more in common than you think.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.068
The Protectorate wants to make us small.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.321
We are not.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.241
This is your chance to finish
your mission.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.660
And if I refuse?

15:11.744 --> 15:16.081
Then you're just another drone
consigned to the dustbin of history.

15:17.082 --> 15:20.169
But deliver Kovacs and Falconer to me,

15:21.170 --> 15:25.257
and every child on Harlan's
will know of the great Jaeger.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.385
I am offering you your legacy.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.347
Hell, I'll make the damn statues myself.

15:33.974 --> 15:38.479
I'll even let you keep that copy
of Takeshi Kovacs you like so much.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.939
He's alive?

15:42.107 --> 15:44.151
He's in the medical bay as we speak.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.445
He's yours...

15:47.571 --> 15:48.781
if you say yes.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.674
Hey, Myka.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.258
It's me.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.304
Guess you got my message
about closing the bar. That's good.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.059
I, uh...

16:18.394 --> 16:19.561
I found Anil.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.359
What's left of him.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.696
I was, um...

16:29.780 --> 16:30.990
too late.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.330
I don't really know what to do now, um...

16:39.581 --> 16:41.291
<i>I just wanted to hear your voice.</i>

16:41.375 --> 16:43.460
Spot check. ONIs off.

16:47.965 --> 16:48.799
Turn around.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.302
It's okay.
They just want to scan your stack.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.392
You're next.

17:03.313 --> 17:04.231
Come on.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.816
- I need you to go with them.
-What? Why?

17:05.899 --> 17:07.276
-Mom!
- Governor's orders.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.779
- No, I'm not leaving my son!
-He's going, too. Next!

17:14.950 --> 17:15.826
Leave.

17:24.668 --> 17:27.296
I thought we'd both be arrested
for double sleeving by now.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.256
The Governor has other priorities.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.842
She trusts me to execute mine.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.392
Wanna tell me what happened?

17:40.476 --> 17:43.771
Guess this fancy new sleeve paid off.
Rapid healing kicked in.

17:43.854 --> 17:44.897
I mean Kovacs.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.983
You turned off your COMM, went dark.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.528
I was a prisoner.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.449
I needed to get them to trust me.
I severed the link so they would.

17:55.532 --> 17:58.327
-You were with them in the woods.
-I was staying on mission.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.829
Falconer torched me with Angelfire
and left me for dead.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.790
You really think I'd turn for her?

18:02.873 --> 18:06.043
You did once before.
What's to say you didn't do it again?

18:08.670 --> 18:10.380
I'll prove my loyalty.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.426
When I was tracking Kovacs,

18:15.052 --> 18:17.805
I came across his AI,
put a tag in her code.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.058
If Kovacs is out there, he'll need help.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.602
We can use her to track him.

18:29.900 --> 18:30.734
Show me.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.538
How are you feeling?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.832
I'm almost through with the construct.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.042
Then we can upload Miss Falconer's DHF.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.628
I was inquiring about you.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.630
Are you sure you're up to this?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.716
Someone broke into her mind.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.260
Violated her.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.514
Whoever's in there has to pay
for what they've done.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.811
-Perhaps I could be of assistance?
-It's too delicate.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.729
We can't risk you glitching.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.773
I can do this, Poe.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.234
I have to.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.951
Here. You can use these on Quell.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.787
We're gonna need another set.
I'm going in too.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.539
Inside the construct?

19:25.622 --> 19:28.917
There's gonna be someone in there.
I can distract them, draw their focus,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.128
make sure they don't notice
the firewall we're building.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.838
I get you have a death wish.

19:33.297 --> 19:37.384
But if you expose your DHF,
whoever's in there can invade you.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.179
Dig's gonna need time to work
and I'm gonna give it to her.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.432
And besides, I owe her a good fight,
not just for Quell, but...

19:44.516 --> 19:45.559
for your brother too.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.688
The construct's up and running.

19:49.771 --> 19:50.939
Preparing for transfer.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.571
We tracked your tag.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.824
We can see the programs the AI's running,
but the server location is encrypted.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.577
Decrypt it.
Break through the security protocols.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.496
Colonel, that could take weeks.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.416
-What's that over there?
- A VR construct.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.251
Looks like the AI is supporting it.

20:12.336 --> 20:15.923
If we could get inside, establish a link,
we could backtrace her server,

20:16.465 --> 20:18.717
-find them in the real.
- I suppose that's possible.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.845
I could upload your DHF, but you would
have to find your own way around.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.308
Send me in. I'll be the anchor.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.853
-Not alone. I'm going with you.
-You don't trust me?

20:30.229 --> 20:31.730
I learn from my mistakes.

20:32.856 --> 20:33.857
So do I.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.863
For your sake, I hope that's true.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.244
- Poe?
-Sir?

20:45.911 --> 20:48.497
You don't have to call me that.
You don't work for me anymore.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.915
Yes. I'm well aware.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.044
Oh, was that all?

20:54.628 --> 20:58.840
Going to the Renouncers,
that was a risk.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.636
But you took it,
just like you're taking one now.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.223
And I know I've been impatient.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.724
That's putting it mildly.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.059
Okay. I've been an asshole.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.645
-But you still came.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.814
Well, as you can see...

21:15.190 --> 21:16.316
I'm rather invested.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.527
Good. 'Cause I'm gonna need you.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.656
Now, we both know my life
isn't worth much, but hers is.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.908
So I'm gonna trust you with it.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.453
Poe, I need you to keep her alive.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.542
Yes, sir.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.548
I'm spinning her sleeve down.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.051
Miss Falconer's DHF
will be uploaded first, then yours.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.345
It will be a neutral construct.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.729
Initiating transfer.

21:55.856 --> 21:58.191
Whatever is inside her, it's still active.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.863
Don't take me out
until the firewall is finished.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.365
Godspeed, sir.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.428
So much for neutral.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.605
I know you're in here.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.745
Daddy? What's wrong?

23:02.964 --> 23:03.924
We need light.

23:09.596 --> 23:13.266
We're underground. Why would they
build a construct like this?

23:13.350 --> 23:15.268
Hold on, soldier. I'm taking lead.

23:20.607 --> 23:21.650
Who are you?

23:21.733 --> 23:24.403
Put that down, Tak. You know the rules.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.822
No weapons in the nursery.

23:29.324 --> 23:32.285
-And you're supposed to be asleep.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.663
Come here, girl. Get in this bed.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.581
Oh...

23:36.832 --> 23:38.375
-Come on.
- Night, night.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.377
Good night.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.922
She's a little troublemaker.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.884
Who do you think she gets that from?

23:48.427 --> 23:49.594
You or me?

23:51.388 --> 23:53.306
They said you'd be spun down.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.394
They don't know what they don't know.

24:00.897 --> 24:02.023
Look at her.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.068
Children light the future.

24:06.194 --> 24:07.821
Without them, everything is dark.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.785
This isn't our future.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.371
It could be.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.418
Part of you wants it.

24:23.753 --> 24:24.796
But Quell doesn't.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.507
You aren't her.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.509
You don't belong here.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.637
You're so wrong.

24:33.513 --> 24:37.100
I am the only one
who belongs here.

24:46.318 --> 24:49.571
-The code, it's shifting.
- What about the firewall?

24:50.655 --> 24:52.741
It's still here.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.368
The progress I've made is intact.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.496
I need to move faster.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.706
-Myka?

25:01.416 --> 25:02.542
Where are you?

25:03.418 --> 25:04.836
<i>-Mom?</i>
-TJ?

25:04.920 --> 25:06.796
What's going on?
Why do you have on Ma's ONI?

25:06.880 --> 25:07.881
<i>They arrested us.</i>

25:08.757 --> 25:10.342
Honey, what's that around your neck?

25:10.425 --> 25:12.052
<i>The Governor's man put it on me.</i>

25:12.552 --> 25:15.263
<i>He said all he has to do is blink</i>
<i>and boom.</i>

25:16.473 --> 25:17.724
<i>-Mom--</i>
-You're okay.

25:17.807 --> 25:20.644
<i>I don't want to die again.</i>
<i>I've already lost my sleeve once.</i>

25:20.727 --> 25:22.062
That is not gonna happen.

25:22.562 --> 25:25.232
I am coming to get you.
I am tracking your signal right now.

25:25.315 --> 25:28.401
- <i>I have to go.</i>

25:28.485 --> 25:29.819
<i>-</i>Wait, TJ.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.661
What is that?

25:37.744 --> 25:40.997
Danica Harlan took Myka and TJ.
They're being held here.

25:42.457 --> 25:43.750
Alloy processing facility?

25:43.833 --> 25:46.545
It was marked abandoned
when mining was halted during the war.

25:46.628 --> 25:49.256
There's security.
It's obviously not abandoned.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.425
I'm gonna need some leverage
to even get close.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.261
Ooh! What kind of leverage?

25:57.013 --> 25:59.349
Say the most wanted man on the planet
happened to show up.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.643
-Miss Trepp, you cannot be--
-His DHF is in virtual.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.979
His sleeve is empty.
He's not even using it.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.399
And as you so astutely noted,
Mr. Kovacs is a wanted man.

26:07.482 --> 26:09.609
Swapping sleeves
will only put yourself at risk.

26:09.693 --> 26:10.902
That's the point.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.863
The bounty for him is enough
to open any door.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.448
Miss Trepp, I will not allow--

26:15.532 --> 26:18.118
Poe! My brother is lost!

26:18.868 --> 26:22.455
He may never recover.
I am not about to lose my wife and kid.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.666
And he made me a promise.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.337
I insist you return him in one piece, hmm?

26:41.141 --> 26:42.559
I got it, Poe.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.395
Don't scratch the paint.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.944
You think you're helping her? You're not.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.989
She'll lose and she'll die.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.574
But where does that leave you?

26:58.491 --> 27:00.118
She's the only one who can hold you.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.621
I won't let you stand in the way.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.081
Of what? Murdering the last Founder?

27:05.165 --> 27:07.584
I hear Konrad Harlan
is a tough man to find.

27:08.084 --> 27:09.753
What did they do to you?

27:10.587 --> 27:13.757
It must have been really bad
for you to go through all of this.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.216
You understand nothing.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.427
I know she's in here somewhere.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.805
-I'll find her.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.807
We're not done talking.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.477
Now who's playing tricks?

27:25.560 --> 27:28.146
Controlling a construct isn't a trick,
it's a skill,

27:28.229 --> 27:29.481
one I learned from her.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.233
I've seen what her mind contains.

27:32.525 --> 27:35.528
We made a bargain,
and I will take what I'm owed!

27:41.159 --> 27:42.535
-What's happening?

27:42.619 --> 27:44.496
The code's slipping. You could be exposed.

27:44.579 --> 27:47.707
<i>-I can pull you out now.</i>
-Negative. We're staying in.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.460
Are you sure about that?

27:50.543 --> 27:53.755
You've picked up a bad habit
of questioning my command.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.840
Maybe I should've questioned it sooner,

27:55.924 --> 27:58.218
like when you recruited me
and told me you'd protect Rei?

27:59.719 --> 28:00.679
I helped her.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.391
Seems like we're all better off
without your help.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.143
I made it right.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.063
Made sure she got everything
she never had.

28:10.563 --> 28:13.858
Why do it at all?
He'd already turned his back on you.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.652
You knew he chose Falconer.

28:15.735 --> 28:16.986
Why help Rei?

28:20.448 --> 28:22.033
Because I wanted him back.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.339
Give her to me.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.091
I can't do that.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.430
Maybe you should just give up.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.225
I'm not failing,

28:47.976 --> 28:48.893
I'm learning.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.730
Watch.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.696
You think this primitive playground
gives you power?

28:59.779 --> 29:02.490
I know where she's been,
what she's capable of.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.491
I need her back!

29:03.575 --> 29:05.410
Not until you tell me
what the Founders did.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.259
Why don't you give me the truth?

29:21.342 --> 29:23.261
-What makes you think you could see it?
-Try me.

29:37.066 --> 29:40.737
You wouldn't know the truth if it was
lying on top of you. She understood.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.117
Understood what?

29:46.201 --> 29:47.452
What did they do to you?

29:48.286 --> 29:49.704
Trust me enough to tell me!

29:59.672 --> 30:00.840
I call down fire.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.802
I manipulate the alloy
you seed in your bodies

30:03.885 --> 30:05.970
and rupture your veins from within.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.807
I've been killed before. It didn't take.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.652
-What are you doing?
-You don't fear your own death.

30:20.735 --> 30:21.861
What about hers?

30:25.698 --> 30:27.075
Wait!

30:27.742 --> 30:28.827
Keep going!

30:31.704 --> 30:32.747
Run!

30:36.584 --> 30:39.128
-I'm offline.
-She's going into cardiac arrest.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.423
I will not allow you to die!

30:44.008 --> 30:45.760
Uh, the construct, it's resetting.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.306
-What is it?
-There's some kind of lag in my system.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.975
I'm slowing.

30:52.475 --> 30:53.560
It's okay.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.270
I can push past it.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.525
Where did you get all this?

31:03.403 --> 31:06.865
-I thought our research was destroyed.
- We merely confiscated it.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.868
When your dig sites were closed,
we amassed quite a stockpile.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.245
<i>-</i>My friends died.
-Your friends were a nuisance.

31:12.328 --> 31:14.455
They should never have protested
the mining of alloy.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.750
The Governor thinks this may be of use.

31:20.378 --> 31:24.299
You do realize this isn't the alphabet.
These glyphs, they illustrate concepts.

31:24.382 --> 31:25.550
Context is everything.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.012
-Caught him sneaking around.
- TJ!

31:31.306 --> 31:32.599
Not a careful kid, is he?

31:33.099 --> 31:33.975
Leave him out of this.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.769
Tell us how to control Angelfire
and we will.

31:36.853 --> 31:40.231
Humans aren't capable of using Elder tech.
It's too advanced.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.109
Quellcrist Falconer is human.
There must be a way.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.611
I suggest you find it.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.114
Or do I have to remind you
of the technology that I control?

31:52.076 --> 31:52.952
Don't, I...

31:53.453 --> 31:55.663
-I need time.
-The Governor's on her way.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.624
She's expecting an answer.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.043
Ticktock.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.728
You can't bear the thought of losing her.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.523
You say you want the truth.

32:25.401 --> 32:26.569
Can you see it?

32:28.488 --> 32:29.656
What are you?

32:30.865 --> 32:31.908
These roots...

32:33.201 --> 32:34.327
are a network...

32:35.703 --> 32:38.498
that copy and store complex information.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.209
Like your stacks.

32:43.836 --> 32:45.213
Do you understand?

32:45.964 --> 32:48.341
Your consciousness was in the Songspire.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.177
When the miners broke through, it got out.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.512
You burned right through them.

32:52.595 --> 32:54.347
Your minds and bodies are so fragile.

32:55.431 --> 32:57.100
They can only hold so much.

32:58.559 --> 33:01.020
I'll have to account for that
as I finish my task.

33:03.606 --> 33:04.816
You're not human.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.777
You're an Elder.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.622
We need a hard reset
to finish the mission.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.207
No reset. I'm pulling you out.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.376
-You can't move.
-But you can.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.546
He's just on the other side.

33:28.631 --> 33:31.968
If I stay here, they can finish
the backtrace, locate their server.

33:33.553 --> 33:34.637
I trust you can find them.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.556
The construct is unstable.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.766
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.896
You hate him that much?

33:44.731 --> 33:45.773
I don't hate him.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.986
I've trained thousands of elite soldiers.

33:51.195 --> 33:54.949
He was the only one who truly learned
everything I had to teach.

33:56.659 --> 33:58.494
He became his own man.

34:01.080 --> 34:04.459
He could've been great,
better than me, but...

34:06.878 --> 34:08.046
he wasted it.

34:10.590 --> 34:11.924
You can be different.

34:14.093 --> 34:15.762
You can become who he should've been.

34:18.556 --> 34:19.390
Go.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.225
It's an order.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.232
Pull me out of the construct. Now.

34:35.490 --> 34:37.116
You thought we were gone.

34:38.367 --> 34:39.744
You are not the first.

34:44.999 --> 34:45.875
What is this?

34:45.958 --> 34:49.087
I'm showing you what I showed her.

35:05.394 --> 35:06.729
Are we sure they're alive?

35:10.775 --> 35:11.609
Fuck.

35:12.401 --> 35:13.653
They're definitely alive.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.076
The planet survey
said it was uninhabited.

35:20.159 --> 35:23.371
We scanned for organic life-forms.
Results were negative.

35:24.413 --> 35:26.874
That was a scan of the surface.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.294
The truth often lies beneath the skin.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.421
We trained for first contact, Konrad.

35:32.922 --> 35:35.675
Any sign of alien life
would be put to the Protectorate.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.218
And lose our charter?

35:38.136 --> 35:39.804
Surely you're not suggesting...

35:39.887 --> 35:41.681
I didn't give up half my life traveling

35:41.764 --> 35:43.599
just to pack up
and get on the ship, did you?

35:44.559 --> 35:47.061
-You?
-What you're contemplating,

35:47.436 --> 35:48.396
it's genocide.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.856
This is my world.

35:51.732 --> 35:52.775
No!

36:11.043 --> 36:13.129
This symbol mark's a roost,

36:13.671 --> 36:14.589
a nursery.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.967
Wascynski hypothesized that there were
Elders who functioned as guardians.

36:18.050 --> 36:20.303
They had an empathic connection
to their offspring.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.388
What the fuck does that have to do
with Angelfire?

36:23.973 --> 36:25.308
-It doesn't.
- It doesn't?

36:28.603 --> 36:31.606
I'm afraid you're gonna have to do
better than that.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.616
Hey, this area's off-limits.

36:41.699 --> 36:42.575
Good call.

36:43.409 --> 36:44.785
The Last Envoy.

36:48.122 --> 36:49.207
Damn right, I am.

36:54.378 --> 36:57.965
There's a theory that Songspires
were the basis for all Elder technology,

36:58.090 --> 36:59.425
including the Orbitals.

36:59.508 --> 37:02.762
So it could be that the Elders
had an empathic connection

37:02.845 --> 37:04.263
to activate these artifacts,

37:04.347 --> 37:06.557
but we just don't have the right minds
to make them work.

37:08.559 --> 37:09.936
This is my Archaeologue?

37:10.019 --> 37:11.729
I'm telling you what I know.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.356
They were a militaristic species.

37:13.439 --> 37:16.234
Most of their texts described war.
We just don't know who they're fight--

37:16.317 --> 37:19.195
Stone, she needs to focus.
Clearly the child is a distraction.

37:19.278 --> 37:21.822
If you want to know something
about Angelfire...

37:23.532 --> 37:25.785
why not ask the guy who lived through it?

37:25.868 --> 37:27.536
Takeshi Kovacs.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.622
This is a surprise.

37:30.665 --> 37:31.791
Let them go.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.294
People with guns to their stacks
are in no position to negotiate.

37:37.129 --> 37:42.635
I escaped The Circle and Angelfire.
I'm not <i>people.</i> Now...

37:44.387 --> 37:46.055
why waste your bullets on them...

37:47.390 --> 37:49.058
when you can have the real prize?

37:50.142 --> 37:51.227
Get down.

37:56.691 --> 37:57.775
I'm unarmed.

37:58.401 --> 38:01.737
So why not be smart this time
and prove you're your father's daughter?

38:01.821 --> 38:04.490
You know what Konrad would do?
Stone, show the man.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.834
It won't do anything.
I'll just spin back up.

38:56.917 --> 38:59.670
-Yeah, but it'll still feel good.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.216
That was for the Archaeologues.

39:06.761 --> 39:07.887
TJ.

39:08.387 --> 39:09.263
You're okay.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.141
I told you I was coming to get you.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.438
I don't understand.
How do you know my son?

39:17.521 --> 39:18.731
It's Mom.

39:21.734 --> 39:22.610
Trepp?

39:23.235 --> 39:24.111
Mm-hmm.

39:28.574 --> 39:30.785
-Hello?

39:33.579 --> 39:34.413
Miss Trepp!

39:35.456 --> 39:36.665
Impeccable timing.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.085
Get me out of this thing.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.378
With pleasure.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.838
-Her pulse is weak.
-How much longer?

39:43.756 --> 39:45.007
I'm almost there.

39:52.306 --> 39:53.808
They killed your children.

39:54.683 --> 39:57.520
They planted explosives
and burned it all down.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.688
That's why Quell went after the Founders.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.023
She was helping you.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.192
Now you know why I need her.

40:03.859 --> 40:05.194
Repay my trust.

40:06.445 --> 40:07.822
Give her back.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.825
Your revenge, you deserve it.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.119
Then release her.

40:14.036 --> 40:14.870
I can't.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.290
-You and I may be ghosts, but she's not.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.210
You're no different
than  they are!

40:29.635 --> 40:32.221
They're both crashing, Miss Dig.
We're out of time.

40:32.304 --> 40:35.683
Just... a few... more seconds.

40:41.063 --> 40:44.692
I was wrong to trust you.
All you deserve  is death!

40:46.861 --> 40:48.696
-Mr. Kovacs.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.074
- Quell.
-She's spinning back up. Just breathe.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.868
The firewall.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.619
It is complete. I'll show you.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.247
The construct is resetting.

41:03.085 --> 41:05.713
I'm taking her off ice now.

41:06.797 --> 41:07.756
There she is.

41:08.340 --> 41:10.593
Her DHF data is outside the firewall.

41:11.093 --> 41:13.179
I'm transferring it back into her stack.

41:21.228 --> 41:23.105
-Quell, it's me.

41:24.690 --> 41:25.524
Tak?

41:29.487 --> 41:30.571
What did you do?

41:39.914 --> 41:41.832
<i>The Elder, we got it out of you.</i>

41:41.916 --> 41:45.085
I was containing it.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.129
-No, it was killing you.
-You should've let it.

41:47.963 --> 41:48.964
I made a promise.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.799
My body and vengeance

41:52.009 --> 41:53.427
for her mercy.

41:55.221 --> 41:56.055
Now...

41:57.515 --> 42:00.559
we'll all burn.

42:00.643 --> 42:01.685
The Praetorians.

42:02.436 --> 42:05.397
I'm picking up their signal.
They're heading this way.

42:17.284 --> 42:19.245
-You good with this?
-Always.

42:19.328 --> 42:21.497
How the hell did they even find us?

42:22.164 --> 42:23.707
Don't worry, Miss Dig.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.752
I won't let those blaggards
hurt you again.

42:26.835 --> 42:30.506
You were right.
I should've combed over the files.

42:31.173 --> 42:32.508
I just did a scan.

42:32.591 --> 42:36.220
They put a tag in my system.
They've been shadowing my code.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.266
Oh, dear.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.560
Poe...

42:44.019 --> 42:45.354
you have to power me down.

42:45.896 --> 42:49.441
Surely there is something less extreme.
It isn't your fault.

42:50.025 --> 42:52.319
This is the only way to disable the link.

42:53.195 --> 42:54.488
I led them here.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.617
I won't let them use me to hurt you again.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.205
We'll find each other
when this is all over.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.081
Wait for my mark.

44:58.862 --> 44:59.697
Colonel?

45:01.031 --> 45:02.366
Thank goodness.
