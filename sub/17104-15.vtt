TARA (VOICEOVER): Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:03.560 --> 00:06.799
-Relax, T. I'll get you home
before you're a pumpkin.

00:06.839 --> 00:07.440
Hey, man.

00:07.480 --> 00:08.160
MAN: Hi.

00:08.199 --> 00:09.160
-Uh, Lucas Hewitt.

00:09.199 --> 00:11.119
-Recovery isn't always smooth.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.839
So when were you gonna
ask to go back to dancing?

00:13.880 --> 00:15.599
-I guess you'll tell
me when I'm ready.

00:18.559 --> 00:20.480
-That was perfect.

00:20.519 --> 00:22.079
I knew you could do it.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.640
-You're the little girl
in the training bra.

00:23.679 --> 00:26.440
High-pitched voice, having to
spy on guys in the bathroom.

00:26.480 --> 00:27.280
That's you, right?

00:27.320 --> 00:28.679
Ever even kissed a guy?

00:28.719 --> 00:29.640
You haven't, have you?

00:33.320 --> 00:34.200
-We should get going.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.159
We'll miss curfew.

00:43.840 --> 00:48.479
THEME SONG: Whoa-oh, whoa.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.799
Whoa-oh, whoa.

00:50.840 --> 00:57.320
Take a breath, close your eyes.

00:57.359 --> 01:01.759
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:05.799 --> 01:09.719
This is my chance,
this is my chance.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.719
My chance to feel alive.

01:12.760 --> 01:16.680
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:16.719 --> 01:18.319
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:22.599 --> 01:25.040
TARA (VOICEOVER): I loved my
first pair of pointe shoes

01:25.079 --> 01:28.799
so much I took them
to bed with me.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.799
Before my first class, I spent
hours carefully preparing

01:31.840 --> 01:34.599
my feet and the shoes.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.200
But nothing could've
prepared me for how much it

01:37.239 --> 01:39.359
hurt to dance on pointe.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.599
It's like the most intense pain.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.560
Blisters, blood.

01:44.599 --> 01:46.280
Totally inhumane.

01:46.319 --> 01:50.400
And then one day,
you get used to it.

01:50.439 --> 01:52.760
-I know you can't have
forgotten how vastly superior

01:52.799 --> 01:54.480
I am to you.

01:54.519 --> 01:55.480
Who's better?

01:55.519 --> 01:56.799
Me or Christian?

01:56.840 --> 01:57.799
-You.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.239
-Aw.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.480
TARA (VOICEOVER): Which
just goes to show,

02:02.519 --> 02:04.719
you can talk yourself
into anything.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.280
-Genius.

02:18.319 --> 02:19.800
Pure, unadulterated, let me die
right now because I will never

02:19.840 --> 02:22.280
be this happy ever
again geniosity.

02:22.319 --> 02:24.319
-I saw them last
year in the States.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.199
I think they played better then.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.800
-That is so pretentious!

02:27.840 --> 02:30.800
You can't tell me magic didn't
just happen here tonight!

02:30.840 --> 02:32.319
-They weren't bad.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.759
-Not bad?

02:34.800 --> 02:36.280
Better than not bad.

02:36.319 --> 02:37.840
Say it.

02:37.879 --> 02:40.280
No, I am not kissing
you again until you

02:40.319 --> 02:42.719
admit that was the most
amazing music ever played

02:42.759 --> 02:43.840
in the entire world.

02:43.879 --> 02:44.639
-Entire universe.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.199
MISS RAINE: Katrina!

03:02.240 --> 03:03.599
Please don't let us disturb you.

03:07.560 --> 03:08.199
Katrina!

03:13.759 --> 03:15.599
This is well outside curfew.

03:15.639 --> 03:18.080
And don't think it didn't
escape my attention that you

03:18.120 --> 03:19.639
skipped afternoon classes today.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.759
-It was just Jazz.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.159
I thought you'd
approve, Miss Raine.

03:22.199 --> 03:23.639
-The day is getting
close when you'll

03:23.680 --> 03:28.599
discover that the joke is
increasingly on you, Katrina.

03:28.639 --> 03:30.400
This is Petra Hoffman.

03:30.439 --> 03:32.759
On exchange from the
Berlin Ballet School.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.319
Your new roommate.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.680
Petra, ignore everything
Katrina tells you.

03:37.719 --> 03:41.400
Welcome to the National Academy.

03:41.439 --> 03:42.400
-Standard issue.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.680
Teachers in Germany
are the same.

03:44.719 --> 03:46.199
-Oh.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.520
Well Petra Hoffman, welcome
to Chateau Karamakov.

03:55.240 --> 03:58.280
Just throw the clothes
off that bed, it's yours.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.599
You can take them down
if you really hate them.

04:10.639 --> 04:14.280
-You can tell everything
about someone by their feet.

04:14.319 --> 04:17.720
How they stand in the
world, how grounded

04:17.759 --> 04:19.639
they are, how they dance.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.319
I think they're beautiful.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.360
-[laughs] They're just snaps.

04:27.399 --> 04:29.360
-I collect love.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.720
I mean, more like signs of love.

04:31.759 --> 04:33.519
Public displays of affection.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.560
-Sweet.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.639
Well, you'll have
to give me a copy

04:35.680 --> 04:37.480
of the photo you took before.

04:37.519 --> 04:38.839
My boyfriend'll love it.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.279
-So that was your boyfriend?

04:57.519 --> 04:59.600
-So was it worth it?

04:59.639 --> 05:01.360
-Let me think.

05:01.399 --> 05:03.480
15 awesome bands
and the opportunity

05:03.519 --> 05:05.120
to spend it with
thousands of people

05:05.160 --> 05:08.480
who didn't talk about
ballet once the entire day.

05:08.519 --> 05:09.560
Yes, it was worth it.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.639
-Really?

05:10.680 --> 05:11.639
Miss Raine trapped
me after Jazz.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.759
She knows you skipped.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.279
KAT: Yeah, I spoke
to her already.

05:14.319 --> 05:17.160
You know, she watched Lucas and
I kissing for a very long time

05:17.199 --> 05:18.160
before she interrupted.

05:18.199 --> 05:19.360
Don't you think that's weird?

05:19.399 --> 05:21.040
-She did the same
with me and Isabelle.

05:21.079 --> 05:22.600
It was kinda creepy.

05:22.639 --> 05:24.759
-Sitting right here.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.240
-Sorry.

05:26.279 --> 05:27.639
It was a long time ago and
I can barely remember it.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.639
-Good.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.600
KAT: Yuck.

05:29.639 --> 05:32.519
Blech.

05:32.560 --> 05:33.519
-Oh, sorry.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.319
-Uh, Petra Hoffman,
German exchange.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.360
Tara Webster and
Ethan, my brother.

05:38.399 --> 05:39.120
PETRA: Hi.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.160
KAT: They're love birds.

05:40.199 --> 05:41.480
-What's with the photo?

05:41.519 --> 05:42.560
-Oh.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.600
If you don't like
it, please erase it.

05:43.639 --> 05:46.600
KAT: Petra's into PDAs.

05:46.639 --> 05:47.560
-Which are?

05:47.600 --> 05:48.560
KAT: Your favorite thing.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.839
Public displays of affection.

05:49.879 --> 05:51.160
-Just the photos.

05:51.199 --> 05:52.600
-I actually really like it.

05:52.639 --> 05:55.680
-Now that you're the pash
expert and everything.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.079
-Katrina, my office now!

06:01.839 --> 06:02.480
-Great.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.199
-You're on shaky
ground, Katrina.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.680
If I hadn't known you so long--

06:08.720 --> 06:10.720
-Don't treat me any differently
because you know my family.

06:10.759 --> 06:13.399
-I was going to say that I
know you well enough to realize

06:13.439 --> 06:17.360
that detention won't
change your behavior.

06:17.399 --> 06:20.360
One of our ex-students,
Gus Walker,

06:20.399 --> 06:22.399
is doing some interesting
community work.

06:22.439 --> 06:25.160
You'll be spending this
afternoon, and the next four

06:25.199 --> 06:28.639
Saturday afternoons,
helping him out.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.319
-Couldn't I just clean out
the shoe lockers instead?

06:48.519 --> 06:51.399
-You do know this is
just barre, right?

06:51.439 --> 06:53.639
-Hi, I'm Petra.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.800
-You don't have to wear
pointe shoes during warm up.

06:55.839 --> 06:58.800
-It's how we'll dance when
we're professionals, so why not

06:58.839 --> 07:00.360
always do it this way?

07:06.160 --> 07:10.800
TARA: Your roommate is
taking Abigail's spot.

07:10.839 --> 07:13.319
-[laughs] Blood sport!

07:13.360 --> 07:16.439
I like it.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.720
-Watch those hips in
the devant, Abigail.

07:28.759 --> 07:30.560
Don't lose your line.

07:34.399 --> 07:35.399
Lovely, Petra.

07:35.439 --> 07:37.480
Good work.

07:37.519 --> 07:39.480
Stretch it out and
come into the center.

07:39.519 --> 07:40.120
Abigail.

07:44.279 --> 07:45.759
I spoke with Dr.
Wicks this morning.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.639
She thinks you should restrict
yourself to the barre for now.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.040
-But I'm fine.

07:50.079 --> 07:51.079
-You're still getting
your strength back.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.399
Sit this one out.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.079
[piano playing]

08:20.519 --> 08:22.240
-Take note, girls.

08:22.279 --> 08:24.680
Look at Petra's lines.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.439
Nothing is broken.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.800
It appears effortless.

08:28.839 --> 08:29.759
Lovely.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.600
Lovely training.

08:36.399 --> 08:38.360
-Petra has the most
incredible extensions.

08:38.399 --> 08:40.639
Don't you think
she's incredible?

08:40.679 --> 08:42.240
-Incredible.

08:42.279 --> 08:45.039
-You know, she actually made
me remember why I'm here.

08:45.080 --> 08:45.799
-Hey!

08:45.840 --> 08:47.720
You're not busy, are you?

08:47.759 --> 08:49.279
-Not anymore.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.399
-I'm thinking about my show
reel and I need a dancer.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.039
Do you know any?

08:53.080 --> 08:54.200
-[gagging]

08:54.240 --> 08:55.320
TARA: I might do.

09:02.519 --> 09:04.200
-You remember that
piece that Isabelle

09:04.240 --> 09:06.399
did for my
contemporary showcase?

09:06.440 --> 09:07.879
-Wait.

09:07.919 --> 09:09.399
Are you only using me because
Isabelle's away on exchange?

09:09.440 --> 09:11.480
-Is she?

09:11.519 --> 09:13.399
I'm using you 'cause
you're perfect.

09:13.440 --> 09:13.879
-Really?

09:13.919 --> 09:14.480
ETHAN: Yes.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.759
-I'll come back later.

09:19.799 --> 09:20.799
-Hey, no, no, no.

09:20.840 --> 09:21.799
Come on in.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.799
You remember the chorey, right?

09:23.840 --> 09:25.679
-It was a while ago.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.320
-Maybe you should
get someone else.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.039
-No, wait.

09:28.080 --> 09:28.759
I remember it.

09:28.799 --> 09:29.600
-Well, good.

09:29.639 --> 09:31.159
You're both cast.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.200
My gorgeous, sweet Juliet and
difficult, brooding Romeo.

09:34.240 --> 09:34.559
Perfect.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.200
-No loud noises, no
sudden movements.

10:28.240 --> 10:28.799
Hey!

10:28.840 --> 10:30.320
-Mm, vintage, huh?

10:30.360 --> 10:32.080
I wonder how much these
would be at the pawn shop?

10:32.120 --> 10:34.080
-Give them back or
I'll crunch your bones.

10:34.120 --> 10:34.799
-You can't touch me.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.159
-Don't try me.

Bad things happen
to bad little boys.

-You must be Kat.

10:41.519 --> 10:46.559
So Scout, you gonna give
Kat her sunnies back?

-OK, you were better
than I expected.

11:40.679 --> 11:42.639
-Better than anyone at
your fancy ballet school?

11:42.679 --> 11:45.039
-What makes you think I go
to a fancy ballet school?

11:45.080 --> 11:47.759
-You can tell by looking at you.

11:47.799 --> 11:50.080
And Gus told us
before you got here.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.559
-Scout's been nagging
me all morning

11:51.600 --> 11:53.840
to get you to teach them some--
what do you call it, Scout?

11:53.879 --> 11:55.320
-Proper girl's ballet.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.320
I'm very busy.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.399
You have to leave me alone.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.720
Go home!

12:59.759 --> 13:04.039
[dog whining]

13:04.080 --> 13:05.480
-OK, OK.

13:05.519 --> 13:08.559
So what do you know about
public displays of affection?

13:08.600 --> 13:10.519
[dog whining]

13:14.679 --> 13:17.679
-My brother used to say that our
old dog Ziggy could read minds.

13:20.679 --> 13:22.159
[knocking at door]

13:22.200 --> 13:23.600
SAMMY: Hello?

13:23.639 --> 13:24.519
[dog whining]

13:24.559 --> 13:25.159
-Shh.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.399
SAMMY: Hello?

13:27.440 --> 13:28.240
-Be very quiet.

13:28.279 --> 13:31.799
SAMMY: Is anyone there?

13:31.840 --> 13:32.399
-Shh!

13:37.519 --> 13:39.080
-Thought so.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.519
Saturday afternoons
everyone tends

13:40.559 --> 13:42.799
to get out of here, which
isn't so great if you've just

13:42.840 --> 13:44.320
arrived, right?

13:44.360 --> 13:45.759
Sorry, I'm, I'm Sammy Lieberman.

13:45.799 --> 13:46.759
I'm Kat's friend.

13:46.799 --> 13:47.639
-Hi.

13:47.679 --> 13:48.600
-You're the new girl.

13:48.639 --> 13:50.480
Obviously.

13:50.519 --> 13:51.399
Uh, cake?

13:51.440 --> 13:52.600
-Why not?

13:52.639 --> 13:54.679
--[chuckles] My uh, my
grandmother bakes it.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.639
Chocolate each week.

13:55.679 --> 13:56.759
I usually give mine to Kat.

13:56.799 --> 13:57.799
The girl is a cake--

13:57.840 --> 13:59.480
PETRA: She seems fun.

13:59.519 --> 14:02.240
-[sneezes] Ugh, fiend.

14:02.279 --> 14:02.600
Ugh.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.840
Ugh!

14:06.879 --> 14:09.320
[sniffs] Sorry, I'm not,
I'm not usually like this.

14:09.360 --> 14:14.679
It's just around cats and pollen
and [sneezes and blows nose]

14:14.720 --> 14:17.159
uh, dogs.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.639
Which doesn't make any sense.

14:18.679 --> 14:19.600
-Right.

14:19.639 --> 14:21.159
-Uh, this could get ugly.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.759
I should, should
probably get going.

14:24.799 --> 14:25.639
[sneezes] Oh!

14:28.879 --> 14:32.799
[dog barking]

14:32.840 --> 14:35.600
-You're scaring
away the cute boys!

14:35.639 --> 14:37.600
[whining]

14:37.639 --> 14:38.600
-Cake?

14:38.639 --> 14:39.600
[barks]

14:39.639 --> 14:40.559
-Second position.

14:43.360 --> 14:47.639
Tendu and lower,
tendu and close.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.120
Good!

14:49.159 --> 14:50.080
Couple more lessons and
we'll make ballet bots out

14:50.120 --> 14:50.639
of the lot of you.

14:50.679 --> 14:51.639
GUS: OK, guys.

14:51.679 --> 14:52.600
I'll catch you next week, hey?

14:52.639 --> 14:53.679
Come pack up.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.639
-Is that what you are?

14:54.679 --> 14:55.639
KAT: Hardly.

14:55.679 --> 14:57.720
SCOUT: Then what are you?

14:57.759 --> 14:58.480
-Good question.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.559
-I bet you're not as good as
the guys on "Dance Explosion."

15:04.600 --> 15:05.840
-That lame TV show?

15:05.879 --> 15:06.639
-As if!

15:06.679 --> 15:08.159
They're amazing!

15:08.200 --> 15:09.279
-They're all right.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.600
You can see for
yourself if you want.

15:10.639 --> 15:11.440
I can make a call.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.720
-Really?

15:12.759 --> 15:13.679
-Yeah, the producer's an
old friend of the family.

15:13.720 --> 15:14.679
-Don't get their hopes up.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.320
A lot of these kids do it tough.

15:16.360 --> 15:16.840
-No, really.

15:16.879 --> 15:17.440
It's, it's fine.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.240
Liz, it's Kat.

15:23.279 --> 15:26.159
Yeah look, I've got a
bunch of dance freaks

15:26.200 --> 15:29.600
that would kill to come to
a taping if you've got room?

15:29.639 --> 15:30.720
Tomorrow?

15:30.759 --> 15:31.639
Amazing!

15:31.679 --> 15:33.279
I owe you one, thank you.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.480
Uh, how does tomorrow
10 o'clock sound?

15:35.519 --> 15:36.759
[cheers]

15:36.799 --> 15:38.360
GUS: OK guys, I'll
get the bus, but I'll

15:38.399 --> 15:39.720
need you all to get permission.

15:39.759 --> 15:41.399
That means signatures.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.399
[music playing]

16:03.720 --> 16:04.600
-Careful!

16:04.639 --> 16:05.720
-You were fine!

16:05.759 --> 16:07.360
-I was about to fall
flat on my face!

16:07.399 --> 16:08.799
-When have I ever dropped you?

16:08.840 --> 16:10.320
-All right!

16:10.360 --> 16:12.039
Thought you guys were getting
along better these days?

16:12.080 --> 16:14.039
-It's got nothing
to do with that.

16:14.080 --> 16:14.840
-You know what?

16:14.879 --> 16:16.159
I've got enough stuff, so--

16:16.200 --> 16:17.440
-But we haven't done
a full take yet.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.720
-Yeah well, I'll
just use what I got.

16:19.759 --> 16:21.159
Thanks for your help.

16:24.840 --> 16:25.600
-Me too?

16:37.639 --> 16:39.320
So I, I'll just, I'll just go.

16:54.159 --> 16:55.679
-Hey, how was your
love bird afternoon?

16:55.720 --> 16:56.799
-Rudely interrupted.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.799
How was your enforced slavery?

16:58.840 --> 17:00.519
-Surprisingly enjoyable.

17:00.559 --> 17:02.440
-I thought you hated kids?

17:02.480 --> 17:05.799
-Shows how little
you know about me.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.160
Uh, who stole my sheets?

17:08.200 --> 17:10.598
[dog barks]

17:10.640 --> 17:11.640
TARA: Oh, um.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.519
-Dog?

17:12.559 --> 17:14.759
-Oh no!

17:14.799 --> 17:15.759
She was lost.

17:15.799 --> 17:18.039
I couldn't leave her alone.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.118
KAT: You're a rule breaker!

17:20.160 --> 17:20.799
-I'm really not.

17:20.839 --> 17:21.559
[dog growling]

17:21.598 --> 17:22.799
-Shh.

17:22.839 --> 17:23.598
Petra, you've just gone
up a notch in my books.

17:23.640 --> 17:24.559
Don't fight it.

17:24.598 --> 17:26.440
[growling]

17:26.480 --> 17:29.319
-You, on the other hand!

17:29.359 --> 17:30.599
You cannot keep a dog here.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.680
We have to find his family.

17:38.799 --> 17:39.759
PETRA: Ziggy!

17:46.440 --> 17:47.759
[laughing]

17:47.799 --> 17:48.759
-OK, OK, OK!

18:41.680 --> 18:43.640
MISS RAINE: Tara, keep up!

18:57.680 --> 18:58.799
SAMMY: [sneezes]

18:58.839 --> 19:00.480
KAT: Are you allergic
to everything?

19:00.519 --> 19:02.839
SAMMY: [sneezes] Yeah.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.480
OK, bad idea.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.599
I'll see you later.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.680
-Bye.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.319
-I didn't know you liked dogs.

19:09.359 --> 19:10.519
-They're loyal.

19:10.559 --> 19:11.319
And mute.

19:11.359 --> 19:11.839
-[laughs].

19:11.880 --> 19:12.599
ABIGAIL: Here.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.799
He's hungry.

19:13.839 --> 19:15.599
-Oh, so I'm going
to ask if they've

19:15.640 --> 19:17.559
got any spare sausage left over.

19:17.599 --> 19:18.680
[phone ringing]

19:18.720 --> 19:21.240
-Oh, no doubt another
psycho calling.

19:21.279 --> 19:22.680
I still don't
understand why it had

19:22.720 --> 19:24.160
to be my number on the flyer.

19:26.720 --> 19:27.720
-Nice dog.

19:27.759 --> 19:28.720
-He's a stray.

19:28.759 --> 19:29.599
We're looking for his family.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.200
Did you want something?

19:36.240 --> 19:38.799
-Oh, I was, I was just thinking.

19:38.839 --> 19:40.039
We don't talk anymore.

19:40.079 --> 19:40.640
-We never talk.

19:44.519 --> 19:46.279
I'm busy, Christian.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.680
-Right, you're blowing
me off already.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.400
I thought we were meant to
be getting along nowadays?

19:49.440 --> 19:51.079
-Do you have to work
at being annoying

19:51.119 --> 19:53.200
or is it just a natural talent?

19:53.240 --> 19:55.119
-OK, so not another psycho.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.319
Rather the legitimate
owners of Lady Curlington.

19:57.359 --> 20:00.200
They're coming for
her right away.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.599
Who would call a dog that?

20:02.640 --> 20:05.279
Um, where is she?

20:09.880 --> 20:11.680
Guys, where's the dog?

20:15.279 --> 20:19.039
-Um.

20:19.079 --> 20:19.839
-Ziggy!

20:19.880 --> 20:21.480
-Ziggy!

20:21.519 --> 20:23.240
[phone ringing]

20:23.279 --> 20:23.599
-Hi.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.680
Oh.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.480
Right.

20:28.519 --> 20:29.119
Yes, all right.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.160
I completely spaced.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.680
Just-- oh, I'm on my way.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.799
Sorry, Petra!

20:34.839 --> 20:36.160
TARA: And the smirk.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.640
That's really annoying.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.119
-I smirk?

20:39.160 --> 20:40.119
-And your mole.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.079
What is that meant to be anyway?

20:41.119 --> 20:43.319
It just, it just sits there.

20:43.359 --> 20:45.359
-Well, I don't think I can
change that one, sorry.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.599
--[sighs] And you've always
got an answer for everything,

20:47.640 --> 20:48.640
even if it's just your--

20:48.680 --> 20:49.400
-Smirk?

20:49.440 --> 20:51.160
-Yeah, exactly.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.599
[dog barks]

20:52.640 --> 20:55.559
[growling]

20:55.599 --> 20:58.599
-I'll get him.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.559
Come here, boy.

20:59.599 --> 21:00.680
Come here.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.799
-It's a girl.

21:01.839 --> 21:03.799
CHRISTIAN: Here, here girl.

21:03.839 --> 21:04.720
Come here, Ziggy.

21:04.759 --> 21:05.599
Come here.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.319
TARA: Come on, grab her!

21:08.359 --> 21:10.799
-Ugh!

21:10.839 --> 21:12.240
Ziggy!

21:12.279 --> 21:12.880
Oy!

21:12.920 --> 21:13.640
No, don't go there!

21:13.680 --> 21:15.480
Do not go there!

21:15.519 --> 21:16.480
Ziggy, come here.

21:19.599 --> 21:20.359
Ziggy!

21:20.400 --> 21:22.319
[whistles] Oy!

21:22.359 --> 21:22.680
-Ziggy!

21:28.240 --> 21:29.599
CHRISTIAN: Come here, boy!

21:29.640 --> 21:30.480
Girl, sorry.

21:30.519 --> 21:31.480
TARA: Come on, girl!

21:31.519 --> 21:32.240
[barks]

21:32.279 --> 21:32.720
CHRISTIAN: Come here.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.480
Oy!

21:33.519 --> 21:34.240
TARA: Come here!

21:34.279 --> 21:34.839
CHRISTIAN: Here Ziggy!

21:34.880 --> 21:35.599
Ziggy, Ziggy!

21:35.640 --> 21:36.240
-Come on!

21:36.279 --> 21:37.119
-Ziggy!

21:37.160 --> 21:37.720
-Come here, dog.

21:37.759 --> 21:38.720
-No.

21:38.759 --> 21:39.359
Ready?

21:39.400 --> 21:41.359
And now!

21:41.400 --> 21:41.720
Ugh!

21:50.359 --> 21:53.680
PETRA: Ziggy!

21:53.720 --> 21:55.640
Ziggy!

21:55.680 --> 21:59.039
Aw, I just missed you so much.

21:59.079 --> 22:00.480
Come over here.

22:00.519 --> 22:01.359
Oh good.

22:01.400 --> 22:01.720
Aw.

22:21.119 --> 22:22.440
-Guys, great you're still here.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.640
We better get going.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.640
-It's too late.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.200
I've had to send the bus away.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.359
-Well, can't you
just get it back?

22:28.400 --> 22:29.480
I'm so sorry.

22:29.519 --> 22:30.599
There was this dog
called Lady Curlington,

22:30.640 --> 22:31.799
but we called her Ziggy.

22:31.839 --> 22:32.799
And she went missing
and we tried to find her

22:32.839 --> 22:33.799
and we just couldn't find her.

22:33.839 --> 22:35.799
It was total chaos.

22:35.839 --> 22:38.039
-You promised.

22:38.079 --> 22:40.279
GUS: I'll call the Academy.

22:40.319 --> 22:42.480
They can find you
another punishment.

22:42.519 --> 22:45.440
I can't risk these kids with
someone they can't trust.

22:56.480 --> 22:59.160
TARA (VOICEOVER): The first
time I went on pointe, I

22:59.200 --> 23:01.680
didn't realize how much
I'd cheated my technique.

23:09.599 --> 23:11.400
You can hide things in flats.

23:11.440 --> 23:15.200
But when your entire body
weight is resting on two toes,

23:15.240 --> 23:17.319
there's no room for faking it.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.400
-Hey!

23:24.440 --> 23:25.359
Where'd you go?

23:25.400 --> 23:26.640
-Don't ask.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.720
TARA (VOICEOVER): Your
weaknesses are on display.

23:28.759 --> 23:30.279
