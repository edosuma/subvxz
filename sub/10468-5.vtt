WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.568
I KNOW THAT THEY
WERE HAVING PROBLEMS,

00:03.568 --> 00:05.744
BUT TO DO IT
OVER THE PHONE...

00:05.744 --> 00:07.659
IT SEEMS KIND OF COLD.

00:07.659 --> 00:09.487
HEY, YOU MIND
IF I GRAB ONE
OF THESE MUFFINS?

00:09.487 --> 00:11.098
EVERYTHING IN MY
REFRIGERATOR AT
HOME TASTES LIKE BEER.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.664
GO FOR IT.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.144
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF
WE SHOULD JUDGE HER, CLAUD.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.276
JUDGE WHO?

00:15.276 --> 00:17.365
SARAH'S STAYING
IN NEW YORK.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.323
WHAT, FOR HOW LONG?
COUPLE MORE WEEKS?

00:19.323 --> 00:21.934
INDEFINITELY.
I MEAN, SHE MIGHT
NOT BE COMING HOME.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.197
SO THAT'S IT,
SHE'S JUST GONE?

00:23.197 --> 00:26.504
HEY, BLUEBERRY MUFFINS.
ANYBODY MIND?

00:26.504 --> 00:28.724
MY PARENTS CHARGE ME
FOR BREAKFAST NOW.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.421
SOMEBODY SAY SOMEBODY'S GONE?
WHO'S GONE?

00:30.421 --> 00:32.684
SARAH'S STAYING IN NEW YORK.
SHE'S NOT COMING BACK.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.904
WHAT? YOU MEAN
LIKE PERMANENTLY?

00:34.904 --> 00:36.427
COULD BE.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.690
OH, MAN.
IS BAILEY FREAKING?

00:38.690 --> 00:40.344
EH, HARD TO TELL.

00:40.344 --> 00:43.608
HE'S BEEN UP IN HIS ROOM
EVER SINCE HE TOLD US...

00:43.608 --> 00:46.263
PACKING SARAH'S STUFF.YEESH.

00:46.263 --> 00:50.050
WELL, UH...SOMEONE SHOULD
PROBABLY GO TALK TO HIM, RIGHT?

00:50.050 --> 00:52.182
AND SAY WHAT, WILL?

00:55.881 --> 00:57.100
MORNIN'.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.015
HEY, BUDDY.
HEY, BAY.BAILEY.

01:03.454 --> 01:07.632
OK. LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
EVERYBODY'S THINKING...

01:07.632 --> 01:11.549
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WE
BROKE UP OR ANYTHING, OK.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.508
SARAH'S JUST HANGING IN
NEW YORK FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

01:13.508 --> 01:16.598
AND SO, WE'RE GONNA DO
THE LONG DISTANCE THING.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.556
NO PROBLEM.
GREAT.
YEAH.
SURE.

01:18.556 --> 01:21.255
I MEAN, YEAH, IT'S
GONNA TAKE SOME WORK.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.604
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE'S GONE FOREVER.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.475
AND IN THE MEANTIME,
I GET TO GO TO NEW YORK,

01:24.475 --> 01:25.737
HANG OUT WITH HER THERE,

01:25.737 --> 01:27.217
AND SHE'S GONNA
BE COMING BACK HERE.

01:27.217 --> 01:30.133
SO REALLY,
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.094
IT ISN'T.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.922

NO.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.178
GOOD MORNING.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.571
BACON?

02:16.571 --> 02:19.095
IT'S PART OF YOUR
BRAND NEW REGIMEN.

02:19.095 --> 02:20.531
TO BUILD UP YOUR
SPERM MOTILITY.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.620
GET THOSE SWIMMERS
MOVING FASTER.

02:22.620 --> 02:23.926
MY SPERM?

02:25.101 --> 02:26.929
I'M ALREADY
WORKING ON THAT.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.801
I GAVE UP BEER, I'M
WEARING BAGGIER PANTS.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.673
AND THAT'S GREAT. BUT
THERE'S MORE YOU CAN DO.

02:31.673 --> 02:34.328
LIKE EXTRA CAFFEINE,
VITAMINS, DIET...

02:36.330 --> 02:37.679
FROZEN BOXERS.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.898
HELLO...

02:39.898 --> 02:41.596
DR. VASQUEZ SAID
TO DO ALL THIS?

02:41.596 --> 02:42.684
NO, THE INTERNET DID.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.642
KIRSTEN, THE INTERNET?

02:44.642 --> 02:45.774
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

02:45.774 --> 02:48.385
THESE STUPID
HORMONE INJECTIONS.

02:48.385 --> 02:51.475
SO I LOGGED ON AND I FOUND
A BUNCH OF FERTILITY SITES.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.129
OK, BUT--

02:53.129 --> 02:56.698
LISTEN. IF OUR INSURANCE COVERED
IN VITRO FERTILIZATION,

02:56.698 --> 02:59.614
AND YOU HADN'T
ALREADY TAKEN THAT 2nd JOB
TO PAY FOR ALL THIS,

02:59.614 --> 03:02.965
AND I DIDN'T NEED THESE
STUPID SHOTS TWICE A DAY,

03:02.965 --> 03:07.143
BELIEVE ME, YOU'D BE
GUZZLING BEERS IN YOUR
TIGHTS FOR ALL I CARE.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.841
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS
COUNT. EVERY TRY WE TAKE.

03:09.841 --> 03:16.674
ALL RIGHT. SO CAFFEINE,
THIS FUNKY BACON--

03:16.674 --> 03:18.720
IT'S ACTUALLY
DRIED SNAKE PENIS.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.809
THE CHINESE USE IT
FOR VIRILITY.

03:22.506 --> 03:23.725
WHAT?

03:23.725 --> 03:26.423
THEY HAVE A BILLION
PEOPLE IN CHINA.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.772
WHERE DID YOU
FIND THIS WEBSITE--

03:27.772 --> 03:30.253
WAIT, YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD THE BEST PART.

03:30.253 --> 03:33.865
SEX TWICE A DAY.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.650
REALLY? THEY SAID THAT?

03:35.650 --> 03:37.956
KEEPS THE PIPES
CLEAR.

03:39.697 --> 03:41.656
SHOULD WE TICK ONE OFF
THE LIST RIGHT NOW.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.528
UH....YEAH,

03:44.528 --> 03:47.052
AS SOON AS
I GET MY SHOT...

03:49.707 --> 03:52.884
AND YOU TAKE A COLD SHOWER
AND FINISH YOUR PENIS.

04:04.809 --> 04:09.684
I'M SORRY. THIS IS
JUST TOO--VERY CREEPY.

04:09.684 --> 04:13.383
THESE GUYS? THEY
ONLY SEEM LIKE
THEY'RE WATCHING.

04:13.383 --> 04:16.865
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE
FROGS. I'M TALKING ABOUT US.

04:16.865 --> 04:19.520
ALL THIS HIDING
AND SNEAKING AROUND.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.871
I BROKE UP WITH
ALEXA. I'M NOT GOING
BEHIND HER BACK.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.873
NO, I AM.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.396
ALEXA'S MY FRIEND.

04:26.396 --> 04:30.966
OK. THEN THE WAY I SEE
IT, YOU HAVE 3 CHOICES.

04:32.533 --> 04:35.666
NUMBER ONE IS, WE STOP
SEEING EACH OTHER.

04:35.666 --> 04:40.410
REALLY? I MEAN,
WHAT'S CHOICE NUMBER 2?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.194
NUMBER 2 IS, I TELL HER.

04:42.194 --> 04:44.458
NO. OH, NO. NOT THAT.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.851
SHE'D HATE US
BOTH, CAMERON.

04:46.851 --> 04:50.855
OK. SO WE'RE BACK
TO OPTION 3.

04:50.855 --> 04:54.729
WHICH IS THIS.
FLYING UNDER THE RADAR.

04:54.729 --> 04:57.775
THERE MUST BE 50 GUYS
ASKING HER OUT BY NOW.

04:58.689 --> 05:01.344
REALLY? YOU THINK SO?

05:01.344 --> 05:04.608
I KNOW SO. I USED
TO BE ONE OF THEM.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.829
I'LL SEE YOU 5th PERIOD?

05:15.271 --> 05:17.317
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.536
SO CHECK-IN'S AT 7:00...MM-HMM.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.625
AND MY CONTACT AT THE
BOOKSELLER'S CONFERENCE

05:21.625 --> 05:24.062
PROMISED UP PRIME SPOTS
ON EVERY PANEL.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.499
OH, JULIA. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

05:25.499 --> 05:27.892
UH, CHAPTER 7
HOT OF THE PRESSES.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.459
OH. WELL, YOU COULD
HAVE FAXED IT TO ME

05:29.459 --> 05:31.156
OR GIVEN IT TO
ME TONIGHT AT
THE CONFERENCE.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.941
YEAH. WELL, YOU KNOW, I WAS
JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

05:32.941 --> 05:33.985
HEY, YOU SHAVED.

05:33.985 --> 05:37.075
OH, YEAH.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.861

DIDI CHEN, SHE'S MY
MARKETING DIRECTOR.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.689
DIDI, THIS IS
JULIA SALINGER.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.125
HI.
Didi: NICE
TO MEET YOU.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.171
WAS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE?

05:46.171 --> 05:47.695
HOW'S YOUR HAND?

05:47.695 --> 05:51.351
OH. UH, IT'S GOOD.
I CAN--

05:51.351 --> 05:55.355
UH, THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY
WHAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT.

05:57.705 --> 06:00.447
OH. GOT IT.
WRITER TALK.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.187
PAGE ME.
OK.

06:02.187 --> 06:03.363
WHAT'S UP?

06:06.844 --> 06:08.585
OK. IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.326
I JUST WANNA MAKE
SURE WE'RE OK.

06:10.326 --> 06:11.806
HMM?
UM...

06:11.806 --> 06:14.591
THE OTHER NIGHT AT
THE HOSPITAL WHEN WE--

06:14.591 --> 06:16.245
WHEN I KISSED YOU.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.073
OH, THAT.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.641
THAT'S ANCIENT HISTORY. I
HAVEN'T GIVEN IT A 2nd THOUGHT.

06:20.641 --> 06:21.816
OH...

06:21.816 --> 06:23.731
SO HOW DID THIS
CHAPTER TURN OUT?

06:23.731 --> 06:26.429
I KNOW YOU WENT
BACK AND FORTH ON THAT
FIGHT WITH YOUR BROTHERS.

06:26.429 --> 06:27.952
NOT EVEN A 2nd
THOUGHT, HUH?

06:27.952 --> 06:30.128
WHAT?

06:30.128 --> 06:32.696
I MEAN, I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT
UPSET ABOUT IT.

06:32.696 --> 06:36.265
BUT I GUESS I THOUGHT--
WELL, THE REASON THAT
IT HAPPENED WAS BECAUSE

06:36.265 --> 06:37.875
THERE WAS SOMETHING
BETWEEN US, YOU KNOW.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.355
JULIA...

06:39.355 --> 06:41.313
I MEAN, WE SPEND
MILLIONS OF HOURS
TOGETHER.

06:41.313 --> 06:43.446
AND SHARED ALL KINDS
OF STORIES ABOUT EACH
OTHER'S LIVES...

06:43.446 --> 06:45.753
AND YOU DID KISS ME BACK...LISTEN, YOU'RE NOT--

06:45.753 --> 06:47.885
I MEAN, IF I'M WRONG, IF I'M WAY
OFF BASE--

06:47.885 --> 06:52.629
OK, I'M GONNA STOP YOU.
YOU KNOW, I'M YOUR EDITOR HERE.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.719
YEAH, I KNOW.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.068
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE BOOK.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.461
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

06:58.461 --> 07:03.118
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT
THE SITUATION.

07:03.118 --> 07:05.816
NOW I CAN EITHER
PUBLISH YOU OR NOT.

07:05.816 --> 07:08.602
I'VE GOT ALL
THE POWER BETWEEN US.

07:08.602 --> 07:11.953
WHICH WHEN 2 PEOPLE
WORK TOGETHER AND
THEY ARE NOT EQUALS--

07:11.953 --> 07:16.348
THIS KIND OF THING THAT
YOU'RE ALLUDING TO...

07:16.348 --> 07:17.567
IT'S AGAINST ALL THE RULES.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.179
NOW YOU DO UNDERSTAND
THAT, DON'T YOU?

07:21.179 --> 07:22.616
SURE.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.446
YOU STILL DIDN'T
ANSWER MY QUESTION.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.925
YES, I DID.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.894
MY BIOLOGY FINAL.
I PASSED, THANKS TO YOU.

07:39.894 --> 07:44.507
GOOD JOB, MYRA.
CONGRATULATIONS,
THAT'S GREAT.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.249
GEOMETRY IS ON FRIDAY.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.469
I DIDN'T KNOW IF MAYBE
YOU HAD SOME TIME.

07:49.469 --> 07:54.648
UH...LISTEN, I CAN'T.
I CAN'T.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.693
I'VE GOT THIS THING.
I'VE STARTED ANOTHER JOB.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.304
AND IT WORKS EVERY
NIGHT THIS WEEK.

07:59.304 --> 08:01.524
EVERY NIGHT, HUH?

08:01.524 --> 08:03.265
OK, I GET IT.

08:03.265 --> 08:06.268
YOU'RE LIKE THE PAPA
BIRD PUSHING ME OUT
OF THE NEST.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.226
MYRA, YOU'RE
GONNA DO GREAT. OK?

08:08.226 --> 08:09.793
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED ME.

08:09.793 --> 08:12.840
YOU KNOW, HALF OF THEM BREAK
THEIR LITTLE NECKS THOUGH.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.842
I MEAN, I SEE THEIR
TINY CARCASSES

08:14.842 --> 08:16.844
SPLATTERED ON
THE SIDEWALK.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.019
BUT HEY...

08:21.501 --> 08:22.676
MYRA, LISTEN.

08:22.676 --> 08:26.549
UH, MY SISTER
IS AWESOME AT MATH.

08:26.549 --> 08:27.768
I MEAN, MAYBE
SHE CAN HELP YOU.

08:27.768 --> 08:30.814
CLAUDIA?
BANANA GIRL?

08:30.814 --> 08:31.815
BANANA--

08:31.815 --> 08:32.860
REPUBLIC.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.862
ALL HER FRIENDS
WEAR IT.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.517
NOTE, PLEASE,
THE CONTRAST
TO ME.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.909
SHE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT ANY OF THAT.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.389
OK, JUST WAIT
HERE ONE SECOND,

08:40.389 --> 08:41.695
AND I'M GONNA
GO ASK HER. OK?

08:41.695 --> 08:42.957
CLAUDIA, HEY.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.525

08:55.578 --> 08:58.973
RINGWORM? THE ANGRIEST
STUDENT IN HIGH SCHOOL?

08:58.973 --> 09:00.714
YOU'LL BE FINE.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.106
OH, I THOUGHT YOU
LOVED ME, CHARLIE.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.586
I THOUGHT YOU CARED
IF I LIVED.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.807
MYRA, LISTEN.

09:06.807 --> 09:10.419
MYRA...CLAUDIA...
STUDY BUDDIES. OK?

09:21.778 --> 09:24.172
GUS.CHARLIE, HEY.

09:24.172 --> 09:27.218
I LOVED YOUR SCROLL WORK ON

09:27.218 --> 09:28.698
WELL, THANKS.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.526
DON'T BE MODEST.
THOSE ARE TRICKY
DEVILS.

09:30.526 --> 09:31.875
YOU NAILED 'EM.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.312
LISTEN, I DON'T WANNA
SOUND UNGRATEFUL,

09:34.312 --> 09:35.836
BUT I WAS WONDERING
IF UM...

09:35.836 --> 09:38.534
OH, NOW. I'M
ALREADY PAYING
YOU $20 AN HOUR.

09:38.534 --> 09:39.796
THAT'S THE MOST
I EVER PAY A
PART-TIMER.

09:39.796 --> 09:40.797
NO, NO.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.799
I DON'T WANT A RAISE, GUS.

09:42.799 --> 09:45.236
I WANT SOME EXTRA HOURS.

09:45.236 --> 09:48.109
I NEED AT LEAST 30 A WEEK.

09:48.109 --> 09:52.983
I DON'T HAVE MUCH
OF A BACKLOG IN
ORDERS, CHARLIE.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.638
I GOT GUYS WITH
SENIORITY HERE
WHEN I DO.

09:55.638 --> 09:59.381
WELL, I'M SORRY, GUS. BUT
I REALLY NEED THOSE HOURS,

09:59.381 --> 10:02.210

ALL RIGHT. YOU PUT
IT THAT WAY, OK.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.391
THANKS.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.349
WHATEVER YOU'RE SAVING FOR,
I HOPE YOU GET IT.

10:11.349 --> 10:16.093

10:16.093 --> 10:21.882
NO, NO. CAPTAIN FABULOUS
VERSUS THE BLOOD GUZZLER
IS THE UNDERCARD.

10:21.882 --> 10:24.972
YOU'RE THE PROMOTIONS
DEPARTMENT, YOU FIX IT.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.844

HELLO? HELLO? UGH!

10:30.847 --> 10:34.764

10:34.764 --> 10:35.983
YOU SHOULD
PROTEST, MAN.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.202
DAMN STRAIGHT.DON'T COME IN...

10:38.202 --> 10:40.378
FOR LIKE A WEEK.
SEE WHAT THEY DO HERE
WITHOUT YOU.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.076
MAN, I AM SO
READY TO DO THAT.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.078
OK. THEN LET'S GO.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.122
TRUCK'S OUTSIDE.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.515
HA HA. YOU'RE FUNNY.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.997
WHAT TRUCK?THE TRUCK.

10:49.997 --> 10:52.042
THE TRUCK WITH
SARAH'S STUFF ON IT.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.783
GRIFFIN AND I ARE
DRIVING IT ACROSS
COUNTRY.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.090
OK, YOU'RE LOSING ME HERE.I GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.787
JOE'S BACK IN TOWN
SO HE'S COVERING THE RESTAURANT,

10:57.787 --> 10:59.571
VICTOR'S GOT OWEN,

10:59.571 --> 11:01.182
AND GRIFFIN FOUND SOME HARLEY IN
BROOKLYN HE WANTS TO PICK UP,

11:01.182 --> 11:02.792
SO HE'S COMING WITH ME.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.316
ALL I NEED,
IS MY WING MAN.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.535
MY NAVIGATOR.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.581
BUT...3,000 MILES.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.061
YOU CAN'T JUST SHIP IT?

11:11.061 --> 11:12.715
IT WOULD COST A FORTUNE TO SHIP
ALL THAT STUFF.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.282
AND I WAS GONNA GO
VISIT SARAH ANYWAY,

11:14.282 --> 11:16.327
SO I'M SAVING MONEY
ON AIRFARE.

11:16.327 --> 11:19.766
BESIDES, IT'S A CHANCE FOR US TO
SEE THE WHOLE COUNTRY, WILL.
COME ON.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.551
I DON'T KNOW...

11:22.551 --> 11:24.727
YOU'RE AN UNPAID INTERN.
THEY OWE YOU.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.903
YEAH. WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY WON'T LET ME OFF.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.340
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
THIS IS A LITTLE INSANE?

11:29.340 --> 11:31.908
EXACTLY. THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.737
BECAUSE IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT MY GOOD BUDDY WILL
TOLD ME I SHOULD BE.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.173
AND YOU WERE RIGHT, MAN.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.262
IT'S IMPULSIVE,
IT'S SPONTANEOUS,

11:38.262 --> 11:40.221
IT'S TOTALLY OUT THERE.BAILEY...

11:40.221 --> 11:41.962
SARAH MOVED ACROSS
THE COUNTRY, WILL.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.878
I MISS HER. YOUR
COMPADRE IS IN PAIN.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.619
NOW IS THAT ANY LESS
IMPORTANT TO YOU THAN

11:47.619 --> 11:50.492
WHO'S ON THE UNDERCARD
WITH THE BLOOD GUZZLER?

11:52.755 --> 11:53.756
COME ON.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.280
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

11:58.630 --> 12:00.328
I SAY UH...

12:01.590 --> 12:02.722
SHOT GUN.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.685
RIGHT AND THEN I'LL SEE THEM ALL
DOWN IN THE LOBBY.

12:09.685 --> 12:13.602
YEAH. COCKTAILS, SURE.[KNOCK KNOCK]

12:13.602 --> 12:15.822
OH, JULIA.
COME ON IN.

12:15.822 --> 12:19.260
OK. WELL, I'LL
CALL YOU LATER.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.304
OK.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.654
HI.
HI.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.526
SO WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

12:26.006 --> 12:27.921
WELL, I CAME TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THE NOTE

12:27.921 --> 12:30.097
YOU SLID UNDER MY DOOR.
CHAPTER 7.

12:30.097 --> 12:33.100
OH, YEAH. I THOUGHT THERE WAS
SOME GREAT STUFF IN THERE.

12:33.100 --> 12:37.844
REALLY? I CAN'T TELL.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.628
I MEAN, YOU CROSSED OUT
THE ENTIRE SECTION

12:39.628 --> 12:41.064
ON HOW I MADE UP
WITH NED.

12:41.064 --> 12:44.807
WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A
LITTLE SIMPLISTIC.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.548
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:46.548 --> 12:50.726
WELL, THIS IDEA THAT WHAT
SMOOTHED THINGS OVER WAS ONLY...

12:50.726 --> 12:52.336
WELL, IT WAS ONLY...

12:52.336 --> 12:54.774
SEX?
YEAH.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.125
WELL, UM...SOMETIMES
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

12:58.125 --> 13:03.130
I BELIEVE YOU. IT JUST
SENDS OUT A STRANGE
MESSAGE, THAT'S ALL.

13:03.130 --> 13:06.394
EVAN, I'M WRITING
WHAT HAPPENED. I'M
NOT SENDING A MESSAGE.

13:06.394 --> 13:10.572
OK. BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE HOW
THAT AFFECTS READERS, JULIA.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.313
MEANING WHAT?

13:12.313 --> 13:13.749
HOW DO YOU THINK
IT AFFECTS THEM?

13:13.749 --> 13:15.707
I THINK THAT IT
MIGHT CONFUSE THEM.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.840
I THINK THAT IT MIGHT
DISCONNECT THEM FROM--

13:17.840 --> 13:20.930
WAIT. CONFUSE THEM
OR YOU?

13:20.930 --> 13:22.192
I'M SORRY?

13:22.192 --> 13:23.977
IT SEEMS YOU'RE
A LITTLE CONFUSED.

13:23.977 --> 13:27.458
DOES IT BOTHER YOU,
EVAN? THE IDEA OF
ME AND SEX?

13:27.458 --> 13:29.721
WH-WHY WOULD THAT?

13:31.158 --> 13:32.550
JULIA, I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT STILL STUCK

13:32.550 --> 13:35.075
ON THAT STUFF THAT
HAPPENED THE OTHER DAY.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.077
NO, NO.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.906
NOT AT ALL. I'M JUST
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.996
CAUSE YOU MIGHT BE
THE ONLY EDITOR ON
THE PLANET RIGHT NOW

13:42.996 --> 13:46.216
WHO'S ASKING THE WRITER
TO GIVE THEM LESS SEX.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.133
BUT IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.918
YOU'RE THE BOSS,
I GUESS.

14:05.061 --> 14:08.456
OK, NO JOKE. NOW I
REALLY HAVE TO PEE.

14:08.456 --> 14:11.328
WE JUST STOPPED IN RENO.THAT WAS 3 HOURS AGO.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.548
AND I NEARLY HAD TO CHEW
YOUR ARM OFF ON THE DONNER PASS

14:13.548 --> 14:15.071
TO GET US TO
A DRIVE-THRU.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.943
AND WHAT'S UP WITH YOU
NOT LETTING US GAMBLE?

14:16.943 --> 14:19.119
COME ON. RENO'S
A TOTAL CLICHE.

14:19.119 --> 14:22.513
YEAH. A TOTAL CLICHE
WITH PRACTICALLY NAKED
COCKTAIL WAITRESSES.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.907
GUYS, WE'RE MAKING
AMAZING TIME.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.474
8 HOURS AND
17 MINUTES

14:26.474 --> 14:28.084
AND WE'RE ALREADY HALF
WAY THROUGH NEVADA.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.085
YEAH. THAT'S BECAUSE
WE'VE BEEN IN THIS TRUCK

14:29.085 --> 14:30.565
SINCE 5:30 A.M.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.567
ESCAPED CONVICTS DON'T
TRAVEL AT THIS PACE.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.917
AND SERIOUSLY, YOU KNOW.
YOU ARE PUSHING THE ENGINE
PRETTY HARD.

14:34.917 --> 14:35.962
WE'RE CARRYING A LOT
OF WEIGHT BACK THERE.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.137
IN ADDITION
TO THE FACT--

14:37.137 --> 14:39.182
IN CASE I FAILED
TO MAKE THIS CLEAR,

14:39.182 --> 14:41.881
MY BLADDER'S ABOUT
TO EXPLODE ALL OVER
SARAH'S SUMMER WARDROBE.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.058
LOOK, JUST HOLD IT
IN TILL WE ALL HAVE
TO GO, OK?

14:45.058 --> 14:48.322
WE CAN'T KEEP
STOPPING IF WE WANT
TO STAY ON SCHEDULE.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.802
OK. WHEN DID WE DECIDE
THAT WE WERE SETTING

14:50.802 --> 14:52.239
A TRANSCONTINENTAL
SPEED RECORD?

14:52.239 --> 14:54.023
AND WHAT HAPPENED
TO SEEING THE SIGHTS?

14:54.023 --> 14:55.416
WE'RE SEEING THE SIGHTS.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.723
LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW.
SEE? SIGHTS.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.164
OK, LISTEN.

15:06.166 --> 15:09.169
THURSDAY IS MY 3rd
ANNIVERSARY WITH SARAH.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.692
OK. IT'S A VERY
IMPORTANT DATE.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.128
AND I'D REALLY LIKE US
TO BE TOGETHER.

15:13.651 --> 15:16.480
THURSDAY? AS IN
2 DAYS FROM NOW?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.004
YOU WANT TO BE
IN NEW YORK CITY,

15:18.004 --> 15:20.180
THE ONE NEXT TO
THE ATLANTIC OCEAN,
BY THURSDAY?

15:20.180 --> 15:22.486
I GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT.
IT'S EXACTLY 3,100 MILES

15:22.486 --> 15:24.793
FROM THE BAY BRIDGE
TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON
BRIDGE.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.100
THAT'S 17 HOURS A DAY
AT 60 MILES AN HOUR.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.319
IT'S CAKE. I MEAN, LOOK.
WE'VE ALREADY COVERED

15:29.319 --> 15:32.105
MORE THAN HALF
OF OUR MILEAGE QUOTA FOR
DAY ONE.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.020
I'LL GIVE YOU
20 BUCKS IF YOU
SAY YOU HAVE TO PEE.

15:34.020 --> 15:34.934
I HAVE TO PEE.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.116
GO FOR IT.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.772
OK, SO THE ANGLES
ALWAYS ADD UP TO 180.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.994
AND SO WHAT? WHY DO
I NEED TO KNOW THIS?

15:51.994 --> 15:53.343
CLAUDIA?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.439
TELL ME YOU DON'T
FEEL BAD FOR HER.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.791
MYRA...SHE'S MY FRIEND.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.446
COME ON. I MEAN,
SO SHE LOSES THE
FOOTBALL CAPTAIN.

16:09.446 --> 16:10.621
SO WHAT?

16:10.621 --> 16:12.014
NOW IT'S JUST
WHO'S NEXT,

16:12.014 --> 16:14.799
THE SOCCER CAPTAIN OR
THE BASKETBALL CAPTAIN?

16:14.799 --> 16:16.192
HEY, CLAUDIA.

16:16.192 --> 16:17.367
HEY.

16:24.592 --> 16:28.857
GOD, I JUST
WANNA CRY SO BAD.

16:28.857 --> 16:31.251
BUT I CAN'T LET
HIM SEE ME THAT WAY.

16:31.251 --> 16:35.298
I KNOW. BUT YOU GOTTA
FORGET ABOUT CAMERON.

16:35.298 --> 16:38.693
I'M TRYING. I'M TRYING.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.825
I MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA
MEET SOMEONE ELSE.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.871
IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES.

16:44.916 --> 16:47.006
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS PERSON, THEY'RE
GONNA BE BETTER.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.572
I MEAN THEY'RE GONNA
BE BETTER FOR YOU.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.226
I DON'T KNOW.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.141
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S TRUE.

16:52.141 --> 16:55.275
I MEAN...CAMERON...

16:55.275 --> 16:57.712
HE IS SO HARD TO KNOW.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.019
I MEAN, HE'S GOT
SO MANY SECRETS.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.151
I MEAN, IT TOOK HIM LIKE
A YEAR TO LET ME IN.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.719
BUT AFTER HE DID--

17:04.719 --> 17:09.289
I MEAN, WHO ELSE WILL
I EVER HAVE THAT WITH?

18:23.798 --> 18:26.322
CLAUDIA.
HI.

18:26.322 --> 18:27.628
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:27.628 --> 18:29.934
I JUST...CAMERON,
I JUST...

18:29.934 --> 18:31.371
I KIND OF NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

18:31.371 --> 18:32.894
I WISH YOU'D
CALLED FIRST.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.287
I KNOW.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

18:34.287 --> 18:37.159
BUT I COULDN'T SAY
THIS OVER THE PHONE.

18:37.159 --> 18:40.119
Karl: CAM, YOUR MOM
SAYS DINNER'S READY.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.252
CAMERON, THIS MAY SEEM WEIRD
AND YOU KNOW, KIND OF SUDDEN,

18:43.252 --> 18:45.820
BUT I WAS THINKING--

18:45.820 --> 18:49.693
CAM? OH, HELLO.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.130
HI.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.436
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU
HAD A LADY FRIEND.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.743
Cameron's Mom:
KARL? WE'D BETTER HURRY.

18:55.743 --> 18:59.181
WELL, UH, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME. DUTY CALLS.

19:02.097 --> 19:07.058
YOUR DAD, HE SEEMED LIKE
A PRETTY NICE GUY.

19:07.058 --> 19:10.845
HE IS. ONLY
HE'S NOT HERE.

19:10.845 --> 19:15.154
MY BUDDY KARL
IS NOT MY DAD.

19:16.764 --> 19:18.200
MY DAD WORKS LATE.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.769
KARL AND MY MOM...
HANG OUT.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.380
WOW. I--

19:24.380 --> 19:26.252
LOOK YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING, OK.

19:26.252 --> 19:29.516
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
I DO. SAY NOTHING.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.954
THAT WAY THEY GET TO
THINK I DON'T KNOW.

19:35.086 --> 19:38.177
LOOK, I GOTTA GO EAT.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.658
YOU WERE TELLING
ME SOMETHING.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.879
IT CAN WAIT.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.188
I'LL SEE YA.

19:58.588 --> 19:59.807
OK.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.027
WOW.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.333
YOU LOOK--

20:04.333 --> 20:05.987
OH, GOD. I'M
SORRY I'M LATE.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.380
ALL RIGHT
CANDLES, OK..

20:07.380 --> 20:09.164
ALL RIGHT
JUST GIVE ME
30 SECONDS

20:09.164 --> 20:10.731
TO GET THIS
TURPENTINE
OFF MY SKIN.

20:10.731 --> 20:11.949
HURRY UP.

20:14.125 --> 20:17.955
SO I GOT GUS TO GIVE
ME SOME MORE HOURS.

20:17.955 --> 20:20.523
10 ON TOP OF THE 20
THAT I ALREADY HAD.

20:23.570 --> 20:28.314
THAT SHOULD PRETTY
MUCH COVER THE I.V.F.

20:28.314 --> 20:32.622
WHICH JUST LEAVES
THE MEDS.

20:52.903 --> 20:55.341
I'VE BEEN DREAMING
ABOUT THIS ALL DAY.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.348
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M READING.

21:07.178 --> 21:11.139
A MINUTE AGO YOU WERE
LIKE, "COME HITHER."

21:11.139 --> 21:14.142
YOU BLINKED.
I HAD A HOT FLASH.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.665
END OF STORY.

21:16.971 --> 21:17.928
WOW.

21:20.757 --> 21:23.151
IT'S JUST
A MOOD SWING. OK?

21:23.151 --> 21:25.284
THE SHOTS CAN DO THAT.

21:27.721 --> 21:30.201
THIS DOESN'T MEAN
I'M DEPRESSED.

21:30.201 --> 21:35.076
MY DOCTORS ARE MONITORING
ME INCREDIBLY CLOSELY.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.295
I'M JUST...

21:38.645 --> 21:41.212
I'M JUST IRRITABLE.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.518
SO DON'T GIVE
ME THAT LOOK.

21:42.518 --> 21:43.737
OK.

21:45.216 --> 21:49.177
BUT, KIRSTEN. I MEAN,
WHAT ABOUT THE UH...

21:49.177 --> 21:51.962
THE TWICE A DAY THING?

21:51.962 --> 21:55.052
I MEAN I TOOK MY PILLS,
I WORE MY FROSTY BOXERS,

21:55.052 --> 21:57.316
AND THERE'S STILL
THAT...YOU KNOW.

21:59.056 --> 22:00.319
HANDLE IT YOURSELF.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.234
I'M GOING TO SLEEP.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.627
I CAN'T TELL FOR
SURE, BUT I THINK

22:04.627 --> 22:06.455
THE CYLINDER HEAD
MAY BE CRACKED.

22:06.455 --> 22:09.284
ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU'RE
A MECHANIC. FIX IT.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.025
I CAN GET US
TO THE NEXT TOWN,

22:11.025 --> 22:12.766
BUT IF IT'S
THE CYLINDER HEAD,

22:12.766 --> 22:14.942
WE'RE GONNA
NEED SOME PARTS.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.074
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S JUST GREAT.

22:17.074 --> 22:19.294
HO-HO-HO.
I'M A NEW MAN.

22:19.294 --> 22:20.469
LET'S HIT THE ROAD.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.166
NOT TONIGHT.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.777
WE'RE NOT GETTING
ANY FARTHER THAN
THE NEAREST HOTEL.

22:23.777 --> 22:26.301
EVEN BETTER.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.085
ALL RIGHT. AS LONG
AS WE'RE BACK ON
THE ROAD BY 8:00 A.M.

22:28.085 --> 22:29.217
WE SHOULD BE OK.

22:29.217 --> 22:31.741
THAT MAY BE
A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.352
I DON'T CARE IF
WE HAVE TO REPLACE
THE WHOLE ENGINE.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.744
WE'RE STAYING
ON SCHEDULE.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.050
BAILEY, I KNOW
YOU'RE A MAN WITH A MISSION.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.921
BUT LET'S FACE FACTS.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.662
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL WE'RE
GONNA MAKE NEW YORK BY THURSDAY.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.055
WE HAVE TO.

22:41.055 --> 22:42.186
SARAH'S NOT GONNA
CARE IF YOU'RE A DAY

22:42.186 --> 22:43.927
OR 2 LATE. JUST
GIVE HER A CALL.

22:43.927 --> 22:44.928
I CAN'T DO THAT.

22:44.928 --> 22:47.235
Will: WHY NOT?

22:47.235 --> 22:48.889
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T
KNOW I'M COMING.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.893
WAIT. HELP ME OUT HERE.

22:52.893 --> 22:56.331
WE'RE DRIVING 3,000
MILES AND SARAH HAS
NO IDEA YOU'RE COMING?

22:56.331 --> 22:57.724
NO.

22:59.290 --> 23:02.511
WELL, WHAT IF WE GET
THERE AND SHE'S GONE?

23:02.511 --> 23:04.339
WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON
DOING WITH HER STUFF?

23:04.339 --> 23:06.559
THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT HER STUFF.
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

23:06.559 --> 23:09.344
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT I WOULD DRIVE 3,000 MILES

23:09.344 --> 23:10.345
JUST TO BRING HER
HER STUFF?

23:10.345 --> 23:11.738
THEN WHY ARE YOU?

23:13.130 --> 23:14.915
I HAVE TO
SURPRISE HER.

23:14.915 --> 23:17.134
SURPRISE HER?YES.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.441
I'M MAKING A STATEMENT.
I'M PROVING A POINT.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.922
SO SHE CAN'T SAY NO.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.576
NO TO WHAT?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.142
NO TO COMING BACK HOME.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.537
I'M GONNA BRING
SARAH BACK HOME.

23:38.939 --> 23:41.289
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY
TO COME BY WITHOUT
CALLING FIRST,

23:41.289 --> 23:42.725
BUT WE RAN OUT
OF DIPIES.

23:42.725 --> 23:43.726
[BABY CRYING]

23:43.726 --> 23:45.859
OH, IT'S OK.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.817
AND MONEY TOO.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.080
UM, BECAUSE I DIDN'T
GET YOUR CHECK YET,

23:50.080 --> 23:51.473
WHICH IS NO BIGGIE.

23:51.473 --> 23:53.301
WOULD YOU GO GET HER
DROOLPROOF DUCKIE BOOK?

23:53.301 --> 23:54.302
IT'S IN THE BATHROOM.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.651
YES, I CAN DO THAT.

23:59.307 --> 24:00.917
CALM DOWN, YOU KNOW.

24:00.917 --> 24:04.878
GO VISIT THE
RED BUDDHA OF
LIMITLESS LIGHTS...

24:04.878 --> 24:09.448
THE UH, TEN WORLDS,
YOU KNOW?

24:12.625 --> 24:14.322
I'M SORRY, WHAT
WERE YOU SAYING?

24:14.322 --> 24:16.411
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE
A BABY WITH KIRSTEN?

24:17.934 --> 24:22.373
WHAT? NO. WHY WOULD
YOU THINK THAT?

24:22.373 --> 24:25.899
UH, MAYBE
YOUR COBRA PENIS.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.641
AND THEN OF COURSE
THERE'S THIS.

24:28.641 --> 24:32.166
UH...WE WERE KEEPING
IT A SECRET.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.210
MM-HMM.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.343
BUT, YEAH.

24:35.343 --> 24:36.953
WE'RE DOING IT
IN VITRO.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.826
YOU KNOW, WHERE
YOU TAKE THE EGGS
OUT AND--

24:39.826 --> 24:41.001
OH, YEAH. NO, I TOTALLY
KNOW ABOUT THEM.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.611
MY FRIEND ANGIE DID THAT.

24:42.611 --> 24:44.700
YEAH. WELL, IT'S JUST, IT'S
KIND OF STRESSFUL.

24:44.700 --> 24:48.312
AND EXPENSIVE WHICH IS
WHY WE'VE BEEN ACTING
A LITTLE WEIRD LATELY.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.792
NO, NO, YOU TOTALLY
DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.315
WHICH IS WHY WE'VE
BEEN KEEPING IT QUIET.

24:51.315 --> 24:54.318
YOU KNOW. BECAUSE ALL
THAT STUFF PLUS IT'S...

24:54.318 --> 24:55.798
IT'S STILL
A REAL LONG SHOT.

24:55.798 --> 25:00.107
CHARLIE, I THINK
IT'S AWESOME.

25:00.107 --> 25:01.717
YOU DO?

25:01.717 --> 25:04.590
I DO.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.765
IT'S AWESOME.

25:09.159 --> 25:12.293
AND HEY. YOU KNOW, AS LONG
AS WE'RE SHARING GOOD NEWS,

25:12.293 --> 25:14.382
I SHOULD TELL YOU
THAT I GOT A JOB.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.732
YOU DID?
YEAH.

25:16.732 --> 25:18.081
THAT'S GREAT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING?

25:18.081 --> 25:19.996
CAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO JINX IT, YOU KNOW.

25:19.996 --> 25:23.522
SO AS OF PRETTY SOON,
I'M COMPLETELY OFF
YOUR LIST OF WORRIES.

25:30.877 --> 25:33.749
GOTTA ORDER THE PART
FROM MY SUPPLIER IN CASPER.

25:33.749 --> 25:35.534
TAKE 2 DAYS TO GET
IT HERE, MINIMUM.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.493
THAT'S IF
I GIVE IT A RUSH.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.843
LOOK, MAN. IF THIS IS
JUST SOME KIND OF SCAM

25:40.843 --> 25:42.366
TO JACK UP THE PRICE
OF THE REPAIR--

25:42.366 --> 25:43.498
HOW'S THAT?

25:43.498 --> 25:45.456
UM, EXCUSE
US A SECOND.

25:45.456 --> 25:48.677
BAILEY, YOU NEED TO
LIGHTEN UP HERE, OK.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.418
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF GOD-KNOWS-WHERE
WYOMING.

25:50.418 --> 25:51.724
WE'RE LUCKY THIS
GUY'S GOT A PHONE--

25:51.724 --> 25:53.769
HE'S GONNA COST US
2 EXTRA DAYS, WILL.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.641
YOU KEEP PISSING HIM
OFF AND HE'S GONNA COST
US A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.120
WE'LL END UP ON THE BACK
OF A MILK CARTON.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.209
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO SCREW AROUND.

25:59.209 --> 26:01.342
BAILEY, YOU NEED TO LIKE, TAKE A
BREATH, ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE
SCARING ME.

26:01.342 --> 26:03.779
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SCARED TOO, WILL.

26:07.740 --> 26:10.090
THIS WHOLE THING THAT
I'M DOING WITH SARAH--

26:10.090 --> 26:11.352
THIS WHOLE TRIP HERE.

26:11.352 --> 26:13.659
IT'S A LONG SHOT, OK.
I KNOW THAT.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.965
BUT I DON'T KNOW
ANY OTHER WAY.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.578
SHE HAS TO SEE ME.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.844
AND MAYBE SHE'LL HEAR
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY

26:24.844 --> 26:27.847
AND DECIDE NOT
TO COME HOME WITH ME.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.285
BUT I HAVE TO TRY.

26:35.289 --> 26:38.118
NOW, LAST UP...

26:38.118 --> 26:40.642
SLATED FOR A MID-WINTER
FIRST PRINTING,

26:40.642 --> 26:45.647
A MEMOIR BY THE VERY
TALENTED YOUNG WRITER
SITTING NEXT TO ME HERE,

26:45.647 --> 26:47.910
JULIA SALINGER.

26:47.910 --> 26:51.218
[APPLAUSE]

26:51.218 --> 26:56.092
JULIA TAKES A FRANK LOOK
AT THE SOCIAL AND FAMILIAL
CONTEXT THAT LED HER

26:56.092 --> 26:58.704
TO STAY IN AN ABUSIVE
RELATIONSHIP.

26:58.704 --> 27:01.141
SHE TRIES TO OFFER SOME
ANSWERS TO WOMEN LIKE HER,

27:01.141 --> 27:02.708
WHETHER THEY'VE
SUFFERED ABUSE--

27:02.708 --> 27:06.494
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT SAYING
THAT I HAVE ANY ANSWERS.

27:08.670 --> 27:12.108
UH, IT'S ONE WOMAN'S
STORY TOLD FROM BOTH
SIDES OF THE PROBLEM,

27:12.108 --> 27:14.023
TO GIVE ILLUMINATION
AND HOPE TO PEOPLE--

27:14.023 --> 27:15.546
I'M SORRY,
CAN I JUST...?

27:15.546 --> 27:19.115
I'M SORRY,
I JUST WANNA CLARIFY.

27:19.115 --> 27:22.162
UM, I'M NOT SAYING THAT
I HAVE ANY ANSWERS.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.467
PLEASE DON'T BE
LOOKING FOR THAT.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.731
UM, I'M JUST
TRYING TO TELL MY STORY.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.734
AND HOPEFULLY THAT'LL
MAKE PEOPLE THINK.

27:29.822 --> 27:30.953
THAT'S ALL.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.263
I BELIEVE THE SAMPLE CHAPTER
THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN

27:36.263 --> 27:39.222
WILL CLARIFY HOW THE
BOOK SPEAKS TO PEOPLE--

27:39.222 --> 27:41.094
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST ONE MORE THING...

27:41.094 --> 27:44.010
WHAT EVAN JUST SAID.
YOU GUYS ARE THE FIRST
PEOPLE TO READ THIS.

27:44.010 --> 27:47.056
SO ANY REACTIONS THAT
YOU HAVE I WOULD LOVE
TO HEAR.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.536
ESPECIALLY ANY WOMEN--

27:51.757 --> 27:54.455
I'M SORRY, SHOULD
I BE WAITING TILL
YOU'RE DONE?

27:54.455 --> 27:56.239
GO AHEAD.

27:57.545 --> 28:00.591
UM...HI. WHAT'S
YOUR QUESTION?

28:14.649 --> 28:15.606
YES.

28:16.651 --> 28:17.870
HEY.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.828
HOW YOU DOIN'?

28:19.828 --> 28:22.788
HOW'S THE, UH...
THE STUDYING COMING?

28:22.788 --> 28:25.834
ARE YOU ASKING ME
AS A FRIEND?

28:25.834 --> 28:27.793
'CAUSE IF THAT'S
THE CASE,

28:27.793 --> 28:31.013
IF I'M YOUR
SO-CALLED FRIEND...
I'M NOT SO SURE.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.450
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

28:33.450 --> 28:39.021
HERE. NEXT TIME YOU LEND
YOUR GEOMETRY TEXTBOOK
TO SOMEONE,

28:39.021 --> 28:41.676
MAKE SURE YOU CHECK IT
FOR NOTES AND STUFF.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.547
WHAT'S...IN HERE?

28:45.854 --> 28:48.727
CAMERON. HE'S IN
YOUR GEOMETRY CLASS,
RIGHT?

28:48.727 --> 28:54.471
YEAH. I GUESS THAT'S
WHO "C" WAS.

28:54.471 --> 28:57.213
HE'S THE ONE THAT
SCRIBBLES PLACES
FOR YOU TO MEET,

28:57.213 --> 29:00.042
AND THINGS LIKE,
"HEY, DOES 'A'
KNOW?"

29:00.042 --> 29:03.698
"A" BEING ALEXA,
I ASSUME.

29:07.267 --> 29:09.617
YOU PROUD OF ME,
TEACHER?

29:09.617 --> 29:11.662
I FIGURED IT OUT.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.667
SURE.
I'M SORRY.

29:16.667 --> 29:20.584
LISTEN, THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE TRYING TO HIJACK
A PANEL LIKE THAT,

29:20.584 --> 29:22.108
TRY TO GIVE ME
A WARNING, OK?

29:22.108 --> 29:24.240
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.374
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SPEND ALL THOSE
HOURS WRITING A MARKETING
PRESENTATION

29:27.374 --> 29:29.115
JUST TO HEAR
MYSELF TALK.

29:29.115 --> 29:31.508
I KNOW. YOU'RE RIGHT.THESE PEOPLE NEED TO LEAVE HERE

29:31.508 --> 29:34.511
WITH A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT THOSE
BOOKS ARE ABOUT, JULIA.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.557
RIGHT.

29:36.557 --> 29:39.821
WELL, ONE PERSON
DEFINITELY HEARD
WHAT I WAS SAYING.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.388
WHO?

29:41.388 --> 29:42.737
ME.

29:42.737 --> 29:44.391
LOOK, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

29:44.391 --> 29:47.220
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU HAVEN'T ADDED A TON,

29:47.220 --> 29:48.569
BUT ALL ALONG,
THE WAY WE'VE WORKED

29:48.569 --> 29:50.614
IS I LET YOU TELL ME
HOW TO WRITE THIS BOOK.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.181
YOU ASKED ME
TO EDIT YOU.

29:52.181 --> 29:53.792
THAT IS ALL
THAT I DID.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.011
I KNOW. EVAN...
I'M BLAMING MYSELF.

29:56.011 --> 29:59.798
THE THING IS,
SITTING ON THAT STAGE,
FACING ALL THOSE PEOPLE,

29:59.798 --> 30:02.670
IT'S LIKE A LIGHT
WENT OFF IN MY HEAD.

30:02.670 --> 30:06.935
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
SOMEONE TO TELL ME WHAT
THIS BOOK SHOULD SOUND LIKE,

30:06.935 --> 30:09.068
AND NOW I KNOW.
I FINALLY REALIZE

30:09.068 --> 30:11.200
THIS BOOK
SHOULD SOUND LIKE ME.

30:11.200 --> 30:15.509
SO...SO THANK YOU.
BECAUSE WHAT YOU SAID

30:15.509 --> 30:18.077
ABOUT HAVING ALL
THE POWER BETWEEN US,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

30:18.077 --> 30:21.602
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL ME TO TAKE CONTROL,
AND NOW I AM.

30:21.602 --> 30:24.823
THIS BOOK IS FINALLY
MINE AGAIN, AND THAT
FEELS GREAT,

30:24.823 --> 30:27.216
SO...THANK YOU.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.224
CHARLIE?

30:36.617 --> 30:38.662
IT'S MIDNIGHT.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.839
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE HOME AT 9:00.

30:40.839 --> 30:44.016
WELL...GUS HAD
AN ORDER FOR
END TABLES.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.844
NEXT-DAY DELIVERY.
I HAD TO STAY,

30:45.844 --> 30:47.628
OR I WOULD'VE
LOST THE HOURS.

30:47.628 --> 30:49.369
I'M GONNA GO
GET UNDRESSED.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.762
KIRSTEN, WAIT A MINUTE.

30:51.762 --> 30:54.548
I CAN'T. OK?

30:54.548 --> 30:56.942
I'M JUST--
I'M TOO OUT OF IT.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.508
CHARLIE, WE HAVE TO.

30:58.508 --> 31:01.816
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO, OK?
I'M TOTALLY BEAT.

31:01.816 --> 31:04.297
I JUST GOTTA TAKE A SHOWER
AND GO TO BED.

31:04.297 --> 31:05.689
A HOT SHOWER?

31:05.689 --> 31:07.778
'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
IT'S SUPPOSED TO--

31:07.778 --> 31:10.259
COULD YOU PLEASE
NOT DO THAT RIGHT NOW?

31:10.259 --> 31:13.436
YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T
EASY ON ME, EITHER.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.704
WHEN I GOT OFF
WORK TONIGHT...

31:20.704 --> 31:25.666
I GOT IN MY TRUCK,
AND I SAT THERE,
AND I THOUGHT...

31:25.666 --> 31:29.322
"NOW I HAVE TO GO
HOME AND HAVE SEX
WITH MY WIFE."

31:31.498 --> 31:33.848
AND, MAN, I MEAN,
FOR A SPLIT SECOND
THERE,

31:33.848 --> 31:37.547
I HAD THE URGE
TO GO BACK IN THERE
AND WORK.

31:37.547 --> 31:40.463
LIKE...I'D RATHER
GO BACK IN THERE

31:40.463 --> 31:42.030
AND MAKE
ANOTHER END TABLE

31:42.030 --> 31:45.033
THAN TO COME HOME
AND MAKE LOVE
TO MY WIFE.

31:48.210 --> 31:49.820
I MEAN...

31:49.820 --> 31:52.780
WE'RE MAKING A BABY
HERE, KIRSTEN.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.391
THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN.

31:55.391 --> 31:59.613
AND IT JUST...
IT JUST FEELS BAD

31:59.613 --> 32:02.224
TO BE WORKING
ON MAKING A BABY
WITH YOU

32:02.224 --> 32:06.620
AND CATCHING MYSELF
WONDERING WHY.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.632
WE'RE ALL SET.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.460
I GOT ANOTHER SHOP
TO MESSENGER THE PARTS,

32:20.460 --> 32:23.289
SO WE SHOULD BE
BACK ON THE ROAD BY NOON.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.118
WHAT?

32:30.774 --> 32:32.124
WHAT?

32:32.124 --> 32:33.908
WILL AND ME,
UH...

32:33.908 --> 32:36.737
WE'RE THINKING
OF CATCHING A BUS
BACK HOME.

32:36.737 --> 32:39.305
WHAT? YOU WHAT?

32:39.305 --> 32:41.568
I DON'T GET IT.
YOU GUYS ARE
BAGGIN' ON ME?

32:41.568 --> 32:43.831
BAILEY, THIS TRIP...

32:43.831 --> 32:46.616
SUDDENLY, IT'S
NOTHING IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE.

32:46.616 --> 32:49.750
WHY, BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT STOPPING TO SEE

32:49.750 --> 32:51.621
THE WORLD'S TALLEST
THERMOMETER?

32:51.621 --> 32:53.623
THAT'S PART OF IT.

32:53.623 --> 32:56.409
LOOK, THERE'S
PLENTY OF TIME TO DO
ALL THAT STUFF

32:56.409 --> 32:57.801
ON THE WAY BACK.

32:57.801 --> 33:01.675
YEAH, MAYBE SO,
BUT...I DON'T KNOW.

33:01.675 --> 33:04.983
WILL, HEY...YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO TOLD ME

33:04.983 --> 33:07.463
THAT I SHOULD TAKE
SOME CHANCES, RIGHT?

33:07.463 --> 33:09.378
THAT I SHOULDN'T
PLAY THINGS SAFE.

33:09.378 --> 33:12.164
SO NOW I'M TAKING
YOUR ADVICE, AND
YOU'RE BAILING ON ME?

33:12.164 --> 33:14.644
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
THAT'S WHY THIS
FEELS SO WRONG.

33:14.644 --> 33:18.953
'CAUSE YOU'RE STANDING
THERE ACTING LIKE THIS

THIS IS YOU CHASING

TRYING TO HOLD ON.

YOU'RE, LIKE, SCARED
TO LET ANYTHING CHANGE.

ADVICE FROM YOU TWO GUYS.

WHAT DID YOU DO?

33:39.626 --> 33:42.498
YOU LET HER GO.
YOU TOTALLY TANKED
ON YOUR OWN MARRIAGE.

33:42.498 --> 33:45.719
AND YOU, WHAT'S
THE LONGEST YOU'VE EVER
HUNG IN WITH A GIRL?

33:45.719 --> 33:47.634
A MONTH? MAYBE 2?

33:47.634 --> 33:49.549

I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD GO THERE!

33:52.291 --> 33:54.119
MAYBE THAT'S YOU GUYS,
BUT I DON'T DO THAT.

FROM PEOPLE.

ON MY FRIENDS.

QUITTING ON YOU?
LEAVING WORK,

THOUSANDS OF MILES
TO HEAR THIS?!

I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
SARAH KNOWS THAT
I'M STILL HERE.

34:04.825 --> 34:07.088
I'LL MAKE SURE
SO SHE CAN'T WALK AWAY.

AROUND THIS HOTEL

TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IS GOING ON.

I'VE WORKED WITH
HUNDREDS OF AUTHORS,

NONE OF THEM--

THERE ARE THINGS
THAT YOU DO, AND THERE
ARE THINGS YOU DON'T DO.

TALKING ABOUT?

SUPPOSED TO..?

TO PICK UP THE BABY,

36:44.158 --> 36:46.987
AND, ACTUALLY, I
COULD USE A LITTLE
FAVOR FROM YOU.

36:46.987 --> 36:49.163

COULD WATCH HER FOR
JUST A LITTLE WHILE

TO FIND A JOB,

GETS BACK FROM

SOME EXTRA MONEY

TO STAY FOR JUST
A LITTLE BIT.

HOW UPSET ALEXA WAS,

38:19.166 --> 38:23.823
I FELT BAD FOR HER,
AND THEN WHEN I WAS
AT YOUR HOUSE,

38:23.823 --> 38:25.433

KIND OF PERSON, CAMERON.

FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR."
