<i>El Gato!</i>

00:33.699 --> 00:36.308
<b>2x02- "Moles"</b>

00:48.262 --> 00:49.721
So much destruction.

00:50.555 --> 00:52.933
If only it could have been
avoided somehow.

00:53.016 --> 00:55.352
Of course it could have been avoided!

00:55.436 --> 00:57.813
This is your fault,
Puss in the Boots.

00:57.896 --> 00:59.331
Everything would be fine

00:59.332 --> 01:01.484
if you hadn't brought
that dragon to town!

01:02.151 --> 01:03.444
We do not know that.

01:03.527 --> 01:05.404
I might have brought something worse.

01:05.488 --> 01:07.697
Anyway, this damage is not so bad.

01:07.781 --> 01:10.242
Puss, the dragon broke your litter box.

01:14.037 --> 01:15.164
No, no.

01:15.998 --> 01:18.375
No! No. No. No. No!

01:31.263 --> 01:33.723
I will fix this town and my litter box,

01:33.849 --> 01:35.225
no matter what the cost.

01:35.309 --> 01:36.810
This I swear.

01:38.187 --> 01:39.522
Danger afoot!

01:39.604 --> 01:41.857
Sadly, I must abandon the hammering.

01:43.567 --> 01:44.985
<i>Fix this town!</i>

01:48.030 --> 01:50.782
What is it? Who is dying?
Where do I punch?

01:50.991 --> 01:53.076
It's the vegetables, Puss.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.328
They're...

01:54.411 --> 01:55.620
...they're all gone.

01:55.829 --> 01:57.914
Including the cucumbers.

01:57.998 --> 02:00.584
They hadn't even been pickled yet.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.295
They were still so young!

02:04.338 --> 02:05.922
This reaction you are having,

02:06.006 --> 02:07.716
it seems a bit strong.

02:07.799 --> 02:08.675
Really?

02:08.758 --> 02:11.928
This from the guy who was just
crying over his poo box?

02:13.638 --> 02:17.518
Puss, the children have really put
a lot of work into these vegetables.

02:18.519 --> 02:22.523
Also, I think they're a little emotional
about all the damage to the town.

02:22.606 --> 02:26.026
Their garden was one of the few things
that wasn't ruined, and...

02:26.109 --> 02:27.152
Well, and now...

02:27.944 --> 02:29.196
Understood.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.073
I will find the vegetables.

02:31.281 --> 02:32.657
This I swear!

02:32.741 --> 02:33.783
<i>Yay!</i>

02:34.368 --> 02:36.370
So, uh, how you gonna do that?

02:37.538 --> 02:40.207
I could use my finely honed
skills of deduction.

02:41.958 --> 02:43.293
Or I could just...

02:44.628 --> 02:46.922
...follow the smell of vegetable stew.

02:50.593 --> 02:52.595
Mm.

03:00.603 --> 03:02.271
Huh?

03:06.483 --> 03:07.401
Jack Sprat!

03:09.736 --> 03:12.864
How dare you steal
the vegetables of orphans?

03:12.948 --> 03:14.950
That is despicable,
even for you.

03:15.784 --> 03:17.453
I am so sorry, Puss.

03:17.536 --> 03:19.413
I was just so hungry.

03:20.956 --> 03:22.625
What has happened to you, Jack?

03:22.707 --> 03:24.918
You look like you have
fallen on hard times.

03:25.127 --> 03:28.380
No, hard times have fallen on me.

03:28.589 --> 03:34.344
Oh, since last I saw you,
things have gone terribles for me.

03:36.096 --> 03:40.476
<i>My holistic gymnasium failed,
leaving me destitute.</i>

03:42.144 --> 03:44.938
<i>None of my old friends would help.</i>

03:47.941 --> 03:51.861
<i>Possibly because I had betrayed
them all at one time or another.</i>

03:54.448 --> 03:57.200
<i>And what little money I had left...</i>

03:58.160 --> 04:00.162
<i>was taken by raccoons.</i>

04:03.624 --> 04:04.791
And now...

04:05.000 --> 04:09.754
...here I am, reduced to stealing food.

04:10.422 --> 04:13.091
Food! I am hungry.

04:13.967 --> 04:16.803
You could have come to me, Jack.

04:16.970 --> 04:18.555
I was too embarrassed!

04:18.639 --> 04:20.599
I have treated you so badly, Puss.

04:20.683 --> 04:23.768
I couldn't possibly ask
for your help again.

04:25.688 --> 04:26.605
Could I?

04:27.564 --> 04:29.274
I have a feeling you are going to.

04:30.775 --> 04:34.029
All right, I need your help.

04:34.196 --> 04:37.616
There is a treasure beyond compare,
buried beneath San Lorenzo.

04:37.824 --> 04:40.327
All that is required is digging.

04:41.704 --> 04:43.330
And why should I trust you?

04:44.373 --> 04:46.166
Well, you probably should not.

04:50.045 --> 04:53.507
That may be the first honest thing
you have ever said to me.

04:55.384 --> 04:58.178
It is true,
I am untrustworthy.

04:58.303 --> 05:00.972
But your town is in need of repairs.

05:01.056 --> 05:03.600
So, you could fix it all yourself...

05:03.767 --> 05:05.435
I do not like the manual labor.

05:05.602 --> 05:09.814
...or you could use this treasure
to pay others to do it for you.

05:12.901 --> 05:14.486
We start digging at once!

05:34.757 --> 05:37.760
Puss! After all Jack has done,
how can you trust that...

05:37.884 --> 05:39.135
that...

05:39.219 --> 05:41.304
Lovable rogue?

05:41.388 --> 05:42.765
Horse's bottom!

05:45.768 --> 05:46.935
I'm sorry, Babieca.

05:47.018 --> 05:49.438
That was an insult...
to your bottom.

05:50.522 --> 05:52.107
<i>I understand your concern,</i>

05:52.274 --> 05:55.402
<i>but this is the only way to pay
for the repairs San Lorenzo needs.</i>

05:55.569 --> 05:58.988
He's gonna get you into trouble!
He always does!

05:59.072 --> 06:00.490
<i>It is a buried treasure.</i>

06:00.699 --> 06:02.284
What kind of trouble can there be?

06:02.367 --> 06:04.911
There is nothing down here
but roots and bugs,

06:04.994 --> 06:06.329
and the occasional mole.

06:06.496 --> 06:09.499
I don't know. San Lorenzo
is built on magical land.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.752
Even the rock beneath it
is full of magic.

06:11.876 --> 06:14.129
There could be anything down there.

06:14.337 --> 06:18.508
Everything will be fine,
Goody Two-Shoes.

06:21.637 --> 06:22.805
Ooh!

06:27.183 --> 06:29.269
<i>Ouch.
- Get your shovel, Jack.</i>

06:29.352 --> 06:30.937
I feel that we are close to...

06:31.980 --> 06:32.939
something?

06:40.363 --> 06:42.491
Do... not... move.

06:46.495 --> 06:47.996
Whoa! Whoa!

06:50.666 --> 06:51.541
Oh!

06:54.961 --> 06:58.214
Ha! Thank you for breaking...

07:04.095 --> 07:07.891
It is... some kind of
underground civilization!

07:09.058 --> 07:10.435
Oui, mon frere.

07:10.519 --> 07:14.773
We are having an adventure,
just like the old days.

07:14.981 --> 07:17.526
Puss and Jack,
together again!

07:17.609 --> 07:18.985
<i>Huh?</i>

07:23.866 --> 07:27.870
Come on, Jack. Whatever that thing is,
it is beneath San Lorenzo.

07:27.952 --> 07:29.954
I must find out if it is a threat.

07:46.513 --> 07:47.806
Ugh!

07:47.890 --> 07:49.641
What are those?

07:49.850 --> 07:52.143
Huh?
- Huh?

07:54.187 --> 07:55.522
Seize them.

08:00.777 --> 08:03.488
Seize, seize, seize!

08:06.074 --> 08:07.701
Jack, we should retreat.

08:08.535 --> 08:09.912
Jack!

08:18.628 --> 08:20.589
Jack, Jack, Jack!

08:20.672 --> 08:21.590
Where are you?

08:28.263 --> 08:29.639
<i>Ah-ha!</i>

08:31.516 --> 08:32.392
Hey!

08:36.270 --> 08:37.272
Whoa.

08:41.902 --> 08:42.818
Uh-oh.

09:09.178 --> 09:11.222
I captured him for you.

09:12.390 --> 09:14.142
Aw, look at that.

09:14.225 --> 09:16.185
One of them betrayed the other.

09:16.269 --> 09:17.771
That's so cute.

09:20.607 --> 09:23.819
None may intrude on the palace
of the King of the Mole People,

09:23.902 --> 09:25.111
who is me!

09:25.194 --> 09:28.197
I know why you're here.
You are thieves!

09:28.281 --> 09:30.033
Thieves come to steal my treasure.

09:30.199 --> 09:32.494
We are not thieves.

09:33.202 --> 09:34.287
Well, he might be.

09:36.289 --> 09:38.834
Jack, we cannot deny
that we've come here for treasure.

09:39.001 --> 09:41.044
I knew it.
You want my bally.

09:43.588 --> 09:47.592
My precious bally!
My bally of great price.

09:47.676 --> 09:50.345
The most valuable object
in all the world.

09:50.428 --> 09:51.805
It's my bally!

09:51.888 --> 09:54.724
My bally, my bally,
my bally, my bally!

09:55.684 --> 09:57.019
Uh, no.

09:59.270 --> 10:00.647
Wait, you don't want bally?

10:00.814 --> 10:02.065
We do not want your bally.

10:02.273 --> 10:04.860
Really?
Because you can totally have it.

10:04.943 --> 10:06.402
Go ahead. Take it.
It's yours.

10:06.611 --> 10:07.779
I don't mind.

10:09.238 --> 10:11.950
Go on. Go on.
Go on.

10:12.034 --> 10:12.993
Not interested.

10:14.369 --> 10:16.872
You can't really have it.

10:16.955 --> 10:18.874
It was a test.
You guys passed.

10:19.041 --> 10:20.166
You're all right.

10:20.249 --> 10:23.127
So, which of the underground kingdoms
do you come from?

10:23.211 --> 10:26.297
There's Pellucidar,
Agartha, Symzonia...

10:26.381 --> 10:29.342
There are other underground kingdoms?

10:29.551 --> 10:31.511
Yeah, of course.

10:31.594 --> 10:33.513
The Megamicres are right under us.

10:33.596 --> 10:34.514
Check this out.

10:36.307 --> 10:39.061
<i>Hey, hold it down up there!</i>

10:41.229 --> 10:44.691
Your Majesty, I swear to you
that we did not mean to intrude.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.568
We did not even know you were here.

10:46.651 --> 10:48.904
We come from the surface,
above you.

10:50.238 --> 10:52.490
You guys live on the surface?

10:52.574 --> 10:54.409
Like up in the sunlight and stuff?

10:54.492 --> 10:55.535
That's disgusting.

10:55.618 --> 10:56.536
Oh, no, no, no.

10:56.703 --> 11:00.498
Fresh air and open space
are good for your chakras!

11:00.707 --> 11:02.458
You've been up there all this time,

11:02.542 --> 11:04.920
walking around,
living and breathing and stuff?

11:05.087 --> 11:07.589
<i>Ew!
- Ew!</i>

11:07.756 --> 11:10.842
Ugh! I feel like there's bugs in my hair,
I can't get 'em out!

11:10.926 --> 11:13.469
I'm freakin' out here.
I'm freakin' out! I...

11:13.553 --> 11:15.304
Wait, hang on,
there's something going on.

11:19.350 --> 11:21.269
Look at him.

11:21.352 --> 11:23.396
Oh, he's great.
Look at this guy.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.818
What do you think that orb is?

11:28.902 --> 11:29.819
I do not know.

11:29.903 --> 11:31.696
Please, remember why we are here.

11:32.655 --> 11:34.741
Your Majesty.
- Huh?

11:34.950 --> 11:36.743
We have come seeking jewels.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.745
We thought they were merely buried here.

11:38.870 --> 11:40.371
If they belong to you,
we will not...

11:40.455 --> 11:41.748
What the heck are chools?

11:41.915 --> 11:42.916
Jewels.

11:42.999 --> 11:44.834
Gems, precious stones.

11:44.918 --> 11:48.546
They are glittering rocks,
found in bright colors, like crystals.

11:48.713 --> 11:52.341
Oh, you mean shine-shine lumps.

11:52.425 --> 11:55.762
Oh, I hate those things.
You ever step on one?

11:55.845 --> 11:57.597
They really get jammed up in there.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.141
There's a ton of 'em in the dump.

11:59.307 --> 12:02.060
Take as many as you want,
you'll be doing me a favor.

12:02.226 --> 12:06.272
Take them to the dump.
Thus commands your king.

12:10.777 --> 12:11.945
Yeah, you tell 'em.

12:15.782 --> 12:18.910
Ah! _

12:19.077 --> 12:20.703
That is a lot of jewels!

12:20.912 --> 12:23.289
This is what I said.

12:23.498 --> 12:26.126
I know. I was translating
for our friends here.

12:26.209 --> 12:28.419
That's very considerate of you.

12:29.171 --> 12:30.880
He said we're friends!

12:31.006 --> 12:33.800
Jack, do you have any
empty treasure sacks?

12:34.258 --> 12:35.218
Whoa!

12:37.512 --> 12:38.680
Not anymore.

12:40.640 --> 12:41.516
Your Majesty,

12:41.683 --> 12:44.060
I'm pleased that our worlds
could come together

12:44.144 --> 12:46.104
with a minimum of violence.

12:46.270 --> 12:48.606
Yeah, thanks for hauling away that junk.

12:48.690 --> 12:50.066
Drop by anytime.

12:50.233 --> 12:53.862
Thank you, O great King.
I will be eternally grateful.

12:54.654 --> 12:57.115
Yeah, don't mention it.

12:59.534 --> 13:01.244
Man, you smell weird.

13:01.327 --> 13:03.412
Do all topsiders smell like cheese?

13:03.621 --> 13:05.414
No, just Jack.

13:08.292 --> 13:11.254
Thank you again,
noble King of the Mole People.

13:11.337 --> 13:14.674
May our lands coexist in peace,
and may you prosper...

13:14.757 --> 13:16.801
I am being hauled.
Farewell!

13:22.182 --> 13:23.683
This has been a fun day.

13:25.518 --> 13:27.395
That cat hit me in the head.

13:38.447 --> 13:39.490
How did it go?

13:39.615 --> 13:41.826
It went... like this!

13:41.910 --> 13:43.870
Wow!

13:44.120 --> 13:46.539
We can fix the town twice over.

13:46.748 --> 13:47.999
Buy the orphans new clothes.

13:48.083 --> 13:49.209
<i>Hooray!</i>

13:49.292 --> 13:51.044
<i>And send them to a fancy school.</i>

13:51.753 --> 13:52.795
Nuh-uh.
- No way!

13:52.879 --> 13:54.005
No.

13:54.214 --> 13:57.425
Or not send them to a fancy school
because they will be so rich,

13:57.508 --> 13:58.843
they won't have to know things!

13:59.010 --> 14:03.472
I can hire servants
to know things for me.

14:04.473 --> 14:05.808
Yay!

14:05.892 --> 14:07.476
I'm forgetting stuff already!

14:07.685 --> 14:09.229
What's a seven?

14:10.772 --> 14:11.856
And most importantly,

14:12.065 --> 14:15.068
there was none of the usual trouble
that Jack brings.

14:15.944 --> 14:17.403
I do not bring...

14:17.862 --> 14:19.072
Oh, yes I do.

14:19.155 --> 14:21.866
Jack, you may be a coward and a liar,

14:21.991 --> 14:24.286
but you have done well.
Thank you.

14:24.368 --> 14:28.039
Oh, please,
do not mention it.

14:30.875 --> 14:33.377
And now I must go.

14:33.461 --> 14:35.379
Goodbye, San... Ow!

14:35.463 --> 14:36.298
Adieu.

14:37.924 --> 14:39.425
Adios, Jack!

14:41.844 --> 14:44.472
You see?
He's not such a bad fellow.

14:44.555 --> 14:45.932
I don't know,

14:46.015 --> 14:49.018
it seemed like he was
in an awfully big hurry to leave.

14:50.186 --> 14:52.480
You have a suspicious mind,
you know that?

14:52.563 --> 14:55.317
I am sure Jack did nothing wrong.

14:55.399 --> 14:56.818
<i>Thieves!</i>

15:10.748 --> 15:13.168
Things may have taken a slight turn.

15:17.546 --> 15:18.506
A little help.

15:21.968 --> 15:23.219
<i>Aw, come on.</i>

15:27.556 --> 15:30.143
Okay, where...
What was I doing?

15:30.226 --> 15:31.769
Okay, yeah.
Where am I?

15:33.813 --> 15:35.315
Make it stop, make it stop!

15:35.398 --> 15:36.399
Oh, okay, better.

15:36.482 --> 15:38.151
All right, back to business.

15:38.818 --> 15:40.653
You took my bally!

15:46.784 --> 15:49.078
Wreck it.
Wreck everything.

15:49.662 --> 15:50.955
Mole King, stop it!

15:51.122 --> 15:51.998
What is going on?

15:52.207 --> 15:54.583
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.878
My precious bally.
You stole it!

15:57.045 --> 15:59.005
I assure you I did not.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.131
Call off your guards!

16:01.090 --> 16:02.050
Hold it.

16:03.051 --> 16:05.178
If you didn't take it,
who did?

16:07.555 --> 16:08.556
Jack.

16:10.058 --> 16:11.934
<i>Jack!</i>

16:12.101 --> 16:12.935
Uh-oh.

16:15.146 --> 16:18.524
Please, Your Majesty.
It was Jack who took your... bally.

16:18.607 --> 16:21.194
I will get it back.
Just do not hurt the town!

16:21.819 --> 16:23.405
Okay, all right.

16:23.487 --> 16:26.282
Bring me back my bally
and I'll spare your town.

16:26.449 --> 16:28.826
I will do so.

16:29.660 --> 16:31.662
I will make Jack regret betraying me.

16:31.746 --> 16:33.122
Hyah!

16:33.331 --> 16:36.167
Ugh. This is like the third time
Jack has betrayed him

16:36.251 --> 16:38.002
and Puss never makes him regret it.

16:38.086 --> 16:40.338
Guy needs to work on his boundaries.

16:40.422 --> 16:42.965
What is that?

16:44.300 --> 16:45.927
You mean, the sky?

16:46.052 --> 16:48.430
I feel like I'm gonna fall into it.

16:48.512 --> 16:49.431
Hold me.

16:52.016 --> 16:53.601
What are those white things?

16:53.684 --> 16:54.852
Just clouds.

16:54.936 --> 16:56.145
Are they gonna crush me?

16:58.022 --> 17:00.442
What's happening?
- Cloud hiccups.

17:01.567 --> 17:04.112
This is a nightmare!

17:10.117 --> 17:11.035
<i>Jack Sprat!</i>

17:11.118 --> 17:11.993
Whoa!

17:15.039 --> 17:16.499
You, Big Ears.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.666
What?
- Huh?

17:19.627 --> 17:22.713
All of you,
I have a sack of jewels here,

17:22.797 --> 17:25.840
and I will pay you to protect me
from Puss in Boots!

17:28.719 --> 17:31.889
You want to pay us to fight Puss?
- Yes.

17:32.140 --> 17:33.182
Let's see.

17:33.266 --> 17:36.144
We could fight Puss,
who we are all afraid of.

17:36.227 --> 17:37.645
Mm-hm.
- That's right.

17:37.728 --> 17:40.523
Or we could just fight you
and take your jewels.

17:42.233 --> 17:43.567
Get him!

18:06.590 --> 18:08.801
Oh, Puss, you saved...

18:12.721 --> 18:14.557
When you regain consciousness, Jack,

18:14.640 --> 18:17.768
we are going to have a discussion
about this friendship.

18:18.686 --> 18:21.564
You guys have just been
living up here this whole time?

18:21.772 --> 18:23.107
That is bizarre.

18:24.108 --> 18:25.943
How do you get food down there?

18:26.027 --> 18:27.320
We have root farms

18:27.403 --> 18:29.071
and we raise bats for milk.

18:29.613 --> 18:31.366
Oh, you drink bat milk?

18:31.907 --> 18:34.202
Sure.
Where do you get milk from?

18:36.912 --> 18:37.955
Oh!

18:38.039 --> 18:40.583
Oh, my gosh,
that's so weird.

18:40.666 --> 18:43.503
Your Majesty,
I have returned with your ball.

18:46.214 --> 18:48.216
Oh, Bally!

18:52.053 --> 18:54.805
It is broken!

18:56.474 --> 18:59.227
Guards, destroy this town!

19:02.646 --> 19:05.149
Please, do not do this.
We are friends.

19:06.234 --> 19:07.818
I never met you before.

19:08.027 --> 19:10.863
I am so sorry,
you all look alike to me.

19:10.946 --> 19:13.575
Hey, Carl.
He thinks we all look alike.

19:13.657 --> 19:15.076
I'm Steve.

19:18.746 --> 19:20.748
Oh!

19:27.171 --> 19:30.425
<i>Did you know that
mole people are chasing us?</i>

19:33.553 --> 19:35.179
Excuse me, Your Majesty?

19:35.263 --> 19:37.723
Why is that ball so important to you?

19:37.806 --> 19:39.350
Because of the show.

19:39.434 --> 19:41.436
I like to watch the show.

19:41.519 --> 19:42.770
The what?

19:42.853 --> 19:44.355
There's a show in the ball.

19:45.940 --> 19:46.774
Oh.

19:46.857 --> 19:49.068
It's all about a handsome
mole king like me

19:49.151 --> 19:50.819
who does all the stuff I do.

19:53.072 --> 19:56.200
But now it's broken
and I can't see it!

19:58.286 --> 19:59.203
Hm.

20:01.581 --> 20:03.958
I think I may be able to fix it.

20:14.176 --> 20:15.344
<i>Ah-ha!</i>

20:16.512 --> 20:17.513
Ow!

20:32.861 --> 20:33.821
Hey!

20:37.659 --> 20:38.660
Huh?

20:38.742 --> 20:39.785
Run!

20:50.713 --> 20:52.173
I am sorry, Kid Pickles.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.467
I regret nothing!

20:56.969 --> 20:57.970
Try it now.

21:02.350 --> 21:03.518
Aw, it's fixed.

21:03.892 --> 21:05.561
Hey, it's fixed!

21:06.729 --> 21:08.189
Stop everything!

21:09.815 --> 21:12.776
Oh, my gosh, the reception
is even better now.

21:12.860 --> 21:14.945
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you!

21:16.113 --> 21:17.406
My Liege, what should we...

21:17.490 --> 21:18.824
Zip it, zip it, zip it.

21:18.907 --> 21:20.743
It's on.
Everybody go back.

21:20.826 --> 21:23.663
This is a good one,
I don't want to miss it. Go, go, go!

21:26.874 --> 21:31.462
Milady, you are welcome in
the Kingdom of the Mole People anytime.

21:32.046 --> 21:34.048
You, not so much.

21:35.924 --> 21:41.263
And you are a very bad person!

21:42.931 --> 21:44.308
So long, topsiders.

21:44.808 --> 21:47.102
Have fun drinking your friend's milk.

21:47.687 --> 21:49.063
So weird.

21:52.775 --> 21:53.984
It's milk.

21:54.068 --> 21:57.739
It's friend's milk.
It's just, I don't get it.

21:57.821 --> 21:59.741
The orphans' garden is a mess.

21:59.823 --> 22:01.617
We have to fill this hole in.

22:01.701 --> 22:04.286
Yes, someone should do that.

22:11.627 --> 22:14.088
I do not like the manual labor.

22:14.171 --> 22:16.965
Do I really have to do this
all by myself?

22:17.049 --> 22:20.636
Ow!
- Yes, you really do.

22:20.720 --> 22:24.223
Oh, and with the damage those
mole people caused, it's going

22:24.224 --> 22:27.727
to take all the jewels to fix
the town now. Including yours.

22:28.561 --> 22:31.105
<i>No!</i>

22:31.188 --> 22:33.733
Such a lovely sound.
