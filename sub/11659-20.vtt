00:55.533 --> 00:57.533
Hi, Sophia, how are you this morning?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.633
My joints ache, my ears are ringing,

00:59.700 --> 01:03.333
my butt dropped 2 inches
coming down the hall.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.166
All in all, not bad.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.066
Want breakfast?

01:09.133 --> 01:11.200
Not if you're making it.

01:11.266 --> 01:14.066
Oh, come on.
It's an old family favorite,

01:14.133 --> 01:16.433
chocolate chip pancakes.

01:18.033 --> 01:20.266
Made with brown sugar,
honey, whipped cream,

01:20.333 --> 01:22.133
and maple syrup.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.500
If God meant man to eat like that,

01:25.567 --> 01:28.367
he would have supplied teeth in a baggie.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.834
Well, excuse me for asking.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.734
I'm sorry. I'm just irritable.

01:33.800 --> 01:38.066
Are you still upset
because Bernice moved back to Chicago?

01:38.133 --> 01:42.166
No, Rose. I'm upset because
I can't relate to<i> Thirtysomething.</i>

01:43.600 --> 01:45.700
Of course that's why I'm upset.

01:45.767 --> 01:49.000
I know. It's hard losing
your best buddy.

01:49.066 --> 01:50.500
You're telling me.

01:50.567 --> 01:52.000
Good morning, Sophia.

01:52.066 --> 01:54.567
Rose, there's no time to eat.

01:54.633 --> 01:58.433
As my campaign manager,
you must spend every waking hour

01:58.500 --> 01:59.967
ensuring my victory,

02:00.033 --> 02:02.633
so, once in office,
I'll implement the changes

02:02.700 --> 02:04.934
needed to move forward
in the grand tradition

02:05.000 --> 02:07.500
of our country's founders.

02:07.567 --> 02:09.367
What office, Blanche?

02:09.433 --> 02:12.567
Fashion show chairman
of the Tinkerbelles.

02:14.266 --> 02:17.834
Morning, everybody.
Rose, I borrowed your golf glove.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.500
I've a date to play.

02:19.567 --> 02:20.767
With a man?

02:20.834 --> 02:23.100
No. With a venus flytrap.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.133
Yes, a man.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.567
Raymond again?

02:27.633 --> 02:28.967
In fact, yes.

02:29.033 --> 02:32.433
Didn't you pick him up
at the grocery store?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.166
I did not pick him up.

02:34.233 --> 02:37.266
He asked me to recommend
a good coffee.

02:37.333 --> 02:40.567
Then I threw myself
underneath his shopping cart.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.600
He sounds really nice.

02:44.667 --> 02:47.967
We've been having
a wonderful time together.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.700
Girls, I really like him.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.333
I think he likes me.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.533
Don't ruin it and sleep with him.

02:55.633 --> 03:00.700
No, ma. I only do that with men
I plan to scar psychologically.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.100
Oh, by the way,
this came for you.

03:06.166 --> 03:08.467
-A postcard from Bernice.
-I don't want it.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.200
Don't you miss her?

03:10.266 --> 03:12.900
If I read that, I'll miss her more.

03:12.967 --> 03:17.467
I know you miss Bernice,
but it's been over a month.

03:17.533 --> 03:21.567
The whole gang is gone.
Gladys is with her daughter.

03:21.633 --> 03:24.767
Eddy got married. Alice died.

03:24.834 --> 03:28.300
Lillian is around,
but she thinks she's Pinky Lee.

03:28.367 --> 03:29.800
I'm the last one.

03:29.867 --> 03:33.233
Maybe it's time
you made new friends.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.467
It's not that easy.

03:35.533 --> 03:39.233
It sure wasn't for the first Eskimo family
that moved to St. Olaf.

03:46.367 --> 03:49.600
Especially after they sawed a hole
and went salmon fishing

03:49.667 --> 03:51.467
in the middle
of the local ice skating rink.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.300
And then there was the Halloween
they gave all the kids whale blubber.

03:58.367 --> 04:01.667
And the time they borrowed
every ice tray in town

04:01.734 --> 04:04.233
to build an addition
over their garage.

04:06.533 --> 04:07.900
What was the point, Rose?

04:08.367 --> 04:11.133
I guess after the baby came,
they needed more room.

04:13.734 --> 04:15.467
The point of the story?

04:15.533 --> 04:18.767
Well, gradually they
were able to make friends

04:18.834 --> 04:21.500
and ended up the most
popular family in town.

04:21.567 --> 04:25.100
But only because they met people.
Right, Rose?

04:25.166 --> 04:28.400
No. In the drought of '49,
their house melted

04:28.467 --> 04:31.300
and kept the town from dehydrating.

04:36.967 --> 04:40.533
Ma, why not play golf
with Raymond and me?

04:40.600 --> 04:45.633
I would love to,
but I don't own any ugly, plaid polyester.

04:45.700 --> 04:48.633
Rose, you have something in a size 6?

04:48.700 --> 04:51.400
I'll help you pick something out.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.200
(doorbell rings)

04:55.266 --> 04:56.533
Must be Raymond.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.934
I'll be right out. I'm getting some
hard candy and my doughnut pillow.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.533
-Hi, Dorothy.
-Come right in.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.934
I have something to tell you.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.967
-Aw, you shouldn't have.
-I know.

05:19.967 --> 05:23.500
-Shouldn't have done that, either.
-Yes, you should. Do it again.

05:25.967 --> 05:27.300
Hey, hey, hey!

05:27.367 --> 05:30.934
I have a Chiclet
if you're fighting over gum.

05:31.934 --> 05:34.867
Hi, Sophia.
I didn't notice you there.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.767
I noticed your hands
all over my daughter.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.567
Do you hear
your daughter complaining?

05:40.633 --> 05:42.600
I apologize, Sophia.

05:42.667 --> 05:45.367
Apology accepted. Let's go.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.700
That's what I wanted to talk about.

05:48.767 --> 05:53.166
Ma's been down lately,
so I invited her to play golf with us.

05:53.233 --> 05:55.033
Oh, wonderful.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.333
-Glad to have you along, Sophia.
-I know.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.600
Have you played much?

06:00.667 --> 06:03.433
Have I played? Have I played?

06:04.133 --> 06:05.433
Have I played what?

06:13.633 --> 06:15.734
Have you finished writing

06:15.800 --> 06:17.333
-my campaign speech?
-Check.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.467
-Sent out the party invitations?
-Check.

06:19.533 --> 06:21.667
Made the refreshment
committee appointment?

06:21.734 --> 06:23.734
-Check.
-Good.

06:24.433 --> 06:29.400
With all the work I've done,
I should run for chairman myself.

06:29.467 --> 06:31.900
(laughs)

06:33.800 --> 06:35.433
What's so funny?

06:35.500 --> 06:40.233
You? Rose, you can't be
fashion show chairman.

06:40.300 --> 06:44.433
You thought Giorgio Armani
was a puppet on<i> Ed Sullivan.</i>

06:46.166 --> 06:48.900
You think I'm not smart enough?

06:48.967 --> 06:52.934
I think you're smart enough.
You just have no taste.

06:54.433 --> 06:58.333
Which goes better, the silver chain
or the pearls?

06:58.400 --> 07:01.166
-The chain.
-An amateur's mistake.

07:01.633 --> 07:05.400
Can't you see the chain
accentuates the many folds

07:05.467 --> 07:07.800
of that turkey-like neck?

07:13.367 --> 07:16.100
That may be,
but the pearls draw attention

07:16.166 --> 07:17.734
to the nonexistent bosom.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.333
Yes, but the chain
leads the eye even lower

07:27.400 --> 07:29.700
to that huge spare tire

07:31.200 --> 07:34.700
jutting out over those
square, manly hips.

07:34.767 --> 07:39.200
Why don't I just wear a sign
that says, "too ugly to live"?

07:40.900 --> 07:44.033
Fine. What are you going to hang it from,
the chain or the pearls?

07:45.567 --> 07:48.934
Neither.
I'm going to spray-paint it on my hump.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.433
See, Blanche?
You don't know any more than I do.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.967
I'm running for show chairman.

07:56.033 --> 08:00.867
Who on the committee will vote for you?
I'm going to win.

08:00.934 --> 08:05.000
How is that possible?
Everybody on the committee is female.

08:05.066 --> 08:07.500
Who are you going to sleep with?

08:12.834 --> 08:17.100
Are you insinuating
that I cannot win it on merit alone?

08:17.166 --> 08:18.800
All women?

08:20.166 --> 08:22.233
Where are you going?

08:22.300 --> 08:25.033
Raymond invited me out
for an intimate dinner.

08:25.100 --> 08:28.633
It's the first time
in weeks without ma.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.033
Is that why you sent her
to the drugstore?

08:31.100 --> 08:32.133
(laughs)

08:32.200 --> 08:33.867
You're dumping your own mother?

08:33.934 --> 08:36.900
Faster than CBS
dumped Jimmy The Greek.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.800
Dorothy, I'm shocked at your behavior.

08:42.867 --> 08:45.233
I'd have done it on the first date.

08:45.300 --> 08:50.233
I felt terrible about doing it,
but Raymond and I need privacy.

08:50.300 --> 08:54.500
-Tell Sophia how you feel.
-Oh, it'll hurt her feelings.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.834
Right now, we're her only friends.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.166
I think that's sweet.

08:58.233 --> 09:02.000
I think it's unnatural,
and I'm from the south.

09:02.567 --> 09:06.033
What do you do
when you and Raymond want to...

09:06.100 --> 09:07.934
you know, make love?

09:08.000 --> 09:08.867
Blanche!

09:08.934 --> 09:10.934
Well, it's bound to come up.

09:11.533 --> 09:15.367
-How do you handle it?
-Yeah, Dorothy.

09:16.834 --> 09:19.500
Handle it?
I can't even get close to it.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.367
(doorbell rings)

09:26.900 --> 09:29.967
-Is it safe?
-Ma's out. Make it quick.

09:30.033 --> 09:32.734
-Hi.
-Okay. Let's go.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.734
I feel terrible
about running out on ma.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.266
I don't.

09:41.333 --> 09:44.133
Hey, hey!
Give it a rest, Raymond.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.800
You're in her mouth
more than her dentist.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.934
How did you get back so soon?

09:51.000 --> 09:55.166
I faked a heart attack
to get through the line.

09:55.233 --> 09:58.200
We were just going out to dinner.

09:58.266 --> 10:00.033
Great. Where are we going?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.934
Well, Sophia, to tell you the truth,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.400
we thought maybe just this once--

10:04.467 --> 10:08.433
We thought we'd have French food.
How's that?

10:08.500 --> 10:13.367
They eat snails. Why pay money for
something you can scrape off your shoes?

10:14.033 --> 10:17.567
If you'd rather not come, we understand.

10:17.633 --> 10:20.500
Don't worry about that.
I'll find something on the menu.

10:20.567 --> 10:23.200
I just enjoy being out with you guys.

10:24.166 --> 10:28.233
Dorothy.
I'm tired of dating your mother.

10:28.300 --> 10:31.700
I promise
it's the last time this will happen.

10:31.767 --> 10:32.533
Okay.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.233
-Coming, ma.
-Uh, just one more thing.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.300
What is it?

10:36.367 --> 10:39.533
When we're through eating
and she picks her teeth--

10:39.600 --> 10:42.900
I'll make her keep them in her mouth.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.900
This is really lovely, Raymond.

10:52.967 --> 10:54.767
I'd hope you'd like it.

10:54.834 --> 10:57.433
It reminds of the place
I met Charles de Gaulle.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.767
-We were lovers, you know.
-Really?

11:01.834 --> 11:03.233
Ma, that's a lie.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.900
Who asked you?

11:05.800 --> 11:10.300
Picture it. Sicily, 1921.

11:10.367 --> 11:13.266
A beautiful young peasant girl
saves her lira

11:13.333 --> 11:16.633
and takes a trip to Paris,
the city of lights.

11:16.700 --> 11:20.834
Also the only place a guy can wear a cap
without getting funny looks.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.300
She wanders into a restaurant

11:24.367 --> 11:27.667
and ends up sharing a table
with a dashing young Frenchman.

11:27.734 --> 11:31.734
They drink, they talk, they burn a cork,
and draw moustaches on each other.

11:31.800 --> 11:32.967
What?

11:33.033 --> 11:34.700
Just wanted to see if you were listening.

11:36.133 --> 11:42.200
The next thing she knows
it's hours later, the place is empty

11:42.266 --> 11:45.834
and the Frenchman has his schnauz
down her blouse.

11:47.266 --> 11:50.133
This begins a beautiful love affair.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.667
Kids, I was that peasant girl.

11:53.734 --> 11:56.400
And the schnauz was Charles the Mole.

11:57.567 --> 11:59.367
Charles the Mole?

11:59.433 --> 12:01.834
Yeah, Charles the Mole.

12:01.900 --> 12:05.033
He was the wheel man
for Louie the Ice Pick.

12:07.633 --> 12:10.300
Ma, you said Charles de Gaulle.

12:10.367 --> 12:12.133
Yeah, right.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.000
I slept with Charles de Gaulle.

12:14.066 --> 12:18.433
I could have been the First Lady of France
but I married your father instead.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.300
A man who cleans his toenails
with a shrimp fork.

12:23.900 --> 12:27.667
(music playing)

12:27.734 --> 12:28.667
Hey, hey, hey.

12:28.734 --> 12:29.667
(music stops)

12:29.734 --> 12:30.900
Move it along, would you.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.400
We're trying to have
a conversation here.

12:36.333 --> 12:37.934
May I get you something from the bar?

12:38.000 --> 12:41.033
Yes, bring me a bottle of scotch.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.667
Raymond,
we still have to get through dinner.

12:43.734 --> 12:46.433
That's right. And a bottle of gin.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.834
Dinner was just wonderful, Raymond.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.367
The rolls were the best I ever tasted.

12:59.867 --> 13:01.200
You want one?

13:04.367 --> 13:06.066
No, thank you, Sophia.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.333
How about some coffee?

13:07.400 --> 13:10.400
I didn't steal any,
but I have plenty of matches.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.533
We'll make some.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.233
Good idea. I'll put some on.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.200
Dorothy, I have to tell you--

13:20.266 --> 13:23.900
not being alone with you
is driving me crazy.

13:23.967 --> 13:25.800
Oh, I know. Me too.

13:25.867 --> 13:29.333
Why don't we go away for a few days?

13:29.400 --> 13:30.467
Yes.

13:30.533 --> 13:33.266
How about going to the Bahamas?

13:33.333 --> 13:35.867
All right!

13:35.934 --> 13:38.200
Fantastic.

13:42.033 --> 13:43.500
I gotta tell you.

13:43.567 --> 13:46.033
Being with you guys
these last few weeks

13:46.100 --> 13:48.200
is the most fun I've had in years.

13:48.266 --> 13:52.800
You really made me forget my loneliness,
thanks.

13:52.867 --> 13:56.767
I can't believe it,
I'm going to the Bahamas.

13:56.834 --> 14:00.367
<i>♪ Jay-o, jay-o ♪</i>

14:04.333 --> 14:07.400
Trust me, Raymond,
there is no way ma is going with us

14:07.467 --> 14:09.300
to the Bahamas. I promise.

14:09.367 --> 14:12.367
-I promise I'll tell her.
-I hope you will.

14:12.967 --> 14:16.633
You've been so understanding about ma.
I appreciate it.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.133
It's okay. I respect you being

14:19.200 --> 14:21.166
-so considerate of your mother.
-Thank you.

14:21.233 --> 14:24.767
Have you ever considered
having her put away?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.633
Every day of my life.

14:40.633 --> 14:44.033
-Dorothy, why are you up?
-Uh, just thinking.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.000
About what?

14:45.066 --> 14:48.433
About telling ma
she's not invited to the Bahamas.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.567
What are you doing up?

14:52.600 --> 14:57.266
Can I confide something in you
I've never told another soul?

14:57.333 --> 14:58.533
Of course.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.867
-You won't tell anybody?
-I promise.

15:00.934 --> 15:04.834
Are you willing to spit in your hand
and rub on it?

15:05.734 --> 15:08.500
Who are we, Wally and The Beaver?

15:09.500 --> 15:11.834
What is it you want to tell me?

15:12.700 --> 15:17.400
I'm not absolutely sure I'm the most
qualified Tinkerbelle to win the election.

15:17.467 --> 15:19.834
Of course you are.

15:19.900 --> 15:23.800
Why, you're the best damn Tinkerbelle
I know.

15:25.734 --> 15:29.200
-Uh, I just had the most disturbing dream.
-What was it?

15:29.266 --> 15:33.767
I was stranded on an island
with Tom Selleck, Ted Danson,

15:33.834 --> 15:35.734
and Steve Guttenberg.

15:36.467 --> 15:39.200
Three men and, oh, baby!

15:39.266 --> 15:41.734
They kept passing me around
and kissing me

15:41.800 --> 15:43.867
and powdering my behind.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.100
Um, so, what was so disturbing?

15:47.166 --> 15:52.233
Well, I woke up
and I'd only slept with Steve Guttenberg.

15:54.467 --> 15:57.467
And I'm not even sure who he is.

15:59.233 --> 16:00.834
Why are you up?

16:00.900 --> 16:04.767
-I just couldn't sleep.
-Me, neither. I'm worried about ma.

16:05.233 --> 16:09.500
Oh, I guess she didn't take the news well
about the Bahamas.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.567
Dorothy still hasn't told her.

16:11.633 --> 16:15.300
Oh, honey, it's been days,
what are you waiting for?

16:15.367 --> 16:19.200
She's so thrilled.
How can I tell her she's not invited?

16:19.266 --> 16:20.266
I'm not going.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.700
-I think that's wrong.
-Me too.

16:23.767 --> 16:27.400
Besides, spending time with Sophia
isn't really helping her.

16:27.467 --> 16:29.900
She should meet her own friends.

16:29.967 --> 16:32.033
I'm not going. She needs me.

16:32.100 --> 16:35.233
Please give this some thought.

16:35.300 --> 16:39.233
Raymond is such a great guy.
He's been very reasonable.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.233
He's the only man
who hasn't dumped you

16:41.300 --> 16:43.734
after the first date in months.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.433
Years.

16:48.166 --> 16:51.467
Look, I agree with everything
you're trying to say,

16:51.533 --> 16:54.967
but it isn't that simple.
She's my mother.

16:55.033 --> 16:56.934
Right now she needs me.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.433
Just tell her how you feel?
She'll understand.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.600
-You honestly think so?
-Sonia did.

17:04.734 --> 17:08.266
She certainly did.
Thanks for pointing that out.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.800
Good night.

17:10.600 --> 17:13.433
-You know Sonia Klingenhoffer?
-Know her?

17:13.500 --> 17:16.467
She's from St. Olaf, isn't she?
Lovely woman.

17:16.533 --> 17:20.333
Wait a minute.
Sonia's not a woman.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.433
I know. She's a cow.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.967
A pig? A duck? A horse?

17:27.033 --> 17:28.367
A pencil sharpener?

17:28.433 --> 17:30.700
Blanche, jump in. I'm drowning.

17:32.033 --> 17:34.633
Sonia Klingenhoffer is a comic strip.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.633
And a darn good one, too.
Well, good night.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.700
Both of you come back here,

17:40.767 --> 17:44.533
or I'll be forced to follow you
and act it out with sock puppets.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.000
You were saying?

17:51.700 --> 17:55.800
In the first panel, it says
"Sonia Klingenhoffer" in big letters.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.033
And the "O" has pigtails.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.867
What's in the second panel?

17:59.934 --> 18:04.800
Sonia's walking down this country road,
and there's some children laughing at her.

18:04.867 --> 18:08.633
The bubble from her mouth says,
"It's not funny.

18:08.700 --> 18:12.266
Try getting bread and mayonnaise
out of your braces."

18:12.333 --> 18:13.934
And then--

18:14.000 --> 18:16.734
Rose, how many panels are there?

18:16.800 --> 18:19.400
Sixteen. And then--

18:20.533 --> 18:23.233
Could you just tell us
the gist of the story?

18:23.300 --> 18:25.467
Oh, fine, but you'd miss the joke

18:25.533 --> 18:28.233
between the two crows
on the telephone wire.

18:29.367 --> 18:31.967
The gist of the story, Rose.

18:33.467 --> 18:35.333
In the last panel,

18:35.400 --> 18:39.200
Sonia tells her mother
and her mother understands.

18:46.934 --> 18:50.467
If my foot wasn't asleep,
I wouldn't ask this.

18:50.934 --> 18:53.433
What exactly was it
Sonia told her mama?

18:53.500 --> 18:57.600
The joke between the crows.
You have to hear it.

18:57.667 --> 18:59.900
-That's it. Get out!
-But--

18:59.967 --> 19:01.567
Get out!

19:04.100 --> 19:07.900
-(Sophia) Aah!
-Sophia, are you all right?

19:07.967 --> 19:12.100
Wonderful, wonderful.
I always wanted a nose like Joe Frazier.

19:12.166 --> 19:14.633
Were you listening at the door?

19:14.700 --> 19:16.533
I wasn't listening.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.033
Why was your face pressed
against the crack?

19:19.100 --> 19:22.200
-That's what the crow said!
-Get out!

19:33.300 --> 19:34.533
(knock on door)

19:34.600 --> 19:36.433
-(Dorothy) Ma, it's me.
-Come in.

19:39.867 --> 19:41.533
Let's talk about the trip.

19:41.600 --> 19:45.467
Yeah. I want to, too.
I'm not going.

19:45.533 --> 19:46.633
What?

19:46.700 --> 19:49.600
You were right about me
making new friends,

19:49.667 --> 19:51.934
so I took your advice.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.333
I met some nice people at the center.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.800
This weekend we're going to Cancun.

19:57.467 --> 20:01.000
You and what's-his-name
will have to go without me.

20:01.066 --> 20:04.667
You just met them,
and you're going to Cancun?

20:04.734 --> 20:07.300
One of them has a condo.

20:07.367 --> 20:10.667
You were listening at the door,
weren't you?

20:10.734 --> 20:15.900
No, I swear on your father's grave
or what used to be your father's grave.

20:15.967 --> 20:18.533
Now it's a Weinerschnitzel.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.000
He always liked pups,
so I never complained.

20:22.133 --> 20:24.767
I know what you're doing,
and it's not working.

20:24.834 --> 20:27.400
-What?
-You created something to do

20:27.467 --> 20:30.133
so you wouldn't intrude.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.133
You don't have to worry about that.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.166
Honey, you're more important.

20:34.633 --> 20:38.667
That's why I'm spending
the entire weekend here with you.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.166
Jeez, you're a yutz.

20:43.266 --> 20:45.400
Try not to get all choked up.

20:46.200 --> 20:51.400
I appreciate what you did for me,
but I got my own plans.

20:51.467 --> 20:55.133
Okay, ma. Whatever you say.

20:56.100 --> 20:59.867
(gloomy music playing)

21:08.533 --> 21:10.734
Dorothy, isn't there anything I can say

21:10.800 --> 21:12.800
that will make you change your
mind and come with me.

21:13.433 --> 21:15.033
I'm afraid not.

21:15.834 --> 21:18.000
Look at the brochure again.

21:18.066 --> 21:21.500
Honestly, Raymond.
If I went to the Bahamas,

21:21.567 --> 21:24.700
I'd spend the entire time
worrying about my mother.

21:24.767 --> 21:28.834
"Frolicking gaily on white beaches."

21:29.500 --> 21:32.800
"Dancing cheek to cheek
under starry skies."

21:32.867 --> 21:38.166
"And sharing romantic interludes
to the sound of the pounding waves."

21:38.233 --> 21:41.633
Oh, God, I hate that wretched old woman.

21:42.633 --> 21:45.467
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Raymond, I just can't.

21:45.533 --> 21:47.133
My mother needs me here.

21:47.834 --> 21:50.266
Dorothy,
you're one hell of a daughter,

21:50.333 --> 21:53.266
but also a lousy girlfriend.

21:53.333 --> 21:54.400
Sorry.

21:54.467 --> 21:58.867
The best thing for us
is not to see each other a while,

21:59.667 --> 22:02.934
at least until your mother
doesn't need your time.

22:03.967 --> 22:05.266
Maybe you're right.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.367
-I'll call in a few weeks.
-Okay.

22:12.667 --> 22:13.900
Raymond.

22:26.934 --> 22:28.066
Hi, Dorothy.

22:28.133 --> 22:30.800
-How did the election go?
-Don't ask.

22:30.867 --> 22:33.900
We both lost by a landslide.

22:33.967 --> 22:37.133
You're kidding. Who won?

22:37.200 --> 22:40.500
Fifi Boger. Can you believe that?

22:40.567 --> 22:44.000
I think it's because
her husband's a plastic surgeon.

22:44.066 --> 22:46.100
Why would that matter?

22:46.166 --> 22:49.166
She promised everyone
a discount on liposuction.

22:49.233 --> 22:51.633
Two cheeks for the price of one.

22:54.266 --> 22:57.200
That's what swung it for Nixon in '68.

22:58.633 --> 23:01.667
I thought you'd be in Cancun by now.

23:01.734 --> 23:06.333
Someone was supposed to pick me up.
I don't know what's taking them so long.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.533
When are you going to stop?

23:08.600 --> 23:12.667
You're not going anywhere,
so put down your suitcase,

23:12.734 --> 23:14.800
and we'll see a movie.

23:14.867 --> 23:16.166
You go to a movie.

23:16.233 --> 23:22.900
Soon I'll be basking on a white beach
trying to keep sand out of my wrinkles.

23:22.967 --> 23:24.500
(doorbell rings)

23:24.567 --> 23:25.934
I'll get it.

23:27.700 --> 23:30.500
-Hello there.
-Is Sophia home?

23:30.567 --> 23:33.333
-Hi, Duncan.
-(Duncan) Hi, Sophia.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.600
The gang's in the car.
I'll take your suitcase.

23:36.667 --> 23:40.633
Ma, you're really going, aren't you?

23:40.700 --> 23:42.867
I tried to tell you.

23:42.934 --> 23:46.233
I thought you were lonely.
You needed me.

23:46.300 --> 23:49.600
I did, and you were there,
just like always.

23:49.667 --> 23:51.734
I love you, pussycat,

23:51.800 --> 23:54.834
but, hey, I got my own life. <i>Adios.</i>

24:04.266 --> 24:08.767
(theme music playing)
