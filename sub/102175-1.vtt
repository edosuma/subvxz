19:00.269 --> 19:02.444
Yeah, you can scream
as much as you'd like,

19:02.531 --> 19:04.578
'cause the room is soundproof.

19:05.926 --> 19:10.018
[grunting]
Dad, get off!

19:10.060 --> 19:13.847
Dad, let go! Let go!

19:13.934 --> 19:15.675
[grunts]
Ah!

19:22.596 --> 19:24.205
You can't do this to me.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.251
Yes, I can.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.212
I can't breathe. There's no air.

19:30.255 --> 19:34.564
As long as there's power,
there's air.

19:34.651 --> 19:37.959
Three failed attempts on
the keypad shuts the power off,

19:38.046 --> 19:39.874
which shuts off
the ventilation system.

19:39.961 --> 19:42.832
I change the code every day.

19:42.919 --> 19:45.184
[panting]

19:53.408 --> 19:54.714
Why are you doing this?

19:54.801 --> 19:58.021
Life is a series
of interactions.

19:58.108 --> 20:00.502
Action, reaction.

20:00.589 --> 20:02.940
Choices, consequences.

20:02.983 --> 20:06.770
You chose to be disrespectful,
and this is your consequence.

20:06.813 --> 20:10.470
Help! Someone! Ugh.

20:10.557 --> 20:14.038
This vent
is where you get your air

20:14.081 --> 20:15.997
if I say you do.

20:16.084 --> 20:19.392
You eat when I say you do.

20:19.479 --> 20:23.482
You want a blanket, a book,

20:23.569 --> 20:27.617
you can have those things
if I say you can.

20:27.703 --> 20:32.405
Everything that you get now,
every privilege, you will earn.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.407
You understand?

20:36.321 --> 20:38.933
Do you understand?

20:42.370 --> 20:44.329
Fine.

20:44.416 --> 20:46.896
Ah. Damn.

20:46.983 --> 20:50.901
Huh? Hey! Ow. Ow.

20:51.597 --> 20:53.469
Oh, ow.

22:20.425 --> 22:25.039
Well, it's not like her.
I mean, she still hasn't called.

22:25.126 --> 22:28.085
She promised that she wouldn't
run off like that again.

22:28.128 --> 22:30.348
She broke a lot of promises.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.351
This is my husband, Don.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.309
-Nice to meet you.
-Sir.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.571
Well, she's run off before,
right?

22:36.658 --> 22:37.572
[Don] Yes.
[Irene] No.

22:37.659 --> 22:39.270
It was to a party.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.751
This is different.
She came right back.

22:41.838 --> 22:44.405
Well, she's 18, which means she
can come and go as she pleases.

22:44.492 --> 22:47.757
Isn't it likely that she decided
she needed some space

22:47.800 --> 22:48.975
and is staying with friends?

22:49.062 --> 22:50.978
She doesn't have
that many friends.

22:51.065 --> 22:53.415
I've talked to all the ones
that I know.

22:53.459 --> 22:57.288
-Boyfriend?
-Chris hasn't seen her.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.247
[Amy] And he seems
like a pretty nice guy.

22:59.290 --> 23:01.379
Chris who? You got a number?

23:01.423 --> 23:03.251
Yeah. I'll go get it.

23:04.818 --> 23:07.124
All right. We'll talk to him.

23:07.167 --> 23:08.255
Did you guys notice
anything missing?

23:08.343 --> 23:10.126
Clothes, personal items?

23:10.171 --> 23:13.392
Uh, yes. Some clothes
and a travel bag.

23:14.957 --> 23:18.440
-Did you tell him her plans?
-What plan?

23:18.527 --> 23:20.921
She wants to visit
all 50 states.

23:21.008 --> 23:24.011
Don, it's not really a plan.

23:24.706 --> 23:26.360
She's a dreamer.

23:26.447 --> 23:29.059
And she said
that when she turned 18,

23:29.145 --> 23:31.409
that she was gonna go
from Florida

23:31.453 --> 23:35.108
and work her way
across the country.

23:35.152 --> 23:36.936
But she hasn't had
her birthday yet.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.939
[sobbing] And she wouldn't leave

23:38.982 --> 23:41.157
without saying goodbye to me.

23:41.244 --> 23:43.464
She wouldn't.

23:43.551 --> 23:45.466
We've already filed
a missing person's report.

23:45.511 --> 23:46.685
But without any leads,
that's about all

23:46.772 --> 23:48.949
I can do at this point.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.038
And I've been doing this
for 20 years.

23:51.125 --> 23:54.301
Usually, these situations
resolve themselves.

23:54.345 --> 23:57.783
You'll be sitting at home,
your phone will ring...

23:59.699 --> 24:01.701
And it'll be Sarah.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.093
Yeah.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.096
Well, thank you.

24:09.272 --> 24:11.405

to let you know if she calls.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.983
Well, uh, probably not.

-But I'm gonna get you a helmet.
-Mm.

25:10.857 --> 25:13.076
And then what?

25:13.119 --> 25:15.165
Then we're gonna hit the road.

Yeah. Me rockin' my pink helmet.

25:18.341 --> 25:20.780
And, uh, where are we gonna go?

since, like, first grade.

She always said that she was
gonna run away with him one day,

26:42.949 --> 26:47.606
and right after graduation,
she did.

you're, you're trying to tell me

She was working as a waitress.

anything about Steve?

she-she mentioned Florida.

found out
about Prince Christopher

chopped off his daughter's wings

and he locked her
in a cave underground.

-Calm down, honey.

50:44.127 --> 50:45.912
Hi, baby.

50:51.309 --> 50:53.615
[Sarah] Dear mom.
I hope you're doing okay.

50:53.658 --> 50:55.225
-What? Sarah?
-I'm sorry I haven't called.

50:55.312 --> 50:57.488
-Or written.
-[sighs] You're alive.

50:57.575 --> 50:59.620
[Sarah] I have a boyfriend now,
and we're dong okay,

50:59.664 --> 51:02.493
but there's no time or money
for a baby right now.

51:02.580 --> 51:04.147
-Oh, my God.
-This is Thomas.

51:04.191 --> 51:06.453
I hope you'll take
good care of him for me

51:06.497 --> 51:08.629
until I can come for him.

51:08.673 --> 51:11.937
I love you and miss you. Sarah.

51:14.374 --> 51:17.812
-Come here, my baby.

-[dramatic music]
-Don...

51:20.511 --> 51:23.341
Don, Don...

51:23.428 --> 51:25.865
This is Sarah's baby.

51:25.952 --> 51:27.258
She was here.

51:28.519 --> 51:30.957
-Sarah was here.
-No.

51:33.785 --> 51:35.265
Oh, come on, baby.

Shh...

Shh...

52:09.691 --> 52:10.952
Hey.

52:11.039 --> 52:13.477
-How'd it go?
-Fine.

52:13.564 --> 52:16.437
Just one little hiccup.

52:16.524 --> 52:20.919
"Mom, I'm being held captive
in the basement.

52:21.006 --> 52:22.660
Call the police."

52:23.923 --> 52:26.142
You haven't learned a thing.

52:32.497 --> 52:34.325
Now put this on.

52:42.680 --> 52:45.640
[clock ticking]

52:49.644 --> 52:52.256
[Marie] Once upon a time
there was a little girl

52:52.343 --> 52:54.780
who lived in a dark cave
with her mother,

52:54.867 --> 52:56.825
who was once a fairy princess.

52:56.912 --> 52:59.740
One day a fairy godmother
brought a little boy

52:59.785 --> 53:01.352
for the little girl
to play with.

53:01.394 --> 53:03.223
They loved playing together.

53:03.267 --> 53:05.356
They went
on amazing adventures,

53:05.443 --> 53:09.098
to the rainforest,
the jungle and even the moon,

53:09.185 --> 53:10.752
where they met an alien.

53:10.839 --> 53:13.015
Even though
they argued sometimes,

53:13.102 --> 53:15.278
they were very happy.

53:15.321 --> 53:18.238
Her mother's Prince Charming
was still wandering,

53:18.325 --> 53:20.544
trying to find
his fairy princess.

53:20.631 --> 53:23.504
He sang the special song
he wrote for her,

53:23.591 --> 53:27.508
and never gave up. The little
girl never gave up either.

53:27.595 --> 53:30.423
She knew that one day
she and her mother

53:30.510 --> 53:32.470
and her brother
would be rescued...

53:32.557 --> 53:34.602
[Marie] ...and live
happily ever after.

53:34.689 --> 53:36.908
-[Sarah] Wow!
-[cheering]

53:36.995 --> 53:39.084
Thank you. Thank you.

53:47.093 --> 53:48.093
Ah.

53:49.443 --> 53:51.923
Stop. Stay still.

53:51.966 --> 53:54.055
Let me see. Okay, you're done.

53:54.142 --> 53:55.928
Well, looks cool.

53:55.970 --> 53:57.276
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

[indistinct chatter]

53:59.365 --> 54:01.673
-Ta-da!
-[Michael] Really?

54:01.760 --> 54:03.979
[laughs]
You look like a clown.

54:04.066 --> 54:06.591
-Yeah, says you.
-Hey, what are you doing?

54:06.678 --> 54:08.287
-Make-up.
-[Sarah] No.

54:08.332 --> 54:10.464
You're not wearing make-up.

54:10.551 --> 54:12.073
Come here.

54:16.861 --> 54:20.430
You are very, very beautiful.

54:22.606 --> 54:25.261
Marie. Marie, come here.

54:26.524 --> 54:27.785
Come here.

54:29.352 --> 54:33.095
Hey! Come here, set the table.

54:34.879 --> 54:37.316
Michael, help your sister.

54:37.403 --> 54:39.928
You don't touch her.

54:40.015 --> 54:42.452
Please leave her alone.

54:44.062 --> 54:45.499
Take this with you.

54:45.542 --> 54:47.631
She doesn't need it.
She's just a kid.

-Hey.

55:07.912 --> 55:10.394
Remember to breathe, honey.

55:10.481 --> 55:11.656
[Marie breathing heavily]

55:11.698 --> 55:14.658
What's goin' on?
Will you talk to me?

55:16.921 --> 55:18.662
I don't know anyone.

55:19.881 --> 55:22.709
I don't have any friends.

55:22.754 --> 55:25.930
What if I never meet anyone?

55:26.017 --> 55:28.847
What if I never meet a nice boy?

55:30.674 --> 55:32.024
You will.

55:33.459 --> 55:35.680
-How?
-I'm working on it.

55:35.767 --> 55:37.334
I promise.

55:38.725 --> 55:40.859
You just have to be patient.

55:42.687 --> 55:44.689
How did you meet dad?

55:55.089 --> 55:58.049
I've known your father
almost my whole life.

55:59.921 --> 56:02.575
Well, I think
that when we get out of here,

56:02.620 --> 56:04.709
maybe you should get a divorce.

I think that's rain.

Michael, come help us.

57:14.430 --> 57:17.042
Uh... Well,
will you help me move this?

57:17.129 --> 57:19.131
-This?
-This, yes.

57:26.443 --> 57:29.620
I was just missing
your mama like crazy,

57:29.662 --> 57:31.535
and I just wanted to make sure

57:31.622 --> 57:35.973
that, that everything was
perfect for when she comes home.

get me a spoon?

she's never coming back. Um...

57:56.080 --> 57:58.475
Oh. How does he know?

58:00.301 --> 58:02.303
Your grandpa
doesn't know everything.

God, the ceiling is wet.
It's soft.

58:08.354 --> 58:09.964
What was she like?

58:14.098 --> 58:18.363
She was magnificent.

58:18.406 --> 58:21.845
I mean, she is magnificent.

if you knew or not.

You're welcome.

What's for dinner?

1:02:50.941 --> 1:02:52.464
What's wrong with you?

1:02:54.205 --> 1:02:57.729
Nothing. Everything's fine.

1:02:57.816 --> 1:03:00.645
Well, get that look off your
face. You look just like her.

1:03:00.689 --> 1:03:03.082
-Who?
-Your grandmother.

1:03:03.169 --> 1:03:05.738
She always had this sour look
on her face.

nothing was ever good enough.

You know, I don't have to come
down here if I don't want.

[Sarah] I'm sorry, Don.
I'm just tired.

Oh, you're tired? What from?
From working so hard?

1:03:21.100 --> 1:03:24.147
You don't know
what it's like up there.

1:03:24.234 --> 1:03:26.714
They're laying off people
left and right.

1:03:26.803 --> 1:03:29.718
I'll be lucky to hang on
to my job by Christmas.

1:03:29.805 --> 1:03:30.937
Hm.

1:03:39.946 --> 1:03:41.426
How's Thomas?

1:03:41.513 --> 1:03:44.254
Thomas is doing great.

1:03:44.341 --> 1:03:47.039
He's eating like a wild animal.

1:03:47.084 --> 1:03:49.390
He's getting big,
he's getting strong.

1:03:49.434 --> 1:03:51.392
Next year
he wants to play football

1:03:51.479 --> 1:03:53.089
in addition to baseball.

1:03:53.176 --> 1:03:55.178
I'd like to play someday.

1:03:55.265 --> 1:03:56.919
Well, you certainly
will be able to

1:03:56.963 --> 1:04:00.401
as soon as your mother
learns to behave herself.

1:04:00.444 --> 1:04:01.749
When will that be?

1:04:01.838 --> 1:04:04.274
[Marie] Yeah, when will that be?

1:04:04.361 --> 1:04:08.932
A month? A year? Two years?

1:04:08.975 --> 1:04:12.848
Well, well, I don't know.
It all depends on mom, right?

1:04:17.941 --> 1:04:20.725
Right. He's sorry he asked.

1:04:23.207 --> 1:04:25.861
[Michael]
What's wrong with asking, huh?

1:04:25.948 --> 1:04:27.167
[Marie] Fifteen minutes?
[Sarah] He would have said no.

1:04:27.254 --> 1:04:28.254
How do you know?

-That's true.

1:04:33.999 --> 1:04:35.218
Yeah, I'm trying to protect you,

1:04:35.261 --> 1:04:36.437
and I'm doing the best
that I can!

1:04:36.524 --> 1:04:37.785
This is your fault!

1:04:37.874 --> 1:04:39.439
You are the reason
we're down here!

1:04:39.484 --> 1:04:40.919
No, he keeps us in here

1:21:22.615 --> 1:21:23.878
Sarah!

1:21:25.489 --> 1:21:27.056
I need help.

1:21:34.236 --> 1:21:36.587
Sir? Sir?

1:21:40.982 --> 1:21:42.636
-May I have a word with you?
-Certainly.

1:21:42.722 --> 1:21:45.248

[machine beeping]

1:21:59.479 --> 1:22:01.742
Hey, it's okay,
it's okay, relax.

1:22:01.829 --> 1:22:05.311
Hey, breathe, relax.
Breathe deep breaths in and out.

1:22:05.355 --> 1:22:06.790
You're safe.

1:22:08.184 --> 1:22:11.100
-You're safe.
-Oh, where are we?

1:22:11.142 --> 1:22:13.189
We're at the hospital.

1:22:13.275 --> 1:22:14.798
We got out.

1:22:16.365 --> 1:22:17.932
Well, where's dad?

1:22:18.846 --> 1:22:21.065
The police arrested him.

1:22:23.242 --> 1:22:25.462
[Sarah] He's going away
for the rest of his life.

1:22:30.596 --> 1:22:33.644
We're safe. We're free.

1:22:33.730 --> 1:22:34.949

-[Chris] It's a surprise.
-Oh.

1:24:41.337 --> 1:24:43.078
[Sarah] We talked
about this once.

Do you remember?

House on a lake.

1:24:52.651 --> 1:24:53.784
Yeah.

1:25:01.007 --> 1:25:02.271
I'm sorry.

1:25:06.797 --> 1:25:08.624
I've been sorry for years.

1:25:11.714 --> 1:25:13.846
For what?

1:25:13.891 --> 1:25:16.414
Just for believing
that BS story.

1:25:18.503 --> 1:25:20.462
Not coming to find you.

1:25:22.333 --> 1:25:24.684
[sighs]

1:25:24.727 --> 1:25:29.297
I thought about you every day
for 20 years.

1:25:31.821 --> 1:25:34.476
It's, it's really good
to see you.

1:25:40.265 --> 1:25:42.311
Yeah, it's really good
to see you, too.

1:25:45.530 --> 1:25:49.186
I, uh, I, uh, I still
wanted to give you this.

1:25:49.230 --> 1:25:52.059
I've been holding on to it.

1:25:52.146 --> 1:25:54.191
Figured if you ever came back,
you might like it.

1:25:54.279 --> 1:25:55.498
[chuckles]

1:25:59.110 --> 1:26:00.589
-Oh, my gosh.
-Yeah.

Uh, 18-year-old me
put a lot of thought in that.

I remember,
I was pretty proud of myself.
