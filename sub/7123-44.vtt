Cinnamon Bun!

00:42.668 --> 00:44.545
What the heck are you
doing out in the woods?

00:44.628 --> 00:48.098
I asked you 20 minutes ago to
take these drinks around for us.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.550
Oh. Oh!

00:49.633 --> 00:52.261
"Around for us"!

00:52.344 --> 00:55.018
I thought you said "Walk
to the zoo and back."

00:55.097 --> 00:56.770
Gah!

00:59.017 --> 00:59.813
Finn,

00:59.893 --> 01:02.066
Cinnamon Bun's gonna
tend the juice bar now.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.897
I have a special job for you.

01:03.981 --> 01:07.076
As Ooo's greatest champion,
I'm relying on you to keep

01:07.150 --> 01:09.744
Lumpy Space Princess from
crashing this wedding.

01:09.820 --> 01:13.700
I went ahead and deputized you,
so, you know, no holds barred.

01:13.782 --> 01:14.578
Got it?

01:14.658 --> 01:15.830
Yeah!

01:15.909 --> 01:17.331
Oh. But what about Jake?

01:17.411 --> 01:20.540
Well, honestly, I haven't seen
Jake this happy in a while.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.769
I kind of don't want
to squash his groove.

01:24.793 --> 01:25.833
Hands off, little piggies!

01:27.921 --> 01:28.763
Knock knock!

01:28.839 --> 01:30.011
Hey, Tree Trunks!

01:30.090 --> 01:31.592
Oh, hey, Princess.

01:31.675 --> 01:32.892
Wow!

01:32.968 --> 01:36.438
You look prettier than a
sippy cup in a snow bank.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.390
Thanks, Tree Trunks.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.817
Now listen... I don't want
you to worry about a thing.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.691
I've got Finn on LSP duty, and
we're keeping your ex-husbands,

01:43.770 --> 01:48.446
Randy, Danny, and Wyatt, 100
feet apart at all times,

01:48.525 --> 01:51.278
at least until it's time for
me to perform the ceremony.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.238
Oh, well, uh, Princess...

01:53.322 --> 01:56.075
I appreciate your generosity,

01:56.158 --> 02:00.334
going to all this trouble to
hijack my wedding and all,

02:00.412 --> 02:03.131
but you can't perform
the ceremony.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.002
What?!

02:04.082 --> 02:04.878
Why not?

02:04.958 --> 02:09.964
Well, I'm sorry, but I just don't
recognize your "authority"

02:10.047 --> 02:11.640
on such matters.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.683
I can only be married
by his holiness,

02:13.759 --> 02:16.353
the one true king of Ooo.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.270
What?!

02:17.346 --> 02:18.438
That fraud?!

02:18.513 --> 02:19.765
Now, I know his teachings...

02:19.848 --> 02:21.646
That fraud is here?!

02:21.725 --> 02:23.648
Uh, why, yes, but...

02:24.728 --> 02:26.196
Oh, dear.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.571
Mama, I'm afraid I've
offended the Princess.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.618
Oh, nonsense, baby.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.162
She's probably just jealous
'cause you're about to marry

02:34.237 --> 02:37.081
such a handsome,
fine, saucy man!

02:37.157 --> 02:40.878
Oh, but he is a saucy
fine bolog-nah factory!

02:40.952 --> 02:41.952
Mm-hmm!

02:41.995 --> 02:42.995
I'll tell you what.

02:44.039 --> 02:47.919
I'd like to open up that hood,
see how the bolog-nah gets made!

02:48.001 --> 02:49.378
Mm!

02:49.461 --> 02:52.055
Mama, please!

02:52.130 --> 02:55.805
Please don't call him a saucy,
fine bolog-nah factory!

02:55.884 --> 02:57.807
Bolog-nah factory!

02:57.886 --> 02:59.888
Oh! My perfect day!

02:59.971 --> 03:02.019
What else could go wrong?

03:03.141 --> 03:07.146
Please go on... describe
the next "Thought-form."

03:07.229 --> 03:11.109
Um... l see, like,
reddish-green blotches.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.614
Ah! Ha ha ha!

03:13.694 --> 03:15.822
One year good luck.

03:17.322 --> 03:20.166
I've waited a long time
for this, king of Ooo.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.664
And now I'm gonna expose you in

03:21.743 --> 03:24.838
front of everyone for
what you really are.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.836
Yay!

03:26.915 --> 03:30.715
H-hey, barkeep, can I have
another one of these ciders?

03:30.794 --> 03:31.966
Sure!

03:40.011 --> 03:41.558
Hey, little robot,
how you doing?

03:41.638 --> 03:42.981
I am the best!

03:43.056 --> 03:47.857
I love weddings, I love flowers,
I love I-o-o-o-o-o-o-ove!

03:47.936 --> 03:50.985
Hey, did you know I used to
be married to Tree Trunks?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.611
N-o-o-o-o-o-o!

03:52.691 --> 03:54.284
Heh, yeah.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.453
It was just me and T.T.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.747
We had some wild times
back in the day.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.041
Did you know I once took
her to play tennis?

04:01.116 --> 04:02.117
N-o-o-o-o!

04:02.200 --> 04:03.827
Yep. Tennis.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.207
I took her to one of those,

04:05.287 --> 04:07.381
uh... paddles or
whatever, you know?

04:07.456 --> 04:08.457
No.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.133
Yeah, she left me.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.631
She said I was
stifling her spirit.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.304
I mean...

04:14.379 --> 04:16.099
You know, what... Not
enough tennis for you?

04:17.339 --> 04:18.387
No...

04:19.760 --> 04:21.603
It's starting!

04:21.678 --> 04:24.682
The ceremony is starting!

04:48.580 --> 04:49.627
Oh, no!

04:50.999 --> 04:52.046
No!

04:52.125 --> 04:53.752
Uh... please, stay here.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.337
This is cathartic.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.420
You're a good listener.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.965
Oh.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.425
Okay.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.103
Sweetie, you look so nice.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.976
Shh.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.932
Sounds really sweet.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.151
Lumpy Space Princess?

05:10.227 --> 05:11.227
Is that you?

05:11.269 --> 05:14.569
Let me go to this part-y-y-y!

05:14.648 --> 05:16.195
Aah!

05:16.274 --> 05:17.867
It's not your party, LSP.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.411
Poor Finn.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.534
Don't you know?

05:21.613 --> 05:23.286
Every party...

05:23.365 --> 05:24.867
is <i>my</i> Party!

05:35.669 --> 05:38.013

make sure everything's
in accordance...

05:41.758 --> 05:43.260
with the laws.

05:45.136 --> 05:45.978
Psst!

05:46.054 --> 05:47.727
Sweetie, what're you doing'?

05:47.806 --> 05:48.806
Hmm?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.775
Get out of my way, Finn!

05:54.855 --> 05:56.027
Oh, my glob!

05:56.106 --> 05:57.858
You're touching my woman's body!

05:59.651 --> 06:00.651
Okay, dear.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.321
Now up you come.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.122
Don't hurry this.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.243
Here we go.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.129
Whoa, whoa, kids!

06:11.204 --> 06:12.922
Got to finish the
ceremony first.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.420
Keep the baby in the basket.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.131
Everyone at the party get ready

06:17.210 --> 06:19.679
'cause here comes a
hot bunch of grapes!

06:21.381 --> 06:23.099
Aaaaaaaaah!

06:23.174 --> 06:24.096
Oh, my glob!

06:24.175 --> 06:27.145
We've gathered here on
this beautiful day,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.564
under my life-giving sun,

06:29.639 --> 06:32.859
to celebrate the
enjointment of Mr. Pig

06:32.934 --> 06:35.608
and Tree Trunks, the
little elephant.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.906
These two weird animals first...

06:37.981 --> 06:40.860
Oh, I bet some cute weddings
are happening over there.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.367
BMO, you're so nice.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.074
Those flowers look really cool.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.502
Oh, I've had a hard life.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.920
People seem cute.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.372
They seem nice.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.958
But then when you can't stop
crying because they beat you

06:56.041 --> 06:58.840
at tennis that one time,
they call you a baby!

06:58.919 --> 07:00.762
Yeah, cute nice babies.

07:00.837 --> 07:01.884
BMO?

07:01.963 --> 07:02.805
Mm-hmm?

07:02.881 --> 07:05.009
BMO, would you move in with me?

07:08.345 --> 07:12.976
Do you, Mr. Pig take Tree Trunks
to be your ever-wedded wife,

07:13.058 --> 07:15.607
forever following the
teachings of me,

07:15.685 --> 07:17.437
the true king of Ooo?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.520
I do.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.449
And do you, Tree Trunks...

07:24.527 --> 07:27.326
do you promise to love Mr.
Pig forever

07:27.405 --> 07:31.160
and spend the next five years
with me in my serenity compound,

07:31.242 --> 07:32.915
performing simple
household repairs,

07:32.994 --> 07:36.589
to have and to hold, in
sickness and in health,

07:36.665 --> 07:38.508

Hey, just what are

08:14.786 --> 08:16.788
I'll tell you what
I'm egging at.

08:16.871 --> 08:21.672
I'm egging at this outdated
wedding-officiant license!

08:21.751 --> 08:23.253
Oh!

08:23.336 --> 08:24.838
Oh, is that what this is about?

08:24.921 --> 08:26.889
You must've found that
in my back records.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.514
I have the up-to-date
paperwork right here.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.718
Oh!

08:30.802 --> 08:31.598
What?

08:31.678 --> 08:32.554
Uh...

08:32.636 --> 08:33.433
Hey, wait.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.434
How did you get that?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.140
I could've swore it
was locked in my zep.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.020
Nope! Shh!

08:37.100 --> 08:38.100
Nope' nope, nope!

08:38.143 --> 08:39.565
Stop talking! Go to jail!

08:39.644 --> 08:40.770
Oh!

08:40.854 --> 08:41.855
Yeah.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.863
Princess Bubblegum, you
have gone too far.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.742
We stand together
against your tyranny.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.664
Hey, everybody.

08:51.740 --> 08:56.371
Your prison may hold one of us,
but it may not hold all of us.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.754
Oh, poor Tree Trunks.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.801
Wait. Where's my mama?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.049
Has anyone see my...

09:05.128 --> 09:06.471
Oh!

No, mama!

Well, I guess this
is it, sweetie.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.309
Oh. Oh, no.

Hey, yeah!

09:36.993 --> 09:39.542
King of Ooo, will
you do the honors?

09:41.873 --> 09:42.669
Are you crazy?!

09:42.749 --> 09:44.843
That loopy bird is gonna
string me up sideways!

Oh, my gosh.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.471
Tree Trunks, did you hear?

09:52.550 --> 09:53.676
Huh?

09:53.760 --> 09:56.434
The king said you could perform
your own dang ceremony.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.857
Yeah, that really stung.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.104
But...

10:00.183 --> 10:03.187
but... the king's word is law.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.649
I can perform my
own dang ceremony?

10:07.732 --> 10:09.655
Are you up to it, T.T.?

10:09.734 --> 10:11.452

10:17.242 --> 10:19.461
Oh, okay. Urn, uh...

Do you, Mr. Pig, take
me, Tree Trunks,

10:23.706 --> 10:26.380
to be your beautiful
wedded wife?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.927
I do.

Tree Trunks?

10:34.551 --> 10:36.098
I do.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.305
Then, you...

10:38.388 --> 10:40.231
you may kiss the bride.
