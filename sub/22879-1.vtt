[♪♪♪]

00:42.143 --> 00:43.509
Thanks.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.283
So, there's this guy
in my building...

00:51.318 --> 00:52.384
[laughs] No.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.952
Can I at least
tell you about him?

00:53.988 --> 00:55.020
Mm, is
this peppermint?

00:55.056 --> 00:56.555
- Yes.
- Great! He's a fireman...

00:56.590 --> 00:58.023
Uh, "yes" to the peppermint,

00:58.059 --> 00:59.391
"no, thank you"
to the date.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.193
He's really cute
and he has a dog.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.461
Well, then you
should date him.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.529
But you're
my best friend,

01:03.564 --> 01:04.530
and it's the season
of giving!

01:04.565 --> 01:05.631
Come on, Melanie.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.499
What have you
got to lose?

01:08.769 --> 01:09.902
Okay.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.303
Great!

01:11.338 --> 01:12.482
Because I already
gave him your number.

01:12.506 --> 01:13.772
[laughs] What?

01:15.342 --> 01:16.241
Morning!

01:16.277 --> 01:17.342
Good morning.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.422
Did you have
a good weekend?

01:18.446 --> 01:20.312
I did.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.515
Oh, they lit up
the Christmas tree

01:23.551 --> 01:24.516
in Cummings Park
last night.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.717
Did you see it?

01:25.753 --> 01:26.885
I did not.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.487
You really should.
It is so special.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.556
They use, like
40,000 lights.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.759
I'll keep that in mind.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.661
Oh, hey, uh, Donovan?

01:35.696 --> 01:37.029
Good luck today.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.530
Thank you.

01:39.967 --> 01:40.899
Should've been yours.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.067
Hmm?

01:42.103 --> 01:43.702
The Evergreen Mobile
Christmas pitch.

01:43.737 --> 01:46.004
Well, Mr. Farnsworth
gave it to Donovan.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.906
What was I supposed to do?
Fight him for it?

01:47.942 --> 01:50.275
Yes! Earnest and heartwarming...
That's your wheelhouse.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.644
I don't own Christmas.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.014
[♪♪♪]

02:01.455 --> 02:03.755
You didn't
want a crack at it?

02:03.791 --> 02:06.692
Well, maybe a little.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.227
You know what
your problem is?

02:08.262 --> 02:09.527
No.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.130
You're too nice.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.465
Okay, there is no such thing
as "too nice".

02:13.501 --> 02:14.533
Sure there is.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.701
You stayed quiet

02:15.736 --> 02:17.914
while someone else bid on
an account you were perfect for,

02:17.938 --> 02:20.906
and you agreed to a blind date
you never wanted to go on.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.275
That you set me up on!

02:23.310 --> 02:25.210
And you caved,
like always.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.145
Too nice.

02:26.180 --> 02:29.114
Okay, you know what?
You're way off-base.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.115
- Okay.
- Hey, Melanie

02:30.151 --> 02:31.628
The photographer from
the ketchup campaign's

02:31.652 --> 02:32.484
on the phone.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.419
He needs to bump
Friday's shoot again.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.787
- Scheduling conflict.
- What?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.033
He told me he was
available this time.

02:37.057 --> 02:40.259
Well, he seems pretty firm,
but I could try to push back?

02:40.294 --> 02:42.327
Uh, well, no, don't do that.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.229
Um... do you know what?
Don't worry about it.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.442
I'm sure I can move
some stuff around.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.399
You got it.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.402
What?

02:51.605 --> 02:53.906
Okay. I'll work on it.

02:53.941 --> 02:54.840
Good!

02:54.875 --> 02:56.319
But I'm holding you
to that blind date.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.044
He really is
a great guy.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.114
[loud clapping]

03:02.149 --> 03:05.584
All right, everybody!
It's that time of year again!

03:05.619 --> 03:08.587
Gather around, please,
gather around.

03:08.622 --> 03:12.124
Now, as you know
the Secret Santa gift exchange

03:12.159 --> 03:15.327
is a ritual as old
as Farnsworth advertising.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.695
It was started
by my grandfather

03:16.730 --> 03:19.031
and has become
a time-honored tradition.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.500
You folks work hard all year,

03:21.535 --> 03:22.701
so it's important to remember

03:22.736 --> 03:25.170
what this season
is really about.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.338
Tracey has a hat!

03:26.373 --> 03:28.040
It's got
everybody's name in it.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.608
She's gonna
make her way around,

03:29.643 --> 03:32.477
and when she gets to you,
grab a slip.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.613
I'm gonna pass.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.982
[Farnsworth]: Uh, participation
is mandatory, Donovan.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.985
Absolutely no exceptions.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.387
Now, you have three weeks
until the Christmas party

03:42.423 --> 03:45.157
to really get to know
the person that you pick

03:45.192 --> 03:47.859
and figure out a thoughtful gift
under $50.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.061
After all...

03:49.096 --> 03:50.696
we are an ad agency,

03:50.731 --> 03:52.831
so it's not an exaggeration
to say

03:52.866 --> 03:54.199
it's your job

03:54.235 --> 03:56.868
to figure out
what makes a person tick.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.571
This is also
an intra-office activity,

03:59.607 --> 04:01.840
so, for some of you,
it'll be a good opportunity

04:01.875 --> 04:04.142
to get to know your co-workers
in other departments.

04:04.178 --> 04:05.043
Fingers crossed
you don't

04:05.079 --> 04:07.012
draw the mailroom
on the first floor!

04:07.047 --> 04:09.047
Yeah, right.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.483
[Farnsworth]: I hope you embrace
this little tradition.

04:11.518 --> 04:15.520
It really does make
our holiday party extra-special.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.055
[♪♪♪]

04:20.293 --> 04:23.662
We're greeted with
a big, beautiful vista.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.831
The man grabs
his Evergreen phone,

04:25.866 --> 04:29.401
sweeps the panorama
with the phone's camera.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.903
Then... the screen goes black.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.839
In stark white letters...

04:33.874 --> 04:37.109
"Evergreen Mobile...

04:37.144 --> 04:39.378
distance...

04:39.413 --> 04:41.013
erased."

04:42.449 --> 04:44.916
Well, you certainly
know our product.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.452
That presentation says
"sleek, modern."

04:47.488 --> 04:49.488
What it doesn't say
is "Christmas."

04:51.125 --> 04:53.725
Well, I-it might not have
come across on the storyboards,

04:53.761 --> 04:54.626
but there will be

04:54.662 --> 04:56.695
a heavy emphasis
on the winter setting...

04:56.730 --> 04:57.863
Trees, snow...

04:59.099 --> 05:00.539
That still doesn't
give me "holiday."

05:01.669 --> 05:03.435
Mr. O'Ryan, I mean,
all fairness,

05:03.470 --> 05:04.936
we're selling cellphones.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.472
All year,
we have dozens of ads

05:07.508 --> 05:09.875
that push our functionality
and design.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.177
Our annual holiday commercial's
an appeal to the heart.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.713
Heart?

05:14.748 --> 05:16.315
Last year's
featured a little girl

05:16.350 --> 05:18.250
building a snowman
for her baby sister.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.484
It was very touching

05:19.520 --> 05:21.253
and it really struck a chord.

05:21.288 --> 05:24.956
Shared over five million times
from our social media accounts.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.825
I appreciate your time
and effort,

05:26.860 --> 05:28.593
but this isn't
what we're looking for.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.429
Well, this is all
excellent feedback.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.731
I'm sure, uh,
Donovan here's

05:32.766 --> 05:34.177
gonna take that direction
and really run with it.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.167
Of course.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.135
I'll be frank.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.015
We have multiple agencies
tackling this campaign,

05:39.039 --> 05:40.238
and I've promised them all

05:40.274 --> 05:41.318
a decision
by the end of next week.

05:41.342 --> 05:44.609
Mr. O'Ryan, I can give you
exactly what you want.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.645
I just need the chance.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.249
Okay. I'll circle back around

05:51.285 --> 05:52.851
and check in with you
next Thursday,

05:52.886 --> 05:55.120
before I make my final choice.

05:57.358 --> 05:59.591
[♪♪♪]

06:01.195 --> 06:03.095
[Jude]: What do you
think this says?

06:03.130 --> 06:06.665
[Melanie]: Uh... fire...
"firetruck".

06:07.835 --> 06:09.468
- Cool!
- Yeah.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.669
Yeah, I can see that.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.505
Next year, I'm getting Zach
to write his letter to Santa

06:13.540 --> 06:14.639
in colored pencil.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.842
The markers
always smudge.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.044
Hey...

06:19.079 --> 06:20.679
Do you think
I'm a pushover?

06:22.015 --> 06:24.383
No.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.218
Are you just saying that
to spare my feelings?

06:28.355 --> 06:29.355
Really?

06:29.390 --> 06:31.523
You're just... nice.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.870
Why does everybody
keep saying that,

06:33.894 --> 06:34.826
like it's a bad thing?

06:34.862 --> 06:35.894
It's not.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.562
It's just you have
this tendency

06:37.598 --> 06:38.964
to put everyone
else's feelings

06:38.999 --> 06:40.499
before your own.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.034
And since when is it
a crime to be considerate?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.303
Melly, you know
I love you,

06:45.339 --> 06:46.671
and the world
could really

06:46.707 --> 06:47.884
use a lot more people
with your outlook,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.474
but there are times

06:49.510 --> 06:52.177
when it's okay
to just put yourself first.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.681
Hmm.

06:58.352 --> 07:00.063
Hey, do you have any clue
what I could get Zach?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.987
Yep. Here.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.655
You don't need it?

07:03.690 --> 07:04.656
Oh, we have backup.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.858
Thanks.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.727
Oh!

07:11.632 --> 07:13.432
[sniffs] What do
you think of this?

07:13.467 --> 07:15.167
He's six.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.401
Oh, no, not for Zach.

07:16.437 --> 07:17.702
For my office
Secret Santa.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.704
Well, does he
like cologne?

07:19.740 --> 07:21.373
I don't know.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.507
Well, what
does he like?

07:22.543 --> 07:23.742
I don't know.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.777
Wow.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.512
You're usually so good
at finding the perfect gift.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.125
I know, I know, this guy's
really tricky, though.

07:29.149 --> 07:32.217
He's been at our office
for, like, almost a year,

07:32.252 --> 07:34.453
and I don't know
the first thing about him.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.922
I mean, honestly, I have
no idea where to start.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.524
Well, so,
why don't you ask?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.526
Because
it's "Secret" Santa.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.530
So ask... secretly.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.743
Hi, Mittens.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.913
[exhales] Okay.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.062
Do you have
my advent calendar?

09:24.097 --> 09:25.997
Oh, you mean
the cute Santa one?

09:26.033 --> 09:26.965
Yes. That one!

09:27.000 --> 09:28.500
Nope. Haven't seen it.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.402
[grumbles] 'Kay. Let's...

09:30.437 --> 09:31.503
Oh! Wait!

09:31.538 --> 09:33.371
Never mind.
Found it!

09:33.407 --> 09:34.739
You're only
just decorating now?

09:34.775 --> 09:36.341
That is so unlike you.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.509
I know, I know.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.044
I normally have
this place decorated

09:39.079 --> 09:40.478
way before Thanksgiving.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.347
I'm a little late
this time.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.082
<i>Anyway, I'm gonna
call you later, okay?</i>

09:44.117 --> 09:46.117
Bye!

09:56.129 --> 09:57.996
Well, that doesn't help us,
does it, Mittens?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.297
Meow.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.038
So Donovan wants
a tie for Christmas.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.840
You're exchanging
gifts now?

10:08.875 --> 10:10.508
Oh, no, no,
I'm his Secret Santa.

10:10.544 --> 10:11.376
Then get him a tie.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.378
Well, that's not
very thoughtful, is it?

10:13.413 --> 10:14.613
So add a card
that says

10:14.648 --> 10:16.348
"I thought
you might like this."

10:16.383 --> 10:18.550
I don't think that it works
quite like that...

10:18.585 --> 10:20.085
Oh, Melanie,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

10:20.120 --> 10:22.020
but, uh, Farnsworth
needs to see you.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.422
Oh. Did he say
what it was about?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.725
No clue. He said
just head over right now.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.027
Okay.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.802
If you need to speak
to Mr. Farnsworth,

10:37.838 --> 10:38.903
it's gonna have to wait.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.105
He asked to see me.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.074
Oh, uh, actually,
he asked to see me, too.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.577
[knocking]

10:47.014 --> 10:48.213
Hi.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.528
Come on in, you two.
Have a seat.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.551
Melanie...

10:53.587 --> 10:56.388
you're familiar with
the Evergreen Mobile account?

10:56.423 --> 10:57.656
Yes. Yes.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.457
This is a unique opportunity.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.959
Securing
this Christmas commercial

11:00.994 --> 11:02.794
would mean big things
for our agency.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.262
Absolutely! Yeah.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.563
So I've decided to team you up.

11:05.599 --> 11:06.564
I'm sorry...

11:06.600 --> 11:07.499
Team us up?

11:07.534 --> 11:08.333
That's not really necessary.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.679
I have it completely
under control.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.436
This isn't
a punishment, Donovan.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.005
Look, I love what
you bring to the project.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.674
I just think
that you and Melanie

11:15.709 --> 11:17.075
would complement each other.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.010
I'm sure she's busy
with all of her projects.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.112
She probably doesn't
even want to do it.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.582
I-I do have
a lot on my plate.

11:24.618 --> 11:25.950
See?

11:25.986 --> 11:27.185
I should go at this alone.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.087
Well, I've already
made up my mind.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.588
So, Melanie,
any current assignments

11:30.624 --> 11:32.524
I want you to slide on over
to Jacqueline.

11:32.559 --> 11:33.858
This takes priority.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.927
Okay.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.796
You start immediately.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.832
I got a good feeling
about this partnership.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.670
It's clever.
It's high-energy. It's...

11:45.706 --> 11:46.638
...A little

11:46.673 --> 11:48.339
cold.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.375
It's winter.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.942
Oh, that's not
what I meant.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.644
Um, Christmas commercials
are supposed

11:52.679 --> 11:54.612
to evoke a feeling

11:54.648 --> 11:57.348
of fun and family
and warmth.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.818
Have you ever used
an Evergreen phone?

11:59.853 --> 12:00.997
Because you can't sell
what you don't know.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.021
Yes. I have.

12:02.055 --> 12:02.954
It's not
about "fun".

12:02.989 --> 12:05.857
It's about
the 64-bit quad-core chipset,

12:05.892 --> 12:07.492
40% faster performance,

12:07.527 --> 12:09.661
256 gigabytes of storage,

12:09.696 --> 12:11.730
and oleophobic coating.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.910
So, what, do you suggest that
we put Santa in a business suit

12:13.934 --> 12:15.967
and have him order
the gifts for the kids online?

12:16.002 --> 12:17.569
Yes! I like that!

12:17.604 --> 12:19.304
- I'm joking.
- [Donovan sighs]

12:19.339 --> 12:21.506
Donovan. Okay...

12:21.541 --> 12:23.575
Christmas isn't sleek.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.143
It's messy.

12:25.178 --> 12:28.146
It's families singing
Christmas carols off-key.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.081
It's giving
your family presents

12:30.117 --> 12:31.850
that they didn't even
know they wanted.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.518
It's...

12:33.553 --> 12:35.653
it's magic.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.188
The only thing magical
about Christmas

12:37.224 --> 12:38.224
are the sales numbers.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.527
Okay, um...

12:42.562 --> 12:44.162
Do you know...
I have an idea.

12:44.197 --> 12:47.866
Why don't you tell me about
your favorite Christmas memory?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.437
Last year,
I went skiing in Aspen.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.372
With your family...?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.574
Look, I'd like to focus
on the campaign.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.076
We only have two weeks left.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.043
Yeah, no, no.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.846
I-I was just trying
to find a starting point.

13:01.882 --> 13:02.914
All right, look.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.060
We're obviously
at an impasse.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.018
So... let's split up,

13:07.053 --> 13:08.186
mock up some ideas.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.254
Independently.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.222
Uh, Farnsworth
specifically said

13:11.258 --> 13:12.301
we should work on it together.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.191
And we will!

13:13.226 --> 13:14.692
Later.

13:15.595 --> 13:16.628
Okay.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.862
All right,
if you think

13:17.898 --> 13:19.798
that it's the best
way to do it.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.766
Let's reconvene
tomorrow.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.636
Sure.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.671
Yep.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.875
[♪♪♪]

14:01.975 --> 14:03.441
Good morning!

14:05.111 --> 14:06.511
Morning.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.846
Are you ready to reconvene?

14:07.881 --> 14:09.581
Yeah, pull up a chair.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.382
Yeah. Sure.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.654
Ready for
your thoughts.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.424
I've used the Evergreen phone
for over a month now...

14:19.459 --> 14:20.625
Yeah.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.004
And the video chat
is the best aspect.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.028
Smooth video, crisp audio.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.663
You know what?
This past Christmas,

14:25.699 --> 14:27.643
my parents couldn't make it
out here for Christmas,

14:27.667 --> 14:29.667
and my sister and I
weren't able to make it back,

14:29.703 --> 14:32.670
so we actually video-chatted
the entire Christmas dinner,

14:32.706 --> 14:34.806
right from cooking the turkey
to eating the meal,

14:34.841 --> 14:35.974
to unwrapping the presents.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.175
- The whole day?
- Yeah!

14:37.210 --> 14:38.977
Why?

14:39.012 --> 14:41.779
Well, because we wanted
to be together...

14:43.016 --> 14:45.350
Sounds like
a hassle to me.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.318
Oh, no, no, no.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.219
It was
totally worth it.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.832
That's what Christmas
is all about, right?

14:49.856 --> 14:51.089
Being with
the people you love.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.525
No, Christmas is about people
spending money they don't have

14:54.561 --> 14:55.927
on gifts
that people don't want.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.165
Okay, you know what
I think we need?

15:02.435 --> 15:05.670
I think we need
some Christmas reconnaissance.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.539
So what do you propose we do?
Go stake out a mall Santa?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.141
Funny, but no.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.687
You can't sell
what you don't know, right?

15:11.711 --> 15:13.378
That's right.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.757
So, there's this
craft holiday fair,

15:14.781 --> 15:16.547
it's just outside of town.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.727
I think we could get
some really good

15:17.751 --> 15:19.183
inspiration from there.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.084
And if we don't,

15:20.120 --> 15:22.520
we can always get
a good cup of hot cocoa.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.689
Let's do it! Okay.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.461
[♪♪♪]

15:45.245 --> 15:47.745
So... take
a look around.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.882
What am I looking at?

15:50.917 --> 15:52.083
Love.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.520
Happiness. Wonder.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.021
[chuckles dryly]

15:57.057 --> 15:59.624
I think you've been
peddling Christmas too long.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.225
You're buying into
this way too much.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.226
I don't
peddle Christmas.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.695
I celebrate it.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.163
If you say so.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.699
Isn't that a little cynical?

16:07.734 --> 16:08.633
It's realistic.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.934
Do you know

16:09.970 --> 16:12.637
how many people see the annual
Evergreen Christmas commercial?

16:12.672 --> 16:15.073
It is off the charts,

16:15.108 --> 16:16.641
and we get to reach
all of those people

16:16.676 --> 16:19.911
with a message of family
and generosity and hope.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.379
And cellphones.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.081
Yes, but just because
we're selling phones

16:23.116 --> 16:25.783
doesn't mean we can't say
something meaningful. Okay?

16:25.819 --> 16:29.287
Oh. Okay. Wait. Look at
that little girl right there.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.557
Do you see how her whole face
is lit up with excitement?

16:32.592 --> 16:33.691
That's because,

16:33.727 --> 16:37.061
right now, she's talking
to <i> the</i> Santa Claus,

16:37.097 --> 16:38.574
something she's been
waiting for all year.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.598
That, right there,

16:39.632 --> 16:41.899
is what
we want to tap into.

16:41.935 --> 16:42.979
When people see our campaign,

16:43.003 --> 16:43.768
we want them to remember

16:43.803 --> 16:46.270
those cherished
holiday memories.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.472
The thing is,

16:47.507 --> 16:49.507
I don't have
memories like that.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.776
What? Any?

16:51.811 --> 16:54.278
Growing up, December was
just another month in our house.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.181
Well...

16:57.217 --> 16:59.584
I'm about to give you
a crash course.

17:00.954 --> 17:02.920
Come on! Keep up!

17:03.990 --> 17:06.656
Right here. Hi!

17:06.693 --> 17:07.936
Oh, it's so good
to see you, dear!

17:07.961 --> 17:09.093
You too, Bea.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.295
This is Donovan,
my co-worker.

17:11.330 --> 17:15.266
Bea makes the best cookies
in all of Connecticut.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.202
Oh, thank you, dear.
You're so sweet.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.804
We're actually
gonna need

17:19.839 --> 17:21.472
a half-dozen of your
gingerbread cookies

17:21.508 --> 17:22.508
with buttercream icing.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.108
Oh, I-I don't eat sugar.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.877
At all?

17:25.912 --> 17:28.012
Not if I can
help it, no.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.481
Thank you.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.350
Just...

17:32.385 --> 17:33.785
indulge me?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.019
Please?

17:35.055 --> 17:37.221
Christmas spirit
is sensory.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.224
It's all about
seeing the lights,

17:40.260 --> 17:42.527
you smell the smells...

17:42.562 --> 17:46.464
and you taste
the tastes...

17:53.840 --> 17:54.972
So?

17:55.008 --> 17:56.474
It's okay.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.811
[incredulous chuckle]

17:59.846 --> 18:00.711
These cookies,

18:00.747 --> 18:03.014
they have a memory
attached to them for me.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.349
It reminds me of making
gingerbread cookies

18:05.385 --> 18:07.085
with my mom
and my sister, Jude.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.487
We'd always sneak little
tastes out of the bowl

18:09.522 --> 18:11.033
and my mom would
pretend not to notice.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.124
You know, that can actually
make you sick, right?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.327
So when I taste
these cookies,

18:16.362 --> 18:18.496
I'm reminded
of those afternoons,

18:18.531 --> 18:20.698
covered in flour...

18:20.733 --> 18:22.366
and it makes me happy.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.402
Sounds like
a nice memory.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.270
It is.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.706
Can I have
another cookie?

18:28.741 --> 18:29.741
[surprised laugh]

18:39.686 --> 18:41.252
Hi there.
Merry Christmas.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.320
You too.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.955
What do you think of this?

18:43.990 --> 18:46.757
Um, well,
who's it for?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.426
My Secret Santa.

18:48.461 --> 18:52.096
Well...
does she wear bracelets?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.664
I don't know.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.999
Doesn't every woman?

18:55.034 --> 18:57.301
Oh, no. No.

18:57.337 --> 19:00.004
Women who draw, or type a lot,
like myself,

19:00.039 --> 19:01.873
we tend to stay
clear of bracelets,

19:01.908 --> 19:02.874
'cause they knock
on the keyboard,

19:02.909 --> 19:04.153
and then some women
love to wear necklaces,

19:04.177 --> 19:05.343
but others never wear them,

19:05.378 --> 19:06.655
that's not even touching
on the question

19:06.679 --> 19:09.046
of gold versus
silver, so.

19:09.082 --> 19:10.214
Wow. Okay.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.617
This is gonna be a little more
complicated than I thought.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.417
Or you could tell me
who she is

19:13.453 --> 19:14.530
and I'll tell you
what she likes.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.653
Nice try.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.030
Are those stars?

19:26.065 --> 19:27.965
No, they're
snowflakes.

19:28.001 --> 19:31.002
My grandmother had
a pair just like them.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.271
She wore them every Christmas.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.573
They're beautiful.

19:35.608 --> 19:36.807
Thank you.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.711
It was educational.

20:13.746 --> 20:14.845
Good! That's good.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.514
Uh, this is me.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.716
Oh. I've got
something for you.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.518
Oh, but you didn't have
to get me any...

20:20.553 --> 20:21.764
It's my market
strategy analysis.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.454
See if you can have it
read by tomorrow.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.701
I think it'll really help us
focus our direction. Goodnight!

20:25.725 --> 20:26.924
But the cook...

20:30.496 --> 20:32.230
Yeah.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.100
[Melanie]:
I just don't get it.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.802
He's so cynical.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.304
I mean,
who dislikes Christmas?

20:40.340 --> 20:42.273
You do realize
you don't have to fix him,

20:42.308 --> 20:43.874
you just need
to get him a present?

20:43.910 --> 20:45.087
Well, it's not
about the present.

20:45.111 --> 20:48.980
Although Farnsworth takes
the gift-giving very seriously.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.748
Oh! Bud! Are you done?

20:50.783 --> 20:51.927
Are you ready
for your big reveal there?

20:51.951 --> 20:52.883
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

20:52.919 --> 20:54.552
One...

20:54.587 --> 20:56.587
Two...

20:56.623 --> 20:58.289
Three!

20:58.324 --> 21:00.224
[sisters cheering]

21:00.260 --> 21:01.425
That's a good one.
High-five!

21:01.461 --> 21:02.793
Good job!

21:02.829 --> 21:06.063
Okay, so if it's
not about the gift,

21:06.099 --> 21:08.132
what is it about?

21:08.167 --> 21:10.268
It's about creating
a heartwarming ad

21:10.303 --> 21:11.269
with a person who thinks

21:11.304 --> 21:13.237
Christmas is nothing
but a marketing scheme.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.339
Well, if anyone
can sell a person

21:15.375 --> 21:16.774
on the magic of Christmas,

21:16.809 --> 21:18.776
it's you, little sis.

[Donovan]: Why is it important

21:54.914 --> 21:57.448
that you give me
the right gift?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.455
<i>It's my job.</i>

22:04.490 --> 22:07.525
I'm your Secret Santa.

that what you really need</i>

22:12.065 --> 22:15.333
is some good, old-fashioned

22:15.368 --> 22:18.903
holiday cheer.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.539

22:23.843 --> 22:26.477
Thank you.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.813
[♪♪♪]

22:30.683 --> 22:33.384
We'll see about that,
won't we?

22:38.891 --> 22:40.157
Good morning.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.092
Good morning.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.060
You still want to work
at the cafe today?

22:43.096 --> 22:44.528
Yes. I don't think

22:44.564 --> 22:45.874
I can drink another cup
of that breakroom coffee.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.064
I know what you mean.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.666
That stuff should have
an octane rating.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.434
I'm just gonna grab
some files on my desk.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.747
I had Steve research
the last five years

22:51.771 --> 22:53.003
of holiday campaigns

22:53.039 --> 22:54.572
with the highest
social media impact.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.673
Seems important
to them.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.174
Good thinking.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.210
Thanks.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.583
[♪♪♪]

23:16.629 --> 23:19.430
So how did you
sneak over to my desk

23:19.465 --> 23:21.132
without me seeing?

23:21.167 --> 23:22.767
I wasn't
at your desk today.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.871
I know you put
that Christmas tree on my desk.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.706
What Christmas tree?

23:28.741 --> 23:30.775
Melanie...

23:30.810 --> 23:32.543
you don't have
to pretend.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.479
I put it together
after the first email.

23:35.515 --> 23:39.150
Okay, I'm sorry,
you've totally lost me now.

23:39.185 --> 23:42.052
Okay, so you're saying

23:42.088 --> 23:44.622
that you're not
my Secret Santa?

23:44.657 --> 23:46.724
[both chuckling]

23:46.759 --> 23:47.925
[phone dings]

23:47.960 --> 23:49.360
Oh, hold on.

23:53.299 --> 23:54.632
Is everything okay?

23:56.602 --> 23:58.769
Yeah. Yeah.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.474
Guess I was wrong.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.014
[exhales deeply]

24:10.049 --> 24:11.660
Looks like we're going
to be here for a while.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.250
Yeah, looks like it.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.553
[sighs]

24:17.957 --> 24:19.590
What if we did
something with snowmen?

24:19.625 --> 24:20.858
You know, one of them

24:20.893 --> 24:21.970
ventures out of
the front yard

24:21.994 --> 24:24.028
and into the big city?

24:24.063 --> 24:25.629
They did that two years ago.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.498
[sighing]

24:27.533 --> 24:28.973
All right.
Add it to the reject pile.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.303
It's 7:00 already?

24:33.372 --> 24:35.139
Uh, I'm sorry,
I've got to go.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.334
I have dinner at my sister's.

24:37.443 --> 24:39.221
You know, we're listening to our
grandmother's Christmas records,

24:39.245 --> 24:41.312
and trimming the tree, and...

24:41.347 --> 24:43.047
I've lost you,
haven't I?

24:43.082 --> 24:45.349
At "sister's," yeah.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.485
Anyway, I have to go,
because, if not, I'll be late,

24:47.520 --> 24:48.831
and then I'll never hear
the end of it.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.822
Okay, well, I'll, um,
I'll hold down the fort.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.691
You should come.

24:53.726 --> 24:54.892
To your family dinner?

24:54.927 --> 24:56.293
Sure.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.873
Yeah, I mean,
we've been at this for hours,

24:57.897 --> 24:59.964
and a break might help,

24:59.999 --> 25:01.465
and you can't live on coffee
forever.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.300
I don't think so.

25:03.336 --> 25:06.337
A change of scenery might
be good for the inspiration.

25:08.574 --> 25:12.042
[chuckles]

25:12.078 --> 25:13.477
What's for dinner?

25:13.513 --> 25:14.979
Yes! Let's pack up.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.547
All right.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.219
You know you didn't have
to bring anything, right?

25:22.255 --> 25:24.989
I'm already intruding
on a dinner I wasn't invited to,

25:25.024 --> 25:26.724
I'm not gonna
show up empty-handed.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.726
You made it!

25:28.761 --> 25:31.262
And you brought a person
I've never met!

25:31.297 --> 25:33.497
Yes, oh, and
he brought wine.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.232
Uh, this is Donovan.
He's my co-worker.

25:35.268 --> 25:36.767
I asked him
to tag along.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.536
I hope it's not
an inconvenience.

25:38.571 --> 25:41.205
No! No, of course not.
The more, the merrier.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.641
Please. Come inside.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.777
The guy who
dislikes Christmas?

25:46.812 --> 25:47.945
Oh, yeah.
It's a long story.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.046
Can't wait to hear it.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.217
So, Zach, are you
excited for Santa?

25:53.252 --> 25:54.463
Yeah. I've been
a really good boy this year.

25:54.487 --> 25:55.487
He sure has.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.454
Last week, I caught him
cleaning out the garage.

25:57.490 --> 25:58.789
Wow!

25:58.824 --> 25:59.757
You know what, buddy?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.303
I don't think you have
much to worry about.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.960
You're a pretty good kid
all year round.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.429
Yes, but Santa certainly
appreciates the effort.

26:05.464 --> 26:06.730
[adults chuckling]

26:06.766 --> 26:08.399
Right.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.936
Donovan, how do you
and your family

26:11.971 --> 26:13.470
celebrate Christmas?

26:13.506 --> 26:14.972
Any fun traditions?

26:15.007 --> 26:16.307
Uh, no.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.708
Not really.

26:17.743 --> 26:18.809
Nothing at all?

26:18.844 --> 26:21.645
Mm, we're not really close.

26:21.681 --> 26:24.715
Oh.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.917
Mom? Could I have
some mashed potatoes?

Sure, sweetie.

I made it last year!

26:44.537 --> 26:45.903
Well, you did a fantastic job.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.072
You can have it.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.740
Oh, no, no, no.
I can't take this!

26:49.775 --> 26:50.741
It's a gift.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.479
Thank you.

bringing for Christmas?

27:10.663 --> 27:11.695
Pecan pie?

27:11.731 --> 27:13.097
Mom called dibs
on the pie,

27:13.132 --> 27:15.165
but we have
an opening for cookies.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.034
Okay. I can do that.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.469
It was nice meeting
you, Donovan.

27:18.504 --> 27:19.603
Likewise.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.337
Thank you again
for the lovely dinner.

- See you soon.
- You're welcome.

- Bye, Melly.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.809
- Okay.
- Okay, take care.

27:25.845 --> 27:26.710
- Bye.
- Good night.

27:26.746 --> 27:27.878
Melly?

27:27.913 --> 27:29.546
Yeah,
it's a childhood nickname.

I like it.
It suits you.

Hey, Dad.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.568
It's me.

27:51.604 --> 27:54.938
Um, I was wondering
if you were free next week.

27:54.974 --> 27:58.876
I thought maybe we could
grab some dinner or something.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.844

29:15.521 --> 29:17.821
He has no idea
it's you?

29:17.857 --> 29:20.624
No, I set my Secret Santa email
to "delayed sending"

29:20.659 --> 29:22.504
so that he would get it
when we were out together.

I'm discovering so many things

He has a sense of humor!

29:59.298 --> 30:01.532
I'm gonna need
video evidence for that.

30:01.567 --> 30:04.067
It's true. I swear.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.536
How can he not
guess it's you?

30:05.571 --> 30:07.004
I mean,

30:07.039 --> 30:08.517
who else would care enough
to get an email account

30:08.541 --> 30:09.506
just to figure out

30:09.542 --> 30:11.052
what her Secret Santa
wanted for Christmas?

30:11.076 --> 30:13.177
It's a big building.

Hey. What're
we looking at?

30:15.881 --> 30:17.714
Oh! Uh...
Nothing.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.461
Just the Evergreen phone.
Melanie's on the pitch now.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.385
Oh. Right!

30:21.420 --> 30:22.386
- We'll talk later.
- Sure.

You know Tracey fairly well,
don't you?

30:27.126 --> 30:29.126
Yeah.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.361
Any idea what she might like
for Christmas?

30:32.932 --> 30:36.433
Sounds like somebody is fishing
for a Secret Santa gift.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.969
Well, if someone
<i>were</i> fishing...

30:39.004 --> 30:40.604
In this totally
hypothetical situation,

30:40.639 --> 30:42.573
I would tell them

30:42.608 --> 30:44.219
that she's highly addicted
to the peppermint lattes

30:44.243 --> 30:46.443
from the cafe
across the street.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.946
You're the best.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.551
What about a story
about our military

30:54.587 --> 30:56.220
overseas on Christmas?

30:56.255 --> 30:58.133
O'Ryan wouldn't want
anything too heartbreaking.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.623
A Christmas dog.

30:59.658 --> 31:02.326
He delivers the paper,
then he delivers the slippers,

31:02.361 --> 31:04.828
and then he delivers
the Evergreen phone.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.296
You're not serious, are you?

31:06.332 --> 31:08.432
Apparently not.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.467
[vibrating, buzzing]

31:13.339 --> 31:14.304
[sighs heavily]

31:14.340 --> 31:16.273
Everything okay?

31:16.308 --> 31:18.008
Uh, yeah. No, it's fine.

31:18.043 --> 31:20.310
It's just this photographer.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.446
He's been giving me
the runaround for a few days.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.448
We hired him for
the ketchup campaign,

31:24.483 --> 31:27.584
and he's just been
really unreliable.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.453
I thought Jacqueline
took that account over.

31:29.488 --> 31:32.089
Uh, no, she did, she did.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.991
She, um... he's just
been so difficult,

31:34.026 --> 31:35.626
I said
that I would handle him.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.539
You know, I don't want
to saddle her with a headache.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.096
I see.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.530
What?

31:40.566 --> 31:43.133
Oh. Nothing.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.570
You obviously want
to say something.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.608
I just noticed that
you have a tendency to...

31:51.644 --> 31:53.510
be overly accommodating.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.345
So?

31:55.381 --> 31:57.981
So I think it'd be good for you
to learn how to say no.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.783
You won't offend people.

31:59.818 --> 32:03.654
They might
appreciate your... honesty.

32:03.689 --> 32:07.224
Well, that's coming
from the expert, so...

32:07.259 --> 32:08.458
What expert?

32:10.062 --> 32:13.430
You, um, have a tendency
to be...

32:16.402 --> 32:18.201
Well, not so friendly.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.504
That's not true.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.572
You've been working with us
for almost a year.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.219
Why don't you ever go out
with us after work?

32:24.243 --> 32:27.077
I'm here to do a job,
not make friends.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.146
Okay, but you can
actually do both.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.380
So, what?

32:30.416 --> 32:33.383
Spend my Friday nights
shooting pool?

32:33.419 --> 32:34.596
Chit-chatting with Joe
from accounting?

32:34.620 --> 32:36.720
Joe is actually really nice,

32:36.755 --> 32:37.888
and he's got great stories.

32:37.923 --> 32:40.424
And anyway, what's so bad
about chit-chatting with Joe?

32:40.459 --> 32:42.659
He might actually be
your Secret Santa.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.195
He's not my Secret Santa.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.697
Oh, and how do you know that?

32:46.732 --> 32:49.466
I just do.

32:50.703 --> 32:52.636
All right.

33:00.879 --> 33:02.612
[Donovan, writing]

33:02.648 --> 33:04.214
[ding]

33:06.085 --> 33:08.952
Uh, I'm gonna go get a refill.
Do you want anything?

33:08.988 --> 33:11.054
No. I'm fine.
Thanks.

33:16.095 --> 33:19.529
[Melanie, writing]: <i>Honestly?
I think you can be.</i>

33:20.766 --> 33:23.100
[ding]

33:25.504 --> 33:28.238
[Donovan, thinking]

33:32.978 --> 33:35.512
[Melanie, writing]

33:41.086 --> 33:43.053
[Donovan, continuing]

33:44.590 --> 33:47.357
[Melanie, writing]

33:51.597 --> 33:53.797
[chuckles quietly]

33:56.135 --> 33:57.901
Don't tell me
you're not dying

33:57.936 --> 33:59.102
to find out
who yours is.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.103
I'm not.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.671
Why not?

34:01.707 --> 34:03.673
Because I have lousy luck
with Secret Santa.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.742
Last year, it was
Bill in accounting.

34:05.778 --> 34:06.955
He quit two days
before the party.

34:06.979 --> 34:09.157
And the year before that,
it was Kenny from the mailroom.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.481
He just re-gifted
his Secret Santa.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.483
It was a t-shirt that was
three sizes too large

34:13.518 --> 34:15.185
and it said
"I love mail."

34:15.219 --> 34:16.485
And then,
the year before,

34:16.522 --> 34:17.587
it was, um...

34:17.623 --> 34:20.791
[hushed]:
Betty the receptionist.

34:20.826 --> 34:24.795
She made me two pounds
of homemade peanut butter fudge.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.163
That doesn't
sound so bad.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.165
I'm allergic to nuts.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.000
Oh. That's a bummer.

34:30.034 --> 34:31.668
Anyway, you know what?
It's fine.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.003
I have always been
a bigger fan

34:33.038 --> 34:34.771
of giving than
receiving anyway.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.306
Well, no, look.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.308
If anybody deserves
a really great gift,

34:38.342 --> 34:39.509
it's you.

34:39.545 --> 34:41.777
I mean, the holidays
obviously mean a lot.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.447
To you.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.116
From your lips to my
Secret Santa's ears, I guess.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.150
Melanie?

34:47.186 --> 34:48.385
Yeah?

34:48.420 --> 34:49.630
Any progress
with the photographer?

34:49.655 --> 34:50.687
I'm on it.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.121
You know what,
I've called him

34:52.157 --> 34:53.190
five or six times.

34:53.225 --> 34:54.958
He's not getting
back to me.

34:54.993 --> 34:56.004
But I'm gonna
try him right now...

34:56.027 --> 34:58.662
[inhales sharply]
Uh, um...

34:59.998 --> 35:02.566
Um...

35:02.601 --> 35:04.468
Do you know what, actually?

35:04.503 --> 35:07.237
We're really busy with
the Evergreen Mobile pitch.

35:07.272 --> 35:10.006
I don't think I have time
to keep chasing him down.

35:10.042 --> 35:11.541
Oh.

35:11.577 --> 35:12.577
I'm sorry.

35:13.712 --> 35:14.544
It's okay.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.013
Do you know what?

35:17.049 --> 35:17.981
Never mind.
I can probably...

35:18.016 --> 35:19.661
Melanie, listen.
If you're busy, you're busy.

35:19.685 --> 35:22.119
I'll just get
Steve to do it.

35:23.222 --> 35:24.222
All right.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.058
[♪♪♪]

35:29.461 --> 35:30.461
All right.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.066
Hi.

35:36.101 --> 35:37.234
Hey! [Laughs]

35:37.269 --> 35:38.201
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

35:38.237 --> 35:39.269
I guess you caught me.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.103
I picked up
some gingerbread cookies

35:40.139 --> 35:42.372
cookies from
The North Pole Tree Farm.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.373
Have you ever heard of it?

35:43.408 --> 35:44.641
I have.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.421
Well, they always go fast when
I leave them in the breakroom,

35:46.445 --> 35:47.911
and you were
out of the office,

35:47.946 --> 35:49.079
so I saved you one!

35:49.114 --> 35:50.213
Thank you.

35:50.249 --> 35:52.382
You're welcome.

35:52.417 --> 35:53.717
By the way, nice tree.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.468
How's the Evergreen pitch
coming along?

36:00.492 --> 36:03.026
Good. Good, yeah.

36:03.061 --> 36:05.462
I think we've got
some really strong leads,

36:05.497 --> 36:06.508
I'm sure we'll gonna have
something very solid

36:06.532 --> 36:07.532
to present to you soon.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.799
Excellent. I have
the utmost faith in you both.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.434
Thank you.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.435
Before you leave,

36:12.471 --> 36:13.503
there's something else

36:13.539 --> 36:14.304
I'd like to discuss
with you.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.339
Okay.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.374
James Porter is retiring
at the end of the year,

36:17.409 --> 36:19.142
which means there's gonna be
an opening

36:19.178 --> 36:20.277
for Creative Director,

36:20.312 --> 36:22.546
and I'd like
to promote internally.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.447
Is that something
you'd be interested in?

36:24.483 --> 36:26.383
Yes. Uh, yes, sir.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.218
Yes. I would very much
like to be intere...

36:28.253 --> 36:29.386
I, um...

36:29.421 --> 36:30.353
I'm very interested in that!

36:30.389 --> 36:32.556
[laughs] Great. Great.
I'm glad to hear it.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.035
I think you'd be a great fit
for the position.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.992
You know, I've been
so impressed with your work

36:36.028 --> 36:37.827
over the past few years.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.496
Thank you.
Thank you.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.998
I'll be announcing my decision
at the Christmas party,

36:42.034 --> 36:44.868
so that gives you and Donovan
time to make your cases.

36:45.938 --> 36:47.103
Donovan?

36:47.139 --> 36:49.339
Yeah, he's one of the other
candidates we're looking at.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.876
Okay.

36:55.113 --> 36:57.981
Yeah, we've been writing
back and forth for a week.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.416
What do you mean?

36:59.451 --> 37:00.584
Oh, I took your advice.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.519
I set up a fake email account,

37:02.554 --> 37:03.998
so I could figure out
what he wants for Christmas.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.989
Okay, that was not my advice.

37:06.024 --> 37:07.724
Well, it was in the spirit
of your advice.

37:07.759 --> 37:11.261
Anyway, it just sort of
snowballed from there.

37:11.296 --> 37:14.831
Well, that's... unexpected.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.934
So, he doesn't
know it's you?

37:17.970 --> 37:20.170
Oh, it's complicated.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.504
Why's that?

37:21.540 --> 37:22.572
Well...

37:22.608 --> 37:24.708
in writing,

37:24.743 --> 37:26.409
he's sweet

37:26.445 --> 37:28.245
and funny, and...

37:28.280 --> 37:30.380
then, working on our project
together,

37:30.415 --> 37:34.017
we disagree on everything,
and... [sighs]

37:34.052 --> 37:36.019
Now we're up
for the same promotion.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.554
Creative Director?

37:37.589 --> 37:39.356
You've wanted
that forever!

37:39.391 --> 37:41.324
Yeah.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.394
Well, so how come
you're not more excited?

37:44.429 --> 37:46.963
No, no. I'm... I am excited.
[stammers]

37:46.999 --> 37:47.999
But...?

37:49.268 --> 37:51.868
You know, I think
it just caught me off-guard.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.070
I mean,
we were working together,

37:54.106 --> 37:55.472
you know?

37:55.507 --> 37:57.741
And now, suddenly,
he's the competition.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.342
Is that all?

38:00.912 --> 38:02.545
What else would it be?

38:02.581 --> 38:04.881
Are you really
gonna make me say it?

38:04.916 --> 38:06.883
What?

38:06.918 --> 38:09.252
Melly... you like him.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.222
[laughs]
Of course, I like him.

38:12.257 --> 38:13.957
He's a nice guy.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.258
I don't think
this has to do

38:15.294 --> 38:16.926
with a Secret Santa anymore.

38:18.497 --> 38:20.230
You're falling
for this guy.

38:20.265 --> 38:22.732
That's...

38:22.768 --> 38:25.635
not... true.

38:25.671 --> 38:27.103
Are you sure?

38:28.507 --> 38:31.041
[♪♪♪]

38:32.477 --> 38:34.144
[knocks] Mr. Farnsworth?

38:34.179 --> 38:35.612
Can I speak
to you, please?

38:35.647 --> 38:36.813
Sure, Donovan.
Come on in.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.283
Perhaps I misunderstood,

38:40.319 --> 38:41.418
but I thought I was a lock

38:41.453 --> 38:43.853
on the Creative Director
position.

38:43.889 --> 38:46.623
You mentioned that to me when
I first started at the agency.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.459
But I've been hearing that
there are multiple candidates.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.105
Donovan, I really value
your work here at the firm.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.129
It's great.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.697
Very well-researched.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.699
And I continue to bring
high-profile clients.

38:55.734 --> 38:56.966
Yes, you do.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.002
So?

38:58.036 --> 39:01.171
So, I'm taking all of that
into consideration.

39:01.206 --> 39:04.107
Well, what can I do to show you
that I'm the one for the job?

39:04.142 --> 39:05.175
Donovan,

39:05.210 --> 39:07.677
you're very talented,

39:07.713 --> 39:09.446
but this isn't a solo sport.

39:09.481 --> 39:10.681
We win and lose here
as a team.

39:10.716 --> 39:12.382
Take Melanie, for example.

39:12.417 --> 39:13.383
She makes the effort

39:13.418 --> 39:15.952
to get to know the people
she's working with,

39:15.987 --> 39:17.954
and make herself
a part of that team.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.823
As a result,
people come to her.

39:21.326 --> 39:22.892
Is Melanie
one of the other candidates?

39:22.928 --> 39:23.960
Yes, she is.

39:25.430 --> 39:28.064
Look, Donovan,
you've got lots of time

39:28.100 --> 39:30.300
to show me you can be
a team player.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.104
Thank you.

39:38.677 --> 39:39.542
Don't forget!

39:39.578 --> 39:41.978
Meet up tonight
at Harbor Point rink.

39:42.013 --> 39:42.979
Who's coming?

39:43.014 --> 39:44.080
I'm in!

39:44.116 --> 39:45.014
Me too.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.850
- Carpool?
- Yeah, sure.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.485
I'd like to come.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.987
You mean you're actually gonna
come hang out after work?

39:51.022 --> 39:52.055
Voluntarily?

39:52.090 --> 39:54.391
Sure.
Sounds like fun.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.259
Since when
does he like fun?

39:56.294 --> 39:57.594
Wonderful! Okay, everyone.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.796
Meet at the rink
in an hour.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.833
I guess
I'll see you there.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.668
See you there.

40:05.704 --> 40:08.138
[♪♪♪]

40:15.747 --> 40:16.713
You know, I think

40:16.748 --> 40:19.015
the last time I went skating
was in high school.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.216
Really?

40:20.252 --> 40:21.951
Yeah, but it's like
riding a bike, right?

40:21.987 --> 40:23.398
It all comes back to you
once you're out there?

40:23.422 --> 40:25.722
Totally. You just got
to shake off the dust.

40:25.757 --> 40:29.225
Okay. So do you think
he's really gonna show?

40:30.395 --> 40:31.728
Well, he said
he'd be here.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.097
Why the sudden urge
to mingle, I wonder?

40:34.132 --> 40:35.732
I may have
suggested it.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.534
What did you say?

40:37.569 --> 40:38.935
I just said that

40:38.970 --> 40:41.070
if he took the time to get
to know his coworkers,

40:41.106 --> 40:43.973
he might discover that
he actually likes them.

40:44.009 --> 40:46.576
Wait. Did you suggest it,
or Secret Santa?

40:46.611 --> 40:48.044
Both, I guess.

40:48.079 --> 40:49.879
[chuckles] Well...

40:49.915 --> 40:54.184
it looks like you two
are pretty persuasive.

40:55.454 --> 40:57.954
All right. Any final advice
before we hit the rink?

40:57.989 --> 40:59.956
Um, just go out
and have fun.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.058
Oh, and don't forget
the, uh, toe-pick.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.726
Ah. Oh, here he comes.

41:03.762 --> 41:04.594
- Act natural.
- [Donovan]: Hi, ladies.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.629
Hi.

41:07.766 --> 41:09.899
Mr. Farnsworth.

41:09.935 --> 41:12.068
Donovan! Glad
you could make it tonight.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.437
It's good to see you.

41:14.473 --> 41:16.806
Thought I'd give
this a whirl.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.942
You know, I appreciate
the feedback,

41:18.977 --> 41:20.588
and the chance to show you
that I can change.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.412
Oh, no problem, Donovan.

41:22.447 --> 41:24.647
I want to make sure
that you get every advantage.

41:24.683 --> 41:26.182
I appreciate that.

41:26.218 --> 41:28.318
You much of a skater?

41:28.353 --> 41:30.954
Not even a little.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.355
[chuckles]

41:32.390 --> 41:33.590
I'll see you out there.

41:34.793 --> 41:36.659
Can't wait.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.330
[♪♪♪]

42:03.221 --> 42:04.354
Hi, Donovan.

42:04.389 --> 42:06.856
Hi, Melanie.

42:06.892 --> 42:09.259
Uh, are you just gonna watch,
or are you gonna skate?

42:10.529 --> 42:12.328
Oh, I'm just taking it all in.

42:12.364 --> 42:14.163
Ah.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.331
Well, it's been awhile?

42:15.367 --> 42:17.133
A long while.

42:17.168 --> 42:18.501
As in, never.

42:18.537 --> 42:21.337
[laughs]

42:21.373 --> 42:22.839
What?

42:22.874 --> 42:25.408
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
I just, um...

42:25.443 --> 42:27.911
I don't think I've ever seen you
this laid-back.

42:27.946 --> 42:30.480
Oh, I thought
that a suit and a tie

42:30.515 --> 42:32.348
might be a little bit formal
for the rink.

42:32.384 --> 42:34.984
Well, it's really nice
to have you here.

42:35.020 --> 42:37.220
Yeah, well, trying
to open myself up

42:37.255 --> 42:39.322
to new opportunities.

42:39.357 --> 42:41.824
A friend thought
it would be a good idea.

42:41.860 --> 42:43.826
Smart friend.

42:43.862 --> 42:46.529
Yeah. She is.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.599
Hey, Melanie.

42:49.634 --> 42:53.202
Was skating
as the office activity,

42:53.238 --> 42:54.270
was that your idea?

42:54.306 --> 42:56.706
Uh, no.
No, it wasn't.

43:00.378 --> 43:02.612
So do you want to...

43:02.647 --> 43:03.913
do you wanna give it a shot?

43:05.050 --> 43:06.015
Yeah.

43:06.051 --> 43:07.684
Do you need a lesson?

43:07.719 --> 43:08.851
Yes.

43:08.887 --> 43:09.887
Okay.

43:12.557 --> 43:15.425
[♪♪♪]

43:30.609 --> 43:32.275
[exhales heavily]

43:32.310 --> 43:34.143
Hey, Alicia.

43:34.179 --> 43:36.145
Hey!

43:36.181 --> 43:37.981
That is a lot of work.

43:38.016 --> 43:40.049
No kidding!
You got some moves.

43:40.085 --> 43:42.785
Yeah, I think
I found my new sport.

43:42.821 --> 43:45.421
Was ice skating your idea?

43:45.457 --> 43:46.457
It was.

43:46.491 --> 43:48.825
It's one of my favorite
things to do at Christmas.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.226
Me and my family
go every year.

43:50.261 --> 43:51.961
Kinda puts us
into the holiday spirit.

43:51.997 --> 43:53.062
That's great.

43:53.098 --> 43:54.163
Anyway...

43:54.199 --> 43:56.265
See you
back at the office.

43:56.301 --> 43:57.367
- Yeah. See ya.
- Bye.

44:05.443 --> 44:07.443
[Donovan, writing]

44:12.283 --> 44:14.884
[chuckles]

44:19.491 --> 44:20.657
Is that right?

44:20.692 --> 44:23.459
Well, you saw me out there.

44:23.495 --> 44:24.961
What are your scores?

44:31.002 --> 44:33.102
[chuckles]

44:36.441 --> 44:38.374
[laughs]

44:42.213 --> 44:44.781
I am.

44:49.154 --> 44:52.155
Well, I've wanted to ask this
for a while...

45:03.334 --> 45:06.869
<i>...And my dad...</i>

45:06.905 --> 45:10.006
<i>he was never
much for holidays.</i>

45:10.041 --> 45:13.376
<i>He's a lawyer,
very successful.</i>

45:13.411 --> 45:15.311
<i>I can't remember
a single Christmas</i>

45:15.346 --> 45:17.346
<i>he didn't spend in the office.</i>

45:20.652 --> 45:24.353
He was disappointed
when I turned down law school.

45:25.590 --> 45:27.757
I'm sorry.

45:41.272 --> 45:43.773

46:04.729 --> 46:07.330
[bells jingling]

46:16.441 --> 46:17.907
Merry Christmas.

46:19.778 --> 46:22.211
[♪♪♪]

46:24.816 --> 46:26.949
[Jude]: Thanks again for
offering to take him

46:26.985 --> 46:28.785
to the North Pole
Tree Farm today.

46:28.820 --> 46:31.187
He has been talking
about it non-stop.

46:31.222 --> 46:32.722
My pleasure.
You know what?

46:32.757 --> 46:35.391
I think I'm just as excited
about it as he is.

46:35.426 --> 46:36.859
So how goes the hunt

46:36.895 --> 46:38.594
for the perfect
Secret Santa gift?

46:38.630 --> 46:41.063
Oh, uh, not good.

46:41.099 --> 46:42.099
Still haven't
figured out

46:42.133 --> 46:43.133
what to get him?

46:43.168 --> 46:44.100
No, I have no clue.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.135
But you spent the last week
with the guy.

46:46.171 --> 46:47.581
You must have gotten
to know him pretty well.

46:47.605 --> 46:49.372
He's an early-riser.

46:49.407 --> 46:51.974
He does not like sugar
in his coffee.

46:52.010 --> 46:55.111
He's stubborn,
but fair.

46:55.146 --> 46:58.347
And he's a horrible skater,
but refuses to admit it.

46:59.584 --> 47:02.718
Hey, hey! Not so fast
with that scarf!

47:02.754 --> 47:04.231
- Come here.
- But the snowman needs a scarf!

47:04.255 --> 47:06.122
No, he's not getting
yours. Come here.

47:07.859 --> 47:09.392
Aw, but he'll be cold.

47:09.427 --> 47:11.394
No, you'll be cold!

47:11.429 --> 47:13.963
You know what, Zach?
I think green's his color.

47:13.998 --> 47:14.897
Thanks, Auntie Mel.

47:14.933 --> 47:16.098
Welcome.

47:16.134 --> 47:18.968
Melly, it's gonna be
in the teens today.

47:19.003 --> 47:21.103
Aw... Worth it.

47:23.708 --> 47:25.141
Nice!

47:25.176 --> 47:29.111
[♪♪♪]

47:33.117 --> 47:35.918
I'm looking for some
snowflake-shaped earrings.

47:35.954 --> 47:36.964
You had them here
the other day.

47:36.988 --> 47:38.654
I'm sorry.

47:38.690 --> 47:39.856
I sold those
this morning.

47:39.891 --> 47:42.191
But I can show you
something else.

47:42.227 --> 47:45.261
We have a lot of
very festive jewelry.

47:45.296 --> 47:47.463
I had my heart set on those,
but, thank you.

47:48.566 --> 47:49.832
Oh!

47:49.868 --> 47:50.933
Hi.

47:50.969 --> 47:52.435
Hi! I didn't expect
to see you here,

47:52.470 --> 47:54.136
of all places...

47:54.172 --> 47:56.339
I had a craving
for those gingerbread cookies.

47:56.374 --> 47:58.441
I told you so!

47:58.476 --> 47:59.308
Auntie Mel!

47:59.344 --> 48:01.344
Can I get my picture
taken with Santa?

48:01.379 --> 48:03.145
Yes, of course, you can.

48:03.181 --> 48:05.047
Mr. Donovan, do you
want to see him, too?

48:05.083 --> 48:06.727
- Oh, no, that's fine, no...
- You can tag along.

48:06.751 --> 48:07.683
If you want.

48:07.719 --> 48:09.479
You can tell him
what you want for Christmas!

48:10.488 --> 48:11.787
Okay.

48:11.823 --> 48:13.556
Okay...

48:13.591 --> 48:14.969
I've been really good
this year, Santa!

48:14.993 --> 48:15.791
Did you get my list?

48:15.827 --> 48:17.037
Why not make this
a family photo?

48:17.061 --> 48:18.127
Everyone squeeze in.

48:18.162 --> 48:19.306
- Oh, no...
- No, we're not the...

Come on, Mr. Donovan!

Do you mind?

48:24.669 --> 48:25.669
- Sure.
- Okay.

48:27.372 --> 48:29.005
All right, everybody!

48:29.040 --> 48:30.840
Let's say
"candy canes!"

48:35.413 --> 48:36.879
Can I have
some quarters?

48:36.915 --> 48:40.216
Oh, sure you can.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.918
Uh, do you know what?

48:41.953 --> 48:44.253
I think
I'm all out of quarters.

48:44.289 --> 48:46.689
Oh, wait.
I should have some.

48:46.724 --> 48:47.823
Oh.

48:47.859 --> 48:49.425
Yeah, here.
Here you go, Zach.

48:49.460 --> 48:50.526
Thanks.

48:50.561 --> 48:51.661
You're welcome.

48:51.696 --> 48:54.330
Thank you.

48:54.365 --> 48:57.433
Okay, wait. Oh, wait.
One second. Gotta show you.

48:57.468 --> 48:58.512
You gotta hold your hand
out flat, like that.

48:58.536 --> 49:00.503
'Cause they're gonna nibble
right out of there.

49:00.538 --> 49:02.238
Have fun!

49:03.374 --> 49:04.840
You're so good with him.

49:04.876 --> 49:07.176
Oh, he makes it easy.

49:12.483 --> 49:14.583
You cold?

49:14.619 --> 49:16.385
Uh, a little.

49:16.421 --> 49:18.521
I gave my scarf
to a snowman.

49:18.556 --> 49:20.256
[laughs]

49:20.291 --> 49:21.390
Do I even need to ask?

49:21.426 --> 49:22.525
Nah, probably not.

49:22.560 --> 49:23.426
Here.

49:23.461 --> 49:24.627
What? Oh,
no, no, no, no.

49:24.662 --> 49:25.594
I'm totally fine.
Don't worry about it.

49:25.630 --> 49:26.562
You're shivering.

49:26.597 --> 49:27.597
Well...

49:30.935 --> 49:31.935
There.

49:31.970 --> 49:32.902
Thank you.

49:32.937 --> 49:33.937
Yeah.

49:35.440 --> 49:36.939
Auntie Mel!
Auntie Mel!

49:36.975 --> 49:38.474
Yes! Zach. Yeah?

49:38.509 --> 49:40.076
Can I make
an ornament?

49:40.111 --> 49:42.545
Of course you can.
Go on!

49:48.619 --> 49:49.785
[Melanie]: Thank you.

49:49.821 --> 49:52.388
Hey, did you know
that reindeer

49:52.423 --> 49:55.591
are the only mammals that can
see ultraviolet light?

49:55.626 --> 49:57.626
No. Is that how
they lead the sleigh?

49:57.662 --> 49:59.962
You know what.
I bet it is.

50:02.266 --> 50:04.100
Is that true?

50:04.135 --> 50:06.135
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I saw it
on a nature show.

50:06.170 --> 50:07.170
Wow.

50:07.205 --> 50:08.738
Yeah.

50:08.773 --> 50:11.073
Nice!

50:11.109 --> 50:12.975
Go for it.

50:14.145 --> 50:16.612
Oh! Hi.

50:16.647 --> 50:17.780
What's this?

50:17.815 --> 50:19.015
Our pitch.

50:19.050 --> 50:20.583
Our pitch?

50:20.618 --> 50:22.418
Yeah.

50:22.453 --> 50:24.920
When I went home yesterday,
it hit me.

50:24.956 --> 50:27.990
What does Santa's sleigh need
that an Evergreen phone has?

50:28.026 --> 50:29.859
I don't know.

50:29.894 --> 50:31.360
GPS!

50:31.396 --> 50:33.095
I've got the whole
script right there,

50:33.131 --> 50:34.430
and some mock-ups.

50:34.465 --> 50:35.331
Okay. Great.

50:35.366 --> 50:36.710
I'm gonna take
a look at it right now,

50:36.734 --> 50:37.600
and I'll get back
to you with notes.

50:37.635 --> 50:38.501
No need.

50:38.536 --> 50:41.270
Worked on it all night.
It is perfect.

50:41.305 --> 50:42.983
You don't think I should
at least give you some input?

50:43.007 --> 50:44.607
There's no time for that.

50:44.642 --> 50:46.308
Look, I tell you what.
Let me take point,

50:46.344 --> 50:48.811
and you can chime in
if you feel the need to,

50:48.846 --> 50:49.945
but I highly doubt it...

50:49.981 --> 50:52.114
I mean, this here?
Real winner.

50:52.150 --> 50:54.283
I already let Farnsworth know
we're coming by.

50:55.586 --> 50:57.820
Oh... um...

50:57.855 --> 51:00.289
Okay, yeah, I mean,
If you really think it's ready.

51:00.324 --> 51:02.992
Trust me.
He's gonna love it.

51:08.833 --> 51:10.299
I don't think this is the one.

51:10.334 --> 51:12.168
Sir, we have
only three days

51:12.203 --> 51:13.369
before we pitch
to O'Ryan.

51:13.404 --> 51:14.570
I think we should
run with it.

51:14.605 --> 51:17.506
Sorry. It's not a bad idea,
it's just missing something.

51:17.542 --> 51:19.175
We only get
one shot at this.

51:19.210 --> 51:21.477
So, we need...

51:21.512 --> 51:23.379
more.

51:23.414 --> 51:24.414
More what?

51:24.449 --> 51:26.315
More heart.

51:34.692 --> 51:36.692
We'll get there.

51:41.632 --> 51:42.665
Okay.

51:42.700 --> 51:45.167
[♪♪♪]

52:07.792 --> 52:09.158
[heavy sigh]

52:10.728 --> 52:12.294
What are you working on?

52:12.330 --> 52:13.996
Secret Santa.

52:14.031 --> 52:16.765
Got a few likes, a few dislikes,
from him, which is a start,

52:16.801 --> 52:18.434
but he's tough.

52:18.469 --> 52:19.602
You know, I thought...

52:19.637 --> 52:21.003
You know that cafe
that he goes to,

52:21.038 --> 52:22.972
where he works
all the time?

52:23.007 --> 52:25.808
Would it be too impersonal
to get him

52:25.843 --> 52:27.376
a gift card for coffee?

52:27.411 --> 52:28.544
Uh, yeah.

52:28.579 --> 52:30.813
Okay. Um, what about cookies?

52:30.848 --> 52:32.281
He doesn't eat sugar.
You know that!

52:32.316 --> 52:34.850
I know.

52:34.886 --> 52:36.986
What about a membership
to the astronomy club?

52:37.021 --> 52:38.021
Oh, he's coming!

52:41.893 --> 52:44.460
[♪♪♪]

52:46.898 --> 52:48.464
Dad.

52:48.499 --> 52:49.865
Donovan!

52:49.901 --> 52:52.067
What are you doing
in my neck of the woods?

52:52.103 --> 52:53.135
I saw
I missed your call,

52:53.171 --> 52:54.336
so I thought
I'd just come by.

52:54.372 --> 52:55.905
Are you busy?

52:55.940 --> 52:58.974
I'm on my way
to the courthouse.

52:59.010 --> 53:00.242
How've you been?

53:00.278 --> 53:03.445
Good. You know,
busy as usual.

53:05.883 --> 53:08.551
You, uh, do you have
any plans for Christmas?

53:08.586 --> 53:09.652
Ah, same as
every year.

53:09.687 --> 53:11.420
Work.

53:11.455 --> 53:14.390
Avoid the crowds
by Grand Central.

53:14.425 --> 53:15.991
Good time
to get caught up

53:16.027 --> 53:18.594
and get things done
when the office is quiet.

53:18.629 --> 53:20.329
Yeah.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.565
Yeah...

53:22.600 --> 53:24.200
There's something
I wanted to ask you...

53:24.235 --> 53:26.035
[phone ringing]

53:26.070 --> 53:27.469
Excuse me.

53:29.473 --> 53:32.174
Hello?

53:32.210 --> 53:33.709
What do you mean,
he's not there?

53:35.379 --> 53:37.580
Well, please do your best
to track him down.

53:37.615 --> 53:39.848
We have his deposition today.

53:39.884 --> 53:45.054
I'm sorry.
It's been like this all day.

53:45.089 --> 53:46.222
It's okay.

53:46.257 --> 53:48.068
It's been a pretty busy
few weeks at work for me, too.

53:48.092 --> 53:50.359
I'm working on
a big account.

53:50.394 --> 53:51.860
Evergreen Mobile.

53:51.896 --> 53:54.029
The CEO has
one heck of a poker face,

53:54.065 --> 53:55.264
but...

53:55.299 --> 53:56.765
when we bring him
back in,

53:56.801 --> 53:57.811
I think I can sell him
on our vision.

53:57.835 --> 54:00.636
You always were
very persuasive.

54:00.671 --> 54:02.204
Your mother used to say

54:02.240 --> 54:03.872
that you could sell
a red popsicle

54:03.908 --> 54:05.241
to a woman
with white gloves...

54:05.276 --> 54:06.242
...On the fourth
of July.

54:06.277 --> 54:07.443
[laughing]

54:08.613 --> 54:10.913
You would have made
a fine attorney.

54:13.618 --> 54:15.251
I don't think so.

54:15.286 --> 54:16.252
Of course,
you would have.

54:16.287 --> 54:18.153
It's in your blood.

54:18.189 --> 54:20.222
Three generations
of litigators.

54:20.258 --> 54:22.224
Four, now,
with your sister.

54:22.260 --> 54:23.292
Did she tell you

54:23.327 --> 54:24.393
that she's arguing

54:24.428 --> 54:25.761
two cases before

54:25.796 --> 54:27.596
the California Supreme
Court this year?

54:27.632 --> 54:29.164
Very influential.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.934
No. She didn't
mention that.

54:31.969 --> 54:34.570
All I'm saying is I think
you missed your calling.

54:34.605 --> 54:36.405
No. No, Dad. I didn't.

54:38.776 --> 54:41.810
I'm sorry
I don't have more time.

54:41.846 --> 54:43.479
What was it
you wanted to ask me?

54:43.514 --> 54:45.614
It's not important.

54:45.650 --> 54:48.484
I'll see you later, Dad.

54:53.824 --> 54:55.791
I knew the pitch
was off.

54:55.826 --> 54:59.295
I should've insisted
on looking it over

54:59.330 --> 55:00.296
before we went in there.

55:00.331 --> 55:01.497
So why didn't you?

55:01.532 --> 55:03.632
Because he got so excited.

55:03.668 --> 55:06.769
You know, I didn't want to take
the wind out of his sails.

55:06.804 --> 55:09.772
Melly... his sails
are your sails.

55:09.807 --> 55:11.373
You're supposed to
be a team, right?

55:11.409 --> 55:12.441
Yeah.

55:12.476 --> 55:14.677
So why are you sitting
on the bench for this one?

55:14.712 --> 55:16.312
Was that a sports reference?

55:16.347 --> 55:18.414
My husband's influence.

55:19.717 --> 55:21.216
Speaking of...

55:21.252 --> 55:22.651
Hot chocolate's
getting cold.

55:22.687 --> 55:23.852
Thank you. Sorry.

55:23.888 --> 55:25.554
Bedtime stories
ran a little long.

55:25.589 --> 55:27.723
Got you to read it
twice, did he?

55:27.758 --> 55:28.691
Sure did.

55:28.726 --> 55:30.059
What did I miss?

55:30.094 --> 55:33.128
Oh, just work trouble.

55:33.164 --> 55:35.208
That Christmas account
still throwing you for a loop?

55:35.232 --> 55:38.467
Yeah. You got any advice?

55:38.502 --> 55:39.980
I don't know if I can
give you any advice,

55:40.004 --> 55:42.338
but maybe
an early Christmas gift?

55:44.542 --> 55:46.508
What?

55:46.544 --> 55:49.044
Here you go.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.679
[laughing]

55:50.715 --> 55:51.715
Guys!

55:53.017 --> 55:54.783
Oh, my goodness.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.219
This is amazing.

55:58.856 --> 56:02.124
A must-have
for a new creative executive.

56:03.561 --> 56:06.428
Guys, it's beautiful.

56:06.464 --> 56:09.198
[chuckles]

56:09.233 --> 56:11.266
But I don't have the promotion.

56:11.302 --> 56:12.568
"Yet."

56:12.603 --> 56:13.902
Knock 'em dead, Melly.

56:16.741 --> 56:18.173
Why don't we save it?

56:21.045 --> 56:23.212

56:23.247 --> 56:25.567
[Donovan, writing]: <i>I've worked
so hard to get where I am.</i>

56:29.220 --> 56:30.319
Tsk.

56:41.932 --> 56:44.633
Maybe instead of focusing
on your differences,

56:44.668 --> 56:47.536
you need to find
some common ground.

56:47.571 --> 56:50.005
What's something
you both like to do?

57:09.093 --> 57:11.427
I begged her to sign me up
for all the dance classes.

57:11.462 --> 57:13.295
It had been her dream,

57:13.330 --> 57:16.064
and then,
suddenly, it was mine.

57:20.004 --> 57:23.839
About halfway through
my first year at Juilliard...

57:23.874 --> 57:27.075
I realized
that I just didn't love it.

57:32.516 --> 57:35.651
<i>Do you know
what she said?</i>

57:35.686 --> 57:37.953
She told me

57:37.988 --> 57:42.524
that the only thing
that she's ever wanted me to be

57:42.560 --> 57:44.460
was happy.

57:44.495 --> 57:46.261
[hits key]

57:50.534 --> 57:51.667
Thank you.

58:06.484 --> 58:07.950

58:10.521 --> 58:12.287
Anytime.

58:13.257 --> 58:15.491
On a lighter note...

58:15.526 --> 58:16.959
I was wondering

58:16.994 --> 58:18.994
if there is
any Christmas activity

58:19.029 --> 58:20.762
you haven't done?

58:29.206 --> 58:31.473
[laughing] Really?

58:31.509 --> 58:33.308
I have a hard time
believing that.

58:33.344 --> 58:34.409
Meow!

58:34.445 --> 58:36.645
Oh! Okay.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.847
Okay. I'm feeding you.

58:40.684 --> 58:42.451
Okay.

58:46.023 --> 58:48.690
[♪♪♪]

59:05.276 --> 59:07.242
So, Donovan
wants to meet.

59:07.278 --> 59:08.076
You've already met.

59:08.112 --> 59:11.046
He wants to meet
his Secret Santa.

59:11.081 --> 59:12.347
That seems like cheating.

59:12.383 --> 59:14.249
The party's still
two weeks away.

59:14.285 --> 59:15.695
Yeah, but you know what,
maybe it's time I tell him.

59:15.719 --> 59:18.520
We've gotten
really close,

59:18.556 --> 59:20.355
and it feels wrong
to keep it from him.

59:20.391 --> 59:22.190
Okay, so tell him.

59:22.226 --> 59:25.127
Yes, I would,
it's just...

59:25.162 --> 59:26.762
Just what?

59:26.797 --> 59:29.464
This is gonna sound
really silly, but...

59:29.500 --> 59:31.767
What we have
behind the screen

59:31.802 --> 59:33.468
is really special,

59:33.504 --> 59:37.439
and I'm worried that
he'll be disappointed.

59:37.474 --> 59:39.074
Why would he
be disappointed?

59:39.109 --> 59:40.742
He obviously likes you.

59:40.778 --> 59:42.277
He likes
his Secret Santa.

59:42.313 --> 59:43.779
And you are
his Secret Santa.

59:43.814 --> 59:46.548
Yes, but he doesn't
know that.

59:46.584 --> 59:48.951
I think I've just let it
go on for too long.

59:48.986 --> 59:50.252
This started out

59:50.287 --> 59:52.387
as just a way to get
to know him better,

59:52.423 --> 59:54.223
and now he's told me all
these personal things

59:54.258 --> 59:57.159
about himself
and his family,

59:57.194 --> 59:59.895
and, I mean, how's
he gonna react

59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.463
when he finds out
it's me?

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:02.564
Just tell him, Mel.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.600
What's the worst
that could happen?

Hi.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.433
Um...

01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:39.846
Uh, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.703
Uh, I know.

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:43.438
You do?

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:45.273
Well, it's pretty
obvious to me.

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.175
It is?

01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:48.176
You're nervous
about the pitch.

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:49.244
What?

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:50.212
But you don't
have to be.

01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:51.247
Oh?

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.180
I've got
a handle on it.

01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:55.283
Three new ideas
they'd be crazy to pass up.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:57.419
I'm about to take them
to Farnsworth.

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:59.054
No.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:00.922
No?

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:04.459
[sighing] Donovan,
this whole time...

01:01:04.495 --> 01:01:06.461
I've let you take the lead.

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:09.097
But, um...

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:12.401
I want a say now,
I want a real say.

01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:15.737
You're standing your ground?

01:01:15.773 --> 01:01:18.340
Yes. I am.

01:01:19.643 --> 01:01:21.523
This is only going to work
if we do it together.

01:01:25.082 --> 01:01:26.082
Okay.

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:29.017
Together.

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:33.055
Together.

01:01:36.427 --> 01:01:37.893
Okay!

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:40.073
Um, I brought
some magazines

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:41.129
for inspiration,

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:42.130
they're in that bag
over there.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:43.732
Do you mind
grabbing them?

01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:45.701
Sure.

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:48.603
What's this?

01:01:48.639 --> 01:01:50.138
Oh, it's Zach's
Christmas present.

01:01:51.475 --> 01:01:53.675

at the top of his list.

That's it!

What's "it"?

[elated gasp]

01:02:04.755 --> 01:02:06.488

It's perfect.

01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:19.835
We start on a blizzard.

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:20.870
A six-year-old boy

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:21.803
looks through the window,

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:24.039
watching his father
braves the elements

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:26.007
as he clears the walkway.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.242
He watches,

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:29.144
and thinks of ways
to help his dad.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:31.413
Suddenly... an idea.

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:33.315
He races to his room,

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:35.417
he picks up paper and a crayon,

01:02:35.452 --> 01:02:37.219
and begins to write.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:40.923
But then...

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:44.159
He notices
the calendar on the wall.

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:46.005
All the red "X" s show
there's only two days left

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:47.095
until Christmas.

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:48.697
He looks back down
at his letter,

01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:51.032
realizing it's not gonna
get there in time.

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:52.148
How's he gonna reach Santa?

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:55.003
The A5 Evergreen cellphone.

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:56.449
[Donovan]:
Out of earshot of his parents,

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:58.206
he calls the operator,

01:02:58.242 --> 01:03:00.108
asks for the number
to Santa's Workshop.

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:02.577
Cut to... Christmas morning.

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:05.747
Little boy races towards
the biggest gift under the tree

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:07.516
He plucks the card from it.

01:03:07.551 --> 01:03:08.884
It reads...

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:12.587
"To Billy's dad, from Santa."

01:03:12.623 --> 01:03:14.956
Beaming with excitement,
he hands the card to his dad.

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:16.358
He tears off the paper,

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:20.295
revealing
a brand-new snowblower.

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:23.732
His father laughs, touched,
gives his son a hug.

01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:26.234
And then
we cut to your logo,

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:29.070
with stylish script above
that reads...

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:31.673
"From our family to yours..."

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.544
"...Merry Christmas."

01:03:37.414 --> 01:03:40.782
[♪♪♪]

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.685
I love it.

01:03:44.822 --> 01:03:45.787
It's exactly right.

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:47.122
Great work.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.123
[Farnsworth]:
I couldn't agree more.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:50.158
Do you think you can
have this in production

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:51.204
and ready to go
for Christmas week?

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:52.505
[Farnsworth]: Absolutely.
Let's go to my office.

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:53.762
We'll discuss
the details.

01:03:53.797 --> 01:03:56.064
Perfect.

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:57.232
Nice work.

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:59.067
[both]: Thank you.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.270
What?

01:04:02.306 --> 01:04:03.271
Come here!

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.440
Sorry. Sorry.

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:07.187
- That's okay. That's okay.
- You were incredible!

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:08.521
I mean, I can't believe
we just did that!

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:09.611
Good work, partner.

01:04:09.646 --> 01:04:10.579
You too, partner.

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:13.215
[♪♪♪]

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:17.519
Hey!

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:18.520
Hey.

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.155
Heard about
the Evergreen pitch.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.590
Congratulations.

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:23.859
Thanks. Can I
walk you out?

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:26.461
Sure.

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:28.029
This calls
for celebration!

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:29.798
Ooh! Hot chocolate on me.

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:31.933
Sure, yeah.

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:34.135
Oh... you know what?

01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:36.304
I forgot my phone
back at the office.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:38.284
I am just gonna go run get it,
but I'll meet you back here.

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:39.207
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:40.175
Hey. Um...

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:42.477
I think I must've
walked two miles last night,

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:43.879
going tree lot to tree lot,

01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:45.513
but I finally
found the perfect one.

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:48.116
It's just the right height,
it has nice, full branches,

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:49.784
and I am babbling.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.520
Sorry. I just really
love Christmas.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:53.622
I'll admit.

01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:55.490
It's winning me over.

01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:56.625
You have plans tonight?

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:58.793
No. I am free.

01:04:58.829 --> 01:05:00.562
Would you maybe
want to grab dinner?

01:05:00.597 --> 01:05:01.796
I'd love to.

01:05:01.832 --> 01:05:03.331
Great.

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:13.208
[dejected sigh]

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:16.878
Thank you.

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:31.326
[Melanie's voice]

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:40.702
[phone ringing]

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:43.705
Andrew Goodwin's office.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.374
Yeah, hi. I'd like to speak
to Andrew, please.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:48.009
This is his son. Donovan.

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:49.110
[excited]:
<i>Donovan!</i>

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:51.279
It's so nice to finally
match a voice to the name.

01:05:51.315 --> 01:05:52.380
Excuse me?

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:53.581
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.762
It's just I've heard so much
about you from Mr. Goodwin.

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:57.252
He talks about me?

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:00.121
Oh, non-stop.
I feel like I know you.

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:02.123
<i>Mr. Goodwin is in a meeting
across town.</i>

01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:03.959
Would you like me
to tell him you called?

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:05.961
Yeah. Yeah, please.

01:06:05.996 --> 01:06:08.063
Thank you.

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:10.565
Hi.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.401
Hi.

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:15.103
Are those for me?

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.705
Oh. Right.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.640
Right. Yes.

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:20.942
Thank you.
They're beautiful.

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:22.110
You're welcome.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:23.623
Well, if we want to make
the reservation,

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:24.724
we should probably get going.

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:26.414
Lead the way.

01:06:27.517 --> 01:06:30.118
Okay.

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:39.661
Maybe I just
misread the situation.

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:41.296
I mean,
they're just emails.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.098
Maybe he was
just being friendly.

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:45.166
Well, that doesn't
sound like him at all,

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:47.635
Maybe if he knew
you were the one that sent them,

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.137
he'd feel
differently.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.272
You know, you should've
seen them together, though.

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:53.908
He looked so happy.

01:06:53.944 --> 01:06:55.254
I mean, you remember
what he was like

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:56.522
when he first came
to the agency.

01:06:56.546 --> 01:06:58.346
"Frosty the Snowman."

01:06:58.382 --> 01:07:00.815
And he's opened up so much.

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:02.250
Because of you.

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:04.853
But, you know what,
if-if he's happy with her,

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:06.321
then I don't want to spoil that.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.323
It's his loss, Mel.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:09.524
That's what
I keep saying,

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:10.925
and you can
do better.

01:07:10.961 --> 01:07:12.293
The fireman
still has your number.

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:13.495
Well...

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:14.496
There's a fireman?

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:16.131
He is so handsome!

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:18.466
I think...
I have a picture.

01:07:20.303 --> 01:07:22.003
Oh...

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:23.039
He is!

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:24.472
Okay, guys...

01:07:24.508 --> 01:07:26.219
Come on. I think this
could be good for you.

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:29.110
When was the last time
you had a really great date?

01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:30.979
I'm not looking
for a really great date.

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:34.682
I'm looking for a really great,
genuine connection.

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:36.818
Like the kind you had
with Donovan?

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:39.120
Well, I... [sighs]

01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:41.256
[chuckles sadly]

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.660
I just really like him...
you know?

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:49.397
And I thought, for a minute,

01:07:49.433 --> 01:07:51.833
that maybe
he felt the same way about me.

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:53.668
I'm sorry, Melly.

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:55.804
[sighs]

01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:57.872
It's okay.

01:07:57.908 --> 01:07:59.374
You know what, guys?
It's fine.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.443
It just...
It isn't meant to be.

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:08.149
I had a really
nice time tonight.

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:09.717
Me too.

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:12.320
I've actually been meaning
to do this for a while.

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:13.822
Really?

01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:16.558
Yeah. I just never had
the nerve to ask you.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:17.992
Well, it's a good thing

01:08:18.028 --> 01:08:19.727
you drew me
as your Secret Santa.

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:21.328
Secret Santa?

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:25.433
Yeah. Yeah, I kind of
pieced it all together.

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:28.036
I'm not
your Secret Santa.

01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:29.871
You're not?

01:08:29.906 --> 01:08:32.874
No. I have Tracey.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:33.908
Oh.

Well, you two really

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:50.658
knocked it out of
the park with this one.

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:52.760
We make
a great team.

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:54.362
Yes. We do.

01:08:54.397 --> 01:08:55.863
To many more campaigns.

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:57.532

Good work, Melanie.

01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:02.770
You too.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.671
Oh, my gosh, that
was awesome! Congrats!

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.640
Thank you.

01:09:08.078 --> 01:09:10.578
[indistinct exchange]

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.013
Sorry, Mel.

01:09:12.048 --> 01:09:14.381
It's okay.

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:18.019
That was something
really special.

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:20.622
So full of heart.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:22.023
Yeah...
that's all Melanie.

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.763
I was beginning
to wonder why

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:30.165
we never had
that second date.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.868
Guess I got my answer.

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:36.770
Oh, no.
It's not like that, really.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.406
Are you sure?

01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:42.743
[♪♪♪]

01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:54.288
So, something
just occurred to me.

01:09:54.324 --> 01:09:55.657
What if the reason

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.992
Donovan is suddenly
so cozy with Alicia

01:09:58.028 --> 01:09:58.960
is because he thinks

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:01.429
she's the one
he's been talking to online.

01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:02.330
What makes you think that?

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:03.464
I don't know.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.744
You threw him
off the trail early

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:06.601
and sent him
on a wild-goose chase.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:08.503
So, he found the wrong goose.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.505
Maybe...

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.441
or maybe he just likes her.

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:15.009
Maybe.

01:10:15.045 --> 01:10:17.412
Maybe, instead of
playing Secret Santa,

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:21.082
I just played Cupid.

- Hey.
- There you are.

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:35.196
I was wondering if you maybe
wanted to grab dinner tonight,

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:36.531
before the party,
to celebrate?

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:38.333

I'm meeting Jude.

You are going to the party,
though, tonight, right?

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:44.105
Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.840

I'll see you there.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.775
Yep.

Do you have
the print mock-up?

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:50.856
I told Farnsworth
I'd give it to him

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.846
before we left tonight

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:52.814
Yes. It's-It's on my desk.

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:54.048
Okay. Thanks.

Oh, thank you.

01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:36.224
It's from my son.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:40.061
[♪♪♪]

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:47.435
Okay, the cavalry
has arrived,

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.003
so let's get you ready.

01:11:49.039 --> 01:11:50.571
Yeah. [Sighs]

01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:53.241
You don't
sound excited.

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:54.742
This is one of
your favorite nights

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:55.677
of the year.

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:58.246
Yeah, but it's also
the Secret Santa reveal.

01:11:58.281 --> 01:12:00.748
So, in a few hours,
Donovan's gonna know

01:12:00.784 --> 01:12:02.450
that he's been
talking to me,

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:04.218
and that I've been
pretending

01:12:04.254 --> 01:12:05.286
to be somebody else.

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:07.422
I am sure he'll understand.

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:09.857
[exhales deeply]
I hope so.

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:12.226
It had to come out
eventually, Melly.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.596
You can't hide behind
a screen forever.

01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:17.165
You're right.

01:12:18.268 --> 01:12:19.567
Yes. You're right.
Mm-hmm.

01:12:19.602 --> 01:12:21.769
It'll be fine.
I promise.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:22.670
'Kay.

01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:25.273
Now, let's get you
looking fabulous, okay?

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:26.541
Okay.

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:27.875
Okay. Yeah.

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:38.553
Thank you.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.290
Dad.

01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:43.791
Hey.

01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:45.159
I got you a coffee.

01:12:45.195 --> 01:12:46.260
Cream, two sugars,
right?

01:12:46.296 --> 01:12:47.362
Yeah,
you've got it.

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:52.133
Um... thank you

01:12:52.168 --> 01:12:53.468
for meeting me here.

01:12:55.305 --> 01:12:56.537
There's...

01:12:56.573 --> 01:12:59.140
[sighs] ...something I've been
wanting to talk to you about.

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:00.341
What is it?

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:02.543
Um...

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:07.482
It bothers me when you say
I've missed my calling.

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:09.450
I know
you're disappointed

01:13:09.486 --> 01:13:10.918
that I didn't
become a lawyer,

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:12.820
but I love what I do,

01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:15.456
and I'm very good at it.

01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:17.336
When I say you would have
been a brilliant lawyer,

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.293
I mean it as a compliment.

01:13:19.329 --> 01:13:21.462
I guess, selfishly,

01:13:21.498 --> 01:13:24.432
I had hoped that it would
be something we could share.

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:27.535
I'm... I'm sorry
if I made you believe

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.070
I didn't respect
your decision.

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:32.440
Do you?

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:34.008
Of course I do.

01:13:35.245 --> 01:13:37.011
I'm very proud
of the man you've become.

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:39.147
I'm very proud of you.

01:13:39.182 --> 01:13:40.448
Really?

01:13:40.483 --> 01:13:42.650
Yes, son. I am.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.259
I've also been thinking
a lot about Christmas.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.229
I'd like to spend it together
as a family.

01:13:55.265 --> 01:13:56.798
Well, after all these years,

01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:58.966
I-I just didn't think
it was that important to you.

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:00.246
These last few weeks
have really showed me

01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:01.235
what I've been missing.

01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:04.138
Dad, I want us
to be closer.

01:14:04.174 --> 01:14:06.040
You, me, Caitlin.

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:07.041
[chuckles]

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:08.676
I would love that.

01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:10.511
You have your own life
and Caitlin has hers.

01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:12.313
I guess I just assumed

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:13.993
that you were okay
with the way things were.

01:14:14.017 --> 01:14:17.018
No. No, not anymore.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:20.721
You know, um,
when your mother died,

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:23.591
it was... it was easier to just
lock myself in the office,

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.893
focus on providing.

01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:28.863
But as I've... I've grown older,

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:31.599
I've come to regret
the time I lost with you both.

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:33.034
Let's not waste
anymore time.

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:35.136
Come over for Christmas.

01:14:36.206 --> 01:14:37.371
Okay.

01:14:37.407 --> 01:14:38.573
I called Caitlin.

01:14:38.608 --> 01:14:39.774
She's gonna fly in.

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:42.443
And just how did you manage
to pull her away from work?

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:44.045
[laughs]

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.081
I'm an ad man, Dad.
I can sell anything.

01:14:48.585 --> 01:14:50.451
Who's this?

01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:53.554
Oh...

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:56.290
This is Melanie.

01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:58.593
And just who is Melanie to you?

01:14:58.628 --> 01:15:00.394
[chuckles]
She's my Secret Santa.

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:12.607
[♪♪♪]

01:15:17.313 --> 01:15:19.380
It's a nice venue.

01:15:19.415 --> 01:15:21.048
Yeah.

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:23.618
[♪♪♪]

01:15:46.276 --> 01:15:47.508
Hi.

01:15:47.544 --> 01:15:49.076
Moment of truth.
You ready?

01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:51.512
Yes. Yes.
It's time to face the music.

01:15:51.548 --> 01:15:52.480
Okay.

01:15:52.515 --> 01:15:54.916
Worst-case scenario,
he's a little miffed,

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:56.161
and you two just go back
to being the way you were

01:15:56.185 --> 01:15:58.786
before all this
started.

01:15:58.821 --> 01:16:00.855
Like, back to when
we didn't talk at all, or...

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:02.323
when we were just coworkers

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:04.625
who made idle chit-chat
in the elevator?

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:09.697
I don't want
to go back to that,

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:12.333
and you know, I don't even
think that I could.

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:13.534
Well, lucky for you,

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.970
I'm betting on
the best-case scenario.

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:17.805
Which is?

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.273
You get everything you want.

01:16:19.309 --> 01:16:21.008
Everything?

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:22.343
You deserve it.

01:16:22.378 --> 01:16:23.778
You seem awfully confident

01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:25.279
that everything
is gonna work out.

01:16:25.315 --> 01:16:27.481
Of course I am.
It's Christmas.

01:16:27.517 --> 01:16:28.616
Now...

01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:30.651
which of these
do you think is mine?

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:38.259
Hi.

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:39.260
Hi.

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:41.195
Did you just get here?

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:42.296
No. I've been around.

01:16:42.332 --> 01:16:44.298
Oh.

01:16:44.334 --> 01:16:46.801
Did you come with Alicia?

01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:49.103
Alicia?

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:51.472
Yeah, um,
I heard you two went out.

01:16:51.507 --> 01:16:52.807
Oh...

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:54.542
Word travels fast.

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:57.778
Well, it was
a one-time thing.

01:16:57.814 --> 01:16:59.458
We both decided we would
be better as friends.

01:16:59.482 --> 01:17:01.449
Oh.

01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:07.521
You look beautiful.

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:12.059
Thank you.

01:17:12.095 --> 01:17:14.128
[microphone thumps and squeals]

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:15.730
Welcome, everyone.
Welcome! Welcome.

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:18.699
So nice to see you all
here tonight.

01:17:18.735 --> 01:17:20.215
I trust you're all
having a good time?

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:23.404
Yeah.
[applauding and cheering]

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:26.507
Folks, it has been
an absolutely wonderful year

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:27.341
for the agency,

01:17:27.377 --> 01:17:29.777
one full of
many, many successes,

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:33.247
and we owe all of that
to you good folks

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:34.548
and all your hard work,

01:17:34.584 --> 01:17:36.217
so thank you very much.

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:37.284
Thank you!

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.320
[all applauding]

01:17:40.123 --> 01:17:41.123
Before we go any further,

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:43.524
I have a little bit of business
to take care of.

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:45.926
As many of you already know,

01:17:45.962 --> 01:17:48.629
James Porter will be
retiring this year.

01:17:48.665 --> 01:17:50.531
Yes, I know...

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:53.300
and he leaves
some very large shoes to fill.

01:17:53.336 --> 01:17:56.037
But after
some careful deliberation,

01:17:56.072 --> 01:17:58.739
I feel that I have
found the perfect candidate

01:17:58.775 --> 01:17:59.874
to fill those large shoes.

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:01.587
Ladies and gentlemen, put your
hands together please.

01:18:01.611 --> 01:18:03.244
A round of applause

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:05.079
for Miss Melanie Welsh.

01:18:05.114 --> 01:18:07.048
[gasping and applauding]

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:11.953
Thanks, guys.

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:17.491
All right, now, DJ,
let's get this party started!

01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:19.460
[cheering]

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:27.968
Would you like
to dance?

01:18:28.004 --> 01:18:30.471
Oh. Yes. Yeah.

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:40.581
Congratulations.

01:18:40.616 --> 01:18:42.550
Thank you.

01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:47.555
I know you wanted
the job, too.

01:18:49.459 --> 01:18:51.492
I did.
But you deserved it.

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:53.494
I learned a lot
from you.

01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:56.630
Well, thank you.

01:18:58.468 --> 01:19:00.801
[♪♪♪]

01:19:02.805 --> 01:19:03.805
Oh, my goodness!

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.514
Okay, the next one is for...

01:19:13.549 --> 01:19:15.683
Jacqueline!

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:23.290
Look.

01:19:23.326 --> 01:19:24.792
[laughter]

01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:25.860
It's a little reindeer.

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:28.963
It's wonderful.
It really brings out your eyes.

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:30.698
[laughter]

01:19:30.733 --> 01:19:31.966
Who's
my Secret Santa?

01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:33.801
[woman]: It was me!

01:19:33.836 --> 01:19:35.369
Oh, Betty!
Thank you.

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:38.405
Okay. Next, we have...

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:39.974
Donovan!

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:43.677
[♪♪♪]

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:50.151
[sighs]

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:51.085
What is it?

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.687
A tie.

01:19:53.723 --> 01:19:55.656
What's underneath?

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:04.965
Basketball tickets.

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:09.370
Wow, what a thoughtful gift.

01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:12.106
Who does Donovan
have to thank?

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:15.643
[♪♪♪]

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:21.716
Thank you.

01:20:22.885 --> 01:20:24.685
You're welcome.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.521
Next one is for...

01:20:27.557 --> 01:20:29.123
- ...Alicia.
- Thank you!

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:31.692
[♪♪♪]

01:20:31.727 --> 01:20:34.295
He's leaving.
I blew it.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.896
Maybe he's just
getting some air.

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:39.033
No. No, I should've
told him sooner.

01:20:39.068 --> 01:20:40.901
Earrings!

01:20:40.937 --> 01:20:43.604
Oh, they're so cute!

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:45.039
Thank you, Secret Santa.

01:20:45.074 --> 01:20:46.874
Okay, everybody,
that's the last present.

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:48.442
Thank you very much, folks!

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:50.144
Wait! Melanie
didn't get a gift.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:51.378
You didn't?

01:20:51.414 --> 01:20:53.147
Oh! Uh, no. I didn't.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:55.449
But you know what,
it's okay, it's fine.

01:20:55.484 --> 01:20:57.251
That can't be right.

01:20:57.286 --> 01:20:58.897
- It's gotta be here somewhere.
- It's totally fine.

01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:00.754
I don't need a present.

01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:01.589
Hey, guys!

01:21:01.624 --> 01:21:02.990
You've got to come
check this out!

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:03.991
Everyone, let's go!

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.293
[♪♪♪]

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:10.030
Everyone, come on.

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:14.435
[astonished gasps and chuckles]

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:18.372
What is this?

01:21:20.509 --> 01:21:22.710
Melanie...
I'm your Secret Santa.

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:28.482
What a lovely gift.

01:21:29.552 --> 01:21:32.052
[♪♪♪]

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:36.757
- Are you in?
- Yeah.

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:37.992
Definitely over $50.

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:46.166
You get warm.

01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:50.037
Thank you
for the tickets.

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:51.038
Oh...

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.606
And the tie.

01:21:52.642 --> 01:21:54.008
That was
a really nice touch.

01:21:54.043 --> 01:21:55.309
Well, it was
what you wanted.

01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:56.710
That's true.

01:21:56.746 --> 01:21:59.246
[♪♪♪]

01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:04.218
You don't
seem surprised

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:06.053
that it was me.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:07.488
Yeah. I'm not.

01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:09.623
I figured it out.

01:22:09.659 --> 01:22:10.958
You did?

01:22:10.993 --> 01:22:13.027
Yeah, I'll admit,
it was hard at first,

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:15.329
and then I saw
the photograph

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:17.698
of your mother
on your desk,

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:19.211
and everything
kind of fell into place.

01:22:19.235 --> 01:22:20.235
Right.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:23.170
But what
I don't understand

01:22:23.205 --> 01:22:24.672
is why you never
told me,

01:22:24.707 --> 01:22:27.942
because you knew
that I wanted to meet.

01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:31.812
I guess I was...

01:22:31.847 --> 01:22:34.715
nervous about
your reaction.

01:22:35.685 --> 01:22:37.184
[laughs]

01:22:37.219 --> 01:22:38.819
Were you worried
I'd be upset?

01:22:38.854 --> 01:22:40.421
Well, we weren't
exactly

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:41.896
the best of friends
in the beginning,

01:22:43.526 --> 01:22:44.825
Melanie...

01:22:46.862 --> 01:22:49.396
I wanted it to be you.

01:22:49.432 --> 01:22:50.664
You did?

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:53.634
Yep.

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.805
Now that
you know how I feel,

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:58.840
the question is,
how do...

01:23:02.678 --> 01:23:04.211
Merry Christmas.

01:23:05.715 --> 01:23:07.381
What happened
to "Bah, humbug"?

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:08.983
Ah, what can I say?

01:23:09.018 --> 01:23:10.217
You won me over.

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:14.288
