WEBVTT

00:33.634 --> 00:35.103
Never met her.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.370
Your hard drive says
you're a liar, McCall.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.407
We've recovered e-mails,
chat room conversations--

00:39.440 --> 00:42.110
the whole sick courtship.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.478
You're a registered
sex offender

00:44.512 --> 00:46.614
with a appetite
for teenage girls.

00:46.647 --> 00:47.581
( scoffs )

00:47.615 --> 00:50.651
That's what all
the neighborhood flyers say.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.520
( over speaker ):
You're sick, Ryan.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.124
You need help.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.659
Step one is being honest...

00:58.692 --> 01:01.095
( David continues
indistinctly )

01:11.472 --> 01:13.174
...concrete answers.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.708
Charlie, the
clock's running, so...

01:18.879 --> 01:20.314
Hey, Megan.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.650
Hey.
How's it going?

01:22.683 --> 01:24.285
David's hit him from
pretty much every angle,

01:24.318 --> 01:26.387
but he's not having
any luck in there.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.489
And the victim's still
refusing to talk,

01:28.522 --> 01:30.758
and the files we found
on the computer

01:30.791 --> 01:32.693
aren't enough to hold him,
never mind convict.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.895
Physical evidence is
our only chance

01:34.928 --> 01:36.597
to put it together.

01:36.630 --> 01:41.869
Well, there's always Charlie's
Inequality Bounding... thing.

01:41.902 --> 01:45.639
There is always Charlie's
Inequality Bounding thing.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.480
To examine the defined
data points...

01:52.513 --> 01:53.581
Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie...

01:53.614 --> 01:55.183
All right,
all right.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.850
There's two dogs chained

01:56.884 --> 01:58.819
to different corners
of the backyard.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.788
-Right. -Now, the lengths
of their chains,

02:00.821 --> 02:01.855
as well as their
respective positions

02:01.889 --> 02:04.325
will limit the area that
they can come into contact.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.427
So, what, we do the same thing
with McCall and the victim?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.196
Starting with
the known locations,

02:08.229 --> 02:10.198
and employing the timeframes
of the attack.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.500
We can focus our
search efforts on a...

02:12.533 --> 02:15.169
( gunshots )

02:15.203 --> 02:16.670
( woman screams )

02:18.806 --> 02:20.374
Stay down!

02:27.281 --> 02:27.848
( single gunshot )

02:29.250 --> 02:30.384
( another single shot )

02:30.418 --> 02:31.352
MAN:
Down!

02:37.291 --> 02:39.293
MAN 2:
Help! Help!

02:39.327 --> 02:40.828
-Get down!
-( gunshot )

02:45.266 --> 02:46.234
( gunshot )

02:48.236 --> 02:49.169
( gunshot; glass shatters )

02:52.506 --> 02:53.841
( multiple gunshots )

02:53.874 --> 02:54.808
( man screams )

02:55.776 --> 02:56.477
( gunshot )

03:00.748 --> 03:01.915
-( woman shrieking )
-WOMAN: Stay down!

03:04.985 --> 03:10.791
( gunfire,
bullets ricocheting )

03:13.527 --> 03:14.595
( gunshot; glass shatters )

03:16.430 --> 03:17.365
( gunshot )

03:22.603 --> 03:24.872
( gunshots popping )

03:32.880 --> 03:34.482
All right,
paramedics.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.816
Who's hit?!
Who's down?!

03:35.849 --> 03:38.919
( sirens wailing in distance )

03:40.988 --> 03:41.989
He's still breathing.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.827
You all right?

03:46.860 --> 03:47.861
-Did you get hit?
-Huh?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.330
-Let me see.
-No. No, no!

03:49.363 --> 03:50.564
-You sure you're okay?
-I'm okay!

03:50.598 --> 03:51.565
MEGAN:
SWAT's mobilizing,

03:51.599 --> 03:53.267
the paramedics are on their way,

03:53.301 --> 03:55.803
I got two bullet wounds,
they're both minor,

03:55.836 --> 03:57.571
and some cuts
from the glass.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.939
-That's it?
-No.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.341
Whoever this guy is...

04:00.374 --> 04:02.443
I think he got who he came for.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.017
We all use math every day,

04:10.050 --> 04:12.620
to predict weather,

04:12.653 --> 04:15.489
to tell time,

04:15.523 --> 04:17.024
to handle money.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.995
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

04:22.029 --> 04:28.369
It's logic... rationality.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.338
It's using your mind

04:30.371 --> 04:32.540
to solve the biggest mysteries
that we know.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.015
The shooter's wallet says
his name is Alec Schane.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.017
He's a realtor
from Pasadena.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.653
He walked in the door
and told them

04:45.686 --> 04:48.021
he had information
about a museum robbery.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.624
Then he met agent Labella
at the elevators,

04:50.658 --> 04:52.526
disarmed him and put him
in a choke hold.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.429
How's he do that,
how does he disarm an agent?

04:55.463 --> 04:56.597
Well, all Labella
could say

04:56.630 --> 04:57.631
was that he was
really fast

04:57.665 --> 04:58.966
and really strong.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.668
And then Schane used him
as a human shield

05:00.701 --> 05:01.735
and he let off 15 rounds.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.571
And only one fatality?

05:03.604 --> 05:05.973
Yeah, Ryan McCall,
the predicate sex offender.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.575
DAVID:
SWAT team gave the all-clear

05:07.608 --> 05:09.577
to reenter the building,
but Evidence Response

05:09.610 --> 05:11.545
wants a few hours
to check out the bullpen.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.714
All right. Why don't you just
grab whatever space you can,

05:13.747 --> 05:14.815
start working on the connection

05:14.848 --> 05:16.850
between Schane and
the sex offender.

05:16.884 --> 05:17.818
-All right?
-Uh-huh.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.894
Hey, Charlie. Hey.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.095
How you doing?
You all right?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.799
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.100
How is everybody?

05:33.133 --> 05:35.569
Well, you know, I mean...

05:35.603 --> 05:38.005
Look, all things considered,
I'd say we got off lucky.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.773
Lucky.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.442
He nearly killed all of us--

05:41.475 --> 05:43.577
I don't see how you get up
and deal with this every day.

05:43.611 --> 05:44.578
Eh, you know.

05:44.612 --> 05:45.913
I don't get shot at every day.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.381
Come on, I'll get you
some coffee.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.583
No, I gotta go,
I should go back to school.

05:49.617 --> 05:50.784
I should get some work done.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.025
( machine beeps )

05:58.058 --> 06:00.494
Mr. Schane?

06:00.528 --> 06:01.795
Mr. Schane,
can you hear me?

06:03.864 --> 06:06.867
I'd like to know
why you shot Ryan McCall.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.645
Did he assault your daughter?

06:41.769 --> 06:43.871
DAVID:
Mrs. Schane?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.539
Have you ever seen
this man before?

06:49.543 --> 06:50.811
No, I've never seen him before.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.146
How about you,
Samantha?

06:54.114 --> 06:54.948
No?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.151
Do you have any idea why
your husband would do this?

06:58.185 --> 07:00.187
Well, I still don't
believe that he did.

07:01.722 --> 07:02.656
What did he say?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.559
He asked
for a lawyer.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.899
Then I shouldn't
talk to you either,

07:11.932 --> 07:12.800
should I.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.935
Mrs. Schane,
your husband killed a man

07:14.968 --> 07:16.804
inside of a
federal building.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.772
We're just trying
to understand why.

07:18.806 --> 07:22.109
Well, I can't help you
understand what I don't!

07:22.142 --> 07:26.079
And if he doesn't want
to cooperate with you...

07:26.113 --> 07:27.615
I trust him.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.823
And, so, Don and I
are simply talking...

07:35.856 --> 07:38.258
talking about
inequality bounding.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.260
And, uh...

07:40.293 --> 07:43.230
and then I heard
breaking glass...

07:43.263 --> 07:45.799
and a bullet goes
past my head.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.670
There's noise.

07:49.703 --> 07:50.871
There's blood.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.640
-Chaos.
-Chaos...

07:52.673 --> 07:56.143
"Chaos" presupposes an
observable or measurable system.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.011
A deterministic
equation

07:58.045 --> 07:59.513
with an outcome
sensitive

07:59.547 --> 08:00.781
to initial conditions.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.183
I was speaking
in the vernacular, Charles.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.317
And, yet, you know,

08:04.351 --> 08:07.054
we have stumbled into
a rather lofty discussion here.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.055
Because one could argue

08:08.088 --> 08:10.624
that violence
on the human scale

08:10.658 --> 08:12.626
is reflective of
a fundamental state,

08:12.660 --> 08:14.628
as evident
from the magnificent

08:14.662 --> 08:16.764
collisions of subatomic
particles,

08:16.797 --> 08:19.633
the operatic clashes
of galaxies.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.301
Is that supposed to be
reassuring, Larry?

08:21.334 --> 08:24.204
On the macro level,
yes, absolutely.

08:24.237 --> 08:27.541
Though microcosmically,
perhaps not so much.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.542
Don laughs
it off

08:28.576 --> 08:29.577
like it's some
funny thing

08:29.610 --> 08:30.544
that happened
at the office.

08:30.578 --> 08:31.912
AMITA:
It's a coping mechanism,

08:31.945 --> 08:32.913
Charlie.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.548
I mean, he sees
violence daily,

08:34.582 --> 08:36.650
so he processes it with humor.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.285
Speaking of which,
how are you coping?

08:38.318 --> 08:40.788
Why is...
Everyone's asking me that, why?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.322
Because a little bit of
post-traumatic stress

08:42.355 --> 08:43.591
is natural,

08:43.624 --> 08:45.593
if not inevitable.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.227
And for you to return
to work this early,

08:47.260 --> 08:48.796
-I think is...
-Ah, man!

08:48.829 --> 08:50.063
Look, guys, hey,

08:50.097 --> 08:53.100
uh, I need to concentrate
on this.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.167
So, can you guys, uh...

08:54.201 --> 08:56.604
Yeah. Okay.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.971
Of course.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.940
Okay. Thank you.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.008
Thank you.

09:02.810 --> 09:03.977
Listen, Charlie,

09:04.011 --> 09:05.813
-Yes, your concern
-if you want to talk...

09:05.846 --> 09:07.748
is appreciated;
it really is.

09:07.781 --> 09:08.916
I just...
allow me to work.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.150
Please.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.689
( sighs )

09:15.723 --> 09:16.724
No.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.599
If Schane knew McCall,
there's no public record of it.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.600
What about the daughter?

09:26.634 --> 09:27.668
She didn't react
to his picture.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.737
And there's no Internet
contact--

09:29.770 --> 09:31.705
-McCall's usual M.O.
-COLBY: I'm starting to think

09:31.739 --> 09:32.706
it might be something
entirely different.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.241
Just an attack against the FBI.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.109
DAVID:
He's chairman of his PTA.

09:36.143 --> 09:40.013
You couldn't find a more typical
suburban dad than Alec Schane.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.782
Yeah, but there's
no record of depression,

09:41.815 --> 09:43.784
and there's no sudden
changes of behavior at work.

09:43.817 --> 09:44.618
All right,
that's what

09:44.652 --> 09:45.753
he doesn't have, so...

09:45.786 --> 09:47.187
Well, I can tell you

09:47.220 --> 09:50.323
what he does have
is some serious technique.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.494
DAVID:
Yeah, he's fast.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.697
I pulled that move straight
from the Quantico playbook.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.799
Yeah, and he countered with

09:58.832 --> 09:59.733
a flawlessly
executed leg shoot.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.269
I mean, that's a classic
self-defense move.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.971
Yeah, he's obviously got
some martial-arts training.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.372
DON: Well, that's some
serious training.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.908
Come in here with the confidence
to disarm an agent?

10:09.677 --> 10:12.045
( fighters giving
martial-arts yells )

10:16.249 --> 10:18.652
Well, Alec Schane was
a student here.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.120
What is this about?

10:20.153 --> 10:21.388
It's about
a savate kick.

10:24.825 --> 10:28.095
A savate kick followed by
a Hadaka-jime combination.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.098
Koketsu is
the only discipline

10:31.131 --> 10:32.933
that teaches
this combination,

10:32.966 --> 10:35.669
and yours is the only
Koketsu dojo in the county.

10:35.703 --> 10:36.670
Sensei.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.672
Where'd you study?

10:38.706 --> 10:39.940
I teach Krav Maga at the Y.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.777
And I've seen your
exhibitions on self-defense.

10:46.814 --> 10:47.647
Alec Schane.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.150
Brown belt in less
than three years.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.084
What happened?

10:51.118 --> 10:52.953
He disarmed a federal agent

10:52.986 --> 10:53.954
and shot three people,

10:53.987 --> 10:55.288
one fatally.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.859
Apparently, using techniques
that he learned here.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.994
Alec isn't just
a good fighter,

11:01.028 --> 11:02.763
he's a dedicated member
of the dojo.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.932
He brings a positive attitude
to every class.

11:04.965 --> 11:08.368
And have you seen any change
in that attitude of late?

11:08.401 --> 11:10.704
There was a problem with Kurt.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.205
Who's Kurt?

11:12.239 --> 11:15.375
Older guy, came in

11:15.408 --> 11:17.077
for a few classes,
then dropped out.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.746
The two of them seemed
friendly at first,

11:18.779 --> 11:19.780
but after a week,

11:19.813 --> 11:23.050
Alec went cold, hostile even.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.885
I suspect that that's why
Kurt stopped showing up.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.887
Do you happen
to remember

11:26.920 --> 11:28.756
if they'd done any work
on this combination?

11:28.789 --> 11:29.622
A lot.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.893
Kurt signed up
specifically to learn

11:32.926 --> 11:33.727
disarming techniques.

11:33.761 --> 11:34.995
Do you have an address
on this guy,

11:35.028 --> 11:36.363
from a credit card
receipt maybe?

11:36.396 --> 11:38.465
Let me check my files.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.733
Excuse me.

11:42.836 --> 11:43.737
Krav Maga at the Y?

11:43.771 --> 11:46.306
Okay, you know, you're
going to arrest people

11:46.339 --> 11:48.508
that are a hundred pounds
heavier than you,

11:48.541 --> 11:50.243
you're going to need
to learn some hobbies.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.747
You know,
if he's been rehearsing

11:53.781 --> 11:55.783
this combination
with this Kurt guy...

11:55.816 --> 11:57.517
That means there's another
person out there

11:57.550 --> 11:59.719
who's capable of launching
a second attack.

12:00.854 --> 12:01.755
Maybe a bigger attack.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.965
COLBY: This sketch is based on
the jujitsu instructor's

12:11.999 --> 12:13.166
best description of Kurt.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.104
About 180 pounds, slight accent,
maybe German, maybe Dutch.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.839
He didn't seem to know.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.507
Because of the possibility
that he might be planning

12:20.540 --> 12:22.509
a similar attack, we have
every law enforcement agency

12:22.542 --> 12:24.978
in Southern California
on high alert.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.179
I see in
your notes

12:26.213 --> 12:27.347
Kurt Weiland was a bogus name

12:27.380 --> 12:28.982
and the address
he gave the dojo.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.250
DAVID: Schane's out of
critical condition,

12:30.283 --> 12:33.320
but he's still
refusing to talk.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.289
You know, if McCall had sexually
abused someone close to Schane,

12:36.323 --> 12:37.791
I think he'd be talking to us

12:37.825 --> 12:39.292
or talking to the
press, you know?

12:39.326 --> 12:42.395
He'd be throwing out
a justification for his actions.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.463
You know, he spent two weeks

12:43.496 --> 12:45.265
teaching these same techniques
to somebody else.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.134
I don't think McCall
was the target.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.168
All right, guys, look.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.202
Ballistics just matched
the bullet

12:49.236 --> 12:50.337
that killed McCall...

12:51.538 --> 12:53.440
...to your gun.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.010
Yeah, exactly.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.279
So ASC wants you
on restricted duty

12:59.312 --> 13:00.113
until they can get
the shooting team

13:00.147 --> 13:01.849
to take a look at this.
I'm sorry...

13:01.882 --> 13:03.316
DAVID: Don, it's obviously
an accident--

13:03.350 --> 13:04.251
a ricochet or something.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.986
Bullets were flying
all over the place.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.287
It's all right, it's all right.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.089
Restricted duty.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.158
Just means no field duty
until they can clear you--

13:11.191 --> 13:13.160
do a psychiatric review,
that sort of thing.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.227
And you know,
a psychiatric review

13:14.261 --> 13:15.328
is totally standard procedure.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.998
You do this long enough,
we've all been through one.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.332
DON: Exactly. You should
take advantage.

13:19.366 --> 13:22.369
Take a few days off,
go surfing, whatever.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.071
All right, look, guys,

13:24.104 --> 13:25.105
I appreciate it;
thank you.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.439
But if this guy's
still out here,

13:26.473 --> 13:27.374
he may be planning
another attack--

13:27.407 --> 13:28.909
I'm going to be here.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.177
You need everybody on this case.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.179
I'll be on my desk.
I'm not going anywhere.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.417
DON:
We're going with the assumption

13:37.450 --> 13:38.886
that this Kurt
is planning another attack.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.620
I know, but, look,

13:40.653 --> 13:44.591
this one, I just don't see
how my math can help you.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.027
That's the thing: we gotta
make sense of the first one.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.328
We get Schane's motive,
maybe that'll tell us

13:48.361 --> 13:50.397
something about Kurt, right?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.866
You remember that work
you did with paths?

13:52.900 --> 13:54.501
What, combinatorial
optimization?

13:54.534 --> 13:55.969
LARRY: Sure, there's minimum
spanning tree,

13:56.003 --> 13:58.505
the traveling salesman problem.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.974
Neither of which
are applicable to this analysis.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.476
Well, how about applying weights
to the potential victims?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.577
Right, like what you did

14:04.611 --> 14:06.213
with the threat analysis
but in reverse.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.581
See if we can figure out
who the intended target was.

14:10.918 --> 14:14.121
If there was a target at all.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.157
Larry, come over here.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.192
Tell me,
does the shooter's path

14:19.226 --> 14:21.094
look Brownian to you?

14:21.128 --> 14:22.395
Well, Stochastic, sure,

14:22.429 --> 14:24.031
Markovian, maybe,

14:24.064 --> 14:25.632
but Brownian?
Let me see.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.436
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
I do see this.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.904
See what? What?

14:30.938 --> 14:33.073
Picture a pool table...

14:33.106 --> 14:37.377
with a cueball
in constant motion.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.347
The cueball-- our shooter--
is following a straight path

14:40.380 --> 14:42.082
until it hits an obstacle--

14:42.115 --> 14:44.617
another ball
or a boundary, the rail.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.420
And then it sets off
in a new straight path,

14:47.454 --> 14:49.456
until it hits another obstacle.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.457
The table is
the office,

14:50.490 --> 14:51.992
the ball is the people in it?

14:52.025 --> 14:54.427
Yeah, a Brownian path
would indicate an initially

14:54.461 --> 14:57.297
random direction followed by
random direction change,

14:57.330 --> 15:01.301
which means he wasn't moving
toward any particular point.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.369
CHARLIE:
Or shooting at

15:02.402 --> 15:04.537
any particular person.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.405
In fact,
inflicting injury

15:05.438 --> 15:07.007
might not have even
been his intention.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.341
If I can examine
the diffusion,

15:08.375 --> 15:11.378
I may be able to shed
light on his motive.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.546
We got the war room
up and running again.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.215
You can look at
the security footage.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.383
-How's that?
-I can't go downtown.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.051
Not now.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.553
I... I'm in between classes
and my cognitive emergence work.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.222
Charlie, we're talking
about another attack.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.457
Don, you're not listening.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.559
I'm saying I can
work on your case, okay?

15:26.593 --> 15:29.062
I can work here, and
I can work at home.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.364
And... anything you have,
send it to me.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.568
He doesn't seem
good, huh?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.570
Well, protests
to the contrary,

15:37.604 --> 15:39.506
yesterday's events seem to have
affected his demeanor.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.474
Yeah, well, a bullet misses you
by that little,

15:41.508 --> 15:43.210
you get a new look
inside your own head.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.311
Look, I understand.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.678
I just think
you need to acknowledge

15:45.712 --> 15:47.114
the emotional impact of that.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.116
Yeah.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.384
He'll be all right.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.385
Right?

16:08.468 --> 16:11.271
* Eyes open wide

16:11.304 --> 16:13.740
* Body and soul

16:13.773 --> 16:15.475
* Makes me alive

16:15.508 --> 16:19.546
* You need to live

16:19.579 --> 16:21.681
* But your kisses

16:23.750 --> 16:25.118
* But your kisses...

16:37.664 --> 16:40.533
COLBY: I had this screen-capture
enhanced.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.701
Schane may not have liked Kurt,

16:41.734 --> 16:44.737
but that's exactly who drove him
the morning of the attack.

16:44.771 --> 16:45.738
Had his I.D. confirmed

16:45.772 --> 16:47.574
by the jujitsu
instructor.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.509
And the plates
on the car came back

16:49.542 --> 16:52.345
to a Motorco rental car company,
stolen off the lot

16:52.379 --> 16:53.146
two hours before.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.214
He didn't even
change the plates?

16:54.247 --> 16:57.184
Knew it wouldn't show up
on the hot sheets in time?

16:57.217 --> 17:00.287
Put out an APB,
hope we'll get lucky.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.189
Gets more done at his desk
than the entire FBI.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.190
( chuckles )

17:05.292 --> 17:08.328
Anyway, that facial recognition
software came up with nothing,

17:08.361 --> 17:11.331
so I'm going to go out wide
to local law enforcement,

17:11.364 --> 17:14.201
see if we can't get
an I.D. on this guy.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.471
He's taking it pretty hard.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.373
We all know
he's going to get cleared.

17:20.407 --> 17:23.210
He has had a pretty bad day.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.113
And I think, all in all,
he's hanging pretty tough.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.391
I remember buying those.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.493
Little did I suspect

17:40.527 --> 17:42.862
that it would take you
20 years to play with them.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.632
I can't make sense of this path,
so I figured

17:45.665 --> 17:47.400
reconstructing the office
with a three-dimensional model

17:47.434 --> 17:50.137
might jog
some thoughts.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.904
Well, why don't you
just go down there?

17:55.775 --> 17:57.344
You haven't said much
about what happened.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.146
Well...

17:59.179 --> 18:01.214
Well, you didn't seem
to want to talk about it.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.382
I don't.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.286
Figured that you might want to.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.487
Figured that you'd be...

18:07.520 --> 18:09.189
What? Upset? Angry?

18:09.222 --> 18:11.324
Freaked out.

18:11.358 --> 18:14.161
Well, no, I was,
um, um, uh, relieved.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.728
Yeah, yeah, I was freaked out.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.831
I was looking right at him.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.902
I gotta tell you,

18:22.935 --> 18:27.407
I don't think I knew what
being scared was before that.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.344
You know, fear is a very
practical feeling, Charlie.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.346
It's, um...

18:33.380 --> 18:34.481
well, it's mostly
common sense,

18:34.514 --> 18:37.650
telling you not to poke
the alligator with the stick.

18:37.684 --> 18:41.321
I know this kind of thing
happening again is improbable,

18:41.354 --> 18:43.823
but just the thought
of going back to Don's office

18:43.856 --> 18:46.326
just puts knots in my stomach.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.828
And I realize

18:48.861 --> 18:51.764
the only thing
I'm really afraid of

18:51.798 --> 18:53.533
is being afraid again.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.607
Hey, Charlie.

19:02.809 --> 19:03.910
Do you remember Sam Tichell?

19:03.943 --> 19:04.911
How could I
forget him?

19:04.944 --> 19:08.215
He terrorized me through
the whole third grade,

19:08.248 --> 19:09.882
and I had to wait
for Don every day,

19:09.916 --> 19:11.184
to walk home from school.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.151
Yeah.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.221
And the one time
Don didn't walk you home...

19:14.254 --> 19:17.190
I got into a fight
with Sam Tichell...

19:17.224 --> 19:19.859
right in the Meyers' front yard.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.962
I know; I was standing
at the window watching.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.598
I saw him knock you down
from behind.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.267
I didn't come outside
to help you.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.501
Yeah, you did.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.237
You broke us up.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.771
Eventually, but not right away.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.240
See, Charlie,
you were always so loved,

19:33.273 --> 19:34.341
you were always so protected.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.743
It was at that moment
that I wanted you to understand

19:36.776 --> 19:38.978
that the world was not always
going to be a safe place.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.982
I came outside to help you only
when you started to fight back.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.885
Because that's when I knew
that you had enough heart

19:45.918 --> 19:48.187
to take whatever
life was going to throw at you.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.595
DAVID:
What's the first thing

19:55.628 --> 19:57.997
a New Yorker notices
about L.A.?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.332
MEGAN:
No good pizza.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.968
Okay, the second thing.

20:02.001 --> 20:05.238
Everyone drives
everywhere.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.906
You're gonna
steal a car

20:06.939 --> 20:09.008
out of a rental lot,
how you gonna get there?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.978
Drive your own car,
park it somewhere nearby?

20:12.011 --> 20:14.247
You can't take the bus or a cab,

20:14.281 --> 20:16.249
'cause somebody
might remember you.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.284
When you're done with that car,

20:17.317 --> 20:20.253
where you
gonna dump it?

20:20.287 --> 20:21.821
Somewhere close
to where you parked.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.805
MEGAN:
Wait a minute.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.473
Do you see
something up there?

20:40.507 --> 20:42.041
Yes, I do.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.278
We won't find Kurt's
prints on that car.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.480
You know, I'm getting
the feeling that this guy

20:47.514 --> 20:49.449
isn't just following
some soccer dad's lead.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.017
More like the mastermind
behind the scene,

20:51.050 --> 20:52.652
two steps
ahead of us.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.322
Yeah, only he knows where
this is going and we don't.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.997
COLBY: Just got the crime scene
reports back

21:05.031 --> 21:06.566
on the torched car.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.067
-Yeah? Anything?
-No, nothing.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.002
We don't catch a break
soon, the next time

21:10.036 --> 21:12.805
we see Kurt is gonna be the next
time he decides to attack.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.073
This is forensics on McCall.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.776
The bullet that killed him had
Schane's blood and tissue on it.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.411
It went through his shoulder,
the window,

21:18.445 --> 21:19.912
and landed
in McCall's skull,

21:19.946 --> 21:21.614
so you got nothing to worry
about with the shooting team.

21:21.648 --> 21:22.649
It's gonna be a walk.

21:22.682 --> 21:23.750
All right.
Well, how long

21:23.783 --> 21:25.585
till I'm back in the
field, do you think?

21:25.618 --> 21:26.953
Like a week, maybe two.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.490
Yeah. I don't know why

21:30.523 --> 21:32.492
it sounded better
when I heard it, but...

21:33.593 --> 21:35.462
A man's dead, Don.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.996
Colby, you cleared
your line of fire.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.332
You took a good shot--
the bullet took a bad bounce.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.734
Now, come on, there's nothing
you can do about that.

21:41.768 --> 21:42.735
It's not your fault.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.804
Yeah, I know, it might
not be my fault, Don,

21:44.837 --> 21:47.006
but it's still my bullet.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.682
Your dad says

21:55.715 --> 21:57.984
you've been in here
all night.

21:58.017 --> 22:01.688
I was sure that the shooter's
path was... was Brownian...

22:03.089 --> 22:03.990
...that the pure randomness

22:04.023 --> 22:06.593
would... would somehow
tell me something

22:06.626 --> 22:09.829
about Schane's actions.

22:09.862 --> 22:10.830
Something isn't right.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.699
I tried using

22:12.732 --> 22:14.033
a loop-erased random walk,

22:14.066 --> 22:16.669
tinkered with
a Langevin Equation,

22:16.703 --> 22:19.005
and still,
there's a disparity there,

22:19.038 --> 22:22.609
telling me something that maybe
this isn't Brownian motion,

22:22.642 --> 22:26.078
that maybe there's a corruption
in the data; I don't know.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.147
At the Jaipur
Observatory,

22:28.180 --> 22:30.683
they have these huge,
magnificent sundials,

22:30.717 --> 22:33.085
and they're so accurate,
they were used

22:33.119 --> 22:35.855
to set standard time
until the 1940s.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.491
Now India's standard time is set
by the Allahabad Observatory.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.926
Do you know why?

22:39.959 --> 22:42.962
I'm assuming because Allahabad
is more accurate.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.697
No.

22:44.731 --> 22:48.034
In order to keep all of India
in the same time zone,

22:48.067 --> 22:50.036
they have to split
the difference between the east

22:50.069 --> 22:51.638
and west halves of the country.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.173
And Allahabad is exactly
five and a half hours

22:54.206 --> 22:55.642
off of Greenwich
Mean Time.

22:57.109 --> 23:00.046
I see that your metaphors
are starting to sound

23:00.079 --> 23:02.949
a lot like
Larry's metaphors.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.418
The Jaipur sundials
aren't wrong, Charlie.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.420
The sun and the
moon still move

23:07.454 --> 23:09.055
through the sky
the same way.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.890
You see, people have
changed their perspectives

23:10.923 --> 23:12.492
on time, Charlie.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.793
I think what
Amita's telling you

23:13.826 --> 23:15.728
is to take a step
back from your problem,

23:15.762 --> 23:17.063
try a new perspective.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.432
Or a new dimension.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.840
ALAN: Oh, now, there's
a toy I remember.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.041
-Tessa...
-It's a tesseract.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.677
A four-dimensional hypercube.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.211
Could be why I bought
those soldiers.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.646
Those I can understand.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.516
A square on a chalkboard

23:36.549 --> 23:38.918
represents
two dimensions:

23:38.951 --> 23:40.987
an x and y axis.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.188
You add a
third dimension,

23:42.221 --> 23:43.990
a z-axis...

23:44.023 --> 23:45.057
You get a cube.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.727
See, I do have a passing
familiarity with geometry.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.029
Right, but
three-dimensional objects exist

23:50.062 --> 23:52.865
in a fourth dimension:
in time,

23:52.899 --> 23:56.503
so if we add a fourth
dimension to the cube,

23:56.536 --> 23:58.905
just like we added a third
dimension to the square,

23:58.938 --> 24:02.542
we get a tesseract, but this
isn't really a tesseract,

24:02.575 --> 24:05.077
just like that
isn't really a cube.

24:05.111 --> 24:05.945
See, my mistake
was that

24:05.978 --> 24:08.548
I took a two-dimensional
mapping data,

24:08.581 --> 24:10.750
and brought it
into the third dimension.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.785
I'm... I'm still short
one dimension.

24:12.819 --> 24:13.853
You mean time?

24:13.886 --> 24:16.188
I need to see a picture

24:16.222 --> 24:20.259
of a man's movements
through real time.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.496
I'll have to go back to the FBI.

24:23.530 --> 24:26.065
( elevator bell dings )

24:53.192 --> 24:54.794
-( woman screams )
-( gunshot echoes )

24:56.195 --> 24:57.864
Hey, guys.

24:57.897 --> 24:58.931
How we doing?

24:58.965 --> 25:01.701
Hey.

25:01.734 --> 25:02.835
Charlie?

25:06.973 --> 25:09.008
Oh, yeah, they must have
brought those out here.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.209
We'll get you
another one, all right?

25:15.680 --> 25:16.960
Everything all right?

25:26.993 --> 25:29.195
We're going to need
the surveillance footage,

25:29.228 --> 25:31.097
some tripods,

25:31.130 --> 25:36.769
a laser pointer,
and we're gonna need string.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.137
String?

25:38.170 --> 25:40.072
Lots of string.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.250
*

26:05.060 --> 26:06.030
AMITA: This is a
four-dimensional

26:06.060 --> 26:07.630
modeling program.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.460
It's used to analyze
weather patterns,

26:09.500 --> 26:12.670
geographical surveys,
even factory efficiency.

26:12.700 --> 26:15.940
And this is Schane's journey
through the office.

26:15.970 --> 26:19.710
And when we render it over time,
the flaw becomes apparent.

26:19.740 --> 26:20.770
What do you mean, "flaw"?

26:20.810 --> 26:22.910
Well, up until this point...

26:22.940 --> 26:24.780
And after this point...

26:24.810 --> 26:27.910
His movements are reactive,
but here-- here-- they aren't.

26:27.950 --> 26:30.020
So, what, you saying
he found a target?

26:30.050 --> 26:31.790
The opposite.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.020
Don, remember when I compared

26:34.050 --> 26:35.760
Brownian motion
to a cue ball

26:35.790 --> 26:37.590
ricocheting across a pool table?

26:37.620 --> 26:40.130
It's as if the cue ball saw
that it was about to hit

26:40.160 --> 26:42.430
the eight ball and stopped dead
in its tracks

26:42.460 --> 26:43.960
and turned around.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.030
Schane pulled a 180.

26:46.070 --> 26:48.740
The only time he retraced

26:48.770 --> 26:49.670
his steps.

26:49.700 --> 26:50.740
So what backed him off?

26:50.770 --> 26:53.640
Roughly? This workspace.

26:53.670 --> 26:55.480
More specifically,

26:55.510 --> 26:57.610
I believe he
was avoiding

26:57.640 --> 26:59.910
one or both of these people,

26:59.950 --> 27:01.110
making a very
specific effort

27:01.150 --> 27:03.650
not to shoot at them.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.120
COLBY:
John DeVries and Dave Taggart.

27:05.150 --> 27:07.720
They're both GS-7
intelligence assistants.

27:07.750 --> 27:08.760
Criminal data entry

27:08.790 --> 27:11.590
and analysis, both with
top-secret clearance.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.960
There's no connections
to Schane yet,

27:12.990 --> 27:14.230
but I'm still digging.

27:14.260 --> 27:15.760
All right, well,
get their computers stripped,

27:15.800 --> 27:17.000
put them in the rooms,
all right?

27:17.030 --> 27:17.930
Yeah, I got
DeVries in One.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.530
Taggart called in sick
after the shooting.

27:19.570 --> 27:20.700
What do you mean,
"called in sick"?

27:20.730 --> 27:21.970
Get him in here--
I don't care.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.740
I got Megan and Dave on their
way to pick him up right now.

27:24.770 --> 27:27.010
Heard the Agent
Shooting Team

27:27.040 --> 27:28.070
is going to clear Colby.

27:28.110 --> 27:29.580
I heard the same.

27:29.610 --> 27:31.980
How come everyone seems happy
about it but him?

27:32.010 --> 27:34.210
I've never seen him
shut down like that before.

27:34.250 --> 27:36.620
You know, it may not
be about this shooting.

27:36.650 --> 27:38.750
Sometimes, intense
events can open up

27:38.790 --> 27:41.050
all kinds of
other doors.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.130
Looks like somebody got up early
and packed for a trip.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.860
Looks like someone
saw us coming, too.

27:55.600 --> 27:56.940
It's still warm.

28:00.870 --> 28:02.880
MEGAN:
When you were a kid,

28:02.910 --> 28:04.710
were you the worst at
hide-and-go-seek ever?

28:10.750 --> 28:13.090
COLBY: DeVries is checking out
clean, but Taggart,

28:13.120 --> 28:15.860
on the other hand, seems
to have had a reason to run.

28:15.890 --> 28:18.160
He's got a second bank
account in Wichita Falls.

28:18.190 --> 28:20.990
He's had deposits of
$10, $20 and $50,000

28:21.030 --> 28:22.000
over the last four months.

28:22.030 --> 28:23.730
So what, he's
being paid off?

28:23.760 --> 28:25.200
What does
80 grand get him?

28:25.230 --> 28:27.830
Well, check this out-- Taggart's
been using our databases

28:27.870 --> 28:29.740
to access personal information
about Schane's family.

28:29.770 --> 28:31.000
He gets the wife's
DMV file,

28:31.040 --> 28:33.110
his daughter's
school schedule

28:33.140 --> 28:34.010
he's even been pulling photos

28:34.040 --> 28:37.040
off the LAPD public
surveillance cams.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.040
This must be
why a real estate agent

28:38.080 --> 28:40.110
from Pasadena ends up attacking
an FBI office.

28:40.150 --> 28:41.750
Yeah, also backs up

28:41.780 --> 28:43.850
Charlie's thing about him
changing direction, right?

28:43.880 --> 28:45.890
He shoots Taggart,
Kurt kills his family.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.190
Why make him attack us
to begin with?

28:47.220 --> 28:49.020
Victor Meuller.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.120
He's an arms dealer,

28:50.160 --> 28:51.960
on trial for selling
decommissioned

28:51.990 --> 28:54.660
Soviet tanks and fighter jets
to the wrong countries.

28:54.700 --> 28:57.060
"On trial," as in
it already started?

28:57.100 --> 28:59.230
Two weeks ago, and it's expected
to go least three months.

28:59.270 --> 29:01.070
Taggart's computer logs
show him fishing

29:01.100 --> 29:03.340
through Meuller's case files
on three separate occasions,

29:03.370 --> 29:04.370
then downloading what he found

29:04.400 --> 29:06.340
to a flash drive on the
morning of the shooting.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.010
The techs say the data theft
wouldn't have even showed up

29:09.040 --> 29:14.050
for weeks or months, if they
hadn't been looking for it.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.850
Victor Meuller--
he's on trial,

29:16.880 --> 29:19.850
knows he's going to jail,

29:19.890 --> 29:21.290
so he needs the names
and addresses

29:21.320 --> 29:22.320
of the witnesses against him.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.060
And you were willing
to sell a hit list for money.

29:25.090 --> 29:26.230
COLBY:
I don't know what rock

29:26.260 --> 29:27.930
he turned over,
but he found you.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.060
Now, the problem is, you got
no way to get the case file out.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.000
No way past
the screeners.

29:33.030 --> 29:35.870
Unless there's an emergency
evacuation of this building,

29:35.900 --> 29:37.600
like if some crazy
son of a bitch

29:37.640 --> 29:38.870
goes on a shooting rampage.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.840
I don't have to answer
any of your questions.

29:40.870 --> 29:43.880
Then don't, because the computer
trail is more than enough

29:43.910 --> 29:45.050
to convict you as is.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.310
The real question is,

29:46.350 --> 29:48.880
how much of forever
you want to spend in jail.

29:49.980 --> 29:51.950
Tell us about Kurt.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.690
He's a freelance hitter Meuller
brought over from Europe.

30:00.790 --> 30:02.660
So how did the two of you
find Schane?

30:02.700 --> 30:04.160
Kurt cruised
the self-defense schools,

30:04.200 --> 30:06.370
looking for
someone random,

30:06.400 --> 30:07.700
untraceable.

30:07.730 --> 30:10.740
Schane stood out: big, fast.

30:10.770 --> 30:12.740
Good enough to disarm
an FBI agent.

30:12.770 --> 30:15.840
Dave, you threatened
to murder his family.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.850
That was Kurt-- the things he
said he'd do to Schane's family,

30:18.880 --> 30:19.910
made me sick.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.850
I want you to tell us what
witness he's after next.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.920
And where do we find him?

30:27.950 --> 30:30.820
Even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

30:33.060 --> 30:35.400
I have family, too.

30:39.930 --> 30:40.870
Interpol just I.D.'d
the picture.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.870
His real name--
believe it or not-- is Kurt.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.070
Kurt De Lock.

30:44.100 --> 30:48.740
South African Special Forces,
451st Parachute Batallion.

30:48.780 --> 30:49.940
Yeah, he's suspected
of doing wet work

30:49.980 --> 30:51.910
for the secret police
during apartheid.

30:51.950 --> 30:53.950
-He's wanted in five countries.
-Six.

30:53.980 --> 30:55.980
We have extra
security

30:56.020 --> 30:57.220
on the courthouse

30:57.250 --> 30:58.920
and on everyone connected
to the Meuller trial.

30:58.950 --> 31:01.390
and two witnesses have
been moved to new safe houses.

31:01.420 --> 31:03.160
Eh, it's too defensive, no--
I mean, this guy's too good.

31:03.190 --> 31:04.960
We got to take the game to him,
I think.

31:04.990 --> 31:06.290
I mean, we'd better be

31:06.330 --> 31:08.030
anticipating
what he's going to do next.

31:08.060 --> 31:09.260
CHARLIE:
You guys ever notice

31:09.300 --> 31:12.430
how a criminal trial exhibits
self-organized criticality?

31:13.900 --> 31:14.870
Self-organized
criticality

31:14.900 --> 31:18.770
describes the ability
of multi-body systems

31:18.810 --> 31:20.470
to manifest
complex behavior--

31:20.510 --> 31:21.910
so forest fires,
earthquakes,

31:21.940 --> 31:22.680
financial markets.

31:24.810 --> 31:27.450
All right, picture
a pile of sand.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.150
As more sand falls
onto the pile,

31:30.180 --> 31:32.090
let's say a grain at a time,

31:32.120 --> 31:35.020
the grains come to rest
at a landing position.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.360
As the slope
of the pile steepens,

31:37.390 --> 31:40.430
the pile reaches
what we call a critical state,

31:40.460 --> 31:43.130
a state in which,
if a single grain of sand

31:43.160 --> 31:44.870
falls onto the pile
in the right position,

31:44.900 --> 31:46.970
you can create an avalanche.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.770
It's actually got a name.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.200
It's called the
Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld Sandpile.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.270
Kurt doesn't need to kill

31:52.310 --> 31:53.470
every witness
to collapse this case,

31:53.510 --> 31:56.110
just the key one or two.

31:56.140 --> 31:57.140
-You have that Meuller file?
-Mm-hmm.

31:57.180 --> 31:58.340
Okay, how do we find

31:58.380 --> 31:59.280
this grain of sand
you're talking about?

31:59.310 --> 32:01.480
We apply values to
components of the case--

32:01.510 --> 32:02.920
significance
of the witness

32:02.950 --> 32:04.250
or vulnerability.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.450
Hang on a second--
Agent Matt Pribitech, all right?

32:06.490 --> 32:09.020
This case against Meuller
started with a sting

32:09.060 --> 32:10.420
in Belgrave--
a phony missile buy.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.060
Pribitech was
the undercover.

32:12.090 --> 32:14.290
He was the key to this case--
he's in so deep,

32:14.330 --> 32:15.530
he's testifying in closed court.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.460
Which would explain why Kurt
needed the file-- to I.D. him.

32:18.500 --> 32:22.840
Without performing an initial
analysis, Pribitech...?

32:22.870 --> 32:24.270
...sounds like
a likely candidate to me.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.470
Pribitech's in the air right
now, on his way from Prague.

32:26.510 --> 32:27.970
He's scheduled to testify
at the end of the week.

32:28.010 --> 32:29.240
All right, I'm gonna call
the airport.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.480
Why don't you and David
meet him

32:30.510 --> 32:31.850
-at the gate?
-Yeah.

32:34.950 --> 32:36.780
That's him.

32:39.820 --> 32:41.190
What's he doing?

32:41.220 --> 32:42.860
He doesn't know he's been
compromised.

32:42.890 --> 32:44.490
Maybe he's just
being careful.

32:44.520 --> 32:47.290
I think that's
your department.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.400
Yeah.

32:57.170 --> 32:59.010
Why don't you guys
wear billboards?

32:59.040 --> 33:01.470
Your cover's
been blown, Matt.

33:01.510 --> 33:03.010
You think I don't know that?

33:05.450 --> 33:08.350
Kurt's got my family.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.720
Dave Taggart is under arrest.

33:28.760 --> 33:31.560
Every cop in the county has
Kurt De Lock's photograph.

33:31.590 --> 33:33.430
I know they threatened
your family.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.430
You have a duress defense
for the attack, but it's not

33:35.470 --> 33:38.030
going to get you very far
if you don't help us out.

33:38.070 --> 33:39.540
We can put your family
in protective custody,

33:39.570 --> 33:41.270
but we're not going
to lie to you, Alec:

33:41.300 --> 33:44.110
the only way they're truly safe
is if we find Kurt.

33:46.210 --> 33:48.480
He showed me pictures
of Trish and Sam,

33:48.510 --> 33:52.820
told me what he'll do to them
if I didn't...

33:52.850 --> 33:56.590
De Lock is threatening
another man's family now--

33:56.620 --> 33:57.820
another wife,

33:57.850 --> 33:59.360
and two kids,

33:59.390 --> 34:01.520
only this time, he went
and kidnapped them.

34:01.560 --> 34:02.760
He's going to do to that family

34:02.790 --> 34:06.060
what he threatened to do to
yours if you don't help me out.

34:09.370 --> 34:11.500
There's a trailer.

34:11.530 --> 34:14.370
Out in Needles.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.440
He made me go out there
to meet him a few times.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.780
( phone rings )

34:27.180 --> 34:29.350
Pribitech.

34:29.390 --> 34:31.290
KURT: You are going to change
your testimony,

34:31.320 --> 34:32.790
do you understand?

34:32.820 --> 34:33.790
When Victor Meuller
is acquitted,

34:33.820 --> 34:35.390
your family goes home.

34:35.430 --> 34:37.430
-If not...
-I need to talk to them first.

34:37.460 --> 34:38.560
Soon enough.

34:38.590 --> 34:40.300
Now, take down
these directions, Agent.

34:45.740 --> 34:49.340
DAVID: Yep, there's the trailer,
right where he said it would be.

34:49.370 --> 34:50.410
Three heat signatures,

34:50.440 --> 34:52.180
all stationary.

34:52.210 --> 34:53.580
All right, so mother,
daughter, son, right?

34:53.610 --> 34:55.310
How are we doing on SWAT?

34:55.350 --> 34:56.810
I told them to stay back

34:56.850 --> 34:58.450
till we knew
what we were dealing with.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.350
( phone vibrates )

34:59.380 --> 35:01.480
Eppes.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.290
All right,
Kurt just called Pribitech

35:04.320 --> 35:06.460
-with directions.
-That doesn't make any sense.

35:06.490 --> 35:09.630
Why let Pribitech see his family
before he changes his testimony?

35:09.660 --> 35:12.360
Because he's planning to kill
them all at the same time.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.460
There's got to be hundreds
of pounds of fertilizer

35:14.500 --> 35:15.830
at that trailer.

35:15.870 --> 35:18.730
Let me see.

35:18.770 --> 35:20.740
Oh, yeah, that's an oil bomb.

35:20.770 --> 35:23.370
You think McVeigh,
Oklahoma City.

35:23.410 --> 35:24.910
Did we get a trace?

35:24.940 --> 35:26.680
COLBY ( on phone ):
Done. It's a cell phone.

35:26.710 --> 35:29.410
We have it triangulated down
to one of two towers,

35:29.450 --> 35:30.350
right in your backyard.

35:30.380 --> 35:31.550
I'm going.

35:31.580 --> 35:32.820
Hang on a second, Don.

35:32.850 --> 35:34.250
Hang on,
you're not going anywhere.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.420
If you show up there,
he's going to kill you

35:36.450 --> 35:38.420
and your family with you.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.830
But if De Lock's
watching the trailer...

35:42.860 --> 35:43.630
I know,
we can't approach, right?

35:43.660 --> 35:45.830
How long for a helicopter,
you think?

35:45.860 --> 35:47.400
Half an hour, at least.

35:47.430 --> 35:49.770
Can you, uh,
can you access

35:49.800 --> 35:51.470
a satellite image of the area?

35:51.500 --> 35:53.400
Through DOD, but it's going
to be ten or 15 minutes old.

35:53.440 --> 35:54.370
That's fine.

35:58.510 --> 35:59.740
Okay, the cell phone towers
are where?

35:59.780 --> 36:02.250
Here and here.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.780
Okay, where's Don?

36:03.810 --> 36:06.380
He's right about here.

36:06.420 --> 36:10.390
And the blast radius of
a 50-pound ammonium nitrate bomb

36:10.420 --> 36:12.520
is about like this,
which leaves us

36:12.560 --> 36:14.790
a safety zone right there.

36:18.460 --> 36:20.530
PRIBITECH:
What are you doing?

36:20.560 --> 36:23.600
Among other things,
trying to find a projection

36:23.630 --> 36:25.540
of affine three-space
onto the sphere

36:25.570 --> 36:26.770
subject to some open
constraints.

36:26.800 --> 36:31.910
Assuming that he can't see Don,
but he can see the trailer.

36:33.610 --> 36:35.650
Don,

36:35.680 --> 36:37.380
there's a dirt road

36:37.410 --> 36:40.850
leading to a rise about half a
mile southeast of where you are.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.650
You're going to find him
somewhere along there.

36:42.690 --> 36:44.620
All right, guys,
let's move out.

36:54.930 --> 36:56.370
Let me see these.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.340
All right, guys, let's do it.

37:04.370 --> 37:06.340
They tell me there's
a dirt road back there.

37:06.380 --> 37:07.740
If you stay small, I don't think
they'll see you.

37:07.780 --> 37:09.710
All right, be careful.

37:32.570 --> 37:35.570
We've got a cell phone
activated trigger.

37:35.610 --> 37:37.310
There's no sign of
a pressure plate

37:37.340 --> 37:38.410
or a trip wire.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.710
Let me know
when you're in position.

37:41.810 --> 37:43.810
DON:
I got him.

37:43.850 --> 37:45.380
We're going in.

38:01.330 --> 38:04.830
( phone rings )

38:04.870 --> 38:06.670
COLBY:
This is the FBI.

38:10.570 --> 38:12.410
Don't move.
Don't move an inch.

38:14.340 --> 38:15.380
Put the phone down.

38:15.410 --> 38:16.450
( tires squealing )

38:16.480 --> 38:18.450
DON:
Put it down.

38:18.480 --> 38:21.420
One button
and the trailer blows up.

38:21.450 --> 38:22.750
I pull this trigger,
your head blows up.

38:36.600 --> 38:39.340
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

38:39.370 --> 38:41.440
Back up toward my voice.

38:43.070 --> 38:47.440
COLBY: The Northern Alliance
was already in Kandahar.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.680
The Taliban was running
this rear guard action

38:49.710 --> 38:51.650
out of the Shahi-Kot Mountains.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.450
There were just caves
and bunkers everywhere.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.850
Seemed like every night

38:55.890 --> 38:59.360
these guys would come out
and just pound us with RPGs.

38:59.390 --> 39:02.020
So, finally, one night, we
decided to cut them off

39:02.060 --> 39:04.390
and set up an ambush
in between the base camp

39:04.430 --> 39:07.530
and the pass where they would
go up into the mountains.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.400
No one realized the SAS
was already up there

39:09.430 --> 39:10.870
working that area,

39:10.900 --> 39:13.740
and by the time
they put together our ambush

39:13.770 --> 39:15.970
with their call for help,

39:16.010 --> 39:18.510
there were already
two British soldiers dead.

39:20.510 --> 39:22.880
That doesn't make it your fault.

39:24.550 --> 39:26.780
Then or now.

39:28.780 --> 39:32.860
I know. I know.

39:32.890 --> 39:34.720
( inhales )

39:34.760 --> 39:37.560
We never found out whose bullets
killed our guys up there.

39:37.590 --> 39:43.000
I guess I just made my peace
with not knowing.

39:43.030 --> 39:46.040
They give you
your discharge,

39:46.070 --> 39:48.400
send you home, you go back
to your own life,

39:48.440 --> 39:54.410
and... ( sighs )... you know,
you just think the war is over.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.780
But, man,
it's just always inside of you,

39:56.810 --> 40:01.580
just waiting to come out
when something reminds you.

40:04.590 --> 40:06.560
So what are you going to do?

40:06.590 --> 40:10.160
Guess that depends on how many
more beers we got in that bag.

40:11.490 --> 40:13.730
Enough.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.470
Hey.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.800
Where the hell did evidence
response put the sugar?

40:21.840 --> 40:24.670
I don't know.

40:31.210 --> 40:33.180
Some week.

40:33.220 --> 40:36.990
Yeah. I-I'm cool
until everything quiets down.

40:37.020 --> 40:40.590
Then it's like, my head
is a bad neighborhood to be in.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.600
Hey.

40:46.630 --> 40:48.000
Did you know

40:48.030 --> 40:50.130
that if you bend
a piece of spaghetti,

40:50.170 --> 40:52.200
it'll always break
into three or more pieces?

40:52.230 --> 40:55.040
No, Charlie, I can't say I do.

40:55.070 --> 40:57.740
Richard Feynman
and Danny Hillis

40:57.770 --> 41:00.580
spent an entire night
bending spaghetti.

41:00.610 --> 41:02.550
Took them 20 years to figure out

41:02.580 --> 41:05.880
why you cannot break spaghetti
in half.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.620
And why is that?

41:08.650 --> 41:10.850
Fragmentation theory.

41:10.890 --> 41:12.520
Math stuff.

41:12.560 --> 41:15.560
What's your point?

41:15.590 --> 41:18.130
Not every story has a point.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.600
Sometimes you just
bend spaghetti

41:20.630 --> 41:22.930
to watch it break.

41:24.030 --> 41:26.640
-Oh, yeah, look at that.
-Right?

41:26.670 --> 41:28.170
Hi, Alan.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.940
Looks like the office
is almost back to normal.

41:30.970 --> 41:32.640
Yeah, we're
getting there now.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.980
Who are you looking for,
Don or Charlie?

41:35.010 --> 41:36.680
Oh, I was just in the area,

41:36.710 --> 41:38.710
and I was, uh,
was going to check on, um...

41:38.750 --> 41:39.920
Wait, I did it.

41:39.950 --> 41:41.250
That's not bending it.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.790
You snapped it.
It's not bending.

41:43.820 --> 41:47.120
Actually, I would, uh,
I was going to see

41:47.160 --> 41:48.520
if you'd had dinner yet.

41:48.560 --> 41:49.690
I was just thinking about

41:49.730 --> 41:51.530
some leftover dim sum
in my refrigerator.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.390
Oh, really?

41:52.430 --> 41:53.730
I think we can do
better than that.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.570
Really?
Should we get the boys?

41:55.600 --> 41:56.900
You know what?

41:56.930 --> 41:58.970
They look fine
where they are.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.940
DON:
What about fettuccine?

42:01.970 --> 42:03.970
It works with any pasta.

42:04.010 --> 42:07.140
-Linguini?
-Oh, I'm sure linguini...
