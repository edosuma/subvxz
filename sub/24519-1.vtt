Abigail Miller's office,
this is Caitlyn.

00:24.898 --> 00:26.130
Hi, Karen.

00:26.198 --> 00:27.598
Yes, I know it's Christmas Eve

00:27.634 --> 00:29.700
but she's working on
the fashion show.

00:29.736 --> 00:31.702
Because it's on the 26th.

00:31.738 --> 00:33.571
Well, you're either coming
tonight or open presents

00:33.640 --> 00:35.239
at your desk tomorrow morning.

00:35.274 --> 00:38.910
No, I will not tell our boss
that she's being a grinch.

00:40.313 --> 00:43.247
Karen, I promise you'll be
the first to know when I do.

00:43.883 --> 00:46.617
Fa-la-la-la-la to you, too.

00:46.653 --> 00:47.618
You know what?

00:47.654 --> 00:49.019
She's down in the
art department.

00:49.055 --> 00:50.455
We're supposed to be at your
parent's house in an hour.

00:50.490 --> 00:51.989
I know, my mother keeps texting
me pictures of the turkey

00:52.024 --> 00:53.424
in the oven.

00:53.460 --> 00:54.725
Are those Leighton's dresses?

00:54.761 --> 00:56.627
Yep, all hemmed and tailored,
buffed and polished.

00:56.663 --> 00:58.295
How do they look?

00:58.331 --> 00:59.464
Not bad.

00:59.532 --> 01:00.832
Your designs were a
million times better.

01:00.867 --> 01:03.000
Abigail should really put
you in the fashion show.

01:03.035 --> 01:04.968
Leighton is her daughter and
I am just her assistant.

01:05.037 --> 01:06.537
She barely cares what
my name is let alone

01:06.573 --> 01:08.105
what my designs look like.

01:08.140 --> 01:09.707
You've been working for
her for almost a year.

01:09.742 --> 01:11.108
Have you never even
shown them to her?

01:11.177 --> 01:13.177
Doris, are you crazy?

01:13.212 --> 01:14.979
Your New Year's resolution
should be to believe

01:15.014 --> 01:16.447
in your talent.

01:16.516 --> 01:18.048
I do.

01:18.084 --> 01:20.651
I mostly do.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.021
Showing my designs to Abigail
Miller would be like jumping

01:24.056 --> 01:26.090
in the deep end of
a swimming pool.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.458
Filled with sharks.

01:27.527 --> 01:30.695
Well, by midnight New Year's
Eve I will change your mind.

01:30.763 --> 01:34.465
Right before we get romantic
kisses from two handsome men

01:34.501 --> 01:37.702
at a uh, elegant ball.

01:37.737 --> 01:38.769
What men?

01:38.838 --> 01:39.971
What ball?

01:40.006 --> 01:41.305
We were just planning
on binge watching TV

01:41.340 --> 01:43.541
and eating our
weight in ice cream.

01:43.576 --> 01:44.775
It's New Year's Eve.

01:44.844 --> 01:46.076
Anything's possible.

01:46.145 --> 01:48.479
Ok, the chances of us
getting kissed at midnight

01:48.548 --> 01:51.716
at some fancy New Year's
ball is just as good as

01:51.784 --> 01:53.684
Abigail Miller wanting
to see my dress designs.

01:54.787 --> 01:56.554
Abigail Miller's office,
this is Caitlyn.

01:56.589 --> 01:57.321
Ok, I got it.

01:57.356 --> 01:58.623
She's on her way.

01:58.658 --> 01:59.924
Ok, I am gonna go hide
behind my sewing machine.

01:59.959 --> 02:01.993
And please remind her
that it's Christmas Eve

02:02.028 --> 02:04.795
and that some of us are
on Santa's nice list.

02:18.411 --> 02:18.976
Caitlyn?

02:19.012 --> 02:19.977
Abigail.

02:20.013 --> 02:21.245
I have your messages
and Leighton,

02:21.280 --> 02:22.446
your dresses have arrived.

02:22.481 --> 02:23.748
Oh, thanks, Caitlyn.

02:23.783 --> 02:26.651
I want you to add Lady
Isabelle and Prince Jeffery

02:26.686 --> 02:29.020
to the guest list for
the fashion show.

02:29.055 --> 02:30.154
Who?

02:30.189 --> 02:30.888
They're only one of
the hottest couples

02:30.957 --> 02:32.523
in the world right now.

02:32.559 --> 02:34.124
I don't really pay attention
to that stuff usually.

02:34.193 --> 02:37.695
It's your job to pay attention
to stuff like that.

02:37.764 --> 02:40.364
Anyway, they're here
for the royal family's

02:40.399 --> 02:43.801
New Year's Eve charity
thing and the rumour is

02:43.836 --> 02:45.836
the Prince is going to propose.

02:45.872 --> 02:47.838
On New Year's Eve?

02:47.874 --> 02:49.339
Wow, that's so romantic.

02:49.408 --> 02:50.307
Yes.

02:50.376 --> 02:51.508
Anyway, it'll make
a great cover,

02:51.544 --> 02:54.411
so I want to wow them
at the fashion show.

02:54.447 --> 02:55.947
I'll take care of it.

02:58.250 --> 03:03.087
Abigail... some of the
staff was wondering...

03:03.155 --> 03:04.722
it's- it's Christmas Eve.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.290
And?

03:06.325 --> 03:07.925
And they wanna go home, mom.

03:07.961 --> 03:10.661
We have tons of work to do.

03:10.697 --> 03:11.596
Caitlyn, remind me.

03:11.631 --> 03:12.697
Which one shows up first?

03:12.732 --> 03:14.865
Is it the ghost of
Christmas past?

03:17.236 --> 03:18.202
Fine.

03:18.237 --> 03:19.169
Go be merry.

03:19.205 --> 03:20.204
Thank you.

03:20.239 --> 03:21.538
Merry Christmas.

03:23.309 --> 03:24.374
No.

03:25.211 --> 03:26.677
No.

03:26.713 --> 03:27.845
Definitely not.

03:27.914 --> 03:30.214
Mom, I like that one.

03:30.249 --> 03:32.016
Lady Isabelle is going
to see your dresses

03:32.051 --> 03:35.452
at the fashion show and if
we play our cards right

03:35.521 --> 03:36.821
she's going to be wearing one

03:36.856 --> 03:39.456
when the Prince proposes
to her on New Year's Eve.

03:39.492 --> 03:41.525
Ok. I get it.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.893
But it is Christmas Eve.

03:42.962 --> 03:43.861
Can't this wait?

03:43.930 --> 03:46.063
This could be your big break.

03:46.099 --> 03:49.767
This is much more
important than Christmas.

03:49.802 --> 03:51.636
Let's get to work.

03:56.909 --> 03:58.509
Caitlyn, we're late!

03:58.544 --> 04:02.046
I know, my mother just sent me
a picture of a kitchen timer.

04:02.081 --> 04:04.115
Wait until you see how
much food she made.

04:04.150 --> 04:06.283
We're gonna have
leftovers for weeks.

04:06.318 --> 04:08.585
Oh, the freezer's already
full with all the food that

04:08.621 --> 04:10.487
my folks sent home
after Thanksgiving.

04:10.523 --> 04:11.822
I can bring some to work.

04:11.858 --> 04:13.557
We work at a fashion magazine.

04:13.592 --> 04:14.792
Nobody there eats.

04:14.861 --> 04:16.459
Ok, no telling jokes
like that tonight.

04:16.495 --> 04:18.195
My parents are already
freaked out that I quit

04:18.230 --> 04:20.430
my steady teaching job
to work in fashion.

04:20.499 --> 04:22.466
Well, have they
seen your designs?

04:22.501 --> 04:23.734
Yeah, they think they're cute.

04:23.770 --> 04:24.568
What?

04:24.603 --> 04:26.236
They're beautiful.

04:26.272 --> 04:28.773
Lady Isabelle should
see this one.

04:28.808 --> 04:30.374
The Prince would take
one look at her in this

04:30.409 --> 04:31.876
and propose on the spot.

04:31.911 --> 04:34.145
Ok, we have to go otherwise
my mother is going to send us

04:34.180 --> 04:36.480
a picture of her weeping
over a burned turkey.

04:36.515 --> 04:37.682
Ok, ok.

04:37.717 --> 04:39.183
Ok, ok.

04:42.421 --> 04:44.889
Someday your prince will come.

05:01.007 --> 05:02.639
Who's home is this again?

05:02.675 --> 05:04.408
Lord and Lady Atwood.

05:04.443 --> 05:06.711
You met them at the
opera a few months ago.

05:06.779 --> 05:07.745
Oh, yes.

05:07.780 --> 05:09.246
I think it was a
race to determine

05:09.281 --> 05:12.116
which would put me
to sleep faster.

05:12.151 --> 05:14.284
Them or the opera.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.821
Luckily they are vacationing
in Italy and have given you

05:16.856 --> 05:19.156
free run of the place
and a suitable venue

05:19.192 --> 05:20.891
for the New Year's Eve ball.

05:20.927 --> 05:23.327
I suppose it's appropriate given
what everyone's expecting me

05:23.362 --> 05:25.229
to do at this year's ball.

05:25.264 --> 05:27.564
It is a tradition in your
family, Your Highness.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.366
All the men have proposed
on New Year's Eve.

05:29.435 --> 05:31.468
I'm painfully aware of
the traditions, Barnaby.

05:31.503 --> 05:34.371
I've lived my entire life
within their strict confines.

05:34.406 --> 05:36.473
It's just that
sometimes I wish that-

05:36.508 --> 05:38.175
Let me show you both

05:38.211 --> 05:40.344
where the New Year's Eve
ball will take place.

05:40.379 --> 05:42.613
Hello, darling.

05:42.648 --> 05:44.749
Did you get settled in
your room, Lady Isabelle?

05:44.817 --> 05:46.117
Yes, I did, Barnaby.

05:46.152 --> 05:47.351
Thank you.

05:47.419 --> 05:49.353
We must make sure to thank
Lord and Lady Atwood

05:49.388 --> 05:51.521
for their generosity.

05:51.557 --> 05:54.625
Oh, Jeffery, we should
take them to the opera.

05:54.693 --> 05:55.993
Wouldn't that be fun?

05:56.028 --> 05:58.028
Yes, it would be.

06:03.335 --> 06:06.536
Oh, Jeffery.

06:06.572 --> 06:08.605
Oh, this room is
beautiful, isn't it?

06:08.641 --> 06:09.807
Yes, it is.

06:09.842 --> 06:11.242
This will make a wonderful
place for you to host

06:11.277 --> 06:12.643
the New Year's Eve gala.

06:12.678 --> 06:14.344
We have so much to do.

06:14.380 --> 06:16.781
Interview caterers,
choose an orchestra...

06:16.849 --> 06:18.015
I have to find a dress.

06:18.050 --> 06:19.917
Isabelle, darling,
it's Christmas Eve.

06:19.952 --> 06:21.218
Perhaps we could
put a pin in that

06:21.254 --> 06:22.787
until after the holiday?

06:22.855 --> 06:25.055
Jeffery, this is
quite important.

06:25.124 --> 06:26.556
We must make sure that
everything is perfect

06:26.592 --> 06:28.558
when the king arrives
on New Year's Eve.

06:28.594 --> 06:30.527
Yes, of course.

06:36.635 --> 06:38.235
I'm still full.

06:38.271 --> 06:39.937
I told you not to have seconds.

06:40.006 --> 06:43.740
I think it would have made
your mom cry if I didn't.

06:43.776 --> 06:44.741
Oh, hello, Abigail.

06:44.777 --> 06:45.976
How was-

06:46.012 --> 06:47.044
Do you have the updated
guest list for tonight?

06:47.113 --> 06:48.779
Yes, I have that right here.

06:48.815 --> 06:49.446
Hi, Leighton.

06:49.481 --> 06:50.281
How was your Christmas?

06:50.349 --> 06:51.581
Jingle all the way.

06:51.650 --> 06:54.151
Let me know the moment
Lady Isabelle arrives.

06:54.187 --> 06:57.021
And Doris, I think we should do
another fitting for the models.

06:57.056 --> 06:57.988
We've already done two.

06:58.024 --> 06:59.089
Well, let's do three.

06:59.125 --> 07:01.225
It has to be perfect.

07:02.394 --> 07:06.163
Caitlyn, why is this
Christmas tree here?

07:06.232 --> 07:08.032
Because it was
Christmas yesterday?

07:08.067 --> 07:10.301
Yesterday is like wearing
last year's fashions.

07:10.336 --> 07:11.802
Get rid of it.

07:13.039 --> 07:15.272
Somebody got coal
in their stocking.

07:15.308 --> 07:16.640
Mmmhmm.

07:21.580 --> 07:22.713
Hello.

07:22.748 --> 07:24.581
Lady Isabelle Collins
for Abigail Miller.

07:24.650 --> 07:25.950
Hello. Welcome.

07:25.985 --> 07:26.717
Thank you.

07:26.752 --> 07:28.752
Lady Isabelle?

07:28.787 --> 07:30.354
I didn't know you were here.

07:30.389 --> 07:33.090
Caitlyn, why didn't you
tell me she was here?

07:33.125 --> 07:35.492
Well, I hope you're
ready for this evening.

07:35.527 --> 07:39.563
We are going to have some
amazing designs for you to see.

07:39.598 --> 07:41.265
Hopefully I'll fall in
love with one of them

07:41.334 --> 07:43.300
for the prince's New
Year's Eve gala.

07:43.336 --> 07:46.237
I want to look stunning
when he, well,

07:46.272 --> 07:48.705
when whatever happens
that evening happens.

07:48.774 --> 07:51.441
Yes, let's talk about that.

07:51.477 --> 07:54.711
Oh, I- I forgot my notebook with
all my plans for the party.

07:54.747 --> 07:56.146
A messenger should
be bringing it.

07:56.215 --> 07:58.015
Caitlyn, go downstairs and
wait for the messenger.

07:58.050 --> 07:59.183
Ok, I'll take care of that.

07:59.218 --> 08:00.150
They'll be carrying a red book.

08:00.186 --> 08:01.451
You can't miss it.

08:01.487 --> 08:02.786
Good.

08:03.822 --> 08:05.655
So, I've been thinking about...

08:09.195 --> 08:10.560
The messenger would
have delivered

08:10.629 --> 08:11.996
the notebook, Your Highness.

08:12.031 --> 08:14.564
I know, Barnaby, but I wanted
to get out of the hotel.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.699
It's New York City.

08:15.734 --> 08:17.902
I'd like to experience
it while I'm here.

08:17.937 --> 08:19.303
You have a busy schedule today,

08:19.372 --> 08:21.171
are you sure you don't want
to change into something

08:21.207 --> 08:22.639
more befitting your position?

08:22.674 --> 08:24.474
Are you saying I look
like a commoner?

08:24.543 --> 08:25.943
Never, Your Highness.

08:25.978 --> 08:28.145
You look like a man
with a purpose.

08:28.180 --> 08:29.914
Perhaps an unshaven one

08:29.949 --> 08:32.682
but a man with a
purpose nonetheless.

08:32.717 --> 08:34.484
Barnaby, I've spent
my entire life

08:34.520 --> 08:36.820
being treated like a prince.

08:36.855 --> 08:38.289
That's a bad thing?

08:38.323 --> 08:43.894
No, but just this once, in a
city where nobody knows me,

08:43.962 --> 08:47.031
I don't want to be Prince
Jeffery, house of Wallingford

08:47.066 --> 08:49.166
next in line to the crown.

08:49.201 --> 08:52.469
I just want to be... Jeff.

08:54.006 --> 08:55.306
I could be Jeff.

08:55.341 --> 08:57.474
You can be anything you
want to be, Your Highness.

08:57.543 --> 08:59.176
Now you're just humouring me.

08:59.211 --> 09:01.678
No, I would never do that.

09:04.516 --> 09:06.317
Here we are.

09:06.352 --> 09:07.918
Jeff.

09:35.081 --> 09:36.313
Oh.

09:38.550 --> 09:39.483
Hi, excuse me?

09:39.518 --> 09:40.784
Is that for Lady
Isabelle Collins?

09:40.819 --> 09:41.785
Why, yes it is.

09:41.820 --> 09:42.586
I'll take that.

09:42.621 --> 09:43.920
I'm- I'm sorry, who are you?

09:43.990 --> 09:45.022
I'm Abigail Miller's assistant
and they are waiting

09:45.057 --> 09:46.023
for that upstairs.

09:46.092 --> 09:47.291
I really should
take it up myself.

09:47.326 --> 09:48.558
They sent me down to get it.

09:48.594 --> 09:49.593
You see, Isabelle is-

09:49.661 --> 09:50.961
Waiting for me to bring her

09:50.997 --> 09:52.562
that notebook and she strikes
me as the kind of woman

09:52.598 --> 09:54.298
that gets what she wants.

09:54.333 --> 09:54.999
Does she?

09:55.034 --> 09:55.832
Oh, yes.

09:55.868 --> 09:57.134
I mean, she's dating a prince.

09:57.169 --> 09:58.469
How do you even meet a prince?

09:58.504 --> 10:00.504
Is there, like, a dating
app for that or something?

10:00.539 --> 10:01.538
Probably.

10:01.573 --> 10:03.673
Anyway, they are
waiting for this so...

10:03.742 --> 10:04.975
You don't understand.

10:05.044 --> 10:06.410
I wanted to meet Miss
Miller because I'm-

10:06.479 --> 10:07.644
I get it.

10:07.679 --> 10:09.813
You're a model, and you
think that if you get

10:09.882 --> 10:11.581
in front of the editor
of Appliqué magazine

10:11.650 --> 10:13.217
she'll put you on
the next cover?

10:13.285 --> 10:14.418
Model, really?

10:14.453 --> 10:16.887
You're a very handsome
guy, I'll admit that,

10:16.922 --> 10:18.955
but the last person that tried
to slip Abigail a headshot

10:18.991 --> 10:20.491
got carried out by security.

10:20.559 --> 10:21.258
Oh dear.

10:21.293 --> 10:22.493
Yes.

10:22.528 --> 10:23.627
And they are waiting for
this notebook upstairs

10:23.662 --> 10:24.928
and if I'm not there
in a couple minutes

10:24.963 --> 10:26.696
I will be the one
being carried out.

10:26.732 --> 10:27.864
Well, we wouldn't want that.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.533
No.

10:29.568 --> 10:30.700
Two conditions.

10:30.769 --> 10:31.668
Ok, what?

10:31.737 --> 10:35.372
One, you have to
tell me your name.

10:35.441 --> 10:36.407
Caitlyn.

10:36.442 --> 10:37.941
And I suppose the
second condition

10:37.976 --> 10:39.109
is I'll have to
give you my number.

10:39.178 --> 10:39.976
No, no.

10:40.012 --> 10:41.378
It's as simple as this.

10:41.447 --> 10:43.280
You must promise me that
the next time we meet

10:43.315 --> 10:46.116
you won't be embarrassed by
what has transpired here today.

10:46.152 --> 10:48.085
What makes you think
we will meet again?

10:48.120 --> 10:50.120
And why would I be embarrassed?

10:50.189 --> 10:51.155
Just a hunch.

10:51.190 --> 10:52.189
Ok, deal.

10:52.224 --> 10:54.391
Now, can I please
have the notebook?

10:54.427 --> 10:56.993
My name is Jeff, by the way.

10:57.029 --> 10:59.263
Well, thank you, Jeff.

10:59.298 --> 11:01.898
I'll be sure to give you
a good review on Yelp.

11:17.416 --> 11:18.182
Hello?

11:18.217 --> 11:18.982
Doris. Have you left yet?

11:19.017 --> 11:19.983
<i>Just leaving the house.</i>

11:20.018 --> 11:20.850
Oh, good.

11:20.919 --> 11:22.286
I need you to bring me a dress.

11:22.321 --> 11:23.353
Why?

11:23.389 --> 11:24.321
What's wrong with
what you're wearing?

11:24.356 --> 11:25.389
Abigail said I look
like a waitress

11:25.458 --> 11:27.558
from an all-you-can-eat buffet.

11:27.593 --> 11:29.693
So we're guessing her
New Year's resolution

11:29.728 --> 11:31.295
is to be less mean.

11:31.330 --> 11:32.596
<i>Please just bring me a dress.</i>

11:32.631 --> 11:33.630
Ok, well which one?

11:33.699 --> 11:34.598
I don't know, any of them.

11:34.666 --> 11:37.534
Um... the red one.

11:37.603 --> 11:38.502
The red one?

11:38.571 --> 11:39.603
Oh, really?

11:39.638 --> 11:40.971
Doris, please just pick one.

11:41.006 --> 11:42.272
Ok.

11:56.255 --> 11:57.721
Oh, Doris, what
took you so long?

11:57.756 --> 11:59.490
All the guests have already
arrived and Abigail won't let me

11:59.525 --> 12:00.624
in the ballroom until I change.

12:00.659 --> 12:01.291
Sorry.

12:01.327 --> 12:02.493
Here.

12:03.596 --> 12:04.328
Doris, what did you do?

12:04.363 --> 12:05.662
This is one of my dresses.

12:05.697 --> 12:07.897
It's beautiful and,
more importantly,

12:07.933 --> 12:09.533
it's too late to do
anything about it.

12:09.568 --> 12:12.068
Oh, I am gonna get you
so good for this.

12:12.104 --> 12:14.004
Ok, I'm gonna be backstage with
a bunch of size zero models.

12:14.039 --> 12:16.006
I'm already being punished.

12:17.176 --> 12:18.742
There they are,
the happy couple.

12:18.777 --> 12:22.412
Oh, Jeffery, this is Abigail
Miller from Appliqué magazine.

12:22.448 --> 12:23.413
Your highness.

12:23.449 --> 12:24.548
She has graciously
offered to help

12:24.583 --> 12:25.849
with the New Year's Eve gala.

12:25.884 --> 12:27.317
Wonderful.

12:27.353 --> 12:29.119
You know it's a benefit for
the royal family foundation

12:29.155 --> 12:31.221
which funds a number
of youth programs,

12:31.257 --> 12:33.023
scholarships, on-the-job-

12:33.091 --> 12:34.924
Jeffery, she doesn't
need the sales pitch.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.227
She's already agreed.

12:37.296 --> 12:40.631
Any assistance you can give
will help a lot of people.

12:40.699 --> 12:42.533
Well, we're all about helping.

12:42.568 --> 12:44.901
And we want to make sure
that we do anything we can

12:44.936 --> 12:46.203
to make you happy.

12:46.238 --> 12:48.405
Lady Isabelle, I want you
to pay special attention

12:48.474 --> 12:51.208
tonight to the fashions
from Leighton Miller.

12:51.243 --> 12:52.509
Oh, fashion talk.

12:52.545 --> 12:53.577
That's my cue.

12:53.646 --> 12:54.478
Excuse me.

12:57.283 --> 13:00.217
Oh, Jeffery!

13:00.286 --> 13:02.752
You clumsy man, you ruined
the Prince's jacket.

13:02.788 --> 13:03.554
No, no, no.

13:03.589 --> 13:04.754
It was all my fault.

13:04.823 --> 13:05.556
Are you ok?

13:05.624 --> 13:06.456
I'm so sorry.

13:06.492 --> 13:07.924
I'm fine, thank you.

13:07.959 --> 13:10.460
Yes, your jacket has taken
quite a hit, Your Highness.

13:10.496 --> 13:12.028
Oh dear.

13:12.097 --> 13:14.698
Ladies, you'll have to
excuse me while I go try

13:14.733 --> 13:16.733
to make myself a little
more presentable.

13:16.802 --> 13:18.235
Alright.

13:19.572 --> 13:21.037
Oh dear.

13:29.081 --> 13:31.615
I'm afraid this is not going
to work, Your Highness.

13:31.684 --> 13:35.085
Yes, I think the shrimp
cocktail won this round.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.720
I'll go check with the
hotel to see if they have

13:36.755 --> 13:38.622
something that might
get this out.

13:38.657 --> 13:39.590
Thank you, Barnaby.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.425
I'll wait for you in the hall.

14:10.556 --> 14:11.655
Oh, I didn't-

14:11.690 --> 14:12.389
I'm so sorry!

14:12.458 --> 14:13.123
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:13.158 --> 14:17.060
No, I'm- that... you.

14:17.095 --> 14:19.162
What- what're you doing here?

14:19.197 --> 14:20.096
Actually, I'm-

14:20.132 --> 14:21.598
Oh, I get it.

14:21.667 --> 14:25.101
You're a messenger by day,
cater waiter at night?

14:25.137 --> 14:26.703
Very perceptive, Caitlyn.

14:26.739 --> 14:28.338
I know you're trying to
make it in this business

14:28.374 --> 14:30.741
but this is not
the way to do it.

14:30.776 --> 14:32.776
Alright, what would you suggest?

14:32.844 --> 14:34.611
Do you have an agent
or a manager?

14:34.647 --> 14:36.079
Someone that looks out for you?

14:36.114 --> 14:36.780
Yes.

14:36.815 --> 14:37.881
His name's Barnaby.

14:37.916 --> 14:39.416
Great.

14:39.485 --> 14:40.950
Well, then he needs to be out
making contacts on your behalf.

14:40.986 --> 14:43.119
You need to make him work for
you, because the chances

14:43.188 --> 14:46.757
of you meeting someone important
here are pretty slim.

14:46.792 --> 14:48.558
I met you.

14:48.594 --> 14:49.926
Right.

14:49.995 --> 14:53.163
Well, if you think I'm important
you really do need help.

14:58.437 --> 15:02.639
I do know all of the great
modeling agencies in this town

15:02.675 --> 15:05.141
and I'm sure that one would
be happy to sit down

15:05.210 --> 15:06.242
and talk with you.

15:06.278 --> 15:08.011
You would do that for me?

15:08.046 --> 15:11.281
I know what it's like to want to
be something more than you are.

15:11.350 --> 15:15.786
So give me a call after the
holidays at the magazine.

15:15.821 --> 15:17.053
I'm not giving you my number.

15:17.088 --> 15:18.154
I didn't ask.

15:18.190 --> 15:20.256
By the way, the
dress is beautiful.

15:20.292 --> 15:22.526
You look lovely.

15:22.561 --> 15:23.860
Thank you.

15:23.895 --> 15:26.296
I'm still not giving
you my number.

15:30.969 --> 15:32.669
Caitlyn should be any minute.

15:32.705 --> 15:33.303
I'm here, I'm here.

15:33.372 --> 15:34.237
I'm sorry.

15:34.272 --> 15:35.071
It's about time.

15:35.140 --> 15:36.005
We should start the show.

15:36.041 --> 15:36.940
I know, I'm sorry.

15:36.975 --> 15:38.041
Hello, Lady Isabelle.

15:38.076 --> 15:40.377
Caitlyn, your dress is stunning.

15:40.412 --> 15:41.678
Thank you.

15:41.714 --> 15:43.079
This is exactly the sort
of thing I'd like to wear

15:43.114 --> 15:44.681
to the New Year's Eve party.

15:44.717 --> 15:46.850
Where did you get it?

15:46.885 --> 15:47.751
Actually, I-

15:47.786 --> 15:49.386
Did you take it from the office?

15:49.421 --> 15:50.687
Is that one of our spring line?

15:50.723 --> 15:52.689
Caitlyn designed it.

15:52.725 --> 15:54.090
Doris.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.692
You did?

15:55.728 --> 15:57.728
Caitlyn, this is gorgeous.

15:57.796 --> 15:58.662
Thank you.

15:58.697 --> 15:59.929
Do you have others?

15:59.965 --> 16:01.565
I'd love to wear something
like it to my party.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.599
What now?

16:02.668 --> 16:05.168
Yes, she has lots
of other designs.

16:05.237 --> 16:06.236
Wouldn't you like to wait

16:06.271 --> 16:07.604
until you see the
show this evening?

16:07.673 --> 16:09.138
Oh, well, certainly.

16:09.174 --> 16:11.408
But if Caitlyn's other
designs are this good...

16:11.443 --> 16:14.644
Caitlyn, shall we meet tomorrow
to go over what you have?

16:16.849 --> 16:17.781
Yeah, sure.

16:17.816 --> 16:19.148
That would- that would be great.

16:19.184 --> 16:22.185
Text me your location and
a time and I'll be there.

16:22.220 --> 16:23.687
Great.

16:25.791 --> 16:26.823
Abigail, I didn't-

16:26.859 --> 16:28.124
We just need to get
the show started.

16:28.159 --> 16:28.958
Right.

16:29.027 --> 16:30.159
I'll go tell the stage manager.

16:30.195 --> 16:31.661
No, I want you to go
backstage with Doris.

16:31.697 --> 16:33.329
And you help Leighton.

16:33.399 --> 16:35.265
And I want you to stay there.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.800
Everything has to go smoothly.

16:36.835 --> 16:38.802
Ok, I can do that.

16:40.272 --> 16:41.237
Did that just happen?

16:41.273 --> 16:42.572
That just happened!

16:42.641 --> 16:44.340
Lady Isabelle will be
wearing one of your dresses

16:44.410 --> 16:46.109
when the prince asks
her to marry him.

16:46.177 --> 16:48.445
I don't even know
what to do with that.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.179
Abigail does not
look very happy.

16:50.215 --> 16:51.080
Who cares?

16:51.116 --> 16:51.782
I care.

16:51.850 --> 16:52.649
She's my boss.

16:52.684 --> 16:53.483
What if she fires me?

16:53.519 --> 16:54.584
She's not gonna fire you.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.787
She just exiled you backstage.

16:56.855 --> 16:58.021
Although I guess this means
you're not gonna get

16:58.056 --> 16:59.022
to meet the prince.

16:59.057 --> 17:00.624
Oh, I am so ok with that.

17:00.659 --> 17:03.894
I've had enough fairy
tale for one evening.

17:06.932 --> 17:08.131
Here you are, Your Highness.

17:08.199 --> 17:10.233
Oh, thank you, Barnaby.

17:29.972 --> 17:30.804
Oh, hello?

17:30.839 --> 17:32.639
Good, someone found my phone.

17:32.708 --> 17:35.041
Hi, uh, that's my phone.

17:35.077 --> 17:35.976
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

17:36.011 --> 17:37.343
<i>Hello, Caitlyn.</i>

17:37.378 --> 17:41.948
Wait... is... Jeff?

17:41.984 --> 17:44.784
You said you weren't going to
give me your phone number.

17:44.853 --> 17:46.185
And technically I didn't.

17:46.221 --> 17:48.955
I just gave you my
entire phone, it seems.

17:48.991 --> 17:50.090
I suppose you want it back?

17:50.125 --> 17:51.157
Yes, please.

17:51.192 --> 17:52.525
Um, I can come to you.

17:52.594 --> 17:54.393
No, no.

17:54.429 --> 17:56.796
My place is a mess.

17:56.832 --> 17:58.765
<i>I was heading out shortly
soon, I could drop it by.</i>

17:58.800 --> 17:59.565
Really?

17:59.601 --> 18:00.566
That would be great.

18:00.602 --> 18:02.002
I need to get ready
for a meeting.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.004
I'll text my address
to the phone.

18:04.039 --> 18:04.804
Alright then.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.405
See you soon.

18:11.246 --> 18:12.679
So, wait.

18:12.714 --> 18:14.380
A future princess wants
one of your designs

18:14.449 --> 18:17.617
and a cute model answers
your phone when you call it?

18:17.686 --> 18:19.019
You should buy a lottery ticket.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.053
Right?

18:20.122 --> 18:21.655
Uh, speaking of future princess,

18:21.723 --> 18:23.589
I have to call Lady Isabelle.

18:23.625 --> 18:25.125
Oooh.

18:26.762 --> 18:29.195
Yes, that would work perfect.

18:29.230 --> 18:30.664
I'll see you then.

18:30.699 --> 18:32.132
Thank you.

18:32.167 --> 18:34.367
That was the designer that I
told you about last night.

18:34.402 --> 18:35.501
Designer?

18:35.537 --> 18:36.636
Yes.

18:36.672 --> 18:38.672
The one with the dress
that I liked so much.

18:38.740 --> 18:39.873
I have a few errands
to run first

18:39.908 --> 18:41.641
but perhaps we could
meet for lunch.

18:41.677 --> 18:43.643
Sounds lovely.

18:43.679 --> 18:47.480
Where are you off to
dressed so casually?

18:47.515 --> 18:49.482
I'm returning a lost mobile.

18:49.517 --> 18:50.717
Oh.

18:50.752 --> 18:51.417
Why don't you have one
of the staff to do it?

18:51.452 --> 18:52.052
I'm sure that Barnaby-

18:52.087 --> 18:52.819
No, no, no, no, no.

18:52.854 --> 18:54.654
I'd rather do it myself.

18:54.690 --> 18:56.056
Why?

18:56.091 --> 18:57.223
That's not the sort of thing
a prince should be doing.

18:57.258 --> 18:58.624
That's why.

18:58.660 --> 19:03.997
I like the idea of doing
things regular people do.

19:04.032 --> 19:06.632
Yes, but we're not
regular people.

19:06.668 --> 19:08.201
Doesn't that bother
you a little?

19:08.236 --> 19:10.303
No, not in the slightest.

19:10.338 --> 19:12.205
Hmm.

19:16.945 --> 19:23.049
Well, I like the idea of being
regular every now and then.

19:23.085 --> 19:24.017
I will see you at lunch.

19:24.052 --> 19:25.551
Yes.

19:29.457 --> 19:32.658
Lady Isabelle will be here
in a couple of hours.

19:33.361 --> 19:34.227
Lady Isabelle.

19:34.262 --> 19:35.528
that is so cool.

19:35.563 --> 19:37.030
See, I knew it would just
take someone with taste

19:37.065 --> 19:38.297
seeing your work.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.833
Oh, she definitely has taste.

19:39.901 --> 19:41.400
She is so elegant.

19:41.436 --> 19:43.336
I feel like a bull in a
china shop around her.

19:43.371 --> 19:44.437
Did you even see the prince?

19:44.472 --> 19:45.872
No.

19:45.907 --> 19:47.974
Abigail didn't let me come out
front by the time they left.

19:48.009 --> 19:50.076
Well, maybe he'll come with her.

19:50.112 --> 19:51.477
Mmm.

19:52.748 --> 19:56.482
Oh, we need to straighten up.

19:56.551 --> 20:00.319
Yeah, it might just be
easier if we moved.

20:00.355 --> 20:00.920
Ok.

20:00.956 --> 20:01.621
Oh- Oh-

20:01.656 --> 20:03.356
Kitchen.

20:13.902 --> 20:15.835
Are you sure you don't want
me to return the phone,

20:15.871 --> 20:16.836
Your Highness?

20:16.872 --> 20:18.671
No, this will just
take a minute.

20:28.549 --> 20:29.682
You were right.

20:29.751 --> 20:32.152
We meet again and I am
indeed embarrassed.

20:32.187 --> 20:35.889
This isn't precisely
what I meant but...

20:35.924 --> 20:38.457
Hello.

20:38.493 --> 20:39.959
Oh, Doris, this is Jeff.

20:39.995 --> 20:42.028
Um, Jeff, this is
my roommate, Doris.

20:42.063 --> 20:44.297
Lovely to meet you.

20:44.332 --> 20:46.966
Why do you look so familiar?

20:47.002 --> 20:49.402
You must have been in a
magazine or something.

20:49.470 --> 20:51.637
I've been in a few, yes.

20:51.673 --> 20:53.739
Well, that must be it then.

20:53.775 --> 20:57.076
Anyway, thank you again
for returning this.

20:57.112 --> 20:58.611
Do you want me to give you
a reward or something?

20:58.646 --> 20:59.445
No, no.

20:59.514 --> 21:00.379
It's not necessary.

21:00.415 --> 21:01.881
You came all the way down here.

21:01.950 --> 21:04.350
Really, it was no bother.

21:04.385 --> 21:07.287
Maybe you could buy
him a cup of coffee?

21:08.924 --> 21:11.858
We need to get our place ready
for our visitor, remember?

21:11.893 --> 21:13.659
Well, I can take
care of that and...

21:13.695 --> 21:15.862
you want a cup of coffee,
don't you, Jeff?

21:15.897 --> 21:18.965
As a matter of fact, I do.

21:21.469 --> 21:25.571
Ok, I shall get my coat then.

21:27.242 --> 21:27.941
Here.

21:27.976 --> 21:30.844
I'll need to help you.

21:30.912 --> 21:32.712
Thank you.

21:33.748 --> 21:36.549
You know that this is
just me saying thank you.

21:36.584 --> 21:38.251
We're not...

21:38.286 --> 21:39.219
Oh, no.

21:39.254 --> 21:41.354
Of course not.

21:42.757 --> 21:45.491
Besides, I'm seeing someone,
so no ulterior motives.

21:45.526 --> 21:47.426
Ok.

21:47.462 --> 21:48.895
Doris, I'll see you later.

21:49.865 --> 21:50.696
Lovely to meet you.

21:50.732 --> 21:51.497
You, too.

21:51.532 --> 21:52.932
Have fun.

22:10.485 --> 22:12.986
Oh my... ok.

22:15.957 --> 22:16.622
Pick up.

22:16.691 --> 22:17.257
Pick up!

22:19.995 --> 22:21.127
No!

22:22.230 --> 22:23.562
Ok.

22:23.598 --> 22:25.164
Oh my gosh.

22:34.175 --> 22:34.840
There you go.

22:34.876 --> 22:36.175
Thank you.

22:40.181 --> 22:41.514
Mmm.

22:41.549 --> 22:43.649
This is good coffee.

22:43.718 --> 22:45.484
I'll have to
remember this place.

22:45.520 --> 22:51.024
There's one on, like, every four
blocks so it won't be hard.

22:51.059 --> 22:54.294
Shall we sit?

22:54.329 --> 22:56.262
Sure.

23:02.437 --> 23:04.370
We don't have these
back at home.

23:04.439 --> 23:05.805
You don't?

23:05.840 --> 23:07.540
I thought you were from Britain.

23:07.575 --> 23:08.241
Your accent.

23:08.310 --> 23:09.342
No.

23:09.377 --> 23:12.711
No, I'm from a small
country in Europe.

23:12.747 --> 23:14.080
Most people have
never heard of it.

23:14.149 --> 23:16.115
I'm only in New York
for a short while.

23:16.151 --> 23:18.717
Oh, well, how are you
liking it so far?

23:18.753 --> 23:20.053
I love it.

23:20.121 --> 23:23.256
It's so energetic and colourful.

23:23.291 --> 23:24.857
There's just so much to do.

23:24.892 --> 23:29.295
Why, yesterday I
took the subway.

23:29.364 --> 23:31.697
You- you've never
ridden a subway?

23:31.732 --> 23:32.765
No.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.435
It was amazing.

23:35.503 --> 23:39.439
It was a little crowded and
there were some unusual smells

23:39.474 --> 23:43.443
but uh, besides that it
was quite an adventure.

23:43.478 --> 23:44.910
It can be.

23:44.946 --> 23:47.080
Maybe next time you
can take a cab.

23:48.283 --> 23:52.251
So what is it like
working in fashion?

23:52.287 --> 23:53.719
It seems so glamorous.

23:53.788 --> 23:57.090
Well, I'm just an assistant so
I haven't really experienced

23:57.125 --> 23:58.824
the glamour part of it all yet.

23:58.860 --> 23:59.658
Yet?

23:59.694 --> 24:01.127
What are your aspirations?

24:01.162 --> 24:03.329
I wanna be a designer.

24:03.365 --> 24:04.297
Hmm.

24:04.332 --> 24:05.631
I mean, I am a designer,

24:05.666 --> 24:08.134
I just haven't had much
success in it yet.

24:08.203 --> 24:10.370
But I'm hoping that that's
all about to change.

24:10.405 --> 24:11.270
Really?

24:11.306 --> 24:13.306
I have this amazing opportunity.

24:13.375 --> 24:14.440
I don't wanna talk
too much about it

24:14.509 --> 24:15.674
because I don't wanna jinx it

24:15.710 --> 24:18.378
but it could really be a
new beginning for me.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.246
That's exciting.

24:20.281 --> 24:22.815
Well, not as exciting
as riding the subway.

24:22.850 --> 24:23.516
No.

24:23.551 --> 24:25.385
No, it's not.

24:27.322 --> 24:29.422
So you said you're
seeing somebody?

24:29.457 --> 24:31.757
Yes, for a couple years now.

24:31.826 --> 24:33.292
Sounds serious.

24:33.328 --> 24:34.760
Yes.

24:34.795 --> 24:37.397
There may be an engagement soon.

24:37.432 --> 24:38.731
Really?

24:38.766 --> 24:40.233
Have you decided how you're
gonna pop the question?

24:40.268 --> 24:42.768
It's actually been
decided for me.

24:42.837 --> 24:44.837
How does that happen?

24:44.872 --> 24:46.572
It's a tradition of sorts.

24:46.607 --> 24:48.241
All the men in my family
have proposed just

24:48.276 --> 24:51.310
before the stroke of
midnight on New Year's Eve.

24:51.346 --> 24:52.245
Really?

24:52.280 --> 24:53.413
That's so romantic.

24:53.448 --> 24:56.115
It's supposed to
symbolize a fresh start.

24:56.151 --> 24:58.451
A new beginning, so to speak.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.319
Two lives becoming one.

25:00.355 --> 25:03.222
That's crazy romantic.

25:03.258 --> 25:06.025
I'm totally stealing
that when I get engaged.

25:06.061 --> 25:07.593
Is that happening soon?

25:07.628 --> 25:09.595
Considering I'm not
even dating anybody?

25:09.630 --> 25:10.963
No.

25:10.998 --> 25:12.998
Not this New Year's
Eve, that's for sure.

25:13.034 --> 25:14.534
There will be more.

25:14.569 --> 25:18.003
You know, I hear they
have one every year.

25:20.108 --> 25:21.974
Well, this is me.

25:22.009 --> 25:25.044
So thank you for
rescuing my phone,

25:25.080 --> 25:26.879
which I must have left upstairs.

25:26.914 --> 25:28.514
I leave that everywhere.

25:28.550 --> 25:29.482
It's like a sickness.

25:29.517 --> 25:30.783
I really need help.

25:30.818 --> 25:32.418
Perhaps that could be your
New Year's resolution.

25:32.454 --> 25:34.019
You know, it's almost as
good as getting engaged

25:34.055 --> 25:36.755
at the stroke of midnight.

25:36.791 --> 25:38.057
Thanks again.

25:38.093 --> 25:38.757
Good luck.

25:38.826 --> 25:39.692
Jeffery.

25:39.727 --> 25:40.426
Isabelle.

25:40.462 --> 25:41.160
What're you doing here?

25:41.229 --> 25:42.228
Well, I told you.

25:42.263 --> 25:43.762
I was meeting with the
designer, Caitlyn.

25:43.831 --> 25:44.830
Wait, you're-

25:44.865 --> 25:47.700
Is everything alright,
Your Highness?

25:47.735 --> 25:48.634
Highness?

25:48.669 --> 25:49.802
He's the prince!

25:49.837 --> 25:52.171
He's the- he's the prince.

25:59.681 --> 26:02.140
Oh, Jeffery, you should
be ashamed of yourself

26:02.153 --> 26:04.119
not telling her who
you really are.

26:04.155 --> 26:05.420
I know.

26:05.455 --> 26:07.089
I'm truly sorry.

26:07.158 --> 26:11.393
No problem, your... excellency?

26:11.428 --> 26:13.195
You call him "Your Highness".

26:13.230 --> 26:14.963
Please, just call me Jeffery.

26:14.999 --> 26:16.531
Not Jeff?

26:16.567 --> 26:17.866
Um, no.

26:17.902 --> 26:20.803
Jeff is busy with his
modeling career.

26:20.838 --> 26:22.237
You'll have to forgive him.

26:22.272 --> 26:25.774
He enjoys his anonymity here
perhaps a little too much.

26:25.810 --> 26:27.142
Certainly.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.745
Anyway, I believe it's fate
bringing us all together.

26:29.814 --> 26:32.147
Caitlyn, your
designs are lovely.

26:32.183 --> 26:33.115
Thank you, Doris.

26:33.150 --> 26:34.382
You're welcome, Your Highness.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.218
Oh, uh, or soon-to-be highness?

26:36.286 --> 26:38.821
Lady Isabelle is just fine.

26:40.657 --> 26:42.657
Oh.

26:42.693 --> 26:45.728
Oh, this is it.

26:45.763 --> 26:47.395
Elegant and romantic.

26:47.464 --> 26:48.731
I- I love it.

26:48.766 --> 26:49.765
You really like that one?

26:49.800 --> 26:51.033
I do, I love it.

26:51.068 --> 26:52.667
It'd make me feel
like a princess.

26:52.703 --> 26:54.837
Metaphorically
speaking, of course.

26:54.905 --> 26:57.172
What do you need to have
it done by New Year's Eve?

26:57.208 --> 26:59.742
Doris, would- would you help?

26:59.777 --> 27:00.909
Make a dress for a lady?

27:00.945 --> 27:01.844
Yeah.

27:01.879 --> 27:02.845
Uh, yes.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.213
Great.

27:04.281 --> 27:05.680
Well, then we just need to
talk measurements and fabric.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.449
I believe that's
our cue, Barnaby.

27:07.517 --> 27:09.651
Yes, Your Highness.

27:11.388 --> 27:13.521
Isabelle, I'll see you at lunch.

27:13.557 --> 27:15.323
Alright, darling.

27:16.894 --> 27:18.227
Again, I'm sorry.

27:18.262 --> 27:21.029
You did warn me not
to be embarrassed.

27:24.501 --> 27:25.200
Ok.

27:25.236 --> 27:26.235
Let's get started.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.469
I will go grab the
measuring tape.

27:27.504 --> 27:28.937
Alright.

27:33.610 --> 27:36.044
Well, it's official.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.314
Isabelle's going to
wear Caitlyn's dress.

27:39.383 --> 27:41.483
Mom, it's ok.

27:41.518 --> 27:43.018
No, it is not ok.

27:43.053 --> 27:46.822
This is your opportunity,
not Caitlyn's.

27:46.857 --> 27:48.023
She stole your shot.

27:48.058 --> 27:50.092
She didn't steal anything.

27:50.127 --> 27:53.162
Lady Isabelle liked her dress
and I don't blame her.

27:53.197 --> 27:54.163
It was beautiful.

27:54.198 --> 27:55.664
I am the editor in
chief of one of

27:55.732 --> 27:58.033
the leading fashion
magazines in the world.

27:58.068 --> 28:01.736
I decide what is beautiful
and what isn't.

28:01.772 --> 28:04.506
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it now

28:04.541 --> 28:07.176
because she's already
made up her mind.

28:09.646 --> 28:12.514
Well, maybe we can get
her to change her mind.

28:12.582 --> 28:15.583
Especially if Caitlyn
can't deliver.

28:15.652 --> 28:16.985
I hate it when
your eyes do that.

28:17.021 --> 28:19.855
It usually means you're
plotting something.

28:19.890 --> 28:22.490
You know, it's going
to take a lot of work,

28:22.526 --> 28:24.626
helping the prince and
Lady Isabelle plan

28:24.695 --> 28:25.928
the New Year's Eve party.

28:25.996 --> 28:29.832
Far too much work
for me by myself

28:29.867 --> 28:33.368
but luckily I have an assistant.

28:33.437 --> 28:35.403
But mom, if you load Caitlyn
up with party planning

28:35.439 --> 28:39.507
then she's never gonna be
able to work on the dress.

28:39.543 --> 28:42.544
Oh.

28:51.722 --> 28:57.425
Yes, sure, but... ok, but I...
happy to do it.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.195
Now I have to plan the New
Year's Eve party, too.

29:00.231 --> 29:00.996
What?

29:01.031 --> 29:01.830
Why?

29:01.866 --> 29:03.131
Because Abigail says so.

29:03.167 --> 29:05.033
I'm supposed to meet the
Prince and Lady Isabelle

29:05.069 --> 29:07.369
this afternoon for a
catering audition.

29:07.437 --> 29:09.771
Ok, free food and a
handsome prince?

29:09.840 --> 29:11.473
I'm sorry, what's
the problem again?

29:11.508 --> 29:14.409
He didn't tell me
that he was a prince.

29:14.444 --> 29:16.478
Princes should be required
to identify themselves.

29:16.513 --> 29:19.547
They should have to wear,
like, a name tag or a badge.

29:19.583 --> 29:20.782
He did say he was sorry.

29:20.851 --> 29:22.017
What if I said something
that would have caused

29:22.052 --> 29:23.285
an international incident?

29:23.320 --> 29:25.787
And now I need to work
on the party with him?

29:25.822 --> 29:28.023
How am I supposed to do that and
get the dress ready in time?

29:28.058 --> 29:29.324
We'll figure it out.

29:29.360 --> 29:30.658
This is crazy.

29:30.727 --> 29:33.161
Yesterday I was living a
normal life and now today

29:33.197 --> 29:35.497
I'm somehow mixed
up with royalty?

29:35.532 --> 29:38.100
Well, if it's a choice
between royalty and normal

29:38.168 --> 29:39.801
I'll choose royalty any day.

29:39.836 --> 29:40.802
You don't know that.

29:40.837 --> 29:42.204
Yeah, I do.

29:42.239 --> 29:43.272
Royalty comes with a castle.

29:52.616 --> 29:56.451
I'm officially addicted to this
coffee and it is all your fault.

29:56.486 --> 29:59.221
Thank you, Your Highness.

29:59.256 --> 30:00.389
Jeffery is fine.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.124
Is Lady Isabelle coming?

30:02.159 --> 30:04.492
No, we're dividing
and conquering.

30:04.561 --> 30:09.264
It was this or choosing
centerpieces and I thought food

30:09.300 --> 30:12.100
was much more in my wheel house.

30:16.206 --> 30:17.539
Mmm.

30:17.574 --> 30:19.507
That is wonderful.

30:19.543 --> 30:21.709
You don't get out much, do you?

30:21.745 --> 30:22.844
I told you.

30:22.879 --> 30:24.446
Yes, well you didn't
tell me it was

30:24.481 --> 30:27.215
because you were a prince.

30:27.251 --> 30:30.118
Yes, but remember, you said
you wouldn't be embarrassed.

30:30.154 --> 30:32.154
But I was.

30:32.222 --> 30:33.555
You made me feel like-

30:33.590 --> 30:41.063
Caitlyn, I... I liked being
just Jeff for a little while.

30:41.131 --> 30:43.865
It was nice talking to
someone who treated me

30:43.900 --> 30:47.035
as a person instead
of just a prince.

30:47.104 --> 30:50.072
I didn't mean to hurt
or embarrass you.

30:50.107 --> 30:52.040
I hope you can forgive me.

30:54.878 --> 30:58.947
Well, I presume that
this is all for us.

30:58.983 --> 31:02.150
Yes, well, they gave
us lots of options.

31:02.186 --> 31:04.486
It appears they gave
us all options.

31:04.521 --> 31:06.554
Let's see what we have.

31:06.590 --> 31:09.358
Marrow with framboise glise.

31:09.426 --> 31:10.792
Sounds interesting.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.461
Does it?

31:18.035 --> 31:19.301
Not bad.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.136
No.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.371
Ok.

31:22.406 --> 31:25.640
We'll um... we'll put
that in the maybe column.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.710
So, the next one.

31:28.745 --> 31:32.080
Artisanal seaweed and
oyster croquettes.

31:32.116 --> 31:33.315
Sounds interesting.

31:33.384 --> 31:34.582
Hmm.

31:46.596 --> 31:48.096
An intriguing combination.

31:48.132 --> 31:50.098
Do you eat fancy stuff
like this all the time?

31:50.134 --> 31:52.000
No, no, not always.

31:52.036 --> 31:57.039
Last week we had a simple
duck confit with pine foam.

31:57.074 --> 31:58.006
That's simple?

31:58.042 --> 31:58.673
Yes, why?

31:58.708 --> 31:59.441
What do you eat?

31:59.476 --> 32:00.608
Food.

32:00.644 --> 32:03.578
Like, real food.

32:03.647 --> 32:05.847
You know, the kind of
stuff Jeff would eat.

32:05.916 --> 32:09.584
Yes, well, Jeff is not
throwing a New Year's Eve ball

32:09.619 --> 32:12.487
attended by people who expect
fancy things like this.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.556
Yes, well, you know,

32:14.591 --> 32:20.362
I think deep down everybody just
wants a good juicy hot dog.

32:20.397 --> 32:21.696
Hmm.

32:21.765 --> 32:22.630
Do you know what?

32:22.666 --> 32:23.631
Hmm?

32:23.700 --> 32:25.833
That does sound good.

32:25.869 --> 32:27.635
Mmmhmm.

32:37.514 --> 32:38.447
This is remarkable.

32:38.482 --> 32:39.448
Right?

32:39.483 --> 32:41.450
It's so much better
than pine foam.

32:41.518 --> 32:42.551
Best hot dogs in the city.

32:42.586 --> 32:43.485
Life-changing.

32:45.456 --> 32:47.021
You live in such
a strange world.

32:47.057 --> 32:47.822
I know.

32:47.857 --> 32:49.391
I mean, strange to me.

32:49.460 --> 32:52.227
I just- I could never fit
in with your friends.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.229
Most of them are hangers-on.

32:54.298 --> 32:57.865
They like the idea of being
in proximity to royalty.

32:57.901 --> 32:59.968
So then why invite
them to your party?

33:00.003 --> 33:03.705
The ball is a fundraiser for
the royal family's foundation.

33:03.740 --> 33:06.007
We sponsor scholarships
and after school programs

33:06.042 --> 33:07.509
for at-risk youths.

33:07.578 --> 33:10.912
You'd be shocked at the- at
the statistics of the...

33:13.283 --> 33:14.849
Sorry.

33:14.884 --> 33:19.087
I've been accused of getting
a little carried away

33:19.123 --> 33:21.323
when I'm talking about
the foundation.

33:21.358 --> 33:24.926
I think there's a difference
between carried away and caring.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.495
You're passionate about it.

33:26.530 --> 33:27.962
There's nothing wrong with that.

33:27.998 --> 33:30.064
I love it when I get a chance
to make a real difference

33:30.100 --> 33:32.033
in people's lives.

33:32.068 --> 33:34.469
So these hangers-on, they
just write big cheques

33:34.505 --> 33:35.837
to come to your party?

33:35.872 --> 33:38.706
Well, no, we auction
off pieces of artwork

33:38.742 --> 33:40.308
from the royal collection.

33:40.344 --> 33:42.043
They should be
arriving tomorrow.

33:42.078 --> 33:42.944
Really?

33:43.013 --> 33:44.012
Yes.

33:44.047 --> 33:46.515
I used to be an art teacher.

33:46.583 --> 33:48.916
Art teacher to dress designer.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.718
I bet that's an
interesting story.

33:50.787 --> 33:52.254
Why don't you come by
the mansion tomorrow

33:52.289 --> 33:54.122
and tell me all about it?

33:54.158 --> 33:55.557
If a prince is asking me

33:55.626 --> 33:59.761
to do something am I
allowed to say no?

33:59.829 --> 34:01.196
Absolutely.

34:01.231 --> 34:02.997
Of course I could have you
thrown into a dungeon for it

34:03.066 --> 34:06.301
but you could say no.

34:10.706 --> 34:12.373
I should um... I should
probably get going.

34:12.409 --> 34:13.940
You know, we only have four
days to get the dress ready

34:13.976 --> 34:15.310
for Lady Isabelle.

34:15.379 --> 34:16.277
Right.

34:16.346 --> 34:17.745
We wouldn't want
to disappoint her.

34:17.813 --> 34:18.913
No.

34:28.692 --> 34:29.190
Hey.

34:29.226 --> 34:29.924
Hey.

34:29.958 --> 34:31.726
How was it?

34:31.761 --> 34:35.263
It was... not terrible.

34:35.299 --> 34:37.065
That's good, right?

34:37.100 --> 34:39.534
Yeah.

34:39.570 --> 34:42.469
Yeah, it is.

34:42.505 --> 34:43.771
What can I do?

34:43.840 --> 34:45.172
Make some coffee.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.842
It's gonna be a long night.

35:01.935 --> 35:02.500
Good morning.

35:02.536 --> 35:03.200
I'm up. I'm good.

35:03.236 --> 35:04.068
I'm doing it.

35:04.103 --> 35:04.702
No, no, no, no, no.

35:04.771 --> 35:05.303
Stop. Stop.

35:05.338 --> 35:06.170
Ooh.

35:06.205 --> 35:06.905
Yeah, you're doing this wrong.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.473
No.

35:08.508 --> 35:09.407
No, I'm so sorry.

35:09.443 --> 35:10.508
No, it's ok, it's ok.

35:10.577 --> 35:12.877
It's an easy fix.

35:12.913 --> 35:14.011
Were you up all night?

35:14.047 --> 35:14.779
No.

35:14.815 --> 35:16.414
Maybe.

35:16.450 --> 35:17.449
What's the date?

35:17.484 --> 35:19.551
The 28th.

35:19.586 --> 35:21.619
It's three days until the ball.

35:21.655 --> 35:25.222
Actually, that's only, like,
two days until the fitting.

35:25.258 --> 35:27.024
There's so much to
do for the party.

35:27.093 --> 35:28.259
There's so much to do.

35:28.294 --> 35:33.598
Abigail, she... she keeps
going, keep requests,

35:33.633 --> 35:35.533
like how is it
supposed to happen?

35:35.569 --> 35:38.736
Oh, ok, Caitlyn, just relax.

35:38.772 --> 35:39.604
Ok?

35:39.639 --> 35:40.705
I'll call in sick to work today.

35:40.740 --> 35:41.773
It'll be fine.

35:41.808 --> 35:43.307
No, I cannot ask you to do that.

35:43.343 --> 35:44.742
It's ok, I want to.

35:44.778 --> 35:47.078
Unless, of course, you
wanna trade places

35:47.113 --> 35:49.213
and I'll go look at
fabulous works of art

35:49.282 --> 35:50.482
with the handsome prince.

35:50.550 --> 35:52.383
It's not like that, we're
just planning a party.

35:52.418 --> 35:53.651
I don't care what it's like.

35:53.687 --> 35:56.821
In my head this is the
perfect princess fantasy.

35:56.857 --> 35:59.491
Only it's you instead of me,

35:59.526 --> 36:02.159
but I'm good with
living vicariously.

36:02.195 --> 36:05.196
Ok, please Doris, between
the dress and the party

36:05.231 --> 36:08.700
and the whole prince thing,
it's stressful enough.

36:08.735 --> 36:11.168
Let's not make this something
that it doesn't need to be.

36:11.204 --> 36:11.870
Alright.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.140
Abigail.

36:18.311 --> 36:20.745
Hello, Abigail.

36:20.814 --> 36:22.179
I know.

36:22.215 --> 36:23.347
Yep, I know.

36:23.416 --> 36:23.815
I know.

36:23.884 --> 36:24.616
Ok.

36:24.651 --> 36:26.150
I- I'll be right there.

36:27.954 --> 36:28.953
Go.

36:28.989 --> 36:30.755
I got this.

36:30.790 --> 36:32.690
Ok, I'm going.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.862
You know you're not
actually moving, right?

36:37.898 --> 36:38.530
Mmmhmm.

36:38.565 --> 36:39.931
Yep.

36:47.741 --> 36:48.506
You're late.

36:48.542 --> 36:49.841
I know, I'm sorry.

36:49.876 --> 36:50.975
Oh, that's alright, they
have just started to unpack

36:51.011 --> 36:52.043
the artwork so...

36:52.078 --> 36:53.344
Good.

36:53.379 --> 36:54.646
Caitlyn, I'm not giving
you too much work, am I?

36:54.681 --> 36:55.212
No.

36:55.281 --> 36:56.180
No, not at all.

36:56.249 --> 36:57.749
Everything should
be done in time.

36:57.784 --> 36:59.083
Should be?

36:59.118 --> 37:01.385
Isabelle, perhaps we should
talk about an alternative

37:01.454 --> 37:02.186
for your dress-

37:02.255 --> 37:03.320
It will be done.

37:03.389 --> 37:04.822
Everything will be done in time.

37:04.858 --> 37:06.123
Well what about the party?

37:06.159 --> 37:07.425
You're not going to drop
the ball on that, are you?

37:07.460 --> 37:08.392
No.

37:08.428 --> 37:10.361
The music, the
food, the flowers?

37:10.396 --> 37:12.430
And we're reviewing the
artwork this morning.

37:12.465 --> 37:14.165
I think Caitlyn has
everything well in hand.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.667
I'm sure she does.

37:15.702 --> 37:18.036
Well, Abigail and I are off
to find fabulous things to go

37:18.104 --> 37:19.971
with my fabulous
dress and afterwards

37:20.040 --> 37:22.406
perhaps we can go over seating
charts for the party.

37:22.475 --> 37:23.207
Sounds great.

37:23.276 --> 37:25.242
Wonderful.

37:25.278 --> 37:26.911
Goodbye.

37:31.751 --> 37:33.184
Shall we?

37:33.219 --> 37:35.086
Well, we have a little time
before they're ready for us

37:35.121 --> 37:39.190
to look at anything, so...
coffee?

37:39.225 --> 37:41.158
I have so much to
do before the ball.

37:41.194 --> 37:42.927
I- I don't know if I
have time for coffee.

37:42.963 --> 37:47.832
Well, lucky for us the person
throwing the ball does.

37:47.867 --> 37:51.535
Don't make me threaten you
with the dungeon again.

37:51.605 --> 37:52.436
Coffee it is.

37:54.240 --> 37:55.873
Ok.

38:03.750 --> 38:06.017
Caitlyn, you really
should relax.

38:06.052 --> 38:08.686
It's going to work
out just fine.

38:08.755 --> 38:09.621
Yeah.

38:09.656 --> 38:10.888
I hope so.

38:10.924 --> 38:13.157
You sound unsure.

38:13.192 --> 38:15.259
I've never made a dress for
a real live human being

38:15.294 --> 38:16.761
other than myself.

38:16.796 --> 38:20.264
Well, I have the utmost
confidence in you.

38:20.299 --> 38:23.534
It just- it... has to
be special, you know?

38:23.569 --> 38:26.938
I mean, especially if you're gonna...
you know.

38:26.973 --> 38:28.973
Ask Isabelle to marry me.

38:29.009 --> 38:30.441
Yes.

38:30.476 --> 38:33.745
The fashion show the other
night, that looked spectacular.

38:33.780 --> 38:37.615
Oh, yes, well Abigail does
nothing less than spectacular.

38:37.651 --> 38:41.853
It must be really challenging
working for someone so...

38:41.921 --> 38:43.254
exacting.

38:43.289 --> 38:44.622
Exacting.

38:44.691 --> 38:49.527
That is a word I will
have to remember.

38:49.562 --> 38:51.495
It's not always a
barrel of laughs

38:51.531 --> 38:54.331
but I have learned so much.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.801
It's basically been like a
crash course in fashion.

38:56.836 --> 39:02.140
You know, sometimes I feel like
the crash test dummy, though.

39:02.175 --> 39:04.809
If it's any consolation I feel
like that most days myself.

39:04.844 --> 39:06.377
Hmm.

39:06.412 --> 39:08.412
Is this that point in the
conversation where the rich,

39:08.481 --> 39:10.414
handsome prince with the
beautiful girlfriend

39:10.449 --> 39:12.249
is going to tell me
how hard his life is?

39:12.285 --> 39:13.517
No.

39:13.553 --> 39:14.886
No, no, no.

39:14.954 --> 39:17.588
My position affords me great
luxury and great reward.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.323
And I'm not just talking
about the palaces.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.391
Oh, palaces.

39:20.459 --> 39:21.659
More than- more than one?

39:21.728 --> 39:23.594
Yes.

39:23.629 --> 39:26.998
I can't even keep track.

39:27.067 --> 39:31.135
But seriously, it
is an honour to be

39:31.171 --> 39:32.636
a member of the royal family.

39:32.672 --> 39:34.572
The people of our country
are hard-working,

39:34.607 --> 39:36.174
decent and generous.

39:36.209 --> 39:39.077
I hear a "but" coming.

39:39.112 --> 39:43.347
But a lot of things
are decided for you.

39:43.416 --> 39:45.083
Like what?

39:45.118 --> 39:49.020
Like who your friends are,
where you can go to school,

39:49.089 --> 39:50.487
and who you shall marry.

39:50.556 --> 39:51.889
Excuse me, Your Highness.

39:51.925 --> 39:54.192
There's a call from your father.

39:54.260 --> 39:56.393
Take a message.

39:56.429 --> 39:58.162
You want me to take a
message from the king?

39:58.198 --> 40:00.497
Yes, I do.

40:02.836 --> 40:05.369
May I take a message,
Your Majesty?

40:17.283 --> 40:18.449
I like this for you.

40:18.484 --> 40:20.684
Oh, that is quite pretty.

40:20.720 --> 40:24.288
I love when designers
give me things to wear.

40:25.725 --> 40:28.793
What do you think about this?

40:28.828 --> 40:29.894
Mmm...

40:29.929 --> 40:30.895
Message received.

40:30.930 --> 40:32.329
Thank you.

40:32.365 --> 40:35.032
I just wanna give you
everything you want,

40:35.068 --> 40:37.668
whether it's the
party or the dress.

40:37.703 --> 40:39.270
You seem concerned.

40:39.305 --> 40:41.906
Well, Caitlyn's never done
anything like this before

40:41.941 --> 40:45.977
and it might be a good idea to
have a little back-up plan.

40:46.045 --> 40:47.578
You know, just in case.

40:47.613 --> 40:48.512
Oh.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.447
Well, what did you have in mind?

40:50.483 --> 40:53.484
Oh, well, um... this is
just off the top of my head

40:53.519 --> 40:57.155
but many of the dresses in the
fashion show are available.

40:57.223 --> 40:58.589
Maybe you could look
at a few of those

40:58.658 --> 41:00.191
and see if anything might do.

41:00.226 --> 41:04.528
I mean, just in case something
happens with Caitlyn's dress.

41:04.563 --> 41:08.132
Well, I suppose that
isn't a bad idea.

41:08.168 --> 41:10.101
Having a back-up
plan couldn't hurt.

41:10.170 --> 41:11.335
Exactly.

41:11.370 --> 41:13.504
But I'm sure that Caitlyn
will come through.

41:13.572 --> 41:14.839
It would take something
quite big for me

41:14.874 --> 41:17.374
to change my mind
about that dress.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.017
So wait.

41:26.052 --> 41:30.054
The first thing you ever
designed was a princess costume?

41:30.089 --> 41:31.722
It was for the school play.

41:31.757 --> 41:33.490
My mother, bless her
heart, she tried so hard,

41:33.526 --> 41:36.393
but I took one look at it and
went "no, please, let me".

41:36.429 --> 41:37.661
How old were you?

41:37.697 --> 41:38.963
Uh, six.

41:38.998 --> 41:40.464
Brilliant.

41:40.499 --> 41:42.666
So that made you want
to become a designer?

41:42.702 --> 41:44.802
Well, it primarily made me
wanna become a princess,

41:44.838 --> 41:46.503
but yeah.

41:46.572 --> 41:48.339
I never thought of it that way.

41:48.374 --> 41:50.942
To me it's always
been just clothes.

41:50.977 --> 41:51.775
Oh, no.

41:51.811 --> 41:53.211
It's so much more than that.

41:53.246 --> 41:55.379
Fashion is about expressing
ourselves from the inside

41:55.414 --> 41:57.081
by what we wear on the outside.

41:57.116 --> 42:00.551
So if fashion was your calling,

42:00.586 --> 42:02.519
why the detour
into teaching art?

42:02.588 --> 42:06.324
I was young and felt like
I needed a back-up plan.

42:06.359 --> 42:09.894
Before I knew it that back-up
plan had taken over.

42:09.929 --> 42:13.264
So then one day you just decided
to change your whole life?

42:13.299 --> 42:14.631
Yeah.

42:14.667 --> 42:18.035
Believe it or not it was part
of a New Year's resolution.

42:18.071 --> 42:18.936
Really?

42:18.972 --> 42:19.636
Mmmhmm.

42:19.672 --> 42:20.404
You're kidding.

42:20.439 --> 42:21.438
No.

42:21.474 --> 42:24.041
It was kind of one
of those things.

42:24.110 --> 42:25.676
I had broken up with someone

42:25.745 --> 42:27.111
that I had been
seeing for a while.

42:27.180 --> 42:31.249
Nothing dramatic, we just...
we wanted different things.

42:31.284 --> 42:33.584
And that started making me
think about the other things

42:33.652 --> 42:35.953
that I wanted in my life.

42:35.989 --> 42:39.423
It was kind of time
for a fresh start.

42:39.492 --> 42:44.495
I find that quite remarkable.

42:44.530 --> 42:45.863
Thank you.

42:45.899 --> 42:48.532
But of course you did also
say that about the hot dog.

42:48.567 --> 42:51.068
Pales in comparison.

42:51.137 --> 42:53.104
Oh, wow.

42:53.139 --> 42:55.273
I love this one.

42:55.341 --> 42:57.041
<i>It is lovely.</i>

42:57.076 --> 42:59.743
Here's this sort
of average woman

42:59.779 --> 43:01.345
and she's wearing
this stunning gown.

43:01.381 --> 43:04.148
Look at the way she's
holding her face.

43:04.183 --> 43:06.550
Like she can't believe
how beautiful she looks.

43:06.585 --> 43:09.453
<i>This is how the dress
made her feel.</i>

43:09.488 --> 43:12.056
This is what fashion can do.

43:12.091 --> 43:15.026
That's her fresh start.

43:23.173 --> 43:24.840
I think we should
go with this china.

43:24.875 --> 43:26.074
Ok.

43:28.112 --> 43:30.211
I'm not convinced about
the flatware though.

43:30.280 --> 43:32.313
Oh, I can have them bring in
others and you can see it.

43:32.349 --> 43:34.549
Yes, let's do that.

43:34.584 --> 43:35.250
Great.

43:35.318 --> 43:36.484
Any update on the dress?

43:36.520 --> 43:37.653
It will be ready for
your fitting tomorrow.

43:37.688 --> 43:38.754
Wonderful.

43:38.789 --> 43:39.921
And the art auction?

43:39.957 --> 43:41.123
It's all set.

43:41.158 --> 43:43.391
The pieces are beautiful.

43:43.426 --> 43:45.193
I can't believe they're
willing to give them up.

43:45.228 --> 43:47.996
Part of being royalty
is making tough choices

43:48.032 --> 43:50.465
for the greater good.

43:50.534 --> 43:52.034
Certainly gives me an
insight into the world

43:52.069 --> 43:53.702
that most aren't
able to appreciate.

43:53.771 --> 43:55.937
The extent of royalty and
nobility in my family ends

43:55.973 --> 43:57.973
with my uncle Duke.

43:59.910 --> 44:01.476
Yes.

44:01.511 --> 44:05.446
Being Lady Isabelle is much more
than just a title I inherited

44:05.482 --> 44:09.151
and should I one day be asked
to join the royal family

44:09.186 --> 44:11.452
I'll consider it a great honour.

44:11.488 --> 44:14.222
It's much more than just a
childhood fairytale about

44:14.257 --> 44:16.291
becoming a princess.

44:16.326 --> 44:18.526
I think you'll make
a great princess.

44:18.562 --> 44:19.895
Oh, thank you.

44:19.963 --> 44:21.596
I do, too.

44:22.766 --> 44:28.136
Now, if we could just convince
Jeffery to embrace that.

44:28.172 --> 44:29.705
I'm sure he will.

44:29.740 --> 44:31.339
Yes.

44:31.374 --> 44:33.308
He just needs to focus.

44:34.845 --> 44:36.978
Distractions are such
a terrible thing.

44:37.014 --> 44:38.680
Don't you think?

44:46.924 --> 44:49.091
I thought for sure Caitlyn
would crack under the pressure

44:49.126 --> 44:51.593
and then I could swoop
in and save the day.

44:51.628 --> 44:53.962
Mom, just leave it alone.

44:53.997 --> 44:55.163
I can't find one of my dresses

44:55.199 --> 44:56.631
that Isabelle would
want, anyway.

44:56.700 --> 44:57.866
Well, keep looking.

44:57.901 --> 44:59.334
We have to find something
that's ready to go

44:59.369 --> 45:01.737
before everything
comes crashing down.

45:01.772 --> 45:03.205
Why would it crash down?

45:03.240 --> 45:06.274
Because we're going to
give it a little push.

45:06.309 --> 45:08.910
Mom, why is this so
important to you?

45:08.946 --> 45:11.346
Leighton, why isn't this
more important to you?

45:11.381 --> 45:15.083
Because I want to succeed
or fail on my own merits,

45:15.152 --> 45:17.585
not because my mother is
playing puppet master.

45:17.621 --> 45:20.088
My darling, this is a
cut-throat business.

45:20.124 --> 45:22.958
I am just trying to
provide a few advantages.

45:22.993 --> 45:25.127
And I appreciate that.

45:25.195 --> 45:29.064
But just don't do
anything too crazy.

45:29.099 --> 45:31.599
I will be the very
picture of restraint.

45:31.668 --> 45:33.268
Just a little...

45:33.303 --> 45:34.736
push.

45:34.772 --> 45:38.406
Oh, let me see.

45:38.441 --> 45:41.276
This could work.

45:42.512 --> 45:43.812
Ok, I've got a couple hours

45:43.847 --> 45:46.581
until I need to get
back to the mansion.

45:46.616 --> 45:48.049
What can I do?

45:48.085 --> 45:49.184
Go take a nap.

45:49.219 --> 45:50.252
You must be exhausted.

45:50.287 --> 45:51.586
It's two days until the ball.

45:51.621 --> 45:53.488
I can sleep next year.

45:53.523 --> 45:54.489
Ok.

45:54.524 --> 45:55.991
Grab some beads.

45:56.026 --> 45:57.325
Ok.

45:57.394 --> 45:59.094
Oh, wow.

45:59.163 --> 46:01.096
This is beautiful.

46:01.131 --> 46:03.131
It's a beautiful design.

46:03.167 --> 46:06.134
You know, you and Lady
Isabelle are almost exactly

46:06.170 --> 46:07.936
the same measurements.

46:07.971 --> 46:10.438
You should ask for it back after
the ball and you can wear it.

46:10.507 --> 46:12.540
Where would I wear
a dress like this?

46:12.609 --> 46:13.942
Yoga?

46:13.977 --> 46:18.013
This would be a
great yoga dress.

46:18.048 --> 46:21.582
No, this dress is definitely
made for a princess.

46:26.990 --> 46:29.024
Hello, Abigail.

46:29.059 --> 46:34.696
Yes, but I'm supposed
to- Right, but... now?

46:34.764 --> 46:36.164
Ok.

46:36.233 --> 46:38.333
I'll be right there.

46:39.369 --> 46:41.169
Now there's an emergency at the
office with the next issue.

46:41.238 --> 46:42.270
I have to go in.

46:42.306 --> 46:43.604
What?

46:43.673 --> 46:45.506
You know she's trying to
overwhelm you, right?

46:45.542 --> 46:47.375
Yeah.

46:50.580 --> 46:52.347
Now what?

46:56.353 --> 46:57.319
Jeffery.

46:57.354 --> 46:58.553
Wh- what're you doing here?

46:58.588 --> 47:01.022
I'm on the way to review
the auction brochures.

47:01.058 --> 47:02.991
Abigail suggested
you should join me.

47:03.026 --> 47:05.861
Unless you are
sick of me by now.

47:05.896 --> 47:07.028
No.

47:07.064 --> 47:10.365
I couldn't get sick of you.

47:10.400 --> 47:11.532
But I can't.

47:11.568 --> 47:13.034
Abigail is making
me go into work.

47:13.070 --> 47:14.502
She said she wanted
you to sign off

47:14.571 --> 47:17.672
on the brochures personally.

47:17.707 --> 47:19.774
Ok.

47:19.809 --> 47:21.943
Would you be able to bring them
by the office for me to review?

47:22.012 --> 47:23.211
I would.

47:23.247 --> 47:24.145
Ok, great.

47:24.181 --> 47:25.280
Doris, do you need anything?

47:25.315 --> 47:27.349
If I do I can handle it.

47:28.886 --> 47:30.185
Would it help if Barnaby stayed
here in case a need arises?

47:30.220 --> 47:33.855
That would be amazing,
if Barnaby doesn't mind.

47:33.891 --> 47:36.258
If that's what you
want, Your Highness.

47:36.293 --> 47:38.226
The driver can take you
wherever you need to go.

47:38.262 --> 47:43.865
Or, if all else fails, I'm an
old pro at the subway now.

47:43.901 --> 47:45.500
Well, thank you again, Barnaby.

47:45.535 --> 47:47.735
And Doris, if you need
anything please call.

47:47.771 --> 47:49.470
Ok.

47:58.115 --> 48:01.249
Well, that was interesting.

48:01.285 --> 48:03.184
Quite.

48:10.294 --> 48:13.328
Ok, so do you see
any other problems?

48:13.363 --> 48:14.296
No.

48:14.331 --> 48:15.430
Excellent work.

48:15.465 --> 48:17.799
I never would have seen
half those errors.

48:17.867 --> 48:18.766
I work at a magazine.

48:18.835 --> 48:20.668
It's my job.

48:20.703 --> 48:22.203
Well, thank you.

48:22.239 --> 48:25.506
You have gone above and
beyond on everything.

48:25.542 --> 48:26.541
Oh, no. Thank you.

48:26.576 --> 48:28.376
You've been so kind
and supportive.

48:31.048 --> 48:33.214
You and Isabelle, of course.

48:34.851 --> 48:36.084
You know, I never...

48:36.153 --> 48:38.619
I never really did hear
how the two of you met.

48:38.655 --> 48:42.023
We were introduced
at a ceremony.

48:42.059 --> 48:45.060
I can't remember what for.

48:45.095 --> 48:47.128
Monarchies love
their ceremonies.

48:47.164 --> 48:48.296
Oh, yes.

48:48.332 --> 48:49.331
Well, they have to use
all those scepters.

48:49.399 --> 48:53.468
Yes.

48:53.503 --> 48:56.704
Anyway, she'd heard that
one of our board members

48:56.739 --> 48:58.706
was planning on stepping
down and was interested

48:58.741 --> 49:01.609
in taking over his place.

49:01.644 --> 49:03.244
Well, that sounds really nice.

49:03.313 --> 49:07.782
Isabelle is a lovely young woman
and I care for her deeply.

49:07.851 --> 49:10.685
I feel like there's
a "but" coming.

49:10.753 --> 49:14.922
My father has decided it's
time for him to step down

49:14.958 --> 49:19.560
and for me to take
over the throne.

49:19.596 --> 49:25.033
However, he insists
that I marry first.

49:25.068 --> 49:27.469
What do you want?

49:30.707 --> 49:32.374
Shall I escort you home now?

49:32.442 --> 49:33.208
Oh, no.

49:33.276 --> 49:35.043
You don't have to do that.

49:35.078 --> 49:36.244
It's no bother.

49:36.279 --> 49:38.846
I need to retrieve
Barnaby, anyway.

49:38.915 --> 49:40.148
Right.

49:40.217 --> 49:44.252
Um, well, in that
case, thank you.

49:55.865 --> 49:58.400
You know, you can sit down
if you want, Barnaby.

49:58.435 --> 49:59.200
Thank you, miss.

49:59.236 --> 50:00.335
I'm fine.

50:00.370 --> 50:01.503
How do you do that?

50:01.571 --> 50:02.637
Do what, miss?

50:02.705 --> 50:04.439
Just stand there.

50:04.508 --> 50:06.641
Quietly, not moving.

50:06.676 --> 50:09.277
I've had a lot of
practice, miss.

50:09.346 --> 50:11.012
How long have you
worked for the prince?

50:11.048 --> 50:13.781
I joined the employ of the royal
family when Prince Jeffery

50:13.816 --> 50:15.650
was ten years old.

50:15.685 --> 50:19.087
Wow, that's a long time.

50:19.122 --> 50:20.688
You must know him pretty well.

50:20.723 --> 50:22.924
I'd say so, yes.

50:22.959 --> 50:24.625
He seems like a good guy.

50:24.661 --> 50:27.095
Yes, he is.

50:27.164 --> 50:30.631
And Miss Caitlyn seems
quite lovely, as well.

50:30.700 --> 50:32.434
She is.

50:32.502 --> 50:34.035
She's the best.

50:35.772 --> 50:36.837
Shall I?

50:36.873 --> 50:37.605
Uh, sure.

50:37.674 --> 50:39.040
Go for it.

50:44.347 --> 50:45.046
Barnaby.

50:45.115 --> 50:46.781
Hello, Ms. Miller.

50:46.816 --> 50:47.582
Abigail.

50:47.617 --> 50:48.916
Hello, Doris.

50:48.985 --> 50:50.452
I came to talk to Caitlyn
about the party planning.

50:50.487 --> 50:51.819
Well, I thought she was
at the office with you.

50:54.023 --> 50:55.656
Is this Isabelle's dress?

50:55.692 --> 50:58.393
Yeah, it's not done
yet but that's...

50:58.428 --> 51:00.195
She's going to love it.

51:03.967 --> 51:06.634
Is that the prince I see?

51:06.669 --> 51:08.136
Where?

51:08.171 --> 51:08.769
Right there.

51:08.805 --> 51:10.371
To the right.

51:10.407 --> 51:12.073
<i>I don't see him.</i>

51:12.142 --> 51:13.308
I'm sure it's him.

51:13.343 --> 51:14.875
Over to the right.

51:14.911 --> 51:18.513
I don't think so.

51:18.548 --> 51:22.217
Well, maybe I was mistaken.

51:22.252 --> 51:26.154
Would you just tell Caitlyn that
I will speak to her tomorrow?

51:32.620 --> 51:34.400
It's only a couple days
until the new year.

51:34.501 --> 51:36.601
Do you have any resolutions?

51:36.670 --> 51:40.438
I want to make sure that the
foundation is in good shape.

51:40.473 --> 51:44.309
Of course there will
be a wedding to plan.

51:44.344 --> 51:45.577
Right.

51:45.612 --> 51:46.311
What about you?

51:46.379 --> 51:47.845
What are your resolutions?

51:47.880 --> 51:49.214
Oh, I have a few.

51:49.282 --> 51:51.382
A million.

51:51.418 --> 51:53.184
How about top three?

51:53.220 --> 51:55.119
Ok.

51:55.154 --> 51:57.955
I want to take more chances.

51:58.024 --> 52:00.658
Because quitting your art
teacher job to pursue

52:00.694 --> 52:03.628
a dream career was
playing it safe?

52:03.697 --> 52:05.396
That's the thing.

52:05.465 --> 52:07.332
You know, I did that and
then I started another job

52:07.367 --> 52:10.401
that wasn't actually
what I wanted.

52:10.437 --> 52:15.740
I didn't really start
taking chances until...

52:15.775 --> 52:18.509
Until when?

52:18.578 --> 52:21.178
Until you and
Isabelle came along.

52:21.214 --> 52:23.581
You know, now my design is
gonna be worn by nobility

52:23.617 --> 52:27.418
and featured on the
cover of a magazine.

52:27.487 --> 52:29.254
What are your other resolutions?

52:29.289 --> 52:30.321
The usual.

52:30.390 --> 52:34.759
Friendship, love, silly stuff.

52:34.794 --> 52:36.927
Love is not silly.

52:36.963 --> 52:39.397
Not if you're doing it
correctly, at least.

52:39.466 --> 52:44.135
It should be exciting
and unexpected.

52:44.170 --> 52:47.538
It should come out of nowhere.

52:47.574 --> 52:51.942
I hope that'll happen
to me some day.

52:51.978 --> 52:54.211
I hope so, too.

53:04.524 --> 53:05.456
Mom, I got your message.

53:05.492 --> 53:06.357
What's going on?

53:06.393 --> 53:07.925
Come look.

53:10.463 --> 53:12.664
What... is that Caitlyn's dress?

53:12.699 --> 53:13.964
The one and only.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.700
Until now.

53:17.470 --> 53:19.437
What're you talking about?

53:19.472 --> 53:21.472
What is the biggest sin in
the world of exclusive,

53:21.541 --> 53:23.941
one-of-a-kind fashions?

53:23.976 --> 53:26.210
That they're not one-of-a-kind.

53:26.245 --> 53:28.212
Exactly.

53:28.247 --> 53:29.447
So, what?

53:29.482 --> 53:30.782
You're gonna have someone
make a duplicate?

53:30.817 --> 53:32.283
How are you gonna do
that in two days?

53:32.319 --> 53:33.718
We don't have to.

53:33.753 --> 53:36.421
We just have to make people
think there's another dress.

53:36.456 --> 53:38.423
I have someone in the art
department working on it

53:38.458 --> 53:41.426
and when they're done nobody's
gonna know it isn't real.

53:41.461 --> 53:43.795
Ok, I still don't understand.

53:43.863 --> 53:46.531
Then we'll have someone
publish the photo

53:46.599 --> 53:49.233
and it won't be
one-of-a-kind anymore.

53:49.268 --> 53:51.703
And Isabelle won't want it,

53:51.738 --> 53:54.238
and we'll have a
Leighton Miller original

53:54.273 --> 53:55.773
ready to take its place.

53:55.842 --> 53:58.776
Mom, do you remember when I said
don't do anything too crazy?

53:58.812 --> 54:02.980
Leighton, I am just trying to
help you launch your career.

54:03.015 --> 54:07.852
Mom, this is not the way I
wanna become successful.

54:07.887 --> 54:10.455
I could never live with myself.

54:13.259 --> 54:16.394
Ok.

54:16.429 --> 54:18.028
You promise?

54:18.064 --> 54:22.633
No more cartoon villain plots?

54:22.702 --> 54:24.702
I promise.

54:43.757 --> 54:48.158
Um, well... have a good evening.

54:48.194 --> 54:49.794
Thank you.

54:49.829 --> 54:51.696
You too.

54:55.268 --> 54:57.869
Barnaby. Shall we?

55:09.015 --> 55:10.581
Ok.

55:10.617 --> 55:13.217
Let's get to work.

55:14.821 --> 55:16.086
What was that?

55:16.122 --> 55:17.488
What was what?

55:17.557 --> 55:21.358
The whole "have a good
evening" and "you too"

55:21.428 --> 55:23.795
and let's both stare at the
floor uncomfortably thing

55:23.863 --> 55:25.062
that just happened.

55:25.097 --> 55:26.497
That didn't happen.

55:26.533 --> 55:27.665
Uh, yeah.

55:27.700 --> 55:29.634
It really did.

55:29.702 --> 55:33.170
Ok, well maybe spending
so much time with him

55:33.239 --> 55:36.808
has made it easy to forget
that he might be proposing

55:36.843 --> 55:40.077
to another woman in 48 hours.

55:40.112 --> 55:41.512
You're falling in love with him.

55:41.548 --> 55:43.180
No I'm not.

55:43.215 --> 55:44.515
I'm just-

55:44.584 --> 55:46.016
Caitlyn, I saw how you were
looking at him earlier.

55:46.052 --> 55:48.285
See, that's the thing.

55:48.321 --> 55:48.986
I can't do that.

55:49.021 --> 55:50.254
It's not right.

55:50.289 --> 55:53.257
He was looking at
you the same way.

55:53.326 --> 55:54.459
Don't say that.

55:54.494 --> 55:55.326
Why not?

55:55.361 --> 55:57.562
Because he's dating Isabelle.

55:57.597 --> 55:59.864
And he may be asking
her to marry him.

55:59.899 --> 56:02.132
But what if he doesn't?

56:02.168 --> 56:03.734
Doris, he's a prince.

56:03.770 --> 56:04.702
He's gonna be king.

56:04.737 --> 56:06.637
I don't fit in that world.

56:06.673 --> 56:09.073
It's a fairy tale and
fairytales don't exist.

56:09.108 --> 56:12.109
Ok, so you're not falling
in love with him,

56:12.144 --> 56:14.512
but do you like him?

56:14.547 --> 56:16.547
It doesn't matter.

56:16.616 --> 56:18.549
Because it's not gonna be me
that he's kissing at midnight

56:18.585 --> 56:20.818
on New Year's Eve.

56:35.802 --> 56:37.535
Is there anything
I can do to help

56:37.570 --> 56:40.137
with whatever may be troubling
you, Your Highness?

56:40.172 --> 56:43.841
What makes you think something's
troubling me, Barnaby?

56:43.877 --> 56:46.443
Because I've known you
since you were a child.

56:46.479 --> 56:49.146
If I may say so, Your Highness,
you've never been very good

56:49.181 --> 56:50.915
at disguising your feelings.

56:50.950 --> 56:53.684
Something that's landed
me in a spot of trouble

56:53.720 --> 56:55.352
more than a few times.

56:55.388 --> 56:57.121
Do you remember
when you were 16,

56:57.156 --> 57:00.024
the incident with the car?

57:00.059 --> 57:02.560
The one I took without
permission and proceeded

57:02.595 --> 57:05.095
to knock down an 18th
century statue with?

57:05.164 --> 57:07.164
That would be the one.

57:07.199 --> 57:10.668
I have a vague
recollection, yes.

57:10.703 --> 57:13.203
What I remember is the look
on your face the next time

57:13.272 --> 57:14.805
you were driven somewhere.

57:14.874 --> 57:16.574
Even though you were traveling
in a way that a person

57:16.643 --> 57:19.510
of your station is expected to,

57:19.579 --> 57:21.445
it's not what you wanted.

57:21.514 --> 57:23.648
You wanted to do it your way.

57:23.683 --> 57:26.450
Yes, that's true.

57:26.519 --> 57:28.218
But look how that turned out.

57:28.254 --> 57:30.555
Maybe it was worth the risk.

57:30.590 --> 57:34.491
The statue of my great
great-grandfather

57:34.527 --> 57:36.226
would likely disagree.

57:36.262 --> 57:36.994
If Caitlyn is-

57:37.030 --> 57:38.763
She is.

57:38.831 --> 57:42.366
But when I took that
car for a drive

57:42.401 --> 57:45.803
somebody could have
gotten really hurt.

57:45.838 --> 57:48.305
It's not worth the risk.

58:09.361 --> 58:10.227
Hello.

58:10.262 --> 58:12.196
This is Lady Isabelle Collins.

58:12.231 --> 58:16.133
I'd like to speak with
King Richard, please.

58:16.202 --> 58:17.902
Thank you.

58:49.075 --> 58:50.041
It's perfect.

58:50.076 --> 58:52.009
Isabelle, you look radiant.

58:52.078 --> 58:53.611
I do, don't I?

58:53.680 --> 58:55.880
Brava, Lady Isabelle.

58:55.949 --> 58:57.181
Thank you, Barnaby.

58:57.249 --> 58:59.283
But the real cheers
go to Caitlyn.

58:59.351 --> 59:01.118
Oh, I couldn't have
done it without Doris.

59:01.153 --> 59:02.119
Oh.

59:02.154 --> 59:02.920
Well, you both
deserve the credit.

59:02.956 --> 59:04.221
I couldn't be happier.

59:04.256 --> 59:05.890
We still have a few
small tweaks to make.

59:05.925 --> 59:07.191
Um, let me mark.

59:07.226 --> 59:08.759
They'll be done in time
for the party tomorrow?

59:08.795 --> 59:10.194
Oh yeah, this is easy stuff.

59:10.229 --> 59:11.328
We'll do this, we'll
have it cleaned

59:11.363 --> 59:12.563
and we'll deliver
it in the morning.

59:12.632 --> 59:14.665
Wonderful.

59:14.734 --> 59:17.802
This is the start of big
things for you, I predict.

59:20.607 --> 59:23.040
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

59:41.594 --> 59:42.927
Caitlyn?

59:46.432 --> 59:47.331
Are you ok?

59:47.399 --> 59:48.365
I'm fine.

59:48.400 --> 59:50.334
I'm sorry, I just
got a little...

59:50.369 --> 59:52.503
dreams don't come
true very often,

59:52.538 --> 59:55.239
so it's just a bit overwhelming.

59:55.274 --> 59:57.008
If you're overwhelmed by this

59:57.043 --> 59:58.109
imagine what it'll be like

59:58.144 --> 59:59.910
when everyone at the
party sees the dress.

59:59.946 --> 01:00:04.481
We may have to reassign
Barnaby to be your bodyguard.

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:06.416
Right.

01:00:06.452 --> 01:00:08.919
Um... about that.

01:00:08.955 --> 01:00:11.922
I don't think that going to the
party is a great idea for me.

01:00:11.958 --> 01:00:13.323
Nonsense.

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.325
You arranged the entire gala.

01:00:15.394 --> 01:00:16.426
The staff can run it,

01:00:16.462 --> 01:00:18.796
and Abigail will be
here to make sure.

01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:20.631
But when your dress
makes its debut

01:00:20.667 --> 01:00:22.767
everyone will want
to speak to you.

01:00:22.802 --> 01:00:24.702
You will be the
centre of attention.

01:00:24.737 --> 01:00:26.470
Yeah, but I shouldn't be.

01:00:26.505 --> 01:00:28.739
You and Isabelle should be.

01:00:28.775 --> 01:00:32.242
Especially if you're going to...

01:00:32.278 --> 01:00:34.244
Ask her to marry me.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:37.581
Are you going to ask her?

01:00:37.616 --> 01:00:39.550
Well, it certainly is what

01:00:39.585 --> 01:00:42.019
everyone's expecting
me to do, right?

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:46.657
I think that being there
would be very hard for me.

01:00:48.961 --> 01:00:52.730
Are we still talking
about the dress?

01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:55.599
Of course we are.

01:00:55.634 --> 01:00:58.435
There's nothing else we could
be talking about, right?

01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:00.705
I suppose not.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.708
It's a shame, really.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.276
You know, look on
the bright side.

01:01:06.312 --> 01:01:08.345
You got to ride the subway.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:09.646
Yes.

01:01:09.682 --> 01:01:10.781
Yes, yes, I did.

01:01:10.817 --> 01:01:13.050
And I had a delicious hot dog.

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:13.818
Life-changing.

01:01:13.853 --> 01:01:14.719
I told you.

01:01:14.787 --> 01:01:15.753
And what was that cheese on top?

01:01:15.788 --> 01:01:17.321
No. No one knows.

01:01:17.389 --> 01:01:18.923
It is best not to ask
questions like that.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.927
Where did Caitlyn go?

01:01:22.962 --> 01:01:24.494
I wanted to ask her
about the ball.

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.997
Oh, I think she just stepped
out to get some air.

01:01:27.033 --> 01:01:28.265
Is she alright?

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.034
Oh, I'm sure she'll be fine.

01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:32.536
These last few days have
been great for her.

01:01:32.605 --> 01:01:34.438
I don't think I've ever
seen her this happy.

01:01:34.473 --> 01:01:35.706
Because of the dress?

01:01:35.742 --> 01:01:36.573
Yeah.

01:01:36.642 --> 01:01:37.875
Yes.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:40.544
Because of the dress.

01:01:40.579 --> 01:01:43.614
Ok, I've got what I need.

01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:45.082
We'll see you tomorrow.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.283
Oh, I'll walk you down.

01:01:46.352 --> 01:01:47.852
Oh, ok.

01:01:49.188 --> 01:01:52.656
I demand an answer to
this cheese mystery.

01:01:52.691 --> 01:01:54.125
I could threaten to throw
someone in the dungeon

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.359
if I must.

01:01:55.427 --> 01:01:56.060
You throw a lot of people
in dungeons, do you?

01:01:56.095 --> 01:01:57.895
Yes, it's amazing.

01:01:57.930 --> 01:01:59.463
Everybody loves
it in my country.

01:01:59.498 --> 01:02:01.065
There you are.

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.233
Ah, Isabelle.

01:02:02.268 --> 01:02:03.333
We were just-

01:02:03.369 --> 01:02:04.401
Thank you again, Caitlyn.

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:05.702
The dress is simply beautiful.

01:02:05.772 --> 01:02:07.004
You're welcome.

01:02:07.073 --> 01:02:08.205
Uh, we should get going.

01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:09.807
Ok, um, I'll be
back this afternoon

01:02:09.842 --> 01:02:12.176
to go over the placements
of the artwork.

01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:13.210
That's alright, Caitlyn.

01:02:13.246 --> 01:02:14.711
I can take care of it.

01:02:14.747 --> 01:02:17.681
Why don't you focus
on the dress?

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:18.582
Ok.

01:02:18.617 --> 01:02:19.917
Will do.

01:02:19.952 --> 01:02:22.419
Just give a call if
you need anything.

01:02:29.662 --> 01:02:32.997
You know, Isabelle, I can
take care of all the details

01:02:33.032 --> 01:02:33.630
of the ball if you-

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:35.132
Oh, no, no.

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:37.234
We- we must make sure
everything is perfect

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:40.271
before my mother
and father arrive.

01:02:40.306 --> 01:02:43.373
Isabelle, I would have thought
that by now you would have

01:02:43.409 --> 01:02:45.309
learned that when it
comes to our parents

01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:47.878
there is no such
thing as perfection.

01:02:47.914 --> 01:02:51.348
Still, I'll handle
it from here on.

01:02:51.417 --> 01:02:53.050
You need to focus.

01:02:53.085 --> 01:02:54.484
On what?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.853
The future.

01:02:55.922 --> 01:02:58.088
Our future.

01:02:58.124 --> 01:03:00.557
This could be a very important
evening for us, Jeffery.

01:03:00.626 --> 01:03:02.726
Yes, I suppose you're right.

01:03:02.761 --> 01:03:05.229
You're going to be
a king some day.

01:03:05.264 --> 01:03:08.098
And when that happens you'll
need someone by your side

01:03:08.134 --> 01:03:09.834
to support you.

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:13.603
Someone that is acquainted
with our world.

01:03:13.639 --> 01:03:15.706
Someone who is not
all starry-eyed

01:03:15.741 --> 01:03:19.109
over the fairy tale fantasy
of a happy ever after.

01:03:19.145 --> 01:03:21.545
But don't you want fairytale?

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.013
Don't you want
happily ever after?

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:24.982
What I want is you.

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:27.818
The real you.

01:03:27.854 --> 01:03:30.721
I know you've been
enjoying your anonymity

01:03:30.756 --> 01:03:33.423
while we've been
here in New York

01:03:33.492 --> 01:03:35.792
but it's time to say
goodbye to Jeff

01:03:35.828 --> 01:03:38.262
and return to who
you really are.

01:03:38.331 --> 01:03:40.630
Prince Jeffery.

01:03:43.102 --> 01:03:46.670
You know I only want
what's best for you.

01:03:46.739 --> 01:03:48.605
I care about you.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.041
We always say that.

01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:51.942
What?

01:03:51.978 --> 01:03:53.978
That we care for each other.

01:03:54.013 --> 01:03:55.312
Well, it's true, isn't it?

01:03:55.348 --> 01:03:56.546
Yes, yes, yes.

01:03:56.615 --> 01:03:58.482
Of course it is.

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:01.185
But I just sometimes
wonder why we don't say

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:03.420
we love each other more often.

01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:11.228
I'll be in my room
if you need me.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:13.130
Alright.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:24.041
That is a really
beautiful dress.

01:04:24.076 --> 01:04:26.277
You've said that, like, ten
times in the last hour.

01:04:26.312 --> 01:04:30.014
Well, it doesn't make
it any less true.

01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:32.649
Are you really not
gonna go to the party?

01:04:32.718 --> 01:04:34.985
I haven't decided yet.

01:04:35.021 --> 01:04:37.221
Will Abigail even let you
not go to the party?

01:04:37.256 --> 01:04:39.123
Oh, I'm sure she'd
love the opportunity

01:04:39.191 --> 01:04:41.858
to be in the spotlight.

01:04:41.928 --> 01:04:44.661
Well, you know I love you,
and if you don't wanna go

01:04:44.696 --> 01:04:47.197
to the glamorous royal
New Year's Eve party

01:04:47.266 --> 01:04:50.767
then I support you 100 percent.

01:04:50.836 --> 01:04:52.970
But I am totally
going without you.

01:04:54.373 --> 01:04:56.506
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

01:05:01.513 --> 01:05:03.347
Who could that be?

01:05:03.382 --> 01:05:05.416
Oh, I hope it's another prince.

01:05:05.451 --> 01:05:07.051
Does Jeffery have a brother?

01:05:07.086 --> 01:05:09.053
As a matter of fact, he does.

01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:10.487
Really?

01:05:10.522 --> 01:05:12.556
So you mean I still have a
shot at becoming a princess?

01:05:12.591 --> 01:05:13.324
Is he single?

01:05:13.359 --> 01:05:14.458
No.

01:05:14.493 --> 01:05:16.626
My other son is married
with two children.

01:05:16.662 --> 01:05:18.162
Your other son?

01:05:18.197 --> 01:05:19.063
Yes, Peter.

01:05:19.098 --> 01:05:21.398
That would be Jeffery's brother.

01:05:21.434 --> 01:05:24.034
So that would make you the...

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:26.170
King Richard.

01:05:26.205 --> 01:05:27.171
Huh.

01:05:32.778 --> 01:05:35.212
I apologize for the
unannounced visit.

01:05:35.247 --> 01:05:37.281
Barnaby told me where to find
you and I thought it best

01:05:37.316 --> 01:05:39.083
to expedite a conversation.

01:05:39.118 --> 01:05:41.218
Oh, it's ok.

01:05:41.253 --> 01:05:43.920
It's not every day that a king
shows up at your doorstep.

01:05:43.956 --> 01:05:46.090
I hope you don't
mind talking here.

01:05:46.158 --> 01:05:47.358
Oh, not at all.

01:05:47.393 --> 01:05:49.259
It's probably best we
keep Doris away from you.

01:05:49.295 --> 01:05:52.062
She gets a little
excited around royalty.

01:05:52.098 --> 01:05:56.066
Yes, I gathered that after she
attempted to kiss my ring.

01:05:56.102 --> 01:05:57.401
Sorry.

01:05:57.436 --> 01:05:58.869
I'll get straight to the point.

01:05:58.904 --> 01:06:00.137
I came to New York
a little early

01:06:00.172 --> 01:06:03.007
after a call from Lady Isabelle.

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.441
About what?

01:06:04.477 --> 01:06:07.311
Well, she's concerned that
your relationship with Jeffery

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.246
may be complicating
things between them.

01:06:09.315 --> 01:06:12.216
No, Your Majesty, it's-
it's not like that at all.

01:06:12.251 --> 01:06:14.251
We've just been planning the
New Year's Eve ball together.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.852
That is- that is it.

01:06:15.888 --> 01:06:21.058
So you don't have feelings
for Jeffery then?

01:06:21.127 --> 01:06:22.692
The more pressing question,

01:06:22.728 --> 01:06:28.932
of course, is whether those
feelings are reciprocal.

01:06:28.967 --> 01:06:36.806
Jeff, um... Jeffery
is a good man,

01:06:36.842 --> 01:06:38.642
and he's going to
ask Lady Isabelle

01:06:38.677 --> 01:06:40.744
to marry him tomorrow
night as planned.

01:06:40.779 --> 01:06:42.112
Good.

01:06:42.148 --> 01:06:44.114
I'm pleased to hear it.

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:45.949
Can I ask you a question?

01:06:45.984 --> 01:06:48.385
Of course.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:52.622
Have you been happy as king?

01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:58.762
Leading a nation is about
tradition, humility, sacrifice.

01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:02.466
These are things that
last a lifetime.

01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:07.804
Happiness can be
measured in moments.

01:07:07.839 --> 01:07:09.906
Happiness is fleeting.

01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:11.975
Isn't that why we
should hold onto them

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:13.977
for as long as we can?

01:07:19.085 --> 01:07:21.585
Well, it has been very
nice meeting you, Caitlyn.

01:07:21.653 --> 01:07:24.321
It has been a pleasure to
meet you, Your Majesty.

01:07:45.778 --> 01:07:46.710
Hello, father.

01:07:46.745 --> 01:07:49.179
Ah, Jeffery.

01:07:49.214 --> 01:07:51.648
You weren't supposed to
be here 'til tomorrow.

01:07:51.684 --> 01:07:53.016
Yes, well I thought I'd
come a little early,

01:07:53.052 --> 01:07:55.185
make sure things are
still on track.

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.753
Why wouldn't they be?

01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:59.656
I spoke with Caitlyn Enderby
a little while ago.

01:07:59.692 --> 01:08:01.692
You- you did what?

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.227
It's alright, relax, Jeffery.

01:08:04.262 --> 01:08:06.930
I didn't banish her from the
kingdom, we just talked.

01:08:06.965 --> 01:08:08.765
About what?

01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:10.701
The nature of
happiness, it seems.

01:08:10.736 --> 01:08:11.501
What?

01:08:11.536 --> 01:08:12.502
Never mind.

01:08:12.537 --> 01:08:14.270
She seems like a
lovely young woman.

01:08:14.306 --> 01:08:15.605
She is.

01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:19.943
And if circumstances were
different then perhaps...

01:08:19.978 --> 01:08:23.180
look, I have been a king
for a very long time.

01:08:23.215 --> 01:08:25.314
I was 18 when your
grandfather passed away.

01:08:25.383 --> 01:08:26.683
I know.

01:08:26.719 --> 01:08:28.018
It's in the history books.

01:08:28.053 --> 01:08:29.652
Yes. But I prefer not to
be carried off the throne,

01:08:29.688 --> 01:08:32.923
I would prefer to
step down gracefully.

01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:34.323
But in order to do
that I need to know

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.326
that my successor is
ready to step up.

01:08:36.394 --> 01:08:37.928
I know all of this, father.

01:08:37.962 --> 01:08:40.662
Having a stable king is very
important to the country.

01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:42.265
That's why I married your mother

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.867
so soon after I became King.

01:08:43.902 --> 01:08:45.335
And I learned to love her.

01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:47.636
You don't need to
convince me, father.

01:08:47.671 --> 01:08:50.573
I'm prepared to step up.

01:08:50.642 --> 01:08:55.078
But father, if circumstances
were different.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.457
Your life is so weird.

01:09:07.492 --> 01:09:08.992
I know.

01:09:09.027 --> 01:09:11.194
It would be so much easier
if I thought that Jeffery

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:16.299
would be happy but
he doesn't love her.

01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:18.068
I don't think she
loves him, either.

01:09:18.136 --> 01:09:20.303
Well then do something about it.

01:09:20.337 --> 01:09:21.404
What can I do?

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:23.240
Tell him that you're
in love with him.

01:09:23.274 --> 01:09:24.340
I've known him for four days.

01:09:24.376 --> 01:09:25.809
I'm not in love with him.

01:09:25.844 --> 01:09:27.911
Ok, well then tell him that
you're falling in love with him.

01:09:27.946 --> 01:09:30.781
Tell him that you think
he's your soul mate.

01:09:30.816 --> 01:09:33.549
Tell him that you want to live
happily ever after with him

01:09:33.585 --> 01:09:37.921
because you can't deny
that any of that's true.

01:09:37.956 --> 01:09:41.457
Even if it's true,
it doesn't matter.

01:09:41.493 --> 01:09:43.260
Happily ever afters don't exist

01:09:43.295 --> 01:09:47.529
and I don't believe
in fairytales.

01:09:47.599 --> 01:09:49.299
Look at that dress.

01:09:49.367 --> 01:09:53.603
That is a fairytale
waiting to come true.

01:09:53.638 --> 01:09:56.406
But not for me.

01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:01.011
I'm sorry about my father.

01:10:01.046 --> 01:10:03.180
Oh, don't worry about it.

01:10:03.215 --> 01:10:04.781
He's just looking out for you.

01:10:04.817 --> 01:10:05.916
It's his job.

01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:06.883
Still.

01:10:06.919 --> 01:10:08.251
Caitlyn.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.420
Are you sure everything's
ready for the ball tomorrow

01:10:10.455 --> 01:10:11.654
since you won't be there?

01:10:11.723 --> 01:10:12.755
Oh, I'm sure.

01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:15.658
It's going to be wonderful.

01:10:15.694 --> 01:10:18.594
Well then thank you
for everything.

01:10:18.663 --> 01:10:20.763
No, thank you.

01:10:20.799 --> 01:10:21.597
Isabelle?

01:10:21.633 --> 01:10:22.866
We have a huge problem.

01:10:22.901 --> 01:10:24.000
What's wrong?

01:10:24.036 --> 01:10:25.535
Look familiar?

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.072
That's my dress.

01:10:29.107 --> 01:10:31.541
No, it... it can't be.

01:10:31.609 --> 01:10:33.143
Obviously it is.

01:10:33.178 --> 01:10:34.911
Caitlyn stole someone's design

01:10:34.947 --> 01:10:36.546
and she's trying to
pass it off as her own.

01:10:36.581 --> 01:10:37.380
What?

01:10:37.449 --> 01:10:38.315
No, that's- that's not true.

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:39.282
I promise.

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:40.583
Isabelle, I am so sorry,

01:10:40.618 --> 01:10:43.019
but it appears that you
are a victim of a hoax.

01:10:43.055 --> 01:10:44.221
Caitlyn?

01:10:44.256 --> 01:10:46.189
I swear to you, Isabelle,
this is my design.

01:10:46.225 --> 01:10:48.391
Caitlyn, just stop the act.

01:10:48.426 --> 01:10:49.492
No one's buying it.

01:10:49.527 --> 01:10:52.562
There must be some
kind of explanation.

01:10:52.597 --> 01:10:56.032
I don't understand what's
happened, but it has.

01:10:56.068 --> 01:10:57.600
Isabelle, if you'll just
give Caitlyn the chance to-

01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:59.302
I'm sorry.

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:01.104
The idea was to have
something original

01:11:01.139 --> 01:11:04.207
and regardless of the
circumstances I can't wear this.

01:11:04.243 --> 01:11:06.776
Well, luckily you
have a back-up.

01:11:06.811 --> 01:11:09.412
You have a Leighton
Miller original.

01:11:09.481 --> 01:11:12.983
Would you like to
go try it on now?

01:11:13.051 --> 01:11:14.751
Oh, and Caitlyn?

01:11:14.819 --> 01:11:16.386
You're fired.

01:11:23.428 --> 01:11:25.061
Jeffery, I didn't
steal that design.

01:11:25.097 --> 01:11:26.363
I believe you.

01:11:26.398 --> 01:11:27.230
You do?

01:11:27.266 --> 01:11:28.365
Of course.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.367
This dress could only
have come from you.

01:11:33.838 --> 01:11:35.805
I'm sorry.

01:11:41.546 --> 01:11:42.379
Your Highness-

01:11:42.414 --> 01:11:44.014
Don't try to stop me, Barnaby.

01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:45.248
I wasn't.

01:11:45.284 --> 01:11:47.517
I was going to wish you luck.

01:11:49.654 --> 01:11:52.022
You're going to look
amazing in that.

01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:54.958
Well, I suppose
it's good enough.

01:11:54.993 --> 01:11:56.960
I need to speak to Isabelle.

01:11:56.995 --> 01:11:57.760
Oh, well we were just talking-

01:11:57.796 --> 01:11:58.761
Abigail.

01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:59.829
I don't know what just happened

01:11:59.864 --> 01:12:01.664
but I am certain that
you are behind it.

01:12:01.699 --> 01:12:04.401
I suggest you leave quickly
before I call the royal guard

01:12:04.436 --> 01:12:06.536
to have you arrested.

01:12:12.477 --> 01:12:15.211
The royal guard can't arrest
anyone in this country.

01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:17.680
I assumed that she
wouldn't know that.

01:12:17.715 --> 01:12:19.382
Well played.

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:21.017
Well, considering
the circumstances

01:12:21.053 --> 01:12:22.185
I think we should
go double check

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.754
all the arrangements
Caitlyn made.

01:12:24.789 --> 01:12:26.856
I don't think that
will be necessary.

01:12:26.891 --> 01:12:31.561
Jeffery, I know the two
of you became friends

01:12:31.596 --> 01:12:33.830
over the last few days
but we must ensure

01:12:33.865 --> 01:12:37.133
that everything goes
smoothly tonight.

01:12:37.202 --> 01:12:46.609
I'm not going to ask
you to marry me.

01:12:46.644 --> 01:12:47.877
What?

01:12:47.912 --> 01:12:49.045
Isabelle, what just happened?

01:12:49.081 --> 01:12:50.380
Jeffery, I can't
wear that dress.

01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:52.648
It's not about the dress,

01:12:52.717 --> 01:12:54.184
it's not about Caitlyn
for that matter.

01:12:54.219 --> 01:12:55.551
It's about us.

01:12:55.587 --> 01:12:57.354
You and me.

01:12:57.422 --> 01:13:04.560
Are you breaking up with me?

01:13:04.596 --> 01:13:05.761
Isabelle, I am sorry.

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:07.397
But what about the throne?

01:13:07.432 --> 01:13:08.831
Your father will
never accept this.

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.133
Then I'll give up the throne.

01:13:10.202 --> 01:13:11.434
Oh, Jeffery.

01:13:11.503 --> 01:13:16.239
Isabelle, you just called
the dress "good enough".

01:13:16.274 --> 01:13:18.441
None of this is good enough.

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:24.780
And yes, we care about each
other but I don't love you.

01:13:24.816 --> 01:13:28.751
And I don't think that
you love me, either.

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:32.422
I know that I can't just
be a regular person

01:13:32.457 --> 01:13:39.229
but if happily ever after
exists then I want to find it.

01:13:56.714 --> 01:13:59.015
Doris, I need to
speak to Caitlyn.

01:13:59.084 --> 01:14:01.017
It's too late.

01:14:01.053 --> 01:14:01.984
What do you mean?

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.486
She's gone.

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.621
She took a bunch of
her stuff and left.

01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:07.657
Gone where?

01:14:07.692 --> 01:14:10.093
She went to go stay
with her folks.

01:14:10.128 --> 01:14:13.329
I don't think she's coming back.

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:15.498
I see.

01:14:15.567 --> 01:14:20.437
Well... if you speak
to her, tell her...

01:14:20.472 --> 01:14:26.609
tell her thank you
for the hot dogs.

01:14:26.644 --> 01:14:30.180
They were indeed life-changing.

01:14:47.165 --> 01:14:49.466
What does that mean?

01:14:49.501 --> 01:14:51.701
It means goodbye.

01:14:54.172 --> 01:14:56.239
Come here.

01:15:08.686 --> 01:15:11.621
Barnaby, I'm going to spend
some time with the staff

01:15:11.656 --> 01:15:13.923
to make sure everything's in
place for the ball this evening.

01:15:13.992 --> 01:15:15.325
Yes, Your Highness.

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.560
Your father has gone out,
he asked me to tell you

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:19.562
he wishes to speak to
you when he returns.

01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:20.363
Right.

01:15:20.398 --> 01:15:21.864
Yes.

01:15:21.933 --> 01:15:24.867
Is it childish of me to put
that off as long as possible?

01:15:24.902 --> 01:15:28.304
Not at all, Your Highness.

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:31.007
And I need you to run
an errand for me.

01:15:31.042 --> 01:15:32.475
Certainly.

01:15:32.511 --> 01:15:34.377
Please deliver this to Doris.

01:15:34.412 --> 01:15:37.147
Ask her if she will send it to
Caitlyn at her parent's home

01:15:37.182 --> 01:15:39.482
in Connecticut.

01:15:39.551 --> 01:15:41.717
Sir, if I may?

01:15:41.753 --> 01:15:44.086
Perhaps you should
deliver this in person.

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:45.755
Connecticut isn't far.

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:48.525
I didn't get a chance to
say a proper goodbye.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.762
I don't know if I could
do that in person.

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:54.531
Please, Barnaby.

01:16:07.924 --> 01:16:11.092
Doris ratted me out, huh?

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:16.364
I promised to ask the King
to make her a Duchess.

01:16:16.399 --> 01:16:19.567
I always liked you, Barnaby.

01:16:19.603 --> 01:16:22.537
I have something for you.

01:16:22.572 --> 01:16:24.606
Great. Isabelle is suing me?

01:16:24.641 --> 01:16:26.307
No, it's from...

01:16:27.944 --> 01:16:31.812
Miss Caitlyn, may I ask you
a rather personal question?

01:16:31.881 --> 01:16:33.881
Sure.

01:16:33.916 --> 01:16:39.053
When did you realize
you liked him?

01:16:39.088 --> 01:16:41.789
Here.

01:16:41.824 --> 01:16:45.660
The coffee shop after
he returned my phone.

01:16:45.695 --> 01:16:50.164
He was telling me how he
had ridden the subway

01:16:50.199 --> 01:16:56.137
and it was this incredible
journey and so joyful,

01:16:56.172 --> 01:16:58.172
and I thought how nice it
would be to have someone

01:16:58.241 --> 01:17:01.643
that could experience that
kind of joy in my life.

01:17:11.888 --> 01:17:13.288
What's this?

01:17:13.323 --> 01:17:15.256
Invitation to the ball tonight.

01:17:15.292 --> 01:17:16.691
Barnaby, I can't go to that.

01:17:16.726 --> 01:17:18.493
Prince Jeffery will
not be proposing

01:17:18.528 --> 01:17:20.161
to Lady Isabelle tonight.

01:17:20.196 --> 01:17:22.597
What?

01:17:22.632 --> 01:17:23.498
He didn't do that because-

01:17:23.533 --> 01:17:24.399
No, no.

01:17:24.467 --> 01:17:25.866
It wasn't because of you.

01:17:25.935 --> 01:17:31.138
He did that for himself and
for Lady Isabelle, I think.

01:17:31.174 --> 01:17:33.541
I'm proud of him.

01:17:33.576 --> 01:17:35.943
I'm happy for him.

01:17:35.978 --> 01:17:38.212
I still can't go to that ball.

01:17:38.247 --> 01:17:39.747
Why not?

01:17:39.783 --> 01:17:44.419
Because I liked being in that
world for a little, it was fun.

01:17:44.454 --> 01:17:47.322
Princes and Kings

01:17:47.357 --> 01:17:50.758
and fairytale gowns made
for princesses, but...

01:17:52.395 --> 01:17:54.995
fairytales aren't real.

01:17:55.064 --> 01:17:56.997
Not for people like me.

01:17:57.033 --> 01:18:01.101
Caitlyn, we are
approaching the new year.

01:18:01.137 --> 01:18:03.504
It's a time of wishes
and dreams and hopes

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.506
for what lies ahead.

01:18:05.575 --> 01:18:07.542
Anything is possible.

01:18:07.577 --> 01:18:10.611
Even if I wanted to go I
don't have anything to wear.

01:18:10.647 --> 01:18:15.216
You designed a dress
fit for a princess.

01:18:15.284 --> 01:18:18.786
It would be a shame for
it not to be worn.

01:18:27.797 --> 01:18:28.763
Thank you, Barnaby.

01:18:28.798 --> 01:18:30.798
You're welcome.

01:19:01.931 --> 01:19:03.598
Father.

01:19:05.067 --> 01:19:06.567
Jeffery.

01:19:06.603 --> 01:19:08.770
I went to check on Isabelle this
morning and imagine my surprise

01:19:08.838 --> 01:19:11.739
when I found out that she
was not coming to the ball

01:19:11.775 --> 01:19:13.107
because you broke up with her.

01:19:13.142 --> 01:19:14.509
We don't love each other.

01:19:14.544 --> 01:19:15.676
We had a deal.

01:19:15.712 --> 01:19:17.412
This was part of your
taking the throne.

01:19:17.447 --> 01:19:18.813
I don't want the throne.

01:19:18.882 --> 01:19:19.614
What?

01:19:19.682 --> 01:19:21.015
Give it to Peter.

01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:22.784
At least one of your sons
won't be a disappointment.

01:19:22.819 --> 01:19:24.919
Jeffery you are not
a disappointment.

01:19:24.954 --> 01:19:28.823
A frustration, perhaps,
but not a disappointment.

01:19:28.858 --> 01:19:29.924
Is this about Caitlyn?

01:19:29.959 --> 01:19:30.858
No.

01:19:30.894 --> 01:19:32.960
I mean, not like that.

01:19:32.995 --> 01:19:35.797
But she showed me it's
not about the titles

01:19:35.865 --> 01:19:37.364
or the fancy clothes we wear,

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.667
it's about what makes
us truly happy.

01:19:39.702 --> 01:19:41.803
And does she make you happy?

01:19:41.838 --> 01:19:44.138
Very much so.

01:19:44.173 --> 01:19:47.909
Well, as a wise young
woman once said

01:19:47.944 --> 01:19:51.345
"you should hold on to happiness
for as long as you can".

01:19:51.414 --> 01:19:52.880
But the circumstances.

01:19:52.916 --> 01:19:55.316
I created the circumstances.

01:19:55.351 --> 01:19:56.484
I can change them.

01:19:56.519 --> 01:19:57.552
Are you sure?

01:19:57.587 --> 01:19:58.920
I'm the King.

01:19:58.955 --> 01:20:00.788
I can do whatever I like.

01:20:06.329 --> 01:20:08.395
Your Majesty.

01:20:08.431 --> 01:20:09.464
Isabelle.

01:20:09.532 --> 01:20:11.165
Jeffery.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.934
Aren't you going to
ask me to dance?

01:20:12.969 --> 01:20:14.569
For old time's sake.

01:20:14.604 --> 01:20:16.571
Of course.

01:20:24.447 --> 01:20:26.581
I have a New Year's resolution.

01:20:26.616 --> 01:20:27.748
Would you like to hear it?

01:20:27.817 --> 01:20:29.216
Very much so.

01:20:29.251 --> 01:20:32.052
I shouldn't settle for
good enough anymore.

01:20:32.088 --> 01:20:33.788
Neither of us should.

01:20:33.823 --> 01:20:35.255
That's a good resolution.

01:20:35.291 --> 01:20:38.025
And maybe there really is a
fairytale out there waiting

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.961
to come true for both of us.

01:20:39.996 --> 01:20:43.931
I haven't found mine yet but
you may have found yours

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.933
and I can't be the one
to keep you from it.

01:20:45.969 --> 01:20:48.035
I care about you too much.

01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:49.670
Thank you.

01:21:19.769 --> 01:21:21.702
You have some nerve
showing up here.

01:21:21.738 --> 01:21:22.670
Mom!

01:21:22.705 --> 01:21:24.005
Leave her alone.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.205
Leighton.

01:21:25.241 --> 01:21:27.141
Caitlyn, I am really
sorry about everything.

01:21:27.209 --> 01:21:28.475
She took a picture of your dress

01:21:28.511 --> 01:21:29.510
then had the magazine's
art department

01:21:29.546 --> 01:21:31.913
mock up that picture
for the paper.

01:21:31.948 --> 01:21:33.414
Why are you telling me this?

01:21:33.449 --> 01:21:37.284
Because I'm hoping maybe you'll
show me how you can come up

01:21:37.319 --> 01:21:39.554
with something so beautiful.

01:21:39.589 --> 01:21:42.456
And maybe give me tickets
to your first show.

01:21:42.491 --> 01:21:44.058
You really think that
I can have a show?

01:21:44.093 --> 01:21:47.862
I know you will because Appliqué
magazine is going to sponsor it.

01:21:47.897 --> 01:21:48.963
Isn't that right, mom?

01:21:49.032 --> 01:21:49.997
Well, I can't just-

01:21:50.033 --> 01:21:51.498
Mom, can you really
just stand there

01:21:51.534 --> 01:21:54.535
and tell me that this
dress isn't amazing?

01:22:00.476 --> 01:22:01.876
It's very nice.

01:22:01.911 --> 01:22:03.544
Thank you, Abigail.

01:22:05.915 --> 01:22:08.049
And if you would like
your job back...

01:22:09.686 --> 01:22:11.852
No, but thank you.

01:22:11.888 --> 01:22:13.955
It's almost midnight.

01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:16.256
It's time for a fresh start.

01:22:23.766 --> 01:22:26.901
May I have this dance?

01:22:26.936 --> 01:22:28.469
I would love to.

01:22:28.537 --> 01:22:31.639
You look beautiful.

01:22:39.949 --> 01:22:41.082
Thank you.

01:22:41.150 --> 01:22:42.349
For what?

01:22:42.384 --> 01:22:46.487
For helping me to believe
in fairytales again.

01:22:46.522 --> 01:22:49.890
What about the tradition of
proposing on New Year's Eve?

01:22:49.926 --> 01:22:52.259
I heard they have
one every year.

01:22:52.328 --> 01:22:54.495
If you're not busy...

01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:55.896
I'm not busy.

01:22:57.166 --> 01:23:03.004
six... five... four... three...
two... one...

01:23:03.039 --> 01:23:04.605
Happy New Year!

01:23:04.641 --> 01:23:05.840
Happy New Year.

01:23:14.917 --> 01:23:15.850
Happy New Year.

01:23:15.885 --> 01:23:17.652
Happy New Year.
