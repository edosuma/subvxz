WEBVTT

00:45.545 --> 00:46.379
Do you regret it?

00:48.673 --> 00:51.634
Do you regret what we did?

00:56.556 --> 00:57.390
Yes.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.351
I regret it.

01:04.022 --> 01:07.400
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we did.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.070
But I won't blame you.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.405
I brought it on myself.

01:14.449 --> 01:17.577
I knew there was no happy ending for us,

01:18.286 --> 01:22.123
but I was an idiot for getting my hopes up
and thinking you could be sincere.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.713
You told me that I had
the right to decide our relationship.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.219
I don't want to see you ever again.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.265
<i>To be honest,</i>

02:21.850 --> 02:23.059
<i>I already knew</i>

02:24.769 --> 02:26.396
<i>that this wasn't love.</i>

03:19.073 --> 03:20.617
<i>I think I know now.</i>

03:23.161 --> 03:25.079
<i>That I'm the one</i>

03:27.290 --> 03:28.625
<i>who ruined everything.</i>

04:25.848 --> 04:27.976
<i>I couldn't sleep at all.</i>

04:29.560 --> 04:30.937
<i>I regret it.</i>

04:31.521 --> 04:35.066
You, this messed up relationship,
and everything we did.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.152
<i>Na-bi's pained expression</i>

04:39.487 --> 04:41.281
<i>and her tearful voice</i>

04:42.156 --> 04:44.325
<i>lingered in my head all night.</i>

05:20.236 --> 05:22.447
<i>Funnily enough, what kept me up all night</i>

05:23.156 --> 05:25.199
<i>weren't the harsh words he said to me,</i>

05:25.908 --> 05:28.036
<i>but his warm eyes,</i>

05:28.953 --> 05:31.080
<i>his gentle voice when he called me,</i>

05:31.873 --> 05:33.708
<i>and his soft touch.</i>

05:35.293 --> 05:36.878
I'm so pathetic.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.564
-Hey, Na-bi.
-Hey.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.107
No hangover?

05:58.900 --> 05:59.984
No.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.280
We drank so much after you left.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.491
I never saw Jae-eon drink that much.

06:06.574 --> 06:09.535
I almost died trying to keep up with him.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.626
Jin-su…

06:18.961 --> 06:21.881
You don't have to help me
with my piece anymore.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.718
I can do the rest myself.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.178
Why? This is so sudden.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.473
Well, it's our exam period now.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.518
And I got most of the work done.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.853
Can you tell Jae-eon too?

06:37.438 --> 06:38.898
Okay, then.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.442
Thanks.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.639
Do you have a lot to do?

07:54.724 --> 07:55.558
What?

07:55.641 --> 07:56.809
Hey.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.314
Hey!

08:01.397 --> 08:03.065
What? What is it?

08:03.149 --> 08:05.109
Did you see Gyu-hyun and Bit-na?

08:05.193 --> 08:07.528
No, I don't think so.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.822
Jeez. What's going on with them?

08:10.406 --> 08:13.576
They were fighting all the time,
and now they're leaving me out.

08:14.577 --> 08:18.039
No way. How did she know
I was talking about her?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.709
-What?
-Hey!

08:21.792 --> 08:24.212
I heard you're in our department office.
Is that true?

08:24.295 --> 08:26.797
<i>-Yes. How did you know?</i>
-That's such a relief.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.010
Do you see a laptop near the shelves?

08:31.093 --> 08:32.303
A laptop?

08:33.387 --> 08:34.680
Yes, it's here.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.099
<i>There's a file dated today on the desktop.</i>

08:37.183 --> 08:38.726
<i>Can you send that to me?</i>

08:38.809 --> 08:40.603
What will you do for me, then?

08:40.686 --> 08:43.356
<i>My gosh. Fine, I'll buy you fried chicken.</i>

08:43.439 --> 08:45.900
Okay! Hang on a second.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.365
All right.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.911
Hello?

08:57.703 --> 08:59.080
What's the file…

08:59.580 --> 09:01.582
Hey, it's locked. What's the password?

09:01.666 --> 09:02.792
What?

09:04.001 --> 09:06.295
Oh, right. The password…

09:09.006 --> 09:10.091
Well…

09:10.174 --> 09:12.927
What is it?
Is it the same as your bank account?

09:13.010 --> 09:14.053
I won't steal your money.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.680
Just tell me.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.519
"Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun."

09:22.019 --> 09:23.396
<i>Hang on.</i>

09:23.479 --> 09:25.898
<i>What did you say? I can't hear you.</i>

09:28.150 --> 09:31.112
"Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun."

09:31.195 --> 09:34.156
<i>Jeez. What are you saying?
I can't hear you!</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:37.285
Darn it! "Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun"!

09:39.120 --> 09:40.079
What?

09:40.788 --> 09:42.039
What did you just say?

09:43.874 --> 09:46.711
"Totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun"?

09:46.794 --> 09:48.004
What?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.590
You don't mean the Nam Gyu-hyun
I know, do you?

09:51.173 --> 09:53.968
If you don't send it in five minutes,
you're dead.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.595
Thank you so much, buddy.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.185
I understand.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.939
-Your cake is ready.
-I want to die.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.567
The totally hot Nam Gyu-hyun
will go get it.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.694
Hey, don't tease me!

10:11.777 --> 10:13.112
-I'll be back.
-Jeez!

10:13.195 --> 10:15.489
Don't make that cheesy voice!
Or I'll kill you!

10:15.573 --> 10:19.535
Jeez! I just want to die.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.470
YU NA-BI

11:24.141 --> 11:26.018
And you say you really like me?

11:26.602 --> 11:27.937
That's nonsense.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.150
Hey, Na-bi.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.110
Hi.

12:18.237 --> 12:21.407
You seemed to have lost more weight.
Are you okay?

12:22.158 --> 12:23.534
I didn't get much sleep.

12:24.827 --> 12:25.953
You must be overworking.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.209
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen Jae-eon at all these days.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.795
He was acting like
he was working so hard to help you.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.717
I said I'd finish my piece by myself.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.261
It's almost over, anyway.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.305
Oh, really?

12:44.388 --> 12:46.849
I thought he was…

12:46.932 --> 12:49.143
We'll head inside first.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.352
Okay.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.820
What's Na-bi going to do?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.489
This is terrible.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.783
She won't be able to hand it in
before the exhibition.

13:04.867 --> 13:08.704
I can't believe it.
Why did it have to fall right here?

13:10.164 --> 13:11.290
What's going on?

13:11.874 --> 13:14.335
How did this fan fall from the ceiling?

13:18.881 --> 13:20.216
Hey, Na-bi!

13:40.402 --> 13:43.697
-Why did it…
-Let's go. Stop looking.

13:44.448 --> 13:47.076
Go back to your work. Stop staring and go.

13:47.910 --> 13:48.869
Hey…

14:13.978 --> 14:15.271
Na-bi…

14:18.649 --> 14:21.151
What happened? Why is it…

14:28.659 --> 14:29.827
Na-bi!

14:30.494 --> 14:31.871
Na-bi, are you okay?

14:38.669 --> 14:40.421
All right.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.756
How can such a thing happen?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.009
Someone could have been hurt!

14:45.593 --> 14:47.261
I can't believe it.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.808
Let's get everything repaired properly
so this will never happen again.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.018
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.479
How is Na-bi? She must be in shock.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.232
Yes, she is…

15:01.609 --> 15:03.569
She won't have enough time to fix it.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.030
And it's their exam period now.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.282
I can't tell her to work on it right now…

15:08.365 --> 15:10.451
It's not even her fault.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.830
Right. Don't push her
to do anything right now.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.500
If she says she'll give up,
then we have no choice.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.396
<i>It feels like I'm having terrible,
recurring nightmares.</i>

16:38.330 --> 16:39.873
<i>HUMAN ART ANATOMY FOR SCULPTORS</i>

16:41.917 --> 16:44.336
This is the transverse arch?

16:44.920 --> 16:45.838
Yes.

16:46.588 --> 16:49.258
And this is the medial longitudinal arch.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.137
-Yes.
-This is the lateral longitudinal arch.

16:53.679 --> 16:54.972
Correct.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.185
-What about this?
-Stop. It tickles.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.603
Stop.

17:29.423 --> 17:30.424
Hello?

17:31.967 --> 17:33.302
Oh, Yun Sol.

17:35.721 --> 17:36.722
What?

18:52.422 --> 18:53.549
Let's fix this.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.200
And when we're done,

19:21.660 --> 19:23.162
I'll stay away from you.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.126
I promise.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.235
We can't even blame anyone.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.654
Jin-su, give me the gloves.

20:05.662 --> 20:06.747
Let's clean this up.

20:47.746 --> 20:52.000
<i>I don't know how I should feel
about Jae-eon,</i>

20:59.883 --> 21:02.261
<i>but focusing on work together</i>

21:03.679 --> 21:05.847
<i>feels natural and comfortable.</i>

21:08.558 --> 21:11.436
<i>It's as if nothing had happened
between us.</i>

21:18.735 --> 21:21.321
Sorry I'm late. But I got these for you.

22:10.078 --> 22:10.912
Try this.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.582
Eat up.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.546
-Do you want some too?
-Yes.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.049
-Thank you.
-Want a sausage?

22:22.132 --> 22:23.717
-Yes!
-Here.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.302
Hey…

23:41.253 --> 23:43.463
<i>Jae-eon is still kind, but…</i>

24:08.238 --> 24:09.531
You have a lot of stuff.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.951
Yes. I called a cab.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.245
Right.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.290
<i>He doesn't offer to take me home anymore.</i>

24:27.090 --> 24:29.593
<i>The conflicts we had whenever we met</i>

24:30.719 --> 24:32.137
<i>are gone, too.</i>

24:36.016 --> 24:37.767
How about having some beer?

24:38.351 --> 24:41.104
We have to come early tomorrow.
Maybe next time.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.272
Come on.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.945
I'll get going.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.407
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.493
Get home safe.

24:57.704 --> 25:01.291
Jae-eon. I'll leave
after I finish up some work.

25:01.791 --> 25:02.959
Okay.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.492
-I…
-Is it okay?

25:36.201 --> 25:38.245
Yes. I think it's all done.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.499
I'll move this.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.422
No, I'll do it. It's heavy.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.076
Well…

27:07.417 --> 27:08.543
Thank you.

27:21.890 --> 27:25.727
You look the happiest
when you're working on your pieces.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.440
And the prettiest.

27:33.443 --> 27:34.903
Good luck with the exhibition.

27:36.696 --> 27:37.864
And…

27:50.794 --> 27:52.045
I'll get going.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.506
Jae-eon, what are you doing?

28:39.884 --> 28:41.719
What is all this?

28:42.595 --> 28:43.638
My tools.

28:44.264 --> 28:47.308
I know, but why are you taking everything?

28:50.895 --> 28:51.813
Do you want them?

28:53.148 --> 28:54.607
What about you?

28:54.691 --> 28:56.151
Oh, are you getting new ones?

29:02.532 --> 29:03.575
Never mind, then.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.995
I want them! Thanks.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.782
You look the happiest
when you're working on your pieces.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.494
<i>But why…</i>

29:49.496 --> 29:51.539
<i>do I not feel happy?</i>

30:07.472 --> 30:09.265
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.017
Here.

30:13.561 --> 30:16.147
Hey, this is mine. Where did you get it?

30:16.231 --> 30:18.066
Jae-eon asked me to give it to you.

30:20.401 --> 30:22.737
Really? Thanks.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.865
-I'll clean up a bit.
-Okay.

31:09.659 --> 31:13.746
<i>I don't think I can stay by her side any
longer in a vague relationship like this.</i>

32:33.910 --> 32:35.828
<i>The semester's finally over!</i>

32:37.622 --> 32:39.832
Shall we celebrate?

32:39.916 --> 32:41.668
-Yes!
-Nice!

32:41.751 --> 32:43.419
Are you that happy, guys?

32:43.503 --> 32:46.589
-What?
-I just feel anxious now.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.925
We have to start preparing
to get jobs now.

32:49.008 --> 32:51.678
I'm so scared about my exam results.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.933
Oh, right. This is Jae-eon's.
Is anyone keeping in touch with him?

32:57.016 --> 32:58.476
-Bye!
-Oh…

32:59.602 --> 33:01.270
Jin-su, you can't reach him either?

33:01.354 --> 33:05.233
No. I guess we weren't close friends.
I thought we grew quite close.

33:06.442 --> 33:08.569
Jae-eon even took all his tools and stuff.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.780
He took
all his former projects and everything.

33:10.863 --> 33:15.076
<i>After that day,
Jae-eon disappeared without a trace.</i>

33:15.576 --> 33:17.662
Is it a young artist's spirit
or something?

33:18.788 --> 33:19.747
Maybe he sold them.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.250
I think he took everything apart
and threw them away.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.669
He did seem strange that day.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.379
Classes weren't even over yet,

33:26.462 --> 33:28.464
but he packed up
like he was going somewhere.

33:28.548 --> 33:29.465
Right, Na-bi?

33:30.216 --> 33:32.301
Maybe he really went somewhere.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.345
He did talk about going to the States.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.347
Good luck with the exhibition.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.308
And…

33:46.274 --> 33:50.028
<i>What did he want to tell me?</i>

33:50.111 --> 33:51.612
How can he just leave like that?

33:51.696 --> 33:54.198
With his personality,
it's totally possible.

33:54.282 --> 33:57.577
I guess nobody knows
that much about Jae-eon.

33:58.578 --> 34:01.873
Jae-eon doesn't talk much about himself.

34:01.956 --> 34:03.541
But you know something, right?

34:03.624 --> 34:04.917
What would I know?

34:05.001 --> 34:06.669
You really don't know?

34:06.753 --> 34:07.962
-No.
-Didn't you know?

34:08.046 --> 34:10.214
She retired from her gossip columnist job.

34:10.298 --> 34:11.382
She's busy dating!

34:11.466 --> 34:13.468
Bit-na is dating!

34:14.093 --> 34:15.636
Let's go.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.514
Hey, we're going to drink near school,

34:18.598 --> 34:19.849
so come and join us.

34:19.932 --> 34:21.517
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.686
-You should come!
-All right.

34:43.498 --> 34:47.877
SHARK

34:51.631 --> 34:52.840
SHARK

34:53.341 --> 34:54.509
This one.

35:01.432 --> 35:02.642
Why did you laugh?

35:06.020 --> 35:07.146
Because you're cute.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.473
<i>Didn't you want to see me again?</i>

35:47.311 --> 35:48.855
I was glad…

35:50.189 --> 35:51.524
to see you again.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.289
You jerk.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.680
Excuse me.

37:04.764 --> 37:07.058
Aren't you
"Grandson of a Noodle Shop Owner"?

37:07.642 --> 37:09.018
Oh, yes. I am.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.021
I can't believe it. Hi.

37:12.521 --> 37:13.940
I'm a huge fan.

37:14.023 --> 37:17.568
I've been watching your videos
since the beginning.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.569
Thank you.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.530
Could we get an autograph?

37:22.406 --> 37:25.201
-An autograph?
-Yes, please.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.002
YANG

37:44.595 --> 37:46.347
YANG DO-HYEOK

37:47.765 --> 37:50.559
Thank you. Could we take a photo as well?

37:51.435 --> 37:52.728
A photo?

37:53.562 --> 37:54.563
Do it.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.192
My friend's here.

37:58.776 --> 37:59.777
Sorry.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.367
Hey! Aren't you
"Grandson of a Noodle Shop Owner"?

38:06.909 --> 38:08.995
Can I have an autograph too?

38:11.580 --> 38:13.499
Your semester's finally over.

38:13.582 --> 38:16.752
Yes. This semester felt like one year.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.047
Are you going to stay in Seoul?

38:20.131 --> 38:23.926
No, I'm going to my mom's
after the exhibition is over.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.470
She's nagging at me to come.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.598
What about your aunt?

38:30.266 --> 38:33.519
Do-yeon seems to miss you a lot too.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.484
That was obvious, wasn't it?

38:42.069 --> 38:43.487
Yes, that was an excuse.

38:44.113 --> 38:47.033
I did tell my aunt that I'd visit soon.

38:47.992 --> 38:51.454
I don't think I can stay
with my mom during my whole vacation.

38:52.913 --> 38:54.957
The exhibition's until seven, right?

38:55.624 --> 38:57.335
Yes. But can you come?

38:57.418 --> 39:00.254
Didn't you say you were filming something?
An interview?

39:00.338 --> 39:03.341
It might be a little tight, but…

39:03.424 --> 39:06.093
Then it's fine.
Don't strain yourself. Just focus on work.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.013
No, I have to make it.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.681
It's your exhibition.

39:12.391 --> 39:13.684
I'm excited to see it.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.064
It's amazing how you fixed your piece.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.275
I wouldn't have been able to do it.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.572
My assistants helped out a lot.

39:35.414 --> 39:37.625
Anyway, it was pretty tough,

39:37.708 --> 39:41.420
but I did gain some things too.

39:42.296 --> 39:43.214
Like what?

39:47.802 --> 39:49.178
I like working now.

39:50.096 --> 39:53.724
To be honest,
I wasn't enjoying it for a while,

39:54.350 --> 39:58.479
but someone told me that I look
the happiest when I'm working.

40:01.482 --> 40:02.775
I was happy…

40:05.903 --> 40:06.987
to hear that.

40:10.157 --> 40:13.452
Maybe you actually did
enjoy it the whole time.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.621
And you just realized it

40:16.705 --> 40:18.332
when you heard those words.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.295
Maybe.

40:30.553 --> 40:31.971
You must be grateful to them.

40:34.390 --> 40:35.391
Right.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.154
Let's eat.

40:48.654 --> 40:51.490
-Try it. It's really tasty.
-Okay.

41:01.667 --> 41:04.336
Gosh. Everything will be over tomorrow.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.172
Finally.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.632
I thought I'd be happy for it to all end.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.722
But I guess I was wrong.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.019
Is Jae-eon coming tomorrow?

41:20.895 --> 41:21.979
I don't know.

42:35.886 --> 42:38.264
<i>How can I define</i>

42:39.390 --> 42:41.559
<i>the feelings I have left for Jae-eon?</i>

42:45.521 --> 42:46.480
<i>Lingering affection?</i>

42:47.815 --> 42:49.024
<i>Regret?</i>

42:50.442 --> 42:51.485
<i>Hate?</i>

42:53.445 --> 42:54.905
<i>Or…</i>

43:33.736 --> 43:35.571
<i>Honestly, I didn't want to come.</i>

43:35.654 --> 43:37.156
Why?

43:37.239 --> 43:39.116
It wasn't because of the exhibition.

43:41.243 --> 43:43.537
I just have bad memories about this place.

43:44.788 --> 43:45.664
Really?

43:47.833 --> 43:50.294
I saw someone so beautiful here

43:51.253 --> 43:53.047
that I fell in love at first sight.

43:54.715 --> 43:55.966
I'm sure.

43:57.092 --> 43:58.761
It was snowing that day.

43:58.844 --> 43:59.928
I didn't ask.

44:00.012 --> 44:02.014
It was an opening exhibition
for an artist.

44:02.097 --> 44:03.766
What was the artist's name?

44:03.849 --> 44:05.643
But why is it called "Nabi"?

44:05.726 --> 44:07.061
I don't know.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.814
<i>It was boring, so I was about to leave.</i>

44:11.940 --> 44:13.317
<i>But then…</i>

44:14.151 --> 44:16.820
<i>I saw a girl standing
in front of a piece for a long time.</i>

44:17.529 --> 44:18.906
<i>Just like you back there.</i>

44:32.294 --> 44:33.712
Na-bi.

44:51.438 --> 44:55.401
<i>And one day, I ran into her again.</i>

44:55.484 --> 44:56.527
<i>I was startled.</i>

44:57.027 --> 44:59.238
<i>If I believed in fate,</i>

44:59.780 --> 45:01.573
<i>I would have felt that this was it.</i>

45:20.300 --> 45:23.512
PARK JAE-EON

45:25.931 --> 45:30.144
<i>The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave a message…</i>

45:57.880 --> 46:02.217
Oh, my gosh.
"Hello. Hi. It's nice to meet you."

46:08.348 --> 46:10.017
-Jo Min-yeong!
-What?

46:10.100 --> 46:11.560
Your phone!

46:11.643 --> 46:14.897
Oh, my gosh! I almost got in huge trouble.

46:15.481 --> 46:18.525
Stay calm during the interview.
And here, take this.

46:18.609 --> 46:19.818
What is it?

46:19.902 --> 46:22.946
Sugar. You get low on sugar
when you're anxious.

46:26.742 --> 46:27.993
YOU CAN DO IT, MIN-YEONG!

46:28.952 --> 46:31.330
Sorry I can't help with the exhibition.

46:31.413 --> 46:33.916
It'll go fine without you, so don't worry.

46:33.999 --> 46:35.042
Focus on the interview.

46:35.125 --> 46:36.835
Okay? Come on, you should go.

46:36.919 --> 46:39.087
Right. See you later!

46:42.883 --> 46:44.218
You can do it!

46:44.301 --> 46:45.886
I can do it!

48:32.117 --> 48:33.285
Don't think of going home tonight.

48:33.368 --> 48:35.787
-Hey, Bit-na!
-Hey!

48:35.871 --> 48:37.748
-Hi!
-Oh, no. I didn't buy flowers.

48:38.707 --> 48:41.126
-Ji-wan bought them for me.
-I sure did.

48:41.209 --> 48:43.170
Are you excited?

48:43.253 --> 48:45.797
Hey, Yun Sol's piece is the best!

48:45.881 --> 48:48.842
We haven't even entered the gallery yet.

48:49.343 --> 48:50.427
I can just tell.

48:50.510 --> 48:53.138
-She's praising you all the time.
-Hey, be quiet.

48:54.806 --> 48:57.809
Here, ten each. Hand these out.

48:57.893 --> 48:58.727
Here.

48:59.227 --> 49:01.688
Hey, can you hand these out?

49:01.772 --> 49:03.774
-Mr. An, can you take a photo of us?
-What?

49:03.857 --> 49:06.568
-Come on. Hurry.
-Hold onto this for me.

49:06.652 --> 49:07.944
-Hurry.
-All right.

49:08.028 --> 49:10.155
-Make me look tall.
-Okay.

49:10.238 --> 49:12.908
Make a pose. All right. One, two, three.

49:12.991 --> 49:14.034
-Mr. An!
-Mr. An!

49:14.117 --> 49:15.994
-One more.
-Hang on.

49:16.078 --> 49:18.372
-Gosh, look at you!
-That's enough for you guys.

49:18.455 --> 49:19.748
-All right.
-You look good.

49:19.831 --> 49:21.875
Can you take one for us too?

49:21.958 --> 49:24.002
You look like a different person today.

49:24.086 --> 49:25.337
You look really nice today.

49:26.838 --> 49:29.549
One, two, three.

49:30.050 --> 49:31.218
Once more.

49:31.718 --> 49:33.261
-I'll do a close-up.
-Focus on Sol.

49:33.345 --> 49:35.180
Sol? One, two, three.

49:35.681 --> 49:36.765
YU NA-BI, YUN SOL,
KIM NA-YEON, YUN GEON-UNG

49:36.848 --> 49:38.850
-Hey!
-Hey, guys!

49:39.601 --> 49:41.728
Why did no one bring flowers?

49:41.812 --> 49:43.438
Hey, you look so pretty!

49:43.522 --> 49:45.607
-I should've brought some.
-I'm a flower.

49:45.691 --> 49:48.944
-I'm a flower.
-Why would we need flowers? I'm a flower.

49:49.027 --> 49:50.696
-Jin-su, it's your debut!
-You're so late.

49:50.779 --> 49:53.865
Right,
I worked on Na-bi's piece with Jae-eon.

49:53.949 --> 49:55.617
-Be quiet, you guys.
-They're pretty.

49:55.701 --> 49:57.160
-Mr. An!
-Gosh, you're handsome.

49:57.244 --> 49:59.287
Be quiet, guys. Go inside.

49:59.371 --> 50:01.164
Come on. Get inside.

50:03.875 --> 50:05.043
This place is cool.

50:06.211 --> 50:08.255
Hey, look over there.

50:08.338 --> 50:09.965
This is…

50:10.048 --> 50:11.633
Hey, Sol.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.183
Congratulations.

50:20.809 --> 50:22.060
Good work.

50:25.355 --> 50:28.316
It feels different looking at them
exhibited like this.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.860
It's so cool.

50:29.943 --> 50:32.112
Sol really is talented. You're awesome.

50:32.195 --> 50:34.239
Sol, what was the name of this?

50:35.198 --> 50:36.908
-"Union."
-"Onion"?

50:36.992 --> 50:38.285
-"Union."
-Stop making jokes.

50:38.368 --> 50:40.996
Sol, you really are the best.

50:41.496 --> 50:43.665
Sol, you're awesome.

50:56.428 --> 50:57.471
What's that?

50:58.096 --> 51:01.641
Na-bi's piece is really amazing.

51:01.725 --> 51:02.768
Right?

51:02.851 --> 51:04.686
Maybe the accident actually helped her.

51:04.770 --> 51:06.855
No, Na-bi wouldn't be happy to hear that.

51:08.523 --> 51:11.943
Na-bi could really go to Paris
at this rate.

51:12.027 --> 51:14.613
-No way.
-This is incredible.

51:15.447 --> 51:16.615
Where's Na-bi?

51:16.698 --> 51:18.700
Right. Where is she?

51:18.784 --> 51:20.452
There she is. Hang on.

51:34.591 --> 51:35.717
What are you doing?

51:37.219 --> 51:40.722
I was a bit tired,
so I was getting some rest.

51:40.806 --> 51:43.391
Na-bi. The professor's calling for you.

51:43.475 --> 51:44.518
Okay.

51:49.105 --> 51:50.232
It must be exhausting.

51:52.442 --> 51:53.568
Professor.

51:57.697 --> 52:00.534
It must've been tough
fixing your piece in such a short time.

52:01.034 --> 52:02.786
But it was worth it, wasn't it?

52:03.662 --> 52:05.914
Yes. I enjoyed it.

52:09.626 --> 52:12.796
I could feel that emotion in your piece.

52:12.879 --> 52:13.839
Good work.

52:16.383 --> 52:17.884
Thank you.

52:18.468 --> 52:21.304
Na-bi. You should go to Paris.

52:22.764 --> 52:25.851
Yes. I want to go there.

52:26.351 --> 52:29.437
Great. That's the spirit.

52:29.521 --> 52:31.398
It seems like you've spread your wings.

52:32.774 --> 52:34.526
There's no need to overthink it.

52:34.609 --> 52:37.195
Eat what you want,
and do what you want to do.

52:37.279 --> 52:38.530
Like the people you like.

52:38.613 --> 52:40.907
That's all you have to do.

52:43.034 --> 52:44.119
All right.

52:44.661 --> 52:46.955
SCULPTURE: YU NA-BI, YUN SOL,
KIM NA-YEON, YUN GEON-UNG

52:48.748 --> 52:50.542
You're taking everything down today?

52:50.625 --> 52:52.043
No, tomorrow.

52:52.794 --> 52:53.962
It's too bad.

52:55.714 --> 52:57.966
Why do you look so down, Na-bi?

52:58.049 --> 52:59.342
You even got praised.

53:00.468 --> 53:03.054
No, I'm fine.

53:04.139 --> 53:06.808
Come to think of it,
did Jae-eon come today?

53:08.852 --> 53:10.395
Jae-eon? Did he not come today?

53:10.478 --> 53:11.605
Did he come?

53:11.688 --> 53:14.107
-Hello.
-Hello.

53:14.190 --> 53:16.651
Sorry I'm late.
It took longer than I thought.

53:16.735 --> 53:19.070
It's fine. You're not late.
Thanks for coming.

53:19.154 --> 53:20.655
Thanks for inviting me.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.290
-I'll show you my piece.
-Okay.

53:30.373 --> 53:32.751
-I'll be back.
-Bye.

53:46.932 --> 53:48.266
What do you think?

53:48.350 --> 53:51.895
Gosh. It's just as I expected.

53:51.978 --> 53:52.979
It's great.

53:53.647 --> 53:55.023
I'm glad you think so.

53:55.607 --> 53:57.150
You're so cool, Na-bi.

53:57.901 --> 53:59.110
Stop it.

53:59.611 --> 54:01.321
Na-bi, let's go eat.

54:01.404 --> 54:03.990
Oh, it's been a long time!

54:04.074 --> 54:05.617
-Awesome.
-You're famous, you know.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.661
You're a superstar now.

54:07.744 --> 54:10.747
How much do you earn each month
with your channel?

54:10.830 --> 54:13.124
-I'm just curious.
-Can I be in one of your videos?

54:13.208 --> 54:15.335
-Me too.
-Why would you?

54:15.418 --> 54:16.670
That's ridiculous.

54:16.753 --> 54:18.338
Did you see that piece?

54:20.006 --> 54:22.467
-Hang on. Excuse me.
-Why?

54:22.550 --> 54:24.469
Can I join you next time?

54:57.210 --> 54:58.920
You like Jae-eon,

55:01.089 --> 55:02.173
right?

55:04.801 --> 55:05.885
I think so.

55:10.974 --> 55:12.392
But you were right.

55:15.020 --> 55:17.731
I know that he's not someone
who will make me happy.

55:25.363 --> 55:28.366
I know it's ridiculous
saying this right now,

55:29.034 --> 55:32.871
but I was really happy
spending time with you, Do-hyeok.

55:34.497 --> 55:35.540
Thank you.

55:38.168 --> 55:39.502
And I'm sorry.

55:41.046 --> 55:41.880
Na-bi.

55:47.343 --> 55:51.139
I'm glad I was able to feel these emotions
thanks to you.

55:52.640 --> 55:55.060
I'm grateful, so don't feel sorry.

56:07.322 --> 56:09.324
And please accept this.

56:20.794 --> 56:21.836
I'll get going.

56:35.141 --> 56:38.144
Min-yeong. Sorry I'm late.

56:41.356 --> 56:43.566
Your feet are all swollen.

56:43.650 --> 56:45.318
Here. Wear these.

56:49.697 --> 56:50.657
What?

56:52.283 --> 56:53.409
It's nothing.

56:54.702 --> 56:55.954
I'll do it.

56:57.831 --> 57:01.084
What? What is it?

57:03.670 --> 57:04.963
Did the interview go badly?

57:06.214 --> 57:07.132
I'm just…

57:08.258 --> 57:11.511
glad that you're here with me right now.

57:23.106 --> 57:25.525
Can I keep staying at your house?

57:29.362 --> 57:30.196
Sure.

57:37.537 --> 57:39.205
I feel so much better.

57:39.289 --> 57:41.791
My feet were aching all day.

57:41.875 --> 57:43.042
I bet.

57:43.877 --> 57:46.546
I'm hungry. Do you want to eat <i>tteokbokki</i>?

57:46.629 --> 57:47.672
Sure.

57:48.173 --> 57:49.591
Should we have some beer too?

57:49.674 --> 57:50.717
Why not?

57:52.510 --> 57:53.845
How was the interview?

57:54.429 --> 57:56.222
I don't know…

57:56.306 --> 57:58.558
I was so nervous that
I just blabbered nonsense.

57:58.641 --> 57:59.934
I can't even remember much.

58:00.018 --> 58:03.938
That's how people always feel
when they do interviews.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.106
Just forget about it.

58:05.773 --> 58:06.608
<i>Hey.</i>

58:06.691 --> 58:10.153
Which one of you liked the other first?

58:10.236 --> 58:12.113
Hey, Gyu-hyun! Was it you?

58:12.197 --> 58:15.033
Hey. The one who had feelings first

58:15.116 --> 58:18.077
and the one who confessed first,
none of that is important.

58:18.161 --> 58:21.039
If they like each other
and they're dating, then it's all fine.

58:21.122 --> 58:22.624
-That's right.
-Hey, listen.

58:22.707 --> 58:27.045
It's all about who likes the other more,
especially at the beginning.

58:27.128 --> 58:30.006
Se-hun, this is exactly why
you're not dating anyone.

58:30.089 --> 58:31.883
-Hey!
-Se-hun! You're so clueless.

58:31.966 --> 58:34.260
If you say that, then they can't answer.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.804
They'd be saying they like the other more.

58:36.888 --> 58:38.223
What's the problem?

58:38.765 --> 58:41.142
Shouldn't you like the other person more?

58:41.226 --> 58:43.520
Why would you date them
if you're not certain?

58:44.938 --> 58:46.022
That's a waste of time.

58:49.275 --> 58:50.610
Sol…

58:51.819 --> 58:53.112
Hey!

58:53.780 --> 58:56.699
So which one of you liked the other first?

58:58.660 --> 59:00.078
Well…

59:01.079 --> 59:02.247
I liked her first.

59:02.330 --> 59:03.331
What?

59:04.749 --> 59:07.710
Really? I thought it'd be Bit-na for sure.

59:07.794 --> 59:08.628
What?

59:09.212 --> 59:10.046
Since when?

59:12.382 --> 59:14.425
Since our workshop in our first year.

59:16.427 --> 59:17.512
No way.

59:17.595 --> 59:18.638
I can't believe it.

59:18.721 --> 59:20.932
Then it's been a really long time.

59:21.015 --> 59:25.186
Hang on.
You've been fooling us the whole time?

59:25.270 --> 59:27.272
You were just so clueless.

59:27.355 --> 59:29.524
Right, he's a bit clueless.

59:30.024 --> 59:33.278
If that's when you started liking me,

59:33.361 --> 59:35.113
then I liked you first.

59:36.447 --> 59:39.534
At our freshman orientation,

59:39.617 --> 59:41.869
I saw this hot guy from far away.

59:41.953 --> 59:43.788
As soon as I saw him,

59:43.871 --> 59:46.249
I knew I had to make him my boyfriend.

59:46.332 --> 59:48.585
Bit-na, stop lying.

59:48.668 --> 59:50.253
-Was it obvious?
-Yes.

59:50.795 --> 59:52.547
I was just kidding!

59:52.630 --> 59:55.383
Hey, Gyu-hyun.
Sorry, but can I have some of that?

59:55.466 --> 59:56.926
-I love you.
-I love you.

59:57.010 --> 59:57.844
Go ahead.

1:00:00.054 --> 1:00:01.723
I'd bring you the moon if you asked.

1:00:28.750 --> 1:00:30.168
I miss him.

1:01:23.179 --> 1:01:25.056
<i>I said I don't believe</i>

1:01:26.474 --> 1:01:29.227
<i>in fate or love anymore,</i>

1:01:31.312 --> 1:01:32.814
<i>but this…</i>

1:01:35.858 --> 1:01:37.318
<i>is too unrealistic.</i>

1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:44.010
What are you doing here?

1:02:47.096 --> 1:02:49.474
-Sorry.
-"Sorry"?

1:02:52.101 --> 1:02:54.854
-You're the worst. You know that?
-Na-bi.

1:02:54.937 --> 1:02:56.355
If you decided to be a jerk,

1:02:56.439 --> 1:02:58.858
you should've stayed that way.
Why are you here like this?

1:02:58.941 --> 1:03:00.443
What do you want from me?

1:03:19.170 --> 1:03:20.797
Do I still…

1:03:23.341 --> 1:03:24.759
have a chance with you?

1:03:24.842 --> 1:03:26.636
Were you going to cut ties with me then?

1:03:28.554 --> 1:03:32.183
I couldn't bear the fact
that you hated me so much.

1:03:32.266 --> 1:03:34.602
That's right. I hate you.

1:03:38.105 --> 1:03:39.565
I really hate you,

1:03:39.649 --> 1:03:42.985
and I know that you're a jerk
who toys with people's feelings.

1:03:51.869 --> 1:03:53.621
But I feel better now that I see you.

1:04:08.511 --> 1:04:10.680
So don't go anywhere and stay by my side.

1:04:18.813 --> 1:04:20.273
Why are you smiling?

1:04:21.816 --> 1:04:22.859
It's just that

1:04:23.359 --> 1:04:27.655
thinking about what to say to you
makes me smile.

1:04:28.447 --> 1:04:29.657
Do you like me that much?

1:04:30.616 --> 1:04:33.578
Yes. I like you a lot.

1:04:36.706 --> 1:04:37.957
Park Jae-eon.

1:04:38.583 --> 1:04:39.917
Let's go out.

1:04:42.879 --> 1:04:43.963
You won't regret it?

1:04:44.046 --> 1:04:47.383
Of course I will. It's obvious.

1:04:50.845 --> 1:04:52.388
But I'll still do it.

1:05:14.201 --> 1:05:15.244
<i>Love.</i>

1:05:17.705 --> 1:05:19.957
Why are you so hot, though? Are you sick?

1:05:20.041 --> 1:05:21.459
I'm fine.

1:05:22.043 --> 1:05:25.129
I don't feel sick at all
since you're here with me.

1:05:25.212 --> 1:05:28.090
<i>I know that it will cause me pain again.</i>

1:05:28.758 --> 1:05:30.426
<i>Nevertheless, I still…</i>

1:05:57.161 --> 1:06:02.249
EPISODE 10: NEVERTHELESS, I STILL…

1:06:05.795 --> 1:06:07.672
Do you have a girlfriend?

1:06:07.755 --> 1:06:09.674
-Can I have your number?
-Me too!

1:06:09.757 --> 1:06:10.883
My number?

1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:16.806
I have plans.

1:06:23.479 --> 1:06:24.939
-Did you get them?
-Yes.

1:06:28.985 --> 1:06:30.528
Should we eat something nice?

1:06:30.611 --> 1:06:31.654
Okay.

1:06:32.196 --> 1:06:33.447
What do you want?

1:06:34.281 --> 1:06:36.701
Well… What should we have?

1:06:37.284 --> 1:06:38.619
I'm not sure…

1:06:48.004 --> 1:06:50.214
-What is it?
-What?

1:06:52.425 --> 1:06:54.218
It's nothing. Let's go.

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:05.980
Then…

1:07:06.731 --> 1:07:08.899
should we go to the pasta place
you mentioned?

1:07:09.442 --> 1:07:10.276
Okay.

1:07:11.110 --> 1:07:13.029
Bit-na said it's good.

1:07:13.112 --> 1:07:14.155
All right.

1:07:15.114 --> 1:07:16.365
It's a cat.

1:07:18.576 --> 1:07:20.077
It's cute.

1:07:20.161 --> 1:07:23.330
I want a cat. Should we raise one?

1:07:23.414 --> 1:07:25.875
No. No more pets for you.

1:07:27.209 --> 1:07:28.294
Not even butterflies?

1:07:28.377 --> 1:07:29.211
<i>No.</i>

1:09:04.890 --> 1:09:09.562
