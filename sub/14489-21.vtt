00:21.981 --> 00:23.816
Good news, everyone!

00:27.946 --> 00:29.280
Well? What is it?

00:29.447 --> 00:30.532
What is what?

00:30.782 --> 00:33.368
Oh, right!
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:33.451 --> 00:37.789
We'll be delivering this
mysterious crate to Peebles Alpha.

00:37.872 --> 00:38.998
Peebles Alpha?

00:39.082 --> 00:41.501
The planet of gangs,
thugs and hustlers?

00:41.668 --> 00:43.294
Ooh! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

00:43.378 --> 00:46.047
Hang on. If we're delivering
a package to criminals,

00:46.130 --> 00:47.423
I want to know
what's in it.

00:47.507 --> 00:49.634
I have no idea,
Leela.

00:49.801 --> 00:52.387
But I'll tell you the
same thing they told me,

00:52.637 --> 00:54.472
"Stop asking questions,
old man,

00:54.556 --> 00:56.474
"and we'll slip you
an extra five grand

00:56.558 --> 00:59.102
"that your crew doesn't
need to know about."

00:59.477 --> 01:01.813
(GRUNTING)

01:02.105 --> 01:03.481
Now,
listen carefully.

01:03.690 --> 01:06.568
This planet is controlled
by two rival gangs,

01:06.693 --> 01:08.403
the Blips and the Cruds.

01:08.653 --> 01:12.407
You can tell them apart by
their colors, red and blue.

01:12.574 --> 01:14.617
Which gang's red,
and which gang's blue?

01:14.867 --> 01:15.952
Both!

01:16.327 --> 01:18.329
The delivery is
going to the Blips.

01:18.454 --> 01:22.166
So when you meet them, you'll
want to be wearing these jerseys.

01:22.417 --> 01:24.335
Not these jerseys.

01:24.419 --> 01:27.505
'Cause if you're wearing these,
you'll be killed on the spot.

01:27.672 --> 01:29.340
Okay, here are
yourjerseys.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.176
No, wait. Here.

01:32.969 --> 01:34.512
No. Wait...

01:42.687 --> 01:45.023
Does anyone else find
this delivery suspicious?

01:45.106 --> 01:47.275
Nope. He's too dumb
and I don't care.

01:48.026 --> 01:50.236
Well, I'm smart
and I care too much.

01:50.445 --> 01:52.196
I want to know
what's in that crate.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.781
But we're not
allowed to open it!

01:53.865 --> 01:56.534
I know that!
Go get me a crowbar.

01:56.701 --> 01:58.244
Please, use mine.

01:58.328 --> 02:00.288
I just need it
in case, uh...

02:00.580 --> 02:02.874
Fry gets his head
stuck in a pot of honey.

02:02.957 --> 02:05.710
And in the meantime, if
I should happen to bump

02:05.793 --> 02:07.587
into the crate
and open it...

02:07.670 --> 02:08.670
Whoopsie!

02:08.755 --> 02:09.756
(GRUNTING)

02:09.881 --> 02:13.134
Hey, Leela, Fry got his head
stuck in a pot of honey!

02:13.217 --> 02:14.802
Oh, bother.

02:14.886 --> 02:16.137

02:26.272 --> 02:27.398
Firearms!

02:27.523 --> 02:30.360
That's the one I was
secretly hoping for.

02:33.321 --> 02:36.699
I'm okay with most kinds of
violence, but not gang violence.

02:36.908 --> 02:38.493
Before we deliver
these weapons,

02:38.618 --> 02:41.579
we're going to disable them
so they can never be used.

02:42.038 --> 02:43.748

02:43.831 --> 02:45.041

Then pretend they're
little human necks.

02:47.126 --> 02:48.544
What? Let me at 'em!

02:48.628 --> 02:50.421

03:02.100 --> 03:04.227
A lot of ships get
stolen on this planet,

03:04.435 --> 03:07.105
<i>so, Bender, stay here
and stand guard.</i>

03:07.230 --> 03:09.816
Okay. I hope I never
see you again.

03:19.117 --> 03:21.953
Uh, I don't like the looks of
this gang-infested neighborhood.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.454
There might be spiders!

03:23.913 --> 03:25.331
We must have
made a wrong turn.

03:25.415 --> 03:27.333
We should have reached
Blip turf by now.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.460
You think we walked
straight out of Blipton?

03:29.669 --> 03:31.254
Wait,
there's some Blips.

They have the red on the left.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.677
Oh, no!
What should we do?

03:39.178 --> 03:42.473
(GASPS) Leela, this is no
time to show me your boobs!

03:42.640 --> 03:44.684

inside out.

We Cruds.

03:56.821 --> 03:59.157
Well, we Blips
and we over here.

04:01.451 --> 04:04.245
We put up that mirror 'cause
this is a blind intersection.

04:04.370 --> 04:07.165
It's considerably reduced
the number of accidents.

04:07.457 --> 04:09.625
It don't do nothing
for the murder rate, though.

04:09.834 --> 04:13.171

can blow your Crud brains out!

we were trying to guess

04:17.341 --> 04:19.343
what would happen if someone
stuck a gun in my face,

04:19.427 --> 04:21.262
and you said I'd
probably crap my pants?

04:21.721 --> 04:23.431
Well...
Excuse me, sir?

04:23.514 --> 04:25.850
We're not actually
Blips or Cruds.

04:26.017 --> 04:28.436
We're delivery people,
here to deliver this crate.

04:28.561 --> 04:32.440
So if everything seems to be in
order, we'll be on our way, a'ight?

04:32.607 --> 04:34.650
Oh, it's far
from a'ight.

It's a'ight, all right?

04:38.154 --> 04:40.281
It's a Crud and
he's got a gun!

04:42.909 --> 04:45.536
Yo, you just shot your own
reflection in the mirror.

04:45.661 --> 04:46.996
It was self-defense.

04:47.163 --> 04:49.540
We are the Cruds,
but we're over here.

04:49.749 --> 04:52.001
And don't shoot. That
crate is a gift from us.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.127
What?
Huh?

04:53.211 --> 04:54.295
For real?

04:54.378 --> 04:56.631
There's been enough
violence on these streets.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.091
Too many lives and mirrors
have been shattered.

04:59.258 --> 05:02.970
So, yo, we sent you a crate of
weapons as a sign of trust.

05:03.137 --> 05:06.849
Together, we can use them to rid
our streets of the real enemy,

05:06.933 --> 05:08.184

had a RoJack installed.

11:07.001 --> 11:09.044
(MUTTERING ANGRILY)

11:09.461 --> 11:13.174
Hmm. According to this, it
shipped out on a freighter

11:13.257 --> 11:14.925
from South Street Spaceport.

11:18.262 --> 11:22.141
Oh, yes, I remember that ass.
Let's see.

11:22.433 --> 11:25.895
Oh, God, no! It was on
board the Floatwell!

11:25.978 --> 11:29.607
(GASPS) The ship thatsankinthat
horrible space storm?

11:29.857 --> 11:33.444
Yes. I'm afraid your friend's
derriere is lost forever

11:33.527 --> 11:35.779
in the depths of
the Sargaseous Sea.

11:35.988 --> 11:39.033
My ass!
Sweet love of my life!

11:39.283 --> 11:42.745
Several hundred people died,
too, including my wife.

11:42.912 --> 11:44.997
My ass!

11:45.122 --> 11:47.958
I'm sorry, buddy. Maybe
we can get you a new one.

11:48.042 --> 11:49.126
Never!

11:49.376 --> 11:51.420
My ass is my soul mate.

11:51.629 --> 11:53.547
It even has its
own hind-brain.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.925
Really?
Your butt can think?

11:56.008 --> 11:57.843
No.
But it can feel.

11:58.052 --> 12:00.721
And right now,
it's hind-heartbroken!

12:00.971 --> 12:03.182
Just like me!
(SOBBING)

12:04.099 --> 12:08.187
Wow, Bender. This is really
important to you, isn't it?

12:08.270 --> 12:10.064
Uh-huh! (SNIFFLES)

12:10.147 --> 12:12.399
Okay, we're gonna
find that shipwreck

12:12.483 --> 12:14.735
and get you
your backside back.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.612
(WAILING)

12:16.695 --> 12:18.030
Okay, let's go.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.088
The ship carrying
Bender's heinie sank

12:34.171 --> 12:36.715
in the treacherous gases
of the Sargaseous Sea.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.050
Once we locate the wreck...

12:38.133 --> 12:40.511
(YELLS) Asteroids!

12:46.475 --> 12:48.352
Curse this interstellar fog.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.188
Why isn't there a lighthouse to
guide us away from the rocks?

12:51.355 --> 12:53.816
I don't know, but look
out for that lighthouse!

12:53.899 --> 12:55.276
(ALL SCREAM)

13:00.489 --> 13:01.865
(PANTING)

(GROANING)

13:05.202 --> 13:06.870
So you're alive,
are ye?

13:06.954 --> 13:10.624
Ughllsuppose you'll be wanting
to keep your tooth fillin's.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.042
Are ye hurt?

13:12.126 --> 13:14.545
No, but we could
use a hug.

13:15.421 --> 13:17.214
Better come inside then.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.885
Name's Tarquin.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.972
Been alone here, tending this
light longer'n I can remember.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.307
(BELL DINGS)

13:26.390 --> 13:28.058
That'll be my cup-a-soup.

13:28.225 --> 13:31.020
It's been microwavin'
longer'n I can remember.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.813
This is a dangerous coast.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.190
We didn't see your light
until it was too late.

13:35.274 --> 13:37.985
No beam can pierce
that devilish mist.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.653
Shipwrecks be so common,

13:39.737 --> 13:42.197
I make a good livin' out
of whatever washes ashore.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.742
Found me a whole
blue man group once.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.410
So you have two jobs?

13:46.577 --> 13:50.331
More. I also salvage the
wrecks with my bathysphere,

13:50.456 --> 13:54.126
and I'm a butcher,
if you like blue meat.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.962
Sounds good, but about
that bathysphere.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.173
We want to salvage
a cargo ship that sank

13:59.256 --> 14:00.758
carrying this
robot's rear end.

14:01.050 --> 14:04.511
Aye, I'll help ye
for a cut of the booty.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.306
Now, when you say
a out of the booty...

14:07.389 --> 14:10.225
I mean a percentage of the
value of the recovered goods.

14:10.434 --> 14:11.685
Now be gettin' some rest.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.479
The booty call
is at daybreak.

15:07.116 --> 15:08.784
(ALL SCREAM)

15:09.410 --> 15:11.829
<i>TARQUIN: Those sound like
one-eyed corpse screams.</i>

15:11.954 --> 15:14.498
Oh, how I wish I was
down there with ye.

15:14.832 --> 15:16.375
(DOOR OPENS)

15:17.584 --> 15:19.169
Let's not forget
that this shipwreck

15:19.336 --> 15:22.923
is also the final resting
place of this brave captain.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.134
Place your bets.
Wheel

15:34.518 --> 15:38.522
(GASPS) That's it, I'm sure. I can
tell by the words on the crate!

15:40.399 --> 15:43.652
Oh, my beloved.
You complete me.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.664
Hurry on inside now.
Storm's a-brewin'.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.624
I can feel it in my
weather channel app.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.001
(BUZZING)

16:01.545 --> 16:04.673
Soon the sea will be belchin'
her dead upon the shore.

16:04.882 --> 16:07.759
If you like your shoes unmatched
and with feet still in 'em,

16:07.843 --> 16:09.094
this is your night.

16:14.475 --> 16:16.226
Can't you make the
beacon any brighter?

16:16.435 --> 16:19.688
Nay, 'tis already the brightest
object in the known universe,

16:19.813 --> 16:23.525
and even so, it can't be seen three
feet away in a storm like this.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.117
I thought we were
near the rocks,

16:32.201 --> 16:33.452
but I don't see
the lighthouse,

16:33.535 --> 16:36.163
so everything is
fine and we can relax.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.917
<i>All hands on deck
for mojitos.</i>

16:40.375 --> 16:43.462
The important thing is,
I got my final piece back.

16:43.754 --> 16:47.257
Hey, Fry, take a picture of me
biting my own shiny metal ass.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.759
I'd be honored.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.728
Ah!

16:59.811 --> 17:01.897
You muddled the mint
well, Alejandro.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.612
Aye! The lighthouse! Dead ahead!

17:15.035 --> 17:17.287
Well, I'm sure
Bender's fanny is tired.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.540
As soon as this storm passes,
let's be on our way.

17:19.623 --> 17:20.624
(CRACKLING)

17:21.165 --> 17:24.836
Sargaseous lighthouse, this is the S.
S. <i>Miami</i> Muy Caliente.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.964
Thank you for
your glorious beacon.

17:27.256 --> 17:30.217
It saved our lives
and our Saturday night.

17:30.676 --> 17:31.718
<i>Adios.</i>

17:31.802 --> 17:33.679
(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING)

17:35.180 --> 17:36.390
Your aft-plate.

17:36.557 --> 17:39.726
Its fiery gleam saved a ship
full of South Beach swabbies.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.770
Well,
I do polish it every day,

17:41.979 --> 17:43.689
and I sleep in
a chamois diaper.

17:43.897 --> 17:47.276
It's 1 O0 times more reflective
than the mirror in my beacon.

17:47.568 --> 17:49.653
Might I keep it
for the lighthouse?

17:49.820 --> 17:51.154
What? No!

17:51.280 --> 17:54.199
But, Bender, your buttocks
could save lives.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.617
I hate lives!

17:55.784 --> 17:57.786
These are sailors' lives,
Benden

17:57.995 --> 18:01.456
Think of the untold cursing that
would be lost to future generations.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.417
Could you live with that?

18:05.836 --> 18:09.172
You know the answer,
you scurvy bastard!

18:10.173 --> 18:13.927
Maybe I have been selfish,
hiding my ass under a bushel.

18:14.428 --> 18:18.181
Perhaps, like all great
men, my ass has a destiny.

18:18.473 --> 18:21.810
And if it does,
I can't stand in its way.

19:00.432 --> 19:04.019
Bender, come join us.
We're watching Rear Window.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.897
I used to stick my
rear out the window.

19:07.230 --> 19:10.108
If you prefer, we could
watch Behind the <i>Music.</i>

19:10.359 --> 19:12.486
My behind used
to make music.

19:12.653 --> 19:14.071
<i>Backdraft is on.</i>

19:14.237 --> 19:15.947
Even my ass
wouldn't watch that.

19:16.573 --> 19:19.534
Bender, I'm proud of you
for the sacrifice you made.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.996
Try and find solace in the
fact that somewhere out there,

your keister is doing good.

But yer nights of endless,

Now what say I read you a nice
passage from the Scripture

19:43.475 --> 19:46.019
to help you forget
yer old master?

19:51.066 --> 19:55.320
"In the sanctuary, he made
