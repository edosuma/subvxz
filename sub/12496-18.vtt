- Your best? I just told you

16:21.125 --> 16:24.250
exactly where I'm hi--

16:28.542 --> 16:30.709
- Okay, I've re-set

16:28.542 --> 16:30.709
the time machine.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.959
Now let's bring

16:30.750 --> 16:32.959
Captain Man home.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.458
- Do it.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.208
- Oy!

With the lights!

16:46.792 --> 16:48.417
- Great Scott!

16:48.458 --> 16:49.542
- Uhhh... where are we?

16:49.583 --> 16:53.208
- I... I don't know.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.542
Quick, let's get outta here!

16:55.583 --> 16:58.500
- Whoa!

16:55.583 --> 16:58.500
This is heavy!

17:01.417 --> 17:03.041
- Let me try that again.

17:04.542 --> 17:07.542
- Ow!

17:04.542 --> 17:07.542
Dad, this bump really hurts!

- But, well don't squeeze it!

Ray, do you hear me?

17:36.375 --> 17:38.333
C'mon, answer me man! Ray!

17:38.375 --> 17:39.625
- Huh? What?

17:42.291 --> 17:43.458
- Henry.

17:45.458 --> 17:46.667
Forget about me.

17:46.709 --> 17:48.583
- No, no, no, no.

17:46.709 --> 17:48.583
We're gonna save you, man!

17:48.625 --> 17:51.250
- It's too late for me, kid.

17:51.291 --> 17:56.083
Just... remember how

17:51.291 --> 17:56.083
handsome I was.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.875
- You guys, look!

17:59.917 --> 18:03.250
It's nine degrees below zero

17:59.917 --> 18:03.250
in Alaska in 1709!

18:03.291 --> 18:05.458
Ray-- Ray can't last

18:03.291 --> 18:05.458
ten more minutes out there.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.083
What are we gonna do?

18:05.500 --> 18:08.083
- I don't know.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.959
- Hey!

18:10.000 --> 18:12.291
Schwoz can't make the machine

18:10.000 --> 18:12.291
bring Ray back here, right?

18:12.333 --> 18:13.542
- Right.

18:13.583 --> 18:16.917
- D'ah, sure, I designed

18:13.583 --> 18:16.917
and built every thing in

18:16.959 --> 18:18.875
the whole Man Cave,

18:18.917 --> 18:21.917
but let's all focus on

18:18.917 --> 18:21.917
one the thing I can't do!

18:21.959 --> 18:23.625
- Just listen!

18:23.667 --> 18:28.250
What if you open up the time

18:23.667 --> 18:28.250
portal to Prudhoe Bay in 1709,

18:28.291 --> 18:29.792
then one of us reaches in,

18:29.834 --> 18:34.458
grabs Ray and just

18:29.834 --> 18:34.458
yanks him back through?

18:34.500 --> 18:36.250
- Would it work?

18:36.291 --> 18:40.291
- Maybe-- if Ray is close enough

18:36.291 --> 18:40.291
for someone to reach him.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.125
But it's dangerous.

18:42.166 --> 18:45.750
- Hey! I gotta pee.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.792
I'll be back in an hour.

18:49.667 --> 18:51.250
- Why is it dangerous?

18:51.291 --> 18:53.500
- Because whoever goes

18:51.291 --> 18:53.500
through the portal

18:53.542 --> 18:56.333
must keep one part of

18:53.542 --> 18:56.333
their body on this side

18:56.375 --> 18:58.208
of the machine at all times.

18:58.250 --> 19:02.250
- Why? What happens if they

18:58.250 --> 19:02.250
go all the way through?

19:02.291 --> 19:04.041
- The portal will close

19:02.291 --> 19:04.041
and they could end up

19:04.083 --> 19:07.250
stuck in Alaska with Ray.

19:04.083 --> 19:07.250
- In 1709.

19:07.291 --> 19:09.792
- And we might not be able

19:07.291 --> 19:09.792
to bring them back.

19:09.834 --> 19:11.750
Ever.

19:09.834 --> 19:11.750
- Well...

19:11.792 --> 19:15.834
If one of us is gonna

19:11.792 --> 19:15.834
try this, it's gonna be me.

19:15.875 --> 19:18.125
- Well, duh.

19:15.875 --> 19:18.125
- You think I'd try it?
