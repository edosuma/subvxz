00:11.720 --> 00:14.399
Tonight, Raikkonen... Oops.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.119
Evans... Can't believe it.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.599
Slash...

00:18.600 --> 00:21.400
and bash, as we do
proper motor racing.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.919
Hello and welcome to the playground.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.279
Welcome, everybody. Thank you.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.640
Thank you so much.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.960
Now, we begin with the BMW M5.

00:44.440 --> 00:49.279
For the last 25 years, it has been
the best fast saloon.

00:49.280 --> 00:54.999
Erm, which is a bit of a problem
for BMW every time they replace it,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.840
as Richard Hammond
shall now explain.

01:04.040 --> 01:09.159
This is the outgoing M5 in action
and, straightaway,

01:09.160 --> 01:11.479
you can see the problem.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.919
It's brilliant.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.959
Big, 500 horsepower, V10 upfront,

01:17.960 --> 01:21.039
naturally aspirated,

01:21.040 --> 01:27.439
it's just distilled essence
of single-malt driving pleasure.

01:27.440 --> 01:32.279
And that gives BMW
a problem much like that faced
by the makers of Die Hard 4,

01:32.280 --> 01:35.399
or of Cheryl Cole's 2011 calendar.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.999
This is a personal analogy,
but it works for me.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.120
The problem is this...
where to go next?

01:43.560 --> 01:48.759
Well, this is where they've gone
the next. It's the brand-new M5.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.439
It costs £73,000 and, on paper,

01:52.440 --> 01:55.519
it sounds like a much tamer beast.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.359
For starters, the magnificent V10

01:58.360 --> 02:03.440
has been replaced
by a more polar bear-friendly V8.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.679
When you're driving along,
you can certainly hear it.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.239
But then you would
as it's fitted with a system

02:12.240 --> 02:13.999
piping a synthesised version

02:14.000 --> 02:16.680
of the exhaust note
through the stereo.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.400
That's kind of cheating, isn't it?

02:25.040 --> 02:29.199
Thanks to additions like the
seven-speed double-clutch gearbox,

02:29.200 --> 02:34.359
this new M5 now weighs
90 kilograms more than the old one.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.759
At first glance, then,
it seems like the M5's

02:37.760 --> 02:40.520
rock 'n' roll days are over.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.959
Oh, dear.

02:43.960 --> 02:47.319
I seem to have accidentally pulled up
alongside the old M5,

02:47.320 --> 02:50.079
for what looks
like the makings of a drag race.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.839
Yeah, there's a man in a white coat
and everything.

02:53.840 --> 02:59.279
Three, two, one, go!

02:59.280 --> 03:03.559
Oh, ho-ho ho! That's some power!

03:03.560 --> 03:06.639
Getting ahead.

03:06.640 --> 03:11.999
Yeah, this is probably a good time
to tell you more about that V8.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.039
It's got two turbos
which gives it 552 brake horsepower,

03:17.040 --> 03:18.999
52 more than the V10,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.999
and more torque.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.199
A lot more torque.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.000
And it's quick!

03:28.400 --> 03:30.719
Ya-hah-ha!

03:30.720 --> 03:33.199
Had you worried for a moment, then!

03:33.200 --> 03:36.519
More firepower in the engine bay

03:36.520 --> 03:39.039
is just the first piece of good news.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.639
In the old M5,
you got a techno-overload

03:42.640 --> 03:44.479
of 11 gearshift settings.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.879
In the new one,
it's a more sensible three.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.639
And, with that new
twin-clutch gearbox,

03:50.640 --> 03:53.639
the shifts are so fast,
the gap between them

03:53.640 --> 03:56.479
can't even be measured.
That's good,

03:56.480 --> 04:01.680
But it's not as good as the way
this car simply devours corners.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:12.560 --> 04:17.238
Unlike Porsche, with their new 911,
BMW has not gone for electric

04:17.240 --> 04:21.238
steering, but instead stuck
with old-fashioned hydraulics.

04:21.240 --> 04:25.679
And it's so much better for it.
There's much more of that feedback.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.039
It actually lets you know which way
the front wheels are pointing.

04:29.040 --> 04:33.560
With these settings in full track
mode, you can smoke all day long.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.679
And, when you've had enough of that,

04:40.680 --> 04:45.600
at the touch of a button, it becomes
a completely different car.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.879
The old one was always a bit,
you know, "Grr-argh",

04:50.880 --> 04:53.319
always straining at the leash.

04:53.320 --> 04:57.919
But this one,
it can be a proper lunatic M5.

04:57.920 --> 05:04.239
Or a soothing companion when you
just want to drive along the M5.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.039
See, the motorway? The M...

05:06.040 --> 05:08.999
It's also more economical.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.039
It has a bigger fuel tank
so it can go harder for longer,

05:13.040 --> 05:16.399
and then there's the ride.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.639
It's really, really good,
comfortable.

05:19.640 --> 05:23.159
There's no stupid
rock-hard run flat tyres.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.240
It feels better than
a normal five series.

05:27.640 --> 05:31.839
The new M5, then, is not only better
than the old one,

05:31.840 --> 05:33.999
I'd say that, as an all-rounder,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.079
it's actually the best car
in the world right now.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.920
And, in some ways,
it reminds me of this...

05:43.920 --> 05:45.400
The BMW M1.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.639
In 1984, BMW actually took
the engine out of that

05:50.640 --> 05:52.919
and put it in a five series

05:52.920 --> 05:56.959
and the original M5 was born.

05:56.960 --> 06:02.239
The point is the M1
was the first supercar

06:02.240 --> 06:06.639
that could also be civilised
in the real world.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.399
And that's what they've done here.

06:09.400 --> 06:13.080
Meet the new boss,
same as the old, old boss.

06:17.760 --> 06:21.159
I see what you did there.
It's a heck of a thing!

06:21.160 --> 06:26.279
I have to say, that car... I drove it
the other day... is epic.

06:26.280 --> 06:29.759
It is amazing. Phenomenal car.
You like the M5, as well,
don't you? Yep.

06:29.760 --> 06:34.839
The only problem with it
is that in the past,

06:34.840 --> 06:37.719
an M5 was worth it because it was

06:37.720 --> 06:41.519
so much better than an ordinary five
series but the normal five

06:41.520 --> 06:45.599
series now is so good, it's hard
to justify spending the extra.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.639
Well, you're quite right.
Have you driven the 530 diesel?

06:48.640 --> 06:50.559
It's stupendously good.

06:50.560 --> 06:56.119
And it's £30,000 less than an M5
and it's an almost
completely perfect car.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.879
Did you know that in the diesel,
if you're careful,

06:58.880 --> 07:02.399
you can go almost 1,000 miles
on one tank full of fuel.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.559
That's all you want. 1,000 miles.
God! How old are you two?

07:06.560 --> 07:10.479
Well, I haven't spent
the last 10 years being 38,
unlike some people I know.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.479
I like 38. It's a nice age.
I'm going to do it again this year.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.239
Hammond, we don't have time
to cut you in half

07:16.240 --> 07:19.399
to see how old you are
cos we've got a very busy show.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.959
We also don't have time, I'm afraid,
to show you The Stig going

07:22.960 --> 07:26.519
round in the M5 but we can tell you
he did it in a 1.29.2.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.839
Pouring with rain, meaningless time.

07:28.840 --> 07:31.479
So what we'll do is move on,
swiftly, and do the news.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.519
Yes. And we begin with this.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.319
If you drive a car without
a windscreen at 50 miles an hour,

07:37.320 --> 07:39.319
your face looks like this.

07:39.320 --> 07:43.039
We established this
very clearly, last week.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.320
Now, if you take the speed up to 80,
your face becomes this.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.679
So can you begin to imagine
what your face would look like

07:52.680 --> 07:54.479
if you were to drive one of these?

07:54.480 --> 07:57.559
Inside out, I should imagine.

07:57.560 --> 08:03.199
This is the 217mph concept at the
moment... Lamborghini Aventador J.

08:03.200 --> 08:07.719
Has no windscreen, has no roof,
and I can only imagine, Hammond,

08:07.720 --> 08:11.360
that if you were to drive that,
your face would end up like that.

08:15.080 --> 08:18.279
I don't know
why you're laughing, James,

08:18.280 --> 08:22.520
because I've done research. Have
you? Your face'd look like this.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.039
Let's move on.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.239
The government is holding
a big summit to try

08:29.240 --> 08:34.759
and find out how to prevent sat navs
accidentally steering people into
fields and canals and railways.

08:34.760 --> 08:39.239
Yeah, always reading about them.
Heard this discussed on the news
and one bloke had

08:39.240 --> 08:42.958
contacted them to say, "I was using
my sat nav, driving along in my car,

08:42.960 --> 08:47.920
"concentrating, when I drove down
a ramp, past a lifeboat
into the sea."

08:49.280 --> 08:51.959
Well, clearly,
you weren't concentrating

08:51.960 --> 08:54.399
because you drove into the sea.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.399
The government summit
just needs to say,

08:56.400 --> 08:59.959
"If you allow your sat nav
to steer you into a field,
or the sea, or a nun,

08:59.960 --> 09:02.679
"it's your fault because
you're a blithering idiot."

09:02.680 --> 09:06.679
Yes. You're so right. It cannot be
the sat nav's fault. It isn't.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.159
A friend of mine
lives in Knightsbridge,
in the middle of London,

09:10.160 --> 09:12.480
wanted to go and see Chelsea
play at Stamford Bridge,

09:12.481 --> 09:14.839
put Stamford Bridge into the sat nav

09:14.840 --> 09:19.399
and only realised
something was wrong while
going past Peterborough on the A1,

09:19.400 --> 09:23.999
on the way to the TOWN
of Stamford Bridge, rather
than the big football ground.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.359
How daft d'you to be to do that?
It's only a mile down the road.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.359
How thick do you have to be
to believe what the digital

09:32.360 --> 09:37.679
pretend woman on the dashboard says
over what you can actually see
out of the window?

09:37.680 --> 09:41.679
I mean, the sea, for example,
it's big, it's blue, the top of it

09:41.680 --> 09:45.319
wobbles around and isn't suitable
for motor vehicles.
Don't drive into it.

09:45.320 --> 09:49.639
Now, pay attention, everybody.
Are you Mario Balotelli
or Wayne Rooney?

09:49.640 --> 09:51.999
Or that ginger one... Paul Scholes.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.439
Does your downstairs lavatory
look like this?

09:55.440 --> 09:57.159
Nice.

09:57.160 --> 10:01.359
Anyway, if your downstairs loo
looks like this and you're
a premiership footballer...

10:01.360 --> 10:04.559
good news, because Bentley
has made a new 4x4.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.479
Here it is.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.759
Oww!

10:08.760 --> 10:12.639
It is just a concept at the moment
and it is hideous and disgusting!
Look at it.

10:12.640 --> 10:17.159
Did he step away from his design
and go, "Yes, that's exactly
what I wanted"?

10:17.160 --> 10:21.879
He must, at some point, said,
"Yeah, that's my days work done.
I'm going home."

10:21.880 --> 10:24.799
Does anybody here like that?

10:24.800 --> 10:27.559
What? Yes? Seriously?

10:27.560 --> 10:31.639
That's because you're sitting behind
the television and you can't see it.

10:31.640 --> 10:36.479
You see, it's not there.
It's here. Look. Seriously?

10:36.480 --> 10:40.119
Yeah, I like that. Do you have,
in your house, those pillars either

10:40.120 --> 10:44.439
side of the front door like a
clang-clang-clang when you hit it?
No, but I'd like them.

10:44.440 --> 10:49.799
Have you got two fake stone lions
on either side of the gates?
No, I'd like them as well.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.239
This is My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding
being played out

10:53.240 --> 10:57.400
right here, right now.
What's going on? And there's the car.

10:59.680 --> 11:03.239
The only way is Cheshire.
There you go.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.519
Moving it along, a couple of weeks
ago, there was a report

11:06.520 --> 11:11.279
that said the flashing blue lights
on police cars were too bright

11:11.280 --> 11:15.239
and causing accidents because they
disorientated motorists.
That's as may be.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.239
I have more of a beef
with police car sirens.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.759
Too loud. Eh? Massively too loud.

11:20.760 --> 11:25.679
I think I live in a police
siren testing area.

11:25.680 --> 11:29.159
Four o'clock every morning,
"Sarge, can I borrow the Astra

11:29.160 --> 11:32.239
"and make sure the siren works?"
"Go to Holland Park.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.399
"Bring the Fire Brigade, ambulance."

11:34.400 --> 11:39.359
Are you two seriously suggesting
that emergency sirens are too loud?

11:39.360 --> 11:42.279
They are. Yes. Definitely.
They have to be loud

11:42.280 --> 11:46.319
because they warn people
to get out of the way.
They need to hear it.

11:46.320 --> 11:50.159
The people in front, but you don't
need to know three miles away.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.359
You don't. For people in front,
it would be OK

11:52.360 --> 11:55.439
if they'd just had a little bell
that went ding-aling...

11:55.440 --> 11:57.920
What's the point of waking me up
in the middle...?

11:57.921 --> 12:00.719
I can't move my house
out of the ambulance's way.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.559
They're not using the siren... They
don't care about you at that time.

12:04.560 --> 12:09.639
They care about people in the way in
a traffic jam. "Get out of the way!
Wake up James May, doesn't matter."

12:09.640 --> 12:13.679
I'm becoming increasingly fed up
of the way you drive up to London,

12:13.680 --> 12:18.319
from your house in Wales,
tell us how to live
and then drive back again.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.639
We have to live there. Well, I don't
live there, but stay there,

12:21.640 --> 12:26.280
and it's noisy and it's stupid.
We don't come down and tell you lot
to stop hanging witches.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.959
I've just been passed this. At the
back, everybody, can you hear this?

12:33.960 --> 12:35.919
Yes.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.079
Clear as, quite literally, a bell.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.719
That's for starting playtime,
not sounding an emergency!

12:41.720 --> 12:43.879
He can hear it!
I'm in a burning building...

12:43.880 --> 12:46.679
I bet in Ross on Wye they do use it.

12:46.680 --> 12:51.319
I bet they have a cowbell and go,
"Dang-dan, Hammond's barn's on fire.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.639
"Send a child down the well.
Dan-dang."

12:53.640 --> 12:57.399
You get on with your thing.
Stop complaining others
are in the city with you.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.759
Ooh, now, next weekend,
Formula 1 returns

12:59.760 --> 13:02.359
and the big news is that
one of the old guard is back.

13:02.360 --> 13:08.120
But, before that he's here. Ladies
and gentlemen, Kimi Raikkonen!

13:12.560 --> 13:14.800
Mate, have a seat.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.959
So, there we go.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.120
Back in Formula 1.

13:23.520 --> 13:27.279
How does it feel?
How does it feel to be back?

13:27.280 --> 13:30.639
Very normal. I mean, the cars
are same. The people are the same.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.759
Same story.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.279
I just want to clear up,
you're racing for...

13:34.280 --> 13:38.639
because I'm a bit lost with Lotus...
you're racing for Lotus Renault?

13:38.640 --> 13:40.920
Er, yeah.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.279
That's what it says on there.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.639
Yeah, Lotus Renault
but there's another Lotus.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.959
You've got Lotus
that make cars in Turnipshire

13:51.960 --> 13:55.519
but that's got nothing
to do with this.

13:55.520 --> 14:01.519
No, I think the Lotus
is just the sponsor.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.279
So, is it a Renault?

14:03.280 --> 14:05.040
No, it's...

14:07.040 --> 14:09.879
You don't know
who you're racing for, do you?

14:09.880 --> 14:16.039
It's Renault factory built, so...
And you're sponsored by an
anti-dandruff product.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.800
Is that good? Seems to be working.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.320
Maybe you should try.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.879
Could be worse, could be Anusol.

14:27.880 --> 14:32.879
Now, I have to say, I sincerely hope
your return is successful.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.239
Really, genuinely, I do,

14:34.240 --> 14:38.439
because I love it when you're
in the post-race press conference

14:38.440 --> 14:40.840
and they ask those big, long,
convoluted questions,

14:40.841 --> 14:44.159
"So, in the third corner you came up
the outside, then you jinked left,

14:44.160 --> 14:48.359
"then right and then you went
on the inside, what happened?"
And you just go, "That."

14:48.360 --> 14:52.199
Yeah. I mean, you can make it
very complicated to answer

14:52.200 --> 14:55.279
but then you can also be straight

14:55.280 --> 15:00.279
and tell the true story,
so usually it's much more easier.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.599
Is it a Finnish thing
to be economical with words?

15:03.600 --> 15:07.759
I think there are
a lot of different people
in Finland, like they can tell

15:07.760 --> 15:12.679
the long way or the short way,
but for me it's easier
to say the short way.

15:12.680 --> 15:17.039
I've got some of
my favourite ones, actually.
There was the famous one

15:17.040 --> 15:22.159
when Michael Schumacher
got his lifetime achievement thing
in Brazil, from Pele,

15:22.160 --> 15:25.839
and Martin Brundle said,
"Did you see the ceremony?"
You said no because...

15:25.840 --> 15:27.680
I was busy.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.759
"Taking a dump," is what you said.

15:30.760 --> 15:35.159
I mean, I told the truth,
a true story, so...

15:35.160 --> 15:37.559
I fell off my chair laughing!

15:37.560 --> 15:41.799
I like this one. "The helmet has
a special meaning for many drivers.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.680
"How important is it to you?"
You said, "It protects my head."

15:48.160 --> 15:52.959
I quite like...
someone asked you, "What do you
think of the Abu Dhabi circuit?"

15:52.960 --> 15:55.319
Um...

15:55.320 --> 15:59.040
You said, "The first few turns are
good, but the rest of it is BLEEP."

16:00.400 --> 16:04.919
It's true the last part is not
very good. It's very twisty.

16:04.920 --> 16:10.159
It's catastrophically boring
to watch cars race round there,
from our point of view.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.359
I think it's many other circuits
also. It's not just that.

16:13.360 --> 16:16.319
No, there are a lot. You start
in Australia, don't you? Yeah.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.879
And that's next weekend. Yes.
How will you get on? Good?

16:19.880 --> 16:25.399
We hope. I mean, I don't know,
nobody knows where everybody is.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.679
It's a bit complicated to say from
testing, but we will see one week

16:29.680 --> 16:32.559
and, hopefully...
I think our car's not too bad.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.319
The car is not too bad?

16:34.320 --> 16:37.399
Yeah. Have you been hard at work
training to come back?

16:37.400 --> 16:41.119
Um, a little bit more time
than normal, but it should be OK.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.240
Have you given up drinking? No.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.999
Actually,
did you meet The Stig today? Yeah.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.879
Do you realise you're his hero?
Yeah? Did he say?

16:50.880 --> 16:54.879
He didn't speak a lot. I think
his work would be perfect for me.

16:54.880 --> 16:59.239
No need to speak,
just drive around in different cars.
You didn't speak to each other?

16:59.240 --> 17:00.999
A little bit.
He did speak to me.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.239
He said, "I've always really
liked Kimi Raikkonen,"

17:04.240 --> 17:06.519
and he met you once before.
Oh, yeah?

17:06.520 --> 17:09.598
Well, he wasn't drinking in a bar,
but he was in Monaco

17:09.599 --> 17:14.598
standing in a bar and then somebody
collapsed, drunk, on his feet.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.160
Yeah? It was me. Yeah.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.679
He looked down and went,
"Oh, it's my hero."

17:20.680 --> 17:24.239
Hopefully, he'll help me, then, huh?

17:24.240 --> 17:28.118
I've always wanted to check this
out. Before your very first race,

17:28.119 --> 17:31.839
your very first race, is it true
you were found in your motor home

17:31.840 --> 17:34.759
30 minutes before the race
fast asleep?

17:34.760 --> 17:37.199
Er, not in the motorhome.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.439
It was in Australia
so we had just small boxes there.

17:40.440 --> 17:44.559
But you were asleep? Yeah, under
the table. I found a nice place.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.319
It's normal.
I always sleep before the race.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.639
Usually there is a little bit
of time to relax. Really?

17:50.640 --> 17:53.359
Yeah. I like sleeping.

17:53.360 --> 18:00.159
Was it before the Ferrari race
that you entered a snowmobile race
in Finland?

18:00.160 --> 18:04.919
Yeah, I think it was 2007.
I've been a few times in the race.

18:04.920 --> 18:09.199
Do Ferrari let you do snowmobile
racing? I didn't really ask,
but I guess...

18:09.200 --> 18:14.599
You have a very strict contract,
but as long as you don't get hurt
too badly.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.639
Talking of which, show me your arm.

18:17.640 --> 18:20.359
No, undo your shirt. It's OK.
This is...

18:20.360 --> 18:23.039
What's that? It's a scar.
What from?

18:23.040 --> 18:27.559
Um... Some snowmobile, I think.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.119
And that was recent?

18:30.120 --> 18:33.599
Yeah, it was before Christmas
I hurt it a little bit

18:33.600 --> 18:37.280
but I had a good doctor to fix it.
Let's have a look.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.719
That is big. Did you break it?

18:40.720 --> 18:43.439
A little bit. A little bit broken?

18:43.440 --> 18:47.479
Anyway, obviously, you came
down here to try it. Yeah.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.880
I have to say the Suzuki Liana,
the Formula 1 car,

18:49.881 --> 18:52.639
the old reasonably priced car,
how was it?

18:52.640 --> 18:57.279
It was better than I expected, so...

18:57.280 --> 18:59.679
I mean, it wasn't too bad.

18:59.680 --> 19:04.639
It was quite wet so it was slippery
and I got a bit sideways a few times
but it was good fun.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.559
Who'd like to see Kimi out there
having fun in our Liana?

19:07.560 --> 19:10.800
- Yeah!
- Let's have a look. Here we go.

19:15.720 --> 19:20.599
Yep, that has begun. There was
a nice helicopter on our left.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.719
Well, I think you've covered
everything there.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.439
There you go. That's the line we
like to see from Formula 1 drivers,

19:27.440 --> 19:29.359
very wide.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.359
Oh, that's just
perfectly judged.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.760
Maybe it was luck.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.080
Oops.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.519
You see?

19:47.520 --> 19:50.919
You don't need any more than "oops",
although it is a surprise

19:50.920 --> 19:53.719
to see a Formula 1 driver
cocking up a gear change.

19:53.720 --> 19:57.399
Actually, you don't have to
change gear in Formula 1.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.519
It's much easier. It is.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.199
It's not a bad car
to drive in, then.

20:04.200 --> 20:09.919
You should be a road tester on Top
Gear. "And now back to the studio."

20:09.920 --> 20:12.559
We don't need to say
any more than that.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.999
Hammond rabbiting on earlier
about the M5. What's the point?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.519
Here we go, second-to-last corner.

20:19.520 --> 20:23.799
Unlike most of the guests, you held
it on the track, round Gambon

20:23.800 --> 20:26.200
and there we are, everyone,
across the line.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.040
Ho-ho!

20:34.360 --> 20:38.240
Now, these are the peeps from
Formula 1 who have tried it before.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.559
Sebastien, your badminton partner,
I understand.

20:41.560 --> 20:46.999
Yeah, at least I can beat him
in badminton. Can you beat him
in badminton? Yeah, every time.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.479
It's good to know someone can
beat him at something. Yeah.

20:50.480 --> 20:54.199
Our fastest wet lap is Lewis,
1.44.7.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.479
It's actually only
mildly moist. OK.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.959
Proper wet,
it's probably Jenson Button.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.559
No, it was Webber,
I've just been told.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.919
I hope I will be in top 10.
Top 10? Yeah.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.599
Somewhere there.
You're going to make it.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.319
That's my prediction.
I've got the time here.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.839
Kimi Raikkonen, you did it in...

21:15.840 --> 21:19.999
What was Webber?
The only really wet one? 1.47.1.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.080
You did it in...

21:23.120 --> 21:24.520
One...

21:25.920 --> 21:26.720
40...

21:28.520 --> 21:29.680
Six, one.

21:35.840 --> 21:41.519
Oh, I haven't put the W on.
I've got to put the W on.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.000
It looks better now. It does,
we'll remember that.

21:44.001 --> 21:46.399
Well, Kimi,
huge pleasure to have you here.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.279
Huge pleasure to have you
back in Formula 1.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.359
Very, very best of luck
with the season.

21:51.360 --> 21:54.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kimi Raikkonen!

22:00.880 --> 22:06.119
Now, you may remember that a while
back, Chris Evans out of Radio 2

22:06.120 --> 22:09.399
spent five and a half million
of his pounds

22:09.400 --> 22:13.479
on a very rare
Ferrari 250GT California Spyder,

22:13.480 --> 22:17.119
One of only 56 ever made.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.919
When I was a boy,
this was always my favourite
of the classic Ferraris.

22:20.920 --> 22:23.680
I've always wanted to drive one.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.919
This is Chris's garage,

22:28.920 --> 22:32.479
a place where his mostly white
collection of Ferraris,

22:32.480 --> 22:36.719
including an F40,
a Dino and a 288GTO,

22:36.720 --> 22:39.400
is pampered and entertained.

22:42.720 --> 22:46.599
Why did you choose white?
It's a big decision
once you've chosen white...

22:46.600 --> 22:48.719
They were all going to be
different colours

22:48.720 --> 22:51.198
but we couldn't figure
which colour to paint the Dino.

22:51.199 --> 22:53.120
So we said,
"Let's paint the Dino white."

22:53.121 --> 22:55.959
The Dino was the first finished,
it looked so good in white, we said,

22:55.960 --> 22:58.079
"What the hey!
Let's do them all white."

22:58.080 --> 23:01.679
'When I'd listened politely
for a well-mannered amount
of time...'

23:01.680 --> 23:05.759
It's got the nod to the GTO. Mm.
250 short wheelbase.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.639
'..I got to the real reason
for my visit.'

23:08.640 --> 23:10.920
Where's the California?

23:12.240 --> 23:15.279
It's over there. Can we see it?

23:15.280 --> 23:18.039
I must take my shoes off
to go through? Absolutely.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.399
Come on. Sort it out.

23:20.400 --> 23:23.840
I've never, ever been asked to take
my shoes off in a garage before.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.360
Oh, look at that!

23:27.640 --> 23:29.080
Oh, man!

23:31.440 --> 23:32.920
May I? Yeah, course.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.359
Oh! Ho-ho ho!

23:36.360 --> 23:37.840
Wow!

23:41.480 --> 23:42.720
Can I have a go?

23:42.721 --> 23:45.239
What do you mean?

23:45.240 --> 23:47.919
Huh? What do you mean?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.999
Can I... can I drive it?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.239
What, out of here? Yeah.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.319
It is me. If it was Pinky or Perky,

23:55.320 --> 23:58.559
I could understand your reticence,
but I'm a...

23:58.560 --> 24:03.239
Can't I? Chris, I've waited
all my life just to stand next
to one of these.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.880
I know it was expensive. Oh, God.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.120
But I won't ever get another chance.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.600
Take it out, be careful...
Of course.

24:17.880 --> 24:22.039
Avoid standing water. I do this
in my Fiat Panda. Yeah, I'm sure.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.439
You know, just be careful with it.

24:24.440 --> 24:27.599
Of course I'll be careful.
All right. Thank you. Yeah.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.039
I appreciate it.

24:29.040 --> 24:35.640
Before I set out, Chris insisted we
put the roof up, in case it rained.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.879
That doesn't really work, does it?

24:39.880 --> 24:44.720
Well, that doesn't work at all.
Oh, no! How much was it? Oh, God!

24:47.280 --> 24:52.999
With the roof abandoned, I set off
in one of the world's rarest cars,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.440
already starting to wish
that Chris had said no.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.999
Right, there is a car coming.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.479
It's a long way off, but this
could cut out, you never know.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.360
It's an old car,
so let's just hold back.

25:20.280 --> 25:23.720
Go, go, go!

25:26.320 --> 25:29.119
Right, I'm on real roads,
with real cars.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.519
Those people might be
trying to send a text.

25:31.520 --> 25:34.440
Those people over there
may have been drinking.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.319
This is a fantastic moment

25:37.320 --> 25:41.839
in my driving life,
but it is rather being spoiled

25:41.840 --> 25:44.759
by the thought of £5.6 million.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.759
It's a bit like being given
an original Rembrandt

25:47.760 --> 25:51.120
and then being told to take it
down the pub on Friday night.

25:52.520 --> 25:56.239
Now, I can't honestly say
I'm enjoying it.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.679
Don't reverse.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.840
Get off the phone.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.280
Oh, God! Not here.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.760
Oh, don't say you want
to go backwards.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.000
Steady, steady.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.919
Thank you.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.440
I think I'm going to get away.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.759
Yes, freedom!

26:30.760 --> 26:34.440
'And then things got
slightly worse.'

26:35.480 --> 26:39.279
Be careful of the car,
it's very valuable. Mind the car.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.879
Stay away from the car.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.759
'Those pesky kids
were the last straw,

26:43.760 --> 26:46.800
'so I went and hid,
in Windsor Park.'

26:49.440 --> 26:51.640
And... relax!

26:53.560 --> 26:56.719
Right, the Ferrari
250 GT California,

26:56.720 --> 26:58.920
what is all the fuss about?

27:01.120 --> 27:04.719
Well, besides the fact that
it's rare, the California has always

27:04.720 --> 27:07.919
been one of the most
desirable Ferraris, built to allow

27:07.920 --> 27:12.840
wealthy West Coast Americans
to soak up their sunshine.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.799
This car, for example, belonged
to the film star James Coburn,

27:17.800 --> 27:21.759
who kept it for 23 years.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.999
Coburn was one of Hollywood's
petrol-head elite,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.559
along with Steve McQueen.
In fact, it was Steve McQueen

27:28.560 --> 27:32.199
who persuaded Coburn to buy it
from a Belgian dealership

27:32.200 --> 27:35.560
while they were filming
The Great Escape together.

27:38.400 --> 27:42.279
The other reason this car
is part of automotive royalty

27:42.280 --> 27:45.720
is quite simply
because of its astonishing beauty.

27:49.280 --> 27:53.199
It was built by Ferrari's
favourite metalworker,

27:53.200 --> 27:57.199
Sergio Scalietti, who never
really bothered with drawings,

27:57.200 --> 28:01.639
but beat out the panels
using an artist's eye
and a craftsman's hand.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.039
That's why it's said

28:03.040 --> 28:07.720
that no two Californias
are exactly alike.

28:09.880 --> 28:13.319
But putting all the romance and
history to one side for a moment,

28:13.320 --> 28:15.120
what's this car like to drive?

28:16.080 --> 28:19.239
It's fantastic!

28:19.240 --> 28:22.920
Yes, it is! Come on!

28:27.280 --> 28:30.799
You can tell it's an old Ferrari.
The steering wheel is enormous.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.799
The driving position is ridiculous.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.839
The pedals are actually
over near that tree somewhere,

28:35.840 --> 28:40.040
but it's lovely.
It's so special.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.319
I can actually feel the wood
on the steering wheel

28:46.320 --> 28:49.639
flexing slightly
as we go over bumps.

28:49.640 --> 28:53.719
Its 3-litre V12
produces just 280 horsepower,

28:53.720 --> 28:57.359
and 0-60 takes around 8 seconds.

28:57.360 --> 29:01.559
Slow by modern Ferrari standards,
but that's not the point.

29:01.560 --> 29:05.639
Cars like this, the performance
is not about the figures.

29:05.640 --> 29:08.400
It's about the nature
of the delivery.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.360
You get it above about 3,500 rpm...

29:11.361 --> 29:14.320
I'll drop it down
so you can see what I mean.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.360
California!

29:27.200 --> 29:28.919
I don't want to get emotional,

29:28.920 --> 29:31.719
but this is the realisation
of a childhood dream.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.680
When I was seven or eight years old,

29:33.681 --> 29:36.799
I looked at pictures
of this car and I thought, "I wonder

29:36.800 --> 29:41.959
"if I will ever drive a Ferrari 250
GT California," and here I am.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.520
It's absolutely magical.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.880
I've met my hero,
and I'm not disappointed.

29:50.280 --> 29:54.120
Really, it was time
to give Chris's car back.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.959
But since he works
on a breakfast show,

29:57.960 --> 29:59.759
I reckoned he'd be in bed early

29:59.760 --> 30:03.480
and he wouldn't miss it
for a bit longer.

30:19.520 --> 30:23.200
It's close, I agree it's close,
but I still think it's that.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.399
I still can't believe
he let you drive that car.

30:27.400 --> 30:30.919
Well, why not? Because as we learned
from Monopoly, you are a liar

30:30.920 --> 30:32.239
and a cheat.

30:32.240 --> 30:37.039
You brought the bank down.
Yes, you are Sir Fred May.

30:37.040 --> 30:40.199
You should be made to hand back
that honorary doctorate.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.879
Now we know more about...
Hammond, we don't have time

30:42.880 --> 30:44.999
for any more arguing about Monopoly

30:45.000 --> 30:49.560
because I need a Slash, and luckily,
we've got one. He's over there!

30:54.440 --> 30:57.279
Look who's here.
How are you?

30:57.280 --> 30:58.919
I'm OK.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.519
Look at that!

31:00.520 --> 31:02.119
Really here!

31:02.120 --> 31:05.560
Have a seat. Have a seat.

31:07.680 --> 31:11.399
Now, I think a lot of people
would be surprised

31:11.400 --> 31:16.319
to discover that you grew up
in Stoke-on-Trent.

31:16.320 --> 31:20.079
Yeah. I was born in Hampstead,

31:20.080 --> 31:22.959
London, but lived in Stoke.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.399
Stoke gets a bad rap,
but it's a great place.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.399
I went back there and played there,

31:27.400 --> 31:29.879
did my first concert there,
just last year.

31:29.880 --> 31:33.319
This is with the new solo stuff?
Yeah, it was great. We had a blast.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.519
So you were in Los Angeles
by the age of...

31:35.520 --> 31:38.559
Six. Oh, so it was
a very short time in Stoke?

31:38.560 --> 31:44.199
Yeah. I am fascinated by one thing.
Your mum is an African-American.

31:44.200 --> 31:47.879
Uh-huh. She designs costumes
for the likes of... or did design...

31:47.880 --> 31:50.159
Joni Mitchell and David Bowie, yeah?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.959
Your dad did album covers

31:52.960 --> 31:55.479
for Neil Young, among others.
Uh-huh.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.079
Paint a picture,
with these parents like they were,

31:59.080 --> 32:01.319
of what it was like growing up
in Los Angeles?

32:01.320 --> 32:05.439
Basically, both my parents were
hippies, both involved in music.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.079
Everybody was an artist.

32:07.080 --> 32:12.039
It was just a very Bohemian,
very artistic, creative environment.

32:12.040 --> 32:15.039
In that neighbourhood,
there was Frank Zappa, Jim Morrison

32:15.040 --> 32:19.199
and the Eagles,
before they formed with Glenn Frey.

32:19.200 --> 32:23.559
We had to watch Top Of The Pops,
and you had them around
your breakfast table.

32:23.560 --> 32:26.519
That's deeply irritating to me.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.999
Can I just ask,

32:28.000 --> 32:31.439
did your mother do your outfits,
since she's a costume designer?

32:31.440 --> 32:35.479
Well, she did actually make me
one of the coolest pairs of leather
pants I ever had.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.079
Why do you always wear
leather trousers?

32:38.080 --> 32:41.679
I've always just thought that they
were cool-looking and, you know,

32:41.680 --> 32:43.839
you can get away
with not washing them

32:43.840 --> 32:45.240
for long periods of time!

32:46.520 --> 32:50.759
And the hat? What gave you the idea
to wear Brunel's hat?

32:50.760 --> 32:57.239
The hat came from when I was
in the early days of Guns N' Roses.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.120
I was walking around Melrose Avenue

32:59.121 --> 33:01.279
in Los Angeles,
looking for some clothes

33:01.280 --> 33:04.119
because we had a show that night.
I don't have any money,

33:04.120 --> 33:07.119
so I'm just wandering around
looking in windows and stuff,

33:07.120 --> 33:09.439
and for some reason,
I saw this in the window.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.119
So I went in there and looked at it
and tried it on

33:12.120 --> 33:15.519
and it felt really cool, so I walked
out of the store with it.

33:15.520 --> 33:19.279
I figured I'd just say
I forgot to pay for it or something.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.999
You stole the hat? Yeah.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.119
Then I went next door and
stole a concho belt and cut it up
and put it around the top.

33:25.120 --> 33:28.719
You do know this show is shown
in America? It's OK.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.279
It was long enough ago
that the statute's up by now.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.719
So you're going to get away
with the stolen hat.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.799
There's some gossip we didn't know.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.919
Slash wears stolen clothing.
And you've got
a new solo album out? Yeah.

33:39.920 --> 33:43.919
Is that it? Yeah, this is the
classic rock version of it.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.279
It comes with this thing
which is a fan pack

33:46.280 --> 33:50.359
and it's a magazine filled with
all kinds of stuff about myself
and the band.

33:50.360 --> 33:56.199
And that's the actual CD. And that's
called Apocalyptic Love? Right.

33:56.200 --> 34:00.399
It's a title of one of the songs,
and it's basically
a tongue-in-cheek thing

34:00.400 --> 34:04.800
about sexual relations
on the eve of the Apocalypse.

34:07.240 --> 34:10.760
Well, you'd like to get
one in before you...

34:14.719 --> 34:16.799
Er, now, obviously
you had a hard life

34:16.800 --> 34:20.918
in Guns N' Roses, I would imagine.
It was pretty edgy, yeah.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.080
But these days,

34:22.081 --> 34:28.360
am I right in thinking you're
completely clean and completely off
everything? For today, yeah.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.039
Have you still got
the snake collection?

34:32.040 --> 34:35.518
I have one snake now.
I used to have a vast collection,

34:35.520 --> 34:36.918
upwards of 90 snakes

34:36.920 --> 34:39.679
at any given time
for a long while there.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.159
And then just before London,

34:41.161 --> 34:45.719
my oldest son was born, because
they were all big constrictors

34:45.719 --> 34:49.679
upwards of ten foot,
I just had really cold feet

34:49.679 --> 34:53.918
that we should probably get rid
of all these snakes.
We're having a boy...

34:53.920 --> 34:57.119
Where's the baby? Yeah.
Which one of you...?

34:57.120 --> 34:58.679
That can happen.

34:58.680 --> 35:03.359
Now, I'm sorry for taking up
so much time talking about
your rock 'n' roll lifestyle,

35:03.360 --> 35:06.719
because I like that. But I know
you're here to talk about cars

35:06.720 --> 35:09.559
because you like them,
you'll all be relieved to hear.

35:09.560 --> 35:13.719
So what was your first car?

35:13.720 --> 35:19.319
My first car that I paid for with my
own money was a Honda CRX. No way!

35:19.320 --> 35:20.799
I had a Honda CRX. Yeah.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.719
It was fantastic. It was
a cool-looking little car,

35:23.720 --> 35:27.719
but eventually I gave it
to my brother,

35:27.720 --> 35:31.879
and then I got a 1966 427
Corvette coupe.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.479
The classic Corvette? Yeah, yeah.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.399
That's a bit of a leap
from a Honda CRX to a Corvette.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.479
It's a great car. I did a couple of
360s on Sunset with that car

35:40.480 --> 35:41.920
because it was so powerful.

35:41.921 --> 35:44.599
I didn't know what I was doing
when I first bought it.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.999
What have you got now?

35:46.000 --> 35:49.159
I have an Aston Martin.
That's my favourite car.

35:49.160 --> 35:52.679
Really? Ever since I was
a little kid, James Bond...

35:52.680 --> 35:55.959
But I could never afford one.
You look so similar! Right.

35:55.960 --> 36:00.839
When I got sober, my reward to
myself was to buy an Aston Martin.

36:00.840 --> 36:06.959
Which one did you get? I got
a Vanquish last year that they had.
Rotten gearbox, though. Yeah,

36:06.960 --> 36:10.719
but it was a cool car for a while.
I got a lot of tickets in that car.

36:10.720 --> 36:15.879
Then I traded that for the DBS,
which I had for a while.
But then I saw

36:15.880 --> 36:18.879
the V12 Vantage and thought,
"I got to have one of those",

36:18.880 --> 36:20.959
so I traded the DBS.
So you traded a DBS

36:20.960 --> 36:23.839
for a V12, and which do you think
is better?

36:23.840 --> 36:26.519
I have more fun in the V12 Vantage.

36:26.520 --> 36:32.519
Really? The Vantage
is just a little bit smaller
and because that engine's so big,

36:32.520 --> 36:35.919
it just makes it
that much scarier a car.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.999
So, your lap... how was it out there?

36:38.000 --> 36:41.119
It was actually pretty tricky
when I first got out.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.919
I mean, the way your track's
laid out,
it's like it's not really there.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.320
It's sort of made up.

36:49.440 --> 36:53.199
Are you sure you're sober? No,
I mean it's... It's the grey bit.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.519
Green, grey. I know, but it's got
all kinds of turns and stuff

36:56.520 --> 36:59.279
that are sort of pencilled in.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.079
Who would like to see Slash's lap?

37:02.080 --> 37:04.639
I would. Yeah!
Here it is.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.880
I was petrified.
Let's have a look.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.759
Look at that Kia go!

37:11.760 --> 37:14.319
Goddammit! BLEEP.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.039
You could just say "oops".

37:16.040 --> 37:20.039
We know that from Kimi. Ooh, I say!

37:20.040 --> 37:23.639
Now, that's stately. Silent.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.359
The wild man of rock.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.839
All right, brake on this one.

37:28.840 --> 37:33.920
Braking for Chicago and driving
round the corner in a brown car.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.759
Right, let's not BLEEP this up.

37:37.760 --> 37:42.559
Now, sometimes when a car looks
slow, it can be fast,

37:42.560 --> 37:45.479
but I've got a sneaking suspicion

37:45.480 --> 37:49.199
that this looks slow
because it sort of is.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.320
Pretty slow.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.359
This guy's got a lot of balls.

37:55.360 --> 37:59.279
I think you're referring to our
cameraman who just stands there.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.999
He does, yeah.
I know, he does it everywhere.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.639
Somebody'll get him one day.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.680
Right, how are we doing there?

38:07.760 --> 38:10.879
Oop! Yeah, braking. This is the
hardest part of the track.

38:10.880 --> 38:14.319
Very hard, but at that speed,
it's not as hard as you might think.

38:14.320 --> 38:15.480
When I did it faster,

38:15.481 --> 38:19.520
I ended up all the way on the grass.

38:28.280 --> 38:33.959
This is the board. Bearing in mind
it's raining out, so it's wet,
mostly the wets are down here.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.879
Where do you think?
I don't know.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.399
You tell me. Oh, I'm going to.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.679
I'm not guessing.
You're leaning forward.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.919
It's always a sign.
It's been an interesting day.

38:42.920 --> 38:46.279
I'm dying to see
what the result of all that was.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.399
Mr Slash,

38:47.400 --> 38:49.639
you did it

38:49.640 --> 38:53.360
in... one...

38:55.840 --> 39:00.520
49.8.

39:09.640 --> 39:14.719
It's along with will.i.am
and Peta 23 from Essex,
who you probably don't know.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.759
But I was faster than
Angelina Jolie, so that's good.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.920
That's not actually Angelina Jolie.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.919
Is that Alice Cooper down there?

39:23.920 --> 39:26.399
Yeah,
you're faster than Alice Cooper.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.759
He is the only real rock
guy on there.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.559
It's that rock 'n' roll thing.
Perhaps it's all blurry.

39:31.560 --> 39:32.720
Who knows? Anyway,

39:32.721 --> 39:38.399
ladies and gentlemen, it has been an
enormous pleasure to have you here.
Thank you so much for coming. Slash!

39:38.400 --> 39:41.960
Thank you very much.

39:47.760 --> 39:52.239
Was that you driving that car?
Might have been. Oh, come on.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.799
It looked like it. Now, moving on,

39:54.800 --> 39:57.719
and we move on, surprisingly,
to golf.

39:57.720 --> 40:02.919
It is very popular. There are 4
million golfers in the UK alone.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.639
Yeah, that is almost 8%
of the adult population

40:05.640 --> 40:09.639
and we can't really understand this
because, as far as we can make out,

40:09.640 --> 40:11.199
golf is extremely boring.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.359
It is also ruinously expensive.
A decent set of bats

40:14.360 --> 40:18.479
is going to set you back £1,000.
We rang a golf club

40:18.480 --> 40:20.519
in High Wycombe the other day,

40:20.520 --> 40:24.319
not Wentworth, and annual membership
there is £1,000.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.839
It's two grand before
you even start. Then you have

40:26.840 --> 40:31.079
the stupid jumpers and shoes, and the
Rupert the Bear trousers. It adds up.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.839
Then there's the cost
of joining the Freemasons.

40:33.840 --> 40:40.119
Exactly. So we were wondering,
could you do motor racing for less?

40:40.120 --> 40:45.679
We tend to think of motor racing
as catastrophically expensive,
but is that necessarily the case?

40:45.680 --> 40:49.239
We decided to find out.
We each bought a set of wheels,

40:49.240 --> 40:51.919
converted them into racers
as cheaply as possible

40:51.920 --> 40:54.480
and met up at the Lydden Hill
race track in Kent.

40:56.560 --> 40:59.399
Race day dawned,
and Richard and I were there

40:59.400 --> 41:02.319
good and early with the cars
we bought.

41:02.320 --> 41:08.199
This is a 150mph BMW 328I,

41:08.200 --> 41:13.239
for which I paid £795. Nice.

41:13.240 --> 41:18.959
It looks good. And you paid what
for this? This is a Citroen Saxo VTS
1.6, for which I paid

41:18.960 --> 41:22.799
£550, and it's a nice one.
It is a nice one.

41:22.800 --> 41:26.279
That is in really good nick.
It's a hot little car.

41:26.280 --> 41:30.519
'Then James arrived
in a Toyota MR2.'

41:30.520 --> 41:32.639
That is a surprise.

41:32.640 --> 41:36.479
That is an unexpected car.
I thought he'd been lost on the A35.

41:36.480 --> 41:40.879
Morning. May! How much was that?

41:40.880 --> 41:41.919
£450.

41:41.920 --> 41:44.079
Seriously? 450 quid? Yep.

41:44.080 --> 41:46.599
So we've got mid-engined,
rear drive,

41:46.600 --> 41:51.319
front-engined, front drive,
rear drive, front engine.

41:51.320 --> 41:53.679
That's a 328. I know.
But have you seen this?

41:53.680 --> 41:57.879
It's brilliant, this. I have to say
it, and I wouldn't normally say it,
obviously,

41:57.880 --> 42:00.239
but your cars look terrific.
Hammond?

42:00.240 --> 42:02.759
Yes. Blood type? Yes. "Red".

42:02.760 --> 42:05.559
Well, it is. It's red. I've checked.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.119
Stuck a pin in it. B?

42:07.120 --> 42:10.119
B-. I don't know what I am.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.519
That's an exam result!
I just made it up.

42:12.520 --> 42:15.439
It's what I'm used to seeing on
forms. I wasn't sure,

42:15.440 --> 42:18.799
so I put AB+. That way I'll get the
lot, so one of them will be right.

42:18.800 --> 42:22.959
As you can see, obviously,
I've put stickers on mine.

42:22.960 --> 42:26.239
Yeah, where did... Well, it's the BBC
and you have to have stickers

42:26.240 --> 42:30.879
on a racing car. "Fragile roof"?
I know, but the BBC
doesn't allow brand names,

42:30.880 --> 42:34.759
so I put health and safety notices
on it, as that's what the BBC likes.

42:34.760 --> 42:40.359
We should explain at this point
that there are certain safety
requirements you have to fulfil

42:40.360 --> 42:42.039
before you go motor racing.

42:42.040 --> 42:43.559
You have to put a roll cage,

42:43.560 --> 42:45.359
proper seat, harness,

42:45.360 --> 42:48.719
electrical cut-off fire
extinguisher, and the total cost

42:48.720 --> 42:52.599
of doing that on mine was around
£1,000.

42:52.600 --> 42:57.679
Yours was a bit less. A bit less
cos there's less roll cage in it
so it brings it up to 1,400 quid

42:57.680 --> 43:00.119
for the lot. And yours is? 1,430.
So, 1,400,

43:00.120 --> 43:03.439
1,400, 1,800 all in.

43:03.440 --> 43:06.399
So, for the price of a bag
full of golf bats,

43:06.400 --> 43:08.679
we were ready to go motor racing,

43:08.680 --> 43:11.400
and the motor racing we'd selected
was rallycross.

43:15.520 --> 43:18.599
The beauty of this
is that half the track is tarmac

43:18.600 --> 43:20.279
and half is gravel and mud.

43:20.280 --> 43:24.599
Oh, my good... Oh,
gosh, I don't know what's happened!

43:24.600 --> 43:27.519
So, you get to do high-speed
circuit driving

43:27.520 --> 43:31.839
and slidey rally stuff
all in the same race.

43:31.840 --> 43:34.199
Do you know,
I used to love rallycross.

43:34.200 --> 43:38.399
Yeah. Grandstand, World Of Sport,
you had Dickie Davies and he'd go,

43:38.400 --> 43:42.559
"This afternoon, we've got
fly-fishing, athletics and golf."
You'd go, "Oh, no."

43:42.560 --> 43:46.119
Then, "And rallycross." Yeah.
And you had those tiny televisions,

43:46.120 --> 43:50.239
the black-and-white screen
you were watching on. You
might have done in Birmingham.

43:50.240 --> 43:54.599
Look at that! I know. But then he's
got some actual track to do it on.

43:54.600 --> 43:57.199
Or he could be standing with
a Pringle jumper on,

43:57.200 --> 43:59.839
going like this...
Waiting for the man in front.

43:59.840 --> 44:02.319
Yes. Do you know the best thing
about this?

44:02.320 --> 44:04.999
It's really simple.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.199
When we got
to the driver's briefing, however,

44:08.200 --> 44:11.959
I realised I'd spoken too soon.
OK, there's 18 of you,

44:11.960 --> 44:17.999
so when you do your heats, if you
finish first, you get one point.
We've got three sets of races,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.919
so there'll be three people with one
point, three people with two points,

44:21.920 --> 44:25.279
three people with three points.
If you come seventh twice,

44:25.280 --> 44:30.439
that gets 14 but you only end up
seventh. You get seven points.
Why does it say 1 + 2 = 2?

44:30.440 --> 44:32.759
Well, you only pick the best one.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.119
If we were doing three,

44:34.120 --> 44:37.839
we'd pick the best two. Three what?
Three of your points from the heats.

44:37.840 --> 44:42.439
Eh? Happily, Captain Maths
was on hand to explain

44:42.440 --> 44:47.559
that, in short, we'd all take part
in two heats and at least one final.

44:47.560 --> 44:50.719
And, with that sorted,
we got to know the other drivers.

44:50.720 --> 44:54.120
I notice from the entry sheet
you're all called Gary.

44:56.120 --> 44:57.400
I'm not!

44:59.400 --> 45:04.999
Do you mind if I call you Gary,
just to keep everything clear? No,
that's fine. Just keep it simple.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.919
OK, but who is called Gary?
You're Gary, you're Gary
and you're both in my class?

45:08.920 --> 45:13.880
You are racing in Gary class...
so you are Gary Clarkson.

45:16.760 --> 45:19.959
I, meanwhile, was in the
modified two-litre class

45:19.960 --> 45:21.400
and our heat was first.

45:22.960 --> 45:27.999
I've got to do three laps.
That's all. Three laps
and try not to mess it up.

45:28.000 --> 45:31.079
Oh, look, we're getting lined up.
This is the grid. This is it!

45:31.080 --> 45:32.520
Go!

45:33.560 --> 45:35.840
Oh, we're off.

45:37.160 --> 45:40.520
He is overtaking!
Oh, my God, he's about second!

45:45.040 --> 45:46.879
He's not... He's third. Third!

45:46.880 --> 45:49.240
This is good. This is good.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.000
Now I'll have him!

45:54.680 --> 45:57.719
Come on, come on!
Ohh, this is exciting!

45:57.720 --> 46:00.639
Oh, he's gone to second!
He's overtaken... No, he hasn't.

46:00.640 --> 46:04.319
But this is genuinely exciting racing
with James May in it!

46:04.320 --> 46:08.439
And remember,
this costs less than golf.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.799
This bloke's all over my chuff!

46:10.800 --> 46:12.520
Right, watch this!

46:14.120 --> 46:16.720
Oh, no! No, I've got it back.

46:18.680 --> 46:20.920
No... Oh, he's lost it.

46:22.360 --> 46:25.119
I've broken something. Sod it!

46:25.120 --> 46:29.279
We... must... not... laugh... No.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.960
When he gets back.

46:33.080 --> 46:39.999
How bad is it? I suppose it's just
at the wings on the wheel.
Has the suspension collapsed?

46:40.000 --> 46:45.679
Every time I braked, it veered off.
Do you know that, momentarily, you
were in second place? I know.

46:45.680 --> 46:47.360
It was extremely exciting.

46:48.840 --> 46:53.159
Next up in the stock hatch class was
Professor Richard Hammond,

46:53.160 --> 46:56.359
who was still trying to get
to grips with the scoring system.

46:56.360 --> 47:02.399
Six plus one equals one,
because that's the result
they carry forwards...

47:02.400 --> 47:07.319
which means I could end up
in final C, which... C comes before A.

47:07.320 --> 47:10.880
I'm just going to drive around
as fast as I can.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.119
Oh, he's going to...
Not bad, not bad!

47:19.120 --> 47:21.360
It's a blinding start from Hammond!

47:24.440 --> 47:25.879
I love the rough stuff!

47:25.880 --> 47:30.279
The agile front-drive Citroen was
brilliant in the mud.

47:30.280 --> 47:32.319
Yeah, ha-ha!

47:32.320 --> 47:35.200
But I could have done with a bit more
power on the tarmac.

47:36.840 --> 47:40.879
I haven't quite got the legs on
this one up to the top. Might have...

47:40.880 --> 47:43.399
I braked myself into that quite hard.

47:43.400 --> 47:48.479
He might have done it... No,
he won't do it, unless he can get
a lot of speed down the hill.

47:48.480 --> 47:52.279
Oh, this is an epic battle
for third place.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.519
Oh-ho!

47:54.520 --> 47:59.239
Oh, wait, he's through. He's done
a move. He's overtaken somebody!

47:59.240 --> 48:03.000
Oh, this is exciting.
It's too exciting even to speak!

48:08.560 --> 48:11.120
Oh-oh, that was a punt!

48:12.280 --> 48:15.919
Could be playing golf, remember.
Could be playing golf.

48:15.920 --> 48:18.919
He's not going to come third.
That would be impossible.

48:18.920 --> 48:22.160
Come on. Come on!

48:25.040 --> 48:28.919
Yeah, ha!
Third place, that'll do me. Come on!

48:28.920 --> 48:32.119
Has anybody ever left a golf course
feeling this high?

48:32.120 --> 48:34.239
Woo-hoo!

48:34.240 --> 48:39.119
High-five! Hammond, that was
absolutely rostrum or hospital.
I loved it.

48:39.120 --> 48:42.599
So, third? That's exciting,
yeah. It's great!

48:42.600 --> 48:45.119
It was now my turn
and I was a bit nervous

48:45.120 --> 48:47.959
because the big engine in my BM

48:47.960 --> 48:51.039
meant I was in the
top super-modified class,

48:51.040 --> 48:54.159
where three of the Garys were
former champions.

48:54.160 --> 48:59.719
Ha-ha! Loneliest man in the world!
Get in there and be alone.

48:59.720 --> 49:04.439
Maybe I should go and play golf.
No. No, because we need to see
what golf is like in comparison.

49:04.440 --> 49:09.839
No, we need to prove our point,
which means you have to
drive that against these people.

49:09.840 --> 49:17.079
Crack on, Clarkson. Go on. Kindly,
James spent a few moments asking
the other drivers to be nice to me.

49:17.080 --> 49:20.959
Don't be nice to him, OK. I'm not
going to be. Just muller him.

49:20.960 --> 49:23.080
Top man.

49:24.320 --> 49:26.880
And then it was time for action.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.080
Five seconds...

49:37.800 --> 49:39.240
Oh, they're good.

49:41.160 --> 49:43.879
Unbelievably, though, I started to
make up places.

49:43.880 --> 49:45.879
Ooh, he's third, he's third!

49:45.880 --> 49:50.279
He's going to be third if he
can out-drag that one, and he is!

49:50.280 --> 49:52.280
Come on, Gary!

49:53.360 --> 49:55.560
Gary, I'm going to get you!

49:57.800 --> 50:02.360
I've got Gary up my chuff here
and I'm trying to take Gary
on the inside.

50:04.480 --> 50:07.240
Then the super-modified Garys
put me in my place.

50:08.800 --> 50:11.040
Ohh! Heavens, that was a big shunt.

50:13.560 --> 50:16.000
I may be off the track
slightly here.

50:23.240 --> 50:27.800
Spurred on by the support of my
colleagues, I chased after the pack.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.559
Right, come on, Jeremy, concentrate.
Let's go get 'em!

50:33.560 --> 50:37.400
But before I could catch up,
the race was over.

50:38.560 --> 50:41.880
That was brilliant, and I was last!

50:43.280 --> 50:47.759
Some of you will probably be
thinking, "I'd like to do that,
but what about safety?"

50:47.760 --> 50:53.439
Well, the number of people killed
last year in rallycross was nought.

50:53.440 --> 50:56.719
The number of people
killed on the golf course was...

50:56.720 --> 51:00.360
Well, nobody knows,
but it's many, many people.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.160
God, that was good fun!

51:05.920 --> 51:09.199
And the fun continued for the
rest of the afternoon.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.639
Loads of short, hard, fast action.

51:11.640 --> 51:14.839
And the racing was epic!

51:14.840 --> 51:18.439
Oh, look at that manoeuvre by the
Mini! That's Gary the girl.

51:18.440 --> 51:21.520
Gary the girl going
round the outside.

51:22.960 --> 51:26.239
Ooh, Gary's off the track. Come on,
this is good.

51:26.240 --> 51:30.399
Oh, it's absolutely wheel-to-wheel
stuff. Spectacular racing.

51:30.400 --> 51:35.919
Gary the girl! I've never
seen a race where two people are
side by side all the time.

51:35.920 --> 51:37.479
Yeah!

51:37.480 --> 51:41.359
In his second race,
Richard got another third,

51:41.360 --> 51:43.400
despite a bit of a moment...

51:46.320 --> 51:50.120
whereas, in HIS next heat,
Jeremy improved massively.

51:51.120 --> 51:54.599
I'm not last! I'm not last!

51:54.600 --> 51:57.599
I'm second to last.

51:57.600 --> 52:02.120
Then it was my turn, and they put
my hastily repaired car on pole.

52:03.640 --> 52:05.640
I'm ready.

52:07.880 --> 52:11.359
What a start.
He's into the lead!

52:11.360 --> 52:15.440
James May is... there's no other
word for it... winning!

52:18.440 --> 52:20.160
Oh, he's gone off, look.

52:22.800 --> 52:26.840
Right, now I've got
some racing to do.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.400
Cock!

52:31.440 --> 52:36.079
Three completely blind laps later,
I finished last, again,

52:36.080 --> 52:38.959
with yet another wound on my MR2.

52:38.960 --> 52:42.560
Oh, yeah! Oh, mate!

52:44.600 --> 52:47.879
With the points from the heats all
added up, we learned that Richard,

52:47.880 --> 52:51.599
with his two third places,
had qualified for the B-class final,

52:51.600 --> 52:55.120
whereas, James and I were in
the final for losers.

52:56.440 --> 53:00.919
That means you and I get to
race each other, then. Yeah, I know.
Yeah, but it's...

53:00.920 --> 53:04.079
If you stop and think
about the scoring system here,

53:04.080 --> 53:07.839
it's clever because it means
you will always end up in a final,

53:07.840 --> 53:10.280
irrespective of how rubbish you are.

53:13.280 --> 53:15.879
The final for losers went well.

53:15.880 --> 53:18.360
James got up to third
and stayed there.

53:20.200 --> 53:23.320
That was terrific! Did you see that?
Did you see me all over him?

53:24.600 --> 53:27.279
And as for the orang-utan...

53:27.280 --> 53:31.240
Jeremy, you're winning! You're
actually winning something!

53:32.360 --> 53:37.679
Miracles have happened here,
ladies and gentlemen, today.
I have actually won a thing!

53:37.680 --> 53:41.520
The victory gave me
a chance to wear my winning face.

53:44.080 --> 53:46.719
And there was another bonus as well.

53:46.720 --> 53:53.199
What are you doing here? Because I
won the spanner final,
I'm allowed to go into this final.

53:53.200 --> 53:55.399
This is my final. I don't understand.

53:55.400 --> 54:01.079
We established in practice you're
fast around here because you're used
to driving on wet leaves and mud.

54:01.080 --> 54:03.400
Because I live in Wales. Exactly.

54:06.720 --> 54:11.119
Right now I could be, I don't know,
chatting to my caddy,

54:11.120 --> 54:13.199
adjusting the tassels on my loafers,

54:13.200 --> 54:19.119
instead of which, I'm sitting here
at the wheel of my race car,
waiting to start.

54:19.120 --> 54:21.559
This is just so much better.

54:21.560 --> 54:26.239
What if I spoil Hammond's race
in some way?
I mean, I mustn't and I won't.

54:26.240 --> 54:28.799
I'm going to stay at the back,
not get in anyone's way.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.279
I shouldn't be here.

54:30.280 --> 54:33.080
Right, five seconds...

54:38.640 --> 54:42.800
That was a good start for me. That
puts me right amongst the big boys.

54:44.560 --> 54:47.280
Bad start. Really bad start.

54:55.600 --> 54:58.919
Come on, Gary, out the way.

54:58.920 --> 55:01.559
Whoa, he's got me on the grass!

55:01.560 --> 55:04.920
God, this Fiesta is really
aggressive.

55:09.480 --> 55:14.399
Oh, no, look who's there.
It's Richard Hammond, is what it is.

55:14.400 --> 55:18.839
How did Jeremy make up
that many places in MY final?

55:18.840 --> 55:21.760
I decided not to spoil
his big race...

55:23.440 --> 55:25.040
then I decided I would.

55:26.120 --> 55:29.440
Yeah, come on! Oh, yes!

55:34.280 --> 55:37.120
Come on, Beemer! Come on now!

55:38.240 --> 55:40.440
Oh, he's left me a gap.

55:42.800 --> 55:45.679
No, I've gone wide!

55:45.680 --> 55:48.120
Ooh, that was a biggie!

55:49.960 --> 55:53.360
There was now just one lap left
to take Hammond.

55:59.920 --> 56:01.960
Lot more traction here, sunshine.

56:04.040 --> 56:06.519
Coming up the inside of you.

56:06.520 --> 56:08.480
There you go.

56:13.720 --> 56:16.720
Come on! Clarkson's right behind me.

56:18.960 --> 56:22.040
Come on now!

56:25.040 --> 56:29.479
BMW on my inside.
This is where he's got the power.

56:29.480 --> 56:31.560
I'll get him on the outside.

56:33.760 --> 56:35.960
Leave him all the room in the world.

56:37.080 --> 56:40.199
I've been hit!

56:40.200 --> 56:44.519
He actually turned his wheel there.
The camera will reveal that.

56:44.520 --> 56:47.400
Come on, little Citroen.
Everything you have.

56:53.080 --> 56:56.000
There's the chequered flag.

56:57.520 --> 56:59.359
Second place.

56:59.360 --> 57:02.759
And, amazingly,
third place for Jezza.

57:02.760 --> 57:05.200
Woo-hoo, hoo-hoo!

57:06.680 --> 57:09.399
How good was that?!

57:09.400 --> 57:13.119
That was absolutely brilliant fun.

57:13.120 --> 57:18.999
Two more different cars you can't
imagine pitting against one another
having a great race!

57:19.000 --> 57:21.480
That was tremendous.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.479
That was brilliant! Really.
I know. It was.

57:29.480 --> 57:33.639
One of the best days of my life.
Really and truly, one of
the best days of my life.

57:33.640 --> 57:38.399
We went to prove a point
and we did. My hair feels like
it's standing on end.

57:38.400 --> 57:43.039
And you've got to ask the question,
"Why would you play golf
when you can do that?"

57:43.040 --> 57:46.919
I'm not given to this sort of thing,
as you know, but it was brilliant,

57:46.920 --> 57:50.159
and I even enjoyed watching that
last race with you two.

57:50.160 --> 57:52.559
I'm sorry to keep banging on
about it,

57:52.560 --> 57:59.079
but this whole racing car
costs less than this
plastic bag full of sticks.

57:59.080 --> 58:05.159
But, on the money front, can I inject
a note of caution? If I were
to be racing my Saxo next weekend,

58:05.160 --> 58:08.399
I would want to spend 100 quid
on some stiffer suspension.

58:08.400 --> 58:10.319
It was quite bouncy. Very bouncy.

58:10.320 --> 58:13.879
I'd want to do something about my
rear end, because it was tail-happy.

58:13.880 --> 58:18.719
Yeah. And there will come a time when
the children say, "Mummy,
why aren't we having a holiday?"

58:18.720 --> 58:22.199
"Well, Daddy spent all our money
on shock absorbers."

58:22.200 --> 58:26.479
Yeah, it is going to add up,
but it doesn't matter
because, as we've just proved,

58:26.480 --> 58:31.879
rallycross is brilliant.
I urge you, get a racing licence,
get some cheap wheels,

58:31.880 --> 58:36.559
find the nearest place where you can
do it, get out there and do it.

58:36.560 --> 58:38.879
And all the Garys
are really friendly.

58:38.880 --> 58:43.959
Yes, they are, but the thing is,
the Garys are friendly,
but the Richards, they're not.

58:43.960 --> 58:48.239
I'm sorry to bring this up. Eh?
No, on the last lap,

58:48.240 --> 58:51.439
you tried to ram me off the track.
I did not!

58:51.440 --> 58:54.519
Well, you did.
It was attempted murder.

58:54.520 --> 58:55.999
It wasn't!

58:56.000 --> 58:58.439
All right, look.
As we promised last week,

58:58.440 --> 59:00.759
we'll have a steward's
enquiry about this.

59:00.760 --> 59:04.319
We have on-board cameras.
Let's have a look. Fine. OK.

59:04.320 --> 59:07.759
Coming up to where the
incident happened.
Let's listen to what he says.

59:07.760 --> 59:11.720
Got to shut the door on him here.
I'm sorry. Argh!

59:15.040 --> 59:20.679
You said, "Got to shut
the door on him. Ha-ha-ha-ha!" Yeah.

59:20.680 --> 59:24.919
Well, I did say that. I did.
And you were wrenching the wheel
left. I did not do that!

59:24.920 --> 59:30.279
Look at the steering wheel here.
Look, he's going round a
right-handed corner. Left!

59:30.280 --> 59:32.439
Left again! Left again!

59:32.440 --> 59:35.199
You did! Yeah, I did do that.
Yeah, I did.

59:35.200 --> 59:39.679
So, who here thinks that
Richard Hammond is guilty?

59:39.680 --> 59:43.239
Yes! Well...

59:43.240 --> 59:48.159
Now, if this was Formula 1,
Hammond would be forced to take
a drive-through penalty

59:48.160 --> 59:51.719
and that would spoil the race
for the spectators. Exactly.

59:51.720 --> 59:54.359
So I think we can do it better.
Yeah. Sorry, mate.

59:54.360 --> 01:00:00.039
Listen, it was racing. Honestly.
You little scallywag!
I'll get you next time.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.639
And that, Mr Ecclestone, is how
you deal with disputes.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.519
Done. Absolutely.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.400
It was ruined, though. I don't care.
I could've come last.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.679
And normally, of course,
that would be that,

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.799
but because it's the end of the
series, we've got a treat for you.
Oh, have we ever!

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.520
Because, to play us out, with his
version of Jessica, Slash is back!

01:00:56.982 --> 01:01:07.085

He's a lot better at that than he is
at driving. And he's quicker!
