03:23.458 --> 03:25.208
Earth was so pretty back then.

03:27.583 --> 03:28.541
Give Dad a kiss.

03:30.416 --> 03:31.250
One more.

03:35.125 --> 03:38.041
<i>When I told my daughter</i>
<i>how beautiful Earth used to be,</i>

03:38.833 --> 03:40.083
<i>she didn't say a thing.</i>

03:40.166 --> 03:41.500
<i>Because what she saw</i>

03:42.250 --> 03:43.833
<i>wasn't the same world anymore.</i>

03:46.291 --> 03:50.583
<i>In the past century,</i>
<i>technology has been developing rapidly,</i>

03:51.375 --> 03:54.750
<i>brought about by men's continuous battles</i>
<i>to reign supreme on Earth.</i>

03:55.250 --> 03:57.750
<i>Since the development of military robots,</i>

03:57.833 --> 03:59.916
<i>wars have been skyrocketing all over.</i>

04:00.000 --> 04:02.833
<i>I thought after the battle two years ago,</i>

04:02.916 --> 04:04.333
<i>people would learn their lesson,</i>

04:04.916 --> 04:07.500
<i>and return to a harmonious world.</i>

04:08.791 --> 04:10.250
<i>But I didn't expect</i>

04:10.791 --> 04:14.083
<i>that this became the time</i>
<i>for mankind to pay the price.</i>

04:15.625 --> 04:18.875
<i>Natural disasters,</i>
<i>industrial overdevelopment,</i>

04:18.958 --> 04:20.291
<i>and nonstop wars</i>

04:20.833 --> 04:23.583
<i>made the global ecology worse and worse.</i>

04:24.125 --> 04:26.791
<i>Diseases and famine shroud the world.</i>

04:30.083 --> 04:33.125
<i>The air is now filled</i>
<i>with high levels of toxins,</i>

04:33.791 --> 04:37.083
<i>causing many children to be born</i>
<i>with severe illnesses,</i>

04:39.250 --> 04:41.958
<i>including my own daughter,</i>

04:42.458 --> 04:43.458
<i>Sissy.</i>

04:45.791 --> 04:49.583
<i>To restore the environment</i>
<i>so mankind can get back on track,</i>

04:49.666 --> 04:51.000
<i>governments around the world</i>

04:51.083 --> 04:54.500
<i>started building Skynets</i>
<i>that could purify the toxic air.</i>

04:57.708 --> 04:59.750
<i>But while the Skynets were being built,</i>

04:59.833 --> 05:02.875
<i>a giant meteorite fell onto B16.</i>

05:04.583 --> 05:08.291
<i>And out of it, a giant alien plant</i>
<i>began to emerge.</i>

05:09.083 --> 05:12.541
<i>This plant thrives</i>
<i>when in contact with water,</i>

05:13.125 --> 05:14.375
<i>wreaking serious havoc.</i>

05:15.750 --> 05:19.791
<i>The irony is that it can actually</i>
<i>purify the whole atmosphere.</i>

05:22.791 --> 05:25.250
<i>Scientists have named it Pandora.</i>

05:27.416 --> 05:29.833
<i>The result Pandora will bring to mankind</i>

05:29.916 --> 05:31.208
<i>remains to be seen.</i>

05:31.291 --> 05:33.041
<i>But as a friend once said,</i>

05:33.125 --> 05:35.916
<i>"We write the ending of our own stories."</i>

05:44.958 --> 05:48.375
B16 TEMPORARY COMMAND CENTER

06:06.875 --> 06:08.208
Slacking off again?

06:10.541 --> 06:12.416
Just breathing in some fresh air.

06:13.625 --> 06:15.166
Breathe while you still can.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.500
HQ sent over an entire robot unit.

06:18.583 --> 06:21.166
It seems like
we're in big trouble this time.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.041
It's big, all right.
But it's gonna be a big win for us.

06:24.708 --> 06:25.541
Scared?

06:26.958 --> 06:29.875
Scared? You fly the jet,
I'll take the Command Center.

06:29.958 --> 06:31.583
Sure! I'll fight, you'll attend meetings.

06:31.666 --> 06:32.500
Ouch!

06:34.750 --> 06:37.125
You'll fight? Then we're doomed!

06:40.125 --> 06:41.625
Let me do the suicide missions.

06:42.291 --> 06:43.666
I want to see my daughter sooner.

06:43.750 --> 06:47.083
Sure. So Sissy can
call her father useless.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.041
Say what?

06:48.125 --> 06:50.708
Besides, if I die, what would you do?

06:53.041 --> 06:55.125
You're sick of seeing me all the time?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.416
Well, I'm used to it already!
Do I have a choice?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.541
Oh, really?

07:03.125 --> 07:05.166
The broad is here. Let's go.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.958
Commander Johnson Cheng of B16.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.833
Take me to the Major General.

07:29.875 --> 07:31.208
<i>Timora and Enigma?</i>

07:31.291 --> 07:33.666
<i>I thought HQ already decided</i>
<i>not to use robots.</i>

07:34.625 --> 07:36.750
Robots are often
more reliable than people.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.916
You have a gun.
You rely on it in combat, right?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.208
People wield guns.

07:42.291 --> 07:43.791
Do you trust guns or people?

07:43.875 --> 07:46.500
I trust robots more.
People can make mistakes.

07:50.583 --> 07:51.458
Lucy.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.916
It's hard to repair this watch.

07:56.958 --> 07:59.166
I'll teach you how to,
just in case I don't--

08:05.708 --> 08:08.125
Look at those lovers.
They're always like that.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.666
Don't you plan on coming back?

08:15.750 --> 08:17.375
Of course I want to come back.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.708
But you know how missions can be.

08:19.791 --> 08:20.833
It's hard to say.

08:21.916 --> 08:23.125
Nobody's forcing you to go.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.041
It's the Air Combat Unit.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.500
Why? Do you want to be Commander-in-Chief?

08:46.416 --> 08:47.666
Colonel Tam.

08:50.708 --> 08:52.208
According to scientific research,

08:52.291 --> 08:56.208
Pandora's growth rate is proportional
to the amount of rainfall.

08:57.125 --> 09:00.958
According to the weather forecast,
B16 will experience two rainstorms.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.166
The first one won't have
more than 10 mm of rain,

09:04.250 --> 09:06.583
but it will cover 2 km of the area.

09:06.666 --> 09:10.583
The second one, though,
will exceed 150 mm of rain,

09:10.666 --> 09:14.916
covering the entire B16,
affecting its 5.6-million population.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.125
That's why the operation must succeed
before the second storm.

09:18.208 --> 09:20.166
HQ plans to exterminate it?

09:20.250 --> 09:22.208
Not to exterminate, but to alter it.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.625
This is Dr. Chan Chung Chong, director of
the scientific research institute

09:26.708 --> 09:28.000
that developed the gene bullets.

09:28.083 --> 09:31.166
He will explain in detail
the plan to alter Pandora.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.458
Based on our current findings,

09:36.041 --> 09:39.500
Pandora absorbs pollutants,
then releases harmless hydrogen.

09:39.583 --> 09:43.666
If we can reduce its destructiveness,
there may still be hope for mankind.

09:44.791 --> 09:46.708
Lab number 9 in F9

09:48.083 --> 09:50.125
had a breakthrough discovery
four days ago.

09:51.916 --> 09:56.750
Pandora's cells had an obvious reaction
to a rare virus called P7N9.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.041
The virus triggered
its self-defense mechanism,

09:59.125 --> 10:02.125
dropping its temperature
to negative 30 degrees,

10:02.791 --> 10:04.208
then entered a state of hibernation.

10:07.416 --> 10:09.041
Inside this gene bullet

10:09.750 --> 10:11.458
is the P7N9.

10:11.541 --> 10:15.541
If we can release the virus
inside Pandora's pistil,

10:15.625 --> 10:17.291
we can stop it from growing.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.583
Have you made an assessment

10:19.666 --> 10:22.041
about the success rate of this mission?

10:22.125 --> 10:23.875
To increase our success rate,

10:23.958 --> 10:26.958
HQ has dispatched
the robot unit to execute it.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.250
As long as one gene bullet
can enter the pistil,

10:30.333 --> 10:32.333
our mission will be accomplished.

10:32.416 --> 10:34.750
Major General, if this mission succeeds,

10:34.833 --> 10:37.625
Pandora can be used
to purify the atmosphere.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.083
Purify the atmosphere?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.791
So we'll stop building the Skynets?

10:47.875 --> 10:49.458
Do you have any idea

10:49.541 --> 10:53.291
how much time and effort
I put into building the Skynets?

10:53.375 --> 10:54.458
Major General.

10:54.541 --> 10:58.333
I think HQ has told you
about the importance of this mission.

10:58.416 --> 11:00.708
I hope the Air Combat Unit
will provide assistance.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.458
What if this mission fails?
Do you have a backup plan?

11:10.541 --> 11:11.750
We have a plan B.

11:12.291 --> 11:13.916
We will send out Orca bombers

11:14.000 --> 11:16.791
<i>to destroy Pandora</i>
<i>before the second rainstorm.</i>

11:17.958 --> 11:20.333
<i>Bombing range will be 14 km.</i>

11:20.416 --> 11:24.125
Within estimated 160,000 casualties.

11:26.958 --> 11:28.208
What about evac plans?

11:31.625 --> 11:33.083
No evacuation plans?

11:33.916 --> 11:36.375
If Pandora is not altered
before the second storm,

11:36.875 --> 11:39.541
all 5.6 million people in B16 will die.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.916
And do we ignore the 160,000?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.625
Aren't they people, too?

11:45.541 --> 11:48.333
Unnecessary panic will cost more lives.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.000
That's why this operation
will be classified.

11:57.291 --> 11:58.958
Program input has been completed.

11:59.541 --> 12:03.458
That means the robots can now
execute the mission inside B16.

12:04.333 --> 12:05.250
Commence operation.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.750
The Commander is here!

12:24.125 --> 12:26.958
We will be assisting HQ
in finding Pandora's pistil

12:27.041 --> 12:28.750
in order to reprogram it.

12:28.833 --> 12:31.458
If this mission succeeds,
Pandora will be disarmed,

12:31.541 --> 12:33.208
but will continue to purify the air.

12:33.875 --> 12:36.000
This is the Operation Chief from HQ,

12:36.083 --> 12:37.083
Colonel Tam Bing.

12:41.916 --> 12:44.375
The combat procedure has four stages.

12:44.458 --> 12:49.416
<i>Stage one, ACU and mechanical units will</i>
<i>await instructions at Central Building.</i>

12:51.666 --> 12:55.791
<i>Stage two, shoot contrast agent bombs</i>
<i>during the first rainstorm.</i>

12:59.208 --> 13:02.791
<i>Stage three, once Pandora absorbs</i>
<i>the contrast agent or CA,</i>

13:03.750 --> 13:06.916
<i>the Skyfish will begin scanning</i>
<i>and start searching.</i>

13:08.625 --> 13:13.375
<i>Stage four, the CA will make its way to</i>
<i>Pandora's pistil where they will converge.</i>

13:13.458 --> 13:16.750
After the pistil has been located
and before the second rainstorm,

13:16.833 --> 13:20.500
robots will put gene bullets
in the pistil, which will alter Pandora.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.666
After the bomb drops,
how long till Pandora reacts?

13:23.750 --> 13:27.000
Reaction can be immediate,
or it could take a while.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.583
How long? Three minutes? Five minutes?

13:31.208 --> 13:32.625
What's the wait time for no response?

13:32.708 --> 13:34.083
Can we leave at once if there's none?

13:35.333 --> 13:38.291
How fast can Pandora absorb
the contrast agent we fed if?

13:39.916 --> 13:42.041
This is an unprecedented operation.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.416
Our scientists still have to
analyze Pandora's condition.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.791
You just need to follow
the Command Center's order to the letter.

13:50.583 --> 13:51.666
Do you know the variables that

13:51.750 --> 13:53.250
-exist in every second of an operation?
-Just follow the Command Center's order.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.875
-That's it.
-You don't know, so I'll say it.

13:54.958 --> 13:56.750
We'll get turbulence flying low.
Pandora will attack!

13:56.833 --> 13:58.541
Lives are on the line! Do we improvise?

13:58.625 --> 14:00.208
Do you know how many of us died
three months ago?

14:00.291 --> 14:03.000
In every mission,
there is always uncertainty.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.083
Only one thing is certain.

14:08.166 --> 14:11.625
Don't lose track of the CA's signal,
because if you do, the mission fails.

14:14.541 --> 14:15.750
I don't care if I die,

14:16.708 --> 14:18.375
but I won't let my men die with me.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.583
I don't think
this man's right for this mission.

14:26.708 --> 14:28.208
But he's the only one I trust.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.500
Then we'll use Plan B.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.625
There will be no Plan B for us.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.625
After Pandora appeared, the air improved.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.166
God is giving us this opportunity.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.791
The mission isn't just for us,
but for everyone.

14:49.666 --> 14:51.250
There's only one plan

14:51.333 --> 14:52.541
to accomplish this mission.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.291
These are dark hours
for the sky and the Earth,

15:01.875 --> 15:03.041
but not for our minds.

15:03.791 --> 15:05.500
Okay, men, let's go!

15:06.000 --> 15:06.958
Yes, sir!

15:11.000 --> 15:13.083
<i>ACU is about to take off.</i>

15:13.875 --> 15:16.625
<i>Ground crew, please evacuate.</i>

15:18.708 --> 15:20.250
-Be on alert.
-Yes, sir!

15:24.166 --> 15:25.208
Paratroopers, ready.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.000
ACU, get ready for takeoff.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.583
<i>All units, perform final inspections.</i>

15:39.083 --> 15:40.375
<i>Orca 086, ready.</i>

15:41.375 --> 15:44.875
<i>Command Center, ACU is ready,</i>
<i>requesting clearance for takeoff.</i>

15:54.416 --> 15:56.125
Air space is cleared for takeoff.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.083
Request granted.

16:00.875 --> 16:01.708
Copy.

16:01.791 --> 16:03.166
ACU is taking off.

16:25.791 --> 16:27.875
<i>086 calling Command Center.</i>

16:27.958 --> 16:29.666
<i>Current altitude 3,000 m.</i>

16:30.208 --> 16:32.333
<i>Distance from target area 24 km.</i>

16:32.416 --> 16:34.666
<i>Estimated contact with the target</i>
<i>in six minutes.</i>

16:38.875 --> 16:40.625
B16 TEMPORARY SETTLEMENT AREA

16:40.708 --> 16:42.041
Here. Over here!

16:46.791 --> 16:47.666
Hey!

16:50.125 --> 16:51.375
This is great stuff!

16:51.458 --> 16:54.208
Not the '78 remake, but the '56 original.

16:54.291 --> 16:57.500
This classic is impossible to find.
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</i>

17:06.458 --> 17:08.583
HQ flew in two Orcas this morning.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.625
And three Skyfishes
are escorting one Orca now.

17:11.708 --> 17:13.250
What are you? A military expert?

17:13.333 --> 17:14.875
What do you know, cyclops?

17:30.833 --> 17:33.000
Hey! You didn't pay me for the movie!

17:40.291 --> 17:41.666
SKYNET PROJECT

17:41.750 --> 17:45.041
A cumulonimbus at 2 o'clock, 15 km away.

17:45.125 --> 17:46.541
About to form a thunderstorm belt.

17:47.458 --> 17:48.541
Copy.

17:48.625 --> 17:51.458
Command Center, ACU is right on course.

17:51.541 --> 17:54.541
<i>ACU's position 19 km from base.</i>

17:54.625 --> 17:56.541
<i>Distance from target 5 km.</i>

17:56.625 --> 17:58.625
<i>Estimated contact with target</i>
<i>in one minute.</i>

18:04.375 --> 18:05.916
Come on! Focus!

18:06.000 --> 18:06.916
Um.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.208
She didn't want you to go.
She's worried about you.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.750
I know she's worried about me.

18:12.833 --> 18:15.875
<i>But I'm a radioman, I also want to help.</i>

18:16.458 --> 18:18.750
Wow! Tough guy! Mwah!

18:18.833 --> 18:20.000
Urgh.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.916
Want to make out first before we get off?

18:26.750 --> 18:29.666
<i>ACU, maintain our strategic formation.</i>

18:30.750 --> 18:32.083
-<i>Copy.</i>
-<i>Copy.</i>

18:36.041 --> 18:39.000
Wind speed at target area Level 4.
Air current intensified.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.375
Expect extreme weather.

18:40.458 --> 18:41.708
<i>Attention, ACU!</i>

18:41.791 --> 18:44.333
<i>You're about to enter</i>
<i>a strong convective rain belt.</i>

18:44.416 --> 18:46.125
<i>Make sure to maintain your course.</i>

18:47.875 --> 18:50.458
<i>Command Center,</i>
<i>we have sighted rainfall.</i>

18:52.041 --> 18:53.916
<i>Growth reaction in Pandora detected.</i>

19:03.125 --> 19:05.833
<i>Command Center,</i>
<i>we are approaching the target area.</i>

19:06.708 --> 19:08.083
Attention, ACU!

19:08.166 --> 19:09.708
<i>Entering preset position.</i>

19:09.791 --> 19:11.125
<i>Perform final inspection.</i>

19:11.625 --> 19:13.500
<i>Ready to launch CA bombs.</i>

19:20.375 --> 19:21.916
Skyfish, start the scanner.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.041
Scanner is in order.

19:29.125 --> 19:32.083
<i>015, target locked.</i>
<i>046, target locked.</i>

19:33.458 --> 19:36.291
<i>Command Center,</i>
<i>all Skyfish targets are locked.</i>

19:36.375 --> 19:37.750
Pandora's begun absorbing water.

19:39.750 --> 19:40.875
Commence stage one.

19:40.958 --> 19:42.291
ACU, commence stage one.

19:42.375 --> 19:43.750
Ready to launch CA bombs.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.083
<i>Five-second countdown.</i>

19:45.166 --> 19:48.916
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

19:57.708 --> 20:00.500
<i>Command Center,</i>
<i>all six CA bombs have hit the target.</i>

20:02.041 --> 20:04.875
Yeah! We've hit target number two!

20:04.958 --> 20:06.375
Yeah!

20:09.958 --> 20:11.750
<i>Pandora has started absorption.</i>

20:11.833 --> 20:13.041
Consistent with our forecast,

20:13.125 --> 20:15.666
Pandora will release
the contrast agent as a gas,

20:15.750 --> 20:16.625
forming smoke.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.333
<i>ACU, track the CA signal.</i>

20:21.416 --> 20:22.291
<i>Copy.</i>

20:22.375 --> 20:24.750
<i>We'll report the coordinates</i>
<i>once the pistil is found.</i>

20:25.375 --> 20:28.000
Attention, ACU.
You've entered the rain cloud range.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.916
<i>Airflow is extremely unstable.</i>

20:38.500 --> 20:40.625
<i>CA signal is moving downward</i>
<i>at high speed.</i>

20:44.208 --> 20:45.416
<i>Everyone, follow me!</i>

20:51.625 --> 20:54.125
<i>Pandora is starting to attack! Stay alert!</i>

21:08.166 --> 21:09.541
<i>My right engine is on fire.</i>

21:11.333 --> 21:13.416
<i>Starting to stall. Descending quick!</i>

21:15.291 --> 21:16.541
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

21:19.833 --> 21:21.291
046! 046!

21:30.125 --> 21:31.500
Skyfish 046 down.

21:34.250 --> 21:35.875
I'll keep tracking the CA signal.

21:38.583 --> 21:40.041
015, I need back up!

21:40.625 --> 21:41.500
Copy!

21:47.416 --> 21:49.375
015, let's go down at nine o'clock.

21:50.000 --> 21:50.833
Copy!

22:18.583 --> 22:21.166
Coming in, Command Center.
Skyfish 015 down.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.541
Are you okay?

22:31.041 --> 22:34.000
086's fuel tank is damaged.
Fuel level is going down fast.

22:41.791 --> 22:42.916
Lincoln, Connor.

22:45.250 --> 22:46.500
Prepare to fire.

22:51.166 --> 22:52.458
Hold on tight.

23:33.625 --> 23:35.875
Command Center,
confluence point is found.

23:35.958 --> 23:37.250
Location near Central 5th Street.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.541
<i>Beginning the scan now.</i>

23:38.625 --> 23:40.166
All three CA signals are back.

23:41.041 --> 23:43.000
<i>I repeat, near Central 5th Street.</i>

23:43.583 --> 23:44.500
<i>Beginning the scan now.</i>

23:44.583 --> 23:46.208
The pistil is below ground level.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.833
Commence stage 4. Drop the robots.

23:48.916 --> 23:50.125
Copy.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.041
<i>Fixing device released.</i>

23:56.125 --> 23:57.250
<i>Paradrop released.</i>

23:58.000 --> 23:59.250
<i>Enigma ready.</i>

24:01.000 --> 24:02.333
<i>Timora ready.</i>

24:13.875 --> 24:15.916
<i>Signal interrupted! Signal interrupted!</i>

24:16.000 --> 24:17.500
Try other channels.

24:40.666 --> 24:43.708
Reporting,
Orca is off course. Orca is off course.

25:12.208 --> 25:14.375
Orca vanished off the radar.

25:14.458 --> 25:15.833
I believe it is crashed.

25:23.625 --> 25:26.166
Command Center, pistil scanning complete.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.875
I repeat, scanning complete.
Do you read me?

25:28.958 --> 25:29.958
TARGET IS FOUND, TARGET IS LOCKED

25:30.041 --> 25:31.541
We're losing the signal.

25:33.250 --> 25:35.291
<i>Low fuel! Low fuel!</i>

25:40.291 --> 25:41.458
Brace for impact!

26:51.916 --> 26:53.500
-<i>Daddy.</i>
-<i>Hmm?</i>

26:53.583 --> 26:54.958
<i>You should go to work.</i>

27:00.958 --> 27:01.958
<i>Daddy.</i>

27:07.916 --> 27:09.666
<i>This will keep you safe.</i>

27:10.750 --> 27:13.125
<i>Whitie and I will wait for you</i>
<i>to come back.</i>

27:29.666 --> 27:33.125
Connor! Connor! Connor, wake up!

27:33.208 --> 27:34.125
Wake up!

27:34.666 --> 27:35.666
Look at me!

27:45.708 --> 27:47.125
Hang in there!

27:47.666 --> 27:49.208
Hey! Hey! Help me!

27:51.041 --> 27:52.166
Get the first aid kit!

28:05.166 --> 28:06.291
How bad are you hurt?

28:06.375 --> 28:07.791
Can you still go on?

28:07.875 --> 28:08.791
I think so.

28:08.875 --> 28:10.000
Give me the kit!

28:11.041 --> 28:12.125
Where is the kit?

28:12.708 --> 28:13.625
It's on the plane.

28:14.291 --> 28:15.416
Call Command Center.

28:19.041 --> 28:20.333
No signal.

28:28.666 --> 28:30.125
There's a hospital nearby.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.875
Let's see what we can find
to stop his bleeding.

28:35.166 --> 28:37.375
Mobilize other troops
to look for survivors.

28:47.833 --> 28:49.541
The mission failed. Time for plan B.

28:49.625 --> 28:51.416
Order Orca 2 to do a final inspection--

28:51.500 --> 28:52.666
The mission hasn't failed yet.

28:53.708 --> 28:55.583
We have three hours before the next storm.

28:55.666 --> 28:58.125
We just need to locate them first,
then the mission goes on.

28:58.208 --> 28:59.708
But all the planes used in the operation--

28:59.791 --> 29:01.541
No signal only means we've lost contact.

29:02.791 --> 29:04.291
Even if they are still alive,

29:04.375 --> 29:05.666
if we cannot locate the pistil,

29:05.750 --> 29:07.708
our operation cannot proceed.

29:07.791 --> 29:09.166
All the water has converged.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.291
They're close to the pistil.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.791
-Who else can go now?
-I'll go.

29:18.541 --> 29:19.708
With what?

29:19.791 --> 29:21.083
We have another Orca.

29:21.166 --> 29:23.416
You can't! If anything happens
to this Orca,

29:23.500 --> 29:24.916
we can't execute plan B.

29:25.541 --> 29:28.083
Then I can drive a vehicle,
or I can even go on foot.

29:31.416 --> 29:32.958
A hundred sixty thousand.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.416
There's still time. Just let me try!

29:39.083 --> 29:41.250
Plan B will be carried out as scheduled.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.208
You only have three hours.

30:12.916 --> 30:14.208
Why was the signal cut off?

30:14.708 --> 30:16.791
I've checked with the weather officer.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.500
A current of over 70,000 volts was found

30:19.583 --> 30:21.083
where Orca vanished on the radar.

30:21.916 --> 30:23.125
Probably a thunderstorm.

30:23.208 --> 30:27.166
A thunderstorm can't cause two planes
to lose contact for over ten seconds.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.666
So don't speculate. I want answers.

30:31.541 --> 30:33.250
My boyfriend was on that plane.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.375
Then help me find the answer.

31:31.791 --> 31:33.875
Get an oxygen mask. Let him use it.

31:37.041 --> 31:38.125
You wear one, too.

31:45.416 --> 31:47.625
He's bleeding. Help me!
We have to apply pressure.

31:47.708 --> 31:49.250
Press it! Harder!

31:51.875 --> 31:54.625
Look after him.
I'll look for a hemostatic injection.

31:54.708 --> 31:57.875
Stay there. Don't let go!
Like this! Keep it pressured.

32:02.375 --> 32:04.583
Turn the GPS on. Wear your headphones.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.333
HOSPITAL LOBBY, TRIAGE STATION, LIFT

32:43.458 --> 32:44.916
This seems out of place here.

32:46.083 --> 32:46.916
Hey!

32:50.000 --> 32:51.041
It's much better here.

32:53.125 --> 32:54.875
Something happened to the ACU, huh?

32:55.833 --> 32:57.333
So you want me back?

33:00.583 --> 33:02.916
After the mission, you can keep the truck.

33:04.333 --> 33:06.000
Just the truck? Are you that cheap?

33:06.583 --> 33:07.958
Three years of water vouchers.

33:08.041 --> 33:09.416
I'll be risking my life.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.958
Food stamps for four years.
I have them now.

33:11.041 --> 33:12.000
What else?

33:12.083 --> 33:13.416
You really think I'm cheap?

33:22.375 --> 33:23.208
Don't tell me…

33:23.958 --> 33:25.708
you've forgotten how to use it?

33:38.875 --> 33:39.750
Lieutenant Taron Yau!

33:41.083 --> 33:42.041
Um.

33:42.125 --> 33:43.083
Let's go!

33:45.625 --> 33:47.833
Hey! Skunk! How does the movie end?

33:48.541 --> 33:50.083
The ending is tragic.

33:50.166 --> 33:52.500
Humans were defeated.
Aliens conquered them!

33:52.583 --> 33:53.750
Not worth watching!

33:53.833 --> 33:56.875
But not this ending.
We're gonna decide on that.

33:57.916 --> 34:00.333
The seat is too damn high!
What are you, a dwarf?

34:01.958 --> 34:04.125
We lost Skyfish 086 at 47th Street.

34:05.916 --> 34:06.958
Rescuing your friend?

34:07.041 --> 34:09.625
No. We're rescuing <i>our</i> friend.

34:10.250 --> 34:12.583
Okay, after we've rescued him,

34:12.666 --> 34:14.041
-tell him to apologize to me.
-Just drive!

34:25.125 --> 34:28.833
B16 TEMPORARY SETTLEMENT AREA BORDER

35:01.875 --> 35:02.833
Go take a look.

35:03.458 --> 35:04.333
I'll be fine.

36:36.625 --> 36:37.458
Connor!

36:38.041 --> 36:38.875
Do you read me?

36:39.875 --> 36:40.750
<i>Connor!</i>

36:41.250 --> 36:42.458
<i>Connor!</i>

36:42.541 --> 36:43.625
Tyler, do you read me?

36:43.708 --> 36:44.541
Tyler?

37:35.708 --> 37:36.541
SEARCHING FOR SIGNAL

37:45.458 --> 37:46.416
Lincoln?

37:47.416 --> 37:48.250
Lincoln?

38:16.291 --> 38:18.083
TYLER, LINCOLN, CONNOR

38:18.750 --> 38:20.958
Command Center,
we got signals from the 086 men.

38:21.041 --> 38:22.750
Location, Victoria Hospital.

38:24.208 --> 38:26.291
VICTORIA HOSPITAL, 2.2 KM

38:35.750 --> 38:37.208
-Obey orders, okay?
-Got it!

38:37.291 --> 38:38.791
-All orders!
-I heard you!

40:06.791 --> 40:08.708
Come on!

40:10.250 --> 40:11.125
Take this.

40:52.833 --> 40:54.333
I'm going back
for Lincoln and Connor.

40:55.916 --> 40:57.916
Command Center,
we discovered an unknown creature.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.708
JOHNSON CHENG

41:08.833 --> 41:09.666
Hey!

41:10.583 --> 41:11.416
Where's Lincoln?

41:13.666 --> 41:14.625
I'm asking you.

41:15.791 --> 41:16.833
Where's Lincoln?

41:17.541 --> 41:18.458
They killed him.

41:26.958 --> 41:27.916
<i>Are you okay?</i>

41:28.541 --> 41:30.291
How dare you even ask me that?

41:32.750 --> 41:34.208
Why did you drive off without permission?

41:34.791 --> 41:36.208
Do you know how many died because of you?

41:38.958 --> 41:40.000
I asked them all to come--

41:40.083 --> 41:41.208
That was not the first time!

41:43.750 --> 41:45.000
Sean Li, that cripple…

41:45.708 --> 41:46.958
Skynet is all he thinks about.

41:47.750 --> 41:48.625
The order today…

41:49.208 --> 41:50.916
a suicide mission. Can't you see that?

41:51.000 --> 41:55.041
Yes, but the Skynets' construction is
important to the B16 region.

41:56.833 --> 41:57.791
So are…

41:59.375 --> 42:00.416
our lives.

42:01.250 --> 42:02.333
We'll die out there.

42:04.916 --> 42:06.875
If you're so afraid to die,

42:07.500 --> 42:08.833
you shouldn't be a soldier.

42:20.041 --> 42:21.583
<i>The unit doesn't need you.</i>

42:34.791 --> 42:35.833
Anything else?

42:42.333 --> 42:44.000
-And…
-What else?

42:44.083 --> 42:45.833
Go to the armory, hand in your gun.

43:07.625 --> 43:08.458
Step back!

43:12.833 --> 43:14.125
Skunk, find us a way out.

43:14.875 --> 43:16.250
Got it!

43:22.583 --> 43:24.166
Listen up. Go straight.

43:24.250 --> 43:25.708
<i>When you reach the end, turn right.</i>

43:29.041 --> 43:31.875
Just wait for me.
I'm gonna make you a way out of there.

43:35.625 --> 43:36.875
That's it. Go in.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.625
I'm out of ammo.

44:00.083 --> 44:01.333
The air vent!

44:02.208 --> 44:03.291
Which air vent?

44:30.583 --> 44:31.458
What's going on?

44:31.541 --> 44:33.958
Hasn't HQ conducted a full assessment?

44:34.750 --> 44:36.125
Carry out plan B now.

44:40.083 --> 44:42.500
Major General,
the mission hasn't failed yet.

44:42.583 --> 44:43.458
Shut up!

44:44.541 --> 44:46.125
You can't justify it anymore.

44:46.208 --> 44:47.833
If you dare to disobey my order,

44:49.000 --> 44:50.125
I will have you dismissed.

44:53.500 --> 44:55.041
Any signal of the confluence point?

44:58.125 --> 44:59.375
Connor, send this…

44:59.458 --> 45:00.333
Connor!

45:00.416 --> 45:02.166
Send this to the Command Center.

45:07.666 --> 45:08.875
<i>Command Center,</i>

45:08.958 --> 45:10.333
we're about to transmit pistil scan.

45:14.250 --> 45:15.666
Copy. Transmit now.

45:19.875 --> 45:21.666
<i>We have received</i>
<i>the pistil scan from ACU.</i>

45:22.250 --> 45:23.166
Send it over.

45:29.250 --> 45:31.041
Looks almost as we thought it would be.

45:32.125 --> 45:34.166
The mission is still on course, sir.

45:34.875 --> 45:37.250
We have two hours
before the next rainstorm.

45:37.333 --> 45:38.833
We won't abort the mission.

45:40.125 --> 45:42.250
If we don't have enough time for plan B,

45:42.958 --> 45:45.958
you should know
the consequences of this decision.

45:46.791 --> 45:47.666
Get out!

45:51.166 --> 45:52.541
Pistil's location confirmed.

45:58.333 --> 46:00.000
LUCY

46:03.000 --> 46:04.333
I told you not to go.

46:05.125 --> 46:06.166
But you didn't listen.

46:09.791 --> 46:11.375
You'd better hang in there.

46:11.458 --> 46:13.625
You haven't fixed my watch yet.

46:13.708 --> 46:14.708
Do you hear me?

46:14.791 --> 46:16.208
<i>You cannot die.</i>

46:23.625 --> 46:25.708
Let's go to where
the transport plane crashed.

46:25.791 --> 46:27.166
We must find the gene bullets.

46:27.666 --> 46:29.791
-We're still going? We'll die!
-<i>Obéit!</i>

46:33.333 --> 46:34.750
Even the transport plane crashed?

46:36.208 --> 46:37.166
Yes.

46:41.125 --> 46:42.958
You're sure the gene bullets are intact?

46:48.458 --> 46:50.291
Hey! Think this over!

46:50.375 --> 46:51.833
We'll lose our lives!

46:52.791 --> 46:54.291
Why did you take him?

46:54.375 --> 46:56.041
He almost blew us to pieces back there.

46:57.333 --> 46:59.625
Are you talking about me, huh?

47:00.458 --> 47:01.500
I'm doing my best here.

47:01.583 --> 47:03.708
But it doesn't mean you're doing great.

47:04.833 --> 47:07.416
Yeah! You're… awesome!

47:17.333 --> 47:18.791
The unit doesn't need you.

47:25.208 --> 47:27.666
Thirty years of brotherhood, man.

47:34.208 --> 47:35.875
You hit it hard. Of course it hurts.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.458
You're right! Thirty years!

If plan A does fail,

48:00.333 --> 48:02.791
HQ's Plan B will be to bomb Pandora.

48:03.291 --> 48:07.041
That's great, then! Problem solved!
We'll build more Skynets.

48:07.125 --> 48:08.583
Explosion range is 14 km.

48:10.291 --> 48:11.833
There won't be time to evacuate!

48:12.458 --> 48:14.333
There is no evacuation plan.

48:15.500 --> 48:17.125
HQ estimates the casualty of…

48:18.291 --> 48:19.458
160,000.

48:26.083 --> 48:27.666
We must finish this mission.

48:39.708 --> 48:41.291
<i>37.5 kHz.</i>

48:41.875 --> 48:43.541

It's still in the crash site.

48:49.458 --> 48:52.500
Command Center, we received
the signal of the gene bullets.

48:52.583 --> 48:54.708
We're headed
to the plane crash location right now.

48:54.791 --> 48:55.666

Okay! Let's move it!

50:14.625 --> 50:16.291
You stay behind. Watch the truck.

50:27.916 --> 50:29.041
Let me come, sir.

50:34.125 --> 50:35.125
Yeah, that's right!

50:35.208 --> 50:36.750
Or they'll think you're a loser.

50:42.791 --> 50:44.166
Please, don't leave!

50:51.250 --> 50:52.083
Stay with her!

50:54.166 --> 50:55.208
Keep her company.

50:55.291 --> 50:56.125
Um.

51:31.666 --> 51:32.541
Sorry, sir.

51:34.666 --> 51:35.666
Take it easy.

51:38.375 --> 51:39.875
Do you think I'm useless, sir?

51:41.333 --> 51:44.000
No. Every post has its purpose.

51:49.458 --> 51:50.500
That's why

51:51.125 --> 51:52.625
we are called a team.

51:58.750 --> 51:59.833
Don't go.

52:02.791 --> 52:06.208
When we went to the hospital
to get medicine,

52:06.291 --> 52:07.541
Mom asked me to wait.

52:07.625 --> 52:10.083
She left but she never came back for me.

We've done everything we can.

52:48.708 --> 52:49.791

52:55.250 --> 52:56.583
I'm not gonna leave you again.

53:09.666 --> 53:11.083

with this injector.

You really are playing this trick now?

55:25.000 --> 55:27.291
Without me, you're toast!

55:30.041 --> 55:31.666
This place will collapse soon.

55:31.750 --> 55:34.083
We leave now or else we die.

55:39.041 --> 55:40.958
This old thing is a useless piece of junk.

55:41.041 --> 55:44.250
Yeah. While there's still time,
go and replace it.

55:45.416 --> 55:46.916
Why not replace me as well?

55:48.625 --> 55:51.833
Dream on! It's just you and me now.
Don't you run out on me!

55:51.916 --> 55:53.708
There are two people outside.

55:54.833 --> 55:56.666
Yeah, a dummy and an imbecile.

55:56.750 --> 55:59.875
Perfect! Here we have
a sourpuss and an old geezer.

56:00.583 --> 56:01.625
Screw you, man!

56:14.583 --> 56:15.708
The box is up there.

56:17.541 --> 56:19.000
It must be 20 m high.

56:20.375 --> 56:22.041
If we both go, we might not make it.

56:22.125 --> 56:23.625
Maybe the imbecile can help us?

56:28.833 --> 56:31.791
If he didn't agree to drive,
you'd still be at the hospital.

56:32.625 --> 56:34.916
Be the big man here.
Give him another chance.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.333
<i>If you're so afraid to die,</i>

56:40.083 --> 56:41.583

Stop!

57:29.333 --> 57:30.291
I see the gene bullet!

57:35.625 --> 57:36.750
A grenade pin?

57:37.458 --> 57:40.708

58:56.833 --> 58:58.833
<i>Hurry, Tyler. It's about to collapse.</i>

58:58.916 --> 58:59.833
A little more.

59:28.166 --> 59:29.625
Tyler, hurry up.

1:00:18.750 --> 1:00:19.833

1:01:26.250 --> 1:01:27.541
Who says I'm afraid to die?

1:01:27.625 --> 1:01:29.833
Hurry up! It's collapsing!

1:01:34.458 --> 1:01:35.500
I'll do it!

1:01:37.166 --> 1:01:40.125
By the way, tell your friend
I'm not here to rescue him.

1:01:40.208 --> 1:01:42.666
And not only did I do the job,
I was so awesome.

1:01:42.750 --> 1:01:43.791
Just do it!

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.083
Did I do an awesome job?

1:02:09.166 --> 1:02:10.375
Yes, you're amazing.

1:02:10.458 --> 1:02:12.166

1:02:59.125 --> 1:03:02.083
Let's go. We've only got
30 minutes. Central 5th Street.

1:03:02.166 --> 1:03:03.000
Copy.

1:03:03.083 --> 1:03:04.416
What are you doing there?

1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:06.791
The robots were the ones
who bombed down Orca.

1:03:08.333 --> 1:03:11.000
I found this grenade pin
from one of the robots.

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.125
This was planned. It wasn't an accident!

1:03:18.125 --> 1:03:19.833
Someone wants the mission to fail.

1:03:28.083 --> 1:03:29.625
Someone controlled the robots.

1:03:30.416 --> 1:03:32.791
Whoever it is, ordered the plane bombed.

1:03:33.958 --> 1:03:35.958
It must be that woman! She's the only one
who can control the--

1:03:36.041 --> 1:03:38.125
Someone else can, Sean Li.

1:03:39.208 --> 1:03:41.791
Major General,
if this mission succeeds,

1:03:41.875 --> 1:03:44.375
Pandora can be used
to purify the atmosphere.

1:03:46.375 --> 1:03:48.125
So we'll stop building the Skynets?

1:03:48.208 --> 1:03:49.333
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

1:03:49.416 --> 1:03:52.458
<i>how much time and effort</i>
<i>I put into building the Skynets?</i>

1:03:55.083 --> 1:03:58.000
There should be evidence of Li sending
out the command in this robot's head.

1:03:58.083 --> 1:03:59.083
-Find it!
-Yes, sir!

1:04:15.125 --> 1:04:15.958
Really?

1:04:16.541 --> 1:04:18.708
Stop already. You can still turn back.

1:04:19.458 --> 1:04:21.791
The day I started building the Skynets,

1:04:22.500 --> 1:04:25.750
I already knew
that I would devote myself to it.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000
<i>Even if it meant sacrificing you,</i>

1:04:29.083 --> 1:04:31.708
<i>or the lives of 160,000 people,</i>

1:04:31.791 --> 1:04:33.541
I have no intention of turning back.

1:04:33.625 --> 1:04:36.166
Cut the crap. It's all for money, right?

1:04:36.250 --> 1:04:38.000
<i>That's what you think? Money?</i>

1:04:38.958 --> 1:04:43.625
The Skynet is me, I… I am the Skynet.

1:04:43.708 --> 1:04:45.541
Am I making myself clear?

1:04:46.333 --> 1:04:48.375
<i>One Enigma, one Timora,</i>

1:04:48.458 --> 1:04:50.041

We'll talk if you survive.

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:55.583
Who knows? Maybe we will.

1:04:56.291 --> 1:04:57.125
That's great!

1:04:57.708 --> 1:04:58.666
Why don't we begin?

1:04:59.750 --> 1:05:02.375
<i>HQ won't receive any news</i>
<i>from you anymore.</i>

1:05:02.458 --> 1:05:05.416
<i>Let us see if you can get past</i>
<i>Timora and Enigma.</i>

1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:06.416
<i>Good luck.</i>

1:05:07.583 --> 1:05:08.833
We've lost the vehicle's signal.

1:15:48.166 --> 1:15:49.166
Yes, ma'am.

1:15:52.458 --> 1:15:54.166
TIMORA, COMMAND ACTIVATED

1:15:57.375 --> 1:15:58.916
<i>We must find a way to contact HQ.</i>

1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.166
<i>Or else, they will go ahead with plan B.</i>

1:16:01.250 --> 1:16:02.833
We're here. Stop!

1:16:19.625 --> 1:16:22.583
It took 14 seconds for Orca
to lose contact and disappear.

1:16:23.125 --> 1:16:24.500
So I checked the communication log.

1:16:24.583 --> 1:16:28.041
I saw that we received a long military
radio wave at the same time.

1:16:29.208 --> 1:16:31.041
The wave was sent by Timora.

1:16:31.708 --> 1:16:34.541
It intercepted all signals within 5 km.

1:16:36.875 --> 1:16:38.958
There're only two people here
who can do that.

1:16:50.041 --> 1:16:51.125
Come on.

1:16:58.625 --> 1:16:59.458
Connor!

1:17:00.125 --> 1:17:02.416
Use this bomb.
Make a hole into the pistil.

1:17:03.333 --> 1:17:04.250
Roger that.

1:17:09.833 --> 1:17:11.166
No.

1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:22.583
Make sure you finish the task.

1:17:22.666 --> 1:17:23.583
Yes, sir!

1:17:32.083 --> 1:17:36.000
You must hide. Find a place
inside that bus. Okay? Go now.

1:17:37.458 --> 1:17:38.416
Don't worry.

1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:40.250
We'll all come back safely.

1:17:41.208 --> 1:17:42.208
Go now.

1:17:42.708 --> 1:17:43.833
Come on!

1:17:46.375 --> 1:17:48.333
Be a good girl! Come with me!

1:17:48.416 --> 1:17:49.291
Come on!

1:17:56.333 --> 1:17:57.666
Pansy is a tough one!

1:18:25.625 --> 1:18:29.125
Hey! That thing's coming.
Let's lure it away.

1:18:31.375 --> 1:18:32.250
No.

1:18:33.833 --> 1:18:35.083
We'll exterminate it.

1:18:41.958 --> 1:18:45.625
I'll take down the signal jammer.
We must stop HQ from executing plan B.

1:18:47.916 --> 1:18:48.791
Okay.

1:18:49.333 --> 1:18:50.625
The two of us

1:18:51.208 --> 1:18:52.333
will take it down!

1:18:58.041 --> 1:18:59.125
Action!

1:20:22.708 --> 1:20:24.625
ACU's signal is back.

1:20:24.708 --> 1:20:26.333
They've reached Central 5th Street.

1:20:27.625 --> 1:20:29.250
FILE INFORMATION,
COMMAND INPUT: 15:18, SEAN LI

1:20:59.083 --> 1:21:01.291
I've already received
the robot's action records.

1:21:04.750 --> 1:21:07.250
Cancel all robot commands immediately!

1:21:13.208 --> 1:21:14.958
Did you think
you could get away with this?

1:21:23.541 --> 1:21:24.833
It will rain soon.

1:21:25.750 --> 1:21:27.750
Your plan B has already started.

1:21:31.791 --> 1:21:33.375
They have to beat Timora first.

1:21:34.208 --> 1:21:35.375
Even if they do that,

1:21:36.416 --> 1:21:37.833
they have to blast a hole

1:21:37.916 --> 1:21:40.500
and find the route towards the pistil.

1:21:41.750 --> 1:21:43.291
You had an hour to do that.

1:21:43.875 --> 1:21:46.583
But now, you only have ten minutes left.

1:21:49.916 --> 1:21:51.291
<i>Low battery! Low battery!</i>

1:21:51.375 --> 1:21:52.750
Skunk, have you dozed off?

1:21:54.750 --> 1:21:56.000
Out of the way!

1:22:10.375 --> 1:22:11.416
Timora, right?

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:13.875
I'll beat the hell out of you!

1:22:21.166 --> 1:22:22.291
Run!

1:22:32.666 --> 1:22:34.000
Connor!

1:22:50.958 --> 1:22:52.375
Connor! Get out of there!

1:22:55.375 --> 1:22:56.291
Run!

1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:15.500
Don't be scared!

1:23:16.083 --> 1:23:17.166
I'm gonna be fine.

1:23:19.083 --> 1:23:21.125
Run! Hurry!

1:23:32.166 --> 1:23:33.791
<i>Low battery! Low battery!</i>

1:24:05.416 --> 1:24:08.333
SISSY

1:24:29.291 --> 1:24:30.666
Pansy!

1:24:48.958 --> 1:24:50.333
Don't go.

1:24:53.916 --> 1:24:55.333
I'm not gonna leave.

1:25:00.583 --> 1:25:01.916
I'm not gonna leave you again.

1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:42.583
Come on!

1:25:42.666 --> 1:25:44.083
Let's see who'll die first.

1:26:07.375 --> 1:26:10.458
SISSY

1:26:14.208 --> 1:26:15.958
We have to go on!

1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:26.500
<i>Pandora is starting to grow.</i>

1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.666
<i>Orca is already hovering</i>
<i>over Pandora's pistil.</i>

1:26:46.958 --> 1:26:48.166
Come on!

1:26:49.166 --> 1:26:51.166
Do you really think
I would die just like that?

1:26:52.625 --> 1:26:54.583
I told you there wouldn't be a plan B.

1:26:55.458 --> 1:26:57.791
We are the ACU team from B16.

1:27:11.291 --> 1:27:13.791
HQ, this is ACU. We're in position.

1:27:13.875 --> 1:27:15.416
<i>Ready to enter the pistil.</i>

1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.166
Suspend bombing operation!

1:27:18.875 --> 1:27:21.166
I repeat. Suspend bombing operation!

1:27:21.250 --> 1:27:22.666
<i>Orca 2, copy.</i>

1:27:28.208 --> 1:27:29.416
Risking our lives

1:27:30.625 --> 1:27:32.458
for 160,000 people.

1:27:33.833 --> 1:27:34.875
It's all worth it!

1:27:35.916 --> 1:27:36.916
Let's go all the way.

1:28:01.583 --> 1:28:02.708
Command Center.

1:28:05.625 --> 1:28:07.041
I have entered the pistil.

1:28:34.375 --> 1:28:36.125
So those bugs come from here.

1:28:50.625 --> 1:28:53.583
<i>"The Skynet is me, I'm the Skynet"?</i>

1:28:55.458 --> 1:28:56.458
<i>Well, Sean Li.</i>

1:28:58.166 --> 1:28:59.375
<i>Go to hell!</i>

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:39.625
PANDORA

1:29:43.125 --> 1:29:44.166
Pandora…

1:29:46.166 --> 1:29:47.958
<i>Pandora has stopped growing!</i>

1:30:14.583 --> 1:30:15.416
Yes!

1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:01.250
A WEEK LATER

1:31:05.958 --> 1:31:09.166
<i>Dr. Chan's successfully</i>
<i>altered Pandora's genes.</i>

1:31:09.666 --> 1:31:11.041
<i>It's harmless now.</i>

1:31:11.125 --> 1:31:13.291
<i>It can even purify the atmosphere.</i>

1:31:13.958 --> 1:31:15.875
<i>Although Sissy wasn't able to see it,</i>

1:31:15.958 --> 1:31:17.500
<i>Pandora's arrival</i>

1:31:18.125 --> 1:31:20.875
<i>gave the Earth a chance to be reborn.</i>

1:31:21.958 --> 1:31:23.916
<i>We have to cherish this opportunity.</i>

1:31:26.750 --> 1:31:28.208
Hey! Would you stop that?

1:31:28.291 --> 1:31:30.041
I keep cleaning here,
you keep drawing there.

1:31:31.375 --> 1:31:33.541
Come on! Kids are like that.

1:31:33.625 --> 1:31:34.708
What are you doing?

1:31:34.791 --> 1:31:37.000
You think it's cool
to sunbathe in a leather jacket?

1:31:37.083 --> 1:31:38.500
And look at that hairstyle!

1:31:39.708 --> 1:31:41.041
So what?

1:31:42.166 --> 1:31:43.375
What do you know, man?

1:31:43.458 --> 1:31:46.125
I'm wearing this while sunbathing,
so I'd burn more fat.

1:31:46.208 --> 1:31:48.625
And I just follow
Johnson Cheng's advice for the hair.

1:31:48.708 --> 1:31:50.500
He said that I looked better
with short hair.

1:31:53.208 --> 1:31:54.791
Johnson was right again.

1:31:54.875 --> 1:31:57.125
We write the ending of our own stories.

1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:01.500
And he disappeared
when it's time to wash the truck.

1:32:03.583 --> 1:32:04.708
Where did he go anyway?

1:32:05.333 --> 1:32:08.333
To a meeting at HQ.
Do you think he's off shooting somewhere?

1:32:08.416 --> 1:32:11.041
Another meeting? And at HQ?

1:32:11.541 --> 1:32:12.958
Smells like trouble to me.

1:32:13.041 --> 1:32:15.916
It's big, all right.
But it's gonna be a big win for us.

1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:33.875
<i>We only have 72 hours this time.</i>

1:32:33.958 --> 1:32:36.125
<i>Our mission is to observe</i>
<i>the source of the signal.</i>

1:32:36.208 --> 1:32:38.333
<i>Do not make any unnecessary contact.</i>

1:32:38.416 --> 1:32:40.291
<i>Just observe? No contact?</i>

1:32:42.375 --> 1:32:45.708
<i>You used to tell Sissy</i>
<i>how beautiful Earth was from the Moon.</i>

1:32:45.791 --> 1:32:47.916
<i>Now, you have the chance</i>
<i>to see it yourself.</i>
