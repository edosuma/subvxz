-Humidity and freshly washed hair.
-Looks gorgeous on you.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.646
Everyone's got hats on.
I've got my hair up.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.649
That means that you can tell
it is nasty outside.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.901
-I'm not letting it frizz my hair.
-Me either.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.362
It's so rainy. It's gloomy and stuff.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.740
A good opportunity for a dossier.

00:31.823 --> 00:32.907
Yeah.

00:33.450 --> 00:37.746
So, this week,
we have Leonardo Loria Rico, a.k.a. Leo.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.956
-Cute.
-Beer.

00:43.084 --> 00:47.672
I make whatever you want me to make.
I'll make it special. I'll put love.

00:48.089 --> 00:53.803
The first time I met Leo,
we worked at the same restaurant.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.972
[chuckles] We used to flirt a lot.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.309
He never thought he was gonna get married,
have kids.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.228
Been married for six years,
have two boys,

01:02.437 --> 01:06.232
and Leo turned into a better father
than I imagined.

01:06.316 --> 01:11.571
But I am nominating Leo
because he is a ginormous slob.

01:11.654 --> 01:15.617
-He just leaves his stuff everywhere.
-[Leo] I'm very bachelor-style.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.620
I feel like I'm picking up
after three children.

01:18.703 --> 01:22.582
I tend to do things my way,
which is, like, sloppy.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.628
That drives me crazy.
He doesn't have a stereotypical adult job.

01:26.711 --> 01:30.423
I'm used to being the late-night person.
I'm like a vampire.

01:30.507 --> 01:33.176
[Bethany] Every night,
he's bringing bar food home.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.971
Chances are, you open the fridge,
there's going to be leftovers.

01:37.055 --> 01:41.351
There's only so many days in a row
I can eat Tater Tots reheated.

01:41.434 --> 01:46.064
I really wish he would cook more
because, I mean, he's good at it.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.066
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.

01:48.691 --> 01:54.072
When I look at Leo, I see a sexy beast,
but I never see him look past a mirror.

01:54.155 --> 01:57.075
All right, "Hey, sexy."
I'd love to see that.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.995
[Leo] When people look at me,
I can tell if they don't like me.

02:01.079 --> 02:05.125
What I show to people
sometimes might not be the full me.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.044
[Antoni]
Leo has an important event this week.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.714
He's gonna be attending his first
Parent-Teacher Mixer with Bethany.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.426
Leo's uncomfortable around other dads
and worries he's being judged.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.555
Ugh. I know that feeling.
When I got my kids, they were like:

02:18.638 --> 02:21.432
"Are you the big brother?
Are you gonna be a good parent?"

02:21.516 --> 02:24.102
-I was like, "Don't judge me."
-Mind your business.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.771
[Bethany] I think he believes
others are judging him,

02:26.855 --> 02:30.525
-so he judges himself.
-I don't have a lot of parent friends.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.153
[Bethany]
I'd love to have some joint friends,

02:33.236 --> 02:36.281
but it's like pulling teeth to get him
to socialize with others.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.950
It's that fear that I won't be accepted.

02:39.367 --> 02:42.829
I'd really love to see him take
his bartender personality

02:42.912 --> 02:45.206
and use that in social situations.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.919
And I wish when he went into school
with the kids, he could hold his head high

02:50.003 --> 02:54.716
because he is an amazing husband
and father, and he's providing for us.

02:55.174 --> 02:59.053
She thinks I have potential
for a better self. Ha!

02:59.137 --> 03:01.180
What's our mission, honey?

03:01.264 --> 03:04.767
Let's show this married bachelor
that he's a rad dad.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.686
Yeah.

-[Antoni] Four types of pasta

that I found in your fridge
with two containers of peas.

07:20.314 --> 07:21.482

-Typical pasta.

-No. We've been trying to get pasta--

it's romantic.

-Yes.
-I'm pretty much with shorts downstairs.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.106
-Sometimes, I just wear my underwear.
-You're gross.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.151
A lot of the T-shirts
in your drawer are sloppy.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.527
I don't mind this one.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.614
If you were to dress this up,
wear some nice jeans,

08:09.697 --> 08:12.450
nice shoes, a jacket,
I can make that work.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.913
However, a lot of them look
like you've worn them 1,000 times.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.581
They look like student clothes.

08:18.664 --> 08:22.585
-It's clothing, who cares?
-I can't believe that you don't care.

08:23.085 --> 08:26.506

where Bethany says:

08:26.589 --> 08:29.717
"Leo's my guy. And look at him,
he looks fantastic."

08:29.800 --> 08:32.887
-We need to step it up.
-I'm very simple in clothing.

08:32.970 --> 08:36.140
I think about that when we go back
into the pictures.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.060
In all the pictures,
I have the same clothing.

08:39.143 --> 08:40.603
This isn't doing you favors.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.189
I wanna get you
to where you've got options

08:43.272 --> 08:46.984
that slim you down, make you feel
confident, make you feel dressed up.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.488

08:51.739 --> 08:53.991
Welcome to my office. It's gorgeous.

-It's nice. Ooh.
-Very convenient.

08:56.452 --> 08:59.372
-[Leo] My claws?
-What's going on there?

08:59.455 --> 09:02.208
Uh... I don't cut my nails that often.

09:02.291 --> 09:05.586
You could climb a tree with those
toenails. We gotta deal with that.

09:05.670 --> 09:09.048
When you look in the mirror,
do you like the way you look?

09:09.131 --> 09:12.718
Sometimes I got problems
with my hair on the sides.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.971
-It gets sloppy and horrible.
-Yeah.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.598
Having it too long is too much
of a hassle.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.976
How do you feel
when you're not in the bar?

09:20.059 --> 09:23.437
Does it make you feel
like people judge you in some way?

09:23.521 --> 09:26.524
-I think they do.
-I think you're an attractive man.

09:26.607 --> 09:30.194
But by just, like,
doing a couple of things here and there,

09:30.278 --> 09:34.198
it will up your confidence,
so that you do feel more comfortable.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.286
We don't have that much storage.
The storage I have is weird.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.747
They're big cabinets,
but I cannot put small stuff.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.166
-So, you need more storage?
-Yeah.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.877
The living room is where we spend
most of our time.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.045
Why is it red?

09:48.129 --> 09:52.008
I was gonna paint all these walls red,
so I started here, then I didn't finish.

09:52.091 --> 09:52.925
[Bobby] Okay, good.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.385
[both laughing]

09:54.468 --> 09:57.263
Red actually is a color
that makes you anxious.

09:57.346 --> 10:00.683
So, blues, grays,
those are more soothing, happy colors.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.728
This isn't the best layout for this room.

10:03.811 --> 10:07.648
Somebody told me not to put
in a corner a TV, the layout is weird.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.609
I was like, "I want it there."

10:14.030 --> 10:16.365
[Karamo]
So, you have a big event at the school?

10:16.449 --> 10:20.036
They do these Parent-Teacher Mixers.

10:20.119 --> 10:24.040
And every time, I say no.
I find an excuse like, "I have to work."

10:24.123 --> 10:26.292
-Got it.
-Wifey was like, "No, not this time."

10:26.375 --> 10:28.377
What's your relationship with the others?

10:28.461 --> 10:31.839
-Nonexistent. [laughs]
-Nonexistent. Why's that?

10:31.922 --> 10:35.718
I definitely felt that, you know,
just the glances sometimes.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.929
And I'm a bartender.
I think people prejudge me.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.765
It doesn't make me feel good.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.267
Wifey encourages that I call the dads

10:43.351 --> 10:46.979
and like, "You wanna bring the kid here?
Maybe they could play together."

10:47.063 --> 10:50.358
I have a feeling that if I did that,
it would benefit me,

10:50.441 --> 10:52.193
and my kids and wife would be happy.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.321
I want to make more time for them
that I don't right now.

10:55.404 --> 10:57.948
-Why are you getting emotional?
-I love my kids.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.122
And I want to be with them.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.959
They mean everything to me.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.921
I can tell you're a great father.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.758
It's just figuring out those ways
around the fear.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.470
Hanging out with other dads
who understand what you're feeling

11:19.553 --> 11:22.264
gives you an opportunity
to hang with the kids,

11:22.348 --> 11:25.393
but also relieve the stress
and guilt you're feeling

11:25.476 --> 11:28.896
-that you're not doing enough.
-I want to change something.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.942
Or not to change,
but I call it "evolve part of your life."

11:33.025 --> 11:37.613
That's exactly it.
You have to know how to evolve.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.824
-I have to know that.
-That is phenomenal.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.450
[Jonathan] Hey, guys, catch me.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.202
Just kidding.

11:44.036 --> 11:48.040
I got a little tense for a second
or emotional, so to speak.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.377
-I'm scared.
-We'll be gentle.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.461
Please.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.798
Your wife, Bethany, told us
that you are her sexy man.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.008
-She said sexy beast.
-Sexy beast.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.137
Anytime a woman calls you a sexy beast,
you gotta hit your chest.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.930
-I do the dance.
-What's the dance?

12:03.013 --> 12:05.349
-Oh, no, it's the dance.
-No, you dance.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.893
-All right.
-That's your game?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.479
Oh, yeah, baby, come on.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.106
[pop music playing]

12:20.531 --> 12:22.491
[Antoni] Leo is passionate about food,

12:22.575 --> 12:26.078
and I want Leo to prepare meals
for his wife and kids

12:26.162 --> 12:29.498
that they can have when they come home,
and everything is ready.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.584
[Bobby] I wanna make sure
I show Leo and Bethany,

12:31.667 --> 12:34.879
don't let the kids take over
every aspect of your home.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.006
Everyone needs to have
that place to chill,

12:37.089 --> 12:39.675
and when there's chaos everywhere,
you can't chill.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.803
[Jonathan] He's an attractive, lovely man.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.931
We can polish him up,
and we can turn him out a bit.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.725
We just need to unleash it.

12:52.188 --> 12:56.775
Leo is truly living like a bachelor.
All I see is college student, single guy.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.320
A guy who hangs out
at a bar every night.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.113
We need to step it up.

13:01.530 --> 13:05.034
My hope is that Leo can get
his dad groove back.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.454
Where he feels really cool
about being a dad.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.377
-[Tan] All right, ready for this?
-[Leo] I am.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.380
I'm about to open my eyes
to something different.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.925
-A little bit nervous? [laughs]
-Yes.

13:21.008 --> 13:24.929
I've been into this store many a time.
It's one of my favorites

13:25.012 --> 13:28.807
for somebody who, uh, is slightly taller,
and you've got proportions

13:28.891 --> 13:31.894
that do require a store
that has larger options.

13:31.977 --> 13:32.853
Mm-hm.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.898
What parts do you love about your body,
and what parts do you think:

13:35.981 --> 13:40.110
-"I don't wanna highlight"?
-Well, I like my shoulders and my legs,

13:40.194 --> 13:43.364
-but I don't like the muffin top.
-We all got it.

13:43.781 --> 13:47.952
I wanna concentrate on a slimmer fit that
will give you a nicer look to your leg.

13:48.536 --> 13:52.206
If you wear a wide leg,
you're just gonna look short and big.

13:52.289 --> 13:55.501
These are jeans that are soft,
it's not actually denim.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.671
You like comfort, so I wanna go
with something that has stretch.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.757
I've noticed that, too.
That stretch is comfortable.

14:02.633 --> 14:07.263
[Tan] We've got the Parent-Teacher Mixer.
Something like a blazer could be great.

14:07.680 --> 14:12.059
I always liked blazers, but I've never
found one I like that would fit me.

14:12.142 --> 14:16.313
You can wear it with jeans,
with trousers, with sneakers, with a boot.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.023
I love a simple polka dot.

14:18.107 --> 14:22.069
As opposed to going for the printed tee,
go for a printed shirt.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.905
-Shoes.
-I'm a big guy, I step hard.

14:24.989 --> 14:29.159
I'd really want to find a shoe
that's gonna be strong and comfortable.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.370
That will last more than six months.

14:31.453 --> 14:35.249
Get your shoes from a place like this,
they have a wider foot.

14:35.332 --> 14:38.252
It's gonna accommodate your foot
the way you need.

14:38.335 --> 14:41.589
I get that Leo's daunted
by being around other fathers,

14:41.672 --> 14:44.508
and if I were dressed that way,
I would, too.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.761
I want him to feel confident,
secure and empowered

14:47.845 --> 14:49.221
meeting these fathers.

14:49.805 --> 14:52.141
Let's take a look. Whoo!

14:52.433 --> 14:55.603
Let's add in a little bit of style.

14:55.686 --> 14:58.564
I'm gonna roll these sleeves
a couple of times.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.691
A better version of casual?

15:00.774 --> 15:03.777
Yeah. I think it could be more formal
like a parent.

15:03.861 --> 15:08.032
'Cause sometimes they see me
as the older brother picking up the kids.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.409
It's gonna give you a shape you want.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.495
I've given you a shorter jacket
than the T-shirt.

15:13.579 --> 15:18.500
We're mixing the proportions, so not only
do you focus on your slim parts,

15:18.584 --> 15:21.295
you don't focus on the parts
you don't want to focus on.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.088
They're not noticing that.

15:23.172 --> 15:26.634
It doesn't show me like a big guy.
More like a comfortable person.

15:26.717 --> 15:30.220
Yeah. I want you to start
to realize you don't need to wear

15:30.304 --> 15:33.599
those shorts and T-shirts.
Feel comfortable in this.

15:33.682 --> 15:37.186
Men have body issues.
We are as insecure as women are.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.813
We just don't talk about it comfortably.

15:39.897 --> 15:43.067
I want it to be a real conversation
we can all have.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.819
Okay, great. Come on. This is gonna work.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.530
These jeans are made
for super-tall people.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.491
-We'll have them altered.
-Okay.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.786
I don't want it to be too high.
Slip this on for me.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.329
-Okay.
-Yeah.

15:56.205 --> 16:00.417
Look in the mirror. Tell me
what you're seeing, feeling and thinking.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.671
-I see a stud. [laughs]
-You see a stud?

16:04.171 --> 16:07.800
I love that the suit is fitted.
It's nice and slim.

16:08.217 --> 16:11.345
The fact that it just about closes,
I want that.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.931
If it's too roomy,
it's not the right size.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.141
Okay. I thought it was the opposite.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.852
You'll look
like you're drowning in the suit.

16:18.936 --> 16:22.398
So, I want you to keep it open.
It gives you a nice line.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.400
That's taking 20 pounds off you.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.194
If you close that,
it would highlight your stomach.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.238
Also, we've tucked in your shirt.

16:29.321 --> 16:33.534
If I leave it open, and it hangs down,
you'll look bigger and shorter.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.244
-Yeah.
-You don't want that.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.579
I think I feel comfortable
going out in this.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.707
You look appropriate for your age.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.667
You look like a rad dad.

16:48.507 --> 16:52.469
The biggest problem in Leo's house,
it's more a nursery than a home.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.346
The kids' stuff, it's everywhere.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.765
And Daddy's toys
all over the place as well.

16:56.849 --> 17:01.353
So, I wanna make storage spaces
the boys can use and the adults can use.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.981
We have to cover up the air conditioning.

17:04.064 --> 17:07.317
We need to put a vent
at the front of this, at an angle.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.486
-Yeah.
-I know you've always got it.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.904
-All right.
-Thank you.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.616
Living room, living room.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.535
Put your back into it, man.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.919
What we're doing
is, uh, we're going traditional.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.713
-Okay.
-Super old-school.

17:27.796 --> 17:30.174
[speaking in Italian]

17:30.340 --> 17:32.426
-Good evening. Good to see you.
-How are you?

17:32.509 --> 17:34.595
-Nice to meet you.
-Leo, this is Riccardo.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.889
I love traditional Italian food.

17:36.972 --> 17:40.184
There is no place better.
So, I'm excited to be here.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.269
Will you teach us how to make fresh pasta?

17:42.352 --> 17:44.396
-We've got to get you an apron.
-Me, too?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.774
-You don't get anything. [laughs]
-Okay.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.651
Somebody who loves Italian food
the way Leo does,

17:49.735 --> 17:54.823
he's the perfect candidate for me
to preach the fresh pasta gospel to.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.577
To mix the dough, we're gonna do it
with the well system.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.039
Make a well, crack the egg,
put it in the middle. There.

18:02.998 --> 18:06.752
The slower you mix,
the more flour is gonna get incorporated.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.879
Just making scrambled eggs.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.881
See how it's coming into a ball?

18:10.964 --> 18:13.509
It's not like a pastry dough
you can overwork.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.385
You're never gonna overwork this.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.846
[Antoni] Fresh pasta,
it's just so delicate.

18:17.930 --> 18:22.684
It's so easy to make. Anybody can make it.
It's better than reheating bar food.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.729
[Riccardo] Put it like this,
and squeeze it through.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.689
[Antoni] It's the right amount of flour.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.609
Put it through until the clumps are gone.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.528
-One more time.
-A couple times.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.405
-Like I'm touching chewing gum.
-Yeah.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.700
-Other way. You wanna go this way.
-Other way?

18:38.784 --> 18:41.453
-Criss-crossing.
-You do a 90-degree shift.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.288
[Riccardo] Then you stretch it.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.458
We make it a bit shorter
because we wanna discourage

18:46.542 --> 18:48.210
-eating pasta with spoons.
-I agree.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.379
-Well, is that a thing?
-Not for me.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.631
It's better to slurp.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.591
-Exactly.
-That's the fun of it.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.010
You feed it through here, pull it through.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.221
-[Antoni] That's so beautiful.
-[Leo] That's is so--

18:59.304 --> 19:00.931
-[Antoni] It is like angel hair.
-It is.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.850
You just shocked my world.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.769
I always have the idea
that there was so many things to do

19:05.853 --> 19:07.688
before getting to this process.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.482
-Then straight to the--
-[Riccardo] Straight to the water.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.609
[Antoni] Fresh pasta is so good for kids,
too.

19:12.693 --> 19:16.029
You know, my mom used to do butter,
parmesan and ketchup.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.739
-And ketchup?
-In Italy.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.199
It adds sweetness.

19:19.283 --> 19:22.161
No, there's nothing wrong with that
as long as it tastes good.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.829
Let's cook, and let's eat.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.124
You mentioned you cook dinner
twice a week.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.834
Twice a week. Monday's off.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.378
I have time
to set everything into motion.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.839
If you're planning a dinner
on a work night,

19:33.922 --> 19:36.717
your wife comes home
and sees fresh pasta there,

19:36.800 --> 19:39.845
all she has to do is boil water,
throw the pasta in,

19:39.928 --> 19:43.265
-and heat up a sauce that you made.
-That'd be fantastic.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.601
It's romantic.
It's showing up for your family.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.769
-It's interesting.
-Good challenge.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.272
I wanna make something
that they'll be like, "Wow."

19:50.731 --> 19:51.773
-[Riccardo] Gentlemen.
-Yes.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.358
This is a tagliolini.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.612
Now, this is as simple
as a tomato sauce gets.

19:56.695 --> 20:01.992
Nothing is cooked. It is olive oil,
heirloom tomatoes, basil and wild oregano.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.202
[Leo] It looks so great.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.245
[Riccardo &amp; Antoni speaking in Italian]

20:05.329 --> 20:07.539
-Sorry, can we have a spoon, please?
-[laughing]

20:09.666 --> 20:11.543
-This is fabulous.
-Right?

20:11.627 --> 20:15.422
-And it is so simple.
-It is. If you make these in the morning,

20:15.505 --> 20:17.674
let them sit out
at room temperature covered,

20:17.758 --> 20:20.385
it's perfect,
the flavors will come together.

20:20.469 --> 20:24.306
-I'll dream about this tonight.
-Thank you. It was a pleasure.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.395
-I got you. Yeah.
-Thank you.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.606
-Yeah.
-Daddy.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.651
-Give me five.
-Let's dance.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.654
There's some new kids coming in.
Wanna say hi?

20:38.737 --> 20:40.405
-Hey.
-What?

20:40.489 --> 20:44.576
Look, that's Anne Marie, that's Lulu,
that's Genevieve.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.370
All your little friends.

20:46.453 --> 20:49.081
[Karamo] I invited some dads
from your kids' school

20:49.164 --> 20:52.334
because this is a spot
where you can bond, have fun,

20:52.417 --> 20:55.837
enjoy the kids, enjoy the fathers
at a daddy play date.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.547
-What's up, Dad?
-What's up?

20:59.174 --> 21:01.176
[man] Girls, you need to come over here.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.013
Watch that guy. A future CEO.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.474
[man] He could be talking to my wife.

21:07.557 --> 21:08.850
[laughing]

21:10.102 --> 21:12.020
When were you last around fathers?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.398
It's the first time
I've met more than two.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.900
-Today is the first day you--?
-[Leo] Seriously.

21:16.984 --> 21:20.153
The greatest thing for me
when I got the kids was to make sure

21:20.237 --> 21:23.031
that I started to interact
with other dads immediately.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.784
We just could connect,
you just have some fun.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.495
It's a great way
for you to support the kids.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.330
Meet around, mingle.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.458
-Guys, wanna gather around?
-[Leo] All right.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.378
-Scott. Nice to meet you.
-Leo. Nice to meet you.

21:36.795 --> 21:40.215
[Karamo] The fact that Leo is nervous
about not fitting in, I understand.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.844
But I want him to know
that he can be relaxed, be confident.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.930
-You've got this, boo.
-Say hi.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.890
I love your hair, man.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.892
He had that much hair
when he was born.

21:50.976 --> 21:51.977
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:52.519 --> 21:55.772
I'll sit in an airport
and watch other people with kids

21:55.856 --> 21:59.026
quietly reading books, and mine
are running around like banshees.

21:59.484 --> 22:03.405
He knows what's going on, yeah.
Oh, no, here's the child. Take him.

22:04.406 --> 22:07.200
[Karamo] He was worried
everyone was gonna be staring at him

22:07.284 --> 22:10.370
and judging. He needed a push
in the right direction.

22:10.454 --> 22:14.166
Hey, kids, you guys ready to dance?
Friend, wanna dance with me?

22:14.958 --> 22:18.253
I want you to cross your arms,
and you're gonna lean with it.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.757
Look at you. You already look swagged out.
Look at this straight Fab 5.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.841
[laughing]

22:24.468 --> 22:28.096
Good job. I'm no longer sweet dad.
I'm cool dad.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.974
Yeah, lean with it. That's attitude.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.019
-Get it out.
-Now he's busting out the moves.

22:34.102 --> 22:35.937
That's a break dance, buddy.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.816
-We're looking goofy together.
-I love it. Thanks for that.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.776
Goofy is the word.

22:41.234 --> 22:44.654
[Karamo] I wanted Leo to understand
he's not alone in this journey,

22:44.738 --> 22:48.533
and that his kids are gonna be okay,
and that's all that matters.

22:48.617 --> 22:49.576
Nice job, guys.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.204
-Yeah.
-I'll hang out with you anytime.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.790
-Next time we'll play poker.
-Poker.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.839
This is our office. This is the lot.
I'm excited you're here. After you.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.591
-Okay.
-After you.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.301
I'm such a gentleman.

23:06.384 --> 23:08.178
-Bobby.
-Hello.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.262
How's it going?

23:09.346 --> 23:13.225
-Bobby, you're forever architecting.
-Working on something. Right now it's you.

23:13.934 --> 23:17.854
Let's take this down 'cause
we're just doing a big moment today.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.857
You've got
a major asymmetrical bob. Love it.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.567
I have a surprise for you.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.736
-We're doing pedicures, honey.
-Oh, wow.

23:25.362 --> 23:29.658
This is Tamika, this is Angelita.
We are going to have a little spa day.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.702
Once I saw those toes,
or talons as my mom would call them,

23:32.786 --> 23:35.622
I couldn't deal with your hair
until we got your feet sorted.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.916
Can you rest your feet
and get over here?

23:37.999 --> 23:40.794
-I'm doing all the things for you guys.
-Hello, ladies.

23:40.877 --> 23:43.213
-[Tamika] Ever had a pedicure before?
-One time.

23:43.296 --> 23:46.716
-How often do you clip your toenails?
-Every time they're going

23:46.800 --> 23:48.593
right above the other side.

23:48.677 --> 23:52.055
[Jonathan] Society and culture
doesn't teach men to do self-care.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.307
It's not girly, stupid or too much.

23:54.641 --> 23:57.060
It makes your toes look great,
and makes you relax.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.355
How often is right for a pedicure,
once a month?

24:00.438 --> 24:01.356
Definitely.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.441
I'm gonna do a little face mask
on you guys.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.736
-Ooh.
-[Jonathan] I'm a big fan of DIY masks.

24:06.820 --> 24:09.948
I took oats, and I ground them up
in a food processor,

24:10.031 --> 24:12.951
and this is manuka honey,
it promotes skin healing

24:13.034 --> 24:14.744
more than normal honey would.

24:14.828 --> 24:17.831
This is a great mixture to put on
before we shave

24:17.914 --> 24:19.332
or do any sort of skin stuff.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.169
The oats in this
are a gentle exfoliant.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.881
-Your turn.
-[Bobby] Mm. This tastes really good.

24:25.964 --> 24:29.593
-I am gonna try to kiss my wife like this.
-[Bobby] It's really good.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.512
-It is.
-[Bobby] Right?

24:33.138 --> 24:35.015
[Jonathan]
I'll just take this off of you.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.768
-My God, are you falling asleep, Leo?
-No.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.645
[laughing]

24:40.729 --> 24:43.273
So, okay, love it.
Are we done with our pedis?

24:43.356 --> 24:46.943
Look at that toe.
They're gonna be scratching nobody now.

24:47.569 --> 24:51.072
Bobby, look at your face.
It's radiant and moisturized.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.699
And your face, too.

24:52.782 --> 24:55.493
-Thank you so much. Come with me.
-Thank you.

24:56.703 --> 24:59.080
You can step into my gorgeous office.

25:00.707 --> 25:03.960
I'm just gonna clean up
the upper part of your cheek.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.922
And you don't wanna go too low.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.175
It's about working
with the beard you have, which I like.

25:10.258 --> 25:13.678
We're gonna taken your middle out,
and clean it up.

25:14.262 --> 25:17.599
For years, I thought
I was never gonna get a mustache.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.977
-But then you did? [laughing]
-It was like, "Yeah."

25:21.394 --> 25:23.605
I'll take it shorter on the sides
and the back,

25:23.688 --> 25:26.942
but leave length on top
so you can wear it curly.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.944
-[razor buzzing]
-Oh, gosh, she's so loud.

25:29.736 --> 25:31.905
Oh, she gets so angry.

25:32.405 --> 25:36.159
Oh, honey, right there, we can't--
She just gets so strong.

25:36.868 --> 25:40.288
After the conference,
if you accidentally knock your wife up,

25:40.372 --> 25:42.540
name the baby Jonathan.
It's my fault

25:42.624 --> 25:44.459
-because I got you his haircut.
-Funny.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.629
And if you have a girl,
it could be my last name with an A on it,

25:47.712 --> 25:50.840
Vanessa, which was also coincidentally
my drag name.

25:50.924 --> 25:54.135
-And it feels good. It's like, "Vanessa."
-Oh, my God.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.762

26:01.476 --> 26:05.021

26:14.322 --> 26:16.658
and I know this canvas
is willing to be molded,

26:16.741 --> 26:18.702
so I'm willing to make a masterpiece.

26:19.119 --> 26:22.998
Here's the new and improved Leo. Ba-da!

26:23.415 --> 26:25.709

26:25.792 --> 26:27.210
-Do you like?
-I love it.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.212
-How do you feel?
-Feeling fresh.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.715
Get all up in there. Check yourself out.

26:31.798 --> 26:34.426
Look at that. I look so respectable.

26:34.509 --> 26:38.805
-Everyone will take you seriously.
-I just need my golden tooth like:

26:38.888 --> 26:41.850
Get out of here.
We can leave the golden tooth off.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.476
-Fine.
-This is perfect.

-Are you ready?
-Ready or not, it's happening.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.129
[in English accent] Remember
in primary school in South London

27:11.212 --> 27:12.714
where we used to do this?

27:12.797 --> 27:15.759
-We would play blocks.
-And talking with my blocks.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.011
-Then we'd do our German accent.
-[laughing]

27:18.094 --> 27:20.972
-[Truck horn honks]
-Oh, my God. He looks great.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.224
Come on in.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.518
-Welcome home!
-Whoa!

27:25.602 --> 27:28.646
-Oh, my God. Whose house is this?
-Yours.

27:31.900 --> 27:32.776
[Leo] Oh, wow.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.489
-Look at me.
-Oh, you've got goose bumps.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.908
-You've got goose bumps.
-Wow. Look at that.

27:40.575 --> 27:42.827
Your problem was your lack of storage.

27:42.911 --> 27:43.828
Yes.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.998
So, I added these bookcases.
From the waist down,

27:47.082 --> 27:51.711
you've got the boys' space.
Then waist up is family and Mom and Dad.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.547
That is amazing, Bobby.
None of us realized that,

27:54.631 --> 27:58.009
-and we were playing with the toys.
-[Antoni] This flip here with the sofa

27:58.093 --> 28:00.553
-makes it twice as wide.
-You can feel the space.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.473
I like, in a smaller space,
a glass coffee table.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.683
It makes the space feel bigger.

28:05.767 --> 28:06.810
[Fab 5] Aw...

28:08.645 --> 28:10.021
Ready to see some more?

28:11.022 --> 28:15.235
-Whoa. Everything is different.
-[Bobby] I built this bench.

28:15.318 --> 28:18.696
Now you can fit at least seven people
on just the bench.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.031
-We're good.
-Okay.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.616
[Jonathan] There's no wall there.

28:23.993 --> 28:26.204
[Leo] It's a different kitchen.
It looks so big.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.331
-[Bobby] Ready to see more?
-More? Come on.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.666
[all laughing]

28:31.543 --> 28:32.460
Oh, wow.

28:33.711 --> 28:34.963
I love that curtain.

28:35.046 --> 28:38.258
When you have lower ceilings,
a way to make them look taller

28:38.341 --> 28:40.885
is to put the curtain rod higher
than the window.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.430
It gives the illusion
that your ceilings are higher.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.098
Oh, whoa.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.600
-[Bobby] Bethany has her side.
-Okay.

28:48.101 --> 28:52.021
And then you now finally have
a real side of the closet.

28:52.105 --> 28:55.108
Why didn't you put a note
that says "Leo's side"?

28:55.191 --> 28:57.318
You think she's gonna take over? [laughs]

28:58.862 --> 29:00.780
[Jonathan]
Look at this gorgeous bathroom.

29:00.864 --> 29:05.493
There's things I wanna go over with you.
First thing is your hair routine.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.495
This is your cleansing conditioner.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.331
This is gonna allow your hair
to have moisture and shine

29:10.415 --> 29:13.960
and be more manageable.
You're gonna spray this around your waves.

29:14.043 --> 29:15.086
Give me a [clicking]

29:15.170 --> 29:17.839
Yes. Take your fingers
and massage that in.

29:17.922 --> 29:21.134
-Get it all the way to the scalp.
-Yeah, it feels good.

29:21.217 --> 29:24.512
Waves tend to get frizzy
the more you work with them.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.140
Once you get the shape
where you like it, leave it.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.350
And then your mustache.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.520
He's finding his way. He's becoming a man.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.940
Take a little bit of wax,
and then really twist it up.

29:36.024 --> 29:39.444
I could see this world where you're like
a famous Instagramming--

29:39.527 --> 29:42.030
The bartender
with the handlebar mustache.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.615
-See?
-Why not? I love it.

29:43.698 --> 29:45.867
You're ready
to take your new look on.

29:45.950 --> 29:49.245
That's what I like about it.
I'm confident about it.

29:50.413 --> 29:51.498
What do you have here?

29:51.581 --> 29:54.375
-[Antoni] You'll be making dinner...
-I'm gonna make dinner?

29:54.459 --> 29:56.836
-...for your family before your event.
-Okay.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.298
-How are you feeling?
-Compared to when I started this,

30:00.381 --> 30:04.719
a lot better. I feel like the hero
who's at the end of the odyssey.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.347
I love that.
Hero at the end of the odyssey.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.683
We're gonna be making
all'Amatriciana sauce.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.352
So, I got prosciutto.

30:12.435 --> 30:15.230
Take it out of the pan
when it's nice and brown.

30:15.313 --> 30:19.567
You leave the fat there, then I cut up
an onion. Then I cooked it down.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.695
If you're making this for the kids,
you don't want it spicy.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.864
-For now, we're gonna--
-As a good Mexican,

30:24.948 --> 30:27.367
-I need to do that to them.
-There you go.

30:27.450 --> 30:30.912
We have chili flakes that we're adding
to the onion, then tomato paste.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.957
You can buy it in a can.
It's more expensive in a tube,

30:34.040 --> 30:35.583
but it lasts a lot longer.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.546
Have the onions soak up
all the paste and the chili flakes.

30:39.629 --> 30:41.589
Now, we're gonna put in tomatoes.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.591
What I like about crushed,

30:43.675 --> 30:46.177
I wanna have chunks
of the tomato with the sauce.

30:46.261 --> 30:49.013
I like that it's imperfect.
That's all you need.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.432
Here's another new baby.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.601
-Do you know what this is?
-No.

30:53.685 --> 30:57.272
This is a pasta machine.
It kneads it, and it pumps it out.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.399
Wow, this is fantastic.

30:59.774 --> 31:03.403
I don't know how I'm gonna relax.
This has been such a great time.

31:03.486 --> 31:04.612
[laughing]

31:04.696 --> 31:08.324
Yesterday, how did you feel
knowing that these other fathers

31:08.408 --> 31:10.368
were feeling exactly what you were?

31:10.451 --> 31:13.454
It feels great to be not alone
in these situations.

31:13.913 --> 31:19.085
Now I understand wifey going, you know,
dating with her friends and the kids.

31:19.168 --> 31:21.170
-They do have a great time.
-Yeah.

31:21.254 --> 31:25.675
Tonight, you're gonna be doing something
that you haven't been open to.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.135
We'll see how it goes.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.345
I think I'm getting
all the tools together.

31:29.429 --> 31:32.599
-How are you feeling about it?
-I'm gonna let go.

31:32.682 --> 31:33.975
I'm gonna be more relaxed.

31:34.058 --> 31:37.562
When you get there, try to connect
with the other fathers.

31:37.645 --> 31:38.479
Yeah.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.982
-Check in with your wife there.
-Mm-hm.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.860
Let her see that you wanna try,
you wanna change.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.695
That this is the new you.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.281
[Tan] Are you excited to see your clothes?

31:48.364 --> 31:52.410
-[Leo] Oh, wow.
-I've given you options that work easily.

31:52.493 --> 31:55.705
You like logos, so I wanna give you
at least some print

31:55.788 --> 31:58.875
that shows a bit of personality,
but it's not a logo.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.377
-Yeah.
-You're close to a certain age, 40.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.838
It's creeping up.
You wanna look appropriate.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.132
-We're not 25 anymore.
-No, we're not.

32:06.215 --> 32:08.635
-We have to dress a certain way.
-Even if I look 40.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.386
Exactly. Exactly.

32:10.970 --> 32:12.931
I wanted to give you some T-shirts

32:13.014 --> 32:16.476
with a little more interest to them,
so I call them basic plus.

32:16.559 --> 32:18.561
-Like this one.
-Yeah, exactly.

32:18.645 --> 32:22.065
It's more age appropriate to go
for something like a placket or a pocket.

32:22.148 --> 32:25.818
Something that isn't saying,
"I wanna get drunk with my mates."

32:25.902 --> 32:28.321
I've also got you shoes.
I love these.

32:28.404 --> 32:31.574
You can wear them with blue,
black, with cream, navy.

32:31.658 --> 32:33.868
There's so many clothes
you can wear with this.

32:33.952 --> 32:37.038
They're the only clothes you'll go for
unless you choose a pink.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.248
-Don't go for those.
-[laughing]

32:39.332 --> 32:41.042
-Ready to try on some clothes?
-Yeah.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.335
-[Tan] Boys, ready?
-Yeah.

32:42.418 --> 32:46.381
-[Bobby] Of course. We've been ready.
-Come on through, you handsome bugger.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.840
[all shouting]

32:48.883 --> 32:50.718
-Slick, right?
-[Jonathan] So slick.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.012
Super slim. How do say it? Like rad.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.931
-There you go.
-[Bobby] That looks like a start

32:55.014 --> 32:57.684
-to some cheesy sitcom of the '90s.
-Oh, yeah.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.894
-We have to do it like this.
-Yeah. Hello.

33:00.311 --> 33:03.690
If I show up like this at work,
nobody would recognize me.

33:03.773 --> 33:06.150
If you showed up in that,
you'd be getting tips.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.151
Yeah.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.654
I like this combination with the shoes.

33:09.737 --> 33:11.406
The boots are good, right?

33:11.489 --> 33:13.866
-So, they are boots? They go up?
-Yeah.

33:13.950 --> 33:17.120
[Karamo] When you walked in,
you looked bigger than you do now.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.540
These clothes have made you look
so much slimmer.

33:20.623 --> 33:24.377
The busy print will help distract from
any areas you're not comfortable with.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.295
-[Karamo] Come in the middle.
-We're not moving.

33:26.587 --> 33:30.216
-Do you feel confident in your clothes?
-Yeah, everything has changed.

33:30.299 --> 33:34.303
You opened my mind in ways
I didn't think it was gonna be.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.015
You're like a talking mirror.

33:37.098 --> 33:40.268
You're telling me what I already know,
but I need to be told.

33:40.351 --> 33:43.354
As much as I hate it sometimes,
like the first day I was like:

33:43.438 --> 33:47.108
"It hurts,"
but if you don't realize that yourself,

33:47.191 --> 33:50.611
nobody else is gonna tell you.
You have done that,

33:50.695 --> 33:53.364
I don't know how I'm gonna live
without my favorite five.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.283
-[all laughing]
-My fabulous five.

33:55.867 --> 33:59.996
Um, I'll try to influence
somebody else like this.

34:00.079 --> 34:02.874
-I'll try to pass on what I learned here.
-Good.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.918
No, it's important that we, as dudes,
learn that.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.253
-Yeah.
-Absolutely.

34:07.628 --> 34:11.007
I thank you a lot, a lot.
I really-- I'm gonna miss you.

34:11.090 --> 34:14.052
-Tomorrow, I'll be like:
-We're gonna miss you.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.220
-"Where are they?"
-[all laughing]

34:16.637 --> 34:17.847
[Tan] I'm looking at a new man.

34:17.930 --> 34:20.099
-I hope you feel as good as we see you.
-[Leo] I do.

34:20.641 --> 34:24.729
Like, you're such an inspiration.
Just like the American dream, honey.

34:24.812 --> 34:27.106
A father. You work,
you're raising your kids,

34:27.190 --> 34:30.485
you're a freaking immigrant,
you're gorgeous, and you're killing it.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.862
Everything we've shown you,
you deserve it.

34:32.945 --> 34:35.615
-You've been open to all of it.
-Absolutely.

34:35.698 --> 34:39.577
-Bring something positive to the table.
-You have got an event to get ready for.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.204
-Love you.
-Love you, guys.

34:41.287 --> 34:43.164
Enjoy your new home. Have fun tonight.

34:43.247 --> 34:46.209
-Bye, Leo.
-Bye, Leo.

34:46.292 --> 34:47.251
Bye.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.961
[pop music playing]

35:03.643 --> 35:05.436
[Antoni] We're making affogato,

35:05.520 --> 35:09.565
which is, like, a super traditional,
après dinner, little dessert.

35:09.649 --> 35:11.692
It's vanilla gelato with espresso.

35:11.776 --> 35:15.071
-All right, let's go watch.
-Girl, this is so lit.

35:15.154 --> 35:17.949
-[Karamo] It looks yummy.
-I love how shocked you are.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.618
-[laughs]
-All right, time for Leo.

35:22.161 --> 35:24.622
-[Tan] Oh, look at him.
-[Karamo] He's such a cutie.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.958
[Bobby] He's so excited for his wife.

35:27.041 --> 35:29.502
He's so excited to show her
the house and himself.

35:29.585 --> 35:33.005
Hi. You look so good.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.048
Ta-da!

35:36.008 --> 35:38.052
-[Jonathan] Yeah.
-[Antoni] She went right in for it.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.512
Here we go, kid number three.

35:39.595 --> 35:41.639
-Look at this.
-You look so good.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.391
Oh, my God, look at you.

35:44.725 --> 35:46.269
-Ta-da!
-Let me see. Give a twirl.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.312
Oh, baby.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.022
Tongue.

35:50.648 --> 35:53.025
Get your boys. Your boys wanna see you.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.902
-[Leo] Let's go.
-[Bethany gasps]

35:54.986 --> 35:58.698
Oh, my God. It looks so grown-up.

36:00.616 --> 36:03.119
[chuckles] Look at this island.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.040
-I can fit everything in there.
-I know.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.459
Oh, my gosh. It's so great.

36:10.793 --> 36:11.961
Oh, it's not over.

36:12.044 --> 36:13.462
-No? No?
-No.

36:14.463 --> 36:17.258
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

36:17.341 --> 36:19.802
What did they do to my room? [chuckles]

36:20.803 --> 36:22.054
[all laughing]

36:22.138 --> 36:25.057
-She literally stopped in her tracks.
-She's like, "Whoa."

36:25.141 --> 36:29.187
-Okay.
-First of all, your side, my side.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.023
-[laughing]
-Yeah, that's right.

36:32.106 --> 36:34.442
-Look at this.
-You have grown-up clothes.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.485
I have, like, clean underwear.

36:36.986 --> 36:40.573
Shows how dirty his underwear was.
That's what he pointed out.

36:40.656 --> 36:45.161
And that's what a gasp she gave,
like, "Clean underwear, wow!"

36:45.244 --> 36:46.537
[laughing]

36:46.996 --> 36:49.749
I've conquered some fears.
I've been in public with people.

36:49.832 --> 36:53.252
I can't wait for tonight.
So far, I'm ready for it, like...

36:53.628 --> 36:56.047
-I'm gonna make you proud.
-I am so proud of you.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.757
I'm already proud of you.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.802
I'm gonna make you fresh pasta
from scratch.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.012
Well, I'm starving.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.306
-Okay. I'll get ready.
-I'll be back.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.100
-I'll let you know when I'm ready.
-Wonderful.

37:11.687 --> 37:12.980
[whistling]

37:13.522 --> 37:16.776
[Antoni] If he prepares his pasta
ahead of time, which is easy,

37:16.859 --> 37:18.736
when his wife comes home,

37:18.819 --> 37:21.072
she'll eat with the kids,
and think about him.

37:21.155 --> 37:22.406
Totally, I love that.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.492
She'll be slurping that noodle down,
thinking of Leo.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.370
Orson, what's happening?
Are you getting hungry?

37:28.371 --> 37:31.332
Yes, you are. Me, too, man.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.501
[boy] What's going on?

37:33.584 --> 37:35.670
One of the reasons
I wanna have kids

37:35.753 --> 37:38.631
-is so I can show them how to cook.
-That moment right there.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.842
Don't touch it.
Just see how it's coming out.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.928
-[Tan] I love that.
-You get to connect with them.

37:44.470 --> 37:49.183
Oh. So, it's not the best pasta.
All right, this is not working.

37:49.558 --> 37:53.521
-Oh, my gosh, what happened, Leo?
-[laughing]

37:53.604 --> 37:56.691
I'm cheating now.
The other one didn't work out.

37:56.774 --> 37:59.819
What he ended up using
was supposed to be décor.

37:59.902 --> 38:01.112
-I know.
-Correct.

38:01.654 --> 38:05.324
-What happened with it?
-I don't know. I'm horrified.

38:05.866 --> 38:07.702
Dude, he's thrifty. I like it.

38:09.912 --> 38:14.041
Excuse me, there's a very gorgeous
French braid on the television

38:14.125 --> 38:16.002
that was not there a few seconds ago.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.545
-She looks cute.
-Really cute.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.839
-Hello.
-Hi.

38:19.922 --> 38:22.591
-How are you doing?
-It smells delicious.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.093
You are gorgeous.

38:24.176 --> 38:27.263
[Jonathan] If we had not come in
and changed his little trajectory,

38:27.346 --> 38:30.308
that pretty lady was gonna be
putting on her Giuseppe Zanottos

38:30.391 --> 38:32.018
-and leaving.
-Zanottis.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.060
Zanottis.

38:33.144 --> 38:36.981
Oh. Daddy did good on dinner, didn't he?

38:37.440 --> 38:40.109
I wonder if he's gonna do as good
on this as he did on pasta.

38:40.192 --> 38:41.944
[all laughing]

38:43.195 --> 38:45.156
Hey, you guys, I'm here.

38:45.239 --> 38:47.074
-[Bethany] Hey, Donna.
-Hi.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.744
-You never hire a cute babysitter.
-[Karamo] She's harmless.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.246
That's what Maria Shriver thought.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.041
-Wait till you see Leo. I know.
-I can't wait.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.168
[Jonathan] speaking in Italian

38:57.251 --> 38:59.420
-People love a 'stache.
-[Tan] They do.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.922
He's putting on my favorite blazer.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.176
-[Antoni] Is it purple? Is it a mauve?
-It's got a lilac thread

39:05.259 --> 39:07.219
that runs through it, which is beautiful.

39:07.928 --> 39:09.388
-Ta-da!
-[all cheering]

39:09.472 --> 39:11.432
-Hi.
-Yeah.

39:11.515 --> 39:12.975

39:15.644 --> 39:18.314
-He looks confident, which I love.
-Bye-bye.

39:18.397 --> 39:21.817
-Madame, let's go.
-Mm. I'm so excited.

39:21.901 --> 39:25.196
He'll fit into that Parent-Teacher Mixer
like you can't even imagine.

39:25.279 --> 39:28.157
-How are you doing?
-Well, happy to be here.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.617
Well, here we go.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.870
You mix and mingle. Enjoy.

39:32.953 --> 39:35.122
[chattering]

39:40.586 --> 39:43.214
-You gotta do it.
-There you go, yeah.

39:43.297 --> 39:45.341
[Karamo]
Look how Leo is greeting the other dads.

39:45.424 --> 39:48.135
-Like, look.
-We don't do handshakes anymore.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.513
There's no more handshakes.
How you doing?

39:50.596 --> 39:53.641
See, he's not gonna have that fear.
It's like he's at the bar.

39:53.724 --> 39:57.103
Welcome to our first Parent-Teacher Mixer
of the school year.

39:57.186 --> 39:59.730
-Oh, yeah. One of many.
-Mix, mingle and enjoy.

39:59.814 --> 40:03.150
I see what you guys do with the kids,
and they're growing fast.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.652
They're doing great things.

40:04.735 --> 40:05.569
Cheers.

40:06.612 --> 40:10.950
She knows that I read to, uh, Sebastian,
so she grabs the book

40:11.033 --> 40:13.285
and is like, "Read to me,"
and I'm like, "Okay."

40:13.744 --> 40:16.038
-Let's set up mani-pedis.
-[Leo] Yeah, man.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.666
They have places where you can even drink.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.586
I just loved how he's engaging
with other parents.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.339
-[Bethany] I'm so proud of you.
-Okay.

40:25.423 --> 40:29.385
I'm glad you took it to heart.
I see the change, and I love it.

40:29.468 --> 40:30.761
And you look amazing.

40:32.304 --> 40:35.474
I did it for you guys.
This is like step number one.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.392
Yes.

40:36.851 --> 40:39.228
[Tan] I really think
that he's going to shine

40:39.311 --> 40:42.982
and is gonna be able to take onboard
the lessons we've taught him.

40:43.065 --> 40:46.986
[Karamo] Leo now has the confidence
to connect with other parents, his wife,

40:47.069 --> 40:49.155
and know that he's not alone
in this journey.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.615
It's easy to compare yourself
to other people.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.952
At the end of the day,
a dad who provides for his family

40:55.035 --> 40:58.289
and has a happy home, that's success.

40:58.372 --> 41:01.000
-To Leo.
-To Leo.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.879
-He did so good.
-To being a confident father.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.465
[Jonathan] He did so good.

41:07.965 --> 41:10.301
Just don't stop, don't stop pushing me.

41:10.843 --> 41:13.554
-Sometimes I need that.
-I'm gonna push you.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.055
Stop pushing.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.348
[laughing]

41:27.818 --> 41:30.196
A slim fit jean is for everybody.

41:30.279 --> 41:33.324
It's tapered at the leg,
so it's gonna make you look longer

41:33.407 --> 41:35.951
and leaner,
no matter what is going on here.
