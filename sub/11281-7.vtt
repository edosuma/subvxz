EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #052
"Everybody Hates Houseguests"
CLOSED CAPTIONED

00:06.474 --> 00:08.176
Hey, Greg, what's up?

00:08.209 --> 00:10.211
My father's going
out of town for a week.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.612
I have to stay
with my grandmother.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.214
I'm not looking forward
to it.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.248
Why not?

00:14.282 --> 00:17.618
Left, right, left knee,
right, left, right...

00:17.651 --> 00:21.089
Anyways,
I'll catch you later.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.156
CHRIS ROCK:
For most of my life,

00:22.190 --> 00:24.425
I'd never had a friend
stay over at my house...

00:24.458 --> 00:25.726
Hey, Greg.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.361
...mostly because
I didn't have a friend,

00:27.395 --> 00:29.630
and we already had too many
people in our house.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.499
You want to just come
stay at my house?

00:31.532 --> 00:32.766
Are you serious?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.735
That'd be totally awesome.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.737
Yeah, all I have to
do is ask my mom.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.206
Boy, are you crazy?!

00:38.239 --> 00:39.307
And why are you just

00:39.340 --> 00:40.341
springing this up on me?!

00:40.374 --> 00:41.542
So he can't
come stay with us?

00:41.575 --> 00:43.477
Well, baby, it's just
that I'm at work,

00:43.511 --> 00:45.746
and I don't have time
to get ready for company.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.283
Okay, all right,
Greg can stay,

00:49.317 --> 00:50.618
but just tell him don't expect

00:50.651 --> 00:52.220
anything special.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.555
* Our house,
in the middle of our street *

00:54.588 --> 00:57.191
I'm warning you, man,
don't expect anything special.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.693
Don't worry, dude,
I'm just happy to be here.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.296
Hello, Greg!
Hors d'oeuvre?

01:02.330 --> 01:05.233
If this isn't special,
I'd hate to see her overdo it.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.335
Come, eat.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.670
Help! My mother is possessed
by a nice lady.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.348
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.342
Now, wait a minute.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.678
You know we say
grace every night.

01:50.711 --> 01:51.812
No, we don't.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.347
Yes, we do.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.348
Now, shut up and bless the food.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.317
If I didn't thank the Lord
at the table,

01:56.350 --> 01:59.253
my mother was going to send me
to thank him in person.

01:59.287 --> 02:02.356
Dear Lord, bless this food
that we are thankful to receive.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.424
Amen.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.558
ALL:
Amen.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.394
What kind of food is this?

02:06.427 --> 02:07.528
GREG:
Vegetarian.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.298
My stomach has a lot of trouble
breaking down enzymes.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.366
I didn't know you could buy
vegetarian fatback.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.667
JULIUS:
It's not bad.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.803
Hey, pass the big piece
of vegetable.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.371
Do we have to eat this?

02:17.405 --> 02:18.539
If you want to eat here.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.907
Hey, Drew,

02:19.940 --> 02:21.108
thanks for giving me your bed.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.344
But if you want me to sleep on
the couch instead of you,

02:23.377 --> 02:24.412
I understand.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.215
Oh, no way. Now I have
the TV to myself at night.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.350
Julius, do you want me to make
you an extra plate for work?

02:29.383 --> 02:31.352
Oh, that'd be great,
baby. Thank you.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.321
Work? It's nighttime.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.423
He works at night.
And days.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.657
My dad has two jobs.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.193
Make that three. I just picked
up a side job driving a cab.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.362
A cab? When do you have time
to drive a cab?

02:41.395 --> 02:42.930
I'm just trying it
for the weekend.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.198
I'll see how it goes.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.367
Wow. When do you sleep?

02:48.469 --> 02:49.570
Hey, that's a good one.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.240
Sleep.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.474
Greg brought so much stuff,

02:53.507 --> 02:57.411
I couldn't tell if he was
staying over or taking over.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.580
You're wearing
Transformers pajamas?

02:59.613 --> 03:00.814
Man, you're 15.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.850
I like to pray
as different characters.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.718
That way, God doesn't get bored
with me.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.919
Tonight, I'm Optimus Prime,

03:05.953 --> 03:08.489
leader of the Autobots.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.493
:
Now I lay me down
to sleep,

03:12.526 --> 03:16.697
pray the Lord my
soul to keep. Amen.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.500
He should pray
for some self-esteem.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.579
Good night, man.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.714
I can't tell you
how great it is being here.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.483
No problem. Night.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.523
The snoring actually
wasn't that bad

03:42.556 --> 03:44.325
compared to what followed.

03:44.358 --> 03:48.396
* She's a maniac, maniac
on the floor *

03:48.429 --> 03:52.400
* And she's dancing like
she's never danced before *

03:52.433 --> 03:54.768
I was hoping a maniac
would break in

03:54.802 --> 03:56.870
and smother Greg with a pillow.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.972
Greg was driving me
up the wall,

03:59.006 --> 04:02.276
and my dad was about
to get taken for a ride.

04:09.517 --> 04:10.484
Where to?

04:10.518 --> 04:11.652
Las Vegas.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.321
Seriously, man, where to?

04:13.354 --> 04:14.422
Las Vegas, Nevada.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.557
Man, you crazy--
get out of my cab.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.591
Hey, no, seriously,
brother,

04:17.625 --> 04:19.793
I really need
to get to Las Vegas.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.363
Look, I cannot take you
to Las Vegas!

04:22.396 --> 04:24.798
Would you take me to Las Vegas
for a thousand dollars?

04:24.832 --> 04:27.368
For a thousand dollars,
he'd take you to South Africa

04:27.401 --> 04:28.936
during the height of apartheid.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.538
Just let me call my wife.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.772
To say good-bye.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.443
(zany sound effects
playing on TV)

04:35.476 --> 04:38.045
Hey, you guys, your
cereal is on the table.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.981
Okay, here we go, Greg.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.683
Egg white frittata,

04:42.716 --> 04:44.552
honeydew melon
and dry wheat toast.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.620
Thanks. This looks delicious.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.955
Why's he get all this?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.757
'Cause our regular food
would kill him.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.998
Hello.
Rochelle, it's me.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.468
Listen, I won't be home
for dinner tonight.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.035
I have to take a passenger
to Vegas.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.103
Vegas?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.538
Julius, are you crazy?

05:04.572 --> 05:05.606
What about your regular job?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.508
I have a few sick days
I can use.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.543
I'll be back
by the end of the week.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.645
Julius, you are not driving
that cab to Vegas.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.481
The guy's
gonna pay me

05:13.514 --> 05:14.582
a thousand dollars.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.083
Get me Wayne Newton's autograph.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.051
Bye.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.588
While my father set off
for Sin City,

05:20.621 --> 05:24.425
I showed Greg aroundthe
original sin city,Bed-Stuy.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.460
I can't decide on a hairstyle.

05:26.494 --> 05:29.563
I'm stuck between
Verdine White and Dr. J.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.698
I cannot cut your hair, Greg.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.433
Why not?

05:32.466 --> 05:34.902
First of all, your hair's not
long enough to be Verdine White,

05:34.935 --> 05:36.837
and it's not curly enough
to be Dr. J.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.506
I've never used these scissors
on straight hair.

05:38.539 --> 05:39.740
I don't know what will happen.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.008
I'll start cutting
your hair, man,

05:41.041 --> 05:43.477
sparks start flying everywhere,
your whole head catch on fire.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.113
And I will not be sued
by white people!

05:46.146 --> 05:48.716
Listen here, I got
the perfect shirt

05:48.749 --> 05:50.551
for your haircut, huh?

05:50.584 --> 05:51.952
Five dollars.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.387
This has a hole in it.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.656
That's not a hole.
It's distressed.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.625
Guys in Manhattan
pay top dollar for this.

05:57.658 --> 06:01.028
In fact, a distressed man
got shot in that shirt.

06:03.664 --> 06:04.465
Hey,

06:04.498 --> 06:06.800
little dude
from across the street.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.436
Who this?

06:08.469 --> 06:09.670
It's my friend Greg.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.739
He's staying at my house
for a few days.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.574
Hey, little white dude
staying across the street,

06:13.607 --> 06:14.642
let me hold a dollar.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.513
Nice shirt.

06:19.547 --> 06:22.683
Risky got the shirt
from Jerome.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.652
Hey, I just
got a nickname.

06:24.685 --> 06:27.187
Hey, you just got robbed.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.657
Cool!

06:35.629 --> 06:37.898
That's what
I'm talking about.

06:37.931 --> 06:41.602
Hey, I hate to hold us up,
but I am starving.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.504
You hungry?

06:43.537 --> 06:45.473
It's on me.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.707
If you're paying, he's eating.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.041
I could eat.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.578
I'll go and get
some food.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.712
You keep the car running.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.987
I should call Rochelle.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.622
He should call the cops.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.899
She did not just leave a mint
on Greg's pillow!

07:16.570 --> 07:17.905
Hey. Hey, man,
what are you doing?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.007
I thought I told you
to wait in the car.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.008
I'm calling my wife.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.175
I haven't talked
to her all day.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.712
Do you want $1,000 or do you
want to talk to your wife?

07:24.745 --> 07:27.047
Nobody had to ask my father
that question twice.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.816
Let's go.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.719
Today in Ohio, an armed fugitive
makes another stop

07:31.752 --> 07:33.687
on his cross-country wave
of terror.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.989
Will police catch him
before he strikes again?

07:36.023 --> 07:37.725
Find out at 11:00.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.027
Hey, man,
where you been?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.129
Washing your dishes.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.498
What are you doing?

07:44.532 --> 07:45.766
Turning to MacGyver.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.501
But I wanted to watch NOVA.

07:47.535 --> 07:50.003
NOVA

07:50.037 --> 07:53.006
It's a show on PBS about science
as it relates to the universe.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.842
Cool. That's almost
like MacGyver.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.644
Just like Lawrence Welk
is like Soul Train.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.846
Chris, Greg is your guest.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.514
Let him watch NOVA.

08:00.548 --> 08:01.882
Gelato?

08:01.915 --> 08:03.250
Is that Italian for Jell

08:03.283 --> 08:04.151
Thanks.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.185
I thought having

08:05.218 --> 08:06.787
Greg stay over would be fun.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.121
Probably what
the Indians thought

08:08.155 --> 08:09.256
when they first saw Columbus.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.659
ANNOUNCER:
Next on NOVA...

08:16.764 --> 08:20.701
DEEJAY:
WEBW 1020 news time 5:00 a.m.

08:20.734 --> 08:24.071
The search continues across
America for the taxicab bandit.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.806
The suspect...

08:25.839 --> 08:27.675
Greg was an only child,

08:27.708 --> 08:29.076
and he was afraid
to sleep alone

08:29.109 --> 08:31.979
so he dressed as superheroes
to scare the boogeyman.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.883
Greg, get up.
Time to go.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.851
What time is it?

08:37.885 --> 08:41.221
5:00 a.m.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.056
5:00 a.m.?

08:43.090 --> 08:46.259
We don't have to be to school
for another three hours.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.061
Yeah, but if we don't hurry,
we'll miss the first bus.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.163
First

08:50.197 --> 08:53.066
Three, plus a little
bit of a walk.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.302
Greg was going to have to walk
a mile in my shoes.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.870
How long of a walk?

08:56.904 --> 08:58.806
About a mile.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.777
GREG:
* Keep smiling, keep shining

09:03.811 --> 09:07.047
* Knowing you can always
count on me *

09:07.080 --> 09:08.949
Greg, hurry up!
I need to get in!

09:08.982 --> 09:10.718
* That's what
friends are for... *

09:10.751 --> 09:13.687
Chris, would you shut up?! Dang!

09:13.721 --> 09:15.956
* Keep shining,
knowing you can... *

09:15.989 --> 09:17.090
Boy, what is
your problem?

09:17.124 --> 09:18.792
I need to go to the bathroom.

09:18.826 --> 09:19.927
Well, you bang
on that door again

09:19.960 --> 09:22.830
and I'm gonna knock out
whatever you're holding in!

09:28.235 --> 09:29.703
Hey, good morning,
Julius.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.704
How'd you sleep?

09:30.738 --> 09:31.672
Like a baby, Eddie.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.941
Do you mind if I make
a quick phone call?

09:33.974 --> 09:34.808
Sure, sure, I don't mind.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.276
You think you can have
the car running

09:36.309 --> 09:37.711
and ready to go in five minutes?

09:37.745 --> 09:38.846
Sure thing.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.080
All right,
I'm just gonna collect

09:40.113 --> 09:41.314
the deposit for the rooms back.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.783
Okay.
All right.

09:42.816 --> 09:46.019
Not just his deposit,
everybody's deposit.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.057
Operator.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.659
I'd like to make a collect call.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.693
My father had a system

09:52.726 --> 09:54.862
to beat the high price
of calling collect.

09:54.895 --> 09:55.829
Hello?

09:55.863 --> 09:57.631
You have a collect call from...
Daddy fine.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.799
Nebraska cornfields.
Chris garbage. Hang up.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.734
Would you like to accept?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.302
Collect call
from your father?

10:02.335 --> 10:03.904
Yeah. He's doing fine.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.906
He's in Nebraska, and the
cornfields are pretty,

10:05.939 --> 10:08.709
and Chris should
remember to take out
the garbage.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.878
Okay.
Eventually, the phone company

10:10.911 --> 10:13.180
started hanging up
on my father.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.815
Back at school,
Greg was catching up

10:14.848 --> 10:16.283
on more than his studies.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.952
What year did the American
Revolution begin?

10:18.986 --> 10:20.821
Greg. Greg?!

10:20.854 --> 10:22.790
1942.

10:22.823 --> 10:23.991
Greg, what's wrong with you?

10:24.024 --> 10:25.693
You're usually so alert.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.661
It's because he's staying
at my house for the week.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.897
Oh, my God, he's drunk?!

10:29.930 --> 10:32.265
Did he have a 40 for breakfast?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.433
I'm not drunk.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.836
I'm just not used
to getting up so early.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.805
Don't be ashamed-- Chris's
people have a history

10:37.838 --> 10:40.974
of being up when the
rooster crows to go
to work in the fields.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.977
Who could expect
you to keep up?

10:44.011 --> 10:45.145
Go back to sleep.

10:45.178 --> 10:48.415
She was Don Imus in a dress.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.317
After school,
Greg was doing his homework

10:50.350 --> 10:51.985
while I was doing my work work.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.054
Okay, now, Doc left some
instructions for you, Chris.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.289
Now, get all the merchandise
out of all these boxes

10:56.323 --> 10:57.791
and stock the shelves
with them, okay?

10:57.825 --> 11:01.862
Now, all the empty boxes
need to be broken down and
cut up into small pieces

11:01.895 --> 11:05.332
and thrown into the Dumpster
behind the Chinese place
when Mr. Hoo isn't looking.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.902
Now, when that's done,
you can start your work.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.337
Hey, uh, Greg,
you need anything?

11:10.370 --> 11:12.439
Soda

11:12.472 --> 11:14.074
No, thanks.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.877
How come you don't do your
homework like that, Chris?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.412
Because I'm too busy
cutting up boxes.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.915
Meanwhile, my father
had turned into Al Cowlings,

11:21.949 --> 11:23.383
and he didn't even know it.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.118
Hey, you might want
to slow down.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.120
They love pulling people over
on roads like these.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.289
If you're black,
they like to pull you over

11:29.322 --> 11:30.490
coming out of your driveway.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.026
I-I think we need
to stop for gas soon.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.962
Have you seen the
price of gas lately?

11:34.995 --> 11:35.963
It's highway robbery.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.065
Highway robbery?

11:38.098 --> 11:39.733
What's that supposed to mean?

11:39.767 --> 11:41.835
I mean, gas is
costing me a fortune.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.271
:
Oh. That's what you mean.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.273
Here, I'll pay
for the last fill-up.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.875
A twenty?

11:47.908 --> 11:50.310
Keep the change.
Thanks, man.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.012
If my father
was allowed to see

11:52.045 --> 11:54.214
the price of gas today,
it would kill him.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.150
Now, why are you in such a
rush to get to Vegas anyway?

11:57.184 --> 11:59.452
One reason.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.956
Karen.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.959
We were together...
but I lost her.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.828
Well, what happened?

12:07.861 --> 12:09.296
It's a long story.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.998
I made some mistakes,

12:11.031 --> 12:14.134
and now I have to go back
and tell Karen I love her

12:14.167 --> 12:15.168
and get her back.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.905
Well, I hope it all
works out for you, Eddie.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.807
Not to be nosy,

12:19.840 --> 12:22.542
but you've got cash--
why don't you just fly to Vegas?

12:22.575 --> 12:25.345
Oh, um, I'm, um...

12:25.378 --> 12:27.114
I'm claustrophobic.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.017
Not to mention truth-ophobic.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.789
Oh, Chris, your dad
wanted to remind you

12:35.823 --> 12:37.090
to take the garbage out.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.092
Already did.
What's wrong, baby?

12:39.126 --> 12:40.828
Well, Ma, it's just that...

12:40.861 --> 12:41.962
No, not you, baby.

12:41.995 --> 12:42.996
I was talking to Greg.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.164
What's wrong?

12:44.197 --> 12:47.334
I had to get up so early,

12:47.367 --> 12:49.069
and it took so long
to get to school,

12:49.102 --> 12:51.004
I feel a little rundown.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.439
Oh, well, I'm sorry
you feel that way, Greg.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.307
You want Chris
to run you a hot bath?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.309
A hot bath? She wouldn't
let me use hot water

12:56.343 --> 12:58.011
to make hot water.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.980
I am not running him a bath.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.048
Chris, be nice, okay?

13:01.081 --> 13:02.883
Greg has had a long day.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.517
Um, that's okay.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.319
It's about time for bed.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.889
Okay. Well,
good night, boys.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.927
What's wrong with you?

13:13.961 --> 13:16.997
You had the same day as me--
and I had school and work--

13:17.030 --> 13:18.932
so why are you so tired?

13:18.966 --> 13:20.533
It's not like
I do this every day.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.369
Exactly.
If you got treated like me,

13:22.402 --> 13:24.237
you wouldn't last two seconds.
Hey, man,

13:24.271 --> 13:26.106
at least you have
a little help around here.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.141
Most of the time, I have
to get by on my own.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.978
Oh, yeah, with your own room,
your own TV, your own allowance.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.980
You know what,
you're being really immature.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.347
I'm being immature?

13:34.381 --> 13:36.216
Man, you're the one going to bed
dressed as Superman.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.920
No. I'm going to bed
dressed as Clark Kent.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.054
What I'm trying to say is,

13:41.088 --> 13:43.023
you've been here
for the past four days,

13:43.056 --> 13:44.992
and I'm getting tired
of doing everything for you.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.327
You know what? Nobody asked you
to do anything for me.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.462
I don't want you
to do anything for me.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.099
At least that way, I won't
have to hear your mouth.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.867
Cool.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.135
Cool!

14:03.343 --> 14:05.012
Good morning, baby.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.546
Where's Greg?
His frittata's ready.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.148
Oh, upstairs.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.216
Oh, well, I got to go, okay?

14:09.249 --> 14:11.484
So make sure you clean off
the table and lock up,

14:11.518 --> 14:14.021
'cause I got to be in early,
and tell Greg I said bye.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.255
Okay.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.393
Bye.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.030
Since Greg didn't want me
to do anything,

14:23.063 --> 14:26.066
that's exactly what I did.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.911
Why didn't you wake me up?

14:37.945 --> 14:40.080
You told me you didn't
want me to do anything
for you, so I didn't.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.150
That didn't mean I wanted you
to let me sleep through school.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.952
I missed the quarterly
history test!

14:44.985 --> 14:47.154
Well, maybe you should've gone
to bed dressed as Superman.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.389
That way you could've
flown to school.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.391
Good thing
he doesn't have heat vision.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.031
SINATRA:
* She's got friends

14:58.065 --> 15:00.100
* By the dozens...
This is it.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.201
Yeah, this is it.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.436
And...

15:03.470 --> 15:05.205
here's your thousand dollars.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.140
Oh.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.641
Julius, I really want
to thank you

15:08.675 --> 15:10.110
for getting
me out of a jam.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.212
A ten-to-20-year jam.

15:12.245 --> 15:16.049
Boy... it's been so long
since I've seen Karen.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.484
I really hope I'm doing
the right thing.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.618
Well, do you love her?

15:18.651 --> 15:20.053
Without a doubt.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.088
Well, then you're
doing the right thing.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.289
You know,

15:22.322 --> 15:24.424
I got a good feeling
about you and Karen.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.326
(sirens wailing,
tires screech)

15:26.359 --> 15:27.694
Hey! Wha...?

15:27.727 --> 15:29.596
JULIUS:
Hey, wh

15:29.629 --> 15:31.198
Come out with your hands up!

15:31.231 --> 15:33.666
Look, before you picked me up,
I robbed a bank.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.767
Robbed a bank?!
Yeah,

15:34.801 --> 15:36.669
and every other place we stopped
since we left Jersey.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.071
What are you doing, man?!

15:38.105 --> 15:40.007
I'm sorry it had to come
to this, Julius,

15:40.040 --> 15:41.241
but I cannot go back to jail.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.642
You'll never take me alive!

15:42.675 --> 15:45.178
No, no, no, no, no!
Take me alive!

15:45.212 --> 15:47.981
Please, take me alive!
Out of the cab!

15:48.015 --> 15:51.018
Back home, Greg and I were
having our own standoff...

15:51.051 --> 15:54.054
minus the guns
and the masculinity.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.690
Okay, what's going on
between you two?

15:57.724 --> 15:58.591
Ask him.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.359
Chris?

15:59.392 --> 16:00.460
I didn't do a thing.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.594
You didn't wake me up!

16:01.628 --> 16:03.130
You didn't wake him up?

16:03.163 --> 16:04.231
Man, that's wrong.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.732
Who asked you?
Excuse me,

16:05.765 --> 16:07.500
I can handle this.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.202
You didn't wake him up?
That's wrong.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.537
Well, nobody
wakes me up.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.439
Nobody puts chocolate
on my pillow.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.508
If I took a half-hour
shower singing "That's
What Friends Are For,"

16:15.542 --> 16:17.444
and you had to pee,
you would smack the crack

16:17.477 --> 16:18.578
out of my behind.
Okay, watch yourself, boy.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.213
If you didn't
want me to be here,

16:20.247 --> 16:21.081
why'd you even invite me?
If you don't

16:21.114 --> 16:22.615
want to be here,
why don't you just go?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.117
Maybe I will.
See ya.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.118
Fine.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.019
I want to call

16:26.053 --> 16:28.188
my grandmother--
may I use your phone?

16:28.221 --> 16:29.289
Sure, Greg.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.294
Chris, what is wrong with you?

16:34.327 --> 16:37.264
I live here, and you're
treating him better than me.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.766
Okay.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.035
Baby, Greg is your guest, okay?

16:42.069 --> 16:45.172
I been doing stuff
for him for one week

16:45.205 --> 16:46.106
because he's your friend.

16:46.139 --> 16:49.176
I've been doing stuff
for you for 15 years

16:49.209 --> 16:51.078
because you're my son, okay?

16:51.111 --> 16:53.113
Don't ever forget that.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.283
She wasn't home.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.584
Oh, yes, she was.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.122
One, two, three, wah!

17:02.155 --> 17:04.557
One, two, three, wah!

17:04.591 --> 17:06.793
Meanwhile in Las Vegas,
my father rolled the dice

17:06.826 --> 17:08.328
trying to reason
with a madman.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.063
Eddie, you got
to give up, man.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.665
The cops are gonna
start shooting.
Oh, I got a plan for that.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.966
I'm gonna use
your body as a shield.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.670
WOMAN :
Eddie? Eddie,
are you there, honey?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.339
Karen?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.807
I love you, Eddie!

17:20.840 --> 17:22.309
Karen...

17:22.342 --> 17:23.776
I love you, Eddie!

17:23.810 --> 17:25.812
Karen, I love you, too, baby,
I love you!

17:25.845 --> 17:28.181
Eddie, please give up!

17:28.215 --> 17:30.817
Please, do it for me, Eddie!
MAN:
She's right!

17:30.850 --> 17:33.653
:
Okay. All right.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.255
I give up!

17:36.656 --> 17:37.724
I give up! All right!

17:37.757 --> 17:39.626
Get out of the cab!
He's coming out!

17:39.659 --> 17:41.628
I give up!

17:41.661 --> 17:43.763
That's the first time a woman
Karen!

17:43.796 --> 17:46.199
ever made a man
put a gun down.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.167
Here you go, Officer.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.602
I know you need
to take this in as evidence.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.304
Freeze!
You're under arrest.

17:51.338 --> 17:54.307
No, they need to take you in
as evidence.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.343
After a week
of doing things for Greg,

17:56.376 --> 18:00.213
the hardest thing was something
I had to do for myself.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.281
You asleep?

18:01.314 --> 18:03.450
I'm not talking to you.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.218
But if I were talking to you,

18:05.252 --> 18:08.388
I'd tell you how angry I am
because of what you did.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.356
Look, I'm sorry.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.391
But you know how tired
you were last night?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.160
That's how tired I am
every night.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.363
But I don't get to cry about it,
I just got to deal with it.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.231
You don't have it so hard.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.499
How do you figure that?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.234
So you live in Bed-Stuy,

18:21.268 --> 18:23.436
it takes you three hours
to get to school,

18:23.470 --> 18:24.871
and you have
an after-school job.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.606
So what?
I wish I had someone

18:26.639 --> 18:28.808
to fight over the TV
or bathroom with.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.211
The last thing my mother
cooked on the stove

18:31.244 --> 18:32.479
got her a year of probation.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.382
I don't do everything
on my own because I want to.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.350
I do it 'cause I have to.

18:37.384 --> 18:40.187
Dang, I guess I never
thought of it like that.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.855
Sorry, man, I didn't mean
to be such a pain.
Aw, forget it.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.291
I'll tell Ms. Morello
what happened,

18:44.324 --> 18:46.459
and maybe she'll let you
take a make-up exam.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.894
You think?
Yeah.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.497
I'll just tell her that
you drank a 40 by accident.

18:50.530 --> 18:54.234
By the time Greg left my house,
he really felt at home.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.835
Little white dude
about to go home.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.870
Let me hold a dollar.
Sure.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.608
See ya.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.377
Hey, if you need pants
to go with that shirt,

19:04.411 --> 19:05.712
I can tighten you up.
Sorry,

19:05.745 --> 19:06.879
but I just got robbed.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.581
Oh. Well, maybe next time.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.716
Yeah.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.284
See ya.
Greg!

19:11.318 --> 19:14.254
Hurry up before we get shot!

19:14.287 --> 19:16.523
See you at school, man.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.329
Take care, Greg.
See ya, dude.

19:24.964 --> 19:28.735
* We are family
Why didn't you tell me
they were Negroes?

19:28.768 --> 19:31.438
It's okay, but I would've
appreciated a little warning.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.340
I always thought
that Greg was lucky

19:33.373 --> 19:36.809
because he had lots of toys,
a nice allowance and freedom.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.480
But Greg showed me that I had
the most important thing

19:40.513 --> 19:42.615
a person can have: a family.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.317
Oh! Oh, ooh, ooh.

19:44.351 --> 19:47.220
I need to draw you
a bath. Yeah.
Yeah.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.323
After Greg was gone,
I actually kind of missed him.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.591
* We are family

19:51.624 --> 19:52.892
How was your trip, baby?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.394
That's a long story.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.329
* Get up, everybody, and sing

19:56.363 --> 19:57.864
So how was it
having Greg over?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.966
Cool. Can he stay over
again sometime?

19:59.999 --> 20:02.235
Are you nuts?

20:02.269 --> 20:05.338
I never worked so hard
in my entire life.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.940
And I want my bed back.
And she is not making me eat
no more tofu.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.745
Whoa, you gave
your brother's bed to Greg?

20:12.779 --> 20:14.814
And you sit up here washing
dishes for the white man!

20:14.847 --> 20:16.916
And that little TV show NOVA
was boring!

20:16.949 --> 20:19.586
I'm tired of being a
vegetarian short-order cook!

20:19.619 --> 20:22.589
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:22.622 --> 20:26.326
