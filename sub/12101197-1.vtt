00:38.357 --> 00:39.757
What do you got for me?

00:46.857 --> 00:49.291
This is real Malana Charas.

00:54.223 --> 00:55.290
The best hashish in India.

01:05.723 --> 01:06.657
You wanna try this?

01:09.256 --> 01:11.224
It's called Bulu,
it's from Africa.

01:14.424 --> 01:16.624
Upper, downer, psychedelic?

01:19.924 --> 01:23.656
They say it makes you see
the future.

05:49.455 --> 05:50.490
Dada!

06:55.523 --> 06:59.790
♪ La la la la la la
la la la la la la ♪

07:22.290 --> 07:24.422
Fuck!

07:24.456 --> 07:25.657
Let go!

07:25.690 --> 07:28.557
- Fuck you.
- What happened, man?

07:30.390 --> 07:31.557
You tell me!

07:32.455 --> 07:33.824
They must have framed you.

07:33.856 --> 07:37.256
I have no idea what's
happening here, man, no idea.

07:40.490 --> 07:42.491
Tell me more about this
Bulu shit you gave me.

07:44.289 --> 07:46.857
It's a new thing, no
one even knows about it.

07:46.890 --> 07:49.190
I can see things
before they happen,

07:49.222 --> 07:50.423
how the fuck is that possible?

07:50.456 --> 07:51.457
- I don't know!
- I knew you were gonna

07:51.489 --> 07:52.323
be at this temple!

07:53.857 --> 07:54.657
- Come on, man give me
- Fuck.

07:54.690 --> 07:55.590
a fucking answer.

07:55.622 --> 07:56.689
It's a sample I gave to you.

07:56.722 --> 07:58.523
I haven't even tried it, please.

08:02.490 --> 08:04.824
So where does it come from, huh?

08:04.856 --> 08:06.623
Who's the connect?

08:06.657 --> 08:08.657
A Rasta guy from
Uganda gave it to me,

08:09.423 --> 08:11.591
It's a place called
Fort Lugard, okay?

08:13.489 --> 08:15.590
Fort Lugard, Uganda.

08:19.490 --> 08:20.624
Give me his number.

08:23.620 --> 08:24.623
I haven't seen him in a month.

08:24.656 --> 08:25.590
I swear, I haven't
seen him in a month.

08:25.623 --> 08:27.390
I don't have his number, okay?

08:41.556 --> 08:42.856
Fuck!

09:17.590 --> 09:18.424
Dada!

09:28.656 --> 09:30.557
Hey it's Bobby babam.

09:32.623 --> 09:34.524
Do you remember this?

09:34.556 --> 09:36.890
Yeah, yeah.

09:46.923 --> 09:48.689
Bobby?

09:48.723 --> 09:50.190
Come here, Bobby.

09:56.190 --> 09:57.791
Bobby come in here at once.

10:01.290 --> 10:02.690
- Go, Bobby.
- Do as I say, Bobby.

10:02.723 --> 10:03.557
It's okay.

10:04.923 --> 10:06.757
I love you.

10:16.589 --> 10:18.789
Do you have money or no?

10:18.823 --> 10:20.456
I need two more weeks.

10:24.690 --> 10:25.524
Fuck.

10:27.924 --> 10:31.257
Bobby, I love you.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.689
Yeah, go on, you're all right.

11:20.956 --> 11:21.858
Fuck you!

11:36.423 --> 11:39.256
- Wagwan in the area!
- Yes, yes Hugo!

11:40.756 --> 11:42.389
What happened in India, bro?

11:43.420 --> 11:44.422
Your phone's been off.

11:46.222 --> 11:48.322
Total fucking disaster man.

11:48.356 --> 11:51.190
We lost everything.

11:51.222 --> 11:52.456
You what?

11:52.489 --> 11:54.556
Matt's gonna fucking
break your legs.

11:55.689 --> 11:56.689
He's cool.

11:56.723 --> 11:58.290
No, Hugo, he ain't cool.

11:58.323 --> 11:59.691
How are you gonna pay him back?

12:02.923 --> 12:05.290
It's not my fucking
problem we were busted.

12:05.322 --> 12:07.356
You're
joking, aren't you?

12:07.390 --> 12:10.923
You just lost 10
grand of his money.

12:10.955 --> 12:13.457
10 grand is nothing,
I've found the future.

12:14.756 --> 12:16.789
This better be fucking good man.

12:16.822 --> 12:19.589
What do you
know about Uganda?

12:19.623 --> 12:21.890
What about Uganda, you're
just gonna waltz in there

12:21.923 --> 12:24.124
and get it off Idi Amin.

12:24.955 --> 12:25.922
Here, spark this up.

12:31.690 --> 12:34.590
All right, all right, all right!

12:34.623 --> 12:37.823
What the fuck!

13:17.456 --> 13:20.223
You two boys been having
a good time, have you?

13:21.456 --> 13:22.724
Always more fun

13:23.723 --> 13:25.224
on other peoples money,

13:27.789 --> 13:28.623
isn't it?

13:29.556 --> 13:32.822
I'm sorry, I just,
there's a new connect.

13:32.855 --> 13:36.222
I've got this drug, all right?

13:36.255 --> 13:39.623
This drug from Africa,

13:39.656 --> 13:41.222
he fucking...

13:41.255 --> 13:42.590
Man this shit.

13:42.623 --> 13:43.923
Like you fucking
see your future.

13:43.955 --> 13:45.656
It's like a fucking movie.

13:46.888 --> 13:48.257
He's chatting shit.

13:48.290 --> 13:50.724
I'm not fucking kidding,
it's fucking insane.

13:50.756 --> 13:54.790
In that case, how do you
propose to wriggle out of this?

13:54.822 --> 13:58.156
I go to Africa, I
get you your drugs

13:58.189 --> 14:00.256
and then we all live
happily ever after.

14:19.889 --> 14:21.590
All right, Hugo,

14:22.589 --> 14:24.356
you got to Africa

14:24.389 --> 14:26.556
and you get me this fairy dust.

14:27.789 --> 14:29.289
You got two weeks.

14:36.589 --> 14:39.788
You are a cheeky fucker, Hugo.

14:39.821 --> 14:41.857
There are worse things
to be my friend.

20:43.323 --> 20:45.322
We've been the authority.

20:45.356 --> 20:46.890
Half, half, that's fair.

20:46.923 --> 20:49.289
True that, half for
me half for Pape.

20:49.323 --> 20:50.589
Pape!

20:50.622 --> 20:52.389
You don't still
work for that loser.

20:53.789 --> 20:56.856
They're a team and a
wounded lion is dangerous.

20:56.888 --> 20:59.755
Fine, let him have it
all and be done with it.

21:03.255 --> 21:05.290
So you keep all the
good stuff in here?

21:07.322 --> 21:08.689
Ras, I've got to survive.

21:09.855 --> 21:11.523
What does he want
to do, Kill me?

21:15.521 --> 21:17.756
He's a gentleman,
he takes his time.

21:53.489 --> 21:54.389
The last time I was in Makaana,

21:54.423 --> 21:57.222
I was caught between
Pastor Isaac groping me

21:57.256 --> 21:59.389
and Auntie Betty calling
me the devils whore.

22:00.555 --> 22:01.355
Fine.

22:05.588 --> 22:08.421
Well, I try to persuade
you to go in to business

22:08.455 --> 22:10.656
with me and Pape but...

22:17.522 --> 22:20.456
A good Christian
never deals drugs.

22:20.488 --> 22:22.723
But the stupid
Rastas never paid us.

22:22.755 --> 22:24.355
They got the Bulu

22:24.388 --> 22:26.855
all the way out to India,
darling, just wait.

22:26.889 --> 22:28.389
I can't wait.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.356
Why not?

22:30.388 --> 22:33.923
Isaac has already started
evicting everyone.

22:33.955 --> 22:36.421
So why should I care?

22:36.455 --> 22:37.289
Angela.

22:42.289 --> 22:43.455
You expect me to help you

22:43.489 --> 22:46.190
when you're going to spend all
that money on a lost cause?

22:58.189 --> 23:01.622
Good luck, this town
is full of surprises,

23:01.655 --> 23:04.355
especially for an innocent
little flower like you.

23:32.955 --> 23:34.189
How's it gentleman?

23:35.455 --> 23:36.623
Get in, I need a drink.

23:38.821 --> 23:40.856
You know any bars
called Holly something?

23:40.888 --> 23:43.124
Let me take you to Hollywood.

23:44.721 --> 23:48.555
♪ It's no accident ♪

23:48.589 --> 23:53.590
♪ And we cheer police chain

23:55.354 --> 23:59.188
♪ 'cause the day I decided

24:19.721 --> 24:24.590
The word mzungu is based
on a Bantu verb muzunga

24:25.755 --> 24:29.255
which means moving
without purpose.

24:29.288 --> 24:30.823
so what exactly
does that have to do

24:30.855 --> 24:32.523
with the white people?

24:32.555 --> 24:35.421
The villagers would ask the
early christian missionaries,

24:35.455 --> 24:38.588
"Hey, where are
you going, father?"

24:38.622 --> 24:40.389
And he would reply and say,

24:40.421 --> 24:43.489
"I'm not going anywhere,
I'm just going for a walk."

24:44.255 --> 24:48.124
Just a little
stroll in the woods.

24:49.655 --> 24:53.856
Henceforth a white man
was Christian mzungu.

24:56.556 --> 24:58.490
The aimless wanderer.

25:00.455 --> 25:03.490
I may be able to help you
find what you're looking for.

25:04.621 --> 25:05.455
I doubt it.

25:13.421 --> 25:15.889
Me have the best
green in Uganda.

25:15.923 --> 25:16.857
High grade.

25:18.489 --> 25:19.422
Green huh?

25:21.555 --> 25:23.555
That's close

25:23.589 --> 25:25.655
but I'm looking
for something new.

25:25.688 --> 25:28.856
Something old, something new

25:29.855 --> 25:31.322
something borrowed.

25:31.354 --> 25:32.389
Something blue.

25:34.589 --> 25:35.490
Come we go talk.

25:54.955 --> 25:57.455
You got a room where
I can try it out?

25:57.489 --> 26:00.389
Yeah man, relax here with
my sister for a while.

26:23.454 --> 26:26.388
I didn't come to
Uganda for that.

26:31.254 --> 26:32.889
Come here.

26:50.555 --> 26:52.455
You deserve more than this wise.

26:55.288 --> 26:56.622
This will show you the way out.

27:04.756 --> 27:06.590
Who can blame you my dear.

27:27.589 --> 27:28.489
Hello.

27:28.522 --> 27:29.388
You've seen that mzungu?

27:29.422 --> 27:30.588
What?

27:30.621 --> 27:32.655
I need the Bulu
from your sister.

27:32.689 --> 27:34.589
You want to talk to my sister?

27:34.622 --> 27:36.322
I'm coming to Hollywood now.

28:40.822 --> 28:41.656
Hugo!

29:03.522 --> 29:04.356
Kisakye!

29:28.288 --> 29:32.656
Hey, I'm a favorite
Rasta man.

29:34.589 --> 29:36.623
Ladies what a pleasure.

29:36.655 --> 29:38.522
This your sister?

29:38.556 --> 29:41.389
My money is inside as cash.

29:41.421 --> 29:42.822
You have the Bulu?

29:42.855 --> 29:44.656
Yeah, we've just got
to go and get it.

29:44.688 --> 29:48.155
No, let's do it now.

29:48.189 --> 29:49.756
I have it here.

29:49.788 --> 29:50.854
Ah, sweetie.

29:50.888 --> 29:53.689
Cool we'll just have to
give the man half an hour.

29:53.722 --> 29:54.789
He's taking a rest.

29:54.821 --> 29:56.822
Let me buy you ladies a drink.

29:56.854 --> 29:58.523
Sweetie,

30:03.887 --> 30:05.556
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

30:05.588 --> 30:07.288
whatagwan here?

30:25.854 --> 30:27.355
You're full of surprises.

30:28.788 --> 30:30.489
See you soon lioness.

30:33.954 --> 30:36.655
Whatever you say
sister, of course.

31:52.921 --> 31:53.889
Oh damn.

31:53.921 --> 31:55.489
London calling?

31:58.589 --> 32:00.256
Whatever it is, it can wait.

32:18.289 --> 32:19.123
Hello.

32:20.288 --> 32:21.323
- Hello.
- Hey,

32:24.821 --> 32:26.856
fancy meeting you here.

32:29.321 --> 32:30.155
Who are you?

32:31.122 --> 32:34.687
Well, you don't know me
yet, but do you mind?

32:34.721 --> 32:35.889
I was leaving anyway.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.523
Will you show me
the blue flowers?

32:50.354 --> 32:53.856
Clearing in the woods and
blue flowers everywhere.

32:55.954 --> 32:57.155
I'm Hugo.

33:00.921 --> 33:01.721
And you are?

33:03.821 --> 33:05.754
I'm Kisakye.

33:05.788 --> 33:07.889
Kisa what?

33:07.922 --> 33:08.755
Kisakye.

33:10.556 --> 33:11.389
Okay.

33:13.322 --> 33:18.288
Look I was right about the
blue flowers, wasn't I?

33:20.821 --> 33:23.590
What exactly do
you want from me?

33:28.755 --> 33:29.822
Half a Kilo of Bulu

33:30.755 --> 33:32.322
as quickly as you can get it.

33:34.620 --> 33:35.621
A thousand dollars

33:36.887 --> 33:38.854
and I'll be back
here in 10 days.

33:38.888 --> 33:40.490
A thousand bucks?

33:42.488 --> 33:45.122
That's a lot of money
for a young lady.

33:51.421 --> 33:53.821
Someone's trying to steal
my father's land but...

33:58.821 --> 34:01.156
I don't know why I'm
telling you this.

34:03.820 --> 34:05.222
I can try and help you.

34:06.887 --> 34:09.654
If you take me to
where you make it.

34:09.687 --> 34:11.155
You take me to the flowers

34:12.221 --> 34:14.455
and you will have a lot more

34:14.489 --> 34:16.721
than a thousand
dollars coming in.

34:16.754 --> 34:20.188
regularly for life.

34:23.720 --> 34:28.222
And maybe even a pet mzungu
if you play your cards right.

34:31.621 --> 34:33.189
And I thought you were here

34:33.222 --> 34:35.554
to help me solve my problems
and not add to them.

34:40.454 --> 34:41.754
If you have the money now

34:42.922 --> 34:45.389
I could take you to
the village tomorrow.

34:45.422 --> 34:46.522
I swear by God.

35:04.921 --> 35:06.189
Little bitch!

35:06.221 --> 35:07.155
What the...

35:17.655 --> 35:20.388
Fuck!

35:36.255 --> 35:37.389
Hail white lion.

35:39.655 --> 35:40.489
Hail.

35:41.654 --> 35:46.223
Respect in the name
of the most high.

35:58.289 --> 36:02.455
Now, tell me about
your unpleasantness.

36:04.355 --> 36:06.821
I was just having a drink
at the bar over there

36:07.822 --> 36:10.889
and then I was robbed by some
idiot whore and her pimp.

36:17.955 --> 36:20.455
Oh, dear, dear,
dear, dear, dear.

36:21.322 --> 36:22.156
How sad.

36:24.321 --> 36:26.188
50 years of independence

36:26.221 --> 36:29.255
our brothers and sisters
are forced to steal

36:29.289 --> 36:31.655
and to prostitute
themselves to survive.

36:33.621 --> 36:34.855
Nobody forced her man.

36:37.787 --> 36:40.454
We are victims in
this mystery Babylon.

36:41.955 --> 36:43.289
This is bullshit.

36:44.954 --> 36:46.788
Just describe the guy to me.

36:48.255 --> 36:50.256
Some junky hooker
called Destiny.

36:54.955 --> 36:57.255
Or maybe you should
try and find her pimp.

36:57.288 --> 36:59.854
Some guy called
Ras B or something.

37:06.720 --> 37:07.621
Interesting.

37:16.254 --> 37:17.288
King lion.

37:21.855 --> 37:22.689
Respect.

37:27.588 --> 37:29.322
That's an interesting
one.

37:29.355 --> 37:30.188
Why do you want to
fight.

37:30.222 --> 37:31.421
Give me my fucking
money.

37:31.454 --> 37:33.687
What fucking money?

37:40.387 --> 37:42.122
Pull that blood clot.

37:58.354 --> 38:01.421
You charge your mouth
like a drunken elephant.

38:01.453 --> 38:04.156
Demanding money and confessions.

38:05.321 --> 38:07.787
Now your life is in his hands.

38:07.820 --> 38:10.388
But he was the one
that was robbed.

38:10.420 --> 38:11.521
Leave him alone.

38:14.755 --> 38:18.288
You, working with
a white belly rat

38:18.321 --> 38:21.188
like all the others who
came to rape Africa.

38:22.121 --> 38:25.322
And you open your legs
for him willingly.

38:26.520 --> 38:27.688
Go back to your village

38:27.720 --> 38:30.122
and ask for forgiveness
from your ancestors.

38:31.388 --> 38:34.422
ancestors.

38:35.955 --> 38:37.388
And I was actually starting

38:37.420 --> 38:39.321
to take all this
stuff seriously.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.188
What are you idiots doing?

38:44.221 --> 38:45.387
Relax old man,

38:46.754 --> 38:48.122
go back to your buto.

38:49.354 --> 38:50.688
I'm going to call the police.

39:01.554 --> 39:03.320
Bumbaclot.

39:11.388 --> 39:14.123
Enjoy the small change brother.

39:49.354 --> 39:52.355
Let's go it's not safe here.

39:52.387 --> 39:53.455
Give me my bag.

39:56.588 --> 40:00.754
I'm not leaving until
I have my money.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.721
Don't make any more
trouble with Ras B

40:05.755 --> 40:06.889
or someone else.

40:06.922 --> 40:08.322
That is bullshit.

40:15.353 --> 40:16.387
Come on.

40:17.420 --> 40:18.787
Come on.

40:18.821 --> 40:20.288
Hugo

40:20.321 --> 40:21.156
Yeah.

40:43.387 --> 40:46.220
- it was you.
- No.

40:46.253 --> 40:47.187
I swear I didn't.

40:47.220 --> 40:49.554
Then what the fuck is this?

40:49.587 --> 40:51.254
God guided me.

40:53.187 --> 40:55.454
I got it back for you
that's all you need to know.

41:17.454 --> 41:18.522
Well then,

41:22.221 --> 41:25.754
God be praised.

41:33.420 --> 41:34.588
Let's go get a drink.

41:35.255 --> 41:37.188
so you can get robbed again?

41:42.353 --> 41:43.287
Come on just

41:45.187 --> 41:46.588
I'm sorry, come on.

41:48.921 --> 41:51.254
Your village must
be really something.

41:51.288 --> 41:54.655
It's called Makaana just
another African shit-hole.

41:56.321 --> 41:58.455
So why do you care
if you get evicted?

41:58.488 --> 42:00.388
It's my father's land

42:00.420 --> 42:03.287
and I'm not giving it
away to some fake priest.

42:04.320 --> 42:07.187
But you don't mind if it's a
white guy coming to save you?

42:07.221 --> 42:08.488
You're joking.

42:08.521 --> 42:10.789
Who just saved you from
the Rastas back there?

43:35.655 --> 43:38.489
There's never a ride
when you need one.

43:39.655 --> 43:40.489
So?

43:43.354 --> 43:45.788
So,

43:45.821 --> 43:48.287
I hope your legs are as
strong as your liver.

43:57.655 --> 44:00.222
Why are you so
interested in Bulu?

44:03.421 --> 44:04.588
Is it worth a lot of money?

44:08.454 --> 44:09.755
It's not really about that.

44:11.253 --> 44:12.654
Bulu is...

44:12.687 --> 44:15.420
It's a spiritual experience

44:15.454 --> 44:17.888
and we mzungu we need that.

44:17.921 --> 44:20.654
Whoa!

44:20.688 --> 44:23.721
We don't really do God
or magic anymore so.

44:25.621 --> 44:29.588
So when you bring
it back to the UK

44:29.621 --> 44:31.689
will you become like a prophet?

44:34.288 --> 44:36.322
Hugo the Messiah.

44:41.421 --> 44:44.320
You have a

44:44.354 --> 44:46.655
a thing for Messiahs, don't you?

44:49.788 --> 44:51.588
whoa shit whoa.

45:07.288 --> 45:09.621
Welcome to Makaana.

45:11.354 --> 45:12.855
This is the real Africa,

45:12.888 --> 45:14.755
the most beautiful
place in the world.

45:14.788 --> 45:17.687
Okay, okay, I've seen
the lion King.

45:17.720 --> 45:20.487
Yeah, you remind me
of the stupid warthog.

45:20.521 --> 45:21.489
Oh, Princess.

45:22.854 --> 45:25.621
The last one to the village
gets eaten by hyenas.

45:27.188 --> 45:29.622
Okay, hakuna matata.

45:35.787 --> 45:36.587
Fuck's sake.

45:46.321 --> 45:48.622
Isn't that the
girl from the bar?

45:48.654 --> 45:51.621
She's my sister, unfortunately.

45:53.821 --> 45:57.622
Well, she'd better
not bring those

45:57.654 --> 45:59.421
Rasta assholes down here.

46:02.187 --> 46:06.287
Angela is perfectly capable
of causing trouble on her own.

46:08.488 --> 46:09.655
Oh, fuck.

46:56.420 --> 46:57.454
Hi, I'm Hugo.

47:17.321 --> 47:19.721
Hi, I'm Isaac.

47:19.755 --> 47:22.255
I hope you'll be happy to stay

47:22.287 --> 47:23.621
in the church quarters?

47:24.887 --> 47:26.489
Yeah, sure.

47:28.453 --> 47:30.187
And welcome back Kisakye.

47:31.153 --> 47:34.487
Don't worry, we won't
be evicting you my dear.

47:34.521 --> 47:36.589
Nope, I'm here to stay.

47:39.688 --> 47:41.888
And we hear that you
came with Angela.

47:41.921 --> 47:45.421
It's nice that the two of
you are together again.

47:45.454 --> 47:47.855
Oh yes, but I don't think
she'll be staying long.

48:02.488 --> 48:05.421
Geez, this is gonna be fun.

48:05.454 --> 48:08.554
The stupid sister of mine
should stay in church.

48:08.587 --> 48:10.554
Maybe that will do her good.

48:19.188 --> 48:20.854
I don't think Aunt Betty
would be very happy

48:20.887 --> 48:22.854
if you and I were
in the same room.

48:24.620 --> 48:25.454
Hugo.

49:35.453 --> 49:36.621
Brethren,

49:36.654 --> 49:39.754
he can even come
into your community

49:39.786 --> 49:41.754
disguised as your friend.

49:41.786 --> 49:46.255
Or even he can come
disguised as a man

49:46.288 --> 49:49.787
so that your daughter
fornicates with the devil.

49:53.453 --> 49:55.454
We shall chase the devil
from our community,

49:55.487 --> 49:58.387
from our society, from
our midst, hallelujah!

49:58.421 --> 49:59.853
Amen.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.654
We must
the devil.

50:06.687 --> 50:08.421
Amen.

50:08.454 --> 50:12.355
Now brethren, you
must stand up and pray!

50:12.387 --> 50:14.220
Stand up and pray.

50:14.254 --> 50:15.687
Pray so hard

50:15.720 --> 50:18.787
because we must chase
the devil from our midst.

50:18.820 --> 50:20.188
Oh, Jesus.

50:21.654 --> 50:22.455
Clap for Jesus.

50:23.619 --> 50:25.753
- Clap for Him.
- Amen.

50:25.786 --> 50:30.787
Clap for Jesus.

50:31.787 --> 50:35.187
Lord Jesus there are those among
us who are tempted with sin

50:35.221 --> 50:38.221
give them the strength
to drive away sin.

50:39.687 --> 50:41.721
Give them strength oh Lord.

50:41.753 --> 50:43.920
Come on to them, they need you.

50:43.954 --> 50:46.255
They wish they could take you.

50:46.287 --> 50:50.254
Lord, drive the devil
from your daughter.

50:51.321 --> 50:53.154
Let him leave this body.

51:41.786 --> 51:43.320
There, there.

51:43.354 --> 51:45.621
You know, Hugo,

51:45.653 --> 51:49.686
you don't have to stay
at that demons house.

51:49.720 --> 51:52.388
You could stay in
the church quarters.

51:52.421 --> 51:54.288
With Isaac.

51:54.321 --> 51:56.888
No, no. He stays far away.

51:56.921 --> 51:58.388
The church quarters
are for people

51:58.420 --> 52:01.220
who don't have friendly
relatives in Makaana.

52:01.254 --> 52:03.322
Like little old you and me.

52:06.253 --> 52:06.888
Yeah.

52:08.220 --> 52:09.221
Interesting.

52:11.687 --> 52:16.155
I wonder what little old Kisakye

52:16.188 --> 52:17.388
would say about that?

52:17.421 --> 52:19.155
Oh, she's used to
sleeping alone.

52:20.420 --> 52:22.454
And it's very cozy
in the quarters.

52:23.519 --> 52:24.354
Yeah.

52:25.453 --> 52:27.221
Yeah, it maybe tempting.

52:38.953 --> 52:42.888
That song, I've heard it before.

52:46.220 --> 52:47.854
And so have I.

52:47.886 --> 52:50.254
A thousand times in
this fucking village.

52:54.187 --> 52:56.254
Something bad is
about to happen.

52:56.288 --> 52:58.222
You worry too much.

53:02.287 --> 53:03.887
Come on.

53:28.719 --> 53:30.221
What the fuck is that?

53:32.954 --> 53:35.388
This wasn't a good
idea, you had better go.

54:09.819 --> 54:10.720
Hey Hugo.

54:40.220 --> 54:40.855
Fire.

54:57.820 --> 54:59.255
You see, you saw.

55:17.452 --> 55:18.287
What...

55:21.620 --> 55:24.787
What happens if someone
dies in one of my visions?

55:24.820 --> 55:25.821
How can I stop that?

55:28.854 --> 55:29.753
Stop.

55:29.786 --> 55:30.620
No.

55:33.187 --> 55:35.587
Only

55:40.920 --> 55:43.787
Stop, stop.

55:53.720 --> 55:57.554
So there is nothing you can do?

56:12.252 --> 56:12.888
Do it.

57:37.287 --> 57:39.386
Where the fuck does
she keep this shit?

58:57.520 --> 58:58.721
Please use the path.

59:31.519 --> 59:32.386
What's wrong?

59:34.186 --> 59:36.420
Took your word like
an idle peasant.

59:38.452 --> 59:40.387
and
gossip with my sister.

59:43.387 --> 59:44.254
Spying on me.

59:48.353 --> 59:50.554
Oh, the drinking
is a problem, huh?

59:50.587 --> 59:52.154
I'll just stick to Bulu then.

59:54.387 --> 59:55.588
Stupid white goat.

1:00:02.553 --> 1:00:03.386
Thanks.

1:00:05.586 --> 1:00:07.220
How many do I need to eat

1:00:07.253 --> 1:00:08.621
to see you next Tuesday?

1:00:16.921 --> 1:00:19.521
If I were you I
wouldn't eat that

1:00:19.554 --> 1:00:21.421
unless you want to
get seriously ill.

1:00:26.353 --> 1:00:28.121
'Cause you gotta
process it first.

1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:33.454
Ain't you gonna show
me how that's done?

1:00:34.452 --> 1:00:36.219
You are not from my clan.

1:00:36.253 --> 1:00:37.887
You are not even
from my country.

1:00:38.921 --> 1:00:40.254
Why would I do that?

1:00:45.586 --> 1:00:47.454
It still will get me
high though, right?

1:02:22.819 --> 1:02:25.620
Chew white goat, chew.

1:02:25.653 --> 1:02:28.153
You didn't let him take
all that stuff, did you?

1:02:53.953 --> 1:02:56.521
Who are you to
tell me what to do?

1:02:58.719 --> 1:03:01.586
Kitonsa who's land
you propose to steal.

1:03:06.586 --> 1:03:08.686
He did not know
what was happening.

1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:10.754
You forced him to sign
while he was dying.

1:03:11.753 --> 1:03:12.687
Hypocrites.

1:04:48.452 --> 1:04:49.286
Angela.

1:05:08.719 --> 1:05:09.554
A boy.

1:05:23.952 --> 1:05:25.253
There, there.

1:05:45.685 --> 1:05:47.121
There, there!

1:06:23.219 --> 1:06:27.586
Let's go huh? Come on,
let's get out of here.

1:06:44.652 --> 1:06:47.353
Come on, I am not
drinking alone.

1:06:53.619 --> 1:06:54.753
The big tarantula.

1:06:56.752 --> 1:06:57.587
Mzungu.

1:07:00.352 --> 1:07:02.421
Hey, you're learning huh?

1:07:03.819 --> 1:07:05.454
President Hugo.

1:07:07.853 --> 1:07:12.287
Hugo, you have done
something wonderful.

1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:13.887
Thank you very much.

1:07:13.920 --> 1:07:16.320
Ah, it's a miracle.

1:07:17.852 --> 1:07:19.753
It's a miracle, thank you.

1:07:19.785 --> 1:07:20.585
A miracle.

1:07:20.619 --> 1:07:21.886
Oh yes. Oh yes.

1:07:21.919 --> 1:07:23.420
Thank you very much.

1:07:24.553 --> 1:07:25.652
What miracle?

1:07:25.685 --> 1:07:26.520
Hugo.

1:07:27.953 --> 1:07:31.320
Let me tell you something
messenger of God.

1:07:31.352 --> 1:07:33.786
It was I who saved
Irumba just now.

1:07:33.818 --> 1:07:37.753
Not you nor your
bullshit Holy ghost.

1:07:37.785 --> 1:07:40.819
I did it, me.

1:07:40.853 --> 1:07:44.121
Blasphemy, God forgive you.

1:07:45.786 --> 1:07:48.387
I used the power of an
ancient African substance

1:07:48.420 --> 1:07:49.753
to save that little boy's life

1:07:49.786 --> 1:07:52.387
not some Christian mambo jambo.

1:07:52.420 --> 1:07:54.488
Now that is a fucking miracle.

1:07:55.488 --> 1:07:57.586
And it has sweet nothing
to do with Jesus Christ

1:07:57.619 --> 1:07:59.186
or this pompous prick here.

1:08:01.919 --> 1:08:04.287
People you all just stand here

1:08:04.319 --> 1:08:07.286
as this man insults our God?

1:08:07.320 --> 1:08:09.153
He fornicates with
our daughters.

1:08:09.187 --> 1:08:11.620
He corrupts
everybody, Oh my God.

1:08:12.785 --> 1:08:15.187
He wouldn't be the first
pervert in Makaana.

1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:16.454
Would he pastor?

1:08:26.785 --> 1:08:30.520
See, see how he's dividing us.

1:08:30.552 --> 1:08:33.353
Have you all been
blinded by his trickery?

1:08:35.186 --> 1:08:37.420
I think they see things
a lot more clearly now.

1:08:38.585 --> 1:08:42.619
This is no place for you devil.

1:08:42.652 --> 1:08:43.487
Be gone.

1:08:46.952 --> 1:08:47.786
Hugo.

1:08:52.919 --> 1:08:54.153
Hugo.

1:08:55.420 --> 1:08:57.221
Why waste good booze, huh?

1:09:00.420 --> 1:09:03.254
Say goodbye to
the bad man folks.

1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:20.920
What can you see now?

1:09:24.886 --> 1:09:26.520
I see

1:09:27.386 --> 1:09:32.387
a long, lazy, afternoon,

1:09:35.752 --> 1:09:37.785
a beautiful, wicked, girl,

1:09:39.885 --> 1:09:43.186
maybe a couple of beers.

1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:44.787
The prophet has spoken.

1:09:46.286 --> 1:09:48.153
You'll need someone in Makaana.

1:09:48.186 --> 1:09:50.353
She doesn't understand business.

1:09:50.387 --> 1:09:52.653
She thinks Bulu is satanic.

1:09:52.685 --> 1:09:54.619
Why should I trust you?

1:09:54.652 --> 1:09:57.354
Why don't I just work with
someone else from the village?

1:09:57.386 --> 1:10:00.419
Better the devil you know.

1:10:00.452 --> 1:10:03.387
And our other
unfinished business.

1:10:03.419 --> 1:10:06.354
Do you think she'd
mind if we borrowed her bed?

1:10:10.486 --> 1:10:11.853
- Oh, you're making food.
- Hi.

1:10:11.885 --> 1:10:13.520
- Oh, God I'm so hungry.
- No.

1:10:13.552 --> 1:10:14.452
I'm just...

1:10:14.485 --> 1:10:16.452
Ah, me too whatcha cooking?

1:10:16.486 --> 1:10:20.220
Come on, please, I don't
need drunkards in my house.

1:10:36.220 --> 1:10:38.187
It's amazing how
stupid you can be.

1:10:38.220 --> 1:10:39.887
Do you not see her game?

1:10:39.919 --> 1:10:41.719
Kisakye.

1:10:41.752 --> 1:10:43.286
Come on, fuck's sake.

1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:44.120
Hugo.

1:10:45.287 --> 1:10:46.786
Do you know who took
your money in Hollywood?

1:10:49.886 --> 1:10:51.720
She stole your money

1:10:51.753 --> 1:10:55.287
and then watched you nearly get
killed by those Rasta thugs.

1:10:58.718 --> 1:11:00.187
Ever since you got here,

1:11:00.220 --> 1:11:01.553
she's been trying
to steal from you.

1:11:02.785 --> 1:11:03.653
Can't you see?

1:11:05.518 --> 1:11:06.752
She's a witch.

1:11:08.752 --> 1:11:10.386
and they called my father one.

1:11:11.418 --> 1:11:13.819
You are wicked, evil.

1:11:18.451 --> 1:11:20.319
Angela, just get out.

1:11:20.351 --> 1:11:21.552
Get the fuck out.

1:11:22.518 --> 1:11:25.452
Fuck you, impotent junkie.

1:11:34.186 --> 1:11:35.886
I think you better go too.

1:12:17.785 --> 1:12:19.253
Dada!

1:12:19.286 --> 1:12:21.719
Bobby come here.

1:12:21.753 --> 1:12:23.286
I'm filming this.

1:12:24.252 --> 1:12:25.753
I told the police.

1:12:30.818 --> 1:12:34.486
You tell Hugo I want my money.

1:12:57.319 --> 1:12:58.486
Is everything okay?

1:13:13.752 --> 1:13:14.620
It's my son.

1:13:21.220 --> 1:13:22.819
My family has been attacked.

1:13:29.552 --> 1:13:31.452
I need to get home.

1:13:35.286 --> 1:13:36.687
I'm so sorry Hugo.

1:13:39.653 --> 1:13:42.153
You need to get
back to your family.

1:13:45.419 --> 1:13:47.352
You can't stay here anymore.

1:13:58.318 --> 1:14:00.185
Please go away, go.

1:14:06.485 --> 1:14:09.319
Why won't you give
it to me now, huh?

1:14:09.351 --> 1:14:10.586
We had a fucking deal.

1:14:14.785 --> 1:14:16.585
I don't understand.

1:14:16.618 --> 1:14:18.120
You said you were gonna...

1:14:21.419 --> 1:14:22.186
what the fuck.

1:14:22.218 --> 1:14:23.252
I fucking need it.

1:14:23.285 --> 1:14:25.487
I need to see what's gonna
fucking happen to me.

1:14:35.218 --> 1:14:36.285
Do you have no more?

1:14:36.319 --> 1:14:37.286
Hugo you're hurting me.

1:14:37.319 --> 1:14:39.286
Yeah, but you're gonna
give me what you have.

1:14:39.318 --> 1:14:40.320
Do you understand?

1:14:42.418 --> 1:14:43.652
What's wrong?

1:14:43.685 --> 1:14:45.520
You're gonna give
me what you have.

1:14:48.518 --> 1:14:50.619
What is wrong with you.

1:14:54.886 --> 1:14:56.419
- Where is it?
- Let go off me.

1:14:56.452 --> 1:14:57.720
Where is it?

1:14:57.753 --> 1:14:59.285
- Let go my hand is hurting.
- Where is it!

1:14:59.319 --> 1:15:01.153
Where is it?

1:15:07.252 --> 1:15:08.151
Huh?

1:15:08.185 --> 1:15:10.853
I'll let go once you
tell me where it is.

1:15:53.719 --> 1:15:54.553
That's it.

1:16:40.251 --> 1:16:40.887
Hugo!

1:16:45.619 --> 1:16:48.685
Hugo, you are alive?

1:16:58.186 --> 1:17:00.920
I'm going to fucking kill him.

1:17:00.953 --> 1:17:02.620
Who? Who you kill?

1:17:18.586 --> 1:17:23.487
Kisakye, I knew you would come.

1:17:27.452 --> 1:17:28.553
He told me.

1:17:28.585 --> 1:17:30.352
The American has left.

1:17:30.386 --> 1:17:32.553
He is never coming back.

1:17:33.853 --> 1:17:35.153
That is very good.

1:17:36.586 --> 1:17:38.153
He had started to corrupt you.

1:17:42.719 --> 1:17:44.820
Please,

1:17:49.786 --> 1:17:50.620
Yes, but

1:17:52.285 --> 1:17:54.552
he was here for a good
reason to help me.

1:17:56.585 --> 1:18:00.486
Kisakye, if the devil
offered you his hand

1:18:00.518 --> 1:18:02.819
over a raging river
would you take it?

1:18:05.619 --> 1:18:08.553
If I was drowning, maybe.

1:18:10.785 --> 1:18:13.820
No, that would be wrong.

1:18:13.853 --> 1:18:15.520
It would be better

1:18:15.552 --> 1:18:18.519
to swim against the current
or to perish in the water.

1:18:22.652 --> 1:18:24.752
Enough with your parables Isaac.

1:18:27.518 --> 1:18:28.619
That land is mine

1:18:30.352 --> 1:18:31.652
and as God is our witness,

1:18:31.686 --> 1:18:33.586
you know you're stealing it.

1:18:33.619 --> 1:18:38.620
Kisakye, did you come here

1:18:39.352 --> 1:18:39.786
to provoke me, huh?

1:18:39.818 --> 1:18:40.652
No.

1:18:42.519 --> 1:18:44.452
I came here to tell
you to give up now

1:18:45.652 --> 1:18:47.385
or I'll take you to court

1:18:47.418 --> 1:18:50.520
and the whole village will
know how you cheated my family.

1:18:51.485 --> 1:18:52.487
It is too late Kisakye

1:18:53.885 --> 1:18:56.353
the land belongs to God now.

1:18:57.318 --> 1:18:58.419
On your head be it.

1:18:59.585 --> 1:19:00.685
Your father never
disciplined you.

1:19:02.185 --> 1:19:04.586
My father taught me
with love not fear.

1:19:04.619 --> 1:19:05.919
He was a witch.

1:19:07.553 --> 1:19:09.586
You, you have the witches blood.

1:19:09.618 --> 1:19:12.552
His voice, his stench.

1:19:14.351 --> 1:19:17.520
You gave yourself
to the American.

1:19:17.552 --> 1:19:18.519
The devil.

1:19:18.552 --> 1:19:20.486
Get off me.

1:19:20.518 --> 1:19:22.519
You gave off yourself to him.

1:19:36.819 --> 1:19:41.820
Get the fuck off her.

1:19:43.518 --> 1:19:45.685
Let me fucking go.

1:19:45.719 --> 1:19:46.553
Let me go.

1:20:59.817 --> 1:21:00.587
Kisakye,

1:21:05.185 --> 1:21:05.818
I'm sorry.

1:21:11.719 --> 1:21:12.752
I need the Bulu.

1:21:16.852 --> 1:21:18.419
My family.

1:21:18.452 --> 1:21:19.353
You can take it.

1:21:28.418 --> 1:21:30.785
I don't want to see
that stuff ever again.

1:21:50.286 --> 1:21:50.853
Hugo.

1:21:52.518 --> 1:21:53.319
What?

1:21:54.717 --> 1:21:55.719
Where's the Bulu?

1:22:00.519 --> 1:22:01.786
Angela, fuck it.

1:22:03.653 --> 1:22:06.286
You do not follow me, okay?

1:22:06.319 --> 1:22:07.752
I will kill you, I've seen it.

1:22:32.652 --> 1:22:33.751
Don't follow me.

1:23:43.751 --> 1:23:45.285
Give me the bag.

1:24:07.885 --> 1:24:08.719
Hugo.

1:24:10.553 --> 1:24:14.486
Hugo! Please.

1:24:14.519 --> 1:24:16.553
Hugo don't leave her like this.

1:24:16.584 --> 1:24:20.586
Angela, shh, shh, shh.

1:24:31.818 --> 1:24:32.752
Fuck!

1:25:03.486 --> 1:25:04.785
Angela.

1:25:04.817 --> 1:25:07.353
Kisakye. Angela.
