14:18.525 --> 14:20.151
[girl] Dad.

14:28.827 --> 14:34.040
[phone rings]

14:35.542 --> 14:36.376
Hello?

14:36.459 --> 14:37.502
Harry?

14:37.586 --> 14:39.254
[Bosch] Speaking.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.256
Ernie Munger from the coroner's office.

14:41.339 --> 14:44.217
Oh. Hey, Ernie.
What's going on?

14:45.927 --> 14:48.763
Look, I heard what happened in Hollywood.

14:49.973 --> 14:50.807
I'm a father.

14:51.766 --> 14:54.769
I thought I'd call you first
before notifying RHD.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.193
You still there?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.531
Yeah.

15:06.615 --> 15:07.907
Go ahead.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.660
A Jane Doe just landed.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.746
Blunt force trauma.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.832
White female, 20, 25 years old.

15:16.958 --> 15:21.588
I'm praying it's not her,
but she fits the description.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.423
Where was she?

15:24.299 --> 15:25.300
Sheriff's body dump.

15:25.383 --> 15:29.220
They found her on an exit ramp
on the 5 in East LA.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.766
I'm coming down.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.018
I want eyes on her before anyone.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.438
I'll get you in.

15:38.521 --> 15:39.773
Thanks.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.946
[phone ringing]

15:47.030 --> 15:49.032
[indistinct chatter]

15:54.162 --> 15:55.163
Progress?

15:55.246 --> 15:58.124
Not much from her apartment complex.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.626
Some Ring cameras in that neighborhood--

15:59.709 --> 16:00.919
[Jerry]
Won't pick up anything in the street.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.212
[Conniff]
If they were even turned on.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.755
We're still canvassing.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.256
-What's the radius?
-One block.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.174
Make it three.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.843
We don't have a suspect description,
nothing on the vehicle.

16:08.927 --> 16:09.761
What are we looking for here, Edgar?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.680
Anything that looks and feels suspicious.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.306
Well, that narrows it down.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.475
-We'll keep at it.
-I'm around.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.435
All right.

16:17.519 --> 16:18.728
[engine turns off]

17:15.492 --> 17:17.078
Thanks.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.218
[somber music playing]

18:39.577 --> 18:42.580

19:16.865 --> 19:17.866

[sighs]

19:43.016 --> 19:44.934
[phone rings]

19:46.853 --> 19:48.646
Still matching numbers and names.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.732
[Bosch]
Any unusual calls?

19:50.815 --> 19:53.860
One incoming unidentified,
provided by Boost Mobile.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.445
Burner.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.113
Bet the son of a bitch called her.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.366
I'll try and track down the user,
but I can't promise anything.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.534
What about known contacts?

20:01.618 --> 20:03.161
Chandler tried a few times this week.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.996
Keep digging.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.459
[sighs]

20:22.931 --> 20:24.557
[engine starts]

20:27.560 --> 20:29.771
[banging on door]

20:30.605 --> 20:31.439
Harry?

20:31.522 --> 20:33.066
Maddie's been taken.
I need your help.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.442
Well, come in, come in.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.361
What do you mean
she's been taken?

20:36.444 --> 20:38.404
Case she was involved with,
a serial rapist.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.990
Cops are calling him the Screen Cutter.
I think he has her.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.450
Oh, God. When?

20:42.533 --> 20:44.452
Last night. When's the last time
you spoke with her?

20:44.535 --> 20:46.829
Well, not-- not last night.
The night before.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.790
-On the phone?
-Her place. I went to see her.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.586
He had to be watching her,
casing her place,

20:53.670 --> 20:55.046
getting her routine down.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.841
Did you see anything when you went there?
Anything at all?

21:01.135 --> 21:01.970
Uh...

21:02.929 --> 21:07.141
T-There was someone in the courtyard
when I went in.

21:07.225 --> 21:10.687
A man.
I-I saw him when I was at her front door.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.815
I... I mean,
I just assumed it was another tenant,

21:13.898 --> 21:15.191
a neighbor out for a smoke.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.985
I didn't really pay any attention to him.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.444
-He was smoking?
-Yes.

21:18.528 --> 21:21.489
Do you think you could identify him
if you saw him again?

21:21.572 --> 21:22.657
Maybe.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.618
Is this what happened in the other cases?
Did he abduct his victims?

21:25.702 --> 21:27.870
-[line out rings]
-No. We don't know why he took Maddie.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.372
But there's a reason he broke his MO.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.540
[phone rings]

21:32.792 --> 21:33.626
Harry.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.211
[Bosch] Jerry, I have a witness
who saw a guy

21:35.294 --> 21:37.463
outside Maddie's apartment building
the night before.

21:37.547 --> 21:38.423
He was fucking skiing her place.

21:38.506 --> 21:42.260
We did a canvass of the whole complex.
Nobody saw anything.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.761
It's Honey Chandler.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.888
She was visiting Maddie,
saw the guy.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.932
You need to set her up with
a composite artist as soon as possible.

21:48.016 --> 21:51.185
Wait a minute. Wait, Harry.
How does she know it was the guy?

21:51.269 --> 21:52.353
She doesn't, but I do.

21:53.771 --> 21:54.605
I'll set it up.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.775
[dramatic music playing]

22:35.980 --> 22:37.815
[engine turns off]

23:15.353 --> 23:19.232
-[grunting]
-Oh, shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay.

23:20.274 --> 23:21.984
[grunts]

23:22.068 --> 23:25.446
[exhales deeply]

23:25.530 --> 23:27.198
Okay.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.534
Oh, you're a plucky little bitch.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.080
[panting]

23:44.006 --> 23:46.926
Someone saw him running down this alley
after the attempted rape,

23:47.009 --> 23:49.262
looking for a car to steal.

23:49.345 --> 23:52.265
They see what direction he ran in
after he tossed the mask?

23:52.348 --> 23:54.976
Nope. Here's where she found it.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.898
These cameras work?

24:00.982 --> 24:03.109
Just for monitoring, not recording.

24:04.569 --> 24:05.570
Tenants see anything?

24:05.653 --> 24:06.863
Broad daylight.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.156
Nothing.

24:10.241 --> 24:13.327
I told her, let the detectives handle it.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.665
She couldn't let it go.

24:18.958 --> 24:19.959
Wouldn't you have done the same?

24:22.837 --> 24:23.838
Probably.

24:29.010 --> 24:30.094
Something on your mind?

24:33.472 --> 24:34.473
I don't know.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.227
I just didn't get through to her.

24:38.311 --> 24:39.145
This isn't on you.

24:45.902 --> 24:49.197
Maddie spotted that, too.
Even followed up with the city inspector.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.408
Told him to keep his eyes and ears open.

24:58.372 --> 24:59.749
I have a bad feeling about this.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.792
Is he holding it together?

25:01.876 --> 25:03.586
Goin' full tilt until he finds her.

25:03.669 --> 25:04.670
[computer mouse clicks]

25:04.754 --> 25:07.882
As my grandma used to sing,
keep on the sunny side.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.967
You hear from Harry,
I'm your first call.

25:10.051 --> 25:11.510
You know it.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.518
[sighs]

25:19.602 --> 25:21.604
[typing]

25:33.532 --> 25:35.493
Afternoon, sir.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.411
Can I have your driver's license,
registration, please?

25:37.495 --> 25:38.746
[driver]
What did I do?

25:38.829 --> 25:40.915
[Maddie] I'll explain after
you give me your driver's license.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.918
[Chandler sighs]
So many choices.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.503
[composite artist]
Take your time.

25:50.091 --> 25:51.717
I hope that thing has an eraser.

25:51.801 --> 25:55.304
Why don't you try
visualizing the moment again?

25:59.433 --> 26:00.518
[exhales deeply]

26:00.601 --> 26:01.519
Pete.

26:01.602 --> 26:02.478
Hey. Kurt.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.355
Catch you at a bad time?

26:04.438 --> 26:06.607
About to head a new meeting, actually.
What's up?

26:06.691 --> 26:10.569
Oh, I was just wondering
if there are any updates on Thai Town.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.905
As far as I know, same as I told you.
They're still working that partial.

26:12.989 --> 26:15.116
Yeah, the fingerprint off the mask.

26:15.199 --> 26:18.953
No matches yet.
You see anything on your route?

26:19.036 --> 26:22.665
A copper called me,
saw one of my notices,

26:22.748 --> 26:24.375
wanted me to keep my eyes open.

26:24.458 --> 26:28.671
I just didn't know if I should be looking
for anything in particular, you know?

26:28.754 --> 26:30.673
All they know is the guy
was wearing a luchador mask.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.508
So no witnesses, huh?

26:32.591 --> 26:33.426
Not yet.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.427
Look, I gotta run.

26:34.510 --> 26:38.180
All right, well, if I see anything
or I hear anything, I will let you know.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.140
Yeah, you do that.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.392
[Dockweiler] And you'll, uh,
you'll keep me posted, right?

26:41.475 --> 26:42.727
I'll try.

26:42.810 --> 26:43.978
[Dockweiler]
Okay, pal. Thanks.

26:44.061 --> 26:44.895
Yep.

26:59.201 --> 27:02.204
[car wash starts]

27:16.761 --> 27:18.888
[Espinosa] In the last week,
three vehicles of interest.

27:18.971 --> 27:22.683
They either parked in that area
and a male was seen crossing the street,

27:22.767 --> 27:25.728
or repeat visitors
who stopped and came back.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.980
You track down the registered owners?

27:28.064 --> 27:31.108
[Conniff] Two were residents, the third
was a visitor, so we excluded him.

27:31.192 --> 27:33.319
This city vehicle popped up a few times.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.279
Passed through
about the same time every day.

27:35.363 --> 27:36.906
The shop number
will give you the department.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.866
Can't make it out.
I tried. It's too blurry.

27:38.949 --> 27:41.494
A lot of residential construction
in that area.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.329
Probably his jurisdiction.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.039
Ah, speaking of city inspectors,

27:45.122 --> 27:47.500
I've gotta check the box
on Maddie's canvassing.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.834
Stay on that video.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.836
Anything that looks
and feels suspicious?

27:50.920 --> 27:52.838
That's the spirit.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.469
You sure this his day off?

27:58.552 --> 27:59.887
That's what his supervisor said.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.056
I don't see a city vehicle.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.350
-It's not a take-home.
-Oh.

28:06.227 --> 28:09.522
What other areas
does he cover besides Thai Town?

28:09.605 --> 28:12.900
Los Feliz, Silver Lake.

28:12.983 --> 28:17.071
But no one ever asked him about squatters
or problem locations in that neighborhood.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.609
The fuck you doing?

28:55.693 --> 28:59.280
Victims all smelled cigarette smoke
on their attacker.

28:59.363 --> 29:03.742
Well, that's a leap. You gonna go around
the city collecting cigarette butts?

29:03.826 --> 29:05.411
If I have to.

29:10.875 --> 29:14.420
[suspenseful music playing]

29:57.046 --> 30:00.049
[soft music playing]

30:58.357 --> 30:59.358
[chuckles]

31:07.533 --> 31:08.534
[sighs]

31:52.536 --> 31:53.912
Hot off the press.

31:56.081 --> 31:59.543
And no matter how much time they take,
their eyes and nose never look right.

31:59.627 --> 32:01.211
She did say it was dark.

32:03.339 --> 32:04.632
Let me ask you something.

32:08.344 --> 32:10.304
[typing]

32:18.604 --> 32:20.564
Mr. Dockweiler?

32:20.648 --> 32:22.441
-[Dockweiler] Yeah?
-[Maddie] You have a sec?

32:22.524 --> 32:23.817
Sure.

32:23.901 --> 32:25.110
Watch his place.

32:26.195 --> 32:28.322
Thought that might be you.
I'm Officer Bosch.

32:28.405 --> 32:31.075
We spoke over the phone
about the Thai Town sexual assaults.

32:31.158 --> 32:32.910
Right, yeah. How's that going?

32:32.993 --> 32:34.495
We're still looking.

32:34.578 --> 32:37.414
[typing]

32:43.545 --> 32:44.380
What do you think?

32:46.548 --> 32:47.675
[Chandler]
That's the guy.

32:47.758 --> 32:48.967
Are you sure?

32:50.010 --> 32:53.639
Yeah, it's him. That's the man
I saw outside Maddie's apartment.

32:53.722 --> 32:54.556
Who is he?

32:54.640 --> 32:56.266
[Bennett]
His name's Kurt Dockweiler.

32:56.350 --> 32:57.351
He's a city inspector.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.645
He picked his victims
from the neighborhoods he worked in.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.314
That's why he wore the mask.
They would have recognized him.

33:02.398 --> 33:05.025
We can get a search warrant
for his house with this, Jerry.

33:05.109 --> 33:05.943
-Jerry.
-Hmm?

33:06.026 --> 33:07.653
-Need a word.
-Sure.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.241
Give me the address.
I'm not waiting for a fuckin' warrant.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.702
Harry, we have to do this the right way.
Otherwise, he could walk.

33:14.785 --> 33:15.911
You have to. I don't.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.621
If she's there,
I don't have a minute to waste.

33:17.705 --> 33:18.831
We'll have a warrant in an hour.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.457
That's all I need.
Where's he live?

33:21.792 --> 33:23.544
Jesus Christ, Jerry. It's Maddie.

33:25.838 --> 33:26.797
He lives in the Valley.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.007
Then I'm headed to the Valley.
Send me the pin.

33:29.091 --> 33:30.676
Look, don't be in there
when the troops land.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.177
Send me the address.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.112
[beeps]

34:34.656 --> 34:35.657
[door unlocks]

34:35.741 --> 34:38.744
[suspenseful music playing]

34:45.250 --> 34:46.543
Maddie!

34:46.627 --> 34:47.628
Maddie, are you here?

35:05.646 --> 35:06.855
Maddie?

35:06.939 --> 35:08.565
Maddie, can you hear me?

35:35.759 --> 35:37.052
[clattering]

35:37.135 --> 35:37.970
Maddie?

35:39.721 --> 35:40.931
Maddie, are you here?

35:41.014 --> 35:44.393
[suspenseful music playing]

35:46.812 --> 35:49.815
[clothes dryer running]

35:59.783 --> 36:02.202
[suspenseful music playing]

37:30.040 --> 37:31.375
Can I help you?

37:35.212 --> 37:36.713
I believe you can.

37:37.923 --> 37:38.924
[chuckles]

38:11.331 --> 38:12.332
[phone vibrates]

38:25.929 --> 38:28.015
[sirens wailing]

38:32.561 --> 38:35.564
[phone rings]

38:35.647 --> 38:37.524
Hey, Jerry. I'm out.

38:37.607 --> 38:39.693
There's enough for Bennett
to collect clean with the search warrant.

38:39.776 --> 38:42.863
Harry. You're not gonna believe this.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.823
Dockweiler just turned himself in.

38:44.906 --> 38:45.991
Where?

38:46.074 --> 38:47.659
[Jerry]
Hollywood Station.

38:47.743 --> 38:48.994
He say anything about Maddie?

38:49.077 --> 38:50.162
[Jerry]
About to find out.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.414
I'm on my way.
Don't let that fucker out of your sight.

38:52.497 --> 38:53.623
[engine starts]

38:56.001 --> 38:58.336
-[Mank] What do you think?
-[Jerry] I think he's good for it.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.964
Hey, could be just another lunatic.

39:01.048 --> 39:02.966
Well, there is that possibility.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.386
I think he's good for it, too.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.313
Mr. Dockweiler.

39:16.396 --> 39:18.732
Detective Jerry Edgar.

39:18.815 --> 39:19.941
You were at my house.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.151
I left you a card.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.319
Is that why you're here?

39:22.402 --> 39:24.946
Well, I know the police
have been looking for me.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.406
[Jerry]
Do you know why?

39:28.075 --> 39:29.618
[Dockweiler]
The missing officer.

39:29.701 --> 39:30.786
[Jerry]
Do you know where she is?

39:31.620 --> 39:32.454
I do.

39:32.537 --> 39:33.371
Where?

39:34.581 --> 39:36.416
Well, I'm not gonna tell you that.

39:37.501 --> 39:39.211
Not until you give me what I want.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.879
And what's that?

39:40.962 --> 39:44.216
Well, you'll have to go through my lawyer.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.717
He's on his way.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.344
But why do you need a lawyer?

39:48.678 --> 39:51.223
We can talk right here, you and me.

39:52.516 --> 39:54.810
Cops are allowed to lie.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.229
The Supreme Court said so.

39:57.312 --> 39:58.730
You know what I think?

40:00.023 --> 40:01.191
I think you're the liar.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.194
You don't know where Madeline Bosch is.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.363
You came in here
spinning some bullshit

40:06.446 --> 40:09.074
because you know we have you
on the Thai Town rapes.

40:18.667 --> 40:21.711
We found your print on that mask,
DNA all over it.

40:29.719 --> 40:32.514
We know you stalked the victims
from your job as an inspector.

40:34.599 --> 40:38.520
If you wanna arrest me for the rapes,
arrest me.

40:40.147 --> 40:41.857
But you won't find her.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.358
Is she alive?

40:44.276 --> 40:45.360
For now.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.820
What does that mean?

40:48.780 --> 40:54.452
It means I'm not gonna say another word
until I speak with my attorney.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.838
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Harry, what the fuck are you doing here?

41:04.921 --> 41:06.214
That motherfucker
knows where my daughter is.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.049
We don't even know if he's the guy.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.217
It's him.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.553
-Let RHD sweat him out.
-Fuck this.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.638
-Harry.
-Don't fuck with me, Mank.

41:13.722 --> 41:15.807
You shouldn't be here!
You know it! I know it!

41:15.891 --> 41:18.018
Go home, Harry!

41:20.395 --> 41:21.229
What'd he say?

41:22.355 --> 41:23.356
He claims he knows where she is.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.150
-Where?
-He lawyered up and stopped talking.

41:26.276 --> 41:27.819
Jesus. Tell me she's still alive.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.821
All he said was...

41:29.905 --> 41:31.114
for now.

41:31.198 --> 41:34.201
[dramatic music playing]

41:44.544 --> 41:47.923
[ragged breathing]

41:55.764 --> 41:56.765
[sighs]

41:59.559 --> 42:01.061
[grunts]

42:02.145 --> 42:03.939
[sighs]

42:16.243 --> 42:17.244
Hello?

42:19.079 --> 42:19.913
[banging]

42:19.996 --> 42:20.830
Hello?

42:24.000 --> 42:25.543
Can anybody hear me?

42:25.627 --> 42:27.629
[whimpering]

42:29.714 --> 42:30.799
[banging]

42:31.967 --> 42:32.842
Hello?

42:34.594 --> 42:36.429
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

42:36.513 --> 42:37.514
[sighs]

42:39.724 --> 42:40.976
Hello?

42:41.935 --> 42:44.562
Help! [whimpers]

42:44.646 --> 42:47.232
Help! I'm in here!
Can anyone hear me?!

42:47.315 --> 42:50.318
[whimpering]

42:52.070 --> 42:53.863
Help!

42:53.947 --> 42:57.033
Help! I'm in here! Help!

42:58.326 --> 43:01.121
Help! Help!

43:01.204 --> 43:06.459
Help! Help! Help!

43:06.543 --> 43:12.090
Can anybody hear me?!
Help! Help!

43:12.173 --> 43:13.717
Help me!

43:13.800 --> 43:16.803
[dramatic music playing]

43:30.608 --> 43:32.402
[Bosch]
Next time on Bosch: Legacy.

43:32.485 --> 43:34.696
She could be anywhere
in a 300-mile radius.

43:34.779 --> 43:36.489
You know what an hourglass is?

43:36.573 --> 43:41.286
You turn 'em over, and the sand
slowly trickles down to the bottom half.

43:41.369 --> 43:44.205
Please, anyone! Help!

43:44.289 --> 43:45.623
Time is running out.

43:45.707 --> 43:47.208
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

43:47.292 --> 43:49.085
You tell me.
What the fuck am I supposed to do?!

43:49.169 --> 43:50.795
Where the hell did this video come from?

43:50.879 --> 43:52.589
Dockweiler must have released it.

43:52.672 --> 43:53.757
She turned over.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.091
[Mo]
Looks like she's crying.

43:56.343 --> 43:57.802
I owe you.

43:57.886 --> 43:59.346
Hey, I'm going with you.

43:59.429 --> 44:01.431
