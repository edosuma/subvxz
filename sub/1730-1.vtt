<i>Half human, half god.</i>

01:19.813 --> 01:24.785
<i>But Zeus' queen, Hera, saw this
bastard child as an insult,</i>

<i>a living reminder of her
husband's infidelity.</i>

01:28.456 --> 01:33.461
<i>Alcmene named the boy Hercules,
which means "glory of Hera,"</i>

01:33.561 --> 01:37.265

Macedonia has been good to us.

Yet, as I was about to explain
before I was so rudely interrupted,

04:30.071 --> 04:34.842
the Nemean Lion was strong, too.
Yet, he still destroyed it.

04:34.942 --> 04:39.678
And not with a sword or
a spear or arrows. No!

04:42.783 --> 04:45.751
I did it with my bare hands!

04:48.422 --> 04:50.389
Or so they say.

There's 40 of us. One of you.

The king of this land has offered
me gold to dispose of you.

Twenty pirates at two

Not a bad night.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.712
You see how the pirates ran?
My story softened their resolve.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.015
Their resolve must be broken, Iolaus.

07:28.115 --> 07:31.919
When you spread the legend of
Hercules, make it bigger, scarier.

07:32.019 --> 07:35.289
The more they believe Hercules
is truly the son of Zeus,

07:35.389 --> 07:37.658
the less likely they are to fight.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.758
Oh!

Ah!

08:29.243 --> 08:30.611
That's a pretty sight.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.046
One more payday, Autolycus,
that's all we need.

08:33.145 --> 08:36.250
Then we get to live like
the kings we've served.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.251
Or live simply.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.989
You still dreaming
of barbarian lands?

08:43.089 --> 08:45.759
Beyond the Aegean.
At the shores of the Black Sea.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.563
That is where I will live out the
rest of my days in solitude.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.882
- Boring, if you ask me.
- Maybe so, Autolycus.

08:52.982 --> 08:57.537
But I'll never find peace unless
I move as far away as possible.

08:58.139 --> 09:02.543
What of Tydeus? Without you to temper
his rage, I fear what he may become.

09:02.643 --> 09:07.615
Tydeus will go with me. Civilization
has become too civilized for us.

- Are you his servant?
- I'm his nephew.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.338
- Are you, really?
- I tell of Hercules' Twelve Labors,

09:31.438 --> 09:34.141
like the Nemean Lion,
the Apples of the Hesperides,

09:34.241 --> 09:38.478
the Belt of Hippolyta with its buxom
naked Amazons and exciting bondage.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.015
- I immortalize him...
- He talks, while the rest of us fight.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.119
It is a wonder you share the
same blood as Hercules.

- My words are for him, not you.

10:13.414 --> 10:16.515
Atalanta, it's all right.

10:22.289 --> 10:26.594
- You certainly are a hard man to find.
- Maybe I don't want anyone to find me.

I'm not just anyone. My name is
Ergenia, daughter to Lord Cotys.

10:31.731 --> 10:35.333
Your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir.

10:36.470 --> 10:41.575
My father is most unfortunate.
He battles a warlord, Rhesus.

10:41.675 --> 10:45.629
Our land is torn by civil war. Every day,
villages are destroyed, crops ruined,

10:45.729 --> 10:49.115
- innocents slaughtered.
- We all have problems.

10:49.716 --> 10:55.287
Well, perhaps I can convince you
to make our problems your own.

10:55.789 --> 10:59.927
Unfortunately, My Lady, Hercules is fully
committed till the Feast of Dionysus.

11:00.027 --> 11:04.632
We could, however, advance you to
the front of the line, for the right price.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.401
Hmm. I thought heroes
fight for glory.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.570
But mercenaries fight for gold.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.506
- Lord Cotys is a rich man.
- I like him already.

11:12.606 --> 11:17.208
If you agree to aid him,
he will pay your weight in gold.

Though not quite as big
an honor as I expected.

General, go tell my
father Hercules is here.

13:10.591 --> 13:14.194
Uncle? Hera. Impressive.

13:14.294 --> 13:18.999
It's meant to be. It took five years and
a thousand men to build her temple.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.700
Hera is the patron goddess of Thrace.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.739

how Hera seeks to destroy Hercules.

You killed the giant
Geryon with a single blow,

- Hercules is probably tired.

And the Labor of the Hide,

- Amphiaraus?

The famed seer of Argos.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.101
It is said you have
glimpsed your own death,

17:15.201 --> 17:19.772
so you fight each battle knowing
that it is not yet your time to die.

half horse, half human.</i>

18:34.915 --> 18:36.049
Centaurs?

18:36.149 --> 18:39.884
- You've actually seen them?
- They have been seen.

18:42.122 --> 18:48.092
COTYS: Come, Hercules. Let me show
you what misery Rhesus has brought us.

18:50.964 --> 18:55.201
Every week, more refugees
arrive seeking my protection,

18:55.301 --> 18:59.973
most of them covered in blood,
crippled or burnt by Rhesus' men.

19:00.073 --> 19:05.144
I feared nothing could ever be
good again, till you arrived.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.412
I'm just a mercenary
fighting for gold.

19:08.882 --> 19:12.652
How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.222
How others perceive us is important.

19:15.322 --> 19:20.892
And your name, like it or
not, is a rallying cry.

19:26.632 --> 19:30.904
I have seen too much reality to trust
in legends, and I am not alone.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.972
Nobody has any faith anymore.

19:34.373 --> 19:39.713
The people need a hero.
They need someone to look up to.

19:39.813 --> 19:44.048
My son believes in you.

19:44.251 --> 19:50.655
Bring us peace, and...
I will believe in you, too.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.733
I'm convinced these are good people.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.136
I see. And who's more convincing,
Cotys or his daughter?

20:04.236 --> 20:07.174
All the gold on Earth is not as
convincing as a pair of breasts.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.509
Maybe, but gold never ages.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.778
Which is why I got them
to double our price.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.482
Double your weight in gold?
(LAUGHS) Well done.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.051
- Amphiaraus?
- If it be the will of Zeus.

20:18.151 --> 20:22.029
Which title sounds more terrifying to
our enemies? "Hercules: Savior of Thrace"

20:22.129 --> 20:26.625
- or "Hercules: A Legend is Born"?
- Both sound terrifyingly boring.

20:27.393 --> 20:31.128
What are we supposed to
do with an army of farmers?

20:33.200 --> 20:34.567
Train them.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.435
- Oh, shit.
- (CHUCKLES)

20:43.109 --> 20:47.180
In war, there is one thing
more important than killing.

20:47.280 --> 20:53.286
Surviving. My companions and I
will show you how to stay alive,

20:53.386 --> 20:58.055
so that you may return home
to your farms someday.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.762

21:21.882 --> 21:24.450

21:24.751 --> 21:27.788

21:27.888 --> 21:31.191
Dead. Dead.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.090
Very dead.

21:34.327 --> 21:38.231
Soldier, many lives depend on you.

21:38.331 --> 21:41.666
When attacked, lock your
feet in the ground.

21:43.870 --> 21:47.007
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

21:47.107 --> 21:52.278
When a shield wall is strong,
nothing can ever defeat it!

21:52.579 --> 21:55.814
You must learn to work together,
react together.

21:56.015 --> 21:59.919
When you do, each individual
will become a link in a chain

22:00.019 --> 22:03.054
that will be stronger than iron.

22:07.127 --> 22:09.894
I hope the enemy has
a sense of humor.

22:10.696 --> 22:14.867
Right. Today's lesson,
how not to stab yourselves!

22:15.468 --> 22:20.407
It is imperative that we strike now,
My Lord, given this opportunity.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.742
COTYS: Ah! There you are!

22:22.842 --> 22:26.980
Hercules, my scouts have
brought news. Rhesus is on the move.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.149
Archers who shoot lightning
from their bows.

22:29.249 --> 22:33.119
And infantry 4,000-strong,
their minds bewitched.

22:33.219 --> 22:36.956
- Demons march with them.
- So now we're fighting demons.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.959
No stranger than the monsters
I hear you faced, Hercules.

22:40.059 --> 22:43.830
My Lord, Rhesus is preparing
to attack Bessi lands.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.632
He will be on them within six days.

22:45.732 --> 22:49.402
If the Bessi fall, we're next.
Unless we intercept him.

22:49.502 --> 22:52.839
Your men need weeks, if not months,
of training before they're ready.

22:52.939 --> 22:56.242
The Bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe.

22:56.342 --> 22:59.913
If we do not protect them,
then there will be a bloodbath.

23:00.013 --> 23:03.483
Face Rhesus with an untrained army and you
risk losing far more than a single battle.

23:03.583 --> 23:09.053
My Lord, Rhesus is coming.
I vouch my life on it.

23:09.322 --> 23:11.423
The longer Rhesus lives,

23:11.523 --> 23:16.362
the more villages will be burnt and
the more innocents will be killed.

23:16.462 --> 23:20.798
Assemble your men. We march tomorrow.

23:22.234 --> 23:26.506
Hercules, the gods have
offered us a gift.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.308
We must not squander it.

23:28.408 --> 23:31.778
Are your gods going
to be fighting with us?

23:31.878 --> 23:36.347
No. The son of Zeus will.

I protect you from him.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.495

should favor the company of your men.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.449
Tydeus is my most loyal warrior.

25:53.186 --> 25:59.723
He was born in war. When I found
him, he was more animal than human.

26:02.528 --> 26:08.265
He never speaks of what he saw.
He never speaks at all.

26:08.401 --> 26:11.935
But he relives it every night.

- HERCULES: Like me?
- No hero is greater than Hercules.

26:28.588 --> 26:32.394
I know all your Labors. Like the Cretan
Bull, you wrestled it for seven days

26:32.494 --> 26:34.627
- and seven nights.
- Uh, that's a bit exaggerated.

26:34.727 --> 26:38.464
- And struck it 49 times with your club.
- Maybe not quite that many.

26:38.564 --> 26:42.835
Until it fell dead and Crete was saved.
It's my favorite Labor.

- My mother saves people's lives.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.134
Many of our physicians
were killed during battle.

27:15.234 --> 27:19.836
So, out of necessity, I taught
myself the art of healing.

27:20.239 --> 27:24.877
If I could be like you, I would protect all
of Thrace and no one would ever get hurt.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.966
Only a hero may wear this.

27:47.066 --> 27:50.901
But to become a hero,
you must grow strong.

- Odysseus!

28:22.668 --> 28:24.303

28:24.403 --> 28:29.273
Or if you're lucky, you'll go to Hades,
where all the fun people are.

28:36.783 --> 28:40.552
Iolaus. Your place is beside
Lord Cotys, where it's safe.

the wall is your armor.

Murder, of a woman

Is it true? Did Hercules
slaughter his own family?

- Oh, soldiers talk.

ever returns to Athens,

49:05.843 --> 49:08.711
King Eurystheus will
have him executed.

49:12.850 --> 49:16.121
Hercules had completed his Labors
and returned home. But Hera...

49:16.221 --> 49:19.024
No myths. I want the truth.

49:19.124 --> 49:21.590
No one knows the truth.

49:22.093 --> 49:23.819
Not for sure.

49:23.919 --> 49:28.733
We found Hercules alone. His wife,
Megara and the children, dead.

49:28.833 --> 49:32.969
- He remembers nothing.
- Do you believe he is innocent?

49:33.752 --> 49:38.543
We grew up together, both orphans,
trying to survive in the streets of Athens.

49:38.643 --> 49:43.014
We found a home in the army.
Looked out for each other.

49:43.114 --> 49:47.284
Hercules' strength set him apart.

49:47.985 --> 49:51.322
Kings of Athens started to send him
on all the most dangerous missions.

49:51.422 --> 49:54.993
- The Twelve Labors.
- And he took me with him.

49:55.093 --> 49:59.929
To fight by his side. And with
each mission, our numbers grew.

the royal family had been assassinated.

50:04.368 --> 50:07.105

Everyone was gone.

50:07.205 --> 50:09.974

avenge their murder.

He became my brother-in-arms.

50:12.710 --> 50:18.317

where we found a single child,

50:18.417 --> 50:20.585

Hercules took Tydeus in when everyone
else saw nothing but a wild animal.

50:32.629 --> 50:36.267

been performed by a mere mortal.

We call it the Blood Rage.

51:04.262 --> 51:06.831

He made me vow to keep
the world away from him.

never harm innocents again.
