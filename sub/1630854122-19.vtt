But in my experience,

10:23.588 --> 10:25.970
Here's where the Venn diagram
overlaps.

Balder Osterman,

Oskar Eriksson,

10:29.180 --> 10:31.182
Ulrik Nieminen,

10:31.251 --> 10:33.736
and Einar Lindstrom.

10:33.805 --> 10:37.360
Past convictions include
battery, arson,

10:37.429 --> 10:40.398
domestic violence, and assault
with a deadly weapon.

10:40.467 --> 10:42.296
- Phone triangulations
through Swedish RAVE

10:42.365 --> 10:44.367
shows these guys
are untraceable.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.093
All of their phones
are on a VPN.

10:46.162 --> 10:47.336
What a coincidence.

10:47.405 --> 10:48.682
- So they're organized.
- Question is,

10:48.751 --> 10:51.305
who's organizing them
and for what purpose.

10:51.374 --> 10:53.204
- What do we got on Karlsson?

10:53.273 --> 10:55.724
- Johan Karlsson, 23.

10:55.793 --> 10:58.830
Born in Gothenburg.
No record to speak of.

10:58.899 --> 11:00.176
- Doesn't fit the mold.

11:00.245 --> 11:02.523
- So why did he lie to us?

11:02.592 --> 11:05.457
- Because he's not
in the club yet.

11:05.526 --> 11:08.184
He covers for them.
Seen spouting off to the feds

11:08.253 --> 11:10.290
could get him bumped up
from the kids' table.

11:10.359 --> 11:12.602
- Karlsson's not on VPN.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.813
- I can track his data to run
a cloud-based movement analysis.

11:15.882 --> 11:17.435
And with Karlsson's
digital footprints,

11:17.504 --> 11:20.231
we can pinpoint
his actual footprints--

11:20.300 --> 11:23.096
triangulating location data,
social media posts,

11:23.165 --> 11:25.512
credit card transactions,
biometric scans.

11:25.581 --> 11:26.927
- I'm just
thinking out loud here.

11:26.996 --> 11:28.411
What about the girlfriend?

11:28.480 --> 11:30.690
This is her town, right?
Could this have been a setup?

11:30.759 --> 11:32.243
- She admitted
she'd been to the pub before.

11:32.312 --> 11:33.485
Could be a connection there.

11:33.554 --> 11:35.315
- Social media looked like
they were happy.

11:35.384 --> 11:37.489
But when does it not?
- I'll look into it.

11:37.558 --> 11:40.458
- Got him.

11:40.527 --> 11:43.323
Karlsson's life in GPS form.

11:43.392 --> 11:46.257
- Home, work, bar, gym, repeat.

11:46.326 --> 11:48.431
- One set of coordinates
jumps out.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.261
On Tuesdays at 10:00 p.m.,

11:50.330 --> 11:53.436
Karlsson has been going to an
abandoned brewery in Lokholmen.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.474
They closed shop in 2015.

12:01.617 --> 12:03.619
- We got eyes on your BK,
Smitty.

12:03.688 --> 12:06.795
- A few new faces as well,
all mean-looking.

12:06.864 --> 12:09.901
We'll turn on
real-time monitoring.

12:09.970 --> 12:14.112
- Cross-checking the footage
against our offender list.

12:14.181 --> 12:17.253
- Yeah, none of these guys are
on Bergstrom's BK roster.

12:17.322 --> 12:19.462
- So who are they?

12:21.223 --> 12:22.362
- Hold there.

12:22.431 --> 12:24.191
That's the AIF Malmo logo,

12:24.260 --> 12:26.435
a different Swedish team.

12:26.504 --> 12:29.093
- I count at least three
other clubs being repped.

12:29.162 --> 12:30.266
- So someone's pulling

12:30.335 --> 12:32.061
different hardcore ultras
together.

12:32.130 --> 12:34.650
- What the hell is going on
inside that warehouse?

12:34.719 --> 12:36.756
- On it.
We'll keep you updated.

12:45.178 --> 12:46.420
What's the plan?

12:49.147 --> 12:51.184

15:39.076 --> 15:40.215
- Yeah, me and Powell,
we go way back.

15:40.284 --> 15:43.149
This is agent Andre Raines.

15:43.218 --> 15:45.289
- You just brought the Fly Team
to my undercover op.

15:45.358 --> 15:46.911
Left hand not talking
to the right hand?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.050
- Yeah, well,
an American was killed

15:48.119 --> 15:49.534
outside the Leonmein Pub
last night.

15:49.603 --> 15:51.019
- We suspect
one of your punching bags

15:51.088 --> 15:52.192
in there was involved.

15:52.261 --> 15:53.573
- Man, that dude
was an American?

15:53.642 --> 15:55.195
- Wait, wait.
You knew about this?

15:55.264 --> 15:56.921
- Yeah, I was drinking inside
when it happened.

16:01.857 --> 16:03.307
Listen,

16:03.376 --> 16:05.619
because what's happening here,
it's heavy duty,

16:05.688 --> 16:07.311
and it goes way beyond
Swedish ultras.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.484
- No, hold on.

16:08.553 --> 16:09.658
Should we loop in
your handling agent?

16:09.727 --> 16:11.453
- No, I'll reach out directly.

16:16.665 --> 16:18.943
So good to see you, brother.

16:21.635 --> 16:23.258
- What the hell was that?

16:23.327 --> 16:25.467
- That means we either have an
ace in the hole working with us

16:25.536 --> 16:28.470
or our whole op
is about to go up in flames.

16:30.265 --> 16:32.232
- Just spoke
with the Finnish Poliisi--

16:32.301 --> 16:35.063
European lead
on Powell's joint case.

16:35.132 --> 16:36.547
This undercover op

16:36.616 --> 16:40.482
is a takedown
of the Norseman Brotherhood,

16:40.551 --> 16:42.794
an ultranationalist
terrorist cell

16:42.863 --> 16:45.004
with ties to Swedish ultras.

16:45.073 --> 16:47.558
They operate out of eight hubs
called nests

16:47.627 --> 16:49.111
across Scandinavia.

16:49.180 --> 16:50.388
- Responsible for attacks

16:50.457 --> 16:52.356
on last year's
Stockholm Pride parade,

16:52.425 --> 16:54.323
including
multiple asylum centers,

16:54.392 --> 16:57.395
so clearly, they have a problem
with minority communities.

16:57.464 --> 16:59.259
- As well as leftist groups
who have the goal

16:59.328 --> 17:02.331
to challenge the
Norseman Brotherhood's rhetoric.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.679
Threaten their Aryan utopia,
they put a target on your back.

17:05.748 --> 17:08.474
- I think we're safe
to write off Blum as a suspect.

17:08.544 --> 17:10.029
- "Swedish streets
are no longer safe

17:10.098 --> 17:11.961
"for ordinary Swedes.

17:12.031 --> 17:16.137
Only by spilling blood
will we eradicate the problem."

17:16.207 --> 17:18.313
They're talking about
people like Rojas.

17:18.382 --> 17:20.108
- Europol tried for years
to embed someone

17:20.176 --> 17:21.730
in the Norseman Brotherhood.

17:21.799 --> 17:24.801
Looks like Powell succeeded
where Europol failed.

17:24.871 --> 17:26.079
- What's the scouting report?

17:26.147 --> 17:27.529
- Seven years back,
Powell and I

17:27.598 --> 17:29.324
were the hostage rescue
component attached

17:29.393 --> 17:31.671
to the DoD special ops team
in Port-au-Prince.

17:31.740 --> 17:33.224
- Yeah, that op was part
of a case study

17:33.293 --> 17:35.054
while I was at Quantico.

17:35.123 --> 17:38.264
Insurgents shot down
your chopper, right?

17:38.333 --> 17:42.095
- Powell and I were
the only survivors.

17:42.164 --> 17:44.166
Our orders
from the QR team

17:44.235 --> 17:46.962
were to get
to the extraction point.

17:47.031 --> 17:49.171
Powell was acting lead.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.311
But he pretended
that his radio was broken,

17:51.380 --> 17:53.693
and we went on foot
through 30 miles of jungle

17:53.762 --> 17:56.144
and a half a dozen Mawozo.

17:56.213 --> 17:58.560
We rescued the hostages.

17:58.629 --> 18:00.424
The mission was a success,
but...

18:00.493 --> 18:02.805
- He disobeyed orders.
- And there's the rub.

18:02.874 --> 18:07.051
Powell is one of the 10% agents
that does 90% of the work,

18:07.120 --> 18:09.295
but he has got a problem
with authority.

18:09.364 --> 18:11.469
And it does not lend well
to advancement in the Bureau.

18:11.538 --> 18:12.781
- That could be why
he's getting his ass kicked

18:12.850 --> 18:14.196
by skinheads.

18:14.265 --> 18:16.233
- Powell's handler,
Special Agent Albert Judd,

18:16.302 --> 18:18.614
is in the conference room.

18:24.172 --> 18:26.001
- Heard you ran into my UC.

18:26.070 --> 18:27.382
Powell give you problems?

18:27.451 --> 18:29.763
- Thanks for coming.
Since our cases overlap,

18:29.832 --> 18:33.250
we'd like to know exactly
what kind of heat we're facing.

18:33.319 --> 18:35.735
- Well, a few years back,
Joint Terrorism in Richmond

18:35.804 --> 18:38.220
tried to take down
a regional far right cell.

18:38.289 --> 18:40.429
Found out they were being
bankrolled from overseas.

18:40.498 --> 18:42.880
Now, since you have
to pull a weed out by the root,

18:42.949 --> 18:44.502
we got one of our guys in.

18:44.571 --> 18:47.540
Found out they were recruiting
violent soccer ultras

18:47.609 --> 18:49.369
via underground street fights,

18:49.438 --> 18:52.683
channeling their fandom
into something worse.

18:52.752 --> 18:55.168
Powell's been building street
cred with the Stockholm nest.

18:55.237 --> 18:56.756
- And how long has this case
been going on for?

18:56.825 --> 18:58.240
- 13 months.

18:58.309 --> 19:00.242
- That's a long time
to keep an agent embedded.

19:00.311 --> 19:02.279
- Yeah, well,
my slow and steady approach

19:02.348 --> 19:04.384
has yielded dividends.

19:04.453 --> 19:07.111
We now know the leader
of their Stockholm nest,

19:07.180 --> 19:08.595
Einar Lindstrom.

19:08.664 --> 19:11.288
I'm still looking
for the main shot caller

19:11.357 --> 19:13.462
who lives somewhere else
in the region.

19:13.531 --> 19:16.362
I'll find him in due time.

19:16.431 --> 19:19.019
- Powell suggested
that they were ramping up

19:19.088 --> 19:20.228
for something imminent.

19:20.297 --> 19:21.160
- You only move
when you have enough

19:21.229 --> 19:22.678
to bring down everything,

19:22.747 --> 19:24.853
which means I am only
running this up the flagpole

19:24.922 --> 19:28.374
when Powell brings me
something actionable, which--

19:28.443 --> 19:31.066
well, surprise, surprise,
he hasn't done yet.

19:31.135 --> 19:32.481
I understand you're looking

19:32.550 --> 19:34.311
into the homicide
of an American citizen.

19:34.380 --> 19:35.726
- We suspect a hate crime.

19:35.795 --> 19:38.384
- Well, Powell should tell you
what he knows.

19:38.453 --> 19:40.800
He should tell you.
Now, will he?

19:40.869 --> 19:42.664
That's another story entirely.

19:42.733 --> 19:44.459
- If he's gone rogue,
why haven't you pulled him?

19:44.528 --> 19:47.738
- Well, Powell wasn't the
first agent we tried to put in.

19:47.807 --> 19:49.809
He's just the only one
who could hack it.

19:49.878 --> 19:54.227
He assimilated quickly enough
with the Norseman Brotherhood.

19:54.296 --> 19:56.333
- I got an address.

19:56.402 --> 19:59.232
Powell's flare.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.352
- I told you not to go
to my handler.

20:15.421 --> 20:18.078
That dude, he's rogue,
retired on active duty.

20:18.147 --> 20:19.494
He'd be a pig in the mud
if this op went

20:19.563 --> 20:21.461
for another decade, with
his cushy paid-for apartment,

20:21.530 --> 20:23.083
his local girlfriend
on the side,

20:23.152 --> 20:24.257
submitting expense reports

20:24.326 --> 20:25.534
while I'm putting my life
on the line.

20:25.603 --> 20:27.674
- Damien, we're past this.
Do not manage me.

20:27.743 --> 20:28.986
Who killed Rojas?

20:29.055 --> 20:30.229
- Yeah, and of all the bars
in Stockholm.

20:30.298 --> 20:32.748
- Damien, spit it out.

20:32.817 --> 20:34.233
Who murdered him?

20:34.302 --> 20:35.544
- Einar Lindstrom.

20:35.613 --> 20:37.339
- The nest leader?
- Yeah, he's a bad dude.

20:37.408 --> 20:39.203
The last guy you'd want to see
in a back alley,

20:39.272 --> 20:40.687
as Rojas found out
the hard way.

20:40.756 --> 20:43.000
- How did you know it was him?
- Because I overheard.

20:43.069 --> 20:45.140
These guys had been drinking
since the bar opened,

20:45.209 --> 20:46.693
telling everybody
within earshot.

20:46.762 --> 20:50.214
It's like these jackals wanted
a prize for what they did.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.251
And I'm gonna give them some,
all right.

20:55.150 --> 20:56.841
God, the things that I seen.

20:56.910 --> 21:00.466
You don't know
what it's been like, man.

21:00.535 --> 21:03.848
- Help us make our case
against Einar.

21:03.917 --> 21:06.437
We get them, we get you out.

21:06.506 --> 21:08.612
- Look, look,
I feel for Rojas, I do,

21:08.681 --> 21:10.338
but I've been on this thing
since the jump,

21:10.407 --> 21:11.580
breathing in their exhaust

21:11.649 --> 21:12.926
for over a year now
to get this close.

21:12.995 --> 21:16.758
I can't--I can't stop now.

21:16.827 --> 21:18.587
The troops are gathering.

21:20.451 --> 21:21.728
The nests are coming into town.

21:21.797 --> 21:23.040
The Norseman Brotherhood
is planning

21:23.109 --> 21:24.559
a full-on statement attack.
- Against who?

21:24.628 --> 21:25.801
- This is what
I keep telling Judd.

21:25.870 --> 21:28.563
I'm this close,
but I need more time.

21:28.632 --> 21:30.772
Because Einar's bringing in
the big fish tonight,

21:30.841 --> 21:33.499
the one with the plan.
- Where?

21:33.568 --> 21:35.570
- Mariaberget Lookout,
midnight.

21:35.639 --> 21:37.088
And I don't know much, but

32:07.201 --> 32:09.272

32:09.341 --> 32:11.239
Powell's testimony

32:11.308 --> 32:12.516
We tried bringing in Bergstrom,

32:12.585 --> 32:16.244

into her purview.

32:45.101 --> 32:47.344

32:50.451 --> 32:52.177
the Norseman Brotherhood
