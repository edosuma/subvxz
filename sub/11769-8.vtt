FOR BOB'S 40th BIRTHDAY,

02:55.133 --> 02:57.300
WHAT I WANT TO DO
IS TO GIVE HIM,

02:57.333 --> 03:00.067

WHERE EACH PERSON DOES A PAGE.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.667
YOU KNOW

03:01.700 --> 03:02.767
WHAT DO YOU MEAN A PAGE ?
WHAT KIND OF PAGE ?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.167

ANYTHING YOU WANT.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.800
LIKE, IF YOU WOULD
DRAW SOMETHING,

03:05.833 --> 03:07.500
YOU COULD
DO AN ART PIECE,

03:07.533 --> 03:10.467
AND YOU COULD WRITE
A RECOLLECTION OF BOB,

03:10.500 --> 03:13.200
OR A POEM OR SOMETHING
YOU CAN SHARE.

03:13.233 --> 03:16.200
MAKE IT FUNNY, WOULD BE GREAT
IF YOU COULD MAKE IT FUNNY.

03:16.233 --> 03:18.700

03:18.733 --> 03:20.100

03:20.133 --> 03:21.133
THAT'D BE AN HONOR.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.067
LARRY, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO DO THAT ?

03:23.100 --> 03:24.867

03:26.367 --> 03:28.700
WELL, I MEAN, I HAVE
A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME.

03:28.733 --> 03:31.367
I'VE GOT HIS LETTER

03:31.400 --> 03:34.067
YOU KNOW, BOB'S THING
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A BIG THING.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.567
YOU COULD DO THAT.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.633

05:06.900 --> 05:09.500
WHAT WAS ALL THAT
GOODBYE BUSINESS ?

05:09.533 --> 05:10.833

EMBARRASSING.

05:10.867 --> 05:12.967

05:15.233 --> 05:16.200
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.300
WHAT ?

05:17.333 --> 05:18.367
SOMETIMES YOU FORGET

05:18.400 --> 05:19.467
I FORGET TO SAY
GOODBYE TO PEOPLE ?

05:19.500 --> 05:21.100
NEVER IN MY LIFE
HAVE I FORGOTTEN.

05:21.133 --> 05:22.367
YES, YOU HAVE.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.067
AND THEN PEOPLE THINK THAT
YOU'RE DOING IT INTENTIONALLY.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.467
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.233
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I PAID FOR THAT DINNER ?

05:29.267 --> 05:31.200
I JUST KEPT PUTTING

05:31.233 --> 05:32.267
WHY DIDN'T
THEY STOP ME ?

05:32.300 --> 05:33.633
WHY DID YOU KEEP
PUTTING MONEY DOWN ?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.200
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T,

05:35.233 --> 05:36.267
THERE YOU GO,

IS THAT ENOUGH ?

05:39.067 --> 05:40.633

05:40.667 --> 05:44.067
OH, I HOPE MY PARENTS
FOUND SOMETHING TO EAT.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.967
I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT THAT.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.867
HOW LONG ARE THEY
STAYING FOR, ANYWAY ?

05:47.900 --> 05:50.067
THEY'RE STAYING
'TIL NEXT WEEK,

05:50.067 --> 05:53.067
WHEN WE GO TO MONTERREY

05:54.567 --> 05:55.933

IT DOESN'T WORK
BECAUSE THAT--

05:55.967 --> 05:56.933

OKAY, ALRIGHT !

05:56.967 --> 05:58.667

08:23.900 --> 08:27.567

OKAY.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.300

WHAT IS THAT ?

09:37.067 --> 09:38.600
WHAT DO YOU

09:38.633 --> 09:40.067
UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

09:40.067 --> 09:41.567
YOU KNOW, YOU OUGHTA

09:41.600 --> 09:42.967

09:48.700 --> 09:50.767
HE'S THE LAKERS' DOCTOR,
GO ASK HIM.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.600
BUT HE'S AN ORTHOPEDIC,
RIGHT ?

09:52.633 --> 09:53.667
THEY GOTTA KNOW
ALL THE STUFF.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.067
HE CAN TELL YOU
AND LOOK AT IT AND GO,

09:55.067 --> 09:56.733
"THAT'S SOMETHING
OR NOTHING."

09:56.767 --> 09:58.833
IF HE TELLS YOU IT'S NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT, THEN YOU'RE FINE.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.433
I'M GONNA GO
HIT SOME BALLS.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.900
I'LL SEE YOU

10:13.100 --> 10:16.300
I GOT A LITTLE THING
ON MY BACK AND I WAS HOPING

10:16.333 --> 10:19.167
YOU COULD SAVE ME
A VISIT TO A DERMATOLOGIST.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.600
I'M SORRY,
I'M RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.

10:21.633 --> 10:24.167
WELL, IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SECOND
TO TAKE QUICK LOOK AT IT.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.900
I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING
AND YOU COULD JUST
TELL ME IF IT'S--

10:26.933 --> 10:27.967
YOU CAN MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT

10:28.000 --> 10:29.100
AND JUST COME ON DOWN
TO THE OFFICE.

10:29.133 --> 10:31.167
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO LOOK AT IT THERE.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.100
I MEAN, IT WOULD
JUST TAKE A SECOND.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.433
JUST SAY IS IT SOMETHING
OR NOTHING OR, YOU KNOW.

10:35.467 --> 10:38.000
IT'S LIKE LOOKING

10:38.033 --> 10:39.300
WHAT DO YOU
DO FOR A LIVING ?

10:39.333 --> 10:40.633
I'M A WRITER.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.067
NEXT TIME YOU'RE

10:42.100 --> 10:45.167
WHY DON'T YOU WRITE ME
A BUNCH OF SHIT FOR FREE ?

10:55.267 --> 10:57.367
ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS
TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT IT.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.767
WOULD IT HAVE
KILLED HIM ?

10:58.800 --> 10:59.900
THE DOCTOR ?

11:00.067 --> 11:01.067

12:21.767 --> 12:23.067
HE SHOULD PUT HIM

12:23.067 --> 12:24.100
MAYBE HE'S UPSET.

12:24.133 --> 12:26.367

AND NOT ONLY THAT, ONE OF
THE REPORTERS THINKS THAT,

14:27.933 --> 14:30.100
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A MOTIVE,
BECAUSE YOU'RE A KNICKS' FAN.

14:30.133 --> 14:32.133
OH, YEAH, YEAH,

15:48.567 --> 15:50.700
WHAT CAN I DO ?
CAN I DO ANYTHING ?

15:50.733 --> 15:52.067
BUY THE TEAM.

15:52.067 --> 15:55.067
THAT WOULD BE A HELP.

16:04.833 --> 16:05.800
HEY, CHUCK.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.400
HEY, LARRY,
HOW ARE YOU DOING ?

16:07.433 --> 16:08.467
OKAY.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.433
WHAT HAPPENED AT
THE GAME LAST NIGHT, HUH ?

16:10.467 --> 16:13.067
I MEAN, SHAQ IS
COMING OFF THE BENCH,

16:13.067 --> 16:16.233
YOU GOT YOUR LEGS STRETCHED OUT,
I MEAN, THE GUY JUST TRIPS.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.733
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.200
I KNOW,
YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

16:19.233 --> 16:21.633
YOU'RE SITTING THERE, YOU KNOW,
YOU SEE A PLAYER COMING,

16:21.667 --> 16:23.633
IT'S A BIG,
MOUNTAIN OF A GUY.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.933
YOU GOT TO BE ABLE
TO SEE HIM, YOU KNOW.

16:25.967 --> 16:27.300
I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.333
IT WAS A STUPID THING,
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

16:29.367 --> 16:33.500
BUT, I MEAN, WITHOUT SHAQ,
WE CAN'T WIN THIS, YOU KNOW ?

16:34.133 --> 16:37.500
OH, LARRY.

16:37.533 --> 16:38.867
HOW MUCH MORE CLEAR
CAN I BE ?

16:38.900 --> 16:40.700
NO COMMENT.

16:40.733 --> 16:41.900
ALRIGHT, THANK YOU.

16:41.933 --> 16:44.367
UM...

16:44.400 --> 16:48.233
YOU'VE GOT
A BOATLOAD OF MESSAGES,

16:48.267 --> 16:51.633
AND WHEN THE PHONE
WASN'T RINGING,
FAXES WERE COMING IN.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.267
I WANT TO TRY TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH SHAQUILLE O'NEAL, OKAY ?

16:54.300 --> 16:58.367
SO, FIND OUT WHERE HE IS,
HE MIGHT BE IN A HOSPITAL.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.800
I DON'T KNOW.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.300
( phone )

17:01.333 --> 17:02.500
DON'T, FORGET IT,

17:05.100 --> 17:07.500
I WANT TO GET
"SEINFELD TAPES", IF YOU CAN.

17:07.533 --> 17:10.067

17:10.067 --> 17:15.133
HAVE YOU EVER DONE A PAGE
IN A BIRTHDAY BOOK ?

17:18.067 --> 17:21.333

17:25.067 --> 17:27.233
OH YEAH, ALL THE MAGAZINE SHOWS

17:27.267 --> 17:29.133
THEY'RE GONNA DO A SPREAD.

17:29.167 --> 17:30.133
I'M GOING HOME.

17:30.167 --> 17:32.167
OH, HEY, NO GOODBYE ?

18:07.433 --> 18:09.067
NO, PUT IT WHEREVER

18:09.100 --> 18:10.433
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

18:10.467 --> 18:12.267
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.600
WELL, WE'RE LEAVING.

18:13.633 --> 18:14.867
YOU'RE WHAT ?

18:14.900 --> 18:16.067
WE'RE LEAVING.

18:16.067 --> 18:17.067
IT'S A LITTLE TOO BUSY
AROUND HERE FOR US.

18:17.100 --> 18:18.700
YEAH, A LITTLE TOO MUCH
COMMOTION FOR US.

18:18.733 --> 18:19.967
REALLY, YOU'RE GOING ?

18:20.067 --> 18:21.933
WE'LL LEAVE YOU
WITH YOUR CHAOS, OKAY ?

18:21.967 --> 18:23.133
HOLY MACKEREL.

18:23.167 --> 18:26.067

WOULDN'T LEAVE SO SOON.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.700
WELL, IT'S TIME,
HONEY.

18:27.733 --> 18:29.067
GOODBYE.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.400
DAD, DON'T YOU WANT TO STAY
A LITTLE BIT LONGER ?

18:31.433 --> 18:34.467
ALRIGHT, WELL,
IF YOU RECONSIDER,
YOU CAN COME BACK.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.400
GOOD LUCK
WITH YOUR TELEPHONE.

18:36.433 --> 18:40.600
THAT'S SAD,
IT'S SAD.

18:40.633 --> 18:43.933
DON'T YOU
SAY GOODBYE ?

18:48.133 --> 18:50.600
THEY WERE
IN A HURRY.

18:50.633 --> 18:52.600
OH, IT'S A LITTLE RUDE,
YOU KNOW ?

18:52.633 --> 18:55.133
WELL, BOY.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.767
TOO MUCH TURMOIL

18:57.800 --> 18:59.067

18:59.100 --> 19:03.467
LARRY, OH, I'M SO GLAD
I CAUGHT YOU AT HOME.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.967
I'M SO GLAD.

19:05.067 --> 19:07.167
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
GOT STARTED ON THAT PAGE

19:07.200 --> 19:09.133
FOR BOB'S BIRTHDAY BOOK.

19:09.167 --> 19:10.833
YOU KNOW WHY ?

19:10.867 --> 19:12.933
UH, 'CAUSE
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

19:12.967 --> 19:15.600
I JUST DECIDED
IT WAS TOO OVERWHELMING,

19:15.633 --> 19:17.600
AND I THOUGHT,
GET HIM SOME COLOGNE.

19:17.633 --> 19:20.467
I'VE BEEN GIVING THIS THING
SOME THOUGHT, YOU KNOW.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.200
I'M SORRY, I FEEL...

19:22.233 --> 19:24.067
I WAS GONNA
DO A BASKETBALL,

19:24.067 --> 19:26.200
I WAS GOING TO FORGE SOME
OF THE LAKERS' SIGNATURES ON IT,

19:26.233 --> 19:27.367
YOU KNOW, AND...

19:27.400 --> 19:28.667
REALLY ?

19:28.700 --> 19:30.133
YEAH, AND THEN I WAS GONNA
WRITE A COUPLE OF, UH...

19:30.167 --> 19:33.733
MY MEMORIES FROM THE TWO TIMES
WE HAD DINNER TOGETHER AND...

19:33.767 --> 19:35.233
OH, I FEEL BAD.

19:35.267 --> 19:36.600
I CAN SEE THAT
YOU'RE UPSET.

19:36.633 --> 19:40.500
I HAD A BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW WITH
"I LOVE YOU BOB", AND...

19:40.533 --> 19:42.833
REALLY,
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

19:42.867 --> 19:44.867
AND I'M SURE, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S SOME KIND OF THING

19:44.900 --> 19:46.867
YOU CAN DEVELOP WITH IT
AT SOME POINT.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.833
HOW DID THE OTHER
ACQUAINTANCES TAKE IT, OKAY ?

19:48.867 --> 19:50.467
YOU KNOW,
THEY WERE FINE.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.567

20:00.267 --> 20:08.700

IN THE BIRTHDAY BOOK.

20:08.733 --> 20:10.833
NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE...

20:10.867 --> 20:12.867
APPARENTLY, ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME,

20:12.900 --> 20:14.933
BECAUSE OF
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.

20:14.967 --> 20:16.867
THAT'S KIND OF SAD.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.700
SAD ?

20:18.733 --> 20:19.867
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY ?

20:19.900 --> 20:22.400
I'M GONNA GO TO STARBUCKS

20:22.433 --> 20:23.567
STARBUCKS, WAIT,

20:23.600 --> 20:25.400

A VANILLA,

20:42.800 --> 20:45.100
ONE OF THE VANILLA
BULLSHIT THINGS.

20:45.133 --> 20:47.700
YOU KNOW, YOU,

20:47.733 --> 20:49.800
SOME VANILLA BULLSHIT,
LATTE CAPPA-THING.

20:49.833 --> 20:53.467
WHATEVER YOU GOT,
I DON'T CARE.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.500
WHAT ?

20:54.533 --> 20:56.300

21:28.333 --> 21:29.633
IT'S A SHAME, THOUGH.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.600

21:35.800 --> 21:38.500

HE'LL LIKE IT ?

24:14.333 --> 24:15.667
YEAH, HE LOVES IT,
IT'S HIS FAVORITE SHOW.

24:15.700 --> 24:16.667
GREAT.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.267
SO HOW THINGS
BEEN GOING ?

24:18.300 --> 24:19.700
NEVER BEEN BETTER.

24:19.733 --> 24:21.200
OH, GOOD.

24:21.233 --> 24:22.733
WHAT DO YOU GOT,
BIG GUY ?

24:22.767 --> 24:25.200
PEANUT BUTTER.

24:25.233 --> 24:28.567
DAIRY PRODUCT,
PEANUT BUTTER.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.567
NO, NO.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.600
WHAT YOU MEAN, NO ?

24:30.633 --> 24:32.433
PEANUT BUTTER IS NOT
A DAIRY PRODUCT.

24:32.467 --> 24:34.067
IT'S NOT DAIRY.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.867
THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS
PEANUT BUTTER
IS A DAIRY PRODUCT.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.133
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

24:38.167 --> 24:40.067
DAIRY IS FROM A COW,
PEANUTS ARE NOT A DAIRY PRODUCT.

24:40.067 --> 24:41.967
PEANUT BUTTER, MOO.

24:42.067 --> 24:44.667
OKAY, PEANUTS COME FROM
THE GROUND OR SOMETHING.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.333
ALBERT, WHAT'S UP, BABY,
HOW YOU DOING ?

24:46.367 --> 24:48.067
LOOK WHO I FOUND
WANDERING THE HALLS.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.567
LARRY DAVID,
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.167
HE'S GOT SOMETHING
HE WANTS TO SAY TO YOU.

24:52.200 --> 24:57.200
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT THE INCIDENT

24:57.233 --> 24:59.867
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED.

24:59.900 --> 25:02.167
I WAS STRETCHING,
I NEVER SAT THERE BEFORE.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.200
I'M SORRY.

25:03.233 --> 25:04.833
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO HELP, "SORRY" ?

25:04.867 --> 25:06.867
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.333
I BROUGHT YOU THESE
"SEINFELD" TAPES.

25:08.367 --> 25:10.333
ALBERT TOLD ME YOU WERE
A BIG "SEINFELD" FAN.

25:10.367 --> 25:11.367

25:11.400 --> 25:14.567
I GOT YOU ALL THE TAPES
OF EVERY EPISODE.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.467
YOU HAVE EVERY TAPE
OF EVERY SHOW ?

25:16.500 --> 25:18.967
LISTEN, LISTEN...

25:19.067 --> 25:20.300
OH, SCATTERGORIES.

25:20.333 --> 25:21.300
DAIRY PRODUCTS.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.933
PEANUT BUTTER.

25:22.967 --> 25:25.900
PEANUT BUTTER, WOULD BE
CONSIDERED A DAIRY PRODUCT,

25:25.933 --> 25:26.933
AM I CORRECT ?

25:26.967 --> 25:28.300
ABSOLUTELY, BUTTER.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.333
THANK YOU.

25:30.367 --> 25:32.333
A MAN THAT
HAS SOME SENSE.

25:32.367 --> 25:36.767
OKAY, LISTEN, I'VE GOT,
PENDANT, PORSCHE, POPEYE,

25:36.800 --> 25:38.867
PAGO PAGO,

25:38.900 --> 25:40.900
DOC'S KILLING US.

25:40.933 --> 25:42.300
I'M GONNA GO TO THE CAN,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.700
TOLD YOU HE WAS SMART,
WHAT'S THE SCORE ?

25:44.733 --> 25:46.267
ALRIGHT,
WELL, NOW HE HAS 26.

25:46.300 --> 25:47.300
AND WHAT DO I HAVE ?

25:47.333 --> 25:48.333
YOU HAVE 25.

25:48.367 --> 25:49.400
AND WHAT
DO YOU GOT ?

25:49.433 --> 25:50.967
I HAVE 25.

25:51.067 --> 25:56.300
BY THE WAY, DIDN'T THE DOCTOR
MENTION FIVE ITEMS FOR "P" ?

25:56.333 --> 25:57.567
YEAH.YEAH.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.533
THERE'S NO PAGO PAGO
AND PROVOLONE ON THIS LIST,

26:00.567 --> 26:01.933
IF YOU JUST
NT TO CHECK IT OUT.

26:01.967 --> 26:03.800
OH, MY GOD.

26:03.833 --> 26:06.233
THE DOC IS CHEATING
AT SCATTERGORIES ?

26:06.267 --> 26:10.733
HE WAS OBVIOUSLY MAKING IT UP
AFTER THE TIME RAN OUT.

26:10.767 --> 26:12.633
WHY WOULD YOU CHEAT
AT SCATTERGORIES ?

26:12.667 --> 26:14.133
A DOCTOR.

26:14.167 --> 26:16.667
YOU WANT TO PLAY
ANOTHER GAME ?

26:16.700 --> 26:17.667
DOC.

26:17.700 --> 26:18.667
YEAH ?

26:18.700 --> 26:21.300
HOW CAN YOU CHEAT
AT SCATTERGORIES ?

26:21.333 --> 26:22.467
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

26:22.500 --> 26:23.967
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU GAVE US FIVE NAMES.

26:24.067 --> 26:26.733
THERE'S ONLY
THREE HERE.

26:26.767 --> 26:30.067
LISTEN, DOC,
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

26:30.067 --> 26:31.067
I'M SICK AND
TIRED OF YOU.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.067
YOU'RE FIRED,
GET OUT.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.533
ALBERT.

26:33.567 --> 26:35.133
GET THIS GUY OUT OF HERE,
YOU'RE FIRED.

26:35.167 --> 26:37.100
I WON, SHAQ.

26:37.133 --> 26:38.533
GET OUT.

26:38.567 --> 26:41.667
GET HIS ASS
OUT OF HERE.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.100
THE TIMER RAN OUT.

26:43.133 --> 26:44.100
THE TIMER DIDN'T RUN OUT,
YOU CHEATED.

26:44.133 --> 26:45.633
YOU CHEATED.

26:45.667 --> 26:46.700
IT'S THE TIMER.

26:46.733 --> 26:48.067
NO, IT'S NOT THE TIMER,
GET OUT.

26:48.067 --> 26:49.500
I WAS GONNA
WRITE IT DOWN.

26:49.533 --> 26:51.467
GET YOUR ASS OUT OF HERE,
GET OUT.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.933
YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID,
GET OUT !

26:52.967 --> 26:55.433
LET'S GO.

26:55.467 --> 26:59.300
DON'T YOU
SAY GOODBYE ?

26:59.333 --> 27:01.700
NOTICE HOW NO ONE EVER
SAYS GOODBYE ANYMORE ?

27:01.733 --> 27:03.267
HAVE YOU
NOTICED THAT ?

27:03.300 --> 27:04.633
YEAH,
I HAVE NOTICED THAT.

27:04.667 --> 27:07.100
WHY CAN'T PEOPLE LEAVE A ROOM
AND BE A LITTLE POLITE ?

27:07.133 --> 27:10.367
OKAY, MY FAVORITE
"SEINFELD" EPISODE
WAS "THE CONTEST".

27:10.400 --> 27:11.567
"THE CONTEST" ?

27:11.600 --> 27:13.100
I GOT IT,
YOU WANT "THE CONTEST" ?

27:13.133 --> 27:15.900
IF YOU POP IN "THE CONTEST",
I'LL LET BYGONES BE BYGONES

27:15.933 --> 27:17.867
AND I FORGOT
THAT YOU TRIPPED ME.

27:17.900 --> 27:20.433
PEANUT BUTTER
IS A DAIRY PRODUCT.

27:20.467 --> 27:21.500
SHAQ ?

27:21.533 --> 27:22.500
YES ?

27:22.533 --> 27:23.800
KIND OF AN ODD THING.

27:23.833 --> 27:26.067
I HAD A CHANCE TO GO BACK
AND LOOK AT YOUR FILE,

27:26.067 --> 27:27.767
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS HAPPENED,

27:27.800 --> 27:30.600
BUT IT SEEMS DR. WIGGINS
MISREAD THE M.R.I.

27:30.633 --> 27:34.867
HIS INITIAL DIAGNOSIS
OF THE COMPLETE TEAR
OF THE QUADRICEP TENDON,

27:34.900 --> 27:37.067
IT'S A PARTIAL TEAR
AT BEST.

27:37.067 --> 27:39.067
I THINK IF YOU SIT DOWN
FOR MAYBE A WEEK,

27:39.067 --> 27:40.100
YOU'LL BE BACK
TO FULL STRENGTH.

27:40.133 --> 27:41.633
THAT'S GREAT !

27:41.667 --> 27:43.233
( Larry )
ONE WEEK,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

27:44.067 --> 27:46.067
I was alone.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.600
( whistling )

28:14.067 --> 28:16.833
EXCUSE ME, I'M SORRY.

28:16.867 --> 28:18.933
COULD YOU
GIVE ME A RIDE ?

28:18.967 --> 28:20.600
THE DOCTOR.

28:20.633 --> 28:21.767
YES, FROM UPSTAIRS.

28:21.800 --> 28:22.767
YEAH.

28:22.800 --> 28:23.767
YES, HOW'S YOUR BACK ?

28:23.800 --> 28:26.700
OKAY, BARRY,
C'MON, LET'S GO.

28:26.733 --> 28:29.800
WHAT...

28:29.833 --> 28:31.067
STAY OUT OF THE SUN.

28:31.067 --> 28:33.633
HE'S NOT A DOCTOR ?

28:33.667 --> 28:36.067
SIXTH FLOOR,
PSYCHIATRIC.
