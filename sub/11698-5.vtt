WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.368
So what do you think, Emma?

00:02.369 --> 00:03.602
Should daddy
grow himself a beard?

00:03.604 --> 00:05.288
Maybe help him out
with the ladies?

00:07.307 --> 00:09.041
I think he'd have a better shot

00:09.042 --> 00:10.543
if he wasn't at home
on a Saturday night

00:10.544 --> 00:12.079
playing baby spa.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.382
How long has it been
since you've had a date?

00:16.383 --> 00:18.150
Long.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.053
Too long.
I need help, man.

00:21.688 --> 00:25.057
Ugh! What is wrong with me?
Look at this highlight reel.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.993
I keep taking the same
stupid shot over and over.

00:27.994 --> 00:29.828
You're not hitting
the rewind button

00:29.829 --> 00:31.597
on the remote again, are you?

00:31.598 --> 00:34.133
No.

00:34.134 --> 00:36.001
But it doesn't matter.

00:36.002 --> 00:38.103
My game sucks. I haven't
scored in six weeks.

00:38.104 --> 00:40.387
Oh, must run in the family.

00:42.743 --> 00:43.943
Coach thinks it's all in my head.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.846
He's actually making me go see
the team shrink tomorrow.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.280
Daniel Wheeler,

00:48.281 --> 00:50.217
sit on the couch and
tell me about your mother.

00:53.881 --> 00:55.888
I'm serious.
If I don't do something soon,

00:55.889 --> 00:57.256
- I'm gonna get traded.
- Yeah.

00:57.257 --> 00:58.457
Well, if I don't
get that promotion,

00:58.458 --> 00:59.925
I'm gonna be unbearable.

00:59.926 --> 01:03.195
Yeah, because you're
a regular pony ride now.

01:04.193 --> 01:04.864
No, seriously.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.732
What do you guys think of this?

01:08.511 --> 01:10.730
My name is Tucker Dobbs...

01:11.320 --> 01:12.914
And I'm here to tell you...

01:13.931 --> 01:17.075
Why I'm the perfect
candidate for the associate...

01:18.194 --> 01:19.353
Producer...

01:20.306 --> 01:21.633
Position.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.550
Tucker, just lose the
cards and march in there

01:24.551 --> 01:26.619
and tell them exactly why
you deserve the promotion.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.256
But maybe stand on a chair
so you seem more commanding.

01:30.957 --> 01:33.859
There's nothing you can't do
if you set your mind to it.

01:33.860 --> 01:37.196
Oh, did you give yourself that talk
before or after you decided

01:37.197 --> 01:39.565
to stay in
and do your kid's hair?

01:40.573 --> 01:41.801
You're right.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.869
There's something wrong
when the only person in the room

01:43.870 --> 01:46.239
not acting like a baby
is the baby.

01:47.307 --> 01:48.874
This slump ends tonight.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.477
We're gonna get mom to
babysit and we're going out.

01:51.478 --> 01:52.878
Whoo!

01:52.879 --> 01:54.781
What up, party animals?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.550
Great timing, mom.
Can you babysit?

01:57.551 --> 01:59.990
Yeah, sure. Just give
me 24 hours' notice.

02:00.554 --> 02:01.821
You know what the
best part about living

02:01.822 --> 02:03.389
across the street
from you guys is?

02:03.390 --> 02:05.559
I can see that I have
a life and you don't.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.794
I'm having people over tonight,

02:08.794 --> 02:11.297
and I just need to borrow
some ice, some beer,

02:11.298 --> 02:13.632
some cold cuts, and...

02:14.371 --> 02:15.826
Whatever this is.

02:17.936 --> 02:28.902
- sync and corrections by Zac -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:29.783 --> 02:30.783
I got to be honest.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.751
Kinda surprised you're
having lunch here today.

02:32.752 --> 02:37.256
- Why? It's still free, right?
- Yes, I just thought

02:37.257 --> 02:39.391
with the great and
powerful Fitch back in town,

02:39.392 --> 02:41.928
the two of you would
be... celebrating.

02:43.430 --> 02:47.499
Are there any words you
can't make sound dirty?

02:48.479 --> 02:49.501
No.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.872
Or should I say... no.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.207
So things still going well?

02:56.377 --> 02:58.711
He kind of dropped a giant
bomb on me last night.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.280
Did he break up with you?
Is he seeing someone else?

03:01.281 --> 03:03.582
You can tell me anything,
I'm a bartender.

03:04.932 --> 03:06.418
He told me he loves me.

03:07.070 --> 03:08.454
How dare he.

03:09.729 --> 03:10.723
I know.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.725
And now he wants to have
a talk about our future.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.727
And I mean, we barely
just started having

03:14.728 --> 03:16.428
a present. I mean...

03:16.429 --> 03:17.897
You don't really want to
hear all of this do you?

03:17.898 --> 03:20.666
- Of course I do. I'm all ears.
- Okay, thank you so much.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.401
- It's just...
- Hold that thought.

03:22.402 --> 03:23.802
My slump is about
to be dumped.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.273
Yup, all ears.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.631
Unfortunately
they're in his pants.

03:29.966 --> 03:32.311
Table seven, I'll
handle it from here.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.512
Trust me. There's no way

03:33.513 --> 03:34.680
they're not gonna be
totally blown away.

03:34.681 --> 03:38.183
I know I am and I don't even know
what you're talking about.

03:38.184 --> 03:39.919
I like to personally
introduce myself

03:39.920 --> 03:41.420
to all our first time
customers.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.521
I come here everyday.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.791
Do I look like
I'm talking to you?

03:46.626 --> 03:48.193
I'm Ben.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.229
Jenna, and everything
was great.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.231
Especially the cute,
attentive service.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.401
Well, if you want
something off the menu,

03:55.402 --> 03:56.503
I'm here everyday.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.575
Wow.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.844
That was all shades
of nauseating.

04:06.473 --> 04:08.380
And you didn't even get
her number.

04:08.381 --> 04:09.683
Call me.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.752
And you were saying?

04:14.387 --> 04:16.387
Hey, what's going on?
What's up?

04:16.389 --> 04:18.824
- Jenna.
- Tucker.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.360
Oh God.

04:21.894 --> 04:25.197
- Did you see that girl?
- See her? I think there's

04:25.198 --> 04:27.477
a pretty good chance
she's carrying his child.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.502
That's her. That's Jenna.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.771
The evil queen.
Lady do-nothing.

04:32.772 --> 04:36.709
My Nemesis, archenemy,
the destroyer of my soul.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.444
So you know her?

04:39.837 --> 04:41.613
That's who I'm up
against for the promotion.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.283
Dude, I probably wouldn't
get my hopes up, okay?

04:44.284 --> 04:46.279
Her table was full
of colored charts

04:46.314 --> 04:47.822
and personalized binders.

04:48.186 --> 04:50.135
Personalized binders?

04:50.570 --> 04:53.969
I should have known she'd stop at
nothing to get that promotion.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.829
Does she know
that you know me?

04:56.830 --> 04:59.732
No, I do not believe
your name came up.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.667
Okay, that's perfect.

05:01.668 --> 05:04.770
If she comes in here again,
find out everything you can.

05:04.771 --> 05:08.340
I'm gonna need you
to go deep undercover.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.543
Honestly, it would be my pleasure.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.714
Oh, sorry.

05:15.715 --> 05:19.918
- I'm looking for Dr. Shaw.
- Yes. Yes, I'm Dr. Shaw.

05:19.919 --> 05:23.589
Amy.
Amy... Dr. Amy Shaw.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.181
You can call me Amy
or doctor.

05:26.216 --> 05:28.077
Really, it's totally your choice.

05:29.198 --> 05:30.612
You're really
the team shrink?

05:30.647 --> 05:33.407
Yes. Yes, I am. Just started.

05:33.442 --> 05:34.266
Oh, but don't worry.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.436
I have tons of...
quite a bit of...

05:38.419 --> 05:39.706
Yes, I am.

05:41.908 --> 05:44.376
So do I just lay down?

05:44.377 --> 05:49.439
You can sit, lay, stand,
rock gently in the corner.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.219
Really just however
you're most comfortable.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:06.365 --> 06:08.266
I'm good.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.723
Okay.

06:11.388 --> 06:12.804
All right, so, Danny,

06:12.805 --> 06:14.272
I think the first
thing we need to do

06:14.273 --> 06:17.275
is figure out why you're
having so much trouble focusing.

06:17.276 --> 06:18.343
So...

06:18.344 --> 06:19.244
Who's the loud blonde

06:19.245 --> 06:20.812
that's always hanging
around the rink?

06:20.813 --> 06:22.948
Oh, that's my mom,
but if we could leave

06:22.949 --> 06:25.084
her out of this,
that would be great.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.386
I was actually talking
about the other one.

06:28.387 --> 06:31.623
- Girlfriend?
- You mean Riley.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.792
No, she's a...

06:34.193 --> 06:37.196
Well, she's...

06:39.999 --> 06:43.134
It's complicated.

06:43.135 --> 06:45.203
So why don't you
tell me about Riley?

06:45.204 --> 06:48.440
Can we maybe talk
about my mom instead?

06:48.441 --> 06:51.276
Not if you want to get better.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.144
Just relax and start
at the beginning.

06:53.145 --> 06:55.214
Now take a deep breath.

06:57.984 --> 07:00.419
Yeah, just collect
your thoughts.

07:04.156 --> 07:05.824
Danny?

07:14.033 --> 07:15.066
Ah, hey, Wheeler.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.902
Oh, Riley, hi.
What are you doing here?

07:18.971 --> 07:21.172
I'm dropping Emma off.

07:21.173 --> 07:23.141
I usually just, you know,
leave her on the curb,

07:23.142 --> 07:25.211
but she had some packages
she needed help with, so...

07:30.383 --> 07:31.449
I'm actually surprised

07:31.450 --> 07:33.018
you were willing
to take Emma today.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.185
With Fitch back in town,

07:34.186 --> 07:36.921
I figured you two would
be out celebrating.

07:36.922 --> 07:39.425
What is it with you
Wheeler boys?

07:40.693 --> 07:42.260
Honestly,

07:42.261 --> 07:45.797
I've been using her to help me
avoid having the talk with Fitch.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.432
It's pretty hard to have
a serious conversation

07:47.433 --> 07:50.169
when someone's teething,
so well done, Emma.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.138
Something wrong
with you and Fitch?

07:54.027 --> 07:57.208
No, it's just...
It's just a timing thing.

07:57.209 --> 07:59.811
Like, we're both on the
train to relationship-ville,

07:59.812 --> 08:02.714
but I'm on the local
and he's on the express.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.050
And one car's gonna get there
sooner than the other, right?

08:05.051 --> 08:07.453
I was never a really
big fan of word problems.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.394
Finally.

08:16.395 --> 08:19.231
I saw you come home
through the window.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.134
Did that therapist
turn you against me?

08:23.135 --> 08:25.103
Huh?

08:25.104 --> 08:28.106
It's because I gave you
that home perm, isn't it?

08:28.107 --> 08:30.108
What?

08:30.109 --> 08:32.845
No! And you said my hair
was naturally curly.

08:34.113 --> 08:37.148
Yeah, well, I'm here to tell you
it's a waste of time.

08:37.149 --> 08:40.019
I've been on a
shrink's couch before.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.155
- You were in therapy?
- No, we were dating.

08:47.393 --> 08:51.393
But it's the mother who
gets blamed for everything.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.298
What is that?
What are you writing?

08:53.299 --> 08:55.066
It's a feelings log.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.068
Dr. Shaw thinks
I should keep one.

08:58.357 --> 09:00.805
Can barely scribble
out a mother's day card,

09:00.806 --> 09:02.073
yet you have no problem

09:02.074 --> 09:04.442
telling a complete stranger
that I made you wear a dress

09:04.443 --> 09:06.112
- in the preschool pageant!
- Mom!

09:07.413 --> 09:11.049
Well, you were the perfect
Annie with that hair.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.150
Just...

09:12.151 --> 09:14.920
You're never fully
dressed without a smile.

09:18.023 --> 09:19.824
What is with all the yelling?

09:19.825 --> 09:21.960
I've got a second shift later.
I was trying to get some sleep.

09:21.961 --> 09:23.895
Well, I'm done talking.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.397
Is your jaw tired from running
your mother into the ground?

09:26.398 --> 09:29.100
It's because I forgot to
pick you up from space camp.

09:29.101 --> 09:31.302
- Isn't it?
- I never went to space camp.

09:31.303 --> 09:33.872
Oh, and I suppose you're
gonna blame me for that too!

09:34.616 --> 09:35.874
Oh my God.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.108
You guys are not
going to believe this.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.276
Ben was right.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.145
Oh, you're right.
I don't believe it.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.113
All right, so if Fitch calls,
I'm out with Emma.

09:42.114 --> 09:43.182
Bye, Emma.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.786
- What was I right about?
- Dude, everything.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.354
Thanks to your heads
up on the Jenna front

09:49.355 --> 09:54.058
you are looking at the new
associate producer of "Chase Live."

09:54.947 --> 09:56.861
That's amazing, dude.
Congratulations.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.330
They said it was
the best presentation

09:59.331 --> 10:00.965
they'd ever seen.

10:00.966 --> 10:03.168
Dude, the job is as good as mine.
I totally owe you.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.004
Well, I don't remember if
I actually told you or not,

10:06.005 --> 10:08.039
but Jenna gave me
her number.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.809
- So I was wondering...
- If you can go out with her?

10:10.810 --> 10:12.844
Yeah, that'd be cool, right?

10:12.845 --> 10:14.979
Not right. Not cool.

10:14.980 --> 10:17.081
Ben, the minute
I get my new desk,

10:17.082 --> 10:19.951
I'm gonna sit Jenna down
in front of it and fire her.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.986
Tucker, that's not right.

10:21.987 --> 10:23.856
I can't wait to see her
face when I tell her.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.092
Yeah, me neither.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.032
Is everything okay?

10:38.339 --> 10:40.340
I can't believe you talked
me into playing hooky.

10:40.341 --> 10:43.209
You're gonna get me into some
serious trouble, Ben Wheeler.

10:43.210 --> 10:46.212
- You have no idea.
- I really should go.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.214
Now?

10:48.215 --> 10:49.482
Maybe we can make
out a little more.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.317
Who wants to snuggle?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.619
Nice try,

10:52.620 --> 10:55.321
but I have a big
presentation in the morning.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.491
I'm fighting some stupid
toad for a promotion.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.093
Pfft.

11:00.094 --> 11:02.395
Who wants a job where you
have to fight to get ahead?

11:02.396 --> 11:04.486
Have you ever thought
about finding another one?

11:04.487 --> 11:06.698
- Well, it's not my dream job, so...
- It's not?

11:06.761 --> 11:08.996
Life is short. Shoot
for the stars...

11:09.264 --> 11:11.565
Or maybe a better paying
position across town.

11:11.566 --> 11:15.602
One thing I know about
you is that you are a woman

11:15.603 --> 11:17.671
who can do anything
she sets her mind to.

11:17.672 --> 11:18.906
We just met.

11:18.907 --> 11:20.908
That is how much
I believe in you.

11:20.909 --> 11:22.643
Thank you, Ben.

11:22.644 --> 11:25.012
You're turning out to be
a surprisingly sweet guy.

11:25.013 --> 11:26.650
Oh.

11:27.715 --> 11:29.017
I'm just getting started.

11:32.353 --> 11:35.289
Well, hey.
Just saw that you were

11:35.290 --> 11:37.624
sitting out here all alone.

11:37.625 --> 11:40.327
I saw you got
some new binoculars.

11:40.328 --> 11:42.563
What's that?

11:42.564 --> 11:44.698
Proof that your therapist

11:44.699 --> 11:47.501
shouldn't be blaming
me for your slump.

11:47.502 --> 11:51.271
Hey, look at all these
memories I made for you.

11:51.272 --> 11:53.707
You know,
all the birthday parties,

11:53.708 --> 11:55.776
the trips to the shore...

11:55.777 --> 11:57.544
Is that the dog you
made us give away?

11:57.545 --> 12:00.313
Okay, enough with the
trip down memory Lane.

12:01.716 --> 12:02.816
Okay, Danny...

12:02.817 --> 12:05.652
What do you keep
writing in thing anyway?

12:05.653 --> 12:07.588
I told you. It's private.

12:07.589 --> 12:09.389
Okay, Danny,

12:09.390 --> 12:13.390
I'm sorry I've been
overbearing and too involved.

12:13.761 --> 12:16.797
I may not be the
perfect mother, okay?

12:16.798 --> 12:20.300
But I have given you
kids my entire life.

12:20.301 --> 12:22.903
I woke up at 5:00 A.M.
every morning

12:22.904 --> 12:24.638
for your hockey practices.

12:24.639 --> 12:27.674
I've lugged your sweaty
equipment around for years!

12:27.675 --> 12:30.377
I have wrestled
hecklers to the ground

12:30.378 --> 12:32.913
and gotten coaches
transferred overseas!

12:32.914 --> 12:35.582
So for you to be
taking the advice

12:35.583 --> 12:38.852
of some know-nothing,
inexperienced, judgmental

12:38.853 --> 12:41.455
head doctor who is
brain washing you

12:41.456 --> 12:44.525
into thinking that all of
your issues are my fault,

12:44.526 --> 12:47.561
well, Danny Wheeler, you
have got another thing coming.

12:48.660 --> 12:50.597
My issues are all about Riley.

12:50.598 --> 12:52.667
Sounds like she knows
what she's talking about.

12:54.903 --> 12:57.638
Riley: Oh, hi.
Excuse me.

12:57.639 --> 12:58.872
Do you know where
Danny Wheeler is?

12:58.873 --> 13:01.808
Oh, I think the team is just
taking some publicity photos.

13:01.809 --> 13:03.844
They should be back
in a few minutes.

13:03.845 --> 13:05.546
Riley, right?

13:05.547 --> 13:08.382
Um, yeah.

13:08.383 --> 13:09.650
How do you know that
my name is Riley?

13:09.651 --> 13:10.751
Dr. Shaw.

13:10.752 --> 13:13.020
Amy...
Dr. Amy Shaw.

13:13.021 --> 13:16.456
I'm still working on
the whole name thing.

13:16.457 --> 13:19.526
- You're Danny's shrink?
- Psychologist.

13:19.527 --> 13:22.835
Oh, I'm a lawyer.

13:23.495 --> 13:24.843
Almost.

13:26.334 --> 13:28.235
I'm sure people do this
to you all the time,

13:28.236 --> 13:30.671
but I'm kind of going through
this thing with this guy.

13:30.672 --> 13:32.606
I'm sorry, I really can't
tell you what Danny says

13:32.607 --> 13:33.440
about you in our sessions.

13:33.441 --> 13:35.442
Oh, no, that's not...

13:35.443 --> 13:37.477
Wait, he talks about me
in therapy?

13:37.478 --> 13:39.887
No, who said that?

13:41.941 --> 13:43.450
Uh, you just did.

13:43.451 --> 13:46.353
Honestly, he has never
even mentioned you.

13:46.354 --> 13:48.622
Oh, Danny.
Oh, here he is.

13:48.623 --> 13:49.990
There you are. This friend,

13:49.991 --> 13:51.458
who I've never
heard anything about,

13:51.459 --> 13:52.860
was just asking about you.

13:54.262 --> 13:55.929
Ladies, what's going on?

13:55.930 --> 13:57.966
- Oh, nothing.
- Nothing, nothing. No.

13:59.834 --> 14:02.769
I just came by to wish
you good luck tonight.

14:02.770 --> 14:05.739
So... good luck.

14:05.740 --> 14:08.308
Fitch and I will be cheering
for you from the stands.

14:08.309 --> 14:10.344
Thanks. I can use all
the support I can get.

14:10.345 --> 14:13.581
- Doctor.
- Lawyer.

14:18.453 --> 14:22.453
Jenna, hi!
How's it going?

14:22.557 --> 14:24.358
Still gainfully employed?

14:24.359 --> 14:27.427
Better. You are looking at
the new associate producer

14:27.428 --> 14:29.596
of "Chase Live!"
I got the job.

14:29.597 --> 14:32.432
Wait, that job? The job?

14:32.433 --> 14:34.534
After your little
pep talk yesterday,

14:34.535 --> 14:36.637
I pulled out all the
stops and I got it.

14:36.638 --> 14:40.362
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:41.522 --> 14:42.972
Are you okay?

14:43.007 --> 14:44.511
Yeah. I'm fine.

14:44.512 --> 14:45.946
I just sometimes express
great joy

14:45.947 --> 14:47.682
by stuttering and
sweating profusely.

14:48.916 --> 14:50.984
What happened to the other
guy who was up for the job?

14:50.985 --> 14:52.619
I'll tell you what's
going to happen.

14:52.620 --> 14:55.956
First thing tomorrow morning,
I am firing him.

14:55.957 --> 14:58.458
My name didn't happen
to come up did it?

14:58.459 --> 14:59.926
Why would it?
Oh, but I wish

14:59.927 --> 15:01.495
you could have seen the
look on this guy's face

15:01.496 --> 15:03.865
when I got the job.
It was priceless.

15:09.337 --> 15:12.407
Yeah, I can picture it now.

15:19.683 --> 15:21.016
Come on, man.

15:21.017 --> 15:23.185
I am so so sorry. Okay?

15:23.186 --> 15:24.920
Sorry for what?

15:24.921 --> 15:27.989
Sorry for hooking up with Jenna
even after I forbid you?

15:27.990 --> 15:31.359
Technically the hooking
came before the forbidding.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.162
Ben, you helped her
steal my promotion.

15:34.163 --> 15:36.932
- She's gonna fire me.
- Tucker, please.

15:36.933 --> 15:38.900
I'll figure something out.
I promise.

15:38.901 --> 15:41.029
I'm in the shower.
I can't hear you.

15:42.038 --> 15:44.372
What is going on
with all the slamming?

15:44.373 --> 15:47.242
Tucker and I are having
a slight misunderstanding.

15:47.243 --> 15:49.278
This is not a slight
misunderstanding.

15:51.614 --> 15:53.566
You ladies look busy.

15:53.916 --> 15:56.618
All right, wish me luck.

15:56.619 --> 15:58.887
I got you guys seats next
to the bigwigs tonight.

15:58.888 --> 16:01.123
So, if I start stinking
up the ice again,

16:01.124 --> 16:02.290
you can put
in a good word for me.

16:03.631 --> 16:05.761
Hey, don't worry, man.
You're gonna do great tonight.

16:05.762 --> 16:07.741
And I will definitely be there...

16:08.731 --> 16:11.983
- Cheering you on.
- Thanks, man.

16:12.268 --> 16:14.603
Tucker, I'm gonna make
this right.

16:14.604 --> 16:16.317
I have a plan.

16:16.639 --> 16:19.875
Hey, Jenna, it's Ben.
You busy tonight?

16:19.876 --> 16:21.109
Seriously?!

16:21.110 --> 16:23.245
Your plan actually involves
you still going out with Jenna?

16:23.246 --> 16:25.143
What is wrong with you?!

16:25.882 --> 16:27.781
Let me call you right back.

16:28.751 --> 16:30.819
Let go of me.
Of course I'm on the list.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.021
What is wrong with
everyone tonight?

16:33.022 --> 16:34.823
First you make me take
a cab all the way uptown

16:34.824 --> 16:36.058
and my tickets
aren't at will call.

16:36.059 --> 16:37.659
Fitch and Emma
are waiting outside,

16:37.660 --> 16:39.227
and now I'm not on the list?

16:39.228 --> 16:40.595
I'm always on the list.

16:40.596 --> 16:43.699
Maybe this is just
a bad dream you're having.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.701
Maybe I should just take you home
and then I can wake you up.

16:46.702 --> 16:48.570
Just...

16:50.006 --> 16:52.007
Hey! Hey, Dr. Lady.

16:52.008 --> 16:53.675
Did you have something
to do with this?

16:53.676 --> 16:55.043
No I... I... I...

16:55.044 --> 16:56.078
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

16:56.079 --> 16:59.181
Oh, you must be
the shrink-a-dink.

16:59.182 --> 17:00.048
Hi.

17:00.049 --> 17:01.850
Bonnie Wheeler.
I just want to tell you,

17:01.851 --> 17:05.153
- you are doing a great job.
- He is a work in progress.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.688
And you know, maybe things
would be better for him

17:06.689 --> 17:09.090
if we all just cleared out
and really let him focus.

17:09.092 --> 17:10.925
It is only the second period.

17:10.926 --> 17:12.160
I'm not going anywhere
until someone tells me

17:12.161 --> 17:13.162
what's going on.

17:15.131 --> 17:17.566
Well, if you're not
gonna tell her, I will.

17:17.567 --> 17:20.781
Mrs. Wheeler, I really don't think
we should be talking about this.

17:21.604 --> 17:24.873
- Talking about what?
- Riley, believe me.

17:24.874 --> 17:28.076
I get no pleasure
in telling you this,

17:28.077 --> 17:31.147
but I'm not the problem.

17:32.648 --> 17:34.016
You are.

17:35.918 --> 17:37.720
Okay, maybe a little pleasure.

17:39.956 --> 17:42.057
Is this true?

17:42.058 --> 17:43.625
Am I the problem?

17:43.626 --> 17:45.060
Look out!

17:45.061 --> 17:48.029
- Coming through.
- Oh my God, what happened?

17:48.030 --> 17:50.800
Jenna got hit in the head
by one of Danny's wild shots.

17:51.934 --> 17:53.702
We were just sitting
there and bam!

17:53.703 --> 17:55.170
Nachos flying everywhere.

17:56.402 --> 17:58.006
Oh, that poor girl.

17:58.007 --> 18:00.008
Nachos here are 20 bucks.

18:01.131 --> 18:03.278
Really, Ben?
This was your plan?

18:03.279 --> 18:05.748
To literally knock out
my competition?

18:07.016 --> 18:10.118
This is the most disgusting,
underhanded thing you've ever done.

18:10.119 --> 18:11.920
Though I do appreciate
your effort.

18:11.921 --> 18:14.156
Tucker, come on.
I only brought Jenna

18:14.157 --> 18:16.124
because Danny sat us
with the big shots.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.792
I figured with both
of us working them,

18:17.793 --> 18:19.961
we could get her an amazing
job with the rangers,

18:19.962 --> 18:21.296
which I think we did.

18:21.297 --> 18:23.098
She has an interview
tomorrow morning.

18:23.099 --> 18:26.034
Oh, okay. Wow!

18:26.035 --> 18:27.769
That's... that's great.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.171
Just one little question.

18:29.172 --> 18:31.039
Why the hell wouldn't
you try to get me

18:31.040 --> 18:33.278
an amazing job
with the rangers?

18:33.776 --> 18:35.076
Oh, yeah.

18:35.077 --> 18:36.312
That might have worked too.

18:39.849 --> 18:41.149
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:41.150 --> 18:43.084
What are you doing here?
Figured you'd be with Fitch.

18:43.085 --> 18:45.253
Oh, no, he had to catch
an early flight.

18:45.254 --> 18:48.123
So discussion's to be
continued, as they say.

18:48.124 --> 18:50.258
Well, I wish you could
have stayed.

18:50.259 --> 18:53.695
Game winning goal,
thank me very much.

18:53.696 --> 18:55.897
That's great.

18:55.898 --> 18:57.899
Looks like
the old Danny is back.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.036
More like new and improved.

19:02.638 --> 19:04.068
You okay?

19:04.941 --> 19:06.007
Um...

19:07.101 --> 19:09.066
I think we need to talk.

19:09.101 --> 19:11.012
I feel like things

19:11.013 --> 19:13.114
have been a little
weird between us lately.

19:13.115 --> 19:15.817
And you're my best friend.

19:15.818 --> 19:19.386
- I can't have that.
- I don't want that either.

19:19.989 --> 19:23.191
Riley, it's honestly
not about you. It's me.

19:23.192 --> 19:25.627
It's just something that
I've had to work through.

19:25.628 --> 19:27.229
Are you?

19:28.228 --> 19:30.832
Yeah, I am.

19:30.833 --> 19:33.868
The problem isn't in my head.
It's in my heart.

19:33.869 --> 19:36.402
I just keep too many
things bottled up.

19:37.212 --> 19:39.975
Amy thinks it's because
I'm afraid of the consequences.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.844
But not anymore.

19:42.845 --> 19:44.012
That's all in the past.

19:44.013 --> 19:45.914
And from now on, if I see
something or someone I want

19:45.915 --> 19:48.917
just sitting there in front of me,
I'm gonna go for it.

19:48.918 --> 19:51.920
Oh, um, okay.

19:51.921 --> 19:54.823
That's not really where I
saw this conversation going.

19:54.824 --> 19:56.476
So I fired her
and asked her out.

19:58.194 --> 19:59.294
I'm sorry, wait.

19:59.295 --> 20:01.596
You fired who
and asked her what?

20:01.597 --> 20:03.798
Amy. Dr. Shaw.

20:03.799 --> 20:05.619
We're still working
on the name thing.

20:06.569 --> 20:09.537
This is really not where I saw
this conversation going.

20:09.538 --> 20:11.940
Um...

20:11.941 --> 20:13.942
D-did she say yes?

20:13.943 --> 20:17.946
- She most certainly did.
- That's great.

20:17.947 --> 20:20.081
That's great, Danny.
I'm really happy for you.

20:20.082 --> 20:22.284
If you ever need someone
to talk to about Fitch,

20:22.285 --> 20:23.986
she's pretty awesome.

20:25.988 --> 20:27.803
Maybe I'll do that.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.212
- Cheers.
- To what?

20:31.894 --> 20:33.681
To new beginnings.

20:33.816 --> 20:34.997
To new beginnings.

20:40.872 --> 20:44.247
It's just... my mother
never listens to me.

20:44.282 --> 20:46.423
You know, always
squashing my dreams,

20:46.458 --> 20:48.383
putting her needs before mine,

20:48.418 --> 20:51.184
inserting herself
into my business.

20:51.219 --> 20:54.762
I mean, seriously, this
woman has no boundaries.

20:55.962 --> 20:59.680
I mean, to be honest I think
she's a little narcissistic.

21:01.465 --> 21:04.594
I mean, completely unaware
that she's intruding

21:04.629 --> 21:07.051
and invading my privacy.

21:07.086 --> 21:10.417
Mom, we are trying
to eat over here.

21:10.452 --> 21:13.016
Okay, just let me tell
you one quick story

21:13.051 --> 21:14.656
about my gram-gram.
