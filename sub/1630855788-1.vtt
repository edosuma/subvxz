00:32.448 --> 00:33.909
You got your keys, right?

00:34.409 --> 00:36.328
Yeah. Yeah, got them.

00:47.798 --> 00:48.799
Hey.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.718
There you are.
Thought you might be asleep for a second.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.221
<i>Nope. Still up, as always.</i>

00:54.221 --> 00:55.597
How's the sleep app working?

00:55.597 --> 00:58.392
Well, I tried it again the other night.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.395
The fella's meant to talk you
to sleep, right? But his voice is so sexy,

01:01.395 --> 01:04.230
I started fantasizing about him
rescuing me from a burning oil rig.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.693
Which, you know, is great
but useless if you're an insomniac.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.236
<i>Have you ever tried them?</i>

01:09.236 --> 01:10.737
No.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.240
Hypnotism, acupuncture, none of it works.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.575
<i>I bought a book online</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:18.161
<i>called</i> One Thousand and One Sleep
Cures and Remedies. <i>Rubbish.</i>

01:18.161 --> 01:21.790
It's full of crap.
Like, wear a hat full of lavender.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.792
<i>Listen to a recording
of someone else sleeping.</i>

01:23.792 --> 01:26.086
<i>Only inhale through one nostril.</i>

01:26.086 --> 01:28.922
Sleep on a soft mattress.
Sleep on a hard mattress.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.009
Get the soft mattress
on top of the hard mattress.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.302
Then sleep on them both.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.971
<i>Pray to a Norse god. Ignore your eyes.</i>

01:35.971 --> 01:36.889
<i>No. All right, look,</i>

01:36.889 --> 01:38.765
<i>I may have made a couple of those up,
but, you know.</i>

01:38.765 --> 01:40.767
Sorry, I didn't listen to a word
you just said.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.436
Danny, why are you crawling around
in the dark?

01:43.020 --> 01:45.564
- You know my neighbor?
- What, the pussy person?

01:46.982 --> 01:48.317
- The Cat Man.
- You like that?

01:48.317 --> 01:51.069
For some unfathomable reason,
he invited me to his cat's birthday party.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.571
How old is it?

01:52.571 --> 01:55.115
It's 17. We all chipped in
and got it driving lessons.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.119
<i>Anyway,</i>

01:59.119 --> 02:01.413
<i>I had to come up with an excuse
for why I couldn't attend,</i>

02:01.413 --> 02:04.333
and in hindsight,
I went a little bit overboard.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.334
Why? What'd you tell him?

02:05.334 --> 02:08.544
I was going on a month-long sabbatical
staying at every Disneyland in the world.

02:08.544 --> 02:11.632
- Why did you tell him that?
- Never been. Always wanted to.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.258
I thought now would be a good time to go.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.718
<i>But you never even go out.</i>

02:14.718 --> 02:16.261
Yeah, I know. There are flaws to my logic.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.679
<i>And now he thinks I'm away.</i>

02:17.679 --> 02:20.349
<i>He's having the party on my patio.
It's been going on for hours.</i>

02:20.349 --> 02:22.059
<i>Right, so is that your plan
for the next month?</i>

02:22.059 --> 02:24.728
Every time he's outside, you're just
gonna crawl around in the dark?

02:24.728 --> 02:26.730
Yeah. I'm committed now.

02:26.730 --> 02:30.067
And, on the bright side, think
of all the money I'll save on light bulbs.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.110
Why don't you just pull the curtains?

02:32.110 --> 02:33.403
I don't have any.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.323
And if I get some and I put them up
and he sees them, he'll think,

02:36.323 --> 02:38.450
"Where did those curtains come from?"
And he'll know I'm in.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.910
<i>So it's like a catch-22.</i>

02:40.953 --> 02:41.954
Just a thought.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.331
<i>What are you gonna do about food?</i>

02:45.791 --> 02:47.876
Or is Adam across the hall
still doing your shopping for you?

02:47.876 --> 02:49.628
No, I had to make him believe
I'm in Disneyland too.

02:49.628 --> 02:50.963
<i>You know what he's like.</i>

02:50.963 --> 02:53.757
If he knew the truth, he'd spill the beans
to the whole building in 30 seconds.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.133
- Yeah.
- <i>Look, it's fine.</i>

02:55.133 --> 02:59.137
I feel fine. I feel good. I'm just gonna
live off what's in the flat, which is...

03:02.558 --> 03:04.810
a jar of mayonnaise
and a variety pack of Frosties.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.273
Yeah, I didn't think this through
properly, did I?

03:09.273 --> 03:11.608
This is one of those times
where being able to go outside

03:11.608 --> 03:13.569
- might be quite useful.
- <i>Would it? Thank you.</i>

03:13.569 --> 03:16.613
Well, I can't help it. And now I'm hungry.
I'm gonna have to order a pizza.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.574
Cat Man, deliveries.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.784
<i>Hiding from someone is so complicated.</i>

03:20.784 --> 03:21.743
<i>I'm gonna risk it.</i>

03:21.743 --> 03:22.953
<i>I'll use it as a dummy run,
see if it's possible.</i>

03:22.953 --> 03:24.621
Cat Man can't stay out there forever.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.166
Right. One anchovy and pineapple.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.960
<i>Anchovy and pineapple?</i>

03:29.960 --> 03:31.962
Absolutely. On the way. Where are you?

03:32.546 --> 03:33.505
<i>Late-night chemist.</i>

03:33.505 --> 03:34.798
Poppy's chicken pox.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.009
She is still scratching herself
like a little baboon,

03:37.009 --> 03:38.093
and we've run out of Peridyne.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.596
<i>And on top of that, most of her class
has now come down with it.</i>

03:40.596 --> 03:44.516
Parents' WhatsApp has been going nuts
all week. I feel terrible.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.934
Why do you feel terrible?

03:46.476 --> 03:47.561
<i>Remember how I said</i>

03:47.561 --> 03:49.313
<i>I didn't take Poppy on the school trip</i>

03:49.313 --> 03:51.565
- <i>because of her chicken pox?</i>
- What's wrong, Mummy?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.025
Nothing's wrong.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.693
- Yeah, we'll be going in a minute.
- Mummy!

03:54.693 --> 03:56.195
I've just gotta make something first.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.198
<i>Well, I kind of did.</i>

04:00.115 --> 04:02.367
There. Now you really look like a sheep.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.869
- Baa!
- Baa.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.288
<i>There was no way I was gonna bail.</i>

04:06.288 --> 04:09.082
<i>What, and let Zach's bitchy mum
get one over on me again?</i>

04:10.876 --> 04:12.127
Everything okay there?

04:12.961 --> 04:13.962
Yeah, fine.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.005
It's just how we do it at home.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.259
We had lasagna last night. Total chaos.

04:20.219 --> 04:23.722
<i>I could tell she was getting suspicious,
but I totally got away with it.</i>

04:25.974 --> 04:28.644
Crafty.
And, you know, morally questionable.

04:29.186 --> 04:33.482
<i>Don't you start. I saw this ad
for some new pills called Snoozers.</i>

04:33.482 --> 04:35.275
Extra strength for proper insomniacs.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.902
I should see if I can get some in here.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.529
No, don't. They don't knock you out.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.155
They just make everything taste
like cabbage.

04:40.155 --> 04:43.408
<i>Apart from cabbage, which, you know,
already has that slightly cabbage-y taste.</i>

04:43.408 --> 04:44.952
But you know what I'm gonna say,
don't you?

04:44.952 --> 04:47.412
No. Can we please go one night
without having this conversation?

04:47.412 --> 04:49.122
I'm not going with you to a sleep clinic.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.249
Go on.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.584
No. People with clipboards
watching me kip?

04:52.584 --> 04:54.419
<i>When I sleep, I don't like an audience.</i>

04:54.419 --> 04:57.548
<i>Also, what if, you know--</i>

04:57.548 --> 04:59.132
What if when I'm snoozing...

05:00.467 --> 05:01.802
I touch myself?

05:02.803 --> 05:04.930
I mean, do you touch yourself
when you sleep?

05:04.930 --> 05:07.266
<i>I don't know, but judging
by how much I do when I'm awake,</i>

05:07.266 --> 05:08.642
<i>I wouldn't be ruling it out.</i>

05:09.351 --> 05:12.145
<i>Anyway, wouldn't, you know, Veggie mind
you spending the night with me?</i>

05:12.145 --> 05:14.815
<i>I doubt it. He just thinks of you
as one of the girls. You know,</i>

05:14.815 --> 05:16.358
basically a lady.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.820
Does he? Well, that's nice to know.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.655
Hang on. Veggie's calling.
I'll call you back.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.575
<i>Hi, Veg.</i>

05:24.575 --> 05:26.410
Panic over. She is asleep,

05:26.410 --> 05:28.328
and I am the best stepdad ever.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.538
<i>How did you manage that?</i>

05:29.538 --> 05:30.664
I just read to her.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.082
Well, I tried that. What'd you read?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.210
Well, you know,
just <i>The History of Bricks.</i>

05:35.210 --> 05:36.170
Sorry, what?

05:36.753 --> 05:38.547
<i>The History of Bricks.</i>

05:39.298 --> 05:41.425
- Why are you reading that now?
- For Saturday.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.844
- Yeah, the brick thing.
- <i>Yeah, you know me.</i>

05:43.844 --> 05:45.137
<i>Preparation is everything.</i>

05:45.137 --> 05:46.889
Plus, it's actually really interesting.

05:46.889 --> 05:50.184
<i>Currently learning about the brick
Gothic period of the 12th century.</i>

05:50.184 --> 05:51.685
All right. Well, as long as you're happy.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.103
Please don't leave me.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.354
<i>Did you get the itchy medicine?</i>

05:54.354 --> 05:56.148
No. I'm waiting for the pharmacist.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.525
That's fine.
I still have seven more chapters to go.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.277
All right. Well, let me know how it ends.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.487
Well, I don't think
there's really a story as such--

06:03.322 --> 06:04.406
You were joking, weren't you?

06:04.406 --> 06:06.950
Little bit, yeah. Do you want me
to bring you something home?

06:06.950 --> 06:08.744
You could always surprise me.

06:08.744 --> 06:11.371
Okay. Challenge accepted.
I'll text you when I'm on my way home.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.332
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- <i>All right, bye!</i>

06:15.292 --> 06:16.919
Okay, where were we?

06:18.921 --> 06:19.922
<i>All good?</i>

06:19.922 --> 06:22.591
Yeah, it's all fine.
Knee supports. Perfect.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.051
- I'll get him one of these.
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

06:24.051 --> 06:26.970
- He's doing a brick-athlon on the weekend.
- What's a brick-athlon?

06:26.970 --> 06:29.348
It's like a triathlon.
You run, swim and cycle.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.308
But at the end,
you have to build a small wall.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.267
Impressive.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.769
<i>Have you been served yet?</i>

06:33.769 --> 06:37.147
No. There's no one behind the counter.
Must be out the back.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.358
Well, do yourself a favor.
Get their attention. Shout.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.068
<i>No. I hate that. It's rude.</i>

06:43.195 --> 06:44.655
- What?
- Shut up.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.698
You shut up. I didn't say anything.
What are you doing?

06:47.282 --> 06:48.367
It's Zach's mum.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.338
- Lisa. Hi.
- Kate. Oh, my God. This is so weird.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.842
- Were you hiding from me?
- Hiding? God, no.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.927
<i>No, why would I-- Why would you-- No.</i>

07:06.927 --> 07:08.554
Definitely wasn't hiding, no.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.722
Zach has chicken pox.

07:10.722 --> 07:11.890
Oh, no.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.434
How's Poppy, by the way?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.520
She didn't wanna take that mask off,
did she?

07:16.520 --> 07:21.358
No. She wanted her portrayal of the sheep
to be as accurate as possible.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.985
She's so method these days.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.406
So I take it that bottle
of calamine lotion you're holding

07:27.406 --> 07:28.574
is for something else?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.789
Yeah, it is. Absolutely.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.753
- Well, I should be getting back.
- Okay.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.130
Where's the pharmacist?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.673
I don't know. I've just been waiting here.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.341
- Well, have you shouted?
- That's a good idea.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.177
- No, I didn't wanna--
- Hello?

07:48.886 --> 07:49.970
Hello?

07:51.638 --> 07:55.434
Well, looks like
we'll just have to wait it out.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.227
Together.

08:03.192 --> 08:06.486
- Maybe I can buy this for you?
- Why would you offer to do that?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.489
Well, I just think us mums should stick
together. You can get the next round.

08:12.743 --> 08:16.163
Okay. Well, thanks.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.373
Yeah.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.880
<i>Sorry, can I talk now?</i>

08:26.256 --> 08:27.591
I have got to get out of here.

08:27.591 --> 08:31.011
<i>I cannot run into any more parents
of children I might have infected.</i>

08:32.971 --> 08:35.307
Hello? Mr. Pharmacist?

08:36.975 --> 08:38.268
Mrs. Pharmacist?

08:38.769 --> 08:40.395
- <i>Anyone?</i>
- Well, how about this?

08:40.395 --> 08:41.772
Take the lotion and leave the money.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.649
I can't do that. I've only got a card.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.150
Well, do you know
how to use a card machine?

08:46.485 --> 08:49.279
<i>I do actually.
But that just feels all wrong.</i>

08:50.614 --> 08:51.740
- Okay, fine.
- <i>Do it.</i>

08:52.282 --> 08:53.283
Fine.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.708
- Shit. No. Shit.
- <i>What?</i>

09:01.708 --> 09:03.252
- What?
- Oh, God, no.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.254
- I just charged myself a hundred quid.
- <i>What?</i>

09:05.254 --> 09:07.172
Okay, and if I did this?

09:07.172 --> 09:10.092
- Come on then. No!
- <i>What?</i>

09:10.092 --> 09:11.677
Just charged myself another hundred quid.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.554
This guy's profits
are gonna go through the roof.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.347
Now I have to stay here
to wait for a refund.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.849
Danny, this is all your fault.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.100
Come on.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.689
14.99 for Vagisette?

09:23.689 --> 09:25.482
<i>That is daylight robbery.</i>

09:25.983 --> 09:27.901
What is Vagisette?
It sounds like a kind of glue.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.779
So why would a woman need
a kind of glue for down there, Danny?

09:30.779 --> 09:33.198
I don't know. In case something snaps off.
A nubbin or something.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.409
A nubbin?

09:36.618 --> 09:40.163
Okay, my memory of the female anatomy
is a touch cloudy. Thank you.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.416
- So you're not seeing anyone then, yeah?
- Course not.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.084
The closest I've come
in God knows how long

09:44.084 --> 09:47.129
to having intimate contact
with another living being was yesterday,

09:47.129 --> 09:48.797
when I ate a pork scratching.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.133
You do have to leave the flat
if you actually want to meet someone.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.218
Yeah, well, you know,
Chloe was hard to get over.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.930
<i>Well, she was three years ago.</i>

09:56.930 --> 09:58.432
What's the longest you've been single for?

10:00.017 --> 10:03.020
I would say five-and-a-half weeks.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.314
Congratulations. What can I say?
I'm pathetic.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.149
- I'm not judging you.
- Yes, you are.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.026
Yeah, I am a little bit.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.361
<i>You know what?</i>

10:11.361 --> 10:13.989
I am gonna sign you up
for this dating app.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.240
Very good.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.909
<i>That's not happening at all.
Not on my watch.</i>

10:16.909 --> 10:17.868
- It is.
- <i>Nope.</i>

10:18.785 --> 10:19.786
Hang on.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.503
Here we go. Pizza's here.

10:32.799 --> 10:33.842
Oh, yes.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.726
Hey. Just come in and leave the pizza
by Flat 8. I'll buzz you in.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.978
<i>I'm not allowed to come inside.
You have to come out.</i>

10:44.978 --> 10:46.605
What do you mean?
You guys always come inside.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.066
The rule's changed. You need
to come outside so I can take a picture.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.318
- Why do you need to take a picture?
- To prove I've delivered the pizza.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.112
Do I have to be eating it, holding
a copy of today's newspaper as well?

10:54.112 --> 10:55.280
<i>Look, mate, please.</i>

10:55.280 --> 10:57.824
- It's only my second day.
- Can I help you?

10:58.408 --> 10:59.493
Shit.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.287
I'm just delivering a pizza to Flat 8.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.414
You must have the wrong address.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.376
The gentleman living in Flat 8
has gone to Disneyland.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.710
But I was just talking to him.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.467
See? Disneyland.

11:23.934 --> 11:24.935
Adam Fothergill.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.729
Hi.
I don't suppose you've ordered a pizza?

11:27.729 --> 11:31.191
No, I never order takeaways.
Too many junk calories. What kind is it?

11:32.401 --> 11:36.947
Anchovy and pineapple.
That is a Danny special.

11:36.947 --> 11:38.240
But Danny's in Disneyland.

11:38.824 --> 11:39.825
Right.

11:39.825 --> 11:40.909
Happy to help, mate.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.413
Disneyland?

11:49.001 --> 11:52.337
- Hi.
- Hello. Can I ask you a question?

11:52.337 --> 11:53.338
Sure.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.591
Are you in Disneyland?

11:56.175 --> 11:57.176
Not right now, no.

11:57.176 --> 11:58.427
I didn't think you was.

11:58.427 --> 11:59.970
You're coming out to get your pizza, yeah?

12:01.513 --> 12:04.600
Yeah. I'll be right there.

12:52.648 --> 12:54.316
Why are you still here?

12:54.316 --> 12:58.654
The bloke from Flat 8, he's here.
He's not at Disneyland. Look.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.615
Hello?

13:03.450 --> 13:04.451
<i>Hello?</i>

13:07.329 --> 13:10.374
<i>Hello? Mate?</i>

13:14.211 --> 13:15.212
Do you want this?

13:15.963 --> 13:17.047
Thank you.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.927
It's my cat's birthday party,
if you're interested.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.012
I've made a flan.

13:24.012 --> 13:28.058
I would, but, work.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.519
Suit yourself.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.146
Come on, Angela.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.861
I was so close.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.530
What's your date of birth?
The third of the ninth, isn't it?

13:41.530 --> 13:43.657
Yeah. Why? What are you doing?

13:43.657 --> 13:45.325
I told you.
I'm setting up your dating profile.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.035
No, you're not. No. Don't.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.496
I thought you were joking. Haven't you
got to buy drugs for an itchy kid?

13:49.496 --> 13:52.749
Look, I'm sure the chemist won't be long,
and until then, we're gonna do this.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.334
I don't want to. Why are you making me?

13:54.334 --> 13:57.004
<i>Because, Daniel, you're my friend
and I don't want you to die alone.</i>

13:57.004 --> 13:59.464
Trust me, this site is great.
Me and Veggie met on it.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.508
He was the first person
I rated compatible with.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.135
How compatible?

14:04.094 --> 14:05.596
<i>Well, the percentage isn't important,
is it?</i>

14:05.596 --> 14:07.973
No, go on. How compatible?

14:09.850 --> 14:11.602
Fifty-two percent.

14:11.602 --> 14:13.854
I reckon I'd be 52% compatible
with Veggie.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.814
Name. Daniel Gibson.

14:15.814 --> 14:16.899
<i>Occupation?</i>

14:16.899 --> 14:18.233
What is your occupation?

14:19.151 --> 14:20.777
Internet person? Journalist.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.613
That's right.
Do you wanna know what hard-hitting,

14:22.613 --> 14:24.323
Pulitzer Prize-winning stories
I'm working on?

14:25.240 --> 14:27.326
"Twelve Ways to Know
Your Dog's Depressed"

14:28.076 --> 14:30.120
and "Ten Things They Haven't Told You
about Vinegar."

14:31.163 --> 14:33.832
- What haven't they told us?
- I don't know. I haven't made them up yet.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.130
Okay. First question.
"Do you desire sexual activity?"

14:40.130 --> 14:41.381
Yeah, a little bit.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.383
You know, if they're--
It's like-- It's an offer.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.718
I imagine you do after three years.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.220
<i>Okay.</i>

14:46.220 --> 14:48.680
"How important
is your partner's physical appearance?

14:48.680 --> 14:52.476
Not at all important, somewhat important,
very important?"

14:52.476 --> 14:53.644
Not important at all.

14:53.644 --> 14:56.313
<i>Not important. No. Not at all.</i>

14:58.148 --> 15:00.651
Maybe a tiny bit. It's probably
a little bit more important than that.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.653
Maybe a sliver a bit more important
than I just said.

15:02.653 --> 15:04.321
<i>Really depends,
the way you look at it, 'cause--</i>

15:04.321 --> 15:05.989
- Shall I just put very important?
- Yes, please.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.658
<i>Okay. Next.</i>

15:07.658 --> 15:11.495
"Do you have any hidden talents?"
I'll just put a no there.

15:11.495 --> 15:13.705
- Don't put a no there. Put a yes there...
- <i>Have you?</i>

15:13.705 --> 15:14.873
...and make it bold,

15:14.873 --> 15:16.041
because I do have talents.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.293
- Do you? Like what?
- I can play the keyboard.

15:18.293 --> 15:19.545
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

15:19.545 --> 15:23.465
Don't laugh. I can. Don't laugh,
'cause I can. Yeah, I was in a band.

15:23.465 --> 15:24.550
Stop it.

15:24.550 --> 15:25.634
The Cuties.

15:26.969 --> 15:30.013
What were we? We were kind of
Radiohead meets the Backstreet Boys.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.016
<i>I was quite flamboyant actually.</i>

15:33.016 --> 15:34.977
<i>I performed with a candelabra
over the head.</i>

15:38.814 --> 15:40.607
So how come you didn't become
a rock god then?

15:40.607 --> 15:42.734
All fell apart.
Broke up after a couple months.

15:42.734 --> 15:43.819
Why?

15:43.819 --> 15:45.529
I set fire to the drummer.

15:45.529 --> 15:48.574
Wait, wait, wait. Jeff!

15:48.574 --> 15:49.867
I'm sorry!

15:54.997 --> 15:56.415
How's the Cat Man situation?

15:56.415 --> 15:57.499
He's still out there.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.294
You know you're supposed to be
sharing that with Dame Judy.

16:00.294 --> 16:02.129
I think he's feeding my pizza to the cats.

16:02.754 --> 16:06.175
You wanna go over there? Okay.

16:06.175 --> 16:08.594
- Now.
- <i>What are you doing now?</i>

16:08.594 --> 16:10.971
Well, I ordered another pizza
about 20 minutes ago.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.556
What? You ordered another one?

16:12.556 --> 16:15.225
Yeah. I've been watching,
and around every half hour or so,

16:15.225 --> 16:16.935
Cat Man does a circuit of the building.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.646
Takes him approximately four
and a half minutes to return.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.065
That's four and a half
Cat Man-free minutes.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.194
Also, it took 28 minutes
for the first pizza to be delivered.

16:25.194 --> 16:28.614
I've timed the last order to coincide
with Cat Man's latest wander.

16:28.614 --> 16:30.532
If my calculations are correct...

16:33.118 --> 16:34.203
Very good.

16:34.203 --> 16:35.287
How about that?

16:41.335 --> 16:44.087
Hey. Go to the last window
on the left-hand side of the building.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.298
You're not gonna muck me about again,
are you?

16:46.298 --> 16:47.799
No. It's all good. Trust me.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.773
No. Shit. Not again.

17:06.484 --> 17:10.696
Hey. Here.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.532
Don't work, but we'll pass it through.
Come on.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.747
- Wait.
- It'll fit. Come on.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.669
It's not gonna fit.

17:25.337 --> 17:27.548
Okay. We have two minutes
until the man with the cat comes back.

17:27.548 --> 17:29.174
You're gonna have to slide it through,
slice by slice.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.718
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

17:31.718 --> 17:35.389
I mean, this is getting kind of weird.
This isn't like a fetish, is it?

17:35.389 --> 17:38.350
No. I'm hungry. It'll only take a minute.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.854
I'll give you a 20 quid tip.

17:43.272 --> 17:46.275
- Okay. Money first.
- Yeah. Money first.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.153
So...

17:56.243 --> 17:57.160
Come on.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.745
- You ready?
- Yeah.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.497
Open wide.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.333
I don't want you to feed me.
I just want you to pass it through.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.585
Okay.

18:06.211 --> 18:09.631
Great. This is good. Keep them coming.

18:11.967 --> 18:12.968
You're good.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.513
Wait. Don't move.

18:18.849 --> 18:19.850
Do you hear that?

18:19.850 --> 18:20.767
Hear what?

18:22.686 --> 18:25.939
Okay, continue. Come on.
Let's pick up the pace.

18:27.983 --> 18:28.984
That's right.

18:33.322 --> 18:34.323
It's stuck.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.161
Okay.

18:39.870 --> 18:41.955
- Last one.
- Yeah. Thank you.

18:42.873 --> 18:44.249
I've got to get that picture now.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.756
What are you doing?

18:50.756 --> 18:52.508
The party's back this way.

19:02.226 --> 19:04.436
<i>You've officially been waiting
a stupidly long time.</i>

19:05.812 --> 19:08.273
<i>I'm sure they won't be much longer,
but let's just crack on.</i>

19:08.273 --> 19:09.191
Okay.

19:09.191 --> 19:13.028
"How well does the following word
describe you?

19:13.028 --> 19:17.533
Sexy. Not at all, somewhat or very well?"

19:17.533 --> 19:19.368
I'd have to say somewhat sexy.

19:20.494 --> 19:21.328
What?

19:21.328 --> 19:22.246
No, nothing.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.456
I just didn't know you thought
so highly of yourself.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.291
Yeah. Well, I didn't say very sexy, did I?

19:26.291 --> 19:29.044
<i>I said somewhat sexy.
Like, I'm mildly sexy.</i>

19:29.044 --> 19:31.797
If I'm lucky and I don't feel bloated.

19:32.506 --> 19:33.507
How would you describe me?

19:33.507 --> 19:36.552
I don't know. Sometimes
you come across a bit like--

19:37.928 --> 19:39.888
Like a kindly milkman.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.977
- Put that then.
- <i>Okay. Last question.</i>

19:44.977 --> 19:47.521
"How skilled are you at the following?

19:47.521 --> 19:50.274
<i>Creating romance in a relationship.</i>

19:50.274 --> 19:53.360
Not at all skilled,
somewhat skilled or very skilled?"

19:53.360 --> 19:54.736
I have my moments, I suppose.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.822
Really?
I can't imagine you being romantic.

19:56.822 --> 19:59.116
Yeah. Course you can't,
because I'm Danny the kindly milkman.

19:59.116 --> 20:02.035
Well, go on then. When was
the last time you were romantic?

20:02.035 --> 20:05.122
- You remember Chloe?
- <i>Yes. I remember Chloe.</i>

20:05.122 --> 20:07.958
Okay. On our first date,
I hired a canalboat.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.377
Covered the whole thing in fairy lights.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.547
<i>We sailed down the Regent's Canal
watching the sunset,</i>

20:13.547 --> 20:15.757
<i>drinking the cheapest champagne imaginable.</i>

20:15.757 --> 20:17.342
Mainly 'cause I couldn't afford much else

20:17.342 --> 20:19.261
after hiring the boat, to be honest.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.097
But, yeah, it didn't matter.

20:22.931 --> 20:23.974
<i>We didn't care.</i>

20:25.851 --> 20:30.439
<i>We listened to a playlist
of romantic songs, and we just talked.</i>

20:32.065 --> 20:33.192
And we laughed.

20:35.611 --> 20:36.612
And then we stopped.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.866
And then from there,
we watched a firework display

20:40.866 --> 20:41.992
that was happening in the park.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.536
<i>Huddled under some blankets.</i>

20:50.501 --> 20:51.627
Is that any good?

20:53.253 --> 20:54.880
Yeah. That's pretty good.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.590
A bit tacky.

20:56.590 --> 21:00.344
It's Veggie. Oh, no.
She's awake and asking for me.

21:00.344 --> 21:03.263
I mean, that's a first.
She usually just wants <i>Peppa Pig</i>.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.057
Right, what am I doing?
I've got to get out of here.

21:05.057 --> 21:07.017
At last. Hallelujah. Go.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.187
Okay, Mr. Pharmacist, I'm coming in.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.858
What are you doing?

21:14.858 --> 21:16.527
I'm not leaving here without Peridyne.

21:16.527 --> 21:18.987
This is quite exciting. It's like
<i>Mission: Impossible</i> or something.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.907
Yeah, it is. I feel all tingly.
I can see why criminals do it, actually.

21:23.242 --> 21:24.868
Okay.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.122
Now what are you doing?

21:29.122 --> 21:32.334
Well, if I can't get a refund,
I'm gonna get my 200 quid's worth.

21:35.838 --> 21:36.880
Oh, my God.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.511
- Hello.
- I'm not stealing.

21:42.511 --> 21:44.179
- What?
- What?

21:45.013 --> 21:47.808
I'm here to pick up a prescription.
Mrs. Anne Cooper.

21:48.851 --> 21:50.143
What?

21:50.143 --> 21:52.855
I'm here for a prescription.
Mrs. Anne Cooper.

21:54.982 --> 21:55.983
What was the name?

21:55.983 --> 21:57.401
Mrs. Anne Cooper.

21:59.570 --> 22:00.612
Bear with me.

22:05.117 --> 22:06.410
You okay?

22:06.410 --> 22:09.663
Yeah. Just trying to remember
where I put the prescriptions.

22:09.663 --> 22:12.624
Are they not in one of
the blue prescription boxes?

22:15.169 --> 22:17.629
Seems like a good place to start,
doesn't it?

22:25.262 --> 22:27.139
- Here you go.
- How much?

22:27.806 --> 22:29.141
That's 9.35, please.

22:32.186 --> 22:34.646
- No. Can't use the card machine.
- Why not?

22:35.564 --> 22:36.565
Because I'm stupid.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.026
Do you have any cash?

22:45.699 --> 22:47.284
This is not my prescription.

22:47.284 --> 22:49.077
It's for Mr. Garfield Sununu.

22:49.870 --> 22:50.871
Are you not him?

22:50.871 --> 22:51.955
No.

22:51.955 --> 22:54.249
- What was the name?
- Anne Cooper.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.334
Just a sec.

23:16.647 --> 23:18.774
They said he'd been dead
for about three hours.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.819
I should finish
giving my statement to the police.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.281
I just feel so guilty.

23:26.281 --> 23:28.450
Come on. The paramedics said
he had a cardiac arrest.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.702
He died almost instantly.
He didn't suffer.

23:30.702 --> 23:33.539
It's just so sad, going like that,
all alone

23:33.539 --> 23:35.082
- <i>in the back.</i>
- You're kidding me, aren't you?

23:35.082 --> 23:37.000
Face down in a pile of drugs,
that's how I'd like to go.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.711
I'd prefer something
stronger than baby laxatives.

23:42.798 --> 23:43.799
You gonna be okay?

23:44.383 --> 23:46.301
Yeah. Of course. You know me.

23:46.301 --> 23:48.345
Yeah, I do. That's why I asked.

23:48.345 --> 23:50.722
There's only room for one morbid,
miserable twat in this relationship--

23:50.722 --> 23:51.849
friendship.

23:52.432 --> 23:55.561
And, you know, I've pretty much
got that position sewn up, so...

23:55.561 --> 23:57.771
Noted. Thank you.

23:58.689 --> 23:59.690
Anyway, look,

23:59.690 --> 24:01.984
it's probably time I stop annoying you
for another night.

24:01.984 --> 24:04.820
No. You can't go yet. We haven't
finished setting up your dating profile.

24:04.820 --> 24:07.030
Oh, yeah. Well, no,
we don't need to do that now.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.448
- We can do it--
- Yeah. No. Let's do it.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.825
It'll only take a few seconds,

24:09.825 --> 24:11.827
and then it'll start throwing up matches immediately.

24:11.827 --> 24:12.744
Ready?

24:13.912 --> 24:14.913
Done.

24:14.913 --> 24:17.207
Right. And so with these
matches, now, what do I--

24:17.207 --> 24:19.877
Do you have to e-mail them or something,
see if they wanna go for scones and stuff?

24:19.877 --> 24:24.715
<i>I mean, yeah. You're gonna
have to leave the flat eventually.</i>

24:28.135 --> 24:29.136
<i>You've got a match.</i>

24:30.804 --> 24:32.973
Ninety-one percent compatibility.

24:32.973 --> 24:35.767
Really? Okay. Well, what's she like?

24:35.767 --> 24:38.395
She is...

24:40.397 --> 24:41.565
I'm still on...

24:44.401 --> 24:45.694
Well?

24:49.907 --> 24:53.827
Yeah. No. Sorry. It's just a glitch.
No matches yet.

24:55.621 --> 24:56.997
Good. That's good.

24:56.997 --> 24:59.416
I should probably
let Veggie know what I'm doing.

24:59.416 --> 25:00.792
Yeah, of course. Same time next time?

25:00.792 --> 25:02.920
<i>Yes. Same time. Try and sleep.</i>

25:02.920 --> 25:04.379
All right. Good night, you maniac.

25:04.379 --> 25:05.464
All right. Night.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.046
At last. Thank you.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.017
How was Disneyland?
