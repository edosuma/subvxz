09:55.133 --> 09:57.600
SHE'S GONNA BE MAD.
YOU TALK TO HER.

09:57.600 --> 10:01.600
FINE. I'LL BE
THE ADULT HERE.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.100
LOOK, FIRST THINGS FIRST,

10:03.100 --> 10:04.967
I JUST WANT TO SAY I HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS,

10:04.967 --> 10:06.500
AND I COMPLETELY DISAPPROVE.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.867
[WHISPERS]
Calming her down.

10:08.867 --> 10:09.834
LOOK, JUST TELL ME
HE'S OK

10:09.834 --> 10:11.900
AND DOESN'T HAVE
ANY TATTOOS.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.000
HE'S OK,

10:13.000 --> 10:14.800
AND IT SAYS "MOM."

10:14.800 --> 10:15.500
[KURT LAUGHS]

10:15.500 --> 10:17.867
OH, COME ON,
HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.467
I MARRIED YOU,
DIDN'T I?

10:20.467 --> 10:22.400
THERE IT IS.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.900
SO, UH, YOU WANT
TO COME UP HERE
AND GET HIM?

10:25.900 --> 10:27.100
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.567
I WANT TO STAY WITH YOU!

10:28.567 --> 10:31.500
HE SAYS HE REALLY
MISSES YOU.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.734
I HEARD.

10:32.734 --> 10:33.967
THANKS FOR TRYIN'.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.367
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO?

10:35.367 --> 10:39.200
LOOK, NEXT WEEK IS
SPRING BREAK, ANYWAY.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.300
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
KEEP HIM WITH YOU?

10:42.300 --> 10:44.000
IF I MAKE HIM
COME HOME NOW,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.967
HE'LL RESENT ME
MORE THAN EVER.

10:45.967 --> 10:47.200
WHAT'S SHE SAYING?

10:47.200 --> 10:48.867
DID SHE SAY
I CAN STAY?

10:48.867 --> 10:50.300
WELL, YEAH, BUT--
YAY!

10:50.300 --> 10:53.000
THANKS, MOM!
LOVE YOU, BYE!

10:53.000 --> 10:54.767
DAD SAYS BYE, TOO.

10:54.767 --> 10:56.767
I DIDN'T
GET TO TALK TO HER.

10:56.767 --> 10:59.600
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU DON'T KNOW HER.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.467
AND NOW I NEVER WILL.

11:05.033 --> 11:06.800
HE WANTS TO STAY
WITH YOUR DAD.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.000
DON'T FEEL BAD, MOM.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.967
YOU MAY NOT BE
THE FUN PARENT,

11:10.967 --> 11:14.367
BUT KIDS NEED
A DULL PARENT, TOO.

11:17.233 --> 11:21.100
THAT'S IT! DO YOU FEEL IT?
DO YOU FEEL THE BURN?

11:21.100 --> 11:23.033
I FELT THE BURN
AN HOUR AGO.

11:23.033 --> 11:25.400
NOW IT'S
SEARING PAIN!

11:25.400 --> 11:27.834
I AM NEVER GOING TO
GET AN "A" THIS WAY.

11:27.834 --> 11:28.567
I MEAN, JUST
YESTERDAY,

11:28.567 --> 11:32.934
SISTER MARY FREDO
SAID SHE'D USE MY

11:54.900 --> 11:58.200
IT'S A PROUD DAY
WHEN A SON BEATS
HIS FATHER

11:58.200 --> 11:59.600
IN A BELCHING
CONTEST.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.400
CAN WE GET BACK
TO THE GAME NOW, PLEASE?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.367
I'LL SEE YOUR
3 ANIMAL CRACKERS

12:04.367 --> 12:08.033
AND RAISE YOU
A CHOCOLATE COVERED

12:08.033 --> 12:09.367

12:09.367 --> 12:11.934
YOU KNOW,
I'M STILL HUNGRY.

12:11.934 --> 12:13.467
WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE
TO EAT?

12:13.467 --> 12:14.967
WHAT DON'T WE HAVE?

12:14.967 --> 12:16.600
WE GOT YOUR

12:33.400 --> 12:36.600
I THOUGHT SOMETHIN'
DIED IN HERE.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.367
YOU KNOW, DAD, THIS IS
EVEN BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.

12:41.367 --> 12:43.200
IF MY SCHOOL BUS
WAS LIKE THIS,

12:43.200 --> 12:45.767
I WOULDN'T MIND
GOIN' TO SCHOOL.

WAITING AROUND.

15:15.867 --> 15:17.700

DONE IT THEN,

15:17.700 --> 15:18.600

UNDERSTAND QUANTUM
PHYSICS.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.400

17:47.700 --> 17:48.500
WELL, WHEN YOU SEE HIM,

17:48.500 --> 17:49.700
TELL HIM TO MEET ME
AT THE PARK

17:49.700 --> 17:53.500
AND HAVE HIM BRING
HIS MITT, KNEE PADS,
AND A SNORKEL. HEH.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.300
WHOO!

17:56.500 --> 18:01.000
I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO KNOW WHAT
SHE HAD IN MIND.

18:03.300 --> 18:03.934

18:03.934 --> 18:05.900
WHAT, IS IT TIME
FOR THE NEXT SHOW?

18:05.900 --> 18:08.467
NO, IT'S NOON. I'M BORED.

18:08.467 --> 18:09.967
I HAVE NO ONE
TO PLAY WITH.

18:09.967 --> 18:11.900
WHAT'S DEREK DOING?

18:11.900 --> 18:14.700
HUGGING A CHICKEN.

18:15.767 --> 18:18.200
DAD, LET'S GO OUTSIDE
AND PLAY SOME CATCH.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.934
WE CAN'T. WE'RE GOING
60 MILES AN HOUR.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.300
DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:23.300 --> 18:24.867
YOU USED TO BE
SO MUCH FUN.

18:24.867 --> 18:28.233
WELL, THAT'S
BECAUSE WHEN I WOULD
VISIT YOU GUYS,

18:28.233 --> 18:29.400
I WAS ON VACATION.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.700
NOW I'M WORKING.

18:30.700 --> 18:31.734
YOU WERE SLEEPING.

18:31.734 --> 18:35.567
WELL, BECAUSE MY JOB
INVOLVES ME STAYING
UP ALL NIGHT

18:35.567 --> 18:36.467
TO PLAY MUSIC

18:36.467 --> 18:37.033
AND SLEEPING ALL DAY

18:37.033 --> 18:39.467
SO I CAN STAY UP
ALL NIGHT TO PLAY
MORE MUSIC.

18:39.467 --> 18:41.300
THEN WHY'D YOU ASK ME
TO COME?

18:41.300 --> 18:44.567
I NEVER THOUGHT YOUR MOM
WOULD SAY YES.

18:44.567 --> 18:47.800
OH.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.967
HEY, ZACK...

18:52.967 --> 18:55.767

18:55.767 --> 19:01.033
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT
IN A BAD WAY.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.700
IT'S JUST THAT
I WANT YOU HERE, BABE,

19:03.700 --> 19:05.767
BUT IT'S HARD BEING
THE FUN PARENT

19:05.767 --> 19:07.500
AND WORKING
AT THE SAME TIME.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.233
NOW YOU SOUND LIKE MOM,

19:09.233 --> 19:12.767
BUT UNLIKE HER,
YOU CAN'T HELP ME
WITH MY HOMEWORK,

19:12.767 --> 19:15.100
YOU'RE NEVER AWAKE
WHEN I'M AWAKE,

19:15.100 --> 19:17.200
AND MOM MAKES SURE
I'M IN THE CAR

19:17.200 --> 19:19.500
BEFORE SHE DRIVES OFF.

19:19.500 --> 19:23.233
WE POPPED A U-IE
AND CAME RIGHT BACK.

19:24.734 --> 19:27.200
DAD, TAKE A SEAT.

19:33.100 --> 19:37.600
LOOK, WHEN THIS STARTED OUT,
IT WAS GREAT.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.000
WE HAD A LOT OF LAUGHS,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.767
A LOT OF FUN,

19:41.767 --> 19:44.100
BUT I JUST CAN'T LIVE
THIS WAY ANYMORE.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.734
DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

19:46.734 --> 19:48.400
BUT I'M GOING HOME
TO MOTHER.

19:48.400 --> 19:52.000
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOUR MOM SAID
WHEN SHE LEFT ME,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.400
AND A FEW OTHER THINGS
THAT I CAN'T MENTION.

19:58.367 --> 20:00.600
ARE YOU GONNA
BE OK, DAD?

20:00.600 --> 20:03.400
YEAH.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.300
BUT IT'S NOT ME
