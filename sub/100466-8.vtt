49:02.022 --> 49:04.567
Rendezvous with Bravo One
as soon as we approach.

49:04.650 --> 49:05.609
Bravo One?

49:05.693 --> 49:06.610
VERADA SETHU:
It's a punch in the gut.

49:06.986 --> 49:08.988
There's only a three or four day
difference between

49:09.155 --> 49:12.158
Munich when Mac dies
and then, you know,

49:12.241 --> 49:13.701
they're moving straight on
to the next mission.

49:13.993 --> 49:14.910
Sorry, it's just‐‐

49:14.994 --> 49:16.996
Yes, I know,
McAllister's call sign.

49:17.997 --> 49:18.956
We move on.

49:19.707 --> 49:21.000
WOMAN: (OVER RADIO)
Bravo One, sitrep.

49:21.083 --> 49:22.501
DANIEL MACPHERSON:
Yeah, we first see Wyatt

49:22.585 --> 49:24.545
as a sniper doing recon
on these guys.

49:24.753 --> 49:26.255
And you can see from
the first time we see him

49:26.338 --> 49:27.923
that there's a rage burning
in those eyes.

49:28.007 --> 49:29.133
Well, I hope you can see that
anyway. (CHUCKLES)

49:29.216 --> 49:32.219
‐MAN: Bravo One, distract now.
‐Copy.

49:36.932 --> 49:38.225
(GUNFIRE)

49:38.309 --> 49:40.186
JACK LOTHIAN: I think the thing
with this section is

49:40.269 --> 49:42.438
they've never really had
to deal with grief like this

49:42.521 --> 49:44.190
before losing one of their own.

49:44.273 --> 49:45.232
Hold on!

49:45.566 --> 49:47.568
LOTHIAN: So, it's very much
a family who are in denial

49:47.651 --> 49:49.153
about death
and kind of push on

49:49.236 --> 49:50.696
and deal with it
in their own ways.

49:50.779 --> 49:53.157
Ways which usually involve,
sort of gunfire,

49:53.240 --> 49:55.367
explosions and violence.

49:56.327 --> 49:57.786
Which is why
when they finally end up

49:57.870 --> 49:59.288
hanging over the edge
of a cliff...

49:59.872 --> 50:02.041
‐(TIRES SCREECHING)
‐(GRUNTING)

50:02.750 --> 50:04.835
...it's the one time they can
sort of take a breath

50:04.919 --> 50:06.504
and discuss what's happened.

50:07.379 --> 50:09.423
(SCREAMING)

50:11.800 --> 50:13.052
That was really cool.

50:13.135 --> 50:15.513
I remember the actual cliff
being like, 20 meters high.

50:15.596 --> 50:17.181
John Strickland,
the director at the time,

50:17.431 --> 50:20.309
didn't dissuade us from going
to the humorous place

50:20.392 --> 50:22.228
for some, you know,
eccentric body language

50:22.311 --> 50:23.729
as we're dangling off
the edge of this thing.

50:23.896 --> 50:26.315
I am gonna try and back us up.

50:26.398 --> 50:28.859
So, I think at one point
Coltrane had like, his leg up

50:28.943 --> 50:32.321
on the roof and Novin was like,
with her face on the windscreen.

50:32.404 --> 50:34.448
I think the director,
John Strickland, was like,

50:34.532 --> 50:35.783
"Ah, maybe not that steep."

50:35.991 --> 50:38.702
‐Real slow.
‐Yeah, really slow.

50:38.786 --> 50:41.038
Secretly, I've discovered
Novin has a fear of heights.

50:41.121 --> 50:43.082
It's really what cracks me up
about this job

50:43.165 --> 50:45.167
because sometimes it's so big
that people say,

50:45.251 --> 50:46.335
"Ah, that's CGI."

50:46.418 --> 50:49.129
There was nothing green‐screened
about that.

50:49.213 --> 50:50.506
(CHUCKLING)

50:50.589 --> 50:53.759
And also, talking about Mac
in the most inopportune moment.

50:53.842 --> 50:55.177
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

50:55.261 --> 50:57.513
Mac used to hate when I'd drive.
(CHUCKLES)

50:57.596 --> 51:00.099
He always said I was
a fucking terrible driver.

51:00.683 --> 51:02.017
ALEXANDER COLTRANE:
You're not a terrible driver.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.019
A terrible driver would've
taken us all the way

51:04.103 --> 51:05.271
over the edge.

51:06.105 --> 51:07.064
(CHUCKLES) Bloody hell.

51:07.147 --> 51:09.024
And again, I love Jack's writing
of going,

51:09.108 --> 51:10.901
"This is the moment where you're
gonna choose to talk about it,"

51:10.985 --> 51:12.695
which is the most
precarious moment you can find.

51:12.778 --> 51:14.196
It's where you've got
a van stuck,

51:14.280 --> 51:15.364
teetering on the edge
of a cliff.

51:15.447 --> 51:17.199
"Well, let's talk about
our lost buddy."

51:17.283 --> 51:19.368
And then, bang!
The side mirror gets shot out.

51:19.451 --> 51:21.912
And we're back on mission
and we're off.
