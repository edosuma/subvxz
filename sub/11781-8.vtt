WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.078
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.779
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.812 --> 00:12.780
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.382
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:14.415 --> 00:17.185
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:17.218 --> 00:20.088
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.822
Previously on
Jane by Design...

00:21.855 --> 00:22.790
It's all good.
I've got this, Cam.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.558
How'd this dirtbag get
in the party anyhow?

00:24.592 --> 00:25.759
You're right, bro.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.361
Look, he doesn't want
any trouble, okay?
He's just...

00:27.395 --> 00:28.562
He's just trash.

00:28.596 --> 00:29.263
You can dress up
all you want,

00:29.297 --> 00:32.600
but you're still
trash, too.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.336
Even if you'd
been kidnapped
by a family of senators,

00:35.369 --> 00:37.171
you'd still want to
be a baseball player.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.206
What?

00:38.239 --> 00:39.240
Nothing. It's just...

00:39.273 --> 00:42.343
I'm enjoying this.
Getting to know you better.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.345
Me, too.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.115
And that's why my new
accessories line for spring
is the next big thing.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.616
And that thing is neon.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.451
Neo-African neon.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.120
(SNICKERS)

00:52.153 --> 00:53.354
Do you have something
to add, Jane?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.089
Maybe young people
are interested in
what's new, but...

00:55.123 --> 00:58.092
They want to
define themselves.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.327
Interesting point, Jane.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.828
It is?

01:00.861 --> 01:02.396
The problem with taking
on someone like India

01:02.430 --> 01:04.232
is that you're taking
on someone like India.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.467
You put yourself
in the tiger's cage,

01:06.500 --> 01:08.536
expect to get bitten.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.376
JANE: Every pattern begins
with one thin line,

01:17.645 --> 01:20.448
then comes to life
with each stroke,

01:20.481 --> 01:22.616
becoming more and more complex
as the design takes shape.

01:22.650 --> 01:26.554
* There's a rough road

01:26.587 --> 01:29.257
* That is less chosen

01:29.290 --> 01:34.462
* Because it requires
some yielding

01:34.495 --> 01:36.597
JANE: Life is sort of like
a dress pattern.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.632
It can start simply,

01:38.666 --> 01:42.303
but suddenly become
hopelessly complicated.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.141
Oh! I'm late.

01:49.677 --> 01:54.648
* 'Cause life
It runs out too soon

01:55.216 --> 01:59.287
* And all that I wanna do

02:01.355 --> 02:05.593
* Give the world a love
that is true *

02:08.429 --> 02:10.364
Are you sure
you want to do this?

02:14.202 --> 02:22.910
I do.

02:22.943 --> 02:26.714
* I've my heart where
my head should be

02:26.747 --> 02:30.284
* Light up the rest of me

02:30.318 --> 02:33.654
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

02:33.687 --> 02:34.955
* Through the stops,
the starts

02:34.988 --> 02:38.392
* And life is a work of art

02:41.495 --> 02:44.232
So, we've got Wrightsville
this weekend.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.934
I was talking with them
last week and they said

02:46.967 --> 02:48.502
they're gonna beat us.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.704
You know what,
that was last season.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.673
So, let's get pumped

02:52.706 --> 02:54.508
'cause we're gonna
crush them!

02:54.542 --> 02:54.775
(ALL CHEERING)

02:57.611 --> 02:59.713
Jane, seriously,
why are we even here?

02:59.747 --> 03:00.881
I thought we hated
pep rallies.

03:00.914 --> 03:04.685
Historically, yes.
But we're playing
Wrightsville,

03:04.718 --> 03:06.287
and they're
our archrivals.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.256
I didn't realize
we had archrivals.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.323
Of course we do.

03:09.357 --> 03:12.493
(WHOOPING)

03:12.526 --> 03:13.694
And we lost to them
last year,

03:13.727 --> 03:15.263
so this is a really
important rematch.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.732
Or is it a replay?
A reboot?

03:18.766 --> 03:22.470
What? There was a whole
editorial about it
in the school paper.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.605
(ALL CHEERING)

03:28.576 --> 03:30.478
Too cool for
the wave now?

03:30.511 --> 03:31.812
On the contrary.
Not cool enough.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.284
Yes!

03:42.022 --> 03:42.656
See, that wasn't
so bad, was it?

03:42.690 --> 03:44.592
(CHUCKLES)

03:44.625 --> 03:46.794
Jane!

03:46.827 --> 03:47.227
Hi..

03:50.698 --> 03:52.533
So, are you pumped?

03:52.566 --> 03:54.435
Are you ready
to crush...
Ooh! Sorry.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.271
I was kidding.

03:57.305 --> 03:57.638
I know.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.407
(GIGGLES)

04:03.711 --> 04:06.414
Right, you know,
I think I'm gonna
get out of here.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.816
Oh, wait.
No, no, no, no!
Stay. Right?

04:08.849 --> 04:11.018
Right.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.252
Right!

04:12.286 --> 04:14.522
Look, man, I'm sorry
about the other night
at my party.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.424
Cam, guy's a jerk.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.292
Yeah, it's fine.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.360
If I had known
thatNo worries.on...

04:19.393 --> 04:20.628
...I wouldn't have let it
get soIt's fine.ntrol.

04:21.862 --> 04:26.700
Okay. Well, this is good.

04:26.734 --> 04:31.739
We've now cleared the air.
And so we are all good, right?

04:32.473 --> 04:33.541
Yeah.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.409
Sure.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.445
Okay. So, we're still
on for tonight.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.580
The three of us
at The Rack.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.649
Just some pool. Some food.
Super simple stuff.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.452
AI can't tonight, I.....

04:44.485 --> 04:47.655
Okay, look,
we are doing this.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.791
You are my best friend,
and you are...

04:50.824 --> 04:53.694
Well, I guess we're still
figuring that out.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.330
Yeah, we are.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.366
All right,
I'll see you
guys tonight.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.533
AtAll right.y?

05:02.503 --> 05:04.372
What?

05:05.806 --> 05:08.809
Why are you
making me do this?

05:08.842 --> 05:12.646
Because things have been
tense between you guys
ever since Nick's party.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.548
Yeah, that's because
you were right.

05:14.582 --> 05:17.518
We're not like
those people, Janey.
We never were.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.853
And trying
to fit in, it's...

05:19.887 --> 05:20.788
It's just not worth it.
Trust me.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.891
Nick is different, Billy.
And I like him.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.362
Please give him a chance.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.664
I never asked you
to hang out with Lulu.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.500
Exactly. You never asked.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.669
(SCOFFS) What?
So, if I would've asked...

05:35.703 --> 05:37.738
Well, I guess we'll
never know, will we?

05:38.939 --> 05:41.141
Have you talked
to her at all?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.810
Nope.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.712
(SIGHS) Just say
you'll go tonight, okay?

05:45.679 --> 05:46.847
For me?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.884
Fine.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.454
You never know. I mean,
maybe you guys will have
so much in common.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.556
Yeah, I hate to break it
to you, Janey,

05:55.589 --> 05:58.459
but Fadden and I,
zero in common, all right?

05:58.492 --> 05:59.760
Other than you.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.163
Don't you have
a train to catch?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.432
Yes, let's go.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.906
That's my favorite
one of them.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.944
Your mom was
really pretty.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.913
Yeah. I'm sure
she still is.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.850
(SIGHING)
Wherever she is.

06:25.853 --> 06:26.954
I've got to get to work.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.756
Thank you.

06:28.789 --> 06:29.957
I will see you
tonight, okay?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.868
Jane...

06:40.901 --> 06:41.469
Billy, you promised.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.838
I'll be there for you.

06:44.872 --> 06:45.405
I'll see you at 8:00.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.490
Hey, what's
going on?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.191
Shh.

07:04.224 --> 07:04.725
Oh, my God.
Is that...

07:04.758 --> 07:07.595
Charlotte Whitmore.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.729
What?
Are you telling me...

07:08.762 --> 07:09.863
Donovan designed
her wedding dress.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.932
Just arrived from Paris.

07:11.965 --> 07:12.966
CARTER: You're kidding.
I mean, she is
practically...

07:13.000 --> 07:13.834
American royalty?

07:13.867 --> 07:16.470
There's no such thing.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.204
Close enough.
You realize
she's marrying...

07:17.237 --> 07:19.740
The crown prince
Yeah, we know.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.710
We also read
from time to time.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.878
So, Donovan scored
the gown of the year,
but I'm confused.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.580
Since when do we
design wedding dresses?

07:26.614 --> 07:27.848
Until now.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.483
It was a major coup,
very top secret.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.952
Donovan dazzled
the bride.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.655
And now every
who's who and
Page Six in the city...

07:34.688 --> 07:35.956
Um, in the country.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.858
...will be talking
about Donovan Decker

07:37.891 --> 07:39.860
designing
the Whitmore
wedding gown.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.895
And you two aren't
excited because...

07:41.929 --> 07:44.498
Because this...

07:44.532 --> 07:46.634
Is the moment
of truth.

07:49.537 --> 07:53.507
(EXHALES)

07:53.541 --> 07:54.041
I don't know.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.545
You don't know.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.813
Oh, all right.

08:00.848 --> 08:01.915
What don't you like?

08:01.949 --> 08:04.585
I said I don't know.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.689
I'm just not sure
this is it.

08:10.958 --> 08:11.792
Charlotte, if I may,

08:11.825 --> 08:15.062
I think you look
stunning in this dress.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.565
Yes, but is it
the one?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.500
I believe it is.

08:21.802 --> 08:22.836
(ALL MURMURING APPROVAL)

08:24.705 --> 08:25.873
What do you think?

08:25.906 --> 08:26.574
I think
it's perfect.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.544
And you?

08:30.578 --> 08:31.945
Oh, love it.
Perfection.

What's your name?

08:41.722 --> 08:44.958
Um, Jane. It's Jane.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.594
Do you like
my wedding dress, Jane?

08:47.828 --> 08:49.797
I, um...

08:49.830 --> 08:52.099
Jane, this is
Miss Whitmore.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.133
Oh. Hi.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.638
Miss Charlotte Whitmore.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.107
Great. Okay.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.776
Well, now that
we've got all that
straightened out,

09:02.810 --> 09:04.878
back to my question.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.615
Do you like my
wedding dress, Jane?

09:09.750 --> 09:10.884
I...

09:11.885 --> 09:13.754
Love it.

like about it?

Oh, I didn't say
that I didn't like it.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.743
I said I love it,
which is...

09:37.177 --> 09:38.378
Yes, you did.

09:38.411 --> 09:43.083
(STAMMERING)
I think she was just
pausing in admiration.

09:45.986 --> 09:46.987
Jane,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.024
this is my
wedding dress.

09:51.058 --> 09:54.762
This is the most
important dress
I will ever put on.

09:54.795 --> 09:55.663
Do you understand?

09:56.964 --> 10:01.702
All eyes will be on me,
and this dress...

10:01.735 --> 10:04.204
This dress needs
to be perfect.
It needs to be the one.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.209
So, please.
Tell me the truth.

10:10.878 --> 10:11.611
What do you think
of this dress?

10:15.916 --> 10:18.819
Go on, Jane.
Tell her the truth.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.789
Yes, Jane.
Tell Miss Whitmore
what you think of the dress.

10:21.822 --> 10:22.890
You want me to...

10:22.923 --> 10:24.057
Yes, go on.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.026
Tell her.

10:26.059 --> 10:26.126
Okay. Well, I think...

10:33.834 --> 10:36.904
It's a little fussy.

10:38.939 --> 10:39.973
Exactly.

10:42.242 --> 10:49.683
Fussy.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.084
I think what Jane
meant was...

10:51.118 --> 10:54.221
She meant what
she said, Mr. Jones.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.691
Now, my wedding is
in exactly three weeks.

10:57.725 --> 11:02.195
I'm giving Donovan Decker
until noon tomorrow
to come up with a new dress.

11:02.229 --> 11:06.199
No, with the perfect
new dress!

11:06.233 --> 11:08.201
Or I'm moving on
with another designer.

11:18.779 --> 11:19.279
I'm sorry.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.824
We have an extremely
high-profile client with
a non-negotiable deadline.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.460
Donovan worked
on that wedding dress
for months, Jane.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.095
And now...

11:35.128 --> 11:37.831
I know. I didn't realize
who she was at first, and...

11:37.865 --> 11:39.499
Charlotte Whitmore
is the sort of person

11:39.532 --> 11:42.803
who can put a designer's
name on the map.

11:42.836 --> 11:43.503
Who can take us
to the next level.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.038
I'm really sorry.

11:45.072 --> 11:48.008
It's a little late
for sorry, Jane.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.845
In Jane's defense,
we did tell her to be
honest with Charlotte.

11:51.879 --> 11:52.880
You're never honest
with the client.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.816
YouNever.t?

11:55.849 --> 11:58.251
Okay. What are you
supposed to tell them?

11:58.285 --> 11:59.486
What they want to hear.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.854
Nothing more.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.188
Nothing less.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.056
Got it.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.827
Charlotte's given us
until noon tomorrow

12:06.860 --> 12:08.762
before she goes
to another designer.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.932
Donovan is on a plane
for the next six hours.
There's no time.

12:11.965 --> 12:15.936
I have an idea.
Maybe Jeremy could
work on it and...

12:15.969 --> 12:19.039
Or not. Or not. Not.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.174
She's right.
You'll have to do it, Jeremy.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.976
You have to redesign
the gown.

12:23.010 --> 12:26.313
Me? But I don't do
wedding dresses.

12:26.346 --> 12:26.947
Now you do.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.252
If we do not pull this off,
we're gonna look like idiots.
Do you understand?

12:32.285 --> 12:34.554
That dress needs
to be perfect.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.923
I'll call you back
in a few hours.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.225
BGray!!

12:41.128 --> 12:43.163
So, tell me everything.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.965
How's the Whitmore
wedding dress
coming along?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.835
HonYes.y?

12:47.868 --> 12:49.837
Well, it's a show-stopper.

12:49.870 --> 12:53.773
Oh, boy! Goody, goody!

13:01.114 --> 13:02.950
Um...

13:02.983 --> 13:06.353
Well, look at it this way.
I mean, if anyone
can do it, you can.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.155
Jane, this is serious.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.090
No, I know.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.893
And it's not your fault.
It's mine.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.863
If I can't turn this
wedding gown around,

13:15.896 --> 13:18.065
your little outburst
may very well have
cost me my job.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.400
I'm really sorry.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.238
It's okay.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.041
Just get ready
for a long night.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.858
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

13:54.201 --> 13:55.335
WhHey, Billy.ck?

13:57.270 --> 13:59.139
Where's Jane?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.909
Oh, she'll be here.
She usually runs about
15 minutes late or so.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.078
You're 15 minutes late.

14:05.112 --> 14:08.015
Yeah. Sorry about that.
You know, I had to have
Ben drop me off.

14:08.048 --> 14:08.882
We don't all have cars.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.151
I didn't mean it that way.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.119
Oh, it's cool.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.124
So.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.158
So.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.326
You been here long?

14:19.359 --> 14:20.928
About Right.utes.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.062
You know, that
doesn't surprise me.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.032
Nothing.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.233
No. What doesn't
surprise you?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.902
Oh, you just have
a very punctual vibe.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.170
I have a punctual vibe?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.905
Yeah. You seem like
the kind of guy

14:31.939 --> 14:34.074
who would never
be late for anything.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.308
Is that a bad thing?

14:35.342 --> 14:38.278
No, no! Not at all.
It's who you are.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.680
I mean, personally,
I like to keep 'em guessing.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.114
Keep Exactly.sing?

14:46.286 --> 14:49.156
So did you get here early
just so you could warm up
on the pool table?

14:49.189 --> 14:49.923
I didn't get here early.
I was on time.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.459
Okay. Fair enough.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.094
You any good?

14:54.127 --> 14:56.429
AYeah.l?

14:56.463 --> 14:58.431
Let's just say pool
is not my best sport.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.232
It'What?ame.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.234
Pool. You just
called it a sport.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.336
I think it's
considered a sport.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.438
No way, dude.
It's a game.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.241
Okay, fine. Whatever.
Let's just wait for Jane.

15:16.116 --> 15:16.849
I need ideas
and I need them fast.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.351
What about you?
What've you got?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.089
No. You?

15:23.190 --> 15:24.357
That's terrible.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.193
You.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.129
Really?

15:29.162 --> 15:32.232
I'm going under here, people.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.302
Haven't any of you
got anything?

15:35.335 --> 15:38.972
I've got until tomorrow to
pull this out of a tailspin
and if I can't...

15:39.006 --> 15:43.243
Wait.
Do you hear that?
That ticking noise?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.278
That's not a clock.
That's a time bomb!

15:47.780 --> 15:48.181
I meant my career.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.486
You know what? It's late.
We're all out of ideas.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.055
We're tired.
You should just go.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.158
Go home. All of you.

16:02.329 --> 16:05.398
I'll just sit here,
alone, failing.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.035
Wow.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.137
You really know
how to empty a place.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.504
Well, you're still here.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.007
We're not gonna leave you.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.543
Especially not in your
time of incredibly
self-composed need.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.179
What am I gonna do?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.315
It's gonna be fine.

16:22.349 --> 16:25.385
WYou will?.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.486
Of course we will.

16:28.188 --> 16:34.327
Thank you.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.195
BILLY: Thanks.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.471
Dude, feel free to dig in.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.339
No, thanks. I'm good.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.375
What, you don't like nachos?

16:48.408 --> 16:51.211
I love nachos.
I just think we should
wait for Jane. It's polite.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.346
That's another
vibe you have.

16:54.347 --> 16:54.981
What? The polite vibe?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.317
Yep. And I mean no offense.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.155
Can you check on Jane?

17:02.189 --> 17:03.156
I told you.
She'll be here.

17:04.157 --> 17:07.494
Mmm, there she is now.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.501
What'd she say?

17:14.534 --> 17:17.437
Remember when I said,
"She'll be here"?

17:17.470 --> 17:18.571
She's not coming.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.473
She said to say
sheRight.ry.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.542
Internship.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.378
Apparently the most
demanding internship
in the world.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.579
Does your girlfriend
do this to you?

17:26.613 --> 17:28.515
Make you wait
and not show up places?

17:28.548 --> 17:32.119
I don't like to discuss
my personal life. No offense.

17:32.152 --> 17:32.252
Right. You like
to keep 'em guessing.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.090
Exactly.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.559
Wait. Time out.
Did you just refer to Jane
as your girlfriend?

17:39.592 --> 17:42.095
No, I didn't.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.131
It kind of sounded
like you did.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.100
Well, I mean,
we've kind of been getting
pretty close in the last...

17:47.134 --> 17:48.868
You know, actually,
scratch that.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.504
I really don't like
to talk about other people's
personal lives either.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.841
All right.
This has been great
and a lot of fun.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.543
But I think I'm gonna
head out, Billy.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.411
Look, you know...

17:59.879 --> 18:04.384
Jane organized tonight
so that we could get
to know each other better.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.419
Seemed important to her.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.488
That's certainly
going well.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.589
You know I like nachos.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.425
Everybody
likes nachos.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.562
You know I'm better
than you at pool.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.397
I never said you were
better than me.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.267
I said it wasn't
my best sport.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.868
It's a game. And that
sounds like a challenge.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.069
Grab a stick, Fadden.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.641
Okay.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.317
How's it going?

18:37.350 --> 18:39.619
Honestly, I've been
sketching for hours.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.521
I've tried everything,
beaded fishtails,

18:41.554 --> 18:42.255
Victorian ball gowns,
Grecian columns...

18:42.289 --> 18:43.690
You'll come up
with something.

18:43.723 --> 18:48.161
And what if I don't?
Hmm? If I blow this.

18:48.195 --> 18:51.398
If I publicly humiliate
Donovan Decker.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.699
You and I both know
I'll be out of here
faster than Diaz,

18:52.732 --> 18:56.469
and those two worked
together for years.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.439
Everything I've worked for
my entire life, gone.
Just like that.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.309
Maybe I could help you.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.612
Help me design
the wedding gown.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.346
It's a little bit out
of your area of expertise.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.198
(SIGHS)

19:59.699 --> 20:03.270
All right. I'll admit it.
You're better than me at pool.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.537
Oh, I know that was
difficult for you.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.005
Still better than you
at baseball, though.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.774
Uh, not necessarily.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.777
You're not serious.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.247
I've never played.
Therefore it's impossible
to know my true potential.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.248
I could have
Hall of Fame talent.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.616
You know, that's what
Lulu used to tell me.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.018
So, what happened?

20:19.051 --> 20:21.488
Aimless youth.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.490
No, no, no.
What happened
with you and Lulu?

20:23.523 --> 20:25.392
I mean, you were all
in-crowd for a minute,

20:25.425 --> 20:26.693
then a total
180 the next.
What gives?

20:26.826 --> 20:29.429
Just wasn't for me.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.264
And Lulu?

20:31.298 --> 20:32.532
I guess I just
wasn't for her.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.666
Did she tell you that?

20:33.700 --> 20:34.501
She didn't have to.

20:34.534 --> 20:37.270
Well, I mean, unless
you talk to her,

20:37.304 --> 20:38.671
you'll never really
know for sure.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.473
You know, we really
don't have to do this
whole girl talk thing.

20:41.073 --> 20:41.474
Got it.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.648
Rack 'em.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.518
Nice shot.

20:51.551 --> 20:55.655
So, what do you say
we make it a little more
interesting this time?

20:55.688 --> 20:57.290
You just want
to take my money.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.492
No. Not at all.

20:59.526 --> 21:00.727
I really think
you're starting to
get the hang of it.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.298
If you say so.

21:05.332 --> 21:05.532
Can I get
you guys a drink?

21:09.436 --> 21:10.403
I'm good.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.705
(MOUTHING)

21:12.739 --> 21:15.308
Yeah. I'll take a beer.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.514
Thank you.

Some of my best work.

These just arrived for
you from someone named

Who is he?

22:00.387 --> 22:01.253

Well, whoever he is,
he has great taste.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.359
In flowers, that is.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.495
(CHUCKLES) Funny.
You can leave now.

22:12.799 --> 22:13.800
Ouch.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.370
You're still here.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.538
It's just a shame to see
such beautiful flowers
go to waste.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.644
I'm not interested in Richard.
Or his flowers.
Is that a problem?

22:24.677 --> 22:26.479
Not my business.

22:26.513 --> 22:29.382
True. Oh, and Carter,
can you not mention
this to anyone?

22:31.684 --> 22:33.386
Don't look at me like that.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.522
I'm sort of seeing
someone else right now,

22:35.555 --> 22:37.390
and I wouldn't want them
to get the wrong idea, so...

22:39.826 --> 22:41.561
It's no one you know, it's...

22:42.194 --> 22:44.631
What?.

22:44.664 --> 22:45.832
Everyone knows.

22:45.865 --> 22:46.966
I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.636
Fine. Have it your way.

23:05.552 --> 23:06.486
Hey, Jane, could you
help me find that

23:06.519 --> 23:08.621
bolt of silk chiffon
Jeremy was asking for?

23:08.655 --> 23:09.856
Oh, yeah. Sure thing.

23:44.591 --> 23:47.527
Yes!

23:47.560 --> 23:49.862
It's perfect.
Where'd you get this?

23:49.896 --> 23:52.765
I... It's...

23:53.600 --> 23:54.601
Is this yours?

23:57.737 --> 23:59.472
Well, actually, it's...

23:59.506 --> 24:00.540
Brilliant.

24:00.573 --> 24:00.640
Perfect, simple.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.579
I love it, India.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.647
You do?

24:07.680 --> 24:10.683
I really do.

24:10.717 --> 24:12.885
Are you sure you're okay
with me using this?
Your design?

24:12.919 --> 24:15.922
Of course I am.
I wanted to help.

24:18.825 --> 24:23.596
I can't believe
you did this for me.
I'm touched. Really, I am.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.498
I didn't realize
you had this in you.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.868
This is a beautiful dress.

24:30.269 --> 24:31.070
Thank you.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.706
You're welcome.

24:41.080 --> 24:41.948
Rack 'em.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.684
You hustled me.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.555
I can't believe
I just fell for that.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.757
Hey, look, if it makes
you feel any better,
you're not that bad.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.058
It doesn't make me
feel any better
at all, all right?

24:52.091 --> 24:55.294
You lied. So much for
that whole honest vibe.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.296
Whoa, I never lied.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.532
Hey, you lied, all right.
You said you weren't
good at pool.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.568
No, I said it wasn't
my best sport.

25:01.601 --> 25:04.270
It's a game, first off.
And you still lied.

25:04.303 --> 25:06.939
No, I didn't.
I'm really, really
good at baseball.

25:06.973 --> 25:09.075
Oh, I get it, man.
You're good at everything.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.309
What's that
supposed to mean?

25:10.342 --> 25:13.012
Nothing.
It was a compliment.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.981
Didn't sound like
a compliment.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.550
Hey, I'd like to be
good at everything.

25:17.584 --> 25:20.820
To be rich. To always win.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.089
I'd like to have
everything handed to me.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.324
I didn't have anything
handed to me.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.859
Really? What'd you
drive here?

25:28.728 --> 25:29.729
How much you pay for that?

25:32.999 --> 25:34.967
EBilly..

25:35.001 --> 25:36.102
You don't know
anything about me.

25:38.838 --> 25:39.872
Great. It's Adam.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.176
BILLY: Who's Adam?

25:44.210 --> 25:46.045
They're from Wrightsville.
The team we're
playing tomorrow.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.749
Which one of
them's Adam?

25:49.782 --> 25:50.783
Both of them.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.988
Look who it is, Adam.
Nick Fadden.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.024
How's it going,
Adam? Adam.

26:00.793 --> 26:01.828
Wait. So, you guys are
both named Adam?

26:01.861 --> 26:04.864
What's your point?

26:04.897 --> 26:05.798
Oh, no point.
It's just a little
confusing, you know.

26:05.832 --> 26:08.000
For you, maybe.

26:08.034 --> 26:11.070
Nice.
So you're pitching tomorrow?

26:11.103 --> 26:13.005
Yeah. I'll be on the mound.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.907
Good. I'm looking forward
to a little batting practice.

26:14.941 --> 26:18.778
If you can remember,
I like my pitches inside.
About belt high.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.813
Yeah, we're in the
middle of a game here.

26:20.847 --> 26:21.814
So, I'll just see you guys
tomorrow, all right?

26:21.848 --> 26:25.017
Well, I've got an idea.
Why don't we all play?

26:25.051 --> 26:27.620
You and hair gel here
against me and Adam.

26:28.387 --> 26:31.023
Hair gel? Ouch.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.925
What do you say?
We could make it...

26:32.959 --> 26:34.093
Interesting?

26:36.128 --> 26:38.097
It's not really
my best sport.

26:39.799 --> 26:40.800
It's a game.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.038
All right.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.107
Now that I've finally
found a design that
I'm happy with,

26:48.140 --> 26:50.409
thanks to India,

26:50.442 --> 26:52.645
it's time to buckle down,
all right?

26:52.679 --> 26:55.147
I'm going to need ivory silk
charmeuse for the bodice,

26:55.181 --> 26:57.116
pearls for the sleeves,

26:57.149 --> 27:00.186
the absolute smallest
covered buttons you can find
to cover the zipper,

27:00.219 --> 27:03.656
and a French silk tulle,
in ecru.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.025
I repeat, ecru, not cream.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.660
He's back.

27:07.694 --> 27:10.062
Got it? Good.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.932
All right, people,
stand back!

27:12.965 --> 27:14.967
Doctor Jones is about
to make the first cut.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.807
Oh! That's game.

27:20.840 --> 27:24.877
Now, I would say rack 'em,
but I think you guys
are all out of money.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.013
There's an ATM outside,
though, if you want
to keep going.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.080
You think
you're funny?

27:28.114 --> 27:29.115
Generally? Yes.

27:30.717 --> 27:31.818
Hey, good game, guys.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.119
You hustled us.

27:33.152 --> 27:33.986
No, we didn't.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.757
Hey, Adam, relax!

27:37.790 --> 27:38.958
We want our money back.

27:38.991 --> 27:39.892
No way.

27:39.926 --> 27:43.696
Look, guys.
We won fair
and square.

27:43.730 --> 27:43.996
Nobody made you put
the money down.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.802
You're gonna give us
that money back.

27:51.470 --> 27:52.905
Really? I am?

27:52.939 --> 27:54.974
Yeah, you are.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.943
Actually, I think
I'm gonna keep it

27:56.976 --> 27:57.977
and split it with
my friend here.

27:58.010 --> 27:58.677
Friend?

27:58.711 --> 28:01.113
Now's really
not a good time.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.850
Give me the money.
Right now.

28:03.883 --> 28:04.483
Or what?

28:04.516 --> 28:04.984
(GRUNTS)

28:08.154 --> 28:09.856
Dude, are you okay?

28:09.889 --> 28:11.123
That kind of hurt.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.861
(GROANS)

28:14.894 --> 28:17.163
Seriously, dude!

28:17.196 --> 28:19.265
(GROANING)
Hit them. Not me.

28:19.298 --> 28:23.002
Okay. Hey, we can
take these guys.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.203
Okay. Let's do it.

28:29.508 --> 28:29.842
What?.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.211
It's Adam.

28:32.244 --> 28:33.312
Are you kidding me?
Another...

28:35.514 --> 28:36.315
What should we do?

28:46.893 --> 28:48.795
Hey, Jeremy.
I think I found the...

28:51.197 --> 28:53.165
Magnificent, isn't it?

28:53.199 --> 28:56.168
What do you think?

28:56.202 --> 28:57.970
Where did
you get this?

28:58.004 --> 29:02.775
I told you. From India.
Quite frankly, I'm surprised.

29:02.809 --> 29:05.277
I don't think she's
realized her true calling
in accessories design.

29:05.311 --> 29:06.712
Wouldn't you say?

29:06.745 --> 29:11.183
Charlotte Whitmore isn't
gonna know what hit her
when she sees this one.

29:11.217 --> 29:14.086
All that's left
is to be hemmed, sewn,
and embellished, and...

29:15.321 --> 29:17.256
Are you all right?

29:19.058 --> 29:20.893
No. I'm not.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.930
That design, it's...

29:25.197 --> 29:26.198
It's mine.

29:33.272 --> 29:33.372
This is yours?

29:35.574 --> 29:39.145
Yes. It's mine.
India took it.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.848
India?

29:41.881 --> 29:44.216
Honestly, Jane.
This is a serious thing.
If you accuse someone...

29:44.250 --> 29:45.251
Accuse someone
of what?

29:46.986 --> 29:48.587
Nothing. No one is...

29:48.620 --> 29:50.990
You! I'm accusing you.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.158
Me?

29:52.191 --> 29:54.060
Yeah, you took
my sketch.

29:54.093 --> 29:54.927
I did (SCOFFS)thing.

29:54.961 --> 29:57.897
You know what?
Maybe you're confused.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.198
Maybe this is just
a misunderstanding?

29:59.231 --> 29:59.999
Perhaps you sketched
something similar to this...

30:00.032 --> 30:02.835
LoOh, I think you are..

30:03.269 --> 30:05.071
India, stop.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.839
She's accusing me
and you defend her?

30:06.873 --> 30:09.108
I'm not defending
anyone, I just...

30:09.141 --> 30:10.609
You don't believe me?

30:10.642 --> 30:13.846
Yes. No. I...
I don't know who to believe.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.614
Well, I'm telling the truth.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.250
Prove it. Go on, Jane.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.252
Prove I took your sketch.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.421
I... I can't.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.327
You know,
when you cheat, India,
you only cheat yourself.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.996
What're you, 12?

30:30.029 --> 30:32.899
No, I'm...

30:32.932 --> 30:35.034
I'm not letting you
get away with this.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.237
That sketch is mine.
And I...

30:38.270 --> 30:39.872
No, it's mine.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.974
NIt's mine!

30:42.008 --> 30:43.609
Both of you,
stop it this instant!

30:43.642 --> 30:47.213
What's your problem?

30:47.246 --> 30:48.180
What've you got?

30:51.150 --> 30:51.984
Love it.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.022
That settles it.
This is the dress
we're making tonight.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.356
Whomever it belongs to.

31:08.467 --> 31:12.939
The Adams are still out there.
Man, that guy was huge.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.006
I can't believe
we're hiding.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.642
Yeah, I can't believe
you elbowed me in the eye.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.278
I'm sorry.
I was winding up
for a punch.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.213
Winding up?

31:21.247 --> 31:23.182
Yeah. It was going to be
a good one, too.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.450
Who winds up for a punch?

31:25.351 --> 31:28.687
Okay, small confession.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.923
I've never actually
been in a fight before.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.925
Yeah. I got that.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.293
Hey, you know, at least
you're not good at everything.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.131
So...

31:40.232 --> 31:43.335
Why was this so
important to Jane?

31:43.369 --> 31:46.005
You and me
hanging out tonight?

31:46.038 --> 31:49.075
I don't know. I think
she wants us to be
friends or something.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.310
I'll think about it.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.246
Dude, I was not
extending an offer there.

31:56.182 --> 31:59.185
But we do have more in common
than I initially thought.

31:59.218 --> 31:59.986
Yeah? Like what?

32:00.019 --> 32:01.487
We're both really
good at pool.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.521
You're not that good.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.325
Nachos?

32:06.358 --> 32:08.327
That works.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.529
All right.
Then there's
the obvious one.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.265
Jane.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.009
I don't know why
you're so worked up.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.511
I'm not worked up.
Not at all.

32:25.544 --> 32:28.514
(LAUGHS) I mean,
you know, the whole
creative integrity thing

32:28.547 --> 32:31.117
is way overrated
if you ask me.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.152
I don't have time
for this, Jane.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.420
In the end,
it doesn't matter
who gets the credit.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.255
It's Donovan's name
up there.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.257
You're right. I'm fine.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.993
This hem needs
to be basted.

32:41.027 --> 32:42.528
I'm on it.

32:42.561 --> 32:46.232
We need a fit model.
This form's all wrong.

32:46.265 --> 32:49.035
The hem's sagging,
the bodice is drooping.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.437
This is all
we have right now.
I could call someone...

32:51.470 --> 32:54.173
We don't have time
to call in a fit model.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.474
We just need someone
yay high.

33:00.346 --> 33:01.347
Seriously?

33:11.423 --> 33:13.392
It's gorgeous.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.468
This is my design.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.005
And I can prove it.

33:37.849 --> 33:41.087
I see it. Right here.
It's clearly yours.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.590
The ruching.
The detail.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.593
I didn't even know
it was my inspiration
at first.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.596
Not until I was wearing it.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.332
It was like she was
staring back at me
in the mirror.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.633
I'm so sorry
I doubted you, Jane.

33:55.501 --> 33:58.070
It's okay.

33:58.104 --> 34:00.339
No. It's not.
I should have known.

34:00.372 --> 34:04.143
How could you?
Honestly, it's okay.

34:04.176 --> 34:07.246
I'm just sorry
I got so angry.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.047
You had every right
to be angry about it.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.251
I can't believe
India would do this.

34:14.353 --> 34:15.587
Why would she do this?

34:15.621 --> 34:17.523
Why does India do anything?

34:21.560 --> 34:22.094
You know,
you look just like her.

34:24.463 --> 34:25.531
Yeah.

34:26.665 --> 34:27.133
Where is she now?

34:31.170 --> 34:32.171
I have no idea.

34:33.672 --> 34:36.842
Oh, I'm sorry, Jane.

34:36.875 --> 34:39.411
No.

34:39.445 --> 34:40.479
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

34:48.154 --> 34:48.887
It's settled.
We're telling Gray.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.458
Jane, this is serious.

34:52.491 --> 34:53.659
The only thing
that matters to me
is that you know.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.162
That you know it was mine.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.498
Now, let's finish it.

34:59.531 --> 35:03.402
* Here we go, slow

35:03.435 --> 35:05.904
* Back to the bottle

35:05.937 --> 35:09.475
* 'Cause what we don't know

35:09.508 --> 35:13.179
* No, it won't
cause a problem, no

35:13.212 --> 35:17.583
* And it's in the stars,
they say

35:17.616 --> 35:20.452
* So I keep my eyes
on the ground

35:20.486 --> 35:23.422
* Down, down

35:23.455 --> 35:27.559
* Down, down, down

35:27.593 --> 35:31.697
* All the world could be

35:31.730 --> 35:33.632
* Falling and crumbling down

35:33.665 --> 35:38.404
* It's all right with me

35:38.437 --> 35:40.639
* If it comes, let it fall

35:40.672 --> 35:45.311
* 'Cause I've got
everything I want

35:45.344 --> 35:46.712
* I've got

35:46.745 --> 35:49.281
* There's no time for concern

35:51.483 --> 35:54.586
* There's no time...

35:54.620 --> 35:56.288
Are you sure
you want to do this?

35:59.425 --> 36:01.260
I do.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.465
(SIGHS)

36:08.634 --> 36:10.202
Cheers.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.373
Thank you.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.208
You, too.

36:25.651 --> 36:26.652
Oh.

36:28.554 --> 36:29.221
Oh. Thank you.

36:29.255 --> 36:33.625
* I knew it from the start

36:33.659 --> 36:36.295
* You ran off with my heart

36:36.328 --> 36:40.399
* And with your first hello

36:40.432 --> 36:42.334
* I was forever yours

36:42.368 --> 36:43.435
You should tell her,
you know.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.637
Who?

36:45.671 --> 36:48.374
Gray. You should tell her
what India did

36:48.407 --> 36:50.409
and that she tried
to take the credit.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.810
I could. You're right.

36:54.446 --> 36:57.783
But bringing somebody down
just to get ahead,

36:57.816 --> 36:59.418
that's just not me.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.019
That's really, uh...

37:01.052 --> 37:04.690
Naive. (CHUCKLES) I know.

37:04.723 --> 37:08.527
No. Actually,
I was gonna say
that's really admirable.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.562
Which is not a word
we use a lot
in this business.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.332
Thank you, Carter.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.536
Are you gonna tell me
why you did it?

37:17.569 --> 37:18.036
Why does it matter?

37:18.069 --> 37:19.805
It matters to me.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.541
She's just some
ridiculous assistant

37:22.574 --> 37:25.611
that you and Gray
seem to heap your
attention on day after day.

37:25.644 --> 37:26.312
Yet you took her design.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.779
For me?.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.247
I mean, Donovan Decker.

37:33.519 --> 37:36.655
All I wanted was
for you, us,

37:36.688 --> 37:38.324
this company to succeed.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.828
You seemed so happy
when you saw the design,
and I just thought...

37:42.861 --> 37:44.330
You thought what?

37:45.731 --> 37:48.567
I thought it didn't matter
where it came from.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.868
Is tIt is.ght?

37:55.073 --> 37:56.808
India. You and I...

37:58.344 --> 37:59.311
It's over.

38:15.361 --> 38:19.097
* Give me a real solution

38:19.130 --> 38:22.401
* Give me a resolution

38:22.434 --> 38:28.774
* Give me a reason
not to look away

38:32.511 --> 38:35.581
Richard, hi. It's India.

38:36.615 --> 38:39.618
Yeah. Yes, I got the flowers,

38:40.886 --> 38:42.388
and they're beautiful.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.757
About your invitation
tonight, um,

38:49.395 --> 38:50.562
I'd love to have
dinner with you.

38:52.163 --> 38:52.531
All right.
I'll see you then.

38:54.833 --> 38:59.938
* What I mean to you

39:02.941 --> 39:06.912
* Give me a real solution

39:06.945 --> 39:09.681
* Give me a resolution

39:13.752 --> 39:15.421
Where do you think
you're going?

39:16.588 --> 39:17.889
Home. Same as you.

39:17.923 --> 39:20.859
Not quite.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.495
You have to wait with him
for Charlotte Whitmore.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.696
She'll be here in an hour.

39:25.564 --> 39:26.698
Why do I have to stay?

39:29.535 --> 39:32.804
You wanted the credit, Jane.
You got it.

39:32.838 --> 39:36.374
Are you really just
gonna leave Jeremy here
all alone to face the music?

39:38.477 --> 39:38.710
What if she doesn't like it?

39:51.723 --> 39:53.959
You mind
parking it for me?

39:53.992 --> 39:54.926
My pleasure.

39:58.530 --> 39:58.964
Yo, Nick!

39:58.997 --> 39:59.565
Yeah?

40:01.467 --> 40:03.702
Say hi to the Adams
for me, huh?

40:03.735 --> 40:04.670
I'(CHUCKLES).

40:10.476 --> 40:12.878
Come on, come on, come on.

40:14.913 --> 40:15.747
(SIGHS)

40:34.600 --> 40:34.733
(SIGHS)

40:39.237 --> 40:40.906
(DOOR OPENS)

40:44.510 --> 40:46.011
Charlotte! You're here.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.779
You have
exactly 10 minutes.

40:47.813 --> 40:49.681
I have an appointment
with Vera Wang
at 12:30 sharp.

40:49.715 --> 40:51.116
Vera Wang?

40:51.149 --> 40:54.753
Well, I don't have
a lot of confidence
in Donovan Decker right now.

40:54.786 --> 40:55.787
Right this way.

40:56.988 --> 40:59.224
Before I look,

40:59.257 --> 41:01.727
I'd like to know what
you think of the dress, Jane.

41:06.665 --> 41:07.733
I think you need
to see it.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.945
It's beautiful, isn't it?

41:34.325 --> 41:35.861
Oh, no. No, no, no...

41:37.863 --> 41:38.830
(SIGHS)

41:40.566 --> 41:40.732
This can't
be happening.

41:42.768 --> 41:44.770
Please don't say you hate it.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.938
You have no idea
how much work
went into this, and I...

41:46.972 --> 41:48.674
I love it.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.610
You love it?

41:51.643 --> 41:52.611
She loves it.

41:52.644 --> 41:56.314
It's exactly
what I wanted.
It's elegant.

41:56.347 --> 41:59.017
It's simple.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.085
And not fussy.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.087
(LAUGHS)
Definitely not fussy.

42:04.122 --> 42:05.991
(SIGHS) It's classic.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.028
I thought so, too.

42:11.730 --> 42:12.998
It's the one.

42:17.068 --> 42:22.941
* Outside the window
the sun is shining
all the time

42:22.974 --> 42:26.812
* Ooh, ooh,
I'm so sweet on you

42:29.615 --> 42:32.684
* You, ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh

42:32.718 --> 42:33.719
* One, two, three

42:33.752 --> 42:37.589
* You are all I need

42:37.623 --> 42:39.691
* You're sweet as sugar

42:39.725 --> 42:41.359
* Four, five, six

42:41.392 --> 42:43.962
* You gotta give me a kiss

42:43.995 --> 42:45.363
* You're sweet as sugar

42:45.396 --> 42:45.764
NICHi.Hey.

42:45.797 --> 42:48.333
YI made it..

42:48.366 --> 42:49.968
Perfect timing.

42:50.001 --> 42:51.569
I'm really sorry
about last night.

42:52.037 --> 42:53.071
Don't be.

42:54.640 --> 42:55.974
What happened
to your lip?

42:57.909 --> 43:01.146
Long story.
You should see Billy.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.080
You got into a fight
with Billy?

43:02.113 --> 43:04.650
Yeah,

43:04.683 --> 43:06.885
but don't worry,
we were on
the same side.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.720
Same side of what?

43:08.754 --> 43:13.759
Again, long story.
It was nothing.
Actually, it was...

43:13.792 --> 43:15.026
It was a weirdly
good night.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.394
Good.

43:16.427 --> 43:17.763
I'm just glad
you're here now.

43:17.796 --> 43:18.730
Me, too.

43:18.764 --> 43:22.400
* I'm so sweet on you

43:22.433 --> 43:23.935
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

43:23.969 --> 43:25.671
* You're sweet as sugar

43:25.704 --> 43:27.773
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

43:27.806 --> 43:29.808
* You're sweet as sugar

43:29.841 --> 43:31.042
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

43:31.076 --> 43:33.645
* You're sweet as sugar
