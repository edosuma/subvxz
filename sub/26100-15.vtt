00:01.566 --> 00:03.090
- Previously on
"God Friended Me"...

00:03.133 --> 00:04.656
- The diocese has decided
to send us

00:04.700 --> 00:06.223
a new assistant rector.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.095
His name's
Reverend Andrew Carver.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.922
Arthur's tenure here at
Harlem Episcopal

00:09.966 --> 00:11.402
might be coming to an end,

00:11.446 --> 00:13.622
and we think you would make
an excellent replacement.

00:13.665 --> 00:16.016
- So, who are we here to find?

00:16.059 --> 00:18.366
- Hi, I'm Fliss,
you must be Miles.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.368
- Can I have everybody's
attention?

00:20.411 --> 00:22.500
IdentitySeal has been sold.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.285
- To who?
- Simon Hayes.

00:24.328 --> 00:25.851
- I'm head of
Mobile App Design.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.984
- You have caught the attention
of Mr. Simon Hayes,

00:28.028 --> 00:30.073
and he has asked to meet
with you.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.470
- ♪ I'm calling you up

00:35.513 --> 00:37.124
♪ To see where you are

00:37.167 --> 00:39.822
- I can't believe Simon Hayes
wants to meet with me today.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.345
- You're gonna be great.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.565
- But what am I supposed to say
to a tech billionaire

00:43.608 --> 00:45.132
who might be behind
the God Account?

00:45.175 --> 00:47.960
And wait, what if he knows that
I've been fishing

00:48.004 --> 00:49.614
inside of his servers,
and he just wants to

00:49.658 --> 00:51.094
look me in the eye
before sending me off

00:51.138 --> 00:53.314
to, like, the IdentitySeal
office in Siberia?

00:53.357 --> 00:55.577
- Or, maybe he knows
that you're working

00:55.620 --> 00:56.882
on an important project,

00:56.926 --> 00:59.102
and he wants to
introduce himself.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.973
- Dude, I am on the phone.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.890
I wish you were coming
this weekend,

01:04.934 --> 01:06.196
'cause that way
you could've just come

01:06.240 --> 01:07.763
to the IdentitySeal mixer.

01:08.981 --> 01:10.983
- Ray, you should, uh,
you should get that.

01:11.027 --> 01:14.117
- Dude, I am on the phone,
and I don't even live here.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.119
- You're just gonna wanna
trust us.

01:16.163 --> 01:18.861
- Fine, whatever.
Jaya, I am sorry.

01:22.865 --> 01:24.388
- Surprise!

01:24.432 --> 01:28.044
- Ja--what are you doing here?

01:28.088 --> 01:30.916
- I couldn't risk you going to
a work mixer alone.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.135
I know how those get.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.838
- Oh.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.231
- Hmm.
- Okay.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.972
I'm suddenly feeling
very single.

01:43.015 --> 01:45.409
- Yeah, I would leave,
but this is my place.

01:46.889 --> 01:49.021
- Hey, guys.
- Welcome back.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.762
- Thank you for keeping it
a surprise.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.329
- Hey.

01:52.373 --> 01:55.854
He has been insufferable
the last six months.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.291
-  I have.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.075
- Oh, got a Friend Suggestion.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.598
- I can't believe I show up

02:00.642 --> 02:01.947
and you get
a Friend Suggestion.

02:01.991 --> 02:05.037
Just like old times.

02:05.081 --> 02:06.387
- "Vivian Hall."

02:06.430 --> 02:08.780
- Wait, Vivian Hall?
- Mm-hmm.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.521
- Yeah, I know her--well,
sort of.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.697
I wrote an article about her
and her fiancé, Aiden.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.090
- Great, then we have a way in.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.440
It should be easy to figure out
what her problem is.

02:16.484 --> 02:20.314
-  I know what
her problem is.

02:20.357 --> 02:23.230
Vivian's in a coma.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.974
Vivian and Aiden were set
to get married ten months ago,

02:29.018 --> 02:30.193
but on the morning
of the wedding

02:30.237 --> 02:32.456
she had a brain aneurysm.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.849
They never made it down
the aisle,

02:33.892 --> 02:35.807
and he's been waiting on her
to wake up ever since.

02:35.851 --> 02:40.334
- No offense, but that's, like,
a really depressing article.

02:40.377 --> 02:44.251
Or a beautiful, if tragic,
story of love and hope.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.558
- Well, maybe this is about
the fiancé.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.386
- Well, Vivian's at
University General.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.519
I know Aiden went down there on
his lunch breaks all the time.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.651
Maybe we could catch him.
- Yeah.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.567
- You guys mind taking
this one yourselves?

02:56.611 --> 02:58.830
- No problem. I'm sure
you guys wanna catch up.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.748
- Oh-ho-ho, not here.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.663
Mm-mm, they ain't "catching"
up here.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.150
- Hey, Ali,
I'm Andrew Carver.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.847
We met after Sunday Service
last week.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.675
- Of course, Reverend Carver,
nice to see you again.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.764
- I hear you make one of
the best cups of coffee

03:19.808 --> 03:21.070
in New York City.

03:21.113 --> 03:23.246
- You came all the way
down here, to a bar,

03:23.290 --> 03:24.378
for a cup of coffee?

03:24.421 --> 03:26.249
- Not buying it, huh?
- No.

03:26.293 --> 03:29.948
Let me guess, this has
something to do with my father?

03:29.992 --> 03:31.863
- Let's just say I'm having
trouble cracking

03:31.907 --> 03:33.822
the impenetrable Arthur Finer,

03:33.865 --> 03:35.737
and I hear you're an expert
on the subject.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.869
- Yeah, he takes a little while
to warm up.

03:37.913 --> 03:40.394
- Plus, my enthusiasm to share
some of my ideas

03:40.437 --> 03:42.657
about modernizing things
did not go over well.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.267
- He's just being protective.

03:44.311 --> 03:47.270
Harlem Episcopal is like
his third child.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.663
- I understand.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.317
I was supposed to lead
the 3:00 p.m. service today,

03:50.360 --> 03:53.537
but Arthur changed his mind
at the last minute.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.322
- Have you thought
about asking him

03:55.365 --> 03:57.280
for his advice
on one of your sermons?

03:57.324 --> 03:58.542
- I know how to write a sermon.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.762
- Not at his church.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.720
Let him know he has a voice

04:02.764 --> 04:04.592
in what his congregation's
gonna hear.

04:04.635 --> 04:07.116
Not to mention he always
likes an idea better

04:07.159 --> 04:09.553
when he thinks it's his.

04:11.338 --> 04:14.602
- So, my internship at
the Mayo Clinic is almost up,

04:14.645 --> 04:16.821
and I've been offered

04:16.865 --> 04:19.998
an amazing opportunity
to do my residency.

04:20.042 --> 04:23.915
- Residency, isn't that
like...like three years?

04:23.959 --> 04:26.266
- Yeah, but it's gonna--
- Wait, Jaya.

04:26.309 --> 04:29.007
Did you come all the way back
here just to break up with me?

04:29.051 --> 04:32.446
- Rakesh,
the hospital's here...

04:32.489 --> 04:35.623
in New York,
and I'm taking the job.

04:35.666 --> 04:36.928
- You're serious?

04:39.017 --> 04:42.194
Oh, this is the best day
of my life.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.413
Oh, my God,
we need to celebrate.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.589
I'ma take you to
the fanciest lunch in town.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.853
- Rakesh.
- Fanciest lunch I can afford.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.899
- Aren't you forgetting
something?

04:50.942 --> 04:54.119
Your meeting with Simon Hayes,
which starts pretty soon.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.556
- Right.
New plan.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.688
Fanciest dinner
I can afford.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.037
- Sounds perfect.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.344
That's for luck.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.655
- You think Aiden is still
visiting her every day?

05:07.698 --> 05:09.134
I mean, it's been ten months.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.440
- Well, he never left
Vivian's side

05:10.484 --> 05:12.007
for the few weeks I was
writing the article.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.705
- Few weeks? I've seen you
crank out an article overnight.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.360
- Yeah, but Vivian and Aiden's
love story came with a mystery.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.405
- Mm-hmm?

05:18.448 --> 05:19.710
- Like, the night
before the wedding,

05:19.754 --> 05:21.233
she left the rehearsal dinner
early saying

05:21.277 --> 05:23.497
she was tired and going to bed.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.716
Which is where Aiden
thought she was

05:25.760 --> 05:27.805
until the next morning
she showed up at the hotel

05:27.849 --> 05:29.807
wearing the same clothes
from the night before.

05:29.851 --> 05:30.939
- Where was she?

05:30.982 --> 05:32.462
- Well, that's the thing,
no one knows.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.029
She entered the lobby,

05:34.072 --> 05:35.596
had a conversation with
the doorman, who said

05:35.639 --> 05:37.424
she seemed in good spirits,
and then when she was walking

05:37.467 --> 05:38.903
to the elevator,
she collapsed.

05:38.947 --> 05:40.905
- Well, maybe the God Account
wants us to solve it.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.559
- I covered all the bases
when I investigated it

05:42.603 --> 05:43.778
ten months ago.

05:43.821 --> 05:46.128
Besides, it's not like we can
just ask her.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.965
- Right?

05:57.008 --> 05:58.967
- Maybe we can.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.975
- Hi, Aiden.
- Cara.

06:07.018 --> 06:09.151
I can't believe it.
What a great surprise.

06:09.194 --> 06:12.415
Viv, this is Cara Bloom.
She wrote the article about us.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.548
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Oh, you too.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.941
I read the story you wrote,
it was lovely.

06:16.985 --> 06:18.073
- Thank you.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.031
This is my friend, Miles.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.163
- Nice to meet you.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.208
- Cara has told me all about
you two.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.949
- So, when did you wake up?

06:24.993 --> 06:26.081
- Three weeks ago.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.648
- Viv's made
an incredible recovery.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.650
She's actually being discharged
tomorrow.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.695
Are you here to write
a follow-up?

06:31.739 --> 06:35.003
- Uh...yeah.
Yeah, I am.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.526
- Everyone loves
a happy ending.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.963
- Not to mention
a great mystery.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.488
I am dying to know
what happened that night.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.054
- Actually,
Vivian doesn't remember

06:43.098 --> 06:44.316
a thing from that night.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.057
The doctor said memory loss
is common,

06:46.101 --> 06:47.755
especially the hours
leading up to the coma.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.452
- Any chance you'll
get it back?

06:49.496 --> 06:51.715
- They don't know.
- I'm so sorry.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.500
It must be frustrating
not knowing what happened.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.763
- Honestly, I'm just happy
to be alive.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.505
- Vivian struggled with it.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.158
- I don't need to know
what happened.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.030
I already lost six months
of my life.

07:02.073 --> 07:04.641
I just wanna move on,
start our life together.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.687
- And we will, I promise.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.603
- Maybe there's something that
we can do to help.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.301
- You know what?
I think there is.

07:12.344 --> 07:13.345
Um...

07:20.265 --> 07:21.832
I found this in Viv's purse

07:21.876 --> 07:23.486
three weeks after
you wrote the article.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.096
Wasn't sure what it was,
and at the time,

07:25.140 --> 07:26.924
I didn't really care.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.883
- It looks like some kind of
claim chip.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.406
- So, you don't recognize it?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.625
- No.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.191
- Which means you probably
got it that night.

07:33.235 --> 07:34.541
It's a start.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.064
- Really, I don't wanna waste
your guys' time.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.501
- Viv, come on, I know this
has been bugging you.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.547
How could it not?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.462
Let's just try to fill in
the blanks,

07:42.505 --> 07:45.247
put that night behind you
and move forward.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.254
So what do you say?

07:52.297 --> 07:53.473
Will you guys help us
figure out

07:53.516 --> 07:55.170
what happened that night?

07:55.213 --> 07:56.476
- Absolutely.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.523
- Rakesh?

08:00.567 --> 08:02.830
How you doing?
Simon Hayes.

08:02.873 --> 08:03.961
Pleasure to meet you, man.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.963
- Yes, sir, a pleasure.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.183
I mean, you meeting me--me
meeting you,

08:08.226 --> 08:09.576
not you meeting me.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.882
- Sorry. Little nervous.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.275
- Oh, come on, don't be.

08:13.318 --> 08:16.408
Ignore the suit,
I'm just a coder at heart.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.846
Investors like CEOs that
look like CEOS,

08:18.889 --> 08:20.978
you know what I mean?

08:21.022 --> 08:24.155
- Been a fan of your coding
for a really long time.

08:24.199 --> 08:28.464
Especially the early work,
it was...stunning.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.639
- Thanks, I appreciate that.

08:29.683 --> 08:32.337
I'm a fan of your skills,
you know?

08:32.381 --> 08:34.731
In fact, your coding reminds me
of an old pal of mine,

08:34.775 --> 08:35.993
one of the best I ever knew.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.735
- Oh, yeah?
Who's that?

08:38.779 --> 08:39.867
- You wouldn't have heard
of him.

08:39.910 --> 08:40.998
His name was Henry Chase.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.392
He was an old college buddy.
- Hmm.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.176
Is this the same Henry Chase

08:45.220 --> 08:48.092
you won the Everett Award
with at Columbia

08:48.136 --> 08:50.530
with someone named
Pria Amar, right?

08:50.573 --> 08:51.748
- Hmm.

08:53.010 --> 08:56.231
That's fun--you do
your homework, I like that.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.059
- Yeah.
- I like it.

08:58.102 --> 09:01.105
- So, uh, so--so,
what happened to him?

09:04.152 --> 09:07.198
We lost touch, yeah,
a long time ago.

09:07.242 --> 09:11.594
We set out to, uh,
to save the world,

09:11.638 --> 09:15.685
and the world fought back,
which it so often likes to do.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.601
Um, but I'm not done fighting.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.169
In fact, that's why I wanted
to meet you.

09:21.212 --> 09:24.346
I'm working on something...

09:24.389 --> 09:28.480
Something I think could be
pretty revolutionary.

09:29.699 --> 09:30.918
- What?

09:30.961 --> 09:34.269
- I can't tell you--I mean,
not yet, anyway.

09:34.312 --> 09:35.705
What I can tell you is that

09:35.749 --> 09:37.315
it's just gone through
a trial phase,

09:37.359 --> 09:39.927
and we're about ready to do
a beta launch

09:39.970 --> 09:41.406
and that's where you come in.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.321
- Me?
- Yeah.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.759
Your initial algorithms
for the mobile application

09:45.802 --> 09:47.630
were really good.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.285
And your
extracurricular activities

09:50.328 --> 09:51.416
around here the past few months

09:51.460 --> 09:53.723
demonstrate you're clearly
resourceful.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.030
- I'm sorry about that.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.598
- Don't be sorry, that's why
you're sitting here, man.

09:58.641 --> 10:01.209
Seriously, I've been looking
for someone like you, Rakesh.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.124
I really...yeah.

10:03.167 --> 10:07.824
Someone who could help me
oversee this launch,

10:07.868 --> 10:09.870
kinda be my right hand.

10:11.523 --> 10:14.135
What do you say?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.882
- And she doesn't remember
anything from that night?

10:21.925 --> 10:23.710
- Nothing after
the rehearsal dinner.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.842
- Yeah, that's common
with cases like that.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.453
If the memories do come back,
it's usually in pieces

10:28.497 --> 10:30.673
and even then,
people often feel disconnected

10:30.717 --> 10:32.762
from them, emotionally.
- I don't know.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.199
I mean, it felt like more than
that with Vivian.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.332
It felt like she didn't want
to remember what happened.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.768
- But why wouldn't she want
to remember?

10:38.812 --> 10:40.901
- It's a good question.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.946
- So, how are you gonna
figure out

10:42.990 --> 10:44.208
where she was that night?

10:44.252 --> 10:47.429
- Hopefully with this.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.170
- What is it?
- It's a claim chip.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.389
Hopefully, Rakesh can do
his image-matching thing

10:51.433 --> 10:53.261
and figure out where it's from.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.830
- I never took you for
a speakeasy guy, Miles.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.483
- What are you talking about?

10:58.527 --> 11:01.791
- That's a coat-check chip from
a place called Josephine's.

11:04.707 --> 11:07.362
- How did you know that?
- I'm in the bar business.

11:07.405 --> 11:09.799
Plus, my friend used to manage
the place.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.454
- Wait, why would Vivian go to
a speakeasy

11:12.497 --> 11:14.586
the night before her wedding?
- Let's find out.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.678
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.680
How did your meeting
with Simon Hayes go?

11:20.723 --> 11:23.030
Did he confess to being
behind the God Account?

11:23.073 --> 11:25.380
- Not in so many words.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.078
- What do you mean?

11:28.122 --> 11:29.819
- Well, he told me he's been
in trials

11:29.863 --> 11:32.735
on a top secret project.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.868
- Do you think these
top secret trials

11:34.911 --> 11:36.130
could be the God Account?

11:36.173 --> 11:37.305
- No idea.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.524
When I tried to press,
he, uh...

11:39.568 --> 11:42.136
he offered me a job
to oversee the project.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.746
- Come on, that's amazing, man.

11:43.790 --> 11:47.054
- Congrats.
- I'm so proud of you.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.099
- Uh...

11:49.143 --> 11:52.146
Job's in Palo Alto.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.888
- Wait, you're moving?
- No, I mean...

11:54.931 --> 11:57.020
He told me to think about it.
It just happened.

11:57.064 --> 12:00.284
All I know is I'm freaking out.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.811
- Go.
I got this.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.774
Hey, why are you freaking out?

12:11.818 --> 12:13.863
This is a good thing.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.953
- Because the job's in
Palo Alto, I'm here.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.738
We are here.

12:18.781 --> 12:22.132
- I get it.
The timing really sucks.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.700
But Rakesh, I can't be
the reason why you say no.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.223
- Why not?

12:26.267 --> 12:29.400
- Because that wouldn't
be fair to either of us.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.582
- Uh, this is it.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.460
- Can I help you guys?

12:45.503 --> 12:47.418
- Yeah, we're looking
for Josephine's.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.377
- Oh, through this door here.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.815
- Thank you.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.386
- ♪ Oh, me, oh, my

12:59.953 --> 13:02.129
♪ Oh, me, oh, my

13:02.172 --> 13:05.219
- Excuse me, could you help me?

13:05.262 --> 13:06.437
- This from last night?

13:06.481 --> 13:08.483
- Actually, it's from
ten months ago.

13:08.526 --> 13:09.789
Do you mind taking a look,

13:09.832 --> 13:11.486
seeing if it's in
the lost and found?

13:11.529 --> 13:13.488
- Can't promise anything.
- All right.

13:15.359 --> 13:18.058
You don't accidentally wander
into here for a drink.

13:18.101 --> 13:20.408
You have to know this place
exists to be able to find it.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.105
Which means it wasn't random

13:22.149 --> 13:23.846
that Vivian ended up here
that night.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.457
- Look, if I had an entire
night of my life missing,

13:26.501 --> 13:28.024
I would wanna know
what happened.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.853
I would have to know.
- But Vivian doesn't.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.073
- It's your lucky day.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.857
- Thank you.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.120
- Gonna check the pockets?

13:48.436 --> 13:50.525
Who's Noah?

13:53.310 --> 13:54.790
- It was in the pocket
of the jacket

13:54.834 --> 13:56.313
you were wearing that night.

13:56.357 --> 13:59.534
You left it at a bar called
Josephine's.

13:59.577 --> 14:02.276
- Oh, I knew this was
a mistake.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.887
I should have never let
you guys look into this.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.846
- You remember what happened,
don't you?

14:14.114 --> 14:17.160
- I think that I...

14:17.204 --> 14:19.946
I might have fallen in love
with someone that night.

14:30.391 --> 14:31.479
- When I first woke up,

14:31.522 --> 14:34.047
everything from that night
was a blank.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.352
But then after a few days,

14:35.396 --> 14:37.311
I started to remember
some things,

14:37.354 --> 14:39.052
just bits and pieces.

14:39.095 --> 14:42.533
Like, images, really...

14:42.577 --> 14:44.840
Feelings, like, from a dream.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.887
I don't remember how
we started talking,

14:47.930 --> 14:50.106
but I remember we ended up
at this Thai place

14:50.150 --> 14:54.545
that he said was his favorite
and then the speakeasy.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.247
That's all I remember.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.685
- Look, Vivian, feeling like
you fell in love with someone

15:03.728 --> 15:05.992
doesn't mean that you did.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.646
He might have just been someone
that you met and that was it.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.997
- Yeah, I've been trying to
convince myself of that,

15:11.040 --> 15:13.564
and maybe I could,
except for one thing.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.958
I know why I left
the rehearsal dinner early,

15:16.002 --> 15:18.178
and it wasn't because
I was tired.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.270
I was having cold feet.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.273
- Did Aiden know?

15:28.579 --> 15:30.451
- No, of course not.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.192
But I thought that if I could
just take a walk

15:32.235 --> 15:34.281
and clear my head,
that the feeling would go away.

15:34.324 --> 15:37.066
- But instead, you met someone.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.460
That's why you lied about

15:39.503 --> 15:41.636
not being able to remember
anything,

15:41.679 --> 15:44.291
to protect Aiden
from the truth.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.858
- He waited ten months for me
to wake up,

15:46.902 --> 15:50.340
he deserves the life
we were supposed to have.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.995
But how can I marry Aiden
when I know what I did?

15:53.039 --> 15:55.128
- Yeah, but you don't know
what you did.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.217
And until you do,
how can you make a decision

15:57.260 --> 15:59.045
for you or for Aiden?

16:03.136 --> 16:05.007
Even if I wanted to find Noah,

16:05.051 --> 16:06.704
I don't even know
his last name.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.880
- Well, we have his favorite
Thai restaurant.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.839
It's a start.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.016
Figuring out what really
happened that night

16:14.060 --> 16:15.800
is all we're talking about.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.546
- Okay.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.506
I'll go get my coat.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.948
Oh, shoot, I have my follow-up
interview with Aiden.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.820
- So, what are you gonna
tell him?

16:35.864 --> 16:39.302
- Well, there's nothing
to tell.

16:39.346 --> 16:42.392
- His fiancé met someone
the night before their wedding,

16:42.436 --> 16:45.439
who she thinks she may be
in love with.

16:45.482 --> 16:47.528
You seem determined for her
to find him.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.051
- Well,
she's our Friend Suggestion,

16:49.095 --> 16:50.313
we have to help her.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.880
- So, what about the guy
who stood by her side

16:51.923 --> 16:53.273
for ten months?

16:53.316 --> 16:55.057
Does he just lose out
because she met

16:55.101 --> 16:56.667
some random guy on the street?

16:56.711 --> 16:59.801
- No, it's not that simple.
- Okay, then explain it to me.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.933
- I know what
she's going through.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.196
Okay?

17:03.239 --> 17:05.546
I went through it with Eli.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.287
You think she wants to be

17:07.330 --> 17:08.897
having these feelings,
these doubts?

17:08.940 --> 17:10.420
You don't think she wants
to feel the same way

17:10.464 --> 17:13.336
that he does about her?

17:13.380 --> 17:16.644
Yeah, it sucks,

17:16.687 --> 17:20.517
but it's not her fault, Miles.

17:20.561 --> 17:21.823
She needs to know
what happened.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.651
They both do.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.176
- Andrew, come on in.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.786
- Sorry I'm late.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.658
I was talking to Lester,
he sends his hello.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.616
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.271
Just wanted to check in,
see how I'm doing.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.404
So, how am I doing?

17:37.447 --> 17:39.797
- Just finished reading
your sermon.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.103
- Oh, great.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.626
Any thoughts you have
I'd be happy to try to

17:42.670 --> 17:45.673
incorporate them before sharing
it with the...congregation.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.504
Those are a lot of thoughts.

17:50.547 --> 17:54.464
- Yeah, but this is part
of the process.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.423
Why don't you read
through my notes.

17:56.466 --> 17:59.208
We can discuss them
in detail later.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.644
Sound good?

18:00.688 --> 18:02.603
- Sure.

18:02.646 --> 18:05.127
- Look, it's a good start.

18:05.171 --> 18:08.957
And once I feel--once we feel
that it's ready,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.177
then we can talk
about when you might

18:11.220 --> 18:12.613
deliver it to the congregation.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.138
- I'll get to work on it
right away.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.748
Thanks.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.106
- Viv?

18:46.212 --> 18:49.911
- You think I'm a terrible
person, don't you?

18:49.954 --> 18:52.914
- No, no.

18:52.957 --> 18:55.569
- Well, that makes one of us.

18:55.612 --> 18:58.659
- Look, Vivian, you're not
a terrible person, okay?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.617
It's just...

19:00.661 --> 19:02.315
I've been that guy
standing there

19:02.358 --> 19:04.795
when someone else swoops in.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.015
You know,
I know how that feels.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.973
- I'm sorry.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.198
Aiden and I met
my freshman year at Rutgers.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.200
And then after graduation,

19:18.244 --> 19:20.159
we moved to New York,
and we got engaged.

19:20.202 --> 19:24.119
And like, just everything
seemed to move so fast with us.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.078
And then the night
before the wedding it was like

19:27.122 --> 19:29.646
time finally slowed down.

19:31.126 --> 19:32.736
And I panicked.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.913
- Well, that can happen
when you're thinking

19:35.957 --> 19:38.089
about the rest of your life.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.917
- Can I ask you something?

19:39.961 --> 19:41.528
- Yeah.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.400
- Do you believe in soul mates?

19:46.054 --> 19:49.623
You sound like Cara.
But no, I believe in love.

19:49.666 --> 19:52.974
Soul mates, it feels too easy,
like we're supposed to just

19:53.017 --> 19:55.150
sit back and wait
for something to happen.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.021
No, love is more than that.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.198
It's a collection
of shared experiences

19:59.241 --> 20:01.461
that lets you know
they're the one.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.419
Hey, there it is.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.334
- So what do we do now?

20:05.378 --> 20:07.423
- Well, I mean,
this is New York.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.033
So, if this is
his favorite spot,

20:09.077 --> 20:10.513
then he definitely orders
takeout,

20:10.557 --> 20:13.081
which means they will have
his address on file.

20:13.124 --> 20:14.256
- They're not just gonna
give us

20:14.300 --> 20:15.649
a customer's address.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.216
- All right.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.006
- Hello?
Hi, this is Noah.

20:25.049 --> 20:28.357
Yeah, yeah. Can I get
an order delivered, please?

20:28.401 --> 20:30.403
Yeah, yeah, the usual.
All right, thanks.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.405
So now, we wait
for the delivery person

20:32.448 --> 20:35.625
to walk out and follow them
straight to Noah.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.195
- Hey, thanks for coming down.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.631
- No problem.

20:41.675 --> 20:44.547
So, have you guys figured
anything out about that night?

20:44.591 --> 20:46.506
- Uh, nothing concrete.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.856
- Can I ask you something?

20:48.899 --> 20:51.075
Did you meet up with Vivian
today?

20:51.119 --> 20:52.251
- Yeah.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.340
Yeah, just to follow up
on a few things.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.691
Are you okay?

20:57.734 --> 20:59.823
- I don't know, you tell me.

20:59.867 --> 21:03.174
I went by the apartment today
to check on Viv.

21:03.218 --> 21:06.134
She wasn't there,
but I...

21:06.177 --> 21:09.877
I found this...
on the table.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.968
Did she meet someone
that night?

21:15.926 --> 21:18.277
That's why she was so hesitant
about looking into it.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.887
- Hey, look, she doesn't know
what happened.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.367
- She has some other guy's
number,

21:21.410 --> 21:23.804
obviously something happened.

21:23.847 --> 21:26.110
I knew that something was wrong
when she left

21:26.154 --> 21:27.547
the rehearsal dinner and that,
you know,

21:27.590 --> 21:29.375
maybe she was even having
second thoughts.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.464
- Why didn't you say anything?
- You don't know Viv.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.640
She second guesses everything.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.860
The only thing she ever
answered quickly was

21:36.904 --> 21:39.689
when she said yes
after I proposed.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.735
When she left
the rehearsal dinner early,

21:41.778 --> 21:44.955
I thought that that was just
Vivian being Vivian.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.696
You know, that she needed to
think it all through

21:46.740 --> 21:48.742
one last time,
but now that I know

21:48.785 --> 21:50.091
she was with someone else,

21:50.134 --> 21:51.397
obviously it was more than
cold feet.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.442
- No, Aiden you need to talk
to her.

21:53.486 --> 21:57.533
- No, I can't, not now.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.066
- Don't they usually have,
like,

22:09.110 --> 22:11.373
a ten-block radius
on deliveries?

22:11.417 --> 22:12.679
- Here we go.

22:12.722 --> 22:13.984
Uh, excuse me, sir.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.725
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.554
Uh, Very Thai?
- Uh-huh.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.600
- Is that for Noah?
- Yeah.

22:20.643 --> 22:24.299
- Oh, we live across the hall.
We can take it up to him.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.649
- Okay.
Oh.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.434
- Five.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.094
All right, here it is.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.753
You okay?
- Not even a little bit.

22:43.797 --> 22:46.495
I have no idea how I'm gonna
feel when he opens that door

22:46.539 --> 22:48.279
or how he's gonna feel
about me.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.893
But I have to find out.

23:05.775 --> 23:10.040
- He's not there.
He moved out a few weeks ago.

23:12.347 --> 23:15.437
Miles?
- Fliss?

23:17.352 --> 23:19.441
Are you a delivery guy now?

23:27.971 --> 23:31.322
- It is so good to see you,
Miles.

23:31.366 --> 23:32.628
How is Cara?

23:32.672 --> 23:34.325
- Aw, she's great.
I'll tell her you said hi.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.718
Oh, this is Vivian.

23:35.762 --> 23:38.242
- Hi, Fliss.
- Hi.

23:38.286 --> 23:41.028
So, you said Noah moved?
Do you know where?

23:41.071 --> 23:44.640
- Oh, sorry, no.
Um, why?

23:44.684 --> 23:46.337
- It's a long story.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.818
- Oh, I love long stories.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.693
- Uh...

23:53.736 --> 23:57.740
Well, I met Noah
ten months ago.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.438
And I only knew him
for one night,

23:59.481 --> 24:02.615
but I really need to find him.

24:02.658 --> 24:04.007
- Say no more.

24:04.051 --> 24:06.140
You think Noah is
your soul mate,

24:06.183 --> 24:09.926
and Miles is gonna help you
find him.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.580
I know that look.

24:11.624 --> 24:15.018
I had that look the last time
that I was with Miles and Cara.

24:15.062 --> 24:17.760
And while I have not yet
found my soul mate,

24:17.804 --> 24:19.806
fingers crossed.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.416
- Right.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.985
Well, I don't really know
if Noah's my soul mate.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.596
Is there anything that you
could tell us about him?

24:27.640 --> 24:30.077
- Well, he's easy on the eyes,
that's for sure,

24:30.120 --> 24:32.645
but you already know that.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.517
I don't know his last name,
but I do know

24:35.561 --> 24:38.825
that he was a photographer,
and I think someone mentioned

24:38.868 --> 24:42.089
that he was moving out to open
his own studio.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.181
- Yeah, he was a photographer,
that's right.

24:47.224 --> 24:49.488
He took my picture that night.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.753
Yeah, we were in Central Park,
and the sun was just coming up,

24:53.796 --> 24:56.538
and I remember when he took
my photo I felt like...

24:56.582 --> 24:58.801
- What?

24:58.845 --> 25:00.934
- Truly happy.

25:07.897 --> 25:10.900
- Could I have decided to leave
Aiden that night?

25:13.120 --> 25:15.122
- There's an Aiden?
Who's Aiden?

25:15.165 --> 25:16.427
- My fiancé.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.952
- Oh.
Oh.

25:18.995 --> 25:22.259
- Listen, if Noah's opened
his own shop,

25:22.303 --> 25:23.913
then maybe we can
track him down.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.612
Oh, it's Cara.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.614
Hey, Cara, you're never gonna
guess who I'm with.

25:28.657 --> 25:31.747
- Miles, listen to me.
Aiden knows about Noah.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.228
Just meet me at Honeysuckle,
I'll explain everything.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.969
- Yeah, we'll meet you there.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.318
- What--what is it?

25:37.361 --> 25:39.668
- I think you need to call
Aiden.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.151
- Finished the second draft
already?

25:44.194 --> 25:45.369
- I did.
- Great.

25:45.413 --> 25:47.937
Just, um, leave it on the desk,

25:47.981 --> 25:50.113
and I'll look at it
this afternoon.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.854
- More notes?

25:53.290 --> 25:55.031
- If need be.

25:55.075 --> 25:57.468
This is my church,
and I need to make sure

25:57.512 --> 25:58.992
that things are done my way.

25:59.035 --> 26:01.037
- With all due respect,
that's not why I came here.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.048
- You know how much
I respect you, Arthur,

26:12.092 --> 26:14.703
respect this church.

26:14.747 --> 26:18.620
But I have my own voice,
my own message to share.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.275
And I believe if you let me,
I have something to offer.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.626
Something that will resonate
with those open to hear it,

26:24.670 --> 26:26.019
but I need to do it my way.

26:26.062 --> 26:30.589
And I need you to trust
that I can learn from you

26:30.632 --> 26:32.460
without having to emulate you.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.378
- Finished?
- Yes.

26:41.469 --> 26:44.428
- Good, because I agree.

26:44.472 --> 26:47.170
When I first came to
Harlem Episcopal,

26:47.214 --> 26:49.564
I had a difficult relationship
with the head priest.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.088
He would push me day in
and day out to do things

26:52.132 --> 26:53.829
the way he wanted.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.657
It wasn't until I spoke up
for myself

26:55.701 --> 26:58.399
and showed him that I had
confidence in my own voice,

26:58.442 --> 27:00.314
that he let me use it.

27:00.357 --> 27:02.664
As you just have.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.144
- What are you saying?

27:04.187 --> 27:06.668
- I'm saying that it's time
for this congregation

27:06.712 --> 27:08.931
to hear your sermon
this Sunday,

27:08.975 --> 27:12.369
prime time, and as it was.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.894
You're right, my job is not
to mold you

27:14.937 --> 27:17.244
into some version of me.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.768
My job is to give you
the courage and confidence

27:19.812 --> 27:21.640
to be who God wants you to be.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.686
- Well, so this whole thing
was a test?

27:26.296 --> 27:27.689
- Your words, not mine.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.998
Thank you, Arthur.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.826
And for the record,

27:33.869 --> 27:35.131
becoming a version of you

27:35.175 --> 27:37.177
would be a very high bar
to clear.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.406
- That's like the fifth
phone call she's made to Aiden.

27:49.450 --> 27:50.799
What do you think
she's gonna do?

27:50.843 --> 27:52.322
- I don't know.
- Well, we need to find

27:52.366 --> 27:54.150
Noah's studio
before she gets through to him.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.499
- Fliss, have you ever typed

27:55.543 --> 27:58.328
"photography studio
in Manhattan" into Google?

28:00.374 --> 28:03.246
- You know, with, um,
all this talk of soul mates,

28:03.290 --> 28:07.207
I was just wondering
if you and Cara have, uh...

28:07.250 --> 28:09.557
if you're still friends.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.428
- Yes, we are still friends.

28:11.472 --> 28:14.475
- Great, that's great.

28:14.518 --> 28:15.955
You mind me asking why?

28:15.998 --> 28:17.696
It's just--I mean...

28:17.739 --> 28:19.610
For someone who finds himself
cruising around the city

28:19.654 --> 28:20.742
helping people find love,

28:20.786 --> 28:22.178
you seem to have a bit
of a blind spot.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.658
- I don't have a blind spot.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.878
- Have you even thought
about asking her out?

28:27.662 --> 28:29.142
- As a matter of fact,
almost did.

28:29.185 --> 28:30.447
- Really?

28:30.491 --> 28:32.145
- Yeah, the night we reunited
you with Beaker,

28:32.188 --> 28:35.191
we were walking home
and her ex-boyfriend walked by,

28:35.235 --> 28:37.498
and let's just say
the moment was ruined.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.065
- I imagine it would be, yeah.

28:39.108 --> 28:41.154
- They started dating again
soon after.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.591
- Oh.
I am so sorry.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.201
I didn't know she was seeing
someone.

28:45.245 --> 28:46.942
I'll just--you know...

28:46.986 --> 28:49.815
- No, it's fine.
They broke up.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.121
- She's single?
- Yeah.

28:52.165 --> 28:54.341
- And lookee here.

28:54.384 --> 28:57.300
- Right when I came back
into your life.

28:57.344 --> 28:59.781
I think that this is
the universe

28:59.825 --> 29:01.565
reminding you of that night.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.439
Oh, Cara.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.920
- Fliss.
- Hi.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.922
- It's so good to see you.

29:09.965 --> 29:12.663
You're like a full-fledged
New Yorker now.

29:12.707 --> 29:13.926
- Thank you.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.362
I yelled at a cab
the other day,

29:15.405 --> 29:16.798
and it felt totally normal.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.284
You didn't get ahold of Aiden?
- No.

29:24.327 --> 29:27.809
I tried his cell, his work,
I left messages with friends.

29:27.853 --> 29:31.726
Don't think he wants to hear
from me, not that I blame him.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.728
- I'm sorry he found out
like that.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.469
- No, it's not your fault.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.819
I should have been honest
with him from the start.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.866
Aiden really deserves to be
with someone

29:40.909 --> 29:43.825
who sees how amazing he is.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.175
That's exactly what
I'm gonna tell him,

29:46.219 --> 29:47.524
soon as he lets me.

29:47.568 --> 29:51.398
- Um...I found Noah.

29:53.922 --> 29:56.882
- That's him,
I can't believe it.

30:00.407 --> 30:02.844
I don't think I can do this.

30:02.888 --> 30:06.413
- Hey, yes you can.

30:06.456 --> 30:10.460
You will never be able
to move on until you know.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.593
- And neither will Aiden.

30:12.636 --> 30:14.290
Look, if I was in his shoes,

30:14.334 --> 30:16.640
I wouldn't wanna be
second place to anyone

30:17.990 --> 30:20.470
Maybe this is about both of you
finding the person

30:20.514 --> 30:22.255
you were meant to be with.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.393
- I would have never even
thought of doing that.

30:30.437 --> 30:31.873
You're the man, Rakesh.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.135
- Nah.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.397
I mean, if you say so,

30:34.441 --> 30:36.225
but--nah, I'm kidding,
I'm kidding.

30:36.269 --> 30:38.401
It's a team effort.
- That's right.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.926
- Cheers.
- Cheers, guys.

30:44.190 --> 30:45.974
Hmm?

30:46.018 --> 30:48.542
- I am so proud of you.
- What?

30:48.585 --> 30:50.196
No, Tom would have figured out

30:50.239 --> 30:51.893
how to float the ISB
on his own.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.721
I just gave him a little nudge.

30:53.764 --> 30:57.072
- No, I meant how much
your team respects you.

30:57.116 --> 30:59.988
I can see why Simon Hayes says
as well.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.776
Everything's gonna be okay,
Rakesh.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.169
You know that, right?

31:09.737 --> 31:12.392
You need to tell Simon Hayes
you're gonna take the job.

31:12.435 --> 31:13.567
- Mm-mm.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.917
I don't think I can do that,
Jaya.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.919
- Rakesh, this is--
- Okay, wait--look.

31:17.963 --> 31:20.835
Please, let me just say this.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.534
The last six months
have been hard.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.537
Like, really hard.

31:27.581 --> 31:29.931
And we talk and FaceTime
each other and email

31:29.975 --> 31:31.498
and pretend like
that's the same thing

31:31.541 --> 31:34.588
as being together,
but come on, it's not.

31:34.631 --> 31:37.678
And we both know that.

31:37.721 --> 31:42.378
I'm just scared that eventually
I'm gonna lose you.

31:42.422 --> 31:45.425
- You waited six months for me,

31:45.468 --> 31:47.862
you don't think I'll do
the same for you?

31:49.385 --> 31:50.473
We'll be fine.

31:50.517 --> 31:53.172
- Jaya, you can't make
that promise.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.088
- Yeah, I can.

31:56.131 --> 31:59.613
- How can you be so sure?

31:59.656 --> 32:03.095
- Because I love you.

32:07.708 --> 32:10.319
- Hey, Rakesh, there you are.

32:10.363 --> 32:11.668
Hi.
- Hi.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.409
- Simon Hayes.
- Jaya Desai, nice to meet you.

32:13.453 --> 32:15.934
- Nice to meet you.
You mind if I steal him?

32:15.977 --> 32:18.545
- I'll be right here waiting
for you when you're done.

32:20.155 --> 32:22.288
- Okay.
- Come on.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.691
- Can I help you find
something?

32:34.735 --> 32:37.477
- Yeah, as a matter of fact,
you can.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.740
I'm looking for Noah.
- Oh, he's not here right now.

32:39.783 --> 32:41.176
- Do you know when
he'll be back?

32:41.220 --> 32:44.658
- Ma'am, it's super important.
- Guys...

32:44.701 --> 32:47.052
you're gonna wanna see this.

32:58.324 --> 33:01.109
- That's the photo he took
of me at the end of the night.

33:01.153 --> 33:03.242
- Well, you were wondering
if he remembered you.

33:03.285 --> 33:06.158
- I think this is his way
of saying that he does.

33:07.811 --> 33:11.598
- I remember--I remember how
the story ends.

33:13.948 --> 33:16.124
Oh, I can't believe it.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.780
- Vivian?

33:22.913 --> 33:26.787
- Aiden.
I can explain.

33:29.094 --> 33:34.012
- No, you don't have to.
I think I have my answer.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.804
- Aiden--Aiden, wait.

33:43.847 --> 33:45.240
What are you doing here?

33:45.284 --> 33:46.720
- I got your message.

33:46.763 --> 33:48.548
You said you were
at Honeysuckle Row,

33:48.591 --> 33:50.245
so I went down there,
'cause I thought we still had

33:50.289 --> 33:53.379
something to talk about,
to save.

33:53.422 --> 33:55.076
- Aiden--
- And when I got there,

33:55.120 --> 33:58.384
you were leaving,
so I followed you, and, uh...

33:58.427 --> 34:01.213
I'm glad I did,
because...

34:01.256 --> 34:03.389
I don't wanna be
someone's second choice.

34:04.825 --> 34:08.089
And as painful as this is,

34:08.133 --> 34:11.440
I still love you,
and I want you to be happy.

34:11.484 --> 34:13.921
So, you deserve to be

34:13.964 --> 34:16.706
with someone that makes you
smile like that.

34:16.750 --> 34:19.274
- I'm glad you think that.

34:23.713 --> 34:27.108
Because that someone is you.

34:27.152 --> 34:31.112
- What are you talking about?
- Seeing this picture,

34:31.156 --> 34:33.201
my memory of what happened
that night

34:33.245 --> 34:35.290
finally became clear.

34:37.249 --> 34:39.164
We ended up in Central Park.

34:39.207 --> 34:42.776
I wanted to see the sun rise,
and I knew the perfect spot:

34:42.819 --> 34:45.213
Belvedere Castle.

34:45.257 --> 34:47.607
And that's when I realized
I was standing in

34:47.650 --> 34:50.697
exactly the spot
where you proposed.

34:51.785 --> 34:55.354
It was like the universe was
trying to tell me something.

34:55.397 --> 34:58.618
Something I knew all along.

34:58.661 --> 35:01.882
I didn't fall in love
with someone else that night,

35:01.925 --> 35:04.580
I realized how much I love you.

35:04.624 --> 35:06.191
- Viv--
- Do you know what

35:06.234 --> 35:08.584
I was thinking about
when that photo was taken?

35:08.628 --> 35:11.848
I was thinking about you,
about us,

35:11.892 --> 35:15.200
about the life we were
gonna have.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.767
That's what I was coming back
to tell you that morning,

35:17.811 --> 35:19.682
that I love you,
that you're my--

35:19.726 --> 35:21.554
- Soul mate.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.472
Hi, I'm Fliss.

35:26.515 --> 35:27.951
-  Fliss.

35:33.305 --> 35:36.569
- I don't think that I can
just pick up where we left off.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.179
- Yeah, I know.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.442
I know, but maybe we can
get back there.

35:42.531 --> 35:45.360
I don't care if it takes
ten months or ten years,

35:45.404 --> 35:47.449
I'm not going anywhere.

35:47.493 --> 35:51.236
- I think I just need
some time...

35:51.279 --> 35:55.153
to take a walk to try
to figure this out.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.071
Do you wanna come with me?

36:04.858 --> 36:06.599
- More than anything.

36:08.296 --> 36:10.168
Thank you, both of you.

36:17.392 --> 36:19.786
- Well, I think those two are

36:19.829 --> 36:21.266
gonna have their happy ending
after all.

36:21.309 --> 36:24.051
- Looks like our work here
is done.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.096
We deserve a drink.
Fliss, you coming?

36:26.140 --> 36:28.447
- I would love a cocktail.

36:31.319 --> 36:32.842
Noah?

36:32.886 --> 36:35.932
- Hey, didn't you used to
live across the hall from me?

36:35.976 --> 36:37.543
- Uh-huh.

36:37.586 --> 36:38.718
- What brings you here?

36:38.761 --> 36:42.678
- Oh, that's a very long story.

36:42.722 --> 36:44.289
- I love long stories.

36:50.860 --> 36:54.777
- So, Rakesh,
you made a decision?

36:54.821 --> 36:57.998
- It's an amazing opportunity,
Mr. Hayes...

36:58.041 --> 37:00.914
- Simon's fine, and I've been
in enough negotiations

37:00.957 --> 37:02.742
to realize when someone's
about to flip a card,

37:02.785 --> 37:04.047
so what is it?

37:04.091 --> 37:07.050
- Okay, um, well...

37:07.094 --> 37:10.445
According to you,
I'm the best coder you've got,

37:10.489 --> 37:14.493
and the project would be
way better with me on board.

37:14.536 --> 37:16.277
- Mm-hmm.

37:16.321 --> 37:20.281
- So here's what I propose:

37:20.325 --> 37:24.198
move the project here
to New York,

37:24.242 --> 37:25.678
and you won't be disappointed.

37:25.721 --> 37:27.984
- Okay, just so we understand
each other...

37:28.028 --> 37:29.943
Instead of me moving you
to Palo Alto,

37:29.986 --> 37:33.903
you want me to move
my entire team to New York?

37:33.947 --> 37:35.644
- Yes.

37:35.688 --> 37:37.603
- I assume this is
a deal breaker?

37:37.646 --> 37:39.126
- I'm afraid it is.

37:39.169 --> 37:42.042
- Wow, I'm impressed.

37:43.478 --> 37:45.741
It takes a lot of courage
to stand up to the boss.

37:47.613 --> 37:49.702
You mind me asking
what's so important here

37:49.745 --> 37:52.052
that you're willing to give up
the opportunity of a lifetime?

37:59.059 --> 38:00.974
- Love.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.370
- Okay, well,
I have to think about it.

38:05.413 --> 38:08.634
Mm-hmm.
Okay, then.

38:08.677 --> 38:11.332
Hey, um...

38:13.508 --> 38:15.467
It's a good answer.

38:26.521 --> 38:28.349
- That was fast.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.438
Please tell me you didn't
turn down the offer.

38:30.482 --> 38:33.833
- I turned down Palo Alto,
not the offer.

38:33.876 --> 38:35.138
- What do you mean?

38:35.182 --> 38:37.532
- Well, I told him
if he wants me on the project,

38:37.576 --> 38:39.839
then the project needs
to relocate to New York.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.928
- What did he say?

38:41.971 --> 38:43.799
- He needs to think about it.

38:43.843 --> 38:45.888
- And that's it, you just left?

38:45.932 --> 38:49.239
- I had somewhere to be.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.590
I realized I forgot
to tell you something.

38:51.633 --> 38:54.332
- What?

38:54.375 --> 38:55.637
- I love you, too.

38:55.681 --> 38:57.900
- ♪ I want nothing but
to hold ya ♪

38:57.944 --> 38:59.598
♪ I wanna taste your breath

39:00.947 --> 39:03.732

39:06.126 --> 39:08.084
♪ You're the one

39:08.128 --> 39:11.566
- I feel like we just survived
a romantic comedy.

39:11.610 --> 39:12.915
- I know, right?

39:12.959 --> 39:15.396
Hey, who knew love stories
would be so exhausting?

39:15.440 --> 39:17.485
- I have to admit,

39:17.529 --> 39:19.444
I was pulling for Aiden
the whole time.

39:19.487 --> 39:21.881
I think it is nice to see
two people realize

39:21.924 --> 39:24.231
that they're right
for each other all along.

39:26.494 --> 39:28.844
- I couldn't agree more.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.066
- Though, weren't you the one
that said

39:33.109 --> 39:37.418
"love is one of the few things
in life we cannot choose"?

39:37.462 --> 39:38.985
- When did I say that?

39:39.028 --> 39:40.769
- After we helped
Beaker and Fliss.

39:42.684 --> 39:46.427
- Okay, I see, using my own
words against me, well played.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.563
- Wait, didn't we end up

39:51.606 --> 39:53.391
on this same street the night
we helped Fliss?

39:53.434 --> 39:56.176
- Yeah, yeah, you're right.

39:57.482 --> 40:00.093
- Wow, that's weird.

40:00.136 --> 40:03.270
I was just talking to her
about that night.

40:03.313 --> 40:04.445
- Why?

40:04.489 --> 40:06.360
Um...

40:08.580 --> 40:11.844
Before Eli showed up...

40:13.759 --> 40:16.849
I was gonna ask you out...

40:16.892 --> 40:18.546
on a date.

40:20.853 --> 40:22.376
- Really?

40:22.420 --> 40:25.205
- If I had,
what would you have said?

40:28.034 --> 40:32.212
- You could ask me now
and find out.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.389
- Okay.

40:36.912 --> 40:39.132
Cara Bloom...
- Mm-hmm.

40:41.047 --> 40:43.266
- Will you go to dinner
with me?

40:46.574 --> 40:47.967
- I'd love to.

40:48.010 --> 40:50.926

♪ We'll be treading in

40:57.846 --> 41:00.370
There is always that
inner voice telling you

41:00.414 --> 41:03.591
to hold back from making
a big commitment...

41:03.635 --> 41:07.856
- Aiden, I'll understand if
you wanna wait on the wedding.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.860
- You know,
I've been thinking about that.

41:11.904 --> 41:14.297
If we don't get married,
then...

41:14.341 --> 41:16.386
we're gonna have to give back
all those gifts.

41:20.695 --> 41:25.439
- Or moving into
the next chapter of your life.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.006
- You all right?

41:27.049 --> 41:30.009
- First sermon at
Harlem Episcopal,

41:30.052 --> 41:31.576
I'm a little nervous.

41:31.619 --> 41:33.534

- New York, it is.

41:53.598 --> 41:54.990
- Oh, thank God.

41:55.034 --> 41:57.689
- So I'll be relocating
the team here, and um,

41:57.732 --> 41:59.125
you know,
I'll be staying for awhile

41:59.168 --> 42:00.648
until things get up
and running.

42:00.692 --> 42:02.476
- I guess the only thing left
is for you to tell me

42:02.520 --> 42:04.565
what this top secret project
is.

42:06.915 --> 42:08.569
- Let's just say
that we're gonna be helping out

42:08.613 --> 42:10.876
a lot of people, okay, Rakesh?

42:12.791 --> 42:14.793
- Because when you do,

you'll be amazed
at the results.

42:17.404 --> 42:21.277

42:44.736 --> 42:47.303
- I thought we could walk
