00:02.135 --> 00:04.236
How did you ever
get ready for our wedding?

00:04.238 --> 00:06.238
- Mommy.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.174
- Oh, that's right.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.443
- I had blocked out the fact
that you were 30

00:11.445 --> 00:14.113
And still living at home.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.314
- 29.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.515
- Yeah, whatever.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.783
- By the way,

00:17.785 --> 00:19.451
I'm not dancing
at this thing, okay?

00:19.453 --> 00:20.719
So don't even ask.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.454
- Come on!
I want to dance with you!

00:22.456 --> 00:24.790
- No, no.

00:24.792 --> 00:28.293
When I dance, people think
I'm looking for my keys.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.197
- Yes, but if you
dance with me,

00:32.199 --> 00:33.399
Then you can look
for my keys.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.333
- Hmm.
No, no, no.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.667
No, no, sorry, no.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.370
- You are so unromantic.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.272
- What?
You know I don't like dancing.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.608
- You know
I do like dancing.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.643
- Then why did
you marry me?

00:47.280 --> 00:48.747
Well?

00:50.617 --> 00:52.718
- I'm thinking.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.530
- Okay, okay...

01:04.532 --> 01:06.732
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

02:12.299 --> 02:16.301
Okay, all right, comin'.

02:23.776 --> 02:26.445
- Hey, hey, ray.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.679
- Whoa.
No, no, no.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.381
- I told you
the knicks would win.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.583
- Hey, what do you got to eat?
It's Tuesday. Manicotti, right?

02:31.585 --> 02:32.784
- No--no, kevin!
- I'm hungry!

02:32.786 --> 02:33.886
- No, you're not hungry.

02:33.888 --> 02:35.654
Come on, you guys gotta
get out of here.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.755
- Hey, you want to go
to the track?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.423
- No, no.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.725
- Come on, that horse is running
that I know the trainer.

02:39.727 --> 02:40.859
- That doesn't mean
he's gonna win.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.729
- Yeah, but we
can feed him after.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.164
- Come on.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.298
- You hold
your hand flat--

02:46.300 --> 02:47.666
- Guys, please,
please, please.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.168
Come on, you gotta
leave, all right?

02:49.170 --> 02:50.602
You gotta.
Debra's coming over.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.904
- Debra...

02:51.906 --> 02:53.472
I don't know how
you got so lucky.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.940
- I don't either,

02:54.942 --> 02:57.309
And I don't need to draw
her attention to it, okay?

02:57.311 --> 02:58.677
Come on.
- She's hot, you know?

02:58.679 --> 03:00.279
- Yeah, I know.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.613
- No, I mean,
she really hot.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.215
- I know that, kevin.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.683
- She is hot.
You know, the guys at work--

03:04.685 --> 03:07.352
- All right, guys!
I know, I know she's hot!

03:07.354 --> 03:09.388
- Did you tell her newsday
promoted you to columnist?

03:09.390 --> 03:11.557
- I-I'm doing that tonight.
Come on!

03:11.559 --> 03:13.358
- Hey, what's the story
on the jell-o?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.794
- It's to go.
Take it out.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.429
- We just got here!

03:17.431 --> 03:19.531
- Come on, I'm asking her
to marry me.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.341
- Tonight?

03:29.343 --> 03:30.409
- Yeah.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.744
Yes, I just got the job,

03:32.746 --> 03:33.779
So I'm asking her.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.317
- You're asking debra
to marry you tonight?

03:40.420 --> 03:42.487
- Yes.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.323
- What's she gonna say?

03:48.595 --> 03:52.764
- She's gonna say,
"why are kevin and andy here?"

03:55.335 --> 03:57.502
Come on, guys,
you gotta go.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.571
- Where do we go?

03:59.573 --> 04:03.742
- This is all so sudden.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.776
- Congratulations.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.745
- Yeah, thanks.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.846
- Hi, guys.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.248
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.417
- What's wrong with them?

04:12.419 --> 04:14.386
- Oh, they wanted jell-o,
and it's not for them.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.355
I told them.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.825
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.427
- Guess what.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.596
Carrots instead
of potato chips, fatty.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.032
- It's muscle,
it's muscle.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.434
- Hi, fatty.
Hi, little hiney.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.036
Yeah.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.838
Here, that's for you.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.640
- Well, no, wait.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.541
I told you to get one
of your romantic, mushy movies

04:36.543 --> 04:38.710
You always like to see.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.845
- Yeah, but you love this one.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.014
We'll see mine next week.

04:42.016 --> 04:45.751
- It's planet of the apes.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.686
- Yeah, but didn't you say
that was a classic?

04:47.688 --> 04:49.788
Monkeys riding horses.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.859
- Yeah, I mean,
it's a classic but...

04:53.861 --> 04:56.361
I don't know, you gotta be like
in the mood for it.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.362
Why don't we just...

04:57.364 --> 04:58.630
You know what?

04:58.632 --> 04:59.965
Why don't we just--
we'll sit, and we--

04:59.967 --> 05:02.434
I'll sit over here.

05:09.342 --> 05:10.909
And, uh, we'll just--
you know what we'll do?

05:10.911 --> 05:12.778
We'll eat some carrot sticks,
and, uh...

05:12.780 --> 05:15.981
We'll talk.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.783
- Ray, I told you,

05:17.785 --> 05:20.419
I'm not having sex
on your mom's plastic couch.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.523
- But I...

05:24.525 --> 05:26.825
I don't want...

05:26.827 --> 05:28.393
No...

05:28.395 --> 05:30.529
I don't want sex,
all right?

05:30.531 --> 05:35.567
I just--
I want a carrot, that's all.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.370
- Okay, we'll go to your room.
Come on.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.106
- What? No, wait!
No, no, no!

05:41.108 --> 05:42.407
- What do you mean, "no"?

05:42.409 --> 05:43.909
- No, I mean, no for now.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.878
Yes in a few minutes.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.380
- What do you want?

05:48.382 --> 05:49.948
- All right,
just sit down.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.050
Sit down.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.853
Um, something happened--

05:54.855 --> 05:57.789
I want to show you
something.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.926
This is the early edition
of tomorrow's newsday,

06:00.928 --> 06:04.029
And I wanted
to show you somethin'

06:04.031 --> 06:06.665
Before anybody else
knows about it.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.700
- What happened?
Did you do something illegal?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.636
- No.
No, no, no.

06:11.638 --> 06:14.005
There's
this great column.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.006
I want you
to read it.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.943
It's from
this new guy.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.578
Oh, here it is.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.779
He's really--
he's a great writer,

06:20.781 --> 06:23.115
Even though he is
a little weird-lookin'.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.449
He's a--
look at his picture.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.917
- [gasps]

06:25.919 --> 06:26.885
- Yeah,
he's weird-lookin'.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.954
- Ahh!

06:28.956 --> 06:30.522
Oh, my god!

06:30.524 --> 06:32.657
Oh, god,
when did this happen?

06:32.659 --> 06:33.892
- It happened Monday.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.694
I didn't even tell
my family yet.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.596
I just--I wanted you
to be the first to see it.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.664
- "more than a game"
by raymond barone.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.000
Oh, my god!
Oh, ray!

06:42.002 --> 06:45.871
Oh, good,
I'm so happy for you.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.572
- Whoops!

06:49.976 --> 06:52.978
Sorry.

06:52.980 --> 06:57.849
You guys finishing up
or just starting?

06:57.851 --> 06:59.184
- Dad!

06:59.186 --> 07:00.685
Come on, what are
you doing back here?

07:00.687 --> 07:05.724
- Relax, romeo, I forgot
my driving glasses.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.858
I would have kept going,

07:06.860 --> 07:13.064
But your mother thinks
I hit a deer.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.132
- Ray, tell your dad.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.767
- No, no, no,
not now.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.569
- What?
What, did you break something?

07:17.571 --> 07:18.670
- No, no!

07:18.672 --> 07:19.871
- Look, frank, look.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.040
- Wait, wait,
what is it?

07:22.042 --> 07:23.775
Hey, it's you.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.912
- Yeah, it's his column.
He's a columnist.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.815
- Holy crap.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.883
A columnist?

07:31.885 --> 07:33.852
But newsday is
like a real paper.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.854
- Yeah, well, I guess
I slipped through the cracks.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.722
- Hey, wait, wait, wait,
I wanna read this.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.658
It's not every day a son of mine
amounts to something.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.059
- Dad, please, come on,

07:41.061 --> 07:42.761
Mom's waiting for you
in the car.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.729
- She's fine.
I cracked the window.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.165
- Dad, please,
give it to me.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.501
- "as a boy,
sports was the only way

07:49.503 --> 07:51.870
I could connect
with my father."

07:51.872 --> 07:53.538
- Dad.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.706
- "the first game
he took me to

07:54.708 --> 07:56.975
"was at yankee stadium
when I was eight.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.978
"bobby murcer homered
in the ninth to win it.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.747
"I thought nothing
could be more thrilling.

08:02.749 --> 08:06.084
"then on the ride home,
my father talked to me.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.253
"he listened.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.489
"he shared his passion
for sports with me.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.891
"I love sports
for many reasons now,

08:12.893 --> 08:14.125
"but I have to say

08:14.127 --> 08:16.661
That what drew me to the games
as a young boy

08:16.663 --> 08:18.063
Was the ride home."

08:21.801 --> 08:26.004
What, are you saying
I didn't talk to you?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.139
What is this?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.774
Is that what you're saying?

08:29.776 --> 08:31.543
- All right, dad,
that's not what I'm saying.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.177
Now, please,
don't read anymore.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.680
- Frank, I'm in the car.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.984
What are you doing
reading the newspaper?

08:38.986 --> 08:40.585
- He's reading ray's column.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.121
- Yeah, I'm reading
about how terrible I was.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.624
- Ray's column?

08:45.626 --> 08:48.126
- Your son is the new
sports columnist for newsday.

08:48.128 --> 08:51.696
- Oh!

08:51.698 --> 08:53.632
- Okay. All right.
Okay, ma.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.567
- I knew you'd do it.
You're a writer.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.302
I told you
he was smart.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.037
Let me see that.
Let me see that.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.772
- Hey, hey, let go.
It's about me.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.140
- Dad, will you please
give me the newspaper?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.708
- I didn't connect
with you?

09:03.710 --> 09:05.744
- Dad, you're not supposed--
give it to me, dad.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.078
- I'm trying to connect
with you.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.081
Get away from me.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.816
- You're not supposed
to read it!

09:11.818 --> 09:14.052
- What are you afraid of?
I'm finishing this!

09:14.054 --> 09:15.954
"I'm hoping sports
will bring me closer

09:15.956 --> 09:17.589
"to someone else
in my life.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.591
"the person who will be sitting
next to me reading this.

09:19.593 --> 09:22.794
Debra,
will you marry me?"

09:35.007 --> 09:36.741
- For that last part,

09:36.743 --> 09:38.677
He was supposed
to be down on one knee.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.879
- Oh, honey!

09:40.881 --> 09:42.948
- Dad, what did you do?

09:42.950 --> 09:47.852
- Oh, raymond,
it's so wonderful.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.854
- What's going on?

09:49.856 --> 09:52.724
- Oh, raymond just asked
debra to marry him.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.927
- Well, technically.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.729
- And?

09:57.731 --> 10:01.366
- And?
Oh...

10:01.368 --> 10:02.734
- Yes!

10:02.736 --> 10:03.868
[screams]

10:03.870 --> 10:06.004
[both laughing]

10:06.006 --> 10:09.341
[all talking]

10:09.343 --> 10:13.378
- Congratulations
to you both.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.046
- Thank you.
Thank you.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.616
- Oh, I know,
I'm so pleased.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.784
And raymond got
his own column today.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.287
- And his picture
in the paper.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.922
- Oh, look at him.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.690
[all talking at once]

10:25.692 --> 10:28.193
- I can't believe this!

10:42.708 --> 10:46.845
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.214
Read your column.

10:49.216 --> 10:52.183
- Oh, yeah?

10:52.185 --> 10:53.985
- Pretty good.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.756
The stuff about dad
and the ride home.

10:57.758 --> 11:01.726
- Yeah, thanks.

11:01.728 --> 11:04.829
- You know,
I was there too.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.031
- Yeah, no.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.866
I know.
I was going to mention you,

11:07.868 --> 11:09.067
But, you know,
the column's so--

11:09.069 --> 11:10.869
- No, no.

11:18.778 --> 11:23.314
Anyway, congratulations
on the column.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.116
And the engagement.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.423
- Thanks.

11:31.425 --> 11:34.726
You know,
I was wondering if you...

11:34.728 --> 11:37.395
You know, if you wanted to be
best man and all?

11:40.299 --> 11:41.700
- Me?

11:41.702 --> 11:44.335
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.739
- That would be an honor.

11:50.176 --> 11:53.311
- Good, 'cause you're definitely
in the running.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.246
I'm kidding.
It's you.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.715
- It's me?
- It's you. You're in.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.116
- Oh, you're kidding around.
- You're in.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.185
- Good. Best man, yeah.
- Why not?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.821
- That'll be good,
best man.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.156
- That was crazy.
Wasn't that crazy last night?

12:05.158 --> 12:07.792
God, I couldn't even
give debra the ring.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.160
- Why don't you have
dad give it to her?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.328
[laughing]

12:10.330 --> 12:13.298
- Yeah, I get it.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.500
- I can't believe you proposed
to her in front all of them.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.368
- Yeah.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.475
Wait a minute.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.944
- What?

12:25.946 --> 12:29.380
- What if she wanted
to say no?

12:29.382 --> 12:32.217
- What do you mean?

12:32.219 --> 12:33.952
- She was in front
of the whole family.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.320
She had to say yes.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.354
- Come on.

12:36.356 --> 12:39.224
- Plus, I put it
in the paper.

12:39.226 --> 12:42.060
Oh, no,
why did I do that?

12:42.062 --> 12:44.129
She couldn't say no.

12:44.131 --> 12:47.332
Oh, my god.
I am a jack ass.

12:50.102 --> 12:54.005
- I think you're supposed to put
the accent on the jack.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.206
- Oh, god,
what did I do?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.208
I'm like one of those losers
at the ball game

12:57.210 --> 13:00.245
That rents a blimp.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.481
Oh, "marry me, hilda."
yeah.

13:03.483 --> 13:07.318
Hilda can't say no.
They'll throw beer on her.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.220
- Would you stop, okay?

13:09.222 --> 13:11.022
- Think about it.
Think about it. Really.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.423
She's hot, right?

13:12.425 --> 13:14.092
- Oh, yeah, you know,
the guys at the precinct...

13:14.094 --> 13:16.494
- Okay, okay, okay!

13:16.496 --> 13:20.131
So why me, huh?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.867
I mean, well, look at me.
Look at me.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.269
Look at me, man.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.403
I mean, from the front,
all right, I'm okay.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.105
I can get by
from the front.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.575
But look at
my profile.

13:30.577 --> 13:34.512
I'm a flamingo.

13:34.514 --> 13:37.515
- Everybody thinks
I'm the weird one.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.350
- No, you know I'm right.
You know I'm right.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.085
- Raymond, calm down, okay?

13:41.087 --> 13:43.087
Let's look at the facts,
all right?

13:43.089 --> 13:45.023
She comes over,
right away you get a kiss.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.891
Always.

13:46.893 --> 13:50.495
- Well, so?
I get that from mom.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.297
- That must be nice too.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.236
How about when debra's
sitting next to you, right?

13:58.238 --> 14:00.271
She always has to be
right up against you.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.473
Holding your hand,
playing with your hair.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.042
You both make me sick.

14:07.413 --> 14:11.950
You know why she wants
to marry you, raymond?

14:11.952 --> 14:15.386
Because she loves you.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.522
That's why she said yes.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.461
- Maybe.

14:26.265 --> 14:27.899
- Where are you going?

14:27.901 --> 14:30.501
- I've gotta give her
another chance to say no.

14:33.339 --> 14:36.107
- Flamingo.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.210
[laughs]
yeah.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.150
[door knocking]

14:46.152 --> 14:50.922
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:50.924 --> 14:54.192
- So?

14:54.194 --> 14:55.426
Feel different, huh?

14:55.428 --> 14:57.562
- Why, do you
feel different?

14:57.564 --> 14:58.963
- Of course.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.266
- Like, doomed?

15:01.268 --> 15:05.303
- Yes, exactly like that.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.940
- Listen, listen.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.141
Last night,

15:10.143 --> 15:13.344
When my father asked
you to marry me

15:13.346 --> 15:19.117
And you said yes
to my mother...

15:19.119 --> 15:22.253
I'm wondering
if maybe...

15:23.956 --> 15:25.924
- What?

15:25.926 --> 15:28.092
- Well, like, maybe
you felt pressured,

15:28.094 --> 15:31.296
Like you were
at a ball park.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.531
- What?

15:33.533 --> 15:36.200
- All right,
let me ask you again.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.702
Okay, nobody's--
nobody's here.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.104
You can say
whatever you want.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.940
Do you really
want to marry me?

15:41.942 --> 15:43.174
- [gasps]

15:43.176 --> 15:45.643
Oh, my god!

15:50.049 --> 15:52.650
- Wait, wait, is that for me
or for the ring?

15:52.652 --> 15:56.354
- Oh, my god!
This is so beautiful.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.456
- Okay, but would you
still want me without the ring?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.358
- What are you
talking about?

16:00.360 --> 16:01.726
I can't believe this.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.728
Lookit. I can't wait
to show everybody.

16:03.730 --> 16:08.232
Wait, I gotta look at this
under the light.

16:08.234 --> 16:11.102
- I'm never going to get
a straight answer now.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.102
- Oh, it's gorgeous!

16:12.104 --> 16:13.738
- Gimme that ring
for a second, please.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.273
- No, no, no, no.
Give me my ring back.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.208
- Wait, please, wait!

16:17.210 --> 16:18.476
Do you really want
to marry me?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.477
- What?
Yes!

16:19.479 --> 16:21.379
- Take your time!

16:23.282 --> 16:27.685
Think...One more time.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.554
[sighs]

16:42.568 --> 16:44.769
Do you really
wanna marry me?

16:47.506 --> 16:51.509
- Yes, ray,
I really wanna marry you.

16:58.717 --> 17:01.386
I got the ring!
I got the ring!

17:01.388 --> 17:02.587
Oh, I love it.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.455
It's great.
Come here.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.257
Come here, I gotta show you
all my plans here.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.126
- Plans?
What do you mean?

17:08.128 --> 17:09.660
- Yeah, for the wedding.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.796
- You're already
planning the wedding?

17:11.798 --> 17:14.132
- I've been planning it
since I was 12.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.202
You didn't meet me
till you were 22.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.605
- Well, you're the last piece
of the puzzle.

17:25.677 --> 17:27.412
- Yeah.
You're sure that I fit?

17:27.414 --> 17:30.481
You're not, like, cramming me
in there, right?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.150
- Ok, ok,
look at this.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.217
These bridesmaids dresses.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.519
Do you like that color?

17:34.521 --> 17:36.054
- Yeah, they're great

17:36.056 --> 17:39.557
If they're going to jog
to church at night, I guess.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.194
- Ha ha.
Come on, this is important.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.796
- So this is all
about the wedding.

17:44.798 --> 17:47.265
- Of course it's
about the wedding.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.666
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a second.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.202
What if I told you
forget about all this?

17:51.204 --> 17:52.470
Huh? Would you still
wanna marry me

17:52.472 --> 17:53.638
If we couldn't have
a big wedding?

17:53.640 --> 17:54.439
- I don't need
a big wedding.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.807
That's fine.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.842
- Wait, wait, what about
what your sister had?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.210
- Oh, god, that was
way too much.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.578
I wouldn't
want that anyway.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.514
- So, you're not just excited
now about a big wedding?

18:03.516 --> 18:05.383
You'd marry me even if
we had a small wedding.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.452
- Oh, honey, listen,
if you want a small wedding,

18:07.454 --> 18:09.187
We'll have
a small wedding, ok?

18:09.189 --> 18:12.190
- You're good with
a small wedding?

18:12.192 --> 18:13.791
- Of course.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.393
- And I'm still honey?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.728
- Yes, you are.

18:19.798 --> 18:20.798
- Ok.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.799
[doorbell rings]

18:21.801 --> 18:23.401
Aah, my parents!

18:23.403 --> 18:24.669
- Oh, boy.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.806
[all talking at once]

18:32.344 --> 18:34.412
- Hello there,
son-in-law.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.748
- Hello there...You.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.285
- You know,
on the way down here,

18:41.287 --> 18:46.224
I was busy reading my favorite
sports columnist.

18:46.226 --> 18:50.428
Boy, that mike lupica
can really write.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.731
Congratulations, ray.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.399
- I've never been
a sports fan,

18:55.401 --> 18:59.470
But now...Go sports!

18:59.472 --> 19:01.339
- Ok.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.473
- Look, mom.

19:02.475 --> 19:06.477
- Is that adorable?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.578
- Hey, we gotta talk date.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.247
- Oh, yes.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.681
I checked, and the country
club is only available

19:10.683 --> 19:13.684
On June 3 or the 17th.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.753
- It's the big room, dear.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.755
- Of course
it's the big room.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.892
Big room, big band,
big shrimp.

19:20.894 --> 19:24.262
- So, like, 200,
250 tops.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.833
- 250? People?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.568
- Yeah, why?
What did you have in mind?

19:30.570 --> 19:33.304
- A small wedding.
Like 20 people.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.174
[laughter]

19:36.176 --> 19:37.909
Ok, 2o each.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.243
- 40?

19:40.445 --> 19:42.180
- You said a small wedding.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.581
You said you didn't care about
a big wedding.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.850
- Ray, but 40 people
is not a wedding.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.518
That's like a barbecue.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.457
- So you do care
about the wedding.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.526
- Honey, I told you
I've been imagining this

19:55.528 --> 19:57.395
Since I was 12 years old.

19:57.397 --> 20:01.199
- You knew 200 people
when you were 12?

20:01.201 --> 20:03.401
- You know, last month,
I was at a wedding

20:03.403 --> 20:05.403
Where they
released doves.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.872
- Oh, can't believe
you said that.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.774
I have a picture of it
right here.

20:11.276 --> 20:12.710
- Doves?

20:12.712 --> 20:13.710
- Have you picked
out your colors yet?

20:13.712 --> 20:14.710
- I wanted to talk to you
about that.

20:14.712 --> 20:16.614
- Oh, and the centerpieces.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.349
Do you know what
they're doing now?

20:18.351 --> 20:19.684
The base is a fishbowl.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.885
- With fish in it?

20:20.887 --> 20:22.553
- Well, of course,
with fish in it.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.821
- God, that would be so great.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.924
- So, ladies,
the third or the 17th?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.359
[both]
17th.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.494
- The chocolatier isn't
available until then.

20:30.496 --> 20:31.762
- Yes, and that'll give me a
chance for another fitting.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.431
- Yes.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.299
- Ralph, it's warren.

20:35.301 --> 20:39.403
Big room. Mm-hmm.
The 17th.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.738
Right.

20:45.344 --> 20:46.777
- I'm invited, right?
