00:13.916 --> 00:15.291
My…

00:15.375 --> 00:17.375
So now you'll be
going off to university, Ryo.

00:17.958 --> 00:20.416
Not long ago, you were only this tall.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.500
Cut it out. That was ages ago.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.416
You talk like an old man now,
Uncle Kazuya.

00:25.916 --> 00:28.250
-That's mean!
-But it's true.

00:29.250 --> 00:32.458
So you'll be living in Tokyo from April.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.000
-You'll be lonely, won't you, Sanae?
-Yes.

00:36.083 --> 00:40.333
There are good schools here,
but he insisted on going to Tokyo.

00:40.416 --> 00:43.500
Quit complaining. I've got a scholarship.
It won't cost you a dime.

00:43.583 --> 00:44.708
Oh really?

00:45.291 --> 00:47.000
There's nothing wrong with Tokyo.

00:48.041 --> 00:49.583
It was Ryo's decision, after all.

00:49.666 --> 00:53.416
See? You know how they say to let
your beloved children spread their wings.

00:56.166 --> 01:00.000
But I really appreciate
all you've done for me, Uncle Kazuya.

01:02.083 --> 01:03.208
What's that all about?

01:04.750 --> 01:05.625
Well,

01:06.833 --> 01:10.083
you've always been like a father to me.

01:13.416 --> 01:15.958
Ryo, you do your best.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.041
I will.

01:41.125 --> 01:42.291

TOUTO NEWS

02:57.166 --> 02:59.000
Look at her. She's the one.

02:59.583 --> 03:00.708
She seems like a nice girl.

03:00.791 --> 03:05.000
<i>In line with Eishin scandal news,</i>
<i>pop idol Ai used the hashtag…</i>

03:05.083 --> 03:07.291
- I'm back.
-Welcome back.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.083
<i>…causing a stir.</i>

03:09.166 --> 03:12.833
<i>These kinds of tweets by show business</i>
<i>personalities about the Eishin scandal…</i>

03:12.916 --> 03:15.791
There's no reason to take it this far.

03:15.875 --> 03:18.250
<i>What is your opinion on this, Mr. Toyoda?</i>

03:19.333 --> 03:23.291
<i>She knows nothing, so she shouldn't</i>
<i>go speaking indiscreetly about politics.</i>

03:23.375 --> 03:25.583
<i>And what's worse, she's just a pop idol.</i>

03:25.666 --> 03:31.250
<i>When people who can influence society</i>
<i>improperly criticize the government…</i>

03:31.333 --> 03:34.333
Who are you to say what's improper,
you lowlife?

03:35.458 --> 03:39.791
Celebrities have their own thoughts.
Why can't they say what they like?

03:40.750 --> 03:43.083
-What a dumb show.
-Goodbye.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.791
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.250
Let's change the channel.

03:49.208 --> 03:51.125
The case closed
without any charges being pressed?

03:51.208 --> 03:53.541
NO INDICTMENTS AGAINST 24,
INCLUDING MOURI, IN EISHIN SCANDAL

03:53.625 --> 03:56.416
I wonder if it'll all just fade away
into oblivion.

04:01.833 --> 04:05.583
"Difficulty determining tampering"?
You've got to be kidding me.

04:05.666 --> 04:09.416
72% of people are unhappy with the result.

04:15.291 --> 04:19.375
That is all for the daily press briefing.

04:19.458 --> 04:22.125
-I have another question.
-We've finished.

04:27.291 --> 04:28.208
Go ahead.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.125
Matsuda of Touto News.

04:30.208 --> 04:32.375
Regarding the Eishin Academy affair,

04:32.458 --> 04:36.125
none of the accused, including former
Finance Bureau Director-General Mouri,

04:36.208 --> 04:39.125
were charged.
What are your thoughts on this?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.250
I believe the decision was made
after a proper investigation.

04:43.333 --> 04:44.791
That is all for today.

04:44.875 --> 04:48.791
Even though the investigation is over,
should the unanswered questions remain so?

04:50.291 --> 04:53.333
<i>Since the prosecutor determined</i>
<i>that no charges would be brought,</i>

04:53.416 --> 04:55.125
<i>that puts an end to it.</i>

04:55.208 --> 04:58.083
<i>I'm sure the Nagoya prosecutor</i>
<i>investigated aggressively,</i>

04:58.166 --> 05:02.125
<i>but some believe there was pressure</i>
<i>from above to end the investigation.</i>

05:02.750 --> 05:04.541
You know that muckraking reporter?

05:05.250 --> 05:06.750
-Yes.
-What's going on?

05:07.458 --> 05:08.541
<i>Such accusations are untrue.</i>

05:08.625 --> 05:11.166
Is she still going on about
Eishin Academy?

05:11.250 --> 05:13.458
<i>…claims that it has ended</i>
<i>earlier than normal.</i>

05:13.541 --> 05:16.666
Dang! She's really
jumping down his throat again today.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.958
I've got a final interview to go to.
See you later.

05:21.458 --> 05:24.125
Please leave the room promptly.

05:31.750 --> 05:32.875
Come in.

05:32.958 --> 05:33.833
Excuse me.

05:33.916 --> 05:37.666
<i>Even though the investigation is over,</i>
<i>should the unanswered questions remain so?</i>

05:38.416 --> 05:40.333
Looks like everything is resolved.

05:41.041 --> 05:41.916
Yes.

05:43.916 --> 05:48.041
I've heard this reporter
is a problematic one from Touto News.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.958
Yes. The reporter's name is Matsuda.

05:53.083 --> 05:55.166
Is what's written on the file correct?

05:56.000 --> 05:59.583
Her elder brother, Kohei Matsuda,
was a Cabinet Secretariat deputy director?

05:59.666 --> 06:01.916
Yes. When I worked
at the Ministry of Economy,

06:02.000 --> 06:03.916
he worked with me on the Olympics bid.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.833
I see. You worked
on the Olympic bid, did you?

06:08.375 --> 06:10.250
Did you see him at all after that?

06:10.333 --> 06:11.166
No.

06:12.458 --> 06:15.458
I didn't see him, but…

06:16.916 --> 06:19.375
Is this about him
ending up in a vegetative state?

06:22.833 --> 06:24.375
You knew about it?

06:26.208 --> 06:28.250
He picked a fight with the wrong person.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.125
That was Kohei Matsuda's fault.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.208
What do you mean by that?

06:36.833 --> 06:38.791
He was destroyed by Toyoda.

06:42.250 --> 06:44.041
You mean Shinjiro Toyoda?

06:45.166 --> 06:49.166
Murakami, I think
we might be able to use this.

06:50.625 --> 06:53.875
We need to inform the public
that this reporter

06:53.958 --> 06:56.000
isn't the least bit impartial.

07:15.291 --> 07:16.208
Mrs. Suzuki.

07:16.291 --> 07:19.125
Excuse me. I'm from Shukan Buncho.
May I ask some questions?

07:20.166 --> 07:22.291
I know this must be a difficult time.

07:22.375 --> 07:25.291
I'd like to ask about
your husband's document tampering.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.000
Do you know anything about it?

07:27.708 --> 07:29.250
Was he acting strange at home?

07:30.416 --> 07:34.583
Didn't you receive the notice
that I'm not doing any interviews?

07:34.666 --> 07:38.083
He must have told you something
at the hospital before his suicide.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.708
What do you think about your husband's
involvement in the tampering?

08:30.291 --> 08:34.166
I'm terribly sorry
for visiting without notice.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.166
I see you lying in wait even here.

08:49.166 --> 08:50.166
Mrs. Suzuki.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.666
Unless something is done,

08:56.875 --> 09:00.333
everything will be swept under the rug.

09:02.791 --> 09:06.041
Kazuya Suzuki was the victim
of pressure from within the system.

09:07.666 --> 09:11.666
It is my belief that rectifying this
is how we honor the deceased.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.375
This is a problem
that shouldn't be covered up.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.291
Won't you please help with this?

09:27.333 --> 09:30.208
You're Ms. Matsuda, right?

09:31.208 --> 09:32.125
Yes.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.250
I don't think you understand.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.833
You're no different
than the rest of that lot.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.916
At least that's the way it seems to me.

10:10.416 --> 10:12.250
-Here.
-Thank you.

10:12.333 --> 10:16.083
I was really surprised when I heard
you were in CIRO, Murakami.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.583
A lot has happened.

10:17.666 --> 10:19.250
Way too much has happened.

10:19.333 --> 10:21.041
I can totally relate.

10:21.125 --> 10:24.416
It can't really be helped though.
It surprised even me.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.291
How's your family? Doing well?

10:28.083 --> 10:31.916
I've caused them a lot of trouble,
but they're hanging in there for me.

10:32.708 --> 10:35.958
I see.
That's what's most important, you know.

10:39.958 --> 10:41.833
Here are the documents you asked for.

10:42.333 --> 10:45.333
-Don't you dare say you got them from me.
-Of course. Thanks.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.083
REQUEST TO RE-OPEN INVESTIGATION
INTO CORPORATIONS RECEIVING SUBSIDIES

10:52.166 --> 10:54.208
It's really too bad,
what happened to Mr. Matsuda.

10:56.333 --> 10:57.500
Say, Kimata…

11:00.041 --> 11:01.125
what happened to him?

11:03.541 --> 11:04.375
Oh, right.

11:04.875 --> 11:07.500
Since you got quickly promoted
to be the assistant to the First Lady,

11:07.583 --> 11:09.000
-you don't know.
-Yes.

11:09.541 --> 11:12.833
You know about Mr. Toyoda's
AI development program, right?

11:12.916 --> 11:15.125
The one he got
ten billion yen in subsidies for.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.208
There were rumors
that it was practically fraud.

11:18.291 --> 11:19.125
Yes.

11:20.333 --> 11:22.791
Those papers went around
the Ministry of Economy,

11:22.875 --> 11:25.666
and they were going to stop the subsidies,

11:25.750 --> 11:30.083
but Mr. Toyoda was involved.
That stuff usually never gets overturned.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.708
And that's when Kohei raised objections.

11:36.916 --> 11:39.166
I don't know for certain,

11:39.250 --> 11:42.458
but he definitely faced pressure
for getting involved.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.458
I heard the way
he was treated at the company after that

11:45.541 --> 11:47.333
was unbelievably brutal.

11:49.291 --> 11:53.166
Then he suffered a heart attack at work
and went right to the hospital.

11:53.708 --> 11:55.541
It had to be stress from overwork.

11:56.625 --> 11:59.833
Apparently, the company covered it up.

12:04.500 --> 12:08.291
Later, the police investigated
suspicions around the subsidies,

12:08.875 --> 12:12.333
but it was suddenly aborted from above
just before they could arrest him.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.708
How could that be?

12:16.708 --> 12:18.625
This is only a rumor.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.791
That Mr. Toyoda,
he's writing a book about the PM, right?

12:23.375 --> 12:27.291
He apparently has a ton of dirt on the PM
that would cause big trouble if it leaked.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.375
-But that's no reason--
-I know.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.375
I know what you mean.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.625
Murakami.

12:40.708 --> 12:41.708
Yes?

12:42.958 --> 12:45.541
-Recently, I've been thinking…
-What?

12:46.333 --> 12:47.375
Who exactly

12:48.375 --> 12:50.250
are we serving?

12:57.250 --> 13:00.250
Yes. I think the same thing.

13:06.833 --> 13:07.833
I'm home.

13:07.916 --> 13:09.708
Welcome home. You sure are late.

13:09.791 --> 13:10.875
Yeah.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.166
-Where are the kids?
-They went to bed a while ago.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.083
-Oh, of course.
<i>-…deleted the offending tweet</i>

13:16.166 --> 13:17.958
<i>and posted an apology.</i>

13:19.083 --> 13:20.875
<i>Ai retweeted a post</i>
<i>about charges being dropped</i>

13:20.958 --> 13:24.333
<i>against former Finance Bureau Chief Mouri,</i>

13:24.916 --> 13:29.291
<i>adding the hashtag</i>
<i>"Don't drop charges against Mouri."</i>

13:29.375 --> 13:30.583

13:31.083 --> 13:33.458
-Well, more or less.

13:33.541 --> 13:36.250
<i>she'd comment on politics.</i>
<i>What a disappointment."</i>

13:37.000 --> 13:40.416
<i>"I'll never buy her CDs again."</i>
<i>This is one example of all the criticism.</i>

13:40.500 --> 13:41.916
What? Did something happen?

13:42.583 --> 13:43.458
Well,

13:44.708 --> 13:46.958
I get asked a lot of things
at the preschool.

13:47.791 --> 13:50.583
I mean, even celebrities
are making comments like that.

13:50.666 --> 13:53.958
I told you, ignore that kind of thing.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.041
It's easy for you to say.

13:57.958 --> 14:00.250
But what if something happened
to Hayato or Natsuki?

14:04.041 --> 14:05.958
Then what do you want me to do?

14:07.291 --> 14:10.791
You want me to go explain
to them that everything is perfectly fine?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.208
I've got a lot to deal with,
too, you know.

14:18.833 --> 14:19.791
I'm sorry.

14:28.541 --> 14:29.375
No.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.041
I'm sorry too.

I got a job offer!

16:47.000 --> 16:50.500
-Congratulations!
-That's great!

16:50.583 --> 16:53.333
You know, these interviews
make me so anxious.

17:02.458 --> 17:06.000
That time at the airport
was so frustrating.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.500
I thought about quitting the police.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.250
Did the orders come from above?

17:14.791 --> 17:15.750
Yes.

17:16.708 --> 17:19.125
It started with a whistleblower complaint.

17:19.708 --> 17:23.291
It was from a subordinate of Mr. Toyoda
at the same company on the same project.

17:23.375 --> 17:27.375
The whistleblower complaint
was filed by Kohei Matsuda, wasn't it?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.291
-You know him?
-Yes.

17:31.875 --> 17:34.458
He apparently had actual proof as well.

17:34.541 --> 17:37.125
But ultimately, there was
only the leak by Mr. Matsuda.

17:37.208 --> 17:39.500
We never got
any more information after that.

17:41.041 --> 17:44.333
After that, Mr. Matsuda fell ill.

17:45.208 --> 17:48.000
Now all of it's been covered up.

17:53.708 --> 17:57.125
You won't be pursuing that case anymore?

18:00.833 --> 18:02.958
No matter what we do,
I doubt anything can be done.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.416
More than likely, there are forces
behind the scenes at work.

18:15.166 --> 18:17.041
<i>The Eishin Academy scandal</i>
<i>is a tragic affair</i>

18:17.833 --> 18:21.375
that has driven one member
of the Chubu Local Finance Bureau

18:21.458 --> 18:24.500
to take his own life!

18:24.583 --> 18:25.583
PRIME MINISTER, IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

18:25.666 --> 18:29.875
And since those who are truly responsible

18:29.958 --> 18:32.541
are not being held
the least bit responsible,

18:32.625 --> 18:35.583
this is an unforgivable scandal!

18:36.166 --> 18:38.541
-That's right!
-Don't take us for fools!

18:38.625 --> 18:41.250
-Listen up!
-This government…

18:46.875 --> 18:51.416
TOUTO NEWS
JOURNALIST'S DISHONEST COVERAGE STYLE

18:56.083 --> 18:57.666
-Pass these around.
-Yes, sir.

19:00.416 --> 19:02.291
The brother
of the Touto News reporter, Matsuda,

19:02.375 --> 19:05.875
worked as a cabinet deputy director
during the bid for the Olympics.

19:05.958 --> 19:08.083
He fell into a vegetative state
from overwork.

19:08.166 --> 19:11.208
This article states that
Matsuda holds an unjustified grudge

19:11.291 --> 19:14.541
against the current administration
for what happened to her brother.

19:14.625 --> 19:18.916
It will hit the stands next Monday,
so I want you to spread it on social media

19:19.000 --> 19:21.958
with the help of
ruling party supporters online.

19:23.708 --> 19:24.583
Mr. Tada!

19:25.333 --> 19:27.291
I thought I was in charge of this case.

19:29.625 --> 19:32.041
If you were,
you'd never write an article like this.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.083
But…

19:34.625 --> 19:36.666
Kohei has nothing to do with this.

19:38.375 --> 19:40.750
Keep your personal feelings out of it.

19:46.958 --> 19:50.750
We demand that the investigation
into the Eishin scandal be reopened!

19:50.833 --> 19:53.291
-Reopen the investigation!
-Reopen the investigation!

19:53.375 --> 19:56.416
Don't try to fool the people!

19:56.500 --> 19:59.250
-Don't try to fool the people!
-Don't try to fool the people!

19:59.750 --> 20:03.500
Sanae, I'm not feeling well.
I'm going to go home.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.958
Are you all right?
Don't stay if you don't want to.

20:06.458 --> 20:08.333
-Take care.
-We demand an apology!

20:08.416 --> 20:11.250
-We demand an apology!
-We demand an apology!

20:11.333 --> 20:13.625
Stop the lies!

20:14.125 --> 20:16.291
-Stop the lies!
-Oh, excuse me!

20:16.375 --> 20:19.833
We demand an explanation
from the First Lady!

20:19.916 --> 20:21.083
DON'T TRY TO FOOL PEOPLE!

20:21.166 --> 20:23.500
I'm Kijima.

20:24.833 --> 20:27.875
Though it wasn't for long,
I worked with Mr. Suzuki.

20:29.833 --> 20:31.791
We demand the investigation…

20:31.875 --> 20:33.833
Actually, he…

20:36.583 --> 20:40.625
Mr. Suzuki protected me to the very end.

20:41.708 --> 20:42.541
What?

20:45.375 --> 20:48.458
The Ministry of Finance
will release their investigation results

20:48.541 --> 20:50.166
into the Eishin Academy affair soon.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.500
I think that will explain what happened.

20:53.166 --> 20:55.833
I am truly very sorry. Goodbye.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.875
-Stop the lies!
-Stop the lies!

21:00.458 --> 21:03.625
We demand an explanation
from the First Lady!

21:03.708 --> 21:06.541
We demand an explanation
from the First Lady!

21:34.291 --> 21:36.791
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION INTO
TAMPERING OF APPROVAL DOCUMENTS

21:46.166 --> 21:50.625
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION INTO TAMPERING
OF EISHIN ACADEMY APPROVAL DOCUMENTS

21:55.250 --> 21:56.458
This is ridiculous.

22:10.708 --> 22:14.208
TRUE REASON BEHIND
MATSUDA'S OBSTINATE REPORTING

22:29.291 --> 22:33.666
TRUE REASON BEHIND
MATSUDA'S OBSTINATE REPORTING

22:49.625 --> 22:53.791
"She holds a grudge against the government
that made her brother a vegetable."

22:54.833 --> 22:56.333
This is so cruel.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.875
It's getting spread all over
on social media.

23:01.916 --> 23:03.125
It's totally going viral.

23:03.208 --> 23:06.125
SHE'S THE REASON WHY
I DON'T TRUST THE PRESS. TOO PUSHY!

23:06.208 --> 23:09.250
Mr. Sato, did you know about
Ms. Matsuda's brother?

23:09.333 --> 23:11.458
No. The chief never tells me anything.

23:11.541 --> 23:12.583
Good morning.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.500
Good morning.

23:16.250 --> 23:18.041
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

23:23.291 --> 23:24.625
I've seen the article.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.583
If they're taking things this far,

23:32.291 --> 23:36.125
they really must not want us
digging into the Eishin Academy affair.

23:36.208 --> 23:39.875
That may be so, but these kinds
of personal attacks are cruel.

23:41.708 --> 23:43.958
You can't let
this kind of thing bother you.

23:47.250 --> 23:50.125
Matsuda! Come with me for a minute.

24:02.458 --> 24:03.500
Thanks to this article,

24:03.583 --> 24:06.916
the whole newspaper's
journalistic style is being criticized.

24:08.291 --> 24:09.291
Boss,

24:10.000 --> 24:11.583
from what I've heard,

24:11.666 --> 24:14.583
she doesn't use the extreme
reporting methods in the article.

24:14.666 --> 24:15.875
That's not the issue.

24:17.125 --> 24:20.916
This kind of impression can harm
the image of the company as a whole.

24:24.041 --> 24:26.833
At any rate,
that's enough about the Eishin affair.

24:34.208 --> 24:35.333
Matsuda.

24:36.583 --> 24:39.666
I think you have been
a little too obsessed with this affair.

24:41.791 --> 24:44.291
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

24:45.083 --> 24:48.333
If articles like this keep coming out,
it'll hurt the bereaved family.

24:49.416 --> 24:50.958
I hope you understand that.

25:07.541 --> 25:09.000
How's the job hunting going?

25:10.208 --> 25:12.875
That? Absolutely awful.

25:13.916 --> 25:15.625
Is that right? Me too.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.333
How come?

25:19.958 --> 25:20.958
What do you mean?

25:22.708 --> 25:24.208
That's what I'd like to know.

25:27.750 --> 25:29.500
It's like no matter how hard I try,

25:30.208 --> 25:32.750
it feels as if our lives
have already been mapped out for us

25:33.250 --> 25:34.833
depending on family and education.

25:36.416 --> 25:39.333
That's not right.
I mean, you're incredible, Mayu.

25:39.416 --> 25:41.541
Don't say that. You don't really know me.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.833
Don't get mad.

25:47.375 --> 25:49.041
I'm sure you didn't read it,

25:50.041 --> 25:52.125
but did you see the Anna Matsuda article?

25:52.791 --> 25:56.458
Apparently, she's been attacking
the government out of a personal grudge.

25:56.541 --> 25:58.250
I feel betrayed by her.

26:00.291 --> 26:01.125
Yes.

26:02.958 --> 26:05.791
I read it, but it sounded like
a one-sided attack by the tabloid.

26:05.875 --> 26:07.625
But there were photos.

26:09.875 --> 26:11.541
It makes me think

26:12.375 --> 26:15.666
the Eishin Academy scandal is just fodder
to cause a change in administration.

26:16.625 --> 26:21.041
Like you said before, I get the feeling
everything is controlled from above.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.416
Sorry.

26:27.458 --> 26:29.541
I feel like I've been lecturing you.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.583
I think you're wrong.

26:39.708 --> 26:40.666
About what?

26:44.916 --> 26:45.750
My uncle,

26:47.708 --> 26:48.625
he didn't die

26:50.125 --> 26:51.875
as fodder for that kind of thing.

26:54.291 --> 26:55.125
What?

27:00.958 --> 27:01.916
The employee at…

27:04.958 --> 27:06.875
the Finance Bureau who killed himself…

27:09.291 --> 27:12.208
he was my uncle.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.500
Sorry. I'm going to go deliver these.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.250
RESULTS OF THE MINISTRY INVESTIGATION
WERE BLACKED OUT. #EISHINACADEMYSCANDAL

28:29.333 --> 28:30.875
SCUMBAG JOURNALISTS
LIKE YOU KNOW DON'T KNOW THE TRUTH.

28:30.958 --> 28:32.083
IT'S YOUR FAULT THAT HE DIED.

28:32.166 --> 28:33.750
LEAVE OUT YOUR GRUDGE ON THE GOVERNMENT.

28:33.833 --> 28:35.000
YOU SELF-SERVING JOURNALIST!

28:35.083 --> 28:37.375
YOU DROVE HIM TO SUICIDE!
THIS IS WHY THE PRESS SUCKS.

28:55.416 --> 28:57.166
MATSUDA…

29:00.750 --> 29:06.125
THE ARTICLE ON MS. MATSUDA'S JOURNALISM
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EISHIN SCANDAL.

29:06.208 --> 29:09.375
THEY SHOULD BE VIEWED SEPARATELY.

30:26.666 --> 30:28.166
Excuse me. Ms. Matsuda.

30:32.750 --> 30:35.041
I am Kazuya Suzuki's nephew.

30:36.666 --> 30:38.000
We met once before.

30:46.416 --> 30:47.541
Good morning.

30:52.125 --> 30:54.125
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

30:55.041 --> 30:57.333
So you're a university student,
Mr. Kinoshita.

30:57.916 --> 30:59.541
Are you job hunting now?

31:00.375 --> 31:03.041
Yes. In theory.

31:04.416 --> 31:06.375
Is there a kind of job you want to do?

31:07.083 --> 31:10.583
Not particularly.
I've been rejected everywhere.

31:13.875 --> 31:15.583
I couldn't get hired anywhere either.

31:17.750 --> 31:18.750
Well,

31:19.458 --> 31:22.708
why did you decide to become
a journalist, Ms. Matsuda?

31:26.583 --> 31:31.250
A long time ago, an article was written
about my brother in the paper.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.083
That made me really happy.

31:35.333 --> 31:39.333
After that, I had the vague idea
that I'd like to be a journalist,

31:39.416 --> 31:42.208
and this place gave me a chance.

31:43.666 --> 31:48.166
Weren't you interested in politics
and that stuff at first?

31:49.000 --> 31:49.958
Not in the least.

31:50.708 --> 31:53.041
Though it's probably hard to imagine now.

31:55.500 --> 31:56.500
That's for sure.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.208
Oh, anyway,

31:59.708 --> 32:01.791
you're probably wondering
why I came here, aren't you?

32:02.291 --> 32:03.125
Sorry.

32:03.625 --> 32:06.458
It's okay. Is there something you want?

32:07.333 --> 32:08.333
Yes.

32:19.791 --> 32:22.458
I read this.

32:24.291 --> 32:26.291
Is this true?

32:30.041 --> 32:31.708
Which part?

32:31.791 --> 32:32.958
All of it.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.916
A lot of it is inaccurate,

32:41.458 --> 32:43.250
but the part about my family is true.

32:49.875 --> 32:51.208
That's just like my uncle.

32:54.625 --> 32:58.625
I think a lot of it resembles
this current scandal.

33:04.375 --> 33:06.916
You spoke to my aunt, didn't you?

33:09.333 --> 33:10.333
Yes.

33:15.041 --> 33:16.958
I feel absolutely terrible

33:18.500 --> 33:20.916
that an article like this came out.

33:25.041 --> 33:27.916
Why do you go this far?

33:30.208 --> 33:32.416
I understand why you're critical of me.

33:34.416 --> 33:35.541
No, that's not it.

33:36.875 --> 33:39.125
I want to know
how you can continue reporting

33:39.208 --> 33:41.541
even after all the hate you get.

33:45.625 --> 33:46.666
That's because…

33:49.666 --> 33:53.458
there are no crimes
that should remain unexposed.

33:58.333 --> 34:03.416
I believe it is the job of a journalist
to give a voice to the voiceless.

34:07.458 --> 34:09.375
A voice to the voiceless.

34:11.541 --> 34:13.416
It doesn't usually go well, though,

34:14.625 --> 34:18.041
but that's what I'm always striving to do.

34:25.791 --> 34:27.958
Ms. Matsuda.

34:32.708 --> 34:35.458
I know this is a sudden request.

34:40.500 --> 34:43.875
Could you please speak to my aunt again?

34:46.708 --> 34:48.500
I want you to help her.

34:50.708 --> 34:55.333
I've always thought that politics
and everything in the world

34:55.833 --> 34:58.041
was decided by the people at the top.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.750
I thought that stuff
would never concern me.

35:02.958 --> 35:04.291
At least until just recently.

35:08.000 --> 35:08.916
But…

35:14.333 --> 35:16.250
now I want to know what happened.

35:22.833 --> 35:23.958
I'll go with you.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.583
Please speak with her.

35:42.791 --> 35:45.541
I'll go get us a taxi.

35:45.625 --> 35:46.500
Thanks.

35:53.041 --> 35:55.833
MAYU

36:12.625 --> 36:15.041
KAZUYA SUZUKI
DIED AT AGE 45

36:33.583 --> 36:37.958
TRUE REASON BEHIND
MATSUDA'S OBSTINATE REPORTING

36:38.041 --> 36:41.916
How is your brother's condition now?

36:43.125 --> 36:46.875
Well, he can't talk.

36:47.583 --> 36:49.208
He's basically unresponsive.

36:51.208 --> 36:54.791
His heart is beating,
but he's not the brother I used to know.

36:57.375 --> 37:01.833
What happened to this case after that?

37:03.375 --> 37:08.000
The police did investigate,
but no arrests were made,

37:08.833 --> 37:10.458
and the truth remains obscure.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.375
Will the same thing happen…

37:18.458 --> 37:20.750
to my husband's case?

37:25.083 --> 37:26.458
If things keep up this way,

37:27.791 --> 37:29.500
I'm afraid it will.

37:35.458 --> 37:36.458
Mrs. Suzuki.

37:39.750 --> 37:44.791
I am certain that your husband didn't want
the same thing to happen again.

37:46.500 --> 37:49.875
I want the world to know
your husband's wishes.

38:00.000 --> 38:00.833
Aunt Mayumi…

38:17.083 --> 38:19.708
I guess there really are people like you.

38:22.166 --> 38:23.666
These past few months,

38:25.625 --> 38:29.375
I've been hurt a lot
by journalists and people in the press.

38:33.291 --> 38:36.000
I'm sorry about the awful things
I said to you before.

38:37.791 --> 38:40.541
No. I should be the one to apologize.

38:44.416 --> 38:47.500
Can I show you something?

39:11.250 --> 39:12.541
We were ordinary.

39:13.666 --> 39:16.750
We laughed about
how that was just fine with us.

39:17.875 --> 39:19.416
That's the kind of couple we were.

39:24.125 --> 39:26.125
And thanks to this boy being around,

39:27.541 --> 39:29.166
we were truly happy.

40:06.875 --> 40:10.500
Ms. Matsuda, there's something
I want to give you.

40:32.625 --> 40:34.666
This is my husband's suicide note.

40:38.458 --> 40:43.000
He wrote about his feelings
when he was forced to alter the documents.

40:44.375 --> 40:49.291
There are also the names
of the other employees who were involved.

40:54.291 --> 40:55.333
Are you sure?

40:57.500 --> 41:01.291
Please find a way to make good use of it.

41:22.958 --> 41:26.166
BELOVED MAYUMI,
THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING BY MY SIDE.

41:26.250 --> 41:29.791
I'M SORRY I WAS A HOPELESS HUSBAND
WHO CAUSED YOU TROUBLE.

41:39.500 --> 41:43.000
THE TAMPERING OF DOCUMENTS WAS CONDUCTED
BY ORDER OF DIRECTOR-GENERAL MOURI.

41:43.083 --> 41:46.958
DEPUTY TERAI REWROTE THE DOCUMENTS
AND WE REPLACED THE ORIGINALS WITH THEM

41:54.875 --> 41:56.000
Mrs. Suzuki.

41:59.083 --> 42:00.833
I'd like to ask you,

42:02.166 --> 42:05.500
as the bereaved family, what would you…

42:07.500 --> 42:08.791
like to happen?

42:11.916 --> 42:12.875
I want to know

42:14.416 --> 42:17.083
what killed my husband.

42:18.958 --> 42:20.833
I simply must know that.

42:25.041 --> 42:26.041
All right.

42:36.416 --> 42:38.875
THE TAMPERING OF DOCUMENTS WAS CONDUCTED

42:38.958 --> 42:41.291
BY ORDER OF DIRECTOR-GENERAL MOURI

42:44.791 --> 42:45.666
What is this?

42:47.041 --> 42:49.083
Kazuya Suzuki's suicide note.

42:50.250 --> 42:53.416
It reveals that Mr. Mouri
and the Ministry of Finance were involved.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.125
Did you speak with his family?

42:55.208 --> 42:56.750
I have her permission as well.

42:57.916 --> 43:01.416
It is clearly worth
making an article out of this.

43:13.833 --> 43:15.375
No, we can't print this.

43:16.666 --> 43:18.000
Wait. Why not?

43:18.625 --> 43:21.583
Boss, this will be a scoop for sure.

43:22.625 --> 43:24.708
Matsuda worked hard to get this.

43:25.583 --> 43:27.083
-Please print it.
-No.

43:33.875 --> 43:34.833
This was given to me

43:35.833 --> 43:39.750
by his family with the intention
of exposing the government's crimes!

43:42.583 --> 43:46.875
That's just the one-sided story
of a single employee who died.

43:46.958 --> 43:50.291
Even so, there is value
in letting the public know about this!

43:56.291 --> 43:57.458
Don't tell me

43:58.875 --> 44:01.875
you're being pressured
by the administration, are you?

44:08.583 --> 44:12.541
Has the administration made
some kind of demand?

44:15.208 --> 44:16.500
Tell me!

44:18.666 --> 44:22.666
Upstairs is under some kind of pressure,
but I don't know any details.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.166
You're okay with that?

44:32.791 --> 44:34.916
I don't have the power
to do anything about it.

44:46.750 --> 44:47.833
I will

44:49.291 --> 44:51.416
continue to fight,
even if I have to do it alone.

44:52.291 --> 44:53.125
Matsuda!

44:54.916 --> 44:56.208
KUROSAKI
APPOINTED DIRECTOR

44:56.291 --> 44:59.166
You've done well, Kurosaki.

45:00.083 --> 45:02.875
No. It was nothing at all.

45:04.833 --> 45:08.750
At any rate,
you can tell everyone it's a promotion.

45:09.916 --> 45:13.541
Move on and keep up the good work.

45:14.791 --> 45:15.791
I will.

45:17.583 --> 45:19.333
Don't look like that.

45:20.541 --> 45:23.750
I know it may not feel good,
but it's an unheard-of promotion.

45:24.416 --> 45:26.583
I'm sure your family will be happy.

45:28.875 --> 45:30.208
Yes, you're right.

45:31.458 --> 45:32.916
Thank you.

45:41.375 --> 45:45.000
SHINJIRO TOYODA

45:46.625 --> 45:49.833
KOHEI MATSUDA FILED
A WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT.

45:49.916 --> 45:51.875
HE CLAIMED TO HAVE EVIDENCE

45:57.750 --> 46:00.500
Wow. It's bigger than I expected.

46:03.125 --> 46:05.791
-How many people work here?
-Around 200.

46:08.916 --> 46:10.708
CIRO is incredible.

46:15.833 --> 46:16.791
Mr. Murakami.

46:17.708 --> 46:18.666
It's been a while.

46:18.750 --> 46:21.083
Yes, it has been a while.

46:23.750 --> 46:26.500
Murakami, come with us
to the meeting room.

46:27.541 --> 46:28.375
Okay.

46:40.583 --> 46:41.666
Mr. Kurosaki.

46:45.333 --> 46:47.125
I'm Anna Matsuda of Touto News.

46:47.750 --> 46:50.333
What now? Hasn't the matter been closed?

46:50.416 --> 46:54.291
I have something
I want to show you, Mr. Kurosaki.

46:54.375 --> 46:55.208
What?

47:05.083 --> 47:07.083
BELOVED MAYUMI,
THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING BY MY SIDE.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.166
Mrs. Suzuki gave me her permission.

47:12.416 --> 47:14.291
She wants you to read it.

47:28.541 --> 47:30.958
So this is where you've been hiding.

47:34.750 --> 47:38.625
I heard that you've been
snooping around my affairs.

47:41.958 --> 47:44.083
Why don't you tell us about it?

47:49.833 --> 47:54.166
This scandal should not remain
hidden in obscurity.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.500
The characters and events
that appear in this work are fictitious

50:25.583 --> 50:28.083
and do not depict real life.
