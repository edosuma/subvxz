WEBVTT

00:03.445 --> 00:06.992
[Thor] Verily, Guardians,
victory is yours this day.

00:07.155 --> 00:10.166
Actually, victory is
yours, friend Thor.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.867
Drax has a point.
Your lightning powers

00:12.898 --> 00:16.257
singlehandedly destroyed the
Symbiotes that infested this comet.

00:16.351 --> 00:19.117
Oh, come on, Gamora.
I mean, we helped a little.

00:19.203 --> 00:22.054
Aye, Peter Quill.
'Twas your crewmates' wisdom

00:22.117 --> 00:25.796
in calling for the might of an
Asgardian that saved the day.

00:26.015 --> 00:28.367
Now Asgard awaits.

00:28.656 --> 00:30.960
Open the Bifrost, Heimdall!

00:32.383 --> 00:35.184
[squelching sounds]

00:35.710 --> 00:37.252
[grunts]

00:37.593 --> 00:41.140
What sorcery is this?

00:42.335 --> 00:45.273
We are so not taking
the blame on this one.

00:51.168 --> 00:53.570
[grunts]
Heimdall, stay back!

00:53.687 --> 00:55.137
[grunts]

00:55.554 --> 00:58.523
[Guardians grunting]

00:58.781 --> 01:01.492
You! So-called Guardians!

01:01.796 --> 01:04.257
What have you done to the
Prince of Asgard? [grunting]

01:04.453 --> 01:07.859
We have done nothing.
It is the Symbiote that attacks.

01:08.171 --> 01:11.546
Thor, use your hammer.
The lightning can destroy it.

01:13.124 --> 01:15.343
[roaring]

01:20.842 --> 01:22.842
[roaring]

01:23.318 --> 01:25.912
Thor has become corrupted.
He is no longer worthy

01:26.006 --> 01:28.514
to wield Mjolnir.
[grunts]

01:28.826 --> 01:31.225
Looks like he found
a pretty good replacement.

01:31.302 --> 01:33.186
[grunts]
[grunts]

01:33.529 --> 01:35.477
[roaring]

01:41.719 --> 01:44.086
I am Groot?

01:44.297 --> 01:46.328
A Symbiote as strong as Thor?

01:46.469 --> 01:49.203
Ain't much in the galaxy
more dangerous than that.

01:49.367 --> 01:53.219
Oh, man. We are so taking
the blame for this.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074

02:05.059 --> 02:06.825
[Venom Thor roaring]

02:06.861 --> 02:09.840
[grunts, groans]

02:10.064 --> 02:13.137
[roaring]

02:14.354 --> 02:16.699
[Heimdall]
My prince, stop!

02:17.090 --> 02:19.394
You are a danger to yourself
and your people!

02:19.480 --> 02:21.173
[roaring]

02:23.878 --> 02:25.934
[growling]

02:27.014 --> 02:28.447
[roaring]

02:30.895 --> 02:34.551
[grunts]
Apologies, good Heimdall.

02:34.809 --> 02:38.785
The parasite's will is strong!
[grunts]

02:38.918 --> 02:42.043
[Rocket] But my kit-bashed
cannon is stronger.

02:42.184 --> 02:44.527
We borrowed some stuff
we found lying around.

02:44.605 --> 02:48.801
You mortals dare wield the weapons
of noble Asgardian warriors?

02:48.894 --> 02:51.480
What? It ain't like
they was using 'em.

02:51.598 --> 02:55.176
[grunts] There is only one
weapon that matters this day.

02:55.410 --> 02:57.824
Mjolnir, to me!

03:03.824 --> 03:05.996
[roaring]

03:06.954 --> 03:08.809
It has taken him over again!

03:08.855 --> 03:11.051
[growling]
[all grunt]

03:13.605 --> 03:16.137
Symbiote Thor's heading
for the World Tree!

03:16.184 --> 03:20.309
If he taps into its energy, he could
create thousands more Symbiotes!

03:20.868 --> 03:23.035
[roaring]

03:28.659 --> 03:30.625
[hissing]

03:35.583 --> 03:37.833
That thing does not
get to the tree!

03:37.958 --> 03:40.427
That thing
is the Prince of Asgard.

03:40.544 --> 03:43.755
Or was, until you Guardians
brought this plague down upon us.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.191
We're trying to prevent a plague.
[crackling]

03:46.227 --> 03:47.993
[Quill]
Huh?

03:49.693 --> 03:51.638
[roaring]

03:52.557 --> 03:54.865
[all grunt]
[grunts]

03:58.832 --> 04:00.082
[both grunt]

04:01.465 --> 04:03.364
And failing miserably!

04:03.535 --> 04:05.325
Now drop your pilfered weapons

04:05.410 --> 04:08.293
and stand down while a true
Asgardian does battle!

04:08.426 --> 04:10.048
We will do neither.
[yelling]

04:10.084 --> 04:12.677
[blow lands]
[grunts, groans]

04:12.778 --> 04:16.029
Cease this interference!
Asgard will subdue its own!

04:16.075 --> 04:17.450
[yelling]

04:18.732 --> 04:20.060
[grunts]

04:20.529 --> 04:22.094
[hissing]

04:22.605 --> 04:25.200
I am Groot!

04:27.167 --> 04:28.834
[grunts]

04:33.409 --> 04:35.674
I am Groot!

04:36.914 --> 04:38.314
[grunts]
[screeches]

04:44.251 --> 04:45.817
[slicing]

04:48.852 --> 04:51.757
I am Groot!
[grunts]

04:51.854 --> 04:53.220
[hissing]

04:55.796 --> 04:59.249
Not so fast, slimey!

04:59.414 --> 05:00.480
[electricity arcing]

05:00.521 --> 05:01.827
[clanking]

05:02.352 --> 05:04.147
Aw, krutack!

05:16.050 --> 05:17.849
[roaring]

05:19.167 --> 05:20.729
[Drax]
You were incorrect, Quill.

05:20.825 --> 05:22.992
That thing did get to the tree.

05:25.297 --> 05:27.359
I am Groot!

05:27.442 --> 05:30.343
[Rocket] Symbiote spores?
What's that supposed to mean?

05:30.437 --> 05:33.007
[spores chittering]

05:33.101 --> 05:36.320
It means if you thought
one Symbiote Asgardian was bad,

05:36.500 --> 05:39.461
get ready for a whole realm
full of them.

05:44.924 --> 05:46.846
[roaring]

05:48.473 --> 05:50.065
[hissing, growling]

05:50.182 --> 05:53.150
[Heimdall] Your Symbiotes
are taking over my people!

05:53.255 --> 05:55.237
[Quill]
So, where are they going?

05:55.324 --> 05:58.284
Odin's beard!
They're headed for the Bifrost!

05:58.499 --> 06:00.362
If the Symbiotes
get into the Bifrost,

06:00.415 --> 06:02.667
they could take over
the entire galaxy.

06:02.746 --> 06:05.487
We couldn't stop one
slime-powered Asgardian.

06:05.541 --> 06:09.010
- How do we stop 'em all? [Heimdall]
- You will not stop anyone.

06:12.011 --> 06:14.962
Take this passage to the palace,
to the Chamber of Renewal,

06:14.987 --> 06:17.749
and awaken the All-Father
from his Odinsleep.

06:18.292 --> 06:22.502
Okay, I understood "passage to the
palace," and then not so much.

06:22.604 --> 06:26.502
Only Odin, ruler of Asgard, has
the power to destroy this plague.

06:26.616 --> 06:30.190
I will stop the parasites
from reaching the Bifrost.

06:30.558 --> 06:34.034
I am Drax the Destroyer,
not Drax the Awakener.

06:34.062 --> 06:37.784
I will fight at your side!
I am Groot!

06:38.029 --> 06:39.377
Very well.

06:39.429 --> 06:42.135
I suppose you two
show some battle prowess.

06:42.206 --> 06:43.948
For mortals.

06:45.768 --> 06:48.674
"Go wake up
Grampa Eye Patch." Huh!

06:48.751 --> 06:51.713
That all Heimdoofus
thinks we're good for?

06:55.494 --> 06:57.385
[chittering]

06:57.620 --> 07:01.260
[Gamora] Looks like you may get to
prove yourself sooner than you think.

07:01.507 --> 07:05.064
Symbiote spores.
I hate these guys.

07:06.791 --> 07:08.353
[clanks]
Flarg! Not again!

07:08.402 --> 07:11.283
Cover me so's I can
patch this thing up!

07:13.164 --> 07:14.730
[grunts]

07:15.767 --> 07:18.189
[grunts]

07:18.463 --> 07:21.463
How come you didn't use that
force shield generator before?

07:21.556 --> 07:27.246
[grunts] Because I know how
reliable your tech normally is.

07:27.383 --> 07:28.721
I'll show ya reliable!

07:28.750 --> 07:31.551
[clanks]
Aw!

07:32.454 --> 07:33.820
[weapon clatters]

07:33.856 --> 07:35.822
[chittering]

07:37.799 --> 07:40.111
Hey, no fair clumping together!

07:40.462 --> 07:42.396
[grunts]
[screeching]

07:45.401 --> 07:46.800
[screeching]

07:46.869 --> 07:48.767
[blows]
Got one!

07:49.924 --> 07:51.102
Just one?

07:51.371 --> 07:53.486
[screeching]

07:53.752 --> 07:55.720
One that didn't get back up.

07:55.971 --> 07:58.900
[Loki]
My, my, dinner and a show?

07:59.041 --> 08:02.369
They do treat the prisoners
well here.

08:02.584 --> 08:05.556
Well, if it ain't
the <i> clown</i> prince of Asgard.

08:05.674 --> 08:07.486
Whatcha in for, space littering?

08:07.664 --> 08:09.353
"Crown" prince.

08:09.591 --> 08:11.971
And littering Asgard
with Symbiote spores

08:12.064 --> 08:14.713
would be your crime, not mine.

08:15.010 --> 08:16.823
Loki, today's your lucky day.

08:16.908 --> 08:19.540
We're gonna get you out of here, and
all you gotta do is help us stop...

08:19.564 --> 08:22.434
One, two three... everyone
in Asgard, including Thor.

08:22.571 --> 08:24.955
Sound good?
[chuckling]

08:25.094 --> 08:28.447
Help you?
Surely you jest.

08:28.549 --> 08:32.299
[Gamora grunting] Do we look
like we're jesting, jailbird?

08:34.613 --> 08:35.933
"Jailbird"?

08:36.065 --> 08:39.549
Why, I'm as innocent
as a newborn babe.

08:39.681 --> 08:44.383
"Innocent"? Who stole the Cosmic Seed
from Asgard and blamed it on my dad?

08:44.513 --> 08:47.526
Who started a war with Spartax
and tried to kill your brother?

08:47.594 --> 08:50.862
And who knows what you did to get
yourself locked up this time.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.534
Are you implying
I deserve to be imprisoned?

08:54.823 --> 08:56.770
No, we're stating it outright.

08:56.839 --> 08:59.606
Mmm. Thanks
for the rescue offer,

08:59.641 --> 09:02.977
but I think I'll stay here,
safe and sound.

09:03.618 --> 09:06.513
Rocket, how many prisons
have you broken out of?

09:06.758 --> 09:09.313
Twenty-three.
Soon to be 24.

09:09.485 --> 09:11.774
And that ain't counting
the ones I've broken into!

09:11.907 --> 09:14.621
[hissing, growling]

09:16.829 --> 09:18.625
We are too late.

09:19.391 --> 09:21.946
[grunts]
[grunts]

09:22.831 --> 09:26.000
I am Groot!

09:29.404 --> 09:30.504
[grunts]

09:31.349 --> 09:34.568
You Guardians may
prove useful after all.

09:34.802 --> 09:38.712
Was that sarcasm?
I do not easily detect sarcasm.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.719
Fine. You win.

09:45.841 --> 09:49.615
Um, I don't suppose you could
tell us where to find Odin?

09:54.334 --> 09:56.401
Odin's on the ceiling?

09:57.172 --> 10:00.140
Aah!
Try upstairs, genius.

10:02.477 --> 10:05.766
[chuckles] He won't
appreciate being roused.

10:05.891 --> 10:09.709
Yeah? Well, old people get cranky when
you wake them up from their naps.

10:15.912 --> 10:18.771
Found the eye patch,
but no Grandpa.

10:20.822 --> 10:23.568
[gasps] Ha! He is
on the ceiling!

10:23.732 --> 10:25.832
[growling]

10:27.896 --> 10:29.696
Flarg.

10:29.833 --> 10:32.544
Now is where you say,
"This is bad," right?

10:32.810 --> 10:34.801
No. I think
you covered it.

10:34.929 --> 10:36.696
[growling intensifies]

10:43.805 --> 10:45.538
[grunting]

10:46.648 --> 10:48.682
[growls]

10:49.529 --> 10:53.429
[yells] Stupid Stop.
Stupid Asgardian batteries!

10:53.693 --> 10:55.722
[growling]

10:56.499 --> 10:59.069
Lightning.
Works every time.

10:59.761 --> 11:00.976
[growling]

11:01.085 --> 11:03.597
Except this one. Go!

11:05.701 --> 11:07.400
[grunts]

11:13.387 --> 11:16.926
Ow! Dude,
help us!

11:17.059 --> 11:18.411
Please!

11:18.447 --> 11:20.223
Why come begging to me?

11:20.261 --> 11:24.067
Don't you have the might of the
All-Father at your disposal?

11:25.687 --> 11:27.621
[growling]

11:27.952 --> 11:30.726
Not... exactly.

11:31.827 --> 11:34.044
[growling]

11:35.868 --> 11:37.801
Stay close to me.

11:39.251 --> 11:41.830
[pounding continues]
Interesting.

11:41.987 --> 11:45.121
So it appears you foolish
mortals do need my help.

11:45.157 --> 11:48.986
Score one for
the Prince of the Obvious!

11:59.171 --> 12:01.311
And I shall assist you.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.006
On one condition.

12:03.296 --> 12:06.109
When this is over,
Odin will grant you a request.

12:06.327 --> 12:11.616
You will insist he pardon me
for all crimes against Asgard.

12:12.965 --> 12:14.631
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.987
[chuckles]
So be it.

12:18.893 --> 12:21.738
What the krutack? You could've
walked out this whole time?

12:21.793 --> 12:25.095
Just since my brother and
adopted father were corrupted,

12:25.130 --> 12:27.831
making me All-Father.

12:27.866 --> 12:29.966
[growling]

12:30.712 --> 12:32.645
[chuckling]

12:41.919 --> 12:44.982
Why am I sure
we just got scammed?

12:45.458 --> 12:48.051
You wound me, furry pest.

12:48.201 --> 12:52.357
I do keep my word, particularly
when it suits my purposes.

12:52.466 --> 12:54.552
As you will now.

12:55.827 --> 12:58.975
Ugh. What were we
talking about just then?

12:59.577 --> 13:03.327
<i>Quill, have you found Odin?
Has he agreed to help us?</i>

13:03.553 --> 13:05.350
Um, not in those words.

13:05.561 --> 13:07.186
What words did he use?

13:07.327 --> 13:10.233
<i>[Rocket]
"Roar" and "screech," mostly.</i>

13:10.444 --> 13:12.413
I do not understand these words.

13:12.561 --> 13:14.241
A Symbiote got him, Drax.

13:14.358 --> 13:17.475
So, under the circumstances,
we got the next best thing.

13:17.592 --> 13:20.053
Well, the 34th next best thing.

13:20.272 --> 13:21.780
<i>Hello.</i>

13:22.092 --> 13:24.585
<i>Loki! What have you done,
traitor?</i>

13:24.694 --> 13:27.553
What have I done?
Just selfishly offered

13:27.578 --> 13:31.475
to rescue Asgard
from this plague <i> you</i> unleashed.

13:32.065 --> 13:34.327
[hissing, growling]

13:43.041 --> 13:45.205
[hissing, growling continue]

13:46.978 --> 13:49.877
Get to the Bifrost.
I'll cover you.

13:50.189 --> 13:52.142
Gamora, you won't survive.

13:52.306 --> 13:54.267
We're the Guardians
of the Galaxy, Peter.

13:54.384 --> 13:58.267
We make sure the galaxy survives.
Now go.

14:02.994 --> 14:05.995
[grunting]

14:09.142 --> 14:11.775
- [Gamora screams]
- Gamora!

14:12.971 --> 14:15.071
[roaring]
[yells]

14:15.107 --> 14:17.140
[screeching]

14:18.721 --> 14:20.777
Get inside!
[yells]

14:20.812 --> 14:22.212
[grunts]

14:22.247 --> 14:24.047
[grunts]

14:24.082 --> 14:26.884
[straining]
[grunts]

14:27.052 --> 14:30.516
[hissing]
Drax! Not you too!

14:30.813 --> 14:33.148
I am Groot!
[screeches]

14:37.028 --> 14:39.796
I am Groot?

14:40.698 --> 14:44.046
- Drax and Gammy got turned saving us.
- I am Groot!

14:44.280 --> 14:47.671
I know it's happened before.
So now we're gonna save them.

14:47.906 --> 14:49.827
Unless you got
a problem with that?

14:49.882 --> 14:51.140
[gasps]

14:51.890 --> 14:54.327
Heimdall, old friend,

14:54.476 --> 14:57.812
we shan't get far
under such dire circumstances

14:57.936 --> 15:00.343
unless we can trust each other.

15:04.124 --> 15:05.124
[grunts]

15:05.162 --> 15:07.002
[grunts, groans]

15:07.898 --> 15:09.515
Uh, what are you doing?

15:09.632 --> 15:12.288
He's double-crossin' us,
ya moron!

15:12.476 --> 15:15.820
Worry not.
I shall save Asgard.

15:15.923 --> 15:19.093
I will simply use the Bifrost

15:19.202 --> 15:22.640
to send all
the monsters to Midgard.

15:26.272 --> 15:29.350
Phew! Okay, then.
See, Rocket?

15:29.420 --> 15:32.139
Nothing to worry about.
Wait. Isn't Midgard Earth?

15:32.373 --> 15:34.670
Correct.
I get rid of them,

15:34.779 --> 15:37.881
and they destroy
your wretched world.

15:38.022 --> 15:40.631
I kill two birds with one stone.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.654
And you rule over Asgard.

15:43.717 --> 15:45.412
True. Three birds.

15:45.506 --> 15:47.631
[laughs, grunts]

15:49.041 --> 15:50.941
[grunts]

15:51.822 --> 15:53.525
Nobody messes with Earth!

15:53.705 --> 15:56.119
- Keep him away from the Bifrost!
- Aahh!

15:56.197 --> 15:57.525
[sword clattering]

15:57.681 --> 15:59.697
You dare?
[grunts]

15:59.845 --> 16:01.908
[grunting]

16:02.737 --> 16:06.524
I am Groot!

16:06.674 --> 16:11.611
I'm trying!
The d'ast thing's got no juice!

16:11.791 --> 16:14.298
And in case you forgot, there's a
ton of Symbiotes trying to get in!

16:14.322 --> 16:15.767
[clunk]
Ow!

16:15.900 --> 16:17.894
Stupid hammer!

16:19.322 --> 16:21.299
Wait. Wait! The hammer!

16:21.392 --> 16:25.939
Can't pick it up, but that
don't mean I can't use it!

16:29.040 --> 16:31.376
[growling, hissing]

16:35.479 --> 16:37.612
[roars]

16:40.193 --> 16:42.185
[thunderous thud]
[grunting]

16:42.850 --> 16:46.279
Rocket, whatever you're doing
with that hammer, do it fast!

16:46.350 --> 16:48.688
[grunting] [Rocket]
Don't rush me!

16:48.751 --> 16:51.282
Ain't like I mess with
Asgardian tech every day!

16:51.415 --> 16:53.610
Rodent, cease your desecration

16:53.665 --> 16:56.985
of Mjolnir at once!
[thunderous thudding]

16:58.001 --> 17:02.188
Heimdall, we got bigger problems than
Rocket tinkering with the hammer.

17:02.874 --> 17:04.251
[grunts]

17:04.555 --> 17:08.009
Heimdall, I am now ruler
of Asgard.

17:08.188 --> 17:10.970
I command you
to open the Bifrost

17:11.040 --> 17:14.095
and banish these interlopers!

17:19.869 --> 17:22.651
[grunts]

17:23.903 --> 17:26.559
A lightning cannon
will require a conductor.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.442
Not bad... for an Asgardian.

17:29.672 --> 17:31.684
[electricity arcing]

17:34.839 --> 17:38.620
Here comes the thunder!
I hope. [clicks]

17:40.045 --> 17:42.111
Yes! Finally!

17:51.890 --> 17:53.923
[grunts]

17:54.585 --> 17:57.960
Free at last!
To me, Mjolnir!

17:59.101 --> 18:00.291
[roaring]

18:00.663 --> 18:02.062
Aah!

18:04.555 --> 18:06.149
[Rocket screaming]

18:06.922 --> 18:08.805
[screaming continues]

18:09.644 --> 18:11.577
[grunts, coughs]

18:12.223 --> 18:13.522
[grunting]

18:20.433 --> 18:23.066
Whoa. [chuckles] What a ride.

18:23.284 --> 18:25.351
[Thor]
Prepare for another!

18:26.706 --> 18:28.277
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

18:28.369 --> 18:29.846
[growling]

18:30.081 --> 18:33.042
Forgive me for underestimating
you, Guardians.

18:33.183 --> 18:36.081
Let us stand together now
in glorious battle.

18:36.238 --> 18:38.675
Uh, is this the kind
of glorious battle

18:38.769 --> 18:41.354
where we all get taken over
by Symbiotes?

18:41.425 --> 18:43.472
[growling]
[thunderclap]

18:43.885 --> 18:45.190
[Thor yells]

18:46.300 --> 18:49.003
What vile beast is this?

18:49.089 --> 18:50.589
Uh, that is your dad.

18:50.690 --> 18:53.261
Odin? This will not stand!

18:53.349 --> 18:54.948
[growling]

19:00.273 --> 19:02.850
[groaning]

19:03.624 --> 19:07.538
Why? Why have I
been awakened?

19:07.631 --> 19:11.327
Asgard is in dire peril
from a plague of parasites.

19:11.413 --> 19:13.155
I implore you, Father,

19:13.256 --> 19:16.600
use your Odinforce
and heal your people!

19:16.764 --> 19:19.506
[hissing, growling]

19:24.979 --> 19:27.082
For Asgard!

19:44.994 --> 19:46.194
[groans]

19:46.219 --> 19:49.579
What now... [groans]
What happened?

19:49.735 --> 19:52.751
[groans]
The Symbiotes...

19:55.563 --> 19:57.618
Are no more.

20:00.639 --> 20:05.642
Loki, your treachery
grieves me sorely.

20:05.717 --> 20:09.107
It will be eons before
you again see the sun.

20:09.349 --> 20:13.920
Heimdall, as ever,
you serve well and truly.

20:15.998 --> 20:20.560
And, Guardians of the Galaxy,
you have displayed great valor.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.552
Mortal though you be,

20:22.737 --> 20:26.412
you represent the finest
of the Nine Realms.

20:26.834 --> 20:30.646
I hereby declare you all
friends to Asgard,

20:30.765 --> 20:34.584
and as such,
do grant you one request.

20:36.081 --> 20:40.576
I wish for Loki to be pardoned for
all his crimes against Asgard.

20:40.786 --> 20:42.052
Wait. What?

20:42.146 --> 20:43.987
[Guardians] What? I am Groot?

20:44.023 --> 20:46.890
Why would you make
such a request?

20:47.993 --> 20:50.561
[chuckling]

20:50.763 --> 20:54.031
[sighs]
Loki,

20:54.114 --> 20:57.607
I see your binding spells
are as strong as ever.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.498
[sighs]
Release the varlet.

21:07.608 --> 21:09.303
[Rocket]
"A bajillion units."

21:09.377 --> 21:12.687
All he had to say was,
"A bajillion units"!

21:12.846 --> 21:14.912
[Thor] Friend Rocket, is
there nothing we can do

21:14.987 --> 21:17.281
to ease your troubled brow?

21:17.541 --> 21:21.577
Well, long as you're offering...

21:21.752 --> 21:25.145
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
I love this thing!

21:25.270 --> 21:28.802
[laughing] Hey, Quill, we
gotta get one of these!

21:29.041 --> 21:30.583
Yee-haw!
