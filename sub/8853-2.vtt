WEBVTT

00:03.020 --> 00:04.890
Oh, yeah. For sure, dude.
Everyone's gonna be there.

00:04.960 --> 00:08.060
Yeah, we went to spencer's gift
and, like, spent, like, $60.

00:08.130 --> 00:10.100
So we are set.
We've got lights.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.560
Bring whoever you want, man.
We don't care.

00:11.630 --> 00:14.030
We're inviting everybody.

00:14.100 --> 00:17.740
I'll talk to you latro.
Peace.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.000
Big party tonight, huh?

00:20.070 --> 00:23.480
I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail.

00:23.540 --> 00:25.910
Uh, you should stop by, dude.

00:25.980 --> 00:28.380
Do you want me there or not?

00:28.450 --> 00:30.050
What is this?
This ain't <i>seinfeld.</i>

00:30.120 --> 00:31.920
I don't just <i>pop</i> in.

00:31.980 --> 00:34.420
You know what,
y'all!

00:37.860 --> 00:40.060
Let me know when that antivirus
finish scanning.

00:40.130 --> 00:45.530
Should be like 20 minutes.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.900
You guys ready to get weird
tonight or what?

00:47.970 --> 00:51.040
Fur sure.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.670
Ho-ho!
Lookin' straight grizzly.

00:53.740 --> 00:55.640
Bitch better have my honey!

00:55.710 --> 00:58.110
Oh. Ooh. Bear puns.
I like those.

00:58.180 --> 00:59.910
Dude, I can't believe
you spent your entire paycheck.

00:59.980 --> 01:01.610
On that jacket.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.210
Well, I didn't spend
my entire paycheck.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.450
I made $350 and carl gave me
a deal on the coat.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.620
$345.
That's good.

01:07.690 --> 01:10.090
That's a good deal.
So you saved five bucks.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.420
Way to go.

01:11.490 --> 01:12.620
Well, I invested my savings.

01:12.690 --> 01:15.030
In a little bottle of ipecac.

01:15.090 --> 01:16.590
It's the stuff
that makes you barf.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.230
Smart move.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.800
Basically
a get-out-of-work-free pass.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.400
Yeah, it makes you barf, dude.

01:21.470 --> 01:22.870
'cause nothing makes me barf.
It's weird.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.200
I've got a stomach of steel.

01:24.270 --> 01:26.140
Adam, scientists
developed that.

01:26.210 --> 01:27.910
It would make you vomit.

01:27.970 --> 01:29.970
- Because scientists made this.
- Yeah.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.510
Who believes
in scientists, dude?

01:31.580 --> 01:34.410
Let me give this
a little testeroo.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.210
Hmm. That's weird.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.280
Definitely don't feel
like barfing right now.

01:38.350 --> 01:40.050
Oh, wait. Ugh!
No, I'm barfing.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.450
Ugh! I'm barfing right now.
I'm not barfing.

01:42.520 --> 01:43.820
- Okay.
- Wait I'm barfing.

01:43.890 --> 01:45.560
Ugh! I'm barfing.

01:45.620 --> 01:47.630
Those scientists better check
their hypotenuses, dude.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.630
Oh, god.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.570 --> 02:03.070
Sorry, bro.

02:03.140 --> 02:05.210
Reading has never came easy
for me so...

02:05.280 --> 02:06.310
- That doesn't matter.
- Whoa.

02:06.380 --> 02:07.750
I need your help, guys.

02:07.810 --> 02:09.180
Dude, you are too drunk.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.720
To get your shirt back on.

02:10.780 --> 02:12.250
Stop it, dude.
We were having an ab contest.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.850
And I won.
Obviously.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.220
Chelsey niederdeppy's here,
okay?

02:16.290 --> 02:18.020
And I invite her
to all the parties that we throw.

02:18.090 --> 02:19.090
But she never comes.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.290
And she came tonight.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.530
Right. Awesome.
Who is kelsey nieder...?

02:24.600 --> 02:27.770
Chelsey niederdeppy, dude.
It's the third love of my life.

02:27.830 --> 02:29.330
- Third love.
- Yeah, third love, dude.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.100
You don't know third love?

02:31.170 --> 02:32.440
Think of it... it's like <i>shrek,</i>
you know?

02:32.510 --> 02:33.670
The first two are cute
and funny,

02:33.740 --> 02:36.740
But this third one
sucked.

02:36.810 --> 02:38.980
- Ha. Yours?
- No.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.980
Man! Let's do this
right now.

02:42.050 --> 02:43.210
Shortest to tallest.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.080
Make me look cool, please?

02:45.150 --> 02:45.980
- Course.
- Do my best.

02:46.050 --> 02:50.020
All right.

02:50.090 --> 02:51.660
Who are those old dudes?

02:51.720 --> 02:53.360
Can you touch your elbows
behind your back?

02:53.430 --> 02:55.060
Sweetie, no.

02:55.130 --> 02:56.360
Why don't you go get
1980s jock style.

02:56.430 --> 02:58.100
On those dudes, please.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.370
- All right.
- Thank you.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.570
Oohoo hoo, ders effect.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.970
Can I help you?

03:04.040 --> 03:05.900
Yeah, you can get me
another beer.

03:05.970 --> 03:08.870
Ha ha. Actually, we can't
because we ran out of beers.

03:08.940 --> 03:10.640
Ten minutes ago.

03:10.710 --> 03:13.080
So why don't you guys
tell that story walkin',

03:13.150 --> 03:14.450
Christopher.

03:14.510 --> 03:17.550
Ho ho ho ho!
Yeah. Slam.

03:17.620 --> 03:18.980
What's up, chelse?

03:19.050 --> 03:21.990
Fyi, jerk-off,
we lived in this house.

03:22.050 --> 03:25.960
From '88 to '92 so we've got
a lifetime party pass.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.760
You know the deal.
Beer it up.

03:27.830 --> 03:29.460
All right, I don't think
you get it, grandpa.

03:29.530 --> 03:31.230
- No?
- I swam varsity in college.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.570
I went 20 point
in the 50, okay?

03:33.630 --> 03:35.530
- Mm-hmm.
- I can fight without breathing.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.970
Yeah. And I tried out.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.300
For the high school
wrestling team.

03:38.370 --> 03:39.970
And guess what,
I almost made it too.

03:40.040 --> 03:43.070
But they said being a mascot
was more my skill set.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.580
go patriots. Right?

03:45.640 --> 03:47.710
So when you guys are 69ing it,

03:47.780 --> 03:50.320
Does captain caveman
crank it in the corner?

03:50.380 --> 03:52.450
Oho ho ho, okay.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.950
If we do this,
there's gonna two hits.

03:54.020 --> 03:56.050
Me hitting you.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.820
And kid rock's <i>bawitdaba</i>
playing in the background.

03:57.890 --> 03:59.060
Ders, you have that cued up,
right?

03:59.120 --> 04:00.460
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

04:00.530 --> 04:01.690
Clark, come on.
They want us to go.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.390
So we'll leave.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.330
All you got to do is make us.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.330
Don't you think
we would've done that.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.270
If we could have?

04:12.340 --> 04:13.870
I would fight them, dude,

04:13.940 --> 04:15.670
But they've probably got
old man strength.

04:15.740 --> 04:17.779
And I can't handle that.
Not now. I'm tipsy right now.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.680
Dude, I said 20 point
and they didn't even flinch.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.079
Phelps changed everything.

04:22.150 --> 04:24.780
Dudes, we were being jerks.

04:24.850 --> 04:27.950
These are guests in our house.

04:28.020 --> 04:32.060
Maybe we should bring them
something to drink, huh?

04:32.120 --> 04:35.390
Whoo! Flyin' in,
drinks for the girls.

04:35.460 --> 04:36.960
- Whoo.
- Sorry about earlier.

04:37.030 --> 04:38.230
We really got off
to a rough start.

04:38.300 --> 04:39.730
Yes, we did.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.200
And we think it's really cool.

04:41.270 --> 04:42.630
That you guys used
to live here.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.740
- Yeah.
- And, uh, this one's yours.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.740
May our <i>casa</i>
always be your <i>casa.</i>

04:47.810 --> 04:49.110
Yeah.

04:49.170 --> 04:50.310
What do you say we guys,

04:50.380 --> 04:51.710
Uh, do some jagerbombs, huh?

04:51.780 --> 04:54.280
Let's bomb this hospital!

04:59.250 --> 05:02.320
- Ah! Wha-wha!
- Ah. Whoo!

05:02.390 --> 05:04.220
You guys are... you guys
are all right.

05:04.290 --> 05:06.290
You guys are all right.
You're down. You're down.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.060
Very down.
Nice.

05:08.130 --> 05:09.760
- You guys feeling okay?
- What's wrong guys?

05:09.830 --> 05:11.900
Maybe we should clear
a little path here.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.900
- Whoa!

05:13.970 --> 05:17.300
Clear a path. Clear a path.
It's about to get graphic.

05:17.370 --> 05:19.600
- And stay out!
- Oho ho ho!

05:19.670 --> 05:20.940
Yes.

05:21.010 --> 05:22.340
So glad you guys
got rid of them.

05:22.410 --> 05:24.180
It was getting weird in here.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.010
Yeah, those are the kind
of parties we like to throw,

05:26.080 --> 05:26.980
Weird ones.

05:27.050 --> 05:28.750
Not like the lame ones.

05:28.810 --> 05:30.380
When we were in high school
together, you know?

05:30.450 --> 05:31.850
- You went to my high school?
- Yeah.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.250
We were... we went...
we went to high school together.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.950
She's joking.
Really?

05:36.020 --> 05:38.390
We saw <i>2 fast 2 furious</i>
together.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.390
I had that hilarious
seatbelt joke.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.130
There was, like, 30 of us.
I was like a row back.

05:42.190 --> 05:43.630
I had milk duds.
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.330
The lights went down.

05:45.400 --> 05:48.200
I went "hey, paul walker,
click it or ticket!"

05:48.270 --> 05:51.840
No, I mean, I don't
remember you.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.670
We should go.
That wasn't cool.

05:53.740 --> 05:56.440
No. No. What? Don't.
You don't have to go.

05:56.510 --> 05:59.210
Let's talk, uh, let's talk
clippers.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.550
You're a fan?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.710
Yeah, love the whole clip show.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.120
Got season tickets so...
Really?

06:04.180 --> 06:05.520
Yeah.

06:05.580 --> 06:06.850
Are you going
to the game tomorrow?

06:06.920 --> 06:08.320
'cause, I mean, if you're not,

06:08.390 --> 06:09.750
We would love to buy
the tickets off of you.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.020
Oh, no. I'm going.

06:11.090 --> 06:13.360
We should all go as a...
as a team.

06:13.430 --> 06:15.730
As a squad.
Oh, we can take my escalade.

06:15.790 --> 06:18.230
Everyone will fit in there.
You have an escalade?

06:18.300 --> 06:21.570
Uh, esv extended or ext pickup?

06:21.630 --> 06:22.870
Ooh, it's white
and really shiny.

06:22.940 --> 06:23.900
You should see it.

06:23.970 --> 06:25.540
Oh, no, I've seen it.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.210
I've built it, like, 100 times
on the internet.

06:27.270 --> 06:28.770
Oh, my god, this is gonna
work out perfect.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.540
So let's just go in my room,
grab some booze,

06:30.610 --> 06:32.440
And talk deets or whatnot.

06:32.510 --> 06:34.410
Uh, I'm sorry, the puke
is kind of burning my eyes.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.480
Let's just... let's talk
tomorrow.

06:36.550 --> 06:38.080
No doubt. No doubt.

06:38.150 --> 06:41.320
And what beautiful eyes
they are to burn, milady.

06:41.390 --> 06:42.890
<i>Hamlet.</i>
It's page seven or eight.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.320
I'm not sure.
Okay.

06:44.390 --> 06:46.160
Yeah, no doubt.
All right. No doubt.

06:46.230 --> 06:48.560
No doubt. No doubt.
You want a coat?

06:48.630 --> 06:50.390
You need some help walking
to your car or what have you?

06:50.460 --> 06:51.900
- Thank you.
- Okay.

06:51.960 --> 06:55.830
- I'll see you.
- All right, see you later.

06:55.900 --> 06:59.440
Ho ho!
Boom boom boom boom.

06:59.510 --> 07:02.410
What? What? What?
This is real? This is real?

07:11.640 --> 07:15.510
Gosh. We have to get tickets
to that clippers game, man.

07:15.580 --> 07:16.780
You know who's gonna be there.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.750
Yeah, my one and only
third love.

07:18.810 --> 07:20.950
Chelsey niederdeppy.

07:21.020 --> 07:24.650
No. My childhood hero
and season ticket holder.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.450
To all clippers games,
marc summers.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.560
Oh, <i>double dare.</i>
Slimin'.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.390
Uh, <i>double dare,</i>
<i>family double dare,</i>

07:31.460 --> 07:33.590
<i>Super sloppy double dare,</i>
<i>what would you do?,</i>

07:33.660 --> 07:34.530
<i>Unwrapped.</i>

07:34.600 --> 07:35.560
Do I need to continue?

07:35.630 --> 07:36.800
We can get clippers tickets.

07:36.860 --> 07:38.400
Montez.

07:38.470 --> 07:39.600
That guy, he's got tickets
to, like,

07:39.670 --> 07:41.200
Every show ever.

07:41.270 --> 07:42.840
Yeah. He went
to michael jackson's funeral.

07:42.900 --> 07:43.800
He had, like, fourth row seats.

07:43.870 --> 07:45.410
Uh-huh.

07:45.470 --> 07:47.140
He said he, like,
felt usher's tears.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.340
Guys, there's no way montez
is going to help us out.

07:49.410 --> 07:50.640
After we didn't invite him
to the party.

07:50.710 --> 07:52.080
He was pretty salty.

07:52.150 --> 07:53.910
Ah, damn it!

07:53.980 --> 07:55.950
We've got to get those tickets
somehow, you know?

07:56.020 --> 07:58.390
If we do, I'll have chelsey
right where I had her.

07:58.450 --> 07:59.790
In high school.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.420
- Nice.
- Where was that again?

08:01.490 --> 08:02.820
Like three lockers down
from me.

08:02.890 --> 08:04.160
We had to walk
around the corner.

08:04.230 --> 08:05.460
- Oops.
- Oh, no.

08:05.530 --> 08:07.730
- We're good.
- Where's blake?

08:07.800 --> 08:09.860
Blake! Let's go!

08:19.810 --> 08:20.940
I don't know
how we're going to get.

08:21.010 --> 08:22.710
These tickets tonight.

08:22.780 --> 08:25.480
Well, actually,
I have a pretty good idea.

08:25.550 --> 08:27.210
I'm going to give them a...

08:27.280 --> 08:28.980
I-I-I called them last night.
They're sold out.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.520
Dang it, you know?

08:30.590 --> 08:33.190
If I were to just plan
a little better.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.360
Wait. No.

08:35.419 --> 08:37.720
We'll go to the staples center
in the escalade.

08:37.789 --> 08:40.760
- I like it.
- Call in a bomb threat, right?

08:40.830 --> 08:42.059
The game will get pushed
for a day.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.500
Then we'll trick those chicks.

08:43.559 --> 08:45.170
Into staying at a hotel room
with us.

08:45.230 --> 08:47.500
Get real physical with them.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.140
So hard that they won't
even remember the game.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.300
In the first place.

08:50.370 --> 08:51.370
It'll be like dorothy.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.710
At the end of the <i>wizard of oz.</i>

08:52.770 --> 08:54.340
Instead of clicking heels,

08:54.410 --> 08:56.880
We'll be knockin'
boots!

08:56.940 --> 09:02.580
yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah-ah-ah!

09:02.650 --> 09:05.650
You're so scary.
You know that, right?

09:05.720 --> 09:08.190
My dad had a lot
of <i>penthouses</i> growing up.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.930
Clippers tickets.
Free free free!

09:14.000 --> 09:18.330
Clippers tickets?
<i>Ay, caramba.</i> Yes!

09:25.410 --> 09:28.170
Hello, amigo.
What's the deal?

09:28.240 --> 09:29.710
It's a contest
to win clipper tickets.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.850
And a gift card at jamba juice.

09:31.910 --> 09:34.180
You ever have that razzmatazz
with that immunity boost?

09:34.250 --> 09:36.950
Okay, sorry, um,
what's the contest?

09:37.020 --> 09:38.280
Whoever holds their breath
the longest.

09:38.350 --> 09:40.320
In that horchata tank wins.

09:44.830 --> 09:47.360
Can't believe you keep
your speedo in the trunk, dude.

09:47.430 --> 09:49.100
Yeah, well, never know
when there might be.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.730
A swim-ergency.
Ooh. I like that.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.370
Wait a second,
so what is horchata, exactly?

09:55.440 --> 09:58.340
It's like a refreshing
mexican lemonade.

09:58.410 --> 10:02.080
Oh. No, no, no. This is not
what I thought it was.

10:02.140 --> 10:05.180
Oh, my... smells like...
that smells like cat farts.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.380
That smells exactly like
a cat's fart.

10:07.450 --> 10:10.050
Your time to shine.
Physical challenge.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.550
I don't think I want
to do it anymore.

10:11.620 --> 10:14.220
Oh, come on.
You got this, boy. Yeah!

10:14.290 --> 10:16.260
- Let's go, ders.
- Escalade. Escalade.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.160
Escalade. Escalade.
Whew.

10:19.230 --> 10:21.330
Hey, hey, <i>como te llamas?</i>

10:21.400 --> 10:23.500
What's your name?
Anders holmvick.

10:23.560 --> 10:28.170
Ahai! Let's give it up
for andreas!

10:28.240 --> 10:31.470
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Andreas! Yeah!

10:31.540 --> 10:33.540
- Yeah!
- Andreas, let's go!

10:33.610 --> 10:36.010
oh, my god.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.110
20 point. Come on, bud.
You got this!

10:38.180 --> 10:40.750
- I never went 20 point.
- Suck it up, dude!

10:40.820 --> 10:42.550
My third love's on the line.
Let's go!

10:42.620 --> 10:44.420
She didn't even know
you existed.

10:44.490 --> 10:46.790
Did the world know
ludacris could act?

10:46.850 --> 10:49.760
- What?
- Huh? <i>2 fast 2 furious,</i> bro.

10:49.820 --> 10:52.590
He murdered it.
Start the clock. Start it.

10:52.660 --> 10:54.530
- Go, ders!
- What's the time to beat?

10:54.600 --> 10:56.860
Hey, you can't hold him under,
gringo.

10:56.930 --> 10:58.470
That's against the rules.
Okay.

10:58.530 --> 11:01.470
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy in love, anders.

11:01.540 --> 11:04.540
Blake, let's go!
What... what about...?

11:04.610 --> 11:06.610
Blake, you're my best friend
in the world.

11:06.670 --> 11:09.910
And I need you here
with me now. Let's go!

11:09.980 --> 11:12.410
Well, this is probably
the saddest day of my life

11:12.480 --> 11:14.080
'cause I'm not gonna know
what me and chelsey's.

11:14.150 --> 11:15.650
Little niederdeppy babies
are gonna look like

11:15.720 --> 11:17.120
'cause they're not gonna
be born, man.

11:17.180 --> 11:18.690
And that's on you.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.220
You're basically an abortion
time cop.

11:20.290 --> 11:21.820
Yeah, dude.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.590
Adam, you almost drowned me
this morning.

11:23.660 --> 11:26.260
Not that you could
because I can't be drowned.

11:26.330 --> 11:29.330
Drowned?
It's drowned'ed man.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.830
What's the plan?

11:30.900 --> 11:32.800
'cause I need
to meet marc summers.

11:32.870 --> 11:35.470
Dude, who cares? I'm trying
to ride in an escalade.

11:35.540 --> 11:38.300
Have you seen an escalade
up close?

11:38.370 --> 11:42.140
Let's just bite the bullet,
go ask montez.

11:42.210 --> 11:44.080
Don't you think
we should've done that earlier?

11:44.150 --> 11:46.380
But you wasted everybody's time
this morning.

11:46.450 --> 11:51.380
With your whole
"I can't get in horchata."

11:51.450 --> 11:54.620
Montez, that mustache
is looking good, dude.

11:54.690 --> 11:56.260
Sharp.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.860
Yeah. If I could grow that,
I would so that.

11:58.930 --> 12:00.830
Yeah. We're like
the mario brothers.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.260
You know what, just say it.
Y'all need tickets.

12:03.330 --> 12:05.470
'cause why else would you ever
come talk to montez?

12:05.530 --> 12:08.400
You never come say "hey, hello,
how was your weekend?

12:08.470 --> 12:10.400
Did you enjoy your son's
cello recital?"

12:10.470 --> 12:12.270
First of all, I do hope
you enjoyed your son's.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.470
Cello recital.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.540
I bet it was yo-yo ma-velous.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.680
But you mentioned something
about tickets. That's funny.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.280
Uh, we're in the market
for, uh, clippers tickets.

12:21.350 --> 12:23.120
If you happen to have some.

12:23.180 --> 12:24.780
And there it is.

12:24.850 --> 12:26.650
You know what,
I got your damn tickets.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.120
I want face value
and I gots to have.

12:29.190 --> 12:30.620
That bear coat.

12:30.690 --> 12:33.730
No. I will be buried
in this coat, sir.

12:33.790 --> 12:35.460
Okay, well, I need a favor.

12:35.530 --> 12:36.800
Name it. Whatever.

12:36.860 --> 12:38.430
All right, me and the old lady.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.930
Going to seaworld this weekend.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.730
To get our wedding vows
renewed.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.470
I need somebody to come over
and take care of her cats.

12:44.540 --> 12:46.870
You can come up after work
and pick up these tickets.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.840
Montez, pulling through again.

12:48.910 --> 12:51.580
Consider it done.
Cats sat.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.250
This zit cream is starting
to burn my face.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.120
That means it's working, ders.

13:01.190 --> 13:02.790
Blake, we need you
to go over to montez's.

13:02.860 --> 13:03.990
Get the tickets.

13:04.060 --> 13:05.760
Right now?

13:05.830 --> 13:07.290
The blue team's about to play
pie in your pants.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.860
For a sega genesis.

13:08.930 --> 13:10.400
Who cares?
Have you seen this whitehead?

13:10.460 --> 13:12.230
Can you please deal
with this reality?

13:12.300 --> 13:15.570
Okay, blake, here's the deal,
brother,

13:15.640 --> 13:18.100
Ders is looking like garbage
per "uzhe," right?

13:18.170 --> 13:19.870
And I'm in the middle
of a monster shave.

13:19.940 --> 13:22.110
It's totally ridiculous.
The follicles are this large.

13:22.180 --> 13:23.580
It's like a tootsie roll.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.250
And I need you,
my best friend in the world.

13:26.310 --> 13:30.150
Who I truly care about
on some real levels,

13:30.220 --> 13:32.720
To go to montez's
and get those tickets.

13:32.790 --> 13:37.820
for me.
Your best friend.

13:54.640 --> 13:58.510
Hello?

14:01.750 --> 14:04.420
Ho ho.

14:07.450 --> 14:11.690
Oh, yeah, baby.
Oh, yeah. Yeah!

14:21.170 --> 14:23.200
Yo, blake.
Which puka shell necklace?

14:23.270 --> 14:24.970
Classic? Shark tooth?
I don't know.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.870
- Did you get the tickets?
- I don't want to talk about it.

14:26.940 --> 14:28.470
What happened?

14:28.540 --> 14:29.810
Look, I didn't get
the tickets, okay?

14:29.880 --> 14:31.840
Look at me.

14:31.910 --> 14:37.150
Jesus. You saw dick,
didn't you?

14:37.220 --> 14:38.890
Didn't you?
Yeah.

14:38.950 --> 14:40.920
It was montez's.
And he saw me.

14:40.990 --> 14:43.760
And there was a lot of screaming
and running and I just...

14:43.820 --> 14:49.030
Shhhhhh. It's okay.
It's okay, bro.

14:49.100 --> 14:52.200
Who cares? Get in here.

14:52.270 --> 14:53.670
We've all seen penises.

14:53.730 --> 14:55.330
We weren't supposed
to see, right?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.040
When I was in the boy scouts,

14:57.100 --> 14:58.740
I accidentally saw
ryan coe's penis.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.140
On a canoeing trip.

15:00.210 --> 15:01.710
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:01.780 --> 15:04.640
I couldn't look at him.
He couldn't look at me.

15:04.710 --> 15:06.410
We were best friends, bro,
and we couldn't even be.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.010
In the same room together.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.020
You know why?
Why?

15:10.080 --> 15:12.220
'cause there was an imbalance
in our relationship.

15:12.290 --> 15:15.350
- So what'd you do?
- I found a balance, dude.

15:15.420 --> 15:18.020
I showed that kid my penis.

15:18.090 --> 15:21.660
And restored order
to the universe.

15:21.730 --> 15:24.130
It's called the boy scout
rule of "d"s.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.200
And it always works.

15:27.270 --> 15:30.000
You've got to show montez
your penis.

15:30.070 --> 15:32.200
That makes so much sense to me.

15:32.270 --> 15:35.110
- Right?
- Hey, how are the seats?

15:35.180 --> 15:37.240
Uh, actually, montez
wasn't home.

15:37.310 --> 15:39.380
So we just got to make
one quick stop.

15:39.450 --> 15:40.850
Before the game.

15:40.910 --> 15:42.980
It's here. Aha ha!

15:43.050 --> 15:46.220
The escalade is here!
Hey.

15:46.290 --> 15:48.920
Make sure he sees
the whole thing.

15:48.990 --> 15:53.490
I'm counting on you.
All right.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.900
- Hey, anders.
- Wow. Looking good.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.430
Oh, thanks.
You look really good too.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.530
She is a real beaut.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.170
What's the lip on these rims?
I'm not sure.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.570
Hey, so you excited
for the game?

16:04.640 --> 16:07.410
White's a little too boca
for my taste, but I'll deal.

16:07.470 --> 16:09.140
Uh, yeah, super ready.

16:09.210 --> 16:10.810
We just got to pick up
the tickets on the way.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.910
So we'll make the shoot quick.
The what?

16:13.980 --> 16:15.580
The photo shoot.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.560
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

16:31.630 --> 16:32.970
- Shotgun. Called it.
- Chelsey's with me.

16:33.030 --> 16:36.370
Chelsey's with me.

16:46.910 --> 16:49.350
Uh, is your dad home?

16:55.750 --> 17:00.420
Oggy. Nice kitty.
Come to daddy. I have a little...

17:00.490 --> 17:02.130
Okay. Okay. Let's go.
Go. Go. Go.

17:02.190 --> 17:04.460
- Is everything okay?
- Ha. Yes. Everything is fine.

17:04.530 --> 17:06.530
Everything went
totally normally.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.430
Drive the car, sweetheart.
I don't want to miss it.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.230
We will have fun.
Okay. Junior!

17:11.300 --> 17:12.800
Get my pistol!

17:15.310 --> 17:16.740
Man, I'm loving
these headrests.

17:16.810 --> 17:18.210
Neck support's unreal.

17:18.280 --> 17:19.710
Oh, does your neck hurt?

17:19.780 --> 17:21.210
Because I could rub it for you.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.210
No, I said my neck's fine.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.550
Can you not hear me?

17:23.609 --> 17:24.910
Because the acoustics
on the escalade.

17:24.980 --> 17:26.480
Are supposed to be peerless.

17:26.550 --> 17:28.520
It's funny how life works out,
you know?

17:28.590 --> 17:32.520
It's not every day you get
a second chance at third love.

17:32.590 --> 17:34.790
- What?
- Hmm? What?

17:34.860 --> 17:36.930
Blake, game's gonna be
awesome, right?

17:36.990 --> 17:40.430
Yes. Yes. The, uh, game
should be quite enjoyable.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.200
But, I mean, we're having
a pretty good time right now.

17:43.270 --> 17:46.640
And, uh, you know,
no matter what the future holds,

17:46.700 --> 17:48.370
No matter who wins or loses,

17:48.440 --> 17:50.840
Or if we even see the game...
maybe we won't...

17:50.910 --> 17:53.980
I mean, uh, we have had
a blast in the car today.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.610
I didn't get the tickets.

17:55.680 --> 17:56.680
Did you show him
the whole thing?

17:56.750 --> 17:58.280
You don't have the tickets?

17:58.350 --> 17:59.780
Why didn't you tell us.

17:59.850 --> 18:00.980
Before we drove all the way
down here?

18:01.050 --> 18:02.220
Yeah, well, I was going to,

18:02.290 --> 18:03.390
But I had to show montez
my penis.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.120
To restore order
to the universe.

18:05.190 --> 18:07.260
Then his little kid
is staring into my dong.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.320
And I'm, like, "take a picture.

18:08.390 --> 18:10.090
It might last longer."

18:10.160 --> 18:12.360
Okay, out. Everybody out.
We're going home.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.060
Wait, no, I didn't have
anything to do with this.

18:14.130 --> 18:15.170
Can I please stay?
Oh, I would.

18:15.230 --> 18:16.530
But you're a huge douche bag.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.140
And you smell like rotten milk.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.370
- Where is this coming from?
- Get out.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.970
I am so sorry about this.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.410
This whole dick thing
should've worked.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.870
I've done it personally
like seven times.

18:24.940 --> 18:26.210
So if you just let me explain...
Out now.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.780
Okay. Sure. All righty.

18:27.850 --> 18:29.410
If you just let me
explain myself,

18:29.480 --> 18:30.880
I could explain
this whole thing.

18:30.950 --> 18:32.720
You know?
Yeah. Oh, yeah? Really?

18:32.780 --> 18:34.080
It's a pretty funny story
actually.

18:34.150 --> 18:35.450
Oh, as funny
as your seatbelt joke?

18:35.520 --> 18:38.560
You do remember.

18:38.620 --> 18:40.920
Okay. Well, see you
at the reunion then.

18:40.990 --> 18:42.160
Who wears a puka shell
necklace?

18:42.230 --> 18:43.560
It's from high school.

18:43.630 --> 18:46.630
I was trying
to make you remember.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.530
Soul mates.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.910
So do you guys want
to hitchhike?

18:58.980 --> 19:01.140
'cause personally,
I think it's worth the risk.

19:01.210 --> 19:03.410
Shut up, blake.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.950
You ruined my life and now
you're no longer my best friend.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.050
Ders, you're in.
Can you handle this?

19:07.120 --> 19:08.080
Yeah.

19:08.150 --> 19:09.790
Oh, and by the way, blake,

19:09.850 --> 19:13.160
<i>Global guts</i>
destroys <i>double dare.</i>

19:13.220 --> 19:14.990
Okay, you're just saying that
to hurt me.

19:15.060 --> 19:18.090
Mike o'malley would kick
marc summers' ass, dude.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.200
I double dare you
to say that again!

19:20.260 --> 19:22.230
Mike o'malley would kick
marc summers' ass.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.130
Guys, guys, come on.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.900
Just... we've all had
a rough day.

19:27.970 --> 19:29.740
Ders is right.

19:29.810 --> 19:31.440
Blake,
you're my best friend again.

19:31.510 --> 19:34.480
Ders, you're out. Sorry.
Hey, buddy.

19:34.550 --> 19:36.850
I am loving that coat.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.150
Holy childhood dreams
come true!

19:39.220 --> 19:40.950
That's marc summers!
Marc summers!

19:41.020 --> 19:42.250
- Oh!
- Hey, I'm not kidding, man.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.350
That is one sharp coat.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.190
You... you... you really
like it?

19:46.260 --> 19:47.690
Well, it is one
of the weirdest things

19:47.760 --> 19:48.730
I've ever seen.

19:48.790 --> 19:50.190
And I have seen a grown man.

19:50.260 --> 19:52.360
Pull an orange flag
out of a giant nostril.

19:52.430 --> 19:53.830
- I remember that.
- Yes.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.870
- I remember that.
- I got to have it.

19:55.930 --> 19:59.940
Oh, for you, marc summers,
anything.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.500
But wait, wait, wait.

20:01.570 --> 20:05.840
Do you think maybe we could get
a tiny favor?

20:08.250 --> 20:09.650
And I guess
that's why they call it.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.710
The best taco in l.A.

20:11.780 --> 20:13.320
Hey, thanks for watching.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.150
Uh, before we go,
I do have a little message.

20:15.220 --> 20:18.250
For montez walker in california
if you're watching.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.890
Blake henderson is really sorry.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.060
About that weird thing
he did the other day.

20:22.130 --> 20:24.790
But there's something called
the boy scout rule of "d"s.

20:24.860 --> 20:26.530
And it's real.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.670
And that's what being a scout
is all about.

20:29.730 --> 20:32.300
Join me next week
when we unwrap the tasty pastry.

20:32.370 --> 20:34.440
Known as bear claws.

20:34.510 --> 20:36.240
see ya.

20:40.140 --> 20:42.150
Oh, hey, little montez.

20:42.210 --> 20:43.880
No. Uh, okay.

20:43.950 --> 20:45.820
Rule of "d"s, son.
What's fair is fair.

20:45.880 --> 20:50.890
Okay. Uh, ha ha,
just, uh, pull those...

20:54.830 --> 20:57.830
Hey, bill.
Nice.
