Yeah. They bring her out
for ceremonial occasions.

-Then, your voice

10:22.926 --> 10:25.363
is also a part
of the Federation?

10:25.407 --> 10:29.411

11:37.958 --> 11:39.350

11:39.394 --> 11:40.830
So, how are we gonna
play it this time?

11:40.874 --> 11:42.745
You want me to keep
the communicator on

11:42.789 --> 11:44.529
or do we need a hand signal?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.270
No need.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.750
This is what I appreciate
about Dever.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.839
He and I are on the same page.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.106
That's more like
a book than a page.

11:56.150 --> 11:59.109
And you said the same thing
about that gal on Argelius II.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.329
That was a misunderstanding.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.419
It was one time.

12:04.462 --> 12:07.117

One very entertaining time.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.293
How is being chased
by live phaser fire fun?

12:10.338 --> 12:11.774
Oh, good, I was worried

12:11.818 --> 12:13.471
you might show up
in a silly hat.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.517
[clears throat]
Yeah, I was gonna ask.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.955
It's for fly-fishing.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.392

Lieutenant Ortegas, Dr. M'Benga

12:29.096 --> 12:31.838
and Nurse Chapel,
you are officially checked out.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.361
Enjoy your shore leave.

12:33.404 --> 12:35.058
You don't have to do this
in person, you know.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.277
Only way to make sure
it's done right.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.497
Nice hat, by the way.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.457
Fine. I'll take it off.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.155
What do you two
have planned for shore leave?

12:45.199 --> 12:47.418
ORTEGAS:
Are you kidding?

12:47.462 --> 12:49.769
They don't shore leave.
They shore stay.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.683
M'BENGA:
Oh, right.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.773
The nickname.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.600
[clears throat]

12:55.644 --> 12:58.255
I don't know what I'm saying.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.910
I should probably go.
Chief Kyle?

13:00.954 --> 13:02.346
What nickname?

13:03.913 --> 13:07.612
M'BENGA:
I can't remember. It's, uh...

13:07.656 --> 13:09.223
"Where fun goes to die."

13:09.266 --> 13:11.399
It's stupid.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.401
