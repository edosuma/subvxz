WEBVTT

00:48.984 --> 00:49.984
Whoa!

00:49.984 --> 00:51.404
Yeah, that princess merch

00:51.404 --> 00:52.564
is, like, so cute,

00:52.564 --> 00:54.024
but for that price,
I'm, like,

00:54.024 --> 00:55.524
it better do real magic.

00:55.524 --> 00:59.104
That is funny
and a good point.

00:59.104 --> 01:00.564
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:00.564 --> 01:02.314
This one's spicy!

01:02.314 --> 01:05.104
Oh, my gosh, that is
the cutest price tag!

01:05.104 --> 01:07.484
Hey, monster!
You know the rules.

01:07.484 --> 01:11.024
Monsters ain't welcome,
so put the merch back
and get out!

01:11.024 --> 01:13.154
-Whoa.
-Shoo, shoo, shoo!

01:14.564 --> 01:17.524
Do you think I'd look cute
in this shirt?

01:17.524 --> 01:19.154
-Or...

01:19.154 --> 01:21.444
Hey, over there!
That goes for you, too!

01:21.444 --> 01:23.984
-Monster!
-Hmph!

01:23.984 --> 01:26.654
Oh! Prince Lucitor.
Sorry. Sorry, sir.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.864
Please don't incinerate
my shop.

01:28.864 --> 01:30.904
-Hmm.

01:30.904 --> 01:36.774
Circumstantial evidence...
Hmm, okay. Hmm.

01:38.444 --> 01:40.564
-No.
-Hey, Mom!

01:40.564 --> 01:44.064
You know how Mewmans
kind of keep monsters separated

01:44.064 --> 01:45.274
from the rest
of the kingdom?

01:45.274 --> 01:46.444
Yes?

01:46.444 --> 01:49.404
Well, I was
just wondering why!

01:49.404 --> 01:51.774
We keep monsters out
because monsters are dangerous.

01:51.774 --> 01:52.984
You know that.

01:52.984 --> 01:55.404
Well, yeah!
But no! No, no, no, no!

01:55.404 --> 01:56.944
Not all of them,

01:56.944 --> 01:58.774
and what about people
who aren't Mewmans,

01:58.774 --> 02:00.154
but also aren't monsters?

02:00.154 --> 02:01.444
Like Romulus!

02:01.444 --> 02:02.814
He has snakes for hands!

02:02.814 --> 02:04.234
Are his hands monsters?

02:04.234 --> 02:05.564
Heavens, no!

02:05.564 --> 02:07.484
He's on the Magical
High Commission!

02:07.484 --> 02:08.774
And what about
the Ponyheads?

02:08.774 --> 02:12.064
They're a bunch
of floating horse heads!

02:12.064 --> 02:15.984
No, dear, we've had ties
with the Ponyheads
for generations.

02:15.984 --> 02:18.444
And Rich Pigeon?
His kingdom is brand new!

02:18.444 --> 02:20.864
And he's a pigeon
with legs, Mother!

02:20.864 --> 02:22.484
How is he
not a monster?

02:22.484 --> 02:24.564
Well, dear, he's rich.

02:24.564 --> 02:27.694
I don't really see what that
has to do with anything.

02:27.694 --> 02:29.234
And what about
the Lucitors?

02:29.234 --> 02:31.654
I've seen Tom do
some pretty scary stuff.

02:31.654 --> 02:33.734
Somehow he's not a monster?

02:33.734 --> 02:36.024
Okay, and it makes
absolutely no sense

02:36.024 --> 02:37.904
that lizard people
are monsters

02:37.904 --> 02:41.564
but Lekmet, the giant
magical goat

02:41.564 --> 02:42.864
Too soon, Star!

02:42.864 --> 02:44.524
But what's the difference?

02:44.524 --> 02:46.564
What the heck
is the difference?

02:46.564 --> 02:49.104
Enough! Look,
I don't make the rules.

02:49.104 --> 02:51.564
The Royal Monster
Expert does!

02:51.564 --> 02:54.564
I'm sorry, what?
We have a monster on staff?

02:54.564 --> 02:57.604
Not a monster,
a monster expert.

02:57.604 --> 02:59.104
Dr. Jelly Goodwell.

02:59.104 --> 03:00.864
Okay, then I'm gonna
go have a little chat

03:00.864 --> 03:02.564
with this "Jelly Goodwell,"

03:02.564 --> 03:04.944
if that even is
her real name!

03:04.944 --> 03:07.564
-Fine!
-Fine! Bye.

03:07.564 --> 03:10.524
What am I supposed
to do with this cart?

03:12.234 --> 03:13.484
Jelly Goodwell!

03:14.484 --> 03:15.944
We need to talk now!

03:15.944 --> 03:17.864
Oh, you must be here
for the cheese!

03:17.864 --> 03:20.944
What? No!
Don't play dumb with me,
Royal Monster Expert!

03:20.944 --> 03:24.814
Oh! No,
I'm the Royal Muenster Expert.

03:27.444 --> 03:30.234
The Royal Monster Expert
is down the hall to the right.

03:30.234 --> 03:33.524
Okay! Thank you!

03:33.524 --> 03:35.314
Jelly Goodwell!

03:35.314 --> 03:36.564
Hmm?

03:36.564 --> 03:39.524
Wrong office. Sorry.

03:39.524 --> 03:41.104
Jelly Goodwell!

03:41.104 --> 03:44.734
And step... step...

03:44.734 --> 03:46.314
Excuse me.

03:46.314 --> 03:49.104
Pardon me, is this
Dr. Goodwell's office?

03:49.104 --> 03:52.444
Yes, I'm Dr. Goodwell.

03:52.444 --> 03:55.314
Ah, thank goodness!
Now, you listen up, Goodwell!

03:55.314 --> 03:58.564
The way we treat monsters
around here is outrageous!

03:58.564 --> 04:00.654
We have got
all these dumb rules

04:00.654 --> 04:02.564
saying monsters
can't mingle with humans,

04:02.564 --> 04:03.734
and monsters
can't go here,

04:03.734 --> 04:05.314
and monsters
can't go there!

04:05.314 --> 04:07.364
Oof! It's gotten to the point
where a monster

04:07.364 --> 04:09.774
can't even go shopping
for a pre-ripped T-shirt!

04:09.774 --> 04:12.314
Well, sister,
I am not leaving here

04:12.314 --> 04:14.864
until you agree
to make some changes.

04:14.864 --> 04:18.654
I've spent my entire life
studying monsters.

04:18.654 --> 04:21.734
Nobody knows more
about them than I do.

04:21.734 --> 04:23.774
I've even lived among them

04:23.774 --> 04:26.234
and observed
their behavior first-hand,

04:26.234 --> 04:31.694
and you are exactly the princess
I've been waiting for!

04:31.694 --> 04:34.654
-For years I've hoped
to find a royal

04:34.654 --> 04:37.234
who actually gets it.
The way we treat monsters

04:37.234 --> 04:39.984
in Mewni is,
well, monstrous!

04:39.984 --> 04:43.484
-Exactly!
-Monsters need to be respected.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.194
-Yes!
-And loved!

04:45.194 --> 04:48.364
-Yes!
-And their habitat preserved!

04:48.364 --> 04:50.984
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

04:50.984 --> 04:54.024
Excellent. Let me take you
out into the field

04:54.024 --> 04:55.984
and show you
what I've been working on.

04:55.984 --> 04:57.064
Let's go!

04:57.064 --> 04:59.444
Being a researcher
is awesome!

04:59.444 --> 05:01.864
These monster costumes
are great!

05:01.864 --> 05:04.604
Oh! They're
monster camouflage.

05:04.604 --> 05:09.654
Speaking of which,
we should probably go ahead
and apply our monster musk.

05:09.654 --> 05:11.234
Monster musk?
What's that?

05:11.234 --> 05:14.104
-Oh, that is nasty!

05:14.104 --> 05:15.864
What's in there?

05:15.864 --> 05:18.654
My own special blend
of various monster secretions.

05:20.484 --> 05:21.604
Bleh, ugh!

05:21.604 --> 05:23.314
Let's get going!

05:23.314 --> 05:26.864
First we need to go
through the Forest
of Certain Death,

05:26.864 --> 05:29.694
then across the Lake
of Endless Suffering,

05:29.694 --> 05:32.654
over the Dam
of Constant Sorrow,

05:32.654 --> 05:36.234
across the Bridge
of the Inevitable Hereafter,

05:36.234 --> 05:39.694
and here we are!

05:39.694 --> 05:41.774
Wow, sick treehouse, doc!

05:41.774 --> 05:43.154
Oh, no...

05:43.154 --> 05:45.194
It's not a treehouse.

05:45.194 --> 05:47.694
It is
my field research lab.

05:47.694 --> 05:49.364
It looks like
a treehouse to me.

05:49.364 --> 05:50.444
It's not!

05:50.444 --> 05:51.904
Whatever you say, doc.

05:55.484 --> 05:56.814
Oh!

05:56.814 --> 05:59.774
Dr. Goodwill?
Whatcha doing?

05:59.774 --> 06:02.364
Shh! There's
a herd nearby!

06:02.364 --> 06:03.864
A herd?
A herd of what?

06:03.864 --> 06:06.234
Monsters!

06:08.694 --> 06:10.364
Whoa.

06:10.364 --> 06:13.734
This hill features
naturally occurring
geographic formations

06:13.734 --> 06:17.024
that almost
look like buildings.

06:17.024 --> 06:21.654
The monsters
were clever enough
to use them for shelter.

06:21.654 --> 06:23.444
Amazing!

06:23.444 --> 06:25.364
Wait, what?

06:25.364 --> 06:28.864
Ooh! Ooh! You've got
to get a look at this!

06:28.864 --> 06:30.734
There's 011358,

06:30.734 --> 06:32.904
and he has
his offspring with him!

06:32.904 --> 06:35.234
Oh, hey, Buffrog!
You know him, too?

06:35.234 --> 06:39.944
I have been watching 011358
since he was a tadpole.

06:39.944 --> 06:42.104
I implanted a tracker
on his ear

06:42.104 --> 06:45.814
and have been keeping
close tabs on him ever since.

06:52.654 --> 06:54.364
Okay, I don't know
about this, Goodwell--

06:54.364 --> 06:58.194
the spying, the costumes,
the monster musk?

06:58.194 --> 06:59.864
Monsters are just like us.

06:59.864 --> 07:02.194
You don't need
all this equipment
to get to know them.

07:02.194 --> 07:06.814
Get to know them?
Oh, ho, sweet, naive Star!

07:06.814 --> 07:08.734
It's not so simple.

07:08.734 --> 07:11.904
When monsters and Mewmans mix,
bad things happen,

07:11.904 --> 07:13.654
usually to the monsters!

07:13.654 --> 07:14.944
Yeah, but that--

07:14.944 --> 07:17.234
I've devised
a plan!

07:17.234 --> 07:21.154
Let me show... you...

07:22.154 --> 07:23.314
Tah-dah!

07:23.314 --> 07:24.444
Ooh!

07:24.444 --> 07:25.904
Nice cartsmanship.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.314
Thank you!

07:27.314 --> 07:29.234
Aw, look at little tiny us
in the treehouse!

07:29.234 --> 07:31.404
So cute!
And the monster village!

07:31.404 --> 07:32.604
What are you planning?

07:32.604 --> 07:33.984
You see that wondrously

07:33.984 --> 07:36.404
mysterious structure
the monsters built?

07:36.404 --> 07:37.904
Uh, you mean "dam"?

07:37.904 --> 07:39.774
I believe it's some kind

07:39.774 --> 07:41.274
of primitive monument

07:41.274 --> 07:43.404
that they built
out of instinct,

07:43.404 --> 07:46.904
but no matter-- we simply
remove a small piece
of their structure

07:46.904 --> 07:49.404
to release
a gentle flow of water,

07:49.404 --> 07:51.484
which travels
down the chasm,

07:51.484 --> 07:54.524
covers the lowlands
around the monster
nesting grounds,

07:54.524 --> 07:57.194
and creates
a natural island!

07:57.194 --> 07:59.314
VoilÃ !

07:59.314 --> 08:00.984
More like a prison.

08:00.984 --> 08:02.944
I mean, how are they
supposed to get in and out?

08:02.944 --> 08:04.694
Well, they don't!

08:04.694 --> 08:10.024
It's guaranteed total
isolation from Mewmans!

08:10.024 --> 08:12.194
Shall I detonate
the dam?

08:12.194 --> 08:15.194
Listen, we can't just
go around blowing up dams

08:15.194 --> 08:16.564
and imprisoning monsters!

08:16.564 --> 08:17.654
That's crazy!

08:17.654 --> 08:18.944
Mewmans have been deciding

08:18.944 --> 08:20.944
what's best for monsters
for way too long!

08:20.944 --> 08:23.314
But I already did it!

08:26.154 --> 08:28.774
Ugh. Unbelievable.

08:28.774 --> 08:31.904
You know what, Jelly?
You doomed these monsters!

08:31.904 --> 08:34.734
You don't like
my explosion?

08:34.734 --> 08:37.064
It's not about that.
I thought you were different.

08:37.064 --> 08:39.364
But you're just like
everybody else here.

08:41.064 --> 08:43.024
No, no, no, no, no.
Stop complaining.

08:43.024 --> 08:46.064
Look, of course there is
bigger, better stroller.

08:46.064 --> 08:50.314
But you should appreciate
the one we have.

08:50.314 --> 08:53.234
Hey, Buffrog!

08:53.234 --> 08:55.984
Look, look, look!
Jelly Goodwell blew the dam,

08:55.984 --> 08:57.864
and now the water's
gonna come down

08:57.864 --> 08:59.864
and turn this whole place
into an island!

08:59.864 --> 09:00.864
What?

09:03.314 --> 09:05.774
Hey, Star,
it's not a problem.

09:05.774 --> 09:07.904
That's just
a little trickle of water,

09:07.904 --> 09:10.104
nothing we haven't
seen before.

09:10.104 --> 09:14.064
Oh, you must be crazy dirty lady
that watches us through trees.

09:14.064 --> 09:16.234
Hello. I am
Yvgeny Bulgolubuff.

09:16.234 --> 09:19.654
Well, I'm Jelly Goodwell!
Oh-ho-ho!

09:24.234 --> 09:27.864
Oh, I'm such
a turd-brain!

09:27.864 --> 09:32.024
I shook your hand
with the blower-upper thing!

09:32.024 --> 09:34.064
No! It's too much water!

09:34.064 --> 09:36.104
It won't create an island.

09:36.104 --> 09:38.154
This will destroy
entire village!

09:38.154 --> 09:39.234
Come on.

09:44.694 --> 09:45.814
Incoming!

09:45.814 --> 09:46.904
Oh, my goodness!

09:46.904 --> 09:48.104
Come on, move it!

09:48.104 --> 09:49.314
This is not drill.

09:49.314 --> 09:51.104
Hey, hey!

09:51.104 --> 09:52.154
Hah!

09:58.944 --> 10:00.774
Hey, Star!

10:00.774 --> 10:02.104
Incredible!

10:02.104 --> 10:05.904
Mewmans and monsters
working together!

10:07.484 --> 10:09.154
-Here it comes!
-Oh, no!

10:09.154 --> 10:10.694
-Hey!

10:10.694 --> 10:12.864
-Grab a rock!
-Oh!

10:12.864 --> 10:13.984
Great, let's go!

10:13.984 --> 10:15.444
Oh! Okay!

10:21.024 --> 10:25.404
Yay!

10:25.404 --> 10:29.404
How could I have been
such a dumb

10:29.404 --> 10:33.024
Here I thought
we should live separately!

10:33.024 --> 10:37.564
But really Mewmans
should live like monsters!

10:37.564 --> 10:39.154
Hah-hah!

10:39.154 --> 10:43.564
Play in the mud!
Act like idiots! Oh!

10:43.564 --> 10:45.604
I'm a monster, ho-whah!

10:45.604 --> 10:48.944
I'm a monster!

10:55.154 --> 10:56.814
There!

10:56.814 --> 10:59.984
Now Mewni has
a real monster expert.

10:59.984 --> 11:01.404
Thank you.

11:01.404 --> 11:03.774
Aw, you're crying.

11:03.774 --> 11:05.734
Oh, the badge.

11:05.734 --> 11:08.984
I think you broke
the skin a little.

11:08.984 --> 11:10.984
Oh, gosh!
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

11:10.984 --> 11:13.024
Yeah, yes.

11:14.154 --> 11:15.154
âª She's a princess âª

11:15.154 --> 11:16.524
âª Winning battles âª

11:16.524 --> 11:19.814
âª Through the break of dawn âª

11:19.814 --> 11:21.604
âª Don't worry
when it's night âª

11:21.604 --> 11:24.864
âª 'Cause she would keep
the lights on âª

11:24.864 --> 11:30.984
âª Oh, there goes
a shining star âª

11:30.984 --> 11:33.234
âª Evil won't deter her âª

11:33.234 --> 11:37.024
âª 'Cause magic
flows through her âª
