10:11.698 --> 10:13.047
Gerry-boy.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.527
Whoa, when I said bring me
a delicious snack,

10:15.571 --> 10:18.052
I meant food, but...
I'll take this, as well.

10:18.095 --> 10:21.577
Uncle Oscar,
this is Tani, a friend.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.927
I know from personal experience
she does not respond

10:23.971 --> 10:25.320
to talk like that.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.191
OSCAR:
So sorry, please, forgive me.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.324
May I present
my soon-to-be fiancée

10:29.367 --> 10:31.021
Therese?
Oh, stop it.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.806
I keep telling you
I'm already married.

10:32.849 --> 10:33.850
Hmm.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.635
You're already married?Mm-hmm.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.854
May I see your hand?

10:37.898 --> 10:39.334
I don't see a ring.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.857
Do you see a ring?
I don't see a ring.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.076
Where's your ring?

10:42.119 --> 10:43.468
What? I was wearing it.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.775
Therese...

10:45.819 --> 10:47.168
my darling...

10:47.211 --> 10:48.212
will you marry me?

10:48.256 --> 10:49.257
Please say yes.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.345
THERESE:
How did you get this

10:50.388 --> 10:51.607
off of my finger?

10:51.651 --> 10:54.436
You better watch yourselves
around this one.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.133
[chuckling]

10:56.177 --> 10:58.483
Uncle Oscar, um,
we wanted to ask you

10:58.527 --> 11:00.921
about your, uh, move to Seattle.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.792
1978, right?

11:02.836 --> 11:04.620
Mm.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.361
Um, what prompted you to leave?

11:06.404 --> 11:08.929
There's no state income tax
in Washington.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.323
So, nothing drove you
to leave Hawaii?

11:12.367 --> 11:16.458
Um, just your average
wanderlust.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.810
Yeah, hmm.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.986
You weren't in
any kind of trouble?

11:23.030 --> 11:25.685
[monitor beeping rapidly]

11:26.729 --> 11:29.471
OSCAR:
Trouble? Um, no.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.995
What kind of trouble, uh...?

11:32.039 --> 11:33.344
THERESE:
I'm sorry, you two.

11:33.388 --> 11:34.824
His heart rate
is spiking.

11:34.868 --> 11:35.999
You better go lie down.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.609
Ah.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.524
Sure. Thanks, Oscar.

11:39.568 --> 11:40.656
Yeah.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.527
See you in a minute.

11:42.571 --> 11:43.659
Yeah. Sure, Ger.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.359
That doesn't make me feel
like your uncle's innocent,

11:48.403 --> 11:50.057
but with the
heart condition,

11:50.100 --> 11:51.841
agitating him
could be dangerous,

11:51.885 --> 11:53.495
so let's get
the facts first.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.497
Okay.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.542
GROVER:
Look who showed up to work.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.457
Yo, what's up?
Good to see you, brother.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.720
Good to be back,
brother.

12:00.763 --> 12:01.764
Hey.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.160
What we got?All right, so,

12:06.203 --> 12:08.379
HPD found
Greg and Cynthia's rental car

12:08.423 --> 12:10.468
a few miles
from the crime scene.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.079
Luggage was missing,
the car was wiped clean,

12:12.122 --> 12:14.777
but it has the same M.O.
as the other rentals they hit.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.344
Except they took a body
this time.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.867
Got to be a
reason for that.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.347
Maybe the guy was trying
to defend his wife,

12:19.390 --> 12:20.740
fought back, and they
had to put him down.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.351
That doesn't explain
what happened to the wife.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.874
Well, what if this was
a targeted kidnapping?

12:24.918 --> 12:26.223
I mean, these guys
take advantage

12:26.267 --> 12:28.791
of the highly publicized
Fix-a-Flat robberies,

12:28.835 --> 12:30.793
use that as cover
to kidnap Cynthia.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.795
Uh, we reached out
to her family,

12:32.839 --> 12:34.492
and they haven't gotten
any ransom demands.

12:34.536 --> 12:35.885
STEVE:
Either way,
we got to find this woman.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.408
Junior, why don't you get
some more search teams

12:37.452 --> 12:39.106
down to the scene
and widen the search parameter.

12:39.149 --> 12:41.369
If she got away on foot,
she could still be out there.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.675
Sir.
Lou, Adam,
want you to pull

12:43.719 --> 12:45.112
all previous
Fix-a-Flat robbery case files.

12:45.155 --> 12:48.115
We got to ID these perps.
We got to do it right now.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.775
TANI:
We found it during
an investigation.

12:55.818 --> 12:56.993
Unfortunately,
it's still ongoing,

12:57.037 --> 12:58.778
so we can't reveal
any further details.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.825
HIRSCH:
Something wrong,
Ms. May?

13:02.869 --> 13:04.261
We thought you'd be
thrilled to have

13:04.305 --> 13:05.741
such a valuable
item returned.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.916
Oh, no.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.309
Of course I am.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.658
And thank you.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.094
But to be honest,

13:11.138 --> 13:15.533
this is a very painful reminder
of a very difficult time

13:15.577 --> 13:16.752
in my life.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.146
My housekeeper
was murdered,

13:19.189 --> 13:24.934
and I was betrayed
by someone very dear to me.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.024
Your fiancé Jay Gilbert.[chuckles]

13:28.068 --> 13:30.113
So you did your homework.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.115
We read that article from '78.

13:32.159 --> 13:35.205
Well, here's something
that didn't make the papers:

13:35.249 --> 13:38.121
I never recovered from that.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.863
Never learned
to trust again.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.735
Well, I can't imagine
what that must have felt like,

13:43.779 --> 13:46.042
to be taken advantage of
in that way.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.784
Well, worse than that
was that I found out

13:48.828 --> 13:50.525
I wasn't the only one.

13:50.568 --> 13:53.833
The detectives who were
handling the case told me

13:53.876 --> 13:56.487
they found someone
who fit his description.

13:56.531 --> 14:01.144
He had pulled the same con
on four other women before me.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.060
Who knows how many after?

14:04.104 --> 14:07.585
He was my one true love.

14:09.370 --> 14:13.243
But to him... [chuckles]

14:13.287 --> 14:15.724
I was just a mark.

14:17.421 --> 14:20.685
Here's everything HPD has
on these Fix-a-Flat Robbers,

14:20.729 --> 14:23.079
including police sketches based
on witnesses' descriptions.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.125
But we don't have any IDs yet

14:25.168 --> 14:26.561
on Bronytail here
or his partner.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.216
And no pattern to where
they choose to strike.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.305
Times, locations, even
the rental companies they target

14:31.348 --> 14:32.741
vary from robbery to robbery.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.917
All right, so they're just
choosing cars randomly.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.527
Yeah, but HPD
canvassed

14:36.571 --> 14:38.878
the rental car lots
with those sketches

14:38.921 --> 14:40.880
and dug through a mountain
of security footage.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.229
These robbers were
never spotted

14:42.272 --> 14:44.013
on the premises of
any of the companies.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.320
They had help.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.408
Sure.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.888
STEVE:
I mean, somebody
who can access

14:48.931 --> 14:51.325
multiple car rental lots
without seeming out of place.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.196
Could be a mechanic or, uh,

14:53.240 --> 14:55.895
someone who works for a...
a car wash service?

14:55.938 --> 14:57.418
Those companies usually have
their own employees.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.378
What about airport buses?

15:01.422 --> 15:02.597
Think about it-- uh,

15:02.640 --> 15:03.903
Honolulu International,
they have shuttles

15:03.946 --> 15:05.730
that access multiple
car rental lots.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.472
And all the drivers would
have access to all the lots.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.474
All right, let's pull up
HNL employment records,

15:10.518 --> 15:11.911
see what we find.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.478
♪

15:16.828 --> 15:18.874
JUNIOR:
All right, we're searching
for Cynthia Dean.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.658
She's blonde,
five-six, 110 pounds.

we got something.[dog barking]

in Quad Four.

Come on, Cynthia, stay with me.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.996

15:54.040 --> 15:55.911
That should do it.

Well, here, for your trouble.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.654

just take it all.

cell phones now!

16:00.916 --> 16:02.439
The keys to the rental.

16:03.788 --> 16:04.876

16:04.920 --> 16:06.617
No, please.Let her keep the ring.

16:06.661 --> 16:07.879
Hand it over now!

to be a hero!

16:18.847 --> 16:22.894
And then I ran
straight to the woods.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.070
I could hear them firing,

16:24.113 --> 16:25.375
and I just kept going.

16:25.419 --> 16:26.768
I don't think
I realized

16:26.811 --> 16:29.510
that I was hit
until the shots stopped.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.033
And I-I tried
to keep moving,

16:31.077 --> 16:33.079
and I-I started to feel faint.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.124
And then, next thing I remember

16:35.168 --> 16:37.083
is waking up
in this hospital bed.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.041
All right, Cynthia,
I'm gonna show you

16:39.085 --> 16:40.956
a composite sketch.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.784
Are these the guys
who attacked you?

16:42.827 --> 16:44.394
Him.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.007
That's who killed my husband.

16:53.316 --> 16:54.970
Hey, Cap.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.451
I thought I was getting pretty
good at reading you, but, uh,

16:57.494 --> 17:00.541
what was going on with you when
Cynthia was telling her story?

17:00.584 --> 17:03.283
I'm not sure I buy
that grieving widow story.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.546
These guys had a really
good scam going.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.982
Why would they risk
getting hemmed up

17:07.026 --> 17:08.723
on a murder beef
over a wedding ring?

17:10.116 --> 17:11.726
Doesn't add up.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.471
All right.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.473
So, this looks
like all the notes

17:19.516 --> 17:20.909
and documents from
the detective

17:20.952 --> 17:23.129
about the robbery/homicide
at Tabitha's.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.131
Including crime scene photos.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.481
Oh.

17:27.524 --> 17:30.005
Right through the eye?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.920
That's gonna be hard to unsee.

17:31.963 --> 17:36.055
There is no way Uncle Oscar
could do something that brutal.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.840
Well, it looks like Jay Gilbert
was the prime suspect.

17:38.883 --> 17:41.321
And look at this--
there's a whole section

17:41.364 --> 17:42.887
dedicated to the four other cons

17:42.931 --> 17:45.020
that Tabitha was
telling us about.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.587
The detectives
dubbed him

17:46.630 --> 17:48.110
the "Casanova Conman"

17:48.154 --> 17:51.157
because he romanced the women
before he robbed them.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.767
Just like every other
relationship.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.160
Smooth sailing.

17:54.203 --> 17:57.772
Oh, don't tell me there's
trouble in paradise already.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.035
[sighs]

18:00.079 --> 18:02.646
Junior and I got into
our first fight.

18:02.690 --> 18:05.214
It was more like
a tiff, really.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.042
Actually, I don't
know what it was.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.478
Well, what happened exactly?

18:09.523 --> 18:11.002
He made me breakfast.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.265
That monster.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.267
Okay, listen,
relationships

18:14.310 --> 18:17.357
are more like a marathon
than a sprint.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.882
But it's okay to stumble
over those early hurdles.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.144
There are no hurdles
in marathons.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.450
Okay, okay,
just stay with me here.

18:23.493 --> 18:26.540
You just have to get
through those hurdles,

18:26.583 --> 18:29.151
just say sorry a-and move on.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.761
Yeah.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.502
Right, yeah, I know that.
[chuckles]

18:33.590 --> 18:35.114
I'm supposed to be
helping you here,

18:35.157 --> 18:37.203
not the other way around,
so why don't we, uh,

18:37.246 --> 18:38.639
just put the couples
therapy aside

18:38.682 --> 18:40.510
and focus on your
uncle, shall we?

18:40.554 --> 18:43.209
Okay, this is the inventory
from all the items

18:43.252 --> 18:44.993
that Oscar stole
from the heiresses.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.125
Okay.

18:46.168 --> 18:49.563
Snuffbox,
some first-edition books.

18:49.606 --> 18:52.261
So, clearly, Uncle Oscar

18:52.305 --> 18:55.003
made some bad choices
with these women,

18:55.046 --> 18:58.049
but it is possible
that someone else

18:58.093 --> 19:00.226
killed Tabitha's housekeeper.

19:00.269 --> 19:03.577
Well, the slug that killed her
was a .256 Winchester Magnum.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.231
That's really rare.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.233
And if you look
at the evidence list...

19:07.276 --> 19:09.235
a custom-engraved pistol

19:09.278 --> 19:12.063
stolen from heiress number two,
Lindsay Harp.

19:12.107 --> 19:14.936
And this requires
that exact same rare ammunition.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.939
Okay, so they think
the Casanova Conman

19:17.982 --> 19:20.115
used the gun he stole
from one heiress

19:20.159 --> 19:22.117
in the robbery of another?Hirsch...

19:22.161 --> 19:24.946
it's really looking
like your uncle did this.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.904

These items-- the crystal,
the, uh, first-edition books--

19:36.000 --> 19:38.786
they have to be sold in
a specialized market, right?

19:38.829 --> 19:43.007
Now, Uncle Oscar had a roommate
at the time named Stanley.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.619
Guy was an "antiques dealer,"

19:45.662 --> 19:48.926
but he sometimes moved goods
that, uh...

19:48.970 --> 19:50.928
lacked proper certification.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.016
Right, he was a fence.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.279
Yes. A fence.

19:53.322 --> 19:56.456
So, what if he fenced
the pistol for Oscar

19:56.499 --> 19:57.805
before the murder?

19:57.848 --> 19:59.459
That would exonerate Oscar,
right?

19:59.502 --> 20:00.677
Maybe.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.636
But are you really
telling me you believe

20:02.679 --> 20:04.725
that your uncle had no
part in this murder?

20:04.768 --> 20:06.466
T-Truthfully,
I-I'm not sure of anything.

20:06.509 --> 20:10.600

25:36.143 --> 25:37.797

it's also safe

25:37.840 --> 25:40.277
to assume that Greg and Cynthia
have a contact on this island.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.150

what's going on,

25:45.152 --> 25:47.633
then they use the GPS tracker
to locate the suitcase.

off to go fence the merchandise.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.641

that would mean that Oscar

26:19.969 --> 26:23.233

murder weapon that night.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.495

who taught me how to run cons.

26:32.982 --> 26:34.636
When my father
was too busy

26:34.680 --> 26:37.987

Watches, jewelry, art.

26:51.218 --> 26:52.741
He stole 'em,
I sold 'em.

fifty-fifty.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.287
With the ivory inlay?

27:17.331 --> 27:18.637
Hmm.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.942
That would have fetched
a pretty penny.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.988
But Oscar wouldn't part with it.

27:22.031 --> 27:23.337
TANI:
You obviously knew

27:23.380 --> 27:25.034
that he was scamming
these heiresses.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.949
Do you remember a Tabitha May?

27:26.993 --> 27:30.387
He told me about
the antique snuffbox she had.

27:30.431 --> 27:32.389
Thing was worth a boatload.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.478
No wonder he skipped town.
Didn't want to share

27:34.522 --> 27:38.004

with old Stanley.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.658
What about that night
that-that Oscar left?

27:39.701 --> 27:41.355
Do you remember that?Sure.

27:41.398 --> 27:45.533
He came back to the apartment
late, acting real cagey.

27:45.576 --> 27:49.537
Then, in the middle of the
night, he split without a word.

27:49.580 --> 27:52.322
Left behind all
his worldly possessions.

27:52.366 --> 27:56.326
It made no sense until I read
about the robbery in the papers.

27:56.370 --> 27:58.328
That's when I put
two and two together

27:58.372 --> 27:59.590
and realized what happened.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.683
Oscar killed that lady.

28:07.250 --> 28:10.079
You didn't think
to go to the police?

28:10.123 --> 28:13.648
I considered it,
but it would have been hard

28:13.692 --> 28:16.172
to explain how I got
that information.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.000
Always did feel
guilty, though,

28:18.044 --> 28:20.307
thinking about
that poor housekeeper,

28:20.350 --> 28:22.135
shot through the eye like that.

28:22.178 --> 28:23.745
Meanwhile,
Oscar's probably

28:23.789 --> 28:26.487
still living on what
he fetched for that snuffbox.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.098
Well, he's not exactly
living the high life.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.753
He, uh, moved
in with me.

28:31.797 --> 28:35.148
Wait. Oscar's
back in town?

28:35.191 --> 28:36.932
Yeah.
Well.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.456
The stones on that guy.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.675
[scoffs]

28:40.719 --> 28:43.939
So, you gonna arrest him?

28:43.983 --> 28:47.160
Well, after the story you just
told, we may have no choice.

28:47.203 --> 28:48.335
Especially if we find out

28:48.378 --> 28:50.119
he's still in possession
of that pistol.

28:50.163 --> 28:51.730
The smoking gun, huh?

28:51.773 --> 28:54.558
I'd be surprised
if he ever sold it.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.691
It-it could've linked him
to the murder, of course.

28:56.735 --> 29:00.477
Your uncle's a lot of things,
Gerard, but he's no dummy.

29:00.521 --> 29:04.612
I'm not really sure
who my uncle is anymore.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.266
TANI:
Thank you, Stanley.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.747
We have to get a search warrant
so we can search those boxes

29:08.790 --> 29:10.792
that Oscar had sent over
to Gerard's house.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.968
So this might
all be over soon?

29:13.012 --> 29:15.014
It could take a few hours
to get the warrant,

29:15.057 --> 29:17.016
but if we can find that gun,

29:17.059 --> 29:19.932
this cold case could be solved
by the end of the day.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.937
So, I guess
there's no denying it.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.677
My uncle's a murderer
after all.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.679
Did you hear what he said
about the housekeeper?

29:28.723 --> 29:30.812
That he shot her in cold blood?
Uh, yeah.
No.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.553
Specifically that she was shot
through the eye.

29:32.596 --> 29:35.991
That wasn't in the papers.
Only the police know that.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.776
Yeah, and one other person:
the murderer.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.691
You think Stanley killed her,
and not my uncle?

29:40.735 --> 29:42.171
I do.

29:42.215 --> 29:45.218
And if I'm right, I think I know
what he's gonna do next.

29:45.261 --> 29:47.176
Hey.JUNIOR:
So, we have an APB out

29:47.220 --> 29:48.569
on our missing robber
Christian Hopkins.

29:48.612 --> 29:49.875
No sign of him yet.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.833
And still no word back
on Cynthia's whereabouts.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.661
But we looked
into her travel history

29:53.704 --> 29:55.141
and found an
interesting pattern.

29:55.184 --> 29:57.621
She's been logging dozens
of trips a year,

29:57.665 --> 29:59.232
all with Greg.GROVER:
So, this isn't

29:59.275 --> 30:01.103
the first time they've done
this smuggling thing.

30:01.147 --> 30:03.453
ADAM:
The destinations vary.
Amsterdam, London, Chicago.

30:03.497 --> 30:07.718
But there's one city they
travel to regularly.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.242
Antwerp.

30:09.285 --> 30:10.504
It's a hub for the global
diamond trade.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.984
GROVER:
Well, that makes sense.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.855
Diamonds are highly portable,
they're easy to stash,

30:13.899 --> 30:16.162
and who the hell's gonna
think of a Midwestern couple

30:16.205 --> 30:17.990
as some kind of big
diamond smuggler?

30:18.033 --> 30:19.861
All right, let's reach out
to HPD, see if they can tell us

30:19.905 --> 30:21.602
anybody who fences diamonds
on the island.

30:21.645 --> 30:22.733
I'm sure there are
not many places

30:22.777 --> 30:24.561
that Hopkins can move
that much ice.

30:24.605 --> 30:25.649
STEVE:
Right. But we have
to assume

30:25.693 --> 30:26.999
that the guys who put
Hopkins' partner

30:27.042 --> 30:28.391
in a coma know
where he's headed.

30:28.435 --> 30:29.958
And if they find
him first,

30:30.002 --> 30:31.699
he's dead.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.100
[indistinct chatter]

30:51.284 --> 30:52.459
[door opens]

31:00.510 --> 31:03.122
OSCAR:
Weren't you gonna
say hello, Stan?

31:06.038 --> 31:07.822
What? Nothing to say?

31:07.866 --> 31:10.085
Okay. I'll do
the talking.

31:10.129 --> 31:12.914
'Cause I've had 42 long years
to think of what I wanted

31:12.958 --> 31:15.961
to say to you after
you forced me off the island.

31:16.004 --> 31:17.963
None of this would have happened
if you'd just done

31:18.006 --> 31:19.442
what you were supposed to do.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.444
It was one job, Stan.

31:21.488 --> 31:23.925
And you just couldn't let it go.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.797
No, I was supposed to just walk
away from that kind of payday

31:26.841 --> 31:29.452
because you got the hots
for the mark?

31:29.496 --> 31:32.281
I loved Tabitha.
And she loved me.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.109
She didn't love you.

31:34.153 --> 31:38.940
She loved Jay Gilbert,
a fiction, a myth.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.942
Tell you what, Stan.

31:42.161 --> 31:43.814
I'm gonna call the cops.

31:43.858 --> 31:44.990
I'm gonna tell 'em everything.

31:45.033 --> 31:46.643
They can put me away
for thieving, conning.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.819
[laughs]:
I don't care.

31:49.864 --> 31:52.519
As long as they
put you away, too.

31:52.562 --> 31:56.784
I'm afraid
I can't let you do that.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.614
TANI:
Drop it.
STANLEY:
What?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.444
Thanks for the confession,
by the way.

32:04.487 --> 32:05.836
It'll make it

32:05.880 --> 32:07.708
that much easier
to put you away for murder.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.234
STEVE:
Any luck with
those diamond fences?

32:12.278 --> 32:14.584
No, nothing yet, but
we got something else.

32:14.628 --> 32:16.499
So, a nurse
working Cynthia's floor

32:16.543 --> 32:17.848
at the hospital

32:17.892 --> 32:19.459
reported her
cell phone stolen.

32:19.502 --> 32:21.765
HPD tracked it and found it
in the trash can out front.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.550
We figured Cynthia must have
swiped it on her way out,

32:23.593 --> 32:24.812
so we pulled records

32:24.855 --> 32:26.640
and found an
outgoing call

32:26.683 --> 32:28.555
to this guy.JUNIOR: Fetu Kahele.

32:28.598 --> 32:31.297
A known player with
the local Samoan street gangs.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.689
It appears that
this is the guy

32:32.733 --> 32:34.691
that Cynthia and Greg were
smuggling the diamonds to.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.345
It makes sense, the Samoans
would want diamonds.

32:36.389 --> 32:38.130
It's a tax-free
mobile currency.

32:38.173 --> 32:39.958
All right, let's have HPD
round up anybody

32:40.001 --> 32:41.263
they find affiliated
with this gang.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.917
If these guys
are going after the diamonds,

32:42.961 --> 32:44.397
there's a good chance
Cynthia's with them.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.920
GROVER:
Hey, Eric Tenney's
out of his coma.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.313
Just in time to inform us

32:47.356 --> 32:49.489
that his partner
Christian Hopkins

32:49.532 --> 32:51.665
is gonna sell those diamonds
to one of their connections.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.841
The meeting's in ten minutes
in a parking structure

32:53.884 --> 32:55.712
in Chinatown,
and I have the address.

32:55.756 --> 32:57.366
Let's go.

33:00.282 --> 33:01.544
[vehicle approaching]

33:01.588 --> 33:03.503
Move, move, move!Yo, yo, get out of the way!

33:03.546 --> 33:06.506
[grunting]

33:07.855 --> 33:09.465
[tires screech]

33:17.082 --> 33:19.388
Look, I don't know
who you are,

33:19.432 --> 33:20.911
but you can take the diamonds
and the money.

33:20.955 --> 33:23.610
Good idea.No, please! Aah!

33:27.353 --> 33:28.397
Let's go.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.400
I said, let's go.

33:31.444 --> 33:34.664
You took something from me
that I can't get back.

33:36.536 --> 33:39.234
[siren blaring][tires screeching]

33:39.278 --> 33:40.931
FETU:
It's Five-O! Shoot 'em!

33:40.975 --> 33:43.456
[gunfire]

33:48.287 --> 33:50.028
Hands! Hands! Right now!

33:50.071 --> 33:52.247
Weapons down!
Put it down!

33:52.291 --> 33:54.945
Get on your knees!That's it, fellas.
Nice and slow.

33:54.989 --> 33:56.164
STEVE:
Hands on your head, interlock
your fingers right now.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.383
Now! Move!

33:57.426 --> 33:58.949
Boss?

33:58.993 --> 34:00.864
Copy.

34:00.908 --> 34:03.041
Cynthia?

34:03.084 --> 34:05.086
Cynthia?

34:05.130 --> 34:06.827
Look at me. Cynthia.

34:06.870 --> 34:08.524
Be smart, Cynthia.

34:08.568 --> 34:09.830
Got to drop that weapon,

34:09.873 --> 34:11.571
or we got to put you
down. You know that.

34:11.614 --> 34:12.485
[cocks gun]

34:13.312 --> 34:14.922
Cynthia.

34:17.577 --> 34:18.665
I'm putting

34:18.708 --> 34:20.884
my weapon down.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.714
Don't look at
him. Look at me.

34:24.758 --> 34:26.064
Okay?

34:27.108 --> 34:28.414
I know that you just lost

34:28.457 --> 34:30.546
the most important person
in your life, okay?

34:31.591 --> 34:34.159
I understand the
weight of that pain.

34:34.202 --> 34:35.508
I do.

34:35.551 --> 34:37.597
Cynthia, look at me.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.816
If you kill this man,

34:39.860 --> 34:42.123
it's not gonna take
that pain away.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.475
Please put the weapon down.

34:46.519 --> 34:49.043
Please.

34:53.352 --> 34:54.614
[crying]

35:01.751 --> 35:03.536
[gun clatters]

35:03.579 --> 35:05.277
It's okay.

35:08.715 --> 35:11.021
Just turn around
for me, okay?

35:11.065 --> 35:12.675
I got you.

35:12.719 --> 35:15.287
Everything's
gonna be okay.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.332
I got you. Come on.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.208
Watch your head.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.957
You know, it's funny. If
things went differently,

35:34.001 --> 35:36.177
we might still be
running cons today.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.484
But there was a wrinkle.

35:38.527 --> 35:40.877
I fell in love.HIRSCH:
You could've

35:40.921 --> 35:43.184
gone to the police,
tell them what really happened.

35:43.228 --> 35:46.318
Honestly, the thought
of implicating myself

35:46.361 --> 35:49.190
or doing time for my part in it,
that didn't scare me.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.887
No, it was the...

35:50.931 --> 35:53.281
It was the thought of
looking Tabitha in the eye

35:53.325 --> 35:54.587
and admitting what I had done.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.719
So I held on to
that damn snuffbox

35:56.763 --> 35:58.112
for all of these years,

35:58.156 --> 36:01.159
hoping that I would
have the chance...

36:02.812 --> 36:05.772
...and the courage to return it.

36:09.776 --> 36:11.604
Yeah.

36:14.607 --> 36:17.784
I-I-I know I caused you
a lot of pain.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.133
Truth is,

36:19.177 --> 36:21.831
you saved my life.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.355
After what happened,

36:23.398 --> 36:26.227
I went straight.
I never robbed anybody again.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.447
I also...

36:28.490 --> 36:31.058
never loved
another woman again.

36:32.886 --> 36:35.149
Not like I loved you.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.458
I know I don't deserve
your forgiveness,

36:39.501 --> 36:43.244
but if you'd be willing
to give me a chance,

36:43.288 --> 36:46.334
I'd-I'd like to try
to gain it back.

36:50.077 --> 36:53.211
As nice as, uh,
half a million dollars would be,

36:53.254 --> 36:56.562
helping Uncle Oscar get a shot
at a second chance, it's...

36:56.605 --> 36:58.564
it's priceless, isn't it?

36:58.607 --> 37:00.783
Have to agree
with you on that.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.786
And who knows? If things
go well enough with Tabitha,

37:03.830 --> 37:05.875
maybe he won't have
to move in with me.

37:05.919 --> 37:07.312
What?

37:07.355 --> 37:09.270
You guys are always
telling me to be honest.Yeah.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.403
You're right. Honesty's
good. It's good.

37:11.446 --> 37:14.275
Feel like honesty could
have saved those two

37:14.319 --> 37:15.755
a lot of heartbreak.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.932
Hey, you know,
getting past those hurdles

37:18.975 --> 37:22.370
is what helps you
get through the, uh...

37:22.414 --> 37:24.720
the relay?

37:24.764 --> 37:26.113
No. What...

37:26.156 --> 37:27.462
What race has hurdles?

37:27.506 --> 37:28.768
It's called the hurdles.

37:28.811 --> 37:31.901
Ah. Aptly named.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.826
[doorbell rings]

37:46.873 --> 37:48.178
What's going on?

37:48.222 --> 37:49.963
Since when did you start
locking the front door?

37:50.006 --> 37:51.747
Uh, since McGarrett
came home to find this guy

37:51.791 --> 37:53.183
on our couch,
drinking our coffee,

37:53.227 --> 37:55.142
making out with our dog.HIRSCH:
Hey.

37:55.185 --> 37:57.100
Eddie definitely made
the first move.

37:57.144 --> 37:58.232
[whines]

37:59.059 --> 38:00.974
Hmm. Well, I got
some good news,

38:01.017 --> 38:03.150
Joon. We weren't the only
ones who closed a case today.

38:04.238 --> 38:05.457
These two, apparently,

38:05.500 --> 38:07.850
have just solved a
40-plus-year-old murder

38:07.894 --> 38:10.505
andbusted an armed senior
citizen. How about that?

38:10.549 --> 38:11.593
JUNIOR:
Congrats. Congrats.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.116
McGarrett's
gonna be out soon.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.075
Anyone up for a beer?Oh, not for me.
But I would like

38:15.118 --> 38:17.077
a glass of that
Central Coast chardonnay

38:17.120 --> 38:19.209
that I saw languishing
in the fridge this morning.

38:19.253 --> 38:21.690
All right. Chardonnay
for the man.Oh, no.

38:21.734 --> 38:24.606
I-I can get it. I-I know
where you keep the stemware.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.305
Cap?

38:27.348 --> 38:29.132
No, I'm good, I'm...

38:34.399 --> 38:36.401
Yeah, um,
I think I'll have some wine.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.885
Can we go somewhere to talk?

38:45.279 --> 38:48.064
My reaction this morning.

38:48.108 --> 38:50.589
It was...Not about breakfast?

38:50.632 --> 38:53.243
It was not, no.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.334
I know I-I don't talk
about this a lot,

38:56.377 --> 38:59.380
but, you know, my-my mom left us
when, when I was really young,

38:59.424 --> 39:01.295
and, uh, I think it...

39:01.339 --> 39:05.430
I think it really screwed me up
back then, and...

39:05.473 --> 39:07.432
it still does.

39:07.475 --> 39:10.391
Any time someone's good to me,

39:10.435 --> 39:12.915
any time I start
to like someone, like...

39:12.959 --> 39:14.917
like, really like them,

39:14.961 --> 39:17.442
I g-get this fear

39:17.485 --> 39:20.401
that I'm gonna lose them

39:20.445 --> 39:22.229
because I don't deserve them.

39:22.272 --> 39:24.666
And so I self-sabotage,

39:24.710 --> 39:26.102
because if someone's
gonna leave you,

39:26.146 --> 39:30.324
then it's better to be
the one that ends it, right?

39:30.368 --> 39:32.761
And that's why my problem

39:32.805 --> 39:34.023
is you.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.113
Because you're so good
and you're so kind

39:37.157 --> 39:39.464
and you're so lovely to me

39:39.507 --> 39:43.119
that every...

39:43.163 --> 39:47.472
frightened and insecure bone
in my body just...

39:47.515 --> 39:50.823
just wants to blow it up
before you do.

39:56.002 --> 39:58.265
Look at me. Hey. Look at me.

40:00.223 --> 40:02.312
I'm not going anywhere.

40:02.356 --> 40:04.576
♪

40:12.235 --> 40:14.368
I could totally
start being meaner

40:14.412 --> 40:16.109
if that's what you want.

40:16.152 --> 40:18.459
You couldn't if you tried.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.771
Mmm.

40:25.814 --> 40:27.555
It's quite puckery

40:27.599 --> 40:31.820
with a sexy nose of,
uh, oak and molasses.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.170
Yeah.
[sniffs]

40:34.214 --> 40:35.476
Yeah, it's funny.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.913
I-I'm only getting
a whole lot of BS.

40:37.957 --> 40:39.654
The problem is, you're
not tasting it right.

40:39.698 --> 40:41.526
You have to take
in the aroma,

40:41.569 --> 40:43.571
then tilt your head back,

40:43.615 --> 40:45.443
swirl it around
in your mouth

40:45.486 --> 40:47.488
to excite the taste buds.

40:53.276 --> 40:54.887
Am I interrupting
something?

40:54.930 --> 40:56.584
Good. Beer.

40:56.628 --> 40:57.672
Thank you.Yeah, yeah.

40:57.716 --> 41:00.066
Yeah, yeah.
You got it, buddy.

41:00.109 --> 41:02.111
There you go.
[exhales]

41:02.155 --> 41:05.158
So, I just got off the phone
with Interpol.

41:05.201 --> 41:06.855
Cynthia is cooperating.

41:06.899 --> 41:09.118
Mmm!They seem optimistic
that with her help,

41:09.162 --> 41:11.947
they'll be able to shut down
the diamond smuggling operation.

41:11.991 --> 41:13.296
Well, I'll drink to that.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.994
With a beer.[laughs]

41:17.649 --> 41:19.520
Hey, where is everyone?

41:19.564 --> 41:22.305
Yeah, that's a good question.

41:22.349 --> 41:23.872
JOHN:
When he was five years old,

41:23.916 --> 41:28.050
I asked my son Steve what
he wanted to be when he grew up.

41:28.094 --> 41:31.445
"I want to be a cop,
Dad, like you."

41:33.012 --> 41:34.970
I told him to...

41:35.014 --> 41:38.017
be anything but that.

41:40.541 --> 41:43.152
The life of a cop is...

41:43.196 --> 41:46.504
is not easy.

41:46.547 --> 41:49.507
It's not that I'm not proud
of the work that I did,

41:49.550 --> 41:53.162
but more than anything,
I have, uh...

41:53.206 --> 41:54.642
I have regrets.

41:54.686 --> 41:56.688
[phone ringing]

42:02.694 --> 42:03.912
It's McGarrett.

42:03.956 --> 42:06.828
Mr. McGarrett.
My name is Michael Claypool.

42:06.872 --> 42:08.526
I'm a barrister here in London,

42:08.569 --> 42:11.180
and at my client's instruction,
I've been tasked

42:11.224 --> 42:13.095
with hand-delivering
a package to you.

42:13.139 --> 42:14.401
If it works for you,

42:14.444 --> 42:17.273
I can be in Honolulu
in two days' time.

42:17.317 --> 42:19.493
I'm-I'm sorry,
who's your client?

42:19.537 --> 42:21.843
Doris McGarrett.

42:25.978 --> 42:27.719
There must be some mistake.

42:27.762 --> 42:29.851
My mother,
she died, uh, months ago now.

42:29.895 --> 42:32.680
Her estate's all been settled,
so, uh...

42:32.724 --> 42:34.508
This is a separate matter.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.989
And your mother's instructions
were very clear.

42:37.032 --> 42:38.251
Upon her death,

42:38.294 --> 42:40.166
I was to wait a period
of four months

42:40.209 --> 42:41.689
before contacting you.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.909
This package, what is it?

42:43.952 --> 42:46.302
I'm sorry. I don't know.

42:46.346 --> 42:49.741
I'm just following
the instructions I was given.
