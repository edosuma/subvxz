Move.

01:03.793 --> 01:05.854
Nice and steady.
Archie, you know what to do.

01:05.954 --> 01:07.954
-Yup
-Quick as you can.

01:08.595 --> 01:11.376
Come on, Tillie.
Sage, that's it. You're safe.

Tillie, here you go. Tillie.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.861
-[Dom] Just go, just go, just go.
-[Archie] Mum!

01:24.961 --> 01:26.822
-[Dom] Keep close behind me. That's it.

01:26.922 --> 01:28.503
Keep the pace up, guys. Keep the pace up.

01:28.603 --> 01:30.744
Move ahead.
Come on move ahead.

01:38.487 --> 01:40.488
Here you go, darling. Off you go.

01:42.569 --> 01:44.569
Good girl.

01:50.812 --> 01:52.313
Two minutes, 20.

01:52.413 --> 01:55.374
Sloppy work, people. Sloppy work.

-[Eadie] It's National Service.

I don't remember them saying

"Turn up when you feel like it"
on the form.

03:23.890 --> 03:28.472
I just don't understand why you don't get
Dom to sort you out an exemption.

03:28.572 --> 03:32.914
[Eadie] I don't understand why I have
so many shoes. I mean, it's absurd.

03:33.014 --> 03:35.355
Is there some sort of weird thing
going on between you and him?

03:35.455 --> 03:37.276
You don't want him to do you a favour
or something?

03:37.376 --> 03:39.076
It's like I've got some sort of
octopus delusion or something.

03:39.176 --> 03:41.557
I mean, how many feet
do I really think I have?

03:41.657 --> 03:44.539
And are you sure
you can't start tomorrow?

03:45.539 --> 03:49.161
I don't want an exemption, alright.
I don't want to be exempt.

03:49.261 --> 03:52.682
I just want to do something that's
not about me for one second, and you're...

03:52.782 --> 03:55.023
I don't know why you're so hung up
about it. Why do you even care?

03:57.984 --> 04:00.445

Have you got product in your hair?

04:00.545 --> 04:02.926
No. Ye... Maybe.

04:15.351 --> 04:16.732
It's not a big deal. It's...

04:16.832 --> 04:18.212
Of course it's a big deal.

04:18.312 --> 04:19.813
It's the biggest presentation
of your career.

04:19.913 --> 04:21.494
-Don't worry about it. It's fine.
-I'm gonna call them.

It's okay.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.167
You go do your thing.

If you don't show up
when we win the Nobel Prize,

04:57.128 --> 04:59.369
then we've got a real problem, OK?

05:05.972 --> 05:07.553
[quietly] I love you, baby.

to return to your homes,

06:51.535 --> 06:54.116
please make your way
back to the pavilion.

Now, if you're here applying
for an Urban Residency Permit,

06:57.658 --> 06:59.479
you need to go through

06:59.579 --> 07:02.280

Correct? You're the new
National Service person?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.408
-Yeah.
-Awesome.

07:21.508 --> 07:25.089
Eadie. Abel Keralo.
Get gloved up, masked up.

07:25.189 --> 07:27.190
We don't get on top of this intake,
the whole day is shot.

07:28.871 --> 07:31.292
Everyone gets a blood test for hepatitis,

HIV, malaria, Ross River,
yellow fever, typhoid.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.614
Swabs in there for influenza.

07:36.714 --> 07:39.255
Blood smear for chagas. Skin test for TB.

07:39.355 --> 07:41.456
And they spit in a cup on the way out.

07:41.556 --> 07:43.217
What's the spit for?

07:43.317 --> 07:44.697
DNA repository.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.298
Wow.
They have a choice?

07:46.398 --> 07:48.939
Or - you want help,
you hand over the data?

07:49.039 --> 07:51.220
I'm sorry, you are a doctor, right?

07:51.320 --> 07:54.021
'Cause they told me
I was getting a doctor.

[speaker feedback]

08:15.410 --> 08:17.411
Hi. Attention, everyone.

08:18.011 --> 08:21.052
You all need to get
your wristbands scanned.

08:22.373 --> 08:24.834
If you were given
a positive medical score,

08:24.934 --> 08:28.995
you'll be shown how to access food
and clothing and shown where to sleep.

08:29.095 --> 08:31.796
Now, if you have a negative medical score,

08:31.896 --> 08:33.477
you'll be led through the side doors,

08:33.577 --> 08:38.159
where Border Control Officers
will direct you onto the buses.

08:38.259 --> 08:40.260
Thank you.

08:43.501 --> 08:45.582
[crowd chatter,
muffled announcements]

08:47.583 --> 08:50.844
So what happens to the people
who end up back on the bus?

08:50.944 --> 08:52.645
They go back to their residency zone,

08:52.745 --> 08:55.406
treated in hospitals
close to their registered address.

08:55.506 --> 08:57.247
Back to the rural hospitals?

08:57.347 --> 09:00.528
That don't have the expertise to treat
what they've got in the first place.

09:00.628 --> 09:04.210
The centre's remit is to help
those who qualify for it.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.770

09:05.870 --> 09:07.971
Welcome to the remit.

09:34.042 --> 09:36.063
Concierge. I buzz you through
to see your brother.

09:36.163 --> 09:37.864
Yeah, sorry, I didn't...

09:37.964 --> 09:39.784
Recognise me without the suit.

09:39.884 --> 09:41.425
Yeah. [laughs]

09:41.525 --> 09:44.346
Do you do the security here as well?

09:44.446 --> 09:48.368
No, no. Um... my family are here.

09:50.369 --> 09:51.989
They still had to do their regional year

09:52.089 --> 09:53.910
before they could apply to
come into the city.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.671
Do you work here?

09:55.771 --> 10:00.673
No, I'm a volunteer. National Service.
Just helping out in the medical tents.

10:00.773 --> 10:02.774
Oh, well, you drew the short straw.

10:05.495 --> 10:07.496
Cool. I won't hold you.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.661
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:24.823 --> 10:26.824
Give us your phone.

10:27.624 --> 10:29.485
I've gotta show you
how this data loop works.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.586
So...

10:32.466 --> 10:35.787
This is a loop of last week's data
when you, ah...

10:36.868 --> 10:38.869
...lost the baby.

10:39.589 --> 10:44.831
This will keep coming to you and Lloyd
in a loop until you take the implant off.

10:49.193 --> 10:53.555
And this is what's actually going on
inside there.

10:59.797 --> 11:01.458
Thank you.

11:01.558 --> 11:04.679
Eadie, are you sure
you shouldn't just tell him now?

11:07.040 --> 11:08.501
Tell him.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.602
Ask forgiveness.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.843
I think I've missed that boat.

11:14.403 --> 11:17.985
Right now, until I know
if this one's sticking around,

11:18.085 --> 11:21.406
the only reason to tell him
is so I'd feel better.

11:24.527 --> 11:26.528
OK.

11:29.449 --> 11:31.450
Good luck for today.

Yes, you mentioned, Herman.
Twelve times.

12:08.305 --> 12:10.526
You deviate and include
any more of the data,

-Me, darling, not you.

14:25.522 --> 14:27.502
-You never fake it.
-Don't touch me. OK.

14:27.602 --> 14:29.963
-[technician] Hey. Mics are on now.

14:35.486 --> 14:39.867
In searching for a high efficiency gene
disruption in Trypanosoma Cruzi,

14:39.967 --> 14:42.669
the etiologic agent of chagas disease,

14:42.769 --> 14:44.870
we had a singular hypothesis.

14:44.970 --> 14:48.991
This shows the C-terminal tagging
of the endogenous proteins...

14:49.091 --> 14:52.653
We used the...
[voice fades]

14:58.215 --> 14:59.796
...Cas9/pTREX vector

14:59.896 --> 15:01.957
to insert--

15:02.057 --> 15:04.678
[Shay] --SGRJ targeted the GO1 is

15:04.778 --> 15:07.479
PCR amplified and cloned.

15:07.579 --> 15:12.241
The donor sequence contains
both the tag sequence and the marker

15:12.341 --> 15:14.342
for antibiotic resistance...

15:14.822 --> 15:17.883
...in addition to more than 100bp
homology arms corresponding

15:17.983 --> 15:20.484
to regions located upstream

15:20.584 --> 15:24.406
of the stop codon
and downstream of the Cas9 target site.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.607
-[Lloyd] ..aiming to induce
a double strand break in a site

15:27.707 --> 15:30.448
that could be replicated multiple times
down the germ line.

15:30.548 --> 15:34.090
And verify that it doesn't generate
off target effects

15:34.190 --> 15:36.191
on the T.cruzi genome...

15:36.951 --> 15:41.753
And so we come to the final results
and to the sigma.

15:49.356 --> 15:50.737
What's the "sigma"?

15:50.837 --> 15:54.578
Oh, it's the number that lets us know
if your dad's results were a fluke or not.

15:54.678 --> 15:56.579
So, zero - obvious fail.

15:56.679 --> 15:58.860
Two's good. Three's excellent.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.321
All the way up to four, out of the park.

16:07.924 --> 16:09.924
It's yours.

16:10.605 --> 16:12.605
Take it.

16:21.409 --> 16:24.470
[energetic strings begin to fade in]

16:24.570 --> 16:26.691
Detached flagella indicated by
the white arrows.

16:28.652 --> 16:31.053
Single cell details shown in Panel 'B'.

16:32.894 --> 16:36.715
Second generation blood count...
numbers are in green.

16:36.815 --> 16:41.177
And when we run these numbers through
our standard deviation modelling...

16:51.581 --> 16:56.123
...it delivers a sigma of... five.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.545
[applause]

17:05.187 --> 17:08.428
[tense atmospheric music]

17:23.995 --> 17:25.775
[cheering]

17:25.875 --> 17:28.837
[applause continues]

17:37.040 --> 17:41.042
[cameras click]

17:52.967 --> 17:55.588
If there was ever a reason
to take a day off...

17:55.688 --> 17:59.029
I know, I would love to,
but I have a tonne of work to do.

17:59.129 --> 18:02.370
And I'd rather take the day off with you
when we can just hang out together, OK.

18:03.371 --> 18:05.512
Come on, I'll take you.
You'll be back in time for maths.

18:05.612 --> 18:07.072
Hey, thank you.

18:07.172 --> 18:08.553
Thank you for bringing her down.

18:08.653 --> 18:10.654
Couldn't be happier for you.

18:16.216 --> 18:17.917
Interview requests

18:18.017 --> 18:19.678
from SCN, ASR,

18:19.778 --> 18:22.799
Stream 365 News and CBN.

18:22.899 --> 18:24.840
Three companies are offering us
equipment.

18:24.940 --> 18:28.841
And an offer to fly us to the
Capstone Festival in Prague next week.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.342
[chuckles] OK.

18:32.343 --> 18:34.344
Here we go.

18:34.904 --> 18:37.445
Remarkable. Who'd have thought it?

18:37.545 --> 18:38.765
Certainly not you, Herm.

18:38.865 --> 18:41.226
Judgements I retract in full.

18:42.387 --> 18:46.989
I mean, I could go on about it
but I'd rather make good in kind.

18:47.989 --> 18:49.450
What's that?

18:49.550 --> 18:51.551
Preliminary research budget.

18:52.391 --> 18:55.812
But get ready for some serious courting.

18:55.912 --> 18:58.113
There are a dozen
expressions of interest already.

18:59.114 --> 19:01.115
How many years is this over?

19:01.995 --> 19:03.776
Oh, ah, just the one.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.597
Better make a plan for spending it
before the board changes their mind.

19:07.757 --> 19:09.758
[Shay chuckles]

19:11.239 --> 19:13.240
Today's been a good day, eh?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.441
Yeah, it has indeed.

19:18.602 --> 19:20.603
No Eadie?

19:21.083 --> 19:23.964
No, no, she's made
the National Service commitment.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.365
She wanted to bail but I insisted.

19:34.808 --> 19:36.549
Zahra Malak, CBM News.

19:36.649 --> 19:38.030
I'm wondering if you can talk about

19:38.130 --> 19:40.711
what brought you both to science
in the first place?

19:40.811 --> 19:42.632
And what do you say to those claiming

19:42.732 --> 19:46.653
you're stomping all over Mother Nature,
playing God in the lab?

19:47.734 --> 19:49.734
Uh...

19:50.975 --> 19:52.035
[chuckles]

19:52.135 --> 19:55.377
Well, that's a pretty reductionist way
of thinking about things.

19:57.218 --> 20:03.580
But I got into biology because I wanted
to understand the laws of nature, not...

20:07.062 --> 20:10.043
Uh, you know, we don't have
too many kissing bugs

20:10.143 --> 20:13.004
because there's
a fault with those natural laws.

20:13.104 --> 20:14.485
We have too many kissing bugs

20:14.585 --> 20:17.246
because we have made such
an horrendous mess of things, OK.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.347
So, far from... from...

20:20.227 --> 20:21.688
I don't know, trying to dominate
Mother Nature,

20:21.788 --> 20:24.309
I am in Mother Nature's service.

20:25.389 --> 20:26.850
-[Shay mumbles] That's cute.

20:26.950 --> 20:28.410
-And you, Mr. Levine?

20:28.510 --> 20:30.691
I am just in it for the money.

20:30.791 --> 20:32.792
[laughter]

20:34.713 --> 20:37.494
I might let Shay finish this off.

20:37.594 --> 20:39.675
He's got more than enough to say
for both of us.

20:40.835 --> 20:43.176
Uh... Herm...

20:43.276 --> 20:45.277
why don't you...

20:46.438 --> 20:48.439
Yeah.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.419
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

20:50.519 --> 20:52.860
It's been a great day for NIS.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.941
And I'd just like to say
we're extremely proud of our...

20:55.041 --> 20:57.542
Would it actually kill you to admit
that what we did was a big deal?

20:57.642 --> 20:59.103
It actually means something.

20:59.203 --> 21:01.904
I'm happy to. But I'm not gonna do it
like some performing seal.

21:02.004 --> 21:03.825
We don't owe those people anything.

21:03.925 --> 21:05.866
Let alone a peek into our souls,

21:05.966 --> 21:07.827
that they're gonna turn into
some cheap bullshit sound bite

21:07.927 --> 21:10.428
for morons to chew up and spit out
three minutes later.

21:10.528 --> 21:15.450
You're gonna... You're gonna have to
help me out a bit here.

21:18.051 --> 21:20.332
Things aren't great on the home front.
It's just this...

21:23.053 --> 21:25.134
It's just this whole baby thing, you know.

21:29.615 --> 21:32.317
We have to stay connected to
this monitoring app for the next month

21:32.417 --> 21:34.417
and every day it's just like...

21:34.898 --> 21:36.678
It's like watching her
getting stabbed in the face.

21:36.778 --> 21:39.379
"You are not pregnant.
You are not pregnant. You're not..."

21:40.380 --> 21:42.381
Like she could forget.

21:46.662 --> 21:48.663
And you know what the worst thing is...

21:52.425 --> 21:55.366
...it's like, for two years,
I have had my hand in the fire

21:55.466 --> 21:57.607
and now I'm finally able to take it out.

21:57.707 --> 21:59.688
And I just want to
punch myself in the face,

21:59.788 --> 22:04.870
'cause all I feel is just relief
that this horror show is over.

22:08.271 --> 22:10.272
But every day since we've given up...

22:12.393 --> 22:13.894
...she gets further away from me.

22:13.994 --> 22:16.635
It's like when she sees me,
she looks at me, she sees her pain.

22:26.799 --> 22:28.800
[scoffs]

22:29.440 --> 22:31.381
Thank you.

22:31.481 --> 22:32.701
For what?

22:32.801 --> 22:34.802
[scoffs] For not...

22:35.563 --> 22:37.723
...you know, for not saying anything.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.725
Thanks.

22:41.205 --> 22:43.206
Anytime.

22:47.487 --> 22:50.028
[clattering]

22:50.128 --> 22:52.129
-[woman] I need to get out of here!

22:54.010 --> 22:56.071
-[Eadie] Hey, hey, hey.

22:56.171 --> 22:59.152
She's got no ID.
She won't even tell me her name.

22:59.252 --> 23:02.354
-Won't or can't?
-[woman whimpers]

23:02.454 --> 23:05.175
I know I don't always want to do
what I'm told, but...

23:06.495 --> 23:08.876
Hey. My name's Eadie.

23:08.976 --> 23:10.977
Can you tell me your name?

23:13.818 --> 23:15.819
No? OK.

23:16.539 --> 23:18.540
Do you know it?

23:20.501 --> 23:21.962
No.

23:22.062 --> 23:24.062
[Eadie] OK. That's OK.

23:26.744 --> 23:29.425
It's so hot in here.

23:30.425 --> 23:32.806
Do you want to, um,
come and get some fresh air

23:32.906 --> 23:34.907
and we can make a bit of a plan?

23:36.307 --> 23:38.668
Yeah? Just go for a little walk.

23:42.150 --> 23:45.211
So, if we work backwards,

23:45.311 --> 23:48.733
you remember getting off the bus here,
yeah?

23:48.833 --> 23:50.333
Yeah?

23:50.433 --> 23:53.675
How about getting on the bus?

23:56.716 --> 23:58.777
This last one came from the Central West,

23:58.877 --> 24:01.538
so you would have got on at, um...

24:01.638 --> 24:03.639
Dubbo?

24:04.479 --> 24:06.480
Millthorpe?

24:07.040 --> 24:08.661
Oberon?

24:08.761 --> 24:09.941
Um...

24:10.041 --> 24:12.042
Yeah?

24:12.922 --> 24:15.564
Yeah. So maybe...
Maybe you live in Oberon?

24:17.004 --> 24:19.525
Maybe you were caught up in
the storm there last night?

24:23.527 --> 24:25.528
Do you know what day it is?

24:27.648 --> 24:29.949
Tuesday?

24:30.049 --> 24:32.050
You're doing good.

24:34.291 --> 24:36.872
Can you tell me something
that's happening in the news?

24:36.972 --> 24:38.973
Something current?

24:40.214 --> 24:42.214
Weather's turned to shit.

24:46.336 --> 24:47.797
-Nausea?
-Mm.

24:47.897 --> 24:49.357
Headache?

24:49.457 --> 24:51.458
OK.

24:52.219 --> 24:54.039
Can you hold your hands up?

24:54.139 --> 24:55.720
Grab my hands.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.561
Make fists, really tight.

24:57.661 --> 24:59.121
Great.

24:59.221 --> 25:01.983
Don't let me pull your arms down, OK.

25:03.263 --> 25:05.264
Good.

25:06.424 --> 25:10.566
Well, I think it's safe to say
you don't work in a nail salon.

25:10.666 --> 25:14.388
Honest hands. That's what my um...

25:16.949 --> 25:18.950
My...

25:20.390 --> 25:22.391
Are you married?

25:24.152 --> 25:26.152
Maybe.

25:31.355 --> 25:33.616
So, there's no external injuries,

25:33.716 --> 25:37.377
then the first thing we consider
is a traumatic brain injury.

25:37.477 --> 25:39.738
A knock to the head
and things haven't resettled properly.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.139
-[Abel] Has rice arrived yet?

25:41.239 --> 25:43.420
Oh, as I speak. You're too good, people.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.220
To be sure, she needs an MEG scan

25:45.320 --> 25:48.602
and without any ID credentials,
that's gonna be a hard one to pull off.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.463
We're a little low on brain tech.

25:51.563 --> 25:53.144
And unless it's an emergency,

25:53.244 --> 25:55.545
you won't be able to
get her into your hospital, correct?

25:55.645 --> 25:57.645
Any ideas?

26:09.290 --> 26:10.911
I'll bring it back. I promise.

26:11.011 --> 26:12.712
I heard you were never here.

26:12.812 --> 26:14.552
Maybe that's why
you're not answering my calls.

26:14.652 --> 26:16.553
You've disappeared
off the face of the earth.

26:16.653 --> 26:18.114
Sorry.

26:18.214 --> 26:19.755
Have you been doing the injections yourself?

26:19.855 --> 26:21.875
No, I uh...

26:21.975 --> 26:27.258
You tell me you've gotten a new support
person, I'm gonna feel very cheated.

26:29.218 --> 26:31.219
You're off the hook.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.062
I'm so sorry, babe.

26:38.902 --> 26:40.603
When?

26:40.703 --> 26:42.944
A couple of days ago.

26:44.785 --> 26:46.085
You didn't call me.

26:46.185 --> 26:48.186
No, I just um...

26:49.587 --> 26:51.327
I just needed to do this one on my own.

26:51.427 --> 26:54.049
Of course. Sorry.
That was so needy of me.

26:54.149 --> 26:58.210
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm... around if you need me.

26:58.310 --> 27:00.311
And I'm not around if you don't.

27:09.115 --> 27:15.197
[helicopter whirring]

27:21.800 --> 27:23.741
Where's that going? Um...

27:23.841 --> 27:25.582
Hey, boss, can I just get
your signature real quick?

27:25.682 --> 27:28.023
-OK.
-Thank you.

27:28.123 --> 27:31.124
Well, it's not his decision if he goes
to school or not, Chesca. It's ours.

27:32.124 --> 27:35.305
Yeah, and every time you let him
get away with it... No, I'm just saying...

27:35.405 --> 27:37.787
I'm just saying
that if there's a real problem

27:37.887 --> 27:39.347
and we need to get away in a hurry,

27:39.447 --> 27:41.448
it doesn't matter if he likes the way
it feels or not.

27:42.248 --> 27:43.709
[door shuts]

27:43.809 --> 27:45.270
Yeah, I know.

27:45.370 --> 27:47.370
I'm sorry.

27:47.851 --> 27:49.851
OK.

27:50.812 --> 27:52.393
I'll see if I can swing by this afternoon.

27:52.493 --> 27:53.793
Bye.

27:53.893 --> 27:55.354
-Cosmo?

27:55.454 --> 27:57.595
Yeah, I'm running drills with them
at the moment.

27:57.695 --> 28:00.776
Unless he gets 24 hours notice and
some sheepskin earmuffs, he can't cope.

28:01.776 --> 28:03.557
So, give them to him?

28:03.657 --> 28:05.518
You know when the shit hits the fan,

28:05.618 --> 28:07.479
you're just gonna pick him up
and get the hell outta there.

28:07.579 --> 28:09.680
So why put all of you through it?

28:09.780 --> 28:11.961
At the end of the day,
remind me to fire you.

28:12.061 --> 28:15.142
I'm taking the kids away for the weekend.
You can get the early train.

28:16.142 --> 28:18.043
Denillo's have booked a pick-up.

28:18.143 --> 28:19.484
Quick taxi run to the airport.

28:19.584 --> 28:21.044
Better fire up the limo.

28:21.144 --> 28:22.925
[pilot] What, are you coming?

28:23.025 --> 28:24.966
Yeah, they've just upgraded to
premium customers,

28:25.066 --> 28:27.067
so Harlow wants to make sure
they get looked after by a partner.

28:29.828 --> 28:31.449
-[Eadie] So let me talk you through
what I'm seeing.

28:31.549 --> 28:33.809
I'm seeing swelling here,

28:33.909 --> 28:37.371
which is one of the markers we'd
expect from a traumatic brain injury.

28:37.471 --> 28:40.372
What I'm also seeing are

28:40.472 --> 28:45.514
some pretty significant changes
to your dopamine receptors.

28:47.995 --> 28:49.456
What does that mean?

28:49.556 --> 28:54.218
It means you've been cooking yourself
a pretty intense pharmaceutical habit

28:54.318 --> 28:55.698
for the last couple of years.

28:55.798 --> 29:02.301
Probably one of the peptide-based
analgesics like Oliceridine or Fentanyl.

29:02.401 --> 29:08.304
Here and here, that's structural
change to the neural pathways.

29:08.404 --> 29:13.326
And all of this red activity here,
that's acute opioid withdrawal.

29:14.646 --> 29:16.647
That's the good news.

29:17.888 --> 29:21.909
Because it accounts for
part of why you feel so bad.

29:22.009 --> 29:25.071
You're up to your eyeballs in cold turkey.

29:25.171 --> 29:27.111
In time that will subside.

29:27.211 --> 29:29.712
Is that why I can't remember anything?

29:29.812 --> 29:31.793
I just fried my brain?

29:31.893 --> 29:33.354
I don't think so.

29:33.454 --> 29:36.435
But it's so noisy in there right now,

29:36.535 --> 29:39.396
it's like trying to hear a pin drop
in the middle of the freeway.

29:39.496 --> 29:41.917
We just need to ride out the withdrawal

29:42.017 --> 29:45.579
until we can get a better picture
of what's actually happening.

29:47.059 --> 29:48.760
A junkie, eh?

29:48.860 --> 29:50.941
What a first thing to know.

29:51.661 --> 29:53.662
[Abel] Our support team
will take it from here.

30:04.587 --> 30:08.888
If she was getting her fix over the
counter, we'll be able to track a file.

30:08.988 --> 30:11.570
It's a Schedule 8 drug and you can't
get it without a thumb print anymore.

30:11.670 --> 30:13.670
I think we'll keep you after all.

30:14.551 --> 30:16.552
Well, don't put yourself out.

30:17.952 --> 30:19.953
[helicopter whirrs]

30:21.354 --> 30:23.014
[pilot] Wondered how you'd feel about
me taking Mo out

30:23.114 --> 30:24.655
for a flight next weekend?

30:24.755 --> 30:25.815
It's his birthday.

30:25.915 --> 30:27.696
Wow, he's gonna love that.

30:27.796 --> 30:29.617
You'll be dad of the year.

30:29.717 --> 30:31.878
Let's get these guys out
and take an early mark.

30:43.443 --> 30:45.343
[helicopter powering down]

30:45.443 --> 30:47.584
Lou, how are you?

30:47.684 --> 30:50.265
Good. Good to see you.
We're not quite ready, though.

30:50.365 --> 30:52.706
Miles isn't feeling so good.

30:52.806 --> 30:54.347
-[woman] Nice and slow.

30:54.447 --> 30:56.708
That's it. Just nice and slow.

30:56.808 --> 30:59.049
Hey, guys. It's Miles, right?

31:00.049 --> 31:01.230
Hi, Miles.

31:01.330 --> 31:03.411
-Can I, um...?
-Yeah.

31:06.012 --> 31:07.312
Hi there.

31:07.412 --> 31:09.413
I'm Dom.

31:10.894 --> 31:13.675
I need you to squeeze both my hands,
OK.

31:13.775 --> 31:15.516
OK.

31:15.616 --> 31:19.097
That feeling of not being able to breathe
is the worst, right?

31:20.098 --> 31:21.398
Excellent.

31:21.498 --> 31:22.799
Hearing you loud and clear.

31:22.899 --> 31:24.880
Now, the key is
I need to find out whether

31:24.980 --> 31:27.401
this feeling's coming from the outside in
or the inside out.

31:27.501 --> 31:29.201
So I need a really big two-handed squeeze

31:29.301 --> 31:31.382
if you're feeling wired
and nothing if you're feeling tired.

31:32.663 --> 31:35.364
OK. This is more like a panic attack.

31:35.464 --> 31:40.566
-So what we need is... Have you got a bag?
-[Miles] Yep.

31:40.666 --> 31:44.728
Hey... [whispers] I have these too.
You'll be fine.

31:44.828 --> 31:45.848
[Miles] Here you go, Dom.

31:45.948 --> 31:49.390
I want you to breathe
into this very high-tech paper bag

31:50.190 --> 31:52.171
and that'll bring
your carbon dioxide levels down

31:52.271 --> 31:55.092
and the world will start looking like
a much happier place.

31:55.192 --> 31:56.373
There you go.

31:56.473 --> 31:58.473
He'll be fine.

31:59.794 --> 32:01.795
[woman] That's it, darling.

32:02.435 --> 32:05.336
A serotonin reuptake inhibitor
would make the flight a whole lot easier,

32:05.436 --> 32:07.177
stop him having another attack
in the air.

32:07.277 --> 32:08.978
[woman] Good boy.

32:09.078 --> 32:11.339
-[Lou] If we hang around for another
two hours waiting for a prescription,

32:11.439 --> 32:12.659
we're gonna miss our flight.

32:12.759 --> 32:14.500
We've got a list of tame pharmacists
on the books.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.221
We can email through a script request.

32:16.321 --> 32:17.781
And picking up?

32:17.881 --> 32:20.743
Tully will be more than happy to
drive into town and get it for you.

32:20.843 --> 32:22.503
Absolutely. Happy as Larry.

32:22.603 --> 32:24.864
-Thank you. That's brilliant.
-It's all part of the service.

32:24.964 --> 32:26.545
You haven't got a tame plumber
on the books as well,

32:26.645 --> 32:29.206
because I've got a shitfight in the
bathroom I don't know what to do about.

32:30.206 --> 32:32.807
[gurgling]

32:34.408 --> 32:36.409
[sigh]

32:37.489 --> 32:39.590
Leave you to it
while I pop down the shops, boss.

32:39.690 --> 32:41.771
Unless you want to swap jobs.

32:59.819 --> 33:01.819
What's going on?

33:03.340 --> 33:05.341
-Tried to call you.
-What?

33:06.141 --> 33:08.882
I ran some more numbers.
I wanted to double check.

33:08.982 --> 33:11.223
-We double checked.
-Triple check.

33:12.424 --> 33:17.086
The CCR5 fertility deletions came out with
a different set of coordinates.

33:17.186 --> 33:20.127
The DNA changes hitched a ride on
the transposons.

33:20.227 --> 33:21.928
I tested it on other insects.

33:22.028 --> 33:25.289
Crosses the species barrier, so...

33:25.389 --> 33:28.830
whatever eats our bug gets its fertility
bombed too.

33:30.271 --> 33:32.312
We're a long way from ready.

33:33.192 --> 33:35.193
We have to push the pause button.

33:37.554 --> 33:39.735
-[Eadie] Hey, it's me again.

33:39.835 --> 33:41.776
Been watching you break the internet.

33:41.876 --> 33:43.336
I'm so proud of you.

33:43.436 --> 33:45.437
Wish I'd been there.

33:47.758 --> 33:50.039
The centre is...

33:51.320 --> 33:53.481
It's tougher going than
I thought it would be.

33:54.681 --> 34:00.043
Anyway, just call me
when you get sick of all the glory.

34:03.044 --> 34:05.045
I love you.

34:15.610 --> 34:17.731
[sombre music]

34:26.774 --> 34:28.515
-[Eadie]<i> Rachel Elleanor Mawson,</i>

34:28.615 --> 34:32.196
<i>born 28th of July 1998.</i>

34:32.296 --> 34:35.778
You had your tonsils out
when you were six.

34:36.778 --> 34:39.740
And you broke your arm playing netball
when you were 13.

34:40.740 --> 34:43.521
Then a back injury two years ago,

34:43.621 --> 34:47.163
after a tractor accident on your farm.

34:47.263 --> 34:50.544
You had surgery to remove
part of a herniated disc.

34:51.624 --> 34:53.625
That's where the Fentanyl came in.

34:54.386 --> 34:57.607
I could find prescriptions for six months.

34:57.707 --> 35:01.468
After that, you must have been
getting them in other ways.

35:08.671 --> 35:12.913
You married Gianni Reece
seven years ago.

35:15.754 --> 35:18.075
He's quite handsome, right?

35:28.600 --> 35:31.201
This is your family home.

35:35.803 --> 35:37.463
It belonged to your mum and dad.

35:37.563 --> 35:39.424
And her mum before that.

35:39.524 --> 35:44.566
Are they alive, um, my parents?

35:48.248 --> 35:50.248
They both passed.

35:53.330 --> 35:56.971
The year after,
you gave birth to Louisa Mae.

36:04.454 --> 36:06.455
She's seven.

36:19.821 --> 36:21.821
What hap...

36:22.782 --> 36:24.242
Do you know where they are?

36:24.342 --> 36:27.404
I put a call in to the Emergency Services
at Ashton.

36:27.504 --> 36:30.405
There was a lot of damage to your house.

36:30.505 --> 36:33.826
So there's a good chance that they're in
one of the evacuation shelters.

36:35.067 --> 36:37.888
I got some things from the hospital

36:37.988 --> 36:41.029
to help take the edge off
some of your withdrawal symptoms.

36:42.590 --> 36:44.591
Start off with a patch.

36:50.193 --> 36:51.374
OK.

36:51.474 --> 36:56.075
Once the withdrawal starts to subside, my
memory's gonna start to come back, right?

37:00.557 --> 37:03.318
[phone rings]
Seriously? Now?

37:05.639 --> 37:07.100
Answer call.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.661
-[Tully]<i> Uh, Dom.</i>

37:08.761 --> 37:10.381
Stopped off for a coffee, have we?

37:10.481 --> 37:12.502
<i>-Yeah, I've stumbled into a situation</i>
<i>here at the pharmacy.</i>

37:12.602 --> 37:13.663
[shouting in background]

37:13.763 --> 37:15.183
<i>Bit of a hold-up actually.</i>
<i>It's alright. Woah, woah!</i>

37:15.283 --> 37:16.344
-Tully?
-[Tully]<i> It's alright.</i>

37:16.444 --> 37:18.225
-[Tully]<i> We can work this out.</i>
-Tully, what's going on?

37:18.325 --> 37:20.325
-[man] Work out?!
-[Tully]<i> Listen!</i> [gun shot]

37:22.566 --> 37:25.007
[tense atmospheric music]

37:32.811 --> 37:38.953
[no audible dialogue]

37:39.053 --> 37:41.054
-[Abel]<i> Welcome, sisters.</i>

37:42.695 --> 37:44.755
<i>Welcome, brothers.</i>

37:44.855 --> 37:47.757
As we come together
to give thanks for what we have,

37:47.857 --> 37:50.338
even in the face of what we have lost.

37:52.058 --> 37:54.039
[solemn music]

37:54.139 --> 37:56.380
[no audible dialogue]

37:59.261 --> 38:02.303
[no audible dialogue]

38:05.464 --> 38:07.465
-[Abel]<i> Some</i> of us have lost homes.

38:08.025 --> 38:10.146
<i>Homes we built or grew up in.</i>

38:11.666 --> 38:15.408
<i>Some have lost possessions,</i>
special things,

38:15.508 --> 38:18.549
sacred things,
handed down over generations.

38:21.551 --> 38:23.551
<i>Some</i> have lost loved ones.

38:24.872 --> 38:27.253
In that loss, that stripping down,

38:27.353 --> 38:30.654
when we lose the things
that say who we are,

38:30.754 --> 38:32.175
who we think we are.

38:32.275 --> 38:35.336
When we don't have the car
that says how much we earn,

38:35.436 --> 38:38.738
<i>or which team we barrack for,</i>

38:38.838 --> 38:40.939
<i>which party we vote for,</i>

38:41.039 --> 38:43.620
<i>what school our kids got into,</i>

38:43.720 --> 38:45.620
<i>what brands we let do our talking</i> for us.

38:45.720 --> 38:49.622
<i>All those things, those attachments,</i>

38:49.722 --> 38:51.823
<i>those aversions,</i>

38:51.923 --> 38:53.964
<i>those stories...</i>

38:59.166 --> 39:03.828
<i>And what's left,</i>
<i>it's not what makes us different.</i>

39:03.928 --> 39:05.929
<i>It's what makes us the same.</i>

39:07.329 --> 39:09.150
And without all that crap...

39:09.250 --> 39:11.251
Sorry, kids.

39:12.772 --> 39:14.872
...we've got a chance of seeing that.

39:14.972 --> 39:18.374
Seeing that we all want the same thing.

39:19.734 --> 39:21.735
We want to be loved.

39:22.415 --> 39:24.416
We want to feel safe.

39:30.299 --> 39:35.201
And it would be easy to despair and
to think where is the sanity in all this,

39:35.301 --> 39:37.322
where is the sense.

39:37.422 --> 39:41.423
And if God floats your boat, maybe you're
asking, "Where is God in all this?"

39:43.984 --> 39:46.926
Maybe in the dark hours of the night,
you're thinking that God is punishing us.

39:47.026 --> 39:48.006
[baby cries]

39:48.106 --> 39:51.968
Or Mother Nature is trying to rid herself
of some overgrown parasitic infection.

39:52.068 --> 39:53.368
[baby cries]

39:53.468 --> 39:55.889
<i>But this, frightening</i>
<i>and destructive as it is...</i>

39:55.989 --> 39:57.810
-[Rachel] It's OK, baby.

39:57.910 --> 39:59.371
...is God lamenting with us.

39:59.471 --> 40:01.652
[baby cries]
-[Rachel]<i> I've got you.</i>

40:01.752 --> 40:06.133
-[Abel] It is the mourning and weeping
of Mother Nature. It's not a punishment.

40:06.233 --> 40:09.415
-[girl]<i> Mumma! Mumma!</i>
It's a message about what we've done

40:09.515 --> 40:11.816
<i>and what we need to do differently.</i>

40:11.916 --> 40:14.137
I've got you. I've got you.

40:14.237 --> 40:16.758
Mummy needs to go for help, OK?

40:17.558 --> 40:19.099
[Abel]<i> Before it goes cold.</i>

40:19.199 --> 40:21.240
I need you to stay here
and look after Daddy.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.982
You sit tight and just stay in the car,
alright?

40:26.082 --> 40:28.703
<i>And before you know it, we'll be home.</i>

40:28.803 --> 40:30.904
<i>We'll have a hot chocolate and a bath.</i>

40:31.004 --> 40:32.664
And your job...

40:32.764 --> 40:37.546
Your job is to think about how many
chapters we read before sleep.

40:37.646 --> 40:39.627
OK?

40:39.727 --> 40:42.428
-[Abel] To give thanks for this day,

40:42.528 --> 40:45.109
to honour those lost,

40:45.209 --> 40:48.771
to appreciate this excellent dinner.

40:51.212 --> 40:52.713
Two, four, six, eight,

40:52.813 --> 40:55.394
bog in, don't wait.
[laughs]

40:55.494 --> 40:59.735
[Rachel whimpers, sobs]

41:05.218 --> 41:07.218
[sombre music]

41:11.060 --> 41:12.561
Rachel?

41:12.661 --> 41:16.342
We ran off the road.
I think I walked for help.

41:17.543 --> 41:19.544
I left them there.

41:20.584 --> 41:22.565
OK. Let me put a call in...

41:22.665 --> 41:26.366
Eadie. The hospital's on the phone.
I think it's urgent.

41:26.466 --> 41:29.548
Thanks. Um, just give me one minute, OK.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.911
[solemn music]

42:03.361 --> 42:05.362
Oh, Bear.

42:12.165 --> 42:14.166
I called his wife on the way here.

42:19.968 --> 42:21.969
I told her he was gonna be OK.

42:28.612 --> 42:30.613
I lied.

42:33.614 --> 42:35.615
The world's gone mad.

42:44.378 --> 42:48.540
[tense music]
