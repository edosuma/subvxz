00:28.361 --> 00:31.262
Aah!

03:09.055 --> 03:11.717
I can't believe
this is happening.

03:12.859 --> 03:17.193
I wish I could see his face
just one last time.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.259
I hope you're in a better place,
my friend.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.277
How you holding up, Jake?

03:37.550 --> 03:39.279
I'm just great, Mike.

03:40.286 --> 03:42.345
Aren't we all
just fucking great?

03:44.224 --> 03:47.785
I feel so much better
now that you guys are here.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.259
What's his problem?

03:53.333 --> 03:54.664
Let it go, Mike.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.328
We're here to pay respect,
remember?

04:00.840 --> 04:03.206
Where's Adam's family?

04:03.276 --> 04:05.437
His mom found him.

04:05.511 --> 04:08.071
I doubt she'll be going
anywhere for a while.

04:08.147 --> 04:10.308
What about his dad?

04:10.383 --> 04:13.944
South America, South Africa.
I can never remember which.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.885
I don't think he's got a dad.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.855
I think he was making it all up.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.225
You all right?

04:21.293 --> 04:22.818
Yeah.

04:22.895 --> 04:26.854
I guess we're the closest thing
he has to family here.

04:28.868 --> 04:31.496
Christ. How many times
do you have to tell a guy?

04:31.571 --> 04:32.868
It's just a stupid game.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.531
Hey.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.041
We were all addicted
to Hellworld, man.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.737
He's right, Mike.

04:38.811 --> 04:41.211
We should've seen this coming.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.807
But we didn't.

04:46.152 --> 04:48.313
We didn't do a damn thing.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.750
We have to live with that now.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.055
Jake.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.432
Jake.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.177
No!
Let go!

06:19.245 --> 06:21.475
Let go!
No!

06:21.547 --> 06:23.014
No!

07:27.146 --> 07:28.943
What's up, Mike?

07:29.015 --> 07:30.039
What?

07:31.317 --> 07:34.514
I paid 100 bucks for this thing
on the Internet.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.986
Didn't it scare you at all?

07:36.055 --> 07:38.114
Mike, Cenobites don't exist.

07:38.191 --> 07:41.592
And even if they did, I never
opened the Lamont Configuration.

07:41.661 --> 07:44.357
Which, as we know,
isn't really real anyway.

07:44.430 --> 07:45.863
You talk the talk pretty good

07:45.932 --> 07:48.696
for someone who's not really
into it anymore.

07:54.106 --> 07:56.097
What are you doing?

07:56.175 --> 07:58.302
Something amazing, Chelse.

07:58.377 --> 08:01.073
Wow.
My curiosity's killing me.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.012
Funny you should ask.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.011
The box. You opened it.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.576
We came.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.781
"Dare to enter hell?"

08:10.857 --> 08:13.325
Now your soul belongs to me.

08:13.392 --> 08:15.383
"You've just been invited
to the fifth annual

08:15.461 --> 08:16.928
secret Hellworld party.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.159
Be at the Leviathan House. "

08:20.233 --> 08:22.292
Leviathan House?

08:22.368 --> 08:25.769
Mike, I'm over it.
We've been through this before.

08:26.939 --> 08:29.737
Oh, what?
So now you're above it all?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.409
You can count me out.

08:32.477 --> 08:34.809
- I have some sights to show you.
- We will.

08:34.881 --> 08:35.643
Please.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.808
You may want to spend
quality time

08:37.884 --> 08:39.442
with the "Hellraiser"
geek brigade.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.179
But Derrick and Allison
would never waste

08:41.254 --> 08:44.485
a perfectly good Friday night
in Hellworld.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.960
The Wall Walker's
right behind you.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.621
I know the Wall Walker is
right behind me.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.221
There you go.
Easy, there, kiddo.

08:53.299 --> 08:54.960
Now go through the door.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.798
I can't believe it! The box!

08:57.870 --> 08:59.098
Oh. Come on.
Open it.

08:59.171 --> 09:00.900
- I'm trying. I'm trying.
- No.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.134
Allison, you're all herky-jerky.
Come here.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.141
You got to finesse it.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.507
Oh, Derrick.

09:05.578 --> 09:09.070
Time to play.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.809
Ooh!

09:12.084 --> 09:13.483
What's your pleasure?

09:13.553 --> 09:16.420
Holy sugar.
We did it!

09:16.489 --> 09:19.788
I'm going to a real, live
secret Hellworld party!

09:19.859 --> 09:21.690
But what about me?

09:22.295 --> 09:24.126
- No guests.
- Welcome to hell.

09:24.196 --> 09:25.857
That's not very fun, is it?

09:25.932 --> 09:28.696
Now move aside.
I can get my own invite.

09:28.768 --> 09:29.860
Okay.

09:30.536 --> 09:31.525
Come to Papa.

09:33.272 --> 09:35.331
I'll tear your soul apart.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.467
Don't tell me
you're going to Hellworld.

09:37.543 --> 09:38.305
Hell, yeah!

09:38.377 --> 09:40.868
Allison, please.
We aren't kids anymore.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.414
Sure you don't want to
check this out?

09:42.481 --> 09:44.278
Hang on, Allison.
Good night, Mike.

09:44.350 --> 09:47.183
I have all eternity
to know your flesh.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.481
- Good night, Mike.
- Come on, Chelse.

09:48.554 --> 09:50.181
- For old times' sake?
- Good night, Mike.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.656
- Website shuts down at midnight.
- Yeah. I'll call.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.057
- Little kiss?
- Good night.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.456
Sorry.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.992
So what if I'm still
into Hellworld?

10:01.067 --> 10:02.534
It's only a party, sweetheart.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.660
That's not the point.

10:03.736 --> 10:07.604
Look, I do find myself bored
and playing it now and again.

10:07.673 --> 10:11.473
But this is like
"Space Voyage" convention crap.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.011
There is a major difference

10:13.079 --> 10:15.377
between Space Voyagers
and Hellraisers.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.678
Hellraisers know how to party.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.310
Reality check. We should've
grown out of this by now.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.217
Reality check.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.846
We're going.

10:23.923 --> 10:26.255
Are you gonna come or not?

10:32.765 --> 10:35.325
Hey, good-lookin'.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.393
About freaking time, boys.

10:39.705 --> 10:40.831
Look at you, sexy.

10:40.906 --> 10:42.703
You like this?
Let me tell you something.

10:42.775 --> 10:44.766
You want to come back here?

10:44.844 --> 10:46.709
Oh, come on, Allison.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.269
At least let me sit up there.

10:48.347 --> 10:51.111
Ohh!
That's gonna leave a bruise.

10:51.183 --> 10:52.411
Yeah, I know.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.715
Oh, leg cramp.
Leg cramp!

10:54.787 --> 10:56.186
Derrick, you're kicking me!

10:57.957 --> 11:00.255
Anybody need a lift?

11:04.797 --> 11:06.458
So, what made you
change your mind?

11:06.532 --> 11:09.296
I just wanted to keep you all
out of trouble.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.461
You've been away from
the Dark Realm awhile.

11:11.537 --> 11:12.629
How'd it feel playing again?

11:12.705 --> 11:15.538
Just like any other
ultraviolent, 24-hour,

11:15.608 --> 11:17.803
wildly popular
yet utterly purposeless,

11:17.877 --> 11:19.902
embraced-by-the-masses,
Internet role-playing game.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.379
All right, Pinhead Junior.

11:22.448 --> 11:26.384
100% mayhem, 0% guilt.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.592
Hellraisers, let's play!

12:16.669 --> 12:18.432
Oh, yeah!

12:18.504 --> 12:21.439
A little something from the
Norman Bates School of Design.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.941
This is such a perfect place
for a Hellworld party!

12:24.009 --> 12:25.340
Let's go.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.572
Let's go raise some hell.

12:27.646 --> 12:29.978
Adam would've loved this.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.646
Whoo!

12:34.720 --> 12:35.709
Hang on.

12:35.788 --> 12:38.586
Chelse, are you coming or what?

12:39.291 --> 12:40.849
Yeah, she's coming.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.223
- Oh!
- Come on.

12:42.294 --> 12:44.228
Mike, put me down!

12:44.296 --> 12:46.230
- Mike!
- Whoo-hoo!

12:46.298 --> 12:47.196
Mike!

12:48.601 --> 12:50.831
Oh, my God.
Look at this.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.131
Yeah.

12:52.204 --> 12:54.570
I like this.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.473
This is so rad!

12:57.543 --> 13:01.309
Oh, this is gonna kick "A"!

13:01.380 --> 13:02.870
Whoo-hoo!

13:08.554 --> 13:11.045
I've died and gone to hell!

13:17.897 --> 13:20.297
Gratuitous tit shot.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.528
Necessary tit shot.

13:22.601 --> 13:25.900
Come along, boys.
Don't be antisocial.

13:36.248 --> 13:39.149
Now, that's what I call
a buzz kill.

13:39.685 --> 13:42.745
Hi! Jake!

13:43.322 --> 13:45.790
Didn't expect to see you here.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.060
What the hell is he doing here?

13:49.128 --> 13:50.823
I haven't seen him
since the funeral.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.660
Who has? I'm not surprised
to see him here.

13:53.732 --> 13:55.529
He got us started
in all this crap.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.125
Even Adam.

13:57.203 --> 13:59.364
Jake blames us for Adam's death.

13:59.438 --> 14:01.065
I blame us for Adam's death.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.301
Come on, guys.
It's just a game.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.071
A crazy fucking Internet game.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.340
It's one thing to play it,
another to live it.

14:08.414 --> 14:11.110
What Adam did was his decision.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.048
End of story.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.608
We're here to have fun, right?

14:14.687 --> 14:15.881
Right?

14:15.955 --> 14:17.081
Jake!

14:17.156 --> 14:19.488
Come on over and join the party.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.888
So, what have you been
up to, Jake?

14:26.966 --> 14:29.127
Trying to forget the past.

14:37.142 --> 14:39.337
Welcome, Hellraisers.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.845
I take it this is your first
time at a Hellworld party.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.609
Invitations.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.414
Outstanding.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.789
May I offer you a drink?

14:52.925 --> 14:54.085
Make yourselves at home.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.423
I have a feeling you're going to
be here for a while.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.895
I'm your host
for the festivities tonight

14:58.964 --> 15:01.194
and perhaps the ultimate
Hellworld fanatic.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.599
Look at this stuff.

15:04.470 --> 15:05.767
You see this?

15:05.838 --> 15:08.033
It's like a "Hellraiser" museum.

15:08.107 --> 15:11.372
I don't think you'll find
a greater collection anywhere.

15:15.047 --> 15:16.571
Who's the pretty kitty?

15:16.649 --> 15:18.139
You're the pretty kitty.

15:18.217 --> 15:21.647
Yes, you are.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.188
Hey, guys.
Five bucks, see your future?

15:28.727 --> 15:29.887
Oh!

15:30.729 --> 15:33.197
This is where the shit hits
the fan, guys.

15:33.265 --> 15:33.959
Ooh.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.467
Did you see this?

15:36.535 --> 15:39.800
Mr. LeMarchand himself!

15:57.923 --> 15:59.185
Mmm!

15:59.258 --> 16:02.421
I wear Eau de Cenobite.

16:03.729 --> 16:04.753
Oh.
Oh, God.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.320
Ow.
That stuff stings.

16:06.398 --> 16:07.660
Oh.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.826
- Derrick!
- What?

16:12.438 --> 16:14.463
May I offer you a drink?

16:15.207 --> 16:17.698
It's from my family's
private stock.

16:17.776 --> 16:20.108
A little ritual
for newcomers only.

16:20.179 --> 16:21.237
Here you go.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.007
Guys?

16:22.081 --> 16:23.878
No.
I don't drink.

16:23.949 --> 16:24.847
I'm driving.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.408
Come on.
Let's not insult the dude.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.249
No insult taken.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.811
Bottoms up.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.753
Knock yourselves out.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.816
Mm.

16:36.595 --> 16:39.257
Holy cow.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.561
That is amazing.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.533
Yes.
It's made out of human skin.

16:43.602 --> 16:45.297
There's no texture
quite like it.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.395
Wow.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.770
This place is all skin
and bones. I love it.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.936
I see you all have a fondness
for the macabre.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.310
There's more
where this came from.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.674
I'd like to show it to you.

17:03.055 --> 17:06.491
I'm an authority on Leviathan
House, Philip LeMarchand's

17:06.558 --> 17:09.459
second greatest
architectural achievement.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.326
I assume you already know
his first greatest.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.390
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here
tonight.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.800
I'm getting goose bumps.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.474
Like most great artists
of his time,

17:28.547 --> 17:31.277
LeMarchand found himself
commissioned by the Church

17:31.350 --> 17:32.476
to build a convent.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.543
And for decades, LeMarchand's
palace stood as such.

17:35.621 --> 17:39.990
Then came the convent's final
mother superior, Sister Ursala.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.688
A nun whose vows were shattered

17:42.761 --> 17:45.161
by an obsession
for a tiny puzzle box

17:45.230 --> 17:48.063
and the unholy pleasures
sealed inside it.

18:01.046 --> 18:04.777
Hey, Derrick!
Man, you got to listen to this.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.083
Sometime during the blizzard
of 1809,

18:12.157 --> 18:15.251
some 80 women vanished
from this house without a trace.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.591
Ursala was the only one
they found.

18:17.663 --> 18:20.223
Only she wasn't all there.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.297
You might say
she went to pieces.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.399
Oh, but...

18:27.773 --> 18:29.798
Years later,
the house was renovated

18:29.875 --> 18:32.571
and became a lockup
for the criminally insane.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.509
From nuns to nuts.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.447
That is, until the staff
began reporting occurrences

18:37.516 --> 18:39.780
of paranormal violence.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.685
So the house is haunted.

18:42.754 --> 18:44.415
Ooh.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.289
Oh, man!

18:51.363 --> 18:53.354
That's what I'm talkin' about!

18:53.432 --> 18:55.127
Whoa.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.395
This is awesome.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.772
Oh!

19:09.848 --> 19:12.180
Oh, man!

19:12.251 --> 19:13.684
One cold spring morning,

19:13.752 --> 19:16.880
the team locked themselves
in this surgical amphitheater,

19:16.955 --> 19:19.355
injected themselves
with a local anesthetic,

19:19.424 --> 19:21.255
and dismembered one another.

19:24.530 --> 19:25.758
So the house is haunted.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.164
I think tonight will bring you
many answers.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.997
Very nice.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.534
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

19:38.610 --> 19:41.875
Often the butchery of
human flesh was so monumental,

19:41.947 --> 19:45.849
they used these devices
to discard the excess.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.386
You mean they chucked
human beings out with this?

19:48.453 --> 19:50.717
No. Bodies.

19:59.231 --> 20:00.926
Forget goose bumps.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.660
My you-know-whats
are getting hard.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.167
Mm.

20:04.236 --> 20:08.104
So, who owns the house today?

20:10.442 --> 20:12.000
You do.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.912
Oh.

20:23.255 --> 20:25.553
Now, that's just wrong.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.123
Whoa!

20:28.193 --> 20:29.626
What the fuck?

20:29.695 --> 20:31.595
Are you all right, Derrick?

20:38.170 --> 20:40.832
Yeah.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.498
Ew.

20:53.352 --> 20:57.288
So, Jake, are you here
with some new friends?

20:57.356 --> 20:58.653
It's a friend.

20:59.224 --> 21:01.021
A girl?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.186
You sound surprised.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.695
No, I'm not surprised at all.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.630
Look.
This isn't a reunion, okay?

21:07.699 --> 21:11.635
I never was one of you guys,
and I never will be.

21:12.337 --> 21:14.396
Same old Jake.

21:17.476 --> 21:19.034
Chelsea.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.450
Have a good time tonight.

21:32.057 --> 21:35.117
You still look
woefully underwhelmed.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.651
Whatever.

21:37.396 --> 21:39.796
Have a high tolerance, do you?

21:40.132 --> 21:44.501
The props are cool,
but this is just an old house.

21:44.569 --> 21:48.300
LeMarchand is a character
from some scary story,

21:48.373 --> 21:52.901
the puzzle box a myth,
and Hellworld is just a game.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.605
Thirsting for something more?

21:54.680 --> 21:56.238
Something I believe.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.010
How about pain?

22:18.970 --> 22:22.269
Adam was right.

22:23.875 --> 22:27.072
Chelsea? Are you okay?

22:27.145 --> 22:27.634
Chelsea?

22:27.713 --> 22:29.374
Hey, take it easy.

22:30.615 --> 22:32.105
You all right?

22:33.385 --> 22:35.046
You stay away from me.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.610
I'll try to contain myself.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.088
Okay.
Everybody just calm down.

22:39.157 --> 22:41.557
Is everything cool, Chelsea?

22:41.626 --> 22:42.957
Yeah.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.254
She hasn't even
started drinking yet.

22:47.332 --> 22:49.323
I think I need some air.

22:52.904 --> 22:54.701
I need a drink.

22:58.443 --> 23:00.536
Hell seekers,
this is your house tonight.

23:00.612 --> 23:03.012
Now, that's
what I'm talkin' about.

23:03.081 --> 23:04.776
What's with the masks, anyway?

23:04.850 --> 23:07.648
Everybody gets a mask
and a cellphone.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.778
Each mask has
a four-digit number on it.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.584
If you wish to engage
in the pleasures

23:11.656 --> 23:13.647
that only flesh can bring,

23:13.725 --> 23:17.661
you pick a tasty morsel
and dial that number.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.663
Sweet.

23:19.731 --> 23:20.993
Anonymous debauchery.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.057
Ooh. I like this already.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.466
God.
A day in the life of you guys.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.529
Does nothing ever change?

23:28.607 --> 23:31.633
Much as I love watching
old wounds being opened,

23:31.710 --> 23:33.177
I do have other guests.

23:33.245 --> 23:37.739
But if you need anything,
just scream.

23:37.816 --> 23:41.115
So, Jake, still haven't found
your date?

23:41.186 --> 23:44.121
For your information,
I met her on-line.

23:44.189 --> 23:47.716
Oh, so you don't even know
what she looks like.

23:48.393 --> 23:50.918
What kind of
chat-room-challenged moron

23:50.996 --> 23:52.725
do you think I am?

23:54.466 --> 23:56.434
That's why I'm here.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.003
This ought to be fun.

24:10.315 --> 24:14.075
Can you hear me now?

24:15.053 --> 24:16.680
Can you hear me now?

24:41.146 --> 24:42.807
Three shots over here.

24:42.881 --> 24:44.644
Lot of talent here.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.412
What?

24:46.485 --> 24:48.385
A lot of...

24:49.321 --> 24:51.380
A lot of talent here tonight.

24:51.456 --> 24:53.356
Go get some.

24:53.425 --> 24:55.359
Oh, yeah!

24:56.828 --> 25:01.026
You know, as in,
you should go get some.

25:10.575 --> 25:12.543
Oh. Oh.

25:13.078 --> 25:14.477
Yeah.

25:14.546 --> 25:16.036
Good luck.

25:18.049 --> 25:19.880
You're gonna need it.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.984
Don't you have
anything better to do?

25:27.058 --> 25:29.754
Oh, I'm enjoying myself, Jake.

25:29.828 --> 25:31.921
I'm not hurting anybody.

25:31.997 --> 25:33.760
The only way you guys
ever enjoy yourselves

25:33.832 --> 25:35.129
is when you're hurting somebody.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.531
You never change, do you?

25:36.601 --> 25:38.159
I told my date about you guys.

25:38.236 --> 25:40.602
Don't be surprised
if she's not exactly friendly.

25:40.672 --> 25:45.109
You are not guilting me into
having a crummy time tonight.

25:46.778 --> 25:49.542
We didn't earn your hatred,
Jake.

25:49.614 --> 25:50.774
None of us earned it.

25:50.849 --> 25:53.283
You guys don't earn anything.

25:53.351 --> 25:55.012
You just take it.

26:06.598 --> 26:09.396
It then became a lockup
for the criminally insane.

26:10.569 --> 26:14.061
I'm a bit of an authority
on Leviathan House.

26:14.139 --> 26:16.539
God damn, y'all are fine.

26:16.608 --> 26:19.202
Oh. Yeah.
Excuse me.

26:20.445 --> 26:22.140
I'll be right back.

26:24.616 --> 26:27.210
I'm not Mr. Right,
but I'm Mr. Right Now.

26:27.285 --> 26:29.845
Oh, goody.
These things actually work.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.411
Thanks, Derrick.

26:32.958 --> 26:33.788
What the...

26:35.126 --> 26:37.060
Oh.

26:37.128 --> 26:38.652
Ladies?

26:38.730 --> 26:40.595
Damn it, Allison!

26:46.805 --> 26:48.238
Oh, yeah.

27:01.886 --> 27:05.117
So, here we are again.
Just the two of us.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.021
Just the two of us.

27:14.766 --> 27:15.755
I see.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.768
So, how long has it been now?

27:17.836 --> 27:19.201
Two years?

27:19.804 --> 27:22.432
You're still holding a torch
for a guy

27:22.507 --> 27:25.340
who you're never gonna get
a second chance with.

27:27.879 --> 27:29.813
He's dead, Chelse.

27:30.882 --> 27:32.440
Move on.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.881
You know what, Mike?
Have a great time tonight.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.421
Go fuck somebody.

27:37.489 --> 27:42.290
But when you sober up,
I expect an apology.

27:45.930 --> 27:48.797
Well, that went well.

27:51.269 --> 27:53.863
Whoa!
Hey, baby.

27:56.207 --> 27:58.266
You know what would
look good on you?

27:59.678 --> 28:00.770
Me.

28:00.845 --> 28:01.937
Whoa. Whoa.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.674
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ooh.

28:03.748 --> 28:05.306
Enjoy the party.

28:05.383 --> 28:07.180
Asshole.

28:16.261 --> 28:17.819
Hey, baby.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.127
Hey, baby.

28:31.476 --> 28:32.909
Hi.

28:33.478 --> 28:34.843
Bye.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.250
Yeah, right.

28:40.318 --> 28:42.479
As if.

29:07.345 --> 29:10.041
Hey.
How's it hangin'?

29:12.684 --> 29:15.482
Ooh.
Don't answer that.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.425
Hello.

29:42.647 --> 29:45.946
Kids, don't try this at home.

30:08.673 --> 30:12.734
The sacrificer is quite becoming
on you, Allison.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.938
Get this thing off me.

30:15.013 --> 30:18.574
It's been used to drain
the blood of Hellworld explorers

30:18.650 --> 30:21.881
since Leviathan himself first
spoke the realm into being.

30:21.953 --> 30:25.218
There is no faster way
to bleed a human

30:25.290 --> 30:26.723
without decapitating him.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.425
Please get this thing
off me now.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.091
Relax. Relax.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.292
It's perfectly safe.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.365
Unless the cutting blades
are engaged.

30:46.477 --> 30:48.877
The cutting blades are engaged.

30:56.654 --> 30:58.281
Someone.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.618
No!

30:59.691 --> 31:01.386
No!
Please don't leave me!

31:01.459 --> 31:03.552
No! No!

31:33.224 --> 31:37.285
Chelsea!

31:37.362 --> 31:40.627
Do you believe Adam now,
Allison?

32:12.563 --> 32:13.723
Allison?

32:17.669 --> 32:19.227
Allison?

33:01.546 --> 33:03.070
Hello?

33:06.117 --> 33:07.709
Hello?

33:13.624 --> 33:15.319
Adam?

33:21.132 --> 33:22.997
What the hell?

33:31.976 --> 33:33.102
Hey!

33:33.177 --> 33:35.042
Hey!
Open up!

33:35.747 --> 33:37.408
Let me out!

33:38.149 --> 33:39.980
Shit.

34:27.431 --> 34:28.592
Adam.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.373
"It's just a game"?

34:36.908 --> 34:39.069
You're a bright one,
aren't you, kid?

34:40.378 --> 34:41.969
Not like the others.

34:43.047 --> 34:45.038
Where'd you get this?

34:45.116 --> 34:46.344
How do you know Adam?

34:46.417 --> 34:49.112
Adam was a very talented player.

34:50.254 --> 34:53.621
In fact, he was so passionate
about Hellworld...

34:57.428 --> 35:02.889
...that he made this
with his own hands.

35:25.223 --> 35:27.054
Go ahead.
Open it.

35:41.038 --> 35:42.369
It's not real.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.600
It's...

35:53.251 --> 35:57.745
Is it just a game now, Jake?

37:22.406 --> 37:25.068
I'd love to see your puzzle box.

37:26.544 --> 37:28.307
Want to dance?

37:29.547 --> 37:30.912
Want to party?

37:45.496 --> 37:48.397
Hey, how you doing?
Can I have a drink, please?

37:51.402 --> 37:53.336
Sir, I'll take a drink.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.174
Some party, huh?

37:59.744 --> 38:01.234
Thanks.

38:04.815 --> 38:06.806
Fucking asshole.

38:10.254 --> 38:13.155
Whoa.

38:15.459 --> 38:17.120
Anyone see this?

38:23.634 --> 38:24.601
Hey.

38:24.669 --> 38:27.001
Jake.
How you doing?

38:28.072 --> 38:30.836
Listen.
I was just wondering what...

38:36.580 --> 38:38.571
So sorry about that.

38:39.183 --> 38:42.175
Hey, how you doing?
When'd you get into Hellworld?

38:42.753 --> 38:43.947
Hello?

38:44.021 --> 38:45.750
What's going on?
Hello.

38:45.823 --> 38:48.485
What's going on here?

38:48.559 --> 38:50.049
Guys.

38:52.029 --> 38:54.497
What the fuck, man?

38:56.300 --> 38:58.996
Hey.
Guys?

38:59.070 --> 38:59.968
Hello?

39:00.037 --> 39:02.699
Is everybody ignoring me?

39:02.773 --> 39:04.035
Is this a joke?

39:04.108 --> 39:06.542
Is this a big fucking joke?

39:07.845 --> 39:10.211
Hey. Hey!

39:11.982 --> 39:13.609
Hello?

39:16.153 --> 39:17.745
Fuck this.

39:26.797 --> 39:29.357
What a great party.

39:49.019 --> 39:50.850
Ah!

39:50.921 --> 39:52.183
Yeah.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.448
Yes.

40:43.574 --> 40:44.541
No!

40:45.376 --> 40:46.365
No!

41:08.899 --> 41:11.265
Can't disappoint my fans.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.030
Hey, baby.
What's your name?

41:14.104 --> 41:15.867
Mike, it's Chelsea.
Listen.

41:15.940 --> 41:18.534
I am locked inside a room
on the second floor,

41:18.609 --> 41:20.941
and I need you to come up
and help me.

41:21.011 --> 41:22.808
Oh, so now you want me?

41:22.880 --> 41:25.075
Mike, look,
I'm not messing around here.

41:25.149 --> 41:28.846
There's something really strange
going on in this house.

41:28.919 --> 41:31.387
Well, maybe you shouldn't have
blown me off.

41:33.290 --> 41:33.949
Please.

41:34.024 --> 41:35.855
Would you please come up
and help me?

41:35.926 --> 41:38.520
I'm serious!
I need your help!

41:38.596 --> 41:40.223
What's wrong with you, Mike?

41:40.297 --> 41:41.628
Mike?

41:53.878 --> 41:55.368
Great.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.223
Fuck!

42:13.964 --> 42:15.659
What's the matter?

42:35.052 --> 42:36.986
Oh, shit!

49:44.681 --> 49:47.047
- Allison, thank God.
- Chelsea!

49:47.117 --> 49:49.642
Help me!
Chelse!

49:49.720 --> 49:52.211
Allison, if you and Mike
are fucking with me,

49:52.289 --> 49:53.517
so help me, God.

49:53.590 --> 49:55.524
Chelsea, help me!

49:55.592 --> 49:58.288
And I thought you had
a high threshold.

49:58.362 --> 50:01.559
Don't worry about Allison.
You'll see her again.

50:01.631 --> 50:03.030
Sooner than you think.

50:10.040 --> 50:12.270
Welcome to Hellworld, Chelsea.

50:30.861 --> 50:32.761
911. What's your emergency?

50:32.829 --> 50:35.320
I need help.
I'm at 86 Hillbound Drive.

50:52.149 --> 50:55.380
Are you there?
I can't hear you. Hello?

51:20.210 --> 51:21.802
Can I help you, fellas?

51:23.046 --> 51:24.479
Hey, there.

51:24.548 --> 51:26.140
Sorry to bother you
at this hour.

51:26.216 --> 51:27.706
It's all right.

51:28.852 --> 51:30.012
I think.

51:30.087 --> 51:33.284
We just got a call.
Probably a prank.

51:33.356 --> 51:35.017
Young woman says her friends

51:35.092 --> 51:36.684
are being taken hostage
or something.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.422
I'm entertaining some guests
here tonight.

51:40.363 --> 51:42.661
She sounded whacked
out of her gourd.

51:44.367 --> 51:46.028
Do you mind if we look around?

51:46.103 --> 51:47.900
I'd rather you didn't.

51:49.272 --> 51:51.001
Scare away my guests.

51:51.074 --> 51:52.405
Hey!

51:52.476 --> 51:54.137
Up here!

51:55.212 --> 51:56.645
I have a reputation to uphold.

51:56.713 --> 51:58.738
I don't want some drugged-out
chick tarnishing it.

51:58.815 --> 52:00.248
Up here!

52:02.552 --> 52:05.680
Officer,
I have Ms. Murdoch on the line.

52:05.755 --> 52:07.052
This is Officer Riley.

52:07.124 --> 52:10.252
I'm at the big house now.
Where are you?

52:10.327 --> 52:13.660
I'm upstairs by the window,
just above the veranda.

52:18.802 --> 52:21.794
I'm looking up at the window
right now.

52:21.872 --> 52:23.601
I don't see a damn thing.

52:23.673 --> 52:25.538
What the fuck
are you talking about?

52:25.609 --> 52:28.009
I'm right here!
Look!

52:28.078 --> 52:29.170
Look!

52:29.246 --> 52:30.907
- Definitely drugs.
- Hey!

52:30.981 --> 52:33.142
Probably speed or meth.

52:33.216 --> 52:34.808
Come back!

52:37.053 --> 52:38.384
Hey!

52:38.455 --> 52:40.116
Up here!

52:42.359 --> 52:43.348
Hey!

52:43.927 --> 52:44.757
Look!

52:45.328 --> 52:49.765
I'm rerouting you
back to Dispatch.

52:49.833 --> 52:51.425
I don't believe this.

52:51.501 --> 52:52.763
Dispatch.

52:52.836 --> 52:54.360
This is Officer Riley.

52:54.437 --> 52:56.200
Did the trace come up
with anything?

52:56.273 --> 52:58.468
Yeah. The call
came from your number.

52:58.542 --> 52:59.566
No shit.

52:59.643 --> 53:01.270
Yeah.
Somebody's pulling your leg.

53:01.344 --> 53:03.403
They're always one step ahead.

53:03.480 --> 53:06.244
Okay, guys. We're going home.
Prank call.

53:12.622 --> 53:15.284
Apparently she was calling me
from my phone.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.622
These kids and their gadgets.

53:17.694 --> 53:19.025
I don't want to sound nosy.

53:19.095 --> 53:20.995
But what's a guy like you do

53:21.064 --> 53:23.726
with a big house
like this, anyhow?

53:25.635 --> 53:27.967
I love to party.

53:35.278 --> 53:37.610
I believe you owe me one.

53:37.681 --> 53:39.012
Come on, stud.

53:39.082 --> 53:41.642
It's your turn to go down.

53:58.001 --> 53:59.696
Up here!

54:00.604 --> 54:01.593
Up!

54:01.671 --> 54:03.696
Look up!

54:05.041 --> 54:06.702
Up here!

55:14.878 --> 55:16.846
That's gonna bruise.

55:23.386 --> 55:26.651
Easy, sweet cheeks.
You're gonna bruise my tonsils.

55:48.611 --> 55:50.875
That's not cool.

55:50.947 --> 55:52.539
Open up.

55:52.615 --> 55:54.583
Get in here.

55:55.919 --> 55:56.977
Hello?

55:59.723 --> 56:02.317
Come on. Open up.
This is not fair.

56:04.728 --> 56:06.423
Hey!
Where are you going?

56:06.496 --> 56:08.327
Don't leave me in here!

56:13.069 --> 56:14.866
Fuck.

56:40.697 --> 56:42.187
Props.

56:43.466 --> 56:45.093
Just props.

56:50.373 --> 56:52.500
Damn good props.

56:53.276 --> 56:54.800
Just...

56:56.613 --> 56:58.103
props.

57:08.291 --> 57:09.724
Of course.

57:09.793 --> 57:11.317
Latex.

57:18.468 --> 57:20.163
Even put it
in Derrick's clothes.

57:20.236 --> 57:21.635
Nice touch.

57:30.046 --> 57:31.411
Derrick?

57:34.717 --> 57:36.344
Derrick?

57:49.265 --> 57:51.096
Oh, shit!

57:52.235 --> 57:53.099
Fuck!

57:55.104 --> 57:56.696
Oh.

58:15.258 --> 58:16.748
Hello?

58:19.095 --> 58:20.995
Anybody?

58:25.435 --> 58:27.528
Somebody.

58:31.274 --> 58:33.071
Sweet cheeks?

58:52.462 --> 58:53.622
Not good.

59:07.343 --> 59:08.776
Please!

59:08.845 --> 59:09.812
No!

59:17.554 --> 59:18.521
Please!

59:18.588 --> 59:19.816
No!

59:34.203 --> 59:37.468
This is just the beginning.

59:45.081 --> 59:46.412
Hey!

59:46.482 --> 59:47.881
Wait!

59:51.220 --> 59:52.448
Over here!

59:54.023 --> 59:55.650
Come back!

59:56.426 --> 59:58.291
No!
Wait!

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.833
Oh, come on!

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.437
Please.

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:17.178
Come on!

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:18.907
Like a bad horror movie,
isn't it?

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:46.841
Come on, guys.
It's just a game.

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:50.545
A crazy fucking Internet game.

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:56.881
Adam was a very talented player.

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.587
None of us could've seen him

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.685
taking the game
as far as he did.

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:15.095
Aah!

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.102
What Adam did was his decision.

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:27.578
We should've seen this coming.

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:37.021
Not real!

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:52.238
Hey! Easy, now!
Whoa!

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:54.776
Hold on. Everything's fine.
Easy, easy, easy.

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.277
Ho.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:57.937
Hey, I'm a cop.
Easy, now.

01:01:58.014 --> 01:02:00.505
Are you the girl
who called for help?

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:01.515
What's your name?

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:02.915
Chelsea.

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.577
What the hell
are you doing out here?

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:06.417
There's something strange
happening in that house.

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.286
Something terrible
happened to my friends.

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:09.619
You've got to believe me.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:10.989
I believe you, Chelsea.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.460
This isn't the first time
I've had to come out here.

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.861
There's something
about that house.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.696
Hang on.

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.962
Dispatch, this is Unit 12.

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:22.061
Dispatch.
What's your situation?

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:24.663
I'm at the old house.

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:33.674
You still don't understand,
do you?

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.548
There is no way out for you,
Chelsea.

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:40.815
Oh, what wonders
we have to show you.

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:48.686
Chelsea!

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.357
- Jake!
- Chelsea, it's Jake!

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.628
Chelsea, it's coming.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:55.296
Don't leave me here, Chelsea.
Don't leave me here!

01:02:55.371 --> 01:02:57.464
I'm at the house, Chelsea.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.472
Chelsea, please!

01:02:58.541 --> 01:02:59.735
- Jake, hold on.
- Oh, my God!

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:02.141
Don't leave me here!

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:05.409
Don't leave me here.

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:07.312
Oh, my God, no.
They're coming.

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:09.874
Please don't leave me here.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.421
Jake!

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:24.396
Jake!

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:29.364
Jake!

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.864
Chelsea!

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.873
Jake!

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:38.311
Jake, hold on!

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:40.909
Where are you?

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:42.473
Chelsea?

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:44.819
Chelsea!

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:48.923
Hello?

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:52.094
Chelsea!

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.028
Chelsea?

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:58.458
Shit.

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:02.868
Chelsea.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.600
Jake!
Are you okay?

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.107
What happened?

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.200
No. I'm fine.
I'm fine.

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:10.040
What are you talking about?

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:12.706
There's something majorly wrong
going on here.

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.306
No shit.
Where is everybody?

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:17.045
I haven't seen anyone.
Have you?

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:19.053
No.
Nobody.

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.986
And I mean nobody.

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:23.321
It's this house, Jake.

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.256
It's like it's playing with us.

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:31.323
It's haunting us.

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:36.236
Not if I can help it.

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.758
That better be you, Mike.

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:07.427
Not this time, Chelse.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.296
Great party.

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:14.275
Welcome to motherfucking
Hellworld, Chelsea.

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:16.940
No!

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:19.004
Get away from me!

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:22.476
Come on, Chelse.
Let's raise some hell.

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:24.314
Leave me alone!

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:25.979
Adam was right, Chelse.

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:28.023
No!

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.063
Come on, Chelse!

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:36.655
It's what we've always wanted.

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.723
You want me, Chelse.

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.029
You know you want me.

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:42.070
Game over, Chelsea!

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:44.197
Only you and Jake left.

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:46.570
No!

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:58.049
Stop!

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:18.668
Oh, God!

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:19.799
God.

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:34.380
Hello.

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:36.254
Hello, Chelsea.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:40.489
I hope this night is everything
you dreamed it could be.

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:42.690
How obviously cryptic that was.

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:44.665
Why don't I
just call you Pinhead?

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.827
If that's what
you want to think.

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:49.632
So you are Pinhead, right?
Let me guess.

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.070
You're going to rip off
your face

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.870
and morph into some
franchise icon, right?

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:56.036
You don't know Hellworld
from your ass.

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:57.101
How come you're in it?

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:59.113
Get your mythology right, buddy.

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.808
First, I have to open the box.

01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:03.147
Then, Pinhead appears.
The hooks and chains.

01:07:03.219 --> 01:07:04.811
But none of that's happened.
Why?

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.855
Because none of it's real.

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:08.549
You'll come to believe it,
Chelsea.

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:11.821
I'll say this much.
It is about a box.

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.637
"Come to the party.
Come to the party. "

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.354
No!

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.662
Chelsea.

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:29.970
I'm sorry.

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:32.064
Why?

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.733
I didn't know.

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:34.707
I'm sorry.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.542
Chelsea?

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:40.377
Please don't die.

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:16.513
What the fuck is going on?
Who the fuck is this?

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:18.051
Whoa! Jake!
Calm down!

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.849
It's just me, Chelsea.

01:09:19.921 --> 01:09:21.752
What happened?

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.563
I just killed you.

01:09:30.131 --> 01:09:31.064
Huh?

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:33.658
I just killed you.

01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:35.397
You just died in my arms.

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:38.127
Oh, Jake.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:41.142
Can I ask you a stupid question?

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:43.234
Could this place be a portal?

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:45.542
I mean to the real Hellworld.

01:09:45.613 --> 01:09:47.206
Somebody wants us
to believe that.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.080
That's for sure.

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:51.412
I'm not buying it.

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:55.082
I mean, where's the engineers?
Where are the jailers?

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:58.354
Now, Pinhead is just supposed to
show up and take your soul away.

01:09:58.427 --> 01:09:59.689
That's it.

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.491
It's not adding up.

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.158
Maybe we're already dead.

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:08.100
No, Chelsea.
Nobody opened up the box.

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:11.105
Suppose it has nothing to do
with the box, Jake.

01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:14.870
Suppose we're in hell
because we belong here.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:16.469
For what?

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.273
For not saving Adam.

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:22.214
From who?

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:23.615
From himself.

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:25.449
From Hellworld.

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:28.949
Chelsea, none of us thought
he would take it that far.

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:31.549
We knew what Hellworld
was doing to Adam.

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:33.527
But we kept on playing it.

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:35.723
That was nobody's fault.

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:40.000
If this is hell,
none of us belong in it.

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:46.373
Well, I'm starting to think
we may not make it out, Jake.

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:49.036
At the rate we're going,

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:52.603
we might not make it long enough
to see the sun rise.

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:55.941
Chelse, when we get out
of this place,

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:59.283
I promise you the most
beautiful sunrise ever.

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:01.323
You're on, Jake.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:04.919
Where are you?

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.794
I locked myself in the attic.

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:11.731
You don't even want to know why.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.290
Okay.
Sit tight.

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:14.927
I'm on my way.

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:25.238
It's from my family's
private stock.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.875
Come on.
Let's not insult the dude.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.044
No insult taken.

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.517
Knock yourselves out.

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:46.895
Ow!

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.844
Welcome, Hellraisers.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.372
Invitations.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.681
Oh, shit.

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:49.890
Oh, shit.

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:57.803
Chelsea.

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:08.312
Come here, Chelsea.

01:13:13.088 --> 01:13:15.318
Come here.

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:27.134
It's just a game, Chelsea.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.268
Adam?

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:48.620
Adam?

01:13:56.732 --> 01:13:58.063
Jake!

01:13:58.133 --> 01:14:00.124
Jake!
Help!

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:02.461
Chelsea!

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:05.572
No!

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:07.040
Jake!

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.303
Chelsea!

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:10.836
- Jake, he's got me!
- Chelsea!

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:11.845
Help!

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:13.472
Whatever it is,
don't believe it.

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:16.211
It's not real!
It's all in your head!

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:19.220
It's whatever you're afraid of!
Don't be afraid!

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:21.586
He's not letting go!

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:24.717
You have to believe me!
It's not happening!

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:27.318
Chelsea, it's not real!

01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:36.863
Chelsea!

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:41.334
Jake!

01:14:46.615 --> 01:14:47.445
Chelsea.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:52.250
It's okay.
Listen, Chelsea.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.414
This whole Hellworld thing
has been one big trap.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.082
We've been brought here
for some reason.

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.455
I don't know why, but...

01:14:57.526 --> 01:14:58.584
Jake.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.595
It's Adam's dad.

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:04.162
What?

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.937
No.

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:15.567
It can't be.

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:18.340
It's Adam's dad, Jake.

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:22.282
It can't be.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.285
No, it is.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.617
Do you want to stick around
for any more surprises?

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:28.588
Let's go!

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.361
Leaving so soon,
without even saying goodbye?

01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:44.233
Goodbye.

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:45.637
Asshole.

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:53.772
Damn!

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:56.482
Go, Chelse.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.918
Let's get out of here!

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:04.155
Let's go!
Move!

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:08.323
Oh, God!

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.024
Let's go!

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:16.366
Go!

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:17.462
No.
This way.

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:18.198
Boo.

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:41.558
What is it, Jake?

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:47.667
What is it?

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:49.294
It's us.

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:53.908
You ought to
pat yourself on the back, Jake.

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:56.740
Everything worked out
just like you said it would.

01:16:57.946 --> 01:17:00.437
No.
I had nothing to do with this.

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:01.743
No, no, no, no.

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:03.717
I got to give credit
where credit's due.

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.013
The rest of them, I knew,

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:07.351
would respond
to a private-party invitation.

01:17:07.422 --> 01:17:09.788
But you I wasn't sure about.

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.091
No.

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:16.261
I had to lure you out.

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:19.300
And I found you, Jake,
on the Internet.

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:21.199
In the Hellworld chat room.

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:23.464
You did it all for me.

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:28.639
Oh, the things a young man
will tell a prospective lover.

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:32.209
The myth of LeMarchand.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.941
The puzzle box.

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:35.210
Hellworld.

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:37.911
How the game itself would be
the perfect weapon

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:39.647
to do everybody in.

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:41.450
I take my hat off to you.

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:44.048
I couldn't have done it
without you, Jake.

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:45.354
You couldn't have done this.

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:46.689
Oh, yes, I could.

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:50.357
Call it poetic justice for
the people that buried my son.

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:52.730
You sick son of a bitch!

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:55.463
You were never even there
for your own son!

01:17:57.205 --> 01:17:59.002
Your son spent his life

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:01.440
waiting for a father
who never came home!

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:04.206
You didn't even go
to his fucking funeral!

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:09.280
That kid took 16 years
of loneliness to his grave.

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:12.843
And now you want to come back
and get revenge on us?

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:16.313
We were the only family
Adam ever had.

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:20.054
You still think you have
a fighting chance, don't you?

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:24.093
No! No!

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:25.565
Fuck!

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:28.435
Get me out!

01:18:28.503 --> 01:18:29.435
Chelsea!

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:30.596
Let me out!
Chelsea!

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:32.401
- Can you hear me?
- Jake!

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:37.004
Chelsea! Let me out!
Let me out!

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:39.980
Oh, my God!

01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:41.811
I can practically smell
the terror

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:43.441
coursing through your veins.

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:44.917
Why?

01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:46.613
Why did you do this?

01:18:46.688 --> 01:18:47.655
Revenge.

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:54.893
You and your friends
were right all along.

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.762
Hellworld never really
even existed.

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.664
It was in your mind
the whole time.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.794
Don't!

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.668
Even this very moment.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.872
You believe me now, don't you?

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:12.380
You and your friends have been
six feet under since this began.

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:20.348
Sodium amytal is a drug that
induces a highly impressionable,

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.014
trancelike euphoria.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:24.524
It can be taken in every
which way you can imagine.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.185
No!

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:28.195
You can inhale it.

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:31.494
You can touch it.

01:19:31.566 --> 01:19:34.364
- Ingest it.
- No! Please.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.529
You and your friend Jake
were reluctant

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:38.129
to sample my free gifts.

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:39.036
Fuck!

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.808
I had to take you by force.

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:49.245
Chelsea!

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:56.754
Once you were drugged,
you were under my spell.

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.630
I buried you.

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:07.156
Each in separate coffins
with cellphone at hand.

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:10.762
With ventilation
so you wouldn't run out of air

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:13.501
and miss out on all that
sweet suffering.

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:26.514
It was through these cellphones

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:29.284
I could communicate
subliminal suggestions.

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:37.031
Your own fertile imaginations
did the rest.

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:38.759
Chelsea!

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:49.610
There were freak-outs,
confessions, negotiations,

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.908
orgasms, surrenders.

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:59.283
Your own guilt-ridden conscience
even threw Adam in there.

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.753
Chelsea.

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:03.586
What a pleasant surprise
that was.

01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:05.489
It was all so exhausting.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.222
I barely had enough energy
to go back and enjoy myself

01:21:08.296 --> 01:21:09.285
at the party.

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:12.424
I figured, "Why not?

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.900
Why not enjoy myself?"

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:27.671
There were a few unexpected
casualties along the way.

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:29.717
Allison severely gouged herself

01:21:29.784 --> 01:21:32.116
trying to claw off
her imaginary neck device

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:34.018
and then bled to death.

01:21:35.857 --> 01:21:37.950
Derrick's asthma took him out.

01:21:44.699 --> 01:21:46.326
And Mike?

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:50.736
He died of good old-fashioned
drop-dead fear.

01:21:59.547 --> 01:22:03.608
You know what makes
my revenge so sweet?

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:06.279
I beat you guys
at your own game.

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:08.447
We loved him.

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:10.855
We didn't deserve this.

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:14.156
Tell him that when you see him.

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:18.832
Your dream's over, Chelsea.

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.367
No!

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:22.926
Your nightmare is
just about to begin.

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:25.202
No!

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:27.138
See you in hell.

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:29.199
No!

01:22:32.247 --> 01:22:33.214
Goodbye, Chelsea.

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:00.533
Come on, guys.

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:01.768
No!

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:03.902
- You're all right.
- No! No!

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:05.241
Let go of me!

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:06.712
- Get off!
- You're okay.

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:08.373
- It's all right.
- You're safe.

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:10.509
- Get off me!
- Let's go.

01:23:10.585 --> 01:23:12.576
No!

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.212
You're safe.

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:16.189
You're safe now.

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:17.781
You're safe!

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:19.724
Stop!
Stop.

01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:23.621
- Oh, my God! No!
- Hey.

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:27.200
You don't need to see.
You don't need to see that.

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:28.462
- Come on.
- No!

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:29.468
Come on.

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:30.868
No!

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:57.092
Oh, God!
Jake!

01:23:57.165 --> 01:24:00.464
Oh, my God!
Jake, are you okay?

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:02.969
Jake!

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.471
Oh.

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:09.009
Wow.
What a party.

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:11.045
We made it, Jake.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:14.974
We made it out.

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:18.913
Guess I owe you that sunrise.

01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:44.939
You're very lucky, you know.

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:47.072
We almost gave up on you.

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:50.340
I don't understand.

01:24:50.418 --> 01:24:52.010
You've been missing for days.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:54.180
And somebody made a call
a little while ago.

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:55.779
We traced the call
to this location.

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:59.884
I'm sorry to say the house owner
cleared out a few days ago.

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:02.259
Covered his tracks
pretty good, too.

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:05.094
Don't worry.
We'll catch him.

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:06.957
He's gone?

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:11.070
But then, how'd you find us?
Who made the call?

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:13.630
Traced the signal
right to this very spot.

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:17.701
Damndest thing.
We'd have never have found you.

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:20.714
Your cellphone was found
up at the house.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:25.915
Maybe the owner made the call,
but I doubt it.

01:25:25.987 --> 01:25:27.181
I don't get it.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.019
Welcome.

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:44.187
Welcome to hell.

01:27:49.831 --> 01:27:50.957
This is not happening.

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:53.933
Seeing is believing.

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:58.735
I should've come for you
a long time ago.

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:02.105
Hellworld.
There's no Hellworld.

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:03.268
It doesn't exist.

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:05.244
Your son was quite the prodigy.

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:08.373
He opened the gateway to hell.

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:12.010
But you never believed yourself,
did you?

01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:19.221
Got to wake up.

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:24.422
I got to wake up.

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.237
I got to wake up.

01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:33.606
Wake up!

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:50.451
How's that for a wake-up call?

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.198
Chicago.

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.368
No.
No. It's too cold.

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:08.537
Miami.

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:10.372
Typical male.

01:29:10.445 --> 01:29:13.846
Yeah. Well,
this typical male delivers.

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:15.109
Check it out.

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.958
Hello?

01:29:31.966 --> 01:29:33.456
Hello?

01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:35.468
Hello, Chelsea.

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:39.465
Jake.
