00:46.147 --> 00:47.312
- It's alarming how people
kind of, like, feel

00:47.314 --> 00:50.382
like they need to,
like, educate you.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.817
- Mm-hmm.
- About what you're doing.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.653
Makes you want to, like,
spitefully just eat junk.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.622

- Just to be like, [bleep] you.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.424

and they're eating, like,
the last scoop of rice

01:01.128 --> 01:01.794

01:01.796 --> 01:03.862
should we eat this bug

[laughs]

01:12.306 --> 01:15.407
[hums]

01:15.409 --> 01:16.208
Hello.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.810
I'm Tess Lynch
and today,

01:17.812 --> 01:21.413
we are gonna talk
about the artichoke wars.

01:21.415 --> 01:26.285
<i>Our story begins</i>
<i>in New York City, 1935.</i>

01:26.287 --> 01:27.386
<i>So, there had been one group</i>

01:27.388 --> 01:30.522
<i>that have been diehard fans</i>
<i>of the artichoke</i>

01:30.524 --> 01:32.324
<i>and that is</i>
<i>the Italian immigrants.</i>

01:32.326 --> 01:34.760
<i>They're bananas</i>
<i>over this stuff.</i>

01:34.762 --> 01:35.694
<i>The Italians are like,</i>

01:35.696 --> 01:37.629
<i>we're ride or die</i>
<i>for these artichokes.</i>

01:37.631 --> 01:38.697
<i>These artichokes are fantastic.</i>

01:38.699 --> 01:40.299
<i>You can do it--butter cars</i>

01:40.301 --> 01:41.333
<i>that just drive butter</i>
<i>into your mouth,</i>

01:41.335 --> 01:45.170
but it was also not great.

01:45.172 --> 01:45.737
<i>Ciro Terranova--</i>

01:45.739 --> 01:46.839
<i>- Ciro or Churro?</i>

01:46.841 --> 01:49.374
- It's Ciro but you could--you
know, friends call him Churro.

01:49.376 --> 01:52.578
Well, only when he's
sprinkled with powdered sugar.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.812
<i>I guess really it's</i>
<i>sugar and cinnamon.</i>

01:53.814 --> 01:56.348
It's like, to be,
you know, authentic.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.685
So Ciro Terranova
is the underboss

01:59.687 --> 02:00.752
<i>of the Morello crime family.</i>

02:00.754 --> 02:03.222
<i>He was kind of dabbling</i>
<i>in everything.</i>

02:03.224 --> 02:05.491
<i>I mean, like,</i>
<i>there were plenty of murders.</i>

02:05.493 --> 02:06.725
<i>I'll tell you that.</i>
<i>- Mm.</i>

02:06.727 --> 02:07.759
<i>- And there was plenty</i>
<i>of corruption</i>

02:07.761 --> 02:09.194
<i>and there was racketeering.</i>

02:09.196 --> 02:13.732
<i>Like, you know, his--his finger</i>
<i>was in every pie,</i>

02:13.734 --> 02:14.600
but the end of prohibition

02:14.602 --> 02:17.903
<i>is really costing the Mafia</i>
<i>like, a ton of money.</i>

02:17.905 --> 02:18.937
<i>Booze is legal again.</i>

02:18.939 --> 02:20.472
<i>It's like, ooh,</i>
<i>what are we gonna do?</i>

02:20.474 --> 02:22.941
<i>So Ciro's like,</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

02:22.943 --> 02:26.178
<i>Like, I could just</i>
<i>grab all these artichokes</i>

02:26.180 --> 02:26.879
<i>and sell 'em.</i>

02:26.881 --> 02:30.549
<i>So he's going to the farmers</i>
<i>Northern California.</i>

02:30.551 --> 02:31.483
<i>He's threatening them.</i>

02:31.485 --> 02:34.419
<i>He's saying, I'm gonna</i>
<i>crack your skulls</i>

02:34.421 --> 02:36.522
<i>if you don't give me</i>
<i>your artichokes.</i>

02:36.524 --> 02:38.190
<i>They're saying</i>
<i>whoa, whoa buddy.</i>

02:38.192 --> 02:40.325
<i>Best step off 'cause you're</i>
<i>terrifying as [bleep].</i>

02:40.327 --> 02:43.395
And he has taken
these artichokes

02:43.397 --> 02:44.863
and he has a complete monopoly.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.199
<i>He's bullying the vendors</i>
<i>in New York City</i>

02:47.201 --> 02:48.867
<i>and he's bullying the customers</i>

02:48.869 --> 02:51.570
<i>by driving the prices</i>
<i>through the roof.</i>

02:51.572 --> 02:54.339
<i>Luckily mayor</i>
<i>Fiorello La Guardia,</i>

02:54.341 --> 02:55.607
<i>The Little Flower--</i>

02:55.609 --> 02:56.642
- Why The Little Flower?

02:56.644 --> 02:57.576
Why did he have that name?

02:57.578 --> 03:00.879
- He's really small
and Fiorello means flower.

03:00.881 --> 03:01.880
Little Flower.
- Makes sense.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.316
<i>- And, like,</i>
<i>La Guardia is Italian,</i>

03:04.318 --> 03:09.288
so he--in his genetic makeup
loves the artichoke.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.389
<i>I need to do something.</i>

03:10.391 --> 03:11.390
<i>I need to do something.</i>

03:11.392 --> 03:13.392
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

03:13.394 --> 03:15.494
What he does is,
he gets his advisors

03:15.496 --> 03:17.529
and he's like,
we need to hatch a plan.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.730
<i>It has to be a secret plan</i>

03:18.732 --> 03:19.998
<i>and it has to be a flashy plan</i>

03:20.000 --> 03:21.400
<i>because we're dealing</i>
<i>with the mob here</i>

03:21.402 --> 03:24.870
<i>and I'm just, like,</i>
<i>a little flower of a man.</i>

03:24.872 --> 03:25.671
<i>- I like a flashy plan.</i>

03:25.673 --> 03:28.273
<i>- Yeah, well, you got</i>
<i>to have a flashy plan,</i>

03:28.275 --> 03:30.876
<i>otherwise it's not--no,</i>
<i>it might work</i>

03:30.878 --> 03:31.877
<i>if it's not flashy,</i>

03:31.879 --> 03:34.279
<i>but what's the point</i>
<i>if it's not flashy?</i>

03:34.281 --> 03:35.981
<i>'Cause you're not gonna</i>
<i>go down in history</i>

03:35.983 --> 03:38.550
<i>if don't have a flashy plan.</i>

03:38.552 --> 03:41.019
December 22, 1935,

03:41.021 --> 03:43.422
<i>La Guardia enters</i>
<i>the Bronx Terminal Market.</i>

03:43.424 --> 03:47.526
<i>And he's got all his guys,</i>
<i>all his squad, with him.</i>

03:47.528 --> 03:49.461
♪ All his squad,
all his squad ♪

03:49.463 --> 03:50.963
<i>♪ For the artichoke,</i>
<i>all his squad ♪</i>

03:50.965 --> 03:55.500
<i>And he goes in and he's like,</i>
<i>okay, trumpet guy, pssht,</i>

03:55.502 --> 03:57.803
<i>you're gonna play your thing,</i>
<i>go ahead.</i>

03:57.805 --> 03:59.438
<i>And the guy comes out</i>
<i>and it's just like...</i>

03:59.440 --> 04:00.439
<i>[hums]</i>

04:00.441 --> 04:02.441
<i>And he's like,</i>
<i>oh, it's out of tune.</i>

04:02.443 --> 04:03.408
<i>December in New York.</i>

04:03.410 --> 04:05.310
<i>Get the hell out of here.</i>

04:05.312 --> 04:06.812
<i>Warm up your trumpet.</i>
<i>Time out.</i>

04:06.814 --> 04:07.913
And the guy goes inside
and he comes out

04:07.915 --> 04:09.581
and then he's like...

04:09.583 --> 04:11.583
<i>[hums]</i>

04:11.585 --> 04:12.317
<i>And it's great.</i>

04:12.319 --> 04:13.852
<i>La Guardia reads</i>
<i>from the scroll</i>

04:13.854 --> 04:16.321
<i>and he's like, everybody.</i>

04:16.323 --> 04:17.556
<i>Listen.</i>

04:17.558 --> 04:19.825
<i>We ain't gonna have these</i>

04:19.827 --> 04:22.728
<i>punks, racketeers, or thugs</i>

04:22.730 --> 04:27.799
<i>taking our mother[bleep]</i>
<i>artichokes away from us.</i>

04:27.801 --> 04:28.934
<i>And everyone's like,</i>
<i>[bleep] yeah,</i>

04:28.936 --> 04:32.904
<i>We're gonna scoop Hollandaise</i>
<i>tonight, son!</i>

04:32.906 --> 04:34.306
<i>And he's like, that's right.</i>

04:34.308 --> 04:37.776
<i>You cannot sell or possess</i>
<i>any artichokes</i>

04:37.778 --> 04:40.379
<i>until we legitimize this sale.</i>

04:40.381 --> 04:44.416
<i>Fiorello La Guardia</i>
<i>goes back to his house,</i>

04:44.418 --> 04:46.551
<i>has a cookie,</i>
<i>glass of milk, but then,</i>

04:46.553 --> 04:51.056
<i>all of the five biggest</i>
<i>California artichoke vendors,</i>

04:51.058 --> 04:54.760
<i>they're like, we are not</i>
<i>selling any--this is terrible.</i>

04:54.762 --> 04:56.495
<i>This is even worse</i>
<i>than dealing with the mob guy.</i>

04:56.497 --> 04:57.429
<i>We have to reach an agreement.</i>

04:57.431 --> 04:59.998
<i>They--they basically sit down</i>
<i>with La Guardia</i>

05:00.000 --> 05:02.501
<i>and they're like, look,</i>
<i>we're gonna sit down</i>

05:02.503 --> 05:03.068
<i>and make a deal</i>

05:03.070 --> 05:05.537
<i>but you've got to protect us</i>
<i>from this [bleep] mob.</i>

05:05.539 --> 05:09.775
<i>And La Guardia's like,</i>
<i>you know what?</i>

05:09.777 --> 05:10.375
<i>Okay.</i>

05:10.377 --> 05:12.544
<i>I can [bleep] protect you</i>
<i>from the mob.</i>

05:12.546 --> 05:14.546
<i>Okay, so several hours pass.</i>

05:14.548 --> 05:17.983
<i>Blah blah blah blah blah,</i>
<i>blah blah blah blah blah,</i>

05:17.985 --> 05:19.418
<i>no no no,</i>
<i>yes yes yes,</i>

05:19.420 --> 05:21.453
<i>then they're like, okay.</i>

05:21.455 --> 05:22.921
<i>Sign the agreement.</i>

05:22.923 --> 05:23.989
<i>♪ Ba ba ba ♪</i>

05:23.991 --> 05:25.490
<i>There it is.</i>

05:25.492 --> 05:27.492
<i>December 29, the ban is lifted.</i>

05:27.494 --> 05:30.028
<i>Artichokes are back</i>
<i>on the menu.</i>

05:30.030 --> 05:31.763
<i>They've gotten</i>
<i>all this publicity</i>

05:31.765 --> 05:33.699
<i>so even non-Italians</i>

05:33.701 --> 05:37.069
<i>who were very disdainful</i>
<i>of artichokes before</i>

05:37.071 --> 05:39.538
<i>are like,</i>
<i>we're gonna give those a shot.</i>

05:39.540 --> 05:40.405
<i>I mean, these are like,</i>

05:40.407 --> 05:44.543
<i>everybody's going to such great</i>
<i>lengths about the artichokes.</i>

05:44.545 --> 05:45.911
<i>We'll try them.</i>
<i>[sniffs]</i>

05:45.913 --> 05:49.681
Ciro Terranova
has been dethroned

05:49.683 --> 05:50.682
<i>as the artichoke king.</i>

05:50.684 --> 05:52.551
<i>He's arrested every time</i>
<i>he's in Manhattan</i>

05:52.553 --> 05:54.419
<i>for being a vagrant</i>
<i>'cause everyone's like,</i>

05:54.421 --> 05:56.588
<i>huh, artichoke king,</i>
<i>blah blah blah, loser.</i>

05:56.590 --> 06:02.761
<i>La Guardia, remembered as one</i>
<i>of the most beloved mayors</i>

06:02.763 --> 06:04.029
<i>in New York history,</i>

06:04.031 --> 06:07.499
<i>reportedly liked his artichokes</i>
<i>with mayonnaise.</i>

06:07.501 --> 06:09.000
<i>That's his one flaw.</i>

06:09.002 --> 06:09.835
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

06:09.837 --> 06:10.836
Just made you throw up,
didn't I?

06:10.838 --> 06:11.837
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I know.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.872
- Mm-hmm.
- That's my goal.

06:13.874 --> 06:18.076
- Hon, artichoke's ready.

06:18.078 --> 06:18.677
- [laughs]

06:18.679 --> 06:21.179
- This is actually really good.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.582
- Well, it's not good.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.717
It's not good.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.518
This is terrible.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.020
<i>- [laughs]</i>

06:32.125 --> 06:33.692
- You guys,
I'm a little tips.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.694
- Mm-hmm.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.696
- Hello, I am Lyric Lewis.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.698
Wait.
Let me take that again.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.699
Okay.

06:40.701 --> 06:41.666
Hello.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.769
No, okay.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.237
Hello, I'm Lyric Lewis

06:45.239 --> 06:48.707
and today we are talking
about Julia Child.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.710
- To Julia.
- To Julia.

06:51.712 --> 06:55.013
<i>So, Julia,</i>
<i>she had a very humdrum life.</i>

06:55.015 --> 06:56.281
<i>She's like, super tall.</i>

06:56.283 --> 06:57.149
<i>She's 6'3".</i>

06:57.151 --> 06:58.617
<i>She's like, dumb tall.</i>

06:58.619 --> 07:01.753
<i>Julia never ate anything</i>
<i>but canned or processed food,</i>

07:01.755 --> 07:03.989
<i>but then she's like,</i>
<i>you know what?</i>

07:03.991 --> 07:04.823
<i>[bleep] this.</i>

07:04.825 --> 07:06.591
<i>She's like,</i>
<i>I'm gonna be a spy.</i>

07:06.593 --> 07:07.025
<i>Ba-blam.</i>

07:07.027 --> 07:09.561
<i>So she applies to be a spy</i>
<i>for the OSS,</i>

07:09.563 --> 07:13.098
<i>which is the Office</i>
<i>of--[belches]</i>

07:13.100 --> 07:14.099
Oh, God.

07:14.101 --> 07:14.466
Ugh.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.836
<i>Um, the Office</i>
<i>of Strategic Serdises.</i>

07:17.838 --> 07:20.005
<i>The Office</i>
<i>of Strategic Services</i>

07:20.007 --> 07:23.108
<i>in Washington, DC, which will</i>
<i>later become the CIA.</i>

07:23.110 --> 07:23.742
<i>Boom.</i>

07:23.744 --> 07:25.076
So, one day her boss
comes to her

07:25.078 --> 07:26.211
and her boss is like, yo,

07:26.213 --> 07:27.779
<i>I need you to come up</i>
<i>with shark repellent</i>

07:27.781 --> 07:30.348
<i>for bombs underwater.</i>

07:30.350 --> 07:31.750
<i>But that was, like,</i>
<i>her fist glimpse into cooking</i>

07:31.752 --> 07:33.819
<i>and into, like, espionage work,</i>

07:33.821 --> 07:36.154
<i>so she gets a bowl,</i>
<i>she mixes up shark repellent.</i>

07:36.156 --> 07:37.823
<i>She's like, I'm gonna add glue,</i>
<i>stick some bombs,</i>

07:37.825 --> 07:40.025
<i>she's like,</i>
<i>I'm gonna add some gun powder.</i>

07:40.027 --> 07:41.960
<i>And she's like,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna add blood</i>

07:41.962 --> 07:42.994
<i>because sharks will like blood.</i>

07:42.996 --> 07:44.896
<i>She adds stuff that's,</i>
<i>like, against blood.</i>

07:44.898 --> 07:47.065
<i>The sharks are like,</i>
<i>I don't want to--</i>

07:47.067 --> 07:48.166
<i>[nibbles]</i>
<i>I don't want to bite it.</i>

07:48.168 --> 07:51.336
<i>And Julia's like, cool cool</i>
<i>cool, tight tight tight.</i>

07:51.338 --> 07:52.304
<i>[belches]</i>

07:52.306 --> 07:54.072
Oh, excuse me.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.640
So...
[pops tongue]

07:55.642 --> 07:58.009
Later comes 1944.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.011
<i>She volunteers to go</i>
<i>to Sri Lanka.</i>

08:00.013 --> 08:01.046
<i>Sri Lanka's like,</i>
<i>hey girl, hey.</i>

08:01.048 --> 08:02.781
<i>And she's a secretary</i>
<i>for this office</i>

08:02.783 --> 08:04.249
<i>where they're working</i>
<i>for American soldiers</i>

08:04.251 --> 08:06.918
<i>in guerilla warfare,</i>
<i>so she's like, doing that shit.</i>

08:06.920 --> 08:08.019
<i>So it's, like,</i>
<i>kinda gritty</i>

08:08.021 --> 08:09.354
<i>but it's still, like,</i>
<i>a secretary</i>

08:09.356 --> 08:12.390
<i>but she's like, yeah,</i>
<i>what paperwork?</i>

08:12.392 --> 08:14.693
She's 31 and she's ready
for a man

08:14.695 --> 08:17.996
<i>to get up in all 6--</i>
<i>6 feet, 3 inches of that.</i>

08:17.998 --> 08:20.899
<i>She's like,</i>
<i>I'm ready to mingle.</i>

08:20.901 --> 08:22.868
<i>She's like, I'm ready</i>
<i>for a penis in every position.</i>

08:22.870 --> 08:25.871
<i>Julia's like,</i>
<i>super horny.</i>

08:25.873 --> 08:27.772
- Hey now.
- Right?

08:27.774 --> 08:29.374
<i>And she looks up</i>
<i>and she sees Paul.</i>

08:29.376 --> 08:30.909
<i>She sees Paul.</i>
<i>Paul is a vision to her.</i>

08:30.911 --> 08:34.646
<i>He's a tall,</i>
<i>tall drink of water.</i>

08:34.648 --> 08:35.347
<i>Tall glass of milk.</i>

08:35.349 --> 08:39.417
<i>Tall glass of almond milk</i>
<i>if you're a vegan.</i>

08:39.419 --> 08:43.288
<i>Tall glass of soy milk</i>
<i>if you're a vegetarian.</i>

08:43.290 --> 08:47.759
Tall glass of goat milk
if you don't like cows.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.693
- [snickers]

08:48.695 --> 08:51.363
<i>- And Julia's like, that is</i>
<i>a man and I got to get him.</i>

08:51.365 --> 08:52.764
<i>He's like a nerd.</i>

08:52.766 --> 08:53.798
<i>Paul's like, hey, everybody.</i>

08:53.800 --> 08:55.834
<i>Who wants to play</i>
<i>Scrabble later?</i>

08:55.836 --> 08:57.369
<i>Ha ha ha!</i>

08:57.371 --> 09:00.171
<i>And Julia's like,</i>
<i>you don't even know</i>

09:00.173 --> 09:01.206
<i>how sexy you are, Paul.</i>

09:01.208 --> 09:03.008
<i>I will drink your bathwater.</i>

09:03.010 --> 09:07.112
Julia before Paul,
she only ate processed food,

09:07.114 --> 09:08.113
<i>canned foods,</i>
<i>creamed corn,</i>

09:08.115 --> 09:10.115
<i>everything out of a can</i>
<i>so Paul was like,</i>

09:10.117 --> 09:15.320
<i>your palate is so [bleep] basic</i>
<i>and I'm showing you a new life.</i>

09:15.322 --> 09:18.123
<i>So they ate</i>
<i>all these exotic foods together</i>

09:18.125 --> 09:19.257
<i>and Julia was like,</i>
<i>[bleep] me,</i>

09:19.259 --> 09:21.293
<i>and Paul was like, yes, bitch,</i>
<i>where have you been?</i>

09:21.295 --> 09:22.861
<i>She was like, oh, my God,</i>
<i>this man is amazing.</i>

09:22.863 --> 09:24.996
<i>My palate is developing.</i>

09:24.998 --> 09:27.132
<i>I'm into him</i>
<i>and she was feeling him</i>

09:27.134 --> 09:29.901
<i>and Paul was like,</i>
<i>no, not yet.</i>

09:29.903 --> 09:32.437
<i>Because I'm feeling</i>
<i>Jane Foster now.</i>

09:32.439 --> 09:34.806
<i>Jane is a [bleep] spy.</i>

09:34.808 --> 09:35.473
Like, she's a spy.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.474
Do you hear me?
She's a [bleep] spy.

09:36.476 --> 09:37.976
<i>Jane is, like,</i>
<i>out in the field.</i>

09:37.978 --> 09:38.977
<i>She's [bleep] shooting people.</i>

09:38.979 --> 09:43.048
<i>Paul, he liked Jane a lot</i>
<i>because she was sexy,</i>

09:43.050 --> 09:44.883
<i>and Julia was doing office work</i>
<i>so it's like,</i>

09:44.885 --> 09:46.718
who wants the pencil pusher

09:46.720 --> 09:51.222
when you can get the maker
of the wood?

09:51.224 --> 09:55.026
'Cause I feel like Jane
was making wood, right?

09:56.028 --> 09:58.096
[laughs]

09:58.098 --> 10:00.932
<i>Jane was like,</i>
<i>no, you're mad corny to me.</i>

10:00.934 --> 10:01.566
<i>But we're friends.</i>

10:01.568 --> 10:04.035
<i>So they're hanging out</i>
<i>and then Paul,</i>

10:04.037 --> 10:05.070
<i>he looks at Julia</i>
<i>and he's like,</i>

10:05.072 --> 10:10.775
<i>Julia, you tall but you cute,</i>
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

10:10.777 --> 10:12.744
<i>So Julia was like, yes.</i>

10:12.746 --> 10:14.079
<i>Paul, I want to continue this.</i>

10:14.081 --> 10:15.046
<i>We need to take a road trip</i>

10:15.048 --> 10:17.248
<i>because that's how people</i>
<i>really get to know each other</i>

10:17.250 --> 10:18.450
<i>and know if they want</i>
<i>to be together.</i>

10:18.452 --> 10:21.786
<i>And Paul was like, cool cool</i>
<i>cool, tight tight tight.</i>

10:21.788 --> 10:23.822
So then at the end of the war,
they went back home.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.924
<i>They pack her Buick</i>
<i>full of clothing</i>

10:25.926 --> 10:28.827
<i>and then she's like,</i>
<i>oh, I'm gonna pack</i>

10:28.829 --> 10:31.463
<i>a soup thermos</i>
<i>full of pre-mixed martinis.</i>

10:31.465 --> 10:34.032
<i>And a bottle of vodka because</i>
<i>this is back in the day</i>

10:34.034 --> 10:36.167
when there was
no open container laws,

10:36.169 --> 10:38.870
so they set off
and Paul is like, yes!

10:38.872 --> 10:40.939
<i>Julia is like, yes!</i>

10:40.941 --> 10:42.807
<i>The police on the road</i>
<i>I'm sure are like,</i>

10:42.809 --> 10:45.076
<i>yes, girl, go get your man!</i>

10:45.078 --> 10:45.577
<i>- [laughs]</i>

10:45.579 --> 10:49.214
<i>- So they fell in love</i>
<i>and they got married.</i>

10:49.216 --> 10:50.081
<i>Him and Julia was like,</i>

10:50.083 --> 10:51.483
<i>okay, cool cool cool,</i>
<i>tight tight tight,</i>

10:51.485 --> 10:53.118
<i>and then they get</i>
<i>to go to France.</i>

10:53.120 --> 10:54.319
<i>So she goes to France</i>
<i>and she's like,</i>

10:54.321 --> 10:57.555
<i>what is all this food,</i>
<i>this croissants, these--</i>

10:57.557 --> 10:58.423
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

10:58.425 --> 11:00.225
<i>Like, these espressos</i>
<i>and stuff like that.</i>

11:00.227 --> 11:01.092
<i>She's like, the chicken.</i>

11:01.094 --> 11:03.495
And so she enrolls
in Le Cordon Bleu

11:03.497 --> 11:04.229
of all places.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.398
<i>And she's like,</i>
<i>doing all these French foods</i>

11:06.400 --> 11:07.365
<i>and they come back to America,</i>

11:07.367 --> 11:09.901
and this--this late--
this late in the game

11:09.903 --> 11:13.505
is when Julia Child
that we know comes to life.

11:13.507 --> 11:17.108
<i>She has all these books,</i>
<i>she's huge on TV.</i>

11:17.110 --> 11:20.945
<i>We have the French</i>
<i>culinary know-how</i>

11:20.947 --> 11:21.980
<i>that we got from Julia Child.</i>

11:21.982 --> 11:25.417
<i>Paul is like, cool,</i>
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

11:25.419 --> 11:27.385
<i>She's a big bitch</i>
<i>but I love her.</i>

11:27.387 --> 11:29.521
<i>He was an amazing husband</i>
<i>to her.</i>

11:29.523 --> 11:30.822
<i>He loved her.</i>

11:30.824 --> 11:31.456
<i>She was an Amazon.</i>

11:31.458 --> 11:32.290
<i>He loved her.</i>

11:32.292 --> 11:34.993
- Did you ever see the website
that he created for her?

11:34.995 --> 11:36.494
- No.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.496
- You've never been
to amazon.com?

11:38.498 --> 11:39.531
- Shut your mouth.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.433
- Well, 'cause you
called her Amazon.

11:41.435 --> 11:42.967
- Shut your mouth, Derek.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.235
I--I thought it was
a real website

11:44.237 --> 11:46.604
dedicated to Julia Child
by Paul Child and like,

11:46.606 --> 11:47.372
he was like,

11:47.374 --> 11:51.843
"She's a Big Bitch
But I Love Her Volume Five."

11:51.845 --> 11:53.011
<i>And so they were very happy</i>

11:53.013 --> 11:55.046
<i>and she became</i>
<i>this huge success,</i>

11:55.048 --> 11:59.884
<i>and it was all because</i>
<i>of Julia's career as a spy</i>

11:59.886 --> 12:03.555
<i>in espionage</i>
<i>and because of Paul Child.</i>

12:03.557 --> 12:05.890
<i>Bing bang boom.</i>

12:05.892 --> 12:06.858
[belches]

12:06.860 --> 12:07.492
I keep--I'm so sorry.

12:07.494 --> 12:08.893
I'm so embarrassed.
I keep burping.

12:08.895 --> 12:09.527
- Why?

12:09.529 --> 12:11.930
- 'Cause ladies don't burp
and I try to be a lady.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.131
- But it'll also be on TV

12:13.133 --> 12:13.898
and it'll be great.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.202
- And then people will be like,
she's a real person.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.337
Cool cool cool
tight tight tight.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.010
- What are you drinking?
Molasses? You wanna--

12:26.012 --> 12:28.146
- Have you ever
had molasses?

12:28.148 --> 12:29.047
- Yeah, I hate it.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.115
There was one time
when I was growing up

12:30.117 --> 12:32.317
and I was a little kid
and my dad had gotten, like,

12:32.319 --> 12:33.318
some molasses
and he made pancakes

12:33.320 --> 12:36.187
and I was like,
pancake night!

12:36.189 --> 12:38.223
And so I just dumped it
so it just like--

12:38.225 --> 12:42.494
was like, huge just black pile
on my plate and I--it was,

12:42.496 --> 12:44.496
like, the most bitter gr--
I was like,

12:44.498 --> 12:45.497
oh, this is
the greatest thing ever.

12:45.499 --> 12:48.099
But no, no no no, no no.
No.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.368
It's [bleep] deadly.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.503
- Anything can kill you.

12:51.505 --> 12:52.704
- Anything can kill you.

12:52.706 --> 12:53.671
- Cheers.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.273
[laughter]

12:55.275 --> 12:57.575
- Hello, I'm Lucius Dillon,

12:57.577 --> 13:03.648
and today we're going to talk
about the Great Molasses Flood.

13:04.283 --> 13:09.721
My story starts--our story
starts at--19--hmm, hmm, hmm.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.422
Our story starts at 1915.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.058
<i>So the Purity Distillery,</i>
<i>which was in North Boston</i>

13:14.060 --> 13:17.128
<i>in this area,</i>
<i>is a very industrial area.</i>

13:17.130 --> 13:20.732
<i>There was a bunch of Italian,</i>
<i>Irish immigrants</i>

13:20.734 --> 13:21.599
<i>all living in this area.</i>

13:21.601 --> 13:25.303
<i>Molasses was</i>
<i>a big mother[bleep] deal.</i>

13:25.305 --> 13:27.605
<i>When they distilled it</i>
<i>it would turn into rum,</i>

13:27.607 --> 13:32.143
so it was a huge commodity, but
prohibition was coming around.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.713
<i>But there's</i>
<i>a year-long grace period</i>

13:35.715 --> 13:36.748
<i>so they came up</i>
<i>with a great idea.</i>

13:36.750 --> 13:41.352
<i>It was like, okay, what we can</i>
<i>do is, for a whole year,</i>

13:41.354 --> 13:45.690
<i>we can make as much liquor</i>
<i>and rum and everything,</i>

13:45.692 --> 13:50.495
<i>so let's just get as much</i>
<i>[bleep] molasses as we can.</i>

13:50.497 --> 13:54.232
<i>You know what,</i>
<i>we need to build a huge tank</i>

13:54.234 --> 13:57.268
<i>that could fill</i>
<i>all this lovely molasses.</i>

13:57.270 --> 13:59.070
So they got a guy

13:59.072 --> 14:01.105
<i>who was the treasurer</i>
<i>of the company, Arthur Jell.</i>

14:01.107 --> 14:04.242
<i>And they're like, uh, have you</i>
<i>had any architect experience?</i>

14:04.244 --> 14:08.146
<i>Have you any--any</i>
<i>engineering education?</i>

14:08.148 --> 14:09.080
<i>Nope, nope.</i>

14:09.082 --> 14:11.783
<i>Uh, they're like, hey,</i>
<i>can you read this blueprint?</i>

14:11.785 --> 14:13.184
<i>Uh, why do I need to read</i>
<i>this blueprint?</i>

14:13.186 --> 14:17.255
<i>That--that goes for the guys</i>
<i>in the hats and the--</i>

14:17.257 --> 14:18.623
<i>The construction workers?</i>

14:18.625 --> 14:19.257
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:19.259 --> 14:20.391
<i>The construction workers.</i>

14:20.393 --> 14:21.492
<i>They can read it.</i>

14:21.494 --> 14:22.594
<i>It's fine.</i>

14:22.596 --> 14:23.795
<i>All right, you're our guy.</i>
<i>Great.</i>

14:23.797 --> 14:25.263
<i>So he didn't know</i>
<i>what the [bleep] he was doing.</i>

14:25.265 --> 14:28.833
Any corner that needed
to be cut, he cut it.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.169
<i>So they built this thing</i>
<i>very terribly.</i>

14:31.171 --> 14:36.708
They would hear groans
and gurgles from this tank.

14:36.710 --> 14:41.813
It was like...
[groans]

14:41.815 --> 14:42.814
[snorts]

14:42.816 --> 14:43.348
[laughs]

14:43.350 --> 14:47.285
<i>[groaning]</i>

14:48.554 --> 14:49.721
- Like it was--
it was gonna barf.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.589
- It's gonna pretty much puke.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.858
<i>So near the tank</i>
<i>was Engine Number 31,</i>

14:53.860 --> 14:57.262
<i>and in that firehouse</i>
<i>was a bunch of firemen,</i>

14:57.264 --> 15:00.298
<i>so we had Bill Connor,</i>
<i>who was the chief.</i>

15:00.300 --> 15:03.735
<i>We had George Layhe,</i>
<i>and around lunchtime, you know,</i>

15:03.737 --> 15:07.305
<i>every day, they would</i>
<i>get together, play billiards.</i>

15:07.307 --> 15:09.240
There was a stonecutter
who would come by

15:09.242 --> 15:11.376
<i>named John Barry,</i>
<i>who would just liked to come</i>

15:11.378 --> 15:14.178
<i>every now and again,</i>
<i>and he was like,</i>

15:14.180 --> 15:18.416
<i>look, I--I'm really worried</i>
<i>that this tank's gonna--</i>

15:18.418 --> 15:20.251
it's gonna explode.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.720
I mean, of course
the thing leaks immediately

15:22.722 --> 15:24.622
<i>and Arthur Jell was like,</i>
<i>it's fine.</i>

15:24.624 --> 15:26.658
<i>This is still</i>
<i>a solid structure.</i>

15:26.660 --> 15:29.294
And everyone was like,
but you can see leaks

15:29.296 --> 15:30.762
<i>from the tank.</i>

15:30.764 --> 15:32.897
<i>Okay, well, uh,</i>
<i>we can fix that.</i>

15:32.899 --> 15:33.798
<i>We'll paint it brown</i>

15:33.800 --> 15:36.334
<i>so you can't see the molasses</i>
<i>coming out.</i>

15:36.336 --> 15:36.935
<i>What?</i>

15:36.937 --> 15:37.902
<i>That doesn't help anything.</i>

15:37.904 --> 15:39.370
<i>I'm so worried</i>
<i>that this is gonna fail.</i>

15:39.372 --> 15:42.273
<i>Arthur Jell was like,</i>
<i>we're gonna make</i>

15:42.275 --> 15:45.276
<i>a bazillion dollars</i>
<i>off of this.</i>

15:45.278 --> 15:46.277
<i>- What could possibly go wrong?</i>

15:46.279 --> 15:49.814
<i>- What could possibly</i>

15:49.816 --> 15:52.283
go wrong?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.451
- Don't do that shit.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.752
- Why does it scare you so much?

15:54.754 --> 15:57.522
- 'Cause it makes me
have to try to attempt--

15:57.524 --> 15:58.656
- I know, you can't do it.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.591
But I'm gonna do it
for a little bit.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.760
- Well then,
I want to do it too.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.963
- Okay.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.864
Yeah, see?

16:06.866 --> 16:07.732
Good work.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.201
So, it was January 15, 1919,

16:10.203 --> 16:13.404
<i>and the</i>
<i>Purity Distilling Company</i>

16:13.406 --> 16:15.640
<i>filled this [bleep]</i>
<i>to the brim.</i>

16:15.642 --> 16:16.507
<i>This tank fills</i>

16:16.509 --> 16:20.478
<i>2.3 million gallons</i>

16:20.480 --> 16:22.447
<i>of this crap.</i>

16:22.449 --> 16:23.381
- [gasps]

16:23.383 --> 16:25.750
- Look at you!

16:25.752 --> 16:27.986
Look at you.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.555
Not--no, I'm still here.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.523
Uh...
[laughs]

16:32.525 --> 16:33.591
You're so embarrassed.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.727
You're so embarrassed.

16:35.729 --> 16:38.629
Anyway...um...

16:38.631 --> 16:40.665
so around lunchtime

16:40.667 --> 16:43.368
<i>at Fire Station 31,</i>

16:43.370 --> 16:45.536
<i>they heard just like</i>
<i>this horrible explosion.</i>

16:45.538 --> 16:46.871
<i>It was kind of like a...</i>

16:46.873 --> 16:48.406
[imitates explosion]

16:48.408 --> 16:49.407
<i>[imitating squirting]</i>

16:49.409 --> 16:51.709
Maybe not as much of a duck,

16:51.711 --> 16:54.812
but they heard
a horrible sound.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.414
<i>That was not good.</i>

16:56.416 --> 17:00.385
<i>So John Barry went up</i>
<i>to the window.</i>

17:00.387 --> 17:03.321
<i>The tank burst.</i>

17:03.323 --> 17:05.757
<i>Then this sort of huge wave,</i>

17:05.759 --> 17:08.559
was like a...
[imitates explosion]

17:08.561 --> 17:09.961
Of--oh, excuse me.

17:09.963 --> 17:15.299
<i>Of just pure force</i>
<i>and evil and terror.</i>

17:15.301 --> 17:16.367
It knocked down buildings.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.403
<i>It knocked down railway cars.</i>

17:18.405 --> 17:20.438
<i>And people were just, like,</i>
<i>knocked off their ass.</i>

17:20.440 --> 17:23.441
It was also horses
because of the time period

17:23.443 --> 17:25.710
that, like, these horses
were knocked on their ass.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.913
<i>The horses were like,</i>
<i>this is bullshit.</i>

17:28.915 --> 17:32.283
<i>Why am I drowning in this goo?</i>

17:32.285 --> 17:35.319
<i>And he saw this 15-foot high</i>

17:35.321 --> 17:36.988
<i>wave of molasses</i>

17:36.990 --> 17:40.558
<i>coming towards him and he's</i>
<i>like, holy shit, guys, run!</i>

17:40.560 --> 17:42.326
<i>Run run run run run run run.</i>

17:42.328 --> 17:45.696
<i>The force is so horrible.</i>

17:45.698 --> 17:48.399
<i>It takes this whole building</i>
<i>that they're in,</i>

17:48.401 --> 17:50.034
<i>pushes it off their foundation,</i>

17:50.036 --> 17:52.570
<i>and just carries this building</i>

17:52.572 --> 17:54.539
<i>and it almost goes</i>
<i>into the harbor.</i>

17:54.541 --> 17:59.043
They're pretty much trapped
with tons of debris

17:59.045 --> 18:00.645
<i>and they have molasses</i>

18:00.647 --> 18:03.714
just slowly rising up

18:03.716 --> 18:08.753
<i>and George Layhe is pinned down</i>
<i>underneath this pool table.</i>

18:08.755 --> 18:10.354
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

18:10.356 --> 18:11.489
- Yeah, see it?
- Okay.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.757
It's like chocolate.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.760
- Mmm.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.628
Mmmm!

18:17.630 --> 18:18.396

18:18.398 --> 18:20.998

18:25.872 --> 18:26.637
Stay tuned for more

18:37.749 --> 18:40.618

18:42.488 --> 18:43.688
- Oh.
Don't forget that.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.890
- [chuckles]

18:45.892 --> 18:47.458
Do you remember where you were?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.594
- We were talking about...

18:49.596 --> 18:50.795

19:25.165 --> 19:28.966
<i>John Barry's hair</i>

19:36.976 --> 19:40.511
<i>And of course they're</i>

<i>The harbor for six months</i>
