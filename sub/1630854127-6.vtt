00:35.201 --> 00:36.619
Oh, look at him!

00:37.829 --> 00:39.205
Look at him!

00:40.290 --> 00:42.792
-Good job!
-Good job.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.135
You did good!

00:52.218 --> 00:54.721
Oh, Shirley, he's perfect.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.264
Congratulations, guys.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.768
Oh God, Shirley.
He's just perfect.

00:59.851 --> 01:02.937
-Yes, Tony. You're so perfect.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.588
Ms. Hughes? Dr. Weeks will see you now.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.349
<i> I knew something was wrong.</i>

01:39.432 --> 01:42.393
Last couple of weeks
he hasn't been responding right.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.230
When Tony was treated for his pneumonia,

01:45.313 --> 01:48.358
it appears your ob-gyn
put him on a round of antibiotics.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.902
Yes, uh, ampicillin and…

01:52.028 --> 01:54.405
-Gentamicin.
-Gentamicin. That's right.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.783
The doctor said that was
the most effective way to treat it.

01:56.866 --> 02:00.787
In most cases, it is,
but sometimes there are side effects.

02:01.996 --> 02:05.667
Recent studies have shown gentamicin
to be potentially ototoxic.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.545
Um, harmful to a baby's hearing.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.880
So you think it might be an ear infection?

02:11.381 --> 02:13.508
Due to the round of antibiotics he was on,

02:13.591 --> 02:15.969
I believe your son
to have suffered a complete

02:16.052 --> 02:17.971
and most likely permanent hearing loss.

02:19.681 --> 02:25.270
Now, there are resources
for parents in your situation,

02:25.353 --> 02:26.855
but I won't lie to you.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.817
Your son is Deaf, Ms. Hughes.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.618
<i>Well, I guess</i>
<i>that's a better name than Will.</i>

07:32.702 --> 07:34.370
-Hey!

07:34.454 --> 07:36.789
Mm. Tony, how's the new job?

07:43.754 --> 07:48.342
Hey! If you getting a paycheck,
that's the dream.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.512
You don't need to be rich and famous.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.099
Just keep making me and the Lord proud.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.896
Hey, help me with these plates.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.147
Mm.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.121
Ooh.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.885
Front door.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.151
Stop discounting things.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.071
How may I help you?

11:45.663 --> 11:47.540
Hi, Tony. I'm Margaret, the manager.

11:57.258 --> 12:01.303
Hey, I'm real sorry, man, but we, uh,
we filled this position this morning.

12:03.055 --> 12:03.931
Uh…

12:09.437 --> 12:10.730
It's a record store.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.238
Sorry, we're no longer hiring.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.175
Welcome to The Bottom Half.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.930
Your receipt. I'll be right with you, sir.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.266
Thank you for shopping.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.019
-Mm-hmm. Thank you.
-Okay.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.729
How can I help you?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.907
All right, perfect.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.867
Yes, I love that. Love that.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.744
Love it. Great.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.496
Awesome. Sit down.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.292
Love that. Oh, yes.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.003
Good, lean forward.
Look at me. Look at me.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.465
Keep that look in your eyes.
Yes, serious. Serious.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.259
Amazing. Amazing.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.928
Excellent. All right. Now, get up for me.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.097
All right.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.723
What you say we try with the shirt off?

14:10.766 --> 14:13.185
I wouldn't have taken you for a shy guy.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.772
Oh, all right.

14:16.856 --> 14:17.773
Fantastic.

14:17.857 --> 14:18.941
Yeah. Amazing.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.943
Yes, just like that.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.362
All right. All right.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.322
Amazing.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.409
You're something else.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.497
You want a Coke?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.695
-Tony. Tony.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.865
No, you're not.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.826
Knew that city wouldn't treat you right.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.245
You need some meat on your bones.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.585
It's gonna happen for you, T. I know it.

16:02.252 --> 16:05.255
If he don't die of starvation first.

16:22.272 --> 16:25.401
I got my ultrasound back.
I'm having a girl.

16:31.699 --> 16:36.412
And, if I have your permission,
I want to name her after you. Tony.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.251
Can I buy you a drink?

18:09.463 --> 18:11.465
Uh, two whiskey Cokes, please.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.385
I like your dance moves.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.197
Are you Deaf?

19:10.107 --> 19:11.066
Tony.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.180
How do you dance so good?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.294
I need another drink. You want one?

20:13.587 --> 20:15.339
Oh, please? One more!

20:19.009 --> 20:19.927
Yeah!

20:20.427 --> 20:21.595
Stay right here.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.186
Two whiskey Cokes.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.271
Yeah. Hold that.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.569
Take a picture?

25:24.481 --> 25:28.610
And here are your jumbo orange sodas.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.072
That'll be 5.75.

27:45.705 --> 27:48.833
Hey, Dad. Shari. Come on in.

27:52.504 --> 27:56.841
This just needs to be warmed up.
Put that in the oven 350 for 20 minutes.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.177
Gotcha. Looks good.

28:01.179 --> 28:03.890
Uh, Dad, you want something to drink?

28:04.641 --> 28:07.394
-Uh, what're you having?
-A Coke.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.603
That sounds good.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.521
Shari?

28:09.604 --> 28:11.106
Water's just fine for me.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.190
Okay.

28:12.732 --> 28:13.942
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

28:14.818 --> 28:15.819
You look good, son.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.363
Thanks. You too.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.704
-You hire a housekeeper, hon?

28:26.204 --> 28:30.959
No, I figured I should take pride in
where I live, you know? Spruce it up.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.963
Take care of it.
Like you guys taught me to.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.464
-That's good, son.
-Thank you.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.216
You got some new friends here, I see.

28:38.299 --> 28:40.468
Oh, yeah. Yeah, they keep me busy.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.680
On my days off,
I find myself just sitting there,

28:44.222 --> 28:47.016
-watching 'em swim around for hours.
-Uh-huh.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.645
I really enjoy reading about

28:50.729 --> 28:54.357
how to keep the nitrate
and ammonia down to safe levels.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.777
Very good distraction.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.821
Oh, yeah. Pets… pets keep you honest.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.489
-Oh yeah.
-And out of trouble. Yeah.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.032
-Oh, for sure.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.075
Hm.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.374
-Hmm.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.426
You know…

29:21.509 --> 29:23.344
…I haven't been drinking much.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.846
-Oh.
-What, you quit?

29:24.929 --> 29:27.640
Well, quit drinking alone,
that's for sure.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.894
It wasn't doing me any good.

29:30.977 --> 29:33.688
And I don't drink
on weekdays anymore either.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.693
Don't get me wrong. I'll still have
a beer or two at a bar, but…

29:40.320 --> 29:41.196
that's about it.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.241
That's good, son. That's…

29:51.289 --> 29:52.248
Dad, I…

29:54.292 --> 29:55.668
I wanna thank you.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.798
For, uh…

30:01.508 --> 30:04.886
just sticking with me.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.849
I know I haven't always been easy.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.435
But, uh…

30:14.687 --> 30:17.440
I promise things
are turning around for me.

30:19.734 --> 30:22.195
I got a promotion at work.

30:22.278 --> 30:24.155
-Did you?
-A little more pay.

30:26.115 --> 30:27.408
New friend in my life.

30:27.492 --> 30:28.868
Oh, Jeff.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.039
Gosh.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.460
-I'm happy.
-Oh…

30:38.086 --> 30:40.046
-Oh, that's… that's…
-Hm.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.093
That's just… That's… that's good, son.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.346
-That's real good.
-Hm.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.598
Boy.

30:53.643 --> 30:56.688
You know, I don't…
I don't know how to tell you, um…

30:57.939 --> 30:59.649
how happy this makes me…

31:00.233 --> 31:01.359
um…

31:01.442 --> 31:03.820
to know my son is okay.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.739
Oh…

31:17.625 --> 31:18.543
A friend?

31:23.715 --> 31:24.924
A good friend.

34:20.516 --> 34:23.227
There's this
game I made when I was a kid.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.438
It's called Infinity Land.

34:35.615 --> 34:36.574
So

34:38.242 --> 34:40.369
your soldier starts at that end.

34:42.872 --> 34:46.125
My soldier starts from here.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.087
And each time you roll the dice…

34:50.338 --> 34:53.132
your soldier travels along the spirals.

34:54.634 --> 34:58.930
And the first person
to get to Infinity Land wins the game.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.891
But there's a catch.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.437
If your guy gets too close to mine…

35:11.025 --> 35:13.194
he disappears into the vortex.

35:19.575 --> 35:20.827
'Cause that's the game.

35:32.421 --> 35:33.673
You just can't!

35:50.523 --> 35:51.774
You go first.

37:04.972 --> 37:05.932
Okay.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.520
Don't go.

37:58.317 --> 37:59.193
Wha--

38:02.446 --> 38:04.031
When will I see you again?

38:07.785 --> 38:09.412
When will I see you again?

38:14.208 --> 38:15.543
How do I know that?

39:38.334 --> 39:42.338
Okay, what is your son's name again?

39:42.421 --> 39:44.298
Tony. Anthony Hughes.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.883
-Age?
-Thirty-one.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.843
-Last time you saw him?
-Two days ago.

39:49.762 --> 39:51.180
What makes you think he's missing?

39:51.263 --> 39:55.559
He was staying with me over the weekend,
but he didn't come home yesterday.

39:55.643 --> 39:59.355
He hasn't contacted me or his sisters,
which isn't like him.

39:59.438 --> 40:03.567
And I called his job in Madison,
and they said he didn't show up for work.

40:04.110 --> 40:07.571
-Do you know the last place he went?
-He said he was going to see a movie.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.532
-By himself?
-With a friend, I think.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.200
What's the friend's name?

40:12.451 --> 40:13.369
I didn't ask.

40:17.873 --> 40:19.125
Was it a lady friend?

40:19.208 --> 40:20.584
I don't think so.

40:21.210 --> 40:22.586
My son, he's…

40:24.588 --> 40:25.464
Deaf.

40:30.719 --> 40:33.889
Is it possible he left town
and just didn't tell you?

40:33.973 --> 40:37.601
Tony wouldn't do that.
He's a good boy, a good son.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.604
Life's always been hard for him.

40:41.522 --> 40:45.818
You can't imagine what it's like
going through the world not being able…

40:49.196 --> 40:51.490
But Tony never let it bring him down.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.577
That's who he is.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.165
He's always true to his word too.

41:01.167 --> 41:05.671
So if he said he's gonna come and see me
before he goes back to Madison,

41:05.754 --> 41:07.965
ain't no way he gonna break that promise.

41:11.969 --> 41:15.055
Any history of drug abuse
or gang violence?

41:16.140 --> 41:17.558
Anything you're leaving out?

41:22.313 --> 41:23.481
No.

41:25.441 --> 41:28.569
Like I said, he's a good boy.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.369
Okay.

42:26.919 --> 42:30.714
I just wanna thank you all

42:31.340 --> 42:34.552
so much for all your support.

42:36.053 --> 42:39.723
The cops aren't searching for Tony.

42:39.807 --> 42:44.144
So we have to take matters
into our own hands,

42:44.228 --> 42:49.733
and we're not gonna stop
until Tony is back home.

42:50.693 --> 42:51.735
Safe.

42:52.444 --> 42:56.365
Just keep praying for him.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.201
Please.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.413
Thank you.

44:07.061 --> 44:08.312
Argh!

44:13.108 --> 44:14.151
Fuck!

45:38.861 --> 45:39.820
<i>Hello.</i>

45:41.697 --> 45:43.449
<i>Hello, is someone there?</i>

45:45.951 --> 45:48.287
Is this the family of Errol Lindsey?

45:49.496 --> 45:51.498
<i>Yes. I'm his sister.</i>

45:51.582 --> 45:52.499
<i>Who's this?</i>

45:52.583 --> 45:54.752
You should stop looking for him.

45:56.295 --> 45:57.379
He's gone now.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.217
Into the vortex.

46:03.635 --> 46:07.139
<i>Into the… what? Who is this?</i>

46:08.640 --> 46:09.683
<i>Hello?</i>

46:11.518 --> 46:12.895
<i>Where's my brother?</i>

46:14.188 --> 46:15.564
<i>-Who the--</i>

48:06.800 --> 48:09.094
It's okay, Mama. We got it.
