WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:04.134
ISA, me and the wife,
we never really fit in.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.049
<i>Jordan was a good guy,
but the rest of 'em,</i>

00:06.049 --> 00:07.616
<i>I do not miss.</i>

00:07.616 --> 00:09.139
Howdy, neighbor.

00:09.139 --> 00:11.663
We have got to get
together for coffee!

00:11.663 --> 00:14.623
I love Blue Valley
and the people in it.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.233
You stopped Icicle.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.235
[screams] <i>
You got me justice.</i>

00:18.235 --> 00:20.281
That was an accident, pal.

00:20.281 --> 00:23.110
<i>Took off the limiter.
Now it works 24/7.</i>

00:23.110 --> 00:24.285
Rick, stop!

00:30.900 --> 00:32.728
Sofus!
He's having

00:32.728 --> 00:34.338
a heart attack.
What do we do?

00:34.338 --> 00:36.079
I'm still worried
about Cindy.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.254
What's that?

00:37.254 --> 00:38.168
It looks like a list

00:38.168 --> 00:39.952
of her father's laboratories.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.302
<i>Our lead.</i>

00:41.302 --> 00:43.304
If you wanna find Cindy,
let's find Cindy.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.003
Oh, boy.

00:54.489 --> 00:59.102
I'll kill
every last one of them.

it wouldn't have mattered

03:30.210 --> 03:33.909
if they were wearing dentures
or fitted with pacemakers.

03:33.909 --> 03:38.783
Anyone attacks us,
we take 'em out.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.916
Pat and his family
are our people now.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.658
I know.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.704
But we don't use violence
to solve our problems anymore.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.186
Yeah, well, we can't just let

03:50.186 --> 03:53.407
Grandma and Grandpa Icicle
walk away from this.

03:53.407 --> 03:58.281
We gotta do something.
- We will.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.327
What?

04:02.503 --> 04:05.201
I don't know yet.

04:49.593 --> 04:50.855
Oh, man.

04:50.855 --> 04:53.771
You gotta be kidding me, man.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.861
I never learn.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.994
Come on, man.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.517
<i>You asked for phone service.</i>

05:00.517 --> 05:02.780
<i>I came through
with flying colors.</i>

05:02.780 --> 05:05.174
Yeah, great job, Thunderbolt.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.262
<i>What?</i>

05:08.569 --> 05:10.788
<i>What's that?
"Thank you, Thunderbolt"?</i>

05:10.788 --> 05:13.313
<i>Oh, I didn't hear that.
That didn't get said.</i>

05:13.313 --> 05:17.360
<i>But you know what, Jakeem?
You're welcome.</i>

05:18.970 --> 05:21.886
It's working.
Wait, I can't tell.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.801
It sounds like a UFO. <i></i>

05:23.801 --> 05:24.933
<i>If you'd like to make
a call,</i>

05:24.933 --> 05:26.543
<i>please deposit ten cents.</i>

05:26.543 --> 05:29.198
Ten cents for a phone call?

05:29.198 --> 05:30.939
We need a dime.
Do you have a dime?

05:30.939 --> 05:32.506
Why would I need to walk
around with a dime?

05:34.899 --> 05:36.858
Just look.

05:37.902 --> 05:42.559
I have
some sour apple bubblegum.

05:42.559 --> 05:45.606
It's been in my pocket
for a while, though.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.876
Cindy Burman needs our help, huh?

05:54.876 --> 05:58.053
That backfired on us.
- What if that thing got her?

05:58.053 --> 06:00.229
It probably did!
She's probably in its belly,

06:00.229 --> 06:02.318
and we're gonna join her
down there.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.755
I mean, we would be home right
now if you had just been

06:04.755 --> 06:06.496
more specific
with the first wish.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.106
How was I supposed to know

06:08.106 --> 06:09.934
wishing to go home
wouldn't take us anywhere?

06:09.934 --> 06:12.850
<i>Because home is where
the heart is--</i>

06:12.850 --> 06:14.896
<i>a very apropos statement.
It actually came</i>

06:14.896 --> 06:18.160
<i>from one of my former masters,
Gaius Plinius Secundus.</i>

06:18.160 --> 06:19.901
<i>He and his best friend went
everywhere together</i>

06:19.901 --> 06:23.078
<i>like you and Mike,
even to an active volcano,</i>

06:23.078 --> 06:26.081
<i>the great Mt. Vesuvius,
which again, very apropos--</i>

06:26.081 --> 06:28.431
<i>caused their demise.</i>
- They died?

06:28.431 --> 06:31.478
<i>- Oh, but they died together.</i>
- Why is that ah-pro-pro?

06:31.478 --> 06:33.610
There'll be no death
for us today.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.960
Got that? <i>
- Yeah, why would there be?</i>

06:35.960 --> 06:39.137
<i>Unless that giant, mutated,
hungry, albino gorilla</i>

06:39.137 --> 06:42.227
<i>finds us, and then I'd have to
say, "Outlook not so good."</i>

06:44.099 --> 06:45.492
<i>Let's not die.</i>

06:45.492 --> 06:47.537
- <i>
- What?</i>

06:49.191 --> 06:51.628
<i>Oh, why couldn't that</i>

06:51.628 --> 06:54.370
<i>just be thunder?</i>
- Go, run, run!

06:57.068 --> 06:59.723
<i>Hello, you've reached
Michael P. Dugan, Esquire.</i>

06:59.723 --> 07:01.421
<i>Text me,
and I'll hit you back.</i>

07:01.421 --> 07:03.510
<i>I don't do phone calls.</i>

07:03.510 --> 07:06.208
Mike's still not answering.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.297
Jakeem either.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.646
So where are they?

07:09.646 --> 07:11.039
Well, Mike said he was gonna

07:11.039 --> 07:12.562
spend the night at Jakeem's.

07:12.562 --> 07:13.650
Jakeem told his mom he was

07:13.650 --> 07:14.869
spending the night here.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.305
Do you think the Mahkents

07:16.305 --> 07:17.567
did something to them?

07:17.567 --> 07:20.614
If they found out
that Mike killed Jordan--

07:20.614 --> 07:24.574
Pat, Mike and Jakeem lied
to us about where they were

07:24.574 --> 07:26.576
before everything with those

07:26.576 --> 07:28.578
Norwegian frosted freaks
went down.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.711
So the boys were
already off doing

07:30.711 --> 07:31.842
whatever they set out to do.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.975
We have to be sure
that the Mahkents

07:33.975 --> 07:36.673
are not involved.
- I agree.

07:36.673 --> 07:39.633
Beth tracked the receiving
signal from the spy cameras

07:39.633 --> 07:41.199
to the Mahkent house.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.853
They're the ones who've been
watching us.

07:42.853 --> 07:44.551
How could they not be involved?

07:44.551 --> 07:47.031
Because we've
been set up before.

07:47.031 --> 07:49.077
Think about it--
at the exact moment

07:49.077 --> 07:51.514
you and Cameron were trying to
bury past demons,

07:51.514 --> 07:53.603
Beth suddenly cracks

07:53.603 --> 07:56.214
into info that points the rest
of you at the Mahkent house

07:56.214 --> 07:59.522
like a gun,
so everything goes boom?

07:59.522 --> 08:01.959
I bet you one of my red boots
and one of Pat's puffer vests

08:01.959 --> 08:05.180
that the signal that Beth found
was a fabrication.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.617
Someone is trying
to distract us.

08:07.617 --> 08:10.620
Well, if the Mahkents haven't
been the ones watching us,

08:10.620 --> 08:12.535
then who's left?

08:19.194 --> 08:24.765
<i>Nurse Collins to 153 south.
Nurse Collins to 153 south.</i>

08:29.639 --> 08:33.904
This is not the way
of our family--

08:33.904 --> 08:38.039
waiting,
giving them time to plan,

08:38.039 --> 08:44.436
to attack us again?
Never.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.177
We don't know for sure
that that's what they're doing,

08:46.177 --> 08:48.702
Grandma.
And Papa, he said--

08:48.702 --> 08:51.487
Look at him, Cameron.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.968
Look at your grandfather.
- He might've died

08:53.968 --> 08:55.622
if Beth Chapel
hadn't called 911.

08:55.622 --> 08:59.626
They were the ones
who did this to him,

08:59.626 --> 09:02.237
just like your father.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.896
You know the truth now, Cameron,

09:08.896 --> 09:12.116
about Courtney Whitmore
and her friends--

09:12.116 --> 09:16.294
who they are, what they did.

09:17.208 --> 09:21.082
I'm going to take
your grandfather home.

09:21.082 --> 09:25.869
Go find the Whitmore girl.

09:25.869 --> 09:30.657
You know what
must be done next.

09:32.659 --> 09:35.226
I know.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.585
So what's the prognosis, Doc?

10:29.585 --> 10:31.892
Will I ever play violin again?

10:31.892 --> 10:35.460
That's not funny.
Mr. Mahkent almost died.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.375
Well, he didn't.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.899
Neither did I.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.857
That's true, but your
heart rate and blood pressure

10:40.857 --> 10:43.817
are elevated
to very unnatural levels.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.862
It's that hourglass, Rick.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.473
You've been wearing it
for too long.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.219
I feel better than ever,

10:55.219 --> 10:58.614
and with Cameron Mahkent
and his grandparents out there,

10:58.614 --> 11:00.660
none of us can let
our guard down right now.

11:00.660 --> 11:05.360
Rick, from what Beth told us,
you just rushed in.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.710
You even hit Courtney.
- It was an accident!

11:10.757 --> 11:12.933
Okay?

11:12.933 --> 11:15.675
You know that.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.241
We do,

11:17.241 --> 11:21.202
but you haven't been acting
like yourself, Rick.

11:21.202 --> 11:24.335
We're all really worried
about you.

11:28.339 --> 11:30.907
I'm fine.

11:30.907 --> 11:34.868
Really.
I am.

11:34.868 --> 11:37.218
Then take off your hourglass.

11:37.218 --> 11:40.351
Take it off for ten minutes.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.745
See how you feel.

11:48.664 --> 11:53.582
Don't ever tell me what to do.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.499
- Rick!
- Rick!

11:57.499 --> 11:59.153
Hold on!
- Rick!

12:24.178 --> 12:26.354
Not bringing the Staff?

12:26.354 --> 12:29.923
I gotta say it's a mistake.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.968
Yeah,
we're not here to fight.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.405
So we're here to die?

12:34.405 --> 12:36.407
Look, I'm sorry.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.800
I know
you're worried about Mike.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.934
- Yeah.
- But I'm worried about you.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.719
These people are evil people.

12:43.719 --> 12:47.027
They're the worst of the bunch.
You know they could kill us

12:47.027 --> 12:48.855
the second we step
on the front porch.

12:48.855 --> 12:52.989
If Mike's in there, I wanna
know about it right now.

12:52.989 --> 12:57.254
And if not, then we still got
a chance to calm the waters

12:57.254 --> 13:00.518
before any more blood
gets spilled, all right?

13:00.518 --> 13:02.825
We need to try.

13:02.825 --> 13:03.957
Okay.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.785
We're gonna die.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.658
One more thing--
no matter what they say,

13:09.658 --> 13:13.880
no matter what they do,
you follow my lead, all right?

13:13.880 --> 13:16.404
You check your temper...

13:16.404 --> 13:19.711
like Rick should've done.
- I got it.

13:26.718 --> 13:29.809
Feel all right?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.680
Come in.

13:51.395 --> 13:57.010
I'd offer you some tea,
but I'm in no shape to make it.

14:09.979 --> 14:14.723
Mr. Mahkent,
have you seen my son?

14:14.723 --> 14:16.116
No.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.639
Should we have?

14:20.598 --> 14:23.514
After everything
that's happened,

14:23.514 --> 14:28.911
have you done something to
my son and his friend, Jakeem?

14:31.174 --> 14:36.963
If I felt better,
I'd be angry at the allegation

14:36.963 --> 14:39.269
that I would hurt a child.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.228
You just tried to freeze-dry

14:41.228 --> 14:44.057
a bunch of kids,
Grandpa Frostbite.

14:46.624 --> 14:49.540
Oh, sorry.

14:49.540 --> 14:54.806
Well, yes.
We were defending ourselves,

14:54.806 --> 14:56.721
Starman.

15:02.075 --> 15:04.381
Where's your wife?

15:04.381 --> 15:08.385
She went out to pick up
some things for my recovery.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.822
We're glad you're doing okay.

15:16.959 --> 15:20.963
This should
never have happened.

15:20.963 --> 15:24.271
We brought our son
to this country to escape

15:24.271 --> 15:27.970
what we faced back home.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.973
You don't understand
what our family has endured

15:30.973 --> 15:33.236
over the centuries--

15:33.236 --> 15:36.196
hunted because
of what we can do.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.678
Fathers,

15:40.678 --> 15:43.029
mothers,

15:43.029 --> 15:46.032
children

15:46.032 --> 15:51.167
burnt like witches.

15:51.167 --> 15:56.477
Mr. Mahkent,
we don't wanna hurt you,

15:56.477 --> 15:57.869
all right?

16:00.176 --> 16:03.571
So let's put an end
to this feud.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.054
You killed our son.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.495
The why, the how--
that doesn't matter now.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.105
There's no coming back
from that,

16:16.105 --> 16:17.933
not for my wife.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.460
You should take your family
and friends far away

16:23.460 --> 16:28.857
from Blue Valley,
or you should come for us

16:28.857 --> 16:30.293
as others have before.

16:30.293 --> 16:33.470
We would love
to take a shot at you.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.170
Go now,

16:37.170 --> 16:41.130
before my wife returns and
kills you both where you sit.

16:43.828 --> 16:44.873
Go, please.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.559
<i>- Yeah, yeah, sure.</i>
- If you see Mike and Jakeem,

17:18.559 --> 17:21.127
can you just have them call me,
Mr. Bloomkiss?

17:21.127 --> 17:22.128
<i>No problem.
I got you.</i>

17:22.128 --> 17:25.087
Thank you.

17:45.629 --> 17:50.156
Your husband and his friend
came to our house today.

17:50.156 --> 17:53.246
So I came here.

17:53.246 --> 17:54.551
What do you want?

17:54.551 --> 17:56.466
To tell you that your family

17:56.466 --> 18:00.166
has hurt mine
too many times now.

18:01.819 --> 18:07.129
My son could have saved
this country's future,

18:07.129 --> 18:10.828
and he was so very fond of you.

18:13.744 --> 18:16.138
Oh.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.314
I won't miss
on purpose again.

18:23.493 --> 18:26.061
You have one second to leave.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.116
You need to learn
how to use this.

18:43.296 --> 18:46.037
Dude, dude!

18:46.037 --> 18:48.997
We gotta think of a wish.
Okay, this is good.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.520
Say this--

18:50.520 --> 18:53.393
"I wish that my friend,
Mike Dugan, and I were sitting

18:53.393 --> 18:56.352
"at a booth
at Richie's enjoying

18:56.352 --> 18:58.224
"strawberry milkshakes
and chocolate milkshakes,

18:58.224 --> 19:01.401
respectively,
at 212 Main Street."

19:01.401 --> 19:04.360
Wait, is it North or South
Main Street?

19:04.360 --> 19:06.667
<i>Gotta be specific, boys.</i>

19:10.497 --> 19:12.412
What happened?
Did we get eaten?

19:12.412 --> 19:14.327
<i>Ow, you're actually
on top of my--</i>

19:14.327 --> 19:16.329
What are you two idiots
doing here?

19:16.329 --> 19:18.505
<i>Hey, we found her!</i>

19:18.505 --> 19:21.899
Is that Cindy?
Oh.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.250
Hi.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.426
<i>Don't tell her
you have all of her stuff.</i>

19:28.036 --> 19:30.256
Ow.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.609
Ow.

19:35.609 --> 19:38.264
- Cindy, you're alive.
- What are you doing here?

19:38.264 --> 19:40.353
- We're looking for you.
- Why?

19:40.353 --> 19:42.006
We wanted to see
if you were okay.

19:42.006 --> 19:44.095
Yeah, now that you're
turning into a lizard.

19:44.095 --> 19:46.315
Lizards are, by far,
the most beautiful

19:46.315 --> 19:49.449
and intriguing members of the
reptile family, if you ask me.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.237
While we were
looking for you,

19:55.237 --> 19:59.241
we found
a giant, big, white gorilla.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.286
I'm not good at estimates,

20:00.286 --> 20:02.244
but I'd say, like,
30 feet tall.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.725
Yeah,
that's what that trap was for.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.944
<i>Huh.
You might need a bigger trap.</i>

20:06.944 --> 20:10.905
Look, down there,
you'll find a road, Etter Lane.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.820
It leads right back to town.
- Come with us.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.648
I can't.
I think that thing

20:14.648 --> 20:17.868
is one of my dad's
crazy science experiments.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.566
It's gotta be
what killed The Gambler, right?

20:19.566 --> 20:22.960
Probably.
So it's how I'll clear my name

20:22.960 --> 20:25.485
and shove it
into the smug faces

20:25.485 --> 20:27.487
of your sister's
dumbass friends.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.880
<i>- Admirable goals.</i>
- So do yourselves a favor.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.405
Go play some video games
and leave this to me.

20:32.405 --> 20:33.449
But The Thunderbolt
said that--

20:38.454 --> 20:39.760
<i>- What?</i>
- Yep, she--oh.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.328
<i>Oh, just like Batman!</i>

20:42.328 --> 20:44.678
She is out of her mind.

20:44.678 --> 20:45.940
<i>How 'bout those milkshakes,
guys?</i>

20:45.940 --> 20:48.682
<i>Do you wanna make that wish?</i>

20:58.257 --> 21:00.563
Whoa.

21:00.563 --> 21:03.131
<i>♪ My baby needs a--</i>

21:03.131 --> 21:04.915
It worked!

21:04.915 --> 21:06.439
<i>♪ Bubblegummer needs a--</i>

21:06.439 --> 21:08.310
Mm-hmm.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.878
- This is good.
- Mm.

21:10.878 --> 21:13.359
<i>Oh, my gosh, you know
what I totally forgot about?</i>

21:13.359 --> 21:15.361
<i>The gorilla.</i>
- Check, please.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.846
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

21:22.846 --> 21:24.979
You need
to stabilize your stance.

21:24.979 --> 21:28.591
- What does that mean?
- Move your legs.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.463
Don't lean forward.
- Okay.

21:30.463 --> 21:33.335
Keep your center of gravity
over your base.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.946
Keep your hands below the rail.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.384
If they're anywhere near these
cables, you'll lose a finger.

21:38.384 --> 21:41.865
Oh.
Oh, God.

21:41.865 --> 21:44.433
I don't know if I can do this.
I'm not a superhero.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.130
Not all superheroes

21:46.130 --> 21:48.611
fly through the air.
Some fire arrows.

21:48.611 --> 21:53.442
Come on.
- This is not me.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.139
Yes, it is.

21:55.139 --> 21:58.491
Courtney is a fighter.
She gets that from you.

22:00.841 --> 22:02.930
I don't wanna lose
the only real friend

22:02.930 --> 22:05.628
outside of my family
I've ever had.

22:05.628 --> 22:09.197
So now try again.

22:09.197 --> 22:12.505
But this time,
imagine Mrs. Mahkent's face

22:12.505 --> 22:15.246
on the target.
- Okay.

22:30.523 --> 22:34.440
- We'll keep practicing.
- Where'd it go?

22:34.440 --> 22:37.573
You fired it, right?

22:37.573 --> 22:39.401
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

22:41.838 --> 22:44.972
Lots of chances.
Got some arrows in the car.

23:10.824 --> 23:13.479
How is your grandfather?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.872
He's fine.

23:17.918 --> 23:22.139
Cameron, I am so sorry.

23:22.139 --> 23:24.403
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.057
Then why'd you do it?

23:27.057 --> 23:29.973
Yolanda and Rick were
just trying to protect me.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.671
They thought
your grandparents--

23:31.671 --> 23:35.370
My grandparents are not evil, okay?

23:37.459 --> 23:40.070
They're just angry.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.681
I'm angry.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.422
I know you are,

23:43.422 --> 23:46.468
and you have every right to be.

23:46.468 --> 23:49.645
You should've told me
the truth.

23:49.645 --> 23:52.953
I wanted to,
but I didn't know how.

23:52.953 --> 23:56.130
You just open your mouth,

23:56.130 --> 23:57.610
and you say it.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.394
Yes, but...

24:01.483 --> 24:03.137
I know how much
your father meant to you,

24:03.137 --> 24:08.055
and I didn't wanna change
the memory you had of him.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.535
Change it how?

24:11.450 --> 24:14.453
He did...

24:14.453 --> 24:16.455
bad things, Cameron.

24:18.674 --> 24:21.155
He killed people
to get what he wanted,

24:21.155 --> 24:25.899
and he was about to kill more,
so, so many more.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.424
I'm learning that he...

24:33.341 --> 24:37.563
I know he wasn't
a good guy all the time,

24:37.563 --> 24:41.523
but he was my dad, Courtney.

24:45.048 --> 24:46.093
Mine.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.403
Did you have to kill him
to stop him?

24:52.403 --> 24:56.277
Did you have to take him
away from me?

24:56.277 --> 24:57.670
Forever?

25:01.891 --> 25:06.548
We never set out to hurt him.
- Who did it?

25:06.548 --> 25:10.944
Who killed my father?

25:10.944 --> 25:14.643
It was an accident,
I swear to you.

25:14.643 --> 25:19.822
If it was an accident, then
someone needs to own up to it.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.829
Now, who?

25:26.829 --> 25:31.704
It doesn't matter who did it.

25:31.704 --> 25:34.750
It matters to me.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.582
Please.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.806
Please.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.815
I did it.

25:58.426 --> 26:00.515
I'm sorry.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.650
Cameron.

26:13.267 --> 26:16.705
I don't ever
wanna see you again.

26:51.740 --> 26:54.003
You sure you wanna do this?

26:54.003 --> 26:57.485
That old woman won't listen
to a word Barbara says.

26:57.485 --> 26:59.618
But we used to be
on their side of the fence--

26:59.618 --> 27:01.358
well, on Jordan's.

27:01.358 --> 27:05.493
They might be
more open-minded with us.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.823
Wow.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.783
Hope you have insurance.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.396
You know why we're here.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.660
Not exactly.

27:43.357 --> 27:48.841
- You were friends of our son.
- Can we sit down?

27:48.841 --> 27:51.974
All right, look,
I'm just gonna--

27:51.974 --> 27:55.717
I'm just gonna get right
to the--to the point.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.285
We're on behalf of Pat
and Barbara and the kids.

27:58.285 --> 28:02.419
So you've aligned yourself
with that horrible girl

28:02.419 --> 28:05.292
and her family?
- Despite our differences,

28:05.292 --> 28:06.728
I think all of us
in Blue Valley

28:06.728 --> 28:08.425
want the same thing.

28:11.733 --> 28:15.476
How could you presume
to know what we want?

28:16.999 --> 28:18.566
We need to reset.

28:18.566 --> 28:21.569
No more revenge plots,
no more violence,

28:21.569 --> 28:23.614
You want us
to forget everything?

28:23.614 --> 28:25.747
Not forget it,

28:25.747 --> 28:29.098
but learn from it.

28:29.098 --> 28:32.188
That's what Courtney Whitmore

28:32.188 --> 28:34.800
has been trying
to get us all to do--

28:34.800 --> 28:36.715
forgive one another.

28:36.715 --> 28:42.372
You want us to forgive the
people who murdered our son?

28:42.372 --> 28:43.504
Never!

28:57.518 --> 29:01.696
I'll hit the sky, see if
I can find any clue up there.

29:05.569 --> 29:07.006
Dad!

29:08.747 --> 29:10.531
Mike.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.968
Where ya been?

29:12.968 --> 29:14.404
- Dad, I--
- You okay?

29:14.404 --> 29:15.797
- I was--we were in the woods.
- Hey.

29:15.797 --> 29:16.842
I--

29:18.626 --> 29:20.236
That's--okay.
- You okay, Jakeem?

29:20.236 --> 29:21.934
You all right?
- You got a lot of folks

29:21.934 --> 29:23.674
worried, you know that?
- Yeah.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.024
Where were you?

29:25.024 --> 29:26.765
We found a monster
in the woods.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.419
- What?
- A monster?

29:29.419 --> 29:34.207
Grundy?
- It was a huge mutant gorilla.

29:34.207 --> 29:36.078
- Oh, God.
- Oh, boy.

29:36.078 --> 29:39.690
Yeah, a white one.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.519
- Pat...
- Yeah.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.130
A white gorilla.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.610
You know what it is?

29:48.264 --> 29:51.833
Unfortunately, yeah.

29:51.833 --> 29:55.184
Dad, what is it?

29:55.184 --> 29:57.230
It's one of
the most dangerous things

29:57.230 --> 29:59.798
that the JSA ever faced.

30:18.164 --> 30:21.645
Look, all of this, everything
that's been happening,

30:21.645 --> 30:23.822
it ain't about us.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.824
Jordan wanted
to build a new America

30:25.824 --> 30:29.740
because he believed he could
create a brighter, safer future

30:29.740 --> 30:30.959
for our children.

30:30.959 --> 30:34.441
That's why we got
on board with his plan.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.573
We believed in him.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.227
But if this continues,

30:38.227 --> 30:41.143
it will only bring more
destruction to our families

30:41.143 --> 30:42.884
and our community.
- And that's not

30:42.884 --> 30:44.233
what Jordan wanted in the end.

30:44.233 --> 30:46.975
- No, it wasn't.
- So you kill them,

30:46.975 --> 30:49.891
then they kill you, and a lot
of other people get killed

30:49.891 --> 30:52.285
along the way.
Believe me.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.287
My wife and I, we've been
doing this a long time.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.289
We know.

30:56.289 --> 30:58.378
That's how this goes.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.902
How will this help Cameron?

31:00.902 --> 31:04.210
What kind of future
will this give him

31:04.210 --> 31:08.040
and his children?

31:08.040 --> 31:11.434
Jordan wanted
the best for his kid.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.482
So do what's right.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.011
Give it up

31:23.011 --> 31:26.101
like we did.

32:06.837 --> 32:10.145
Hey, Court.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.364
I'm okay.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.412
No Rick?

32:16.412 --> 32:18.023
I haven't heard back yet.

32:18.023 --> 32:22.027
Kay, well, that kid, he needs
to get his head on straight,

32:22.027 --> 32:24.377
'cause the man
that Mike and Jakeem found,

32:24.377 --> 32:26.945
he's the worst threat
that you can imagine.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.511
Yeah, but he's not a man, Dad.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.209
He used to be.

32:30.209 --> 32:34.778
When the Justice Society first
formed, there was a scientist--

32:34.778 --> 32:36.693
didn't know his real identity.

32:36.693 --> 32:41.002
He just went
by "The Ultra-Humanite."

32:41.002 --> 32:43.048
But he went by a lot of names.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.441
When we first met him,
he was just another criminal

32:45.441 --> 32:49.576
until he escaped us by putting
his brain

32:49.576 --> 32:52.753
into the body of an actress
named Dolores Winters.

32:52.753 --> 32:56.104
I mean, that sounds like
a science fiction horror movie,

32:56.104 --> 32:58.063
but it's exactly what happened.

32:58.063 --> 33:02.197
Dolores Winters,
the famous actress?

33:02.197 --> 33:05.896
He put his brain in her body?

33:05.896 --> 33:08.029
- H-how'd he do that?
- Magic?

33:08.029 --> 33:11.119
Surgery with a little help
from Dragon King.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.034
We don't even know
if the scientist body

33:13.034 --> 33:16.037
we first met him in
was his original one.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.561
Anyway, he assumed
Dolores Winters' identity

33:18.561 --> 33:20.259
and fooled everyone.

33:20.259 --> 33:23.044
Dolores Winters
went on to win an Oscar.

33:23.044 --> 33:27.788
For "Remembering to Forget."
It's one of my mom's favorites.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.137
The Ultra-Humanite had been

33:29.137 --> 33:32.706
in Dolores' skull
for over a year by then.

33:32.706 --> 33:35.535
So he won the award?

33:35.535 --> 33:37.058
Exactly.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.234
When the JSA found out
the truth about Winters,

33:39.234 --> 33:42.977
The Ultra-Humanite sought out
a body strong enough

33:42.977 --> 33:46.111
to destroy us.
So he and Dragon King

33:46.111 --> 33:49.244
stitched
that mutated ape together

33:49.244 --> 33:53.031
and put his brain in that.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.728
He has to be the one
that sucker-punched me

33:54.728 --> 33:57.165
back at The Gambler's trailer.

33:57.165 --> 33:59.254
That's probably also
who killed The Gambler, right?

33:59.254 --> 34:00.081
- Mm-hmm.
- So was he the one

34:00.081 --> 34:01.865
that was watching us?

34:01.865 --> 34:03.998
That would be his M.O.

34:03.998 --> 34:05.913
But what does he want?

34:05.913 --> 34:08.916
Besides revenge
against the JSA?

34:08.916 --> 34:10.309
It's anyone's guess.

34:19.622 --> 34:20.884
What do you think?

34:20.884 --> 34:23.496
I think
they're considering it.

34:23.496 --> 34:25.585
Let's hope so.

35:26.472 --> 35:30.171
The Ultra-Humanite
is the next Eclipso.

35:30.171 --> 35:32.956
What does that mean?

35:32.956 --> 35:38.701
He's the next real evil that
has to be stopped by all of us.

35:38.701 --> 35:40.616
Pat, that's what
I was talking about when I said

35:40.616 --> 35:42.227
we had to come together--

35:42.227 --> 35:46.579
the Crocks, Cindy, and now

35:46.579 --> 35:48.711
the Mahkents.

35:49.843 --> 35:52.367
If this villain
is as powerful as you say,

35:52.367 --> 35:55.370
it'll take everyone
to stop him,

35:55.370 --> 35:57.285
including the Mahkents.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.765
I know you wanna help
Cameron, but--

35:58.765 --> 36:01.898
This isn't just about
helping Cameron, Yolanda.

36:01.898 --> 36:03.900
It's about all of us.

36:03.900 --> 36:08.949
Good and bad have come together
before, and we can do it again,

36:08.949 --> 36:11.691
and get another new start.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.432
Maybe she's right.

36:13.432 --> 36:16.565
It's gonna take each
and every one of us, though,

36:16.565 --> 36:19.046
working together.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.210
Huh!

36:52.210 --> 36:53.428
- Oh.
- Whew.

36:53.428 --> 36:55.865
That's better.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.043
- Oh.
- Ah.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.175
It's Artie. <i></i>

37:01.175 --> 37:02.307
Hey!
- Oh, hi!

37:02.307 --> 37:04.961
<i>- Dad, Mom, I got in!</i>
- What?

37:04.961 --> 37:06.354
<i>Mr. Morrison was at tryouts,</i>

37:06.354 --> 37:08.574
<i>and oh, my God,
I'm going to Nebraska!</i>

37:11.141 --> 37:13.274
- Congratulations!
- Oh, my God, our kid

37:13.274 --> 37:16.277
is the first female quarterback
in college football!

37:16.277 --> 37:18.148
Yeah,
we knew you could do it!

37:18.148 --> 37:19.149
Hey, look,
we're on our way home.

37:19.149 --> 37:20.281
We're gonna see you soon.

37:20.281 --> 37:21.282
We are gonna celebrate tonight!

37:21.282 --> 37:23.023
Mwah!
- We love you so much.

37:23.023 --> 37:24.416
- We love you! <i>
- Love you too!</i>

37:24.416 --> 37:27.332
So proud of you.
Hey, see you soon.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.118
- Ah!
- Oh, I knew it!

37:32.206 --> 37:34.513
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Oh!

37:34.513 --> 37:36.819
Everything's coming up
Crock today.

37:38.517 --> 37:41.607
This is fantastic.
Oh, my God.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.739
It's really--

37:55.577 --> 37:57.753
The hell?

38:01.931 --> 38:03.629
What the hell is this?

38:12.855 --> 38:16.032
Someone wants our attention.

38:16.032 --> 38:17.469
If they're
looking for trouble,

38:17.469 --> 38:22.343
they're gonna be sorry
they got it.

39:28.931 --> 39:31.891
What is this?

39:34.284 --> 39:38.288
What the hell?

39:40.160 --> 39:41.770
Oh!

39:41.770 --> 39:43.946
No!

40:12.627 --> 40:15.848
At least you'll die together.

40:35.345 --> 40:42.178
I...love... you.

40:42.178 --> 40:45.834
I love you too.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.505
Greg, move your head.
