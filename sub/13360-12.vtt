00:52.481 --> 00:53.710
What are you doing here?

00:53.744 --> 00:55.777
You already know the answer
to that question.

00:55.810 --> 00:57.977
The time has come for
you to kill Pasiphae.

00:58.010 --> 01:01.484
Bring me evidence of my
sister's death by midday,
three days hence.

01:01.517 --> 01:03.150
And if I refuse?

01:04.250 --> 01:07.217
Need I remind you that
you swore an oath?

01:07.250 --> 01:10.984
If you fail, it will not only
be your life I take.

01:13.517 --> 01:14.550
Wait!

02:03.657 --> 02:05.090
(GASPING)

03:21.530 --> 03:25.697
That will not come out.
We're going to have
to get a new table.

03:25.730 --> 03:29.264
Perhaps we'll have to trek
to Circe's cave and demand
that she pays for it.

03:29.297 --> 03:31.430
I'm just saying.
I'm very fond of this table,

03:31.464 --> 03:33.230
it has sentimental value.

03:33.264 --> 03:34.397
You stole it.

03:34.430 --> 03:37.630
Oh,
very funny story, actually.
It belonged to Alcaeus.

03:37.664 --> 03:42.930
Now, he is more fond
of sheep than any man
I have ever met.

03:44.830 --> 03:46.130
Another time?

03:49.264 --> 03:50.364
What will you do?

03:51.730 --> 03:53.430
There is
nothing else I can do.

03:54.830 --> 03:57.697
I have to kill Pasiphae.

03:57.730 --> 03:59.604
There must be
a way out of this.

03:59.637 --> 04:01.070
What if we were
to flee the city?

04:01.104 --> 04:05.704
No. No matter how far we went,
Circe would find us.

04:05.737 --> 04:07.404
Her magic's too powerful.

04:08.837 --> 04:12.770
I made a promise.
The time has come
to honour it.

04:13.570 --> 04:15.070
And if I don't...

04:16.737 --> 04:18.070
Then we'll all be dead.

04:24.537 --> 04:29.370
As much as I hate to admit it,
this is all my fault,
isn't it?

04:32.803 --> 04:36.237
I will not let
you face this alone.

04:36.270 --> 04:38.870
And there's no way you're
sitting this one out.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.837
I had no intention
of sitting it out.

04:40.870 --> 04:44.437
Good, so all we need to do
is break into the palace,
get past all the guards,

04:44.470 --> 04:48.537
kill the Queen
and then sneak back
out without getting caught.

04:48.570 --> 04:51.270
How... How hard can it be?

04:57.204 --> 04:59.610
MINOS: My time
is drawing near.

05:00.444 --> 05:02.644
There will be dark days ahead.

05:04.110 --> 05:07.810
Our enemies will seek
to exploit my passing.

05:09.077 --> 05:13.810
You must stand united,
or Atlantis will fall.

05:15.644 --> 05:17.877
Swear to me...

05:17.910 --> 05:22.044
That you will protect
and care for each other.

05:23.310 --> 05:24.910
That is my only wish.

05:24.944 --> 05:28.277
Of course. You have my word.

05:30.210 --> 05:31.744
I will do as you ask.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.977
You must get some rest.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.810
I will return later.

05:50.144 --> 05:51.544
(DOOR CLOSES)

05:55.544 --> 05:58.077
After I pass,

05:58.110 --> 06:02.617
there will be
no one to protect
and care for Ariadne.

06:02.650 --> 06:05.117
Do not fear for Ariadne.

06:05.150 --> 06:09.484
I will care for her
as if she were
my own daughter.

06:10.350 --> 06:11.550
Mmm.

06:16.484 --> 06:19.584
I take comfort
in your strength.

06:19.617 --> 06:23.084
Now, enough talk
of your passing.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.350
(GRUNTS)

06:24.384 --> 06:26.284
You will soon be better.

06:28.117 --> 06:29.817
There, enough.

06:29.850 --> 06:31.317
Where are
the Queen's chambers?

06:31.350 --> 06:33.850
According to my calculations,
the inner courtyard is here,

06:33.884 --> 06:37.150
which would put
the royal chambers
somewhere here, to the west.

06:37.184 --> 06:39.650
Where have you been?
You've been gone for hours.

06:39.684 --> 06:42.184
I was negotiating with Idas,
the wine merchant.

06:42.217 --> 06:43.950
Oh, does that
explain why you're drunk?

06:43.984 --> 06:47.984
I was negotiating,
and then I was celebrating.

06:48.617 --> 06:49.917
So, he'll do as we ask?

06:49.950 --> 06:52.850
It's all taken care of.
He'll get us into the palace.

06:52.884 --> 06:54.850
You must strike when the
Queen is most vulnerable.

06:54.884 --> 06:57.084
The latrine. Get her
while she's on the latrine.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.557
Her dress is
around her ankles.
You sneak up on her...

07:02.324 --> 07:05.690
I'm not going to kill
the Queen of Atlantis while
she's on the latrine.

07:05.724 --> 07:07.824
I was going to suggest killing
her while she slept.

07:07.857 --> 07:09.257
Suit yourself.
(SNIFFS)

07:09.290 --> 07:11.290
-Ooh! Is that you?
-No!

07:11.324 --> 07:12.824
And you call me an animal.

07:12.857 --> 07:16.290
It's seaweed.
I found a way to knock out
the palace guards.

07:16.324 --> 07:18.724
Fishermen, when cooking
seaweed to eat, discovered

07:18.757 --> 07:21.057
that the fumes can act
as a powerful sedative.

07:21.090 --> 07:24.124
It's been known to render
entire crews unconscious.

07:24.157 --> 07:26.924
The trick is to calculate
the exact concentration.

07:26.957 --> 07:30.324
Too weak and it won't work,
too strong and it
could kill a man.

07:30.357 --> 07:31.557
We should test it first.

07:31.590 --> 07:33.957
And you're confident
of your calculations?

07:33.990 --> 07:36.490
Well, completely.
I think we can all agree
that I am not an idiot.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.524
Then you should be
the first to test it.

07:38.557 --> 07:40.190
(STRUGGLING)

07:53.857 --> 07:56.724
When he wakes up,
we'll tell him
he's not an idiot.

08:21.393 --> 08:26.260
I know the Queen is evil,
and no one more
deserves to die, but...

08:26.293 --> 08:29.960
Do you really believe
that you can take her life
in cold blood?

08:32.327 --> 08:37.093
If I don't do it,
then Circe will kill us all.

08:37.127 --> 08:39.627
Well, then, at least you'll
die with a clear conscience.

08:39.660 --> 08:42.227
I would die knowing
that I'd failed
to do everything

08:42.260 --> 08:44.527
I could to save my friends.

08:44.560 --> 08:47.393
And that is unthinkable.

09:20.933 --> 09:23.033
PASIPHAE:
Minos has accepted his fate.

09:23.067 --> 09:25.467
It is only a matter of days
until he passes.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.867
Surely that's a good thing?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.800
Indeed it would be,
had you succeeded in winning

09:28.833 --> 09:30.333
Ariadne's hand in marriage.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.300
I did all that I could.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.867
And yet still you failed.

09:35.467 --> 09:39.500
When the King dies,
the throne shall
pass to Ariadne.

09:39.533 --> 09:41.400
We must find a way
to neutralise her.

09:41.433 --> 09:42.800
You wish for me
to have her killed?

09:42.833 --> 09:45.133
If I am to retain the support
of the people and the court,

09:45.167 --> 09:48.733
we shall have to be a little
more subtle than that.

09:50.100 --> 09:53.800
Sometimes I
struggle to believe
I had such high hopes for you.

10:18.207 --> 10:20.173

10:32.173 --> 10:34.007

10:54.173 --> 10:55.807
Hercules,
you take the one on the left.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.607
I'll take
the one on the right.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.307
Pythagoras, you take
the one in the middle.

factor body weight
into my calculations.

11:39.113 --> 11:40.747
It's very interesting how...

11:40.780 --> 11:43.013
Shut up and tell us
where we're going.

11:43.047 --> 11:44.213
The roof. Trust me.

11:50.647 --> 11:53.113
The royal chambers
are directly below us,

11:53.147 --> 11:54.680
or at least I think they are.

11:54.713 --> 11:57.280
Now, suddenly,
you're not so sure?

11:57.313 --> 11:59.980
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

12:03.353 --> 12:06.053
Good luck.
We'll be watching
for your return.

12:10.520 --> 12:11.953
Now, are you sure
you can hold me?

12:11.987 --> 12:14.787
I'll have you know,
I once tossed a rabid bull
off a cliff.

12:14.820 --> 12:17.220
How is that even
remotely relevant?

12:17.253 --> 12:18.687
I can hold you.

If Jason has been caught,
they wouldn't be
ringing the bells.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.473
Maybe they've discovered
the Queen is dead.

15:13.507 --> 15:16.007
Then we're saved.
Circe will spare us.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.040
That will be of little comfort
when we are caught
and executed for treason.

We cannot leave him.

We agreed that if the alarm
was raised it was
every man for himself.

Do you still
want to stay here?

Jason will have no way out.
He'll be trapped.

they will hang us with that

was an assassin.

19:32.097 --> 19:33.531
I couldn't do it.

I have often thought
of killing her myself,
for all that she has done.

a dagger deep into her heart.

To take a life in cold blood
is not an easy thing.

Pasiphae would not think twice

We are not the same as her.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.971
Surely that's a good thing?

20:13.671 --> 20:15.537
I should attempt
to escape from the palace.

20:15.571 --> 20:16.971
It's madness.

20:17.004 --> 20:18.837
The exits are sealed.
You will get caught.

20:18.871 --> 20:21.937
If I am found
in your chambers,
they will execute us both.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.837
I will not risk your life
by staying here.

20:23.871 --> 20:25.771
I will gladly risk
my life for you...

20:27.571 --> 20:30.004
As you have for me.

20:30.037 --> 20:31.971
I will not hear
of you leaving.

20:33.137 --> 20:35.437
We must wait until dawn.

20:35.471 --> 20:37.804
They will assume
the intruder has escaped,

20:37.837 --> 20:39.537
and then I will
smuggle you out.

20:43.837 --> 20:45.971
You must spend the night here.

20:47.504 --> 20:49.304
If you really insist.

20:50.637 --> 20:51.704
I do.

20:58.304 --> 20:59.337
Jason?

21:01.737 --> 21:02.977
Jason?

21:06.644 --> 21:09.577
This is a disaster.
I'm starting to fear he may
have been caught.

21:09.611 --> 21:12.577
What did I say?
I said he should
have got her on the latrine.

21:12.611 --> 21:14.611
You are never more vulnerable
than when you're...

21:14.644 --> 21:15.644
It was madness.

21:15.677 --> 21:17.644
We were fools to let Jason
go through with it.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.144
And you think we could
have stopped him?

21:20.177 --> 21:23.777
The boy is more headstrong
than anyone I've ever met.

21:23.811 --> 21:25.544
There's nothing we can do

21:25.577 --> 21:28.244
but sit and wait and pray
for his safe return.

21:29.511 --> 21:30.511
(SIGHS)

21:31.577 --> 21:33.277
We could have some wine.

22:05.684 --> 22:07.417
How long have you been awake?

22:09.551 --> 22:10.851
A while.

22:14.017 --> 22:15.584
What are you thinking?

22:18.984 --> 22:20.217
Nothing.

22:24.751 --> 22:26.551
You should put
some clothes on.

22:34.651 --> 22:37.384
What is it? What's wrong?

22:39.384 --> 22:40.517
Let me.

22:44.084 --> 22:48.851
I know there are many
privileges that come from
being the King's daughter,

22:48.884 --> 22:53.884
but sometimes I wish I had
been born the daughter
of a smith or a carpenter.

22:56.151 --> 22:58.284
I'd lead a normal life.

22:58.317 --> 23:01.384
I'd be free to
meet a simple boy
of my own choosing.

23:02.484 --> 23:04.691
Are you calling me simple?

23:04.724 --> 23:06.591
I didn't mean stupid.
I meant...

23:07.257 --> 23:08.757
(LAUGHS)

23:08.791 --> 23:10.591
I believe you
know what I meant.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.224
I've already said too much.

23:16.391 --> 23:17.957
I like listening to you.

23:21.591 --> 23:26.191
I enjoyed last night more
than any other since
I arrived in Atlantis.

23:26.224 --> 23:30.124
You are wounded.
Every guard in the palace
is searching for you,

23:30.157 --> 23:32.957
and we will both
be executed as traitors
if you are found here.

23:34.224 --> 23:35.224
And yet...

23:37.224 --> 23:39.457
When I am with you,
all seems right
with the world.

23:46.424 --> 23:47.824
You must go.

Ione will arrive
soon and I will not
be able to hide you from her.

23:50.991 --> 23:52.591
How do I get
out of the palace?

23:52.624 --> 23:54.091
There is a way.

24:20.564 --> 24:22.631
The passage
leads to the temple.

24:22.664 --> 24:24.464
I can't thank you enough.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.997
I only wish I knew
when I would see you again.

24:27.031 --> 24:29.631
I don't know what will
happen in the days to come.

24:29.664 --> 24:30.864
If my father passes, I...

24:30.897 --> 24:34.297
I won't let any harm
come to you. I promise.

24:42.764 --> 24:43.931
(MEN SHOUTING)

24:44.864 --> 24:46.131
You must go.

24:52.297 --> 24:54.897
RAMOS: The palace has been
searched. There is no sign
of the intruder.

24:54.931 --> 24:56.531
We must assume
he escaped during the night.

24:56.564 --> 24:58.897
How is that possible
when every exit was sealed?

24:58.931 --> 25:01.097
I am at a loss to explain it.

25:01.131 --> 25:03.904
Am I to believe
that an assassin
can make an attempt on my life

25:03.937 --> 25:05.237
and then escape undetected?

25:05.271 --> 25:07.804
I have doubled the guard
and increased the patrols.

25:07.837 --> 25:10.437
I will assign a squad
of my best men
to protect you personally.

25:10.471 --> 25:13.804
No, no.
Search the palace again,
every room, every corner.

25:13.837 --> 25:16.137
Question every servant,
every courtier.

25:16.171 --> 25:18.271
There must be some trace
of the intruder.

25:18.304 --> 25:19.471
It will be done.

25:20.804 --> 25:23.271
You have served the King
loyally for many years,

25:24.937 --> 25:27.871

of thinking you can fail me.

I couldn't kill Pasiphae.

I held her life
in my hands and...
I couldn't take it.

26:06.674 --> 26:10.207
I failed you, and now
Circe will kill us all.

26:11.207 --> 26:12.774
You couldn't just...

26:15.607 --> 26:17.007
JASON: I'm sorry.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.007
I suppose it's not
entirely your fault.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.574
No, because it
is mostly yours.

26:20.607 --> 26:22.340
You have to keep bringing
that up, don't you?

26:22.374 --> 26:24.674
Even I'm allowed
to make some mistakes.

You've yet to have an idea.

26:40.107 --> 26:41.840
What about the beards?
That was mine.

26:41.874 --> 26:45.774
Fleeing the city
and growing beards
is your answer to everything.

26:45.807 --> 26:49.140
I still think it could work.
Grow a big bushy beard.

26:49.174 --> 26:51.507
-Maybe dye it ginger.
-(SCOFFS)

26:51.540 --> 26:53.140
It's better than
sitting around here

waiting for Circe
to slaughter us in our beds.

26:55.707 --> 26:58.407
JASON: We have until tomorrow
before we must face Circe.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.640
I need some rest.
I got no sleep.

Oh, Princess Ariadne
keep you awake, did she?

27:05.814 --> 27:07.514
It's always the quiet ones.

27:07.547 --> 27:10.247
Did I tell you
about the carpenter's
daughter, Asphasia?

-Yes.
-Yes. Many, many times.

Why don't we all

27:15.380 --> 27:17.614
We'll need our strength
when we face Circe.

27:24.047 --> 27:25.880
I checked with the guard
and the door was locked.

27:25.914 --> 27:28.080
So, we have found
the intruder's escape route.

Only members
of the royal family
possess keys to the door.

Why did you let me
drink so much wine?

28:38.887 --> 28:40.787
I didn't. It was Jason.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.287
He sedated us.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.987
Ugh. Why would he do that?
Does he know I've
been taking his money?

28:46.020 --> 28:47.654
It's not stealing,
it's borrowing.

28:47.687 --> 28:50.854
It's because he means
to face Circe alone.
And she's going to kill him.

28:50.887 --> 28:53.520
That boy has been
nothing but trouble

28:53.554 --> 28:55.387
since he arrived in Atlantis.

28:55.420 --> 28:57.754

-I know.
-We have to do something.

get killed together.

I fear he grows weaker
with each day that passes.

I know how hard it is for you,
watching him fade.

29:53.794 --> 29:56.127
I remember when
my own father died.

29:57.694 --> 29:59.260
I loved him deeply.

30:01.294 --> 30:03.294
I was inconsolable.
I cried for days.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.600
I find that hard to believe.

30:05.634 --> 30:06.900
It is nonetheless true.

30:06.934 --> 30:09.167
I was not so different
from you when I was young.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.667

how cruel the world can be,

30:12.700 --> 30:14.734

the days to come.

30:16.700 --> 30:18.534

Of course.

escaped the palace.

30:36.667 --> 30:38.234
And how was that?

30:40.234 --> 30:44.300
It appears he fled
through the passageway,
into the temple.

30:46.767 --> 30:48.734
You don't seem surprised.

30:49.834 --> 30:51.800
I am neither
surprised nor otherwise.

mentioned the existence
of the passageway to anyone,

30:55.467 --> 30:56.967
even in passing?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.834

to believe it was
a closely guarded secret.

38:55.462 --> 38:59.696
Right, I have bread, cheese,
olives and wine.

38:59.729 --> 39:02.796
-Jason...
-Don't worry.
I didn't forget your pies.

39:02.829 --> 39:04.329
There's lots of pies.

39:07.336 --> 39:08.536
What is it?

39:11.969 --> 39:14.836
Ariadne has been arrested.

39:14.869 --> 39:16.969
She is to stand
trial for treason.

39:17.436 --> 39:19.236
Why?

39:19.269 --> 39:21.002
She's accused of
harbouring the assassin

39:21.036 --> 39:23.036
that tried to kill the Queen.

39:25.402 --> 39:28.202
Did Ariadne say
whose blood it was?

39:28.236 --> 39:30.069
IONE: She told me it was the
blood of the intruder

39:30.102 --> 39:32.069
who had attempted to kill you.

39:32.102 --> 39:35.369
Princess Ariadne confessed she
harboured him in her chambers.

39:38.069 --> 39:40.136
Do you deny this is the truth?

39:41.636 --> 39:42.836
No.

39:54.602 --> 39:56.336
Then you must understand

39:56.369 --> 40:00.002
that this is a violation of
Poseidon's most sacred laws.

40:00.036 --> 40:02.002
We have no choice
but to find you guilty.

40:02.036 --> 40:03.969
You do not have the authority.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.169
My father won't
stand for this.
I demand to see him.

40:06.202 --> 40:09.276
Sadly, the King
has not been conscious
for the last two days.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.776
The only comfort
I get from this is knowing

40:12.809 --> 40:15.909
he will never learn
of his daughter's betrayal.

40:15.942 --> 40:17.442
I would never betray him!

40:17.476 --> 40:21.009
I am loyal to the King
and the people of Atlantis.

40:21.042 --> 40:23.009
The Queen has always
coveted the throne.

40:23.042 --> 40:24.742
It is she who conspires
against the King.

40:24.776 --> 40:26.276
You have confessed
to your crimes,

40:26.309 --> 40:28.976
and yet now you seek
to divert attention from them.

40:29.009 --> 40:31.576
Perhaps, if you were to reveal
the identity of the intruder,

40:31.609 --> 40:34.176
you could be shown
a degree of mercy.

40:34.209 --> 40:36.976
I do not believe
you capable of mercy.

40:37.642 --> 40:38.809
You refuse to name him?

40:38.842 --> 40:40.676
-I did not ask his name.
-(LAUGHS)

40:40.709 --> 40:43.976
You expect the court
to believe that you harboured
a complete stranger?

40:44.009 --> 40:46.476
I would help anyone
who would see you dead.

40:49.176 --> 40:51.009
Then you have
sealed your fate.

40:52.642 --> 40:54.876
You shall be
sentenced to death.

40:55.909 --> 40:58.142
When the moon
is at its height,

40:58.176 --> 41:00.909
you will be taken
to the brazen bull.

41:00.942 --> 41:02.109
(GASPS)

41:03.942 --> 41:05.942
No. Anything but that.

41:06.942 --> 41:09.182
(CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

41:11.249 --> 41:12.349
Please!

41:12.382 --> 41:14.382
(CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

41:14.416 --> 41:15.549
I beg you!

41:15.582 --> 41:19.716
(CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

41:19.749 --> 41:21.716
Why do you just stand there?

41:24.616 --> 41:26.282
Take her to the cells.

41:45.749 --> 41:46.916
(DOOR OPENS)

41:48.182 --> 41:49.349
Tell me.

41:51.116 --> 41:54.749
Ariadne has been
sentenced to death.

41:54.782 --> 41:58.182
She is to be executed
tomorrow, when the moon
is at its height.

42:14.389 --> 42:17.089
JASON: <i>Ariadne is ready</i>
<i>to give up her life</i>
<i>to protect me.</i>

42:18.122 --> 42:20.989
I will rescue her
or die trying.

42:21.922 --> 42:22.922
(GRUNTING)

42:29.789 --> 42:32.556
ORACLE: Who better to protect
him than his own father?
