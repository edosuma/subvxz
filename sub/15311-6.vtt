00:00.856 --> 00:02.346
<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

00:02.352 --> 00:04.785
Agent Carlisle? Stan Hoffman.
Secret Service.

00:04.793 --> 00:07.594
Agent Hoffman is leading an
Inter-Agency Task Force.

00:07.635 --> 00:08.852
Any leads?

00:08.858 --> 00:11.952
We have a witness who saw Nix talking
to a man at the tavern that night...

00:12.028 --> 00:14.261
We got a problem.
Any way to get in front of this?

00:14.263 --> 00:16.564
No. Security is too tight.

00:16.566 --> 00:17.698
Did you find out who he is?

00:17.700 --> 00:20.601
His name is Carlisle.
He's an FBI agent.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.002
What?

00:22.004 --> 00:23.536
I told you not to test me.

00:23.538 --> 00:24.604
Where's Brian?

00:24.606 --> 00:26.772
- Keep going. Just keep...
- Oh!

00:27.841 --> 00:30.076
Clear.

00:30.078 --> 00:32.415
We have a pulse.
Keep applying pressure.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.809
Pull over a floor lamp,
I'm gonna hang an IV bag.

00:35.717 --> 00:37.083
- Keep your hands where I can see 'em!
- What's going on?

00:37.085 --> 00:38.884
You have the right to remain silent.

00:38.886 --> 00:41.020
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

00:41.022 --> 00:42.955
We found your guy.
Thanks for the tip.

00:42.957 --> 00:45.190
You think because you're beautiful
that you're special.

00:45.192 --> 00:46.692
Don't you, Sandrine?

00:46.694 --> 00:47.860
I'll get you your money.

00:48.930 --> 00:51.130
I want fifty thousand dollars
by tomorrow.

00:51.132 --> 00:52.732
I'm not gonna negotiate.

00:52.734 --> 00:54.233
Please don't do this.

00:54.235 --> 00:55.667
Bury her Ellen.

00:55.669 --> 00:58.103
You can torture me
as much as you want.

00:58.105 --> 00:59.237
It doesn't matter.

00:59.239 --> 01:00.805
'Cause my kids got away.

01:00.807 --> 01:01.806
I win.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.678
I win.

01:21.660 --> 01:26.596
I think it's time we accept this situation

01:26.598 --> 01:28.865
and do what they say.

01:28.867 --> 01:31.267
Trying to escape was a mistake and

01:31.269 --> 01:33.569
it almost got your father killed. So...

01:33.571 --> 01:36.973
From now on, we cooperate.
Understand?

01:42.345 --> 01:44.046
How do you know
they're not just going to kill us

01:44.048 --> 01:45.213
when this is all over?

01:45.215 --> 01:46.948
Because I trust them.

01:46.950 --> 01:49.350
Your mother understands
what needs to be done.

01:49.352 --> 01:51.952
Just do what she says
and you'll all be fine.

01:52.288 --> 01:53.822
You have my word.

02:02.230 --> 02:03.998
What the hell was that?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.901
- Did he put you up to it?
- No.

02:06.903 --> 02:09.870
It's something I needed to say.
Out loud.

02:09.872 --> 02:11.839
In front of him.

02:11.841 --> 02:13.707
Even if I don't believe it.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.745
Where's Archer?

02:18.747 --> 02:19.879
He's busy.

02:19.881 --> 02:21.447
That's not what I asked.

02:21.882 --> 02:23.616
He'll be back soon.

02:23.618 --> 02:25.585
He's working on something.
Out of the area.

02:25.587 --> 02:27.586
As for your compensation...

02:28.589 --> 02:30.190
I'm trying to get the money together,

02:30.192 --> 02:32.991
- but it might take me a few days.
- I don't have a few days.

02:32.993 --> 02:36.963
I need 50 Gs. Cash. Today.

02:37.130 --> 02:38.763
Or I'm out.

02:50.242 --> 02:52.650
I take it you were just discussing
her money problems?

02:52.656 --> 02:54.062
We're good.

02:54.179 --> 02:55.980
So you paid her?

02:55.982 --> 02:57.581
Not yet. But I will.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.218
She's going to walk. I'm telling you.
We can't afford that right now.

03:00.220 --> 03:03.520
She's in too deep.
She knows the consequences.

03:03.522 --> 03:06.356
- Maybe I can help.
- I said I'll take care of it.

03:24.241 --> 03:26.041
Here you go.

03:27.210 --> 03:28.610
Thank you.

03:35.285 --> 03:38.447
Okay... What time?

03:39.589 --> 03:42.111
Great. I'll see you then.

03:46.729 --> 03:48.593
Don't move!

03:49.165 --> 03:51.132
Stop! She's my sister!

03:51.134 --> 03:53.133
There is, uh, no need for a gun.

03:53.135 --> 03:56.387
Uh, please put it down.

03:59.374 --> 04:01.927
It's okay, Lauren.
There's nothing to worry about.

04:01.931 --> 04:05.145
- He's just...here to protect me.
- From what?

04:05.147 --> 04:07.080
I'm the President's surgeon.

04:07.082 --> 04:10.517
He's here to make sure
that I'm safe.

04:10.519 --> 04:13.119
Until the day of the operation.

04:13.121 --> 04:15.755
You know you're supposed
to inform me of all visitors, Dr. Sanders.

04:15.757 --> 04:17.190
Well she didn't know I was coming.

04:17.192 --> 04:19.591
No, it's true. I had no idea.

04:19.594 --> 04:22.094
My apologies, ma'am.
Agent McKay.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.630
Secret Service.

04:23.632 --> 04:25.263
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.933
Yeah, I think so.
Just wasn't expecting to have a gun

04:27.935 --> 04:30.569
pointed at my face
so early in the morning.

04:30.571 --> 04:34.573
I know, it's crazy.
We're supposed to clear all visitors.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.274
- Sounds annoying.
- Yeah.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.911
Well, it's definitely
been a big adjustment.

04:40.980 --> 04:44.248
I'm so thrilled you stopped by.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.251
But now is really not
a good time to visit.

04:47.253 --> 04:49.620
As you can see,
there's a lot going on.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.923
I just figured it was the weekend,
you guys would be around...

04:52.925 --> 04:55.760
Plus, I haven't seen
the kids in so long.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.060
Right.

04:57.062 --> 04:58.995
James and I broke up.

05:00.268 --> 05:01.644
He's already kicked me out.

05:01.681 --> 05:04.395
So I just need a place
to stay for a few days.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.920
- Uh...
- Please?

05:08.405 --> 05:09.973
- Have you called Mom?
- Seriously?

05:09.975 --> 05:11.065
Yeah, I'm sorry.

05:11.141 --> 05:12.906
It's just a few days.
I'll stay in the guest room.

05:12.941 --> 05:15.544
No, we're remodeling.
And it's just a total mess.

05:15.546 --> 05:17.246
Okay, fine. The den.

05:17.248 --> 05:18.247
That's not...

05:20.049 --> 05:22.251
- Get rid of her.
- I can't, she's...

05:22.253 --> 05:25.153
Complicated. Yeah.
I know about your sister and her issues.

05:25.155 --> 05:27.556
Which is why she needs to go.
Soon.

05:27.558 --> 05:29.157
Okay, I get it.

05:29.159 --> 05:32.293
But I can't just kick her to the curb,
she'd get suspicious.

05:32.295 --> 05:34.763
- It's not something I would do.
- Take care of this.

05:34.765 --> 05:37.362
Otherwise, I will.

05:48.276 --> 05:50.744
- Who's the visitor?
- Ellen's sister.

05:50.746 --> 05:53.079
She thinks we're the Sanders'
security detail.

05:54.348 --> 05:55.616
Is she staying?

05:57.118 --> 05:58.519
No.

05:58.521 --> 06:00.353
Then why is she making up a bed?

06:07.494 --> 06:10.262
Until she's gone, make her think
you're Secret Service too.

06:15.335 --> 06:19.003
I took the pregnancy test on
the day they took us hostage.

06:20.540 --> 06:23.041
Have you talked to your boyfriend?

06:23.043 --> 06:25.176
The father?

06:25.178 --> 06:27.211
They forced me
to break up with him.

06:27.213 --> 06:29.147
Oh. We love you.

06:29.149 --> 06:31.716
And we're going to help you
get through this.

06:31.718 --> 06:34.184
Okay, first thing we're going
to do is take you to a doctor

06:34.186 --> 06:36.520
and get the pregnancy
test confirmed.

06:36.522 --> 06:40.724
But right now, like it or not,
we have to go say hi to Lauren.

06:40.726 --> 06:43.360
Act like everything is normal.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.062
Right. Normal.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.668
You get everything you need
for your biology project?

06:51.670 --> 06:53.436
I'm fine. I promise.

06:56.106 --> 07:00.142
Are oxygenated and non-oxygenated
blood the same color?

07:00.144 --> 07:02.011
That's what textbooks are for.

07:06.683 --> 07:09.417
I, uh...
I have to go out for a bit.

07:09.419 --> 07:11.152
Where?

07:11.154 --> 07:12.354
The hospital.

07:13.990 --> 07:15.123
Be back soon.

07:16.425 --> 07:18.594
I'm gonna need 50 grand.

07:18.596 --> 07:20.228
Today?

07:20.230 --> 07:23.130
Without the cash, I'm going
to lose one of my operators.

07:23.132 --> 07:25.265
You need to talk to our
friend in the White House.

07:25.267 --> 07:28.102
- I'm talking to you.
- Yeah, well...

07:28.104 --> 07:30.237
I take my orders from someone else.

07:33.575 --> 07:35.510
Hoffman.

07:35.512 --> 07:37.311
He wants us in the office.

07:48.523 --> 07:50.490
- Agent Carlisle.
- Hey.

07:50.492 --> 07:53.059
- Got any new leads?
- No. Not yet.

07:53.061 --> 07:55.594
There's still lots of video
to look over.

07:55.596 --> 07:57.496
Hopefully we can find
some footage of the man

07:57.498 --> 07:59.598
Angela was with
the night she disappeared.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.667
Duncan. Take care of these.

08:03.036 --> 08:04.603
Good to see you, Stan.

08:04.605 --> 08:06.104
Even if it is a beautiful
Saturday morning.

08:06.106 --> 08:08.140
No such thing as a weekend
around here.

08:08.142 --> 08:10.009
Not when the President's life
is at stake.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.743
I'd like you to sit in
on an interview.

08:11.745 --> 08:14.212
Just hang back and observe.
I need a second opinion.

08:14.214 --> 08:15.213
Of course.

08:23.556 --> 08:26.657
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice, Dr. Sanders.

08:52.715 --> 08:57.350
Dr. Ellen Sanders, I'd like you to meet
Special Agent Carlisle with the FBI.

08:57.352 --> 08:58.985
He's been helping us
with our investigation

08:58.987 --> 09:00.653
into the disappearance
of your friend, Angela.

09:04.291 --> 09:05.491
Pleasure to meet you.

09:07.626 --> 09:09.428
So you working on this together?

09:09.430 --> 09:10.795
The Secret Service and the FBI?

09:10.797 --> 09:12.030
Correct.

09:12.032 --> 09:14.599
How does that work?
I mean, do you volunteer,

09:14.601 --> 09:17.035
or did they ask for your help?

09:17.037 --> 09:20.738
Agent Carlisle is highly regarded
within the Bureau.

09:20.740 --> 09:22.040
We're thrilled to have him
on board.

09:24.742 --> 09:27.511
I'd like to ask you
a few questions, Doctor.

09:27.513 --> 09:30.681
The night Angela disappeared,
you said that she was worried

09:30.683 --> 09:34.418
that she'd done irreparable damage
to her nursing career?

09:34.420 --> 09:36.220
Correct.

09:36.222 --> 09:39.689
But you never mentioned that you
talked to a man at the Windham Tavern,

09:39.691 --> 09:42.459
a man who saw her leave
with another person?

09:43.760 --> 09:45.395
To be more specific,

09:45.397 --> 09:47.330
he told you that
she had just left with

09:47.332 --> 09:49.670
"a tall black man, about 35."

09:50.501 --> 09:52.702
I didn't tell you that?
I thought I had.

09:52.704 --> 09:54.033
I apologize.

09:54.039 --> 09:55.380
Your good friend goes missing

09:55.386 --> 09:57.958
and you forget to bring up
a detail like that?

09:58.941 --> 10:00.542
What were you doing
at the bar that night?

10:02.578 --> 10:05.981
I was trying to comfort my friend.

10:05.983 --> 10:09.951
She needed someone to talk to
and I said I would meet her for a drink.

10:09.953 --> 10:11.952
But she was gone
when you got there?

10:11.954 --> 10:14.088
- Yeah.
- And that didn't bother you?

10:14.090 --> 10:17.358
That she just disappeared?
No text? No heads up?

10:17.360 --> 10:19.160
What did you think had happened?

10:19.162 --> 10:23.464
I guess I figured she was under a lot
of pressure, met an attractive man...

10:23.466 --> 10:26.567
She's a grown woman.
I didn't think much of it.

10:26.569 --> 10:29.403
Fair enough.
But why didn't you tell Agent Hoffman

10:29.405 --> 10:32.672
about your conversation
with this man at the bar?

10:32.674 --> 10:33.940
Well, um...

10:33.942 --> 10:36.743
I'm not a detective.

10:36.745 --> 10:40.113
My mind...
It doesn't automatically jump to

10:41.349 --> 10:43.082
tragic conclusions.

10:43.084 --> 10:46.752
Not to mention, I was under a
fair amount of stress myself.

10:46.754 --> 10:51.023
Press conferences,
interrogations, lie detectors.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.493
And then my friend kills herself, so...

10:54.495 --> 10:56.529
If I forgot to mention

10:56.531 --> 11:01.899
a brief conversation with a drunken
idiot at a bar, I'm sorry.

11:04.836 --> 11:06.436
Thank you, Dr. Sanders.

11:17.348 --> 11:19.383
I thought you were going
to hang back and observe.

11:19.385 --> 11:22.352
Just trying to help, I didn't
mean to step on your toes.

11:22.354 --> 11:24.921
So what do you think?
She telling the truth?

11:24.923 --> 11:27.324
I'd need to spend more
time with her, of course,

11:27.326 --> 11:30.060
but my gut tells me
she's credible.

11:48.544 --> 11:49.979
Agent Carlisle.

11:49.981 --> 11:51.379
This changes nothing.

11:51.381 --> 11:52.848
Pretty convenient.

11:52.850 --> 11:54.850
Getting assigned
to investigate Angela's case.

11:54.852 --> 11:57.486
It's in both of our best interests.

11:57.488 --> 12:00.122
Remember, Ellen.
I'm on your side.

12:00.124 --> 12:02.758
Then why were you grilling me
back there?

12:02.760 --> 12:06.127
To get you the hell out of the room
so he couldn't grill you.

12:06.129 --> 12:08.730
When I get back,
I want your crazy sister gone.

12:19.674 --> 12:22.042
So, based on the date
of your last period

12:22.044 --> 12:26.146
and average cycle length,
you're five weeks, two days along.

12:27.615 --> 12:31.084
I was hoping you were gonna
say that I made a mistake,

12:31.086 --> 12:32.719
or that I did it wrong.

12:35.523 --> 12:37.823
Have you thought about
what you'd like to do?

12:40.060 --> 12:42.094
Not really.

12:42.096 --> 12:44.930
Have you discussed it
with the baby's father?

12:44.932 --> 12:48.167
No. And we're not together.

12:56.408 --> 12:58.376
What happened here?

12:58.378 --> 12:59.878
Uh, cheerleading.

13:11.823 --> 13:14.391
And the laceration on your back?

13:15.894 --> 13:16.860
Cheerleading as well?

13:19.698 --> 13:21.565
The bathtub faucet.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.834
I was shaving my legs,
I sat up...

13:56.431 --> 13:59.033
Yes, this is Dr. Dana Marsh calling.

13:59.035 --> 14:02.836
I'd like to report a possible case
of abuse involving a minor patient.

14:03.872 --> 14:07.441
Last name is Sanders.
Morgan Sanders.

14:08.910 --> 14:11.878
You have to be strong.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.614
I'll come visit real soon.

14:14.616 --> 14:17.983
It's just that I'm...
I'm busy working right now.

14:19.486 --> 14:21.520
But you know I love you
more than anything.

14:35.502 --> 14:36.623
Yeah?

14:36.627 --> 14:39.833
Why is it that people
who owe money never call?

14:39.874 --> 14:43.508
But people who need money
always seem to find my number.

14:43.510 --> 14:45.877
I told you. I would have it
by the end of the day.

14:45.879 --> 14:48.679
How 'bout I be a gentleman
and come to you for the handoff?

14:48.681 --> 14:50.848
Save you some gas money?

14:50.850 --> 14:53.050
I'm in Annapolis,
at my brother's house.

14:53.052 --> 14:54.786
It's a long drive from the city.

14:54.788 --> 14:58.122
I know exactly where you are,
and it's nowhere near Annapolis.

14:58.124 --> 14:59.990
You don't have my money
by eight o'clock tonight,

15:01.358 --> 15:02.826
I'll be knocking at the door.

15:07.564 --> 15:09.666
Hey, where are you going?

15:09.668 --> 15:10.934
I got a meeting.

15:10.936 --> 15:13.369
You're taking off.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.871
You're a genius.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.006
You can't go.

15:17.008 --> 15:18.307
We need you.

15:18.309 --> 15:19.975
We're barely holding this
thing together as it is.

15:19.977 --> 15:21.476
It's not my problem.

15:22.879 --> 15:25.445
How badly do you need this money?

15:25.916 --> 15:27.582
I think I might have a solution.

15:29.452 --> 15:31.086
It's not exactly legal...

15:31.088 --> 15:33.859
And it would take
both of us to pull it off.

15:35.057 --> 15:36.391
What are you talking about?

15:38.428 --> 15:40.661
I know about a private poker game.

15:40.663 --> 15:45.466
Rich guys who like hookers and scotch
and carry too much cash.

15:45.468 --> 15:49.369
My old girlfriend was a dealer.
Card dealer.

15:50.339 --> 15:52.640
They like to hire pretty girls
for atmosphere.

15:54.609 --> 15:56.710
If you can hack into her e-mail,

15:56.712 --> 15:58.578
you'll get all the information.

16:01.315 --> 16:02.816
There it is. Hold up.

16:02.818 --> 16:03.817
Open that.

16:05.686 --> 16:07.654
Now, send Liz
an email from the agency

16:07.656 --> 16:09.489
telling her the gig's been canceled.

16:11.325 --> 16:13.859
Are you sure this is an easy score?

16:13.861 --> 16:15.661
We're talking about a bunch
of rich, round-ass guys

16:15.663 --> 16:17.496
cheating on their wives,
playing poker...

16:17.498 --> 16:19.465
It sounds like a pretty
soft target to me.

16:20.967 --> 16:23.569
You're just going to need a dress.

16:23.571 --> 16:26.104
What?

16:26.106 --> 16:30.007
You got to look hot or they'll call
the agency and ask for a new girl.

16:30.009 --> 16:31.676
Ah, I wouldn't worry about that.

16:32.778 --> 16:33.878
I'm not.

16:38.049 --> 16:40.585
So how is it that you owe
this guy so much money?

16:40.587 --> 16:41.919
How'd you get involved?

16:43.454 --> 16:45.489
I needed money for legal fees.

16:45.491 --> 16:47.924
I tried to move some drugs.

16:47.926 --> 16:48.925
Didn't work.

16:50.060 --> 16:51.661
Then why'd you need the lawyers?

16:55.433 --> 16:56.733
I have a son.

17:07.242 --> 17:08.544
Lauren?

17:09.945 --> 17:11.714
They're upstairs in Jake's room.

17:15.851 --> 17:17.452
You okay, baby?

17:21.457 --> 17:23.590
Did Dr. Marsh confirm
that you're pregnant?

17:33.568 --> 17:35.836
You're not, like, mad at me?

17:37.872 --> 17:39.339
No.

17:43.778 --> 17:45.345
Thanks, Mom.

17:54.421 --> 17:55.988
That's good.

17:59.525 --> 18:01.793
Hey. How was work?

18:01.795 --> 18:05.330
Fine.
You know, just another meeting.

18:05.332 --> 18:08.299
Hey, do you know who's on duty?

18:08.301 --> 18:10.335
Um, it's Agent...

18:11.370 --> 18:13.505
The woman.

18:13.507 --> 18:15.306
And the tall guy, Kramer.

18:15.308 --> 18:19.310
I don't understand why you guys
need protection in your own house.

18:19.312 --> 18:21.378
She's the President's surgeon.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.246
All sorts of things could happen.

18:23.248 --> 18:25.816
- Like what?
- Like...

18:25.818 --> 18:28.385
She could be held
hostage or something.

18:28.387 --> 18:30.554
Come on. Your mom is
not that important.

18:30.556 --> 18:32.189
Yeah, she's right.

18:32.191 --> 18:35.292
I'm just another doctor
and he's just another patient.

18:38.362 --> 18:40.897
How was, um, Baltimore?

18:43.767 --> 18:46.102
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

18:46.104 --> 18:48.270
No, no it's okay. Um...

18:48.272 --> 18:49.438
It was very helpful.

18:52.542 --> 18:53.909
Thanks for asking.

18:55.378 --> 18:57.979
Jake...
Come with me, please.

19:07.323 --> 19:08.756
Where are you taking him?

19:08.758 --> 19:10.958
We'll be back soon.
Nothing to worry about.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.226
What does that mean?

19:12.228 --> 19:13.561
We need to go somewhere.

19:13.563 --> 19:15.462
Which means there's nobody here
to keep an eye on you.

19:15.464 --> 19:17.999
Jake is our insurance policy.

19:18.001 --> 19:19.000
Let's go.

19:41.288 --> 19:43.856
Whose house is she going into?

19:43.858 --> 19:45.525
And why is she dressed like that?

19:45.527 --> 19:47.360
You ask too many questions, kid.

19:48.362 --> 19:50.329
Wait, where are we going?

19:50.331 --> 19:51.831
See what I mean.

19:56.971 --> 19:59.371
- Yeah?
- Hi. I'm Andie, your dealer.

19:59.373 --> 20:02.441
- Code?
- Hoya Saxa. Whatever that means.

20:03.976 --> 20:05.243
Come on in.

20:12.785 --> 20:14.351
Nice place.

20:14.353 --> 20:15.852
Thanks.

20:16.822 --> 20:18.823
Want something to drink?

20:18.825 --> 20:20.058
Water, please.

20:34.088 --> 20:36.029
You're safe, okay?

20:40.645 --> 20:42.847
You have nothing to worry about.

20:47.485 --> 20:49.085
You like music?

20:49.087 --> 20:50.686
Yeah. Sure.

21:10.072 --> 21:11.473
- Oh.
- Lauren.

21:11.475 --> 21:12.674
Sorry.

21:12.676 --> 21:15.477
Whoa. That looks nasty.
What is that?

21:15.479 --> 21:17.111
Uh, it's just a...

21:17.113 --> 21:20.648
I had a cyst removed
from my kidney, and, um...

21:20.650 --> 21:23.451
the incision got infected,
so they had to excise some skin and...

21:23.453 --> 21:25.119
Ugh, that sounds gross.

21:26.355 --> 21:29.690
That didn't hurt
as much as you think.

21:32.127 --> 21:33.560
Can I have a minute, please?

21:33.562 --> 21:37.063
Uh, sure. I was just looking
for Ellen's face cream...

21:37.065 --> 21:38.131
Ah.

21:38.133 --> 21:40.233
Ah.

21:40.235 --> 21:42.402
You guys have something
you want to tell me?

21:42.404 --> 21:45.504
Yes. Your husband has
a hole in his stomach.

21:47.675 --> 21:49.275
I'm not going to use it all.

21:52.245 --> 21:54.012
What did you tell her?

21:54.014 --> 21:57.082
I just made something up.
But I can't do this dance much longer.

21:57.084 --> 21:58.417
Where the hell
did they take Jake?

21:58.419 --> 22:00.819
I don't know, she just said
they had to go somewhere.

22:03.256 --> 22:06.724
So, what happened with Hoffman
at the hospital?

22:06.726 --> 22:11.062
Yeah. Well, I can't even believe
I'm saying this.

22:11.064 --> 22:14.332
- What are you talking about?
- He was there. With Hoffman.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.534
Duncan.
They're partners or something.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.202
Duncan?

22:19.405 --> 22:21.605
What? He's investigating
a murder he committed?

22:21.607 --> 22:24.208
I know. It's...
He has connections everywhere.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.112
There's just no way out of this.

22:30.215 --> 22:31.481
Unless...

22:32.684 --> 22:34.084
Unless what?

22:37.554 --> 22:38.754
We kill him.

22:49.295 --> 22:51.594
It's not easy
to kill someone like that.

22:51.596 --> 22:53.130
We need a gun.

22:53.132 --> 22:56.266
Yeah, I, uh...
I've been thinking about that.

23:00.203 --> 23:01.837
The Hunts, next door.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.473
He's always trying to get you
to go to the shooting range.

23:04.475 --> 23:06.309
Brags about sleeping with his gun.

23:06.311 --> 23:09.578
So, you just want me to go over there
and ask, "Hey, can I borrow your pistol?"

23:09.580 --> 23:11.447
We have their spare house key.

23:17.786 --> 23:21.222
Duncan.
I've got some good news.

23:21.224 --> 23:23.158
The screen grab
from a surveillance camera.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.661
Less than a block away from
where Angela disappeared from.

23:26.663 --> 23:29.697
Looks like the mystery man
she left the bar with.

23:29.699 --> 23:32.300
I think we finally found our guy.

23:32.302 --> 23:33.734
Terrific.

23:33.736 --> 23:35.770
Come on, I want
to show you something.

23:42.544 --> 23:47.181
Time stamp 6:32 PM.
One block from the Windham Tavern.

23:47.183 --> 23:49.483
He was headed toward a bar.

23:49.485 --> 23:51.518
Any footage of them
leaving together?

23:51.520 --> 23:53.241
No, sir. But they could have
gone out the back.

23:53.279 --> 23:54.904
There's no cameras there.

23:54.939 --> 23:58.391
So, right now, all we have is a picture
of a man walking down the street.

23:58.393 --> 24:01.102
Well, we need to ID him,
and we need to talk to him.

24:01.109 --> 24:04.131
- Any other angles?
- No, this is the best shot we have.

24:04.199 --> 24:07.466
Okay, so, listen, send it through facial
recognition right away, all right?

24:07.468 --> 24:08.567
Yes, sir.

24:18.545 --> 24:20.039
Now, I'm a creative chef,

24:20.118 --> 24:22.900
but how am I supposed
to make dinner out of nothing?

24:22.935 --> 24:25.425
We've been doing a lot of takeout.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.787
Where are your knives?

24:29.789 --> 24:32.256
I'm not sure.

24:32.258 --> 24:35.259
- What?
- Well, they're being sharpened.

24:35.261 --> 24:37.561
I've been watching
this cooking show,

24:37.563 --> 24:41.231
and the chef keeps talking about how
critical it is to have sharp knives.

24:41.233 --> 24:43.234
Oh. That's the dumbest lie
I've ever heard.

24:43.239 --> 24:45.309
Seriously. Where are they?

24:45.344 --> 24:46.902
Um...

24:49.407 --> 24:53.375
The Secret Service took them.
Safety measure.

24:53.377 --> 24:58.313
So, wait, so, you mean to tell me
that, with all the weapons they have,

24:58.315 --> 25:00.550
there concerned that
someone's gonna bust in here

25:00.552 --> 25:04.586
and hack up the entire family
with a steak knife?

25:05.622 --> 25:08.323
God, I don't make up the rules.

25:08.325 --> 25:14.095
Well, you ask me, this President thing?
Real pain in the ass.

25:23.706 --> 25:25.039
Emily?

25:26.507 --> 25:27.708
Patrick?

26:18.189 --> 26:21.191
Our facial recognition results.

26:21.193 --> 26:25.429
Dean Ruggs, DMV employee from Cincinnati.
He claims he never set foot in DC.

26:25.431 --> 26:27.665
Archer Petit.
Born in Brooklyn. Age 36.

26:27.667 --> 26:30.233
- Ex-military. No priors.
- Where does he live now?

26:30.235 --> 26:32.951
Can't find a current address,
but a search of FAA records

26:32.989 --> 26:35.347
turned up a passenger manifest
from Thai Airways

26:35.385 --> 26:38.030
that says he was out of the country
on the night in question.

26:38.065 --> 26:39.643
Okay, an alibi.
And our third guy?

26:39.645 --> 26:42.145
Paul Jameson.
Serious rap sheet.

26:42.147 --> 26:46.048
- Lives right here in DC.
- Sounds like he's our man.

26:46.050 --> 26:47.815
Let's get on it.

26:58.962 --> 27:01.628
- What time does the game start?
- Any minute.

27:03.398 --> 27:06.467
Do I have time to run back to my car?
I forgot my phone.

27:06.469 --> 27:08.535
Sure.

27:08.537 --> 27:11.005
Should I buzz in
or is there a code I can use?

27:12.740 --> 27:16.377
I just thought the code
might be useful for later.

27:21.515 --> 27:23.918
2332.

27:49.408 --> 27:50.941
Yeah.

27:50.943 --> 27:53.644
One guy packing,
back of the room, next to the bar.

27:53.646 --> 27:56.614
Code is 2332.
Guy in charge is Charlie.

27:56.616 --> 27:58.649
- Got it.
- See you in 15.

27:59.651 --> 28:01.652
- Good luck.
- You too.

28:12.796 --> 28:15.832
Thai Airways, huh?
You don't miss a trick.

28:17.502 --> 28:20.870
Excuse me, Agent Logan.
I'd like a moment with Agent Carlisle.

28:24.841 --> 28:26.842
Why didn't you speak up
about Archer Petit?

28:28.011 --> 28:29.912
Speak up about what?

28:29.914 --> 28:34.116
I searched his files manually
in case we missed something.

28:34.118 --> 28:36.752
I found out you two have
worked together in the past.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.754
We have.

28:39.756 --> 28:41.756
Something else you want to say?

28:41.758 --> 28:44.359
Because his alibi doesn't hold water.

28:44.361 --> 28:46.127
There's a record of him
traveling to Bangkok,

28:46.129 --> 28:48.463
but his passport never
cleared Customs.

28:48.465 --> 28:50.765
You have any idea how
that could have happened?

28:50.767 --> 28:52.633
Yes.

28:52.635 --> 28:54.701
I made it up.

28:54.703 --> 28:58.372
I needed to backstop him,
so I falsified his travel records.

28:58.374 --> 29:01.041
- What the hell are you talking about?
- He's working for me.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.842
As a confidential informant.

29:03.911 --> 29:05.612
Why didn't you say anything?

29:05.614 --> 29:08.848
I assume you've never worked
undercover, Agent Hoffman?

29:08.850 --> 29:12.885
You don't out a source in a room
full of people you don't know. Ever.

29:12.887 --> 29:15.955
Even when you're investigating a
possible assassination attempt?

29:15.957 --> 29:20.359
You're Secret Service,
I'm FBI. We think differently.

29:20.361 --> 29:22.061
In what way?

29:22.063 --> 29:25.630
My informant's life is just as valuable
to me as the President's is to you.

29:25.632 --> 29:27.332
You could've come to me privately.

29:28.601 --> 29:32.370
This is a highly sensitive operation.

29:32.372 --> 29:35.873
No offense, Agent Hoffman,
but we only met yesterday.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.609
I don't know you.

29:37.611 --> 29:39.177
But I can assure you,

29:39.179 --> 29:42.646
Archer Petit was nowhere near Angela Nix
on the night she disappeared.

29:42.648 --> 29:44.815
- What about the photo?
- What about it?

29:44.817 --> 29:46.550
It's a decent match
to a police sketch.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.753
But then again, so is every other
good looking black dude under 40.

29:49.755 --> 29:51.869
You want to build a case on that?

29:52.357 --> 29:54.758
- Where's Archer now?
- In jail.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.594
In jail? How come?

29:56.596 --> 30:00.029
I put him there.
To sell his cover.

30:00.031 --> 30:04.433
Like I said, this is a
highly sensitive operation.

30:14.577 --> 30:15.877
Don't move!

30:17.681 --> 30:19.047
Hand me your weapon.
Slowly.

30:23.052 --> 30:25.920
Get down on the ground. Face the bar.
Put your hands on your head.

30:30.692 --> 30:32.092
Where's the money, slick?

30:33.895 --> 30:35.663
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:39.568 --> 30:42.670
- Don't irritate me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

30:42.672 --> 30:45.039
Just don't shoot me.
Please.

30:45.041 --> 30:46.506
It's right here.

30:46.508 --> 30:47.674
And don't move.

30:50.077 --> 30:51.878
Cell phones.
In the bag there.

30:58.619 --> 31:00.953
Dealer. Up. Stand up.

31:02.889 --> 31:04.290
Grab that bag.

31:05.358 --> 31:07.292
Hurry up.

31:12.965 --> 31:17.668
Anyone tries to follow me,
I'll kill this bitch.

31:17.936 --> 31:19.603
Go.

31:23.576 --> 31:25.710
Here.

31:25.712 --> 31:27.011
I'll ditch the phones.

31:35.052 --> 31:36.886
Where do you think you're going?

31:36.888 --> 31:38.955
Calm down.
Take it easy now.

31:40.024 --> 31:41.791
Hand over that money.

31:48.666 --> 31:51.633
Come on, don't stand there,
we gotta go.

32:20.690 --> 32:22.056
Jeez.

32:25.461 --> 32:26.761
Is it loaded?

32:26.763 --> 32:27.995
Um...

32:31.333 --> 32:32.432
Yeah.

32:34.235 --> 32:35.471
When should we...

32:35.506 --> 32:37.479
I really need to figure out
the best time.

32:37.573 --> 32:39.773
We gotta make sure
the kids aren't around.

32:39.775 --> 32:41.608
They've had enough
to deal with already.

32:45.813 --> 32:49.181
So many secret conversations
around here.

32:50.650 --> 32:52.785
- You okay?
- Yeah, just, uh...

32:52.787 --> 32:55.554
Just gonna lie down for a bit.

32:57.023 --> 33:00.092
Is he okay?
He seems kind of off.

33:00.094 --> 33:03.095
Oh, he's fine, he's just...

33:03.097 --> 33:05.429
We're both
under a lot of pressure.

33:05.431 --> 33:08.199
Work. Kids. Blah.

33:08.201 --> 33:12.737
I guess out here in the real world,
that kind of stuff is stressful.

33:12.739 --> 33:15.445
It's such a different world
from when I was inside.

33:15.515 --> 33:18.083
Back in Baltimore.

33:18.612 --> 33:21.744
Oh, Lauren, I can't even imagine
what you went through.

33:22.514 --> 33:24.114
Was it okay?

33:24.116 --> 33:25.115
Yeah.

33:26.651 --> 33:30.120
And no, I mean, it's still
a psychiatric hospital.

33:31.789 --> 33:34.324
I'm not saying it wasn't helpful.

33:34.326 --> 33:36.325
You picked the right place.

33:36.327 --> 33:38.694
The good news is
I found a great doctor.

33:40.130 --> 33:45.835
I feel so much more
balanced and engaged.

33:45.837 --> 33:50.773
And I know it's only been a few weeks,
but I feel better than I have in years.

33:50.775 --> 33:52.874
Yeah. Maybe ever.

33:52.876 --> 33:56.344
And who knows, maybe one of these days
I'll get my life together.

33:57.513 --> 33:59.347
Like you.

33:59.349 --> 34:01.783
Right.

34:01.785 --> 34:04.619
What does that mean?

34:04.621 --> 34:09.489
Well, my life's not perfect.
No, far from it. Trust me. It's, uh...

34:13.562 --> 34:14.562
What?

34:18.033 --> 34:20.266
Come on,
it's me you're talking to.

34:23.304 --> 34:24.303
Well.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.007
Brian's having an affair.

34:30.043 --> 34:31.043
What?

34:32.179 --> 34:34.480
Yeah, I found out a few days ago.

34:36.183 --> 34:38.317
I'm so sorry.

34:38.319 --> 34:39.385
Thanks.

34:40.553 --> 34:41.652
Are you...

34:42.655 --> 34:44.355
Are you okay?

34:44.357 --> 34:48.359
Yeah, I mean, we'll get through it.
We just...

34:48.360 --> 34:52.197
We need some time
to work on us, you know?

34:52.199 --> 34:56.433
Which is why I booked you a hotel.
But you stay as long as you want.

34:56.435 --> 34:58.703
No, I understand.

34:58.705 --> 35:01.138
I'll get out of your hair tonight.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.139
You know...

35:04.275 --> 35:09.046
Oh, look at you. You need a tissue.
Oh, God, so do I.

35:13.017 --> 35:14.150
Lauren, wait.

35:16.253 --> 35:19.288
Ellen, what the hell are you
doing with a gun in your purse?

35:19.290 --> 35:23.459
Yes, Ellen, what the hell are you
doing with a gun in your purse?

35:23.461 --> 35:26.362
- Put it on the ground now, Lauren.
- Relax, I'm not some...

35:26.364 --> 35:29.131
- Put the gun on the floor. Now.
- Okay. It's on the floor.

35:29.133 --> 35:30.165
Sit down!

35:31.400 --> 35:33.201
Don't move!

35:33.203 --> 35:34.269
Now!

35:36.740 --> 35:38.607
- Let's go.
- What the hell are you doing?

35:41.344 --> 35:43.545
Ellen!

35:52.989 --> 35:56.124
Please. Please don't hurt her.
This has nothing to do with her!

35:56.126 --> 35:57.625
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

35:57.627 --> 35:59.226
- Outside.
- What for?

35:59.228 --> 36:01.995
You want to play with guns?
I'm gonna give you a lesson.

36:15.109 --> 36:18.210
- Please put the gun away.
- Take the gun.

36:18.212 --> 36:19.278
Take it!

36:22.382 --> 36:25.217
Put a bullet in that tree.
It's, what, 10 feet away?

36:25.219 --> 36:27.519
Just aim and shoot.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.123
Do it, Ellen.

36:32.125 --> 36:35.060
Shoot the tree.
No one will hear a thing.

36:37.262 --> 36:38.629
Again.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.431
Try again.

36:43.603 --> 36:44.602
I...

36:46.271 --> 36:49.706
People who pull guns, but don't
know how to shoot, wind up dead.

36:52.443 --> 36:56.279
I don't want to kill you, Ellen.
You know that.

36:57.348 --> 37:00.718
But that doesn't mean I won't.

37:00.720 --> 37:03.220
Okay, but can we
please just go back inside?

37:03.222 --> 37:05.688
I'm really worried about Lauren.

37:05.690 --> 37:08.958
- Me too.
- Oh, please don't hurt her.

37:11.595 --> 37:15.231
- We don't have a choice.
- What are you saying?

37:15.233 --> 37:17.666
We're going to get rid of her.
Now.

37:19.469 --> 37:20.936
But we're going to do it my way.

37:20.938 --> 37:23.004
No, no, no, no.

37:23.006 --> 37:24.606
No, no, please don't hurt her.

37:45.685 --> 37:49.487
- Hey, my blindfold.
- Keep your mouth shut. You hear me?

37:49.489 --> 37:52.822
What the hell happened?
Why is there blood on your shirt?

37:55.526 --> 37:57.827
One, nothing happened.

37:57.829 --> 38:00.430
Two, I don't have blood
on my shirt.

38:00.432 --> 38:04.200
Three, if you say anything
about this, I will kill you.

38:10.340 --> 38:13.175
Randall Brown,
DC Public Defender's Office.

38:13.177 --> 38:16.712
I have a client in jail who may know
something about the President's nurse.

38:16.714 --> 38:19.548
- The one who allegedly committed suicide.
- I'll handle this, Amy.

38:19.550 --> 38:20.683
Are you in charge
of this investigation?

38:20.685 --> 38:22.350
Would you like to follow me, please?

38:22.352 --> 38:25.253
I've left a number of messages.
No one has returned my calls.

38:25.255 --> 38:27.722
In cases like this, we get a
lot of frivolous testimony.

38:27.724 --> 38:29.557
Inmates looking for deals.

38:29.563 --> 38:32.128
Sadly, most of that information
is not credible.

38:32.262 --> 38:34.696
- Please?
- Well, my client is. I assure you.

38:36.465 --> 38:38.232
Logan, do you need me?

38:38.234 --> 38:40.160
No, I got it.
I'll let you know if it's real.

38:40.166 --> 38:42.097
Okay.

38:53.381 --> 38:55.615
She's never gonna forgive us.

38:55.617 --> 38:57.383
We're saving her life, Jake.

38:58.585 --> 39:00.553
One day she'll thank us.

39:10.464 --> 39:11.897
Where have you been?

39:13.867 --> 39:15.501
I got Sandrine her money.

39:17.270 --> 39:20.172
What? How?

39:21.274 --> 39:22.442
Does it matter?

39:23.977 --> 39:26.945
I told you I'd take care of it.

39:29.615 --> 39:30.882
Good job.

39:39.792 --> 39:43.260
Ellen! Brian!
Call the police, right now!

39:48.835 --> 39:51.769
It's okay. It's okay, Lauren.
Everything's going to be all right.

39:51.771 --> 39:54.505
- What are you doing?
- Just take a deep breath.

39:54.507 --> 39:56.674
Take a deep breath?
He's going to kill us!

39:56.676 --> 39:59.976
He's holding you hostage.
That's why everyone's acting so weird.

39:59.978 --> 40:01.911
Why Brian has a hole
in his stomach.

40:01.913 --> 40:03.613
Please, just calm down.

40:03.615 --> 40:06.416
- Okay, what's wrong with Ellen, hmm?
- She's just trying to help you.

40:06.418 --> 40:09.486
- Okay, someone, please tell me...
- Wait until I'm ready.

40:09.488 --> 40:12.489
Hello?
Why isn't anyone listening to me?

40:12.491 --> 40:15.557
What, have you all
gone completely crazy?

40:15.559 --> 40:18.594
Why are you looking at me
like that?

40:18.596 --> 40:21.864
Thank you for coming,
Dr. Rowley. Please.

40:24.434 --> 40:26.268
I don't understand
what's happening.

40:33.876 --> 40:38.279
Dr. Rowley,
what are you doing here?

40:38.281 --> 40:39.680
I called him.

40:41.283 --> 40:45.719
When your paranoia presented itself.
I had no other option.

40:45.721 --> 40:47.569
And he's here to take you back
to the hospital.

40:47.606 --> 40:49.331
To the hospital?

40:49.758 --> 40:53.192
You're the one who needs help,
not me. Where is he?

40:53.194 --> 40:56.396
Hmm? Where is he? Listen to me.
There's this guy...

40:56.398 --> 40:58.264
He says that he's
a Secret Service agent.

40:58.266 --> 41:03.436
He held a gun to my face.
He blindfolded me. He tied me up.

41:03.438 --> 41:07.339
- And he's holding my sister hostage.
- Relax, Lauren.

41:07.341 --> 41:11.710
Notice where you are. You're safe.
Everyone here is safe.

41:11.712 --> 41:15.714
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You tell him!

41:15.716 --> 41:18.215
You tell him about
the gun and the room!

41:18.217 --> 41:20.885
Lauren, you're scaring the kids.

41:20.887 --> 41:24.856
Okay, Jake. Hey.
Hey. Hey, look at me.

41:24.858 --> 41:27.792
I know that you saw
what happened.

41:27.794 --> 41:29.761
I know that you did.
So, you tell him.

41:31.764 --> 41:33.630
I don't know
what you're talking about.

41:40.438 --> 41:42.372
Why...
Why are you doing this?

41:45.343 --> 41:46.643
To help you.

41:49.780 --> 41:51.347
To save you.

41:54.518 --> 41:56.953
You're gonna have
to come with me, Lauren.

41:56.955 --> 42:00.255
Your sister has Power of Attorney.
It's her decision.

42:00.257 --> 42:02.692
She thinks it's best that you go
back to Sheppard Pratt.

42:02.694 --> 42:04.193
So you'll get well.

42:06.161 --> 42:07.295
I love you.

42:09.775 --> 42:11.752
I love you.

42:31.920 --> 42:33.953
You did the right thing.

42:38.291 --> 42:40.326
We did the right thing.

42:43.531 --> 42:45.831
You're a monster.
