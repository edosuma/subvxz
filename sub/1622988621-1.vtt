Can I be honest, Mr. Tucker?

13:53.190 --> 13:54.657
Please do.

13:56.528 --> 13:59.127
Your son doesn't like me
because...

13:59.262 --> 14:01.103
I'm Mexican.

14:02.235 --> 14:05.141
And I think Dylan believes

14:05.276 --> 14:09.109
a cowboy shouldn't be
from México or...

14:09.244 --> 14:12.443
Argentina
or from somewhere else.

I know that a lot of people
feel that way,

that's the case with Dylan.

14:16.421 --> 14:19.218
Uh, he's a very proud man.
You one-upped him yesterday.

I don't know either.

14:33.032 --> 14:34.565

14:36.075 --> 14:38.504
I always taught my son
to be a proud American,

14:38.639 --> 14:41.212
but maybe I didn't really
teach him what that meant.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.447

We will not be opening
our doors until 7:00 tomorrow

19:47.683 --> 19:49.077
-when the Purge is over.

20:10.404 --> 20:12.336
Make yourself at home.

20:21.244 --> 20:22.446
HARPER: Okay, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

20:22.582 --> 20:23.448
CALEB:
Look at this.

20:23.584 --> 20:25.414
-Good.

20:25.549 --> 20:27.016
Wait, what?

20:27.151 --> 20:30.087
-Dang. -What? How did you know
how to do that?

20:30.223 --> 20:32.230
-

20:34.157 --> 20:35.594
The national holiday
celebrating

20:35.730 --> 20:38.593
our American freedom
is finally back.

20:38.728 --> 20:40.165
Good night, Texas,

20:40.301 --> 20:41.795
and good luck.

20:44.636 --> 20:46.001
It's starting, y'all.

20:46.136 --> 20:48.135
WOMAN
This is not a test.

20:48.271 --> 20:50.645
This is your
Emergency Broadcast System

20:50.780 --> 20:52.809
announcing the commencement
of the annual Purge

20:52.945 --> 20:55.253
sanctioned by
the U.S. government.

21:05.025 --> 21:06.361
WOMAN
...have been granted immunity

21:06.497 --> 21:09.063
from the Purge
and shall not be harmed.

21:09.199 --> 21:10.564
Commencing at the siren,

21:10.700 --> 21:13.095
any and all crime,
including murder...

21:21.975 --> 21:24.808
...at 7:00 a.m.
when the Purge concludes.

21:24.943 --> 21:26.544
Blessed be
our New Founding Fathers

21:26.680 --> 21:29.017
and America, a nation reborn.

21:29.153 --> 21:30.886
May God be with you all.

21:49.705 --> 21:51.102
-CALEB: Hmm.

21:51.238 --> 21:53.233
Well...

21:53.369 --> 21:55.879

22:08.560 --> 22:11.619
-WOMAN: Never! Never again!

22:25.575 --> 22:27.202
-

23:02.211 --> 23:03.909
When in America.

23:06.746 --> 23:09.112
No, that's not what I meant.

23:10.155 --> 23:11.814
What did you mean, then?

23:11.949 --> 23:14.790
That America is everything.

23:18.053 --> 23:20.287
America is México.

23:20.422 --> 23:23.258
America is Africa.
America is Italia.

23:23.393 --> 23:27.004
We can take it all,
we can learn it all,

23:27.139 --> 23:29.638
and we can embrace it.

23:31.605 --> 23:33.807
You really believe that?

23:34.876 --> 23:36.843
That's what I choose
to believe.

23:50.696 --> 23:53.895
boys and girls

23:54.030 --> 23:55.790
Women,
children, me and you

23:57.269 --> 23:58.992
HARPER:
You're so crazy.

24:18.349 --> 24:20.050
-

24:26.125 --> 24:29.728
before you go

24:35.002 --> 24:38.408
tellin' lies...

24:38.544 --> 24:40.170
-

25:07.599 --> 25:09.540
Stupid.

25:42.405 --> 25:43.802
-Baby.
-Jesus.

25:43.937 --> 25:45.803
-What?
-Put the gun down.

25:45.938 --> 25:48.269
What are you doing out here?

25:48.405 --> 25:51.148
I thought I heard something.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.612
It's this damn night.

25:52.747 --> 25:55.249
Dylan Tucker, cut the shit.

25:55.384 --> 25:56.679
Fuck the Purge.

25:56.815 --> 25:58.480
Fuck the NFFA.

25:58.615 --> 26:01.081
They don't get to dictate
how we live our life.

26:01.217 --> 26:03.255
This is our country, okay?

26:03.391 --> 26:07.660
And we can choose to bring
a baby into a world of love.

26:07.795 --> 26:09.430
Why are you laughing at me?

26:09.566 --> 26:11.862
-Damn, honey.
-What?

26:11.998 --> 26:14.000
You just kind of turned me on.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.435

26:29.618 --> 26:30.717
WOMAN:
Hurry up!

26:30.853 --> 26:32.854
-

26:47.672 --> 26:50.070
Ma'am, you should
go back inside.

26:50.205 --> 26:52.905
Just need some air, you know,
just for a moment.

26:56.205 --> 26:57.706
It's my first Purge.

26:57.842 --> 27:00.242
-Is it what you expected?
-Well, there's parts of México

27:00.378 --> 27:02.818
that sound like this
every night.

27:04.455 --> 27:06.352
We got a nice spot here.

27:06.487 --> 27:07.854
Quiet.

27:07.990 --> 27:11.387
Good for you,
easy money for us.

27:11.523 --> 27:13.559

27:17.666 --> 27:18.801
Three bogeys inbound.

27:20.201 --> 27:21.670
MAN
Do not try to hide.

27:21.806 --> 27:25.368
We are the real patriots
of America.

27:26.812 --> 27:31.079
It is our job to keep this land
free and clean.

27:31.215 --> 27:34.345
-We will
no longer tolerate foreigners

27:34.481 --> 27:38.618
raping and pillaging
the United States of America.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.692
We will find you

27:43.828 --> 27:48.094
America will be American
once again.

The purification of America

28:12.291 --> 28:14.214
Help me! Help!

28:19.128 --> 28:20.557
-I have a clear shot.
-LEAD MERC: Don't.

28:20.693 --> 28:23.294
You'll start a war and put
all your people in jeopardy.

28:23.429 --> 28:25.294
MAN
We will not stop until

28:25.430 --> 28:28.565
our great nation
has been fully cleansed.

28:28.701 --> 28:33.234
We will no longer tolerate
foreigners raping and pillaging

28:33.370 --> 28:36.103
the United States of America.

28:36.239 --> 28:38.307
Do not try to hide.

28:38.442 --> 28:42.776
We will find you
and disinfect you.

28:42.911 --> 28:47.153
America will be
American once again.

28:50.055 --> 28:51.454
LEAD MERC:
Hey.

28:52.954 --> 28:55.557
Where'd you learn
to handle a weapon like that?

29:47.380 --> 29:50.313
-

29:50.448 --> 29:52.655
-MAN: Oh, my God.

29:52.790 --> 29:55.683
-It's over.

Harp?
Come on, let's get to work.

30:27.517 --> 30:29.926
-Harper.
-Sis, come on, let's go.

30:36.529 --> 30:38.200
The day after the Purge
should be a holiday.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.469
No?

30:39.605 --> 30:41.436
¿Qué es un holiday?

30:41.571 --> 30:43.533
Holiday? Mm.

30:47.503 --> 30:49.044
Another day, another dollar.

30:50.943 --> 30:52.607

30:52.742 --> 30:56.484
teardrop falls

30:58.724 --> 31:00.385

31:08.065 --> 31:12.133
teardrop falls

NEWSMAN

31:30.990 --> 31:33.121
sanitation crews

31:33.256 --> 31:35.817
with the macabre task
of disinfecting streets

31:35.952 --> 31:38.292
and cleaning corpses
from sidewalks and roadways.

31:38.427 --> 31:41.593
The Purge is over,
and now the cleanup has begun.

31:41.729 --> 31:44.593
All over the state, violent
incidents ended hours ago...

Sir, this is a mistake!

36:21.578 --> 36:23.107
-Wait, please! -DARIUS:
We didn't do anything wrong!

It's so quiet.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.719
Where is everyone?

36:40.361 --> 36:41.389
JUAN:
Oh, come on.

36:41.525 --> 36:43.260
Stop the car.

36:55.407 --> 36:57.247
Well, well, well.

37:02.579 --> 37:04.313
Look at this.

37:14.562 --> 37:16.662
This feels like
fucking Christmas.

37:17.729 --> 37:19.764
Any of y'all get me a present?

37:21.264 --> 37:24.631
Caleb, I know you did,
and let me tell you, sir...

37:24.767 --> 37:27.475
I spent your money well.

37:30.074 --> 37:31.807
Today's your day
of reckoning, cowboy.

37:31.942 --> 37:33.210
-

37:33.346 --> 37:36.680
You become me

37:36.816 --> 37:40.050
-and I become you, huh?
-

37:40.186 --> 37:43.184
The old switcheroo is happening
on every ranch around here.

37:43.319 --> 37:46.725
You and all your rich-ass
neighbors will find out

37:46.860 --> 37:49.457
what it's like to be
penniless and powerless.

37:49.593 --> 37:50.795
To be like us!

37:52.270 --> 37:53.894
These rich motherfuckers
can't hide

37:54.029 --> 37:55.567
behind their steel walls
no more.

37:55.703 --> 37:58.732
This is the way
things are now, boys!

37:58.867 --> 38:00.507
This Purge is forever!

38:00.643 --> 38:01.701
-MAN: Yeah.

38:01.837 --> 38:03.538
This is the real Purge.

38:03.673 --> 38:05.176
The eternal Purge.

38:05.311 --> 38:07.477
Ever After!

38:07.613 --> 38:09.248
MEN:
Ever After!

38:14.049 --> 38:16.183
T.T.:
Ay, cabrón.

38:16.318 --> 38:18.854
-I'm gonna give you a chance

38:18.990 --> 38:20.691
to save your family,
Dylan Tucker,

38:20.827 --> 38:24.100
one by one,
but you'll have to pay.

38:24.236 --> 38:26.230
-Let's start with

38:26.365 --> 38:29.236
eeny, meeny,

38:29.372 --> 38:30.767
-miny, ho!
-

38:30.903 --> 38:32.267
How much would you give
for her, Dylan?

38:32.403 --> 38:34.670
How much would you give to
stop me from putting a bullet

38:34.805 --> 38:36.905
in your baby sister's head?

38:37.041 --> 38:39.745
Let's say ten bucks,
and she lives.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.712
Oh, that seems like
a fair market price

38:41.848 --> 38:43.351
for this broke-down,
useless woman.

38:43.486 --> 38:45.548
Let's see
how much money you got.

38:45.684 --> 38:47.422
Aw, shit, Dylan! I forgot.

38:47.557 --> 38:50.360
You're me now,
which means you're broke.

38:51.727 --> 38:53.759
You have no money.
That sucks, doesn't it?

38:54.825 --> 38:58.263
See, Dylan, without money,

38:58.398 --> 39:00.261
you have no power.

39:00.397 --> 39:03.804
Without money, you can't save
your own little sister,

39:03.940 --> 39:06.370
-and she will die because
of it. -

39:06.506 --> 39:09.269
But how's that feel?

39:10.345 --> 39:11.876
How's that feel, Dylan?

39:14.575 --> 39:17.046
-Feels like shit, doesn't it?
-

39:18.054 --> 39:19.415
That's my life.

39:19.551 --> 39:20.483
It's our life.

39:20.619 --> 39:22.419
That's how we feel.

39:22.555 --> 39:24.954
That's how we have felt

39:25.090 --> 39:26.925
every day
since the day we were born!

39:27.060 --> 39:29.389
And I want you to fucking feel
that fucking pain

39:29.524 --> 39:31.126
-in your fucking stomach,
Dylan! -

39:31.261 --> 39:32.332
Goddamn it,
it looks like the old man's

39:32.467 --> 39:33.733
got something to say! What?!

39:33.868 --> 39:35.628
Damn it! You're right, Kirk!
You're right!

39:35.763 --> 39:37.405
-You're right! -I don't give
a fuck if you think I'm right!

39:37.541 --> 39:39.905
You're talking about
life in America,

39:40.040 --> 39:42.842
the way the rich get rich
off the backs of the poor,

39:42.977 --> 39:46.642
the way it's been
ever since we robbed this land

39:46.778 --> 39:49.116
from the Native Americans.

39:49.252 --> 39:51.786
But you got no right

39:51.921 --> 39:56.421
to complain about the
very system you're supporting

39:56.556 --> 39:57.656
by picking up that gun

39:57.792 --> 39:59.159
and sanctioning
the goddamn Purge...

39:59.294 --> 40:01.022
We need more guns.

40:01.158 --> 40:02.663
CALEB:
...which is all about money.

40:05.933 --> 40:09.000
You know who created
the Purge, don't ya?

40:09.135 --> 40:14.376
A bunch of fat, rich
businessmen in Washington, D.C.

40:14.512 --> 40:17.111
So what would
that make you, Kirk?

40:17.247 --> 40:19.381
What would it make you?

40:19.517 --> 40:23.348
Huh? That would make you
their lackey

40:23.484 --> 40:26.116

40:26.251 --> 40:29.620
They expect you to go out there
and do their violence,

40:29.755 --> 40:31.327
so they can play more golf.

40:31.463 --> 40:32.660
They've never even been
in a fistfight.

40:36.626 --> 40:38.727
So...

40:38.862 --> 40:41.630

There's no such thing
as crime anymore.

1:09:16.150 --> 1:09:18.047
There's nothing you can do.

1:09:18.182 --> 1:09:20.214
Drop 'em.

1:09:20.349 --> 1:09:21.545
You, too, amigo.

1:09:21.681 --> 1:09:22.683
Come on, now.

1:09:22.819 --> 1:09:25.259
You're surrounded.
You will be shot.

1:09:28.822 --> 1:09:30.925
ELIJAH:
That a boy.

1:09:31.995 --> 1:09:34.430
It's all right, pretty thing.
Come on, now.

1:09:34.565 --> 1:09:36.369
-Do it.
-

1:09:37.403 --> 1:09:39.602
ELIJAH:
Nice and easy. Good.

1:09:39.737 --> 1:09:41.600
MOTHER HARDIN:
You fucking deaf, son?

1:09:43.603 --> 1:09:45.246
Good boy.

1:09:46.577 --> 1:09:48.816
ELIJAH:
Look what we got here.

1:09:48.951 --> 1:09:51.315
Couple of bad hombres.

1:09:51.451 --> 1:09:52.650
MOTHER HARDIN:
Well, I'll be.

1:09:52.785 --> 1:09:54.388
-There's two of us
and two of them. -ELIJAH: Mm.

1:09:54.523 --> 1:09:55.949
That right there is
what's wrong with this country.

1:09:56.084 --> 1:09:57.489
What do you want to do
about 'em, Daddy?

1:09:57.625 --> 1:09:59.951
Why don't we give
our fellow Americans here

1:10:00.087 --> 1:10:02.427
an opportunity
to redeem themselves?

1:10:02.563 --> 1:10:04.163
MOTHER HARDIN:
Yeah, I like the sound of that.

1:10:04.298 --> 1:10:05.932
ELIJAH:
Mm, let me explain.

1:10:06.067 --> 1:10:09.134
You kill the brownies,

1:10:09.269 --> 1:10:11.800
and the two of you can live,

1:10:11.935 --> 1:10:16.134
stay here in this great,
God-loving country.

1:10:16.270 --> 1:10:19.137
Help us purify this nation
once and for all.

1:10:19.272 --> 1:10:22.712
That's what the
Ever After Purge is all about.

1:10:23.743 --> 1:10:25.979
Fuck you, redneck.

1:10:27.418 --> 1:10:28.921
Yeah, fuck you, pig.

1:10:29.057 --> 1:10:30.591
No, fuck you, bitch!

1:10:30.726 --> 1:10:32.917
This country's gone haywire.
It don't know itself no more.

1:10:33.053 --> 1:10:34.789
You don't fucking
know yourself.

1:10:34.925 --> 1:10:36.428
ELIJAH: Mother, Mother,
Mother, it's okay.

1:10:36.564 --> 1:10:37.930
MOTHER HARDIN:
Look in the fucking mirror!

1:10:38.066 --> 1:10:39.630
Mother! Hey, it's okay.

1:10:41.169 --> 1:10:43.161
Maybe this will help y'all.

1:10:46.902 --> 1:10:48.201
MOTHER HARDIN:
You happy now?

1:10:48.337 --> 1:10:49.970
Mother.

1:10:51.010 --> 1:10:52.247

MOTHER HARDIN:
Let the purification begin.

1:11:12.667 --> 1:11:14.225
-MOTHER HARDIN: You whore.

1:11:14.361 --> 1:11:17.235
Fucking dying?
Oh, you fucking little beaner.

1:11:17.371 --> 1:11:19.664
You fucking ain't worth shit.

1:11:19.799 --> 1:11:21.837
Get the fuck back.

1:11:24.841 --> 1:11:26.446
Don't even think about it,
brownie.

1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:29.746
SOLDIER:
This is the NFFA!

1:11:29.881 --> 1:11:31.809
Lay down your weapons,
or you will be shot.

1:11:31.945 --> 1:11:33.816
ELIJAH:
Shoot the pigs!

1:11:35.222 --> 1:11:37.017
Mother! Call for backup!

1:11:38.354 --> 1:11:40.053
Shit.

1:11:40.188 --> 1:11:43.221
Backup! Backup!
We need backup, goddamn it!

1:11:44.792 --> 1:11:46.829
Backup's coming, baby.

1:11:50.402 --> 1:11:52.164
-Fuck!

1:12:04.854 --> 1:12:06.351

1:12:24.070 --> 1:12:26.235
Mother!

1:12:26.370 --> 1:12:27.236
Mother, no.

1:12:27.371 --> 1:12:28.937
No, no, Mother.

1:12:42.291 --> 1:12:44.387
ELIJAH:
This is Alpha Leader.

1:13:05.774 --> 1:13:07.613
Help me with the door.

1:13:13.949 --> 1:13:16.050
Are you sure that this is safe?

1:13:28.663 --> 1:13:30.161
Stay over there.

Cassie. Oh, my God.

1:14:56.685 --> 1:14:57.888
You okay?

1:14:59.555 --> 1:15:01.386
T.T.?

NEWSWOMAN
We have breaking news now.

1:15:10.266 --> 1:15:12.100
This is just coming in.
We have been notified

1:15:12.235 --> 1:15:14.241
that there has been
an attack in El Paso

1:15:14.377 --> 1:15:15.904
at a U.S. Army military base.

1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:17.905
As a result,
the NFFA is pulling all

1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:19.305
military troops out of El Paso.

1:15:19.441 --> 1:15:22.216
Again, the military is
retreating out of El Paso

1:15:22.352 --> 1:15:24.912
after suffering massive losses

1:15:25.048 --> 1:15:26.477
in their battle
against purgers,

1:15:26.612 --> 1:15:29.656
including an attack
on a U.S. Army base.

1:15:29.791 --> 1:15:31.956

their El Paso border
crossing point immediately.

1:15:37.393 --> 1:15:39.997
Again, the El Paso border point
will no longer be open

1:15:40.132 --> 1:15:42.737
to United States citizens
fleeing the Forever Purge.

1:15:42.872 --> 1:15:45.936
Americans left behind
at the now closed border wall

1:15:46.071 --> 1:15:48.268
are being slaughtered
by purgers. It is a war.

1:15:48.403 --> 1:15:51.074
El Paso has fallen
to Ever After purgers

1:15:51.209 --> 1:15:53.338
who are going door-to-door
hunting down anyone

1:15:53.474 --> 1:15:55.109
who is not a part
of their hate group.

1:15:55.244 --> 1:15:57.616

you can feel there's
a change in the air...

1:16:05.452 --> 1:16:08.161
This city's gonna get
even worse.

1:16:08.296 --> 1:16:10.125
Ven. Come.

1:16:11.596 --> 1:16:13.264
Get out the back.

1:16:13.399 --> 1:16:14.798
Find Chiago.

1:16:14.933 --> 1:16:16.967
Move fast.
Tell him to meet us

1:16:17.102 --> 1:16:19.935
in the corner of, uh,
Amboy and Highland.

1:16:20.071 --> 1:16:21.676
Tell him,
if he doesn't do this,

1:16:21.811 --> 1:16:25.008
many good people will die,
including me. Okay?

1:16:29.011 --> 1:16:30.881

PURGE ANNOUNCER:

This city is now occupied by
the real patriots of America.

1:16:49.499 --> 1:16:53.706
Our duty is to uphold
American beliefs and values

We control El Paso

1:17:15.388 --> 1:17:17.932
The purification will not stop.

1:17:18.067 --> 1:17:21.160
This city is now occupied by
the real patriots of America.

They're headed for the border

Follow 'em. Don't lose 'em.

1:18:37.137 --> 1:18:38.471

1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:12.944
How are you getting us across?

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:15.012
My tribe has lived
right on the border

1:19:15.147 --> 1:19:17.675
of the U.S. and Mexico
for centuries.

1:19:17.811 --> 1:19:21.013
We were the only people
who could legally cross.

1:19:21.149 --> 1:19:22.790
Then the wall split us.

1:19:24.917 --> 1:19:27.855
But there are parts of
the terrain los pendejos

1:19:27.991 --> 1:19:29.493
can't build the wall on.

1:19:29.629 --> 1:19:31.663
Too dangerous.

1:19:31.799 --> 1:19:34.400
And we use it to make passage.

1:19:34.536 --> 1:19:36.835
We'll take you through.

1:19:36.971 --> 1:19:39.664
Some of you deserve
another chance.

You'll be okay.

You go let these people get you

-Yeah, you go ahead.

1:21:39.424 --> 1:21:40.684
I love you.
I'll be right behind you.

-Don't leave me.
-Go. I have to stop them.

1:21:43.629 --> 1:21:44.765
-No, baby. You cannot leave me.
-You just focus on the baby.

1:21:44.901 --> 1:21:46.457
-Okay?
-Cassie, I'll protect you.

1:21:46.593 --> 1:21:47.534
