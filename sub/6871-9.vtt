WEBVTT

00:01.196 --> 00:02.729
<i>I am dead serious.</i>

00:02.781 --> 00:05.431
<i>From now on, no eggs,</i>
<i>no pigs' feet,</i>

00:05.500 --> 00:06.900
<i>nothing pickled,</i>

00:06.968 --> 00:08.401
or, so help me God,

00:08.470 --> 00:10.870
I will put that refrigerator
out by the curb.

00:10.939 --> 00:12.372
What?
Oh, come on!

00:12.440 --> 00:14.163
Those weren't pigs' feet.

00:14.910 --> 00:18.144
Whatever feet, idiot!

00:18.213 --> 00:19.913
Now then, we have an assignment,

00:19.981 --> 00:21.714
but I won't be joining you,

00:21.783 --> 00:24.083
so if you'll direct your
goldfish-like attention spans

00:24.152 --> 00:25.485
to Mr. Slater...

00:25.554 --> 00:28.288
Just Slater,
for the "infinitieth" time.

00:28.356 --> 00:29.822
Watch it.
Shut up.

00:29.891 --> 00:31.057
Burn.
Shut up.

00:31.126 --> 00:32.659
Burn.

00:32.726 --> 00:33.826
Okay...

00:33.895 --> 00:35.016
The young man in the monitor

00:35.063 --> 00:36.763
is Crown prince Fawad Fawaz,

00:36.831 --> 00:38.932
heir to the throne
of the Kingdom of Durhan.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.067
He just got a summer internship
on Wall Street...

00:41.136 --> 00:42.936
Ugh, affirmative action...

00:43.004 --> 00:46.940
And so he's in the city looking
for suitable accommodations,

00:47.008 --> 00:48.942
something befitting
the world's richest prince.

00:49.010 --> 00:50.877
Oh, money.
Holy shit.

00:50.946 --> 00:52.812
And so what,
he needs bodyguards?

00:52.881 --> 00:55.998
Mm, no,
I think he's all set there...

00:57.385 --> 00:58.851
Which brings us to my problem,

00:58.920 --> 01:01.154
which, coincidentally,
is also your problem.

01:01.223 --> 01:03.590
Without the prince or his
security team's knowledge,

01:03.658 --> 01:06.593
I need to scan any and all
of his mobile phones,

01:06.661 --> 01:08.161
any and all flash drives,

01:08.230 --> 01:10.496
both of his handprints,
and both of his retinas.

01:10.565 --> 01:12.098
And why?

01:12.167 --> 01:13.833
Oh, sorry, let me back up.

01:13.902 --> 01:15.835
This is part of
operation because I said so.

01:15.904 --> 01:17.937
Ya know what?
I'm sure I do.

01:18.006 --> 01:20.840
For example,
this is a tranquilizer gun,

01:20.909 --> 01:22.575
with which I will dart
the prince,

01:22.644 --> 01:24.978
and then we'll have 60
seconds to do all the scans

01:25.046 --> 01:26.980
before he wakes up
with no side effects

01:27.048 --> 01:29.115
and no memory at all
of the previous few minutes.

01:29.184 --> 01:32.552
Bullshit, the CIA
doesn't have that technolo--

01:32.621 --> 01:34.721
But before
I can tranquilize him,

01:34.789 --> 01:36.322
I need access
to the prince, so--

01:36.391 --> 01:37.957
Uh, and just so we're clear,

01:38.026 --> 01:40.513
he's the prince of Durhan,
an allied country.

01:40.551 --> 01:43.285
Yeah, I'm gonna refer you back
to operation said so.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.654
Everybody else, these are
your mission dossiers.

01:45.723 --> 01:47.155
Read them on the way
to Tunt Manor.

01:47.224 --> 01:49.689
Tunt Manor? That's my house!

01:49.809 --> 01:50.949
I know!

01:51.069 --> 01:52.945
And the prince is on his way there.

01:53.065 --> 01:55.512
So we're going there,
and because you know the property,

01:55.632 --> 01:57.332
you'll be posing
as the listing agent!

01:59.236 --> 02:01.069
Shut up!
Burn!

02:01.138 --> 02:03.238
Well, just in case
I don't read this...

02:03.307 --> 02:04.906
What are the rest of us
gonna be doing?

02:04.975 --> 02:07.943
Some of you will be assisting
me and/or Miss Tunt.

02:08.011 --> 02:10.779
The rest of you will be distracting
the prince's security team

02:10.848 --> 02:12.080
and/or his mother...

02:12.149 --> 02:13.982
Her Majesty, Queen Yasmin Fawaz.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.585
Whoa, shit.
Damn.

02:18.188 --> 02:19.454
Seriously?

02:19.523 --> 02:21.390
What?
I just heard you get hard.

02:21.458 --> 02:22.824
Ew.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.326
They were goat feet,

02:24.395 --> 02:26.061
and you threw 'em out!

02:26.130 --> 02:27.996
Ah, damn you!

02:28.065 --> 02:31.287
God damn you all to hell!

02:32.770 --> 02:35.937
So... the van's
downstairs.

03:13.197 --> 03:16.289
Turn around.
Now spread your arms.

03:16.719 --> 03:19.019
I do apologize for this
necessary precaution,

03:19.088 --> 03:21.455
Miss...
Oh, uh--

03:21.524 --> 03:23.157
what do I always tell you?

03:23.226 --> 03:24.425
Never apologize.

03:24.494 --> 03:26.193
It is a sign of weakness.

03:26.262 --> 03:27.461
Yes, mother.

03:27.530 --> 03:29.764
So, Miss...
Uh... Escrow.

03:29.832 --> 03:32.099
My last name is Escrow.
Really?

03:32.168 --> 03:35.870
<i>Yes, and trust me,</i>
<i>I've heard all the jokes.</i>

03:35.938 --> 03:38.139
Oh, boy.

03:38.207 --> 03:40.808
Okay, chinstrap, let me see what
we got on the other cameras.

03:40.877 --> 03:43.210
Bathroom one, bathroom
two, bathroom three,

03:43.279 --> 03:45.045
bathroom four,
bathroom five--

03:45.114 --> 03:46.529
Are all the cameras
in bathrooms?

03:46.649 --> 03:48.149
No. Just my faves.

03:48.217 --> 03:51.886
Bathroom six,
bathroom seven, bathr--

03:51.954 --> 03:53.533
Shoulda gotten some poison ones.

03:53.653 --> 03:56.357
Okay, people, I want you in
position in five minutes.

03:56.425 --> 03:59.760
You should've thought of that before
you picked these ridiculous costumes,

03:59.829 --> 04:01.996
and why are your plans
always so complicated?

04:02.064 --> 04:05.599
You're like Wile E. Coyote with access
to predator drones. Out.

04:05.668 --> 04:07.902
I think these uniforms
are awesome!

04:07.970 --> 04:09.291
Here, let me get
some pics of you!

04:09.305 --> 04:11.005
To masturbate to?

04:11.073 --> 04:13.874
Pfff, please.

04:13.943 --> 04:15.242
Please?

04:15.311 --> 04:17.411
Can somebody explain
to me why the CIA

04:17.480 --> 04:19.480
is spying on American allies?

04:19.548 --> 04:21.982
Well, Ray, there were these
things called dinosaurs,

04:22.051 --> 04:24.552
and when they died,
they turned into oil, somehow,

04:24.620 --> 04:26.654
and that's what
your car uses for food.

04:26.722 --> 04:27.855
Thanks, Al.

04:27.924 --> 04:29.323
Al?
Jazeera!

04:29.392 --> 04:31.225
Look, for all we know,
Slater wants all that stuff

04:31.294 --> 04:34.361
because the CIA is trying
to protect the royal family.

04:34.430 --> 04:36.397
From what?
Cabals.

04:36.465 --> 04:37.498
What?

04:37.567 --> 04:39.533
Yes, sinister cabals!

04:39.602 --> 04:41.869
I bet the royal palace
is lousy with them.

04:41.938 --> 04:44.405
So instead of trying to
undermine the mission...

04:44.473 --> 04:46.440
Don't undermine it!

04:46.509 --> 04:48.209
What the heck got into him?

04:48.277 --> 04:50.911
More like what he wants
to get into,

04:50.980 --> 04:52.713
which, obviously,
the queen's vagina.

04:52.782 --> 04:54.548
Seriously?

04:54.617 --> 04:56.116
Or wherever else.

04:56.185 --> 04:58.085
Although she didn't look
like a Back Dorothy.

04:58.154 --> 05:00.988
Well we'll just see
about that...

05:01.057 --> 05:03.190
The part about Archer
having sex with the queen,

05:03.259 --> 05:06.427
not the part about the queen
being into anal sex. Who knows?

05:06.495 --> 05:08.429
Wow.
This is eerily similar

05:08.497 --> 05:11.599
to my spec script for <i>Masterpiece Theater.</i>
Your what?

05:11.667 --> 05:14.186
Well, I guess
technically it's fanfic.

05:14.306 --> 05:17.936
Bringing us to the formal
dining room, which seats 80,

05:17.972 --> 05:21.171
with plenty of room
for servants to skulk around,

05:21.291 --> 05:23.978
Ladling turtle soup
into sterling silver bowls,

05:24.046 --> 05:27.531
their sullen eyes downcast
as grandmamÃ¡ makes a joke

05:27.617 --> 05:28.866
about chopping off their hands

05:28.951 --> 05:30.984
if they spill
even a single drop,

05:31.037 --> 05:34.822
like we used to do
in the Belgian Congo.

05:34.891 --> 05:37.091
Hm. And how about
that chandelier, huh?

05:37.159 --> 05:40.160
But I wouldn't wanna dust it!

05:40.229 --> 05:42.229
An opinion apparently
shared by the staff

05:42.298 --> 05:43.797
about the rest the furnishings.

05:43.866 --> 05:45.733
If this were my palace, I'd--

05:45.801 --> 05:48.002
What did I tell you, wench?
Ow!

05:48.070 --> 05:49.603
Stop right there!
Who are you?

05:49.672 --> 05:51.505
I am... Butler.

05:51.574 --> 05:52.773
The butler.

05:52.842 --> 05:56.010
Wait, your name
is Butler, or--?

05:56.078 --> 05:59.446
Both!
And I've heard every joke!

05:59.515 --> 06:01.415
My sincere apologies,
Your Majesty,

06:01.484 --> 06:03.250
for the deplorable state
of the house.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.519
Good help is difficult to find,

06:04.553 --> 06:06.620
as I'm sure
Your Majesty well knows.

06:06.689 --> 06:08.756
What I know, you impudent toad,

06:08.824 --> 06:11.158
is that if a servant dared
speak to me in my palace,

06:11.227 --> 06:14.061
I would have him sewn into
a burlap sack filled with rats,

06:14.130 --> 06:15.663
and the sack thrown
into the river.

06:15.731 --> 06:17.898
Burn!

06:17.967 --> 06:20.100
Well slapped, Your Majesty.

06:20.169 --> 06:21.969
Come! Let's get
this over with

06:22.038 --> 06:24.672
so I can bathe off
all this filth and grime.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.507
Oh, my God,
can you believe this?

06:26.575 --> 06:27.775
What?
What?

06:27.843 --> 06:30.311
My commission is gonna be huge!

06:30.379 --> 06:32.112
Come, you foolish woman!

06:32.181 --> 06:33.847
Coming, My Majesty!

06:33.916 --> 06:36.183
Now, is anyone allergic
to ocelots?

06:36.252 --> 06:37.618
Oh, that's right, Babou!

06:37.687 --> 06:40.621
Ow, man,
what a hate-slappin' bitch.

06:40.690 --> 06:43.490
Yeah, I gotta have sex with her.
Wait, what?

06:43.559 --> 06:46.360
But I thought you and Lana
were kinda, you know...

06:46.429 --> 06:48.195
Kinda, you know, what?
What'd she say?

06:48.264 --> 06:51.031
Well, nothing, but--
See? Classic Lana!

06:51.100 --> 06:53.200
So what, you're gonna try
to bang the queen

06:53.269 --> 06:54.568
just to make Lana jealous?

06:54.637 --> 06:56.537
No.
That'll just be icing

06:56.605 --> 07:00.708
- on what I assume will be
an extremely moist cake... - Blorp.

07:00.776 --> 07:02.509
Because I've had sex
with a baroness,

07:02.578 --> 07:05.813
a marquise, a vicomtesse,
the two princess sisters,

07:05.881 --> 07:07.314
um, a duchess--

07:07.383 --> 07:09.483
Your mom's dog?
No.

07:09.552 --> 07:11.385
The wife of a duke?

07:11.454 --> 07:13.954
Yes, but I've never had sex
with a queen.

07:14.023 --> 07:17.992
Yasmin would be my greatest
masterpiece, Pam, my-- hang on...

07:18.060 --> 07:20.127
Moaning Lisa.

07:20.196 --> 07:22.463
Dammit, I was gonna say that.

07:22.531 --> 07:24.398
Girl with a pearl necklace.

07:24.467 --> 07:28.068
The potato eaters.

07:28.137 --> 07:29.715
Stop it!
But wait.

07:29.835 --> 07:32.958
Why are you telling me
your plan to not make Lana jealous?

07:33.078 --> 07:35.204
I dunno, I--
Oh, my god, Pam,

07:35.324 --> 07:36.724
I think you
might be my best friend.

07:36.812 --> 07:38.012
You're my best friend!

07:38.080 --> 07:39.246
What about Cheryl?

07:39.315 --> 07:41.348
You're my second best friend!

07:41.417 --> 07:43.217
Oh, my God...
What?

07:43.285 --> 07:45.686
Eh, I thought by now
I'd be doing a lot better

07:45.755 --> 07:47.554
in the old friend department.

07:47.623 --> 07:49.556
I thought by now I'd be dead.

07:49.625 --> 07:51.091
Well, day's not over...

07:51.160 --> 07:52.092
Right?

07:52.161 --> 07:53.394
He what?

07:53.462 --> 07:54.795
I mean-- so what?

07:54.864 --> 07:56.864
Well, I just figured
you'd wanna know.

07:56.932 --> 07:58.499
No, you just figured
it would make me jealous,

07:58.567 --> 08:00.034
but, spoiler alert,

08:00.102 --> 08:02.102
I don't give a shit
who Archer bangs.

08:02.171 --> 08:04.671
Well, yeah, no, but if you did,

08:04.740 --> 08:07.241
and you wanted
to make Archer jealous...

08:07.309 --> 08:08.675
Then I'd go break my pussy off

08:08.744 --> 08:10.544
on that hot little
prince's merguez.

08:10.613 --> 08:13.547
Exactly, that's what I'm--
Wait, what?

08:13.616 --> 08:15.182
Which, come to think of it,

08:15.251 --> 08:17.418
would be what my vagina
refers to as a "win-win."

08:17.486 --> 08:18.852
But wait a minute!
Love to, can't,

08:18.921 --> 08:20.154
got a pussy to break.

08:21.524 --> 08:24.131
Well, that backfired.

08:25.261 --> 08:26.994
Or did it?

08:28.631 --> 08:31.031
Yes, yes, it most certainly did.

08:32.373 --> 08:34.167
Okay, people, listen up.

08:34.287 --> 08:35.470
If you're not in position,

08:35.549 --> 08:37.220
you'd better get there
A.S.A.P. because--

08:37.340 --> 08:39.051
Uh, what's that?

08:40.306 --> 08:41.380
Because right about now,

08:41.500 --> 08:43.337
Cheryl should be leading
the Durhanis into...

08:43.410 --> 08:46.378
The world-renowned
conservatory!

08:46.447 --> 08:49.014
Where Gillette should be ready
with a transdermal solution

08:49.083 --> 08:51.150
of the most powerful
laxative known to man.

08:51.218 --> 08:53.552
I-- dammit,
I had something for this--

08:53.621 --> 08:55.754
Wait, was it
something about Dukes?

08:55.823 --> 08:58.257
The Tunt Conservatory
is home to the world's

08:58.325 --> 09:00.659
second largest collection
of carnivorous plants,

09:00.728 --> 09:02.194
the shame of which drove

09:02.263 --> 09:03.996
the current owners'
eccentric great-uncle,

09:04.064 --> 09:06.165
Theophilus Tunt,
to commit suicide.

09:06.233 --> 09:07.800
Or maybe it was
just the syphilis.

09:07.868 --> 09:09.201
We may never know,

09:09.270 --> 09:10.636
and, frankly,
it's none of our b--

09:10.704 --> 09:12.404
Bathroom?
What?

09:12.473 --> 09:13.872
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,

09:13.941 --> 09:15.874
I don't know what's wrong,
but I need to--

09:15.943 --> 09:17.242
Mother!
Silence!

09:17.311 --> 09:18.844
How dare you?

09:18.913 --> 09:22.314
Indeed.
Well slapped, His Majesty.

09:22.383 --> 09:24.550
Now, if you will
follow me, into the--

09:24.618 --> 09:27.019
Bathroom!
Please, Your Majesty! I cannot wait!

09:27.087 --> 09:29.721
I told you idiots that wasn't
the real famous Ray's!

09:29.790 --> 09:32.658
A thousand pardons.
Foolish woman! Where is a bathroom?

09:32.726 --> 09:35.527
Where isn't a bathroom?

09:35.596 --> 09:37.463
Am I right?

09:37.531 --> 09:39.465
All kidding aside, though,
the house does have

09:39.533 --> 09:41.733
22 full
and 18 half-baths,

09:41.802 --> 09:44.269
all boasting priceless
grueby faience tilework,

09:44.338 --> 09:46.638
as well as--

09:46.707 --> 09:49.875
cucumber water bidets!

09:49.944 --> 09:53.879
Now, if your assorted majesties and
highnesses will please follow me...

09:53.948 --> 09:56.882
To elevator number three, where
whats-her-face should be standing by...

09:56.951 --> 09:58.884
10-4 on the 20,
come back.

09:58.953 --> 10:01.053
Stop it!
She will bring the prince upstairs,

10:01.121 --> 10:03.555
where Archer and Lana are
waiting to bring him to me--

10:03.624 --> 10:04.756
<i>What? Wait, what?</i>

10:04.825 --> 10:06.124
What?
What's that?

10:06.193 --> 10:08.827
Are you in position?
Yes?

10:08.896 --> 10:10.028
<i>Yeah, I am...</i>

10:10.097 --> 10:11.430
So I'm not really sure

10:11.499 --> 10:13.665
why you're using
that pissy tone with me--

10:13.734 --> 10:15.100
<i>I--</i>
Unless I sound like Lana,

10:15.169 --> 10:16.368
who is-- hang on--

10:16.437 --> 10:17.870
looking around the position,

10:17.938 --> 10:20.806
and she is...

10:20.875 --> 10:23.442
not in position.
<i>Well, where the hell is she?</i>

10:23.511 --> 10:25.143
Yeah. Stand by?

10:25.212 --> 10:27.312
[Glass shatters,
radio feeds back]

10:27.381 --> 10:28.881
Jeez! Ow!

10:28.949 --> 10:31.184
Ow!
<i>What's that?</i>

10:33.420 --> 10:35.654
Hey, speaking of Lana
and positions...

10:35.723 --> 10:38.524
Cyril, I either can't or merely
don't want to talk right now, so--

10:38.592 --> 10:41.293
Cowgirl? Wheelbarrow?
Butter churn?

10:41.362 --> 10:44.965
Okay, Gollum, you have won
the game of riddles.

10:45.085 --> 10:46.786
The gold ring is yours!

10:46.906 --> 10:48.721
Lana and the prince, you idiot!

10:48.841 --> 10:51.452
I-- wait, what about
Lana and the prince?

10:51.572 --> 10:53.905
Bow-chicka-dow-dow...

10:55.576 --> 10:56.542
Ow!

10:56.610 --> 10:58.377
Ow!

11:00.214 --> 11:03.949
So, that backfired...

11:04.018 --> 11:05.817
Maybe I should work
on my timing.

11:09.924 --> 11:12.324
Please... someone...
Just kill me...

11:12.393 --> 11:14.493
Be careful what you wish for!

11:14.562 --> 11:16.762
Especially
if it's claustrophobic,

11:16.830 --> 11:20.399
manually-operated elevators!

11:20.467 --> 11:22.000
Because this is what
you would get.

11:22.069 --> 11:23.402
And I am embarrassed to say

11:23.470 --> 11:25.837
that I have room
for only one passenger.

11:25.906 --> 11:28.373
Where, in your belly?

11:28.442 --> 11:29.908
Burn.
What?

11:29.977 --> 11:31.944
Return!
I shall take His Highness,

11:32.012 --> 11:34.112
and then I shall
speedily return for--

11:34.181 --> 11:35.881
Your Majesty.

11:35.950 --> 11:38.450
Whoa.
Oh, my God.

11:38.519 --> 11:40.185
Damn, Gina.

11:40.254 --> 11:43.355
If it please Your Majesty,
take the elevator.

11:43.424 --> 11:46.959
I will escort His Highness
upstairs via...

11:47.027 --> 11:48.560
a more scenic route.

11:50.464 --> 11:51.730
Out of the question!

11:51.799 --> 11:53.065
I don't want him alone
without--

11:53.133 --> 11:55.367
Mother, this sounds
like a win-win.

11:55.436 --> 11:57.102
Pardon,
but I'm supposed to--

11:57.171 --> 12:00.939
Mother!
Woman, I will kill you where you stand!

12:01.008 --> 12:03.008
Which, by law
I'm required to tell you,

12:03.077 --> 12:04.910
if there's been a murder
in the house--

12:04.979 --> 12:07.012
oh, but if you
were the murderer...

12:07.081 --> 12:09.448
That's what I love
about this job!

12:09.516 --> 12:10.882
You learn something
new every--

12:10.951 --> 12:12.595
Mother, please!

12:14.688 --> 12:17.756
Fawad, habibi, I shall meet
you upstairs momentarily.

12:17.825 --> 12:20.292
Mind you, do not tarry.

12:20.361 --> 12:21.393
Well?

12:21.462 --> 12:22.661
Blorp.

12:22.730 --> 12:24.234
What the hell?

12:26.467 --> 12:29.037
Where is everybody?
Here! Present!

12:29.157 --> 12:30.530
Hey, where's Lana?
What the--

12:30.650 --> 12:31.737
Well, she's not in here,

12:31.805 --> 12:33.499
which is where you also
shouldn't be!

12:33.619 --> 12:34.506
What?
What?

12:34.575 --> 12:36.108
Why aren't you in position?

12:36.176 --> 12:37.442
Because, Slater,
there's a--

12:37.511 --> 12:39.411
a problem with
your tranquilizer gun.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.579
What problem?

12:42.016 --> 12:44.182
It goes off for, like,
no reason.

12:44.251 --> 12:47.419
Where's Lana?
I'm not even a hundred percent sure

12:47.488 --> 12:50.489
where I am right now, so--

12:50.557 --> 12:53.325
You are hands down
my new favorite thing.

12:53.394 --> 12:56.294
<i>Hello? Anybody?</i>
What the-- Ray?

12:56.363 --> 12:57.629
Is that you?
<i>Yeah, I need--</i>

12:57.698 --> 12:59.398
Good, get off,
keep this channel open.

12:59.466 --> 13:02.025
<i>No, I need you guys to--</i>
Keep this channel open!

13:04.133 --> 13:06.590
God, these people.
Always "me, me, me."

13:06.920 --> 13:08.567
Hey, pretty girl...

13:09.243 --> 13:11.677
Or boy, or gender-fluid,

13:11.745 --> 13:14.246
or however
you self-identify,

13:14.314 --> 13:15.981
it's all good.

13:16.050 --> 13:19.284
Although that being said...
Hyahh!

13:27.361 --> 13:29.394
Blorp.

13:32.415 --> 13:34.049
[Slater yawns]

13:34.169 --> 13:37.094
Okay, let's do this!

13:37.162 --> 13:39.029
Whats-yer-face, Pam,
what's your--

13:39.098 --> 13:41.698
What the shit?
What's that?

13:41.767 --> 13:43.467
Hey, you.

13:43.535 --> 13:45.469
What the hell
are you people doing?

13:45.537 --> 13:48.805
Thinking about some breakfast,
am I right?

13:48.874 --> 13:50.707
Oh, my God, chilaquiles?

13:50.776 --> 13:54.254
What the--? Where the hell
is my tranquilizer gun?

13:54.374 --> 13:55.327
Your what?

13:55.781 --> 13:57.247
Your Highness?

13:57.316 --> 13:59.683
Could you help me in here,
please?

13:59.752 --> 14:02.019
And so, beckoned by the servant,

14:02.087 --> 14:05.055
a powerful negress giant,
Fawad entered the boudoir

14:05.124 --> 14:06.723
and soon became a man...

14:08.260 --> 14:11.094
I seem to have fallen.

14:11.163 --> 14:14.356
I-- I seem
to see that...

14:14.476 --> 14:16.128
Can you help me up...

14:16.535 --> 14:18.635
or vice versa?

14:18.703 --> 14:20.970
I think perhaps both?
Ideally?

14:21.039 --> 14:23.473
Or rather, both,
ideally, would be--

14:25.577 --> 14:27.771
Hello? Prince?

14:28.121 --> 14:31.751
Kid, c'mon, I mean, I know I've been
crushing the post-natal yoga, but--

14:32.175 --> 14:33.632
Seriously,
did you have a stroke?

14:33.752 --> 14:35.852
[Archer, chuckling] Seriously?
[Gasps]

14:35.921 --> 14:38.188
You honestly thought you were
so physically attractive

14:38.256 --> 14:41.320
that you caused a healthy
young man to literally--

14:41.440 --> 14:45.995
to literally...
have a, um... uh...

14:46.064 --> 14:47.497
Stroke?

14:47.566 --> 14:50.455
Seriously?

14:50.575 --> 14:53.636
Well, you better hope I get all
this shit scanned before he wakes--

14:53.705 --> 14:56.139
What's that? I couldn't hear you
over the sound of--

14:56.208 --> 14:59.342
Seriously, just yoga?
He said, jealously.

14:59.411 --> 15:01.678
Oh, my God, if anybody's
jealous, it's you.

15:01.746 --> 15:04.314
Hang on, shut up,
I have something for this...

15:04.382 --> 15:06.783
Lana Cougar Mellencamp!
What?

15:06.851 --> 15:08.518
Look at him!
He's a child!

15:08.587 --> 15:10.820
He's 21! I think!

15:10.889 --> 15:13.890
Which is more than I can say
for most of your sexual partners!

15:13.959 --> 15:17.660
What? I-- that-- I mean, even if that were
technically true, it's--

15:17.729 --> 15:19.279
It's what, painfully obvious

15:19.364 --> 15:20.780
that the reason you try
to drag your dick

15:20.865 --> 15:21.998
through every attractive
woman you meet

15:22.067 --> 15:23.227
is because you're not over me?

15:23.235 --> 15:25.535
Oh, my God!

15:25.604 --> 15:28.705
And just when their anger
reaches a fever pitch,

15:28.773 --> 15:30.707
in walks Figgis.

15:30.775 --> 15:33.376
I can't even formulate
a response to that!

15:33.445 --> 15:35.211
Because you can't argue
with the truth!

15:35.280 --> 15:39.048
I can! And if anybody's
not over anybody, it's you!

15:39.117 --> 15:42.218
With your-- your--
your-- your-- your--

15:45.790 --> 15:46.856
Timing.

15:50.161 --> 15:53.429
Um, excuse me?
Hello?

15:56.686 --> 15:58.301
Jesus, my ear balls!

15:58.370 --> 16:00.036
Um...

16:00.105 --> 16:02.518
Oh.
So, here's the thing with that...

16:03.069 --> 16:05.475
I'll be seein' you two later...

16:05.543 --> 16:07.210
Guards!

16:07.279 --> 16:09.178
Gua--!

16:09.247 --> 16:10.680
So... not great.

16:10.749 --> 16:12.015
Uh, could be worse.

16:12.083 --> 16:13.383
Coming, Your Majesty!

16:13.451 --> 16:14.517
Case in point.

16:19.124 --> 16:21.624
Yeah, they are gonna
kill everybody.

16:21.693 --> 16:23.860
Well, dammit!
I'll have to disclose that!

16:23.928 --> 16:25.695
Will somebody do something?

16:25.764 --> 16:27.230
Yeah, Lana, get his pants off.

16:27.299 --> 16:28.898
Inappropes, honey.

16:28.967 --> 16:31.134
Wait, were they screwing?

16:31.202 --> 16:33.236
Hey! If anybody tells
mother about this, I'll--

16:33.305 --> 16:35.538
Wait, what?
What the shit?

16:35.607 --> 16:38.541
You idiots! What did you do?
Hey, whoa! First of all,

16:38.610 --> 16:41.444
your plan was way too complicated.
Maybe for you people!

16:41.513 --> 16:44.213
It had everything but a sign
for free bird seed,

16:44.333 --> 16:45.934
and second of all...

16:46.054 --> 16:47.648
[Gun clicks]
What the--?

16:47.768 --> 16:50.462
Huh. I was wondering how many rounds
this little guy held...

16:51.423 --> 16:52.789
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.

16:52.857 --> 16:54.057
I gotta get outta here!

16:54.125 --> 16:55.758
If they find out
the CIA was behind this,

16:55.827 --> 16:57.527
it'll be
an international incident!

16:57.595 --> 16:59.462
Yeah, God forbid
you guys get caught.

16:59.531 --> 17:01.731
Hello, front desk?
Watergate Hotel?

17:01.800 --> 17:03.900
This is the Bay of Pigs,
in room 61.

17:03.968 --> 17:06.602
Could you send up 1,500
poorly-trained Cuban exiles?

17:06.671 --> 17:07.869
Ooh, and ice!

17:07.939 --> 17:09.276
You done?

17:09.396 --> 17:11.122
Yes, that's right,
and a bucket of ice.

17:11.242 --> 17:14.410
Hmm? What's that? No, we won't
be needing any air cover.

17:14.479 --> 17:15.712
Click. Now I'm done.

17:19.483 --> 17:21.751
Then can we--
Carol, I'm assuming all the bedrooms

17:21.819 --> 17:23.319
are connected
to secret passages?

17:23.387 --> 17:25.755
Yeah, so that at night
grandfather could...

17:25.824 --> 17:27.190
look in on the children.

17:27.258 --> 17:29.692
Ew.

17:29.761 --> 17:32.028
Okay, everybody in,
and make sure you swing by

17:32.097 --> 17:33.963
and get Krieger and Ray
on your way out.

17:34.032 --> 17:35.531
Yeah, where is Ray?

17:41.940 --> 17:44.674
Well, I gotta hand it to you...

17:53.585 --> 17:54.817
Wait, what about you guys?

17:54.886 --> 17:55.818
Uh, we're going to...

17:55.887 --> 17:56.919
Um... uh...

17:56.988 --> 17:58.788
Beat 'em off--
hold them off,

17:58.857 --> 18:02.125
so you guys can get away, to--
Safety

18:02.193 --> 18:03.359
or wherever.

18:03.428 --> 18:05.379
Uh-huh.

18:08.499 --> 18:11.534
Okay, so obviously
we'll need to talk

18:11.603 --> 18:12.835
about what just happened,

18:12.904 --> 18:15.204
so... um...

18:15.273 --> 18:15.952
Shitter?

18:16.072 --> 18:18.274
Or wherever.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.277
Your Majesty!

18:21.346 --> 18:22.779
What in the...
Mother?

18:22.847 --> 18:24.380
Your Highness!
Your Majesty!

18:24.449 --> 18:26.916
You're alive!
Tear this place apart!

18:26.985 --> 18:29.352
And when we find
these American pigs,

18:29.420 --> 18:32.321
they will eat their own eyes
before we kill them!

18:32.390 --> 18:34.190
Oh, my God...

18:34.259 --> 18:36.726
Lana! It's like--
it's like

18:36.795 --> 18:39.162
the danger makes
it that much hotter!

18:39.230 --> 18:43.230
Yeah, yeah, that,
plus your dick!

18:45.320 --> 18:46.652
<i>Right?</i>

18:47.839 --> 18:49.105
Totally.

18:49.174 --> 18:50.740
<i>Oh, my God...</i>

18:51.828 --> 18:54.610
Well, I hope you're all pleased

18:54.662 --> 18:55.978
with yourselves...

18:56.047 --> 18:58.748
because thanks
to your latest fiasco,

18:58.817 --> 19:01.489
after he makes a formal
protest at the U.N. tomorrow,

19:01.609 --> 19:04.188
the Durhani ambassador is being recalled.

19:04.308 --> 19:06.582
Which...it was all Slater's fault.

19:06.702 --> 19:08.633
Sterling, I swear to God...

19:08.753 --> 19:12.195
Malory it was, he--
And why are you taking Sterling's side?

19:12.263 --> 19:13.496
Because...

19:13.565 --> 19:15.565
Shut up!
Burn!

19:15.633 --> 19:17.834
Slater's plan was just--
Fakakta!

19:17.902 --> 19:20.703
And I was counting on that commission,
and now the homeowners

19:20.772 --> 19:22.939
are taking the house
off the market.

19:23.007 --> 19:26.609
You do realize you're the homeowner.
Still though.

19:26.678 --> 19:28.878
Oh, shut up, and unless there's
anything else,

19:28.947 --> 19:30.346
you can all get out.

19:30.415 --> 19:32.415
Actually, there is one
other thing.

19:32.484 --> 19:34.116
What?

19:34.185 --> 19:36.545
I think Ray deserves a hand.

19:36.845 --> 19:39.265
[All laughing]

19:41.292 --> 19:43.493
God dammit!

19:43.561 --> 19:45.943
Oh, come on, we were
all thinking it...

19:46.292 --> 19:49.298
Cause you got no freaking hand, stupid!

19:49.418 --> 19:59.535
