18:31.810 --> 18:33.679
- [chuckling]

18:33.745 --> 18:36.148
I KNEW THIS GIANT BOTTLE
OF SYRUP COSTUME

18:36.215 --> 18:37.683
WOULD COME IN HANDY
ONE DAY.

18:37.749 --> 18:40.819
NOW TO WAIT FOR THE ELUSIVE
BREAKFAST TROLL TO SHOW UP,

18:40.886 --> 18:42.521
AND CATCH IT
WITH MY BUTTERFLY NET.

18:43.889 --> 18:44.990
[crowd swooning]

18:45.057 --> 18:46.458
- ARE YOU
THE NINJA PANCAKE MOM?

18:46.525 --> 18:48.126
- WHY, YES!

18:48.193 --> 18:50.696
- WILL YOU SIGN OUR PANCAKES?

18:53.665 --> 18:56.268
[all cheering]

18:56.335 --> 18:59.705
- NOW THAT I'M FAMOUS,
I'M BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.006
OOH!

19:01.073 --> 19:03.475
THERE'S THE PANCAKE BATTER.
- GOTCHA!

19:03.542 --> 19:05.043
YOUR MAGIC IS MINE!

19:05.110 --> 19:06.178
- [laughing]

19:06.245 --> 19:08.647
YOU MUST BE A DERANGED FAN.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.249
- WELL, YOU'RE HALF RIGHT.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.251
- GUYS, THIS IS AWESOME!

19:12.317 --> 19:14.920
MY MOM'S TOTALLY HAPPY
THANKS TO MY WISH.

19:14.987 --> 19:18.290
I FINALLY DID SOMETHING
THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BACKFIRE.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.759
- UH, TIMMY?

19:22.227 --> 19:25.063
- YOU COULDN'T GIVE ME
A SECOND TO ENJOY THAT.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.999
- WELCOME TO CROCKERTUBE!

19:27.065 --> 19:28.200
AS YOU CAN SEE,

19:28.267 --> 19:29.334
I'VE IMPRISONED
THIS BREAKFAST TROLL

19:29.401 --> 19:30.969
IN MY TROLL BOOTH.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.739
I'M GONNA ZAP HER WITH
10,000 VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY

19:33.805 --> 19:35.407
AND STEAL HER MAGIC.

19:35.474 --> 19:38.877
SLIGHT SIDE EFFECT,
YOU'LL BE COMPLETELY VAPORIZED!

19:38.944 --> 19:41.580
- WELL, THAT'S
THE PRICE OF FAME.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.949
I HEARD THE SAME THING
ALMOST HAPPENED

19:44.016 --> 19:47.019
TO TEENAGE SINGING SENSATION
CHIP SKYLARK.

19:47.085 --> 19:48.921
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

19:48.987 --> 19:50.856
- I KNOW.
WE GOTTA SAVE MY MOM.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.659
- NO, I MEAN,
I READ ALL THE FAN MAGAZINES

19:53.725 --> 19:56.361
AND NEVER KNEW CHIP SKYLARK
WAS A BREAKFAST TROLL.

19:56.428 --> 19:59.731
- [excited panting]

19:59.798 --> 20:03.101
NOTE TO SELF,
NO MORE BICYCLE-POWERED GADGETS.

20:03.168 --> 20:05.270
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
I'M GONNA ZAP THE TROLL

20:05.337 --> 20:07.005
AND HAVE BUNS OF STEEL!

20:07.072 --> 20:08.807
IT'S A WIN-WIN!

20:08.874 --> 20:11.109
- OH, NO!
THE METER'S RISING.

20:11.176 --> 20:14.046
GUYS, YOU GOTTA POOF MOM
OUT OF THERE.

20:14.112 --> 20:16.582
- AH! CROCKER MUST'VE
INSULATED HIS CAVE

20:16.648 --> 20:17.983
WITH BUTTERFLY NET.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.018
SO FAIRY MAGIC DOESN'T WORK.

20:20.085 --> 20:22.087
TIMMY, YOU'LL HAVE
TO GO IN THERE

20:22.154 --> 20:24.356
AND RESCUE YOUR MOM
YOURSELF.

20:24.423 --> 20:25.857
- WHAT! NO WAY!

20:25.924 --> 20:27.526
CROCKER WILL ANNIHILATE ME!

20:27.593 --> 20:29.294
AND GIVE ME AN "F" IN ENGLISH.

20:29.361 --> 20:32.698
- THEN I'LL HAVE TO COME UP
WITH ANOTHER PLAN.

20:32.764 --> 20:35.233
[yells]
MY PLAN WORKED!

20:35.300 --> 20:38.403
- YOU CAN DO IT, SPORT.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:38.470 --> 20:41.006
I CAN DO ANYTHING
I PUT MY MIND TO. YIKES!

20:41.073 --> 20:43.141
- I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU,
TURNER.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.310
THAT'S WHY I PUT IN
THIS BUNSEN BURNER.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.779
OR SHOULD I SAY...
BUNSEN <i> TURNER?</i>

20:47.846 --> 20:49.247
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

20:49.314 --> 20:50.916
- DAH! YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.085
I SHOULD'VE SAID TURNER BURNER.
OH, THAT'S NO GOOD EITHER.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.287
WOULD YOU MIND CHANGING
YOUR NAME TO TIMMY BUNSEN?

20:55.354 --> 20:56.855
OH, NEVER MIND!

20:56.922 --> 20:58.590
I'M JUST GONNA
DESTROY YOU ANYWAY.

20:58.657 --> 21:00.993
- STOP RIGHT THERE,
MR. CRAZY FAN.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.028
I MIGHT BE BETTER
THAN EVERYONE,

21:03.095 --> 21:05.697
BUT DON'T TAKE IT OUT
ON MY SON.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.065
HI-YAH!

21:07.132 --> 21:10.068
I'M GONNA GO ALL MAMA NINJA
ON YOUR HUMP!

21:12.571 --> 21:15.207
- SIC HER, GIRLFRIEND!

21:15.273 --> 21:17.342
NO, NO! DON'T <i> GET</i> SICK!

21:17.409 --> 21:19.878
AND HOW CAN YOU GET A FURBALL
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE FUR?

21:19.945 --> 21:22.080
- HI-YAH!

21:23.148 --> 21:24.516
- DOOH!

21:26.251 --> 21:28.754
- HI-YAH!

21:28.820 --> 21:30.222
HI-YAH!

21:30.288 --> 21:31.757
- THAT WAS AWESOME, MOM.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.325
- THANKS, TIMMY.

21:33.392 --> 21:36.461
NOW I HAVE TO GET TO THE STORE
BEFORE THIS COUPON EXPIRES.

21:36.528 --> 21:40.465
QUICK, LET'S TAKE THE BULLDOZER
THAT'S PARKED OUTSIDE.

21:40.532 --> 21:42.434
HI-YAH!

21:42.501 --> 21:43.935

21:44.002 --> 21:46.438
- OOPSY!

21:51.543 --> 21:53.712
- THANKS TO MR. CROCKER'S
WEIRD HAIRLESS CAT

21:53.779 --> 21:55.213
AND HER HIDDEN VIDEO CAMERA,

21:55.280 --> 21:58.216
THIS IS THE BIGGEST
VIRAL SENSATION EVER!

21:58.283 --> 22:01.586
- WELL, TIMMY, I'M DONE
WITH BEING AN INTERNET STAR.

22:03.555 --> 22:07.592
IF MY FAME PUTS YOU IN DANGER,
I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.729
YOUR HEALTH AND SAFETY
ARE MY TOP PRIORITY.

22:10.796 --> 22:12.431
HERE'S YOUR BREAKFAST.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.932
BAGELS WITH LOCKS.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.967
- MOM! THESE ARE PADLOCKS.

22:16.034 --> 22:17.502
OH, DEAR.

22:17.569 --> 22:21.406
I'VE REALLY GOTTA READ
THOSE RECIPES MORE CAREFULLY.

22:21.473 --> 22:22.974
- AHH! NO!

22:23.041 --> 22:24.509
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
LEAVE YOUR HOSPITAL.

22:24.576 --> 22:27.379
PLEASE! I LOVE YOUR PANCAKES!
AND YOUR BEDPAN!

22:27.446 --> 22:28.947
ALL OF YOUR PAN THINGS!
