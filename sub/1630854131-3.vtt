WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:05.039
-Do we have a problem?
-WALTER: He fell.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.874
-SUNNY: He fell?
-AMBER: Yep. That's him.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.542
He seemed interested
in Deadman's Drop.

00:08.576 --> 00:11.045
The decommissioned trail
off the Basin Trailhead?

00:11.079 --> 00:13.013
BEAU: What do we got here?
-Multiple sets of footprints.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.415
Somebody's water bottle.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.483
It looks like they've
been a lot of places.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.850
Kinda like our backpacker.

00:16.884 --> 00:19.187
-Tonya and Donno are criminals.
-I heard they went legit.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.523
Tonya worked for a drug cartel.
Legit, my ass!

00:22.556 --> 00:25.959
**

00:25.993 --> 00:28.496
-Paige?
-Hey. (chuckles)

00:28.529 --> 00:29.830
What are you doing
in Paige and Luke's tent?

00:29.863 --> 00:31.665
They all look alike.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.401
-Face it. We're lost.
-What about the money?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.803
The money won't mean a thing
if we die out here.

00:35.836 --> 00:36.870
Oh, my God. Relax.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.207
Good luck waiting for Mommy
to come find you.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.742
-Shut up!
-(gasping)

00:41.775 --> 00:44.612
(grunts) Touch me like that
again, I'll kill you.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.817
We didn't find
Paige and Luke last night.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.385
Why don't we all go out
and look for them, too?

00:51.419 --> 00:53.087
JENNY: Any progress
on the backpacker?

00:53.121 --> 00:54.988
Yeah.
And there's this old case --

00:55.022 --> 00:57.024
this girl found 20 years ago

00:57.057 --> 00:59.460
in the same place
with her heart cut out.

00:59.493 --> 01:02.830
I'm sorry. What?
Emily's up in those woods.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.433
**

01:07.101 --> 01:10.571
**

01:10.604 --> 01:14.342
**

01:14.375 --> 01:16.877
Emily? Hey!

01:18.078 --> 01:19.847
Stop!
Don't come any closer!

01:19.880 --> 01:24.552
**

01:24.585 --> 01:25.686
Come back!

01:27.555 --> 01:29.390
(breathing heavily)

01:29.423 --> 01:31.959
Wait!
I just want to talk!

01:31.992 --> 01:33.661
(breathing heavily)

01:33.694 --> 01:37.298
**

01:37.331 --> 01:38.666
(gasps)

01:38.699 --> 01:40.701
(panting)

01:40.734 --> 01:45.072
**

01:45.105 --> 01:47.208
(screams)
Let go of me!

01:47.241 --> 01:49.843
Easy, easy.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.512
You're okay. What happened?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.181
It was Luke.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.482
He's right behind me.
I saw blood.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.849
Okay, slow down.
I got ya.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.218
You're gonna be okay.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.352
Hey. Emily.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.890
-Easy, cowboy.
-Stay away from me!

02:02.923 --> 02:04.792
I was just trying to
find my way back to camp.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.327
I-I fell and cut my head.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.796
-Where's Paige?
-I don't know.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.664
-She's not with you?
-No.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.868
(winces)

02:14.902 --> 02:18.005
**

02:18.038 --> 02:19.072
You need to see
about those cuts,

02:19.106 --> 02:21.875
and then we can
figure this out.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.744
-Let's go.
-Okay.

02:23.777 --> 02:27.881
**

02:27.915 --> 02:32.220
**

02:32.253 --> 02:34.522
It's okay.
I'm right here with you.

02:34.555 --> 02:40.328
**

02:40.361 --> 02:46.066
**

02:46.099 --> 02:51.872
**

02:51.905 --> 02:57.911
**

02:57.945 --> 03:00.381
SUNNY: I totally understand
your frustration,

03:00.414 --> 03:01.915
but there's nothing more
we can do tonight.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.218
-Yes, there is. I can go.
-SUNNY: You can't do that.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.619
WOMAN:
Oh, my God, guys.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.458
Oh, my, G--
We've been worried sick!

03:10.491 --> 03:11.492
Are you okay?

03:11.525 --> 03:12.993
We need a first aid kit.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.228
First aid, pretty please.

03:14.262 --> 03:17.331
-Where's Paige?
-I don't know.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.866
What the hell ya mean,
you don't know?

03:18.899 --> 03:20.133
Hon, let him explain.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.403
At first, we sorta got lost

03:22.436 --> 03:25.639
and then we got into
a fight worse than usual,

03:25.673 --> 03:28.208
and she said
she wanted to go home.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.311
-That was the last I saw of her.
-Go home?

03:30.344 --> 03:31.979
Yeah, she said she never wanted
to see me again.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.914
How did you get those cuts?

03:33.947 --> 03:37.017
Well, after we fought,
we saw a light in the woods.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.487
Light? What, like a --
like a flashlight?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.889
Maybe?

03:41.922 --> 03:43.624
I thought it was someone
looking for us, but...

03:43.657 --> 03:45.659
Paige ran after it
and then I chased her,

03:45.693 --> 03:47.194
and I must have fell
and hit my head

03:47.227 --> 03:49.229
'cause it's all a bit hazy
after that.

03:49.263 --> 03:52.199
When I woke up she was gone,
and I had this.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.803
-Has anyone checked the tent?
-That's a good idea.

03:55.836 --> 03:56.837
I'll go do that right now.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.506
Get 'em some blankets, will ya?

04:03.010 --> 04:04.912
-Thank you.
-BUCK: She went home, huh?

04:04.945 --> 04:07.047
Just like that?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.750
Yeah, that's what she said.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.386
You know, when she makes up
her mind, it's...

04:12.420 --> 04:14.488
I can't believe she just
left you out there.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.690
Yeah.

04:16.724 --> 04:20.160
If Emily hadn't found me...

04:20.193 --> 04:22.229
You saved me.
Thank you.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.498
DOUG: That's pretty sweet
and all,

04:24.532 --> 04:27.901
but I'm having a hard time
piecing all this together.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.539
Well, he's not lying.
Paige's stuff is gone.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.674
She must have snuck in,
grabbed her things,

04:33.707 --> 04:35.409
and high-tailed it back to town.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.910
You think she's gonna
make it back okay?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.313
It's only a couple of miles
on clearly marked trails.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.915
Shoot, we walked that together
a couple of days ago.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.084
If she wanted to be gone,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.854
I mean, nobody's
a prisoner here.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.389
I'll call the ranger station,

04:48.422 --> 04:50.524
have them look for Paige
at the put-out.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.793
Well, I guess there's nothing
more we can do tonight

04:52.826 --> 04:54.962
except get a good night's sleep.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.530
Then we'll start over
in the morning.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.231
Ladies, would y'all please
take care of Luke?

04:58.265 --> 04:59.733
Take him back to his tent.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.736
Thank y'all very much.
Feel better.

05:02.770 --> 05:06.340
**

05:06.374 --> 05:10.411
**

05:10.444 --> 05:12.846
Something else you want
to tell me?

05:12.880 --> 05:15.483
Emily was pretty shook up.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.651
Well, of course she was,
the poor thing.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.354
Yeah, well, I'm gonna take
another look where I found him.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.390
All righty, then.
But you heard his story.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.992
I did.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.694
Just something I gotta do.

05:26.727 --> 05:30.564
**

05:30.598 --> 05:34.201
**

05:34.234 --> 05:37.538
(sighs)

05:37.571 --> 05:39.840
Oh, my gosh.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.042
What a day.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.644
(sighs)

05:43.677 --> 05:45.713
You think the kid's
telling the truth?

05:45.746 --> 05:47.381
You don't?

05:47.415 --> 05:49.683
Well, something just doesn't
sit right with me.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.685
Her stuff was gone,
you heard what he said.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.721
Well, how do we know
he didn't do something to her?

05:53.754 --> 05:57.190
N-Now, Buck, don't go there.

05:57.224 --> 06:01.429
(sighs) Last thing we need is
the guests up in a lather.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.900
We're gonna make sure
that girl is safe

06:06.934 --> 06:09.036
'cause that's what we do,
damn it.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.238
Well, I'm gonna
keep an eye on Luke.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.906
You do that.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.109
In the meantime,
make yourself useful, okay?

06:17.711 --> 06:18.879
All right.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.116
I sure hope he's
telling the truth.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.319
Me, too.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.155
**

06:35.663 --> 06:37.465
This is it.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.666
BEAU: Sure we don't
wanna call first?

06:38.699 --> 06:40.868
-(vehicle doors close)
-Neighbor said he saw a body.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.402
Yeah, no, I get that.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.371
I just wanna know
whose fence I'm hopping.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.739
The Mooney brothers,
Gil and Ivan.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.174
They used to own
half this valley.

06:47.207 --> 06:50.343
-Now just this.
-Okay, well, great.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.546
So can we go up to the house
and ask to look around?

06:52.580 --> 06:56.149
This is Montana, likely to meet
a rifle or a pack of dogs.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.085
Yeah, well, same in Texas,
but, you know,

06:58.118 --> 06:59.820
at least there
we still observe manners.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.989
We'll give you an iced tea and
then shoot you for trespassing.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.492
(chuckles)
Thank you.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.993
But hey, what do I know?

07:06.026 --> 07:07.628
You could always go back
to Houston.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.963
Ah. (laughs)
Kidding me?

07:09.997 --> 07:11.398
You'd miss me too much.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.734
I would?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.536
Yeah, I think deep down,
just a little bit.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.904
-Hm.
-Besides, I can't leave.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.572
I gotta stay here
for my daughter.

07:18.606 --> 07:22.510
Do you ever talk about
your daughter with Cassie?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.545
Okay, I see where
this is going.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.346
Let's just keep it professional,
Hoyt, for now

07:26.379 --> 07:28.381
and, uh, you know,
focus on the job.

07:28.415 --> 07:31.018
Finally found a way
to shut you up.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.686
Okay, no, no, no.
It's not that I don't
wanna talk about it.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.787
-Uh-huh.
-It's just that, you know,

07:33.821 --> 07:34.888
guys, we gotta have, uh...

07:34.922 --> 07:35.989
-Yep, yeah.
-...uh, boundaries.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.190
Boundaries. Keep digging.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.693
Whoa.

07:39.727 --> 07:45.332
**

07:45.365 --> 07:48.536
One dead body.
Happy Monday, Hoyt.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.971
(whistles)
Somebody caved his head in.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.006
Drag marks.
The body was moved.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.678
-Anything from the truck?
-(gunshots)

08:00.013 --> 08:01.749
I'd be in my rights
shooting you.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.551
You know I'm with the
Sheriff's Department, Mooney.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.686
Put the rifle down.
Let's talk about this.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.656
Still in my rights.
You're trespassing.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.824
-I told you so.
-Yeah, we should have called.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.492
Yeah, you are correct, sir.

08:12.526 --> 08:15.796
Listen, I'm gonna get up
nice and slow.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.997
We're gonna talk about this.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.031
This is not Texas.
He will shoot you.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.066
No, he won't.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.168
Nice and slow.
Here we go.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.235
Cover me.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.206
Get back down.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.708
No.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.877
-What?
-I said no.

08:29.910 --> 08:33.246
See, this is the part
where you put your weapon down,

08:33.280 --> 08:36.850
I'm gonna put mine away,
and we're gonna talk about this.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.852
This is my land!

08:38.886 --> 08:40.554
That body is my brother!

08:40.588 --> 08:41.855
It's Gil.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.657
Did you kill him?

08:43.691 --> 08:45.292
No.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.628
Easy, easy.
Hey, I had to ask.

08:47.661 --> 08:51.398
Okay, let's take this down
a few notches.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.033
Tell us what happened
with your brother.

08:53.066 --> 08:56.804
I told him to listen to me
and be careful, but did he?

08:56.837 --> 08:58.806
No. He did not.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.273
And now...

09:02.542 --> 09:04.544
He was just trying
to save the ranch.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.750
Lower your weapon, Ivan.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.551
Let's talk about this.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.520
**

09:13.553 --> 09:15.455
Come on, Ivan.

09:15.488 --> 09:19.727
**

09:19.760 --> 09:21.695
(sobbing)

09:21.729 --> 09:23.831
(sighs) Okay.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.635
(vehicle doors close)

09:27.668 --> 09:30.137
DENISE: So, how'd you find
the missing hiker's car?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.039
Fire Service contact.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.907
Her crew found it.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.508
Talk about a needle
in a haystack, right?

09:35.542 --> 09:36.977
Whoo-hoo.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.912
So...

09:38.946 --> 09:40.313
It's locked.

09:40.347 --> 09:43.283
I bet he has the keys
on the tire.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.491
Okay, let me see.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.193
Ah, got it.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.461
Well, then there's that, huh?

09:54.494 --> 09:56.830
Yep. Ha.

09:56.864 --> 10:02.903
**

10:02.936 --> 10:05.338
Look.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.174
It's Mark's trip itinerary.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.409
He has mileages

10:09.442 --> 10:11.544
and stops for supplies
all planned out.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.713
We can retrace his steps.

10:12.746 --> 10:17.350
**

10:17.384 --> 10:18.686
Preliminary
coroner's report said

10:18.719 --> 10:20.487
that he died
from a fall back --

10:20.520 --> 10:22.823
hit his head on a rock.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.457
You two fight, maybe?

10:24.491 --> 10:27.027
No. It was those gold mine
bastards.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.029
These bastards have a name?

10:29.062 --> 10:31.131
No, we got scammed.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.466
They were hawking off
a stockpile of unrefined gold,

10:33.500 --> 10:36.003
needed investors for a refinery.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.971
Gil was never great
with money,

10:38.005 --> 10:41.141
and after the flood,
we were gonna lose the ranch.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.143
They swindled us
and disappeared.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.745
So your brother
confronted them?

10:44.778 --> 10:46.914
I told him to let it go.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.315
But he wanted them dead.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.183
Lured them out to the ranch.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.451
They must have got to him first.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.953
What was the company called?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.654
Starlight Mining.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.958
**

10:57.991 --> 11:00.293
A husband and wife team?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.829
A blond woman?

11:01.862 --> 11:06.133
IVAN: No, it was just some guy
and his sidekick.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.803
**

11:09.837 --> 11:12.172
Can you help me?

11:12.205 --> 11:13.841
We'll certainly do
what we can.

11:13.874 --> 11:14.975
In the meantime,
we're just gonna need you

11:15.008 --> 11:16.576
to sit tight, okay?

11:16.609 --> 11:18.645
(sighs)

11:18.678 --> 11:20.380
I'll check his alibi.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.482
I need to look into
something.

11:22.515 --> 11:27.587
**

11:34.995 --> 11:37.397
Good morning.
How did you sleep?

11:37.430 --> 11:40.567
Um...okay.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.969
What are you working on?

11:42.002 --> 11:43.536
I'm not buying Luke's story.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.872
Why not?

11:44.905 --> 11:47.808
They had a fight, and she left.
(chuckles) Happens.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.076
So he gets completely lost,

11:49.109 --> 11:50.643
but Paige somehow finds
her way back to camp,

11:50.677 --> 11:52.880
packs all her bags
without anyone seeing her,

11:52.913 --> 11:54.081
and then hikes all the way
back to town?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.883
Well, it's not that farfetched
that she wanted to leave.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.184
I mean, he was a bit of an ass.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.186
You know, he keeps telling
everyone that I saved him,

11:59.219 --> 12:02.022
but when I saw him out there,
he didn't look saved.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.725
He just looked, I don't know,
like, scared or something.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.660
I don't know
what you saw, so...

12:07.694 --> 12:08.862
I saw you in their tent.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.698
Yes, and I told you
it was an honest mistake.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.901
All of these tents
look alike from the outside.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.669
Not everything is a mystery.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.140
Avery! Come on.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.809
It's not like there's
a million tents out there.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.510
You must have known that
that was Paige and Luke's.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.245
-Why were you really in there?
-I told you.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.716
Fine.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.352
But if you're hiding something,
I'm gonna find out.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.354
Where you off to?

12:34.387 --> 12:36.189
I lost my knife in the woods
last night,

12:36.223 --> 12:37.490
so I have to go look for it.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.859
No, no, you are not
wandering off on your own.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.193
That knife is very important
to me.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.528
I sleep with it
under my pillow.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.762
My father gave it to me.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.866
Look, Emily.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.035
I promised your mother
that I would look after you.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.972
Fine. (sighs)

12:52.005 --> 12:53.473
But I can look after myself.

12:53.506 --> 12:58.345
**

12:58.378 --> 13:03.183
**

13:06.854 --> 13:09.156
Hey, I, uh --
I cut Ivan loose.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.557
Turns out,
he was telling the truth.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.159
He wasn't there
when Gil was killed.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.194
He's still pretty upset, though.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.229
I would be, too.
He just lost his brother.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.998
-Mm-hmm.
-You guys got anything?

13:18.031 --> 13:19.299
Been looking into
Starlight Mining.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.700
We need to show you something.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.302
Yeah.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.404
Guy got arrested
three months ago in Idaho

13:24.437 --> 13:26.573
for aggravated assault,
name's Harold Gardiner.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.408
The witness statement
is eerily similar to Ivan's.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.643
Victim got fleeced
by a company called StarBright.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.479
Starlight, StarBright.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.981
Somebody's got a thing
for nursery rhymes.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.715
Okay, well, if this is our guy,
let's go get him.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.051
There's more.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.320
She was arrested with him.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.721
BEAU: Is this the woman you were
talking about earlier?

13:41.754 --> 13:43.190
You know her?

13:45.225 --> 13:47.294
She's my mother.

13:47.327 --> 13:51.198
**

13:54.434 --> 13:57.037
All right.
Yeah, thanks for checking.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.241
So (sighs) that was
the trading post.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.311
Apparently Mark had a resupply
package waiting for him.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.246
-Never picked it up.
-Hm. Well, get this.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.215
I just heard from Mark's family.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.951
They said that he e-mailed
them an update a few hours ago

14:10.984 --> 14:12.652
that he's in Logan's Pass.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.454
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.023
That his service is spotty,
that he misses them,

14:16.056 --> 14:17.390
and he'll see them soon.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.061
Logan's Pass puts him miles
off course.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.829
Yeah, well, maybe that's why
he skipped the trading post?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.032
Mm...
No, something doesn't fit.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.799
He e-mailed that from his phone?

14:26.833 --> 14:28.501
Yeah, his mom said
he's not an e-mailer,

14:28.535 --> 14:30.003
that he would have
called or texted.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.338
So she asked us to check it out.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.941
Doesn't make sense.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.314
(engine shuts off)

14:41.348 --> 14:42.882
So are we not gonna address
the fact that your mom

14:42.916 --> 14:44.351
is a career criminal?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.819
It's complicated.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.488
I bet.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.493
We haven't spoken in years.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.428
Last I heard, she was grifting
her way through Idaho.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.066
The gold mining scam
used to be her thing.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.501
Her and her sap of the month.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.537
So, when I heard that name,
I had a feeling.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.707
And you think she's involved
with Gil Mooney's murder?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.142
Murder would be a stretch,

15:09.176 --> 15:10.677
but her fingerprints
are all over the setup.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.345
And you're sure it's this motel?

15:13.680 --> 15:16.316
If she's in town.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.485
She has an arrangement
with the manager.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.087
Really?

15:22.322 --> 15:23.690
All right, so what's the plan?

15:23.723 --> 15:26.059
We talk to her,
see what she knows?

15:26.093 --> 15:27.460
Just don't let her charm you.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.861
You can't trust
anything she says.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.363
BEAU: All right.

15:30.397 --> 15:35.368
**

15:35.402 --> 15:40.373
**

15:40.407 --> 15:42.075
(door opens)

15:44.277 --> 15:45.545
Oh, Jenny.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.415
Hi, Mom.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.051
Let me get a good look at you.
Wha--

15:51.084 --> 15:52.352
-Oh.
-(door closes)

15:52.385 --> 15:54.154
Still wearing men's T-shirts,
I see.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.123
But just as beautiful as ever.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.457
Aww.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.359
No hug? All right.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.029
Oh, well.
How 'bout you? (chuckles)

16:02.062 --> 16:03.663
Sheriff Beau Arlen, ma'am.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.632
JENNY: I told you to keep
your grift out of Montana.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.467
I know you scammed
the Mooney brothers.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.169
Starlight Mining.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.737
It's clever how you change
the name --

16:10.770 --> 16:12.572
Light Star, StarBright.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.141
As much as I know that it would
bring you great joy

16:14.174 --> 16:16.643
to arrest me, I --

16:16.676 --> 16:18.345
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.747
Well, let me jog your memory.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.583
Gil Mooney. We found him
with his head bashed in.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.354
That's awful.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.156
We know you've been running this
gold mine scam out of Idaho

16:29.189 --> 16:30.957
with a man named
Harold Gardiner.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.460
(scoffs) Whoops.
You got me.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.395
But that's -- that's old news.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.398
That's fake news.
Whatever.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.267
Jenny, I'm on the straight
and narrow now.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.703
You always have been
a very good liar.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.240
-People can change.
-JENNY: So what,

16:47.274 --> 16:48.808
it's just a coincidence
that you show up

16:48.841 --> 16:50.243
at the same time as Harold?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.012
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.314
Yes, you are!

16:54.347 --> 16:55.915
You're doing that thing
with your hair.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.219
Why are you in town, Mom?

17:02.089 --> 17:04.324
Okay, I'm here to find Harold.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.027
-Told you. Oh, my God.
-And why is that?

17:08.061 --> 17:09.496
Because he stole from me.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.466
He took my life savings,
everything,

17:13.500 --> 17:15.068
after I showed him the ropes.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.736
The gold mining grift.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.505
Listen, a girl's gotta eat.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.140
Oh, my God.
She's still scamming people.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.841
Okay, time out.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.844
If Harold is here doing
this grift, as you call it,

17:24.877 --> 17:27.714
then would you know
where to find him?

17:27.747 --> 17:29.549
I might know where to look.

17:29.582 --> 17:33.019
Okay. Well, seems to me
like we have a mutual interest.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.455
-We sure do.
-No, no, no, no.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.889
I know what you're thinking.
I don't trust her.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.391
I don't trust you, either.

17:38.425 --> 17:42.061
But Mr. Sheriff here,
he's right.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.531
We want the same thing.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.799
Do you know
where Harold is or not?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.067
A simple question.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.337
If I did,
I'd have my money back.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.039
But what I can do
is narrow the search.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.474
What do you mean?

17:54.507 --> 17:57.510
Well, he'll be hunting
for his next mark,

17:57.544 --> 17:59.512
somebody desperate
for a quick payout.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.415
And we always looked
in the same places,

18:02.449 --> 18:05.051
but you're gonna have
to play his game.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.487
**

18:07.520 --> 18:09.489
We're gonna have to go
under cover.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.991
Which I hear you have
quite the talent for.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.526
(chuckles)

18:13.560 --> 18:15.128
(The McGuire Sisters'
"Sincerely" plays)

18:15.162 --> 18:19.532
**

18:19.566 --> 18:23.970
**

18:24.003 --> 18:28.741
* Sincerely

18:28.775 --> 18:34.447
* Oh, yes, sincerely

18:35.182 --> 18:37.016
-* 'Cause I love you
-(knock on door)

18:37.049 --> 18:39.352
* So dearly

18:41.221 --> 18:46.159
* Please say you'll be mine

18:46.193 --> 18:48.628
-Hi, Mama.
-Are you alone?

18:48.661 --> 18:49.962
Well, how else would I be?

18:49.996 --> 18:52.299
* Sincerely

18:52.332 --> 18:53.900
WALTER: You see?

18:53.933 --> 18:57.337
It's just me and my thoughts
and -- and my projects.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.907
I have a girl that's gone
missing from one of our trips.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.142
Have you seen her?

19:03.176 --> 19:06.646
Mama, please, please,
stop touching my things.

19:06.679 --> 19:11.284
**

19:11.318 --> 19:13.553
Do not do that again.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.054
Why?

19:15.087 --> 19:16.489
Are you gonna hit
your own mother?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.891
I'm all you've got, Walt.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.994
Now, have you seen this girl?

19:22.028 --> 19:23.796
No.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.366
**

19:26.399 --> 19:28.468
What, did something
happen to her?

19:28.501 --> 19:31.504
I don't know.
But if they come looking,

19:31.538 --> 19:33.039
it's not gonna be good
for both of us.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.107
-Do you understand that?
-Yes.

19:37.877 --> 19:42.582
Now (sighs) the backpacker
from Deadman's Drop,

19:42.615 --> 19:45.352
I need you to move him
far away from here

19:45.385 --> 19:47.554
so he will never be found.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.389
I didn't do anything.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.224
You should know
it doesn't matter.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.826
Haven't I always kept you safe?

19:53.860 --> 19:57.830
So you need to listen to me
and do as I say, okay?

19:59.866 --> 20:02.001
Just me and you, Walt.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.103
Just me and you.
Come here.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.874
That's a good boy.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.377
Do you love an apple?

20:10.410 --> 20:13.079
* Do you love a pear?

20:14.747 --> 20:18.318
* Do you love a laddy

20:18.351 --> 20:22.221
* With the golden brown hair?

20:22.255 --> 20:25.458
* Oh-oh, yes

20:25.492 --> 20:30.863
* I love him,
I'll never deny him *

20:30.897 --> 20:37.003
* I'm gonna love him
'till the day that I die *

20:40.873 --> 20:43.142
So, if I get
an early jump tomorrow,

20:43.175 --> 20:44.677
I could be home by nightfall.

20:44.711 --> 20:45.812
Are you sure
you want to come?

20:45.845 --> 20:47.246
DENISE: Well, I just don't want
you to be skulking

20:47.280 --> 20:48.515
around the woods
all by yourself.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.817
And besides, I could
really use the vitamin D.

20:50.850 --> 20:51.851
(door opens)

20:51.884 --> 20:53.653
-Oh.
-Hey-hey!

20:53.686 --> 20:56.989
Another dish.
Still cooking for a grown man.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.191
Another home-cooked home run.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.793
Pumpkin enchiladas.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.662
Sounds weird.
Totally worked.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.531
(chuckles)
Well, sweet and salty

21:04.564 --> 21:07.066
(clears throat) never fails.
(chuckles)

21:07.099 --> 21:08.801
Wow. Sh--

21:08.835 --> 21:10.002
Did she just call me salty?

21:11.338 --> 21:13.506
What, are you, uh, summiting?
What's happening?

21:13.540 --> 21:15.875
Uh, Denise and I are
hitting the trails

21:15.908 --> 21:17.644
at first light tomorrow.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.011
-We got a hunch.
-Well, I know how that goes.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.246
This that backpacker thing?

21:20.279 --> 21:22.081
Yeah. You wanna come?

21:22.114 --> 21:25.452
No, can't. Working a murder
at the Mooney Ranch.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.854
And Jenny's mom is involved.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.522
Wait. Gigi's back?

21:29.556 --> 21:31.123
Yeah, her name popped in a case.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.325
I guess she worked
with the suspect,

21:32.359 --> 21:36.028
so it's gonna be a fun
and slightly bumpy ride.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.730
Yeah. Is Jenny okay?

21:37.764 --> 21:39.566
Okay is not the word
I would use.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.000
Don't tell her
I said that, though,

21:41.033 --> 21:43.235
'cause...
you know how she gets.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.237
Yes, yes, I do.

21:46.373 --> 21:50.076
Listen, uh, my daughter
is camping in those woods.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.243
If you get up there
and you get some bad juju

21:51.277 --> 21:53.513
about this whole
backpacker thing,

21:53.546 --> 21:54.581
I want to be the first to know.

21:54.614 --> 21:58.050
Beau, of course.
It's probably nothing.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.554
Yeah, it's nothing
until it ain't.

22:03.523 --> 22:06.826
Just a little advice --
give her some space.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.795
You don't need
to go back up there.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.597
Okay. All right.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.699
You're a peach.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.702
-Bye.
-You guys be careful.

Did you just put butter
in your coffee?

22:34.387 --> 22:37.356
Oh, you caught me.
(laughs)

22:37.390 --> 22:40.059
It's my little secret
to a lasting energy.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.361
-Waistline be damned.
-Right.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.063
What can I do for you,
sweetheart?

22:44.096 --> 22:46.699
Uh, I wanted to ask if I could
maybe use your SAT phone.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.901
'Cause I still don't have
any service,

22:48.935 --> 22:50.470
and I want to call my dad.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.638
What for, hon?

22:51.671 --> 22:53.673
I just thought that he could
maybe check in on Paige,

22:53.706 --> 22:55.842
just, like, make sure
that she actually got home okay.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.410
You don't need to worry your dad
about that.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.311
I got the rangers on it.

22:59.345 --> 23:03.182
Plus, I've offered her a full
refund for all her troubles.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.217
But to leave like that...

23:05.251 --> 23:08.655
I don't know.
Isn't that, like, strange?

23:08.688 --> 23:11.290
(spoon clinks)

23:11.323 --> 23:12.692
You know, people come here

23:12.725 --> 23:15.628
for all different
kinds of reasons.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.196
Some to leave
their past behind,

23:17.229 --> 23:20.332
and others to fix
their problems,

23:20.366 --> 23:22.669
and some to find a new life.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.904
Now, you can quote me on that
in your podcast if you want to.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.338
-(chuckles)
-Okay.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.407
That's enough doom and gloom.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.743
Everything's gonna be
just dandy, okay?

23:30.777 --> 23:32.044
-Okay.
-Okay.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.580
-All right.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.206
(sighs) What are you
doing here, Mom?

24:00.239 --> 24:01.841
I brought a peace offering.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.177
I'm making you dump cake.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.579
Pineapple.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.414
Your favorite.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.116
Come on.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.552
It's the best I can do.

24:12.585 --> 24:13.786
I already ate.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.555
Look, I could go,

24:15.588 --> 24:18.958
or you could let me
make this stupid cake for you

24:18.991 --> 24:22.361
and wipe the slate clean.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.664
Just for tonight.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.868
How would we do that?

24:30.570 --> 24:33.305
-You got any wine?
-Nope.

(laughs) Yeah, but --
but good disgusting.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.630
Truth is, I don't think it was
ever really your favorite.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.633
I just convinced you it was,
because I didn't have the money

25:00.667 --> 25:02.301
to buy you
a fancy birthday cake,

25:02.334 --> 25:04.871
and -- and I wanted you to feel

25:04.904 --> 25:07.406
like you were getting
something special.

25:07.439 --> 25:08.808
Can we please not talk
about this?

25:08.841 --> 25:12.879
Why not?
It wasn't all bad.

25:12.912 --> 25:16.616
Remember our last road trip
to Vegas before Daddy left?

25:16.649 --> 25:20.486
And I spent all our
traveler's checks on roulette.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.488
And I thought
he was gonna kill me.

25:22.521 --> 25:26.993
And you -- you won it
all back for us.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.328
My good luck charm.

25:29.361 --> 25:33.032
* Ever had was all we need

25:33.065 --> 25:34.500
Why did you come back?

25:34.533 --> 25:36.636
* Of homegrown food
and family *

25:36.669 --> 25:38.504
Because Harold stole
from me, Jenny.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.008
The money?

25:42.041 --> 25:43.710
That's it?

25:44.677 --> 25:46.579
That's the only reason
you came back here?

25:46.613 --> 25:48.014
Well, you know the saying --

25:48.047 --> 25:50.282
hell hath no fury
like a woman scorched.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.153
Scorned, Mom. Scorned.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.388
* You felt so warm

25:56.422 --> 25:57.323
Whatever.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.160
Well, I guess
I can't blame you.

26:02.494 --> 26:07.066
Speaking of scorched,
any news on Harold?

26:07.099 --> 26:09.301
Yeah.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.805

for StarNight Mining

26:12.839 --> 26:14.206

26:17.043 --> 26:19.946
-Think it's him?
-I know it is.

26:22.548 --> 26:24.216
It's him.

a greet tomorrow.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.354

26:28.387 --> 26:29.989
Just be careful, Jenny.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.160
That's rich,
coming from you, Mom.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.967
-What's in this for you?
-I told you.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.601
Revenge.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.939
And -- And helping
my daughter.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.511

with that cute sheriff.

I like them pretty and young.

26:55.581 --> 26:59.886
-Mm.
-Keeps a pep in my step.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.220
He's not that cute.

27:04.323 --> 27:07.459
$30,000 cash,
compliments of the county.

27:07.493 --> 27:10.629
Which one of you
is gonna sign for this?

27:10.663 --> 27:14.000
Anything happens to this,
it's a lot of paychecks.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.002
Okay, so why do we need
this cash?

27:16.035 --> 27:17.670
Because Harold would demand
to see it.

27:17.704 --> 27:18.871
She's right.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.908
As soon as we lure him out,
we're slapping cuffs on him.

27:22.909 --> 27:25.812
Honey and vinegar, Hoyt.
Honey and vinegar.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.579
We get him talking,
we trick him into a confession.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.648
It's gonna be easier if he feels
like he's in control.

27:29.682 --> 27:31.450
It's the cash.
I get it.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.819
What do you wanna do? Do you
wanna get into character, or...

27:34.653 --> 27:36.055
Sure.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.458
-We're married.
-What?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.360
JENNY: We're excited about
the investment opportunity.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.162
We get him talking,
he takes the cash,

27:43.195 --> 27:44.396
and it's a takedown,
nice and clean.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.564
Let's get you changed
and wired up.

27:45.597 --> 27:46.799

to back you up.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.001
All right.

27:49.035 --> 27:51.237
Don't forget to smile,
Jenny Bear.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.404
It tricks your body
into thinking

27:52.438 --> 27:55.074
that you're a happy person.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.676
Nice, Mom.
Thank you for helping.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.846
Well, you can thank me
by taking him down.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.882
-All right, let's do it.
-Yep.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.650

30:06.238 --> 30:08.908
I've got a stockpile
of unrefined gold

30:08.941 --> 30:10.076
that's not doing any good

30:10.109 --> 30:11.844
to anyone
just sitting in barrels.

30:11.878 --> 30:14.546
Your investment here
is gonna fund the refinery

30:14.580 --> 30:16.348
that brings it all to life,

30:16.382 --> 30:18.885
and you two are looking
at a 10% stake.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.386
-Oh!
-(whistles)

30:20.419 --> 30:22.788
-Wow.
-That is so exciting.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.891
We are trying to build
our nest egg.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.326
BEAU: Ah, you know, the wedding
kinda tapped us out a bit.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.061
You have any idea
what a life-sized ice sculpture

30:29.095 --> 30:30.629
of George Strait
costs these days?

30:30.662 --> 30:33.665
-My Lord and stars.
-Gosh golly, so expensive.

30:33.699 --> 30:35.201
I can imagine.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.536
BEAU: Well, we are just excited
as hell to have the opportunity,

30:37.569 --> 30:39.638
'cause we can imagine how many
other interested parties

30:39.671 --> 30:40.806
there are to a deal like this.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.341
You can say that again.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.743
Any of them give you
any trouble?

30:44.776 --> 30:46.545
Trouble? In what way?

30:46.578 --> 30:48.114
Oh, I don't know.

30:48.147 --> 30:51.183
Uh, any pushback
on any of the terms?

30:51.217 --> 30:53.185
Plenty of shady characters
out there, am I right?

30:54.320 --> 30:55.988
No. N-Not
that I can think of.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.856
So, a lot of happy campers,
then?

30:57.890 --> 30:59.158
A lot of happy campers.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.327
-Great.
-Great. (chuckles)

31:01.360 --> 31:03.996
I forget. H-How did
you two find me again?

31:04.030 --> 31:06.198
-Facebook friend.
-Casino.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.866
(both laugh)

31:07.900 --> 31:09.668
JENNY: Honey. (laughs)

31:10.903 --> 31:12.905
-Who's right?
-Both of us, actually.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.907
See, her -- her --
her friend from Facebook

31:14.941 --> 31:16.808
had a birthday party
at Lucky LuAnn's casino.

31:16.842 --> 31:18.344
At Lucky LuAnn's casino.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.147
It was -- It was a night
that I will never remember.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.781
Oh! I will never forget.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.316
(both laugh)

31:29.821 --> 31:33.625
DENISE: Well, I'm just saying --
why would someone in distress

31:33.659 --> 31:36.128
send a selfie to their parents?

31:36.162 --> 31:37.496
It just doesn't
make any sense.

31:37.529 --> 31:38.830
I know.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.333
None of it makes sense.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.169
(sighs) I hope we figure
something out.

31:43.202 --> 31:44.236
Yeah.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.638
Me, too.

31:46.672 --> 31:49.208
**

31:49.241 --> 31:50.842
Looks like this guy
needs some help.

31:50.876 --> 31:51.877
DENISE: Uh-huh.

31:51.910 --> 31:57.616
**

31:57.649 --> 32:03.222
**

32:03.255 --> 32:05.057
Hey.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.525
Engine trouble?

32:06.558 --> 32:09.861
Um, yeah.

32:09.895 --> 32:11.297
I-I got it handled.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.499
Mm, doesn't look like it.
I can give you a hand.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.201
No.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.902
(clears throat)
I mean, thank you,

32:16.935 --> 32:19.505
but, uh, I can handle it.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.209
You been hiking?
You're pretty mucked up.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.576
-That's a lot of mud.
-Sure.

32:26.745 --> 32:27.980
It's really smoking.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.948
I'm good with cars.
Let me just help you.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.183
I said I can handle it.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.554
Okay.

32:35.587 --> 32:39.525
**

32:39.558 --> 32:43.996
**

32:44.030 --> 32:44.963
What's in the truck?

32:44.997 --> 32:48.534
Yo, Cass!
You okay?

32:48.567 --> 32:51.403
Yeah.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.572
Okay, well, I think
we should get going.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.740
Okay.

32:56.608 --> 32:57.576
Have a nice day.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.612
Yeah, you, too.

33:00.646 --> 33:04.616
**

33:04.650 --> 33:08.220
**

33:15.594 --> 33:17.396
Here. I got you.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.231
Thanks.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.366
Wouldn't want you
to get hurt again.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.237
You look like a natural
out here.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.373
Although, you'd probably
look great doing anything.

33:27.406 --> 33:28.840
(chuckles)

33:28.874 --> 33:30.742
-You seeing that, too?
-So gross.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.578
DOUG: He works fast,
I'll give him that.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.881
-Paige just barely left camp.
-Yeah, if she left camp.

33:37.483 --> 33:39.451
Just -- never mind.
I know that that sounds crazy.

33:39.485 --> 33:42.288
I don't think it sounds
so crazy.

33:42.321 --> 33:45.057
I don't trust Luke.
He seems shifty.

33:45.091 --> 33:47.459
He is, right? Because nobody
is listening to me.

33:47.493 --> 33:48.760
Hey. What are you guys
talking about?

33:50.262 --> 33:53.031
-Nothing.
-Doesn't seem like nothing.

33:53.065 --> 33:54.966
Just making conversation,
that's all.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.571
Hmm. Well, maybe you should just
focus on the horses, yes?

33:59.605 --> 34:02.007
-Avery.
-What?

34:02.040 --> 34:04.143
It's cool. Relax.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.744
See you on the trail horses.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.350
Are you kidding me?

34:11.383 --> 34:12.651
What, I can't talk
to people now?

34:12.684 --> 34:14.886
No. Wait, wait.
P-Please, wait. Just -- just...

34:14.920 --> 34:18.857
Please, let's just --
let's just reset.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.627
Sorry if I upset you, but if
something's important to you,

34:21.660 --> 34:22.794
then it's important to me.

34:22.828 --> 34:24.730
What does that mean?

34:24.763 --> 34:26.565
First and foremost,
we find your father's knife.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.135
**

34:29.168 --> 34:31.303
And Paige?

34:31.337 --> 34:32.538
Uh, well, if that's still
bugging you,

34:32.571 --> 34:34.573
then, uh, we get to
the bottom of that, too.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.075
**

34:37.109 --> 34:38.544
You and me.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.080
Okay.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.483
Okay.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.018
**

34:47.052 --> 34:49.721
$26,000, $28,000.
$30,000.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.890
(chuckles)
Looks like we're good to go.

34:51.923 --> 34:54.293
The money's all here.
Contracts are signed.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.196
You two are officially
investors.

34:57.229 --> 35:00.232
Well, this is fantastic.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.667
There is just one more thing.

35:01.700 --> 35:02.801
What's that?

35:02.834 --> 35:04.570
You're under arrest.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.704
BEAU: Hey!

35:05.737 --> 35:08.540
(both grunting)

35:08.574 --> 35:09.541
Ohh!

35:09.575 --> 35:11.177
(grunts)

35:13.078 --> 35:14.946
(grunts)

**

35:21.019 --> 35:24.890
Easy, big boy.
I told you I'd get ya.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.592
-We're good?
-Yeah, we're good.

35:28.994 --> 35:32.298

-Aah!

35:32.331 --> 35:35.834

Stop!

JENNY:
Harold! Stop!

36:11.169 --> 36:12.338
HAROLD:
I can't go back to jail.

He has to pay for this!

You've got nowhere else to go!

Ow!

Oh, ow.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.891
**

36:32.924 --> 36:34.826
Listen to me, he will pay.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.628
Hey! You want to go to jail
for the rest of your life

36:36.662 --> 36:38.297
for this bastard, huh?

36:38.330 --> 36:40.466
You think your brother
would want that?

36:40.499 --> 36:43.034
Trust me,
Gil does not want that.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.037
Okay?

36:47.606 --> 36:50.676
Okay. Okay.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.545
Nowhere for you to run now.
It's over.

36:55.481 --> 36:58.684
I kept trying to figure out
where I knew you from.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.553
Now I know.
You're her daughter.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.721
Gigi put you up to this,
didn't she?

37:02.754 --> 37:04.122
Save your breath.

37:04.155 --> 37:06.725
(laughs)

37:06.758 --> 37:09.628
What's so funny?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.530
Gigi always comes out on top,
doesn't she?

37:11.563 --> 37:15.501
**

37:15.534 --> 37:17.168
Hey.

37:17.202 --> 37:19.104
You can't just leave me here!

37:20.739 --> 37:23.141
No, no, no, no!

37:23.174 --> 37:25.110
No! Damn!

37:26.978 --> 37:28.447
Whoa!
What happened?

37:28.480 --> 37:29.381
The money's gone.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.150
Wait, what? How?

37:32.183 --> 37:34.853
My mother.

37:34.886 --> 37:35.654
She played us.

37:35.687 --> 37:40.091

37:50.936 --> 37:53.271
Oh, Hoyt, I'm so sorry.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.707
I can't believe
I let this happen.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.043
Don't worry.
We'll find her.

37:58.076 --> 38:00.879
**

38:00.912 --> 38:03.782
She's gone.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.551
She hasn't changed.

(wood thuds)

38:16.728 --> 38:18.129
Hey, Mama.

38:18.163 --> 38:19.898
I assume it's handled.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.633
It is.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.201
(sighs) Good.

38:23.234 --> 38:24.570
Sort of.

38:24.603 --> 38:29.007
**

38:29.040 --> 38:30.409
What do you mean, sort of?

38:30.442 --> 38:31.510
I was careful, I promise.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.679
What happened?

38:35.246 --> 38:38.484
Someone saw me.
I was gonna take care of her,

38:38.517 --> 38:39.317
too, but someone else
was in the car --

38:39.351 --> 38:40.652
Who was it?
Who saw you?

38:40.686 --> 38:41.687
Her friend called her Cassie.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.691
(sighs)

38:45.724 --> 38:50.228
**

38:50.261 --> 38:53.031
You are
such a disappointment.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.701
You have to do better.

38:55.734 --> 39:01.873
**

39:01.907 --> 39:03.675
There it is.

39:03.709 --> 39:07.746
Yep. This is the exact location
Mark e-mailed his selfie from.

39:09.548 --> 39:10.682
(camera shutter clicks)

39:11.550 --> 39:12.951
Okay.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.620
What do you think?

39:14.653 --> 39:16.822
Think that matches Mark's
perspective, right?

39:16.855 --> 39:18.156
Looks right to me.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.027
Hold on.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.662
Look at the mountains.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.464
Wait a minute.

39:25.497 --> 39:28.066
Mark's photo has snow
on the peaks.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.868
Right, but there isn't any.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.170
DENISE: Wait, so did it
all just melt overnight?

39:33.271 --> 39:35.874
Exactly.
That would take weeks.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.175
There's no way he was here.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.611
Okay, so then why would he send
an old picture to his parents?

39:39.645 --> 39:40.679
He wouldn't.

39:40.712 --> 39:41.880
So, if he didn't, then who did?

39:41.913 --> 39:43.314
-And why?
-Right.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.118
-We need to find him.
-Yeah.
