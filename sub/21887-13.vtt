00:00.234 --> 00:02.601
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

00:02.796 --> 00:05.483
I'm arresting you
for the murder of the boy you blew up

00:05.508 --> 00:06.882
under the Crown Point Bridge.

00:06.914 --> 00:09.282
And how can <i>you</i> help me?

00:09.317 --> 00:12.264
What do you say, pal? Give me a smile.

00:13.801 --> 00:15.400
I'm not who my parents might've

00:15.436 --> 00:17.336
wanted me to be, and I'm okay with that.

00:17.371 --> 00:18.770
I'm not okay with it.

00:18.806 --> 00:20.272
I went to my lawyer and him draw up

00:20.307 --> 00:21.620
emancipation papers.

00:21.709 --> 00:22.841
Alfred, you're fired.

00:22.876 --> 00:24.543
Now get the hell out of my house.

00:24.578 --> 00:26.278
I am in control!

00:26.313 --> 00:27.679
But why would you want that?

00:27.715 --> 00:29.748
We had so much fun when we were me.

00:30.985 --> 00:32.951
Surprise.

00:32.987 --> 00:34.720
I needed the police to turn on Penguin.

00:34.755 --> 00:37.122
So you sent this monster to my city.

00:40.294 --> 00:42.127
I need you at the head of the GCPD.

00:42.162 --> 00:43.695
Let them think you're a hero.

00:43.731 --> 00:45.297
This is Gordon.

00:45.332 --> 00:47.966
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

00:48.002 --> 00:49.101
Ivy?

00:51.171 --> 00:52.971
What happened to you?

00:53.007 --> 00:54.273
I've been reborn.

00:56.844 --> 00:57.876
And I will never

00:57.911 --> 00:59.478
be underestimated or ignored

00:59.513 --> 01:00.612
ever again.

01:00.648 --> 01:03.181
Let's make Gotham our bitch.

01:21.570 --> 01:23.236
Can I help you?

01:28.777 --> 01:31.663
You're so beautiful.

01:31.780 --> 01:34.748
Thanks. Now move.

01:37.953 --> 01:39.412
Hey, Dad, let me tell you
what happened at school.

01:39.459 --> 01:40.551
Oh, my God, you're gonna love this.

01:40.576 --> 01:42.021
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I just tell him, please?

01:42.057 --> 01:43.123
Wait, no, can I tell him?

01:43.158 --> 01:44.190
- Just let me tell him.
- Nice score.

01:44.226 --> 01:46.626
Cindy? Who are these...

01:50.932 --> 01:52.929
Well,

01:53.101 --> 01:55.935
what a charming young lady.

01:55.971 --> 01:57.404
She's so beautiful, Mom.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.009
And cool.

01:59.072 --> 02:03.367
So your perfume turns people
into your superfans?

02:03.404 --> 02:05.170
Like all good things, it'll fade.

02:05.213 --> 02:06.212
But until then,

02:06.248 --> 02:07.447
they're mine.

02:08.417 --> 02:09.883
Freeze.

02:24.674 --> 02:26.307
Not bad.

02:26.709 --> 02:28.635
I'll check out the rest of the house.

02:36.912 --> 02:40.079
My friend thinks we're here to rob you,

02:40.115 --> 02:44.017
but I know who you work for,
Roland Charles, PhD.

02:47.656 --> 02:51.925
How you... torture plants

02:51.960 --> 02:54.407
in the name of science.

03:05.807 --> 03:07.273
Do you ever wonder

03:07.309 --> 03:08.608
how those plants feel?

03:11.680 --> 03:15.837
Soon, you'll share more with them...

03:16.159 --> 03:19.894
...than you ever could've imagined.

03:36.499 --> 03:39.171
What did you do to him?

03:39.674 --> 03:41.674
I gave him what he deserves.

04:03.565 --> 04:06.299
Captain. Captain Gordon.

04:06.334 --> 04:07.700
Yoo-hoo!

04:07.736 --> 04:10.336
Captain. Captain Gordon.

04:10.372 --> 04:13.373
- Chaz Carmichael.
- Congratulations.

04:13.408 --> 04:15.174
Boss ain't gonna be happy I'm in here.

04:15.210 --> 04:16.843
Let's say I got a lot of responsibility

04:16.878 --> 04:18.105
in my organization.

04:18.149 --> 04:20.317
Yeah, you seem like
a real responsible guy.

04:20.415 --> 04:23.426
My boss is Sofia Falcone.

04:28.456 --> 04:30.707
Oh, yeah? What's that got to do with me?

04:30.754 --> 04:31.871
Easy.

04:31.949 --> 04:33.973
All I know is she told me
if I ever got pinched,

04:34.059 --> 04:35.528
to tell you to give her a call.

04:37.552 --> 04:38.851
- Is that so?
- You can't do this.

04:38.876 --> 04:39.899
I got rights.

04:39.935 --> 04:40.967
Oh, yeah? How about you exercise

04:41.002 --> 04:42.955
your right to remain silent.

04:43.206 --> 04:45.340
Hey, Cap.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.106
Got something.

04:47.142 --> 04:49.208
Victim was Roland Charles.

04:49.244 --> 04:51.800
Ran R&D, Wayne Enterprises, Biotech.

04:51.847 --> 04:53.546
Did you know him from
when you worked at Wayne?

04:53.582 --> 04:55.014
I'd met him in passing.

04:55.050 --> 04:56.549
Not that I recognized him right away.

04:58.860 --> 05:01.221
It's like the tweaker
we found last week.

05:01.623 --> 05:03.957
The toxin entered the bloodstream
through the cuts on the neck.

05:03.992 --> 05:05.858
If it is the same as the last victim,

05:05.894 --> 05:07.602
the toxin creates vines that feed off of

05:07.649 --> 05:09.682
the victim's body, while also
attacking the hippocampus,

05:09.717 --> 05:12.477
like some plant-based psychedelics.

05:12.502 --> 05:14.654
So it kills you
and makes you hallucinate.

05:15.863 --> 05:17.698
Any witnesses?

05:17.792 --> 05:19.659
The family's saying
that it was two women,

05:19.694 --> 05:21.661
a redhead and a brunette.
The redhead used

05:21.696 --> 05:23.362
some kind of hypnosis on them,

05:23.398 --> 05:25.097
and the brunette wore a leather whip.

05:25.133 --> 05:27.033
Selina Kyle?

05:27.068 --> 05:30.436
Murder's not really her thing.
The family says

05:30.471 --> 05:32.089
the redhead killed Roland.

05:32.144 --> 05:33.305
She left with his briefcase.

05:34.191 --> 05:36.335
Well, if his briefcase is missing,

05:36.360 --> 05:38.860
maybe this is related
to his work at Wayne Biotech?

05:38.885 --> 05:39.799
Doubtful.

05:39.824 --> 05:44.251
He oversaw standard projects:
pharmaceuticals, pesticides...

05:45.618 --> 05:48.087
- What?
- Nothing.

05:49.321 --> 05:51.357
I'll track down Selina.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.200
<i>This is Bruce. Leave a message.</i>

06:02.410 --> 06:04.537
Bruce, I know we
haven't talked in a while,

06:04.572 --> 06:07.216
but someone just killed Roland Charles.

06:07.537 --> 06:09.482
We may have a problem.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.648
Roland Charles asked for clearance

06:15.683 --> 06:19.051
for some top secret biotech experiment.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.020
Project M.

06:21.055 --> 06:23.022
Ivy, you think I care about that?

06:23.057 --> 06:26.759
You just killed a man
in front of his family.

06:27.003 --> 06:29.662
He had it coming. You have no idea

06:29.697 --> 06:31.230
what these people do.

06:33.524 --> 06:36.626
We need to find out everything
we can about Project M.

06:37.310 --> 06:38.776
And whatever it is,

06:38.822 --> 06:41.407
all access would have
had to have been approved

06:41.442 --> 06:44.778
- by Bruce Wayne.
- You know, I-I-I really thought

06:44.946 --> 06:48.047
that doing a crime spree
with you would be fun,

06:48.082 --> 06:50.971
but... I was wrong.

06:51.219 --> 06:52.351
Selina!

06:52.386 --> 06:53.953
Leave me alone.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.089
Enjoy your shrubs.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.600
We don't need her.

07:11.405 --> 07:14.640
Now let's show everyone
just how strong we are.

07:25.719 --> 07:29.539
Pour me another shot.
Pour me another shot.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.060
Party time.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.429
Party time.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.524
Shut up.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.802
Gonna throw up. Gonna throw up.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.804
You know, I've had some crazy nights,

07:44.839 --> 07:47.273
but I've never bought a talking bird.

07:48.976 --> 07:51.222
Sorry. Party's over.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.812
I wasn't at the party.

07:55.817 --> 07:58.083
I've seen you before.

07:58.119 --> 08:00.886
At The Sirens. What are you...
What are you doing here?

08:04.292 --> 08:06.959
I'm here to speak for those

08:06.994 --> 08:08.759
who can't speak for themselves, Bruce.

08:08.816 --> 08:12.651
I'm here to speak for the plants.

08:12.733 --> 08:15.000
Okay.

08:15.788 --> 08:17.469
My head hurts.

08:17.757 --> 08:19.913
Please get out.

08:24.345 --> 08:26.097
First...

08:26.547 --> 08:28.761
tell me about Project M.

08:31.768 --> 08:33.118
How do you know about that?

08:33.154 --> 08:36.660
Oh, I know a lot of things...

08:37.225 --> 08:39.191
Billionaire Boy.

08:39.849 --> 08:41.527
Ivy?

08:47.668 --> 08:49.887
You're so...

08:50.538 --> 08:52.176
beautiful.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.073
Now, Project M.

09:02.116 --> 09:03.887
Next.

09:14.768 --> 09:16.528
Hey, there.

09:17.338 --> 09:18.660
Get him off...

09:33.614 --> 09:35.576
Is this seat taken?

09:35.662 --> 09:37.449
If I say yes, will it make a difference?

09:37.485 --> 09:39.551
You know, I've always been a fan.

09:39.587 --> 09:41.253
When you got locked up

09:41.289 --> 09:43.756
in this loony bin,
I expected great things.

09:43.791 --> 09:47.295
A murder or two, maybe a...

09:47.587 --> 09:49.154
prison break.

09:49.931 --> 09:54.633
But all you've done is mope
for the last six weeks.

09:58.434 --> 09:59.872
You must know, I cannot escape.

09:59.907 --> 10:01.240
Why?

10:02.343 --> 10:04.642
None of your business.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.337
Because Sofia Falcone is holding
someone important to me captive,

10:10.384 --> 10:11.978
and if I escape, she will kill him.

10:12.017 --> 10:15.587
Wow, what a boring story.

10:15.623 --> 10:16.922
If there's one thing

10:16.958 --> 10:20.299
I can't stand, it's someone boring.

10:22.096 --> 10:25.345
The last person
who bored me was Dietrich.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.433
I had to sneak into his

10:27.468 --> 10:30.736
shock therapy session
and goose the juice.

10:30.771 --> 10:32.071
Now he pees himself

10:32.106 --> 10:33.996
ten times a day, and sometimes, uh...

10:36.889 --> 10:39.290
...poos himself.

10:42.979 --> 10:45.182
Well, that's very sad.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.453
I'm gonna cure you
of this attitude, Oswald.

10:55.830 --> 10:59.999
I'm gonna find that entertaining
guy I know is inside of you.

11:00.470 --> 11:01.881
And when I do,

11:01.969 --> 11:03.435
ooh,

11:03.764 --> 11:07.606
we are gonna have so much fun together.

11:13.347 --> 11:15.848
That's quite a story.

11:17.091 --> 11:19.658
Not what I was expecting.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.487
You're just so easy to talk to.

11:24.658 --> 11:25.991
Normally, I would make this quick,

11:26.027 --> 11:27.359
like I did with Roland,

11:27.395 --> 11:29.695
but it's your name on the company

11:29.730 --> 11:31.630
that murders my little green friends.

11:32.026 --> 11:34.768
I'm so sorry, Ivy.

11:35.269 --> 11:37.369
I would never want to upset you.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.505
But you have, Bruce.

11:42.043 --> 11:44.543
Hide out here all you want.

11:47.248 --> 11:50.015
Bury your head in the sand.

11:53.020 --> 11:54.753
You're still guilty.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.029
It'll be slow.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.836
And it'll be painful.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.908
But it's what you deserve.

12:24.752 --> 12:28.153
I'm just sorry I won't be here
to see you bloom.

12:52.242 --> 12:54.104
No.

12:54.323 --> 12:55.610
No.

12:55.901 --> 12:57.478
No.

12:57.513 --> 13:00.151
- None of these will do.
- Where's Ivy?

13:00.176 --> 13:01.208
What did she do to me?

13:01.255 --> 13:02.754
- Where am I?
- Ah.

13:04.676 --> 13:07.626
- Just the thing.
- Ra's al Ghul?

13:07.661 --> 13:09.595
"Ra's al Ghul."

13:09.630 --> 13:10.974
Nope. Never heard of him.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.502
I'm Dr. Greenthumb.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.592
Just here to do a little
light pruning, really.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.068
No. No!

13:17.163 --> 13:18.863
No!

13:22.222 --> 13:23.932
There.

13:24.315 --> 13:26.729
That's better.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.374
Ah.

13:30.409 --> 13:31.821
Mommy always used to say:

13:31.911 --> 13:33.744
a little pruning encourages growth.

13:35.462 --> 13:37.229
Where are you taking that?

13:37.298 --> 13:38.482
Thanks, poppet.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.284
Where are you taking my face?

13:40.479 --> 13:42.086
Please.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.255
What's happening to me?

13:44.290 --> 13:46.534
My dear boy.

13:46.684 --> 13:48.869
You're dying.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.262
Just hold still,
while I put these in place.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.997
- No.
- Good Lord.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.158
No!

14:06.817 --> 14:08.150
Jim.

14:08.247 --> 14:09.613
What a pleasant surprise.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.882
- I'm looking for Selina.
- Haven't seen her.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.012
She's more of an alley cat
than a house cat.

14:14.051 --> 14:16.173
- Now, I'm just in the middle of something.
- Let him in.

14:20.952 --> 14:22.503
Hello, James.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.528
It's been a while.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.556
Barbara, can you give us a moment?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.633
Sure.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.669
Have fun, lovebirds.

14:37.364 --> 14:39.343
What is your business with Barbara Kean?

14:39.419 --> 14:42.187
You're worried that I told her
about our arrangement?

14:43.890 --> 14:45.763
I know how to keep a secret.

14:45.794 --> 14:47.826
Now, I want my man Carmichael released

14:47.861 --> 14:50.762
- from GCPD custody.
- That wasn't the deal.

14:50.797 --> 14:53.787
- You run the underworld.
- I run the GCPD.

14:53.818 --> 14:56.015
Your guy got arrested. That's on him.

14:56.101 --> 14:58.536
Let me make something clear.

14:58.788 --> 15:01.969
Our deal is whatever I say it is.

15:02.024 --> 15:03.891
Unless you want people to know

15:03.953 --> 15:06.044
you're responsible
for bringing the Pyg to town.

15:07.095 --> 15:09.849
You brought him to Gotham.
I was just trying to stop Penguin.

15:09.904 --> 15:13.302
But you covered it up and
took credit for killing him.

15:13.365 --> 15:15.039
Word gets out, you're destroyed.

15:15.075 --> 15:18.176
Along with your beloved GCPD.

15:18.280 --> 15:22.949
And if I go down... so will you.

15:23.037 --> 15:25.749
And I think you like being
queen of the underworld.

15:25.821 --> 15:29.423
You still think you know
what I will and won't do.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.258
I know a bluff when I see one.

15:34.997 --> 15:36.596
I have a job to do.

15:39.768 --> 15:41.549
Selina!

15:41.670 --> 15:44.604
Oh, hey, Jim. I found Selina.
She went that way.

15:50.612 --> 15:52.579
No, no, no!

15:52.614 --> 15:54.504
Shut your beak.

15:54.692 --> 15:57.826
No! No. No. No...

16:06.366 --> 16:09.996
- What do you want?
- I told you, Pengy.

16:10.032 --> 16:13.033
I'm gonna cure you
of this sad sack mopey act.

16:13.068 --> 16:14.935
And the best cure

16:14.970 --> 16:17.734
is the laughing cure.

16:20.509 --> 16:21.975
Make me laugh.

16:22.304 --> 16:24.478
Make him laugh! Make him laugh!

16:24.513 --> 16:27.147
So, what'll you be performing?

16:27.182 --> 16:29.316
Uh, contortionism?

16:29.351 --> 16:31.151
Juggling act? A tight five?

16:31.186 --> 16:33.620
Oh, what's that?

16:34.513 --> 16:37.014
You want to do a clown dance?

16:37.201 --> 16:39.201
- Yeah!
- Wonderful.

16:41.864 --> 16:43.530
I will not!

16:44.533 --> 16:46.333
- Huh?
- No.

16:47.369 --> 16:49.669
Hands off... No!

16:49.705 --> 16:51.404
Make him laugh!

16:51.440 --> 16:52.639
Make him laugh!

16:52.674 --> 16:55.375
Make him laugh! Make him laugh!

16:55.410 --> 16:57.811
Make him laugh!

16:57.846 --> 16:59.546
- Ugh...
- In your own time.

17:03.185 --> 17:05.897
You have no idea how I've suffered.

17:06.022 --> 17:10.089
The betrayals I've endured.
Just... just leave me alone.

17:11.425 --> 17:13.226
- Leave me alone.
- Cut!

17:17.633 --> 17:19.031
Hey.

17:19.568 --> 17:22.123
Oswald, Oswald, Oswald.

17:22.178 --> 17:25.405
You are trapped in a prison.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.674
In here.

17:27.912 --> 17:30.701
And I'm offering you the key.

17:30.746 --> 17:33.246
So... dance.

17:33.282 --> 17:37.250
Make him laugh! Make him laugh!
Make him laugh!

17:37.286 --> 17:39.619
Now we're talking.

17:39.655 --> 17:41.188
I can feel the funny coming.

17:41.223 --> 17:42.389
Here it comes!

17:42.424 --> 17:44.925
Here comes the funny. Okay.

17:49.932 --> 17:51.431
And you're down.

17:54.903 --> 17:56.703
Fred Astaire you are not.

17:58.807 --> 18:02.642
- We'll try again tomorrow.
- Come on!

18:20.028 --> 18:22.495
Ow! What the hell, man?

18:22.541 --> 18:24.011
Why were you running, Selina?

18:24.036 --> 18:25.839
'Cause a jerk with a badge
was chasing me.

18:25.868 --> 18:27.634
So not because you were
in Roland Charles's house

18:27.669 --> 18:29.603
last night when he was
turned into a tree?

18:29.801 --> 18:32.001
His family saw a redhead and a brunette.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.380
The brunette was carrying a
leather whip just like yours.

18:34.405 --> 18:35.871
Tell me I'm crazy.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.812
I swear, I was only there
to rob the place.

18:38.847 --> 18:40.480
So what about the redhead?

18:40.515 --> 18:42.749
She killed some tweaker in
the Narrows the same way.

18:42.784 --> 18:44.417
I need a name.

18:44.453 --> 18:46.286
Ivy Pepper.

18:46.321 --> 18:48.455
Try again. I know Ivy.

18:48.490 --> 18:50.023
No, Gordon, she's changed.

18:50.052 --> 18:51.785
Like, a lot.

18:51.810 --> 18:54.361
She can use plants
to hypnotize people, and poison them.

18:55.146 --> 18:56.630
So why'd she want to kill Roland?

18:56.665 --> 18:58.365
'Cause he works for Wayne Enterprises.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.860
- Wayne Enterprises.
- She's obsessed with this

19:00.885 --> 19:02.665
super secret project they're doing.

19:03.517 --> 19:07.264
Lucius lied. Come on. Let's go.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.648
Admiring my handiwork?

19:15.751 --> 19:17.484
Excuse me?

19:20.370 --> 19:22.470
Look how beautiful he became.

19:24.726 --> 19:26.967
And all it took...

19:27.195 --> 19:30.030
was a little scratch.

19:30.499 --> 19:32.327
Oh...

19:32.668 --> 19:35.038
Well, what do you want from me?

19:35.085 --> 19:37.037
I want to know about Project M.

19:38.233 --> 19:40.307
- What is Project M?
- Mm-mm-mm.

19:40.342 --> 19:42.242
Bruce Wayne told me everything.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.744
How he didn't even trust himself
with the location,

19:44.780 --> 19:46.546
but that you know where it is.

19:48.617 --> 19:51.418
And you're going to take me to it.

19:55.190 --> 19:57.310
But first,

19:57.888 --> 20:00.248
you probably want to tell me
I'm beautiful.

20:00.287 --> 20:01.428
Yeah.

20:01.583 --> 20:03.259
Yes.

20:08.634 --> 20:10.307
Help!

20:11.225 --> 20:13.826
Help! Somebody help me!

20:31.415 --> 20:33.915
Jim. Jim, you need to help me.

20:33.955 --> 20:35.415
Ouch.

20:35.455 --> 20:37.622
Looks like you cut yourself
shaving, old man.

20:37.657 --> 20:39.557
Jim, it's me, it's Bruce.

20:39.593 --> 20:41.459
I'm Bruce Wayne.

20:42.896 --> 20:46.097
Honey, I think we'd know
if you were Bruce Wayne.

20:46.132 --> 20:47.599
He's the one throwing this shindig.

20:47.634 --> 20:50.301
That's him yonder.

20:50.337 --> 20:52.604
Bruce, you're incorrigible.

20:52.639 --> 20:54.606
I may bust a gut.

20:54.641 --> 20:57.024
Luckily, I am a doctor.

20:57.244 --> 21:00.778
Ain't he the cat's pajamas?

21:01.204 --> 21:02.712
Come on.

21:06.119 --> 21:07.884
Easy there, sport.

21:07.922 --> 21:10.155
- That's Italian velvet.
- What did you do?

21:10.194 --> 21:12.062
Where's Ra's al Ghul?

21:12.124 --> 21:13.653
Ra's al who?

21:13.689 --> 21:15.683
That's my face. He gave you my face.

21:15.738 --> 21:16.823
That's my face!

21:16.858 --> 21:18.825
Think you've been hitting the gin.

21:18.860 --> 21:22.296
Give me back my face! I'm Bruce Wayne!

21:22.571 --> 21:26.094
Get off of me. You're ruining my fun.

21:28.274 --> 21:30.804
Everything all right, Master Bruce?

21:30.839 --> 21:32.639
Yes, thank you.

21:32.674 --> 21:34.207
Just getting rid of the riffraff.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.449
Ha, ha!

21:43.363 --> 21:46.160
Dude, what is it with you
and the arm-grabbing?

21:46.199 --> 21:47.796
Harper. I need keys to lockup.

21:47.821 --> 21:49.052
- And is Lucius in his office?
- Let go.

21:49.087 --> 21:51.890
Lucius? No, he left with Ivy
a little while ago.

21:51.952 --> 21:53.156
Ivy Pepper?

21:53.191 --> 21:54.858
- She was here?
- Yeah.

21:54.893 --> 21:56.793
She asked me
to introduce her to everyone.

21:56.828 --> 21:58.461
Isn't she the coolest?

21:58.497 --> 21:59.863
She's a psycho

21:59.898 --> 22:01.821
who turned a guy into a potted plant.

22:01.891 --> 22:03.900
What's going on with you?

22:04.591 --> 22:06.860
Did he just say Ivy's a psycho?

22:07.274 --> 22:08.738
But Ivy's the best.

22:11.610 --> 22:14.452
Is this the, uh, hypnosis
I've been hearing about?

22:14.477 --> 22:16.112
I'm gonna say yeah.

22:16.148 --> 22:18.715
And until it fades,
they'll do anything for her.

22:18.907 --> 22:20.977
And think she's the coolest.

22:23.321 --> 22:25.751
What do you mean by "Ivy's a psycho"?

22:25.791 --> 22:28.258
Hold that thought, Harper.

22:28.294 --> 22:29.993
We'll be right back.

22:30.431 --> 22:33.055
You hear what the captain
said about Ivy?

22:33.080 --> 22:35.981
- But Ivy's awesome.
- Yeah, she is the coolest.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.350
No more, no more!

22:48.495 --> 22:50.436
You have a visitor.

22:57.838 --> 22:59.867
Hello, Oswald.

23:01.351 --> 23:03.241
I see Arkham's treating you well.

23:05.512 --> 23:07.012
I take it you're here to gloat.

23:07.273 --> 23:08.947
You are correct.

23:09.983 --> 23:11.906
And why not?

23:12.186 --> 23:14.686
I am in an insane asylum.

23:15.956 --> 23:18.490
Being pummeled by lunatics.

23:19.960 --> 23:23.261
Then again, at least I'm not a moron.

23:25.332 --> 23:27.836
I may not be the man I once was.

23:28.852 --> 23:30.860
But I have many things
that you do not have.

23:30.904 --> 23:32.971
A purpose.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.272
Friends.

23:34.308 --> 23:35.507
You have neither of those.

23:36.007 --> 23:38.043
And I wanted you to see that.

23:42.186 --> 23:44.022
No.

23:44.850 --> 23:46.183
I know you.

23:46.256 --> 23:48.639
There's something else going on.

23:48.784 --> 23:50.417
Something else brought you here.

23:52.726 --> 23:54.392
There's nothing else.

23:54.660 --> 23:57.062
I wanted you to see how well

23:57.097 --> 23:58.263
I am doing.

23:58.298 --> 24:00.332
And I wanted to see
how miserable you are.

24:00.367 --> 24:02.834
Mission accomplished.

24:02.870 --> 24:04.489
Ed.

24:05.272 --> 24:06.805
I'm gonna be out of here soon.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.207
And once I am,

24:09.243 --> 24:14.713
I am going to wipe that smile

24:14.748 --> 24:16.236
off of your face.

24:16.510 --> 24:18.110
Preferably with a chain saw.

24:18.185 --> 24:19.384
Ow.

24:19.419 --> 24:21.153
How are you gonna do that?

24:21.188 --> 24:23.255
You have no friends.

24:23.290 --> 24:25.472
No one to help you escape.

24:26.066 --> 24:28.394
You are utterly alone.

24:30.731 --> 24:32.564
Good-bye, Oswald.

24:34.301 --> 24:35.500
Sorry,

24:35.536 --> 24:38.003
but I don't put too much stock

24:38.038 --> 24:40.939
in the opinions of simpletons!

24:55.289 --> 24:57.189
"I am held captive all day.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.212
"My brilliance locked away.

24:59.326 --> 25:01.274
"This prison must be broken.

25:01.395 --> 25:03.173
"The key?

25:05.399 --> 25:07.299
My name, which must be spoken."

25:12.168 --> 25:14.401
You're still in there.

25:17.304 --> 25:19.442
That's why you came.

25:19.744 --> 25:22.112
You're still there.

25:22.249 --> 25:25.083
And you're gonna help me
find a way out of here.

25:25.118 --> 25:26.718
Hello?

25:26.753 --> 25:28.019
We should be leaving.

25:28.054 --> 25:30.378
Not until we find out
where Ivy took Lucius.

25:30.411 --> 25:32.078
There has to be something.

25:42.669 --> 25:45.103
<i>You know where it is and
you are going to take me to it.</i>

25:45.130 --> 25:48.173
<i>Mmm. You're so incredible.</i>

25:48.208 --> 25:49.474
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

25:49.509 --> 25:51.943
<i>Where is Project M?</i>

25:51.979 --> 25:53.845
<i>Wayne Biotech has a secret facility</i>

25:53.880 --> 25:56.231
<i>outside the city
at the edge of Kane Park.</i>

25:56.285 --> 25:58.519
Good man, Lucius.

25:58.559 --> 26:00.325
In here.

26:01.121 --> 26:02.654
Hey, Cap.

26:02.689 --> 26:04.319
The boys and I were talking.

26:04.351 --> 26:05.721
And we didn't really like the way

26:05.746 --> 26:07.288
that you were talking about Ivy.

26:07.327 --> 26:09.343
I told you we should have left.

26:10.030 --> 26:13.298
Look, I think you misinterpreted
what I was saying.

26:14.868 --> 26:16.434
You called Ivy a psycho.

26:16.837 --> 26:19.504
That's a term of endearment.

26:19.539 --> 26:21.626
I love Ivy. I think she's great.

26:21.742 --> 26:23.275
What about you?

26:23.310 --> 26:24.476
Do you love Ivy?

26:24.511 --> 26:26.511
Yeah.

26:26.546 --> 26:28.346
I love Ivy.

26:29.314 --> 26:32.088
- How much?
- I love Ivy

26:32.158 --> 26:35.210
so much that I wish I could be her.

26:37.391 --> 26:38.823
You're not really selling it.

26:39.155 --> 26:40.659
And you think you did?

26:41.187 --> 26:42.794
Run.

26:42.829 --> 26:43.828
Get 'em!

26:46.109 --> 26:47.499
Selina!

26:49.915 --> 26:51.523
Break it down!

27:09.085 --> 27:12.791
All right, Oswald, ole buddy, ole pal.

27:12.926 --> 27:15.326
Tonight we're gonna cure you.

27:15.385 --> 27:17.685
Make me laugh or else.

27:17.710 --> 27:22.613
Let's call this the sudden death round.

27:27.703 --> 27:29.636
Dietrich?

27:40.768 --> 27:43.658
Okay, that was clever-ish.

27:47.386 --> 27:49.274
Yeah, that's a spoon.

27:49.597 --> 27:51.210
It is also a fork!

27:51.245 --> 27:53.245
Looks like you got some
fight in you still,

27:53.280 --> 27:55.581
but it's just too little, too late,

27:55.616 --> 27:58.617
too... boring.

27:58.668 --> 28:00.652
Lobotomize the little bird.

28:00.894 --> 28:03.191
Wait, wait.

28:03.853 --> 28:07.822
You said this prison is all in my mind.

28:07.928 --> 28:11.523
Maybe I'm in a prison right now,

28:11.599 --> 28:15.634
a prison where you can't get to me.

28:31.236 --> 28:33.329
Okay.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.456
You really are nuts.

28:47.361 --> 28:49.039
Clack!

28:49.638 --> 28:51.838
Clackety, clack, clack! Clack!

28:58.045 --> 28:59.278
Ah.

29:04.885 --> 29:06.652
- Thank you.
- Oh.

29:13.284 --> 29:15.517
Oh, yeah!

29:23.771 --> 29:27.076
Try laughing now, you ginger sap!

29:27.241 --> 29:28.709
Yes!

29:38.786 --> 29:41.820
See? I told you I'd cure you.

29:41.856 --> 29:43.722
Don't flatter yourself!

29:43.757 --> 29:45.324
One more.

29:50.784 --> 29:52.364
And so, I said

29:52.399 --> 29:54.333
to the guy...
you want to know what I said?

29:54.368 --> 29:56.428
I said, "What is this?

29:56.570 --> 29:58.537
A three-ring circus?"

30:02.949 --> 30:04.916
And keep 'em coming.

30:12.319 --> 30:14.933
How long do you think
you can hide in here?

30:15.589 --> 30:17.780
Look.

30:17.958 --> 30:19.725
Out there.

30:20.794 --> 30:23.553
He's going to find you eventually.

30:23.882 --> 30:25.882
I don't understand.

30:25.933 --> 30:27.699
Who's going to find me?

30:39.024 --> 30:40.352
Alfred?

30:40.399 --> 30:43.196
Special Agent Pennyworth
to you, you scumbag.

30:43.235 --> 30:44.750
Package secured.

30:44.785 --> 30:48.016
- Requesting extraction.
- No!

30:55.062 --> 30:57.162
Just be careful in here.

30:57.198 --> 30:59.498
We're gonna go this way.

31:01.535 --> 31:03.388
This way.

31:07.808 --> 31:10.505
So, this is it.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.473
Project M.

31:15.449 --> 31:17.012
Also...

31:17.380 --> 31:19.518
called Lazarus Water.

31:19.553 --> 31:21.787
It belonged to a man
known as Ra's al Ghul.

31:21.822 --> 31:24.886
It stimulates cell growth
at an alarming rate.

31:25.025 --> 31:27.597
We've yet to figure out how.

31:29.964 --> 31:31.863
I assumed Project M killed plants,

31:31.899 --> 31:33.932
but it's the opposite.

31:35.169 --> 31:36.535
Just like humans

31:36.570 --> 31:38.786
to lock up something so beautiful.

31:39.073 --> 31:41.039
What are you going to do with it?

31:43.736 --> 31:46.393
I'm going to make miracles happen.

31:56.253 --> 31:58.320
Release me!

32:00.622 --> 32:02.293
Listen to me. I'm Bruce Wayne!

32:02.340 --> 32:03.528
I can pay you whatever you want.

32:03.553 --> 32:05.083
You need to let me go now!

32:05.108 --> 32:07.004
Sorry, I can't do that, my old love.

32:07.039 --> 32:08.520
You see, I have a mission.

32:08.536 --> 32:09.868
What mission?

32:09.904 --> 32:13.372
For me to bring you to him.

32:16.243 --> 32:17.910
What is that?

32:19.780 --> 32:21.046
Well, giddyup, son.

32:42.169 --> 32:44.286
What do you want?

32:44.371 --> 32:45.838
Why did you bring me here?

32:45.873 --> 32:47.673
This is where my parents were killed!

32:47.708 --> 32:49.508
No.

32:49.667 --> 32:52.203
This is where I was born.

32:56.417 --> 32:57.555
No!

33:06.339 --> 33:07.779
That's far enough.

33:10.764 --> 33:12.464
Jim Gordon.

33:12.499 --> 33:13.599
Ivy Pepper?

33:13.634 --> 33:15.367
It's been a long time.

33:15.402 --> 33:18.203
I'm not the same kid you remember.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.272
The kid whose father

33:20.307 --> 33:21.540
you and your partner killed,

33:21.575 --> 33:23.108
all those years ago.

33:24.835 --> 33:26.544
How is this possible?

33:26.575 --> 33:29.114
Well, first, I was a seed.

33:29.926 --> 33:32.217
Then a sprout.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.519
Now I've bloomed.

33:35.438 --> 33:36.937
Drop your gun.

33:37.958 --> 33:39.424
- Or your friend Lucius...
- Hmm.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.418
...becomes a flower arrangement.

33:50.572 --> 33:52.373
Lucius, you okay?

33:53.207 --> 33:55.807
I'm in the sweet embrace of one
of my favorite people, Jim.

33:55.843 --> 33:57.793
Never been better.

33:57.825 --> 33:59.693
Now, I know you're tenacious,

33:59.739 --> 34:01.380
Jim Gordon, gun or no gun.

34:01.567 --> 34:03.551
You'll come after me.

34:04.018 --> 34:07.653
But then... Bruce Wayne will die.

34:09.100 --> 34:10.409
What have you done to him?

34:10.456 --> 34:13.003
I went to Wayne Manor
and planted a seed.

34:13.362 --> 34:15.726
I imagine he's about to bloom.

34:15.763 --> 34:17.094
But if you let me go,

34:18.462 --> 34:21.251
you may have a chance

34:21.353 --> 34:23.402
to get him the antidote.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.107
This isn't over.

34:29.143 --> 34:31.376
You have no idea how right you are.

34:32.713 --> 34:34.907
I love you.

34:35.649 --> 34:37.215
Lucius, give me the antidote.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.619
Uh, let's just wait until
Ivy's at a safe distance.

34:40.654 --> 34:42.387
Give me the antidote. Come on.

34:43.295 --> 34:45.172
- Don't make me hit you.
- Jim.

34:45.225 --> 34:48.525
I must warn you,
I'm a black belt in jiu-jitsu.

34:48.594 --> 34:50.661
- Since when?
- Night classes.

34:58.272 --> 35:00.356
- The Lazarus Water.
- Come on.

35:00.402 --> 35:01.974
We got to get to Bruce Wayne.

35:02.009 --> 35:03.308
Let's go.

35:27.634 --> 35:29.568
Help!

35:31.138 --> 35:33.720
Somebody help!

35:35.609 --> 35:37.970
Who's there?

35:38.548 --> 35:40.512
Show yourself!

35:47.921 --> 35:49.888
Who are you?

35:51.424 --> 35:54.706
I am the one you cannot escape.

35:55.540 --> 35:58.124
The one you cannot kill.

36:00.718 --> 36:02.990
You're me.

36:03.737 --> 36:04.803
Please.

36:04.838 --> 36:07.739
You're scared. You should be.

36:13.781 --> 36:15.948
It's okay, Bruce. It's all right.

36:16.183 --> 36:18.050
You're safe now.

36:26.081 --> 36:27.738
According to Lucius,

36:27.816 --> 36:31.027
Ivy's toxin attacks the brain
like a hallucinogen.

36:31.702 --> 36:34.476
So, whatever you went through,

36:34.522 --> 36:35.941
I doubt it was pleasant.

36:36.024 --> 36:37.929
But it wasn't real.

36:39.202 --> 36:41.672
I think I saw who I really am.

36:44.366 --> 36:46.188
I know what you're gonna say,

36:46.368 --> 36:49.068
but what I saw... it was real.

36:51.695 --> 36:53.762
Well, then you're lucky.

36:54.025 --> 36:56.078
Most people go their whole lives
not ever knowing

36:56.111 --> 36:58.267
- who they really are.
- I'm not lucky.

36:58.713 --> 37:00.680
You didn't see it.

37:07.455 --> 37:09.422
I've seen my own darkness.

37:11.393 --> 37:12.969
I'll say this.

37:13.547 --> 37:16.792
You have people around you
who care for you.

37:18.363 --> 37:20.229
Don't fight this alone.

37:20.264 --> 37:21.731
Trust us.

37:24.035 --> 37:25.801
I'll leave men outside tonight.

37:26.306 --> 37:28.638
I'll come by tomorrow, check in on you.

37:30.408 --> 37:31.707
Jim?

37:33.778 --> 37:35.344
When I was under,

37:36.028 --> 37:37.505
I saw you.

37:38.929 --> 37:40.942
You had a moustache.

37:45.075 --> 37:47.189
Well, clearly,
that's a very dangerous toxin.

38:04.308 --> 38:06.199
Alfred, it's...

38:06.410 --> 38:08.285
it's me, it's Bruce. I...

38:12.121 --> 38:14.528
I need your help, Alfred.

38:15.403 --> 38:16.981
Please call me.

38:31.048 --> 38:32.535
We're not hypnotized.

38:32.725 --> 38:33.915
Just embarrassed.

38:36.267 --> 38:37.963
Good to have you back.

38:38.943 --> 38:40.548
All right, listen up.

38:40.892 --> 38:43.548
I want an APB on Ivy Pepper.

38:43.595 --> 38:45.448
Finding her is our top priority.

38:45.483 --> 38:46.949
All right, you heard him, people.

38:46.984 --> 38:48.584
Let's get to work.

38:48.959 --> 38:50.319
What do you want?

38:50.354 --> 38:51.921
<i>I thought about what you said.</i>

38:51.956 --> 38:53.789
How if I used the Pyg to destroy you,

38:53.825 --> 38:55.748
I'd also destroy myself.

38:55.773 --> 38:56.897
<i>And?</i>

38:57.224 --> 39:00.099
And... you're right.

39:00.298 --> 39:02.898
I've come to enjoy
being the queen of Gotham.

39:02.934 --> 39:04.166
Glad we understand each other.

39:04.202 --> 39:06.001
<i>Not quite. You see, I also realized</i>

39:06.037 --> 39:07.337
<i>I don't need the Pyg.</i>

39:09.040 --> 39:11.941
There are other ways for me to hurt you.

39:19.494 --> 39:21.197
Thank you so much for coming.

39:21.479 --> 39:23.596
I thought we were overdue for a chat.

39:23.737 --> 39:25.855
How could I say no to my sister-in-law?

39:37.540 --> 39:39.604
So I strangled him with his lower...

39:45.118 --> 39:47.190
Relax, buddy.

39:47.411 --> 39:49.044
You gave me what I needed.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.380
The laugh of the century.

39:52.717 --> 39:54.483
Ah.

39:56.187 --> 39:57.925
Tell me something.

39:58.189 --> 40:00.604
You appear to have everyone here
under your thumb.

40:00.644 --> 40:02.358
The guards, the inmates.

40:02.393 --> 40:05.161
What can I say? I'm a charismatic guy.

40:07.263 --> 40:09.031
You could escape anytime.

40:09.066 --> 40:10.299
Why stay?

40:10.334 --> 40:11.997
Hmm.

40:12.503 --> 40:14.170
Why indeed?

40:16.040 --> 40:17.573
You're planning something.

40:17.608 --> 40:19.708
Righty-o, old boy.

40:19.919 --> 40:22.004
Something...

40:22.413 --> 40:25.080
spectacular.

40:25.262 --> 40:27.583
See, I'm in this funny farm
'cause I need to find

40:27.618 --> 40:29.910
the crème de la crazy.

40:33.891 --> 40:36.225
Which is why I need you.

40:43.935 --> 40:45.568
Ah, you get it.

40:45.603 --> 40:48.070
But when we're done,

40:48.105 --> 40:50.551
the world out there...

40:50.731 --> 40:53.301
that'll be the asylum.

40:53.744 --> 40:55.411
What do you say?

40:57.593 --> 41:00.027
Thank you for your kind offer.

41:00.085 --> 41:01.894
Mm-hmm.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.521
I don't expect to be here very long.

41:08.043 --> 41:09.871
Hmm.

41:12.363 --> 41:14.840
You'll come around.

41:15.633 --> 41:18.131
They always do.

41:29.647 --> 41:31.483
Nope.

42:02.621 --> 42:04.569
Where did these plants come from?

42:04.668 --> 42:07.871
Get out. Before we call the police.

42:37.137 --> 42:39.115
Oh, friends,

42:39.539 --> 42:41.840
you're all so beautiful.
