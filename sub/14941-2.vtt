WEBVTT

00:10.341 --> 00:13.344
(Gunshot)

00:21.021 --> 00:23.354
(Sirens wails)

00:27.027 --> 00:29.028
You were fast. Where were ya?

00:29.029 --> 00:31.231
At the office, closing
up the silverman case.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.303
At this hour? You
need to get a life.

00:33.304 --> 00:35.135
Detectives Morris and baker?

00:35.136 --> 00:37.367
How'd we pull them
two cases in a row?

00:37.368 --> 00:39.369
Yeah, just lucky, I guess.

00:39.370 --> 00:42.242
What do we got
here? Uh, two dead.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.814
Dave piaseki, 23, and
Linda Chapman, 22.

00:44.815 --> 00:46.246
Both shot in the head.

00:46.247 --> 00:49.319
Liver temp and lividity puts it
around 11:00 P.M. last night.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.822
No witnesses. Just a hiker
found 'em and called it in.

00:52.823 --> 00:54.254
So young.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.286
Dr. Hunt, how nice
to see you again.

00:56.287 --> 00:58.288
Detective Morris.

00:58.289 --> 01:00.190
You almost sound sincere.

01:00.191 --> 01:02.192
I hate to spoil
this little reunion,

01:02.193 --> 01:04.294
but you two wasted a trip.
There's no medical mystery here.

01:04.295 --> 01:06.166
It's a straight up
murder-suicide.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.168
She took the first bullet,

01:08.169 --> 01:10.170
and then he turned
the gun on himself.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.143
There's powder burns
on the right temple,

01:13.144 --> 01:16.846
and the gun is cradled in his right
hand. He has bruising on his left knuckles

01:16.847 --> 01:19.379
and a callus
pattern that indicates

01:19.380 --> 01:21.851
he's left-handed. If
you're left-handed,

01:21.852 --> 01:25.185
would you shoot yourself in
the head with your right hand?

01:25.186 --> 01:26.816
Doubtful.

01:26.817 --> 01:29.159
Okay, bruises and calluses
don't make him left-handed.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.821
True, but...

01:31.822 --> 01:35.825
Carrying your wallet in
your left back pocket does.

01:35.826 --> 01:37.827
(Sam) So much for robbery.

01:37.828 --> 01:40.130
Here we go again.

01:40.131 --> 01:42.173
Autopsy's in two hours.

01:45.136 --> 01:46.176
Damn it!

01:46.177 --> 01:47.307
You okay?

01:47.308 --> 01:50.181
Yeah, my hands
are acting up again.

01:53.844 --> 01:55.245
(Beep) Mom?

01:55.246 --> 01:58.288
Lacey! Hi. I was hoping
to get you before school.

01:58.289 --> 02:00.220
Uh, dad's waiting outside.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.421
Oh.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.193
I-I gotta go. (Beep)

02:03.194 --> 02:05.425
Um, I'm late. I-I
just wanted to know

02:05.426 --> 02:07.427
if you wanted to get
together after school today.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.859
Uh, I have riding after school.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.861
Uh, tomorrow? We
could... we could have lunch.

02:11.862 --> 02:13.833
Twist is right by your school.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.305
Uh... (Car horn honks)

02:15.306 --> 02:17.407
Lace? (Beep)

02:17.408 --> 02:21.341
(Sighs) Uh, okay, but
I gotta go. Bye, mom.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.173
Lace?

02:23.174 --> 02:24.914
(Sighs)

02:24.915 --> 02:26.916
Lunch?

02:26.917 --> 02:28.918
Remember you told me

02:28.919 --> 02:31.851
to give Lacey something
from my heart... Mm-hmm.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.283
For her birthday? Yeah.

02:33.284 --> 02:35.885
Well, I gave her a
key to my apartment.

02:35.886 --> 02:38.258
And when I came home later,

02:38.259 --> 02:40.860
she had left me a piece
of her birthday cake.

02:40.861 --> 02:41.891
A key?

02:41.892 --> 02:44.334
Mm-hmm.

02:44.335 --> 02:47.337
The point is, she's
giving me another chance.

02:47.338 --> 02:50.240
Well, I'm glad to hear it,
but just take it slow, okay?

02:50.241 --> 02:52.872
Didn't you just tell
me to get a life?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.905
I'm trying.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.449
(Elevator bell dings)

02:59.450 --> 03:01.311
There you are.

03:01.312 --> 03:03.353
Piaseki/chapman murder-suicide?

03:03.354 --> 03:05.355
Allegedmurder-suicide. Yes?

03:05.356 --> 03:07.317
Get Ethan and
Curtis to help you.

03:07.318 --> 03:10.920
I want this handled quickly and
efficiently. When do I ever do otherwise?

03:10.921 --> 03:13.424
Well, then I have nothing
to worry about, do I?

03:15.266 --> 03:17.367
Just out of curiosity,

03:17.368 --> 03:20.330
it's not a coincidence that we
pulled Morris and baker, is it?

03:20.331 --> 03:22.332
I spoke to their lieutenant.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.374
We agree that you four
seem to work well together.

03:24.375 --> 03:27.277
Unless you think otherwise? I think if
you're trying to break Megan, it won't work.

03:27.278 --> 03:30.209
I'm not trying to break
her. I'm trying to contain her.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.211
It's better to knock
heads with two detectives

03:32.212 --> 03:34.285
than the entire Philadelphia
police department.

03:40.451 --> 03:42.992
You know, we have low fat.

03:42.993 --> 03:45.256
I like it sweet.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.460
Got two bodies
coming in. Suit up.

03:50.461 --> 03:53.232
I am your superior, you know?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.435
Who keeps saying he
wants to be called a doctor?

03:55.436 --> 03:58.007
So come on. Show
me what you got.

03:58.008 --> 04:01.371
(Whispers) Ooh. Yeah, show
me what you got. Oh, shut up.

04:01.372 --> 04:03.373
So her bullet went in,

04:03.374 --> 04:05.915
and his... split in two.

04:05.916 --> 04:07.317
Maybe.

04:07.318 --> 04:09.319
Well, pull 'em out. Have a look.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.452
All in good time, detective.

04:12.453 --> 04:15.425
Dave piaseki lived in manayunk.

04:15.426 --> 04:18.888
Uh, first generation Polish.
Parents dead, no siblings.

04:18.889 --> 04:22.432
His landlord confirms
that he was left-handed.

04:22.433 --> 04:25.295
Um, Linda Chapman's
father is al Chapman,

04:25.296 --> 04:27.297
real estate developer.

04:27.298 --> 04:30.900
Uh, evidently, they were
an item back in the day.

04:30.901 --> 04:33.343
She went to springside,
and he went to roxborough.

04:33.344 --> 04:35.345
That's the opposite
sides of the tracks.

04:35.346 --> 04:36.976
How'd they meet?

04:36.977 --> 04:39.479
According to the chapmans,
they met right where they died.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.982
Valley green was a-a
teen hangout for years.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.385
The press is already
short-stroking it

04:45.386 --> 04:48.388
as a murder-suicide. Oh. I
wonder how they got that idea.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.390
She dumped him, that's how.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.021
She's rich, he's poor.

04:52.022 --> 04:54.994
She goes to college,
and he joins the Navy

04:54.995 --> 04:56.996
and has held nothing
but grunt construction jobs

04:56.997 --> 04:58.368
since he got out.

04:58.369 --> 05:01.401
He kept a candle burning,
she rejected him a second time,

05:01.402 --> 05:04.374
and then he takes them
both out. What's the mystery?

05:04.375 --> 05:08.037
There's a dry patch
on the left forearm...

05:08.038 --> 05:10.440
Possibly eczema
or contact dermatitis.

05:10.441 --> 05:14.414
Navy tattoo on the right.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.386
Ethan, got anything?

05:16.387 --> 05:20.019
She has a scar on her spine from an
old operation. Her makeup's a mess.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.091
And until recently, she
wore hair extensions.

05:22.092 --> 05:23.993
She's got traction alopecia.

05:23.994 --> 05:26.326
She was a beautiful girl.

05:28.399 --> 05:30.400
(Bullet clinks) Got the bullet.

05:30.401 --> 05:32.001
Bullet.

05:32.002 --> 05:34.033
Look, this is all very touching,

05:34.034 --> 05:37.336
but piaseki's prints
are on the gun.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.039
I haven't heard anything
that disproves murder-suicide.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.943
You may be right, detective.

05:43.974 --> 05:46.446
(Clink)

05:46.447 --> 05:48.378
But then again...

05:48.379 --> 05:50.980
(Squishing sounds, click)

05:50.981 --> 05:53.483
Maybe not.

05:53.484 --> 05:54.955
(Clink)

05:57.988 --> 06:01.931
That bullet didn't split in two.
Those are two separate rounds.

06:01.932 --> 06:04.494
So unless he shot
himself in the head twice,

06:04.495 --> 06:06.496
it wasn't a murder-suicide.

06:06.497 --> 06:09.399
This is straight up murder.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.040
(Fabric snaps)

06:11.041 --> 06:13.404
♪♪♪

06:24.054 --> 06:26.956
(Megan) So what
do we have? Peter?

06:26.957 --> 06:29.959
The scar down Linda's spine
was from a childhood accident.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.161
She was hit by a car, broke
her neck in three places.

06:32.162 --> 06:33.963
That would explain the rods.

06:33.964 --> 06:36.966
She had healed
Mallory-weiss tears.

06:36.967 --> 06:38.998
Uh, it's a bleeding
in the mucosa

06:38.999 --> 06:42.031
at the junction of the
esophagus and the stomach.

06:42.032 --> 06:43.503
Caused by vomiting,

06:43.504 --> 06:47.036
typically from bulimia,
alcoholism, or pregnancy.

06:47.037 --> 06:49.038
Yes, but she wasn't pregnant,

06:49.039 --> 06:50.510
and bulimia and alcoholism

06:50.511 --> 06:52.512
would've shown signs
of damage in the organs.

06:52.513 --> 06:56.085
What about Dave? Uh, some
recent respiratory complaints

06:56.086 --> 06:58.187
in his file. That's about
it. He wasn't a smoker.

06:58.188 --> 07:00.089
No. But he was in the Navy,

07:00.090 --> 07:03.523
and those guys... i mean, they're
exposed to everything, right?

07:03.524 --> 07:06.095
Yeah, but I didn't find any
plaques on the pleural surfaces.

07:06.096 --> 07:08.998
Now... What do
we think of these?

07:08.999 --> 07:11.961
Their last meal... Burgers
and green French fries.

07:11.962 --> 07:13.202
Anybody know where

07:13.203 --> 07:15.434
that particular happy
meal is served?

07:15.435 --> 07:18.037
I'll get bud and Sam on it.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.209
You two get busy
on Dave's lungs.

07:20.210 --> 07:21.541
(Ethan) Sure.

07:21.542 --> 07:25.444
Oh, no. I am not approving
any unnecessary tests.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.177
Curtis?

07:28.178 --> 07:30.179
Haven't you ever wanted

07:30.180 --> 07:32.982
a second chance
with your first love?

07:32.983 --> 07:34.984
Those two people will
never have that chance again,

07:34.985 --> 07:37.957
and I wanna know who
took it away from them.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.089
You're just trying to suck me
in to your crime-solving cult.

07:40.090 --> 07:42.091
No, I'm trying to get you

07:42.092 --> 07:45.165
to act like a doctor who
gives a damn. Mm-hmm.

07:55.205 --> 07:57.246
Green French fries, huh?

07:57.247 --> 07:58.508
Mm.

07:58.509 --> 08:00.249
Irish pub maybe?

08:00.250 --> 08:03.553
Either that or Dr. Seuss
just opened up a restaurant.

08:03.554 --> 08:07.016
Either way, it's food
dye, huh? Think so?

08:07.017 --> 08:10.259
He's from manayunk, huh? Yeah.

08:10.260 --> 08:13.122
You ever been to manayunk
Avenue on a weekend night? Nope.

08:13.123 --> 08:16.265
It's all burgers and
fries... And water ice.

08:16.266 --> 08:24.173
Mm. (Chuckles)

08:24.174 --> 08:27.507
(Chief) Mr. and Mrs. Chapman,
I know this is difficult for you.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.211
(Mr. Chapman sighs)

08:36.016 --> 08:37.516
Excuse me.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.549
I'm Dr. Hunt.

08:39.550 --> 08:43.122
I'll be handling your
daughter's case.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.996
I'm very sorry about your loss.

08:48.158 --> 08:51.030
I, um...

08:51.031 --> 08:53.032
I practically taught
her how to walk again

08:53.033 --> 08:54.303
after her operation.

08:54.304 --> 08:57.236
She was my baby.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.570
I was her protector.

09:03.113 --> 09:06.075
I just couldn't protect
her from that boy.

09:06.076 --> 09:08.578
We thought Dave got the message

09:08.579 --> 09:10.580
after Linda broke up
with him in high school.

09:10.581 --> 09:12.582
But we were wrong.

09:12.583 --> 09:15.325
If he couldn't have
Linda, no one would.

09:19.289 --> 09:21.290
Oh, when can we have her?

09:21.291 --> 09:23.292
We... we just want
to put our baby to rest.

09:23.293 --> 09:26.095
I'm afraid that's
not going to happen

09:26.096 --> 09:29.098
until the investigation's
over. What investigation?

09:29.099 --> 09:31.100
He killed our daughter.

09:31.101 --> 09:35.144
The story that the news
is reporting is wrong.

09:35.145 --> 09:39.008
This was a double homicide.

09:39.009 --> 09:41.010
Now I know you already
spoke to the police,

09:41.011 --> 09:43.012
but is there anything
else you can tell me

09:43.013 --> 09:46.085
that would help us in our
investigation? Like what?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.017
Dave was Linda's past.

09:48.018 --> 09:50.290
Who was her present?
Was she seeing anybody?

09:52.162 --> 09:54.223
Brian hall.

09:54.224 --> 09:56.365
He owns a restaurant downtown.

09:56.366 --> 10:00.129
Linda worked as a
hostess there last year

10:00.130 --> 10:04.033
while she was
applying to law schools.

10:04.034 --> 10:07.207
(Crying) But she ended
it with him months ago.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.309
Is there...

10:10.310 --> 10:13.142
It's all right. We can do
this another time. (Crying)

10:13.143 --> 10:14.343
And I promise you,

10:14.344 --> 10:17.246
we will get your daughter
to you as soon as we can.

10:17.247 --> 10:20.350
Thank you.

10:26.396 --> 10:28.397
So where are the police on this?

10:28.398 --> 10:31.030
Running down Dave
and Linda's last meal.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.362
I saw healed Mallory-weiss
tears on the prelim.

10:33.363 --> 10:36.165
Maybe you and Peter
should go find this Brian hall

10:36.166 --> 10:38.367
and see what Linda was
really doing to herself.

10:38.368 --> 10:41.211
Hmm. Exactly
what I was thinking.

10:45.115 --> 10:48.117
Yeah, poor Linda. I
heard about it on the news.

10:48.118 --> 10:50.349
You know, but I haven't
seen her since we broke up.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.381
When was that? Mm,
three months ago.

10:52.382 --> 10:55.054
(Megan) When you were dating,

10:55.055 --> 10:57.056
did you notice anything
wrong with her?

10:57.057 --> 11:00.089
Like, drinking too
much or not eating?

11:00.090 --> 11:03.132
Yeah, not eating wasn't
exactly Linda's problem, so... oh?

11:03.133 --> 11:05.094
You wanna watch out.
That'll stain your clothes.

11:05.095 --> 11:08.037
We clean the bar top with
lemon and baking soda.

11:08.038 --> 11:10.039
Mm. Must take all day.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.271
It... it takes two days,
actually. Off-hours.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.175
It's my annual nightmare.
So if you don't mind...

11:18.178 --> 11:19.409
Excuse me.

11:25.055 --> 11:27.116
You have beautiful hair.

11:27.117 --> 11:28.417
Oh. Thank you. (Chuckles)

11:28.418 --> 11:31.420
And that is some dress.

11:31.421 --> 11:33.292
It's a... it's the uniform.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.094
Some uniform. (Chuckles)

11:35.095 --> 11:39.098
Well, Brian, he... he insists.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.200
(Peter) So what
was Linda's problem?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.402
Hell, man, what are you asking
me all these questions for?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.404
I thought a medical
examiner cut up bodies.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.077
I'm not an m.E. I'm a
medicolegal investigator.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.079
I investigate anything to
do with a suspicious death.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.081
Or in this case, two.

11:52.082 --> 11:55.085
What do you mean suspicious? It
was a murder-suicide. No, it wasn't.

11:56.386 --> 11:59.249
Is being so... thin
part of the uniform?

12:01.391 --> 12:03.222
Excuse me.

12:03.223 --> 12:07.056
What happens when you
don't do what Brian wants?

12:07.057 --> 12:08.397
(Chuckles) (Brian) Nina.

12:08.398 --> 12:10.329
Don't say a damn word.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.062
Look, I told you I
never met Dave piaseki,

12:13.063 --> 12:15.364
and I haven't seen
Linda in months.

12:15.365 --> 12:19.139
Now... get the hell
out of my restaurant.

12:22.272 --> 12:24.113
(Laughing)

12:24.114 --> 12:25.344
Eric singleton?

12:25.345 --> 12:27.317
Who wants to know?

12:29.179 --> 12:33.422
Were you at, uh, Tom's burgers
on manayunk Avenue last night?

12:33.423 --> 12:35.284
I can't remember.

12:35.285 --> 12:37.086
Try remembering these two.

12:37.087 --> 12:38.287
We have witnesses

12:38.288 --> 12:40.390
that say you had words
with, uh, Dave piaseki.

12:43.393 --> 12:45.364
So what? So what happened?

12:45.365 --> 12:47.166
He should've known better,

12:47.167 --> 12:49.368
bringing his black bitch
into our neighborhood.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.369
Aah! Aah!

12:50.370 --> 12:53.442
Ow! What are you... aah! Ow! Ow!

12:53.443 --> 12:56.345
(Chuckles) I think you
had more than words.

12:56.346 --> 12:59.178
Oh. Dave got the
better of you, didn't he?

12:59.179 --> 13:01.210
Then you went
after him with a gun.

13:01.211 --> 13:03.212
The only thing I don't know

13:03.213 --> 13:05.354
is how you two geniuses
actually found him.

13:05.355 --> 13:08.287
(Grunts)

13:08.288 --> 13:10.089
(Lacey) Three.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.361
(Sighs) There we go.

13:13.223 --> 13:15.365
(Lacey laughs)

13:17.227 --> 13:19.268
I don't think this
is a good idea.

13:19.269 --> 13:22.271
What's the big deal? It was
on the way. It's like dating.

13:22.272 --> 13:25.134
You don't turn up
on a girl's doorstep

13:25.135 --> 13:27.136
right after she gave
you her number.

13:27.137 --> 13:30.179
I'm not dating my daughter.
Ugh. I just wanna say hi.

13:30.180 --> 13:33.312
Megan, correct me if I'm
wrong, but she lives with her dad.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.115
She blames you for the divorce.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.147
And after five years,
she's finally opening up.

13:38.148 --> 13:40.450
I don't think this is the
time to push your luck.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.193
(Car door closes)

13:44.194 --> 13:46.355
You know, I was meeting
some of my friends later,

13:46.356 --> 13:49.098
and I was wondering... hi, lace!

13:49.099 --> 13:51.200
Mm. Mom? What
are you doing here?

13:51.201 --> 13:54.103
You said you had
your lesson today.

13:54.104 --> 13:57.366
Yeah, but I'm not supposed
to meet you till tomorrow.

13:57.367 --> 13:59.108
Who's that?

13:59.109 --> 14:01.370
Mom! I'm sorry. I
just thought i'd...

14:01.371 --> 14:04.373
No, you didn't think,
mom. You didn't think at all.

14:04.374 --> 14:06.375
(Makes clicking noise)

14:06.376 --> 14:08.248
(Sighs)

14:18.428 --> 14:20.130
(Sighs)

14:22.362 --> 14:25.334
I may never have been
a neurosurgeon like you,

14:25.335 --> 14:29.138
but iama doctor, and I do care.

14:29.139 --> 14:31.370
Check Linda's teeth.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.243
If she was throwing
up to lose weight,

14:34.244 --> 14:37.276
the stomach acid would've
eroded the enamel.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.278
Okay.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.280
What are you looking for?

14:41.281 --> 14:42.412
Soap.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.420
You were right.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.422
There are signs of
erosion of the enamel

15:23.423 --> 15:25.354
on her lower molars.

15:25.355 --> 15:28.457
And what does that
tell you... Doctor?

15:28.458 --> 15:31.230
It confirms bulimia,
but not long-term.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.302
More like she just started.

15:33.303 --> 15:35.304
About a year, I bet.

15:35.305 --> 15:38.237
Right after she started
working for Brian hall.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.239
Hmm. What's that?

15:40.240 --> 15:43.272
A residue of
potassium bitartrate,

15:43.273 --> 15:46.415
sodium bicarbonate, and...

15:46.416 --> 15:48.217
(Sniffs) Lemon...

15:48.218 --> 15:50.219
The stuff hall uses
to clean his bar,

15:50.220 --> 15:52.381
which means...

15:52.382 --> 15:55.184
Dave was in that restaurant

15:55.185 --> 15:58.228
the day he was murdered.

16:07.197 --> 16:09.198
One thing you need to
know about me, detectives,

16:09.199 --> 16:11.200
is when I promise
something, I deliver.

16:11.201 --> 16:13.372
And I promised the chapmans

16:13.373 --> 16:17.176
they'll have their daughter back soon, so
where are we? Their last meal was in manayunk.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.178
Those weren't green
fries, by the way.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.311
They'd had lime water ice. Dave got into a
fight with a skinhead named Eric singleton.

16:22.312 --> 16:25.214
He's got a sheet, but he
also has two skinhead friends

16:25.215 --> 16:27.386
who swear they never
left manayunk that night.

16:27.387 --> 16:31.160
We assume they're lying, but
he has no connection to the gun,

16:31.161 --> 16:34.163
and we have nothing solid
to hold him on. And you?

16:34.164 --> 16:35.394
Linda was bulimic.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.167
All signs are it started
when she hooked up with

16:38.168 --> 16:42.171
a restaurateur named Brian hall. You
didn't say anything about that yesterday.

16:42.172 --> 16:44.173
We didn't confirm
bulimia until last night

16:44.174 --> 16:46.175
because her body has
had three months to recover

16:46.176 --> 16:49.308
from starving itself. The same three
months since she broke up with hall.

16:49.309 --> 16:53.182
He's a control freak with a
temper. But most importantly,

16:53.183 --> 16:55.484
Dave piaseki was
in his restaurant

16:55.485 --> 16:58.547
the night of the murder.
How do you know that?

16:58.548 --> 17:00.389
The stainless steel bar.

17:00.390 --> 17:02.391
They've been cleaning
it for the past two days

17:02.392 --> 17:04.393
with lemon, cream of
tartar, and baking soda.

17:04.394 --> 17:07.326
It left a residue on Dave's arm.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.459
Well, I guess we're gonna
go check out Brian hall.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.461
Hey, Curtis, check this out.

17:12.462 --> 17:14.463
I found the cause of
Dave's respiratory problems.

17:14.464 --> 17:16.505
Amphiboles in the aveoli.

17:16.506 --> 17:18.167
Asbestos?

17:18.168 --> 17:21.170
Yeah, and not from his Navy
days either. These are fresh.

17:21.171 --> 17:24.213
Just a few weeks old. Hello?

17:24.214 --> 17:25.444
He worked construction.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.447
What you want me to do
about it? Come with me.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.319
Where, out there?

17:30.320 --> 17:33.252
What am I, Nancy
drew all of a sudden?

17:33.253 --> 17:35.254
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.326
(Morris) I'm talking about
you threatening Linda so much,

17:37.327 --> 17:38.487
she disconnected her phone.

17:38.488 --> 17:40.429
I'm talking about
you threatening her

17:40.430 --> 17:43.462
in front of her neighbors
two months ago. Old news.

17:43.463 --> 17:47.336
Then why lie about it? You don't exactly
advertise when your ex turns up dead.

17:47.337 --> 17:50.199
What did Dave come
here to talk to you about?

17:50.200 --> 17:53.472
Blow a lot of hot air. You mean he threatened
you if you didn't leave Linda alone.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.345
Nobody threatens me.
Oh, and lives to tell about it.

17:56.346 --> 17:59.208
Hmm.

17:59.209 --> 18:02.311
You know what I think?

18:02.312 --> 18:05.214
I think that Dave kept a
candle burning for Linda.

18:05.215 --> 18:07.256
Three months ago,
he tracks her down,

18:07.257 --> 18:08.517
only to find out

18:08.518 --> 18:12.291
she's involved with a guy
who inflates his own ego

18:12.292 --> 18:15.194
by making women feel
bad about themselves.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.296
What pissed you
off more, Brian...

18:17.297 --> 18:21.300
Linda leaving or Dave
opening her eyes?

18:21.301 --> 18:23.372
You think you got it
all figured out, huh?

18:23.373 --> 18:26.335
Except for the part
thatididn't kill them.

18:26.336 --> 18:29.578
Then you won't mind telling us
where you were two nights ago.

18:29.579 --> 18:31.340
Nina.

18:31.341 --> 18:34.484
Get your ass over here.

18:37.347 --> 18:41.490
Tell 'em where I was
two nights ago, baby.

18:41.491 --> 18:43.493
With me.

18:48.558 --> 18:52.231
So now we have two
suspects with shaky alibis.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.433
Oh, I found her verycredible.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.435
I'll have another talk with her.

18:56.436 --> 18:59.238
Knock yourself out,
but singleton's our guy.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.510
How are you gonna
get her away from Brian?

19:01.511 --> 19:04.274
I'm not. You are.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.448
Come on. Admit it. She
got to you, didn't she?

19:09.449 --> 19:11.550
I don't know what you're
talking about. No, you said...

19:11.551 --> 19:13.552
(Deepens voice) "Who am I,
Nancy drew all of a sudden?"

19:13.553 --> 19:15.554
(Normal voice) I would've
gone Hardy boys, by the way,

19:15.555 --> 19:17.556
but that's just me.
You know what I meant.

19:17.557 --> 19:21.290
That's who we seem to be
working for these days... Nancy drew.

19:21.291 --> 19:23.362
Which is an interesting
thing for you to say

19:23.363 --> 19:27.236
considering you are the deputy chief. You
know, your mouth won't be flapping so much

19:27.237 --> 19:30.439
with my foot in it. It's like she has
some strange power over us. Here.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.441
Give me that hard hat.

19:32.442 --> 19:34.303
This one? That one.

19:34.304 --> 19:36.305
This one? (Muffled
voice) That one.

19:36.306 --> 19:38.577
You sure it's gonna
fit? Give me the hat.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.379
You got a big head.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.453
Let's see if this is where Dave
got his asbestos poisoning.

19:44.454 --> 19:46.515
(Speaks inaudibly) Hey!

19:46.516 --> 19:48.417
What are you doing?!

19:48.418 --> 19:49.618
Cur-Curtis! Curtis!

19:49.619 --> 19:51.560
What are you doing?! (Grunts)

19:51.561 --> 19:54.323
Cur... go! (Man) This is
private property! Get back here!

19:54.324 --> 19:56.365
Don't close the gate on
me! (Man) Get back here!

19:56.366 --> 19:58.497
Curtis, Curtis... Hey,
what are you doing?!

19:58.498 --> 20:02.231
Sorry about yesterday.

20:02.232 --> 20:04.233
(Indistinct conversations)

20:04.234 --> 20:06.275
What's his name?

20:06.276 --> 20:07.406
Who?

20:07.407 --> 20:09.438
The boy I saw you talking to.

20:09.439 --> 20:11.610
I don't know.

20:11.611 --> 20:15.444
You don't know or you don't want to
tell me? Can we just eat lunch, please?

20:15.445 --> 20:17.246
(Chuckles)

20:17.247 --> 20:20.249
(Utensil clatters)
I'm sorry. I just...

20:20.250 --> 20:22.391
There's so much I wanna know.

20:22.392 --> 20:24.553
Why? You never cared
before. That's not true.

20:24.554 --> 20:27.396
You were too busy with work.
That's what the judge said.

20:27.397 --> 20:29.398
I missed that court date
because I was a surgeon.

20:29.399 --> 20:32.401
I was saving someone's life. You
missed more than one, and I don't care.

20:32.402 --> 20:35.334
You don't get to tell
me how to feel. God...

20:35.335 --> 20:37.367
(Utensil clatters) I
knew this would happen.

20:44.314 --> 20:46.275
How do you feel?

20:46.276 --> 20:49.479
Like I can't breathe.
So just back off, okay?

20:52.522 --> 20:54.323
(Sighs)

20:54.324 --> 20:57.626
Look, I'm not ready for
this, so I'm just gonna go.

20:57.627 --> 20:59.458
Thanks for lunch.

20:59.459 --> 21:02.492
(Indistinct conversations)

21:06.366 --> 21:07.567
(Sighs)

21:48.478 --> 21:51.541
Gunshot residue?

21:53.543 --> 21:56.085
The killer closed her eyes.

22:11.461 --> 22:14.102
It's too bad you can't
get a print off the eyelid.

22:14.103 --> 22:16.334
Well, I did swab for d.N.A.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.107
Hey, he must've been sweating
to take off that much eye shadow.

22:19.108 --> 22:22.110
So if we're lucky, we'll
get a stray epithelial or two.

22:22.111 --> 22:24.112
You still think it's Brian hall?

22:24.113 --> 22:27.115
It's a theory, assuming his
new girlfriend is lying for him.

22:27.116 --> 22:29.618
But in order to prove that,

22:29.619 --> 22:32.351
I'm gonna need your help.

22:34.454 --> 22:37.526
(Morris) Seen your
friend Eric lately?

22:37.527 --> 22:39.528
We've been checking
up on you, lonny.

22:39.529 --> 22:42.391
It turns out your
dad is still, uh,

22:42.392 --> 22:44.393
declaring you as a dependent.
Which, seeing as you're not,

22:44.394 --> 22:47.095
makes him heading
upstate if you don't talk to us.

22:47.096 --> 22:49.568
Look, I never wanted to go
after that guy in the first place.

22:49.569 --> 22:53.141
Spell it out, lonny.
Eric had it in for that guy

22:53.142 --> 22:55.604
as soon as he showed
up with that black chick.

22:55.605 --> 22:59.408
Isn't this sweet? A
couple of lovebirds

22:59.409 --> 23:01.580
headed over to valley green. (Lonny)
He and Eric had words outside Tom's,

23:01.581 --> 23:04.583
but the girl pulled him
into the water ice shop.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.585
(Linda) Let's go get
some water ice. Come on.

23:06.586 --> 23:09.117
We were just hassling them.

23:09.118 --> 23:11.690
Then Eric says we're gonna
jump them when they come out.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.593
So... we did. Or we tried to.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.125
Eric made his move, and
the guy just nailed him.

23:17.126 --> 23:19.698
Pow. It was fast.
(Grunting and groaning)

23:19.699 --> 23:22.130
Eric dropped to his knees.

23:22.131 --> 23:25.634
That's it? Come on, lonny,
your dad's still heading upstate

23:25.635 --> 23:27.707
unless you give us
something we can use.

23:35.585 --> 23:37.446
(Sighs)

23:37.447 --> 23:39.588
Yesterday, Eric showed
up with blood on his jacket.

23:39.589 --> 23:42.452
He ditched it just before
you guys got there.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.131
(Sam sighs)

23:53.132 --> 23:56.465
Make sure you get the
bottom of that one over there.

23:56.466 --> 23:58.136
Nothing. (Paper bag rustles)

23:58.137 --> 23:59.709
Yeah, we... (Man) Detectives!

24:07.517 --> 24:10.148
Here you go.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.552
Now that's what I
call probable cause.

24:14.484 --> 24:17.455
(Keypad beeps)

24:17.456 --> 24:19.157
(Telephone rings)

24:19.158 --> 24:21.560
Ironworks restaurant. This
is Nina. Can I help you?

24:21.561 --> 24:23.532
Uh, Nina, my name
is Eddie Davis.

24:23.533 --> 24:26.535
I, uh, live on north newkirk,
just down the street from Brian.

24:26.536 --> 24:28.597
Yeah, I'm calling 'cause
his house is on fire.

24:28.598 --> 24:30.138
(Gasps)

24:30.139 --> 24:31.600
Oh, my god.

24:31.601 --> 24:33.241
Brian!

24:33.242 --> 24:34.574
(Beep)

24:36.606 --> 24:38.177
(Car alarm chirps)

24:39.649 --> 24:42.611
(Starts engine)

24:42.612 --> 24:44.152
(Tires squeal)

24:44.153 --> 24:47.156
(Revs engine)

24:54.724 --> 24:56.625
Nina.

24:56.626 --> 24:59.267
I have nothing to say to you.

24:59.268 --> 25:01.499
Are you willing to listen?

25:01.500 --> 25:04.604
(Sighs deeply)

25:09.709 --> 25:11.710
What am I doing here?

25:11.711 --> 25:15.283
I want you to meet someone.

25:15.284 --> 25:17.546
(Inhales sharply)

25:17.547 --> 25:19.688
This is Linda Chapman.

25:19.689 --> 25:21.620
(Gasps) You know who she is?

25:21.621 --> 25:24.593
(Whispers) Yeah. (Sniffles)

25:24.594 --> 25:27.626
Extensions,
bulimia, the uniform...

25:27.627 --> 25:29.528
It's all Brian, isn't it?

25:31.631 --> 25:33.261
She's a beautiful girl.

25:33.262 --> 25:36.164
So are you.

25:36.165 --> 25:38.707
And I can't stand the
thought of him doing to you

25:38.708 --> 25:41.539
what he did to Linda.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.273
Do you have somebody
to help you, Nina?

25:46.676 --> 25:48.647
(Crying)

25:48.648 --> 25:50.649
Has Brian threatened you

25:50.650 --> 25:53.582
if you try to leave
him like Linda did?

25:53.583 --> 25:55.584
(Sniffles)

25:55.585 --> 25:57.586
I don't know how to
get away from him.

25:57.587 --> 26:00.258
We do, and we'll help you,

26:00.259 --> 26:02.661
with counseling, with resources,

26:02.662 --> 26:04.733
with whatever you need.

26:04.734 --> 26:07.736
Listen, we've all done
stupid things for men,

26:07.737 --> 26:10.740
but don't let this jerk tell you
how to feel about yourself.

26:15.244 --> 26:18.206
(Whispers) Oh, god.

26:18.207 --> 26:21.179
You're safe now. Okay?

26:21.180 --> 26:23.211
And you can tell us the truth.

26:23.212 --> 26:24.653
(Sighs)

26:24.654 --> 26:27.216
Was Brian with you
the night of the murders?

26:29.358 --> 26:31.720
Yeah, he was.

26:31.721 --> 26:33.722
He really was. I'm sorry.

26:33.723 --> 26:38.296
He... (Sighs) He won't
let me out of his sight.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.329
(Sighs) Okay, listen, I'm gonna
send you to the women's shelter.

26:41.330 --> 26:43.331
There's a woman
there named Ann white,

26:43.332 --> 26:45.333
and she'll take care of you.

26:45.334 --> 26:47.676
(Whispers) Thank you.

26:47.677 --> 26:50.740
You're welcome.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.251
Looks like you
need a new theory.

27:18.768 --> 27:21.670
Okay, now these
are the amphiboles

27:21.671 --> 27:23.371
I found in Dave's lungs.

27:23.372 --> 27:25.774
You can see some grains
of sand and pollen, too.

27:25.775 --> 27:27.345
Amphiboles?

27:27.346 --> 27:30.348
Uh, it's a kind of asbestos
used in building construction.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.350
And here's the same
sand-pollen-amphibole mix

27:32.351 --> 27:34.683
we found at the site.

27:34.684 --> 27:36.384
It's an exact match.

27:36.385 --> 27:38.687
"We"?

27:38.688 --> 27:43.792
So somebody was cutting
corners and exposing workers?

27:43.793 --> 27:47.395
Well, maybe Dave threatened to blow
the whistle on them. So you're saying

27:47.396 --> 27:51.239
that Dave was the target, and Linda
was collateral damage? It's a theory.

27:51.240 --> 27:52.441
(Footsteps approaching)

27:55.374 --> 27:57.375
Peter, go with
Ethan to the job site

27:57.376 --> 27:59.347
and see what you can find. Sure.

27:59.348 --> 28:03.251
And, Curtis, check on my
d.N.A. Results, will you?

28:03.252 --> 28:04.753
What d.N.A. Results?

28:04.754 --> 28:08.686
The ones I ordered in your
name. Didn't think you'd mind.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.289
Told you.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.692
She has a strange power.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.725
You must know something by now.

28:16.726 --> 28:20.368
Well, we do know a few
things about your daughter...

28:20.369 --> 28:23.701
That might be difficult to hear.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.333
Like what?

28:25.334 --> 28:26.805
She was bulimic,

28:26.806 --> 28:28.807
and she had hair extensions

28:28.808 --> 28:31.239
that did permanent
damage to her scalp.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.441
And both of these
things seem to coincide

28:33.442 --> 28:37.385
with her relationship
with Brian hall.

28:37.386 --> 28:39.417
Did you know
anything about that?

28:39.418 --> 28:42.250
We kept pretty close
track of her through college,

28:42.251 --> 28:45.353
but when she got out, she
wanted to be independent.

28:45.354 --> 28:47.426
That's code for never
telling us anything.

28:49.398 --> 28:51.499
Well, I don't wanna Sully
your memory of your daughter,

28:51.500 --> 28:56.805
but I would like to correct
your memory of Dave piaseki.

28:56.806 --> 29:00.239
I think that he got
her away from Brian.

29:02.311 --> 29:04.512
And I think he
genuinely loved her.

29:04.513 --> 29:06.776
I know he did.

29:09.779 --> 29:12.420
He came to our house the
night they were murdered.

29:12.421 --> 29:15.323
He told us what Brian
had done to Linda.

29:15.324 --> 29:17.755
Why didn't you
mention this before?

29:17.756 --> 29:20.259
Because we didn't believe him.

29:29.799 --> 29:32.440
(Machinery whirring)

29:32.441 --> 29:34.272
Who the hell are you?

29:34.273 --> 29:36.274
Peter dunlop, medical
examiner's office.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.406
You? Gary Miller, foreman.

29:38.407 --> 29:41.249
Did you know that
Dave piaseki was dead?

29:41.250 --> 29:42.550
Yeah. I heard.

29:42.551 --> 29:45.253
And had asbestos in his lungs?

29:45.254 --> 29:47.255
You can take your mask off.

29:47.256 --> 29:49.557
We had an exposure
about a month ago,

29:49.558 --> 29:53.421
but we cleaned it up. Yeah, okay,
I'm gonna keep mine on, thanks.

29:53.422 --> 29:55.563
We did everything we
were supposed to do.

29:55.564 --> 29:57.495
Oh, except report it.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.268
Did Dave threaten
to tell the authorities?

30:00.269 --> 30:03.271
Look, pal, right now you're
facing an e.P.A. Violation.

30:03.272 --> 30:05.504
You wanna bump
that up to murder?

30:07.506 --> 30:10.308
Dave came by a few days ago.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.541
He wanted an
advance, a big one...

30:13.542 --> 30:15.543
But not to keep his mouth shut.

30:15.544 --> 30:18.387
So what did he need the
money for? An engagement ring.

30:21.590 --> 30:23.852
Thanks.

30:23.853 --> 30:28.296
Whoa, whoa. What about the
e.P.A.? They're on their way. Sorry.

30:28.297 --> 30:30.598
We took a soil sample. Remember
me? You're still contaminated.

30:30.599 --> 30:33.601
You gotta be kidding me. You...
(Scoffs) Does it look like I'm kidding?!

30:33.602 --> 30:35.434
(Peter) Come on.

30:40.569 --> 30:42.570
What are you doin'?

30:42.571 --> 30:45.413
Looking for evidence
of an engagement ring.

30:45.414 --> 30:47.545
How'd you know?

30:47.546 --> 30:50.278
Linda's mother.

30:50.279 --> 30:52.280
Dave asked her parents'
permission to marry her.

30:52.281 --> 30:55.483
Oh, they didn't think to
mention that? They felt guilty.

30:55.484 --> 30:58.557
They thought Dave killed
Linda because they said no.

31:00.489 --> 31:01.559
What's that?

31:01.560 --> 31:03.561
The ring. We canvassed the area

31:03.562 --> 31:05.563
and, uh, found a
pawnshop near Dave's work.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.865
He hit up his foreman
for the money to buy it.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.397
Oh.

31:09.398 --> 31:11.539
Everything I learn
about this guy

31:11.540 --> 31:13.641
makes me like him more.

31:13.642 --> 31:15.643
What I don't get is, what
happened to the ring?

31:15.644 --> 31:17.645
I mean, it's not worth
enough money to kill for.

31:17.646 --> 31:19.577
(Whispers) Ow.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.579
You know, the last time
that your hands bothered you,

31:21.580 --> 31:24.452
you were calling
Lacey about lunch.

31:24.453 --> 31:27.355
Paresthesia is not
psychosomatic. Stress is.

31:27.356 --> 31:28.556
I'm not stressed.

31:28.557 --> 31:30.588
Then how was lunch? It was fine!

31:30.589 --> 31:34.522
Sounds stressed. Why do you wanna
know? Uh, you wanna give me more advice?

31:34.523 --> 31:37.465
I'm stressed because you
stuck your nose into my business

31:37.466 --> 31:39.467
in the first place.

31:39.468 --> 31:42.530
Well, I'm starting
to regret that myself.

31:42.531 --> 31:45.573
You know, you got great
instincts about the dead, Megan.

31:45.574 --> 31:48.476
But about the living, you suck.

31:48.477 --> 31:51.579
I care about the dead because
they can't speak for themselves.

31:51.580 --> 31:55.313
The living are on their
own. Really? Then explain

31:55.314 --> 31:57.545
rescuing Nina Wheeler
from her creep of a boyfriend.

31:57.546 --> 32:00.648
Somewhere under all the
crap that you're dealing with

32:00.649 --> 32:03.421
is a decent person
and a good mother.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.324
And the only reason that
I put up with it is 'cause

32:06.325 --> 32:09.327
I'm fairly sure that you won't
find her without me. (Laughs)

32:09.328 --> 32:11.459
That is an incredibly
arrogant thing to say.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.602
It doesn't make it not true.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.507
(Sighs)

32:19.508 --> 32:21.539
I blew it with Lacey.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.571
Okay?

32:23.572 --> 32:28.446
She says I smother her.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.448
Lacey wants me to back off.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.451
So back off. She'll come
around when she's ready.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.454
Who's gonna tell her what
she needs to know, huh,

32:36.455 --> 32:39.687
a-about life, about
boys, about everything?

32:39.688 --> 32:42.591
When did I give up that right?

32:44.333 --> 32:46.335
Ahem.

32:48.597 --> 32:51.639
Your d.N.A. Results
from Linda's eyelid.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.342
One set, male.

32:54.343 --> 32:56.545
Now all you need is
someone to match 'em to.

33:10.359 --> 33:12.590
(Pounds on door) Eric
singleton, this is the police.

33:12.591 --> 33:16.465
Open the door. We have a
warrant to search the premises.

33:18.427 --> 33:19.597
(Grunting)

33:19.598 --> 33:22.600
(Man) Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

33:22.601 --> 33:25.633
(Officers shouting indistinctly)

33:25.634 --> 33:27.606
(Morris) Singleton!

33:29.578 --> 33:32.640
(Glass clinks) Ah.

33:32.641 --> 33:34.482
Please...

33:34.483 --> 33:37.716
Give me a reason
notto shoot your ass.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.434
This is what we call
probable cause...

33:56.435 --> 33:58.506
Linda Chapman's
blood on your jacket.

33:58.507 --> 34:02.370
Andthisis what
we call the fat lady.

34:02.371 --> 34:04.512
You know what that
refers to? Your wife?

34:04.513 --> 34:07.375
Brunnhilde,

34:07.376 --> 34:09.417
whose 10-minute Aria
in "gotterdammerung"

34:09.418 --> 34:11.349
ends Wagner's "ring" cycle,

34:11.350 --> 34:13.621
which is particularly apt be...

34:13.622 --> 34:15.723
It's the ring we found
in your apartment.

34:15.724 --> 34:17.725
It's the ring Dave
piaseki bought

34:17.726 --> 34:20.428
to propose to Linda
Chapman with.

34:20.429 --> 34:24.532
It's the ring you took from
the scene after you shot them.

34:24.533 --> 34:27.365
I didn't shoot anybody.
Sure you didn't.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.497
This ring just magically
appeared in your apartment.

34:29.498 --> 34:33.371
No, I took the ring, but
I didn't shoot anybody.

34:33.372 --> 34:35.373
They were already dead.

34:35.374 --> 34:37.405
(Sam) So how'd you
know where to find 'em?

34:37.406 --> 34:39.547
That's what we were
hasslin' them about.

34:39.548 --> 34:42.580
They were talking
about valley green,

34:42.581 --> 34:44.382
the old days.

34:44.383 --> 34:47.555
Blah, blah, blah.

34:47.556 --> 34:49.457
It made me sick.

34:49.458 --> 34:51.519
So you popped them
and closed her eyes.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.622
What happened? You
got a pang of remorse?

34:54.623 --> 34:56.624
Couldn't take a black chick

34:56.625 --> 34:59.527
eyeing you from beyond
the grave? (Chuckles)

34:59.528 --> 35:02.400
We match your
d.N.A., you're cooked.

35:02.401 --> 35:06.374
Since I didn't do it,
you won't find anything.

35:06.375 --> 35:09.537
(Chuckles)

35:09.538 --> 35:11.439
But you believe me,

35:11.440 --> 35:13.541
if ididdo it,

35:13.542 --> 35:15.543
she'd have been lying
there with her eyes open,

35:15.544 --> 35:18.416
watching me laugh,

35:18.417 --> 35:21.549
not crying tears of remorse.

35:21.550 --> 35:23.591
Tears.

35:23.592 --> 35:25.654
Of course.

35:27.526 --> 35:30.729
(Whirs)

35:35.664 --> 35:37.405
Well?

35:37.406 --> 35:41.509
You can tell the chapmans
they can come get their daughter.

35:41.510 --> 35:43.712
Please come in.

35:47.516 --> 35:50.548
You've met Dr. Hunt already.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.550
This is our investigator,
Peter dunlop,

35:52.551 --> 35:55.523
and these are detectives
Morris and baker.

35:55.524 --> 35:58.626
I-Is there a
breakthrough in the case?

35:58.627 --> 36:01.659
I know what happened
to your daughter.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.432
Mrs. Chapman, I think
you might wanna sit down.

36:04.433 --> 36:06.594
You gonna tell me
something worse

36:06.595 --> 36:09.538
than my daughter was
murdered? I'm afraid so.

36:15.544 --> 36:16.704
(Megan clears throat)

36:16.705 --> 36:20.678
Linda was wearing eye shadow
on the night she was killed.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.780
That eye shadow became smudged

36:22.781 --> 36:24.782
because the
killer's final gesture

36:24.783 --> 36:26.784
was to close her eyes.

36:26.785 --> 36:30.418
Would Brian hall
do that? Doubtful.

36:30.419 --> 36:32.420
Would Eric singleton?

36:32.421 --> 36:34.562
Never.

36:34.563 --> 36:37.625
The killer loved Linda

36:37.626 --> 36:39.628
because Linda was his daughter.

36:42.431 --> 36:44.472
But that's impossible.

36:44.473 --> 36:46.634
The human body
sheds cells all the time.

36:46.635 --> 36:49.537
Hair, skin, even
tears have cells

36:49.538 --> 36:51.780
that we can retrieve
and analyze for d.N.A.

36:54.483 --> 36:59.418
Do you wanna tell us what
happened, Mr. Chapman?

37:03.422 --> 37:07.555
Okay, I'll help you.

37:07.556 --> 37:10.498
It was a big day for Dave.

37:10.499 --> 37:12.500
(Megan) He'd stood
up to Brian hall.

37:12.501 --> 37:14.762
He had borrowed money to buy a
ring. I know we've been through a lot.

37:14.763 --> 37:16.804
(Speaks indistinctly) He'd
done the honorable thing

37:16.805 --> 37:19.507
and asked you both for
Linda's hand. Will you marry me?

37:19.508 --> 37:21.639
I doubt that he
thought you'd say yes,

37:21.640 --> 37:23.771
and I doubt that you thought
saying no would stop him.

37:23.772 --> 37:26.514
(Laughs) Yes!

37:26.515 --> 37:27.815
Yes! Yes!

37:27.816 --> 37:30.778
That's why you
brought a gun along...

37:30.779 --> 37:32.780
Because you knew Dave
wasn't the kind of guy

37:32.781 --> 37:35.653
to back off from a
fight. (Gun cocks)

37:35.654 --> 37:37.655
This is despicable.
How can you even think

37:37.656 --> 37:39.657
my husband could
do such a thing?

37:39.658 --> 37:43.432
We're leaving right now.
Are you, Mr. Chapman?

37:45.564 --> 37:47.665
Mrs. Chapman,

37:47.666 --> 37:52.640
did Dave mention valley green
when he came to your house?

37:52.641 --> 37:55.603
Oh, god.

37:55.604 --> 37:57.705
Al, it's not true, is it?

37:57.706 --> 38:00.678
That's where your
husband found them.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.611
I don't think you
meant to do any harm.

38:03.612 --> 38:06.714
I think you just wanted to
scare Dave off once and for all.

38:06.715 --> 38:10.618
But it all went terribly
wrong, didn't it?

38:10.619 --> 38:12.590
What happened?

38:12.591 --> 38:16.495
Did he startle you?
Did he grab for the gun?

38:18.797 --> 38:20.798
(Mrs. Chapman
gasps) It was Linda.

38:20.799 --> 38:24.502
Oh.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.804
Uh, she, uh...

38:26.805 --> 38:29.737
She started blaming me for
interfering again... (Mrs. Chapman cries)

38:29.738 --> 38:32.510
Just like high school.

38:32.511 --> 38:35.583
Don't do this, Linda.
Dad?! What the hell?! Dad!

38:35.584 --> 38:37.715
You cannot marry him. (Mr. Chapman)
And when Dave opened the door...

38:37.716 --> 38:40.588
(Gunshot) The gun just went off.

38:40.589 --> 38:42.590
(Dave) Linda! Linda!
(Megan) And when you realized

38:42.591 --> 38:44.822
that you'd just shot
your own daughter,

38:44.823 --> 38:47.795
you ran around to
her side of the car.

38:47.796 --> 38:50.798
It must have devastated you

38:50.799 --> 38:52.830
to see her like that...
What did you do?

38:52.831 --> 38:55.633
Get back! And
filled you with rage,

38:55.634 --> 38:57.705
knowing that it was all Dave's
fault. This is all your fault.

38:57.706 --> 38:59.807
So you shot him. No!
No, please! Don't do it!

38:59.808 --> 39:03.471
(Gunshot)

39:03.472 --> 39:05.743
(Mrs. Chapman crying)
Panic impairs judgment.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.616
You thought you'd make it
look like a murder-suicide,

39:08.617 --> 39:11.579
so you wiped your
prints off the gun,

39:11.580 --> 39:14.822
then you put the gun
in Dave's right hand

39:14.823 --> 39:18.527
and used his finger
to pull the trigger.

39:22.561 --> 39:23.691
(Gunshot)

39:23.692 --> 39:26.635
But you put the gun
in the wrong hand.

39:29.738 --> 39:32.570
You were crying.

39:32.571 --> 39:34.742
You wiped your tears.

39:34.743 --> 39:36.744
But before you could
leave your daughter,

39:36.745 --> 39:40.478
you reached out
and closed her eyes,

39:40.479 --> 39:42.610
leaving your d.N.A.

39:42.611 --> 39:45.614
(Sobbing)

39:47.656 --> 39:51.559
You've been crying
a lot, Mr. Chapman.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.561
You were crying two days ago

39:53.562 --> 39:56.864
when you held Linda's
identification form.

39:56.865 --> 40:00.598
The cells that I
retrieved from that form

40:00.599 --> 40:03.501
match the cells
on Linda's eyelids.

40:03.502 --> 40:06.505
(Mrs. Chapman continues crying)

40:12.881 --> 40:15.643
(Exhales deeply)

40:15.644 --> 40:18.787
(Whispers) Oh, my...

40:22.821 --> 40:26.494
She was my baby girl.
Oh, my god. (Sobbing)

40:26.495 --> 40:30.559
I-I taught her
how to walk again.

40:33.502 --> 40:35.603
I would never hurt
her. You know that.

40:35.604 --> 40:39.707
(Continues sobbing)

40:39.708 --> 40:42.710
Oh, please help me. (Sobbing)

40:42.711 --> 40:45.643
(Door opens) Oh, god,

40:45.644 --> 40:48.746
please help me.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.850
(Continues sobbing)

41:03.792 --> 41:06.795
He loved his daughter
so much, he killed her.

41:15.504 --> 41:18.707
(The radio dept.'S
"domestic scene" playing)

41:24.883 --> 41:27.516
