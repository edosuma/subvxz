00:01.088 --> 00:01.653
Previously on
"Billy The Kid"...

00:03.786 --> 00:06.354
Feel real sorry
for your loss, Mrs. McCarty.

00:06.484 --> 00:08.356
Gonna need a man
to look after you.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.792
Come on! I got her!

00:09.922 --> 00:11.837
-Get away from her!
-Give me that gun!

00:11.968 --> 00:13.926
-No.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.407
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name's Henry Antrim.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.672
There are great forces
at work here in the West,

00:20.803 --> 00:23.066
determined to bring
the rule of law

00:23.197 --> 00:26.287
and a God-fearing justice
to all the people who live here.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.031
He's lying to you...
about everything.

00:31.161 --> 00:33.642
Then let's go play some Monte.
Fill our pockets.

00:33.772 --> 00:37.515
I don't lose, not to this
fucking lousy Mexican.

00:39.169 --> 00:40.866
The Santa Fe ring
run most things out here

00:40.997 --> 00:42.607
in the West, Billy.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.045
I just want justice
for my friend.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.873
Hattie, I just want to know
who did this to you.

00:48.004 --> 00:51.573
Antrim. He's one
of my regular customers.

00:53.575 --> 00:54.706
If it isn't the kid!

00:57.622 --> 00:59.624
Seems I'm more in debt
than I thought.

00:59.755 --> 01:00.930
We have to get away
from this place.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.845
-And go where?!
-I don't know!

01:02.975 --> 01:04.455
You don't have
to stay with him.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.631
I do. And I married him
under God.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.633
Apart from the mines,
there are big cattle herds

01:08.764 --> 01:10.635
and open ranges
all over the county.

01:10.766 --> 01:13.421
You can be anything
you wanna be.

01:13.551 --> 01:14.770
I own your mother.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.902
Cross me one more time,

01:17.033 --> 01:19.383
and all of you will suffer.

01:19.514 --> 01:20.645
It's a fuckin' snake!

01:49.718 --> 01:51.676
You go up, and I'll set
the loading material.

01:51.807 --> 01:52.895
All right.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.615
Okay!

02:30.062 --> 02:31.542
You hear the fuse spit?

02:31.673 --> 02:34.023
No.

02:34.154 --> 02:38.462
Fuck the hell! Get in there
and see if it went out!

03:28.599 --> 03:29.948
Norm?

04:14.079 --> 04:15.733
The fuse must've spit,
and neither of us heard it.

04:15.864 --> 04:18.040
Jesus Christ.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.998
Poor Norm.

04:20.129 --> 04:25.003
Poor Norm? What about me?
Nearly lost my eye.

04:25.134 --> 04:27.136
And I think this arm is broken.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.922
Huh. I am done with mining.
It's too dangerous.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.316
I spoke with Dr. Casson.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.753
He said they pulled a rock outta
Norm's eye the size of an egg.

04:35.884 --> 04:38.060
Mm! Yeah!

04:38.190 --> 04:39.757
Well, you just
pick up my hat there.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.588
That's it.
Yeah, feel around the rim.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.721
Yeah. See?

04:46.851 --> 04:49.071
My head had been
one inch the other way,

04:49.201 --> 04:51.856
and I'd be dead, too.
You gotta be smart.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.902
You gotta know when
to get out of things.

04:54.032 --> 04:56.861
Mining's just not for me.
Oh, it never was.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.820
Why you get educated

04:58.950 --> 05:02.998
only to end up digging the earth
like some, some animal?

05:03.128 --> 05:05.696
I think right now you just
need to get some sleep.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.176
And in the morning,
we can talk about

05:07.307 --> 05:10.962
what kind of job you might
be able to do instead.

05:11.093 --> 05:13.748
Wife, I just fucking
nearly died,

05:13.878 --> 05:17.273
and you're talkin' to me
about gettin' a new job?

05:17.404 --> 05:19.971
Henry, we could only afford
to borrow the money

05:20.102 --> 05:23.801
to buy this house
because both of us have jobs.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.107
Heartless bitch.

05:34.812 --> 05:35.944
Billy, please.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.782
I'm going out.

05:47.912 --> 05:50.001
See if I can make
some money on cards.

05:50.132 --> 05:54.397
Good luck, Billy.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.573
Shame his head hadn't have
been an inch the other way.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.718
He never shows me
no fucking respect.

07:02.552 --> 07:05.990
Two players remain.
Gentlemen, the showdown.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.184
Gentlemen,
show your cards, please.

08:49.267 --> 08:54.838
Four threes wins.
Thank you, gentlemen.

09:35.096 --> 09:37.968
Hey, Billy.
Hold up there.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.408
Sorry I took all your savings.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.933
Just got lucky.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.456
Hey, what are you
doing later today?

09:47.587 --> 09:52.592
You, uh, wanna do
some practicing?

09:52.722 --> 09:56.073
I don't know, Jesse.
I'll bring the Winchester.

09:56.204 --> 10:02.166
Okay.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.168
Later, kid.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.096
Morning.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.407
Hey, Ma.

10:25.537 --> 10:28.976
Hi, Billy.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.368
Here, let me.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.283
Thank you.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.072
Hello there, Kathleen.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.118
How's your day going?

10:41.249 --> 10:43.425
Not bad, Mr. Upson.

10:43.555 --> 10:46.384
Always nice to see you.

10:46.515 --> 10:47.516
Ready?

10:47.647 --> 10:51.259
-How do, Billy?
-Mr. Upson.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.477
Any chance I could
get some coffee?

10:52.608 --> 10:54.654
Sure, you can.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.483
So, how are things going?

10:58.614 --> 11:01.573
Keeping busy.

11:01.704 --> 11:05.055
There's no
real work around here.

11:05.186 --> 11:07.405
Nothing regular, anyway.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.277
I lined up at the mines,
but they said

11:09.407 --> 11:11.366
they're not issuing
licenses right now.

11:11.496 --> 11:15.675
-Here you go.
-Ma'am.

11:15.805 --> 11:19.374
You could always join
one of the railway gangs.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.245
That'd take me away
from Ma and Joe.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.073
You know I can't do that.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.513
So, there's a rancher
by the name of Billy Matthews.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.602
He has a big place
just outside of town.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.561
I could try putting
in a good word for you.

11:32.692 --> 11:37.174
How's your investigation going?

11:37.305 --> 11:40.090
Well, there are some people
here in Silver City

11:40.221 --> 11:41.439
who know more
than they're telling.

11:41.570 --> 11:45.182
Some of them are getting
quite nervous.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.492
There you go.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.189
Your mother
works too hard.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.278
Yes.

11:54.409 --> 11:57.107
I'm gonna introduce you
to Matthews.

11:57.238 --> 12:00.502
Thank you.

12:14.559 --> 12:18.520
Not bad, young'un.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.391
You ever do
any work on that gun?

12:20.522 --> 12:22.480
How'd you mean?

12:22.611 --> 12:25.353
You could have
the trigger tightened.

12:25.483 --> 12:28.051
Like mine, see?

12:28.182 --> 12:29.705
What does that do?

12:29.836 --> 12:33.535
It's not a hair trigger
but, uh...

12:33.665 --> 12:36.494
it's close.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.105
You got to know
what you're doing, though.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.546
It goes off so easy.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.683
Hey, Jesse.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.469
How do you, uh,
earn a living?

12:54.599 --> 12:56.688
I mean, aside
from playing poker.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.734
Well, I help people out,
piecemeal;

12:58.865 --> 13:01.084
moving timber,
helping build cabins.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.347
And, uh...

13:03.478 --> 13:06.089
do a few things
kind of-on the side,

13:06.220 --> 13:08.135
you might say.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.354
What kinda things?

13:10.485 --> 13:13.314
I do a little cattle rustling.

13:13.444 --> 13:16.578
There are some guys in town
I know who are into it.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.449
There's plenty of cattle
out there on the ranges.

13:18.580 --> 13:23.280
Don't really hurt no one.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.066
You wanna come try?

13:26.196 --> 13:28.503
Naw.

13:28.633 --> 13:33.247
Hey, I got--
I got something for you.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.603
For me?

13:41.733 --> 13:43.735
Jesse, this is your gun.

13:43.866 --> 13:47.043
I bought a new one
with my winnings.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.350
See?

13:49.480 --> 13:52.222
Figured I probably
owed you one.

13:52.353 --> 13:55.095
Thank you, Jesse.

13:57.488 --> 13:58.707
See that rail post?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.709
Yeah, I see it.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.452
You reckon you could hit it?

14:04.582 --> 14:07.150
Maybe.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.109
Go on, then.

14:20.207 --> 14:20.860
Whoo!

14:36.005 --> 14:42.446
Kid, I reckon there's not much
I can teach you after all.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.569
Ma?

15:18.700 --> 15:20.223
What are you doing?

15:21.877 --> 15:23.705
Just putting aside
some of our savings, Billy,

15:23.835 --> 15:26.360
I don't want Antrim
to know about.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.144
Where is Antrim?

15:45.074 --> 15:46.641
Tomorrow I'm goin' to speak
to a rancher

15:46.771 --> 15:50.427
called Billy Matthews,
ask him about a job.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.603
Mr. Upson says
he'll give me a reference.

15:52.734 --> 15:56.694
So, I can work the range,
play the saloons.

15:56.825 --> 16:01.612
We'll have plenty of money.

16:01.743 --> 16:05.660
How would we manage
without you, Billy?

16:05.790 --> 16:10.926
I'm doing this for you, Ma.
We can't depend on Antrim.

16:11.057 --> 16:14.582
-I know you think I'm foolish.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.540
But I still believe
people can change.

16:16.671 --> 16:19.500
I have to believe that.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.290
Billy.

16:30.815 --> 16:35.516
Please promise me
that you'll never hurt Antrim.

16:35.646 --> 16:39.911
For your sake, Billy, not his.

16:40.042 --> 16:43.306
You know what they do
to people who...

17:19.690 --> 17:22.867
You okay, Little?

17:22.998 --> 17:25.827
How are you feeling?

17:27.437 --> 17:28.830
Not well.

17:34.836 --> 17:37.273
I'll get Dr. Casson over to see
about that cough tomorrow.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.799
Hey.

17:41.930 --> 17:45.455
Come here.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.327
Come on.

18:13.222 --> 18:18.532
"The city sleeps,
and the country sleeps.

18:18.662 --> 18:21.448
The living sleep
for their time,

18:21.578 --> 18:24.799
the dead sleep for their time.

18:24.929 --> 18:28.803
The old husband sleeps
by his wife.

18:28.933 --> 18:32.720
And the young husband
sleeps by his wife.

18:32.850 --> 18:36.419
And these tend inward
to me,

18:36.550 --> 18:40.815
and I tend outward to them.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.470
And such as it is
to be of these,

18:43.600 --> 18:46.777
more or less I am.

18:46.908 --> 18:49.606
And of these one and all,

18:49.737 --> 18:55.917
I weave the song of myself.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.427
Whoa!

19:28.776 --> 19:31.474
Whoa.

19:41.745 --> 19:44.008
Mr. Matthews.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.923
This the one, Mr. Upson?

19:46.054 --> 19:47.577
Yes, sir.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.710
Don't look more than a boy.

19:49.840 --> 19:54.671
Can't help but wonder why you
think I should hire a kid.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.586
Billy, sir.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.980
-Billy what?
-Antrim. Billy Antrim.

19:59.110 --> 20:01.852
Yeah.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.941
You know, bein'
a cowboy's a hard life.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.770
Yes, sir.

20:06.901 --> 20:10.557
-You ride a horse?
-Yes, sir.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.950
Use a lasso? Fire a gun?

20:13.081 --> 20:16.606
Sleep on your own?

20:16.737 --> 20:17.781
Yes, sir.

20:19.174 --> 20:23.091
Well, we'll see.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.878
Now, this cowboy's gonna
show you how it's done.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.750
Once he's finished,

20:29.880 --> 20:33.623
all you got to do
is the same thing.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.887
-You got that?
-Yes, sir.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.065
Yes! Yeah! Yeah!

20:41.196 --> 20:44.547
All right. Now you git 'em, boy.

21:22.193 --> 21:23.673
Come on, Billy.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.868
Hell, I seen enough.
He ain't no cowboy.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.914
Come on, Matthews.
Give the kid a chance.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.829
What the hell
you think I just did?

21:48.959 --> 21:51.614
You see that he can do it.
He just needs a little practice.

21:53.442 --> 21:56.140
Well, we don't pay for practice
around here, Mr. Upson.

21:56.271 --> 21:59.100
And we don't need any publicity,

21:59.230 --> 22:03.104
especially
from the likes of you.

22:03.234 --> 22:05.324
-Come on, hold on!
-Goddamn it!

22:05.454 --> 22:07.935
I'm sorry, Mr. Upson.
I could've done better.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.720
No, I'm not upset
with you, Billy.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.070
Matthews is
in with the Santa Fe ring.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.595
He clearly knows
that I'm investigating

22:15.725 --> 22:17.031
how it operates.

22:17.161 --> 22:18.859
He was never gonna
give you a job

22:18.989 --> 22:22.210
just so I could find out more.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.734
That wasn't about you, Billy.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.650
That was him
sending me a message.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.870
Well...

22:30.000 --> 22:32.742
He sent me a pretty
clear message too, Mr. Upson.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.853
How is he?

22:56.984 --> 22:58.986
Your son is suffering
from consumption.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.906
Is he gonna die?

23:06.036 --> 23:08.082
Is my son gonna die?

23:08.212 --> 23:11.694
Younger patients have a much
better chance of surviving.

23:14.349 --> 23:15.916
I wish you good day.

23:29.146 --> 23:33.107
Hello. Hey.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.762
You're gonna be fine, Joe.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.112
All right.
No, I've done it before.

23:38.242 --> 23:40.201
So, let me see it.

23:40.331 --> 23:43.770
See this line here?
So that, that's your life line.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.380
That's, uh,

23:45.511 --> 23:48.209
that's gonna tell everybody
how long you'll live.

23:48.339 --> 23:52.082
That means that you'll probably
live to an old lady. Old age.

23:52.213 --> 23:55.129
And if you're lucky...

23:55.259 --> 23:59.089
This is my friend, Billy.

23:59.220 --> 24:02.919
Get lost, will ya? Go on.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.056
You got a girl, Billy?

24:09.186 --> 24:10.753
No.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.233
No time for that.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.061
Mm.

24:14.191 --> 24:16.280
Oh, I like them, all right.

24:16.411 --> 24:20.067
Not so much to talk to,
I just like riding 'em.

24:23.897 --> 24:24.941
So, how is everything?

24:25.072 --> 24:26.813
Pretty good.

24:26.943 --> 24:28.423
Goin' out with the boys soon,

24:28.554 --> 24:31.470
do a little rustling,
make some good money.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.129
What?

24:39.260 --> 24:40.304
Are you good?

24:40.435 --> 24:42.785
My brother's sick.

24:42.916 --> 24:45.440
It's consumption.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.747
Someone's gonna need
to pay the doctor.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.096
I know.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.185
If it takes a long time
to cure...

24:51.315 --> 24:54.884
-I know, I know.
-You got no money?

24:58.975 --> 25:00.368
Why don't you come out with us?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.849
And you can make
some real money.

25:02.979 --> 25:06.896
-I can't.
-Sure, you can.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.811
I can't.

25:08.942 --> 25:11.118
It ain't right.

25:11.248 --> 25:13.512
Yeah?

25:13.642 --> 25:17.211
You know the herd
that we're gonna steal from?

25:17.341 --> 25:19.430
It's Billy Matthews' herd.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.998
He ain't got one ounce
of Christian religion

25:22.129 --> 25:24.087
inside of him.

25:24.218 --> 25:28.352
That cripple--
he pays his cowboys jack shit.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.311
He cheats on everyone.

25:30.441 --> 25:35.055
And you don't
owe him nothin'. Do ya?

25:37.971 --> 25:40.364
Listen. I'll...

25:40.495 --> 25:43.324
I'll take care of you.

25:43.454 --> 25:45.326
Man, it's real easy.

25:45.456 --> 25:47.546
We just run some of Matthews'
cattle off the range.

25:47.676 --> 25:50.200
He's got so many,
he ain't gonna miss just a few.

25:50.331 --> 25:55.902
Then you pay that doctor
for your little brother.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.121
Come on, man. What do you say?

26:12.396 --> 26:15.356
You have to watch out
for Matthews' cowboys.

26:15.486 --> 26:19.969
That's really the only thing.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.277
Here's the boy
I was telling you about.

26:23.407 --> 26:28.456
I call him... Kid Antrim.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.894
He's okay.
I'll vouch for him.

26:32.025 --> 26:33.374
Your call, Jesse.

26:33.504 --> 26:36.159
Stay close to Jesse, kid.
And if you get spotted,

26:36.290 --> 26:37.596
we don't fight, we run.

26:37.726 --> 26:40.860
You get shot, that's your own
bad ass luck.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.252
Let's go.

26:45.691 --> 26:48.607
Let's go get 'em, boys!
Get 'em up! Get 'em up!

26:48.737 --> 26:51.261
-Come on, let's get 'em up!

26:51.392 --> 26:52.959
-Whoo!
-Go get 'em, boys!

26:56.615 --> 26:59.313
Come on, Kid! Yah, yah, yah!

27:02.229 --> 27:06.407
Yah, yah, yah!

27:06.537 --> 27:09.410
Get 'em, boys!
Yup, yup! Come on!

27:09.540 --> 27:11.194
Come on! Yup, yup,
yup, yup, yup!

27:11.325 --> 27:13.240
Whoo! Come on, Billy!
This way!

27:13.370 --> 27:14.937
Yah!

27:17.200 --> 27:19.986
Yah!

27:20.116 --> 27:21.422
Yah, yah!

27:27.297 --> 27:30.997
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

27:31.127 --> 27:32.433
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

27:39.309 --> 27:42.399
Yup! Yup! Yup! Yup! Yup! Yah!

27:46.099 --> 27:49.319
Yup! Yup! Yup! Yup! Yah!

27:55.325 --> 27:57.023
How was that, Billy?

27:59.590 --> 28:01.114
Come on.

28:53.601 --> 28:57.300
I'm so sorry for your loss,
Kathleen.

28:57.431 --> 29:01.130
My poor boy.

29:01.261 --> 29:03.263
I guess it was his time to go.

29:05.526 --> 29:09.312
God called to him.

29:09.443 --> 29:13.012
He was so very young.

29:13.142 --> 29:15.405
Yes.

29:18.582 --> 29:22.282
He never had much of a life.

29:22.412 --> 29:25.415
And that's the truth.

29:25.546 --> 29:27.504
It's okay, Ma.

29:27.635 --> 29:32.727
He's with Pa now, in heaven.

29:32.858 --> 29:36.165
If I could do anything
for you, Kathleen...

29:36.296 --> 29:39.168
you know I would.

29:42.650 --> 29:46.306
Very kind of you.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.612
But you can't do anything,

29:48.743 --> 29:51.441
and I wouldn't want you to.

29:53.617 --> 29:57.099
My life is in God's hands,

29:57.230 --> 29:59.058
and I can't change that.

30:06.543 --> 30:09.111
Yeah.

30:24.387 --> 30:27.260
Come on.

30:38.358 --> 30:39.489
I came to pay my respects.

30:39.620 --> 30:42.710
What respects?

30:42.841 --> 30:45.844
You're too late, Henry.
He's already in the ground.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.585
-He's still my son.
-He's not your son!

30:48.716 --> 30:50.587
You never did anything for him!

30:50.718 --> 30:52.763
You probably never even
knew he was alive.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.157
Come now, Kathleen.
I'm your husband.

30:59.945 --> 31:02.512
I want to make things right,
Kathleen.

31:02.643 --> 31:05.646
I want us to be
a family again.

31:05.776 --> 31:09.345
I want to prove to you
that I've changed.

31:09.476 --> 31:12.609
I've prayed to the Lord,
and He has heard me.

31:12.740 --> 31:19.355
I intend to be
a good husband to you.

32:39.522 --> 32:41.698
So, you caught me.

32:41.829 --> 32:44.701
This is my money.

32:44.832 --> 32:46.616
You haven't earned any of it.

32:46.747 --> 32:49.489
Not a fucking penny!

32:49.619 --> 32:53.667
You pay for drink.
Pay for whores.

32:53.797 --> 32:54.929
You cheat on my mother.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.452
And now you fucking
steal from her.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.541
I got no choice.

32:58.672 --> 32:59.978
Sure you have.

33:00.108 --> 33:02.545
You coulda been a good man
like my father.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.417
Oh, yeah.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.332
And your father was such
a good man.

33:06.462 --> 33:07.550
He skipped out on life.

33:07.681 --> 33:09.813
Ah! What, you gonna shoot me?

33:09.944 --> 33:11.467
You deserve it!

33:15.515 --> 33:17.647
I know how much
you hate me, Billy.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.781
I told lies all my life!

33:20.911 --> 33:22.739
Thing is,

33:22.870 --> 33:26.482
all I ever wanted to be
was respected.

33:26.613 --> 33:28.441
I wanted to be admired.

33:28.571 --> 33:31.792
A true gentleman.

33:31.922 --> 33:35.839
The first time I saw you
and your mother I thought,

33:35.970 --> 33:38.581
if I can marry her...

33:38.712 --> 33:41.497
I thought I would
turn into a... a good man.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.849
Because your mother...

33:45.980 --> 33:47.677
is such a good woman.

33:47.808 --> 33:51.507
I really had
those thoughts, Billy.

33:53.857 --> 33:57.426
-Sure you did.
-Yeah.

33:57.557 --> 34:00.908
It's just a shame
you couldn't do it.

34:01.039 --> 34:04.607
I really hate myself, Billy.

34:04.738 --> 34:08.655
I always have.

34:58.008 --> 35:01.360
It's good to sit with you.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.756
Everything that's happened...

35:06.887 --> 35:09.759
do you think
it's been worth it?

35:09.890 --> 35:12.545
Did we have any choice?

35:16.940 --> 35:19.856
I don't want to bring God
into this.

35:19.987 --> 35:23.773
Can if you want.

35:23.904 --> 35:27.690
Then, no, I don't think
we have a choice.

35:33.609 --> 35:39.049
God works in
a mysterious way, Billy.

35:39.180 --> 35:42.749
And do you know
what else I believe?

35:42.879 --> 35:47.623
A wise woman
said it a long time ago,

35:47.754 --> 35:49.451
because she knew.

35:49.582 --> 35:52.454
And she said...

35:52.585 --> 35:55.849
"And all shall be well,

35:55.979 --> 35:58.808
and all shall be well,

35:58.939 --> 36:03.813
and all manner
of things shall be well."

36:25.661 --> 36:27.837
Billy, it's your mom!

36:35.758 --> 36:36.803
Move!

36:38.674 --> 36:41.373
Move!

36:48.771 --> 36:52.122
What is it?

36:52.253 --> 36:54.473
It's the same disease
that carried away your brother.

36:54.603 --> 36:57.650
I'm sorry.

36:57.780 --> 37:01.958
-Ma?
-Billy?

37:02.089 --> 37:06.485
Ma. Hey.

37:18.148 --> 37:19.889
Billy?

37:26.766 --> 37:28.681
Yes, Ma?

37:30.770 --> 37:32.902
I'm not ready to go yet.

37:35.035 --> 37:39.648
I know Ma.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.041
I won't allow it.

37:47.047 --> 37:50.006
You're so funny.

37:50.137 --> 37:53.662
-No. I mean it.

37:53.793 --> 37:56.883
I mean...

37:57.013 --> 38:03.150
I already lost Pa and Joe.

38:03.281 --> 38:07.937
I can't afford to lose you too.

38:37.271 --> 38:40.579
It's okay, Ma.

38:48.761 --> 38:50.589
I have to go, Billy.

38:52.852 --> 38:59.685
And you, you have to let me.

39:04.777 --> 39:07.693
I can't bear this.

39:07.823 --> 39:10.870
You can bear anything, Billy.

39:13.351 --> 39:18.660
I've looked in your soul,

39:18.791 --> 39:27.800
and I know how good you are.

39:29.367 --> 39:36.199
You know,
you know I believe.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.855
You know I believe
I'll see your father...

39:39.986 --> 39:43.772
and Joe.

39:43.903 --> 39:48.777
I'm not afraid.

39:48.908 --> 39:50.866
Oh, Ma.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.570
I love you, Billy.

40:04.053 --> 40:08.101
I love you with all my heart.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.672
I love you too, Ma.

41:17.953 --> 41:19.912
Ma?

41:24.873 --> 41:27.006
Ma.

42:46.302 --> 42:49.131
I'm really sorry, Billy.

42:49.262 --> 42:51.394
Yeah.

42:51.525 --> 42:53.266
You don't know, man.

42:53.396 --> 42:55.268
I found my old man dead.

42:55.398 --> 42:57.966
He blew his brains out.

42:58.097 --> 42:59.489
I know just what
you're going through.

42:59.620 --> 43:03.363
First thing,
you gotta get money.

43:03.493 --> 43:07.976
-You're broke, right?
-Yeah, I guess.

43:08.107 --> 43:10.979
What?

43:14.026 --> 43:14.983
Chinese laundry?

43:15.114 --> 43:17.159
Yup.

43:17.290 --> 43:19.379
They do good business.

43:19.509 --> 43:23.078
All them Chinamen working
on the railroad.

43:23.209 --> 43:26.429
Figure it's pretty easy
to get in, get out.

43:26.560 --> 43:29.955
There's a door round the back,
nothing around it.

43:30.085 --> 43:31.783
What the hell?
They're Chinese.

43:33.523 --> 43:36.004
You in?

43:41.096 --> 43:43.055
When?

43:43.185 --> 43:44.796
Tonight.

44:31.103 --> 44:33.061
Drawer's over here.

45:01.437 --> 45:03.091
Aw, shit!

45:03.222 --> 45:05.703
-What?
-The money ain't here.

45:05.833 --> 45:09.358
They probably keep it
under their mattress.

45:09.489 --> 45:12.971
-No, Jesse.
-Just a couple of Chinamen.

45:13.101 --> 45:15.190
You afraid?

45:38.779 --> 45:43.436
Let's just leave it. Come on.
Let's get out of here, Jesse.

45:46.700 --> 45:48.180
Billy, come on! Let's go!

45:50.748 --> 45:52.314
I still have one barrel left.

45:52.445 --> 45:54.360
You want buckshot?

46:04.500 --> 46:08.243
We find the defendant,
William Antrim,

46:08.374 --> 46:11.377
guilty of attempted
burglary and theft

46:11.507 --> 46:14.684
at the said Chinese premises

46:14.815 --> 46:19.515
and sentenced hereby to a total
of three years in jail.

46:19.646 --> 46:22.780
Young as he is,

46:22.910 --> 46:25.608
we hope the defendant will use
his time in confinement

46:25.739 --> 46:27.393
to reflect on his crime,

46:27.523 --> 46:32.093
and when he emerges back
into society,

46:32.224 --> 46:33.573
to commit himself

46:33.703 --> 46:37.316
to more lawful
and productive pursuits.

46:37.446 --> 46:39.231
-Remove the prisoner.

46:39.361 --> 46:42.234
Wait! Don't I get
to say anything?

46:42.364 --> 46:44.192
The sentence is plain unfair.

46:44.323 --> 46:46.368
I didn't steal anything.
I didn't hurt anyone.

46:46.499 --> 46:48.631
-I said, remove the prisoner.

46:48.762 --> 46:54.159
Come on. Let's go.

46:54.289 --> 46:56.248
This is a travesty.

46:56.378 --> 46:58.293
To make a kid pay
for the things I've done?

46:58.424 --> 47:01.122
Shame on you, Judge.

47:04.734 --> 47:06.345
Hands.

48:17.503 --> 48:20.114
Goddamn it.

48:20.245 --> 48:21.637
Antrim?

48:21.768 --> 48:23.552
Antrim!

48:39.829 --> 48:42.571
Give me two minutes.

48:42.702 --> 48:45.705
Don't fuckin' yell,
or I'll come back for you.
