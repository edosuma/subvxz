00:08.051 --> 00:10.836
Calvin, this place is
a real hot spot.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.187
They're known for
their Rosé Lemonades.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.407
Did you order these
for our wives

00:16.451 --> 00:19.236
or is the cast of
Sex and the Cityon the way?

00:19.280 --> 00:21.630
No, Calvin, these are for us.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.197
I had a rough day
at work today.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.155
We are about to get
sorority girl wasted.

00:26.156 --> 00:29.072
Nobody's getting wasted
off this Kool-Aid.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.291
Whoa.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.424
[sorority girl voice]:
Oh, my God.

00:33.468 --> 00:36.340
Take my keys.
I, like, can't drive.

00:38.386 --> 00:39.517
DAVE:
Calvin, look.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.954
It's Jerome Bettis.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.913
He's an NFL legend,
and he's just sitting there

00:43.956 --> 00:46.002
drinking a Rosé Lemonade.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.656
Look at that.

00:47.699 --> 00:50.050
Stars,
they're just like us.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.097
Dave, that is not Jerome Bettis.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.927
Oh, my God, I was right.
That's Jerome Bettis.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.233
I'll be right back.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.497
Jerome Bettis?

01:02.540 --> 01:04.151
My man!

01:04.194 --> 01:05.674
Hey, look.
You don't know me,

01:05.717 --> 01:08.155
but I'm married to your
old friend, Tina Plummer.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.721
Lil' Tee Tee?

01:09.765 --> 01:12.376
Small world!
How is she?

01:12.420 --> 01:14.335
Oh, well,
she's Big Tee Tee now.

01:14.378 --> 01:15.640
[chuckles]

01:15.684 --> 01:16.859
Not... not bigbig.

01:16.902 --> 01:19.949
But old.
But not oldold.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.083
She's fine.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.301
Jerome?

01:24.345 --> 01:25.476
Dave Johnson.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.477
That's on the house.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.392
Looks like we, uh,

01:28.436 --> 01:30.351
all have the same taste buds.

01:30.394 --> 01:33.136
Careful, these lemonades
sneak up on you.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.095
Yeah, but, uh,

01:35.138 --> 01:37.967
athletes like us can
handle our juice, right?

01:39.664 --> 01:42.102
How much you bench? 185?

01:43.320 --> 01:44.930
In the fifth grade.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.367
[elevator bell dings]

01:46.410 --> 01:47.977
Hey, guys.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.196
Jerome?

01:49.239 --> 01:52.590
If it isn't Lil' Tee
Tee from the LBC?

01:52.634 --> 01:54.070
[Tina laughing]

01:54.114 --> 01:55.506
Romy, Romy.

01:55.550 --> 01:56.855
Well, you know
I'm straight out of Compton.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.988
You've seen the movie.Yeah, yeah.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.859
Calvin...

02:00.903 --> 02:02.513
Hey, Gemma.
Dave Johnson.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.167
Kalamazoo born and raised.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.342
Okay.

02:05.386 --> 02:06.474
I guess I'm driving.

02:06.517 --> 02:07.562
Oh, wow.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.912
So, uh, what are you doing here?

02:09.955 --> 02:11.392
Well, I'm in
town on business.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.176
Uh, I've got a shoot over
at the Rose Bowl tomorrow.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.352
Oh.
Oh. You know,
that's by our house.

02:15.396 --> 02:17.789
Tina and I would love for you
to come over for dinner.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.791
Oh, well,
I'm sure Jerome is busy.

02:19.835 --> 02:22.707
Well, actually, I am
free tomorrow night.

02:22.751 --> 02:25.710
You know, room service--
it gets real old, real fast.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.408
Ah.Well, there it is.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.410
Tomorrow night,
it's going down!

02:30.498 --> 02:32.413
Looks like we're
getting on The Bus!

02:32.456 --> 02:35.677
Next stop: Touchdown!

02:39.681 --> 02:42.727
Sorry, but my friend
is sorority girl wasted.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.686
Okay, that's enough for you,
Kelly-Jo.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.253
Come on.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.211
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:48.255 --> 02:49.256
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:55.218 --> 02:58.917
Ooh, Jerome was so cute
in his Geico ad.

02:58.961 --> 03:02.617
Mm, back in the day, I would
have let him bundle my policies.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.793
[laughs]

03:04.836 --> 03:06.186
Aw, why didn't you two date?

03:06.229 --> 03:07.274
Oh, we did.

03:07.317 --> 03:08.449
[gasps]

03:08.492 --> 03:10.015
Every summer

03:10.059 --> 03:12.888
in high school, I would
visit my granny in Detroit.

03:12.931 --> 03:15.238
So I met Jerome
in my senior year,

03:15.282 --> 03:18.502
and, uh, you know, we had
a cute little teenage romance.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.548
Aw. Does Calvin know?

03:20.591 --> 03:23.464
No. I would've told him,
but when we started dating,

03:23.507 --> 03:26.510
he had a "Don't Ask, Leave
the Past in the Past" rule.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.208
Ah.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.687
When we started dating,

03:29.731 --> 03:32.255
Dave had
a "Do Ask, Do Tell" rule.

03:32.299 --> 03:35.084
He even told me his first crush
was Nancy Reagan.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.043
And yet you still married him.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.263
Mm-hmm.

03:40.307 --> 03:43.092
Eventually, though, his honesty
policy grew on me.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.137
He's the ultimate open book.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.965
He'll tell anybody anything.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.053
Hmm.
Watch.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.447
Dave?

03:50.491 --> 03:51.666
Yes, sweetie?

03:51.709 --> 03:53.276
How many people
have you slept with?

03:53.320 --> 03:54.669
Six.
Three.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.281
Six? You told me
it was three.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.456
Did I?

03:59.500 --> 04:02.459
Wait, did you lie
about your number?

04:02.503 --> 04:04.331
Hmm.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.723
[high voice]:
Did I?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.684
That's the same
voice you had

04:09.727 --> 04:12.687
when I asked you if you
dinged my car last week.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.079
[higher voice]:
Is it?

04:14.123 --> 04:16.212
BOTH:
Yes, it is.

04:20.347 --> 04:23.306
All right, you got it,
little man?Yeah, I got it.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.700
I said, you got it, little man?Yeah, I got it!

04:25.743 --> 04:27.702
All right.
One, two, three.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.617
[groans]Yeah, I don't got it.

04:29.660 --> 04:30.879
D'oh!

04:32.228 --> 04:33.316
Hey, Marty, how come you're not

04:33.360 --> 04:34.404
helping us get ready
for Poker Night?

04:34.448 --> 04:35.840
Well, I am, man.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.581
I'm busy making snacks.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.975
Uh, yeah, that'll be
three large pizzas.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.411
Ooh, and some
mozzarella sticks.

04:41.455 --> 04:44.196
Okay, yeah, and-and two dozen
mozzarella sticks.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.981
Yeah, Malcolm,
give me your debit card.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.417
What?

04:47.461 --> 04:49.332
I didn't budget
for no damn mozzarella sticks.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.336
And yet you got enough money
in your budget

04:53.380 --> 04:54.816
for a Captain Kirk Snuggie.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.339
It was a collector's edition.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.645
That's an investment.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.171
Man, playing poker is
so much more funner

05:02.214 --> 05:03.651
than doing my English homework.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.348
More funner?

05:05.392 --> 05:06.828
Yeah, you might want
to try "more harder"

05:06.871 --> 05:08.090
on that homework, brother.

05:09.744 --> 05:10.962
And, yeah, uh, listen.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.921
We appreciate you
helping us set up,

05:12.964 --> 05:14.444
but tonight's for adults only.

05:14.488 --> 05:15.967
I'm sorry, Grover.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.491
Aw, come on.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.580
We got mozzarella sticks coming.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.973
Ooh. Hey, you know what?
I'll save you some.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.453
Fine.

05:23.497 --> 05:26.064
Didn't want to come
to your awesome party anyway.

05:29.677 --> 05:30.982
Look, oh, well.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.462
These poker nights can get
kind of wild, Marty.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.464
It's no place for kids.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.205
And maybe not for you, either.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.338
Yeah.
Last time, you lost $100.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.557
Yeah, but this time,
I'm prepared.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.167
I've created a foolproof system

05:42.211 --> 05:44.344
that calculates the odds
by running every permutation

05:44.387 --> 05:48.260
of any given hand to create
an advantage in my favor.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.784
So, you're counting cards?

05:49.827 --> 05:51.394
Yeah, basically.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.918
[knocking at door][grunts]

so I brought her.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.059
No, I brought you.

06:04.102 --> 06:05.190
I'm the one
with the car.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.453
Oh.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.019
Why are you always telling
family business?

06:08.063 --> 06:09.194
Why you always broke?

06:09.238 --> 06:11.109
[laughing]

06:11.153 --> 06:12.546
[mutters]Okay.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.069
Well, I got to warn you,
Whitney,

06:14.112 --> 06:16.158
I have a math-based system
that tells me

06:16.201 --> 06:17.420
there's an 86% chance

06:17.464 --> 06:19.074
that I'm going to take
93% of your money.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.772
Well, I have a system that
tells me you're 100% corny.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.644
What?It's called my eyes.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.083
I like her. Yeah, she can stay.

a lot more comfortable

the only baller in the house.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.579
[chuckling]

06:45.622 --> 06:47.102
Well, I guess

06:47.145 --> 06:50.018
everyone can reach
around your trophy

06:50.061 --> 06:51.672
to get to my artichoke dip.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.804
Or we can

06:53.848 --> 06:56.285
just move your
artichoke dip altogether.

06:59.984 --> 07:03.074
Uh, guys, so excited to take
a picture with The Bus

07:03.118 --> 07:04.772
I changed three times.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.905
Huh. Are you sure
it wasn't six times?

07:07.949 --> 07:08.906
[knocking at door]Hmm.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.575
Do I smell artichoke dip?

07:25.619 --> 07:27.098
My man!

07:33.496 --> 07:35.455
Seven.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.370
Just quit, Marty.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.111
You've already lost
all your poker money.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.417
Do not lose your pride.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.027
What? I-- No!
I can't be losing.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.377
I am a damn rocket scientist!

07:45.421 --> 07:47.554
Look, Marty,
there's no shame in quitting.

07:47.597 --> 07:50.078
I do it with jobs
all the time.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.993
I've won five hands.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.168
And you've won zero.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.952
I'm no rocket scientist,

07:54.996 --> 07:56.867
but it sounds like you
need to call Houston.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.261
'Cause you got
a problem.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.523
[chuckles] Okay.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.656
I'll match all your chips.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.048
My debit card.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.572
MALCOLM:
Whoa, whoa, wait.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.225
We haven't paid rent yet.
What about your budget?

08:07.269 --> 08:08.488
Mind your own budget!

08:09.750 --> 08:11.360
I'm also putting
in my Apple Watch.

08:12.448 --> 08:15.538
And I raise you
my last chip.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.540
Okay.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.542
I call.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.414
[laughing]

08:22.458 --> 08:24.852
Full house!
King, seven.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.244
Math wins again.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.029
Or, perhaps, for the first time.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.552
Uh, not so fast.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.729
According to my calculations,
and this equation,

08:32.773 --> 08:34.601
"X" equals "you lose."

08:34.644 --> 08:36.037
What?

08:36.080 --> 08:37.386
Four queens.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.562
[gasps]
Oh...

08:39.606 --> 08:41.608
How is this possible,

08:41.651 --> 08:43.697
that I'm losing to somebody
related to Trey?

08:43.740 --> 08:46.221
But, honestly,
I'm surprised too. That's...

08:46.264 --> 08:47.527
Here you go, cuz.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.963
Thank you.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.486
Oh, look. Marty,

08:50.530 --> 08:52.053
my new Apple Watch says
it's time for you to breathe.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.708
My mama gave me that watch.

08:58.538 --> 09:02.063
All right. I know they always
called you The Bus,

09:02.106 --> 09:03.455
but back in the day,

09:03.499 --> 09:05.545
they called me The Truck.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.851
'cause I used to haul ass
into the end zone.

09:07.895 --> 09:10.071
Ha! My man!
My man.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.159
Ha-ha. My man!

09:11.202 --> 09:13.030
My m-- Dave, no.

09:17.382 --> 09:20.734
Hey, we're outta beer
and I'm outta money.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.563
And Mom wasn't lying
about knowing Jerome Bettis.

09:23.606 --> 09:24.651
What?
[chuckles]

09:24.694 --> 09:27.088
Yeah, well, Jerome
and I go way back

09:27.131 --> 09:29.220
to a time when Amazon
was just a jungle.

09:31.005 --> 09:33.050
Jerome, what was my mama
like as a kid?

09:33.094 --> 09:34.095
Lil' Tee Tee?

09:34.138 --> 09:35.618
She was a lot of fun.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.141
She was the best skater
in our crew.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.360
Except for me, of course.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.536
Man, please. You
know, it's funny

09:40.580 --> 09:42.233
how you were selling Geico,

09:42.277 --> 09:44.105
but whenever you got on wheels,

09:44.148 --> 09:45.628
your ass would crash.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.977
[laughter]

09:47.021 --> 09:48.805
You always did talk
a lot of trash.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.067
CALVIN: Yeah, sure.[Jerome chuckles]

09:50.111 --> 09:53.070
And I remember
you loved the movies,

09:53.114 --> 09:56.073
That's why we spent a lot
of time at the local drive-in.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.554
Drive-in?

09:58.598 --> 09:59.903
That requires a car.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.644
With you two alone in it.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.254
Yeah. And-and my car
was so small,

10:03.298 --> 10:06.170
she was practically
sitting on my lap.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.650
[laughs]

10:07.694 --> 10:08.999
E-Excuse me?

10:09.043 --> 10:11.872
Aw, it was like a,
like a summer romance.

10:11.915 --> 10:13.351
Like-- like Danny and Sandy.

10:13.395 --> 10:14.744
Romance?Well--

10:14.788 --> 10:16.224
Grease!
We saw that together.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.966
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, and
Saturday Night Fever.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.968
It was a-a Travolta
double feature.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.230
Double feature?

10:22.273 --> 10:24.188
That's a awful lot
of lap sitting.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.017
Wait a minute.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.497
Y... You guys weren't
a couple, were you?

10:28.540 --> 10:29.933
No, no, no, no, no.
It was nothing like that.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.414
Uh, no, it was
just a teenage fling.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.677
Fling?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.113
My woman...

10:37.506 --> 10:39.029
...and my man?

10:40.596 --> 10:41.597
[chuckling]:
Oh.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.642
Oh, man.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.651
This was fun.Good seeing you, Romy.

10:51.694 --> 10:52.695
Next time
I'm in town,

10:52.739 --> 10:54.262
I'm taking you guys to dinner.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.090
See you, Tee Tee.All right, now.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.265
Okay.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.920
I'm sure you've got
to get going, man.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.444
Got one of those
Hall of Fame meetings to get to.

11:02.487 --> 11:05.012
And get that yellow jacket out
of the dry cleaners, okay?

11:05.055 --> 11:06.404
So drive safe, my man.

11:06.448 --> 11:07.623
All right?

11:12.846 --> 11:15.022
Well, that was embarrassing.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.240
Well, yes, it was.

11:16.284 --> 11:17.981
You embarrassed
the hell out of me, Tina.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.070
I embarrassed you?

11:20.114 --> 11:22.682
You were the one
acting crazy tonight.

11:22.725 --> 11:23.944
Well, you would have, too,

11:23.987 --> 11:25.423
if you would've learned
what I just learned.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.077
I mean, who else did you date

11:27.121 --> 11:28.644
that you forgot
to mention?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.906
Barack Obama?

11:29.950 --> 11:31.255
Nelson Mandela?

11:31.299 --> 11:32.866
Ja Rule?

11:32.909 --> 11:34.911
I didn't forget
to mention anything.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.565
I was just following your

11:36.608 --> 11:40.003
"Don't Ask, Leave the Past
in the Past" rule.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.875
Well, if your past is
all up in your house

11:41.918 --> 11:43.920
eating your food,
then it's in the present.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.705
You think it's easy

11:45.748 --> 11:48.055
for me to hear about you
dating a famous athlete?

11:48.098 --> 11:52.102
You were the one who came up
with the "Don't Ask" rule.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.974
Look, and don't think
I didn't know

11:54.017 --> 11:56.628
you used to be
Mr. Player Player.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.981
But did I make
a big deal out of it?

12:01.024 --> 12:02.678
No, I did not.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.115
Well, I didn't make a big deal
out of your past, either, Tina,

12:05.159 --> 12:07.596
mainly because
I didn't think you had one.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.731
Look at all this,
Calvin.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.648
Of course I had a past!

12:16.692 --> 12:18.781
What, you want me
to start naming names?

12:18.825 --> 12:20.130
Okay, let me just...Uh-uh.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.479
No, no, no.
See, now you're going too far.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.133
No, you're the one tripping

12:23.177 --> 12:25.483
over somebody that I went to
a movie with over 30 years ago,

12:25.527 --> 12:27.529
who you invited to dinner

12:27.572 --> 12:29.487
and then acted like a child.

12:29.531 --> 12:30.619
A child?
Yes.

12:30.662 --> 12:31.707
You know, nah, nah.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.056
Don't try to put this
on me, Tina.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.188
You know what, Calvin?

12:34.231 --> 12:35.406
I don't have time for this.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.191
Well, I didn't have time
for it first.

12:37.234 --> 12:38.453
Well, good!
Good!

12:38.496 --> 12:39.889
Good!Good!

12:41.282 --> 12:42.674
And we cancelling Geico!

12:51.118 --> 12:54.208
I brought you the traditional
husband peace offering.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.819
Traditionally, that's jewelry.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.257
But I'll take the pie anyway.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.785
Look... [sighs]

13:05.828 --> 13:08.396
I know it was stupid
to lie about my number.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.137
We had just
started dating,

13:10.180 --> 13:11.791
and you were
a little weirded out

13:11.834 --> 13:13.488
about my
"open book" policy.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.359
You know, whenever we
would open my book,

13:15.403 --> 13:17.144
you wanted to
burn all the pages.

13:18.188 --> 13:22.192
No, I just really liked
the chapters about us.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.194
Exactly. And I didn't
want to hurt you

13:24.238 --> 13:27.023
with my typical
Dave "oversharing."

13:27.067 --> 13:29.199
Especially when it was
about all the women

13:29.243 --> 13:33.160
who turned me into, well,
the sexual animal I am today.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.166
An example of oversharing.

13:41.908 --> 13:45.172
I admit, I used to get
uncomfortable about your past.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.783
But I'm much more secure now

13:47.827 --> 13:49.829
because of our
open-book policy.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.918
I'm just mad that you lied.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.529
I get that.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.313
And... and I'm sorry.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.880
Thank you.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.230
And while we're here,
you know, I did--

14:00.274 --> 14:03.103
to be totally
transparent-- remember

14:03.146 --> 14:04.931
a seventh girl.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.889
She's the one who
taught me to...

14:06.933 --> 14:08.586
Stop talking.

14:11.938 --> 14:15.767
Well, I should also be
totally transparent.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.509
I might've spent
some time in the Ozarks

14:18.553 --> 14:21.208
with Justin Timberlake.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.733
Let's just say
we were, uh,

14:24.776 --> 14:26.517
NSYNC.

14:31.392 --> 14:34.090
Okay. [laughs]

14:34.134 --> 14:35.135
That's funny!

14:38.703 --> 14:40.314
Wait, for real? Justin?

14:42.229 --> 14:44.187
Gemma, I gotta know.
He's all over my playlist.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.110
Ah...Uh...

14:54.154 --> 14:55.590
Hey, Dad.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.070
Did I catch you
at a bad time?

14:57.113 --> 14:59.072
No, son. Never better.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.551
Good.

15:00.595 --> 15:01.770
Uh...

15:01.813 --> 15:03.163
I was a little embarrassed

15:03.206 --> 15:04.251
to bring this up in front of
Jerome Bettis, but...

15:04.294 --> 15:06.122
Don't say that name
in that house.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.820
Don't say that name
on this porch.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.648
Right.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.825
Well, see, I-I created
this poker system

15:13.869 --> 15:15.305
based on math, that, uh...

15:15.349 --> 15:17.307
All right.
How much did you lose?

15:17.351 --> 15:19.962
Let's just say I'd have to cash
out some Bitcoin to make rent.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.269
Oh, no, not your Bitcoin.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.575
I don't care. Pay me.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.710
Okay, all right.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.407
Quit playing.
I got your back, man.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.800
Oh. Thanks, Dad.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.323
But you're gonna have
to clean up this yard,

15:33.367 --> 15:35.891
wax the cars
and scrape off the grill.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.327
Okay, all right.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.981
Fair enough. I respect that.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.288
You know,
I'm glad you're my dad, man.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.594
Even though I probably could
have been a famous athlete

15:43.638 --> 15:44.944
if Jerome Bettis
had been my father.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.860
Me, too, son.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.993
Even though
I could have been retired

15:51.037 --> 15:53.082
if Patrick Mahomes was my son.

15:56.912 --> 15:59.567
Hey, Calvin, I'm
returning your pie tin.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.047
How are you
and Tina doing?

16:01.090 --> 16:02.396
I don't know.

16:02.439 --> 16:05.225
Ask Romy Rome.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.009
So, you're still mad at her?

16:07.053 --> 16:09.490
Look, you just don't get over
something like that.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.274
The man is in
the Hall of Fame.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.450
Plus, I've napped
in his jersey.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.629
Okay, so you're
really mad.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.242
But you know what, you're right.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.722
In fact,
I'm still mad at Dave.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.681
Gemma, come on.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.205
Is the number
really that important?

16:29.249 --> 16:31.991
Yes! I'm not sure
I can ever forgive him.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.645
Okay. You know what?

16:34.689 --> 16:36.996
This sounds
a little extreme, so...

16:37.039 --> 16:38.693
tell me what's really going on.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.087
I can't stop thinking
about those other women.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.045
Well, that's why I created

16:43.089 --> 16:45.395
"Don't Ask,
Leave Your Past in the Past."

16:45.439 --> 16:49.138
Also known as "Don't Ask
or That's Yo Ass."

16:49.182 --> 16:50.748
[sighs]

16:50.792 --> 16:53.186
I mean, I was
his eighth choice.

16:53.229 --> 16:55.666
I bet he'd love to leave
me for number seven.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.060
She's probably
some doctor type

16:58.104 --> 17:01.803
who's really good
at full-body exams...

17:01.846 --> 17:04.023
if you know
what I mean.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.981
I do.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.158
But that's not Dave.

17:09.202 --> 17:13.380
Dave is the guy that crocheted
us all mittens for Christmas.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.080
Look, Dave married you.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.864
He loves you.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.475
Those other women don't matter.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.651
You have nothing
to be insecure about.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.914
Do you really believe that?

17:25.957 --> 17:27.220
You're damn right I do.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.310
Then act like it.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.139
[whoops]

17:33.182 --> 17:35.184
Ooh, mic drop.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.186
[crunches][gasps]

17:37.230 --> 17:40.363
Oh, my God, I
cracked my screen.

17:42.409 --> 17:43.497
Hey, babe.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.542
I don't want to talk.

17:45.586 --> 17:49.111
Look, I was thinking that
I might owe you an apology.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.941
Keep talking.

17:52.984 --> 17:56.118
[sighs]
I'm sorry that I got jealous.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.946
[sighs]

17:57.989 --> 17:59.426
What were you thinking?

17:59.469 --> 18:01.036
I don't know.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.211
I guess I wasn't.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.647
I just...

18:03.691 --> 18:05.606
I got a little insecure that...

18:05.649 --> 18:07.477
I thought maybe you thought

18:07.521 --> 18:09.218
you made the wrong choice.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.002
Wrong choice?

18:11.046 --> 18:12.526
I chose The Truck.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.180
The Truck is built
for anything.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.399
Yeah, but he's The Bus.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.793
You could have been Mrs. Bus.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.143
You know?

18:21.187 --> 18:22.840
Living the good life.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.364
Front-row seats to the game,

18:24.407 --> 18:26.844
private jets,
flashy jewelry.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.458
Calvin, what are you
talking about?

18:31.501 --> 18:33.416
I am living my best life.

18:33.460 --> 18:36.158
Yeah, but being married to
a guy that owns a body shop

18:36.202 --> 18:39.161
doesn't get you on The Real
Housewives of Pittsburgh.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.382
Calvin, I have had
lots of chances

18:42.425 --> 18:43.861
at living that life,

18:43.905 --> 18:46.125
but I chose you
and the life you offered.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.346
What do you mean you had
"lots of chances"?

18:52.479 --> 18:55.046
Oh, you thought
you were playing about Ja Rule.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.352
What? Tina...

18:56.396 --> 18:58.224
I-I'm just playing,
I'm just playing.

19:00.095 --> 19:01.792
Calvin... [sighs]

19:01.836 --> 19:05.274
You know, nothing can replace
the chemistry we have.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.754
Do you know
how I feel

19:06.797 --> 19:08.408
every time you walk
into a room?

19:10.061 --> 19:13.064
I'm guessing...
pretty good?

19:13.108 --> 19:15.023
After 32 years of marriage,

19:15.066 --> 19:17.765
I still light up.
Every time.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.724
I feel bad.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.813
I guess I should've told you
about Jerome.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.685
Nah.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.469
No, the rule is the rule.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.428
And I still think
it's the right way to go.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.386
I mean, who cares
about our past

19:30.430 --> 19:32.258
when we're
each other's forever?

19:32.301 --> 19:33.650
Mmm.

19:33.694 --> 19:34.912
I love you.

19:34.956 --> 19:36.131
[chuckles]

19:36.175 --> 19:37.350
I think it was
kind of sexy, though,

19:37.393 --> 19:39.265
with you being so jealous.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.788
Made me feel like
I still got it.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.920
Oh, trust me,

19:42.964 --> 19:44.313
you still got it.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.228
[both laugh]

19:46.272 --> 19:48.143
And I still want it.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.147
Now come on,
let's go get unholy.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.714
Come on.
Okay.

19:58.980 --> 20:01.200
[Tina laughs]

20:01.243 --> 20:03.202
Thanks for taking me
to the movies, Calvin.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.378
Anytime, Lil' Tee Tee.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.075
[both chuckle]

20:08.294 --> 20:10.470
Ooh! This is
my favorite part.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.472
He is so cute!

20:12.515 --> 20:14.517
♪

20:18.739 --> 20:20.349
No!
