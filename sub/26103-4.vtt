00:00.020 --> 00:02.701
I knew I wasn't the only one.
He's still doing it now.

00:02.726 --> 00:04.868
I found the piece, wrote it, oversaw it.

00:04.893 --> 00:06.088
I'm granting the temporary injunction.

00:06.113 --> 00:07.653
- Pulp the papers.
- What?

00:08.193 --> 00:11.215
How did you get the story
at exactly the same time?

00:11.240 --> 00:12.486
Something in the water.

00:12.511 --> 00:13.959
My new flatmate, he works for The Post.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.919
- I think he stole it.
- You still want the PM?

00:15.920 --> 00:19.119
I want the word paedophile
inches from his face.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.959
That should get them flying
off the shelves.

00:20.960 --> 00:24.119
My one real job is to ensure the
continued daily publication of the

00:24.120 --> 00:27.680
newspaper and for the first time in
living memory that hasn't happened.

01:04.599 --> 01:05.600
So what now?

01:07.920 --> 01:11.034
That's up to Amina. But we don't
want two days without a paper,

01:11.035 --> 01:12.448
so let's just get on with it.

01:12.449 --> 01:13.679
What are you doing today?

01:13.680 --> 01:15.920
Er, Leona has a thing she
wants me to help with.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.263
- What thing?
- I don't know.

01:17.288 --> 01:18.399
You two cooking something up?

01:18.400 --> 01:20.599
I have no idea,
she said she can't do it on her own.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.239
That hardly narrows it down, does it?

01:22.240 --> 01:24.579
I can tell her it has to wait,
I can stay here, I can help.

01:24.580 --> 01:27.719
No, no, no, she's showing
initiative. You should do it.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.736
- But West.
- We're not finished with West.

01:29.761 --> 01:30.827
And The Post?

01:30.828 --> 01:32.350
We haven't finished with The Post either.

01:32.351 --> 01:33.880
Cos we can't just leave what they've done.

01:33.905 --> 01:35.744
We won't. Go on, help Leona.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.440
OK.

02:34.374 --> 02:42.414

02:45.833 --> 02:49.153
- You know that scene in Spotlight?
- What's Spotlight?

02:49.480 --> 02:51.548
- It's a film.
- Never heard of it.

02:51.573 --> 02:54.060
Really? It won an Oscar.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.519
Anyway, there's a bit where
a story goes in the paper and

02:58.520 --> 03:00.799
suddenly all the phones are ringing.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.408
People calling with their
experiences of the same thing.

03:03.409 --> 03:05.279
- OK?
- That's what's happening here.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.479
We've got 11 women saying he did
a similar thing to them.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.740
By the way, Emmerson's in your office.

03:12.610 --> 03:13.679
What does he want?

03:13.680 --> 03:15.279
Isn't he good mates with Joshua West?

03:15.280 --> 03:16.845
Have you got the details
of those other women?

03:16.870 --> 03:17.892
Yeah.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.160
You really haven't seen Spotlight?

03:27.160 --> 03:29.940
Ah, good one. Good one.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.440
Here.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.040
All got in contact this morning.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.280
18...

03:52.360 --> 03:54.279
18...

03:54.280 --> 03:55.959
19...

03:55.960 --> 03:57.079
18.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.679
Six more.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.959
I like West too but it turns out
he was a pervert.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.114
I heard you split up with Sarah.

04:04.115 --> 04:05.320
I...

04:06.680 --> 04:10.199
Yes. And, strangely, we're all happier.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.239
Literally everyone in the world
is smiling because of my

04:13.240 --> 04:14.599
impending divorce.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.599
And, more to the point, this is me
doing my job so with all the

04:17.600 --> 04:21.040
respect in the world, back off.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.280
Actually, I came here to congratulate you.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.999
Right, good.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.679
With money and power mean
you can get what you want.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.826
Which is fine if, like me, all
you're after is the occasional boat.

04:31.827 --> 04:35.340
But if you're into this
sort of thing, well...

04:36.120 --> 04:38.559
My daughter always said he was creepy.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.480
I never liked his hands.

04:41.660 --> 04:44.640
PM's not happy about where
you put his picture.

04:44.665 --> 04:45.844
Why not?

04:45.960 --> 04:48.700
Too close to the words "Sex Pest".

04:49.600 --> 04:51.820
No. Really?

04:54.640 --> 04:56.279
- Oh, yeah.
- Call him up.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.700
- Reassure him.
- Maybe if I get a quiet moment.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.100
- I liked Sarah.
- I didn't.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.719
And what about Fred, he all right?

05:09.720 --> 05:11.060
I try to phone, but...

05:12.000 --> 05:14.340
apparently it's always the wrong moment.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.560
Wish you ran your family
like you run your paper.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.480
I did. That was the problem.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.520
Well done on this, anyway.

05:24.920 --> 05:25.920
Thanks.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.380
And do call the PM.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.180
If you get a quiet moment.

05:39.760 --> 05:40.760
- Get Ed.
- Righto.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.919
Where did it come from?

06:06.920 --> 06:09.240
You told Raz you had
a feeling about West.

06:09.820 --> 06:13.820
And then when you passed that on to
Alex, it came with detailed notes.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.159
And for some reason,
you didn't want to work on it.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.880
That's not a feeling,
that's a guilty conscience.

06:21.300 --> 06:22.999
It's an important part
of being a journalist

06:23.000 --> 06:24.759
that you protect your sources.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.119
Yeah, I understand that, I do,

06:28.120 --> 06:31.540
but tell me where you got it...
or you're fired.

06:35.360 --> 06:39.759
My flatmate's a journalist.
She left it out.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.759
Does she work at the Herald?

06:41.760 --> 06:43.239
Holly Evans.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.199
We've got a problem. Len's just called.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.460
He wasn't allowed into the Prime
Minister's conference this morning.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.559
I beg your pardon?

06:52.560 --> 06:54.479
Focus on the money, not the gossip.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.679
The Post will cover that.
I want financial details,

06:56.680 --> 06:58.839
the reactions of his corporations,
the charities.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.439
And somebody find out where he is.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.520
He's one of the richest men in the
country, someone must know. Yeah.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.040
Great. Thanks.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.319
Craig, can you check in with the
West team throughout the day?

07:12.320 --> 07:14.540
- They need to stay on track.
- Mm-hm.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.719
You've got people on Joshua West?

07:16.720 --> 07:17.807
Yeah. We're going to find him.

07:17.832 --> 07:19.679
Ask all his affiliated
companies for a response.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.183
- We lost the story.
- Yeah, I know but...

07:21.208 --> 07:22.239
Do something else.

07:22.240 --> 07:28.255
We'll do a big front page apology.
Headline... "We're sorry". Up front.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.239
Honest. Draw a line.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.101
- Really?
- Can you write it?

07:32.102 --> 07:34.479
And I'm aware it's not
your job technically,

07:34.480 --> 07:36.040
but you know what you're doing.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.879
What, is this what they want?
A full front page apology?

07:40.880 --> 07:42.519
Cos it's a bad idea
to be on the back foot.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.799
No, it's not what they want.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.720
- Amina, we've only been...
- It's what I want.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.940
- You ready?
- Er, yeah.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.640
- Do I need anything?
- Just the usual.

08:02.665 --> 08:04.799
- Where we going?
- The Hill.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.758
- Which Hill?
- You haven't heard of the Hill?

08:06.783 --> 08:07.853
Are you OK?

08:07.854 --> 08:09.080
You're in for a treat.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.239
Can you knock, please?

08:23.240 --> 08:25.999
- You've got an open door policy.
- Well, we should look at that.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.679
- How are you?
- You'll do conference today.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.279
We need new stories, business as usual.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.840
You didn't answer my question.

08:32.527 --> 08:34.759
- What?
- How are you?

08:34.760 --> 08:36.711
Jesus, Peter, we sleep together once,

08:36.712 --> 08:38.107
you think I need a shoulder to cry on...

08:38.133 --> 08:39.357
I ask you how you are all the time.

08:39.381 --> 08:41.839
I've told them that I caused
the mess, I'll clear it up.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.879
You didn't do anything wrong.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.159
Cos for the first time that
anyone can remember

08:46.160 --> 08:48.159
a national newspaper's failed to print.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.919
It's my paper, so that's...

08:49.920 --> 08:51.999
Holly's right, you know.
Why aren't we fighting?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.630
Explaining to them what happened and...

08:53.655 --> 08:54.799
People don't care why we

08:54.800 --> 08:57.959
got it wrong, they feel let down
and they'll want,

08:57.960 --> 08:59.999
much like the Board,
to know who's to blame.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.319
I'm the editor in chief here,

09:01.320 --> 09:03.240
so there really is only
one name on that list.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.460
What was last night?

09:13.640 --> 09:16.199
- We were drunk.
- It was a mistake.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.940
I want you to understand that. A mistake.

09:20.480 --> 09:24.559
I'm going to offer my resignation.
By the end of the day.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.119
If you resign, I'll resign too.

09:26.120 --> 09:30.580
Don't be ridiculous. You have a job
to do. You need to be out there. Go.

09:45.980 --> 09:50.440
Oh, the service has definitely
improved since I was last here.

09:50.600 --> 09:55.100
- The Prime Minister won't be a moment.
- Good to know. Thanks.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.180
- I want an apology.
- That's funny, cos so do I.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.159
- You didn't let my reporter in.
- That's right.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.080
Post is banned until further notice.

10:17.105 --> 10:19.700
- What for?
- Being inaccurate.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.239
Did I hurt your feelings?

10:22.240 --> 10:24.159
You put a picture of me with my family

10:24.160 --> 10:26.159
by a headline that said "Sex Pest".

10:26.160 --> 10:27.359
That was about Josh West.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.079
Nothing inaccurate about that story,
by the way. But, yeah,

10:30.080 --> 10:32.319
I'm sorry, that's just how it fell.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.519
On the page. Either way though,
you don't blacklist us.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.799
That's not how it's done.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.359
I know former Prime Ministers have
bent over backwards to

10:38.360 --> 10:41.439
indulge you, but I looked at that
picture of my family that I

10:41.440 --> 10:44.820
never wanted, and I thought...
it stops now.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.079
You don't have the power you did.
TV, Twitter, YouTube.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.119
They don't need you like we used to.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.799
- Do you want a war?
- I want respect.

10:53.800 --> 10:54.959
You carry on with this,

10:54.960 --> 10:58.679
we'll be putting the censure
of the press up on the website

10:58.680 --> 11:01.919
immediately, then tweeting it,
then on the front page tomorrow.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.080
That's up to you.

11:04.220 --> 11:08.780
Oh, and this Resonance thing that
you seem so keen to kept quiet.

11:08.805 --> 11:10.125
Maybe I'll look into that.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.560
If you want to be allowed back
into the briefing...

11:16.520 --> 11:18.159
I'm going to need that apology.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.799
Don't hold your breath.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.060
Maybe instead what you should...

11:32.280 --> 11:34.919
- Ready to leave?
- Yup.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.180
Yeah, sure, why not?

11:39.400 --> 11:41.294
I'm going to have another go
at persuading you.

11:41.295 --> 11:42.255
Not now.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.879
I'm presuming that most
of Josh West's victims

11:43.880 --> 11:46.332
have got in touch with the Post.
Well, three of them have come to us

11:46.333 --> 11:47.822
with details that are remarkably similar.

11:47.847 --> 11:49.264
- Also...
- No.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.439
Then what do I say to these women?

11:52.440 --> 11:54.799
Say that we're not looking
to cover the story.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.920
- And tell them to go to the Post.
- If they like.

12:07.280 --> 12:09.599
'Understandably, there is a lot of
interest in all this,

12:09.600 --> 12:12.399
'and there's a lot of questions
people want answers too.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.919
'I could use this opportunity to
apologise to any of you,

12:15.920 --> 12:18.852
'my customers, who feel let down.

12:18.853 --> 12:20.679
'And I am sorry.

12:20.680 --> 12:25.740
'But really I want to apologise
publicly to my wife, Caroline.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.680
'And my children.

12:29.120 --> 12:33.940
'You probably deserve a much better
man as a husband... as a father.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.319
'In all honesty I really don't know
what they're feeling right now.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.260
'But I am keen to make it work.

12:42.780 --> 12:44.679
- 'Thank you.
- 'Mr West, are you going to resign?

12:44.680 --> 12:46.159
'No, I'm not going to resign.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.999
'I'm going to carry on
and try to fix this mess.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.480
- 'Yes?
- 'Venture West?

12:51.505 --> 12:52.679
'Venture West, er,

12:52.680 --> 12:54.680
'we've got some exciting new
developments...'

13:00.887 --> 13:03.099
_

13:06.252 --> 13:08.252
_

13:18.680 --> 13:19.707
Some water?

13:20.413 --> 13:22.180
Er, yeah, thanks.

13:22.560 --> 13:26.879
- Still or sparkling?
- Just... tap water's fine.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.119
Tap water?

13:28.120 --> 13:29.920
Sparkling's great, thanks so much.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.519
So you come here a lot?

13:37.520 --> 13:40.839
- Once or twice.
- Why won't you tell me what this is?

13:40.840 --> 13:43.319
You wouldn't have come
if you knew who we were meeting.

13:43.320 --> 13:47.100
- Who are we meeting?
- Leona! So pleased you could make it.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.676
- Absolute pleasure! How are you?
- Mwah.

13:50.677 --> 13:51.719
Terrible.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.919
The taxi couldn't make to the
door because of road works

13:53.920 --> 13:55.799
so it parked round the corner
and I had to walk.

13:55.800 --> 13:59.039
Two Big Issue sellers and 12
smokers later, here I am.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.080
- Is this him?
- Yes. James Edwards.

14:02.105 --> 14:06.144
- James?
- Oh, sorry. Pleasure.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.679
No, no, no. You despise me.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.079
I can tell, I've seen that look
before. You didn't tell him

14:10.080 --> 14:10.897
who he was meeting.

14:10.898 --> 14:14.599
- He... I'm not sure he would have come.
- Well, that makes sense.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.799
I imagine you lot are feeling rather
prickly this morning. No paper!

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
How embarrassing!

14:25.600 --> 14:26.999
I'm friends with Leona's mother.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.639
We're on the board of the local theatre.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.959
She's a hoot. I needed a favour,
so I got in contact with Dumpling.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.479
- Who's Dumpling?
- Dumpling.There. Dumpling.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.999
That is what your mother
calls you, isn't it?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.679
- Normally not in front of people.
- Oh, well. Your secret's out.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.612
Sorry, this is the story that
you want me to help you with?

14:41.637 --> 14:42.799
- Yes.
- Yeah.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.279
I'm the story.

14:44.280 --> 14:47.079
What, do you want to criticise
poor people for their education?

14:47.080 --> 14:49.719
Do you want to beat up on some
parents who've lost their child

14:49.720 --> 14:50.999
for crying on television?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.679
No, I want to talk to you because
I've done something terrible.

14:53.680 --> 14:57.039
Possibly criminal. It needs to be
public and I hoped you'd write it.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.040
Shall we order?

15:15.160 --> 15:16.879
You were working on Geoff Newman,

15:16.880 --> 15:18.511
that ex-soldier you thought
had murdered that boy.

15:18.536 --> 15:19.643
Yeah.

15:19.644 --> 15:21.260
You realise he didn't do it?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.399
After three days of persecution
by your paper, the police

15:24.400 --> 15:26.679
announced this morning that
they found the real killer.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.660
- The child's step-father.
- I know.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.740
So were you just
pretending with that or...

15:31.765 --> 15:32.799
No, I was busy

15:32.800 --> 15:34.999
so a separate team
took the Josh West story.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.680
After you gave them my notes.

15:36.705 --> 15:38.959
Your notes were there, under the table.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.679
Don't do that.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.940
- This was a choice.
- I'm a journalist.

15:43.886 --> 15:46.460
- You would have done the same.
- You know I wouldn't.

15:46.920 --> 15:51.180
I mean... in a way, with what
happened, it's lucky.

15:52.379 --> 15:54.659
If I hadn't taken them,
people wouldn't know.

15:54.684 --> 15:56.604
- So I should be thanking you?
- No! Just...

15:58.240 --> 16:01.319
That's what Duncan said today,
that you were our best reporter.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.140
You got the story and you were
better than all of us.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.891
- Who did he say that to?
- Everyone. In conference.

16:07.892 --> 16:10.959
He said give a round of applause
for our star reporter Holly Evans.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.080
And everyone laughed.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.360
He thinks it's funny.

16:15.385 --> 16:17.384
He said if only he could
thank you in person.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.320
Right.

16:24.886 --> 16:30.100
I'm sorry. Are we OK? I can
still stay in the flat?

16:31.540 --> 16:32.540
Course.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.720
Come on.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.160
Perfect.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.639
Why did you have risotto? So boring.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.599
It was pretty much the only thing on
the menu I knew how to pronounce.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.079
So ask! They don't mind!

18:10.080 --> 18:11.999
I mean, yes,
you will look unsophisticated,

18:12.000 --> 18:13.959
but in your case that ship's
pretty much sailed.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.759
Clothes. Accent. I mean,
do you think people look northern?

18:16.760 --> 18:18.520
I think they do. I think you can tell.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.999
So. What have you done?

18:23.000 --> 18:25.399
Is this really how you warm up
the subjects of your interviews?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.434
I'm not in the mood to warm up,
if you want to tell us something,

18:27.435 --> 18:29.919
- please just...
- It's not quite that, actually.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.439
I'm not here to tell you anything,
I'm here to check you out.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.120
To see if you should have my confession.

18:34.145 --> 18:35.279
God.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.799
- Are you sure this is worth it?
- Yes.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.359
Because I'm overdue a trip
to the dentist and right now,

18:39.360 --> 18:41.719
that feels like a less painful
way to spend my time.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.759
Irony, good! I like a sense of humour.

18:43.760 --> 18:44.840
Can you not just do this yourself?

18:44.865 --> 18:45.959
- No.
- Why not?

18:45.960 --> 18:47.026
You've been at the paper a while,

18:47.027 --> 18:50.039
- you just need to...
- She asked for you specifically.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.140
- She what?
- Oh, yes. I wanted James Edwards.

18:56.553 --> 18:57.633
Why?

18:57.658 --> 18:59.698
I wanted someone incorruptible.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.083
Who drives to the heart of the story
and says it like it is.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.148
Who people respect.
Who won't pull punches.

19:04.173 --> 19:05.533
I have to say, so far, so good.

19:09.313 --> 19:11.793
- What have you done?
- Later.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.919
Seeing as the Herald's paying for this,

19:13.920 --> 19:16.760
after he's finished the boring
risotto, shall we move on?

20:05.453 --> 20:09.140
Come in. Sit down, if... If you want.

20:10.786 --> 20:16.300
I got you a flat white, which I
think you like. Some biscuits.

20:17.779 --> 20:18.923
I hear you're angry.

20:18.948 --> 20:20.820
- You knew I was coming.
- Yeah.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.200
I told Ed to persuade you.

20:25.537 --> 20:26.736
You stole my work.

20:26.737 --> 20:29.856
Your flatmate stole your work.
I published it.

20:29.857 --> 20:33.256
West was always going to launch
a full-blown legal battle.

20:33.257 --> 20:34.420
Amina was naive.

20:35.497 --> 20:37.340
Do you want to see
what we've got for tomorrow?

20:39.337 --> 20:40.417
Look.

20:42.583 --> 20:44.943
He's moved into his club,
the Royal Albion.

20:44.968 --> 20:49.368
So we indulge in some healthy
speculation about the state

20:49.393 --> 20:50.393
of his marriage.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.097
Did you see that conference he did?

20:55.617 --> 20:57.020
Real penitence.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.677
Well, I don't know if it was real,
but it was convincing.

21:04.217 --> 21:05.460
It's getting cold.

21:09.150 --> 21:11.710
Why are you sending all my presents back?

21:11.735 --> 21:14.615
You liked the umbrella.
You sent me an e-mail.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.320
Yeah, that was a mistake.

21:16.377 --> 21:19.696
Right. Cos I read it like
an expression of interest.

21:19.697 --> 21:22.696
Apparently you told everyone that
I was one of your best reporters.

21:22.697 --> 21:25.216
Well, you were responsible for our
best story of in weeks,

21:25.217 --> 21:27.976
and you are standing in my office
with a staff card so...

21:27.977 --> 21:29.376
I want an apology.

21:29.377 --> 21:30.536
I am very sorry.

21:30.561 --> 21:33.680
- Printed.
- Oh, no.

21:34.229 --> 21:35.549
What upsets you the most?

21:35.574 --> 21:39.020
The plagiarism? Or that
the Herald missed an edition?

21:39.661 --> 21:43.740
Look, everything happened like I'm
sure you hoped it would, by the way.

21:43.741 --> 21:47.500
We've had 11 calls today from
other women who were on the

21:47.501 --> 21:51.780
programme when they slept with West,
and felt they'd been used.

21:51.781 --> 21:53.880
- Yeah, we've had calls too.
- Right then.

21:53.905 --> 21:55.900
But he's getting away with it.

21:55.901 --> 21:58.759
That conference. The carefully
managed apologists on TV.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.660
He's got advisors managing this
to limit the

22:00.661 --> 22:03.254
damage so no-one's talking about
him, they're talking about us.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.328
The Herald.

22:04.329 --> 22:07.203
That's because you weren't out
there today, explaining why.

22:07.228 --> 22:08.340
I know.

22:08.341 --> 22:10.140
What's your front page tomorrow?

22:10.581 --> 22:13.820
It's looking like an apology to the
people for missing a print edition.

22:14.261 --> 22:16.120
- Bad choice.
- I know.

22:16.145 --> 22:17.380
I know you know.

22:17.381 --> 22:20.100
If we'd published the West story,
we'd put the pressure on, be

22:20.101 --> 22:23.140
following it up for a week, longer
articles, profiles on the victims,

22:23.141 --> 22:26.524
but I'm guessing, since you've
covered it, tomorrow you'll move on.

22:26.525 --> 22:28.420
Yeah, well, like I said,
we've got him going into his club,

22:28.421 --> 22:30.300
and that's on page five and six,
so you're right,

22:30.301 --> 22:32.100
yeah, there's probably
not much more to say.

22:32.101 --> 22:35.060
He deserves to lose everything
for what he's done to those women.

22:35.061 --> 22:36.900
Whatever he deserves,

22:36.901 --> 22:40.780
he's not actually done anything
illegal, so that's pretty hard.

22:43.341 --> 22:45.860
- Yeah.
- Sit down, please. Sit down.

22:51.981 --> 22:54.060
Why are you an editor?

22:54.061 --> 22:55.780
You should be a special correspondent.

22:55.781 --> 22:58.820
You should be out there with the
resources to find the stories,

22:58.821 --> 23:01.633
and the talent to write them,
without interference.

23:01.634 --> 23:04.547
I read your stuff. You're really good.

23:04.548 --> 23:06.940
You can't be happy, where you are.

23:06.941 --> 23:09.329
Doing admin on a slowly sinking ship.

23:09.330 --> 23:11.120
What we do is becoming more important,

23:11.145 --> 23:12.601
between the crap conspiracy theories

23:12.602 --> 23:14.696
- on the internet, false accounts...
- That's interesting...

23:14.697 --> 23:17.233
And all the shite that
your paper's shovelling out.

23:17.234 --> 23:18.473
You don't sound very convincing.

23:18.474 --> 23:19.780
Yeah, look, you're starting to lapse.

23:19.781 --> 23:21.420
- No.
- Yeah,

23:21.445 --> 23:23.066
you're beginning to see
the world like I do.

23:23.091 --> 23:24.260
Apologise!

23:25.061 --> 23:26.741
Let me whisper in your ear.

23:31.741 --> 23:33.980
There isn't a solution to the world.

23:33.981 --> 23:37.140
And, more than that,
there's not always progress.

23:37.141 --> 23:40.340
Right, that's why we're
making money and you're not.

23:40.341 --> 23:43.980
That's why we're hiring the best
people, and you're not.

23:45.221 --> 23:48.700
That's why we've got a big future,
in a gleaming building,

23:48.701 --> 23:51.940
and you, over there, have got
mouse traps in every corridor.

23:51.941 --> 23:54.693
It's why I tell the Prime Minister
what to do,

23:54.694 --> 23:57.060
and Amina can barely get a paper out.

23:57.061 --> 24:01.620
Because while you try to hold up
a mirror to expose small

24:01.621 --> 24:04.177
hypocrisies around the edges of
a world that doesn't really exist,

24:04.178 --> 24:07.659
we influence the outcome of elections.

24:07.660 --> 24:15.061
We protect the NHS, the poor,
the voiceless, but we do it through

24:15.086 --> 24:18.646
the most outrageous storytelling
in the world, not statistics.

24:18.671 --> 24:20.060
And people love us.

24:27.321 --> 24:30.668
Come and write for us. I'm serious.

24:30.693 --> 24:33.220
If you could write anything
for tomorrow, anything.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.221
What would it be?

24:35.434 --> 24:37.794
- I'd follow up on Josh West.
- Why?

24:37.819 --> 24:40.700
- Because there's more.
- More what? Why?

24:42.707 --> 24:44.907
- Instinct.
- Good answer.

24:44.932 --> 24:48.452
- You should find out.
- The world's shit at the moment.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.518
But at least at the Herald
we try to make it a bit better.

24:51.519 --> 24:53.021
And how's that going?

24:55.861 --> 24:57.820
No-one will stop you being you.

24:57.821 --> 25:01.706
No-one would stop you being intelligent.

25:01.707 --> 25:05.574
You don't have to keep trying
to make the world better, Holly,

25:05.575 --> 25:08.620
just live in it, report it.

25:10.360 --> 25:15.369
Break free.
Who knows what might happen to you?

25:15.370 --> 25:18.220
So much more than what's going
on in your life now.

25:19.141 --> 25:20.956
You could dress properly,
if you wanted to,

25:20.957 --> 25:24.220
you could have the life
you've actually always wanted.

25:28.130 --> 25:29.621
No more mousetraps.

25:30.583 --> 25:33.060
- You don't know anything about me.
- I do, now.

25:33.061 --> 25:34.300
A bit, I do.

25:36.054 --> 25:37.254
Wait!

25:42.947 --> 25:46.780
Another present. And maybe keep this one.

25:48.527 --> 25:49.727
Follow your instincts.

25:53.854 --> 25:55.774
And think about my offer.

25:58.394 --> 26:04.460
Everyone knows it's chaos over
there. Come here instead.

26:11.101 --> 26:12.221
Do you want to see this?

26:16.593 --> 26:18.220
Yeah, it's fine.

26:20.427 --> 26:21.427
Where's Holly?

26:22.661 --> 26:25.120
- Craig, where's Holly?
- I don't know.

26:25.145 --> 26:28.060
- Brilliant.
- Just wait five minutes.

26:32.940 --> 26:35.699
- We need to get off-stone.
- I told you it's fine.

26:35.700 --> 26:39.249
It's wrong. Your entire response to
what's happened is wrong.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.380
You're being weak.

26:40.381 --> 26:44.731
Do you know what you're projecting
to everyone out there? Shame.

26:44.732 --> 26:47.295
That as a paper we've made some
massive mistake...

26:47.320 --> 26:48.679
We have. There isn't a paper.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.249
When you walked in here today,

26:50.250 --> 26:53.183
we all thought, "This is going
to be her big moment."

26:53.183 --> 26:54.869
You know, we all thought there
was going to be a big speech.

26:54.870 --> 26:57.702
But no, you just turned
and walked into an office.

26:57.703 --> 27:01.924
- No leadership, no defiance. Shame.
- It is shame.

27:01.925 --> 27:03.982
Congratulations,
you've correctly identified it.

27:03.983 --> 27:07.302
- Right, so you need...
- I have told them that I'm resigning.

27:07.303 --> 27:09.702
They're going to take the night
to think about next steps.

27:09.703 --> 27:12.342
Come back in the morning,
get the paper off-stone, Peter.

27:12.343 --> 27:14.382
You're not my mum, you're not my husband,

27:14.383 --> 27:17.142
you're just someone I had sex
with once last night who therefore

27:17.143 --> 27:18.205
thinks he knows me...

27:18.230 --> 27:19.822
I know you better than your ex-husband,

27:19.823 --> 27:21.109
I know you better than your friends.

27:21.110 --> 27:24.086
I work closely with you every day.
This is tough love.

27:24.087 --> 27:26.020
- Sort yourself out...
- Call your wife.

27:27.750 --> 27:29.280
What?

27:29.305 --> 27:32.263
Call your wife and tell her
you're not coming home tonight.

27:33.420 --> 27:35.700
- I don't know...
- I don't want you to go home tonight.

27:57.034 --> 27:59.520
- Where did you go?
- Some air.

27:59.545 --> 28:01.662
- We're nearly done.
- Craig's on it.

28:01.663 --> 28:03.582
You've never got "some air", why now?

28:03.583 --> 28:05.382
Because I'm the deputy news editor

28:05.383 --> 28:08.700
and I don't think that an apology
counts as news. What about you?

28:16.729 --> 28:17.729
All right.

28:19.216 --> 28:21.176
Amina's sure.

28:22.423 --> 28:23.860
We're off-stone.

28:37.532 --> 28:39.360
- Do you believe in God?
- No.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.411
And you're parents, they're still alive?

28:41.412 --> 28:42.680
- Yep.
- And where do they live?

28:42.705 --> 28:44.691
- Bolton.
- Urgh! Awful place.

28:44.692 --> 28:46.853
What sort of house? Terraced, Billy
Elliot sort of thing?

28:46.854 --> 28:48.731
- Yes, actually.
- How did I know?

28:48.732 --> 28:51.411
But now you're in a long term
relationship with your boyfriend,

28:51.412 --> 28:53.391
you said that, are you going to "marry"?

28:53.392 --> 28:55.864
You know what, I'm going to have to go.

28:55.865 --> 28:58.144
How do you approach the
people you interview?

28:58.169 --> 28:59.092
What?

28:59.117 --> 29:00.672
I mean, do you judge them?

29:01.672 --> 29:04.353
No. Because I want them
to tell the truth.

29:04.378 --> 29:05.950
Do you think you represent them fairly?

29:05.951 --> 29:08.390
Yeah, I hope I have a reputation
that comes from that,

29:08.391 --> 29:09.941
and I always want to portray the truth.

29:09.966 --> 29:11.013
You would never write

29:11.014 --> 29:12.590
something just to attract attention?

29:12.591 --> 29:14.367
- Never.
- Good.

29:14.368 --> 29:17.442
I suppose we're opposite ends
of the spectrum in that regard.

29:17.443 --> 29:19.500
Seeing as I'm queen of the click bait.

29:21.591 --> 29:22.630
Yeah.

29:22.631 --> 29:26.470
He's the most principled journalist
at the Herald. Everyone knows it.

29:26.471 --> 29:28.590
Well, this is what I've heard.

29:28.591 --> 29:32.046
I was hoping for a sort
of wide-ranging interview.

29:32.047 --> 29:34.270
A profile piece, within which
I will make my confession.

29:34.271 --> 29:36.614
- Would that work for you?
- It depends what you've done.

29:37.460 --> 29:39.651
All right, I think I've seen enough.

29:39.674 --> 29:41.189
Honestly, he's really good!

29:41.214 --> 29:42.774
Yeah, I know.

29:42.775 --> 29:45.310
I mean, his politics are utter
fantasy and I wish he'd get

29:45.311 --> 29:47.550
better shoes, but I can see
he believes in what he does.

29:47.551 --> 29:48.640
Which is all we need.

29:48.665 --> 29:50.624
- We?
- Yeah.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.990
I'm ready to tell you both the truth.

29:53.991 --> 29:56.216
- What?
- What do you mean?

29:56.241 --> 29:58.380
I'm not what I seem.

30:04.691 --> 30:06.902
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

30:25.311 --> 30:27.031
Oh, hey, Holly!

30:28.270 --> 30:30.669
- Is Amina around?
- Er, they've just left. What's going on?

30:30.670 --> 30:32.600
We've got something. I
think you'll like it.

30:32.625 --> 30:33.788
What? Where have you been?

30:33.789 --> 30:34.949
We went to have lunch with Wendy Bolt.

30:34.950 --> 30:36.486
Wendy Bolt?

30:36.511 --> 30:38.678
She wanted to see James to vet him.
She said she had

30:38.679 --> 30:40.715
a big confession and she wanted to
make sure he was as principled

30:40.716 --> 30:42.927
as everyone said. So she asked him
all these questions...

30:42.928 --> 30:45.115
We don't want a Wendy Bolt story.

30:45.116 --> 30:48.789
And then, at the end,
she says she'll tell us the truth.

30:48.790 --> 30:51.959
It's not a story about her,
it's a story about her friend.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.959
- Who's her friend?
- Joshua West.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.336
They know each other from charity things.

30:56.337 --> 30:58.885
She feels sorry for him, for
some reason he wanted James to

30:58.886 --> 31:01.612
interview him, and they worked out
they had me as a connection.

31:01.612 --> 31:03.571
He's up for coming in tomorrow
for an interview.

31:03.572 --> 31:06.120
- He asked for you specifically?
- Yeah.

31:06.971 --> 31:09.062
- This is...
- What?

31:11.612 --> 31:13.731
OK, what questions are you
going to ask him?

31:13.732 --> 31:16.651
We'll ask about what he's done,
about the women.

31:16.652 --> 31:19.331
He'll tell you what he's done,
it's all out there.

31:19.332 --> 31:22.011
He'll say although it's not
illegal, he'll point that out,

31:22.012 --> 31:24.491
although it's not illegal he can
see how much harm it's done to

31:24.492 --> 31:25.811
those women and to his family.

31:25.812 --> 31:28.571
We'll ask him about abusing
his position of power.

31:28.572 --> 31:29.853
He'll say he's addicted to sex

31:29.878 --> 31:31.948
and it's a problem he's
entering rehabilitation for. What else?

31:31.949 --> 31:33.851
- I thought you wanted to go after him?
- I do.

31:33.852 --> 31:36.811
Precisely because at the moment, it
appears nothing will actually stick.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.371
The Post's dropping this tomorrow,

31:38.372 --> 31:40.486
if he can ride it out one more day,
get the most respected

31:40.487 --> 31:43.491
journalist at the Herald to
interview him, he's home and dry.

31:43.492 --> 31:46.452
It's a PR exercise. Isn't that obvious?

31:47.240 --> 31:50.088
You know, even if he thinks it's a
PR thing, it's an opportunity.

31:50.089 --> 31:52.536
I'll do my best, I will work
on the questions tonight.

31:52.537 --> 31:56.212
- You are doing him a favour.
- It's my job to make sure that I'm not.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.860
OK, night.

32:08.638 --> 32:10.758
- What did she say? Your wife?
- Not much.

32:11.812 --> 32:14.411
I told her I had to work late
and be in early tomorrow,

32:14.412 --> 32:15.971
with everything that's going on.

32:15.972 --> 32:17.891
She was very understanding, actually.

32:17.892 --> 32:22.771
I assume you want to talk about
today? About you resigning.

32:22.772 --> 32:25.531
You should apply
for the job when I leave.

32:25.532 --> 32:28.604
I haven't got any desire to replace you.

32:28.629 --> 32:29.942
Do you know where I'm going?

32:29.943 --> 32:34.512
The London Opera. Chief Executive.
Chance to open the whole place up.

32:34.513 --> 32:36.891
Make a difference.
Make it more accessible.

32:36.892 --> 32:39.491
Opera. HE CHUCKLES

32:39.492 --> 32:42.651
Is this... is this a game
that you're playing with me?

32:42.652 --> 32:43.692
No.

32:44.311 --> 32:47.091
You're going to leave the
Herald and run an opera house?

32:47.092 --> 32:49.411
I've been on the board a few years,
I know my way round.

32:49.412 --> 32:51.291
- It is what people do.
- Not you.

32:51.292 --> 32:54.971
Well, I've already given
my resignation in, so...

32:54.972 --> 32:56.611
But they haven't accepted it yet.

32:56.612 --> 32:58.371
You can e-mail first thing
and withdraw it.

32:58.372 --> 32:59.731
Get on the front foot tomorrow.

32:59.732 --> 33:01.811
I've had enough of responsibility.

33:01.812 --> 33:05.131
- You thrive on responsibility.
- Clearly not any more.

33:05.132 --> 33:08.291
Look at what I'm doing. You're married.

33:08.292 --> 33:10.548
I asked you to come here and you did.

33:10.549 --> 33:12.771
But you're married
to someone really nice.

33:12.772 --> 33:14.360
I'm didn't come here...

33:14.385 --> 33:16.804
You know why you're here. We both know.

33:18.392 --> 33:21.900
Don't you ever think, "Just let go"?

33:21.925 --> 33:26.833
Don't you ever want to stop
thinking things through?

33:28.772 --> 33:30.651
Amina.

33:30.652 --> 33:32.331
Stop.

33:32.332 --> 33:34.731
- Stop.
- Why?

33:34.732 --> 33:36.571
- Stop, stop, stop!
- Why?!

33:36.572 --> 33:37.891
Because, unlike Joshua West,

33:37.892 --> 33:41.372
I don't get off on having sex
with vulnerable people.

33:52.140 --> 33:53.692
Well...

33:54.060 --> 33:57.980
I want to get drunk. Let's drink.

33:58.532 --> 34:00.140
I should go.

34:01.058 --> 34:02.458
I'm going to go.

34:05.372 --> 34:08.860
Hey! Hey, hey! Hey! Hey, hey!

34:10.012 --> 34:12.731
Put the plate down, put the plate
down, put the plate down,

34:12.732 --> 34:14.580
put the plate down, come on. Come on.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.212
Hey.

34:27.092 --> 34:31.132
- It's all a mess.
- Then do something!

36:20.012 --> 36:21.012
Can I join?

36:25.412 --> 36:26.932
Sure.

36:38.519 --> 36:42.060
- You're Joshua West.
- That's right, and who are you?

36:43.092 --> 36:45.120
Hermione Granger, shhh.

36:45.145 --> 36:49.698
- All right, how can I help?
- I want to talk.

36:50.214 --> 36:53.543
Police, fan, journalist?

36:53.568 --> 36:55.916
- A concerned citizen.
- Why concerned?

36:57.020 --> 37:02.671
Well... they say... you're being
hounded by the paparazzi,

37:02.696 --> 37:04.651
thrown out of your marital home,
hanging your head in shame.

37:04.652 --> 37:08.371
But I was walking home, thinking,
no, that's not your style.

37:08.372 --> 37:10.651
"He made that statement.
He's very careful.

37:10.652 --> 37:13.500
"He would've had that approved
by his family before he did it."

37:14.692 --> 37:18.140
Your marriage is fine. Isn't it?

37:18.932 --> 37:21.612
You're in here so they,
they don't chase your wife and kids.

37:22.772 --> 37:24.451
You've got costly lawyers, advisers.

37:24.452 --> 37:26.811
They would have said, "You haven't
done anything illegal,

37:26.812 --> 37:28.891
"just issue an apology,
wait till the wind changes

37:28.892 --> 37:31.691
- "and then carry on, as you were."
- Why does it matter to you?

37:31.692 --> 37:33.851
I believe in standards in public life.

37:33.852 --> 37:36.971
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- The women beg to differ.

37:36.972 --> 37:39.411
Nothing illegal. The women were adults.

37:39.412 --> 37:41.691
- Do you want us to...?
- No, it's OK.

37:41.692 --> 37:44.286
- Are you recording this conversation?
- No.

37:46.645 --> 37:51.260
OK... journalist.
I can sense your judgment of me.

37:52.612 --> 37:56.452
But you have no idea. Of how I live.

37:57.492 --> 38:00.491
Of this world. I can tell.

38:00.492 --> 38:06.060
By your jumper. Your shoes.
The quality of your skin.

38:07.612 --> 38:11.531
This is all a dream for you
and it always will be.

38:11.532 --> 38:14.451
And you come here and you think
it seems a fantasy,

38:14.452 --> 38:17.371
but let me tell you
this is the real world.

38:17.372 --> 38:21.211
Rooms like this are where
real decisions are made.

38:21.212 --> 38:24.772
People like you will only
ever get a glimpse of it.

38:26.540 --> 38:28.100
It's obscene.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.212
It's magic.

38:31.651 --> 38:37.020
Things can happen... but with
a word from me, they didn't.

38:39.492 --> 38:40.492
Hey...

38:42.252 --> 38:43.892
Like this.

38:45.812 --> 38:48.340
And it seems you ARE recording it.

38:49.252 --> 38:53.131
How were you planning to use that?
Secret recording's illegal.

38:53.132 --> 38:55.292
- There's ways.
- Tell me.

38:56.852 --> 38:58.531
You leak it to a foreign website,

38:58.532 --> 39:00.731
they put it on the internet,
you report that.

39:00.732 --> 39:01.971
You lose some of the credit

39:01.972 --> 39:04.332
but at least you get
to break the story legally.

39:04.839 --> 39:06.039
Fascinating.

39:08.772 --> 39:10.531
You see, it's magic.

39:10.532 --> 39:13.331
You think this is happening,
but it isn't. It didn't.

39:13.332 --> 39:14.851
No-one here saw anything.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.851
No-one here knows
what happened to your phone.

39:17.852 --> 39:19.412
Stand up, please.

39:19.918 --> 39:21.638
I'd do as he asks.

39:27.452 --> 39:30.091
In case you're finding this
intrusive, or demeaning,

39:30.092 --> 39:32.580
don't worry, it isn't happening.

39:34.012 --> 39:40.380
You're a journalist. I can smell it.
What paper? Ah, doesn't matter.

39:41.252 --> 39:44.011
You wanted to record me
saying dubious things.

39:44.012 --> 39:46.940
That's why you came here. Lied to me.

39:47.572 --> 39:49.812
I came to look you in the eye.

39:51.092 --> 39:56.540
Well, now you have. And all your
worst suspicions are confirmed.

39:56.932 --> 39:59.660
But nothing you can prove.

40:00.692 --> 40:02.820
Power trumps everything.

40:04.092 --> 40:08.332
You know how you have
to go outside to smoke?

40:42.492 --> 40:46.011
- How's the key working for you?
- Good, thank you.

40:46.012 --> 40:47.960
You can come here whenever you want.

40:47.985 --> 40:51.620
- I don't want to intrude.
- You won't.

40:58.172 --> 40:59.811
What?

40:59.812 --> 41:04.011
- What do you want me to do?
- Just... whatever.

41:04.012 --> 41:09.732
- Make yourself a drink, put the TV on.
- OK?

41:09.852 --> 41:11.812
I've got this to be getting on with.

41:22.012 --> 41:24.940
- Is this a game?
- No.

41:26.412 --> 41:30.203
You want me to distract you
from your important work?

41:30.204 --> 41:31.390
It is important, actually.

41:31.391 --> 41:35.531
It's the sales breakdown for the
final quarter. It's interesting.

41:35.532 --> 41:37.492
You want to tell me about it?

41:39.652 --> 41:42.220
No, I... I just want to read it.

41:54.372 --> 41:55.852
Why did you call me?

41:57.412 --> 42:00.211
- Are you staying the night?
- If you want.

42:00.212 --> 42:04.452
Good, so take your boots off. Just,
just chill out and do what you want.

42:09.772 --> 42:13.892
- Have you had a good day?
- Yes, you?

42:16.972 --> 42:19.660
Actually... yes.

42:21.732 --> 42:24.420
- Thanks for asking.
- No problem.

42:39.245 --> 42:40.245
Back late.

42:59.172 --> 43:01.492
I haven't had sex in eight months.

43:06.492 --> 43:08.612
- Right.
- We were going to have sex.

43:10.092 --> 43:12.860
- Yeah.
- What happened?

43:14.332 --> 43:18.700
- Er... you were really drunk.
- I'm not drunk now.

43:30.812 --> 43:35.652
- Is that good? Is that good?
- Shh, shh, shh.

44:13.612 --> 44:15.052
Right.

44:20.292 --> 44:21.891
It's a bit early, isn't it?

44:21.892 --> 44:25.171
I used to smoke 20 a day.

44:25.172 --> 44:28.700
- I mean to be working.
- Not for me.

44:32.772 --> 44:34.660
Has something happened?

44:35.212 --> 44:38.451
- You need to move out.
- Sorry?

44:38.452 --> 44:42.193
Right now. Cos I'm working
and I can't trust you.

44:42.194 --> 44:44.412
I can't have you around here any more.

44:44.860 --> 44:45.901
But you said...

44:45.926 --> 44:47.626
You were doing your job,
and I understand that

44:47.627 --> 44:49.251
you were thinking practically.
Well, I'm doing the same.

44:49.252 --> 44:51.812
It's not practical to have you here
in case you do it again.

44:54.932 --> 44:56.483
Like you said, I'm better off alone.

44:56.508 --> 44:58.660
- But last night...
- Was really good.

45:01.805 --> 45:03.205
Now you go.

45:52.692 --> 45:55.060
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:55.972 --> 45:58.570
Look, I know yesterday was difficult,

45:58.571 --> 46:01.691
but we are back on track today,
so business as usual.

46:01.692 --> 46:03.082
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

46:05.412 --> 46:06.812
- Hey.
- Hi.

46:10.311 --> 46:11.911
Hi.

46:19.052 --> 46:22.531
We spoke to Amina last night
and she agreed so he's coming in,

46:22.532 --> 46:24.331
and he's going to be here in 20 minutes.

46:24.332 --> 46:26.331
It's too good an
opportunity to turn down.

46:26.332 --> 46:29.411
- Even if the chance of him...
- Ask him about that instead.

46:29.412 --> 46:33.411
I got up early and did some work.
Work that Amina told me not to do.

46:33.412 --> 46:35.492
Work that isn't actually my job.

46:35.980 --> 46:38.131
I ask him about this,
he's going to leave immediately.

46:38.132 --> 46:40.682
What's the alternative, James,
that you don't ask him?

46:40.707 --> 46:41.821
What is it?

46:44.252 --> 46:46.075
Come on, I've worked hard for this.

46:47.573 --> 46:48.684
Well, we have to.

47:14.812 --> 47:16.372
What now?

47:18.372 --> 47:23.131
Just touring my favourite
organization. I find it fascinating.

47:23.132 --> 47:26.371
- You're distracting them.
- Nonsense.

47:26.372 --> 47:27.940
And even if I am...

47:28.985 --> 47:30.225
I own them.

47:37.972 --> 47:40.611
To what do I owe this reappearance?

47:40.612 --> 47:43.691
You've upset our Prime Minister
and I want you to apologise.

47:43.692 --> 47:48.260
Nothing public, you won't lose face.
Just give him a call, say sorry.

47:49.372 --> 47:51.620
- We get back to normal.
- I'm doing my job.

47:52.732 --> 47:54.443
Journalism, just what you wanted.

47:54.468 --> 47:57.876
- I know, but he's proud.
- Me too!

47:57.972 --> 47:59.651
Proud as they get.

47:59.652 --> 48:02.211
- Sorry isn't in my vocabulary.
- Well, it needs to be.

48:02.212 --> 48:06.103
- Are you joking?
- This is my serious face.

48:08.172 --> 48:10.891
He also said there was a story
you promised to keep quiet.

48:10.892 --> 48:12.267
I don't know what you're talking about.

48:12.292 --> 48:13.491
Oh, you do,

48:13.492 --> 48:16.051
and I'd like you to keep that promise.

48:16.052 --> 48:18.877
- Where's this coming from?
- We have business together.

48:18.878 --> 48:20.781
You're going to support
him in the election.

48:20.806 --> 48:21.851
Business together.

48:21.852 --> 48:26.860
And you're a spanner in our works.
So apologise and move on, all right?

48:27.652 --> 48:31.692
- No.
- To keep your ego intact...

48:32.260 --> 48:36.211
we both pretend... you don't have a boss,

48:36.212 --> 48:38.251
that you have complete freedom,

48:38.252 --> 48:40.540
but the reality is Duncan...

48:41.692 --> 48:43.652
I own you too.

48:48.932 --> 48:55.060
Use my phone. This is his number.
You'll get straight through.

48:58.012 --> 49:02.300
I don't ask for much. I really don't.

49:46.580 --> 49:48.504
You don't mind about the camera?

49:48.505 --> 49:51.000
- You did agree we could film it?
- Absolutely.

49:51.732 --> 49:54.011
Sorry about the subterfuge
in setting this up.

49:54.012 --> 49:55.891
I had to be sure I could trust you.

49:55.892 --> 49:59.771
And Wendy, for all her flaws,
is pretty good at judging people.

49:59.772 --> 50:01.140
Tell me about it.

50:06.772 --> 50:09.291
Now, obviously, there's been a lot
in the press over the last

50:09.292 --> 50:12.195
couple of days about the women
who have come forward and accused you

50:12.196 --> 50:14.411
of grooming them, sleeping with them.

50:14.412 --> 50:16.771
I believe there's 16 now.

50:16.772 --> 50:19.211
Yes. And, as I've said, I'm deeply sorry.

50:19.212 --> 50:24.060
Although nothing I did was illegal,
I know how much it's hurt people.

50:25.892 --> 50:29.502
There's no excusing it,
and I don't intend to.

50:29.527 --> 50:30.691
Right.

50:30.692 --> 50:34.211
I want to start by asking you
about one woman in particular,

50:34.212 --> 50:36.932
who I don't think has come
forward before now.

50:38.531 --> 50:40.700
- All right.
- Sheena Patel.

50:41.892 --> 50:44.451
- You know the name?
- Yes, I know Sheena.

50:44.452 --> 50:47.197
So you and her had a relationship?

50:47.222 --> 50:49.564
- Yes.
- Slept together?

50:50.732 --> 50:52.651
Yes, we did.

50:52.652 --> 50:56.371
But she wasn't on the trainee
programme, like the others?

50:56.372 --> 50:57.540
I...

50:58.605 --> 50:59.845
Perhaps she...

51:01.372 --> 51:04.171
No, I don't believe she was.

51:04.172 --> 51:06.731
Actually, you met at a party, I think.

51:06.732 --> 51:08.660
Can you tell me when that was?

51:11.532 --> 51:13.576
I can't remember exactly.

51:13.601 --> 51:16.796
- Well, it's 13 years ago.
- If you say so.

51:16.932 --> 51:20.652
- She's now 28 years old.
- Right.

51:23.532 --> 51:26.100
Which means she was 15 when you met her.

51:30.578 --> 51:32.500
That's right, isn't it?

51:34.772 --> 51:36.451
Have you spoken to her?

51:36.452 --> 51:39.051
Yeah, one of my colleagues
spoke to her this morning.

51:39.052 --> 51:43.331
She claims that you slept with her
shortly after that party.

51:43.332 --> 51:48.340
That you slept with her when
she was 15. Is that right?

51:51.172 --> 51:54.491
Sheena is a vulnerable person.
What makes you say that?

51:54.492 --> 51:58.931
She... I'm surprised
that she spoke to you.

51:58.932 --> 52:02.451
I'm sure, as you've been paying
her large amounts of money

52:02.452 --> 52:04.251
for the last ten years.

52:04.252 --> 52:06.851
And you helped fund her
university education,

52:06.852 --> 52:09.251
you helped her start her own business.

52:09.252 --> 52:11.011
It's very generous.

52:11.012 --> 52:13.531
I didn't sleep with her
when she was underage.

52:13.532 --> 52:19.260
She says you did. And she's got some
e-mails from you, around that time.

52:33.185 --> 52:34.905
I don't recognise these.

52:35.692 --> 52:38.091
Well, there's also some e-mails,

52:38.092 --> 52:42.220
which seem to imply that you wanted
her to keep some kind of a secret.

53:00.860 --> 53:02.971
I'm going to finish this now.

53:02.972 --> 53:05.131
These are accusations
of something criminal.

53:05.132 --> 53:06.731
They are in fact libellous.

53:06.732 --> 53:09.451
Only if they're not true. You did
agree I could ask you anything.

53:09.452 --> 53:12.900
But this is a legal matter. I'm
going to need to consult my lawyers.

53:19.852 --> 53:23.420
And here I am. Magic.

54:13.412 --> 54:13.492
They just told me, well done. Thanks.

54:13.493 --> 54:16.731
- They just told me, well done.
- Thanks.

54:16.732 --> 54:18.274
You must've worked all night.

54:18.299 --> 54:20.931
- Yeah. Early start.
- Amazing.

54:20.932 --> 54:23.292
And you got what you wanted.
Something to pin on him.

54:24.692 --> 54:26.052
That's right.

54:29.212 --> 54:31.411
Holly. Do we have a problem?

54:31.412 --> 54:33.371
You told me not to look into it.

54:33.372 --> 54:35.851
The only reason that Sheena's story
was told properly

54:35.852 --> 54:40.171
- is because I ignored you.
- All right. Well, I'm sorry...

54:40.172 --> 54:42.771
If I hadn't done that, the whole
paper would have been used

54:42.772 --> 54:45.940
to restore the reputation of a man
who's abused at least 15 women.

54:47.420 --> 54:50.651
- Are you resigning?
- No. I've thought about it overnight

54:50.652 --> 54:52.651
and I think it's important
that I keep going.

54:52.652 --> 54:54.409
- That we all keep going.
- I was saying that yesterday.

54:54.410 --> 54:56.601
Before you put the apology
on the front page.

54:56.602 --> 54:58.412
- You're angry.
- Oh, you noticed.

55:00.732 --> 55:03.140
Look, do you want to come into my office?

55:18.972 --> 55:21.620
- What's the problem?
- Holly?

55:23.012 --> 55:25.140
You're not resigning, good for you.

55:26.492 --> 55:27.731
But I am.

55:27.732 --> 55:29.891
- Holly...
- I'll work my notice if you want me to,

55:29.892 --> 55:33.051
but I would rather just leave now.

55:33.052 --> 55:35.811
- Why?
- Because this whole thing is a mess.

55:35.812 --> 55:39.731
We think that we're better,
but we're not, we're just naive.

55:39.732 --> 55:44.416
Ignoring the obvious. Out of date.
Slowly fucking dying.

55:44.417 --> 55:47.412
The Herald won't exist in two
years' time and you know that.

55:47.660 --> 55:49.049
Why are you pretending?

55:49.074 --> 55:50.796
- That's why things are going to change.
- Yeah.

55:53.212 --> 55:55.651
Everybody knows you're sleeping together.

55:55.652 --> 55:57.740
You think you're hiding it
but you're not.

55:59.060 --> 56:00.491
It's embarrassing.

56:00.492 --> 56:03.171
Holly, you have clearly been
finding things difficult...

56:03.172 --> 56:04.731
I don't want to talk about it.

56:04.732 --> 56:06.451
Perhaps some time away would be useful...

56:06.452 --> 56:09.860
No, I want to go for good, right now.

56:13.292 --> 56:15.412
- All right.
- Thanks.

56:17.652 --> 56:18.852
Stop her.

56:23.412 --> 56:25.500
- Stop her!
- No.

56:26.652 --> 56:28.451
Holly, Holly!

56:28.452 --> 56:29.732
Holly.

56:33.532 --> 56:34.451
What's going on?

56:34.476 --> 56:37.091
- I've told Amina that I've had enough.
- What?

56:37.092 --> 56:38.160
I'm leaving.

56:38.185 --> 56:40.731
Why? Everybody's talking
about what just happened.

56:40.732 --> 56:42.663
You got him. He can't
come back from that.

56:42.688 --> 56:43.971
No?

56:43.972 --> 56:47.291
I told her that it would make a
difference. He'll be on the phone

56:47.292 --> 56:50.411
right now to his lawyer, making
every effort to undermine her story.

56:50.412 --> 56:52.460
We have no fucking power at all!

57:50.798 --> 57:52.758
Holly Evans.

57:52.932 --> 57:54.451
Make me an offer.

57:56.452 --> 57:58.144
Did you hear Holly's started at the Post?

57:58.169 --> 57:59.411
Oh, Holly, no!

57:59.412 --> 58:01.040
- Why are you here?
- I work here.

58:01.065 --> 58:02.128
Special correspondent.

58:02.129 --> 58:03.731
What bothers you so much?

58:03.732 --> 58:05.611
That I threw you out or
I slept with you first?

58:05.612 --> 58:07.971
There were three stories I wanted
to follow when I was at the Herald,

58:07.972 --> 58:09.691
but the people involved wanted money.

58:09.692 --> 58:12.531
- But we're not so squeamish.
- A young Syrian called Adnan Homsi.

58:12.532 --> 58:15.251
There's something else I want you to
start with. Find out what that is.

58:15.252 --> 58:17.756
Said it might compromise the PM.

58:17.781 --> 58:19.611
You wrote the Lyon's story yesterday.

58:19.612 --> 58:21.200
- Yeah.
- Vicious.

58:21.225 --> 58:22.731
What, he puts three
people in the hospital,

58:22.732 --> 58:24.491
but we're bullying him?

58:24.492 --> 58:27.412
Today's saying our front page may
have been a contributing factor.
