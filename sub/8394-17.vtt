WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.308
- IS THIS A TRIAL SEPARATION

00:02.340 --> 00:04.274
WITH THE HOPES
OF RECONCILIATION?

00:04.310 --> 00:07.996
- I-I DON'T--
NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.

00:08.040 --> 00:09.177
- OKAY.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.347
- I DON'T GET YOU, DREW.

00:10.380 --> 00:13.452
YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND COMES
AND BASICALLY LIVES WITH YOU--

00:13.490 --> 00:15.003
- I SAID I WANTED
A RELATIONSHIP.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.484
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO BE FRIENDS,

00:16.530 --> 00:17.838
WHICH IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

00:17.870 --> 00:18.871
- I GOT TO GO.
I HAVE CLASS.

00:18.910 --> 00:21.083
- WE COULD, UH, YOU KNOW,
DO THE JOB TOGETHER.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.769
- JUST LIKE WE USED TO.

00:22.810 --> 00:24.084
- EXCEPT THAT I'M THE BOSS.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.189
- [chuckles] YEAH.

00:25.230 --> 00:26.709
- THIS IS BETWEEN ME
AND YOUR FATHER.

00:26.750 --> 00:28.251
- YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S TRYING
TO SELL THIS HOUSE

00:28.300 --> 00:29.642
OUT FROM UNDER
THE ENTIRE FAMILY.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.988
VERY SELFISH!

00:31.030 --> 00:33.544
WE HAVE AN ATTACHMENT
TO THIS PLACE.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.477
- I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
PROCRASTINATE ANY LONGER.

00:36.510 --> 00:38.546
IT'S HAPPENING SUNDAY.
- MOM, I KNOW YOU WANT

00:38.590 --> 00:40.751
TO GET THIS DONE,
BUT IT'S VERY BAD TIMING FOR US.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.441
- IT'S VERY, VERY BAD TIMING
JUST ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:43.490 --> 00:44.889
- YEAH.
- IT'S NOT LIKE I'M ASKING

00:44.940 --> 00:46.453
TO GET THE BABY A HAIRCUT.

00:46.490 --> 00:48.720
THIS IS AIDA'S SOUL
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:48.770 --> 00:50.931
- RENEE, WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
IT IS TO YOU,

00:50.980 --> 00:52.004
AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

00:52.050 --> 00:53.278
WE WILL DO IT.
- YEAH.

00:54.190 --> 00:56.283
- JASMINE,
YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR ME?

00:56.330 --> 00:58.946
- NO. NO!
- BECAUSE I RECALL YOUR SAYING

00:58.980 --> 01:01.016
THAT JABBAR'S BAPTISM WAS ONE
OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS

01:01.060 --> 01:03.369
OF YOUR LIFE.
- AND IT WAS, MOM,

01:03.400 --> 01:04.708
BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT, MOM.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.479
I'M IN A MARRIAGE NOW
AND LIVING WITH MY IN-LAWS.

01:06.510 --> 01:07.989
WE'RE NOT IN OUR OWN SPACE.

01:08.030 --> 01:09.258
WE CAN'T HOST A BRUNCH
OR DO ANYTHING.

01:09.310 --> 01:10.504
IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT TIME.

01:10.550 --> 01:12.063
- CAMILLE IS A WONDERFUL HOST.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.965
SHE WOULD LOVE TO PUT OUT
SOME MUFFINS

01:14.000 --> 01:16.207
FOR HER GRANDBABY'S SALVATION.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.821
- NO, MOM,
THEY'RE SELLING THE HOUSE.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.098
- THE HOUSlaLIS FOR SALE.

01:19.140 --> 01:20.789
YOUR PARENTS ARE SELLING
THEIR HOUSE?

01:21.870 --> 01:23.724
- SO I'LL THROW THE BRUNCH.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

01:23.770 --> 01:24.907
- YOU'RE GONNA
THROW THE BRUNCH. OKAY.

01:24.940 --> 01:27.500
- MOM, YOU LIVE IN A BOX.
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ANYONE.

01:27.530 --> 01:30.875
- A BOX FULL OF LOVE AND JOY
IS A BEAUTIFUL BOX.

01:30.910 --> 01:33.299
- NO.
THERE'S ANOTHER PR--

01:33.330 --> 01:34.115
THERE'S A BIGGER PROBLEM.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.503
- OH, COME ON, GUYS.
- NO, THIS--

01:36.540 --> 01:37.984
- THE GODPARENTS
ARE CURRENTLY SEPARATED.

01:38.020 --> 01:40.500
- YEAH.
- JOEL AND JULIA?

01:40.540 --> 01:42.121
- YEAH. I MEAN, WE HOPE
THAT TH EY'LL GET BACK TOGETHER,

01:42.170 --> 01:44.126
BUT...
- OH, THAT'S SHOCKING.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.718
I'M--I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.512
THEY WERE SO PERFECT.

01:48.550 --> 01:50.654
- WELL, NOW THEY'RE
IN A STATE OF LIMBO, SO...

01:50.690 --> 01:52.169
- WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHERE AIDA WILL BE

01:52.210 --> 01:53.723
IF YOU DON'T GET HER BAPTIZED,

01:53.760 --> 01:56.888
SO YOU TWO NEED TO CHOOSE
A NEW GODFATHER.

01:56.940 --> 01:58.316
- OKAY.

01:58.350 --> 02:02.525
I AM NOT GOING TO UN-ASK JOEL
TO BE THE GODFATHER.

02:02.570 --> 02:04.049
- YEAH, THAT'S CRAZY.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.082
- CROSBY,
YOU DO NOT WANT A GODFATHER

02:06.120 --> 02:08.111
WHO HAS ONE FOOT
OUT THE DOOR.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.129
SO YOU LET ME KNOW.

02:11.160 --> 02:11.910
- SOUNDS VERY SETTLED.

02:11.950 --> 02:16.023
- WE'LL SEE YOU SUNDAY.
- YEP.

02:16.060 --> 02:17.049
- HUG.
- MM. OKAY.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.022
- SEE YOU SUNDAY.
- MM-HMM.

02:19.060 --> 02:21.062
- [gasps] OH!
- THAT'S SO COOL.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.342
- IT LOOKS SO GOOD,
DOESN'T IT?

02:24.380 --> 02:25.688
HUH?
- PRETTY GOOD.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.516
THE NUANCE, THIS IS A--
- OH, EXCEPT THE GREEN.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.312
THEY'RE TOO DARK.
- WELL, I LIKE THE GREENS.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.829
- BUT THE YELLOW HELPS IT.
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU--

02:30.870 --> 02:32.030
YELLOW AND GREEN, RIGHT?
- RIGHT, NO, YOU SAID

02:32.080 --> 02:33.308
THEY'RE LIKE KISSING COUSINS.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.839
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS, THOUGH.

02:34.870 --> 02:36.076
- BUT THEY HELP EACH OTHER OUT.
- LOOK AT THE GRADATION...

02:36.120 --> 02:37.838
- GUYS, THE GREEN IS FINE.
- ON THE YELLOW--IT'S PERFECT.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.279
- WAIT, WAIT.
IT'S A LITTLE OVERSATURATED.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.877
- CAN WE DO THE SAME THING
WITH THE GREEN

02:40.910 --> 02:42.320
THAT WE DID WITH THE YELLOW?
- WHY IS IT OVERSATURATED?

02:42.360 --> 02:43.987
- LET'S PHOTOSHOP IT.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:44.020 --> 02:45.942
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GOT TO DO

02:45.990 --> 02:46.945
WITH THE PROJECT 5--
- I LIKE IT.

02:46.990 --> 02:48.389
- REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
WE DID THAT ON THE--

02:48.440 --> 02:49.987
- RIGHT, EXACTLY.
- GUYS, I'M GONNA KEEP THIS ONE.

02:50.030 --> 02:52.919
- AND LOWER THE SATURATION.
- HOW DOES THIS CUT?

02:52.960 --> 02:54.507
HEY, THIS IS ONLY THREE.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.097
WE HAVE, LIKE,
TEN MORE PAGES TO GO.

02:56.140 --> 02:58.722
- WE GOT TIME.
WE GOT TIME.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.204
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T TOUCH THE MACHINE.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.514
MAKE THEM EVEN.
MAKE THEM EVEN.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.312
MAKE THE CONTOURS
AND THE VIBRANCY EVEN.

03:37.830 --> 03:39.798
- ALL RIGHT.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.284
HELLO.

03:43.250 --> 03:46.185
[rock music playing]

03:51.850 --> 03:52.839
- OH, HEY, DREW.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.087
WHAT'S UP, DUDE?

03:55.130 --> 03:57.121
YOU LOOKING FOR NATALIE?

03:57.160 --> 04:00.266
SHE'S IN HERE.

04:06.210 --> 04:08.792
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

04:08.830 --> 04:11.446
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

04:11.490 --> 04:13.936
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO

04:13.970 --> 04:16.211
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

04:16.250 --> 04:18.935
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

04:18.980 --> 04:20.140
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

04:20.190 --> 04:23.250
AND MAY YOU STAY

04:23.290 --> 04:26.009
FOREVER YOUNG

04:26.050 --> 04:28.496
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

04:28.540 --> 04:30.747
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

04:30.780 --> 04:33.260
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

04:33.300 --> 04:35.473
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

04:35.510 --> 04:38.263
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

04:38.310 --> 04:40.403
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

04:40.450 --> 04:42.338
AND MAY YOU STAY

04:42.380 --> 04:44.234
FOREVER YOUNG

04:44.280 --> 04:47.317
MAY YOU STAY

04:47.350 --> 04:50.763
FOREVER YOUNG

04:52.110 --> 04:53.281
- DON'T CROP IT TOO TIGHT,

04:53.320 --> 04:55.766
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE
HIS MUSCL--MUSCLY BACK.

04:55.810 --> 04:57.254
- WELL, IT'S NOT A STEROID AD,
ALL RIGHT?

04:57.290 --> 04:59.019
IT'S A SURF AD.
- NO, IT'S A SURFBOARD AD,

04:59.050 --> 05:01.086
SO YOU WANT TO SEE A NICE
LOOKING, MUSCLY SURFER.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.530
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S A NICE MUSCLE?

05:02.570 --> 05:04.606
- I THINK IT'S NICE.
- SEE THAT FLEX RIGHT THERE?

05:04.640 --> 05:06.392
THAT'S ALL NATURAL, OKAY?
- WHAT? YOUR FOREARM?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.782
- YEAH.
- IT'S SCARY.

05:07.820 --> 05:09.435
- HANK, I WANT TO USE
THE TILE THING

05:09.480 --> 05:11.232
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE OTHER DAY

05:11.270 --> 05:13.022
TO PRINT THESE YEARBOOK PHOTOS
THAT I TOOK.

05:13.070 --> 05:13.957
- MAX, I DIDN'T THINK--

05:14.000 --> 05:15.137
YOU DON'T COME ON WEDNESDAYS,
DO YOU?

05:15.170 --> 05:16.478
- I DON'T COME ON WEDNESDAYS.
- WE'RE WORKING TODAY.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.488
- MY PARENTS SAID IF IT'S OKAY
WITH HANK, IT'S OKAY WITH THEM.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.203
- OH, MAX, DON'T PUT THAT
IN THERE, AHH--OKAY.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.444
YOU CAN'T...
- GOOD. IT'S WORKING.

05:21.490 --> 05:23.412
- MESS WITH--
- THOSE ARE MY CLIPS.

05:23.460 --> 05:24.904
- NOT A GOOD DAY, MAD MAX.
- I'M IN THE MIDDLE

05:24.940 --> 05:26.453
OF A REALLY IMPORTANT JOB.
- YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S OKAY.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.071
I REALLY NEED TO PRINT
THESE THINGS.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.769
- IT'S NOT--
MAX, YOU CAN'T PRINT RIGHT NOW.

05:29.810 --> 05:31.664
MAX, LISTEN TO ME.
- I HAVE A FAIR SOLUTION.

05:31.710 --> 05:33.496
I HAVE A FAIR SOLUTION.
- OKAY. WHAT IS IT?

05:33.540 --> 05:35.019
- I WILL USE THE PRINTER
FOR ONE HOUR,

05:35.050 --> 05:36.085
AND YOU GET IT FOR ONE HOUR.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.849
- MAX, WE ONLY HAVE THE PRINTER
FOR THIS WEEK,

05:37.880 --> 05:39.154
AND WE NEED IT
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.155
- YEAH, I KNOW, WHICH IS WHY
I NEED TO DEVELOP IT RIGHT NOW.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.155
- HOW ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR?
- MOVE, MOVE.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.407
- DON'T PUSH ME
OUT OF MY CHAIR, MAX. MAX!

05:43.440 --> 05:44.668
- TOMORROW, MAX. TOMORROW.
- LISTEN...

05:44.720 --> 05:45.857
- WE'LL DO IT TOMORROW.
- NO, WE'RE NOT

05:45.890 --> 05:47.619
GOING TO DO IT TOMORROW.
- WELL, YOU TELL HIM TOMORROW,

05:47.650 --> 05:50.164
THEN TOMORROW
WE'LL TELL HIM TOMORROW.

05:50.210 --> 05:51.347
- NO, DON'T TELL HIM TOMORROW,

05:51.380 --> 05:52.165
BECAUSE HE REALLY
COUNTS ON THINGS.

05:52.210 --> 05:53.438
HEY, MAX, YOU HAVE
TO LISTEN TO ME.

05:53.490 --> 05:54.684
LOOK AT MY EYES.
- WHAT? NO.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.482
YOU'RE BEING COMPLETELY SELFISH.
- TODAY IS NOT A GOOD DAY.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.384
- YOU'RE BEING REALLY,
REALLY SELFISH.

05:57.420 --> 05:58.967
- WE NEED YOU TO COME BACK
NEXT WEEK.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.386
- OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
DON'T PRINT IT.

06:00.420 --> 06:01.239
OH, HE PRINTED IT.
- HON, I THINK YOU SHOULD

06:01.290 --> 06:02.382
GO HOME.
- I CAN'T GO HOME RIGHT NOW.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.250
THE NEXT BUS DOESN'T LEAVE
FOR ANOTHER 45 MINUTES,

06:04.290 --> 06:05.427
SO I'M AT LEAST GONNA
USE IT UNTIL THEN.

06:05.460 --> 06:07.041
- THIS IS NOT WORKING.
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU HOME, THEN.

06:07.090 --> 06:08.159
- NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S HANK'S STUDIO.

06:08.190 --> 06:09.839
- IT'S OKAY. IT'S FASTER FOR ME
TO RUN HIM HOME

06:09.880 --> 06:11.256
THAN TO LET HIM--
- YOU CAN'T TAKE ME HOME.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.676
THIS IS HANK'S STUDIO.
- COME ON.

06:12.710 --> 06:14.154
- IT'S HANK'S STUDIO.
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.428
- HEY, MAX, LISTEN,
WE'RE GOING HOME RIGHT NOW.

06:15.470 --> 06:16.812
STOP THAT.
- NO.

06:16.850 --> 06:18.545
- HEY, BUDDY, COME ON, LET'S GO.
- WHAT? LET GO.

06:18.580 --> 06:19.854
- WE'RE GOING HOME.
WELL, I JUST--

06:19.890 --> 06:22.131
- SORRY, IT'S JUST NOT
A GOOD DAY TODAY.

06:22.170 --> 06:23.512
- DON'T LET HIM RUN.
HE'S FAST.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.030
- I KNOW.
MAX, SLOW DOWN. HEY!

06:26.070 --> 06:28.482
- OH, HE'S RUNNING.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.340
[overlapping arguing]

06:30.390 --> 06:31.618
- AUNT SARAH IS A FASCIST!

06:31.660 --> 06:33.412
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M A FASCIST.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.485
YOU CAN'T KEEP CALLING ME THAT.
- BECAUSE YOU'RE A FASCIST!

06:35.530 --> 06:36.667
- HI.
- I'M SO SORRY.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.260
WE HAD A RUN-IN...
- MAX!

06:39.290 --> 06:40.188
- SHE WOULDN'T LET ME
USE THE PRINTER!

06:40.220 --> 06:42.324
- I COULDN'T LET HIM USE
THE PRINTER TODAY

06:42.360 --> 06:43.702
BECAUSE WE'RE UNDER
A VERY STRICT DEADLINE--

06:43.740 --> 06:45.253
- MAX, HONEY.
- NO, SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.187
I PROPOSED A FAIR SOLUTION.
- HONEY...

06:46.230 --> 06:48.221
- NO ONE'S LISTENING TO ME.
OKAY. BYE!

06:48.260 --> 06:49.579
- BUDDY...
- SEE YOU, MAX.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.669
- WHAT HAPPENED?

06:54.370 --> 06:57.089
- OH, CAMILLE, I'LL DO THAT.
LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT.

06:57.140 --> 06:58.584
- NO, I'M JUST ABOUT DONE.

06:58.620 --> 06:59.609
- PLEASE, IT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO.

06:59.660 --> 07:01.514
YOU DO SO MUCH FOR US.

07:01.550 --> 07:03.893
- [laughs]
OH...

07:03.940 --> 07:06.488
- I CAN DO THIS, AND, YOU KNOW,
WE DO APPRECIATE IT.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.657
I KNOW IT'S--
IT ISN'T EASY FOR YOU.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.863
- OH, WHAT, HAVING YOU HERE?

07:10.910 --> 07:12.389
- MM-HMM.

07:12.430 --> 07:15.251
- [chuckles]
OF COURSE IT'S EASY.

07:15.290 --> 07:17.178
WE LOVE HAVING YOU HERE.

07:17.220 --> 07:20.678
I JUST WISH CROSBY
HAD A LITTLE MORE EMPATHY.

07:20.710 --> 07:23.508
- HE DOES, CAMILLE.
HE DOES.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.644
YOU KNOW,
HE'S HAVING A HARD TIME

07:25.680 --> 07:27.989
LETTING GO, YOU KNOW?

07:28.030 --> 07:29.679
HE GREW UP HERE.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.518
- RIGHT.

07:32.550 --> 07:33.687
- UM...

07:33.720 --> 07:35.608
MY MOTHER HAS DECIDED

07:35.660 --> 07:38.208
THAT AIDA'S SOUL
IS IN GRAVE DANGER

07:38.250 --> 07:39.729
OF BEING STRANDED
WITH THE SINNERS

07:39.760 --> 07:42.456
IF SHE IS NOT BAPTIZED
THIS SUNDAY.

07:42.490 --> 07:43.832
- OOH.
THAT'S KIND OF HARSH.

07:43.870 --> 07:45.838
- YEAH, IT IS.

07:45.870 --> 07:47.622
SO WE JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

07:47.670 --> 07:49.809
THAT WE WON'T INCONVENIENCE YOU
AT ALL WITH ANYTHING.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.979
YOU KNOW, SHE IS BEYOND THRILLED
TO HOST THE BRUNCH

07:52.020 --> 07:54.807
AFTER THE CEREMONY, SO YOU
DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.602
- THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
AN INCONVENIENCE.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.699
I WOULD HAVE LOVED
TO HOST A BRUNCH.

07:58.750 --> 07:59.774
I WOULD LOVE TO HOST
THE BRUNCH.

07:59.820 --> 08:02.471
- I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON.

08:02.510 --> 08:03.613
JUST, YOU KNOW,
WE TOOK CARE OF IT.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.958
- REALLY? I--
- ALL YOU NEED TO DO

08:05.000 --> 08:06.991
IS BE OUR GUEST.
THAT'S ALL YOU DO.

08:07.030 --> 08:07.997
THAT'S IT.
EASY.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.919
[rock music playing]

08:21.290 --> 08:23.758
- HEY.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.777
SO THERE IS A PARTY

08:27.810 --> 08:30.256

08:30.300 --> 08:31.744
YOU WANT TO GO?

08:31.780 --> 08:34.157

08:38.620 --> 08:41.851
- DUDE, ARE YOU MAD?

08:41.900 --> 08:43.822
'CAUSE I'M KIND OF GETTING
A VIBE.

08:43.860 --> 08:45.862
- YEAH, I'M MAD, BERTO.
- OH, MY GOD.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.721
DUDE, I'M SO SORRY I DRANK
YOUR GATORADE YESTERDAY.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.866
PRACTICE WAS SO INTENSE...
- NO. IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT...

08:51.910 --> 08:53.002
- AND I TOTALLY MEANT
TO REPLACE IT.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.112
- WHICH...IT WAS RUDE,
NOW THAT YOU JUST SAID THAT.

08:56.150 --> 08:58.380
AND MY CASHEW BUTTER
YOU'VE BEEN EATING.

08:58.430 --> 09:00.876
I DON'T EVEN CARE, THOUGH.
- YOU'RE--YOU'RE RIGHT, MAN.

09:00.910 --> 09:03.879
I SHOULD GET
MY OWN CASHEW BUTTER.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.673
- BERTO, I-I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS.

09:06.710 --> 09:09.599
IT'S--IT'S NATALIE.

09:09.650 --> 09:13.234
I WAS REALLY SHOCKED
TO SEE YOU GUYS HOOKING UP.

09:13.270 --> 09:15.511
- OH.

09:15.550 --> 09:17.757
OH, MAN, I'M SO SORRY.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.099
I TOTALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE DONE WITH HER.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.415
AND I MEAN, YOU HAD
THAT OTHER CHICK HERE

09:22.450 --> 09:24.839
FOR, LIKE, THREE WEEKS.

09:24.870 --> 09:26.690
- I DON'T EVEN--FORGET IT.

09:26.730 --> 09:28.106
I DON'T CARE.
- NO, NO, NO.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.835
HEY, LOOK, MAN,

09:30.880 --> 09:33.348
IF IT UPSETS YOU THAT MUCH,

09:33.400 --> 09:34.731
I TOTALLY DON'T HAVE
TO HIT THAT.

09:34.780 --> 09:38.329
I MEAN, SHE'S NICE AND ALL,

09:38.370 --> 09:39.746
BUT YOU'RE MY BRO.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.772
- YEAH, IT IS...

09:47.340 --> 09:48.682

THE NEW DIGS, HUH?

09:48.720 --> 09:50.927

09:51.830 --> 09:55.379
IT'S TEMPORARY
UNTIL I FIGURE OUT--

09:55.420 --> 09:58.412
- YEAH.
IT'S GREAT.

09:58.450 --> 09:59.860
- THANK YOU.
- YOUR KIDS ARE--

09:59.900 --> 10:01.527
THEY LIKE IT?
- YEAH, THEY DO, THEY...

10:01.560 --> 10:02.356
WELL, IT'S GOT A POOL, SO...

10:02.390 --> 10:04.494
- YOU CAN'T GO WRONG
WITH A POOL.

10:04.530 --> 10:05.667
- YEAH.
AND THERE'S A GYM

10:05.700 --> 10:07.839
THAT A COUPLE OF THE MACHINES
WORK ON, SO THAT'S GOOD.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.462
- [chuckles]
THAT'S GREAT.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.603
- YEAH.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.608
- I WAS COMING OVER
TO TALK TO YOU.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.813
IT'S AIDA'S,
UH, BAPTISM THING.

10:15.850 --> 10:17.226
- OH, YEAH.
- YEAH.

10:17.270 --> 10:19.716
- IS THAT COMING UP?
- YEAH, SUNDAY.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.638
- WOW.
- I MEAN, I COULD--

10:21.690 --> 10:23.681
PERSONALLY I DON'T REALLY
CARE TOO MU--

10:23.720 --> 10:25.779
I WOULD JUST SPRINKLE WATER
ON HER HEAD AT HOME

10:25.830 --> 10:28.617
AND CALL IT A DAY,
BUT IT'S, YOU KNOW,

10:28.660 --> 10:30.446
REALLY IMPORTANT TO RENEE,

10:30.490 --> 10:32.822
AND IT'S A BIG DEAL.

10:32.870 --> 10:37.079
SO, YOU KNOW,
TH EY--THEY WANTED, UH...

10:37.110 --> 10:39.419
- YEAH, I GET IT.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.189
- YOU DO?
- YEAH.

10:41.220 --> 10:43.780
YEAH, I WOULD BE--
IT WOULD BE AWKWARD FOR ME

10:43.810 --> 10:45.846
TO BE THE GODFATHER

10:45.880 --> 10:47.916
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON, SO...

10:47.950 --> 10:49.884
- I WOULD LOVENFCSJR YOU TO BE--

10:49.920 --> 10:53.048
- IT'S JUST IT COULD BE--

10:53.100 --> 10:55.056
IT COULD BE WEIRD, I GUESS...
- YEAH.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.783
- WITH BOTH.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.469
- WELL, SURE.
- YOU KNOW.

10:58.510 --> 11:01.092
- SURE.
I'M, UH...

11:01.140 --> 11:04.792
YOU KNOW, I'M HONORED
YOU ASKED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.790
- I REALLY HOPE YOU GUYS,

11:08.840 --> 11:11.070
YOU KNOW,
CAN FIND YOUR WAY BACK.

11:11.110 --> 11:13.078
I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,
BUT I JUST, YOU KNOW--

11:13.120 --> 11:15.520
WE LOVE HAVING YOU
IN OUR FAMILY, AND--

11:15.570 --> 11:18.255
- THANKS, BUDDY.
- I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW.

11:18.290 --> 11:19.700
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.117
YEAH,
I'M--I COMPLETELY GET IT.

11:22.160 --> 11:26.199
I DON'T--YOU KNOW, I DON'T
NEED TO BE THE GODFATHER.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.200
- OOH, OOH, SYDNEY,
I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU.

11:37.240 --> 11:40.209
LOOK HOW DIRTY
THOSE HANDS ARE GETTING.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.899
- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE'RE DONE?
- WHEN WE'RE DONE?

11:41.940 --> 11:43.828
WE'RE GONNA DRIVE IT.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.792
- THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY COOL.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.148
- IT'S ALMOST DONE,
ISN'T IT, GRANDPA?

11:47.180 --> 11:49.250
- YES, IT IS. HUH?
- MM-HMM.

11:49.290 --> 11:52.145
- IT'S SO FUN WATCHING THEM WORK
ON THIS CAR, ISN'T IT?

11:52.190 --> 11:54.465
AND IT REMINDS ME
OF MY FAVORITE TIMES WITH HIM.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.842
- OH, MY GOD.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.565
WELL, HE'S SAVING MY LIFE
RIGHT NOW.

11:58.610 --> 12:00.987
[sighs]

12:02.440 --> 12:03.919
- I, UM...

12:03.960 --> 12:05.359
I HAD TO GO OVER TO JOEL'S
THIS AI-TERNOON...

12:05.410 --> 12:08.379
- FOR WHAT?
- TO TALK TO HIM

12:08.410 --> 12:10.207
ABOUT AIDA'S BAPTISM,
WHICH IS THIS SUNDAY.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.129
- YEAH?
- 'CAUSE YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW,

12:13.180 --> 12:14.795
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE GODPARENTS, AND--

12:14.830 --> 12:16.889
- WE'RE NOT GONNA BE
THE GODPARENTS ANYMORE?

12:16.940 --> 12:18.760
- WELL, NO,
YOU'RE GONNA BE THE--

12:18.800 --> 12:21.280
IF YOU HOPEFULLY STILL
WANT TO BE THE GODPARENT.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.312
BUT I THINK I'LL ASK ADAM
TO FILL IN FOR JOEL.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.804
- SO--WAIT.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.559
JOEL'S ALREADY NOT
THE GODFATHER ANYMORE?

12:28.600 --> 12:31.364
- WELL, I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE AN AWKWARD SUNDAY

12:31.400 --> 12:32.776
AT THIS BAPTISM.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.503
I THOUGHT MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
ASKED YOU BEFORE--

12:34.540 --> 12:35.711
- I-I JUST WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

12:35.750 --> 12:38.469
THAT HE WOULD WANT TO BE A PART
OF THE FAMILY, YOU KNOW,

12:38.510 --> 12:43.209
OR HE WOULD NOT WANT
TO NOT BE PART OF THE FAMILY.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.400
- YEAH, I--

12:44.450 --> 12:45.849
- NO--WHAT DID HE SAY?

12:45.900 --> 12:46.821
WHAT DID JOEL SAY ABOUT IT?

12:46.860 --> 12:49.374
- THAT--THAT HE UNDERSTOOD
AND, YOU KNOW,

12:49.420 --> 12:52.480
THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
AIDA'S GODFATHER.

12:52.530 --> 12:54.794
HE WAS--
- SOUNDS LIKE

12:54.840 --> 12:56.831
HE DOES NOT EVEN CARE.

12:56.870 --> 12:58.974
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT HOW--

12:59.010 --> 13:00.637
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WAS AT ALL.
- OKAY.

13:00.670 --> 13:02.661
WELL, WHAT DID YOU--DID YOU TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE?

13:02.710 --> 13:05.156
DID HE ASK ABOUT US?

13:05.190 --> 13:06.942
DID HE--
- WELL, I WASN'T--

13:06.990 --> 13:08.742
I WASN'T THERE THAT LONG.

13:08.780 --> 13:11.852
- HE DIDN'T ASK ABOUT ME
AT ALL?

13:11.890 --> 13:15.371
- HE--MAYBE HE, UM...

13:17.210 --> 13:19.371
I WAS REALLY THERE JUST
FOR, LIKE, A SECOND, YOU KNOW.

13:19.410 --> 13:20.752
- ALL RIGHT.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.609
- I THINK HE'S JUST TRYING
TO HELP.

13:22.660 --> 13:25.788
I'M SORRY.

13:25.830 --> 13:27.764
- I GET IT, I GUESS.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.007
THAT'S OKAY.

13:33.190 --> 13:35.909
- NORA, DO YOU WANT TO HAVE
SOME CHICKEN?

13:35.950 --> 13:37.326
- HEY, THERE.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.874
DADDY'S HOME.
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.979
- MMM.
SMELLS DELICIOUS.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.601
- THANK YOU.
- WHAT IS IT?

13:43.650 --> 13:44.878
- GWYNETH PALTROW'S
ROASTED CHICKEN.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.911
- WHAT IS SHE SUPPOSED
TO EAT FOR DINNER?

13:46.960 --> 13:49.053
- [sighs]
- NO?

13:49.100 --> 13:50.749
- NO.
- ALL RIGHT.

13:50.790 --> 13:51.927
- NO. HOW WAS WORK?
- WHERE--IT WAS GREAT.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.133
WHERE IS NORA?

13:54.170 --> 13:56.752
- NORA'S ON THE FLOOR, PLAYING.
- WHERE IS NORA?

13:56.800 --> 13:58.244
[grunts]

13:58.280 --> 14:01.693
- MAX IS UPSTAIRS.
HE IS SULKING.

14:01.730 --> 14:03.288
- MAX IS UPSTAIRS. WHY?
- HE'S UPSET.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.697
- WHY IS HE UPSET?
- 'CAUSE OF YOUR SISTER.

14:05.740 --> 14:07.002
- BECAUSE OF MY SISTER?
- YOUR SISTER.

14:07.050 --> 14:08.938
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- HE WENT TO HANK'S Al-TER SCHOOL

14:08.980 --> 14:10.493
TO WORK ON THE PRINTER.
- RIGHT.

14:10.530 --> 14:11.565
- AND SHE BROUGHT HIM HOME AND
JUST ABRUPTLY DROPPED HIM OFF.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.636
APPARENTLY HE WAS GETTING
IN THE WAY OR SOMETHING,

14:13.680 --> 14:16.012
AND SHE'S GOT--
- SHE'S GOT THAT HUGE PROJECT

14:16.060 --> 14:17.288
THAT'S DUE SOON.
- YEAH, I GET THAT.

14:17.330 --> 14:18.843
SHE HAS A DEADLINE.
I UNDERSTAND.

14:18.890 --> 14:20.050
BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE--

14:21.480 --> 14:22.469
- YEAH, SHE DID. SHE KICKED
HIM OFF THE PRINTER...

14:22.510 --> 14:24.091
- I KNOW HE'S KIND OF OBSESSED
WITH THAT THING.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.233
- AND IT WAS JUST THE WAY
THAT SHE BROUGHT HIM IN,

14:25.270 --> 14:27.409
LIKE, SHE WAS EXPECTING ME
TO APOLOGIZE, YOU KNOW?

14:27.450 --> 14:29.099
- RIGHT, YEAH, I GET THAT.
- I JUST GOT THAT FEELING.

14:29.140 --> 14:30.209
RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.446
- I JUST FELT LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:31.490 --> 14:32.752
SHE DOESN'T GET IT."

14:32.800 --> 14:35.143
SHE DOESN'T GET IT, SO I'M GONNA
LET HIM EAT IN HIS ROOM TONIGHT,

14:35.180 --> 14:37.216
'CAUSE HE'S REALLY PISSED,
AND I AM TOO.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.410
- ALL RIGHT.
I GET IT.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.145
- SO I THINK THAT MAYBE
WE SHOULD HAVE A TALK WITH HER

14:41.190 --> 14:43.351
AI-TER WE CALM HIM DOWN.
I DON'T KNOW.

14:43.390 --> 14:45.039
- WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST
LET HER TURN THE PROJECT IN,

14:45.090 --> 14:46.079
AND SHE'LL PROBABLY
FEEL EMBARRASSED

14:46.120 --> 14:48.042
ABOUT HOW SHE TREATED MAX
ONCE IT'S ALL OVER.

14:48.090 --> 14:48.943
- SHE SHOULD.
IT WAS WRONG.

14:48.990 --> 14:50.878
- I'M SURE SHE'LL CALL
AND APOLOGIZE.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.148
- SHE SHOULD.
VERY SENSITIVE KID.

14:52.200 --> 14:52.848
- LET IT LIE
FOR A COUPLE DAYS, OKAY?

14:52.890 --> 14:55.051
- YEAH. MM-HMM.
- OKAY?

14:58.750 --> 15:01.332
- [chuckles]
ROUGH DAY, HUH?

15:01.380 --> 15:04.417
- YEAH.
NOT ONE OF MY BEST.

15:04.450 --> 15:06.896
THOUGHT IT'D BE CLASSIER
IF I GOT BOOZY OUT ON THE PORCH

15:06.940 --> 15:09.170
INSTEAD OF INSIDE.

15:09.210 --> 15:11.075
- LISTEN, GOOSE, I WANT--

15:11.110 --> 15:12.998
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT OUR SELLING THE HOUSE.

15:13.050 --> 15:15.382
I JUST WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND

15:15.430 --> 15:17.182
MY POINT OF VIEW,
MY FEELINGS ABOUT IT.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.108
- I'M--MOM, I-I GET IT.
I DO.

15:19.150 --> 15:20.799
- YOU DO?
- YEAH.

15:20.850 --> 15:22.806
- 'CAUSE I WAS NOT
RAILROADING YOUR DAD.

15:22.850 --> 15:25.193
NO, HE'S A VERY STUBBORN MAN.

15:25.230 --> 15:26.913
- [chuckling]
THE MOST STUBBORN.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.268
- AND, OF COURSE,
I UNDERSTAND

15:28.300 --> 15:31.121
THAT IT'S HARD FOR YOU TOO
BECAUSE YOU GREW UP HERE.

15:31.170 --> 15:34.025
IT'S YOUR HOME, AND, UM,

15:34.070 --> 15:36.061
I WAS MAYBE A LITTLE SELFISH
NOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.477
- NO, I'M--FIRST OF ALL,
I'M SORRY.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.340
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE USED
THAT WORD "SELFISH."

15:40.380 --> 15:42.826
YOU'RE NOT SELFISH.
YOU ALWAYS PUT US FIRST,

15:42.870 --> 15:44.724
AND THIS IS YOUR HOME,
YOU KNOW?

15:44.770 --> 15:46.761
I TOTALLY GET IT.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.381
I-I HAVE MY OWN HOME NOW.

15:48.430 --> 15:51.945
I MEAN, IT'S CURRENTLY INFESTED
WITH MOLD, BUT I-I DO HAVE IT.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.016
- WELL, NO, IT'S OUR HOME,

15:54.050 --> 15:55.847
AND--AND WHILE IT STILL IS,

15:55.880 --> 15:58.087
I THINK IT'S THE PLACE

15:58.120 --> 16:01.430
WHERE AIDA'S BRUNCH
SHOULD HAPPEN,

16:01.470 --> 16:03.745
AND I WANT TO THROW THE BRUNCH.

16:03.790 --> 16:05.291
_ THAT IS VERY SWEET OF YOU,

16:05.340 --> 16:07.194
AND I APPRECIATE IT,
BUT...

16:07.240 --> 16:09.333
RENEE HAS TO THROW THIS BRUNCH.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.964
IT IS A VERY BIG DEAL THAT SHE
CELEBRATE THE TICKET TO HEAVEN

16:13.000 --> 16:14.797
WITH SOME EGGS AND MUFFIN
AT HER HOUSE.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.172
FOR HER, IT'S EVERYTHING.

16:16.210 --> 16:18.622
- WELL, OKAY,
BUT I WANT TO DO SOMETHING.

16:18.660 --> 16:21.868
SO HOW ABOUT I THROW A DINNER

16:21.910 --> 16:24.424
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE BAPTISM
FOR AIDA?

16:24.460 --> 16:27.111
- MOM, IT'S A--
THAT'S A REALLY SWEET IDEA,

16:27.150 --> 16:29.323
BUT THE BABY'S
6 1/2 MONTHS OLD.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.248
SHE'S NOT EVEN GONNA KNOW--
- NO, I KNOW.

16:31.300 --> 16:34.121
IT'S REALLY NOT FOR AIDA.
IT'S FOR THE FAMILY.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.469
THESE EVENTS
ARE ALWAYS FOR THE FAMILY.

16:36.510 --> 16:38.978
AND THIS FAMILY COULD REALLY USE
A CELEBRATION RIGHT NOW,

16:39.030 --> 16:41.089
YOU KNOW?

16:41.130 --> 16:43.234
AND I WOULD REALLY
LIKE TO DO IT.

16:43.270 --> 16:46.615
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT.

16:46.660 --> 16:48.275
- OKAY.

16:48.310 --> 16:50.653
WELL, WHEN YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY...

16:50.690 --> 16:52.385
ADD A DINNER.

16:52.420 --> 16:54.001
ADD A DINNER
TO THE AIDA WEEKEND

16:54.040 --> 16:57.214
AND LET THE FESTIVITIES BEGIN.

16:57.250 --> 17:01.425
- [breathing heavily]

17:01.460 --> 17:04.918
[knock at door]
- HEY, CAN I COME IN?

17:04.950 --> 17:07.157
- YEAH, COME IN.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.670
IF YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE,
I CAN LEAVE SO YOU GUYS...

17:09.710 --> 17:10.950
- OH, COME ON.
- CAN HAVE A LITTLE MOMENT.

17:10.990 --> 17:12.434
- THAT'S--THAT'S CLEVER.

17:12.470 --> 17:13.812
DREW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE A JERK

17:13.860 --> 17:15.020
ABOUT THE ENTIRE THING,
YOU KNOW?

17:15.060 --> 17:17.779
- YEAH, I'M THE JERK NOW,
NATALIE.

17:17.820 --> 17:19.469
- OH, HEY, NATALIE.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.614
LOOK, UM, WHAT WE HAD
WAS FUN AND ALL,

17:22.660 --> 17:25.549
BUT IT'S KIND OF BUMMING OUT
DREW, AND HE'S MY ROOMMATE,

17:25.590 --> 17:28.388
SO I GOTTA PASS.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.002
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.189
- YES.
BERTO.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.939
- OKAY, UM...

17:35.980 --> 17:37.288
LOOK, YOU'RE PISSED.

17:37.330 --> 17:39.321
- YEAH.
- FINE, I GET THAT.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.874
IT'S REALLY CLEAR.
MESSAGE RECEIVED.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.605
BUT, FRANKLY, DO YOU THINK
THAT THAT'S REALLY FAIR?

17:44.640 --> 17:46.369
LIKE, YOU DID DISAPPEAR
INTO A CAVE...

17:46.410 --> 17:47.536
- OH, MY GOSH.
- WITH YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND

17:47.580 --> 17:49.161
FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH.
- SO YOU GO AND SLEEP WITH HIM?

17:49.200 --> 17:50.997
- HEY, MAN.
- WITH BERTO, NATALIE.

17:51.030 --> 17:54.204
- COME ON!
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

17:56.380 --> 17:58.063
- I KNOW.
- DREW, I FEEL LIKE

17:58.110 --> 17:59.964
WE'RE FORGETTING
HOW THIS WENT DOWN,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.651
THAT YOU FELL OFF THE FACE OF
THE EARTH FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.213
WAS I SUPPOSED TO JUST SIT
IN MY DORM FOR A MONTH

18:04.250 --> 18:07.071
AND BE CELIBATE AND WAIT FOR YOU
TO COME HANG OUT?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.144
- NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
IT'S HIM!

18:08.190 --> 18:10.943
I'LL LEAVE MY OWN DORM.
- DREW.

18:10.980 --> 18:13.084
- WELL, I FEEL LIKE THIS IS
A REALLY BIG DECISION,

18:13.120 --> 18:16.669
AND WE'RE NOT EVEN
COMMUNICATING ABOUT IT.

18:16.710 --> 18:18.052
THIS IS OUR NIECE.

18:18.090 --> 18:20.650
HOW CAN YOU
JUST BAIL OUT ON THIS?

18:20.680 --> 18:21.499
- I'M NOT BAILING, JULIA.

18:21.540 --> 18:24.122
CROSBY ASKED ME
TO STEP DOWN HERE.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.991
- YOU--HOW ARE YOU NOT
FIGHTING FOR IT?

18:27.030 --> 18:29.749
JOEL, HOW ARE YOU
NOT FIGHTING FOR ME,

18:29.790 --> 18:31.200
FOR ALL OF THIS?

18:31.240 --> 18:33.959
I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST--
- JULIA.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.207
- WHEN CROSBY AND JASMINE
CAME OVER HERE

18:36.250 --> 18:38.275
AND THEY ASKED US TO BE
HER GODPARENTS,

18:38.320 --> 18:40.379
THAT MEANT SO MUCH TO ME.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.069
I WAS SO PROUD OF THAT,
YOU KNOW?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.667
IT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL.

18:43.700 --> 18:47.045
IT'S A HUGE HONOR,
AND IT'S A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY,

18:47.090 --> 18:48.159
AND I DON'T KNOW--
MAYBE YOU THINK

18:48.190 --> 18:50.226
THAT IT'S JUST SOME SYMBOLIC
THING OR SOMETHING,

18:50.260 --> 18:52.888
AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT
EVEN RELIGIOUS,

18:52.920 --> 18:55.536
BUT THIS IS A LOSS FOR ME.

18:57.890 --> 19:01.132
- JULIA, YOU'RE STILL GOING
TO BE HER GODPARENT.

19:01.170 --> 19:05.061
- I WANTED TO DO IT WITH YOU,
MY HUSBAND.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.749
I JUST--I DON'T UNDERSTAND

19:06.800 --> 19:10.201
WHY YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO FIGHT FOR THIS, FOR US.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.496
THE JOEL I KNOW
WOULD HAVE SAID TO CROSBY,

19:16.530 --> 19:19.215
"THIS IS MY GODDAUGHTER,
AND I'M NOT BAILING OUT."

19:25.990 --> 19:28.436
ARE YOU THERE?

19:28.470 --> 19:30.028
JOEL?

19:30.060 --> 19:32.676
- YEAH, I'M HERE.

19:34.820 --> 19:38.130
AND, NO, I'M NOT WILLING TO STOP
FIGHTING FOR OUR CHILDREN

19:38.170 --> 19:42.209
AND FOR OUR MARRIAGE,
BUT THIS...

19:42.250 --> 19:45.037
THIS WASN'T MY CALL.
THIS WASN'T MY FIGHT.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.969
SO PLEASE DON'T DIG IN
ON THIS, PLEASE.

19:48.010 --> 19:49.238
IT'S OVER NOW.

19:49.290 --> 19:50.211
- WELL...

19:53.360 --> 19:55.828
WHENEVER YOU'RE...

19:55.880 --> 20:00.396
YOU'RE READY TO FIGHT FOR US,
I'M HERE.

20:14.830 --> 20:18.061
- YEAH, NO.
UM, IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME.

20:18.110 --> 20:20.271
IT WAS OKAY.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.208
UH, YEAH.
YEAH, SHE IS.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.797
SHE'S HERE.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.900
WELL, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

20:26.940 --> 20:28.146
- HUH.

20:28.190 --> 20:29.839
WHO WAS THAT?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.359
- THAT WAS KRISTINA.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.676
- KRISTINA! YOU'RE KIDDING?
WHAT DID SHE WANT?

20:34.710 --> 20:37.429
- JUST--YOU KNOW,
SEEING IF YOU'RE HERE.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.778
- SEEING IF I'M HERE.

20:38.820 --> 20:43.405
WHY? BECAUSE IF I'M HERE,
THEN MAX IS NOT COMING BY?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.021
- PRETTY MUCH.
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

20:45.070 --> 20:46.753
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

20:46.790 --> 20:48.348
- I MEAN...

20:48.380 --> 20:50.348
YOU WERE A LITTLE HARSH
WITH THE KID, RIGHT?

20:50.380 --> 20:52.439
- HOW WAS I HARSH?
I WAS NOT HARSH.

20:52.490 --> 20:55.072
HE--HE WAS OFF THE RAILS.

20:55.110 --> 20:57.761
THIS IS OUR PLACE
OF, YOU KNOW, WORK.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.974
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, MAX...
HE'S A KID STILL, RIGHT?

21:01.010 --> 21:03.217
- HE'S NOT A KID.
THIS IS--HE'S 14 YEARS OLD.

21:03.260 --> 21:05.592
NO ONE'S DOING HIM ANY FAVORS

21:05.640 --> 21:08.108
TO--TO KEEP TREATING HIM
LIKE A BABY.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.741
- YEAH.

21:09.780 --> 21:11.122
- THIS IS MY PLACE OF WORK.
I FINALLY HAVE ONE,

21:11.160 --> 21:14.197
AND I'M DOING WELL HERE,

21:14.230 --> 21:16.983
AND I-I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME
TO HAVE A PLACE OF BUSINESS,

21:17.030 --> 21:21.273
AND I THINK MY FAMILY
SHOULD RESPECT THAT, DON'T YOU?

21:21.310 --> 21:22.754
- YEAH.

21:22.790 --> 21:23.609
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE
TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU.

21:23.660 --> 21:25.275
- I SEE YOUR POINT--
YOU DON'T GOT

21:25.310 --> 21:25.969
TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.
- THANK YOU!

21:26.000 --> 21:28.389
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.864
- LOOKING AT YOU.
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

21:29.900 --> 21:32.141
YOU GOT TO RELAX.
- YOU LOOK AT ME ALL SUSPICIOUS.

21:32.180 --> 21:34.239
- TAKE IT EASY.
- UGH.

21:34.290 --> 21:36.281
UNBELIEVABLE.
THIS FAMILY.

21:36.320 --> 21:39.392
- WHAT? CHECKING
IF YOU'RE STILL HERE?

21:39.430 --> 21:42.228
- NO, AIDA'S BAPTISM
NOW HAS A DINNER ADDED.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.148
SO NOW THERE'S A DINNER

21:44.190 --> 21:47.193
AND THEN THE BAPTISM
AND A BRUNCH.

21:47.230 --> 21:48.640
OH, GOD.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.227
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?
YOU NEED A BEER.

21:50.270 --> 21:52.238
- I DO. I'M SO SORRY
THAT THIS WHOLE THING

21:52.270 --> 21:54.830
HAS SNOWBALLED
INTO ALL THESE EVENTS...

21:54.860 --> 21:56.304
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- ALL OF A SUDDEN.

21:56.340 --> 21:57.614
IT'S A REAL PAIN, I KNOW.

21:57.660 --> 21:58.342
- YOU'RE THE SERVANT
OF TWO MOTHERS.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.587
- RIGHT.
- THAT'S WHAT THESE

22:00.620 --> 22:02.793
RITES OF PASSAGE ARE ABOUT,
ANYWAY, MAKING THE MOMS HAPPY.

22:02.830 --> 22:05.276
- AND LOOK, I HATE TO ASK
SO LAST MINUTE, BUT--

22:05.320 --> 22:07.242
- ANYTHING YOU NEED.
WHAT IS IT?

22:07.290 --> 22:10.999
- I NEED A GODFATHER.

22:11.050 --> 22:14.634
IF IT'S TOO BIG OF A PAIN IN THE
BUTT, I--YOU KNOW, I REALIZE--

22:14.670 --> 22:18.049
- NO, CROS, I-I JUST--
I'M, UH...

22:18.090 --> 22:19.910
I'M PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.

22:19.950 --> 22:23.818
I WOULD LOVE TO BE
AIDA'S GODFATHER.

22:23.850 --> 22:26.262
- GREAT. I DIDN'T KNOW
IF IT WAS GONNA BE WEIRD,

22:26.310 --> 22:28.687
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT A TRADITIONAL
BELIEVER OR WHATEVER.

22:28.720 --> 22:29.994
- I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

22:30.030 --> 22:31.827
BUT I BELIEVE IN LOVE
AND DOING THE RIGHT THING.

22:31.860 --> 22:33.168
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH
TO BE A GODFATHER.

22:33.210 --> 22:34.996
COME HERE.
COME HERE, MAN.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.201
I'M MOVED, MAN, YOU KNOW.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.137
- ALL RIGHT.
- GOOD.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.526
I REALLY AM.
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME

22:41.560 --> 22:42.902
THAT YOU'D PICK ME,
YOU KNOW?

22:42.940 --> 22:43.838
I MEAN, YOU COULD HAVE PICKED
ANYBODY IN THE WORLD.

22:43.870 --> 22:46.259
YOU PICKED ME
TO BE AIDA'S GODFATHER.

22:46.290 --> 22:47.018
THAT IS AWESOME.

22:47.050 --> 22:48.802
- YOU'RE--WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME.

22:48.850 --> 22:51.489
- WHO'S GOING TO BE
THE GODMOTHER?

22:51.540 --> 22:54.532
- I WILL PROBABLY ASK JULIA.
- JULIA, THAT'S GREAT.

22:54.580 --> 22:55.740
ESPECIALLY WITH EVERYTHING

22:55.780 --> 22:57.293
THAT'S GOING ON IN HER LIFE
RIGHT NOW,

22:57.340 --> 22:58.500
THAT'S GONNA MAKE HER
FEEL REALLY GREAT.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.019
KRISTINA.
- YES, HONEY.

23:00.060 --> 23:02.028
- GUESS WHO'S GONNA BE
AIDA'S GODFATHER.

23:02.070 --> 23:03.549
- WHAT?
HI, CROSBY.

23:03.580 --> 23:05.024
- I'M GONNA BE
AIDA'S GODFATHER, THAT'S WHO.

23:05.070 --> 23:07.755
CROSBY PICKED ME
TO BE AIDA'S GODFATHER.

23:07.800 --> 23:08.926
- THAT'S AMAZING!
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

23:08.970 --> 23:10.130
- WOW. THAT'S REALLY COOL.
- YEAH, SO...

23:10.180 --> 23:12.239
- THAT'S AWESOME.
COME HERE!

23:12.280 --> 23:13.929
ONE MORE. COME ON.
HEY!

23:13.970 --> 23:14.902
- LET'S DO IT.

23:14.940 --> 23:17.101
- IT'S DISGUSTING.
HE WEARS MY SOCKS,

23:17.150 --> 23:19.004
BUT HE FLIPS THEM INSIDE OUT

23:19.050 --> 23:21.735
AND SAYS THAT IT'S CLEAN NOW
OR SOMETHING.

23:21.770 --> 23:23.806
IT'S LIKE--
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

23:23.850 --> 23:25.158
- WELL, IT MAKES YOU THINK.

23:25.190 --> 23:27.909
IS HE GOING TO CALL ME

23:27.950 --> 23:30.703
OR WRITE ME OR TEXT ME
EVER AGAIN, YOU KNOW?

23:30.750 --> 23:33.127
- THE GATORADE THING DID BOTHER
ME, NOW THAT YOU SAY THAT.

23:33.170 --> 23:36.754
IT'S LIKE I'M THIRSTY.
I BOUGHT IT, YOU KNOW?

23:36.790 --> 23:38.519
I WANT TO COME HOME
AND HAVE MY DRINK.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.586
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
WHAT ARE THE RULES?

23:40.620 --> 23:42.133
IS THERE A PROTOCOL
TO THIS WHOLE THING, YOU KNOW?

23:42.170 --> 23:45.628
I MEAN, I'M NOT THE ONE THAT
SHOULD BE REACHING OUT, RIGHT?

23:45.660 --> 23:47.764
- GOD. I'M NOT
REACHING OUT TO HER, NO.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.108
AI-TER SHE SLEEPS WITH HIM?

23:49.150 --> 23:51.937
LIKE, OF ALL PEOPLE, NATALIE.

23:51.980 --> 23:53.936
- I MEAN, OF ALL THE THINGS
THAT YOU COULD DO,

23:53.980 --> 23:56.972
YOU'RE GONNA JUST GO BACK
TO THE MILITARY, REALLY?

23:58.160 --> 24:00.116
- YEAH.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.297
YEAH.

24:01.330 --> 24:02.706
- I'M SORRY.

24:02.750 --> 24:04.502
I WAS LISTENING
ABOUT YOUR CONVERSATION TOO.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.019
- YEAH, I KNOW.

24:06.060 --> 24:08.813
- I MEAN, AT LEAST WE'RE SORT OF
GOING THROUGH THIS TOGETHER

24:08.860 --> 24:10.816
IN A WEIRD
PARALLEL-UNIVERSE WAY.

24:10.860 --> 24:13.021
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
OH, GOD.

24:13.070 --> 24:17.166
- WHAT'S GONNA MAKE IT BETTER,
LIKE, NOTHING BUT TIME PASSING?

24:17.210 --> 24:20.418
- WE JUST ABIDE
BY THIS CONCEPT CALLED TIME.

24:20.450 --> 24:22.270
- DON'T, PLEASE.
- THAT WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.720
- [laughs]
- IT MAKES NO SENSE.

24:24.770 --> 24:27.079
IT'S JUST--IT'S LIKE ANOTHER
REALM OF UNDERSTANDING.

24:29.640 --> 24:33.110
- SPEAKING OF OTHER REALMS
OF UNDERSTANDING...

24:33.160 --> 24:35.742
I THINK I HAVE
A COUPLE THINGS IN HERE

24:35.780 --> 24:39.671
TO MAYBE MAKE THE TIME PASS
A LITTLE MORE QUICKLY, HUH?

24:39.710 --> 24:42.053
- SURE, SURE.
- AND ICE CREAM

24:42.100 --> 24:43.783
TASTE A LITTLE BETTER.

24:43.820 --> 24:44.809
- WEED IN THE FREEZER?

24:44.860 --> 24:48.261
- IT KEEPS IT FRESH. DUH!
- IT KEEPS IT FRESH?

24:48.310 --> 24:50.346
- YES.

WE'RE NOT SELLING THE HOUSE,

32:19.730 --> 32:21.448
WE'RE JUST--ACTUALLY,
WE'RE JUST DISCUSSING IT.

32:21.490 --> 32:24.243
IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
- SINCE WHEN?

32:24.280 --> 32:25.929
- WELL, SINCE--WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE.

32:25.970 --> 32:28.530
- CALM DOWN.
- WELL, I DIDN'T--

32:28.560 --> 32:31.074
THEY'RE SELLING MY CHILDHOOD
HOME, AND NOBODY TOLD ME?

32:31.120 --> 32:32.667
DID EVERYBODY ELSE--
- I HAD A SIMILAR REACTION.

32:32.700 --> 32:34.258
- DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

32:34.290 --> 32:34.904
- WELL, WE'RE LIVING HERE,
SO, YEAH.

32:34.950 --> 32:37.498
- DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

32:37.540 --> 32:40.122
- THAT, I HEARD ABOUT
A FEW MONTHS AGO FROM DAD,

32:40.160 --> 32:42.742
BUT I'M SURPRISED TO FIND OUT
IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

32:42.780 --> 32:45.852
WHAT I DID NOT KNOW IS THAT
I WAS RUNNER-UP FOR GODFATHER.

32:45.890 --> 32:47.027
- OH, WOW.

32:47.060 --> 32:49.779
- ADAM.
- THAT'S COLD-BLOODED.

32:49.820 --> 32:53.039
[overlapping chatter]
- HE'S SO MAD!

32:53.070 --> 32:55.106
- I MEANT TO TELL YOU,
BUT YOU GOT EMOTIONAL,

32:55.140 --> 32:57.517
AND THEN I WAS--IT FELT LIKE
WE WERE CONNECTING,

32:57.560 --> 32:59.516
AND H SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.
- CROS--

32:59.560 --> 33:01.004
- I'M JUST HAPPY
THAT I'M SECOND PLACE,

33:01.040 --> 33:03.622
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO

33:03.670 --> 33:04.978
WHEN IT COMES TO PARENTING.
- WHO SAID THAT?

33:05.010 --> 33:07.490
- SAYS WHO?
- WELL, SARAH.

33:07.530 --> 33:09.111
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY NO TO MAX.

33:09.150 --> 33:10.970
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY NO TO MAX.

33:11.020 --> 33:14.057
- OH. OH, OKAY.
- IT WASN'T LIKE THAT, KRISTINA.

33:14.090 --> 33:15.432
NO, NO, NO.
IT WAS NOT LIKE THAT.

33:15.470 --> 33:17.199
- SO I'M JUST HAPPY
TO BE A GODPARENT.

33:17.230 --> 33:20.165
- HER KIDS ARE STONED.
YOU SEE HOW STONED THEY ARE?

33:20.200 --> 33:21.997
- WHAT?
- THEY'RE STONED.

33:22.030 --> 33:23.679
CHEECH AND CHONG--
OH, YEAH, THEY'RE BAKED.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.062
- MAYBE THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE NOT A GODPARENT,

33:25.100 --> 33:26.328
'CAUSE YOUR KIDS ARE STONERS.

33:26.380 --> 33:27.540
- SUPER BAKED.
- WHAT?

33:27.590 --> 33:28.545
- YO!
- NO?

33:28.590 --> 33:30.034
- THEY LOOK OKAY TO ME.

33:30.070 --> 33:32.311
- SARAH, FOR THE RECORD,
WE DID CONSIDER YOU.

33:32.350 --> 33:35.478
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
WE HAD ASKED JOEL AND JULIA

33:35.530 --> 33:37.725
'CAUSE THEY WERE,
YOU KNOW, AN ITEM.

33:37.770 --> 33:39.738
THEY WERE A MARRIED COUPLE.

33:39.770 --> 33:40.930
- YOU MEAN I WAS CONSIDERED
SECOND, THIRD, OR LAST.

33:40.980 --> 33:44.848
- NO, YOU DON'T HAVE A HUSBAND,
SO WE HAD TO ASK A TEAM.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.871
- SO, BECAUSE I'M NOT MARRIED,

33:46.920 --> 33:49.673
I CAN'T BE A SPIRITUAL GUIDE

33:49.710 --> 33:51.052
FOR THE--FOR A CHILD?

33:51.090 --> 33:54.127
- YOU'RE NOT ELECTING
A SPIRITUAL GUIDE.

33:54.170 --> 33:55.819
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS,
THEY'RE GONNA RAISE--

33:55.860 --> 33:56.997
THEY HAVE THE CUSTODY.
- YOU DON'T NEED A MAN FOR IT.

33:57.030 --> 33:59.544
- RIGHT? AM I RIGHT?

33:59.580 --> 34:00.956
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
SERVICE FOR--

34:01.000 --> 34:02.399
- NOTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED...

34:02.450 --> 34:03.826
- GOOD TIMES
AT THE BRAVERMANS.

34:03.860 --> 34:05.862
- IF THIS EVENT WASN'T FORCED
DOWN EVERYONE'S THROAT.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.481
I'VE BEEN GOING
FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE

34:07.520 --> 34:10.102
DISAPPOINTING MY FAMILY MEMBERS
ALL SO WE CAN HAVE THIS THING

34:10.150 --> 34:11.936
THAT DOESN'T EVEN NEED
TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.

34:11.980 --> 34:13.459
- TAKE IT DOWN, CROSBY.

34:13.490 --> 34:14.309
- WELL, IT'S HAPPENING,
CROSBY,

34:14.360 --> 34:16.078
BECAUSE I ASKED YOU
TO BAPTIZE AIDA,

34:16.120 --> 34:18.634
AND JUST BECAUSE THERE'S
A LOT OF DRAMA GOING ON

34:18.670 --> 34:20.877
DOESN'T MEAN THAT BABY AIDA
SHOULD SUFFER.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.228
- SHE'S NOT SUFFERING.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.125
SHE'S UPSTAIRS
SLEEPING PEACEFULLY.

34:24.160 --> 34:25.388
SHE'S NOT IN JEOPARDY.
- CALM DOWN, CROSBY.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.577
- I DON'T BELIEVE IN A GOD

34:26.610 --> 34:28.225
THAT WOULD SEND A LITTLE BABY
TO HELL.

34:28.270 --> 34:30.295
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DO.
- I'M SORRY THAT I COULDN'T

34:30.340 --> 34:31.921
HOLD THE MARRIAGE TOGETHER
LONG ENOUGH

34:31.960 --> 34:33.063
TO MAKE THIS SIMPLE
FOR YOU GUYS.

34:33.100 --> 34:35.375
all: NO!

34:35.410 --> 34:37.685
- IT'S FINE.
IT'S FINE.

34:37.730 --> 34:40.449
I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA CHECK UP
ON THE KIDS.

34:43.770 --> 34:44.839
- AH, EXCUSE ME.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.674
- HI.
- OKAY.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.613
CAN I GET YOU A BEER,
OR YOU JUST WANT TO--

35:11.660 --> 35:13.059
- NO.
NO, THANKS.

35:13.110 --> 35:15.374
I'M NOT GONNA BE THAT LONG.
- I FIGURED.

35:15.420 --> 35:18.173
- SO...

35:18.210 --> 35:20.792
THIS IS IT, HUH?

35:20.840 --> 35:23.115
- THIS IS IT.
YEP. YEP.

35:23.150 --> 35:25.357
- WELL, LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

35:27.570 --> 35:29.117
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

35:29.160 --> 35:32.049
- [scoffs]

35:32.090 --> 35:34.399
WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING?
WELL...

35:34.440 --> 35:39.230
I'M, UH, TRYING TO FIGURE
THINGS OUT, YOU KNOW.

35:39.270 --> 35:41.192
FIGURING THINGS OUT.

35:41.240 --> 35:45.199
- YEAH.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.208
WELL...

35:49.180 --> 35:51.102
- [sighs]
- LET ME ASK YOU A FAVOR, THEN.

35:51.140 --> 35:53.791
- OKAY.
- UH, COULD YOU TRY HARDER?

35:56.530 --> 35:58.145
HEY, LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS
ARE GOING THROUGH SOME STUFF.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.329
- YEAH.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.258
- AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE PISSED
AT JULIA.

36:01.290 --> 36:03.155
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

36:03.190 --> 36:05.078
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.839
- IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT.

36:07.880 --> 36:09.222
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

36:09.270 --> 36:11.295
- YOU GUYS HAVE HAD IT
PRETTY GOOD,

36:11.340 --> 36:12.739
AND NOW YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH,

36:12.790 --> 36:15.099
AND YOU'RE GONNA GIVE UP, MAN?
COME ON.

36:15.130 --> 36:19.203
LOOK, WHEN...

36:19.240 --> 36:23.586
I WALKED JULIA DOWN THE AISLE,
I GAVE HER TO YOU,

36:23.620 --> 36:28.034
AND I WAS SO PROUD,
AND I WAS SO SURE,

36:28.080 --> 36:30.139
AND STILL AM,

36:30.180 --> 36:33.149
OF THE MAN
THAT I GAVE HER TO.

36:33.190 --> 36:35.704
I KNOW WHAT KIND
OF A GUY HE IS.

36:38.120 --> 36:43.080
I MADE A VOW TO SUPPORT YOU
AND HER IN THAT MARRIAGE.

36:43.130 --> 36:45.189
I TOOK YOU ON AS A SON.

36:48.270 --> 36:50.409
[sighs]

36:50.440 --> 36:54.274
WELL, YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE CELEBRATION, RIGHT?

36:54.310 --> 36:56.107
- MM-HMM.

36:56.140 --> 36:58.825
- I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D BE THERE.

37:03.110 --> 37:05.078
- I LIKE THAT.
PRINT THAT ONE.

37:05.110 --> 37:07.499
- YEAH.
- DON'T CHANGE IT.

37:07.530 --> 37:08.212
- I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING.
- DON'T MESS WITH IT.

37:08.260 --> 37:09.704
- I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING.

37:09.740 --> 37:11.321
- I'LL BE BACK
IN AN HOUR OR TWO.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.158
- YEAH.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY TO MAX?

37:14.190 --> 37:15.873
- [groans] I'M NOT GONNA SAY
ANYTHING TO MAX.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.366
I DON'T OWE MY 14-YEAR-OLD
NEPHEW AN APOLOGY.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.051
- I'LL PROBABLY APOLOGIZE
TO HIM ANYWAY.

37:21.100 --> 37:25.548
- BUT IN THEIR DEFENSE, UM...
- WHO?

37:25.580 --> 37:26.990
- WELL, LOOK,
I'M NOT DEFENDING THEM,

37:27.030 --> 37:29.305
BUT I WAS THINKING

37:29.350 --> 37:32.478
ABOUT, UH, HOW YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE JOB THE OTHER DAY...

37:32.520 --> 37:34.795
- MM-HMM.
- HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO YOU,

37:34.830 --> 37:36.969
HOW YOU FOUND SOMETHING
YOU'RE GOOD AT

37:37.010 --> 37:40.104
AND YOU GOT A FUTURE WITH.

37:40.150 --> 37:42.380
THAT'S PROBABLY HOW ADAM
AND KRISTINA FEEL

37:42.430 --> 37:45.661
ABOUT MAX
FINDING PHOTOGRAPHY...

37:45.710 --> 37:47.598
- YEAH.
- 'CAUSE, UH...

37:47.640 --> 37:51.326
WHEN YOU FIND,
UH, YOUR THING...

37:52.960 --> 37:55.292
IT'S LIKE A LIFE RAl-T...

37:55.340 --> 37:57.956
KIND OF...

37:57.990 --> 37:59.309
IN THE STORM, YOU KNOW?

37:59.340 --> 38:00.329
IT'S LIKE THE STORMY
SEA OF LIFE, AND...

38:04.240 --> 38:09.177
ANYWAY, I'M WORKING ON TRYING
TO SEE HOW PEOPLE FEEL,

38:09.210 --> 38:12.031
TRYING TO THINK ABOUT--MORE
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE FEELING

38:12.080 --> 38:15.004
AND ALL THAT STUFF, SO THAT
THOUGHT POPPED IN MY HEAD

38:15.050 --> 38:16.733
ABOUT MAX.

38:16.770 --> 38:19.830
- YEAH.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.086
- YEAH.
- REALLY?

38:21.120 --> 38:24.806
THAT JUST POPPED IN YOUR HEAD
ABOUT THE STORMY SEA?

38:24.850 --> 38:27.080
- YEAH.

38:27.130 --> 38:30.918
YEAH, IT JUST POPPED IN MY HEAD,
AND I'M GONNA JUST SAY IT.

38:30.960 --> 38:31.927
- I'M GLAD YOU DID.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.848
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

38:33.890 --> 38:36.233
- [chuckles]
- IT'S A STORMY SEA OF LIFE.

38:36.270 --> 38:39.649
IT'S VERY POETIC.

38:39.690 --> 38:40.861
- HURRY UP.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.583
WE CANNOT BE LATE
AI-TER YESTERDAY, SERIOUSLY.

38:42.630 --> 38:43.483
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M CHECKING.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.579
- THIS IS LIKE
THE WORST THING EVER.

38:45.630 --> 38:47.029
- THIS SMELLS LIKE A BEER.
I CAN'T--NO.

38:47.080 --> 38:49.423
- I'M SURE IT'S FINE.
- NO, IT SMELLS LIKE BEER.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.109
- UGH! WHAT IS THIS?
- YEAH, IT'S BAD.

38:51.150 --> 38:51.900
I'M TELLING YOU,
I DON'T KNOW.

38:51.950 --> 38:53.451
I CAN'T WEAR THIS
IN FRONT OF MOM.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.354
- DO YOU HAVE TIC'J'YTHING ELSE?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.425
I CAN--WE CAN STOP
AND BY SOMETHING--

38:57.470 --> 39:01.054
- NO, I--
- THAT--THAT'S FINE.

39:01.090 --> 39:03.229
- I HAVE--
- YES, I'LL TAKE IT.

39:03.270 --> 39:05.784
- IT'S RYAN'S.
- OH, NO.

39:05.820 --> 39:08.789
- IT'S, LIKE, THE ONE THING
THAT HE LEI-T HERE, AND I--

39:08.820 --> 39:10.856
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE, LIKE,
SENT IT BACK OR WHATEVER,

39:10.900 --> 39:13.300
BUT I JUST--
- YEAH, THAT SUCKS.

39:13.350 --> 39:16.797
- AND I'M GLAD
IT'S GONNA GO TO GOOD USE.

39:16.830 --> 39:20.903
- YEAH.
ALSO, IF YOU'RE SAD, OBVIOUSLY,

39:20.940 --> 39:22.976
YOU KNOW, I CAN STAY HERE

39:23.010 --> 39:26.047
IF YOU NEED ME TO HELP YOU
GET THROUGH THIS TIME.

39:26.080 --> 39:26.944
- LIKE A CHARITY THING?

39:26.980 --> 39:30.108
[both laugh]
- AS A SIBLING, YOU KNOW,

39:30.160 --> 39:31.229
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

39:31.260 --> 39:33.433
- AH, I MEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE KIND OF SAD.

39:33.470 --> 39:36.439
MAYBE YOU SHOULD STAY HERE
SO THAT I CAN HELP YOU...

39:36.470 --> 39:38.290
- THANK YOU FOR ACKNOWLEDGING
THE UP SIDE TOO.

39:38.340 --> 39:40.501
- THROUGH THE SWEATPANTS PHASE
THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

39:40.550 --> 39:42.233
- IT SOUNDS GOOD.
MUTUAL BENEFIT.

39:42.270 --> 39:44.306
- OKAY, AND YOU'RE STILL GONNA
GO TO SCHOOL AND STUFF, RIGHT?

39:44.340 --> 39:45.955
- YEAH.
YEAH.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.342
- OKAY, IT SOUNDS GOOD.
- ALL RIGHT.

39:47.380 --> 39:49.302
- HURRY UP, PLEASE.
- I KNOW. YEAH.

39:49.350 --> 39:50.829
- WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.340
- I HAVEN'T BEEN TO CHURCH
IN A WHILE.

39:54.390 --> 39:56.449
- YEAH, RIGHT?
- I KNOW.

39:56.490 --> 39:57.240
- IT'LL PROBABLY BE GOOD FOR US.
- HEY, GUYS.

39:57.290 --> 39:59.429
- HEY.
- HI.

39:59.460 --> 40:00.495
HEY.
- HI.

40:00.530 --> 40:01.804
YOU LOOK PRETTY.
- HI, SO DO YOU.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.489
- HEY, SO I RENTED THAT PRINTER

40:03.530 --> 40:05.532
THAT MAX REALLY LIKES
FOR ANOTHER WEEK,

40:05.570 --> 40:07.538
'CAUSE I THOUGHT
HE COULD COME BY NEXT WEEK.

40:07.570 --> 40:09.151
- OH.
- REALLY?

40:09.190 --> 40:10.464
- YEAH, I FIGURED--
- THANK YOU.

40:10.510 --> 40:11.647
- THAT'S GREAT.
HE'LL BE STOKED.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.227
HEY, MAX!
MAX! YOUR AUNT SARAH

40:13.270 --> 40:16.364
RENTED THAT PRINTER YOU LOVE
SO MUCH FOR AN EXTRA WEEK.

40:16.410 --> 40:18.446
- WHOO!
- I CAN'T USE IT NEXT WEEK.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.994
I'M BOOKED TOO SOLID.

40:21.030 --> 40:22.611
[both laughing]

40:22.660 --> 40:23.729
- WELL...
- GREAT.

40:23.760 --> 40:24.579
- OUCH.
- BAG OF POOP FOR YOU.

40:24.620 --> 40:25.484
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.136
- PUT IN YOUR PIGGIES.

40:28.180 --> 40:30.068
PUT YOUR PIGGIES IN.
- LOOK AT THIS PRETTY GIRL.

40:30.110 --> 40:31.418
[Crosby snorting]

40:31.460 --> 40:34.839
- [giggIeSJ

40:34.880 --> 40:36.768
- DID YOU MEAN IT
WHEN YOU SAID TO YOUR MOM

40:36.810 --> 40:38.664
THAT JABBAR'S BAPTISM WAS ONE
OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS

40:38.710 --> 40:40.359
OF YOUR LIFE?
- I DID.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.708
- YOU DID?
- YEAH.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.776
- BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN ALL THIS.

40:43.820 --> 40:46.015
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO, YOU KNOW?

40:46.060 --> 40:47.709
ANY REASON FOR THE FAMILY
TO COME TOGETHER

40:47.750 --> 40:52.403
IS A GOOD REASON,
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.758
- IS THAT TRUE?

40:53.790 --> 40:56.065
ARE YOU EXCITED TO GET TOGETHER
WITH YOUR FAMILY?

40:56.100 --> 40:57.135
- SHE IS.

40:57.170 --> 41:00.173
- YOU SEE, IT'S MY THING

41:02.320 --> 41:05.483
TO BE PART OF SOMEONE

41:08.560 --> 41:11.734
AS A TRUE FRIEND

41:14.710 --> 41:17.873
IT'S PART OF ME

41:21.720 --> 41:24.883
YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S
SO MUCH

41:27.510 --> 41:30.991
LITTLE GIRL, WE'VE GOT TO
TELL EACH OTHER

41:31.040 --> 41:34.305
MM-HMM

41:34.350 --> 41:37.513
ABOUT THE WHOLE WORLD

41:40.420 --> 41:42.695
AND MOST ESPECIALLY
ONE ANOTHER

41:42.740 --> 41:45.379
OH, YEAH,
ALL RIGHT

41:45.430 --> 41:47.182
AND YOU KNOW,
AND YOU KNOW

41:47.220 --> 41:51.259
- AND IT'S HARD

41:51.300 --> 41:53.632
YES, IT IS

41:53.680 --> 41:56.057
IT'S HARD

41:56.090 --> 41:59.503
YES, IT IS

41:59.550 --> 42:01.438
AND I WONDER

42:01.480 --> 42:03.539
- [silently]
THANK YOU.

42:03.590 --> 42:04.614
- AND I WONDER

42:04.660 --> 42:09.279
COULD IT BE
A DREAM, YES
