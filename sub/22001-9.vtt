WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.716
Only on Fox.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.392
POODLE:
Thank you all for coming.

00:24.425 --> 00:27.161
Your father and I
have some big news

00:27.195 --> 00:28.996
that we thought
you should hear in person.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.998
Right, yeah.
Can we just take a second

00:31.031 --> 00:32.366
and discuss Christopher's teeth?

00:32.400 --> 00:33.601
Oh, you noticed those.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.436
Courtesy of the great state
of Connecticut.

00:35.469 --> 00:36.904
They're really nice, Dad.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.372
Uh-huh.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.873
-Let's get back on track.
-Yes.

00:39.907 --> 00:42.943
Um, Christopher,
would you like to start?

00:42.976 --> 00:44.778
No, you go ahead.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.514
I really think
you should tell them.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.182
Wait, are you guys having
another baby?

00:48.216 --> 00:50.351
Oh. Ew. No. No, just...

00:50.384 --> 00:51.752
We're getting a divorce.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.454
-What?!
-Okay. -Why?

00:53.487 --> 00:55.956
Ugh. Well, I mean, not that
you'd ever understand this,

00:55.989 --> 00:57.225
but marriage is very difficult.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.792
No, I mean why now?

00:58.826 --> 01:01.195
You live in separate prisons.
Seems like a lot of paperwork.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.531
Mm, but we're a family. You're
just gonna throw this all away?

01:03.564 --> 01:06.434
Well, I'm afraid
there's more news.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.402
Is it bad?
I can't handle more bad.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.437
It's about you, Chip.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.439
Oh, God. I don't feel so good.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.740
Poodle, floor is yours.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.542
Really? I have to give
both pieces of news?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.910
Well, considering
the circumstances,

01:16.944 --> 01:18.212
I think you should
take this one.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.813
Just frickin' lay it on me!

01:19.847 --> 01:21.382
(sighs) Fine.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.751
Chip, um, we just thought

01:23.784 --> 01:27.588
that you should know
that your father...

01:27.621 --> 01:29.557
is not your father.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.493
What? Who's his real dad?

01:32.526 --> 01:35.229
Some scumbag dick
named Howard Buckley.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.597
All right, look, the point is

01:36.630 --> 01:37.765
this doesn't change anything,
sweetie.

01:37.798 --> 01:38.832
SABRINA:
Are you serious?

01:38.866 --> 01:40.301
-Kind of changes everything.
-Okay.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.903
Can we all just show a little
sensitivity here, please?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.738
Poor kid just found out
he's a bastard.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.140
How you doing, Chip? You okay?

01:46.174 --> 01:47.575
Ch-Chip?

01:47.608 --> 01:50.411
Hello?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.313
(all gasp)

01:52.346 --> 01:55.149
Are you happy?

01:55.183 --> 01:57.818
-Damn. That is heavy.
-Mm-hmm. -Yeah, poor kid.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.254
It was more bad news than his
little tiny brain could handle.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.555
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.098
Hey, pal. How you holding up?

02:11.131 --> 02:14.435
Just filling my bastard glass
with some bastard juice.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.937
You know, maybe you should reach
out to this Howard Buckley guy.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.640
No way. I'm not talking
to that home-wrecker.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.475
Chip, when I was a little girl,

02:21.509 --> 02:23.477
I told my father
that I hated him

02:23.511 --> 02:25.313
because he would not
buy me a mango pop.

02:25.346 --> 02:29.283
And the next day,
he was murdered. By a bus.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.618
CHIP:
Alba, what does this story

02:30.651 --> 02:32.186
have to do with me in any way?

02:32.220 --> 02:33.821
My dad didn't die.

02:33.854 --> 02:34.955
I have an extra dad.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.624
If anything,
I have the opposite problem.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.492
Now if you'll excuse me,

02:38.526 --> 02:40.328
I'll be in my bastard room
doing bastard things.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.796
-Yeah.
-Mm.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.365
Messy.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.234
Your parents really let
their screwed up relationship

02:46.267 --> 02:47.901
bone the whole family, huh?

02:47.935 --> 02:49.337
W-Well, yeah, but I mean,

02:49.370 --> 02:51.872
-you're not exactly an expert
on healthy relationships. -Hey.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.242
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Oh, come on, you and Jimmy

02:54.275 --> 02:55.743
are the most dysfunctional
couple I've ever seen.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.478
You fight constantly,
you're never affectionate.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.413
You burned his ass off.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.815
Yeah, those are, uh,
th-those are ups and downs.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.251
Every relationship
has them, but...

03:03.284 --> 03:04.885
You won't even call him
your boyfriend.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.186
He's not my boyfriend,
that's why.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.588
He's my, he's my guy. Uh, look.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.089
I don't want to
explain it to you.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.691
I don't need to
explain it to you.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.726
Because Jimmy and I understand
each other, and we're fine.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.761
Well, hon, it's been a while

03:13.794 --> 03:14.862
since you two
have been intimate.

03:14.895 --> 03:15.863
Damn it, Alba!

03:15.896 --> 03:17.898
You got to stop
spying on us, okay.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.033
I am not.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.569
You guys mind your business,
all right.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.404
Jimmy and I are not the ones
dragging everybody

03:23.437 --> 03:24.838
through their messy divorce.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.040
What's divorce?

03:28.075 --> 03:31.412
Uh... Mick, you want to
take this one?

03:34.615 --> 03:35.883
Damn it.

03:41.289 --> 03:44.458
Chip. W-What are you doing?

03:44.492 --> 03:46.226
Nothing much.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.762
-Just burning some lies.
-Wha...?

03:48.796 --> 03:50.598
You're burning
your baseball glove?

03:50.631 --> 03:53.601
I used to play catch with my dad
all the time, but...

03:53.634 --> 03:56.804
since I no longer have a dad,
there's no point.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.573
Ah...

03:59.607 --> 04:02.142
Okay, oh.
You need to see this.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.812
I googled your real father
and it turns out

04:04.845 --> 04:06.046
he's a pretty decent guy.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.748
You know, h-he's a widower,

04:07.781 --> 04:09.383
and he just
finished fourth in a 10k

04:09.417 --> 04:11.419
to raise awareness for lymphoma.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.987
I think you should know him.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.256
You know, when my father
was on his deathbed,

04:16.290 --> 04:18.559
it took all the strength he had

04:18.592 --> 04:22.296
to open his eyes,
and-and he looked up at me,

04:22.330 --> 04:25.333
-and he said, "I'm...
-Damn! My dad's rich as balls!

04:25.366 --> 04:26.967
He owns an outdoor
recreation company,

04:27.000 --> 04:28.502
and he's worth half a billy?

04:28.536 --> 04:29.937
I'm back, baby!

04:29.970 --> 04:32.239
Their headquarters are in
Stamford; it's ten minutes away.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.174
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt
to take a look at the guy.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.576
Okay. Let's go. I will drive.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.245
-Okay.
-Yeah.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.781
-(woman moaning) -Hey, Jimmy,
listen, we need to talk...

04:40.814 --> 04:42.916
(grunts)

04:42.950 --> 04:44.352
What you doing?

04:44.385 --> 04:46.854
Nothing. You know,
I was just reading the news.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.322
-Oh, you're reading the news...
-Uh-huh.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.923
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool.
-Yeah.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.025
What's going on in the news?

04:52.059 --> 04:54.127
Well, uh, you know,
I don't know, for starters:

04:54.161 --> 04:56.163
-the whole world's going
to hell. -Oh, yeah.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.398
-You know, so there's that.
-Yeah.

04:58.666 --> 04:59.633
What?

04:59.667 --> 05:01.369
Oh.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.803
-(laughing)
-Yeah. You think I was...

05:02.836 --> 05:04.037
-Yeah...
-Yeah, well,

05:04.071 --> 05:05.439
that's funny
that you think that.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.375
-But I wasn't. -Okay. Um...
can I borrow your computer?

05:07.408 --> 05:08.876
'Cause I got to check my e-mail.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.644
No, I, see, I know
what you're doing, okay?

05:10.678 --> 05:12.045
Come on.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.448
And just so you know, I don't
use a computer to do that, so...

05:14.482 --> 05:15.616
Right. Right.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.117
Why would I use a computer
when I can just

05:17.150 --> 05:19.219
-think about you?
-Oh, my God.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.688
-No, that's true. I do.
-Eh.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.656
I think about you, all right?
I do. Okay?

05:22.690 --> 05:24.124
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.659
Maybe sometimes
there are other people there.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.695
-Mm. -Well,
I'm just saying, you know,

05:27.728 --> 05:30.831
make my mind...
it's like this gym.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.401
-Eh, um, sorry, a gym?
-Yeah.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.035
And you're there.
You're-you're running

05:35.068 --> 05:36.670
around the track on the outside.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.138
I mean, sure, yeah,
there are other people there.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.673
And they're-they're
using the machines,

05:39.707 --> 05:41.542
and maybe I check them out
for a sec, you know?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.544
Hmm, see what kind of exercises
they're doing.

05:43.577 --> 05:47.014
But sure enough, you always come
running back around.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.316
And then I'm looking at you.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.518
And I'm in the middle.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.620
Tugging on it?

05:54.021 --> 05:55.756
No. I, uh, what--
you're putting...

05:55.789 --> 05:57.725
-What're you doing, all right?
-Yeah.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.259
'Cause you're coming in here
like the NSA!

05:59.292 --> 06:00.761
You're demanding my hard drive!

06:00.794 --> 06:02.195
And now, you're sticking things
in my mouth.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.363
Why are you yelling at me?

06:03.397 --> 06:04.765
Because I don't want you
in here!

06:04.798 --> 06:06.166
I didn't come in here
to fight with you.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.436
I actually came in 'cause
I wanted to talk about us,

06:08.469 --> 06:10.103
but I've-- yeah,
th-the mood has passed,

06:10.137 --> 06:11.772
and I don't anymore, all right.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.307
Enjoy... your, uh, the news.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.281
(indistinct chatter)

06:25.419 --> 06:27.455
Daddy?

06:27.488 --> 06:30.390
Excuse me? Can I help you?

06:30.424 --> 06:31.959
Uh, no.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.027
(men chuckling)

06:34.061 --> 06:37.130
Just, uh, got to use the
restroom.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.135
(chuckles nervously)

06:42.169 --> 06:44.071
That's a pretty big fish.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.405
Excuse me?

06:45.439 --> 06:47.908
The picture of you out front.
So cool.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.478
Oh, the marlin. Right.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.481
You an intern or something?

06:53.514 --> 06:56.116
Uh, yeah, uh, I-I'm an intern.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.452
I'm here working for free, so...

06:58.486 --> 07:00.654
What are you, like, 14?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.890
Uh, I'm exactly 14.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.758
What are you,
a frickin' psychic?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.460
I got a daughter your age.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.962
Wish someone could instill
that work ethic in her.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.566
Well, I'm big into ethics.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.569
At school,
they call me "Kid Ethics."

07:15.603 --> 07:17.605
-Right. Well, I'm done draining.
See you around. -Uh-huh.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.409
(chuckles)
Didn't even wash his hands.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.944
Such a badass.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.480
So Mom and Dad still love us,

07:26.514 --> 07:28.181
they just don't want
to be married anymore?

07:28.215 --> 07:29.683
Yeah, you got it. Nice job, bud.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.351
Hey, uh, have you guys
seen Mickey?

07:31.384 --> 07:32.686
I need to talk to her.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.254
Are you getting a divorce?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.455
What? No.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.990
Why would you ask me that?

07:37.024 --> 07:38.091
Because I heard you fighting

07:38.125 --> 07:39.527
and Sabrina said
if you fight too much,

07:39.560 --> 07:40.994
you're gonna get divorced.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.696
You know what, Ben?
With all due respect,

07:42.730 --> 07:44.665
what Mickey and I have
works for us,

07:44.698 --> 07:46.667
and we don't need
to explain ourselves to you,

07:46.700 --> 07:47.835
or any other little kid.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.202
Why are you fighting?

07:49.236 --> 07:50.971
Because your aunt
just walked in on me

07:51.004 --> 07:52.940
in the middle
of r-reading the news.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.474
She caught you masturbating?

07:54.508 --> 07:55.776
-Gross.
-No.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.345
What's that?

07:58.378 --> 08:00.814
-Have fun with that one.
-No, I don't want to.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.616
Please tell me. I have to know.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.518
What are the rules?
Who's the master?

08:04.552 --> 08:05.953
Can I be the master?

08:05.986 --> 08:07.688
Teach me everything.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.858
-(man moaning)
-Mick, I'm sorry I...

08:10.891 --> 08:12.225
-(buzzing stops)
-Oh.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.395
What the hell is going on?

08:15.428 --> 08:17.164
-I'm masturbating.
-And don't you dare

08:17.197 --> 08:18.899
tell me that you were
reading the news,

08:18.932 --> 08:20.834
because we both know
that's not true.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.302
No, I just told you,
I'm masturbating.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.705
Aha! So you admit it?

08:24.738 --> 08:26.339
Yes, I've admitted it
multiple times,

08:26.373 --> 08:28.375
and I was actually kind of
ramping up to something,

08:28.408 --> 08:30.310
so if we could circle back
to this in a couple minutes...

08:30.343 --> 08:31.812
I don't know
who you are anymore, Mick.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.647
You're being so weird
about all of this.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.982
It's not a big deal.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.584
It's betrayal, is what it is.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.352
I just walked in on you
doing the exact same thing.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.488
First, you didn't grow up
like I did.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.156
And guys do it
because they're different.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.358
-How?
-I'm a man, and I need it.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.194
You're a hypocrite,
is what you are.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.896
At least I'm not a cheater.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.431
-(buzzing)
-What's that?

08:51.464 --> 08:54.668
Sorry, it's just really hard
to hear you.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.870
(buzzing continues)

08:56.904 --> 08:58.305
-Shut the door.
-(door closes)

09:02.976 --> 09:04.745
That is not fair. You promised!

09:04.778 --> 09:06.680
You're 14 years old.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.216
-You're not going to a concert
alone. -Okay, that makes sense.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.852
I get punished because Lindsay
got food poisoning?

09:11.885 --> 09:14.955
God, you are such
a spineless dick!

09:16.724 --> 09:19.026
Urinal kid?
What are you doing here?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.629
-So sorry. Wrong office.
I-I got to... -Wait.

09:21.662 --> 09:22.796
Come here.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.468
What are you up to tonight?

09:28.501 --> 09:30.871
(chuckles)
Me? Nothing.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.472
I-I mean, like, I'm super busy.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.407
I got a ton of stuff,
but it can all move.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.143
You want to take my daughter
to a concert?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.779
She's much nicer than that,
I promise.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.580
What do you say? My treat.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.549
I don't know. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.984
-R-Really.
-Come on. You'd be doing me

09:44.017 --> 09:46.019
a really big favor, son.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.389
ALBA:
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.558
Let me try to understand this.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.828
So, instead of telling your dad
that you are his son,

09:54.862 --> 09:57.497
you asked your sister
out on a date?

09:57.530 --> 10:00.000
-Ugh.
-No. He asked me.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.835
Chip, listen, I know
you haven't had much luck

10:01.869 --> 10:03.837
with the ladies,
but this is not the answer.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.173
You're just jealous because
my new sister's hotter than you.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.407
Oh, you think I'm hot?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.276
N... That's not what I said.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.479
No, you said I'm hot,
she's hotter,

10:12.512 --> 10:15.282
-and we're both
your sister, so... -Mm.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.250
You Buckleys
are pretty creepy, huh?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.653
Shut up. At least we build
companies and earn our money.

10:19.687 --> 10:22.155
We don't inherit and steal
like your jailbird dad.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.423
Alba, let's go.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.125
-Okay, let me just finish.
-Alba!

10:25.158 --> 10:26.126
I got to go!

10:26.159 --> 10:28.095
Okay! Okay. Ugh.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.798
Mmm. Ah.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.332
(sniffs)
Don't worry.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.435
I will not let this night
be tarnished by incest.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.537
What's incest?

10:37.570 --> 10:39.673
Okay. Ben?

10:39.707 --> 10:41.374
How about this: tonight,

10:41.408 --> 10:42.876
I'll answer
all the questions you've got.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.212
After that, never again. Deal?

10:45.245 --> 10:47.480
Deal. Now, tell me
all about incest.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.982
Is it about bugs?

10:49.016 --> 10:50.550
I wish, buddy.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.785
(knocking on door)

10:51.819 --> 10:52.953
JIMMY:
What?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.521
It's me. Can I come in?

10:54.554 --> 10:55.889
Fine.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.358
I'm opening the door, slowly.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.399
Hey.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.070
What's going on with us?

11:10.103 --> 11:12.072
I don't know, man.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.807
We've been in this rut
for a while,

11:13.841 --> 11:16.543
and then Sabrina and Alba start
chirping in my ear.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.712
Yeah, little Ben
really spun me out, too.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.480
-Did he?
-Yeah.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.315
You know what, who cares?
Why are we listening to them?

11:22.349 --> 11:23.717
-I don't know.
-They don't get us.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.886
No, they don't. Because what
we have is different.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.687
That's what I keep saying.
It's different.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.856
Yeah, it is.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.490
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.525
Yeah.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.530
Look, I can never
unburn your ass.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.732
I know that.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.233
What do you say we start over?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.837
Okay.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.672
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.707
I'm Jimmy.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.844
And if you're not doing anything
later, I'd like to take you out.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.712
I would like that.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.082
What's... what's that?

11:55.115 --> 11:56.516
It was a...

11:56.549 --> 11:57.918
Yeah, it's like a weird,
old-timey... thing.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.186
-You...
-I don't like it.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.587
-Bad move.
-Yeah. It's okay.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.721
-Okay.
-Okay.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.295
(laughs softly)

12:10.630 --> 12:12.265
-Stuff on the walls. -Man,
when was the last time you

12:12.299 --> 12:13.867
had a patty mel... What's up?

12:13.901 --> 12:16.736
What-- no, sorry. Um, what?

12:16.770 --> 12:18.638
No, you were
talking about walls?

12:18.671 --> 12:21.208
Yeah, well, they got just
an old hockey stick over there.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.543
Looks like it's seen
a lot of games.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.245
-Yeah. I see it.
-Yeah.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.880
-Neat.
-Right?

12:26.914 --> 12:28.816
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.617
-So, uh, what's going on?
-Hmm?

12:30.650 --> 12:32.585
-What's new?
-Mm...

12:32.619 --> 12:35.055
Um, ooh! There was something I
was gonna remember to tell you.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.890
-Yeah? Like a dream you had?
-Oh, no, it wasn't a dream.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.826
-Oh, like, a YouTube video?
-No.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.160
-A show? You guys watching
shows? -It's actually...

12:40.193 --> 12:41.728
Thank you. It's not helpful
when you talk, though.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.930
-Okay. -Because--
no, just with the--

12:42.963 --> 12:44.431
-it's hard for me
to think of it. -Right.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.266
I can't remember.

12:46.299 --> 12:49.803
-Well, they have a deep fryer...
-Oh, they got croquet mallets.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.172
-It's-- oh, another wall thing
to look at? -Yeah.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.573
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.608
-This is weird, right?
Why are we so off? -Yeah.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.745
Maybe we should get some drinks.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.447
-Of course we need drinks.
-Yeah.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.349
-What are we doing without
drinks? -I don't know.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.917
Hey, can we get a couple beers
over here, please?

13:03.951 --> 13:05.118
-Yeah, a couple shots, too.
-Yeah,

13:05.152 --> 13:06.486
and I'll take the wine list.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.188
-Yeah, ooh.
-Yeah, right?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.759
(doorbell rings)

13:12.792 --> 13:15.262
Urinal kid, come on in.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.164
Good to see you.
Kelly will be right down.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.598
Ah, tell her to take her time.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.267
Happy to hang here with you.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.970
Name's Chip, by the way,
not "urinal kid."

13:23.003 --> 13:24.972
Chip. Might want to change that

13:25.005 --> 13:27.207
to a man's name
when puberty hits.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.609
Oh, yeah, totally.
Hate my name, always have.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.278
Even before just now.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.313
I'm just messing with you.
It's a fine name.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.148
Ah! I'm just messing
with you, back.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.284
-What a fun exchange.
-Come on, let's go.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.019
-Uh, you sure? No rush.
-(door opens)

13:39.052 --> 13:41.521
I'm happy to keep talking
to Dad-- y-your dad.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.722
You guys have fun.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.057
Back by midnight, okay?

13:44.091 --> 13:45.358
I'm serious.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.496
So, uh, who's playing tonight?

13:49.529 --> 13:50.830
I frickin' love music.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.365
Oh, no, we're not going
to the concert.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.202
This guy I like has a house to
himself, and he invited me over.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.337
So you can just drop me there
or whatever.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.806
-But, I-I promised your dad...
-I don't care.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.474
And if you say anything
to my dad,

14:01.508 --> 14:03.076
I will tell him
you whipped it out.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.345
Whoa, whoa! What? No, calm down.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.347
Nobody's whipping anything out.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.582
Driver, we need to change
our drop-off.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.518
Uh, yeah, but, sir,

14:11.551 --> 14:13.921
uh, shouldn't you stick to the
original plan for the evening?

14:13.954 --> 14:15.989
Wait, w-why is our Uber driver
talking to us?

14:16.023 --> 14:18.191
(scoffs)
Yeah, butt out, lady,

14:18.225 --> 14:20.060
or I'll hit you
with a frickin' one star.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.563
-(chuckles softly)
-Huh.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.433
-(burps)
-(laughs)

14:26.466 --> 14:29.102
-MICKEY: You did not see
the Beatles in concert. -I did.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.737
-It was a secret show.
-So stupid.

14:30.770 --> 14:33.240
Oh, what-- hey, can we get
another round, please?

14:33.273 --> 14:36.543
Why don't you just focus
on this round for now?

14:36.576 --> 14:37.945
-(scoffs) Oh, yeah?
-Oh...

14:37.978 --> 14:39.379
I smell a challenge.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.914
-Is that what it was?
-(burps): Yeah.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.349
Oh, guess what?

14:42.382 --> 14:43.816
Challenge accepted.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.621
(gags, coughing)

14:48.655 --> 14:50.190
BARTENDER:
All right, that's it.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.691
-Time to close out.
-(Mickey retching)

14:51.724 --> 14:52.792
Why?

14:52.825 --> 14:54.461
What? Why?

14:54.494 --> 14:55.462
You just puked in your glass.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.964
No, I didn't.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.632
(slurring): I was just taking
a break from finishing it.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.867
I watched you.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.470
Oh, I don't think
I like your tone.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.706
If the lady says she didn't
vomit, she didn't vomit.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.308
I'm just telling you what I saw.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.143
Yeah, well, maybe you need
to get your eyes checked,

15:10.177 --> 15:14.081
because what I see
is a nice, crisp beer.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.415
-Dude, don't. -MICKEY:
Jimmy, I really wouldn't.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.151
Why? If I'm thirsty,
why wouldn't I drink a beer?

15:18.185 --> 15:19.619
I would...
(gags)

15:23.323 --> 15:24.557
(exhales)

15:24.591 --> 15:26.126
That's good.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.961
It was a little hoppy,
but I think somebody

15:27.995 --> 15:29.796
owes the lady an apology.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.300
BARTENDER:
Ugh...

15:33.333 --> 15:35.002
Whoa, whoa, hey, uh, whoa.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.903
You come back again,
and I'm calling the cops.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.106
-Oh, ooh.
-Would we want to come back?

15:39.139 --> 15:41.641
-(laughs) Your bar smells
like puke. -(door closes)

15:41.674 --> 15:43.643
(both chuckle)

15:43.676 --> 15:46.980
-He doesn't get us.
-Nobody gets us.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.515
Thanks for that, by the way.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.984
-Oh, you like that, do you?
-No, it was gross.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.820
I don't like it. I don't want--
ever want you to do it again.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.288
But for a second there,
you know,

15:55.322 --> 15:56.956
when you were dressing
that guy down?

15:56.990 --> 15:58.091
I like that.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.692
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.295
Well, what do you say
we head back to the house and...

16:02.329 --> 16:04.431
read the news?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.133
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.168
Why do we need a house?

16:15.375 --> 16:16.509
CHIP:
It's almost midnight.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.145
What the frick
is going on in there?

16:18.178 --> 16:20.647
Aw, Chip, come on, buddy.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.682
CHIP:
I'm gonna go scope it out.

16:31.858 --> 16:35.462
JORDAN:
Hey, Jenna, what's up, babe?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.530
No, I'm not busy.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.732
Cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just give me a few minutes to,

16:39.766 --> 16:41.701
-uh, take out the trash.
-(Chip mouths)

16:41.734 --> 16:43.736
See you soon, gorgeous.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.146
-Hey, what took you so long?
-Ah...

16:53.180 --> 16:55.348
That was my mom.
She's gonna be home pretty soon.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.716
Oh. Okay.
(clicks tongue)

16:56.749 --> 16:58.218
-I'll call a car.
-No, no, no.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.019
I-I didn't mean...
We can still, you know.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.421
We just got to be quick.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.755
Oh, okay.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.092
Liar! He is a liar.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.326
-He's a...
-Who the hell are you?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.927
What the hell
are you doing in here?

17:07.960 --> 17:09.196
That wasn't his mom
on the phone.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.897
It was Jenna.
She's on her way now.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.400
You're kicking me out for Jenna?

17:13.433 --> 17:15.068
Ah, God.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.070
Whatever. It's not like
we're dating, anyways.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.005
You said you liked me, you ass.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.741
All right,
if you're gonna be a bitch,

17:21.774 --> 17:23.243
then you should just go.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.212
Whoa. You want
to disrespect me? Fine.

17:25.245 --> 17:26.546
But you will not disrespect her,

17:26.579 --> 17:27.947
and you will certainly
not disrespect

17:27.980 --> 17:29.982
Howard frickin' Buckley!

17:32.219 --> 17:34.020
(crying): He didn't have
to disrespect me like that.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.123
Oh, forget that jerk.

17:36.156 --> 17:40.593
Um, thank you for, uh,
having my back.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.262
You're sweet.
(chuckles)

17:42.295 --> 17:44.030
Yeah, I'll always
have your back.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.898
No matter what.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.300
You shouldn't be
wasting your time

17:47.334 --> 17:48.701
on a creep like that anyways.

17:48.735 --> 17:52.071
I mean, you're... you're pretty,

17:52.105 --> 17:55.007
you're smart,
super frickin' chill...

17:58.178 --> 17:59.779
No, no, no. It's...

17:59.812 --> 18:01.414
We can't. I-It's not...

18:01.448 --> 18:03.049
it's not... it's not you.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.551
-I just... I want...
-Okay, okay. Hey, Chip. Chip.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.652
Relax.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.953
It'll be worth it.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.321
I promise.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.925
What the hell.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.930
-(horn honking repeatedly)
-ALBA: Chip! No!

18:17.964 --> 18:20.400
-No, we can't. It's not right.
-Okay, okay. Wh-What's wrong?

18:20.433 --> 18:22.502
I-I got to tell you something,
something crazy.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.937
All right. What is it?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.641
(sighs)
14 years ago,

18:28.675 --> 18:31.344
my mom had an affair
with your dad.

18:32.979 --> 18:35.282
I am the bastard love child
of that affair.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.584
What are you talking about?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.952
Kelly, I'm your brother.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.321
-What?
-Look, I know

18:41.354 --> 18:43.256
-it sounds crazy... Aah!
-No!

18:43.290 --> 18:45.458
No, I... I don't know
what you're talking about,

18:45.492 --> 18:47.827
b-but you're psycho, and just
stay away from me, weirdo!

18:47.860 --> 18:50.530
(low gasping)

18:50.563 --> 18:52.632
-Ow! Ah, no, the pipes.
-You all right? You okay?

18:52.665 --> 18:54.100
You know what, how about this,
how about this:

18:54.133 --> 18:56.102
-you just put your head down,
okay? -Okay. Ow!

18:56.135 --> 18:57.204
-You okay?
-Hold still.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.271
-You hold still.
-MICKEY: Ow!

18:58.305 --> 19:00.273
-JIMMY: Whoa!
-Hey!

19:00.307 --> 19:02.642
-What's going on? -Hey,
mind your own business, pal.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.976
Hey, get off of her!

19:04.010 --> 19:06.379
-Yeah, you like assaulting
women? -No, no, no. No!

19:06.413 --> 19:08.781
-(grunts)
-MICKEY: Oh! Oh!

19:08.815 --> 19:10.283
Aah! Oh!

19:10.317 --> 19:12.519
-Yeah, man! We got you.
-Guys, stop! No! Oh!

19:12.552 --> 19:15.855
No, no, wait, wait, wait!
It was consensual!

19:15.888 --> 19:17.924
-MAN: Son of a bitch!
-Oh!

19:22.495 --> 19:24.564
(Chip grunting, wheezing)

19:24.597 --> 19:26.299
ALBA:
Chip!

19:26.333 --> 19:30.069
At this point, no good
can come from knowing this man!

19:30.102 --> 19:32.372
-I'm sorry, I'm so sor...
-(crying) -I can explain.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.173
You whipped it out
in front of my daughter?

19:34.207 --> 19:36.042
-Whoa, what? No!
-You're fired.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.510
Well, I never...
really worked there.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.347
-I was just kind of saying that
to meet you. -See? I told you.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.915
-This kid is a freak!
-Get the hell out of my house.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.717
Pamela Pemberton.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.086
-What?
-14 years ago, you...

19:47.119 --> 19:49.389
you slept with a woman
named Pamela Pemberton.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.392
-Poodle?
-Th-That's my mom.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.527
I'm... your son.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.962
(exhales)

19:58.130 --> 20:00.600
Stay the hell away
from me and my family.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.905
Alba, you blew it!

20:05.938 --> 20:08.074
-So, what did we learn?
-That brothers and sisters

20:08.107 --> 20:10.710
shouldn't kiss,
because it's icky and gross.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.346
And their babies would have
all sorts of health problems.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.714
Where do babies come from?

20:14.747 --> 20:16.082
Huh. Kind of feels like

20:16.115 --> 20:17.950
we should've
covered that earlier.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.919
Where do babies live
before they're babies?

20:19.952 --> 20:21.788
How old's the oldest baby?

20:21.821 --> 20:24.123
It's gonna be really fun
to see how you turn out.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.392
(chuckles)

20:25.425 --> 20:28.261
-So he's your boyfriend?
-He-- no, I, see, he...

20:28.295 --> 20:29.596
It's complicated.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.531
So what happened was consensual?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.533
Yes. It was my idea.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.369
Do you need a place
to stay tonight?

20:36.403 --> 20:39.406
-We can take you to a shelter.
-I don't want to go to a shel...

20:39.439 --> 20:41.774
I will have you know
I live in a mansion, okay?

20:41.808 --> 20:44.577
(stammers) It doesn't...
Can you just please uncuff him?

20:44.611 --> 20:46.045
Thank you.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.581
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

20:51.484 --> 20:53.686
Be a little smarter next time.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.858
(engine starts)

21:01.093 --> 21:02.929
(siren chirps)

21:08.668 --> 21:11.137
How did we get here?

21:11.170 --> 21:12.972
Oh, I don't know.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.074
I mean, I remember driving,
but I don't know

21:15.107 --> 21:16.976
-where I parked, so...
-No. No, I mean,

21:17.009 --> 21:18.678
I'm talking
about our relationship.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.647
It's just not healthy.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.482
I know.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.618
You know, we keep saying that...

21:25.652 --> 21:28.488
nobody gets us, but...

21:28.521 --> 21:30.723
maybe we don't get us.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.694
*

21:38.631 --> 21:40.533
We had a good run, Mick.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.003
Yeah, we did.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.611
Like the Patriots
in the early 2000s.

21:51.644 --> 21:55.147
Can we just sit and... enjoy
the silence for a little bit?

21:56.716 --> 21:58.451
You got it, Mick.
