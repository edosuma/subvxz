[music fades]

01:48.041 --> 01:50.958
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh. Right.

01:51.041 --> 01:53.458
Well, no need to worry, Mr. Mason.

01:53.541 --> 01:57.500
Traptech can solve
your little rat problem.

01:57.583 --> 01:58.416
Little?

01:58.958 --> 02:02.291
It's an armed rat fucking rebellion,
is what it is.

-[chuckling] Well, no.
-[cat purring]

02:03.916 --> 02:06.666
We're seeing quite a lot of this lately,
Mr. Mason.

02:06.750 --> 02:07.916
Evolution, you see.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.500
Humanity is warping the environment,

02:10.583 --> 02:13.958
forcing the animal kingdom to adapt,
et cetera, et cetera.

02:14.041 --> 02:16.708
A certain level of tool use
is nothing to worry about.

02:16.791 --> 02:17.625
Aye, aye.

02:17.708 --> 02:22.000
Less Darwinian theory,
more rodent-killing hardware.

02:32.541 --> 02:35.500
The very latest in Traptech-nology.

02:35.583 --> 02:38.500
With just four of these killing machines
in each barn,

02:38.583 --> 02:42.041
and you really can "Fire and Forget."

02:43.041 --> 02:44.041
[sighing heavily]

02:44.125 --> 02:45.250
How much?

02:46.541 --> 02:48.416
Do I really need all this shite?

02:48.916 --> 02:51.458
Is this not a bit fucking overkill?

02:52.708 --> 02:57.208
Well, you can't be too careful
when it comes to pest control, Mr. Mason.

02:57.291 --> 03:01.750

[chuckling] How about that? Look at that.

[cat meowing]

03:10.208 --> 03:12.750
Ah, yes.

03:12.833 --> 03:17.125
We do advise that you keep other animals
clear of the kill zone.

[Mason] Hmm?

03:50.208 --> 03:51.125
What the fuck?

03:51.958 --> 03:54.625
You clever little bastard.

03:54.708 --> 03:55.833
[music fades]

03:58.458 --> 04:01.458
Hmm. I was worried this might happen.

04:01.541 --> 04:04.500
Well, Mr. Mason,
there's only one thing for it.

04:04.583 --> 04:07.791
We're gonna have to go mobile.

04:07.875 --> 04:12.833
The all new TT-15
with gas-cooled auto-cannon,

04:12.916 --> 04:16.208
armored chassis,
and the same targeting tech

04:16.291 --> 04:18.333
that navy drones carry.

04:18.416 --> 04:21.500
Now that is what I call tool use.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.041
[sighing heavily] How much?

04:25.125 --> 04:28.625
[man] Right, well,
we've recovered four of the TT6s,

04:28.708 --> 04:30.625
but it says here you had five.

04:30.708 --> 04:33.250
Ah, well, fucking rats trashed them.

04:33.333 --> 04:36.375
[sighing] I'm afraid
I'll still have to report them missing.

04:37.458 --> 04:39.916
[man] Good luck with that TT-15!
