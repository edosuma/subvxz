I can't believe I've been
hanging out with
you guys all day

00:13.224 --> 00:16.015
and no one's even noticed
that I don't even go to
this school.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.348
They don't care
if you're here.

00:17.348 --> 00:19.560

00:25.526 --> 00:28.649
I was just talking to
Mike Thompson.

00:28.649 --> 00:31.572
And he asked for Daisy's
phone number,
so I gave him mine.

00:31.572 --> 00:33.074
Gave him yours?
Shelby!

00:34.615 --> 00:36.287
It's the second rule
of girl code!

00:36.287 --> 00:37.618
The first rule is fries
are healthier

00:37.618 --> 00:40.371
if you order them
for the table.

00:40.371 --> 00:42.963
No, I gave him mine
because Daisy doesn't
have a phone.

00:42.963 --> 00:44.625

 It's him!

00:45.876 --> 00:48.429
He said "uraqtjs".

What language is that?

00:50.050 --> 00:52.303
Oh, he's not a
Hill Person, is he?

00:52.303 --> 00:54.175
My cousin dated
a Hill Person.

00:54.175 --> 00:55.726
Her father was not
pleased.

00:57.178 --> 01:01.021
No, it means, "U-R-A-Q-T-J-S".

01:01.021 --> 01:03.104
It means, "You are a cutie,
just sayin'".

01:03.104 --> 01:04.644
He's flirting with you.

01:04.644 --> 01:05.896

01:05.896 --> 01:07.898
I really don't think
I should.

01:07.898 --> 01:10.321
Of course you shouldn't!
You've never
text-flirted before.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.992
We'll do it.

01:11.992 --> 01:15.286

three seasons.

It wouldn't be right to
court another

03:47.608 --> 03:48.849
were free
to do the same.

Wait. Cyd and I can
jump back to 1522

03:53.023 --> 03:54.775

thing to do.

So how do we
find this guy?

Well, he frequents
an inn called
the Crossed Swords

04:09.960 --> 04:12.753
and has a birthmark
in the shape of Italy
on his arm.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.875
Oh! Also I have
this pouch.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.798
It contains an image
of him and a kerchief
with his scent.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.220
You keep a pouch
of this guy's stuff
with you at all times?

04:20.220 --> 04:22.593
You keep a pouch
of pizza rolls on
you at all times.

04:22.593 --> 04:25.095
This isn't about me,
it's about Daisy!

04:25.095 --> 04:26.807
Oh, and his name
is Sebastian.

04:26.807 --> 04:29.229
Ooh, Sebastian,
that's a hot guy name.

04:29.229 --> 04:31.562
Are you sure you want to
break up with him?

04:31.562 --> 04:33.444

 Right, yes, sorry,
jumping!

04:35.155 --> 04:37.528

Wow.
So this is the 1500's.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.534
It's dirtier than
I thought it would be.

04:45.666 --> 04:47.998
I really should have peed
before we left.

04:47.998 --> 04:50.411
Where do you think
the bathroom is?

04:50.411 --> 04:53.504
From the smell of it,
anywhere.

04:53.504 --> 04:55.175
Come on, let's just find
Sebastian.

04:56.337 --> 05:00.591
Oi! You ain't from here!

05:00.591 --> 05:02.843
How does he know?
It's our teeth,
they're too clean!

05:02.843 --> 05:04.925
We have too many of them!

I don't wanna see you
in my place again.

I destroyed you. Again!

05:50.020 --> 05:51.351
You are the worst.

I can't believe there is
no one left in
the entire school

05:55.896 --> 05:57.528
who will play this
game with you, Barry.

05:57.528 --> 05:59.069
I'm having a blast.

06:01.281 --> 06:04.244
Hey guys, Shelby and Cyd
are helping me with a problem,

06:04.244 --> 06:06.827
and I need something
to take my mind off of it.

06:06.827 --> 06:08.409
Can I hang
out with you?

06:08.409 --> 06:10.200
Sure, have a seat.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.754
Renaldo and I are locked
in combat as the kingdom
of Barrydonia wages war

06:13.754 --> 06:16.126
against the kingdom of
Steve Harvey.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.500
We picked our own
kingdom names.

06:20.761 --> 06:21.882
You wanna play with us?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.634
I would love to!
How do I play?

06:23.634 --> 06:25.095
It's incredibly complicated.

06:25.095 --> 06:26.967
It would take far
too long to explain.

06:26.967 --> 06:28.929
The card with
the better spell wins.

06:28.929 --> 06:31.351
I'll try to keep up.

06:31.351 --> 06:33.273
Okay, princess.
But I must warn you.

06:33.273 --> 06:35.436
We play for keeps.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.938
You see,
these used to be
Renaldo's.

06:37.938 --> 06:39.069
I'm not very good.

06:40.781 --> 06:42.112
Prepare to lose, Daisy.

06:42.112 --> 06:43.574
I have the
perfect strategy.

06:45.656 --> 06:48.449
Your strategy was to lose
every single hand

06:48.449 --> 06:51.912
in a series of increasingly
humiliating defeats?

06:51.912 --> 06:53.333
Wow, I would
have never seen
that coming.

06:55.245 --> 06:57.417
I attack with
my unicorn army.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.960
I defend with this
"Other Games You
Might Enjoy

06:59.960 --> 07:01.672
"from Bingaling
Entertainment" card.

07:04.134 --> 07:05.345
Daisy, you won!

07:05.345 --> 07:06.717
I can't believe you beat me!

07:06.717 --> 07:08.639
Are you sure you haven't
played this game before?

07:08.639 --> 07:11.932
Never. But we did have
something similar
back in my time.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.815
It was called,
"The castle is under attack!"

07:14.815 --> 07:18.188
But instead of cards,
the winner got
to keep their head.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

07:20.230 --> 07:21.482
I'm giving you
your cards back.

07:21.482 --> 07:22.863
You can't do that.
The only way

07:22.863 --> 07:24.825
I can get them back
is to win them.

07:24.825 --> 07:25.986
But I don't want your cards.

07:25.986 --> 07:28.118
Well, I'm sorry,
those are the rules.

07:28.118 --> 07:29.990
Without rules
there are no games.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.912
And then what's left
to win at, sports?

07:32.663 --> 07:35.415
I need games, Daisy.

07:35.415 --> 07:37.457
Barry, you don't have
any cards left.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.999
How can you play Sir
King's Knight Quest?

07:38.999 --> 07:40.841
We'll just have
to play something else.

07:40.841 --> 07:42.002
This looks like fun.

07:42.002 --> 07:43.504
What do I do with it?

07:43.504 --> 07:45.295
That game.
That's the game
we're gonna play.

07:55.686 --> 07:57.357
(GROANS)

07:57.357 --> 08:00.270
Cyd, I'm sorry the boys'
shoes we found didn't fit you.

08:00.270 --> 08:03.273
But we have
to blend in so we
can find Sebastian.

08:03.273 --> 08:05.696
Easy for you to say.
I look ridiculous.

08:05.696 --> 08:07.157
How does anybody
wear a dress?

08:07.157 --> 08:08.699
It's like being
in a giant pant leg.

08:10.410 --> 08:12.993
Just think of it as
getting into character.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.996
I'm Sheldon, small town
boy looking to make

08:15.996 --> 08:17.998
his dreams come true
in the big city,

08:17.998 --> 08:20.881
only to discover that
the shire chews you up
and spits you out.

08:20.881 --> 08:22.382
But I haven't found that
out yet, Cyd,

08:22.382 --> 08:24.424
I've still got
stars in my eyes.

08:25.586 --> 08:27.548
My backstory is
I'm a girl in a dress

08:27.548 --> 08:28.889
and I'm not happy
about it.

08:30.130 --> 08:32.011
Let's just go find
Sebastian.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.895
Oi! Wench. Back to
servin' with ye.

08:34.895 --> 08:37.136
Oh, I'm not a wench.
I'm Sheldon.

08:37.136 --> 08:38.899
(LOWER VOICE)
I mean, I'm Sheldon.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.734
I wasn't talking to ye.
I was talking to the wench.

08:43.734 --> 08:48.028
Back to work.
There's hungry knights
what need serving.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.410
First I have to wear
a dress, now I've
got to work?

08:50.410 --> 08:53.283
Don't worry, Cyd.
I'll find Sebastian.
It'll be easy.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.705
Daisy gave us
his picture.

08:54.705 --> 08:56.246
What are you waiting for?

08:56.246 --> 08:57.417
Get serving.

08:57.417 --> 08:58.789
I'm going, I'm going.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.290
Don't get your
doublet in a twist.

09:02.873 --> 09:05.505
This is supposed to be
a portrait of Sebastian?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.088
It looks terrible.

09:08.088 --> 09:09.590
It looks like someone
started to paint

09:09.590 --> 09:11.091
then immediately
forgot how to paint.

09:17.477 --> 09:18.889
On your left, Barry!

09:18.889 --> 09:20.180
Now your right!

09:20.180 --> 09:21.521
Over your head!

09:21.521 --> 09:23.273
These are the places
she's attacking you!

09:24.104 --> 09:25.816
(GROANS)

09:25.816 --> 09:29.489
Ha! I win. Sword drop!

09:31.692 --> 09:34.454
No one's ever beaten
me at Medieval Battle
Time before.

09:34.454 --> 09:36.657
Don't forget,
she also beat you at
Kingdom Stormers,

09:36.657 --> 09:39.499
Dragon Punch and
Princess Tea Party's
Fancy Fancy Good Time.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.254
You won,
so I must now
reluctantly hand over

09:44.254 --> 09:46.797
my Titans of Science
action figures.

09:46.797 --> 09:48.839
Thomas Edison has
a kung-fu grip

09:48.839 --> 09:50.881
on Nikola Tesla's patents.

09:51.972 --> 09:53.303
You don't
deserve these.

09:54.805 --> 09:56.306
I don't want them.

09:56.306 --> 09:59.890
In fact, I don't
want any of the things
I won from you.

10:01.311 --> 10:03.563
Well, they're yours,
you won the game.

10:03.563 --> 10:06.186
Those are the rules
and the rules
must be honored.

10:06.186 --> 10:09.650
Oh, I see.
This is about honor.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.532
Yes! But it's also about
being the best

10:12.532 --> 10:14.534
and then gloating
about it.

10:14.534 --> 10:17.868
I can't do that if you just
hand me my stuff back.

10:17.868 --> 10:21.241
You have to give me
the opportunity
to win it back!

10:21.241 --> 10:24.454
But Barry, she's won
every game we have.

10:24.454 --> 10:27.007
We will invent a game
that doesn't exist.

10:27.007 --> 10:29.800
And she won't be able
to win because we'll
be making up the rules

10:29.800 --> 10:31.131
as we go along.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.714
Oh, I like it.
We can call it Quarxnox!

10:33.714 --> 10:36.757
I'm sure we can think
of a better name
than Quarxnox.

10:36.757 --> 10:38.258
It's called Quarxnox?

10:38.258 --> 10:39.720
That's an odd name.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.682
It surprised me, too,
but that's what
we went with.

10:49.860 --> 10:51.271
Here's your dumb food.

10:51.271 --> 10:52.612
(BURPS)

10:53.113 --> 10:54.775
(LAUGHING)

10:56.536 --> 10:57.908
(BURPS)

10:57.908 --> 10:59.369
(LAUGHING LOUDER)

11:01.281 --> 11:03.954
You think that was good?
Check this out.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.245
(BURPS LOUDER)

11:05.245 --> 11:06.957
(LAUGHING LOUDER STILL)

11:09.710 --> 11:11.131
I could eat.

11:16.096 --> 11:17.387
(SPITS)

11:20.680 --> 11:22.803
Ho there, my good man.

11:22.803 --> 11:25.145
I am also a man,
and I am here to
talk to you

11:25.145 --> 11:28.438
about another member
of our gender, a male man.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.151
Not a mailman,
but a fellow fellow.

11:31.151 --> 11:32.402
This is not going well,
is it?

11:32.402 --> 11:33.693
Not very.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.868
I seek a knight
named Sebastian.

11:37.868 --> 11:40.320
I need to tell him
that Princess Daisy
doesn't want to marry him.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.123
Whoa. That's some pretty
juicy royal gossip.

11:43.123 --> 11:45.125
How do you know
what Princess Daisy wants?

11:45.125 --> 11:47.417
Well, she told me.
 You saw the princess?

11:47.417 --> 11:49.499
Yep that's right.
She's with me now.

11:49.499 --> 11:53.093
You expect me to believe
that Princess Daisy
is with you?

11:53.093 --> 11:55.255
Oh, yeah, she's with me
permanently.

11:55.255 --> 11:57.597
Couldn't send her back
if I wanted to.

11:57.597 --> 11:59.599
Ladies, right?
You want to send 'em back,

11:59.599 --> 12:01.762
but who'll do the laundry?
(CHUCKLES)

12:01.762 --> 12:04.344
I am offended by that...

12:04.344 --> 12:05.685
Is what a lady would say.

12:05.685 --> 12:07.557
But not me.
I think it's hilarious.

12:07.557 --> 12:09.059
(FORCED LAUGHTER)

12:11.351 --> 12:12.813
So if you could just point
me towards Sebastian,

12:12.813 --> 12:14.734
I can deliver my message.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.616
(GRUNTS)

12:16.616 --> 12:18.819
Thank you.
You're very kind.

12:18.819 --> 12:20.160
Also a huge chauvinist.

12:25.365 --> 12:27.788
Give it up,
soft-knuckles,
you got nothin'.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.629
Please, when I defeat you,

12:29.629 --> 12:33.503
you're gonna wash my horse
till it's so clean that
I can see my face in it.

12:33.503 --> 12:36.797
If you wanna see your
face in a horse,
just lift its tail.

12:41.141 --> 12:43.343
Birthmark in
the shape of Italy.

12:43.343 --> 12:45.305
Cyd! That's Sebastian!
 What?

12:45.305 --> 12:47.557
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

12:47.557 --> 12:49.599
Well, it looks like I
successfully pushed

12:49.599 --> 12:51.351
your hand down with my hand!

12:53.393 --> 12:55.195
Great, now I gotta
wash his horse!

12:55.195 --> 12:56.736
Why are you still talking?

12:56.736 --> 12:58.238
Get scrubbing.

13:00.951 --> 13:02.402
Wenches, right?

13:02.402 --> 13:04.534
I know,
they are the worst!

13:04.534 --> 13:05.826
I'm sorry, Cyd,
I love you!

13:12.752 --> 13:15.675
As determined by
the Quarxnox Wheel
Of Random Events,

13:15.675 --> 13:20.420
Daisy has been
banished to
the Island of Giant Cats.

13:20.420 --> 13:25.225
Well, the last three
hours have been fun,
but obviously I've lost.

13:25.225 --> 13:27.888
Now you can have
your things back.

13:27.888 --> 13:29.599
I could have had them back,

13:29.599 --> 13:32.062
but you just stepped
on the bonus button.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.563
You doubled your points!

13:33.563 --> 13:36.026
I'm gonna have to do
a lot of somersaults
to catch up with you now.

13:40.941 --> 13:43.493
Naldo, I have
a confession to make.

13:43.493 --> 13:45.205
I am not enjoying
Quarxnox.

13:45.205 --> 13:46.536
Then just let Barry win.

13:46.536 --> 13:49.709
I've been trying!
But the rules of
this game are baffling.

13:49.709 --> 13:51.711
Oh, I think I know why.

13:51.711 --> 13:53.583
It's because
we've been making
them up as we go along.

13:55.165 --> 13:57.047
Then why isn't
Barry winning?

13:57.047 --> 14:00.720
He's too proud to
not follow his own
crazy rules.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.343
I just want this game to
be over so I can leave.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.095
Don't worry,
I'll help you.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.057
Follow my lead.

14:07.057 --> 14:10.390
What's this?
A text from the Volcano
King.

14:10.390 --> 14:13.813
Any player whose name
begins with a "B" gets
10,000 points.

14:13.813 --> 14:17.027
(GASPS)
But that would mean that
that player would win.

14:17.027 --> 14:21.191
Barry, your name
starts with "B",
doesn't it, Barry?

14:21.191 --> 14:23.113
If only it did!

14:23.113 --> 14:25.906
But Barry is simply an
English form of the
Gaelic Bareth,

14:25.906 --> 14:27.697
which is short for
Funevar.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.452
I can't believe it.

14:32.452 --> 14:34.254
Don't blame yourself,
Daisy.

14:34.254 --> 14:36.706
I had no idea that Barry
started with an "F" either.

14:41.671 --> 14:46.596
Most people don't
realize that strength actually
comes from muscles.

14:46.596 --> 14:48.718
Yes. That's why I like
to have so many of them.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.851
Great stuff, great stuff.

14:54.564 --> 14:57.017
Listen, Sebastian,
I have a message
to deliver to you.

14:57.017 --> 14:58.478
From Princess Daisy.

14:58.478 --> 14:59.980
My betrothed?
What does she say?

15:01.521 --> 15:03.443
I don't know how
to say this.

15:03.443 --> 15:05.115
She doesn't want
to be engaged
to you anymore.

15:06.446 --> 15:08.288
How do I know that
you speak the truth?

15:08.288 --> 15:09.449
She gave me these.
 (GASPS)

15:09.449 --> 15:11.791
My portrait!
And my pit rag.

15:15.125 --> 15:19.129
Well, I regret to inform you,
tiny man, that Daisy
will be my wife

15:19.129 --> 15:20.961
and she has no choice
in the matter.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.302
She doesn't want
to marry you!

15:22.302 --> 15:25.305
Well, I didn't want a perfect
chin, but here we are.

15:26.306 --> 15:28.138
Daisy has to marry me.

15:28.138 --> 15:30.971
Unless, of course,
the princess is with
another bloke.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.816
Well, yes, obviously,
if there was another,

15:36.816 --> 15:40.110
then I would have no choice
but to release Daisy
from our engagement.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.983
But he would have
to come here
and declare himself.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.485
Unless, of course,
he was already here.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.489
Him?
 Me?

15:49.489 --> 15:51.201
You said Daisy
was with you!

15:51.201 --> 15:52.532
Well, yeah,
she's with me.

15:52.532 --> 15:54.074
But I didn't mean like...
 If that is the case,

15:54.074 --> 15:57.127
then I will have to end
my engagement.

15:57.127 --> 15:58.578
Then that is
totally the case.

15:58.578 --> 16:00.340
Daisy is with me.
That's the case
I'm talkin' about.

16:01.381 --> 16:02.842
So it is settled.

16:04.084 --> 16:07.137
All right, I washed
your stupid horse.

16:07.137 --> 16:09.179
But I'm keeping the change
I found under the saddle.

16:10.510 --> 16:12.012
You have declared
yourself.

16:12.012 --> 16:15.555
Now you and I will
fight for Daisy's
hand in marriage.

16:15.555 --> 16:17.187
To the death!

16:17.187 --> 16:20.190
To the death?
 To the death?
What did I miss?

16:20.190 --> 16:23.273
I'll tell you
what you missed,
table four needs waters.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.034
(CROWD CHEERING)

16:36.076 --> 16:39.999
Look, Sebastian,
we don't need to fight
to the death over some girl.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.672
Okay, we can settle this
like men.

16:42.672 --> 16:44.754
We are settling
it like men.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.086
By fighting to the death.

16:48.128 --> 16:50.680
Good luck.
He's never lost.

16:54.054 --> 16:57.187
Uh, Cyd?
It's jumpy time.

16:57.187 --> 16:59.229
I'm trying!
I can't get through.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.773
I'm going to separate
the top of you
from the bottom of you.

17:09.739 --> 17:11.781
Stop running and face me,
you coward!

17:11.781 --> 17:12.952
You know who
wouldn't like this?

17:12.952 --> 17:14.614
Princess Daisy.
We should stop.

17:14.614 --> 17:16.205
We can stop
when you're dead.

17:16.205 --> 17:17.577
I changed my mind,
let's not stop!

17:24.714 --> 17:26.586
What are you doing, wench?

17:26.586 --> 17:28.968
You know we charge double
during sword fights.

17:28.968 --> 17:30.590
Nothing makes a man
want to eat our ribs

17:30.590 --> 17:32.932
like watching someone
else get jabbed in his.

17:34.224 --> 17:36.436
Back to work!
 I quit!

17:36.436 --> 17:38.017
Oww!

17:38.017 --> 17:40.230
There goes
me last toenail!

17:41.941 --> 17:43.233
Get back here!

17:46.856 --> 17:48.818
I timed that wrong.
See, I thought you
were gonna swing it

17:48.818 --> 17:50.069
and I was gonna
jump over it...

17:50.069 --> 17:52.112
Oh, you're gonna
do it now? Okay.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.953
See that's what I was
gonna do before.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.541
(CHUCKLING)

18:04.003 --> 18:05.505
Daisy is mine!

18:08.208 --> 18:09.469
Cyd?

18:09.469 --> 18:11.171
Daisy doesn't belong
to anyone!

18:11.171 --> 18:13.473
This doesn't involve you!

18:13.473 --> 18:15.805
You attack my friend,
you attack me.

18:15.805 --> 18:17.096
Let's do this!

18:33.193 --> 18:34.494
(CACKLING)

18:48.918 --> 18:52.091
Well, it looks like
I successfully
beat your sword

18:52.091 --> 18:53.343
with my sword.

18:55.094 --> 18:58.678
End your engagement to
Princess Daisy
and I'll spare your life.

18:59.349 --> 19:01.561
Fine. You win.

19:01.561 --> 19:03.393
(CROWD CHEERING)

19:04.894 --> 19:07.227
Wow, Cyd, I didn't
know you could do that!

19:07.227 --> 19:08.528
Me neither! It's amazing

19:08.528 --> 19:10.069
what you can do
when you don't want to die

19:10.069 --> 19:11.271
and you're holding a sword.

19:18.117 --> 19:19.579
This isn't over, wench!

19:24.874 --> 19:27.877
Shelbs, you saved me,
that was so cool!

19:28.498 --> 19:29.749
What can I say?

19:29.749 --> 19:31.130
I live the mug life.

19:32.962 --> 19:34.214
And now it's not cool.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.675
You are your
own worst enemy.

19:37.887 --> 19:39.849
Maybe we could have
avoided all this
if we'd just

19:39.849 --> 19:41.391
told Sebastian the truth.

19:41.391 --> 19:43.853
What? That Daisy
was being locked in a tower

19:43.853 --> 19:45.265
and then
a time rift opened

19:45.265 --> 19:48.478
and she time traveled
to the year 2016?

19:48.478 --> 19:50.520
Yeah, he'd never
believe that.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.522
I guess this was
the only way.

19:52.522 --> 19:54.153
Come on, let's jump back
and tell Daisy

19:54.153 --> 19:56.155
she never has to
worry about
this jerk again.

20:02.282 --> 20:05.955
I'm losing ten points
every second
I'm in the penalty rug!

20:05.955 --> 20:08.378
If I don't get out soon,
Daisy's gonna win for sure!

20:10.460 --> 20:12.252
Why'd he roll himself
into the rug?

20:12.252 --> 20:13.713
I don't know.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.295
I don't even know when
it started being
the penalty rug

20:15.295 --> 20:17.096
and stopped being
the cocoon of silence!

20:19.098 --> 20:20.550
What am I going to do?

20:20.550 --> 20:21.891
I don't want any
of his possessions,

20:21.891 --> 20:23.933
but he won't take them
back unless he wins.

20:23.933 --> 20:25.475
Let me talk to him.

20:25.475 --> 20:28.608
(GROANING)

20:28.608 --> 20:33.483
Barry, I thought the plan
was to make up the rules
so you could beat Daisy.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.275
You're playing
like you don't
want to win.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.617
Is it that obvious?
 Is what that obvious?

20:37.617 --> 20:39.819
As usual, Renaldo,
you can see right
through me.

20:41.451 --> 20:44.324
Yes, at first
it was just about
winning my stuff back.

20:44.324 --> 20:47.457
But somewhere between
the video games and
Quarxnox,

20:47.457 --> 20:49.289
it stopped being about that.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.291
I just didn't want
Daisy to leave.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.212
I really like hanging
out with her.

20:53.212 --> 20:55.174
Is that crazy?

20:55.174 --> 20:59.138
Actually, it's the first
not-crazy thing
you've done today.

20:59.138 --> 21:02.302
I suppose this game
has gotten a little
out of hand.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.304
Renaldo, release me
from the penalty rug.

21:11.981 --> 21:14.063
Daisy, there's something
I want to say to you.

21:14.063 --> 21:16.736
There's something
I want to say to you, too.

21:16.736 --> 21:18.778
You're standing
on the bonus button!

21:18.778 --> 21:20.400
Double points. Game over.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.741
You win!

21:21.741 --> 21:23.953
For the love of Quarxnox,
it's finally over!

21:25.705 --> 21:28.498
Your stuff is yours
again, congratulations.

21:31.170 --> 21:32.372
Good news, Daisy!

21:32.372 --> 21:33.913
We ended your
engagement!

21:33.913 --> 21:35.465
Whoa! You're engaged?

21:37.176 --> 21:39.469
Not anymore!
Sebastian's status
went from

21:39.469 --> 21:42.972
"In a Relationship" to
"'Tis Complicated".

21:42.972 --> 21:45.885
You guys are the best!
Thank you so much.

21:45.885 --> 21:47.347
Now you can text
Mike back.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.978
Come on! Let's go see
if he wants to hang out!

21:50.560 --> 21:52.352
Oh, wait, Barry.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.354
What was it you
wanted to tell me?

21:54.354 --> 21:57.196
Uh... Nothing.
It was nothing.

21:57.196 --> 21:59.939
Okay, well, see ya.

22:05.705 --> 22:07.156
You okay?

22:07.156 --> 22:10.450
Yeah. Absolutely.
Sometimes in the heat
of Quarxnox,

22:10.450 --> 22:14.293
feelings emerge that,
upon second thought,
prove best not pursued.

22:14.293 --> 22:15.665
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

22:15.665 --> 22:17.547
Another game
of Sir King's
Knight Quest?

22:17.547 --> 22:20.049
Yep.
Also, you like Daisy.

22:26.386 --> 22:29.389
Daisy, Mike clearly isn't
the guy for you.

22:29.389 --> 22:33.102
He texted "heart sombrero
birthday cake"!

22:33.102 --> 22:36.235
Gross. I'm just gonna
text him turkey leg
and end this.

22:38.237 --> 22:41.320
I can't thank you enough
for breaking up with
Sebastian for me.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.152
He sounds
like a real jerk.

22:43.152 --> 22:45.825
Oh, and sorry about the whole
fight-to-the-death thing.

22:45.825 --> 22:47.987
Probably should have
mentioned that
little custom of ours.

22:47.987 --> 22:50.830
A little heads up
would have been nice.

22:50.830 --> 22:52.872
But the important thing
is you don't have

22:52.872 --> 22:54.584
to worry about Sebastian
anymore.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.803
Daisy? Where is she?

23:07.386 --> 23:09.348
I know you are hiding
the princess in this tower.

23:10.099 --> 23:12.642
She belongs to me,

23:12.642 --> 23:15.274
and I will not
rest until I find her!
