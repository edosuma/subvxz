07:42.709 --> 07:44.291
Come on, punch me.

07:44.375 --> 07:46.583
Come on, like Houdini-- boom.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.208
All right, Jimmy,
I need a urine sample.

07:48.291 --> 07:49.834
I need you to fill this bottle.

07:49.917 --> 07:51.083
From here?

07:51.166 --> 07:53.083
Yeah, in your dreams.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.000
That tickles, doc.
(giggling)

07:55.083 --> 07:58.291
You're not gonna stick
your finger... you know.

07:58.375 --> 08:00.917
Seriously, do not
stick your finger... Ah...

08:01.000 --> 08:02.041
Ah.

08:02.125 --> 08:03.375
(high-pitched):
Ah!

08:03.458 --> 08:06.291
You know, it's
actually not that bad.

08:06.375 --> 08:09.667
Well, that was an extremely
unpleasant 20 minutes.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.250
But I must say,
you are in terrific health.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.000
That's what I keep
telling everybody.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.583
There is one thing. I found
a suspicious mole on your arm.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.667
I'd like to take
a biopsy to check it out.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.041
It's probably nothing,

08:20.125 --> 08:21.625
but it is better
to be safe than sorry.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.333
Sorry about what, exactly?

08:23.417 --> 08:25.625
It could be skin cancer.

08:25.709 --> 08:27.333
There's less than
a two percent chance

08:27.417 --> 08:29.417
that it's anything at all,
but I want to take a sample,

08:29.500 --> 08:31.625
send it off, then I'll call you
tomorrow and let you know.

08:31.709 --> 08:32.959
No, I'm not worried.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.333
I've gone my whole life
without getting a cold.

08:34.417 --> 08:36.333
I'm not gonna stress out
over some splotch on my arm

08:36.417 --> 08:37.917
that has a two percent
chance of being dangerous.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.959
You know who has a two percent
chance of winning an Oscar?

08:40.041 --> 08:42.667
The Rock. You don't see him
out shopping for a tuxedo.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.917
Am I right, doc?
(chuckles)

08:44.000 --> 08:46.333
God, I hate our dynamic.

08:46.417 --> 08:48.417
Back at ya.
Go ahead.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.250
How'd it go?

08:52.333 --> 08:53.500
(laughs) What'd I tell you?

08:53.583 --> 08:55.583
Perfect physical specimen.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.583
How the...

08:57.667 --> 09:00.333
Mmm! So good.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

09:00.417 --> 09:01.750
See? All we had to do

09:01.834 --> 09:03.375
was give her a crazy fun day

09:03.458 --> 09:04.667
and pretend
the surgery doesn't exist.

09:04.750 --> 09:06.583
That's right.
We're having fun.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.750
But not too much fun
that it's suspicious,

09:08.834 --> 09:10.417
like when we fed
my cat Fonzie

09:10.500 --> 09:13.375
an entire salmon filet
right before putting him down

09:13.458 --> 09:15.375
'cause he had feline AIDS.

09:15.458 --> 09:16.375
We're having fun.

09:16.458 --> 09:18.000
I'll just take this
out of your way.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.667
Are you crazy?!

09:19.750 --> 09:21.834
What kind of monster are you?
She's having surgery tomorrow!

09:21.917 --> 09:24.166
She wasn't holding the spoon.
I just thought that maybe...

09:24.250 --> 09:25.875
You didn't think, Cindy.
You didn't think!

09:25.959 --> 09:27.375
You never put a spoon down?

09:27.458 --> 09:29.375
You hold your spoon
the entire time you're eating?

09:29.458 --> 09:30.291
Oh, bravo.

09:30.375 --> 09:32.458
Sometimes I put down my spoon.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.417
Hi.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.375
Maybe she didn't deserve that.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.375
So much for pretending
like nothing's happening.

09:39.458 --> 09:42.375
If you let me
kick you guys out right now,

09:42.458 --> 09:45.500
it's really going to increase my
chances of sleeping with Cindy.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.208
(beeping, trilling)

09:48.291 --> 09:50.125
Damn it!

09:50.208 --> 09:51.667
Come on, it's got to be
somebody's birthday.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.333
But we already tried
all the important ones.

09:53.417 --> 09:55.417
We haven't tried mine.

09:58.917 --> 10:00.667
Thank God.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.000
I would've been like, "Stop
being obsessed with me, bro."

10:03.083 --> 10:05.417
Who does he think he is,
not telling me about his safe?

10:05.500 --> 10:07.500
You know, the guy makes me
do everything for him.

10:07.583 --> 10:09.125
I dump his girlfriends.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.834
I buy the things
he's too embarrassed to buy

10:10.917 --> 10:12.041
at the drugstore,
like fungal cream

10:12.125 --> 10:13.417
and queso dip.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.417
But I don't
get to know about this?

10:15.500 --> 10:17.417
You know what?
Next time I see Jimmy,

10:17.500 --> 10:19.417
I'm gonna say to him,
"Little boy,

10:19.500 --> 10:20.625
you better tell me
what's in this damn s..."

10:20.709 --> 10:22.000
(footsteps approaching)

10:22.083 --> 10:23.333
Hide it!

10:24.500 --> 10:26.458
Hi, boss.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.750
Hi.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.458
I love working for you.

10:29.542 --> 10:32.291
Sara tricked me into going to
the doctor's to get a physical,

10:32.375 --> 10:34.458
and I didn't even get to go
to The Polo House after.

10:34.542 --> 10:35.875
That sucks.
Speaking of,

10:35.959 --> 10:38.041
did you have a pet
when you were little,

10:38.125 --> 10:39.625
and if so, what
was its birthday?

10:39.709 --> 10:41.458
Yeah, a parakeet,
and no idea.

10:42.709 --> 10:46.500
So, doctor found
this spot on my arm,

10:46.583 --> 10:49.458
and apparently there's a two
percent chance it's skin cancer.

10:49.542 --> 10:50.792
It sounds like
they're just being cautious.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.208
Yeah, that's what I said.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.583
I mean, two percent
is very low odds, right?

10:54.667 --> 10:56.458
Then again,
so were the odds of me

10:56.542 --> 10:57.959
opening a successful
restaurant.

10:58.041 --> 11:00.333
A-And finding out that
I had a son and a granddaughter

11:00.417 --> 11:01.709
I didn't know about.
Oh, my God.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.458
I've been defying the odds
my whole life.

11:03.542 --> 11:05.458
And The Rock-- he was
very good in<i> San Andreas. </i>

11:05.542 --> 11:07.667
I could see him getting
some award show love.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.375
Mario-- remember Mario,
our old butcher?

11:09.458 --> 11:11.500
He had a suspicious mole.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.500
I'm gonna call him at his shop
and see how he's doing.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.834
Hey, hi, this is Jimmy Martino.
Is Mario there?

11:16.917 --> 11:18.250
Oh, okay, thanks.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.500
Mario's dead.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.166
I need to calm down.

11:21.250 --> 11:22.750
Don't look up
moles online.

11:22.834 --> 11:26.500
You cannot handle that much
uncensored information.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.500
Hey, you know what
you forgot to say?

11:28.583 --> 11:31.166
All those things that you said
you were gonna tell Jimmy

11:31.250 --> 11:33.083
right before he came in.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.208
What's not fine is
him having a secret safe

13:55.291 --> 13:57.542
and not telling me about it.
It's disrespectful.

13:57.625 --> 13:59.041
It's an outrage,
is what it is.

13:59.125 --> 14:01.792
It makes me feel less than,
which is not a good feeling.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.083
He did this to himself.

14:06.917 --> 14:08.625
(chuckles)
Cool.

14:08.709 --> 14:09.625
Hey, guys.

14:09.709 --> 14:11.458
You did not see anything.

14:11.542 --> 14:13.875
Yes, I did.

14:13.959 --> 14:16.166
We are amazing. We can get
our daughter through anything.

14:16.250 --> 14:19.041
I almost can't wait till the
next bad thing happens to her.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.375
Too much.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.166
What the hell
are they doing?

14:22.250 --> 14:24.625
They don't want Edie
to know they're scared,

14:24.709 --> 14:28.375
so they keep taking little
breaks to pump each other up.

14:28.458 --> 14:31.041
Weirdos.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.750
I wanted to tell you...
thank you

14:33.834 --> 14:35.083
for going to
the doctor.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.500
It means a lot
to Gerald.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.500
And it meant a lot to me.

14:38.583 --> 14:40.834
That I was able
to trick you into going

14:40.917 --> 14:41.917
so easily.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.083
You are a simple, simple man.

SARA:
Watch this. (gasps)

14:50.166 --> 14:51.917
You did it. Oh, no. Not yet. Oh.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.709
(Edie babbles)

14:53.792 --> 14:57.000
Hey, I know it's scary,
but she's gonna be fine.

14:57.083 --> 14:58.583
There's, like,
a two percent chance

14:58.667 --> 15:01.458
that there could be
any kind of complication.

15:01.542 --> 15:03.083
Two percent.

(loud clang)

16:30.750 --> 16:32.750
This was
incredibly stupid.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.917
Yeah.
What were we thinking?

16:35.959 --> 16:37.625
Ready?

16:37.709 --> 16:40.250
I think that deli's 24 hours.
People keep walking in and out.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.417
(cell phone ringing)

16:41.500 --> 16:42.667
Hang on.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.208
(grunting)

16:45.291 --> 16:46.458
Hello?

16:46.542 --> 16:48.458
Annelise, do you
know where Jimmy is?

16:48.542 --> 16:51.667
He isn't answering his phone.
And he came here, he took Edie,

16:51.750 --> 16:53.667
he left this crazy note...

16:53.750 --> 16:56.125
I bet he looked his mole up
on the Internet.

16:56.208 --> 16:57.667
I think I know
where he is.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.667
The roof of that hardware store
on Melrose and Vine.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.000
Why would he be there?

17:01.083 --> 17:03.417
Just trust me.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.834
We definitely should have paid
more attention to him earlier.

17:05.917 --> 17:08.083
I think we know
what we got to do.
Yep.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.834
But I'm gonna wait for
you to say it first.

17:09.917 --> 17:11.542
So I don't sound stupid
in case I'm wrong.

17:11.625 --> 17:14.667
Get the safe back in the wall
and go apologize to Jimmy.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.667
Yep, I was wrong.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.667
I'm not letting you get
those tubes in your ears.

17:18.750 --> 17:20.667
I saw some things on
the Internet, sister,

17:20.750 --> 17:22.834
that you do not
want to see.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.375
I also saw some
pretty great things, too.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.709
Are you hip to Suspicious Mole?

17:26.792 --> 17:29.500
Very well done. Hey.

17:29.583 --> 17:32.041
Look, I'm not letting you near
that doctor, no matter what.

17:32.125 --> 17:34.542
Even if it's the last thing
I do. Which it...

17:34.625 --> 17:37.041
may well be.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.375
You like it up here?

17:41.458 --> 17:43.000
This place used to be Zanini's.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.834
It was the first restaurant
I ever worked at.

17:44.917 --> 17:46.333
And when I got stressed out,

17:46.417 --> 17:48.208
I used to come up on
this roof and just...

17:48.291 --> 17:50.291
(exhales)

17:52.291 --> 17:54.625
Kind of ugly though,
and it smells,

17:54.709 --> 17:55.917
but I like it.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Sort of like Mr. Zanini, really.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.417
I know you have to get
that surgery, but...

18:05.500 --> 18:08.625
I'm just scared.

18:08.709 --> 18:10.625
I'm not used to
worrying about people.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.500
But you're gonna
be okay, right?

18:12.583 --> 18:13.792
(babbling)

18:13.875 --> 18:16.667
I'm probably gonna
be okay, too.

18:16.750 --> 18:17.959
I know what you're thinking.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.750
How do I go 20 years
without seeing a doctor?

18:20.834 --> 18:23.291
I guess I just...
I didn't think about it.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.625
I mean, it's easy
not to think about if...

18:25.709 --> 18:27.500
you don't have people
in your life

18:27.583 --> 18:30.500
that care whether you go or not.

18:30.583 --> 18:34.333
But now that I have all you
clinging, annoying people,

18:34.417 --> 18:37.375
I don't want to
miss out on that.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.333
Now that I have it.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.834
You know what
I mean? Huh?

18:41.917 --> 18:43.959
Does it smell up here?

18:44.041 --> 18:45.792
I think I need
a new spot.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.792
GERALD:
What are you doing here?!

18:47.875 --> 18:49.000
Our daughter went to bed

18:49.083 --> 18:50.875
in the perfect mental
mindset for surgery.

18:50.959 --> 18:52.875
And then you stole her
and took her to the roof

18:52.959 --> 18:54.083
of a hardware store?

18:54.166 --> 18:55.208
What the hell?

18:56.875 --> 18:59.125
The doctor the other day
found a spot on my arm.

18:59.208 --> 19:02.166
There's a 98% chance
it's nothing, but...

19:02.250 --> 19:05.083
I just got all worked
up about everything.

19:05.166 --> 19:06.792
Why didn't you just
tell us the truth?

19:06.875 --> 19:08.792
Because you're annoying.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.291
And...

19:11.375 --> 19:12.959
That's it. You're just annoying.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.625
Sounded like
you were gonna say more.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.000
I'm the strong, silent type.

19:17.083 --> 19:19.166
Can we go? Uh, it's
horrible up here.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.792
Hey. You're gonna be fine,
all right?

19:21.875 --> 19:24.291
SARA: Yeah, he will be.
He stole a baby

19:24.375 --> 19:26.166
and took her
to the wishing roof.

19:26.250 --> 19:29.125
There you are.
I knew you'd be here.
What?

19:29.208 --> 19:30.917
This is his spot.
He used to work here.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.834
And when Frank Sinatra would
come in, he'd get so nervous...

19:33.917 --> 19:36.834
Oh, my God. Frank Sinatra.

19:36.917 --> 19:38.458
We came to support you!

19:42.125 --> 19:44.834
Aw. Look at you.
You're such a champ.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.834
She's not even crying.
I bet most babies would
be crying right now.

19:46.917 --> 19:48.375
She's too tired to cry.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.625
She's been up since 4:00
because you stole her.

19:50.709 --> 19:52.667
(cell phone ringing)

19:52.750 --> 19:54.000
Is that...

19:56.000 --> 19:57.750
Hi, Dr. Melvoy.

19:57.834 --> 19:59.834
Yes.

19:59.917 --> 20:01.333
Okay. Thank you.

20:01.417 --> 20:02.625
I... Yes, I understand.

20:02.709 --> 20:04.917
Thank you. Bye.

20:05.917 --> 20:07.917
Not cancer.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.208
(chuckles)

20:10.291 --> 20:11.875
if I want a referral
to another doctor.

20:11.959 --> 20:13.625
He didn't think
we were a good match.

20:13.709 --> 20:14.875
I thought
he had fat fingers anyway.

20:14.959 --> 20:16.792
Uh...

20:16.875 --> 20:18.500
This was such a nice moment.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.959
(beeping)

20:22.959 --> 20:24.834
(both chuckle)

20:24.917 --> 20:26.000
Huh.

20:26.083 --> 20:28.250
What's this?

20:30.250 --> 20:32.458
Fancy hand cream?

20:32.542 --> 20:34.875
Velvet Gent?

20:34.959 --> 20:37.875
"Velvet Gent is a discontinued
men's hand cream from the '90s

20:37.959 --> 20:40.041
known for its masculine scent of
leather, wood and lemongrass."

20:40.125 --> 20:42.750
Jimmy's hands do smell
like that.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.250
Well, you kiss the ring,
you're gonna smell the hand.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.250
(scoffs)

20:45.333 --> 20:47.333
Let's try it.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.291
(both inhale deeply)

20:53.375 --> 20:55.917
(both exhale)

20:56.000 --> 20:58.083
I don't know
what I thought would happen.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.166
Let's get back to work.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.834
Stupid painting.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.417
Hey, boss.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.917
Looking good.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.959
What smells like wood,
leather and lemongrass?

21:12.041 --> 21:15.917
Oh. I was chopping wood with
leather gloves this morning.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
RAVI:
Yeah, and I was...

21:17.083 --> 21:18.291
chopping some lemongrass.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.917
So there you go.
All three smells.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.917
Oh. Well, I have some hand cream
that smells like that.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.083
It's in my safe
behind the picture over there.

21:24.166 --> 21:25.417
You guys are welcome
to it anytime.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.417
The combination is
Frank Sinatra's birthday.
