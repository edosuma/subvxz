<i>What do you think happens
if you dump hundreds of kilos</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:15.320

JULY 2001

00:38.720 --> 00:40.960
Eduardo! Eduardo!

00:46.200 --> 00:48.800
While we're distracted
buying all this shit we don't need,

00:48.800 --> 00:50.760
- those in power do whatever they want.
- Rafael.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.920
- You're a fucking nutjob.
- No, I know what I'm saying.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.120
- It's just a movie.
<i>- The Matrix</i> isn't just a movie.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.320
Eduardo! The priest started bleeding
from his nose

00:58.320 --> 00:59.800
and passed out during mass.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.280
Fucking hell.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.880
<i>My boy Eduardo.</i>

01:07.880 --> 01:10.200
<i>I could say that the story
started at this moment,</i>

01:10.200 --> 01:11.720
<i>with our boy shitting himself,</i>

01:12.400 --> 01:15.040
<i>or go a little back
and talk about a strange place</i>

01:15.040 --> 01:16.920

<i>Centuries of poverty, isolation,</i>

01:32.360 --> 01:35.160
<i>storms, volcanoes, earthquakes.</i>

01:35.160 --> 01:36.560
<i>We've got it all, baby.</i>

01:36.560 --> 01:39.520
<i>But we are people who don't let fear
get the better of us.</i>

01:39.520 --> 01:41.800
Run faster, you moron!
Always late.

01:41.800 --> 01:42.880
All dicks on deck!

01:42.880 --> 01:44.520
All right.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.160
Hey, brother.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.080
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.040
Awesome, man.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.640
All right?

02:15.280 --> 02:19.200
Remove Poborsky, Nuno Gomes and Maniche,
Benfica isn't much of a team.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.960
If you keep removing everybody,
it won't be.

02:20.960 --> 02:21.920
Ah!

02:23.800 --> 02:26.480
- I'd like to see those guys here.
- Right?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.960
Yeah, like Maniche pouring the bait.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.280
You know? Nuno Gomes sewing the nets.
Wouldn't you like it?

02:30.280 --> 02:32.680
Oh, look, I played
against Nuno Gomes in the youth league.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.720
I didn't let him have
any attempt at a goal.

02:34.720 --> 02:35.920
But weren't you a forward?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.840
I thought our little lady here
only knew about ice skating, huh?

02:38.840 --> 02:40.960
- Shut up, I'll throw you overboard!
- What the fuck?

02:40.960 --> 02:44.040
- Stop fucking taunting Carlinhos!
- Why are you always defending him?

02:44.040 --> 02:46.000
I'm not.
But you should be watching the weather.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.160
He's my guardian angel. Don't you know?

02:48.160 --> 02:50.760
- He's got my back. You're just jealous.
- I'm not jealous, prick.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.440
- You're jealous!
- Stop it, you stupid ass!

02:52.440 --> 02:54.920
Rafael, turn the boat around.
A storm is coming.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.000
- Only when my knee warns me.
- Your what?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Only when my knee warns me, I said.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.360
If I wait for your meniscus,
we'll end up soaked.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.040
Come on, you moron. Let's get out of here.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.560
Let's go.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.040
- Fuck! Watch out, my knee, my knee.
- Your knee's fine, you baby.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.240
- Yeah, well, now it's warning me.
- Come on, jump.

03:44.960 --> 03:45.960
Fuck this.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.920
- Fishing went well?
- We hardly caught anything.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.760
- Mmm.
- But at least we have dinner.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.000
Right?

04:04.440 --> 04:05.720
What's that on your face?

04:05.720 --> 04:07.800
Would I go into town
without cleaning myself up?

04:09.320 --> 04:10.200
Wait a second.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.720
Hold still.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.640
Wait.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.600
Thanks. It's nothing.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.080
It's fine.

04:18.080 --> 04:20.280
All right, enough.

04:20.280 --> 04:22.000
- Look at me.
- It's good.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.720
You need to fill in this form
and then you hand it to us

04:25.720 --> 04:27.200

the man or the woman?"

04:38.640 --> 04:39.880
What is this shit?

04:41.800 --> 04:42.680
Fuck this.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.240
Hello!

04:45.240 --> 04:46.680
Okay!

04:46.680 --> 04:48.880
Hey! You look so cute!

04:48.880 --> 04:50.440
You don't notice anything?

04:50.440 --> 04:52.240
- They look super cute.
- Bangs, nice.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.520
It looks good on you.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.440
- Hold on.
- What's up?

04:56.240 --> 04:58.120
I was before you two.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.480
Oh, no, I was already here,
saving their spot in line.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.680
Yeah, but that's not how it works.
We're waiting.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.480
No offense, I couldn't care less.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.200
Let's see, um...

05:22.240 --> 05:23.880
YOUR NUMBER

05:23.880 --> 05:27.000
CONSULTING ROOMS 1-6
PLEASE TAKE A NUMBER AND WAIT

05:27.000 --> 05:30.760
<i>Dr. Menezes,
to the ER. Dr. Menezes, to the ER, stat.</i>

05:37.160 --> 05:39.480
I'm just gonna go
to the bathroom, all right?

05:39.480 --> 05:40.560
Stay here.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.440
I'm sorry, Eduardo.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.920
Had you finished high school,

06:22.920 --> 06:25.960
maybe there might have been a chance
that the visa would have been approved,

06:25.960 --> 06:28.360
but, um, as of now,
there's nothing we can do.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.480
- Okay.
- You-- You can reapply in six months.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.800
No, it's okay.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.080
<i>There are so many Azoreans
in America</i>

06:34.080 --> 06:37.680
<i>that the East Coast is known
as a tenth island of the archipelago.</i>

06:37.680 --> 06:40.920
<i>They say that Azoreans are wired
to be world travelers.</i>

06:40.920 --> 06:42.920
<i>Fuck! Bullshit!</i>

06:42.920 --> 06:45.080
<i>We just want to escape good old poverty.</i>

07:06.320 --> 07:09.160
Hi. Jeremias Melo. He's my father.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.360
- It's for eye surgery.
- Sir, I'm afraid you're late.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.400
I know, it's only a few numbers.
I was 53, so--

07:16.400 --> 07:18.400
It's not just a few numbers.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.640
You're a day late for your appointment.

07:21.560 --> 07:25.280
But here, in the letter, it reads
5th of June 2001, which is today.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.920
- The system says that it was yesterday.
- But in the letter, it says it's today.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.720
I don't know.
It's because someone made a mistake.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.040
But I'm not the one
who made the mistake here.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.600
Number fifty-six?

07:41.240 --> 07:44.040
- I appreciate your help, lady.
- Fifty-six.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.880
Fifty-six!

08:03.080 --> 08:05.280
<i>Had you finished
high school, maybe...</i>

08:09.480 --> 08:11.000
<i>...as of now, there's nothing we can do.</i>

08:19.560 --> 08:21.880
Are you going
to smoke that on your own?

08:22.640 --> 08:24.400
We don't want to trigger the alarm.

08:34.120 --> 08:34.960
I'm Bruna.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.040
- Sílvia.
- So...

08:40.040 --> 08:41.280
what happened in there?

08:46.320 --> 08:47.400
It's my photos.

08:48.520 --> 08:49.640
They're terrible.

08:50.920 --> 08:51.760
Let me see.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.120
I know.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.040
Yeah.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.240
Those are pretty bad.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.160
They don't do you justice.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.840
You have way more style
than all those girls put together.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.600
Got a pen I can use?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.600
I have a-- a friend. Boyfriend.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.840
He's a fashion photographer.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.400
How do you think I'm gonna pay
a professional photographer, hmm?

09:21.400 --> 09:24.600
Take this, tell him I recommended you.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.840
I can't cut my hair though!

09:29.840 --> 09:31.920
- No.
- It'll come off with water.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.760
Are you serious?
It doesn't work!

09:33.760 --> 09:36.640
- What's your great idea?
- God, how can I get it out?

09:36.640 --> 09:38.560
- I can't cut it!
- You don't have to.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.280
Come on, put it in. Go on.
Maybe I was wrong, try the water.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.480
I'm sorry about the mix-up
at the hospital.

09:45.320 --> 09:48.560
If I didn't get my operation,
God must have his reasons.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.400
Hey. It's okay, son. You'll make it right.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.000
Yeah.

09:58.160 --> 10:01.920
HOPE

10:16.000 --> 10:17.920
For fuck's sake,
what's going on?

10:17.920 --> 10:20.440
What is this sea?
Where did we end up?

10:22.600 --> 10:24.200
Gianluca!

10:32.480 --> 10:34.200
Gianluca!

10:34.960 --> 10:37.760
Gianluca! Damn!

10:38.880 --> 10:40.080
Shit!

10:40.080 --> 10:42.440
Gianluca, move your ass!

10:46.400 --> 10:47.800
What happened?

10:47.800 --> 10:50.960
The rudder broke!

10:54.320 --> 10:55.920
Where are we?

10:57.720 --> 11:00.720
I don't know!
The middle of nowhere!

11:04.840 --> 11:08.160
<i>And here was exactly
where it all began.</i>

11:08.160 --> 11:10.680
<i>With Italian mafiosi
that crossed the Atlantic</i>

11:10.680 --> 11:13.160
<i>in a sailing ship loaded with drugs.</i>

11:24.920 --> 11:28.840
It's the coil. I warned you.
We should have taken the bus.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.680
- Really? Of all the fucking days.
- Hey.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.280
Watch your mouth.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.080
Do you know if...

13:02.680 --> 13:03.520
Huh?

13:04.440 --> 13:07.440
Have any new movies arrived?
These ones have been the same for weeks.

13:07.440 --> 13:10.760
And when did anything new arrive
in this miserable place? Hmm?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.040
CRIME

13:29.040 --> 13:30.680
And how did it go in the city?

13:37.680 --> 13:40.640
You can't put up with those people
without smoking a bowl.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.720
And who exactly is that?

13:44.560 --> 13:46.280
The other chicks.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.640
My rivals.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.040
You've got rivals?

14:05.240 --> 14:07.760
I mean, have you ever seen
a Miss Rabo de Peixe?

14:12.040 --> 14:13.200
I just wanted the prize.

14:15.200 --> 14:20.000
A trip to Boston, for two people,
including the hotel.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.440
Nothing good ever happens here.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.680
Who would you take with you to America?

14:30.680 --> 14:31.640
No one.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.760
I would go alone.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.440
This one, please.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.800
Well, I'm closing. I'm out.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.200
Have you got an answer
about your visa to America?

15:08.920 --> 15:10.080
No, not yet.

15:12.280 --> 15:15.960
It's better this way,
while my dad waits for his procedure.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.680
Since when does an Azorean
need a visa to go to America, moron?

15:18.680 --> 15:20.080
Hmm?

15:20.080 --> 15:21.120
You just go.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.320
It's like I said.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.840
- In this shithole--
- Nothing good ever happens.

15:29.080 --> 15:29.960
I know.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.680
Mayday, mayday!

15:44.320 --> 15:46.000
Can anyone hear me?

15:48.320 --> 15:50.120
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

15:50.120 --> 15:52.440
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck?

15:52.440 --> 15:56.280
Don't you know
we can't ask for help? Asshole!

15:57.760 --> 15:59.160
Let's go this way.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.760
Go fuck yourself!

16:11.320 --> 16:13.200
We have to dock!

16:13.200 --> 16:15.080
You're out of your mind.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.680
You want to dock
with a boat full of drugs?

16:18.640 --> 16:21.040
We have
to throw it overboard!

16:21.040 --> 16:22.920
I don't want to sink!

16:25.800 --> 16:28.360
Try it and you'll be the one
who ends up in the sea.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.000
I don't want to drown!

16:34.120 --> 16:35.320
The cocaine!

16:35.320 --> 16:38.600
If the drugs end up
in the sea, we'll die on land!

16:38.600 --> 16:40.960
Do you fucking understand?
Yes or no?

16:50.280 --> 16:51.320
Gianluca!

16:53.160 --> 16:55.800
Land! Land ahoy!

18:43.040 --> 18:44.200
Hey, brother.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.560
If I had the money,
I would lend you some, you know that.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.600
Yeah, but I can't be
without a car, Rafael.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.400
Want to go out to sea today?

18:53.400 --> 18:56.160
If it's a Friday, you know damn well
I'm not getting on a boat.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.840
Look, I'm gonna deliver this shit.
If you want to, come with me,

19:01.840 --> 19:03.760
and we'll split the money.
It's all I can do.

19:03.760 --> 19:07.400
-"This shit," man? What is "this shit"?
- Car radios from America.

19:08.680 --> 19:09.520
Rafael.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.920
Oh, Eduardo, if you want to, fine.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.720
If you don't want to, fine.
It's up to you.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.080
Leave, get out.

19:15.720 --> 19:16.560
Go.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.800
Don't even think about it.
Get out. Move it!

19:19.800 --> 19:21.400
- Rafael, come on.
- Baby, for real.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.600
- Mmm. Come on, leave.
- Oh, fuck this.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.560
You're so beautiful.
Thanks, babe.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.880
Hey, boys!

19:42.880 --> 19:45.520
Oh, look at the star!

19:45.520 --> 19:47.480
Hey, buddy.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.480
Take this. Gimme your fucking autograph.
It's for one of my clients.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.320
Here, here.
Let me see what you brought me.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.200
Hello, beautiful.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.480
Ferrugem, here.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.800
You can smell, but don't taste.
That shit isn't for the likes of you.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.400
This is lovely.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.800
Marvelous. Heads up!

20:05.040 --> 20:06.720
So, a little shot or what?

20:06.720 --> 20:08.520
No, we haven't had breakfast yet.

20:08.520 --> 20:10.480
Oh, you haven't had
your breakfast yet?

20:10.480 --> 20:11.880
- Not yet.
- Ooh!

20:12.760 --> 20:16.800
Next time, bring me a pound.
We have to take advantage of the new law.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.160
- Ah!
- What law?

20:20.200 --> 20:23.480
Fuck!
You watch the news, hmm?

20:23.480 --> 20:25.840
They're going
to legalize drugs.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.680
Our business is gonna grow!

20:31.120 --> 20:33.480
Your payment. This is for the hashish.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.720
- Hmm?
- And this is for you to give to my girl.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.600
You listening? Tell her it was me
who gave it to you to buy her a gift.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.520
Sure thing, boss.

20:41.520 --> 20:42.440
Great.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.040
And this pretty thing. Azores cattle dog.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.800
Come, come here. Lovely.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.640
Ooh, you pretty thing. Oh, good girl.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.040
So lovely. Who owns this dog, you?

20:54.040 --> 20:55.440
She's mine, yeah.

20:55.440 --> 20:58.680
Fuck, man, I really love these animals.
You know, they're so pretty.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.640
Man, I swear.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.400
No one is gonna legalize drugs.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.520
You're gonna be able to walk around
in the street smoking a joint,

21:06.520 --> 21:09.440
but if you're caught with one
of those bricks, you'll all go to jail.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.040
Oh, my! This one thinks he's a lawyer.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.600
Hey, Mr. Lawyer,
this bitch isn't going anywhere.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.360
She'll only leave after mating
with an Azores cattle dog.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.840
Come on, boss,
give him his dog back.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.360
I'm not giving it.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.080
- Give her back to me!
- Whoa!

21:26.080 --> 21:28.680
- Hey! Whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey!

21:28.680 --> 21:30.400
Fucking calm down!

21:30.400 --> 21:31.360
Boss, don't.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.520
If it wasn't...

21:34.880 --> 21:36.480
for your fucking buddy there...

21:38.120 --> 21:39.800
I'd fuck your mouth, you son of a bitch.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.760
You better get the fuck out of here!

21:41.760 --> 21:44.160
- Hey! Get the hell out of here!
- I'll fuck you up!

21:44.160 --> 21:45.160
Boss, don't.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.400
I'm fine with you, champ,

21:46.400 --> 21:48.280
but this fucking poser
better get the fuck out.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.680
Come on.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.880
You needed the money, didn't you?
You got it now.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.840
- You'd rather spend ten hours on a boat?
- Rafael, I just lost my dog.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.360
That motherfucker.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.760
Well, that motherfucker
gave me this to buy you a present.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.000
You should be more grateful to your dad.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.920
Why do you insist
on calling Arruda my dad, huh?

22:07.920 --> 22:09.720
- Fuck off, Rafael.
- He's your dad!

22:09.720 --> 22:11.760
Shut up. Eduardo?

22:16.640 --> 22:18.640
We're gonna find a way
to bring Sky back, hmm?

22:20.880 --> 22:22.920
- Promise, bro.
- Up yours.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.440
Come on! I didn't do it.

22:25.560 --> 22:26.680
Is this my fault?

22:28.480 --> 22:31.080
Mmm, my flower. Fuck yeah.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.520
Oh! Hands on the wheel, you moron.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.200
<i>They say that this place
is called Rabo de Peixe</i>

22:38.200 --> 22:40.080
<i>because the residents were so poor</i>

22:40.080 --> 22:42.520
<i>that they sold the best parts
of whatever they caught,</i>

22:42.520 --> 22:44.760
<i>and only ate the fish tails with bones.</i>

22:45.760 --> 22:48.280
<i>If Rabo de Peixe
was featured on television,</i>

22:48.280 --> 22:51.080
<i>they would portray us
as third-class citizens.</i>

22:52.640 --> 22:55.200
<i>But that was about to change.</i>

22:57.000 --> 22:57.920
<i>Big time.</i>

23:30.440 --> 23:32.760
<i>Jesus Christ almighty,</i>

23:33.440 --> 23:36.120
<i>fuck me if you're not taking the piss
out of the poor.</i>

24:11.200 --> 24:14.640
Oh, here's our coffee!
Thank you, ma'am.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.560
What did the mechanic say?

24:19.560 --> 24:22.280
What did he say?
He's waiting for a part for the rudder.

24:22.280 --> 24:25.120
Tomorrow, we recover
the cargo, set sail, and go home.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.360
People like you
who put that shit in their coffee

24:39.360 --> 24:41.360
should be put in jail.

24:41.360 --> 24:45.720
We crossed the Atlantic
in a sailboat full of drugs,

24:45.720 --> 24:47.240
and that's no problem.

24:47.240 --> 24:50.000
But I put sweetener
in my coffee, and you lose it.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.320
Oh! Don't confuse
illegal with immoral.

24:53.320 --> 24:58.320
Look, some things are sacred.
Fresh water, good wine, a tight pussy...

25:00.160 --> 25:01.880
...and a hard dick.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.720
And coffee
without rat poison.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.000
Francesco, we're fucked.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.920
Fucking hell.

25:29.480 --> 25:30.360
Hey, hey!

25:31.520 --> 25:32.840
Do you have a knife?

25:38.480 --> 25:39.360
Here.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.600
This is cocaine.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.680
No calls on my lunch hour!

26:15.280 --> 26:16.960
Judiciary Police. Good afternoon.

26:21.080 --> 26:21.960
What?

26:21.960 --> 26:23.840
<i>This is breaking news.</i>

26:23.840 --> 26:27.000
<i>Dozens of pounds of cocaine
turned up this afternoon</i>

26:27.000 --> 26:30.120
<i>at various points
on the north coast of São Miguel.</i>

26:30.120 --> 26:32.960
<i>There is still an ongoing police operation</i>

26:32.960 --> 26:36.840
<i>that could result in the biggest seizure
ever in the archipelago.</i>

26:36.840 --> 26:38.320
Be careful, it's bitter.

26:43.080 --> 26:46.080
<i>Some say
the cocaine stories are exaggerated.</i>

26:46.640 --> 26:49.240
<i>It isn't all true,
but I'm sure of one thing.</i>

26:49.240 --> 26:52.200
<i>It was the first time
that it snowed in the Azores.</i>

26:53.960 --> 26:56.280
<i>So far,
the Judiciary Police</i>

26:56.280 --> 26:59.160
<i>have weighed in 326 pounds</i>

26:59.160 --> 27:03.080
<i>seized in Bretanha, Porto Formoso,
and, above all, Rabo de Peixe.</i>

27:03.080 --> 27:05.160
<i>The local authorities...</i>

27:05.160 --> 27:07.400
Dad? Dad, Dad, Dad! What are you doing?

27:07.400 --> 27:09.960
I already told you to ask for my help.
You were seven feet away--

27:09.960 --> 27:11.920
I don't need help to piss, okay?
I'm not a child.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.520
Everything's all right.
It's all right.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.520
- You should have a bath, okay?
- Have a bath?

27:18.520 --> 27:21.280
- Get out, come on. I'll clean it up.
- Yeah, I know what I have to do.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.440
<i>What is the estimated worth
of this seizure?</i>

27:23.440 --> 27:26.320
<i>This is,
um, a record seizure,</i>

27:26.320 --> 27:27.760
<i>of nine million euros.</i>

27:27.760 --> 27:31.800
<i>Um, since the market value
is 27,000 euros per kilo,</i>

27:31.800 --> 27:35.480
<i>it's an unprecedented seizure
here in São Miguel.</i>

27:35.480 --> 27:37.200
<i>Thank you very much, detective.</i>

27:38.560 --> 27:41.080
<i>Those were the statements
of Detective Banha.</i>

27:41.080 --> 27:43.160
<i>We will obviously stay here...</i>

27:43.160 --> 27:45.800
<i>...following this police operation,
and keep you up to date</i>

27:45.800 --> 27:47.240
<i>with this developing story.</i>

27:51.240 --> 27:52.600
CHIEF OF POLICE

27:52.600 --> 27:54.240
- Yes?
-<i>Detective Frias?</i>

27:54.240 --> 27:56.600
- Hello, Director.
<i>- We have a situation in the Azores.</i>

27:56.600 --> 27:59.280
- I saw the news.
<i>- Drop whatever you're doing.</i>

27:59.280 --> 28:01.440
<i>There's a ticket
waiting for you at the airport.</i>

28:35.040 --> 28:36.000
Fucking shit.

28:43.960 --> 28:44.960
Whoo-hoo!

28:47.240 --> 28:48.680
Whoo-hoo!

28:48.680 --> 28:50.400
Carlinhos, Sílvia is in back?

28:50.400 --> 28:51.800
Yeah, she is.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.600
But she's with Rafael.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.360
Don't you know that shit
shrivels your dick, Carlinhos?

29:12.360 --> 29:13.720
Hey?

29:14.280 --> 29:15.320
Listen to me.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.120
<i>Boogie Nights?</i>
Have you ever seen <i>Boogie Nights</i>?

29:18.120 --> 29:19.640
- Boogie.
-"Coke dick," it's a thing.

29:19.640 --> 29:22.600
You snort too much of that shit,
and your dick goes perma-soft.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.560
- Does that really happen?
- Of course, it happens.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.280
Do you have any idea
how much this shit's worth? Huh?

29:27.280 --> 29:28.880
- 27,000 euros.
- 27,000?

29:28.880 --> 29:30.600
- Per pound.
- How much is that in escudos?

29:30.600 --> 29:31.920
That's 54 million.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.480
54 million! Oh, my God! With that kind
of cash, I'd buy my mom a mansion.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.440
Listen, Carlinhos,
instead of snorting it all,

29:37.440 --> 29:39.840
it's an opportunity to change our lives.

29:39.840 --> 29:41.800
Hello, my brother!

29:44.200 --> 29:45.560
Give me a fucking hug, man.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.480
Come on, join us. With some, you know--

29:54.560 --> 29:56.920
There's plenty more
floating around out there, Rafael.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.240
We can find it if we go now.
It washed up with the current.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.280
How it got here,
from where, it doesn't matter.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.240
What matters is it's here now with us!

30:06.400 --> 30:08.720
Okay, fine!

30:12.480 --> 30:14.720
- What the fuck?
- Motherfucker.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.160
Eduardo!

30:18.600 --> 30:19.520
Hey, Eduardo!

30:20.640 --> 30:22.080
Eduardo?

30:27.320 --> 30:28.360
Will you be okay?

30:28.960 --> 30:29.800
Yeah.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.440
You know, if there's anyone
who understands impossible love--

30:33.440 --> 30:35.160
Carlinhos,
I don't want to talk about this.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.960
- I don't give a shit about that, man.
- What?

30:36.960 --> 30:39.680
I just want them to be happy,
the rest doesn't matter.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.400
I have more important stuff
to worry about.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.640
You think you can fool me? Huh?

30:53.360 --> 30:54.440
Mmm.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.400
- Thanks, brother.
- Mmm.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.400
All right.

31:02.200 --> 31:05.560
Now, I, um, have to go
and take care of something.

31:07.720 --> 31:08.920
But be careful, huh?

31:09.960 --> 31:10.800
With the coke dick.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.400
<i>In the 15th century,</i>

31:26.400 --> 31:29.040
<i>Spain and Portugal
divided the planet in two.</i>

31:29.560 --> 31:31.640
<i>But before he signed the treaty,</i>

31:31.640 --> 31:33.560
<i>the cunning Portuguese king</i>

31:33.560 --> 31:38.280
<i>demanded that the dividing line
be moved a few hundred miles to the west.</i>

31:38.280 --> 31:39.880
<i>Six years later,</i>

31:39.880 --> 31:43.080
<i>those miles allowed
the Portuguese to have Brazil.</i>

31:43.680 --> 31:44.800
<i>Coincidence?</i>

31:48.400 --> 31:51.120
<i>Being the strongest
isn't always the most important thing.</i>

31:51.120 --> 31:55.360
<i>Sometimes, all we need is to know
something before anybody else.</i>

31:55.360 --> 31:58.720
<i>My boy Eduardo recognized
that whatever was washing up on the beach</i>

31:58.720 --> 32:00.120
<i>had to come from somewhere.</i>

32:00.120 --> 32:02.440
<i>All he had to do was follow the currents.</i>

33:05.280 --> 33:07.240
I want my dog back.

33:08.360 --> 33:09.480
Oh, really?

33:10.160 --> 33:11.680
And a two-handed hand job, as well?

33:11.680 --> 33:13.080
This should be enough.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.520
Hey, hey!

33:16.520 --> 33:19.080
- Sky.
- This is the coke that washed up ashore?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.240
How are you, girl?

33:22.840 --> 33:23.800
Hey, I'm here now.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.720
Dear God of miracles.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.480
We're even now, right?

33:53.960 --> 33:55.240
Hey, hey!

33:55.240 --> 33:58.160
We're even when I say we are, little boy.

34:04.520 --> 34:07.480
Fuck.

34:27.240 --> 34:28.400
Shall we do the countdown?

34:30.400 --> 34:32.280
Come on. Three,

34:32.880 --> 34:33.920
two,

34:33.920 --> 34:35.280
one.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.800
All right, let's go, my girl.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.400
Whoo!

34:45.400 --> 34:47.760
Hey!

35:03.960 --> 35:04.840
Hey, hey.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.920
This is worse
than that sweetener shit

35:14.920 --> 35:16.800
you put in your coffee, believe me.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.880
No, Francesco,
this is worse than cancer of the balls.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.040
Your mother's pussy!

35:53.560 --> 35:55.560
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it.

35:57.680 --> 35:58.880
How much?

36:00.040 --> 36:01.640
How many? How much do you have?

36:01.640 --> 36:04.160
Uh, it's 397 kilos.

36:07.240 --> 36:10.680
Twenty-three million,
eight hundred and twenty thousand euros.

36:10.680 --> 36:11.720
Fuck yeah.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.760
Eduardo, how much is that in escudos?

36:15.440 --> 36:16.680
A boatload of cash.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.560
The sauce is good, huh? Mmm.

36:21.560 --> 36:24.040
How the fuck
are you hungry right now?

36:25.400 --> 36:28.160
You feed the body
to calm the spirit.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.560
Hunger is a bad adviser,
that's what I say.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.360
Francesco,
we're fucked. Fucked!

36:33.360 --> 36:35.480
We have to call
Don Massimo to explain.

36:35.480 --> 36:38.000
No,
Don Massimo can't help us.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.760
The sooner we recover
the cargo, the sooner we go home.

36:40.760 --> 36:44.640
Did you see them?
They looked like monkeys eating peanuts.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.680
Gianluca.

36:46.960 --> 36:49.920
I have a lot more to lose
than you in this whole thing.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.680
But losing your head now
is fucking pointless.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.680
Come on, keep cool.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.000
Drink a glass of wine
and relax.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.040
Everything will
work out fine. Okay?

36:59.040 --> 37:00.280
Go fuck yourself!

37:01.880 --> 37:02.920
Gianluca!

37:10.120 --> 37:10.960
No.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.680
It's a lot of snow. Can we manage it?

37:19.160 --> 37:21.640
Well, this snow just washed up here.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.560
We didn't plan for this, did we?
It came to our beach, right?

37:26.560 --> 37:29.320
This much will attract the cops.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.760
And this ass won't end up in prison. No.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.800
And these drugs belong
to someone, Eduardo.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.160
Pretty soon, they'll come looking for it.

37:38.760 --> 37:39.960
And they'll bring guns.

37:43.360 --> 37:46.640
Why do some people have everything
while others have nothing, huh?

37:47.440 --> 37:48.280
Why?

37:50.200 --> 37:52.000
I was the best student in my class.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.560
But I had to quit school
to go out fishing every night.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.480
Rafael...

37:59.720 --> 38:01.160
you could play in Benfica.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.880
But now you limp every time it rains,

38:04.880 --> 38:06.240
and you spend your life lost

38:06.240 --> 38:08.960
between what you once were
and what you never became.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.200
And you, Carlinhos.

38:15.480 --> 38:18.240
Sure, men want to fuck you. It's true.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.240
But did any of them take you out
for dinner first? Hmm?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.920
Did they take you to see a movie?

38:26.760 --> 38:28.240
In what world does that story of yours

38:28.240 --> 38:30.280
end with,
"And they lived happily ever after"?

38:30.280 --> 38:32.120
You know that's never gonna happen.

38:32.680 --> 38:33.920
No.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.920
Do you want to be tied
to a counter in Rabo de Peixe

38:45.920 --> 38:47.720
for the rest of your life, Sílvia?

38:48.680 --> 38:49.880
Sílvia, I'm talking to you.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.920
You don't want that, right?

38:54.120 --> 38:56.200
Or living off benefits, like your mother?

39:07.320 --> 39:10.360
What the fuck have we done
to deserve this fate?

39:11.280 --> 39:14.280
What have we done to deserve this fate?
For fuck's sake, right?

39:14.800 --> 39:17.240
Why doesn't good luck
ever fall here on this land? Never?

39:17.240 --> 39:19.320
- Why?
- It's God's will, that's all.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.240
It's God's will, Rafael, huh?

39:21.240 --> 39:23.160
Then that's also God's will, right there!

39:24.280 --> 39:26.280
This is also God's will, Rafael.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.840
God only punishes us? Huh?

39:31.080 --> 39:33.080
From time to time,
can't he help us as well?

39:34.520 --> 39:35.760
Sílvia, you said it yourself.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.400
Nothing good ever happens here,
but it's happening.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.880
It is happening now, here, right now!

39:40.880 --> 39:43.400
This is our chance,
and it only happens once in a lifetime.

39:43.400 --> 39:44.760
Once, this is it!

39:44.760 --> 39:47.080
We do this now,
or it will never happen again.

40:02.480 --> 40:03.640
My mother died.

40:07.160 --> 40:08.200
And my dad...

40:10.120 --> 40:12.760
My dad's vision is deteriorating so fast
he can't see anything.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.800
I haven't got anything
for free my whole life.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.080
Absolutely nothing.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.440
Zero. And I've had enough.

40:25.120 --> 40:28.400
Haven't we all had enough?
Aren't you tired of it? Huh?

40:29.320 --> 40:32.360
Aren't you tired of being mackerels
in a shark-infested ocean?

40:35.400 --> 40:36.240
Huh?

40:46.520 --> 40:49.160
Fucking shit!

41:14.240 --> 41:15.800
Nice one, bro.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.000
Soon, we'll be rich.

41:22.160 --> 41:23.040
Right?

41:27.160 --> 41:28.680
- Don Massimo.
-<i>Who is this?</i>

41:28.680 --> 41:31.440
- Hi. It's Gianluca.
-<i>Is everything okay?</i>

41:31.440 --> 41:34.600
I have
something important to tell you.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.840
Second-best ass in Rabo de Peixe, fucker!

41:38.440 --> 41:39.320
What is it?

41:40.280 --> 41:41.240
You want to drive?

41:41.880 --> 41:44.160
Huh? I'm trusting you.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.840
Tomorrow is procession day,

41:45.840 --> 41:47.920
and this pretty face
needs the beauty sleep.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.200
Oh, handsome!

41:49.200 --> 41:51.720
Beautiful ass.

41:54.720 --> 41:55.560
Let's go.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.560
Ah!

42:02.240 --> 42:03.880
<i>A problem with the Colombian?</i>

42:03.880 --> 42:05.600
<i>-</i> No.
<i>- With the police?</i>

42:05.600 --> 42:06.920
No, no, no.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.640
<i>What happened, Gianluca?</i>

42:09.480 --> 42:10.680
We lost the cargo.

42:13.640 --> 42:16.320
I fucking love this song so much.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.480
Whoo!

42:27.200 --> 42:28.680
Fuck yeah!

42:29.280 --> 42:30.280
Fuck!

42:38.520 --> 42:40.560
Hey, tell me how much
that shit is worth again.

42:40.560 --> 42:43.320
Twenty-three million,
eight hundred and twenty thousand euros.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.520
Oh! Twenty-three million!

42:46.520 --> 42:48.400
We're gonna be fucking rich!

42:54.760 --> 42:58.040
<i>Speak up, asshole! Gianluca?</i>

42:59.440 --> 43:01.440
<i>Gianluca?
What happened? Gianlu--</i>

43:07.520 --> 43:09.600
- No, no, no!
- Don't fucking touch him, Rafael!

43:09.600 --> 43:11.080
Get the fuck out of the car!

43:15.960 --> 43:18.240
He's dead, isn't he?

43:19.560 --> 43:20.600
Let's go to the police.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.360
- We can't go the police, man!
- Let's go to the police, let's say--

43:23.360 --> 43:25.440
We can't go to the police!
What's wrong with you?

43:25.440 --> 43:27.720
How much cocaine did you do today? Fuck!

43:29.520 --> 43:32.520
What are you doing, Eduardo?
Don't touch that guy! Fuck.

43:32.520 --> 43:34.080
Eduardo, what are you doing?

43:34.080 --> 43:36.840
- What? Drop that fucking shit!
- Oh, my God. He's a freaking foreigner.

43:36.840 --> 43:38.440
- Let's go to the police.
- He's Italian.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.760
Are you gonna tell the police
we killed an Italian tourist?

43:40.760 --> 43:42.360
We tell them it was a fucking accident!

43:42.360 --> 43:44.920
What's the police gonna say
about guys from Rabo de Peixe killing

43:44.920 --> 43:47.440
an Italian tourist? Push the guy.

43:48.440 --> 43:50.000
- No, no, no!
- Push the guy.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.800
What do you mean, "No"?
We must get him out of here, Sílvia.

43:52.800 --> 43:55.040
Don't you fucking understand it?
Push the guy, Rafael.

43:55.040 --> 43:58.840
Push, come on! God damn it,
don't pull! Push, Rafael! Push the guy!

43:58.840 --> 44:00.440
For Christ's sake, listen to me!

44:00.440 --> 44:01.960
Push the fucking guy.

44:06.760 --> 44:08.440
Jesus Christ.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.480
What are we going to do, Eduardo?

44:13.480 --> 44:15.200
We have to fucking take him
away from here.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.520
- What do you mean we take him--
- Let's move him!

44:17.520 --> 44:19.840
- Grab this shit. Come on!
- Where do you want to take him?

44:41.920 --> 44:43.080
Oh, fuck.

46:39.640 --> 46:41.640
