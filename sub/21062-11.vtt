20:41.670 --> 20:43.535
to run the farm
by yourself after harvest.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.455
Oh, so we cool now?

20:45.500 --> 20:46.933
I'm supposed to act
like you ain't just

20:46.980 --> 20:48.800
making me look dumb
in front of everybody?

20:48.850 --> 20:50.841
- That's not what I was doing.
- Sure felt like it.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.892
I was showing
that a farm is a business,

20:53.940 --> 20:56.204
and decisions
need _to be based
on so|Id reasonIng

20:56.250 --> 20:57.683
for the business
to succeed.

20:57.730 --> 20:59.288
Maybe that's what you
thought you was doing,

20:59.340 --> 21:00.819
but ain't nobody else
asked nothin'

21:00.860 --> 21:02.509
after you put me
in my place.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.949
Ralph Angel, that was
a critical thinking exercise.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.082
It can be intimidating
for students

21:07.130 --> 21:09.086
to realize how much
they have to learn.

21:09.130 --> 21:11.826
- Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.304
Looked to me
like you was being
a know-it-all.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.089
[ scoffs ]

21:16.140 --> 21:18.529
Now I know why
you and Charley
are together.

21:18.580 --> 21:20.059
Makes sense.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.498
Sorry to just drop by,

21:30.550 --> 21:33.280
but I need
a second opInIon
on this stuff.

21:33.330 --> 21:35.378
- Okay if I change
in your room?
- Uh, wait.

21:35.420 --> 21:36.637
Charley,
I can't find the--

21:41.080 --> 21:42.729
Nova, hello.

21:42.770 --> 21:44.556
Hello, Lorna.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.947
Well, Nova,
it's lovely to see you.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.774
You are--
you are lookIng well.

21:50.830 --> 21:51.774
Thanks.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.209
Now, I wanted to...

21:57.490 --> 21:59.390
You know,
I don't know,

21:59.440 --> 22:02.000
it feels odd to say

22:02.050 --> 22:05.793
that I want to extend
my condolences
about Ernest,

22:05.840 --> 22:06.795
but I do.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.364
Why is that
odd to you?

22:08.410 --> 22:11.789
_ _ Because
It's Impersonal, and...

22:13.500 --> 22:17.027
And Ernest's passing
was very personal to me.

22:18.850 --> 22:20.374
Lorna,
I could stand here

22:20.420 --> 22:22.069
and try to wade
through all the pain

22:22.120 --> 22:25.681
you caused my family
with your personal affairs,

22:25.730 --> 22:27.686
but I choose not to.

22:30.210 --> 22:31.427
Take care.

22:34.220 --> 22:37.383
Well, I wish
that you would stay.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.089
And I wish that you

22:39.140 --> 22:41.005
would consider that the things
that you heard about me

22:41.050 --> 22:42.608
when you were a child
or a teenager

22:42.660 --> 22:45.311
might not have been
the way it actually happened.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.577
Calling my mother
a liar?

22:46.620 --> 22:49.350
[ sighs ]
No.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.832
Neven

22:50.890 --> 22:55.918
I always thought
that Trudy was a heroine,

22:55.980 --> 22:57.197
'cause she was special,

22:57.240 --> 22:58.935
and I looked up to her.

22:58.980 --> 23:00.936
I only wish that
she had known that.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.800
What are you talking about?
You took her man.

23:02.850 --> 23:05.375
I'm-- I'll see you
later, Charley.

23:05.420 --> 23:07.376
Wait, Nova.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.422
On our first date,
he told me that
the woman he loved

23:09.470 --> 23:13.645
did not love him
enough to marry him.

23:13.690 --> 23:18.639
See, Trudy and Ernest
were already broken up
when I met him.

23:18.700 --> 23:21.168
And he came
to California,

23:21.220 --> 23:24.303
and he was away
from his home
and his land

23:24.350 --> 23:25.874
for the first time.

23:28.620 --> 23:32.442
And it was
the love of his life
that sent him away.

23:32.490 --> 23:35.141
He told me that Trudy
was a free spirit.

23:35.190 --> 23:40.537
She wanted a more
free-flowing relationship.

23:40.590 --> 23:44.412
But he
didn't want that.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.587
He wanted tradition.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.729
So he came to California

23:51.770 --> 23:53.590
just to put some distance
between them.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.552
He talked about her
to you like that?

23:56.600 --> 24:00.422
Yes. He talked
about her a lot.

24:02.870 --> 24:04.781
On our very first date,

24:04.830 --> 24:06.388
he told me
that he loved her.

24:08.490 --> 24:09.969
And that is how
we started.

24:10.010 --> 24:11.443
That's the man
that I met.

24:11.490 --> 24:14.482
He was very clear
about what he wanted.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.929
And I wanted
the same things.

24:16.970 --> 24:18.881
Marriage, home,

24:18.930 --> 24:22.149
and children.

24:22.190 --> 24:25.842
But little did we know
Trudy was already
pregnant with you.

24:25.890 --> 24:28.768
Not till after
we were together.

24:31.730 --> 24:34.244
And I will admit that...

24:36.770 --> 24:39.034
I didn't want him to go

24:39.080 --> 24:42.379
and that I was afraid
that he would leave,

24:42.430 --> 24:44.250
but he did come
back to St. Jo

24:44.300 --> 24:47.349
to confront Trudy
when he heard about you.

24:49.130 --> 24:51.690
And she said--
and I will never
forget this...

24:54.140 --> 24:57.576
She said,
"I fell in love

24:57.620 --> 25:00.054
with someone
hiding inside you,

25:00.100 --> 25:02.409
and I don't want
to hide with you."

25:04.110 --> 25:05.270
And I thought
she was...

25:07.110 --> 25:08.543
so brave...

25:11.240 --> 25:13.288
for letting him go.

25:13.330 --> 25:15.935
Even though she was
expecting you.

25:15.990 --> 25:17.548
I thought,
"I could never do that."

25:19.510 --> 25:22.729
But she gave me
what I wanted.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.601
[ sighs ]

25:26.650 --> 25:29.733
Nova, do you really think
that I could have

25:29.780 --> 25:32.999
evertaken
anything away from her
that she didn't want...

25:34.620 --> 25:35.780
to give?

25:38.050 --> 25:42.794
It's so far,
so far away.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.449
- Oh, man!
- That is pass interference.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.229
They don't call
pass interference
on The Tide.

25:54.290 --> 25:56.929
Oh, the game's
still going?

25:56.990 --> 25:59.720
I thought I heard
the final score
on the radio.

25:59.770 --> 26:02.238
Hey, Vi,
this is my friend Will.

26:02.290 --> 26:04.770
Hey. Thank you
for having me over.

26:04.820 --> 26:06.117
This sound system
is great.

26:06.170 --> 26:09.515
Oh, that's--
that's all Holleood.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.949
Yeah, the game is over,
but, uh,

26:12.000 --> 26:13.695
look, man, you're
welcome to stay,

26:13.740 --> 26:15.560
but all I'll be doing
is talking about

26:15.610 --> 26:17.214
how bad we smacked
y'all down.

26:17.270 --> 26:18.521
Nah, I gotta get.

26:18.570 --> 26:19.912
Plus, I got a feeling
you're probably

26:19.960 --> 26:21.746
gonna tell me
about it Monday anyway.

26:21.790 --> 26:24.611
Gonna find a way
to spend the rest
of my weekend.

26:24.670 --> 26:25.830
Thank you so much.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.279
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Violet.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.709
Nice to meet you,
too, Will.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.625
Uh, catch you
on Monday, chief.

26:31.670 --> 26:32.716
All right.

26:34.720 --> 26:38.065
[ door opens,
closes ]

26:40.770 --> 26:43.591
[ sighs ]

26:43.640 --> 26:45.153
Did I do
something wrong?

26:45.210 --> 26:48.907
Just some warning
would have been nice
Is all.

26:48.950 --> 26:51.339
Oh, come on now.
You're friendly with
plenty of white folks.

26:51.390 --> 26:53.426
I didn't say nothing
about him being white.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.993
You didn't say nothin',
but you thought it.
I know that.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.905
All I said was

26:56.960 --> 26:58.780
I was thrown off guard.

26:58.830 --> 27:01.264
Okay. I'm just thinking
you're feeling some
kind of way.

27:01.310 --> 27:05.349
I mean, I ain't used
to having them coming
up in my house,

27:05.400 --> 27:06.958
you know, hangin' out,

27:07.010 --> 27:09.353
but, hey, if that's
what you wanna do.

27:09.410 --> 27:13.790
Vi, honey,
you sound like

27:13.840 --> 27:15.580
something else
right now.

27:15.630 --> 27:16.927
That don't
even sound right.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.193
Well, it sounds
right to me.

27:20.240 --> 27:23.027
See-- see,
and it's things like this

27:23.070 --> 27:26.858
that reminds me that
no matter how good
our rhythm is,

27:26.900 --> 27:29.721
_ we from _
two dIfferent generatIons.

27:29.770 --> 27:32.557
Age ain't
got nothing to do

27:32.600 --> 27:34.989
with what you talking
about right now, Vi.

27:43.310 --> 27:46.006
You want to go
to the grocery store
right now or just go home?

27:46.050 --> 27:48.302
No, we can go.

27:50.490 --> 27:51.661
Okay.

27:51.710 --> 27:54.577
Also, I was hoping that

27:54.620 --> 27:56.702
maybe we could find
some time this weekend

27:56.760 --> 27:59.365
to do that exercise
that Father Julian gave us.

27:59.410 --> 28:01.935
Remind me _
what It was agaIn.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.710
Listening
and communication
exerCIse,

28:04.770 --> 28:06.715
where we set up
obstacle courses

28:06.770 --> 28:09.591
and blindfold each other

28:09.640 --> 28:10.948
and guide
the other person
with words.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.639
Sound like
a game for Blue.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.111
I don't
mean it like that.

28:16.170 --> 28:17.558
Darla.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.731
[ sighs ]

28:22.780 --> 28:23.951
You want me to pack
this up, honey?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.171
Yeah.

28:25.220 --> 28:27.472
Hey.
How you doin', Darla?

28:27.530 --> 28:29.088
I'm okay.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.779
Uh-oh.
You sure about that?

28:31.840 --> 28:35.094
I'm sorry.
Ralph Angel's in a mood,

28:35.140 --> 28:37.313
and it's affecting mine,
I guess.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.533
He still upset
about last night's class?

28:39.580 --> 28:41.013
What happened last night?
Thank you.

28:41.060 --> 28:42.140
He didn't
say anything?

28:42.190 --> 28:44.533
No. I mean,
I know he was worried

28:44.590 --> 28:45.750
about slowing
everyone down.

28:45.810 --> 28:47.584
- Did he?
- [ chuckles ] No.

28:47.630 --> 28:51.020
No, he's fine.
Listen, it's an
intro-level course.

28:51.070 --> 28:52.765
They're all starting
at the same place.

28:52.810 --> 28:54.630
Ralph Angel:
Don't worry about it.
I'm out.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.079
I'll talk to you
in a minute.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.372
Got a second?

28:58.430 --> 29:00.034
- [ exhales ]
- I thought we should

29:00.080 --> 29:02.514
- clear a couple things up--
- Hey, there's no need.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.209
I ain't going back.

29:04.260 --> 29:05.739
Oh, so you quit now?

29:05.780 --> 29:06.951
After one class?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.649
One class to show me
what I already know.

29:08.700 --> 29:09.655
School ain't for me.

29:09.700 --> 29:10.951
Never has been.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.478
That's an excuse,
Ralph Angel.

29:13.530 --> 29:16.829
Only teacher
ever paid me attention
was the gym coach,

29:16.880 --> 29:19.132
'cause he wanted me
to be on the track team.

29:19.190 --> 29:21.226
Rest of 'em treat me
like I can't _read
or somethIng.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.362
So you thought
that's the way
I treated you last night?

29:23.410 --> 29:25.401
Everybody do me like that.

29:25.450 --> 29:27.498
You_ain't do
nothIng new.

29:30.150 --> 29:32.710
All right.

29:34.590 --> 29:35.761
I want to apologize...

29:37.860 --> 29:39.509
for making you
feel small.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.766
And I mean that
smcerely,

29:40.820 --> 29:42.811
and I hope
you hear that.

29:42.860 --> 29:44.771
'Cause you're not small,
Ralph Angel.

29:44.820 --> 29:46.424
Man, you got a big heart,
you got a big spirit,

29:46.480 --> 29:48.471
you got a big brain.

29:48.520 --> 29:52.911
But you also got
a big case of luggage

29:52.960 --> 29:54.211
that you're carrying
around with you

29:54.270 --> 29:56.170
everywhere you go.

29:56.220 --> 29:59.098
And that makes
everything feel heavier
than it needs to be.

29:59.140 --> 30:01.745
Now, we all gotta
carry it sometimes.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.963
Hell, most of the time,
actually.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.011
But, brother,
you should know
when you with me,

30:07.060 --> 30:09.711
you can put that down,

30:11.540 --> 30:13.713
And I never
mean you any harm.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.365
Look here,
if you can't put it down,

30:16.420 --> 30:18.547
let me know that, too,

30:18.590 --> 30:21.206
and I'll carry it
with you.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.684
'Cause I know you'd do
the same thing for me.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.378
He flew into the sun

30:27.430 --> 30:30.251
Let's see
how long you run

30:30.300 --> 30:33.087
While you're hiding
from your soul...

30:33.130 --> 30:34.256
Love you, boy.

30:34.310 --> 30:35.732
Love you, too, dawg.

30:37.570 --> 30:39.959
- We're straight.
- All right.

30:40.010 --> 30:42.433
I'll see y'all
later.

30:45.140 --> 30:48.792
We can't have
your hands hurting.

30:48.840 --> 30:52.230
So I brought you
my go-tos.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.067
Take a chance
and find out...

30:55.110 --> 30:58.716
- And of course,
there's always this.
- Find out who you are...

31:01.860 --> 31:04.852
And let
your soul control

31:04.900 --> 31:07.721
Where you're going.

31:07.770 --> 31:10.819
- Shall we?
- No, it's for you.

31:10.860 --> 31:12.737
It's good medicine.

31:12.780 --> 31:15.908
Put yourself
in a warm bath
with those oils

31:15.960 --> 31:19.657
and relax your muscles
and your mind.

31:21.220 --> 31:25.839
This is

I hope Charley don't
bring her around here.

of that lately.

of his co-workers in here.

Lorna all these years
because she was white?

she conducts herself.

she owned Ernest.

she was better than us.

I'm asking for real.

How did Mom
feel about Lorna?

32:37.390 --> 32:41.030
Like, what happened?

32:41.080 --> 32:42.604
All these years,
I've been hatin' on her

32:42.650 --> 32:45.380
because
everybody else did.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.738
But what did she do?

32:47.790 --> 32:49.951
Did she break them up?

32:52.570 --> 32:54.265
It's complicated.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.221
No, she didn't
break them up,

32:57.270 --> 32:59.886
but she did stand in the way
of them getting back together.

32:59.930 --> 33:00.885
How?

33:03.060 --> 33:05.199

everything.

to explore and whatnot,

before he left for
California?

33:36.360 --> 33:38.316
Yeah, but...

33:40.490 --> 33:42.048

he was gonna go there

a white lady.

33:44.670 --> 33:46.149

33:46.190 --> 33:47.976

34:00.290 --> 34:02.246

things her way,

34:02.300 --> 34:05.997

she turned him down.

But she did not think
It was permanent.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.769

about Lorna directly.

I think I got this feeling
about her from you.

34:52.350 --> 34:54.648
And what's wrong
with that?

34:54.700 --> 34:59.342
Well, it's wrong

34:59.400 --> 35:01.618

who she is for myself.

35:03.620 --> 35:04.962
And I should.
