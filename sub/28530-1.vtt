WEBVTT

01:53.814 --> 01:55.714
And you're just
watching this woman

01:55.716 --> 01:58.083
this mind just like

01:58.085 --> 02:01.086
shut down bit by bit, you know?

02:03.357 --> 02:05.557
<i>I know it's hard seeing that.</i>

02:05.559 --> 02:07.993
Yeah, but... but then
the moment you're back

02:07.995 --> 02:10.729
in the, in the singing,
she's just like alive again.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.866
She starts with these
kind of like, these moves.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.868
<i>And you know..</i>

02:17.171 --> 02:19.171
<i>I guess she's..</i>

02:20.975 --> 02:23.375
That it's, it's okay.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.044
It's very sweet that you visit.
You're a good grandson.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.647
Well, yeah, she's my nana.

02:28.649 --> 02:32.384
You'll be a good dad.
And such a good, sweet dad.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.853
Lucy, come on,
why are you doin' that?

02:34.855 --> 02:36.321
I'm... I'm moving in with you.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.423
I think... I think that should
be enough for right now.

02:38.425 --> 02:42.461
Oh, okay, I was just saying,
I don't know

02:42.463 --> 02:45.531
I thought... I thought you were
sweet and I just wanna meet

02:45.533 --> 02:48.267
our little Alex or Alexandria.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.636
It is just so totally,
totally insane

02:50.638 --> 02:52.804
that you're talking about
having kids when we..

02:52.806 --> 02:56.975
I, I know I get it, I know.
I was just.. God, nothing.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.211
Just... just think about it
for a second.

02:59.213 --> 03:02.581
I mean, you work at a museum
and I do web design

03:02.583 --> 03:04.483
for a company
that's downsizing every week.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.951
I mean, that's a... that's a
great environment

03:05.953 --> 03:07.519
to be bringing a kid into.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.055
<i>I was... I was just saying
that you'd be a good dad.</i>

03:10.057 --> 03:12.457
<i>Nobody's bringing any kids
into anything.</i>

03:15.563 --> 03:18.130
Look, we've been out of college
for like ten minutes.

03:18.132 --> 03:20.265
<i>Well, look at you now,
you're doing the hair thing.</i>

03:20.267 --> 03:21.567
<i>Don't start freaking out.</i>

03:21.569 --> 03:23.769
I'm not freaking out,
I'm fixing my hair.

03:23.771 --> 03:27.005
You are <i> so</i> defensive. I..

03:27.007 --> 03:28.674
I was just trying..

03:29.743 --> 03:31.610
God, I don't even know what..

03:33.013 --> 03:35.147
<i>See what you do is, you just,
you keep setting me up</i>

03:35.149 --> 03:38.850
<i>to become a disappointment,
you know?</i>

03:38.852 --> 03:40.385
<i>Every time you raise the bar
and I can't keep up</i>

03:40.387 --> 03:44.957
<i>I have to feel like a fucking
asshole. Because you know why?</i>

03:44.959 --> 03:46.592
<i>'Cause it makes me feel like
I don't love you enough</i>

03:46.594 --> 03:48.927
<i>when I don't want to have kids
with you when we're like 23...</i>

03:48.929 --> 03:50.829
You're obviously having
a total meltdown.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.165
Do you just..
You don't wanna do this.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.202
No, of course, I wanna do this.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.075
But I am gonna go.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.145
What, now... now you're mad?

04:07.147 --> 04:08.981
I'm not mad, I just..

04:11.785 --> 04:13.719
I have to see
nana in the morning

04:13.721 --> 04:16.454
<i>and it makes more sense for me
to be at my place.</i>

04:18.692 --> 04:20.692
I'm sorry to disappoint.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.067
Well, aren't you, at least,
gonna put this on?

04:29.069 --> 04:31.069
It's your birthday present.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.340
Yeah.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.245
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.622
Happy Birthday.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.425
Thanks, babe.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.931
It's.. Stay, we don't have to
talk about anything anymore.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.433
Oh, come on, baby.

05:03.404 --> 05:07.406
I'll call you, alright?
We got tomorrow.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.035
You're awake.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.905
You're up.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.640
You're... you're... you're up!

09:02.309 --> 09:04.242
Oh, okay.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.545
Uh, okay.

09:06.547 --> 09:09.481
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, uh.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.316
Oh, uh, ca... can you say that?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.685
Can you say o... okay?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.353
Try to say "Okay."

09:18.926 --> 09:21.660
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.763
I had a pulse yesterday.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.170
I, uh, I have to name you.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.844
Adam? It's so corny.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.113
I..

09:42.115 --> 09:45.016
Shit! I can't think. Um..

09:49.756 --> 09:51.089
Adam.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.934
Adam.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.304
I'm Henry.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.940
I'm your..

10:16.183 --> 10:18.016
Uh..

10:18.018 --> 10:21.720
Wait, uh, we need
to get a picture..

10:21.722 --> 10:24.889
For you Uncle Polidori.

10:27.894 --> 10:31.129
This is where you'll stay!

10:31.131 --> 10:32.530
Oh.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.893
This is your room.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.462
Recover here and become strong.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.799
You will stay here.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.234
You will not leave

11:09.236 --> 11:11.736
until we are ready,
you understand?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.073
You understand?

11:16.243 --> 11:17.575
I want you..

11:18.478 --> 11:20.078
To be safe.

11:26.787 --> 11:30.355
And the most important
thing for you..

11:33.160 --> 11:34.492
Will be sleep..

11:35.328 --> 11:37.429
So your brain can recover.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.290
<i>She started
these kind of like, these moves.</i>

12:05.292 --> 12:07.025
<i>And, you know..</i>

12:08.795 --> 12:10.295
<i>I guess she's..</i>

12:12.099 --> 12:14.799
<i>That it's, it's okay.</i>

12:14.801 --> 12:16.501
<i>It's very sweet
that you would say that.</i>

12:16.503 --> 12:19.204
<i>- You're a good grandson.
- Well, yeah, she's my nana.</i>

12:20.273 --> 12:21.273
Alex.

12:23.844 --> 12:27.312
It's okay, Adam. It's okay.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.913
Let's put these on.

12:33.854 --> 12:37.188
So, let's get you checked out,
okay, Adam?

12:46.233 --> 12:49.234
Open. Close.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.975
Now, Adam, you need drugs.

12:56.977 --> 13:00.945
Don't worry.
Most of America is on drugs.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.914
Uh, uppers, downers

13:02.916 --> 13:06.117
pain killers, mood enhancers.

13:06.119 --> 13:10.121
Blood pressure, diabetes,
opioids and meth.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.891
Seen it on TV.

13:16.062 --> 13:19.063
Somebody is very eager
to meet you.

13:23.870 --> 13:27.438
Okay, now for you, we have got..

13:28.542 --> 13:30.675
Dilantin for your
brain seizures.

13:30.677 --> 13:35.146
<i>Uh, Butoxamine, Heparin.</i>

13:35.148 --> 13:38.750
<i>Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate</i>

13:38.752 --> 13:40.585
<i>pH, beta blockers</i>

13:40.587 --> 13:42.921
<i>blood thinners, coagulators..</i>

13:45.258 --> 13:49.794
<i>Mood enhancers,
blood pressure, diabetes</i>

13:49.796 --> 13:51.329
<i>opioids and meth.</i>

14:00.640 --> 14:03.074
<i>Pain killers. Mood enhancers.</i>

14:03.076 --> 14:06.277
<i>And, of course..</i>

14:06.279 --> 14:08.146
<i>Polidori's own</i>

14:08.148 --> 14:12.083
<i>new and improved
magic Rapamycin.</i>

14:12.886 --> 14:14.786
"Rap X" he calls it.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.890
<i>I give you life..</i>

14:18.892 --> 14:20.592
<i>And he keeps you alive.</i>

14:35.942 --> 14:37.475
No, no, no, no, no.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.478
The ones that match.
Put 'em together.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.449
No. The moon, the moon.

14:44.451 --> 14:45.984
<i>No, the moon, the moon.</i>

14:45.986 --> 14:47.719
Okay.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.721
<i>Moon, moon, no.</i>

14:53.727 --> 14:57.028
There you go.
Put it where it matches.

14:57.030 --> 15:01.499
Barn. Barn, fits. See?

15:02.769 --> 15:05.637
<i>Barn. No. Barn.</i>

15:05.639 --> 15:08.606
<i>Hmm. Barn. No. Barn.</i>

15:08.608 --> 15:10.441
<i>Moon. Moon. Barn.</i>

15:20.053 --> 15:21.386
Shit!

15:22.689 --> 15:24.188
<i>Let's get up.</i>

15:24.190 --> 15:26.557
<i>Let's get that taken care of.</i>

15:27.794 --> 15:30.395
<i>"When Simon is hiding,
where can he be?"</i>

15:30.397 --> 15:33.665
"Is he hiding under
the Truffula tree?"

15:33.667 --> 15:36.334
"No one is sure, no one can say."

15:36.336 --> 15:39.504
"Some people think Simon
has just run away."

15:42.676 --> 15:45.910
"But I know that Simon
is hiding quite near.

15:45.912 --> 15:49.580
You just have to look,
use your eyes and your ear."

15:59.059 --> 16:01.059
You like that left side
of your brain huh?

16:02.395 --> 16:04.062
Let's try this one.

16:13.907 --> 16:16.975
<i>What you got to do. What you
got to do. What you got to do.</i>

16:16.977 --> 16:18.776
<i>What you got to do.</i>

16:18.778 --> 16:21.512
<i>"Now Simon is hiding
where can he be?"</i>

16:21.514 --> 16:25.216
<i>"Is he hiding under
the Truffula tree?"</i>

16:25.218 --> 16:28.186
<i>"No one is sure, no one can say."</i>

16:28.188 --> 16:30.855
<i>"People think Simon
has just run away."</i>

16:34.661 --> 16:37.495
<i>"But I know that Simon
is hiding quite near.</i>

16:37.497 --> 16:41.065
<i>You just have to look.
Use your eyes and your ear."</i>

16:50.176 --> 16:53.011
<i>I wanna meet our little
Alex or Alexandria.</i>

16:53.013 --> 16:54.278
Eat.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.718
First, you are going
to do medicine..

17:00.720 --> 17:03.821
And then an experiment.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.393
Here we go.

17:09.963 --> 17:11.396
Close your eyes.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.097
That's it.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.618
<i>Adam? Adam?</i>

17:33.620 --> 17:35.987
<i>Now, I want you to try
the puzzle again.</i>

17:35.989 --> 17:38.823
I... I... I know you can do it.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.125
You can do it
because it's all there.

17:41.127 --> 17:44.796
It's still in your head.
You can access that information.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.931
<i>During the operation,
I had about</i>

17:46.933 --> 17:48.332
<i>three hours wiring up the brain.</i>

17:48.334 --> 17:50.568
It... it was the most complex
part and you know

17:50.570 --> 17:53.905
you... you lost neurons
like if you'd had a stroke

17:53.907 --> 17:55.773
or drank too much
for a couple of decades.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.308
<i>They won't regenerate.</i>

17:57.310 --> 18:00.912
<i>But the brain can reroute</i>

18:00.914 --> 18:03.147
<i>all those little synapses.</i>

18:03.149 --> 18:05.183
They will find
another way around.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.719
I mean, the plasticity
of the brain is fantastic

18:08.721 --> 18:12.957
<i>and what better stimulus
then self.</i>

18:12.959 --> 18:16.661
<i>But regularity
leaves impressions</i>

18:16.663 --> 18:18.696
<i>and creates a space</i>

18:18.698 --> 18:21.732
<i>for the mind to rejuvenate.</i>

18:21.734 --> 18:25.236
<i>Look at you go!
Adam! Puzzle master!</i>

18:35.081 --> 18:39.784
<i>Alright, you heard Bach
and then you heard Beethoven</i>

18:39.786 --> 18:41.719
<i>and then America came along.</i>

18:41.721 --> 18:46.290
<i>America gave us jazz
and the blues.</i>

18:46.292 --> 18:48.059
Pretty great, right?

18:49.529 --> 18:50.928
This..

18:52.465 --> 18:54.332
Is gravity.

18:54.334 --> 18:58.669
Gravity makes the ball go down.

19:00.673 --> 19:05.476
Gravity also keeps you
on the ground.

19:06.746 --> 19:10.047
Gravity is your friend.

19:11.885 --> 19:13.184
Now you try.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.760
<i>Good, again.</i>

19:28.601 --> 19:30.601
Gravity.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.404
What?

19:35.842 --> 19:38.809
Gravity is..

19:39.612 --> 19:40.978
Your friend.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.413
My God, yes.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.516
Gravity is..

19:46.886 --> 19:49.287
Your friend.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.855
Yes! Yes!

19:50.857 --> 19:53.891
Gravity is your friend.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.495
Yes! Yes!
That's it. Say it louder.

19:57.497 --> 20:01.332
Gravity is your friend.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.635
Gravity is your friend.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.070
Yes, say it again.

20:06.072 --> 20:09.073
Gravity is your friend.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.908
The boy talks!

20:10.910 --> 20:13.544
Gravity is your friend.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.413
What about dancing? Try dancing.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.282
Uh, okay, no. We'll try
that later, that's fine.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.052
Okay, let it drop.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.089
Ping pong.

20:27.193 --> 20:30.528
Ping pong.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.696
<i>Good.</i>

20:31.698 --> 20:34.632
This is your paddle,
this is the ball.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.167
I'm gonna drop the ball..

20:36.169 --> 20:38.102
And hit it over to you.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.503
You hit it back.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.479
Good. But, no.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.814
<i>Give me the ball.</i>

20:52.185 --> 20:53.784
<i>Pick up the paddle.</i>

20:54.754 --> 20:55.886
<i>Hit the ball to you</i>

20:55.888 --> 20:58.823
<i>you hit it
with the paddle, okay?</i>

20:58.825 --> 21:00.157
Let's try again.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.495
Good!

21:10.770 --> 21:12.870
<i>Come on, man,
you got to hit it back.</i>

21:42.802 --> 21:44.101
<i>Fuck!</i>

21:47.573 --> 21:49.707
I'm sorry,
I'm not mad at you, alright?

21:50.510 --> 21:52.076
I'm just mad at myself.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.252
<i>Mad at myself. Mad at myself.</i>

22:01.254 --> 22:02.753
<i>Mad at myself.</i>

22:05.091 --> 22:07.224
Henry is hiding.

22:07.226 --> 22:10.394
<i>If Simon is
hiding where can he be?</i>

22:10.396 --> 22:13.397
<i>Hiding under the Truffula tree.</i>

22:13.399 --> 22:15.800
<i>Sure and steady.</i>

22:29.549 --> 22:32.950
<i>You'll be a good dad.
And such a good, sweet dad.</i>

22:32.952 --> 22:34.985
<i>And such a good, sweet dad.</i>

23:07.754 --> 23:08.986
Adam.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.488
<i>Hope you're not
wandering around at night.</i>

23:10.490 --> 23:12.723
<i>Sleep is very important.</i>

23:15.828 --> 23:17.461
<i>No, he's not ready
to be shown, alright?</i>

23:17.463 --> 23:19.263
<i>I'm still worried
about regression.</i>

23:19.265 --> 23:21.866
<i>The, the brain may be
immunologically privileged</i>

23:21.868 --> 23:24.468
<i>but the rest of his body
is just a battle ground</i>

23:24.470 --> 23:26.971
<i>of tissues aching to go at it.</i>

23:26.973 --> 23:29.340
<i>Yes, I am just being cautious.</i>

23:29.342 --> 23:32.643
<i>If there's even a whiff of
rejection and inflammation</i>

23:32.645 --> 23:36.113
<i>the whole protocol
will be called into question.</i>

23:36.115 --> 23:38.315
Well, they should be concerned
if they're legit.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.651
So, I want to be sure.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.857
<i>I'm not sad you're away.
Thank God you're away.</i>

23:46.859 --> 23:48.325
<i>He wouldn't last a week</i>

23:48.327 --> 23:49.960
<i>with your hyped up energy
around here.</i>

23:53.666 --> 23:54.965
<i>He's recovering, you understand?</i>

23:54.967 --> 23:57.301
<i>He's not some junk bond
you can just flip.</i>

23:58.971 --> 24:00.037
<i>Okay.</i>

24:00.773 --> 24:02.506
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

24:11.317 --> 24:13.851
That was your Uncle Polidori
on the phone.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.586
He's very eager to meet you.

24:16.856 --> 24:19.023
Just come out here,
let me get a look at you.

24:23.396 --> 24:26.397
That's good. You look good.

24:26.399 --> 24:27.998
There's one thing though,
you see these buttons

24:28.000 --> 24:31.001
how they're uneven? Fix that.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.312
Yeah!

24:41.314 --> 24:43.614
But see, dude,
you forgot to shave your lip.

24:44.784 --> 24:45.916
Good job, buddy.

25:01.601 --> 25:04.235
<i>I bet you think..</i>

25:04.237 --> 25:07.471
<i>Your name is Adam because of..</i>

25:08.808 --> 25:10.341
<i>The Bible.</i>

25:10.343 --> 25:15.079
<i>Adam and Eve first
man, all that crap.</i>

25:16.082 --> 25:18.282
<i>Or maybe you..</i>

25:18.284 --> 25:20.751
<i>Don't even remember
what the Bible is.</i>

25:22.421 --> 25:24.788
<i>Yeah, I have been busy.</i>

25:24.790 --> 25:28.826
Well, I work at the clinic
a couple days a week.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.529
<i>Yes, I've been taking
my medications.</i>

25:32.298 --> 25:34.532
I feel better.

25:34.534 --> 25:37.968
I wanna see you too,
but you know I'm at the clinic.

25:37.970 --> 25:41.305
Polidori's got me
on this project.

25:42.608 --> 25:46.877
Jesus!
Let me call you back, Liz.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.379
Don't sneak up on me like that.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.281
Turn that fuckin' thing off!

25:51.851 --> 25:53.050
Here.

26:11.771 --> 26:14.505
<i>Woo Hoo! That's my boy!</i>

26:25.351 --> 26:28.852
<i>Adam, now there you are.</i>

26:28.854 --> 26:32.156
<i>Hiding, huh?
I hope you're hungry.</i>

26:33.225 --> 26:36.393
I'm sorry that I was away today.

26:37.697 --> 26:38.697
I, uh..

26:42.201 --> 26:44.201
I don't know, I guess I'm..

26:45.104 --> 26:48.372
Not used to any of this.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.414
Does that hurt?

27:00.786 --> 27:03.454
Why don't I remember?

27:06.025 --> 27:07.424
Remember what?

27:09.695 --> 27:13.530
Why don't I remember
being small?

27:14.934 --> 27:17.501
Huh, don't you?

27:20.139 --> 27:25.309
Well, you had a trauma.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.980
That's what we're dealing with.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.251
If your brain could remember.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.489
I do remember.

27:40.493 --> 27:41.625
What?

27:42.995 --> 27:44.428
A face.

27:45.731 --> 27:46.964
Really?

27:49.135 --> 27:50.334
Well..

27:51.604 --> 27:53.203
The brain plays..

27:53.205 --> 27:55.706
Lots of tricks, Adam.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.644
I had..

28:00.646 --> 28:03.981
A certain kinda brain
when I was young.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.718
And I remembered a lot.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.122
And I went to medical school.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.458
<i>And I kicked ass.</i>

28:16.095 --> 28:18.796
<i>And then I went
to the Middle East</i>

28:18.798 --> 28:23.600
<i>and... I got my ass kicked.</i>

28:25.204 --> 28:31.008
<i>They say... that I
saved a lot of people..</i>

28:31.010 --> 28:32.910
<i>While I was down range.</i>

28:35.848 --> 28:38.382
<i>I don't remember it that way.</i>

28:38.384 --> 28:40.617
<i>I remember all the ones
that I lost.</i>

28:40.619 --> 28:42.986
<i>You'll be okay. I got you, okay?</i>

28:42.988 --> 28:45.055
<i>Hang on!</i>

28:45.057 --> 28:49.359
Got me to thinkin',
bein' out there

28:49.361 --> 28:52.896
all that carnage, body parts.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.835
I did some things that would..

28:57.837 --> 28:59.837
Get you in a lot of trouble.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.708
But after I got back..

29:07.413 --> 29:11.882
I, uh, I told Polidori
about them.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.321
I don't know why.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.259
Old friend, I guess.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.066
Anyway..

29:31.837 --> 29:33.871
Now here we are.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.056
Hello!

30:30.629 --> 30:32.262
Henry?

30:37.436 --> 30:39.369
Henry?

30:53.319 --> 30:57.321
Um, sorry to barge in.

31:00.226 --> 31:03.227
Are you a friend of Henry's?

31:05.631 --> 31:07.497
Is Henry here?

31:10.269 --> 31:12.603
Are you where Henry's been
all this time?

31:14.006 --> 31:16.073
Are you from the war?

31:21.814 --> 31:24.948
Um, try this on.

31:25.851 --> 31:27.784
Henry's easily jealous.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.354
Just..

31:34.994 --> 31:36.593
Yup.

31:40.299 --> 31:44.434
So, I am Liz.

31:44.436 --> 31:48.639
I'm Henry's... girlfriend

31:48.641 --> 31:50.641
for lack of a better word.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.345
Who are you?

31:57.349 --> 31:59.683
I'm Adam.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.690
Are you alright?

32:08.627 --> 32:10.961
- Liz.
- Henry.

32:12.197 --> 32:14.464
What are you doing here?
How... how did you get in?

32:14.466 --> 32:16.199
I still have keys.

32:17.403 --> 32:20.103
Right, of course. I just..

32:20.105 --> 32:23.240
Sorry, you sounded so down
on the phone I was worried.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.374
I've been worried
this whole time.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.842
<i>Well, Adam, go to your room!</i>

32:25.844 --> 32:28.078
<i>Put clothes on!</i>

32:28.080 --> 32:30.981
<i>Liz, I told you
I needed some time.</i>

32:30.983 --> 32:33.917
<i>I gave you time, I thought
you went to the VA Hospital</i>

32:33.919 --> 32:36.186
<i>in Washington to try
the program there.</i>

32:36.188 --> 32:38.455
<i>No, alright? I never left,
I've been here.</i>

32:38.457 --> 32:41.358
<i>Polidori's just letting you
stay here? Why?</i>

32:41.360 --> 32:43.593
<i>I'm not one of your
patients, Liz.</i>

32:43.595 --> 32:45.128
<i>The fact that you won't
acknowledge you have a problem</i>

32:45.130 --> 32:46.663
<i>is part of PTSD, Henry.</i>

32:46.665 --> 32:48.899
<i>I don't have PTSD.</i>

32:48.901 --> 32:51.501
<i>I've just been focused
on other things.</i>

32:51.503 --> 32:53.303
<i>Anyway, in case you think
I'm stalking you</i>

32:53.305 --> 32:55.138
<i>I'm here because
Polidori invited me.</i>

32:55.140 --> 32:57.007
<i>Has he even told you,
he's been tweeting about</i>

32:57.009 --> 32:59.176
<i>some pet project of yours.
What's he talking about?</i>

32:59.178 --> 33:01.712
<i>Jesus! He's a fuckin' idiot!</i>

33:01.714 --> 33:03.180
<i>He doesn't know
what he's doing, I told him</i>

33:03.182 --> 33:05.082
<i>I need more time.
He can't rush this.</i>

33:05.084 --> 33:07.084
<i>Rush what?</i>

33:08.454 --> 33:11.054
<i>Are you telling me
you went through with it?</i>

33:12.057 --> 33:13.557
<i>Yes.</i>

33:15.227 --> 33:16.893
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

33:18.163 --> 33:19.763
<i>You did it.</i>

33:21.967 --> 33:24.001
<i>You shit!</i>

33:26.171 --> 33:27.771
I'm so sorry I scared you.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.473
You must be so..

33:30.409 --> 33:31.842
Alone.

33:31.844 --> 33:34.111
<i>Alright, Liz, we have to go now.</i>

33:34.113 --> 33:35.979
Goodbye, Adam.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.917
<i>Henry, you brought the war
home with you.</i>

34:50.989 --> 34:54.056
<i>I've been away all month,
it's been excruciating.</i>

34:54.059 --> 34:56.560
<i>Like missing the birth
of your own child.</i>

34:56.562 --> 34:58.361
<i>How would you know?</i>

34:58.363 --> 35:00.130
<i>Shut up, Georgie.</i>

35:01.200 --> 35:03.200
<i>Henry's been secretive.</i>

35:04.236 --> 35:05.869
<i>I'm pissed.</i>

35:05.871 --> 35:07.404
<i>I think we can all agree
it's astonishing</i>

35:07.406 --> 35:08.872
<i>what a couple of years
in the theater of war</i>

35:08.874 --> 35:10.974
<i>can do to a man's
medical prowess.</i>

35:10.976 --> 35:13.110
<i>And his psyche.</i>

35:13.112 --> 35:15.312
<i>Well, we were able to get
fatalities down with</i>

35:15.314 --> 35:17.948
<i>the mobile triage unit when
we were closer to the action.</i>

35:17.950 --> 35:21.251
<i>Faster response times,
better results.</i>

35:21.253 --> 35:22.853
<i>Yeah, but anybody can think
about this stuff.</i>

35:22.855 --> 35:24.688
<i>You actually
did something about it.</i>

35:25.457 --> 35:27.724
You got skills.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.359
I mean, shit, man,
you can bring people

35:29.361 --> 35:33.797
back from the dead.
And I can keep them alive.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.433
I'm sure the girls don't want to
talk about this stuff, Polidori.

35:36.435 --> 35:39.269
Now, it's too late for that.
He won't shut up about it.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.472
That's why we're here, right?

35:42.474 --> 35:46.843
To bear witness,
while others are out

35:46.845 --> 35:49.613
fucking around
with molecular science..

35:50.649 --> 35:54.851
DNA in Petri dishes
or computers.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.655
We're in here
dealing with blood and guts.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.024
The totally tactile.

36:01.026 --> 36:03.160
The extreme sports of biology.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.196
<i>Both of you are going to end up
on the front page.</i>

36:06.198 --> 36:08.532
You're damn straight we are.

36:08.534 --> 36:12.135
And when we do, I've got
a whole speech worked out.

36:12.137 --> 36:13.937
Once people see this,
we can put Rap-X

36:13.939 --> 36:16.239
on the fast track to market.

36:16.241 --> 36:19.209
It's gonna save a lot of lives.

36:19.211 --> 36:22.512
It should make some SynTech
stock holders pretty happy.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.648
You and Georgina
should do very well.

36:24.650 --> 36:29.186
Either that or you'll drive the
whole company down in scandal.

36:29.188 --> 36:32.322
No. This is way too big
for that.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.492
<i>Well, Henry, here we are</i>

36:35.494 --> 36:38.862
our witnesses to the unavailing.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.264
Reality check.

36:42.668 --> 36:43.867
We've got a lot riding on this.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.468
I've got a lot
of very important people

36:45.470 --> 36:47.070
interested in what we're
doing here.

36:47.072 --> 36:49.639
<i>Well, I would really rather be
doing this in private.</i>

36:49.641 --> 36:53.677
<i>He's never met more than
one person at a time.</i>

36:53.679 --> 36:55.979
Come on, don't be
such a counter-parent.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.182
Adam, how did you..

37:00.752 --> 37:04.354
My God! Oh, my God!

37:05.924 --> 37:10.360
Well, so, this is it.

37:10.362 --> 37:13.330
Or this is Adam.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.200
Adam, how are you?

37:18.437 --> 37:19.836
How is he?

37:19.838 --> 37:22.172
He's good, uh, you know,
keepin' him busy

37:22.174 --> 37:24.874
with, uh, the Dilantin

37:24.876 --> 37:26.042
<i>the Taxamine, Heparin.</i>

37:26.044 --> 37:27.844
<i>Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate.</i>

37:27.846 --> 37:30.413
<i>Just trying to keep
the rejection to a minimum.</i>

37:30.415 --> 37:31.848
<i>Quite a cocktail
and you've been using</i>

37:31.850 --> 37:33.383
<i>the Rap X three times a day?</i>

37:33.385 --> 37:34.951
- Three a day.
- And all of him functions?

37:34.953 --> 37:37.921
Like he, he eats? He shits?

37:37.923 --> 37:39.155
Yes, yes and yes.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.524
And every single
part of him works?

37:42.227 --> 37:43.326
What do you mean?

37:43.328 --> 37:44.628
You know, cock and balls, Henry.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.863
This guy's got to be raging into
puberty any day now.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.298
You don't want to give him
a complex.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.533
Oh, I'm sure you'll be happy
to counsel him through.

37:50.535 --> 37:52.435
Anything for science.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.573
<i>- And can he talk?
- Yes.</i>

37:56.575 --> 37:59.242
<i>Uh, talking is something
we've been working on.</i>

37:59.244 --> 38:01.378
Isn't that right, Adam?

38:07.386 --> 38:10.153
That's right, Henry.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.957
And I think we are getting

38:13.959 --> 38:18.795
so much better... all the time.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.666
That can't happen again.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.834
We're doing this on <i> my</i> schedule.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.403
Do you understand?

38:26.905 --> 38:28.004
Come on.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.377
- Book.
- No, sleep.

38:34.379 --> 38:35.879
You'll fall asleep.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.318
Sleep.

38:45.557 --> 38:48.091
<i>I'm taking the girls away.</i>

38:48.093 --> 38:49.826
<i>They're extremely agitated.</i>

38:49.828 --> 38:52.095
<i>Well, you shouldn't have
brought 'em in the first place.</i>

38:52.097 --> 38:54.831
<i>Yeah, I'll take 'em in town
for a drink.</i>

38:54.833 --> 38:56.499
<i>You can't buy off Liz.</i>

38:56.501 --> 38:58.601
<i>You can buy off anyone, Henry.</i>

38:58.603 --> 39:01.471
<i>Come on, I want to see
Adam again.</i>

39:01.473 --> 39:02.872
<i>Bring him out here.</i>

39:02.874 --> 39:04.507
<i>I gave him a sedative,
he's all hyped up.</i>

39:04.509 --> 39:06.276
<i>The Rap-X is potent.</i>

39:06.278 --> 39:08.545
<i>The Rap X is working perfectly</i>

39:08.547 --> 39:10.780
<i>and it's gonna save
a lot of lives.</i>

39:10.782 --> 39:12.682
<i>I mean, that's why
we did this, Henry.</i>

39:12.684 --> 39:14.217
<i>We did it to make up
for everything</i>

39:14.219 --> 39:15.485
<i>that went wrong
on the battlefield.</i>

39:15.487 --> 39:17.354
<i>And, yeah, s... sure we did it</i>

39:17.356 --> 39:19.356
<i>to test out a drug
that would otherwise</i>

39:19.358 --> 39:20.857
<i>take you years
to get approval on.</i>

39:20.859 --> 39:22.926
<i>But they can't argue
with success.</i>

39:22.928 --> 39:24.160
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:24.162 --> 39:25.995
What the fuck is the matter
with you, man?

39:25.997 --> 39:27.731
Why aren't you ecstatic?

39:28.633 --> 39:30.066
I guess, I..

39:31.236 --> 39:33.203
I got so wrapped up
in the challenge of it

39:33.205 --> 39:35.872
I didn't think about him.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.075
The thrill of conception and now

39:39.077 --> 39:41.077
you've all of a sudden
lost interest.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.913
Maybe you're not cut out
for fatherhood.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.148
<i>That's not true.</i>

39:45.150 --> 39:48.752
I... I've spent time with him.
We've bonded.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.253
We..

39:50.255 --> 39:53.923
Jesus Christ,
I'm fucking with you, man.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.693
<i>No, you're,
you're a great daddy.</i>

39:56.695 --> 39:59.429
<i>But where do we go from here?
The experiment's over.</i>

39:59.431 --> 40:01.064
<i>Dude, what are you talking
about the experiment's over?</i>

40:01.066 --> 40:02.499
The experiment has just begun.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.101
Now we have to present him
to the world.

40:05.103 --> 40:06.436
That's the whole point.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.039
I'm thinkin' about stoppin'
the medication.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.610
<i>Are you fucking crazy?</i>

40:14.946 --> 40:17.080
<i>Well, excuse me.</i>

40:17.082 --> 40:19.082
You are fucking crazy.

40:20.285 --> 40:22.118
No, Henry..

40:22.120 --> 40:23.953
That is not
what we're going to do.

40:25.257 --> 40:29.058
- Adam, you should be in bed.
- Adam, it's okay.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.027
Come on in, please.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.295
You're welcome.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.832
It's nice to see you again.

40:35.834 --> 40:39.302
Oh, I don't think I ever
taught him to shake hands.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.204
Alright. Right there.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.773
Okay.. Oh, okay. Okay, yep.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.675
Big strong hands.

40:45.677 --> 40:49.579
Alright, that's.. I see
you've got him on hormones.

40:49.581 --> 40:52.615
HGH. I wanna see how strong
he can get.

40:52.617 --> 40:55.852
You know, with everything
else he's got goin' on.

40:55.854 --> 40:58.988
- And?
- See for yourself.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.290
Hm.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.535
You know I think you should
let me take him out for a spin.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.003
Give him some air, some culture.

41:14.005 --> 41:17.240
You're always talking about
the importance of the brain.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.875
Do you think
we should be filling this one

41:18.877 --> 41:20.877
with something worthwhile?

41:36.828 --> 41:39.195
I want him back by 6:00,
before dark.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.664
<i>Look at you. You're so cute.</i>

41:41.666 --> 41:42.899
You're a prick.

41:42.901 --> 41:45.735
Maybe so, but you got to
let go sometime.

41:45.737 --> 41:48.738
Come on, Adam.
It's gonna be fun.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.841
<i>That looks good on you.</i>

41:59.784 --> 42:01.317
Don't worry.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.454
Come on.

42:04.456 --> 42:06.222
Let's take a selfie.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.126
Why so serious? Come on, smile.

42:11.897 --> 42:13.229
<i>Welcome to Manhattan, Adam.</i>

42:56.174 --> 42:58.908
Okay. Come on.

43:01.046 --> 43:03.880
Recognize this place, Adam?

43:03.882 --> 43:05.548
<i>I believe you should.</i>

43:11.056 --> 43:12.388
Come on.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.959
<i>And so it begins.</i>

43:15.961 --> 43:18.194
<i>I don't suppose Henry's
had the time to teach you</i>

43:18.196 --> 43:20.663
<i>the history of things
but allow me to summarize.</i>

43:20.665 --> 43:23.833
<i>Since the beginning
it's been war and warring</i>

43:23.835 --> 43:27.437
<i>with factions of artists trying
to find beauty and meaning.</i>

43:27.439 --> 43:29.973
Capture the agony
and the ecstasy.

43:29.975 --> 43:34.143
This museum, it's a mausoleum

43:34.145 --> 43:36.446
<i>to the aspirations of man.</i>

43:36.448 --> 43:41.184
Nice aspirations on him,
don't you think, Adam?

43:43.888 --> 43:46.189
<i>"The Divine Comedy."</i>

43:46.191 --> 43:49.325
<i>Should Ugolino
have eaten his offspring?</i>

43:49.327 --> 43:51.828
<i>It's all about choices.</i>

43:51.830 --> 43:53.363
<i>Some would say
choice is an illusion.</i>

43:53.365 --> 43:56.132
<i>I prefer to give it some credit.</i>

43:56.134 --> 43:59.969
<i>The choices we make
define the man.</i>

44:05.510 --> 44:07.076
Come on.

44:12.917 --> 44:16.085
The Rape of the Sabine Women.

44:16.087 --> 44:18.021
I thought you'd like
this one, Adam.

44:18.023 --> 44:20.323
<i>Filled with an action.</i>

44:20.325 --> 44:22.592
<i>Those women were tricked</i>

44:22.594 --> 44:25.228
<i>and can't be trusted.</i>

44:25.230 --> 44:26.796
Terrible.

44:27.666 --> 44:31.434
<i>Principles, justice, honor.</i>

44:31.436 --> 44:32.802
Some would die for them.

44:32.804 --> 44:36.139
While others
are a bit more shrewd.

44:36.141 --> 44:39.142
<i>This, this is what
they teach you</i>

44:39.144 --> 44:41.477
<i>in the institutes
of higher learning, Adam.</i>

44:41.479 --> 44:43.312
<i>A lot of useless knowledge</i>

44:43.314 --> 44:46.382
that nobody gives
a fuck about anymore.

44:46.384 --> 44:50.186
I did meet my darling wife
in college.

44:50.188 --> 44:53.356
Don't get me wrong,
there are some perks.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.491
She was very rich.

44:56.294 --> 44:58.428
C... cloud.

44:58.430 --> 45:01.264
Hm... yes, it is.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.701
<i>How do you see the world, Adam?</i>

45:04.703 --> 45:07.704
<i>Do you see great swirls
like Van Gogh?</i>

45:08.707 --> 45:10.640
<i>He died in poverty.</i>

45:10.642 --> 45:13.209
He went mad
and cut his own ear off.

45:18.583 --> 45:21.617
Modernity encroaches.

45:21.619 --> 45:23.619
20th century angst.

45:24.789 --> 45:27.123
<i>God is dead
and we are left alone</i>

45:27.125 --> 45:30.693
<i>with our technology
and our nightmares.</i>

45:30.695 --> 45:33.696
<i>It is the beginning of the end.</i>

45:33.698 --> 45:37.300
<i>A culture of narcissism
and self indulgence</i>

45:37.302 --> 45:41.137
born out of the comforts
of modern life.

45:41.139 --> 45:45.374
<i>All that's left to do
is enjoy the ride.</i>

45:50.482 --> 45:53.816
<i>This is my favorite place
in the museum.</i>

45:54.986 --> 45:58.554
<i>Here we have artistry
and science</i>

45:58.556 --> 46:00.456
<i>directly engaged</i>

46:00.458 --> 46:03.259
<i>with man's essential impulse..</i>

46:03.862 --> 46:05.728
<i>Violence.</i>

46:05.730 --> 46:07.697
<i>These are instruments of death.</i>

46:07.699 --> 46:10.900
<i>Look how lovingly crafted.</i>

46:10.902 --> 46:13.536
<i>From the blade to the balm</i>

46:13.538 --> 46:17.006
<i>humanity does so love
destruction.</i>

46:19.010 --> 46:20.176
Depraved.

46:21.379 --> 46:24.847
That's what we are, Adam.
Utterly depraved.

46:34.692 --> 46:36.459
<i>Souvenir of our visit.</i>

46:37.562 --> 46:40.229
You always have to have
a souvenir, Adam.

46:40.231 --> 46:42.532
Speaking of memories, does, um

46:42.534 --> 46:45.301
anything here look familiar?

46:48.907 --> 46:50.740
Have you worked here long?

46:50.742 --> 46:52.942
Um, for a while, yeah.

46:55.246 --> 46:56.246
Thanks.

46:57.148 --> 46:58.781
Thank you.

47:08.927 --> 47:12.161
<i>Come on, Adam.
It's not polite to stare.</i>

47:44.896 --> 47:46.796
Hi, ladies.

47:47.298 --> 47:48.965
Melania.

47:50.568 --> 47:52.802
Ermez.

47:52.804 --> 47:54.470
Hi, baby.

48:06.184 --> 48:07.850
Get us two whiskeys.

48:14.659 --> 48:16.058
Come on, Adam.

48:17.662 --> 48:19.862
This is my friend, Adam.

48:19.864 --> 48:21.898
Adam, this is the lovely Stormi.

48:23.534 --> 48:26.869
Thank you, my love.

48:26.871 --> 48:28.137
<i>Salut.</i>

48:32.844 --> 48:35.378
Don't worry, it gets better
with the second one.

48:43.821 --> 48:45.321
<i>You like her?</i>

48:51.429 --> 48:53.429
You do like her, don't you?

48:57.468 --> 48:59.869
<i>Do you know any girls, Adam?</i>

48:59.871 --> 49:01.304
I know Liz.

49:02.307 --> 49:05.541
You do know Liz.
Let's get closer.

49:18.022 --> 49:19.455
Give those to her.

50:07.238 --> 50:08.671
Mm-hm.

50:11.809 --> 50:15.144
We're gonna spend a lot more
time together, you and I, Adam.

50:18.816 --> 50:20.716
Henry's not well.

50:22.053 --> 50:24.387
There is one thing
I want you to promise me.

50:25.656 --> 50:27.556
If he ever stops giving you
your medication

50:27.558 --> 50:29.592
you know,
the... the... the Rap-X?

50:29.594 --> 50:31.560
It's the little red pills?

50:32.563 --> 50:35.564
You find them and you take them.

50:35.566 --> 50:37.833
Three tablets a day
and you never stop.

50:37.835 --> 50:39.435
Do you understand?

50:41.105 --> 50:42.538
Good.

50:42.540 --> 50:44.707
He may not care about you..

50:45.576 --> 50:47.243
But I do.

50:53.317 --> 50:55.985
That's the funny thing
about fathers.

50:58.089 --> 51:00.556
So few of 'em are in it
for the long haul.

51:11.602 --> 51:14.136
<i>Do you know what a lie is, Adam?</i>

51:16.541 --> 51:19.241
<i>A lie is something
that's spoken that is not true.</i>

51:20.812 --> 51:23.079
<i>A lie can hurt
as much as a knife wound</i>

51:23.081 --> 51:26.582
<i>if it's wielded with as much
care and purpose.</i>

51:28.252 --> 51:31.087
Sometimes it's those
who are closest to us who lie.

51:40.698 --> 51:41.964
You like her.

52:00.585 --> 52:02.384
Good morning, Henry.

52:03.154 --> 52:05.354
Come on, Adam.

52:05.356 --> 52:06.422
Attaboy.

52:06.424 --> 52:08.057
Where the hell were you?

52:08.059 --> 52:10.726
We were out on the town.

52:10.728 --> 52:13.596
All night? Never again.

52:13.598 --> 52:15.197
You know, I must've been out
of my fuckin' mind.

52:15.199 --> 52:18.167
Yeah, sometimes I think
you might be.

52:18.169 --> 52:20.836
- What did you give him?
- Ah, don't worry about it.

52:20.838 --> 52:22.271
He'll sweat it out.

52:22.273 --> 52:24.740
Don't be such a fuckin' Puritan.

52:24.742 --> 52:26.809
I called you seven times.

52:26.811 --> 52:30.613
Yeah, well now you know
what it feels like.

52:30.615 --> 52:34.049
- This isn't a fuckin' game!
- No, I understand that.

52:34.051 --> 52:37.586
Hey, listen I... I... I
just wanna tell you something

52:37.588 --> 52:39.455
because he's your patient.

52:40.558 --> 52:42.124
What, what?
What do you wanna say?

52:42.126 --> 52:43.759
Well, it's just, uh..

52:44.996 --> 52:47.563
I think he might be
a little volatile.

52:47.565 --> 52:50.733
Some of his behavior
was slightly erratic.

52:50.735 --> 52:52.168
Yeah, he's probably reacting

52:52.170 --> 52:54.270
to whatever the fuck
you put him through.

52:54.272 --> 52:56.539
You and your whole scene, man,
just lookin' for excitement.

52:56.541 --> 52:59.141
You don't know the first
fuckin' thing about excitement.

53:00.144 --> 53:03.979
Look, he said something
about Liz..

53:03.981 --> 53:07.216
So I figured maybe you
should keep an eye out.

53:07.218 --> 53:09.318
- What?
- Nothing.

53:09.320 --> 53:10.553
Nothing, it was just the fact

53:10.555 --> 53:11.987
that it came
so fucking out of the blue.

53:11.989 --> 53:13.522
I thought you should know.

53:14.492 --> 53:17.393
Ask him. Look, I got to go.

53:38.849 --> 53:40.849
Come on, let's go inside.

53:57.602 --> 54:00.402
Hello.

54:01.706 --> 54:03.706
It's me, Liz.

54:04.508 --> 54:06.175
I remember.

54:08.779 --> 54:10.379
I'm Adam.

54:11.983 --> 54:14.450
Um, did I wake you?

54:18.889 --> 54:22.224
Um, I wanted to know..

54:22.860 --> 54:26.862
How you... feel.

54:27.832 --> 54:29.365
Feel?

54:32.036 --> 54:33.235
I..

54:34.639 --> 54:37.039
I feel with my hand.

54:41.579 --> 54:42.845
Buttons.

54:42.847 --> 54:45.247
Oh, mm.

54:50.288 --> 54:51.920
I, uh..

54:54.358 --> 54:56.358
I was wondering..

54:57.828 --> 55:01.830
Is any... body asking you..

55:06.771 --> 55:08.671
Do you have any..

55:14.378 --> 55:16.045
Pain?

55:17.782 --> 55:19.181
Pain?

55:22.053 --> 55:23.619
Pain.

55:26.290 --> 55:27.623
Yes.

55:29.660 --> 55:31.727
I have pain.

55:38.502 --> 55:39.635
Oh.

55:44.408 --> 55:47.810
What do you do here all day
when Henry's not around?

55:47.812 --> 55:50.279
<i>I read books.</i>

55:50.281 --> 55:53.649
<i>I wait for Henry to come
and play ping pong with me.</i>

55:55.319 --> 56:00.622
In my... dreams,
um I'm someone else.

56:01.726 --> 56:04.593
<i>I don't understand
how I got here.</i>

56:04.595 --> 56:06.395
<i>What's goin' on here?</i>

56:07.431 --> 56:09.565
Henry.

56:09.567 --> 56:12.701
<i>Liz, you can't just keep
barging in here.</i>

56:12.703 --> 56:15.371
Well, he was all alone.

56:15.373 --> 56:18.774
You're not gonna fix him.
You're not gonna fix me.

56:20.244 --> 56:23.445
Jesus Christ, Henry,
what a fucking mess you've made.

56:23.447 --> 56:26.615
<i>Don't talk to me like that.
What I've done here is amazing.</i>

56:26.617 --> 56:28.784
Oh, really?

56:28.786 --> 56:31.053
And who can you tell about
this spectacular accomplishment

56:31.055 --> 56:32.321
<i>without being thrown in jail?</i>

56:32.323 --> 56:33.355
Fuck that!

56:33.357 --> 56:34.390
You don't think that they would

56:34.392 --> 56:36.759
fall all over themselves
to protect me

56:36.761 --> 56:38.160
<i>after they found out
what I've done?</i>

56:38.162 --> 56:41.797
They? They, they.
Who the fuck is they?

56:41.799 --> 56:43.432
Who can you even trust
with this?

56:43.434 --> 56:44.933
My God, shut up.
Shut the fuck...

56:44.935 --> 56:46.235
Can you repeat what you've done?

56:46.237 --> 56:48.303
- What?
- Is it verifiable?

56:48.305 --> 56:50.272
<i>- It's in the computer.
- Would anybody even let you?</i>

56:50.274 --> 56:52.674
- Stop!
- Henry, you are not well.

56:52.676 --> 56:54.443
Ever since I've met you

56:54.445 --> 56:57.179
you have been trying to save
everyone that you meet

56:57.181 --> 56:58.647
but you know what?

56:58.649 --> 57:02.217
Therapy and kindness
can't fix everything. Alright?

57:02.219 --> 57:04.353
<i>You get your fuckin' leg
blown off</i>

57:04.355 --> 57:07.356
<i>you need more than
a bedside manner to fix it!</i>

57:07.358 --> 57:08.924
<i>It takes innovation.</i>

57:08.926 --> 57:11.126
Blood and guts, innovation.

57:11.128 --> 57:14.263
This is not you talking. This
is Polidori manipulating you.

57:14.265 --> 57:17.332
Stop! You have always been
jealous of him, it's ridiculous.

57:17.334 --> 57:20.202
Jealous? Jealous that he can get
you to do anything he wants.

57:20.204 --> 57:23.839
What about me, huh?
What about what I have done?

57:23.841 --> 57:25.107
<i>What I have achieved?</i>

57:25.109 --> 57:27.609
I see nothing here but sadness.

57:27.611 --> 57:31.313
<i>Don't, don't say that
in front of Adam.</i>

57:31.315 --> 57:35.951
Henry, please.
Please, just come to the clinic.

57:35.953 --> 57:37.319
There are so many vets
down there

57:37.321 --> 57:40.355
who could use
your compassion, your smarts.

57:40.357 --> 57:42.458
Yes, of course. I want to but..

57:43.561 --> 57:45.661
If you think that Polidori
cares about you

57:45.663 --> 57:49.798
<i>or about Adam or anybody
but himself, you're wrong.</i>

57:49.800 --> 57:53.268
<i>Get out now, please.
This isn't needed here.</i>

58:22.933 --> 58:24.533
I've been wrong.

58:25.903 --> 58:27.836
I realize that..

58:29.073 --> 58:34.009
I owe you something
like a normal life..

58:34.945 --> 58:36.945
Where you can come and go.

58:40.818 --> 58:42.484
I didn't think it through.

58:43.621 --> 58:47.389
I didn't believe
that you would ever..

58:49.193 --> 58:51.727
Understand
what was happening to you.

58:54.131 --> 58:55.297
Maybe I didn't want to.

58:55.299 --> 58:57.966
I want a girl
like you have a girl.

58:59.169 --> 59:02.137
- What?
- Lonely.

59:05.910 --> 59:07.576
Right, of course.

59:08.979 --> 59:10.646
I understand.

59:12.917 --> 59:15.551
Is that what you and Liz
were talkin' about?

59:18.355 --> 59:19.555
No.

59:21.258 --> 59:22.858
You don't have to lie to me,
Adam.

59:22.860 --> 59:24.626
I know that she's..

59:25.963 --> 59:27.963
She's very kind.

59:30.467 --> 59:32.067
Lie.

59:35.172 --> 59:36.505
<i>It's only a matter of time</i>

59:36.507 --> 59:38.340
<i>till we all have to start
getting ready</i>

59:38.342 --> 59:39.374
<i>for doomsday, you know?</i>

59:39.376 --> 59:41.443
<i>Even if it's trans-misogyny</i>

59:41.445 --> 59:43.011
<i>the qualifications require..</i>

59:45.249 --> 59:46.682
<i>Valentine's Day may be over</i>

59:46.684 --> 59:49.117
<i>but you can always
give a smoochy cake..</i>

59:49.119 --> 59:50.852
<i>Northern and Southern California</i>

59:50.854 --> 59:52.854
<i>still dealing
with the, the fire storms.</i>

59:52.856 --> 59:55.157
<i>I'm opposed
to shutting down your speech.</i>

59:55.159 --> 59:57.125
<i>You know you have to have
that objection..</i>

59:57.127 --> 01:00:00.228
<i>It's not the solution,
the government is the problem.</i>

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.530
<i>Now in this..</i>

01:00:01.532 --> 01:00:04.399
<i>Can Bill and Margo win
the $10,000?</i>

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:06.868
<i>Ask your doctor
if Doraphine is right for you.</i>

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:10.072
<i>Side effects include bleeding,
nausea and in some patients.</i>

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:13.175
<i>Doraphine has been known to
cause heart failure and death.</i>

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:15.177
<i>Discontinue use..</i>

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.199
Drugs.

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:14.036
Medicine.

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:18.440
Don't need 'em.

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:21.743
We don't need them... anymore.

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:25.013
You, uh... you got better.

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:30.385
Red pills.

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:32.187
Three a day.

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:36.158
Nope.

01:01:38.062 --> 01:01:39.761
You're good.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:49.371
Adam, I wanna give you
somethin'.

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:08.890
I want you to have this.

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:15.497
And I want you to know..

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:17.699
That charm..

01:02:17.701 --> 01:02:19.701
That means this was a gift.

01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:24.139
That means you were loved.

01:02:58.075 --> 01:03:01.143
Hit the ball to you,
hit it with the paddle.

01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:02.511
Okay?

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:08.183
Okay, let's see if this works.

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:09.551
Okay.

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:55.630
Open the goddamn door.

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:56.965
Where did you get him?

01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:59.367
Paramedic buddy of mine in Dumbo

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:01.603
gave me a call,
knew I was looking.

01:04:02.773 --> 01:04:05.640
God, it's still warm.
How did you do that?

01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:08.443
Henry? Door.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:11.947
<i>Time of death, 10:48.</i>

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.648
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:17.719
<i>I'm gonna start prepping
the instruments.</i>

01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:19.955
<i>We got to get that brain
outta there, alright?</i>

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:45.347
<i>Henry?</i>

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:47.382
<i>Okay, stay there.
Stay there, alright?</i>

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:55.590
Alright, stay there.
And my best friend.

01:04:56.894 --> 01:04:58.226
This guy.

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:01.263
Okay.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.473
<i>Hello?</i>

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:14.376
<i>Alex?</i>

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:17.045
<i>Alex?</i>

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.515
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:22.017
<i>Oh, my God, who is this?</i>

01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:23.718
No!

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:33.461
<i>Whoa! Whoa-oh!</i>

01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:36.798
- Speak of the devil!
- Adam, stand back.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.234
Okay, Henry, in... introduce
your friend to the guys.

01:05:39.236 --> 01:05:41.603
This is proof that Rap-X works.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:42.904
Adam..

01:05:43.874 --> 01:05:47.575
- I know what you did.
- What?

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.177
- And you!
- Okay, come on!

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:51.246
Come on, come on!

01:05:51.248 --> 01:05:52.380
<i>Adam!</i>

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:13.935
<i>Adam!</i>

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:21.242
<i>Adam!</i>

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.088
Guys, I'm so glad
you could come.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.924
Look, the one thing I need you
to understand about all of this

01:06:35.926 --> 01:06:37.625
is that,
is that it's an anomaly.

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:40.695
This was not a situation
that has happened before.

01:06:42.766 --> 01:06:44.632
I'm sure you understand
that in the course

01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:46.701
of a clinical trial
every so often you hit a...

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:48.503
Look, I don't know what the hell
happened back there

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.206
but you're crazy
if you think it's ready.

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:54.909
Okay, guys, look, I'll,
I'll give you a call next..

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:03.952
<i>Well?</i>

01:07:03.954 --> 01:07:07.222
I couldn't find him but he,
he can't have gotten far.

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:09.190
Fuck!

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.827
<i>Henry, I am sorry, I've got
too much riding on this.</i>

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.195
<i>I cannot let you fuck it up.</i>

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:16.531
<i>Do you ever get tired
of stating the obvious</i>

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:19.034
<i>you asshole?
It's all ready fucked up!</i>

01:07:19.036 --> 01:07:21.736
<i>No, no, in fact the only thing
that's gone wrong so far</i>

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:23.805
<i>is that you've introduced
unnecessary drama</i>

01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:25.907
into this situation.

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:28.076
Look, you haven't been firm
with Adam

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:31.379
and that has made him feel
unsafe and uncomfortable.

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:35.183
You don't know the first fuckin'
thing about what Adam needs.

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:37.352
He needs calm and stability.

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:40.555
The brain cannot heal itself
in an erratic environment.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:44.325
Okay, okay. Well you know
what I fucking need, Henry?

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:48.063
I need this thing to start
paying off... now.

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:50.698
This is a trial period still.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.567
- No!
- You need to accept that.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:56.905
No! It's not, Henry!
It's not a trial period.

01:07:56.907 --> 01:07:59.641
It has been 30 goddamn days.

01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:03.778
The trial
is a rousing success, man.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:07.282
It worked. Congratulations.

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:10.752
Look, I got to go.

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:14.522
Just so you know,
I... I... I took

01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:16.291
the laptop and the hard drives.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:17.826
What?

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:20.562
John, you can't just do that.

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:23.198
I'm sure you remember
the agreement we made

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.532
where this is all my property.

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:28.136
Come on, man, don't turn
this whole fuckin' experience

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:30.872
into just some thing you did
for SynTech.

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:33.541
Oh.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.710
Fuck you.

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:38.813
Look, I... I was there, man.
I was in the room.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.415
You needed my help.

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:43.051
You didn't do this without me.
You couldn't do this without me.

01:08:43.053 --> 01:08:47.055
Yes, yes, John.
We did this together.

01:08:47.057 --> 01:08:50.758
Look just call me
if Adam shows back up.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.161
Okay?

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.930
I... I got to go, uh..

01:08:55.932 --> 01:08:58.867
Sort shit out with the suits.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:01.102
And I got to be upstate
for the weekend but after that...

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:05.506
- Adam is not ready.
- Look, Adam's not even here.

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:06.741
Look, I'll be back on Monday.

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:09.777
He better fucking be back
before then.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:11.045
John.

01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:14.015
John!

01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:17.218
John!

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:36.404
Liz, it's me. I..

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.773
Adam's gone missing.
I'm out looking for him.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:41.743
But... if he goes back
to the loft

01:09:41.745 --> 01:09:44.379
could you just be there?

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:46.346
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:48.216
Just call me.

01:11:27.217 --> 01:11:30.852
<i>Hey, bud?
You havin' a drink or what?</i>

01:11:30.854 --> 01:11:32.253
Whiskey.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.890
<i>Top shelf, house, rocks?</i>

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:38.026
Yes.

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:47.168
<i>Eight bucks.</i>

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:15.797
<i>Hey, Sam, I'll get the next one.</i>

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:21.269
Hi.

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:27.275
You fucked up?

01:12:27.277 --> 01:12:29.377
You look fucked up.

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:30.745
But I wanted to buy you
a whiskey 'cause when you

01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:33.181
walked in here
you reminded me of Iggy Pop.

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:37.051
You know who Iggy Pop is?

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:39.454
Because that's the shit, man.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.657
Here, you gonna drink this?

01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:45.126
Come on, toast.

01:12:46.429 --> 01:12:48.896
Raise your glass, man.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:58.206
I'm Shelley.

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:01.008
- What's your name?
- Iggy.

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:08.716
Just so you know I've done every
puzzle in this place already

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:11.953
so... don't try
any funny business.

01:13:21.131 --> 01:13:23.197
So what happened to you?

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:25.566
I mean, Iggy,
those are a lot of scars.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:27.735
Is that your real name?

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:29.637
I like music.

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:33.975
Cool. I do too.

01:13:33.977 --> 01:13:35.343
What kinda music you into?

01:13:35.345 --> 01:13:37.278
Do you like "The Stooges?"

01:13:39.349 --> 01:13:41.783
Gravity is your friend.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.086
Yeah.

01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:49.991
Never thought about it
like that.

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:53.461
So you gonna tell me
what happened to you?

01:13:53.463 --> 01:13:55.663
You don't have to answer that
but I really want you to.

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:57.932
You have a tattoo.
I have a tattoo.

01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:59.734
Oh, yeah? Yeah,
I've got a lot of tattoos.

01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:01.402
But you're not gonna
see 'em all tonight.

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:03.104
I have this tattoo.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:06.441
Wow.

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:10.111
Wait, what is that?
That's, um, Caduceus, right?

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:12.280
- It means like rebirth?
- I don't know.

01:14:13.316 --> 01:14:15.216
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:16.818
Oh, come on, you don't know
what it means?

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.287
- No.
- Oh.

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:22.190
I've had nights like that too.

01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:24.525
Thank God, I never got
a tattoo though.

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:29.797
But what about the scars, Iggy?

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:31.399
Are you into like scarring
and shit?

01:14:31.401 --> 01:14:33.768
I mean, that's some crazy shit.

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:41.375
Okay, what do you say,
one more round?

01:15:16.913 --> 01:15:18.479
Alright, that's it, I'm broke.

01:15:18.481 --> 01:15:21.048
Sam's so cheap.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:23.584
He won't give me a free one
unless I'm here the whole night.

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:25.653
Did you just..

01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:27.555
So you're good at puzzles.

01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:34.695
And you're pretty quiet.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.163
You're pretty weird.

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:39.166
What are you even doing
around here?

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:42.937
I walked here.

01:15:44.274 --> 01:15:46.040
Yeah? You live around here?

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:48.209
I mean, I've never seen you
before, I'd remember.

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.378
I don't go outside,
I stay inside.

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.980
Mm, hm, no wonder,
I mean, you're so pale.

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:56.450
I mean... what are you,
like a vampire or something?

01:15:56.452 --> 01:15:57.752
I don't know.

01:15:58.922 --> 01:16:01.322
Oh, well, that probably means
you are one.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:07.995
Shit.
It's getting pretty late, huh?

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:09.397
I got to work tomorrow.

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:13.134
Fuckin' corporate slog.

01:16:13.136 --> 01:16:15.036
I know you wouldn't guess it
by looking at me, huh?

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:17.572
But, yeah, just a cog in the
wheel. What are you gonna do?

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:20.107
Problem is,
I can't ever sleep at night

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:21.876
so I got to come here every night
and slam a couple.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:24.478
- You know what I mean?
- Yep.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.081
Wow, you are pretty funny.
What do you do?

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:31.085
Play ping-pong.

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:37.325
You're drunk.

01:16:38.027 --> 01:16:40.061
Or... you're just nuts.

01:16:40.063 --> 01:16:42.463
I don't know,
but I'm pretty drunk.

01:16:42.465 --> 01:16:44.065
Ooh, yeah, I got to go.

01:16:44.067 --> 01:16:45.266
You gonna stay?

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:47.535
I have nowhere to go.

01:16:47.537 --> 01:16:49.203
What? I thought you said
you lived around here.

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:50.338
<i>No.</i>

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.006
Huh.

01:16:53.343 --> 01:16:54.709
Well, I guess
you can walk me home.

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:57.111
I did buy you all those drinks.

01:16:58.514 --> 01:17:00.214
Whoo, it's so cold!

01:17:02.719 --> 01:17:05.686
I live this way a lotta blocks.

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:09.490
Man... you are really out there.

01:17:09.492 --> 01:17:12.360
- Are you high?
- I like you.

01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:14.795
Yeah?

01:17:15.565 --> 01:17:17.732
That's cute, I guess.

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:19.834
You can walk me home, I guess.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.806
You wanna hold my hand?

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:28.309
Weird.

01:17:32.615 --> 01:17:34.215
I can't believe it rained
and then now

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:36.584
it's just freezing cold
and there's no snow.

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:39.987
Rain's only worth rain
if it's gonna turn into snow

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.589
you know what I mean?

01:17:41.591 --> 01:17:43.624
Anyway, this is me.
Thanks for walkin' me.

01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:47.028
- Uh, come this way.
- You live down there?

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:49.630
I thought it was just a bunch
of warehouses down there.

01:17:49.632 --> 01:17:50.831
Anyway, I can't,
I got to go home.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.267
- Come, ping pong.
- Oh, yeah, ping pong.

01:17:53.269 --> 01:17:54.502
- Not tonight. I got to go home.
- No, come!

01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:55.803
- Meet Henry.
- Hey!

01:17:55.805 --> 01:17:57.405
Hey, Iggy, what are you doing?
Or whatever your name..

01:17:57.407 --> 01:17:59.440
- Come! Come!
- What are you doing?

01:18:01.611 --> 01:18:03.010
Come on!

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:06.380
Please! Let me go! Please!

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.217
Adam?

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:45.820
Adam?

01:18:45.822 --> 01:18:48.622
Adam, oh, my God,
what did you do?

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.326
Come on,
we have to get her upstairs.

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:54.628
Up... upstairs now!

01:18:57.967 --> 01:18:59.500
Hold her. Come on.

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:04.271
Lay her out!

01:19:10.747 --> 01:19:12.113
Shelley?

01:19:12.515 --> 01:19:13.981
Shelley?

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:22.556
No, no. It's... it's too late.

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:26.360
I want her to be my girl.
Give her medicine.

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:29.463
- Did you do this?
- Shelley, my girl!

01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:32.433
No, No!
Don't you fucking get it?

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:34.835
She's been dead for hours.
I.. It doesn't work.

01:19:34.837 --> 01:19:37.271
Medicine!
Bring her back like me!

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:38.939
- No, I can't! It's too late.
- Shelley!

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:41.809
I know you can fix her!

01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:11.172
You know what's happening?

01:20:11.174 --> 01:20:12.807
You don't really exist.

01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:15.309
There's no record of you.
There's no prints.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.645
You're nothing that can be
traced to anything.

01:20:17.647 --> 01:20:19.113
You understand me?

01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:21.148
You're not in the system.

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.683
You're not real.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:27.087
I'm sorry. It's over.

01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:40.835
We can tomorrow. We still got
tomorrow. We got tomorrow.

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:42.136
<i>We got tomorrow.</i>

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:05.793
Shoot!

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:28.048
You're gonna be okay, alright?
I brought you back.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:31.485
- What's your name?
- Adam.

01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:33.020
Alright, Adam.
You're gonna be okay.

01:21:33.022 --> 01:21:35.789
I got you, okay? Hang on.

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:46.567
Come on!

01:21:58.547 --> 01:22:00.147
<i>Oh, God, Henry, what's happened?</i>

01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:02.416
<i>I just got your messages.</i>

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:03.684
I got to get outta here.

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.352
Oh, my God.

01:22:05.354 --> 01:22:07.121
What have you done to Adam?

01:22:09.725 --> 01:22:11.992
- Who is she?
- I... I... I... don't know.

01:22:11.994 --> 01:22:14.828
I don't know where he went
or who he talked to or

01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:17.364
or, or if anyone's gonna be
looking for her.

01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:19.667
I'm gonna bury him
in Polidori's backyard.

01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:21.969
Then he and Adam can be
together. Just how he wants it.

01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:24.204
Wow, what a fucking mess
you've made.

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:30.077
<i>Why didn't I remember?</i>

01:22:31.681 --> 01:22:32.681
<i>Remember what?</i>

01:22:33.683 --> 01:22:38.085
<i>Why don't I remember
being small?</i>

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:49.263
<i>Well, you had a trauma.</i>

01:22:52.101 --> 01:22:53.667
<i>That's what we're dealin' with.</i>

01:23:05.181 --> 01:23:10.050
<i>I'm gonna drive north
and I'll call you when I can.</i>

01:23:10.052 --> 01:23:13.020
<i>Shit. You... you... you can't
drive, you can't even stand.</i>

01:23:13.022 --> 01:23:17.958
<i>No! I will drive. I will drive.
You get in the car.</i>

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.294
<i>Drop me off at the train
and then you're on your own.</i>

01:23:24.266 --> 01:23:25.733
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:23:30.006 --> 01:23:32.940
<i>When you're in the field,
every kid that comes in</i>

01:23:32.942 --> 01:23:36.643
<i>with his arm blown off
or his head smashed in</i>

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:40.447
<i>you want to help him.
Give him an arm and a new leg.</i>

01:23:40.449 --> 01:23:43.851
<i>You wish you could bring them
all back</i>

01:23:43.853 --> 01:23:45.285
<i>and send them home
to their wives.</i>

01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:47.821
<i>Their... their moms, their kids.</i>

01:23:47.823 --> 01:23:49.790
<i>Well, I figured it out.</i>

01:23:49.792 --> 01:23:54.261
<i>I figured out how
to bring them back.</i>

01:23:54.263 --> 01:23:56.063
Adam.

01:24:02.805 --> 01:24:05.339
<i>I told Polidori what I'd been
doing in the battlefield</i>

01:24:05.341 --> 01:24:07.941
<i>and he got very excited
and he set me up in a loft.</i>

01:24:07.943 --> 01:24:10.611
<i>He told me people
from SynTech would support me.</i>

01:24:10.613 --> 01:24:12.513
<i>He could supply
the pharmaceuticals</i>

01:24:12.515 --> 01:24:15.949
<i>if I incorporated the Rap-X.</i>

01:24:15.951 --> 01:24:18.285
<i>He said he could supply
the body parts too</i>

01:24:18.287 --> 01:24:21.121
<i>donated to Sanford Medical
and I figured that</i>

01:24:21.123 --> 01:24:23.557
<i>that was probably legit
'cause he's been on staff there</i>

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:27.161
<i>for years, you know?
But I... I didn't care.</i>

01:24:27.163 --> 01:24:29.096
<i>I wanted the body parts.</i>

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:44.445
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:45.979
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:24:50.486 --> 01:24:52.453
- What the fuck is that?
- Just dump it.

01:24:52.455 --> 01:24:56.790
I feel sick,
thinking about that girl.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.726
<i>Her parents and her friends</i>

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:02.362
<i>wondering what happened to her.</i>

01:25:07.103 --> 01:25:09.169
<i>Wait there! I'll bring it.</i>

01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:30.557
Alright, that's it.

01:25:32.094 --> 01:25:34.361
It's about a half mile up
to the house.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:39.066
<i>If he ever fucks with me..</i>

01:25:40.503 --> 01:25:42.369
I'll just tell him
to take a look down here.

01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:03.557
It's a good piece of meat.

01:26:03.559 --> 01:26:06.827
Is it dry? Might be a bit dry.

01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:10.631
Hm. No, mine is fantastic.

01:26:10.633 --> 01:26:12.833
How 'bout yours, Mr. Beaufort?
How was it?

01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:16.136
It was fine, John.
Maybe a bit overcooked.

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:25.445
So, I hear tell
that we're thinking

01:26:25.447 --> 01:26:28.081
about raising the price
of Doraphine.

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:29.149
We're looking into it.

01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:30.751
It was severely under priced

01:26:30.753 --> 01:26:31.885
when we introduced it.

01:26:31.887 --> 01:26:34.087
<i>It's a proportionate adjustment.</i>

01:26:34.089 --> 01:26:35.522
<i>Shouldn't cause much of a stir.</i>

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:38.192
No, it shouldn't,
it's, it's astonishing

01:26:38.194 --> 01:26:40.427
how people think
that R and D is free.

01:26:41.897 --> 01:26:44.831
Hm, that's why
I've been doing so much of my

01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:47.734
my own due diligence on Rap X.

01:26:47.736 --> 01:26:50.771
Your preoccupation with Rap X
is misplaced.

01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:54.107
<i>It's a long way from market
and the application is obscure.</i>

01:26:54.109 --> 01:26:56.243
<i>I'd like to see you
put your focus elsewhere.</i>

01:26:59.081 --> 01:27:01.215
Sure, but that... that
could change

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:04.685
with the right data. Correct?

01:27:04.687 --> 01:27:05.919
Dad, you're not here to just

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:08.555
go on about SynTech business
over dinner.

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:10.557
John brought it up.

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.226
<i>Uh, we should put coffee on
if we're going to do</i>

01:27:12.228 --> 01:27:14.094
<i>the drive back
to the city after dinner.</i>

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:15.929
Oh, well, let me get dessert.

01:27:15.931 --> 01:27:18.065
- Uh, no need for dessert, dear.
- Oh, no, I got it...

01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:20.767
Uh, uh, just coffee
and we'll be fine.

01:27:20.769 --> 01:27:22.302
Are you sure you won't spend
the night, mother?

01:27:22.304 --> 01:27:24.471
It'll be much more pleasant.

01:27:24.473 --> 01:27:26.173
Yes, we'll have brandy.

01:27:28.244 --> 01:27:30.043
How fast can you pour, John?

01:27:30.045 --> 01:27:31.478
Coming right up.

01:27:37.353 --> 01:27:38.585
Who is that?

01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:40.954
<i>Having company at this hour?</i>

01:27:45.361 --> 01:27:47.594
I don't know who that could be.

01:27:48.731 --> 01:27:53.333
Henry. Liz.
What are you doing here?

01:27:53.335 --> 01:27:55.202
Hey.
Hope we're not interrupting.

01:27:55.204 --> 01:27:57.838
Henry. Liz. This is a surprise.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.406
Well, we were
in the neighborhood.

01:27:59.408 --> 01:28:01.208
Apparently.
You must be freezing.

01:28:01.210 --> 01:28:03.944
- Who is it?
- Uh, daddy, you remember Henry.

01:28:03.946 --> 01:28:07.547
- We went to school together.
- Yes, Henry. I remember.

01:28:07.549 --> 01:28:10.884
You went to the Mid East didn't
you? Triage, couple of medals?

01:28:10.886 --> 01:28:13.820
- Yes.
- It's a damn mess over there.

01:28:13.822 --> 01:28:16.123
- Yes, sir, it is.
- And not getting any better.

01:28:16.125 --> 01:28:20.694
Let's not start, daddy. Come
inside. You too, Liz. Come in.

01:28:20.696 --> 01:28:21.962
Thanks, Georgie.

01:28:27.303 --> 01:28:31.038
What the fuck are you doing
here? Where's Adam?

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.540
He never came back.

01:28:33.542 --> 01:28:35.008
Wha... what? What..

01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:37.344
What do you mean he never came
back? Where'd he go?

01:28:37.346 --> 01:28:40.614
- I thought you'd might know.
- Why the hell would I know?

01:28:40.616 --> 01:28:43.150
<i>I'm waiting
for that drink, John.</i>

01:28:43.152 --> 01:28:44.951
Yeah, I'm coming.

01:28:47.856 --> 01:28:49.723
No, thanks.

01:28:49.725 --> 01:28:52.526
Your name is Liz.

01:28:52.528 --> 01:28:55.829
I don't remember you. You were
in the same class as Georgina?

01:28:55.831 --> 01:28:57.798
Yes, John and Henry too.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.299
Um, we were all there
at the same time.

01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:02.536
Huh. You look younger.

01:29:02.538 --> 01:29:03.737
What do you mean
you can't find him?

01:29:03.739 --> 01:29:05.505
What are you going
on about, John?

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:07.674
No, I..

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:10.344
There's someone that, uh, Henry

01:29:10.346 --> 01:29:13.013
and I actually wanted you
to meet, but...

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:16.383
- And he's gone missing?
- Yes. Yes, he has.

01:29:16.385 --> 01:29:19.152
Shouldn't you be back at
the loft in case he shows up?

01:29:19.154 --> 01:29:21.321
- He won't.
- What are you talking about?

01:29:21.323 --> 01:29:22.622
That reminds me,
have you been able

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:25.125
to unload that Gowanus property?

01:29:25.127 --> 01:29:26.360
Where the fuck
could he have gone?

01:29:26.362 --> 01:29:29.029
Such compassion. It's touching.

01:29:29.031 --> 01:29:31.264
I don't know what's taking
so long, a loft like that.

01:29:31.266 --> 01:29:33.700
You might just have to clear out
all that junk.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.202
Anton, it's time to go.

01:29:35.204 --> 01:29:36.503
I don't want to leave
in the middle of the storm.

01:29:36.505 --> 01:29:37.871
Mother, are you sure
you won't stay?

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:41.007
No, we're leaving, I just wanted
my drink. You ready?

01:29:41.009 --> 01:29:43.677
Okay, uh, Mr. Beaufort

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:47.514
if I could maybe come
into the office on Monday

01:29:47.516 --> 01:29:50.150
I'd love to fill you in on
the work we've been doing.

01:29:50.152 --> 01:29:51.651
John, don't bother.

01:29:51.653 --> 01:29:54.588
"We," who? A... a... anyway,
we... we've got to be going.

01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:57.691
- May I use your bathroom?
- There's one in the hall.

01:29:57.693 --> 01:30:00.060
- You've been here before.
- Um, goodnight!

01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:02.796
It was nice to meet you again.

01:30:02.798 --> 01:30:05.031
<i>I'm sorry,
I don't remember you, dear.</i>

01:30:33.328 --> 01:30:34.795
<i>The roads are gonna be a fright.</i>

01:30:34.797 --> 01:30:36.096
<i>Well, talk to your father.</i>

01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:38.331
<i>He insists on waking up
in his own bed.</i>

01:30:38.333 --> 01:30:40.000
<i>Dad, you should think about
staying the night.</i>

01:30:40.002 --> 01:30:41.968
<i>We'll be fine.
We'll beat the storm.</i>

01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:44.070
<i>Georgina, can you turn
the lights on out there?</i>

01:30:44.072 --> 01:30:46.339
<i>Yes. The coast is clear.</i>

01:30:46.341 --> 01:30:48.375
<i>Goodnight. Thanks for supper.</i>

01:30:48.377 --> 01:30:51.144
- Goodnight dad.
- Goodnight, dear.

01:30:51.146 --> 01:30:54.381
Goodbye, Henry. I remember you
were very ambitious in school.

01:30:54.383 --> 01:30:56.082
You have your own practice now?

01:30:57.453 --> 01:30:59.085
<i>Henry and I have been working
on a project</i>

01:30:59.087 --> 01:31:00.620
<i>that I think might interest you.</i>

01:31:00.622 --> 01:31:02.622
<i>Just be careful who you get
mixed up with.</i>

01:31:02.624 --> 01:31:05.592
<i>I told my daughter
the same thing.</i>

01:31:05.594 --> 01:31:09.896
- Dear, let's go.
- Goodnight. Goodnight.

01:31:09.898 --> 01:31:11.865
Oh, it's already coming down
out there.

01:31:11.867 --> 01:31:12.933
<i>It's gonna take us forever
to get home.</i>

01:31:12.935 --> 01:31:14.401
<i>Calm down. We'll be fine.</i>

01:31:14.403 --> 01:31:16.369
<i>- Do you have the keys?
- Yes, I have the keys.</i>

01:31:16.371 --> 01:31:17.771
<i>Bye!</i>

01:31:17.773 --> 01:31:20.006
I'm gonna go clear the plates.

01:31:20.008 --> 01:31:21.875
<i>You two amuse yourselves.</i>

01:31:21.877 --> 01:31:25.612
I can't believe you left him
in the city.

01:31:25.614 --> 01:31:28.114
It's unbelievable.

01:31:30.886 --> 01:31:33.119
- Yes!
- <i>Find what you're looking for?</i>

01:31:33.121 --> 01:31:35.622
Oh! This is Henry's laptop.

01:31:35.624 --> 01:31:37.157
Did you know that - Know what?

01:31:37.159 --> 01:31:40.393
That John would steal something?
That he would lie about it?

01:31:40.395 --> 01:31:43.063
It takes more than that
to surprise me.

01:31:43.065 --> 01:31:45.999
Well, this is Henry's
and we came to get it back.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.335
Why are you getting yourself
mixed up in all of this?

01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:50.237
Maybe I'm tired of seeing John
take advantage of Henry.

01:31:50.239 --> 01:31:52.305
My husband has invested
I dare say everything

01:31:52.307 --> 01:31:55.408
in whatever it is that Henry
is doing and he owns it.

01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:58.011
And Henry will profit from it
in one way or another

01:31:58.013 --> 01:32:00.614
and you need to get over it
and stop interfering.

01:32:00.616 --> 01:32:02.916
Jesus, Georgie you haven't
changed one bit

01:32:02.918 --> 01:32:04.317
which is understandable
considering

01:32:04.319 --> 01:32:05.352
who your parents are.

01:32:05.354 --> 01:32:07.354
I know, you'll always be
the good girl

01:32:07.356 --> 01:32:09.489
thriving on lost causes.

01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:12.259
Shouldn't you be saving souls
in the VA right now?

01:32:12.261 --> 01:32:14.361
What's the point if SynTech
has one pill that can take care

01:32:14.363 --> 01:32:16.463
of all of them
if they can afford it?

01:32:16.465 --> 01:32:17.964
Oh, good Lord.

01:32:17.966 --> 01:32:19.933
When Henry came back
he wanted everything to be

01:32:19.935 --> 01:32:23.336
the way it was at school,
with John as his enabler.

01:32:23.338 --> 01:32:25.472
Whatever it is they're up to now

01:32:25.474 --> 01:32:27.374
maybe it will make a difference.

01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:29.976
<i>Maybe</i> being the operative word,
but there's also maybe not.

01:32:29.978 --> 01:32:31.811
And either way,
all I see is death and sadness

01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:32.913
because of what they've done.

01:32:32.915 --> 01:32:34.748
Oh, God, such melodrama.

01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:36.983
You want melodrama? How's this.

01:32:40.756 --> 01:32:43.223
What the fuck's going on?
Are you insane?

01:32:43.225 --> 01:32:45.492
What the fuck did you do..
What the.. What's she doing?

01:32:45.494 --> 01:32:47.260
- It's over, man. It's over.
- What's over?

01:32:47.262 --> 01:32:48.495
- What's over?
- He's gone.

01:32:48.497 --> 01:32:50.730
- Who's, who's gone?
- Adam is dead.

01:32:50.732 --> 01:32:52.065
We killed him.

01:32:53.268 --> 01:32:54.768
You said he left
and he didn't come back.

01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:57.938
Well, he did come back
carrying a dead girl.

01:32:59.241 --> 01:33:01.541
You were right, he's volatile.

01:33:01.543 --> 01:33:04.110
No, I... I... I just,
I only said that

01:33:04.112 --> 01:33:06.913
to turn you against him.

01:33:06.915 --> 01:33:11.017
Well, anyway, he's dead now.
Alright?

01:33:11.019 --> 01:33:13.753
He's gone and buried along
with everything else.

01:33:13.755 --> 01:33:16.990
No one will find the evidence,
this was all just a bad dream.

01:33:40.015 --> 01:33:41.881
Uh, we have to clean out
the loft.

01:33:41.883 --> 01:33:43.183
<i>It's done.</i>

01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.187
<i>Henry, take me to the station.</i>

01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:49.189
<i>I... I need to get out
of here right now.</i>

01:33:49.191 --> 01:33:50.590
<i>I need to get on a train.</i>

01:33:50.592 --> 01:33:52.359
<i>We don't do trains
this side of the river.</i>

01:33:52.361 --> 01:33:53.793
<i>Alright, a bus.</i>

01:33:53.795 --> 01:33:57.230
<i>Not at this hour.
There's a guest room upstairs.</i>

01:33:57.232 --> 01:33:59.366
<i>Well, we should go now.</i>

01:34:03.605 --> 01:34:05.171
No, fuck that.

01:34:06.642 --> 01:34:08.775
Stay one more night.

01:34:11.413 --> 01:34:13.513
For fuck's sake,
you're our oldest friends.

01:34:13.515 --> 01:34:16.916
Just, just stay and have

01:34:16.918 --> 01:34:19.319
have one drink with me.

01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:22.622
Memorialize Adam to celebrate
the work that we did.

01:34:24.626 --> 01:34:27.260
I'm going to bed.

01:34:27.262 --> 01:34:30.230
Liz, if you're sensible,
you will too.

01:34:30.232 --> 01:34:33.933
The guest room is at the top
of the stairs to the left.

01:34:33.935 --> 01:34:35.869
Henry, I can drive.

01:34:39.307 --> 01:34:41.241
We can stay the night.

01:34:41.243 --> 01:34:42.876
We'll leave first thing
in the morning.

01:34:42.878 --> 01:34:46.212
Alright, alright.
Just don't be up late.

01:34:46.214 --> 01:34:47.747
You've already drunk enough.

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:51.718
<i>It's like school all over again.</i>

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:53.720
<i>All of us together.</i>

01:34:53.722 --> 01:34:56.189
<i>Fucking Liz, man.</i>

01:34:56.191 --> 01:34:59.159
Jesus Christ, when did she
become such a champ?

01:35:01.930 --> 01:35:06.166
Ha-ha! Next time, Henry,
we'll do it legitimately.

01:35:06.168 --> 01:35:09.369
I'll give you a lab,
a nice white lab

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:12.138
and a nice white lab coat

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.641
and medical cadavers.

01:35:14.643 --> 01:35:17.210
<i>Because goddamn, man,
we need to do something about</i>

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:19.412
the emotional baggage
that we had last time

01:35:19.414 --> 01:35:21.314
because if I looked back
and I think if you looked back

01:35:21.316 --> 01:35:24.684
in hindsight that was really
where we went off

01:35:24.686 --> 01:35:27.253
the tracks, 'cause it certainly
wasn't you as a scientist.

01:35:27.255 --> 01:35:29.889
I mean, scientifically speaking

01:35:29.891 --> 01:35:32.192
as a medical doctor,
you're beyond reproach.

01:35:32.194 --> 01:35:34.894
I don't know if you're quite
the daddy that you thought

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:38.965
you were, but,
but a brilliant doctor, Henry.

01:35:38.967 --> 01:35:41.801
Nobody questions that.

01:35:41.803 --> 01:35:45.138
And I am your Igor.

01:35:46.341 --> 01:35:48.208
<i>Because what did I do?
I got you bodies.</i>

01:35:48.210 --> 01:35:50.176
<i>I even got you a fresh brain.</i>

01:35:50.178 --> 01:35:51.644
I want some kind
of credit for that

01:35:51.646 --> 01:35:54.481
but, of course, I did it.

01:35:54.483 --> 01:35:56.316
I did it for you, man.

01:35:58.086 --> 01:36:00.053
Because I love you.

01:36:00.055 --> 01:36:01.921
<i>Doctor.</i>

01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:04.457
<i>Doctor Henry Frankenstein.</i>

01:36:04.459 --> 01:36:09.129
<i>Henry, not Victor just
like in the movie.</i>

01:36:09.131 --> 01:36:10.563
I salute you.

01:36:11.767 --> 01:36:14.100
<i>Frankenstein of the Hudson.</i>

01:37:47.529 --> 01:37:50.697
No!

01:37:50.699 --> 01:37:52.298
What did you do to her?

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:55.268
Listen, listen, Adam,
Liz is your friend, alright?

01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:56.302
Just let her go.

01:37:58.673 --> 01:38:01.140
I love you, Liz. I love you.

01:38:04.779 --> 01:38:05.845
No!

01:38:37.946 --> 01:38:40.480
You're supposed to be dead.
I buried you.

01:38:45.387 --> 01:38:47.887
<i>You want revenge?
Go after Polidori.</i>

01:38:47.889 --> 01:38:50.323
He made you what you are,
he killed who you were.

01:38:50.325 --> 01:38:53.693
It was you! It was you
who made me what I am!

01:39:05.073 --> 01:39:07.407
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

01:39:07.409 --> 01:39:09.609
Look at what you've done.

01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:11.010
<i>You're despicable.</i>

01:39:11.012 --> 01:39:13.379
- Shut up.
- My father was right about you.

01:39:13.381 --> 01:39:14.714
I'm calling the police.

01:39:20.689 --> 01:39:22.255
<i>No, you're not.</i>

01:39:29.798 --> 01:39:31.597
Henry?

01:39:31.599 --> 01:39:33.299
Henry, is that you?

01:39:37.806 --> 01:39:40.306
Show yourself!

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:47.480
<i>Come on, Henry!</i>

01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:58.257
Take your time!
We can draw this out.

01:40:02.897 --> 01:40:05.765
I don't think the odds
are in your favor though.

01:40:09.971 --> 01:40:12.872
Henry, I don't think that

01:40:12.874 --> 01:40:18.444
the war prepared you
for actual combat.

01:40:20.248 --> 01:40:23.082
Not real combat between men.

01:40:24.619 --> 01:40:25.952
No.

01:40:28.356 --> 01:40:31.290
For that you need
a hunter's instinct.

01:40:34.329 --> 01:40:36.896
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

01:40:39.167 --> 01:40:41.801
Let's make this more
interesting.

01:40:44.005 --> 01:40:48.074
And where did you go?
Come out, come out.

01:40:49.944 --> 01:40:52.945
Oh, there you are.

01:40:52.947 --> 01:40:56.682
You do look perturbed, Henry.

01:40:56.684 --> 01:40:59.652
Whatever made you
kill your girl?

01:40:59.654 --> 01:41:01.954
I mean, you know, look, I'm not

01:41:01.956 --> 01:41:04.023
I'm not blaming you for it.

01:41:04.025 --> 01:41:06.292
<i>Who can take it
after a while, right?</i>

01:41:07.762 --> 01:41:09.195
<i>Stop.</i>

01:41:09.197 --> 01:41:11.330
I will shoot you,
I will kill you.

01:41:12.867 --> 01:41:15.001
I've done it before.

01:41:15.003 --> 01:41:18.004
Where the fuck do you think
those bodies came from?

01:41:20.108 --> 01:41:23.776
Adam! I thought
you were fucking dead.

01:41:23.778 --> 01:41:25.611
What are you two up to, Henry?

01:42:21.202 --> 01:42:23.870
No, no, no, Henry!

01:42:23.872 --> 01:42:25.471
Henry!

01:42:27.842 --> 01:42:31.310
Please. Please, please, please,
please, don't leave me.

01:42:31.312 --> 01:42:33.146
<i>I'm sorry, Adam.</i>

01:42:34.182 --> 01:42:36.516
I'm sorry.

01:42:36.518 --> 01:42:38.351
You can forgive me.

01:42:57.038 --> 01:42:59.038
I have no one.

01:43:00.074 --> 01:43:02.074
Yeah, well

01:43:02.076 --> 01:43:04.277
<i>companionship
is overrated anyway.</i>

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.787
Tell me somewhere
in that pea sized brain of yours

01:43:14.789 --> 01:43:16.322
you remember.

01:43:17.759 --> 01:43:20.960
<i>That night? Tell me
you remember that night, huh?</i>

01:43:21.796 --> 01:43:23.296
Alex?

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:28.768
You.. We gave you life.

01:43:30.305 --> 01:43:33.506
We gave you opportunity.

01:43:33.508 --> 01:43:37.643
And what did you do with it?
You fucking squandered it. Huh?

01:43:39.113 --> 01:43:41.113
<i>Whose fucking fault is that?</i>

01:43:42.917 --> 01:43:45.518
<i>And, now, look.</i>

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.186
<i>Everybody's dead.</i>

01:43:51.192 --> 01:43:53.326
I want you to listen to me.

01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:56.062
This is the way it's gonna go.

01:43:57.465 --> 01:44:01.467
<i>You were the crazy creation
of a mad scientist</i>

01:44:01.469 --> 01:44:04.804
<i>who went berserk
and did all of this.</i>

01:44:06.841 --> 01:44:09.475
<i>They're gonna blame you
for everything. Okay?</i>

01:44:09.477 --> 01:44:12.445
<i>And they're... they're gonna
blame you</i>

01:44:12.447 --> 01:44:13.980
<i>they're gonna blame you
for the bodies</i>

01:44:13.982 --> 01:44:15.848
<i>for the fire, for all of it.</i>

01:44:17.685 --> 01:44:20.253
You fucking understand that?

01:44:24.325 --> 01:44:25.825
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:44:27.662 --> 01:44:29.262
You're still so thick.

01:44:34.235 --> 01:44:35.434
Goodbye, Adam.

01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:51.711
<i>I came into this world filled
with wonder.</i>

01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:57.149
<i>I didn't know
how I'd come to be.</i>

01:45:57.151 --> 01:45:59.785
No! No, no, no, help.

01:45:59.787 --> 01:46:02.054
There's been
a break-in in my farm!

01:46:02.056 --> 01:46:05.024
It's uh, On the High bridge
Road. It's about two...

01:46:05.026 --> 01:46:07.526
<i>I turn to people around me</i>

01:46:07.528 --> 01:46:10.162
<i>to ask for help
in making my way.</i>

01:46:15.603 --> 01:46:17.670
<i>But now I know</i>

01:46:17.672 --> 01:46:20.339
<i>that each was only thinking
of themselves.</i>

01:46:21.743 --> 01:46:25.678
<i>They made mistakes.
I became just like them.</i>

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:28.247
Adam! Stop. Please!

01:46:28.249 --> 01:46:29.582
You... you have no one.

01:46:29.584 --> 01:46:31.817
I'll... I'll...
I'll take care of you.

01:46:31.819 --> 01:46:33.552
I'll take care of you!

01:46:38.092 --> 01:46:40.860
No! No!

01:46:40.862 --> 01:46:43.396
Gravity is your friend.

01:46:46.601 --> 01:46:49.235
<i>And now they hate me.</i>

01:46:49.237 --> 01:46:51.237
<i>And now they hunt me.</i>

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:16.362
<i>I will hide and disappear</i>

01:47:16.364 --> 01:47:18.364
<i>and learn not to care.</i>

01:47:20.067 --> 01:47:22.668
<i>This is what
they have taught me.</i>

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:35.214
Come on, we've got this
motherfucker!

01:47:36.717 --> 01:47:38.651
<i>Don't let him get away! Stop!</i>

01:47:38.653 --> 01:47:41.520
<i>Stop or we'll fire! Stop!</i>

01:48:11.152 --> 01:48:13.719
Hey, I just splurged.
Double cap.

01:48:15.156 --> 01:48:16.655
What's up?

01:48:17.458 --> 01:48:18.824
I don't know.

01:48:18.826 --> 01:48:22.161
This really creepy
looking guy left it for you.

01:48:22.163 --> 01:48:23.395
<i>He just walked out.</i>

01:48:28.536 --> 01:48:31.403
Wait, he wa... he was here?
Where'd he go?

01:48:31.405 --> 01:48:33.539
He just walked out.
