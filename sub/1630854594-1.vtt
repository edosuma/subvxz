Don't be dead, Grumio.
Don't be dead!

Why are you so slow?

01:05.960 --> 01:07.960
Told you
we shouldn't have set off now,

01:07.960 --> 01:09.960
in between brekkie
and me morning poo.

01:09.960 --> 01:10.960
I'm fully loaded over here.

Yes. Well, not everything in life

Oh, you're kidding me!
Now we'll definitely be late.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.960
Can't we just nip across this party,
or whatever?

01:39.960 --> 01:42.960
It's not a party, you idiot.
It's a victory parade.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.160
You don't just nip across.
Ooh, victory?

01:45.160 --> 01:47.960
Who'd they beat this time?
The Parthians.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.960
Looks like we kicked their arses.
Fucking losers!

01:50.960 --> 01:53.960
Ha-ha-ha! In your face, Parthians.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.960
CHANTS: Who are ya? Who are ya?

01:55.960 --> 01:57.960
Who, who, who are they, then,
these Parthians?

01:57.960 --> 02:00.320
No idea. Either way,
I'm not sure we should be cheering

02:00.320 --> 02:01.960
the annihilation of another race.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.960
It's their fault, in't it,
for messing with t'best?

Bloody hell, what were that?

02:08.960 --> 02:09.960
It sounds like we stole an elephant.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.960
They can do that with their nose,
apparently.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.960
You what? This, I've got to see.

02:13.960 --> 02:14.960
Argh!
Oh, sorry!

02:14.960 --> 02:17.960
You're treading on my foot. Sorry.
We just wanna see the elephant.

02:17.960 --> 02:18.960
Well, I wanna see soldiers.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.960
Remind myself
what real men look like.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.960
Like professional murderers,
I guess.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.960
Well, not like some whiny pussy,
whose mum still tucks him in.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.960
You have a narrow definition
of masculinity.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.960
Touch me again, I'll lamp ya.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.960
And my mum doesn't tuck me in,
thank you.

02:31.960 --> 02:32.960
Bloody Nora, it's a whopper!

02:32.960 --> 02:34.960
Argh!

02:34.960 --> 02:36.960
Argh!
I warned you, dickhead.

02:36.960 --> 02:40.960

02:49.000 --> 02:50.960
You're half an hour late.
Yeah, sorry.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.960
It was the army's fault
for blocking the road.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.960
And an old woman's fault
for punching me in the face.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.960
And my slave's for not defending me.
Defence in't my forte.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.160
This is a slave
whose licence you failed to renew.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.320
Grumio, is it?
It is, yes. Hello.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.960
Yeah, again, his fault
for not completing the paperwork.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.320
Paperwork's not my forte either.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.960
I'm not sure he has a forte,
to be honest.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.960
Well, why renew his licence, then?
Wouldn't you rather just sell him?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.960
What? Do you wanna buy him?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.000
Definitely not.
And there you go.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.960
He's a dud, and I'm stuck with him.
Pot, kettle, mate.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.640
Right. Well, fill in this form,

03:22.640 --> 03:25.000
and return to collect your licence
next week.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.320
And don't be late this time.
Yeah.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.960
Well, can I use your back
to write on? Oh!

03:31.960 --> 03:34.960
And he says I don't have a forte.

No? All right,
just follow him instead.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.960
Don't blame you,
he's a bleeding beefcake.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.960
We're busy. Why are we busy?
All right, boys?

03:56.960 --> 03:58.480
Yeah, I filled the place
with soldiers.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.960
There's someone in me seat.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.960
It's a small price to pay, Grumio.
This is amazing!

04:02.960 --> 04:03.960
I know, right?

04:03.960 --> 04:04.960
I signed us up to this thing

04:04.960 --> 04:06.960
where businesses give freebies
to soldiers.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.960
Freebies? Yeah.
And then they all just pile in.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.000
They're getting freebies?
Yes. Why would you do that?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.960
Erm, to show some appreciation
to the heroes, maybe.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.960
Yeah. And to show some appreciation
to the hotties that follow 'em in.

04:16.960 --> 04:19.960
Although, they're only really
interested in the heroes, though.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.000
Sort of backfired in that respect.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.960
It's backfired
in every bloody respect.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.960
This is a disaster!
Yeah. Where am I meant to sit?

04:25.960 --> 04:27.960
Excuse me?! Hello!

04:27.960 --> 04:29.960
Hello, heroes and friends of heroes.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.960
Just to say,
we are no longer participating

04:31.960 --> 04:33.960
in the free food and drink scheme.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.640
You're more than welcome to stay,

04:35.640 --> 04:36.960
but from now on,
you'll have to pay.

04:36.960 --> 04:37.960

04:37.960 --> 04:40.960
We've already paid, mate,
with our service.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.960
OK. Well, from now on,
you can pay with your money,

04:42.960 --> 04:44.320
for our service.

04:45.800 --> 04:46.960
Is this guy for real?
Are you for real?

04:46.960 --> 04:48.480
Yes, I am.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.960
We just conquered Parthia
for pricks like you,

04:50.960 --> 04:51.960
and this is the thanks we get?

04:51.960 --> 04:53.800
You didn't conquer it for me.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.000
I was fine without Parthia,
thank you.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.160
Some of us got killed.
Yes. Well, not you, though, clearly.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.480
I got wounded, mate.

04:59.480 --> 05:02.480
Picked up this baby
on the final assault.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.960
Did you? Really?

05:03.960 --> 05:04.960
Because I picked up a similar baby

05:04.960 --> 05:06.960
falling off a pony
when I was nine, so...

05:06.960 --> 05:08.960
Oh, I can't find it now.
It must have faded.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.960
Either way, you will have to pay,
I'm afraid.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
Well, come on, then, lads,

05:12.960 --> 05:14.960
let's go somewhere
that values our sacrifice.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.960
They're doing free chicken
at The Beak Barn.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.160
Yeah, that's more like it.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.960
Come on.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.640
You need to respect the eagle, boy.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.960
Oi, oi, oi! Stop it! Come on.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.960
A couple more whacks,
the whole thing'll come down.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.480
All right, Landlord?

05:35.480 --> 05:38.960
Salve, Grumio. Look at this.
I have a message from the Emperor.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.960
Oh, right.
Were that him there, then?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.960
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's very hands-on.
What's it say?

05:43.960 --> 05:45.960
"Following the victory in Parthia,

05:45.960 --> 05:49.960
"His Holiness Augustus Caesar
hereby calls an end to all wars

05:49.960 --> 05:51.960
"and declares an era
of lasting peace."

05:51.960 --> 05:53.960
Oh, sweet! Peace is way better.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.960
Well, it's more peaceful, in't it?
Yeah.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.960
"As a result, our brave veterans
will now need housing,

05:58.960 --> 06:01.960
"and so he commands
a series of purchase orders

06:01.960 --> 06:04.960
"on selected tenements,
including this one."

06:04.960 --> 06:07.480
What? They're buying this place?
And kicking us out, yeah.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.320
Don't kick us out. We love it here!

06:09.320 --> 06:11.960
Well, I wouldn't go that far,
but yeah, please don't kick us out.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.960
That'd be a huge faff.
Don't sweat it, boys.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.960
You know me,
I can wriggle out of it.

06:17.960 --> 06:18.960
Cheers, Landlord.
Nice.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.000
"Given the inconvenience,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.960
"we are prepared to offer
an inflated price of a h..."

06:22.960 --> 06:25.960
Bloody hell! Erm...

06:25.960 --> 06:27.320
Right. So, does that mean...?

06:27.320 --> 06:30.960
Well, maybe I can't
wriggle out of it, actually.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.960
Oh, super! Super-duper!

06:33.960 --> 06:34.960
I mean, how have they done this?

06:34.960 --> 06:36.960
In one day, these heroes
have absolutely smashed

06:36.960 --> 06:37.960
my quality of life.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.960
This must be what it's like
for the bloody Parthians.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.320
Look, I hear you, brother,
and I agree.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.960
It is jizz. It's red-hot jizz, OK?

06:44.960 --> 06:46.960
But it's how we respond
to this stuff that counts.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.960
Yes, yes. I know.
Think of the positives.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.960
Focus on what we've got.
Well, no.

06:51.960 --> 06:55.000
I was thinking more,
we join the army.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.960
I'm sorry,
what kind of response is that?

06:58.960 --> 06:59.960
Look, think about it.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.960
As soon as we put them uniforms on,

07:01.960 --> 07:03.960
we're gonna be drowning in hotties,
free chicken.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.160
And it doesn't matter
if we get turfed out of this place

07:06.160 --> 07:07.960
because they'll put us up
in barracks.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.960
You had me at free chicken,
sweetheart.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.000
And your quality of life,
double naughty.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.960
I mean, yeah, unless I get killed.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.160
Death wouldn't be ideal
for my quality of life either.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.960
Yeah, but you heard Landlord.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.000
His Holiness has declared
an era of lasting peace.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.480
We'd have all the perks
without any of the shit stuff,

07:22.480 --> 07:23.800
eg, dying.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.960
And we might get one of them
bog-brush helmets. Exactly.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.320
Come on, man, there has never been
a better time to sign up.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.960
I turn 30 in a few weeks.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.960
I'm not just starting again
as a soldier.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.160
Plus, there's the bar.
We've got to think about that.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.960
That place has got
so much untapped potential.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.960
AURELIUS: Look around you.
They've trashed the place.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.960
Me stock's gone,
the plates are in pieces,

07:46.960 --> 07:48.960
and they've shat in the wine jugs.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.800
Ugh. It's quite impressive,
actually.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.160
Oh!

07:56.160 --> 08:00.960
So, Jason, why do you want to join
the armed forces?

08:00.960 --> 08:04.960
Er, I guess, to impress girls,
you know what I mean?

08:04.960 --> 08:08.480
OK. I'm going to put "to give
something back to my country".

08:08.480 --> 08:10.320
Cool. Yeah, yeah. That, too. Yeah.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.960
Ooh!

08:13.960 --> 08:14.960
Aaahhh!

08:14.960 --> 08:17.960
Could you please tell me the motto
of the Roman Army?

08:17.960 --> 08:21.800
Uh, "kill strangers, get elephants"?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.640
Almost. It's "strength and honour".

08:24.640 --> 08:26.960
Well, they both work, don't they?

08:30.320 --> 08:31.960
WHISPERS: Yes!

08:31.960 --> 08:33.960
What would you say
is your greatest achievement?

08:33.960 --> 08:36.960
That's a tricky one.
There's so much to choose from.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.960
I once ate a wheelbarrow
full of cheese.

08:38.960 --> 08:39.960
OK. Anything else?

08:39.960 --> 08:41.960
I didn't cut my toenails for a year.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.960
I think I'll stick with the cheese.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.960
You're the boss.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.960
Congratulations!
Welcome to the army.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.160
Ha! That was easier than I thought.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.960
Well,
with so many soldiers retiring,

08:52.960 --> 08:54.960
we're taking almost anyone
at the moment.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.960
OK. That makes sense now.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.960
And we get 2,000 denarii
just for signing up.

08:58.960 --> 08:59.960
I can't believe it.
I know!

08:59.960 --> 09:02.480
I'm still waiting for the catch.
I think it's coming now.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.960
Oh, for Jove's sake,
what are you doing here?

09:05.960 --> 09:08.160
Erm, giving something back
to my country, of course.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.960
Did you follow us?

09:09.960 --> 09:11.960
Well, let's not dwell on
who followed who.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.160
So, yes, then.
Yes, I did. But who cares?

09:15.160 --> 09:16.960
We're together, is what matters.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.960
This is a whole new adventure
for us.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.160
The Barracks Boys.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.960
When do I learn
how to strangle someone?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.960
Recruits, fall in.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.960
Which one's fall in? Sorry, mate.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.320
Just stand still, golden tits.

09:29.480 --> 09:30.800
Morning!

09:31.960 --> 09:35.960
My name is Centurion Gordian,

09:35.960 --> 09:39.960
but YOU can call me sir.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.960
My job is to turn
you bunch of bed-wetters

09:43.960 --> 09:47.960
into a crack troop
of hardened killers.

09:47.960 --> 09:51.960
Which, seeing as the Emperor
has called an end to all war,

09:51.960 --> 09:54.960
is a complete fucking waste of time.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.960
We should just form a daisy chain
and fucking tug each other dry.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.000
But the big man is paying us...

10:04.480 --> 10:06.960
..so let's crack on with the oath.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.960
Repeat after me,

10:08.960 --> 10:11.960
I swear by the sacred gods
of mine own honour...

10:11.960 --> 10:14.960
ALL: I swear by the sacred gods
of mine own honour...

10:14.960 --> 10:17.960
'..that I will faithfully serve
under the standards of Rome...'

10:19.160 --> 10:22.800
ALL: '..that I will faithfully serve
under the standards of Rome...'

10:22.800 --> 10:28.960
'..that I will follow my commander,
wherever he may lead...'

10:28.960 --> 10:30.960
'..that I will obey orders
enthusiastically

10:30.960 --> 10:33.000
'and without question...'

10:33.000 --> 10:35.160
'..that I will obey orders
enthusiastically

10:35.160 --> 10:36.960
'and without question...'

10:36.960 --> 10:41.960
'..that I will support
my fellow soldiers...'

10:41.960 --> 10:47.320
'..and I will never desert
the legion.'

10:48.960 --> 10:51.960
Having made this solemn oath,
I congratulate you.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.960
Welcome to the Second Legion.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.960
You are now soldiers of Rome.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.960
Easy-peasy!

11:02.960 --> 11:05.480
I told her I was a commando.
I don't even know what that is.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.960
It's someone who don't wear undies.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.960
That was definitely true
by the end of the night.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.960
I've got to hand it to you, Jason,
I cannot believe how cushy this is.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.960
I know! And it's just marching
about, which is basically walking.

11:14.960 --> 11:15.960
And not to stroke me own goat,

11:15.960 --> 11:17.960
but I had nailed that
by the age of two.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.960
And this is great.
Uh-huh.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.000
I didn't catch much of that, Grumio,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.960
but I'm assuming it was something
about the free chicken.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.960
THEY CHUCKLE

11:33.800 --> 11:36.320
I need 400 sacks of grain,

11:36.320 --> 11:39.480
200 packhorses and 3,000 cabbages.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.960
Oh, that's a big recipe.
What are you making, a stew?

11:41.960 --> 11:43.960
CHUCKLES
No, no.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.960
We had news last night
of a barbarian invasion

11:46.960 --> 11:47.960
on our northern border.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.480
Oh, really? Where's that, then?

11:50.480 --> 11:52.960
Frisia.
About a three-week march away.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.960
Oh, that's fine.
They won't get here for ages.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.960
They won't get here at all, ideally.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.960
We're sending the Second Legion
to drive them back.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.640
Nice one! That'll learn 'em.

12:01.640 --> 12:02.960
But that's us.
We're the Second Legion.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.960
Oh, shit! That is us.
There we go. The penny's dropped.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.960
Yes, the Emperor's put us on
an immediate war footing, you see.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.960
But what about the era
of lasting peace?

12:10.960 --> 12:13.960
I suppose it didn't last very long,
did it? As per.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.960
Did you hear the news, lads?
Go pack your bollocks.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.960
We're going to war, baby. Come on!

12:18.960 --> 12:22.480
Let's kill
some filthy foreign fucks. Yes!

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Strength and honour, then.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.960
Strength and honour.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.160
War?! Fucking war?

12:41.160 --> 12:43.960
"There's never been a better time
to sign up," you said.

12:43.960 --> 12:44.960
Well, don't blame me.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.000
Blame the barbarians for invading,
or the Emperor for getting wound up.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.960
Chill out. It'll be fine.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.960
I'm sorry, what? War will be fine?

12:51.960 --> 12:53.960
Probs.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.960
Yeah. Look, it might even be good.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.960
Right, we toddle up there,
fight some foreigners,

12:57.960 --> 12:58.960
bang some birds
and then we toddle back.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.960
It'll be like a lads' holiday.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.960
Of course it won't.
It will be horrible.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.960
War is not for guys like us, OK?
Let alone Grumio.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.960
What? Why "let alone Grumio"?

13:08.960 --> 13:10.960
What part of soldiering
in't for me?

13:10.960 --> 13:11.960
Well, let's have a think, shall we?

13:11.960 --> 13:13.960
Erm, getting out of bed,
making your bed.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.640
Two things you struggle with
in the first few minutes of the day.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.960
And how will you cope
with the bloodthirsty barbarians?

13:18.960 --> 13:20.960
Well, I'll give them a wide berth,
obviously.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.960
And if shit gets nasty,
I'll play dead.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.960
I think you won't have to play dead,
Grumio, when you will just be dead.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.160
Don't worry about me, son.
I'll ace it.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.960
MARCUS SCOFFS

13:30.960 --> 13:33.960
Hey, if you're not up for it, mate,

13:33.960 --> 13:35.320
then how's about
you just don't come?

13:35.320 --> 13:37.320
Well, no, because that's desertion.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.960
And according to our oath,
that is not cool.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.960
MARCUS BREATHES HEAVILY

13:42.960 --> 13:44.160
Grumio, pass me that knife.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.960
I'm gonna chop my pinkie off.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.640
What? How's that gonna help?

13:47.640 --> 13:48.960
The army needs you to have
all ten fingers.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.960
It's a bit chicken-y.
Don't fucking judge me.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.960
I meant the knife,
it's covered in chicken juice.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.960
That's fine. Just give it here.

13:54.960 --> 13:55.960
HE EXHALES

13:57.960 --> 13:59.960
Goodbye, little finger.

13:59.960 --> 14:00.960
Never really used you,

14:00.960 --> 14:03.960
but I thank you for your sacrifice
to save the rest of me, so...

14:03.960 --> 14:05.960
MARCUS EXHALES

14:06.960 --> 14:10.160
If I can just...
bring myself to do it.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.960
MARCUS WINCES

14:15.960 --> 14:16.960
OK, I am a bit chicken-y.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.960
War it is, then. Good choice!
I'll get one more for the road.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.960
Excuse me!

14:24.960 --> 14:27.160
LIVELY MUSIC

15:09.960 --> 15:11.320
Company, fall out.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.960
Fall out, not fall down, Gallo,
you ugly turd.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.960
On your feet, man.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.960
Welcome. Welcome to the garrison.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.960
It's a bit of a sausage party,
innit?

15:22.960 --> 15:25.960
What, the army? Yeah, it is.
What were you expecting?

15:25.960 --> 15:28.960
Well, like, a girl in every port.
That's the saying, innit?

15:28.960 --> 15:31.960
Yeah, about the navy.
Is it? Shit!

15:31.960 --> 15:34.960
Saw a hot blonde standing in a field
a couple of days back.

15:34.960 --> 15:35.960
That was a scarecrow, Grumio.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.960
A hot scarecrow, then.
GORDIAN: Company, attention!

15:38.960 --> 15:39.960
ALL: Sir.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.960
Get yourselves in groups of four,
and grab a tent from the pile.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.160
Chop, chop! Get to it!

15:45.160 --> 15:47.960
And a one, two, three, four,
they call us The Canvas Crew.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.640
I don't think they do, actually.
No fucking way, mate.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.960
But why not?
We're a ready-made foursome.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.960
Er, well, because our tent's full.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.960
Yeah, we're already a foursome,
mate.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.960
What? How? Who with?

15:58.960 --> 16:00.960
Oh, God, where's he gone?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.960
It's a bit of a sausage fest, innit?

16:02.960 --> 16:05.960
There he is. Oi, mate!
Remind me your name again.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.960
Draco Fructus. Why?

16:07.960 --> 16:09.960
That's the one.
And you're in a tent with us, right?

16:09.960 --> 16:11.960
Yeah. So, whatever!

16:11.960 --> 16:13.960
Sorry, bro.
We can't let Draco Fructus down.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.960
All right, lads,
do you want to share a tent?

16:16.960 --> 16:17.960
No, OK.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.960
Greetings, Centurion.
Welcome to Frisia.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.960
Thank you, sir. Glad to be here.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.960
You shouldn't be.
This place is a total toilet.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.960
Yeah. Foreign milk tastes weird,
doesn't it, Corporal?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.960
Oh, it does, sir.
Pillows are weird as well.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.960
No fluff to them at all,
is there, Corporal?

16:30.960 --> 16:33.960
Oh, they are very flat, sir.
Disgustingly flat.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.960
Well, let's hope
these newbies are up to snuff,

16:35.960 --> 16:36.960
so we can get out of this dump,
pronto.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.960
They certainly are, sir.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.640
GRUMIO: Where's the corners?
That man's stuck in a tent.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.640
GRUMIO: Which way's the right?
Get off me!

16:43.640 --> 16:45.960
For fuck's sake!

16:45.960 --> 16:47.800
Get off me!

16:47.800 --> 16:49.320
Ridiculous!

16:49.320 --> 16:52.960
GORDIAN: Go. Move, move, move,
move, move, move, move. Move!

16:52.960 --> 16:55.960
Come on. That's it, boys.
Move on through there.

16:55.960 --> 16:59.640
And the next! Let's go.
Go on, that's it, wee man.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.960
Faster, Gallo, you boneless dick!

17:01.960 --> 17:04.960
Go, go, go! That's it, that's it!

17:04.960 --> 17:07.640
Keep moving.
Come on, Gallo. Pathetic.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.480
You're like a lifeless testicle.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.960
Concentrate, Gallo,

17:13.960 --> 17:16.800
that wrist's had enough practice,
hasn't it?

17:16.800 --> 17:18.960
Well done, Grumio.
That's nice and shiny.

17:21.960 --> 17:25.320
Don't just hang there, Gallo,
you miserable streak of spunk.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.960
Pull up!

17:29.160 --> 17:33.960
OK, shit birds, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.960
Combat training.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.480
I need a volunteer.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.960
Go on, then, sir, I'll have a bash.
Good man.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.960
Grab a sword.
All right. Oh!

17:44.960 --> 17:46.960
Now, I want you to edge forward,

17:46.960 --> 17:48.960
side on and stab it.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.960
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.160
Good. Good stance.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.960
Low centre of gravity.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.960
Did you spar back in Rome?

17:58.960 --> 18:00.960
Well, the bath house
did have a steam room, yeah.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.960
Did you fight at home?

18:02.960 --> 18:04.960
No, sir. I mostly ate and slept.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.960
Ah, then, you must be a natural.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.960
MARCUS SCOFFS
AND CHUCKLES

18:09.960 --> 18:11.960
You disagree, do you, legionary?

18:12.960 --> 18:15.800
Well, perhaps you would like to
show us how it's done.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.960
Oh, yes, please do, legionary.

18:19.960 --> 18:20.960
OK.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.960
So, something like...
Side on.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.160
I ordered you to stab, not swipe!

18:30.160 --> 18:31.800
Got it.
"Got it, sir."

18:31.800 --> 18:33.960
Got it, sir. All right.
It's quite heavy, innit?

18:33.960 --> 18:34.960
Side on!

18:34.960 --> 18:36.960
I ordered you to stab, not swipe!

18:36.960 --> 18:39.960
Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab!

18:39.960 --> 18:41.960
Oh, oh!
Did I say you could stop?!

18:41.960 --> 18:45.960
Sorry, sir, I just got a splinter.
A splinter? Oh, shit!

18:45.960 --> 18:48.960
Oh, is that why you're wailing
like a baby being buggered, is it?

18:48.960 --> 18:49.960
SOLDIERS LAUGH

18:49.960 --> 18:54.160
How in Jove's name are you
gonna cope with actual barbarians?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.960
Will they be made of wood, sir?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.160
No, legionary,
they will not be made of wood!

18:58.160 --> 19:01.160
They will be made
of pure savagery and hatred!

19:01.160 --> 19:02.960
Something you'd better be ready for

19:02.960 --> 19:05.960
if you're gonna be in the front line
of the Roman fucking Army.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.640
Sorry, in the front line?

19:08.640 --> 19:10.960
Stand down, Gallo,
you quivering anus.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.960
And shut up.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.960
Pathetic!

19:20.000 --> 19:21.160
The front line?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.160
I thought we'd be hidden
in the middle somewhere.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.960
The front line's closest to
the action. That's what you want.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.960
If you're at a gig, yes.
Not at a war.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.960
Hey, we'll be first
into enemy territory,

19:29.960 --> 19:32.960
so dibs on the spoils,
if you know what I'm saying?

19:32.960 --> 19:35.800
Oh-ho, yeah.
I'm gonna spoils myself rotten.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.960
Oh, yeah, man, we'll scoop up
some of that sweet barbarian booty.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.960
The booty!
The fruity booty!

19:40.960 --> 19:41.960
Sorry, just to be clear,

19:41.960 --> 19:43.800
are you talking about
sexual assault?

19:43.800 --> 19:45.960
No! I don't think so. What? Are we?

19:45.960 --> 19:47.320
No. No, not exactly.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.640
Pillaging booty is a well-known part
of the war experience.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.960
Consensual pillaging, yeah?
Well, they're foreign,

19:52.960 --> 19:54.960
so it's hard to know
what they're saying.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.800
Don't worry about it.
It's a grey area.

19:57.800 --> 19:58.960
It's quite dark grey, though, innit?

19:58.960 --> 20:00.960
Booty!
Uh-huh.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.960
Little tip from the top, I apply oil
to my lips to keep them lubed.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.000
Aurelius, where've you been?
Why weren't you at training?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.960
And what's with the curly sword?
It's my big bugle, if you must know.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.960
Top brass saw I had music skills
on my forms

20:11.960 --> 20:12.960
and transferred me
to the Empire Band.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.960
The band? What, do you still have to
do soldiering, or what?

20:15.960 --> 20:17.960
No. We just play tunes at the back.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.960
Which is a shame
cos I'm also an excellent archer.

20:20.960 --> 20:21.960
But hey-ho.

20:21.960 --> 20:23.960
Can we get transferred to
the Empire Band?

20:23.960 --> 20:24.960
I doubt it.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.960
You need at least grade five
in a wind instrument.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.800
And, no, your bottom doesn't count.

20:28.800 --> 20:29.960
THEY LAUGH

20:29.960 --> 20:32.640
Come on, band of brothers,
let's leave these losers behind.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.960
I'll catch you guys in a bit.
Hey, where you going?

20:36.960 --> 20:38.960
We're trying out
defensive manoeuvres.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.640
Yeah. Yeah, so am I.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.960
Hello there. I'm here to see
the senior officer.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.960
I've just arrived from Rome.
Oh, yes, of course.

20:53.960 --> 20:57.000
The General's just through there.
Through here? Uh-huh.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.960
In you go, then.
He's here, sir!

21:03.960 --> 21:06.480
General Diomedes, sir.
Ah-ha, and about time too.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.960
Where do you want me,
on the couch, the desk?

21:08.960 --> 21:09.960
Er, wherever you like.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.960
It was just to ask about
the possibility of, er...

21:11.960 --> 21:14.960
I can't tell you how desperately
I've needed someone with expertise.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.960
Come on, then, hop to it.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.960
My neck and shoulders
are in absolute knots.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.960
Chop, chop!
Right. Yes. Yeah.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.960
Ah.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.960
Senator Macrobius
was singing your praises.

21:38.960 --> 21:42.320
Said you had the magic touch.
That's... kind of him?

21:42.320 --> 21:44.640
Hence why I had you sent from Rome.

21:44.640 --> 21:48.640
The doctors they have here are weird
with weird smelly hands.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.960
Don't hold back.
Really get in there, nice and deep.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.960
Ah, yes, that's it.
Is it?

21:55.960 --> 21:58.960
I mean... yes, I know it is.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.320
Am I knotty? I imagine I'm knotty.
Extremely knotty.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.000
Have you been doing
anything stressful recently?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.960
Yes, I'm the General of the Roman
Army during a military campaign.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.960
And that explains it.
Ah.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.160
You know what? I think you need me
in here with you full time.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.960
CLICK
What was that? Was that a click?

22:16.960 --> 22:19.960
Yes, it was.
But it was a good click.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.960
I clicked it on purpose. Well,
it didn't feel like a good click.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.960
Well, which one of us is the expert?
Excuse me, sir.

22:25.960 --> 22:29.800
Sorry to interrupt.
What is it, Corporal? I'm busy.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.960
The masseur has just arrived
from Rome. Yes, I know, evidently.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.320
Ah, no.

22:38.160 --> 22:41.960
This is my masseur?
Ergo, this is not my masseur?

22:41.960 --> 22:44.960
Who the fuck are you, please?
Marcus Gallo. Hi.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.960
I'm a legionary in the Second.
I came to request a transfer, but...

22:47.960 --> 22:49.960
You started massaging me?
I did, yes.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.960
It just felt like
the right thing to do.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.960
You clicked my neck, you fool.
Sorry about that.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.640
Even so, I do think I'd be better
in a non-combat role, all the same.

22:57.640 --> 22:58.960
Why did you let him in here,
Thaddeus?

22:58.960 --> 23:01.960
I thought... Well, exactly.
You should give me HIS job.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.960
I would never have let me in here.
No way. Get out!

23:03.960 --> 23:04.960
Yes, sir.
Now!

23:15.160 --> 23:17.960
Oh, you missed a good one today,
Marcus.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.960
Yeah. Gordian taught us
this formation called the tortoise.

23:19.960 --> 23:23.000
Does it involve moving very slowly
and living to a ripe old age?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.960
Cos that sounds ideal.

23:26.960 --> 23:30.960
Hey, I know you from somewhere.
Where do I know you from?

23:30.960 --> 23:33.960
No. No, I'm a stranger.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.960
Hey, Virgil, how do I know this guy?

23:35.960 --> 23:38.960
The Crown And Toga, in Rome.
Wouldn't serve you free drinks.

23:38.960 --> 23:39.960
Thank you, Grumio (!)

23:39.960 --> 23:41.960
LAUGHS
Yes, that's how I know him.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.960
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The shirty barman.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.960
What are you doing here? You weren't
a huge fan of the army, as I recall.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.960
Yes. Well, I needed a new vocation
after my workplace

23:50.960 --> 23:53.800
was mysteriously trashed.
Oh, was it really?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.960
That's a shame. Shame.
THEY LAUGH

23:55.960 --> 23:58.960
Well, the military is no place
for a little puss boy like you.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.640
You'll be cacking your panties
when those barbarians show up.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.960
No, I won't, won't be doing that.
BLOWS RASPBERRY

24:04.960 --> 24:07.960
I'll be repelling them, if anything.
Yeah, with the smell of your pants.

24:07.960 --> 24:12.480
MIMICS THEIR LAUGH
No. With my acts of valour.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.960
Because, for your information,
I'm thriving here.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.160
I'm really impressing
and wowing people, actually.

24:18.160 --> 24:21.960
Legionary Gallo, I know you missed
training today and I know why,

24:21.960 --> 24:23.960
you filthy little bitch.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.960
Muster up the unit by the tents
in one hour.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.960
Yes, sir.
One hour, fuck knuckle.

24:30.960 --> 24:34.960
He seemed impressed, didn't he?
Oh, yeah. He was well impressed.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.320
SHRIEKING LAUGHTER

24:41.480 --> 24:43.960
This afternoon,
it was brought to my attention

24:43.960 --> 24:47.960
that a member of our unit
stole into the General's quarters

24:47.960 --> 24:51.960
and assaulted his naked body.
Assaulted's a bit strong.

24:51.960 --> 24:56.960
Accordingly, there will be
a punishment for the entire unit.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.960
ALL GROAN
So, we shall be doing a dawn patrol.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.960
Paying a friendly visit to some
local villages,

25:02.960 --> 25:04.320
making our presence felt.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.960
I'll make them feel MY presence,
all right.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.320
Well, yeah, ask them to.
Not make 'em.

25:09.320 --> 25:12.960
Grumio, I am promoting you
to Legionary First Class

25:12.960 --> 25:14.160
in recognition of your progress.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.960
You will carry the eagle on patrol.
Can you handle that?

25:17.960 --> 25:20.960
Will it peck me, sir?
It's made of solid gold.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.960
Then I can handle it, sir.
Good.

25:22.960 --> 25:25.960
I suggest we all get some sleep.
We're up at first light.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.960
OK. What are you doing?
What are you on about?

25:29.960 --> 25:34.960
What? Obeying orders? Being... good?
What are you up to?

25:34.960 --> 25:36.960
Nothing. He's my commanding officer.
He outranks me.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.960
So do I. I'm literally your master
and you have never done a thing

25:39.960 --> 25:42.960
I've asked you to,
let alone call me "sir".

25:42.960 --> 25:45.960
Odd that, in't it? Maybe
it's just a question of respect.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.480
If anything,
you should be calling me sir now.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.960
OK. Just remember
who the boss is here.

25:49.960 --> 25:52.960
Probably the lad
with the solid gold eagle.

26:33.960 --> 26:34.960
Hey.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.960
# We're going to a village
We'll have a little pillage

26:38.960 --> 26:41.960
# I need to do my duty
Let's go and grab some booty

26:41.960 --> 26:46.960
# Before we stick it in
Let's get their permission. #

26:47.960 --> 26:50.960
Well, no booty for me, thanks, guys.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.960
I've-I've got a sweetheart
waiting for me back home.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.960
Ah, that's nice.
Yep. I keep a picture in my pocket

26:55.960 --> 26:57.960
so I can see her every day
until we're reunited.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.960
Can you not do that, please?
Marcus is a bit unlucky in love.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.960
It's just, it's making me
a bit uncomfortable.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.960
We're getting married when I'm back.
It just feels like tempting fate.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.960
There will be a big party
and you'll all be invited.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.960
Oh, wicked, cheers! It'll be
the happiest day of my life.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.960
Shut up, please!
Sorry, dude. No offence!

27:12.960 --> 27:15.960
Chill out, dude! He's just
wanging on about his sweetheart.

27:17.640 --> 27:18.960
RUSTLING

27:20.960 --> 27:22.960
Sir, there's something in t'trees.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.960
Oh, and by the way, sir,
I absolutely love my new hat. Shh!

27:30.960 --> 27:33.960
MEN SHOUTING

27:36.960 --> 27:38.960
SHOUTING GETTING LOUDER

27:42.160 --> 27:44.960
AXE WHOOSHES

27:47.000 --> 27:50.800
It's an ambush!

27:50.800 --> 27:55.000
Testudo, move up! Testudo!
Testudo!

27:55.000 --> 27:58.640
What? What does that mean?
Tortoise formation!

27:58.640 --> 28:01.960
That was the one I missed!
Just get under your shield!

28:02.960 --> 28:04.960
Fuck, I don't like it.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.640
I don't like it!

28:23.000 --> 28:24.960
Oh, my fucking God!

28:29.960 --> 28:31.960
Fuck me!

28:33.960 --> 28:35.960
Get off me!

28:42.960 --> 28:43.960
Let's get out of here!

28:43.960 --> 28:46.640
I don't think that's really allowed,
is it? Who cares?!

28:48.320 --> 28:50.800
OK. Fair enough. Let's go.

29:09.960 --> 29:10.960
Grumio?

29:11.960 --> 29:14.960
The barbarians have definitely
gone home.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.640
Yeah, for now. Go on, then.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.960
Grumio. Grumio, mate.

29:27.960 --> 29:33.640
Oh, sorry! Sorry, mate.
Who are you saying sorry to?

29:33.640 --> 29:35.960
The dead guys.
I keep stepping on them.

29:35.960 --> 29:36.960
Sorry, sir.

29:39.800 --> 29:40.960
Grumio.

29:42.960 --> 29:45.960
Have you found him? No, it's just
someone else with a shit haircut.

29:46.960 --> 29:50.960
Grumio? Grumio, mate.
Grumio.

29:55.960 --> 29:56.960
Marcus!

29:58.960 --> 30:04.640
Oh, Grumio. No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Grumio.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.960
Grumio. No.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.640
Grumio, please don't be dead.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.960
Don't be dead, Grumio,
don't be dead!

30:12.960 --> 30:15.160
SOBBING: I'm sorry.

30:15.160 --> 30:17.960
Poor, sweet Grumio.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.960
All right, chill out.
You're not dead?!

30:24.960 --> 30:26.960
No, I'm playing dead,
like I said I would.

30:26.960 --> 30:29.640
Bloody hell, G-man.
Thank fuck for that!

30:29.640 --> 30:32.640
Come on, then.
Get this big bastard off me.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.160
OK. Let's get out of here.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.960
I'm not loving the vibe.

30:41.960 --> 30:42.960
Sorry.

30:47.960 --> 30:49.960
You were so still.
I totally thought you was a goner.

30:49.960 --> 30:53.960
I actually fell asleep for a bit.
That barbarian was so cosy.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.960
Yeah, I think Rome's due south,
whichever way that is.

30:56.960 --> 30:59.000
OK, cool. I'm on it.
Rome?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.960
Who cares about Rome?
We're going back to camp.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.960
Are you kidding me? We're not
going back to the army ever again.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.480
We swore an oath.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.960
If we don't go back now,
we're a bunch of shitty deserters.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.960
Yeah. Well, I think I finally found
my ideal role in the army.

31:11.960 --> 31:13.960
You lily-livered bastard.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.960
I'm sorry.
Which one of us played dead?

31:15.960 --> 31:19.960
As Legionary First Class, I order
you to take me back to camp.

31:19.960 --> 31:23.480
And as your master, I laugh
in the face of your orders. Ha!

31:24.960 --> 31:27.960
But it's up to you, Grumio.
You can toddle off back to camp

31:27.960 --> 31:29.160
and die in a horrid battle,

31:29.160 --> 31:31.000
or you can head south
with me and Jason.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.960
Which is this way, by the way.
Is it? Yeah.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.320
How do you know that? Oh, me and
my dad used to go camping, right?

31:36.320 --> 31:38.960
We'd always work out the route
by the sploshing of the rivers,

31:38.960 --> 31:40.960
the squawking of the geese, like...
Oh, yeah.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.960
Over to you, then.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.960
We should get rid of
these uniforms, though,

31:44.960 --> 31:46.960
with all these barbarians
knocking about.

31:46.960 --> 31:47.960
I prefer not to look
like a Roman soldier.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.960
Yeah, good shout. No, me neither.

31:51.960 --> 31:54.960
And nor would General Grumio,
it seems.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.960

32:50.960 --> 32:53.960
They slaughtered every last man in
the unit, sir, and took the eagle.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.480
What? They took the eagle?
That's outrageous.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.640
And slaughtered every last man
in the unit.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.960
Yes, of course, and it's sad.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.960
Excuse me, sir. Sorry to interrupt.
Aurelius Leifer, bugle man.

33:03.960 --> 33:06.960
Just to say, there are three men
I can't find among the dead, sir.

33:06.960 --> 33:10.960
Names? Marcus Gallo, Jason Brindisi
and Grumio Grumio.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.960
You said Gallo? Well, he's
the arsehole that buggered my neck.

33:13.960 --> 33:16.960
It's because of that charlatan
I can no longer turn my head.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.960
Look at this. I have to wheel around
like a bloody weather vane.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.960
He's not in my list of the dead,
sir. Nor are the other two.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.960
And yet they've not reported back.
Ergo, they must be deserters.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.960
Well, that makes total sense, sir.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.960
They already deserted me
as a friend.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.320
Optio? Sir?
Alert the tracker.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.960
If anyone can hunt down
these deserters,

33:32.960 --> 33:35.960
it's that brooding bastard.
Oh, the tracker sounds cool.

33:35.960 --> 33:37.960
Oh, he is... very cool.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.960
Then if I may, sir,
I'd like to go too.

33:39.960 --> 33:42.800
You see, I know these guys
like my own shadow.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.960
I've worked with them,
eaten with them, slept with them.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.320
I've slept NEAR them.
I haven't had sex with any of them.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.960
Yes, yes. Very well.
You may accompany him.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.960
Help bring these treacherous shits
to justice.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.480
You can count on me, sir.

33:53.480 --> 33:55.960
They'll get their just deserts
as deserters.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.960
The deserters
will get their deserts, sir.

34:01.960 --> 34:04.960
And let's find whichever barbarian
pig fucker stole the eagle

34:04.960 --> 34:06.960
and raze their village
to the ground.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.960
And our dead soldiers, sir?
Yes, of course.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.960
Give them a dignified funeral.
But do start with the eagle.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.000
Oh, it's chuffing chilly up north,
in't it?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.960
Yeah, on reflection, dumping
our uniform wasn't the best idea.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.960
Hold tight, boys. We'll soon feel
the Roman sun on our backs.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.960
In the meantime, we could put on
these uniforms down by this tree.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.960
Those are our uniforms.
Even better, then.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.160
No. Much worse!

34:36.160 --> 34:38.960
It means we've been walking
in a massive circle all day.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.960
But I was following the river
and water always goes south.

34:40.960 --> 34:44.160
Well, it goes down, yeah.
Yeah, exactly. The same thing.

34:44.160 --> 34:47.960
Is down the same as south?
No, it isn't.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.960
Yes. What? Is it? Huh?

34:49.960 --> 34:53.480
Sorry, Jason.
What exactly did your dad teach you

34:53.480 --> 34:54.640
on these camping trips?

34:54.640 --> 34:55.960
Well, I was on his shoulders
most of the time,

34:55.960 --> 34:57.960
so I couldn't always hear
what he was saying

34:57.960 --> 35:00.960
and, to be fair, we mainly camped
in the garden, so...

35:00.960 --> 35:03.800
OK. So, you never got lost
in the garden?

35:03.800 --> 35:04.960
Well, no. That's it. Never.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.960
Right. It feels like it's time
for a lunch break.

35:07.960 --> 35:08.960
Let's go and hunt down some scran.

35:08.960 --> 35:12.320
See, my dad would know
all about that.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.960
Well, I wish we'd brought him
instead. Yeah, big time.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.960
So tell me, what are they like,
these deserters?

35:23.960 --> 35:25.960
It's good to know
what I'm dealing with.

35:25.960 --> 35:27.960
Oh, they're... they're mean.

35:27.960 --> 35:31.480
Mean? As in tough?

35:31.480 --> 35:33.960
No. Sorry. Mean as in not very nice.

35:33.960 --> 35:37.960
They're rude, basically.
Rude? Huh, now I am scared.

35:37.960 --> 35:41.960
Rude how?
Oh, I mean, where do I start?

35:41.960 --> 35:44.960
So, one of them, Marcus,
I met while working as a waterman

35:44.960 --> 35:47.960
at Rome's third largest
grain supply company.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.960
He and his buddy, Stylax,
were constantly calling me names,

35:50.960 --> 35:53.960
sneaking stuff into my jug.
Undermining me, basically.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.960
Probably payback because
I'd smooched this Breton he fancied.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.640
Not my fault. She couldn't keep
her hands off me. She's only human.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.960
Then, when Stylax got squashed
by a slab of marble,

36:01.960 --> 36:04.320
I thought Marcus would go easy.
But then Jason comes in

36:04.320 --> 36:06.960
and, actually, if anything,
things got even worse.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.960
And Jason is...?
Another deserter. And total scumbag.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.960
No sooner had I met him,
than he's making me hide the corpse

36:12.960 --> 36:14.480
of a well-known restaurant critic.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.960
Then he sabotaged me
in the Rome marathon.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.960
Made me eat my own poo.
Ruined my career as an escort...

36:18.960 --> 36:21.960
Hold on! You ate your own shit?

36:21.960 --> 36:22.960
Yes, because I'd lost a bet,
you see.

36:22.960 --> 36:25.000
But he didn't need to make me
go through with it.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.960
This is what I'm talking about.
They're mean guys.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.960
And don't even get me started
on the little one.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.960
He looks exactly like a mushroom.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.960
He once ate a crab
as though it was a pie.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.960
Just picked it up,
like it was a pie.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.960
Bit it, hurt his tooth.
Of course he did, it's a crab.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.960
Hey, I've found an apple.
Sweet. Give it here, then.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.960
No, no, stop!
We've got to share it, obviously.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.960
Fine. We'll take bites in turns.
No. No, no, Grumio.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.800
You'll eat it all in one.
Yeah, we should slice it up evenly.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.960
How? We haven't got a knife?
We've got swords.

37:01.960 --> 37:04.960
Oh, yeah, I forgot about these.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.960
Probably should have used it
in the ambush.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.960
Oh, well, too late now.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.960
Stab, don't swipe.
Don't you start with that.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.960
HORSE WHINNIES
WHISPERS: Barbarians, get down.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.960
OK, everyone quiet and still.

37:23.960 --> 37:24.960
APPLE CRUNCHES

37:27.960 --> 37:28.960
What the fuck, Grumio?

37:28.960 --> 37:33.960
I'm starving. I'll take my chances.
Stop it! It's too crunchy.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.960
Fine. I'll lick it like a lolly.

37:37.960 --> 37:38.960
Don't do that, it's gross.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.800
OK. All right,
I think they're going.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.480
No thanks to this greedy goon.

37:50.480 --> 37:53.640
Oi, look at the size of that bite.
That's well out of order.

37:53.640 --> 37:56.800
Oh, good!
So it's anarchy now, is it?

37:56.800 --> 37:57.960
I wondered how long it would take.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.960
He posed as a child
to win a school boxing competition.

38:02.960 --> 38:03.960
He fingered a lion.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.960
He killed, genuinely killed,
a renowned theatre director.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.000
He took a baby from the bins.
Shut the fuck up a second. Whoa.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.960
What, what, what is it?

38:18.960 --> 38:20.960
Apple core.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.960
Only just starting to brown.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.960
They were here not long ago.
What? How do you know it was them?

38:25.960 --> 38:28.000
These are strong Roman tooth marks.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.960
Dentistry's not so good around here.
Wow!

38:31.960 --> 38:34.960
This is cool.
You, sir, are very cool.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.960
And, you know, it is so nice
to hang out with someone

38:37.960 --> 38:38.960
as intelligent as I am.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.960
Honestly, those thicko losers
could be so annoying.

38:40.960 --> 38:44.960
We're not hanging out.
You're just tagging along.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.960
In silence from now on.

38:46.960 --> 38:50.960
If it was up to me,
I'd be working alone, OK?

38:50.960 --> 38:53.000
But I haven't even told you
about the time Marcus's dad

38:53.000 --> 38:56.320
stabbed me in the shoulder. And I'll
stab you in the fucking neck

38:56.320 --> 38:58.960
if I have to hear another
one of your idiotic stories.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.960
Understand me, beardy boy?

39:02.960 --> 39:04.960
Beardy MAN.

39:17.960 --> 39:21.960
Stupid midges. They don't know
who they're up against.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.960
I've actually decided
not to light a fire,

39:23.960 --> 39:26.480
cos it might alert the enemy
to our location.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.480
And also cos you can't?
And that, yeah.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.800
Oh, God, this is a new low.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.960
This is really not where I thought
I'd be on the brink of turning 30.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.960
Oh, come on, it's not so bad.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.960
If you forget about
the whole war thing

39:37.960 --> 39:39.960
and the fact that
we're totally lost, it's great.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.800
The three of us, bro-ing down,
having a giggle,

39:42.800 --> 39:46.960
surrounded by nature.
I guess it is pretty peaceful here.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.960
Oh! For fuck's sake, Grumio.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.960
You were surrounded by nature.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.960
Well, I'm knackered.
I'm gonna crash.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.960
OK. But we need someone
on guard duty at all times.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.960
We sleep in shifts, OK?

39:57.960 --> 39:59.960
Whatever happens,
one of us has to be awake.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.160
Right you are.
No probs.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.640
BUGLE PLAYS

40:18.960 --> 40:22.640
Wakey-wakey, dirt bags.
That was your morning bugle.

40:22.640 --> 40:25.960
Look at you three, spooning away.
It's quite sweet, actually.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.960
Aurelius, what are you doing here?

40:27.960 --> 40:29.960
Please say you're not still
following us.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.960
Well, I am, yes.
But officially this time.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.320
I'm a tracker,
and we're the tracking team.

40:34.320 --> 40:38.480
No, we're not. We're not a team,
and he's not a tracker in any way.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.960
But I am. And I'm here
to arrest you for desertion.

40:41.960 --> 40:44.960
You're to be taken back to camp
where you'll be crucified.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.480
Best go quietly now.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.960
Morning. Oh, what have I missed?

41:02.480 --> 41:06.960
I can't believe you're
getting us executed, you knob.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.000
I'm not a knob, actually,

41:08.000 --> 41:10.800
because I didn't know
that was the punishment.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.000
I thought it would just be
a ticking off or a light flogging.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.960
It still makes you a knob.
Yeah, a complete knob.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.160
Stop whining!

41:16.160 --> 41:17.960
If you don't want to die,
don't desert.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.960
It's as simple as that.
Great advice (!)

41:19.960 --> 41:21.960
We'll bear that in mind
for next time, shall we?

41:21.960 --> 41:22.960
I didn't desert, by the way.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.960
I were forced into it
by my master here.

41:24.960 --> 41:28.960
Ha! OK, so as soon as there's
a price to pay, I'm in charge, am I?

41:28.960 --> 41:29.960
I were basically kidnapped.
Of course.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.960
And are you gonna
mention playing dead?

41:31.960 --> 41:34.800
Didn't force you into that, did I?
I fell asleep.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.960
It's not my fault them
barbarians wear such cosy clobber.

41:36.960 --> 41:42.960
Shut up, or I'm very happy to bring
the execution forward a few hours.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.000
MUSIC: 'You Don't Love Me'
by Dawn Penn

41:45.000 --> 41:47.960
# No, no, no

41:49.960 --> 41:55.800
# You don't love me
And I know now

42:00.960 --> 42:04.960
# No, no, no

42:06.960 --> 42:13.800
# You don't love me
Yes, I know now. #

42:18.960 --> 42:20.960
So, it's grilled badger for lunch.

42:20.960 --> 42:23.640
What? Badger? I'm not eating that.
I'll have his, then.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.960
I'd eat a badger's tadger right now,
I'm so hungry.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.960
You're so weird.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.960
Wait, Aurelius!

42:29.960 --> 42:33.480
Relio. Relio Delio.
I'm not gonna help you escape.

42:33.480 --> 42:37.000
Please. We're gonna die.
We're all gonna die eventually.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.960
Don't be a dick. Just set us free.

42:38.960 --> 42:41.320
No way! I'll get in big troubs.

42:41.320 --> 42:43.960
Not if you come with us.
It'll be an adventure.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.960
The deserter dudes.
Best bros forever!

42:45.960 --> 42:49.480
Hm! We weren't exactly best bros
when I wanted to share your tent,

42:49.480 --> 42:50.960
as I recall.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.480
Well, yeah, but we couldn't
share with you

42:53.480 --> 42:55.000
cos what if we wanted
to bring girls back?

42:55.000 --> 42:56.960
I could have scooched over.
No!

42:56.960 --> 43:00.960
They wouldn't be interested in us
if you were there. Think about it.

43:00.960 --> 43:04.480
But the truth is, it's not easy
being mates with you, dude.

43:04.480 --> 43:07.960
Like, having this buff, brainy
legend around all the time,

43:07.960 --> 43:09.960
making us feel like losers.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.960
You can't blame us for wanting to
step out of your shadow sometimes.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.960
It's cold in there, right, guys?

43:14.960 --> 43:17.960
I mean... Completely.
..sure, whatever.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.960
God, you must think I'm such a fool,

43:20.960 --> 43:23.960
not seeing how insecure
I was making you feel.

43:23.960 --> 43:29.960
Maybe I am buff and brainy, sure,
but I'm also blind and a bad friend.

43:30.960 --> 43:34.960
Well, never again, guys.
You have my word. Best bros forever.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.800
Fuck me, what a bellend.

43:37.800 --> 43:40.160
Oh, can we do this after
we've had the badger?

43:40.160 --> 43:43.640
OK, shit! I think he's on to us.
What's going on over there?

43:43.640 --> 43:45.960
No, no, nothing. All good.

43:45.960 --> 43:46.960
Run!

43:48.960 --> 43:50.640
Shit!

44:17.960 --> 44:19.960
CLICKS TONGUE
This way.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.640
Argh!

44:29.960 --> 44:31.960
HORSE WHINNIES

44:41.960 --> 44:43.960
HORSE WHINNIES

44:45.320 --> 44:46.960
Come on!

45:03.480 --> 45:04.960
Argh!

45:08.960 --> 45:10.160
Hey, hey!

45:20.320 --> 45:22.320
Argh! Fucking nettles!

45:22.320 --> 45:23.960
Argh!

45:34.800 --> 45:35.960
Argh! Oh!

45:39.960 --> 45:41.800
Shit!

45:42.960 --> 45:45.960
Come on, boys, don't be stupid now.

45:46.960 --> 45:48.960
Let's be stupid.

45:48.960 --> 45:51.960
No! Aaaargh!

45:54.960 --> 45:56.320
No!

45:56.320 --> 45:57.960
Stop!

45:57.960 --> 46:00.960
Aaaaargh!

46:06.960 --> 46:08.640
You won't get away!

46:08.640 --> 46:12.640
Wherever you run, wherever you hide,
no matter how long it takes,

46:12.640 --> 46:14.960
the shadow of justice
will haunt you until...

46:14.960 --> 46:16.960
Oh, fuck it, they've gone.

46:21.960 --> 46:24.000
PANTING AND GASPING

46:30.960 --> 46:32.960
We lost him!

46:32.960 --> 46:35.960
Ha! We bloody lost him,
the dickhead!

46:35.960 --> 46:37.960
And, weirdly,
I don't appear to be dead.

46:37.960 --> 46:41.160
Bonus!
Ha!

46:41.160 --> 46:45.000
Guys, I actually got hit.
Did you? Where?

46:46.640 --> 46:48.160
Whoa!

46:48.160 --> 46:50.960
What is it? Is it bad?
Not ideal!

46:50.960 --> 46:53.480
You've got an arrow in your arse!
Argh, argh, argh!

46:53.480 --> 46:55.960
Well, pull it out, then!
Oh, God, really?

46:55.960 --> 46:56.960
I mean, OK.

46:58.960 --> 47:01.960
Don't pick your nose, Grumio.
I'm hungry.

47:01.960 --> 47:02.960
Well, that's even worse.

47:02.960 --> 47:04.960
Aurelius,
where's the key to these chains?

47:04.960 --> 47:05.960
Maybe in my man bag,

47:05.960 --> 47:07.960
if it didn't fall out
in the kerfuffle.

47:09.960 --> 47:12.320
All right, here we go.
Brace yourself, yeah?

47:12.320 --> 47:15.000
OK, great. No keys.
But there is a soggy map.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.800
Is there?
OK, it's coming!

47:17.800 --> 47:18.960
It's coming!

47:18.960 --> 47:20.800
SNAP
Ooh!

47:20.800 --> 47:22.960
Is it out, then?
Er...

47:22.960 --> 47:25.960
Yeah. Like, most of it.
Most of it? What do you mean?

47:25.960 --> 47:27.960
Argh! Argh!

47:27.960 --> 47:31.160
You just pulled out the shaft
and left the head inside my arse!

47:31.160 --> 47:33.960
Ooh-er. Ha!
It's not funny, actually!

47:33.960 --> 47:35.960
I won't get very far
with a skewered buttock.

47:35.960 --> 47:38.960
Luckily, you might not have to,
cos if this is that river,

47:38.960 --> 47:42.960
then we're only, like,
a day's walk from the Roman border.

47:42.960 --> 47:44.960
Ah, nice!
See, all rivers do lead south.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.960
On this occasion, yes, they do.
Right. Let's crack on.

47:47.960 --> 47:49.960
Ow, ow!
Rome, here we come.

47:49.960 --> 47:54.960
Oh, God! Erm, can we crack on
quite slowly, please?

47:54.960 --> 47:57.480
MUSIC: 'Sun Is Shining
(Dub Version)' by Bob Marley

47:57.480 --> 48:00.960
# The weather is sweet, yeah... #

48:02.960 --> 48:04.960
Ah! Ah!

48:06.960 --> 48:09.640
Ah! Oh!

48:09.640 --> 48:11.960
# To the rescue. #

48:14.960 --> 48:20.320
Oh, Jove, I can't feel my bum.
Could you feel it before?

48:20.320 --> 48:22.960
Erm, not sure, actually.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.960
Stop going on about your numb bum,
you drama queen. You're fine.

48:25.960 --> 48:28.960
Argh! No, no, no. Come on, mate,
we need to keep moving.

48:28.960 --> 48:31.960
I can't do it. I can't go on.
OK, cool.

48:31.960 --> 48:33.960
We'll leave him here,
cos he's dead weight, in't he?

48:33.960 --> 48:35.960
That is not an awful idea, actually.
What? No way!

48:35.960 --> 48:38.960
You can't leave me.
We're a team. The deserter dudes.

48:38.960 --> 48:40.960
Hey, I didn't desert, I fell asleep.

48:40.960 --> 48:41.960
Best bros forever, you said.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.960
Yeah, that's when we
needed your help.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.960
A fair amount's changed since then.

48:45.960 --> 48:49.480
You can't leave me here to be
feasted upon by bears and ants!

48:49.480 --> 48:51.960
He's got a point, hasn't he?
Cos we could always eat him.

48:51.960 --> 48:52.960
Do not eat me!

48:52.960 --> 48:54.960
For one thing, I'd be very tough,

48:54.960 --> 48:57.800
sinewy meat owing to my high
muscle-to-fat ratio.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.960
Look, why don't Grumio
and I go for help

48:59.960 --> 49:01.160
while you stay with Aurelius?

49:01.160 --> 49:04.960
Holy Jove,
why have you forsaken me?!

49:04.960 --> 49:08.960
Right. Or I go for help
and you two stay with him.

49:08.960 --> 49:11.000
I'm not staying here with that twat.
What are you talking about?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.800
Just coming up with a plan, bro!
OK, right.

49:13.800 --> 49:16.960
Let's do papyrus, scissors, stone,
and the loser has to stay.

49:16.960 --> 49:18.960
You don't need to play,
we come as a two.

49:18.960 --> 49:20.960
I'll play for us, then.
Scissors always wins.

49:20.960 --> 49:22.960
And that fundamental
misunderstanding of the game

49:22.960 --> 49:24.960
is exactly why
I'll be playing for us.

49:24.960 --> 49:26.960
I think I'm dying, guys.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.800
Right, here we go.
BOTH: Papyrus, scissors, stone.

49:29.800 --> 49:33.960
Scissors! Ha! Bash, bash, bash.
Never listen to Grumio, you moron.

49:33.960 --> 49:37.160
Hang in there, Aurelius.
Jason will look after you. OK.

49:37.160 --> 49:40.960
Jason, will you sing to me,
please, bud?

49:40.960 --> 49:42.960
Don't be long, all right?

49:42.960 --> 49:44.960
Jason?
Yeah, I'm coming.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.960
I mean, can humans eat plants?

50:05.960 --> 50:07.960
What? Yeah, of course they can.

50:07.960 --> 50:09.320
Oh, fine then.

50:09.320 --> 50:12.960
Not ANY plants.
I meant spinach, for example.

50:12.960 --> 50:13.960
You can't just eat that!

50:13.960 --> 50:16.960
The old nature,
you confusing bastard.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.960
Can we keep going, please,
and not get distracted?

50:18.960 --> 50:21.160
Shit! It's a chicken.

50:21.160 --> 50:23.480
What? Where?
There.

50:23.480 --> 50:24.960
Right, I'm having you, lad.

50:24.960 --> 50:27.960
And then what? We can't cook it.
I'll have it raw, then.

50:27.960 --> 50:29.960
I only joined the army
for the free chicken anyway.

50:29.960 --> 50:31.960
We're meant to be getting help.

50:31.960 --> 50:34.960
Do not come between me and
a chicken, Marcus, I am warning you.

50:36.960 --> 50:38.960
Oh, go on, then. Be quick.

50:39.960 --> 50:43.000
One quick grabaroo
and it is teatime-for-me-time.

50:44.960 --> 50:46.960
Make that two quick grabaroos.

50:47.960 --> 50:51.640
CHICKEN CLUCKS

50:54.960 --> 50:56.960
Right. Well, that's at least 30.

50:56.960 --> 50:59.960
Three more grabaroos
and we're giving up, OK?

50:59.960 --> 51:01.960
Fine, just don't rush me.

51:05.960 --> 51:07.960
One.

51:08.960 --> 51:10.960
Two.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.960
Last one, right?

51:12.960 --> 51:14.960
I know. Just shh!

51:14.960 --> 51:18.480
Come on, son. This is the one.

51:18.480 --> 51:19.960
Argh!

51:19.960 --> 51:21.800
Oh, yes!

51:22.960 --> 51:24.960
Ha-ha!
I've got it!

51:24.960 --> 51:25.960
Oh, by Jove, you did it!

51:25.960 --> 51:27.480
Yes! Ha!

51:27.480 --> 51:30.160
# I got the chicken
I got the chicken

51:30.160 --> 51:32.960
# I got the chicken
He got the chicken

51:32.960 --> 51:34.960
# I got... #

51:34.960 --> 51:37.960
SINISTER MUSIC

51:39.160 --> 51:40.960
He got the chicken.

51:50.640 --> 51:53.960
# How happy is the shepherd

51:53.960 --> 51:56.960
# Who settles down to sleep

51:56.960 --> 51:59.960
# Because he is so knackered

51:59.960 --> 52:01.960
# From fucking all the sheep... #

52:01.960 --> 52:03.960
What? No, no,
I don't want the rude version.

52:03.960 --> 52:04.960
I only know the rude version.

52:04.960 --> 52:08.960
That's not exactly gonna soothe me,
is it? Thinking about bestiality.

52:08.960 --> 52:10.000
How's my bum looking?

52:11.960 --> 52:13.800
Ah!

52:13.800 --> 52:16.960
OK, don't panic.
All right, it's probably nothing.

52:16.960 --> 52:18.960
But it's gone a bit green.
Green?!

52:18.960 --> 52:21.960
Yeah. How's that nothing?!
Bums shouldn't be green.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.960
Oh, it must be infected.
What did I say? Don't panic.

52:23.960 --> 52:25.960
The boys will be back in a bit,
all right? Shushy bears.

52:25.960 --> 52:27.960
They won't! They've left us!

52:27.960 --> 52:29.960
We're all alone and green.

52:29.960 --> 52:32.000
# He wakes up in the morning... #

52:32.000 --> 52:33.960
Kiss me.
Whoa! What?

52:33.960 --> 52:35.960
Please kiss me.

52:35.960 --> 52:37.960
I just want to feel some human
tenderness before I die.

52:37.960 --> 52:40.320
No! Right, and not just
because I don't want to,

52:40.320 --> 52:41.960
but cos you are not gonna die.

52:41.960 --> 52:43.960
Right, no-one dies from green bums.
Of course they do!

52:43.960 --> 52:45.960
Bum rot. I've got bum rot.

52:45.960 --> 52:50.480
Look, tell my family
that they were proud of me.

52:50.480 --> 52:51.960
What?
Actually, no.

52:51.960 --> 52:53.800
Tell them to never
look under my bed.

52:53.800 --> 52:55.960
You tell them yourself
when you get back to Rome, OK?

52:55.960 --> 52:56.960
What's under your bed?

52:56.960 --> 52:59.960
Oh, you're a good bud, buddy,
but it's too late.

52:59.960 --> 53:02.640
I can feel death's
icy grip on my arse.

53:02.640 --> 53:05.960
No. No! No, you don't!

53:05.960 --> 53:09.960
Marcus! Grumio!
Come on. Where are you?!

53:09.960 --> 53:11.960
AURELIUS GROANS

53:11.960 --> 53:14.960
Right, come on.

53:14.960 --> 53:18.000
Ooh, what are you doing?
Saving your fucking life, boy.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.960
Argh!

53:32.320 --> 53:35.960
Oi, you, Roman scum!

53:35.960 --> 53:37.000
Jog on, you little shite.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.960
At least don't make it
worse for ourselves.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.960
Nah, it's just banter.

53:40.960 --> 53:43.960
OK, that's FAIRLY intense banter.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.960
Argh! Just kill me.

53:54.960 --> 53:56.960
Please, just put me
out of my misery.

53:56.960 --> 53:59.640
I'd rather not, mate.
I'm not even sure I'd know how to.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.960
Just push me off of something tall

54:01.960 --> 54:03.960
or sit on my face
to block my airways.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.960
Couldn't I just use my hands?

54:07.960 --> 54:08.960
Yes, you could, actually.

54:08.960 --> 54:11.320
I don't know why I suggested
the sitting method.

54:11.320 --> 54:12.960
I think I must be delirious.

54:12.960 --> 54:14.960
Ooh, argh!

54:14.960 --> 54:16.960
Urgh!

54:16.960 --> 54:19.960
I can hear my mother
calling me to dinner.

54:19.960 --> 54:21.960
I'm coming, Mummy.

54:21.960 --> 54:24.960
I can smell the wood
burning on the stove.

54:24.960 --> 54:26.640
Hang on, so can I.

54:27.960 --> 54:29.960
Look, there!

54:29.960 --> 54:30.960
Huh?

54:31.960 --> 54:36.960
GRUNTING AND PANTING

54:36.960 --> 54:39.960
Oh, oh! Get in!
Argh! We're saved!

54:39.960 --> 54:43.800
Well, unless they're Roman-hating
savages who want to kill us.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, I forgot about that.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.160
OK, you're on your own.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.960
Argh!
Good luck.

54:50.960 --> 54:52.800
Argh! You bastard!

54:52.800 --> 54:53.960
WOMAN: Hello?
Argh!

54:53.960 --> 54:56.960
Man. There is a man.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.960
He needs help.

54:58.960 --> 55:00.320
Ursula, fetch water.

55:00.320 --> 55:02.960
Cleo, Amara, Xanthe,
help me take him inside.

55:05.960 --> 55:07.960
Hi. Sorry,
there's actually two men.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.960
I also need help.

55:09.960 --> 55:12.480
Ha. Hi.

55:16.960 --> 55:18.960
Hey! Come off it!

55:19.960 --> 55:23.800
So, first of all, hello.

55:23.800 --> 55:25.960
Or, as you might say, salve.

55:25.960 --> 55:26.960
All right.
Hello.

55:26.960 --> 55:28.960
My name is Segimundus.

55:28.960 --> 55:32.960
I am spokesman
of the Carpi Council of Elders

55:32.960 --> 55:35.960
and I presume from your uniforms
and proximity to our gates

55:35.960 --> 55:40.960
that you are Roman spies sent out to
rescue your precious bird, no doubt.

55:40.960 --> 55:42.320
My eagle!

55:42.320 --> 55:43.960
Give me back me eagle at once!

55:43.960 --> 55:45.960
And my chicken an' all,
while you're at it.

55:45.960 --> 55:48.320
Grumio, don't. We couldn't
care less about the eagle.

55:48.320 --> 55:50.480
We're not even Roman soldiers,
really.

55:50.480 --> 55:51.960
No, so what is this, then?

55:51.960 --> 55:53.960
Are you on your way
to a fancy dress party, perhaps?

55:53.960 --> 55:55.960
CROWD CHUCKLES

55:55.960 --> 55:56.960
Ha! No, no.

55:56.960 --> 55:59.960
We were soldiers, obviously,
but we're not now, is my point.

55:59.960 --> 56:01.960
We deserted, you see.
I didn't. I fell asleep.

56:01.960 --> 56:04.960
Yeah, just let me do the talking.
We didn't want to join this war.

56:04.960 --> 56:07.320
I did, to give your lot a spanking
for invading our empire.

56:07.320 --> 56:08.480
Grumio, just shut up!

56:08.480 --> 56:10.960
There was no invasion.
That was fake news.

56:10.960 --> 56:12.960
A pretext for you
to steal our bauxite.

56:12.960 --> 56:15.320
Bauxite? What the fuck is bauxite?

56:15.320 --> 56:17.960
I think it's a naturally occurring,
I want to say, metal?

56:17.960 --> 56:20.960
It is a sedimentary rock
with high aluminium content.

56:20.960 --> 56:23.960
We have a number of large
and very valuable quarries

56:23.960 --> 56:26.960
that you people have lusted
after for some time now.

56:26.960 --> 56:28.960
That does make sense.
I always thought there was

56:28.960 --> 56:30.960
some shady mercenary motive
behind all this.

56:30.960 --> 56:33.640
Romans are far sneakier
than barbarians, in my opinion.

56:33.640 --> 56:37.000
Ahem! Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut.
We do not like the term "barbarian".

56:37.000 --> 56:40.960
It's a reductive label
which homogenises an array

56:40.960 --> 56:43.960
of diverse communities
and their unique identities.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.800
We call ourselves the Carpi tribe.

56:46.800 --> 56:48.160
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.

56:48.160 --> 56:49.960
I'm so sorry for being
so insensitive.

56:49.960 --> 56:52.800
Not at all. No, think of this
as a teachable moment.

56:52.800 --> 56:55.640
I will. Cross-cultural exchange
is fundamental to progress.

56:55.640 --> 56:57.960
We don't learn anything
if we live in a bubble. Indeed.

56:57.960 --> 57:00.960
And so that we can share this
knowledge with our countrymen,

57:00.960 --> 57:03.960
we'd love to be on our way.
Yes, I'm sure you would.

57:03.960 --> 57:07.960
But there's also one little thing
you should learn about the Carpi.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.960
It's what we do to our captives.

57:09.960 --> 57:12.960
Oh, aye, yeah. What do you do?
Do you take them for a tour?

57:12.960 --> 57:16.640
No, we disembowel them in honour
of our great god Zalmoxis.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.960
Oh, shit.
Right.

57:17.960 --> 57:19.960
The ceremony will take
place tomorrow evening

57:19.960 --> 57:21.960
before the entire village.

57:21.960 --> 57:24.640
CHEERING

57:26.960 --> 57:28.960
AURELIUS GROANS

57:28.960 --> 57:30.960
Apparently, the arrow went very deep

57:30.960 --> 57:32.960
because his bottom
is so soft and womanly.

57:32.960 --> 57:36.640
Yeah, totally. Not like mine.
My buns are rock hard.

57:36.640 --> 57:38.960
Arrow would have just pinged off,
probably.

57:38.960 --> 57:41.960
He may stay until he recovers.
Cool.

57:41.960 --> 57:43.960
All right. And what about...?
You may not. Yep.

57:43.960 --> 57:46.960
Aside from emergencies,
there are no men in the village.

57:46.960 --> 57:49.960
Oh, really? I didn't...
I didn't even notice that.

57:49.960 --> 57:51.160
What's that about, then?

57:51.160 --> 57:54.160
Our menfolk all left to fight
another tribe some years ago

57:54.160 --> 57:56.000
and never returned.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.960
No! That's... so sad.

57:59.960 --> 58:03.480
HE GROANS
It was sad, but we adapted.

58:03.480 --> 58:07.160
We trade spices with our neighbours.
We are skilled in combat.

58:07.160 --> 58:10.960
We no longer need men.
Come on!

58:10.960 --> 58:13.480
I'm sure you need a bloke
sometimes to, like, you know,

58:13.480 --> 58:15.960
open a jar or, like,
get something from a higher shelf,

58:15.960 --> 58:16.960
you know, like a jar,

58:16.960 --> 58:18.960
or to put the shelf up
to put the jars on.

58:18.960 --> 58:22.960
Amazingly, we handle all
jar-related tasks ourselves.

58:22.960 --> 58:24.960
OK.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.960
I guess it's another night
in the forest for me, then.

58:27.960 --> 58:29.960
I hope the wolves
have had their tea.

58:32.960 --> 58:35.960
We do have one other use for men.

58:35.960 --> 58:36.960
Oh?

58:36.960 --> 58:42.960
Occasionally,
we may keep one as a... concubine.

58:42.960 --> 58:45.960
A what? Concubine?
What's that, like a hedgehog?

58:45.960 --> 58:47.960
Not quite, no.

58:49.960 --> 58:51.960
Ah! Ah!

58:54.960 --> 58:57.160
I'm Jason, by the way.
Silence!

58:57.160 --> 58:58.800
You have no name now.

58:58.800 --> 59:00.960
You are here for sexual congress,
Roman, THAT'S all!

59:00.960 --> 59:03.000
OK, cool. I can do that.

59:04.960 --> 59:07.960
Oh, that's better. Thank you.

59:07.960 --> 59:09.960
Now tie them to the post, please,
Dromichaetes.

59:09.960 --> 59:12.960
OK, great.
Just to be safe.

59:12.960 --> 59:15.160
So that you don't... sneak off.

59:15.160 --> 59:17.960
How is that? Not too tight, I hope.

59:17.960 --> 59:20.960
No, no. You're grand.
It's a nice, soft rope, actually.

59:20.960 --> 59:21.960
Yes, it's made from angora wool.

59:21.960 --> 59:25.960
We Carpi are famous for our
civilised treatment of prisoners.

59:25.960 --> 59:28.000
Yeah. You ARE disembowelling us.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.960
Yes, BEFORE execution, I mean.

59:29.960 --> 59:31.960
Yes, it's enshrined
in our constitution

59:31.960 --> 59:33.960
that we offer our captives

59:33.960 --> 59:36.960
a final meal of their choosing,
for example.

59:36.960 --> 59:38.960
Oh, aye? How many courses?

59:38.960 --> 59:41.960
One.
One? Call yourselves civilised?

59:41.960 --> 59:44.960
May I take your order? Well, it
doesn't really matter, does it?

59:44.960 --> 59:47.960
I'm not gonna get to digest it.
Just... give me an egg sandwich.

59:47.960 --> 59:50.000
Is that on white, brown or seeded?

59:50.000 --> 59:52.160
Brown's fine.

59:53.160 --> 59:55.960
I'll take a lobster bisque.
Of course you will.

59:55.960 --> 59:57.960
I'm going out in style, son.
Very well.

59:57.960 --> 1:00:02.320
One egg sandwich on brown
and one lobster... bisque.

1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:07.160
I'll speak to the chef,
and you prepare the altar.

1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:12.000
Egg sandwich on brown bread
for your final meal?

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:13.960
When they open up them bowels,

1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:15.960
they should be seeing
more than some shitty sandwich.

1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:19.480
Unlike you, Grumio, I've got more
on my mind than just food right now.

1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:21.000
In fact,
it was you chasing that chicken

1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.960
that got us in this fucking mess.
You didn't have to come with me.

1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:26.960
We were chained together!
You dragged me along,

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:29.160
which pretty much sums up
our entire relationship.

1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:31.480
I know. You've been
holding me back for years.

1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:33.960
What? Holding you back?!
It's not about you, Grumio.

1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:36.000
You're MY slave.
Don't remind me!

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.320
I wish I weren't.
I'd have ditched you yonks ago.

1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:41.800
And I wish my parents had left you
on that bloody hillside. Yeah?

1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:42.960
You and me both!

1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:47.960
Ordinarily,
I would storm off at this point,

1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:50.960
but being as I can't,
I am going to sit down.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:00.960
Aw...
KIDS LAUGH

1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:02.960
Yeah! Roman scum!

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:04.960
LAUGHTER

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:07.960
COCKEREL CROWS

1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:17.960
Hi.
Hi.

1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:22.960
Hi.

1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:26.960
Hi!

1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:32.960
Mm. Thank you.

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:34.960
Knock, knock.
How's the patient doing?

1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:36.000
Much better, thank you.

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.320
Really? Are you sure?
You still look well peaky.

1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:40.960
What?
No, I'm ready and raring, mate.

1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:43.320
Nah, look, listen. You rest up
just a few more days, right?

1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:44.960
Don't wanna risk
getting another green bum.

1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:48.960
But we need to go and find Marcus
and Grumio. Our best bros, forever.

1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:52.960
Mm, do we, though? I mean, they're
probably fine. They're handy guys.

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:55.960
You just don't wanna leave cos
we've found a tribe full of women.

1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:58.320
But I...

1:01:58.320 --> 1:01:59.960
Well, yes. Yeah.
Obviously.

1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:02.960
But this is, like,
our dream situation.

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:04.960
Not really. None of them fancy me.
Oh, come on...

1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:07.160
One of 'em will. A bit. Maybe.

1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:08.960
There's, like, 50 of them.

1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:10.000
That's not enough.

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.960
The odds are still
stacked against me. I need more.

1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:14.960
What about the old one?
I've not met an old one.

1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:16.960
That's cos
you've been cooped up in here.

1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:18.320
You need to get out there,
make an effort.

1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:19.960
You are the second hottest guy
in this village.

1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:21.960
Work it.

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:30.960
Hello again.

1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:34.960
So, I talked to the chef,
and, er, he can't get you lobster,

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:35.960
because it's Sunday,

1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:39.960
and as we are in the heat of July,
he likes the seafood to be fresh.

1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:41.960
As do I. I'm happy to wait.

1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:43.960
Yes, but we are not, I'm afraid.

1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:46.960
The sacrifice is this evening, so
you have to choose something else.

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:48.960
I've already chosen the bisque.

1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:50.960
The chef does
an excellent confit duck.

1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:52.960
Oh, I don't give a shit, mate.

1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:55.960
My lobster bisque is enshrined
in your constitution, you said.

1:02:55.960 --> 1:02:58.000
Or are you Carpi
not civilised after all?

1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:01.960
Er, which Sunday in July is it,
out of interest?

1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:03.960
It is the 21st. Why do you ask?

1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:06.960
My birthday's the 22nd.
Ah. I'm, er...

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:08.160
gonna be 30 tomorrow.

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:09.960
Oh, many happy returns.
Thanks.

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:11.480
But I'm afraid you won't.

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:13.960
The chef has no problem
with your egg sandwich,

1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:16.800
and you will still be sacrificed
this evening.

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:18.800
Come on, mate.
He'll have the bisque as well.

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:22.640
He's changed his mind, haven't you?
Yes, I have. Thank you.

1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:25.960
On reflection, I'd also
like to go out in style.

1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:28.960
Fine!

1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:30.640
You have one more day.

1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:36.800
Ha! Bloody hell,
I can't believe that worked.

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:38.960
Cheers, Grumio. I guess your
lifelong obsession with food

1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:39.960
does have its uses after all.

1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:42.960
Well, let's just try
and give you a birthday to remember.

1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:44.640
Oh, incoming!
Hm? Argh!

1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:46.960
Ha-ha! Missed me!

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:47.960
In your face, fuckhead.

1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:50.960
You barbarian bastards!
Ha-ha!

1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:52.960
Ha-ha!

1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:56.960
BOTH GRUNT
IN SATISFACTION

1:03:59.960 --> 1:04:01.960
Um...

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:05.960
Now that I've, er,
performed my duty, my lady,

1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:09.800
do you want me to F off, as per,
or...?

1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:10.960
No.
No?

1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:13.960
You can stay this time, Jason.

1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:15.800
I wish to hold you for a while.

1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:18.960
What, like a cuddle?
No, nothing like a cuddle. Just...

1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:20.960
a hold.
Oh, OK.

1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:22.960
Got it.

1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:24.960
Did you just call me Jason?
Yeah, I did. What of it?

1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:29.160
You may call me Barbronelda,
if you wish.

1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:31.960
OK, sure. Yeah.

1:04:31.960 --> 1:04:33.960
Barbro...
It's a bit of a mouthful, innit?

1:04:33.960 --> 1:04:36.320
It's beautiful, don't get me wrong,
but...

1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:40.480
what if I shortened it to Barbie?
Or Babs?

1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:41.960
No, not Barbie.
Mm.

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:45.960
But I don't hate Babs.

1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:47.960
Give us a cuddle, then, Babs.

1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:50.800
Hm!

1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:52.320
Ahem.

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.960
Back in your corner, Roman!

1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:55.960
Yes, boss.

1:04:55.960 --> 1:04:59.960
News, my lady,
which may concern your concubine.

1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:02.960
Whilst selling pepper to the Carpi,
we saw two Roman prisoners.

1:05:03.960 --> 1:05:05.960
They're being prepared
for sacrifice.

1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:07.960
What did they look like?

1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:10.800
One had a big nose,

1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:14.160
and the other resembled
a tiny button mushroom.

1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:22.960
I actually play the bugle
and the lute,

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:25.960
so I'm highly skilled
with my fingers and my tongue,

1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:27.960
if you know what I'm saying.
SHE CHUCKLES

1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:28.960
Aurelius!
You do?

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:31.960
I love the feathers, by the way...
Aurelius!

1:05:31.960 --> 1:05:33.960
Come here.
Sorry, one second, babe. What?

1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:35.960
Marcus and Grumio
have been taken prisoner.

1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:37.160
Like, we need to bust a move.

1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:39.960
I mean, do we, though?
What?

1:05:39.960 --> 1:05:40.960
Well, they're handy guys.
And, you know,

1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:43.320
you were right, actually.
My bum's still not 100%,

1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:44.960
so I should probably just stay here.

1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:47.960
Oh, you're getting some heat
off the old dear, are you?

1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:50.960
Her name's Zena, and yes, I am.
Major heat.

1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:51.960
I can't leave now.

1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:54.960
But, mate, they'll be gutted, right?
And I don't just mean disappointed.

1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:56.960
I mean, actually gutted.
Like, in the guts.

1:05:56.960 --> 1:05:59.640
Come on, Aurelius, they need us.

1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:01.960
Grr! Cock-blocking, again!

1:06:01.960 --> 1:06:02.960
HE SIGHS

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:04.960
Fine. She'd only have humped me
and dumped me.

1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:07.960
Yeah, definitely.
Right, come on, let's get tooled up.

1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:36.960
Oh, mate, the beard's got to go.

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:39.160
No can do, bro.
It's the source of my strength.

1:06:39.160 --> 1:06:40.640
Our secret weapon.

1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:42.960
All right. Well, in that case,
keep it a secret,

1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:44.480
all right?
All right.

1:06:45.960 --> 1:06:46.960
Good luck, Roman.

1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:48.960
Oh, thank you.

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:52.960
And, like, thanks for having me.
In every sense.

1:06:53.960 --> 1:06:55.960
I'll miss you, Babs.

1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:57.960
As will I.

1:06:57.960 --> 1:07:02.960
Your enthusiasm for the work
was... admirable.

1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:04.960
Well, look, it was my pleasure.

1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:07.960
It was the best job I've ever had,
honestly.

1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:16.000
Take care, now.

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:17.960
OK, yeah.

1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:20.960
Bye, then.

1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:38.960
# Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:42.160
# Happy birthday, Marcu-u-u-u-s

1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:43.960
# Happy birthday. #
Indeed.

1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:45.960
Happy birthday to you,

1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:49.960
and also,
happy death day to you both.

1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:51.480
Ah, ah, ah -

1:07:51.480 --> 1:07:52.960
hang on, mate.

1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:55.960
Where's the tarragon? You can't
have a bisque without tarragon.

1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:58.480
That IS savage. He is right.
You'll have to kill us tomorrow.

1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:03.960
No! No tarragon, no more stalling.
You eat, then you die.

1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:07.960
Oh, oh...

1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:11.960
tarragon or not,
this chef has played a blinder. Mmm!

1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:15.960
We should probably eat a bit slower,
though.

1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:18.640
The sooner we finish,
the sooner we die, remember?

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:21.960
I'll try, Marcus,
but it's so bloody tasty.

1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:30.160
You know, even though
we are being executed later,

1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:31.960
I've had way worse birthdays
than this.

1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:35.160
Tell me about it. Remember when your
parents got you that creepy clown?

1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:37.960
How could I not?
I sat on his lap for three hours.

1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:39.960
GRUMIO LAUGHS

1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:41.960
Grumio, please slow down.

1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:44.960
Oh, fuck me, this is torture!

1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:58.160
Stop!

1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:06.960
Hi. Hi.
Can we come in, please?

1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:10.160
What's in the cart?

1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:13.800
Oh, just a bit of pepper, handsome.

1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:16.960
We could all use some spice
in our lives, eh?

1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:26.640
OK, you can go in.

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:29.960
Where the fuck did that come from?
I don't know. I have no idea.

1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:42.960
Wh-Whoa, hang on.
You can't just leave it like that.

1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:44.960
That's terrible parking.
Mate, we're women.

1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:46.960
Think about it.
Oh, yes. Clever.

1:09:46.960 --> 1:09:49.320
I mean, deeply sexist, but still...

1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:52.640
OK, right, we'll have a nosy round,
find out where they're holding them,

1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:55.960
and then we'll come back
for the blades.

1:09:55.960 --> 1:09:57.800
Stop!

1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:00.960
I want to buy some pepper.

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:03.960
Oh! Yeah, course.

1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:06.320
Yeah, so, how much for one sack,
please?

1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:08.960
Erm, well,
how much do you usually pay?

1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:11.960
Oh, sometimes six gulden.
You know, sometimes seven.

1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:13.960
Six gulden is fine.
Ah, great.

1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:17.320
Oh... Can you girls break a 20?

1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:19.960
Er, I'll tell you what,
you can have it for free.

1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:21.960
We're doing a little promotion.
No, really? Yes.

1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:24.000
Thank you. Generous and beautiful.

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.960
What next?
Stop it!

1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:28.960
Charmer. Oh, no, no, no.
Come here, I'll help.

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:30.960
I can't... No, I can't have a lady
hauling a heavy sack for me.

1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:32.960
It's fine. You're quite old.

1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:34.960
No, no. Really, I insist.
Mate, let go!

1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:36.960
HE COUGHS

1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:40.960
Why is your cart full of swords?

1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:41.960
HE SNEEZES

1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:43.960
Oh! Guards!

1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:45.960
Guards!
Aurelius, we're on!

1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:48.960
Ah... Hang on a sec,
I need to sneeze...

1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:52.960
Ah, forget it.
HE SNEEZES

1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:55.960
Hey, mate, have you got any bread
to mop up the dregs?

1:10:55.960 --> 1:10:59.000
No. Your meal is over
and you will now be sacrificed,

1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.960
along with these two.

1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:02.640
Oh, God, really?
All right, boys?

1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:05.960
All right, Jase? It's not so bad.
You get to choose your last meal.

1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:08.960
No, no. That rule was removed
from our constitution.

1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:10.960
It was, sadly, open to abuse.

1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:18.480
What are you doing here?
And like that?

1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:21.640
Well, we came to save you,
didn't we? Ah, wicked. Cheers!

1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:22.960
Yes. I mean, we failed, obviously.

1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:24.960
Well, it's the thought that counts,
in't it?

1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:26.960
Hey, it's his 30th birthday,
by the way.

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:28.960
Oh, sweet! Well, happy birthday.

1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:30.960
Yeah, cheers.
Glad you could make it.

1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:33.960
# Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:35.960

CHATTER, LAUGHTER

1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:02.960
All right! He did it!

1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:05.960
Mighty Zalmoxis,

1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:08.960
we humbly offer you
this sacrifice today.

1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:11.800
CROWD: Yeah!

1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:13.960
Which of you would like to go first?

1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:14.960
Oh, bloody hell.

1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:16.960
I don't much fancy
seeing your lot's innards,

1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:18.960
but I don't wanna cop it first,
neither.

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:20.960
Yeah, sort of lose-lose, really,
innit?

1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:22.960
I'll do it. I'll go first.
I'm the oldest.

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:25.960
You're not, actually. I am. I'm 39.

1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:26.960
What? You're 39?
Are you?!

1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:29.960
Yeah. Why you hanging round with us,
then, you creepy old nonce?

1:12:29.960 --> 1:12:31.960
I didn't realise
you were a fucking adult.

1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:33.960
Yeah, because I look late 20s, max.
Thank you very much.

1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:35.320
Compliment taken.
Come on.

1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:38.960
It does not matter who goes first.
You are all going to die.

1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:40.960
Shit! OK, er...

1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:44.960
I guess, bye, then.
See you in the afterlife, ideally.

1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:48.960
And with this heretic Roman's
entrails...

1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:52.960
..we honour thee!

What...?
Oh, her name's Barbronelda.

1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:28.320
Yeah, we've been hooking up
the last couple of days.

1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:30.960
Sorry, so while we were held
prisoner, you've been busy humping?

1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:33.160
Yeah, well, I was a prisoner too.
But just, like, a sex one.

1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:34.960
Course you were.
Nice one, son!

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:37.960
I know! This whole time, I thought
I wanted to get some booty,

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.960
when actually,
I wanna BE the booty.

1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:41.960
Wow. How profound (!)

1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:44.640
Guys, can we discuss this later,
please?

1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:45.960
Kill the Romans!

1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:48.800
Kill them!

1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:10.960
Thanks for coming to save me.

1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:15.960
If anyone's gonna disembowel
my concubine, it's going to be me.

1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:17.960
Stay at my rear.
Always.

1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:19.960

1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:28.960

1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:48.960
Don't stop now!
I want my bloody eagle. Why?!

1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:51.960
It's just a lump of metal. Yeah,
that them bastards nicked off me.

1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:53.960
I'll 'ave it back
with a quick grabaroo.

1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:54.960
No. No more grabaroos!

1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:57.160
Hey, you do you, soft lad.
I'm going in.

1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:58.960
What? Please, Grumio!

1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:01.960
It's not worth it!
Just obey me, for once in your life!

1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:08.960
Well, I'm going, Grumio.
I'll see you outside, OK?

1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:10.960
Come on, let's get out of here.
What?

1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:16.960
Stop! Hand that over at once.

1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:19.960
Get to fuck, mate.
That eagle is a beacon of hope

1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:22.960
for all of us who refuse
to bow down to Roman oppression.

1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:24.640

Oh, not the bisque.

1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:47.960

Argh!

1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:49.960
I can't believe it's happened again.

1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:51.960
I know. It's like you're TRYING
to get shot in the arse.

1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:53.960
I've got three holes back there now.

1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:55.960
You could pick me up
like a bowling ball.

1:16:55.960 --> 1:16:57.320
Well, d'you want me to yank it out?

1:16:57.320 --> 1:16:59.960
No, no!
Can you ask her to do it, please?

1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:02.960
I don't want another
green bum situation, thank you.

1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:07.960
So, now you're no longer
honouring the mighty Zalmoxis

1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:09.960
with your entrails,
what are your plans for the day?

1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:13.480
Er... I guess we need
to get back to Rome.

1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:16.480
But despite popular wisdom,
very few roads seem to lead there.

1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:18.960
Ow, God, that stings!

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:19.960
Don't be a baby.

1:17:19.960 --> 1:17:23.160
You know, your evil empire is
stationed about half a day that way.

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:25.960
Hitch a ride with them.
Yeah, that's the thing.

1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:29.960
We're not exactly that popular
with our evil empire.

1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:31.800
Yet.

1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:56.960
APPLAUSE
Found the eagle. No big deal, lads.

1:17:56.960 --> 1:17:58.800
Just bringing it home to Rome.

1:17:58.800 --> 1:17:59.960
APPLAUSE

1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:01.960
MAN: Well done, boys.

1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:07.960
Let us through, fellas.
Respect the eagle, please.

1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:10.000
You? YOU found the eagle?

1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:13.960
Yeah. Ah... You can buy me a drink
later to say thanks.

1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:15.960
Yeah! Well done, boys!

1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:23.960
Jove be praised.

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:26.000
Where on earth was it?
The Carpi tribe had taken it, sir.

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.960
Just say barbarians. I can't keep up
with all the weird names.

1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:31.320
We snuck in, we duffed 'em up
and we grabbed our big bird there.

1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:34.320
Marvellous. Well, jolly good work.
I'm absolutely thrilled about this.

1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:35.960
You're welcome.
Yes.

1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:36.960
You shall now be executed.

1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:38.960
Not again!
What?!

1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:41.160
You're deserters.
Ergo, you must be crucified.

1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:42.960
I mean, I guess
that beats disembowelment.

1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:45.960
Barely. Come on,
we got the bastard eagle back.

1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:47.960
Yeah, you should be giving us
a medal, if anything.

1:18:47.960 --> 1:18:49.960
Also, I'm not sure I've forgiven you

1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:51.960
for clicking my neck.
Oh, look, mate...

1:18:51.960 --> 1:18:53.960
"Mate"?
General, sir.

1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:54.960
We know that there was no invasion

1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:58.960
and this war was waged entirely
to get hold of more bauxite.

1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:00.960
Did you know about that?
About the bauxite?

1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:02.640
Yes, of course.
Did you?

1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:04.960
Well,
maybe the Roman people should too.

1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:06.960
Oh, the plebs in Rome
don't care why wars are waged,

1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:09.000
as long as we win them
and bring home some funny animals.

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:12.480
That is true. So let's erect the
crucifixes and get this over with.

1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:14.160
Oh, sorry, sir, I meant to say.

1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:17.960
The crosses have all been dismantled
and packed onto the wagons.

1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:20.960
All right, fine. You're free to go.
But I'm discharging the lot of you

1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:21.960
the minute we arrive in Rome,

1:19:21.960 --> 1:19:24.640
and you must promise never
to set foot in the army again.

1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:25.960
Yeah, deal.
Yeah.

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:28.960
Hang on.
Were there not four deserters?

1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:30.960
There were, sir.
Ergo, one is missing.

1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:32.960
Yes, sir.

1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:36.960
Jason Brindisi.
He died liberating the eagle.

1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:40.960
Oh. Well, that's one less
mouth to feed on our journey home.

1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:43.960
But also very sad.

1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:48.960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:52.160
Hiya. Yep.

1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:53.960
Hello.

1:19:56.960 --> 1:19:58.960
We had a good war, on balance.

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:01.960
Well, it was terrifying and horrible

1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:04.960
and waged purely to further
the economic interest of the state,

1:20:04.960 --> 1:20:06.640
but, yeah, you know, we didn't die.

1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:07.960
Like I say, on balance.

1:20:07.960 --> 1:20:09.960
Salve, Grumio.

1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:11.960
All right, Landlord?

1:20:11.960 --> 1:20:14.960
Hey, hey, hey, now we're veterans,
we'll probs get our old flat back.

1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:18.960
Bagsy Jason's old room,
if that's cool with you guys?

1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:21.960
Yeah, all right. You're in.

1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:23.320
Yes! I'm in!

1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:25.960
I'm finally in!
HE LAUGHS

1:20:25.960 --> 1:20:26.960
Whoo!

1:20:28.640 --> 1:20:30.960
Yeah, so sorry to keep you again.

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:33.960
Believe it or not, we got caught
in another military parade.

1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:35.160
You're over three months late.

1:20:35.160 --> 1:20:36.960
And in a military campaign.
Yeah.

1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:38.320
Right. OK.

1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:41.960
Well, in the interim,
your slave licence has been approved

1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:42.960
and is now ready to sign.

1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:44.960
Go on, then.

1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:47.960
Do you have a manumission form,
in fact?

1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:50.960
Why?
Do you want that one instead now?

1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:51.960
I do, yeah.

1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:53.960
Thanks.

1:20:55.800 --> 1:20:57.960
What's this green one, then?
It's manumission.

1:20:57.960 --> 1:20:59.960
As in, freedom.

1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:02.960
You are no longer a slave.

1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:04.960
You what?

1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:07.960
Are you yanking my chain?
You're freeing me?

1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:09.960
Yeah.

1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:13.960
Well, all this licence business
is such a bloody faff, isn't it?

1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:18.160
And also, when that barbarian
was about to cut you in half

1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:20.960
and I was home free,

1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:22.960
I wasn't coming back for my slave,
I was..

1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:26.960
..coming back for my brother.

1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:33.960
My selfish, lazy,
greedy scrotum of a brother.

1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:50.960
There is a queue, you realise?
Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, yeah.

1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:53.960
Now you are a free man,

1:21:53.960 --> 1:21:55.960
you can obviously fuck off
and never see me again.

1:21:55.960 --> 1:21:57.960
Mm-hm. I mean,
it's nice to have the option,

1:21:57.960 --> 1:22:00.960
but I reckon
I'll stick around for a bit.

1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:03.960
So... What shall we do now, then?

1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:05.960
Well, now that I'm 30,

1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:07.960
I should probably
focus on settling down,

1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:10.960
starting a career, get a mortgage,
that sort of thing.

1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:14.000
Right, cos I were gonna suggest
getting some free chicken.

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.960
Yeah, that's much better.
All right. Come on.

1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:20.960
# I can see clearly
Now the rain is gone... #

1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:23.960
..great big numbers, like,
massive, massive chickens. Oh, yeah?

1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:24.960
Erm, Greece, it was.

1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:28.480
And there were all these different
condiments...

1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:31.960
# I can see all obstacles
In my way... #

1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:34.640
Spicy, spicy. Get me so excited...

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:39.960
# Gone are the dark clouds
That had me blind

1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:42.960
# It's gonna be a bright
Bright

1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:46.960
# Bright Bright
Sunshiny day

1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:55.960
# I think I can make it
Now the pain is gone

1:22:57.960 --> 1:23:03.320
# All of the bad feelings
Have disappeared

1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:08.480
# Here is that rainbow
I've been praying for... #

1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:11.960
HE CHUCKLES
Yes!

1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:13.960
# It's gonna be a bright
Bright

1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:17.960
# Bright Bright
Sunshiny day

1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:26.960
# Look all around
There's nothing but blue skies

1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:33.000
# Look straight ahead
There's nothing but blue skies

1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:45.960
# I can see clearly
Now the rain is gone

1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:52.000
# I can see all obstacles in my way

1:23:54.960 --> 1:24:00.960
# Gone are the dark clouds
That had me blind

1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:03.960
# It's gonna be a bright
Bright

1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:07.480
# Bright Bright
Sunshiny day. #

1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:09.960
