00:46.714 --> 00:48.816
WELL, YOU'RE YOUNG.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.251
- WHAT--WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:50.284 --> 00:51.752
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.655
IF YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN
BEFORE 30,

00:54.688 --> 00:55.789
YOU HAVE NO HEART.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.092
AND IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT
AFTER 30,

00:58.126 --> 00:59.260
YOU HAVE NO BRAIN.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.529
- I'M 34.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.799
- CAN I USE YOUR BATHROOM

01:05.833 --> 01:07.668
BEFORE I HEAD CROSS TOWN?

01:07.701 --> 01:09.170
- SECOND DOOR ON YOUR LEFT.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.777

YOU KNOW, AT LEAST
I WAS HONEST.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.651
HOW OLD'S YOUR KID, ANNIE?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.853
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:30.691 --> 01:32.660
[gasps]

01:32.693 --> 01:34.528
- HER SCREAMS WOKE UP
GOLDILOCKS HERE,

01:34.562 --> 01:35.829
HE TRIED TO BOLT BUCK NAKED,

01:35.863 --> 01:37.598
BUT THE GIRL'S DATE
BROUGHT HIM DOWN.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.633
- I HAD MY FIRST DRINK
LAST NIGHT, OKAY?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.335
LESSON LEARNED.
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?

01:41.369 --> 01:42.503

01:43.604 --> 01:45.673
- UNFINISHED BUSINESS
NIGHT WATCH DROPPED ON US.

01:45.706 --> 01:46.640

01:46.674 --> 01:47.908
WOMAN WOKE UP,
FOUND HIM NAKED

01:47.941 --> 01:49.543
PASSED OUT IN HER BED.

01:49.577 --> 01:50.611
- I CAN EXPLAIN THAT.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.180
- JUST DON'T.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.347
YOU NEED A PARENT PRESENT.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.882
- WHEN NIGHT WATCH
CONTACTED HIS MOTHER,

01:54.915 --> 01:56.517
SHE SAID LET HIM SPEND
THE NIGHT IN JAIL.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.918
- AND YOU WONDER WHY
I WAS DRIVEN TO DRINK.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.720
- THAT KID WAS TRYING
TO RAPE ME.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.922
- DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF, LADY.
- YOU CAN'T BE HERE.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.457
- I FOUND THIS
IN MY CLOSET THIS MORNING

02:03.491 --> 02:04.758
WITH AN EMPTY
BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.328
YOU HID IN MY CLOSET
TO ATTACK ME.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.765
- NINTH GRADE SCIENCE.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.368
PROPERTY OF HUNTER MAZELON.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.237
DUCT TAPE.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.505
PANTYHOSE.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.307
- SHE'S PARANOID.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.509
- REALLY?

02:23.844 --> 02:25.346
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WITH THAT?

02:25.379 --> 02:28.582
- IT'S COOL.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.625
[dramatic music]

02:37.658 --> 02:45.666
*

03:23.571 --> 03:24.905
- YOU'RE STAYING IN HERE
TILL YOUR MOM SHOWS UP.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.807
- SCREW YOU.
I'M CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.742
- THEN WHY WERE YOU HIDING
IN A WOMAN'S CLOSET?

03:28.776 --> 03:30.378
- THIS IS BULL.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.246
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING, PAL,
IF I HAD MY WAY,

03:32.280 --> 03:33.714
I'D BE THROWING YOU
IN THE CAGE

03:33.747 --> 03:36.517
WITH THE ADULT SKELS YOU'RE
TRYING SO HARD TO BECOME.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.319
- BRING IT.
- WELL, THE RULES SAY

03:38.352 --> 03:40.621
I HAVE TO KEEP YOU IN
A CHILD-APPROPRIATE AREA.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.856
- [scoffs]
THESE CASE FILES?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.858
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.727
JUNIOR, FACE THE WALL.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.396
- YOU GONNA GIVE ME
A CAVITY SEARCH NOW?

03:48.429 --> 03:49.997
- JUST STAND STILL.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.566
- [scoffs]

03:52.600 --> 03:54.468
HEY, THAT'S NOT COOL!
DON'T TOUCH ME THERE, MAN!

03:54.502 --> 03:57.271
I NEED AN ADULT IN HERE!
QUIT TOUCHING MY JUNK!

03:57.305 --> 04:01.709
- DETECTIVE,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.544
- YEAH, THE KID'S A SMARTASS.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.878
THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

04:04.912 --> 04:06.747
- NO.
- THEN WHY'D YOU YELL THAT?

04:06.780 --> 04:08.749
- I FREAKED OUT.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.984
IT'S MY FIRST TIME
BEING ARRESTED.

04:14.522 --> 04:15.923
- WELL, I WAS JUST
HEADING OUT ON PATROL.

04:15.956 --> 04:16.957
YOU NEED ME
TO SEND SOMEBODY IN?

04:16.990 --> 04:19.827
- UH--
- HMM?

04:19.860 --> 04:21.061
HE'S TALKING TO YOU,
NOT ME.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.431
- NO, NO, WE'RE COOL.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.598
- WE'RE COOL.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.635
FACE THE WALL.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.403
YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH CHARGES AGAINST YOU?

04:29.437 --> 04:30.838
NOW YOU'RE MAKING
FALSE ALLEGATIONS?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.640
- IT WAS A JOKE, MAN.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.809
I'M SURE NEITHER OF US ARE
IN HERE TO JACK ANYONE UP.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.445
- WELL, YOU SIT TIGHT.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.046
I'LL SEE YOU UPSTAIRS
WHEN MOMMY GETS HERE.

04:39.079 --> 04:46.387
- I CAN'T WAIT.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.521
- EXCUSE ME.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.423
THEY HAVE KEPT ME WAITING
DOWNSTAIRS FOR 40 MINUTES.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.459
CAN YOU PLEASE FIND OUT WHERE
HUNTER MAZELON IS BEING HELD?

04:51.492 --> 04:52.493
I'M HIS MOTHER.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.927
- DETECTIVES
BENSON AND STABLER

04:53.961 --> 04:55.763
ARE THE PRIMARIES
ON THAT CASE.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.765
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT
WHILE I LOCATE THEM.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.066
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.902
- FEEL FREE TO STAND
IF YOU PREFER.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.672
- SPECIAL VICTIMS IS
A SEX CRIME UNIT, RIGHT?

05:04.705 --> 05:06.474
HUNTER WAS PICKED UP
ON A KID'S PRANK.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.709
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

05:08.742 --> 05:10.611
- THERE'S BEEN
A NEW DEVELOPMENT.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.012
- DID SOMEONE
DO SOMETHING TO HIM?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.847
- YOUR SON ISN'T THE VICTIM.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.983
- WHAT--
THAT'S INSANE.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.018
HUNTER MAZELON.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.920
YOU MUST HAVE GOTTEN HIM
MIXED UP WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.088
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.357
BUT JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,

05:23.391 --> 05:25.859
WHY WEREN'T YOU CONCERNED ABOUT
HIS WHEREABOUTS LAST NIGHT?

05:25.893 --> 05:27.961
- WHEN THE POLICE CALLED
I WAS FURIOUS,

05:27.995 --> 05:30.731
AND I TOLD THEM TO KEEP HIM
AND TEACH HIM A LESSON.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.733
LET HIM THINK ABOUT
WHAT HE'S PUT ME THROUGH.

05:32.766 --> 05:33.967
- THE ARRESTING OFFICER

05:34.001 --> 05:35.969
DIDN'T CONTACT YOU
TILL 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.771
WHERE DID YOU THINK
HUNTER WAS BEFORE THAT?

05:37.805 --> 05:39.640
- SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT HIS FRIEND JAKE'S

05:39.673 --> 05:42.576
WORKING ON
A SCIENCE PROJECT.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.979
- HOW COULD HUNTER DO THAT?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.781
THE SCIENCE FAIR'S MONDAY.
WE'RE DEAD.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.016
- YEAH, YOUR NEXT-DOOR
NEIGHBOR ANNIE MEYERS

05:49.049 --> 05:50.584
IS ALL CHOKED UP
ABOUT THAT.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.952
- DID YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS, JAKE?

05:51.985 --> 05:53.454
- NO.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.822
- HUNTER JIMMIED OPEN
HER SERVICE ENTRANCE.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.857
HE PROBABLY NEEDED
A LOOKOUT.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.692
- YOU TWO PARTNERS
IN MORE THAN SCIENCE?

05:58.726 --> 06:00.160
- NO, WE'RE BARELY
PARTNERS IN THAT.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.829
HUNTER SHOWED UP HIGH
AND BAILED EARLY.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.564
- WHY ARE YOU FRIENDS
WITH A BOY LIKE THAT?

06:03.597 --> 06:04.598
- I'M NOT.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.166
WE WERE THE ONLY TWO LOSERS
WITHOUT A PARTNER.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.901
THEY PAIRED US UP.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.770
- OKAY, THEN WHY'D HE TARGET
YOUR NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR ANNIE?

06:09.803 --> 06:11.004
SHE SAID SHE NEVER MET HIM.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.106
- SHE WAS LEAVING HER APARTMENT
WHEN HE GOT HERE LAST NIGHT.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.409
HE MADE DIRTY GESTURES
WHILE SHE WAS WALKING AWAY.

06:15.443 --> 06:18.011
- YOU EVER SEE HUNTER
EXHIBIT ANY VIOLENT STREAK?

06:18.045 --> 06:20.848
- JUST ON HOSNI MURIBBIT.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.116
OUR MUMMIFICATION PROJECT.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.018
THE FIRST STEP IS
TO PUSH A SHARP ROD

06:25.052 --> 06:28.021
INTO THE NOSE
AND PULL OUT THE BRAINS.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.557
IT'S CALLED PITHING.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.058
- THE FROG IN THAT PICTURE
IS STILL ALIVE.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.193
- I TOLD HIM WE COULD GET
A DEAD ONE FROM THE PET STORE,

06:33.226 --> 06:34.795
BUT HE SAID,
"WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT?"

06:34.828 --> 06:36.497
- THAT'S MESSED UP.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.799
- YEAH, IT'S ALSO AN INDICATOR
IN THE TRIAD OF SOCIOPATHY.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.133
ANIMAL CRUELTY.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.603
- JAKE, WHY DIDN'T
YOU STOP HIM?

06:42.636 --> 06:43.937
- I TRIED.
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME,

06:43.971 --> 06:46.707
HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT
TO OUR CAT.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.809
- HE WOULD NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

06:48.842 --> 06:52.680
THAT OTHER BOY, JAKE, HE
MUST HAVE GOADED HIM INTO IT.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.982
- DO YOU KNOW IF HUNTER
IS SEXUALLY ACTIVE?

06:55.015 --> 06:56.684
- OF COURSE NOT.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.118
HE'S 14.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.621
HE'S JUST A BABY.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.222
- HELLO, BREE.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.791
NICE OF YOU TO SHOW UP.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.793
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

07:05.826 --> 07:07.160
- WHOA!

07:07.194 --> 07:09.863
- NO, YOU TELL THEM THAT
I DIDN'T RAISE YOU THIS WAY!

07:09.897 --> 07:11.899
- ARE YOU IN THE HABIT
OF SMACKING YOUR CHILD AROUND?

07:11.932 --> 07:15.903
- NO, HER WEAPON OF CHOICE
IS A VERBAL TONGUE LASHING.

07:15.936 --> 07:16.904
- SIT DOWN.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.472
- WHEN I GOT OUT OF LINE,

07:18.506 --> 07:19.940
MY MOTHER BEAT ME
WITH A BELT.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.642
MAYBE I SHOULD
HAVE SPANKED HIM.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.777
- WELL, ACTUALLY, STUDIES
LINK CORPORAL PUNISHMENT

07:23.811 --> 07:27.481
TO INCREASED VIOLENCE
AND LOWERED IQs.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.816
- WELL, I GOT WHIPPED PLENTY,

07:28.849 --> 07:30.918
AND I'M A MARKETING EXECUTIVE.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.653
- SHE THINKS THIS
IS ALL ABOUT HER.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.888
- NO, IT IS ABOUT
YOUR FATHER

07:34.922 --> 07:37.491
ABANDONING US
WHEN YOU WERE A BABY.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.092
- MRS. MAZELON, YOUR SON
HAS BEEN VERY ANXIOUS

07:39.126 --> 07:40.628
TO TELL US HIS SIDE
OF THE STORY,

07:40.661 --> 07:42.029
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD
HEAR HIM OUT.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.565
- OKAY.
- GREAT, HAVE A SEAT.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.270
IF I COULD JUST GET YOU
TO INITIAL AFTER EACH LINE.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.273
HERE.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.809
YOUR SON HAS THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.011
AND ANYTHING HE SAYS CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST HIM

07:58.045 --> 07:59.613
IN A COURT OF LAW.

07:59.647 --> 08:00.814
- WELL, IT'S NOT GONNA
COME TO THAT, IS IT?

08:00.848 --> 08:01.815
- WELL, IF HE'S COOPERATIVE,

08:01.849 --> 08:04.084
WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THE D.A.
HEARS ABOUT IT.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.953
- THE D.A.?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.121
IF ANYONE'S GONNA PUNISH HIM,
IT'LL BE ME.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.691
- AND IF YOU CANNOT
AFFORD AN ATTORNEY,

08:10.724 --> 08:12.993
ONE WILL BE PROVIDED
FOR YOU.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.668
- NO.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.802
HUNTER, LET'S GO.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.970
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.304
- HOME,
TO DEAL WITH THIS MYSELF.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.973
- UH, YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.841
HUNTER HERE IS NOT.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.276
- WELL, I'M NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT HIM.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.278
- WHY, THAT'S SWEET OF YOU,
BREE.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.746
- SHUT UP!

08:32.780 --> 08:34.247
AND I TOLD YOU
NOT TO CALL ME THAT.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.583
I'M YOUR MOTHER.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.184
- MRS. MAZELON,
HUNTER IS NOT LEAVING.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.886
HE'S UNDER ARREST,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.721
- YOU'RE MAKING A MOUNTAIN
OUT OF A MOLE HILL.

08:40.754 --> 08:44.725
- EVERYTHING IN MY BACKPACK
WAS FOR A SCIENCE PROJECT.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.960
- I'M CALLING AN ATTORNEY.

08:46.994 --> 08:50.263
- HE CAN MEET HIM
AT ARRAIGNMENT.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.834
- I CAN'T CHARGE HIM
WITH A SEX CRIME.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.268
- HE BROKE INTO
ANNIE'S APARTMENT

08:55.302 --> 08:56.937
WITH A NINJA-GRADE
BUTTERFLY KNIFE,

08:56.970 --> 08:58.939
DUCT TAPE, AND PANTYHOSE.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.941
- I DON'T MAKE HIM
TO BE A CROSS-DRESSER.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.776
HE HOSE WAS FOR
A FACE MASK.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.045
- HE INTENDED TO RAPE
ANNIE MEYERS.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.614
- I KNOW IT AND YOU KNOW IT,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.949
BUT I CAN'T PRESENT
A THOUGHT CRIME TO THE JURY.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.984
- SO CHARGE HIM WITH
THE CRIMES WE DO HAVE HIM ON.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.353
MAKE ENROLLMENT IN
A SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT PROGRAM

09:13.386 --> 09:15.823
A CONDITION FOR ANY PLEA
YOU GIVE HIM.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.124
- IF IT EVEN COMES TO THAT.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.859
HE'S 14.
THIS IS HIS FIRST OFFENSE.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.160
- NO, IT ISN'T.
WE CHECKED WITH THE SCHOOL.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.863
TWO MONTHS AGO,
HE GRABBED A TEACHER'S BREASTS.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.897
- SHE WANTED HIM EXPELLED,

09:23.931 --> 09:25.866
BUT HIS MOTHER
MADE IT GO AWAY.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.167
- IS THE TEACHER WILLING
TO COME FORWARD?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.702
- WE TRIED. NO.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.303
- THERE WERE NO CONSEQUENCES
ON THAT ONE.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.907
YOU LET HIM SKATE ON THIS,
WE WILL HAVE FUTURE VICTIMS.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.375
- GUYS, I WON'T EVEN
BE THE ONE TRYING THIS.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.711
HE'S A MINOR.
IT'S FAMILY COURT.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.947
- FIRST-DEGREE BURGLARY
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON,

09:39.980 --> 09:41.915
THE CUT-OFF IS 14.

09:41.949 --> 09:45.653
YOU CAN CHARGE HIM
AS AN ADULT.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.957
- DOCKET ENDING 0589.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.325
THE CHARGES ARE BURGLARY ONE,

09:52.359 --> 09:54.061
CRIMINAL TRESPASS TWO,

09:54.094 --> 09:56.163
CRIMINAL POSSESSION
OF A WEAPON FOUR,

09:56.196 --> 09:58.031
POSSESSION OF BURGLAR'S TOOLS.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.801
- ALSO POSSESSION OF ALCOHOL
BY A PERSON UNDER 21.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.936
- WELL UNDER 21, I SEE.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.973
- THE PEOPLE ARE CLEARLY ABUSING
THEIR DISCRETION, YOUR HONOR.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.041
IT'S A TRAVESTY THIS CASE
HASN'T BEEN PETITIONED

10:08.075 --> 10:09.677
OVER TO FAMILY COURT.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.811
- THE FELONY COUNT
MAKES SUPREME COURT

10:10.844 --> 10:13.246
THE PROPER VENUE FOR AN
ALLOCATION OF YOUTHFUL OFFENDER.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.183
- LET'S MOVE THIS ALONG WHILE
WE'RE ALL RELATIVELY YOUNG.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.184
HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

10:17.217 --> 10:19.086
- NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.855
NOBODY'S EVEN LET ME TELL
MY SIDE OF THE STORY YET.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.957
- AS YOUR ATTORNEY
CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU,

10:23.991 --> 10:26.794
YOU'LL BE AFFORDED
THAT OPPORTUNITY AT TRIAL.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.061
THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR?

10:28.095 --> 10:29.997
- DETENTION TO
A JUVENILE FACILITY.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.865
- THIS CHILD IS HARDLY
A FLIGHT RISK.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.234
HIS MOTHER'S IN COURT AND WILL
SEE TO IT THAT HE COMPLIES.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.704
- HE HAS A TOTAL LACK
OF RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.106
HE STRUGGLES WITH IMPULSE
CONTROL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.808
- SPURIOUS ALLEGATIONS
THAT HAVE NO BEARING

10:40.841 --> 10:43.010
ON WHETHER
HE'LL RETURN TO COURT.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.846
- BAIL IS SET AT $5,000,
CASH OR BOND.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.981
- IN THAT CASE, I ASK
THAT AN ORDER OF PROTECTION

10:48.015 --> 10:49.349
BE GRANTED
TO THE COMPLAINANT,

10:49.382 --> 10:50.684
ANNIE MEYERS,

10:50.718 --> 10:52.219
BARRING ANY CONTACT
BY THE DEFENDANT.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.687
- SO GRANTED.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.322
- I'M THE ONE WHO NEEDS
A PROTECTION ORDER.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.726
I WAS MOLESTED.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.193
- BY WHOM?

11:00.227 --> 11:03.864
- THE CREEPY GUY AT
THE PRECINCT WHERE THEY TOOK ME.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.999
DETECTIVE STABLER.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.479
- HUNTER ACCUSED ELLIOT
OF WHAT?

11:19.512 --> 11:22.950
IN OPEN COURT?

11:22.983 --> 11:25.753
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME
AFTER ARRAIGNMENT?

11:25.786 --> 11:29.222
OKAY, YEAH.
THANKS FOR THE HEADS-UP.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.959
- HEY, I'M GONNA NEED
TO TAKE AN HOUR LUNCH

11:31.992 --> 11:34.795
TO MEET WITH THE PRESCHOOL
FOR ELI.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.430
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT,
PRESCHOOL?

11:37.464 --> 11:39.967
WHAT'S UP?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.803
- UH, HUNTER MAZELON
PULLED A LITTLE STUNT

11:42.836 --> 11:45.505
IN FRONT OF JUDGE RIDENOUR
AT ARRAIGNMENT YESTERDAY.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.940
- YEAH, THAT DOESN'T
SURPRISE ME.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.976
- HE CLAIMED
THAT YOU MOLESTED HIM.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.315
- WHAT'D RIDENOUR DO?

11:55.348 --> 11:56.784
- NOTHING.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.786
HE SET A LOW BAIL,
WHICH BREE POSTED.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.353
- SO THE LITTLE PSYCHOPATH
IS FREE.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.022
- ELLIOT, DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.824
LET ME JUST TALK TO THE MOM.
- DON'T.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.759
IT'S NOT YOUR CAREER
HE'S SCREWING WITH.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.327
- HE'S A MESSED-UP KID
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.797
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
A DESPERATE HAIL MARY.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.964
- NO, IT WASN'T.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.199
HE WAS PLANNING THIS
FROM THE BEGINNING.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.500
THAT LITTLE RUNT
SET ME UP.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.567
- WHEN? I WAS WITH YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.469
- WHEN WE WERE WAITING
FOR HIS MOTHER TO SHOW UP,

12:16.503 --> 12:17.805
I BROUGHT HIM DOWN
TO THE YOUTH OFFICE.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.139
ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS KID
STARTS HOWLING

12:19.172 --> 12:20.440
THAT I'M GRABBING
HIS PACKAGE.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.009
- DID YOU WRITE IT UP?

12:22.042 --> 12:23.811
- HE LAUGHED IT OFF AS A JOKE.

12:23.844 --> 12:24.912
I FORGOT ABOUT IT.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.313
- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
GONNA WORK OUT.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.447
YOU'RE INNOCENT.
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.182
AS SOON AS YOU'RE SMEARED
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

12:29.216 --> 12:30.517
THE STINK DOESN'T GO AWAY.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.451
- ELLIOT, YOU HAVE
TO GO THROUGH PROPERS.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.420
YOU CANNOT CONFRONT
THIS KID RIGHT NOW.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.855
- I'M NOT, OKAY?

12:34.888 --> 12:36.356
I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.491
I'M GONNA GO DOWN TO I.A.B.,
SET IT RIGHT WITH THEM

12:38.525 --> 12:42.129
BEFORE THOSE SONS OF BITCHES
TRY AND MAKE IT PUBLIC.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.466
SO HOW'D YOUR TWISTED LITTLE
FAIRY TALE PLAY WITH I.A.B.?

12:46.499 --> 12:48.468
- STAY AWAY FROM MY SON,
YOU PERVERT.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.170
- YOU KNOW HE MADE IT UP.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.572
- YOU KNOW, I SAW YOUR FILE
ON LIEUTENANT TUCKER'S DESK.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.807
IT WAS PRETTY THICK.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.309
HOW MANY OTHER GUYS HAVE YOU
BEEN A LITTLE TOO FRIENDLY WITH?

12:56.343 --> 12:58.946
- HAS YOUR SON EVER BEEN TAUGHT
HIS ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES?

12:58.979 --> 13:00.113
- HUNTER, LET'S GO.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.815
- NO, WHY DON'T WE STAY HERE

13:01.849 --> 13:03.150
AND LISTEN TO SOME
MORE PARENTING ADVICE

13:03.183 --> 13:04.918
FROM A CHILD MOLESTER.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.354
- YOU LET HIM LIE AND CHARM
HIS WAY OUT OF TROUBLE.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.421
YOU'RE NOT DOING HIM
ANY FAVORS.

13:08.455 --> 13:12.459
- LIEUTENANT TUCKER,
THIS GUY'S STALKING ME NOW.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.461
- I WAS ON MY WAY TO SEE YOU.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.096
- FUNNY,
I DIDN'T SEND FOR YOU.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.297
- WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.532
- WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO LEAVE,
BUT THAT MAN WON'T LET US.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.035
- STABLER, MY OFFICE.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.275
I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT STUPID ENOUGH

13:28.308 --> 13:30.110
TO INTIMIDATE A WITNESS
IN MY FRONT YARD.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.444
- AND I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT DIM ENOUGH

13:31.478 --> 13:33.713
TO BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT
LITTLE SOCIOPATH FED YOU.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.587
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO A LAWYER.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.590
- I WAIVE THAT RIGHT.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.926
IT'S A SETUP.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.895
IT'S RETALIATION.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.496
- WELL, THAT MIGHT
HOLD MORE WEIGHT, DETECTIVE,

13:49.529 --> 13:51.865
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
IN THIS HOT SEAT BEFORE.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.433
WHAT IS IT, I MEAN,
HOW MANY TIMES IS IT NOW?

13:53.466 --> 13:56.503
- OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.

13:56.536 --> 14:00.573
IT'S ABOUT MY TEMPER
AGAINST PEDOPHILES.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.376
- MAYBE YOU STAYED AT
THE DANCE TOO LONG, DETECTIVE.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.611
WHAT'S THE NIETZSCHE QUOTE?

14:04.644 --> 14:06.113
"THOSE WHO FIGHT MONSTERS,

14:06.146 --> 14:08.148
BE CAREFUL LEST YOU
BECOME A MONSTER."

14:08.181 --> 14:10.650
- I DON'T TOUCH CHILDREN.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.886
I PROTECT THEM.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.393
- HOW MANY PERPS HAVE SAID
THOSE EXACT SAME WORDS TO YOU?

14:22.595 --> 14:24.464
AT YOUR PRECINCT
SATURDAY LAST,

14:24.497 --> 14:25.598
DID YOU ESCORT HUNTER MAZELON

14:25.632 --> 14:28.135
INTO AN UNOCCUPIED
WINDOWLESS OFFICE?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.237
- FOLLOWING PROTOCOL.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.505
- SO YOU ADMIT YOU WERE
ALONE WITH THIS MINOR.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.142
HE WAS HANDCUFFED.
- HE WAS UNDER ARREST.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.443
- YOU WANTED HIM
TO KNOW THE TRAUMA

14:36.476 --> 14:37.644
HE PUT HIS VICTIM THROUGH.

14:37.677 --> 14:38.378
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.213
- YOU SHOVED HIM
AGAINST A WALL,

14:40.247 --> 14:42.415
MAKING MENTION
OF A CAVITY SEARCH.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.350
- NO, THAT WAS
HIS LAME JOKE.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.552
- YOU CAME UP BEHIND HIM.
- TO UNCUFF HIM.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.387
- YOU SLID YOUR HANDS
BETWEEN HIS LEGS.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.488
- YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING
TOO MUCH PORN.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.958
- HUNTER CRIED OUT FOR HELP,
HE ASKED YOU TO STOP,

14:50.991 --> 14:52.592
SAYING STOP TOUCHING
HIS JUNK.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.394
- HE WAS SETTING ME UP!

14:54.427 --> 14:56.129
- THEN WHY DIDN'T
YOU REPORT HIM FIRST?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.602
- BECAUSE IT WAS
AN ASININE PRANK

15:02.635 --> 15:04.171
BY A 14-YEAR-OLD PUNK

15:04.204 --> 15:05.505
THAT ONLY A MORON
WITH AN AXE TO GRIND

15:05.538 --> 15:07.107
WOULD EVER BELIEVE.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.380
THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.215
- I KNOW.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.050
THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE A WITNESS.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.624
- NELSON.
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:24.657 --> 15:26.259
- TELL YOUR PARTNER
I WAS NEVER LOOKING

15:26.293 --> 15:27.460
TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.595
- TRUST ME, WE KNOW HOW
THE RAT SQUAD WORKS.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.097
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?
- THE TRUTH.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.531
- THEN THEY KNOW
IT'S A BOGUS CLAIM.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.500
- LOOK, EVERY DRUG BUST
I EVER MADE

15:33.533 --> 15:36.403
CLAIMED I PLANTED THE EVIDENCE,
SO I FEEL THAT.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.704
- GOOD, SO YOU
EXPLAINED TO TUCKER

15:37.737 --> 15:39.306
THAT ELLIOT'S BEING SET UP.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.741
- ALL I COULD TELL HIM
WAS WHAT I HEARD

15:41.774 --> 15:43.743
AND WHAT I SAW.
I COULDN'T LIE.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.279
- WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU SAW?

15:46.313 --> 15:48.281
- YOUR PARTNER
BACKING UP OFF THE KID

15:48.315 --> 15:50.150
WHEN HE HEARD ME
COME BEHIND HIM.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.152
- YOU SAW THAT HE WAS JUST
UNCUFFING THE KID.

15:52.185 --> 15:55.188
- I COULDN'T SEE HIS HANDS
FROM MY ANGLE.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.190
- YOU LET THIS KID PLAY YOU.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.659
- ALL I KNOW IS AFTER
I TALKED TO I.A.B.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.029
I GOT STUCK ON
COP-IN-A-BOX DUTY,

16:02.062 --> 16:03.596
WHICH I'M LATE FOR NOW.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.167
I'M DONE TALKING.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.202
- I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
HARASSING OFFICER NELSON.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.470
- FOR WHAT,
BACKING THIS CON ARTIST?

16:10.503 --> 16:11.604
NAH, GIVE HIM
A COMMENDATION.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.241
- THE ONLY ONE GETTING HARASSED
AROUND HERE IS ELLIOT.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.375
- AND IT GOES
WITHOUT SAYING

16:15.408 --> 16:17.544
THAT YOU CAN'T GET NEAR
THIS KID AGAIN.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.645
- THAT'S WHY HE PULLED
THIS STUNT,

16:18.678 --> 16:19.679
SO I COULDN'T DO MY JOB,

16:19.712 --> 16:20.780
AND YOU'RE PLAYING
RIGHT INTO IT.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.782
- THE DEFENSE
WOULD HAVE A FIELD DAY

16:22.815 --> 16:25.352
WITH ANY NEW DIRT
YOU DUG UP ON HIM.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.454
- THEY'D CLAIM THAT YOU PLANTED
EVIDENCE FOR REVENGE.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.756
- AND AS FOR YOU,
LET MUNCH AND FIN KNOW

16:29.789 --> 16:32.792
THAT WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING
HAS TO BE 100% ABOVEBOARD.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.227
IT'S GONNA BE SCRUTINIZED.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.096
- SINCE WHEN
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

16:36.129 --> 16:38.465
- THIS KID TRIED
TO DIRTY UP ONE OF OUR OWN.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.732
WE KNOW WHAT
HIS TACTICS ARE,

16:39.766 --> 16:41.268
AND WE'VE GOT TO BE SMARTER.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.370
- SO NOW ANY SCUMBAG PERP
IN CUSTODY

16:43.403 --> 16:46.173
LOOKING TO CUT A DEAL
CAN YELL "BAD TOUCH"?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.742
- MY CLIENT WOULD BE AMENABLE
TO DROPPING HIS CASE

16:49.776 --> 16:52.245
IF YOU DROP YOURS.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.781
- BLACKMAIL.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:54.814 --> 16:56.149
- HIS WORDS, NOT MINE.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.650
HE'S A KID, SHERRI.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.220
THE FINER SHADINGS
OF THE LAW ESCAPE HIM.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.090
- I'LL BE SURE AND PASS THAT
ALONG TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.524
- IT'S HIS FIRST OFFENSE.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.658
- I WOULD LIKE
FOR IT TO BE HIS LAST.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.660
- WHAT, BY TAKING AWAY
HIS CHILDHOOD?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.329
LET'S DISCUSS A PLEA.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.563
- PASS.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.832
- WELL, THEN
YOU'D HAVE BEEN BETTER

17:12.865 --> 17:15.168
TRYING HIM IN FAMILY COURT.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.503
NO JURY THERE.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.171
- AND NO RECORD
AFTER HE GETS OUT.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.572
- SUPREME COURT
ONLY GIVES HIM A RECORD

17:19.606 --> 17:21.108
IF THE JURY CONVICTS.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.609
- YOU DO REALIZE HE'S GUILTY.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.278
- YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO GET A JURY TO CONVICT

17:25.312 --> 17:26.579
WHEN THERE'S NO VICTIM?

17:26.613 --> 17:28.515
- WE HAVE A VICTIM,
ANNIE MEYERS.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.717
- WHO ON CROSS-EXAMINATION
I WILL ASK

17:30.750 --> 17:32.519
IF HUNTER LAID A FINGER ON,

17:32.552 --> 17:34.621
AND UNLESS
SHE PERJURES HERSELF,

17:34.654 --> 17:36.223
HER ANSWER WILL BE NO.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.092
- I'M NOT LETTING
A FUTURE TED BUNDY SKATE.

17:39.126 --> 17:42.395
- FIRST OFFENSE, SHERRI.
14 YEARS OLD.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.665
HOW DO YOU THINK
THE JURY WILL FIND?

17:45.698 --> 17:48.335
WE WORK OUT A DEAL,
WE CAN AT LEAST STIPULATE

17:48.368 --> 17:50.670
THAT HE GETS SOME HELP.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.405
[phone rings]

17:55.242 --> 17:58.678
[ringing continues]

17:58.711 --> 18:00.347
IT'S THE PHONE.
- NO, NO, NO.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.515
- COME ON, ELLIOT.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.652
- COME ON.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.620
- OH, SURPRISE, SURPRISE,
IT'S YOUR OFFICE WIFE.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.556
HEY, LIV.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.857
I DON'T KNOW
IF ELLIOT TOLD YOU,

18:10.890 --> 18:12.825
BUT HE'S TAKING
A PERSONAL DAY TODAY.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.128
- YES, I AM.
- MM-HMM.

18:15.162 --> 18:19.132
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ELLIOT?

18:19.166 --> 18:20.800
DOES HE NEED
TO APPEAR IN COURT?

18:24.704 --> 18:25.805
HE DOESN'T?

18:25.838 --> 18:28.608
THAT'S GOOD.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.610
OKAY, I'LL GIVE HIM
THE MESSAGE.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.712
BYE, LIV.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.415
- WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

18:35.448 --> 18:37.884
- GOOD NEWS.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.686
LIV THINKS THAT YOU'RE
OFF THE HOOK

18:39.719 --> 18:41.588
ON A TRUMPED-UP
MOLESTATION CHARGE

18:41.621 --> 18:43.623
THAT YOU NEVER BOTHERED
TO TELL ME ABOUT.

18:43.656 --> 18:47.694
- SOME LOWLIFE KID
ANGLING FOR A DEAL.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.262
WHY'D IT GO AWAY?

18:49.296 --> 18:52.665
- I GUESS YOUR A.D.A.
HAS A SOFT SPOT FOR YOU.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.702
SHE'S LETTING HIM PLEAD OUT.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.412
- ARE YOU AWARE,
MR. MAZELON,

19:05.445 --> 19:08.781
THAT AN ADOLESCENT'S BRAIN
DOESN'T FINISH DEVELOPING

19:08.815 --> 19:10.683
UNTIL INTO HIS 20s?

19:10.717 --> 19:12.685
- NO, BUT THAT'S
COOL TO KNOW, YOUR HONOR.

19:12.719 --> 19:13.786
- YOUR LACK OF CHARACTER

19:13.820 --> 19:16.923
AND DEMONSTRABLY POOR
DECISION-MAKING CAPABILITIES

19:16.956 --> 19:19.959
NEED NOT BE LIFELONG
HANDICAPS.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.661
- ALSO GOOD TO KNOW.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.230
- AS A CONDITION
OF THE AGREEMENT,

19:23.263 --> 19:25.765
YOU HAVE TO ALLOCUTE
TO YOUR CRIMES.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.400
LET'S HEAR IT.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.704
- "ON FRIDAY, APRIL 29TH,

19:31.738 --> 19:34.641
I UNLAWFULLY ENTERED
THE HOME OF ANNIE MEYERS."

19:34.674 --> 19:36.876
I WAS TOTALLY WASTED, AND
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS DOING.

19:36.909 --> 19:40.313
- SKIP THE EDITORIALIZING,
MR. MAZELON.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.283
IF YOU CAN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOUR ACTIONS--

19:43.316 --> 19:44.484
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.319
- NOT THE TIME, ELLIOT.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.987
- DON'T LET HIM DO THIS.
CALL FOR A RECESS.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.656
- IS THERE A PROBLEM,
COUNSELOR?

19:49.689 --> 19:50.957
- WE NEED TO CALL A RECESS,
YOUR HONOR, PLEASE.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.626
- WE HAVE A RESTRAINING ORDER
AGAINST THAT MAN.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.361
- HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

19:54.394 --> 19:56.529
WITHIN 500 FEET
OF MY CLIENT.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.964
- I AM JUST TRYING TO PREVENT

19:57.997 --> 19:59.732
A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE
HERE, YOUR HONOR.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.301
- I WANT HIM ARRESTED.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.003
- I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU
DISRUPTING MY COURT, DETECTIVE.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.705
COURT OFFICER,

20:05.738 --> 20:07.440
PLEASE ESCORT HIM OUT.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.712
CONTINUE, MR. MAZELON.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.982
- I'M SORRY, HE MADE ME
FORGET WHERE I WAS.

20:16.015 --> 20:19.719
- NAKED IN MISS MEYERS BED.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.655
- LOOK, I'M NOT
MAKING ANY EXCUSES,

20:22.689 --> 20:25.592
BUT AT THAT POINT
I WAS SO WASTED

20:25.625 --> 20:27.894
I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT I WAS DOING.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.697
- NO REMORSE WHATSOEVER.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.765
LIED THROUGH HIS TEETH.
EVERYBODY JUST DRANK IT UP.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.467
ANOTHER WHEN YOU GOT A CHANCE.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.968
- NOT DEFENDING WEST,

20:36.002 --> 20:37.570
BUT WHAT IF SHE CUT THE DEAL
TO COVER YOUR--

20:37.604 --> 20:38.805
- THEN SHE'S AN IDIOT.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.541
- WE'VE BEEN BURNING THROUGH
A LOT OF A.D.A.S AROUND HERE.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.443
MAYBE SHE JUST
WANTED US TO LIKE HER.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.945
- AS BITCHING AS IT WOULD BE
TO HANG OUT WITH THE COOL KIDS,

20:45.978 --> 20:47.647
I DIDN'T DO IT FOR YOU.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.982
- SO WHAT'D HE END UP GETTING?

20:50.016 --> 20:51.584
- THREE YEARS.
- REALLY?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.520
[cell phone rings]
- SUSPENDED BUT ANY VIOLATION

20:53.553 --> 20:55.054
RESULTS IN
MANDATORY DETENTION.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.055
- SO NOTHING?

20:56.088 --> 20:57.424
- 50 HOURS COMMUNITY SERVICE,

20:57.457 --> 20:58.491
ALCOHOL TREATMENT CLASSES,

20:58.525 --> 21:00.827
AND ENROLLMENT IN
A SEX OFFENDER THERAPY PROGRAM.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.595
IF I HAD ROLLED
THE DICE AND LOST,

21:02.629 --> 21:04.664
HE WOULD BE OUT THERE
WITH NO SUPERVISION.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.866
- OKAY, I GOTTA ROLL.
MUNCH SAYS WE GOT A CASE.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.668
- I'LL DRIVE.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.538
- HE SAID YOU'D BETTER
STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.539
[police radio traffic]

21:12.572 --> 21:13.940
- WHAT HAPPENED?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.475
- I SEE YOU GOT MY MESSAGE.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.644
RAPE VICTIM,
MADELINE HARRIS, 50s,

21:17.677 --> 21:19.011
LOOKS LIKE A BUSINESSWOMAN.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.414
SKIRT HIKED UP,
THROAT SLIT.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.682
- ANY WITNESSES?

21:22.715 --> 21:24.384
- THE WINO HER KILLER
PLOWED INTO

21:24.417 --> 21:25.518
WHEN HE WAS HIGHTAILING
IT OUT OF THERE,

21:25.552 --> 21:26.653
HE SAID HE WAS DRESSED
ALL IN BLACK,

21:26.686 --> 21:27.587
REEKED OF WHISKEY,

21:27.620 --> 21:29.589
AND HAD PANTYHOSE
PULLED OVER HIS FACE.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.657
- IT'S HIM.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.624
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.660
- THE WITNESS
SAID HE WAS SLENDER, 5'10",

21:33.693 --> 21:35.595
DARK HAIR,
LOOKED LIKE A KID.

21:35.628 --> 21:36.796
- IT'S HUNTER MAZELON.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.598
HE'S PISSED OFF
AT THE CONDITIONS

21:38.631 --> 21:39.699
THEY PLACED HIM UNDER.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.568
- OR HE WAS CELEBRATING.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.714
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:54.747 --> 21:57.350
- YOU WERE NOTIFIED THE
RESTRAINING ORDER WAS VACATED?

21:57.384 --> 21:58.618
- RIGHT, FOR LACK OF MERIT.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.886
SO NOW A MOLESTER
CAN JUST COME INTO MY HOUSE

21:59.919 --> 22:01.788
AND HARASS MY SON
IN HIS OWN HOME.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.390
THAT'S JUST GREAT
FOR THE VICTIM.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.558
- ACTUALLY, I'M HERE TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO MR. SAWICKI.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.494
THIS IS HUNTER'S
PROBATION OFFICER.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.895
- WE'RE NOT MEETING
UNTIL NEXT WEDNESDAY, THOUGH.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.930
- I FIND SURPRISE VISITS
TO BE MORE ENLIGHTENING.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.533
- HE'S HERE TO CONFIRM
HUNTER'S COMPLIANCE.

22:13.566 --> 22:14.967
- HUNTER WAS GIVEN
A CURFEW OF 7:00.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.769
HE IS HOME, ISN'T HE?

22:16.803 --> 22:19.105
- YES, OF COURSE HE IS.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.808
GOD, AS IF HIS DAY
HASN'T BEEN HARD ENOUGH.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.710
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WAS
EARLIER THIS EVENING?

22:23.743 --> 22:25.578
- YES, RIGHT HERE.

22:25.612 --> 22:26.713
- HE HASN'T BEEN OUT AT ALL?

22:26.746 --> 22:27.647
- NO, HE HAD A HEADACHE,

22:27.680 --> 22:31.918
AND SO HE WENT HOME
RIGHT AFTER DINNER.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.987
HUNTER, THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
HERE TO SEE YOU.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.656
- YOU'RE SURE HE'S IN THERE?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.425
- POSITIVE.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.892
WAKE UP!

22:39.926 --> 22:41.461
- MAYBE HE CAN'T HEAR YOU
OVER THE MUSIC.

22:41.494 --> 22:42.895
- THIS ISN'T FUNNY!

22:42.929 --> 22:45.598
I SWEAR, HUNTER,
SO HELP ME,

22:45.632 --> 22:47.767
IF I HAVE TO KNOCK
THIS DOOR DOWN--

22:47.800 --> 22:50.403
[front door opens]

22:50.437 --> 22:53.072
[rattling]

22:57.777 --> 22:59.779
- WELL, WELL, WELL,
WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?

22:59.812 --> 23:01.514
- DETECTIVE STABLER,

23:01.548 --> 23:03.983
YOU JUST COULDN'T
STAY AWAY, COULD YOU?

23:04.016 --> 23:05.952
NOT THAT I'M NOT FLATTERED,

23:05.985 --> 23:08.921
BUT, DUDE, YOU REALLY
GOTTA GIVE THIS UP.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.056
- PUT THE KNIFE DOWN.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.858
- THIS?

23:11.891 --> 23:13.059
- DROP IT NOW.

23:13.092 --> 23:16.195
- UM, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.730
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

23:17.764 --> 23:19.732
- I LOCKED MYSELF
OUT OF MY BEDROOM.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.768
I USUALLY USE MY POCKET KNIFE
TO OPEN IT UP,

23:21.801 --> 23:23.135
BUT HE TOOK THAT
AWAY FROM ME,

23:23.169 --> 23:24.804
SO THIS SHOULD WORK.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.005
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY SON.

23:26.038 --> 23:29.576
- NOW WHEN AN OFFICER TELLS
YOU TO DROP A WEAPON, DO IT.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.078
- IT'S NOT A WEAPON, MAN.
GOD.

23:32.111 --> 23:34.647
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
SHOOT ME?

23:34.681 --> 23:35.882
- WHERE YOU BEEN, SON?

23:35.915 --> 23:38.084
- OUT.
GETTING SOME AIR.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.886
IS THAT A CRIME?

23:39.919 --> 23:42.188
- FOR YOU, YEAH, IT IS.
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.857
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT
AFTER SUNDOWN.

23:44.891 --> 23:48.194
- I WAS ON MY OWN ROOF
FOR, LIKE, TEN MINUTES.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.729
- REALLY?

23:49.762 --> 23:50.997
YOUR MOTHER HASN'T
SEEN YOU FOR HOURS.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.733
- YEAH, WELL,
I WAS IN MY ROOM ALL NIGHT.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.835
ALL SHE HAD TO DO
WAS KNOCK.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.873
DON'T SHOOT,
IT'S NOT A WEAPON.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.809
- HUNTER, YOUR PROBATION
OFFICER IS HERE

24:02.842 --> 24:04.143
TO CHECK IN ON YOU.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.746
- YEAH, WELL,
HE CAN CHECK AWAY.

24:06.779 --> 24:10.149
I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO HIDE.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.852
- CHEERY.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.855
- I LIKE IT.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.857
- THOSE CLOTHES YOU'RE
WEARING DON'T EVEN FIT YOU.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.026
- WELL, YOU
CERTAINLY KNOW HOW

24:20.059 --> 24:22.161
TO MAKE A GUY
FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.263
- MRS. MAZELON,
ARE THOSE THE SAME CLOTHES

24:24.296 --> 24:25.998
HE WAS WEARING
THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM?

24:26.032 --> 24:28.801
- I DIDN'T SEE WHAT
HE CHANGED INTO AFTER COURT.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.036
- ARE THEY EVEN HIS?

24:30.069 --> 24:32.839
- YES, THEY'RE HIS.
- RIGHT.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.541
AND I SUPPOSE HE DOESN'T
APPEAR INTOXICATED

24:34.574 --> 24:35.808
TO YOU, EITHER.

24:35.842 --> 24:36.809
- [scoffs]

24:36.843 --> 24:39.211
I AM SOBER AS A JUDGE.

24:39.245 --> 24:43.049
- YOU KNOW SOBRIETY IS
A CONDITION OF HIS PROBATION?

24:43.082 --> 24:44.784
- I WANT YOU TO BLOW
IN THIS THING, PLEASE.

24:44.817 --> 24:45.785
- [chuckles] UM.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.054
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA LET THEM
DO THIS TO ME?

24:48.087 --> 24:50.489
- IT'LL BE FINE.
YOU WEREN'T DRINKING.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.996
- [blows]

24:57.029 --> 25:01.167
I HAD COUGH SYRUP EARLIER.
JUST SAYING.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.535
- MM-HMM.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.036
IT WOULDN'T GIVE YOU A .09.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.773
- WELL, NO LYING
YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS ONE.

25:06.806 --> 25:07.907
YOU JUST VIOLATED
YOUR PROBATION.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.108
- WHY ARE YOU
SO OBSESSED WITH HIM?

25:09.141 --> 25:10.810
- WHAT IS THIS
REALLY ABOUT?

25:10.843 --> 25:12.779
- PLACE HIM UNDER ARREST.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.114
- NO, I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW BAD HIS PROBLEM WAS,

25:15.147 --> 25:16.683
AND I AM GETTING HIM HELP.

25:16.716 --> 25:19.686
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T REALLY
TAKE HIM IN, CAN YOU?

25:19.719 --> 25:22.154
- WHY DIDN'T PROBATION
HAUL HIS ASS IN LAST NIGHT?

25:22.188 --> 25:24.557
- WELL, IF THE KID WAS
ON PAROLE, HE COULD HAVE.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.192
PROBATION HAS
A HIGHER STANDARD.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.728
CAN'T MAKE A SUMMARY ARREST.
THE HEARING'S FRIDAY.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.797
- YEAH, BY WHICH TIME
HIS VICTIM WILL BE THE SPECIAL

25:30.830 --> 25:32.565
ON THE WORM BUFFET.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.801
- HUSBAND'S DESTROYED.
WORKED WITH ME FOR OVER AN HOUR.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.936
NO CONNECTION TO HUNTER.
- PROBABLY ISN'T ONE.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.839
HIS INTENDED VICTIM, ANNIE,
WAS A CRIME OF OPPORTUNITY.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.841
- KID GOT LOADED
AFTER HE GOT OUT OF COURT.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.744
IT WAS MADELINE'S BUM LUCK
OF PASSING HIM IN THAT ALLEY.

25:44.777 --> 25:45.912
- WELL, HE DITCHED
THE MURDER WEAPON

25:45.945 --> 25:47.647
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
THE SCENE AND HOME.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.848
MOM'S COVERING FOR HIM,

25:48.881 --> 25:50.883
BUT SOMEONE GAVE HIM A CHANGE
OF CLOTHES ALONG THE WAY.

25:50.917 --> 25:51.951
- OR HE STOPPED BY
A LAUNDROMAT

25:51.984 --> 25:53.953
AND PULLED SOMEBODY'S CLOTHES
OUT OF THE DRYER.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.154
KID'S SMART.

25:55.187 --> 25:56.856
- HE DIDN'T GET THAT
FROM HIS MOM.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.658
IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN GET
HER TO COOPERATE?

25:58.691 --> 25:59.826
- WITH THE BLINDERS
SHE'S WEARING,

25:59.859 --> 26:02.194
NOT WITHOUT
STRONGER EVIDENCE.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.232
- YOU DO AN AUTOPSY
ON MADELINE HARRIS?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.767
- JUST FINISHED.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.168
- WE WERE HOPING YOU FOUND
A SMOKING GUN.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.871
- OFFICIAL CAUSE OF DEATH
IS ASPHYXIATION.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.172
- SURE SHE DIDN'T BLEED OUT

26:13.205 --> 26:15.842
FROM THIS BIG, GAPING SLIT
ACROSS HER THROAT?

26:15.875 --> 26:17.910
- YOUR PERPETRATOR
DIDN'T GO DEEP ENOUGH

26:17.944 --> 26:19.245
FOR THE JUGULAR OR CAROTID.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.847
HE SEVERED THE TRACHEA

26:20.880 --> 26:23.315
AND NICKED THE INFERIOR
THYROID ARTERY,

26:23.349 --> 26:26.686
WHICH BLED DOWN HER WINDPIPE
INTO HER LUNG.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.354
- SHE CHOKED TO DEATH
ON HER OWN BLOOD.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.122
HE HAD HER UP
AGAINST THE DUMPSTER

26:30.156 --> 26:31.357
RAPING HER FROM BEHIND

26:31.390 --> 26:32.992
WITH A STRAIGHTEDGE
TO HER THROAT.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.361
SHE PROBABLY STRUGGLED,

26:35.394 --> 26:37.797
CAUSING THESE GRAZING CUTS.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.065
RAPIST PRESSES
THE KNIFE TIGHTER,

26:39.098 --> 26:41.067
ACCIDENTALLY CUTTING INTO
THE TRACHEA.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.169
- ACCIDENTALLY MY ASS.
THIS IS A HOMICIDE.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.772
- AND LUCKILY FOR US,
A RAPE.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.874
HE DIDN'T WEAR A CONDOM.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.842
I'M RUNNING THE DNA NOW.

26:49.876 --> 26:52.712
- IF WE ONLY HAD SOMETHING
TO COMPARE IT TO.

26:52.745 --> 26:53.946
HUNTER'S PLEA DEAL

26:53.980 --> 26:56.148
DIDN'T INCLUDE
A SAMPLE FOR THE DATABASE.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.918
- PROBABLY LEFT IT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.787
- HE NIGHTIE HE WAS CLUTCHING
TO HIS JOHNSON?

27:00.820 --> 27:01.721
YEAH, I THREW THAT AWAY

27:01.754 --> 27:03.289
THE NIGHT I FOUND HIM
IN MY BED WITH IT.

27:03.322 --> 27:06.258
- SO, MISS MEYERS, THIS
CLOSET IS WHERE YOU FOUND

27:06.292 --> 27:08.928
THE BACKPACK
AND THE WHISKEY?

27:08.961 --> 27:09.996
- YEAH.

27:15.735 --> 27:16.836
EW.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.905
WHAT WAS HE DOING IN THERE?

27:18.938 --> 27:22.208
- THE LEGAL TERM
IS HANGING HIMSELF.

27:22.241 --> 27:25.144
- YOU LET ME KNOW THE SECOND
THEY CONFIRM IT'S HUNTER'S DNA.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.913
- PROBABLY WON'T BE
TILL TOMORROW.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.014
WHERE ARE YOU?

27:28.047 --> 27:30.717
- I'M JUST MAKING SURE
THE BODY COUNT STAYS AT ONE.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.852
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO GO NEAR THE KID.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.120
- I DON'T INTEND TO.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.723
HE BEHAVES, I BEHAVE.

27:40.126 --> 27:43.462
I GOTTA GO.

27:43.495 --> 27:47.299
THAT'S NOT THE WAY HOME,
HUNTER.

27:57.309 --> 28:00.679
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:34.881 --> 28:36.282
HUNTER.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.785
- HEY, MAN,
THIS IS GETTING CREEPY.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.953
DO YOU WANT ME TO HAVE TO
RENEW THAT RESTRAINING ORDER?

28:40.987 --> 28:42.354
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GO
STRAIGHT HOME AFTER SCHOOL.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.389
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

28:43.422 --> 28:44.456
- I'M FOLLOWING
COURT ORDERS.

28:44.490 --> 28:47.126
- THE COURT ORDER YOU TO STALK
AND RAPE THE GIRL?

28:47.159 --> 28:48.795
- NO.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.898
THEY ORDERED ME TO DO THIS.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.833
TEEN A.A.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.903
HI, MY NAME IS HUNTER,
AND I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

28:56.936 --> 29:00.306
SO UNLESS YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO GET SOBER...

29:07.479 --> 29:10.082
- DO YOU NEED A REMEDIAL
ENGLISH COURSE, ELLIOT?

29:10.116 --> 29:12.885
HOW DO I MAKE
YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORDS

29:12.919 --> 29:14.887
"STAY AWAY
FROM HUNTER MAZELON"?

29:14.921 --> 29:16.355
- LOOK, I THOUGHT HE WAS
STALKING A NEW VICTIM.

29:16.388 --> 29:17.957
- WELL, THAT MIGHT
HAVE HELPED YOUR CASE,

29:17.990 --> 29:19.926
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
SO ASS-REAMINGLY WRONG.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.127
- HEY, GUYS, GUYS,

29:21.160 --> 29:22.962
I HATE TO INTERRUPT
YOUR LITTLE LOVE FEST,

29:22.995 --> 29:24.363
BUT THIS IS M.E. BIRCH.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.966
- YOU'VE GOT THE RESULTS?

29:26.999 --> 29:28.935
- WHILE I WAS WAITING
FOR THE SAMPLE FROM THE CLOSET,

29:28.968 --> 29:32.438
I RAN THE DNA I FOUND IN YOUR
MURDER VICTIM THROUGH CODIS.

29:32.471 --> 29:35.908
GOT A HIT ON FIVE
UNSOLVED RAPES IN OREGON.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.344
- WELL, THEN HUNTER COULDN'T
HAVE KILLED MADELINE HARRIS.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.546
- NO, NO,
IT WAS HUNTER ALL RIGHT.

29:40.579 --> 29:43.382
THE DNA FROM THE CLOSET
JUST CAME BACK.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.451
IT'S A DEFINITE MATCH
TO THE OTHERS.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.125
- HE'S A 14-YEAR-OLD
SERIAL RAPIST.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.299
- YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.901
IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE,
ONE WILL BE PROVIDED FOR YOU.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.135
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.237
- FYI, IT'S THE SAME
IN OREGON.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.006
- NOT THAT THEY'LL GET A CRACK
AT YOU ANY TIME SOON.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.474
- THAT'S GOOD,
I HATE OREGON.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.077
DAD FOUGHT HARD FOR SUMMER
CUSTODY JUST TO IGNORE ME.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.544
- THE FIVE WOMEN YOU RAPED
IN THE SUMMER

30:12.578 --> 30:13.846
SHOULD HAVE GOT
HIS ATTENTION.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.381
- HEY, SPEAKING OF FAMILY,

30:15.414 --> 30:17.316
DO YOU HAVE A SISTER
WHO TEACHES HERE?

30:17.349 --> 30:18.450
- NO. WHY?

30:18.484 --> 30:19.618
- 'CAUSE THERE'S
A CALCULUS TEACHER

30:19.651 --> 30:21.587
THAT LOOKS
A LOT LIKE YOU.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.422
MAYBE I'LL HAVE HER
NEXT YEAR.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.525
- NOT WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
WATCH YOUR HEAD.

30:26.558 --> 30:29.996
- DID HE JUST THREATEN
MY HYPOTHETICAL SISTER?

30:30.029 --> 30:32.131
- WHY ARE YOU HELL-BENT
ON DESTROYING MY SON?

30:32.164 --> 30:35.067
- MRS. MAZELON, HAVE YOU EVEN
HEARD A WORD THAT WE'VE SAID?

30:35.101 --> 30:36.602
- DO YOU KNOW
THAT HALF OF NYPD

30:36.635 --> 30:37.870
IS TEARING UP MY APARTMENT?

30:37.904 --> 30:39.906
- WELL, I TRUST THEY GAVE YOU
A COPY OF THE SEARCH WARRANT.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.908
- OH, GOD, THIS IS
ALL ABOUT THE COMPLAINT

30:41.941 --> 30:43.943
THAT WE FILED AGAINST HIM?

30:43.976 --> 30:45.444
I GIVE UP.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.546
WE'LL DROP IT.
JUST STOP THIS.

30:47.579 --> 30:52.284
- YOU REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
ANY OF THIS, DO YOU?

30:52.318 --> 30:55.121
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU NEED
TO SEE IT.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.488
LOOK HERE.

30:56.522 --> 30:59.125
THESE ARE THE WOMEN
THAT HUNTER ATTACKED

30:59.158 --> 31:02.228
WHEN HE WAS IN OREGON
LAST SUMMER.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.897
BELINDA YOLAND, 42.

31:04.931 --> 31:07.166
SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
IN AN ELEVATOR.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.135
TRINA RYDELL, 44.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.537
SHE WAS DRAGGED
OFF OF A HIKING TRAIL

31:11.570 --> 31:12.905
AND RAPED AT KNIFE-POINT.

31:12.939 --> 31:13.906
- NOT BY HUNTER.

31:13.940 --> 31:14.873
- TERESA CAUDILL

31:14.907 --> 31:17.043
WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
IN A PARKING GARAGE.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.177
SHE WAS 39.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.478
- NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO STICK

31:19.511 --> 31:20.913
EVERY CRIME
IN THE COUNTRY ON HIM?

31:20.947 --> 31:22.448
- AFTER HIS THIRD ATTACK,

31:22.481 --> 31:25.084
THE PORTLAND P.D.
PUT TOGETHER A COMPOSITE.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.653
DOES THAT LOOK FAMILIAR?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.057
- THAT DOESN'T LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE HIM.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.491
- WELL, HUNTER
THOUGHT IT DID.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.061
AND THAT'S WHY HE WORE HOSE
FROM THAT POINT FORWARD.

31:35.094 --> 31:39.131
- NILA STURM, SUSAN PERRY,
38 AND 50.

31:39.165 --> 31:41.467
MADELINE HARRIS WAS 56.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.135
- STOP IT.
IT WASN'T HUNTER.

31:43.169 --> 31:44.971
- IT WAS.
WE HAVE HIS DNA.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.173
HIS SPERM WAS IN
EACH ONE OF THOSE WOMEN.

31:47.206 --> 31:51.143
- 20% OF ALL SEXUAL ASSAULTS
ARE COMMITTED BY TEENAGERS.

31:51.177 --> 31:54.080
MOST OF THEIR VICTIMS
ARE PEOPLE THEIR OWN AGE

31:54.113 --> 31:55.347
OR YOUNGER.

31:55.381 --> 31:58.617
- NOW WHY IS HUNTER
SO FIXATED ON OLDER WOMEN?

31:58.650 --> 32:01.120
WAS IT BECAUSE HE WAS
MOLESTED BY ONE?

32:03.289 --> 32:06.292
- MAYBE A WOMAN
AROUND YOUR AGE.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.565
- YOU'RE SICK.

32:13.599 --> 32:17.136
I WOULD NEVER--

32:17.169 --> 32:19.972
I'LL TAKE A POLYGRAPH
RIGHT NOW.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.607
- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE
TO DEAL WITH HUNTER.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.009
- WELL, THEY SAID
THAT HE WOULD BE HERE.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.144
WHERE IS HE?

32:25.177 --> 32:26.312
- NO, DON'T EXPECT US
ANYTIME SOON.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.414
MIKASEN AND VITALIE HAD HIM
IN THE BACK OF THEIR CAR.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.049
WE'RE FOLLOWING THEM.

32:30.082 --> 32:33.152
NEXT THING YOU KNOW THE KID
COMES FLYING OUT THE WINDOW.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.586
- I CAN'T BREATHE.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.122
- YOU'RE LUCKY
TO BE ALIVE, IDIOT.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.990
- SAID HE WAS GONNA BE SICK,
NEEDED SOME FRESH AIR.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.691
- AND YOU OPENED THE WINDOW
FOR THIS CON ARTIST?

32:39.725 --> 32:40.859
- I ONLY LOWERED IT
A LITTLE BIT.

32:40.892 --> 32:43.162
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ENOUGH
FOR HIM TO SQUEEZE OUT OF.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.163
HE WAS CUFFED.

32:44.196 --> 32:45.998
I WAS DOING 20 MILES AN HOUR.

32:46.032 --> 32:47.333
- I'M RIDING ALONG.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.235
I DON'T CARE IF YOU BROKE
EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.270
I GOT EYES ON YOU.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.473
MEET US AT BELLEVUE.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.741
- THE MOM'S ON HER WAY HERE,

32:55.774 --> 32:58.177
UNLESS OF COURSE SHE STOPPED
TO FILE A LAWSUIT.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.545
- GOOD NEWS FOR
THE CITY COFFERS IS,

32:59.578 --> 33:01.113
THEY X-RAYED HIM,
NOTHING'S BROKEN.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.182
- WHERE'S HUNTER?

33:03.215 --> 33:04.650
I TOLD YOU NOT TO LET HIM
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.152
- THEY'RE GIVING HIM AN M.R.I.
TO MAKE SURE

33:06.185 --> 33:07.353
HIS BRAIN'S NOT BLEEDING.

33:07.386 --> 33:08.487
NO METAL'S ALLOWED IN THERE,

33:08.520 --> 33:10.089
SO I HAD TO GET OUT
WITH MY GUN.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.123
- SO HE'S UNCUFFED.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.758
- HE'S STILL UNABLE TO MOVE
ANY OF HIS LIMBS.

33:12.791 --> 33:13.825
THIS IS THE ONLY EXIT.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.794
- WE TOLD THE TECH
TO LOCK HIMSELF IN THE BOOTH,

33:15.827 --> 33:17.196
TO FLASH THE LIGHT
WHEN HE'S FINISHED

33:17.229 --> 33:18.464
OR IF HUNTER TRIES ANYTHING.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.067
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

33:24.103 --> 33:27.373
WHERE THE HELL'S THE TECH?

33:27.406 --> 33:29.275
- THE KID'S IN THE MACHINE
BUT IT'S STILL RUNNING.

33:29.308 --> 33:31.677
- DAMN IT,
GET A DOCTOR.

33:31.710 --> 33:32.678
LOCK DOWN THE HOSPITAL.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.780
HUNTER'S WEARING WHATEVER
THIS TECH HAD ON.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.282
- WE NEED A DOCTOR IN HERE NOW!

33:36.315 --> 33:38.817
- WHERE THE HELL DID HE GO?

33:38.850 --> 33:42.588
SON OF A BITCH.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.256
- WHERE IS HE?

33:44.290 --> 33:46.125
- WE NEED YOU TO TELL US.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.060
- I DON'T KNOW!

33:48.094 --> 33:49.528
- WHO DOES HE GO TO
WHEN HE'S IN TROUBLE?

33:49.561 --> 33:51.763
- ME.
CERTAINLY NOT HIS FATHER.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.599
[phone rings]

33:53.632 --> 33:54.733
- ALL RIGHT,
IF IT'S HIM,

33:54.766 --> 33:56.168
DON'T TIP HIM OFF
THAT WE'RE HERE.

33:56.202 --> 33:58.304
[ringing continues]

33:58.337 --> 33:59.805
- WHAT IF HE WON'T
STAY ON THE LINE?

33:59.838 --> 34:01.107
- THE TRACE IS COMPUTERIZED.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.208
JUST PICK IT UP
BEFORE YOU MISS HIM.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.510
- TRUST ME, YOU WANT US
TO BE THE ONES WHO FIND HIM.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.711
SPEAKER PHONE.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.213
[beep]

34:07.246 --> 34:08.480
- HELLO?

34:08.514 --> 34:10.649
- HEY, BREE, WHAT'S UP?

34:10.682 --> 34:12.618
- HUNTER.
HUNTER, WHERE ARE YOU?

34:12.651 --> 34:15.087
- ARE THE COPS THERE?

34:15.121 --> 34:16.688
- NO.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.824
JUST COME HOME.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.626
- YOU'RE SO DUMB.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.129
YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'RE WATCHING?

34:23.162 --> 34:25.764
- I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

34:25.797 --> 34:28.167
THEY TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE
IN AN ACCIDENT.

34:28.200 --> 34:31.503
- I'M FINE.
JUST A FEW BRUISES.

34:31.537 --> 34:35.807
I HAD THOSE IDIOTS
BELIEVING I WAS PARALYZED.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.143
- OH, HONEY,
YOU DON'T SOUND FINE.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.610
YOUR SPEECH IS SLURRED.

34:38.644 --> 34:41.180
- THAT'S BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
DRINKING, YOU DUMB COW.

34:41.213 --> 34:42.548
- HE'S DRUNK.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.184
- BREE, WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO?

34:45.217 --> 34:46.852
- TO YOU, BABY.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.720
JUST COME HOME.

34:48.754 --> 34:49.888
LET ME TAKE CARE OF YOU.

34:49.921 --> 34:53.892
- RIGHT, 'CAUSE YOU ALWAYS
TOOK SUCH GREAT CARE OF ME.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.595
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
HAVE DONE SOMETHING,

34:56.628 --> 34:59.665
AND NOW I HAVE
TO DO IT MYSELF.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.567
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HUNTER?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

35:01.600 --> 35:02.901
- BYE, BREE.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.137
THANKS FOR SELLING ME OUT.

35:05.171 --> 35:07.206
BYE, COPS.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.874
I HOPE IT'S YOU,
DETECTIVE STABLER.

35:08.907 --> 35:12.478
IF IT IS, I'M GONNA
DO YOUR JOB FOR YOU,

35:12.511 --> 35:14.446
YOU GIANT DOUCHE.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.747
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

35:15.781 --> 35:18.150
HUNTER, PLEASE,
DON'T HURT YOURSELF.

35:18.184 --> 35:19.151
[dial tone]

35:19.185 --> 35:21.820
HUNTER.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.190
- WHAT WAS HE TALKING ABOUT?

35:24.223 --> 35:26.558
WHAT WAS
HE TALKING ABOUT?

35:26.592 --> 35:28.694
- I DON'T KNOW.

35:28.727 --> 35:31.330
- CALLING FROM A CELL PHONE,
BUT IT HAD GPS.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.565
HE'S IN CHELSEA.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.601
- [sobbing]

35:41.307 --> 35:42.908
- ACCORDING TO THE GPS,
THAT'S HUNTER.

35:42.941 --> 35:47.413
- SPARE CHANGE?

35:47.446 --> 35:50.916
[coins rattle into cup]
- YOU GOT A PHONE ON YOU?

35:54.386 --> 35:57.223
- DID YOU TAKE THAT
OFF THIS KID?

35:57.256 --> 35:59.325
- NO, HE BORROWED IT
FROM ME.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.827
- HOW MANY CALLS
DID THE KID MAKE?

36:01.860 --> 36:03.195
- JUST ONE.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.396
CALLED SOMEBODY A DOUCHE.

36:04.430 --> 36:05.531
- DID YOU SEE WHERE HE WENT?

36:05.564 --> 36:06.732
- NO.

36:06.765 --> 36:09.368
BUT I GOT THE BETTER
PART OF THE DEAL.

36:09.401 --> 36:14.906
HE GAVE ME THIS
TO BORROW IT.

36:14.940 --> 36:15.907
- WE'RE COMING UP
ON 24 HOURS.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.443
ANYTHING?

36:17.476 --> 36:19.378
- WE CANVASSED THAT NEIGHBORHOOD
ALL NIGHT, NOTHING.

36:19.411 --> 36:20.912
- SOMEBODY HAD TO GIVE HIM
THE WHISKEY.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.781
- KNOWING HUNTER,
HE PROBABLY BOOSTED IT.

36:22.814 --> 36:26.285
- HE'S GONNA DO SOMETHING
DRASTIC IF HE HASN'T ALREADY.

36:26.318 --> 36:27.753
- A SITUATION THIS DESPERATE,

36:27.786 --> 36:29.688
ANY CHANCE HE'S SUICIDAL?

36:29.721 --> 36:32.758
- DON'T SAY THAT.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.893
- MRS. MAZELON,
WE ASKED YOU TO STAY AT HOME

36:34.926 --> 36:36.628
IN CASE HUNTER CALLED BACK.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.301
- DON'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO HIM.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.803
THIS ISN'T HIS FAULT.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.505
IT'S MINE.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.474
YOU WERE RIGHT.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.709
HE WAS MOLESTED.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.880
- WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.818
- ON THE PHONE HUNTER SAID
YOU SHOULD HAVE HELPED HIM,

36:59.851 --> 37:01.687
THAT YOU DIDN'T
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.790
- WELL, HE WAS ONLY SEVEN.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.493
AND IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO REALIZE
THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG

37:07.526 --> 37:10.729
AND THEN TO GET HIM
TO TELL ME ABOUT IT.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.764
AND I SHOULD
HAVE FILED CHARGES,

37:12.798 --> 37:16.302
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW.

37:16.335 --> 37:17.869
- WAS IT A FAMILY MEMBER,
HIS FATHER?

37:17.903 --> 37:19.905
- NO.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.744
IT WAS THE WOMAN
WHO BABYSAT HIM.

37:29.415 --> 37:31.983
OH, THE THINGS
THAT SHE DID TO HIM,

37:32.017 --> 37:35.887
THAT SHE MADE HIM
DO TO HER.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.924
I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.892
- AND HE NEVER GOT COUNSELING?

37:42.694 --> 37:45.397
- NO, I JUST WANTED HIM
TO FORGET ABOUT IT

37:45.431 --> 37:48.534
SO THAT HE COULD
BE NORMAL AGAIN.

37:48.567 --> 37:51.002
- HUNTER SAID HE WAS GONNA
DO MY JOB FOR ME.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.771
DOES HE KNOW WHERE
TO FIND THIS WOMAN?

37:52.804 --> 37:58.310
- HE USED TO SPEND A LOT
OF TIME AT HER APARTMENT.

37:58.344 --> 38:01.647
BUT THAT WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.916
HER NAME IS ELLEN HUFFNER.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.783
- HUNTER.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.955
- [groans]

38:49.160 --> 38:50.796
- SVU PORTABLE TO CENTRAL.

38:50.829 --> 38:54.766
I NEED A BUS AT
385 21ST STREET, APARTMENT 2-G.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.468
- RELAX, YOU'RE HURT.
- ONE DECEASED, ONE WOUNDED.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.103
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CARED.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.107
I'M NOT HURT, JUST HUNG OVER.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.775
- HE'S NOT SHOT?

39:03.809 --> 39:05.744
- BLOOD'S ALL HERS.

39:10.849 --> 39:11.983
- GET UP.

39:17.088 --> 39:20.859
- THE OTHER WOMEN I HURT,

39:20.892 --> 39:24.696
THAT WASN'T ME.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.633
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I KEPT DOING THOSE THINGS.

39:27.666 --> 39:30.001
- I DO.

39:36.107 --> 39:39.778
- I WANTED TO STOP.

39:39.811 --> 39:42.881
I THOUGHT
IF I CONFRONTED ELLEN

39:42.914 --> 39:47.152
AND MADE HER TELL ME WHY
SHE DID THOSE THINGS TO ME,

39:47.185 --> 39:51.890
I THOUGHT IT WOULD END.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.926
BUT SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.963
AT LEAST SHE'LL NEVER
DO IT TO ANYONE ELSE.

40:00.566 --> 40:03.869
NEITHER WILL I.

40:08.940 --> 40:13.445
I THINK I'M GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.

40:13.479 --> 40:17.182
I THINK I'M GONNA
BE OKAY NOW.

40:24.823 --> 40:27.993
