How can you have diarrhea

08:46.325 --> 08:48.851
Was "loss of life"
in that list?

08:48.928 --> 08:50.294
Just a side effect.

Now, who's getting the shot?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.899
Okay, but you may have to give
me the shot on my derriere.

Needles can't penetrate
my electroimpalpable limbs.

Needles? Yeah, good one.

Try huge spikes.

They're wonderful
and frightening,

replace all your blood.

You get your blood back
at the end of the summit,
