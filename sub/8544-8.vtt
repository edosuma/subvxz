25:14.643 --> 25:16.602
SUPPOSING WHAT YOU SAY
IS TRUE,

25:16.602 --> 25:18.691
THEN WE COULD HAVE HAD
THIS TALK ON THE PHONE.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.867
YEAH, BUT IF WE TALKED
ON THE PHONE,

25:20.867 --> 25:22.956
THEN YOU... YOU PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE COME TO MEET ME,

25:22.956 --> 25:24.348
WOULD YOU?

25:24.348 --> 25:26.307
AND I WAS TOLD
TO CALL YOU,

25:26.307 --> 25:29.005
TELL YOU THE GAME'S OVER,
AND ARRANGE A MEETING.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.659
WHY?

25:30.659 --> 25:31.878
WHY AM I HERE?

25:33.096 --> 25:34.794
[sighs]

25:34.794 --> 25:38.362
PLEASE... DON'T THINK
FOR A MOMENT

25:38.362 --> 25:40.626
THAT I AM HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

25:40.626 --> 25:44.368
THE ASSOCIATION DOESN'T LIKE
LOOSE ENDS.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.501
JUST HATES THEM.

25:46.501 --> 25:49.069
SO...

25:53.160 --> 25:54.814
GO ON, OSCAR.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.600
NO, NO. LISTEN. LISTEN.
LET'S--

25:58.600 --> 26:00.341
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
JUST... W-WAIT.

26:00.341 --> 26:04.519
NOW I AM TRULY SORRY, BUT IT IS
TOTALLY OUT OF MY HANDS.

26:04.519 --> 26:06.913
I ALWAYS LIKED YOU,
PATRICK.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.262
[cocks gun]

26:08.262 --> 26:10.612
NO. NO.
THIS IS NOT NECESSARY.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.396
WE DON'T--DON'T--[silenced gunshot]

26:14.747 --> 26:16.879
H-HEY...

26:21.101 --> 26:23.625
THANK YOU, OSCAR.

26:23.625 --> 26:26.585
YOU CAN WAIT OUTSIDE.
JUST, UH...

26:26.585 --> 26:28.325
MAKE SURE WE'RE LEFT
IN PEACE.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.030
[door opens]

26:37.030 --> 26:39.989
[exhales] HELLO, PATRICK.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.643
[door closes]

26:43.079 --> 26:44.254
HI.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.052
[police radio chatter]

26:59.052 --> 27:00.575
HEY![pounds head]

27:00.575 --> 27:02.708
HELLO?![pounding continues]

27:02.708 --> 27:04.231
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:04.231 --> 27:05.624
GRACE, WHAT ARE YOU--HEY!

27:05.624 --> 27:07.626
WHAT--PLEASE DON'T
DO THAT.[sighs]

27:07.626 --> 27:09.410
YOU'RE WORSE THAN CHO.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.933
THEY NEED TO TELL US
WHAT'S GOING ON.

27:10.933 --> 27:12.935
[Rigsby] THEY DON'T NEED
TO DO ANYTHING.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.155
AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING,
SO PLEASE JUST RELAX.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.200
[huffs] RELAX?
HOW CAN I RELAX?

27:17.200 --> 27:18.941
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK
YOU LIKE BEING HELPLESS.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.595
OKAY, FINE, I TAKE IT BACK.
DON'T RELAX.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.292
JUST BREAK THE WINDOW
WITH YOUR FOREHEAD

27:22.292 --> 27:23.642
AND WE'LL ALL JUMP OUT
AND MAKE A RUN FOR IT.[sighs]

27:23.642 --> 27:25.339
GUYS, LET'S TRY TO KEEP IT
TOGETHER, OKAY?

27:25.339 --> 27:27.558
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.648
[under breath] "SORRY."

27:31.911 --> 27:34.087
MULLINS,
YOU'RE FROM HERE, YES?

27:34.087 --> 27:35.436
YES, SIR. OVER TO
LINCOLN HEIGHTS.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.351
GET ME A MAP OF SACRAMENTO.YES, SIR.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.569
THERE'S ONE ON THE COMPUTER
IN THE CAR.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.136
PAPER MAP.

27:41.572 --> 27:44.271
PAPER... MAP.

27:44.271 --> 27:46.186
COME ON. LET'S GO.

27:48.188 --> 27:50.407
[lowered voice]
HEY, DO YOU HAVE A PAPER MAP?

27:50.407 --> 27:54.673
WELL, PATRICK, HERE WE ARE.

27:57.284 --> 28:00.287
POOR FELLA.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.332
SMART BUT DUMB.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.553
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM

28:05.553 --> 28:08.121
THAT I AM
THE BLAKE ASSOCIATION.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.818
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO KILL HIM?

28:11.428 --> 28:13.996
EVERYONE THINKS
HE'S RED JOHN, DON'T THEY?

28:13.996 --> 28:16.912
SO... IT WOULD SEEM
A FITTING END TO THE STORY

28:16.912 --> 28:19.785
IF YOU TWO WERE FOUND DEAD
TOGETHER.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.612
NO ONE WILL LOOK
ANY DEEPER.

28:21.612 --> 28:24.311
SO I'M SUPPOSED TO DIE,
AM I?

28:24.311 --> 28:26.835
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

28:26.835 --> 28:28.315
SEEMS KIND OF UNFAIR.

28:28.315 --> 28:30.709
[in Red John voice]
IT'S TOTALLY FAIR.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.319
THE GAME'S OVER,
AND I WON.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.147
IT'S NOT A GAME.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.757
[normal voice] THERE'S
A WINNER AND A LOSER.

28:35.757 --> 28:36.932
THAT'S A GAME.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.978
IT'S NOT A GAME
I ASKED TO PLAY.

28:38.978 --> 28:41.676
NO, BUT YOU PLAYED IT
VERY WELL NONETHELESS.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.939
YOU WERE FUN, CHALLENGING.
THANK YOU.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.596
[chuckles softly]

28:48.596 --> 28:51.512
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A LOT
OF QUESTIONS FOR ME, HUH?

28:51.512 --> 28:53.557
WE HAVE TIME, IF YOU WANT.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.864
I HAVE NO QUESTIONS.

28:55.864 --> 28:58.693
YOU'RE AN EVIL,
SEXUALLY PERVERTED SOCIOPATH

28:58.693 --> 29:01.217
WITH PATHETIC DELUSIONS
OF GRANDEUR.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.654
THE REST IS JUST DETAILS.

29:03.654 --> 29:08.355
"EVIL, SEXUALLY PERVERTED
SOCIOPATH"?

29:08.355 --> 29:12.098
WELL, I GUESS I HAVE TO
OWN THAT, BUT, UH...

29:12.098 --> 29:15.231
"DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR"?

29:15.231 --> 29:17.016
NO.

29:17.016 --> 29:19.322
I HAVE NO DELUSIONS.

29:20.497 --> 29:22.238
I BUILT A SECRET EMPIRE.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.675
I CONTROL THE LIVES
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

29:24.675 --> 29:26.677
MY WORD IS LIFE AND DEATH,

29:26.677 --> 29:28.201
AND NOBODY KNOWS WHO I AM.

29:28.201 --> 29:29.898
NOW IF THAT'S NOT GRANDEUR,

29:29.898 --> 29:31.552
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU CALL IT.

29:31.552 --> 29:34.860
I'D CALL IT THE RAVINGS
OF A SQUALID EGOMANIAC.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.515
YOU SEE?

29:38.515 --> 29:42.432
FOR NO REASON AT ALL, YOU...
YOU'RE RUDE AND CONTEMPTUOUS.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.219
THAT'S WHY YOUR WIFE
AND KID ARE DEAD.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.570
WHO ARE YOU TO BUTT IN HERE

29:49.570 --> 29:53.008
AND MAKE OBNOXIOUS
JUDGMENTS ABOUT ME?

29:54.357 --> 29:56.185
WHO ARE YOU?

29:56.185 --> 29:57.317
HMM?

29:57.317 --> 29:58.753
WHO ARE YOU?

30:00.320 --> 30:02.235
NOBODY.

30:02.235 --> 30:04.367
NOBODY.

30:04.367 --> 30:06.456
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.154
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.547
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

30:13.115 --> 30:15.378
HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM, PAT.

30:15.378 --> 30:18.599
YOU'RE A SMART MAN,
BUT YOU ARE ARROGANT.

30:18.599 --> 30:22.733
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE SOMEONE
SMARTER THAN YOU.

30:22.733 --> 30:24.170
WHICH IS WHY I'VE BEEN
AHEAD OF YOU

30:24.170 --> 30:25.562
AT EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY.

30:25.562 --> 30:28.130
YOU'RE HOLDING THE GUN.
YOU WANT TO BRAG?

30:28.130 --> 30:30.567
GO AHEAD.
I'M NOT GONNA STOP YOU.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.310
[exhales]

30:34.310 --> 30:36.182
YOU STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW I FOOLED YOU, DO YOU?

30:36.182 --> 30:39.359
HOW DID I SURVIVE
THAT BOMB?

30:40.534 --> 30:43.363
HOW DID I KNOW ALL THE NAMES
ON YOUR LIST?

30:43.363 --> 30:46.366
IS THIS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
MISSING? APPRECIATION?

30:46.366 --> 30:48.237
HMM?

30:48.237 --> 30:50.065
DO YOU WANT ME TO APPLAUD?

30:50.065 --> 30:52.938
YOU HAVE NO IDEA,
DO YOU?

30:52.938 --> 30:55.027
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT
THE LIST OF SUSPECTS.

30:55.027 --> 30:58.073
THAT WAS A GOOD TRICK.

30:58.073 --> 31:00.032
BUT THE BOMB GAG IS SIMPLE.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.685
THERE WERE TWO EXPLOSIONS.

31:01.685 --> 31:03.949
THE FIRST WAS A CONCUSSION BOMB,
KNOCKED EVERYONE OUT.

31:03.949 --> 31:07.561
THE SECOND, LETHAL BOMB
THAT KILLED HAFFNER AND STILES

31:07.561 --> 31:10.303
ONLY WENT OFF AFTER YOU
DRAGGED BERTRAM AND ME

31:10.303 --> 31:12.131
OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

31:12.131 --> 31:14.785
CORRECT.

31:14.785 --> 31:17.614
FAKING YOUR OWN DEATH
WAS EASY.

31:17.614 --> 31:19.790
BRETT PARTRIDGE WAS
BLAKE ASSOCIATION.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.836
HIS JOB GAVE HIM ACCESS

31:21.836 --> 31:24.491
TO THE PRIMARY
D.N.A. DATABASE.

31:24.491 --> 31:26.232
HE SWITCHED
YOUR D.N.A. RECORDS

31:26.232 --> 31:29.017
WITH A BODY
THAT YOU HAD ON ICE.

31:29.017 --> 31:31.019
A SURROGATE.

31:31.019 --> 31:32.673
AND YOU BROUGHT THE BODY
TO MY HOUSE

31:32.673 --> 31:34.153
IN THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR

31:34.153 --> 31:37.112
AND YOU PUT IT ALONGSIDE
STILES AND HAFFNER.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.506
VERY GOOD.

31:39.506 --> 31:42.552
YOUR HINDSIGHT IS 20/20.

31:46.426 --> 31:47.906
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

31:49.385 --> 31:51.126
SURE.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.007
BREAD CRUMBS?

32:02.007 --> 32:04.313
[cooing]AAH! AAH! AAH!

32:04.313 --> 32:06.011
[tape rips][grunts]

32:06.011 --> 32:07.664
[gunshot]

32:07.664 --> 32:09.753
[groaning][gun clatters]

32:09.753 --> 32:11.930
UHH!

32:14.323 --> 32:17.370
[breathing heavily]

32:17.370 --> 32:20.460
[wings flapping, cooing][gasping]

32:20.460 --> 32:22.984
[cooing continues]

32:22.984 --> 32:25.073
[continues gasping]

32:32.559 --> 32:34.953
BIRDS. [panting]

32:34.953 --> 32:36.302
VERY CLEVER.

32:36.302 --> 32:39.218
THE BOMB WAS A MISTAKE.

32:39.218 --> 32:42.003
IT WAS THEATER.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.049
I KNEW THAT WHATEVER
THE TRUTH LOOKED LIKE,

32:44.049 --> 32:47.356
THE OPPOSITE MUST BE TRUE.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.447
PLEASE DON'T.

32:51.447 --> 32:52.753
DON'T KILL ME.

32:52.753 --> 32:55.538
OH, NOW YOU WANT MERCY?

32:55.538 --> 32:57.236
AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE?

32:57.236 --> 32:59.760
[breathing unevenly]

32:59.760 --> 33:01.588
YOU'RE NOT LIKE ME.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.416
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

33:03.416 --> 33:04.765
IT'LL HAUNT YOU.

33:04.765 --> 33:08.073
OH, I'M NOT HESITATING.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.813
I'M JUST SAVORING THE MOMENT.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.820
YOU'RE RED JOHN.

33:18.953 --> 33:22.000
I HAVE TO SAY
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.396
[doors open and close]

33:27.396 --> 33:29.398
OH, MY GOD!

33:29.398 --> 33:31.922
HELP! PLEASE!
HE'S GONNA KILL ME!

33:31.922 --> 33:33.794
OH, MY GOD!

33:33.794 --> 33:35.970
I'M A POLICEMAN,
AND YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

33:35.970 --> 33:38.712
SIR, I'M SORRY, YOU DON'T
LOOK LIKE A POLICEMAN.

33:38.712 --> 33:42.150
YES, I AM. JUST DO AS I SAY
AND LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.979
PLEASE PUT DOWN THAT GUN.YOU NEED TO GO.

33:44.979 --> 33:48.417
WHATEVER'S HAPPENED HERE,
MORE VIOLENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.506
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.SIR, I DO UNDERSTAND.

33:50.506 --> 33:54.075
I KNOW HOW ANGRY YOU MUST--NO, YOU DON'T,
AND YOU HAVE TO GO NOW!

33:54.075 --> 33:56.730
SIR, IN ALL GOOD CONSCIENCE--
[grunts]

33:56.730 --> 33:59.733
[woman grunting]

34:01.952 --> 34:03.737
[grunts]

34:27.195 --> 34:28.849
ALL RIGHT,
SO HE STARTED OUT HERE,

34:28.849 --> 34:31.156
AND HE DUMPED THE CAR HERE
AT A MINI-MALL.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.896
SO WHERE WOULD YOU ARRANGE
A MEETING?

34:32.896 --> 34:35.029
SOMEPLACE WITH EASY ACCESS,
IN AND OUT,

34:35.029 --> 34:36.552
CLOSE TO THE HIGHWAY.

34:36.552 --> 34:40.121
BALLPARK.TOO MUCH SECURITY.
WHAT'S THAT?

34:40.121 --> 34:41.427
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS.

34:41.427 --> 34:43.211
NO, THAT, RIGHT THERE.

34:43.211 --> 34:46.606
THAT'S
THE ALEXANDRIA CEMETERY.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.173
WHERE WAS JANE'S WIFE
BURIED?

34:48.173 --> 34:50.653
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO--WHERE WAS SHE BURIED?

34:50.653 --> 34:52.394
ALEXANDRIA CEMETERY.

34:52.394 --> 34:54.004
THANKS.

34:54.004 --> 34:55.571
[Abbott] ALEXANDRIA CEMETERY.
LET'S GO!

35:17.941 --> 35:19.465
OH, MY GOD.

OH, NO. OH, MY GOD!

35:23.512 --> 35:27.168

35:27.168 --> 35:28.996

35:31.825 --> 35:32.913
WHICH WAY?

35:32.913 --> 35:35.568
[panting] OVER THERE.

35:49.538 --> 35:51.627
[groans]

36:05.032 --> 36:07.295
[grunting]

36:12.735 --> 36:15.695
[brakes squealing]

36:18.001 --> 36:20.134
"B" TEAM, CANVASS THIS SIDE.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.527
DENYER, YOU'RE WITH ME.
LET'S GO.

36:21.527 --> 36:23.659
LET'S GO NOW. COME ON.
LET'S SEE IF HE'S HERE.

36:25.879 --> 36:29.056

36:29.056 --> 36:31.101
[lock clatters]UHH!

36:32.886 --> 36:34.366
WHAT WAS THAT?

36:45.203 --> 36:47.117

36:58.651 --> 37:02.307
OH! WHAT'S GOING ON?

[phone clatters]

37:44.914 --> 37:46.786
[sighs]

37:46.786 --> 37:48.527
AH, HELL.

37:48.527 --> 37:51.965
