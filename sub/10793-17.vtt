WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:04.100
This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

00:04.998 --> 00:06.898
We are going to survive,

00:06.998 --> 00:09.398
we are going to make it home.

00:10.098 --> 00:13.096
I'm telling you, the ship
came here for a reason!

00:13.476 --> 00:17.079
This ship is powered
by the stars themselves.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.196
He and Young are bumping heads, yes.

00:19.482 --> 00:22.148
Not sure which
camp is the better choice.

00:22.149 --> 00:23.382
We just pretend nothing happened.

00:23.383 --> 00:26.319
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.687
For the sake of the crew.

00:27.688 --> 00:30.187
For the sake of the crew.

00:30.188 --> 00:31.288
Dad, no, wait!

00:31.289 --> 00:35.326
You know, the Icarus project is
something your father truly believed in.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.427
A son?

00:36.428 --> 00:37.862
What's his name?

00:37.863 --> 00:39.161
Matthew.

00:39.462 --> 00:42.864
The few times I was conscious,
they were probing my mind.

00:42.865 --> 00:45.634
It's something I'd rather
not think about, really.

00:45.635 --> 00:49.769
There a reason your radio's off?

00:51.205 --> 00:54.007
What, you couldn't find a broom closet?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:33.237 --> 01:34.571
What are you doing?

01:36.507 --> 01:38.973
I should go.

01:38.974 --> 01:41.509
What? Why?

01:43.111 --> 01:44.912
I can't be doing this.

01:47.481 --> 01:48.781
Right.

01:48.782 --> 01:51.684
You say that now that you're done.

01:53.687 --> 01:57.154
You knew what you were getting into.

01:57.155 --> 01:59.923
You know what? No. Screw that.

01:59.924 --> 02:03.758
I am not going to let you kick
me aside like you did before.

02:03.759 --> 02:05.827
Yeah, well, whatever.

02:08.865 --> 02:10.131
Move.

02:10.132 --> 02:13.066
Me or her. You can't have both.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.602
I never said I wanted both. Now, move.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.570
Me or her, Matt...

02:17.571 --> 02:20.104
Get out of my way.

02:53.958 --> 02:59.958
STARGATE UNIVERSE
1x16- Pain

03:16.694 --> 03:18.561
Oh, for...

03:20.395 --> 03:21.662
Start to Dr. Volker.

03:21.663 --> 03:23.431
Anybody in the control interface room?

03:28.135 --> 03:30.102
How about anybody at all?

03:37.274 --> 03:40.343
Hello?

03:40.344 --> 03:41.744
Anybody?

03:45.014 --> 03:46.448
You okay?

03:46.449 --> 03:50.152
Yeah, the door control doesn't work.

03:52.622 --> 03:53.987
No, you don't have to...

04:05.564 --> 04:07.598
Stupid ship.

04:36.253 --> 04:38.054
Where is everybody?

04:38.055 --> 04:39.622
I don't know.

04:39.623 --> 04:41.524
The room was empty when I got here.

04:41.525 --> 04:44.292
Can I help you with something?

04:44.293 --> 04:45.426
What are you doing?

04:45.427 --> 04:47.595
Nothing you need to worry about.

04:47.596 --> 04:51.532
I like to worry.

04:53.233 --> 04:56.001
I was just updating
some personnel files.

04:56.002 --> 04:57.703
In the gateroom.

04:59.406 --> 05:02.139
Colonel Young and Dr.
Rush know all about it,

05:02.140 --> 05:04.141
in case you'd like to talk to them.

05:04.142 --> 05:07.244
I'll do that.

05:15.151 --> 05:16.585
Greer...

05:16.586 --> 05:18.484
have you seen Matt?

05:20.588 --> 05:22.689
I have not.

05:28.327 --> 05:31.162
Lieutenant James, come in!

05:34.364 --> 05:35.531
Lieutenant James, this is Colonel Young.

05:35.532 --> 05:38.267
Please respond.

05:45.273 --> 05:46.740
Yes, sir.

05:46.741 --> 05:48.775
You're late with the
current ammunition count.

05:51.377 --> 05:55.247
Lieutenant, what are you doing?

05:58.451 --> 06:00.016
Nothing, sir.

06:00.017 --> 06:01.351
I'm fine.

06:01.352 --> 06:02.785
I am...

06:02.786 --> 06:07.624
I just lost track of time,
but I'm on my way now.

06:07.625 --> 06:09.223
James out.

06:13.695 --> 06:14.762
So I heard that Colonel Young's

06:14.763 --> 06:16.829
calling off the search for Franklin.

06:18.265 --> 06:19.231
It's not like anyone was
really lookin' for him.

06:19.232 --> 06:21.634
The man just vanished.

06:21.635 --> 06:23.102
Weird.

06:29.607 --> 06:30.741
Dunning...

06:30.742 --> 06:31.775
Come on.

06:44.785 --> 06:47.120
What the hell?

07:04.768 --> 07:05.868
Dr. Volker?

07:08.436 --> 07:09.536
You okay?

07:11.673 --> 07:15.774
Something weird's going on here.

07:17.476 --> 07:19.444
What is it?

07:25.783 --> 07:27.817
You look... tired.

07:27.818 --> 07:30.787
Maybe you should go lie down.

07:30.788 --> 07:32.355
Yeah.

07:32.356 --> 07:35.122
Maybe I will.

07:59.775 --> 08:00.842
Matthew?

08:12.553 --> 08:13.786
Nicholas.

08:13.787 --> 08:15.820
Hi.

08:16.855 --> 08:17.855
Something wrong?

08:17.856 --> 08:21.325
I need to talk to you,
about something that hap...

08:21.326 --> 08:22.326
Just the two I need to see.

08:22.327 --> 08:23.525
Colonel.

08:23.526 --> 08:25.294
Am I interrupting something?

08:27.163 --> 08:28.230
No.

08:28.231 --> 08:29.631
Good.

08:29.632 --> 08:32.399
I wasn't even in the gateroom today.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.833
He said it was empty?

08:33.835 --> 08:35.568
Only person in the room was Wray,

08:35.570 --> 08:38.938
working at one of the
consoles, updating the files.

08:38.940 --> 08:41.606
Said you told him that Rush
and I knew all about it.

08:41.607 --> 08:43.408
No, I don't know anything about this.

08:43.409 --> 08:46.644
And I don't know what to tell you,
Colonel, other than he's lying.

08:46.645 --> 08:48.380
He has no reason to lie.

08:49.913 --> 08:50.947
Please.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.448
Sergeant Greer has had it in for us

08:52.449 --> 08:54.584
since the first day we
came aboard this ship...

08:54.585 --> 08:58.319
Correction. Since the day the two
of you led a mutiny to take it over.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.854
I can understand his suspicion.

09:01.656 --> 09:03.657
I was not in the gateroom.

09:12.298 --> 09:13.432
Hey!

09:13.433 --> 09:14.765
Are you all right?

09:14.766 --> 09:16.933
You didn't pass anyone
in the corridor just now?

09:16.934 --> 09:18.402
No.

09:18.403 --> 09:20.504
Oh, my...

09:20.505 --> 09:22.272
Matt, what happened?

09:24.340 --> 09:26.408
We need help in the work-out room!

09:26.409 --> 09:29.511
Anyone from the military,
as many as possible! Now!

09:29.512 --> 09:30.512
Get it out!

09:30.513 --> 09:31.644
Oh, my God!

09:35.349 --> 09:37.717
Get it out! Get it out!

09:37.718 --> 09:39.817
He thinks a snake is
crawling under his skin.

09:39.818 --> 09:41.652
Get it out!

09:50.927 --> 09:52.328
A snake?

09:52.329 --> 09:54.430
He said it was crawling
around under his skin,

09:54.431 --> 09:55.731
but no one saw anything.

09:55.732 --> 09:57.799
He just... flipped out.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.834
I can't find anything
physically wrong with him

09:59.835 --> 10:02.069
other than the wounds that
he inflicted on himself.

10:02.070 --> 10:04.903
Have you noticed any unusual
behavior from him lately?

10:04.904 --> 10:07.271
No, he's been his normal self.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.443
As far as I can tell.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.210
All right, well, let's...

10:13.211 --> 10:15.946
let's keep him here,
close eye on him

10:15.947 --> 10:18.147
and let me know when
the sedatives wear off.

10:18.148 --> 10:19.248
I want to talk to him.

10:21.118 --> 10:22.683
No warning or anything?

10:22.684 --> 10:24.786
He just... just went nuts?

10:24.787 --> 10:25.687
Yeah.

10:25.688 --> 10:28.022
Some kind of nervous breakdown.

10:28.023 --> 10:30.089
It was pretty scary.

10:30.090 --> 10:31.857
Tearing gashes in your own arms?

10:31.858 --> 10:33.859
That's... that's intense.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.527
The stress of life on this ship?

10:35.528 --> 10:38.397
Day after day
of not knowing what's ahead?

10:38.398 --> 10:40.831
It's a wonder more
people aren't cracking up.

10:40.832 --> 10:43.433
I'm just glad he took it out on himself.

10:46.070 --> 10:50.705
And didn't start shooting people.

10:53.442 --> 10:55.475
Hey, you all right?

11:00.014 --> 11:01.547
Hello? Earth to Greer?

11:08.420 --> 11:10.154
I'm fine.

11:13.990 --> 11:16.959
I always figured he'd
be the first to snap.

11:29.137 --> 11:31.503
Sergeant Greer?

11:33.606 --> 11:36.141
If you want to accuse me
of something, come forward.

11:36.142 --> 11:38.775
No need for spying.

11:40.978 --> 11:42.712
Who you talking to?

11:45.783 --> 11:48.149
Apparently no one.

12:07.532 --> 12:09.666
No...

12:09.667 --> 12:10.934
No!

12:10.935 --> 12:12.801
Help!

12:12.802 --> 12:13.868
Someone help me, please!

12:13.869 --> 12:15.437
Get me out of here!

12:18.007 --> 12:19.007
Wait!

12:19.008 --> 12:20.039
Get me out of here!

12:41.157 --> 12:42.658
Well, where the hell is she?

12:42.659 --> 12:43.792
I don't know, sir.

12:43.793 --> 12:45.692
I tried to radio her.
She's not responding.

12:45.693 --> 12:47.661
Oh, for God's sake...

12:47.662 --> 12:49.162
Lieutenant James, come in!

12:51.866 --> 12:54.099
Lieutenant James, this is Colonel Young.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.502
Please respond.

12:57.503 --> 12:58.803
James!

13:04.508 --> 13:05.708
I'm so sorry.

13:42.605 --> 13:45.505
You can't be real.

13:47.441 --> 13:49.575
Why did you leave me?

13:58.216 --> 14:01.118
Lieutenant Scott.

14:06.456 --> 14:08.524
Yeah, Colonel, go ahead.

14:08.525 --> 14:11.525
I need you in the infirmary.

14:20.733 --> 14:22.000
You're alive?

14:22.001 --> 14:23.501
She thinks she killed you.

14:23.502 --> 14:24.769
How did you... you were in my room.

14:24.770 --> 14:25.870
You're hallucinating.

14:25.871 --> 14:27.036
Just like airman dunning.

14:27.037 --> 14:28.871
What the hell is going on here?

14:28.872 --> 14:30.072
We don't know yet.

14:30.073 --> 14:32.175
I can't find anything physically
wrong with either one of them.

14:32.176 --> 14:33.242
I'm seeing things too.

14:36.111 --> 14:38.012
Hallucinations.

14:38.013 --> 14:39.079
My son.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.981
I keep seeing him on the ship.

14:40.982 --> 14:42.049
I just...

14:42.050 --> 14:45.684
I just talked to him.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.519
Your away team.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.989
James and Dunning went off-world
with you to the last planet.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.622
Maybe they picked something up.

14:52.623 --> 14:54.824
We didn't ingest anything that...

14:54.825 --> 14:58.628
It could've been airborne,
any number of possibilities.

14:58.629 --> 14:59.996
Corporal Barnes was on
the away team as well.

14:59.997 --> 15:01.696
So was Dr. Volker.

15:02.932 --> 15:04.032
Help!

15:04.033 --> 15:05.800
Oh, please, somebody help me!

15:05.801 --> 15:07.235
Colonel, we got him.

15:11.572 --> 15:12.672
Nothing?

15:12.673 --> 15:14.140
No.

15:14.141 --> 15:15.942
No weird things out of
the corner of your eye?

15:15.943 --> 15:16.976
Disorientation?

15:16.977 --> 15:18.008
No.

15:18.009 --> 15:19.743
Feeling pretty much the way I always do.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.446
Hungry, tired,
but I'm not seeing things.

15:22.447 --> 15:25.749
Maybe she's immune to whatever
it is the others picked up.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.550
Maybe her symptoms are just
taking longer to show up.

15:28.551 --> 15:30.052
Thanks.

15:30.053 --> 15:31.687
But physically, they're okay?

15:31.688 --> 15:33.021
So far as I can tell, yeah.

15:33.022 --> 15:34.256
No, he's doing fine,

15:34.257 --> 15:36.156
but I'm going to quarantine
the entire away team.

15:36.157 --> 15:38.992
Hopefully isolate the
hallucinations until they pass.

15:38.993 --> 15:40.260
What if they don't pass?

15:40.261 --> 15:41.528
What if it gets worse?

15:41.529 --> 15:43.094
I'm sure whatever it
is, TJ'll figure it out.

15:43.095 --> 15:45.563
I mean, she's done
pretty damn good so far.

15:45.564 --> 15:47.865
Is there anything I can do?

15:47.866 --> 15:49.234
No. No, I'll pass the word.

15:49.235 --> 15:51.267
I'll let everyone know what's going on,

15:51.268 --> 15:52.835
but the situation's been contained,

15:52.836 --> 15:54.770
so there's no need for
anybody to get alarmed.

15:54.771 --> 15:55.805
As soon as I know anything...

15:55.806 --> 15:59.108
Colonel Young, come in!

15:59.109 --> 16:00.441
Yeah, TJ.

16:00.442 --> 16:01.775
Can you come to the infirmary?

16:01.776 --> 16:03.911
I just discovered something.

16:03.912 --> 16:04.979
You see?

16:04.980 --> 16:08.814
So, it's difficult to see, which is why
I missed it on my initial examination.

16:08.815 --> 16:10.716
You see right there?

16:10.717 --> 16:11.984
Yeah, it looks like a tick.

16:11.985 --> 16:13.885
Yeah, I just checked the others.

16:13.886 --> 16:17.587
They all have one, same
spot, top of the neck there.

16:17.588 --> 16:18.588
All except corporal Barnes.

16:18.589 --> 16:19.689
She's clear.

16:19.690 --> 16:22.626
Welcome to our new galaxy.

16:22.627 --> 16:25.960
So, the ticks are causing
the hallucinations?

16:25.961 --> 16:28.896
I don't know for sure, but I think so.

16:28.897 --> 16:30.198
Maybe they inject a venom,

16:30.199 --> 16:33.201
some sort of toxin that
affects the brain's chemistry.

16:33.202 --> 16:35.268
Okay, I want out.

16:35.269 --> 16:37.303
Please, just get me out of here.

16:37.304 --> 16:38.871
I want out of here, TJ.

16:38.872 --> 16:39.972
Okay, okay, just relax, okay?

16:49.681 --> 16:51.580
Can you remove it?

16:51.581 --> 16:53.682
They seem similar to earth ticks.

16:53.683 --> 16:56.685
I could try and remove it the same way.

16:56.686 --> 16:58.287
You up for going first?

17:05.925 --> 17:07.193
Okay.

17:25.106 --> 17:27.540
Lieutenant Scott?

17:27.541 --> 17:28.742
What happened?

17:28.743 --> 17:29.610
I don't know. He's crashing.

17:29.611 --> 17:31.645
Let's start CPR.

17:45.823 --> 17:47.290
He's breathing.

17:48.993 --> 17:50.091
He's back.

17:50.092 --> 17:51.559
All right.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.727
Did we get it?

17:52.728 --> 17:55.830
We remove it?

17:58.765 --> 18:01.067
It's dug itself in even deeper.

18:10.678 --> 18:11.946
His pulse is normal.

18:11.947 --> 18:13.682
BP's back in range.

18:14.981 --> 18:16.381
Listen...

18:17.182 --> 18:19.451
is removing them impossible?

18:19.452 --> 18:20.386
No.

18:20.387 --> 18:22.321
It's just that when I
tried to pull it off,

18:22.322 --> 18:23.753
it must have released more toxin.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.689
I just have to figure out another way.

18:25.690 --> 18:26.756
Get to it.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.188
Hello?

19:26.836 --> 19:29.004
Hello, sweetheart.

19:29.005 --> 19:30.939
It's all right.

19:30.940 --> 19:32.906
It's really me.

19:32.907 --> 19:33.907
No...

19:33.908 --> 19:34.941
no, you're...

19:34.942 --> 19:36.376
you're not real.

19:36.377 --> 19:37.778
Chloe...

19:37.779 --> 19:38.779
Oh, God!

19:38.780 --> 19:41.646
No, this isn't happening.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.183
Chloe.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.285
Look at me.

19:49.720 --> 19:53.390
Whether I'm real or not, aren't you...

19:53.391 --> 19:55.659
at least happy to see your old man?

20:01.564 --> 20:04.299
I have missed you, sweetheart.

20:10.704 --> 20:12.038
I've missed you so much.

20:27.951 --> 20:29.485
So, where do you want to put 'em?

20:29.486 --> 20:31.318
If we do this, then we could...

20:36.023 --> 20:37.190
Hey!

20:42.728 --> 20:44.195
What's going on here?

20:44.196 --> 20:45.263
What do you mean?

20:45.264 --> 20:46.598
We're just talking.

20:46.599 --> 20:48.397
About what?

20:48.398 --> 20:52.135
Is something bothering you, Sergeant?

20:52.136 --> 20:54.170
I don't know.

20:54.171 --> 20:55.238
Should there be?

20:55.239 --> 20:57.671
If you've got something to say,

20:57.672 --> 21:01.208
why don't you just go ahead and say it?

21:01.209 --> 21:02.977
You're not taking over this ship again.

21:05.311 --> 21:06.712
We've no intentions of doing so.

21:06.713 --> 21:08.380
You're being paranoid.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.250
I know you're up to something.

21:13.251 --> 21:15.252
And you have proof of this, do you?

21:20.024 --> 21:21.589
Of course you don't.

21:24.527 --> 21:25.593
Are we done here?

21:42.507 --> 21:44.275
We haven't had any luck yet

21:44.276 --> 21:47.543
figuring out a way home.

21:47.544 --> 21:49.111
God knows if we ever will.

21:51.381 --> 21:53.549
We do have the communication stones.

21:53.550 --> 21:57.184
I was able to use them to go see mom.

21:57.185 --> 21:58.251
How is she?

22:00.321 --> 22:02.322
Strong.

22:02.323 --> 22:05.757
Fragile.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.760
Doing her best, considering.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.061
She's a fighter.

22:10.062 --> 22:13.362
Like you.

22:15.532 --> 22:18.701
Sometimes I see you in my dreams.

22:19.770 --> 22:21.402
But they always end the same.

22:27.642 --> 22:29.812
I'm trying to get through this,

22:31.678 --> 22:33.812
but it just gets so...

22:33.813 --> 22:35.214
Hey.

22:35.215 --> 22:36.515
One step at a time.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.685
Look at that view.

22:41.686 --> 22:45.355
God, I've never seen anything like it.

22:45.356 --> 22:48.656
I always dreamed that you
would live a life of adventure.

22:48.657 --> 22:49.724
Travel the world.

22:49.725 --> 22:50.758
I know.

22:50.759 --> 22:53.728
You told me frequently.

22:53.729 --> 22:56.429
Well, look at you now.

22:56.430 --> 22:58.798
Sailing through the universe,

22:58.799 --> 23:02.366
exploring galaxies and planets.

23:06.705 --> 23:08.305
You're living my dream, kiddo.

23:14.244 --> 23:16.612
Hey, what do you got?

23:16.613 --> 23:19.379
The venom we extracted from
the jungle planet creature.

23:19.380 --> 23:21.581
It worked as an anesthetic
on Rush during his surgery.

23:21.582 --> 23:25.084
I think that if I apply
it topically to the tick...

23:25.085 --> 23:27.520
Knock it out,
give you time to remove it.

23:27.521 --> 23:28.519
That's great.

23:29.855 --> 23:31.923
Oh, he's coming to.

23:31.924 --> 23:32.991
What happened?

23:32.992 --> 23:34.726
You got a jolt when we
tried to remove the tick.

23:34.727 --> 23:35.861
Relax, just relax.

23:37.795 --> 23:40.096
We're going to try to anesthetize it,

23:40.097 --> 23:42.532
and then I'll try and see if
I can remove it safely, okay?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.701
Okay, let's just take a look here.

23:55.975 --> 23:57.909
It's gone.

23:57.910 --> 23:59.878
The tick.

23:59.879 --> 24:00.946
It just died off?

24:00.947 --> 24:02.712
I don't know.

24:10.018 --> 24:11.652
Theirs are both still attached.

24:11.653 --> 24:13.087
Volker as well.

24:13.088 --> 24:14.555
Could it have jumped?

24:20.727 --> 24:22.695
Yeah, no, I remember.

24:24.931 --> 24:28.632
Gosh, that's so funny, I feel
like that was forever ago.

24:30.735 --> 24:31.902
Hey.

24:34.138 --> 24:37.505
What are you doing?

24:41.877 --> 24:42.944
What's wrong?

24:44.712 --> 24:46.079
Chloe?

24:46.080 --> 24:48.581
I'm fine.

24:48.582 --> 24:49.649
Really?

24:49.650 --> 24:51.751
'Cause you don't seem fine.

24:53.752 --> 24:55.019
My father's here.

24:56.188 --> 24:57.989
I mean, I...

24:57.990 --> 25:00.091
I know he's not... here.

25:00.092 --> 25:01.423
I'm just...

25:01.424 --> 25:02.558
Just...

25:02.559 --> 25:04.760
hallucinating?

25:07.063 --> 25:09.963
It's really strange.

25:09.964 --> 25:12.799
He's so...

25:12.800 --> 25:13.934
real.

25:13.935 --> 25:15.769
You're seeing him right now?

25:15.770 --> 25:16.770
- Yes.
- Where?

25:18.437 --> 25:21.172
Right beside me.

25:22.808 --> 25:24.643
Hello, Mr. Wallace.

25:24.644 --> 25:28.211
He can't hear you.

25:28.212 --> 25:32.582
Okay. Chloe...

25:32.583 --> 25:35.916
We've got to get you to the
infirmary, just have TJ take a look...

25:35.917 --> 25:36.851
No, I already know what's wrong.

25:36.852 --> 25:38.486
There's a tick on me.

25:38.487 --> 25:40.521
Matt and his team picked
them up on the last planet.

25:40.522 --> 25:42.590
One must have jumped to me somehow...

25:42.591 --> 25:44.056
Wait a minute, what?

25:44.057 --> 25:45.457
An alien tick?

25:45.458 --> 25:47.026
Are you kidding me?

25:47.027 --> 25:49.194
TJ thinks it might inject some kind of
toxin that causes people to hallucinate...

25:49.195 --> 25:50.029
Look, we have to go...

25:50.030 --> 25:51.628
- No! No, wait!
- Chloe...

25:51.629 --> 25:52.763
It doesn't hurt.

25:52.764 --> 25:54.197
That's not the point...

25:54.198 --> 25:55.465
And he's not hurting me either.

25:55.466 --> 25:56.466
He?

25:56.467 --> 25:58.669
You mean your imaginary father?

25:58.670 --> 26:00.201
I'm not crazy.

26:00.202 --> 26:01.870
I know what's going on.

26:01.871 --> 26:07.709
I know that
he's not real, but I can't...

26:10.844 --> 26:14.981
I'm not ready to lose him again, okay?

26:17.816 --> 26:19.884
You can't let that thing stay on you.

26:19.885 --> 26:21.952
I know, okay?

26:21.953 --> 26:23.487
I know.

26:23.488 --> 26:24.588
Just...

26:24.589 --> 26:26.622
humor me, all right?

26:26.623 --> 26:28.724
Give me some time?

26:28.725 --> 26:32.661
I'll go see TJ soon, I promise,

26:32.662 --> 26:34.027
but for now, just...

26:34.028 --> 26:37.764
Don't tell anyone, okay?

26:37.765 --> 26:41.001
Please, Eli.

26:54.945 --> 26:55.945
Okay, Sergeant, I've...

27:39.046 --> 27:42.012
I don't see anything. You're clear, too.

27:42.013 --> 27:43.214
What happened to it?

27:43.215 --> 27:45.516
Listen, I want you to go back to
your quarters, and stay there until...

27:45.517 --> 27:46.851
No.

27:46.852 --> 27:47.718
Just a precaution, make
sure nothing happens.

27:47.719 --> 27:49.186
Cole can take over for you.

27:49.187 --> 27:51.587
No, Colonel, please, I'm fine.

27:51.588 --> 27:53.622
Look, we'll check
ourselves periodically,

27:53.623 --> 27:56.992
and if I start having any
hallucinations, then...

27:58.027 --> 27:59.025
Chloe.

27:59.026 --> 28:01.228
She was in here earlier.

28:01.229 --> 28:03.830
I'll go find her.

28:55.930 --> 28:58.229
Ready?

29:17.879 --> 29:19.213
Okay?

29:27.820 --> 29:29.988
Colonel Young, come in!

29:32.256 --> 29:33.790
Colonel Young, do you read?

29:55.375 --> 29:57.141
Eli...

29:57.142 --> 29:58.375
Hey.

29:58.376 --> 29:59.443
Are you okay? I heard you...

29:59.444 --> 30:00.778
I'm fine.

30:00.779 --> 30:02.880
Have you seen Chloe?

30:05.248 --> 30:07.149
Eli?

30:08.251 --> 30:10.385
Yeah.

30:19.193 --> 30:20.326
Matt...

30:20.327 --> 30:22.360
Hey, I need you to come
with me to the infirmary.

30:22.361 --> 30:26.497
There's a chance that the tick
that was on me jumped to you.

30:26.498 --> 30:29.534
Have you been seeing any weird things?

30:29.535 --> 30:32.268
No. I'm fine...

30:32.269 --> 30:34.503
Chloe.

30:36.807 --> 30:38.140
She's seeing her dad.

30:38.141 --> 30:39.206
Eli!

30:39.207 --> 30:40.474
We need to get you to the infirmary.

30:40.475 --> 30:41.608
No, just wait a minute.

30:41.609 --> 30:42.710
I just need a little more time...

30:42.711 --> 30:44.311
We can't risk letting
that thing stay on you.

30:44.312 --> 30:46.146
Don't leave me, Chloe!

30:46.147 --> 30:47.979
No. Wait! I'm not...

30:47.980 --> 30:49.881
Come on, Chloe, Chloe? Come on!

30:49.882 --> 30:51.316
Come on. It'll be okay.

31:12.999 --> 31:18.537
Can I help you with something, Sergeant?

31:18.538 --> 31:21.605
You can start by wiping
that smile off your face.

31:21.606 --> 31:23.006
What smile?

31:24.542 --> 31:30.245
I'd appreciate you not telling
lies about me to Colonel Young.

31:32.348 --> 31:33.582
Lies.

31:33.583 --> 31:36.184
Telling him that I was in the
gateroom, messing with the consoles.

31:36.185 --> 31:39.486
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing, Sergeant, but...

31:44.925 --> 31:46.991
What are you doing?

31:46.992 --> 31:49.327
There it is.

31:49.328 --> 31:53.231
I don't know why you have to remove it.

31:53.232 --> 31:54.665
It's not hurting me.

31:54.666 --> 31:55.998
You don't know that.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.000
It's making you hallucinate.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.269
Who knows what else it's doing.

31:59.270 --> 32:00.704
It's too dangerous to leave in place.

32:00.705 --> 32:03.038
Guys,
this discussion needs to end now.

32:03.039 --> 32:05.205
Let's remove it.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.410
Tell your mother that I love her.

32:10.611 --> 32:12.577
I miss her.

32:13.946 --> 32:15.613
I love you, daddy.

32:18.117 --> 32:20.149
I love you, too, sweetheart.

32:20.150 --> 32:22.185
You're living our dream.

32:22.186 --> 32:23.219
Remember that.

32:48.773 --> 32:50.440
Colonel Young, come in!

32:52.110 --> 32:53.510
Go ahead, Sergeant.

32:53.511 --> 32:55.810
Colonel Young, we have a problem.

32:55.811 --> 32:58.246
The civilians are trying
to take over the ship again.

32:58.247 --> 32:59.514
What?

32:59.515 --> 33:00.815
I'm pursuing Rush.

33:00.816 --> 33:04.284
He and Wray are actively trying
to seize control of the ship.

33:04.285 --> 33:06.386
Now, I don't know who else
is working with them, sir,

33:06.387 --> 33:09.222
but we need to mobilize now.

33:09.223 --> 33:10.723
Sergeant, I need you to listen to me.

33:10.724 --> 33:11.756
Do not do anything.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.057
I will talk to them.

33:13.058 --> 33:14.392
Permission to use deadly force.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.459
What? No, did you hear what I said?

33:15.460 --> 33:16.560
I need you to stand down.

33:16.561 --> 33:18.296
Do not do anything.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.329
Permission granted.

33:20.330 --> 33:23.232
Use whatever force
necessary to stop them.

33:23.233 --> 33:24.300
Copy that.

33:24.301 --> 33:26.535
Sergeant, we don't know

33:26.536 --> 33:28.368
if these channels have been compromised.

33:28.369 --> 33:30.170
Go to radio silence.

33:30.171 --> 33:32.539
Yes, sir.

33:37.643 --> 33:42.080
Greer, acknowledge. I said stand down.

33:42.081 --> 33:44.115
You think he might be hallucinating too?

33:44.116 --> 33:45.348
How?

33:45.349 --> 33:46.249
All the ticks have been accounted for.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.318
Unless there was more than one tick

33:48.319 --> 33:49.652
on each of you when you guys got back.

33:51.255 --> 33:52.288
Go find Greer.

33:52.289 --> 33:53.554
Yes, sir.

33:53.555 --> 33:55.489
We need to
examine everyone on this ship.

33:55.490 --> 33:56.624
Quarantine anyone who's clear.

33:56.625 --> 33:58.426
Yes, sir.

34:03.463 --> 34:04.463
Sergeant Greer...

34:48.630 --> 34:51.766
I know you're in here, Rush.

34:54.936 --> 34:57.637
Show yourself!

35:43.839 --> 35:44.973
No!

35:45.274 --> 35:46.874
What are you doing?

35:46.875 --> 35:47.875
Open that door!

35:50.713 --> 35:53.146
You're not taking over the ship again.

35:54.570 --> 35:55.874
Colonel Young, come in!

35:55.875 --> 35:56.875
Go ahead, Scott.

35:56.876 --> 35:58.943
No sign of Greer.

35:58.944 --> 36:01.244
Still not responding to any radio calls.

36:01.245 --> 36:02.745
All right, well, keep at it.

36:02.746 --> 36:05.414
Sir, Rush and Wray are
also unaccounted for.

36:05.415 --> 36:06.883
No one knows where they are.

36:06.884 --> 36:08.983
Rush isn't responding
to his radio, either.

36:08.984 --> 36:11.151
All right.

36:11.152 --> 36:13.387
I'll put a few more details together.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.155
TJ...

36:15.156 --> 36:17.356
Excuse me.

36:17.357 --> 36:20.325
So, listen, I got to
go help look for Greer.

36:20.326 --> 36:21.793
You going to be okay?

36:21.794 --> 36:23.161
Yeah, fine.

36:23.162 --> 36:25.929
But if you feel any different,
see anything out of the usual...

36:25.930 --> 36:27.330
No, believe me,

36:27.331 --> 36:30.300
I'm as concerned about this as you are.

36:30.301 --> 36:32.102
Fine, fine. Keep me posted.

36:32.103 --> 36:33.103
Yeah.

36:33.104 --> 36:35.370
Thanks.

36:35.371 --> 36:37.272
More than one tick attached to you

36:37.273 --> 36:40.808
would explain why some of the
hallucinations were more...

36:40.809 --> 36:43.142
intense than others.

36:43.143 --> 36:46.012
The toxins, maybe they
target the limbic system.

36:47.381 --> 36:50.948
It's the area of the brain
that's responsible for emotion.

36:50.949 --> 36:53.984
So, fear, anger, remorse...

36:53.985 --> 36:56.420
Matt's guilt over his son.

36:56.421 --> 36:59.154
Claustrophobia.

36:59.155 --> 37:00.155
My dad.

37:02.091 --> 37:04.793
Let me guess, issue with snakes?

37:07.063 --> 37:09.095
And you?

37:15.968 --> 37:17.068
Listen to me...

37:17.069 --> 37:19.504
I can't stop the bleeding.

37:19.505 --> 37:20.972
You have to open that door.

37:20.973 --> 37:22.273
If I don't get medical attention...

37:22.274 --> 37:24.075
Yes, Colonel.

37:24.076 --> 37:28.110
No, sir, I do not know who
else is involved in the mutiny.

37:28.111 --> 37:30.079
She's refusing to cooperate.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.815
You're not talking to anyone.

37:32.816 --> 37:34.315
Your radio is off!

37:34.316 --> 37:35.749
What is the matter with you?

37:35.750 --> 37:38.452
Yes, I will continue the interrogation,

37:38.453 --> 37:39.987
but at some point, sir,

37:39.988 --> 37:44.022
we are just better off
ending this once and for all.

37:44.023 --> 37:46.291
Sergeant... Sergeant, listen to me.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.027
Sergeant Greer!

37:50.094 --> 37:53.363
We are not taking over the ship!

37:53.364 --> 37:54.364
What do you got?

37:55.866 --> 37:57.434
Can't get the door open.

37:57.435 --> 38:00.468
Must have been disabled from the inside.

38:00.469 --> 38:01.836
I heard Wray's voice.

38:02.838 --> 38:05.406
Camile?

38:05.407 --> 38:06.772
It's Lieutenant Scott!

38:06.773 --> 38:07.773
Scott, help!

38:07.774 --> 38:09.141
I'm wounded!

38:09.142 --> 38:10.142
Sergeant Greer has got us hostage...

38:10.143 --> 38:11.844
Shut...

38:13.080 --> 38:14.313
Quiet, now.

38:15.547 --> 38:18.115
Sergeant Greer, it's Lieutenant Scott!

38:18.116 --> 38:19.883
Stand down!

38:19.884 --> 38:23.120
Colonel Young, this is Scott, come in.

38:23.121 --> 38:24.219
Yeah.

38:24.220 --> 38:25.087
We found him.

38:25.088 --> 38:27.522
He has locked himself and Wray

38:27.523 --> 38:28.490
in one of the storage rooms.

38:28.491 --> 38:30.058
I think he's holding her hostage.

38:39.934 --> 38:40.999
That's it.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.408
I'm done with you.

38:53.510 --> 38:55.144
Please...

38:55.145 --> 38:56.178
Sergeant...

38:57.479 --> 38:59.880
Don't.

39:03.885 --> 39:05.552
Do it.

39:10.590 --> 39:14.226
I said do it.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.178
Colonel Young...

39:57.591 --> 40:00.427
Colonel, we got 'em.

40:00.428 --> 40:02.328
Send TJ. We...

40:02.329 --> 40:05.063
we have wounded in here.

40:11.470 --> 40:13.037
How you doing?

40:13.038 --> 40:14.203
Okay.

40:14.204 --> 40:16.472
I was able to stop the
bleeding and stitch the wound,

40:16.473 --> 40:18.641
so we'll keep an eye
out for infection, but...

40:18.642 --> 40:21.010
She should be okay.

40:21.011 --> 40:23.043
The rest of the crew?

40:23.044 --> 40:24.144
I checked everyone.

40:24.145 --> 40:26.413
It looks like we got 'em all, so...

40:26.414 --> 40:28.549
Hopefully things will get
back to normal around here.

40:29.951 --> 40:32.217
Whatever that is.

41:46.608 --> 41:50.043
What do we got?

41:50.044 --> 41:52.279
Well, the atmosphere is good.

41:52.280 --> 41:55.046
10 hours on the countdown.

41:59.218 --> 42:02.988
Shall we send a team?

42:02.989 --> 42:05.021
Yeah.

42:05.022 --> 42:07.624
Our luck's got to change at some point.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.058
Just remember the bug spray.

42:12.461 --> 42:14.462
Scott, this is Young.

42:14.463 --> 42:15.963
Get a team ready.

42:15.964 --> 42:17.299
You're going off-world.
